WEBVTT

00:01.914 --> 00:04.482
ADULT ADAM:
Back in the '80s, I had
my fair share of tormentors,

00:04.526 --> 00:06.876
and no one did it better
than my main nemesis,

00:06.919 --> 00:10.140
sax-wailin', pony tail-rockin' Johnny Atkins.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.663
Yep, he made
my life miserable.

00:11.707 --> 00:12.795
Later, nerd losers.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.362
Eat my butt.

00:14.405 --> 00:15.885
I feel threatened,
and I want to punch
your face off.

00:15.928 --> 00:18.540
And, thanks to shop class,
I had to see
a lot more of him.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.932
JOHNNY: Hey, Goldberg.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.760
Whatcha workin' on
there, man?
Looks super cool.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.327
Your interest excites me,

00:23.371 --> 00:25.329
but I'm also certain
that this exchange

00:25.373 --> 00:27.201
will end in a dead leg,
swirlie, or both.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.594
C'mon,
I have a curious soul.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.727
Please, share
your wooden gift with me.Really?

00:31.770 --> 00:34.860
Okay, are you familiar
with the fantasy action
film Highlander?

00:34.904 --> 00:36.949
I am not.
Tell me more!

00:36.993 --> 00:40.692
Well, it's about a race
of immortal swordsmen
who clash throughout history,

00:40.736 --> 00:43.391
and it stars French action
heartthrob
Christopher Lambert!

00:43.434 --> 00:45.045
Sounds rad!

00:45.088 --> 00:48.352
I wish there was a way
I could partake in the joy
and delight it's given you!

00:48.396 --> 00:51.094
I actually have the tape
right here!Nice!

00:51.138 --> 00:52.922
Could you put it down
on the table so I can
take a better look?

00:52.965 --> 00:54.532
You bet.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.276
Atkins, unacceptable!

00:59.320 --> 01:01.539
Goggles on when you use
that machine.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.672
Aw, man,
I helped you do it!

01:03.715 --> 01:05.891
♪ I'm twisted up inside

01:05.935 --> 01:08.851
♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:11.941 --> 01:13.464
♪ I don't know the future

01:13.508 --> 01:16.989
♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪

01:17.033 --> 01:19.557
ADULT ADAM:
It was February 20th,
1980-something,

01:19.601 --> 01:22.821
and my dad had just laid eyes on the perfect parking spot.

01:22.865 --> 01:25.607
Ah, here we go.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.261
Whoa, did you see that?

01:27.304 --> 01:29.828
That schmuck
just stole my space!Oy vey.

01:29.872 --> 01:32.570
Please don't get into
one of your parking battles.

01:32.614 --> 01:35.051
Look, there's an open spot
right back there.
Just go take it.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.966
You really want to
put my dead toe

01:37.009 --> 01:38.924
through three more
spaces of walking?

01:38.968 --> 01:40.361
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,

01:40.404 --> 01:42.406
Pops and Barry braced themselves for one of my dad's

01:42.450 --> 01:45.931
epic parking-spot screaming
matches... Or hug?

01:45.975 --> 01:47.933
Oh, it's so good
to see you!

01:47.977 --> 01:49.109
Wait, it must be
an old friend.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.459
Bink.
A jinga, a janga...

01:51.502 --> 01:53.417
BARRY: What you're
saying is impossible.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.724
My dad only has two friends
in this world,

01:55.767 --> 01:58.161
Bill Lewis and the mailman.
That's it.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.207
Hoo! There he is!
There's my friend Kormy!

02:00.250 --> 02:01.730
Kormy?
Yeah, Steve Korman,

02:01.773 --> 02:02.861
one of my best friends
from Central High.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.254
Wait, you had friends?

02:04.298 --> 02:05.734
I had a whole group
of friends back then.

02:05.777 --> 02:08.389
We were called The Jokers.
That's just like the JTP.

02:08.432 --> 02:09.955
How come you never see
these guys anymore?

02:09.999 --> 02:11.218
Kormy lives in
Lancaster now.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.697
That's way too far.
Too far?

02:12.741 --> 02:15.657
You once
drove out to Delaware
just to get a crab hoagie.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.788
That was a good hoagie.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.747
Yeah,
it had crab in it.Dense crab.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.227
And that bread
was delicious.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.358
I remember that trip.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.794
Yeah. Crab.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.448
Dude, forget the crab.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.450
If Kormy's your friend,
you gotta go see him!

02:26.494 --> 02:28.235
High school friends are nice,

02:28.278 --> 02:30.106
but then life happens,
and you move on.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.197
No, the JTP will always be
inseparable blood brothers

02:34.241 --> 02:35.242
that will be
together forever.

02:35.285 --> 02:36.765
Pops, back me up here.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.984
How's about we take a drive
and talk about it?

02:39.028 --> 02:40.334
Maybe down to that crab place.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.987
All right,
enough with the crab!

02:42.031 --> 02:43.554
We're going to Delaware!

02:43.598 --> 02:45.426
ADULT ADAM:
As Barry feared losing
his best friends,

02:45.469 --> 02:48.255
I was still dealing
with my worst enemy.

02:48.298 --> 02:49.560
Dude, can you move?

02:49.604 --> 02:51.562
Urkel's about to question
whether he did that.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.913
Just gimme a sec.
I gotta find a blank tape
so I can record Highlander.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.567
Wait, I bought you that movie
for your half birthday.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.090
What happened
to that tape?

02:58.134 --> 03:01.703
Uh, I kinda thought
it was a piece of wood
and sawed it in half?

03:01.746 --> 03:03.531
Schmoo, you gotta
be more careful.

03:03.574 --> 03:06.577
Yesterday you lost
the lunch money I gave you
for square pizza day.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.666
Forgetful me.
And the day before that

03:08.710 --> 03:10.755
you got your underpants
caught in your locker,

03:10.799 --> 03:13.671
and they got wedged way up
in the crack
of your little tushie.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.239
Ew, stop.
Clearly, someone's
picking on the kid.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.633
Gah, fine!
It's Johnny Atkins!

03:18.676 --> 03:20.852
It's 'cause I'm not
in school to protect
you anymore, dummy.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.550
Protect me?
Protect him?

03:22.593 --> 03:26.206
Yes. All those years while
you went about your days
blissfully unscathed,

03:26.249 --> 03:27.729
I was working
in the shadows,

03:27.772 --> 03:30.601
ensuring that
no one laid a finger
on your delicate,

03:30.645 --> 03:32.386
under developed
little bird body.ADAM: What?

03:32.429 --> 03:34.431
But I just figured I was
generally accepted and liked!

03:34.475 --> 03:35.606
Oh, God, no.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.695
Well, I guess it's up
to Mama to fix it.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.480
Mom, hear my words.

03:39.523 --> 03:42.744
This is the one thing
on the planet
you cannot fix for me.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.398
Schmoo,
when you were little,

03:44.441 --> 03:46.313
there was always
a mean bully at school

03:46.356 --> 03:48.184
and like always,
Mama fixed it.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.664
How?
Easy!

03:49.707 --> 03:51.622
A play date.
A play date?

03:51.666 --> 03:53.537
Works every time!
I don't need a play date.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.322
I just need to handle this
on my own.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.671
Fine, if that's what
you really want,

03:56.714 --> 03:59.064
I have no choice but
to respect your wishes.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.979
Sup, Goldnerd?

04:01.023 --> 04:03.068
She did not in any way
respect my wishes!

04:03.112 --> 04:04.461
Can we start this
play date already?

04:04.505 --> 04:06.898
Friday nights are when
I deep-condition my ponytail.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.291
Then why did
you agree to this?

04:08.335 --> 04:10.424
I didn't. Your smoking
hot mom forced me.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.208
It's true.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.646
I cornered him in that park
where all the boys and girls
go to study in their cars

04:15.690 --> 04:18.214
and said that I'd scratch
his Celica with a wine opener

04:18.258 --> 04:20.216
if he didn't agree
to a play date.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.566
Totino's Pizza Rolls?
Leave the pizza rolls and go!

04:22.610 --> 04:24.002
Oh, I'll just take out
the trundle bed

04:24.046 --> 04:25.134
in case you want
to sleep over, Jonathan.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.223
Ha, even your room
is nerdy!

04:27.267 --> 04:30.313
Can't wait to tell
everyone at school
your bed has a baby bed.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.750
ADULT ADAM: Turns out
it's impossible to have
a play date

04:32.794 --> 04:34.752
with someone you have
nothing in common with.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.407
Seven!
Goonies never say die!

04:37.451 --> 04:39.322
Do Goonies ever say,
"You're a turd farmer?"

04:39.366 --> 04:41.106
That's a no
on the board games.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.456
Ooh!
You like Ghostbusters?

04:42.499 --> 04:44.762
Check it out.
I got the Ecto-1 Autobot!

04:44.806 --> 04:47.678
How about we make
a stop-motion animation
where it transforms?

04:47.722 --> 04:50.159
How about I transform
my foot up your butt?

04:50.202 --> 04:51.378
How about I just
play a movie

04:51.421 --> 04:52.553
so we don't have
to interact at all?

04:52.596 --> 04:53.641
Now we're talking.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.731
What dumb-ass thing
is this?

04:56.774 --> 04:58.298
Hello?
It's Highlander?

04:58.341 --> 04:59.951
We talked about it
in shop class?

04:59.995 --> 05:01.126
You're in my shop class?

05:01.170 --> 05:02.998
Yeah, let's just watch
in silence.

05:03.041 --> 05:06.044
ADULT ADAM: Lucky for me,
Highlander is so ridiculously badass,

05:06.088 --> 05:08.786
even Johnny Atkins couldn't
deny its awesomeness.

05:08.830 --> 05:09.961
There can be only one.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.181
Dude,
this movie is the best!

05:12.224 --> 05:13.748
Sword fighting!
Queen music!

05:13.791 --> 05:15.750
Sean Connery
rockin' a pony tail!

05:15.793 --> 05:18.796
Is this play date
actually working?No.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.931
Man, I'd give anything
to be immortal,

05:22.974 --> 05:25.934
see all of history unfold
before my very eyes,
you know?

05:25.977 --> 05:28.632
You'd also have to watch
all the people you love die.

05:28.676 --> 05:31.766
So really,
it's a gift and a curse.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.724
Whoa.
I know, bro.

05:33.768 --> 05:37.424
Hey, what if there was a way
to find other people
who like Highlander

05:37.467 --> 05:39.164
and then
we all meet regularly
to talk about it?

05:39.208 --> 05:41.166
Like a club?
Hell yeah!

05:41.210 --> 05:43.168
Boys, it's way too late.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.519
If you're not gonna
settle down, Johnny's
got to sleep downstairs.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.477
No, no! We're going to bed!
I'm, like, already asleep.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.305
ADULT ADAM:
And so I had a new friend.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.829
Meanwhile, Barry was trying
to lock his down forever.

05:51.873 --> 05:54.049
JTP?
ALL:  JTP.

05:54.092 --> 05:56.617
Graduation is 12 weeks away,

05:56.660 --> 06:01.622
which is why I've planned 12
weekends of JTP shenanigans
to cement our friendship.

06:01.665 --> 06:02.797
Awesome!
Yeah!

06:02.840 --> 06:04.755
Dude!
I'll do anything
if it's in a calendar!

06:04.799 --> 06:07.323
That's just the beginning,
'cause I also mapped out

06:07.367 --> 06:09.194
the next 12 months
of our lives.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.632
Wait, 12 months?
Won't we all be
in college then?

06:11.675 --> 06:13.590
Welcome to our futures.

06:13.634 --> 06:16.419
We're gonna visit
each other every weekend,

06:16.463 --> 06:18.552
and, on Thursdays,
we'll have a conference call

06:18.595 --> 06:20.684
from 7:00 p.m.
'til question mark.

06:20.728 --> 06:25.515
Bro, I totally want to
hang out next year, too,
but this feels very intense.

06:25.559 --> 06:28.083
Then hold onto your tiny,
flea-sized hat, Andy!

06:28.126 --> 06:30.999
'Cause I also mapped out
the next 12 years.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.087
Uh-oh.
Dude.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.436
It's in a calendar,
so I gotta do this!

06:33.480 --> 06:36.831
But wait.
Behold the next 12 decades.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.441
First,
we'll all find wives,

06:38.485 --> 06:40.356
get married in
a five-way wedding,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.010
and each have four kids.

06:42.053 --> 06:45.230
Except for Naked Rob,
because he doesn't have
parental instincts,

06:45.274 --> 06:47.537
but will be the cool uncle
to our lousy rugrats.

06:47.581 --> 06:51.019
I do have an uncle vibe,
but you can't map out
our whole lives.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.194
Yeah, I don't think
my future wife

06:52.237 --> 06:53.717
is gonna like
any of this.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.502
You can tell
that nasal-voiced nag

06:55.545 --> 06:57.286
to put a sock in it,
Andrew!

06:57.329 --> 06:58.983
Hey!
You don't get it.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.899
If we don't do this,
the next time
we see each other

07:01.943 --> 07:03.858
will be in a mall parking lot
10 years from now.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.338
Look, Bar, we appreciate
all your unnecessary energy,

07:06.382 --> 07:08.471
but we can't commit
to the next 12 decades,

07:08.515 --> 07:10.255
so, hasta luego?

07:10.299 --> 07:12.301
Don't you dare
swear at me,
Matt Bradley!

07:12.344 --> 07:15.043
ADULT ADAM: While Barry was worried about his buddies drifting apart,

07:15.086 --> 07:17.698
one movie
had brought together
my geeky pals

07:17.741 --> 07:19.917
and Johnny's way cooler
band of friends.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.832
Thanks for coming to
the HighlanderClub.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.661
I see some new faces to the
after-school activities scene.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.749
When do we get
the big knives?

07:25.793 --> 07:26.924
I wanna cut someone
for real!

07:26.968 --> 07:29.884
Love that spirit,
but let's walk before we run.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.494
First, we watch the movie,

07:31.538 --> 07:33.365
then we our pick our roles,

07:33.409 --> 07:34.845
and divvy up scenes
to re-enact!

07:34.889 --> 07:35.933
Pass.
I'm out.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.282
Yeah,
I wish you all the best.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.719
No, screw your safety.
Let's just fight!

07:38.762 --> 07:40.329
But then all
this club will be

07:40.372 --> 07:42.331
is a bunch of people
hitting each other with...

07:42.374 --> 07:44.725
Ow!
Extracurricular activities
are fun!

07:44.768 --> 07:46.944
Ha-ha, that is fun!
I'm back in!

07:46.988 --> 07:49.773
Ow!
Hey, why are there children
in my wood shop

07:49.817 --> 07:51.383
looking all eager
and excited?

07:51.427 --> 07:53.647
We're starting
a HighlanderClub,
and maybe you...

07:53.690 --> 07:56.127
Nah.
Faculty advisors
get a $35 stipend.

07:56.171 --> 07:59.740
Then, as your advisor,
I advise you not
to bother me with stuff.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.785
Yes! He has a laissez-faire
attitude about his role!

08:01.829 --> 08:04.048
Let's go sharpen our swords
and really take our time.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.789
Ow!

08:05.833 --> 08:08.444
Thanks a lot, dude.
You gave all the jerks
in school weapons

08:08.488 --> 08:09.706
and a scheduled time
to beat us.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.316
I know what I did,
Dave Kim,

08:11.360 --> 08:13.493
but maybe it won't be
as bad as we think.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.364
Oh, balls!

08:15.407 --> 08:17.845
Let's shake the nerd trees
and see what falls out.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.803
Adrenaline got me up here,
but I can't sustain it!

08:19.847 --> 08:21.675
Come to Mama, Dave Kim.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.415
Do you think this is
one of those situations

08:23.459 --> 08:25.243
where she's mean to me
because she really likes me?

08:25.287 --> 08:26.984
I don't think so, pal!

08:27.028 --> 08:29.596
What's the plan here, guys?
My hands and legs
are fatigued!

08:29.639 --> 08:31.293
Wait, I got it!

08:31.336 --> 08:33.164
Have any of you seen
the gymnastics action
movie Gymkata?

08:33.208 --> 08:35.036
Screw you and your movies!

08:35.079 --> 08:36.646
That's why we're
in this mess!

08:36.690 --> 08:39.997
Trust me! We just have
to swing to each other
using our core strength

08:40.041 --> 08:41.346
and then form
a human bridge to...

08:41.390 --> 08:42.652
Aah!

08:44.524 --> 08:46.395
Ow!
I was wrong!

08:46.438 --> 08:48.049
It's not a situation
where she likes me!

08:48.092 --> 08:50.268
Ow!

08:50.312 --> 08:53.358
ADULT ADAM:
The JTP may have rejected
Barry's 12-decade plan,

08:53.402 --> 08:54.490
but he wouldn't
let that stop him.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.015
Stop!
Stop beat boxing, JTP.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.540
I've figured out
how we'll stay
friends forever.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.932
Oh, God,
not another plan.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.065
Trust me.
This one is so good,

09:04.108 --> 09:06.894
even Andy's future joyless nag
of a wife can get behind it.

09:06.937 --> 09:10.550
I realize there's only one
logical way to guarantee

09:10.593 --> 09:13.988
we see each other all the time
when we're all grown up.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.338
Liberty Seats
at Veterans Stadium.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.122
Liberty what?

09:18.166 --> 09:21.430
An elite ticket membership
giving us access
to not one, not two,

09:21.473 --> 09:24.738
but 300 nights
of entertainment a year!

09:24.781 --> 09:26.609
These seats offer everything!

09:26.653 --> 09:28.437
The Eagles! Phillies!

09:28.480 --> 09:30.918
That sport you play on ice
with the broom!

09:30.961 --> 09:32.528
Strange religious events!

09:32.572 --> 09:34.617
Local graduation ceremonies.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.663
The Kensington Dog Show.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.969
Michael Jackson,
Jackson Browne,

09:39.013 --> 09:42.669
James Brown, James Taylor,
and Taylor Dayne,

09:42.712 --> 09:45.454
all for the low price
of 10 grand apiece.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.890
10 grand?
Dude, are you nuts?

09:46.934 --> 09:48.065
I have $37.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.806
My wife is gonna
be so pissed.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.155
Well, Andy, tell her to
go  herself.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.374
Whoa!
Whoa!

09:52.417 --> 09:54.202
Whoa-ho-ho!
Dude!

09:54.245 --> 09:55.986
Look, we don't
know what's gonna
happen after high school,

09:56.030 --> 09:57.335
but that doesn't mean we're
gonna stop being friends.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.076
You guys don't get it!

09:59.120 --> 10:02.819
My dad had his own JTP,
and now, if they're lucky,

10:02.863 --> 10:04.821
they only see each other
every 10 years!

10:04.865 --> 10:07.302
Bar, just because they
don't see each other,
doesn't mean we won't.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.565
But their group
was just like ours.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.784
First off,
there's five of them.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.568
Whoa,
that is just like us.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.135
They called themselves
The Jokers.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.180
JTP also starts with a J!

10:16.224 --> 10:18.139
Each of them had nicknames
based in truth!

10:18.182 --> 10:20.707
One of them
was called Tall Jake
'cause he was tall.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.056
I'm Naked Rob
and I like to get naked!

10:22.099 --> 10:23.579
And the similarities
stop there.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.754
We got to get
the Liberty Seats!

10:24.798 --> 10:26.016
I was so against this
five minutes ago,

10:26.060 --> 10:27.757
but now I've never wanted
anything more!

10:27.801 --> 10:29.411
Guys, I might have
a better idea

10:29.454 --> 10:32.022
that won't cost us
thousands of dollars
and hours of our lives.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.677
That can't be true.
Everyone ignore Matt Bradley

10:34.721 --> 10:35.809
and empty your wallets
into my hands.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.245
Yep.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.594
We're just freaked out
we're gonna drift apart

10:38.638 --> 10:39.726
like your dad
and his friends.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.119
But what if we got them
back together?

10:42.163 --> 10:44.556
That's true.
If Barry's extremely
off-putting father

10:44.600 --> 10:45.514
can have
lifelong friends,

10:45.557 --> 10:46.863
then we for sure will,
too.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.909
This paper-thin logic
is oddly comforting!

10:48.952 --> 10:51.172
Wow, Matt Bradley just
had his first good idea.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.913
Thanks maybe.
JTP forever!

10:52.956 --> 10:54.131
TOGETHER: JTP forever!

10:54.175 --> 10:56.351
ADULT ADAM: As the JTP
set off with a plan,

10:56.394 --> 10:59.441
my mom's plan for a play date had majorly backfired.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.921
BEVERLY:
There's my Schmoo.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.401
Ant on a log
coming your way.

11:03.445 --> 11:06.187
Save your logs, lady!
I've got a bone to pick
with you!

11:06.230 --> 11:08.929
Let me guess.
Play date backfired, and now
it's 10 times worse?

11:08.972 --> 11:10.582
Yes!

11:10.626 --> 11:13.281
Thanks to Johnny,
a bunch of cool older
dudes in school

11:13.324 --> 11:14.978
have united to form
a nerd hit squad.

11:15.022 --> 11:18.242
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.
Just let Mama fix it.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.506
I'll invite Johnny
and the whole gang over
for a big group play date.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.943
ADULT ADAM: Group play date?

11:22.986 --> 11:24.901
The crazy lady
had to be stopped.

11:24.945 --> 11:28.078
I had no choice but to leave
Johnny'sHighlander Club
and start my own.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.689
Hey, Mr. Crosby,
you got a sec?

11:29.732 --> 11:31.168
Nope.
Good.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.866
With your permission,
we'd like to start a new,

11:32.909 --> 11:35.259
second, more gentle
HighlanderClub.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.522
No.
What? Why not?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.524
Because there
can be only one!

11:39.568 --> 11:40.612
HighlanderClub.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.571
M-Maybe there can be two?

11:42.614 --> 11:43.964
Dude! You're
starting your own club

11:44.007 --> 11:45.748
based on the movie
I introduced you to?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.402
This betrayal
will not stand!

11:47.445 --> 11:50.144
My HighlanderClub challenges
yours to a battle!

11:50.187 --> 11:51.667
We have no club!

11:51.711 --> 11:55.062
Mr. Crosby specifically said
there can be only one!

11:55.105 --> 11:57.586
Actually,
this challenge makes sense.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.806
Like the epic conflict
between Connor MacLeod

11:59.849 --> 12:02.460
and the fearsome
but misunderstood Kurgan,

12:02.504 --> 12:04.549
you must both fight
for "the prize."

12:04.593 --> 12:06.421
You will fight
only in the shadows,

12:06.464 --> 12:08.423
never in woodshop!

12:08.466 --> 12:11.339
Consider this holy ground
because I don't want
you touching my stuff.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.646
If a sword touches
your neck or your
lower head, you are out.

12:14.690 --> 12:18.650
The last one standing
earns the right to lead
his own HighlanderClub.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.436
Or, maybe
there can be two?

12:21.479 --> 12:23.568
Nope,
there can be only one!

12:23.612 --> 12:24.656
HighlanderClub.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.484
See you in the hallways,
dorks.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.226
ADULT ADAM: With that,
the future of the club
was up for grabs,

12:29.270 --> 12:32.229
and Barry was gonna reunite
our dad with his past.

12:32.273 --> 12:35.667
Thanks for coming
out with me and the JTP
for my birthday, Dad!

12:35.711 --> 12:37.234
Whatever you want, pal.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.237
I definitely knew
it was your birthday
because I'm a good dad.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.848
There he is!
Mur Man!

12:41.891 --> 12:43.632
Kormy!
What the hell?

12:43.675 --> 12:46.591
Surprise!
It's devastating that
you don't know this,

12:46.635 --> 12:47.941
but it's not my birthday!

12:47.984 --> 12:49.420
We got all The Jokers
back together!

12:49.464 --> 12:51.814
You sons of bitches,
how ya been?

12:51.858 --> 12:53.381
Better now that
you're here, Smiles.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.861
Did they just call
your dad "Smiles"?

12:54.904 --> 12:56.688
Looking good,
Dancing Bruce,

12:56.732 --> 12:58.778
or should I say
the honorable
Dancing Bruce.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.475
All rise to boogie!

13:00.518 --> 13:02.433
Are they called The Jokers
'cause they're bad at jokes?

13:02.477 --> 13:03.870
The Jokers!

13:05.480 --> 13:07.134
Morons, you did good.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.179
That was the best night
I've had in a long time.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.921
So, uh, when do you want
to see The Jokers again?

13:11.965 --> 13:14.750
I don't know. Uh, maybe
I'll run into one of them
in a couple of years.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.447
And that's it?
Yeah.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.754
But you had so much fun.
Don't you want
to do this more?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.321
Yeah, maybe you guys should
start a bowling team.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.018
Why do any of you care
what I do?

13:22.062 --> 13:23.106
Or a weekly barbecue.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.239
Who are you?
Who is this moron?

13:25.282 --> 13:26.370
Geoff Schwartz.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.546
You know my parents.
I'm dating your daughter.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.245
Dad, if you only see your
friends once a decade,

13:31.288 --> 13:32.986
they're not really
your friends.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.205
I don't know
what to tell you.
Life goes on.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.903
You get old,
you get married,

13:36.946 --> 13:38.208
your friends fall
by the wayside.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.257
Does he really
not know me?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.433
ADAM: Erica, wake up!
It's the middle of the day!

13:45.476 --> 13:47.391
We need you!
Leave me alone.
It's Sunday.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.784
It's Thursday.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.569
Ooh, I missed
a job interview
this morning.

13:51.613 --> 13:54.050
Guess the universe
doesn't want me
to be a sandwich artist.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.835
You know what
the universe does want?

13:55.878 --> 13:57.880
For you to protect me
like the old days
when I was safe and free.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.969
But it doesn't
teach you anything.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.667
C'mon,
it's time you finally learn
to stick up for yourself.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.060
Maybe I wasn't clear.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.714
I don't need hollow words.

14:05.757 --> 14:08.456
I need you
to ball up your fists
and wreck some fools!

14:08.499 --> 14:10.762
Dude, you can't just
rely on other people to
fight your battles.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.939
Does someone
need to rely on me
to fight his battles?

14:12.982 --> 14:14.375
See? You either
stand up and fight

14:14.418 --> 14:15.637
or face a lifetime
of play dates.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.856
Play dates obviously.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.466
Obviously.
Yeah.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.382
No!
My groggy sister may have
no purpose or prospects,

14:21.425 --> 14:23.645
but she's right.
We have to fight back

14:23.688 --> 14:26.474
'cause we have something
that Johnny Atkins
and his crew don't have.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.823
All their baby teeth?
No.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.346
A crush on their cousin?
No!

14:29.390 --> 14:30.826
Their very own fern?
No!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.567
A mama who will fix it?
No!

14:32.610 --> 14:34.395
We are all skilled
with the blade.

14:34.438 --> 14:37.050
I myself have a lifetime of
training with a lightsaber.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.182
You also have a mama
who will fix it.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.141
Mikey, Sirota,
you both learned
a ton of stage combat

14:41.184 --> 14:42.707
when you played Tybalt
and Mercutio

14:42.751 --> 14:44.274
in Romeo and Juliet,
right?

14:44.318 --> 14:45.362
Yeah.
True.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.624
And, Dan,
your malnourished body

14:46.668 --> 14:49.018
has less surface area
to poke and stab.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.280
My pediatrician
is concerned.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.630
Which is why you need
someone's mama to fix it!

14:52.674 --> 14:54.589
Why are you not
getting this?

14:54.632 --> 14:56.983
Dave Kim,
your turtleneck protects
your neck and extremities

14:57.026 --> 14:58.071
in a way
no one can penetrate!

14:58.114 --> 14:59.986
That's neither true
nor a skill,

15:00.029 --> 15:01.161
but your confidence
has me amped!

15:01.204 --> 15:02.553
What just happened?

15:02.597 --> 15:05.034
Adam finally realized
that my advice
is better than yours.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.602
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go
cut my own hair.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.779
There can be only one,
and it shall be
the five of us!

15:10.822 --> 15:11.911
Wha!

15:11.954 --> 15:13.129
Rah!
Aah!

15:13.173 --> 15:17.133
♪ We're the princes
of the universe

15:17.177 --> 15:18.656
♪ Here we belong ♪

15:18.700 --> 15:22.791
Johnny Atkins!
Let our hour-long
feud end here!

15:22.834 --> 15:24.880
Fine!
There can be only one!

15:24.924 --> 15:27.622
HighlanderClub.
Yah!

15:37.893 --> 15:39.112
Aah!

15:39.851 --> 15:41.549
JOHNNY: Oh, no!

15:41.592 --> 15:44.465
The nerds are super
fired up and have
unwarranted confidence!

15:44.508 --> 15:45.814
How is this happening?

15:47.294 --> 15:48.904
ADULT ADAM: I'll tell you how.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.952
While Johnny and his friends spent their weekends partying and living it up,

15:52.995 --> 15:55.476
me and my friends
spent our time
swinging around lightsabers

15:55.519 --> 15:58.870
and perfecting
our stage combat
moves for drama club.

15:58.914 --> 16:03.484
That fateful day,
being geeks all our lives
had finally paid off.

16:03.527 --> 16:04.746
Yeah!

16:15.757 --> 16:17.150
Do you yield?
Totally.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.988
Dude, that's sorta
my girlfriend!

16:29.031 --> 16:30.163
Hey, Atkins.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.732
Ow, dang it, man.
That slightly hurt
for a second.

16:34.776 --> 16:37.431
The club belongs to us,
which means you can
go crawling back

16:37.474 --> 16:39.389
to your charmed,
awesome lives.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.261
Wait, we can't be
in your club?

16:41.304 --> 16:43.437
Yeah,
this was surprisingly fun.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.179
Sorry, boys,
enrollment is closed.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.137
But I've never been kicked out
of anything before!

16:48.181 --> 16:50.531
Wanna just go back to scoring
touchdowns and getting girls?

16:50.574 --> 16:52.185
Sure.
That works.

16:57.364 --> 17:00.062
What do I do
with this stuff?

17:00.106 --> 17:01.933
ADULT ADAM: Having finally
conquered my bully,

17:01.977 --> 17:04.675
I came home to celebrate, but there was one more battle left to fight.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.721
Greetings, aimless sister.

17:06.764 --> 17:09.115
Thy brother
has returned a hero.Wow.

17:09.158 --> 17:10.464
He thirsts for beer
of the root.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.640
Finally beat a bully,
and yet you're nerdier
than ever.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.946
Thank you.
You know, my whole life,
I've been hearing

17:14.990 --> 17:18.037
"Mama will fix it,"
and a part of me
wanted her to.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.473
Believe me,
I really get it.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.910
Well, thanks to you,
I finally think the days

17:21.953 --> 17:24.304
of her getting involved
in my relationships are over.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.567
You are
in deep trouble,
mister.

17:26.610 --> 17:29.700
Shame on you for picking
on this poor boy.Tell him, Mrs. G.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.572
Dude, did you go to
my mom to fix it?

17:31.615 --> 17:32.703
I had no choice.

17:32.747 --> 17:33.878
Your mean behavior
made me feel

17:33.922 --> 17:35.967
completely small
and powerless.

17:36.011 --> 17:39.536
Hello? The minute Erica
stopped protecting me,
that's what you did to me!

17:39.580 --> 17:42.670
Schmoopaloo.
Ba-bap!
I'm gonna fix it.

17:42.713 --> 17:46.282
Look, you have a true,
wonderful gift
for busting balls,

17:46.326 --> 17:48.154
but you use it for evil!

17:48.197 --> 17:49.981
All I did was show you
how it feels.

17:50.025 --> 17:52.506
But the difference is
I did all that stuff
before we were friends.

17:52.549 --> 17:53.985
You think we're friends?

17:54.029 --> 17:55.596
Well, yeah?
Don't you?

17:55.639 --> 17:58.207
If we're friends,
then why'd
you take over my club?

17:58.251 --> 18:01.471
Dude, it was our club,
but then you started
a new one without me,

18:01.515 --> 18:03.256
and then you destroyed
my old club,

18:03.299 --> 18:05.040
and then Dave Kim
stole my girlfriend,

18:05.084 --> 18:06.476
and all my friends went back
to playing sports.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.130
Wow.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.653
Guess I am the bully.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.003
Maybe we just call it even?

18:12.047 --> 18:13.701
I got a bootleg
of Highlander 2.

18:13.744 --> 18:14.571
Thought maybe we could
check it out.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.138
Oh, man, yes!

18:16.182 --> 18:18.097
Prepare to be majorly
disappointed.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.448
Wow.
Play dates do work.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.276
Aww.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.147
You're a good daughter.

18:25.191 --> 18:28.237
And an even better sister
for protecting Adam
all those years.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.761
I love the little nerd.
Just don't tell him that.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.242
ADULT ADAM: In the end,
I didn't need my mom's help,

18:33.286 --> 18:35.723
but it turns out my dad
needed Barry's.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.204
TOGETHER:
E-A-G-L-E-S Eagles!

18:40.075 --> 18:42.425
I thought you said
you were good
for another 10 years?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.035
Well, I had such
a great time
the other night

18:44.079 --> 18:46.516
that I wanted
to see them again.
You happy?

18:46.560 --> 18:49.171
Doesn't mean the JTP
won't drift apart
like you guys did.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.347
No, no, no.
You guys won't

18:51.391 --> 18:54.611
because you have the one thing
that we never had.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.873
You.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.049
You care so much
about your friends

18:58.093 --> 18:59.312
that you got me
back together with mine.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.142
Everyone needs a friend
like you, moron.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.752
Thanks, Dad.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.493
Thank you.

19:06.536 --> 19:09.235
ADULT ADAM: Barry had come up with a million ways to keep the JTP together,

19:09.278 --> 19:12.542
but seeing my dad,
he realized
all he needed was one.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.022
Hey.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.154
I got you
a little something.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.807
What is all this?

19:16.851 --> 19:20.463
I know it's not realistic
to map out
the next 120 years,

19:20.507 --> 19:23.031
but I can at least reserve
eight days a year.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.815
That sound doable.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.426
Good.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.515
'Cause I'm gonna work
my ass off as a doctor

19:28.558 --> 19:31.126
so I can buy
five season tickets
to the Eagles games

19:31.170 --> 19:32.649
for the rest of our lives.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.563
Dude, are you serious?

19:33.607 --> 19:34.782
JTP forever.

19:34.825 --> 19:35.913
JTP forever.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.263
ALL: JTP forever.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.916
Andy, your hand's so small.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.832
♪ Oh, yeah

19:41.876 --> 19:43.921
♪ I need somebody

19:43.965 --> 19:46.707
ADULT ADAM:
Turns out the JTP
really is forever.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.840
To this day, they still go
to those Eagles games,

19:49.884 --> 19:52.930
wear those same jerseys,
and laugh like the old days.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.106
That's the thing
about friendship.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.979
Whether your lifelong pals
or a newly forged alliance,

19:58.022 --> 20:00.982
in the end, whatever battles
and hardships you face,

20:01.025 --> 20:03.376
you can do it together.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.029
♪ I need somebody

20:05.073 --> 20:06.466
♪ Yeah, what about you

20:06.509 --> 20:09.251
♪ We all need somebody ♪

20:12.515 --> 20:15.344
I'm here with
the real Mike Levy
and Dave Sirota.

20:15.388 --> 20:18.217
They've been friends with
the real Adam Goldberg
since childhood.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.175
Now, this episode is about
the HighlanderClub.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.872
Is it real?
Yes, we did this
in high school.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.961
It was a point of ridicule,

20:24.005 --> 20:25.354
and then became a point
of fascination,

20:25.398 --> 20:27.487
and then it became
a full-fledged phenomenon.

20:27.530 --> 20:32.796
The HighlanderClub actually
did bring people together
at our high school.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.843
We became friends
with Corbett through
theHighlander Club.

20:35.886 --> 20:39.716
We had the captain
of the football team
all sword playing.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.675
I particularly liked
just saying,

20:41.718 --> 20:43.677
over and over again,
"There can be only one."

20:43.720 --> 20:45.113
Rah!
Aah!

20:45.156 --> 20:46.854
What eventually happened
to the HighlanderClub?

20:46.897 --> 20:48.551
The HighlanderClub
was forcibly disbanded

20:48.595 --> 20:50.553
by the school
administration.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.686
I can't believe I'm
in an actual school club.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.470
Yeah, now you finally
have something

20:54.514 --> 20:56.124
to put on your
college resume.College?

20:56.167 --> 20:58.169
You blew it, Carla.

20:58.213 --> 21:00.302
You'll rue the day you ever
picked Dave Kim over me.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.869
I'm a potential
college applicant now.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.392
Um, yeah, right.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.568
Davey K. respects me,
listens to me,

21:05.612 --> 21:08.354
and hides from me
because I terrify him.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.920
It's so hot.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.227
Damn it!
I love her!

21:12.271 --> 21:13.968
Tell me
exactly what I got to do

21:14.011 --> 21:15.404
to get
into a fancy college

21:15.448 --> 21:18.320
and become a rich,
international man of business.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.801
I guess you can start by
going to the college fair
they have every year.

21:20.844 --> 21:24.370
Too much work. I'm out.
Your advice sucks, Goldnerd.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.459
I wish we never
had that play date.
