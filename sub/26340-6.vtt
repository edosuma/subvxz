WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:01.902
Only on Fox.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.642
SID:
Ooh-wee.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.044
Five more minutes
till the big grand prize raffle.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.746
You got your ticket, Hank?

00:11.779 --> 00:14.315
You know it.
I need that TV, baby.

00:14.349 --> 00:16.317
All I got is this
grainy-ass Zenith

00:16.351 --> 00:21.155
with a VHS copy
of 13 Going on 3 stuck inside.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.724
Now, that's a hell of a movie,
but that is a bummer, man.

00:23.758 --> 00:26.761
-(computer chimes)
-Uhp, got an e-mail.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.264
-From my son.
-Oh!

00:29.297 --> 00:31.031
Hope it's good news.

00:31.065 --> 00:34.602
The boy says, "Hey, Pop."

00:35.870 --> 00:38.072
(laughs)

00:38.105 --> 00:41.008
That's a really
good start, Hank.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.111
"Just reaching out
to let you know

00:44.144 --> 00:47.982
"that Mom is getting
remarried...

00:49.216 --> 00:51.786
-...to Reggie."
-Oh, Hank.

00:51.819 --> 00:55.956
I am so sorry. Who's Reggie?

00:55.990 --> 00:58.393
Well, remember when Hank's
ex-wife Lorraine cheated on him

00:58.426 --> 01:00.194
with that great big
football player

01:00.227 --> 01:01.596
who lived in his building?

01:01.629 --> 01:02.797
(whispers):
That's Reggie.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.399
(laughs):
That's right.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.734
And-and Hank said he could
hear the sound of them

01:06.767 --> 01:08.369
making love upstairs.

01:08.403 --> 01:09.770
Uh, what was it,
it was something like...

01:09.804 --> 01:11.739
(squeaking)

01:11.772 --> 01:14.775
No, no, no.
(high-pitched squeaking)

01:19.179 --> 01:21.181
*

01:41.201 --> 01:43.170
Hank, are you sure you're okay?

01:43.203 --> 01:46.341
Your ex-wife getting remarried
is a really big deal,

01:46.374 --> 01:50.478
and your calmness
is kind of freaking us out.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.614
No, I'm fine. In fact,
I was just about to write

01:53.648 --> 01:57.017
a reply e-mail to my son,
telling him how fine I feel.

01:57.051 --> 01:58.252
(clears throat)

01:58.285 --> 02:01.088
"Dear son, I'm fine."

02:01.121 --> 02:03.157
-Send. See?
-(computer whooshes)

02:03.190 --> 02:06.527
You know, Hank,
you don't have to pretend.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.763
I mean, I've been there.
When my cheating ex-husband

02:08.796 --> 02:11.298
got remarried, boy, it sucked,

02:11.332 --> 02:14.769
and I held onto the anger about
it for a long time. Too long.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.005
Nah, I feel good. I mean,
really, really, really, really,

02:18.038 --> 02:20.040
really, really, really, really,
really, really good.

02:20.074 --> 02:23.711
She's moved on and so have I.
That book is closed.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.846
Are you sure?
Because your brain looks like

02:25.880 --> 02:28.215
it's throbbing
through your scalp.

02:28.248 --> 02:31.285
Well, that's because I'm excited
about the raffle.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.288
You know, uh, the brain works
overtime during raffles.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.057
Four out of five
raffle scientists agree.

02:37.091 --> 02:41.562
You can't argue with four out
of five raffle scientists.

02:41.596 --> 02:44.198
Good morning, everyone.

02:44.231 --> 02:47.167
I need to get made up for my
stupid sister's stupid wedding,

02:47.201 --> 02:50.170
so let's get through
this quick, capisce?

02:50.204 --> 02:53.040
Boy, she knows how to make
an event fun, doesn't she?

02:53.073 --> 02:54.842
All right, give me that TV.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.911
(laughs)
Come on down to Hankytown.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.979
Today's my lucky day!

02:59.013 --> 03:01.315
Oh, God, I hope he wins this TV.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.484
Well, what about us?
I could use a little high-def

03:03.518 --> 03:05.352
Bradley Cooper in my life.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.221
No, no, no.
I have been in his shoes.

03:07.254 --> 03:09.323
He needs this
a lot more than we do.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.559
He seems to be taking it
just fine to me.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.429
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.230
And the winner

03:16.263 --> 03:19.534
of this beautiful 65-inch TV set

03:19.567 --> 03:23.704
is number 4-3...

03:23.738 --> 03:26.106
-5...
-623.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.075
-6...
-Come on, come on!
Say it, Allison!

03:28.108 --> 03:29.109
-623.
-2...

03:29.143 --> 03:31.078
-623!
-629.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.547
(yells)

03:32.580 --> 03:34.782
Yes!

03:34.815 --> 03:38.318
All I do is win.
(laughs)

03:39.920 --> 03:42.222
Ah, let me see,
which one of these is it?

03:42.256 --> 03:46.026
What? This hater bought up
every ticket in the place.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.228
He won by cheating.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.431
It's not cheating, Hank.

03:50.465 --> 03:52.266
I just bought more tickets.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.101
Look, to put it another way,

03:54.134 --> 03:58.539
I won because I've got more
money than you.

03:58.573 --> 04:02.443
That's America, baby doll.

04:02.477 --> 04:06.046
Gorgeous George, I will slap
that mustache off your face

04:06.080 --> 04:09.149
-and kick it down the hallway!
-Hold it, bud.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.118
I can't restrain you
the way I used to.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.321
Last week, I threw my back out
throwing my shoulder out.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.256
Want us to deliver it
to your room?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.925
(groans)

04:17.958 --> 04:19.994
Well, I've already got
more televisions

04:20.027 --> 04:21.662
than I know what to do with.

04:21.696 --> 04:26.233
Plus, all of them are so much
nicer than this one.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.970
Then give it to me! Gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!

04:30.004 --> 04:33.808
Install it in my crapper.

04:33.841 --> 04:37.244
I'll listen to my programs
as I shower.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.414
You're gonna listen to a 4K TV?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.817
That is a waste of K's!

04:42.850 --> 04:44.284
Allison!

04:44.318 --> 04:47.154
For once in your miserable life,

04:47.187 --> 04:50.424
do something!

04:50.457 --> 04:53.628
Guys, put the TV
in my office for now.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.763
George,
we'll install it tomorrow.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.964
Okay.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.766
Here.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.768
Here's five bucks.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.237
Save up for a new TV.

05:05.339 --> 05:09.109
Loser.
(groans)

05:09.143 --> 05:11.512
Oh, man, you didn't need that

05:11.546 --> 05:13.781
on top of everything
with your wife.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.516
This isn't about my ex-wife.

05:15.550 --> 05:18.519
This is about me and that TV.
We belong together.

05:18.553 --> 05:22.189
In sickness and in health,
for better or for worse.

05:24.859 --> 05:28.262
Till death do us part!

05:30.230 --> 05:34.168
You guys, call me cuckoo,

05:34.201 --> 05:36.804
but I'm starting to think
that this anger

05:36.837 --> 05:39.206
may be about his ex-wife.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.213
We need to do
something for Hank.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.815
I haven't seen him this upset

05:47.848 --> 05:52.019
since he found out that
RadioShack went out of business.

05:52.052 --> 05:57.057
Yeah, we kept it from him
as long as we could.

05:57.091 --> 06:01.195
We all know what you're driving
at, Margaret, and I accept.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.398
I'll talk to Hank and get him
to open up about his ex.

06:04.431 --> 06:07.501
And I'll even do it for free.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.370
Sid, there's no way in hell
that he is gonna open up to you.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.040
(laughs): And why
would we pay you for it?

06:13.073 --> 06:16.110
Because I'm the most sensitive
person in the group.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.679
Are you stupid, Margaret?

06:18.713 --> 06:20.881
I'm a great listener.

06:20.915 --> 06:22.449
-Sid...
-Uh-uh-uh!

06:22.482 --> 06:25.185
I'm not through yet, Margaret.

06:25.219 --> 06:30.124
People say that empathy
is my superpower.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.727
(laughs)
Who has said that to you?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.795
Well, it's more like
a whisper on the wind,

06:34.829 --> 06:37.598
rather than a specific person,

06:37.632 --> 06:40.100
but I will get Hank
to talk about Lorraine.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.036
Hank doesn't open up
about his feelings.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.438
He's proud, he's insecure,

06:44.471 --> 06:48.676
he's quiet, he's a man.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.546
No, what Hank needs is a win.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.114
Yep.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.116
What do you mean?

06:56.150 --> 06:57.952
I know what Hank
is going through.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.920
When my cheating ex-husband
got remarried,

06:59.954 --> 07:02.890
I went to a very,
very dark place.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.492
What, like, bingeing ice cream?

07:05.525 --> 07:09.296
No, I put a pound of cocaine
in his honeymoon luggage.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.735
We need to do something
to turn Hank's mood around.

07:14.769 --> 07:16.637
I think we should
make this Hank day.

07:16.671 --> 07:19.940
We'll do whatever he wants
to do, no matter how stupid.

07:19.974 --> 07:21.776
All right, everybody, listen up.

07:21.809 --> 07:25.612
I decided what I'm gonna do
about this, uh, TV issue.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.248
I want to steal the TV
out of Allison's office.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.850
Now before y'all
shout me down...

07:29.884 --> 07:31.585
-I think that's a great idea.
-Yay, Hank!

07:31.618 --> 07:34.454
Y'all never listen to my ideas!
This is about justice.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.256
-We're all on board, Hank.
-We're there.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.659
-You are?
-Yeah.

07:38.693 --> 07:40.895
Well, cool.
Then let's go steal that TV.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.707
All right, so let's get started
planning this heist,

07:52.740 --> 07:54.141
which I am calling
"Hank's Eleven."

07:54.174 --> 07:55.710
-So...
-Uh, h-hold on.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.145
Uh, Hank's Eleven?
There's only four of us.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.514
Yeah, the movie was called
Ocean's Eleven

08:00.547 --> 08:02.549
because there were 11 people.

08:02.582 --> 08:05.119
No, because the heist took place
at 11:00 at night.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.154
So, wait a minute,
by that logic,

08:07.187 --> 08:10.825
then Ocean's Thirteen took place
at 13:00?

08:10.858 --> 08:13.660
That's correct. Military time.

08:13.694 --> 08:17.131
I think it's an excellent name
for a heist. We all do.

08:17.164 --> 08:21.802
So here's how Hank's Eleven...

08:21.836 --> 08:23.637
is gonna go down:

08:23.670 --> 08:27.007
so the TV is currently
in Allison's office, now...

08:27.041 --> 08:30.677
You know, Hank, if I may,
I am somewhat of a heist expert,

08:30.711 --> 08:33.013
and I've taken the liberty

08:33.047 --> 08:36.483
to create this scale model

08:36.516 --> 08:37.918
of Shady Meadows.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.353
(gasping)

08:39.386 --> 08:41.088
Wow.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.690
When did you have time
to make this?

08:43.724 --> 08:47.594
I'm 70. When didn't I have time
to make this?

08:47.627 --> 08:49.163
Well, either way,

08:49.196 --> 08:51.431
I think we're following
Hank's lead here, aren't we?

08:51.465 --> 08:54.869
Or, or, or, or, or...
Hank could have a chat

08:54.902 --> 08:57.671
with the most empathetic person
in the room.

08:57.704 --> 09:02.109
Some people call me
Mr. Emotions Man.

09:03.577 --> 09:07.214
Just drop it, Sid.
That book is closed.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.216
We're stealing the TV.
That's it.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.951
Okay, let's get back
to the plan now.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.687
This gingerbread man,
which represents Hank,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.690
will release laughing gas
in the vents...

09:16.723 --> 09:20.527
Well, first of all,
I want to be a cooler cookie.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.296
And where are we gonna
get laughing gas?

09:22.329 --> 09:24.765
Well, my friend Mitch
is a dentist,

09:24.799 --> 09:26.934
or he was a dentist,
until he lost his license

09:26.967 --> 09:29.303
for selling laughing gas.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.471
MARGARET: I don't think we're
gonna need the laughing gas.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.208
I think what Hank was
probably going to say

09:34.241 --> 09:35.976
is that all we have to do

09:36.010 --> 09:37.978
is wait until everybody
is asleep.

09:38.012 --> 09:42.116
We will sneak into Allison's
office and we will take the TV.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.084
Well, that's exactly
what I was gonna say.

09:44.118 --> 09:45.986
I would've thrown in a couple
more, uh, "Hank's Elevens"

09:46.020 --> 09:48.222
up in there, but that's
basically the gist of it.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.157
All right.
This is gonna be easy.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.591
It's a retirement community.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.061
All we have to do is stay awake
till 9:30.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.595
-Whoa, now. Wait, wait a minute.
-No!
-No.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.431
Oh, all right, 9:00.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.306
All right, so what
we have to do is--

10:06.340 --> 10:07.774
back up, back up, back up!

10:09.143 --> 10:11.812
Why is she still
in her office at 9:00?

10:11.846 --> 10:13.613
Doesn't she get off work
at 6:00?

10:13.647 --> 10:17.284
Oh, honey, she hasn't
gotten off in years.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.754
Yeah, I guess the fatal flaw
of this whole plan is we forgot

10:20.787 --> 10:23.490
that Allison
is a gigantic loser.

10:23.523 --> 10:27.527
GIRL (over computer):
It's prom season, betches!

10:27.561 --> 10:29.263
And if you want
the perfect smoky eye

10:29.296 --> 10:32.867
to get you the perfect
smokin' guy...

10:32.900 --> 10:34.601
Oh, this is pathetic.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.203
The woman is 40 years old

10:36.236 --> 10:39.239
and doesn't know
how to do a smoky eye?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.177
Now all we have to do
is think of something

10:43.210 --> 10:46.046
that'll get Allison
out of her office, fast.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.548
Got it.

10:50.084 --> 10:53.053
Allison, get out
of your office, fast.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.122
Why? What?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.357
Sid just passed out
all up in the sauna.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.626
GIRL (over computer):
All right, betches.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.662
Now let's clean up
that bikini line.

11:20.214 --> 11:23.650
Help! Help! Woe is me!

11:23.683 --> 11:25.585
(shouts)

11:25.619 --> 11:27.587
Ah, boy, we're too late.

11:27.621 --> 11:30.157
Rest in peace, tiny angel.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.659
-Allison!
-Whoa!

11:32.692 --> 11:35.429
Ah, what the heck? I just spoke.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.764
Uh-oh. The door is locked.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.566
-I'm-a go get help.
-No, wait, wait.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.834
I'm still in here.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.337
Good luck in there,
Mr. Emotions Man.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.839
You can lock the door on me,

11:45.872 --> 11:49.543
but you cannot lock the door
on your feelings!

11:51.578 --> 11:54.581
I mean, this is all a total
and complete accident.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.650
Nothing is afoot.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.798
I still think that we all
should be wearing ski masks.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.468
I mean, w-who does a heist
without a ski mask?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.703
It's embarrassing.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.639
This is not your heist.
We're doing this for Hank.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.642
Well, you know, the craziest
thing just happened.

12:22.676 --> 12:25.879
Yeah, I just found out
that one of my ex-wives

12:25.912 --> 12:27.781
is getting remarried--
oh, yeah...

12:27.814 --> 12:29.883
I'm not buying it, Charlie.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.819
-Please?
-No.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.321
Mission accomplished.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.991
Allison and Sid are locked up
in the sauna.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.792
-Huh.
-Sid's okay with that?

12:38.825 --> 12:42.896
Uh... uh-huh.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.898
And this has nothing to do
with the fact that he wants you

12:44.931 --> 12:46.900
to talk about your ex-wife?

12:46.933 --> 12:50.470
Uh... uh-uh.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.139
Okay. Well, all very believable.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.873
It's your heist.

12:57.111 --> 12:59.079
-Crap. It's locked.
-Oh...

12:59.113 --> 13:02.016
Well, we're gonna
have to jimmy the lock.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.417
Charlie, run down the hall
and be a lookout

13:03.450 --> 13:05.085
while Margaret and I break in.

13:05.119 --> 13:07.954
(chuckles): A lookout?
I'm the mastermind.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.823
You don't ask the mastermind
be the lookout.

13:09.856 --> 13:15.629
That's like asking the general
to be the... lookout.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.832
-(mouths)
-All right.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.600
How are we gonna
jimmy this lock?

13:20.634 --> 13:25.472
With the help of my old friend,
my RadioShack rewards card.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.676
(doorknob rattling)

13:32.312 --> 13:33.913
It won't budge. You try.

13:40.254 --> 13:43.057
Help! Let us out!

13:43.090 --> 13:45.492
Ooh, my fingers smell funny.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.628
I think they're cooking
in the heat.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.465
Should I eat them?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.700
How long have we been in here?

13:53.733 --> 13:56.503
Seven minutes.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.937
(shouts)

13:59.206 --> 14:00.540
(shouts)

14:00.574 --> 14:02.542
Uh-- uh, what?

14:02.576 --> 14:03.977
Does my makeup look weird?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.379
Oh, honey, you look like
somebody put Beetlejuice

14:05.412 --> 14:07.514
in the microwave.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.416
Oh, great. Beetlejuice.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.652
That's the wedding look
I was going for. Beetlejuice.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.588
"Hey, which bridesmaid
you want to hook up with?"

14:14.621 --> 14:15.822
"The one that looks
like Beetle..."

14:15.855 --> 14:17.857
Don't say it a third time!

14:17.891 --> 14:20.394
Unless you want
a real problem on your hands.

14:21.628 --> 14:25.999
Well, we're officially stuck.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.534
I guess the one upside
is I might miss

14:27.567 --> 14:30.204
my stupid, self-obsessed
sister's wedding.

14:30.237 --> 14:33.907
Hmm, you know, Allison, I have
a skill that some people call

14:33.940 --> 14:35.909
a superpower.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.911
Don't let this freak you out,
but I'm sensing

14:37.944 --> 14:41.715
you have some problems
with your sister.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.718
Yeah, I just said that.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.720
Look, the thing is,

14:46.753 --> 14:48.388
my sister's always been
the star of the family,

14:48.422 --> 14:50.690
a-and I never get any attention.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.459
Mm.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.729
Yeah, so you were hoping that
maybe if you got married first,

14:55.762 --> 14:57.764
you'd gain some ground
on your sister,

14:57.797 --> 14:59.766
but, honey, that ship
is sailing fast,

14:59.799 --> 15:03.036
and there's a brisk wind
behind it.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.639
And I'm standing
all alone on the dock.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.741
Looking like Beetlejuice.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.910
Damn it, Allison!
You said it a third time!

15:10.944 --> 15:14.181
Brace yourself. It's about
to get real crowded in here.

15:17.784 --> 15:22.789
There she is.
There's my beautiful television.

15:22.822 --> 15:25.725
Damn, girl, you sure look sexy.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.494
(laughs)

15:27.527 --> 15:30.830
Looks like Hank's Eleven has
fallen into place.

15:30.864 --> 15:33.467
I'm like a combination
of George Clooney, Brad Pitt

15:33.500 --> 15:35.569
and Matt Damon
all rolled up into one.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.071
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.275
You are a genius, Hank.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.010
Wait a minute.

15:44.043 --> 15:47.080
Did you just call me a genius?

15:47.113 --> 15:49.082
-What the hell
is going on in here?
-Nothing.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.585
I-I just think
you're killing it today.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.153
Now, you've gone along
with every one of my ideas.

15:53.187 --> 15:55.555
You haven't called me
a moron once.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.758
Wait a minute.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.328
You're doing all of this
'cause you feeling bad for me?

16:01.361 --> 16:02.962
This is a pity heist.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.932
You really think I'm that upset
about my ex-wife?

16:05.965 --> 16:09.336
-No?
-Look, I don't care
what Lorraine is doing

16:09.369 --> 16:10.970
and I don't care
who she's doing it with,

16:11.004 --> 16:13.173
and I don't care what her
mattress sounds like

16:13.207 --> 16:14.374
when they doing it.

16:14.408 --> 16:15.542
And for the record,

16:15.575 --> 16:17.811
it's... (squeaking)

16:20.680 --> 16:24.218
(sputters, squeaks, snores)

16:27.687 --> 16:30.857
Can we please just take the TV
and be done with it?

16:30.890 --> 16:32.859
You know what?
I don't want that TV now.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.362
You don't pity me, I pity you!
You take it.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.731
-Fine, I will.
-The hell you will.

16:37.764 --> 16:42.502
Get your hands off that.
That's my 65-inch TV set.

16:42.536 --> 16:44.371
You wouldn't even know
what to do with it.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.673
I would watch it.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.743
Well, you just have
an answer for everything.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.211
I got gas.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.249
Charlie, tell me the truth.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.916
Is this a pity heist?

16:56.950 --> 16:58.652
Oh, absolutely not. No.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.920
This heist is 'cause we all felt
really sorry for you

17:00.954 --> 17:03.056
and thought you might
need a win.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.725
That's a textbook pity heist.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.227
Well, whatever it is,
I got the laughing gas

17:07.261 --> 17:08.862
to cover our escape.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.830
There is no one to escape from.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.567
We do not need gas.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.236
So no ski masks, no gas.

17:16.270 --> 17:18.071
This heist sucks.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.173
-(gas hissing)
-If you're so worried

17:20.206 --> 17:21.775
about not being caught,

17:21.808 --> 17:23.910
why don't you try making
a little bit less noise,

17:23.943 --> 17:25.111
(laughing):
you dumbass.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.080
Why am I... why am I laughing?

17:27.113 --> 17:28.615
What is happening?

17:28.648 --> 17:31.551
(laughing):
The nozzle came off.

17:31.585 --> 17:33.186
Oh...

17:33.219 --> 17:36.923
I shouldn't have
knocked it over.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.458
-Why does everything we do...
-Shh.

17:38.492 --> 17:41.395
...always have to be
so damn stupid all the time?

17:41.428 --> 17:46.366
(laughs): Like, like,
my marriage. It's stupid.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.269
The truth is coming out.
Keep going.

17:49.303 --> 17:52.406
(laughing):
My-my soul mate cheated on me,

17:52.439 --> 17:55.409
and-and she left a gaping hole
where my heart should be.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.810
Yeah.

17:56.843 --> 18:00.947
And we thought we could
fill it with a TV.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.749
Now the devil woman
wants to marry

18:02.782 --> 18:05.319
the man she cheated on me with!

18:05.352 --> 18:09.956
That kind of pain
doesn't go away!

18:09.989 --> 18:13.627
I'm dead inside!

18:17.263 --> 18:20.133
(shouts, laughs)

18:20.166 --> 18:22.669
Damn, damn, damn!

18:22.702 --> 18:24.704
(all laughing)

18:32.346 --> 18:36.282
I can't believe you all thought
I needed this pity heist.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.251
Yeah, but don't you feel better
now that you've said

18:38.284 --> 18:40.854
all that stuff you were
holding deep inside?

18:40.887 --> 18:44.458
No. It was just the gas.
And the gas has passed.

18:46.025 --> 18:48.628
I'll bet Mr. Emotion Man
was excited to hear

18:48.662 --> 18:51.431
about your breakthrough when
you let him out of the sauna.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.967
Uh, right.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.137
"Let him out."
Um, I didn't do that.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.340
(clears throat)

19:02.876 --> 19:05.311
How'd you guys
get out of the sauna?

19:05.345 --> 19:08.448
We made it out when Mr. Randall
came in for his morning steam.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.517
Completely naked, by the way.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.653
Lowest testicles I've ever seen.

19:13.687 --> 19:15.321
Oh, I've seen lower.

19:15.355 --> 19:19.058
Happy ending to Allison's story:

19:19.092 --> 19:22.796
we made some serious
breakthroughs about her sister.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.698
Oh, that didn't happen.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.166
You kept crying because you
thought Beetlejuice was coming,

19:27.200 --> 19:28.835
and then you tried
to eat your fingers.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.872
I was tasting them, Allison,
tasting.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.676
And Hank.

19:36.710 --> 19:40.480
I spent most of my time in the
sauna planning to murder you.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.882
Then I realized
I sweated off ten pounds

19:42.916 --> 19:45.419
and I'm gonna be the hottest
bridesmaid at that wedding.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.921
Way hotter than my bitch sister.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.391
We've got some work
to do, still.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.729
Uh, can one of you escort me
to the infirmary?

19:55.762 --> 19:59.098
I haven't peed in 14 hours.

19:59.132 --> 20:00.767
I'll take you.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.270
Don't worry about the pee.
It'll come.

20:04.303 --> 20:07.707
I'm gonna go, uh, go help
Allison with her smoky eye.

20:07.741 --> 20:10.410
She, she really is pathetic,
isn't she?

20:10.444 --> 20:14.080
Yes, she is. And, uh, Margaret.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.049
-Mm.
-One last thing.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.684
What is it?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.318
Thank you.

20:20.954 --> 20:23.356
What exactly are you
thanking me for?

20:23.389 --> 20:27.126
Don't push me, Margaret.
That's as far as I'm going.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.596
All right, I'll take it.

20:29.629 --> 20:33.066
I'll see you later, you moron.

20:41.074 --> 20:44.644
It's movie night!

20:44.678 --> 20:49.716
Tonight's film
is 13 Going on 30.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.719
Now, I chose this film

20:52.752 --> 20:55.622
'cause it's an enchanting
romantic comedy

20:55.655 --> 20:59.826
and plus, it's still stuck
in the VCR part

20:59.859 --> 21:02.829
of my TV/VCR combo.

21:02.862 --> 21:08.401
So imagine this:
when the day begins, you're 13.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.404
But when the Moon comes up,
you're 30.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.974
She can't even drive a car.

21:15.008 --> 21:18.177
'Cause she looks 30
on the outside,

21:18.211 --> 21:21.681
but on the inside,

21:21.715 --> 21:24.017
she's 13.

21:24.050 --> 21:28.488
Y'all a bunch of wusses.

21:28.522 --> 21:30.524
That's pretty good.
