WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.399
What a night, y'all.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.836
I mean,
we snuck out to Belle Isle.

00:10.880 --> 00:14.014
Noah, like, nap-timed
the chaperones with his voice,

00:14.057 --> 00:15.841
and Mildred--
you floated Rev

00:15.885 --> 00:17.191
like a butterfly.[chuckles]

00:17.234 --> 00:18.888
I have never seen
such trippy stuff sober.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.456
You guys are like superheroes.

00:21.499 --> 00:22.848
Like, with your own origin
story and everything.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.024
I guess that makes me

00:24.067 --> 00:25.155
the Kardashian of the group.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.635
Like, bringing a dash

00:26.678 --> 00:28.289
of reality TV fame
to spice things up.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.247
What's a reality TV?

00:30.291 --> 00:31.292
What's a TV?

00:31.335 --> 00:33.381
TV is like radio you watch

00:33.424 --> 00:34.512
like talkies.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.645
And then reality TV is where

00:36.688 --> 00:37.689
you get, like, a bunch
of regular people

00:37.733 --> 00:39.387
with different personalities,

00:39.430 --> 00:41.867
and you film, like,
all the drama that unfolds.

00:41.911 --> 00:44.131
So, like, for example, so,
like, Shanice-- she's our rebel,

00:44.174 --> 00:45.610
so she clashes with Rev,

00:45.654 --> 00:47.351
the golden boy.
And then, Mildred,

00:47.395 --> 00:49.179
you and Hayden are, like,
the "will they, won't they."

00:49.223 --> 00:50.441
Will they, won't they what?

00:53.009 --> 00:54.793
[chuckles]
Just wait.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.099
So, then, what are you?

00:56.143 --> 00:57.405
Obviously, I'm the star.

00:57.448 --> 00:58.841
But nobody knows that

00:58.884 --> 01:00.060
because
I do not have cameras

01:00.103 --> 01:02.105
following me around anymore.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.629
God, I miss being famous.
[scoffs]

01:06.718 --> 01:08.503
Oh, my God, Mariah.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.287
Wh... What?

01:13.116 --> 01:14.596
But how did you
get in here?

01:14.639 --> 01:16.946
Does your father
know you're here?

01:16.989 --> 01:19.427
He wasn't gonna let me, but
I-I really wanted to see you.Okay,

01:19.470 --> 01:20.732
but...

01:20.776 --> 01:22.821
How? How are you here?

01:22.865 --> 01:25.041
Some guy. I-I think he said
his name was Hayden.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.042
He opened the door for me,

01:26.086 --> 01:27.652
and... I don't know.

01:27.696 --> 01:29.306
I guess I just...
I really wanted to meet you.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.961
And I didn't think much past...

01:32.004 --> 01:34.224
Making it happen? [chuckles]Yeah.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.879
Hotheaded runs in the family.Really? [chuckles]

01:38.533 --> 01:40.012
Wow.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.145
[chuckling]

01:42.189 --> 01:43.146
[chuckles]

01:43.190 --> 01:44.191
Oh, come here.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.629
[gasps]

01:48.543 --> 01:50.153
I love you so much, Mom.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.811
[gasps]

01:57.334 --> 01:58.379
What was that?

01:58.422 --> 02:00.555
What?I...

02:00.598 --> 02:02.470
I...

02:02.513 --> 02:04.124
You...

02:04.167 --> 02:06.213
Um, a-are you okay?

02:07.301 --> 02:09.346
Yeah. Yes, I just...

02:09.390 --> 02:10.956
I...

02:11.000 --> 02:13.220
I really need you to know,
t... to tell you

02:13.263 --> 02:14.786
that you were...

02:14.830 --> 02:18.312
You aremy world.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.836
I never would have left you
by choice.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.533
Okay.

02:22.577 --> 02:25.493
But Dad told me
you wrote a letter,

02:25.536 --> 02:27.495
so...No, I never wrote a letter.

02:27.538 --> 02:28.583
I...You never wrote the letter?

02:29.714 --> 02:31.238
Okay, well, okay, I did, but...

02:31.281 --> 02:33.327
So you just lied to me?No.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.067
It's not like that. I'm just...

02:35.111 --> 02:38.680
I'm-I'm just confused,
and I-I saw...

02:40.377 --> 02:43.206
You have this...
this Bridget person,

02:43.250 --> 02:44.903
and-and...Wow. Okay,

02:44.947 --> 02:46.557
what does Bridget have to do
with you leaving?

02:48.907 --> 02:51.345
I don't know
why I thought I could trust you.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.955
This was a mistake.No, M-Mariah.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.391
Wait. Please.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.350
Just...

03:03.270 --> 03:04.880
[protestors
shouting indistinctly]

03:07.622 --> 03:09.841
LADONNA:
This crowd has doubled
since last night.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.669
SHANICE:
I just hope
Mariah got home okay.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.629
But how did your
daughter get in?

03:14.672 --> 03:16.805
She said Hayden let her in.LADONNA: I guess that's why

03:16.848 --> 03:17.806
he didn't go to Belle Isle.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.548
He can see the future.

03:20.591 --> 03:22.245
No big deal.
[chuckles]

03:22.289 --> 03:23.725
Anyway,

03:23.768 --> 03:24.726
your daughter
sounds like a badass.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.075
It's probably not her first time

03:26.118 --> 03:27.381
sneaking back in at dawn.
[chuckles]

03:27.424 --> 03:29.513
ANDRE: Quite the hullabaloo.

03:29.557 --> 03:30.732
And all over us.This is

03:30.775 --> 03:32.603
all good for us, okay?

03:32.647 --> 03:35.650
No publicity is bad publicity
as far as we're concerned.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.218
It keeps us in the public eye
and out of the shadows.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.741
But the government

03:39.784 --> 03:40.916
is a different story.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.920
Steve said they're trying
to have some press event soon.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.704
They want all this to go away

03:46.748 --> 03:49.011
ASAP.You're on a first-name basis
with the guards?

03:49.054 --> 03:50.360
The papers will be here?

03:50.404 --> 03:52.057
Just Steve.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.711
And we don't really do
paper anymore,

03:53.755 --> 03:54.930
but yes, reporters.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.410
You seem an expert on the press.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.194
Being on camera
used to be my job.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.848
On celluloid film?

03:59.891 --> 04:02.807
[chuckles] Well,
it's digital now, but yeah.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.592
I was actually shooting
my own reality show when...

04:04.635 --> 04:06.637
this happened.ANDRE: Perhaps

04:06.681 --> 04:09.249
someone documented the
precise moment you were taken,

04:09.292 --> 04:11.425
then.I don't know.
It's all pretty blurry.

04:11.468 --> 04:14.297
I remember drinking a lot

04:14.341 --> 04:16.430
and then arriving on Belle Isle.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.345
I must have been really trashed.

04:18.388 --> 04:22.087
Um, I was shooting
my premiere episode.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.611
♪ I'm burnin' up,
come put me out ♪

04:23.654 --> 04:25.003
♪ Come and put me out

04:25.047 --> 04:26.266
♪ I'm burnin' up...

04:26.309 --> 04:28.703
This one.Oh, no.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.835
Your body would do nothing
for that dress.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.750
♪ Come put me out,
come and put me out... ♪

04:32.794 --> 04:34.796
[sighs] Have you thought more
about me getting my degree?

04:34.839 --> 04:36.928
I think it could be
kind of good for me.[laughs]

04:36.972 --> 04:39.757
Computer science. What a waste.

04:39.801 --> 04:42.325
You wouldn't even
have time, anyway.Dad thinks I can manage...

04:42.369 --> 04:43.892
Exactly why you know
that's a terrible idea.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.241
Look, being fabulous

04:45.285 --> 04:47.852
is your full-time job now.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.898
Fix your priorities.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.900
And fix your face.
You got a zit coming in.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.076
SHARON: Cut!

04:54.119 --> 04:56.034
[indistinct chatter]That was harsh, Mom.
Even for the cameras.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.994
[sighs] Uh-uh, that wasn't for
the cameras. I meant every word.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.952
You need to think
about your brand,

05:00.996 --> 05:02.040
not your brain.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.958
Hey.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.047
Don't worry about
your mom, okay?

05:09.091 --> 05:10.484
This is about you

05:10.527 --> 05:11.920
coming out
of the ex-wives franchise

05:11.963 --> 05:13.182
with your very own spin-off.

05:13.225 --> 05:16.403
You are our future,
right? Our star.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.452
You know what?
[chuckles softly]

05:22.496 --> 05:24.411
If they're gonna bring in
the press,

05:24.454 --> 05:27.065
I'm gonna make myself
the star this show needs.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.763
KEN: Hey!

05:28.806 --> 05:31.374
No loitering in the hallways.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.462
Get to breakfast.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.681
[mockingly]: Get to breakfast.

05:33.724 --> 05:36.118
[scoffs]

05:36.161 --> 05:38.686
HAYDEN: I wouldn't eat that.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.302
What is that?CORA: A mate in three puzzle.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.651
HAYDEN:
It's a way

05:47.695 --> 05:49.305
to play my favorite game
without a set.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.177
Chess.[squeals] Hayden.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.527
Mildred told me
it's your birthday

05:53.570 --> 05:54.963
tomorrow.
We are gonna party.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.704
How old will you be?[mouths]

05:58.227 --> 06:00.447
91.NOAH: Well, a party

06:00.490 --> 06:02.187
is something to, like,
actually look forward to,

06:02.231 --> 06:03.537
you know? We're
gonna make it sick.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.582
I don't know how or with what,

06:05.626 --> 06:08.455
but, by Gandalf, I'm excited.
[hums]

06:08.498 --> 06:09.934
[chuckles]

06:12.023 --> 06:14.852
Hey, Hay, was I not
supposed to say anything?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.506
Just don't like my birthday.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.465
There was-- I mean, is--

06:18.508 --> 06:21.293
never much to celebrate
when you're locked up.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.004
Your move, bro.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.355
[door opens]

06:39.399 --> 06:41.009
Yo, texpert.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.577
Hey. What's up, J?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.448
Okay, did anybody
pass through here last night

06:45.492 --> 06:47.058
when we were...No.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.017
I checked CCTV
soon as I got your text.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.628
Okay, but then
who drew this?

06:51.672 --> 06:52.760
And when?

06:52.803 --> 06:54.762
No idea.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.503
It's a mystery.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.243
On top of the mystery
of what happened at Belle Isle,

06:58.287 --> 07:00.681
well, twice.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.944
Wait, do you have a theory on
what put us to sleep out there?

07:02.987 --> 07:03.945
Working through
Keisha's body cam footage,

07:03.988 --> 07:05.599
but nothing yet.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.689
I should update her.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.865
It'd give us
a reason to talk.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.083
Hmm.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.042
[indistinct chatter]

07:17.524 --> 07:19.439
[door closes]

07:19.482 --> 07:22.050
KEISHA:
These are for you.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.447
JESSICA:Now that we're all
here, tomorrow,

07:27.490 --> 07:29.492
we're holding a press event

07:29.536 --> 07:31.842
to catch the public up
on the 4,400 situation

07:31.886 --> 07:33.453
and dispel any rumors

07:33.496 --> 07:34.802
that have been swirling
around them.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.499
Carla Coleman

07:36.543 --> 07:37.587
from the mayor's office
will be running the event.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.284
Carla.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.504
Thank you, Agent Tanner.

07:46.378 --> 07:49.381
Thanks to the leak,
which DHS is still working on,

07:49.425 --> 07:51.340
the public knows that
4,400 missing persons

07:51.383 --> 07:52.950
appeared on Belle Isle

07:52.994 --> 07:54.343
and are being detained.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.997
That is all they know.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.520
It's gonna be our job
to remind them of that

07:57.564 --> 07:59.391
by removing any space
for speculation.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.524
In your packets, you will see
approved statements,

08:01.568 --> 08:05.180
the reporters in attendance
and an outline of the event.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.834
Agent Tanner also tells me
a few of you

08:06.877 --> 08:08.183
will be tasked with finding

08:08.226 --> 08:09.924
an ambassador
among the 4,400.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.230
This is going to be key,
as the public needs

08:12.274 --> 08:13.754
to put a face to the situation.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.278
You want me and Jharrel
to find this person?

08:16.321 --> 08:18.585
Okay, look, my job is
to advocate for the residents,

08:18.628 --> 08:21.239
not to play ball
for some government spin job.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.937
None of the family members
have even been notified.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.766
The mayor believes the sooner
the public has answers,

08:25.809 --> 08:27.028
the sooner we can all focus

08:27.071 --> 08:29.117
on returning the 4,400

08:29.160 --> 08:31.554
to society
and moving on with our lives.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.947
JESSICA:
Everybody else, your job

08:32.990 --> 08:34.862
is to get this place cleaned up.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.603
We want the world to see
what a safe

08:36.646 --> 08:39.910
and welcoming environment
we have provided here.

08:39.954 --> 08:41.912
CARLA:
Sorry.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.784
[chuckles softly] I should have
given you a heads-up.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.525
I-I didn't...No, no.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.787
It's all good.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.311
How have you been?

08:49.354 --> 08:51.574
I'm good. And you?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.184
Actually, I was wondering,

08:53.228 --> 08:55.273
is... is Manny...

08:55.317 --> 08:58.015
I-I know the 4,400
are missing persons.No.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.104
Manny's not a 4,400.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.629
Not officially.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.326
What does that mean?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.503
Look at this.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.334
It's Manny's tag.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.729
Look, this appeared
last night.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.121
Only he could
have drawn this.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.296
This is a circle.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.515
No. No, this...

09:19.559 --> 09:20.908
It's his signature.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.474
Look, he draws a circle

09:22.518 --> 09:23.867
and the first number,
and then I come in

09:23.911 --> 09:24.825
with a second number,
and we take turns

09:24.868 --> 09:26.435
until there's 12, but...

09:26.478 --> 09:28.568
Look, I think he's here,

09:28.611 --> 09:29.917
and he's trying to
tell me something.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.658
Okay.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.182
So, Manny came back
with the other 4,400

09:34.225 --> 09:35.966
on Belle Isle,

09:36.010 --> 09:37.620
but instead of telling you
he's back,

09:37.664 --> 09:40.580
he's skulking around,
leaving cryptic drawings?

09:41.668 --> 09:42.669
This isn't like before.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.061
This is exactly like before.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.107
Manny went missing
and you got obsessed.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.326
You followed every lead,

09:48.370 --> 09:50.633
and then you made up leads
when those ran dry.

09:50.677 --> 09:54.202
Spent every night at his place
waiting for him to return.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.812
Never coming home.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.162
Carla, I'm sorry.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.164
All right, I know
I wasn't great

10:00.208 --> 10:02.123
back then, but...

10:03.820 --> 10:05.779
I'm not gonna give up on him.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.476
And wrecking your whole life,

10:07.519 --> 10:10.392
going on these
wild goose chases--

10:10.435 --> 10:11.611
you really think
that's what Manny

10:11.654 --> 10:12.829
would want for you, Jharrel?

10:12.873 --> 10:14.657
I mean,
you already lost one job.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.050
Well, I'm not losing this one.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.096
This job at this hotel

10:19.140 --> 10:20.315
is the only chance I have
of finding him.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.363
Good luck, Jharrel.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.714
[sighs]

10:28.802 --> 10:30.804
[sighs]Hey.

10:30.847 --> 10:34.285
There's my favorite
rebel social worker.

10:34.329 --> 10:38.159
FYI, you'll be doing
a tailored statement

10:38.202 --> 10:39.726
at the event tomorrow.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.771
[chuckles]The public likes social workers.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.817
And if I'd rather
jump off a cliff?

10:45.383 --> 10:47.559
Keisha thinks
you're a bleeding heart,

10:47.603 --> 10:49.779
but I think you just don't know
how to be a team player.Oh, I do.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.128
Just not when the game
is rigged.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.391
Look, I need this job,

10:53.435 --> 10:56.003
but I'm here to advocate,
not to be a puppet.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.526
The game has changed.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.833
If you want in,
here's your speech.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.573
Memorize it.

11:01.617 --> 11:04.098
Play ball, or you're out.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.851
Today, we are
interviewing residents

11:17.894 --> 11:20.592
to be potential
press ambassadors.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.290
JHARREL:
I think

11:22.333 --> 11:23.726
you might actually be great

11:23.770 --> 11:26.686
at the job.
And it could be fun.A job?

11:26.729 --> 11:27.861
Is this a paid position?

11:27.904 --> 11:30.037
No.[laughs]

11:30.080 --> 11:31.865
And how would you rate
your oration skills?

11:31.908 --> 11:33.867
Uh...

11:33.910 --> 11:35.433
Okay.

11:35.477 --> 11:38.436
Gonna take that
as below average.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.221
JHARREL:
So,

11:40.264 --> 11:41.439
how do you feel
about public speaking?

11:42.919 --> 11:44.573
[chuckles]

11:44.616 --> 11:45.835
Me too.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.315
No worries.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.187
What tactics would you use

11:50.231 --> 11:51.449
with an upset reporter?

11:51.493 --> 11:52.494
Michigan Penal Code.

11:52.537 --> 11:55.366
Article three...

11:55.410 --> 11:56.846
twenty-eight.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.022
A person who commits
unlawful imprisonment

11:59.066 --> 12:01.895
is guilty of a
felony punishable

12:01.938 --> 12:04.854
by imprisonment for
not more than 15 years

12:04.898 --> 12:07.422
or a fine
of not more than $20,000.

12:07.465 --> 12:08.989
Or both.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.251
[Claudette laughing]

12:10.294 --> 12:12.427
So, you want me,

12:12.470 --> 12:13.733
a Black woman being held

12:13.776 --> 12:15.256
against her will,

12:15.299 --> 12:16.779
to do all this
work for free?

12:16.823 --> 12:19.347
[laughs]
Fun.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.001
Oh, geez.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.568
Hmm.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.701
Did you have your interview

12:25.745 --> 12:26.833
for the papers?Nope.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.269
Wasn't asked.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.837
Doubt I have
the face they want.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.577
There does seem to be

12:32.621 --> 12:34.014
an air of baloney involved.

12:35.406 --> 12:36.712
But...

12:36.756 --> 12:38.932
when the reporters
are around,

12:38.975 --> 12:41.891
if you get nervous,
remember not to sing.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.937
It would be
extremely dangerous

12:43.980 --> 12:45.503
if your powers
made the front page.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.027
I can't always help it.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.289
Try?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.772
Is everything
all right, Noah?

12:52.815 --> 12:54.861
Where's
your usual joie de vivre?

12:55.992 --> 12:57.689
I-I don't love doctors.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.300
No offense.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.736
Mine haven't been
the most supportive humans

13:00.780 --> 13:02.303
in my life.I see.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.132
Is there anything
I can help you with?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.354
[paper rustles]

13:10.398 --> 13:12.313
I need this medicine.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.531
I haven't

13:13.575 --> 13:14.794

13:22.976 --> 13:25.282
I'm transgender.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.631
I need this

13:26.675 --> 13:27.981
to be my true self.

13:28.024 --> 13:32.072
Transgender?Yeah.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.988
When I was born,
they said I was a girl,

13:35.031 --> 13:37.904
but clearly, I-I'm not.
[chuckles]

13:38.992 --> 13:41.081
Do you hide this?

13:41.124 --> 13:43.126
It's no secret. I'm proud of it.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.432
I'm out to basically everyone.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.523
Well, this is all...

13:50.655 --> 13:52.875
...remarkable.[chuckles]

13:52.919 --> 13:54.746
Sorry, Doc.
Did I blow your mind? [chuckles]

13:54.790 --> 13:57.010
Well, you've...

13:58.533 --> 14:01.014
...certainly expanded
my vocabulary.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.711
Thank you for sharing.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.844
And you can count on me

14:04.887 --> 14:07.237
to procure
the medicine you need.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.196
Thanks.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.506
It is such a waste that
they're interviewing everyone

14:15.550 --> 14:18.901
for the press thing when there's
only one real option: me.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.598
You wantthis role?
[scoffs]

14:20.642 --> 14:21.991
Then why weren't you
interviewing

14:22.035 --> 14:23.384
with the rest of us?

14:23.427 --> 14:25.212
Well, I'm waiting
for them to finish

14:25.255 --> 14:27.779
and realize they have no one
so that when they truly need me,

14:27.823 --> 14:29.346
their desperation
will give me the leverage

14:29.390 --> 14:31.131
to get the most out of this.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.046
Oh, like get us
out of here?I'm getting my phone back.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.526
[sighs] You know they not
gonna let you say the truth.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.790

against our will.I mean, it's not that bad.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.667
for me to use my superpower:
my media skills.

Claudette.

15:02.771 --> 15:05.078
Glad I caught
you. I could use

15:05.121 --> 15:07.863
your insight
on how to throw a kids' party.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.126
You'd know better than me.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.781
You think that because
I'm a grown woman from my time

15:12.824 --> 15:14.348
that that's
what I'd know best?

15:15.697 --> 15:18.352
Mm.[chuckles]

15:18.395 --> 15:21.224
I didn't mean to offend her.But you did

15:21.268 --> 15:22.530
such a good job at it.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.017
[sighs]

15:37.153 --> 15:39.416
Thought I'd find you here.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.462
Did they audition you, too?

15:43.333 --> 15:45.292
Not yet.They're obviously

15:45.335 --> 15:47.555
gonna use this press event

15:47.598 --> 15:49.078
to screw us over even more.
[chuckles]

15:49.122 --> 15:50.862
Hmm?

15:51.863 --> 15:53.343
But...

15:53.387 --> 15:55.867
something else is on your mind.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.696
We need to get out
of this hotel.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.872
And soon. Noah's not
getting the treatment

16:00.916 --> 16:02.222
he needs,

16:02.265 --> 16:04.354
not to mention what the guard

16:04.398 --> 16:06.008
did to him the other day.
And if they find out

16:06.052 --> 16:07.140
about his voice,

16:07.183 --> 16:10.404
about all the... enhancements...

16:11.492 --> 16:12.972
I think I...

16:14.190 --> 16:17.280
When I hugged Mariah,
I saw something.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.848
I think it was

16:19.891 --> 16:22.111
a memory. Her memory.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.157
Oh.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.028
Oh.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.421
You believe you might
be experiencing

16:27.464 --> 16:29.727
an emergent ability

16:29.771 --> 16:31.555
akin to Noah?I don't know. I...

16:31.599 --> 16:34.428
I wish I wasn't. I don't want
to be afraid to hug her.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.212
Hmm.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.171
I believe

16:38.214 --> 16:41.174
that with patience and study,

16:41.217 --> 16:43.480
we can identify the boundaries

16:43.524 --> 16:45.047
of all these abilities.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.354
That may offer you
a sense of control.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.356
Yeah, but I'll be no better
at being a mom.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.053
I was so rattled

16:51.097 --> 16:54.143
by the vision
and afraid of losing her

16:54.187 --> 16:55.840
that I lied to her face.

Oh.

without practice.

17:03.718 --> 17:06.503
Go easy on yourself.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.984
And when you see her again,

17:09.028 --> 17:10.899
be honest.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.076
And if she never wants
to see me?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.643
I don't think that will happen.

I'm not interested in being

19:01.879 --> 19:03.577
your master of ceremonies.
What I need

19:03.620 --> 19:04.795
is medical texts,

19:04.839 --> 19:06.623

medical training.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.451
Just yesterday,

19:08.495 --> 19:11.237

of a medication I was unaware of

19:11.280 --> 19:13.326
that he lacks access to.

I would very much like your help
in acquiring it.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.289
Well, I will definitely
work on that.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.073
And on getting Noah the meds
he needs.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.604
So?

19:30.647 --> 19:33.084
You find anyone we could use
as our spokesperson?

19:33.128 --> 19:35.348
Anybody willing
and able? Nope.

[scoffs] Yeah,
this isn't that kind of thing.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.500

19:57.544 --> 19:59.285

and the public

19:59.328 --> 20:01.722

20:03.289 --> 20:05.595
What do you want?I want what you want.

20:05.639 --> 20:06.857
Good press.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.424

a very particular set

20:08.468 --> 20:10.992

memorization, improvisation

20:24.701 --> 20:26.268

confiscated it.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.836
It's pink
with a rhinestone case and...

20:30.664 --> 20:32.622
Wait, did-did you know
I was coming in here?

20:32.666 --> 20:34.537
What do you mean?

20:34.581 --> 20:35.843

There it is. Right there.

I can't, but Jessica can.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.686
I'll make the case
to her, okay?

20:52.729 --> 20:54.949
Best I can ask for
is supervised time once a week.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.864
Once a day.Twice a week.

Final offer.

Deal.
