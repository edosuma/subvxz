WEBVTT

00:05.370 --> 00:07.031
MAN: That's all that happened.
I was sitting over there,
minding my...

00:07.070 --> 00:08.332
Sir, all I'm
asking...

00:08.370 --> 00:09.667
all I'm asking...
I did nothing wrong.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.166
And I didn't say you
did anything wrong.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.235
There was no sign saying
I couldn't sit in that area.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.202
I just need to know what
the problem was back there.
The problem was I'm black.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.105
Hey, sir.
No, seriously,
all I was doing was

00:17.150 --> 00:18.401
I need you to
calm down.
sitting there
until it was time

00:18.450 --> 00:20.042
to pick up my wife
and kids.
Sir?

00:20.080 --> 00:21.445
MAN:
What's happening, buddy?

00:21.480 --> 00:23.539
Nothing, I've got to go
pick up my wife and kids.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.058
MAN: No, you're
under arrest.
What? _I-I didn't
do anything wrong.

00:26.090 --> 00:28.354
Put your hands
behind your back.
Please take
your hands off me.

00:28.390 --> 00:31.154
(all three talking
over each other)

00:31.190 --> 00:32.555
Put your hands
behind your back.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.420
Hey, I did nothing wrong,
all right?

00:34.460 --> 00:36.428
Don't make me
use this.
Oh, now you're
gonna shoot me?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.062
I said...
For what? For...

00:38.100 --> 00:41.069
(all three talking
over each other)

00:41.100 --> 00:42.761
(Taser buzzing)
No, don't do it.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.232
WOMAN: No!
(screams)

00:44.270 --> 00:46.636
No! Oh, my God!

00:46.680 --> 00:48.739
You're killing me.
Cole!

00:48.780 --> 00:50.748
NEWSCASTER: Tonight, a jury
continues to hear evidence

00:50.780 --> 00:53.078
about the death of Cole Willis.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.714
Willis' death at the hands
of two police officers,

00:55.750 --> 00:58.116
Michael and Trenton,
places Chicago

00:58.150 --> 01:01.608
on a growing list of cities
protesting racial injustice

01:01.660 --> 01:03.321
by local law enforcement.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.157
JOSH: You'll definitely
be asked about this.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.555
Are these two cops guilty
of, you know,

01:06.600 --> 01:08.352
involuntary
manslaughter?

01:08.400 --> 01:10.197
Well, I can't comment on it--
the trial's still going on.

01:10.230 --> 01:10.969
_ It's _not
still gomg on.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.297
I have a friend
in the courthouse.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.262
The judge just finished
jury instructions.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.165
Geez, talk about the luck.
ALICIA: Well, I still
can't comment on it.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.838
Uh, Prady won't have any problem
commenting on it-- he wants

01:18.870 --> 01:20.633
the black vote, he will
play up the, you know,
the blah-blah-blah.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.307
Here, let me take the jacket.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.147
Excuse me, can you do
this another time?
She goes on

01:24.180 --> 01:26.273
in 20 minutes. When do you
advise I take in the arms?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.742
If you want something to eat,
I can make you a sandwich.

01:27.780 --> 01:28.849
No, nothing to eat, it'll make
her want to throw up onstage.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.245
How about peanuts?

01:30.290 --> 01:31.439
No, now go away,
crazy lady!

01:31.490 --> 01:32.479
Okay, okay, okay, just listen.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.215
You show support
to the police,

01:34.260 --> 01:36.251
but you also argue the best way
to support the police...

01:36.290 --> 01:37.587
And let's lose the necklace.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.222
It's less fussy.
Why didn't you
do this before?

01:39.260 --> 01:40.352
I need to see
it on the body.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.494
Okay, we have 18 minutes to go,
let's hold it together.

01:43.530 --> 01:44.622
Josh, step away for a second.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.160
Me. I'm the only one
doing my job.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.361
Okay, take a breath.
Where's Jon?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.209
VVho?
Elfman.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.207
Oh, I don't know.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.707
He'll be here. Why?

01:52.740 --> 01:53.877
Never mind.

01:53.910 --> 01:55.434
Take a breath.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.607
Okay, the bad news is
you're six points down.

01:57.650 --> 02:00.369
The good news is this is
your chance to take it to him.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.910
Okay?

02:01.950 --> 02:03.178
Prady won't be
expecting it.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.346
We've lowered
expectations.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.482
So don't be afraid
to interrupt him.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.589
Tell him,
"That's not true!"

02:06.620 --> 02:07.712
She's eight
points down.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.284
She needs to
shake you.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.286
She'll interrupt you,
try to get you

02:12.830 --> 02:14.491
Right, just roll with the
punches, you're the frontrunner.

02:14.530 --> 02:16.498
Give off the air
of the frontrunner,

02:16.530 --> 02:18.168
she'll look desperate.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.337
He's a stickler
for rules.

02:19.370 --> 02:20.439
He'll complain
to the moderator,

02:20.470 --> 02:21.494
and that'll make him
look small.

02:21.540 --> 02:22.336
Uh-oh, you're
getting a call

02:22.370 --> 02:24.463
from work, a client.
No, not right now.

02:24.510 --> 02:25.738
What are you doing?
We're in countdown mode.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.533
She has to focus.
They say
it's important.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.831
Okay, just take a message,
I'll call them back.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.904
It's Neil Gross.

02:29.950 --> 02:30.905
Uh-oh.
No.
Oh.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.178
I have to take it.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.175
He's our biggest client.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.517
Just give me a second.
Alicia!

02:34.550 --> 02:35.949
ALICIA:
What's the problem, Mr. Gross?

02:35.980 --> 02:37.641
Yeah,
they're saying $30 million.

02:37.690 --> 02:38.941
$30 million.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.514
I thought I said no higher
than $15 million.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.959
Uh, you did say $15 million.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.480
Who's saying $30 million?

02:43.530 --> 02:44.679
I don't know, some guy,
your lawyer.

02:44.730 --> 02:46.322
I don't even know who he is.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.520
Um, Evan?
Oh, Evan.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.528
Yeah, he's a...
he's a good lawyer.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.629
Yeah, well, you need
to protect me-- I have a prenup.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.558
I don't know why I'm paying
an arm and a leg.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.534
Just so you know, Alicia,
I'm thinking about leaving.

02:55.570 --> 02:56.798
Oh, don't do that, Mr. Gross.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.569
Why? You're running for office.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.976
I don't even... I don't even
recognize these people.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.274
Come on, get your clothes
on.
Okay, let me look into it,
and I'll get back to you.

03:03.310 --> 03:04.470
Good.

03:04.510 --> 03:05.602
I'm unhappy.

03:05.650 --> 03:06.947
Let's put this down here,
we don't want

03:06.980 --> 03:08.277
to make it look like
you're trying too hard.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.446
There's been
a last-minute change--

03:09.490 --> 03:10.445
we need to show
you something.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.445
All right, I just need a second.

03:11.490 --> 03:12.411
Alicia, it's eight minutes

03:12.460 --> 03:14.280
until you go on.
And they changed
the clock.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.958
You know, the, uh, the, um,
you know, countdown thing.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.457
It's digital now.
Okay, I'll tell her,

03:17.490 --> 03:18.525
I'll tell her.
I need you to see it...

03:18.560 --> 03:21.324
Can I have Diane
or Cary, please?
It's digital now.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.568
Ah, thank you,
thank you so much.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.331
I have to confess, I feel
like I'm 60 years older.

03:28.370 --> 03:29.735
But I've missed
this,
WOMAN: Diane?

03:29.770 --> 03:30.759
I miss just-just
being,

03:30.810 --> 03:31.799
talking about
something

03:31.840 --> 03:33.808
other than going to prison.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.535
Um, but, uh,
yeah, it's been...

03:35.580 --> 03:36.649
It's Alicia.
I'm back now

03:36.680 --> 03:37.408
and I'm ready
to pitch in,

03:37.450 --> 03:38.576
so whatever
you guys need, just...

03:38.610 --> 03:40.316
Alicia, how are you?

03:40.350 --> 03:42.545
I think you're going on
in about two minutes.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.649
Yes, um, look, I just got
a call from Neil Gross.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.248
He's very upset about
his divorce settlement.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.281
He called you? Why?

03:48.320 --> 03:50.652
He said that Evan
is offering $30 million

03:50.690 --> 03:52.294
and he's threatening
to leave the firm.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.592
Well, this is a surprise to me.

03:53.630 --> 03:55.655
We agreed to go no higher
than $15 million.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.997
I know.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.793
There could be a chance
that Evan is freelancing.

03:58.830 --> 04:01.469
Look, I have to go on,
could you take care of it?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.728
Uh, yes. Good luck, kick ass.

04:02.770 --> 04:03.805
Kalinda, do you
have a minute?

04:03.840 --> 04:05.398
One second.
CARY:
What's wrong?

04:05.440 --> 04:06.805
I think you may
need to suit up

04:06.840 --> 04:08.330
soonerthan
you expected.

04:08.380 --> 04:10.007
My client is ruined, sir.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.506
GROSS:
She's not "ruined."

04:11.550 --> 04:12.744
She has the house
in Brentwood,

04:12.780 --> 04:13.974
the apartment in
San Francisco.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.443
Emotionally ruined,
scarred, distraught.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.980
WOMAN: You slept with my best
friend, I can't believe it.

04:18.020 --> 04:19.578
You slept with
my competitor.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.383
That was a pre-existing
relationship.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.728
GROSS: Which you
then renewed.
Where are we,
Evan?

04:22.760 --> 04:25.627
We're agreeing on an amount.

04:25.660 --> 04:26.888
And we said $30 million
isn't enough.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.727
$30 million? How did
we get to $30 million?

04:28.760 --> 04:30.022
We didn't get
to $30 million,

04:30.070 --> 04:31.992
your lawyer offered
$30 million, and we said

04:32.030 --> 04:33.463
that wasn't enough.
Why did you offer
$30 million?

04:33.500 --> 04:34.762
I'll show you why.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.062
Photos.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.829
You may want to avert
your eyes, dear.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.441
This is you, Mr. Gross,
in bed with your ski instructor.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.778
That's why your new head
of family law,

04:45.810 --> 04:48.643
the one you promoted
after I left,

04:48.680 --> 04:49.647
offered $30 million
to settle.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.386
Because these photos will not
look good on TMZ.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.615
CARY:
That's intimidation, Mr. Lee.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.855
A class three felony.
Yes, if I indeed
threatened you,

04:56.890 --> 04:58.881
but I did not.
I just know

04:58.930 --> 05:03.094
how salacious photos tend
to find their way onto the Web.

05:03.130 --> 05:05.394
Evan's always been our
toughest negotiator.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.398
I don't understand.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.668
What changed?

05:08.700 --> 05:10.668
Did David Lee hire
Evan originally?

05:10.710 --> 05:12.678
You think he's intimidated
by his old boss?

05:12.710 --> 05:14.337
I think he might be.
No.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.972
Could you give
me a half hour?

05:16.010 --> 05:17.739
CARY: Why?
What's going on?

05:17.780 --> 05:19.645
I think that David Lee is
offering him a job,

05:19.680 --> 05:22.342
but Evan's too afraid to bite
the hand that will feed him.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.711
(sighs) Okay, so we put
a pause in the negotiation,

05:24.750 --> 05:27.355
see if we should
replace Evan.

05:27.390 --> 05:28.516
What?

05:28.560 --> 05:29.720
I've missed this.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.058
All _the usual
disasters.

05:32.090 --> 05:33.557
WOMAN:
Do you want some water?

05:33.600 --> 05:34.828
You should hydrate.

05:34.860 --> 05:38.523
(everybody talking
over each other)

05:38.570 --> 05:40.834
MA_N:
HI.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.600
Chris Matthews. I am so
glad to be doing this.

05:43.640 --> 05:44.868
Oh, hello,
I'm so glad you could.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.537
With you two running
for state's attorney,

05:46.580 --> 05:47.706
how could I not?

05:47.740 --> 05:48.729
I'll see you
out there.

05:48.780 --> 05:50.748
ALICIA:
See you out there.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.077
Okay, I know, three minutes
till you're on.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.668
Here are the key
points again.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.675
Okay, wait, wait,
we've got a problem.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.449
I just got a call
from one of the reporters,

05:56.490 --> 05:57.514
and we got to think fast.

05:57.550 --> 05:59.552
Which one?
Patrick Mancini.

05:59.590 --> 06:00.352
With the, um,
Middeleton Herald.

06:00.390 --> 06:01.755
He's the one
on the end right there.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.825
ELI:
He's a real jackass.

06:02.860 --> 06:03.827
What does he want?

06:03.860 --> 06:05.748
He's, uh...

06:05.790 --> 06:07.997
got photos of the governor
with Ramona Lytton.

06:08.030 --> 06:09.827
Leaving her apartment.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.996
From when? When
were they taken?

06:11.030 --> 06:12.531
Uh, two days ago.

06:12.570 --> 06:13.992
He plans on making that
his first question.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.598
Eli, what is going on?

06:15.640 --> 06:16.834
I thought he
broke it off.

06:16.870 --> 06:18.838
Yeah, stuck it in
and broke it off.

06:18.870 --> 06:20.929
Okay, let's not jump
to conclusions.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.743
I will talk to him,
but in the meantime,

06:22.780 --> 06:23.974
I wouldn't rise
to the bait.

06:24.010 --> 06:24.840
How do we not
rise to the bait?

06:24.880 --> 06:25.744
He's got the whole
thing documented.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.645
Let my office deal
with this-- defer to us.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.749
We've got three minutes.
(cell phone buzzes)

06:28.780 --> 06:29.940
Uh, Alicia,
you're getting a call.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.719
No, not now.
Uh, from the governor.

06:31.750 --> 06:32.819
Don't take it.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.986
He probably got a call
from Mancini, too.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.556
There is nothing
you can say right now

06:35.590 --> 06:36.784
that'll make this
any easrer.
Just try and relax.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.786
ALICIA: I'm away
from my phone at the moment,

06:38.830 --> 06:40.798
so please leave a message.

06:40.830 --> 06:41.990
Are you ready,
Mr. Governor?

06:42.030 --> 06:43.520
Yes, I am, Pastor.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.128
And I want_t_o thank
you for InVItIng me.

06:45.170 --> 06:48.890
No, it's best if we can all
talk with one voice.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.465
Yes.
NEWSCASTER: The fate
of Officers Michael and Trenton

06:51.510 --> 06:53.501
are now in the hands of a jury.

06:53.540 --> 06:54.734
(cell phone rings)

06:54.780 --> 06:56.099
Um, can you just
give me one second?

06:56.140 --> 06:58.005
Eli, where are you?

06:58.050 --> 06:59.039
_ ELI:
ComIng to you.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.919
Don't answer any questions
about Ramona.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.918
They have photos
of the two of you.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.554
From when?

07:06.590 --> 07:08.182
Two nights ago.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.029
Have they asked Alicia about it?

07:10.060 --> 07:11.789
Not yet, but they
may in the debate.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.025
Just don't answer any calls,
let me work on this for a while.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.596
(cell phone buzzes)
It's Bill Duncan.

07:15.630 --> 07:17.598
Oh, great, it's reached
full saturation.

07:17.630 --> 07:19.598
Mr. Governor,
I'll be there in a minute.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.789
Bill, hey.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.229
What are you hearing
about the verdict?

07:23.270 --> 07:24.862
What?

07:24.910 --> 07:26.832
No.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.678
Are you serious? We are on
the verge of a race riot.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.871
And you're asking me about
the governor's sex life?!
Race riot?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.775
Really?
Shh.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.242
No, I will not
dignify that.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.248
Just call me again
when you get serious.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.246
Yep, black people.

07:39.290 --> 07:41.258
Just can't help
themselves, can they?

07:41.290 --> 07:42.621
I'm not saying
you'll riot.

07:42.660 --> 07:43.820
Oh, thanks.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.487
Well, you're not like other...

07:46.560 --> 07:47.788
...people.
What other people?

07:47.830 --> 07:49.149
Black people?
No.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.599
What, am I not
black enough?

07:50.630 --> 07:51.995
No... y-yes...

07:56.570 --> 07:58.231
You're more suburban.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.636
Why am I even here?

08:00.680 --> 08:02.705
_ What?
Hi, you never want me
out of the ofﬁce.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.808
Tonight?

08:03.850 --> 08:05.704
You wanted me
WIth you.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.775
Hmm?
I thought it was just
a perk of the job.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.014
(scoffs)
Okay.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.881
Well, I'm your black
shield tonight, okay?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.888
(cell phone buzzes)
It's Roger Hailman.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.514
Yeah, he's my friend
at the courthouse.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.528
Uh-huh.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.824
Roger, hey, what's up?

08:19.860 --> 08:21.851
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.595
We go live in 90 seconds.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.166
JOSH: You can't defer
to governor's office.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.736
That's like throwing
the "you know" to the sharks.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.533
I agree, but what
does she say?

08:28.570 --> 08:31.209
All marriages have their, uh,
their blah-blahs, their trials.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.572
That's acknowledging the
premise of the question.

08:33.610 --> 08:34.804
He slept with prostitutes.
I think the premise has
been acknowledged.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.899
"What_ does this have to do with
my job as state's attorney?"

08:36.950 --> 08:38.599
How is that not accepting
the premise of the question?

08:38.650 --> 08:39.617
Questioning
the question.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.174
Okay, guys, guys.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.040
I am gonna say it's
none of their business.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.046
JOSH: It is their business, and
that'll make you look defensive.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.285
Say Peter and you have
to trust each other.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.287
No, she'll look
like a doormat.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.287
Can you let me finish?
Uh-oh.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.287
What?
Dad just texted me.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.285
He can't get ahold of you.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.558
The last one we want to hear

08:52.600 --> 08:53.555
from right now is the governor.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.589
No, the jury is coming in.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.052
What, wait, what?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.091
MARISSA: The Cole Willis jury
is coming in right now.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.589
They just went out,
are you kidding me?

09:01.640 --> 09:03.267
They deliberated
for ten minutes.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.562
JOSH: Well, we need a response,
they're gonna ask... See, look.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.032
(cell phone buzzes)
Okay, if they find
the cops guilty...

09:07.080 --> 09:08.934
They're not gonna find
the cops guilty.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.902
Not after ten
minutes of blah-ing.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.214
If the verdict comes back
not gurlty, then we have
to make a comment.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.047
No, it's too early-- we don't
know where this is going yet.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.719
I'm not saying she has to come
out pro-cop or anti-cop...

09:17.750 --> 09:20.355
(Josh and Johnny talking
over each other)

09:20.390 --> 09:22.950
Shh.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.925
Guys, guys.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.325
Okay, thanks.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.896
Shh.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.329
MATTHEWS: Good evening,
and welcome to the debate

09:30.370 --> 09:32.326
for Cook County
State's Attorney,

09:32.370 --> 09:34.588
coming to you from the ballroom
of the Bonaventure Hotel.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.039
Remember, in terms
of the affair,

09:36.070 --> 09:36.707
the charges are
unsubstantiated.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.332
And you want
to handle it

09:38.370 --> 09:39.906
within the sanctity
of your marriage.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.305
And don't get provocative
with the jury verdict.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.046
That could go
either way.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.139
Don't be thrown by the countdown
clock--- it's, uh, digital.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.716
Blinks green when you
have ten seconds left.
Green? Why does it blink green?

09:46.750 --> 09:47.910
Why not red?
I don't know.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.372
To screw with us.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.944
Oh, and meet Prady halfway
across the stage

09:50.990 --> 09:52.617
to shake his hand.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.878
Your mic is live, so say,
"Good to see you, Frank."

09:54.920 --> 09:56.012
You got it?
What?

09:56.060 --> 09:57.084
You got it?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.382
"Good to see
you, Frank."

09:59.430 --> 10:01.955
MATTHEWS: And now I'd like
to introduce the two candidates,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.060
Alicia Florrick
and Frank Prady.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.762
JOSH: Good luck,
you'll be great.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.066
Good to see you again, Alicia.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.236
Good to see you, too, Frank.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.946
MATTHEWS: There are limits
on the applause later,

10:20.980 --> 10:25.041
but for now, why don't we
all give them a big hand?

10:25.090 --> 10:27.081
(applause)

10:52.410 --> 10:54.446
"Take thou away from me
the noise of thy songs,

10:54.480 --> 10:58.211
"for I will not hear
the melody of thy viols.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.879
"But let justice roll down
as waters

11:01.920 --> 11:04.855
and righteousness
as a mighty stream."

11:04.890 --> 11:06.892
Now, that's why we're here.

11:06.930 --> 11:09.797
Not for the sweet words
of flattery,

11:09.830 --> 11:13.266
but for justice, peace.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.062
You can't get ahold of him?

11:16.100 --> 11:17.738
What do you mean,
you can't get ahold of him?

11:17.770 --> 11:20.034
ELI:
The mayor is in New Hampshire.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.243
You're kidding.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.872
It's not a bad thing.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.049
Looks like rank selfishness
on his part.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.877
Yes, except we're trying to stop
a riot from happening here.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.218
...interrupt the debate...
All right, get me his
chief of staff.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.888
I have her on
hold right now.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.218
So what? He's taking
a run for president?

11:35.260 --> 11:36.727
Well...

11:36.760 --> 11:37.454
WOMAN:
Eli! Sorry to keep you waiting.

11:37.490 --> 11:39.128
This must be about the verdict.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.320
Yes. The governor is worried

11:40.360 --> 11:41.896
about the mayor
being indisposed.

11:41.930 --> 11:43.989
Okay, well, tell him
not to worry, Eli.

11:44.030 --> 11:46.169
The mayor and I have been on
the phone for the last hour.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.428
Really?
How'd he do that?

11:47.470 --> 11:49.290
I've been watching him
on a live feed

11:49.340 --> 11:51.331
at a fund-raiser in Concord.

11:51.370 --> 11:54.874
Are you and I gonna
have trouble tonight, Eli?

11:54.910 --> 11:56.400
Not unless this explodes on us.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.305
Okay, it won't explode.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.079
The mayor canceled
all furloughs,

12:00.120 --> 12:01.747
we have 800 extra officers
on the street,

12:01.780 --> 12:03.384
in riot gear, with tear gas.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.411
They're going full Ferguson
on this, sir.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.055
FRANNY:
Oh, come on, Eli, this is hardly
an equivalent situation.

12:08.090 --> 12:09.489
PETER:
Put me on with her.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.953
Hold on.

12:10.990 --> 12:12.218
PETER:
Hello, Franny.

12:12.260 --> 12:13.921
Listen to me.
Can you hear me?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.154
Uh, yes, Mr. Governor.
How are you this evening?

12:15.200 --> 12:16.895
PETER:
I'm fine.

12:16.930 --> 12:18.466
I'm at the interdenominational
conference downtown

12:18.500 --> 12:20.365
and I need you to get your ass
down here right now,

12:20.400 --> 12:23.062
or I'm gonna drag the mayor
through the mud.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.998
I'm sorry, I'm not sure
what mud you're talking about.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.508
You know damn well
what mud I'm talking about.

12:27.540 --> 12:30.145
Now, I gave the mayor
early warning on this verdict,

12:30.180 --> 12:32.842
and he's still sitting
on his ass in New Hampshire,

12:32.880 --> 12:34.370
thinking he can sit this out
and blame me.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.819
Well, you can tell him

12:35.850 --> 12:37.112
that I'm the one in front

12:37.150 --> 12:38.412
of the cameras
with the megaphone.

12:38.450 --> 12:39.485
You have to understand,

12:39.520 --> 12:40.487
there were no flights,
so it's...

12:40.520 --> 12:42.283
(call cuts off)

12:42.320 --> 12:45.118
Wow.
All right, let's go.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.025
MATTHEWS:
Questions will be asked
of both candidates

12:47.060 --> 12:48.823
on a rotating basis,

12:48.860 --> 12:51.420
with the first candidate
given 45 seconds to respond,

12:51.470 --> 12:53.938
the second candidate,
30 seconds of rebuttal.

12:53.970 --> 12:57.098
If that rebuttal mentions
the other candidate by name,

12:57.140 --> 13:00.234
that candidate will have
20 seconds to respond.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.044
Both candidates will also have
ten seconds to ask the other

13:03.080 --> 13:04.377
a direct question.

13:04.410 --> 13:06.002
Unless, of course,

13:06.050 --> 13:09.542
the candidate has exceeded
his or her time,

13:09.580 --> 13:11.081
and then, that candidate
will have the option

13:11.120 --> 13:13.486
of adding to their time,
but only by subtracting it

13:13.520 --> 13:16.284
from their closing arguments.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.379
There will also be a lightning
round in which both candidates

13:18.430 --> 13:19.556
will have ten seconds
to respond.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.091
Mr. Prady, you have 15 seconds.

13:21.130 --> 13:23.189
PRADY:
I come in with a clean slate.

13:23.230 --> 13:25.494
I have no
bureaucratic grudges.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.259
Nothing to prove.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.528
All I see

13:28.570 --> 13:30.231
is a city that
needs a new way,

13:30.270 --> 13:32.067
and I want to
be that new way.

13:32.110 --> 13:33.805
MATTHEWS:
Mrs. Florrick.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.306
I hear that a lot.

13:39.350 --> 13:42.569
A new way, a new approach
to crime on our streets.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.985
But no matter what,

13:44.020 --> 13:45.612
whenever I vote
for that person,

13:45.650 --> 13:48.289
we end up
right where we started.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.424
We end up with...

13:50.460 --> 13:54.624
um, uh, the murder rate
continually climbing.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.969
We end up...

13:57.000 --> 13:58.592
In short, inexperience is not a
value. It is something to be...

13:58.630 --> 14:00.063
MATTHEWS:
Mrs. Florrick, your time is up.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.965
Mr. Prady, in about ten minutes

14:02.000 --> 14:03.433
we'll have a verdict in the
Cole WIIIIS manslaughter case.

14:03.470 --> 14:05.358
Do you have a comment
on that trial?

14:05.410 --> 14:07.901
PRADY:
Well, Chris, uh, I will
in about ten minutes.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.601
For now, all I can say
is I think we have

14:09.640 --> 14:11.540
to take a look
at police traInIng.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.218
ELI:
Why is she frowning?

14:13.250 --> 14:14.911
You have her frowning.
Well, this is all new to her.

14:14.950 --> 14:16.884
Give her a second.
No, you prepped her wrong.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.547
You got... I got to go.

14:18.590 --> 14:20.979
Yeah, Eli, I just got off
the phone with the mayor.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.487
We're not gonna leave
the police exposed.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.487
No one said they'll be exposed.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.929
But they go in with riot gear,

14:24.960 --> 14:26.359
they'll create a riot.

14:26.390 --> 14:27.618
That's what happened
in Ferguson.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.457
Okay, but with all due
respect to the governor,

14:29.500 --> 14:31.161
we're deferring to
the police on this.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.497
No, no, no.
You're playing politics

14:34.700 --> 14:36.634
Okay, and you want the
African-American support, sir.

14:36.670 --> 14:39.161
No one's winning
a Nobel Peace Prize here.

14:39.210 --> 14:40.507
No one wins if there's a riot.
Pastor!

14:40.540 --> 14:41.632
Come on, let's not play

14:41.680 --> 14:43.443
dueling pastors here.
Pastor Jeremiah,

14:43.480 --> 14:45.175
I believe you know
the mayor's chief of staff.

14:45.210 --> 14:46.438
Yes, I do. Good evening.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.175
Good evening.
She believes the police

14:48.220 --> 14:49.573
should be ready
with riot gear and tear gas.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.383
Uh, that would be
a terrible mistake.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.081
I mean, the people want
to see justice done,

14:53.120 --> 14:54.553
but they will protest

14:54.590 --> 14:56.512
peaceably unless
they are provoked.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.356
ELI:
Franny?

14:57.390 --> 14:58.687
The mayor goes in
like storm troopers,

14:58.730 --> 15:00.652
he'll be blamed.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.497
PRADY:
That attitude is contagious.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.623
It diffuses a situation.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.194
And it's all cyclical.

15:06.230 --> 15:08.369
How's she doing?
I can't tell.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.459
There's some bad
body language there.
Take a look at police training.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.034
MATTHEWS:
And your time is up, Mr. Prady.

15:12.070 --> 15:13.503
Lightning round.

15:13.540 --> 15:14.575
Do you believe the police
were at fault

15:14.610 --> 15:16.168
in Ferguson, Mrs. Florrick?

15:16.210 --> 15:17.199
(clears her throat)

15:17.250 --> 15:19.206
Well, I'm not sure...

15:19.250 --> 15:20.376
Actually, it's
the lightning round.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.614
You only have five seconds.

15:22.650 --> 15:24.948
It's complicated.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.639
Mr. Prady?
It's a systemic problem.

15:26.690 --> 15:29.011
Good. Next question.
Talk to us about

15:29.060 --> 15:30.982
race relations in Chicago,
Mrs. Florrick.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.624
You've got 45 seconds.

15:33.660 --> 15:36.220
(knocks)
Hi.
It's, uh, a work in progress.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.329
You found out
something about Evan?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.167
He's working with David Lee?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.532
No.
Then why is he caving?

15:41.570 --> 15:44.539
His son was undergoing surgery
to remove histiocytosis tumors

15:44.570 --> 15:46.970
at the Lurie
Children's Hospital today.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.568
Did you know that?
No.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.168
The operation was successful.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.973
He just found out an hour ago.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.568
Well, I'm glad.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.315
_ But_...
Yes, It was just before

15:55.350 --> 15:57.409
he made the $30 million
settlement offer.

15:57.450 --> 15:59.179
He's become nice.

15:59.220 --> 16:00.653
CARY:
Uh-oh. We should send him home.

16:00.690 --> 16:02.055
DIANE:
No.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.626
We could open ourselves
to a malpractice suit

16:03.660 --> 16:04.752
from Neil Gross.

16:04.790 --> 16:06.485
CARY:
Then, we step in.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.622
DIANE:
Yes.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.548
Supply the backbone.
Kalinda, did you

16:09.600 --> 16:11.693
do any background work
on Mrs. Gross

16:11.730 --> 16:13.664
before their marriage?
Yes.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.338
And afterwards.

16:15.370 --> 16:18.100
Freelance work for David Lee?
Yes.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.562
He wanted to see
if she was cheating on him.

16:19.610 --> 16:23.046
Is there anything
interesting there?

16:24.180 --> 16:26.102
Yes.

16:26.150 --> 16:27.344
Photos.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.111
Good. Poetic justice.

16:31.150 --> 16:33.584
Using David Lee's work
against him.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.156
(applause on television)

16:35.190 --> 16:36.259
MATTHEWS:
Mrs. Florrick?

16:36.290 --> 16:38.178
You have ten seconds to respond.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.481
Uh, crime is crime.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.293
Black and white
shouldn't matter.

16:41.330 --> 16:44.322
It often does,
but that shouldn't prevent

16:44.370 --> 16:45.598
the state's attorney from...
Your time is up.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.597
But why don't you

16:46.630 --> 16:48.530
finish that sentence?

16:48.570 --> 16:50.629
...doing my job.

16:50.670 --> 16:51.807
Good. Now, let's turn
to our journalists.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.330
First up, Patrick Mancini

16:53.380 --> 16:54.631
from The Middeleton Herald.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.635
Do you have a question?

16:55.680 --> 16:57.147
I do. Thank you.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.705
Mrs. Florrick,
your husband has not

16:59.750 --> 17:01.775
always been faithful
to you in your marriage.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.811
In 2009 he, in
fact, resigned from

17:03.850 --> 17:06.648
the office you're now seeking
partly because he was caught

17:06.690 --> 17:08.555
in a sexual scandal...
I'm gonna Interrupt you
right there, Mr. Mancini.

17:08.590 --> 17:10.729
Actually,
I'm not finished, ma'am.
Yes.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.387
But you already called
my campaign manager

17:12.430 --> 17:14.398
with your question,
so I'm going

17:14.430 --> 17:15.590
to save you the trouble.
Oh, my God.

17:15.630 --> 17:17.188
What is she doing?
You have photos

17:17.230 --> 17:19.391
of my husband supposedly
at the apartment

17:19.430 --> 17:20.738
of his legal counsel--
is that correct?

17:20.770 --> 17:22.192
I wish you'd just let me
answer my question,

17:22.240 --> 17:23.605
Mrs. Florrick... _
I mean, ask my question,

17:23.640 --> 17:25.369
Mrs. Florrick... _
My daughter is In the audience

17:25.410 --> 17:27.799
tonight, sir,
and I would like to do her

17:27.840 --> 17:29.728
the favor of addressing your
question, not answering it.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.475
Holy...
Ow, stop!

17:31.510 --> 17:32.807
This is how

17:32.850 --> 17:33.748
I would answer your question,

17:33.780 --> 17:36.248
Mr. Mancini.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.713
How dare you, sir?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.411
Do you have
a personal life?

17:39.450 --> 17:41.486
Do you have a spouse?

17:41.520 --> 17:42.851
Do you know
what it would be like

17:42.890 --> 17:45.654
to have
your personal life spilled

17:45.690 --> 17:47.123
across the stage like this?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.593
Broadcasted

17:48.630 --> 17:50.393
into the homes of your friends,
your workmates,

17:50.430 --> 17:52.762
your daughter's
friends at school?

17:52.800 --> 17:54.336
Do you know
what that would be like?
Ma'am, I'm only reporting...

17:54.370 --> 17:55.689
It would be one thing if my job

17:55.740 --> 17:57.731
had anything to do with
my husband's infidelity.

17:57.770 --> 17:59.806
I'm not even sure
what job that would be.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.729
But your question would
at least then be pertinent.

18:02.780 --> 18:04.668
But I'm running
for state's attorney.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.871
I am running
to be someone to put

18:06.910 --> 18:08.844
a dent in crime in this town.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.519
What does that have to do
with my married life?

18:11.550 --> 18:13.757
That was terrific.

18:13.790 --> 18:16.679
Uh-oh. She's brought
her own pastor.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.429
ALICIA: ...about my husband's
alleged infidelity would.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.257
All right, I'll deal with that.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.723
Why don't you make sure
the police don't overreact?

18:24.770 --> 18:26.726
ALICIA:
Because it's the only story...
This is gonna be fine.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.567
Gonna be fine.
MATTHEWS:
Actually, Mrs. Florrick...

18:28.600 --> 18:29.862
I know that I am past my time.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.208
But let me just finish up.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.435
We are real people up here.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.175
Mr. Prady and myself.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.575
We're not cartoons.

18:36.610 --> 18:39.704
When you hurt us,
we actually do bleed.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.718
I know that that is hard
for you to remember,

18:41.750 --> 18:44.514
Mr. Mancini,
but it is worth trying.

18:44.550 --> 18:47.383
If not for me,
then for my daughter.

18:47.420 --> 18:49.581
I, um...

18:49.620 --> 18:51.520
Yes, thank you. Mr. Prady?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.255
Do you have a response?
I never finished my question.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.791
MATTHEWS:
Sure, if you want
to finish your question.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.889
MANCINI:
I'm breaking a story tomorrow

18:57.930 --> 18:59.363
about the governor sleeping
with his legal counsel.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.662
(crowd booing)

19:00.700 --> 19:01.792
I didn't create the story.

19:01.840 --> 19:02.761
I'm just reporting on it.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.801
Why don't I turn to Frank Prady?

19:03.840 --> 19:05.705
Uh, 15 seconds.

19:05.740 --> 19:06.809
Do you have a rebuttal?

19:06.840 --> 19:07.829
Uh, I don't have a rebuttal, no.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.438
But I, uh, I will say this.

19:09.480 --> 19:12.278
I think Mrs. Florrick
deserves an apology

19:12.310 --> 19:13.868
from the press.
(crowd cheering)

19:18.590 --> 19:20.808
Ah, my own handiwork.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.657
What are you talking about?

19:22.690 --> 19:24.328
David had you followed when he
was representing your spouse.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.622
That's why your prenup is void.

19:25.660 --> 19:26.649
Isn't that right, Evan?

19:26.690 --> 19:28.794
Yes, it is.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.388
David,

19:30.430 --> 19:32.295
$15 million is as high as we go.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.730
No. I'll keep these.

19:34.770 --> 19:36.897
We have the originals, David.

19:36.940 --> 19:38.407
Good. Keep them.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.476
These are good enough for TMZ.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.330
Not that I'll give it to them.
I'm not sure you're getting

19:42.380 --> 19:44.678
this, David-- your
client broke her vows.
Yes.

19:44.710 --> 19:46.678
By sleeping with Mr. Gross'
biggest competitor.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.814
That'll look good for you,
won't it, Mr. Gross?

19:48.850 --> 19:51.512
Your wife prefers
SleuthWay over Chumhum?
Amazing.

19:51.550 --> 19:53.552
Just amazing.

19:53.590 --> 19:56.309
Half my life is about
lawyers these days, and just

19:56.360 --> 19:57.918
when I think
I have reached bottom,

19:57.960 --> 19:59.427
the ninth circle of hell,

19:59.460 --> 20:02.258
there is always a circle lower.

20:04.930 --> 20:06.522
(door opens)

20:06.570 --> 20:07.969
(door closes)

20:08.000 --> 20:09.865
After he calms down,

20:09.900 --> 20:11.868
tell him we'll settle
for $100 million.

20:11.910 --> 20:15.676
You have three hours
or we're out of here.

20:15.710 --> 20:16.699
Governor Florrick.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.776
Pastor.

20:18.810 --> 20:20.971
Hello, Father.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.238
Son.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.917
FRANNY:
Mr. Governor,
Pastor Isaiah believes

20:24.950 --> 20:26.542
the mayor's plan

20:26.590 --> 20:28.387
is the best way to handle
any possible violence.

20:28.420 --> 20:29.318
Really?

20:29.360 --> 20:30.759
Is that what you believe?

20:30.790 --> 20:32.826
I just know about
a deal between you

20:32.860 --> 20:35.522
and my father.
(stammers)
What deal?

20:35.560 --> 20:39.428
An $80,000 religious study?

20:39.470 --> 20:40.960
And I think it will be
evident to those upset

20:41.000 --> 20:43.309
by the verdict
that they're being misled.

20:43.340 --> 20:44.364
Why do you hate me so much, son?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.968
I don't hate you, Father.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.535
I just believe you're
being misled by politics.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.775
It's your mother, isn't it?
She put you up to this.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.448
Okay, the mayor's plan has been
implemented, Mr. Governor.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.777
He asks that you assist
in his efforts

20:53.820 --> 20:55.811
by not withholding
the National Guard reserves.

20:55.850 --> 20:57.317
Well, this isn't good.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.443
The verdict is in.
Oh, crap.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.913
I'm calling the mayor.
Get out the National Guard.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.724
Franny, if the mayor goes in
with this warrior stance,

21:04.760 --> 21:06.352
there's going to be violence.
MATTHEWS:
Mr. Prady?

21:06.390 --> 21:08.927
The point is, drug arrests
have been on the rise

21:08.960 --> 21:11.064
for years now and the sentencing
guidelines are crazily wrong.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.169
I'm sorry.
Time's up, Mr. Prady.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.760
Mrs. Florrick, you have
ten seconds for a rebuttal.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.360
Yes, well, talking
about guidelines,

21:17.410 --> 21:18.729
if there were guidelines
that we...

21:18.770 --> 21:19.839
I'm sorry again.
One second.

21:19.870 --> 21:21.679
Excuse me.

21:21.710 --> 21:23.598
(indistinct chatter)

21:23.650 --> 21:26.744
Our live feed
has been interrupted.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.042
Uh, what the hell?
Damn it.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.547
She was just getting
into a rhythm.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.582
We're being asked
to take a pause here.

21:31.620 --> 21:34.953
The Cole Willis verdict is in.

21:34.990 --> 21:37.424
And we're switching over
to live coverage.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.781
Uh, the hope is that in one
or two hours, they'll switch

21:39.830 --> 21:41.627
back to the debate.

21:41.660 --> 21:43.924
Stay tuned.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.767
Great job. You're kicking ass.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.461
Way to neutralize the sex stuff.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.637
Do you want some water?
No, where's the food?

21:48.670 --> 21:49.864
I'm starving.
In the hotel kitchen.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.505
You want me to make you a plate?

21:54.610 --> 21:56.976
You're doing great, Mom.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.877
The verdict is in,
and the two police officers

22:02.920 --> 22:05.809
who killed suspected gang member
Cole Willis

22:05.850 --> 22:08.353
during a routine arrest
were found innocent

22:08.390 --> 22:09.550
of all charges.

22:09.590 --> 22:10.887
Suspected gang member.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.557
Really? The suburban
father of two?

22:12.590 --> 22:14.490
Okay, let's not get upset.

22:14.530 --> 22:16.122
Why? You afraid
I'm gonna riot?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.491
Nora.

22:17.530 --> 22:19.395
This is your
Giuliani moment, sir.

22:19.430 --> 22:20.692
Careers are built
on moments like...

22:20.740 --> 22:22.958
Eli.
I'm not saying you take
advantage of it,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.558
but no one will talk
about Ramona

22:24.610 --> 22:26.737
if you handle this properly.
Eli, you need to stop.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.042
(door opens)

22:40.090 --> 22:42.012
PRADY: Oh, good,
I'm starved.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.925
(chuckles) Did they tell you
not to eat, too?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.427
Yes.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.428
So, how do you think
it's going?

22:47.460 --> 22:50.429
Oh, I don't know.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.688
Every time I get started,
they say, "Time's up."

22:52.730 --> 22:54.766
You had a good answer
to that one reporter.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.166
You were good
with the racial question.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.509
It's all artificial, isn't it?

23:00.710 --> 23:02.507
We agree on more
than we don't.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.679
(chuckles)

23:04.710 --> 23:06.177
We should debate now.

23:06.210 --> 23:09.509
See if we disagree
on anything.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.715
Our handlers won't be happy.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.828
Okay, you start.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.865
ALICIA: It helps no one
to throw the baby out

23:32.910 --> 23:33.831
with the bath water.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.474
The system need to be tweaked,
not overhauled.

23:36.510 --> 23:37.704
You really believe that?

23:37.750 --> 23:39.047
I do.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.843
We're on the verge
of another Ferguson...

23:40.880 --> 23:43.713
No, no, no, that was just
about jury selection.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.547
The prosecution screwed up
on voir dire.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.182
That's why those two cops
were found not guilty.

23:47.220 --> 23:48.858
No, they were found not guilty
because the system

23:48.890 --> 23:51.222
is inherently racist.
Ask anyone.

23:51.260 --> 23:53.899
So what do you do then?
If the system is racist,

23:53.930 --> 23:55.852
what is the state's attorney
supposed...?
You start with hiring.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.664
The racial diversity
in the office is a joke.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.760
How many white prosecutors...
No, but the exact opposite
needs to be done.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.609
It needs_to be
a pure meritocracy.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.198
No cronyism.
To consider race?

24:05.240 --> 24:06.730
That's not cronyism.

24:06.770 --> 24:08.499
Yes, it is.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.770
We need good prosecutors.

24:10.810 --> 24:13.199
There are a dozen
defense attorneys I know

24:13.250 --> 24:14.877
making $400,000 a year

24:14.920 --> 24:17.946
that would jump at the chance
to put criminals away.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.981
They're sick of what
they're doing now and...

24:20.020 --> 24:21.885
W-Why don't they?

24:21.920 --> 24:23.626
What?
You said they'd jump

24:23.660 --> 24:24.922
at the chance
to be a prosecutor.

24:24.960 --> 24:25.927
Well, what's stopping them?

24:25.960 --> 24:27.825
Well, what's stopping them

24:27.860 --> 24:29.259
is_that the office
is poorly run.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.790
They know they're gonna spend
half their time

24:30.830 --> 24:31.990
dealing with
a stupid bureaucracy.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.930
No, no, they don't jump

24:33.970 --> 24:35.631
because it's easier to talk

24:35.670 --> 24:37.535
about doing good than it is
to actually do good.

24:37.570 --> 24:40.164
(laughs)
And you call me cynical?

24:40.210 --> 24:42.531
Chicago is on the verge
of another Ferguson,

24:42.580 --> 24:44.639
because the system is all white.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.978
Because African-Americans
don't see someone

24:47.010 --> 24:48.546
who shares their experience.

24:48.580 --> 24:49.911
MAN:
You know what's really stupid?

24:49.950 --> 24:51.986
You're two white people arguing

24:52.020 --> 24:53.783
about why black people
are rioting.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.685
That's what's stupid.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.859
And you're saying there needs to
be more black people in office,

24:57.890 --> 25:00.893
and that's why we need
two more white people running.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.891
Okay.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.697
So what do you do?

25:07.740 --> 25:09.890
Stop prosecuting
so many drug crimes.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.532
That's exactly my plan
for office.
Exactly!

25:11.570 --> 25:12.901
That's why you
should vote for me.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.168
They put a guy in prison

25:14.210 --> 25:16.098
for killing a dog
just last week.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.949
Then these two cops kill
a black man,

25:17.980 --> 25:19.277
and what happens?

25:19.310 --> 25:21.175
They go free?
We should go there.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.245
Now.
What?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.747
Pastor Isaiah, would you like
to come with me?

25:24.790 --> 25:26.610
Where you going?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.015
There._
...to express their outrage

25:28.060 --> 25:29.209
over the innocent verdict...

25:29.260 --> 25:30.887
Are you serious?

25:30.930 --> 25:32.181
Yes.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.892
Yes, let's go.

25:34.930 --> 25:36.795
...where hundreds
of people protesting

25:36.830 --> 25:38.889
the Cole Willis verdict
have begun gathering

25:38.930 --> 25:40.932
outside the city courthouse.

25:40.970 --> 25:42.961
I'm gonna have trouble
getting home tonight.
You might as well

25:43.000 --> 25:44.206
start home now.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.867
You want these photos on TMZ?
We do.

25:45.910 --> 25:48.606
I don't bluff, Diane.
You know I don't.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.949
I don't, either.
What's this?

25:50.980 --> 25:53.244
Deena's employment contract
as in-house counsel

25:53.280 --> 25:55.077
at Chumhum.
Evan, what's going on?

25:55.120 --> 25:56.678
There's a standard
non-compete clause

25:56.720 --> 25:59.587
in the contracts.
Oh, come on.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.850
DIANE: Deena was sleeping
with the CEO of Chumhum's

26:01.890 --> 26:04.358
greatest competitor during
the time of that contract.

26:04.390 --> 26:07.154
If you ask me, that violates
her non-compete.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.896
That opens her up to a suit.

26:08.930 --> 26:10.898
God, you guys are terrible.

26:10.930 --> 26:12.591
Evan, do you agree

26:12.630 --> 26:13.961
with these kind of tactics?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.831
I'm sorry, David.

26:15.870 --> 26:17.599
Yes, we're all sorry.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.130
$15 million.

26:19.170 --> 26:22.879
You have an hour to accept
or it goes away.

26:22.910 --> 26:24.172
ALICIA:
My law partner, Cary Agos,

26:24.210 --> 26:26.599
was prosecuted on trumped-up
drug charges,

26:26.650 --> 26:27.844
so I understand this issue.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.211
Yeah, and he had
all the advantages

26:29.250 --> 26:31.343
of a white
entitled businessman.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.881
He's a lawyer, he knew lavwers,

26:33.920 --> 26:35.717
and he knew
how to work the system,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.057
but you take any
African-American up

26:37.090 --> 26:38.352
on drug charges...
Alicia. Here you are.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.187
Why don't we head back
to the greenroom?

26:40.230 --> 26:41.390
No, I'll meet you there.
No, I think

26:41.430 --> 26:43.193
we should go together.
Hey, let them talk.

26:43.230 --> 26:45.721
She said she'd
see you later. So what?

26:45.770 --> 26:47.635
You would just stop
prosecuting all drug crime?

26:47.670 --> 26:49.399
No, nonviolent drug crimes.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.964
I would de-emphasize them.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.329
You can just do that?
I can,

26:52.370 --> 26:53.632
but I'm not sure Alicia can.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.635
Why is that?

26:54.680 --> 26:56.079
Politics.

26:56.110 --> 26:57.407
I believe she'd want

26:57.440 --> 26:59.078
to de-emphasize drug crimes,

26:59.110 --> 27:00.714
but her critics would suggest

27:00.750 --> 27:02.843
she was doing this
as a favor to her old client,

27:02.880 --> 27:04.108
Lemond Bishop,

27:04.150 --> 27:05.082
a top drug dealer.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.246
And they would be wrong.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.882
Which wouldn't matter.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.785
The politics would
work against her

27:09.820 --> 27:11.287
relaxing drug prosecutions.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.957
But I don't have
any history here.

27:12.990 --> 27:15.788
I am free and clear to act.

27:15.830 --> 27:17.422
Okay, folks,
I think we're done here.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.667
Why would you want to stop
prosecuting drug crimes?
I can barely

27:19.700 --> 27:21.861
walk home at night with all
the dealers on my street.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.663
'Cause it's mostly
putting blacks in prison.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.359
Yeah, well, maybe they
should be in prison.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.332
Excuse me, why is this
all about black people?

27:27.370 --> 27:29.031
Most of the trouble
I have in my neighborhood

27:29.080 --> 27:30.672
is because of the blacks.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.109
Okay, wait, wait, what?

27:32.150 --> 27:33.344
I'm just telling you what
happens in my neighborhood.

27:33.380 --> 27:34.677
No, you're spouting

27:34.720 --> 27:35.914
racist bull.
That's not

27:35.950 --> 27:37.019
what I'm doing.
Actually, you know what, man?

27:37.050 --> 27:38.745
there's no taping in here.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.212
Uh, it's a proprietary issue
with the hotel.

27:40.250 --> 27:43.686
(sirens wailing)

27:47.260 --> 27:49.296
How have you been, Pastor?

27:49.330 --> 27:52.128
I'm well.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.195
I see that you have been, too.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.231
I have.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.237
It's been a while.

28:00.270 --> 28:02.135
It has.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.238
How are you and Alicia?

28:04.450 --> 28:06.338
Fine.

28:07.780 --> 28:08.769
No.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.983
No, you haven't been.

28:12.020 --> 28:15.114
Well, life's...

28:15.160 --> 28:17.151
complicated.
(scoffs)

28:17.190 --> 28:19.181
It is.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.128
Still believe?

28:24.800 --> 28:26.199
Do I believe in God?

28:28.340 --> 28:30.331
At times.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.132
You still pray?

28:35.840 --> 28:37.842
No.

28:40.210 --> 28:42.474
Do you want me to pray for you?

28:42.520 --> 28:46.513
I don't know what
I'd have you pray for.

28:46.550 --> 28:49.155
That you be a good man.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.151
Do you want to be good?

28:55.200 --> 28:58.795
I think it's
a little late for that.

28:58.830 --> 29:01.936
I want to be...

29:01.970 --> 29:03.961
effective.

29:05.140 --> 29:07.779
Does one discount the other?

29:07.810 --> 29:10.529
It can.

29:10.580 --> 29:12.775
Tonight, for example...

29:15.080 --> 29:17.787
...I need to be effective.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.315
Pray for that.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.079
Okay, then what do you do?

29:26.130 --> 29:28.098
You talk about equality,

29:28.130 --> 29:29.290
you talk
about overcoming racism.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.266
No, that's the poetry.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.291
That makes people feel good
when you say it, but that is not

29:34.340 --> 29:36.991
the S.A.'s job, and it wouldn't
make a bit of a difference.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.234
That's cynicism talking.

29:38.270 --> 29:40.261
No, that's a defense attorney
talking,

29:40.310 --> 29:44.007
saying that I have
seen firsthand what
prosecutors do wrong.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.142
And I know how to correct it.

29:45.180 --> 29:46.579
That's why I'll be
better at it than you.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.146
You're not... _
Because I'm not trying

29:48.180 --> 29:49.147
to remake the world.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.284
I don't think
I can change people.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.140
I think I can
change the office.

29:53.190 --> 29:55.158
You know what, go ahead
and shoot whatever you want.

29:55.190 --> 29:57.078
I can put defense
attorneys in office

29:57.120 --> 29:58.485
who are hungry to
put criminals away.

29:58.530 --> 30:02.159
I can go after the top crooks
because I know who they are.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.121
Because you represented them.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.297
Yes!

30:04.330 --> 30:06.298
And I know how they work.

30:06.330 --> 30:08.139
I'm not going in, hoping
for pie in the sky.

30:08.170 --> 30:10.035
We've had enough pretty words.

30:10.070 --> 30:12.459
We've had enough of novices
who talk a good game

30:12.510 --> 30:14.933
but then throw their hands up
when they realize

30:14.980 --> 30:16.129
they can't stop racism.

30:16.180 --> 30:18.000
They can't make everyone good.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.143
That's why people
should vote for me and not you.

30:20.180 --> 30:21.477
(applause)

30:23.650 --> 30:25.584
Frank!

30:25.620 --> 30:27.349
Let's go.

30:27.390 --> 30:28.459
Now. You're eight points up.

30:28.490 --> 30:29.855
Don't squander it.

30:29.890 --> 30:31.027
Oh.
We can get a photo.

30:31.060 --> 30:32.084
Ready? One, two, three.

30:38.230 --> 30:41.597
A black man who did everything
he was supposed to do.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.392
He went to the hospital.
What did they do?

30:43.440 --> 30:45.362
They sent him home
with some aspirin.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.162
Everybody white got cured.

30:47.210 --> 30:50.008
Just the black guy they
sent home with some pills.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.406
(protesters singing)
(siren chirps)

30:52.450 --> 30:53.405
Let's go.

30:53.450 --> 30:55.418
(indistinct shouting)

31:03.420 --> 31:04.978
George, how are you?

31:05.030 --> 31:06.383
So you lucked out, Eli.
What are you talking about?

31:06.430 --> 31:07.897
The governor is sleeping
with his lawyer,

31:07.930 --> 31:09.420
and what's the_ headline?
A race not?

31:09.460 --> 31:11.098
How dare you, George?
The governor is facing

31:11.130 --> 31:12.222
one of the biggest challenges
of his life.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.259
Am I quoting you now?

31:13.300 --> 31:14.392
No, just background.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.896
And you're obsessing

31:15.940 --> 31:17.430
about some stupid,
unsubstantiated sideshow?

31:17.470 --> 31:19.267
Okay, okay, so what do you
want me to quote?

31:19.310 --> 31:22.074
Well, the governor is pulling
up right now. I want you to...

31:22.110 --> 31:24.101
...to look over there

31:24.150 --> 31:26.243
and I will bring
the governor to you.
Why? What's going on?

31:26.280 --> 31:27.474
Do you want access, George?

31:27.510 --> 31:29.046
Then go over there.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.383
What are you doing here?

31:33.420 --> 31:34.409
Are you insane?

31:34.460 --> 31:36.212
The governor asked for me.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.285
Have you seen the news?
No one's reporting it.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.423
Because I've been killing
myself trying to keep it

31:40.460 --> 31:42.257
out of the news.
If they see you here...
It's my job, Eli.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.426
The governor wants to discuss

31:43.460 --> 31:44.597
the legal implications
of closing down

31:44.630 --> 31:45.927
the nearest cell tower.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.460
No, no, there are so many things

31:47.500 --> 31:48.432
wrong with that sentence.

31:48.470 --> 31:50.199
Just go home.
Hey, Ramona.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.605
You got a minute?

31:51.640 --> 31:53.267
Peter, no, you can't
be seen with her.

31:53.310 --> 31:54.607
That'll bring Ramona back
into the news.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.200
Just need ten minutes,
that's all.

31:57.240 --> 31:58.571
Can you give me
ten minutes, Pastor?

31:58.610 --> 32:00.100
Sure, Peter,
take the time you need.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.314
(car door closing)

32:05.490 --> 32:06.639
Dear God.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.157
Are you all right, Eli?

32:09.320 --> 32:11.356
No.

32:11.390 --> 32:13.381
I'm not.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.398
I just realize
that I work very hard,

32:15.430 --> 32:16.658
and I am not appreciated.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.520
You want to talk about it?

32:20.270 --> 32:22.067
Okay, we're back
in about ten minutes.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.204
What's going on out there?

32:24.240 --> 32:25.537
Any violence?

32:25.570 --> 32:27.401
Some sporadic.
Nothing cohesive yet.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.429
Yeah, nothing visual.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.368
The news is getting bored.

32:30.410 --> 32:31.502
That's why they're cutting
back to the debate.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.040
You'll get more
samplers than usual,

32:33.080 --> 32:34.308
so keep up the pressure.

32:34.350 --> 32:35.510
Yeah, and although
it was unorthodox,

32:35.550 --> 32:36.972
your extracurricular debate
with Prady

32:37.020 --> 32:38.317
has got his people
really scared.

32:38.350 --> 32:39.988
Yeah, so just keep up
the pressure.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.385
Yeah, I'm thinking
of voting for you now.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.012
That's how good you were.
Great.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.425
I need to talk
to Jon alone for a minute.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.194
You weren't gonna
vote for her before?

32:49.230 --> 32:50.254
No, I'm not a big voter.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.291
I'm in my 205.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.062
Alicia, I'm not sure
it's such a good idea...

32:57.100 --> 32:59.159
Wait. Listen.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.404
It didn't mean anything.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.635
What?

33:04.050 --> 33:06.644
In the parking garage?

33:06.680 --> 33:08.170
I was in a mood.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.142
It didn't mean anything.

33:10.180 --> 33:11.545
Yeah.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.444
Jon, you can look at me.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.515
It's fine. It's fine, really.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.328
It's a version
of transference.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.622
You know, sometimes candidates
or their wives,

33:19.660 --> 33:22.493
they, uh, they develop feelings
of affection for their handlers.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.088
It's not...
Okay, let's not do that.

33:24.130 --> 33:25.495
Okay.

33:25.530 --> 33:27.293
You don't need to instruct me
about my feelings.

33:27.330 --> 33:28.467
Sorry. (chuckles)

33:28.500 --> 33:30.365
That's how I deal with things.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.107
It's, uh, it's whatever.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.471
(laughs)

33:34.510 --> 33:36.501
You still can't look at me,
can you?

33:36.540 --> 33:37.802
(clears throat)

33:37.840 --> 33:40.638
Look at me.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.046
I don't have feelings for you.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.479
We're good.

33:44.520 --> 33:47.409
It just... happened.

33:59.870 --> 34:01.394
I...
What?

34:01.440 --> 34:03.431
STAGE MANAGER:
House lights at half.

34:03.470 --> 34:05.301
MATTHEWS:
We've got a problem.

34:05.340 --> 34:06.534
What's-what's wrong?

34:06.570 --> 34:08.435
We're calling
the debate off tonight.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.606
Really? Why?

34:09.640 --> 34:11.403
Frank Prady. He wants to delay.

34:11.450 --> 34:12.405
Did he say why?

34:12.450 --> 34:15.374
Tonight is not a night
for political posturing

34:15.420 --> 34:17.638
and 30-second canned responses
to questions

34:17.680 --> 34:19.716
about racial stratification.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.480
Tonight is a night for action.

34:22.520 --> 34:23.487
By action,
you mean running away?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.681
That is why I am asking
my opponent to join me

34:25.730 --> 34:27.425
in taking to the streets.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.553
Now is the time to listen.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.295
So, is it the time to listen
or the time for action?

34:31.330 --> 34:33.093
Jackass,
get your story straight.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.563
This is perfect;
he just made a mistake.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.465
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.104
You're gonna get out there...
Get out where?

34:38.140 --> 34:39.232
At your podium, and you're gonna
tell the reporters

34:39.270 --> 34:40.669
you're ready to debate.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.871
We get a photo op with you
standing at your podium

34:42.910 --> 34:44.275
facing no one.

34:44.310 --> 34:45.447
"I paid for this mic."

34:45.480 --> 34:46.378
Here's the thing, Alicia.

34:46.410 --> 34:47.672
This is the turning point
of the campaign.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.779
They just made a mistake.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.549
Yeah, that's something
Americans understand. Cowardice.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.548
The dog ate my...
uh, blah-blah.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.353
You ready? Can you do it?

34:54.390 --> 34:56.688
Let's go.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.529
No, I'm coming there now.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.788
It's an irritant.

34:59.830 --> 35:01.195
We can handle it.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.390
Okay.

35:02.430 --> 35:04.421
What happened, Neil?

35:04.470 --> 35:07.564
Deena used her knowledge
with the Chumhum board.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.158
Knowledge of what?

35:09.200 --> 35:10.690
The Fappening.

35:10.740 --> 35:11.638
What? What is that?

35:11.670 --> 35:12.830
CARY:
It's naked photos

35:12.870 --> 35:14.804
of celebrities hacked online.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.229
Yes, my ex-wife called the board
and accuses me

35:17.280 --> 35:18.702
of not doing enough
to stop the hacking.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.706
Leaves us open to a suit.

35:20.750 --> 35:21.739
In what way "open"?

35:21.780 --> 35:23.270
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.742
You're fired.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.587
I'm sorry, what?

35:26.620 --> 35:27.746
You're fired.

35:27.790 --> 35:29.382
You needed to close this
down immediately.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.557
You didn't.

35:30.590 --> 35:32.581
Now I have to settle
for $75 million.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.598
You cost me $60 million.

35:35.460 --> 35:36.529
I'm done.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.926
Mr. Gross, no other firm
could've done anything else.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.221
You know what, Cary, save it.

35:40.270 --> 35:41.396
Your attorney screwed up.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.668
David Lee took advantage of you.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.531
That is why I'm stuck
where I am.

35:44.570 --> 35:46.629
I don't like losing $60 million.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.433
I especially don't
like losing it

35:48.480 --> 35:50.436
to a wife who cheated on me.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.698
You need to get
your act together.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.542
That was unfortunate.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.319
It was.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.158
You know what we need to do.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.521
I think I do.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.551
(whistling)

36:13.000 --> 36:14.695
Well, hello.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.328
You want to offer me
more than $100 million?

36:18.370 --> 36:20.361
No.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.673
We know you're not happy
with Canning.

36:24.710 --> 36:27.747
He's sick, and you've been
carrying all the weight.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.975
Well, well.

36:30.020 --> 36:33.410
Kalinda's really been
working overtime for you.

36:33.450 --> 36:35.452
We want you back, David.

36:42.830 --> 36:44.366
(laughs)

36:48.370 --> 36:51.601
I guess you just can't quit me,
can you?

36:51.640 --> 36:53.767
What do you want, David?

36:59.580 --> 37:00.877
PROTESTERS: We get no justice,
you get no peace.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.719
We get no justice,
you get no peace.

37:02.750 --> 37:06.481
We get no justice, you get
no peace.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.717
Eli, we need to talk now.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.682
Yeah, I know.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.879
PROTESTERS:
...you get no peace.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.454
We get no justice,

37:14.500 --> 37:16.422
you get no peace.
Black lives matter!

37:16.460 --> 37:18.667
Black lives
matter!

37:18.700 --> 37:20.622
Black lives matter!

37:20.670 --> 37:23.468
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

37:23.500 --> 37:25.331
Black lives matter!

37:25.370 --> 37:27.759
Black lives
matter!

37:27.810 --> 37:29.732
Black lives matter!

37:29.780 --> 37:31.748
Black lives
matter!

37:31.780 --> 37:33.645
Ramona, I need you
to not talk to anyone.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.513
I know how it works, Eli.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.948
What happened?

37:38.990 --> 37:41.686
He said good-bye.

37:43.620 --> 37:44.928
So that's it.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.951
Good-bye.

37:49.660 --> 37:51.423
Good-bye, Ramona.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.461
PROTESTERS:
Black lives matter!

37:53.500 --> 37:54.728
Did you have any luck, Pastor?

37:54.770 --> 37:56.988
She's here.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.635
PROTESTERS:
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

38:01.880 --> 38:04.405
It's good to meet you, Deidre.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.010
I'm sorry about the death
of your husband.

38:07.050 --> 38:09.041
Thank you.

38:09.080 --> 38:12.709
I think we all want
the same thing.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.685
PROTESTERS: We get no justice,
you get no peace!

38:15.720 --> 38:17.051
The mayor's on his way
from the airport.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.728
Good. Good for him.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.057
Eli, he's asking that you hold

38:20.090 --> 38:21.591
the press conference
for 20 minutes.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.892
Franny, this is not
a press conference.

38:22.930 --> 38:24.795
This is an urgent need
to stop a riot.

38:24.830 --> 38:26.525
No, it's not. No one's rioting.

38:26.570 --> 38:27.923
You're trying to
take advantage...
Seriously.

38:27.970 --> 38:30.438
The governor is stepping in
for an absentee mayor

38:30.470 --> 38:31.698
in the city's time of need.

38:31.740 --> 38:32.809
You don't want to make an enemy.

38:33.810 --> 38:36.938
No, y don't.

38:36.980 --> 38:39.574
PROTESTERS:
Cole! Cole! Cole!

38:39.610 --> 38:41.771
Cole! Cole! Cole!

38:41.820 --> 38:44.709
Cole! Cole! Cole! Cole!

38:44.750 --> 38:46.843
Cole! Cole! Cole!

38:46.890 --> 38:49.916
Cole! Cole! Cole! Cole!

38:49.960 --> 38:51.951
Cole! Cole! Cole!

38:51.990 --> 38:55.096
Cole! Cole! Cole! Cole!

38:55.130 --> 38:57.690
Cole! Cole! Cole!

38:57.730 --> 39:00.563
Cole! Cole! Cole! Cole!

39:00.600 --> 39:04.434
Cole! Cole! Cole!

39:04.470 --> 39:05.801
Thank you.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.762
(indistinct shouting)

39:07.810 --> 39:11.029
I'm sorry that we have to meet
under such circumstances,

39:11.080 --> 39:13.378
but I wanted you to hear

39:13.410 --> 39:15.913
from the person
who should be the angriest

39:15.950 --> 39:17.770
at tonight's events.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.549
Deidre.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.059
Hi.

39:25.090 --> 39:28.890
Cole was a good man.

39:28.930 --> 39:31.569
If he were here right now,

39:31.600 --> 39:35.434
he'd be saying
what I'm saying to you now.

39:35.470 --> 39:39.099
This is not the time
to break things.

39:39.140 --> 39:43.008
This is the time to fix them.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.042
(shouting continues)

39:47.580 --> 39:49.468
Tonight,

39:49.520 --> 39:51.784
we are not black or white,

39:51.820 --> 39:54.687
rich or poor...

39:55.990 --> 39:57.753
REPORTER:
That is Governor Florrick

39:57.790 --> 39:59.189
speaking from the
Cook County Courthouse steps

39:59.230 --> 40:01.448
on an extraordinary night

40:01.500 --> 40:03.695
of protests and outrage.
REPORTER 2: It‘s odd
as we're looking

40:03.730 --> 40:05.960
at these images
of protesting downtown.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.639
You go about your life,
not even thinking

40:08.670 --> 40:10.763
about the injustices suffered
by others.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.563
And that's part of the problem.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.737
But tonight we all...

40:14.780 --> 40:17.032
Hello?

40:17.080 --> 40:19.105
I like what
you've done with it.

40:20.510 --> 40:21.875
What's up, David?

40:21.920 --> 40:24.480
I like this office.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.442
It gets the morning light.

40:27.650 --> 40:28.878
I'm glad.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.683
What are you doing here?

40:30.720 --> 40:33.450
I've come home, Alicia.

40:33.490 --> 40:35.128
We're partners again.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.991
Isn't that great?

40:51.910 --> 40:52.945
Did what we had to do,

40:52.980 --> 40:54.106
and we're gonna
keep doing it...

40:54.150 --> 40:55.811
What happened?
Oh, Alicia.

40:55.850 --> 40:56.771
How did the debate go?

40:56.820 --> 40:57.969
We're not sure; we think good.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.089
What's going on?

40:59.120 --> 41:00.712
David Lee was just
in my office,

41:00.750 --> 41:02.058
saying he's coming back.

41:02.090 --> 41:04.558
Yes, we're replacing Evan.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.524
As of when?

41:06.560 --> 41:08.187
An hour ago.

41:08.230 --> 41:09.857
Are you serious?

41:09.900 --> 41:11.629
You...

41:11.670 --> 41:13.023
(sighs)

41:13.070 --> 41:14.867
When did you decide this?

41:14.900 --> 41:15.889
An hour ago.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.806
But you can't just...

41:18.840 --> 41:20.865
(clears throat)

41:20.910 --> 41:23.208
Don't you think it was important
to talk to me?

41:23.240 --> 41:25.071
Well, we tried calling
you, but we had to decide

41:25.110 --> 41:27.203
right away.
I'm a name partner.

41:27.250 --> 41:29.718
This is a decision
for all of us.
No, it isn't,

41:29.750 --> 41:30.842
Alicia, not anymore.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.245
Your running for
state's attorney--

41:32.290 --> 41:33.917
that was a decision
for all of us.

41:33.950 --> 41:35.759
I told you two...
That it was about Castro.

41:35.790 --> 41:38.008
It was about Cary being
prosecuted by him.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.721
Well, Castro's not
in the race anymore,

41:39.760 --> 41:40.954
so why are you still in?

41:55.340 --> 41:57.228
I have 90 volunteers

41:57.280 --> 41:59.544
working for me,
five paid consultants,

41:59.580 --> 42:01.946
small donations
from 38,000 people,

42:01.980 --> 42:03.845
all trying to help me win.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.108
And you're asking why am I

42:05.150 --> 42:06.811
still in?
Look, let's just take...

42:06.850 --> 42:08.886
No! IfI were a man...

42:08.920 --> 42:10.217
Oh, come on.
you never would've...

42:10.260 --> 42:12.558
This is about two people trying
to run a law firm.

42:12.590 --> 42:14.023
This has nothing
to do with sexism.

42:14.060 --> 42:15.288
Like hell it doesn't.

42:15.330 --> 42:17.059
I want to win.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.965
I want to beat my opponent.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.594
You wouldn't even blink if a man

42:21.640 --> 42:22.891
had said that.

42:22.940 --> 42:25.602
Why am I still in?

42:25.640 --> 42:29.701
Because I think I would make
a better state's attorney.

42:29.740 --> 42:31.742
There.

42:32.950 --> 42:34.770
You have a problem with that?

42:44.860 --> 42:46.225
JOHNNY:
Okay, we need to ready

42:46.260 --> 42:47.887
a statement _
for tomorrow's Sun-Times,

42:47.930 --> 42:49.249
and I need you
to get on the phone

42:49.300 --> 42:51.154
with Michael Sneed
in five minutes.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.690
What's wrong?

42:52.730 --> 42:54.163
Nothing. Everything's great.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.838
I'm gonna win.

42:55.870 --> 42:57.929
Yes, you are.

42:57.970 --> 42:59.835
Uh, but we've got to keep
the momentum going.

42:59.870 --> 43:01.633
Prady took a hit tonight,
but we've got to close the deal.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.171
So, uh, Michael Sneed
is a great lady.

43:04.210 --> 43:05.871
I've known_her
for a long time.

43:05.910 --> 43:07.639
She's not gonna come at you
with anything crazy.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.942
She's gonna talk about family,

43:08.980 --> 43:10.971
uh, why you got into law
in the first place...
