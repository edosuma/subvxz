00:11.777 --> 00:13.178
Thanks for taking
care of that, Spike.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.813
After three events in one week,

00:14.815 --> 00:17.115
I really needed to
relax with a good book.

All these ponies coming to you
for advice about friendship.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.856
What's funny about that?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.691
Well, you know, cause
you used to be famous

00:26.693 --> 00:28.093
for being such a bad friend.

00:28.095 --> 00:32.797
What are you talking about? I
had good friends in Canterlot.

00:32.799 --> 00:35.767
Come on, Twilight,
look at the wall.

All my old friends. I can't
remember any of their names

right now, but do you
really think they think

00:50.050 --> 00:51.917
I'm a bad friend?

00:51.919 --> 00:54.753
Well, I only meant that
you've come so far.

Oh, I feel terrible! I've
got to make it up to them.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.993
Pack a bag, Spike! We're
going to Canterlot!

01:03.195 --> 01:05.230

Princess Celestia gave

Just like how I
left my friendships.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.736

03:24.738 --> 03:26.204
That is one of my
friends, right?

03:33.145 --> 03:36.815
Uh, it's not too late to
forget I opened my big mouth.

No, Spike. I'm glad you
opened your big mouth.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.453
These ponies have
probably been suffering

03:41.455 --> 03:44.222
ever since I left, wondering
why their supposed friend

03:44.224 --> 03:46.324
would treat them so badly.

Hey, grab a picture of me
and the Princess, will you?

04:02.843 --> 04:05.210

we used to be friends

back when, but they've
never believed me.

Wait wait wait; really
fluff 'em up, huh?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.194

Hearts and Twinkleshine?

Princess of Friendship!

05:03.370 --> 05:07.172
We saw you at the coronation.
That was some shindig!

05:07.174 --> 05:08.273
You did?

05:08.275 --> 05:10.375
Sure! We see you all the time.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.211
You remember our old
friend Lyra, right?

05:13.213 --> 05:15.113

or she's coming over here.

05:20.085 --> 05:21.519
We've thought about
asking you to join us

05:21.521 --> 05:23.188
from time to time,

05:23.190 --> 05:25.523
but we just sorta
figured you'd moved on.

05:26.525 --> 05:28.159
Oh.

05:30.162 --> 05:32.463
So what brings you by, anyway?

05:32.465 --> 05:34.332
All those times you've
come back to Canterlot,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.835
you've never had
donuts with us before.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.970
Well, uh, you see...

05:41.273 --> 05:42.941
I came to apologize.

05:44.109 --> 05:45.510
For what?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.045
Before I left Canterlot,

05:47.047 --> 05:50.081
I didn't really
appreciate my friends.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.316
And that's because I didn't know

05:51.318 --> 05:53.852
how important friendship was.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.055
But I've learned so much
since I moved to Ponyville.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.624
I learned what it means
to be a good friend

05:59.626 --> 06:02.527
and that I certainly wasn't
one to the three of you.

06:02.529 --> 06:07.232
So, for all the pain I caused
you, I am truly sorry.

06:09.435 --> 06:14.005
[raucous laughter]

06:14.007 --> 06:16.507
Aw, come on, Twilight!

06:16.509 --> 06:19.210
Sure, it might've stung a
little bit when you ran off

06:19.212 --> 06:21.646
to Ponyville without
saying goodbye,

06:21.648 --> 06:24.382
but it's not like we weren't
used to that from you.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.085
Yeah, we didn't
take it personally.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.220
But it's really
good to see you now.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.557
Hey! Anypony up for a
blast from the past?

06:40.499 --> 06:43.001
It's our old science lab!

06:43.003 --> 06:46.237
I have so many great
memories of this place.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.473
Remember when Lemon
Hearts got her head stuck

06:48.475 --> 06:50.074
in that beaker?

06:50.076 --> 06:53.411
[laughter]

06:53.413 --> 06:57.081
[chattering]

07:00.019 --> 07:01.486
...but according to this book,

07:01.488 --> 07:04.555
you're supposed to add the
sodium chloride first.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.358
I read ahead and to
make a proper salt lick,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.928
you need to add
the molasses first.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.664
Well, I read ahead
too, Moondancer,

07:12.666 --> 07:16.067
and I'm sure it said
sodium chloride first.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.938
Oh, I've got the wrong
book. That's so hilarious.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.111
Whatever happened to Moondancer?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.246
Moondancer?

07:28.248 --> 07:30.715
Yeah, you know,
our other friend.

07:30.717 --> 07:35.353
Oh right, Moondancer!
I remember her!

07:35.355 --> 07:37.155
I wonder what she's up to.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.590
Yeah, I always liked her.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.427
We just sort of lost
touch after you left.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.663
I think she went to live out
by the stadium, didn't she?

07:45.665 --> 07:47.165
Well, let's go see!

07:52.671 --> 07:54.706
I think this is the place.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.407
Didn't used to look
like this, though.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.344
She always did like her books.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.547
Hey, kinda like you
used to be, huh?

08:36.549 --> 08:38.683
Exactly how I used to be.

08:53.165 --> 08:57.101
Come on, Twilight, we've been
watching her for three days.

08:57.103 --> 09:00.705
Library, house. Library,
house. That's it.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.740
Nopony looks at
her or says hello

09:02.742 --> 09:04.509
or even gives her a smile.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.511
It's like she
doesn't even exist.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.179
Was she always like this?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.714
Well, she always
was a little shy.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.616
But for a while there she
was really starting to

09:11.618 --> 09:13.084
come out of her shell.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.786
Remember when she
threw that party?

09:16.655 --> 09:20.191
Oh,right. I think you might
have been busy that day.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.330
There you are, Twilight!

09:26.332 --> 09:28.566
Moondancer is having
a little get-together

09:28.568 --> 09:31.169
in the west castle
courtyard. You wanna come?

09:31.171 --> 09:35.606
Ooh, sorry girls. I got a lot
of studying to catch up on.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.683
Thought she might finally
be letting her guard down

09:45.685 --> 09:47.552
a little with that party.

09:47.554 --> 09:50.088
We invited her out a
few times after that,

09:50.090 --> 09:52.557
but she was always
too busy studying.

09:52.559 --> 09:55.393
So eventually we
just stopped asking.

09:55.395 --> 09:58.262
I had no idea that party
was so important to her.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.867
I've got to find a way
to make it up to her.

10:19.785 --> 10:24.755
Oh my gosh! Moondancer? Is that?

10:24.757 --> 10:26.324
SSSSSHHHHH!

10:30.362 --> 10:32.497
Moondancer? Can I talk
to you for a min--

10:32.499 --> 10:33.598
SSSSSHHH!

10:37.269 --> 10:38.569
What is this?

10:38.571 --> 10:40.438
Uh, a bubble of silence.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.706
I haven't seen
you in a while

10:41.708 --> 10:43.808
and I thought it might
be nice to catch up.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.176
For what purpose?

10:46.278 --> 10:48.312
You know. Cause we're friends.

10:50.415 --> 10:51.182
[pop]

10:51.184 --> 10:52.283
SSSSSHHHHH!

10:58.724 --> 11:00.558
I'm really sorry to bother you.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.528
I was just hoping we could go
outside and talk for a bit.

11:10.869 --> 11:12.470
I'm sorry I skipped your party.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.404
AAH!

11:13.406 --> 11:15.606
SSSSSHHHHH!

11:17.376 --> 11:20.811
Why won't you leave me
alone? I'm trying to study!

11:20.813 --> 11:23.915
You've got the wrong pony.
I don't have parties.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.349
You did once.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.251
And I was so caught
up in my own studying

11:27.253 --> 11:29.253
that I didn't take your
feelings into account.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.755
Look, Twilight Twinkle--

11:30.757 --> 11:34.492
Whatever. I just need to be
alone so I can study

11:34.494 --> 11:37.728
without some crazy pony trying
to make friends, all right?

11:37.730 --> 11:39.230
Fine.

11:39.232 --> 11:42.767
How did you get into
my book like that?

11:46.271 --> 11:48.472
I've been studying a
new studying technique.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.208
I can only do it
for a few minutes,

11:50.210 --> 11:51.909
but you'd be amazed how
much you can pick up

11:51.911 --> 11:53.878
when you're
actually in a book.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.646
That's one of Haycart's methods.

11:55.648 --> 11:56.814
You know Haycart?

11:56.816 --> 11:58.683
Of course! He's a genius!

11:58.685 --> 12:00.918
I have a copy of his "Treatise
on Ponies," you know.

12:05.924 --> 12:08.426
What is this place?

12:08.428 --> 12:12.897
This is where I used to live.
You mean I never had you over?

12:12.899 --> 12:16.601
A first edition of
"Principles of Magic"!

12:16.603 --> 12:19.303
Hey. Didn't I
give this to you?

12:19.305 --> 12:21.405
Maybe?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.242
I did! Look, I even wrote
something:

12:24.244 --> 12:26.477
"To my friend,
Twilight Sparkle.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.247
Thanks for introducing
me to the classics."

12:29.249 --> 12:31.415
I can see by the fact
that you left it here

12:31.417 --> 12:33.517
that it meant a lot to you.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.253
Look, I didn't
bring you over here

12:35.255 --> 12:38.489
for even more poignant reminders
of what a bad friend I was.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.524
I brought you here
to give you this.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.294
You can come here
whenever you want

12:43.296 --> 12:45.296
and study to your
heart's content.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.731
Really?

12:46.733 --> 12:49.400
But first you've got
to do something for me.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.935
What?

12:50.937 --> 12:53.771
Have dinner with our
old friends tonight.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.807
I can't; I'm reorganizing
my biology scrolls.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.510
I've been spending a lot of time
with Minuette, Twinkleshine,

12:59.512 --> 13:02.480
and Lemon Hearts since I've been
back. They really miss you.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.449
Look, I already told you,
the last thing I need

13:05.451 --> 13:06.984
is a bunch of ridiculous
friend-making

13:06.986 --> 13:08.719
keeping me from studying.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.722
Moondancer, wait!

13:11.724 --> 13:13.391
A wise pony once taught me

13:13.393 --> 13:15.726
that there's more to life
than dusty old books.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.062
I tried friendship and
it's just not for me.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.764
Now if you'll excuse me.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.903
What if I taught you
Haycart's method?

13:30.676 --> 13:33.878
So, uh, what are you
studying these days?

13:33.880 --> 13:36.580
Science. Magic. History.
Economics. Pottery.

13:36.582 --> 13:41.419
Yowza! You plannin' on being
a professor or something?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.853
No.

13:42.855 --> 13:45.623
So you're just...studying?

13:45.625 --> 13:46.691
Can I go now?

13:46.693 --> 13:48.092
Moondancer, please.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.593
It's all right, Twilight.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.463
We're having a good
time. Right, everypony?

13:55.734 --> 13:58.969
So, uh,Spike, tell
Moondancer that story about

13:58.971 --> 14:02.973
how Twilight had to read a
book about doing a sleepover.

14:02.975 --> 14:04.942
"Slumber 101"? I've read that.

14:04.944 --> 14:09.046
Oh, heh-heh, really?
Well, uh, did you know

14:09.048 --> 14:12.483
Lemon Hearts here works
at the Canterlot palace?

14:12.485 --> 14:15.720
Yeah, it's true. I do
the big events, mostly.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.955
State dinners, that
sort of thing.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.826
[nervous titters]

14:23.028 --> 14:24.395
Ugh!

14:29.835 --> 14:34.438
Moondancer! You've got to
give friendship a chance!

14:34.440 --> 14:37.975
I gave friendship a
chance a long time ago.

14:37.977 --> 14:41.712
It didn't work out then. It
isn't going to work out now.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.948
Twilight? Are you all right?

14:45.617 --> 14:47.952
No. No, I'm not.

14:50.989 --> 14:52.890
Where are you going?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.993
I don't know, Spike, I really
messed this one up.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.429
That party was
everything to her.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.398
I can only imagine what
it must have felt like

15:00.400 --> 15:02.032
when I didn't show up.

15:06.638 --> 15:09.640
Hey, Moondancer! Look
at this spread, huh?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.542
Thank you so much for coming!

15:11.544 --> 15:15.880
Of course! We wouldn't miss one
of our best friend's parties!

15:15.882 --> 15:17.581
Is Twilight coming?

15:23.688 --> 15:26.490
Oh. OK.

15:26.492 --> 15:29.794
Hey, we'll still
have fun, right?

15:31.129 --> 15:32.630
Sure.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.840
If there was only a
way to undo the damage.

15:44.142 --> 15:46.010
I know what I need to do.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.978
And I know just who can help me!

16:01.126 --> 16:04.895
Huh. Guess they must have
gone back to Ponyville.

16:04.897 --> 16:08.766
Wheeee!

16:08.768 --> 16:11.869
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

16:11.871 --> 16:18.142
That was AWESOME! We gotta go
flying more often, Twilight!

16:18.144 --> 16:22.613
I thought you threw in the
ol' towel and headed home!

16:22.615 --> 16:25.483
I did head home, but not
to throw in the towel.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.986
I went to get my secret
weapon. Minuette, meet--

16:28.988 --> 16:30.988
Hey, Pinkie Pie!

16:33.658 --> 16:36.927
Twilight, you didn't say
Minuette would be here!

16:36.929 --> 16:38.662
You two know each other?

16:38.664 --> 16:41.532
Oh, sure! She was one of
Cadance's bridesmaids.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.634
We hang out all the time
when she's in Ponyville.

16:43.636 --> 16:48.739
Hah! And you call yourself
the Princess of Friendship!

16:49.875 --> 16:51.675
Twilight briefed me
on the way here.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.943
We'll need fifteen
bags of confetti

16:52.945 --> 16:54.678
and as many hooves
as we can get.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.248
Let's go! We can pass by
the donut place on the way.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.916
And what are we gonna do?

16:58.918 --> 17:01.051
Just come with me.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.563
Oooh, "A Brief History
of the Wagon Harness"!

17:17.035 --> 17:19.770
"The Life and Times of
Marwari the Maneless"?

17:32.784 --> 17:33.851
[gasp]

17:37.822 --> 17:39.189
What is this?

17:39.191 --> 17:41.091
It's a party. For you.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.995
SURPRISE!

17:46.998 --> 17:48.632
Come on in!

17:48.634 --> 17:51.569
Uh, thanks, but no thanks.
I don't do parties.

17:54.806 --> 17:57.341
I know. And I think
it's my fault.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.109
Back when we were
in school together,

17:59.111 --> 18:01.011
you invited me to a party.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.948
I was so focused on my
studies that I didn't show up.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.649
Big deal.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.017
It was a big deal.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.820
And now that I realize how
important friendship is,

18:09.822 --> 18:12.756
I'd like to make up for my
mistake with a new party.

18:14.059 --> 18:18.162
A party in honor of
my friend, Moondancer.

18:18.164 --> 18:21.599
Please, you've got to let
me make this up to you.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.203
And you think this is
going to do it, huh?

18:27.238 --> 18:28.372
Yes?

18:28.374 --> 18:30.808
Well, sure, why wouldn't it?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.210
That was only the first time I
ever put myself out there

18:33.212 --> 18:36.113
and then you didn't
even bother to show up.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.215
Then you left town
without saying goodbye,

18:38.217 --> 18:40.718
even though we were
supposed to be friends.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.888
I was humiliated! I felt
like I wasn't important!

18:44.890 --> 18:48.359
I never wanted to let myself
be hurt like that again!

18:48.361 --> 18:52.029
Those three finally convinced
me that I had value!

18:52.031 --> 18:55.232
That other ponies might like
me and want to be my friend!

18:55.234 --> 18:58.235
And YOU! DIDN'T! SHOW! UP!

18:59.704 --> 19:04.375
[sobbing]

19:04.377 --> 19:05.743
[whispering]

19:10.348 --> 19:14.084
You're right; this party can't
make up for the way I hurt you.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.720
But please, don't let my
mistake be the reason

19:16.722 --> 19:18.922
you can't be friends
with anypony else.

19:22.093 --> 19:23.394
We were your friends then

19:23.396 --> 19:26.096
and we'd be honored
to be your friends now.

19:35.407 --> 19:40.878
What? That's the librarian,
the book seller, my sister!

19:40.880 --> 19:43.781
You've got a lot of
friends, Moondancer.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.418
I'm sorry, Moondancer.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.821
I've faced magical creatures,
the end of Equestria...

19:50.823 --> 19:52.723
all sorts of things.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.826
But seeing how my
actions affected you,

19:55.828 --> 19:58.462
that was one of the worst
feelings I've ever had.

20:03.001 --> 20:04.902
Thank you, Twilight.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.838
I never realized how much
I needed to hear that.

20:19.417 --> 20:22.786
Now come on, everypony!
Let's party!

20:22.788 --> 20:23.420
Right?

20:23.422 --> 20:24.722
Right!

20:25.890 --> 20:28.092

20:47.246 --> 20:50.447
I think it's time for
us to go, Moondancer.

20:50.449 --> 20:53.150
Thank you for helping me
make some new friends.

20:53.152 --> 20:55.252
Even if they are
my old friends.

20:56.821 --> 20:58.422
We'll come back and visit soon.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.157
That would be great!

21:00.159 --> 21:02.760
You've still got to teach
me that Haycart technique.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.094
Deal.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.064
Um, Moondancer? It
got kinda banged up,

21:07.066 --> 21:08.999
but here's a little
something I wanted to give you

21:09.001 --> 21:11.201
back at your first party.
