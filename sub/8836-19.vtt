WEBVTT

01:36.181 --> 01:38.516
DISHES--ALL THE WAY
FROM FRANCE.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.101
JUST IMAGINE!

01:40.268 --> 01:43.521
YEAH, WELL, HAULING THEM ALL THE
WAY FROM MANKATO IS PLENTY FOR ME.

01:43.688 --> 01:45.648
I HOPE SHE'LL LET US
SEE THEM.

01:45.815 --> 01:48.234
WIDOW THURMOND WILL BE
PROUD TO SHOW THEM TO YOU.

01:48.401 --> 01:50.111
WHY DO THEY
CALL HER WIDOW?

01:50.278 --> 01:53.573
MRS. THURMOND'S AWFUL
YOUNG, AND PRETTY, TOO.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.909
THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY CALL A WOMAN
WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR HUSBAND.

01:56.075 --> 01:57.786
MATTER OF RESPECT,
I GUESS.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.954
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE CALLED WIDOW.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.748
REMINDS ME OF SPIDERS.

02:01.915 --> 02:03.583
[LAUGHING]

02:11.966 --> 02:13.218
THERE YOU GO.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.221
OH!

02:21.601 --> 02:22.602
MR. INGALLS. MARY.

02:22.769 --> 02:23.520
MA'AM.

02:23.686 --> 02:24.938
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MRS. THURMOND.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.106
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
BACK FROM MANKATO SO SOON.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.067
YEAH. WE GOT BACK
THIS MORNING.

02:29.234 --> 02:30.777
I SAVED YOUR ORDER
FOR LAST.

02:30.944 --> 02:32.445
I WAS KIND OF HOPING YOU'D SHOW
YOUR NEW SET OF DISHES TO MARY,

02:32.612 --> 02:33.446
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

02:33.613 --> 02:35.031
OH, IT WOULD BE
MY PLEASURE.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.950
YOU SURE YOU CAN
MANAGE THAT ALONE, NOW?

02:37.116 --> 02:38.910
MR. BURNSIDE WILL BE HERE
SHORTLY TO FEED THE ANIMALS.

02:39.077 --> 02:40.620
OH, I'VE GOT IT
FINE.

02:40.787 --> 02:43.206
WHY DON'T YOU AND I GO IN AND FIX
SOME LEMONADE FOR YOUR FATHER?

02:43.373 --> 02:45.166
I THINK HE'LL WANT SOME
BY THE TIME HE'S FINISHED.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.294
THANK YOU. I NEVER SAW ANY
REAL CHINA FROM FRANCE BEFORE.

02:48.461 --> 02:50.839
WELL, MARY, TO TELL YOU THE
TRUTH, NEITHER HAVE I.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.222
Charles:
THERE YOU Go.

03:06.479 --> 03:07.981
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.483
IT'S EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I EXPECTED.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.485
YOUR HUSBAND MADE AN EXCELLENT
CHOICE, MRS. THURMOND.

03:12.652 --> 03:13.528
I'VE NEVER SEEN PRETTIER.

03:13.695 --> 03:15.405
ARTHUR WAS ALWAYS
SO THOUGHTFUL.

03:15.572 --> 03:16.489
NEITHER OF US
HAD ANY IDEA

03:16.656 --> 03:20.118
HOW THINGS COULD
CHANGE SO BEFORE...

03:20.285 --> 03:22.662
WELL, HOW ABOUT
THAT LEMONADE NOW?

03:22.829 --> 03:24.247
MARY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR FATHER INTO THE PARLOR

03:24.414 --> 03:26.499
AND DO THE HONORS--
I'LL GET SOME COOKIES.

03:26.666 --> 03:27.750
THANK YOU.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.350
ISN'T THIS
THE PRETTIEST ROOM, PA?

03:44.517 --> 03:46.477
YEAH. THAT IT IS,
SWEETHEART.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.646
ABOUT THE FINEST HOUSE
I EVER DID SEE.

03:48.813 --> 03:51.733
MY GOODNESS. I ALMOST FORGOT
THE ICE FOR THE LEMONADE.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.693
YOU EVEN HAVE YOUR OWN ICEHOUSE, MRS.
THURMOND?

03:53.860 --> 03:55.153
MM-HMM.
IT'S JUST A SMALL ONE.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.697
ARTHUR BUILT IT FOR ME
WHEN HE PUT UP THE HOUSE.

03:57.864 --> 03:59.616
MA MAKES
GOOD LEMONADE.

03:59.782 --> 04:01.075
WE DON'T HAVE
AN ICEHOUSE.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.120
I JUST HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND
TO BUILDING ONE YET.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.204
THANK YOU.

04:05.371 --> 04:06.581
MR. INGALLS.
WHY DON'T WE SIT DOWN.

04:08.708 --> 04:09.876
WOULD YOU LIKE
A COOKIE, MARY?

04:10.043 --> 04:12.045
MMM. THAT'S AN AWFULLY
NICE DISH, TOO.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.631
THANK YOU, BUT I THINK WE'VE
SEEN THE LAST OF THESE.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.674
AS SOON AS YOUR FATHER
FINISHES MY CHINA CABINET,

04:16.841 --> 04:18.676
THEN I'LL HAVE A PROPER
PLACE FOR THE NEW ONES.

04:18.843 --> 04:21.054
IT WON'T BE LONG. I DID MOST OF THE
HARD WORK BEFORE I WENT TO MANKATO.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.305
MAYBE TOMORROW.

04:22.472 --> 04:24.724
WONDERFUL. I CAN'T WAIT
TO SHOW THEM OFF.

04:24.891 --> 04:26.434
WHAT WILL YOU DO
WITH THE OLD SET?

04:26.601 --> 04:27.727
OH, PROBABLY STORE THEM

04:27.894 --> 04:30.772
UNTIL SOMEBODY COMES ALONG
WHO WANTS TO BUY THEM.

04:30.939 --> 04:32.231
MA SURE WOULD
LIKE THEM.

04:32.398 --> 04:33.900
MARY, MIND YOUR MANNERS.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.069
OH, WELL, MR. INGALLS, IF YOU THINK
YOUR WIFE WOULD TRULY LIKE THEM,

04:36.235 --> 04:39.697
I'D BE HAPPY TO ACCEPT YOUR
WORK ON THE CABINET AS PAYMENT.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.157
YOU CAN TAKE THEM
WITH YOU.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.742
WELL, I APPRECIATE
THAT VERY MUCH--

04:42.909 --> 04:44.160
OH, COULD WE, PA?

04:44.327 --> 04:45.328
MA WOULD LOVE THEM,

04:45.495 --> 04:46.537
AND THEY'D BE
SO EASY TO WASH.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.248
I PROMISE I'D
DO THEM EVERY NIGHT.

04:49.415 --> 04:52.085
THEY'D ONLY BE
GOING TO WASTE HERE.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.336
WELL, AS I SAID,
I APPRECIATE IT,

04:53.503 --> 04:55.254
BUT DISHES LIKE THAT
MUST COME PRETTY DEAR.

04:55.421 --> 04:56.756
TO BE VERY HONEST
WITH YOU,

04:56.923 --> 04:59.092
WE NEED THE MONEY RIGHT NOW
MORE THAN WE DO THE DISHES.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.927
I COULD WORK EXTRA
FOR MRS. WHIPPLE.

05:01.094 --> 05:02.762
THAT WOULD HELP SOME.

05:02.929 --> 05:04.597
NEVER ARGUE WITH A MAN'S
PRACTICALITY, MARY.

05:04.764 --> 05:06.224
YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT.

05:06.391 --> 05:09.143
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS MORE
IMPORTANT TO A FAMILY THAN DISHES.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.895
THANK YOU ANYWAY.

05:11.062 --> 05:14.899
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU FIX YOURSELF
SOME LEMONADE BEFORE THE ICE MELTS,

05:15.066 --> 05:16.693
AND I'LL GET YOUR FATHER
HIS MONEY.

05:19.779 --> 05:21.072
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME MORE, PA?

05:21.239 --> 05:23.366
MM. MAYBE JUST
A LITTLE MORE ICE.

05:30.415 --> 05:32.917
SURE ARE
PRETTY DISHES, PA.

05:33.084 --> 05:35.545
MARY, WE'VE TALKED
ENOUGH ABOUT THE DISHES.

05:35.712 --> 05:36.921
YES, SIR.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.475
HAND-PAINTED IN FRANCE, MRS.
THURMOND SAID.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.477
MM. SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.271
DID SHE SAY HOW MANY
WERE IN THE SET?

05:53.438 --> 05:54.939
SHE DIDN'T SAY, BUT
IT WAS A BIG BARREL.

05:55.106 --> 05:56.315
MUST HAVE BEEN
A LOT.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.609
THAT SOUNDS
TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE.

05:58.776 --> 06:01.946
CHARLES, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT CHINA LIKE THAT COSTS?

06:02.113 --> 06:04.991
UH, NO, DEAR.
I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW.

06:05.158 --> 06:06.826
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I GOT A GOOD IDEA TODAY.

06:06.993 --> 06:10.496
I THOUGHT EDWARDS AND I COULD PITCH
IN AND BUILD A COUPLE OF ICEHOUSES.

06:10.663 --> 06:11.998
CHARLES, WE DON'T NEED
AN ICEHOUSE.

06:12.165 --> 06:13.833
THE ICE WAS AWFUL GOOD
IN THE LEMONADE TODAY.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.044
Laura: WE COULD EVEN
MAKE ICE CREAM.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.212
SURE. YOU SEE? LOT OF THINGS
WE CAN DO WITH THE ICE.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.630
LAKES FREEZE OVER,
WE HARVEST THE ICE-

06:19.797 --> 06:20.965
WITH ALL THE STRAW
AND SAWDUST WE'VE GOT,

06:21.132 --> 06:22.341
lT'LL KEEP
THE WHOLE SUMMER.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.803
HEY, WE CAN EVEN HAVE
ICICLES IN THE SUMMERTIME!

06:25.970 --> 06:27.555
I LIKE ICICLES.

06:27.722 --> 06:28.639
YOU DO?

06:28.806 --> 06:30.099
Charles: THERE YOU Go.
WHAT Do YOU SAY?

06:30.266 --> 06:32.143
SAY YES, MA. I THINK
HAVING OUR OWN ICEHOUSE

06:32.310 --> 06:33.978
WOULD BE THE BEST
THING I CAN THINK OF,

06:34.145 --> 06:36.522
EXCEPT MAYBE A SET OF CHINA LIKE MRS.
THURMOND'S.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.566
WELL, IT'S A WHILE
BEFORE THE FIRST FREEZE.

06:38.733 --> 06:40.735
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.529
WELL, I BETTER STOP TALKING AND
GET TO WORK ON THAT CABINET.

06:43.696 --> 06:44.530
DON'T WORK TOO LATE.

06:44.697 --> 06:45.823
I WON'T.

06:52.914 --> 06:56.042
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
CHARLES.

06:56.209 --> 06:57.168
IT IS TURNING OUT NICE.

06:57.335 --> 06:58.628
BUT IT'S NOT
ALL FINISHED YET.

06:58.795 --> 07:01.130
HANSON'S ORDERED SOME
SPECIAL GLASS FROM MANKATO.

07:01.297 --> 07:02.715
GOING TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL
WHEN THAT'S IN.

07:02.882 --> 07:05.927
OH, EVEN
WITHOUT THE GLASS...

07:06.094 --> 07:08.721
THE WIDOW THURMOND
IS GETTING A BARGAIN.

07:08.888 --> 07:10.598
I JUST WISH
I WAS DOING IT FOR YOU.

07:10.765 --> 07:13.768
WELL, I DON'T THINK OUR
DISHES WOULD DO IT JUSTICE.

07:13.935 --> 07:17.063
BESIDES, THERE ARE A LOT
OF THINGS WE NEED MORE.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.899
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS DID MEAN TO
GET YOU A BETTER SET OF DISHES.

07:20.066 --> 07:23.736
OH, CHARLES,
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

07:23.903 --> 07:24.737
RIGHT NOW,
I'D SETTLE FOR

07:24.904 --> 07:26.405
A LITTLE MORE
TIME WITH YOU.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.866
WITH THE TRIP
TO MANKATO AND ALL,

07:29.033 --> 07:30.952
IT SEEMS LIKE
I HARDLY EVER SEE YOU.

07:31.119 --> 07:32.411
IT WON'T BE LONG-- AS SOON AS I
GET SPRAGUE PAID OFF AT THE BANK.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.496
THAT'LL BE IT,
I PROMISE.

07:33.663 --> 07:34.455
PROMISE?

07:34.622 --> 07:36.082
PROMISE.

07:36.249 --> 07:39.001
WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK
SOME MORE, WILL YOU PUT THIS ON?

07:39.168 --> 07:40.294
I DON'T WANT YOU
GETTING SICK.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.756
ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE IN
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

07:43.923 --> 07:45.758
I LOVE YOU.

07:45.925 --> 07:46.759
GOOD NIGHT.

07:46.926 --> 07:48.010
GOOD NIGHT.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.104
DISHES.

08:05.403 --> 08:06.696
OH, MORNING, MR. SPRAGUE.

08:06.863 --> 08:09.866
MORNING, MR. INGALLS.
YOU'RE A DAY EARLY.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.784
I REALLY WISH THAT
ALL MY CUSTOMERS

08:11.951 --> 08:14.412
WERE AS PROMPT ABOUT
PAYING THEIR NOTES.

08:14.579 --> 08:16.664
WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHY I'M HERE.

08:16.831 --> 08:17.957
THERE'S NO TROUBLE,
IS THERE?

08:18.124 --> 08:19.458
NO, NO. NO TROUBLE.
I'VE GOT THE MONEY.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.836
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE,

08:22.003 --> 08:23.588
SORT OF AN INVESTMENT.

08:23.754 --> 08:26.632
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WANT
AN EXTENSION ON YOUR NOTE.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.301
NO, NO. I'M GOING TO PAY
THE LOAN OFF TOMORROW.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.886
THERE'S NO TROUBLE
AT ALL.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.346
WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WAS ANOTHER LOAN,

08:32.513 --> 08:34.015
JUST A SMALL ONE.

08:34.182 --> 08:36.184
ABOUT $8.00.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.977
$8.00.

08:38.144 --> 08:39.478
YEAH. IT WOULD MEAN
AN AWFUL LOT TO ME,

08:39.645 --> 08:41.939
AND I COULD PAY YOU BACK
AT HARVEST TIME.

08:42.106 --> 08:45.651
HMM. WELL, MAYBE,
BUT, UH...OF COURSE,

08:45.818 --> 08:48.321
I WOULD HAVE TO KNOW THE
NATURE OF THE INVESTMENT,

08:48.487 --> 08:50.907
THE PROSPECT
OF RETURN, AND...

08:51.073 --> 08:52.491
IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF
AN INVESTMENT.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.952
THIS IS MORE OF
A PERSONAL THING.

08:55.119 --> 08:57.830
MR. INGALLS, I'VE FOUND THAT MONEY
BORROWED FOR PERSONAL REASONS

08:57.997 --> 08:59.248
IS BEST DONE WITHOUT.

08:59.415 --> 09:02.168
HOWEVER, IF YOU TELL ME
IT'S ESSENTIAL, WELL...

09:02.335 --> 09:04.295
WELL, I REALLY CAN'T SAY
THAT IT'S ESSENTIAL, BUT--

09:04.462 --> 09:06.672
WELL, GOOD. NOW YOU'VE
MADE YOUR OWN DECISION.

09:06.839 --> 09:09.050
I'M VERY GLAD I WAS ABLE TO
HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

09:09.217 --> 09:10.843
BUT, MR. SPRAGUE, I DIDN'T SAY
I'D CHANGED MY MIND.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.137
OH, BUT YOU WILL. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A BANKER TO SEE THAT.

09:13.304 --> 09:15.097
MR. INGALLS,
A MAN'S GOOD CREDIT

09:15.264 --> 09:17.266
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS
OWN PERSONAL COMFORT.

09:17.433 --> 09:21.896
YOU REMEMBER THAT AND YOU'LL NEVER
MAKE ANY MISTAKES. GOOD DAY.

09:22.063 --> 09:23.022
YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU.

09:23.189 --> 09:24.273
ALL RIGHT.

09:49.215 --> 09:52.385
OH, IT'S NICE TO SEE GLASS
IN THOSE DOORS AGAIN.

09:52.551 --> 09:53.594
I DON'T MIND
TELLING YOU,

09:53.761 --> 09:55.972
I'LL BE GLAD WHEN
I GET THIS FINISHED.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.390
IF I'D HAVE BROKEN ONE
OF THESE PANES OF GLASS,

09:57.556 --> 09:59.225
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN
5 YEARS OFF MY LIFE.

09:59.392 --> 10:01.269
[LAUGHS]
You SOUND LIKE ARTHUR

10:01.435 --> 10:03.062
THE DAY HE PUT
THE WINDOWS IN.

10:03.229 --> 10:04.313
HE SAID IF THERE'D
BEEN ONE MORE,

10:04.480 --> 10:06.732
HE WOULD RATHER HAVE
LEFT HOME THAN FINISH.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.234
WELL, I DON'T KNOW A MAN
THAT WORKS WITH WOOD

10:08.401 --> 10:09.944
THAT LIKES
WORKING WITH GLASS.

10:10.111 --> 10:11.362
THERE YOU GO.

10:15.741 --> 10:18.911
OH, THERE, NOW.

10:19.078 --> 10:21.414
DOESN'T THAT
MAKE IT ALL WORTH IT?

10:21.580 --> 10:23.708
I MUST SAY, IT MAKES MY
WOODWORK LOOK TWICE AS GOOD.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.960
YOU'RE FAR TOO MODEST,
MR. INGALLS.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.086
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SANDWICH

10:27.253 --> 10:28.462
AND A NICE COLD
GLASS OF BUTTERMILK

10:28.629 --> 10:29.880
WHILE I GET THE REST
OF YOUR MONEY?

10:30.047 --> 10:31.132
THANK YOU.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.214
MR. INGALLS,
HERE YOU ARE.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.050
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.509
I WAS JUST LOOKING
AT YOUR WOODWORK HERE.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.762
OH, ISN'T IT TERRIBLE?

11:17.928 --> 11:20.723
ARTHUR USED AN EXPENSIVE EUROPEAN
VARNISH AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK.

11:20.890 --> 11:22.683
HE REDID THE REST
OF THE ROOMS, BUT, UH...

11:22.850 --> 11:24.435
HE NEVER GOT TO THIS ONE.

11:24.602 --> 11:27.521
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD STRIP THAT
WOOD DOWN AND PUT A SEALER ON IT.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.316
OH, BUT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK.

11:30.483 --> 11:31.901
TELL YOU WHAT--

11:32.068 --> 11:36.113
I'LL REDO THE WOODWORK IN TRADE
FOR YOUR OLD SET OF DISHES.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.324
OH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
SEEM QUITE FAIR.

11:38.491 --> 11:40.785
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WORK, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE TRADE.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.621
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. BUT I KNOW
THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT THAT IT TAKES.

11:43.788 --> 11:46.332
I THINK YOU'RE
UNDERPRICING YOURSELF.

11:46.499 --> 11:47.583
I THINK IT'S FAIR.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.542
A DEAL?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.586
OH...A DEAL.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.505
THANK YOU.

11:52.671 --> 11:53.631
I'LL START TOMORROW AS SOON
AS I FINISH AT THE MILL.

11:53.798 --> 11:54.673
THAT'LL BE FINE.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.883
YOU KNOW,
I'D APPRECIATE IT

11:56.050 --> 11:57.176
IF YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

11:57.343 --> 11:58.427
I'D KIND OF LIKE
TO SURPRISE CAROLINE.

11:58.594 --> 11:59.470
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ARTHUR.

11:59.637 --> 12:00.763
EVERYTHING HAD TO BE
A SURPRISE.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.056
MAKES IT
TWICE AS MUCH FUN.

12:02.223 --> 12:03.682
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T MENTION YOUR SECRET.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.059
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
THANK YOU.

12:05.226 --> 12:06.435
RIGHT. TOMORROW.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.360

12:18.531 --> 12:20.991

TO GET YOUR DISHES.

12:45.724 --> 12:46.517
[JACK BARKS]

12:46.684 --> 12:48.144
GO ON, JACK.
YOU STAY OUT.

12:57.820 --> 12:58.988
CHARLES.

12:59.155 --> 13:01.073
OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN TO WAKE YOU.

13:05.244 --> 13:06.912
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP SO EARLY?

13:07.079 --> 13:08.581
I TOLD YOU, I GOT A LOT OF
EXTRA WORK AT THE MILL.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.708
I WANTED TO GET
AN EARLY START.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.376
SO YOU GO
WITHOUT BREAKFAST?

13:12.543 --> 13:15.087
WELL, YOU WERE SLEEPING SO PRETTY,
I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.422
AND YOU MAKE
YOUR OWN LUNCH?

13:16.589 --> 13:18.090
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M DOING A GOOD JOB.

13:21.552 --> 13:22.761
AND WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO WITH THIS ONE

13:22.928 --> 13:25.473
THAT I MADE YOU LAST NIGHT?

13:25.639 --> 13:27.641
I TOLD YOU ALL THAT EXTRA
WORK GIVES ME A BIG APPETITE.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.101
I'LL TAKE THEM BOTH
WITH ME.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.523

SOME EXTRA SLEEP.

13:34.690 --> 13:35.774
BYE-BYE.

13:57.338 --> 14:00.132
HEY, CHARLES,
TAKE IT EASY.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.510
YOU'RE NO USE TO ME IF
YOU BREAK YOUR BACK.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.304
I'D HAVE TO HIRE TWO
MULES TO DO YOUR JOB.

14:05.471 --> 14:07.473
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
THROUGH IT, THAT'S ALL.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.016
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
GET OFF A COUPLE HOURS EARLY

14:09.183 --> 14:10.476
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

14:10.643 --> 14:12.144
ANOTHER OUTSIDE JOB?

14:12.311 --> 14:14.063
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

14:14.230 --> 14:15.940
LOOK, IF YOU'RE HAVING
TROUBLE WITH SPRAGUE,

14:16.106 --> 14:17.525
MAYBE I CAN
HELP YOU.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.026
NO. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

14:19.193 --> 14:21.278
I JUST NEED SOME TIME,
IS ALL.

14:21.445 --> 14:22.947
WELL, YOU ALWAYS
GET HERE EARLY,

14:23.113 --> 14:24.657
SO I DON'T CARE
IF YOU LEAVE EARLY.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.783
I APPRECIATE IT.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.451
AH. IT'S NOTHING.

Sprague: MM-HMM.

14:35.376 --> 14:40.839
5, 10, 11, 12, 13.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.676
SEEMS TO BE CORRECT.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.219
AND THERE'S YOUR NOTE.

14:45.386 --> 14:46.345
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MR. SPRAGUE.

14:46.512 --> 14:47.721
A PLEASURE DOING
BUSINESS WITH YOU.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.473
OH, NO. THE PLEASURE'S
ALL MINE, MR. INGALLS.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.183
YOU SEE, MOST BANK CUSTOMERS
DON'T REALIZE

14:51.350 --> 14:53.769
THAT A BANKER LIKES TO SEE HIS
CUSTOMERS BUILD UP GOOD CREDIT

14:53.936 --> 14:54.937
AS WELL AS THEY DO.

14:55.104 --> 14:57.314
THAT IS THE SECRET
TO THE GROWTH OF A BANK.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.483
I'LL REMIND YOU OF THAT
NEXT TIME I NEED A LOAN.

14:59.650 --> 15:00.776
OH, UH, MR. INGALLS,

15:00.943 --> 15:02.528
REGARDING OUR CONVERSATION
OF YESTERDAY, UH,

15:02.695 --> 15:04.113
CONSIDERING THE FACT
THAT YOU'VE PAID OFF YOUR NOTE,

15:04.280 --> 15:06.615
IF YOU STILL WISH TO BORROW
THE $8.00, WELL, UH...

15:06.782 --> 15:08.200
NO, NO. WHAT YOU GAVE ME
WAS SOUND ADVICE.

15:08.367 --> 15:11.078
A MAN SHOULD NEVER BORROW
MONEY IF HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.788
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS AWAY.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.665
NO. YOU DIDN'T. I JUST DON'T
NEED THE MONEY ANYMORE.

15:14.832 --> 15:15.916
THANK YOU.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.422
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU SAY, LAURA.

15:21.589 --> 15:23.465
THE MOON DOESN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

15:23.632 --> 15:25.384
WITH WHETHER FISH BITE OR NOT.

15:25.551 --> 15:29.013
IT DOES TOO, WILLIE. EVERYONE KNOWS
FISH BITE BETTER DURING THE FULL MOON.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.431
THE FISH CAN'T
SEE THE MOON,

15:30.598 --> 15:33.309
SO HOW DO THEY KNOW IF
THEY'RE HUNGRY OR NOT?

15:33.475 --> 15:35.686
COME ON, LAURA. WILLIE WOULD
ARGUE WITH A SCARECROW.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.606
WELL, I'M NOT A SCARECROW, I'M
RIGHT, AND I CAN PROVE IT RIGHT NOW.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.232
I'LL BET YOU
MY BEST AGGIE.

15:40.399 --> 15:41.817
OK. I'LL GO
ASK MY PA.

15:41.984 --> 15:42.818
OH, LAURA.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.821

EARLY, LAURA.

15:51.744 --> 15:52.911
WELL, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS?

15:53.078 --> 15:56.081
NO. I'M AFRAID NOT.
UH, CAN I HELP YOU?

15:56.248 --> 15:57.708
YES, SIR.
WILLIE HERE

15:57.875 --> 16:00.419
DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT FISH BITE
BETTER DURING A FULL MOON.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.004
THEY HAVE A BET.

16:02.171 --> 16:04.632
WELL, I KNOW THAT THE MOON HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE TIDES,

16:04.798 --> 16:08.052
BUT I CAN'T SAY
AS I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FISH.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.637
THERE.
I TOLD YOU.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.430
PAY UP,
YOUR BEST AGGIE.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.098
HOLD YOUR HORSES,
WILLIE.

16:13.265 --> 16:15.100
YOU SAID YOU COULD
PROVE IT RIGHT NOW,

16:15.267 --> 16:17.269
DIDN'T SHE, MARY?

16:17.436 --> 16:19.480
WILLIE'S RIGHT, LAURA.
I THINK YOU OWE HIM.

16:19.647 --> 16:20.856
BUT PA ISN'T HERE.

16:21.023 --> 16:25.736
DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE.
YOU LOSE.

16:25.903 --> 16:26.987
HERE.

16:30.532 --> 16:31.825
SORRY.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.035
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

16:33.202 --> 16:35.037
I'LL ONLY WIN IT
BACK FROM HIM, ANYWAY.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.129
NOW, NOT EATING
YOUR SUPPER

ISN'T GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER
ABOUT LOSING YOUR AGGIE TO WILLIE.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.885
IF PA HAD BEEN AT THE MILL,
I WOULD HAVE WON.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.471
WELL, YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO
GAMBLE ANYWAY, YOUNG LADY.

16:52.638 --> 16:53.806
I TRIED TO TELL
HER NOT TO,

16:53.972 --> 16:55.391
BUT IF MR. HANSON HAD
KNOWN WHERE PA WAS,

16:55.557 --> 16:56.642
SHE WOULD HAVE
WALKED TO SLEEPY EYE

16:56.809 --> 16:58.435
TO KEEP FROM GMNG
HER AGGIE TO WILLIE.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.770
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I KNOW I'M RIGHT

16:59.937 --> 17:01.355
AND PA
CAN TELL WILLIE SO.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.982
YOUR PA HAS BETTER THINGS TO
DO THAN WIN YOUR BETS FOR YOU.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

THE MILL ALL DAY?

22:22.509 --> 22:24.845
YES. ISN'T IT LOVELY?

22:25.012 --> 22:27.222
MARY TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR LOVELY NEW CHINA.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.140
DID SHE?

22:28.306 --> 22:29.641
OH, NEW CHINA!

22:29.808 --> 22:33.270
MY, THERE'S NOTHING I APPRECIATE
MORE THAN FINE CHINA.

22:33.437 --> 22:36.398
WELL, I'LL HAVE TO HAVE YOU LADIES
OVER SOMEDAY SOON AND SHOW IT OFF.

22:36.565 --> 22:37.482
OH, WELL.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.234
EXCUSE ME.
I REALLY MUST RUN.

22:40.819 --> 22:44.573
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE VERY
PLEASED WITH CHARLES' WORK.

22:44.740 --> 22:45.949
OH, YOU MEAN THE CABINET.

22:46.116 --> 22:48.076
IT'S LOVELY.
WE'RE REALLY QUITE LUCKY

22:48.243 --> 22:51.371
TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE MR. INGALLS
IN WALNUT GROVE.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.915
I THINK SO.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.751
WELL, EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE TO GO.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.838
OH! MRS. THURMOND,

23:00.005 --> 23:02.841
DON'T FORGET YOUR PASTILLES.

23:03.008 --> 23:05.052
OH, MRS. THURMOND!

23:07.304 --> 23:09.389
[No AUDIO]

23:38.335 --> 23:39.878
OH, MY.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.047
SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE LADY,
THE WIDOW THURMOND.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.758
SUCH EXQUISITE TASTE
AND...

23:44.925 --> 23:46.051
SO REFINED.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.265
AH, I MUST SAY, SHE
CERTAINLY IS A CUT ABOVE

23:52.432 --> 23:55.894
WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO
FIND IN WALNUT GROVE.

23:56.061 --> 23:57.187
SHE'S VERY NICE.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.147
OH, BUT IT'S
SUCH A TRAGEDY,

23:59.314 --> 24:03.276
SUCH A LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN
HAVING TO LIVE ALL ALONE,

24:03.443 --> 24:06.738
AND SO WELL-TO-DO.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.740
HOW MUCH IS THIS?

24:08.907 --> 24:09.783
HMM?

24:09.950 --> 24:10.909
THIS CHALLIS?

24:11.076 --> 24:12.869
OH, IT'S RATHER
EXPENSIVE,

24:13.036 --> 24:15.622
I'M AFRAID--
45 CENTS A YARD.

24:17.666 --> 24:19.292
I'LL TAKE A YARD
AND A HALF, PLEASE.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.920
OH, MY, THAT'S RATHER
EXTRAVAGANT, ISN'T IT?

24:22.087 --> 24:23.213
NOW, HERE, HERE.

24:23.380 --> 24:28.760
THIS IS A VERY, VERY
SERVICEABLE PIECE OF GOODS.

24:28.927 --> 24:29.719
THERE.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.596
I LIKE THIS.

24:31.763 --> 24:32.597
THANK YOU.

24:32.764 --> 24:33.849
ALL RIGHT.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.573
WILL YOU HURRY UP? WE'RE
NEVER GOING TO GET HOME.

24:49.739 --> 24:50.740
THERE'S NO HURRY.

24:50.907 --> 24:51.867
THERE IS
IF PA GETS HOME

24:52.033 --> 24:53.743
AND WE HAVEN'T
DONE OUR CHORES.

24:53.910 --> 24:56.121
PA TOLD MA
HE'D BE LATE.

24:56.288 --> 25:00.041
HE HAS TO GO TO SLEEPY EYE-- FOR MR.
HANSON.

25:00.208 --> 25:01.001
LAURA.

25:01.168 --> 25:02.502
HUH?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.963
THAT'S PA'S WAGON IN FRONT OF MRS.
THURMOND'S.

25:09.176 --> 25:11.178
I WONDER WHAT
HE'S DOING OUT HERE.

25:11.344 --> 25:14.347
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO SLEEPY EYE.

25:14.514 --> 25:18.268
AH, MR. HANSON PROBABLY
CHANGED HIS MIND IS ALL.

25:18.435 --> 25:19.811
COME ON. WE'D BETTER
GET HOME.

25:36.411 --> 25:38.038
[BARKING]

25:38.205 --> 25:39.122
WHAT DO
YOU SAY, JACK?

25:39.289 --> 25:40.624
HI, PA! HI, GIRLS!

25:40.790 --> 25:41.666
HI, PA!

25:41.833 --> 25:43.168
THEY GOT YOU
WORKING HARD, HUH?

25:43.335 --> 25:44.628
Mary: YEAH.

25:44.794 --> 25:49.966
OH, YOUR PA'S HOME.
OOH, HAVE TO HIDE MAMA'S BLOUSE.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.594
OH, THAT'S A GOOD GIRL, CARRIE.
THANK YOU.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.353
NOW, CARRIE, REMEMBER,

26:01.519 --> 26:03.230
KEEP A SECRET
ABOUT MA'S BLOUSE.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.314
YES, MA.

26:04.481 --> 26:06.191
THANK YOU.

26:06.358 --> 26:07.108
CHARLES, HELLO!

26:07.275 --> 26:08.443
Charles:
HI, DARLIN'.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.487
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU MADE
IT HOME BEFORE DARK.

26:10.654 --> 26:13.114
WILL YOU HURRY? SUPPER'S
READY AND IT'S A SURPRISE.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.115
BE RIGHT IN.

26:14.282 --> 26:15.367
GOOD.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.371
Mary: DID YOU
HAVE A GOOD DAY, PA?

26:19.537 --> 26:22.457
OH, IT'S NEVER TOO GOOD A DAY WHEN I
GOT THAT LONG TRIP TO SLEEPY EYE.

26:45.897 --> 26:50.860
MARY. MARY.
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

26:51.027 --> 26:53.154
I'M TRYING TO.

26:53.321 --> 26:55.198
MARY, WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE
PA DIDN'T TELL THE TRUTH

26:55.365 --> 26:57.575
ABOUT WHERE HE WAS
THIS AFTERNOON?

26:57.742 --> 26:59.619
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
ANY OF OUR BUSINESS.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.079
IT WILL BE IF
THE WIDOW THURMOND

27:01.246 --> 27:04.416
TURNS OUT TO BE LIKE THE
WICKED WIDOW IN "CINDERELLA."

27:04.582 --> 27:06.710
SHE WASN'T A WIDOW. SHE WAS
THE WICKED STEPMOTHER.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.295
WELL, SHE DIDN'T HAVE
A HUSBAND.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.423
SHE WAS SO MEAN, MAYBE HER
HUSBAND JUST RAN AWAY FROM HOME.

27:11.589 --> 27:16.011
WELL, ANYWAY, SHE TRIED TO STEAL THE
HANDSOME PRINCE AWAY FROM CINDERELLA.

27:16.177 --> 27:18.096
WELL, WHAT'S THAT
GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

27:18.263 --> 27:22.017
WELL, PA'S HANDSOME, AND THE WIDOW
THURMOND DOESN'T HAVE A HUSBAND.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.810
LAURA, THAT'S
A WICKED THOUGHT.

27:23.977 --> 27:26.354
NOT IF SHE'S REALLY
A WICKED WIDOW.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.192
MRS. THURMOND WOULDN'T
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

27:34.446 --> 27:35.613
OR WOULD SHE?

27:41.161 --> 27:42.829
GOOD NIGHT.

27:42.996 --> 27:44.122
GOOD NIGHT.

28:00.472 --> 28:01.556
[BLOWS]

28:12.901 --> 28:14.652
CHARLES?

28:14.819 --> 28:17.447
OH, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ASLEEP.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.282
HOW'D YOU LIKE
THE PICKLED PEARS?

28:19.449 --> 28:22.494
OH, THEY WERE DELICIOUS.
I ATE THE WHOLE JARFUL.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.662
THEY'RE MRS. BURNSIDE'S.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.749
WELL, WHEN YOU SEE HER, YOU
BE SURE TO THANK HER FOR ME.

28:27.916 --> 28:30.710
MR. BURNSIDE
BROUGHT THEM BY TODAY.

28:30.877 --> 28:31.753
OH, HAROLD?

28:31.920 --> 28:33.004
MM-HMM.

28:33.171 --> 28:34.756
WHEN I SEE HIM,
I'LL THANK HIM.

28:37.801 --> 28:40.970
HE WORKS FOR THE WIDOW
THURMOND, DOESN'T HE?

28:43.431 --> 28:47.060
YEAH. HE DID THE LAST TIME I HEARD.
WHY?

28:47.227 --> 28:48.728
OH, NO REASON...

28:50.814 --> 28:54.651
JUST THAT HE SAID HE SAW
YOUR WAGON OUT THERE AND...

28:54.818 --> 28:56.653
I THOUGHT YOU'D FINISHED
WORK ON THE CABINET.

28:58.405 --> 29:01.116
YEAH, I DID. I WAS JUST DELIVERING
SOME LUMBER OUT FOR MR. HANSON.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.078
WIDOW THURMOND'S
BUYING LUMBER?

29:07.372 --> 29:11.418
YEAH. SHE'S, UH, SHE'S PLANNING ON
DOING SOME FIXING UP ON THE PLACE.

29:13.878 --> 29:16.673
I GUESS THAT MEANS YOU'LL
BE WORKING FOR HER AGAIN.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.552
YEAH. IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME
QUITE A WHILE TO FINISH UP.

29:20.718 --> 29:26.391
GOOD. THERE'S SOME THINGS I NEED
TO ORDER FROM THE MERCANTILE.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.977
YEAH, WELL, I THINK YOU OUGHT TO
WAIT ON THAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

29:29.144 --> 29:33.189
WHY? YOU SAID YOU'D BE
EARNING THE EXTRA MONEY.

29:33.356 --> 29:35.108
WELL, I KNOW THAT, BUT I'D LIKE
TO HAVE THE CASH IN MY HAND.

29:35.275 --> 29:37.652
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT CHARGING.

29:37.819 --> 29:38.945
ALL RIGHT.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.281
GOOD NIGHT.

29:41.448 --> 29:42.574
GOOD NIGHT.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.259
I FOUND SOME MORE!

30:13.438 --> 30:14.606
LOOK AT THESE, PA.

30:14.772 --> 30:15.815
HEY, THOSE
ARE NICE ONES.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.484
THEY SURE ARE.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.402
YOU TWO MAKE MUSHROOM HUNTING
REAL EASY.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.779
WE LIKE IT. BESIDES, YOU'VE
BEEN WORKING SO HARD,

30:21.946 --> 30:23.156
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SOME HELP.

30:23.323 --> 30:25.825
YEAH. YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING TOO HARD.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.452
WELL, IT WON'T BE
FOR MUCH LONGER.

30:27.619 --> 30:28.620
GOING TO SLEEPY EYE
AGAIN TODAY, PA?

30:28.786 --> 30:30.413
NO. AFTER I GET DONE
AT THE MILL,

30:30.580 --> 30:32.916
I'M GOING TO GO OVER AND DO SOME
WORK AT THE WIDOW THURMOND'S.

30:33.082 --> 30:33.875
YOU ARE?

30:34.042 --> 30:35.126
MM-HMM.

30:35.293 --> 30:36.961
HEY, THERE'S SOME NICE ONES
DOWN BY THE RIVER.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.136
ENOUGH MUSHROOMS HERE
TO LAST A WHOLE YEAR.

30:47.180 --> 30:50.058
MARY'S DOING SOME WORK
FOR THE WIDOW THURMOND.

30:50.225 --> 30:52.602
MRS. WHIPPLE
HAS ME SEWING A DRESS FOR HER.

30:52.769 --> 30:54.187
WELL,
DO A GOOD JOB ON IT.

30:54.354 --> 30:55.772
WIDOW THURMOND'S
A NICE LADY.

30:55.939 --> 30:56.981
IT'S AWFUL HARD
TO SEW FOR SOMEONE

30:57.148 --> 30:59.359
WHO DOESN'T HAVE
A VERY GOOD FIGURE.

30:59.526 --> 31:01.110
IT MAY LOOK LIKE SHE'S
WEARING CRINOLINES,

31:01.277 --> 31:04.072
BUT THAT'S REALLY HER
UNDER THE SKIRT.

31:04.239 --> 31:05.698
WELL, YOU JUST DO
THE BEST YOU CAN.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.992
I'M SURE SHE'S PAYING MRS.
WHIPPLE A LOT OF MONEY.

31:11.162 --> 31:14.707
I WONDER IF IT'S AS MUCH
AS SHE PAID FOR HER TEETH.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.167
WHAT?

31:16.334 --> 31:18.795
WELL, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WIDOWS
WEAR STORE-BOUGHTEN TEETH,

31:18.962 --> 31:20.004
AND THEY COME OUT
AT NIGHT.

31:20.171 --> 31:21.589
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
THAT, YOUNG LADY,

31:21.756 --> 31:23.216
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A
VERY NICE THING TO SAY.

31:23.383 --> 31:26.344
YOU COULD HURT
SOMEBODY'S FEELINGS.

31:26.511 --> 31:29.514
WE GOT ENOUGH MUSHROOMS.
YOU WANT A RIDE TO SCHOOL?

31:29.681 --> 31:31.724
NO. WE'LL WALK.

31:31.891 --> 31:35.186
YEAH. WE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME.

31:35.353 --> 31:37.689
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT TO GET GOING.

31:37.855 --> 31:38.690
SEE YOU AT SUPPER.

31:38.856 --> 31:39.983
Mary: SEE YOU.

31:43.111 --> 31:44.571
I DON'T THINK
IT WORKED.

31:44.737 --> 31:47.699
THEN WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.701
COME ON. LET'S GO.

31:53.371 --> 31:55.456
WE'VE GOT TO THINK
OF SOMETHING.

31:55.623 --> 31:56.666
I'M TRYING.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.002
I WISH WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

31:59.168 --> 32:00.044
WHY?

32:00.211 --> 32:02.171
IT'S TOO HARD
TO THINK IN SCHOOL.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.716
THAT'S SILLY. YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO THINK IN SCHOOL.

32:04.882 --> 32:06.050
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN.

32:06.217 --> 32:07.176
HEY, DO YOU
HAVE TO WORK

32:07.343 --> 32:08.970
AT MRS. WHIPPLE'S
AFTER SCHOOL?

32:09.137 --> 32:11.848
SURE. ON THAT
WIDOW THURMOND'S DRESS.

32:12.015 --> 32:14.892
GREAT. THAT'S JUST
THE EXCUSE WE NEED.

32:15.059 --> 32:16.728
EXCUSE? FOR WHAT?

32:16.894 --> 32:18.396
FOR GOING TO
THE WIDOW'S WEB.

32:25.194 --> 32:26.279
WHOA.

32:36.664 --> 32:37.957
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

32:58.394 --> 33:00.396
Laura: CAN YOU
SEE ANYTHING?

33:00.563 --> 33:02.273
NO.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.400
SHOULD WE WAIT?

33:04.567 --> 33:07.612
NO. WE'D BETTER DO IT NOW
BEFORE I LOSE MY NERVE.

33:42.897 --> 33:45.233
WELL, HELLO,
MARY, LAURA.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.777
MRS. THURMOND, MRS. WHIPPLE
SENT ME BY TO FIT THE SKIRT.

33:47.944 --> 33:49.737
OH, WELL, I DON'T
KNOW JUST NOW.--

33:49.904 --> 33:53.491
WELL, I'M GOING TO HELP HER,
SO IT WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

33:53.658 --> 33:54.909
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON IN.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.163
THIS WAY.

34:10.842 --> 34:13.678
LAURA, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE
PINS AND TACK IT TOGETHER

34:13.845 --> 34:15.054
AND I'LL HOLD IT UP.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.682
ISN'T IT CUSTOMARY
TO BASTE THE DRESS TOGETHER

34:17.849 --> 34:19.016
BEFORE YOU FIT IT?

34:19.183 --> 34:19.892
UH...

34:20.059 --> 34:21.602
THIS NEW WAY'S
FASTER.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.187
IT SAVES MAKING
MISTAKES LATER.

34:23.354 --> 34:24.439
OH.

34:24.605 --> 34:28.359
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PULL OUT THE STITCHES.

34:28.526 --> 34:31.112
[HUMMING]

34:31.279 --> 34:33.531
Laura: THE EDGE
IS UNEVEN.

34:33.698 --> 34:35.074
Mary: A LITTLE MORE
OVER HERE.

34:35.241 --> 34:36.033
THERE.

34:36.200 --> 34:39.662
YEAH. LOOKS
JUST ABOUT RIGHT.

34:39.829 --> 34:41.664
Charles: HI, GIRLS. UH!

34:41.831 --> 34:45.209
CAREFUL WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE PINS.
MIND YOU DON'T STICK MRS. THURMOND.

34:45.376 --> 34:47.754
OH, SHE'S BEEN DOING
QUITE WELL SO FAR.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.757
PA, WHERE'D YOU
COME FROM?

34:50.923 --> 34:54.218
WELL, I JUST TOLD YOU,
BE CAREFUL WITH THE PINS.

34:54.385 --> 34:55.261
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I NEVER SAW YOUR MA

34:55.428 --> 34:57.263
DO A FITTING LIKE THAT.

34:57.430 --> 34:59.557
UH, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:59.724 --> 35:01.476
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT'S GOING TO WORK.

35:01.642 --> 35:02.727
I GUESS
MRS. WHIPPLE'S IDEA

35:02.894 --> 35:05.730
WASN'T SUCH A GOOD
IDEA AFTER ALL.

35:05.897 --> 35:07.273
JUST HAVE TO BASTE IT.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.275
WELL, I HAVE A NEEDLE AND THREAD.
WE COULD DO IT RIGHT NOW.

35:09.442 --> 35:11.444
NOW, HOLD ON A MINUTE. THIS
IS VERY EXPENSIVE MATERIAL.

35:11.611 --> 35:13.362
I THINK YOU BETTER CHECK WITH MRS.
WHIPPLE FIRST.

35:13.529 --> 35:14.739
YES. I APPRECIATE
YOUR EFFORTS, GIRLS,

35:14.906 --> 35:17.283
BUT I THINK YOUR
FATHER'S RIGHT.

35:17.450 --> 35:18.242
PA...

35:18.409 --> 35:19.202
HMM?

35:19.368 --> 35:21.245
IT'S SUCH
A LONG WALK BACK.

35:21.412 --> 35:24.081
YOU WOULDN'T BE LEAVING
NOW, WOULD YOU?

IT DOESN'T MATTER.

39:11.017 --> 39:12.435
YOUR PA'S
BEEN REAL BUSY.

39:15.146 --> 39:16.814
IT'S JUST A BLOUSE.

39:19.483 --> 39:21.277

TO SERVE IN, ANYWAY.

39:37.668 --> 39:39.295
[WHISPERING] What are
you thinking about?

39:39.462 --> 39:42.673
I was just thinking about how sad
Ma looked at supper tonight.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.552
Yeah. She hardly
said anything.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.806
Maybe Pa was
too tired to notice.

39:50.973 --> 39:53.976
Didn't look tired
to me.

39:54.143 --> 39:55.269
Not to me either.

39:57.021 --> 39:58.022
IF I WAS MA, I'D GO--

39:58.189 --> 40:00.357
Shh! They're
right downstairs.

40:00.524 --> 40:02.526
If I was Ma, I'd go right
over to that Mrs. Thurmond's

40:02.693 --> 40:05.404
and punch her
in the stomach.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.031
Ma couldn't do that.

40:07.198 --> 40:10.409
Why not? I bet you if it was
reversed, Pa would do it.

40:10.576 --> 40:14.997
He'd punch anybody that tried
to work their wiles on Ma.

40:15.164 --> 40:17.875
Well,
that's different.

40:18.042 --> 40:18.876
Why?

40:19.043 --> 40:20.544
Because Pa's a man.

40:20.711 --> 40:22.046
So?

40:22.213 --> 40:25.716
So it's different. Men are
supposed to fight for women.

40:25.883 --> 40:28.094
What are women
supposed to do?

40:28.260 --> 40:30.387
Well, I don't know,

40:30.554 --> 40:32.223
but men and women
are just different.

40:32.389 --> 40:33.432
I know
they're different.

40:33.599 --> 40:34.725
I've seen
our mare birthing.

40:34.892 --> 40:36.602
But men and women
both have stomachs,

40:36.769 --> 40:39.939
and I think Ma should punch Mrs.
Thurmond's.

40:40.106 --> 40:41.857

UP THERE?
