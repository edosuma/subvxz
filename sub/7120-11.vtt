Hour six of our Ice
Kingdom stakeout.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.036
Abso-nothing's going on there.

00:17.106 --> 00:20.732
And if I do this
hand position...

00:20.806 --> 00:22.999
My boogers should turn
into smoke bombs.

00:23.072 --> 00:23.902
Pbht!

00:23.972 --> 00:25.962
You sure this tip
is good, Flambo?

00:26.038 --> 00:26.868
Come on.

00:26.938 --> 00:28.529
You know I'm on the level!

00:28.605 --> 00:30.572
The Ice King is scheming to nabs

00:30.637 --> 00:31.763
a Princess today!

00:31.837 --> 00:32.701
I swears it!

00:32.771 --> 00:33.601
Hm.

00:33.670 --> 00:35.398
Relax, restless-pants.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.936
A true Ninja can sense the

00:37.003 --> 00:38.970
intentions of his enemies. Jin!

00:39.036 --> 00:40.434
Ninjas.

00:40.503 --> 00:42.935
Ninjas ain't real
for nothin', nohow.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.128
Whoa, now.

00:44.202 --> 00:45.395
Ninjas <i>are</i> real.

00:45.468 --> 00:46.526
For, you see...

00:46.602 --> 00:48.432
♪ Do-do-do! ♪

00:48.502 --> 00:50.025
Jake and I <i>are</i> Ninjas.

00:50.101 --> 00:50.965
Yep.

00:51.034 --> 00:52.863
Ever since we fished this Ninja

00:52.933 --> 00:54.298
manual out of a ditch.

00:54.367 --> 00:56.799
Finn, booty me!

00:56.867 --> 00:58.766
Wenk.

00:58.832 --> 00:59.663
Listen!

00:59.732 --> 01:00.732
Wenk, wenk, wenk.

01:00.766 --> 01:02.199
Finn, I think I'm gonna

01:02.265 --> 01:03.197
take off my booties.

01:03.265 --> 01:06.198
I can't flip these pages.

01:06.265 --> 01:07.629
Ho-ho!

01:07.698 --> 01:09.187
Oh, Gunter, let's go.

01:09.264 --> 01:11.821
I've got the overnight bag.

01:11.897 --> 01:12.727
Wenk, wenk!

01:12.797 --> 01:14.354
It's the Ice King, all right,

01:14.430 --> 01:15.897
and he's looking awful

01:15.963 --> 01:17.089
pleased with himself.

01:17.163 --> 01:17.993
Uh-oh.

01:18.063 --> 01:19.586
If the Ice King's so happy, he

01:19.662 --> 01:21.253
must have stolen a Princess when

01:21.329 --> 01:22.920
we weren't looking somehow.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.189
That's Ninja logic.

01:24.262 --> 01:27.854
Then we got to... - Ahem.

01:27.927 --> 01:30.360
We got to save that Princess.

01:30.428 --> 01:32.656
You got it, Shino-bro.

01:32.727 --> 01:33.659
Ninja kick.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.727
Ninja kick.

01:38.292 --> 01:40.781
Princess? Princess?

01:43.658 --> 01:44.590
Princess?

01:44.658 --> 01:46.249
Princess?!

01:46.325 --> 01:48.689
Princess?! Uh...

01:48.758 --> 01:50.622
No Princess here, man.

01:50.691 --> 01:52.487
No Princess?

01:53.556 --> 01:54.420
It's... A trap.

01:54.490 --> 01:55.582
We're being trapped!

01:55.656 --> 01:56.486
Ninja vanish!

01:56.556 --> 01:57.386
Evade, evade!

01:57.456 --> 01:59.480
Nothing is trapped, dude.

01:59.555 --> 02:01.022
We can't find any captured

02:01.089 --> 02:02.749
Princesses because the Ice King

02:02.822 --> 02:04.186
hasn't captured one yet.

02:04.255 --> 02:05.949
He's out doing it right now.

02:06.021 --> 02:07.419
Are you sure?

02:07.488 --> 02:08.318
No.

02:08.388 --> 02:10.217
It's only a Ninja hunch, so we

02:10.287 --> 02:14.083
should Ninja snoop for proof.

02:14.153 --> 02:15.085
Wait, man.

02:15.153 --> 02:16.279
I-I'd feel uncomfortable

02:16.353 --> 02:18.615
snooping through the Ice
King's personal stuff.

02:18.686 --> 02:20.277
It feels sort of like...

02:20.352 --> 02:22.580
A violation.

02:22.651 --> 02:24.243
Gah! Whoo!

02:24.318 --> 02:25.580
Got the Ice King's diary.

02:25.651 --> 02:27.049
No, no, no, no, no.

02:27.118 --> 02:28.641
We can't read his private junk.

02:28.717 --> 02:30.014
And yet we must.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.547
"Dear diary, and you better

02:33.617 --> 02:35.140
write me back this time.

02:35.217 --> 02:36.877
Today, I'm bringing home a

02:36.950 --> 02:38.211
special new cutie."

02:38.282 --> 02:40.272
There's our proof, man!

02:40.349 --> 02:41.406
Hmm. All right.

02:41.482 --> 02:43.415
Let's use our Ninja stealth and

02:43.482 --> 02:46.039
hide until he comes
back with the Princess.

02:47.014 --> 02:48.446
Or we could keep

02:48.514 --> 02:50.242
looking through his stuff...

02:50.314 --> 02:52.213
You know, for more proof.
He-he-he!

02:52.280 --> 02:53.110
No.

02:53.180 --> 02:54.908
Alls we're gonna do is lie in

02:54.980 --> 02:57.071
wait until the Ice
King gets back.

02:57.146 --> 02:58.669
Then... boom! We catch him

02:58.746 --> 03:00.212
with Princess on his hands.

03:03.412 --> 03:05.276
Where are we gonna hide?

03:05.344 --> 03:06.936
In this filthy hamper!

03:12.310 --> 03:14.004
Think he's there yet?

03:18.876 --> 03:19.876
See anything?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.670
Nah. Hey, Finn, I
don't want to hide

03:21.742 --> 03:22.834
in the hamper anymore.

03:22.908 --> 03:23.806
It reeks in here.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.341
But we're Ninjas, and

03:25.408 --> 03:26.704
this is our Ninja hideout.

03:26.774 --> 03:27.774
Nah, man.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.296
My sense of smell is like 1,000

03:29.374 --> 03:30.773
times better than yours.

03:30.841 --> 03:33.103
Also, the hamper's boring.
I'm out.

03:33.173 --> 03:34.071
Wait!

03:34.140 --> 03:36.106
I'm out!

03:36.172 --> 03:39.162
Jake! Get back here!

03:41.005 --> 03:42.062
Hey, wait up!

03:43.904 --> 03:45.803
Check this out.

03:52.403 --> 03:53.301
Weird.

03:53.370 --> 03:55.360
I want to draw something.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.664
Hey, we got to leave no trace.

03:57.736 --> 03:58.964
Ninjas leave no trace.

03:59.036 --> 04:00.662
I'll delete it after.

04:00.736 --> 04:01.963
Hey, come on!

04:06.735 --> 04:08.667
Jake, what have we done?

04:08.734 --> 04:09.564
Aah!

04:09.633 --> 04:13.066
A secret hidden room
full of Ninja stuff!

04:18.466 --> 04:20.365
Oh, great. A line.

04:20.432 --> 04:22.557
Excuse me. Pardon me.

04:22.631 --> 04:24.689
Uh... I-I think you were

04:24.765 --> 04:26.492
actually... Ahead of me.

04:26.564 --> 04:28.588
You know I was.

04:29.597 --> 04:31.587
Counter maid, I demand medicinal

04:31.663 --> 04:33.687
attentions...
Preferably those of

04:33.763 --> 04:34.889
a Princessy type.

04:34.963 --> 04:36.895
And are you checking in as a

04:36.962 --> 04:38.259
patient or a cadaver?

04:38.329 --> 04:39.420
Hey!

04:39.495 --> 04:41.223
I'm as healthy as 10 old men!

04:41.295 --> 04:42.227
Wenk, wenk.

04:42.295 --> 04:43.387
Huh?

04:43.462 --> 04:45.019
Oh, oh, right. My penguin.

04:45.095 --> 04:46.118
He's very, very sick.

04:47.094 --> 04:49.560
So, what time does
your shift end?

04:49.626 --> 04:51.218
What kind of guy builds

04:51.293 --> 04:53.283
a cave inside of another cave?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.826
What's this? A spell book?

04:54.892 --> 04:55.722
Whoo!

04:55.792 --> 04:57.816
Dude! Leave no trace.

04:57.892 --> 05:00.484
Ah, it's too late for that.

05:00.559 --> 05:02.752
It's not too... Late.

05:02.825 --> 05:04.416
Whoa!

05:04.491 --> 05:05.980
What you got there?

05:06.057 --> 05:06.887
Dude!

05:06.957 --> 05:09.117
It's a First-Edition
Ice Ninja manual.

05:11.090 --> 05:13.421
"True Ninja passes no wind.

05:13.489 --> 05:14.649
He only passes..."

05:17.289 --> 05:20.256
I ain't even heard
of these techniques.

05:20.321 --> 05:24.811
Nuh-nuh-n-numm-nuh...
numb-chucks.

05:24.887 --> 05:26.979
Hey, Ice King seems way

05:27.054 --> 05:29.543
into Ninjas, even
more than we are.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.416
Yeah. So? Oof!

05:31.486 --> 05:33.146
So, doesn't that mean

05:33.219 --> 05:35.118
that Ninjas must
be kind of lame?

05:35.186 --> 05:36.652
Nah, they're still cool,

05:36.719 --> 05:38.345
but Ice King's still lame

05:38.418 --> 05:40.044
because he hides his Ninja love.

05:40.118 --> 05:42.584
We wear our Ninja on our sleeve!

05:42.651 --> 05:44.277
Jake!

05:44.351 --> 05:46.943
Show me how to do that.

05:47.017 --> 05:49.314
What's taking that
doctor so long?!

05:49.383 --> 05:50.543
Gunter, make more noise.

05:51.717 --> 05:53.616
Yeah, all right, all right.

05:53.682 --> 05:55.081
Don't oversell it, Drama Queen.

05:55.149 --> 05:56.149
Dun-dun-dun!

05:56.215 --> 05:57.512
Pardon the intrusion.

05:57.582 --> 05:58.674
I'm Dr. Princess.

05:58.749 --> 05:59.840
Yes.

05:59.915 --> 06:00.779
Well, uh...

06:00.848 --> 06:03.337
come to Ice King, Princess.

06:03.414 --> 06:04.346
Don't worry, Sir.

06:04.414 --> 06:06.505
I specialize in treating
little tuxedo people.

06:06.580 --> 06:07.945
Just give it to me
straight, Doc...

06:08.014 --> 06:09.912
Am I gonna have to pay for this?

06:09.979 --> 06:10.809
Hmm.

06:10.879 --> 06:11.743
Wenk, wenk.

06:11.813 --> 06:13.110
Wenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk.

06:13.180 --> 06:14.010
Oh, my.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.410
What can you do for him, Dr.
Princess?

06:17.479 --> 06:20.411
Without Gunter,
I'll be all alone.

06:20.478 --> 06:22.411
You see, I'm a widower.

06:22.478 --> 06:24.001
Oh. I'm sorry.

06:24.078 --> 06:25.942
How did your wife die?

06:26.011 --> 06:27.375
Oh, uh, what?

06:27.444 --> 06:28.740
Is that what that means?

06:29.710 --> 06:30.608
Whoa, Nellie!

06:30.676 --> 06:32.700
Something... Medical
is happening.

06:32.776 --> 06:33.606
Wenk!

06:33.676 --> 06:36.268
Gunter, you're embarrassing me!

06:37.975 --> 06:39.941
Frigidtsu Master Finn summons...

06:40.008 --> 06:42.474
Dagger of chilled glass.

06:42.541 --> 06:44.508
Frigidtsu Master Jake summons...

06:44.574 --> 06:47.802
Stars of frozen rain.

06:47.873 --> 06:49.840
Get ready to be... Star-struck.

06:49.907 --> 06:52.032
Get ready to be...

06:52.106 --> 06:53.106
Cold-cut.

06:56.872 --> 06:57.929
Hyah!

06:58.905 --> 07:00.428
Kunai attack!

07:02.005 --> 07:03.403
Icicle kick!

07:05.338 --> 07:07.304
Force of blizzard!

07:08.936 --> 07:10.301
Flying jump!

07:11.869 --> 07:13.563
What?! Three Jakes?

07:13.636 --> 07:15.626
That's one too many.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.363
Caltrop hailstorm!

07:19.768 --> 07:21.564
Those Jakes were all fakes!

07:21.635 --> 07:22.566
Ha!

07:22.634 --> 07:24.863
Frigidtsu Master Jake summons...

07:24.934 --> 07:26.400
Arrow of ice!

07:28.267 --> 07:29.631
Hyah!

07:29.700 --> 07:30.530
Rad!

07:30.599 --> 07:33.031
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

07:37.165 --> 07:38.655
It's the Ice King.

07:38.732 --> 07:39.629
Hide!

07:39.698 --> 07:41.790
♪ Do-do-do-do ♪

07:41.864 --> 07:43.330
♪ Ay-yoo-hoo-hoo ♪

07:43.397 --> 07:45.591
Okay, my dear, this enclosure

07:45.663 --> 07:47.357
will be your new home.

07:47.430 --> 07:49.624
He's got a Princess.

07:49.697 --> 07:53.289
Now we leap out, catch
him red-handed.

07:53.362 --> 07:54.192
Hai!

07:54.262 --> 07:55.262
Snow-blind!

07:55.295 --> 07:57.387
Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice.

07:57.462 --> 07:59.053
But once you get

07:59.128 --> 08:00.685
used to the smell
of penguin manure,

08:00.761 --> 08:02.352
it's almost tolerable.

08:02.428 --> 08:03.292
Hyah!

08:03.361 --> 08:05.850
Ice King, hand over
that Princess!

08:05.927 --> 08:06.791
Hyah!

08:06.860 --> 08:08.417
Princess? What?

08:08.493 --> 08:10.652
Jake, where's the Princess?

08:10.726 --> 08:11.886
Ooh, right.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.448
What Princess?

08:13.526 --> 08:16.357
The, um, Princess you
were just talking to.

08:16.425 --> 08:19.949
Yeah, the one you just
came back from <i>stealing.</i>

08:20.024 --> 08:21.615
Wrong-o.

08:21.691 --> 08:23.783
I was at the hospital,

08:23.857 --> 08:26.687
for it turns out Gunter
here was preggers!

08:26.756 --> 08:27.586
Wenk.

08:27.656 --> 08:30.213
I was just talking to the egg.

08:30.289 --> 08:31.415
It's such a cutie.

08:31.489 --> 08:33.115
Gunter's a woman?!

08:33.188 --> 08:36.678
What? No. Huh.

08:36.755 --> 08:38.448
Anyway, get out of my house or

08:38.522 --> 08:39.953
I'll kill you, et cetera.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.885
I want to take a nap
in my easy chair.

08:41.953 --> 08:42.784
Aah!

08:42.854 --> 08:44.320
What happened to my recliner?!

08:44.387 --> 08:45.217
Oh.

08:45.287 --> 08:46.878
My skins and tubs!

08:48.486 --> 08:51.452
You even violated
my secret sanctum?!

08:51.519 --> 08:53.247
What is wrong with you?

08:53.319 --> 08:54.945
No Princess?

08:55.018 --> 08:57.110
No. No Princess.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.049
We messed up, Jake.

08:59.117 --> 09:01.448
We're... Violators.

09:01.518 --> 09:02.711
Yeah, what the heck?

09:02.784 --> 09:03.614
You think you can just wreck my

09:03.684 --> 09:05.878
house and wear my collectibles?

09:06.849 --> 09:08.248
Who do you guys think you are?

09:08.317 --> 09:10.045
We're... Ninjas?

09:10.116 --> 09:11.742
You're not Ninjas.

09:11.816 --> 09:14.009
You're just a couple of jerks!

09:14.082 --> 09:15.242
It's true.

09:15.316 --> 09:18.407
Ice King, we're gonna
make this right.

09:18.481 --> 09:19.504
Yeah, do it.

09:19.581 --> 09:20.512
Make it right.

09:20.580 --> 09:23.046
Start by, uh... oh, take my bag

09:23.113 --> 09:24.943
over to the cage.

09:30.179 --> 09:31.043
Oh, no, no, no!

09:31.112 --> 09:32.010
Not that. Never mind.

09:32.079 --> 09:33.511
Uh, put that down and go clean

09:33.578 --> 09:35.442
my gym equipment.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.544
Dr. Princess!

09:39.611 --> 09:41.134
Oh.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.302
I have no idea how
<i>that</i> got in there.

09:43.377 --> 09:44.741
What's going on?

09:44.810 --> 09:46.072
I'll field that one.

09:46.143 --> 09:47.804
The Ice King abducted me while I

09:47.876 --> 09:49.775
was distracted by the horrifying

09:49.842 --> 09:51.070
beauty of birth.

09:53.142 --> 09:54.268
Yes.

09:54.342 --> 09:56.275
Gunter's ailment was the perfect

09:56.342 --> 09:57.638
cover for stealing a

09:57.708 --> 09:58.640
Princess M.D.

09:58.708 --> 10:00.640
I'm not even a real Princess.

10:00.707 --> 10:02.072
Princess is just a surname.

10:02.141 --> 10:03.937
Enough! You may
have uncovered my

10:04.007 --> 10:05.564
Princess-smuggling scheme,

10:05.640 --> 10:09.868
but you'll never leave
this place alive!

10:09.939 --> 10:11.371
Ha ha!

10:11.439 --> 10:12.303
A couple of Ninjas like me and

10:12.372 --> 10:14.134
Finn can only be defeated by
