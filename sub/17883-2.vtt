WEBVTT

00:22.228 --> 00:25.191
Just four hours
of my time gone in a gobble?

00:25.192 --> 00:26.317
Hey, hey. What's up?

00:26.318 --> 00:28.817
Hey.

00:28.818 --> 00:29.851
Hey.

00:29.852 --> 00:31.656
What up?

00:31.657 --> 00:34.022
Oh. Well, look at that.

00:34.023 --> 00:36.140
5 past 9:00. Off to work.

00:39.163 --> 00:41.541
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm, mmm!

00:41.542 --> 00:44.148
My God.
I'm having a <i>mouthgasm.</i>

00:44.149 --> 00:46.534
Actually, the chocolate is
flooding your brain

00:46.535 --> 00:48.203
with serotonin,
which gives you

00:48.204 --> 00:50.467
the same sensation
as a sexual release...

00:50.468 --> 00:53.094
Ricky, you're ruining this
for me.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.710
How can knowledge ruin anything?

00:55.711 --> 00:57.849
Wait. What? Everybody got one
of Molly's cupcakes?

00:57.850 --> 00:59.726
These are Molly's?

00:59.727 --> 01:00.977
Whoa!

01:00.978 --> 01:02.562
Ohh. I would have
eaten that.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.852
Are you gonna let
that stuffy corporate cog

01:03.853 --> 01:05.220
butter cream you up?

01:05.221 --> 01:07.689
Oh. I see what this is...
A little...

01:07.690 --> 01:09.074
♪ Jealousy. ♪

01:09.075 --> 01:11.793
♪ someone doesn't like that
there's another office hottie ♪

01:11.894 --> 01:13.990
I'm not jealous, okay?

01:13.991 --> 01:15.647
I just don't buy
that whole nice British act.

01:15.648 --> 01:18.912
She's conning you guys
with cupcakes. Wait.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.121
You think she's hot?

01:20.122 --> 01:24.417
She's very...
Symmetrical?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.623
She's slave Leia hot,

01:25.624 --> 01:27.212
chained to Jabba
for his delight.

01:27.213 --> 01:29.631
My hoochie!

01:29.632 --> 01:31.841
Yeah, I'd tap it.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.532
Uh, okay.
Mel, just cut her some slack.

01:34.533 --> 01:36.930
Trust me. It sucks being
the new kid in this office.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.766
I have been nice to the girl
since the moment she walked in.

01:39.767 --> 01:43.258
So sorry. Uh, Veronica's calling
a bit of an impromptu meeting.

01:43.259 --> 01:44.542
If you...

01:44.543 --> 01:45.897
"Uh, so sorry.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.012
"Impromptu meeting.
Pip-pip.

01:48.013 --> 01:51.945
Cheerio. David Beckham."

01:51.946 --> 01:55.573
Uh, hello. Jealousy?

01:56.147 --> 01:59.491
<font color="#00ffff">Original Sync & corrections by Rafael UPD & M3TAL_L0RD</font>
<font color="#00ffff">www.Addic7ed.com/</font>

02:00.579 --> 02:03.873
In my hands, I hold a stack
of beautiful, beautiful money,

02:03.874 --> 02:05.124
and... uh-oh...

02:05.125 --> 02:06.331
I'm making it rain.

02:06.332 --> 02:08.282
Oh.
Oh, look at that.

02:08.283 --> 02:10.088
Um...
Molly, should I be doing this?

02:10.089 --> 02:11.903
Um, no.
And why is that?

02:11.904 --> 02:14.008
Uh, because we're... we're
actually quite broke.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.423
Ah, that is correct.

02:15.424 --> 02:17.845
We are flatlining.
Whoa. Oh.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.180
But I am here to... "Clear!"

02:22.181 --> 02:23.715
Ooh.

02:23.716 --> 02:24.849
We got a heartbeat.

02:24.850 --> 02:26.217
Yay! The company is alive!

02:26.218 --> 02:28.731
Okay, and how will we do it,
you say? Molly?

02:28.732 --> 02:32.485
New clients, and Contra is
in desperate need of some.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.280
Great news on that front, ladies.
I just landed us a doozy.

02:35.281 --> 02:37.490
And how much money
does it pay, dare I ask?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.898
Well, to be perfectly honest
with you, it is a pro Bono gig,

02:39.899 --> 02:42.078
- but there are certain hidden benefits.
- I'll pass.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.621
- I think you should hear me out.
- Pass.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.998
There's somebody there
that I would love for you...

02:44.999 --> 02:46.604
Paso doble.
Mm.

02:46.605 --> 02:49.791
Now I do have a very long list
of rich potential clients,

02:49.792 --> 02:52.088
but I'm not gonna bore you
with that right now.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.128
Molly's going to.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.632
Ciao, lovers.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.343
Who here likes going
to Las Vegas?!

02:57.344 --> 02:58.633
Oh, dude.
Yeah!

02:58.634 --> 02:59.721
Vegas, what?

02:59.722 --> 03:01.118
Excellent, because...

03:01.119 --> 03:03.254
Halfway to Vegas is...

03:03.255 --> 03:07.103
The Crazy Horse Indian casino
and leather boot emporium.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.438
Ohh!

03:08.439 --> 03:10.311
They are having
major security issues

03:10.312 --> 03:12.650
and need our magic touch.

03:14.132 --> 03:17.268
Well, we are gonna kick
the butt out of this job!

03:17.269 --> 03:20.366
I'm gonna put
some of my best men on it.

03:25.245 --> 03:26.411
Oh, look.
There's some chi over there.

03:26.412 --> 03:28.875
Let me pull it back
with my big rope.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.315
Oh, no.
Oh, what's happening?

03:31.316 --> 03:32.750
Mei wei,
I'm stuck in a box!

03:34.086 --> 03:36.337
Terribly sorry to interrupt
your tai chi lesson.

03:36.338 --> 03:37.842
I've noticed that
everyone in the office

03:37.843 --> 03:40.157
is now looking to Oz
for directions

03:40.158 --> 03:42.159
instead of you,
and he's developed this...

03:42.160 --> 03:44.307
This secret code of sorts.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.600
Excuse me, chaps.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.265
Uh, Veronica's requested
that you have

03:47.266 --> 03:49.020
a staggered feeding schedule.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.481
That means you both can't go
to lunch at the same time.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.485
<i>This</i> means
ignore what you're saying.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.725
Per Veronica,
no more pornography

03:57.726 --> 03:59.644
on your work computers.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.493
<i>This</i> means
he agrees with you.

04:03.494 --> 04:05.567
I'd like you to alphabetize
all of your receipts.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.821
And when he taps his chin,
it means "Molly sucks."

04:09.822 --> 04:11.739
You know, I may not look
like it right now

04:11.740 --> 04:14.158
because I'm
in my special chi place,

04:14.159 --> 04:17.128
but I'm actually
uber pissed off.

04:17.129 --> 04:19.214
Well, I thought maybe
I could arrange a meeting,

04:19.214 --> 04:20.882
um, so you could nip
this whole thing

04:20.882 --> 04:21.928
in the bud.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.721
I have an even better idea.

04:23.722 --> 04:27.934
How about a fun little game
of good cop, bad cop?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.353
And unless you want to lose
your jobs,

04:30.354 --> 04:33.731
there will be an immediate stop
to all taps, rubs, and tugs.

04:35.764 --> 04:39.362
And no more of that.
I do not suck.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.019
Personally, I am very impressed
that you figured out

04:41.020 --> 04:42.448
my little Da Vinci code.
I mean, how did you do it?

04:42.449 --> 04:44.689
Oh, well, I-I have this, um,

04:44.690 --> 04:47.704
this whole
hyperattentive brain thingy.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.998
Come on, Waldo.
Where are you, brotha?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.375
Oh. He's there.

04:53.322 --> 04:54.535
And there.

04:55.417 --> 04:56.462
And there and there.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.923
And I bought this for me!

04:58.924 --> 05:00.922
Anyway, the point is,
Veronica is now

05:00.923 --> 05:02.969
the only authority
in this office.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.138
Oh, my God.
Is bad cop almost done?

05:05.139 --> 05:07.244
V., I just want to say,
from the bottom of my heart,

05:07.245 --> 05:09.297
that I am very, <i>very</i> sorry

05:09.298 --> 05:10.715
that we got caught.

05:10.716 --> 05:12.917
From this point forward,
<i>anything</i> that happens

05:12.918 --> 05:15.937
in this office I am going to run right
through you.

05:15.938 --> 05:16.971
It's here. It's here.

05:16.972 --> 05:18.606
It's here!

05:18.607 --> 05:20.775
220 brilliant-cut diamonds,

05:20.776 --> 05:25.149
hand-sewn onto a buxomy 32c
dramatic-lift demi brassiere.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.284
Ohh.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.744
He's a regular <i>bra-fficianado.</i>

05:27.745 --> 05:29.495
Ask him anything.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.435
Uh, have you ever seen one
on an actual woman?

05:32.871 --> 05:34.605
This is the pro bono case
I was telling you about.

05:34.606 --> 05:36.624
Every year,
"Maxim" magazine hires us

05:36.625 --> 05:39.043
to protect their million-dollar
diamond boob sling

05:39.044 --> 05:40.339
at their annual event.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.713
Just sounds like
gobs of fun.

05:41.714 --> 05:43.131
- Yeah?
- Bad cop.

05:43.132 --> 05:46.501
Uh, yes, as I believe we covered
earlier in the meeting...

05:46.502 --> 05:47.635
If we're not getting paid,

05:47.636 --> 05:49.682
then we're not taking
the job.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.123
Oh, who cares? We're gonna have
the <i>breast</i> time.

05:52.124 --> 05:56.844
"The breast time"!
Oh, my God. So, so hilarious.

05:56.845 --> 05:58.012
Bad cop.

05:58.013 --> 05:59.192
Yeah, we still can't take
the job.

06:00.766 --> 06:02.934
Yeah. Captain bummer over here,
right?  She's...

06:02.935 --> 06:06.032
The top rung of the ladder
has spoken.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.075
We are not going to do
this job.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.869
- You know what? Come on, Oz.
- We need this! Come on, man.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.110
No, no! No secret signals.
I am not touching my nose.

06:12.111 --> 06:16.080
I am no longer in charge.

06:25.958 --> 06:27.342
Hmm-hmm.

06:29.268 --> 06:31.598
Oh, I can't wait to go
to this party tonight.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.391
There's gonna be
so many models there!

06:33.392 --> 06:34.700
I need another slice.

06:34.701 --> 06:36.169
No, hey, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

06:36.170 --> 06:39.397
Rickey Borten's over there,
and dude is a talker.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.591
The last thing you want to get
caught up in is the <i>bortex.</i>

06:41.592 --> 06:43.176
But it's the lattice crust
that makes this

06:43.177 --> 06:45.094
a classic Dutch-style apple pie.

06:45.095 --> 06:46.712
It's got nothing to do
with the apples.

06:46.713 --> 06:48.497
- I mean, Dutch apples...
- They don't exist.

06:48.498 --> 06:49.832
It's a total fallacy.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.333
Just let me enjoy this,
please.

06:51.334 --> 06:53.438
You <i>should</i> be enjoying it,
because this is a really...

06:53.439 --> 06:54.704
What's up, boys?

06:54.705 --> 06:57.023
I see you're diggin'
my handiwork.

06:57.024 --> 06:59.142
- <i>You</i> made this?
- Yep.

06:59.143 --> 07:02.587
Wow. It's so flaky
and competent.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.947
- Why do you sound so surprised?
- Because you can't cook.

07:04.948 --> 07:06.682
You use your stove
to light cigarettes.

07:06.683 --> 07:10.620
You, <i>missy,</i>
have broken into my car

07:10.621 --> 07:14.624
and burgled those pies,
you... you pie burglar.

07:14.625 --> 07:17.043
- And there it is.
- Slow your roll, Pippa.

07:17.044 --> 07:18.527
No one here knows
what you're talking about.

07:18.528 --> 07:20.546
I have read your file.

07:20.547 --> 07:22.274
I know you come
from thief blood.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.776
Said the nark
who ratted us out

07:24.777 --> 07:26.419
and told Veronica
about our secret code.

07:26.420 --> 07:29.739
I am just trying
to do my job,

07:29.740 --> 07:32.325
but if you all
blatantly break the rules,

07:32.326 --> 07:34.202
then I have to let
Veronica know.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.846
Well...
Then I guess we won't be

07:36.847 --> 07:38.999
so blatant about it, huh?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.852
My mummy's Timex!

07:42.853 --> 07:44.187
Pip-pip. Cheerio.

07:44.188 --> 07:45.221
God save the queen.

07:45.222 --> 07:46.339
Unbelievable.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.658
I only baked those pies
as a... as a nice gesture

07:48.659 --> 07:50.886
because you all have to work
so late tonight.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.329
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who... who's working late tonight?

07:53.330 --> 07:54.497
Yeah, how late are
we talking...

07:54.498 --> 07:56.115
Like, dinnertime late,
5:00, 5:30 late?

07:56.116 --> 07:58.584
Like, we can leave
and go somewhere else late?

07:58.585 --> 07:59.686
Didn't Veronica tell you?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.688
She's booked
the Indian casino job,

08:01.689 --> 08:05.233
so we have 900 hours
of security footage

08:05.234 --> 08:06.425
to go through.

08:06.426 --> 08:07.910
They think they might have
a card counter,

08:07.911 --> 08:10.780
and your job is
to catch them posthaste.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.915
Sorry Cruella here
is bringing the hammer down.

08:12.916 --> 08:15.601
I-I can't control her.
She's a beast.

08:15.602 --> 08:17.637
But the good news is,
slumber party! Yay!

08:17.638 --> 08:18.638
Oh.
No.

08:18.639 --> 08:19.748
Sounds good.
Wh...

08:19.749 --> 08:21.557
Question, though.
Could we maybe,

08:21.558 --> 08:23.043
I don't know,
do it tomorrow?

08:23.044 --> 08:25.561
Oh, my gosh.
That is such a good idea.

08:25.562 --> 08:26.929
Let me just call
Chief Running Bear

08:26.930 --> 08:28.648
and tell him, "sorry.
The white man has broken"

08:28.649 --> 08:30.432
"yet another promise. Here.

08:30.433 --> 08:32.068
"Let me give you this blanket
riddled with smallpox.

08:32.068 --> 08:34.102
That will make you feel better."
Right?

08:34.104 --> 08:35.304
This guy right here...

08:35.306 --> 08:37.015
He's got a million of 'em.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.224
Yes.
Come on.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.945
The party's tonight.
Man, what are we gonna do?

08:42.946 --> 08:45.690
I don't know.
Call Oz?

08:47.084 --> 08:49.244
Okay. Time to commence secret
meeting of Contra classic.

08:49.745 --> 08:51.420
Now, as you know,
we have two jobs to do

08:51.421 --> 08:53.022
in the exact time
on the exact same night,

08:53.023 --> 08:54.707
which means only one thing.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.142
Yes! Human cloning.
We make doubles of ourselves,

08:57.143 --> 08:58.836
and we make them do
the casino job.

08:58.837 --> 09:01.146
Why do you always go to human cloning?
It's not gonna happen.

09:01.147 --> 09:02.198
Not with that attitude.

09:02.199 --> 09:03.932
Oz, we can't do both jobs.

09:03.933 --> 09:05.100
We'd need
a whole team of people

09:05.101 --> 09:06.678
to get through
all that casino footage.

We want to see booby,
we gotta charm the newbie.

09:16.605 --> 09:18.480
Hey, Molly!
Hey.

09:18.481 --> 09:21.067
That is a nice blouse.

09:21.068 --> 09:25.071
Oh, thank you.
Um, I-I like your Kermie.

09:26.923 --> 09:28.950
Cash, take a breath.
Let it go.

09:28.951 --> 09:32.120
This ain't no sock puppet!
It's Yoda!

09:32.121 --> 09:34.763
I'm sorry.
I-I don't own a telly.

09:34.764 --> 09:36.632
Bitch is crazy.

09:36.633 --> 09:39.068
Swing and a miss.
All right, dimples.

09:39.069 --> 09:40.352
Commence woo.

09:40.353 --> 09:41.705
Yeah, great.
Ohh.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.971
Woo her up.

09:42.972 --> 09:44.740
Take her to dinner,

09:44.741 --> 09:46.884
Fall in love. Good stuff.

09:46.885 --> 09:48.594
What is your problem?

09:48.595 --> 09:49.811

is gonna fall for this.

Whoa. What is her problem?

10:05.545 --> 10:07.263
Ah, don't worry.
She'll be back.

10:07.264 --> 10:08.664
See?

10:10.267 --> 10:12.167
Hey. We heard
you guys are going

10:12.168 --> 10:14.245
to the hot lady party.
We want in.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.855
I'm a foodie. There's gonna be
small plates, man.

10:16.856 --> 10:20.309
Bacon-wrapped figs paired
with wines. Need I go on?

10:20.310 --> 10:22.503
I'm already not wearing
any underwear.

10:22.504 --> 10:25.180
The people have spoken.
You're up, Cameron Mannheim.

10:25.181 --> 10:27.175
Commence John woo.

10:27.176 --> 10:28.651
Me?  Really?

10:28.652 --> 10:30.119
Yeah.
You want me?

10:30.120 --> 10:31.537
We all think you'd be
a great addition to the team.

10:31.538 --> 10:33.238
Oh, this is so unexpected.

10:33.239 --> 10:35.190
I mean, I was beginning
to fear perhaps

10:35.191 --> 10:36.292
you weren't fond of me.

10:36.293 --> 10:37.376
Hey, there's
the new recruit!

10:37.377 --> 10:38.377
Got your pepper spray,

10:38.378 --> 10:39.878
your Billy club,

10:39.879 --> 10:41.664
and here's your 9-millimeter
Bobcat...

10:41.665 --> 10:43.066
With laser scope.

10:43.067 --> 10:45.943
Um, I thought we were all
looking at Blackjack footage.

10:45.944 --> 10:47.536
Well, we gotta go in. We gotta
get the lay of the land,

10:47.537 --> 10:49.588
but don't worry about it.
You won't need this hand cannon,

10:49.589 --> 10:52.492
but just in case you do,
don't hit any civvies. They sue.

10:52.493 --> 10:55.711
- Oh.
- And don't forget your proton pack.

10:55.712 --> 10:57.997
Oh. This...
This looks unsafe.

10:57.998 --> 11:01.876
No, you're fine!
Just don't cross the streams.

11:01.877 --> 11:03.503
What happens if you cross
the streams?

11:03.504 --> 11:04.737
All right, easy does it,
Ernie Hudson.

11:04.738 --> 11:06.071
All right.
Well, you guys have fun.

11:06.072 --> 11:07.423
Hit me on the walkie-talkie
if you need me.

11:07.424 --> 11:09.967
Wait!
You're not coming with us?

11:09.968 --> 11:12.244
No. I'll be hanging here,
pouring through

11:12.245 --> 11:14.697
the boring old casino footage,
so...

11:14.698 --> 11:16.248
Someone's gotta do it.

11:16.249 --> 11:17.683
Me!

11:17.684 --> 11:19.284
Me.
Oh.

11:19.285 --> 11:20.812
I'll stay here...
Well...

11:20.813 --> 11:22.647
In the office,
where it's safe.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.239
You see, I-I'm just,
uh, a little bit

11:24.240 --> 11:26.091
of a... of a safety freak.

11:26.092 --> 11:28.127
- You sure?
- Quite.

11:28.128 --> 11:31.239
Good luck, though.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.432
Cheerio!

11:33.433 --> 11:35.467
Well, you heard the lady.
Time for work.

11:35.468 --> 11:36.752
It's go time.

11:38.205 --> 11:40.222
- Ha ha!
- Oh!

11:41.832 --> 11:44.752
No one told me
we were wearing our tuxes.

11:44.753 --> 11:47.213
I'm not even gonna look down.

11:59.391 --> 12:03.144
The ice has arrived.
I repeat, the ice has arrived.

12:04.565 --> 12:06.357
all right, let's blend in,
try not to draw

12:06.358 --> 12:07.942
any attention to ourselves.

12:07.943 --> 12:10.403
Oh, my God. Open bar.
Body shots!

12:11.530 --> 12:13.781
You're late.
Let's get the bra backstage.

12:13.782 --> 12:15.457
Oz, you said it could be me.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.452
You promised!
No <i>take-backsies!</i>

12:17.453 --> 12:20.595
Just try to act like
you've been there, kid.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.624
Whoo! I'm ready!

12:23.625 --> 12:29.213
Children, mommy's
got some late-night snackies...

12:29.214 --> 12:31.022
Just me, I'm afraid.
The others have gone

12:31.023 --> 12:33.759
on a dangerous recon mission
to the casino.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.928
I thought it would be best
to stay here,

12:35.929 --> 12:37.479
away from the proton packs

12:37.480 --> 12:39.932
and the crossing
of the streams, et cetera.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.616
Did you now?

12:41.617 --> 12:42.852
Apparently,
they're making headway.

12:42.853 --> 12:45.069
Cash just called and said
they've got a lead

12:45.070 --> 12:47.273
on someone called
"Gozer the Gozerian."

12:47.274 --> 12:49.240
Sounds like
quite an unsavory fellow,

12:49.241 --> 12:52.026
if you ask me.

12:55.113 --> 12:57.658
Ahh.

12:59.084 --> 13:00.502
Oh.

13:00.503 --> 13:04.165

13:19.688 --> 13:21.055
No problem.

13:21.056 --> 13:23.891
Damn! Double damn!

13:27.446 --> 13:30.031
What's the matter, Cambo?
You seem a little down.

13:30.032 --> 13:31.416
No, I know. It's just...

13:31.417 --> 13:32.867

should be here with us.

13:32.868 --> 13:34.862

bailed like that. Ohh.

in a sea of beauty.

13:37.491 --> 13:39.033

13:40.543 --> 13:42.377

to the reason we are all here.

13:42.378 --> 13:44.512
Yeah, Abe Frohman,

13:44.513 --> 13:45.597
Yeah. Huge fan.

13:45.598 --> 13:47.375
- Your coding is elegant.
- Okay.

13:47.376 --> 13:50.253

There are some chicks around.

13:50.254 --> 13:51.469
Yeah, sorry.
I just... I've never met...

13:51.470 --> 13:53.297
- A billionaire before.
- That he whispers?

13:53.298 --> 13:54.639
Say it louder
so the girls can hear.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.773
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:55.774 --> 13:57.692

14:03.365 --> 14:04.482
We're dead!

14:04.483 --> 14:05.810

What are we gonna do?

14:07.202 --> 14:08.319

14:08.320 --> 14:10.064
Why don't we ask Abe
for a million? No.

I don't think

to come here

and then you bring

I'm his boss.

15:38.127 --> 15:41.079
Wow. Good stuff.

15:42.864 --> 15:45.133

to hiring us

15:45.134 --> 15:47.585
to securing his entire
organization...

15:47.586 --> 15:49.504
And you had to go
and flash your rocks.

15:49.505 --> 15:51.005
What?
Oh.

15:51.006 --> 15:52.223
- Ohh.
- That was the biggest job of the year.

15:52.224 --> 15:54.126
Hmm.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.294
Enjoy your night.

15:55.295 --> 15:57.129
Uh...

16:05.761 --> 16:08.016
Mm! Hi. How was recon?

16:08.017 --> 16:09.368
Anyone want to pull
the bull...

16:09.369 --> 16:10.850
Or bulls?

16:10.851 --> 16:12.537
I've had dozens of them.

16:12.538 --> 16:13.872
I feel like I've been running
with the things.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.438
Ooh!

16:15.439 --> 16:16.742
You were here all night?

16:16.743 --> 16:19.328
Yeah! I've caught
the culprit.

16:25.324 --> 16:29.411
Marco polo.

16:29.412 --> 16:32.247
The waitress was signaling
when the dealer had a bust card.

16:32.248 --> 16:33.832
I found dozens of instances.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.377
Well, you never cease
to impress, do ya?

16:35.378 --> 16:36.711
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

16:36.712 --> 16:38.730
So I guess chasing
Gozer the Gozerian was

16:38.731 --> 16:40.630
a waste of time, eh?

16:40.631 --> 16:43.018
Gozer the Gozerian?

16:43.019 --> 16:44.219
You mean
the all-powerful demigod

16:44.220 --> 16:45.687
from "Ghostbusters"

16:45.688 --> 16:47.856
- that assumed the form of the stay...
- Ahem. Ahem.

16:47.857 --> 16:51.015
Not the time
for fun facts, Ricky.

16:51.016 --> 16:54.162
Uh, you did...

16:54.163 --> 16:58.834
You did go to the casino
last night, correct?

17:02.735 --> 17:04.194
We, uh...

17:04.195 --> 17:07.949
<i>Uh...</i> OK... uh...

17:07.950 --> 17:12.369
We... sorta... went
to the pretty lady party.

17:12.371 --> 17:14.955
It sucked, though.
The parking was a nightmare.

17:14.957 --> 17:17.636
So you... you used me

17:17.637 --> 17:18.917
for breasts.

17:18.919 --> 17:20.422
Uh, not just any breasts.

17:20.423 --> 17:22.297
They were
professional tiggle biddies.

17:22.298 --> 17:25.310
Right. Well...

17:25.310 --> 17:27.646
Score one for the cool kids.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.949
You pretended you liked me

17:30.950 --> 17:34.152
and tricked me into feeling
like part of the team.

17:35.893 --> 17:37.105
Well done.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.747
I'm one
of the cool kids now?

17:48.822 --> 17:50.366
Knock, knock.

17:50.367 --> 17:54.996
Oh, hey. Just chilling out
with my "Kama Sutra."

17:54.997 --> 17:56.975
I don't know about you,
but seeing people

17:56.976 --> 17:59.294
twist themselves into
unlikely sexual positions

17:59.295 --> 18:01.920
just...
Really relaxes me.

18:01.921 --> 18:05.548
So you're not still angry about
the little panty party, are ya?

18:05.549 --> 18:07.602
Not about the party.

18:07.603 --> 18:10.553
I'm upset because I have
to apologize to you

18:10.554 --> 18:16.100
for screwing everything up
with that stupid app king.

18:16.101 --> 18:18.697
Well, I did just get off
the phone with said app king,

18:18.698 --> 18:20.688
and he has hired us.

18:20.689 --> 18:22.584
Apparently,
your little dance routine

18:22.585 --> 18:24.734
has gone viral
and made him a fortune.

18:24.735 --> 18:26.421
Oh, my God.

18:26.422 --> 18:29.708
Please tell me my boobs
look fantastic.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.544
Your boobs look like
a million bucks.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.546
Hmm. Why am I not surprised?

18:34.547 --> 18:37.665
Mm. Look, you know...

18:37.666 --> 18:39.801
You are not the only one around
here who needs to apologize.

18:39.802 --> 18:43.522
I mean...
You are the boss,

18:43.523 --> 18:45.588
and, uh...
I need to get used to that,

18:45.589 --> 18:48.758
so I am sorry.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.316
Oh, my God.
Are we having a <i>mo-mo?</i>

18:54.317 --> 18:56.434
Well, we were
until you said "mo-mo."

19:10.404 --> 19:12.782
Are you okay?

19:12.783 --> 19:14.469
I'm fine. Thank you.

19:14.470 --> 19:16.870
I'm just having
a snack break.

19:16.871 --> 19:18.206
I'm gonna...

19:18.207 --> 19:19.330
Please don't.

19:19.331 --> 19:21.541
I just want to be left alone.

19:22.751 --> 19:24.896
I'm a mess!

19:24.897 --> 19:27.265
Ohh.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.518
Look, look, it's true, okay?

19:29.519 --> 19:31.686
We used you to go
to the party.

19:31.687 --> 19:33.553
It was a...
Stupid thing to do.

19:33.554 --> 19:36.191
It's fine.

19:36.192 --> 19:38.433
I'm used to being treated
like an outcast.

19:38.434 --> 19:41.019
I grew up
the weird homeschooled girl,

19:41.020 --> 19:43.915
and then I was fast-tracked
to university at 14,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.083
but nobody wanted
to be friends

19:45.084 --> 19:47.775
with a pint-size swot.

19:47.776 --> 19:49.736
I thought maybe things
would be better

19:49.737 --> 19:52.173
now that I've graduated,
you know...

19:52.174 --> 19:54.532
But here we are again.

19:54.533 --> 19:57.245
You know, uh...
I didn't fit in at first either.

19:57.246 --> 20:01.706
Please. You are
Mr. Cool Fist-Bump guy.

20:01.707 --> 20:05.086
Now, but it took time.

20:05.087 --> 20:07.806
I mean...
If you feel like a freak,

20:07.807 --> 20:09.714
then this office is perfect
for you.

20:09.715 --> 20:12.277
I do feel like a freak.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.679
Come on.
You know you want to.

20:21.977 --> 20:23.853
That was my first time.

20:23.854 --> 20:26.189
You'd never know.

20:27.439 --> 20:28.774
I'm gonna try
and get outta here.

20:28.775 --> 20:29.776
Oh.

20:29.777 --> 20:31.212
Maybe just w...
