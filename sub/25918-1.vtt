WEBVTT

00:08.633 --> 00:11.219
-I'm Genevieve Gorder
-And I'm Pete Lorimer.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.596
She's the world-famous interior designer.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.223
And he's the real estate guru.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.934
There's been a revolution
in real estate.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.271
Companies like Airbnb and VRBO
are helping homeowners

00:21.354 --> 00:23.064
turn their property into profit.

00:23.189 --> 00:26.234
I would pay $500 a night for this space.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.737
Whoa, this is a statement!

00:28.820 --> 00:31.906
But some properties
are absolutely dreadful.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.743
- It looks like a frat house.
- I walk into my master suite,

00:34.826 --> 00:38.079
you're reminding me of how fat I am
and that I should be working.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.624
So we're traveling the globe
helping vacation rental owners

00:41.708 --> 00:44.335
transform their homes
from one-star disappointments

00:45.336 --> 00:46.588
to a five-star stay.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.465
Oh, my God!

00:48.548 --> 00:50.800
We'll create moneymakers
for homeowners.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.553
We can get you to $1,500 a night.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.972
And a memorable experience
for their guests.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.184
Having a fire feature
can really increase your rate.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.727
God, you guys are good.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.479
We'll do it with great design.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.774
And business knowhow.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.194
You are a general manager
of a small hotel.

01:09.277 --> 01:13.239
Oh, my God! It is fricking amazing!

01:14.699 --> 01:16.493
- Beautiful!
- I'm in a magazine.

01:16.576 --> 01:20.163
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna crush my competition.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.081
Hurray!

01:23.958 --> 01:26.503
On this episode we're off
to the Seattle waterfront

01:26.586 --> 01:28.630
to help the owners of this houseboat.

01:28.713 --> 01:31.091
It looks like Scooby Doo's
Magical Mystery Machine.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.344
- Currently it's a sinking ship.
- I think the word is money pit.

01:35.136 --> 01:39.182
We'll turn this floating
rental into a cozy, romantic getaway.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.893
Oh, my God! That's crazy!

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.700 --> 02:01.621
It really does look like
the Frasier outline, from the TV show.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.248
It's even pretty when gray.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.584
I mean, nature-wise,
this city really owns it.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.461
And water everywhere.

02:08.836 --> 02:12.799
And there's a whole community in Seattle
of people that must live on the water.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.968
- You ready?
- I can't wait.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.973
Seattle has had
a houseboat culture since the late 1800s

02:20.056 --> 02:23.351
when floating camps were built
to house the logging industry.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.063
Today the tradition is still alive
throughout the Puget Sound,

02:27.147 --> 02:30.608
making it one of the top destinations
in the world for waterfront living.

02:32.026 --> 02:35.280
As a whole, Seattle
has over 5,000 vacation rentals

02:35.363 --> 02:39.909
that generated $125 million in revenue
for homeowners last year.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.496
Of those rentals,
there are only 27 houseboats,

02:43.580 --> 02:46.624
which brought in about $740,000.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.545
All right, my dear, more Seattle coffee.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.882
So, I like properties
that are unique, right?

02:53.965 --> 02:56.384
We say unique all the time
in real estate, and it isn't,

02:56.467 --> 02:57.427
but this...

02:58.011 --> 03:01.848
it's just a little houseboat
that you can rent for a vacation,

03:01.931 --> 03:06.269
and for us, it kind of looks zany.

03:06.352 --> 03:11.149
Well, that's what I look for. I look for
the diamonds that need a lot of polishing.

03:11.232 --> 03:14.194
Houseboats are just cool,
so as an experience,

03:14.277 --> 03:17.155
-I feel like it's exceptional.
-I've got some pictures here.

03:18.072 --> 03:21.492
So, this is the Aqua Lounge,
currently listed at $100 a night.

03:21.993 --> 03:25.622
It's a one-bedroom, one-bath houseboat
with city and waterfront views.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.624
I like the boat slip location.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.835
It's pretty tight in there.
It's about 450 square feet

03:30.919 --> 03:33.755
with a rooftop deck
that's an additional 180 square feet.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.257
Which looks like it's not even being used.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.552
Well, the outside's nice, Gen,
but the inside is questionable.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.472
These are the worst marketing photos
we have ever seen.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.932
They need our help.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.560
The bones of the boat
are pretty, but the space is so crammed

03:47.644 --> 03:51.272
that I think we can open it up
and rebuild the entire kitchen.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.983
So, if you can rebuild it,
I can rebrand it.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.237
And with some killer marketing, I think
we can weave the story together.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.780
I agree. I think it's really cool.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.032
How are you gonna do renovations
on a boat

04:01.366 --> 04:03.534
in the rain on the water?

04:03.618 --> 04:05.036
I mean, you can't.

04:05.119 --> 04:08.623
So, we've pulled the boat
out of the water, put it in a boat yard.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.584
-Let's go meet them. I can't wait to.
-You ready? I know.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.933
-Well...
-Okay.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.478
It's like a little piece of the Caribbean
in the Northwest.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.314
It looks like Scooby Doo's
Magical Mystery Machine.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.400
Ah, look, here come Jeff and Jessica.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.444
Hi, guys. Let's warm up and hug.

04:38.778 --> 04:39.779
-How you doing?
-Hi.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.990
-Nice to meet you finally.
-Nice to meet you, Jeff.

04:42.073 --> 04:45.201
-My name is Jeff Cline.
-And my name is Jessica Summerville.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.788
-We've been married for three years.
-And we have a...

04:48.913 --> 04:52.750
rental property here at China Harbor
Marina in Seattle, Washington.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.503
The houseboat is located on Lake Union.

04:55.586 --> 04:59.132
Lake Union
is kind of in the heart of Seattle.

04:59.215 --> 05:02.176
-You got this boat how long ago?
-2012?

05:02.260 --> 05:05.054
-We bought it off of Craigslist, actually.
-Why'd you buy it?

05:05.138 --> 05:08.266
We'd just started dating,
so we weren't ready to move in yet.

05:08.349 --> 05:11.519
We bought a houseboat because
we were looking for a place

05:11.602 --> 05:17.775
to stay and live in Seattle that would be
unique, fun, and also cost-effective.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.819
It's also when we started
shacking up, too.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.739
Oh, right, of course.
That's when we first moved in together.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.408
-What did you pay for it?
-145.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.659
-That's pretty good.
-Yeah.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.079
We thought. We thought it was a good deal,
but there were lots of problems.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.622
When we purchased the boat,

05:31.706 --> 05:34.792
an inspector said,
You're gonna have to repair this hull,"

05:34.876 --> 05:38.046
so we owe the bank
a lot of money for the repairs…

05:38.129 --> 05:39.380
-Right.
-...that we just did.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.384
Now, I know that you had it on the market,
and how many renters did you get?

05:44.135 --> 05:44.969
One.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.180
That's better than zero.

05:47.263 --> 05:52.101
Having this be successful for us
is critical for our finances

05:52.185 --> 05:55.355
because we have one daughter
that's going to college soon

05:55.438 --> 06:00.068
and one daughter whose childcare costs
as much as college costs in Seattle.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.737
I run a nonprofit. She's a professor.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.907
We're not real estate tycoons.
We need help.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.241
Yeah, for sure.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.829
So this is the tiny door that you go into
to enter the property?

06:11.913 --> 06:14.999
-Yeah, that's right. I know, isn't it?
-It's tiny. Yeah!

06:15.083 --> 06:16.376
It's like a closet door.

06:16.459 --> 06:20.546
First thing I'm seeing are gas tanks
and a water heater and a dinky door.

06:20.713 --> 06:24.258
We need to really have that curb appeal
begin to set the stage.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.343
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.558
It's a little bit claustrophobic.
It's very tight. It's like--

06:32.725 --> 06:34.727
-Claustrophobic?
-Come up through propane,

06:34.811 --> 06:37.230
and now I'm in this little corridor,

06:37.355 --> 06:40.483
and my first two experiences
are kind of bumming me out, you know?

06:40.566 --> 06:41.609
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yep.

06:41.692 --> 06:45.696
Nothing says romance to me like
having a gigantic laundry in your room.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.074
Why is this here?

06:48.157 --> 06:51.202
Well, you need one,
and there was no place for it to go.

06:51.285 --> 06:54.872
We're not just dealing with square feet
here. We're dealing with cubic feet, too.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.875
That's a family's laundry machine.
You don't need that.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.296
I see that you have
a gigantic fridge here.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.134
Right? All joking aside, I mean,
real estate's at a premium.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.176
Yeah, yep.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.929
Do your guests need
a fridge that big? I don't think so.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.390
Let's talk about
the appliance situation,

07:12.473 --> 07:16.686
because we said, '84 the boat
was created, right? And...

07:16.769 --> 07:19.272
are the appliances original
to that time as well?

07:19.522 --> 07:21.357
- Yeah.
- Those are non-negotiable.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.943
We have to update in order
to move ahead with renting.

07:24.026 --> 07:27.864
If it's just us, we can live with what
we got, but when we're renting

07:27.989 --> 07:30.867
to hundreds of other people, we have
to satiate and  gtake care of people.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.411
And upstairs, should we go up there?

07:33.494 --> 07:34.829
-Yeah. Let's do it.
-Let's go.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.796
Okay. Oh, I like this little...

07:44.589 --> 07:45.465
sweet nook.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.136
-Okay,
-I like this.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.763
Yeah! This is a thought.

07:52.847 --> 07:58.019
Master could go downstairs,
if I reorganize the space plan.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.396
If we move it down, it doesn't mean
you lose a bedroom here.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.982
-Right.
-This can still function as one. In fact,

08:03.065 --> 08:06.235
you gain another bedroom 'cause
whatever you got downstairs right now,

08:06.319 --> 08:07.695
that ain't a bedroom.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.198
-Let's go out.
-Yeah.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.867
This is huge!

08:13.201 --> 08:15.620
-This is like a real yard.
-Yeah!

08:16.537 --> 08:19.582
Twelve feet wide,
which is a nice-sized deck,

08:20.124 --> 08:22.210
and then we have probably...

08:23.544 --> 08:26.255
-fifteen? Maybe a little more?
-I think at least. Yeah.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.759
You have two rooms within this one space.

08:30.134 --> 08:33.471
Right now you're only using
a tiny portion of it. So, what is does

08:33.763 --> 08:36.515
is it gives the illusion
of it being smaller than it actually is.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.143
-Yep.
-What would I be looking at

08:39.309 --> 08:43.356
-if I were where you normally are parked?
-You're looking out seeing water,

08:44.106 --> 08:48.069
and then towards the right
you can see the top of the--

08:48.152 --> 08:50.363
-The Space Needle?
-The Space Needle, yup.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.199
-I see dollar signs.
-Yes, me, too.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.410
Speaking of which, perhaps we should
go talk about business.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.668
So, the good news is that
all the bits and bobs are here, right?

09:04.293 --> 09:07.672
For me, as a business guy,
I see a massive opportunity

09:07.755 --> 09:11.050
-to blow this place out of the water.
-Awesome.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.635
-Excited?
-Oh, yeah.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.430
I've-- We've worked with a lot of couples,
but I feel like you guys are so

09:16.514 --> 09:19.058
much more ready
to give your property away,

09:19.141 --> 09:22.979
probably because it's been
a little bit of a burden for a long time.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.564
I think the word is money pit.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.652
So, in summary, what is your goal monthly?

09:29.735 --> 09:32.780
We want to cover all the expenses
associated with this boat.

09:32.863 --> 09:36.534
So, that is mortgage, moorage, pump out,

09:36.617 --> 09:39.620
and then we also want to cover
little Rosie's childcare.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.248
So, all together,
that's about $4,000 a month.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.625
The numbers
are really, really encouraging.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.545
There's a renovated houseboat in
the marina right next door to your boat.

09:47.628 --> 09:51.424
That boat is generating
$70,000 a year income.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.634
-Wow, amazing.
-Did you know that?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.720
-No.
-Seventy grand.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.264
-Right, And they're consistently booked.
-Wow.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.975
I think the pictures
are decidedly average.

10:01.058 --> 10:05.104
You're trying to make $48,000 a year,
and your neighbor's making 70,000,

10:05.187 --> 10:08.816
but we're gonna crush your neighbor
with design goodies.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.360
Last time you rented it,
how much did you rent it for?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.029
A hundred dollars a night.

10:13.112 --> 10:16.115
For me, the art of pricing,
is to make yourself competitive.

10:16.198 --> 10:20.077
And I think by the time that Gen and I
are done, we can get you to 250 a night

10:20.161 --> 10:23.873
and about 16 nights a month,
which will get you to your $4,000 a month

10:24.206 --> 10:26.876
and a total of $48,000 a year.

10:26.959 --> 10:31.005
Let's talk a litte bit about
what you guys envision for this place.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.215
What do you want it
to feel like stylistically?

10:33.299 --> 10:38.346
I have in my mind, like, a Swedish
summer cottage type of situation.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.722
What about you, Jeff?

10:40.306 --> 10:44.226
I have in my mind, like, a Swedish
summer cottage... type of thing.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.146
-The secret to a happy marriage.
-Bravo! Bravo!

10:47.730 --> 10:50.066
Okay, let's walk this out.
Pete, can I get out real quick?

10:50.149 --> 10:53.069
This boat is going to be about
tiny house living

10:53.152 --> 10:55.571
and maximizing all of our space.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.158
So, let's start with this living room.
In between these two windows.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.286
is your king-size bed, bedside tables,

11:02.370 --> 11:06.374
laundry, all goes back here,
and we'll take out the hallway wall.

11:06.707 --> 11:10.920
Couch now comes here, so living room
is happening right in here.

11:11.003 --> 11:14.090
The kitchen gets blasted out.
The core of your house is gone,

11:14.173 --> 11:17.093
except we're leaving this nook.
It feels very boat-y.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.428
-Yep.
-Upstairs it's lounge and read a book,

11:19.595 --> 11:21.806
-your library, and a dining area.
-Okay.

11:21.889 --> 11:25.893
So, we need to rebuild and rebrand
as a romantic Seattle getaway.

11:25.976 --> 11:29.897
That's our goal, and I think I feel
very confident saying that we can hit it.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.871
For the houseboat to succeed,

11:45.955 --> 11:49.542
we want to rebuild and rebrand it
as a romantic Seattle getaway.

11:49.834 --> 11:53.337
To do that, Genevieve is going
to completely gut the downstairs

11:53.421 --> 11:56.215
and rebuild it as a comfortable,
cozy tiny home.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.969
Then we'll go over how to create
a welcoming arrival experience

12:00.052 --> 12:01.595
with local delicacies.

12:01.679 --> 12:05.141
Finally, we'll go over
exactly how to pay for Internet ads

12:05.266 --> 12:07.476
to get people booking the vacation rental.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.115
It's day two on our 1984 houseboat,

12:21.198 --> 12:23.451
and we are demolition heavy.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.164
We're taking out the kitchen,
all the closets,

12:28.247 --> 12:30.374
and we're gonna give it
a new coat of lovely.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.086
All construction needs to stop.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.380
Baby coming onto site.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.257
-Come on, guys. Come on in.
-All right.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.759
-Hey.
-You got your babe?

12:40.968 --> 12:42.636
Little pickle!

12:44.013 --> 12:45.556
This is Rosie!

12:45.639 --> 12:47.558
Oh, my gosh, she's beautiful, you guys.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.934
-Thank you.
-She's adorable.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.895
What'd you do to our houseboat?

12:50.978 --> 12:52.313
Oh, my God, it's crazy.

12:52.396 --> 12:55.608
I guarantee, once you see
the finished product, it'll be worth it.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.944
This is not your job anymore
for the rest of the week, okay?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.988
Go. We got you. We're working for you.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.948
-Bye. Have fun.
-No peeking.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.014
The biggest problem
with Jeff and Jessica's houseboat rental

13:27.097 --> 13:29.517
are the oversized, old,
and broken appliances

13:29.600 --> 13:32.311
that take up way too much valuable space
in the kitchen.

13:32.436 --> 13:36.816
Our new design will maximize the area by
using smaller, more space-efficient units,

13:37.149 --> 13:39.860
and the best place to get
hese tiny living fixtures

13:39.944 --> 13:41.612
is at the local marine supply store.

13:42.154 --> 13:46.408
It's all the small living things you need
and to take you from '84

13:46.492 --> 13:47.618
-to present day.
-Yep.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.579
-It's kind of original tiny house living.
-Oh, yeah.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.209
So, let's look at some space savers
for the boathouse.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.919
-Okay.
-Anything in the kitchen

13:57.211 --> 13:59.713
should be functional and beautiful,

13:59.797 --> 14:01.924
so it becomes its own accessory

14:02.007 --> 14:04.760
instead of decor in the kitchen,
stuff we actually use.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.429
So you can stack all the pots.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.723
-Then attach the handle.
-So much easier without handles.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.101
And then you attach, and apparently

14:12.184 --> 14:15.771
Europe is using these for regular living
'cause their places are so small.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.940
How are you guys doing dishes now?

14:18.023 --> 14:20.359
-By hand.
-Right, not sexy.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.070
-No.
-The dishwashers are pretty...

14:23.696 --> 14:26.448
-teeny-tiny, but look at this.
-Oh, my gosh.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.993
I don't imagine
people would be cooking a lot,

14:29.535 --> 14:32.454
but to be able to wash what they do cook,

14:32.538 --> 14:34.665
I think, is key, and it also helps
you guys out.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.500
-Yeah, for cleaning afterwards.
-Right?

14:37.001 --> 14:42.006
The stove situation on tiny living,
boat living is so cute. I can't--

14:42.089 --> 14:44.550
-Oh, my God.
-It looks like a kid's stove. It's--

14:44.633 --> 14:46.427
I know. They're awesome.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.888
-It's like an Easy-Bake Oven.
-Easy-Bake Oven. Totally.

14:49.013 --> 14:52.892
We are not cooking Thanksgiving
on the boat. Let's keep shopping.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.521
When you're thinking about non-locals
who are coming to stay here,

14:57.897 --> 15:00.107
we don't understand weather,

15:00.190 --> 15:03.944
no matter how many times
you say, "It rains."

15:04.111 --> 15:08.365
Currently, what do you have onboard
for your guests when it comes to rain?

15:08.908 --> 15:09.825
An umbrella.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.121
-Didn't you say that locals don't use...
-Locals don't use umbrellas.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.458
But we leave one for the guests,
just in case.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.502
I think what would be great is,
you know, not to go crazy,

15:20.711 --> 15:23.672
-but just leave a couple of rain jackets.
-Yep.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.926
Like, average size or a little big
so it fits everybody.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.595
People will appreciate the effort.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.473
-I think we have a good amount of stuff.
-Yeah.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.016
-Ready to check out?
-Let's do it.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.559
I could stay here all day. I love it.

15:46.946 --> 15:51.158
We are taking this houseboat
from 1984 golden wood

15:51.241 --> 15:53.827
to present-day Scandinavian wonderland.

15:53.911 --> 15:57.873
This is amazing. I love it!

15:58.040 --> 16:00.834
I found you 'cause I wanted to make
a special door.

16:00.918 --> 16:04.838
And I definitely wanted to include
some of the native patterns of Washington,

16:04.922 --> 16:07.341
the totem poles being so prolific here.

16:07.424 --> 16:11.470
As you may know, a pillar of the Northwest
lifestyle is the great outdoors.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.847
-Yes.
-So, I love this work

16:13.931 --> 16:17.142
because it brings the outdoors in,
but in a really modern, contemporary,

16:17.226 --> 16:18.686
sort of abstract way.

16:18.769 --> 16:22.731
We've demolished the innards,
really made this feel double the size.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.235
The exterior has gone black,
and the interior has gone white

16:26.318 --> 16:29.154
to give it that modern,
Scandinavian design aesthetic.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.616
-Wow, Gen!
-Yeah!

16:32.700 --> 16:36.537
-Number one, it feels twice the size.
-This wall's come down.

16:36.620 --> 16:40.040
This was higher booth, and we had
that weird column right here

16:40.124 --> 16:41.667
-that we didn't need.
-That's right.

16:41.750 --> 16:46.422
I love that if I'm here now,
I get a whole sense of the room.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.133
The white makes the ceiling lift.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.844
It gives the illusion
that we're in a taller space.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.929
This is terrific. I love this gray.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.723
The quartz is super utilitarian,

16:55.806 --> 16:59.727
great for multiple visits
from multiple people,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.271
easy to clean, heat-resistant.

17:02.354 --> 17:06.775
So, we have a ton to do, since the boat is
returning back to its slip in the morning.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.778
Let's go so they can spray
this whole thing another time.

17:27.503 --> 17:30.424
For Peter!

17:34.261 --> 17:36.930
We are in Pike Place Market
in Seattle.

17:40.809 --> 17:43.520
It's one of the most famous
farmer's markets in the world,

17:43.604 --> 17:45.606
full of local treats and goodies.

17:45.689 --> 17:49.026
Do you think this would be good,
the local Washington apple experience?

17:49.109 --> 17:50.903
-Would that be-- That's good.
-For sure, yeah.

17:50.986 --> 17:55.240
We've sent the homeowners in the market
to curate some of their favorite foods

17:55.324 --> 17:59.620
that they think would be ideal to offer
guests when they arrive at the houseboat.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.081
It's a welcome basket of local delicacies.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.041
-Hello, hello.
-Hi!

18:05.167 --> 18:06.460
-Piroshky!
-I know.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.461
Piroshky.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.255
-Looks pretty amazing, right?
-I've heard of this place.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.509
-This...
-I know, right?

18:14.009 --> 18:15.719
-All this food.
-What else have you bought?

18:15.803 --> 18:17.888
We got a big chunk of smoked salmon.

18:17.971 --> 18:22.101
We got the Beecher's Flagship Cheddar
and some cheese curds.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.853
-We got apple chips.
-These are local. They're from...

18:24.937 --> 18:27.231
Washington state,
so we thought that would be good.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.817
These, I think, are incredible
and really special.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.487
The rule of thumb is this, for the little
accoutrements when they arrive.

18:33.695 --> 18:38.742
Whatever you're charging for the night,
take 10% of that and spend it on goodies.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.787
-Got it.
-So, in the summer, if it's 300 a night,

18:42.121 --> 18:44.748
spend 30 bucks. Only on the first night.

18:44.832 --> 18:49.545
And it will just mean so much to them that
they walk into that Seattle experience.

19:14.736 --> 19:18.365
The houseboat has made its way
from the boatyard into their boat slip.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.576
Now we can start loading in the furniture.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.830
So, we're putting together a walnut bed,
kind of a low-riding bed,

19:24.913 --> 19:28.709
brass nightstands,
really beautiful Danish lamps.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.836
It doesn't look like 1984 anymore.

19:41.763 --> 19:45.475
We want to make sure our houseboat
has incredible adventures to offer guests,

19:45.559 --> 19:48.770
so we've made sure to add some experiences
to the house guidebook

19:48.854 --> 19:50.189
like coffee tasting...

19:50.689 --> 19:52.107
hot tub boat rentals,

19:52.316 --> 19:55.110
and even professional
vacation photographers.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.155
Perfect, give her a kiss
on the cheek. Smile like you love it.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.656
Cute! Perfect!

19:59.740 --> 20:03.368
Now we've got Jeff and Jessica
a new profile picture for their website,

20:03.619 --> 20:06.455
it's time to introduce them
to a romantic dinner experience

20:06.538 --> 20:08.373
they must guide their guests to.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.418
Give it a good sort of push.
You don't need to twist or burrow.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.128
Oyster shucking class.

20:13.712 --> 20:17.341
This is a great perk 'cause it's one of
the number one restaurants in Seattle,

20:17.424 --> 20:20.552
and it's, what, a ten-minute paddle
to your houseboat?

20:20.636 --> 20:23.222
-I'd like to drill down a little bit.
-Okay.

20:23.305 --> 20:27.100
When you put the boat online before,
what kind of advertising did you do?

20:27.184 --> 20:29.686
-We didn't really.
-Yeah, just Craigslist.

20:30.187 --> 20:34.066
-That's all.
-So in your case I would recommend SEO,

20:34.816 --> 20:37.694
-search engine optimization.
-Oh, okay.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.863
Pay-per-click.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.658
Pay-per-click is literally
that you have a phrase,

20:42.824 --> 20:46.328
"Romantic Seattle houseboat rental."

20:46.411 --> 20:48.497
-Yep.
-You go onto Google

20:48.747 --> 20:50.540
and you say, "I'm willing to pay

20:50.624 --> 20:53.835
25¢ every time somebody types that
in the search engine."

20:53.919 --> 20:55.420
-Got it.
-They get sent to you.

20:55.545 --> 20:59.007
Now, there's no guarantee that that click
will transfer into a rental,

20:59.424 --> 21:01.260
but it means you're capturing eyes.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.137
A hundred bucks times 25¢

21:04.513 --> 21:07.140
is 400 sets of eyes.

21:07.224 --> 21:11.436
I'm pretty sure that at least
you will capture 10% of those.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.481
The parameters of your place
are so narrow,

21:14.648 --> 21:16.817
the competition is, what, 30 other places?

21:16.900 --> 21:20.445
If you outspend your competition,
you get their eyes first.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.782
Then after Gen's design,
they'll stop clicking,

21:24.283 --> 21:26.201
and they'll just end with you.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.913
And that is the secret
of pay-per-click marketing.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.081
And own a niche.

21:31.665 --> 21:36.253
You have such a small one that you could
be the king and queen of it like this.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.755
This is what will separate you
from the pack,

21:38.839 --> 21:40.424
-and it can work--
-Niching out.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.677
-Niching out, yo!
-Niching, yeah.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.183
I have a little job
for you, my friend.

21:50.267 --> 21:54.938
I just need you to thread the needle here.
This is the last of our new safety rail.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.524
-Okie-dokie.
-So, no one dies while they're staying

21:57.899 --> 22:00.110
on the romantic houseboat
'cause you know what?

22:00.193 --> 22:01.445
That's not romantic.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.488
But you know what is?

22:03.947 --> 22:05.532
-Yeah?
-There's no rain tonight.

22:06.199 --> 22:11.455
And look what you can see all around us,
like, an incredibly magnificent city.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.082
-So there is a city under the rain.
-Yeah.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.462
This is super romantic.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.880
How lovely.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.382
We got to get going
'cause there's a lot to do,

22:22.466 --> 22:25.344
-but I think they're gonna love this.
-I do, too.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.189
All right, here we go.
Big move, there we go.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.940
-I love it.
-Right there.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.192
Oh, nice leg.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.487
We are almost finished
with our floating love nest.

22:43.570 --> 22:44.738
Okay, lots going on.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.448
Okay, set her down.

22:46.531 --> 22:49.034
When you're dealing with a guest rental,
take the label off

22:49.117 --> 22:50.994
so it doesn't feel too commercial.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.581
It also doesn't command any attention away
from the design,

22:54.664 --> 22:56.541
-but it's still thoughtful.
-Yeah, agree.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.544
If something is too perfect,
people don't feel like they can touch it.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.546
So, if you're gonna put cheese out,

23:01.630 --> 23:04.216
always leave a few crumbles in front.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.967
I mean, that's pretty hot.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.427
I think it looks fantastic.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.847
It's just at the end of this jetty,
down here, where the...

23:10.931 --> 23:14.184
Now that Genevieve has completely
gutted and rebuilt this houseboat,

23:14.684 --> 23:18.188
we need to deliver on the marketing side
by taking professional photos

23:18.271 --> 23:20.524
to sell this lakeside love nest.

23:20.607 --> 23:23.068
The whole thing with this one is romance.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.070
This is a couple's retreat.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.574
This whole thing.
Vignettes everywhere.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.160
Vignettes everywhere.
We want to give the experience

23:32.244 --> 23:35.080
of the 10, 12 different places
to kind of hang out.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.748
-All right.
-That is delicious.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.166
-This is terrific.
-Yeah.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.672
And then, of course, the kind
of communal money shot is this.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.841
Yeah, for sure. It's so beautiful.

23:46.508 --> 23:50.512
Now it's time to get the homeowners
and show them their new floating hotel.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.894
You bought this houseboat back from 1984.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.688
-Yes.
-When you were

23:59.855 --> 24:01.857
newly dating and romantic,

24:01.940 --> 24:04.985
and as your family grew,
you moved back onto terra firma

24:05.110 --> 24:08.738
and decided to turn your houseboat
 into an income-generating property.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.490
-We did.
-We did.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.784
-Are you ready?
-We're ready. We can't wait!

24:13.535 --> 24:15.912
-Three, two, one...
-Three, two, one...

24:16.705 --> 24:17.581
look.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.167
Oh, my God, that's crazy!

24:20.250 --> 24:22.419
-That is awesome.
-It looks amazing!

24:22.502 --> 24:24.963
I can't believe it.
It doesn't even look like our boat.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.756
-I know.
-It looks like someone else's boat.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.843
-It looks awesome.
-Let's think about it how it was.

24:29.926 --> 24:33.096
Do you remember the kind of
turquoise and green and--

24:33.180 --> 24:36.349
And now you've become,
like, this elegant house.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.936
Sophisticated, dark, and stormy,
I love it. It looks amazing.

24:40.020 --> 24:44.441
All those textures are now
united in one elegant black coat.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.401
It really has a commanding presence now,

24:46.485 --> 24:48.945
and it really feels much more unified
than it did before.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.198
-You ready to go see it? Okay.
-Yes, please.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.742
It really kind of pulls you in.
It's totally unique.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.827
It's like nothing else in the marina.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.705
-And the door. It's incredible.
-Yeah, the door, oh, my God.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.707
The door is a jewel.

25:00.790 --> 25:05.003
Handmade, local woods,
a real Native American aesthetic.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.881
So, one of the fundamental things
of owning a short-term rental

25:07.964 --> 25:09.382
is how do people get in?

25:09.466 --> 25:11.635
Are you gonna greet them?
Are you not gonna greet them?

25:11.718 --> 25:13.136
Also, you're on a boat.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.680
So, if somebody loses their keys
in the drink,

25:16.181 --> 25:17.557
it's a nightmare.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.684
So, now we have an electronic key.

25:20.143 --> 25:23.396
-So, you punch in the code, and it opens.
-Wow.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.565
-Are you ready to go inside?
-Yes!

25:26.024 --> 25:29.402
Oh, my God! No way!

25:30.820 --> 25:33.240
This looks amazing!

25:33.823 --> 25:35.367
Check this out.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.454
-It's, like, so much more wide open.
-I know.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.998
-It's awesome.
-Oh, my God.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.918
It's light and open.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.422
I didn't expect it to be, like,
so bright and beautiful.

25:49.506 --> 25:54.511
I loved it. I mean, it feels so warm
and comfortable and clean.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.722
It even looks like somehow
the ceiling is higher.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.476
-I'm getting emotional. This is amazing.
-I know.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.230
-Look at our kitchen, at our countertops.
-It looks so good.

26:05.313 --> 26:08.775
Look how big that sink is.
How are we gonna not live here?

26:08.858 --> 26:11.778
The cooktop was
a crusty critter when we got here.

26:11.861 --> 26:14.906
Now you have a brand-new cooktop
from 2018.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.576
-There's your fridge.
-Awesome.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.535
A baby fridge.

26:18.618 --> 26:19.744
Check it out. Open it.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.622
I think that's just enough room
for a long weekend.

26:22.706 --> 26:26.501
We have a good-sized fridge, but it's
not oversized like we had before.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.086
You gained a microwave.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.130
- We have a dishwasher.
- I know.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.091
-The kitchen blows me away.
-The kitchen was--

26:33.174 --> 26:34.843
It's much more compact in space,

26:34.926 --> 26:39.055
but we have so much more storage in there
because everything is flush with the wall.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.766
That is so awesome, and look at this.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.144
Your washer looks almost brand-new.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.771
All we've done
is take the drawer off the bottom

26:46.855 --> 26:49.816
-to make it a little bit shorter.
-Yeah, that's great.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.694
-Those are our recommendations.
-That's awesome.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.238
-We designed a little poster...
-No way.

26:55.322 --> 26:59.576
-with all of your recommendations.
-That's so cool. I love that. Great.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.621
Check out this table.

27:03.038 --> 27:07.667
- That's awesome.
- Oh, my God. I'm in such shock.

27:08.209 --> 27:12.964
Let's check out the bedroom.
This was your living room before.

27:13.048 --> 27:17.052
You had a big sideboard table,
a big, clunky, white couch,

27:17.135 --> 27:20.597
and now you have
an enormous king-size bed.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.515
I want that bed in our house

27:22.599 --> 27:24.476
-where we live.
-Yeah, the bed's gorgeous.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.437
Now, you lost
some common area space, right?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.272
-You were worried?
-But you don't feel it.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.815
-This is cool.
-Right here, right?

27:31.149 --> 27:35.612
We also have custom SelectBlinds
on every single window

27:36.112 --> 27:38.406
that black out every piece of light.

27:41.201 --> 27:46.122
The experience of staying in this bed,
it feels like a fancy hotel suite.

27:46.206 --> 27:48.375
-Yep
-But yet it's floating on water.

27:48.458 --> 27:53.421
The bed is the boss of any hotel stay.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.883
As soon as you come in here,
it's like, get in bed.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.470
That's what a romantic hideout does.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.598
Now, because it's a guest rental,
it makes much more sense

28:03.682 --> 28:05.642
to have the master suite down here.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.894
-That looks so comfy.
-Madame.

28:08.436 --> 28:12.023
-Oh, my gosh, this is awesome.
-That's so cute.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.193
-Look at your view.
-Oh, it's amazing.

28:15.318 --> 28:17.654
I'm jealous that I don't get to stay
on this thing...

28:17.737 --> 28:20.448
-I'm jealous of our guests.
-...all the time. Yes.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.951
I'm totally jealous of our guests
'cause that place is sweet.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.078
-Ready to see upstairs?
-Yeah.

28:25.161 --> 28:27.038
No, actually, I'm not.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.375
Oh, my God!

28:31.334 --> 28:33.420
This looks fantastic.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.881
You can, like,
sit up here, read a book.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.091
Look at this.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.219
This is such a cute little nook up here.

28:47.016 --> 28:50.895
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

28:54.065 --> 28:55.483
It's beautiful.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.611
The only thing
that used to be here on this deck

28:58.695 --> 29:02.282
was this table and these chairs
in totally different colors.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.952
Now you have a quaint dining experience

29:06.035 --> 29:09.205
as well as a full-size bed
of outdoor luxe...

29:09.289 --> 29:11.875
-Yep.
-...and seating for many people.

29:17.922 --> 29:22.093
Summertime is your moneymaking time,
and this was forgotten space up here.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.680
And now you're fully utilizing
your most profitable time of the year.

29:26.598 --> 29:30.769
You've now increased the whole
recreational area of the property.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.645
You've added several hundred feet.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.899
Indoor/outdoor means ka-ching.
I mean, you're killing it.

29:36.566 --> 29:40.487
Definitely think we have
the best houseboat by a long shot.

29:40.570 --> 29:44.365
Completely blew our minds.
We couldn't imagine it looking any better.

29:44.449 --> 29:48.661
So, our goal was to get you
your slip fees, your boat fees,

29:48.745 --> 29:51.456
-and then, of course, tuition for Rosie.
-Yep.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.833
-So, let's average it at $250 a night.
-Okay.

29:53.917 --> 29:58.004
That means you need to have
16 nights per month occupied.

29:58.087 --> 30:01.549
Then you're gonna easily hit
that $4,000 goal, and...

30:02.175 --> 30:04.469
I firmly believe
it can actually surpass that

30:04.636 --> 30:06.679
and get you nicely into the black

30:06.763 --> 30:09.474
so you'll have spare cash
for other things.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.101
I feel like we got
 all of the tools and the tips

30:12.185 --> 30:14.813
and the information
and the support we need to succeed.

30:14.896 --> 30:17.273
But you only get out what you put in.

30:17.524 --> 30:20.360
-When we leave, this is your business.
-Yep.

30:20.485 --> 30:23.112
So, here's the good news.
There's no renters tonight.

30:23.196 --> 30:27.367
So, why don't you try it out,
this entire new houseboat?

30:27.450 --> 30:29.202
-You know what that means?
-Let's go.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.411
We finally get some sleep.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.289
-On that note.
-Said every parent.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.874
-Bring it in.
-Thank you.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.960
Thank you so much.

30:37.210 --> 30:40.421
Now we need to go live
and launch the new property listing.

30:41.047 --> 30:45.051
Nestled on famed Lake Union is
the romantic Seattle Lakeside Love Nest.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.886
The jewel in the crown of this houseboat

30:46.970 --> 30:49.848
is the luxurious master suite
with views across the harbor.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.809
In addition, a new state-of-the-art,
European galley kitchen

30:52.892 --> 30:56.729
offers the ability for cooking
fresh delicacies from Pike Place Market.

30:57.063 --> 30:59.941
Last but not least,
escape into an upper library

31:00.024 --> 31:04.863
or hang al fresco on the deck and enjoy
your perfect view of the Seattle skyline.
