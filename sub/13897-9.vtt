WEBVTT

00:02.960 --> 00:04.080
[LESLIE] ARE YOU GOING
TO EXPLAIN TO ME

00:04.130 --> 00:05.380
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?

00:06.460 --> 00:08.800
ALL THE TIMES
I TELL YOU TO SHUT UP,

00:08.840 --> 00:10.300
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
CHOOSE NOW TO STAY SILENT?

00:13.220 --> 00:15.930
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
BE THAT WAY.

00:15.970 --> 00:18.180
I HAVE NO PROBLEM TALKING

00:18.220 --> 00:20.810
TO A BEAUTIFUL OFFICER
LIKE YOURSELF.

00:21.350 --> 00:22.560
PLEASE.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.150
-SHUT UP.
-GO ON THEN.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.770
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO CAUSED THIS TERRIBLE,
BLOODY MESS OUT THERE?

00:27.820 --> 00:29.070
THAT THING THERE, LUH.

00:29.110 --> 00:30.610
HE'S GOT NO GUTS,

00:30.650 --> 00:34.320
AND HE'S AN IDIOT WHERE
PRESSURE IS CONCERNED,
UNLIKE MYSELF.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.700
[MAURICE] I HAD THE SITUATION
WELL UNDER CONTROL.

00:38.740 --> 00:40.290
-&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;
-HOW MANY BULLETS WAS THAT?

00:40.330 --> 00:42.120
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST MAKE IT STOP!

00:42.160 --> 00:43.410
WELL, IF I'M GONNA
GET THE JUMP...

00:43.460 --> 00:44.920
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

00:44.960 --> 00:46.130
WE GOTTA COUNT
THE AMOUNT OF AMMO

00:46.170 --> 00:47.460
THEY'VE BEEN SHELLING AT US.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.000
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

00:49.050 --> 00:50.550
[MAURICE] OH, WHAT'S THIS?

00:50.590 --> 00:52.420
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, JAKEY.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.470
WE'LL GET YOU AWAY FROM THIS.

00:54.510 --> 00:56.050
OH, COME ON... COME ON!

00:56.090 --> 00:58.140
THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

00:58.180 --> 01:00.770
COWERING?
CRYING? UGH.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.100
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WILL TALK. OKAY?

01:03.140 --> 01:06.480
ANYTHING TO STOP
THE CONSTANT FLOW OF...

01:06.520 --> 01:08.860
CRAP THAT'S COMING
FROM HIS MOUTH.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.480
FIRST OF ALL,
THERE WAS NO MACHINE GUN.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.320
&lt;REWINDING NOISE&gt;

01:13.360 --> 01:15.110
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

01:15.150 --> 01:16.910
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

01:16.950 --> 01:18.410
IT'S LIFE, JAKE!

01:18.450 --> 01:20.330
LOVELY! TELL YOUR MOTHER!

01:20.370 --> 01:22.000
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

01:22.040 --> 01:23.200
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

01:23.250 --> 01:25.750
IF I WANTED YOU KILLED,
YOU'D BE DEAD BY NOW.

01:25.790 --> 01:26.920
GIVE ME THAT.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.170
[MAURICE] OH,
DON'T HURT YOURSELF.

01:28.210 --> 01:29.790
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

01:30.670 --> 01:32.300
GOD, I HATE GUNS.

01:32.340 --> 01:34.380
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME
MUCH TO WORK WITH.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.300
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

01:36.340 --> 01:37.470
HERE WE GO.

01:38.220 --> 01:39.140
ONE...

01:39.800 --> 01:40.970
TWO...

01:41.010 --> 01:42.600
-&lt;GUN COCKING&gt;
-THREE.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.110
♪ OH, YEAH
OH, YEAH ♪

01:52.320 --> 01:54.110
♪ OH, YEAH

01:55.360 --> 01:58.200

01:58.240 --> 02:01.200

02:01.240 --> 02:02.120

02:03.580 --> 02:04.700
&lt;POLICE SIREN&gt;

02:04.750 --> 02:05.910
[JAKE] SO THEN I SAVED US.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.580
THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER,
YOU SHOWED UP.

02:07.620 --> 02:08.880
[MAURICE] SAVED US?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.250
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL THAT?

02:10.290 --> 02:11.840
WHAT ARE YOU ON? CRACK?

02:11.880 --> 02:13.170
LOOK, ENOUGH, OKAY?

02:13.210 --> 02:14.510
SOMEONE...

02:14.550 --> 02:17.010
ONE OF YOU, IS GONNA
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

02:17.050 --> 02:18.800
THE TRUTH, FROM THE START.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.430
OKAY, I WAS MINDING
MY OWN BUSINESS,

02:20.470 --> 02:22.220
AND MY DAY WAS ALREADY OFF...

02:22.260 --> 02:23.850
TO A BAD START.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.930
[JAKE] I WAS AT THE DUKE,
WHICH IS NORMALLY
A GOOD THING,

02:25.980 --> 02:27.270
BUT I WAS GETTING READY
TO PLAY GOLF

02:27.310 --> 02:28.770
AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE,

02:28.810 --> 02:31.020
I WAS GONNA PLAY GOLF WITH
A BUNCH OF FRIGGIN ARSE-HOLES.

02:31.060 --> 02:32.110
GOLF?

02:32.150 --> 02:34.360
SERIOUSLY, IS THIS
THE BEST USE OF OUR DAY?

02:34.400 --> 02:35.610
YEAH, OF COURSE IT IS.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.400
-IT'S GONNA BE FUN, MAN.
-FUN?

02:37.450 --> 02:40.320
THREE GROWN MEN CHASING
A LITTLE WHITE BALL AROUND.

02:40.370 --> 02:42.370
OH, YEAH. YES, B'Y.
GOOD TIMES.

02:42.410 --> 02:44.700
DON'T MIND HIM WALTER,
AND THANK YOU
FOR THE TEE TIME.

02:44.740 --> 02:46.290
OH, HEY, YOU KNOW, NO PROBLEM.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.460
I KNOW A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.500
UM, BUT, UH, AFTER GOLF,

02:49.540 --> 02:52.090
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE BIT
OF SAKE AND SUSHI AT BASHO?

02:52.670 --> 02:53.840
ON ME.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.840
SEE, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.630
WHY DO WE HAVE
TO GO PLAY THIS...

02:57.670 --> 02:58.930
STUPID GAME?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.090
IT'S NOT STUPID.

03:00.130 --> 03:02.470
IT'S A GAME OF PATIENCE,
INTELLIGENCE AND FOCUS.

03:02.510 --> 03:03.850
THINGS YOU SADLY LACK.

03:03.890 --> 03:05.220
SO YOU'VE PROVEN ONCE AGAIN

03:05.260 --> 03:07.430
WHAT A TERRIBLE FAILURE
YOU ARE AS A FATHER.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.270
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
SUCH A SUCK ABOUT IT,

03:09.310 --> 03:10.440
YOU CAN ALWAYS CADDY FOR ME.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.230
WHY DON'T YOU JUST START
BY RUNNING UPSTAIRS

03:12.270 --> 03:13.480
AND FETCHING THE GOLF BALLS?

03:13.520 --> 03:15.440
LOOK, JAKE,
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

03:15.480 --> 03:17.030
IT'S JUST, YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE...

03:17.070 --> 03:18.360
YOU COULD USE A BREAK, AND...

03:18.400 --> 03:20.610
AND IT'S A GREAT PLACE
TO TALK.

03:22.070 --> 03:24.330
YOU KNOW, SHARE?

03:25.950 --> 03:27.450
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING
SWISH AGAIN.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.370
LAY OFF HIM.
GO GET YOUR CLUBS.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.790
ALL RIGHT B'Y. DON'T HAVE
ANOTHER HEART ATTACK.

03:32.330 --> 03:34.460
OKAY. WHAT DID YOU FIND?

03:34.500 --> 03:35.380
ME.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.420
IN ALL MY GLORY.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.920
[MAURICE] AND THERE HE WAS,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,

03:39.970 --> 03:42.220
HIS FACE LIKE A BOILED BOOT.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.600
LOOKING FOR LOST SOULS, DOYLE?

03:48.270 --> 03:49.390
MAURICE BECKER.

03:50.390 --> 03:51.520
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.810
WHAT ELSE?

03:52.850 --> 03:54.270
WHA... WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

03:54.310 --> 03:57.280
OH, JUST SITTING HERE,
THINKING ABOUT
THE NATURE OF MAN.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.400
AND THAT LED ME TO YOU
FOR SOME REASON.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.030
ADEQUATE COMPENSATION
TO ACQUIRE THE SERVICES

04:05.070 --> 04:08.160
OF A SUB-STANDARD PRIVATE
DETECTIVE, WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

04:10.370 --> 04:11.540
[JAKE] OH...

04:11.580 --> 04:13.580
THIS IS TOO GENEROUS,
MR. BECKER.

04:13.620 --> 04:17.630
I'M NOT TALENTED ENOUGH
TO RECEIVE SUCH A BOUNTY.

04:17.670 --> 04:21.590
TRUE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY
TIME IS TIGHT

04:21.630 --> 04:23.340
AND YOU'RE MY ONLY OPTION.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.760
[JAKE] BOUNTY? BOUNTY?
WHAT AM I A PIRATE?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.260
&lt;REWINDING NOISE&gt;

04:28.010 --> 04:29.220
I HATE GOLF.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.520
-&lt;THWACK&gt;
-AH!

04:30.560 --> 04:33.060
FIRE IN THE HOLE,
DOYLE. HA HA.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.270
MAURICE BECKER.

04:34.310 --> 04:35.810
-&lt;LAUGH&gt;
-YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.150
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO PAY BACK
THAT DEBT YOU OWE ME, DOYLE.

04:39.190 --> 04:40.530
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
-IT'S TIME, DOYLE!

04:40.570 --> 04:42.240
TIME, TIME.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.530
BOTH OF YOU, HANDS UP!

04:46.490 --> 04:48.490
AND, UH, WHO ARE YOU
NOW EXACTLY?

04:48.530 --> 04:50.040
WHO AM I?

04:50.080 --> 04:52.210
I'M THE GUY HOLDING
A GUN TO YOU, MY FRIEND.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.460
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

04:53.500 --> 04:56.920
WELL, I'M THE GUY
THAT OWNS THE OFFICE
YOU JUST BROKE INTO.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.250
WHATEVER. HANDS UP.

04:58.290 --> 05:00.130
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-OH!

05:01.090 --> 05:02.170
-&lt;THUD&gt;
-AH!

05:02.220 --> 05:03.420
[LESLIE] SO THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.470
THIS ONE SAVES THE DAY?

05:04.510 --> 05:08.100
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; I HIT THE GUY
WITH THE GOLF BALL FIRST.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.350
AND I DISARMED HIM.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.600
UP! UP.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.930
UP, UP.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.060
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING
THIS LITTLE RUN-IN

05:15.100 --> 05:16.400
WASN'T A COINCIDENCE?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.360
NOTHING GETS BY YOU, DOYLE.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.400
WELL, I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO DO,

05:21.440 --> 05:23.490
AND THIS IS NOT A REQUEST.

05:23.530 --> 05:24.650
&lt;PRODDING NOISE&gt;

05:28.370 --> 05:30.620
WHO WAS YOUR FRIEND
BACK THERE?

05:30.660 --> 05:33.450
OH, JUST SOME
ARSE-HOLE VAGRANT WHO
THINKS I'VE WRONGED HIM.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.960
NOTHING FOR YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:35.790 --> 05:38.580
UH, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

05:38.630 --> 05:39.880
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

05:42.420 --> 05:44.130
WELL, THAT WAS DIRTY POOL.

05:44.170 --> 05:47.470
I'M TAKING YOU TO THE RNC,
AND I'M TURNING YOU IN.

05:47.510 --> 05:51.100
I HAVE A FRIEND THERE WHO
WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED
IN MEETING YOU,

05:51.140 --> 05:54.600
AND SHE'S REALLY,
REALLY BEAUTIFUL,
BY THE WAY.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.770
THAT'S A NICE TRY, DOYLE,
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HELP.

05:57.810 --> 05:59.400
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED,

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
THE WORDS
THAT I SAID, EXACTLY.

06:03.150 --> 06:05.190
YOU CAN'T TURN ME IN.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.320
NOW I'M BEGGING,
I'M BEGGING NOW.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.490
YOU WANT ME...

06:08.530 --> 06:10.320
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.620
WHAT DON'T I UNDERSTAND,
MAURICE?

06:12.660 --> 06:13.910
THE FACT THAT
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME,

06:13.950 --> 06:15.460
NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.580
UH, THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE A CON, AND...

06:17.620 --> 06:18.880
AND... AND A FUGITIVE?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.630
WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY
NOT UNDERSTAND?

06:22.710 --> 06:24.760
I... I... I HAVEN'T
GOT LONG TO LIVE.

06:27.090 --> 06:28.550
I'M DYING B'Y.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.560
I GOTTA BE HONEST,
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.230
-IS IT BAD?
-NO.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.230
IT'S THE GOOD TYPE
OF DYING, IDIOT.

06:40.770 --> 06:43.440
IT'S THE LIVER.
I GOT A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.940
MAURICE, I... I MEAN,
I PRETTY MUCH HATE YOUR GUTS,

06:45.990 --> 06:47.990
BUT I HAVE TO SAY I...

06:48.030 --> 06:49.410
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

06:49.450 --> 06:52.280
YEAH, WELL,
WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN,

06:52.330 --> 06:54.160
PUTS MATTERS IN PERSPECTIVE,
YOU KNOW?

06:54.200 --> 06:56.750
YOU HAVE TO RECONSIDER
ALL THE THINGS YOU DONE WRONG.

06:57.660 --> 06:58.960
GOTTA PUT THINGS RIGHT.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.330
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU.

07:00.370 --> 07:02.590
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
FIND MY NIECE

07:02.630 --> 07:04.420
AND RECONCILE, YOU KNOW?

07:04.460 --> 07:06.510
YOU... YOU REMEMBER KAREN?

07:06.550 --> 07:07.760
NO.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.590
YEAH, KAREN, B'Y. LOOK.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.680
OKAY, YES.
I REMEMBER HER, OKAY?

07:13.720 --> 07:15.600
FAMILY. YOU UNDERSTAND.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.350
IT'S THE PAST.

07:17.390 --> 07:20.140
WE NEED TO HEAL, B'Y.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.690
WE USED TO COME HERE.
WE'D PLAY WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.860
&lt;SIGH&gt; SAY I DO HELP YOU.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.690
DO YOU HAVE
A CLUE WHERE SHE IS?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.320
WELL, THERE WERE LOCALS
SHE USED TO FREQUENT.

07:31.610 --> 07:33.160
&lt;SIGH&gt;

07:34.450 --> 07:36.540
ALL RIGHT, MAURICE,
IF I DO THIS,

07:36.580 --> 07:37.870
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE

07:37.910 --> 07:41.710
THAT WHEN IT'S ALL OVER
YOU COME WITH ME QUIETLY
TO THE RNC...

07:41.750 --> 07:44.000
I... I... I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.710
I... I'D EVEN... I'D SWEAR
ON AL CAPONE'S HAT.

07:48.630 --> 07:49.880
OKAY.

07:51.010 --> 07:53.050
IS THAT TRUE,
ABOUT YOUR HEALTH?

07:53.090 --> 07:54.470
YEAH, IT IS.

07:54.510 --> 07:56.140
BUT I NEVER BEGGED. NEVER.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.350
I GOT PRIDE.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.600
BUT HE DID SAY
YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL,

07:59.640 --> 08:01.230
AND FOR THE RECORD YOU ARE.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.850
&lt;MUMBLING&gt;

08:02.900 --> 08:05.110
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I...
I WAS... I WAS THINKING...

08:05.150 --> 08:08.320
I WAS WONDERING
IF THE TWO US...

08:12.570 --> 08:13.700
[DES] OH, MAN, OH, MAN!

08:13.740 --> 08:15.120
JAKE WAS JUST
ARRESTED WITH MAURICE.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.370
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.330
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.500
ALL WE NEED,
ALL WE NEED IS A PLAN.

08:21.540 --> 08:22.710
[TINNY] OR YOU
COULD JUST RELAX.

08:22.750 --> 08:23.790
UNCLE JAKE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

08:23.830 --> 08:26.210
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.
OBVIOUSLY I KNOW THAT.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.880
UH, TINNY? HELLO, HI!

08:29.920 --> 08:31.880
YOU KNOW, IN SOME CULTURES
IT'S CONSIDERED RUDE

08:31.920 --> 08:34.590
TO BE TEXTING WHILE
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.890
&lt;CELL PHONE BEEPS&gt;

08:35.930 --> 08:37.680
SORRY.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.220
UM... I DON'T GET IT.
DID YOU JUST...

08:40.270 --> 08:41.640
DID YOU JUST SAY YOU'RE...

08:41.680 --> 08:43.140
DID YOU JUST APOLOGIZE
TO ME? I'M...

08:43.190 --> 08:44.560
I'M SUPER CONFUSED.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.730
WELL, DON'T GET USED TO IT.

08:45.770 --> 08:46.900
I WON'T.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.660
[JAKE] IT WAS
A DYING MAN'S WISH.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.910
WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO DO?

08:55.950 --> 08:57.910
PLUS I'M PARTLY RESPONSIBLE

08:57.950 --> 08:59.660
FOR HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIS NIECE.

08:59.700 --> 09:00.830
PARTLY?

09:00.870 --> 09:04.120
HE HAD A TETE-A-TETE WITH HER
DOWN IN ST. PIERRE.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.460
&lt;SIGHS&gt; JUST CONTINUE.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.710
THAT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.

09:08.750 --> 09:11.800
OKAY, LOOK, NOBODY HERE
RECOGNIZES KAREN.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.760
LET'S GO.
WE'VE WASTED ENOUGH TIME.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.180
WHOA! YOU FRIGGIN MEATHEAD.
YOU WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.350
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-OH!

09:19.390 --> 09:20.600
[JAKE] HANG ON.
THAT ISN'T EVEN CLOSE

09:20.640 --> 09:22.140
TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

09:22.180 --> 09:24.640
FIRST OF ALL, I DIDN'T EVEN
SEE THE GUY WHEN...

09:24.690 --> 09:26.060
-&lt;CRASH&gt;
-AH!

09:26.100 --> 09:27.730
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE.

09:27.770 --> 09:28.980
HORACE!

09:29.020 --> 09:30.610
IT'S MAURICE.

09:30.650 --> 09:32.570
HERE I WAS JUST
TELLING SOMEBODY,

09:32.610 --> 09:35.660
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS, ABOUT
ALL THE GREAT TIMES WE HAD.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.070
-WHAT?
-I'M SORRY TO DO THIS,

09:37.110 --> 09:38.700
BUT YOU'RE NOT
BOSS HERE ANY MORE.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.160
YOU WOULDN'T HURT A DYING MAN.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.790
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-&lt;CROWD EXCLAIMING&gt;

09:41.830 --> 09:44.580
UH, THAT... &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

09:44.620 --> 09:46.120
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO KNOCK YOU OUT.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.580
&lt;WHACK&gt;

09:48.960 --> 09:50.750
WOULD YOU CUT THE CRAP
AND GET TO WORK?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.050
AH!

09:54.170 --> 09:55.720
YOU COULD HAVE
TOLD ME THAT, UH,

09:55.760 --> 09:58.180
SAILOR WHITE USED
TO BE YOUR HEAVY.

09:58.220 --> 09:59.760
&lt;CELL PHONE BEEPING&gt;
OKAY.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.810
LOOK, OKAY? KAREN'S NUMBER.

10:01.850 --> 10:05.350
I GUESS THIS WHOLE TRIP WASN'T
A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

10:05.390 --> 10:08.310
WELL, I'LL NEVER LEAD YOU
ASTRAY, DOYLE.

10:08.350 --> 10:12.150
[MAURICE] NOW THE FACTS THAT
DOYLE IS DEPICTING ARE NOTHING

10:12.190 --> 10:16.240
BUT HALF-TRUTHS, FABRICATIONS,
BOLD FACED LIES.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.320
SAYS THE MAN WHO'S NIECE
WON'T EVEN TALK TO HIM.

10:19.370 --> 10:21.740
LOOK, YOU CAN BICKER
ALL YOU WANT.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.120
I'M NOT REFEREEING.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.290
I'M STRETCHING MY LEGS.

10:26.330 --> 10:30.630
YOU TWO FIGURE OUT YOUR STORY
BY THE TIME I GET BACK.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.710
-EVERYTHING OKAY?
-YEAH.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.590
THE ROOM'S JUST
FULL OF HOT AIR.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.680
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO, MAN. IT'S LIKE...

10:40.720 --> 10:42.470
IT'S LIKE SOPHIE'S CHOICE
OR SOMETHING HERE.

10:42.510 --> 10:44.390
WALTER, RELAX.
IT'LL WORK OUT.

10:44.430 --> 10:45.560
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?

10:45.600 --> 10:46.730
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY
I THINK IT WILL.

10:47.770 --> 10:49.940
BECAUSE THE SEX IS JUST...

10:49.980 --> 10:51.310
&lt;DEEP BREATH&gt;

10:51.730 --> 10:53.020
WHAT?

10:53.070 --> 10:54.730
UH, NO.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.900
I'M GONNA STOP TALKING NOW.

10:55.940 --> 10:57.070
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

10:57.110 --> 10:58.280
GOOD LAD.

11:02.660 --> 11:04.450
-EVERYTHING OKAY WITH JAKE?
-[MAL] I DON'T KNOW.

11:04.490 --> 11:06.410
LESLIE'S BEEN QUESTIONING HIM
FOR A WHILE.

11:06.450 --> 11:07.750
HOW ARE THINGS ON YOUR END?

11:07.790 --> 11:08.960
I'M, UH, SITTING TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
HOW MAURICE WAS GONNA
MAKE HIS GETAWAY.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.290
[MAL] I DON'T KNOW
WHAT JAKE'S AFTER,

11:12.330 --> 11:14.300
BUT I'M SURE IT'S SOMETHING.
KEEP ON IT.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.920
OKAY, I WILL. I'M JUST
HEADING TO THE AIRPORT NOW.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.170
I'LL CALL YOU BACK
AND FILL YOU IN.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.970
GREAT. GOTTA GO.

11:19.010 --> 11:20.260
LESLIE'S JUST STEPPED OUT.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.300
HOW'S JAKE DOING?

11:23.350 --> 11:24.850
HE'S A PAIN IN THE ARSE,
BUT HE'S FINE.

11:24.890 --> 11:26.220
IT'LL BE A BIT
TIL YOU CAN SEE HIM.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.810
HE STILL HAS TO
ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.940
-BEING DIFFICULT?
-JAKE?

11:29.980 --> 11:32.020
-NEVER.
-WELL, I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.320
UM, WELL, I'M...
I'M, I'M HIS LAWYER,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.650
SO OBVIOUSLY HE'S GOING
TO WANT TO CONSULT
WITH ME, RIGHT?

11:36.690 --> 11:37.900
I'M SORRY, WALTER,

11:37.940 --> 11:40.400
BUT FOR SOME REASON HE SAYS
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.860
OH, THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

11:41.910 --> 11:42.990
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

11:43.030 --> 11:44.490
ACTUALLY MAL,
CAN I BORROW YOU?

11:44.530 --> 11:46.870
MIGHT BE YOU CAN SHED
SOME LIGHT ON A FEW THINGS.

11:46.910 --> 11:48.580
-YEAH. OF COURSE.
-COME WITH ME.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.910
&lt;POLICE STATION CHATTER&gt;

11:51.000 --> 11:53.500
OKAY, MALACHY,
I GOTTA TELL YOU...

11:53.540 --> 11:54.750
JAKE IS DRIVING YOU BATTY.

11:54.790 --> 11:56.500
-YES. AND MAURICE IS...
-FULL OF CRAP.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.630
TO HIS EARS!

11:57.670 --> 11:59.260
SO YOU NEED MY TAKE
TO ILLUMINATE THINGS.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.800
PLEASE.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.140
IT STARTED OFF
AS THE BEST KIND OF DAY,

12:04.180 --> 12:05.930
NO JAKE IN SIGHT.

12:05.970 --> 12:09.020
BUT AS WE BOTH KNOW,
THAT NEVER LASTS FOR TOO LONG.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.270
OKAY, WELL, THAT
CLEARS UP PAYMENT

12:10.310 --> 12:12.940
FOR THE PETERSON/MYERS
CASE, AND, UH...

12:12.980 --> 12:14.190
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DONE.

12:14.230 --> 12:15.400
GREAT.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.650
I THINK WE'VE EARNED
THE AFTERNOON OFF.

12:17.690 --> 12:20.320
[DES] TINNY.
TINNY, FOCUS. FOCUS.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.610
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

12:21.650 --> 12:23.360
OH, DES IS ON
THE PHONE WITH TINNY,

12:23.410 --> 12:24.870
HELPING HER WITH HER HOMEWORK.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.490
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

12:26.530 --> 12:27.990
[JAKE] JUST MOVE IT.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.160
I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S A LONG STORY.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.540
YOU, SIT DOWN OUT OF IT.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.830
ROSE, DAD,
YOU REMEMBER MAURICE?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.420
-BECKER.
-[MAURICE] MALACHY.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.250
BEEN A WHILE.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.300
YOU LOOK FIT. WELL...

12:40.340 --> 12:42.380
SO, UH, YOU STILL TRYING
TO KILL US,

12:42.420 --> 12:44.550
OR WAS THAT
JUST A PASSING FANCY?

12:44.590 --> 12:45.930
[JAKE] MAURICE IS...

12:45.970 --> 12:48.180
WELL, HE NEEDS
OUR HELP WITH HIS NIECE.

12:48.220 --> 12:49.970
HE'S DYING. IT'S A LONG STORY.

12:50.020 --> 12:50.930
LIVER.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.350
-ROSE?
-MMM?

12:52.390 --> 12:54.190
THIS IS KAREN'S PHONE NUMBER,
ALL RIGHT?

12:54.230 --> 12:55.940
I NEED YOU TO BACK TRACK IT.

12:55.980 --> 12:57.520
IT'S OUT OF ORDER
OR SOMETHING.

12:57.570 --> 12:58.730
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

12:59.690 --> 13:00.860
DON'T DO NOTHING.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.990
[DES] IT'S SIMPLE, OKAY?

13:03.030 --> 13:05.030
STRING THEORY

13:05.070 --> 13:07.950
IS THE UNIFIED THEORY.

13:07.990 --> 13:09.540
I DON'T CARE.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.830
[DES] NO,
I DON'T CARE EITHER.

13:11.870 --> 13:13.620
OKAY, I'M LYING.
I REALLY, REALLY DO CARE.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.120
SO NONE OF THIS IS LANDING
ON YOU THOUGH, HUH?

13:15.170 --> 13:16.790
NOPE.

13:16.830 --> 13:20.550
WELL, UH, YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I'M NO LONGER
IN A RELATIONSHIP, UH...

13:20.590 --> 13:21.960
DES.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.470
WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE SINGLE.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.890
ALL ANYONE NEEDS TO DO
IS LOOK AT YOUR SWEATERS

13:25.930 --> 13:27.850
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE SINGLE.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.140
I'M KIDDING.

13:29.180 --> 13:33.930
YOUR SWEATERS AND
YOUR SWEATER VESTS
ARE SO HOT.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.270
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

13:35.310 --> 13:36.900
I DON'T... THINK SO.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.730
HELLO?

13:39.770 --> 13:40.900
HELLO?

13:41.900 --> 13:43.820
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?

13:43.860 --> 13:45.990
THAT GUY'S A FUGITIVE.
HE TRIED TO KILL US BOTH.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.490
BUT MAURICE IS UP
TO SOMETHING, OKAY?

13:47.530 --> 13:48.910
AND I'D RATHER HAVE HIM
IN MY SIGHTS

13:48.950 --> 13:51.200
THAN LURKING IN
THE SHADOWS SOMEWHERE.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.870
THIS IS ABOUT
THAT GIRL, ISN'T IT?

13:52.910 --> 13:55.710
-THIS IS ABOUT KAREN.
-NO. YES. NO. WHAT?

13:55.750 --> 13:58.830
PARTLY. LOOK,
MAURICE IS LOOKING FOR HER,

13:58.880 --> 14:01.000
WHICH ULTIMATELY MEANS
IT'S GONNA BE OUR PROBLEM.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.550
OKAY, I'LL CALL IN
SOME FAVORS,

14:02.590 --> 14:05.550
SEE IF ANYONE'S HEARD
ANY RUMBLINGS ABOUT MAURICE.

14:05.590 --> 14:08.220
GOOD. AND I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT, MALACHY DOYLE,

14:08.260 --> 14:10.600
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL FATHER.

14:13.390 --> 14:14.930
[MAL] SORRY.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.230
I WANT YOU TO LOOKING
INTO THIS, UH, GUY FOR ME.

14:17.270 --> 14:18.440
HANDSOME FELLA.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.060
WELL, I DON'T SEE IT, BUT...

14:20.110 --> 14:22.860
HE'S AFTER MAURICE
SO SEE WHAT YOU CAN DIG UP.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.150
YEAH, BUT REMEMBER, JAKE,

14:25.190 --> 14:27.910
KAREN MAYBE EASY ON THE EYE,
BUT SHE'S RUTHLESS.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.490
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-POINT TAKEN.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.030
WALTER, YEAH?

14:32.080 --> 14:34.750
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH,
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.960
[LESLIE] "BLAH BLAH BLAH"?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.710
JAKE'S ALWAYS GETTING
PHONE CALLS ABOUT NONSENSE.

14:38.750 --> 14:39.920
I TRY TO TUNE HIM OUT.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.880
I WOULD HAVE DIED FROM
A MIGRAINE YEARS AGO
IF I DIDN'T.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.880
SO IS LESLIE COMING BACK OR...

14:46.920 --> 14:48.720
SERGEANT BENNETT
IS INDISPOSED.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.760
THAT'D BE THE SMELL OF JAKE
THAT KEEPS HER AWAY.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.810
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU VISITED THE BAR?

14:54.850 --> 14:56.640
AFTER THE BAR
WE WENT TO MY OFFICE.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.940
HOLD IT, DOYLE.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.770
I'D RATHER HEAR THIS
FROM YOUR FRIEND.

14:59.810 --> 15:01.060
MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUE.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.150
GOOD MAN.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.650
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

15:05.690 --> 15:08.360
AH, SHE... TINNY... SHE...

15:08.400 --> 15:11.990
SHE DOESN'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND MY PASSION
FOR QUANTUM PHYSICS.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.120
I DON'T KNOW...

15:13.160 --> 15:14.120
ANYTHING...

15:14.160 --> 15:15.490
ABOUT ANYTHING.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.960
TINNY. IT'S A WOMAN, IS IT?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.040
[MAL] HMM. WELL,
LET ME TELL YOU,

15:20.080 --> 15:23.960
UNDERSTANDING ALL
OF THE MULTI-VERSE UNIVERSES

15:24.000 --> 15:27.130
THAT WE ARE LIKELY
TO INHABIT...

15:27.170 --> 15:31.680
IS A HELL OF A LOT EASIER
THAN FINDING OUR WAY
IN AND OUT

15:32.220 --> 15:33.930
OF THE FEMALE MIND.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.350
HERE.

15:35.390 --> 15:37.180
HEAD OVER TO THE COTTON CLUB.

15:37.220 --> 15:38.770
CONSIDER IT RESEARCH.

15:39.390 --> 15:40.560
I WILL.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.400
GOT SOMETHING?

15:42.440 --> 15:44.570
FOUND AN ADDRESS THAT
MATCHES THE PHONE NUMBER.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.360
IT'S, UH, A HELICOPTER HANGAR

15:46.400 --> 15:49.150
OUT BY THE AIRPORT REGISTERED
TO A COMPANY FROM ST. PIERRE.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.610
SADDLE UP.

15:51.660 --> 15:52.950
[JAKE] "SADDLE UP"?

15:52.990 --> 15:54.120
I WOULD NEVER SAY "SADDLE UP".

15:54.160 --> 15:55.370
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE, MCCLOUD?

15:55.410 --> 15:56.990
WELL, MAYBE I GOT
YOUR VERNACULAR WRONG,

15:57.040 --> 15:59.250
BUT I GOT YOUR TEMPERAMENT
RIGHT. SHUT UP.

16:02.370 --> 16:03.460
AH!

16:05.040 --> 16:06.880
YOU GOING OUT OF YOUR MIND?

16:06.920 --> 16:09.210
I CAN'T FIND
ANY RECORD OF KAREN

16:09.260 --> 16:11.010
BEING INVOLVED IN
THIS PLACE ANYWHERE.

16:12.380 --> 16:15.100
MAYBE IF YOU CHECKED
THE CLIENT DIRECTORY.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.640
THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.980
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

16:22.020 --> 16:24.020
IT'S TAKING SOME LONG TIME
FOR THIS THING TO BOOT UP.

16:24.060 --> 16:25.230
DON'T HIT IT.

16:25.270 --> 16:26.520
&lt;SMACKING&gt;

16:26.570 --> 16:30.110
COME ON. DO YOU ACTUALLY
THINK THAT I'D ACT THAT WAY?

16:30.150 --> 16:31.110
I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH

16:31.150 --> 16:33.200
THAT NOTHING'S BEYOND
THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.200
-&lt;SMACKING&gt;
-[MAURICE] OH, HANG ON.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.990
THAT LIGHT SUPPOSED
TO BE ON NORMALLY?

16:39.240 --> 16:41.540
MUST HAVE TRIGGERED
THE ALARM SOMEHOW.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.170
-SOMEHOW.
-&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

16:44.000 --> 16:46.130
UH... UH...

16:46.960 --> 16:48.250

16:48.300 --> 16:50.260
UH, WHEN THEY COME AROUND
THE CORNER, WE'LL JUST...

16:50.300 --> 16:51.760
WE'LL JUST...
WE'LL... WE'LL...

16:51.800 --> 16:53.630
&lt;WHACKING&gt;

16:53.680 --> 16:55.260
WHACK THEM OVER THE HEAD.

16:55.300 --> 16:56.510
MAYBE TALK TO THEM.

16:57.140 --> 16:58.310
&lt;FOOTSTEPS&gt;

17:01.060 --> 17:03.060
OH. &lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

17:03.100 --> 17:04.140
UH...

17:05.730 --> 17:07.150
HI, KAREN.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.070
IT'S, UH, GREAT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:09.110 --> 17:10.150
WHO ARE YOU?

17:10.480 --> 17:12.070
I'M JAKE.

17:12.110 --> 17:13.700
I'M JAKE DOYLE.

17:13.740 --> 17:14.860
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME?

17:16.870 --> 17:18.240
OH.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.160
PERHAPS THIS WILL
REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.130
THAT'S NOT WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED, IS IT?

17:32.170 --> 17:33.340
WELL...

17:33.380 --> 17:35.050
&lt;REWINDING NOISE&gt;

17:40.350 --> 17:42.180
WELL, KAREN.

17:43.180 --> 17:44.940
-IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
-MMM.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.810
TOO LONG, JAKE DOYLE,

17:46.850 --> 17:49.230
THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR MAN.

17:49.270 --> 17:50.570
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

17:50.610 --> 17:53.240
I WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME ABOUT YOU.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.570
YES, WELL,
IT'S MY BURDEN TO BEAR.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.340
SO WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER JAKE VISITED THE OFFICE?

18:12.380 --> 18:15.130
WELL, WITH NOT MUCH TO GO ON,
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS BEST.

18:15.170 --> 18:16.130
WHICH WAS?

18:16.170 --> 18:18.090
I FOLLOWED JAKE AND MAURICE.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.550
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

18:25.270 --> 18:26.480
[MAL] I ANSWERED THE CALL,

18:26.520 --> 18:28.190
AND THEN I SAW SOME MOVEMENT
BY THE HANGARS, AND...

18:28.230 --> 18:29.860
-WHO CALLED?
-OH, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.570
I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.780
-WALTER?
-UH, HOW'S IT HANGING?

18:34.740 --> 18:36.530
-YOU LOOKING FOR JAKE?
-[WALTER] UH, NO.

18:36.570 --> 18:37.910
HEY, NO, UH, NO.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.410
I'M JUST, UH, I'M SEEING
HOW YOU'RE DOING, BUDDY.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.290
I, UH, GOT A BOX FOR
AN UPCOMING ICE CAPS GAME.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.040
UH, WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU IN?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.960
HEY WALTER, I KNOW
ABOUT YOU AND KATHLEEN.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.170
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

18:49.210 --> 18:51.750
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:51.790 --> 18:54.210
HE KNOWS. HE KNOWS ABOUT US.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.920
SO WHAT?
LET'S JUST HAVE LUNCH.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.800
I SPENT A LARGE PART OF
MY LIFE AS AN INVESTIGATOR.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.140
&lt;MUMBLING&gt; WE WEREN'T TRYING
TO HIDE OR ANYTHING.

19:02.180 --> 19:04.390
IT JUST... IT KIND OF
HAPPENED, YOU KNOW?

19:04.430 --> 19:06.020
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.430
&lt;WHISPERING&gt; BE QUIET, YOU...

19:08.310 --> 19:11.400
HEY, DADDY. HI. YEAH.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.400
YOU KNOW, I'M A GROWN WOMAN,
AND I CAN MAKE MY OWN CHOICES.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.690
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

19:16.400 --> 19:18.360
YEAH. YUP.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.740
I, UH...

19:19.780 --> 19:21.110
LIKE, I THINK SO.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.240
WALTER'S BEEN A FRIEND TO
THIS FAMILY FOR A LONG TIME.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.740
JUST DO ME A FAVOR,
WHEN YOU BREAK UP WITH HIM,

19:24.790 --> 19:26.290
DON'T MAKE IT
MY PROBLEM, OKAY?

19:26.330 --> 19:27.330
[KATHLEEN] WOW,
THAT'S ENCOURAGING.

19:27.370 --> 19:29.370
-WHAT DID HE SAY?
-HE'S THRILLED.

19:29.410 --> 19:30.710
RIGHT!

19:30.750 --> 19:32.710
JAKE DOESN'T KNOW.
YOU SHOULD TELL HIM.

19:34.420 --> 19:35.340
'KAY.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.470
&lt;GIGGLE&gt;

19:39.720 --> 19:41.840
DADDY REALLY WANTS YOU
TO TELL JAKE.

19:43.470 --> 19:44.430
LET'S GO.

19:46.390 --> 19:48.600
WALTER'S DATING JAKE'S SISTER,

19:48.640 --> 19:50.100
AND JAKE DOESN'T KNOW IT?

19:50.140 --> 19:51.440
TRY NOT TO SOUND SO HAPPY.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.270
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

19:53.310 --> 19:54.690
SORRY. PLEASE CONTINUE.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.410
[MAL] WHERE ARE YOU, JAKE?

20:08.540 --> 20:09.870
JAKE?

20:10.500 --> 20:11.370
JAKE?

20:13.460 --> 20:14.920
SLEEPING ON THE JOB AGAIN?

20:14.960 --> 20:17.250
OH, NO, I'M AWAKE. I'M AWAKE.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.760
SO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR NAP,

20:19.800 --> 20:21.300
MAURICE OR KAREN?

20:24.930 --> 20:26.810
TOLD YOU
THAT GIRL WAS TROUBLE.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.020
LOOK, I CAN EXPECT
THIS KIND OF THING
FROM MAURICE,

20:29.060 --> 20:31.390
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT IT
FROM KAREN.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.640
YOU HAVE THAT EFFECT ON WOMEN.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.230
THEY LIKE IT BEST
WHEN YOU CAN'T SPEAK.

20:36.730 --> 20:38.650
OH, CRAP. I LOST THE GUN.

20:38.690 --> 20:40.070
YOU PACKING HEAT NOW?

20:40.110 --> 20:41.400
PACKING HEAT? NO, I'M NOT...

20:41.450 --> 20:44.110
THE GUN ISN'T MINE, OKAY?
IT WAS A LONG STORY.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.580
THIS IS ODD.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.200
[MAL] SO IS THIS...

20:50.450 --> 20:51.750
A PARKING TICKET.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.460
GUESS WHO'S NAME
IT'S MADE OUT IN?

20:55.500 --> 20:56.540
MAURICE BECKER.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.510
HOOD, WHAT HAPPENED?

21:00.550 --> 21:03.340
JAKE AND BECKER ARE
HAVING SOME DISAGREEMENTS.

21:05.510 --> 21:06.800
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

21:06.850 --> 21:08.350
DO I HAVE TO
REMIND YOU WHO I AM?

21:08.390 --> 21:09.510
A LIAR.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.020
YOU'RE LUCKY
I'M DYING, BROTHER.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.930
OH, YOU'RE DYING...
JUST CUT THE CRAP, ALL RIGHT?

21:12.980 --> 21:14.140
YOU'RE NOT EVEN SICK.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.100
YOU'RE BOTH GONNA BE
IF YOU DON'T SETTLE DOWN.

21:18.270 --> 21:19.400
HE STARTED IT.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.110
OH, CAREFUL.
I'M NOT WELL.

21:21.150 --> 21:22.440
YEAH, NOT IN THE HEAD.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.450
HOOD.

21:25.490 --> 21:27.320
TAKE MAURICE
TO INTERVIEW FOUR.

21:31.950 --> 21:33.210
SIT!

21:35.500 --> 21:39.420
NOW I WANT
THE REST OF THE STORY,

21:39.460 --> 21:41.510
NO INTERRUPTIONS.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.170
FINE.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.840
ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT
A MISSING MAURICE,

21:44.880 --> 21:47.140
AND A MISSING KAREN.
WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW?

21:47.180 --> 21:48.550
THAT MAURICE IS BACK IN TOWN

21:48.600 --> 21:50.390
CLAIMING TO BE DYING
FROM SOME MALADY,

21:50.430 --> 21:52.890
-AND LOOKING FOR KAREN.
-[ROSE] YEAH, WELL,
I'VE ASKED AROUND.

21:52.930 --> 21:55.480
APPARENTLY THERE'S
NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN
NIECE AND UNCLE.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.190
WHAT ABOUT
OUR FRENCH FRIEND HERE.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.070
OH, UH, I CHECKED
THE CRIMINAL DATABANK,

22:02.110 --> 22:03.360
BUT I COULDN'T FIND
ANYTHING ON GUY

22:03.400 --> 22:05.950
BUT HE...
HE'S FUNNY LOOKING, HUH?

22:05.990 --> 22:07.570
I BET HE GETS DUMPED
ALL THE TIME.

22:07.610 --> 22:09.240
I FIND HIM FUNNY LOOKING TOO.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.870
-OH, YEAH.
-YEAH.

22:10.910 --> 22:12.790
AND HE WAS PACKING HEAT.

22:12.830 --> 22:15.410
HE'S GOT A BEEF
AGAINST MAURICE.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.080
NOW HORACE HERE IS PRETTY
MUCH KAREN'S LIEUTENANT,

22:18.130 --> 22:19.630
THE SAME JOB AS HE USED
TO DO FOR MAURICE.

22:19.670 --> 22:21.960
AND THE HELICOPTER HANGAR
YOU AND MAURICE WENT TO,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.170
KAREN OWNS IT.
SEEMS SHE'S GONE LEGIT.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.800
PFFT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
SHE DID DRUG ME.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.010
OH, AND I GOT A HIT
ON THE PARKING TICKET.

22:28.050 --> 22:30.390
MAURICE RECENTLY BOUGHT A CAR
AT A USED CAR DEALERSHIP.

22:30.430 --> 22:32.970
GOOD. MAYBE THEY KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT MAURICE
WE DON'T.

22:33.010 --> 22:34.220
LET'S GO.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.560
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST GONNA SKIP AHEAD NOW.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.810
WHY?

22:39.860 --> 22:41.480
I ALREADY KNOW ABOUT
KATHLEEN AND WALTER.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.530
&lt;SIGH&gt;

22:44.570 --> 22:47.650
SO, BUDDY, WHAT IS IT
YOU WANTED TO TALK
TO ME ABOUT?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.660
YEAH, I GOT...
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.410
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?

22:53.450 --> 22:55.120
OF COURSE. WALTER, LOOK.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.710
YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND
A GUY COULD EVER HAVE,
ALL RIGHT?

22:57.750 --> 23:00.380
WHATEVER YOU HAVE
TO TELL ME, IT'S FINE.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.550
I'M DATING YOUR SISTER.

23:04.590 --> 23:05.760
I'M DATING KATHLEEN.

23:06.590 --> 23:07.970
THAT'S AWESOME.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.550
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.640
I'M SO HAPPY FOR
BOTH OF YOU. CHEERS.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.680
[LESLIE] JAKE, DO YOU REALLY
EXPECT ME TO BUY THAT?

23:14.720 --> 23:16.100
YOU PUNCHED HIM.

23:16.140 --> 23:17.180
WHAT?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.520
I SAW WALTER
AND HIS BLACK EYE,

23:19.560 --> 23:21.100
AND I KNOW HOW
YOU CAN GET WITH FAMILY.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.570
HOLD ON, HOLD ON. OKAY,
KATHLEEN IS MY SISTER,
ALL RIGHT?

23:23.610 --> 23:25.070
I'M HER BROTHER.

23:25.110 --> 23:26.690
NOT HER BOYFRIEND.

23:26.740 --> 23:27.860
I'M DATING KATHLEEN.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.570
COME ON, JAKE.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.200
IT'S... IT'S NOT SUCH
A BIG DEAL, MAN. IT'S LIKE...

23:35.240 --> 23:37.500
[LESLIE] SO WALTER JUST
WALKED INTO A DOOR?

23:37.540 --> 23:39.500
HOW ELSE DO YOU THINK
HE GOT THE BLACK EYE?

23:40.540 --> 23:42.330
JUST FINISH THE STORY.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.500
&lt;SIGH&gt;

23:43.540 --> 23:46.420
&lt;SPEAKING FRENCH&gt;

23:46.460 --> 23:49.970
JUST WAIT A SECOND.
WHY ARE THEY TALKING
ABOUT BOOKS AND PENS?

23:50.010 --> 23:52.640
WELL, THEY'RE NOT. I JUST...
MY FRENCH ISN'T VERY GOOD.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.720
I HAD TO STOP AT GRADE NINE,

23:54.760 --> 23:57.520
BUT I HAD A REALLY
HOT FRENCH TEACHER.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.560
WHATEVER. CONTINUE.

24:00.140 --> 24:01.310
&lt;GROAN&gt;

24:02.310 --> 24:03.810
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.320
YOU IDIOT.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.320
-YOU'RE A COP?
-OUI.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.610
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

24:14.700 --> 24:16.660
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

24:16.700 --> 24:18.540

24:21.790 --> 24:23.120
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

24:23.170 --> 24:25.670
IF I WANTED YOU KILLED,
YOU'D BE DEAD BY NOW.

24:25.710 --> 24:26.750
GIVE ME THAT.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.130
[MAURICE] DON'T HURT YOURSELF.

24:28.170 --> 24:29.510
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

24:30.720 --> 24:32.340
GOD, I HATE GUNS.

24:32.380 --> 24:34.470
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME
MUCH TO WORK WITH.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.010
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

SHOWED UP,

24:56.620 --> 24:59.040
SO CAN I GET OUT OF
THESE CUFFS NOW, PLEASE?

25:00.620 --> 25:01.710
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.160

26:00.680 --> 26:02.390
HE'S INVOLVED IN, UH,

26:02.430 --> 26:04.930
RUM AND SPIRIT SMUGGLING
INTO QUEBEC,

26:04.980 --> 26:07.020
AND HE GOT AWAY
BEFORE WE COULD GET HIM.

26:07.060 --> 26:10.150
LESLIE, DID YOU GET
BECKER'S FULL STORY YET, OR...

26:10.190 --> 26:12.480
UH, YEAH, WE...

26:12.530 --> 26:14.570
WE JUST WANTED
TO GET YOUR STORY FIRST.

26:14.610 --> 26:16.400
[JAKE] REALLY?

26:16.450 --> 26:18.780
WELL, I'D LIKE TO BE THERE
WHEN YOU GET THE...

26:19.660 --> 26:21.280
THE REST OF HIS.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.490
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

26:26.920 --> 26:32.210
WHAT WE'RE DEFINITELY
NOT LOOKING FOR IS PLANE,
BUS OR BOAT.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.010
THEY NEED SOMETHING
TO GET THEM OFF THE ISLAND.

26:34.050 --> 26:35.760
YEAH. OH, WELL,
I'LL KEEP SEARCHING.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.720
BYE, BABE.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.590
-HEY.
-[ROSE] HEY.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.350
LISTEN, WE NEED YOU GUYS
TO GO STAKE OUT A BAR.

26:42.390 --> 26:43.930
JAKE MET A GUY THERE
NAMED HORACE,

26:43.970 --> 26:45.930
AND IF HE SHOWS UP AGAIN
HE MAY LEAD US TO KAREN.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.190
A BAR?

26:47.230 --> 26:48.810
ARE YOU SURE
WE CAN GO IN THERE?

26:48.850 --> 26:50.480
OH, KNOCK IT OFF.
I KNOW YOU HAVE A FAKE I.D.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.980
WHAT? TINNY, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

26:53.020 --> 26:55.190
AND I KNOW
WHO MADE IT FOR HER.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.450
WHAT? THAT'S NOT...

26:57.490 --> 26:58.530
TRUE.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.450
COME ON.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.830
OKAY.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.950
CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THIS B.S.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.660
[JAKE] THAT'S ONE THING
WE CAN AGREE ON.

27:09.870 --> 27:11.460
THAT COP, UH, LESLIE. SHE'S...

27:11.500 --> 27:13.550
AH! JUST SHUT UP.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.880
[MAURICE] I HAD JUST
LEFT THE HANGAR.

27:18.930 --> 27:20.510
[LESLIE] YOU DIDN'T STAY
TO SEE YOUR NIECE

27:20.550 --> 27:21.890
WHO YOU'D BEEN SEARCHING FOR?

27:21.930 --> 27:23.850
-[MAURICE] NO.
-&lt;GUY SCOFFS&gt;

27:23.890 --> 27:25.220
I WAS AFRAID, YOU KNOW?

27:25.270 --> 27:26.680
I WAS TOO EMBARRASSED
TO FACE HER

27:26.720 --> 27:28.480
FOR ALL THE WRONGS I HAD DONE.

27:30.770 --> 27:32.360
[KAREN] UNCLE MAURICE!

27:35.980 --> 27:37.780
&lt;SPEAKING FRENCH&gt;

27:46.790 --> 27:47.870
MAURICE, NON.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.460
[JAKE] &lt;SHOUTING&gt;
NOT SO FAST!

27:50.500 --> 27:51.620
[MAURICE] RUN KAREN!

27:53.000 --> 27:54.670
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

28:00.970 --> 28:03.180
ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY
BULLETS WAS THAT?

28:03.220 --> 28:05.600
WHAT? I... I... I DON'T KNOW.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.390
JUST MAKE IT STOP.

28:07.430 --> 28:08.890
-&lt;GUN SHOT&gt;
-[JAKE] THAT LIAR.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.190
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:12.230 --> 28:14.770
-TELL THE TRUTH.
-I AM, COP!

28:14.810 --> 28:15.730
I DIDN'T FIRE ON YOU.

28:15.770 --> 28:17.820
OKAY, JUST TAKE IT EASY,
ALL RIGHT, PALLY?

28:17.860 --> 28:19.070
YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE, GUY.

28:19.110 --> 28:20.820
&lt;SPEAKING FRENCH&gt;
I SHOULD WHAT?

28:20.860 --> 28:23.200
STAY OUT THERE AND LET
THIS SCUM LIE ABOUT ME?

28:23.240 --> 28:24.370
&lt;SPEAKING FRENCH&gt;

28:26.870 --> 28:27.790
[MAURICE] OH, GOD.

28:27.830 --> 28:29.580
WHAT'S WRONG, MAURICE?
ARE YOU DYING?

28:37.090 --> 28:38.550
OH...

28:42.010 --> 28:44.340
ANYONE WANNA
CALL AN AMBULANCE, OR...

28:44.390 --> 28:45.640
&lt;AMBULANCE SIREN&gt;

28:46.720 --> 28:48.140
MAURICE IS FINE.

28:48.180 --> 28:49.970
THE DOCTORS COULDN'T FIND
ANYTHING PHYSICALLY WRONG
WITH HIM,

28:50.020 --> 28:52.100
BUT THEY WANT TO KEEP HIM
OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.270
SO HE WAS FAKING. I KNEW IT.

28:54.310 --> 28:55.810
THAT'S FINE.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.770
AS LONG AS HE COMES BACK
TO QUEBEC WITH ME.

28:57.820 --> 28:58.780
[LESLIE] ABOUT THAT...

28:58.820 --> 29:00.940
MAURICE STAYS HERE.

29:00.990 --> 29:01.950
I'M SORRY.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.830
I UNDERSTAND.

29:08.870 --> 29:10.910
HOW CAN I BE MAD
AT SOMEONE SO BEAUTIFUL?

29:12.580 --> 29:13.830
CAN I SEE MAURICE?

29:14.750 --> 29:16.580
YEAH. OF COURSE.

29:21.970 --> 29:22.920
OF COURSE.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.640
YOU KNOW, YOUR NEW...

29:26.680 --> 29:28.470
BOYFRIEND IS BECOMING
A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS.

29:28.510 --> 29:30.600
MAYBE I SHOULD ASK HIM OUT.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.390
HE IS BEAU ET CHARMANT.

29:33.430 --> 29:36.520
WELL, PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME
I CAN BE VERY BEAU ET CHARMANT

29:36.560 --> 29:37.860
AS WELL,

29:37.900 --> 29:40.820
BUT I DON'T RUN AROUND
CHARMANTING IT IN,

29:40.860 --> 29:42.860
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE'S FACES.

29:51.370 --> 29:52.750
HE'S GONE.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.370
MAURICE ESCAPED.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.080
GUY, CHECK ROOM BY ROOM.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.540
HE COULDN'T HAVE GOT FAR
WITHOUT HELP.

29:59.590 --> 30:00.800
I'LL PHONE IT IN.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.960
LOCK THIS WHOLE HOSPITAL
DOWN, NOW!

30:04.260 --> 30:05.510
[DES] OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

30:05.550 --> 30:06.800
SO MAROON,

30:08.010 --> 30:09.970
OR HORIZONTAL STRIPED?

30:10.010 --> 30:12.350
THE MAROON REALLY ACCENTUATES
MY SLENDER FIGURE,

30:12.390 --> 30:14.230
AND THE STRIPES
REALLY DO... OH!

30:14.270 --> 30:15.560
WHATCHA DOING?

30:15.600 --> 30:18.350
UM, I'M JUST, UH...

30:18.400 --> 30:20.150
PREPARING FOR
AN UPCOMING STAKEOUT.

30:20.190 --> 30:21.940
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE BAD GUYS CAN'T SEE ME.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.030
YOU'RE TRYING TO
LOOK GOOD FOR A GIRL.

30:24.070 --> 30:25.650
-HOW'D YOU KNOW?
-WELL, YOU KNOW.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.570
HERE. YOU GOT A MINUTE?

30:27.610 --> 30:28.950
JUST COME WITH ME.

30:29.910 --> 30:31.700
OKAY.

30:31.740 --> 30:36.500
I THINK TINNY MIGHT,
LIKE, "LIKE" ME.

30:36.540 --> 30:37.920
OKAY, WELL,
YOU GOTTA GET IN THERE,

30:37.960 --> 30:39.830
BECAUSE GUYS LIKE US,

30:39.880 --> 30:42.250
WE GOTTA TAKE
THESE OPPORTUNITIES
WHERE WE CAN GET THEM.

30:42.300 --> 30:45.510
&lt;LAUGHS&gt; I'VE BEEN KNOWN
TO CAPTURE A LADY OR TWO.

30:45.550 --> 30:47.010
WHAT LIKE, LIKE ILLEGALLY?

30:47.050 --> 30:49.340
NO! NO, LIKE CAPTURE
THEIR HEARTS.

30:49.390 --> 30:50.930
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

30:50.970 --> 30:54.350
IT'S JUST YOU HAVE
TO DO EVERYTHING IN
YOUR POWER TO GET TINNY

30:54.390 --> 30:55.810
OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE ALONE.

30:55.850 --> 30:57.480
OKAY.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.480
OKAY! YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT. YEAH!

30:59.520 --> 31:02.020
I'M NOT GOING TO LET
MY FEAR OF JAKE OR MAL OR ROSE

31:02.070 --> 31:05.110
OR KATHLEEN OR YOU OR
TINNY HERSELF GET IN MY WAY.

31:05.150 --> 31:06.280
YEAH! THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

31:06.320 --> 31:08.070
YEAH!

31:08.110 --> 31:09.280
HOW'D YOU GET
THAT BLACK EYE AGAIN?

31:09.320 --> 31:10.780
I TOLD JAKE
I WAS DATING KATHLEEN.

31:10.820 --> 31:11.990
RIGHT.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.870
OH, I'M SO DEAD.

31:13.910 --> 31:15.240
HEY, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.410
NOTHING.

31:17.460 --> 31:21.380
HEY, UM, BY THE WAY,
SERGEANT BENNETT... LESLIE...

31:21.420 --> 31:23.710
UH, DO YOU KNOW
IF SHE'S, UH, DATING ANYONE?

31:23.750 --> 31:27.130
YES. SHE HAS
A BIG, UH, BOYFRIEND.

31:27.170 --> 31:30.300
HE PLAYS HOCKEY
WITH THE FLATROCK FLYERS.

31:30.340 --> 31:32.100
GOON. FORWARD CHOPPER.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.060
VERY VIOLENT.
I'D STAY CLEAR IF I WAS YOU.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.140
[GUY] I SEE.

31:35.180 --> 31:37.020
I... I THOUGHT
SHE WAS GIVING ME SIGNALS.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.270
I DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNALS.

31:38.310 --> 31:39.480
NO?

31:39.520 --> 31:41.770
THIS WHOLE THING RIGHT NOW,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

31:41.810 --> 31:44.110
WE SHOULD BE OUT THERE
LOOKING FOR MAURICE,

31:44.150 --> 31:45.480
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

31:50.070 --> 31:51.160
&lt;GROANING&gt;

31:57.200 --> 31:59.120
THIS GUY IS A KNOB.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.790
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT HIM.

32:00.830 --> 32:02.830
BESIDES THE FACT THAT
LESLIE LIKES HIM BETTER
THAN YOU?

32:02.880 --> 32:04.460
OH, YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.960
WHAT DO YOU GOT ON HIM?
HE ATTACKED ME!

32:06.000 --> 32:08.090
I KNOW HE'S WORKING
FOR MAURICE.

32:08.130 --> 32:09.090
ROSE IS LOOKING INTO IT.

32:09.130 --> 32:11.180
IN THE MEANTIME, ONE OF
MY OLD FRIENDS SENT ME THIS.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.340
WHAT IS IT?

32:12.390 --> 32:13.470
[MAL] IT'S A COPY
OF THE CASE

32:13.510 --> 32:15.600
THE CROWN'S PUTTING
TOGETHER AGAINST KAREN.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.890
HER LEGITIMATE HELICOPTER
BUSINESS IS NOT SO LEGITIMATE.

32:18.930 --> 32:21.390
SHE'S USING THE HELICOPTERS
TO SMUGGLE RUM.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.310
MAN, SHE IS SMART
AND ATTRACTIVE.

32:23.350 --> 32:25.110
RNC HAVE A WARRANT
OUT FOR KAREN,

32:25.150 --> 32:26.690
SO SHE RARELY
LEAVES ST. PIERRE,

32:26.730 --> 32:29.360
ONLY WHEN SHE IS OVERSEEING
A LARGE CONSIGNMENT OF RUM.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.700
WORD ON THE STREET IS
SHE GOT ONE JUST DAYS AGO,

32:31.740 --> 32:34.950
AND SHE TRADED HER RUM
FOR A LOAD OF BEARER BONDS.

32:34.990 --> 32:38.120
MAYBE SHE'S TAKING THOSE BONDS
BACK TO ST. PIERRE RIGHT NOW.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.410
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY MAURICE IS HERE TOO.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.000
HE'S AFTER THE BONDS,
NOT KAREN.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.460
GUYS, I JUST TALKED TO

32:44.500 --> 32:46.840
GUY'S CAPTAIN AT
THE QUEBEC POLICE FORCE.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.170
TURNS OUT
HE'S NOT ON ASSIGNMENT.

32:49.210 --> 32:50.300
HE'S HERE ON VACATION.

32:50.340 --> 32:53.630
SO THE DOUCHE COP
FROM QUEBEC HAS GONE ROGUE.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.140
HM, A GOOD LOOKING
ONE TOO, EH?

32:55.180 --> 32:57.220
HUH. AND GET THIS.

32:57.260 --> 32:59.270
THE POLICE ALSO FOUND
HIS ABANDONED CAR RENTAL

32:59.310 --> 33:02.190
AT THE CORNER OF PORTUGAL COVE
AND MACDONALD DRIVE.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.230
THAT'S RIGHT
BY KAREN'S HANGAR.

33:04.270 --> 33:05.230
LET'S GO.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.400
&lt;FOG HORN BLOWING&gt;

33:10.320 --> 33:12.070
[MAL] LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE TOO LATE.

33:12.110 --> 33:13.200
MAN, I THOUGHT WE HAD HIM.

33:14.450 --> 33:15.740
&lt;COINS FALLING&gt;

33:18.990 --> 33:20.120
THAT'S WEIRD.

33:21.790 --> 33:23.160
&lt;MUFFLED PLEAS&gt;

33:24.250 --> 33:25.540
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

33:25.580 --> 33:27.250
&lt;MUFFLED TALKING&gt;

33:27.290 --> 33:30.380
[JAKE] MAN, WHAT DOES
LESLIE SEE IN YOU?

33:30.420 --> 33:31.960
&lt;MUFFLED TALKING&gt;

33:36.260 --> 33:38.050
WHERE'S MAURICE?

33:38.100 --> 33:40.220
I DON'T KNOW.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.520
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY,
BECAUSE WE'RE PRETTY SURE

33:41.560 --> 33:42.680
YOU HELPED HIM ESCAPE.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.190
HEY!

33:44.230 --> 33:45.480
I BROUGHT HIM... &lt;GROAN&gt;

33:45.520 --> 33:46.980
I BROUGHT HIM HERE...

33:48.110 --> 33:50.110
BUT THEN HORACE
GOT THE JUMP ON ME.

33:50.150 --> 33:51.070
HORACE?

33:51.110 --> 33:53.990
-ISN'T HE KAREN'S MAN?
-YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

33:54.030 --> 33:55.360
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT WHEN I WOKE UP

33:55.400 --> 33:57.780
I WAS HANGING FROM THE STAIRS

33:57.820 --> 33:59.660
AND BOTH HIM AND MAURICE
WERE GONE.

33:59.700 --> 34:01.080
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

34:01.120 --> 34:03.040
MAURICE PAYING YOU OFF?

34:03.080 --> 34:04.870
WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT
ON SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT.

34:06.710 --> 34:08.460
OH, HE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK. I SEE.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.750
HEY! HEY! HEY!

34:10.800 --> 34:13.510
WHAT THE HELL?
LET ME DOWN!

34:13.550 --> 34:16.630
TALK OR I'LL DROP YOU
ON YOUR HEAD.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.010
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

34:18.050 --> 34:19.640
TRY US.

34:19.680 --> 34:22.430
&lt;GROAN&gt; MAURICE IS
LIKE MY WHITE MALE.

34:23.930 --> 34:25.140
UH...

34:25.180 --> 34:26.770
YOU... YOUR WHITE WHAT?

34:26.810 --> 34:27.900
MY WHITE MALE.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.520
YOU MEAN WHITE WHALE.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.230
&lt;SPEAKING FRENCH&gt;

34:31.270 --> 34:33.280
LOOK, I'VE BEEN WORKING
THIS CASE FOR YEARS,

34:33.320 --> 34:36.070
BUT HE...
BUT HE KEEPS SLIPPING AWAY.

34:36.110 --> 34:37.780
WHEN I LEARNED
THAT HE WAS HERE,

34:37.820 --> 34:40.450
I TOOK SOME TIME OFF
AND I DECIDED TO COME HERE

34:40.490 --> 34:43.080
AND GET HIM
AND BRING HIM TO QUEBEC.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.160
[MAL] I CAN COMMISERATE.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.040
THERE'S ALWAYS THAT
ONE CASE FOR EVERY COP.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.920
BUT IF MAURICE IS YOURS,
WHY'D YOU HELP HIM
BREAK OUT OF THE HOSPITAL?

34:48.960 --> 34:50.670
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;
&lt;SPEAKING IN FRENCH&gt;

34:51.670 --> 34:53.130
I'M AN IDIOT.

34:53.170 --> 34:55.090
I CUT A DEAL WITH HIM.

34:55.130 --> 34:57.430
I'D HELP HIM
GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL

34:57.470 --> 35:01.140
AND LET HIM TIE UP
A LOOSE END,

35:01.180 --> 35:04.180
AND IN EXCHANGE HE'D COME BACK
TO QUEBEC WITH ME.

35:04.220 --> 35:06.270
BUT HE DIDN'T KEEP
HIS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN.

35:06.310 --> 35:08.140
WOW. THAT WAS...

35:08.480 --> 35:09.730
REALLY STUPID.

35:09.770 --> 35:10.810
YOU'RE STUPID.

35:10.860 --> 35:13.230
YEAH, WHO WOULD FALL
FOR MAURICE'S LIES?

35:13.270 --> 35:14.530
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

35:14.570 --> 35:16.990
HEY, JUST LET HIM DOWN,
ALL RIGHT, BEFORE
HE STARTS TO CRY.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.070
[JAKE] YEAH?

35:20.110 --> 35:21.450
UNCLE JAKE, WE HAVE
MOVEMENT AT THE BAR.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.200
DID HORACE COME BACK?

35:24.240 --> 35:25.290
NO, KAREN.

35:25.330 --> 35:27.580
SHE JUST WALKED IN CARRYING
A LARGE DUFFLE BAG.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.250
OKAY, GOOD.
CALL ME, ALL RIGHT,
IF ANYTHING CHANGES.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.380
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. UM...

35:35.590 --> 35:36.800
DO YOU EAT?

35:36.840 --> 35:38.300
-CALM DOWN NOW.
-NO, NO.

35:38.340 --> 35:39.840
I MEAN, UH... I MEAN, UM...

35:39.880 --> 35:43.350
UH, WE COULD GET SOME FOOD,

35:43.390 --> 35:46.640
JUST TO CELEBRATE
THE, UH, THE STAKEOUT.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.180
ARE YOU ASKING ME OUT?

35:48.230 --> 35:50.350
WHAT? NO. NO.

35:50.390 --> 35:51.400
NO! &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

35:51.440 --> 35:52.940
NO. WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

35:52.980 --> 35:54.360
I MEAN, THAT'S CRAZY.
THAT'S STUPID.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.570
YOU'D HAVE TO BE...

35:55.610 --> 35:56.820
&lt;CELL PHONE CHIMING&gt;

35:57.900 --> 35:59.070
WHOA!

35:59.110 --> 36:00.200
EYES OFF, DESSIE.

36:03.700 --> 36:06.700
WELL, I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

36:06.740 --> 36:09.620
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT A LEAD
ON YOUR, UH, WHITE MALE.

36:09.660 --> 36:10.830
HA-HA. FUNNY.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.830
HA-HA, FUNNY. I GET THE JOKE.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.250
IT MUST BE TOUGH
FOR YOU, HUH, THOUGH,

36:14.290 --> 36:16.170
NOT TALKING EITHER
OFFICIAL LANGUAGE?

36:16.210 --> 36:17.630
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

36:17.670 --> 36:19.970
KAREN WAS SPOTTED BACK
AT HORACE'S BAR.

36:20.010 --> 36:22.510
PROBABLY MEETING HORACE BEFORE
HEADING BACK TO ST. PIERRE.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.260
THEN THAT'S WHERE MAURICE IS.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.270
I HEARD HIM TALKING TO
HORACE ABOUT GETTING

36:27.310 --> 36:29.560
KAREN'S BONDS BEFORE I,
UH, PASSED OUT.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.940
LET'S GO.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.770
OKAY, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

36:34.810 --> 36:36.190
&lt;SPEAKING FRENCH&gt;

36:42.280 --> 36:43.740
[JAKE] WELL, WELL, WELL.

36:43.780 --> 36:46.160
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN STOOD UP.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.830
TRUST ME. I'VE BEEN THERE.

36:47.870 --> 36:49.950
THAT DOESN'T
SURPRISE ME AT ALL.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.290
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

36:51.330 --> 36:54.670
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
IT ISN'T YOUR BEARER BONDS.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.420
HUH, IF IT'S ME YOU'RE AFTER,

36:56.460 --> 36:59.420
I AM WAY, WAY OUT
OF YOUR LEAGUE.

36:59.460 --> 37:00.550
&lt;GROANS&gt;

37:01.300 --> 37:02.720
HANDS UP.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.340
&lt;EXCITED BAR CHATTER&gt;

37:06.470 --> 37:07.560
&lt;BOTH GRUNTING&gt;

37:11.350 --> 37:12.810
WELCOME TO CANADA.

37:12.850 --> 37:14.900
I WAS BORN HERE.

37:14.940 --> 37:17.020
-THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING.
-INDEED.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.190
-WHAT A CLICHE.
-TOTALLY.

37:20.230 --> 37:21.440
[BOTH] WHAT?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.200
LET GO.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.910
&lt;DUFFLE BAG UNZIPPING&gt;

37:27.950 --> 37:29.370
&lt;HANDCUFFS CLICKING&gt;

37:30.910 --> 37:32.500
NICE MOVES.

37:32.540 --> 37:33.370
NICE.

37:37.460 --> 37:38.630
WHAT'S THIS?

37:40.670 --> 37:42.090
TOURIST PAMPHLETS?

37:42.130 --> 37:43.300
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

37:43.340 --> 37:44.430
WHERE'S THE BEARER BONDS?

37:44.470 --> 37:45.550
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

37:46.220 --> 37:47.680
HE BEAT US HERE.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.850
MAURICE!

37:51.770 --> 37:52.980
HELLO?

37:53.020 --> 37:54.640
DID YOU GET MY PRESENT, DOYLE?

37:54.690 --> 37:56.850
YOU SHOULD REALLY COME
AND SPEND A WEEKEND, YOU KNOW?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.610
THE RUM IS TO DIE FOR.

37:58.650 --> 37:59.980
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

38:00.020 --> 38:01.440
HOW DID YOU STEAL THE BONDS?

38:01.480 --> 38:03.820
[MAURICE] OH, THAT LITTLE GEM.
WELL, THAT WAS SIMPLE.

38:03.860 --> 38:06.740
YOU WERE SO WILLING TO BELIEVE

38:06.780 --> 38:10.330
THAT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE
AMENDS WITH A NIECE LIKE KAREN

38:10.370 --> 38:12.450
THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.870
I STOLE HER BONDS AGES AGO.

38:14.910 --> 38:16.120
[MAURICE] I DID NEED YOUR HELP

38:16.170 --> 38:17.420
TO FIND OUT
WHERE KAREN WAS STAYING,

38:17.460 --> 38:20.840
BUT OUR TRIP TO THE BAR
HAD ANOTHER MOTIVE.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.460
I NEEDED HORACE'S SERVICES.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.260
I KNEW HE WAS UNHAPPY
WITH KAREN

38:25.300 --> 38:28.800
SO I PERSUADED HIM
TO FLIP TO MY CAUSE.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.890
HE'D BE ALMOST AS
HELPFUL AS YOU WERE.

38:30.930 --> 38:32.180
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

38:32.220 --> 38:33.470
[MAURICE] I KNEW
YOU'D FIND KAREN,

38:33.520 --> 38:35.520
BUT THAT YOU'D CREATE
A DISTRACTION

38:35.560 --> 38:37.350
THAT WOULD ALLOW ME
TO GRAB THE BONDS.

38:38.770 --> 38:41.770
HOWEVER, MY LUCK
WOULDN'T HOLD.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.690
KAREN AND GUY CAUGHT UP TO ME.

38:43.730 --> 38:45.440
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

38:45.490 --> 38:47.360
I WAS BARELY ABLE
TO HIDE THE BONDS

38:47.400 --> 38:49.950
BEFORE THE POLICE NABBED ME.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.580
THEN HORACE PICKED
THE BACK-PACK UP,

38:52.620 --> 38:53.660
AND I RENDEZVOUSED WITH HIM

38:53.700 --> 38:55.120
COURTESY OF YOUR FRIEND GUY.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.830
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A PERFECT LITTLE CRIME.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.090
OH, IT WAS DOYLE.
THANKS TO YOU.

39:04.630 --> 39:06.800
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET OFF THIS ISLAND.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.470
YEAH, THERE'S GONNA
BE A SLIGHT DELAY.

39:09.510 --> 39:12.720
MAYBE 15, 20 YEARS,

39:12.760 --> 39:16.560
POSSIBLY LESS IF YOU EXHIBIT
SIGNS OF GOOD BEHAVIOR.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.060
YOU ARSE-HOLE.

39:20.690 --> 39:22.520
HOW DID YOU FIGURE THIS OUT?

39:22.570 --> 39:25.230
WELL, IT WAS KIND OF EASY.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.650
HERE, LOOK.

39:27.700 --> 39:29.320
[JAKE] I HAD A THEORY
THAT WAS CONFIRMED

39:29.360 --> 39:31.490
THAT YOU WERE RECRUITING
HORACE AT THE BAR.

39:34.870 --> 39:37.160
THEN I NOTICED
YOU'D TAKEN A BACK-PACK

39:37.200 --> 39:38.500
FROM THE HELICOPTER HANGAR.

39:38.540 --> 39:40.250
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS IN IT.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.540
JUST GIMME THAT!

39:41.580 --> 39:42.960
[JAKE] HOWEVER
AT THE DEALERSHIP,

39:43.000 --> 39:46.010
I NOTICED YOU'D STASHED
THE BACK-PACK SOMEWHERE.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.920
THEN MY THEORY WAS REINFORCED

39:47.970 --> 39:51.300
WHEN YOU TOLD YOUR LITTLE
FOLK TALE EARLIER.

39:51.340 --> 39:52.800
YOU DIDN'T MENTION HORACE

39:52.850 --> 39:55.060
OR THE BACK-PACK BEING
AT THE DEALERSHIP.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.560
AND THEN ROSE, SHE CHECKED

39:56.600 --> 39:58.480
ALL THE EXIT ROUTES
OFF THE ISLAND.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.650
IT WAS RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSE.

40:01.690 --> 40:05.480
YOU WERE GOING TO USE
KAREN'S OWN HELICOPTER
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.230
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE EARLIER.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.700
YOU NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE
TO TAKE OFF IN THIS THING.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.570
YEAH.

40:13.620 --> 40:14.870
CARDS WELL PLAYED, SIR.

40:14.910 --> 40:16.540
&lt;POLICE SIREN&gt;

40:16.580 --> 40:18.500
BUT THIS... THIS AIN'T OVER.

40:19.210 --> 40:20.460
NOT QUITE.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.960
I... I JUST HAVE
TO GO AWAY AND...

40:24.000 --> 40:25.630
AND THINK ABOUT IT
A LITTLE BIT.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.420
HEY, BOYS. COME ON.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.180
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

40:33.720 --> 40:35.100
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

40:36.180 --> 40:37.560
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

40:37.600 --> 40:39.310
I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW,
ABOUT EARLIER.

40:39.350 --> 40:41.940
I... I SHOULD HAVE
ASKED YOU OUT PROPERLY.

40:42.650 --> 40:44.060
PROPER.

40:44.100 --> 40:46.320
I WOULD HAVE SAID NO, DES.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.480
OKAY. WELL,
YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH,

40:48.530 --> 40:51.030
'CAUSE I WAS GONNA SAY, UM,

40:51.070 --> 40:54.280
I DIDN'T ASK YOU OUT BECAUSE
I DON'T, LIKE, "LIKE" YOU.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.740
GOOD.

40:56.780 --> 40:59.540
I DON'T LIKE,
"LIKE" YOU EITHER.

41:00.330 --> 41:01.500
GOOD.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.670
GOOD.

41:07.540 --> 41:08.710
&lt;SIGH&gt;

41:11.590 --> 41:12.720
CHEERS.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.260
I EARNED THIS.

41:16.510 --> 41:18.560
OKAY, JAKE, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

41:18.600 --> 41:21.100
OH, REALLY? SERIOUSLY?
THE SILENT TREATMENT?

41:21.140 --> 41:23.390
WHAT ARE WE, TEN?

41:23.440 --> 41:25.560
OKAY, GREAT. GREAT.
STAY SILENT AFTER THIS.

41:28.770 --> 41:29.690
ENOUGH!

41:31.530 --> 41:32.780
YOU'RE NOT IN
GRADE SCHOOL ANYMORE.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.320
HASH IT OUT.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.620
&lt;BAR CHATTER&gt;

41:45.670 --> 41:47.040
YOU SLEPT WITH
MY SISTER FIRST.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.540
YEAH, BUT WHEN
YOU FOUND OUT YOU...

41:48.590 --> 41:50.550
YOU PUNCHED ME
IN THE FACE. REMEMBER?

41:57.180 --> 41:58.600
ALL RIGHT, B'Y, LOOK. FINE.

41:58.640 --> 41:59.970
OKAY? IT'S FINE.

42:01.020 --> 42:02.560
KATHLEEN'S A BIG GIRL.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.180
SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.560
GOOD.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.900
HEY.

42:06.940 --> 42:08.150
I'M GOING OUT
WITH WALTER, JAKE.

42:08.190 --> 42:09.650
SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
TOO BAD.

42:09.690 --> 42:10.940
UH, I DON'T CARE.

42:13.070 --> 42:14.780
THAT IS JUST GROSS, ALL RIGHT?

42:14.820 --> 42:16.200
-SO KNOCK IT OFF.
-[KATHLEEN] OKAY, COME ON.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.700
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.450
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

42:21.490 --> 42:23.540
YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

42:31.420 --> 42:33.630
YOU LOOK NICE.

42:34.050 --> 42:35.260
BIG NIGHT?

42:35.670 --> 42:37.010
YEAH.

42:37.050 --> 42:38.300
DINNER.

42:38.340 --> 42:41.850
OH, YEAH? YOU, UH,
YOU GOT A HOT DATE OR...

42:41.890 --> 42:43.640
DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOU CONSIDER HOT.

42:44.310 --> 42:45.430
IT'S WITH GUY.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.730
WELL, I DON'T CONSIDER
THAT HOT, ACTUALLY.

42:48.600 --> 42:49.900
I'M ONLY JOKING.

42:51.190 --> 42:54.440
THE ONLY DINNER PLANS
I HAVE IS WITH MY SISTER
WHO'S IN TOWN.

42:54.490 --> 42:56.610
AH! &lt;RELIEVED LAUGH&gt;

42:56.650 --> 42:57.780
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A SISTER.

42:57.820 --> 43:00.910
YOU, UH, YOU TWO,
ARE YOU, EH, CLOSE?

43:01.950 --> 43:04.330
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

43:04.370 --> 43:06.460
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
I THOUGHT I SENSED

43:06.500 --> 43:09.250
SOME CHEMISTRY BETWEEN
YOU AND, UH, GUY.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.170
HE'S NOT ALL THAT.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.420
&lt;SPEAKING FRENCH&gt;

43:16.470 --> 43:18.090
COME ON. YOU KNOW
I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH.

43:18.130 --> 43:19.260
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

43:32.900 --> 43:34.320
&lt;SPEAKING FRENCH&gt;

43:40.410 --> 43:41.820
