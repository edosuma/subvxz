Sorry. I'm not the type

18:06.794 --> 18:10.297
to be nibbled and tell.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.052
Kimmy, I want you to know

18:14.093 --> 18:16.804
that whatever happened

18:14.093 --> 18:16.804
between you and Nelson

18:16.846 --> 18:19.473
and I don't need details.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.559
I wish you the best.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.686
Oh, Deej, I thought

18:21.601 --> 18:23.686
you said that Nelson

18:23.728 --> 18:25.563
couldn't be interested in me.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.065
I know. I'm sorry.

18:27.147 --> 18:31.235
I-I guess the only reason

18:27.147 --> 18:31.235
I said that was...

18:31.277 --> 18:33.529
because I was jealous.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.823
You were jealous of me?

18:35.865 --> 18:37.324
Wow.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.994
My whole life,

18:37.366 --> 18:39.994
you were always up here

18:40.036 --> 18:42.622
and I was always down here.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.458
Now I'm up here,

18:42.663 --> 18:45.458
and you're down here.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.044
Cool.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.882
Kimmy, I'd like to think

18:49.796 --> 18:52.882
of it more as...here.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.052
I can live with that.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.511
Thanks, Deej.

19:00.222 --> 19:04.184
Kimmy, there's a picture on the

19:00.222 --> 19:04.184
sports page that looks like you.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.187
Oh, it couldn't be.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.187
Gotta go.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.481
Hold it.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.524
Says here,

19:08.522 --> 19:10.524
"An overexcited fan

19:10.566 --> 19:12.986
"leaned over the fence

19:10.566 --> 19:12.986
to pinch the bat boy

19:13.027 --> 19:15.571
"and took a foul ball

19:13.027 --> 19:15.571
to the neck."

19:17.323 --> 19:18.699
Kimmy!

19:18.741 --> 19:20.827
The worst part is

19:18.741 --> 19:20.827
I missed the bat boy

19:20.868 --> 19:22.870
and got a handful

19:20.868 --> 19:22.870
of Tommy Lasorda.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.165
- Bye.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.165
- See you.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.377
Michelle, why did your dad

19:27.917 --> 19:30.377
call us all here?

19:30.419 --> 19:32.922
I don't know.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.922
He's not home yet.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.091
It better be good!

19:35.133 --> 19:41.180
That's just what

19:35.133 --> 19:41.180
I was thinking.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.683
Dad, what happened

19:41.221 --> 19:43.683
to your shirt?

19:43.724 --> 19:47.020
Same thing that happened to

19:43.724 --> 19:47.020
my ribs, but you can see it.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.105
Alright, Aaron, Derek, Lisa,

19:49.147 --> 19:51.149
I got a little business

19:49.147 --> 19:51.149
proposition for you guys.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.193
We're listening.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.780
Alright. This club

19:54.234 --> 19:57.780
means a lot to Michelle.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.282
If you guys let her back in

19:57.822 --> 20:00.282
I'll give you what's in the bag.

20:00.324 --> 20:03.870
Without seeing it?

20:00.324 --> 20:03.870
You must think we're stupid.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.290
I'm afraid in his own rude way

20:08.332 --> 20:10.043
Aaron's right, sir.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.463
Okay, you guys drive

20:11.669 --> 20:14.463
a hard bargain

20:14.505 --> 20:17.424
but feast your eyes on...

20:17.466 --> 20:19.760
(together)

20:17.466 --> 20:19.760
Super Fortress!

20:21.012 --> 20:25.224
- Whoa. Whoa.

20:21.012 --> 20:25.224
- Look. Whoa. Wow.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.769
Super fake!

20:28.811 --> 20:31.981
Yeah, this is not

20:28.811 --> 20:31.981
an official Super Fortress.

20:32.023 --> 20:36.027
Super Mandy

20:32.023 --> 20:36.027
looks like Abraham Lincoln.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.904
And I believe the evil Fungo

20:37.945 --> 20:40.990
bears a striking resemblance

20:37.945 --> 20:40.990
to Herbert Hoover.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.785
This is just

20:42.533 --> 20:44.785
a cheap imitation.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.704
Cheap?

20:46.746 --> 20:50.541
I paid 75 bucks to a guy in

20:46.746 --> 20:50.541
an alley for this stuff.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.960
$75? Ha!

20:53.002 --> 20:54.628
They saw you coming.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.090
[laughing]

20:58.007 --> 20:59.800
Stop it!

20:58.007 --> 20:59.800
It's not funny!

20:59.842 --> 21:01.510
It's okay, honey.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.510
It's okay.

21:01.552 --> 21:05.264
No. You tried harder

21:01.552 --> 21:05.264
than anyone to help me.

21:05.305 --> 21:08.101
Your shirt got all ripped

21:05.305 --> 21:08.101
and you got all dirty.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.561
I think you're the best dad

21:08.142 --> 21:10.561
in the whole world.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.147
Aw, thank you.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.984
That's real sweet, but you're

21:13.189 --> 21:16.984
still out of the club!

21:18.111 --> 21:19.862
Who cares about

21:18.111 --> 21:19.862
your stupid club?

21:19.904 --> 21:22.782
I'll start my own club and none

21:19.904 --> 21:22.782
of you guys can be in it.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.825
Oh, wait a minute.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.825
That's not right.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.493
The whole reason to be in a club

21:26.535 --> 21:29.288
in the first place is to hang

21:26.535 --> 21:29.288
out with your friends have fun.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.457
But if you're gonna fight all

21:29.329 --> 21:31.457
the time, what fun is that?

21:31.498 --> 21:34.877
What fun is having a secret

21:31.498 --> 21:34.877
if somebody blabs it?

21:36.212 --> 21:39.257
Our young mutant friend here

21:36.212 --> 21:39.257
makes a good point.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.967
Okay, perhaps it was a mistake

21:41.008 --> 21:43.552
for Michelle to tell me

21:41.008 --> 21:43.552
about your secret club.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.805
Big mistake.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.975
And it was a mistake

21:45.846 --> 21:48.975
for me to blab it to you guys.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.144
Bigger mistake.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.436
And it was a mistake for me

21:52.478 --> 21:54.814
to try and bribe her way

21:52.478 --> 21:54.814
back into the club.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.191
We're all in agreement

21:54.855 --> 21:57.191
that mistakes were made here

21:57.233 --> 21:59.026
but that doesn't mean

21:57.233 --> 21:59.026
you guys can't be friends.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.694
You still like each other,

21:59.068 --> 22:00.694
don't you?

22:01.862 --> 22:03.990
I still like Michelle.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.283
Me too.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.663
Yeah. I like her, too.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.623
I like you guys, too.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.459
I think Michelle

22:12.665 --> 22:15.459
should be reinstated.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.211
Why don't we just

22:15.501 --> 22:17.211
let her back in?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.131
Right.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.258
[instrumental music]

22:26.053 --> 22:27.554
Ready?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.347

22:27.596 --> 22:29.347
- Mutant..

22:29.389 --> 22:31.349
- Super..

22:29.389 --> 22:31.349
- Kids!

22:31.391 --> 22:32.685
And their dads.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.605
Dad, don't push it.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.067
Right.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.067
Well, you guys have fun.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.443
I'm going to start

22:40.109 --> 22:41.443
my own club.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.863
The mighty mutant

22:41.485 --> 22:43.863

22:46.991 --> 22:48.534

22:46.991 --> 22:48.534
