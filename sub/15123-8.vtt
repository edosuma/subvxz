WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:03.804
Hello?

00:03.871 --> 00:05.139
Anyone home?

00:05.206 --> 00:07.441
Your mat says "Welcome"...

00:08.409 --> 00:10.278
unless it's being sarcastic.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.646
If that's the case,
it should have quotes around it.

00:13.881 --> 00:14.948
Is this
really necessary?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.884
(doorbell rings)
Trust me, ever since
his wife left him,

00:16.950 --> 00:18.952
he comes over
and he won't leave.
(knocking)

00:19.019 --> 00:22.590
Hello? Hello? Hello?

00:22.656 --> 00:23.891
We never should have

00:23.957 --> 00:25.693
let this guy in
the first time.
(toilet flushes)

00:25.759 --> 00:27.661
It's like when we fed
that three-legged dog

00:27.728 --> 00:28.829
with the filmy eye,

00:28.896 --> 00:29.997
and it kept
coming around.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.232
Doesn't anybody hear the...?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.401
Oh, man.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.138
You guys are jerks.

00:38.972 --> 00:39.973
(sighs)

00:40.040 --> 00:42.042
I got some mail
for Donna today.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.344
(sighs)
It was addressed to "occupants,"

00:43.411 --> 00:44.945
but she would have loved

00:45.012 --> 00:47.515
(voice breaks)
to get half-price
carpet cleaning.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.950
It's okay.
(sobbing)

00:50.017 --> 00:51.219
There, there.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.790
Is he gone?

00:58.592 --> 01:00.161
* Whoo! *

01:00.228 --> 01:02.963
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh *

01:03.030 --> 01:04.532
* Oh, oh, oh! *

01:05.966 --> 01:07.701
(tuning radio)

01:07.768 --> 01:10.271
* *

01:19.046 --> 01:20.448
(yelps)

01:20.514 --> 01:22.150
What time did Andrew
finally leave?

01:22.216 --> 01:25.052
I don't know.
I fell asleep.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.355
I hope I didn't
hurt his feelings.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.457
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Do you want to be rich?
Yes.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.526
Do you want to provide a secure
future for your children?
Yes.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.095
Would you like to tell your boss
to take this job and shove it?

01:35.163 --> 01:36.697
Oh, God, yes.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.333
Then all you need is the next
great American invention.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.135
Damn it,
there's always a catch!

01:41.202 --> 01:42.603
Bring your ideas down

01:42.670 --> 01:44.405
to the National Invention
Convention Extravaganza

01:44.472 --> 01:46.940
at the Natesville High School
gym this Saturday,

01:47.007 --> 01:49.042
where a celebrity judge
could make you

01:49.109 --> 01:51.179
America's next millionaire.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.480
We could never
win that.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.681
Why not?

01:53.747 --> 01:56.750
Regular people come up
with great inventions every day.

01:56.817 --> 02:01.789
What if we combine the oven
with the toaster into one thing?

02:01.855 --> 02:03.957
An oven-toaster.

02:04.024 --> 02:04.792
Inventing's for smart people.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.560
Like the guy
who put his chocolate

02:06.627 --> 02:07.995
in the other guy's
peanut butter.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.263
That's not true.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.064
Bill Gates couldn't
even finish college,

02:11.131 --> 02:12.500
and he invented the computer.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.268
Do you really think
we could do this?

02:14.335 --> 02:16.103
We gotta at least try. Guys,

02:16.170 --> 02:18.472
this could be our one chance
at having a better life.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.707
Maybe you're right.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.141
I think we
could invent something.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.210
(sighs)

02:22.276 --> 02:23.577
I'm in.
Great.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.978
Everybody put on
your thinking caps today

02:25.045 --> 02:27.348
and come home with at least
one good invention.

02:27.415 --> 02:31.084
What about putting hot food
into pockets?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.120
Pocket-Hots.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.488
(blows)

02:38.226 --> 02:40.194
Well, cleanup
on aisle three is done.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.295
Happy to say mother

02:41.362 --> 02:42.830
and new child
are doing just fine.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.064
What ya drawing?

02:44.131 --> 02:45.833
Just my idea
for a new invention.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.167
It's a baby mop.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.770
While the baby crawls,
it also cleans.

02:49.837 --> 02:50.704
My mom wants us to enter

02:50.771 --> 02:51.805
the National Invention
Convention Extravaganza

02:51.872 --> 02:52.940
this Saturday.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.209
I've always considered myself
pretty inventive.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.277
I invented a language

02:56.344 --> 02:58.879
that only me and my
identical twin knew.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.014
But I haven't spoken
to that ugly turd in decades,

03:01.081 --> 03:02.383
so maybe I should invent
something new.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.886
That'll really fisnad
his gleeblok.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.656
Have you thought about making
those in different colors?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.258
I'm gonna do that
with my invention.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.059
Different colors.
I call that.

03:12.125 --> 03:12.926
What's your invention?

03:14.161 --> 03:15.296
I don't know,

03:15.363 --> 03:16.797
but it's gonna be
different colors.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.767
Different colors,
that's a great idea.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.702
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna do it. Thanks.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.003
Really?
Uh-huh.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.372
Wow. That's really cool.

03:24.438 --> 03:27.174
What?
Oh, that you're gonna
take my idea.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.443
Wyatt's always working on
projects for business school,

03:29.510 --> 03:30.944
and every time I try
to make a suggestion,

03:31.011 --> 03:33.847
he just shoots it down like he's
threatened by it or something.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.750
Threatened? That's crazy.
That-that's a weird thing to be.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.218
Not me.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.354
In fact, do you
want to partner up on this?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.922
I mean, we'll have
to spend a lot of time

03:41.989 --> 03:43.056
together working on it...

03:43.123 --> 03:44.825
Sure. Yeah, that sounds fun.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.332
You got your pen
in my cottage cheese!

03:51.399 --> 03:53.301
You got your cottage
cheese on my pen.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.209
(spits)

04:02.276 --> 04:04.612
Nope. Keep thinking.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.656
I know I shouldn't keep shaving
with Donna's leg razor,

04:15.723 --> 04:18.459
but I miss her, and it
makes me feel close to her.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.364
Burt, did you fall asleep
on me again?

04:23.431 --> 04:25.433
I'm sorry.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.200
There's some inventors
contest this weekend,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.503
and Virginia wants us
to "put on our thinking caps"

04:29.570 --> 04:30.971
and think of an invention.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.806
Come up with anything yet?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.942
Uh, solar-powered
electric jump rope,

04:35.008 --> 04:37.378
a pencil that makes
your grammar more correcter,

04:37.445 --> 04:38.812
man yogurt.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.581
Man yogurt?

04:40.648 --> 04:41.815
You know, yogurt for men.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.984
All they have now
are girly flavors like

04:44.051 --> 04:45.953
blueberry or strawberry.

04:46.019 --> 04:50.057
Why not man flavors
like pork chops, stew?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.425
Interesting.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.026
You could call it "Bro-gurt."

04:54.428 --> 04:56.029
Bro-gurt!

04:58.432 --> 05:01.101
I got it! I got it!

05:01.168 --> 05:02.336
I got our million-
dollar idea.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.472
Man-flavored yogurt.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.474
Why in the world
would anyone want yogurt

05:06.540 --> 05:08.208
that tastes like a man?

05:08.275 --> 05:11.111
No, it's man flavors,
like hamburger,

05:11.178 --> 05:14.114
cheeseburger, but not turkey
burger 'cause that'd be girly.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.549
You see
how this works?

05:15.616 --> 05:17.150
And here's the best part.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.086
We call it "Bro-gurt."

05:20.754 --> 05:22.890
Bro-gurt.

05:22.956 --> 05:23.824
I like it.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.593
A catchy name
is half the battle.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.928
That's right up there
with Manwich.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.263
See, it's that type of thinking
that's gonna get us

05:30.330 --> 05:31.632
out of the service business

05:31.699 --> 05:33.934
And into the business
of being served!

05:34.001 --> 05:36.236
God, you are on a roll!

05:36.303 --> 05:38.639
(chuckles)
On a roll like a Manwich!

05:38.706 --> 05:39.773
Whoa!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.375
I've got to tell
that Manwich line

05:41.442 --> 05:42.776
to Andrew when he comes over.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.245
Andrew? No, that twit
cannot come over here.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.714
We got work to do.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.116
He's my partner. He came up
with the name "Bro-gurt."

05:49.182 --> 05:50.751
Burt...

05:50.818 --> 05:52.853
this was for our family
to get ahead.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.724
Now Andrew is gonna be an
albacore around our necks

05:56.790 --> 05:58.626
for the rest of our lives!

05:58.692 --> 06:00.994
I think I've got
a good one.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.396
"The Baby Mop."

06:02.463 --> 06:03.831
Put it on a baby...

06:03.897 --> 06:07.267
And the baby crawls
your mess away. I like it.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.169
It's smart,
it's simple,

06:09.236 --> 06:11.705
and most importantly,
no outside partner.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.740
I have a partner.
Sabrina.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.642
No! The plan was to go out

06:14.708 --> 06:16.444
and come back with an idea!

06:16.510 --> 06:18.011
Not come back
with a person

06:18.078 --> 06:20.848
that we have to share our
bajillion dollars with. Dang!

06:20.914 --> 06:23.283
Am I the only smart person
in this house?

06:23.350 --> 06:26.454
What about a TV channel
just for news?

06:26.520 --> 06:29.256
Wait. They'll have to fill up

06:29.322 --> 06:32.292
too many hours and resort
to sensationalizing non-issues

06:32.359 --> 06:34.361
and stirring up
partisan bickering.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.730
Scratch that idea. It sucks.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.131
Oh...

06:42.470 --> 06:43.471
Hello.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.038
Hey, good news.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.874
Since Hope
doesn't crawl anymore,

06:46.940 --> 06:48.709
Shelley's gonna loan us some
babies for the presentation.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.479
That's great,
but I have good news, too.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.047
I finally figured out what's
missing from the Baby Mop.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.750
The handle to steer it.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.851
Yeah, but the
baby's just

06:57.918 --> 06:59.753
supposed to clean
while it crawls around.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.121
That's the whole point.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.456
But babies are unpredictable,

07:02.523 --> 07:04.091
and they might not crawl

07:04.157 --> 07:05.325
where you want them to,

07:05.392 --> 07:07.294
and... (sighs)
Man, you hate it!

07:07.360 --> 07:10.297
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just letting it soak in.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.466
Uh, a stick.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.468
Yeah, because, just...

07:14.535 --> 07:16.203
Yeah, no, a stick!

07:16.269 --> 07:18.706
It's a great idea, partner.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.574
Thanks.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.776
I'm gonna go see
if we have more colors.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.348
Dude, she just jacked up
your invention

07:28.415 --> 07:29.617
with that handle.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.152
Now it's just a mop
that cries.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.454
Yeah, but this invention thing's
a long shot anyway.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.956
I'm not gonna argue with her.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.291
That's what Wyatt does,
and I'm gonna do the opposite.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.560
The opposite
of the guy

07:39.627 --> 07:41.962
she has sex with.
Good strategy.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.965
Anyway, doesn't matter because
your baby mop has no chance

07:45.032 --> 07:47.768
of winning
against my "shoemerang."

07:47.835 --> 07:50.237
A shoe that will return
to you no matter

07:50.303 --> 07:51.805
where you throw it.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.810
(shoe clatters in distance)

08:00.681 --> 08:02.382
I'm still working on ideas.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.552
(blender whirring)

08:12.159 --> 08:13.260
Mmm.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.327
That has to be the best

08:14.394 --> 08:16.664
scotch-and-cigar-flavored
yogurt ever made!

08:16.730 --> 08:18.365
I know, right?

08:18.431 --> 08:19.833
Bro-gurt is just
the beginning.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.068
If this goes well,
we can invent

08:21.134 --> 08:22.703
all sorts of products
just for men.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.838
Yeah. Why should women
get to invent everything?

08:24.905 --> 08:25.739
Exactly.

08:25.806 --> 08:26.907
We can make pork-sicles.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.609
We can make soap
that smells like bacon.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.043
Tampons for our butts!

08:30.110 --> 08:31.078
What?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.580
I don't know.
I-I'm just pitching.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.014
You losers can quit
chopping meat.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.883
I've got
the winning invention.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.285
What does the average
American family

08:38.351 --> 08:41.622
spend $130 a year on?

08:41.689 --> 08:42.956
Deodorant.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.659
But that'll all stop
once they buy...

08:45.726 --> 08:47.394
Pit-stops!

08:47.460 --> 08:50.731
The world's first reusable
underarm protection.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.902
Ooh, that's good.
(sighs)

08:57.004 --> 08:58.238
If this goes well, you're
gonna grow up wearing

08:58.305 --> 09:00.908
name-brand clothes
and get braces.
(cooing)

09:00.974 --> 09:03.644
How ya doing,
Natesville inventors?

09:03.711 --> 09:05.212
(gasps)
Sorry I couldn't be there

09:05.278 --> 09:06.213
with you in person,

09:06.279 --> 09:08.882
but I got a lot
of Hollywood projects,

09:08.949 --> 09:11.218
and these jackets don't cut
the sleeves off themselves.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.653
Still got it.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.154
But I'm still able
to be there with you

09:14.221 --> 09:16.690
because of the technology
of the video chat,

09:16.757 --> 09:19.727
which somebody invented.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.434
You've come in here today
as regular, average citizens,

09:27.500 --> 09:30.237
but one of you may leave here
as wealthy as me.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.639
So good luck to you.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.107
Registration starts
in five minutes.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.577
Please follow the yellow carpet
to the sign-up tables outside.

09:37.645 --> 09:38.812
See ya then.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.050
Andrew Dice Clay, oh, my God!

09:43.116 --> 09:44.484
I love him!

09:44.551 --> 09:47.655
His cassette's been
stuck in my car radio,
like, ten years.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.589
(spits, squawks)

10:02.569 --> 10:05.572
Okay, the basic
entry fee is $20.

10:05.639 --> 10:09.009
For a little bit extra, we offer
patent-pending date-stamping.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.044
This stops other people
from stealing your idea.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.013
It's too bad this wasn't around

10:13.080 --> 10:14.948
when Bill Johnson
invented the lightbulb.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.417
I thought Thomas Edison
invented the lightbulb.

10:17.484 --> 10:20.020
And that's why you
need the date stamp.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.655
I'll take it.
You think
we should get that?

10:21.722 --> 10:24.792
Burt, I didn't know we had
to pitch this to a celebrity.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.293
I don't think I can do this.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.228
Okay, fine.
I'll do all the talking.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.462
You got to settle down.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.932
Now, uh, go over
to the glow-in-the-dark
ice-cream guy.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.200
Maybe he's got a napkin

10:33.266 --> 10:34.702
(hushed)
you can dry
your eyes with.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.603
Okay, now I hate to be pushy,

10:36.670 --> 10:38.706
but I cannot recommend
any higher

10:38.772 --> 10:40.240
the invention checklist.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.775
I mean, the first thing

10:41.842 --> 10:43.476
on the list is "Buy the
invention checklist."

10:43.543 --> 10:44.577
I'll take it.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.346
Hey, good idea
sending him over there.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.348
Now let's win this thing
before he gets back.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.618
What has happened to you?
You sound so heartless.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.187
I am heartless where a billion
dollars is concerned.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.357
Burt, people only
give to charity
after they have money.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.492
You think Oprah was building
orphanages in Africa

10:59.559 --> 11:01.328
when she was poor? She wasn't.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.863
She was smoking crack
in Baltimore.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.932
Why do you hate Oprah so much?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.266
Why do you always defend her?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.969
Okay...

11:09.036 --> 11:11.905
your total comes to $87.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.374
We are going to be so rich.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.946
Knock, knock.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.715
I like where this is going.
Who's there?

11:21.782 --> 11:22.783
Orange.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.284
Orange who?

11:24.351 --> 11:27.921
Orange you glad someone invented
a new color of traffic cone?

11:29.356 --> 11:32.259
The formal traffic cone
for black-tie events.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.863
Hey, hammerhead, black-tie
events are at night.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.398
Drivers can't see those cones.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.466
What's wrong with you?

11:43.670 --> 11:45.806
Shoemerang!

11:45.873 --> 11:47.507
(glass shatters)
(crowd gasps)

11:47.574 --> 11:49.209
Next.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.911
If there's two things
I love in this world,

11:50.978 --> 11:52.846
it's produce and skin care.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.614
And this is where
my two loves meet.

11:54.681 --> 11:57.617
An avocado face mask which
you keep on for 15 minutes,

11:57.684 --> 11:59.887
and then...

12:00.821 --> 12:02.322
Mmm...

12:02.389 --> 12:04.524
Mmm. Eat the years
off your face

12:04.591 --> 12:06.894
with Face-amole.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.829
All right, face cream
you could eat.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.164
I've eaten worse things
than that. Oh!

12:11.231 --> 12:13.200
(laughs)
Let's talk numbers.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.302
How much dough does each jar
cost to make?

12:15.368 --> 12:17.905
Oh, uh, avocados are 30 cents
apiece wholesale.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.940
Two avocados per jar,
40 cents for the jar.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.508
So each unit costs one dollar.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.277
Man, I didn't know he was going
to ask us how much stuff costs.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.279
I can't do math
in my head.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.448
Here's some paper.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.649
I can't do math on paper.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.385
I'm going to run home and get
our receipts and a calculator.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.420
Hey, grab me some perfume.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.588
These Pit-stops are good
at absorbing sweat,

12:35.655 --> 12:37.490
but they're doing
nothing for the stink.
(sniffs)

12:39.692 --> 12:42.429
Hey, Jimmy,
here's your babies.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.931
I hope we go early.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.834
I'm technically not
supposed to take them
away from the day care center.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.969
Hey, where's the handle?

12:49.036 --> 12:51.704
Oh, man.
I bet the janitor stole it.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.206
He was probably afraid

12:53.273 --> 12:54.842
the babies were going
to take his job.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.309
Oh, but not with the stick.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.511
No, he'd still have
to push the stick.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.546
(sighs)
I'll go talk to him.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.849
Yeah, and there are 12 other
janitors that work here,

13:01.915 --> 13:03.616
so if the first one
doesn't know what
you're talking about,

13:03.683 --> 13:05.418
just keep looking.
DICE: Next.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.154
SHELLEY:
* If you've got some milk
that you dropped *

13:07.220 --> 13:09.522
* Clean-up's a breeze
with the Baby Mop. *

13:09.589 --> 13:12.225
If there are two things in life
you can always count on,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.862
it's that things will spill...

13:16.696 --> 13:18.265
...and babies will crawl.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.235
(Dice cooing)

13:22.302 --> 13:24.504
Not only is there no reason
to cry over spilled milk,

13:24.571 --> 13:27.407
there's no reason to cry
over spilled wine.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.376
* If your husband's a drunk
and he just won't stop *

13:29.442 --> 13:31.644
* You're the kind of mom
that needs a Baby Mop *

13:31.711 --> 13:34.514
* Baby Mop turns a baby
into a cleaning machine *

13:34.581 --> 13:36.984
* If she's got the time
to crawl *

13:37.050 --> 13:38.952
* Then she's got the time
to clean. *

13:39.019 --> 13:42.255
Hey, I went to the store,
and I got a new mop handle.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.824
We've already started
the presentation.
That's okay. Just start over.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.093
Here you go.
Just go ahead.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.228
Nope, no, enough
with the stupid stick.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.331
What? You told me
that you liked it.
I lied.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.333
And now it's just
a mop that cries.
Oh, really?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.668
Well, why don't we ask
Andrew Dice Clay what he thinks.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.370
Do you think
the handle is stupid?

13:57.437 --> 14:00.007
Of course it's stupid, but don't
worry about it, sweetheart.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.609
You're pretty. Nobody
expects you to be smart.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.611
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't want this stick

14:04.677 --> 14:06.679
to cost me and Hope a shot
at a billion dollars.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.415
So you patronize me?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.583
What does that word mean?
It means you're
acting like a jerk.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.320
I think you're confusing
being a jerk with being right.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.422
Oh!
Well, if you're not going
to use the mop handle,

14:15.488 --> 14:17.590
Then I got a pretty good idea
where you can shove it.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.394
* Baby Mop. *

14:21.461 --> 14:22.695
(strumming ukulele)

14:22.762 --> 14:24.597
BURT:
Receipts and calculator!

14:24.664 --> 14:26.499
Got it, got it, got it!

14:26.566 --> 14:31.204
Got it. I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it, I got it.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.875
Stupid, stupid...
(phone ringing)

14:35.943 --> 14:38.678
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

14:38.745 --> 14:40.047
(line ringing)

14:40.113 --> 14:41.448
You're right,
the reception is great,

14:41.514 --> 14:44.918
but my partner's not
answering. (groans)

14:44.985 --> 14:46.653
Oh, do you have a
really bad headache?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.858
My underarms are bone dry.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.061
That's because I'm wearing...

14:55.828 --> 14:57.330
Pit-stops!

14:57.397 --> 14:59.699
Stopping your day
from being the pits.

14:59.766 --> 15:03.170
So if I have two rubber bands
and two sponges in my house,

15:03.236 --> 15:06.406
and I do, why would
I buy your product?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.578
They come in children's
sizes, too.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.381
Next. That brings us to...

15:14.447 --> 15:15.482
Bro-gurt.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.651
Would the inventors
of Bro-gurt get up here?

15:18.718 --> 15:19.786
Bro-gurt?

15:19.852 --> 15:21.688
All right, then, moving on.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.557
For the fifth time, I'd like
to call up the inventor

15:24.624 --> 15:28.661
of the total-noise-
cancellation headphones.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.097
(sighs)

15:30.163 --> 15:33.000
The total-noise-cancellation
headphones.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.277
Excuse me, sir.
I was wondering

15:44.344 --> 15:46.113
if I could pitch
to Mr. Clay now.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.248
I'm-I'm sorry. All the
presentations are done.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.884
The Dice Man is making
his decision as we speak.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.586
I am such a loser.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.656
I was too afraid to step up
for my friend Burt,

15:56.723 --> 16:00.027
and now the world will never
get to taste his man yogurt.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.965
(sighs)

16:06.033 --> 16:07.334
(inaudible)

16:15.775 --> 16:17.344
There, there.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.982
What happened?
Am I too late?

16:23.050 --> 16:24.817
I'm sorry, Burt.
I wanted to go up

16:24.884 --> 16:27.787
when they kept calling our name,
but every time I stood up,

16:27.854 --> 16:30.357
I started to poop a little
and had to sit back down.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.025
And we should have made
those butt tampons.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.493
It's not your fault.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.029
If I had half a brain, I would
have known to come prepared.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.797
I'm just glad I get
to take these off.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.100
I'm starting to lose
feeling in my arms.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.438
Attention, everyone.
Listen to me over here.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.440
In a way, you're all winners,

16:47.507 --> 16:49.409
'cause you got to spend
the day with the Dice Man.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.144
But that's the only way,

16:51.211 --> 16:53.313
because I didn't hear
anything today

16:53.380 --> 16:56.116
that was worthy
of my celebrity to endorse.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.684
So, there is no winner.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.652
So I guess you could say,
(crowd groaning)

16:59.719 --> 17:01.221
you rolled the craps

17:01.288 --> 17:02.889
with the Dice Man.

17:02.955 --> 17:06.226
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Dice Clay.

17:06.293 --> 17:09.996
Uh, my partner never
got a chance to pitch his idea.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.331
DICE: You're
out of luck, pal.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.032
Hickory dickory dock,

17:13.100 --> 17:15.034
you ran out of time
on the clock.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.303
Oh!

17:16.369 --> 17:17.870
I know, but he-he was gone,

17:17.937 --> 17:21.141
and I-I was just too intimidated
to-to step in for him.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.942
And anyway, he's back now...

17:23.009 --> 17:24.311
Hey, ding dong,

17:24.377 --> 17:26.179
what part of "no"
don't you understand?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.348
You want me to say it
in different languages?

17:28.415 --> 17:31.551
Spanish-- "no."
French-- "no."

17:31.618 --> 17:33.320
Portuguese-- "no."

17:33.386 --> 17:35.088
No! No!

17:35.155 --> 17:36.456
I'm tired of giving up.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.859
I didn't get into the college
I wanted and so I gave up.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.028
My wife left me
and I gave up.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.763
Well, I can't
do it this time,

17:43.830 --> 17:47.167
because this time I
didn't just mess up my own life!

17:47.234 --> 17:49.136
This was my friend's
chance to get ahead!

17:49.202 --> 17:50.470
My only friend.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.139
And it's a great idea.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.307
And we are not leaving
until you hear about it

17:54.374 --> 17:56.343
and hopefully validate
our parking.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.911
Who do you think
you're talking to, huh?

17:58.978 --> 18:00.780
I'm the Dice Man.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.283
I got my name on my shirt.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.552
There ain't a dry cleaner
in Brooklyn

18:05.618 --> 18:07.920
don't got my picture
on their wall.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.156
Get out of here.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.823
You got that, pal?

18:10.890 --> 18:13.260
You understand me now, huh?

18:13.326 --> 18:16.163
So let's get stepping
towards the door.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.265
(gasps)
Oh!

18:18.331 --> 18:21.468
Pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.504
VIRGINIA:
This is a scam.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.740
Andrew Dice Clay didn't
turn us down, you did.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.942
You are a very bad man.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.778
Yeah. I bet you don't
even know anything

18:31.844 --> 18:33.446
about inventing products.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.348
That's not true.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.083
I mean, I invented this--

18:37.150 --> 18:39.219
this digital video

18:39.286 --> 18:40.887
motion-capture technology.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.822
But I didn't know anything
about patent law,

18:42.889 --> 18:45.492
and it turns out James Cameron
had invented it first.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.093
That kid from Growing Pains?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.329
I always thought
he was smart.

18:49.396 --> 18:52.565
The point I'm
trying to make is that

18:52.632 --> 18:54.133
I thought
I'd wasted

18:54.201 --> 18:55.768
a lot of time
and money on this,

18:55.835 --> 18:59.572
and then I found an innovative
way to make money with it.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.274
Yeah, by scamming us
out of our savings

19:01.341 --> 19:02.642
and giving us
nothing in return.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.010
No, no, listen,
listen, easy, easy.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.912
Okay, Burt?

19:05.978 --> 19:09.182
Burt, okay, I wouldn't say you
didn't get anything out of this.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.384
I mean, I heard Andrew
say that you thought

19:11.451 --> 19:12.885
you weren't smart.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.387
I mean, you came up

19:14.454 --> 19:16.556
with the idea for...

19:16.623 --> 19:19.592
It's yogurt that comes
in flavors for men.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.528
That is a truly original idea.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.764
Do you know what
it takes to come up
with an original idea?

19:25.865 --> 19:26.899
Uh...

19:26.966 --> 19:28.701
It takes a brain.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.903
Yeah.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.373
I guess it does.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.343
Virginia, after Burt
comforted Andrew,

19:36.409 --> 19:38.478
I heard Burt tell you
that you had no heart.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.946
And you agreed with him?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.481
But then later,

19:41.548 --> 19:44.517
when Andrew needed comforting
and Burt wasn't around,

19:44.584 --> 19:47.920
you opened your arms
and you opened your heart.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.590
Yeah, I do have a heart.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.525
It's just that
Burt's is so big,

19:52.592 --> 19:54.594
I never have a chance
to use mine.

19:54.661 --> 19:58.197
And Andrew, you told Burt

19:58.265 --> 20:01.734
that you were too afraid to
even talk to Andrew Dice Clay.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.871
And yet later, you
summoned the courage

20:04.937 --> 20:07.106
to not only talk
to Andrew Dice Clay,

20:07.173 --> 20:08.741
you yelled
at Andrew Dice Clay.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.278
It wasn't Andrew Dice Clay,
it was you.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.946
But you didn't know that.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.417
JIMMY:
Is anybody else creeped out

20:17.484 --> 20:19.952
by how many conversations
this guy eavesdrops on?

20:20.019 --> 20:21.488
Hey, what-what about Jimmy?

20:21.554 --> 20:24.391
Yeah. What did Jimmy
get out of this?
I'll tell you what I got.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.259
I got in a huge fight
with Sabrina.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.494
Now I just want to go home.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.629
And you can go home.

20:29.696 --> 20:33.566
All of you could have gone
home any time you wanted.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.069
MAW MAW:
My ice cream!

20:37.136 --> 20:39.806
It's melting!

20:39.872 --> 20:42.241
It's melting!

20:45.011 --> 20:47.980
Are you still mad at Jimmy
about what happened today?

20:48.047 --> 20:49.449
No.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.084
Actually, the more
I think about it,

20:52.151 --> 20:55.254
I kind of really liked seeing
him blow up like that.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.157
I know. It really was kind of...
Hot, right?

20:58.224 --> 21:01.027
You know, I'm kind of glad I got
in that fight with Sabrina.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.529
I had her on such a pedestal.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.131
I'm glad you're
finally over her.
Oh, no, I still like her.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.667
But seeing how
crazy she got

21:07.734 --> 21:09.402
kind of humanized her a bit.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.338
Which is good.
Takes her down a few pegs.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.205
Hey, that Wizard of Oz
movie's coming on.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.407
Should we try
watching it again?

21:14.474 --> 21:16.242
See if we can get past
the first ten minutes?

21:16.309 --> 21:18.345
I just don't see the point
of buying a color TV

21:18.411 --> 21:19.946
to watch
a black-and-white movie.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.815
Plus Hope only
likes movies with singing
and dancing and monkeys.

21:22.882 --> 21:23.983
She'd hate it.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.251
It doesn't matter.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.252
I'll find something else.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.754
I'm just happy to be home.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.723
There's no place like home.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.494
Baby: Adorkable.
