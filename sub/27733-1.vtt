01:23.542 --> 01:24.626
- Fuck!

01:55.375 --> 01:56.667
Hmm, watch it!

01:57.417 --> 01:58.584
[Allie moaning] Oh!

02:06.959 --> 02:09.626
[Mary] How many times

02:06.959 --> 02:09.626
do I have to tell you this, Mom?

02:09.667 --> 02:10.959
I'll call you!

02:12.292 --> 02:13.375
Allie?

02:24.292 --> 02:25.459
Allie, is that you?

02:25.500 --> 02:26.417
[Allie] Yeah...

02:31.459 --> 02:33.000
Okay, so just so you know,

02:33.042 --> 02:35.834
I really, really have to...

02:38.209 --> 02:39.500
[Pam] poo.

02:41.667 --> 02:42.792
- Bye.

02:43.626 --> 02:45.292
Thank you so much for dinner.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.042
I hope Allie's doing okay?

02:56.334 --> 02:58.876
[Allie]

02:56.334 --> 02:58.876
Ah, you were at dinner

02:56.334 --> 02:58.876
for like three hours.

02:58.918 --> 03:00.918
And where the fuck were you?

02:58.918 --> 03:00.918
I had to tell my parents

03:00.959 --> 03:02.167
you were on your period.

03:02.209 --> 03:03.918
Ugg! Gross!

03:04.751 --> 03:05.792
I overslept.

03:06.542 --> 03:08.417
I just laid down

03:06.542 --> 03:08.417
for a little nappy nap,

03:08.459 --> 03:09.709
and then...

03:09.959 --> 03:11.751
I couldn't get my ass

03:09.959 --> 03:11.751
out of bed.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.584
And then you clearly

03:11.792 --> 03:13.584
didn't get ready once you did?

03:13.626 --> 03:15.834
Well, you know,

03:13.626 --> 03:15.834
I can't get ready without you.

03:15.876 --> 03:17.125
[soft laugh]

03:17.417 --> 03:19.959
So can we... go get ready now?

03:20.918 --> 03:23.042
-I'm ready!

03:20.918 --> 03:23.042
-Oh I'm sorry,

03:23.083 --> 03:25.918
my name's Kort, and I'm so cute.

03:25.959 --> 03:27.918
I don't even need

03:25.959 --> 03:27.918
to get dressed up to get hit on.

03:27.959 --> 03:30.292
Let's have a parade.

03:31.292 --> 03:32.792
Bitch!

03:32.834 --> 03:34.292
Thanks,

03:32.834 --> 03:34.292
that's really sweet of you!

03:34.334 --> 03:35.667
Whatever. I'm going to go

03:34.334 --> 03:35.667
get started.

03:35.709 --> 03:36.876
I might even shave my pussy.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.667
Oh, put my name

03:37.417 --> 03:39.667
on those left overs

03:39.709 --> 03:42.125
because I don't want these sluts

03:39.709 --> 03:42.125
eating our shit

03:39.709 --> 03:42.125
when we're not here.

03:42.167 --> 03:44.250
Why your name? I can be mean.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.709
Just put my name on it.

03:45.751 --> 03:47.250
These girls know

03:45.751 --> 03:47.250
I don't play games.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.125
[Kort] Oh, you mean

03:47.542 --> 03:49.125
you're a bitch?

03:49.959 --> 03:53.792
Oh, okay!

03:49.959 --> 03:53.792
Well, that was kind of... mean!

03:54.459 --> 03:55.417
Thanks.

03:55.459 --> 03:56.792
[fast paced music]

03:56.834 --> 03:58.209
[water running]

04:04.626 --> 04:05.876
[Allie] So...

04:06.542 --> 04:08.542
I'm thinking this is the year

04:06.542 --> 04:08.542
I get a boyfriend,

04:08.584 --> 04:11.209
You know, I'm sick of blacking

04:08.584 --> 04:11.209
out fucking frat guys,

04:11.250 --> 04:13.375
It's like, I just want

04:11.250 --> 04:13.375
to settle down, you know?

04:13.667 --> 04:15.334
I mean, last year I had

04:13.667 --> 04:15.334
my slutty sophomore stand,

04:15.375 --> 04:16.834
which was fine.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.416
I'm not going to judge

04:16.875 --> 04:18.416
myself for that.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.709
I mean,

04:18.459 --> 04:19.709
we all go through our phases.

04:19.750 --> 04:20.875
Except for you!

04:21.875 --> 04:24.584
But... Whatever,

04:21.875 --> 04:24.584
I just feel like...

04:25.083 --> 04:27.417
This is my year... you know?

04:28.667 --> 04:30.751
Until we go abroad, that is.

04:31.042 --> 04:33.375
Well, I don't think

04:31.042 --> 04:33.375
you can really plan

04:31.042 --> 04:33.375
for that sort of thing.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.125
Whatever, dude. I'll...

04:35.167 --> 04:36.751
have some flings with some Brits

04:35.167 --> 04:36.751
while we're there,

04:36.792 --> 04:38.000
and then when I get back...

04:39.792 --> 04:41.709
We'll date!

04:41.751 --> 04:43.459
Then he'll propose shortly

04:41.751 --> 04:43.459
after graduation, and then...

04:43.500 --> 04:45.417
Move to Silver Springs.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.209
He'll get a six figure job

04:45.459 --> 04:47.209
working for an embassy and...

04:47.250 --> 04:48.626
That will be that!

04:48.667 --> 04:50.209
Or you can get

04:48.667 --> 04:50.209
a six figure job.

04:50.709 --> 04:52.792
Okay, whatever. How do I look?

04:53.125 --> 04:54.709
[vibrant music]

04:54.751 --> 04:55.792
You look hot!

04:56.542 --> 04:57.542
Really?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.417
Yeah, seriously you look good.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.167
I don't know...

05:02.334 --> 05:03.751
I just hope I look fuckable.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.709
[Luce] Yeah, I don't know,

05:05.125 --> 05:07.709
I was walking from campus today,

05:08.375 --> 05:11.459
and I just kept finding

05:08.375 --> 05:11.459
these feathers.

05:11.792 --> 05:14.083
Feather, after feather,

05:11.792 --> 05:14.083
after feather...

05:14.125 --> 05:15.292
Feathers?

05:15.876 --> 05:17.792
Yeah,

05:15.876 --> 05:17.792
it's a Native American thing.

05:19.125 --> 05:22.250
Alright, so the guys

05:19.125 --> 05:22.250
say to get there at ten,

05:22.292 --> 05:23.918
and bring some money

05:22.292 --> 05:23.918
for the keg.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.334
[Luce] Are you sure?

05:25.876 --> 05:28.375
Whatever, I'm sure

05:25.876 --> 05:28.375
he was just like suggesting it.

05:28.417 --> 05:30.751
[Luce] Don't defend him

05:28.417 --> 05:30.751
because you used to blow him.

05:31.709 --> 05:34.500
Okay, it's not like I sucked

05:31.709 --> 05:34.500
the life out of him.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.000
-I only did it once!

05:34.542 --> 05:37.000
-[girls laughing]

05:37.042 --> 05:38.542
Can you please pour me

05:37.042 --> 05:38.542
more of that wine?

05:38.584 --> 05:39.751
[Luce] Oh, sure thing.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.250
Thanks again for the wine, Kort.

05:41.292 --> 05:42.959
Anything for you, Mary.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.042
[Pam] Don't thank her,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.042
her parents bought it.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.834
Anyway...

05:47.876 --> 05:49.292
You serious,

05:47.876 --> 05:49.292
you don't want to come out now?

05:49.334 --> 05:50.542
I don't know.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.792
My stomach's

05:51.083 --> 05:52.792
kind of bothering me.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.626
-[Kort] Really?

05:52.834 --> 05:54.626
-Yeah!

05:55.042 --> 05:56.626
Who do you say

05:55.042 --> 05:56.626
is going to be there?

05:56.667 --> 05:58.125
Will you just shut up

05:56.667 --> 05:58.125
and get drunk with me?

05:58.167 --> 05:59.626
[Allie sighing]

05:59.667 --> 06:01.792
Please don't leave me with them.

06:01.834 --> 06:05.375
-Okay, I get it. I'm your rock.

06:01.834 --> 06:05.375
-[Kort] You are.

06:05.417 --> 06:06.792
[glasses clinking]

06:05.417 --> 06:06.792
[giggling]

06:06.834 --> 06:08.834
Fuck it!

06:08.876 --> 06:11.125
[Luce] Are you two

06:08.876 --> 06:11.125
just going to sit in there

06:08.876 --> 06:11.125
and scissor all night,

06:11.167 --> 06:12.334
or come fucking party with us?

06:12.375 --> 06:14.584
[loud upbeat music]

06:12.375 --> 06:14.584
[unintelligible chatter]

06:22.792 --> 06:23.959
Go, go, go!

06:27.292 --> 06:28.709
There we go, girl!

06:28.751 --> 06:29.792
Yes!

06:31.334 --> 06:33.792
Hey, hey, now come on!

06:38.375 --> 06:40.292
[yelling]

06:41.209 --> 06:44.000
Hey, dude, is that the way

06:41.209 --> 06:44.000
I do that for you?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.417
Shall we go get [inaudible]?

06:46.459 --> 06:48.167
Yeah! Let's go!

06:52.792 --> 06:54.000
She's so cool!

06:56.167 --> 06:57.626
[Allie] Okay, wait,

06:56.167 --> 06:57.626
how are my boobs?

06:57.667 --> 06:58.918
-You look good!

06:57.667 --> 06:58.918
-[Allie] I do?

06:58.959 --> 06:59.959
-Yeah.

06:58.959 --> 06:59.959
-Do they look big?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.167
I want them to look big.

07:01.209 --> 07:02.334
-Yes!

07:01.209 --> 07:02.334
-[Allie] They do?

07:02.375 --> 07:03.417
Go back to what you were saying.

07:03.459 --> 07:04.667
[Allie] Oh my god! Okay!

07:04.709 --> 07:07.334
So, my schedule is the shit.

07:07.792 --> 07:10.209
No classes on Friday,

07:07.792 --> 07:10.209
like ever.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.584
No classes before 1pm, and...

07:12.626 --> 07:14.667
two of my classes

07:12.626 --> 07:14.667
only meet once a week.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.959
It's a fucking joke!

07:17.000 --> 07:18.542
Your parents

07:17.000 --> 07:18.542
must be really proud.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.500
They should be!

07:18.584 --> 07:20.500
I'm kind of a genius!

07:21.083 --> 07:22.209
Okay, what is this?

07:22.542 --> 07:24.459
Yeah, I called this

07:22.542 --> 07:24.459
the Ben Affleck,

07:24.500 --> 07:26.918
because when you drink it,

07:24.500 --> 07:26.918
you're going to be gone girl.

07:26.959 --> 07:28.250
[Kort] Oh Shit!

07:32.792 --> 07:34.834
-[coughing] It's terrible!

07:32.792 --> 07:34.834
-[Allie] What? It's so good.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.876
-No, it's not.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.876
-Excuse me Kortney...

07:36.918 --> 07:37.834
Who is it?

07:39.709 --> 07:41.042
I have no idea.

07:41.584 --> 07:42.584
Is he hot?

07:43.459 --> 07:45.292
He's... Gorgeous! Top ten.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.209
-Hey!

07:51.083 --> 07:52.209
-Hi.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.709
[nervous laughter]

07:53.751 --> 07:55.959
Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude,

07:53.751 --> 07:55.959
I just...

07:56.584 --> 07:58.292
I thought you were

07:56.584 --> 07:58.292
really pretty.

07:58.626 --> 08:03.042
I got your name from...

07:58.626 --> 08:03.042
a friend.

08:05.209 --> 08:06.167
Was that creepy?

08:06.876 --> 08:08.000
A little bit.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.417
[laughing]

08:09.459 --> 08:11.500
-Okay, can I try again?

08:09.459 --> 08:11.500
-Yeah.

08:14.459 --> 08:16.083
-I'm Daniel...

08:14.459 --> 08:16.083
-[music intensifies]

08:16.125 --> 08:18.042
[door unlocking]

08:20.292 --> 08:21.709
[Mary sighing]

08:22.083 --> 08:23.209
[Kort] Can you hurry up?

08:24.000 --> 08:27.292
Waste Of time!

08:31.417 --> 08:33.208
Seriously, now you want

08:31.417 --> 08:33.208
to hang out?

08:33.250 --> 08:35.167
Who wants to hang out?

08:35.208 --> 08:36.833
Kyle! He doesn't talk to me

08:35.208 --> 08:36.833
all night and then suddenly

08:36.876 --> 08:39.042
he wants to "watch a movie".

08:36.876 --> 08:39.042
I mean, it's--

08:39.417 --> 08:41.167
[Mary] Ahh...

08:51.000 --> 08:52.918
[Allie]

08:51.000 --> 08:52.918
So, what the fuck

08:51.000 --> 08:52.918
did you talk about?

08:53.334 --> 08:56.876
Um... He said he's new...

08:57.375 --> 08:59.083
No shit he's new dude.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.083
A hottie like that

08:59.125 --> 09:01.167
doesn't just fly under the radar

08:59.125 --> 09:01.167
for three years.

09:01.209 --> 09:02.417
Jeez!

09:02.459 --> 09:03.626
Sorry, go on.

09:04.292 --> 09:06.542
Um... He transferred

09:04.292 --> 09:06.542
for lacrosse...

09:06.584 --> 09:08.042
[Allie] Ugh, duh!

09:08.083 --> 09:09.459
He's going to be a junior

09:08.083 --> 09:09.459
in the classroom

09:09.500 --> 09:11.500
and a senior on the field.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.417
Oh my god, no way!

09:11.542 --> 09:13.417
He still has

09:11.542 --> 09:13.417
two full seasons left?

09:13.459 --> 09:15.459
Yeah, I think he said something

09:13.459 --> 09:15.459
about redshirting or--

09:15.500 --> 09:18.876
Oh my god, I don't care about

09:15.500 --> 09:18.876
his fucking NCAA eligibility.

to penetrate you.

09:25.834 --> 09:27.667
-Yeah... Okay.

09:29.042 --> 09:30.667
[Allie] What's his first

09:29.042 --> 09:30.667
and last name?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.042
-I'm gonna Facebook this bitch.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.042
-When did you get this?

09:33.083 --> 09:35.167
Oh, I convinced my parents

09:33.083 --> 09:35.167
that it would help me

09:35.209 --> 09:37.876
do better in school,

09:35.209 --> 09:37.876
but I totally just use it

09:35.209 --> 09:37.876
to watch porn.

09:37.918 --> 09:39.042
You know what I need?

09:39.626 --> 09:41.167
I got his first name, Daniel.

09:39.626 --> 09:41.167
That's it.

09:41.667 --> 09:44.000
They're five fucking Daniels

more than that.

I think his eyes are blue...

09:50.250 --> 09:51.792
His eyes are blue?

That's not

10:33.000 --> 10:34.500
Just a little research.

10:35.751 --> 10:37.375
Okay, here's the deal.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.000
I talked to the boat shoe crew

10:37.417 --> 10:39.000
over there,

10:39.042 --> 10:40.667
and they said

10:39.042 --> 10:40.667
his last name is McMullen.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.334
He's single.

10:43.584 --> 10:44.500
[laughing] Okay.

10:45.584 --> 10:46.709
And he transferred here

10:45.584 --> 10:46.709
from Maryland.

10:46.751 --> 10:48.375
Like I said.

10:48.417 --> 10:50.042
He sat out last year

10:48.417 --> 10:50.042
because of an injury.

It's a lake!

Do you know what that means?

11:01.042 --> 11:03.292
His family has

11:01.042 --> 11:03.292
a fucking lake house!

11:03.834 --> 11:05.500
I like those shutters.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.209

11:12.042 --> 11:13.083
What?

11:14.584 --> 11:17.209
Okay. Any guy with two sisters

11:14.584 --> 11:17.209
or more is twice as nice.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.500
It's like a rule of thumb.

11:19.209 --> 11:20.459
That's kind of sweet.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.751
Okay, what I'm saying is

11:22.250 --> 11:23.751
I approve.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.334

that the United States

13:38.459 --> 13:41.375
at the beginning of the 1930s,

had not fully asserted itself

Oh, my bad!

13:57.459 --> 13:58.709
[lecturer 2] Let's begin

13:57.459 --> 13:58.709
by understanding

13:58.751 --> 14:00.918
what bottlenecks truly are.

14:01.584 --> 14:05.125
Bottlenecks are, contrary

14:01.584 --> 14:05.125
to what you may believe,

where the performance...

speaking inaudibly]

14:14.125 --> 14:16.083
Generally speaking.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.083
Now, for example...

14:16.334 --> 14:18.626
[lecturer 1] Until 1941,

14:16.334 --> 14:18.626
and in that period,

14:18.667 --> 14:22.042
the US struggled to figure out

14:18.667 --> 14:22.042
a way to become involved

14:22.083 --> 14:23.709
and insure its place

14:23.751 --> 14:25.459
as the Guardian

14:23.751 --> 14:25.459
of the western hemisphere,

14:25.500 --> 14:27.792
without actually

14:25.500 --> 14:27.792
involving troops.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.834
Now this process would go on

14:27.834 --> 14:30.834
to become known

under the rhetorical umbrella

14:30.876 --> 14:34.417
of "The Good Neighbor Policy".

And one of the ways

14:34.459 --> 14:36.083
they did that...

[lecturer 2] ...with the same

14:55.751 --> 14:58.250
two widget line flow systems,

14:58.292 --> 15:00.083
where you have

14:58.292 --> 15:00.083

15:00.125 --> 15:03.167
with the same processing speed

15:00.125 --> 15:03.167

15:06.250 --> 15:09.334
So, you see by adding

15:06.250 --> 15:09.334
one additional widget maker,

15:09.375 --> 15:13.083
we're able to diffuse

15:09.375 --> 15:13.083

And therefore as a whole

35:58.500 --> 36:00.918
I hate that word, but... yes.

36:02.292 --> 36:04.459
I like to think that

36:02.292 --> 36:04.459
I came from a good family.

36:06.417 --> 36:08.500
What about you? Are your...

36:08.542 --> 36:09.667
Are your parents happy?

36:10.250 --> 36:12.209
Yeah! They're happy it's just...

36:12.250 --> 36:14.000
not with each other.

36:14.626 --> 36:15.709
As simple as that?

36:16.250 --> 36:17.292
Yeah.

36:19.918 --> 36:21.083
Do you mind

36:19.918 --> 36:21.083
if I change the subject?

36:21.125 --> 36:22.375
Yes, please.

36:22.417 --> 36:23.709
[laughing]

36:24.709 --> 36:27.000
Oh, hey,

36:24.709 --> 36:27.000
what does Allie think of me?

36:27.459 --> 36:29.375
Did I... pass the test?

36:30.334 --> 36:31.918
I don't know.

36:31.959 --> 36:33.250
We don't really talk

36:31.959 --> 36:33.250
about you that much.

36:37.125 --> 36:39.250
[Allie singing]

36:40.959 --> 36:42.959
[sighing] So stupid!

36:43.751 --> 36:46.584
Oh, I'm famous, I'm pretty.

36:46.626 --> 36:48.292
Oh, I'm married.

36:48.334 --> 36:49.334
-Hey, Allie.

36:48.334 --> 36:49.334
-Hey.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.834
Whatever! Fuck you, Mom!

36:51.083 --> 36:53.500
I know it's your money,

36:51.083 --> 36:53.500
but it's my credit card.

36:53.834 --> 36:55.292
It has my name on it.

36:55.334 --> 36:57.209
[melodic music]

36:57.250 --> 36:59.500
Oh... Hello...

37:08.751 --> 37:10.125
[Daniel] Hey, Kort...

37:10.417 --> 37:13.167
[music intensifies]

37:17.250 --> 37:18.667
Um... Will you date me?

37:20.334 --> 37:23.959
[speech drown out

37:20.334 --> 37:23.959
by louder music]

37:32.292 --> 37:33.792
Okay, what are you thinking?

37:35.918 --> 37:37.292
I'm thinking...

37:45.250 --> 37:46.500
[door opening]

37:48.542 --> 37:49.918
What the fuck is this?

37:49.959 --> 37:51.834
-[Kort] What?

37:49.959 --> 37:51.834
-You're dating?

37:52.584 --> 37:54.500
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:54.876 --> 37:56.000
Hello.

37:56.334 --> 37:57.375
Hi.

37:58.209 --> 37:59.959
Kitchen! Yesterday!

38:02.334 --> 38:03.375
Allie...

38:10.125 --> 38:11.792
[Allie]

38:10.125 --> 38:11.792
Were you not even going

38:10.125 --> 38:11.792
to tell me about this?

38:11.834 --> 38:13.125
[Kort] What are you

38:11.834 --> 38:13.125
talking about?

38:13.167 --> 38:15.000
It just happened

38:13.167 --> 38:15.000
ten minutes ago.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.042
I thought you'd be happy for me.

38:23.292 --> 38:24.375
I am.

38:28.167 --> 38:29.417
Seriously, I am.

38:31.751 --> 38:34.000
Now, I want you to notice

38:36.584 --> 38:38.792
both on the front end,

38:36.584 --> 38:38.792
and on the back.

38:39.542 --> 38:42.250
For example,

38:39.542 --> 38:42.250
if the factory is operating

38:42.500 --> 38:45.751
at its optimal capacity,

38:42.500 --> 38:45.751
and there are zero bottlenecks,

38:46.209 --> 38:47.834
everything should be fine,

38:46.209 --> 38:47.834
right?

38:49.459 --> 38:50.417
Wrong!

38:50.459 --> 38:52.250
Because, even if

38:52.542 --> 38:54.709
everything has been taken

38:52.542 --> 38:54.709
care of on the front end,

38:58.959 --> 39:01.500
Now, what am I talking about?

38:58.959 --> 39:01.500
Daniel!

39:03.959 --> 39:05.125
Um...

39:09.375 --> 39:11.209
Exactly! Elaborate.

39:13.209 --> 39:14.542
Um...

39:17.417 --> 39:21.667
It's kind of like

39:17.417 --> 39:21.667
when your factory,

39:22.042 --> 39:23.417
it makes stuff,

39:24.876 --> 39:26.584
but at the same time

39:28.834 --> 39:33.542
enough other stuff to keep

39:28.834 --> 39:33.542
all the machines happy.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.292
Right?

39:41.250 --> 39:42.667
[whispering] You're an idiot!

39:45.250 --> 39:46.751
Not as far off

39:45.250 --> 39:46.751
as you would think.

39:47.209 --> 39:48.626
To the big board.

39:48.667 --> 39:50.209
[melodic music resumes]

39:50.250 --> 39:51.292
Huh!

40:02.250 --> 40:08.042
[Allie humming then whistling]

40:14.834 --> 40:18.167
Mmm, look at this little cup

40:14.834 --> 40:18.167
of fuck pudding!

40:19.375 --> 40:20.751
Mmm...

40:21.083 --> 40:23.417
I'd like to give you a tour

40:21.083 --> 40:23.417
of this campus!

40:24.417 --> 40:26.334
Are those jeans from Europe?

40:26.918 --> 40:28.417
Just kidding, come back!

40:41.959 --> 40:43.334
Who are you listening to?

40:43.667 --> 40:44.792
Um... Nelly...

40:46.083 --> 40:47.042
Furtado.

40:47.500 --> 40:48.959
What?

41:13.542 --> 41:15.292
[Kort] Oh, this is cute!

41:15.334 --> 41:17.542
-Do you want to try that on?

41:15.334 --> 41:17.542
-Oh, no that's okay.

41:17.584 --> 41:19.000
-Sure?

41:17.584 --> 41:19.000
-[Daniel] Why not, come on!

41:19.459 --> 41:20.500
It'll look good on you.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.959
Why don't you try something on?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.209
[laughing]

41:26.626 --> 41:28.125
[laughing]

41:28.584 --> 41:31.042
I just... I don't think

41:28.584 --> 41:31.042
it's sitting on me quite right.

41:32.459 --> 41:34.209
[seller] I know something

41:32.459 --> 41:34.209
that will sit on you!

41:35.083 --> 41:36.626
-Honey, no!

41:35.083 --> 41:36.626
-What?

41:38.584 --> 41:39.626
It's legal now!

41:40.375 --> 41:42.459
[Allie humming]

41:54.876 --> 41:56.083
What are you doing? Stop!

41:56.125 --> 41:57.459
I do not respond well to this.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.334
[laughing] What?

41:59.375 --> 42:00.667
Come on, do it for me.

42:00.918 --> 42:01.959
D-Man.

42:02.375 --> 42:03.542
Who is D-Man?

42:03.918 --> 42:05.876
-It's just what they

42:03.918 --> 42:05.876
used to call me

42:05.918 --> 42:07.584
back in the hood.

42:08.709 --> 42:09.876
[Kort] Give me the spoon!

42:10.876 --> 42:12.375
I will take the spoon!

42:12.417 --> 42:13.918
[Daniel] Come on,

42:12.417 --> 42:13.918
that's not fun.

42:13.959 --> 42:15.042
That's no fun.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.000
[Allie] Mmm...

42:17.918 --> 42:19.209
It's so good!

42:28.250 --> 42:30.709
-[car honking]

42:28.250 --> 42:30.709
-Go fuck yourself!

42:34.834 --> 42:36.626
So, you've really never

42:34.834 --> 42:36.626
played before?

42:37.083 --> 42:38.167
Nope!

42:41.584 --> 42:43.292
-Okay.

42:41.584 --> 42:43.292
-What I'm doing right here

42:43.334 --> 42:44.834
is called cradling.

42:44.876 --> 42:46.083
-Okay.

42:44.876 --> 42:46.083
-So, it's like as if you were,

42:46.125 --> 42:47.584
-you know--

42:46.125 --> 42:47.584
-Cradling.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.959
[Daniel] I'm going to toss you

42:49.500 --> 42:50.959
the ball now.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.834
So just kind of accept it

42:52.876 --> 42:55.500
as opposed to trying to catch

42:52.876 --> 42:55.500
it as if you're a statue.

42:55.542 --> 42:57.125
-Okay. Like this?

42:55.542 --> 42:57.125
-[Daniel] Right?

42:57.167 --> 42:58.334
-[Daniel] Yes.

42:57.167 --> 42:58.334
-Okay.

43:02.417 --> 43:04.209
-I'm impressed!

43:02.417 --> 43:04.209
-Beginner's luck!

43:07.417 --> 43:08.500
take it back as--

43:09.083 --> 43:10.417
[Kort laughing]

43:11.292 --> 43:14.584
I... I got in

43:11.292 --> 43:14.584
on a lacrosse scholarship!

43:14.876 --> 43:16.292
-Hmm.

43:14.876 --> 43:16.292
-Allie too.

43:16.751 --> 43:18.417
[Daniel] So now

43:16.751 --> 43:18.417
we have trust issues.

43:18.459 --> 43:20.209
So, thank you for that!

43:20.250 --> 43:21.375
[laughing]

43:42.250 --> 43:43.626
[Daniel] So, why did you quit?

43:44.417 --> 43:45.459
[Kort] I don't know...

43:47.834 --> 43:49.959
I mean, I like lacrosse,

43:47.834 --> 43:49.959
it's just...

43:50.626 --> 43:52.834
college sports

43:50.626 --> 43:52.834
are a lot of work, you know?

43:53.417 --> 43:55.459
I just don't know

43:53.417 --> 43:55.459
if it's really worth it.

43:57.459 --> 43:58.792
For me, at least.

43:59.876 --> 44:01.334
But it got me into a school

44:01.375 --> 44:02.709
I probably shouldn't

44:01.375 --> 44:02.709
have gotten into.

44:02.751 --> 44:03.959
[Daniel laughing]

44:04.000 --> 44:05.125
I knew it!

44:05.709 --> 44:06.792
[Kort] What?

44:07.959 --> 44:09.167
I knew that you were dumb.

44:09.209 --> 44:10.459
-I knew it!

44:09.209 --> 44:10.459
-I'm dumb?

44:10.500 --> 44:11.751
[Daniel] I just knew it!

44:12.417 --> 44:13.500
Rude!

44:14.459 --> 44:15.751
[Daniel] I'm joking.

44:16.834 --> 44:17.959
What about Allie?

44:18.209 --> 44:19.751
Did she just quit

44:18.209 --> 44:19.751
because you quit?

44:20.626 --> 44:22.542
[Kort] To be fair, no.

44:26.125 --> 44:29.667
I just think she's... lazy.

44:37.626 --> 44:38.751
Hey, Pam!

44:38.792 --> 44:39.876
Yeah?

44:42.083 --> 44:44.000
Have you ever felt like...

44:45.083 --> 44:46.459
you're happy for someone...

44:47.834 --> 44:49.125
uh, you know, like...

44:50.626 --> 44:52.250
like you're happy for someone...

44:53.292 --> 44:55.209
I mean you're completely

44:53.292 --> 44:55.209
happy for them,

44:55.834 --> 44:57.209
but you're like...

44:58.751 --> 44:59.792
want what they have...

44:59.834 --> 45:01.584
Oh! Yeah!

45:01.626 --> 45:03.918
[laughs] I'm jealous

45:01.626 --> 45:03.918
all the time!

45:03.959 --> 45:05.417
-No!

45:03.959 --> 45:05.417
-I mean I'm jealous of you

45:05.459 --> 45:06.751
for being funnier than me.

45:06.792 --> 45:08.626
And Kort for being prettier,

45:08.667 --> 45:10.751
and Mary for eating less

45:08.667 --> 45:10.751
than me at dinner.

45:10.792 --> 45:13.709
And Luce for sexting

45:10.792 --> 45:13.709
all the lacrosse guys,

45:13.751 --> 45:15.751
even though I do find it

45:13.751 --> 45:15.751
morally questionable,

45:15.792 --> 45:18.334
slash, would secretly

45:15.792 --> 45:18.334
do the same.

45:18.918 --> 45:22.292
And Jen for saying

45:18.918 --> 45:22.292
the shit that I think

45:22.334 --> 45:24.250
but I'm actually

45:22.334 --> 45:24.250
too scared to say.

45:25.292 --> 45:26.375
Huh!

45:27.959 --> 45:29.000
Why, what's up?

45:30.584 --> 45:31.626
Nothing!

45:34.459 --> 45:35.959
Okay, well...

45:36.292 --> 45:37.959
I'm going to go do some laundry.

45:39.125 --> 45:40.167
Bye.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.500
[Kort] Hey, Allie!

46:20.542 --> 46:22.667
Daniel and I are going to go

46:20.542 --> 46:22.667
and catch a movie if you want--

46:33.292 --> 46:34.542
I'm so sorry.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.209
Hey, Mar!

46:37.250 --> 46:38.500
-Hey... um...

46:37.250 --> 46:38.500
-What's going on?

46:38.542 --> 46:40.500
Can I talk to you for a second?

46:40.542 --> 46:41.626
Yeah?

46:42.417 --> 46:43.667
Okay... um...

46:45.083 --> 46:46.667
Daniel was in my dream

46:45.083 --> 46:46.667
last night.

46:48.542 --> 46:50.792
We were in South Carolina

46:48.542 --> 46:50.792
eating Chick-fil-A,

46:51.876 --> 46:53.459
even though it was a Sunday,

46:53.500 --> 46:56.417
and it started out slow,

46:53.500 --> 46:56.417
but by the end of it

46:56.792 --> 46:59.209
he had me kind of over

46:56.792 --> 46:59.209
the back of his Chevy

46:59.250 --> 47:01.500
and was raw dogging me,

46:59.250 --> 47:01.500
on the hood.

47:03.542 --> 47:04.792
I'm really sorry.

47:07.125 --> 47:08.209
Okay...

47:09.542 --> 47:12.876
Thank you for... being honest.

47:18.250 --> 47:19.375
What?

47:33.792 --> 47:36.292
[oil sizzling]

47:39.334 --> 47:41.542
Oh, fancy seeing you here!

47:42.751 --> 47:44.167
What's that supposed to mean?

47:44.542 --> 47:45.584
Nothing, I just...

47:48.584 --> 47:50.250
Crazy!

47:50.292 --> 47:52.542
But... I think I have

47:50.292 --> 47:52.542
something fun for us!

47:53.751 --> 47:54.709
Oh yeah?

47:55.209 --> 47:56.626
You want cheese on this, right?

47:57.042 --> 47:58.959
Yes, please.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.500
Okay. So, Daniel's friend,

47:59.000 --> 48:02.500
also name is Daniel, actually,

48:02.542 --> 48:06.584
is renting out the [unclear]

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.334
but um...

01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:39.959
It... it's just tough to chew

01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:39.959
and... swallow.

01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:45.959
Yeah, I kind of saw this coming.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.083
[Daniel] Yes! Real food!

01:13:48.417 --> 01:13:52.250
[exhilarating music]

01:13:52.292 --> 01:13:53.959
Do you mind

01:13:52.292 --> 01:13:53.959
if I have a sip of this?

01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:58.542
So are you going to hold this

01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:58.542
over my head forever?

01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:02.751
I don't know!

01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:02.751
I just might though.

01:14:02.792 --> 01:14:04.584
Would make up sex help?

01:14:04.626 --> 01:14:06.083
[laughing]

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:07.542
Is that all you girls

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:07.542
think about?

01:14:07.584 --> 01:14:09.250
-Mmm.

01:14:07.584 --> 01:14:09.250
-[Daniel] It is, isn't it?

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:11.751
-What, it's been like a week!

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:11.751
-[Daniel] Really!

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:15.542
What? Are you not going to help?

01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:19.334
Um... She...

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:21.500
She handcuffed me to the table!

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:23.375
-[laughing] Oh my god!

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:23.375
-[Daniel] Yeah!

01:14:40.918 --> 01:14:42.500
So, how's it going out there?

01:14:43.834 --> 01:14:45.375
Looks like it's going well!

01:14:45.876 --> 01:14:48.125
I mean... not that I'm watching!

01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:49.834
I'm not! I'm just...

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:51.209
From the few glances

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:51.209
that I've stolen, it...

01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:52.876
Looks like it's going well!

01:14:54.375 --> 01:14:56.209
And I only saw those glances

01:14:56.250 --> 01:15:00.209
because I want to keep

01:14:56.250 --> 01:15:00.209
the standard of service high.

01:15:00.834 --> 01:15:01.792
Sure.

01:15:03.042 --> 01:15:05.000
-[Kort] Yeah, it's going well!

01:15:03.042 --> 01:15:05.000
-Good.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:06.459
I like him.

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:08.751
Yeah...

01:15:10.167 --> 01:15:11.334
[Allie] Me too.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:13.792
So why did you act like that?

01:15:16.959 --> 01:15:19.751
I... don't know,

01:15:16.959 --> 01:15:19.751
I guess it was just...

01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:22.709
more fun when we

01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:22.709
were chasing them together,

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:25.167
than when you

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:25.167
were dating him alone.

01:15:26.125 --> 01:15:28.042
Yeah, I guess

01:15:26.125 --> 01:15:28.042
I wasn't the best...

01:15:28.083 --> 01:15:29.417
best friend, was I?

01:15:30.542 --> 01:15:32.626
I kind of got caught up

01:15:30.542 --> 01:15:32.626
there for a while.

01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:39.042
Hey um...

01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:42.042
You didn't mean

01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:42.042
that abroad thing, did you?

01:15:44.959 --> 01:15:46.500
Yeah... I did.

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.959
I mean,

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.959
not for those reasons but...

01:15:51.042 --> 01:15:52.709
I never really wanted to go.

01:15:53.876 --> 01:15:54.918
Okay.

01:15:59.584 --> 01:16:01.209
Can I give you some good news?

01:16:02.459 --> 01:16:04.542
Yes, now would be a good time.

01:16:06.125 --> 01:16:07.751
He has a friend

01:16:06.125 --> 01:16:07.751
that thinks you're hot.

01:16:08.959 --> 01:16:10.042
[tranquil music]

01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:11.709
Proceed.

01:16:11.751 --> 01:16:14.209
Apparently, he thinks

01:16:11.751 --> 01:16:14.209
you have a nice ass!

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.209
This ass?

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.918
That ass!

01:16:18.209 --> 01:16:19.626
Okay, I'll take it!

01:16:20.083 --> 01:16:21.792
He wants to take you

01:16:20.083 --> 01:16:21.792
out for a drink.

01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:23.334
-Shut the fuck up!

01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:23.334
-[glass breaking]

01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:24.792
[laughing] Oh my god!

01:16:24.834 --> 01:16:25.959
Whatever.

01:16:24.834 --> 01:16:25.959
I did that to be dramatic!

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.334
I fucking hate that plate!

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.959
Tell me what

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.959
we are working with?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.334
[music picks up tempo]

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:35.292
You look good!

01:16:35.334 --> 01:16:37.417
-[Allie] Stop that!

01:16:35.334 --> 01:16:37.417
-How do you feel?

01:16:38.584 --> 01:16:40.334
I feel good. I do.

01:16:41.542 --> 01:16:42.959
I'm a little nervous though.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.292
You can be nervous.

01:16:44.542 --> 01:16:45.918
You're just not allowed

01:16:44.542 --> 01:16:45.918
to fuck him!

01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:48.292
Does that rule still stand?

01:16:48.334 --> 01:16:50.083
-[Kort] Yes!

01:16:48.334 --> 01:16:50.083
-Like a 100%?

01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:51.375
[Kort] Yes, you slut!

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.667
Great!

01:16:55.876 --> 01:16:57.042
The dress looks good too.

01:16:57.083 --> 01:16:59.250
[Allie sighing] Really?

01:16:59.751 --> 01:17:02.459
I don't know, kind of feel

01:16:59.751 --> 01:17:02.459
like I'm made for these things.

01:17:05.918 --> 01:17:07.459
-[Kort] Alright, perfume?

01:17:05.918 --> 01:17:07.459
-[Allie] Check!

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.751
-[Kort] ID?

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.751
-[Allie] Check!

01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:09.834
And...?

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.834
[Allie] It's the first date!

01:17:11.876 --> 01:17:13.167
I'm just asking!

01:17:13.626 --> 01:17:14.751
I trimmed!

01:17:15.125 --> 01:17:16.542
Daniel, thoughts?

01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:19.751
Gorgeous!

01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:23.209
-It's very sweet of you D-Mac.

01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:23.209
-[Kort chuckling]

01:17:26.083 --> 01:17:27.292
Okay. Go on.

01:17:27.834 --> 01:17:29.542
[Allie] I... oh, bye!

01:17:29.584 --> 01:17:30.751
[laughing]

by Alex Winston]

01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:12.834
[hostess] Can I help you?

01:18:13.417 --> 01:18:14.876
Huh?

01:18:14.918 --> 01:18:15.792
[hostess] Are you looking

01:18:14.918 --> 01:18:15.792
for someone?

01:18:15.834 --> 01:18:17.918
Oh! No.

[sighing] I'm okay!

Oh, would you look

01:22:05.876 --> 01:22:08.834
at the slice of apple pie!

Come over here, cutie!
