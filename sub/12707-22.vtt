00:01.234 --> 00:03.003
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer--

00:03.036 --> 00:04.838
You are the Slayer.

00:04.871 --> 00:07.341
Into each generation,
a Slayer is born.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.743
-Why don't we start
with, "Hi. I'm Buffy"?
-Xander.

00:09.776 --> 00:10.977
-Cordelia.
-Willow, right?

00:11.010 --> 00:12.179
-Mr. Giles.
-Angel.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.765
(exhales)

01:04.798 --> 01:07.367
Gave me
a pretty good run there.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.602
Bet the blood's just pumpin'.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.206
Bet it's hot.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.710
-Don't hurt me.
-Don't hurt you?

01:16.743 --> 01:19.212
-(laughs)
-(door opening)

01:19.246 --> 01:22.415
-Hey, what's going on?
-(growls)

01:22.450 --> 01:25.118
Help me!
Call the police!

01:25.152 --> 01:26.754
Get outta here, girl.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.789
You guys havin' a fight?

01:28.822 --> 01:31.825
'Cause, you know,
fighting's not cool.

01:31.859 --> 01:35.596
-Get outta here!
-No.

01:35.628 --> 01:41.801
No, she wants to stay.
I don't mind a little appetizer.

01:41.835 --> 01:45.206
Have you ever heard
the expression, "biting off
more than you can chew?"

01:46.307 --> 01:47.408
Okay.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.009
Um, how 'bout
the expression,

01:50.043 --> 01:53.180
-"Vampire Slayer"?
-What the hell
you talkin' about?

01:53.213 --> 01:55.248
Wow,
never heard that one.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.685
Okay, how about,

01:57.718 --> 01:59.753
"Oh, god,
my leg, my leg"?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.522
(snarls)

02:02.555 --> 02:05.293
Oh, god, my leg!

02:05.325 --> 02:07.995
-See?
Now we're communicating.
-(yells)

02:43.030 --> 02:47.600
Wow. Been a long while since
i met one who didn't know me.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.671
You should get home.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.876
How'd you do that?

02:57.211 --> 02:58.746
It's what I do.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.581
But you're--
you're just a girl.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.555
That's what I keep saying.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.430
(theme music playing)

04:07.781 --> 04:09.917
Something going on
out back?

04:09.949 --> 04:12.151
-Vampire.
-Oh.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.253
(sighs)
Anything?

04:17.156 --> 04:19.992
Nothing you want to hear.
The ritual is--

04:20.026 --> 04:23.331
-Explain it again.
-There's nothing new to--

04:23.363 --> 04:25.432
Go through it again.

04:33.005 --> 04:35.808
The key was
living energy.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.579
It needed to be
channeled, poured

04:38.612 --> 04:41.314
into a specific place
at a specific time.

04:41.348 --> 04:45.284
The energy would
flow into that spot.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.855
The walls between the
dimensions break down.

04:47.887 --> 04:51.824
It stops.
The energy's used up
the walls come back up.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.627
Glory uses that time to get
back into her own dimension,

04:54.661 --> 04:56.797
not caring that
all manner of hell

04:56.829 --> 05:00.468
will be unleashed on
earth in the meantime.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.103
Um... But only for
a little while, right?
The walls come back,

05:04.137 --> 05:06.507
Uh, no more hell?

05:06.540 --> 05:10.009
That's only
if the energy is stopped.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.980
And now
the key is human--

05:14.014 --> 05:15.848
is Dawn.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.687
GILES: "The blood flows.
The gates will open.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.754
The gates will close
when it flows no more."

05:23.423 --> 05:25.091
When Dawn is dead.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.831
I have places to be!
(giggles)

05:34.567 --> 05:38.071
Why blood?
Why Dawn's blood?

05:38.105 --> 05:41.475
I mean, why couldn't it
be like a-- a lymph ritual?

05:41.509 --> 05:43.543
'Cause it's
always got to be blood.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.814
We're not actually
discussing dinner right now.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.382
Blood is life,
lackbrain.

05:49.417 --> 05:53.319
Why do you think we eat it?
It's what keeps you going,

05:53.353 --> 05:56.923
makes you warm,
makes you hard,

05:56.956 --> 05:58.625
makes you
other than dead.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.562
Course
it's her blood.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.598
BUFFY: Pretty simple math here.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.699
We stop Glory before
she can start the ritual.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.701
We still have
a couple of hours, right?

06:08.735 --> 06:10.571
If my calculations
are right.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.839
-But, Buffy--
-I don't wanna hear it.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.843
-I understand that.
-No! No, you don't understand!

06:15.875 --> 06:18.911
We are not talking
about this.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.980
Yes, we bloody well are!

06:27.654 --> 06:30.189
If Glory
begins the ritual,

06:30.223 --> 06:31.891
if we can't stop her--

06:33.927 --> 06:36.430
Come on. Say it.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.566
We're "bloody well"
 talking about this!

06:40.067 --> 06:41.968
Tell me to kill my sister.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.639
She's not your sister.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.077
No... she's not.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.781
She's more than that.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.084
She's me.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.588
The monks
made her out of me.

07:02.154 --> 07:06.759
I hold her, and I feel
closer to her than--

07:09.329 --> 07:11.865
It's not just
the memories they built.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.300
It's physical.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.038
Dawn is a part of me...

07:19.706 --> 07:22.910
-The only part that I--
-We'll solve this.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.879
We will. Don't have
another coma, okay?

07:29.382 --> 07:31.819
If the ritual starts,
then every living creature

07:31.851 --> 07:34.120
in this and every other
dimension imaginable

07:34.153 --> 07:36.990
will suffer unbearable
torment and death.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.459
Including Dawn.

07:40.494 --> 07:44.031
Then the last thing she'll see
is me protecting her.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.134
You'll fail.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.670
You'll die.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.838
We all will.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.675
I'm sorry.

07:57.810 --> 08:01.480
I love you all,
but I'm sorry.

08:06.553 --> 08:10.322
Okay, all in favor
of stopping Glory
before the ritual--

08:10.356 --> 08:13.726
Suggestions, ideas?
Time's a-wastin'.
(Snapping fingers)

08:13.761 --> 08:16.797
Uh... When you say
you love us all--
GILES AND XANDER: Shut up!

08:16.829 --> 08:19.699
Willow! I bet you've got
some dark spell a-brewin'.

08:19.733 --> 08:23.170
Uh, make her a toad?
Little hoppy toad?

08:23.202 --> 08:26.005
We hit her
with a hammer?
(Tara giggles)

08:26.038 --> 08:27.940
Hoppy toad.
(giggling continues)

08:30.509 --> 08:34.212
What about Ben? He can
be killed, right? I mean,
i know he's an innocent,

08:34.246 --> 08:37.017
but, you know,
not like "Dawn" innocent.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.251
We could kill a--

08:39.285 --> 08:41.120
a regular guy.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.559
God.

08:48.394 --> 08:51.731
It's doubtful he'll surface
again this close to the ritual.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.234
We can expect it's Glory
we're dealing with.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.403
WILLOW: We don't
have to kill her.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.940
We just have to stop her
from doing the ritual.

08:59.972 --> 09:03.076
I mean, there's
only the one time that
she can do it, right?

09:03.110 --> 09:07.114
Yeah. We get her on the ropes,
we just gotta keep her occupied
till it's too late.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.417
Okay. But I'm still
not hearing enough ideas.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.285
She's a God.
Let's think outside the box.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.724
-Why don't you go think
outside the bleeding box.
-Yes, Anya,

09:16.756 --> 09:19.359
apart from
your incredibly
un-infectious enthusiasm,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.729
-have you anything else
to contribute?
-The Dagon Sphere!

09:21.761 --> 09:25.398
-Sorry?
-When Buffy first met Glory,

09:25.432 --> 09:27.267
she found that magical,

09:27.299 --> 09:29.636
glowy sphere that was
meant to repel Glory.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.940
We've got it in the basement.
It might drive her away
or hurt her.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.441
Oh!

09:34.474 --> 09:39.046
And Olaf the Troll God's
enchanted hammer.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.615
You want to fight a God,
use the weapon of a God.

09:41.649 --> 09:44.084
Uh, nah, that thing's
too heavy to--

09:44.116 --> 09:47.453
-Yeah, good.
-I like this.

09:47.486 --> 09:50.256
Thanks.
Here to help.
Wanna live.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.259
Smart chicks
are so hot.

09:53.661 --> 09:57.330
You couldn't have figured
that out in tenth grade?

09:57.364 --> 10:00.500
GILES:
Well, we have some ideas
if we could actually get...

10:00.533 --> 10:02.601
Glory on the run,
but, um--

10:02.635 --> 10:04.804
But we still have no idea
how to find her.

10:04.837 --> 10:07.975
Big day!
Oh, it calls me.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.643
I have to be there!

10:11.144 --> 10:12.679
TARA:
Big day.

10:21.153 --> 10:25.192
They, uh, said you
have to put this on...

10:25.225 --> 10:27.193
for the ceremony.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.164
What if I don't?

10:32.198 --> 10:33.332
Come on. Just--

10:33.365 --> 10:36.102
What if I don't
like the color?

10:36.135 --> 10:39.706
Look, I-- I wish
there was another way.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.610
And I wish you'd fall
on your head and drown
in your own barf, so...

10:43.643 --> 10:45.644
I guess we're
both disappointed.

10:45.678 --> 10:49.950
I think... It'll be quick.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.385
Actually, sir, the bleeding
is quite a slow process,

10:53.419 --> 10:57.256
to give
the portal time to--
Thank you for the information.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.028
-I'll do what I can to--
-Change.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.730
-What?
-Change.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.398
Be her.
I don't want
to look at you.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.835
-Dawn, I don't think you wanna--
-Be Glory.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.837
Be Glory!

11:10.870 --> 11:14.173
-Glory! Glory! Glory!
-Will you just stop

11:14.206 --> 11:15.674
shouting already?

11:20.279 --> 11:22.850
So, what's
the hubbub, bub?

11:22.883 --> 11:26.352
What do you got
against old Benji?

11:26.385 --> 11:29.056
He's a monster.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.691
At least you're
up front about it.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.162
Just don't be
so hard on the boy.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.831
He just
wants to live.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.500
Most guys
would do the same.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.171
Besides, he's probably
the reason your sis and
her little cartoon pals

11:44.203 --> 11:46.173
are still alive.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.174
That little nagging
pinch of humanity...

11:48.207 --> 11:51.211
that makes me go for the hurt
instead of the kill.

11:51.244 --> 11:54.181
Lowering myself to trade
blows with the Slayer

11:54.213 --> 11:57.116
when I should have just
put my fist through her heart.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.585
It's gotta be Ben.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.955
Or maybe you just
can't take her.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.222
Ohh.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.261
-(Dawn gasps)
-(chuckles) Funny thing.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.932
You've been here for a few hours
now, and I haven't seen big sis
galloping in to save you.

12:12.966 --> 12:17.037
She probably knows what
a terrible mistake that'd be.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.774
-She's not afraid of you.
-Oh, no, sweetie baby,

12:20.807 --> 12:24.144
Talkin' about the ritual.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.815
'Cause you know I bleed you,
the portals open.

12:27.847 --> 12:30.482
But once you die,
they close.

12:30.517 --> 12:34.855
The faster you die,
the better for
your sorry species.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.924
I'm bettin'
Buffy knows that.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.725
Since she's not
really your sister,

12:39.759 --> 12:42.761
I'm guessin'
she isn't gonna show.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.835
And if she does...
might not be to save you.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.977
Buffy.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.057
You sure you're not
gonna tire yourself out?
I'm sure.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.528
We're still
working on ideas.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.597
Time's short,
but, uh,

13:18.630 --> 13:20.667
best leave it
to the last moment.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.836
If we go in too early
and she takes us out,

13:22.870 --> 13:25.705
no chance of getting her
to miss her window.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.807
Then we wait.
(grunts)

13:31.577 --> 13:33.880
I imagine
you hate me right now.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.356
I love Dawn.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.525
I know.

13:46.558 --> 13:49.062
But I have sworn to protect
this sorry world,

13:49.096 --> 13:53.299
and sometimes that means
saying and doing...

13:53.332 --> 13:56.302
what other people can't,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.370
what they shouldn't have to.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.076
You try and hurt her,
and you know I'll stop you.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.113
I know.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.293
This is how many
apocalypses for us now?

14:23.395 --> 14:25.432
Oh, uh, well,

14:25.465 --> 14:27.533
six, at least.

14:30.236 --> 14:33.105
Feels like a hundred.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.841
I've always
stopped them,

14:35.875 --> 14:39.245
-Always won.
-Yes.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.883
I sacrificed Angel
to save the world.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.720
I loved him so much.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.659
But I knew...
I was right.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.097
I don't have that anymore.

14:59.731 --> 15:01.500
I don't understand.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.605
I don't know how
to live in this world,

15:05.638 --> 15:07.975
if these are the choices,

15:09.609 --> 15:12.078
if everything
just gets stripped away.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.847
I don't see the point.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.485
I just wish that--

15:24.191 --> 15:27.360
I just wish
my mom was here.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.974
The Spirit Guide told me

15:41.008 --> 15:44.177
that death is my gift.

15:44.211 --> 15:47.947
Guess that means a Slayer
really is just a killer,
after all.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.417
I think you're wrong
about that.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.351
It doesn't matter.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.988
If Dawn dies,

15:55.022 --> 15:58.790
I'm done with it.
I'm quitting.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.508
(whispering)
Everything is prepared.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.682
Okay, campers,
it's almost stab time.
You two, get her.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.886
No! (screams)

16:27.919 --> 16:30.123
Buffy!

16:30.157 --> 16:33.159
-(screaming)
-See ya in a few.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.523
Any luck? Have you found
the Dagon Sphere?

17:03.556 --> 17:06.226
Um,
I'm sure it's here.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.694
-Just be a minute.
-Yeah, we're on it.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.663
Let's look over here,
where we didn't look yet.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.432
GILES:
Time is a factor.

17:13.464 --> 17:16.269
Yes, yes,
not to worry.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.271
(door closes)

17:20.307 --> 17:24.175
So, are you
more relaxed?

17:24.211 --> 17:27.114
-No.
-No?

17:27.146 --> 17:30.282
I mean it sounded
like you, uh...

17:30.317 --> 17:33.885
-arrived.
-No. Yes.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.588
I-- I had
the pleasure moment

17:36.623 --> 17:39.226
and the blissful calm
that comes right after it.

17:39.259 --> 17:42.894
But that only lasted
a couple of seconds,
and now I'm terrified again.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.396
Well,
you don't have to be.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.634
-(gasps)
-What?

17:48.667 --> 17:51.137
Spike's sex-bot.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.339
Why didn't they just
melt it down into scrap?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.608
Maybe Willow
wanted it.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.480
I don't think
Willow feels that way
about Buffy.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.950
I mean, I know she's gone
through a lot of changes, but--

18:03.982 --> 18:05.251
To study it.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.319
Right.

18:07.354 --> 18:10.356
Robotics. Science.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.228
-ANYA:
pervert.
-Other pervert.

18:15.261 --> 18:19.566
And don't frighten me
like that!

18:19.598 --> 18:22.568
God, who-- who would put
something like that there?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.172
Is this supposed to be
some sort of sick joke?

18:25.204 --> 18:27.606
I mean, things
aren't bad enough.

18:29.308 --> 18:32.111
-This is an omen.
-Hey, hey-hey. Shh.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.580
No, no, no, it's an omen!
It's a higher power,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.516
Trying to tell me
through bunnies
that we're all gonna die.

18:36.548 --> 18:39.152
-Oh, god.
-No, it's not.

18:40.819 --> 18:45.023
-It's okay.
-No, you see,

18:45.057 --> 18:47.426
Usually, when there's
an apocalypse, I skedaddle.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.596
But now,
I love you so much
that, instead,

18:49.628 --> 18:53.200
I have inappropriately
timed sex and try to think
of ways to fight a God.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.867
And worry terribly that
something might happen to you.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.136
And also worry
that something'll
happen to me.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.007
And then I have guilt
that I'm not more worried
about everyone else,

19:01.039 --> 19:03.343
but I just
don't have enough.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.179
I'm just on total overload,
and I honestly don't think

19:06.212 --> 19:09.249
that I could be more nervous
than I am right now.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.050
Care to wager on that?

19:18.758 --> 19:21.126
Anya,

19:21.160 --> 19:22.994
you wanna marry me?

19:28.268 --> 19:31.304
Can I take that
as a "maybe"?
You're proposing to me!

19:31.337 --> 19:35.407
Yes.
You're proposing to me
'cause we're gonna die.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.845
And-- and you think
it's romantic and sexy,

19:38.877 --> 19:41.681
and you know you're not gonna
have to go through with it
'cause the world's gonna end!

19:41.713 --> 19:44.683
I'm proposing
to you, Anya,
because it's not.

19:44.717 --> 19:48.555
-You can't know that.
-I believe it.

19:48.587 --> 19:52.392
I think we're gonna
get through this.

19:52.424 --> 19:56.194
I think I'm gonna live
a long and silly life,

19:56.229 --> 19:59.598
and I'm not interested in doing
that without you around.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.871
Oh. Okay.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.539
Okay?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.776
Yes.

20:09.808 --> 20:12.111
I mean, yes.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.549
-No.
-No.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.219
After.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.656
Give it to me when
the world doesn't end.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.401
What have
you got for me?
Some ideas.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.603
Well,
notions or...

20:36.635 --> 20:39.372
theories based on
wild speculation.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.575
Did I mention
I'm not good
under pressure?

20:42.608 --> 20:45.144
I need you, Wil.
You're my big gun.

20:45.176 --> 20:48.881
I'm your--
No, I was never a gun.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.750
Someone else should be the gun.
I-I could be a cudgel...

20:51.784 --> 20:53.519
or-or a pointy stick.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.056
You're the strongest
person here.

20:57.088 --> 21:00.826
-You know that, right?
-Well, no.

21:00.859 --> 21:04.262
Wil, you're
the only person that's
ever hurt Glory... at all.

21:04.297 --> 21:09.000
You're my best shot at getting
her on the ropes, so don't get
a jelly belly on me now.

21:09.035 --> 21:13.772
Well, I do sort of
have this one idea,

21:13.806 --> 21:16.174
but the last few days,

21:16.208 --> 21:19.412
I've mostly been
looking into ways
to help Tara.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.814
I know that shouldn't
be my priority.

21:23.148 --> 21:24.550
Of course it should.

21:26.385 --> 21:30.256
Well, I've been
charting their essences,
mapping out.

21:30.288 --> 21:33.692
I think...
If I can get close enough,

21:33.726 --> 21:35.827
I may be able
to reverse what Glory did,

21:35.862 --> 21:39.531
like take back
what she took from Tara.

21:39.566 --> 21:43.670
It might weaken Glory
or make her less coherent,

21:43.702 --> 21:45.837
or it might make
all our heads explode.

21:45.872 --> 21:46.838
GILES:
Buffy.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.376
I'll try to work it.

21:56.147 --> 21:59.050
Don't worry, love.
It won't be long.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.855
Bitch!
I'm supposed to work
on the factors!

22:06.659 --> 22:09.060
I'm not-- I'm not--

22:14.066 --> 22:16.001
I'm gonna bring you back.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.407
No. No, no,
that's good.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.476
That could be pivotal.
Thank you, guys.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.243
Um, well, then you're
gonna need some--

22:25.277 --> 22:26.712
Way ahead of you.
We have time?

22:26.746 --> 22:28.714
-Yes, if you hurry.
-Oh, okay.

22:28.748 --> 22:32.151
-I'll grab some weapons too.
-I'm looking for something
in a broadsword.

22:32.183 --> 22:35.253
-Don't be swinging
that thing near me.
-Hey, I happen to be--

22:35.287 --> 22:36.623
A glorified bricklayer?

22:39.025 --> 22:41.728
I'm also
a swell bowler.
Has his own shoes.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.564
The Gods themselves
do tremble.
Spike, shut your mouth.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.699
Come with me.

22:51.237 --> 22:54.039
The weapons
are in the chest by the TV.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.643
-I'll grab
the stuff upstairs.
-Uh, Buffy--

23:02.147 --> 23:05.284
If you wanna just hand them
over the threshold--

23:05.317 --> 23:07.086
Come in, Spike.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.462
Hm.

23:18.263 --> 23:21.099
Presto. No barrier.

23:22.934 --> 23:26.905
Um, we won't bother
with the small stuff.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.407
Couple of good axes should
hold off Glory's mates...

23:29.442 --> 23:31.242
while you take on
the lady yourself.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.214
We're not all gonna make it.
You know that.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.849
Yeah.

23:39.685 --> 23:43.388
Hey, I always knew
I'd go down fighting.

23:43.422 --> 23:47.159
I'm counting on you...
to protect her.

23:48.426 --> 23:49.862
Till the end
of the world.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.865
Even if that happens
to be tonight.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.136
-I'll be a minute.
-Yeah.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.009
I know
you never loved me.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.847
I know that I'm a monster.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.884
But you treat me
like a man, and that's--

24:15.887 --> 24:19.357
Get your stuff.
I'll be here.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.633
(wind whistling)

24:39.345 --> 24:41.513
She will come to you soon.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.993
We on schedule?

24:55.027 --> 24:56.494
(Giles grunts)

24:56.528 --> 24:58.064
Yes. It's time.

24:58.096 --> 24:59.766
Wil?

25:07.239 --> 25:10.076
Tara, baby.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.911
Is there somewhere
you should be?

25:13.913 --> 25:17.584
-They held me down.
-No one's holding you.

25:17.616 --> 25:21.353
It's the big day,
right?

25:21.386 --> 25:23.690
WILLOW:
Do you wanna go?

25:33.432 --> 25:36.367
You're a killer.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.403
This is all set down.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.209
Stay close
but don't crowd her.

25:43.241 --> 25:46.846
We'll follow in a minute.
Hey, everybody knows their jobs.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.816
Remember,
the ritual starts,
we all die.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.618
And I'll kill anyone
who comes near Dawn.

25:57.656 --> 26:01.794
Well, not exactly
the Saint Crispin's Day
speech, was it?

26:01.827 --> 26:03.962
"We few...

26:03.996 --> 26:06.833
we happy few--"
We band
of buggered.

26:43.368 --> 26:46.638
-Shpadoinkle.
-What is that?

26:46.673 --> 26:49.808
The portal
must open up there.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.309
BUFFY:
Wil, you're up.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.181
GILES: Need anything?

26:56.883 --> 26:59.652
Could use
a little courage.

26:59.685 --> 27:01.487
The real kind.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.289
But thanks.

27:25.144 --> 27:29.214
You,
what are you doing here?
She's with me.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.719
(Glory, Tara groaning)

27:42.528 --> 27:44.864
What the frickin' hell
did that bitch do to me?

27:46.164 --> 27:48.366
You look fine. Uh, truly.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.438
She made a little--
she made a hole.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.539
Oh, I need
a brain to eat.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.976
Oh, take mine,
O groove-tastic one.

27:57.009 --> 28:01.313
I said a brain,
you worthless dirt.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.851
Big day.
I got places to be.
Big day.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.854
Need a brain.
(chuckles)

28:07.886 --> 28:10.388
Suppose I could
always use yours.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.790
BUFFY: Okay then.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.028
Come and get it.

28:26.704 --> 28:28.406
You don't seem very well.

28:28.440 --> 28:32.845
Your little witch bitch gave me
kind of a headache there.

28:32.878 --> 28:36.182
But if you think
this is going to last
more than eight seconds--

28:36.214 --> 28:39.617
I noticed you're talking,
whereas in your position,
I would attack me.

28:39.651 --> 28:44.022
Oh, most sweaty,
naughty feelings-causing one,
should we--

28:44.056 --> 28:45.892
Go guard the girl.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.894
This is--
this is a, uh--

28:48.927 --> 28:51.763
-Diversionary tactic?
-Go guard!

28:57.568 --> 28:59.538
It's strange.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.874
You're not as blurry
with speed as usual, either.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.474
-The witch--
-It's not her.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.612
Might be this.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.615
I heard it's supposed
to repel you,

29:09.647 --> 29:13.152
so my guess is you probably
shouldn't touch it either.

29:18.156 --> 29:19.590
You're gonna wish you were--

29:25.163 --> 29:29.067
Stand fast! Kill anyone
who dares approach!

29:29.101 --> 29:32.337
This will be
our day of Glory!

29:32.371 --> 29:34.272
Well punned!
Well, it just
called out to me.

30:14.246 --> 30:17.816
-Tara?
-(grunting)

30:20.551 --> 30:21.854
Tara?

30:23.721 --> 30:25.423
Tara?

30:30.362 --> 30:32.097
Willow?

30:34.333 --> 30:37.002
-Tara?
-Willow,

30:37.036 --> 30:40.038
I got so lost.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.508
I found you.

30:45.877 --> 30:49.181
I will always find you.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.220
You know what?

30:54.252 --> 30:56.721
I'm feeling
a little better.

30:56.755 --> 30:58.723
And now
I'm a little bored.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.726
Oh, I'm sorry.
'Cause you're about--

31:04.730 --> 31:07.598
Wow.
The Slayer's
a robot.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.903
Did everybody else know
the Slayer was a robot?

31:10.936 --> 31:12.804
Glory?

31:17.808 --> 31:20.445
You're not the brightest God
in the heavens, are you?

31:20.546 --> 31:23.414
Buffy! I'm up here!

31:24.782 --> 31:26.451
Buffy!

31:36.295 --> 31:38.864
Oh, no, you don't.

31:38.896 --> 31:41.299
Buffy! I'm up here!

32:11.430 --> 32:12.631
Buffy!

32:39.157 --> 32:40.858
(grunts)

32:55.473 --> 32:56.942
Uh!

32:56.974 --> 32:58.876
-Uh!
-(yells)

33:09.820 --> 33:12.023
You lost your hammer,
sweet cheeks.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.724
What are you
gonna hit me with now?

33:16.528 --> 33:19.030
(groaning)

33:19.065 --> 33:21.833
Whatever's handy.

33:24.935 --> 33:28.273
And the glorified bricklayer
picks up a spare.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.079
Has anyone noticed that
we're going backwards?

33:34.113 --> 33:36.182
It's crossed my mind.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.251
As long as Buffy
can keep Glory down

33:40.286 --> 33:42.421
long enough,
it doesn't matter.

33:42.453 --> 33:44.522
There's only a few minutes left
to start the ritual.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.596
(gasps)

33:52.263 --> 33:55.101
You. You can help me.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.336
DAWN: Untie me.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.872
Please.
Help me. She's coming.

34:00.905 --> 34:04.009
Well, it seems
she's running

34:04.041 --> 34:06.944
a bit late,
is the thing.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.547
And, uh,
if Her Splendidness

34:09.581 --> 34:12.217
can't be here
in time to bleed you--

34:12.251 --> 34:16.121
(whispering) Hey, kid.
Wanna see a trick?

34:18.989 --> 34:20.458
(gasps)

34:33.172 --> 34:35.806
How we doing?
So far, it's a tie.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.844
We haven't got up
to Dawn, but then
neither has anyone else.

34:40.077 --> 34:41.612
Someone's up there.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.452
Okay, we gotta charge
or something.
We tried that.

34:47.485 --> 34:51.123
WILLOW (through Telepathy):
 Spike, can you hear me?

34:51.157 --> 34:53.925
-Yeah. Loud and clear.
- Is there someone up there
 with Dawn?

34:53.958 --> 34:56.827
Yeah. Can't tell who.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.664
-Are you talking to us?
 -Get up there. Go now.

35:02.032 --> 35:04.369
-Yeah, but--
 - (echoey) Go!

35:06.637 --> 35:08.005
-Ah!
-Get back!

35:12.443 --> 35:15.347
Well,
what do you know?

35:15.380 --> 35:19.083
It's just about
that time.
Spike!

35:19.117 --> 35:22.288
Doesn't a fella stay dead
when you kill him?

35:22.320 --> 35:25.090
Look who's talking.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.360
Come on, Doc.
Let's you and me
have a go.

35:28.393 --> 35:32.963
I... do have
a prior appointment.

35:32.998 --> 35:36.967
-This won't take long.
-No. I don't imagine it will.

35:38.369 --> 35:40.306
-(groans)
-(gasps)

35:45.177 --> 35:49.380
You're just a mortal.
You couldn't understand
my pain.

35:49.414 --> 35:52.217
Then I'll just have to settle
for causing it.

35:52.251 --> 35:56.387
(groans) You can't kill me.

35:56.422 --> 35:59.324
No. But my arm's
not even tired yet.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.396
You don't come near
the girl, Doc.

36:05.563 --> 36:08.166
I don't smell a soul
anywhere on you.

36:08.199 --> 36:11.637
-Why do you even care?
-I made a promise to a lady.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.438
Oh?

36:16.106 --> 36:17.376
-(grunting)
-(gasps)

36:18.876 --> 36:21.280
Well, I'll send
the lady your regrets.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.184
No. (yells)

36:26.217 --> 36:28.920
-(Dawn screams)
-No!

36:34.726 --> 36:38.195
-Stop it.
-You're a God.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.367
-(yells)
-Make it stop.

36:51.443 --> 36:54.880
-(gulps)
-(inhales)

36:54.913 --> 36:58.284
I'm sorry.

36:58.317 --> 37:02.521
Tell her it's over.
She missed her shot.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.123
She goes.

37:05.155 --> 37:08.793
She ever, ever comes
near me and mine again--

37:08.827 --> 37:11.896
We won't. I swear.

37:11.929 --> 37:15.300
-(hammer clanks)
-(coughs)

37:17.635 --> 37:19.737
I guess we're stuck
with each other, huh, baby?

37:27.012 --> 37:29.815
Can you move?

37:29.847 --> 37:34.152
Need a-- a minute.

37:34.184 --> 37:35.987
She could've killed me.

37:36.021 --> 37:40.326
No, she couldn't. Never.

37:40.358 --> 37:42.661
And sooner or later,
glory will reemerge

37:42.693 --> 37:46.164
and make Buffy
pay for that mercy.

37:46.197 --> 37:49.134
And the world with her.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.737
Buffy even knows that,

37:51.769 --> 37:53.771
and still she couldn't
take a human life.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.777
She's a hero, you see.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.347
She's not like us.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.782
Us?

38:06.518 --> 38:09.054
(muffled moans)

38:14.525 --> 38:17.695
(groans, struggling stops)

38:19.130 --> 38:20.865
(agonized cries)

38:20.898 --> 38:24.335
-Shallow cuts.
-(whimpering)

38:24.369 --> 38:27.773
Shallow cuts.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.809
-(agonized cry)
-Let the blood flow...

38:30.842 --> 38:33.043
free.

38:33.077 --> 38:35.681
BUFFY:
Dawn.
Buffy!

38:36.981 --> 38:38.684
This should
be interesting.

38:38.717 --> 38:39.885
(screams)

38:39.918 --> 38:41.387
Come here.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.253
Buffy, it hurts.

38:45.391 --> 38:48.793
BUFFY:
I got it. Come here.
You're gonna be...

38:48.827 --> 38:50.528
Okay.

38:54.432 --> 38:58.202
-Go!
-Buffy, it's started.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.344
MAN:
Watch out! Fire!

39:12.884 --> 39:16.253
(creatures screeching)

39:34.105 --> 39:35.407
Xander!

39:40.077 --> 39:41.311
Anya!

39:47.918 --> 39:49.987
-I'm sorry.
-It doesn't matter.

39:51.121 --> 39:52.423
What are you doing?

39:54.224 --> 39:58.195
I have to jump.
The energy--
It'll kill you.

39:58.228 --> 40:00.831
I know.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.402
Buffy, I know
about the ritual.

40:04.436 --> 40:06.605
I have to stop it.

40:06.637 --> 40:07.905
No.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.677
I have to.
Look at what's happening.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.447
(bellowing)

40:19.818 --> 40:22.721
Buffy,
you have to let me go.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.724
Blood starts it,
and until the blood
stops flowing,

40:25.757 --> 40:26.858
it'll never stop.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.195
You know
you have to let me.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.668
It has
to have the blood.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.806
'Cause it's always
got to be blood.

40:41.840 --> 40:46.744
BUFFY:
it's Summers' blood.
It's just like mine. She's me.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.780
The monks made her out of me.

40:48.813 --> 40:50.516
Death is your gift.

40:50.548 --> 40:53.652
-Death--
-... is your gift.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.974
Buffy, no.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.976
Dawnie, I have to.

41:18.009 --> 41:20.110
No!
Listen to me.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.012
Please, there's not
a lot of time. Listen.

41:22.047 --> 41:25.717
(no audible dialogue)

42:11.295 --> 42:13.931
BUFFY:
 Dawn, listen to me. Listen.

42:15.701 --> 42:19.704
I love you.
 I will always love you.

42:19.737 --> 42:22.608
This is the work
 that I have to do.

42:37.422 --> 42:39.090
BUFFY:
 Tell Giles that--

42:40.626 --> 42:42.860
Tell Giles I figured it out,

42:42.893 --> 42:46.563
and-- and I'm okay.

42:55.139 --> 42:58.809
And give my love to my friends.

42:58.844 --> 43:00.311
You have to take care
 of them now.

43:02.748 --> 43:04.782
You have to take care
 of each other.

43:06.617 --> 43:08.018
You have to be strong.

43:10.755 --> 43:14.925
Dawn, the hardest thing
 in this world is to live in it.

43:18.195 --> 43:21.365
Be brave. Live...

43:23.101 --> 43:24.802
for me.

44:24.896 --> 44:26.530
Grr! Arrgh!
