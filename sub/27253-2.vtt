01:21.840 --> 01:23.200
There are survivors over here.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.960
-How long have these men been here?
-Since last week.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.880
And more keep coming every day.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.760
We can provide shelter,
but this mill must keep spinning.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.560
There's no wool to spin.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.280
The English ships won't deliver,
not as long as the war drags on.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.240
Our obligations cannot be met
without revenue.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.920
We can't even send
the Pope's tithes to Rome.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.880
The people are desperate.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.680
This war must end.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.880
Albizzi is outmatched.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.640
If the war ends now,
it will mean defeat for Florence.

01:55.720 --> 01:59.000
If it doesn't end now, we shall be ruined.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.960
--Madonna...

02:02.040 --> 02:04.160
-What's going on?
-There are men at the door.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.760
-Where are the guards?
-Showing the mercenaries.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.600
-Shall I find Messer Cosimo?
-No, I'll deal with this.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.280
- Get out of the way!

02:17.360 --> 02:18.600
How may I help you, Messer?

02:18.680 --> 02:20.720
We have come to search the house,
Madonna! Step aside!

02:20.800 --> 02:22.000
Search? Whatever for?

02:22.080 --> 02:24.200
There's no work to be found
and we're hungry!

02:24.880 --> 02:26.120
Go to the kitchen!

02:26.200 --> 02:29.800
-Have the cook bring these men some food.
-It's not food we're looking for!

02:31.680 --> 02:34.640
This is not a bank.
If you want gold, go there.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.200
There are guards at the bank!

02:36.280 --> 02:39.400
Move aside, Madonna.
We don't want to hurt you.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.240
Wouldn't it be simpler to just ask me
where the gold is to be found?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.040
If you please.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.880
At the mint.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.920
-The mint?
-There are 54 grains of gold in a florin.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.800
The last of ours are being used
to strike new coins as we speak.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.800
You're de Girolamo, aren't you not?
The weaver.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.240
And you're del Giudice, the mason.

03:22.200 --> 03:26.120
If you ransack this house, rest assured
the Gonfaloniere will hear of it.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.320
Do you really want to face prison
for a pointless search?

03:33.520 --> 03:36.360
Wait outside, Messer.
The cook will bring you food.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.840
What good fortune
that the gold is at the mint.

03:41.920 --> 03:42.920
Of course it isn't.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.240
That door is to remain locked
until you find Marco Bello.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.280
Tell him we need guards.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.320
What are you thinking?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.360
I come from the front.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.680
Where my son Ormanno fights valiantly.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.800
Not to deliver fantasies of easy victory.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.120
But the hard facts of war.

04:30.200 --> 04:35.320
Written with blood and steel!
We are sworn to defeat the Milanese!

04:35.400 --> 04:40.640
But this, condottiero, Sforza,
has killed and maimed many of our men.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.640
To defeat him...

04:44.440 --> 04:45.920
We need greater resources.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.680
We have no more money to fund your wars!

04:48.760 --> 04:51.560
-You cannot draw blood from a stone!
-Yes!

04:51.640 --> 04:53.560
I understand your hardship, Messer.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.640
But our republic cannot afford to lose!

04:58.760 --> 05:02.240
- Not after we have invested so much.
- Signor Guadagni!

05:03.640 --> 05:07.160
-Signor Pazzi...
-We agree with Signor Albizzi.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.760
We demand a vote!

05:08.840 --> 05:10.360
--A vote!

05:10.440 --> 05:14.280
- Yes! Yes!
- A vote! A vote!

05:14.360 --> 05:15.360
We agree!

05:17.120 --> 05:18.160
Good!

05:19.040 --> 05:23.600
Then let's move to the vote.
Black for yes, white for no.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.160
Our supporters are waiting
for you to lead, Cosimo.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.880
This war bleeds us dry.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.800
-Oppose Albizzi.
-Is that what you would do?

05:41.880 --> 05:44.320
-If Father had asked you to lead the bank?
-Why won't you?

05:45.880 --> 05:49.480
I can see what Albizzi does not
when the price of victory is too high.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.160
So you just accept defeat?

05:55.760 --> 05:57.240
I act when I can act.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.360
The vote for more taxes...

06:59.280 --> 07:03.000
- is past!

07:46.320 --> 07:48.120
What are you doing here?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.560
Are you deaf? Answer me.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.960
-Praying.
-Enough of that. Come with me.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.320
When will you complete it, Father?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.480
-Complete what?
-The cathedral.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.480
I told you to put away your drawings.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.880
You will lead the life of a banker,
not an artist.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.240
I have put them away.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.760
But the church cannot be consecrated
until it has a dome.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.680
I will not live to see it consecrated,
neither will you.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.760
Someone must be clever enough
to complete it.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.440
The problem is not the engineering.
It's capital.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.800
Well, surely we can afford it now.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.600
With the Pope's revenues
flowing through the bank.

08:37.680 --> 08:40.400
Think, Cosimo.
Why was the cathedral built?

08:40.480 --> 08:41.920
-To honor God.
-Yes.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.880
And you honor God by serving
this family, and our bank.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.360
-I don't see how a bank honors God.
-Men are God's creation.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.880
- Whatever we achieve is God's glory.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.600
-We're late.
-What for?

08:57.360 --> 08:59.280
We're going home
to meet your father-in-law.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.480
Some wine, Messer Bardi?

09:05.760 --> 09:07.200
No.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.920
My father will be with us at any moment.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.840
I'm not accustomed to being made to wait,
Messer Medici.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.520
Yes. No disrespect is intended,
I assure you...

09:17.840 --> 09:21.360
I see you have already met my son
Lorenzo, Monsieur Bardi.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.480
-This is Cosimo.
-It is an honor.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.160
Shall we get down to business,
Messer Medici?

09:33.720 --> 09:34.920
Back this way.

09:42.280 --> 09:47.960
My father and grandfather were bankers
who could afford to buy noble blood...

09:48.920 --> 09:51.040
Just as you do now.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.840
I am aware, Messer.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.360
Centuries of prosperity ruined

09:56.440 --> 09:59.800
by a single unpaid loan
to the King of England.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.600
And now I find myself forced
to sell my daughter's hand.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.600
Your noble blood

10:06.680 --> 10:09.320
is an asset whose value
cannot be diminished.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.960
Beware, Messer Medici.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.600
It's difficult to scale
the heights of power.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.240
The fall is swift and easy.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.280
-You are a wise man, Messer.
-A humbled one.

10:22.040 --> 10:26.320
As we are both men of business,
shall we speak terms?

10:26.920 --> 10:28.760
- Please.
- Romantic, isn't it?

10:28.840 --> 10:34.120
The loan that ruined my family
was for 900,000 florins.

10:34.200 --> 10:39.320
For my daughter's hand, I ask 100,000.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.240
Oh!

10:41.720 --> 10:42.720
Pardon me.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.400
I appreciate your position, Messer,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.680
but that is far more
than this union is worth.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.920
In that case,
there is no union to be made.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.200
Your daughter is attractive,
but opinionated.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.880
She has very few suitors,

11:01.960 --> 11:04.400
none with the means
to support your family.

11:04.480 --> 11:08.680
You need to marry her off, Messer.
And at a good price.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.760
I am prepared to offer 50,000 florins.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.320
That will not do.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.640
You will not do better.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.840
You miscalculate, Messer Medici,

11:17.920 --> 11:22.240
50,000 florins can scarcely improve
my family's position.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.480
Not by itself, perhaps, but...

11:25.080 --> 11:29.840
your bank holds bills of trade
with merchants in Barcelona,

11:29.920 --> 11:32.520
Seville, and Marseille.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.920
Bills of trade as yet unpaid.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.520
My bank is prepared
to acquire these bills,

11:37.600 --> 11:40.200
at one-third their face value.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.480
All told, that would result
in a net dowry of, uh...

11:43.560 --> 11:47.280
81,473 florins.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.560
Mm.

11:54.960 --> 11:59.240
You calculate the conflict
in Avignon will end

11:59.320 --> 12:03.640
and these bills of trade
will become payable.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.320
Sooner or later.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.040
In which case, rather than

12:07.840 --> 12:12.360
paying for my daughter's hand,
you would actually profit from it.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.880
My family can afford to wait
to pay these debts, Messer.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.280
Yours cannot.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.600
Very well... I agree to the terms.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.320
And you, young man,
you shall have my daughter as a bride.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.880
We are delighted to welcome her
into our family.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.480
She's looking forward to meeting you.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.800
Medici!

13:09.920 --> 13:11.920
I must get back to the front.

13:12.760 --> 13:17.440
But I am not ungrateful for your support,
however belated.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.040
I had no choice.
The people of Florence are suffering.

13:21.120 --> 13:26.400
It's not just the people who suffer,
but your bank, which is starved of trade.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.320
Do you have a question, Rinaldo?

13:29.400 --> 13:33.760
I understand the surgeon,
di Cecco, is dead. Murdered.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.320
-So I have been told.
-Curious.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.920
I saw you talking to him
inside the cathedral.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.080
Only a few days before he died.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.600
We are making inquiries.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.680
Good.

13:49.880 --> 13:54.520
I should be most eager to find out
who killed him. And why.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.000
Why does he speak like that?

14:00.120 --> 14:01.720
He cannot suspect you.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.800
It is not only the Milanese
he seeks to destroy.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.160
Come.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.640
I was just going to get you.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.760
- What is it?
- Your wife.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.320
Darling, are you unwell?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.680
-I'm perfectly fine.
-She's not fine.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.040
-She fell.
-When?

14:32.120 --> 14:35.080
-An hour ago.
-I stood up too quickly, that's all.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.360
After drinking a cup of wine,
she said it tasted off.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.040
It was fine. I'm fine.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.400
Will everyone please stop fussing over me?

14:43.480 --> 14:45.360
You're pale as a ghost.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.960
This is my fault, for worrying you
with talk of going to war.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.120
Nonsense.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.520
She just needs a little rest.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.760
-That's all.
-Thank you.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.920
Do you think she's been poisoned?

15:00.000 --> 15:03.440
-I'm not certain, of course.
-How? In my home!

15:04.720 --> 15:08.680
Well, it wouldn't be too difficult
to uncork a bottle from the vineyard.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.680
-I want all our wine disposed of.
-I have already given the order.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.960
Go to the apothecary. Seek an antidote.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.160
At once.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.840
What is it, Cosimo?

15:23.040 --> 15:24.040
Business.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.200
What kind of business?

15:27.480 --> 15:29.280
Let me tend to these affairs.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.720
You take care of this family.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.040
I always have!

15:37.120 --> 15:38.640
And more besides.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.520
- Is he handsome?
- I couldn't say.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.880
Well, did he seem kind? Clever?

15:49.960 --> 15:51.360
I've been told he's a cold fish.

15:51.440 --> 15:55.320
I didn't notice,
and you must stop asking questions.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.720
Father, this man is to be my husband.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.200
Do you take so little interest
in my happiness?

16:00.280 --> 16:01.840
This is not about your happiness.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.000
-Obviously.
-Contessina!

16:04.080 --> 16:07.520
-Your tongue is too sharp!
-So I'm told.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.440
You've been given the chance
to save your family from ruin.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.960
By marrying beneath me.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.480
That is the way all my friends
will see it.

16:15.560 --> 16:19.360
In that case,
they are not worthy of your friendship.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.640
Father, there are others
who would have my hand.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.760
You mean, Ezio Contarini?

16:25.840 --> 16:28.760
He may have a title,
but he has no resources.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.680
He has declared his love for me,
and I care for him.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.320
Daughter, do you know how naive you sound?

16:36.400 --> 16:41.960
When you marry into the Medici,
we will gain 80,000 florins,

16:42.040 --> 16:46.000
and you will be my eyes and ears
on what is now the richest bank on earth.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.360
Your bride's arrived, Cosimo.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.720
-What are you doing?
-I have no use for them.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.160
Now that I am to lead the life
of a banker.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.560
Brother, you were always
to lead the life of a banker.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.920
The one that you wanted us
to meet in Rome...

17:23.000 --> 17:26.160
-That doesn't matter.
-Who was she?

17:27.640 --> 17:30.400
Bianca. A true woman.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.680
But not suitable for a Medici,
so Father got rid of her.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.360
Well, whatever Father may have done,

17:35.440 --> 17:38.240
Contessina de Bardi
is to be your now bride, Cosimo.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.640
-You must accept that.
-More bad to do good.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.800
Marrying into nobility is not bad.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.920
And, uh, who knows,
in time your affections may grow.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.440
Advises the man who's yet to fall in love
with a woman?

17:50.520 --> 17:53.360
Come.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.840
They're waiting.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.560
Oh, yes, I do.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.920
Contessina de' Bardi, Cosimo de' Medici.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.200
Contessina...

18:40.840 --> 18:43.240
My son is delighted to meet you.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.320
You two should get acquainted.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.040
Are you quite well, Messer de' Medici?

19:06.120 --> 19:08.840
You may call me Cosimo
if we are to be married.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.320
Thank you, Cosimo.
You've not answered my question.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.200
I think you know
I am quite well, Contessina.

19:14.280 --> 19:18.120
-Then you are uncomfortable.
-And you are as direct as I've been told.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.320
I know you did not choose
this union, Cosimo--

19:20.400 --> 19:21.480
I did not.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.800
I do not appreciate being
mated like cattle.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.960
-Cattle?
-I'm sorry if the truth offends you.

19:28.040 --> 19:31.520
-I did not choose this union either.
-Then why go through with it?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.680
Because it benefits my family, of course.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.240
From the moment we are married,
you will be a Medici.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.440
You will not act as an agent
for your father's bank,

19:50.520 --> 19:51.640
telling him our family's secrets.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.040
You will be my wife,

19:54.120 --> 19:56.840
and you will be loyal to me,
and only to me.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.760
Do you understand?

20:43.680 --> 20:45.200
What can I help you with, mastro?

20:45.280 --> 20:47.400
Are you familiar
with the properties of hemlock?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.160
Yes, of course.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.600
My friend may have
accidentally ingested some.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.560
That is quite an accident.
Is your friend still alive?

20:55.640 --> 20:57.440
-I seek an antidote.
-When was it consumed?

20:57.520 --> 20:59.400
Just a few hours ago.

21:00.800 --> 21:05.000
I'm sorry, mastro.
The only antidote is an emetic.

21:05.080 --> 21:09.080
Zinc or mustard and castor oil,
but it's too late for that.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.840
Keep your friend warm. And pray.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.080
That is his only hope.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.680
-You sell hemlock here, don't you?
-Yes.

21:25.760 --> 21:29.080
It is needed from time to time
to put down a sick animal.

21:30.160 --> 21:34.160
-And do you sell it as a liquid?
-As a liquid?

21:34.240 --> 21:37.680
One that could be used,
say, to paint grapes.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.200
Grapes? No.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.400
I don't prepare liquid hemlock, mastro.

21:56.800 --> 22:00.600
Trade in or out of Florence
has virtually dried up.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.400
This cursed war
is destroying the bank.

22:04.760 --> 22:05.760
Well?

22:06.280 --> 22:09.360
The apothecary says
it is too late for an antidote.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.560
Am I simply to watch and wait
as my daughter-in-law dies?

22:15.240 --> 22:16.680
May we have a moment?

22:17.720 --> 22:20.440
Of course. I'll collect the accounts
from the other room.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.920
We don't know how much she ingested.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.800
We are not even certain
that it was hemlock.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.000
But the apothecary does sell
such a poison.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.600
He could have sold the hemlock
used to kill your father.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.400
Surely he would never admit
to such a crime.

22:41.480 --> 22:44.520
No. Not freely.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.600
You are not to hurt this man, Marco.

22:47.680 --> 22:51.120
You need proof Rinaldo degli Albizzi
killed your father.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.560
-The apothecary could supply it.
-But the surgeon was enough.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.120
I'll not have any more blood on my hands.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.160
The blood is on my hands, Cosimo,
not yours.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.200
Once a thing gets started,
it must be finished.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.200
God knows that is enough.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.360
And Albizzi suspects.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.440
-He can never prove it.
-A viper cornered may strike anyone.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.200
-He's already struck my daughter-in-law--
-Then we need the truth.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.320
How is she?

23:37.480 --> 23:39.480
No better, no worse.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.440
-Ah, good morning.
-Ugo...

24:18.760 --> 24:22.880
-What are you doing here?
-Your wife is in need of funds.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.720
So I've been, uh, scraping together
florins from different accounts.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.000
Florence has ground to a halt
under the weight of this war,

24:31.080 --> 24:34.120
and there will be no hope of recovery
until peace is restored.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.440
When was the last time
tithes were paid to the Pope?

24:36.520 --> 24:39.440
Six weeks ago, I believe.
Since before the war began.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.280
-How much are we holding?
-A great deal.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.920
Almost, uh, 70,000 florins.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.640
More than enough.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.160
All those funds belong to the Pope.
We cannot touch them.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.880
Thank you, Ugo.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.640
What are you thinking?

25:01.160 --> 25:04.640
Opportunities may arise
in the most unlikely of circumstances.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.120
Messere...

26:49.960 --> 26:52.640
Those men? Who were they?

26:53.960 --> 26:55.880
It doesn't concern you.

26:55.960 --> 26:59.280
Any strangers in my home
at this moment concerns me.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.400
I'm looking for her.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.800
Rosa?

27:09.760 --> 27:11.920
I can't get her out of my mind, Cosimo.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.040
I loved her.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.880
I don't care what anyone says.
She wouldn't just disappear.

27:24.200 --> 27:28.080
-It has been months, Lorenzo.
-So you're telling me just to give up?

27:28.840 --> 27:32.120
Like you did with that girl that you loved
all those years ago?

27:33.800 --> 27:36.120
I would never presume
to tell you what to do.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.560
What is it you want, brother?

27:42.640 --> 27:46.560
If I am to act against Albizzi,
I need allies.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.280
-What kind of allies?
-A kind one finds in Rome.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.600
What would you have the Pope do?

27:55.680 --> 27:57.920
I want you to prevail on him
to sue for peace.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.920
I don't see why Albizzi
would listen to the Pope.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.960
Albizzi is a man of faith,
and the Pope has certain...

28:05.880 --> 28:07.640
spiritual tools at his disposal.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.240
If you want to end this war,
then you must fight Albizzi head on.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.160
You know what Father taught us.

28:14.240 --> 28:19.480
Yes, but, surely desperate times
justify a direct exercise of power.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.520
If peace were to be restored,
people would soon forget

28:21.600 --> 28:23.040
the suffering they endured in this war,

28:23.120 --> 28:26.960
but would long remember I advocated
for surrender, and hate me for it.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.920
Is it not better they thank the Pope
than blame our bank?

28:44.040 --> 28:47.320
Our great cathedral
was begun generations ago

28:47.400 --> 28:50.360
by our grandfathers
and their fathers before them.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.520
And some say they dreamt too large.

28:54.600 --> 28:58.200
That their ambition
outstrips our abilities.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.800
But you, signore, are here today

29:02.520 --> 29:05.960
to complete the great work
that began so long ago.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.440
Why has no one solved
the mystery of the dome?

29:09.520 --> 29:12.040
It requires a great understanding
of mathematics.

29:12.120 --> 29:15.400
The weight alone
would cause the entire structure

29:15.480 --> 29:19.040
to come crashing down
onto the parishioners below.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.880
No scaffolding could possibly
be erected high enough.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.520
So how do I propose
to complete the great Duomo?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.840
We'll erect an enormous pillar...

29:26.920 --> 29:31.080
A giant mountain!
Dirt, mixed with coins, upon which...

29:31.160 --> 29:34.240
- The roof, of course...

29:36.480 --> 29:38.520
With all due respect
to my colleagues...

29:38.600 --> 29:40.800
-It is unquestionably...
-...without doubt...

29:40.880 --> 29:42.320
-...the only way.
-The only solution.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.880
- The only way.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.680
Fools!

29:46.760 --> 29:50.680
Charlatans. And impostors!

29:51.520 --> 29:53.960
None of you is fit
to call yourself an architect.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.800
Messer Medici, apologies.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.440
But I would not have come,
had I known this man was invited.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.960
I was not invited, but I came anyway.

30:01.040 --> 30:05.800
Because not one of you knows
how to complete this glorious edifice.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.240
Filippo Brunelleschi, at your service.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.400
The doors you designed for the baptistery
are of incomparable beauty.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.240
- Oh.
- That was 20 years ago.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.080
It was Ghiberti
who won the commission.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.640
And this man's a goldsmith,
he's not an architect.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.040
He is just a buffoon, a babbler.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.720
I'm a genius, ahead of my time.

30:27.480 --> 30:31.360
How do you propose to complete the dome,
Mastro Brunelleschi?

30:31.440 --> 30:33.240
The answer is quite simple.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.880
And it requires no pillars,
no sponge-stone,

30:35.960 --> 30:38.560
and no mountain of dirt and coins.

30:41.560 --> 30:46.160
- The artist sees what nature hides.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.840
The question you were asked
is how, "genius."

30:49.920 --> 30:54.400
I heard the question.
And here's the answer.

31:11.280 --> 31:15.160
Your presentation was dramatic,
mastro, but short on detail.

31:17.160 --> 31:21.000
You expect me to share my secrets
with those scoundrels?

31:21.760 --> 31:26.080
They would only steal my genius,
and claim it as their own.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.920
Surely you can explain to me how
you propose to complete the dome,

31:29.000 --> 31:32.720
since I am the man
who means to pay for it.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.800
Hmm.

31:35.280 --> 31:39.760
-You ever been to Rome?
-Yes. Many years ago.

31:39.840 --> 31:43.680
Then perhaps you observed
the sublime beauty of the pantheon,

31:43.760 --> 31:47.640
built so many centuries ago
by the ancients.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.360
I did indeed.

31:57.440 --> 32:03.120
I spend countless hours contemplating it,
studying it from all angles.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.840
I determined the only way
to complete our cathedral

32:07.520 --> 32:09.920
is to do it without scaffolding.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.360
In the air.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.840
-How?
-By building not one...

32:23.520 --> 32:24.520
but two domes.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.680
The inner dome will serve as support
for the outer dome.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.480
Ingenious.

32:31.560 --> 32:35.480
The first 46 feet
will be constructed in stone.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.680
Then we will use lighter materials,

32:38.760 --> 32:43.440
either brick or spugna,
laid in a herringbone pattern.

32:43.520 --> 32:47.360
So each brick supports the other.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.960
A flying buttress
imbedded in the dome itself.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.280
Precisely.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.960
-How do you know it will hold?
-I don't.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.760
No one can say for sure,

32:58.840 --> 33:02.960
because no one has ever attempted
to build a structure of this scale.

33:04.320 --> 33:08.120
If you fund me,
it will be an act of faith.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.640
It's been a long time
since the Medici have come to Rome.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.880
What is this urgent business of yours?

33:53.800 --> 33:56.080
As you're aware, Your Holiness,

33:56.160 --> 33:59.600
Florence is locked
in a ruinous war with Milan.

33:59.680 --> 34:04.600
I am. That's why your bank
has held back our tithes from the north.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.360
It wasn't safe to transport them.

34:10.520 --> 34:14.120
The people of Florence are suffering.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.320
What can I do?

34:21.320 --> 34:25.720
Persuade Rinaldo degli Albizzi
to sue the Duke of Milan for peace.

34:28.720 --> 34:31.280
I could write a letter for you
to carry back.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.400
Thank you, Your Holiness.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.320
But I'm afraid that I will need
more than a letter.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.600
There must be consequences
if Albizzi fails to heed your suasion.

34:40.680 --> 34:43.920
-Such as?
-Your Holiness...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.240
has many tools at his disposal.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.840
Spiritual tools.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.880
How is your wife, Piero?

35:00.840 --> 35:02.720
Sleeping. But no better.

35:09.760 --> 35:12.880
The messenger reached you
with news of the Pope's rejection?

35:12.960 --> 35:15.600
-Yes.
-Pius fool.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.040
- Son, are you not eating?
- No, I, uh..

35:19.120 --> 35:21.320
stopped at an inn
just outside Siena, where...

35:22.280 --> 35:23.880
I heard the most remarkable rumor.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.080
-What sort of rumor?
-I heard that my...

35:28.160 --> 35:30.760
brother intends to complete the dome
in the cathedral.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.400
Is this true?

35:34.480 --> 35:35.960
No, it couldn't possibly be, Mother.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.360
Even if someone were capable
of completing such a dome,

35:39.440 --> 35:45.000
which no one is, it would take years,
and cost hundreds of thousands of florins.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.880
Not even in the best of times
did Father dare such an undertaking.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.480
Cosimo, is it true?

35:51.040 --> 35:52.520
-Of course it is.
-Explain yourself.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.960
We've known
that he wanted to be an artist.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.480
Although he's picking a very odd time
to fulfill his childhood dreams--

35:58.560 --> 36:00.480
Cosimo, we barely have enough money
to feed ourselves.

36:00.560 --> 36:04.120
The men of Florence are poor. Hungry.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.800
They grow restless and resentful.
And two of them came to our home

36:07.880 --> 36:10.560
only days ago seeking to rob us
of our gold, did they not?

36:11.760 --> 36:14.120
The dome will put hundreds into work.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.520
Paid by imaginary wages?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.840
And hundreds more
providing bricks and supplies.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.680
They in turn will buy clothes, food
and the thousand other services

36:22.760 --> 36:24.880
on which the citizens rely on
for a livelihood.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.320
You're making work.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.680
- Out of nothing.
- Not out of nothing, son, no.

36:30.760 --> 36:31.760
The Pope may refuse to end this war,

36:31.840 --> 36:34.560
but his tithes will be used
for a spiritual purpose.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.600
Until we can repay him.

36:36.680 --> 36:40.240
You sent me to Rome,
knowing he would turn down my entreaty.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.160
And give you more time to use his funds.

36:43.240 --> 36:47.280
The people will be grateful,
not to the Albizzi for waging war,

36:47.360 --> 36:49.600
but to the Medici
for feeding their families.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.120
I wish I shared your optimism, Contessina.

36:52.200 --> 36:56.960
But while these lovely new jobs
drain our accounts,

36:57.640 --> 36:59.240
their taxes fund Albizzi's war.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.120
And as long as that continues,
we're all doomed.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.280
Welcome, everyone!

37:18.360 --> 37:20.800
All the builders, carpenters,
see the clerk here!

37:20.880 --> 37:23.520
All ladies go to the gentleman in black.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.960
-What's your trade, sir?
-Apples.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.840
--Medici?

37:27.840 --> 37:29.240
What's going on here?

37:29.320 --> 37:31.120
You have been too long at the battlefield.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.240
My brother has decided
to complete the dome.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.920
Complete it? Now?

37:37.000 --> 37:40.880
While you wreak destruction
outside of the city walls,

37:40.960 --> 37:42.920
the Medici create within.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.240
- Next!
- Keep moving! Up the hill!

37:50.160 --> 37:53.960
Don't be concerned, son.
This folly will only hasten their demise.

37:54.040 --> 37:57.000
If you're already assigned
a position, please move on! Thank you!

37:57.080 --> 37:59.400
The bill of sale, Mastro Tancredi.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.840
-What bill of sale?
-For the hemlock I know you sold.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.520
I need the name of your customer,
and proof that he bought it.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.960
I don't have it.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.360
Find it.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.840
Or loose the other eye.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.640
I'll be back tonight!

39:04.960 --> 39:10.080
...Matrimonium coniunctio

39:10.640 --> 39:13.760
In nomine Patris

39:13.840 --> 39:19.360
Et Filii et Spiritus Sancti

39:42.480 --> 39:43.600
Whoop!

39:46.840 --> 39:48.320
Are you always so quiet?

39:49.880 --> 39:51.400
What if I am?

39:52.760 --> 39:54.200
I am not.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.560
Then that is something we will both have
to get used to, Contessina.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.480
Excuse me.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.840
Give my son time.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.120
Time for what?

40:25.200 --> 40:28.560
To recover. He's still smarting
from a failed affair in Rome.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.680
Was he in love?

40:34.960 --> 40:36.720
Perhaps he thought he was.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.080
It was simply a laundress
who caught his eye.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.640
-Who ended the affair? He or she?
-Neither.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.800
I told his father to intervene.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.400
For Cosimo's own good.

41:04.400 --> 41:05.400
What's the matter?

41:06.560 --> 41:08.440
You need to ask?

41:08.520 --> 41:11.360
You are to lead the most powerful bank
in all of Europe,

41:11.440 --> 41:15.280
and have married into a noble family.

41:15.360 --> 41:19.120
I don't see, uh, much you have
to be upset about.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.680
-You had no right.
-I had no right?

41:22.760 --> 41:26.080
-You sent her away!
-Of course I did.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.320
Father...

41:41.320 --> 41:45.840
-this is my life to lead.
-No, no, it is not. I gave you life.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.760
And I will instruct you
on what you do with it.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.520
-I wanted to be an artist.
-An artist?

41:52.600 --> 41:55.760
Your folly was made possible
because of the privilege I gave you.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.960
To what end?

41:58.400 --> 42:01.560
You give me an education,
you expose me to great beauty,

42:02.600 --> 42:06.280
then insist I spend my life
devoted to money and politics.

42:07.320 --> 42:10.680
money and politics

42:10.760 --> 42:13.920
are what make possible
the beauty that you so worship.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.640
I didn't climb out of the stink
and mud of that mill,

42:17.720 --> 42:22.480
and scrounge the capital
to start this bank and raise this family,

42:22.560 --> 42:26.920
all, so you could just throw it away
on, on, on youthful passions.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.440
Think with your brain.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.760
A man must live his own life.

42:38.960 --> 42:39.960
Well...

42:41.320 --> 42:43.480
a foolish man lives for himself.

42:44.920 --> 42:48.520
A wise man lives with a purpose.

42:48.600 --> 42:51.640
And yours is to serve this family.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.560
And you will or so help me,

42:56.400 --> 43:00.600
I will take away the life
that God gave you.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.560
My father gave me this crucifix

43:10.800 --> 43:13.640
to remind me of my duty.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.080
It's yours now.

44:41.560 --> 44:42.880
Here.

44:47.960 --> 44:49.000
Ricciardo!

44:50.520 --> 44:52.120
How's it going?

44:53.160 --> 44:55.360
We've got off to a fast start,
Messer Lorenzo.

44:55.440 --> 44:59.240
Water down that wine!
I won't have any drunks on this site!

44:59.960 --> 45:03.800
If they say Mastro Brunelleschi
is a genius, I'm sure he is.

45:03.880 --> 45:05.120
- Stop that!
- To me, he looks mad.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.480
Get that food out of here!

45:07.560 --> 45:10.320
No one is to stop working!
Not even to eat!

45:31.640 --> 45:34.160
Cosimo, I know you believe
in the cathedral,

45:34.240 --> 45:37.800
and it is not my place to question
the wisdom of building it or the...

45:37.880 --> 45:41.360
legality of using Rome's tithes
to pay for it.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.920
I appreciate that, loyal Ugo.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.040
And I can see that men are back at work,
and... and that there is

45:47.120 --> 45:50.840
pride on the streets
where before there was only despair.

45:50.920 --> 45:54.200
But this war rages on.

45:54.280 --> 45:57.320
And the Pope's tithes
will not last indefinitely.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.320
I am aware of that,
and I intend to do something about it.

46:01.600 --> 46:02.760
I know.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.640
This is a dream
your father took from you long ago.

46:06.720 --> 46:12.400
And, perhaps, you sense...
now is the time to seize it after all.

46:13.320 --> 46:17.280
But some losses, once borne,

46:18.040 --> 46:20.560
can never be undone.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.760
Piero, saddle up.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.360
We're taking a ride.

46:39.320 --> 46:40.680
Where are we going?

46:40.760 --> 46:42.240
To the war.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.480
Cosimo de' Medici!

47:17.400 --> 47:20.600
-Shouldn't you be on the Florentine side?
-I came to see you, Francesco.

47:20.680 --> 47:25.040
-This is my son, Piero.
-Your father and I are old friends.

47:25.120 --> 47:27.560
-But you're... enemies.
-Hardly.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.760
General Sforza is one of the finest
soldiers of fortune in all of Italy.

47:31.480 --> 47:36.320
I am a mere condottiere,
to whom your father loaned money

47:36.400 --> 47:39.000
many years ago, when no one else would.

47:39.760 --> 47:42.680
I am not the kind of man
to forget a favor.

47:44.400 --> 47:47.040
I was hoping you'd say that.

47:47.120 --> 47:50.680
This war with Milan
has dragged on far too long.

47:50.760 --> 47:54.680
We have the advantage, my friend.
We must press it.

47:54.760 --> 47:57.400
What is it that the Duke of Milan seeks
from this victory?

47:57.480 --> 48:02.000
-Why... the city of Lucca, of course.
-Lucca is wealthy.

48:02.080 --> 48:06.240
What he seeks is revenue.

48:08.320 --> 48:10.000
Give this to the Duke.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.360
Tell him his guild
will confirm the contents.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.080
Tancredi?

49:13.160 --> 49:16.120
Victory is in hand!

49:16.200 --> 49:18.600
.A victory that will bring glory
to all of Florence!

49:18.680 --> 49:22.360
But only... if we persevere.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.920
Don't tell me that you're going
to vote again to support this scoundrel?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.440
Even as he means to destroy us?

49:29.240 --> 49:31.440
I don't intend to vote at all.

49:32.320 --> 49:35.000
We have to keep fighting
and stay strong.

49:35.080 --> 49:38.800
Then we will be victorious.
This is our city!

49:38.880 --> 49:41.240
This is our republic!

49:48.440 --> 49:49.800
General Sforza.

49:49.880 --> 49:52.720
I'm sorry to interrupt your speech,
Signor Albizzi.

49:52.800 --> 49:55.480
But there is no longer a need for it.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.240
Arrest this man at once.

49:57.320 --> 50:01.520
You may arrest me,
but if you do, you'll be jailing a friend.

50:02.880 --> 50:06.280
I have come to announce terms of a truce.

50:06.840 --> 50:07.840
A truce?

50:09.160 --> 50:12.680
The Duke of Milan
has withdrawn from Lucca.

50:13.720 --> 50:17.080
- The war is over.

50:32.840 --> 50:36.320
-You paid Milan to withdraw?
-I didn't.

50:37.480 --> 50:38.680
Lucca's guilds did.

50:47.440 --> 50:48.720
What's happened?

50:49.600 --> 50:53.240
The apothecary's dead.
I think he knew who killed your father.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.280
I told you no more blood.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.040
He was dead when I got there.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.440
Killed with this.

51:00.800 --> 51:03.960
-Whose initials are they?
-I don't know.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.280
Well, find out.

51:31.640 --> 51:32.640
The war ended,

51:32.720 --> 51:35.760
you might just have the resources
to complete this, brother.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.640
And the Pope will finally have his tithes.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.000
It will honor God.

51:40.960 --> 51:44.800
-Honor God or honor you?
-Whatever I achieve honors God.

51:53.160 --> 51:54.160
Father!

51:55.640 --> 51:56.640
What is it, son?

51:56.720 --> 51:58.520
Lucrezia's fever has broken.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.920
-This is most welcome news.
-Yes, but...

52:01.000 --> 52:03.560
that's not the only news.

52:03.640 --> 52:05.880
Her illness masked
another more serious condition.

52:05.960 --> 52:07.520
What condition?

52:08.480 --> 52:09.840
She's with child.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.440
I am to be a father.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.520
And you are to be a grandfather.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.560
Keep clear! Everybody keep clear!

52:34.480 --> 52:37.640
What is it, Ricciardo?
Was this man drunk?

52:43.480 --> 52:45.160
Messer, he wasn't drinking.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.400
It's the Black Death.
