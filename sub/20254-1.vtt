(J' RICHARD DAY LEWIS:
"There's A New Star In Heaven Tonight")

00:43.089 --> 00:49.047
J' Stars may come and stars may go

00:49.172 --> 00:54.589
J' Up there in that starry space

00:55.047 --> 01:01.839
J' But when one falls, God always calls

01:02.589 --> 01:09.381
J' A star to take its place

01:10.631 --> 01:17.839
J' There's a new star in heaven tonight

01:17.964 --> 01:24.464
J' That will never fade from our sight

01:25.297 --> 01:28.506
J' There's a new star at home

01:28.631 --> 01:32.089
J' In that far starry dome

01:32.214 --> 01:40.256
J' Shining down on his loved ones tonight

01:41.172 --> 01:47.672
J' There's a voice singing,
"Lead, kindly light"

01:47.797 --> 01:55.381
J' With a smile
that has made the world bright

01:55.506 --> 02:01.756
J' Valentino, goodbye

02:01.881 --> 02:07.631
J' But way up in the sky

02:07.756 --> 02:18.297
J' There's a new star in heaven tonight

02:21.631 --> 02:28.797
J' There's a voice singing,
"Lead, kindly light"

02:28.922 --> 02:36.256
J' With a smile
that has made the world bright

02:36.381 --> 02:44.172
J' Valentino, goodbye

02:44.297 --> 02:51.922
J' But way up in the sky

02:52.047 --> 02:59.506
J' There's a new star in heaven

02:59.631 --> 03:05.756
J' Tonight J'

03:07.006 --> 03:08.839
(People shouting)

03:08.964 --> 03:12.131
We want Rudy! We want Rudy...!

03:20.631 --> 03:22.797
(Horse whinnying)

03:29.172 --> 03:31.631
Personally, fellas,
I'm tickled pink by this turnout.

03:31.756 --> 03:34.422
They're squeezing out of the subways
like pomade out of a tube.

03:34.547 --> 03:38.589
Sure, why not? It's free, ain't it?
But how long is it gonna last?

03:38.714 --> 03:41.214
He oughta taken better care of himself.

03:41.339 --> 03:43.256
A lousy appendix!

03:43.381 --> 03:45.881
He should've Iayed off the booze, too.

03:46.006 --> 03:49.506
The moment he goes into the ground,
our grosses go with him.

03:49.631 --> 03:51.506
Right, so before they take him out of here,

03:51.631 --> 03:54.381
we gotta re-release his movies
into every theatre in the country.

03:54.506 --> 03:57.839
That's why I got the lab working night and
day, grinding out reprints of The Sheik.

03:57.964 --> 03:59.922
Which labs?

04:00.047 --> 04:02.964
Better not be Pathé, Jesse - I got
Son of the Sheik running through there.

04:03.089 --> 04:06.714
Listen, we've all got to get together on this.
Cash in on this publicity, but quick.

04:06.839 --> 04:08.464
All right, so what's the angle?

04:12.047 --> 04:13.506
We're getting outta here!

04:32.006 --> 04:36.381
(Crowd chanting)
We want Rudy! We want Rudy!

04:36.506 --> 04:39.339
(Glass breaking, sirens wailing)

04:39.464 --> 04:42.006
(Man) Mr McBride!

04:42.131 --> 04:43.506
Mr McBride!

04:43.631 --> 04:46.172
Hold this, sir.

04:48.381 --> 04:50.506
Sorry to bother you, Mr McBride.

04:50.631 --> 04:52.631
There's a guy here,
says he has to see you, sir.

04:54.172 --> 04:58.464
Say sweetie, you look kinda cute
all alone with your posy.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.422
Make a nice picture.

05:00.547 --> 05:03.006
- How about a big smile?
- Leave me alone.

05:03.131 --> 05:06.839
Hey, don't I know...
I know who you are!

05:06.964 --> 05:09.256
Hey, but <i>I'll</i> keep it under my hat.

05:09.381 --> 05:12.714
You wouldn't want those vultures
to get their hooks into you.

05:12.839 --> 05:16.672
How about it, Bianca, huh?
A little exclusive about you and Rudy?

05:16.797 --> 05:21.881
Exclusive? It was splashed across
every newspaper in the country.

05:22.006 --> 05:25.839
Yeah, that was over ten years ago.
Then it didn't matter.

05:25.964 --> 05:29.089
He was just an immigrant bumming
around New York, nothing but a gigolo.

05:29.214 --> 05:32.589
He was not a gigolo.
He was a professional dancer.

05:32.714 --> 05:36.214
Pretty risky, playing around
with someone like you,

05:36.339 --> 05:39.089
somebody married to a big noise
in the rackets.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.297
It was perfectly innocent.

05:41.422 --> 05:43.672
We were just two lonely foreigners

05:43.797 --> 05:46.506
finding a little companionship
on the dancefloor.

05:46.631 --> 05:50.089
Oh, yeah?
I heard all about the private lessons.

05:50.214 --> 05:53.089
Hey, that's great.
Now take a big sniff of the pansies.

05:53.214 --> 05:54.922
They're violets!

05:55.547 --> 05:59.172
Too bad. But from what I hear,
pansies would've been more appropriate.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.464
(J' Orchestra plays tango)

07:54.547 --> 07:56.422
<i>Ma Che bravo!</i>

08:05.297 --> 08:07.756
Bianca, forgive me.

08:07.881 --> 08:11.381
(Speaks Italian)

08:12.839 --> 08:15.839
- I forgot the time.
- Very fortunate for me.

08:15.964 --> 08:18.797
That was so exciting to watch.

08:18.922 --> 08:21.797
Rudy, is this gentleman
who I think he is?

08:21.922 --> 08:24.714
Oh, yes. Sorry.
This is Vaslav Nijinsky.

08:24.839 --> 08:28.797
Signor Nijinsky, this is my very dear friend
Bianca de Saulles.

08:28.922 --> 08:29.964
<i>Enchanté.</i>

08:31.256 --> 08:34.672
If you could've just seen him tripping
the light fantastic with that ballet dancer,

08:34.797 --> 08:36.172
you'd have gone bananas.

08:36.297 --> 08:38.297
Talk about
Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.

08:38.422 --> 08:40.256
(Man) 'Bianca was dancing
with the fairy?'

08:40.381 --> 08:43.464
No, she didn't dance with the fairy.
I'm talking about Valentino.

08:43.589 --> 08:44.922
'Why, did they fuck?'

08:45.047 --> 08:47.714
They looked as though they were
crazy about one another.

08:47.839 --> 08:49.756
'Valentino and the fairy?'

08:49.881 --> 08:54.464
No, not Valentino and the fairy.
Valentino and your wife.

08:54.589 --> 08:56.881
'For Christ, do you think
they go to bed together?'

08:57.006 --> 09:00.631
No, I don't think they do. I think
the hottest they ever get's holding hands

09:00.756 --> 09:03.922
while he gives her private lessons
on my dancefloor.

09:04.047 --> 09:06.256
They don't call him Saint Rudolfo
for nothing.

09:06.381 --> 09:09.839
- 'All right, listen, <i>I'll</i> be down there later.'
- Yeah, <i>I'll</i> see you later.

09:09.964 --> 09:11.964
_
<i>'</i> Mmh?

09:12.089 --> 09:14.881
- 'You keep it warm for me, toots.'
- Yeah.

09:15.006 --> 09:17.381
Yeah, I'm keeping it warm.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.422
Good afternoon, Miss Billie.

09:31.297 --> 09:33.672
OK, fellas.

09:33.797 --> 09:36.714
Straighten up, you look like
the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

09:40.006 --> 09:42.797
- What happened to you?
- You sent me for a haircut, Miss Billie.

09:42.922 --> 09:45.339
Not to Alcatraz, I didn't.

09:47.631 --> 09:51.256
- Biting your nails again, Frederico?
- Sorry, Miss Billie.

09:51.381 --> 09:54.089
Keep that up, and <i>I'll</i> put you
in a straightjacket,

09:54.214 --> 09:58.339
- Ah, snow in mid-summer.
- I'm getting it treated, Miss Billie.

09:58.464 --> 10:01.131
Poached or sunny side up?

10:03.964 --> 10:05.506
Who for Christ's sake are you?

10:05.631 --> 10:08.381
I'm Jimmy Grimaldi, the replacement
from the agency, Miss Billie.

10:08.506 --> 10:11.631
Oh, you are, are you? Well, you'd better
get some polish on your shoes, Jimmy,

10:11.756 --> 10:15.172
otherwise you'll end up shining
other people's - just like your predecessor.

10:15.297 --> 10:16.714
<i>I'll</i> try a new cream, Miss Billie.

10:16.839 --> 10:19.631
Ain't they never heard of spit
where you people come from?

10:20.797 --> 10:23.589
The only one to cut any ice
out of the whole bunch of you

10:23.714 --> 10:25.839
is Saint Rudolpho here.

10:26.797 --> 10:30.297
Even though he does act
as though he owned the joint.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.714
But I was giving a private lesson,
Miss Billie.

10:32.839 --> 10:35.589
You give too many private lessons.

10:36.631 --> 10:39.589
Lay off the de Saulles dame.

10:39.714 --> 10:41.964
Circulate more, baby.

10:42.089 --> 10:44.672
Give some of the older broads a whirl.

10:44.797 --> 10:46.714
They tip better.

10:47.589 --> 10:50.006
And while we're at it,
don't go welshing on the tips, Jimmy.

10:50.131 --> 10:53.381
It's fifty-fifty, and anybody
who forgets that is fired.

10:53.506 --> 10:55.797
And for Christ's sake smile!

10:55.922 --> 10:59.006
I've seen better line-ups
in the police gazette.

11:00.339 --> 11:02.631
(J' Orchestra strikes up)

11:22.547 --> 11:24.881
You dance divinely.

11:25.006 --> 11:29.089
Only with you. With everyone else
I have two left feet.

11:30.922 --> 11:33.339
I think you are too kind.

11:33.464 --> 11:35.964
I could dance all night with you.

11:36.089 --> 11:40.422
In your arms I can forget for a moment
that I am but a slave -

11:40.547 --> 11:43.881
everyone's to command
by the lift of an eyebrow.

11:44.006 --> 11:47.881
Oh, I can't bear to share you
with anyone.

11:48.006 --> 11:50.339
Come to me tonight.

11:50.464 --> 11:53.631
Nothing would give me greater pleasure...

11:56.422 --> 12:00.797
...if the health of my poor widowed mother
would permit it.

12:00.922 --> 12:03.339
You dear, sweet boy.

12:03.464 --> 12:08.089
<i>A bientét, ma be//e madonna
de la café triste.</i>

12:11.464 --> 12:14.047
Would Madam honour me
with the next dance?

12:21.339 --> 12:22.922
Hmm!

12:24.506 --> 12:27.297
Rudy, I've been thinking about
what you said.

12:27.422 --> 12:29.506
If I leave him, he'll kill me.

12:29.631 --> 12:32.839
He would never dare to touch
the wife of Rudolpho Valentino.

12:32.964 --> 12:35.631
I have considered it-
you must divorce him.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.506
Oh, Rudy, if only I could.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.131
I know he's cheating on me
with every chorine in town,

12:40.256 --> 12:42.339
but anyone crazy enough
to testify against him

12:42.464 --> 12:44.839
is going to end up as a hole
in the East River.

12:44.964 --> 12:48.339
I will testify.
Valentino is not afraid.

12:49.381 --> 12:54.464
That's wonderful of you, Rudy,
but how would you get the dirt on him?

12:55.297 --> 12:57.714
That won't be difficult. I...

13:02.089 --> 13:05.756
No more tea time hops with dagos
for you, baby. Blow, pretty boy.

13:05.881 --> 13:09.131
- The music is not quite over, Signore.
- It is for you, sweetheart.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.756
Now you go straighten up your lipstick
before you're one gimp guinea.

13:11.881 --> 13:14.047
- Jack...
- Shut up, goddamnit!

13:14.172 --> 13:16.631
Waltzing with wops is one thing,
but he's a pansy.

13:16.756 --> 13:20.797
Sir! I'm an artist,
a professional dancer.

13:20.922 --> 13:24.464
You know, I say any guy who dances
with another guy is a powder puff.

13:24.589 --> 13:27.631
- You got that, wop?
- I didn't tell him.

13:27.756 --> 13:31.381
Ah, Billie!
Someone left the stable door open.

13:31.506 --> 13:34.256
Then quit horsing around
with the customers.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.839
You're fired. Get off the floor.

13:35.964 --> 13:38.006
You know,
there ought to be a law

13:38.131 --> 13:40.839
stopping you lounge lizards
from sneaking into this country.

13:40.964 --> 13:43.381
Here, get yourself a bowl of spaghetti.

13:43.506 --> 13:46.172
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

13:46.297 --> 13:50.006
Hey, waiter!
Show me to the best table.

13:50.131 --> 13:52.631
I have just become a customer.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.464
(Moaning)

14:43.589 --> 14:45.714
(Door opens)

14:47.506 --> 14:50.047
- Watch the birdie!
- (Screams)

14:51.297 --> 14:53.589
I just waited an watched.

14:53.714 --> 14:56.089
I have known about them
for some time now, Bianca, dear,

14:56.214 --> 14:59.131
but I kept it from you
for fear of hurting you.

14:59.256 --> 15:02.172
We are all creatures of habit.

15:03.047 --> 15:04.714
Soon you'll be free of him.

15:04.839 --> 15:07.339
Oh, thank you.

15:07.464 --> 15:12.047
- How do you like it? <i>Al</i> dente?
- Oh, Rudy, any way you like.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.047
Oh, it's such a relief.

15:14.172 --> 15:17.256
If you only knew what I've been through.

15:17.381 --> 15:19.631
He frightens me.

15:19.756 --> 15:23.422
Right after the divorce we must go away -
somewhere <i>I'll</i> be safe.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.631
In California, on my farm.

15:25.756 --> 15:29.256
- There you'll be safe.
- That farm's a dream.

15:29.381 --> 15:34.131
Already in one year I've saved $800,
and that is no dream.

15:35.089 --> 15:37.672
Soon we'll have one just like that.

15:37.797 --> 15:39.964
And there's my diploma of agriculture
to prove it.

15:40.089 --> 15:43.172
How about your mama's steamship ticket?
You're saving up for that, too, remember?

15:43.297 --> 15:45.714
It won't be expensive.
I owe it to her.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.047
When father died,

15:49.172 --> 15:52.422
she worked very hard to bring up
the family and send me here.

15:54.797 --> 15:56.047
Wait till you meet her.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.422
We don't have to wait.

15:58.547 --> 16:00.881
I could sell me jewellery tomorrow
for plenty.

16:01.631 --> 16:05.797
But that belongs to you and Joey.
I wouldn't dream of it.

16:05.922 --> 16:08.131
And you won't mind taking him along?

16:08.256 --> 16:10.339
Every farmer needs a family.

16:11.589 --> 16:14.339
<i>I'll</i> have a head start.
Be patient.

16:14.464 --> 16:15.881
(Giggles)

16:16.006 --> 16:19.047
- We'll soon have enough to get married.
- We've got the money!

16:19.172 --> 16:20.839
Now what's stopping us?

16:20.964 --> 16:23.589
Rudy, we can't live here.

16:24.756 --> 16:27.422
It would not be honourable
for me to accept money from you.

16:27.547 --> 16:30.506
But you take money from other women.
What's the difference?

16:30.631 --> 16:33.172
The difference is, I love you.

16:34.589 --> 16:37.381
They buy my flattery and my time,

16:37.506 --> 16:40.214
but my love is not for sale.

16:40.339 --> 16:41.964
(Man) No, Eddie, no!

16:42.756 --> 16:45.131
- Mama...
- (Bianca) Oh, my God!

16:45.256 --> 16:47.464
Joey!Joey!

16:47.589 --> 16:49.381
Quickly, Bianca! Get out!

16:49.506 --> 16:52.964
- Go for the front door! Block him!
- I got him!

16:55.922 --> 16:57.964
- That's enough, you bastard.
- Shut up, lady!

16:58.089 --> 16:59.839
Now you're gonna get
what's coming to you.

16:59.964 --> 17:01.381
- (Screams)
- Keep that dame quiet!

17:01.506 --> 17:03.422
- Rudy!
- Put him out, Rocky!

17:07.631 --> 17:09.881
You're not taking him from me!

17:12.006 --> 17:15.339
You beat the murder rap on the grounds
you acted on maternal instinct, huh?

17:15.464 --> 17:18.422
He wanted to take my baby
away from me.

17:18.547 --> 17:21.922
Yeah, er...
I guess you did mean your son.

17:22.047 --> 17:25.589
Hey, you believe that story Valentino died
of ulcers or appendix or something -

17:25.714 --> 17:28.297
a healthy guy like that,
only 31 years old?

17:28.422 --> 17:30.381
Had everything anybody could ever want.

17:30.506 --> 17:32.506
All the women in the world at his feet.

17:32.631 --> 17:35.131
What did he have to worry about
to get ulcers?

17:35.256 --> 17:37.672
You think maybe your husband's old pals
rubbed him out?

17:37.797 --> 17:41.672
You know, a slug of arsenic,
a bullet in the gut?

17:41.797 --> 17:44.589
You gotta admit they ran him out of
New York, chased him to Hollywood.

17:44.714 --> 17:47.631
Some skeletons should be allowed
to rest in their closets.

17:47.756 --> 17:49.631
- You're June Mathis, aren't you?
- No.

17:49.756 --> 17:52.506
You... wait a minute!

17:52.631 --> 17:54.589
Hey, June.

17:54.714 --> 17:57.506
Cummings, remember?
Johnny.

17:57.631 --> 17:59.256
Hello, Johnny.

17:59.381 --> 18:02.381
Hey, some shock, huh? Whew!

18:02.506 --> 18:04.464
Everyone's jumping on the bandwagon.

18:04.589 --> 18:07.839
Mussolini even sent a guard of honour.
He hated Rudy's movies.

18:08.589 --> 18:11.964
Say, there's a story flying around
that he actually died in your arms.

18:12.089 --> 18:14.631
- Is that true?
- No!

18:14.756 --> 18:17.214
But if you've got the story,
why do you want the truth?

18:17.339 --> 18:20.797
Oh, give me a break, June.
All I need is one little quote.

18:20.922 --> 18:22.756
Coming from you,
it'll mean something.

18:22.881 --> 18:26.006
After all, you did launch the guy.

18:26.131 --> 18:28.797
You make him sound like a battleship.

18:29.839 --> 18:32.464
Not that he didn't always have
some kind of a fight on his hands.

18:32.589 --> 18:35.881
What would you call him - in a word?

18:36.006 --> 18:38.797
Huh! In a word.

18:39.839 --> 18:41.881
To me he was...

18:44.131 --> 18:46.256
...a dancer.

18:46.381 --> 18:47.839
That's right, he was a gigolo.

18:47.964 --> 18:50.922
Listen, by the time he hit Hollywood,

18:51.047 --> 18:54.881
he'd climbed out of the ballroom.
He was in cabaret.

18:55.006 --> 18:57.589
He was a partner to an exhibition dancer
on the skids.

18:57.714 --> 19:00.006
He carried that act
in more ways than one.

19:01.297 --> 19:03.506
Funny how he was dependent
on some dame all...

19:04.589 --> 19:06.172
...all his life.

19:06.297 --> 19:08.172
Is that where you discovered him,
in a cabaret?

19:10.256 --> 19:14.047
Ijust happened to be at Baron Long's
on the night of his...

19:15.506 --> 19:17.464
...farewell performance.

19:23.339 --> 19:25.797
<i>Ach, du /ieber Himmel,
so 'ne ScheiBe!</i>

19:25.922 --> 19:28.839
Now, look!
You got two more shows yet.

19:28.964 --> 19:31.464
- How about easing up on that, huh?
- Look!

19:31.589 --> 19:33.881
I've been in this business twenty years,
I know my limit.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.297
Sister, you are the limit.

19:36.422 --> 19:39.131
- Can I have a word with you, Valenti?
- Valentino.

19:39.256 --> 19:42.506
Hey! Anything...
Hey, anything you gotta say to him,

19:42.631 --> 19:44.756
you can say to me.
It's my act, not his.

19:44.881 --> 19:47.131
OK, then you listen to me.

19:47.797 --> 19:50.672
Now, I've got a bunch of this movie crowd
coming in for the next show,

19:50.797 --> 19:53.756
- and they're a pretty bad bunch.
- What'd you expect?

19:53.881 --> 19:56.797
- Los Angeles is still a cow town.
- Right.

19:56.922 --> 19:59.172
Then don't try
slipping these jokers the bull.

19:59.297 --> 20:02.506
You're not satisfied with our act,
I take it, Mr Long?

20:02.631 --> 20:06.339
- Baron Long, if you don't mind.
- Ah, excuse me.

20:06.464 --> 20:09.839
Oh, come on, she's so far over the hill,
she's below sea level.

20:10.631 --> 20:15.297
I know this isn't the Cocoanut Grove...
but I expect something for my money!

20:15.422 --> 20:17.964
I fell for your charm.

20:18.089 --> 20:21.047
Without these movie slobs,
I'm just another beer joint.

20:21.172 --> 20:24.339
So, you better get Miss Tain here
to tighten up her two-step,

20:24.464 --> 20:28.214
or you'll both be practising on the sidewalk.
Get the drift?

20:30.464 --> 20:32.881
See you out there in twenty minutes.

20:33.922 --> 20:35.464
Soben

20:35.589 --> 20:37.256
<i>Wiedersehen.</i>

20:42.506 --> 20:45.047
Charming individual.

20:48.422 --> 20:50.797
You'll forgive me, Miss Tain,

20:50.922 --> 20:53.714
but perhaps he has a point.

20:53.839 --> 20:57.797
- If you'd awakened in time for rehearsal...
- Aw, stow the eager beaver stuff!

20:57.922 --> 20:59.381
Anytime you want to...

20:59.506 --> 21:02.297
That two-bit musical I found you in
in Omaha,

21:02.422 --> 21:06.506
anytime you want to catch up to it OK,
or New York,

21:06.631 --> 21:09.964
maybe you want to walk back
into that de Saulles mess?

21:10.089 --> 21:13.047
A little hot for you still, huh?

21:14.964 --> 21:17.131
No!

21:17.256 --> 21:22.464
You're lucky to be touring the boonies
after what you did, killing a man.

21:24.922 --> 21:29.964
If you're keeping those Iapels polished
for a comeback, forget it.

21:32.131 --> 21:35.214
They have a long memory in New York.

21:36.631 --> 21:40.172
They seem to have forgotten you...
easily enough.

21:41.506 --> 21:43.756
Mr Kid Gloves.

21:43.881 --> 21:46.589
Is that what all those ladies paid you for?

21:49.631 --> 21:52.631
A real lady never pays for anything,
Miss Tain.

21:53.839 --> 21:55.297
Is that right?

21:55.422 --> 21:57.714
Well, God help you, junior.

21:57.839 --> 22:00.672
If you ever have anything worth taking,

22:00.797 --> 22:04.589
some bright bitch is gonna give you
the ride of your life.

22:13.881 --> 22:17.047
Hey, I'm sorry.

22:17.172 --> 22:22.089
It... it wouldn't have worked out with you
and that de Saulles dame anyway.

22:25.464 --> 22:27.297
Got a pin?

22:33.464 --> 22:36.714
(J' Orchestra plays jaunty tune)

22:42.464 --> 22:44.089
Pull the other one.

22:44.214 --> 22:46.922
Hey, girls.
A big train in a small tunnel.

22:47.047 --> 22:49.714
Just like last night. Ooh...

22:50.756 --> 22:53.422
<i>Die groBe Welt. The star</i> of <i>stars.</i>

22:53.547 --> 22:56.506
Baron Long... time no see.

22:56.631 --> 22:59.464
You're looking great, Bear-on.

22:59.589 --> 23:01.214
And your brother, huh?

23:01.339 --> 23:05.131
Welcome to your favourite...
your favourite place.

23:05.256 --> 23:08.631
- I bearly saw it.
- Your new table, Fatty.

23:10.381 --> 23:13.381
- Mr Fatty!
- Mr Fatty.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.839
Hey, put it there, Baron.

23:19.964 --> 23:22.339
(Electronic buzzing)

23:24.964 --> 23:27.422
Oh, Baron,
I didn't know you could dance.

23:28.381 --> 23:30.339
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

23:33.839 --> 23:36.381
Hey! What have we got here?

23:41.089 --> 23:43.297
Look at the lovely Easter bonnet.

23:45.631 --> 23:48.797
I guess I'm the life of the party.

23:58.964 --> 24:00.714
Hey! Pooey!

24:00.839 --> 24:02.214
Hey, Fatty!

24:02.339 --> 24:03.506
Pooey!

24:05.256 --> 24:07.797
Oh, honey...

24:09.047 --> 24:10.089
What'll it be, Fatty?

24:11.381 --> 24:13.381
Mr Fatty?

24:13.506 --> 24:16.089
You learn fast, you Bavarian bum.

24:16.214 --> 24:20.464
Those big pots of beer for everybody.

24:20.589 --> 24:23.922
I want a Ramos Fizz.
They make 'em real creamy here, OK?

24:24.047 --> 24:28.047
I guess I said beer though, didn't I?

24:28.172 --> 24:29.881
(Electronic buzzing)

24:31.881 --> 24:35.172
Oh... What did I say, huh?

24:35.297 --> 24:37.464
What did I say?

24:37.589 --> 24:39.797
Beer, Meanie.

24:39.922 --> 24:41.506
- Mr Meanie!
- (Electronic buzzing)

24:41.631 --> 24:43.506
Ow!

24:43.631 --> 24:45.756
(J' Drum roll)

24:49.589 --> 24:52.089
(Audience cheers, claps)

25:16.631 --> 25:17.922
(sooing)

25:40.631 --> 25:42.881
Hey! What have we got here, huh?

25:43.006 --> 25:46.381
A floor show or a cattle drive?

25:48.006 --> 25:50.547
Breathe deeply, ignore them.

26:00.381 --> 26:04.297
Hey, if you're out of booze,
just have this bimbo sweat in a glass.

26:09.589 --> 26:12.964
You're a professional -
obscure them with your chin.

26:21.131 --> 26:23.214
Somebody's not laughing.

26:55.131 --> 26:56.631
Hey, Sister!

26:56.756 --> 26:59.256
You dance like my ass chews gum!

27:14.964 --> 27:16.672
Forty-six skidoo!

27:16.797 --> 27:19.339
And that means both of you.

27:22.047 --> 27:24.131
(J' Music stops)

27:24.256 --> 27:27.839
Hey, do me a favour, huh?
Get off!

27:45.589 --> 27:49.839
Madam, permit me
to complete your dance card.

28:00.547 --> 28:02.506
<i>El Chocolo.</i>

28:03.631 --> 28:05.631
(J' Orchestra strikes up)

28:16.047 --> 28:18.131
I'm sorry.

29:16.214 --> 29:18.047
(Audience laughs)

29:50.006 --> 29:53.297
- Valenti...
- Don't tell me. I know.

29:53.422 --> 29:54.464
You're fired.

30:15.797 --> 30:18.756
(J' "0 Sole Mio" on piano)

30:21.047 --> 30:24.631
J' 0 Sole mio

30:24.756 --> 30:28.464
J' Sta 'nfronte a me!

30:28.589 --> 30:31.756
J' Sta 'nfronte...

30:50.756 --> 30:55.422
J' Che bella cosa... J'

30:55.547 --> 30:58.172
(Humming)

30:58.881 --> 31:02.631
Cor, Fatty sure is going to be
mad at me.

31:02.756 --> 31:05.797
You are much better off
without that elephante.

31:06.881 --> 31:08.422
- Ramos Fizz?
- Yeah.

31:08.547 --> 31:10.506
- Is it nice?
- Yeah.

31:10.631 --> 31:14.256
- Nice and creamy.
- Yeah, I like them really creamy.

31:14.381 --> 31:18.714
That's why Fatty don't like me ordering 'em,
on account he has to lose weight.

31:18.839 --> 31:23.839
J' Then he'd have nothing

31:23.964 --> 31:27.131
J' To chuck around... J'

31:30.422 --> 31:32.422
Sorry about this old mess here.

31:32.547 --> 31:35.047
My maid ain't in tonight.

31:36.464 --> 31:39.464
- You mean you live here all alone?
- Yeah.

31:39.589 --> 31:43.339
I'm getting a bigger spot, too.
Soon as I get a raise.

31:43.464 --> 31:46.881
Two more pictures
and my contract's up for renewal.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.297
- Pictures?
- Yeah.

31:52.131 --> 31:55.506
I guess you're not exactly
a charmed member of my fan club, huh?

31:55.631 --> 31:58.922
I'm sorry.
I don't go to many movies.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.839
But I'm sure I've seen you
somewhere before.

32:00.964 --> 32:03.297
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.464
Well, don't worry about it.

32:05.589 --> 32:07.589
There's plenty that have.

32:08.672 --> 32:11.714
You ain't even seen
the poster for my new movie?

32:11.839 --> 32:14.131
They were all over town.

32:14.256 --> 32:17.506
Well, I've just arrived from Omaha.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.714
Yeah? Well, say...

32:20.839 --> 32:24.714
You ought to try pictures yourself
if you're staying for a while.

32:24.839 --> 32:27.006
You got a lot of style.

32:27.131 --> 32:30.089
I mean that as a strictly professional
compliment.

32:30.214 --> 32:32.631
I haven't had much acting experience,
I'm afraid.

32:32.756 --> 32:34.381
Acting, hmm?

32:34.506 --> 32:38.881
No, all you need in movies
is to look sincere.

32:39.006 --> 32:40.964
Let me tell you, brother.

32:41.089 --> 32:44.506
Looking sincere in this town
is a lot of hard work.

32:44.631 --> 32:47.256
There must be more to acting than that.

32:47.381 --> 32:51.506
No, silly. Nobody even hears
a word you're saying.

32:51.631 --> 32:54.464
So, lots of times when I'm supposed
to be saying my lines,

32:54.589 --> 32:58.756
Ijust mouth a lot of cuss words
to try and break up the kids on the crew.

32:58.881 --> 33:02.422
Maybe you can teach me
a few cuss words.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.964
Sure.

33:05.631 --> 33:08.214
I do feel kinda responsible for you.

33:09.047 --> 33:11.172
Losing your job and all.

33:12.672 --> 33:16.089
Was the erm... lady taking care of you?

33:17.381 --> 33:21.006
I'm unattached, unemployed...
no strings.

33:21.131 --> 33:23.631
Oh, you'll do all right.

33:25.839 --> 33:30.547
Would you believe it?
Last year I was waiting tables in Dallas.

33:34.881 --> 33:37.172
Just imagine.

33:43.297 --> 33:45.172
(June) Well, Richard,
what do you think?

33:45.297 --> 33:47.339
(Richard) He looks what he is,
a dancehall gigolo.

33:47.464 --> 33:50.297
Come on, Richard, what do you expect?
It's a Keystone two-reeler.

33:50.422 --> 33:53.381
Now, forget the part he's playing
and use your imagination.

33:54.006 --> 33:56.631
Ah! Now there's a possibility.

33:56.756 --> 33:59.006
(Laughs) For Wally Reid?

33:59.131 --> 34:02.089
Hey, don't laugh.
He's a star - big box office.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.756
Not a...
not a bit player like your man.

34:04.881 --> 34:09.005
You see, honey, Wally's the boy next door
all the women love.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.714
(June) I know the women of America,

34:10.839 --> 34:13.422
and they want to vamoose
from the boy next door.

34:13.547 --> 34:17.047
Valentino's their ticket
to a faraway land of romance.

34:17.172 --> 34:24.214
Now remember, our hero in the movie
is from South America, not South Dakota.

34:24.339 --> 34:29.047
You give Reid sideburns and a bottle
of brilliantine, and he's as Latin as, er...

34:29.172 --> 34:32.505
you know, er...
as a Mexican jumping bean.

34:34.422 --> 34:37.214
More like six foot of home-grown corn.

34:38.505 --> 34:39.505
Mmh.

34:39.630 --> 34:42.839
But at least he's tried and tested.
Now, we're making a million-dollar movie.

34:42.964 --> 34:45.464
How can I take a chance
on an unknown like Valentine?

34:45.589 --> 34:47.505
(June) Valentino.
(Richard) Yeah, Valentino.

34:47.630 --> 34:49.714
(June) You like him when he danced
at Baron Long's.

34:49.839 --> 34:52.089
(Richard) Our picture isn't going to be
one long tango.

34:52.214 --> 34:55.797
The part calls for a great Latin lover.
The schmuck looks like a tailor's dummy.

34:57.214 --> 34:59.506
(June) Well, he does have to
dance with her.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.631
The only time Wally looks good
is when he's holding a football.

35:07.214 --> 35:08.631
Yeah.

35:09.589 --> 35:12.089
Come on now, Richard.
What do you say?

35:12.756 --> 35:16.964
Well, he wears a custard pie as well as
the next man, but honey, he'd...

35:17.089 --> 35:21.381
He'd look better carrying a tray
than carrying a picture. I've seen enough.

35:21.506 --> 35:24.881
No, wait a minute. OK, wait.
Now, that was a mistake,

35:25.006 --> 35:27.506
but wait a minute, I want you
to see him in something romantic.

35:27.631 --> 35:30.089
I want you to see him
in something dramatic.

35:30.214 --> 35:33.756
Honey, I can't offer this guy
to a director like Rex Ingram.

35:33.881 --> 35:39.714
He'll buy it. Don't you forget, you didn't
want Rex either until I sold him to you.

35:39.839 --> 35:41.839
Befl”.Ben?

35:41.964 --> 35:44.506
<i>Can you kill this</i> and <i>run
The Married Virgin?</i>

35:44.631 --> 35:46.506
<i>Married Virgin? (Laughs)</i>

35:46.631 --> 35:50.464
What I hear of Valentino,
it's the perfect casting.

35:50.589 --> 35:52.297
I'm sorry, June.

35:52.422 --> 35:54.839
Well, at least give him a screen test.

35:54.964 --> 35:57.131
It would be a waste of good film stock.

35:57.256 --> 36:01.297
Hey, isn't that the jerk that married that
starlet - what's her name - Jean Acker?

36:01.422 --> 36:04.964
And on their wedding night she looked him
out of the honeymoon suite, eh?

36:05.089 --> 36:09.256
This guy doesn't want a screen test,
he wants a sex test. (Laughs)

36:09.922 --> 36:13.339
Oh, what about your wholesome
boy next door, Wally Reid -

36:13.464 --> 36:15.631
can he get through a day
without cocaine?

36:15.756 --> 36:19.714
At least Wally sniffs it, which is more
than Valentino does for his wife.

36:19.839 --> 36:21.506
Oh, Richard, now come on.

36:22.422 --> 36:24.506
You gotta trust me.

36:24.631 --> 36:27.339
If the test is no good,
you pay for the film stock.

36:27.464 --> 36:29.256
You got a deal.

36:29.381 --> 36:31.047
OK.

36:32.797 --> 36:36.297
Skip the rest, Bert.
Send all the stuff back to the distributors.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.631
You look as if you're lost.

36:41.756 --> 36:44.339
- Miss Mathis?
- That's me.

36:44.464 --> 36:47.381
Your secretary said
I should come right on up.

36:48.422 --> 36:53.256
You... you are not Mr Rudolph Valentino
by any chance?

36:53.381 --> 36:57.714
It's Valentino right now,
but I'm thinking of changing it to Rudolph.

36:57.839 --> 37:01.089
(Coughs) I mean, Richard Valentine.

37:01.214 --> 37:04.381
Howdy, ma'am?
Pleased to meet you.

37:04.506 --> 37:06.464
Afraid I'm a mite early,

37:06.589 --> 37:10.381
but I guess I'm just a natural get-up
and go-getter.

37:10.506 --> 37:15.339
Well, I, er... I'm not sure that
you're early enough, er...

37:15.464 --> 37:18.256
Richard, we were just
checking through your credits.

37:18.381 --> 37:20.381
I have my credentials right here.

37:20.506 --> 37:24.422
My diploma - I graduated
with first class honours.

37:24.547 --> 37:27.297
- Diploma?
- Yeah, right here.

37:30.297 --> 37:34.547
<i>Co//egio Rea/e Agricolo.</i> ..

37:34.672 --> 37:38.297
The Royal Agricultural College of Genoa?

37:38.422 --> 37:41.256
Not unlike Yale in many ways.

37:41.381 --> 37:45.047
And you want to cultivate a big crop
of lettuce here in California, right?

37:45.172 --> 37:46.839
Not lettuce. Oranges.

37:46.964 --> 37:50.672
- Oranges?
- Yeah, I aim to buy an orange grove.

37:51.922 --> 37:53.714
But my mother is far from well,

37:53.839 --> 37:56.631
and first I must make some money
to bring her over from Italy.

37:56.756 --> 38:00.006
Well, maybe you're about to do just that.

38:00.131 --> 38:02.506
D'you know why you're here?

38:02.631 --> 38:06.214
You are writing a screenplay
and are wanting me for the hero, I hope.

38:06.339 --> 38:08.006
Am I right?

38:08.131 --> 38:10.089
You know what sort of a hero?

38:10.214 --> 38:12.964
There's only one sort -
the clean-cut American boy,

38:13.089 --> 38:16.047
and as you can see,
I'm as Yankee as they come.

38:16.172 --> 38:18.506
<i>Yeah, but the hero</i> of
<i>The Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse</i>

38:18.631 --> 38:21.922
is a Gaucho from Argentina
with a taste for the tango -

38:22.047 --> 38:24.589
and he's Latin.

38:25.756 --> 38:29.839
Count Rodolfo Alfonso Rafaello Pierre
Filibert Guglielmi di Valentina D'Antonguolla

38:29.964 --> 38:31.797
at your service, Signorina.

38:34.964 --> 38:38.214
Every day is Halloween in Tinseltown.

38:39.464 --> 38:41.589
(J' Tango Pl3Y5)

38:45.006 --> 38:46.839
(J' Music stops)

38:50.381 --> 38:52.922
(J' Music resumes)

39:09.131 --> 39:12.797
So, I said to June, of course it's a gamble.
Whoever heard of a dago playing a dago?

39:12.922 --> 39:14.922
At least, I said,
let's give the guy a screen test.

39:15.047 --> 39:17.089
Well, the rest is history. June?

39:17.214 --> 39:20.047
- Hello, June.
- Morning, folks.

39:20.172 --> 39:23.631
Just running the tango scene, Richard,
trying out some music.

39:23.756 --> 39:25.047
That sounds good. OK...

39:25.172 --> 39:27.964
I'm gonna leave you here with June.
Let me know what you think, huh?

39:28.089 --> 39:30.506
<i>Au revoir, Richard. Merci bien.</i>

39:30.631 --> 39:34.006
Is that Valentino?
Well, he certainly can dance.

39:35.631 --> 39:39.047
Yes. I like...

39:39.172 --> 39:42.631
Yes, I like very much.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.839
Very good. Oh!

39:45.964 --> 39:47.964
Beautiful, beautiful animal!

39:48.089 --> 39:52.006
Like a tiger.
He moves like a tiger.

39:53.172 --> 39:55.089
What grace.

39:55.214 --> 39:57.089
What sensuality.

39:57.214 --> 39:59.881
Oh, how clever you are,
dyevushka.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.047
Thank you, Nazimova.

40:02.172 --> 40:05.214
I think he's got class.

40:05.339 --> 40:07.672
This is the guy
you've been looking for.

40:09.506 --> 40:12.631
He would make perfect Armand
to my Camille...

40:14.089 --> 40:15.714
...if he can act.

40:15.839 --> 40:18.131
(Natasha) With you,
they don't have to act, darling.

40:18.256 --> 40:20.714
What a treasure.

40:20.839 --> 40:24.964
June, dyevushka.
Come and meet my latest discovery.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.339
Natasha Rambova.

40:28.464 --> 40:30.422
- Hi, Natasha.
- Hello.

40:30.547 --> 40:33.297
Since last night,
she's my new designer.

40:33.422 --> 40:35.214
Two discoveries in one day?

40:35.339 --> 40:39.464
Mmh! What dignity!
I must meet him today. Where is he?

40:39.589 --> 40:42.422
Well, at the moment they're
out in the valley shooting a battle scene.

40:42.547 --> 40:45.214
If you like him, you'd better
stake your claim right now

40:45.339 --> 40:49.172
because when this movie's released,
there's gonna be a second gold rush.

40:49.297 --> 40:51.047
<i>Merci, ma chérie.</i>

40:51.172 --> 40:54.381
Oh, what glamour, what elegance.
Almost like a woman.

40:54.506 --> 40:57.881
- Maybe his wife thought so, too.
- Oh, you naughty girl.

41:22.297 --> 41:24.922
Every day is Halloween in Tinseltown.

41:26.464 --> 41:28.339
Holy cow!

42:05.339 --> 42:07.422
Where is he?

42:07.547 --> 42:11.047
Where is my sweet Armand?

42:24.964 --> 42:26.297
Ooh!

42:31.422 --> 42:34.172
Hey, Nazimova, we missed it.
One more time for the New York Post.

42:36.172 --> 42:38.214
And what a shame!

42:38.339 --> 42:41.797
She would've made
tomorrow's front page for sure.

42:46.506 --> 42:49.506
Armand, my love.

42:49.631 --> 42:52.964
It is I, your Camille.

42:54.881 --> 42:57.172
I must be brave.

42:58.589 --> 43:01.756
No! No! No!

43:02.256 --> 43:04.172
I cannot.

43:04.297 --> 43:07.006
The pain is too great.

43:07.131 --> 43:09.547
Ah, I think I will faint.

43:09.672 --> 43:11.214
Hey, come on.

43:17.047 --> 43:19.297
(Clapping)

43:19.422 --> 43:21.464
(Laughing, cheering)

43:21.589 --> 43:22.839
Bravo!

43:23.464 --> 43:25.131
Please, please...

43:25.256 --> 43:27.797
Bravo! Wonderful!

43:27.922 --> 43:30.881
How well I remember

43:31.006 --> 43:34.006
that fateful meeting.

43:34.131 --> 43:37.922
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

43:38.047 --> 43:40.547
were loose in the land.

43:40.672 --> 43:44.131
(Horses approaching, whinnying)

43:44.256 --> 43:46.422
(Gunfire)

43:51.172 --> 43:52.839
(Horse whinnying)

43:52.964 --> 43:55.131
(Klaxon)

43:55.256 --> 43:56.589
(Horse whinnying)

43:57.214 --> 43:58.797
Cut it!

43:58.922 --> 44:01.339
- Cut it!
- (Car horn beeps)

44:01.464 --> 44:03.422
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

44:03.547 --> 44:05.214
Get that heap out of here.

44:05.339 --> 44:08.631
What daring! What symbolism!

44:10.631 --> 44:13.047
What an awful lot of horseshit!

44:13.172 --> 44:14.422
- Andrew, my boy.
- Yes, sir?

44:14.547 --> 44:17.172
- Your outrage was commendable.
- Well, thank you, sir.

44:17.297 --> 44:19.047
- You like your job?
- Yes, sir.

44:19.172 --> 44:22.047
Then you'd better learn to recognise
the uncrowned queen of Metro.

44:22.172 --> 44:23.797
- Nazimova!
- Get me a drink.

44:23.922 --> 44:26.006
- Come on, let's go.
- (Horse whinnying)

44:26.131 --> 44:28.714
<i>Rex! Me/yushka!</i>

44:28.839 --> 44:34.964
Which one is Italian boy whose name
wafts like garlic on every breath in town?

44:35.089 --> 44:36.839
Randolph something or other.

44:36.964 --> 44:39.464
- Any more, sir?
- Take her to Valentino.

44:39.589 --> 44:42.256
That woman will be the death of me.
Reload!

44:42.381 --> 44:45.881
Death?
No, this is truly symbolic.

44:47.464 --> 44:53.256
Our meeting on this wasteland
harbingers death of commerce

44:53.381 --> 44:57.547
and for you, my dear sweet boy,
birth of art.

44:57.672 --> 45:01.047
You can take your art, lady,
and stuff it up your ass!

45:02.839 --> 45:07.131
Natasha, translate please.
He has picked up terrible accent.

45:07.256 --> 45:11.131
He said... (Translates)

45:11.256 --> 45:15.172
(Swears in Russian)

45:16.131 --> 45:20.506
Miss Nazimova, that's not Valentino.
He's over there.

45:20.631 --> 45:24.506
Ugh! Rex is naughty boy
to playjoke on Nazimova.

45:24.631 --> 45:28.756
Fellow artists should only play jokes
on studio bosses, not on each other.

45:28.881 --> 45:30.922
Drive on!

45:31.964 --> 45:34.131
(J' Italian song on gramophone)

45:34.256 --> 45:37.172
Get us a coffee while you're in there,
will you?

45:38.214 --> 45:42.089
(Chuckles) Anyway, it's terrible cliche
to show death as man.

45:42.214 --> 45:43.631
Is it?

45:45.172 --> 45:48.756
- Well, where is he?
- Over there.

45:48.881 --> 45:51.839
You will forgive me, Miss Nazimova,
for saying so,

45:51.964 --> 45:55.422
but I don't think Rudy's really exactly
in the mood for company.

45:55.547 --> 45:57.714
- I beg your pardon?
- I am sorry.

45:57.839 --> 46:02.006
It's just that, well, he's had
a letter from Italy this morning.

46:02.131 --> 46:04.381
His mother just passed away.

46:22.881 --> 46:27.631
Natasha... we have found our Armand.

46:34.297 --> 46:37.672
We'll have to do something
about those awful eyebrows.

46:37.797 --> 46:39.589
Ooh...

47:43.172 --> 47:48.131
Oh, that I could have sacrificed my life
for him in reality

47:48.256 --> 47:52.964
as I sacrificed myself for him
long ago in Camille.

47:53.089 --> 47:55.131
Do you ever plan on
making a comeback, Nazimova?

47:55.256 --> 47:57.922
I am waiting for the right vehicle.

47:58.047 --> 47:59.547
A hearse yet.

47:59.672 --> 48:02.256
Did the failure of Camille
set back Valentino's career?

48:02.381 --> 48:04.756
Camille was a triumph.

48:04.881 --> 48:09.297
Only money lenders equate
box office receipts with artistic merit.

48:09.422 --> 48:11.672
Camille was turning point
in Valentino's life.

48:11.797 --> 48:14.172
Is it right that he turned down
the part of John the Baptist

48:14.297 --> 48:16.339
in your homosexual production
of Salome?

48:16.464 --> 48:17.672
He was unavailable.

48:17.797 --> 48:20.214
- So, Rudy never worked with you again?
- Oh, poppycock!

48:20.339 --> 48:23.047
<i>We worked</i> on <i>History of Dance project.</i>

48:23.172 --> 48:27.797
Russian ballet, Greek dancing.
Big production.

48:27.922 --> 48:30.297
We even made storyboard
in my own home.

48:30.422 --> 48:32.672
Isn't that so, Natasha?

48:32.797 --> 48:35.631
Only no studio would finance it.
No vision.

48:35.756 --> 48:37.714
Were you the art director
on that one, Natasha?

48:37.839 --> 48:41.881
Naturally!
We were one big happy family.

48:42.006 --> 48:44.714
Oh, Natasha, dyevushka.

48:44.839 --> 48:47.089
Come to Nazimova.

48:47.214 --> 48:50.381
Come into my arms, my little one.

48:53.297 --> 48:56.381
(Reporter) Did Rudy's death
come as a shock to you, Mrs Valentino?

48:56.506 --> 48:58.714
Nazimova never stops thinking about...

48:58.839 --> 49:01.089
(Reporter) Was he ill
at the time of your separation?

49:01.214 --> 49:03.547
- We were never separated.
- June!

49:03.672 --> 49:08.881
We were torn apart physically for a while
by the evil forces in Hollywood.

49:10.631 --> 49:13.506
But we never lost Contact
on the spiritual plane.

49:13.631 --> 49:15.797
- (Reporter) Which ended with his death.
- Not at all.

49:15.922 --> 49:18.964
(Reporter) Has Valentino any message
for his host of worshippers?

49:19.089 --> 49:21.297
(Laughs)

49:21.422 --> 49:23.256
He has a message for everyone.

49:24.464 --> 49:27.839
"Dreaming when dawn's left hand
was in the sky,

49:28.922 --> 49:32.006
"I heard a voice
from out the heavens cry,

49:33.131 --> 49:36.881
"awake my little one and fill the cup

49:37.006 --> 49:40.839
"before life's liquor in its flask be dry."

49:40.964 --> 49:43.381
(Reporter 1)
He's advocating an end to prohibition?

49:43.506 --> 49:45.506
(Reporter 2)
Is that a quote from his book of poems?

49:45.631 --> 49:48.089
(Reporter 3) Sounds more like
the Rubéiyét than Rudy.

49:48.214 --> 49:51.381
Under my tutelage
Valentino became both a poet

49:51.506 --> 49:54.214
and a disciple of Omar Khayyém.

49:54.339 --> 49:57.881
(Reporter) Is Omar the spirit medium
through which you Contact Rudy?

50:00.589 --> 50:02.381
Meselope.

50:02.506 --> 50:05.339
(Reporter) Meselope? Who's Meselope?

50:13.547 --> 50:17.006
Take the bones of Meselope
and cast them in the sand before me.

50:18.589 --> 50:20.214
What is Meselope?

50:20.339 --> 50:23.631
A key from the past to unlock
the mysteries of the future.

50:24.589 --> 50:30.256
Meselope was a High Priest to the God
Osiris in Egypt, 3,000 years ago.

50:30.381 --> 50:31.756
<i>Sacra Madonna!</i>

50:34.131 --> 50:35.172
What do you see?

50:37.631 --> 50:39.839
Do you see love?

50:47.589 --> 50:49.964
I see trouble.

50:50.089 --> 50:54.047
Hi, Rudy. Ijust saw the dailies.
You're terrific.

50:54.172 --> 50:57.214
We're gonna wrap early, Rudy,
because we've got a light problem.

50:57.339 --> 51:00.506
Hello, Natasha, what are you doing here?
Having a picnic?

51:00.631 --> 51:03.381
Will you save those bones for my dogs?

51:03.506 --> 51:05.506
I'd really like to
send your dresser home early.

51:05.631 --> 51:07.547
It's all right, George. <i>l'll</i> manage.

51:07.672 --> 51:11.922
- Well, just remember to fold...
- ...everything away neatly. Yes, George.

51:12.797 --> 51:15.256
Well, watch out for sand snakes.

51:15.381 --> 51:17.797
And if you ever want a job as a slave girl,
just give me a ring.

51:18.839 --> 51:20.839
- Yeah.
- Fine.

51:20.964 --> 51:24.589
If you ever want to learn
how to run a studio, just give me one.

51:25.422 --> 51:27.506
Good night, Mr Lasky.

51:27.631 --> 51:28.714
Good night.

51:28.839 --> 51:31.839
And try to save a little something
for the big rape scene tomorrow, huh?

51:34.422 --> 51:36.672
- Let's go, George.
- Yes, sir.

51:45.214 --> 51:48.922
"Here with a loaf of bread
beneath the bough,

51:49.047 --> 51:53.006
"a flask of wine, a book of verse,

51:53.131 --> 51:57.047
"and thou beside me
singing in the wilderness,

51:57.172 --> 52:00.839
"and wilderness is paradise enough."

52:00.964 --> 52:04.797
- Did you write that?
- (Chuckles) Omar Khayyém.

52:04.922 --> 52:08.464
Hey, maybe he can write our subtitles.

52:08.589 --> 52:10.714
He's sort of retired.

52:10.839 --> 52:15.672
Anyway, be kind of a mouthful to say
during the big rape scene, don't you think?

52:15.797 --> 52:19.756
You couldn't by any chance
be kidding me, could you?

52:19.881 --> 52:21.964
I've never been more serious.

52:29.297 --> 52:31.547
You've got to be careful now.

52:31.672 --> 52:34.547
<i>The Four Horsemen</i> and <i>Camille
made you</i> a <i>star.</i>

52:34.672 --> 52:36.714
They were quality movies.

52:36.839 --> 52:40.297
You shouldn't be wasting your talent
on this sheik stuff.

52:40.422 --> 52:44.422
- Meselope's bones?
- No, my own.

52:44.547 --> 52:48.839
- Your bones told me to leave Metro.
- And you doubled your salary.

52:48.964 --> 52:51.506
The next step is script approval.

52:51.631 --> 52:54.922
- What if Lasky refuses?
- Kiss him goodbye.

52:55.047 --> 52:57.506
Become independent
and produce your own films.

52:57.631 --> 52:59.422
Nazimova did it.

52:59.547 --> 53:02.881
Do you think any of the majors would've
backed a work of art like Salome?

53:04.214 --> 53:08.506
Those shoe pedlars think "ars gratia artis"
means "a great piece of ass".

53:11.547 --> 53:13.506
How is Salome?

53:13.631 --> 53:15.881
I finished my set designs last week,

53:16.631 --> 53:21.006
and now I'm teaching Nazimova
the Dance Of The Seven Veils.

53:29.756 --> 53:32.797
You should be playing Salome yourself.

53:40.214 --> 53:41.797
You like it then?

53:45.297 --> 53:48.131
I would give half my kingdom
for you to finish it.

54:46.631 --> 54:48.297
Well, where is it?

54:48.422 --> 54:50.214
- Where is what?
- Half your kingdom.

54:50.339 --> 54:53.714
Natasha, you know I love you.

54:53.839 --> 54:55.922
Promises, promises,
you're as bad as Herod.

54:56.047 --> 54:58.214
He wouldn't pay up either.

54:59.964 --> 55:02.631
I meant I will give you anything.

55:02.756 --> 55:06.464
Yes, I know what you were planning
to give me.

55:06.589 --> 55:08.672
Can you blame me?

55:09.756 --> 55:11.839
Yes, but you were cheating.

55:11.964 --> 55:16.339
You can't give me half your kingdom
because it already belongs to your wife.

55:16.464 --> 55:17.756
Wife?

55:17.881 --> 55:21.172
You know my marriage to Jean
is no marriage at all.

55:21.297 --> 55:23.797
I know she's suing you
for separate maintenance.

55:24.839 --> 55:27.506
The whole thing was a disaster.

55:27.631 --> 55:30.006
Yes, I heard about the honeymoon fiasco.

55:31.089 --> 55:35.256
They say that when it got right down to it,
you couldn't even pay the bill.

55:36.172 --> 55:37.422
I was down on my luck.

55:37.547 --> 55:39.964
Yes, and when your luck changed,
you walked out on her.

55:40.089 --> 55:42.381
She did the walking, not me.

55:44.339 --> 55:46.631
Then you should file a cross complaint...

55:48.339 --> 55:49.631
...for divorce.

55:49.756 --> 55:51.631
I couldn't.

55:52.589 --> 55:55.506
Last time I got mixed up in a divorce,
somebody got hurt.

55:56.881 --> 56:02.381
Besides, it's not honourable to sully
a woman's reputation in the courts.

56:02.506 --> 56:05.339
A court, a tent, what's the difference?

56:08.256 --> 56:11.381
If I sue for divorce,

56:11.922 --> 56:14.297
would you accept it?

56:14.422 --> 56:17.506
- Accept what?
- Half my kingdom.

56:20.631 --> 56:23.006
I never do anything halfway, darling.

56:23.839 --> 56:27.131
That's one thing you should
learn about me right now...

56:28.214 --> 56:30.922
...if I'm going to become your wife.

56:31.047 --> 56:33.339
Natasha!

56:33.464 --> 56:35.964
You make me the happiest of men.

56:40.422 --> 56:42.381
Just look at that costume!

56:42.506 --> 56:46.256
And you promised to fold it away neatly
for the big rape scene tomorrow.

56:47.672 --> 56:49.214
Now, would you get dressed?

56:49.339 --> 56:51.464
You look silly lying there
in nothing but a turban.

59:02.631 --> 59:05.089
(J' CHRIS ELLIS: "The Sheik Of Araby")

Natasha... Pazha/sta! No, please!

01:00:59.297 --> 01:01:03.256
Darling, darling.
Oh, Natasha, please. Dyevushka...

01:01:03.381 --> 01:01:04.672
Neat trick!

01:01:04.797 --> 01:01:07.339
You talk us into doing a storyboard
for the next movie,

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:09.381
then you sell it to the press
as pornography.

01:01:09.506 --> 01:01:13.547
Oh, but I did not plan it that way.
Please, believe me, dyevushka.

01:01:13.672 --> 01:01:15.839
Oh, we will still make the dance film, yes?

01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:18.756
We will still make the dance film, no!

01:01:18.881 --> 01:01:22.464
Meselope says
it's time to change partners.

01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:24.922
- I'm getting married.
- Oh, but you can't!

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:28.006
Spaghetti's divorce is not final.
This is bigamy.

01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:30.589
Not in Mexico it's not.
And his name is Rudolph.

01:01:31.547 --> 01:01:33.464
Oh... gavno!

01:01:35.422 --> 01:01:38.006
(Car engine starts)

01:01:42.631 --> 01:01:44.297
Hmm.

01:01:44.422 --> 01:01:46.547
(Screaming)

01:01:47.506 --> 01:01:51.297
(Swears in Russian) Let me go!

01:01:51.422 --> 01:01:53.547
Oh, get her in and shut up.

01:02:00.256 --> 01:02:03.089
Someone who hates us,
that's who did it.

01:02:03.214 --> 01:02:05.047
<i>Courva Nazimova.</i>

01:02:06.006 --> 01:02:09.131
You're not very lucky
in your choice of friends.

01:02:09.256 --> 01:02:13.006
You're not very lucky
with your wedding nights, are you?

01:02:25.256 --> 01:02:29.547
- June, are you there?
- Hi, George. What are you doing here?

01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:33.506
Look, I'm... I'm sorry to bother you,
but it's important.

01:02:33.631 --> 01:02:35.839
It must be to tear you away
from Sunday brunch.

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:38.547
- Rudy is in big trouble.
- What's the matter? Is he hurt?

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:41.131
No, no, no, nothing like that.
He's in jail.

01:02:41.256 --> 01:02:42.631
- Jail?
- Yes, in jail.

01:02:42.756 --> 01:02:44.964
The cops are holding him
on a bigamy charge.

01:02:45.089 --> 01:02:46.964
He and Natasha got antsy,
you see,

01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:49.506
so they skipped across the border
for a Mexican marriage

01:02:49.631 --> 01:02:51.339
and they got caught
on the way back.

01:02:51.464 --> 01:02:54.839
Now, June, if he's convicted,
it's good for one to five years,

01:02:54.964 --> 01:02:59.214
and the D.A. has set the bail
at $10,000 on a Sunday, the bastard!

01:02:59.339 --> 01:03:03.339
- Have you tried Lasky?
- Yes, yes, but he's not taking any calls.

01:03:03.464 --> 01:03:06.006
Then we'd better make a call on him -
in person.

01:03:06.131 --> 01:03:08.381
Ah, I've got my car right outside.

01:03:08.506 --> 01:03:12.422
Hurry. Hurry, George. We don't want them
to spend the night in jail.

01:03:19.339 --> 01:03:21.422
Afternoon, Mr Lasky.

01:03:21.547 --> 01:03:24.506
Er... it's very good of you to see us.

01:03:24.631 --> 01:03:27.381
Naturally it's pretty important,
or we'd never dream of bothering you.

01:03:27.506 --> 01:03:29.464
What are you doing about
getting Valentino out ofjail?

01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:30.631
Nothing.

01:03:30.756 --> 01:03:35.881
But he's your biggest star!
$10,000 is chicken feed to the studio.

01:03:36.006 --> 01:03:37.922
You made a fortune out of him.

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:40.131
Why spend $10,000 to get him out,

01:03:40.256 --> 01:03:44.047
when we're getting a million dollar's worth
of free publicity with him on the inside?

01:03:44.172 --> 01:03:46.172
How do I explain that to the stockholders?

01:03:46.297 --> 01:03:47.922
That's inhuman!

01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:51.172
Nonsense! It's strictly business.

01:03:51.297 --> 01:03:56.047
The more the press knocks the boy,
the bigger the box office. Goodbye.

01:03:57.547 --> 01:03:58.547
Goodbye, sir.

01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:00.214
(Whimpering)

01:04:00.339 --> 01:04:03.631
- And thanks anyway.
- You're welcome, I'm sure.

01:04:10.964 --> 01:04:14.506
He thinks more of that damned monkey
than he does of Rudy.

01:04:14.631 --> 01:04:17.089
A lousy ten grand!
Makes me wanna spit.

01:04:17.214 --> 01:04:18.964
Have you tried Natasha's father?

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:22.172
He's a big shot in the cosmetics business
or something, isn't he?

01:04:22.297 --> 01:04:25.381
Richard Hudnut, June,
is the cosmetics business.

01:04:25.506 --> 01:04:29.006
Well, he sprang for Natasha all right,
but bail for resisting arrest

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:31.547
isn't a hell of a lot more
than that guy drops in a restaurant,

01:04:31.672 --> 01:04:34.047
but Rudy he didn't want to know about.

01:04:34.172 --> 01:04:36.547
Damnit, I'd lay out the dough myself,
but I'm between pictures.

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:38.881
Well, I'm not between pictures.

01:04:39.006 --> 01:04:41.922
Call my Iawyerjust as soon as
the bank's open tomorrow, George.

01:04:42.047 --> 01:04:44.422
Hey June, come on,
you haven't got that kind of money.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.089
I've got a few buck tucked away.
what do you think I spend it on?

01:04:47.214 --> 01:04:48.922
Champagne, baths
and black silk formals?

01:04:49.047 --> 01:04:51.964
Just don't tell Rudy where it came from.
He'd never take it.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:55.339
Are you sure you won't change your mind
and come along? I know he'd appreciate it.

01:04:55.464 --> 01:04:57.547
Just drop me off at the studio, George.

01:04:57.672 --> 01:05:01.756
It's a shame that he won't know that you're
the one pal who pulled for him in a pinch.

01:05:01.881 --> 01:05:05.922
Oh, come on.
Cut the hearts and flowers, George.

01:05:06.047 --> 01:05:08.214
He's my bread and butter.

01:05:23.631 --> 01:05:25.631
(George) Rudy!

01:05:27.422 --> 01:05:28.839
They've got you in the tank.

01:05:28.964 --> 01:05:31.506
Thank God it's you, George.
I thought I would be here all night.

01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:33.839
I'm sorry, Rudy.
Natasha's out for $500,

01:05:33.964 --> 01:05:36.172
but your ten grand have been
too much of a stickler.

01:05:36.297 --> 01:05:38.506
What about Lasky? The studio?

01:05:38.631 --> 01:05:41.506
What can I say?
I guess they're scared of public opinion.

01:05:41.631 --> 01:05:45.839
A charge of bigamy is a lot more serious
than just er... biting a policeman.

01:05:45.964 --> 01:05:47.964
(Valentino) But I am legally divorced.

01:05:48.089 --> 01:05:49.922
(George) Not in California you're not.

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:53.547
In California it takes a year
for a divorce to become final.

01:05:53.672 --> 01:05:56.964
That's why we got married in Mexico
where they don't have that law.

01:05:57.089 --> 01:06:00.506
Well, ha ha, now you're back in California
where they do.

01:06:00.631 --> 01:06:02.089
OK, Natasha, come on.

01:06:02.214 --> 01:06:05.756
You're getting out of here,
but Rudy has to wait for the banks to open.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:09.339
Don't worry, Rudy.

01:06:09.464 --> 01:06:12.422
My stepfather will stand for bail.

01:06:12.547 --> 01:06:15.256
He owes it to you
for taking me off his hands.

01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:19.256
Please, Natasha.
I'd rather you didn't.

01:06:19.381 --> 01:06:21.631
Look, Rudy, I...

01:06:21.756 --> 01:06:23.506
Don't worry about it, OK?

01:06:23.631 --> 01:06:26.297
Worry? Worry about what, George?

01:06:26.422 --> 01:06:30.089
Nothing, nothing. OK, come on, Natasha,
let's get out of here.

01:06:33.297 --> 01:06:35.506
Take this in remembrance of me.

01:06:38.631 --> 01:06:40.506
Wear it always.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:52.214
I promise you most sacredly, my darling...

01:06:52.339 --> 01:06:53.756
Yes, my love?

01:06:54.672 --> 01:06:59.172
...l'll get that little worm Lasky for this
if it takes me the rest of my life.

01:07:02.214 --> 01:07:03.922
Chin up, Rudy.

01:07:04.047 --> 01:07:07.547
Come the dawn, you'll be as free as a bird.
Just keep holding your nose.

01:07:42.797 --> 01:07:46.839
Ah, here, lover boy.
Another nice, strong mug of coffee.

01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:50.881
- Thanks. Much obliged.
- You're welcome.

01:07:51.006 --> 01:07:54.672
I don't guess you was figuring on sleeping
too much tonight anyway, huh?

01:07:57.631 --> 01:07:59.672
Not a chance.

01:07:59.797 --> 01:08:02.089
That's some broad.

01:08:02.214 --> 01:08:05.714
Too bad we couldn't have obliged
with the honeymoon suite.

01:08:05.839 --> 01:08:08.881
It would've been quite an education
peeping through the bars.

01:08:09.006 --> 01:08:13.339
We'd have seen how much you got there
hanging between your legs.

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:16.671
The eight wonder of the world, they say.

01:08:16.796 --> 01:08:20.464
And <i>I'll</i> bet the blushing bride
could've showed us a trick or two.

01:08:20.589 --> 01:08:23.256
Leave her out of it.

01:08:26.506 --> 01:08:28.714
Now, that's a naughty boy.

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:30.839
Gonna have to teach him a lesson.

01:08:30.964 --> 01:08:34.964
Like er...
taking away his toilet privileges.

01:08:35.089 --> 01:08:36.339
<i>Stronzo! Merda!</i>

01:08:36.464 --> 01:08:37.671
Which is a shame

01:08:37.796 --> 01:08:40.881
because there was a little something
in that coffee you've been drinking all day

01:08:41.006 --> 01:08:43.046
to make you want to piss all night.
Hey, Willie.

01:08:43.171 --> 01:08:46.256
The world's greatest expert here tonight.

01:08:46.381 --> 01:08:50.881
Why don't you ask him for a few pointers
on split-tail anatomy?

01:08:52.839 --> 01:08:56.464
Poor Willie - he's been inside so long
he's forgotten what it looks like.

01:08:57.631 --> 01:09:00.839
Hey, Willie, say hello to the world's
greatest lover,

01:09:00.964 --> 01:09:04.131
Mr Rudolph Valentino.

01:09:15.756 --> 01:09:18.131
Give us a shake, Sheik.

01:09:18.256 --> 01:09:20.171
(Speaks Italian)

01:09:20.296 --> 01:09:24.339
And you'll never guess
it's his wedding night.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:31.006
Just stick it through the bars, Rudy,
and close your eyes,

01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:33.006
'cause you'll never know the difference.

01:09:33.131 --> 01:09:37.921
No kidding, Willie.
This guy has it ten times a day.

01:09:38.046 --> 01:09:40.421
The broads just throw themselves on it.

01:09:40.546 --> 01:09:42.171
Ten times a day, that's nothing.

01:09:42.296 --> 01:09:45.256
I get it twenty times.
Can you hear that? Twenty!

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:49.464
Once I had it twenty-four times.
Every hour on the hour.

01:09:49.589 --> 01:09:54.006
And I can draw it out,
make it one long fuck.

01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:57.464
That's what life should be about -
one long fuck.

01:09:57.589 --> 01:10:00.964
You gotta fuck them
before they fuck you, right?

01:10:01.089 --> 01:10:03.172
You gotta fuck them
before they fuck you.

01:10:07.547 --> 01:10:09.214
See, that's it, Willie boy!

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:11.506
Go fuck your fist!

01:10:12.131 --> 01:10:16.006
That's all you're gonna get
for the next twenty years, Willie.

01:10:22.631 --> 01:10:25.797
Hey, Chief,
kick the piss out of him.

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:30.131
Any minute now, fellas,
I'm gonna sell tickets! Ha-ha!

01:10:46.297 --> 01:10:50.381
Eh, what's the matter, Rudy?
You want a change of diaper?

01:10:50.506 --> 01:10:53.297
The eighth wonder of the world
needs a plumber.

01:10:58.172 --> 01:11:00.297
(lndistinct)

01:11:06.381 --> 01:11:08.839
(lndistinct)

01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:39.506
Come on, come on, clear off the street.
Keep that street clear.

01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:41.839
(lndistinct shouting)

01:11:46.797 --> 01:11:49.964
Natasha, Rudy, my children.

01:11:51.464 --> 01:11:55.339
How you must have suffered. I moved
heaven and earth to get you out of there.

01:11:55.464 --> 01:11:59.922
I was just reading the judge's summing up.
Seems it was all a mistake anyway.

01:12:00.047 --> 01:12:03.214
Mexican laws aren't recognised
in the State of California.

01:12:03.339 --> 01:12:06.797
So, the ceremony was null and void.

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:09.547
- Neither was the marriage consummated.
- So I read.

01:12:09.672 --> 01:12:12.922
- The prison bars got in the way.
- I'm truly sorry.

01:12:13.047 --> 01:12:15.756
But now that's all over and forgotten.

01:12:15.881 --> 01:12:18.381
Let's get down to the reason
I asked you to come and see me.

01:12:18.506 --> 01:12:19.839
Then we'll talk Son Of The Sheik.

01:12:19.964 --> 01:12:22.547
And while you're at it,
why not Grandson Of The Sheik?

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:27.006
I'm happy to say that the board of directors
have just given the nod

01:12:27.131 --> 01:12:31.047
to a little pet project of mine that's been
in the works for some time now, Rudy,

01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:32.797
namely a raise for yours truly.

01:12:33.506 --> 01:12:35.256
We're not interested in a raise,

01:12:35.381 --> 01:12:37.589
we're interested in
double our present salaries.

01:12:38.797 --> 01:12:42.256
It would be most appreciated
if you could make yourself available

01:12:42.381 --> 01:12:45.131
for make-up test and costume fittings
on Monday.

01:12:45.256 --> 01:12:50.089
We're not interested in trying on
any new turbans just now, thank you.

01:12:50.214 --> 01:12:53.131
Nor are we interested in pictures
which debase our talent.

01:12:53.256 --> 01:12:56.172
This "we" we insist upon over-using,
Miss Hudnut,

01:12:56.297 --> 01:12:59.631
this is editorial, or do we now think
we're the Queen of Sheba?

01:13:01.297 --> 01:13:03.714
From now on, I want script approval.

01:13:03.839 --> 01:13:05.464
(Chuckles)

01:13:05.589 --> 01:13:09.047
That's ridiculous, Rudy.
Nobody gets script approval.

01:13:09.172 --> 01:13:11.672
Fairbanks and Pickford
get script approval.

01:13:11.797 --> 01:13:15.006
But they own their own studio.
They are United Artists.

01:13:15.881 --> 01:13:20.214
Artists, huh! A bunch of phoney curls
and a muscle-bound moustache.

01:13:20.339 --> 01:13:21.964
He's a bigger star than both of them.

01:13:22.089 --> 01:13:26.006
He, until a few short years ago,
was a two-bit dancehall gigolo.

01:13:26.131 --> 01:13:29.339
If it wasn't for me,
you would be bankrupt.

01:13:29.464 --> 01:13:31.839
I made you millions,
and you offer me trash.

01:13:32.589 --> 01:13:35.089
Unless you honour
the spirit of my contract,

01:13:35.214 --> 01:13:37.506
I will be compelled
to find work elsewhere.

01:13:37.631 --> 01:13:41.964
The only work you'll find, young man,
is waiting on tables in some spaghetti joint.

01:13:42.089 --> 01:13:44.256
Your contract here
is two more years to go,

01:13:44.381 --> 01:13:47.506
and if you so much as take a pratfall
in a Mexican two-reeler,

01:13:47.631 --> 01:13:50.256
I'm gonna slap an injunction
on your little Italian ass.

01:13:51.131 --> 01:13:52.922
Well, we could use the vacation.

01:13:53.047 --> 01:13:54.381
Vacation, huh?

01:13:54.506 --> 01:13:56.797
Two years off the screen,
and he'll be dead and buried.

01:13:57.589 --> 01:14:00.506
To my public I will never die,

01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:03.422
and when Valentino returns,

01:14:03.547 --> 01:14:06.256
he will not reward their loyalty
with rubbish.

01:14:06.714 --> 01:14:09.256
<i>Ne crachez pas en /'air.</i>

01:14:09.381 --> 01:14:13.631
I warn you! You'll never work again,
you meatball!

01:14:20.339 --> 01:14:22.381
(Bird squawks)

01:14:24.964 --> 01:14:28.756
(Valentino) You are the spirit
that moves the universe,

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:32.006
the songs that wakes the day,

01:14:32.131 --> 01:14:35.214
the waves that soothe the sand,

01:14:35.339 --> 01:14:38.881
the giving hand, the magic of a touch,

01:14:40.089 --> 01:14:43.256
the peace of afterglow,

01:14:43.381 --> 01:14:45.506
the mystery of night,

01:14:45.631 --> 01:14:47.547
the promise of delight.

01:14:47.672 --> 01:14:50.214
You make me sound like a shopping list.

01:14:51.714 --> 01:14:53.714
The thrill of surrender,

01:14:53.839 --> 01:14:56.422
the fount of all pleasure,

01:14:56.547 --> 01:14:58.881
the power of religion,

01:14:59.006 --> 01:15:01.839
my meaning for existence,

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.714
my vision of heaven,

01:15:03.839 --> 01:15:05.506
my life eternal,

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:07.297
my love,

01:15:07.422 --> 01:15:09.339
my friend.

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.756
Pure doggerel, darling,

01:15:12.881 --> 01:15:15.089
but I like the sentiment.

01:15:15.214 --> 01:15:18.881
Then you must help me
turn it into poetry.

01:15:20.589 --> 01:15:22.381
We'll work on it after lunch.

01:15:23.631 --> 01:15:25.714
I think we'll have to set another place.

01:15:29.589 --> 01:15:31.506
I fear it is a newspaper man.

01:15:32.631 --> 01:15:34.672
Do you think
we ought to make a run for it?

01:15:36.047 --> 01:15:38.506
There's nowhere left to run to.

01:15:44.547 --> 01:15:46.881
Good morning. George Ullman.

01:15:49.006 --> 01:15:50.881
I represent Mineralava Toiletries.

01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:53.506
Well, we haven't got a cent between us.

01:15:53.631 --> 01:15:56.506
- I hope you've got some free samples.
- Oh, you betcha.

01:15:57.797 --> 01:16:00.756
Although I don't think your lady here
is in need of them, Mr Valentino.

01:16:00.881 --> 01:16:03.756
Natasha, a fan.

01:16:03.881 --> 01:16:06.714
Oh, yes, sir.
I've seen all your films.

01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:11.922
<i>Four Horsemen, Blood and Sand,
The Sheik.</i>

01:16:12.047 --> 01:16:14.131
Of course, I haven't seen one
in quite a while.

01:16:15.089 --> 01:16:17.006
In along while.

01:16:19.631 --> 01:16:21.964
Over a year now.

01:16:22.506 --> 01:16:25.589
And we've never been happier
in our lives.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:28.006
Mrs Crusoe and Robinson.

01:16:28.131 --> 01:16:29.922
Our own island.

01:16:30.047 --> 01:16:32.297
Who needs Man Friday?

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:36.006
No one who'd settle
for sand and seaweed soup.

01:16:37.172 --> 01:16:39.547
I know about you
losing your suit with Lasky.

01:16:39.672 --> 01:16:42.172
I also know you owe your lawyers
$50,000,

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.339
money which you could
very well use right now.

01:16:44.464 --> 01:16:46.797
But I guess that's beside the point.

01:16:46.922 --> 01:16:48.797
The press has been saying
that you're washed up,

01:16:48.922 --> 01:16:51.256
but I think differently. My card.

01:16:52.256 --> 01:16:54.506
Mineralava Toiletries.
He's not kidding.

01:16:54.631 --> 01:16:58.089
Oh, no, ma'am. We have the largest range
of ladies' aids and beauty clays

01:16:58.214 --> 01:16:59.672
in the Continental U.S. -

01:16:59.797 --> 01:17:02.756
save of course for Richard Hudnut
Cosmetics, Miss Hudnut.

01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:06.839
I am not Miss Hudnut.
I'm Natasha Rambova.

01:17:06.964 --> 01:17:10.381
And soon she will be Mrs Valentino...
again.

01:17:10.506 --> 01:17:11.756
Beg your pardon.

01:17:11.881 --> 01:17:13.672
All the same, Miss Rambova,

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:16.339
I don't think your father'd like you
even looking at that card.

01:17:16.464 --> 01:17:18.964
There's one thing
you should learn about me right now.

01:17:19.089 --> 01:17:22.381
My stepfather's opinion is of little
consequence to me, Mr, er...

01:17:22.506 --> 01:17:24.172
Ullman. Good.

01:17:24.297 --> 01:17:27.714
Does that mean then that you won't
reject my proposition on those grounds?

01:17:27.839 --> 01:17:29.422
Just what is your proposition?

01:17:29.547 --> 01:17:32.506
Undertaking a tour.
The stages of America.

01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:36.506
Mr and Mrs Rudolph Valentino.
An exercise in interpretive dance,

01:17:36.631 --> 01:17:39.131
with a few kind words thrown in
for the product as the finale.

01:17:39.256 --> 01:17:42.214
Vaudeville!
You must be out of your mind.

01:17:42.339 --> 01:17:45.006
Huh! She must've been talking
to the people over at Mineralava,

01:17:45.131 --> 01:17:46.839
'cause that's exactly what they said.

01:17:46.964 --> 01:17:49.214
"Stick to booking dog acts in Vaudeville."

01:17:49.339 --> 01:17:51.756
Do you expect me to appear in Vaudeville?

01:17:51.881 --> 01:17:56.172
I who have danced with Vladimir Kosloff
and before the crowned heads of Europe?

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:58.839
- Anna Pavlova did.
- Pavlova, huh!

01:17:58.964 --> 01:18:02.297
- We're artists, not acrobats.
- You're also broke.

01:18:02.422 --> 01:18:05.839
Look, I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in the perfume business

01:18:05.964 --> 01:18:08.506
any more than you want to spend yours
here on the rocks.

01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:11.297
I'd like to take you over, manage you.
To prove my potential,

01:18:11.422 --> 01:18:15.422
I've already convinced Mineralava
to cough up $7,500 a week.

01:18:15.547 --> 01:18:18.297
Now, that's more
than you ever made in movies.

01:18:18.422 --> 01:18:19.964
Total artistic control?

01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:23.339
Took the words right out of my mouth.

01:18:23.839 --> 01:18:25.422
Thirsty?

01:18:27.547 --> 01:18:30.089
What about Lasky's injunction?

01:18:30.214 --> 01:18:32.756
I can't perform for anyone but him.

01:18:32.881 --> 01:18:35.297
That injunction only covers acting.

01:18:35.422 --> 01:18:37.589
Not a word in there about dancing.

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:39.922
Are you positive?

01:18:40.047 --> 01:18:42.964
My lawyers checked it out.
Are you thirsty?

01:18:43.089 --> 01:18:44.964
Natasha, what do you think?

01:18:46.631 --> 01:18:49.214
I just don't know, Rudolph.

01:18:53.131 --> 01:18:55.506
What's she doing now?

01:18:55.631 --> 01:18:58.172
Consulting our present business manager.

01:18:58.297 --> 01:19:00.339
What does he say?

01:19:00.464 --> 01:19:02.589
Meselope says he's thirsty.

01:19:05.631 --> 01:19:08.547
Great! Wonderful!

01:19:13.089 --> 01:19:15.172
(J' Orchestra plays jaunty tune)

01:20:01.006 --> 01:20:02.714
(J' Music stops)

01:20:16.172 --> 01:20:18.589
Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:29.006 --> 01:20:31.006
Thank you.
Just one moment, please.

01:20:31.131 --> 01:20:33.672
On behalf of my wife and myself,
I would...

01:20:34.339 --> 01:20:35.672
One moment.

01:20:38.422 --> 01:20:40.089
Thank you.

01:20:42.381 --> 01:20:46.214
On behalf of my wife, Natasha,
and myself,

01:20:46.339 --> 01:20:48.506
I would like to thank you
for the great ovation.

01:20:49.964 --> 01:20:53.714
In the <i>53</i> cities we have
so far visited on our tour,

01:20:53.839 --> 01:20:57.339
this is the warmest reception
we have ever received.

01:21:06.881 --> 01:21:10.297
I would also like to thank
the makers of Mineralava

01:21:10.422 --> 01:21:13.131
who made possible
our appearance here tonight.

01:21:14.339 --> 01:21:16.506
And talking about appearances,

01:21:16.631 --> 01:21:20.672
my wife owes her lovely complexion

01:21:20.797 --> 01:21:24.006
solely to Mineralava beauty clay,

01:21:24.131 --> 01:21:27.589
nature's answer to all skin problems.

01:21:27.714 --> 01:21:31.547
I prefer Mineralava
to all other beauty products,

01:21:31.672 --> 01:21:33.506
including Daddy's.

01:21:54.839 --> 01:21:56.256
Bravo!

01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:01.172
Typical!
Always biting the hand that fed her.

01:22:01.297 --> 01:22:03.839
Excuse me, sir, but you have
to keep your remarks to yourself,

01:22:03.964 --> 01:22:06.089
or else leave the theatre.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:11.297
Lasky? I didn't recognise you.

01:22:11.797 --> 01:22:14.631
No reason why you should, Ullman.
We've never met.

01:22:18.422 --> 01:22:20.714
(J' Orchestra strikes up)

01:22:28.464 --> 01:22:31.172
I want you to break his contract
with Mineralava.

01:22:31.297 --> 01:22:33.797
You won't be the loser by it.

01:22:33.922 --> 01:22:35.922
<i>L'll</i> pretend you didn't say that, OK?

01:22:36.047 --> 01:22:38.797
What's wrong?
You represent him now, don't you?

01:22:38.922 --> 01:22:41.547
I was referring to your agent's fee.

01:22:41.672 --> 01:22:44.881
- Well, you know his terms.
- Hers, you mean.

01:22:45.006 --> 01:22:48.839
$10,000 a week,
his own chauffeur-driven limousine,

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.381
and <i>I'll</i> even throw in a bungalow
on the lot.

01:22:51.506 --> 01:22:54.047
Gee, that even sounds reasonable.

01:22:54.172 --> 01:22:56.131
But the final decision
doesn't rest with me.

01:22:56.256 --> 01:22:58.297
You mean Mrs Valentino?

01:22:58.422 --> 01:23:00.464
That's why I'm giving them
script approval

01:23:00.589 --> 01:23:04.172
and putting her on the payroll
as artistic advisor.

01:23:04.297 --> 01:23:05.964
Well, there's someone else to consult.

01:23:06.089 --> 01:23:09.131
What? Well, whoever it is,
let me talk to him and fast.

01:23:09.256 --> 01:23:12.714
Mr Lasky, I don't think
you'd want to do that.

01:23:12.839 --> 01:23:15.214
What are you talking about?
Why wouldn't I want to do that?

01:23:15.339 --> 01:23:18.589
You see, he's been dead 4,000 years.

01:23:18.714 --> 01:23:21.089
Oh, the Goddamn bones.

01:23:23.297 --> 01:23:27.172
Remember, darling,
you're the greatest lover in all Europe.

01:23:27.297 --> 01:23:30.089
Forget you're from the Bronx.
You're a Countess.

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.964
Swoon, Lorna, swoon.

01:23:32.089 --> 01:23:34.714
More restraint, Rudy,
more restraint!

01:23:34.839 --> 01:23:37.547
Run your hands through his hair.

01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:39.964
Don't muss his hair!

01:23:40.089 --> 01:23:43.422
- Flutter your eyelids.
- Just a flicker of a smile, darling.

01:23:43.547 --> 01:23:46.547
- Roll your eyes.
- That's it, Rudy. No.

01:23:46.672 --> 01:23:47.714
- More.
- Less.

01:23:47.839 --> 01:23:49.047
- More!
- Less!

01:23:49.172 --> 01:23:51.131
Now close your eyes.

01:23:51.256 --> 01:23:53.464
Roll your eyes, damn you.

01:23:54.256 --> 01:23:57.089
Pant, Lorna, pant.

01:23:57.214 --> 01:23:59.214
Still, Rudy, don't breathe.

01:23:59.339 --> 01:24:00.881
Now roll your head.

01:24:01.006 --> 01:24:03.381
- (Moans)
- (Natasha) Perfectly still!

01:24:03.506 --> 01:24:05.547
You are going to die, Lorna.

01:24:05.672 --> 01:24:08.297
(Natasha) Now brush her cheeks
with your lips.

01:24:08.422 --> 01:24:10.547
(Sidney) Start closing your eyes.

01:24:10.672 --> 01:24:13.089
(Natasha) Start opening your eyes.

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:15.006
(Sidney) Die of love.

01:24:15.131 --> 01:24:16.297
Look at her cynically.

01:24:16.422 --> 01:24:18.922
(Sidney) Die of ecstasy.
(Natasha) More cynically.

01:24:19.047 --> 01:24:22.464
- More still.
- Are you ready for it?

01:24:22.589 --> 01:24:26.631
- Stand by now.
- Stand by... kiss!

01:24:28.422 --> 01:24:31.881
Do you think she tells him
what to do in bed?

01:24:34.214 --> 01:24:39.214
Do you think we could say "out" now?
Cut!

01:24:43.214 --> 01:24:45.839
- (Gasping)
- A powder puff.

01:24:45.964 --> 01:24:47.422
Who did that?

01:24:48.297 --> 01:24:50.631
Get Lasky.

01:24:50.756 --> 01:24:53.131
That was damn silly, eh, Rudy?

01:24:53.256 --> 01:24:56.381
Are you still there?
Where are you?

01:24:56.506 --> 01:24:57.756
Come down.

01:24:57.881 --> 01:25:02.756
Will the perpetrator
of that childish prank own up?

01:25:02.881 --> 01:25:05.172
I'd like to see what kind of man he is.

01:25:05.839 --> 01:25:07.631
Whoever the jerk is...

01:25:08.839 --> 01:25:09.881
...he's yellow.

01:25:10.631 --> 01:25:13.256
Whoever he is,
<i>I'll</i> fight him here and now.

01:25:13.381 --> 01:25:16.547
Lorna's right. He's yellow.
He's not worth bothering about.

01:25:16.672 --> 01:25:18.214
Let's get back to work.

01:25:18.339 --> 01:25:21.089
There will be no more shooting
on Valentino

01:25:21.214 --> 01:25:23.964
unless the culprit owns up.

01:25:24.089 --> 01:25:25.714
(Lasky) What's going on now, Natasha?

01:25:25.839 --> 01:25:27.964
Another make-up problem?

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:31.547
Someone dropped this on Rudy
from the rails.

01:25:31.672 --> 01:25:35.006
A pink powder puff-
who would do a thing like that?

01:25:35.131 --> 01:25:36.797
Unless the guilty person

01:25:36.922 --> 01:25:40.797
or persons responsible
for this thoughtless act owns up,

01:25:40.922 --> 01:25:43.881
there will be no more shooting
on Valentino today.

01:25:44.006 --> 01:25:47.089
Nobody's going to own up,
because nobody wants to get fired.

01:25:47.214 --> 01:25:51.797
Hey, Jesse, if you ask me,
that sounds like victimisation.

01:25:51.922 --> 01:25:55.631
If you want to be fair about this thing,
fire everybody.

01:25:56.922 --> 01:26:01.047
I don't want anybody fired.
I just want to fight them.

01:26:03.589 --> 01:26:05.881
I give my solemn promise

01:26:06.006 --> 01:26:11.547
that if the person or persons
responsible for this thoughtless act

01:26:11.672 --> 01:26:15.297
steps forward here and now
and apologises,

01:26:15.422 --> 01:26:19.756
the apology will be accepted
and no further action taken.

01:26:54.672 --> 01:26:56.547
Natasha, I must go back in there.

01:26:56.672 --> 01:26:59.131
Huh! That'll look funny -
you just walked out.

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:01.172
Because I love you.

01:27:01.714 --> 01:27:03.922
They're tearing us apart.

01:27:04.047 --> 01:27:07.339
Why can't it be like it was before?

01:27:07.464 --> 01:27:10.631
It will be. It will be.

01:27:10.756 --> 01:27:14.131
After this one we can say goodbye
to Lasky forever.

01:27:14.256 --> 01:27:16.131
United Artists?

01:27:16.256 --> 01:27:17.881
George just fixed a deal.

01:27:18.006 --> 01:27:21.922
He's coming over to the house
this afternoon with the contracts.

01:27:22.047 --> 01:27:24.089
Well, that's what you've always wanted.

01:27:24.214 --> 01:27:27.381
Oh, darling, all I've ever wanted
is to work beyond the reach

01:27:27.506 --> 01:27:30.589
of every hamfist with a key
to the screening room.

01:27:30.714 --> 01:27:32.839
<i>I'll</i> be the production designer,

01:27:32.964 --> 01:27:34.214
the writer,

01:27:34.339 --> 01:27:36.131
the director.

01:27:36.256 --> 01:27:38.506
You'll play the part of your life.

01:27:38.631 --> 01:27:41.589
A dark-skinned moor, bearded,

01:27:41.714 --> 01:27:44.464
a sort of intellectual Othello.

01:27:44.589 --> 01:27:48.714
The Fa/con will be the perfect film
because it will be the work of one person:

01:27:48.839 --> 01:27:50.089
Us!

01:27:50.214 --> 01:27:52.131
That's wonderful, dear.

01:27:52.256 --> 01:27:54.839
But now I must go back inside there

01:27:54.964 --> 01:27:57.089
or forever lose my self-respect.

01:27:57.214 --> 01:27:59.297
Self-respect?

01:27:59.422 --> 01:28:01.589
I call it vanity.

01:28:01.714 --> 01:28:03.881
But if you really want to win
the respect of the crew,

01:28:04.006 --> 01:28:06.589
you'd better screw that little whore Lorna.

01:28:08.547 --> 01:28:11.047
And make sure everybody knows about it.

01:28:19.881 --> 01:28:22.256
(Man) Hey! Come back here, you.

01:28:22.381 --> 01:28:23.589
Hey, come here.

01:28:23.714 --> 01:28:25.714
- Rudy!
- OK, little lady, are you coming quietly...

01:28:25.839 --> 01:28:28.381
- Rudy!
- ...or do I have to slug you?

01:28:28.506 --> 01:28:31.964
I'm the President of the Santa Monica
fan club. Rudy's expecting me.

01:28:32.089 --> 01:28:34.089
I've got a letter. I'm invited.

01:28:34.214 --> 01:28:36.839
Not in his private bungalow, you're not.

01:28:36.964 --> 01:28:40.881
- Oh, Rudy!
- Let go of that door I say!

01:28:43.464 --> 01:28:47.506
That Marsha's crazy about you.
What's she like?

01:28:47.631 --> 01:28:49.256
I've never met her.

01:28:49.381 --> 01:28:51.464
Oh, yeah?

01:28:51.589 --> 01:28:53.547
Honestly and truly.

01:28:53.672 --> 01:28:57.631
Like you truly wanted to rehearse
the love scene in the lunch break?

01:29:02.256 --> 01:29:04.797
Oh... I never dreamed
that this could happen.

01:29:04.922 --> 01:29:07.047
I mean, with all the women
that you must have,

01:29:07.172 --> 01:29:09.256
not to mention your wife, I mean.

01:29:09.381 --> 01:29:11.797
You know, I'm not gonna accept
another date all week,

01:29:11.922 --> 01:29:13.922
just so I can lie in bed
and remember this.

01:29:14.047 --> 01:29:16.922
All the others will just be silly memories.

01:29:18.589 --> 01:29:21.797
I just won't be able to stop thinking
about this moment.

01:29:21.922 --> 01:29:24.506
Confess. Have there been
many others, Lorna?

01:29:25.547 --> 01:29:27.547
They don't count.

01:29:30.214 --> 01:29:32.589
I often dream of you

01:29:32.714 --> 01:29:35.089
when I'm with another man.

01:29:40.506 --> 01:29:44.589
It doesn't bother you, does it,
the other men I mean?

01:29:44.714 --> 01:29:47.631
All women are meant to be loved, Lorna.

01:29:48.339 --> 01:29:49.964
You've just been getting too much.

01:29:50.089 --> 01:29:52.714
All those starlets
and God knows how many fans.

01:29:52.839 --> 01:29:54.422
Not to mention your wife.

01:29:54.547 --> 01:29:56.297
Hurt me. Don't be gentle.

01:29:56.422 --> 01:29:58.547
Imagine you're the Sheik
on your big white stallion,

01:29:58.672 --> 01:30:00.964
crushing life out of me in your arms.

01:30:01.089 --> 01:30:03.756
Don't be gentle. Hurt me.

01:30:03.881 --> 01:30:05.756
Do something.

01:30:05.881 --> 01:30:09.256
Look! Look! Look!
It's the desert.

01:30:09.381 --> 01:30:10.881
Close your eyes.

01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:13.214
Trust me, honey,
I've been over this a thousand times.

01:30:15.506 --> 01:30:17.256
It's the desert.

01:30:17.381 --> 01:30:19.839
Merciless, blazing sun.

01:30:19.964 --> 01:30:22.339
Heatwaves shimmying
from the purple dunes.

01:30:22.464 --> 01:30:24.047
My lip is rimmed with sweat.

01:30:24.172 --> 01:30:26.297
- Perspiration. Excuse me.
- You're welcome.

01:30:26.422 --> 01:30:29.422
The clothes are sticking to the contours
of my damp body.

01:30:29.547 --> 01:30:31.964
You come riding up.
You reach down,

01:30:32.089 --> 01:30:35.547
and with one bronzed, rippling arm
scoop me into the saddle.

01:30:35.672 --> 01:30:37.506
Faster and faster we ride.

01:30:37.631 --> 01:30:39.672
Your strong hands
tear my limp bodice to shreds.

01:30:42.464 --> 01:30:44.797
Steel fingers groping my thighs,

01:30:44.922 --> 01:30:46.714
pawing at my swollen breasts,

01:30:47.672 --> 01:30:51.464
plunging it into me now
with a sharp crack of leather

01:30:51.589 --> 01:30:53.464
as the riding whip cuts into my flesh.

01:30:54.256 --> 01:30:58.172
Thundering hooves
and groaning leather

01:30:58.297 --> 01:31:00.672
until... Rudy...

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:03.839
Rudy! Rudy!

01:31:05.089 --> 01:31:06.422
Alas!

01:31:08.381 --> 01:31:11.547
I am... spent.

01:31:15.172 --> 01:31:16.922
Oh...

01:31:17.047 --> 01:31:19.089
Rudy!

01:31:19.214 --> 01:31:23.006
You were so wonderful.
I think I'm gonna die.

01:31:23.131 --> 01:31:27.172
Not now, Lorna.
We're going to be late for work.

01:31:32.422 --> 01:31:34.214
Well, Sidney.

01:31:34.339 --> 01:31:37.422
- Well, Rudy?
- Let's go.

01:31:37.547 --> 01:31:39.756
Aren't we waiting on Mrs Valentino?

01:31:39.881 --> 01:31:41.089
No.

01:31:42.422 --> 01:31:44.172
- Let's go.
- That's great.

01:31:44.297 --> 01:31:46.256
We can pick it up
from where we left off.

01:31:46.381 --> 01:31:48.881
You hear a noise behind the door,
and you get off...

01:31:49.006 --> 01:31:53.089
No! Let's do the love scene
all over again.

01:31:53.214 --> 01:31:55.089
It was far too mechanical,

01:31:55.214 --> 01:32:00.464
and I think Lorna and I
can improve on it now.

01:32:00.589 --> 01:32:02.756
We sure could, lover.

01:32:02.881 --> 01:32:05.631
Maestro, make with the music.

01:32:05.756 --> 01:32:07.381
<i>E mo/to appassionata!</i>

01:32:10.547 --> 01:32:11.547
Action!

01:32:11.672 --> 01:32:14.256
(J' PYOTR ILYICH TCHAIKOVSKY:
Overture from "Romeo And Juliet")

01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:16.047
Natasha!

01:33:16.172 --> 01:33:18.131
What's the matter?

01:33:19.339 --> 01:33:20.964
It's not over Lorna, is it?

01:33:23.381 --> 01:33:25.422
The U.A. contract.

01:33:25.547 --> 01:33:28.089
George was spelling out
the small print.

01:33:28.214 --> 01:33:31.714
That's a very good deal, Rudy.
It's half a million dollars a year.

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:35.131
And I'm not even allowed
past the studio gates.

01:33:35.256 --> 01:33:37.839
- The bastards!
- Natasha, for God's sakes!

01:33:37.964 --> 01:33:40.422
They're merely saying
that your presence won't be required

01:33:40.547 --> 01:33:42.547
during any stage of the production.
That's all.

01:33:42.672 --> 01:33:43.881
But that's impossible!

01:33:44.006 --> 01:33:48.256
Damnit, Rudy, I've been fighting it
for weeks! Now U.A. is adamant.

01:33:51.172 --> 01:33:54.839
We don't need United Artists.
We don't need anyone.

01:33:54.964 --> 01:33:57.714
We'll make The Fa/con ourselves.

01:33:57.839 --> 01:33:59.339
Without his help.

01:33:59.464 --> 01:34:01.964
<i>E ora basta!</i>

01:34:03.756 --> 01:34:06.547
Well, if you were to mortgage this house,
these art treasures,

01:34:06.672 --> 01:34:10.797
your cars, and all your horses,
you'd still be a million dollars short.

01:34:10.922 --> 01:34:13.131
You should have stuck to Vaudeville!

01:34:13.256 --> 01:34:15.964
You're nothing but a small-time hustler

01:34:16.089 --> 01:34:19.172
who's mismanaged our affairs
from the start.

01:34:20.339 --> 01:34:23.422
Now it's perfectly obvious
you're trying to break up our marriage.

01:34:23.547 --> 01:34:27.547
You wanted the U.A. deal in the first place.
We were damn lucky to get it.

01:34:27.672 --> 01:34:30.589
There's not a producer in this town
who'll let you on his set.

01:34:30.714 --> 01:34:32.714
Those are the people
who built this business.

01:34:32.839 --> 01:34:35.381
And they're not gonna let a woman
tell them how to run it.

01:34:35.506 --> 01:34:39.381
She wanted a clause giving her the right
to play the female lead... even direct!

01:34:40.256 --> 01:34:43.547
We were doing fine
until she started howling for the moon.

01:34:48.964 --> 01:34:50.881
(Door slams shut)

01:35:12.672 --> 01:35:15.214
Hollywood's killing me.
You know that, don't you?

01:35:16.672 --> 01:35:19.131
After Beaucaire
there's nothing to keep us here.

01:35:20.672 --> 01:35:23.422
Ajug of wine, a book of verse,

01:35:23.547 --> 01:35:26.131
thou beside me in the wilderness.

01:35:26.256 --> 01:35:27.964
I'm too old for beach-combing.

01:35:28.964 --> 01:35:31.714
Beach?
You can't grow anything on a beach.

01:35:31.839 --> 01:35:35.797
- What do you mean?
- I've still got my diploma of agriculture.

01:35:35.922 --> 01:35:38.964
What's to stop us
getting that orange grove?

01:35:39.089 --> 01:35:41.839
Produce the Valentino
Seedless Navel together?

01:35:45.422 --> 01:35:49.214
I would hope that destiny
had promised us a richer fate than that.

01:35:50.964 --> 01:35:52.297
But...

01:35:53.672 --> 01:35:55.506
...we shall see.

01:36:02.547 --> 01:36:05.672
Meselope, what is our destiny to be?

01:36:07.006 --> 01:36:09.964
Are we to seek new horizons
for our endeavours?

01:36:13.839 --> 01:36:16.339
Are we to continue working together?

01:36:19.547 --> 01:36:24.714
We're to stay in films
but work separately?

01:36:24.839 --> 01:36:26.172
Yes?

01:36:27.172 --> 01:36:31.381
- (Crowd outside) You...
- ...are the spirit that moves the universe.

01:36:31.506 --> 01:36:34.964
- You...
- ...are the song that makes the day.

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:38.547
- You...
- ...are the waves that soothe the sand.

01:36:38.672 --> 01:36:41.714
- You...
- ...are the giving hand.

01:36:41.839 --> 01:36:44.631
- You...
- ...are the magic of a touch.

01:36:44.756 --> 01:36:46.964
- You...
- ...are the peace...

01:36:47.089 --> 01:36:48.631
Quick, before it's too late!

01:36:48.756 --> 01:36:51.922
- You...
- ...are the mystery of night.

01:36:52.047 --> 01:36:53.339
You...

01:36:53.464 --> 01:36:55.297
Are we to work together?

01:36:55.422 --> 01:36:56.589
You...

01:36:58.839 --> 01:37:02.006
Are we to remain together working?

01:37:03.506 --> 01:37:06.506
Are we? Are we?

01:37:07.047 --> 01:37:08.089
You...

01:37:10.214 --> 01:37:11.256
Are we?

01:37:12.714 --> 01:37:15.547
Shall we be together?

01:37:15.672 --> 01:37:19.464
Yes! Of course we shall, Natasha.
Please, stop.

01:37:21.464 --> 01:37:22.506
You...

01:37:22.631 --> 01:37:25.547
Please! Free us!

01:37:25.672 --> 01:37:27.422
Release us.

01:37:28.672 --> 01:37:30.047
Let us go.

01:37:31.214 --> 01:37:33.297
Let us go.

01:37:33.422 --> 01:37:36.422
Natasha, please stop!

01:37:36.547 --> 01:37:38.464
(Screams)

01:37:44.172 --> 01:37:45.839
You...

01:37:45.964 --> 01:37:48.881
...are the power of religion.

01:37:49.006 --> 01:37:50.047
You...

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:53.714
Natasha! Think about us!

01:37:53.839 --> 01:37:57.631
"Us"? It's not "us", it's you.

01:37:57.756 --> 01:38:00.589
Listen to them.
They think you're God.

01:38:00.714 --> 01:38:03.006
Can't you just forget them?

01:38:03.131 --> 01:38:05.964
Not any more than they
could forget about you.

01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:09.297
<i>- L'll</i> quit. I promise.
- Quit?

01:38:09.422 --> 01:38:13.172
It's gone too far for that.
You're not going anywhere.

01:38:13.297 --> 01:38:15.172
Listen to them!

01:38:15.297 --> 01:38:19.006
- You...
- ...are the thrill of surrender.

01:38:19.131 --> 01:38:23.839
- You...
- ...are the fount of all pleasure.

01:38:24.756 --> 01:38:27.881
I could show them. I could make a film.

01:38:28.006 --> 01:38:31.381
That's it!
Who cares what Meselope says?

01:38:31.506 --> 01:38:33.547
We'll do it together, just like before.

01:38:33.672 --> 01:38:37.797
- No! I could make a film.
- Fine, fine.

01:38:37.922 --> 01:38:39.881
<i>L'll</i> arrange anything you need.

01:38:40.006 --> 01:38:42.547
I just want us to be together.

01:38:42.672 --> 01:38:45.422
It'll be all right.
We'll be together.

01:38:45.547 --> 01:38:48.631
Just as soon as
who they think you are is gone -

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.506
then we can be together forever.

01:38:50.631 --> 01:38:53.589
But we are together now.
Natasha, please.

01:38:53.714 --> 01:38:57.047
- You...
- ...are my vision of heaven.

01:38:57.172 --> 01:39:00.881
<i>I'll</i> turn their heaven into hell.

01:39:01.006 --> 01:39:04.089
- You...
- ...are the food of love.

01:39:05.006 --> 01:39:07.589
<i>L'll</i> ruin their appetite for it.

01:39:07.714 --> 01:39:11.589
- You...
- ...are the dream that intoxicates.

01:39:13.256 --> 01:39:16.589
<i>L'll</i> slap them sober with the truth.

01:39:16.714 --> 01:39:20.506
Natasha, please. Do you love me?

01:39:20.631 --> 01:39:24.256
Just say you love me.

01:39:24.381 --> 01:39:27.172
You love me.

01:39:27.297 --> 01:39:29.381
Jesus Christ!

01:39:32.131 --> 01:39:33.964
Aren't you just?

01:39:37.922 --> 01:39:41.797
- You...
- ...are my life eternal.

01:39:41.922 --> 01:39:47.214
- You...
- ...are my friend, my love.

01:39:51.381 --> 01:39:54.547
(Natasha)
The winds of destiny tore us apart

01:39:54.672 --> 01:39:58.422
and drove us along different paths.

01:40:00.172 --> 01:40:04.339
But though his lips
will never touch mine again...

01:40:05.756 --> 01:40:09.922
...I can still embrace his spirit
through Meselope.

01:40:12.256 --> 01:40:14.547
Don't worry, me/yushka.

01:40:14.672 --> 01:40:17.672
Other lips await you in your young life.

01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:21.381
Lips you loved touching you before, huh?

01:40:22.339 --> 01:40:24.547
Lips you wouldn't listen to

01:40:24.672 --> 01:40:28.506
when they warned you
all this would happen. No?

01:40:31.339 --> 01:40:34.547
Perhaps that is true.

01:40:34.672 --> 01:40:39.631
I only know there will never be
another Valentino.

01:40:41.256 --> 01:40:45.214
There will never be one
even remotely like him.

01:40:46.714 --> 01:40:48.756
<i>Dye vushka.</i> ..

01:40:50.756 --> 01:40:53.089
He was a God.

(lndistinct shouting)

01:41:23.381 --> 01:41:27.089
Those who buried Caesar
have now come to praise him.

01:41:35.172 --> 01:41:38.714
If only you'd told me how sick he was.

01:41:38.839 --> 01:41:41.131
Why didn't you tell me?

01:41:42.672 --> 01:41:44.547
What could you have done?

01:41:44.672 --> 01:41:48.547
He wouldn't listen to me.
He wouldn't listen to his doctor.

01:41:48.672 --> 01:41:51.464
Have you ever tried to stop a man
from committing suicide?

01:41:51.589 --> 01:41:55.547
He wasn't committing suicide, George,
he was fighting for his life.

01:41:55.672 --> 01:41:59.922
For Christ's sakes, June.
It was a crazy dream.

01:42:06.672 --> 01:42:09.006
Very moving performance.

01:42:09.131 --> 01:42:11.172
It was terrible.

01:42:11.297 --> 01:42:14.631
- I feel sorry for her.
- Well, palsy, don't worry about it.

01:42:14.756 --> 01:42:18.506
Like they say in the sticks, if it's good
enough for the hicks, it ain't for the slicks.

01:42:18.631 --> 01:42:20.631
<i>I'll</i> find a taxi.

01:42:20.756 --> 01:42:22.381
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?

01:42:22.506 --> 01:42:24.756
I would like to walk.

01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:26.339
I'd prefer that you got to bed early,

01:42:26.464 --> 01:42:29.006
so that you're well-rested
for that premiere tomorrow, Rudy.

01:42:29.131 --> 01:42:32.547
Every newsman this side of Kansas City
is going to be there.

01:42:32.672 --> 01:42:34.422
News...

01:42:34.547 --> 01:42:38.422
Playing Son Of The Sheik -
is that news?

01:42:38.547 --> 01:42:41.297
Well, it's good publicity for the picture.

01:42:41.422 --> 01:42:43.589
Oh, it'll do all right.

01:42:43.714 --> 01:42:47.256
Yeah, but a personal appearance once
in a while doesn't hurt anyone, you know?

01:42:47.381 --> 01:42:49.506
Have you got the reservations
for the sleeping car?

01:42:49.631 --> 01:42:50.631
Yes, don't worry.

01:42:50.756 --> 01:42:53.964
We leave for Hollywood on the Superchief
right after the reception tomorrow night.

01:42:54.089 --> 01:42:56.339
I'm just an anxious to get back as you are.

01:42:58.006 --> 01:43:00.047
But not for the same reason.

01:43:01.172 --> 01:43:05.089
No, and that's why it's more important that
you see your doctor instead of Natasha.

01:43:05.214 --> 01:43:07.756
She's not there anyway.

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:11.506
After the way she dressed that stupid actor
up to look like you and then crucified you,

01:43:11.631 --> 01:43:13.589
no way is she going to be there.

01:43:13.714 --> 01:43:15.797
This time you are wrong, George.

01:43:15.922 --> 01:43:18.089
I'm not going back to Natasha.

01:43:18.214 --> 01:43:20.631
I'm going to buy my orange grove at last.

01:43:20.756 --> 01:43:22.631
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

01:43:22.756 --> 01:43:25.131
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, Christ!

01:43:25.256 --> 01:43:27.547
Wanna have a good time?

01:43:27.672 --> 01:43:31.339
- Which one?
- Oh, I can handle two at once.

01:43:31.464 --> 01:43:34.339
I got the sockets if you got the plugs.

01:43:34.464 --> 01:43:35.922
I envy you, Madam.

01:43:36.047 --> 01:43:40.006
I myself don't seem capable
of sustaining even one effort for very long.

01:43:40.131 --> 01:43:43.422
What's the matter, baby?
Got the blues?

01:43:43.547 --> 01:43:47.839
Mama knows a pretty swank speak
just around the corner.

01:43:47.964 --> 01:43:49.589
George, I want a drink.

01:43:49.714 --> 01:43:53.381
Rudy, the only spigot you're supposed
to be tapping is attached to a cow.

01:43:53.506 --> 01:43:56.089
Who are you -
his wet nurse or something?

01:43:57.214 --> 01:44:01.047
Hi, Buzz. Got a couple of rich relatives
from outta town.

01:44:01.172 --> 01:44:03.422
Well, that'll be $25.

01:44:10.672 --> 01:44:14.797
Great, we're just in time for the show.
Hi, girls.

01:44:14.922 --> 01:44:18.672
All right.
Frank, grab that one for us.

01:44:20.214 --> 01:44:22.297
Come on, sit down.

01:44:27.297 --> 01:44:31.297
J' Oh, Rudy, what have you done
to the U.S. male?

01:44:31.422 --> 01:44:35.089
J' We liked him better
when his cheeks were pale

01:44:35.214 --> 01:44:38.964
J' You turned him into a Sheik, a freak

01:44:39.089 --> 01:44:42.089
J' Slave bracelets, let's face it,
make us shriek

01:44:42.214 --> 01:44:45.797
J' Oh, Rudy, oh, Rudy,
oh, what have you done?

01:44:45.922 --> 01:44:48.797
J' I can't have me any more fun

01:44:48.922 --> 01:44:52.839
J' I might as well become a nun,
oh, oh, oh

01:44:52.964 --> 01:44:55.297
J' Rudy, what have you done?

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:59.172
J' What have you done to the U.S. male?

01:44:59.297 --> 01:45:02.881
J' We liked him better
when his cheeks were pale

01:45:03.006 --> 01:45:07.047
J' We hate him now
he uses talcum powder

01:45:07.172 --> 01:45:10.464
J' Liked him better
when his clothes were louder

01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:14.756
J' Gee, I guess I ought to take
a powder from Rudy

01:45:14.881 --> 01:45:19.547
J' The pink powder puff J'

01:45:19.672 --> 01:45:20.672
Whoop!

01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:23.547
They do this sort of thing all the time.

01:45:23.672 --> 01:45:26.922
Get some hot poop out of the paper,
turn it into a tune.

01:45:27.047 --> 01:45:29.131
You should've seen what they did
with that monkey trial...

01:45:29.256 --> 01:45:32.131
What does she mean about the paper,
George?

01:45:32.256 --> 01:45:34.839
It was nothing, Rudy. An editorial.

01:45:34.964 --> 01:45:37.756
Some small-time hack
trying to make a name for himself,

01:45:37.881 --> 01:45:41.589
doing a hatchet job for the Herald -
nobody ever pays any attention to that.

01:45:41.714 --> 01:45:44.047
Don't worry about it, huh? Rudy!

01:45:44.672 --> 01:45:47.464
<i>'</i> Rudy!

01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:50.297
You stay put and pay the tab, buster.

01:45:59.631 --> 01:46:01.464
<i>Stronzo! Merda!</i>

01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:04.381
How dare this insect insult me like that?

01:46:04.506 --> 01:46:06.631
Guy's not worth a second thought.
Forget him.

01:46:06.756 --> 01:46:08.381
<i>Assassino!</i>

01:46:08.506 --> 01:46:11.922
I shall make him eat his words.
<i>l'll</i> challenge him.

01:46:12.047 --> 01:46:15.006
For Christ's sake,
we don't fight duels in America.

01:46:15.131 --> 01:46:18.589
I don't intend to fight a duel.
<i>I'll</i> meet him in the ring.

01:46:18.714 --> 01:46:20.881
That's ridiculous.
You're in no condition to fight.

01:46:21.006 --> 01:46:24.839
Ridiculous.
<i>I'll</i> tell you what is ridiculous, George -

01:46:24.964 --> 01:46:28.714
that I should be born into such a time
when a machine is invented

01:46:28.839 --> 01:46:33.381
that can turn a man who wants only to be
a farmer into some kind of a God.

01:46:34.672 --> 01:46:37.089
That people can stand in line for hours

01:46:37.214 --> 01:46:41.131
to sit in some dark room
to see me flickering past their eyes.

01:46:41.256 --> 01:46:45.047
They fall in love,
they destroy your marriage,

01:46:45.172 --> 01:46:50.672
they tear you to shreds or else ask
why I wasn't quietly drowned.

01:46:52.422 --> 01:46:56.631
Millions of people who never met me,
never heard me speak.

01:46:56.756 --> 01:46:58.547
That's what is ridiculous.

01:46:58.672 --> 01:47:00.506
Okey-dokey.

01:47:00.631 --> 01:47:02.922
<i>L'll</i> cancel the reservations.

01:47:16.547 --> 01:47:18.881
To the man who wrote an editorial

01:47:19.006 --> 01:47:22.339
headed "Pink Powder Puff"
in the Sunday Herald.

01:47:22.464 --> 01:47:24.631
Your editorial is
a scurrilous personal attack

01:47:24.756 --> 01:47:26.672
upon me, my race, my father's name.

01:47:28.672 --> 01:47:31.839
You cast ridicule upon my Italian ancestry.

01:47:33.131 --> 01:47:36.256
You cast doubt upon my manhood.

01:47:36.381 --> 01:47:38.631
I call you in return
a contemptible coward

01:47:38.756 --> 01:47:42.214
and challenge you to meet me
in a boxing arena

01:47:42.339 --> 01:47:45.256
to prove in typical American fashion,

01:47:45.381 --> 01:47:47.547
for I am an American,

01:47:47.672 --> 01:47:49.047
which of us is a better man.

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:54.797
Hoping to have an opportunity
to demonstrate to you

01:47:54.922 --> 01:47:56.714
that my wrist under a slave bracelet...

01:47:58.631 --> 01:48:02.506
...may snap a real fist
into your sagging jaw.

01:48:03.922 --> 01:48:08.672
I remain, with utter contempt,
Rudolph Valentino.

01:48:10.089 --> 01:48:13.256
Er... thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen, the exhibition is now over.

01:48:13.381 --> 01:48:15.464
Thank you.

01:48:16.964 --> 01:48:19.881
Hold it, fellas, hold it.

01:48:20.006 --> 01:48:24.047
Keep your notebooks out.
Rory O'Neil, New York <i>Evening</i> News.

01:48:25.631 --> 01:48:30.297
The man who wrote that article
is in a wheelchair, he's so old.

01:48:32.672 --> 01:48:36.172
So, I accept your challenge
on his behalf.

01:48:37.172 --> 01:48:42.839
And on behalf of all clean-living,
red-blooded Americans.

01:48:42.964 --> 01:48:45.089
(Applause, cheering)

01:48:47.964 --> 01:48:50.422
(Man) You tell 'em, Rory.
(Crowd) Yeah!

01:48:50.547 --> 01:48:53.506
Thanks, Rory.
Reserve a front row ticket for me.

01:48:54.672 --> 01:48:57.964
I wanna be there, Rory,
when you land the knock-out punch.

01:48:58.089 --> 01:48:59.589
Yeah, my boy!

01:48:59.714 --> 01:49:03.172
He'd be more at home with duelling
pistols and swords, wouldn't he, Rory?

01:49:04.464 --> 01:49:07.631
Whatever he wants is OK by me.

01:49:07.756 --> 01:49:11.131
I will meet him
with the weapons of his choice.

01:49:11.256 --> 01:49:14.672
How about powder puffs
at twenty paces, Sugar?

01:49:16.089 --> 01:49:18.547
You must forgive Mr Valentino.

01:49:18.672 --> 01:49:23.006
His sensitivity, gentlemen -
he has a very important premiere today

01:49:23.131 --> 01:49:25.172
- and besides which his health is not...
- George!

01:49:25.297 --> 01:49:27.256
Hold it!

01:49:27.381 --> 01:49:29.839
I apologise.
This is the wrong time and place.

01:49:29.964 --> 01:49:32.214
Get your hands off me.

01:49:34.756 --> 01:49:37.256
I don't need any help from your kind.

01:49:39.422 --> 01:49:41.214
<i>I'll</i> see you in the ring.

01:49:42.047 --> 01:49:44.922
And God help you!

01:49:45.047 --> 01:49:48.339
(Man) I can't wait to write this one up.

01:49:48.464 --> 01:49:49.922
Well, you've done it now, sluggo,

01:49:50.047 --> 01:49:54.256
you've just challenged the
ex-heavyweight champion of the Navy.

01:50:01.297 --> 01:50:04.047
(J' Dancehall music plays)

01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:08.631
Damnit, Rudy. We've been set up.

01:50:08.756 --> 01:50:11.922
We're the victims of a cheap publicity stunt
by the News.

01:50:12.047 --> 01:50:15.797
- Now, let's call the whole thing off.
- That's just what they want.

01:50:15.922 --> 01:50:19.922
"Valentino ducks fight."
Can't you see the headlines?

01:50:38.964 --> 01:50:41.797
What the hell is going on?

01:50:41.922 --> 01:50:44.464
What kind of madness is this?

01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:47.214
Ullman! Ullman!

01:50:47.339 --> 01:50:52.047
I want you to get Rudolph dressed
and get him out of this place,

01:50:52.172 --> 01:50:55.172
and not just now, but immediately!

01:50:55.297 --> 01:50:57.006
Go away, Joseph.

01:50:57.131 --> 01:50:59.589
This is none of your business.

01:50:59.714 --> 01:51:01.506
So, it's none of my business?

01:51:01.631 --> 01:51:06.089
Listen, the publicity is going to ruin you,
The Son Of <i>A</i> Sheik,

01:51:06.214 --> 01:51:08.881
but more important - me!

01:51:09.006 --> 01:51:13.047
I'm gonna warn you, Ullman -
get him down, and get him out of here.

01:51:13.172 --> 01:51:16.714
Don't you think I haven't been trying
to do that, Mr Schenck?

01:51:16.839 --> 01:51:21.839
- For Christ's sakes, it's too late now.
- Then it's too late for the both of you.

01:51:21.964 --> 01:51:27.214
I consider this a contravention
and an infringement of our agreement,

01:51:27.339 --> 01:51:31.006
so either you call off this whole business,

01:51:31.131 --> 01:51:35.964
or both you and your contract
are null and void

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:39.256
both separately and collectively.

01:51:39.381 --> 01:51:43.589
So, go tell your client
he's hereby suspended.

01:51:43.714 --> 01:51:46.089
You're making a big mistake, Mr Schenck.

01:51:46.214 --> 01:51:49.631
Let him go, George.
That suits me fine.

01:51:49.756 --> 01:51:53.297
I have no intention
of making more pictures anyway.

01:51:53.422 --> 01:51:57.089
- After this I'm going back to California.
- I know, the orange grove.

01:51:57.214 --> 01:51:58.464
(J' Fanfare)

01:52:14.131 --> 01:52:17.506
(J' "The Star-Spangled Banner")

01:52:43.964 --> 01:52:47.172
Ladies, gentlemen,

01:52:48.422 --> 01:52:50.297
and others,

01:52:52.631 --> 01:52:55.631
we are presenting tonight

01:52:55.756 --> 01:52:59.131
a dancing contest.

01:52:59.256 --> 01:53:03.714
I'm sorry, I mean a boxing contest,

01:53:03.839 --> 01:53:08.881
comprising of three three-minute rounds

01:53:09.006 --> 01:53:13.006
between Mr Rory O'Neil,

01:53:13.131 --> 01:53:16.464
heavyweight champion of the Navy

01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:20.006
at 216 pounds

01:53:20.131 --> 01:53:24.631
in the red corner,

01:53:24.756 --> 01:53:30.297
and Rudy Valentino of Hollywood

01:53:30.422 --> 01:53:34.006
at 155 pounds

01:53:34.131 --> 01:53:37.547
in the pink corner.

01:53:40.089 --> 01:53:43.006
Now, when the bell rings, I want you
to come out of your corners fighting.

01:53:43.131 --> 01:53:46.714
Fight clean, and may the best man win.

01:53:47.464 --> 01:53:49.506
- Oh...
- Hey!

01:53:51.006 --> 01:53:52.756
Right.

01:53:57.756 --> 01:54:01.172
- Look out, Rory, he's behind you.
- Ooh!

01:54:01.297 --> 01:54:03.172
Powder puff lover.

01:54:06.089 --> 01:54:07.214
(Referee) One...

01:54:07.339 --> 01:54:08.631
Hey, ref, that's a foul.

01:54:08.756 --> 01:54:13.089
...four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

01:54:17.881 --> 01:54:20.547
Rory, the great lover hit me.

01:54:22.089 --> 01:54:24.756
Oh, this is... Goddamnit!

01:54:27.422 --> 01:54:29.256
No, don't let him clinch you.

01:54:33.006 --> 01:54:34.172
(Groans)

01:54:34.297 --> 01:54:36.297
Rudolph!

01:54:41.631 --> 01:54:44.672
(Crowd chanting) Rory! Rory...!

01:54:57.256 --> 01:54:58.506
(Bell rings)

01:55:00.506 --> 01:55:02.756
Hey, get out! Get out of here!

01:55:04.172 --> 01:55:05.672
Filthy son of a bitch!

01:55:05.797 --> 01:55:08.797
(J' Dancehall music plays)

01:55:13.922 --> 01:55:16.672
(Crowd chanting) Rory! Rory...!

01:55:36.214 --> 01:55:37.631
Do you want to ruin his face?

01:55:37.756 --> 01:55:41.381
For Christ's sakes, George,
throw in the towel.

01:55:41.964 --> 01:55:44.797
- If you do, you are through.
- And if I don't, you're through.

01:55:44.922 --> 01:55:48.047
Now use your right. Set him up
with your left and then give him the right.

01:55:48.172 --> 01:55:50.131
I didn't know you were a boxing fan, June.

01:55:50.256 --> 01:55:55.422
I just heard about it on the radio...
on the radio, for Christ's sakes!

01:55:55.547 --> 01:55:58.381
Rudy, don't you see what a farce this is?

01:55:58.506 --> 01:56:00.256
You've got the wrong script, June Mathis.

01:56:00.381 --> 01:56:02.506
This is a matter of honour.

01:56:02.631 --> 01:56:05.172
I think you're doing swell, champ.
Give him hell.

01:56:05.297 --> 01:56:10.631
Thank you, madam. It is nice to have
someone in my corner, rooting for me.

01:56:11.422 --> 01:56:16.339
- Oh, God! Rudy, please.
- Attaboy, Rory.

01:56:16.464 --> 01:56:18.506
Attaboy, champ.

01:56:25.756 --> 01:56:26.797
(Groans)

01:56:31.964 --> 01:56:34.047
Oh, my God!

01:56:37.381 --> 01:56:39.506
One, two, three...

01:56:39.631 --> 01:56:42.172
(Crowd chanting) Rory! Rory...!

01:56:45.422 --> 01:56:48.214
One, two, three, four, five...

01:57:01.714 --> 01:57:04.172
(Crowd chanting) Rory! Rory...!

01:57:04.297 --> 01:57:06.714
Hey, Rory, bring him over here.

01:57:07.381 --> 01:57:11.172
May I have the pleasure of this dance?

01:57:11.297 --> 01:57:13.006
Music, Maestro!

01:57:13.131 --> 01:57:15.381
(J' Orchestra plays tango)

01:57:39.714 --> 01:57:41.089
Olé.

01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:52.797
(Fan) Don't let him do that to you.
Come on out.

01:58:06.089 --> 01:58:08.797
Get him out of here.

01:58:10.047 --> 01:58:11.756
Get him away!

01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:31.756
For Christ's sake, look at his face.

01:58:31.881 --> 01:58:36.214
Oh, Rudy, please.
Oh, Rudy, please stop it.

01:58:36.339 --> 01:58:38.422
Don't worry about a thing, champ.

01:58:38.547 --> 01:58:41.464
That big rummy's so out of breath,
he's growing gills.

01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:43.547
Why don't you beat it, lady?

01:58:43.672 --> 01:58:46.672
You want us to borrow
your broomstick, toots?

01:58:47.797 --> 01:58:48.881
Let me...

01:59:00.006 --> 01:59:01.797
Let me call it off.

01:59:06.464 --> 01:59:08.047
You can do it, champ.

01:59:08.172 --> 01:59:11.506
Wanna give up, pretty boy,
before I muss your hair?

01:59:13.631 --> 01:59:15.089
Oh, that's it!

01:59:17.047 --> 01:59:20.381
One, two, three...

01:59:21.797 --> 01:59:22.922
four...

01:59:24.797 --> 01:59:28.922
five, six, seven, eight...

01:59:30.631 --> 01:59:32.131
nine.

01:59:33.631 --> 01:59:36.381
Oh, come on, champ.

01:59:37.047 --> 01:59:40.214
That's it! That's it! Oh...

01:59:47.547 --> 01:59:50.797
Madam, permit me
to complete your dance card.

01:59:55.047 --> 01:59:57.506
Yeah! Ooh!

02:00:11.172 --> 02:00:14.214
(Laughs) We did it!

02:00:14.339 --> 02:00:17.006
One, two, three,

02:00:17.672 --> 02:00:21.214
four, five, six, seven,

02:00:21.922 --> 02:00:24.422
eight, nine, ten.

02:00:24.547 --> 02:00:26.006
(Bell rings)

02:00:30.297 --> 02:00:33.214
(I Music plays)

02:00:48.089 --> 02:00:50.672
We made it. Come along, June.

02:00:50.797 --> 02:00:53.881
(Crowd) Rudy! Rudy! Rudy...!

02:00:58.714 --> 02:01:00.631
That's my boy!

02:01:01.422 --> 02:01:03.172
That's my boy!

02:01:04.547 --> 02:01:06.381
My boy!

02:01:06.506 --> 02:01:10.422
I love you.
I love you like you were my own son.

02:01:10.547 --> 02:01:14.464
You can have whatever you like.
You can write your own ticket.

02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:18.172
<i>- I'll</i> see you on the lot.
- Hey, no hard feelings, huh?

02:01:18.297 --> 02:01:20.797
- Have a drink.
- Oh, no.

02:01:20.922 --> 02:01:23.172
No, he's celebrating with milk tonight.

02:01:23.297 --> 02:01:28.547
Milk? Hey, what's that for?
His complexion?

02:01:28.672 --> 02:01:32.839
- It's for my teeth.
- Oh, yeah, of course, I forgot.

02:01:32.964 --> 02:01:35.381
You use powder for your complexion.

02:01:35.506 --> 02:01:40.089
- He's more of a man than you'll ever be.
- Is that so?

02:01:40.214 --> 02:01:42.464
Well, here's another challenge.

02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:46.006
He managed three laps
round the dancefloor -

02:01:46.131 --> 02:01:48.339
let's see how many rounds he can go

02:01:48.464 --> 02:01:51.381
before he takes a dive
in Kelly's Speakeasy.

02:01:51.506 --> 02:01:53.256
Come on, O'Neil.

02:01:53.381 --> 02:01:57.006
He's beaten you once tonight,
and with this right...

02:01:57.131 --> 02:01:59.672
It's all right, George. <i>l'll</i> accept.

02:01:59.797 --> 02:02:02.672
Right! See you there in thirty minutes.

02:02:04.297 --> 02:02:07.881
You mean that big gorilla beating you
half to death wasn't enough?

02:02:08.006 --> 02:02:11.672
You want to finish it yourself?
Well, don't look for me at ringside.

02:02:11.797 --> 02:02:14.422
Why? What do you mean?
What does George mean?

02:02:14.547 --> 02:02:17.089
Do you know the way
to Kelly's Speakeasy?

02:02:18.339 --> 02:02:20.464
What does George mean?

02:03:00.672 --> 02:03:02.922
He's finished!

02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:12.839
(Belches)

02:03:12.964 --> 02:03:14.964
Excuse me.

02:03:27.047 --> 02:03:30.547
Hey, champ,
how about a word for the press?

02:03:37.672 --> 02:03:41.339
Tell those cowardly hatchet men

02:03:42.631 --> 02:03:46.256
that by the outcome
of these contests tonight,

02:03:48.297 --> 02:03:54.964
this American has vindicated his honour

02:03:55.089 --> 02:03:57.172
and his manhood.

02:04:01.714 --> 02:04:04.047
J' For he's a jolly good fellow

02:04:04.172 --> 02:04:06.256
J' For he's a jolly good fellow

02:04:06.381 --> 02:04:09.589
J' For he's a jolly good fellow

02:04:09.714 --> 02:04:12.006
J' Which nobody can deny

02:04:12.131 --> 02:04:14.131
J' Which nobody can deny

02:04:14.256 --> 02:04:16.256
J' Which nobody can deny

02:04:16.381 --> 02:04:18.381
J' For he's a jolly good fellow

02:04:18.506 --> 02:04:20.756
- J' For he's a jolly good fellow
- I want these maniacs to get out.

02:04:20.881 --> 02:04:24.214
J' For he's a jolly good fellow... J'

02:04:24.339 --> 02:04:26.672
<i>I'll</i> see you later.

02:05:20.714 --> 02:05:24.422

(J' RICHARD DAY LEWIS:
"There's A New Star In Heaven Tonight")

02:06:14.672 --> 02:06:21.672
J' There's a new star in heaven tonight

02:06:21.797 --> 02:06:28.881
J' That will never fade from our sight

02:06:29.006 --> 02:06:32.297
J' There's a new star at home

02:06:32.422 --> 02:06:36.047
J' In that far starry dome

02:06:36.172 --> 02:06:43.464
J' Shining down on his loved ones tonight

02:06:44.131 --> 02:06:50.672
J' There's a voice singing,
"Lead, kindly light"

02:06:50.797 --> 02:06:58.297
J' With a smile
that has made the world bright

02:06:58.422 --> 02:07:05.589
J' Valentino, goodbye

02:07:05.714 --> 02:07:13.214
