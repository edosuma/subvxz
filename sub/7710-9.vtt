WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.106
It is Friday morning.

00:02.139 --> 00:03.807
And it is another
beautiful day

00:03.841 --> 00:08.518
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.223
Oh, my God.

00:11.257 --> 00:12.658
Oh!

00:15.664 --> 00:19.172
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

00:19.207 --> 00:22.213
Oh, we have
a serious problem here.

00:22.245 --> 00:23.047
All right, everybody.

00:23.081 --> 00:24.550
Lock the doors.
Turn off the lights.

00:24.583 --> 00:25.652
Pretend you're not here.

00:25.684 --> 00:28.490
Are we in danger?

00:28.524 --> 00:31.564
There's no time to think
about it. This is real.

00:31.597 --> 00:34.069
Just shh, everybody.

00:39.147 --> 00:40.814
Michael,
should I call the--

00:40.849 --> 00:43.121
What?

00:43.155 --> 00:45.391
The I.T. tech guy and me

00:45.424 --> 00:48.698
did not get off
to a great start.

00:51.436 --> 00:54.442
*

01:22.298 --> 01:24.237
Yeah, I tried
to install it myself,

01:24.270 --> 01:25.839
but you guys
have these things

01:25.871 --> 01:28.345
so password-protected.

01:28.377 --> 01:30.349
That just means you
have to enter your password.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.551
Uh...

01:31.583 --> 01:33.487
What's your password,
Michael?

01:33.520 --> 01:35.459
Um, it's--

01:35.491 --> 01:38.597
Oh. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Yes.

01:45.479 --> 01:47.849
Michael--
Aah! Gah!

01:47.883 --> 01:49.619
Please don't do that.

01:49.652 --> 01:50.989
Okay, I'm sorry.
What is going on in there?

01:51.021 --> 01:53.627
Why is he here?
What are you doing?

01:53.660 --> 01:54.863
I can't tell you.

01:54.897 --> 01:55.932
You have to tell me.

01:55.964 --> 01:57.303
I don't have
to tell you anything.

01:57.336 --> 01:59.373
Look, Michael.

01:59.407 --> 02:01.443
I know you don't want to
have to think about this,

02:01.477 --> 02:02.746
but if something were
to happen to you,

02:02.778 --> 02:04.817
God forbid, then I would
need to know

02:04.849 --> 02:06.051
in order to take over.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.688
Dwight, nothing is
gonna happen to me. Okay?

02:07.722 --> 02:08.690
I'm in the best shape
of my life.

02:08.725 --> 02:09.959
Look at at this. Grr!

02:09.993 --> 02:10.762
Yeah, but that
doesn't matter.

02:10.794 --> 02:12.398
You could get
a brain aneurysm.

02:12.432 --> 02:13.568
I'm not gonna--
Or hit by a car.

02:13.601 --> 02:14.936
Stop.
Or a bus or a train.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.473
You could get poisoned.
Fall down a well.

02:16.507 --> 02:17.908
Step on a mine. Choke.

02:17.943 --> 02:20.414
Okay, if I step on a mine
in Scranton, Pennsylvania,

02:20.449 --> 02:22.017
and die, you can have
my job. Okay?

02:22.050 --> 02:23.920
Why don't you just go away?

02:23.955 --> 02:25.325
There are certain things

02:25.359 --> 02:27.796
a boss does not share
with his employees.

02:27.829 --> 02:30.835
His salary.
That would depress them.

02:30.869 --> 02:34.542
His bed.

02:34.577 --> 02:37.949
And I am not going
to tell them

02:37.983 --> 02:40.754
that I'll be reading
their e-mails.

02:40.788 --> 02:42.359
So how do you search?

02:42.393 --> 02:44.497
By keyword phrase.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.666
Try profits.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.770
No, try Michael Scott.

02:48.804 --> 02:52.678
Michael, boss,
and funny.

02:55.584 --> 02:58.858
Oh, my God! Wow!

02:58.891 --> 03:00.159
E-mail from Stanley.

03:00.193 --> 03:02.866
Stanley.
Terribly nice guy.

03:02.898 --> 03:04.437
"Sorry I didn't
write back sooner.

03:04.469 --> 03:05.505
"I can't go
to the game tonight

03:05.538 --> 03:06.907
"because my boss
Michael is an ass

03:06.941 --> 03:08.076
and making
me stay late."

03:08.108 --> 03:10.682
Well, Stanley's an ass.

03:10.715 --> 03:12.453
Not one of
our harder workers.

03:18.765 --> 03:19.799
Hey, what's the deal,
Michael?

03:19.832 --> 03:21.101
Why are you spying
on our computers?

03:21.135 --> 03:22.973
Oh, no!

03:23.006 --> 03:24.910
Everybody,
Oscar's gone crazy.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.846
What other ghost stories
do you have for us?

03:26.880 --> 03:30.052
That I'm a robot?

03:30.087 --> 03:33.495
I will destory everything in my
path.

03:33.528 --> 03:34.530
Actually, we just--

03:34.563 --> 03:37.166
Boop! Beep! Bop!

03:37.201 --> 03:38.904
Okay.
Bonk!

03:38.938 --> 03:42.011
Boop boop. Oil can.

03:42.044 --> 03:44.749
Oil can.

03:44.782 --> 03:46.152
Tin Man.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.725
Actually we just got
a memo from I.T.

03:48.757 --> 03:50.529
saying you're doing
e-mail surveillance.

03:50.562 --> 03:53.133
Oh, what? No, that defeats
the whole purpose.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.505
So it's true? You have
access to our e

03:55.539 --> 03:56.507
You know what
the problem is?

03:56.541 --> 03:57.643
I think I do.

03:57.676 --> 03:59.513
The problem is
that when people

03:59.547 --> 04:01.516
hear the term
"Big Brother"

04:01.550 --> 04:04.188
they immediately think
it's scary or bad.

04:04.221 --> 04:07.563
But I don't. I think,
"Wow. I love my Big Brother."

04:07.595 --> 04:10.534
I gotta erase
a lot of stuff.

04:10.569 --> 04:13.707
A lot of stuff.

04:13.741 --> 04:15.944
Oh, hey.
Just so you know.

04:15.979 --> 04:17.816
If you have
any sensitive e-mails,

04:17.848 --> 04:20.053
they need to be
deleted immediately.

04:20.087 --> 04:21.055
I know.

04:21.089 --> 04:22.658
Good.

04:24.862 --> 04:26.634
Hey.

04:29.806 --> 04:31.042
Something just happened.

04:31.075 --> 04:33.648
Dwight just told Angela
that she has to delete

04:33.681 --> 04:35.784
all of her sensitive
e-mails immediately.

04:35.819 --> 04:38.056
What?
I know.

04:38.089 --> 04:39.593
Hmm.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.794
Do you think
that they're like--

04:40.829 --> 04:42.666
No.
Right, no.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.237
Ugh! Ew.

04:45.270 --> 04:48.209
Ew, ew, ew.

04:48.243 --> 04:49.713
Maybe.

04:49.747 --> 04:53.286
It's like squishing a spider
under a book.

04:53.319 --> 04:56.360
It's gonna be really gross,
but I have to look

04:56.392 --> 04:59.098
and make sure
that it's really dead.

04:59.131 --> 05:03.038
So if you guys
see anything...

05:03.073 --> 05:05.343
Hey, Dwight? Um...

05:05.378 --> 05:07.147
My friend is kind of into

05:07.181 --> 05:08.784
these two girls
that he works with.

05:08.817 --> 05:11.790
Nice.
One is tall and brunette.

05:11.823 --> 05:15.030
And the other one
is short and blonde

05:15.062 --> 05:18.136
and perky
and kind of judgmental.

05:18.169 --> 05:19.972
Who do you think
he should choose?

05:21.242 --> 05:23.748
Does he have access
to their medical records?

05:23.780 --> 05:27.154
Um...

05:27.187 --> 05:30.126
I think one of the greatest
things about modern America

05:30.160 --> 05:32.733
is the computerization
of medical records.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.336
As a volunteer sheriff,
I can look up

05:34.369 --> 05:38.377
anyone's psychiatric records
or surgical histories.

05:38.409 --> 05:40.112
Yeast infections.

05:40.146 --> 05:42.217
There are huge number

05:42.251 --> 05:45.725
of yeast infections
in this county.

05:45.759 --> 05:49.900
Probably because
we're down river

05:49.932 --> 05:52.103
from that old bread factory.

05:52.136 --> 05:55.076
Meredith has an E-vite

05:55.109 --> 05:56.881
from Jim.

05:56.914 --> 05:59.887
"Barbecue at Jim's tonight."

05:59.920 --> 06:03.961
Tonight? Wonder where
my e

06:03.994 --> 06:05.498
Click on guest list.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.769
Angela. Stanley. Oscar.

06:07.803 --> 06:12.478
Meredith. Phyllis.
Kevin. Creed.

06:12.511 --> 06:16.184
Must be...

06:16.219 --> 06:18.088
No.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.236
Hey, Angela.
How's it going?

06:25.270 --> 06:26.841
It's okay.

06:26.874 --> 06:28.009
Listen, are you
bringing anyone

06:28.042 --> 06:29.278
to Jim's party tonight?

06:29.311 --> 06:30.981
No. Are we supposed to?

06:31.015 --> 06:33.988
No. I mean I don't know.
I don't think so.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.426
Hmm. Excuse me.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.063
Oh.

06:49.351 --> 06:51.389
There's always a distance

06:51.423 --> 06:53.427
between a boss
and the employees.

06:53.460 --> 06:56.533
It is just nature's rule.

06:56.565 --> 06:58.470
It's intimidation, mostly.

06:58.504 --> 07:00.841
It's the awareness
that they are not me.

07:00.841 --> 07:05.250
I do think that
I am very approachable

07:05.282 --> 07:08.288
as one of the guys.

07:08.322 --> 07:12.264
But maybe I need to be
even approachabler.

07:12.296 --> 07:13.667
Ahem.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.438
That's pretty, um--
Yeah.

07:17.475 --> 07:19.111
Are you gonna
eat with us?

07:19.144 --> 07:20.513
Of course.

07:20.548 --> 07:21.649
Hanging with my crew.

07:21.683 --> 07:24.188
Crew that I am one of.

07:24.220 --> 07:28.362
Hanging with
my Cup of Noodles.

07:28.396 --> 07:30.501
This is a meal in a cup
right here.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.006
Hot, tasty.
Reminds me of college.

07:33.039 --> 07:36.445
Lived on this stuff.
Brain food. Mmm.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.716
You know what I really,
really miss about college?

07:38.749 --> 07:41.455
The parties.
Everybody'd go.

07:41.490 --> 07:45.030
The athletes. The nerds.
The professors.

07:45.063 --> 07:47.134
The professors would
go to the parties?

07:47.166 --> 07:50.406
Yeah. They were the most fun.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.376
We always invited them.

07:54.748 --> 07:57.087
It's true.
I'm having a party.

07:57.121 --> 08:00.060
I've got three cases
of imported beer.

08:00.093 --> 08:00.961
Karaoke machine.

08:00.961 --> 08:04.000
And I didn't invite Michael.

08:04.035 --> 08:06.506
So three ingredients
for a great party.

08:06.540 --> 08:08.075
And it's nothing personal.

08:08.109 --> 08:09.410
I just think
if he were there,

08:09.445 --> 08:10.580
people wouldn't be able
to relax.

08:10.613 --> 08:12.284
You know, have fun.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.556
And my roommate wants
to meet everybody.

08:14.588 --> 08:18.696
Because I'm pretty sure
he thinks I'm making Dwight up.

08:18.730 --> 08:21.001
He is very real.

08:26.179 --> 08:27.446
What?

08:30.720 --> 08:33.527
Oh! Yes!

08:33.560 --> 08:35.329
Thank you.

08:41.309 --> 08:43.146
Question.

08:43.179 --> 08:45.416
On the Internet, there are
several different options

08:45.449 --> 08:46.620
to get to your house
for the party tonight.

08:46.653 --> 08:49.826
Oh, um, no.
No, no, no. Keep that down.

08:49.858 --> 08:51.262
Why?

08:51.294 --> 08:54.067
Because not everybody
knows about the party.

08:55.237 --> 08:58.276
Like who?
Who doesn't know?

08:58.308 --> 09:00.446
Um, Michael.

09:00.479 --> 09:02.217
Why just Michael?

09:04.789 --> 09:06.425
'Cause it's a surprise.

09:06.459 --> 09:07.761
Is it?
Mm-hmm.

09:07.795 --> 09:08.797
Oh, that's perfect.

09:08.829 --> 09:10.433
So don't tell.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.305
I won't.
Okay.

09:13.339 --> 09:15.177
So, Dwight thinks
that tonight

09:15.209 --> 09:16.712
is a surprise party
for Michael.

09:16.745 --> 09:18.816
Really? That's great.
I know.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.820
Maybe we can get him
to hide and wait somewhere.

09:22.456 --> 09:23.927
Oh, man.

09:23.959 --> 09:25.396
Oh, you know what?
Speaking of which,

09:25.430 --> 09:26.866
I was just trying
to get a handle on,

09:26.899 --> 09:29.270
you know, numbers
for food and stuff.

09:29.305 --> 09:30.840
So do you think
Roy's gonna come or--

09:30.874 --> 09:32.511
Oh, no.
He can't make it.

09:32.543 --> 09:34.615
Oh, okay. Cool.

09:37.321 --> 09:39.390
Here.
Hey.

09:39.425 --> 09:41.329
Almost quitting time.

09:41.362 --> 09:43.966
Yep. It's 4:00.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.738
One more hour

09:45.771 --> 09:48.508
to take care of anything
you forgot to do.

09:50.748 --> 09:54.255
Hey, I don't know if you
have any plans tonight,

09:54.288 --> 09:56.259
but if you don't,
we could hang out.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.571
Oh, um...I can't.

10:02.604 --> 10:03.840
You have plans?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do.

10:03.873 --> 10:05.844
Yeah, I do too,
I do too.
Oh, you do?

10:05.877 --> 10:07.581
Big plans. I do, yeah.

10:07.615 --> 10:08.750
Because you just said
you wanted to hang out--

10:08.784 --> 10:10.453
Tonight,
I can't do it tonight.

10:10.486 --> 10:12.891
No. Improv class.
I have improv class.

10:12.924 --> 10:14.696
Hanging out with
my improv buds.
Really?

10:14.729 --> 10:16.299
Yeah.
Oh, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

10:16.331 --> 10:17.867
Oh, it's the best.
It is the best.

10:17.902 --> 10:19.605
I would not miss it
for the world.

10:19.638 --> 10:22.644
But if something else came up,
I would definitely not go.

10:25.049 --> 10:26.619
Improv sounds great.

10:26.652 --> 10:28.924
It is.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.600
Okay.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.806
All right.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.076
What?

10:39.109 --> 10:40.881
I think Stanley
just coughed.

10:48.363 --> 10:49.899
Hey, Pam.

10:49.932 --> 10:51.735
Do you need me to walk you
to your vehicular transport?

10:51.769 --> 10:52.737
No, thanks.

10:52.771 --> 10:53.874
All right.

10:53.907 --> 10:55.076
Oscar, you have
big plans tonight--

10:55.108 --> 10:56.679
I'm on a call.
Okay.

10:56.712 --> 10:59.451
Kevin. Big man, big man.
What are you doing tonight?

10:59.485 --> 11:00.453
Where you off to?

11:00.487 --> 11:01.321
My brother is in town

11:01.321 --> 11:04.796
and we are going to see
the Alaska Film Festival at--

11:04.829 --> 11:06.866
Okay, all right.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.568
Hey, Angela.
Rushy, rushy.

11:08.603 --> 11:09.839
Where you rushing off to?

11:09.871 --> 11:11.374
I'm just leaving
for the day.

11:11.409 --> 11:12.877
Yeah, well, duh.
Where are you headed?

11:12.912 --> 11:15.382
Charity. Bake Drive.

11:15.417 --> 11:17.454
Liar! You are a liar.

11:17.486 --> 11:18.924
No, I'm not!

11:18.957 --> 11:21.161
Ohh. Dwight.

11:21.193 --> 11:23.165
Oh, Dwight,
my loyal compadre.

11:23.197 --> 11:25.470
You and I are
hanging tonight.

11:25.502 --> 11:27.875
The two of us.
We are celebrating

11:27.908 --> 11:30.145
our freedom
and our manhood.

11:30.179 --> 11:31.750
You know what?

11:31.782 --> 11:33.118
Why don't we watch that show
you've been wanting to watch?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.590
That stupid
Battleship Galaxy--

11:35.622 --> 11:36.792
Battlestar Galactica?

11:36.825 --> 11:39.498
That's--Whatever stupid show
you want to watch.

11:39.531 --> 11:41.669
I can't tonight.
Unfortunately I've got plans.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.042
I have to go to practice.
Soccer practice.

11:45.076 --> 11:47.481
I didn't know you played
soccer, Dwight.

11:47.514 --> 11:48.516
Clarinet.

11:48.549 --> 11:50.988
You too, Dwight?

11:51.021 --> 11:52.457
Have fun tonight.

11:52.491 --> 11:53.793
Whatever it is
that you're doing.

11:53.826 --> 11:56.664
And I'll see you Monday.

11:58.903 --> 12:00.672
He has no idea.

12:06.519 --> 12:07.754
Quick announcement,
everybody.

12:07.788 --> 12:08.957
If I could have
everybody's attention.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.659
We do have wine
in the kitchen.

12:10.693 --> 12:13.265
And there is beer
available on the porch.

12:13.298 --> 12:14.734
And despite
what you might think,

12:14.769 --> 12:16.038
it's not all for Meredith
and Kelly.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.606
So please enjoy.

12:17.641 --> 12:20.012
Jim, you really think
this is a good idea?

12:20.046 --> 12:22.050
Huh

12:22.083 --> 12:23.653
Hey, you must be Dwight.

12:23.685 --> 12:24.721
You don't work with us.

12:24.755 --> 12:25.991
That's because
Mark's my roommate.

12:26.024 --> 12:26.993
Oh.

12:27.026 --> 12:28.729
Hey, I love
the Birkenstocks.

12:28.763 --> 12:32.003
Thanks. Yeah, I always keep
an extra set in the car

12:32.036 --> 12:34.140
for special occasions.

12:34.174 --> 12:36.111
Jim, come here.
Mm

12:36.144 --> 12:39.017
When is the guest
of honor coming?

12:39.050 --> 12:40.752
Oh. Uh, later-ish.

12:40.788 --> 12:42.090
He's gonna love it!

12:42.123 --> 12:45.162
Great. I just wanted
to let you guys know

12:45.196 --> 12:47.133
that we will be taking
the tour like I promised--

12:47.166 --> 12:48.168
Hey.
Hey!

12:48.202 --> 12:49.705
Just in time.

12:49.738 --> 12:50.707
Do you want to go
on a group tour?

12:50.740 --> 12:51.775
We were just
about to leave.

12:51.810 --> 12:52.644
Definitely.

12:52.677 --> 12:54.047
Well, the group tour
is now leaving then.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.084
Ladies and gentlemen,
just a few things

12:56.118 --> 12:57.320
that we're going to be
pointing out to you today.

12:57.352 --> 12:59.758
You will be able
to see both bedrooms.

12:59.791 --> 13:01.194
And if we're lucky,

13:01.228 --> 13:03.331
maybe get a chance
to peek into the bathroom.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.868
Who knows? I have to
remind you also

13:04.902 --> 13:06.738
that flash photography
is prohibited.

13:06.772 --> 13:07.942
And as much as you can,

13:07.975 --> 13:09.777
please refrain
from touching things.

13:09.812 --> 13:11.314
I know you might want to.

13:11.347 --> 13:12.851
Hey, is Katie coming?

13:12.885 --> 13:14.620
Um, actually I haven't
talked to her in a while.

13:14.655 --> 13:16.859
Huh? Oh. Is it cool
if I call her?

13:16.893 --> 13:18.964
We'll talk
about that later.

13:18.996 --> 13:20.199
Okay, let's get
right into it.

13:20.231 --> 13:21.769
I need two people
for the first scene.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.140
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Mr. Kotter!

13:24.174 --> 13:25.877
Mr. Kot-ter!

13:25.911 --> 13:29.417
Okay. Michael.
And...

13:29.449 --> 13:31.053
Anybody?

13:31.087 --> 13:32.322
How about Marybeth?

13:32.356 --> 13:35.262
Okay.
Come on.

13:35.296 --> 13:36.833
Okay, so you start
us off, Marybeth.

13:36.865 --> 13:39.369
All right, great. Okay.

13:39.404 --> 13:43.377
* La la la la la

13:43.412 --> 13:44.815
Boom!
Detective Michael Scott!

13:44.849 --> 13:45.883
I'm with the FBI!

13:45.918 --> 13:48.454
Think about this. What is
the most exciting thing

13:48.487 --> 13:50.793
that can happen on TV
or in movies

13:50.827 --> 13:54.399
or in real life?
Somebody has a gun.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.470
That's why I always start
with a gun

13:56.503 --> 13:59.476
because you can't top it.
You just can't.

13:59.509 --> 14:01.681
I'm supposed to meet
my doctor here.

14:01.681 --> 14:04.020
Have you seen him?
He's a very angry midget.

14:04.054 --> 14:05.322
Boom! Freeze!

14:05.355 --> 14:06.759
Michael Scarn, FBI!

14:06.791 --> 14:08.195
You know what you did.

14:08.228 --> 14:10.331
Boom! Boom! Boom!

14:10.365 --> 14:12.036
Yeah, you thought
you could get away

14:12.070 --> 14:14.440
with your little ruse
didn't you

14:14.473 --> 14:16.011
Well, you didn't.

14:16.044 --> 14:18.114
Because I know where
you hid the diamonds.

14:18.147 --> 14:20.452
I've been on to you and your
little friends for weeks.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.523
Boom! Boom! Boom!

14:22.555 --> 14:24.027
I'm not even in the scene!

14:24.059 --> 14:25.096
Boom! Boom! Boom!

14:25.128 --> 14:26.932
Stop. Stop! Stop.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.037
Okay. You shot me.
Great. Stop.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.007
Okay, you can't just shoot
everyone in the scene.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.442
Well, if you hadn't
stopped the scene,

14:32.476 --> 14:33.846
you would've seen
where it was going.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.048
Okay. What about
the scene they set up?

14:35.081 --> 14:36.785
Boring.

14:36.819 --> 14:39.524
No, it wasn't.
No more guns. No, no.

14:39.556 --> 14:43.298
Michael, I want you to give me
all the guns you have.

14:43.332 --> 14:46.503
Just get rid of all your guns
and give them to me.

14:46.538 --> 14:48.910
Great.
Bleh!

14:48.944 --> 14:51.281
Bleh. Okay.

14:56.157 --> 14:58.194
Jim's bedroom.

15:02.870 --> 15:05.142
See, I knew we lost
somebody on the tour.

15:05.176 --> 15:07.513
Cool. This is your desk.

15:07.545 --> 15:08.515
This is my desk.

15:08.547 --> 15:10.052
Your home office.

15:10.085 --> 15:12.856
Home office.
This is it.
Yeah.

15:12.891 --> 15:14.359
You have to sit down so I can
get the full effect.

15:14.394 --> 15:18.568
Okay. Sure. Will do.

15:18.601 --> 15:22.510
Okay, wait.
So that would make me...

15:22.542 --> 15:24.347
Like right here.

15:24.380 --> 15:27.086
Yeah. Yep, that feels
about right.

15:27.119 --> 15:28.655
And then Dwight
would be like--

15:28.687 --> 15:30.993
You know what? Let's just
leave that image out of it.

15:31.028 --> 15:32.430
Because this is
a happy place.

15:32.463 --> 15:36.237
Happy thoughts, Pam.
Happy thoughts.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.642
Um...oh! Yearbook.

15:38.674 --> 15:40.446
Yeah, you don't
have to, um--

15:40.479 --> 15:43.885
All right. Yes, that's
not gonna be awkward at all.

15:45.556 --> 15:48.662
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah.

15:48.694 --> 15:52.003
You were so dorky!
Thank you.

16:00.218 --> 16:01.588
Freeze.
I'm in.

16:01.621 --> 16:03.058
Do you want to go over
the rules one more time?

16:03.092 --> 16:04.427
No, no, no, no.

16:06.698 --> 16:08.568
I'm looking
in my wallet for money

16:08.601 --> 16:11.473
so you can tell me
my fortune.

16:13.544 --> 16:15.548
I promise it's worth it.

16:15.581 --> 16:17.686
Oh, I can see you
walking out of here,

16:17.719 --> 16:19.624
and you're thrilled
with your reading.

16:22.030 --> 16:23.532
What are you--

16:30.611 --> 16:32.050
Michael, what did
you tell him?

16:32.083 --> 16:33.251
Nothing.

16:33.285 --> 16:35.689
Then why are
his hands up

16:35.721 --> 16:38.262
He told me he couldn't
show it to me,

16:38.294 --> 16:41.268
but he has a gun.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.105
Okay.
Let's call it a day.

16:43.138 --> 16:45.642
Good. That was good.

16:45.676 --> 16:47.479
Good work, everybody.

16:47.513 --> 16:51.788
Angela, burger, dog?
Having fun?

16:51.820 --> 16:54.459
I got sap on me.

16:54.493 --> 16:56.564
Chicken,
hot dog, burger.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.501
I'm a vegetarian.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.672
There's soda inside.

17:00.706 --> 17:01.808
Oh.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.178
I didn't think
the premium

17:03.212 --> 17:04.247
laser color
copy batch

17:04.280 --> 17:05.549
would sell as well
as it did.

17:05.581 --> 17:07.820
It surprised us all.
I'll tell you why. Because--

17:07.852 --> 17:09.190
I'm sorry, guys.

17:09.223 --> 17:10.792
Can we please not talk
about paper?

17:10.825 --> 17:13.798
There's gotta be something else
that we can talk about.

17:13.831 --> 17:16.737
Ahem.

17:18.841 --> 17:21.814
Um, I think
it's all right.

17:21.847 --> 17:24.820
I mean, jeez.
It's late already.

17:24.853 --> 17:26.857
Hmm.

17:29.164 --> 17:30.466
Hey, Phyllis.

17:30.498 --> 17:32.203
Come here
for a second.
Sure.

17:32.235 --> 17:33.405
Have you heard anything

17:33.437 --> 17:36.843
about any secret
office romances or--

17:36.878 --> 17:39.684
You tell me.

17:39.717 --> 17:42.256
Well, you do mean
you and Jim, right?

17:43.892 --> 17:46.497
Oh, God. I am so sorry.
I mean, I thought--

17:46.530 --> 17:48.467
You guys hang out
all the time.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.737
And you're talking
all the time.

17:49.770 --> 17:52.243
I'm sorry.
It's like--

17:52.276 --> 17:55.948
It's okay. It's okay.

17:55.981 --> 18:00.591
Ah! Not so fast,
fire guy.

18:02.162 --> 18:03.832
How do we get to Bernie's
Tavern from here?

18:03.865 --> 18:05.435
Oh, don't worry.
We're all gonna carpool.

18:05.468 --> 18:06.871
So, Bernie's, huh?
We're all going to Bernie's?

18:06.903 --> 18:09.976
Oh, uh, sorry. We're not
going as a group.

18:10.010 --> 18:11.481
It's just a private friend

18:11.514 --> 18:12.983
who happens to know all
of us from different ways

18:13.016 --> 18:14.754
is throwing a private
birthday thing.

18:14.786 --> 18:16.491
Right, right, right.
Well, guys, I'd love to go

18:16.524 --> 18:17.526
to Bernie's with you.
But you know what?

18:17.560 --> 18:18.594
I have an office party.

18:18.627 --> 18:19.864
Big office party
I need to go to.

18:19.896 --> 18:21.333
So can't get out of it.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.570
Good job.
Hey, see you later.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.442
Nice job, Bill. Not.

18:25.475 --> 18:29.750
* Here I go again
on my own *

18:29.784 --> 18:33.325
* Going down the only road
I've ever known *

18:33.357 --> 18:36.798
Oh, hey, how's your new
side project going?

18:36.831 --> 18:38.935
Um, oh, yeah.
I gave that up.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.308
Really?
Yeah. It turns out
I was, um,

18:41.341 --> 18:43.512
just grasping at straws.

18:43.544 --> 18:45.715
Just because two people
are hanging out,

18:45.749 --> 18:47.853
it doesn't mean
that they're together.

18:47.886 --> 18:50.926
You know? Like people
can just be friends.

18:50.959 --> 18:52.763
And I think that it was
really unfair of us

18:52.796 --> 18:54.900
to assume that there was
anything else going on.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.477
* Just turn around now

18:59.509 --> 19:02.282
* 'Cause you're not
welcome anymore *

19:02.282 --> 19:04.453
* And I--
And I've got-- *

19:04.487 --> 19:07.860
Surprise!

19:07.892 --> 19:09.997
Everybody.

19:10.029 --> 19:13.002
Wow. Who opened the morgue
for this thing?

19:13.036 --> 19:14.640
I was just driving by.
Thought I'd drop in.

19:14.674 --> 19:16.711
Here's some wine.
I would love a glass

19:16.743 --> 19:17.780
if you're gonna open it.

19:17.813 --> 19:19.850
Hello, temp.
Take my jacket.

19:19.884 --> 19:21.688
Ha ha ha!

19:21.720 --> 19:24.994
Oh, come on. That guy?

19:25.026 --> 19:26.931
He is a good guy.
Not a terrorist.

19:26.963 --> 19:28.601
Yikes.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.837
Karaoke. I love it.

19:29.870 --> 19:33.412
I am a karaoke fiend!

19:33.445 --> 19:34.547
I call dibs.
I've got next.

19:34.579 --> 19:37.553
I got next up.
Come on. Let's--

19:37.585 --> 19:39.656
* Let's get
this party started *

19:39.689 --> 19:42.563
Ha! Okay.
Where's that wine?

19:42.595 --> 19:44.867
Okay. This is
a duet. So--

19:46.471 --> 19:48.908
Somebody else?
Pam, you want to...

19:48.942 --> 19:50.778
come up and sing
this one?

19:50.811 --> 19:54.018
Need somebody else.
Takers, please.

19:54.052 --> 19:58.495
* Baby, when I met you
there was peace unknown *

19:58.528 --> 19:59.530
Kelly?

19:59.564 --> 20:02.402
* I tried to get you
with a fine tooth comb *

20:02.402 --> 20:05.876
* I was soft inside

20:05.909 --> 20:09.081
* There was something
going on *

20:09.115 --> 20:13.089
This is the part
that goes to the girl.

20:13.122 --> 20:18.166
* You do something to me
that I can't explain *

20:18.199 --> 20:22.008
* Hold me closer
and I feel no pain *

20:22.041 --> 20:24.646
* Every beat of my heart

20:24.680 --> 20:28.587
* We've got something
going on *

20:30.725 --> 20:33.264
* Tender love is blind

20:33.296 --> 20:37.038
* It requires
a dedication *

20:37.071 --> 20:41.079
* All this love we feel
needs no conversation *

20:41.112 --> 20:45.219
* Divide it together,
uh-huh *

20:45.255 --> 20:48.927
* Making love
with each other, uh-huh *

20:48.961 --> 20:50.197
We're making love!

20:50.229 --> 20:52.603
* Islands in the stream

20:52.636 --> 20:54.839
* That is what we are

20:54.873 --> 20:56.910
* No one in-between

20:56.943 --> 20:58.782
* How can we be wrong

20:58.814 --> 21:00.818
* Sail away with me *

21:02.088 --> 21:03.857
Talk! Just talk!

21:03.892 --> 21:05.127
I am--
Shut up!

21:05.160 --> 21:07.331
Funny story--The way
I got into improv

21:07.365 --> 21:09.670
was--I got into improv--

21:09.703 --> 21:11.941
The story about me
getting into improv was

21:11.973 --> 21:13.912
that I was walking
down the street

21:13.945 --> 21:15.348
and a race car pulls up.

21:15.381 --> 21:17.786
And the guy says,
"Hey, you're funny.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.222
"You're the funniest guy
I've ever seen.

21:19.254 --> 21:21.326
Or my name is not
Dale Earnhardt."

21:24.031 --> 21:27.270
And th was an improv.

21:27.305 --> 21:29.309
Um, the real way was that
I found a flyer.
