00:05.092 --> 00:06.963
<i>- Previously</i>
<i>on "New Amsterdam"...</i>

00:07.007 --> 00:08.095
Your husband is very lucky.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.706
If only I'd met you
15 years earlier.

00:10.749 --> 00:13.013
- How does your girlfriend
have a residency slot here?

00:13.056 --> 00:15.015
I made a donation, okay?

00:15.058 --> 00:16.364
- You know,
when the staff finds out,

00:16.407 --> 00:17.843
you're gonna lose
all their respect.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.106
You already lost mine.

00:19.149 --> 00:20.498
If this child isn't yours,

00:20.542 --> 00:22.326
there's no shame
in stepping away.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.763
Lyn and I will be just fine.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.547
- You ordered another one?
- Yes, yes.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.288
- You know how many calories
this one has?

01:11.332 --> 01:13.029
No, get off!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.336
Oh, my God.

01:15.379 --> 01:18.208
This is amazing.

01:18.252 --> 01:21.777
- No more alcohol for you.
- Oh, come on.

01:45.017 --> 01:47.107
Hi, how are you?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.414
I smell of airplane.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.634
- I don't care.
Can we get out of here and--

01:52.677 --> 01:54.853
- Hold that thought
for a couple of hours.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.942
The next round's on me!

02:19.530 --> 02:22.359
- Oh, no way!
- Where are we going next?

02:22.403 --> 02:23.665
- You're ridiculous.
- No, I'm done.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.319
I might be done for good.
Lauren?

02:25.362 --> 02:27.277
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Elizabeth, I'm dying.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.757
- I can't.
- Oh, no, no.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.628
I'm dangerously close
to forgetting my own address.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.456
- His liver...
- Good night, everyone.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.936
- See ya, guys.
- Night.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.849
- No, even that's too loud.
- Oh, my...

04:44.893 --> 04:47.461
- What were we thinking?
- That we're still 28.

04:47.504 --> 04:48.853
But we're not.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.638
Anybody our at age
who drinks that much booze

04:50.681 --> 04:52.292
and thinks they still
can be okay is a liar.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.641
- Who's still got it?
We still got it.

04:53.684 --> 04:55.295
- What's up, fellas?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.948
- Why is everyone screaming?
- You guys are as bad as Helen.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.646
She couldn't even
get out of bed this morning.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.474
But I'm gonna need you to dust
off those cobwebs, all right?

05:00.517 --> 05:01.779
- Break through that wall, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.259
- How are you not nauseous
and dying?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.695
- Well, I've got English
tolerance now.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.306
More than that, I've got the
greatest hangover cure

05:06.349 --> 05:07.394
in the world--purpose.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.526
Today is a big day
at New Amsterdam.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.832
- Yeah, you don't work
at New Amsterdam.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.094
- Yeah, you work
at a third-tier

05:12.137 --> 05:13.922
urgent-care center
inside New Amsterdam.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.967
- Yeah,
but Urgent Medicine, Inc.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.534
has a, um, bold vision,

05:17.578 --> 05:20.320
not to mention a seat
on the board at New Amsterdam,

05:20.363 --> 05:21.582
which happens
to be meeting tonight.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.019
So tonight we're gonna
take Veronica down.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.455
- All right.
- Yeah.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.239
- Guys, guys, great news--
board meeting got bumped,

05:27.283 --> 05:28.763
so we get to go home early,

05:28.806 --> 05:30.504
and I can finally set
this taco hat on fire.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.375
"Bumped"?

05:32.419 --> 05:33.898
Today was my day.
It was my whole thing.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.509
- I was gonna do my whole...

05:35.552 --> 05:36.771
- Yeah, well it's gonna
have to wait two weeks

05:36.814 --> 05:38.599
till Veronica's back
from whatever conference

05:38.642 --> 05:40.078
is more important
than running this hospital.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.515
- What am I supposed to do
for two weeks?

05:41.558 --> 05:44.039
- Well, you do work
at Urgent Medicine, Inc.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.868
- Theirs is a bold vision.
- Thank you.

05:46.911 --> 05:49.697
- Look, I know that the clinic
may not be glamorous,

05:49.740 --> 05:52.352
but we get to help people,
so just grow up and--

05:52.395 --> 05:53.918
- Oh, God.
- Jeez.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.008
Um...

06:01.186 --> 06:03.101
That was close.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.235
What was that?

06:06.278 --> 06:08.455
- Well, if I'm ever gonna
get back together with Leyla,

06:08.498 --> 06:11.675
I have to make it crystal clear
that I am not pursuing her.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.852
I can't have fake accidentally
bumping into her, can I?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.941
- No, 'cause that
would make you look crazy.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.771
- Which way is
the stupid clinic anyway?

06:20.815 --> 06:22.512
- This way. We have to take
the service elevator,

06:22.556 --> 06:25.820
and we're not allowed
to talk to anyone.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.909
Help.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.650
Help.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.391
Can somebody help me?

06:31.434 --> 06:35.220
- Let's get him into a chair.
Sir, what's your name?

06:35.264 --> 06:38.049
Uh, Max...

06:38.093 --> 06:40.312
Max Bloomstein.

06:40.356 --> 06:43.141
- Um, why don't you
have a seat?

06:43.185 --> 06:45.796
- Okay, how were you injured,
Mr. Bloomstein?

06:45.840 --> 06:48.973
- I slipped in the shower.
Aah! Ah!

06:49.017 --> 06:51.149
- Let's get him
into a procedure room.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.629
Tachy's at 110.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.588
Let's hang a bag
of normal saline, wide open.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.546
- How's the wound look?
- Pretty extensive.

06:56.590 --> 07:00.550
And there's a superficial
retained object.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.035
- What is that?
- I don't know, an antenna?

07:07.078 --> 07:09.516
- Uh, all right,
uh, let's, uh--

07:09.559 --> 07:10.995
Tachy's up to 130.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.475
Let's hang a second bag
of normal saline, wide open.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.694
- I got it.
- Max...

07:13.737 --> 07:15.217
he's lost a lot of blood.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.740
- Yeah, he needs
a unit of packed red cells.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.089
- We don't have
anything like that.

07:18.133 --> 07:21.005
- No, but New Amsterdam does.
I'll ask Wilder.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.442
Excuse me.

07:25.183 --> 07:28.056
Hey, uh, Ben, Elizabeth's not
responding to any of my texts,

07:28.099 --> 07:30.014
and I really need a bag
of O negative.

07:30.058 --> 07:33.365
- Uh, I'll have some sent up.
- Great, thanks.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.020
- You okay?
- It's, uh...

07:36.064 --> 07:38.283
Five years of working together,
Elizabeth's never been late,

07:38.327 --> 07:39.807
not once.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.939
- Oh, well, she went pretty
hard at karaoke last night,

07:41.983 --> 07:43.724
so I'm sure
she's just sleeping it off.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.030
- Let me know.
- Mm-hmm.

08:00.741 --> 08:00.958
.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.483
- Just one patient left?
- Just got to wrap a cast.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.267
- Great,
that shouldn't take long.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.356
So, um...

08:07.399 --> 08:10.098
how do you feel about duets?

08:10.141 --> 08:15.320
Specifically "Reunited" or
"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"?

08:15.364 --> 08:17.192
- I'm not going
to karaoke night.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.890
- But everyone's going.
- Exactly.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.546
- Look, there's gonna be
so many people there,

08:23.590 --> 08:25.548
you probably won't
even see Dr. Bloom.

08:25.592 --> 08:26.767
- An old army buddy's
leaving town,

08:26.810 --> 08:28.029
and we're grabbing a drink,

08:28.072 --> 08:29.813
preferably where people
aren't singing.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.555
- Well, how about a drive-by?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.339
Well, that's what
it's called, right?

08:34.383 --> 08:36.516
When you just stop by...

08:36.559 --> 08:37.734
Please, just for me.

08:37.778 --> 08:40.302
- Fine, fine.
A drive-by.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.260
- Ah.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.785
- No singing.
- I'll take it.

08:45.873 --> 08:49.877
- Jiminy Constantinople?
- Yes.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.443
Hey, I'm Casey.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.577
I'll be wrapping your cast
this evening.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.332
- Hey, I got my digital card
right here.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.986
Just hang on.

09:12.029 --> 09:14.771
It's connected to this stupid
app that never frickin' works.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.429
Yeah, don't care, man.

09:20.472 --> 09:23.432
- Dude, I have two shots
and a booster.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.303
I-I'm a nurse at a hospital.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.740
- Like I said, don't care.
Go on in.

09:30.047 --> 09:34.617
- Um, I realize
the irony of this,

09:34.661 --> 09:36.663
but you really
shouldn't let anyone

09:36.706 --> 09:37.881
without a vaccine card in.

09:39.753 --> 09:43.191
- Casey in the house!

09:52.853 --> 09:55.246
I have never seen anyone
down three Flaming Zombies,

09:55.290 --> 09:56.726
and I'm Australian.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.075
- Yeah, please.
- Yeah, take it.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.425
Cheers.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.557
- Whoo.
- Nice.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.254
Whoo.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.778
- Oh.
- Hey, sorry.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.736
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.608
- Uh, it's just water, so--
- Okay.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.879
- How much longer?
- What?

10:18.922 --> 10:20.968
- How much longer
am I gonna be in the doghouse?

10:21.011 --> 10:23.013
Like, a month, a year?
Give me a ballpark figure.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.146
- Okay,
can we not do this here?

10:25.189 --> 10:27.061
I screwed up, okay?

10:27.104 --> 10:28.671
I know that I screwed up,

10:28.715 --> 10:30.847
but I'm doing everything I can
to make it right.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.633
You know I am.
I lost everything--

10:33.676 --> 10:38.376
Leyla, my job, my best friend.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.597
I'm a shell of a person now.
Is that not penance enough?

10:41.641 --> 10:42.772
No, it's not.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.644
- Why?
- 'Cause honor matters.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.602
What, are we in "Serpico"?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.212
Okay, now I'm leaving.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.345
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.694
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

10:51.738 --> 10:54.044
I know how you feel
about Sidney Lumet.

10:54.088 --> 10:59.006
I will do anything, anything
to get you to talk to me again.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.575
- Wear that hat
for the rest of the night.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.316
- Done.
- And all day tomorrow, too.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.797
- Absolutely not.
That is just bad doctoring.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.625
- Oh, maybe if you explain
to your patients

11:09.669 --> 11:11.018
why you're doing it,
they might smile.

11:11.061 --> 11:15.065
- Maybe even humanize you.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.327
Hi.

11:16.371 --> 11:19.548
Uh, I would like to purchase
the taco hat.

11:21.289 --> 11:24.118
- No, but you can win it
if you finish a fry bucket.

11:24.161 --> 11:28.209
- Why is it a taco hat?
- It just is.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.776
- Lauren, forget it.
I'm just being dumb.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.125
- No, never mind.
Let's do it.

11:31.168 --> 11:34.128
Let's get the hat down,
'cause honor matters.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.571
- No way!
That is ridiculous!

11:42.614 --> 11:43.833
- Where we going next?
I'm done.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.617
I might be done for good.
Lauren?

11:45.661 --> 11:46.706
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Elizabeth, I can't.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.055
- I dying.
- Oh, no, no.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.578
I'm dangerously close to
forgetting my own address.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.188
- I got to call it
for, like, my liver.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.451
- The livers--take care
of your livers, everybody.

11:53.495 --> 11:56.063
- Bye, guys.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.640
- And then he took out
the magazine...

12:08.684 --> 12:10.991
- Oh, and a gallon
of sand poured out.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.735
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, man.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.171
That fool's lucky to be alive.

12:17.214 --> 12:20.783
- Oh, we all are, man.
- Yeah.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.524
- Yo, man, it was so good
to hook up with you

12:22.567 --> 12:23.786
before you head out, bro.

12:26.093 --> 12:30.488
- Hey, um, Houston's
not happening, bro.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.099
What?

12:34.101 --> 12:35.580
- I don't want
to talk about it.

12:35.624 --> 12:38.192
- Well, how about that job
I hooked you up with, dude?

12:38.235 --> 12:40.847
Just leave it, okay?

12:40.890 --> 12:43.197
- Oh, listen, bro,
if you're scared of missing out

12:43.240 --> 12:45.721
on the support group,
I can find something out there

12:45.765 --> 12:47.201
that would--
Hey, man! Yo, whoa, bro.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.419
<i>Whoa, whoa, man.</i>

12:48.463 --> 12:49.812
Yo, hey, take it easy.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.118
Take it easy, man.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.207
- I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

12:57.646 --> 13:00.301
Ronnie, you high right now?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.348
Always on my case,
man, always.

13:04.392 --> 13:07.395
- Stop, stop, stop the car--
stop the car, man.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.962
<i>- Stop?</i>

13:09.005 --> 13:11.660
How fast you want to stop?

13:11.703 --> 13:14.010
- Ronnie, Ronnie,
to pull the car over now.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.055
Want to stop the car?

13:15.098 --> 13:16.447
You want to stop the car
so bad?

13:16.491 --> 13:18.841
Let's stop the car.
Casey, let's stop the car!

13:18.885 --> 13:20.103
- How much you want to stop?
- Ronnie, stop!

13:23.498 --> 13:25.935
- Hey, baby, I was just
thinking about you,

13:25.979 --> 13:28.242
so I made us a reservation
for tonight,

13:28.285 --> 13:30.592
somewhere, uh, cozy
and a little sexy.

13:30.635 --> 13:31.941
Max.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.377
- Uh, text me when you wake up.
Love ya.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.944
- I cut you off at "sexy"?
- Sure did.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.250
Sorry about that.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.947
I need you to sign off
on transferring

13:37.991 --> 13:39.601
Mr. Hoffstettington
to my floor.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.037
- Mister--
- Hoffstettington,

13:41.081 --> 13:44.040
aka Max Bloomstein,
aka Jiminy Constantinople.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.302
Right, right, right, right.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.131
Wait, uh, I thought
you already took him?

13:48.175 --> 13:51.265
- No, why would you think that?
- Be--

13:51.308 --> 13:53.354
- Oh.
Damn it.

13:55.225 --> 13:58.794
- He was just here.
- Where could he have gone?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.797
- Uh...
- Max.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.241
- Oh, my God.
- What?

14:11.285 --> 14:13.635
He's climbing.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.554
Look out.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.164
Casey, I ate the fries.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.862
I'm wearing
the stupid taco hat.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.341
You're supposed to be
talking to me again,

14:24.385 --> 14:25.995
not sending me to voice mail
every time I call.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.345
Where are you?
Call me back.

14:38.138 --> 14:38.355
.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.530
Hell, yeah.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.555
Oh...

15:04.599 --> 15:06.993
so you're the one
hogging the songbook?

15:07.036 --> 15:08.603
- I have so much
to narrow down.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.866
Why? Are you seriously
gonna sing another one?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.042
- Uh, Adele's
"A Million Years Ago,"

15:13.086 --> 15:15.958
but I need to know
what's after that.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.352
- I have to say,
I think this Urgent Medicine,

15:18.395 --> 15:20.354
New Amsterdam team-up thing
is so cool.

15:20.397 --> 15:23.357
I just--I love to see
everyone together.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.446
- No, look, I-I've been trying
to put together

15:25.489 --> 15:27.709
a karaoke night for years--
nothing.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.973
Elizabeth mentions it once,
half the hospital shows up.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.671
It's messed up.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.855
Why--why you looking at me
like that?

15:46.249 --> 15:48.643
- You're definitely
tan dominant,

15:48.686 --> 15:52.734
but there's encroachment
of red and blue in your aura.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.823
What?

15:54.866 --> 15:57.391
Your aura is troubled.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.917
I mean, I don't know
about troubled, but...

16:01.961 --> 16:04.789
- What if I could make you
feel better in five minutes?

16:10.056 --> 16:13.102
These are Vaccaria seeds.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.278
You place them
on pressure points

16:15.322 --> 16:18.064
along the earlobes
for ultimate clarity.

16:18.107 --> 16:19.587
All you have to do
is squeeze them.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.590
- Oh, my goodness.
- You try it.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.162
- This is insane.
- Right?

16:29.205 --> 16:31.642
- Yeah. Wow.
You ever do this on yourself?

16:31.686 --> 16:34.950
- Sometimes, but for clarity,
my go-to is meditation.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.604
It has to be on the water.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.693
Have you been to the pier
in Long Island City?

16:38.736 --> 16:40.129
- The new one?
No.

16:40.173 --> 16:43.089
- I love it so much.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.569
- Sorry. Hold on a sec.
- Yeah.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.927
You all right?

16:55.971 --> 16:58.452
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.541
- You look like
you could use a drink.

17:00.584 --> 17:03.109
I don't drink usually.

17:08.114 --> 17:11.595
Excuse me.

17:14.685 --> 17:18.080
- Oh, my God, no way!
That is ridiculous!

17:18.124 --> 17:20.082
- I'm done.
I might be done for good.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.475
- Lauren?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

17:21.518 --> 17:22.780
Elizabeth, I can't.
I'm dying.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.217
- Oh, no.
Oh, no.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.479
I'm dangerously close
to forgetting my own address.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.133
- I got to call it for,
like, my liver.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.177
For the livers, everybody.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.700
- Bye, guys.
- Love you, guys.

17:39.710 --> 17:40.972
- Hey!
- Whoa!

17:41.016 --> 17:42.626
- Hello.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.482
Hey, uh...

18:55.525 --> 18:58.398
Max or--or--or Jiminy
or whatever your real name is,

18:58.441 --> 18:59.747
please, come inside.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.967
- I couldn't do it.
I couldn't--

19:03.011 --> 19:04.752
- That's good.
That's good you couldn't jump.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.928
You're not hearing me.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.322
No psych ward.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.237
I can't be locked up.
I have to climb.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.890
- Okay, okay, you don't want
to be confined.

19:12.934 --> 19:16.198
I understand that. Just please
give me your real name, okay?

19:16.242 --> 19:18.113
Give me that.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.289
Just give me your first name.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.294
I have to climb.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.556
- No, no, you don't.
You don't.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.167
You have
a serious injury, okay?

19:28.210 --> 19:29.516
We need to come inside.

19:29.559 --> 19:32.214
- I can't go back.
I won't go back.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.955
- That's fine.
You don't need to go.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.913
Just--just tell me why.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.698
Okay?

19:37.741 --> 19:40.701
Just--just--just tell me why,
and I can try to help you.

19:42.311 --> 19:45.140
- The toilet.
- What--

19:45.184 --> 19:47.447
- Excrement
higher than the rim.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.797
People have weapons.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.278
They hurt you.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.585
You were in jail.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.718
I can't go back to Rikers.

19:57.761 --> 20:01.200
- Okay, Gustavo,
you're at New Amsterdam.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.898
You're not in Rikers.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.335
I will always be at Rikers.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.643
Wait, wait, wait.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.058
I want you to
give me your hand.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.452
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.541
Yes, you can.
Look at me.

20:38.585 --> 20:39.586
Hey.

20:41.370 --> 20:44.243
I'm right here.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.379
Please, give me your hand.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.650
- Out of the way! Iggy!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.435
I got you, I got you.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.176
Hey, hey,
what were you doing out there?

21:05.220 --> 21:07.396
- I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.268
I was climbing.
I was climbing.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.357
When I climb, I'm at peace.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.664
- I need
a full trauma team now!

21:18.407 --> 21:19.974
- You all waiting
for Dr. Castries?

21:20.017 --> 21:21.584
Yes, and I'm first.

21:21.628 --> 21:24.065
- Lady, no one is trying
to steal your spot.

21:24.108 --> 21:27.111
You stole my spot.

21:27.155 --> 21:30.506
- Uh, I just wanted to
quickly thank Mia for her help

21:30.550 --> 21:33.422
with some seeds, but it looks
like she's swamped.

21:33.466 --> 21:34.858
- She's not here.
She hasn't been in all morning.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.382
And she's not picking up
her phone.

21:36.425 --> 21:39.080
- Oh.

21:46.914 --> 21:47.306
.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.786
Very nice.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.746
Oh, very dignified.

21:52.789 --> 21:55.401
- Ah, yes, champagne.
It's my secret weapon.

21:55.444 --> 21:56.532
Has zero effect on me.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.142
I can drink this entire bottle,

21:58.186 --> 21:59.666
- which I will...
- Yes.

21:59.709 --> 22:03.234
- And, uh, still have 100%
mental clarity and judgment.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.932
- Since we're
telling secrets...

22:04.975 --> 22:06.542
- It's not exactly a secret,
but, yeah.

22:06.586 --> 22:09.371
- You're on my vision board.
- I was--

22:09.415 --> 22:11.373
- Oh.
- No, I'm--I'm serious.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.768
- Okay.
- I really admire you.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.640
You have it all and
make it look so bloody easy.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.164
Respected,
successful therapist.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.645
- Yeah, well, that's all--
that's very flattering, Trevor.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.517
- Thank you.
- No, I mean it.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.041
You--you're the full package,
Dr. Iggy Frome.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.696
Um...

22:31.306 --> 22:33.308
To, um...

22:33.352 --> 22:34.483
- to friendship.
- Yes.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.050
- Okay?
- Friendship.

22:36.093 --> 22:39.401
- Here we go.
- Count me all the way in.

23:08.996 --> 23:12.478
- Bartender, one extra-chilly
bottle of champagne

23:12.521 --> 23:15.742
for me, please,
and, um, a shot of your choice

23:15.785 --> 23:18.222
for the gentleman
in the green frock over there.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.137
Thank you.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.401
Gladys!
Gladys!

23:22.444 --> 23:24.881
Hi! Oh, my God.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.187
Oh, I love you.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.016
Oh, I love you, too, Iggy.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.147
- You do?
- Yes.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.978
- Which is why
I'm expressing my concern.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.459
- You are?
- You've had a lot to drink.

23:37.503 --> 23:38.982
Oh, please.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.332
First of all, champagne
has zero effect on me.

23:41.376 --> 23:42.769
Okay?
Facts.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.640
- This was made in New Jersey.
- Mm-hmm.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.512
The region of Nouvelle Jersey.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.252
It's wonderful,
wonderful new region.

23:48.296 --> 23:51.995
And, secondly, I, uh...

23:52.039 --> 23:54.171
I don't remember
what my second point was

23:54.215 --> 23:56.652
at this very moment, but
that may prove my first point,

23:56.696 --> 23:59.829
because maybe
there never was a second point.

23:59.873 --> 24:02.136
- Okay, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

24:04.181 --> 24:05.444
Hmm?

24:05.487 --> 24:06.880
Oh, that?

24:06.923 --> 24:08.490
That?
You're concerned about that?

24:08.534 --> 24:10.579
- Yes.
- Why?

24:10.623 --> 24:14.148
For what? What are--
Trev and I are, uh...

24:14.191 --> 24:15.845
We're here with colleagues.

24:15.889 --> 24:18.021
We're all here
having work drinks together.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.197
What are you--
we're rocking some 'raoke.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.939
And Martin, uh,
I would've invited him along,

24:22.983 --> 24:24.637
but he wanted
to stay home tonight.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.203
He wanted a night in.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.683
So you didn't invite him?

24:27.727 --> 24:29.293
- No, I didn't invite him,
okay?

24:29.337 --> 24:30.512
Because he literally said,

24:30.556 --> 24:32.166
"I would prefer
to stay home tonight."

24:32.209 --> 24:34.255
All right, would I have even
considered inviting him

24:34.298 --> 24:37.519
if I was hiding something?

24:37.563 --> 24:40.566
- Come on.
- Uh, no more alcohol for you.

24:40.609 --> 24:41.871
- Gladys, no, Gladys.
- Hey.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.394
- You are--hey, hey.
You are harshing my vibe.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.048
You're killing my vibe.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.703
- Your vibe has had two bottles
of very off-brand champagne.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.052
- It's not that off-brand,
and I like it.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.532
- Bartender,
cut off for the night.

24:50.576 --> 24:51.620
- No, no.

24:51.664 --> 24:52.752
- I'm not.
- Thank you.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.188
- That's ridiculous.
I'm not. I'm not.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.798
- He's done.
- I'm not--That's not my mom.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.682
- Oh, my God!
That's ridiculous!

25:09.725 --> 25:11.727
Where are we going next?

25:11.771 --> 25:13.555
No, look, I'm done.
I might be done for good.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.904
- Lauren?
- No, Elizabeth.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.037
No, I'm dying. I can't.
I can't. I got to go.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.517
- I'm dangerously close
to forgetting my own address.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.953
- I got to call it
for, like, my liver.

25:19.996 --> 25:21.911
- The livers--for the livers!
- See ya later.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.304
- Bye, guys.
- Love you.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.566
- See ya.
- Whoo!

25:24.610 --> 25:26.568
Oh, what a night.
What a night.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.614
- I didn't want that to end.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.833
Yeah, well, you know,
all good things, right?

25:30.877 --> 25:32.574
- Yeah.
- So till tomorrow.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.184
Till tomorrow, yeah.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.667
- I'm down here,
the uptown six.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.582
I'm six, downtown.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.192
- Same station.
- Different directions.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.585
Yeah.

25:43.629 --> 25:44.804
We're walking this way,

25:44.847 --> 25:45.892
so we can just
keep walking this way.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.502
- I mean, look-it,
we're already--

25:47.546 --> 25:48.938
- We're doing it.
- Hey!

25:48.982 --> 25:50.940
- Whoa! Hello.
- Watch it, lady. Damn.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.638
- That lady is
either incredibly drunk

25:52.681 --> 25:54.596
or just learning
how to ride a bicycle.

25:54.640 --> 25:58.034
- Or both of those things.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.775
Oh, my gosh.

25:59.819 --> 26:02.473
I don't remember the last time
I was out this late.

26:02.517 --> 26:03.605
- Oh, really?
- What time is it?

26:03.649 --> 26:04.911
I love the city at night.

26:04.954 --> 26:07.304
- I do, too, but,
you know, it's been a while.

26:07.348 --> 26:10.525
Believe it or not, there was
a time when, uh, yours truly

26:10.569 --> 26:12.788
took in more than
his share of sunsets--

26:12.832 --> 26:15.138
- sunrises, I mean.
- Oh, really?

26:15.182 --> 26:16.357
A bit of a party boy.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.793
No, no.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.490
- Yeah.
- No, not me.

26:19.534 --> 26:23.146
No, I was a--I was a good boy,
but I did get around, you know?

26:23.190 --> 26:25.801
Burned a hole in my Eurail pass
after college--

26:25.845 --> 26:27.760
- just go to a new city.
- Yeah.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.500
And I would just walk
into the night, you know?

26:29.544 --> 26:30.589
- Nice.
- I'd get lost.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.026
And I would just
meet these people.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.593
- Nice.
- It was great.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.772
It's not as great as you think.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.774
What, getting lost?

26:41.817 --> 26:43.558
No, I love that part.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.995
My, uh...

26:46.039 --> 26:47.649
my life.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.739
It's not as great as you think.

26:50.783 --> 26:54.047
The domestic parts,
they just--they just take over,

26:54.090 --> 26:58.660
and Mark and I rarely
go out anymore, if ever.

26:58.704 --> 27:02.316
The kids are just full--
full-time, man, you know?

27:02.359 --> 27:03.752
They're amazing.
They're amazing.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.275
They're amazing.
They're amazing.

27:05.319 --> 27:07.669
But spontaneity is
just out of the question.

27:07.713 --> 27:11.238
Even our responsibilities
have responsibilities.

27:11.281 --> 27:14.850
I love so much of it, you know?

27:14.894 --> 27:16.809
But I'd be lying if, um,

27:16.852 --> 27:18.854
I didn't say
that there are moments

27:18.898 --> 27:21.683
where I feel like
I'm missing something.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.468
Spontaneity.

27:24.512 --> 27:25.948
Yeah.

27:25.992 --> 27:29.299
Spontaneity feels like
a thing of the past.

27:31.388 --> 27:34.783
- Well, there's only one way
to find out.

27:44.227 --> 27:46.229
- He climbed up five flights
outside the building?

27:46.273 --> 27:47.709
Yep.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.711
- Looks like we're clear
of adhesions to the pancreas.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.583
- Hmm, good to go.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.542
All right, suction.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.677
I heard Lyn
started back up today.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.592
- Yeah, just part-time--I'm
sure she'll ignore that part.

28:03.420 --> 28:06.641
Also, I was offered
a chief of surgery position.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.731
Claude, that's fantastic.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.691
- Beaumont Medical
in Denver.

28:17.608 --> 28:18.871
So...

28:18.914 --> 28:21.395
- Yeah, we're moving
to Colorado.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.926
- They're very lucky
to have you.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.233
- Thank you, Floyd. Thank you.
- Yeah.

28:33.276 --> 28:36.018
- Suction.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.628
- BP's dropping.
- We got a bleeder.

28:37.672 --> 28:38.760
Lap pad.

28:45.985 --> 28:48.248
- Oh, there you are.
- Ah, uh...

28:48.291 --> 28:49.815
I need you to sign off

28:49.858 --> 28:51.773
on Julio Rilian Humperdink,
or whoever, ten minutes ago.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.644
- Right, yeah.
Sorry, that's my fault.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.342
I've been avoiding my office
all day.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.779
- That have anything to do with
yesterday's trip to Tipsy Town?

28:57.823 --> 29:00.521
- Um, yes, Gladys, it does.
You were right.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.044
I was making a fool of myself.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.394
- We're all entitled
to one of those--you're fine.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.788
Nothing you did at the bar
was beyond the pale.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.659
- Yeah, it's what happened
after the bar

29:08.703 --> 29:09.965
that I'm worried about.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.053
What?
What is this?

29:11.097 --> 29:12.838
- What's happening?
- We're backed up.

29:12.881 --> 29:15.666
We've been scrambling
without Trevor.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.886
- Where, uh--where is Trevor?

29:17.930 --> 29:21.237
- No idea.
Didn't come in today.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.457
- Uh-huh.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.286
- What happened
after you left the bar?

29:33.641 --> 29:33.772
.

29:44.391 --> 29:45.392
Mm...

29:53.269 --> 29:55.619
- Ouch.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.232
Yeah.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.667
- Mm-mm.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.157
Okay.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.469
- You--

31:06.865 --> 31:09.519
- Oh, my God!
No, that's ridiculous!

31:09.563 --> 31:11.043
Where we going next?

31:11.086 --> 31:12.479
Oh, I might be--
I'm done.

31:12.522 --> 31:13.959
I might be done for good.
Lauren?

31:14.002 --> 31:16.135
- Oh, no, I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
I'm dying. I can't.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.963
- I can barely remember
my own address at this point.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.529
- I'm gonna call
for, like, my liver.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.140
- For the livers, everybody.
- Bye, guys.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.055
- Good night, everybody.
- See ya.

31:28.016 --> 31:30.627
What an awesome night.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.716
Gladys cannot sing,

31:32.760 --> 31:37.808
- but she puts on quite the show.

31:39.419 --> 31:42.291
And you are awfully quiet.

31:42.335 --> 31:46.861
- Well, it could be the
singing or the drinking

31:46.905 --> 31:50.647
or the fact that I just really
want to get you home.

31:50.691 --> 31:53.085
Oh, fair enough.

31:53.128 --> 31:57.002
Well, here I am.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.394
- Wow.
- Whoo!

31:58.438 --> 31:59.743
- My goodness.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.571
- I had no idea.
- Yes.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.138
Is Luna home with the sitter?

32:03.182 --> 32:05.358
'Cause I really want to
wake her up with some kisses.

32:05.401 --> 32:07.882
- Yeah. No, she's with
Gwen and Calvin this weekend.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.624
- Oh.
I really miss my little girl.

32:10.667 --> 32:13.105
She misses you.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.542
- Well, maybe we can drive up
and see her?

32:15.585 --> 32:17.805
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should.

32:19.285 --> 32:20.851
- What?
- Sure you're okay?

32:20.895 --> 32:22.201
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

32:22.244 --> 32:23.854
Why do you keep asking me?

32:23.898 --> 32:25.160
Mm.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.466
Mm-hmm.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.642
Mm, mm, mm.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.298
- Wow.

32:32.341 --> 32:33.908
- You all right?
- Mm.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.997
It's just been
a really long night.

32:36.041 --> 32:39.914
- Well, booze and jet lag
and...

32:39.958 --> 32:41.829
That fourth shot
really didn't help.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.354
- I should get you to bed.
- Bed.

32:45.398 --> 32:46.573
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

32:46.616 --> 32:47.574
- Yeah.
- Sleep.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.184
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.620
No?

32:50.664 --> 32:53.406
- 'Cause I've waited
for tonight for a long time,

32:53.449 --> 32:55.060
and I'm not giving up now.

32:55.103 --> 32:57.758
So I'm gonna go in there
and get ready.

32:57.801 --> 33:00.369
And you're gonna come
join me in there.

33:00.413 --> 33:01.849
Be right there.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.159
Just be a minute.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.695
Okay.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.352
Do you want to--
do you want to--

33:26.395 --> 33:28.441
Do you want to get married?
I think we should get married.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.182
Do you want to get married,
because I--obviously I do,

33:30.225 --> 33:31.618
'cause I got the ring
and everything,

33:31.661 --> 33:32.923
and I was just wondering
if you did,

33:32.967 --> 33:34.186
'cause if you did, I would.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.797
Pop it out. Don't catch it.
That's stupid.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.278
Just open the frickin' thing.
There you go.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.540
But don't--What is that?

33:40.583 --> 33:42.020
Slow is nice.

33:44.761 --> 33:46.546
Can't even
open the thing--idiot.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.939
Just ask her.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.289
Simple.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.552
I--

33:54.510 --> 33:56.730
Will you marry me?

34:53.395 --> 34:55.832
Surgery went well.

35:00.402 --> 35:03.666
You know, you can tell me
your real name if you want.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.581
Secret's safe with me.

35:10.760 --> 35:14.808
Uh, so how long was
your sentence at Rikers?

35:18.507 --> 35:20.118
90 days...

35:21.771 --> 35:25.079
For writing one bad check.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.126
But COVID slowed my trial down,
and I couldn't make bail.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.651
I was in Rikers for six months.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.261
Wow.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.698
And I kept thinking

35:35.742 --> 35:37.526
someone would try
to come and get me.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.050
This can't be right.

35:40.094 --> 35:43.010
- Then you get out,
and you start thinking

35:43.053 --> 35:45.404
any second someone's gonna
come and take you back.

35:51.714 --> 35:54.804
- I keep hearing voices
in my head

35:54.848 --> 35:57.938
saying, "You're trapped.
You're trapped."

35:57.981 --> 36:01.463
And when the voices get loud...

36:01.507 --> 36:03.161
I have to climb.

36:05.989 --> 36:08.862
It's the only thing
that makes the voice stop.

36:14.607 --> 36:17.436
Here, I want you
to do me a favor.

36:17.479 --> 36:19.655
Take a picture.

36:19.699 --> 36:20.961
Don't think about it too much.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.310
Just pick anything in the room

36:22.354 --> 36:25.618
and snap an absolutely
incredible photo.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.881
Just do it--
simple assignment.

36:37.325 --> 36:38.848
Like this?

36:38.892 --> 36:41.286
You tell me.

36:41.329 --> 36:44.158
Is that the best photo
you can take of that window?

36:44.202 --> 36:46.813
Is the lighting good?
Is the framing good?

36:46.856 --> 36:49.032
I mean, it's dark in here.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.731
- All right, well,
I think we can handle that.

36:55.561 --> 36:58.781
Let there be light.

36:58.825 --> 37:00.609
All right, then you go ahead

37:00.653 --> 37:03.917
and you mess with
all the setting on there, okay?

37:03.960 --> 37:05.484
Go on.
Do your thing.

37:08.138 --> 37:11.054
The thing about climbing--the
only thing you can think about

37:11.098 --> 37:13.970
is where your hand goes next,
where your foot goes next.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.495
That's it.
If you don't, you fall.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.627
It doesn't allow you
to think about the past

37:18.671 --> 37:22.152
or anything else, really.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.719
Yeah.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.331
- Don't look at me.
Focus, you know.

37:26.374 --> 37:27.723
Literally, look.

37:27.767 --> 37:29.247
Your background's
getting all wacky.

37:29.290 --> 37:32.685
- The light's too high.

37:32.728 --> 37:35.514
All right, well, fiddle with
the lighting settings in there.

37:35.557 --> 37:36.689
That's on you, man.

37:38.647 --> 37:39.953
Like this?

37:39.996 --> 37:41.781
It's your picture.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.053
Not too bad.

37:53.096 --> 37:56.361
Actually, that's really nice.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.188
Thanks.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.147
Yeah.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.367
So, tell me, at what point
during that process

38:02.410 --> 38:04.412
did the voices
stop bothering you?

38:10.723 --> 38:13.421
How...

38:13.465 --> 38:15.902
how did that happen?

38:15.945 --> 38:19.253
- Well, trauma
locks you in the past.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.820
Climbing keeps you
in the present.

38:20.863 --> 38:23.213
That--that's not the only thing
that can do that, though.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.650
That camera,

38:24.693 --> 38:28.001
it doesn't see the past
or the future or anything.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.698
It just--it just sees
what's right in front of it,

38:29.742 --> 38:33.223
right here, right now.

38:33.267 --> 38:34.616
What do you see?

38:39.708 --> 38:43.103
Maybe you even see a way out?

38:43.146 --> 38:45.105
Not literally.
That window is locked.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.716
- So, you know...

38:54.027 --> 38:55.855
Gustavo Moro.

38:59.554 --> 39:02.209
- It's a pleasure to meet you,
Gustavo Moro.

39:15.483 --> 39:17.964
- Well, just call me
when you know.

39:23.491 --> 39:25.406
Why are you in a plant?

39:29.671 --> 39:31.934
I dropped something.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.110
Was it your taco hat?

39:34.154 --> 39:36.722
- Yes.
Found it.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.593
Okay.

39:38.637 --> 39:39.899
Good.

39:41.857 --> 39:43.903
I'm trying to give you space.

39:47.907 --> 39:50.475
I really want
to give you that...

39:50.518 --> 39:53.956
even if it means
hiding in a plant, so...

39:57.873 --> 39:59.440
Thank you.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.662
You okay?

40:06.055 --> 40:09.232
- There's a problem
with my visa.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.410
What kind of problem?

40:14.716 --> 40:16.588
I think I'm being deported.

40:22.202 --> 40:25.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.251
- So nice seeing you
around here again.

40:28.295 --> 40:31.472
- Floyd, I need to--
- It's all good.

40:31.516 --> 40:34.519
Claude already told me
about Colorado.

40:34.562 --> 40:35.868
He did?

40:35.911 --> 40:38.653
- Yes, and...

40:38.697 --> 40:42.222
You know, I'm happy for you,
for both of you.

40:42.265 --> 40:44.833
You know, you deserve
a fresh start together and--

40:44.877 --> 40:47.923
Stop, stop.

40:47.967 --> 40:50.186
What?

40:50.230 --> 40:52.319
The baby is yours.

41:01.110 --> 41:04.853
- You okay?
- No, I'm not.

41:04.897 --> 41:07.552
I'm getting hit from, like, a
thousand different directions.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.162
What's going on?

41:09.205 --> 41:12.774
- Well, for one thing,
Casey never showed up today.

41:12.818 --> 41:14.515
He's not answering his phone.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.910
- Well, they were
both drinking.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.913
- Who's they?
- Wilder.

41:20.956 --> 41:22.610
She never showed up either.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.918
Hey, have you heard
from Elizabeth?

41:25.961 --> 41:27.789
- Uh, or Casey?
- Uh, no, why?

41:27.833 --> 41:30.096
Neither of them came in.

41:30.139 --> 41:31.314
- That's weird.
Mia didn't either.

41:31.358 --> 41:33.229
- Hey, I got your page.
What's going on?

41:33.273 --> 41:34.622
- Half our karaoke party
is missing.

41:34.666 --> 41:38.800
- No Casey, Elizabeth, Mia.
- No Trevor.

41:38.844 --> 41:40.672
- All right, well,
this can't be a coincidence.

41:40.715 --> 41:43.326
- Did--did anyone speak
to any of them today?

41:43.370 --> 41:45.285
- No, and I've left Trevor
a ton of messages.

41:45.328 --> 41:47.374
- Okay, we were all
in the bar last night.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.115
Why is it just
those four missing?

41:52.248 --> 41:53.772
It's not just four.
