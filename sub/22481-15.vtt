WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.307
Previously onSWAT...I have a hard policy against

00:03.351 --> 00:06.963
dating cops, any cops anywhere.
Let alone on the same team.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.660
Who's Bonnie?I mentioned her, she...

00:08.704 --> 00:11.098
kind of stays at my place now,
sort of getting serious.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.708
So Bonnie wants to
seal the deal, huh?

00:12.751 --> 00:14.014
She wants me
to meet her parents.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.798
You don't want to marry
the wrong one.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.452
But you don't want
to be so scared

00:17.495 --> 00:18.975
that you, you don't marry
the right one, either.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.282
Not everything came up normal
in my checkup.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.848
You're pregnant?

00:22.892 --> 00:23.893
Aw...
DEACON:
She's pregnant.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.068
Again.Mm.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.493
BOY:
Oh, come on...For Javi.

01:20.689 --> 01:22.908
Jam. Switch.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.178
Transition drill complete.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.788
Make your weapons
safe and holstered.

01:32.831 --> 01:35.573
Damn, Deac. I see you putting
in work with that left hand.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.271
Good job.
Somebody's got

01:37.314 --> 01:39.664
a little extra pep in their step
today; I wonder why that is.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.013
Yeah.Hey, what?

01:41.057 --> 01:42.406
You didn't tell
these guys yet?

01:42.450 --> 01:44.234
Tell us what?Yeah, what's the word, Deac?

01:44.278 --> 01:47.629
Well, because of, uh, what
Annie went through last year,

01:47.672 --> 01:50.501
the doctor wants to induce
labor to avoid risks.

01:50.545 --> 01:53.548
So I'm gonna work a half
day and have a baby tonight.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.115
LUCA: Oh, whoa.
Congratulations, man.
Wow.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.769
TAN: Congrats.LUCA: Sure beats what
I got going tonight.

01:57.813 --> 02:00.207
Oh, yeah? What's that?I got roped
into hitting

02:00.250 --> 02:02.861
a single's bar with this
guy as his wingman.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.386
What? Valentine's Day
is a great time to meet girls.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.691
Or so I'm told.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.258
What about you, Chris?

02:08.302 --> 02:10.565
Hibachi and fondue with
Ty and Kiera, but let me know

02:10.608 --> 02:11.914
when it's a
good time to go

02:11.957 --> 02:13.350
visit my new goddaughter later.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.091
STREET:
Hibachi and fondue, huh?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.571
That sounds romantic.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.181
Where do you,
where do you go for that?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.530
Whipping it all
up at home.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.358
I've already spent too
much money on the gifts.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.360
It's Valentine's Day,
not an anniversary.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.710
It's expensive
dating two people.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.234
What about you?

02:27.277 --> 02:29.236
Word from Bonnie is,
you got a big night tonight.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.368
Yeah, I guess. Uh, dinner at
her favorite sushi place,

02:31.412 --> 02:33.588
maybe a moonlit
walk on the beach.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.590
What you got brewing
tonight, Hondo?Me?

02:35.633 --> 02:37.069
I got a little
something-something

02:37.113 --> 02:38.723
happening a little later
tonight, but that's all you get.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.117
I got to keep it
PG right now.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.771
Hey, kid.
Let's go, you and me.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.252
Head-to-head.What if I win?

02:45.295 --> 02:47.079
You might get
a box of chocolates.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.343
Better be heart-shaped. Let's go.

02:50.996 --> 02:53.260
HONDO: Okay, whoa, whoa.
Flag's up.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.436
Flag's up.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.614
Officer shot.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.832
Let's move.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.834
Move.

03:08.623 --> 03:09.754
DEACON: Central Division's
currently looking

03:09.798 --> 03:10.973
for multiple shooters.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.844
Search starting at
Lochlyn and Pacific.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.195
That's the rec center
in South L.A.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.109
They know if our guy
was undercover? Vice?

03:17.153 --> 03:18.633
Word I got is he
was a patrol cop

03:18.676 --> 03:20.548
on break, just parked.What?
Shot in his cruiser?

03:22.332 --> 03:23.899
We know our
guy's name yet?

03:23.942 --> 03:25.509
Not until the
family's been notified.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.642
All right, on my mark
we convene at

03:27.685 --> 03:29.687
mobile command on
Imperial and South Central

03:29.731 --> 03:31.689
one hour from now.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.606
Let's do
what we do best.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.217
His family's
counting on us.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.271
Got anything, Burrows?

03:48.315 --> 03:49.751
Multiple
bullet trajectories.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.709
Three shooters
on this hit.

03:51.753 --> 03:54.277
Witnesses either too far
or too scared

03:54.321 --> 03:55.670
to give us
any descriptions.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.846
We got casings going
to Ballistics?

03:57.889 --> 03:59.326
Didn't find
any casings, guys.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.023
So they used
revolvers.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.025
Sounds like
they had a plan.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.201
We're gonna lead the search
south of Jordan Downs.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.637
Copy that, hop in.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.204
You guys know
who the officer was?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.858
Pete Schwartz.Pete Schwartz?

04:09.901 --> 04:11.294
Yeah, uh, spent
the last two years

04:11.338 --> 04:12.643
with him at Central.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.210
Real hard charger, good dude.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.516
Has a wife and two kids.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.561
Paramedics say
he's 50/50.

04:18.693 --> 04:19.694
You know him?

04:19.737 --> 04:21.130
Yeah, I worked with him once.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.349
He come to you guys from

04:22.392 --> 04:23.698
the Street Crime Unit
in Glassell Park?

04:23.741 --> 04:25.047
Yeah.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.266
All right,
let's get going.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.879
LUCA: It's got to be
a local set to hit a rec center

04:30.922 --> 04:32.184
at peak hours
in broad daylight.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.621
Well, this is
Los Mags territory.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.884
Only group I can think of
brazen enough to do this.

04:35.927 --> 04:38.669
Glad we have you
to knock on their doors now.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.846
We canvassing security footage?

04:41.890 --> 04:44.719
Yeah, no cameras on any houses
and nearby buildings

04:44.762 --> 04:46.198
picked up anything.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.983
Our shooters might have been
casing our cop.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.898
Knew his rounds,
that he'd be here.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.378
Officer did
volunteer hours

04:51.421 --> 04:53.205
at the rec center for
Operation Progress.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.991
Whoever they are, the shooters
came and left on foot.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.906
Entry gate has a
license plate scanner.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.255
We already ran them
from earlier today,

04:59.299 --> 05:00.561
all came up clean.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.345
Then these guys
are long gone by now.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.738
And so far, no
one's talking.

05:03.781 --> 05:06.610
I know someone who will.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.096
Little Maurice got got?

05:14.139 --> 05:15.750
When that go down, man?

05:15.793 --> 05:17.142
Last week.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.144
Neighborhood newspaper
never lies, Hondo.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.408
Everything that happens
to or by Los Mags

05:21.451 --> 05:22.931
gets written
on that wall.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.672
Don't see
no cops' name, do you?

05:24.715 --> 05:25.977
You're telling me
this ain't even

05:26.021 --> 05:27.936
a set of Mags coming
out of Jordan Downs?

05:27.979 --> 05:30.678
Nah. Or a rival crew
in from Hacienda Village.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.114
I'd know, Hondo.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.811
Trust me,
we'd both know by now.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.291
All right, well, look,
somebody took down a cop, Trae.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.814
Now come on, man.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.599
Ain't a traphouse in Watts
you don't know about.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.296
So how come this one
got you stuck?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.863
Don't tell me you're losing
a step, man.

05:41.906 --> 05:44.126
Man, keep slander
out your mouth.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.955
Nobody got no beef with cops
in this area, Hondo.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.609
Wasn't no retribution.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.524
You reached out to
the Farmtown 12 in Nobu Gardens?

05:50.567 --> 05:52.003
Man, they reached out to me.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.136
Nobody want po-po coming around

05:54.179 --> 05:55.964
shooting first,
asking questions later.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.792
Things were
actually improving

05:57.835 --> 05:59.141
between us and the police.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.447
Ain't gonna be
that way no more.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.752
Not after this.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.058
And your boys coming at
everyone hard.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.973
Nah, nah, ain't gonna
let that happen, man.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.801
All right, I guess I'm
looking for a crew that

06:06.844 --> 06:08.933
got something more than gang
beef, but in the meantime,

06:08.977 --> 06:10.979
you keep your head low,
you understand me?

06:13.024 --> 06:14.939
My nephew's going to Verbum Dei.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.638
Been in Operation Progress
for two years on, praise God.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.857
I know that's right.He's gonna go to college, Hondo.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.033
That's the only game
I'm running right now.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.948
I'm proud of you, man.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.954
Hondo.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.696
The other search
areas are clear, too.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.045
No sign of our shooters.

06:34.089 --> 06:37.179
And I just got word
that Officer Schwartz

06:37.222 --> 06:39.616
passed away five minutes
ago at the hospital.

06:39.660 --> 06:40.965
Chief's with the
immediate family

06:41.009 --> 06:42.358
and assistant
chiefs and chaplain

06:42.402 --> 06:43.620
are taking them to MLK.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.492
Robbery-Homicide will
run point from now on

06:45.535 --> 06:46.884
out of our mobile command.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.147
We're gonna need
all hands on deck.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.845
We're also rotating Mumford
and Vandelli's teams in.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.546
WOMAN:
Officer.

07:01.508 --> 07:04.206
Be careful.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.642
CHRIS:
Captain.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.121
Just spoke with Hondo.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.167
Until RHD comes back
with intel on our shooters,

07:52.210 --> 07:53.821
I was gonna head over to MLK.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.779
Pay my respects
to the officer's family.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.085
You knew him?
Yeah.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.652
I did a stint with his
Street Crime Unit

07:58.695 --> 08:00.567
six years ago when I was K-9
in Glassell Park.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.959
I heard about that team.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.570
Made a lot of arrests.Yeah, I used Champ

08:03.613 --> 08:05.136
to sniff out drug hides
and stash houses.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.269
I spent the summer
with Schwartz and his team

08:07.312 --> 08:09.532
cleaning up that part of town.I didn't know that.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.360
I'm sorry this
hits close for you.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.884
Yeah. Schwartz was,
um, a go-getter.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.060
I didn't know
he went back to patrol.

08:16.104 --> 08:18.367
He was detective grade
back then.
A lot can happen

08:18.410 --> 08:20.717
in six years.
Never imagined
this, though.

08:20.761 --> 08:21.936
BURROWS:
Captain.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.546
Got a lead on our shooters.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.244
Hospital's gonna
have to wait.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.072
HONDO:
Mizael "Tuzo" Martinez.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.770
L2D gang leader
and multiple offender.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.554
You think this guy's
graduated from running drugs

08:31.598 --> 08:33.904
to being a cop killer?DEA reached out.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.732
Wire taps they got
from a joint task force

08:35.776 --> 08:37.517
have Martinez talking
retaliation

08:37.560 --> 08:39.954
for one of his captains getting
arrested a couple weeks ago.

08:39.997 --> 08:42.260
The arresting officer?
Pete Schwartz.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.262
They could have dropped us
a line if they thought

08:44.306 --> 08:46.177
something was up,
don't you think?
CHRIS:
What's more important

08:46.221 --> 08:48.397
to them, a cop's life
or building a RICO case?I get it.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.094
I think sharing this

08:50.138 --> 08:51.792
was the DEA's version
of an olive branch.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.184
JESSICA: Look, the
intel's promising,

08:53.228 --> 08:54.708
but if the recordings
are from two weeks ago...

08:54.751 --> 08:56.144
Could've taken him
this long to plan it.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.406
We definitely have
to talk to him;

08:57.449 --> 08:58.668
best lead we have so far.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.409
The word is, he stays
in the Kerlon block

09:00.452 --> 09:02.063
in Nobu Gardens;
that project's no joke.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.717
That's gonna be
a tough extraction.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.849
If he hasn't fled by now.BURROWS:
One of my CIs says

09:05.893 --> 09:08.199
he hasn't moved from
the area in the last 36 hours.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.897
Maybe he's making
himself visible there

09:09.940 --> 09:11.812
so he'd have an alibi.You think he'd
stick around

09:11.855 --> 09:13.683
city limits with this
much heat on him?

09:13.727 --> 09:16.033
No, running would
make him look guilty.One thing he is not

09:16.077 --> 09:17.252
is impulsive.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.906
He rarely leaves the block,
which is why

09:18.949 --> 09:21.212
it's been so hard for the feds
to make a case on him.

09:21.256 --> 09:24.564
Former World War II barracks
turned into a housing project.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.217
CHRIS: The
perfect bunker.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.218
LAPD's never raided
that compound

09:27.262 --> 09:28.611
in broad
daylight before.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.395
Considered it too dangerous.BURROWS:
Yeah.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.223
We can't do a
Contain and Callout.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.269
His homies have shot into crowds
before to get away from police.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.097
Yeah, and put bounties
on injured cops.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.882
Aero-sum game, but it gets you
a badge of honor in the pen.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.928
We need a plan that doesn't
give them time to prepare,

09:40.971 --> 09:42.582
or let lookouts warn
Martinez to run.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.193
Police presence is high
in that neighborhood.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.455
With our perimeter
just up the road,

09:46.498 --> 09:48.065
we'll look like
spillover from Watts.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.415
So, we come in from above,
we fast-rope down.

09:50.459 --> 09:53.593
I'll lead Red Team's staggered
entry, shallow to deep.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.682
And we use non-lethal
rounds for crowd control.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.205
That'll help us
get Martinez out.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.076
Blue team will pick
you up on the ground

09:59.120 --> 10:01.426
and bring you back here.
Let's go get him.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.435
PILOT:
Air 17 to Command.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.654
Inbound to location.

10:11.698 --> 10:14.918
D-Team be advised,
30 seconds to target.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.486
HONDO:
This is 20-David to Command.

10:17.529 --> 10:20.663
Exfil point clear on the Kerlon
block, northwest outlet. Copy.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.622
JESSICA :
Roger that, 20-David.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.362
Blue Team standing by
for your signal.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.154
DRUMMOND:
D-Team, go for entry.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.503
Ropes away.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.081
STREET :
Tan and I are secure
on the rooftop.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.691
Send down the gear.

10:53.522 --> 10:54.523
Got it.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.891
PILOT:
Chopper away.
We are go for ingress.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.424
Go, go.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.781
Freeze! Police!

11:34.824 --> 11:36.739
Tuzo Martinez,
you're under arrest!

11:36.783 --> 11:38.262
LAPD SWAT! Don't move!

11:38.306 --> 11:40.743
Turn around!
Get your ass down!

11:40.787 --> 11:41.788
Hands behind your back.
LUCA:
Give me your hands!

11:41.831 --> 11:44.051
TAN: Revolver.
Same as our shooter's.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.879
The serial number's been
filed off, that's illegal.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.489
Whose gun is this?

11:47.532 --> 11:49.230
What if I said it's mine?

11:49.273 --> 11:51.232
Then you'd be covering
for your dad.It ain't worth it, kid.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.625
Against the wall!
Is that
your dad's gun?

11:53.669 --> 11:55.366
Celebrating Valentine's
ain't illegal.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.194
LUCA: Stop resisting! Hey! Stop!Yeah.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.283
MARTINEZ:
Now show me a damn warrant.You're wanted for questioning

11:59.327 --> 12:00.807
in the death
of Officer Peter Schwartz.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.199
HONDO: This is 20-David
to Command,

12:02.243 --> 12:03.679
we have confirmation
on the package.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.594
Air 17, hold
your perimeter.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.161
Blue Team, we are go for exfil.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.292
Blue Team's 30 seconds out.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.946
Proceed to Kerlon and Pacific.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.909
What do we do with his girl?And the kid?

12:15.952 --> 12:18.781
ROCKER :
Hondo, we got a situation.

12:18.825 --> 12:19.782
Kerlon exit's blocked.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.875
I count 30, 40 hostiles
approaching from the north.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.486
Looks like everyone
knows we're here.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.315
DEACON:
Somebody's got eyes on us.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.972
There.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.800
There's a lookout
in the adjacent building

12:37.844 --> 12:39.715
with a two-way radio.HONDO: All right,
listen up.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.586
We're here for Martinez.
Leave the woman and kid.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.414
It's gonna be hard enough
getting him out of here.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.459
Deacon, take Chris.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.200
Contain that lookout,
get his radio.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.028
You're not taking me in, right?

12:50.378 --> 12:51.814
You know what?
Today's your lucky day.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.424
Why don't you work
on your taste in men?

12:58.125 --> 13:00.431
MARTINEZ: My boys ain't
gonna let you take me.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.998
Why don't you just
leave me here?

13:02.042 --> 13:03.608
Call it even.No chance.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.959
LAPD! Stay right there
with your hands in the air.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.308
Now! Do it now!

13:07.351 --> 13:09.136
JESSICA :
Command to Blue Team.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.312
Move to the southern end
of Kerlon to exfil the team.

13:11.355 --> 13:15.316
Hey, Luca, I got him. Get us out
of here. Let's go, go. Move.

13:15.359 --> 13:18.493
Street, go! Tan, move!Go, go, go, go, go!

13:18.536 --> 13:19.581
Move.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.933
DEACON:

13:23.977 --> 13:26.327
CHRIS:
Go. I got your back.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.851
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. Shh. Policia.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.551
Yeah, go.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.862
Police.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.472
Stop right there.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.953
Police!

13:43.997 --> 13:45.999
Hands in the air!

14:05.018 --> 14:07.237
All of you, back inside.What, pig?

14:07.281 --> 14:08.760
You gonna shoot an unarmed man?

14:08.804 --> 14:11.807
Or all 20 of us?Deac, fall back.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.550
Move, move, move.

14:15.593 --> 14:18.205
This is 20-David to Command.
Package en route.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.467
Let's go, let's go.

14:20.555 --> 14:21.948
ROCKER:
Bad news at the south exit.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.471
STEVENS:
No better on the north.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.039
We could use some help.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.139
51-David. Shots fired!
Shots fired!

14:41.184 --> 14:42.969
This is 20-David.
I need a visual on the shooter.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.492
Bald head.
Northwest!

14:44.535 --> 14:47.016
D-Team, maintain
non-lethal rounds.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.670
Teenagers and women
in the crowd.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.802
Street, move, go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.938
I got him.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.592
TAN :
25-David to Air 17.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.507
Got visual on a fire
coming from obstructions

14:59.550 --> 15:01.161
at the southern
exfil point. Copy.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.076
Air 17, have visual
on multiple barriers

15:03.119 --> 15:06.383
blocking ingress. No ground
access to your position.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.820
Repeat, no ground access
to your position.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.738
He's stalling.
Waiting for his homies.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.393
I'll drag him out of here
if I have to.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.004
LUCA: Hondo, I'm clocked
at 70-80 bangers

15:18.047 --> 15:21.007
approaching from the south. We
got hostiles on both ends now.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.573
HONDO :
This is 20-David to Command.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.053
The alley is blocked.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.099
Roll Armored to the northwest
side of Craddock Avenue.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.578
Meet you there with the package.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.276
On your feet.

15:37.501 --> 15:40.461
LAPD! Get back!Don't move! On the ground!

15:40.504 --> 15:42.245
LUCA:
Get back! Now! Now!

15:42.289 --> 15:44.508
Against the wall. Come here.
Against the wall, now.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.904
Hondo, we need
an exit plan, now.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.648
Do not come closer!Get back now!

15:59.349 --> 16:00.524
Back up, back up.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.183
HONDO:
Here we go.

16:07.227 --> 16:10.143
Three, two, one...Get down!

16:10.186 --> 16:11.927
Breach!

16:11.971 --> 16:13.407
Go, go, go, go, go!

16:13.450 --> 16:14.538
Move, move.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.759
Hold it right there!

16:19.239 --> 16:21.719
Move, come on! Through the hole!

16:21.763 --> 16:23.025
Let's go, let's go.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.597
Do not move! Do not move!

16:29.640 --> 16:32.513
Y'all treating me
like the president.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.559
DEACON: Back up! We can't
hold them. There's too many.

16:39.476 --> 16:42.566
Retreat, Deac!
Fall back to exfil!

16:42.610 --> 16:43.828
Fall back!

16:46.918 --> 16:48.050
Get in here!

16:48.094 --> 16:49.312
Go, go!

16:52.489 --> 16:55.579
This is 20-David,
package secure.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.668
D-Team is clear.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.106
Headed back to base.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.123
Makes you think about what's
really important, doesn't it?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.472
You mean, getting
the guy responsible

17:18.515 --> 17:20.474
for putting one
of us in the dirt?

17:20.517 --> 17:24.434
That, plus sometimes
you take things for granted.

17:24.478 --> 17:28.830
You forget it can all be gone,
in one moment.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.745
It's been, like, over a month

17:30.788 --> 17:33.356
since I spent some
quality time with my pops.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.966
You should invite him
over to the house.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.707
Think I will.

17:36.751 --> 17:39.145
What's going on with your mom?
I mean, you see her lately?

17:39.188 --> 17:41.625
We're still
not talking.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.627
Hey. Your girl
blowing up your phone?

17:43.671 --> 17:45.499
Yeah, especially with her
watching the news and all.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.153
Yeah, you can't blame her
for being worried.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.806
Yeah, it's gonna be
a big relief for her

17:48.850 --> 17:50.504
when I walk through
that door tonight.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.941
Hell, yeah. Especially with you
popping the question, huh?

17:52.984 --> 17:55.074
What? No.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.119
Dude, Bonnie's been
texting us on the DL.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.121
She's reading into
this big production.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.210
She's expecting you to get
on one knee tonight.

18:01.254 --> 18:03.256
You telling me
that's not happening?

18:03.299 --> 18:04.822
No.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.390
You had her move in with you
after five months,

18:07.434 --> 18:09.610
she came to Deac and
Annie's vow renewals,

18:09.653 --> 18:11.307
and now you're taking her to
her favorite sushi restaurant

18:11.351 --> 18:12.961
before a moonlit walk
on the beach

18:13.004 --> 18:14.310
on Valentine's Day?

18:14.354 --> 18:16.791
That's leading the witness,
playboy.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.749
I mean, yeah, we're-we're
headed in that direction,

18:18.793 --> 18:21.100
but I wasn't gonna
propose any time soon.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.275
Okay, what did you
get her tonight?

18:22.318 --> 18:24.755
A teddy bear.
A teddy bear?

18:24.799 --> 18:26.801
It's big.
Oh, my...

18:26.844 --> 18:28.237
You're just gonna
wreck this whole thing.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.500
It's all right,
Street and I got a couch

18:30.544 --> 18:32.981
with your name on it
when she kicks you out.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.680
MARTINEZ:
Swear to God,

18:36.724 --> 18:38.639
I'm gonna pop a cap
in that pig's face

18:38.682 --> 18:41.642
so his mother can't have an
open casket for his sorry ass.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.861
JESSICA: That's after
Officer Schwartz

18:43.905 --> 18:46.299
arrested one of your captains
a couple weeks ago.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.909
In addition
to the two counts

18:47.952 --> 18:49.476
of illegal handgun possession
we've got you on, that recording

18:49.519 --> 18:51.304
will play well for a jury

18:51.347 --> 18:52.827
on capital murder
of a police officer.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.699
Mm-hmm.
Ese,that's just talk.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.614
I ain't dumb enough
to go after no cop.

18:57.658 --> 18:58.920
That's a death sentence.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.835
Where were you at 10:18
this morning, then?

19:00.878 --> 19:05.187
At home, in my living room,
watching some game show.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.536
Got anyone to confirm that?

19:06.580 --> 19:07.842
Nah, querida.

19:07.885 --> 19:10.149
My son wasn't back
from school.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.542
My old lady,
she hadn't come by yet.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.109
Help yourself out.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.590
Tell us where your
two accomplices are hiding.

19:16.633 --> 19:19.767
So you're telling me that
I couldn't pull off a hit alone?

19:19.810 --> 19:23.988
If I need to handle a grudge,
I roll solo, dawg.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.252
You think this is funny,
circus freak?

19:26.295 --> 19:29.603
Hey! I lost a captain
to you fools,

19:29.646 --> 19:33.520
so I was mad.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.826
Being pissed at pigs
ain't a crime.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.872
I was fronting for my jainas.

19:37.915 --> 19:40.614
Spitting big game,
you know.

19:40.657 --> 19:43.051
Acting hard.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.923
You just happened
to catch me playing.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.316
BURROWS:
Yeah, I don't think so.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.275
Your alibi is weak.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.724
This is for Javi.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.997
Help me!

20:18.391 --> 20:19.566
BURROWS:
It's only a matter of time

20:19.609 --> 20:20.784
before we catch your buddies

20:20.828 --> 20:22.873
and they give you up.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.745
Another cop just got shot now.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.230
How's my alibi
look for this one?

20:37.975 --> 20:39.325
HONDO:
It's the same group
of shooters.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.631
Witness saw two of them flee
on foot down Rossmore.

20:41.675 --> 20:44.112
Cop winged the third, suspect
fled into an office nearby

20:44.155 --> 20:45.287
and he's hiding out inside.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.767
The owner said
the office is closed.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.551
Should be empty,
no innocents involved.

20:48.595 --> 20:51.380
However, the business
is Assault Rifle Technologies.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.990
It's a weapons R&D site.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.296
HONDO: Shooter may have
grabbed up more guns,

20:54.340 --> 20:55.558
so be ready
for anything.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.081
The best efforts
to take this guy alive

20:57.125 --> 20:58.735
so he can lead us
to the other shooters.

20:58.779 --> 21:01.347
We get an ID
on the second victim yet?Not yet,

21:01.390 --> 21:03.392
but he's Hollywood Division
and we all got friends there.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.394
Where they transporting him to?St. Mary's Hospital.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.570
Two cops in one
day, same MO

21:07.614 --> 21:09.006
Who says it's gonna stop there?

21:30.463 --> 21:32.813
Guess there's no way
to stop the alarm now.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.858
No. It sure looks like
he tried, though.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.254
He in?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.864
No.
Okay.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.217
Nothing.

22:00.057 --> 22:03.452
Bathroom's clear,
but our shooter's been here.

22:06.107 --> 22:09.023
Looks like he downed the whole
bottle of rubbing alcohol.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.895
Be advised, our shooter
may have some pep to him.

22:11.939 --> 22:14.550
Four, four. Four.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.774
Whoa!

22:20.817 --> 22:23.385
22-David, suspect's got
an automatic weapon!

22:23.429 --> 22:24.908
Headed to the second floor!

22:59.900 --> 23:01.205
Move.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.643
Cover, cover, cover!

23:09.518 --> 23:12.695
This is 20-David to Command,
be advised,

23:12.739 --> 23:15.568
suspect is headed down the exit
stairwell to the back alley.

23:30.713 --> 23:31.714
Drop the gun!

23:31.758 --> 23:34.543
Face down on the ground, now!

23:34.587 --> 23:36.545
Get down on the ground!

23:36.589 --> 23:38.373
Do not make
us shoot you!

23:54.389 --> 23:55.825
Had to put him down.

23:58.001 --> 24:01.527
There goes our lead
on the other two shooters.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.625
Hey, honey, how are you feeling?

24:12.668 --> 24:14.104
ANNIE :
I'm fine.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.933
Just worried about you.
This thing is all over the news.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.326
You know I can be
right over there.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.459
Have you found the guys
responsible yet?

24:20.502 --> 24:22.765
Not all of them.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.550
Well, then your team
needs you more than I do.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.465
Besides, the doctor
hasn't even induced yet,

24:26.508 --> 24:29.293
and as we remember
from the last two go-arounds,

24:29.337 --> 24:31.295
I was in 12 hours of labor
each time.

24:31.339 --> 24:32.906
My mom's on her way

24:32.949 --> 24:36.126
to keep me company,
so you do what you got to do.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.477
I'll see you when you get done.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.479
I love you so much.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.958
Love you, too.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.220
I'll be there soon.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.269
JESSICA: Deacon, Luca and Tan
will lead this sector's search

24:48.312 --> 24:50.010
here for the other two shooters.

24:50.053 --> 24:53.448
A security camera at an ATM
on Romaine and La Brea

24:53.492 --> 24:55.711
caught two guys fitting
our witness's description

24:55.755 --> 24:57.974
going behind this
auto body shop.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.367
And that's where
we go blind.

24:59.410 --> 25:00.673
No security cameras
beyond that point.

25:00.716 --> 25:03.763
Copy that, thanks.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.591
Captain, I just
heard the ID

25:05.634 --> 25:07.288
on the second cop
is Marc Walters.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.637
You knew him, too?

25:08.681 --> 25:11.510
Anything special
about Walters and Schwartz?

25:11.553 --> 25:14.469
They were on the same
Street Crime Unit

25:14.513 --> 25:16.384
I worked back in Glassell Park.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.212
They were hotshots.
The commander in their division

25:18.255 --> 25:21.345
loved them, they were making
arrests, so everyone was happy.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.957
But you looked at it
differently.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.133
Cards up, uh,

25:26.176 --> 25:28.875
I was casually dating a member
of the team at the time.

25:28.918 --> 25:31.486
There would be
a big takedown of a dealer,

25:31.530 --> 25:33.662
and suddenly, my boyfriend
would be sitting on some cash.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.577
He would talk about
bringing me in on something,

25:35.621 --> 25:37.623
but I got a bad vibe
about it all.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.929
I broke up with him
and transferred out of there.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.714
Well, it sounds like you did
the right thing.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.759
I had a sense they were
all up to something,

25:43.803 --> 25:45.456
but each of them outranked me.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.154
I had no proof,
and the commander,

25:47.197 --> 25:48.851
you know, he could've made it
really hard for me

25:48.895 --> 25:50.636
if I came forward.You were a woman

25:50.679 --> 25:52.159
trying to make your career.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.378
And it's not like you had
any intel to go to IA with.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.990
Wasn't your job
to police them.

25:57.033 --> 26:00.384
At the time, my instinct was
just to get away from it.

26:00.428 --> 26:04.563
But I can't help feeling like
I should've come forward then,

26:04.606 --> 26:06.695
'cause maybe I could've
stopped all of this.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.392
So you think these shooters
are targeting

26:08.436 --> 26:10.569
the old Street Crime Unit.The other two guys,

26:10.612 --> 26:12.048
David Wong and Clark Thompson,

26:12.092 --> 26:13.876
I've got outdated contacts
for them.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.183
I can't raise
either one, but...

26:16.226 --> 26:18.664
...what if one of them's next?

26:18.707 --> 26:19.708
We'll scoop them up.

26:40.424 --> 26:42.513
DEACON: David Wong,
it's LAPD.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.124
Please open the door.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.910
Uh, be right there!

26:56.310 --> 26:58.442
Whoa, SWAT. Hey.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.793
Officer Wong,
are you home alone?Yeah, yeah, I'm alone.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.098
Thanks for coming.Listen,
we've got reason

27:02.142 --> 27:03.665
to believe that
your life is in danger.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.275
So we're gonna escort you
to Metro headquarters.

27:05.319 --> 27:08.017
All right. Uh, yeah, come in.
Let me get my stuff.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.501
Luca, Tan, we're Code 4.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.460
30-David to Command,
Wong is secure.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.201
STREET:
26-David to Command,

27:18.245 --> 27:20.247
we're just rolling up
on Thompson's place.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.167
Door.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.995
Go, go, go.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.787
Clark Thompson?

27:38.831 --> 27:41.442
LAPD. Are you home?

27:52.496 --> 27:55.630
This is LAPD Chris Alonso!

27:55.674 --> 27:56.718
Clark, can you hear us?

28:05.945 --> 28:07.903
26-David to Command.

28:07.947 --> 28:12.473
No sign of Thompson.
House looks broken into.

28:12.516 --> 28:15.041
Phone got left behind.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.739
We know he didn't report to his
division at shift an hour ago.

28:17.783 --> 28:20.263
So he's officially missing.

28:20.307 --> 28:21.395
Chris.

28:25.094 --> 28:26.617
You think our killers
got to him?

28:40.588 --> 28:41.894
JESSICA: We've
got a patrol unit

28:41.937 --> 28:43.852
staked outside your place,
keeping an eye on it

28:43.896 --> 28:45.854
in case the shooters come by.Thank you.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.334
Appreciate it, guys.Did you know

28:47.377 --> 28:48.727
that two of your former
colleagues were killed today?

28:48.770 --> 28:50.163
Heard about
Schwartz earlier,

28:50.206 --> 28:52.556
then about Walters just
before you guys showed up.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.863
Have you reached out to
the fourth member of your
old crew, Clark Thompson?

28:54.907 --> 28:56.822
I tried to call him,
but couldn't get him.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.606
Any idea what this is about?

28:58.649 --> 29:00.564
CHRIS: When I was working
Glassell Park with you,

29:00.608 --> 29:02.044
I got a sense
that with Thompson,

29:02.088 --> 29:03.872
maybe things weren't
always aboveboard.

29:03.916 --> 29:07.354
Could something he did have
triggered these attacks today?

29:07.397 --> 29:10.400
No. No way.
We made a lot of good busts.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.228
Not everyone might have
looked at them that way.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.577
HONDO: Seems like Thompson's
been living pretty well.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.231
Especially for a guy
on a detective's salary.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.798
He runs a PI firm on the side.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.060
Consults here and there,
I heard.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.410
I saw up-close
how he ran that SCU.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.804
Singlehandedly set a record
for arrests in Glassell Park.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.240
HONDO: Do you think
it's possible

29:24.284 --> 29:25.633
that he jammed up a few people

29:25.676 --> 29:27.635
who didn't deserve it?Come on, guys.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.289
When you're effective,
you make a bunch of dirtbags

29:29.332 --> 29:30.769
and their pals unhappy.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.031
I'm sure someone started
spreading the word

29:32.074 --> 29:33.597
that we did this
or we did that,

29:33.641 --> 29:35.382
'cause they wanted nothing
more than getting us

29:35.425 --> 29:37.384
off our beat. I mean, just look
what happened to that part

29:37.427 --> 29:39.952
of town after we left.JESSICA: You had
an impressive record.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.258
Some might say too impressive.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.434
Look.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.654
If I knew something
that could stop people

29:46.697 --> 29:50.310
from coming to kill me,
believe me, I'd tell you.

29:52.312 --> 29:54.270
BURROWS:
Captain.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.185
Got a possible ID
on one of our shooters.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.328
If Chris is right
about Wong and Thompson,

30:08.371 --> 30:10.286
I got a bad feeling
this could blow up even bigger.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.114
After everything we've
done to improve relations

30:12.158 --> 30:13.681
between the police
and the community,

30:13.724 --> 30:14.813
this could set it all back.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.118
BURROWS: Ran the
serial number

30:16.162 --> 30:17.816
of the revolver
from our dead suspect.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.513
Came back as one of three stolen

30:19.556 --> 30:21.471
from a local fence out
of a Whittier pawn shop.

30:21.515 --> 30:23.952
Clerk cooperated, gave us
a positive ID on this guy.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.432
Hector Ledesma.

30:25.475 --> 30:27.956
Two priors
for petty theft and burglary.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.131
Address is a house
in Baldwin Hills.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.480
All right,
I want a 500-foot perimeter

30:30.524 --> 30:31.917
around that house
before we breach.

30:31.960 --> 30:32.874
I'll brief my guys.

30:39.185 --> 30:41.840
Give me a two,
give me a two!STREET: Two, two, two.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.496
CHRIS:
Give me two!

30:46.540 --> 30:49.108
Chris. The basement.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.901
LUCA:
LAPD SWAT!

30:59.945 --> 31:02.817
Come to the bottom of the stairs
with your hands up!

31:02.861 --> 31:04.558
Hector Ledesma!

31:11.347 --> 31:12.653
You're not Hector Ledesma.No.

31:12.696 --> 31:13.872
Hector's my son.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.050
Who did this to you?

31:18.093 --> 31:20.313
Officer Thompson.
Clark Thompson.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.271
He was here?He threatened
to kill me

31:22.315 --> 31:24.578
if I didn't let him know
where Hector was hiding.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.536
Then he left
me for dead.LUCA: So Thompson

31:26.580 --> 31:28.277
and his men did something
to your son, didn't they?

31:28.321 --> 31:30.236
Yeah, but not the son
you're thinking of.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.499
You want Hector.LUCA:
Yeah.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.501
But you should have
brought Javi back to me.

31:34.544 --> 31:36.329
Who's Javi?
My other son.

31:36.372 --> 31:39.810
He died in prison last week.

31:39.854 --> 31:42.030
In a riot.LUCA: What was he
doing time for?

31:42.074 --> 31:44.380
You tell me.

31:44.424 --> 31:47.035
Thompson and his
guys took him.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.994
They used my boy.

31:49.037 --> 31:51.735
He did nothing wrong,
he was a good kid.

31:51.779 --> 31:55.565
Then they framed him, they
took his pot and sold it.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.219
It wasn't just my son
this happened to.

31:57.263 --> 31:59.874
They jammed up a ton of kids
in this neighborhood.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.572
When did this happen, then?Five, six years ago.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.009
He was innocent.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.924
He didn't deserve to go to jail.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.664
But you know what your other
son's been up to, right?

32:07.708 --> 32:09.057
Killing two cops?

32:09.101 --> 32:11.233
I couldn't stop him
or his friends.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.582
But you could've come
to the police.

32:12.626 --> 32:15.542
You have any kids, Officer?No.

32:15.585 --> 32:18.414
Not yet.Then you don't know
what it's like to lose one.

32:18.458 --> 32:22.070
LUCA: Look, I
get your pain,

32:22.114 --> 32:24.029
I get what these guys did
to your neighborhood,

32:24.072 --> 32:27.075
but this is not how you fix it.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.948
Where is your son
and his friend hiding?I don't know.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.950
Thompson took my phone,
and he made me call Hector.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.082
That's the last
thing I remember.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.431
So he could track
Hector's signal,

32:35.475 --> 32:37.433
get a bead on the location
of their hideout.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.566
Look, you should've come to us,
okay? We could've helped you.

32:39.609 --> 32:41.133
I should trust cops?

32:44.832 --> 32:47.791
Come on. Get up.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.576
LUCA:
Hondo, we're coming up!

32:51.621 --> 32:54.102
Hey, what happened to Wong?

32:54.146 --> 32:55.364
Said he was going for a smoke
out in the motor pool.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.192
When was this?Maybe a half hour ago?

32:57.236 --> 33:00.021
I was just in the motor pool
and he wasn't there.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.370
Nobody said I was supposed
to keep an eye on him.

33:01.414 --> 33:04.373
You weren't.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.731
Why'd you have me
meet you here?

33:14.775 --> 33:17.865
Got some intel that paid off.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.914
The guys trying to kill us.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.046
What are you gonna do with them?

33:25.090 --> 33:26.787
We're gonna take them
to my office.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.745
Make it look like they
were coming for us,

33:28.789 --> 33:31.226
but we got the drop
on them first.

33:31.270 --> 33:32.967
Otherwise, everything's
gonna come out.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.064
CHRIS:
With our cops looking for
the shooters and the shooters

33:43.108 --> 33:44.674
looking for our cops, they're
on a collision course.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.241
Yeah, I'd hate to think
what could happen

33:46.285 --> 33:47.764
in those neighborhoods if Wong
and Thompson get ahold of

33:47.808 --> 33:49.288
these guys and try to
cover up what they did.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.768
Okay, the last ping
from Wong's cell phone

33:51.812 --> 33:53.074
came from a freeway off-ramp

33:53.118 --> 33:54.771
in Canoga Park
before the signal died.

33:54.815 --> 33:57.078
Probably destroyed the phone
before we could track him.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.601
We've already been
to Wong and Thompson's houses.

33:58.645 --> 33:59.994
Where else would
the shooters go looking?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.213
They went after
the first two cops

34:01.256 --> 34:02.388
while they were
on their beat.

34:02.431 --> 34:04.085
Thompson's PI firm,

34:04.129 --> 34:05.913
which is probably a front

34:05.956 --> 34:07.262
so he can launder money
and live in style.

34:07.306 --> 34:08.481
JESSICA: Guy had a choice.
Went the wrong way.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.309
HONDO: Yeah, so did his buddies.
They thought

34:10.352 --> 34:11.875
they were above the law--
it's a good thing

34:11.919 --> 34:13.181
they never came
to my neighborhood.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.617
BURROWS:
The address for the PI firm

34:14.661 --> 34:16.184
is six blocks south of where

34:16.228 --> 34:18.012
Wong's cell signal died:
De Soto and Saticoy.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.058
Check it out.We go in stealth.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.674
Let's go.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.458
Get up.
Come on.

34:36.552 --> 34:37.597
Shut up.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.120
Dispatch.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.600
Dispatch, this is 20-Lincoln-30.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.515
Went by my off-duty
place of work.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.125
There's a break-in.
15821 Saticoy.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.519
Send backup.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.998
Roger, 20-Lincoln-30.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.478
1-1-4 is already on site.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.480
Negative, Dispatch.
This is not an open call.

34:51.524 --> 34:52.829
We're the only officers

34:52.873 --> 34:54.004
currently at location.

34:54.048 --> 34:55.267
Standing by. Over.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.138
I repeat, 1-1-4 is on site.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.140
LAPD SWAT will advise
at location.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.663
Dispatch,
I didn't call it in yet.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.665
That's 'cause I did.
LAPD SWAT. Drop the gun.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.885
Both of you!
Drop your guns now!

35:04.928 --> 35:06.321
THOMPSON :
Hey.

35:06.365 --> 35:07.888
You got it. The gun.

35:10.891 --> 35:13.502
We caught these guys
red-handed, all right?

35:13.546 --> 35:15.069
Trying to come in here
and waylay me.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.636
Lucky my buddy Wong
was here.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.159
We took 'em down.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.335
Yeah, we were
just calling it in.Nice try, guys.

35:20.379 --> 35:22.032
Hey, Chris.

35:22.076 --> 35:23.033
Good to see you.

35:23.077 --> 35:25.558
Damn, you look fly in full tac.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.691
Been a long time.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.911
Not long enough.
I know what you did.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.828
What did I do?You jammed up

35:34.871 --> 35:37.744
innocent people.
Like his brother.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.180
THOMPSON: His brother
was a junkie,

35:39.224 --> 35:41.139
not some innocent.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.141
He had no priors.
Just a pothead.Don't defend

35:43.184 --> 35:45.360
these lowlifes, Chris.And the
legit busts?

35:45.404 --> 35:46.666
You palmed the goods

35:46.709 --> 35:47.971
and sold 'em off to, uh,

35:48.015 --> 35:49.277
float your lifestyle.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.323
WONG:
Just wait a second.
Hold on. Guys.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.586
We're all
on the same team here, right?Hell no, we're not.

35:53.629 --> 35:56.066
His brother died in the pen
because of you.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.330
Hey, Chris, come on.

35:58.373 --> 35:59.592
You know me.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.681
Yeah, deep down I did know you.

36:01.724 --> 36:04.510
I should have done something
about it six years ago.LUCA: All clear.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.342
Turn around.
Turn around.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.647
Hands behind
your back.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.345
You're both under
arrest for the murders

36:13.388 --> 36:15.173
of Officers Pete Schwartz
and Marc Walters.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.251
You okay?

36:50.295 --> 36:51.948
Yeah, it's just

36:51.992 --> 36:53.907
this job is hard enough
as it is, and even harder

36:53.950 --> 36:56.257
when you got a few bad apples
in your own ranks, you know?

36:56.301 --> 36:59.042
There's a lot more of us
than there are of them.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.044
But they were protected
along the way,

37:01.088 --> 37:03.786
or turned a blind
eye to, even by me.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.441
I was in the Crime
Unit six years ago

37:06.485 --> 37:08.051
when I started
dating Thompson.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.966
He was this...

37:10.010 --> 37:14.057
hotshot cop, and I guess
I was, um... impressed.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.277
Like everyone else,
I didn't think too much

37:16.321 --> 37:17.974
about how he was
getting it done.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.454
I...

37:19.498 --> 37:21.978
I could have stopped
all of this.
No.

37:22.022 --> 37:24.024
You're being way
too tough on yourself.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.991
He's the reason
I don't date cops.

37:46.525 --> 37:50.050
WOMAN :
Anesthesiology to OR Three
for emergency surgery.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.530
Anesthesiology to OR Three
for emergency surgery.

37:54.097 --> 37:56.143
This'll all be over really soon,
okay?
Okay.

37:56.186 --> 37:57.231
What's happening?

37:57.275 --> 37:58.798
She has a placental abruption.

37:58.841 --> 38:00.365
We're prepping
for an emergency C-section.

38:00.408 --> 38:02.149
Why didn't you call me?'Cause I

38:02.192 --> 38:04.847
didn't want to worry you,
again. I'm gonna be okay.

38:04.891 --> 38:08.024
And the baby?We'll know soon.

38:14.335 --> 38:14.901
Bonnie.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.642
Hey.
Hey.

38:16.685 --> 38:18.513
How you doing?

38:18.557 --> 38:20.341
Good.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.822
I should've texted,
I know, I just...

38:22.865 --> 38:25.346
I really needed to see your face
after everything today.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.653
How's Annie doing?
Is she in labor yet?

38:27.696 --> 38:28.915
I think everything's
on track.

38:28.958 --> 38:31.004
Mm. You got that
for the baby?

38:31.047 --> 38:32.353
Oh, no, I got
him for you.

38:32.397 --> 38:33.876
Or, um, maybe
it's a her.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.052
I don't know. Are these
things, uh, asexual?

38:38.272 --> 38:40.361
I know, teddy bear's
a lousy gift, um...

38:40.405 --> 38:42.798
you were probably expecting
something more meaningful...

38:42.842 --> 38:44.844
significant...

38:44.887 --> 38:46.280
permanent.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.980
You mean like
an engagement ring?

38:51.024 --> 38:53.766
I don't know.
Maybe?

38:53.809 --> 38:55.376
Were you expecting
such a thing?

38:55.420 --> 38:56.812
Unbelievable.
What?

38:56.856 --> 38:58.771
I think your friends
are messing with us.

38:58.814 --> 39:00.729
Who, Luca?
And Street.

39:00.773 --> 39:02.731
I've been getting
all of these weird texts

39:02.775 --> 39:03.906
from the two of them,

39:03.950 --> 39:05.517
asking all of these theoreticals

39:05.560 --> 39:07.954
about how serious
we were getting.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.172
They've been telling me

39:09.216 --> 39:10.173
you thought I was
gonna propose tonight.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.610
Wh... No.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.873
That was totally
taken out of context.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.354
I just said
that's the kind of thing

39:16.397 --> 39:18.399
a lot of people do
on Valentine's Day.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.055
I'm lucky you're not like
a lot of people.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.883
Yeah, I guess maybe

39:23.926 --> 39:25.667
they were trying to push
us together a little.

39:25.711 --> 39:26.668
Like they think...

39:26.712 --> 39:28.148
We should end up together.

39:28.191 --> 39:29.497
Eh, could be worse.

39:29.541 --> 39:30.498
Your friends could hate me.

39:30.542 --> 39:31.847
Who could hate you?
Hmm.

39:31.891 --> 39:34.154
Trust me, I've made
a few enemies in my time.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.416
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see
'em try and get through me.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.897
My hero.

39:37.940 --> 39:41.596
Well, thank God that's settled.

39:41.640 --> 39:45.731
To be honest, Luca had me
high-key terrified

39:45.774 --> 39:47.297
that you were gonna
pop the question tonight.

39:47.341 --> 39:48.647
Wait. Terrified?

39:48.690 --> 39:50.257
I've got my period

39:50.300 --> 39:52.172
and I'm, like, so bloated I
feel completely unattractive.

39:52.215 --> 39:53.173
Oh, please.

39:53.216 --> 39:54.435
You look amazing.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.219
And a woman
should feel beautiful

39:56.263 --> 39:58.657
when someone proposes to her.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.833
Uh...

40:02.051 --> 40:03.575
Oh, no.
What?

40:03.618 --> 40:05.490
Annie's having some kind of
complication with the birth.

40:05.533 --> 40:06.969
Hondo's getting the team
together at the hospital.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.275
Okay, go.
Yeah.

40:08.318 --> 40:09.450
Text me what's happening.I will.

40:09.494 --> 40:10.451
Hey.
Yeah?

40:10.495 --> 40:11.713
Leave the bear.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.976
He's totally punk rock
and he's all mine.

40:24.247 --> 40:26.946
You know I totally want
to end up with you, right?

40:26.989 --> 40:28.513
I know.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.167
Maybe you'll even deserve me.

40:34.954 --> 40:37.783
: Waiting really
isn't my strong suit.

40:37.826 --> 40:39.437
Aw, come on, now.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.308
Annie's tough-- she's gonna
pull through for both of them.

40:41.351 --> 40:42.483
LUCA: Hey, you still
got some time, man.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.137
Fix that gift situation
with your girl.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.182
Uh, for your information,
she loved the teddy bear

40:46.226 --> 40:48.968
and despite your best attempts
to trick Bonnie and me

40:49.011 --> 40:50.186
into getting engaged,

40:50.230 --> 40:51.579
we're gonna move
at our own speed.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.842
Plus, I booked us a trip
to wine country next week.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.975
Not bad. Way to score some
points at the last minute.TAN: You think so?

40:56.018 --> 40:57.933
I was worried
it might come off as desperate.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.457
Nah. Hitting a singles bar
with a colleague

40:59.500 --> 41:01.197
on Valentine's Day is desperate.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.678
Tactical.Whatever you say, man.

41:12.818 --> 41:14.123
Hey.

41:14.167 --> 41:15.995
Deac.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.953
What's the word?

41:17.997 --> 41:20.521
Her name is
Victoria Josie Kay.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.392
She's eight pounds
four ounces,

41:22.436 --> 41:23.481
and she's fine,
and Annie's fine.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.308
Baby girl in
the building!Yeah!

41:25.352 --> 41:27.833
Congratulations.I want her to meet her
new family. Come on.

41:27.876 --> 41:29.008
Congratulations.And her new godmother.
