38:38.577 --> 38:40.361
TO FIND SAM.

38:40.535 --> 38:41.710
YEAH? HOW?

38:41.884 --> 38:42.842
CALL HIM?

38:43.016 --> 38:45.453
I ALREADY TRIED THAT.
THANKS.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.803
YOU...CALLED FOR SAM.

38:47.977 --> 38:49.631
I THINK YOU NEED
TO CALL FOR YOUR FATHER.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.720
HE'S NOT...MY FATHER.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.418
HE'S NOT YOUR ONLY FATHER,

38:53.592 --> 38:55.115
BUT HE IS STILL,
IN FACT, YOUR FATHER.

38:55.289 --> 38:56.290
YOU'RE CONNECTED.

38:56.464 --> 38:58.858
AT LEAST
AS A WHITELIGHTER.

39:01.556 --> 39:02.601
DAD?

39:10.435 --> 39:11.784
PAIGE.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.355
UH...

39:18.747 --> 39:20.967
OK, EVERYBODY,
LET'S BACK UP.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.796
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
SOME COMPANY.

39:26.538 --> 39:28.235
Vaklav:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.674
HOW DID YOU FREE THEM?!

39:32.848 --> 39:36.852
OOH. I DIDN'T.
SHE DID.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.464
I GUESS MY WHITELIGHTER SIDE
IS STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.076
UHH! OHHH...

39:46.601 --> 39:47.646
SMILE.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.691
NO!

39:55.784 --> 39:58.613
I THINK I'LL HAVE
THIS ONE FRAMED.

39:58.787 --> 40:00.485
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

40:03.357 --> 40:05.228
HMM.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.371
YOU MAY AS WELL SHOW UP.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.852
I KNOW YOU'RE LURKING
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

40:21.854 --> 40:24.204
NOTHING WRONG
WITH THOSE WHITELIGHTER
INSTINCTS OF YOURS.

40:26.989 --> 40:28.774
FIGURED YOU'D
WANT TO TALK.

40:28.948 --> 40:29.992
UH, ACTUALLY,

40:30.166 --> 40:32.299
I...WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE.

40:32.473 --> 40:33.909
FOR...?

40:35.345 --> 40:36.521
FOR BEING
SO HARD ON YOU.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.305
PAIGE, LOOK, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO, UH--

40:38.479 --> 40:39.524
YEAH, ACTUALLY...

40:40.612 --> 40:41.700
I DO.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.354
GUESS I HADN'T
REALIZED HOW MUCH...

40:44.529 --> 40:46.879
YOU KNOW, IT HURT
ME--THE WHOLE...

40:47.053 --> 40:48.315
NOT-SHOWING-UP
THING.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.751
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

40:49.925 --> 40:53.233
I SHOULD'VE COME BY
LONG AGO. BUT...

40:53.407 --> 40:57.890
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO YOUR
REAL FATHER'S MEMORY, I...

40:59.674 --> 41:03.373
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
HOW I FIT IN.

41:05.201 --> 41:07.508
WELL...I THINK
THERE'S ROOM

41:07.682 --> 41:09.423
FOR BOTH OF YOU
IN MY LIFE.

41:12.208 --> 41:13.471
AGENT MURPHY MANAGED
TO TRACK DOWN

41:13.645 --> 41:16.038
ALL THE INNOCENTS'
FAMILIES?

41:16.212 --> 41:17.083
YES, HE DID.

41:17.257 --> 41:18.824
I THINK
IT'S SAFE TO SAY

41:18.998 --> 41:21.043
MR. SAWYER GOT
THE SHOCK OF HIS LIFE.

41:21.217 --> 41:23.350
IT'LL BE
A TOUGH ADJUSTMENT.

41:23.524 --> 41:24.830
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.615
YEAH. UNFORTUNATELY,
NOT FOR J.D.

41:27.789 --> 41:29.399
OH, I WOULDN'T BE
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

41:29.574 --> 41:30.923
IT MIGHT'VE TAKEN HIM
AN EXTRA 50 YEARS,

41:31.097 --> 41:32.446
BUT I THINK
HE FINALLY MANAGED

41:32.620 --> 41:34.274
TO PROVE HIMSELF
A FUTURE WHITELIGHTER...

41:34.448 --> 41:37.059
BY SAVING
ANOTHER. YOU.

41:40.236 --> 41:41.455
SEE YOU AROUND?

41:41.629 --> 41:43.501
DEFINITELY.
