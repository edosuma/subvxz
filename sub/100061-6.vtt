19:57.413 --> 20:01.069
And Marion, she hated
the foot traffic of my clients

20:01.112 --> 20:02.113
coming and going.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.463
So because we
share this wall,

20:03.506 --> 20:06.335
she used to crank the volume
of her TV so loud,

20:06.379 --> 20:08.511
my clients, they couldn't relax.

20:08.555 --> 20:11.384
I've lost most
of my business.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.386
She called Child
Protective Services on me.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.997
Said she hadn't seen my
third-grader in months,

20:16.040 --> 20:18.260
that I was
locking him up.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.261
♪ Constantly grown...

20:19.305 --> 20:20.828
He was at summer camp.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.873
EMILY:
Todd works late most nights.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.223
I'm a bartender.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.225
Doing the Lord's work, my man.

20:26.268 --> 20:30.098
Right. But every night
when Todd would come home,

20:30.141 --> 20:32.274
she would call me up, screaming

20:32.318 --> 20:34.363
about how he'd woken her up when
he came in through the gate.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.235
No one else complained.
I swear she'd sit up

20:36.278 --> 20:37.888
just waiting for me to get back

20:37.932 --> 20:39.673
so she had something
to raise a stink over.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.501
Well, last night,
when he came in at...

20:41.544 --> 20:42.676
What time was it, honey?

20:42.719 --> 20:44.460
Around 12:45?

20:44.504 --> 20:48.247
EMILY:
Right. Anyway, it was
the first time Marion

20:48.290 --> 20:51.554
didn't complain,
and, I mean, now I get why,

20:51.598 --> 20:52.555
of course.

20:52.599 --> 20:55.166
12:45, you say?

20:55.210 --> 20:56.298
TODD:
Yeah.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.257
Why?

20:58.300 --> 21:01.782
Todd, I'm gonna need to speak
to you outside, please.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.916
What-What's going on?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.919
Hold up, homes. So you want to
good cop/bad cop this or what?

21:08.963 --> 21:10.094
Officer Liu.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.748
This is Todd.

21:11.792 --> 21:14.577
Todd just told us that he didn't
get home from work last night

21:14.621 --> 21:17.450
until 12:45 a.m.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.453
Well, that's interesting.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.368
Wait, why is that interesting?

21:22.411 --> 21:23.760
Because we know for a fact

21:23.804 --> 21:25.588
that no one entered the building
after 11:30 p.m.,

21:25.632 --> 21:27.851
which means you're busted.So busted!

21:27.895 --> 21:29.853
TODD:
Okay, look,

21:29.897 --> 21:31.594
I should've just come out
and said it.

21:31.638 --> 21:36.120
Every Tuesday I tell Emily
I'm working late, but I'm not.

21:36.164 --> 21:40.864
Instead of going home,
I go to another apartment.

21:40.908 --> 21:41.909
A neighbor's apartment.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.345
Sounds scandalous, dude.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.520
QUINN:
What is it that
you're doing

21:44.564 --> 21:45.739
at your neighbor's
apartment, Todd?

21:45.782 --> 21:48.524
Please, you can't tell Emily.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.918
TANI:
This is where
you were

21:50.961 --> 21:52.615
last night?Yeah.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.051
Playing Dungeons & Dragons.

21:54.095 --> 21:56.358
It was a pretty
epic campaign.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.055
My mage cast
an Arcane Hand spell.

21:58.099 --> 22:01.058
My friend Reko, who lives
here, can back me up.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.669
I headed home as soon
as we wrapped things up,

22:02.712 --> 22:04.235
which was about
a quarter to 1:00.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.585
Well, that was
right around the time

22:05.628 --> 22:07.195
that Marion was murdered.
Did you happen to notice

22:07.238 --> 22:10.546
if anyone was coming or going
from any of the apartments?

22:10.590 --> 22:12.069
Uh, no.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.115
Um, I did hear something.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.203
TANI:
Please don't kill
each other.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.726
Noises.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.424
Like a weird clanking sound.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.555
I didn't really think
about it, though.

22:19.599 --> 22:20.643
I just wanted to get home.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.429
If Emily found out I was here...

22:23.472 --> 22:25.344
She and Reko sort of had
a falling out last month.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.867
It got pretty ugly.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.042
I'd rather not go into it.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.826
We'd rather
you not go into it either.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.568
So Reko confirms
Todd's alibi,

22:32.612 --> 22:34.265
but that means Emily
doesn't have one.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.571
It's like whack-a-mole.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.747
[chuckles]
Classic ref, Officer Liu.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.140
Also, I got to say,

22:39.183 --> 22:40.750
I thought turning bros
and broettes onto

22:40.794 --> 22:43.013
a career in law enforcement
would be a hard sell.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.102
I mean, you guys
are the ones

22:45.146 --> 22:46.756
who bust up
our house parties

22:46.800 --> 22:48.541
and arrest us
for indecent exposure.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.281
Hoping that last one
is hypothetical.

22:50.325 --> 22:53.284
His point is, this job
is actually kinda rad.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.938
And, plus, unlike
our boy Duke...[phone chimes]

22:54.982 --> 22:56.505
you guys get to wear
your own threads.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.464
Everything okay?

22:58.507 --> 22:59.726
Um, no.

22:59.769 --> 23:03.077
Noelani just sent me this.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.774
Guys, seriously?

23:04.818 --> 23:06.515

23:06.559 --> 23:08.430

on the murder weapon.

#MurderAndMayhem."

23:11.781 --> 23:12.782

23:12.826 --> 23:14.262
SCOOTER:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.133
You guys said no photos
or videos of the crime scene.

23:16.177 --> 23:19.659
That dude's apartment is
crime-scene-adjacent at best.

23:21.661 --> 23:22.836
So, we good?

23:25.752 --> 23:28.145
Oh, it's no imposition
at all, dear.

23:28.189 --> 23:29.669
You two go deal
with your police work.

23:29.712 --> 23:30.974
I'll take care of the boys.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.150
SKEEZ:
Harsh punishment, dude.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.979
Who's up for a game
of gin rummy?

23:36.023 --> 23:37.807
TANI:
Behave yourselves, bros.

23:37.851 --> 23:40.201
Still a fan
of Scooter and Skeez?

23:44.074 --> 23:46.250
Why don't you just ease back
a little bit,

23:46.294 --> 23:47.382
so KITT here
doesn't make us.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.557
KITT?

23:48.601 --> 23:50.298
It's KITT from Knight Rider.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.604
You don't know
what Knight Rideris?

23:51.647 --> 23:52.866
Of course I know
what Knight Rideris.

23:52.909 --> 23:53.780
I used to watch it--
I love Knight Rider.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.700
Here we go.
Here we go.

24:00.743 --> 24:03.267
[tires screeching]

24:03.311 --> 24:05.269
DANNY:
Well, I'd say they made us.

[siren wailing]

24:06.532 --> 24:09.012
Lou, you seeing this?GROVER: Oh, yeah.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.187
Yeah, that sure
escalated quickly.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.059
STEVE:
Yeah, it did.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.756
Lou, notify HPD.
We're gonna need a roadblock.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.192
GROVER:
All right, will do.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.415
DANNY:
This car's gonna get
someone else killed.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.856
[car horn honking]

24:28.858 --> 24:30.077
Why? Why?

24:30.120 --> 24:31.513
I don't want to lose KITT.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.906
DANNY:
But KITT is
a worse driver than you.

24:32.949 --> 24:34.560
Plus, there's a
tracker in the car.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.300
STEVE:
I know there's a tracker
in the car, Danny,

24:36.344 --> 24:38.215
but what if we lose the car
and the car stops

24:38.259 --> 24:39.956
to make another sale
and the next

24:40.000 --> 24:41.523
customer swipes the bag?
Then what?

24:41.567 --> 24:44.526
You're a catastrophist.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.441
A catastrophist?Mm-hmm.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.747
Wow, you're really
making the most

24:47.790 --> 24:49.400
out of that "word of the day"
calendar, huh?

24:49.444 --> 24:51.968
It means that you expect
the worst at all times.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.753
I know what it means,
but you're wrong.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.016
I plan for the worst,
and there's a difference.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.365
Right, and excuse me

24:57.408 --> 24:59.454
if I trust my eyes
more than a computer chip.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.027
Whoa.[tires screeching]

25:14.600 --> 25:16.993
And they say self-driving
cars are safer.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.609
Wow.

25:23.652 --> 25:26.612
That's great...
that's great.

25:26.655 --> 25:29.092
How are we supposed to get
anything off of that car now?

25:29.136 --> 25:30.746
Says the catastrophist.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.532
Catastrophist...
How is this a good thing, Danny?

25:33.575 --> 25:35.577
I don't know,
if we keep this up,

25:35.621 --> 25:37.100
they're gonna
run out of cars, right?

25:46.196 --> 25:49.112
Yo, HPD recover that car?
Yup.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.375
We ain't been able to get
anything off it, though.

25:51.419 --> 25:54.596
It's weird, but when you take
a plunge off a 100-foot cliff,

25:54.640 --> 25:58.034
all you end up with is pretty
much a self-driving pancake.

25:58.078 --> 26:01.690
However, the first car, the one
involved in the hit-and-run,

26:01.734 --> 26:03.605
well, they got a good
look under that hood,

26:03.649 --> 26:06.695
and it seems that
its operating system

26:06.739 --> 26:09.568
is some proprietary software

26:09.611 --> 26:12.614
that's owned by a company called
Tropovision Technologies.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.311
I heard of them.
They make drones, right?

26:14.355 --> 26:15.965
GROVER:
Yeah, they do, but now

26:16.009 --> 26:17.793
they've taken that tech
and adapted it

26:17.837 --> 26:21.492
to cars you can
control remotely.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.103
Well, I've heard of corporate
diversification, but

26:23.146 --> 26:26.062
seems highly unlikely that
a fancy tech company like that

26:26.106 --> 26:28.630
would get into
delivering drugs.Right.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.589
So what do we think?
Somebody stole the software?

26:30.632 --> 26:32.460
Yeah, and we have
a pretty good idea who.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.070
Julia Wahea.

26:34.114 --> 26:36.725
Runs R&D at Tropovision.
She's some kind of

26:36.769 --> 26:39.119
whiz kid, basically invented
this software herself.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.990
And what's the company say?They were unaware

26:41.034 --> 26:42.252
of any breach
when I called them,

26:42.296 --> 26:43.514
but they've since confirmed that

26:43.558 --> 26:45.342
an unauthorized download
of the code did occur.

26:45.386 --> 26:46.648
All right, so-so why
do we think it's Julia?

26:46.692 --> 26:47.867
Because they used

26:47.910 --> 26:49.433
her credentials
to log in and download it.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.652
That's a good reason.

26:50.696 --> 26:51.610
Let's bring her in.

26:53.307 --> 26:54.961
QUINN:
Thank you.

26:57.485 --> 26:58.617
Anything?

26:58.660 --> 27:00.749
Stop me if this
sounds familiar.

27:00.793 --> 27:04.013
Marion had Mr. and Mrs. Puleha's
water turned off

27:04.057 --> 27:05.536
because she could
hear Mr. Puleha

27:05.580 --> 27:08.322
singing in the shower. You?

27:08.365 --> 27:09.932
About the same.
Marion would steal

27:09.976 --> 27:12.239
Mr. Jonathon in 4C's
pizza deliveries.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.110
I'm starting to think
this killer's gonna get off

27:14.154 --> 27:16.243
on just cause.SCOOTER: Officer Rey!

27:16.286 --> 27:17.897
Officer Liu! Up here!

27:17.940 --> 27:19.333
What the hell
are you doing up there?

27:19.376 --> 27:23.337
You're supposed to be with Rose.Totes true,

27:23.380 --> 27:26.166
but there's something
you got to see up here.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.776
L-Like, now.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.611
QUINN:
This better be good.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.569
Oh, it is,
Wonder Women.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.180
Okay, let me set the scene.

27:40.223 --> 27:43.792
So there we were, shredding some
gin rummy with our dawg Rose,

27:43.836 --> 27:46.621
sipping on prune juice,
when we got to thinking,

27:46.665 --> 27:50.103
"How did our perp slip into
our vic's apartment on the DL?"

27:50.146 --> 27:52.975
And then it hit us,
the cams spec the ground,

27:53.019 --> 27:54.455
but there's no eyes on the roof,

27:54.498 --> 27:57.066
so we came up here
to investigate, and check it.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.285
Exhibit A.

27:58.328 --> 27:59.547
Fresh scrapes
on the edge,

27:59.590 --> 28:01.244
along with some flakes
of orange paint.

28:01.288 --> 28:05.118
And where, pray tell, did
the paint à l'orange come from?

28:05.161 --> 28:07.207
Behold, Exhibit B.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.948
QUINN:
A ladder.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.776
An orange ladder

28:10.819 --> 28:12.952
and fully extendable,
long enough to make

28:12.995 --> 28:15.302
a bridge.

28:16.651 --> 28:18.653
TANI:
Wow, slamming
that thing down

28:18.697 --> 28:20.655
from one roof to another
would explain the noise

28:20.699 --> 28:21.830
that Todd heard
when he got back.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.571
Makes sense.Do you know what this means?

28:23.614 --> 28:25.225
Unfortunately.I think this means that

28:25.268 --> 28:28.750
our boys just figured out how
our killer dodged the cameras.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.404
Yeah.

28:30.447 --> 28:31.927
TANI: Them.[both grunt]

28:31.971 --> 28:34.582
Look, I know what
you guys are thinking,

28:34.625 --> 28:35.888
but before you
start thanking us

28:35.931 --> 28:38.107
for cracking this
case wide open,

28:38.151 --> 28:40.544
let us first
thank you.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.372
Because it turns out
being a cop isn't just

28:42.416 --> 28:44.592
about beating up bad guys
and driving real fast,

28:44.635 --> 28:46.942
it's also about
personal growth.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.944
You can really learn
a lot about yourself.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.555
Just like we learned
to believe in ourselves

28:51.599 --> 28:53.775
and trust our "insties,"
which, as I mentioned earlier,

28:53.819 --> 28:56.386
is totally
how we just

28:56.430 --> 28:58.214
cracked open
this case.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.702
Instincts, huh?
Is that what it was?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.748
Or was it that
your stoke levels

29:09.791 --> 29:12.620
were getting low, so you
came up here to get blazed?

29:12.663 --> 29:15.101
But you didn't realize that the
door was gonna lock behind you,

29:15.144 --> 29:17.581
so as you were trying
to figure out how to get down,

29:17.625 --> 29:18.757
you noticed the scrape marks,

29:18.800 --> 29:20.149
saw the ladder
on the other roof,

29:20.193 --> 29:22.369
and then you somehow managed
to put it together.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.632
Is that what you meant
by, by "insties"?

29:25.807 --> 29:27.983
Wow, you're good.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.029
[chuckles]
You just solved
the mystery

29:30.072 --> 29:32.248
of us solving the mystery.

29:32.292 --> 29:35.251
SCOOTER:
Yeah, that's meta crime
fighting right there.

29:35.295 --> 29:37.079
Just when she was
starting to like you.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.385
Total bums.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.386
QUINN:
All right,

29:39.429 --> 29:42.345
despite the circumstances,

29:42.389 --> 29:43.825
it still counts.

29:43.869 --> 29:47.350
I am actually impressed.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.268
What's happening
to your face?

29:52.312 --> 29:53.879
Are you about to cry?
Is he crying?

29:53.922 --> 29:55.837
I'm sorry.Are you crying?

29:55.881 --> 29:57.404
I'm just feeling
super emotional right now.

29:57.447 --> 29:58.971
Me, too.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.886
Come on, my dude.

30:02.931 --> 30:03.845
Give it up.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.368
Does he expect me to hug him?

30:05.412 --> 30:07.196
Just go for it.SCOOTER:
That's right.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.242
Bring it in.QUINN: Oh.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.461
No drug like a hug.

30:15.335 --> 30:18.381
TANI:
Wow, yeah, that
really warms my heart.

30:26.128 --> 30:29.566
Why would I steal code
from Tropovision?

30:29.610 --> 30:31.481
I work for them.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.875
That makes no sense.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.356
Sensible or not, your login
and password were used

30:36.399 --> 30:37.879
to steal that software, Julia.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.012
JUNIOR:
You know what I think?
I think you're a legit

30:40.055 --> 30:43.363
tech genius who came up with
this amazing program, except

30:43.406 --> 30:45.147
this company's gonna take
all your profits.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.540
ADAM:
Yeah, meanwhile,
your student loans

30:46.583 --> 30:48.237
are still
sitting there unpaid.

30:48.281 --> 30:49.891
So, being the innovator you are,

30:49.935 --> 30:52.546
you figured you'd innovate your
way into a little side hustle.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.983
Mm-hmm.
You know, we get it.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.767
Come on, if I'm
such a genius,

30:56.811 --> 30:58.378
then why would I be
stupid enough

30:58.421 --> 30:59.770
to use my own login?[lock buzzes]

30:59.814 --> 31:01.816
[clears throat]

31:07.822 --> 31:09.911
Cyber decrypted the I.P. address

31:09.955 --> 31:11.957
used to download
that stolen code.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.827
She's telling
the truth, man.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.482
It wasn't her. Take a look.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.144
Any idea who this is?

31:27.146 --> 31:29.104
JUNIOR:
All right, come on,
Julia, seems like

31:29.148 --> 31:31.628
you've been telling the truth
so far. Why start lying now?

31:37.330 --> 31:38.984
That's my father.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.642
His name's
Micah Wahea.

31:45.686 --> 31:50.125
12 years ago,
I tried to help him get clean...

31:50.169 --> 31:51.953
but he was too far gone.

31:53.259 --> 31:56.349
He disappeared...
and I moved on.

31:57.350 --> 32:00.396
A few months back, he turns up,

32:00.440 --> 32:02.442
clean and sober.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.924
Wanting to make up
for all the lost years.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.232
I said okay.

32:11.538 --> 32:14.019
Guess I'm not so smart
after all.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.020
GROVER:
Hey,

32:15.063 --> 32:18.153
Julia... that's your father.

32:18.197 --> 32:19.154
You love your father.

32:19.198 --> 32:21.156
Of course you want
to believe him.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.679
It's just that, um,

32:22.723 --> 32:24.681
sometimes what we want
to believe

32:24.725 --> 32:26.553
doesn't quite line up
with what's true.

32:26.596 --> 32:30.731
ADAM:
Julia, if your dad
has relapsed,

32:30.774 --> 32:32.037
then helping us find him

32:32.080 --> 32:34.039
would be the best thing
you could do for him.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.006
Door.

32:49.576 --> 32:52.405
Micah Wahea. Five-O.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.932
Clear. No sign of Micah.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.542
And by the looks of things,

32:59.586 --> 33:00.804
he didn't leave
willingly.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.284
Yeah, we got a
busted-in doorjamb,

33:02.328 --> 33:03.590
overturned furniture.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.813
And fresh blood.

33:11.076 --> 33:14.079
Seems we're not the only ones
looking for Julia's father.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.440
Hey.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.050
So a BOLO's out
on Micah.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.095
I just spoke
to the neighbors,

33:30.138 --> 33:31.183
and they said
they heard shouting

33:31.226 --> 33:32.880
coming from here
less than an hour ago,

33:32.923 --> 33:34.012
so this just happened.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.404
Check this out. At
least a dozen photos

33:35.448 --> 33:36.797
of his daughter.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.799
And I found a schedule
for a drug recovery group

33:38.842 --> 33:40.192
on his fridge.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.237
I mean, he seems like
a proud, sober dad to me,

33:42.281 --> 33:43.717
not a user taking
advantage of his kid.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.762
Maybe Julia
had it wrong.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.329
Well, except he did
steal the code

33:47.373 --> 33:48.722
for the self-driving cars.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.767
Yeah, well, I'm thinking
whoever these dealers are,

33:50.811 --> 33:51.899
they strong-armed
him into it.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.466
[phone ringing]

33:53.509 --> 33:55.337
Lou, what's up?GROVER: Well, Julia has hacked

33:55.381 --> 33:57.122
directly into the CPU

33:57.165 --> 33:58.558
of one of
the drug cars,

33:58.601 --> 33:59.950
thanks to some short cuts.

33:59.994 --> 34:01.039
Guess it helps

34:01.082 --> 34:02.649
when you write the code.
Listen, man,

34:02.692 --> 34:03.911
these drug dealers got

34:03.954 --> 34:05.304
a warehouse
full of these puppies.

34:05.347 --> 34:08.220
GPS gave us the location,
and Steve's on his way.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.483
Okay, send us the address,
we'll meet them there.

34:10.526 --> 34:11.571
Will do, hang on.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.660
[doors bang open]

34:13.703 --> 34:15.053
[grunting]

34:20.971 --> 34:22.364
I'm in.

34:23.757 --> 34:27.239
Oh, my God.
They have my dad.

34:27.282 --> 34:28.718
AKAMU:
Cops are on to us now,

34:28.762 --> 34:30.329
so I'm only going
to ask you once.

34:30.372 --> 34:32.679
Who did you talk to?

34:32.722 --> 34:34.072
[grunting]

34:37.118 --> 34:38.902
We have to do something.Be right back.

34:38.946 --> 34:39.947
[Micah grunts]

34:42.210 --> 34:44.343
Steve, they got her old man
in there, man,

34:44.386 --> 34:46.084
and they've been working him
over pretty good.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.389
You got to hurry.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.394
[grunting]

34:52.438 --> 34:54.309
AKAMU:
Don't want to talk, huh?

34:54.353 --> 34:55.310
No, no.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.746
[cocks gun]Okay.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.096
You know what that means.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.750
MICAH: Please, no.[engine starts]

35:00.794 --> 35:01.969
No.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.710
AKAMU: What the hell?[tires screeching]

35:11.457 --> 35:12.632
MAN:
Who's controlling it?

35:14.242 --> 35:16.244
MAN 2:
Disable the damn thing!

35:16.288 --> 35:17.811
[bullets hitting car]

35:17.854 --> 35:19.334
MAN 2:
We got to shoot out the motor!

35:22.337 --> 35:25.123
[screams]

35:31.955 --> 35:33.131
[grunting]

35:49.669 --> 35:51.410
MAN 1:
I think we got it.

35:52.454 --> 35:53.586
JULIA:
The car's dead.

35:53.629 --> 35:54.674
MAN 1:
Careful, it could
start up again.

35:54.717 --> 35:57.503
[shouts]

36:18.785 --> 36:20.787
[groaning]

36:22.354 --> 36:24.051
Hey, buddy, you okay?

36:24.094 --> 36:25.095
Mm-hmm.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.187
JUNIOR:
Clear.

36:35.193 --> 36:40.023
Well done. Well done,
kiddo. Well done.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.243
This is ridiculous. I wasn't
even on the roof last night.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.463
You were careful,
I'll give you that.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.987
CSU did not find any prints
on the ladder.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.555
That's because I didn't use
any ladder.

36:49.598 --> 36:50.991
So what am I doing here?

36:51.034 --> 36:54.212
Are you familiar with
how Wi-Fi works, Mr. Garis?

36:54.255 --> 36:56.301
Of course.
Good. Okay.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.650
So you know
that every network

36:57.693 --> 36:59.434
has a very specific
digital signature.

36:59.478 --> 37:02.481
Which means that it's possible
for us to figure out

37:02.524 --> 37:04.439
who logs on at any given time.

37:04.483 --> 37:05.832
Do you see where
I'm going with this?

37:05.875 --> 37:08.704
At 12:03 a.m. last night,
your cell phone connected

37:08.748 --> 37:09.966
to the Wi-Fi
of the building

37:10.010 --> 37:13.056
next door, which
your company also manages.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.493
Then, around
15 minutes later,

37:14.536 --> 37:16.712
it connected to the Wi-Fi
of Marion's building.

37:16.756 --> 37:19.715
At 12:48 a.m.,
that same sequence

37:19.759 --> 37:21.761
of connect and disconnect
happens again,

37:21.804 --> 37:23.153
only this time in reverse.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.068
See, that seems like enough time
for you to shuttle

37:25.112 --> 37:26.940
back and forth
across your ladder bridge,

37:26.983 --> 37:29.116
with a quick pit stop
to kill Marion.

37:32.162 --> 37:33.294
I want a lawyer.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.035
That's smart.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.559
And they're probably gonna tell
you that our Wi-Fi evidence

37:37.603 --> 37:39.387
is circumstantial,
and they'll be right.

37:40.432 --> 37:42.434
But here's
your problem:

37:42.477 --> 37:44.305
we have you
on motive, too.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.916
Mmm. We went through
Marion's e-mail.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.397
We know that she
accused you of

37:49.441 --> 37:50.877
embezzling money
from the building.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.748
You know, when you billed
the owner for repair work

37:52.792 --> 37:54.315
that you never
performed.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.709
Yeah, she's a crazy old lady
who accused a lot of people

37:56.752 --> 37:59.581
of things they didn't do.Except in this case,
she was right.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.757
We went through your
financials, Brent.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.977
There seem to be
several large deposits

38:04.020 --> 38:06.109
that coincide with work
that you billed your boss for

38:06.153 --> 38:07.807
but never completed.

38:07.850 --> 38:11.811
You know, it's really a shame
you can't keep that money.

38:11.854 --> 38:13.116
Could've used it for the lawyer.

38:21.255 --> 38:22.474
SCOOTER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:22.517 --> 38:25.607
two legends of
law enforcement, T-Bone

38:25.651 --> 38:27.522
and Q-Money!

38:27.566 --> 38:29.481
[air horn sound effect]

38:29.524 --> 38:31.483
SKEEZ:
We watched you at work.

38:31.526 --> 38:33.223
You guys are like artists.

38:33.267 --> 38:34.921
You totes nailed
that douche-nozzle.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.619
Yeah, we, like,
totes harshed his mellow

38:37.663 --> 38:40.796
until he was, uh, mellow-less.Stop talking.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.799
And, lest you forget, none of
this would've been possible

38:43.843 --> 38:46.062
without us.Really? Because

38:46.106 --> 38:47.673
the way that I recall it,
the only contributions

38:47.716 --> 38:49.022
you guys made was

38:49.065 --> 38:50.632
disobeying orders,
getting high,

38:50.676 --> 38:54.332
and... [sighs]

38:55.681 --> 38:57.247
We could not have
done this without you.

39:03.079 --> 39:06.169
You know, I wasn't kidding
about what I said earlier.

39:06.213 --> 39:09.172
This whole experience
has been mad inspiring.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.174
In fact, if my career

39:11.218 --> 39:15.004
as a social media influencer
extraordinaire craps out,

39:15.048 --> 39:18.007
yeah, I may just give
law enforcement a try.

39:18.051 --> 39:19.792
No.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.228
No. Listen.

39:21.271 --> 39:23.317
As much as we would love
to have you,

39:23.361 --> 39:25.014
um, you-you

39:25.058 --> 39:26.189
have a gift.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.453
Yes. Yes.

39:28.496 --> 39:32.326
And you guys contribute
a, a tiny amount

39:32.370 --> 39:34.023
of joy to people...So small.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.024
...every day.
And-and

39:35.068 --> 39:36.374
who are we to deny
the world that?

39:36.417 --> 39:37.505
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

39:38.550 --> 39:39.594
So true.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.727
I guess we all serve
in our own way.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.382
Plus, there's
the drug testing.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.862
Right.
SKEEZ:
Hey.

39:46.906 --> 39:50.910
Before we go, would you guys
do us the honor of a selfie?

39:50.953 --> 39:53.260
Oh. no.Of course.

39:53.303 --> 39:55.393
We really
appreciate that.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.570
"Solved" on three.
One, two, three.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.572
ALL:
Solved.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.451
[indistinct chatter]

40:19.199 --> 40:20.635
Dad.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.900
So, uh, how's dear old Dad?

40:24.944 --> 40:26.902
He's gonna be fine.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.730
GROVER:
Did he say how he
happened to get

40:28.774 --> 40:31.080
mixed up in all of this?Yeah, he did.

40:31.124 --> 40:33.561
Uh, Micah came out here
about six months ago.

40:33.605 --> 40:35.084
Wanted to reconnect with Julia,

40:35.128 --> 40:36.738
and he made the mistake
of bragging

40:36.782 --> 40:39.437
to some of his old buddies
about what a success

40:39.480 --> 40:42.570
his daughter had become.And being the unscrupulous
drug dealers that they are,

40:42.614 --> 40:43.789
they saw an opportunity.

40:43.832 --> 40:45.486
Yeah, they told Micah
he had to get in there

40:45.530 --> 40:46.922
and steal that tech,
or they were gonna

40:46.966 --> 40:48.489
force his daughter
to give it to 'em.

40:48.533 --> 40:49.751
ADAM:
He decided to keep her

40:49.795 --> 40:52.972
out of it, and here we are.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.322
[both crying]

41:09.162 --> 41:11.207
[elevator bell dings]Wow, that is awful

41:11.251 --> 41:14.036
and also kind of hilarious
but mostly awful.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.169
Yeah, I'll-- we'll see
what we can do about it.

41:16.212 --> 41:20.303
Okay. Bye.Awful and hilarious
is my jam. Dish.

41:20.347 --> 41:22.871
That was Kamekona.
Apparently, Scooter and Skeez

41:22.915 --> 41:25.613
tagged the wrong shrimp truck
on their Instagram post.[chuckling]

41:25.657 --> 41:28.050
So their main competitor
is getting all the hype.

41:28.094 --> 41:29.748
Oh, what else did you expect
from the brain trust?

41:29.791 --> 41:32.446
Yeah, they want one of us
to call them and make it right.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.187
Oh, no, that's
all you.Really?

41:34.230 --> 41:35.797
Yeah.Are you kidding?

41:35.841 --> 41:37.320
I saw the way you hugged Skeez.

41:37.364 --> 41:38.713
I mean, you guys
are practically dating.

41:38.757 --> 41:39.758
But...

41:39.801 --> 41:42.238
[stammering]

41:42.282 --> 41:43.544
[others chatting indistinctly]

41:43.588 --> 41:45.372
Oh, hey, guys.Oh, hey.
What's up?

41:45.415 --> 41:46.504
STEVE: What's up?This isn't strange.

41:46.547 --> 41:49.071
Why, why are they staring at us?

41:49.115 --> 41:51.987
Reigns, what are you
looking at on your phone?

41:52.031 --> 41:53.032
What are you all
laughing at?

41:53.075 --> 41:54.903
Guys, she said Reigns.

41:54.947 --> 41:56.905
She only says Reigns
when she's really angry.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.907
Should I be?

41:58.951 --> 42:01.301
You might be when you see
what we're looking at.

42:01.344 --> 42:03.346
The recruitment video.

42:03.390 --> 42:05.348
GROVER:
Oh, you damn right it's
the recruitment video,

42:05.392 --> 42:07.525
and it is a masterpiece.

42:07.568 --> 42:09.744
All right, let's see it.JUNIOR: Let's go.

42:09.788 --> 42:11.006
GROVER:
Hell yeah.

42:11.050 --> 42:11.964
TANI:
It's that good? Okay.

42:13.356 --> 42:16.490
As officers of the Honolulu
Police Department,

42:16.534 --> 42:19.449
we get to help people every day
and effect positive change

42:19.493 --> 42:20.668
in our community.

42:20.712 --> 42:22.757
Plus the pay and benefits
is pretty rad.

42:22.801 --> 42:24.106
So if that sounds baller to you,

42:24.150 --> 42:27.283
head over to JoinHonoluluPD.org

42:27.327 --> 42:29.851
to see how you can become
one of Honolulu's finest.

42:29.895 --> 42:31.766
Actually, this is not
as terrible

42:31.810 --> 42:33.463
as I thought
it was gonna be.It's fine.

42:33.507 --> 42:35.378
Now let's get this scumbag
off the street

42:35.422 --> 42:37.380
before he exposes himself
to any more nuns.

42:37.424 --> 42:39.295
Wait, here comes
the best part.

42:41.254 --> 42:44.605
Here you go, Officers.
Five-O can take it from here.

42:44.649 --> 42:45.693
QUINN:
Wait a minute,

42:45.737 --> 42:46.694
is that supposed
to be us?

42:46.738 --> 42:48.348
Thanks, Scooter
and Skeez.

42:48.391 --> 42:51.351
We couldn't have solved
this case without you.

42:51.394 --> 42:52.395
What the hell?

42:52.439 --> 42:54.136
I-I did, I did not
flirt like that.

42:54.180 --> 42:55.573
STEVE:
Hold on, hold on,
this could be

42:55.616 --> 42:57.575
a good thing. What if we get
an influx of millennials

42:57.618 --> 42:58.924
who want to join
the force?

42:58.967 --> 43:00.490
ADAM:
Oh, yeah, an army of
Scooters and Skeezes

43:00.534 --> 43:01.970
patrolling the streets,
keeping the Island safe.

43:02.014 --> 43:04.407
God help us all.
