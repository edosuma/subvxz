(LAUGHING)

00:37.888 --> 00:39.688
It seems I've caught you.

00:39.722 --> 00:40.788
It seems you have.

00:40.822 --> 00:42.622
To the victor, the spoils...

00:44.722 --> 00:46.488
What is it?

00:46.522 --> 00:48.155
I have such feelings for you.

00:48.655 --> 00:49.822
And I for you.

00:49.855 --> 00:52.888
I hear so many stories...

00:52.922 --> 00:56.288
Stories about
my many good deeds
and heroic acts?

00:56.322 --> 01:00.262
Stories of your gambling,
your drinking, your debts...

01:01.128 --> 01:03.328
Your fondness for women.

01:03.362 --> 01:07.561
Lies. Lies spread by small,
cowardly men,

01:07.595 --> 01:09.362
jealous that I have
captured the heart

01:09.395 --> 01:12.628
-of the most beautiful woman
in all of Atlantis.
-(SIGHS)

01:14.128 --> 01:17.195
All I ask is that
you speak the truth.

01:19.395 --> 01:21.828
I have been known to drink,

01:22.628 --> 01:23.628
and gamble.

01:24.995 --> 01:27.428
There were debts,
there were women.

01:28.095 --> 01:30.062
Many of both.

01:30.095 --> 01:31.428
It's all in the past.

01:33.362 --> 01:35.595
All the women I have known,

01:36.762 --> 01:39.262
I have never felt
this way before.

01:41.462 --> 01:44.195
Then, I shall put
these stories from my mind.

01:44.562 --> 01:45.662
(THUMP)

01:47.728 --> 01:48.828
(SHRIEKING)

01:54.695 --> 01:55.828
Kyros.

01:56.928 --> 01:59.228
I was just on my way
to see you.

01:59.262 --> 02:01.668
I had your money,
the entire debt.

02:01.702 --> 02:04.668
Unfortunately, I was attacked
and robbed.

02:04.702 --> 02:06.568
Save your breath, Hercules.

02:06.602 --> 02:08.235
I'll get you your money.
I swear on my life!

02:08.268 --> 02:11.135
Enops is very skilled.
Your death will be swift.

02:11.735 --> 02:12.802
(GASPS)

02:12.835 --> 02:14.902
Kyros. I beg of you.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.968
I have known men to live
a moment

02:17.001 --> 02:20.102
after the head has been
severed from the body.

02:20.135 --> 02:22.668
The, uh, look of confusion
is most amusing.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.535
Please! I'll do anything!

02:25.568 --> 02:29.302
You're full of promises
when a sword hangs
over your neck.

02:30.235 --> 02:32.368
I, I swear to you.
I am a man of my word.

02:33.302 --> 02:34.402
No!

02:38.968 --> 02:43.868
Perhaps there is a way
for you to keep your head
upon your shoulders.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.335
Tell me what it is
you wish for me to do.

02:45.368 --> 02:48.302
I will spare your life
if you perform
a simple errand for me.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.002
I wish for you to retrieve...

02:52.368 --> 02:53.368
A box.

02:54.635 --> 02:56.002
What's inside this box?

02:56.035 --> 02:57.402
That, you do not need to know.

02:57.435 --> 02:59.042
You must deliver it to me
unopened.

03:00.108 --> 03:01.375
Where will I find it?

03:01.408 --> 03:04.042
It is to be found
in Campe's lair in Hades.

03:05.675 --> 03:07.375
Are you insane?

03:07.408 --> 03:09.142
You expect me to journey
to the Underworld?

03:09.175 --> 03:13.208
All of Atlantis has heard you
boast of how
you killed the Earth Bull.

03:13.242 --> 03:16.842
Surely, what I ask
is not beyond
a man of your talents?

03:16.875 --> 03:18.708
I was exaggerating.

03:20.508 --> 03:23.275
To descend to Hades
means certain death.

03:23.308 --> 03:25.342
You might as well kill me now.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.708
As you wish.
But, you will not be
the first to die.

03:31.175 --> 03:33.442
She is not a part of this.
Let her go.

03:33.475 --> 03:36.375
I will let her go
when you place the box I seek
before me.

03:36.408 --> 03:40.475
If you harm her,
I swear to the gods,
I will kill you.

03:40.508 --> 03:42.375
You have until midnight
tomorrow.

03:42.408 --> 03:45.142
Bring the box to
the Square of the Armourers.

03:45.175 --> 03:47.408
If you attempt to rescue
Medusa,

03:47.442 --> 03:50.642
I promise she will suffer
most cruelly before she dies.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.008

03:54.042 --> 03:55.108

04:41.915 --> 04:43.515
(ROOSTER CROWING)

04:43.548 --> 04:46.782
There is more mould
on this bread
than there is bread itself.

04:46.815 --> 04:48.282
If we are to eat
breakfast today,

04:48.315 --> 04:50.215
we'll have to visit
the market.

04:57.615 --> 04:58.955
JASON: Hercules.

05:00.355 --> 05:04.388
A dozen more paces
and he would have actually
made it to his own bed.

05:07.255 --> 05:10.588
-Wake up, you drunken fool!
-(HERCULES WHIMPERING)

05:10.622 --> 05:12.588
I'm ashamed
to call you a friend.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.188
They've taken Medusa.

05:25.855 --> 05:29.188
If I don't deliver the box
by midnight,
Kyros will kill her.

05:29.888 --> 05:31.322
What's inside the box?

05:31.355 --> 05:33.988
Kyros wouldn't say.
He said it's to remain
unopened.

05:34.022 --> 05:36.455
He was very specific
about that.

05:36.488 --> 05:37.888
Where can the box be found?

05:38.388 --> 05:39.422
It's in Hades.

05:40.422 --> 05:42.722
Hades? The Underworld?

05:42.755 --> 05:43.855
The realm of the dead?

05:43.888 --> 05:46.355
That... That's suicide.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.355
We should attempt
to rescue Medusa.

05:48.388 --> 05:50.422
We don't know where
he's holding her.

05:50.455 --> 05:53.155
He said he'd kill her
if any attempt was made.

05:53.188 --> 05:55.322
I mean, how is it even
possible to descend to Hades?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.955
There's the conventional route
which involves dying.

05:59.155 --> 06:01.028
I suggest we find
an alternative.

06:01.062 --> 06:04.128
I've heard stories of people
descending to Hades
and returning.

06:04.162 --> 06:05.895
How? How did they do it?

06:05.928 --> 06:09.528
That is known only to those
versed in the sacred mysteries
of Eleusis.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.128
We must find the hierophant,
Eunapius.

06:16.362 --> 06:18.328
JASON: So, who is this
Eunapius?

06:18.362 --> 06:20.695
He is a servant
of Hades' bride, Persephone.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.495
It's believed that she
revealed the secrets
of the path of Hades

06:23.528 --> 06:25.828
to her most devout followers.

06:25.862 --> 06:28.962
They are sworn to protect
the ritual.

06:28.995 --> 06:30.828
How are we to persuade him
to reveal it to us?

06:30.862 --> 06:33.128
I'll persuade him
by holding a sword
to his throat

06:33.162 --> 06:34.762
and threatening to kill him
if he doesn't.

06:50.528 --> 06:52.228
Are you Eunapius?

06:53.695 --> 06:56.328
If I am not,
you will have had
a wasted journey.

06:57.762 --> 07:01.202
We were told
that you could help us
descend into Hades.

07:01.235 --> 07:03.335
Descending to Hades
is simple enough.

07:04.435 --> 07:06.768
There are many ways to die,

07:06.802 --> 07:08.168
and many people
willing to kill.

07:09.868 --> 07:11.635
We wish to descend
to the Underworld,

07:11.668 --> 07:13.068
then return to the land
of the living.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.735
Ah.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.935
That is more complicated.

07:19.002 --> 07:20.335
I'm afraid I cannot help you.

07:21.935 --> 07:23.702
I do not wish to hurt you,
old man,

07:23.735 --> 07:25.868
but you will tell me
what I need to know.

07:27.668 --> 07:28.935
Look around you.

07:28.968 --> 07:30.935
HERCULES: I've seen the ruins.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.735
Look again.

07:39.668 --> 07:43.002
I thought you said that he was
the only surviving member
of this cult?

07:43.035 --> 07:45.268
Perhaps it's regaining
its popularity.

07:46.435 --> 07:49.668
Much blood has been spilt
in our temples.

07:49.702 --> 07:52.468
Leave, before there is more.

07:52.502 --> 07:56.202
Our friend's life
depends on us
descending into Hades.

07:56.235 --> 07:58.368
We will not leave
until you tell us
what we need to know.

07:59.742 --> 08:01.042
Kill him.

08:06.042 --> 08:07.208
Who are you?

08:07.242 --> 08:09.942
I am a man that would do
anything to save his friend.

08:12.008 --> 08:15.542
I have sworn a sacred oath
to Persephone.

08:15.575 --> 08:17.608
We'll be sure
to tell Persephone
that you kept that oath,

08:17.642 --> 08:19.108
when you joined her in Hades.

08:20.275 --> 08:24.608
You do not realise
the dangers involved.

08:24.642 --> 08:26.275
We're willing to take
our chances.

08:32.375 --> 08:33.542
Very well.

08:33.575 --> 08:36.342
I will reveal to you
the knowledge you seek.

08:44.465 --> 08:47.198
EUNAPIUS: <i>You must first</i>
<i>cleanse your bodies.</i>

08:57.498 --> 09:01.605
<i>You must give a part</i>
<i>of yourself as an offering</i>
<i>to the goddess Persephone.</i>

09:10.238 --> 09:12.205
<i>Drink the kykeon</i>
<i>from the phial.</i>

09:13.038 --> 09:15.005
<i>It will slow your heart,</i>

09:15.038 --> 09:18.271
<i>until only the faintest traces</i>
<i>of life remain.</i>

09:22.305 --> 09:25.338
<i>When you desire to return</i>
<i>to the land of the living,</i>

09:25.371 --> 09:27.571
<i>you must sound the horn.</i>

09:29.005 --> 09:31.105
<i>The one who is to stay</i>
<i>with the bodies</i>

09:31.138 --> 09:33.871
<i>will be unable</i>
<i>to hear the horn.</i>

09:33.905 --> 09:36.338
<i>He will be alerted</i>
<i>by the crows,</i>

09:36.371 --> 09:38.171
<i>the harbingers of death.</i>

09:45.771 --> 09:47.538
<i>When the crows caw,</i>

09:47.571 --> 09:50.371
<i>you will revive your friends</i>
<i>with your blood,</i>

09:50.405 --> 09:54.171
<i>for it is your life's force</i>
<i>flowing into them</i>

09:54.205 --> 09:56.571
<i>that will enable them</i>
<i>to ascend to this world.</i>

09:59.938 --> 10:02.078
<i>As the kykeon takes hold,</i>

10:02.111 --> 10:04.278
<i>you will hear a sound</i>
<i>in your ears...</i>

10:04.311 --> 10:08.045
<i>A pulse and a surging,</i>
<i>bearing you on.</i>

10:08.078 --> 10:13.145
<i>Move with the wave</i>
<i>as it breaks through the wall</i>
<i>before you.</i>

10:13.178 --> 10:19.840
<i>Then allow Persephone</i>
<i>to lead you forth</i>
<i>into Hades.</i>

10:24.145 --> 10:26.545
So this is what it feels like
to be dead?

10:27.745 --> 10:29.611
It's different to
how I thought it would be.

10:30.645 --> 10:33.678
What did you think
it would feel like?

10:33.711 --> 10:36.145
I thought it would be warmer.

10:53.711 --> 10:54.945

I'm going to do my very best
to live as long as possible.

14:55.305 --> 14:57.005
There's something out there.

15:03.011 --> 15:04.111
Who are they?

15:04.145 --> 15:06.545
They're here to greet
their friends or relatives

15:06.578 --> 15:08.678
who have crossed over
into Hades.

15:08.711 --> 15:10.111
What do they want with us?

15:10.145 --> 15:11.911
Perhaps, they're just
being friendly?

It doesn't feel very friendly.

(SHAKILY) No.

We're not actually dead...

15:40.811 --> 15:42.811
Well, as in dead, dead.

15:42.845 --> 15:44.111
How is that possible?

(SIGHS) It's complicated.
And we don't have much time...

15:46.511 --> 15:47.978
We are here to retrieve a box.

15:50.611 --> 15:52.278
-What is in this box?
-We don't know.

15:52.311 --> 15:55.711
All we know is it's to be
found in Campe's lair
in Tartarus.

15:55.745 --> 15:57.645
You journey to Tartarus?

15:57.678 --> 15:59.345
We have no choice.

15:59.378 --> 16:01.011
Then, I will act
as your guide.

16:01.045 --> 16:02.585
We cannot ask that of you.

16:02.618 --> 16:03.918

16:03.951 --> 16:05.818
you gave us hope

to repay that debt.

40:03.420 --> 40:05.020
Where will you go?
How will I find you?

40:05.054 --> 40:06.354
You won't.

40:06.387 --> 40:08.760
I don't want you
to search for me.

40:08.794 --> 40:11.994
You can never
look on me again.
You must think that I am dead.

40:13.094 --> 40:14.394
I will not do it.

40:14.427 --> 40:15.894
This is all my doing.

40:15.927 --> 40:18.060
I will not rest
until I find a way
to lift this curse.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.860
(GUARDS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

40:22.694 --> 40:23.860
Medusa?

40:26.194 --> 40:27.527
Medusa!

40:34.927 --> 40:36.494
JASON: <i>I have seen the evil</i>
<i>that it can do.</i>

40:38.960 --> 40:41.894
You must keep it somewhere
that no-one can ever open it.

40:41.927 --> 40:43.594
It will be done.

40:44.794 --> 40:46.494
Did you know?

40:46.527 --> 40:48.760
Did you know
that this was going to happen?

40:48.794 --> 40:52.360
We both knew what would
become of Medusa.

40:52.394 --> 40:54.894
I did not know how,
or when it would happen.

40:54.927 --> 40:56.660
-How can the curse be lifted?
-It cannot.

40:56.694 --> 40:58.360
No. There must be a way!

40:59.194 --> 41:01.294
You were warned

41:01.327 --> 41:03.594
that the box was
a source of great evil.

41:04.194 --> 41:05.494
This is Medusa's fate.

41:05.527 --> 41:07.667
But, Medusa
hasn't done anything
to deserve such a fate.

41:07.700 --> 41:10.134
Her fate is no more deserved
than yours or mine.

41:10.167 --> 41:13.934
She cannot escape her destiny,
just as you
cannot escape yours,

41:13.967 --> 41:16.434
but, one must happen
to serve the other.

41:17.434 --> 41:19.534
Wait... What do you mean?

41:22.800 --> 41:26.300
There are some things
it's better that
you do not know.

41:29.034 --> 41:30.400
Tell me.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.300
There...

41:33.134 --> 41:34.300
Will...

41:35.100 --> 41:36.267
Come a time...

41:37.700 --> 41:38.700
When...

41:40.734 --> 41:43.634
You will have no choice,
but to kill Medusa.

41:47.167 --> 41:48.367
No.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.500
I will never do that.

41:50.534 --> 41:52.267
If you do not,
thousands will die

41:52.300 --> 41:53.867
and Atlantis
will be destroyed.

41:59.334 --> 42:01.467
Well, then, if that is
what it takes

42:01.500 --> 42:04.100
for me to break free
of this fate

42:04.134 --> 42:06.267
that has been decided for me,

42:06.300 --> 42:07.407
then so be it.

42:08.207 --> 42:10.940
Curse you, and curse the gods.

42:24.874 --> 42:26.307
Do your worst.

42:32.007 --> 42:33.540
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

42:46.074 --> 42:47.874
KYROS: <i>When all seems lost...</i>

42:49.340 --> 42:51.440
Hope still remains.

42:51.474 --> 42:53.407
There is a way to kill Medusa.

42:55.674 --> 42:56.674
(GRUNTING)

42:58.507 --> 42:59.507
(GROANING)

43:01.207 --> 43:02.440
No, no, no!
