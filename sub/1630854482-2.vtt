00:01.430 --> 00:04.134
<i>Previously on
"Criminal Minds: Evolution"...</i>

00:04.134 --> 00:05.498
Agent Lewis
uncovered a mass grave.

00:05.498 --> 00:07.170
She'll be staying
in Washington State.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.435
I'm gonna need some help.

00:08.435 --> 00:10.107
Tara Lewis.

00:10.107 --> 00:11.306
Looks like there's been

00:11.306 --> 00:12.736
an active killer
up here for decades.

00:12.736 --> 00:15.178
We got 16 dead bodies
in a buried shipping container.

00:15.178 --> 00:17.543
When's the last time
David Rossi was in the office?

00:17.543 --> 00:18.742
People are saying
this past year,

00:18.742 --> 00:20.513
Agent Rossi's been obsessed.

00:20.513 --> 00:22.713
All those years working in
the basement caught up with him.

00:22.713 --> 00:23.879
What're you working on?

00:23.879 --> 00:26.519
Westbrook family
in Alexandria.

00:26.519 --> 00:28.323
This isn't about invasion.

00:28.323 --> 00:30.787
It's about destruction
of a family.

00:32.657 --> 00:35.231
Chrissy Delaney was targeted
on "SOAR."

00:35.231 --> 00:37.332
That's impossible.
- Luke, "SOAR" is unhackable.

00:37.332 --> 00:38.663
I know.
- I'm the one that secured it.

00:38.663 --> 00:41.798
It's sophisticated
for a 19-year-old kid.

00:41.798 --> 00:44.141
What are the chances
we have identical foot lockers

00:44.141 --> 00:45.307
on opposite coasts?

00:45.307 --> 00:47.738
We need all eyes on this.

01:04.887 --> 01:06.526
What...

01:06.526 --> 01:07.791
What is...

01:11.632 --> 01:13.236
I don't feel so good.

01:17.636 --> 01:20.870
One, two, three.

02:03.814 --> 02:05.486
What's--
What's going on?

02:07.785 --> 02:09.754
What--

02:09.754 --> 02:11.921
What are you--

02:11.921 --> 02:14.924
Can you feel that?

02:14.924 --> 02:16.530
No.
- Good.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.269
No, man, I c--
I can't feel anything.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.469
Wh--

02:21.469 --> 02:23.801
Wait, wait, wait, no!
P-P-Please stop!

02:23.801 --> 02:25.605
Stop!
What are you doing to me?
Shh! Shh!

02:25.605 --> 02:27.640
What are you doing?

02:27.640 --> 02:31.677
Shh! I want you to listen
very carefully.

02:36.321 --> 02:38.618
Because you have
a choice to make.

02:44.855 --> 02:46.626

confirmed that Kaylen
is our 13-year-old's friend

03:55.728 --> 03:59.028
but not friend-friend.

03:59.028 --> 04:00.766
Boom.
I rule.

04:00.766 --> 04:02.768
What else you got for me,
LaMontagne, huh?

04:02.768 --> 04:04.605
Bring it.
Well, how's your appetite?

04:04.605 --> 04:07.069
'Cause I got us a table at
that new Italian place tonight.

04:07.069 --> 04:08.642
Ooh, Italiano.

04:08.642 --> 04:09.973
Yeah.

04:09.973 --> 04:11.579
Tonight.

04:11.579 --> 04:14.516
Yeah,
tonight's date night.

04:14.516 --> 04:19.081
Uh, another body
turned up this morning.

04:19.081 --> 04:21.017
Rock Creek Park.

04:21.017 --> 04:22.051
Alright.

04:22.051 --> 04:24.493
It's alright.

04:24.493 --> 04:27.397
Uh, hey, hang on.

04:27.397 --> 04:30.862
Might be able to shuffle
some things... around.

04:30.862 --> 04:33.062
No, don't do that.

04:33.062 --> 04:35.999
But can you, uh,
confirm something for me?

04:35.999 --> 04:38.606
So I can tell myself
I'm not going crazy?

04:40.445 --> 04:43.105
You've had a lot on your
shoulders since we got back.

04:43.105 --> 04:45.481
Like, a lot.

04:45.481 --> 04:48.715
And I know you're supermom
and the boys aren't suffering.

04:50.719 --> 04:52.488
But, um...

04:54.184 --> 04:58.626
Um, you're talking
about us?

04:58.626 --> 05:00.089
Yeah.

05:00.089 --> 05:01.893
Kinda.

05:04.601 --> 05:07.569
Okay, just--

05:07.569 --> 05:09.934
just give me--
give me a chance.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.673
Alright?
To make it up to you.

05:12.673 --> 05:14.708
I will.

05:14.708 --> 05:17.106
I swear.

05:17.106 --> 05:18.877
Okay.
- Okay.

05:18.877 --> 05:20.549
Have a good day.

05:32.057 --> 05:34.728
Morning.
How was your night?

05:34.728 --> 05:36.466
Fine.
How was yours?

05:36.466 --> 05:37.830
Good.

05:37.830 --> 05:42.439
You, uh, still living
out of that hotel, Dave?

05:42.439 --> 05:45.673
What's the case?

05:45.673 --> 05:47.873
This one
is in our backyard.

05:47.873 --> 05:50.843
Four days ago,
Alex Arnold was dumped

05:50.843 --> 05:53.549
at a rest stop
outside of Silver Spring.

05:53.549 --> 05:56.079
Cause of death
was a severed spinal cord.

05:56.079 --> 05:59.852
Last night, it went serial
with Steve Duncan.

05:59.852 --> 06:02.954
Same COD,
severed spinal cord.

06:02.954 --> 06:04.956
Good-looking men
in their 30s,

06:04.956 --> 06:07.189
not a victimology
we see a lot of.

06:07.189 --> 06:09.158
They're usually
the UnSubs.

06:09.158 --> 06:12.865
Well, these two were targeted
for a very specific reason.

06:12.865 --> 06:16.869
They both had apps
like Tinder, Feeld,

06:16.869 --> 06:18.970
Adult Friend Finder
on their phone.

06:18.970 --> 06:22.138
That is where they advertise
their services as bulls.

06:22.138 --> 06:24.679
Are bulls the same thing
as studs?

06:24.679 --> 06:25.878
Close.

06:25.878 --> 06:28.243
In the kink
known as cuckolding,

06:28.243 --> 06:30.784
wives cheat on
their husbands with bulls.

06:30.784 --> 06:32.214
Men like this.

06:32.214 --> 06:34.722
No money trades hands.

06:34.722 --> 06:37.758
It's all legal
and consensual.

06:37.758 --> 06:39.661
The UnSub could have been
burned by that.

06:39.661 --> 06:41.498
Now he's taking
his revenge.

06:41.498 --> 06:43.995
There is another reason
why we have to take this case.

06:43.995 --> 06:46.767
Our last UnSub,
Rory Gilcrest,

06:46.767 --> 06:49.770
he switched cars
at a Wal-Mart parking lot.

06:49.770 --> 06:53.004
This UnSub did the same thing.
Down to the Wal-Mart.

06:53.004 --> 06:55.512
We profiled that Rory
had a partner.

06:55.512 --> 06:56.843
But, I mean...

06:56.843 --> 06:58.680
Is this our
shipping container guy?

06:58.680 --> 07:00.011
I checked with Tara.

07:00.011 --> 07:02.145
None of the bodies
in the shipping container

07:02.145 --> 07:04.653
have severed
spinal cords.

07:04.653 --> 07:07.117
Yes, this is
a very specific signature,

07:07.117 --> 07:10.890
but we can't ignore
what's in front of us.

07:10.890 --> 07:13.794
Details from our last case
are showing up here.

07:13.794 --> 07:16.632
Then there's another theory
we have to consider.

07:16.632 --> 07:18.601
Who's ever behind
the shipping container

07:18.601 --> 07:20.801
doesn't have
one partner.

07:20.801 --> 07:22.066
He has two.

07:24.004 --> 07:27.104
So, the plan here
is standard operating procedure.

07:27.104 --> 07:28.743
We are processing
the photographs,

07:28.743 --> 07:31.009
but our main focus
is a complete DNA breakdown.

07:31.009 --> 07:32.780
Once the samples
are crossed and typed,

07:32.780 --> 07:36.586
we can ID bodies and then,
fingers crossed, our UnSub.

07:36.586 --> 07:39.556
Locard's Exchange Principle
says that a perpetrator

07:39.556 --> 07:42.185
takes and leaves something
at every crime scene.

07:42.185 --> 07:44.957
If this guy revisited this
for 17 years,

07:44.957 --> 07:47.124
there's gonna be
- some piece of him in there.

07:47.124 --> 07:49.566
Prentiss?
What did you do?

07:49.566 --> 07:52.998
Director Bailey, sir, I had to
move this from Washington State.

07:52.998 --> 07:55.330
The locals didn't have
the resources necessary

07:55.330 --> 07:56.738
to investigate it fully.

07:56.738 --> 07:58.135
And I get it.
I love it.

07:58.135 --> 07:59.873
I love the enthusiasm.

07:59.873 --> 08:02.975
But the brass is not
gonna like this.

08:02.975 --> 08:05.241
The body count's
already gone up to 24,

08:05.241 --> 08:06.748
not counting the bones.

08:06.748 --> 08:08.211
I-I want
to be clear here.

08:08.211 --> 08:13.216
The brass doesn't want the BAU
solving this case?

08:13.216 --> 08:14.657
It's not that simple.

08:16.386 --> 08:18.826
Let me run it
up the flagpole.

08:18.826 --> 08:20.762
Just hope
it's worth it.

08:20.762 --> 08:23.864
Get me Director McNamara
in Resource Management.

08:26.099 --> 08:28.671
Man.
- You deal with that every day?

08:28.671 --> 08:30.805
Every day.

08:30.805 --> 08:33.643
As if this job
wasn't hard enough.

09:29.734 --> 09:33.868
UnSub: <i>I want you to listen
very carefully.</i>

09:33.868 --> 09:37.036
<i>Because you have
a choice to make.</i>

09:37.036 --> 09:39.203
<i>I'm going to cut
your spinal cord.</i>

09:39.203 --> 09:41.678
<i>Oh, God.</i>

09:41.678 --> 09:45.880
<i>You can either live
as a quadriplegic.</i>

09:45.880 --> 09:49.444
<i>Control nothing
from the neck down.</i>

09:49.444 --> 09:52.381
<i>Or I kill you.</i>

09:52.381 --> 09:55.120
<i>So what's your choice?</i>

09:58.191 --> 09:59.729
<i>Kill me.</i>

11:24.011 --> 11:26.343
<i>It is claimed
that Oscar Wilde wrote,</i>

11:26.343 --> 11:30.149
<i>"Everything in the world
is about sex, except sex.</i>

11:30.149 --> 11:33.086
<i>Sex is about power."</i>

11:33.086 --> 11:34.516
<i>Except he didn't.</i>

11:34.516 --> 11:37.222
<i>Nobody knows who wrote it.</i>

11:37.222 --> 11:40.830
So I combed through
our two victims' cellphones.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.326
And, uh, these bulls,

11:42.326 --> 11:45.527
they made a large number
of women very, very happy.

11:45.527 --> 11:47.100
What're you, jealous?
- No.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.168
I respect the sanctity
of marriage too much

11:49.168 --> 11:51.368
to mess
with married women.

11:51.368 --> 11:53.810
I was looking for overlap
between the wives.

11:53.810 --> 11:55.570
If the UnSub is
a cuckolded husband,

11:55.570 --> 11:58.441
I figured that's the place
to start, but so far, nothing.

11:58.441 --> 12:00.047
How about a tox screen?

12:00.047 --> 12:02.247
This UnSub said must be
using heavy-duty narcotics.

12:02.247 --> 12:03.545
Still waiting.
But you're right.

12:03.545 --> 12:05.316
If he's performing
back surgery,

12:05.316 --> 12:07.384
it's gonna take a lot more
than a bonk on the head.

12:07.384 --> 12:08.517
Where are we with hotels?

12:08.517 --> 12:09.958
Number one was no help.

12:09.958 --> 12:11.586
But number two
had the receipts.

12:11.586 --> 12:13.929
So Steve Duncan
didn't pay for the room.

12:13.929 --> 12:16.459
His lady friend did,
Julie Sullivan.

12:16.459 --> 12:18.131
Why does she
look familiar?

12:18.131 --> 12:20.166
That's 'cause she's married
to this guy.

12:20.166 --> 12:24.071
Jack Sullivan, City Councilman
for the District of Columbia.

12:24.071 --> 12:25.270
Bring them both in.

12:25.270 --> 12:26.876
The councilman
will stonewall us,

12:26.876 --> 12:29.175
but we might be able
to get something from the wife.

12:29.175 --> 12:31.375
It'd be nice if we could
get some background intel

12:31.375 --> 12:33.542
on the both of them,
but without Penelope--

12:33.542 --> 12:35.115
We don't have time.

12:35.115 --> 12:37.414
Guys, I know
the BAU is different.

12:37.414 --> 12:39.515
I miss Reid.
I miss Simmons.

12:39.515 --> 12:41.418
And we all miss Penelope.

12:43.125 --> 12:46.192
But we're gonna have to
solve this case without them.

12:46.192 --> 12:47.897
Okay, pals,
you're all wonderful,

12:47.897 --> 12:50.064
but these little boxes
are making my brain wobbly.

12:50.064 --> 12:51.362
And I'm sure
it's not just me.

12:51.362 --> 12:53.265
So let's pick this up tomorrow, okay?

12:53.265 --> 12:56.202
<i>Penelope,
I'm still getting a 503</i>

12:56.202 --> 12:58.303
<i>when I use
the automated interface.</i>

12:58.303 --> 13:00.437
Oh, Riley, I feel your pain.

13:00.437 --> 13:01.878
I'll tell you what,

13:01.878 --> 13:03.946
I will e-mail you
my diagnostic checklist.

13:03.946 --> 13:05.343
Still no bueno, give me a call.
Okay?

13:05.343 --> 13:06.509
Except not between
12:00 and 1:00

13:06.509 --> 13:07.917
because that is my picnic time.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.116
Alright?
Bye!

13:09.116 --> 13:10.414
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

13:21.493 --> 13:22.965
Who is this?

13:34.977 --> 13:37.045
Who are you, please?

13:56.658 --> 13:58.066
Oh.

14:05.634 --> 14:07.977
Look, I cannot help you.

14:07.977 --> 14:12.443
What you're asking me about,
it will destroy my career.

14:12.443 --> 14:15.116
Then help yourself out, Councilman.

14:15.116 --> 14:16.447
Let's start here.

14:16.447 --> 14:18.152
You tell me where you were
last night.

14:18.152 --> 14:19.549
And if we can back up
your story,

14:19.549 --> 14:23.124
then your private life
stays private.

14:23.124 --> 14:25.962
I was at home waiting.

14:25.962 --> 14:27.029
For Julie?

14:27.029 --> 14:29.031
Jack waits for me.

14:29.031 --> 14:33.530
And when I'm with,
you know, other men,

14:33.530 --> 14:37.600
I-I send him videos.

14:37.600 --> 14:43.078
Doesn't your husband get jealous
when you do this?

14:43.078 --> 14:44.475
Angry?

14:44.475 --> 14:46.114
No.

14:46.114 --> 14:47.610
It was my idea.

14:47.610 --> 14:50.712
I didn't think she would
like it, but, uh...

14:50.712 --> 14:52.989
I do.

14:52.989 --> 14:54.320
Because when he
comes home,

14:54.320 --> 14:57.719
it's like he has to
win me over again.

14:57.719 --> 14:59.226
It's none of my business, okay?

14:59.226 --> 15:00.590
I'm not here
to kink-shame you.

15:00.590 --> 15:02.064
But I've got to be honest.

15:02.064 --> 15:04.363
A lot of men have killed
over less.

15:04.363 --> 15:05.694
That's not me.

15:05.694 --> 15:07.267
I'm not a killer.

15:07.267 --> 15:08.763
Can you prove it?

15:15.077 --> 15:18.311
There's one last video
Jack got.

15:20.249 --> 15:22.546
I'll have him
show it to you.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.416
Is it of you and Steve?

15:24.416 --> 15:26.220
No.

15:26.220 --> 15:28.651
It was from <i>him.</i>
- The man you're looking for.

15:28.651 --> 15:31.225
I'm sorry. I know we should have
come forward sooner.

15:40.168 --> 15:42.071
The killer
sent you a video?

15:42.071 --> 15:43.600
Wait a minute. Wait, what?
H-How do you know?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.173
Your wife just told me.

15:45.173 --> 15:46.702
We need your phone
right now.

15:46.702 --> 15:48.737
I can't.
I-If anyone finds out--

15:48.737 --> 15:50.640
If you don't,
we'll arrest you

15:50.640 --> 15:52.213
for withholding
material evidence

15:52.213 --> 15:55.150
in a homicide investigation.

15:55.150 --> 15:56.712
You know
what happens then?

15:56.712 --> 15:58.549
Everyone finds out.

16:02.619 --> 16:04.324
You can't be serious.

16:04.324 --> 16:05.787
I'm just the messenger.

16:05.787 --> 16:07.426
But the higher-ups
were very clear.

16:07.426 --> 16:09.758
All costs associated with moving
the shipping container

16:09.758 --> 16:11.760
come out
of the BAU's budget.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.103
Director,
with all due respect,

16:14.103 --> 16:16.204
this team has done
everything you've asked.

16:16.204 --> 16:19.174
We've done more with less,
we've scrimped, we've saved.

16:19.174 --> 16:20.835
And as section chief,

16:20.835 --> 16:22.837
I am allowed
discretionary spending.

16:22.837 --> 16:24.410
I made that point.

16:24.410 --> 16:27.182
They said you don't have
that much discretion.

16:27.182 --> 16:29.085
I'm sorry, Emily.

16:29.085 --> 16:31.384
We can't win against
the bean counters.

16:34.158 --> 16:36.224
What a crock of shit.

16:36.224 --> 16:40.129
It's like we're being punished
for being good at our job.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.691
Do you know
Rebecca Wilson?

16:41.691 --> 16:43.561
At the DOJ?
Yeah. She's a friend.

16:43.561 --> 16:45.662
Want me to have her ask around,
find out what's up?

16:45.662 --> 16:47.466
God, yes, please.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.238
And please tell me we caught
a break with the container.

16:50.238 --> 16:51.767
I wish I could.

16:51.767 --> 16:54.110
We have covered every corner,
swabbed every corpse.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.804
We triple-checked
that foot locker.

16:55.804 --> 16:56.838
Nothing.

16:56.838 --> 16:58.741
Locard can kiss my ass.

16:58.741 --> 17:01.843
Come on.
Nobody's that good.

17:01.843 --> 17:03.416
You want to bet?

17:05.715 --> 17:08.256
He double- and sometimes
triple-reinforced the metal

17:08.256 --> 17:09.587
to prevent leaks.

17:09.587 --> 17:11.688
He wiped down every surface
with bleach

17:11.688 --> 17:13.426
to destroy
third-party DNA.

17:13.426 --> 17:16.891
He wanted this place
as airtight as possible.

17:16.891 --> 17:18.464
Safe, secure.

17:18.464 --> 17:20.334
If the bodies were trophies,
like you thought,

17:20.334 --> 17:22.204
he'd want to preserve them
as long as possible.

17:22.204 --> 17:23.502
You know,
I-I did think that.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.273
But now I think
they were experiments,

17:25.273 --> 17:27.572
because he never repeated
the same pattern.

17:27.572 --> 17:31.576
I mean, he stabbed that guy,
shot her, strangled him.

17:31.576 --> 17:34.150
And then there's
this guy.

17:34.150 --> 17:35.811
What did he do
to this guy?

17:35.811 --> 17:39.551
He poured Sicarius spiders
down this victim's throat.

17:39.551 --> 17:41.454
They're an incredibly
poisonous genus

17:41.454 --> 17:43.324
related to
the brown recluse.

17:43.324 --> 17:44.556
Some of the lab techs
are starting

17:44.556 --> 17:46.591
to call this UnSub that,
"Sicarius."

17:46.591 --> 17:47.922
I hate spiders.

17:47.922 --> 17:51.464
Yeah.

17:51.464 --> 17:53.895
Okay, looks like JJ and Alvez
had a break in their case,

17:53.895 --> 17:57.404
but they need to talk to
the entire team, including you.

17:57.404 --> 18:01.705
UnSub: <i>You can either live
as a quadriplegic.</i>

18:01.705 --> 18:05.280
<i>Control nothing
from the neck down.</i>

18:05.280 --> 18:09.284
<i>Or I kill you.</i>

18:09.284 --> 18:12.683
<i>So what's your choice?</i>

18:17.820 --> 18:20.658
Paralyzation or death.

18:20.658 --> 18:22.891
Giving Steve Duncan
an impossible choice

18:22.891 --> 18:25.300
only heightens
the UnSub's sadism.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.730
Does he reveal his face?

18:26.730 --> 18:29.964
No, but he does reveal
something else

18:29.964 --> 18:32.472
as he's turning
the video off.

18:34.707 --> 18:37.939
Right...

18:37.939 --> 18:39.743
here.

18:39.743 --> 18:42.548
Whoa.
That's another kill kit.

18:42.548 --> 18:45.287
Yeah. We thought these cases
were connected--

18:45.287 --> 18:46.981
the shipping container,
Rory Gilcrest,

18:46.981 --> 18:48.422
our spinal cord guy.

18:48.422 --> 18:51.656
And now we have
our smoking gun.

18:51.656 --> 18:53.460
Hmm.

18:53.460 --> 18:57.464
Dave,
what are you thinking?

18:57.464 --> 18:58.960
All my years
as a profiler,

18:58.960 --> 19:02.469
I studied killers
- under all kinds of pressure.

19:02.469 --> 19:06.000
But I never studied what
a pandemic would do to them.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.409
They couldn't move,
they couldn't hunt.

19:08.409 --> 19:10.774
But that compulsion
would still drive them,

19:10.774 --> 19:14.008
and they would need
some sort of an outlet.

19:14.008 --> 19:16.252
So they started communicating,

19:16.252 --> 19:19.519
helping each other
- to become better predators.

19:19.519 --> 19:21.323
We've got two.

19:21.323 --> 19:23.886
And if we follow the bread
crumbs, we'll find our third.

19:23.886 --> 19:26.493
No, no, no. This is
too organized, too connected.

19:26.493 --> 19:27.923
There's more.

19:27.923 --> 19:29.793
We don't know that
for sure.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.368
Think about what we do
know about him so far.

19:33.368 --> 19:35.502
He's controlled, disciplined.

19:35.502 --> 19:37.273
He knows how to hide.
Right?

19:37.273 --> 19:39.506
He knows if there's no body,
there's no crime.

19:39.506 --> 19:41.376
But he's a hunter, restless.

19:41.376 --> 19:43.510
Always looking
for a better way.

19:43.510 --> 19:47.382
So let's apply that behavior
to his followers.

19:47.382 --> 19:48.845
I see what Rossi's saying.

19:48.845 --> 19:52.013
Why would he be content
with just two?

19:52.013 --> 19:53.784
He isn't
with the killings.

19:53.784 --> 19:58.360
So these aren't
just connected cases.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.955
This is a network.

20:21.682 --> 20:23.814
I don't understand.

20:23.814 --> 20:25.387
Why can't we tell
- Director Bailey what we have?

20:25.387 --> 20:26.949
Because it's not enough.
How can you say that?

20:26.949 --> 20:28.654
This is the biggest case
we've ever had.

20:28.654 --> 20:31.360
O-Okay, so let's just stick
to what we can prove.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.626
We thought the shipping
container ended in 2020

20:33.626 --> 20:35.958
because of the pandemic,
but it didn't.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.730
Instead, the UnSub
gathered followers.

20:38.730 --> 20:40.633
Followers that he's
now activating.

20:40.633 --> 20:42.932
And if that's
what he gets off on,

20:42.932 --> 20:45.506
he might
reactivate himself.

20:45.506 --> 20:49.510
Israel Keyes placed kill kits
across the country,

20:49.510 --> 20:51.413
all for his own use.

20:51.413 --> 20:54.416
Emily, we need more resources.
You know that.

20:54.416 --> 20:57.947
I also know that every time
I try to get those resources,

20:57.947 --> 20:59.355
Bailey screws us.

20:59.355 --> 21:01.720
What we need
is a way around him.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.392
Have any ideas?

21:03.392 --> 21:04.723
No.

21:06.694 --> 21:08.122
But she might.

21:08.122 --> 21:11.532
Prentiss, Rossi, this is
Rebecca Wilson with the DOJ.

21:11.532 --> 21:13.369
Hi, Emily.

21:13.369 --> 21:14.865
Agent Rossi, big fan.

21:14.865 --> 21:18.506
Likewise if you can get some
FBI bureaucrats off our back.

21:18.506 --> 21:21.740
I got the download
on Director Bailey.

21:21.740 --> 21:25.843
He climbed the ladder at DOJ
by being an efficiency expert.

21:25.843 --> 21:29.484
Slashes budgets, reduces staff,
takes the credit when he can,

21:29.484 --> 21:31.651
and passes the buck
everywhere else.

21:31.651 --> 21:33.653
Now that he's Deputy Director
for the Bureau,

21:33.653 --> 21:36.557
he sees a path
to becoming AG.

21:36.557 --> 21:38.790
So the BAU's
a political football.

21:38.790 --> 21:40.121
More like a chess piece.

21:40.121 --> 21:42.629
Explain something to me
like I'm five.

21:42.629 --> 21:44.664
The unit gets results.

21:44.664 --> 21:47.095
Where others see monsters,
we see patterns.

21:47.095 --> 21:51.099
We understand how psychopaths
think and we stop them.

21:51.099 --> 21:53.101
Why fix
what's not broken?

21:53.101 --> 21:54.674
I can ask around.

21:54.674 --> 21:56.478
There's nothing
on the table.

21:56.478 --> 21:58.843
But there could be something
in the works.

21:58.843 --> 22:02.110
There's always something
in the works.

22:02.110 --> 22:03.914
Thanks, Rebecca. Yeah.

22:08.822 --> 22:11.086
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding?

22:11.086 --> 22:13.022
Ow. What?

22:13.022 --> 22:14.991
Y-You and her.

22:14.991 --> 22:16.696
You're so a thing.

22:16.696 --> 22:18.797
No!
W-What?

22:20.504 --> 22:22.768
Oh, God.
Is it that obvious?

22:22.768 --> 22:24.671
I mean, the temperature
in the room went up

22:24.671 --> 22:26.904
like 10 degrees
when you two walked in.

22:26.904 --> 22:30.611
How long has this
been going on?

22:30.611 --> 22:32.877
A couple months.
Cards on the table.

22:32.877 --> 22:34.549
This is not my first time
dating a woman,

22:34.549 --> 22:36.617
but, oh, man,

22:36.617 --> 22:38.212
it is my first time
being this happy.

22:38.212 --> 22:40.621
Oh, that's good.

22:40.621 --> 22:43.855
Oh, we could use some happiness
around here.

22:43.855 --> 22:47.496
Besides, we're gonna give you
so much shit for this.

22:47.496 --> 22:48.662
Ugh.

23:07.276 --> 23:08.781
What is it?

23:08.781 --> 23:11.553
When do I
get to go again?

23:11.553 --> 23:14.754
I told you.
Not yet.

23:14.754 --> 23:16.492
That's not fair.
There's someone I want.

23:16.492 --> 23:18.659
Robert,
are you disobeying me?

23:18.659 --> 23:20.529
<i>No, of course not.</i>

23:21.763 --> 23:23.796
But why are we stopping now?

23:23.796 --> 23:25.897
It's not a stop.
It's a pause.

23:25.897 --> 23:27.569
Somebody took
something of mine.

23:27.569 --> 23:29.571
I need to make sure
that can't happen again.

23:29.571 --> 23:32.574
And then you can go again.

23:32.574 --> 23:34.543
When?

23:34.543 --> 23:37.271
Soon.

23:37.271 --> 23:39.746
I need to do
some shopping first.

23:53.221 --> 23:55.861
Okay, that's 10 rolls
of duct tape,

23:55.861 --> 23:58.897
6 rolls of electrical tape,
10 toggle switches,

23:58.897 --> 24:01.966
4 bags of wire nuts,
wire cutters,

24:01.966 --> 24:04.540
2 small
12-volt batteries.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.542
That'll be $449.49.

24:06.542 --> 24:07.675
Do you take cash?

24:10.944 --> 24:12.174
Sure.

24:18.754 --> 24:21.051
Sorry. Got to make sure
you're not a counterfeiter

24:21.051 --> 24:22.657
or drug dealer.

24:22.657 --> 24:24.120
Definitely not
that interesting.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.056
Uh, network security,
you know,

24:26.056 --> 24:28.223
making sure people don't get
hacked, that sort of thing.

24:28.223 --> 24:32.095
You need duct tape
for network security?

24:32.095 --> 24:34.966
No, I need duct tape
for a personal project

24:34.966 --> 24:40.235
that engages my mind because
network security is very boring.

24:40.235 --> 24:41.775
Especially during
the pandemic.

24:41.775 --> 24:43.678
You'd be shocked
how careless people get

24:43.678 --> 24:46.978
when you give them instructions
over the Internet.

24:46.978 --> 24:48.749
Look where I work.

24:48.749 --> 24:50.586
I can totally believe it.

24:53.655 --> 24:56.658
Hey, you can get that.
It's fine.

24:56.658 --> 24:59.595
Nah. Work.
It's always work.

24:59.595 --> 25:00.893
Don't worry about it.

25:00.893 --> 25:02.961
Did you want to join
our rewards program?

25:02.961 --> 25:04.831
No, I'm good.
- You sure?

25:04.831 --> 25:07.196
'Cause, I mean, you get 20% off
and you have a huge order.

25:07.196 --> 25:10.034
I said I'm good!

25:10.034 --> 25:12.575
Um, my bad.

25:15.008 --> 25:16.040
Sorry.

25:17.142 --> 25:18.911
Who's that?

25:18.911 --> 25:20.946
Ah, that's Moose.

25:20.946 --> 25:22.211
He's my floof.

25:24.215 --> 25:27.150
You know, network security,
home security,

25:27.150 --> 25:28.954
we work hand in hand.

25:28.954 --> 25:32.254
Security cameras,
motion-sensor lights.

25:32.254 --> 25:34.256
It's all the same.
Nothing beats a dog.

25:34.256 --> 25:37.094
Not Moose.
He's a big old goofball.

25:38.801 --> 25:40.262
You don't say?

25:40.262 --> 25:42.132
Mm-hmm.

25:42.132 --> 25:45.641
Well, Tawny,
- thank you for everything.

25:54.377 --> 25:58.984
What if who's ever running the
network is as good as Garcia?

25:58.984 --> 26:01.019
You know,
our spinal-cord guy

26:01.019 --> 26:02.757
knew the Sullivans'
phone number.

26:02.757 --> 26:05.254
He knew when and where
they were meeting their bulls.

26:05.254 --> 26:08.026
So far, our remote Garcias
have found nothing.

26:08.026 --> 26:11.029
If Sicarius and his followers
are as good at hacking

26:11.029 --> 26:14.032
as they are at murder,
we're in trouble.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.737
Who's Sicarius?

26:15.737 --> 26:17.706
Uh, Tara said that's
what they're naming

26:17.706 --> 26:19.169
the shipping container UnSub.

26:19.169 --> 26:21.710
I'm not gonna name
this jag-off.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.372
Fuckhead! Okay?
Call him that.

26:24.372 --> 26:26.176
I want to know
how to catch him.

26:26.176 --> 26:28.915
Go about that the same way
we would a terrorist cell

26:28.915 --> 26:30.851
or a Mafia family, right?

26:30.851 --> 26:33.051
One case at a time
and hope that our UnSub

26:33.051 --> 26:35.020
gives us the whole network.

26:35.020 --> 26:37.726
Well, then let's focus
on this case.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.156
Where are we
with the profile?

26:39.156 --> 26:41.422
Still nowhere on
- the jealous-husband front.

26:41.422 --> 26:42.962
I mean, the guys
that I questioned,

26:42.962 --> 26:45.327
they're all beta males,
nonviolent type.

26:45.327 --> 26:46.867
I'm beginning to think

26:46.867 --> 26:48.264
we're looking in
the wrong suspect pool.

26:48.264 --> 26:49.804
Yeah, I am, too.

26:49.804 --> 26:52.873
Especially after watching
that murder video.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.877
Okay, so sending the husband
homemade porn

26:56.877 --> 26:59.275
is part of the cuckold kink, right?

26:59.275 --> 27:02.245
The bull gets off
on the power and control.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.950
That's why our profile's off.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.953
If we rebuild the profile
based around the theory

27:06.953 --> 27:08.416
that it's a bull
killing other bulls,

27:08.416 --> 27:10.858
I think we'll get farther.

27:10.858 --> 27:12.354
Do it.

27:17.898 --> 27:19.295
Penelope?

27:19.295 --> 27:21.429
<i>I need to see you.</i>

27:21.429 --> 27:23.200
I don't know what it is.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.137
Just material evidence
in an FBI investigation.

27:26.137 --> 27:28.843
However, 13 additional
encryption links

27:28.843 --> 27:30.240
are embedded in there.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.341
My guess is it's more
coordinates, but mnh.

27:32.341 --> 27:34.948
You should have the me's-who-
are-not-as-good-as-me crack it.

27:34.948 --> 27:36.818
That's kind of suspicious,
don't you think?

27:36.818 --> 27:39.315
I mean, somebody e-mails
this to you on the same day

27:39.315 --> 27:42.890
that we uncover
a serial killer network?

27:42.890 --> 27:45.222
Suspicious, coincidence,
not my department anymore.

27:45.222 --> 27:46.861
Well,
maybe it ought to be,

27:46.861 --> 27:48.929
'cause this is the second time
they've pulled you in.

27:48.929 --> 27:51.459
And now somebody
is feeding you clues.

27:51.459 --> 27:55.903
We need you to get
to the bottom of this.

27:55.903 --> 27:57.773
Mm.

27:57.773 --> 28:00.039
What?

28:00.039 --> 28:01.040
Nothing.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.239
No.
Hey, hey, hey.

28:02.239 --> 28:04.010
What? No, wait.
You can tell me.

28:04.010 --> 28:05.506
Talk to me.
What?

28:07.543 --> 28:10.115
Have you gone to therapy
since Krystall died?

28:10.115 --> 28:11.380
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

28:11.380 --> 28:13.085
You said I could say it.
Yeah, well, alright.

28:13.085 --> 28:14.482
Well, that's a little judgy,
don't you think?

28:14.482 --> 28:16.484
I am not judgy.
I think that you are.

28:16.484 --> 28:19.256
I'll grieve in my own way.
Thank you very much.

28:19.256 --> 28:21.555
And I wish other people
would respect that.

28:21.555 --> 28:23.194
I do.
I do respect it.

28:23.194 --> 28:25.526
It's just that I've been
going to therapy, okay?

28:25.526 --> 28:27.363
And-- And one
of the things

28:27.363 --> 28:29.233
that my licensed clinical social
worker, Tristan, helped me see

28:29.233 --> 28:30.872
after they picked their jaw
up off the floor

28:30.872 --> 28:32.940
from learning of all the things
I've survived,

28:32.940 --> 28:36.141
I have been absorbing trauma
since I was really young

28:36.141 --> 28:38.077
and thinking I was some sort
of hero for doing it.

28:38.077 --> 28:42.884
And then I got a job
for 15 years

28:42.884 --> 28:44.116
where even when you do
the right thing,

28:44.116 --> 28:46.052
even when you stop
serial killers,

28:46.052 --> 28:47.988
your body is absorbing
that trauma.

28:47.988 --> 28:50.122
And I'm not a hero
for holding on to it

28:50.122 --> 28:52.058
because trauma
has to be off-loaded.

28:52.058 --> 28:55.127
It has to be transformed,
or your body will destroy you.

28:55.127 --> 29:01.397
And [Sighs] Dave,
when I look at you...

29:01.397 --> 29:04.235
ever since you found out
about Krystall's diagnosis--

29:04.235 --> 29:06.039
I think it's better
we don't go there.

29:06.039 --> 29:07.370
Right. Okay.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.207
What I mean is, you know
how everybody's life

29:09.207 --> 29:10.505
fell apart
during the pandemic

29:10.505 --> 29:12.914
but then there was
a handful of people

29:12.914 --> 29:15.510
that were thriving
from sheltering in place?

29:15.510 --> 29:17.347
I am one of those people.

29:17.347 --> 29:19.019
My resting heart rate
is stellar.

29:19.019 --> 29:20.889
I'm eating even more phytonutrients.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.320
I-I'm meditating.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.026
You should try that, actually.

29:26.026 --> 29:28.094
I did.
I kept falling asleep.

29:28.094 --> 29:29.392
Me too.
- That was happening to me.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.592
You need to--
Not the point.

29:31.592 --> 29:38.170
My point right now is,
I miss the team every day.

29:38.170 --> 29:42.042
I miss you every day.

29:42.042 --> 29:43.945
But I don't miss the work.

29:50.215 --> 29:55.187
Can I give you a hug
so I know we're okay?

29:55.187 --> 29:57.959
I'm gonna take your silence
as consent.

30:03.063 --> 30:05.362
This is how
I profile people.

30:13.238 --> 30:16.076
I really am happy
for you.

30:16.076 --> 30:18.309
More than that,
I'm jealous.

30:18.309 --> 30:21.642
I want what you have.

30:21.642 --> 30:26.449
But right now
I've got a job to do.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.451
You got to go catch
a bad guy.

31:13.465 --> 31:16.004
Aah! No!
Help!

31:23.211 --> 31:24.408
He took a woman
this time?

31:24.408 --> 31:25.607
Are we sure
it's the same UnSub?

31:25.607 --> 31:27.279
Yeah.
Michelle Tucker.

31:27.279 --> 31:28.511
Lives in
Frederick, Maryland.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.282
Her husband
reported her missing.

31:30.282 --> 31:32.515
Police found her abandoned car
at a Costco.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.418
Not a Wal-Mart,
but close enough.

31:34.418 --> 31:36.618
That's a huge shift
in victimology.

31:36.618 --> 31:37.718
Why change now?

31:37.718 --> 31:39.753
I'm thinking
because he had to.

31:39.753 --> 31:41.997
We got the tox screen
results back,

31:41.997 --> 31:43.691
and the drugs that he uses
for the surgeries,

31:43.691 --> 31:46.595
they're paralytics
- to immobilize the victim, sure,

31:46.595 --> 31:49.004
but they're
typically prescribed

31:49.004 --> 31:50.599
to treat pain
from a back injury.

31:50.599 --> 31:52.568
So if this medication
is his,

31:52.568 --> 31:54.570
his condition could tell us
something about him.

31:54.570 --> 31:56.605
There's only so many
200-pound men

31:56.605 --> 31:59.245
a guy with a back injury
can carry around.

31:59.245 --> 32:00.576
So he took Michelle.

32:00.576 --> 32:02.479
Maybe that was
out of convenience,

32:02.479 --> 32:05.053
but we can't rule out
a personal connection.

32:05.053 --> 32:08.584
It's like his kink
got turned inside out.

32:08.584 --> 32:10.256
What do you mean?

32:10.256 --> 32:14.755
One side effect of back injuries
is erectile dysfunction.

32:14.755 --> 32:18.165
Our fears come out
in our sex lives.

32:18.165 --> 32:20.464
We hate to admit it,
but it's true.

32:20.464 --> 32:23.236
He can't
perform anymore.

32:23.236 --> 32:25.370
So he's punishing anyone
who still can.

32:25.370 --> 32:30.276
Severing the spinal cord
is his only way to feel virile.

32:31.444 --> 32:33.147
Is the husband
on his way in?

32:33.147 --> 32:34.247
Yeah.
Just landed.

32:34.247 --> 32:35.545
Give him our profile.

32:35.545 --> 32:39.384
Somehow he and Michelle
know this guy.

32:39.384 --> 32:41.254
No, no,
this can't be happening.

32:41.254 --> 32:44.092
Mr. Tucker,
- we're doing everything we can,

32:44.092 --> 32:47.425
but our best hope depends on you
being completely honest here.

32:47.425 --> 32:50.428
Yeah, yeah,
whatever you need.

32:50.428 --> 32:52.529
Who was Michelle seeing
last night?

32:54.830 --> 32:57.336
This guy.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.374
Wait a minute.
That's the same number

33:02.374 --> 33:04.574
that sent the video
to the Sullivans.

33:04.574 --> 33:07.577
Gonna do a reverse
image search here.

33:11.812 --> 33:15.189
This is from a sexy
firefighters calendar.

33:15.189 --> 33:17.587
You and Michelle
were catfished.

33:17.587 --> 33:19.655
What?

33:19.655 --> 33:24.792
Mr. Tucker, Michelle
was targeted for a reason.

33:24.792 --> 33:27.333
Maybe because you'd seen
this bull before.

33:27.333 --> 33:30.270
A man who recently suffered
a back injury

33:30.270 --> 33:32.800
who can't perform anymore.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.835
Does any of this
ring a bell?

33:38.478 --> 33:40.709
Robert Harris.

33:40.709 --> 33:42.810
Okay.

33:42.810 --> 33:45.450
Who is he?

33:45.450 --> 33:48.453
He promised the best sex
Michelle was ever gonna have.

33:48.453 --> 33:52.193
But a couple months ago, he got
into a motorcycle accident,

33:52.193 --> 33:54.624
so we found another bull.

33:54.624 --> 33:56.428
Salt in the wound.

33:56.428 --> 33:58.166
Telling him
he's not good enough.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.365
He'd attack that.

33:59.365 --> 34:00.828
Okay, we need everything
you have on him.

34:00.828 --> 34:04.436
Phone number, address,
car, anything.
- Yeah.

34:04.436 --> 34:08.638
Mindfulness voice: <i>You might
feel intrusive thoughts.</i>

34:08.638 --> 34:11.278
<i>That's perfectly natural.</i>

34:14.611 --> 34:17.383
<i>Just observe those thoughts.</i>

34:17.383 --> 34:20.386
<i>Like a twig floating
on a stream.</i>

34:27.888 --> 34:31.199
Yeah, Riley?
How are you?

34:31.199 --> 34:32.497
Riley?

34:32.497 --> 34:34.565
<i>HelperCat 220?</i>

34:34.565 --> 34:36.204
Y-Yes?

34:36.204 --> 34:38.833
<i>Did you decrypt it?</i>

34:38.833 --> 34:40.307
Oh, my God, it's you.

34:40.307 --> 34:41.935
<i>Did you decrypt it?</i>

34:41.935 --> 34:43.805
No.
I mean, yes, but no.

34:43.805 --> 34:45.180
<i>Why not?</i>

34:45.180 --> 34:46.478
Because I gave it
to the FBI.

34:46.478 --> 34:48.546
<i>You what?</i>
Gave it to the FBI.

34:48.546 --> 34:50.482
Look, whoever you think I am,
I am not.

34:50.482 --> 34:52.517
<i>Then who are you?
Don't you understand?</i>

34:52.517 --> 34:53.947
<i>You're the only one
who could help me.</i>

34:53.947 --> 34:57.357
<i>Now, because you didn't,
people are gonna die!</i>

35:02.626 --> 35:04.661
H-Hello?

35:07.763 --> 35:10.766
P-Please, I-I don--
I don't know what this is.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.512
Why can't I move?

35:23.614 --> 35:26.287
Do you feel that?
- No.

35:26.287 --> 35:28.190
Why are you
doing this to me?

35:31.426 --> 35:34.592
Because you need to learn
who's in charge.

36:52.505 --> 36:55.574
Do you need my login
or passwo--

37:28.741 --> 37:30.378
Huh.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.643
What?

37:31.643 --> 37:33.007
Each link
has a different key.

37:33.007 --> 37:34.910
That means each one goes
to a different recipient.

37:34.910 --> 37:36.076
13 in all.

37:36.076 --> 37:38.716
Can you crack it?

37:38.716 --> 37:40.784
Can you turn this on, please?

37:40.784 --> 37:42.984
Turn the volume
all the way up.

Quiet, guys.

39:20.818 --> 39:22.083
Yeah, Tara?

39:22.083 --> 39:24.855
Something in the kill kit
just went active.

39:24.855 --> 39:26.527
Those are transponders.

39:26.527 --> 39:27.792
This is how the UnSubs

39:27.792 --> 39:30.025
are finding they kill kits
he's burying.

39:30.025 --> 39:31.092
Are you sure?

39:31.092 --> 39:33.193
Yeah,
because JJ and Alvez

39:33.193 --> 39:35.734
are heading for one
right now.

39:59.890 --> 40:02.794

You don't
have to do this.

40:17.644 --> 40:19.877
Okay?

40:19.877 --> 40:22.209
Whatever I did, I'm--
I'm sorry.

40:36.289 --> 40:37.895
What?

40:37.895 --> 40:39.699
You broke the rules, Robert.

40:39.699 --> 40:42.669
No, I didn't.

40:42.669 --> 40:45.705
I told you to pause,
and you didn't.

40:45.705 --> 40:48.741
I told you to work
- from a secondary location,

40:48.741 --> 40:49.940
and you didn't.

40:49.940 --> 40:52.547
And do you know
how I know that?

40:52.547 --> 40:54.681
Because of
the fucking beeping

40:54.681 --> 40:56.012
that we are both hearing
right now!

41:04.152 --> 41:07.089
I-I didn't do this.
I don't know how that happened.

41:07.089 --> 41:08.695
I do.
You got sloppy.

41:08.695 --> 41:11.060
And now the police
are on their way to you.

41:11.060 --> 41:13.293
And you know
what that means.

41:15.704 --> 41:18.298
I-I can't.

41:18.298 --> 41:22.236
Well, if you can't,
then I will.

41:29.881 --> 41:33.049
Now, let me
talk you through it.

42:28.940 --> 42:31.844
Robert Harris killed himself.
Same as Rory Gilcrest.

42:31.844 --> 42:34.979
And just like Rory, nothing
about him profiled as suicidal.

42:34.979 --> 42:38.081
Whoever Sicarius is, he must
have something on these guys.

42:38.081 --> 42:40.413
Or that's the Devil's Bargain
for joining the network.

42:40.413 --> 42:42.822
Kill yourself
before you get caught.

42:42.822 --> 42:45.220
Good for him.
Bad for us.

42:45.220 --> 42:47.156
We just lost
our best lead.

42:47.156 --> 42:49.125
It's okay.
We've got others.

42:49.125 --> 42:50.225
We do?

42:50.225 --> 42:51.963
I'll explain.

42:51.963 --> 42:55.901
Go interview them first
so they can go home.

42:55.901 --> 42:58.904
Hey, guys.

43:04.008 --> 43:05.372
This is bad.

43:09.444 --> 43:12.852
<i>Bull sharks can live
in both salt and fresh water.</i>

43:12.852 --> 43:15.184
Hi, baby. Come here.
<i>Its diet consists of fish,</i>

43:15.184 --> 43:19.254
<i>stingrays, crustaceans.</i> Hi.

43:22.963 --> 43:25.733

43:25.733 --> 43:29.902

43:29.902 --> 43:32.432
<i>so its prey

43:32.432 --> 43:34.137
<i>It commonly utilizes...</i>

43:34.137 --> 43:37.811
13 signals
just went to 12.

43:37.811 --> 43:40.077
11.
- What the hell?

43:40.077 --> 43:42.948
We turned them on,
- and now someone turned them off,

43:42.948 --> 43:45.181
which means he knows
that we're on to him.

43:49.792 --> 43:52.925
Did I just
make things worse?

43:52.925 --> 43:54.157
No.

43:54.157 --> 43:56.764
You did
what you always do.

43:57.833 --> 43:59.327
You helped.

44:05.003 --> 44:08.468
Can you stop them
without me?

44:08.468 --> 44:10.272
Honestly?

44:12.177 --> 44:13.341
I don't know.

44:15.477 --> 44:17.378
I need a moment.

44:41.877 --> 44:45.912
Yeah. This is Mr. Rossi,
Room 1805.

44:45.912 --> 44:49.344
I'm gonna be checking out.

44:49.344 --> 44:50.851
Thanks.

46:52.170 --> 46:53.402
You're home.

46:53.402 --> 46:56.141
Yeah.
I didn't want to wake you.

46:56.141 --> 46:57.604
When'd you get in?
- Just now.

46:57.604 --> 47:00.112
I missed my connecting.
I'm lucky I got a flight in.

47:00.112 --> 47:02.213
You want me
to pour you a cup?
No, I'm good.

47:02.213 --> 47:04.611
I got enough gas in the tank
to make breakfast for the girls.

47:04.611 --> 47:06.646
Then I'll hit the hay.
Wait, are you sure?

47:06.646 --> 47:08.956
Because that would be
a really big help.

47:08.956 --> 47:10.023
Yeah, sure I'm sure.

47:10.023 --> 47:12.091
Aww.

47:12.091 --> 47:13.554
Best husband ever.

47:21.100 --> 47:24.532
The boys are out the door,
so I'm gonna head into work.

47:27.108 --> 47:29.306
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

47:32.014 --> 47:33.574
You doing alright?

47:37.382 --> 47:40.086
Do you think our fears
come out in our sex life?

47:43.751 --> 47:44.992
Am I in trouble?

47:47.161 --> 47:48.193
No.

47:50.393 --> 47:51.933
That's good.

47:53.596 --> 47:55.464
I think about
our life sometimes,

47:55.464 --> 48:00.700
and I realize it's crazy
that we ever made it.

48:00.700 --> 48:04.275
And now our whole reality
is this giant clock

48:04.275 --> 48:07.608
counting down the seconds
between school drop-off

48:07.608 --> 48:09.280
and-- and family dinners
and--

48:09.280 --> 48:10.677
Dead bodies.

48:10.677 --> 48:13.350
Yeah, that too.

48:13.350 --> 48:17.420
And the truth is,
- there isn't enough time.

48:18.786 --> 48:21.292
There never is.

48:21.292 --> 48:24.064
And that--

48:24.064 --> 48:26.231
That's my fear.

48:26.231 --> 48:29.399
We have full-time jobs
and two kids.

48:29.399 --> 48:31.368
We're doing the best
we can.

48:45.184 --> 48:46.713
Maybe.

48:46.713 --> 48:49.122
Maybe we could
do better.

48:56.228 --> 48:59.561
If we can't...

48:59.561 --> 49:03.202
make date night...

49:03.202 --> 49:05.468
we could always do
date morning.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.741
Morning.
- Morning.

49:14.741 --> 49:16.776
Glad you're back.

49:16.776 --> 49:18.811
I never left.

49:18.811 --> 49:22.386
Hello.
How are we doing?

49:22.386 --> 49:24.718
You look great.

49:24.718 --> 49:27.259
Oh, come on.
- What?

49:27.259 --> 49:30.229
Is everybody around here
getting laid except me?

49:30.229 --> 49:32.561
Well, I'm not.

49:32.561 --> 49:34.530
Wow.
- I'm sorry.

49:34.530 --> 49:36.730
Gallows humor, but it's all
I've got right now.

49:36.730 --> 49:39.667
You know what? I will take
gallows humor over no humor.

49:39.667 --> 49:41.207
What do we have?

49:41.207 --> 49:42.769
Tara's girlfriend needs
to tell us something

49:42.769 --> 49:44.276
about Director Bailey.

49:44.276 --> 49:46.542
Good news
or bad news?

49:46.542 --> 49:49.578
Wait,
did you say girlfriend?

49:52.352 --> 49:54.814
Hey, can we, uh,
close the door?

50:00.129 --> 50:02.591
What I'm about
to tell you is classified.

50:02.591 --> 50:05.660
If anyone finds out this came
from me, I'll be fired.

50:05.660 --> 50:07.233
Understood.

50:08.896 --> 50:10.566
Part of Doug Bailey's skill set

50:10.566 --> 50:12.700
is knowing
where the department's focus is

50:12.700 --> 50:15.571
because funding
follows focus.

50:15.571 --> 50:17.507
And as I'm sure
you've read,

50:17.507 --> 50:19.509
the FBI considers
domestic terrorism

50:19.509 --> 50:22.512
to be the fastest growing threat
to this country.

50:22.512 --> 50:25.152
There's money
in fast-growing threats.

50:25.152 --> 50:27.385
There's none
in serial killers.

50:27.385 --> 50:29.288
He wants to shut down
the BAU.

50:29.288 --> 50:30.718
Not shut down.

50:30.718 --> 50:34.557
The proposal I saw
calls for a reorganization.

50:34.557 --> 50:37.626
The unit would be folded
under Domestic Terrorism.

50:37.626 --> 50:39.364
He can bring in
new leadership

50:39.364 --> 50:42.301
if he can show that
the current one is wasteful.

50:42.301 --> 50:43.467
But we're not.

50:43.467 --> 50:45.370
You are
as of his last budget.

50:45.370 --> 50:47.669
Something about
a shipping container.

50:47.669 --> 50:49.209
Son of a bitch.

50:49.209 --> 50:52.212
He's been setting us up
this whole time.

50:52.212 --> 50:53.807
What happens with us?

50:55.877 --> 50:58.284
Reassigned.

50:58.284 --> 50:59.483
Replaced.

51:02.191 --> 51:03.289
Retired.

51:06.459 --> 51:08.327
Rebecca, thank you.

51:08.327 --> 51:10.230
I need to speak with the unit, please.

51:15.796 --> 51:17.336
So is-- is this it?

51:18.436 --> 51:19.536
Is it over?

51:19.536 --> 51:21.241
No, it's not over.

51:21.241 --> 51:22.473
We're just getting started.

51:22.473 --> 51:23.771
Yeah, but what moves
do we have?

51:23.771 --> 51:25.740
I mean, the guy's
the Deputy Director.

51:25.740 --> 51:28.215
We use his own argument
against him.

51:28.215 --> 51:29.678
He wants
domestic terrorism.

51:29.678 --> 51:31.383
We have
a serial-killing network.

51:31.383 --> 51:33.319
That <i>is</i> domestic terrorism.

51:33.319 --> 51:37.191
If we catch them,
if we shut down the network,

51:37.191 --> 51:39.292
if we stop Sicarius...

51:39.292 --> 51:40.920
We justify what we do.

51:40.920 --> 51:43.296
Not even Bailey
can touch us.

51:43.296 --> 51:44.792
So it's a race.

51:44.792 --> 51:47.267
We've got to get to those
kill kits before the UnSubs.

51:47.267 --> 51:49.401
Yeah, and with no margin
for error.

51:49.401 --> 51:50.930
Once Bailey knows
what we're up to,

51:50.930 --> 51:53.273
he'll use any mistakes
against us.

51:53.273 --> 51:54.637
Maybe.

51:54.637 --> 51:56.969
But we have
a secret weapon.

52:03.976 --> 52:05.780
Let's get to work.
