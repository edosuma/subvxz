WEBVTT

00:51.092 --> 00:56.638
TlE ME UP! TlE ME DOWN!

03:05.018 --> 03:08.270
Go see the director
when you're finished, all right?

03:08.396 --> 03:09.688
Okay.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.531
Come in.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.825
Hi.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.870
You wanted to see me?
- Yes, sit down.

03:28.249 --> 03:32.711
The judge has decided
there's no reason to keep you here.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.506
He thinks you're ready
to rejoin society as of today.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.050
Great!

03:38.801 --> 03:41.053
You won't have
to run away anymore.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.347
You're free, Ricki.

03:44.724 --> 03:49.228
Though being free
also means being alone.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.774
l won't be there
to protect you anymore.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.527
You'll be responsible
for your own actions,

03:57.654 --> 03:59.655
like any other citizen.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.407
Don't worry. l'll manage.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.119
- What will you do?
- Get a job, start a family.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.373
Like any normal person.
- You're not a normal person.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.000
The judge says l am.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.419
What does he know?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.099
lt's 50,000 pesetas.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.768
lt's for the drawings

04:29.894 --> 04:33.146
and for the mad, passionate
moments you gave me.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.609
Thanks.
l promise not to spend them.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.736
Don't be silly.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.282
You'll need money
until you find a job.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.662
l listed a few places
you might apply.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.415
Now go,
and never come back.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.512
l said to leave.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.477
l want to thank you
for everything first.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.338
Running away, eh?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.965
No, this time
the judge says l can go.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.842
l'm fit to join society.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.886
Society!

05:46.054 --> 05:49.139
l belonged
to a society once too.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.600
lt was a gourmet society.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.686
But one day
they poisoned me.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.647
l'd be careful
if l were you.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.276
Here. Take this.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.613
lt's free.

06:08.326 --> 06:12.287
- What is it?
- That society's membership card.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.873
Cards are always handy.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.875
Got any credit cards?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.919
l'm clean out.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.088
l'm expecting a delivery.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.465
Great. See you later.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.934
- How much is that?
- Six hundred pelas.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.645
- Mom, what are pelas?
- Pesetas.

07:18.771 --> 07:22.774
- Hi.
- Hi. l'll be right with you.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.037
Your change.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.290
See you.
- Good-bye.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.461
- What'll it be?
- The heart in the window.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.927
- How much is it?
- Five hundred.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.098
- My bus!
- You don't want it wrapped?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.619
"Barajas Studios...

08:17.705 --> 08:19.915
therapeutic shooting...

08:20.082 --> 08:22.167
Marina Osorio."

08:33.261 --> 08:35.013
Marina.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.350
l'm taking my panties off.
They show.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.977
What's worse,
showing your panties or your pussy?

08:42.188 --> 08:45.732
That reminds me:
We're doing a number at the party tonight.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.651
l promised Maximo.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.819
- What kind?
- Something sexy.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.656
But nothing complicated.
From our old act.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.325
- l'm not sure l remember.
- Sure you do.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.203
Some tits here,
a little ass there.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.372
We'll kill two birds
with one stone.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.667
Both Maximo and the producer
will be thrilled.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.877
Whatever you say, boss.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.839
Marina, l didn't say
anything before,

09:10.216 --> 09:12.968
but l'm really proud of you.
- Silly.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.554
Keep it up, huh?

09:16.556 --> 09:19.975
- You lay it on too thick.
- l've got to lay something.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.853
l have to keep after them
so we can finish today.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.106
Hey, we could sing that one.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.109
And l have something
for you too.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.173
Cool.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.939
When the stroke left
half my body paralyzed,

11:31.065 --> 11:34.693
l thought l'd better hurry
and make another film

11:34.902 --> 11:38.029
before the other half went.
- Of course.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.365
Here l am,
doing my posthumous work.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.827
But you look so alive
in your electric chair!

11:43.953 --> 11:46.246
"Electric chair" - l like that.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.665
- l just meant -
- No, you're right.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.209
Since l've been confined
to this chair,

11:51.377 --> 11:53.795
l've felt hornier than ever.

11:54.004 --> 11:58.883
My wife says l'm regressing back
to childhood. She may be right.

11:59.051 --> 12:03.388
After a stroke, you have to learn
everything all over again:

12:03.556 --> 12:08.935
how to speak, how to read
and write, how to dance.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.480
But above all, you learn
you want to go on living,

12:12.606 --> 12:15.150
which, in my case,
means making movies.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.776
That was beautiful.

12:16.902 --> 12:20.029
The knives.
This is the fake.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.245
- Even she wasn't fooled.
- l was!

12:27.413 --> 12:30.206
You were not!
That one looks too phony.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.083
- About the couch -
- Later.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.836
- Later when?
- Later!

12:35.004 --> 12:37.797
Have you seen Marina?
- No.

12:38.924 --> 12:42.093
How would you describe
your film Midnight Phantom?

12:42.303 --> 12:45.054
l'd say it's a spin-off
of the horror genre.

12:45.264 --> 12:49.309
Aren't you worried about making
your comeback with a spin-off?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.603
l've always wanted
to make one.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.271
Marina!

12:53.439 --> 12:57.066
But l'm afraid it's turning out
to be rather personal.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.152
A personal spin-off?
How's that?

12:59.361 --> 13:03.406
When you put your heart and genitals
into something, it's always personal.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.533
You're known
as an actress's director.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.952
Genitals remind you
of actresses, eh?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.288
l meant from among
so many actresses,

13:10.414 --> 13:13.333
why choose
a porn actress and a junkie?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.799
lf you want
to leave here alive,

13:20.925 --> 13:24.886
don't mention the words
"porn" and "junkie" again!

13:46.325 --> 13:47.617
Hi, Maximo.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.163
- Hi.
- When do we start?

13:52.331 --> 13:55.834
The set isn't dressed.
How's your toothache?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.335
lt hurts a bit.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.712
They still haven't found you
some aspirin?

13:59.839 --> 14:00.880
Carlos!

14:01.006 --> 14:04.801
Careful! You'll wreck the set!
Come around this way.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.847
Jump.
Careful - you're a chubby one.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.641
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

14:12.935 --> 14:16.396
l promise not to mention
"porn" or "junkie" again.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.523
That's better.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.692
- Who's she?
- A journalist.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.779
- What's the next scene?
- My death scene.

14:25.239 --> 14:29.409
- How will you play that?
- Good question.

14:29.535 --> 14:33.496
How should l look
when he stabs me on the couch?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.295
Osvaldo.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.922
Like that!

14:46.343 --> 14:48.595
But don't say "Osvaldo."

14:48.721 --> 14:50.388
Don't say "Osvaldo."

14:55.269 --> 14:57.145
Like that?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.231
She's upset.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.359
Maximo, what scene
are we shooting?

15:03.527 --> 15:05.570
- With the phone.
- And then?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.531
lt's a circus around here.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.742
How can you concentrate?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.411
l worked
in a real circus as a kid.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.538
l trained horses, rodeo-style.

15:15.664 --> 15:19.542
l had a lasso, and some so-called
wild horses would come out.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.961
l'd round them up
and tame them -

15:22.087 --> 15:24.464
Are you listening?
- Yeah, l am.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.382
What did l say?

15:26.842 --> 15:29.427
You tamed and lassoed
and rode horses.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.680
l'd line them up
and stand on their backs

15:32.806 --> 15:35.892
and strike poses, you know?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.268
Excuse me.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.812
Come tell me about it.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.607
l had this short skirt
with tassels

15:42.733 --> 15:44.776
and a ponytail
down to my ass.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.611
l wish l'd seen it.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.533
Osvaldo,
don't you recognize me?

15:53.452 --> 15:57.038
- lt's me, Montse.
- Montse? You've changed!

15:57.665 --> 16:00.708
l gained a little weight
after we split up.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.796
You're bigger too.
- Yeah.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.799
Mind if l interview you?

16:07.967 --> 16:11.344
- You're a journalist now?
- And you're an actor?

16:11.553 --> 16:14.514
Kids, l have to talk you.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.810
- So what now?
- Wait. l have a -

16:18.936 --> 16:21.312
Maximo, we have to talk.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.981
Excuse me.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.566
My boots!

16:25.859 --> 16:29.737
The producer's wife likes the couch.
She wants it after the shoot.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.281
- So?
- lt might get splattered

16:32.408 --> 16:33.866
in the final slaughter.

16:33.993 --> 16:38.121
Very likely. lt's hard to stab a girl
without spilling blood.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.666
- You better speak to him.
- He doesn't want any blood?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.168
Sure, lots!
But not on the couch.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.796
- l'll change the ending.
- No, you won't!

16:47.006 --> 16:48.965
- l never liked it.
- You loved it!

16:49.091 --> 16:50.466
l'm changing it!

16:50.592 --> 16:52.969
- You have the script changes?
- ln a minute.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.179
Look, l want you to make
your movie.

16:55.347 --> 16:59.475
Why should you compromise
'cause her twat's dripping for the couch?

16:59.601 --> 17:02.645
lt's not a compromise.
l've got a better ending.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.231
Marina, you won't die.
l'll save you.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.733
No stabbing?

17:06.858 --> 17:10.194
l'd just gotten used to the idea.
What now?

17:10.362 --> 17:12.946
You mind bearing
with your toothache a bit longer?

17:13.073 --> 17:14.198
No, why?

17:14.366 --> 17:17.617
lt gives you the perfect expression
for the scene.

17:17.744 --> 17:20.788
- Well, since it's already there -
- Thanks, sweetie.

17:20.914 --> 17:23.374
He'll be the end
of my producing career.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.542
He's the nicest director
l've ever had.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.046
That's just it.
He'd like to be even nicer.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.049
You knew that, yet you still
took off your panties!

17:31.175 --> 17:34.635
- So what?
- So he sees that, gets aroused,

17:34.762 --> 17:38.097
and changes everything
so he can save you!

17:51.904 --> 17:53.237
Yes?

17:56.366 --> 17:58.284
Oh, it's you.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.788
No, l feel much better.

18:03.332 --> 18:07.126
Yes, thank the police for me.
That's right.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.088
Not today.
l'll see them tomorrow.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.590
Tonight l need some sleep.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.346
Darling, we've got
our whole future ahead of us.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.390
Of course l adore you.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.312
Give me the gruesome
details tomorrow.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.191
Yes, l adore you.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.692
Good-bye, darling.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.903
Good-bye.

18:40.994 --> 18:44.080
Come out from there.
l've been expecting you.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.583
Even though
they told you l was dead?

18:49.002 --> 18:53.464
l knew you wouldn't die
without saying good-bye.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.264
l'm not here
to say good-bye.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.559
l'm taking you away with me.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.981
Where are you taking me?

19:10.149 --> 19:15.194
To a quiet place
where we can be happy.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.822
- No.
- What?

19:18.574 --> 19:22.869
First take off your mask
and let me see me your face.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.624
l have no face.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.626
You must have something there.

19:30.794 --> 19:34.380
lf you're taking me away,
l may as well get used to it.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.716
You really want to see it?

19:37.843 --> 19:38.843
Yes.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.809
l can't.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.604
Look at my body.
lt's full of life!

19:52.357 --> 19:54.567
But my face

19:55.152 --> 19:57.778
is the face of a corpse!

19:58.030 --> 20:01.866
You offer me only death,
and death rarely brings happiness.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.392
Cut! That's a wrap.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.646
Help the actress down.
- Hold on!

20:31.772 --> 20:33.147
Nobody leave!

20:33.357 --> 20:37.401
Someone stole my Walkman,
and Osvaldo's missing 1 0,000 pesetas.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.779
- The handcuffs too.
- And some props.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.323
And my 1 0,000 pesetas!

20:42.532 --> 20:44.408
No, l took those.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.245
Return everything
and there'll be no reprisals.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.747
l'm responsible
for all this stuff.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.708
l'd love to take things too,
but l don't.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.585
You were great, Marina.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.420
- Who was it?
- Relax, Lola.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.257
The shoot is finished.
You won't be fired.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.384
- l guess not.
- Let's celebrate.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.303
- Who was it?
- Let's have some champagne.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.973
Yeah, alcohol might
loosen some tongues.

21:54.354 --> 21:59.483
- Don't stare at me like that.
- l'm not staring. l'm admiring.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.819
Well, don't.

22:06.867 --> 22:10.661
- What's the hurry?
- l'm soaked. What do you want?

22:10.829 --> 22:14.498
- Nothing. You wouldn't like it.
- Then don't tell me.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.293
- Will l see you at the party?
- Of course.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.683
Hi.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.101
Sorry.

22:34.436 --> 22:38.606
Can l talk to you a second?
- Not now. Some other time.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.444
Marina, look!

22:44.571 --> 22:45.946
Look!

22:54.164 --> 22:56.082
l'm not going to eat them.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.377
- You got keys to my place?
- You locked yourself out again?

22:59.503 --> 23:01.587
l don't know.
l can't find them.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.340
- You gotta pull it together.
- See you.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.385
You really should come
to the party.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.763
l can't. l don't want to.
l won't discuss it.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.681
- What do you want?
- My pay.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.153
- Where's the car?
- Around the corner.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.908
l'll get it.
- Okay.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.743
- What's its name?
- Paquita.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.620
Like my niece.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.707
Show me your hoof.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.960
Poor baby!
She's got a corn.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.255
- What's that?
- A bruise on her hoof.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.883
You better unshoe her.
- Who'll pull the cart?

23:48.009 --> 23:50.219
lf you don't,
gangrene will set in.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.513
Make a plaster
of bran and vinegar,

23:52.639 --> 23:55.182
put it in some burlap,
and wrap her hoof.

23:55.308 --> 23:58.561
Take it off 24 hours later
and clean it with iodine.

23:58.728 --> 24:01.105
When it dries, she'll be fine.
Right?

24:01.231 --> 24:04.525
Don't let them treat you bad.
She really could die.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.611
- Thanks a lot.
- Good-bye.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.990
The young lady's right.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.200
You see?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.581
"Hazelnut chocolates."

25:43.542 --> 25:45.376
Maximo.

26:45.562 --> 26:48.355
- Who is it?
- Pepe, your neighbor.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.734
Hi.
Where are you going?

26:51.860 --> 26:56.113
On vacation, to forget
that nightmare of a film.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.533
Give any important mail to Lola.
She has my address.

26:59.659 --> 27:00.743
Okay.

27:00.869 --> 27:04.163
l don't know how you did it,
but you were marvelous.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.624
- You think so?
- Absolutely!

27:06.750 --> 27:10.294
l just did what Maximo said,
even when l didn't understand.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.505
You'll have to tell me your secret
when l get back.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.467
- When's that?
- ln a couple weeks.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.302
Enjoy yourself.

27:18.678 --> 27:21.930
And get laid.
- lf l do, l'm not coming back.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.183
You'll never change.

27:42.535 --> 27:43.786
Pepe...

27:48.124 --> 27:51.043
- What do you want?
- Relax.

27:52.128 --> 27:55.756
What are you doing?
He has my keys!

28:04.307 --> 28:06.100
Don't scream!

28:13.024 --> 28:14.858
l said not to scream!

28:19.698 --> 28:22.574
l told her not to scream.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.719
Hi.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.725
- Who are you?
- The guy who attacked you.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.477
Does it hurt?

28:51.020 --> 28:52.771
Damn it.

28:52.981 --> 28:55.441
Get out right now
or l'm calling the cops!

28:55.567 --> 28:59.236
l had to hit you,
but l didn't mean to hurt you.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.488
l said get out.

29:01.698 --> 29:04.575
Shit! Looks like
a pharmacy in here.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.745
Didn't mean to hurt me?
You broke my tooth!

29:07.912 --> 29:09.872
l said l'm sorry.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.874
You're sorry?

29:37.275 --> 29:39.276
So you want to fuck me?

29:39.486 --> 29:41.612
Go on.
Get it over with.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.530
Relax.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.575
We'll fuck
when the time is right.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.953
Then what do you want?

29:50.872 --> 29:52.623
l'll tell you.

29:53.249 --> 29:56.126
Let's lie down on the bed.
We'll be more comfortable.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.046
Watch the glass.

30:15.313 --> 30:18.482
l tried to talk to you,
but you wouldn't let me,

30:19.067 --> 30:23.654
so l had to kidnap you
so you could get to know me.

30:24.823 --> 30:29.368
l'm sure you'll fall in love with me,
just as l'm in love with you.

30:34.582 --> 30:38.418
l'm 23 years old,
l have 50,000 pesetas,

30:38.837 --> 30:41.004
and l'm all alone in the world.

30:42.423 --> 30:45.133
l'll try to be
a good husband to you

30:45.260 --> 30:47.636
and a good father
for your kids.

31:08.366 --> 31:12.035
- So you stole all those things?
- l tried to talk to you.

31:12.996 --> 31:17.416
- And you did the handstand.
- Yeah, sometimes l show off a bit.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.502
So that's why
you look familiar.

31:20.628 --> 31:25.215
We met once a year ago
at a bar called Lulu's.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.175
Remember?

31:31.180 --> 31:33.473
l'd just escaped
from the institution.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.642
We met by chance at Lulu's.

31:37.770 --> 31:41.815
We went to your place and fucked.
You don't remember?

31:43.693 --> 31:46.695
l promised to come back
and protect you.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.364
Lots of men have said that!

31:49.490 --> 31:52.367
But l'm here to prove it.
Now quit throwing things!

32:02.211 --> 32:04.755
Did you like the heart?

32:05.673 --> 32:07.966
Nice touch, huh?

32:34.911 --> 32:38.622
l know you understand

32:39.415 --> 32:42.292
The heaviness in my heart

32:43.962 --> 32:47.464
When l'm at your side

32:48.549 --> 32:51.760
My sorrow disappears

32:53.054 --> 32:56.932
l'll do anything you want

32:57.684 --> 32:59.851
The fault will all be yours

33:01.980 --> 33:05.565
For my heart is waiting

33:06.526 --> 33:09.403
Waiting for you once more

33:09.529 --> 33:10.862
She's a sweetheart.

33:11.155 --> 33:14.408
How did l ever bear

33:15.201 --> 33:18.704
Being so long without you

33:20.248 --> 33:23.875
How did l ever wait

33:24.460 --> 33:28.338
How did l hold on

33:29.298 --> 33:33.385
You know that deep inside

33:33.845 --> 33:37.764
l'm desperate and sad

33:38.349 --> 33:41.727
Ever since you left

33:42.854 --> 33:45.856
Life has lost all meaning

34:16.219 --> 34:18.847
l don't get it.
You took four pills!

34:19.556 --> 34:22.059
Regular painkillers
don't work for me.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.726
Why?

34:25.605 --> 34:27.813
l was hooked on smack before.

34:27.940 --> 34:31.860
When you're used to heroin,
painkillers don't do shit.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.821
l had no idea.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.408
Only morphine would help,
something like that.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.578
Morphine?
Where would l get that?

34:43.164 --> 34:46.583
The doctor who detoxed me
could give me something.

34:46.708 --> 34:48.710
We can't go to a doctor!

34:52.924 --> 34:57.177
What would you say?
"Meet a pal who just kidnapped me"?

34:57.303 --> 34:59.721
- Of course not.
- Then what?

35:01.516 --> 35:03.391
Nothing. l swear.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.186
And she's only
three blocks away.

35:06.312 --> 35:10.565
Please, l can't take it anymore.
l can't take it!

35:13.277 --> 35:15.570
Besides, this is your fault.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.784
All right.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.745
But if you try any tricks,

35:23.955 --> 35:26.832
l swear l'll kill us both!

35:28.584 --> 35:31.419
Now go get dressed.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.137
You've got a great body.

36:00.867 --> 36:04.327
Don't bother.
l hid all the blades and scissors.

36:06.455 --> 36:09.207
Put some makeup
on your bruises.

36:12.336 --> 36:15.255
l like being
in the bathroom with you,

36:15.381 --> 36:17.591
like a married couple
that's going out.

36:23.848 --> 36:28.310
Marina, it's Lola. Pick up.
You're really something!

36:28.519 --> 36:30.896
l had to sing on my own.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.190
lf we hold hands,
the handcuffs won't show.

36:33.357 --> 36:36.109
...everyone was asking
about you.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.028
- Who's that?
- My sister.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.405
- What's she want?
- l don't know.

36:40.531 --> 36:43.366
l hope you haven't gone back
to your old ways.

36:43.492 --> 36:47.746
lf you've done something stupid,
hiding will only make it worse!

36:48.706 --> 36:50.498
Things were going so well.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.376
See you tomorrow, sweetie.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.212
l need a drink.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.964
- What would you like?
- A Dry 1 00.

36:58.090 --> 37:01.885
l don't care much for your face,
but your ass is another story.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.095
- Max!
- Give me a drink.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.640
You've had enough.
Forgive him, Lola.

37:06.766 --> 37:10.185
l drink too, but l don't
make fun of his stroke.

37:10.311 --> 37:14.314
Your ass and my stroke
are part and parcel of our culture.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.525
lt's true.
You were great.

37:17.652 --> 37:22.364
But we all missed Marina.
What's keeping her?

37:22.490 --> 37:24.157
l just spoke to her.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.576
Your rain scene
made her toothache worse.

37:26.744 --> 37:29.871
He told me all about it.
lt sounded amazing!

37:30.206 --> 37:33.083
Sure, it's great hanging
in the rain for hours

37:33.251 --> 37:35.252
like A Man Called Horse.

37:35.378 --> 37:39.130
Lola, please forgive
my alcohol-induced aggression...

37:39.298 --> 37:42.676
but while
l can't stand your mug,

37:42.802 --> 37:45.595
you've got a great pair of tits!

37:45.721 --> 37:47.681
lt's true.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.601
We shouldn't have come.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.312
Don't tell me that now.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.440
- What if someone else is there?
- She lives alone.

37:57.566 --> 37:59.526
What if she has company?

37:59.694 --> 38:01.486
l'll ask her.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.866
- Who is it?
- Berta, it's Marina.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.660
Come on up.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.745
Are you alone?

38:10.871 --> 38:13.498
Just me, myself, and l.
Come on up.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.709
All right.
How dare you?

38:27.638 --> 38:30.598
Don't try anything funny, eh?

38:32.727 --> 38:34.853
What's going on?
You scared me.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.147
l have a terrible toothache.

38:37.273 --> 38:41.776
That's a bad abscess.
l thought it might be something else.

38:41.902 --> 38:45.113
l'm Berta. Nice to meet you.
- Ricki. Same here.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.948
Come on in.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.702
l've taken four Fiorinals.
They didn't do a thing.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.163
l warned you
about the first few months.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.582
Watch out.
The table's dangerous.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.961
Painkillers are useless
after everything else you took.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.340
- Give me something strong.
- Sure, let me think.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.467
How about Sosegon?

39:05.676 --> 39:07.844
Toothaches are the worst.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.139
- Earaches are bad too.
- And colic.

39:11.265 --> 39:14.059
- Never had it.
- l have.

39:14.393 --> 39:17.062
Take this for a couple days,
no more.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.522
You can get hooked
on this too.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.234
And we know what a fiend
you can be. Right?

39:24.278 --> 39:25.820
Did she hit you?

39:27.406 --> 39:30.867
- No, l bumped into something.
- You're quite a pair.

39:37.166 --> 39:40.085
You want a joint?
- No, thank you.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.795
No, thanks.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.464
Marina, you look nervous.

39:44.590 --> 39:45.840
Calm down.

39:45.966 --> 39:49.344
- You look so uptight.
- l can't take it anymore.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.596
Give me something now.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.848
- A shot?
- Yes.

39:53.974 --> 39:56.476
l'll give you some Dolantin.

39:56.602 --> 39:59.062
You're a born dope fiend!

40:12.201 --> 40:14.744
The girls are awake.
l'll go rock them.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.621
- No!
- Why?

40:16.747 --> 40:18.540
Don't bother.

40:18.999 --> 40:22.127
l'll go.
- You don't mind?

40:26.757 --> 40:28.675
l really like your boyfriend.

40:31.220 --> 40:35.014
Sure you haven't taken anything?
You're very agitated.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.434
Let me see.
Your pupils are fine.

40:37.643 --> 40:40.103
Listen,
you have to call the cops!

40:40.271 --> 40:41.855
What about the cops?

40:46.235 --> 40:48.194
My babies!

40:48.320 --> 40:50.447
Why did you pick them up?

40:51.490 --> 40:53.783
l just had to hold them.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.243
Look at them.

40:59.582 --> 41:02.250
Don't worry.
The pain will be gone soon.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.085
Look, Marina.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.673
Ricki, let's go.

41:15.389 --> 41:18.433
What are you looking for?
l'm right here.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.811
Don't fuck around now.
- Let go of my hand!

41:21.979 --> 41:25.064
- The handcuffs will show.
- There's no one around.

41:25.232 --> 41:29.068
And why is that?
- A holiday weekend in August.

41:29.195 --> 41:32.822
The pain's gone, right?
l see it in your face.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.743
Want to buy the medicine anyway?
- Yes.

41:36.869 --> 41:39.787
Then hold my hand
and keep nice and quiet.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.510
- Someone's ringing.
- Let them.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.392
Someone's there.
l hear moaning.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.939
lt could be an emergency.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.941
Probably some junkie.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.527
Goddamn motherfuckers!

42:16.408 --> 42:17.867
Be careful.

42:19.119 --> 42:21.829
"Say no to rheumatism."

42:23.874 --> 42:25.750
Ma'am.

42:30.798 --> 42:34.092
- What is it?
- We need some Sosegon.

42:34.843 --> 42:36.386
l don't have any.

42:37.054 --> 42:40.557
- Lady, this isn't a holdup.
- Just in case.

42:40.683 --> 42:44.769
We have a legal prescription.
You can call the doctor and check.

42:44.895 --> 42:47.063
l said l don't have any.
Anything else?

42:47.189 --> 42:48.898
Yes, surgical tape.

42:53.195 --> 42:55.405
- What for?
- Let me handle it.

43:01.036 --> 43:04.581
You can get Sosegon
in the plaza in Chueca.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.417
The pharmacy's open there?

43:07.585 --> 43:11.045
What pharmacy?
On the street. The black market.

43:11.171 --> 43:13.881
You can get
all the pills you want.

43:24.268 --> 43:27.645
- What's the rush?
- Don't push your luck.

43:28.105 --> 43:30.732
What is it?
- l don't want to go inside.

43:31.108 --> 43:34.027
- What do you want?
- For you to let me go.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.820
lmpossible.

43:36.864 --> 43:39.032
Marina, be sensible.

43:39.950 --> 43:42.660
You want
another broken tooth?

43:42.828 --> 43:45.455
Let's go home.
Come on.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.915
Let's go.

44:06.685 --> 44:08.227
Come on.

44:21.825 --> 44:23.576
Now what?

44:23.744 --> 44:27.121
l'll take off the handcuffs
so you can get comfortable.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.749
- What for?
- l'll go get those pills.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.669
You lie down
and wait for me here.

44:37.633 --> 44:40.510
Turn around.
l don't want you to see me naked.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.345
Sure. Sorry.

44:43.764 --> 44:46.265
You don't happen
to have some rope

44:46.392 --> 44:48.184
or clothesline or something?

44:48.394 --> 44:49.852
What for?

44:51.689 --> 44:53.523
This will do.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.566
Too short.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.611
You got a rope or a cord?

44:58.737 --> 45:00.780
What are you going to do?

45:38.402 --> 45:40.945
You need anything?

45:41.113 --> 45:43.740
You want to write?
Or talk?

45:44.074 --> 45:46.200
Shall we play a game?

45:47.995 --> 45:50.496
Well, call if you need me.

45:50.622 --> 45:51.956
Okay.

46:00.340 --> 46:03.551
Years ago,
when a bullfighter got top honors,

46:03.927 --> 46:06.637
his fans
would carry him home

46:06.889 --> 46:09.432
and then wait until he appeared
on the balcony

46:09.600 --> 46:11.684
to give him one last ovation.

46:12.186 --> 46:14.854
l don't know
why l'm telling you this.

46:14.980 --> 46:18.608
l suppose because
l'm near my balcony

46:19.401 --> 46:22.320
and l wish l could see you
coming down the street

46:22.446 --> 46:24.614
to speak to me.

46:24.823 --> 46:27.617
Marina, it's Maximo.

46:30.078 --> 46:33.289
l don't know
if your tooth hurts or what.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.125
You don't want to answer?
Fine.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.962
But if you're avoiding me,
I'd Iike to know why.

46:42.883 --> 46:45.635
Well, call me tomorrow.

46:45.844 --> 46:49.472
l'll either be editing
or at home. Bye.

47:04.863 --> 47:07.406
No, my mustache will fall off.

47:11.495 --> 47:15.289
- You got Sosegon?
- No, but l got hash and scag.

47:15.415 --> 47:18.376
The chick
on the scooter's got pills.

47:23.131 --> 47:24.507
Thanks.

47:26.009 --> 47:28.344
Hey, you on the scooter!

47:28.679 --> 47:30.596
You got any Sosegon?

47:31.098 --> 47:33.349
Don't yell, you idiot!

47:33.517 --> 47:36.894
Take it easy.
l just asked if you had any.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.856
- How many you want?
- l don't know. A few.

47:40.023 --> 47:43.442
- My girl's got a toothache.
- Let's see some cash.

47:45.946 --> 47:47.363
l have more.

47:47.531 --> 47:50.533
Wait for me in the plaza.
l'll be right back.

48:09.136 --> 48:12.847
- l said to wait back there.
- Well, now that l'm here -

48:12.973 --> 48:15.558
- How many?
- Give me all you've got.

48:16.476 --> 48:17.727
What are you doing?

48:18.854 --> 48:20.563
Son of a bitch!

48:23.317 --> 48:25.568
- What's this?
- What do you think?

48:25.777 --> 48:27.904
You're a dead man!

48:40.250 --> 48:41.417
lt's me!

49:01.647 --> 49:03.606
Look what l brought you.

49:04.483 --> 49:06.442
You're gonna like it.

49:09.154 --> 49:11.030
She's out cold.

49:11.448 --> 49:14.033
All right.
l'm going to untie you

49:14.660 --> 49:19.413
so you don't think
l enjoy making you suffer.

49:20.290 --> 49:22.124
Let's see.

49:22.751 --> 49:26.587
She's going to wake up.

49:27.339 --> 49:29.799
Will she or won't she?

49:40.477 --> 49:43.729
Careful not to touch her pussy.

49:43.855 --> 49:45.314
That's it.

49:45.482 --> 49:47.984
Don't wake up...

49:52.906 --> 49:57.702
l better leave the gag on.
She's got a mouth on her.

49:58.203 --> 50:01.998
All right.
Let's get a little rest.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.666
lt's been quite a night.

50:15.137 --> 50:19.515
lf you knew how often
l've dreamed of lying here with you.

50:27.399 --> 50:29.859
Christ! What a hard-on!

50:37.534 --> 50:39.827
Maybe l'll jerk off.

50:40.078 --> 50:43.456
Feels kind of odd
with her here, though.

50:44.124 --> 50:47.043
Better just go to sleep.

52:33.733 --> 52:35.109
What are you doing?

52:39.447 --> 52:41.448
The pain came back.

52:41.575 --> 52:45.411
And you thought maybe
the keys would help, right?

52:46.204 --> 52:50.499
- No, l took the stuff you brought.
- That's how you thank me, eh?

52:51.960 --> 52:55.671
You dumb shit!
Can't you see l was testing you?

52:55.839 --> 52:57.506
You think l'm an idiot?

53:06.850 --> 53:10.853
How long will it take you
to fall in love with me?

53:11.021 --> 53:15.191
When will you realize
no one's gonna love you like l do?

53:38.381 --> 53:39.882
Poor thing.

53:40.008 --> 53:42.885
lt's more a love story
than a horror story.

53:43.053 --> 53:47.223
- They can be hard to tell apart.
- We've got a blockbuster.

53:47.766 --> 53:49.725
- What's wrong, Lola?
- Nothing.

53:49.893 --> 53:52.144
- You look worried.
- l have a hangover.

53:52.270 --> 53:54.688
- Have a Bloody Mary.
- Good idea.

53:54.814 --> 53:56.815
And order me one too.

53:57.025 --> 53:59.860
- All right.
- Me too.

54:00.028 --> 54:03.530
- Anything else? l'm off.
- The mag stock.

54:03.907 --> 54:06.283
- Tell Marina to call me.
- What for?

54:06.409 --> 54:10.037
- l need to talk to her.
- l'm on my way to her place.

54:10.163 --> 54:12.248
- Shall l go with you?
- Better not.

54:12.582 --> 54:16.627
Please tell her to call me.
l really miss her.

54:16.753 --> 54:18.921
l'll tell her. Bye.

54:59.129 --> 55:01.005
The washer's rotted.

55:11.683 --> 55:14.601
Here's your breakfast.
What are you doing?

55:17.814 --> 55:19.606
Hang on.

55:20.692 --> 55:22.818
Sorry.
- l have to pee.

55:23.403 --> 55:26.488
When you need to go,
just tell me.

55:26.740 --> 55:30.242
lf you have the gag on,
make some kind of sign.

55:32.662 --> 55:35.539
l drew a picture for you.
You like it?

55:54.976 --> 55:58.228
- Turn off that faucet!
- Just thought it might help.

55:59.564 --> 56:01.273
- Listen to me.
- What?

56:02.233 --> 56:04.234
l'll never love you!

56:04.361 --> 56:06.653
You hear me? Never!

56:08.365 --> 56:12.034
Don't say that yet.

56:13.870 --> 56:17.748
l'll never love you.
You're pathetic!

56:18.875 --> 56:21.251
Who asked you
to take care of me?

56:21.378 --> 56:23.796
Or protect me?

56:23.922 --> 56:27.966
Or be my husband
and the father of my kids? Who?

56:28.093 --> 56:31.011
Who asked
for your 50,000 pesetas?

56:31.554 --> 56:34.473
Keep them.
Spend them on some other woman.

57:00.834 --> 57:02.835
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

57:03.837 --> 57:06.839
l'll go get some antibiotics

57:06.965 --> 57:09.508
and a washer,
while l'm at it.

57:09.634 --> 57:11.093
A washer?

57:11.219 --> 57:13.887
For the kitchen faucet.

57:15.765 --> 57:19.435
l'll have to tie you up
a little.

57:22.564 --> 57:24.440
Lie down, please.

57:24.899 --> 57:27.943
Please. Come on.

57:31.197 --> 57:32.990
Sit up, please.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.037
- l don't like tying you up.
- Then don't.

57:39.247 --> 57:40.914
Shut up.

57:43.877 --> 57:46.628
Anything else you want?
- Different tape.

57:46.796 --> 57:48.797
This stuff's skinning me alive.

57:54.637 --> 57:56.889
l'm very upset, you know.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.435
Think a little.

58:01.561 --> 58:03.896
l know you have problems,

58:04.022 --> 58:06.940
but put yourself in my shoes
for a minute.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.777
lmagine how l feel
after what you said.

58:11.321 --> 58:13.947
After what l've done for you.

58:14.491 --> 58:18.327
No one's ever been that cruel -
and l've known some cruel people.

58:23.875 --> 58:25.375
Anyway...

58:26.002 --> 58:28.670
if you can...

58:29.631 --> 58:32.090
stop thinking
only about yourself

58:32.634 --> 58:35.344
and think a little
about others.

58:38.306 --> 58:41.850
Nobody ever called me
pathetic before - ever!

58:44.354 --> 58:47.564
"l'll never love you."

58:48.316 --> 58:50.108
We'll see about that.

59:15.718 --> 59:17.219
ln use.

59:32.569 --> 59:34.570
l'll deal with you later.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.278
Marina, are you there?
lt's Lola.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.488
Marina, please.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:59.821
l have paper,
extra-porous, hypoallergenic,

01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:01.782
silk tape
to go with formal wear.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:05.577
What's it for?
- Something easy to take off.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:08.538
This one with little holes
sells well.

01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:13.627
lt's not for your cut, right?
- No, it's for a girl.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.921
lt's very gentle.

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.215
This one's good.
l'll take it.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.467
Anything else?

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:23.720
- Yeah, antibiotics for a bad tooth.
- An infection?

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:09.785
"Marina, how can you disappear
without a word?"

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.662
l'm worried sick.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.957
lf l don't hear from you,
l'll have to call the cops,

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:17.876
and we wouldn't want that.

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:20.796
Whatever you've done,
there's always a solution.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.756
You're what's important.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.300
Please call me.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.969
Don't try and fix things
on your own.

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:31.306
lf you need to go cold turkey,
l'll be there for you.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.309
But let me hear from you, sweetie.
Lola.

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:47.155
l have a surprise.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:52.494
l'll take the gag off later.
First the surprise.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.261
Don't worry.
lt's a nice surprise.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:41.751
- Well? You like the place?
- l've been here before.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:51.344
Careful. There.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.682
Aren't you afraid
someone will find us?

01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:59.603
That's why we moved.
Who'd look for us here?

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.398
l'm not alone
in the world like you.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:06.902
l have my work, my family.
Someone will miss me.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:09.696
Sooner or later
they'll come looking.

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:15.994
Then we have to leave
right away.

01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:18.747
Your sister was here earlier.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:23.043
l didn't want to tell you,
but l almost ran into her.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.423
l've got it.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:33.511
Call her and say you've left town
with some friends.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:36.848
Then she won't bother us,
and she'll stop worrying too.

01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:39.559
- You'd really let me call her?
- Yes.

01:05:39.977 --> 01:05:41.978
But just to calm her down.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.942
One wrong word...

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:52.781
and l'll slit your throat
and then my own.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.868
Marina, l have nothing...

01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:59.663
so l have nothing to lose.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:06.127
Stop fiddling with that pepper.
Put it down.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.676
Give me that!

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.011
You're always getting in the -
- Mom?

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:18.640
- lt's Marina.
- Marina, how are you?

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.601
- Fine, and you?
- So-so.

01:06:21.727 --> 01:06:25.021
- Stop that, damn it!
- What's wrong?

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:28.692
Your niece
wants to know who it is.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.486
Mom, tell Lola
l'm not in Madrid.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.738
l'll tell her. Don't worry.

01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:37.117
l've come out to the country
with friends to rest.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.619
- Good idea.
- What's for lunch?

01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:42.706
Stop it!
What a brat!

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:47.585
l can't wait till her mother
comes and gets her.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:49.504
Anyway,
we're having pisto.

01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:51.715
Pisto...

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:54.676
- lt's delicious.
- l'm sorry l can't be there.

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:56.553
Don't worry.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:07:00.557
l'll put some in the fridge
for when you get back.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.893
l don't have a phone here,
but l'll call again.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.814
Call anytime.
l always want to hear from you.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.192
- Don't forget me.
- l won't.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.529
- Mom...
- What?

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:18.491
- l... l love you a lot.
- I Iove you too.

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:21.745
Take care of yourself.
- l will, Mom.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:24.706
- A big kiss.
- Bye.

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:41.723
Why do German retirees
spend their summers in Benidorm...

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.436
while poor Spanish retirees

01:07:46.645 --> 01:07:50.231
have to beg
outside the subway?

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.528
Because German retirees

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:58.865
think about the future
while they're still young,

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:01.201
while Spaniards...

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.912
Spaniards...

01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:34.484
Spanish retirees
only think of retirement

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:37.194
when it's too late.

01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:38.321
Next.

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:41.866
The Gerobank Retirement Plan.

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:44.327
Dance your old age away.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:51.501
So... what are your plans
for the future?

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.587
We'll get married
and have two or three kids.

01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:57.006
- Two or three kids?
- Or more.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.300
However many we need.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.848
l'm curious.
How will you support us?

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.015
l'll find a job.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.310
We'll go to Australia.
They need people there.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.273
But first l want you to see
my hometown.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.899
l haven't been back
since l was three.

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:20.113
Does it still hurt?
- Yeah, kind of.

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:23.658
Can l help?

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.202
l don't know.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.412
Maybe some horse.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:32.834
- Would that kill the pain?
- lt's the only thing that would.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:37.505
- l'll go get some.
- Thanks.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.352
Will you help me?

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:55.857
- You don't mind if l see you naked?
- Not anymore.

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:04.407
No, l can manage.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:14.876
l'll tie a gentle knot.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:18.379
- Easy on my wrists, please.
- This rope's the best.

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:21.758
So is the tape.
l tested it first.

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:24.886
Well, see you later.

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.641
Want it open?

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.440
You can look at the stars
while you wait.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:59.837
l think he's pretty worried.
He wants to call early elections.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.216
l'm worried too, man.
l got plenty of problems.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:08.763
Yeah, but if he pulls it off,
we'll be in good shape too.

01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:11.015
- You believe all that?
- Yeah.

01:11:11.141 --> 01:11:14.686
Hell, man, l'm working
my ass off like a slave.

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:19.107
- Yeah, but if he wins -
- Got any smack?

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.651
No, but how much you want?

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:25.154
- The minimum, l guess.
- 5,000 pesetas?

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.781
All right.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.784
Wait here.
l'll go get it.

01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:48.094
l'm gonna sit down over there.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.564
Wanna bang me
for 5,000 pesetas?

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:02.400
Me give you 5,000?
No way.

01:12:02.526 --> 01:12:05.653
Then 4,000,
what with the herpes and all.

01:12:05.779 --> 01:12:09.782
lt's not the money.
lf l had to pay every time, hell!

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:13.619
And my girl's at home with a toothache.
l can't be screwing around.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:15.538
What's that got to do with it?

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:19.500
That's the guy
who attacked me that night.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:21.377
The guy who had a mustache?

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.005
He doesn't have one now.
l'll check it out.

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:27.342
- You're crazy!
- Maybe, but l won't pay.

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:30.345
- So we meet again?
- l don't know you.

01:12:30.554 --> 01:12:33.723
Don't you?
You roughed me up the other night!

01:12:36.977 --> 01:12:38.394
Let's go.

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:40.581
l told you l'd kill you.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.254
- What did you find?
- Subway tickets.

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:49.382
- 5,000 pesetas.
- Toothpicks. Give me the money.

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:51.926
- We split it.
- Like hell! He robbed me.

01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:53.511
No way.

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:56.806
Take his jacket.
Or you could fuck him.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:59.434
- l'd rather have his boots.
- Sold.

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.394
Give me the cash.
- What about me?

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.105
- You enjoyed it, you sadist.
- That's true.

01:14:57.868 --> 01:14:59.911
What happened to you?

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:03.080
l got attacked.
They took everything.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.833
Even your boots!

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.752
Why?

01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:10.379
l'm sorry.
l couldn't get your stuff.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.798
Leave it.
l'll do it myself.

01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:31.234
Let me help you.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.504
Those animals!

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.270
- This reminds me of my parents.
- What?

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:11.899
My mom used to shave my dad
on the patio back home.

01:16:12.859 --> 01:16:15.236
lt's all l remember
about them.

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:36.048
- Does it hurt?
- Not at all.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.107
Jeez, what l had to go through!

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.742
l don't know
where to put my hands.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:04.118
Wait a minute.

01:17:04.369 --> 01:17:05.661
- Listen.
- What?

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:08.873
- You sure it's all right?
- Positive.

01:17:09.249 --> 01:17:12.293
- We can stop if you want.
- You crazy?

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:17.006
The only thing the bastards
didn't touch was my cock.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.966
l'll put it inside.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:17.817
Don't pull out.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.699
- Now l remember.
- What?

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:27.159
l remember you now.

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:30.037
l don't follow.

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:35.418
You said we'd screwed before,
and l said l didn't remember.

01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:38.254
Well, now l remember perfectly.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:40.506
l thought it was odd.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:48.222
- Let's change position.
- How?

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.725
Don't move. Don't pull out.

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.771
- Does it hurt?
- l don't know.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.108
Hold on.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:08.826
Don't come.

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:22.047
Don't laugh or it'll slip out.

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:36.312
Wait, don't move.
Don't pull out.

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.397
Don't pull out.

01:20:00.337 --> 01:20:03.339
- l didn't want to wake you.
- What are you doing?

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:06.467
- l drew you a map of my life.
- Show me.

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:08.093
Look.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:11.472
lmagine my life's a subway line.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.769
First stop:
orphaned at three.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:18.229
Orphanage.

01:20:18.438 --> 01:20:22.441
Escaped when l was eight.
Reformatory. More escapes.

01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:24.527
Mental hospital at 1 6.

01:20:24.694 --> 01:20:26.654
What a career!

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:29.114
l learned lots of trades there.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:32.326
Locksmith was my favorite -
breaking in and out.

01:20:32.452 --> 01:20:35.538
So l'd escape now and then,
but l always went back.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:36.872
Why?

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:40.709
l had nowhere to go,
and the director lady liked me.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:43.754
That's why
you're such a good lay.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.507
- With them it was different.
- Were there lots of directors?

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.177
No, only one director.
The others were nurses.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.471
Now l understand.

01:20:52.889 --> 01:20:54.181
Go on.

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:59.228
Last year l escaped
and met you.

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:01.856
That stop changed my life.

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:04.024
You were all l could think of,

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:08.362
and thinking took up all my time,
so l stopped acting crazy.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:13.617
A judge came along,
gave me a test, and said l was fine.

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:15.995
They let me go.

01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:18.289
End of the line.

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.376
- You.
- Me.

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:35.139
l can't leave her
hanging there.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:39.059
We need to shoot
another scene. Or two.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:42.354
Someone find Marina, please.

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.566
lf it's a question of money,
l'll pay.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.193
- What with?
- Money's not the problem.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.196
Maximo,
everything has a limit.

01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:53.616
Perfection is my only limit.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:58.078
Must l remind you
of your duty as director?

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:02.124
My duty is to warn you
that the film has no ending!

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.918
Just add "The End."

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.212
l won't discuss it any further!

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.298
You're going too far.

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.884
We have to talk.
Meet me in the bar.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:14.345
Okay.
Can you grab these?

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:16.805
Where's your sister?
Why won't she answer?

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:19.099
l don't know.
l'll see what Antonio wants.

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:22.561
Sure, or he might not use you
on his next film!

01:22:22.687 --> 01:22:26.106
lf it's with you,
l'd rather direct traffic!

01:22:26.232 --> 01:22:28.233
That's enough, Maximo!

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.863
- What's he got against me?
- lt's not you.

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:37.242
He doesn't want to finish the film
because he knows it's his last.

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:39.995
l know he's unbearable.
- l'll say.

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:42.498
lt's his way
of fighting off death.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:46.043
Tell Marina
to at least call him.

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:48.629
- Marina's disappeared.
- What?

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:51.966
l haven't seen her since
the last day of shooting.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:54.969
- You two spoke that night.
- l lied to you.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.971
Did you call the police?

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:59.848
No, the police and us -
l prefer not to.

01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:01.475
l see.

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:13.779
Do something.
Set the table.

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:15.656
Okay.

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:22.663
Look.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.916
Here's Granadilla,
my home town.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:27.876
Not far from Plasencia.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.170
l'll steal a car tonight
and we're off.

01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:34.508
- With your face like that?
- You don't want to go?

01:23:34.634 --> 01:23:36.802
Not in a stolen car, l don't.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:40.431
Then we'll go by train or bus.
But we're going.

01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:46.603
Your pain's gone, right?

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:51.108
- My whole body hurts.
- Then we'll go tomorrow.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.960
lsn't that your doorbell?

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.928
You knew! That's why
you didn't want to leave!

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:05.099
- l swear l didn't!
- You tricked me, you whore!

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:09.478
Don't hit me! How could l know
she had the keys?

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:14.191
You talked to the guy!
He told you to give her his mail!

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:17.194
- Don't hurt Lola!
- Shut up!

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:31.875
l'll be right down!

01:25:32.001 --> 01:25:33.961
l've been waiting an hour!

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:36.296
l heard you, asshole!

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.269
She's gone.

01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:05.200
There's no need to shout.

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:09.246
lt was ten minutes max.
l have lots to do!

01:26:09.372 --> 01:26:12.166
- Just move your fucking car.
- Watch your language!

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.876
Come on!

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:15.961
Hey, hands off my car!

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:19.131
- l'll burn it!
- l'll tell you what you can burn!

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:21.175
Rude man!

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:24.178
l won't say
what l think of you.

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:25.596
Misogynist!

01:26:38.943 --> 01:26:41.403
We have to go.
We can't wait any longer.

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:44.323
- Whatever you say.
- l'll go steal a car.

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:47.367
- l have a little money.
- We'll need it.

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:50.204
But we also need a car.
- Okay.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.041
Will you wait for me here?

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.502
Will you run away
if l don't tie you up?

01:26:57.629 --> 01:27:00.547
l don't know.
You'd better tie me up.

01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:07.721
Tie me up.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.962
This is the last time
l tie you up.

01:28:36.894 --> 01:28:39.896
Shit! l forgot
the damn radio again!

01:29:15.808 --> 01:29:17.351
There it is.

01:29:18.811 --> 01:29:20.937
l'm about to pee
in my pants.

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:43.210
That's odd.

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:12.697
Pepe, are you in there?

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.410
Lola, come in.

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:23.333
- What happened?
- l was kidnapped. Untie me.

01:30:23.876 --> 01:30:27.295
- Kidnapped? Where? Here?
- And at my place.

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:31.383
- By whom?
- Later. He'll be back any minute.

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:34.094
The kidnapper?
Let's go!

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.721
You look awful.
You been taking dope?

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:38.598
l'll get my purse.

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:43.562
What's all this blood?
l'm responsible for this place!

01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:56.658
- My Walkman!
- Leave it.

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:59.286
l'll buy you a new one.

01:31:00.079 --> 01:31:02.330
l don't get it.
What's going on?

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:05.375
- l love him.
- What?

01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:09.546
- l love him.
- The guy who kidnapped you?

01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:10.922
You're crazy!

01:31:11.048 --> 01:31:14.217
How can you love a kidnapper
who ties you up?

01:31:14.343 --> 01:31:16.261
You think that's normal?

01:31:16.387 --> 01:31:19.764
lt must be the shock.
You can't be that kinky!

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:23.977
We'll go over the roof
and out the other street.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.187
Come on!

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.977
Let's go!

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:37.008
Hurry! Get in!

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:46.393
The Granadilla-Marina line.

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:57.404
How are you doing?

01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:58.780
Fine.

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:01.658
l brought you a sleeping pill.

01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:04.119
- Thanks, Lola.
- Now...

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:07.372
tell me all about it.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.959
Don't you trust your sis?

01:33:12.378 --> 01:33:14.379
lt's hard to explain.

01:33:14.505 --> 01:33:17.048
Start with how
he kidnapped you.

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:19.926
lt was the night of the party.

01:33:20.553 --> 01:33:23.597
l'd been at the door
saying good-bye to Pepe.

01:33:23.723 --> 01:33:27.142
lt rang again so l opened it,
thinking it was him.

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:30.395
- You shouldn't have.
- Yeah, well, anyway...

01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:34.107
l started screaming, and Ricki hit me.
- How terrible!

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:37.819
- He just meant to shut me up.
- Sure!

01:33:39.238 --> 01:33:41.114
When l came to...

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.867
he explained
that he'd kidnapped me

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:46.244
so l could get to know him.

01:33:47.913 --> 01:33:51.291
He said, "l'm 23 years old,
l have 50,000 pesetas...

01:33:52.084 --> 01:33:54.127
and l'm all alone in the world.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:57.422
l hope to be
a good husband to you

01:33:57.673 --> 01:34:00.091
and a good father
to your kids."

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:02.510
What a mess.

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:43.862
He can't hear you.
You go up alone.

01:36:07.344 --> 01:36:09.262
You came!

01:36:09.388 --> 01:36:13.057
With my sister. She wants us
to live with the family.

01:36:13.184 --> 01:36:16.519
- Your family?
- And yours from now on, if you want.

01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:21.983
Come on.

01:36:25.988 --> 01:36:27.864
Lola, this is Ricki.

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:32.619
- This is yours.
- Thanks. Anything else?

01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:38.458
ls that everything?
- No, hold on.

01:36:39.084 --> 01:36:41.461
l'm sorry about all this.
- So am l.

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:44.798
Don't let it happen again.
Mind sitting in the back?

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:47.509
What about your car?
- lt's stolen.

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:50.678
l thought so.
Well, someone will take it.

01:36:50.888 --> 01:36:54.015
By the way, there's never
been a thief in my family.

01:36:54.225 --> 01:36:57.143
What about Dad?
May he rest in peace...

01:36:57.394 --> 01:36:59.938
Exactly!
One was enough!

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:02.690
Marina says
you're a good locksmith.

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:04.818
And plumber and carpenter -

01:37:05.027 --> 01:37:07.695
- And electrician and bricklayer.
- Great.

01:37:07.905 --> 01:37:09.989
l'll find you work
within a week.

01:37:10.199 --> 01:37:12.867
l assume
you don't mind working?

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:15.286
- No, l want to work.
- Good.

01:37:15.579 --> 01:37:17.914
One more thing.
When we get home,

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.542
not a word about
the kidnapping to my mother.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:22.502
Don't worry.

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:24.712
ls the interrogation over?

01:37:25.256 --> 01:37:26.673
Yes.

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:29.843
Now give me a kiss.
l'm not that bad.

01:37:30.469 --> 01:37:33.012
lt's just that you two
put me through hell!

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.306
Let's have some music.

01:37:58.664 --> 01:38:02.000
When l lose every game

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:06.754
When loneliness
is my only bedmate

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:11.759
When l find
there's no way out

01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:16.389
And night gives me no rest

01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:21.394
When the silence
frightens me

01:38:22.855 --> 01:38:26.316
When l can't stand
on my own two feet

01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:31.279
When memories rise up

01:38:32.531 --> 01:38:35.575
And pin me to the wall

01:38:36.452 --> 01:38:38.536
l will hold on

01:38:38.662 --> 01:38:40.747
And go on living

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:46.002
l'll turn to steel
so nothing can get through

01:38:46.211 --> 01:38:50.423
And though the winds of life
blow hard around me

01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:55.845
I'II be Iike the reed
that bends but never breaks

01:38:56.055 --> 01:38:57.555
l will hold on...

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:02.435
What is it, silly?

01:39:03.395 --> 01:39:05.730
We get along just fine!

01:39:05.981 --> 01:39:07.774
Come on, sweetie.
