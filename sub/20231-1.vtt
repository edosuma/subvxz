WEBVTT

01:35.596 --> 01:36.597
MR. ASBY.

01:39.057 --> 01:39.808
IT'S ME, JESSE.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.893
JUST, UH, GO ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.323
Asby: <i>Hello?</i>

03:19.116 --> 03:20.200
<i>Hello?</i>

03:21.326 --> 03:22.326
<i>John?</i>

03:23.078 --> 03:24.079
<i>John?</i>

03:25.163 --> 03:26.498
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

03:27.874 --> 03:29.000
<i>John!</i>

03:29.835 --> 03:31.545
<i>What's the matter?
John!</i>

03:33.171 --> 03:34.715
<i>Answer me... John!</i>

03:35.298 --> 03:36.508
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:40.345
<i>John, are you there?</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:41.722
YEAH.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.807
I GOTTA SEE YOU.

03:45.100 --> 03:45.934
IS THIS CAL?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.102
<i>It's me.</i>

03:49.271 --> 03:50.397
IT'S YOUR BROTHER.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.733
DOES HE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

03:52.858 --> 03:54.109
MNH-MNH.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.071
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING, MAN?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.031
I'M AT THE OFFICE.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.033
<i>That's your problem, baby.</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:03.285
WHERE YOU BEEN ALL DAY?

04:03.702 --> 04:04.786
AROUND.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.997
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

04:07.622 --> 04:11.418
I PUT $5,000 IN YOUR BANK
ACCOUNT THIS AFTERNOON...

04:11.668 --> 04:12.794
PAYMENT IN ADVANCE.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.171
FOR WHAT?

04:14.838 --> 04:17.048
<i>Pick me up... now.</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:19.341
<i>I'm in deep trouble.</i>

04:20.302 --> 04:21.636
WHAT'S UP?

04:22.304 --> 04:23.972
GET HERE... FAST,

04:24.514 --> 04:26.475
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN I SEE YOU.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.602
YEAH, OKAY.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.438
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH
MY SISTER ARNA...

04:31.646 --> 04:32.647
GOT TO WARN HER.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.232
<i>Have you heard from her?</i>

04:34.900 --> 04:36.651
I THINK I CAN PUT
A HAND ON HER.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.615
IF YOU CAN REACH HER,
TELL HER TO GET HOME,

04:41.865 --> 04:43.700
KEEP THE DOORS LOCKED
TILL WE GET THERE.

04:44.868 --> 04:45.952
YEAH, OKAY.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.052
NOW, LOOK HERE.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.874
THAT MAN'S TROUBLE!
HE'S BEEN TO MY HOUSE!

07:34.037 --> 07:36.289
HE'LL PUT A HOLE
IN YOUR SOUL, HONEY!

09:29.611 --> 09:31.946
CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ARE
ANY OTHER BODIES INSIDE.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.335
LOOKS LIKE CAL ASBY TO ME.
WHAT'S HE LOOK LIKE TO YOU?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.837
WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.091
MAYBE YOU TWO HAD
A LITTLE CONVERSATION

09:51.216 --> 09:52.216
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.054
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU, SHAFT?

09:56.513 --> 09:58.139
"STAY AWAY
FROM BLACK HONKIES

09:58.264 --> 10:00.600
WITH BIG, FLAT FEET."

10:18.326 --> 10:20.537
LOOK LIKE THERE'S
ONLY ONE DEAD, CAPTAIN.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.324
I WAS HOPING MAYBE <i>YOU</i> COULD
SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.376
HE NEVER HURT ANYONE
IN HIS LIFE.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.212
HE LOVED THIS COMMUNITY,

11:11.379 --> 11:13.298
AND EVERYBODY HERE
LOVED HIM.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.592
HE WAS PLANNING
TO BREAK GROUND

11:15.675 --> 11:18.261
FOR THAT CHILDCARE CLINIC
OVER IN HARLEM

11:18.386 --> 11:20.013
SOMETIME NEXT MONTH.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.099
BUT NOW...

11:24.100 --> 11:25.351
AND HOW DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

11:26.060 --> 11:29.397
WITH HIM... ALL THE WAY.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.524
DON'T SHIT ME, KELLY.

11:32.859 --> 11:33.979
YOU FOUGHT HIM
TOOTH AND NAIL

11:34.027 --> 11:35.904
ABOUT LAYING BREAD
ON THAT GHETTO CLINIC.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.471
HEY, UM, FELLAS...

12:02.430 --> 12:04.057
HELP ME MOVE THIS NEXT DOOR.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.309
AFTER ALL,
I CAN'T LEAVE IT HERE.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.811
OKAY?

12:16.653 --> 12:18.321
YEAH, RIGHT THERE IS FINE.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.823
THANKS A LOT.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.176
WOULD YOU, UH,
CLOSE THE DOOR

12:22.200 --> 12:23.409
ON YOUR WAY OUT, PLEASE?

14:24.447 --> 14:25.698
AHHH.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.036
WELL, LISTEN,
BEFORE I FORGET...

14:31.162 --> 14:34.040
HAVE JACK CHECK THOSE TWO
FRONT DOORS ON THE CHOPPER.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.459
WHAT THE HELL YOU GOT
THE IDIOT THERE FOR, ANYWAY?

14:37.335 --> 14:38.127
BECAUSE HE'S THE BEST.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.129
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'VE GOT HIM THERE FOR?

15:49.532 --> 15:51.325
SORRY, GUS.
I'LL GO USE THE PHONE...

15:51.451 --> 15:52.660
IN THE BEDROOM.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.140
KELLY SAYS THE SAFE'S EMPTY.

16:58.100 --> 16:58.768
GUS!

16:58.935 --> 17:00.269
DO YOU HEAR ME?

17:00.978 --> 17:03.022
<i>KELLY SAID THE SAFE'S EMPTY.</i>

17:19.622 --> 17:20.623
POUR.

17:23.960 --> 17:24.794
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

17:24.919 --> 17:27.128
HOW KELLY SAYS
THE SAFE IS EMPTY.

17:28.548 --> 17:33.386
DID YOU ASK MR. KELLY
TO POP... BY?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.012
YES.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.766
I TOLD HIM IF HE DIDN'T HAVE
THE $250,000,

17:38.891 --> 17:40.768
I'D PERSONALLY HAVE HIS ASS.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.397
POSSIBLY MR. KELLY NEEDS
A LITTLE MORE TIME, HMM?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.857
YOU SHOULDN'T CROWD
PEOPLE, ANDY.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.192
IT'S NOT COOL.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.320
YOU, UH, GOT TO GIVE A MAN
A LITTLE ELBOW ROOM.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.863
YEAH, I'LL GIVE HIM
ELBOW ROOM...

17:53.030 --> 17:54.365
BLACK SON OF A BITCH!

17:54.490 --> 17:56.576
UNH-UNH-UNH-UNH-UNH.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.412
YOU HAVE A TENDENCY
TO OVERREACT, ANDREW.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.665
YOU SEE, MR. KELLY MEANS

18:02.790 --> 18:05.167
NOT ONLY THE QUARTER OF
A MILLION DOLLARS HE OWES ME.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.588
BUT REMEMBER...
HE'S GOT THE KEY TO QUEENS.

18:10.715 --> 18:11.924
RELAX.

18:12.883 --> 18:13.968
RELAX.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.332
I DON'T WANT TOO MANY BOYS
HANGING AROUND.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.708
THEY WON'T BE THERE.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.460
ALL RIGHT.
MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT THERE.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.878
WHAT ARE YOU WUSSES
DOING HERE?

20:13.170 --> 20:14.505
WELL, WELL.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.133
YOU GO TO A LOT
OF FUNERALS, SHAFT.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.592
WILLY AND ME,

20:19.135 --> 20:21.429
ONE DAY
WE'LL DROP IN ON YOURS.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.139
REAL SOON.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.223
YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.016
<i>IN THAT CASE,</i>

20:26.142 --> 20:28.602
WE'LL SEND YOU A WREATH...
WITH LOVE.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.438
HEH HEH HEH.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.944
WHAT ABOUT ASBY
AND THOSE NUMBERS?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.363
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THAT BUSINESS?

20:39.488 --> 20:40.698
AIN'T OUR WAR, WILLY.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.951
KELLY'S IN CHARGE NOW.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.620
WE GOT ENOUGH TROUBLES
OF OUR OWN.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.575
OH, MY GOD.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.911
OH, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?!

21:45.429 --> 21:46.429
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.555
YEAH.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.037
AAAH!

22:21.298 --> 22:23.384
RIGHT ON TIME, MR. KELLY.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.136
JUST TRYING TO HELP, MAN.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.472
YEAH, RIGHT.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.017
LOOK, DO ME A FAVOR...

22:32.768 --> 22:33.936
IF YOU GET A MOMENT,

22:34.103 --> 22:36.272
LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE
PARTNERSHIP PAPERS, OKAY?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.355
OKAY.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.550
I WANNA THANK YOU FOR
BEING SO HELPFUL, MR. KELLY.

23:05.259 --> 23:08.053
AT A TIME LIKE THIS, JOHN,
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.824
ARNA TELLS ME
YOU'RE GONNA BE HANDLING

23:10.848 --> 23:11.932
HER END OF THE BUSINESS.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.768
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS
TO THAT, DO YOU?

23:15.644 --> 23:16.937
NO, NO.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.833
FACT IS, I FIGURED SINCE YOU'RE
IN SUCH A BEREAVED STATE,

23:19.857 --> 23:22.359
I MIGHT HANG AROUND
AND KINDA HELP YOU OUT.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.462
WHO KNOWS?
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,

23:24.486 --> 23:27.489
<i>MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHO KNOCKED OFF CAL.</i>

23:43.213 --> 23:44.298
SHAFT.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.424
YEP.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.969
LATELY
WE SEEM TO BE TRAVELING

23:49.094 --> 23:50.304
IN THE SAME CIRCLES...

23:50.804 --> 23:54.308
BOMBINGS, FUNERALS,
AND HOUSES OF THE DECEASED.

23:56.644 --> 23:57.895
SAD CIRCLES.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.108
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE PRECINCT
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

24:01.857 --> 24:02.857
OKAY, BABY.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.068
GET IN THE VEHICLE.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.488
I GOT MY OWN SHORT.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.031
<i>I'LL FOLLOW YOU.</i>

24:10.658 --> 24:11.658
OKAY.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.428
COME ON, COME ON!

25:14.221 --> 25:15.573
Captain: WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

25:15.597 --> 25:16.890
CHIEF... HEY, CHIEF,

25:17.016 --> 25:18.183
GET THIS BASTARD
OFF MY BACK.

25:18.267 --> 25:19.685
YOU LITTLE SON OF A BITCH!

25:20.102 --> 25:21.186
TELL HIM I GOT RIGHTS!

25:22.271 --> 25:23.271
WHAT DID HE DO?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.324
THE DELI ON NORTHERN BOULEVARD
FOR 300 BUCKS,

25:25.441 --> 25:27.026
A GAS STATION FOR 27,

25:27.151 --> 25:29.403
THEN HE RAN A STOLEN CHEVY
INTO THE SIDE OF A SQUAD CAR!

25:29.862 --> 25:30.862
I GOT RIGHTS!

25:31.530 --> 25:33.198
FUCK YOUR RIGHTS.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.825
GO SUE THE CITY.

25:35.409 --> 25:36.409
COME ON.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.372
COME ON.
COME ON, KID.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.000
RELAX, HUH?

25:44.918 --> 25:47.379
DON'T YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING
TO REHABILITATE YOU HERE?

25:47.504 --> 25:48.714
SHIT.

25:58.766 --> 25:59.516
NOW, YOU LOOK...

25:59.641 --> 26:01.268
YOU TRY ANY OF THAT SHIT
ON ME,

26:01.685 --> 26:03.729
AND NONE OF US
WILL WALK OUT OF THIS ROOM!

26:04.396 --> 26:05.564
COME ON, SHAFT.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.068
<i>SIT DOWN, SHAFT.</i>

26:11.403 --> 26:12.237
I'LL SIT WHEN I'M SURE

26:12.362 --> 26:13.864
THAT APE WILL STAY
IN HIS CAGE.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.575
NOW, WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT WITH ME?

26:17.117 --> 26:19.536
WHAT ARE YOU INTO WITH
CAL ASBY AND JOHNNY KELLY?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.164
I WAS INTO A FUNERAL
FOR AN OLD FRIEND.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.918
HOW'S THAT ANY BUSINESS
OF YOURS?

26:26.043 --> 26:29.004
IT'S BEEN THE BUSINESS
OF EVERY MAN IN THIS BUILDING

26:29.379 --> 26:30.881
EVER SINCE
ASBY AND KELLY SET UP

26:31.006 --> 26:32.758
A NUMBERS RACKET IN QUEENS.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.136
WHAT'S YOUR CONNECTION
WITH IT?

26:36.470 --> 26:37.930
WHAT'S WRONG WITH NUMBERS?

26:38.889 --> 26:40.516
A MAN NEEDS A LITTLE ACTION.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.519
LOOK, YOU GOT OFF-TRACK BETTING
HERE IN NEW YORK,

26:44.019 --> 26:45.604
<i>GOT A LOTTERY SYSTEM
ALL OVER THE WORLD.</i>

26:46.438 --> 26:48.357
EVERYBODY NEEDS A LONG SHOT.

26:48.732 --> 26:49.983
NOW, AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
CAPTAIN?

26:50.359 --> 26:51.568
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME THROW UP

26:51.693 --> 26:53.612
IF YOU KEEP LECTURING ME
ON THE PSYCHO-DYNAMICS

26:53.737 --> 26:55.864
<i>OF WHAT PEOPLE NEED.</i>

26:59.118 --> 27:01.453
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.

27:03.038 --> 27:06.083
WELL, NOW, I'M GLAD
YOU CLUED ME IN, CAPTAIN.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.131
GET US SOME COFFEE, COOPER.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.967
YOU TALKING TO ME, CAPTAIN?

27:15.092 --> 27:16.593
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, SING?

27:17.302 --> 27:18.303
GET THE COFFEE, MAN.

27:25.519 --> 27:26.519
MAKE MINE BLACK.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.696
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT
TO COOPER.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.450
SOMETHING JUST CAME OVER ME,
CAPTAIN.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.787
I'M REALLY ASHAMED.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.210
TELL YOU WHAT I GOT,
SHAFT...

27:52.880 --> 27:54.590
YOU JIVIN' ASBY'S SISTER,

27:55.966 --> 27:57.676
HE CATCHES A BOMB,

27:58.552 --> 27:59.761
AND KELLY TAKES OVER.

28:02.347 --> 28:05.058
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU TWO
GOT IT BRACKETED.

28:06.602 --> 28:09.271
AND NOW YOU FIGURE
TO RUN THE NUMBERS IN QUEENS.

28:09.938 --> 28:10.938
LIKE THAT SO FAR?

28:13.942 --> 28:14.942
RAP ON.

28:16.111 --> 28:19.531
AND AT THE FUNERAL,
WHO DO I SEE YOU WITH?

28:19.865 --> 28:20.865
BUMPY.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.121
AND YOU FIGURE
I'M BRINGING BUMPY IN.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.664
WHY NOT?

28:29.958 --> 28:32.753
YOU FINGER ASBY
AND BRING IN BUMPY?

28:35.464 --> 28:38.175
YOU PRIVATE SHITS
WILL DO ANYTHING FOR A BUCK.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.636
YOU PULL HARLEM AND QUEENS
TOGETHER,

28:40.761 --> 28:42.304
AND HELL, MAN, YOU'RE FAT.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.432
DO YOU JUST SIT AROUND
AND THINK THESE THINGS UP,

28:45.599 --> 28:48.101
OR DO THEY JUST COME TO YOU
IN A FLASH?

28:51.730 --> 28:54.024
HOW COME WE NEVER HASSLED
CAL ASBY?

28:55.067 --> 28:56.068
GO AHEAD... ASK ME.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.504
YOU NEVER HASSLED HIM
'CAUSE HE'S PROBABLY LAYING

28:58.528 --> 29:01.365
SOME HEAVY BREAD ON YOU GUYS
EVERY MONTH AT THE PRECINCT.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.703
HE RAN A WHEEL, OKAY.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.289
POOR MAN'S RACETRACK,

29:09.414 --> 29:11.541
BUT, MAN,
YOU CAN'T CUT <i>THAT</i> OUT.

29:14.002 --> 29:19.508
BUT HE DIDN'T DEAL IN SHIT
OR WHORES OR LOANSHARKING.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.468
<i>EVERYTHING WAS COOL.</i>

29:24.429 --> 29:28.725
AND NOW, WITH ASBY DEAD
AND KELLY RUNNING THINGS,

29:29.101 --> 29:30.310
WHO KNOWS?

29:31.436 --> 29:33.897
ANYBODY CAN MOVE
INTO THE VACUUM...

29:34.982 --> 29:39.695
MAYBE YOUR PAL BUMPY,
OR MASCOLA FROM DOWNTOWN.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.321
OH, YOU'VE HEARD OF MASCOLA?

29:42.906 --> 29:43.906
YEP.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.535
DOES A LOT OF TV WORK...

29:46.660 --> 29:49.204
EVERY TIME A SENATE
CRIME COMMITTEE IS IN TOWN.

29:55.085 --> 29:56.169
THREE SUGARS...

29:59.172 --> 30:00.257
...WITH CREAM.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.177
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, CAPTAIN?

30:04.303 --> 30:05.637
PUT THE WORD OUT...

30:06.013 --> 30:07.389
NOBODY BETTER TRY
TO COME IN HERE

30:07.514 --> 30:09.182
AND MESS UP THE STATUS QUO.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.395
AND NOBODY'S COMING IN HERE
TO SELL SHIT TO OUR KIDS

30:13.478 --> 30:15.022
OR PUT WHORES
ON OUR STREETS.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.733
IS THIS PROGRAM
BEING RECORDED,

30:17.858 --> 30:19.401
OR ARE WE GOING OUT LIVE?

30:20.944 --> 30:22.112
LOOK, MAN...

30:23.071 --> 30:25.198
I CAN COOL YOU OFF
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.159
WE HAVE A NICE STEEL PAD
BACK THERE.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.662
OKAY. LET'S GO.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.841
BUT I CAN'T BE ANY HELP
TO ANYONE IN A STEEL PAD.

30:50.432 --> 30:53.185
OKAY, SHAFT...
ON THE STREET.

30:54.603 --> 30:55.937
<i>BUT IF YOU'RE SMART,</i>

30:58.148 --> 30:59.441
YOU'LL KEEP IN TOUCH.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.169
ASBY-KELLY MAN.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.633
SANTA CLAUS.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.551
YOU HAVE HIT THE NUMBER,
BROTHER.

31:27.803 --> 31:28.803
COUNT IT.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.558
THANK YOU, BROTHER.
SAME THING TOMORROW, RIGHT?

31:33.642 --> 31:35.060
OKAY.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.606
ASBY-KELLY MAN.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.736
ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.

31:52.702 --> 31:55.163
802 IS THE FIGURE
FOR TODAY, BROTHER.

31:56.623 --> 32:00.252
SEE, THAT'S $3 ON
YOUR WIFE'S BURIAL POLICY...

32:01.586 --> 32:05.549
$1.50 ON YOURS, AND, UH...

32:05.841 --> 32:08.093
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS 717.

32:08.218 --> 32:11.471
717 FOR 50 CENTS.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.390
THANK YOU, BROTHER.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.901
OH, SHHH...

32:35.120 --> 32:36.204
UGH!

32:38.457 --> 32:40.500
HEY, MAN, PLEASE, MAN,
D-D-DON'T SHOOT ME.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.836
HEY, LOOK, MAN,
TAKE THE MONEY.

32:43.003 --> 32:46.173
I GOT A WIFE AND SIX KIDS
AND AN OLD BUICK TO SUPPORT.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.300
YOU WON'T GET HURT
LONG AS YOU KEEP TALKING.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.385
NOW, WHERE'S KELLY
OPERATING OUT OF?

32:50.552 --> 32:51.428
HEY, MAN, I CAN'T...

32:52.596 --> 32:54.222
HEY, PLEASE, BROTHER,
TAKE THE MONEY.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.932
LOOK, MAN,
I'M JUST A RUNNER, MAN.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.057
WHERE?!

32:57.100 --> 32:58.935
HEY, BROTHER, I CAN'T.
KELLY'S GONNA KILL ME.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.270
I SAID, "WHERE?!"

33:00.520 --> 33:04.065
Woman:

33:15.535 --> 33:16.578
Kelly: <i>SHUT UP!</i>

33:28.757 --> 33:31.635
YOU USED TO SAY
I HAD AN OPERATIC VOICE.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.179
YOU WERE GONNA GIVE ME
VOICE LESSONS.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.223
<i>JUST KNOCK IT OFF.</i>

33:38.099 --> 33:39.684
NO DAMN FLUID.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.395
MAYBE IT'S THE WICK.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.857
IT'S THE WICKS
THAT ALWAYS GO FIRST.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.236
BITCH.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.574
YOU GONNA HANG AROUND HERE
ALL DAY AND SHAKE?

33:54.699 --> 33:55.699
LISTEN!

33:57.452 --> 33:59.496
HERE, <i>I</i> PAY THE RENT.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.289
IF I WANNA HANG AROUND
ALL DAY,

34:01.414 --> 34:02.499
<i>THAT'S MY BUSINESS.</i>

34:02.624 --> 34:04.709
YOU THINK I NEED YOU.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.713
I DON'T SEE YOU PACKING.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.882
JUST WATCH!

34:19.808 --> 34:21.268
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

34:21.393 --> 34:22.435
YOU BETTER NOT!

34:24.771 --> 34:26.565
THAT'S JUST FOR OPENERS.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.491
BITCH!

34:37.909 --> 34:38.909
YEAH?

34:39.411 --> 34:40.704
SO?

34:41.246 --> 34:42.539
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

34:43.290 --> 34:44.456
IT'S ANOTHER DAY GONE BY,

34:44.583 --> 34:46.543
AND WE'RE GETTING NOTHING
BUT WEATHER REPORTS.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.004
EASY ON MR. KELLY, NOW.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.297
LOOK, MAN, I NEED MORE TIME.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.384
YOU HAVE A FRIEND IN COURT.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.387
THE MAN SAYS
TO GO EASY ON YOU.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.740
YOU MIGHT SUGGEST
IF HE'S IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

34:59.764 --> 35:02.601
HE STOP BY, AND WE, UH,
HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.313
THE BOSS SAYS
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,

35:06.688 --> 35:09.274
I'D GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE
RIGHT NOW.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.651
NO CLASS...

35:11.985 --> 35:13.737
SIMPLY NO CLASS.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.162
I'LL SEE YOU
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.040
RITA! I SAID I'LL SEE YOU
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.793
MAKE IT A COUPLE OF YEARS.

36:29.771 --> 36:30.563
YES?

36:30.730 --> 36:31.856
Shaft: <i>IS KELLY THERE?</i>

36:33.233 --> 36:35.819
WE DON'T GIVE OUT
THAT KIND OF INFORMATION.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.029
<i>TELL KELLY
THAT JOHN SHAFT WANTS HIM.</i>

36:39.531 --> 36:41.571
<i>AND IF HE'S NOT IN MY OFFICE
BY 5:00 THIS AFTERNOON,</i>

36:41.616 --> 36:44.077
<i>I'M COMING BACK HERE AND TAKING
THIS DOOR OFF THE HINGES.</i>

36:48.707 --> 36:50.625
WHY WAIT TILL 5:00?

36:52.460 --> 36:54.713
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT
A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.215
NOT ANYMORE, I'M NOT...

36:59.134 --> 37:02.595
NOT AFTER THIS NASTY SLAP
IN THE FACE.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.974
BEST THING FOR THAT
IS AN ICE PACK.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.103
WHY, THANK YOU, MR. SHAFT.

37:10.979 --> 37:14.232
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN
AND SHOW ME HOW TO APPLY IT?

37:21.197 --> 37:22.323
ON SECOND THOUGHT...

37:24.200 --> 37:25.368
NO ICE.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.164
YOU MIGHT CATCH COLD.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.502
I SUPPOSE
IT'S IMMODEST OF ME

37:34.669 --> 37:37.255
TO WALK AROUND LIKE THIS
IN FRONT OF A STRANGER.

37:40.008 --> 37:42.469
BUT ANY ENEMY
OF JOHN KELLY'S

37:42.594 --> 37:44.471
IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

37:50.977 --> 37:51.977
FUNNY...

37:53.938 --> 37:55.398
I USED TO LOVE THE GUY.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.235
UH, WHEN DO YOU
EXPECT HIM BACK?

37:59.569 --> 38:01.237
I HOPE NEVER.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.158
SO, WHAT AM I DOING
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

38:05.658 --> 38:07.202
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

38:11.039 --> 38:12.499
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR THINGS OFF?

38:24.469 --> 38:25.470
HEY...

38:26.221 --> 38:27.305
<i>WAIT A MINUTE.</i>

38:29.390 --> 38:31.017
I DIDN'T MEAN ALL <i>THAT.</i>

38:31.601 --> 38:33.645
HEY, BABY, LOOK,
IT'S HOT IN HERE.

38:34.229 --> 38:37.315
BESIDES, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL... OVERDRESSED.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.755
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHERE WE FOUND IT.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.090
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU

39:02.215 --> 39:03.633
NOT TO FRISK OUR GUESTS,
ANDY?

39:03.758 --> 39:05.301
MR. KELLY IS NO HOODLUM.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.304
YOU'RE SITTING ON MY TABLE,
MR. KELLY.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.599
<i>THAT'S BETTER.</i>

39:13.142 --> 39:13.935
TSK, TSK, TSK, TSK.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.645
NOW, I THOUGHT
THIS WAS GOING TO BE

39:15.728 --> 39:18.022
A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION.

39:18.231 --> 39:20.608
BEEN CARRYING THAT PIECE
SINCE I WAS 10 YEARS OLD.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.404
A LOUSY .25 CALIBER.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.948
ALWAYS FIGURED
HE WAS A FAGGOT.

39:30.660 --> 39:31.660
WATCH IT.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.081
NOW, MR. KELLY,

39:36.082 --> 39:37.834
YOU BRING ME
UP TO THE MOMENT

39:38.001 --> 39:39.127
ON OUR SITUATION.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.213
IT'S NOT GOOD, GUS.
IT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.007
HOW SO, MR. KELLY?

39:44.090 --> 39:46.467
PASCAL, GIVE ME
THE PASTA, HMM?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.766
HE HAD THE MONEY
IN THE SAFE.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.393
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

39:55.727 --> 39:58.438
HE SIGNED THE PAPERS.
HE WAS BUYING ME OUT...

39:58.605 --> 39:59.689
IN CASH.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.443
I HAD A COUPLE
OF MY BOYS OUTSIDE.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.654
THEY SAW HIM TAKE
A SHOPPING BAG

40:06.905 --> 40:08.031
AND SOMETHING
OUT OF THE SAFE

40:08.156 --> 40:09.699
AND GO
INTO THE FUNERAL HOME.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.076
THE MONEY MUST HAVE BEEN
IN THAT BAG.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.078
HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU,
MR. KELLY,

40:14.203 --> 40:15.872
THAT WHEN YOU BLEW UP
YOUR PARTNER

40:16.039 --> 40:18.499
THAT YOU MAY HAVE ALSO
BLOWN UP MY MONEY?

40:19.500 --> 40:21.961
YEAH, I HAD NIGHTMARES
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.297
BUT THEN I GOT
A PHOTOSTATIC COPY

40:24.464 --> 40:26.174
OF THE BOMB SQUAD REPORT.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.926
THERE WAS NO MONEY
IN THE DEBRIS,

40:28.051 --> 40:30.291
SO I FIGURE IT'S GOTTA BE
SOMEWHERE IN THAT FUNERAL HOME.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.556
MM-HMM.

40:40.855 --> 40:41.648
NICE.

40:41.773 --> 40:42.773
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

40:43.107 --> 40:44.418
I'D INVITE YOU TO DINNER,
MR. KELLY,

40:44.442 --> 40:47.445
BUT I SUGGEST YOU HAVE
MORE... PRESSING ENGAGEMENTS.

40:47.737 --> 40:50.865
LIKE GETTING OUT $250,000...

40:51.824 --> 40:53.284
BY TONIGHT.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.371
THERE YOU GO AGAIN
CREATING PRESSURES,

40:56.871 --> 40:58.539
IMPOSING DEADLINES.

41:00.083 --> 41:01.417
NO, MR. KELLY.

41:02.085 --> 41:02.752
WHAT I HAD IN MIND

41:02.877 --> 41:05.505
WAS SOMETHING
ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.108
YOU SEE, NOT ONLY DO I WANT
THE MONEY YOU GAMBLED AWAY

41:08.132 --> 41:09.133
ON MY CRAP TABLES,

41:09.258 --> 41:12.220
BUT I WANT HALF YOUR ACTION
IN QUEENS.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.179
AW, COME ON, MAN.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.098
OH, COME ON, MAN.

41:15.598 --> 41:18.935
WELL, WE SHOULD MAKE
SUPERB PARTNERS, MR. KELLY.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.479
AFTER ALL,
WE'RE BOTH CREATIVE MEN.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.482
WHO ELSE PLAYS THE CLARINET
BETTER THAN I DO?

41:24.607 --> 41:26.609
OR MAKES A BETTER
SHRIMP NEWBURG, HMM?

41:26.734 --> 41:29.070
NO WAY.
IT'S ALL TIED IN

41:29.195 --> 41:32.281
TO THE INSURANCE AND FUNERAL
OPERATION OUT FRONT.

41:32.407 --> 41:35.410
BESIDES, CAL'S SISTER
OWNS HIS SHARE.

41:35.702 --> 41:38.454
WELL, IF YOU WANT YOUR HALF,
YOU GET IT FROM HER.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.623
YOU HARDLY EXPECT ME
TO GIVE UP MY HALF.

41:42.542 --> 41:43.626
LOOK, MAN...

41:44.419 --> 41:45.211
SHE'S GOT A GUY.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.964
HIS NAME IS JOHN SHAFT,
AND HE'S A BAD DUDE.

41:48.131 --> 41:49.757
I CAN'T MESS WITH HER HALF.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.467
EVER HEAR OF JOHN SHAFT?

41:54.470 --> 41:56.723
YOU SEE, MR. KELLY?
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

41:56.848 --> 41:59.017
PASCAL HASN'T EVER
EVEN HEARD OF HIM.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.270
HE'S ALREADY INTO IT...

42:02.770 --> 42:04.105
SITTING
ON MY SHOULDERS, GUS.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.815
I CAN'T MAKE A MOVE.

42:11.779 --> 42:13.865
COULD WE BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE
WITH THE PROBLEM...

42:14.032 --> 42:15.676
ASSUMING, OF COURSE,
THAT WE'RE PARTNERS...

42:15.700 --> 42:17.577
50/50... IN YOUR WHEEL?

42:22.915 --> 42:24.834
TRY TO THINK FAST,
MR. KELLY.

42:31.632 --> 42:32.632
HMM?

42:38.598 --> 42:40.058
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF SHAFT?

42:40.183 --> 42:41.601
DEPEND ON IT.

45:11.584 --> 45:12.293
WHERE THE HELL YOU BEEN

45:12.418 --> 45:14.253
WITH
THE GODDAMNED ELEVATOR?

45:16.088 --> 45:19.300
YOU OUGHTN'T TALK
TO A LADY THAT WAY.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.845
WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING MANNERS,
ANYWAY?

45:40.571 --> 45:42.031
DO YOU HAVE TO GO?

45:42.657 --> 45:43.991
GOTTA SPLIT, BABY.

46:03.469 --> 46:04.262
RITA?

46:05.972 --> 46:07.265
STILL WANNA SEE HIM?

46:08.641 --> 46:10.101
DRIVE THAT CAT CRAZY?

46:10.434 --> 46:12.770
RITA! OPEN THE DOOR.

46:15.731 --> 46:17.024
RITA!

46:19.068 --> 46:21.737
RITA, OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!

46:21.904 --> 46:22.655
GOT A BACK ENTRANCE?

46:22.780 --> 46:23.906
MM-HMM.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.117
<i>RITA, OPEN THE DOOR.</i>

46:27.785 --> 46:29.912
<i>GOD DAMN IT, WOMAN,
OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!</i>

46:30.037 --> 46:31.580
<i>WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?</i>

46:32.707 --> 46:34.583
<i>RITA, OPEN
THE GODDAMN DOOR, WOMAN,</i>

46:34.750 --> 46:36.585
<i>BEFORE I KICK
THE SON OF A BITCH IN!</i>

46:37.295 --> 46:39.005
<i>I SAID OPEN THE DOOR!</i>

46:39.880 --> 46:41.924
<i>RITA, OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!</i>

46:42.049 --> 46:43.801
<i>WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?</i>

46:43.968 --> 46:44.969
<i>RITA?</i>

46:46.470 --> 46:48.264
YOU MEAN <i>THIS</i> DOOR?

46:52.184 --> 46:53.686
<i>CIAO,</i> BABY.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.984
OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!
RITA!

47:01.193 --> 47:03.487
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, WOMAN?
OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!

47:05.239 --> 47:06.699
<i>OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR!</i>

47:08.826 --> 47:10.178
<i>WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, WOMAN?</i>

47:10.202 --> 47:11.537
<i>OPEN THIS GODDAMN DOOR!</i>

47:13.998 --> 47:15.750
<i>I'LL KICK
THE SON OF A BITCH IN!</i>

47:19.003 --> 47:20.003
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,

47:20.755 --> 47:22.173
BUT THERE IT IS IN WRITING.

47:23.466 --> 47:24.592
SORRY, BABY.

47:25.634 --> 47:26.994
I WANTED TO OPEN YOUR EYES
EARLIER.

47:27.219 --> 47:29.099
<i>I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
WHAT KELLY'S SCENE WAS.</i>

47:29.472 --> 47:30.890
BUT TO DO THAT,

47:31.015 --> 47:33.100
I HAD TO LET YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR BROTHER WAS INTO.

47:34.560 --> 47:35.895
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE,

47:36.020 --> 47:38.060
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT THE CHILDCARE CENTER

47:38.105 --> 47:39.648
HE WAS PLANNING TO BUILD
UP IN HARLEM.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.734
YEAH, YOUR BROTHER
WAS A GOOD MAN.

47:41.859 --> 47:43.819
AT LEAST HE PUT THE MONEY
BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM.

47:45.738 --> 47:47.365
THAT'S MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR KELLY.

47:49.408 --> 47:50.534
JOHN...

47:52.995 --> 47:55.081
EXACTLY WHAT
DO THESE PAPERS MEAN?

47:55.456 --> 47:56.582
THAT'S SIMPLE...

47:56.707 --> 47:58.769
KELLY WAS BORROWING MONEY
FROM YOUR BROTHER FOR YEARS

47:58.793 --> 48:00.002
TO PAY OFF
HIS GAMBLING DEBTS.

48:02.088 --> 48:04.048
YOUR BROTHER
FINALLY DREW THE LINE...

48:04.173 --> 48:05.800
THE PAPER'S AN AGREEMENT
FROM KELLY

48:06.050 --> 48:07.635
FOR HIS INTEREST
IN THE BUSINESS...

48:11.097 --> 48:13.766
...IN RETURN FOR $250,000.

48:14.934 --> 48:15.952
IF YOUR BROTHER WERE ALIVE,

48:15.976 --> 48:18.437
KELLY WOULD BE BROKEN...
OUT ON HIS ASS.

48:20.272 --> 48:21.565
THE REST OF IT IS OBVIOUS.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.025
COME ON.
COME ON.

48:23.984 --> 48:24.985
- WHAT IS IT?
- UPSTAIRS.

48:25.111 --> 48:26.237
WHAT IS IT?!

48:34.036 --> 48:35.036
YEAH?

48:35.121 --> 48:36.121
FLOWERS.

48:36.205 --> 48:37.623
JUST LEAVE THEM AT THE DOOR.

48:37.748 --> 48:38.999
SORRY, YOU GOTTA SIGN.

48:40.334 --> 48:41.669
JUST A MINUTE.

48:52.471 --> 48:53.471
HUH!

49:01.355 --> 49:02.565
UGH!

49:07.903 --> 49:09.655
WHO PUT A CONTRACT OUT
ON ME?

49:23.627 --> 49:25.671
ARNA!
GET SOME THINGS TOGETHER,

49:25.796 --> 49:27.339
AND LET'S GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

49:41.979 --> 49:43.189
I WANNA SEE YOUR BOSS.

49:43.314 --> 49:44.440
WHAT ABOUT?

49:45.065 --> 49:46.525
INSURANCE.

49:46.650 --> 49:48.986
THE ONLY INSURANCE HE NEEDS
IS ME, SWEET PEA.

49:49.111 --> 49:50.831
LOOK, I'M NOT HERE
SELLING INSURANCE, CLOWN,

49:50.905 --> 49:52.281
AND YOU KNOW IT.
WHERE IS BUMPY?

49:52.406 --> 49:55.534
AIN'T BUYIN' NO COFFINS,
UNLESS HE'S BUYING YOURS.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.036
Bumpy: <i>BRING HIM IN, WILLY.</i>

50:00.748 --> 50:02.666
HE'S CLEAN, BOSS...

50:02.958 --> 50:05.211
CLEAN AS MR. CLEAN HIMSELF.

50:05.419 --> 50:08.380
"CLEAN" KELLY...
PRISTINE AND CLEAN.

50:08.547 --> 50:09.673
HAVE A DRINK.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.425
THANKS, BUMPY.

50:11.926 --> 50:12.635
TAKE A SEAT.

50:12.885 --> 50:14.678
NO, NO, MAN.
I'M ON THE MOVE.

50:14.803 --> 50:17.306
AIN'T A DAMN THING WRONG
WITH STANDING.

50:18.474 --> 50:20.559
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU,
KELLY.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.349
WHAT KIND OF HELP YOU NEED?

50:23.604 --> 50:25.523
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I NEED HELP?

50:25.773 --> 50:28.234
A MAN DON'T COME CALLING
ON HIS COMPETITORS

50:28.400 --> 50:29.443
UNLESS HE NEEDS HELP.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.862
WE'RE NOT COMPETITORS,
BUMPY.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.365
ANYBODY IN MY BUSINESS
<i>IS</i> A COMPETITOR.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.659
<i>A MAN WHO KNOWS MY GAME
CAN ALWAYS COME</i>

50:36.784 --> 50:39.203
INTO MY NEIGHBORHOOD
AND TRY TO PLAY IT.

50:39.370 --> 50:40.955
<i>SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT?</i>

50:41.080 --> 50:43.707
I'M SHOPPING
FOR A NEW PARTNER.

50:43.832 --> 50:45.668
<i>KINDA DANGEROUS
BEING YOUR PARTNER.</i>

50:47.253 --> 50:48.587
HOW MUCH IT GONNA COST ME?

50:49.547 --> 50:50.547
QUARTER OF A MILLION...

50:50.631 --> 50:51.799
UP FRONT.

50:52.466 --> 50:53.801
WHAT DOES THAT BUY ME?

50:54.468 --> 50:56.345
25% OF THE ACTION.

50:56.720 --> 50:57.888
GUS MASCOLA WOULD ASK YOU

50:58.013 --> 51:00.057
FOR A HELL OF A LOT MORE
THAN THAT, BABY.

51:01.392 --> 51:02.476
HOW ABOUT 50%?

51:04.728 --> 51:05.728
NO...

51:07.439 --> 51:10.067
WHY DON'T WE MAKE IT
60% OF THE ACTION?

51:10.359 --> 51:12.069
WHAT'S THAT EXTRA 10%?

51:12.778 --> 51:15.698
JUST IN CASE WE NEED
A CONTRACT ON MASCOLA.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.285
MAN, YOU'RE <i>REALLY</i> PUTTING
THE SCREWS TO ME.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.036
MASCOLA...
HE MIGHT NOT LIKE THE IDEA

51:21.203 --> 51:24.123
OF THIS NEW ARRANGEMENT
BETWEEN BROTHERS.

51:24.665 --> 51:26.625
<i>HE MIGHT WANNA TAKE
A LITTLE COUNTERACTION.</i>

51:26.750 --> 51:28.043
I CAN HANDLE THAT.

51:28.919 --> 51:29.962
BUT, UM...

51:31.797 --> 51:34.758
THERE IS ONE MORE...
LITTLE PROBLEM.

51:35.217 --> 51:37.344
NOTHING WE CAN'T HANDLE
TOGETHER, BROTHER.

51:38.053 --> 51:41.390
NOW, IF, UM, CAL'S LITTLE
SISTER OWNS HALF THE BUSINESS,

51:41.473 --> 51:43.183
AND YOU OWN 60%,

51:44.143 --> 51:46.270
THAT DON'T LEAVE NOTHING
FOR ME.

51:46.478 --> 51:48.647
NOW, LOOK, BABY BOO,

51:48.939 --> 51:51.066
THERE'S TROUBLES
AND TROUBLES,

51:51.191 --> 51:52.776
AND THIS ONE IS YOURS.

51:53.861 --> 51:54.861
WILLY!

51:55.112 --> 51:56.155
Willy: <i>YEAH, BOSS?</i>

51:56.822 --> 51:58.198
<i>WILLY WILL SHOW YOU OUT.</i>

52:00.534 --> 52:02.815
SEE THAT HE GETS THE MONEY
THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

52:03.203 --> 52:04.204
YEAH.

52:06.665 --> 52:07.833
YEAH, OKAY.

52:19.386 --> 52:22.806
BOSS, YOU TRUST
THIS NEGRO HERE?

52:24.600 --> 52:25.809
Bumpy: <i>HOLD IT, WILLY!</i>

52:31.565 --> 52:35.319
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT TRUSTING A DEAD MAN.

53:54.732 --> 53:55.858
CIGARETTE?

53:56.233 --> 53:57.568
NO, THANK YOU, BABY.

53:57.860 --> 53:59.236
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU OFFER ME?

53:59.903 --> 54:02.114
WELL, I'M OFF AT 4:00.

54:59.546 --> 55:01.924
HEY, BABY,
WHERE'S YOUR WOMAN?

55:02.800 --> 55:04.301
I'M TRAVELING
KIND OF LIGHT TONIGHT.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.053
OH?

55:08.722 --> 55:10.390
100 BUCKS SAYS
THAT BACK DOOR DOESN'T LEAD

55:10.516 --> 55:11.600
TO THE PARKING LOT.

55:18.816 --> 55:20.192
I'M NOT A GAMBLING WOMAN.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.236
I'M A GAMBLING MAN.

55:23.403 --> 55:25.447
I THOUGHT IT WAS <i>MY</i> ACTION
YOU WERE DIGGING HERE.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.158
<i>I NEVER TOOK YOU
FOR A GAMBLER.</i>

55:29.535 --> 55:30.536
BUT...

55:30.702 --> 55:32.871
IF THAT'S YOUR MEAT,
THAT'S THE DOOR.

55:33.455 --> 55:35.123
YOU'RE PUSHING
MIGHTY HARD, MY MAN.

55:38.460 --> 55:39.979
MAYBE I OUGHTA PUSH
THE BOYS IN THE BACK

55:40.003 --> 55:41.883
THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING
ALL YOUR MONEY, MR. KELLY.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.724
OKAY.

55:53.058 --> 55:54.369
YOU EXTEND HIM
FOR ANOTHER FIVE GRAND

55:54.393 --> 55:56.770
AND NOT ONE CENT MORE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

56:00.607 --> 56:01.400
OKAY.

56:01.567 --> 56:02.693
Kelly: <i>LISTEN, GUS...</i>

56:07.030 --> 56:08.030
YOU, UM...

56:08.949 --> 56:10.993
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF SHAFT.

56:11.118 --> 56:12.118
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD YOU.

56:12.369 --> 56:13.569
WELL, MAN,
HE'S RIGHT OUT THERE

56:13.704 --> 56:15.038
AT A RINGSIDE TABLE.

56:15.831 --> 56:17.541
AND HE'S <i>NOT</i> HERE
TO SEE THE FLOOR SHOW.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.167
<i>THERE'S GONNA BE TROUBLE.</i>

56:19.918 --> 56:21.587
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

56:21.712 --> 56:22.754
WE MADE A DEAL.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.214
AND I JUST CALLED IT OFF.

56:25.257 --> 56:26.609
YOU SEE, MR. KELLY,
I MADE A TEST RUN...

56:26.633 --> 56:29.094
A SORT OF A HOUSE CALL...
ON MR. SHAFT.

56:29.219 --> 56:30.387
DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL.

56:31.138 --> 56:32.890
<i>IT COST ME
A DEAD SECOND COUSIN</i>

56:33.265 --> 56:36.059
AND A FRIEND'S KID BROTHER
WITH TWO HITS IN THE CHEST.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.733
AREN'T YOU GONNA SETTLE
THE SCORE?

56:43.066 --> 56:44.401
THE QUESTION IS,

56:44.735 --> 56:46.236
WHO IS HE HERE
TO SETTLE WITH...

56:46.361 --> 56:48.113
ME OR YOU?

56:49.740 --> 56:50.860
<i>YOU'RE A GAMBLER, MR. KELLY.</i>

56:50.908 --> 56:51.908
SO AM I.

56:53.201 --> 56:54.745
NOW, I'M BETTING THAT, UH...

56:55.913 --> 56:57.706
<i>YOU'RE</i> SHAFT'S TARGET
FOR TONIGHT.

56:58.624 --> 56:59.976
SUPPOSE I JUST LET HIM
DO HIS THING...

57:00.000 --> 57:01.752
SAY, UH, KNOCK YOU OFF?

57:02.753 --> 57:04.230
<i>AFTER ALL,
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT TOTALED</i>

57:04.254 --> 57:05.589
<i>HIS GIRLFRIEND'S BIG BROTHER.</i>

57:07.090 --> 57:08.508
AND WHEN YOU COME TO THINK
ABOUT IT,

57:08.675 --> 57:10.636
WHY SHOULD I DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP YOU ALIVE?

57:10.761 --> 57:12.864
<i>YOU HAVEN'T EVEN COME UP WITH
THE MONEY YOU OWE ME YET.</i>

57:12.888 --> 57:15.891
TOMORROW, I TOLD YOU!
GOT IT?

57:16.475 --> 57:17.935
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED RENEWING

57:18.101 --> 57:20.312
YOUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH CAL ASBY?

57:20.479 --> 57:21.855
COME ON, MAN.
HE'S DEAD.

57:23.690 --> 57:25.150
PRECISELY.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.279
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT DUDE IS INTO.

57:29.404 --> 57:30.614
HE'S BUMPY'S BOY.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.033
<i>UNDERSTAND THAT?</i>

57:33.158 --> 57:35.535
AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO TAKE
OVER MY WHEEL IN QUEENS.

57:36.536 --> 57:37.955
SHAFT IS WORKING FOR BUMPY?

57:40.999 --> 57:42.542
NOW YOU'RE GETTING SMART.

58:10.570 --> 58:11.822
WELL...

58:13.365 --> 58:15.951
WE'LL SEND MR. SHAFT
BACK TO BUMPY

58:17.327 --> 58:19.788
WITH A MESSAGE
THEY UNDERSTAND UPTOWN.

58:20.539 --> 58:21.748
PASCAL...

58:43.103 --> 58:44.438
IT'S IN THERE.

58:45.188 --> 58:46.314
LET HIM IN.

58:58.994 --> 59:00.078
YOU LOOKING FOR ME?

59:01.997 --> 59:03.999
I'VE BEEN HEARING QUITE A BIT
ABOUT YOU, MR. SHAFT.

59:04.124 --> 59:06.001
YOU'RE, UH, QUITE A BOY.

59:07.335 --> 59:09.171
I PREFER <i>MAN.</i>

59:09.337 --> 59:12.424
ALL RIGHT... MAN.

59:14.718 --> 59:16.428
WHAT BRINGS YOU AROUND HERE?

59:18.680 --> 59:21.475
FORGOT TO TIP YOUR BOYS WHEN
THEY DELIVERED THE FLOWERS.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.700
THE ONLY REASON
I DON'T SPILL YOUR GUTS OUT

59:26.730 --> 59:28.398
RIGHT HERE AND NOW, MAN,

59:28.565 --> 59:31.151
IS THAT IT'S EASIER FOR ME
TO SEND YOU BACK TO BUMPY

59:31.276 --> 59:34.029
WITH MY MESSAGE
THAN TO CALL WESTERN UNION.

59:34.154 --> 59:35.739
AND THE MESSAGE IS

59:35.864 --> 59:38.366
YOU KEEP THE HELL
OUT OF QUEENS.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.743
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.162
WHAT ROUND
DID YOU GO OUT IN, MAN?

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.331
YOU AIN'T AS PRETTY
AS YOU USED TO BE.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.602
Shaft: <i>YOU BETTER SEE A PLASTIC
SURGEON ABOUT YOUR CONDITION.</i>

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:17.836
WHAT CONDITION?

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.629
YOUR MOUTH IS TOO CLOSE
TO YOUR ASSHOLE.

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:23.133
SIT DOWN, SHAFT.
SAVE YOUR ENERGY.

01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:25.760
THAT'S REAL
PROFESSIONAL WORK.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:27.178
WHO DID THE JOB?

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.931
HE WAS TALKING WHEN HE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN LISTENING.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.099
DUDE NAMED MASCOLA.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.091
<i>FIGURED I WAS WORKING
WITH YOU.</i>

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:35.270
I'M YOUR LIVING MESSAGE.
"STAY OUT OF QUEENS."

01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:36.730
<i>THAT'S WHAT THE MAN SAID.</i>

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:38.565
WHAT BUSINESS I GOT
IN QUEENS, WILLY?

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.127
KELLY BEEN AROUND HERE
TO SEE YOU LATELY?

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.236
<i>LOTS OF CATS
COME AND GO AROUND HERE.</i>

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.446
FIGURED YOU OUGHT TO KNOW

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.823
KELLY'S BEEN HANGING AROUND
WITH MASCOLA A LOT LATELY.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.825
YEAH, THAT KELLY...

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.702
HE'S A BUSY BOY.

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:53.413
DEAL HERE, DEAL THERE, HUH?

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.668
UNDESIRABLE CHARACTER.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.503
WAIT OUTSIDE, WILLY.

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:08.845
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, SHAFT?

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:11.806
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
FOR ANYTHING.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:13.558
JUST DELIVERED
MASCOLA'S MESSAGE.

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:16.266
AND I'LL SEE HIM TOMORROW.

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:40.335
THAT DAMN ITALIAN IS SERIOUS.

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:46.257
WILLY, GET YOUR ASS IN HERE!

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:47.884
I'M COMING, BUMPY!

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:53.473
USED TO BE COWBOYS AND INDIANS.
NOW IT'S US AND THEM.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.731
YOU CALL KELLY.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.984
YOU TELL HIM
HIS LOAN'S BEEN CANCELED.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.153
THEN TOMORROW
YOU'LL GO ALONG WITH SHAFT

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:08.822
TO GET THAT MASCOLA,

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.908
'CAUSE I WANT HIM BAD...
REAL BAD.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.827
NOW, GET TO IT, BABY.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.632
OH, HONEY,
YOU SURE WERE RIGHT

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:29.259
ABOUT THAT WATER BED.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:30.552
WOW.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.596
Woman: <i>I THOUGHT
YOU'D DIG THAT, BABY.</i>

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:36.433
$10,000 FOR THIS THING.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:37.392
HO, HO.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.185
HO, HO.
HO, HO, HO.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:41.688
YOU WANT ME TO LOOK NICE,
DON'T YOU?

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:44.041
WHAT THE HELL DO I CARE
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.692
WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON, HUH?

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.903
SERVICE.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.867
HAVEN'T YOU HAD
ENOUGH SERVICE?

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:57.078
ZIP MY DRESS, PLEASE.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.290
YOU KNOW...

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.586
I HAVE A TENDENCY
TO SPOIL YOU, BABY.

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:09.674
MMM. DO IT, DO IT, DO IT.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:22.061
IS THIS TRIP
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY?

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.815
JUST WASH THE WINDOW, MAN.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:29.861
AHH.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:39.704
OH. AGAIN?

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.165
YOU LOVE IT.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.418
I LOVE IT.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.762
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.431
THEY'VE ALREADY DONE IT.

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:00.683
NOW IT'S OUR TURN.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.901
MMM. GOTTA GO.

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.240
<i>YOU'RE LOOKIN' GOOD, BABY.</i>

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:19.285
DO YOUR NUMBER.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:55.863
YOU READY?

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.031
YEAH, I'M READY.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:21.305
I'LL TAKE THE WHITE BOY
AND GIVE ANYBODY $65

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:23.349
THEY DON'T GO
ANOTHER TWO ROUNDS.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.518
OHH!

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.273
RUMBLE WITH HIM, JUNIOR.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.705
<i>COME ON, MAN.</i>

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:48.041
COME ON!!

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.839
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU COME
ALONG FOR, THE RIDE, MAN?!

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.256
I HEARD YOU WAS GOOD,
SHAFT.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:59.176
I WANNA SEE HOW GOOD
YOU CAN DO YOUR THING.

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.305
COME ON!!

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.148
AAH!

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:20.072
GOOD, JUNIOR.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:36.255
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE,
JUNIOR.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.803
I'D STEP
ON YOUR GODDAMN THROAT,

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:45.180
BUT I'D RATHER SEE YOU AND KELLY
FRY FOR KILLING CAL ASBY.

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:47.600
AND HE'S MY NEXT VISIT.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.185
I OWE IT TO HIM.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:53.773
YEAH. AND HE OWES <i>ME.</i>

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.025
LIKE WHAT, $250 GRAND?

01:09:58.236 --> 01:10:00.321
I SEE YOU'VE BEEN DOING
YOUR HOMEWORK, BOY.

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:08.079
LET'S GET THE HELL
OUTTA HERE.

01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:10.123
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE HIM
LIKE THAT?

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:12.709
A MAN <i>CAN</i> FALL
OUT THE WINDOW, YOU KNOW?

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:15.712
AND HIM, TOO.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:18.464
WE ALREADY GOT ENOUGH SHIT
ON THE SIDEWALK.

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:15.938
I'M SORRY, GUS.

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.358
WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU?

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:23.070
YOU SENT ME OUT
TO GET THE PEPPERS.

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:26.574
YOU GET THE REAL HOT ONES?

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:31.204
YEAH, I GOT THE REAL...
GOT THE REAL HOT ONES.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:32.455
GOOD.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.124
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.462
YOU TAKE THEM ONE AT A TIME

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.341
AND YOU SHOVE THEM
UP YOUR ASS.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.899
BEEN KEEPING THIS ROOM
CLEAN BACK HERE?

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.024
YEAH.

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:46.612
UH, TELL ME, JESSE,

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.116
DID YOU SEE MR. ASBY
THE NIGHT THAT HE WAS KILLED?

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.618
YEAH. I WAS STRAIGHTENING UP
IN THE CHAPEL,

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.955
HEARD SOMEBODY IN HERE,
CAME IN TO SEE.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.456
IT WAS MR. ASBY, ALL RIGHT.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:58.708
WHAT WAS HE DOING?

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.626
JUST STANDING.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:04.797
MM-HMM. AND DID HE HAVE
ANYTHING WITH HIM?

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:06.591
I DON'T...

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.885
YEAH.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:11.679
<i>I THINK HE</i> DID <i>HAVE
SOMETHING WITH HIM.</i>

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.641
YEAH, I REMEMBER...
A SHOPPING BAG...

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:20.146
LIKE HE HAD GONE TO THE STORE
AND WAS TAKING GROCERIES.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:21.772
GROCERIES?

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.233
- THAT COULDN'T BE, THOUGH.
- WELL, WHY NOT?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.902
HE DIDN'T HAVE IT
WHEN HE LEFT.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.278
I CAME OUT TO SAY GOODNIGHT,

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:29.488
BUT HE HAD ALREADY GONE
NEXT DOOR

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.741
TO THE INSURANCE OFFICE,

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.492
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE IT
WITH HIM THEN.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.953
HMM. THAT'S FUNNY.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:41.584
NOTHING IN THERE, MR. KELLY.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:45.004
I DUST AND VACUUM THESE BOXES
TWICE EVERY WEEK.

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:46.839
MM-HMM.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.175
AND THEY'RE ALL
STILL HERE...

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:51.510
EXCEPT THE ONE OVER THERE

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:53.721
THAT POOR MR. ASBY
WAS BURIED IN.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:13:59.727
THANK YOU, JESSE.

01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:02.897
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:13.134
Bollin: <i>STAY ON THAT TAIL.</i>

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:00.681
Bollin: <i>HEY, SHAFT...</i>

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:03.559
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:08.189
I THOUGHT WE WAS GONNA
KEEP IN TOUCH.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:09.732
DIDN'T YOU GET MY MESSAGE?

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.943
I LEFT IT
ON CAL'S DOORSTEP.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.235
YEAH.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.571
WHERE'S ARNA ASBY?

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:20.659
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED
THAT QUESTION YESTERDAY,

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:22.828
BEFORE MASCOLA
SENT HER FLOWERS.

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:24.830
I'M ASKING YOU NOW.

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:28.167
ARE YOU GONNA PROTECT HER,
OR ARE YOU GONNA HASSLE HER?

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:30.377
YOU LEAVE THAT TO ME.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:34.757
I KNOW SHE'S HERE IN YOUR PAD,
AND I'M GONNA SEE HER.

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.092
OPEN IT UP.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:38.427
BE MY GUEST.

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:04.703
SON OF A BITCH!

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.080
SHE'LL GO TO JAIL FOR THAT.

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:07.706
TOLD YOU
SHE DIDN'T WANNA TALK.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:09.792
WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:12.378
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT
BLACK LADY IN THERE,

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:15.131
AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT
HER DEATH ON YOUR RECORD...

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:17.716
ESPECIALLY
AFTER PROTECTING HER SO.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:21.762
OPEN THIS DOOR, MISS ASBY!

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:23.389
THIS IS CAPTAIN BOLLIN.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:26.225
YOU GET AWAY FROM THERE!
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE!

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:30.146
I'LL BE BACK WITH A WARRANT
AND WITNESSES.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.857
YOU TWO BETTER BE HERE.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:39.904
IT'S ME, BABY.

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.790
YOU ALMOST SHOT A CAPTAIN.

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.338
MAN'S GONNA BE BACK HERE
WITH A WARRANT

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:58.757
AS SOON AS HE CAN FIND
A JUDGE TO SIGN IT.

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:02.178
FOR ME?

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:05.472
NO SWEAT.
THE GUN'S REGISTERED.

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:08.642
LOOK, YOU THOUGHT
SOMEONE WAS BREAKING IN,

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:09.911
YOU WANTED TO
PROTECT YOURSELF,

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:12.021
YOU PICKED UP A GUN,
FIRED OFF A COUPLE OF SHOTS.

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:13.898
BUT WHY ARE THEY AFTER <i>ME?</i>

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:15.900
NOTHING PERSONAL.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.613
THEY'RE AFTER CAL'S MONEY
AND HIS OPERATION IN QUEENS,

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:22.740
AND ANYBODY
WHO GETS IN HIS WAY...

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:25.034
INCLUDING HIS KID SISTER
AND ME...

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:31.123
BUT CAN'T WE JUST LET THEM
HAVE IT?

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:35.270
YOU'RE FORGETTING THE CLINIC
THAT CAL WANTED TO BUILD

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:36.545
FOR THE KIDS UP IN HARLEM.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.799
<i>THE FUNERAL BUSINESS,
THE INSURANCE COMPANY</i>...

01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:42.343
IT'S ALL GOOD BUSINESS.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:44.637
YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST
GIVE IT AWAY.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.601
LOOK, WHEN BOLLIN GETS HERE...
THAT'S THE CAPTAIN'S NAME...

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:53.938
<i>LET HIM IN, TALK TO HIM,
TELL HIM ANYTHING YOU WANT,</i>

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:55.522
<i>BUT JUST KEEP HIM HERE.</i>

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:06.075
AS LONG AS HE'S HERE,
NO ONE CAN GET TO YOU.

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:13.122
JOHN...

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:14.875
NOT NOW, BABY, NOT NOW.

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:36.397
<i>BOLLIN'S LEFT HIS BABYSITTERS.</i>

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.334
WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE DOING HERE?

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.588
YOU SURE ARE
A HARD MAN TO FIND.

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:04.466
TOO MANY PEOPLE
LOOKING FOR ME, BABY.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:06.592
CAN YOU DRIVE THAT THING?

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:11.598
ANYTHING WITH A STICK SHIFT
IS MY MEAT.

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.559
IS THAT RIGHT?

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:16.020
HOW ABOUT DRIVING IT UP
A ONE-WAY STREET FOR ME?

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.021
ALL RIGHT.

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:18.146
HERE'S THE KEYS.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.732
JUST JUMP IN
AND START IT UP, OKAY?

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:48.135
HEY, YOU LEFT HIM
AT THE POST.

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:51.513
YOU DO THAT GOOD.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:54.224
BEEN RACING
SINCE I WAS 14.

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:56.602
MEN OR CARS?

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.773
HEY, BABY, KEEP BOTH HANDS
ON THE WHEEL, HUH?

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.859
HEY, IS THAT SNOW?

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.652
IT SURE AIN'T COTTON.

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:48.695
HELLO?

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:51.240
YEAH.

01:21:52.199 --> 01:21:53.325
UH-HUH.

01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:55.326
WHAT'S HE DOING?

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:57.329
THEY'RE DIGGING
A GRAVE, GUS.

01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:00.934
THAT'S A HELL OF A TIME.
NOW, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:01.750
MOTHER IKE'S.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.419
MOTHER IKE'S, MY ASS.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:06.003
MOTHER IKE'S, <i>MY</i> ASS.

COME ON.
COME ON, I SAID, HUH?!

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:11.677
SHITHEAD!

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.554
I'LL GIVE YOU SHITHEAD.

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:17.599
I'M SORRY.
GO AHEAD.

01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:20.018
YEAH.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:21.913
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU STICK
WITH THEM, YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.355
WE'RE GONNA BE RIGHT THERE.

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:25.648
OKAY.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:29.445
PASCAL...

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:32.739
PASCAL!!

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:34.158

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:38.203
GET JACK AND AL RIGHT AWAY.

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.624
JACK! JACK, GET UP!

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:45.419
AL! COME ON!
GET YOUR ASS UP!

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.695
GOOD MORNING, MR. KELLY.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:54.947
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:56.073
MONEY.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.033
THE MONEY'S IN THE BOX,

01:23:58.158 --> 01:23:59.478
AND ALL I GOT TO DO
IS GET IT OUT.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:02.287
THEN WHAT, MR. KELLY?

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.081
YOU'LL GET WHAT I OWE YOU.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:06.041
HEY, THEN IT'S
ME AND YOU, GUS,

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.460

AND EVERYTHING ELSE, MAN.

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:10.045
GO AHEAD. GET IT.

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.673
<i>GO AHEAD.</i>

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.470
<i>FIND IT, MR. KELLY?</i>

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:21.098
MAYBE IT'S IN HIS WALLET.

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:26.353
I CAN'T.

01:24:27.145 --> 01:24:28.564
GIVE HIM A HAND.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:37.864
ROLL IT IN.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:39.491

KELLY'S ALREADY

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:29.161
RIGHT NEXT TO CAL ASBY.

01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:32.123
AND YOU'VE <i>STILL</i> GOT
A LOT OF BURYING TO DO.

01:43:32.832 --> 01:43:34.583
THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,

01:43:35.251 --> 01:43:37.420
BUT WHERE'S
THE DAMN MONEY, MAN?

01:43:38.003 --> 01:43:40.840
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I GOT A FEELING

01:43:40.965 --> 01:43:42.317
IT'S ON ITS WAY BACK UP

01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:43.718
