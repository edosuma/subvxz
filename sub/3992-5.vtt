00:02.070 --> 00:03.719
- Who stitched him
into the mural?

00:03.770 --> 00:06.398
- You have an idea who
that might be?
- I do.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.500
- He consu|t_s me v_vith_cases
IfI keep Investigating
murders he's accused of.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.701
- Good. It seems
you have an admirer.

00:11.740 --> 00:14.334
_ - You think someone sent me
In here because they admire me?

00:14.380 --> 00:17.543
- This killer wrote you a poem.
- This is of course Freddie
Lounds, who you know.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.639
She will be assisting me today,
or assisting you--

00:19.680 --> 00:22.114
- What have you taken, Bella?
- My morphine.

00:22.150 --> 00:25.085
- Have you seen Jack?
- No. There was some sort
of emergency With his Wife.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.712
- If Hannibal's the ripper,
what's he doing with
his trophies?

00:26.760 --> 00:29.058
- Stay away from
Hannibal Lecter.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.422
(gunshot)

00:31.460 --> 00:35.556
***

01:16.410 --> 01:19.834
- You have to eat something,
Jack. You've been up all night.

01:26.550 --> 01:29.417
Feed the body,
feed the mind.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.426
- She knew she couldn't
beat the cancer, so she...

01:36.460 --> 01:39.827
decided to beat it
to the finish line.

01:42.330 --> 01:46.232
I suppose I can't blame her for
wanting to control how she dies.

01:46.270 --> 01:48.465
- I believe those who
can no longer function

01:48.500 --> 01:52.209
at an acceptable level
have the right to die.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.129
- She cast you
as an executioner.

01:55.180 --> 01:58.502
She wanted
to die.

02:00.650 --> 02:03.414
I can't tell you how grateful
I am that you didn't
allow it to happen.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.888
- As a doctor,
I had no choice.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.525
As a philosopher,
I had too many.

02:12.830 --> 02:16.527
It wasn't what I could do
for Bella, it was what
I couldn't do to you, Jack.

02:18.530 --> 02:21.363
I guess I'm a better friend
than therapist.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.533
- You're a great friend,
Hannibal.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.864
(trickling sound)

03:57.300 --> 03:59.962
- Send someone else, Jack.

04:02.070 --> 04:04.231
She's one of yours.

05:25.620 --> 05:28.919
***

05:58.720 --> 06:01.553
- At approximately 9 AM this
morning, I received a phone call

06:01.590 --> 06:05.082
_from Freddie Lounds. _
Acting on an anonymous tip,

06:05.130 --> 06:07.598
she discovered a female body,

06:07.630 --> 06:10.463
immediately contacted my office.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.866
I was amongst the first
on the scene.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.095
The victim has been identified
as our colleague,

06:15.140 --> 06:18.166
Special Agent Beverly Katz.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.735
She will be memorialized

06:20.780 --> 06:22.748
at FBI Headquarters
and Field Offices

06:22.780 --> 06:26.819
so_ that her ultimate sacrifice
Will always be remembered.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.042
That's all.

06:35.490 --> 06:38.823
(trickling sound)

07:06.960 --> 07:11.124
(inaudible)

07:13.130 --> 07:15.098
- I want to see her.

08:01.780 --> 08:04.169
- Leave us alone.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.609
Let's go!

09:50.120 --> 09:53.988
- You said you just
interpret the evidence.

09:54.020 --> 09:56.887
So interpret
the evidence.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.017
(yelping)
- I strangle Beverly Katz...

10:59.250 --> 11:01.218
...looking in her eyes.

11:01.260 --> 11:04.184
She knows me.

11:06.260 --> 11:08.990
And I know her.

11:09.030 --> 11:12.796
I expertly squeeze
the life from her...

11:14.800 --> 11:16.802
...rendering her unconscious.

11:25.910 --> 11:28.140
I freeze her body...

11:30.150 --> 11:31.845
...preserving shape and form

11:31.890 --> 11:35.417
so I can more cleanly
dismantle her.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.366
She cuts like stone.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.768
I pull her apart,

11:49.810 --> 11:53.200
layer by layer...

11:55.340 --> 11:58.776
...like she would a crime scene.

11:58.810 --> 12:01.244
This is my design.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.343
I will leave

12:05.390 --> 12:07.779
no usable evidence,

12:07.820 --> 12:11.256
but she found something.

12:11.290 --> 12:14.088
She found me.

12:14.130 --> 12:16.894
What she found is already gone.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.064
What did I take from her?

12:36.950 --> 12:39.783
- It's the Chesapeake Ripper.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.784
- It's the Ripper

12:44.830 --> 12:46.821
and the Copycat.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.969
It's the same killer.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.991
Two masks...

12:56.200 --> 12:58.407
Beverly helped me see it.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.442
- Help me see it.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.972
- She was looking

13:08.020 --> 13:11.285
for a connection between
the Copycat and the Ripper.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.550
- You think she found it?

13:16.590 --> 13:19.354
- She found something.

13:23.630 --> 13:26.224
Where were you
last night?

13:29.270 --> 13:32.205
- In the hospital.
With my Wife.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.572
- I told Beverly

13:34.610 --> 13:37.977
to go to you,

13:38.010 --> 13:40.911
tell you everything she knew.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.809
Instead, she went
looking for evidence.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.548
She met the Ripper
last night, Jack.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.591
She...

13:56.630 --> 13:59.565
she will be...

13:59.600 --> 14:02.865
missing organs.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.537
He had to take
his trophies.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.879
- Who is he, Will?

14:19.590 --> 14:23.128
- Beverly made her
connection to the Ripper.

14:25.930 --> 14:29.058
You have to make
your own, Jack.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.958
- Then What did I
bring you here for?

14:37.170 --> 14:39.638
- To say goodbye.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.429
- Would you like to talk
about What happened
at the observatory?

14:58.460 --> 15:01.190
- You discussed my therapy

15:01.230 --> 15:03.391
with Hannibal Lecter, Frederick.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.398
Counter to our agreement.

15:05.430 --> 15:08.433
- I gave him a peek before
I snatched down the shades.

15:08.470 --> 15:11.109
- I have appearances
to maintain.

15:14.740 --> 15:18.346
- Beverly Katz paid you a visit
before she was murdered.

15:18.380 --> 15:21.372
What did the two of you discuss?
- What, you weren't listening
to that one?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.585
- You_met her in
the privacy room.

15:25.620 --> 15:29.317
It is the only room
in the facility I am not
legally allowed to monitor.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.419
- And you let that stop you?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.663
We talked about
the Chesapeake Ripper.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.260
Then she went and found him.

15:43.470 --> 15:46.667
- Psychopaths can be indifferent
to those sorts of setbacks.

15:46.710 --> 15:49.599
I know something
of the monster

15:49.640 --> 15:52.200
you are
dealing with.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.014
He is a well-
educated man.

15:55.050 --> 15:57.746
A socially competent man.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.009
He has surgical experience or,
at the very least, know-how.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.654
- You thought Abel Gideon
was the Chesapeake Ripper.

16:03.690 --> 16:07.228
- Evidently, I was
wrong about that.

16:07.260 --> 16:10.093
- Gideon knows
who the Ripper is.
- And I suppose you do, too.

16:12.100 --> 16:15.263
- Wouldn't it be interesting
if we both said it was
the same man?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.298
- Yes, it would.

16:19.340 --> 16:22.275
- It's a shame we can't
talk to Abel Gideon

16:22.310 --> 16:24.608
about the Chesapeake Ripper.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.675
Well, just think, Frederick,

16:26.710 --> 16:30.009
you could be the one
who catches him after all.

16:44.130 --> 16:47.463
- Beverly isn't
your responsibility.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.230
You should be allowed to grieve.
You shouldn't have to wade
through it.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.500
- We're not running away
from this, Jack.

16:52.540 --> 16:55.100
Beverly wouldn't.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.108
- Good.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.106
- I double-checked
the autopsy report.

16:59.150 --> 17:02.176
What you found at that
observatory wasn't all Beverly.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.687
- What do you mean?

17:03.720 --> 17:06.439
- These kidneys, they were
placed inside her body

17:06.490 --> 17:09.653
after she was killed. I typed
them against DNA samples

17:09.690 --> 17:13.524
and, uh, they belong to the
Mural Killer. James Gray.
- James Gray.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.551
So, Whoever killed
James Gray and sewed him

17:15.600 --> 17:18.763
into his mural also murdered
Beverly. Swapped out
their kidneys.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.530
- Right now, the only thing
we have to go on

17:21.570 --> 17:24.164
is we find her kidneys
and we find her killer.

17:24.210 --> 17:28.101
***

18:15.290 --> 18:17.622
- Mr. Graham.

18:19.690 --> 18:23.365
You always did look
like the boy next door.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.392
Is it true you ate
that poor Hobbs girl?

18:26.430 --> 18:28.739
- You can call me Will,

18:28.770 --> 18:31.409
now we're of equal
social standing.

18:34.210 --> 18:37.441
- Is this Frederick's
idea of punishment?

18:37.480 --> 18:40.608
Group therapy with the man
who tried to kill me.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.312
- No. I'd like to talk to you

18:43.350 --> 18:45.648
about the Chesapeake Ripper.

18:45.690 --> 18:49.148
- Thought I was the Chesapeake
Ripper.
- No,

18:49.190 --> 18:51.522
you are the pretender
to the throne.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.597
- What did you offer Frederick
to bring me back?

18:54.630 --> 18:58.191
I'm the last person
he wants to see.

18:58.230 --> 19:01.631
I give him a visceral
chill in the guts.

19:01.670 --> 19:05.265
Whatever's left of them.
- You know who the Chesapeake
Ripper is. You've met him.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.768
- So Frederick gets to catch
the Ripper after all.

19:08.810 --> 19:11.347
What do you get?

19:17.950 --> 19:21.249
- I remember that night
at Dr. Lecter's.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.418
The night I brought you there.
- The night you tried
to kill me.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.587
- Yes, how do you think
I found you?

19:26.630 --> 19:28.655
He sent me to kill you, Abel.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.731
- Am I your evidence?

19:33.770 --> 19:36.489
Oh, you're
in trouble,

19:36.540 --> 19:38.861
Mr. Graham.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.878
- Why would you protect him?

19:40.910 --> 19:42.969
- You were quite
happy to try

19:43.010 --> 19:45.706
and kill me yourself.

19:45.750 --> 19:48.241
You have it "in you,"
as they say.

19:53.590 --> 19:56.718
He is the Devil,
Mr. Graham.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.251
He is smoke.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.228
You'll never
"catch" the Ripper.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.898
He won't be caught.

20:05.930 --> 20:07.898
If you want him...

20:09.900 --> 20:11.765
...you will have
to kill him.

20:14.510 --> 20:16.501
- Fair enough.

20:23.020 --> 20:26.410
- You and I are both proponents

20:26.450 --> 20:28.486
of unorthodox treatments
of the mind.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.819
Strategies others might not
choose to understand.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.923
What I'm trying
to understand

20:36.960 --> 20:40.339
is Why you would transfer Abel
Gideon back to your hospital

20:40.370 --> 20:42.668
for the unworried unwell.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.804
- It _was not for
selfish reasons.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.435
- Ah, selfishness.
The original sin of man,

20:48.480 --> 20:50.641
according to Judeo-
Christian morality.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.569
- We are not talking about
morality or ethics here,

20:53.620 --> 20:57.545
are we, Dr. Lecter? But rather,
concealing their absence.

20:59.990 --> 21:02.879
- Gideon disemboweled you,
Frederick.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.684
Brave of you, or perhaps Wise,

21:05.730 --> 21:08.449
to keep the evidence
of your misdeeds

21:08.500 --> 21:11.560
under your own roof.
- My misdeeds and yours.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.591
- Neither of us

21:13.640 --> 21:15.596
controls our stories well enough

21:15.640 --> 21:19.360
to get anything from exposing
the other's misdeeds.

21:21.610 --> 21:24.602
- Here's to that.

21:32.590 --> 21:35.809
I brought Gideon back because...

21:35.860 --> 21:38.420
I thought he may be useful

21:38.460 --> 21:40.690
in Will Graham's therapy.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.567
He shot Gideon, yet
he has no memory of it.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.989
- We know memories, emotions,

21:48.040 --> 21:51.635
and even spiritual experiences

21:51.670 --> 21:53.831
can be manipulated
While under hypnotics.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.839
- I'm trying to set Will
on the path to rebuilding
his broken brain,

21:57.880 --> 22:00.974
picking up your pieces,
as it were.

22:04.150 --> 22:06.710
- You've analyzed my patient;

22:06.750 --> 22:09.355
perhaps you'll allow me
to analyze yours.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.497
I'd like to interview
Abel Gideon.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.716
- You don't need
to stand way over there.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.741
I'm a cutter, not a pisser.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.511
- Hello, Dr. Gideon.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.721
- Our brains
devote more space

22:43.760 --> 22:45.978
to reading
the details of faces

22:46.030 --> 22:48.089
than any other object.

22:48.130 --> 22:50.826
Dare I say,

22:50.870 --> 22:53.566
I've never seen yours before.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.533
- I'm Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

22:58.570 --> 23:02.074
I was Will_Graham's
psychiatrist.

23:02.110 --> 23:04.442
- Well, he's not
a very good advertisement

23:04.480 --> 23:06.471
for your abilities,
Dr. Lecter.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.114
- That remains
to be seen.

23:08.150 --> 23:11.085
- Oh,

23:11.120 --> 23:13.918
I bet you're a devil
at the bridge table.

23:16.220 --> 23:19.087
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.
- The pleasure's mine.

23:19.130 --> 23:21.121
- [But now I know your name,]

23:21.160 --> 23:23.128
[of course I am aware
of you by reputation]

23:23.160 --> 23:25.765
[and I see Why Chilton]

23:25.800 --> 23:28.564
[both reveres you
and resents you.]

23:28.600 --> 23:31.467
Esteem in psychiatric circles
still eludes him,

23:31.510 --> 23:34.399
yet it clings to you
like soap to a baby's eyes.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.576
He very much
wants to be you.

23:38.610 --> 23:41.010
- He should be more careful
What he Wishes for.

23:41.050 --> 23:44.144
- And you should have been
more careful with Will Graham.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.818
That young man
has got a bone to pick.

23:46.850 --> 23:49.887
- As a therapist, I'm
concerned with finding ways

23:49.920 --> 23:52.684
of overcoming resistance.

23:52.730 --> 23:54.698
Not building it up.

23:54.730 --> 23:58.063
- Well, you
built up something,

23:58.100 --> 24:00.489
Dr. Lecter.

24:02.140 --> 24:04.859
(birds chirping)
(camera shutter clicking)

24:06.110 --> 24:08.772
- That was rude, Miss Lounds.

24:08.810 --> 24:12.177
- Did you really think I was
above that sort of thing?

24:12.210 --> 24:14.542
Hm... you seem

24:14.580 --> 24:16.616
disappointed.
- We evolved

24:16.650 --> 24:20.017
the ability to communicate
disappointment to teach
those around us

24:20.050 --> 24:21.984
good manners.

24:22.020 --> 24:25.729
- Unfortunately, I did not
evolve the ability
to feel shame.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.957
- You should explore
that in therapy.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.060
- I saw a psychiatrist once and
it was under false pretenses.

24:32.100 --> 24:36.093
- Happy to entertain you for
a more genuine conversation.

24:36.140 --> 24:38.028
So, What brings you

24:38.070 --> 24:41.938
to the Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane?

24:41.980 --> 24:44.244
- I am interviewing
Will Graham.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.248
At his request.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.044
Imagine that.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.878
- I'm trying.

24:51.920 --> 24:55.253
- Do not pass anything but soft
paper. No pens, no pencils.

24:55.290 --> 24:58.657
Do not accept anything he gives
you. Do not let him touch you.

24:58.690 --> 25:01.124
You do not touch him.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.532
I will be right outside.
- I know the drill.

25:11.940 --> 25:15.239
It's good to see you again,
Will. Let me rephrase that.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.147
It is good to see you in here.
Where you belong.

25:18.180 --> 25:20.045
- Thank you for coming.

25:20.080 --> 25:23.243
- Why am I here?
- I have an admirer.

25:25.350 --> 25:28.183
And he seems to fit
your demographic.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.188
- My demographic

25:30.220 --> 25:32.723
is murderers and people
obsessed with murderers.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.957
- I'm talking about the man
who killed the bailiff
and the judge at my trial.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.594
- Ah.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.636
And you think he's your admirer?

25:45.340 --> 25:48.832
- He killed the bailiff
to give me an alibi.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.848
He killed the judge

25:50.880 --> 25:53.974
because he threw that alibi out.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.739
- So is your admirer crazy?

25:56.780 --> 25:59.840
- I don't think anybody
as careful as he is

25:59.890 --> 26:02.085
could be crazy.
I think--I think he's different.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.850
Maybe a lot of people
believe him to be crazy,

26:04.890 --> 26:07.324
and the reason for that is,
he hasn't let people
understand much

26:07.360 --> 26:10.557
about him.
- But you understand him.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.732
Are you trying to catch him

26:16.770 --> 26:18.761
or contact him?

26:22.780 --> 26:26.102
- I would like to establish
a line of communication.

26:26.150 --> 26:29.039
And your website
seems like a good place

26:29.080 --> 26:31.389
to do that.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.684
- I could open it up for you.

26:33.720 --> 26:36.086
Ads, editorial,

26:36.120 --> 26:39.829
online chat rooms,
monitoring incoming mail.
I could be discreet.

26:39.860 --> 26:43.227
- In exchange for?

26:43.260 --> 26:45.091
- Exclusive rights
to your story.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.247
- It's all yours, Freddie.

27:00.310 --> 27:04.189
- You want to_ talk
to your admirer,

27:04.220 --> 27:06.780
we'll have to send
an imitation.

27:08.790 --> 27:12.419
"Sadly, other killers have drawn
inspiration from Graham.

27:12.460 --> 27:14.826
"As he stood trial for his life,

27:14.860 --> 27:16.953
"one such killer
even constructed an ode

27:17.000 --> 27:19.127
"to Graham's grisly techniques.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.730
"Graham believed this man
wanted to help,

27:21.770 --> 27:23.931
"even though his motives
for that are unclear.

27:23.970 --> 27:25.938
"He killed people in his name,

27:25.970 --> 27:28.939
and he'd like to ask him Why."

27:31.450 --> 27:34.942
- Would you like
a book, Mr. Graham?

27:36.880 --> 27:39.041
- I have my imagination.

27:41.190 --> 27:43.158
- I read your TattleCrime
interview.

27:43.190 --> 27:45.158
You're a very articulate man.

27:45.190 --> 27:48.853
I agreed with a lot
of What you said.

27:48.900 --> 27:52.063
You're right.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.739
People don't
understand much

27:54.770 --> 27:56.829
about me.

27:56.870 --> 27:59.202
Or about you.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.935
But at least

28:00.980 --> 28:03.904
we understand each other.

28:03.950 --> 28:07.044
There's something
we don't have.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.447
Or maybe we just
evolved not to need.

28:12.850 --> 28:15.114
You were hiding
in the FBI.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.857
That's talent.

28:18.890 --> 28:21.120
If you hadn't gotten sick,
they never would've found you.

28:24.430 --> 28:27.092
- You found a great
place to hide.

28:27.130 --> 28:29.098
- Spend time in
a mental hospital,

28:29.140 --> 28:31.108
you pick up the drill.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.233
You could pass
as an orderly,

28:33.270 --> 28:35.238
get a job doing it
when you get out.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.147
They may never
know you were in.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.068
- Obviously you realize

28:40.110 --> 28:42.078
Chilton records
every word said in here.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.179
- Who do you think
Wired the mics?

28:44.220 --> 28:48.111
Or unwired the mics,
as they currently are.
- You killed the bailiff

28:48.160 --> 28:51.527
during my trial.
- I thought it would
exonerate you.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.758
I had read your file
often enough.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.189
Easy to recreate
your work.

28:58.230 --> 29:01.028
It was so specific.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.265
Though the bailiff was a bitch
to get on that stag's head.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.165
- And the judge?

29:05.210 --> 29:07.166
- I killed
the bailiff.

29:07.210 --> 29:09.269
The judge was...

29:09.310 --> 29:11.278
somebody else.

29:11.310 --> 29:14.074
(keys jingling)

29:44.110 --> 29:46.305
- Why are you trying to help me?

29:46.350 --> 29:48.568
- Have you seen the way
that smaller birds

29:48.620 --> 29:50.576
will mob a hawk on a Wire?

29:50.620 --> 29:53.919
You and me, we are
hawks, Mr. Graham.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.814
- Hawks are solitary.

29:55.860 --> 29:58.420
- And that's their weakness.

30:01.030 --> 30:03.965
Enough of those smaller birds
get together, and they chase
hawks away.

30:06.400 --> 30:10.439
Imagine if the hawks
started working together.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.244
Why did you want
to talk to me?

30:20.280 --> 30:23.317
(door unlocking)
- I need a favor.

30:28.020 --> 30:30.011
- I'm always happy to do
a favor for a friend.

30:32.060 --> 30:34.051
Just say the words.

30:42.170 --> 30:44.536
- I want you to kill
Hannibal Lecter.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.391
- Will?

31:46.530 --> 31:48.191
Hi.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.390
- Hi.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.635
- I'm sorry to drop in
unannounced like this.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.935
- What's on your mind,
Dr. Bloom?
- You.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.198
You gave an interview
to Freddie Lounds.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.413
You despise Freddie Lounds.
It just seemed, um...

32:01.450 --> 32:05.284
- What, suspicious?

32:05.320 --> 32:08.380
- And slightly worrying.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.487
- You don't have
to worry about me.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.456
- I know you feel powerless

32:16.500 --> 32:18.718
about What happened to Beverly,

32:18.770 --> 32:21.034
and you want to do
something about it.

32:21.070 --> 32:23.288
- Would that be so bad?

32:23.340 --> 32:25.535
- Depends on What you're
thinking about doing.

32:27.540 --> 32:31.169
But there's no solution
to grief, Will. It just is.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.644
- Beverly died because of me.

32:35.650 --> 32:37.641
Because she listened to me.

32:39.650 --> 32:42.255
I'm not gonna let that
happen again.

32:44.590 --> 32:46.683
- Will, What have you done?

32:51.200 --> 32:53.191
- Just What I had to do.

33:12.050 --> 33:15.156
- What is it about you,
Dr. Bloom?

33:15.190 --> 33:18.125
The most sinister
neurochemistry in the field

33:18.160 --> 33:21.152
cannot help percolating
in your presence.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.294
The interesting ones
all fall at your feet.

33:24.330 --> 33:27.094
Will Graham, Abel Gideon,

33:27.130 --> 33:29.132
they're chatty as can be.

33:29.170 --> 33:31.206
You are like
catnip for killers.

33:31.240 --> 33:34.539
- I see Abel Gideon
has returned to the roost.

33:34.580 --> 33:38.300
- I believe you and I are his
only surviving psychiatrists.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.500
Pulled the tongues
out of all the rest.

33:40.550 --> 33:43.348
- Pulled more than
that out of you.

33:45.150 --> 33:47.482
Have you noticed anything
different about Will

33:47.520 --> 33:49.488
since Gideon arrived?
- Gideon is here

33:49.520 --> 33:53.422
as part of Will's therapy,
helping him reclaim his past.

33:55.530 --> 33:57.498
- Can I see him?

33:57.530 --> 33:59.498
- Dr. Bloom--

33:59.530 --> 34:02.533
You are like a flower
blossoming amongst the weeds.

34:02.570 --> 34:05.334
- I'm glad to see you
alive, Dr. Gideon.

34:05.370 --> 34:07.668
- Well, Mr. Graham didn't do
a particularly good job

34:07.710 --> 34:10.372
of killing me. He was sick.

34:10.410 --> 34:12.776
And a very poor shot.
- Good enough shot

34:12.810 --> 34:15.711
to get a bullet in you
before you put a blade in me.

34:15.750 --> 34:19.345
- And for that,
I am sincerely grateful.

34:19.390 --> 34:23.281
- Been wondering
about that night.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.288
How do you know
Where I live?

34:25.330 --> 34:28.697
- A little birdie
wanted me to kill you.

34:28.730 --> 34:31.858
Or a little birdie
wanted Mr. Graham

34:31.900 --> 34:35.097
to have reason to kill me.
But either way,

34:35.140 --> 34:38.530
you and I are equally
expendable.

34:38.570 --> 34:40.561
- You were trying to find
the Ripper that night.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.602
Did you?
- I found Will Graham.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.505
- Will isn't
the Chesapeake Ripper.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.769
- Not yet.

34:50.750 --> 34:54.652
All the things
that make us who we are...

34:54.690 --> 34:56.510
What has to happen

34:56.560 --> 34:59.620
to make those things change?

34:59.660 --> 35:02.549
So much has happened
to Mr. Graham.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.864
He is a changed man.

35:04.900 --> 35:08.529
- Maybe he's looking
for redemption.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.538
- He's not looking
for redemption.

35:10.570 --> 35:13.607
But revenge,

35:13.640 --> 35:16.768
now that is a trinket
he could value.

35:18.780 --> 35:22.170
- He thinks that he knows
who killed Beverly Katz?

35:22.220 --> 35:25.644
- For the courtesy
you have always shown me,

35:25.690 --> 35:27.749
I am going to give you a gift.

35:27.790 --> 35:29.758
I'm going to give you a chance

35:29.790 --> 35:31.929
to save Will from himself.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.929
- How?

35:34.960 --> 35:38.521
- He is in a biblical
place right now,

35:38.570 --> 35:40.822
but that rage will pass.
And when it does,

35:40.870 --> 35:43.361
Will Graham will either be
a murderer or he will not.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.630
Up to you.

35:45.670 --> 35:47.831
- He's institutionalized.
He's really

35:47.870 --> 35:49.804
in no position to be
killing anyone.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.479
- Not with his own hands.

35:52.510 --> 35:56.571
But if he only had
a little birdie

35:56.620 --> 35:59.487
who could Whisper murder
into a sympathetic ear...

36:01.490 --> 36:03.879
- Who does he want
to kill, doctor?

37:30.340 --> 37:31.841
- He's not here.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.769
- There's nothing
in his calendar.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.744
What is it you think
Will's done?
(phone ringing)

37:37.780 --> 37:41.352
Hold that thought.
This is Jack Crawford.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.915
Yes. Thank you.

37:43.960 --> 37:47.259
We've got a trace
on his cell phone.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.046
- Judas had
the decency

38:47.090 --> 38:49.115
to hang himself in shame
at his betrayal.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.822
But I thought

38:51.860 --> 38:54.749
you needed help.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.951
Did you know that the phrase
"to kick the bucket" came

38:58.000 --> 39:01.993
from exactly this situation?
You could kick it out right now
yourself and it'd all be over.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.463
Quicker than bleeding out.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.771
- You're a nurse
at the hospital.

39:12.510 --> 39:15.843
You're setting a new
standard of care.

39:19.820 --> 39:22.983
Will Graham is not
What you think.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.882
He's not a murderer.

39:26.930 --> 39:29.649
- He is now.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.668
By proxy.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.827
(grunting)

39:33.870 --> 39:35.838
- He asked you to do this?

39:35.870 --> 39:38.088
- What are friends for?

39:40.110 --> 39:42.908
Now I'm going to ask you
a few yes or no questions

39:42.940 --> 39:44.874
While you still have
enough blood coursing
through your brain

39:44.910 --> 39:48.619
to answer them. You ready?

39:48.650 --> 39:51.517
- Ready.

39:51.550 --> 39:55.418
- Did you kill that judge?

39:58.160 --> 40:00.481
I can ask you
yes-or-no questions,

40:00.530 --> 40:02.498
you don't have
to say a word,

40:02.530 --> 40:05.465
and I'll know
What the answer is.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.627
The pupil dilates

40:07.670 --> 40:09.797
with specific
mental efforts.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.661
You dilate, that's a "yes."

40:12.710 --> 40:15.178
No dilation equals "no."

40:18.810 --> 40:21.176
Are you the Chesapeake Ripper?

40:26.890 --> 40:29.188
How many times have you watched
someone cling on to a life

40:29.220 --> 40:31.188
that's not really worth living?

40:31.220 --> 40:35.452
Eking out a few extra seconds.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.219
Wondering why they bother.

40:38.260 --> 40:41.127
- I know Why.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.161
Life is precious.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.020
- The Chesapeake Ripper.

41:14.070 --> 41:16.891
I wonder What
they're gonna call me.

41:16.940 --> 41:19.568
You know, the Iroquois
used to eat their enemies

41:19.610 --> 41:21.601
to take
their strength.

41:23.210 --> 41:26.702
Maybe your murders
will become my murders.

41:28.250 --> 41:30.718
I'll be the Chesapeake
Ripper now.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.615
- Only if you eat me.

41:32.650 --> 41:35.551
(laughing)

41:41.860 --> 41:44.567
- Put your hands
Where I can see them.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.227
- He's got a gun, Jack!

42:04.220 --> 42:06.848
- Hold on!

42:06.890 --> 42:09.279
Hold on, hold on.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.856
Get an ambulance!

42:37.120 --> 42:41.819
