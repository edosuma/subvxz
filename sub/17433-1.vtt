01:05.108 --> 01:06.860
Please don't hurt me!

02:24.477 --> 02:26.604
Oh shit. Thanks. I didn't even see that.

02:26.895 --> 02:27.854
Neither did I.

02:29.690 --> 02:35.029
People say, seeing is believing.
But for me, that's not entirely true.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.696
I lost my sight when I was five years old.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.910
Those memories of what I have seen...

02:40.158 --> 02:44.078
Have faded so much, I doubt that
I'd even recognize myself anymore.

02:44.245 --> 02:46.665
Now I see using my other senses.

02:46.872 --> 02:49.125
I can smell the rain before it drops.

02:49.374 --> 02:50.709
But I can't watch it fall.

02:51.002 --> 02:53.087
I can feel the sun on my face.

02:53.335 --> 02:55.133
But I can't see it rise or set.

02:55.381 --> 02:57.634
I want to see the world like everyone else.

02:57.883 --> 03:01.304
To see the sun, the rain. And music...

03:01.513 --> 03:03.722
I bet music looks beautiful.

04:00.402 --> 04:03.029
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

04:06.492 --> 04:07.367
Taste's good!

04:08.744 --> 04:09.870
Happy Birthday.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.078
Thank you.

04:15.417 --> 04:16.459
Evening Miss Wells!

04:16.709 --> 04:18.627
Hi Miguel, thank you.

04:18.875 --> 04:19.921
You're welcome.

04:21.297 --> 04:22.339
Lilies?

04:22.672 --> 04:23.632
New just this morning.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.554
Myself, I prefer roses.
But you're the first one that's noticed.

04:31.597 --> 04:33.017
Nervous about tomorrow.

04:33.724 --> 04:34.683
No.

04:38.272 --> 04:41.651
Actually... I've never been
so scared in my entire life.

04:42.859 --> 04:48.158
Listen, the night before my mother's
surgery, she drank two glasses of sherry.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.910
Steady as a rock the next day.

04:52.659 --> 04:56.123
- Thank you. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

05:12.970 --> 05:15.431
This is Doctor Haskin's office
calling from County general...

05:15.642 --> 05:18.518
...your procedure is still on schedule
for tomorrow. Be sure to arrive...

05:18.853 --> 05:21.895
...at the hospital four hours before
for pre-op. Thank you.

05:23.231 --> 05:27.735
Hi sweetie, it's your sister.
My flight gets in at 5 am...

05:27.943 --> 05:29.529
The whole crew's got a lay over...

05:29.860 --> 05:32.323
...so I'll find someone to give me a ride
straight to the hospital.

05:33.823 --> 05:34.992
I love you Sydney.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.954
Can't wait to see you. Bye.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.176
12: 10 AM

07:22.344 --> 07:23.305
Hello?

07:23.471 --> 07:24.847
Shh...

07:25.554 --> 07:26.890
Martha will hear you.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.601
She's on from 12 'til 6

07:28.767 --> 07:31.480
And she takes away my M&M's
if I get out of bed.

07:31.687 --> 07:32.731
I'm Alicia.

07:33.271 --> 07:34.563
I'm holding out my hand to shake.

07:35.357 --> 07:36.400
I'm Sydney.

07:36.775 --> 07:38.443
I know, Sydney Wells.

07:38.902 --> 07:42.572
I kinda read your chart.
You're the cornea transplant.

07:42.865 --> 07:43.906
How old are you?

07:44.117 --> 07:49.663
9 and 1/2. There's this like... golf ball thing
inside my head?

07:50.079 --> 07:50.956
It made me so dizzy...

07:51.164 --> 07:54.918
...I couldn't ride my bike.
So the doctor's are trying to get it out.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.253
When do you get to see?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.129
Pretty soon I think.

07:58.631 --> 08:00.090
Good. I'll come back.

08:00.339 --> 08:02.718
- And you can take a look at me.
- Okay.

08:04.677 --> 08:05.971
Bye, nice to meet you.

08:07.053 --> 08:07.973
Bye.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.106
I'm starting to lose the feeling
in my fingers.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.358
Me too.

08:23.821 --> 08:26.948
Ok, if you'll excuse me please.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.368
All right...

08:32.453 --> 08:34.996
All right, Sydney.
I'm going to take the bandages off.

08:35.246 --> 08:35.791
Okay.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.291
- you ready?
- Yeah.

08:50.304 --> 08:51.306
That's one.

08:55.601 --> 09:01.480
That's two... Okay, now I'm going...

09:01.690 --> 09:05.360
...to help you open your eyes.
Very slowly.

09:05.943 --> 09:06.944
Okay.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.909
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

09:20.209 --> 09:21.501
Okay, now tell me what you see.

09:31.384 --> 09:32.592
I can't...

09:34.262 --> 09:35.721
I'm going to hold up my hand.

09:37.054 --> 09:40.894
And I want you to tell me
how many fingers I have up.

09:42.061 --> 09:43.395
Five. Those are fingers.

09:43.856 --> 09:45.106
Yes they are.

09:46.149 --> 09:47.859
All right, here we go.

09:50.068 --> 09:51.236
All of them?

09:51.487 --> 09:54.114
Yes. Very good.

09:56.993 --> 09:58.412
- Sydney...
- Yeah?

09:58.909 --> 10:03.288
I want you to try and reach out
and grab my hand.

10:04.457 --> 10:05.541
Okay?

10:12.298 --> 10:13.882
Okay, it's okay.

10:14.050 --> 10:16.804
Not everybody can do this right away.

10:27.272 --> 10:30.065
It burns a little. Is that normal?

10:30.608 --> 10:31.984
Yes, it's perfectly normal.

10:32.944 --> 10:33.945
Very good.

10:34.112 --> 10:35.197
Thank you.

10:38.950 --> 10:40.700
Am I how you pictured?

10:43.786 --> 10:48.332
I don't know, you're really blurry.

10:51.502 --> 10:53.587
I wish mom and dad were here
to see this.

10:53.798 --> 10:54.756
Yeah.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.470
I think I wanted this more than you,
Sydney.

11:03.056 --> 11:04.973
Not when you were 12.

11:06.141 --> 11:10.980
I waited for this for 15 years.
I thought I'd feel a sense of...

11:11.940 --> 11:13.315
It's sort of like...

11:13.649 --> 11:16.444
It's not your fault. Hey...

11:20.739 --> 11:22.324
It's not your fault.

11:26.371 --> 11:27.662
I'm sorry...

11:28.496 --> 11:32.125
You just need time.
You'll see.

11:39.173 --> 11:41.050
Goodnight. I love you.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.302
I love you too.

11:59.736 --> 12:00.944
Sydney?

12:02.236 --> 12:06.657
Can you see me?
Don't feel bad if you can't.

12:08.578 --> 12:10.077
What's that on your head?

12:10.328 --> 12:12.746
It's a bandana,
my grandpa gave it to me.

12:13.539 --> 12:15.291
You know maybe tomorrow
we can take a walk...

12:15.540 --> 12:17.417
And I can show you the park outside.

12:18.168 --> 12:18.879
The palm trees...

12:19.088 --> 12:19.963
Alicia.

12:20.256 --> 12:21.088
Oh, coming...

12:21.379 --> 12:23.090
Sasquatch, I got to go.

12:24.006 --> 12:24.842
Bye.

12:49.698 --> 12:53.744
Please... I don't want to go...

13:02.961 --> 13:04.379
Mrs. Hillman?

13:16.390 --> 13:17.349
Mrs. Hillman?

13:21.270 --> 13:22.397
Mrs. Hillman.

13:27.860 --> 13:29.194
Where are you taking her?

14:02.185 --> 14:03.185
Mrs. Hillman?

14:26.876 --> 14:28.127
Where are you taking her?

15:02.616 --> 15:07.539
I'm freezing... I'm freezing...

15:09.166 --> 15:10.542
Freezing...

15:11.209 --> 15:12.960
Freezing...

15:13.502 --> 15:16.464
I'm freezing.

15:43.907 --> 15:45.283
Where's Mrs. Hillman.

15:46.199 --> 15:49.580
Oh, I'm sorry.
She passed away last night.

15:58.672 --> 16:04.218
Everything is just perfect.
You are recovering quite nicely.

16:05.261 --> 16:06.553
And the tearing stopped?

16:07.011 --> 16:08.347
I think so, yeah.

16:09.056 --> 16:09.931
Good.

16:14.643 --> 16:16.729
So whose eyes were these?

16:16.939 --> 16:17.813
Excuse me?

16:18.106 --> 16:19.734
My donor?

16:19.984 --> 16:21.567
I'm afraid I can't help you with that,
Sydney.

16:21.818 --> 16:23.361
These are your eyes now,
and they're working.

16:23.610 --> 16:25.197
It shouldn't matter
where they came from?

16:25.822 --> 16:26.572
Does that hurt

16:27.573 --> 16:28.490
A little?

16:29.783 --> 16:30.576
Okay.

16:33.454 --> 16:35.416
When will I be able to see more clearly?

16:36.541 --> 16:40.044
Well it varies with each patient.
Couple of days, couple of weeks.

16:40.378 --> 16:42.797
But your vision itself isn't the issue.

16:43.131 --> 16:47.467
Since you've been blind so long,
I'm going to refer you to a specialist...

16:47.718 --> 16:49.763
...Paul Faulkner, he'll help you.

16:50.136 --> 16:57.101
It's okay, I got it.
All right, have a nice day off tomorrow.

16:57.393 --> 16:58.685
Thanks Sydney.

18:22.141 --> 18:23.143
Hi!

18:23.725 --> 18:24.601
Hey!

18:26.562 --> 18:28.398
Are you ready to be my tour guide?

18:29.398 --> 18:30.441
You're leaving?

18:30.859 --> 18:34.361
Yeah, I'm afraid they've had enough of
me here. This is my sister, Helen.

18:34.653 --> 18:35.613
Helen, this is Alicia.

18:35.779 --> 18:36.570
Hi. Hi.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.783
Hey, can we get a picture together?

18:39.200 --> 18:39.822
Of course.

18:40.032 --> 18:41.493
- Here, I'll do it.
- Okay.

18:49.123 --> 18:52.837
I know you're scared, Sydney, don't be.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.549
The world, it's really beautiful.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.218
Okay, smile.

19:03.430 --> 19:07.977
My carry-on's in the trunk,

19:08.227 --> 19:10.396
And clean, go to some art galleries.

19:12.147 --> 19:14.234
Is it too much for you. Should we...

19:14.484 --> 19:16.069
...pull over or something,
just say the word, okay.

19:16.276 --> 19:19.530
No, no. We can talk everyday,
you can come over and check on me.

19:19.739 --> 19:24.407
I just... think I really need to do this
on my own, okay?

19:24.618 --> 19:26.579
Okay. I understand.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.340
Got some new lamps for your place.

19:38.589 --> 19:39.339
Oh, thanks.

19:39.549 --> 19:40.635
I put them in.

19:41.757 --> 19:44.136
- Here, I'll do it.
- Okay.

19:51.810 --> 19:53.602
Surprise!

19:59.028 --> 20:01.152
This is too soon I know,
I don't know what I was thinking.

20:01.485 --> 20:02.989
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

20:03.529 --> 20:05.865
Do I know any of you?

20:06.199 --> 20:07.116
Welcome home!

20:07.409 --> 20:08.451
Oh hi Jim.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.871
How are you doing? Great to see you.

20:11.203 --> 20:12.163
Nice to see you too.

20:12.371 --> 20:15.332
Sydney, it's Bret. Welcome home!

20:16.000 --> 20:18.419
Hey Syd it's me, Alex, from upstairs.

20:18.670 --> 20:21.170
Oh Alex... Wow, nice to see you.

20:22.132 --> 20:23.674
It's your cousin, Sarah.

20:23.925 --> 20:27.719
Oh Sarah, it's been so long.

20:28.345 --> 20:28.970
I'm so happy.

20:29.263 --> 20:30.429
Recognize my voice.

20:32.141 --> 20:32.974
Oh, hi Cynthia.

20:33.308 --> 20:34.267
How'd you know it was me?

20:34.645 --> 20:36.352
How could I not, Cynthia.

20:36.687 --> 20:37.563
What's up girl?

20:38.229 --> 20:39.315
Oh, Richard!

20:43.110 --> 20:46.820
So, this is what bald looks like.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.823
Hey Sydney. How are you?

20:50.032 --> 20:50.658
- Miguel.
- Yeah.

20:50.867 --> 20:52.533
- How are you?
- you look good.

20:52.827 --> 20:53.994
It's Amanda!

21:11.554 --> 21:13.346
Hey, are you okay,
do you need some water or anything.

21:13.554 --> 21:17.100
Yeah, I'm going to go to the kitchen,
why don't you stay with the guests.

23:20.303 --> 23:22.219
1: 06AM

23:38.109 --> 23:39.193
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.823
Sorry I'm late. That's Henry.

23:46.452 --> 23:47.202
I'm Paul.

23:47.367 --> 23:48.161
Sydney.

23:52.373 --> 23:53.332
Have a seat.

24:08.138 --> 24:09.807
You damaged your corneas
when you were 5?

24:10.100 --> 24:13.227
Yeah, my sister and I
were playing with firecrackers.

24:13.518 --> 24:15.813
I tried a transplant when I was 12...

24:16.061 --> 24:17.145
But I rejected them.

24:17.689 --> 24:22.152
Stem cell research changed the game.
Is that why you tried again?

24:22.401 --> 24:27.323
No, my sister was really the one that
kept up with all that stuff.

24:33.496 --> 24:39.127
These are Doctor Haskin's test results.
There's nothing physically wrong with you...

24:39.460 --> 24:42.130
The operation went flawlessly.
But you're probably in for a shock.

24:42.379 --> 24:43.007
Why?

24:43.255 --> 24:47.385
You already filter information from sound,
smell, touch. But now...

24:48.008 --> 24:52.723
...you're going to be assaulted by a million
things you never even knew existed.

24:53.891 --> 24:56.643
A whole new level of confusion.

24:56.934 --> 25:01.731
Do I look here, or here. Is that bright
thing important or this dark one...

25:02.024 --> 25:05.107
...moving towards me or away from me.
Dangerous or not?

25:05.319 --> 25:09.281
As long as your eyes are open
there's just too many distractions,

25:09.573 --> 25:11.283
I mean, how do you concentrate.

25:11.489 --> 25:13.825
I'm talking to you, and you're...

25:14.117 --> 25:18.374
...looking at that woman. And you're
thinking is she going to eat that.

25:18.705 --> 25:21.001
That's a pineapple by the way.
You cut it open...

25:21.293 --> 25:22.291
I like pineapple.

25:24.793 --> 25:27.590
Anyway, because you can see people...

25:28.006 --> 25:30.008
...you're going to expect people
to do things you can't do.

25:30.218 --> 25:32.136
Read signs, recognize body language.

25:32.468 --> 25:35.639
Recognize facial expressions.
Get out of their way.

25:36.306 --> 25:39.226
Your eyes will want to dominate
how you perceive the world.

25:39.518 --> 25:41.810
But you can't fully trust them. Not yet.

25:42.063 --> 25:45.396
In the next few weeks, I'm going to help you
see the world like it really is, okay?

25:45.648 --> 25:51.111
A lot of it is going to be difficult,
but the main thing is to be prepared.

25:51.403 --> 25:52.613
And that's where I come in.

25:53.865 --> 25:55.616
Okay? We're in this together.

27:30.248 --> 27:31.625
Oh, you scared me.

27:45.680 --> 27:46.638
Hey...

27:46.887 --> 27:48.849
Have you seen my report card?

27:49.849 --> 27:51.269
Your report card?

27:54.897 --> 27:56.105
Do you live here sweetie?

27:56.357 --> 28:01.528
My Father will be so mad at me.
Have you seen my report card?

28:45.154 --> 28:46.071
I'm sorry.

28:47.070 --> 28:48.364
Let's take five.

28:49.489 --> 28:52.785
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

28:53.535 --> 28:54.579
Relax.

28:55.455 --> 28:56.956
You're pushing too hard.

29:10.677 --> 29:13.889
You know when I first went to London
to work with the Philharmonic.

29:14.138 --> 29:18.935
I was so nervous. In Prague,
I was a big fish. In London...

29:19.352 --> 29:20.729
...one of the hundreds.

29:22.187 --> 29:23.690
But you did so well in London.

29:24.982 --> 29:26.986
I never thought I would be ready.

29:27.777 --> 29:32.782
But when it was time to go on,
everything faded away...

29:33.197 --> 29:35.492
It was just me and the music,
face to face.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.913
I wasted so much time being worried.

29:39.204 --> 29:41.122
But there was nothing to worry about.

29:42.833 --> 29:47.003
And now our spring concert series...

29:48.630 --> 29:49.964
...is almost upon us. Sydney?

29:50.214 --> 29:51.174
Will you be ready?

29:51.381 --> 29:52.843
We're all counting on you.

29:55.302 --> 29:56.512
I'll be ready.

29:56.804 --> 29:57.804
I'm sure you'll be.

29:58.723 --> 30:00.017
Number 42!

30:00.433 --> 30:04.728
42, that's us. You sit tight, I'll get it.

30:04.937 --> 30:05.687
Thanks.

30:05.895 --> 30:07.063
42?

30:10.568 --> 30:13.695
Oh I ordered a salad.
Can you change it?

30:13.988 --> 30:14.530
Yes.

30:17.865 --> 30:20.035
You think I'm just going to let you go?

30:21.411 --> 30:23.539
You think I'm not going to do something.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.041
That's it, right?

30:29.128 --> 30:30.587
I'm gonna do it.

30:30.879 --> 30:31.964
I'm sorry?

30:32.254 --> 30:34.174
I told you I was going to do it.

30:39.387 --> 30:40.516
Don't go!

31:01.617 --> 31:04.495
There was a woman, she came at me.

31:05.911 --> 31:09.081
What woman? What woman?

31:11.293 --> 31:13.961
Christ's sake,
get a hold of yourself, please.

31:15.965 --> 31:16.880
Sorry.

31:18.174 --> 31:19.050
I'm sorry.

31:21.843 --> 31:22.928
I apologize.

31:23.221 --> 31:24.181
It's all right.

33:33.844 --> 33:41.560
Well, from the latest results,
there's nothing wrong with your eyes.

33:44.105 --> 33:46.481
Well maybe there's something wrong
with the tests.

33:46.733 --> 33:50.028
Tests only gauge the fact that
you gave no abnormal responses.

33:50.444 --> 33:53.947
Creative ones, yeah,
the kind that artists and musicians give...

33:54.199 --> 33:56.157
...but the last I checked,
you are a musician.

33:57.367 --> 34:00.538
I'm sure other musicians don't see
what I've been seeing.

34:01.287 --> 34:02.288
Come with me.

34:03.874 --> 34:06.961
I'm not an idiot,
I understand what you're telling me.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.755
My brain is having to relearn
how to decode the world around me.

34:10.089 --> 34:13.552
But that's very different from me
seeing things, that don't seem to be real.

34:13.717 --> 34:14.216
How...

34:14.426 --> 34:17.302
Look, you're real...

34:18.012 --> 34:19.181
Okay...

34:19.764 --> 34:21.054
You're here.

34:22.306 --> 34:26.145
My perspective and focus is off, but...

34:26.436 --> 34:29.732
You're real. I can see you.

34:35.989 --> 34:40.658
We see what we look at. But the way that
we see things is affected by what we know...

34:40.992 --> 34:41.619
And there's a lot around you...

34:41.868 --> 34:43.036
That you can't make sense of yet.

34:43.286 --> 34:48.791
What are you saying to me?
You think, I'm making this up?

34:49.958 --> 34:52.418
You think I want this happening to me?

34:52.670 --> 34:54.630
I think you're not going to be able to
push through this...

34:54.965 --> 34:56.132
I think you were better off before...

34:56.380 --> 35:02.347
All special, well you just discovered
you're like the rest of us.

35:02.639 --> 35:03.557
Stop it.

35:05.682 --> 35:07.476
You know when we first met.

35:09.186 --> 35:11.522
I didn't think you were such an ass.

35:12.899 --> 35:14.441
That's because
you didn't know how to spot one.

35:15.650 --> 35:16.652
See...

35:17.067 --> 35:18.279
Progress.

35:26.536 --> 35:27.996
Have a good evening Mrs. Chueng.

35:30.871 --> 35:35.961
Ahh, Miss Wells. Your new TV is here...

35:36.213 --> 35:38.046
...my buddy from the cable company
hooked you up.

35:38.255 --> 35:39.049
Thank you Miguel.

35:39.257 --> 35:41.340
And welcome
to the 200 channel universe.

35:41.592 --> 35:42.342
Thanks.

35:42.593 --> 35:43.803
- Bye.
- Good night.

38:12.526 --> 38:14.571
Hi, this is Helen,
I'm out of town until Saturday...

38:14.821 --> 38:17.656
...so if you need to contact me,
do so after the beep.

38:18.701 --> 38:22.037
Hey, it's Syd. Please call me.

38:36.386 --> 38:37.468
What are you doing!

38:54.861 --> 38:59.281
Call 911! Somebody call 911!

39:04.785 --> 39:05.953
She's not breathing!

40:56.601 --> 40:58.604
Hi, you've reached
the cell phone of Doctor Paul Faulkner...

40:58.980 --> 41:00.104
...leave a message after the beep.

41:01.648 --> 41:09.114
Hi Paul, it's Sydney.
I'm at a Chinese Restaurant...

41:09.405 --> 41:12.116
...at the corner of 4th and Figueroa.

41:14.786 --> 41:16.495
Something's happening to me.

41:19.374 --> 41:24.503
I need you to come, please.

41:44.479 --> 41:45.692
Excuse me.

43:41.967 --> 43:46.681
Sydney, Sydney. It's me! It's me. It's me.

43:52.352 --> 43:53.397
This place...

43:55.605 --> 43:59.943
No, no, no. I was just here...

44:00.194 --> 44:00.901
I was just here.

44:01.029 --> 44:02.653
What are you talking about?

44:02.861 --> 44:03.904
This place...

44:04.157 --> 44:07.951
There was a fire in here, there was a fire
in here weeks ago, five people were killed.

44:08.244 --> 44:10.118
It was in the newspapers,
it was all over the press

44:10.371 --> 44:13.498
- I was just here...
- Hey...

44:16.209 --> 44:17.169
What's wrong?

44:17.376 --> 44:20.379
Everything's wrong. Everything's wrong.

44:20.628 --> 44:22.506
My apartment keeps changing.

44:22.923 --> 44:25.174
It was filled with smoke and
I was attacked...

44:25.510 --> 44:26.386
What do you mean you were attacked.

44:26.760 --> 44:29.095
...by this man... He was on fire then
he was gone. Everything was gone...

44:29.386 --> 44:31.933
So I had to get out of there.
And I was walking down the street...

44:32.223 --> 44:33.141
And...

44:33.392 --> 44:37.188
...this woman walks through me.
She walked right through me!

44:38.064 --> 44:41.023
And I saw the shadow...
I saw it before...

44:41.275 --> 44:44.985
...at the hospital.
It's some kind of escort...

44:45.235 --> 44:48.448
That takes people away when
they're dead.

44:49.032 --> 44:55.496
There's something so angry about them.
They don't want to be seen.

44:57.456 --> 44:58.999
And then, this...

44:59.249 --> 45:00.460
I see people...

45:00.668 --> 45:02.167
...like nothing's wrong.

45:02.880 --> 45:03.920
When they...

45:04.172 --> 45:05.756
...don't seem to see me.

45:06.214 --> 45:07.174
Sydney, listen to me.

45:07.423 --> 45:09.134
I'm seeing things that aren't real.

45:09.386 --> 45:11.843
I'm seeing things that I shouldn't see.

45:12.470 --> 45:15.474
I'm dreaming things, I've never seen.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.519
This surgery was supposed to
make me normal.

45:19.768 --> 45:24.566
Sydney... Your eyes are not the problem.

45:25.152 --> 45:27.609
These eyes are not my eyes.

45:28.070 --> 45:28.901
Yes, they are.

45:29.154 --> 45:33.199
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are!

45:33.449 --> 45:34.534
Listen to me.

45:34.868 --> 45:36.911
You've got a disorder, all right.

45:37.161 --> 45:39.999
We've got to teach your brain
how to separate out...

45:40.330 --> 45:42.334
...these ghost images from the real thing.

45:42.625 --> 45:47.086
You're not listening to me.
I'm not seeing ghost images.

45:49.088 --> 45:49.879
I see...

45:50.088 --> 45:51.592
What? Dead people?

45:52.133 --> 45:54.344
Rooms that change...
Phantom escorts...

45:54.552 --> 45:58.140
Whatever it is that you
believe you're seeing, it's not real!

46:01.559 --> 46:03.227
It's not.

46:05.396 --> 46:06.772
It's not real.

46:07.649 --> 46:09.316
You don't believe me.

46:11.820 --> 46:13.195
I want to help you.

46:13.444 --> 46:14.612
How can you?

46:15.489 --> 46:17.908
How can you, if you don't believe me.

46:55.069 --> 46:56.361
You gettin' on or what?

47:51.289 --> 47:52.540
It's not real...

47:53.042 --> 47:54.084
It's not real...

48:01.090 --> 48:02.090
It's not real...

48:02.340 --> 48:03.759
It's not real...

48:04.051 --> 48:08.472
It's not real...

48:10.599 --> 48:16.314
It's not real...

48:48.971 --> 48:50.804
Have you seen my report card?

48:51.054 --> 48:52.265
Have you seen my report card?

48:52.471 --> 48:54.807
No. I already told you.

48:55.809 --> 48:57.311
Have you seen my report card?

48:57.643 --> 48:58.686
Stop asking me.

49:04.358 --> 49:06.361
No!

49:07.488 --> 49:08.446
No!

49:35.222 --> 49:37.223
Have you seen my report card?

50:38.781 --> 50:43.413
It's your sister Helen,
I'm on my way to the airport. Are you okay?

50:43.704 --> 50:46.872
Will you call me, on my cell,
okay. Please.

50:58.717 --> 51:01.804
You're scaring me sweetie, pick up.

51:03.222 --> 51:07.476
Okay I'm going to call someone, I'm going to
call someone unless you pick up, Sydney.

51:08.435 --> 51:09.393
Sydney?

51:13.024 --> 51:14.192
Miss Wells!

51:14.689 --> 51:17.819
Sydney? It's Paul, are you in there?

51:18.110 --> 51:20.072
The doorman's going to let me in,
all right?

51:40.964 --> 51:42.093
Will you give us a minute.

51:42.427 --> 51:43.344
Sure.

51:54.020 --> 51:57.148
Your sister called, she said
you hadn't answered the phone in days.

52:15.333 --> 52:16.291
What is this?

52:16.835 --> 52:18.044
You want to be blind again?

52:19.794 --> 52:20.461
At least do it right.

52:20.671 --> 52:24.090
When you were blind, you had a life, you
were engaged in a world. You had a job,

52:24.341 --> 52:25.342
what is this?

52:25.716 --> 52:30.056
You get scared and you just drop out.
Run back to your room, turn off the lights.

53:01.377 --> 53:02.754
What now?

53:02.963 --> 53:05.505
I'm going to take you to the hospital and
get this cut sewn up.

53:06.089 --> 53:07.548
Is it really necessary?

53:08.134 --> 53:12.138
Yeah.

53:31.237 --> 53:33.657
I think you should keep her here
over night,

53:33.948 --> 53:35.284
here's my telephone number.

53:50.882 --> 53:55.554
Sydney Wells? You're back?

53:57.596 --> 53:58.764
Alicia?

54:00.265 --> 54:01.768
What are you doing in here?

54:02.018 --> 54:04.060
The golf ball's gone, Sydney Wells.

54:04.396 --> 54:06.147
- What?
- I have to go now.

54:06.355 --> 54:07.356
- Wait. Hang on.

54:09.106 --> 54:10.151
Alicia?

54:21.953 --> 54:24.956
I know you're scared, don't be.

54:25.289 --> 54:27.500
Because the world really is beautiful.

54:34.382 --> 54:35.382
No!

54:35.798 --> 54:36.925
No! Alicia!

54:38.720 --> 54:40.472
Don't go with him!

54:41.639 --> 54:42.850
Alicia!

54:44.101 --> 54:45.268
Alicia!

55:34.688 --> 55:35.942
How are you?

55:42.155 --> 55:43.074
Whatever's happening...

55:43.366 --> 55:45.074
There's nothing that can't be fixed.

55:51.247 --> 55:52.040
Morning.

55:52.790 --> 55:53.791
Morning.

55:54.084 --> 55:54.834
How's the hand.

55:55.002 --> 55:55.875
It's fine.

55:59.171 --> 56:01.465
Alicia's mother wanted you to have this.

56:01.881 --> 56:03.509
Said, she talked about you all the time.

56:03.718 --> 56:05.804
She was smiling up until the very end.

56:14.018 --> 56:15.188
Who is she?

56:16.812 --> 56:18.022
That's you, Sydney.

56:18.357 --> 56:19.524
That's not me.

56:20.233 --> 56:20.817
Of course it is...

56:21.151 --> 56:22.653
...who else would it be.

56:42.045 --> 56:43.254
Sydney...

56:43.839 --> 56:45.217
What are you doing?

56:50.305 --> 56:54.765
Sydney, you're scaring me.

57:05.734 --> 57:06.984
What do you see?

57:14.535 --> 57:16.955
Cellular memory,
based on the theory that all...

57:17.288 --> 57:19.789
...living tissues have the capacity to
remember...

57:20.081 --> 57:23.420
...cellular memory explains
how energy and information...

57:23.669 --> 57:26.420
...from a donor's tissue
can transfer consciously...

57:26.713 --> 57:29.008
...or unconsciously to the recipient.

57:29.299 --> 57:31.758
Recently, recipients of organ transplants...

57:32.050 --> 57:34.888
...have begun to report
episodes of newfound memories...

57:35.098 --> 57:37.265
...thoughts, emotions and characteristics...

57:37.641 --> 57:41.059
...that are often associated to
the original donor

57:41.852 --> 57:42.771
Paul!

57:42.979 --> 57:44.565
Sydney, I can't talk right now,
I have to go to a meeting.

57:44.814 --> 57:47.441
Listen. There's no history of
schizophrenia in my family.

57:47.774 --> 57:51.320
I've never suffered from any mental condition,
not depression, migraines, nothing.

57:51.569 --> 57:54.157
So, for argument's sake
Let's just pretend I'm not crazy.

57:55.366 --> 57:57.283
All right, walk with me then.

57:57.534 --> 58:00.203
There have been cases of transplant
recipients who've actually showed...

58:00.494 --> 58:01.455
...characteristics of the donor.

58:01.663 --> 58:02.956
Right. Cellular Memory.

58:03.497 --> 58:06.460
There was a liver transplant patient
in Kentucky last year...

58:06.834 --> 58:09.088
...that almost immediately felt
the urge to pick up smoking.

58:09.462 --> 58:10.631
A health nut all her life.

58:10.798 --> 58:12.007
The donor was a chain smoker.

58:12.299 --> 58:13.300
Down to the same brand.

58:14.008 --> 58:16.678
And a few years ago this little girl helped
the police solve the murder of the person

58:17.054 --> 58:17.761
she got her heart from.

58:18.011 --> 58:22.185
She kept having visions of the crime.
There's some kind of chemical... It's...

58:22.392 --> 58:23.141
Peptides.

58:23.517 --> 58:24.727
It's how the mind and body communicate.

58:24.894 --> 58:28.815
So it's not too big a leap to suggest memories
can be accessed from these organs, too...

58:29.022 --> 58:30.691
No, because corneas aren't
a major organ,

58:31.024 --> 58:32.109
it's like changing the windshield of a car.

58:32.316 --> 58:34.360
But there's still a chance isn't there?

58:36.696 --> 58:39.824
I... I need that chance.

58:41.159 --> 58:43.288
I need to find out who the donor was.

58:43.994 --> 58:46.039
I see her in the mirror every day.

58:46.747 --> 58:48.958
I have to find out who she was.

58:52.628 --> 58:55.090
That is confidential information.

58:55.465 --> 59:00.762
You can't ask me to do that.
I could lose my license.

59:02.889 --> 59:04.182
Your license...

59:06.516 --> 59:07.933
Well by all means...

59:08.185 --> 59:09.729
...hold onto that license.

59:35.627 --> 59:37.505
Sydney?

59:39.716 --> 59:40.882
Sydney, come on.

59:50.434 --> 59:51.435
Thank you.

59:52.102 --> 59:52.771

01:00:14.373 --> 01:00:15.250
Excuse me.

01:00:16.501 --> 01:00:17.542
Sorry.

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:20.630
Thank you.

He's here, isn't he

01:00:34.977 --> 01:00:36.145
My Tomi.

01:00:42.148 --> 01:00:43.317
What was that about?

01:00:48.072 --> 01:00:49.282
Who's Tomi?

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.160
Her son.

01:00:54.161 --> 01:00:55.246
Where was he?

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080
He's dead.

01:02:24.997 --> 01:02:26.374

What do you want?

01:02:34.632 --> 01:02:35.883
I want to help you...

01:02:37.093 --> 01:02:37.967
...but how can I...

01:02:38.258 --> 01:02:39.806
...if you won't tell me.

01:03:30.478 --> 01:03:33.939
Sydney, are you okay?

01:03:34.396 --> 01:03:35.608
Sydney, open up.

01:03:35.983 --> 01:03:36.941
Open up!

What the Hell is going on!

01:03:42.323 --> 01:03:43.114
I need to find out who she is!

01:03:43.364 --> 01:03:45.032
- Who?
- My donor!

01:03:45.408 --> 01:03:46.786
Her eyes, my eyes!

01:03:47.118 --> 01:03:48.120
I've seen what she saw!

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:49.622
I'm seeing what killed her.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:50.790
Sydney, please...

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.082
Helen, don't!

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.334
I love you,
but there's no way you can help me.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:56.794
You're not making sense.

01:03:57.087 --> 01:04:02.090
It's all happening to me. Everything that
happened to her, is happening to me.

01:04:02.884 --> 01:04:05.260
Until I find out who she is...

01:04:06.721 --> 01:04:09.890
And what she wants...
it's going to keep happening.

01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:26.407

...cornea transplant that
matches the date of your surgery...

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:51.011
...came from a Clinica Saint Javier,
Los Llanos.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.015
Your donor was from Mexico.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.226
Do you get car sick?

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:58.978
Why?

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.105

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.950
Thank you.

01:05:26.336 --> 01:05:29.340
The file says your donor was
Anna Christina Martinez.

01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:32.593
One living relative, mother.
Worked in a ceramics factory.

01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:34.721
Hopefully we can track her down.

01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:41.394
So what made you change your mind?

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:43.605
About what?

01:05:45.231 --> 01:05:47.231
About coming down here with me?

01:05:47.605 --> 01:05:50.987
Can't you just let me sabotage
my career in peace.

01:05:51.278 --> 01:05:54.072
I was just wondering why
you changed your mind, that's all.

01:05:57.159 --> 01:05:58.702
Is it because you believe me?

01:06:22.433 --> 01:06:23.476
Paul, stop the car.

01:06:31.108 --> 01:06:32.066
What do you see?

01:06:32.777 --> 01:06:35.779
There was a fire here.
I keep seeing fire.

No. But many others did.

they would have been saved.

Did Anna ever see things
she couldn't explain.

Do you see things?

Why would they blame her?

01:12:03.091 --> 01:12:05.178
One time when she was a little girl.

01:12:05.637 --> 01:12:08.679
She would sit in front of
the person's house and she...

01:12:09.014 --> 01:12:12.517
...would just cry. And soon after...

01:12:12.808 --> 01:12:14.769

...she wasn't bringing death to anyone.

But she could just...

...see death.

01:22:55.132 --> 01:22:56.548
All right, come on,
let's get back in the car.

01:22:58.216 --> 01:22:59.719
Come on, you're scaring the little girl,
let's go.

01:22:59.802 --> 01:23:00.636
Wait.

01:23:02.262 --> 01:23:03.555
Look at her,
you're scaring the Hell out of her.

01:23:03.889 --> 01:23:05.474
Let's get back in the car, now.
Come on.

01:23:08.267 --> 01:23:09.269
What?

01:23:14.023 --> 01:23:14.899
Oh God!

01:23:19.153 --> 01:23:20.279
Sydney!

01:23:23.115 --> 01:23:24.158
Sydney!

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.160
Sydney!

01:23:32.502 --> 01:23:34.667
Sorry man, are you all right? All right...

01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:40.091
I see the shadows! They're everywhere!

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:42.550
Excuse me! Excuse me please!

01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:43.552
Open up!

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:44.720
Open up please!

01:23:44.929 --> 01:23:45.429
What is going on!

01:23:45.639 --> 01:23:47.473
There's going to be a accident,
we don't have a lot of time.

01:23:47.764 --> 01:23:49.684
Please, just let me talk to the driver,
okay!

01:24:06.949 --> 01:24:08.034
Oh my God!

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:20.754
Don't you understand!
This is what she wanted me to see.

01:24:21.131 --> 01:24:24.175
Everything I dreamed wasn't from
Anna's life, it was from this...

01:24:24.467 --> 01:24:28.262
Right now! She let me see that this was going
to happen, so I wouldn't end up like her.

01:24:28.512 --> 01:24:30.348
She wants me to save these people!

01:24:32.599 --> 01:24:33.975
That's what she wants me to do.

01:24:34.434 --> 01:24:37.811
You have to believe me.
You have to believe me.

01:24:53.412 --> 01:24:55.330
You need to get off this bus.

01:24:55.662 --> 01:24:57.497
Everyone needs to get off this bus.

01:24:59.082 --> 01:25:01.334
All of you! You can't stay here!

01:25:03.754 --> 01:25:05.713
Everyone has got to get off this bus!

01:25:06.215 --> 01:25:07.466
You need to get off this bus, right now!

01:25:07.798 --> 01:25:08.424
Is it like a terrorist thing?

01:25:08.676 --> 01:25:09.383
- Yes!
- Get up...

01:25:09.674 --> 01:25:10.344
- That's exactly...
...what it is!

01:25:10.677 --> 01:25:11.512
There's a bomb on the bus!

01:25:11.886 --> 01:25:16.476
There's a bomb! Run! Move it!

01:25:18.059 --> 01:25:21.646
Run, come on, get out of the car!

01:25:21.938 --> 01:25:24.815
Come on, get out!

01:25:25.107 --> 01:25:27.817
In the car... Run! Go!

01:25:28.277 --> 01:25:34.869
Out of your car!

01:25:36.703 --> 01:25:38.829
Wait here, sweetie.

01:25:46.336 --> 01:25:47.088
Mom!

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.713
Run! There's a bomb!

01:25:48.962 --> 01:25:51.216
Run, get out of your cars!

01:25:53.551 --> 01:25:55.427
Get those people out of there right now!

01:25:55.846 --> 01:25:56.636
Get out of the car!

01:25:57.054 --> 01:25:58.473
Come on, you got to get out of the car!

01:26:06.187 --> 01:26:06.856
Come on!

01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:11.316
Go, go, go!

01:26:14.988 --> 01:26:16.324
Help me! Mom!

01:26:17.324 --> 01:26:18.783
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you all right?

01:26:19.075 --> 01:26:20.994
Get my daughter! She's inside.

01:26:24.998 --> 01:26:25.832
Open the door!

01:26:26.042 --> 01:26:27.584
How! Please!

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.295
Help me!

01:26:33.381 --> 01:26:34.341
Help!

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:36.091
- Paul!
- Help!

01:26:37.468 --> 01:26:40.219
Stand back, I'm going to break the window!
Close your eyes!

01:26:41.221 --> 01:26:42.140
Stand back!

01:26:43.266 --> 01:26:44.726
- Hurry!
- Stand back!

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:50.021
Come here, honey!

01:26:53.065 --> 01:26:54.945
Paul, let's go

01:26:56.487 --> 01:26:58.948
Hurry up! Run!

01:26:59.322 --> 01:27:00.866
Come on! Run! Run! Ru

01:27:43.155 --> 01:27:44.532
You saved them Sydney.

01:27:45.782 --> 01:27:47.159
You saved them Sydney.

01:27:49.037 --> 01:27:50.288
You saved them...

01:27:59.589 --> 01:28:04.301
Some say, seeing is believing.
Now I know what they mean.

01:28:04.508 --> 01:28:10.473
Anna Christina tried to prevent death.
But she was ultimately powerless to stop it.

01:28:10.682 --> 01:28:14.354
Anna and I shared both a blessing
and a curse.

01:28:28.658 --> 01:28:33.119
I know, now, I don't need eyes
to see what truly matters.

01:28:33.494 --> 01:28:37.373
The gift of Anna's sight made me see
what I was afraid to.

01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:38.208
To use...

01:28:38.541 --> 01:28:41.004
...that vision to not only save myself
and others...

01:28:41.253 --> 01:28:43.213
But to give Anna the peace...

01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:45.048
...that she never found in life.
