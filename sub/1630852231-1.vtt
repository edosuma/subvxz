johnny: Whoa. Look at this.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.816
Oh, my god.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.686
That's, that's grizzly
bear hair right there.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.988
Look up here.

00:24.058 --> 00:27.559
How powerful.
It just shred through this.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.129
This tree is gonna be dead.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.031
But it's not,
which tells me that this

00:32.066 --> 00:33.766
is pretty, pretty fresh.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.235
You know this happened
semi-recently.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.405
I'm not the only one in
this neighborhood hunting.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.149
Johnny: Just more sheds.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.785
If all else fails,
caribou should be around.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.120
It's a good sign.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.955
It's really good
to see, you know,

00:56.991 --> 00:59.825
what's in the neighborhood.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.533
This is the arctic and
it's a very unforgiving place.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.502
I'm in a new territory.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.004
This is new land for me.

01:12.039 --> 01:15.307
It's important that I secure
some food for, for the winter.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.377
The stakes are a little
bit higher here in alaska.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.679
The odds are against me.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.383
There's a lot of challenges
that will be coming my way,

01:24.418 --> 01:27.753
but I, I feel like
I'm living the life that

01:27.788 --> 01:30.055
I was born to live.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.458
My name is johnny rolfe.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.027
I grew up right
outside chicago.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.263
I spent as much time
as I could outside,

01:38.332 --> 01:41.567
running around a cornfield,
the neighborhood forest.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.769
It was hard to keep me inside.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.639
I moved out to
seattle for a job.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.442
I worked at a three
michelin-star restaurant.

01:50.478 --> 01:54.713
But the city, it's a
cold depressing place
for me is how I felt.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.449
<i> Narrator: Several months ago,</i>

02:13.000 --> 02:15.667
Johnny: It's a moose scat,
but it's a little old.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.937
But, you know, if there was
a moose here at one time,

02:18.973 --> 02:22.141
there's probably a
moose here again.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.977
Let's keep, keep moving.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.947
This is the first
time I'm actually going
out and exploring.

02:28.983 --> 02:32.151
Any ground I cover
today is new.

02:32.386 --> 02:35.420
My goal overall is
to be self-reliant.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.156
I need to be prepared.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.357
This is my food.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.159
This is what's carrying
me through the winter.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.561
It's moose and caribou
season right now.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.130
It's such a short
window of opportunity,

02:45.166 --> 02:46.798
it's going to be a
lot of work for me.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.801
But I'm not looking
for an easy out here.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.641
Seeing a lot more caribou
sign and I'm open to either.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.776
I'm not just out here for moose.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.512
I'm gonna capitalize on
any of those opportunities.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.382
Although it's open season
for moose right now,

03:03.417 --> 03:05.784
caribou's on the list as well.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.886
I have to bring meat home.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.455
And if I don't, well then,
I'm just not going to make it.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.527
Jessi: There's three things
that are important out here,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.863
and that's food,
shelter, and water.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.267
We need all three of those,
absolutely, to survive out here.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.807
That's right, you're gonna
show me those mushrooms.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.679
Chris: Fall in the cosna is
about the best time out here,

03:33.714 --> 03:36.114
but every season out
here has its troubles.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.016

03:51.865 --> 03:54.366
Chris: Water's always a
complicated issue out here.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.435
We got a lot of brush.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.703
It's a deep bank.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.404
There's a lot of bears
this time of the year,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.506
and it's got parasites,
so you have to filter it and

04:01.542 --> 04:03.008
you have to boil it.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.476
So, you're always
trying to be careful,

04:04.511 --> 04:06.011
you're always
trying to watch it.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.446
There it is.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.348
Oh, don't let it,
you're holding me down.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.749
You're holding me down!

04:11.418 --> 04:13.252
We're always fighting
some kind of danger trying

04:13.287 --> 04:14.820
to get water.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.588
Jessi: This way.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.158
Chris: There should be a,

04:20.194 --> 04:21.627
like a swamp pole out
here somewhere that

04:21.662 --> 04:22.995
I'm looking for.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.630
Today we're gonna go
wander around and we're going

04:24.665 --> 04:26.932
to see if we can find a
good spot to put a well in.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.501
But to get a well
in to the ground you
got a bunch of pipe,

04:29.536 --> 04:31.903
and you've got
yourself a driving point.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.873
This pitcher pump
styles that you've seen
it all the camp grounds,

04:34.908 --> 04:36.742
that's what we're
using for a well head.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.278
Jessi: It's all
looking pretty dry.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.579
Chris: Yeah, if you start
walking along and you start

04:40.614 --> 04:42.981
seeing like water come
up where we're stepping,

04:43.017 --> 04:45.884
we'll try digging there
and see what it looks like.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.586
Let's just keep on cruising.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.889
Jessi: Kind of
swampy up in here.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.158
Chris: All right, I can feel
it underneath me squishing.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.061
Jessi: Oh, I can hear it.
Chris: Yeah.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.829
Not only can I hear
the water under my feet,

04:57.865 --> 04:59.598
but I can actually see
it squish up and around

04:59.633 --> 05:00.666
my rubber boots.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.768
To me that's a
really good sign.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.037
Here we go.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.572
Let's see how deep this is.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.876
But, I mean, this is
a pretty big muck hole.

05:10.911 --> 05:14.513
To me, seeing water
here and digging into the
ground and seeing water,

05:14.548 --> 05:16.448
I feel like this might
be our best chance.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.016
Jessi:
Wouldn't that be amazing?

05:18.052 --> 05:20.752
This tiny little hole
actually has like a spring or

05:20.788 --> 05:23.155
something underneath it.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.756
Chris: Give it a try?

05:24.792 --> 05:27.092
Jessi: I think
this is the spot.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.730
Brittany: Living out here,

05:31.799 --> 05:33.432
everyone has to
learn to hunt for food.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.500
It's necessary for us
to learn these skills.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.502
To be able to provide
my family with,

05:37.538 --> 05:39.538
with meat for the year.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.613
Kaleb: We are heading
out moose hunting.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.183
It's overnight camping
up to a high ridge.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.718
We really need to get a moose.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.386
Our freezer's empty.

05:54.421 --> 05:55.954
We're gonna leave
the kids up at grandma

05:55.989 --> 05:57.356
and grandpa's house.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.924
I get to bring my wife,

05:58.959 --> 06:01.526
who I have never actually
gone hunting with,

06:01.795 --> 06:03.729
so this will
be a first for us.

06:05.165 --> 06:08.200
Brittany: Okay.
You ready for some practicing?

06:08.235 --> 06:09.534
Kaleb: Yeah, this
looks like a good spot.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.303
Brittany: Yeah?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.004
Shall we shoot these jugs?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.139
Kaleb: Yeah.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.274
Those looks like about the
size of, of a moose liver.

06:16.310 --> 06:18.343
Brittany: Moose liver.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.412
Kaleb: My name
is kaleb rowland.

06:20.447 --> 06:21.847
I live in mccarthy, alaska

06:21.882 --> 06:23.448
with my wife, brittany,
and two children,

06:23.484 --> 06:25.117
gilbert and elovie.

06:25.152 --> 06:29.254
I really do enjoy
life out here with my
wife and my children.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.022
I grew up out here.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.693
Being able to go do whatever
you want, whenever you want.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.995
I need a shop built...

06:38.332 --> 06:39.531
I just do it.

06:39.566 --> 06:43.168
My kids have the freedom
out here to just roam.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.604
This is a beautiful
place to enjoy.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.705
I'm just happy.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.341
I'm content with
where my life is now.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.743
So, who's going first?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.478
Brittany: I think
I wanna shoot first.

06:53.514 --> 06:56.047
I think if I see
yours go kaboom,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.750
I'm going to chicken
out on shooting.

06:59.686 --> 07:03.622
Shooting a gun is both
exciting and thrilling and

07:03.657 --> 07:05.457
also a little bit terrifying.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.626
The last time I shot a gun
was about 10 years ago.

07:07.995 --> 07:08.994
(gunshot)

07:09.997 --> 07:11.196
kaleb: Okay.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.864
You wanna have it up
on your shoulder here,

07:12.900 --> 07:14.666
and then you wanna, yeah.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.301
Brittany: While kaleb
usually goes out to hunt,

07:16.336 --> 07:19.037
I've been busy raising
my babies at home.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.939
(gunshot)

07:22.743 --> 07:24.743
well, this time,
I'm going with him because

07:24.778 --> 07:25.811
it's hunting season.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.380
You only have a short
window to actually be able

07:28.415 --> 07:30.182
to hunt a moose.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.318
We have to do it now or we
won't have meat for the year.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.589
Being able to provide for
our family, and also have,

07:37.624 --> 07:39.724
essentially, a couple
days of a date night,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.927
we're very excited about that.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.097
We need to start the winter
off with a full freezer.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.100
Michael: I'm just
like a kid sometimes.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.903
I just keep curiously
wanting to push forward.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.606
What's around the next bend?
What's around the next bend?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.008
Until finally, I make
it to my destination.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.746
I gotta confirm the zero
on my small game gun.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.648
I can use it for camp food.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.217
I've shot rough grouse,

08:05.252 --> 08:07.252
spruce grouse,
snowshoe hare, beaver.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.889
I've put away a lot of
food with this little gun.

There's my group right
there and I'm hitting black.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.544
Time to get up the river.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.285
You know, every time
I head out hunting,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.554
I always like to
see new territory.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.656
I can't remember the
last time I've hunted the

08:44.691 --> 08:46.758
same river twice.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.728
Back in 2010 when I got back
from my third one-year tour

08:49.763 --> 08:53.198
in the iraq war,
I was pretty jaded.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.168
It was a harsh time to be me
and it was a harsh time for

08:57.204 --> 08:59.337
people to be close to me.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.407
And I come out here.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.409
This place, it'll humble you.

09:04.845 --> 09:08.313
It reminds you that no matter
how chaotic the world can be,

09:08.348 --> 09:12.150
the man-made fabricated world,
this landscape will always be

09:12.185 --> 09:14.553
uncomplicated and beautiful.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.290
The hard day on the
river is better than a

09:18.325 --> 09:20.258
great day in the city.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.229
We made it all the
way down here to the mouth

09:24.264 --> 09:26.498
of the nation river.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.801
This is a small, technical,
troublesome river.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.604
And this is the way I like it.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.372
Keeps you on your toes.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.175
We got this cut
bank right here.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.079
Dang.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.783
This cottonwood is just
blocking the whole darn river.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.858
That sucker
threatens to capsize

09:53.927 --> 09:56.061
everything I've earned.

09:56.563 --> 09:59.464
I'm gonna go ahead
and pull over here.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.336
And that's blocking
the whole river flow.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.306
I'm gonna go ahead
and check this out,

10:08.342 --> 10:10.408
see if I can get this
boat around this.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.710
Holy (bleep)!

10:11.745 --> 10:14.012
This water is swift.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.047
I could barely walk out here.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.218
But I have enough depth
here, almost up to my knees,

10:20.253 --> 10:22.621
where I can run my boat right
up against the side of this

10:22.656 --> 10:26.024
sweeper and try like
heck to get around it.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.793
But I gotta cut hard
and I gotta cut quick to

10:28.829 --> 10:31.896
get around this shoal.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.532
These sweepers, sitting
there like that with all this

10:34.568 --> 10:37.002
rushing water up
underneath it,

10:37.037 --> 10:40.171
threatens to tangle
you up and capsize you.

I hope I don't encounter
any more sweepers like that.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.185
Oh, man, that's a
perfect camp spot.

11:30.190 --> 11:34.893
This right here,
this sandy stuff always
leaves a signature.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.096
Right here is a wolf track.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.433
There's a creek over here,
so I'm going to walk around

11:41.468 --> 11:43.768
all the sand and just
keep my eyes peeled,

11:44.237 --> 11:46.004
see what I can see.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.473
Big wolf.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.012
Moose.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.383
There's a nipped
willow and it regrew.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.319
It tells me that there
are cows, calves,

12:01.354 --> 12:04.289
possibly a young bull,
feeding around this area.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.661
I see a big load of
willow brush right here,

12:09.696 --> 12:12.063
piled up here by the beavers.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.600
So, I'm liking this spot.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.870

12:18.905 --> 12:20.438
And I don't have
no time to waste.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.707
Got a big job ahead of me.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.479
Kaleb: Alaska forces me
to overcome weakness.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.114
Because you adapt
and overcome to whatever

12:29.149 --> 12:30.882
situation you're in.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.425
Kaleb: I think this looks like
a great place to put our tent.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.826
We'll have a little bit
of a view.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.061
Brittany: Yeah.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.163

12:47.768 --> 12:51.069

we have us a home.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.918
It's got our moose call.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.687
It's got our emergency gear.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.657
Brittany: Does the moose call,
isn't that like cheating?

13:13.460 --> 13:14.959
Kaleb: No.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.162
Basically, you're
just convincing the moose
that you're a hot date.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.931
Brittany: Well, I guess
that's what everyone does on,

13:19.966 --> 13:21.366

13:23.670 --> 13:25.470
Kaleb: Yup.

Love you.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.854
Kaleb: Love ya.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.924
Brittany: Do you want a kiss?
Kaleb: I always want a kiss.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.193
Brittany: Bye.
Kaleb: Will see ya.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.132
Growing up out here, hunting
has always been a really

13:54.167 --> 13:55.667
important part of our life.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.036
It's been a part of me since
as long as I can remember.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.242
I always love that feeling
of "it's moose season now."

14:04.477 --> 14:06.411
time to go hunt.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.780
(animal call)

14:11.785 --> 14:15.119
johnny: I like to exercise
my pioneer spirit and

14:15.155 --> 14:17.789
I like to go explore places
that people have never been.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.626
That, to me, is adventure.
It's living life.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.297
Johnny: Just kinda snacking
and grazing as I go.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.100
I'm not out here
hunting blueberries,

14:29.135 --> 14:31.202
I'm out here hunting moose,
so I gotta get moving.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.509
When I was 10 years old
I, I got a national park

14:38.545 --> 14:42.947
picture book and
all these parks looked
so awesome in there,

14:43.250 --> 14:45.350
but as soon as I went
to the alaska page,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.819
it was profound.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.788
I said,
"I need to get there, I belong."

14:52.425 --> 14:54.659
yeah. It's a grizzly.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.062
He's hungry. So am I.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.831
We're getting close
to the river.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.367
I, I, it's gotta be
somewhere up here and I know

15:02.402 --> 15:05.069
that bears like to
hang out by the rivers.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.438
The river that I'm
walking to is the, kind of,

15:07.474 --> 15:09.173
the ultimate
goal of this trip.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.942
It's something that
I'd been wanting to walk to

15:10.977 --> 15:12.877
since coming out here.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.280
I've hunted quite
a bit in my time.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.216
But I've actually
never hunted out here in
alaska for large game.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.287
In order to be successful,
I just have to apply my hard

15:22.322 --> 15:25.924
work ethic and any skill
set that I have learned.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.092
It's going to be a
tough winter otherwise.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.364
I'm tired, I'm a little wet,
I'm hungry, but I made it.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.202
More beautiful than I
thought it would be.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.974
There's all, all sorts of
different tracks in here,

15:43.009 --> 15:45.076
I see moose tracks,
I see a bear print,

15:45.111 --> 15:47.312
but it's awesome seeing
these wolf tracks.

15:47.914 --> 15:51.082
It's important for me
to know my competition.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.518
We're competing for
the same food source.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.321
So, if they're here
that means they're fed.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.690
So, if they can get fed,
all I have to do is find

15:58.725 --> 16:00.892
the animal so I can get fed.

16:05.432 --> 16:09.767
Rivers here are,
are essentially the
veins of the land.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.272
There's life and it's
pulsing through them.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.241
It's, it's majestic.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.379
You know, I'm pretty,
pretty stoked about
this location because I,

16:21.414 --> 16:25.016
it's just a giant
playground for me to explore

16:25.251 --> 16:27.218
and everywhere I go
there's something that

16:27.253 --> 16:29.387
grabs my attention.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.622
You know, animal signs,
plant life.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.124
I saw a wolf sign.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.159
I saw a lot of
grizzly bear sign.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.528
And just because I didn't
see a caribou or moose today,

16:37.564 --> 16:39.564
it doesn't mean that I
won't see one tomorrow.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.633
I just gotta keep
trying and keep at it.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.536
I am walking home
empty-handed.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.172
It's a little
bittersweet for me.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.576
The river was the most
beautiful place that I've seen

16:51.611 --> 16:55.380
since I've been out here.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.950
One thing I've learned about
myself is I'm very observant.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.219
When I come out to nature
there's noises and there's

17:01.254 --> 17:02.820
sights to be seen.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.089
Birds, animals,
beautiful sunsets,

17:05.125 --> 17:06.391
mountains and landscapes.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.394
This is stuff
that I wanna see.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.065
Caribou right there.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.336
When I'm living in a city,
it's the exact same thing.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.837
I notice everything around me.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.440
I hear every car honk,
I hear every door shut,

17:22.976 --> 17:25.376
ads, buy this, buy that.

17:28.415 --> 17:32.517
It, it's, it drains me.
It absolutely drains me.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.720
So, I moved to alaska.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.755
So I found a place
where I'm at peace.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.684
We haven't had fresh
water out here in years.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.920
Everything we get for water
is either harvested from

19:15.955 --> 19:18.823
a dirty lake or coming
out of a funky river.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.826
I'd love for some
clean groundwater.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.795
Nice.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.464
I've got my sand-point.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.799
It's about a three-foot-long
chunk of metal with some mesh

19:28.835 --> 19:30.301
screen inside of it.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.204
And what that's gonna
do is as the sand and
rocks pack up against it,

19:33.239 --> 19:35.273
it's gonna filter that out
and hopefully give us some

19:35.308 --> 19:37.608
nice, clean water.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.812
Just stick this,
you know, up on there.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.016

get it set into the ground.

We don't wanna get the well

19:54.360 --> 19:55.560

Jessi:
We're gonna do this, love.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.655
Michael:
I enjoy new territory.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.290
You always
learn something new.

22:39.325 --> 22:40.691
Will they be easy miles?
I don't know.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.727
But that's the great
mystery of life.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.638
Michael: I see a couple of
beavers swimming around.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.008
Now that I got my
tent all packed up,

22:58.044 --> 22:59.910
I need a fresh
load of camp meat.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.712
This might be the
perfect opportunity.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.948
I'm gonna go ahead,
drop this stuff in my tent,

23:03.983 --> 23:05.015
jump in the boat,

23:05.051 --> 23:06.417
scoot over there across
the river and see if

23:06.452 --> 23:08.386
I can't get a beaver.

23:09.055 --> 23:12.022
Beaver meat is a
very rich fatty meat,

23:12.058 --> 23:13.357
just super food.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.525
It really is.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.794
These animals,
they work non-stop.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.830
You see these caches of
willow brush that they stash.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.533
They're just
hard-working animals.

23:22.835 --> 23:26.036
And that food, it really
does give you a boost of

23:26.072 --> 23:28.239
energy out here.

23:28.274 --> 23:30.274
I've been keeping my
eyes on that pile of willow

23:30.309 --> 23:32.843
that them beaver
been putting away.

23:32.879 --> 23:35.379
And now that it's
getting close to evening,

23:35.415 --> 23:37.415
I see more activity
over there.

23:37.817 --> 23:41.285
This is a good camp.
A lot of resources here.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.631
I just spooked a
beaver off the pile.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.200
I'm gonna let the
beaver settle in and

23:56.235 --> 23:58.169
I'm just gonna wait.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.248
(splash)

24:12.051 --> 24:13.250
(gunshot)

24:14.454 --> 24:16.053
wee bit of a miss.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.922
It went right over
the top of his head.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.857
Moving animal.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.826
Little too far away.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.261
I've seen about three
or four beavers contributing

24:24.297 --> 24:26.263
to this pile.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.466
Oh, there he is.

24:29.335 --> 24:30.935
Son of a beaver.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.108
(gunshot)

24:41.247 --> 24:42.513
right over there.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.382
There's a beaver right there.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.122
(gunshot)

24:53.159 --> 24:56.060
all right.
I hit him perfectly.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.202
He hasn't resurfaced.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.939
Shot him once,
hit him clean.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.941
Dove back down under water.
I lost him.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.085
Hit him clean,
he dove back down underwater.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.287
I lost him.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.723
That's very discouraging
to wound a beaver.

25:27.593 --> 25:30.427
It's a valuable,
valuable animal.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.863
Food and fur for mitts.

25:33.266 --> 25:36.200
But the only thing
I can do now is try to get

25:36.235 --> 25:39.069
over my discouragement.

25:39.672 --> 25:42.406
It's been a long day,
so maybe I might try again

25:42.441 --> 25:44.608
tomorrow for some camp meat.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.511
These animals, and
they're kind of reminiscent

25:47.547 --> 25:48.979
of this landscape.

25:49.015 --> 25:52.016
It's a really harsh
place all year long.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.118
And just put yourself
in that beaver's paws.

25:54.153 --> 25:58.155
Think about if you took a
bullet and you were with the

25:58.190 --> 26:01.492
program enough to continue
to fight for your life.

26:02.094 --> 26:05.629
And I respect these
animals in the utmost.

26:06.232 --> 26:11.569
The sorrowful
possibility of crippling
an animal and losing it,

26:11.604 --> 26:14.705
it is a really
hard thing to digest.

26:18.511 --> 26:20.778
Today might not be my day.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.547
Wait. Wait.
There is a leg.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.652
That's gotta be my
beaver right there.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.887
There it is.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.056
I got discouraged.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.658
And there it is,
that big beaver finally
let loose right here.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.494
Finally gave way.

26:37.530 --> 26:39.597
Oh, my goodness,
that's a big one!

26:39.632 --> 26:41.632
(grunts)

26:42.335 --> 26:44.501
I'm gonna go ahead and head
back to camp and skin this,

26:44.537 --> 26:46.604
save that hide,

26:46.639 --> 26:49.306
and get to processing
the meat off this.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.454
You know, every time
I skin a beaver,

27:03.489 --> 27:06.090
I think about one of these
old river guys that, you know,

27:06.125 --> 27:08.025
when I was pretty
green in this country,

27:08.060 --> 27:09.560
and I was real thin,

27:09.595 --> 27:12.796
on my last notch in my
belt and he showed me

27:12.832 --> 27:15.799
right quick how to put
away a beaver for good,

27:15.835 --> 27:17.434
palatable food.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.336
Even though that was
a long, long time ago,

27:19.372 --> 27:20.804
every time I skin a beaver,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.841
I remember
that valuable lesson.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.176
All right, I got the
meat and the liver,

27:26.212 --> 27:28.345
and the hide all separated
from the entrails.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.149
Whoo! Long day.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.885
Now I think it's time to
get a good night's rest.

27:40.526 --> 27:42.059
Brittany: We're not
just going out there and

27:42.094 --> 27:43.994
guaranteed anything.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.296
It is called "hunting".
It's not called "shooting".

27:56.108 --> 27:58.475
Kaleb: I very possibly see
a set of moose antlers.

27:58.511 --> 27:59.476
See the mountain?

27:59.512 --> 28:01.078
Brittany: Uh-huh.
Kaleb: There's that bowl?

28:01.113 --> 28:02.446
I see two white paddles,

28:02.481 --> 28:03.914
they're about the
correct distance apart,

28:03.949 --> 28:05.783
but I gotta get
closer to tell.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.018
It's all the way at the end.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.354
I'm excited to go on
this hike out the ridge.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.289
I'm excited to
see what we see.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.258
I maybe saw
a moose out there,

28:14.293 --> 28:15.359
but I couldn't tell.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.593
So, we're just
gonna get out there.

28:16.629 --> 28:18.028
We're gonna get eyes on it.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.963
Brittany: Ah, how much
farther do we have?

28:19.999 --> 28:22.533
Kaleb: Eh, it's a
little over a mile.
Ups and downs and...

28:23.102 --> 28:24.768
Brittany: Okay.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.870
I'm trying to have a great
attitude 'cause I love the

28:26.906 --> 28:29.239
idea that kaleb and I
are going out on this date

28:29.275 --> 28:31.075
and this adventure.

28:31.110 --> 28:34.078
But I won't lie, it is not easy.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.512
All right, let me just like.

28:35.548 --> 28:36.880
Kaleb: It's just right here.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.849
Brittany: Sounds good.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.655
Kaleb: You're doing great.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.425
Just, just don't
think about the journey,

28:48.461 --> 28:50.661
just one foot in
front of the other.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.201
I think I see the moose.

28:57.236 --> 29:00.270
Brittany: So, why don't
you head over there?

29:03.909 --> 29:06.276
This has definitely
not been an easy trip,

29:06.312 --> 29:07.711
especially for me.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.880
I'm really proud of myself
on everything that I've done

29:09.915 --> 29:12.082
and I know that kaleb
is too and I'm also

29:12.118 --> 29:14.485
very grateful to have
a little rest right now and

29:14.520 --> 29:18.055
really excited to
see what happens next.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.662
Kaleb: Got fooled by a shed.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.132
It made me think that
there was a moose there.

29:28.834 --> 29:33.036
(animal call)

29:45.918 --> 29:47.718
I've sat up here for an hour.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.686
Getting to be
time to head back.

29:49.722 --> 29:52.489
I gotta give brittany
a little more time
to get down the mountain.

29:52.525 --> 29:55.359
So, start heading back.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.662
Not getting a moose on
this hunt is a bummer.

29:58.731 --> 30:00.664
But getting to be out
here with my wife and

30:00.699 --> 30:03.634
enjoy each other's company,
makes it all worthwhile.

30:06.739 --> 30:08.505
Brittany: How's this
for a date night?

30:08.541 --> 30:09.673
Kaleb: It's awesome.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.276
Brittany: Not many people
get to go out and do s'mores

30:12.311 --> 30:14.278
on a camp stove.

30:14.313 --> 30:18.782
Kaleb: Nope, mmm-mmm,
you might have to clean

30:19.385 --> 30:21.518
my beard off.

30:21.754 --> 30:23.153
Brittany: You
ready to go to bed?

30:23.189 --> 30:24.688
Kaleb: Most definitely.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.356
Tomorrow,
I'm gonna break camp,

30:26.392 --> 30:27.758
load up, and head out.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.527
Brittany: Sounds good to me.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.632
Chris: Jessi and I are unique.

30:35.668 --> 30:38.569
We work hard together and we
persevere through everything.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.537
We don't give up.

30:40.773 --> 30:42.773
When the land pushes you,
you just push back.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.476
Chris: These birch
trees are real skinny.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.679
Be able to cut that one
down for us real quick.

30:48.714 --> 30:51.081
Jessi: Okay.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.453
<i> Narrator: In order to</i>
<i> secure clean groundwater,</i>

30:56.488 --> 30:58.355
<i> chris and jessi are</i>
<i> attempting to install a</i>

30:58.390 --> 31:01.458
<i> water pump deep</i>
<i> in the permafrost.</i>

31:01.493 --> 31:03.660
<i> They must use a</i>

31:03.696 --> 31:07.397
<i> in order to create</i>

<i> get to the clean water</i>

31:07.433 --> 31:10.100
<i> deep below the surface.</i>

31:12.071 --> 31:15.439
Jessi: So that orange rope
has to be able to hold

31:15.474 --> 31:16.740
the whole contraption, right?

31:16.775 --> 31:19.476
Chris: Yeah. But it's, um...
Jessi: 550?

31:19.511 --> 31:21.478
Chris: It's 550 cord,
so it's pretty tough.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.746
Jessi: Okay.

31:22.781 --> 31:26.450
Chris: If it breaks, we'll
figure something else out.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.519
Jessi: I'd say chris
is more wild thinking.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.255
He really thinks
out of the box.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.824
But I take my time
and I'm more, like,

31:33.859 --> 31:35.525
of a precise thinker.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.694
Chris is more
experimental and,

31:37.730 --> 31:40.664
"ah, we'll just,
we'll just throw some stuff

31:40.699 --> 31:42.866
together until it works."

31:43.102 --> 31:44.534
chris: That looks pretty good.

31:44.570 --> 31:48.171
Jessi: But this is kind
of a sketchy project.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.274
So, the next part is we
need to find the big weight

31:50.309 --> 31:51.441
to put up there, right?

31:51.477 --> 31:53.677
Chris: Yeah, I'm gonna go
cut one down, cut it up,

31:53.712 --> 31:54.945
drill some holes in it.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.047
We'll hang it and
then we'll pound.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.383
Jessi: Okay.
Chris: Okay.
Jessi: Let's do it.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.053
Chris: We're already
running ragged out here.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.289
I've got this
pulley tied up here,

32:05.324 --> 32:06.490
I feel like it's level.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.759
We can't stop, we have
to keep moving forward.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.827
We have too much to get
done and not enough time.

32:14.934 --> 32:19.036
See, I'm not a professional
knot-tier by any means.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.038
You don't look enthused.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.707
Jessi:
I'm deep in thought, my love.

32:24.576 --> 32:27.277
Things happen and
you get really tired, so,

32:27.313 --> 32:30.480
I'm nervous watching him
because something might happen.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.851
Chris: Let's put the pounder
on and see what we get, huh?

32:36.121 --> 32:37.521
Okay.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.157
I'll lift with the
pulley, you try to guide.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.928
Jessi: Are you going to be able
to lift that all by yourself?

32:44.964 --> 32:46.663
Chris: I'm gonna have to.

32:46.699 --> 32:48.065
Jessi: I'm constantly
worried about him,

32:48.100 --> 32:52.002
but I know I have
incredible faith in him,

32:52.037 --> 32:54.237
but things happen out here.

32:54.807 --> 33:01.144
Chris: Okay.
And a pick, and a knock.
And a pick, and a knock.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.447
Hold that post.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.250
Jessi: Ah, this is some
sketchy bush-crafting.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.088
Okay.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.390
Chris: Okay.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.403
Jessi: Whoa!
Chris: What's going on?

33:26.438 --> 33:28.138
Jessi: You're pulling up
way too high, so like,

33:28.173 --> 33:28.972
I can't even hold it.

33:29.008 --> 33:29.940
Chris: Okay.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.108
I'm, I'm, you just
gotta talk to me.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.376
I thought once we put this up,

33:32.411 --> 33:34.611
we would be pushing
through the permafrost,

33:34.646 --> 33:37.080
but damn, it's hard.

33:37.316 --> 33:42.953
Okay. Got it.
Let's just keep after it.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.457
(thud)

33:48.660 --> 33:49.793
(thud)

33:51.096 --> 33:52.429
(thud)

33:53.432 --> 33:54.531
jessi: Whoa!

34:03.308 --> 34:04.641
A!
Did we just break it?

34:04.676 --> 34:05.776
Chris: Yup.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.444
Jessi: So, the paracord broke?

34:07.479 --> 34:09.913
Chris: Yeah, the
pulley must be sharp.

34:09.948 --> 34:12.816
Jessi: Wow. 550 cord,
and it was double, right?

34:12.851 --> 34:14.317
Chris: Yeah.
I'm surprised it broke.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.620
It all hit,
it broke all at once, too.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.889
Jessi: I'm glad
it went that way.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.090
Chris: Yeah.

34:20.125 --> 34:21.858
I fell backwards pretty fast.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.396
I double tied it with this
550-pound strength cord.

34:26.432 --> 34:28.665
I really thought it was
gonna be good enough.

34:28.700 --> 34:32.035
But we realized how close we
came to hurting ourselves.

34:32.071 --> 34:33.837
The edge of the pulley
is slightly sharp,

34:33.872 --> 34:35.405
it must have cut through.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.574
Okay.

34:37.910 --> 34:39.443
I found this
old wad of rope,

34:39.478 --> 34:41.111
it's gotta
be from the '80s.

34:41.146 --> 34:44.281
It's like what you'd find
at a, a kid's swing set,

34:44.316 --> 34:47.751
but I feel like it's gonna
be tougher than the 550 cord.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.754
This rope doesn't like
to tie knots real well.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.122
Jessi: I don't trust
that yellow rope.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.324
I just don't.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.860
Chris: Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

34:57.296 --> 34:59.463
Well, we'll find out pretty
quick if it's gonna break.

34:59.498 --> 35:02.199
Just make sure to
get out of the way.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.501
Jessi: I think
that it's trash,

35:04.536 --> 35:06.169
but it's chris' treasure,

35:06.205 --> 35:07.871
so I guess we're
just gonna go with it,

35:07.906 --> 35:09.239
and I'm going to really
keep my eyes on it...

35:09.274 --> 35:10.774
Whoa.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.776
Because I don't trust it.

35:12.811 --> 35:13.977
Okay.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.278
Chris: Okay.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.114
Jessi: Come on, water well.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.648
Bring us some water.

35:18.684 --> 35:21.051
It's like a genie.

35:24.823 --> 35:28.692
Chris: That's slamming good.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.829
I can see it going down.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.831
Jessi: We're doing it.

35:35.501 --> 35:38.101
Chris: I mean, it's moving.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.670
Look at that!

35:41.173 --> 35:45.408
We gotta be at least, what,
six feet into permafrost?

35:45.444 --> 35:46.643
Jessi: Yeah.

35:46.678 --> 35:47.811
Chris: We're really moving.

35:47.846 --> 35:51.381
Jessi: Okay.
All my muscles are crying.

35:51.416 --> 35:54.084
I mean, I'm so worn
out from drilling this well

35:54.119 --> 35:56.286
into the ground.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.721
Chris: I'm feeling like
we're almost there.

35:57.756 --> 36:00.624
What do you say, like, a
couple more inches and I think

36:00.659 --> 36:03.093
we're going to be good?

36:03.328 --> 36:04.694
Let's knock this out.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.096
We're coming into
home stretch.

36:06.131 --> 36:07.497
Jessi: Five!

36:07.533 --> 36:08.865
Chris: I don't have
much left to give.

36:08.901 --> 36:10.133
Jessi: Four!

36:10.169 --> 36:12.035
Chris: My arms are burning,
my core is burning.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.570
Jessi: Three!

36:13.605 --> 36:16.039
Chris: I'm hitting it
with everything I have.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.140
Jessi: Two!

36:17.176 --> 36:18.275
One more.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.944
Chris: This is it.
I'm getting water.

36:23.549 --> 36:24.681
Jessi: Okay!

36:24.716 --> 36:26.283
Chris: Down to the ground.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.385
Oh.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.720
Jessi: Oh, god.
Chris: Oh. Wow.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.190
I feel like we did it, man.

36:33.225 --> 36:34.558
We're starting to move.

36:34.593 --> 36:37.160
We gotta be through
that permafrost.

36:37.196 --> 36:38.595
And the only thing left
to do is to try to put

36:38.630 --> 36:41.531
that well head
on and see if we can get
some water to come up.

36:41.567 --> 36:42.566
Can try it.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.000
Jessi: That's the
only way to test it,

36:44.036 --> 36:45.202
is to test it, right?

36:45.237 --> 36:46.770
Chris: Yeah.
And if we don't get water.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.806
Jessi: Keep drilling.
Chris: Keep drilling.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.679
Kaleb: I'm not one to
take failure laying down,

36:55.714 --> 36:57.347
as it were.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.616
That's how I grew up,
that's how I am as an adult.

37:00.052 --> 37:02.152
I strive for success.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.065
I just spotted a
moose down there.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.434
He's about a half a mile away.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.603
This one
is for real a moose,
because it's moving.

37:20.205 --> 37:23.039
Even though we
made a valiant effort
on the moose hunt,

37:23.075 --> 37:25.575
it's important to me
to just keep trying.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.778
Brittany is watching the
kids and I'm gonna continue on

37:28.814 --> 37:29.946
up the mountain.

37:29.982 --> 37:32.082
I know there's bears,
there's moose.

37:32.117 --> 37:33.750
There's all sorts
of game up there.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.486
I'm not gonna stop
until I succeed.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.490
Boy, he is in the most
impossible brush right now.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.893
Problem is I can't get
down there to pull him out.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.197
It's not ethical, it's not
morally right to just shoot

37:47.232 --> 37:49.299
something and leave
it in the field, so,

37:49.334 --> 37:52.302
knowing that I can get it out
before I pull the trigger is

37:52.337 --> 37:53.803
vitally important.

37:53.839 --> 37:56.473
I think he bedded down,
the little stinker.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.575
Ah!

37:58.610 --> 38:00.644
Well, this is hunting.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.613
I'm not always guaranteed
a successful outcome.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.986
Oh, wow.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.521
There's a bear out there,

38:11.556 --> 38:13.657
he's about 300
yards away right now,

38:13.692 --> 38:16.426
which is too
far for me to shoot.

38:17.195 --> 38:18.728
I think I'm gonna
go after him.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.998
I gotta go way up
and around, though.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.000
The wind predominantly
is going up the valley,

38:24.036 --> 38:26.670
so I should be able
to effectively sneak up

38:26.705 --> 38:29.306
on him that way.

38:35.180 --> 38:36.913
Moose was the
target on this hunt,

38:36.948 --> 38:38.648
but it's fall time,

38:38.683 --> 38:41.184
and its black bear
hunting season.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.620
Targets of opportunity
is the name of the game

38:43.655 --> 38:47.057
when you're harvesting
meat for the freezer.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.294
He keeps getting closer.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.238

39:20.192 --> 39:21.624
All right.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.626
I got him.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.496
He is done.

39:27.099 --> 39:29.833
This black bear is
probably the biggest bear

39:29.868 --> 39:31.101
I've ever harvested.

39:31.136 --> 39:35.238
Up in the high country,
man, those bears are fat.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.775
They've been packing on
the pounds for months now,

39:38.810 --> 39:40.210
and as long as they're
awake, they eat.

39:40.245 --> 39:42.011
Dirt, twigs, berries,

39:42.047 --> 39:44.581
they somehow
turn that into fat.

39:44.616 --> 39:45.715
Blows me away.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.951
If I ate the way they did,
I'd have a stomachache.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.619
This is where he rolled.

39:49.654 --> 39:51.421
I can see blood.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.823
Little bits and pieces
of blood in the brush.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.060
So, I just gotta follow
his trajectory down into

39:57.095 --> 39:59.929
the creek bottom and
I'll be able to find him.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.273
I see the bear down there,
so I'm gonna move in on him

40:10.308 --> 40:12.509
really carefully.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.717
He is certified dead.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.394
Brittany: Kids! It's daddy!

40:32.998 --> 40:35.031
Whoa.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.766
What did daddy get?

40:36.802 --> 40:38.101
Well, that was successful.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.637
Kaleb: Yeah. Finally.

40:41.773 --> 40:42.972
Brittany: Yay!

40:43.008 --> 40:44.908
Even if it's not a moose,
but I think that this will do

40:44.943 --> 40:46.309
nicely in our freezer.

40:46.344 --> 40:47.343
Kaleb: Yeah.

40:47.379 --> 40:48.978
It'll ought to fill
it up real nice.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.246
This is a big bear, too.

40:50.282 --> 40:51.414
There's a lot of meat on him.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.916
Brittany: Yeah, how
much meat do you think?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.017
Gilbert: 14 pounds.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.285
Kaleb: 60 pounds, probably.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.586
Brittany: 60 pounds?
That'll be good.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.087
Gilbert: 14.
Brittany: 14?

40:58.123 --> 40:59.622
Gilbert: No, 45.
Brittany: 45?

40:59.658 --> 41:01.324
So, gilbert's guess is 45.

41:01.359 --> 41:03.226
Elovie: My guess is a 1,012.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.327
Brittany: Kaleb's is 60.

41:04.362 --> 41:05.462
How many?

41:05.497 --> 41:07.230
Elovie: My guess is 1,012.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.998
Brittany: 1,012?
Okay, and I think.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.300
Kaleb: Wow! That's ambitious.

41:10.335 --> 41:12.469
Shall I go to the
shop and skin him out?

41:12.504 --> 41:13.903
Brittany: I think
that sounds great.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.338
Ellie wants to go.
Go hop on the four-wheeler.

41:15.373 --> 41:16.739
Kaleb: Go clean
my four-wheeler off?

41:16.775 --> 41:18.741
Brittany: I'll take your bike.

41:23.949 --> 41:26.216
Kaleb: Now the work begins.

41:26.451 --> 41:29.285
Even though my goal in
going out on this hunt was to

41:29.321 --> 41:31.955
get a moose, I really just
needed to get some meat for

41:31.990 --> 41:33.456
our family to eat.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.758
Not very many people
have the opportunity to just

41:35.794 --> 41:37.827
walk out their
door and go hunting.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.330
To harvest a black bear to
put away meat for the winter,

41:41.199 --> 41:43.800
I'm eternally grateful for it.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.369
This was a great
weekend with my wife.

41:46.404 --> 41:49.906
We got to connect and struggle

just enjoy each other.
