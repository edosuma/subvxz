00:20.043 --> 00:25.007
I know.
Let's play Who Blinks First.

00:25.615 --> 00:29.244
Loser has to do you-know-what.

00:29.419 --> 00:32.650
Ready, set, go.

00:45.635 --> 00:49.366
There are six steps.
First we state the question.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.382
What's the matter
with you two? Clean up this mess.

01:42.258 --> 01:43.987
Who won?

01:45.795 --> 01:47.729
Oh, man.

02:42.919 --> 02:44.910
<i>This is my neighborhood.</i>

02:53.830 --> 02:56.765
<i>And these are some of my neighbors.</i>

02:56.933 --> 02:59.197
Go 10 paces west.

02:59.368 --> 03:02.769
- One, two...
- That's east, you lunkhead.

03:02.939 --> 03:04.634
Oh, okay.

03:06.175 --> 03:07.301
- One...
- South.

03:07.477 --> 03:12.005
Boys? Come look after your sister.

03:12.882 --> 03:14.509
So much for our treasure hunt.

03:14.684 --> 03:17.915
That baby is always ruining our adventures.

03:19.822 --> 03:21.847
<i>Some of my neighbors are weird.</i>

03:25.328 --> 03:28.263
Okay, that'll do it. Give me your foot.

03:28.431 --> 03:30.331
Other foot.

03:33.770 --> 03:36.967
Okay, inside. The germs are coming.

03:39.609 --> 03:43.943
<i>In fact, some of them</i>
<i>are not very neighborly at all.</i>

03:49.118 --> 03:50.881
<i>And then there's my house...</i>

03:51.254 --> 03:56.692
<i>... with its quaint, adorable, everyday,</i>
<i>supportive and connected family.</i>

03:56.859 --> 04:00.090
Mega power point damage.
Super effective.

04:00.263 --> 04:04.222
Nano-blast. Major confusion.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.766
Still playing with your imaginary friends?

04:06.936 --> 04:08.164
No.

04:08.337 --> 04:09.895
Freak.

04:10.473 --> 04:11.997
I don't think I'm a freak.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.767
Do you think I'm a freak?

04:14.944 --> 04:16.411
Shut up. Who asked you?

04:17.146 --> 04:18.408
<i>And we should be connected.</i>

04:18.581 --> 04:23.280
<i>After all, this is Black Box Unlimited</i>
<i>Worldwide Industries Incorporated...</i>

04:23.452 --> 04:25.147
<i>... or Black, Inc. for short.</i>

04:25.321 --> 04:28.552
<i>You know them as the guys that make</i>
<i>the Black Box all-in-one gadget...</i>

04:28.724 --> 04:30.817
<i>... that's sweeping the nation.</i>

04:31.494 --> 04:35.658
<i>The whole operation is smack-dab in</i>
<i>the middle of the Black Falls Community.</i>

04:36.833 --> 04:39.427
<i>Development to manufacturing</i>
<i>to shipping...</i>

04:39.602 --> 04:41.536
<i>... all in one centralized location.</i>

04:42.171 --> 04:46.938
<i>Hundreds and hundreds of employees</i>
<i>both live and work here...</i>

04:47.109 --> 04:49.100
<i>... including my parents.</i>

04:49.378 --> 04:51.676
<i>I've got a garage full of gadgets.</i>

04:51.848 --> 04:54.112
<i>Why do I need this one, Mr. Black?</i>

04:54.283 --> 04:56.308
<i>What does the Black Box do?</i>

04:56.485 --> 04:58.817
<i>Mike, the question is,</i>
<i>what doesn't it do?</i>

04:58.988 --> 05:01.752
<i>It's not only the ultimate</i>
<i>communication device...</i>

05:01.924 --> 05:04.620
<i>... keeping us connected</i>
<i>to each other and the world.</i>

05:04.794 --> 05:08.628
<i>That's not all. It's also</i>
<i>a multimedia player, a can opener...</i>

05:08.798 --> 05:10.561
<i>... a dog groomer...</i>

05:10.733 --> 05:11.995
<i>... a vacuum cleaner...</i>

05:12.168 --> 05:13.692
<i>... a baby monitor.</i>

05:13.870 --> 05:15.201
<i>It's a shredder.</i>

05:15.371 --> 05:19.034
<i>It calls the ambulance if you fall down</i>
<i>in your bathroom and can't get up.</i>

05:19.208 --> 05:23.542
<i>It removes rust, paint, pet odors.</i>
<i>Thousands of uses.</i>

05:23.713 --> 05:29.549
<i>It's just about everything</i>
<i>you could ever possibly wish for.</i>

05:29.719 --> 05:35.715
<i>In</i> super grande, grande y el niÃ±o.

05:38.227 --> 05:42.664
<i>And this is the man</i>
<i>who owns it all, Mr. Black.</i>

05:42.832 --> 05:45.027
<i>Mr. Carbon Black.</i>

05:45.201 --> 05:49.535
I hope that applause was meant
for you, my trusted partners...

05:49.705 --> 05:51.900
...in our quest to put the Black Box...

05:52.074 --> 05:56.841
...in every hand and home
in the civilized world.

05:57.013 --> 05:59.504
That is our goal.

05:59.682 --> 06:02.412
Who can tell us how close
we are to achieving it?

06:04.620 --> 06:05.848
That's right.

06:06.022 --> 06:08.991
Not even close.

06:09.158 --> 06:10.921
And why is that?

06:11.093 --> 06:14.654
Because the Black Box
is facing fierce competition...

06:14.830 --> 06:19.096
...from the Purple Pyramid,
the Silver Cylinder and other such rip-offs.

06:19.268 --> 06:21.668
- They're nowhere near as good.
- They're catching up.

06:21.837 --> 06:23.964
And I can't have them eating
into our profits.

06:28.577 --> 06:30.670
We need to leave them all...

06:31.547 --> 06:32.571
...in the dust!

06:34.183 --> 06:35.650
Let them eat soot.

06:36.519 --> 06:37.816
Sir?

06:38.321 --> 06:42.519
Focus groups have identified our multiple
uses as a drawback instead of a positive.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.426
We're offering a toaster option.

06:44.593 --> 06:46.857
Nowadays, most people
don't even eat bread.

06:47.029 --> 06:48.997
- She's right.
- You're fired.

06:49.899 --> 06:51.696
- So are you.
- But...

06:51.867 --> 06:53.892
Do your spouses also work
for this company?

06:54.070 --> 06:55.094
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:55.271 --> 06:58.468
They're fired as well. Move out
of your homes, effective immediately.

06:58.641 --> 07:01.872
You think fear tactics and cutthroat
competition yield better results?

07:02.044 --> 07:03.568
Well, it won't!

07:06.749 --> 07:09.309
The new Version X upgrade...

07:09.485 --> 07:13.285
...has to shut down the competition
once and for all.

07:13.456 --> 07:16.789
Have them playing catch-up
for the next 10 years.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.290
- Team A leader?
- Yes, sir?

07:18.461 --> 07:20.088
- Team B leader?
- Right here.

07:20.262 --> 07:23.322
I expect results soon. Live up
to this challenge, you make partner.

07:23.499 --> 07:25.831
Don't and you
and your families are out.

07:26.535 --> 07:28.162
But we're married.

07:28.337 --> 07:30.601
I don't see how your social life
is my concern.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.741
So if he loses,
then I get fired even if I win?

07:34.910 --> 07:36.810
Well, no, that's preposterous. Heh, heh.

07:36.979 --> 07:39.174
But you just said
if she doesn't make partner...

07:39.348 --> 07:42.340
...then she and her family are out,
and I'm her family.

07:42.518 --> 07:43.917
Then you better not lose.

07:45.421 --> 07:49.448
Clearly you two haven't figured out that
delightful little paradox called marriage.

07:49.625 --> 07:52.458
Just get it done, whatever it takes.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.693
<i>And the answer to Black's problem...</i>

07:59.869 --> 08:00.893
Whatever it takes.

08:01.070 --> 08:04.528
- <i>it literally fell from the sky.</i>

08:07.710 --> 08:09.905
<i>No, no, no. Wait.</i>

08:10.079 --> 08:11.808
<i>Is that what happened next?</i>

08:11.981 --> 08:14.779
<i>See that wishing rock I'm holding?</i>

08:14.950 --> 08:19.819
<i>It made things so confusing,</i>
<i>I can hardly remember the order of events.</i>

08:19.989 --> 08:21.479
<i>Go forward a bit.</i>

08:27.463 --> 08:29.727
<i>Yeah, that wasn't it either.</i>

08:29.899 --> 08:34.232
<i>I'm probably going to have to tell you</i>
<i>the story completely out of order...</i>

08:34.403 --> 08:36.928
<i>... in a series of shorts.</i>

08:49.051 --> 08:51.281
<i>Let's start here.</i>

08:51.454 --> 08:54.355
<i>Maybe we should go back to when</i>
<i>I first came into possession...</i>

08:54.523 --> 08:57.287
<i>... of the rainbow-colored rock.</i>

09:05.801 --> 09:07.735
<i>Oh, by the way...</i>

09:07.903 --> 09:10.337
<i>... my name is Toby, Toby Thompson.</i>

09:11.807 --> 09:15.174
<i>I wanna give you an idea</i>
<i>of how I start every morning.</i>

09:15.344 --> 09:18.108
<i>Maintaining a mouth like this</i>
<i>is no small task.</i>

09:18.714 --> 09:22.650
<i>First I use a special toothbrush</i>
<i>between the wires and my gums...</i>

09:22.852 --> 09:27.016
<i>... to loosen any food particles</i>
<i>that may have lodged in my braces.</i>

09:27.189 --> 09:30.454
<i>Upper teeth: positioning the bristles</i>
<i>at a 45-degree angle...</i>

09:30.626 --> 09:33.151
<i>... brushing towards the gum</i>
<i>in a circular motion.</i>

09:33.329 --> 09:35.957
<i>Inside, tops,</i>
<i>then repeat for the lower set.</i>

09:36.132 --> 09:38.862
<i>Rinse, spit, mirror check.</i>

09:39.034 --> 09:41.195
<i>Is this the reason people think</i>
<i>I'm a dork?</i>

09:41.370 --> 09:42.564
<i>Of course not.</i>

09:42.738 --> 09:46.572
<i>Braces are necessary</i>
<i>when you have hillbilly teeth like mine.</i>

09:46.742 --> 09:48.539
<i>No, no. Not done yet.</i>

09:49.145 --> 09:50.578
<i>Now I floss...</i>

09:52.414 --> 09:55.212
<i>... and use a special pick</i>
<i>to get under the brackets.</i>

09:55.384 --> 09:58.319
<i>Rinse, spit, mirror check.</i>

09:58.487 --> 10:01.081
<i>That's it. Time to eat breakfast.</i>

10:05.594 --> 10:08.392
Guess what. Toby's playing
with his imaginary friends again.

10:08.564 --> 10:09.929
Am not.

10:10.099 --> 10:11.999
Shouldn't you be already
moved out by now?

10:12.168 --> 10:14.568
I mean, you are, like, 19 or 20.

10:15.104 --> 10:17.072
Keep it down. I can't hear myself type.

10:17.239 --> 10:20.106
What about your friend Nose?
Don't you play with him anymore?

10:20.276 --> 10:21.709
Toby, you need friends.

10:21.877 --> 10:23.504
Friends are very important.

10:23.679 --> 10:26.773
Look at your dad and I.
We're the best of friends.

10:28.150 --> 10:31.449
Oh, he has plenty of friends at school,
Mom. They can't wait to see him.

10:31.620 --> 10:35.386
In fact, I hear he has
his own welcoming committee.

10:36.559 --> 10:40.256
<i>That's just a nice way</i>
<i>of saying "bullies at school."</i>

10:40.429 --> 10:43.193
<i>I know I'm not the only kid</i>
<i>in the world to get picked on...</i>

10:43.365 --> 10:47.096
<i>... but my situation is unique</i>
<i>in a few ways.</i>

10:47.570 --> 10:51.028
Hey, metal mouth.
Got another date with the trash can.

10:51.207 --> 10:52.731
<i>Hold on.</i>

10:53.008 --> 10:57.035
<i>This is Cole Black, son of Mr. Black.</i>

10:57.213 --> 11:01.343
<i>If you're thinking this is the worst kid</i>
<i>in the whole school, wait.</i>

11:02.251 --> 11:04.947
<i>He's got a sister.</i>

11:05.120 --> 11:09.819
<i>Helvetica Black, the leader of the pack.</i>

11:14.363 --> 11:16.888
Heh, heh. Wimp.

11:19.001 --> 11:20.662
Shall we do this?

11:24.106 --> 11:26.199
I just realized something.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.639
I know why you have them
beat up on me every day.

11:28.811 --> 11:29.835
Because I hate you?

11:30.946 --> 11:32.072
Because you love me.

11:32.248 --> 11:34.580
Ooh...

11:36.318 --> 11:38.286
That's right, isn't it?

11:39.221 --> 11:40.984
We're both outsiders.

11:41.156 --> 11:42.748
- We're both ignored.
- <i>No.</i>

11:42.925 --> 11:45.985
We both have railroad tracks
for braces.

11:48.797 --> 11:51.595
We're lonely and boring
and always getting in trouble...

11:51.767 --> 11:53.894
...because we have nothing else
better to do.

11:54.069 --> 11:58.870
So you're head over heels in love with me
and that makes you...

11:59.041 --> 12:01.100
...furious.

12:03.545 --> 12:05.479
Am I right?

12:06.515 --> 12:08.005
How about...

12:10.653 --> 12:12.018
...no?

12:16.925 --> 12:19.519
<i>So I'm not a psychologist.</i>

12:19.995 --> 12:21.963
My science report today is about...

12:22.564 --> 12:24.429
...science.

12:25.334 --> 12:26.631
Oh, man, I just forgot it.

12:26.802 --> 12:28.030
Um...

12:28.404 --> 12:31.635
The scientific part of it,
which would be, um...

12:31.807 --> 12:32.865
...science.

12:33.809 --> 12:36.573
<i>This fish is the only friend</i>
<i>I have in this dump.</i>

12:36.745 --> 12:37.769
How you doing?

12:37.946 --> 12:40.414
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>it's a really good school.</i>

12:40.582 --> 12:43.050
<i>It's just the people in it that suck.</i>

12:43.218 --> 12:46.483
In olden times, they burned
scientists and they called them witches...

12:46.655 --> 12:49.180
...because the townspeople
didn't understand science...

12:49.358 --> 12:51.383
...and they thought it was magic.

12:52.194 --> 12:55.721
Like using a magic rock
to make wishes come true.

12:56.532 --> 12:59.126
- But I have a hypenothesis.
- Hypothesis.

12:59.301 --> 13:01.667
Loogie, you didn't do your homework,
did you?

13:01.837 --> 13:04.829
Yeah, I did, but a crocodile ate it.

13:05.541 --> 13:07.702
Really, I'm serious.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.006
Next presenter.

13:10.846 --> 13:13.212
Scientists who study wasps...

13:13.382 --> 13:17.648
...have long observed aggressive behavior
in stronger females...

13:17.820 --> 13:21.017
...towards the weaker males
of the colony...

13:21.190 --> 13:24.785
...including threats of stinging
and mauling.

13:26.028 --> 13:29.589
But recently, they have discovered
that some females...

13:29.765 --> 13:35.260
...will force the male headfirst
into an empty cell in the nest.

13:35.437 --> 13:38.429
Behavior known as "male stuffing."

13:40.109 --> 13:45.877
I'd like to demonstrate this phenomenon
using a trash can and a volunteer.

13:48.784 --> 13:49.876
Toe Thompson?

14:01.029 --> 14:02.826
- Hey, my name is Toby...
- Shh.

14:02.998 --> 14:05.023
The Blinkers are going for the record.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.896
They've been in a stare-off
since second period.

14:08.070 --> 14:09.662
What's the record?

14:09.838 --> 14:12.136
Longer than you have to live.

14:12.741 --> 14:13.935
Candy bars?

14:16.645 --> 14:19.637
Why do you let yourself
get bullied like that?

14:20.382 --> 14:22.350
I don't really think I have a choice.

14:22.751 --> 14:25.345
Sure you do.
Doesn't matter who their dad is.

14:25.521 --> 14:28.513
What matters is who you are,
who you wanna be.

14:29.224 --> 14:31.124
And you live your life like that?

14:31.293 --> 14:32.692
Of course. Ow.

14:32.861 --> 14:34.954
Come on, Loogie, you dork.
We gotta get home.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.655
We're gonna try to get the baby
to give us lottery numbers.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.393
Good luck with
the whole two-minutes-to-live thing.

14:44.139 --> 14:46.767
<i>It shouldn't be this hard to make friends.</i>

14:46.942 --> 14:49.206
<i>I'm smart. I'm funny.</i>

14:49.378 --> 14:52.905
<i>Like funny, ha-ha. Not funny weird.</i>

14:53.081 --> 14:57.017
<i>So, what's wrong with me?</i>

14:57.286 --> 14:59.311
What's wrong with you?

14:59.488 --> 15:03.049
Oh, buddy, where do I begin?

15:09.298 --> 15:12.165
<i>Run, run, run. Chase, chase, chase.</i>

15:52.875 --> 15:54.137
Ah.

15:55.744 --> 15:57.268
Get me a rock!

15:57.446 --> 15:58.936
Get me a rock!

15:59.114 --> 16:00.877
Where's my rock?

16:06.955 --> 16:08.115
Run!

16:08.290 --> 16:10.087
It's gonna be worse for you
tomorrow, freak.

16:10.259 --> 16:11.521
Let's go!

16:12.160 --> 16:13.388
Huh?

16:23.572 --> 16:26.564
<i>Make a wish.</i>

16:29.177 --> 16:30.769
Who said that?

16:32.781 --> 16:35.807
<i>Make a wish.</i>

16:38.587 --> 16:41.021
Must be hearing things.

16:42.691 --> 16:46.525
<i>Make a wish.</i>

16:50.365 --> 16:51.662
<i>Make a wish.</i>

16:51.833 --> 16:53.733
Okay, okay.

16:54.770 --> 16:57.466
I wish I had friends...

16:58.407 --> 17:01.069
...as interesting and as unique as I am.

17:25.534 --> 17:27.058
Friends.

17:38.113 --> 17:40.638
Come on, guys. Get in there.

17:56.798 --> 17:57.958
<i>We sifted some flour.</i>

17:58.133 --> 18:01.591
<i>We talk about clarified butter, because</i>
<i>people get concerned about butter.</i>

18:01.770 --> 18:03.533
<i>You can make clarified butter at home.</i>

18:05.407 --> 18:06.704
Hi.

18:07.643 --> 18:10.578
Why didn't you take the bus?
That's always our backup plan.

18:11.013 --> 18:13.004
It's okay. I just felt like walking.

18:26.628 --> 18:30.223
Sorry, son. I, uh, texted your mom to
pick you up, because my meeting ran late.

18:30.399 --> 18:34.529
I texted your dad saying that I couldn't go,
so he should leave early and pick you up.

18:34.703 --> 18:37.672
Your text messages must've gotten lost
in a sea of my text messages.

18:37.839 --> 18:40.740
Same with yours. Mine. Whatever.

18:41.243 --> 18:42.267
Noodles?

18:42.444 --> 18:44.742
It's okay, I'll serve myself.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.049
Oh. You having problems
with your Black Box too?

18:48.216 --> 18:49.581
Yeah.

18:50.152 --> 18:51.414
No.

18:51.753 --> 18:55.120
Ugh! I just broke up with my boyfriend.
He thinks he's so mature, you know?

18:55.290 --> 18:58.259
He's not. He's a child.

18:58.427 --> 19:02.955
He is living with his parents
and isn't he, like, 23?

19:04.132 --> 19:05.531
No.

19:08.403 --> 19:09.995
What was that?

19:15.143 --> 19:17.304
It's probably the ice maker...

19:17.879 --> 19:19.779
...making ice?

19:22.117 --> 19:23.607
I'll go check on it.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.146
Humph.

19:33.695 --> 19:35.287
Whoa.

19:35.464 --> 19:38.524
Did you guys come
from a gourmet planet?

19:58.353 --> 20:00.116
Thanks, guys.

20:01.890 --> 20:03.323
<i>Team leaders!</i>

20:03.492 --> 20:04.516
<i>Progress report.</i>

20:04.693 --> 20:09.687
Uh, I've implemented some new procedurals
that should maximize our value potential.

20:09.865 --> 20:14.598
Well, I have highlighted our asset
management and jump-started...

20:15.604 --> 20:17.629
<i>... our business paradigm.</i>

20:17.806 --> 20:19.137
One moment, please.

20:22.544 --> 20:24.512
Sounds like a load to me.

20:24.679 --> 20:26.476
Initiate termination procedure?

20:26.648 --> 20:27.672
Mm.

20:28.450 --> 20:29.508
Not yet.

20:29.684 --> 20:33.017
I'll fire one of them
at the company costume ball.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.179
That should be good
for company morale.

20:35.724 --> 20:38.557
<i>Very well, then.</i>
<i>Keep up the good work, you two.</i>

20:40.428 --> 20:42.191
We are gonna get fired.

21:10.492 --> 21:11.516
Nice.

21:13.662 --> 21:15.323
Very nice.

21:15.630 --> 21:17.689
Time to clean your room, sport.

21:19.301 --> 21:20.768
Well...

21:21.169 --> 21:24.070
...someone's looking
for a raise in their allowance.

21:28.643 --> 21:31.009
Do you guys also clean...

21:31.513 --> 21:32.537
...teeth?

21:38.587 --> 21:41.750
Toby. Where are my keys?

21:41.923 --> 21:43.857
I know you're hiding them,
you little alien.

21:44.025 --> 21:45.925
JOHN
<i>Maybe I do keep messing up...</i>

21:46.094 --> 21:47.584
<i>... and maybe it is all my fault, but...</i>

21:47.762 --> 21:48.956
No, no. I broke up with you...

21:49.130 --> 21:53.066
...so why are you calling me,
Mr. I'm-23-And-I-Still-Live-With-My-Mom?

21:53.235 --> 21:56.398
<i>Hey, I wish you would</i>
<i>just stop talking about my mom...</i>

21:56.571 --> 21:57.595
Pretty.

21:57.772 --> 21:59.501
<i>... and just go out with me again, God.</i>

21:59.674 --> 22:03.735
Oh. Okay, well, I wish you'd grow up.
How about...?

22:04.045 --> 22:05.342
<i>Whoa, that's huge!</i>

22:05.513 --> 22:08.243
<i>My hand's huge!</i>
<i>My hand's huger than my foot!</i>

22:08.416 --> 22:11.010
<i>I'm growing, I'm growing!</i>

22:11.186 --> 22:13.916
- Relax. Jeez.
- <i>I'm getting so big that...</i>

22:28.503 --> 22:30.596
You fixed all my teeth.

22:33.708 --> 22:35.869
How strong are you guys?

22:36.044 --> 22:38.945
I mean, if you really had to be tough
against a bully.

22:39.114 --> 22:42.311
Because I might have a job for you
tomorrow at school.

22:55.931 --> 22:58.456
I was hoping for something
a little more menacing.

22:58.633 --> 23:00.498
I will show no mercy.

23:04.139 --> 23:06.107
You're hired.

23:25.727 --> 23:28.594
I have no time for you,
but now I'm having to chase you down?

23:28.763 --> 23:31.163
JOHN
<i>I don't feel so good. I'm in the hospital.</i>

23:31.333 --> 23:33.494
- In the hospital?
- <i>And it's all your fault.</i>

23:33.668 --> 23:35.192
Oh, my fault? How is it my fault?

23:35.370 --> 23:37.463
<i>They're building me</i>
<i>a bigger room as we speak.</i>

23:37.639 --> 23:39.903
They're making a bigger room for you?
What are...?

23:40.075 --> 23:41.406
- <i>You see what happens?</i>
- Hello?

23:41.576 --> 23:43.168
<i>Oh, no! It's happening again!</i>

23:43.345 --> 23:44.471
Hello?

23:48.149 --> 23:49.912
Dad says I have to give you a ride.

23:50.085 --> 23:52.019
It's okay. I just feel like walking.

23:52.420 --> 23:54.547
You look different.
Did you bathe or something?

23:55.023 --> 23:56.217
No.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.824
Weirdo.

24:19.948 --> 24:21.939
I'll take it from here, guys.

24:23.451 --> 24:25.851
Can't have anybody seeing you...

24:26.321 --> 24:27.345
...yet.

24:28.523 --> 24:29.547
There he is!

24:30.458 --> 24:31.720
Grab him!

24:39.134 --> 24:42.069
How would you like your braces
up your nose?

24:44.939 --> 24:46.099
Your braces.

24:47.942 --> 24:50.274
Where are they?

24:51.079 --> 24:52.307
Up my nose.

24:57.819 --> 25:00.788
I put a few candy bars in the front pocket.

25:00.955 --> 25:05.221
My Black Box is set to music mode
in case you get hungry or bored.

25:06.194 --> 25:08.025
Who are you talking to?

25:08.196 --> 25:10.061
Imaginary friends?

25:12.400 --> 25:14.368
Rock 'n' roll.

25:14.536 --> 25:16.800
Heavy metal.

25:18.540 --> 25:20.235
Not today.

25:20.408 --> 25:24.344
Now, class, we continue our experiments
with combustible liquids...

25:24.512 --> 25:29.745
...so everyone please take your seats
and make sure to wear eye protection.

25:29.918 --> 25:31.886
Now that we've isolated our agents...

25:32.053 --> 25:35.318
...we can make a hypothesis
as to the outcome.

25:45.867 --> 25:48.802
Toby, can we stifle our inner
<i>High School Musical</i> long enough...

25:48.970 --> 25:50.699
...to observe this chemical reaction?

25:50.872 --> 25:53.636
I have to get it exactly right.

25:54.342 --> 25:57.971
Once we introduce the catalyst...

25:59.481 --> 26:01.608
- Give it back.
- Mine, mine, mine.

26:01.783 --> 26:02.875
Mine, mine, mine.

26:05.253 --> 26:06.515
Mine.

26:06.688 --> 26:07.985
Ow!

26:08.156 --> 26:11.319
- Sorry.
- You will be.

26:47.862 --> 26:48.886
Drop it!

26:50.732 --> 26:52.529
Very perceptive, Toby.

26:52.700 --> 26:56.693
We must be certain
to use the proper amount of catalyst.

26:56.871 --> 26:59.066
In this case...

26:59.240 --> 27:02.368
...one drop.

27:04.612 --> 27:06.011
- That's it.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

27:06.881 --> 27:07.973
You asked for it.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.949
Say hello to my little friends.

27:11.119 --> 27:14.350
Mr. Thompson, perhaps a visit
to the principal's office is in order...

27:14.522 --> 27:17.047
...possibly followed by one
to the school psychologist!

27:52.527 --> 27:54.017
Break!

28:11.613 --> 28:14.980
I think I broke...

28:15.149 --> 28:17.617
...a nail.

28:18.653 --> 28:21.053
Me too.

28:31.766 --> 28:35.224
I'm gonna squash you for this.

28:36.070 --> 28:37.697
I know.

28:37.872 --> 28:40.636
So you don't know
who those little dudes were?

28:41.409 --> 28:43.934
I thought they were my friends.

28:48.650 --> 28:52.484
He wished for friends.
We should abduct him.

28:52.654 --> 28:55.646
He is not evolved enough
for an autopsy.

28:55.823 --> 28:59.884
He has friends all around.
He just doesn't know it yet.

29:01.396 --> 29:04.763
<i>Well, my alien buddies didn't stick around.</i>

29:06.968 --> 29:10.404
<i>I guess friends can't be wished</i>
<i>into existence.</i>

29:12.407 --> 29:13.965
<i>You gotta work for them.</i>

29:25.553 --> 29:27.316
Ha. Ha.

29:27.488 --> 29:29.479
Let's see you try it.

30:06.994 --> 30:08.928
I was right.

30:09.731 --> 30:11.221
You do like me.

30:14.902 --> 30:16.392
<i>You gotta have enemies...</i>

30:16.838 --> 30:18.100
<i>... to know who your friends are.</i>

30:18.272 --> 30:20.570
Mm, toe jam.

30:20.742 --> 30:23.609
<i>And now that my space aliens</i>
<i>have disappeared...</i>

30:23.778 --> 30:26.338
<i>... I have at least one new friend:</i>

30:26.514 --> 30:27.538
<i>Loogie.</i>

30:27.715 --> 30:30.479
<i>In fact, he's really the one</i>
<i>to blame for all this.</i>

30:30.651 --> 30:34.553
<i>So let's go all the way back</i>
<i>to the real beginning...</i>

30:34.722 --> 30:38.123
<i>... with Loogie, his brothers...</i>

30:38.292 --> 30:40.692
<i>... and the storm that started it all.</i>

31:05.219 --> 31:08.154
I'm tired of video games
and I'm bored with TV.

31:08.322 --> 31:09.789
Let's do something.

31:09.957 --> 31:14.189
We've been through this before.
There's nothing else to do.

31:14.362 --> 31:17.024
Come play video games with us.
We need a third person.

31:18.866 --> 31:20.629
Let's go on an outdoor adventure.

31:20.802 --> 31:23.202
There's a huge thunderstorm. Look.

31:23.971 --> 31:27.031
REPORTER
<i>The biggest rainstorm in Texas history.</i>

31:27.208 --> 31:28.641
<i>Well, folks, it looks like we're...</i>

31:40.588 --> 31:44.251
That's strange.
It's raining everywhere else.

31:44.425 --> 31:45.949
What the?

31:46.127 --> 31:47.890
Outside! Bring the treasure map!

31:48.062 --> 31:49.393
Wait a minute, guys.

31:49.564 --> 31:52.328
What are we gonna do about Baby?

31:55.002 --> 31:57.402
It's in baby monitor mode.

31:57.572 --> 32:01.008
If she wakes up,
I'll hear it on my Black Box...

32:01.175 --> 32:04.303
...and we'll come back
and give her a bottle.

32:04.479 --> 32:05.571
Huh.

32:05.980 --> 32:10.440
I don't get it.
What happened to the storm?

32:10.718 --> 32:12.879
Maybe it's global warming.

32:13.554 --> 32:14.714
This sucks.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.221
Even my brain feels hot.

32:17.391 --> 32:19.359
I read once
that yawning cools the brain.

32:19.527 --> 32:23.691
Well, just keep talking
and I'll start yawning for sure.

32:24.499 --> 32:26.467
Look at that!

32:26.634 --> 32:29.102
You know what's at the end
of a rainbow, don't you?

32:29.270 --> 32:31.932
- Skittles?
- No, a pot of gold!

32:32.106 --> 32:33.266
Treasure!

32:33.441 --> 32:35.875
- Awesome!
- Let's go!

32:37.612 --> 32:41.104
- Guys, look. It's the end of the rainbow.
- No way.

32:49.590 --> 32:51.717
Or the beginning of the rainbow.

32:51.893 --> 32:53.224
What?

32:53.394 --> 32:54.827
This rock wasn't here before.

32:54.996 --> 32:57.692
What if the rain dropped
the rock from the sky...

32:57.865 --> 33:00.163
...and the sun comes out,
hits the rock...

33:00.334 --> 33:03.895
...creating this prismatic separation
of the light from the sun...

33:04.071 --> 33:05.698
...thus causing a rainbow.

33:05.873 --> 33:07.204
Okay, Dr. Dumb Butt.

33:10.745 --> 33:12.337
Feels powerful.

33:12.513 --> 33:13.707
What do you think it is?

33:13.881 --> 33:15.314
I wish I knew.

33:18.686 --> 33:20.950
It's a wishing rock.

33:21.122 --> 33:22.555
How do you know?

33:22.723 --> 33:24.122
It just told me.

33:24.292 --> 33:25.987
Okay, then, wish for something.

33:28.195 --> 33:31.824
I wish for a never-ending supply
of chocolate bars.

33:32.099 --> 33:33.157
Huh?

33:36.437 --> 33:37.870
Well, there's one.

33:39.740 --> 33:41.401
And another and another.

33:41.576 --> 33:43.237
And two more. And another.

33:45.413 --> 33:49.816
- Cool. A never-ending pocketful of candy.
- Do you realize what we have here?

33:49.984 --> 33:52.885
- Lots of chocolate.
- No. This is...

33:53.054 --> 33:54.817
- Hey.
- This is mine.

33:54.989 --> 33:59.016
It was my idea to go on an adventure,
so the wishing rock belongs to me.

33:59.193 --> 34:02.128
Don't make any wishes, Loogie.
We don't even know the rules yet.

34:02.296 --> 34:05.163
I mean, that thing doesn't even
come with any instructions.

34:05.333 --> 34:09.063
Yeah, no strategy guide,
cheat codes, or nothing.

34:09.370 --> 34:11.099
I wish for the instructions.

34:12.505 --> 34:14.337
We can't read all that.

34:14.507 --> 34:16.976
I wish for the short version
of the instructions.

34:18.279 --> 34:20.042
What's it say?

34:21.415 --> 34:23.382
Pfft. "Make a wish."

34:23.551 --> 34:26.213
Then I wish for a fortress.

34:33.761 --> 34:36.559
With a canyon around it
filled with man-eating crocodiles...

34:36.731 --> 34:40.690
...and venomous snakes
to protect the Rainbow Rock from thieves.

34:42.536 --> 34:44.436
Whoa!

34:45.940 --> 34:48.237
How about putting an end
to global warming?

34:48.409 --> 34:50.138
World hunger?

34:50.311 --> 34:52.141
- Wish for world peace.
- Yeah.

34:52.313 --> 34:55.407
Let me finish my canyon of doom first.
People would kill for this.

34:55.583 --> 34:57.676
Not if there's world peace!

35:00.154 --> 35:03.783
I was about to wish for superpowers.

35:08.262 --> 35:10.594
I think one of us has to go get it.

35:10.765 --> 35:14.132
Well, you wanted an adventure, didn't you?

35:15.703 --> 35:17.500
What'd you wish for again?

35:17.672 --> 35:20.698
Snakes? Crocodiles?

35:20.875 --> 35:22.934
I think that's all.

35:23.110 --> 35:25.101
You don't like my canyon?

35:25.346 --> 35:27.177
Does it need more doom?

35:28.716 --> 35:31.583
Hey, look. It's the rock.

35:31.752 --> 35:33.185
Finally.

35:45.599 --> 35:46.623
Loogie.

35:47.168 --> 35:50.137
- Almost got it.
- No, it's almost got you.

35:50.304 --> 35:51.771
What? Aah!

35:59.714 --> 36:00.806
Run, Laser, run!

36:04.318 --> 36:06.912
Remind me to wish for something big!

36:07.088 --> 36:10.148
- What for?
- So I can smack you with it!

36:14.662 --> 36:15.686
What do I do?

36:15.863 --> 36:18.559
If it was a video game,
you'd go get the rock.

36:18.733 --> 36:21.133
- Good idea.
- But it's not a video game.

36:27.141 --> 36:28.335
Loogie!

36:35.416 --> 36:37.350
I wish the snakes would disappear.

36:45.860 --> 36:47.327
Did he chew?

36:47.495 --> 36:50.328
No. But he ate my homework.

36:50.498 --> 36:53.490
And I think I felt him make a wish.

36:53.667 --> 36:56.135
What would a crocodile possibly wish for?

36:56.303 --> 36:58.863
He's already strong, fast...

36:59.039 --> 37:02.372
...and he can run on all four legs.

37:03.878 --> 37:08.178
Guys, I think I know what he wished for.

37:12.453 --> 37:13.715
- Run!
- Aah!

37:19.059 --> 37:22.620
- Oh, no! We'll never make it!
- Yes, we will.

37:22.797 --> 37:24.992
Guys, keep running.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.337
Get us out of here.

37:36.977 --> 37:39.377
I wish something would take us away.

37:56.030 --> 37:59.295
A pterodactyl?
Couldn't you have been more specific?

37:59.466 --> 38:00.899
Hey, I didn't know.

38:01.068 --> 38:03.901
You're always wishing for wrong stuff.

38:09.543 --> 38:10.840
Thanks a lot, Loogie.

38:11.445 --> 38:13.606
At least we're safe up here.

38:15.349 --> 38:18.944
I don't get it.
How did they climb out of the canyon?

38:19.553 --> 38:21.214
Holy peanut-butter cups.

38:23.290 --> 38:27.249
- Great, now the baby's crying.
- We gotta get back. Wish us home.

38:32.066 --> 38:34.626
If I wish for superpowers,
I could get them to fall off.

38:34.802 --> 38:36.861
Hurry it up, whatever you do.

38:37.037 --> 38:39.198
I wish I had telephonesis.

38:43.210 --> 38:45.041
Telekinesis, you dummy!

38:45.212 --> 38:47.578
I wish I had telekinesis.

38:59.493 --> 39:01.256
Phew. Okay.

39:01.428 --> 39:06.456
We have a castle, telekinesis
and a pterodactyl.

39:06.634 --> 39:07.658
Now what?

39:07.835 --> 39:08.859
I don't know.

39:14.775 --> 39:16.572
Wish for a hat?

39:18.145 --> 39:20.773
Gotta think about this more carefully.

39:22.249 --> 39:25.548
I wish we could just go back home
and start over.

39:30.491 --> 39:33.085
It's too dangerous to have around.

39:33.260 --> 39:35.251
We gotta keep it
out of the wrong hands.

39:35.429 --> 39:38.330
Your hands are the wrong hands.

39:38.632 --> 39:40.122
Change your head back, Loogie.

39:40.467 --> 39:42.628
- This has certain advantages.
- What advantages?

39:44.104 --> 39:45.571
Hello?

39:47.942 --> 39:51.036
All right. I wish the phone was gone.

39:51.211 --> 39:54.305
Loogie, we need to be smart about this.

39:55.015 --> 39:57.040
Then that's the answer.

39:58.786 --> 40:00.913
- Ready?
- Yeah.

40:01.822 --> 40:04.985
I wish one of us was super smart.

40:09.530 --> 40:11.327
<i>It is I.</i>

40:12.499 --> 40:15.491
<i>My modes of transference</i>
<i>are beyond yours now.</i>

40:16.704 --> 40:19.172
<i>I don't need words to communicate.</i>

40:19.340 --> 40:21.535
<i>Only thoughts.</i>

40:22.042 --> 40:25.637
<i>You're hearing me with your minds.</i>

40:27.281 --> 40:28.839
You're right.

40:31.986 --> 40:33.851
I wish for a...

40:34.021 --> 40:35.045
...catapult.

40:38.759 --> 40:41.023
- Think of all the things we could do.
- Too risky.

40:41.195 --> 40:42.389
- We could...
- Too dangerous.

40:42.563 --> 40:44.531
- How about...?
- Too ridiculous.

40:46.600 --> 40:50.229
Although we did have ourselves
quite the adventure there, didn't we?

40:50.871 --> 40:53.101
We could take care of
that world-peace problem.

40:53.273 --> 40:55.707
- Now you're talking.
- Yeah.

41:03.550 --> 41:08.453
<i>My calculations show you would've</i>
<i>figured out a way to screw it up.</i>

41:08.622 --> 41:10.283
Who, us?

41:12.893 --> 41:14.360
<i>Yes.</i>

41:15.062 --> 41:17.587
<i>So maybe</i>
<i>the baby was smart to get rid of it.</i>

41:17.765 --> 41:19.392
<i>But it didn't really matter...</i>

41:19.566 --> 41:24.128
<i>... because the rock kept coming back.</i>

41:27.775 --> 41:29.743
Get me a rock!

41:29.910 --> 41:32.208
- Where's my rock?
- Here.

41:32.379 --> 41:36.907
<i>I'm sorry. I'm still not getting</i>
<i>the order of this story correctly...</i>

41:37.084 --> 41:39.985
<i>... so I'm gonna jump on over</i>
<i>to this short...</i>

41:40.154 --> 41:42.645
<i>... with that weird kid</i>
<i>I was telling you about...</i>

41:42.823 --> 41:45.849
<i>... a kid everyone calls "Nose."</i>

41:46.026 --> 41:47.789
<i>Nose and I were in school together.</i>

41:47.961 --> 41:49.758
<i>We were almost friends...</i>

41:49.930 --> 41:53.798
<i>... until his father, Dr. Noseworthy,</i>
<i>the top scientist for Black, Inc...</i>

41:53.967 --> 41:57.061
<i>... started his top-secret research</i>
<i>involving...</i>

41:57.237 --> 41:58.568
<i>... germs.</i>

41:58.739 --> 42:02.903
<i>Unfortunately, Dr. Noseworthy</i>
<i>was terrified of germs...</i>

42:03.077 --> 42:05.773
<i>... and one day, he simply flipped out.</i>

42:16.190 --> 42:18.954
<i>So much so that he and his son, Nose...</i>

42:19.126 --> 42:23.927
<i>... wrapped their house in plastic</i>
<i>and only came out wearing full bio suits.</i>

42:26.667 --> 42:30.626
<i>And that's just how things were:</i>
<i>a little weird.</i>

42:30.804 --> 42:32.863
<i>But like everything else in Black Falls...</i>

42:35.175 --> 42:38.110
<i>... about to get a little weirder.</i>

43:03.237 --> 43:04.829
<i>Welcome to the Noseworthy home.</i>

43:05.005 --> 43:06.836
<i>You will be subjected</i>
<i>to decontamination...</i>

43:07.007 --> 43:09.168
<i>... before entering</i>
<i>our germ-free environment.</i>

43:09.343 --> 43:11.573
<i>You are now receiving</i>
<i>a series of ion blasts...</i>

43:11.745 --> 43:14.805
<i>... to remove any contaminants</i>
<i>from the surface of your body.</i>

43:15.048 --> 43:17.676
<i>Germs invade our bodies</i>
<i>to steal the energy we produce...</i>

43:17.851 --> 43:21.719
<i>... leaving behind harmful toxins that can</i>
<i>cause runny noses, fevers, headaches...</i>

43:21.889 --> 43:25.188
<i>... chicken pox, measles, cavities,</i>
<i>diarrhea, necrotizing fasciitis...</i>

43:25.359 --> 43:27.486
<i>... and in some cases, death.</i>

43:27.661 --> 43:29.891
<i>The decontamination process</i>
<i>is now complete.</i>

43:30.664 --> 43:32.154
<i>You may enter.</i>

43:32.799 --> 43:33.823
<i>And welcome.</i>

43:34.001 --> 43:37.402
They do not pay me enough for this.

43:58.058 --> 43:59.389
Dad?

44:01.695 --> 44:04.095
Didn't I tell you,
don't sneak up on me in here.

44:04.464 --> 44:06.125
Sorry, my tutor is here.

44:06.300 --> 44:09.895
I was just looking for your scientific
calculator. Mine's broken.

44:10.070 --> 44:13.972
Just use your Black Box. Just choose the
scientific calculator function in the menu.

44:14.141 --> 44:15.608
It's next to the cheese grater.

44:15.776 --> 44:18.574
Mine's dead.
I just think there's too many features.

44:18.745 --> 44:20.212
The batteries won't hold a charge...

44:20.380 --> 44:23.406
...for more than a few minutes.
- Tell me something I don't know.

44:23.617 --> 44:26.711
But let me ask you something.
Have you been keeping yourself clean?

44:27.554 --> 44:28.851
Huh?

44:30.324 --> 44:33.418
- Of course.
- Oh, boy.

44:33.594 --> 44:35.152
If you could see what I can see.

44:35.329 --> 44:36.796
Oh, my goodness.

44:39.566 --> 44:40.658
Yeah.

44:40.834 --> 44:43.428
All right, I can't have any more
interruptions today.

44:43.604 --> 44:45.936
I've got to readjust the cell regulator.

44:46.106 --> 44:48.904
I tried recalibrating
the mitochondrial synthesizer...

44:49.076 --> 44:52.568
...but I just can't get it to live
in an extracellular environment.

44:52.746 --> 44:53.770
And on top of it all...

44:54.548 --> 44:57.779
What are you do...?
How many times do I have to tell you?

44:57.951 --> 44:59.179
Don't pick your nose.

44:59.353 --> 45:01.981
It is completely unsanitary.

45:02.155 --> 45:03.588
If your nose is full...

45:03.757 --> 45:07.124
...you go into the bathroom
and you clean it out with antiseptic wipes.

45:07.294 --> 45:09.262
But... Booger!

45:09.429 --> 45:13.297
Boogers are like fecal material.

45:13.467 --> 45:15.731
Your body is trying to get rid of it.

45:15.902 --> 45:19.804
It pushes it up, up, up, out,
and then pop.

45:19.973 --> 45:22.373
But what do you do?
You put it back in your mouth.

45:22.542 --> 45:25.739
Back into the system.
And it has to start all over again.

45:25.912 --> 45:26.936
I'm sorry.

45:28.081 --> 45:31.312
Mankind has been evolving
too many millennia for you to reingest...

45:31.485 --> 45:33.112
Okay!

45:33.954 --> 45:35.945
Go wash your hands
with antibacterial soap.

45:36.123 --> 45:38.557
- And make sure you use the...
- Antiseptic wipes?

45:38.725 --> 45:41.250
Yes, the wipes. And...

45:44.097 --> 45:46.531
...I'm gonna go take a nap.

45:54.274 --> 45:57.766
Excuse you. How can you be late
to school when it's in your own house?

45:57.944 --> 46:00.344
I was getting my calculator.

46:00.714 --> 46:03.308
- What's that?
- It's just some kind of rock.

46:03.483 --> 46:06.077
You can have it if you want.
It's been decontaminated.

46:14.728 --> 46:18.528
Okay, well, today we're gonna do
fractional inconsistencies.

46:26.406 --> 46:29.500
- What's it like out there today?
- Don't you look out the window?

46:29.676 --> 46:34.579
I have security video screens, but they
don't really show the color of the sky.

46:35.749 --> 46:38.343
You know, you could just go outside.

46:38.518 --> 46:40.543
I mean, a little fresh air won't kill you.

46:40.721 --> 46:44.088
Are you crazy? So-called fresh air
is loaded with pollutants.

46:44.257 --> 46:46.725
On top of that,
you've got the ozone washed in UV...

46:46.893 --> 46:49.361
...allergens and all kinds of impurities.

46:50.197 --> 46:52.324
At least that's what Dad says.

46:52.499 --> 46:53.625
And I agree.

46:53.800 --> 46:55.028
What's up with your dad?

46:55.202 --> 47:00.037
Stress. Something about
a, uh, mitochondrial relay.

47:00.874 --> 47:06.813
I just wish that his inventions worked
the way they were supposed to.

47:15.288 --> 47:16.380
What's he doing here?

47:18.158 --> 47:19.386
<i>Nose!</i>

47:20.794 --> 47:23.991
You haven't come to visit in almost a year.
I should break your arms.

47:24.164 --> 47:27.463
<i>But it looks like someone beat me to it.</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

47:27.634 --> 47:32.071
Ah, I'm sorry about that,
but I've lost something very important.

47:32.239 --> 47:35.208
- It looks like it came in your direction.
- It's not a good time.

47:38.178 --> 47:41.739
<i>It's a rock. It looks like a rainbow</i>
<i>and it's this big.</i>

47:41.915 --> 47:44.281
<i>How would I have it?</i>
<i>I never leave this place.</i>

47:44.451 --> 47:45.645
Gotta go, bye.

47:47.988 --> 47:50.115
Ugh, he's a virus. Okay, back to work.

47:50.290 --> 47:51.780
I know he's your brother, but...

47:51.958 --> 47:55.689
Yeah, he's been my personal parasite
since he wiggled out of the womb.

48:02.803 --> 48:03.827
What was that?

48:04.004 --> 48:07.030
Dad's breaking things in the lab again.
Let me go check on him.

48:13.480 --> 48:14.606
Help me up.

48:14.781 --> 48:16.874
What are you doing?
He said he didn't have it.

48:17.050 --> 48:19.780
- Well, he must've been lying.
- How can you tell?

48:19.953 --> 48:22.854
- Because his lips were moving.
- Are you crazy?

48:23.056 --> 48:27.356
We have to get that rock back
or else nothing will ever be right again.

48:30.897 --> 48:34.333
No, no, no!
You'll contaminate my house.

48:35.602 --> 48:37.160
Dad?

48:54.754 --> 48:55.778
- What...
- Aah!

48:55.956 --> 48:58.618
- are contaminators doing in my ho...?

48:59.826 --> 49:02.192
You? You gave me this headache.

49:02.362 --> 49:05.593
You and that rock
almost ruined last night.

49:05.765 --> 49:09.599
Here. Wipe yourselves down right now.
Immediately. Turn around.

49:09.769 --> 49:12.829
Give me your foot.
Oh, look at that. Filthy.

49:14.641 --> 49:17.166
Toby, what are you doing here?
You want me to lose my job?

49:18.144 --> 49:20.510
Well, hello. I'm Loogie.

49:23.683 --> 49:26.948
- There's something in there.
- What is that rock doing in my house?

49:27.120 --> 49:28.917
Nose, give me that rock now.

49:29.389 --> 49:32.187
No, no, no,
out of the house. Get it out of here.

49:32.359 --> 49:34.293
Get it out, out, out. Move it.

49:43.436 --> 49:46.894
That's the second time
that rock's been eaten.

49:55.448 --> 49:57.040
What is that thing?

49:57.217 --> 49:58.912
My booger.

49:59.653 --> 50:02.918
- You pulled that out of your nose?
- Uh...

50:03.857 --> 50:04.949
Ew.

50:05.125 --> 50:10.062
I've told you a million times
not to pick your nose.

50:11.064 --> 50:12.122
See what happens?

50:15.435 --> 50:18.427
Your invention works.
My wish came true.

50:18.905 --> 50:21.738
It does, doesn't it?

50:23.677 --> 50:24.837
But wait a minute.

50:25.011 --> 50:29.141
It must've tripped the chromosomal relay
on the cell regulator, but that means...

50:30.517 --> 50:32.576
...it's gotta keep feeding to stay intact.

50:32.752 --> 50:34.014
So basically...

50:34.588 --> 50:38.251
...all those years you told me
not to eat my boogers?

50:39.626 --> 50:42.424
Yes, now your booger
is trying to eat you.

50:44.331 --> 50:47.061
- Aah!
- Decontamination chamber! Run!

50:48.602 --> 50:51.093
Wait! We gotta go back for the rock!

50:51.271 --> 50:53.637
Forget it, we've lost this round.

50:53.840 --> 50:58.140
Son, you get them out of here. I've gotta
go back for the cellular devolumizer.

51:11.725 --> 51:14.285
One at a time. One at a time.

51:16.696 --> 51:18.186
Ladies first.

51:22.836 --> 51:26.101
<i>You are now leaving the safe,</i>
<i>sterile environment of our home.</i>

51:27.907 --> 51:30.068
Well, hello, again.

51:30.677 --> 51:31.701
You're next.

51:35.982 --> 51:37.973
I... I gotta get the rock!

51:42.555 --> 51:44.682
Nose, help him. Do something.
He's gonna die. Help Toe.

51:44.858 --> 51:47.190
Think, think, think.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.191
Your booger's warm.

51:56.169 --> 51:58.364
If you eat my friend...

51:59.172 --> 52:02.938
...I'll eat yours.

52:04.310 --> 52:06.437
Believe me, he will.

52:07.013 --> 52:09.106
Uh-huh.

52:17.857 --> 52:19.256
Come on.

52:24.364 --> 52:25.956
Come on! What are you waiting for?

52:26.132 --> 52:28.566
I haven't been outside in years.
I'm afraid.

52:29.636 --> 52:30.694
Nose!

52:31.137 --> 52:34.470
I know, I know. But I'm just not ready.

52:35.975 --> 52:38.239
Okay, now I'm ready!

52:44.317 --> 52:45.579
Dad!

53:21.488 --> 53:22.512
Are you okay?

53:23.189 --> 53:25.851
- He's not breathing.
- Breathe, Nose, breathe.

53:26.025 --> 53:29.927
If a giant booger monster couldn't kill you,
what's a breath of fresh air gonna do?

53:30.130 --> 53:32.462
- Breathe!
- Breathe!

53:35.935 --> 53:38.369
I can breathe! I did it!

53:42.342 --> 53:44.276
It was nice seeing you, Nose.

53:44.444 --> 53:46.776
I promise I'll call you!

53:48.948 --> 53:51.109
Dad, can you believe it?

53:51.284 --> 53:54.947
No, I can't.
This is gonna make a great specimen.

53:56.322 --> 53:59.985
I mean us. We're outside. We're okay.

54:00.160 --> 54:03.220
You're right. I didn't explode.

54:03.396 --> 54:07.457
Huh. I'm gonna have to rethink
my theory of instant exposure.

54:07.667 --> 54:09.567
But what do you have to say about this?

54:10.870 --> 54:11.962
Bad booger.

54:12.138 --> 54:13.696
Hey.

54:14.040 --> 54:18.101
I mean, no more picking
and from now on...

54:18.278 --> 54:21.008
...antiseptic wipes.
- Antiseptic wipes.

54:21.181 --> 54:22.205
Good.

54:29.155 --> 54:31.749
<i>I got ahead of myself again.</i>

54:32.358 --> 54:33.586
<i>But I just remembered...</i>

54:33.760 --> 54:36.695
<i>... how the rock changed</i>
<i>my mom and dad.</i>

54:38.131 --> 54:40.565
<i>Boy, did it ever.</i>

54:45.505 --> 54:48.804
Your parents are coming to the costume
party at my dad's house tonight.

54:48.975 --> 54:51.239
- I know.
- You coming too?

54:51.411 --> 54:52.503
No.

54:53.313 --> 54:55.611
- Good.
- Bye.

54:55.782 --> 54:57.545
HELVETICA
<i>Wait!</i>

54:57.717 --> 54:59.981
- Have you told them about me?
- <i>What would I tell them?</i>

55:00.153 --> 55:03.748
Mom, Dad, there's a girl at my school
who stuffs me in a trash can every day.

55:03.923 --> 55:08.087
- You know, the one who broke my arms.
- Heh, that's funny.

55:08.261 --> 55:11.287
Don't come over
and don't say anything about me.

55:11.464 --> 55:15.059
I won't say anything about you.

55:18.638 --> 55:21.903
Oh, you're texting me hugs and kisses.

55:22.075 --> 55:25.135
Why don't you just kiss me?
We're in the same room together.

55:25.311 --> 55:28.075
Why are you texting me?
What happened to two people talking?

55:28.248 --> 55:32.651
Maybe this doesn't apply to Team B, but
Team A lives in a fast-paced, 24/7 world.

55:32.819 --> 55:36.186
These gadgets, made by the company
we work for, are to keep us connected.

55:36.356 --> 55:40.053
But we're disconnected. Don't you see?

55:40.226 --> 55:42.990
It needs to work better.
Or we need to work better.

55:43.162 --> 55:45.062
We don't even know
who our son's girlfriend is.

55:45.231 --> 55:46.493
So we just spy on him.

55:46.666 --> 55:49.601
That's a new feature I'm adding:
spy on your kids. I'll have an answer.

55:49.769 --> 55:51.669
That's not a relationship.

55:52.005 --> 55:55.907
- You want me to put it away?
- No, I didn't say that.

55:56.309 --> 56:00.075
I like my phone, e-mail, text messages,
movies, music, ham radio.

56:00.246 --> 56:02.271
It's the world at my fingertips. I just...

56:04.484 --> 56:06.850
It's just I've...

56:07.020 --> 56:08.612
...got mail.

56:16.195 --> 56:18.026
- Don't open that.
- Don't get that.

56:23.303 --> 56:25.828
- I really have to take this.
- I really have to get this.

56:26.005 --> 56:28.098
See, you proved my point.

56:30.009 --> 56:32.500
I still think we ought to be closer.

56:49.696 --> 56:51.129
Mom?

56:51.764 --> 56:53.732
- What are you doing?
- Um...

56:53.900 --> 56:54.992
I was just...

56:58.938 --> 57:01.133
I was just looking for my compact.

57:01.641 --> 57:02.665
What do you think?

57:03.443 --> 57:07.140
Miss Communication. Get it?

57:07.313 --> 57:08.405
It fits.

57:09.015 --> 57:12.576
We'll be home after bedtime.
Take it easy on your sister.

57:23.229 --> 57:24.662
You look stupid.

57:24.831 --> 57:26.264
So do you.

57:26.432 --> 57:30.425
What did I tell you two?
That's not how you treat people.

57:30.603 --> 57:33.936
Courtesy, consideration, respect.

57:34.774 --> 57:37.368
You know it. Now do it.

57:37.543 --> 57:39.101
- Yes, Dad.
- Yes, Dad.

57:40.179 --> 57:42.409
Stop calling me!

57:42.582 --> 57:43.742
I never call you.

57:43.916 --> 57:45.178
Loogie?

57:45.351 --> 57:47.342
I figured out
where your friends came from.

57:47.620 --> 57:50.521
<i>It was a rock, a rainbow-colored rock.</i>

57:50.690 --> 57:52.624
You make a wish
and then it comes true.

57:52.792 --> 57:55.124
<i>You must have found it. Where is it?</i>

57:58.164 --> 58:00.428
- Mom.
- <i>Hello?</i>

58:02.235 --> 58:03.725
I'm not your mom.

58:04.103 --> 58:07.766
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
But you growing is not important, okay?

58:07.940 --> 58:09.874
I don't care how big your feet are now.

58:12.345 --> 58:14.336
Remember our honeymoon?

58:16.416 --> 58:18.316
I gotta take this call.

58:18.484 --> 58:21.976
If I can get this guy onboard,
I can make all our wishes come true.

58:23.322 --> 58:25.256
- Tulum.
- Right.

58:25.425 --> 58:26.949
We could go back there, you know.

58:27.126 --> 58:29.993
There's no phones, no emails,
no text messaging, no Black Box.

58:30.163 --> 58:31.596
It's just the two of us.

58:31.764 --> 58:35.962
We did yoga together.
We did yoga together. We had bala...

58:36.903 --> 58:40.202
Call dropped. Stupid phone feature.

58:40.373 --> 58:42.398
Meh, he'll call back.

58:42.575 --> 58:44.770
A little help up here, pal.

58:52.585 --> 58:54.610
I just wish we were closer.

58:54.787 --> 58:55.811
Right.

58:57.623 --> 59:00.387
- Really close.
- Mm-hm.

59:04.730 --> 59:06.664
What just happened?

59:09.435 --> 59:11.096
- We can't go in there!
- Of course we can't!

59:11.270 --> 59:13.795
How is Mr. Black gonna take me seriously
wearing your dress?

59:13.973 --> 59:15.565
Someone's coming!

59:19.479 --> 59:21.242
Shh!

59:25.952 --> 59:28.216
Helvetica, someone rang the doorbell
and ran off.

59:28.387 --> 59:30.355
Are you making enemies again?

59:30.523 --> 59:33.048
Well, you see, there's this boy...

59:33.226 --> 59:36.627
If they come back, let me handle it.
Not you. Understood?

59:38.631 --> 59:40.565
- Change us back.
- I didn't do this.

59:40.733 --> 59:43.463
You said you wanted us to be closer
and then, zap, we were.

59:43.636 --> 59:44.728
Now change us back.

59:44.904 --> 59:47.338
I want us to be back
the way we were too.

59:48.241 --> 59:51.438
You must have done something wrong.
Typical B-Team work.

59:51.644 --> 59:54.704
- Somebody's trying to teach us a lesson.
- About what, anatomy?

59:56.149 --> 01:00:00.449
- That's me. That's my guy. I can't...
- Let it go to voicemail, for crying out loud.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.315
I've been waiting for this call all night.

01:00:12.365 --> 01:00:13.423
What you looking for?

01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:14.623
Ow!

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.392
What did you do that one for?

01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:19.367
I warned you to stay away,
Toe Thompson!

01:00:19.539 --> 01:00:21.404
- My name is Toby!
- Helvetica.

01:00:23.409 --> 01:00:24.535
Why all the shouting?

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:27.804
Oh. Dad, this is Toe. I mean, Toby.

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.278
He was just coming by
to bring me my math homework.

01:00:31.384 --> 01:00:33.113
Please accept my apologies, young man.

01:00:33.286 --> 01:00:36.517
My daughter has the habit of
bringing unwanted attention upon herself.

01:00:36.689 --> 01:00:38.418
- Dad.
- Hel.

01:00:39.692 --> 01:00:42.661
Take him inside,
put some ice on his head.

01:00:42.828 --> 01:00:44.523
We'll talk about this later.

01:00:44.697 --> 01:00:45.857
Let's go, Hel.

01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:51.297
Now stay still.

01:00:56.142 --> 01:00:57.268
What are you doing here?

01:00:58.911 --> 01:01:02.108
Came here to get my mom's purse.

01:01:03.849 --> 01:01:06.374
- Thanks for the ice. Bye.
- Wait. Don't go.

01:01:06.552 --> 01:01:07.951
Let go of the wishing rock.

01:01:09.322 --> 01:01:11.984
- Wishing rock? How does it work?
- I said fishing rock.

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:22.392
Heh, heh. Two points.

01:01:22.568 --> 01:01:25.867
You stupid excuse for a brother.

01:01:26.038 --> 01:01:30.634
I wish you were
a stupid little dung beetle.

01:01:35.514 --> 01:01:36.572
Did you see that?

01:01:37.016 --> 01:01:38.040
Wow.

01:01:43.155 --> 01:01:46.488
- We have to go get that rock.
- And how are we gonna do that?

01:01:48.494 --> 01:01:51.486
Mr. and Mrs. Thompson,
excellent costume.

01:01:51.998 --> 01:01:54.990
Pity we aren't giving out prizes.
Come in.

01:01:58.404 --> 01:02:00.031
Wait a minute.

01:02:02.408 --> 01:02:05.434
- Aren't you on opposing teams?
- Yes.

01:02:06.012 --> 01:02:09.345
But I'm still his better half, so...

01:02:09.515 --> 01:02:11.142
"Miscommunication."

01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:13.843
Our theme for the night.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.649
If you would please join the others,
I'll be addressing everyone shortly.

01:02:22.528 --> 01:02:26.157
So far, so good.
Nobody's really noticed us.

01:02:26.332 --> 01:02:27.356
Just don't trip.

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:32.703
I'm gonna change you back.

01:02:32.872 --> 01:02:37.104
Just stay here so you don't get squished
and quit your whining.

01:02:37.777 --> 01:02:39.677
Give me my rock back.

01:02:39.845 --> 01:02:41.745
My brother's a bug.

01:02:41.914 --> 01:02:43.176
So, what's new?

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.415
The rock's out there somewhere.

01:02:46.585 --> 01:02:49.748
Stay here while I go get it.

01:02:49.922 --> 01:02:55.019
Nope. We go together.
Like Siamese twins.

01:02:55.194 --> 01:02:56.889
I'll need everyone's attention.

01:02:57.129 --> 01:03:02.431
The fate of Version X of the Black Box
lies in the hands of two teams.

01:03:02.601 --> 01:03:05.729
I made a promise to myself
and more importantly the world...

01:03:05.905 --> 01:03:08.567
...that I would never release
an upgrade...

01:03:08.741 --> 01:03:11.869
...that didn't meet
our highest standards of wow.

01:03:12.845 --> 01:03:16.679
The winning team will be showered
with accolades...

01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:20.080
...and the losers get a one-way ticket
to Canned City.

01:03:20.252 --> 01:03:22.311
- I'll need the representatives...
- That's us.

01:03:22.488 --> 01:03:25.218
...from Team A and Team B
to step up here now.

01:03:29.428 --> 01:03:31.521
Can you stand a little further apart?

01:03:31.697 --> 01:03:35.497
We can't very well fire just one of you
if you're standing together as one.

01:03:52.385 --> 01:03:56.185
Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer, eh?

01:03:57.757 --> 01:04:01.215
Now that's the honest go-for-the-throat
spirit I'm talking about.

01:04:07.266 --> 01:04:13.933
I wish each and every one of you
had that same go-for-the-throat spirit.

01:04:23.082 --> 01:04:24.106
What are you doing?

01:04:26.685 --> 01:04:28.175
What's happening?

01:04:29.755 --> 01:04:31.746
Have you all gone mad?

01:04:45.337 --> 01:04:48.204
- Aah! My back is going out.
- No, your back is not going out.

01:04:55.414 --> 01:04:57.974
Thompson!
Do you know what's happening?

01:04:58.651 --> 01:05:02.087
I believe Team A has discovered
the solution to the upgrade problem.

01:05:02.254 --> 01:05:04.654
That's the solution
to our little problem, remember?

01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:07.558
We've got the rock now, Dad.

01:05:07.726 --> 01:05:09.990
We can have anything we want.

01:05:10.162 --> 01:05:11.322
Just wish for it.

01:05:11.497 --> 01:05:13.556
This is all your doing,
isn't it, young lady?

01:05:13.732 --> 01:05:15.029
No, Dad, just listen.

01:05:15.201 --> 01:05:20.229
We're here to talk about a box!
A Black Box, not a round colorful rock.

01:05:20.406 --> 01:05:22.738
This box needs to be able
to do everything.

01:05:22.908 --> 01:05:24.808
That's what this does.

01:05:24.977 --> 01:05:27.912
That's the last straw. Helvetica,
go to your room, don't ever come out!

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.483
No! I wish you would
just listen to me for a change.

01:05:39.892 --> 01:05:42.383
I wish these casts were off.

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.255
Not his, just mine.

01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:49.725
Shh!

01:05:50.836 --> 01:05:53.396
I wish for a rocket bike.

01:05:57.009 --> 01:05:59.273
I know what it's like
to feel that no one's listening.

01:05:59.445 --> 01:06:00.742
That no one's your friend.

01:06:02.114 --> 01:06:03.809
But Helvetica...

01:06:03.983 --> 01:06:05.780
...I'm your friend.

01:06:06.385 --> 01:06:08.285
I don't need friends.

01:06:11.857 --> 01:06:13.882
See you, stooges.

01:06:31.377 --> 01:06:33.208
We're not riding that.

01:06:40.653 --> 01:06:43.554
See? Teamwork. Togetherness.

01:06:43.722 --> 01:06:44.916
We're connecting.

01:06:58.137 --> 01:07:00.230
Would you look at that?

01:07:05.878 --> 01:07:08.142
- Turn left.
- My left or your left?

01:07:08.314 --> 01:07:10.179
It's the same thing, isn't it?

01:07:19.658 --> 01:07:23.025
We are so not connected.

01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:56.125
I wish you were all back to normal!

01:08:08.107 --> 01:08:10.098
Well, obviously someone spiked
the Kool-Aid.

01:08:11.477 --> 01:08:13.468
You'll remember none of this
in the morning.

01:08:18.117 --> 01:08:20.915
Give me that rock back.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:27.049
Or I'll break every other bone
in your body.

01:08:27.926 --> 01:08:29.518
You wish.

01:08:39.004 --> 01:08:42.770
Where is that funny little stone
of yours?

01:08:42.941 --> 01:08:45.432
That idiot threw it...

01:08:45.611 --> 01:08:48.636
...clear over there somewhere.

01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:51.173
Did he?

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:02.015
Guess we're back
to our old separate selves.

01:09:02.194 --> 01:09:03.491
We don't have to be.

01:09:03.662 --> 01:09:06.654
- That rock could have gotten one of us...
- We don't need the rock.

01:09:06.832 --> 01:09:09.823
We just have to go to Mr. Black
and tell him no competing teams.

01:09:10.002 --> 01:09:12.937
We are not gonna work
against each other anymore.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:18.468
Two heads are better than one.

01:09:18.644 --> 01:09:20.236
Strike a balance?

01:09:21.345 --> 01:09:22.870
Connected?

01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:25.281
Completely.

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:28.916
Don't get that.

01:09:30.555 --> 01:09:32.386
I won't.

01:09:38.596 --> 01:09:41.031
<i>All right, you get the idea.</i>

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.135
<i>They learned their lesson</i>
<i>and decided that from now on...</i>

01:09:44.303 --> 01:09:46.567
<i>... they would truly stand together.</i>

01:09:48.372 --> 01:09:51.341
<i>They were gonna need it</i>
<i>where they were headed.</i>

01:09:52.444 --> 01:09:53.911
<i>We all were.</i>

01:10:00.586 --> 01:10:02.645
- Breathe!
- Breathe!

01:10:08.827 --> 01:10:10.317
It was nice seeing you, Nose.

01:10:10.496 --> 01:10:13.192
I promise I'll call you!

01:10:13.365 --> 01:10:16.960
- Can't believe we got the rock.
- I know. What should we wish for first?

01:10:17.136 --> 01:10:19.263
First I wish these casts were off.

01:10:21.473 --> 01:10:23.532
The rock's potential is bigger than us.

01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:26.269
We gotta be careful and start by... Aah!

01:10:28.747 --> 01:10:30.806
Handing it over to me.

01:10:30.983 --> 01:10:35.249
Cole. I think we're gonna need
another trash can.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.944
It must be Christmas.

01:10:37.122 --> 01:10:41.388
- Hey, she has a rock just like ours.
- That is ours, you dummy.

01:10:42.594 --> 01:10:44.391
- Hey, guys.
- Look who it is.

01:10:44.563 --> 01:10:47.691
Everybody's favorite
booger-eating germophobe.

01:10:47.866 --> 01:10:50.027
What are you doing outside, bubble boy?

01:10:50.202 --> 01:10:53.137
Yeah. What did you wish for, guts?

01:10:53.605 --> 01:10:56.199
No. He came out on his own.

01:10:56.375 --> 01:10:59.173
He didn't need the rock. Ew.

01:10:59.878 --> 01:11:02.813
That's right, I'm not afraid
of anything anymore.

01:11:02.981 --> 01:11:04.539
Not even you, typeface.

01:11:19.865 --> 01:11:21.730
Put the rock on the ground
and step away.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.095
Dad, what are you doing?

01:11:24.269 --> 01:11:27.102
- Grab the rock and make a wish.
- It's all for the best, Helvetica.

01:11:27.272 --> 01:11:30.332
Uh-uh. My wishes keep backfiring.
You do it.

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:33.844
Get it! Helvetica! Do whatever it takes!

01:11:34.012 --> 01:11:37.243
- I thought you told me not to be a bully.
- It's not bullying if you win.

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:39.179
Oh, I hate being told what to do.

01:11:39.985 --> 01:11:41.543
Should we follow them, sir?

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.017
I know where they're going.

01:11:43.188 --> 01:11:44.621
I wish... I wish...

01:11:45.557 --> 01:11:47.616
I wish I could fly!

01:11:52.965 --> 01:11:56.059
- I got it.
- Where could he be?

01:11:56.235 --> 01:12:00.296
He'll be fine. I'm sure he's just out
playing with his new friends.

01:12:05.377 --> 01:12:07.607
- You'll never get it.
- It's my rock.

01:12:07.779 --> 01:12:10.407
- No, it's not.
- Give it to me.

01:12:10.582 --> 01:12:12.209
I wish for really long arms.

01:12:16.722 --> 01:12:18.952
I wish to disappear.

01:12:19.124 --> 01:12:20.318
She's invisible.

01:12:22.628 --> 01:12:25.791
Get it. Run. Hurry up.

01:12:34.573 --> 01:12:37.474
Reverse invisibility
and arms back to normal.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.541
You know, I always did like you, Laser.

01:12:45.717 --> 01:12:46.741
Really?

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.144
Liked.

01:12:50.856 --> 01:12:52.153
Curbside delivery.

01:12:52.324 --> 01:12:54.053
Uh, gather round.

01:12:54.226 --> 01:12:55.488
You'll wanna hear this.

01:12:56.361 --> 01:12:57.623
You're all fired.

01:12:57.796 --> 01:13:00.822
This small stone is
the ultimate Black Box...

01:13:00.999 --> 01:13:03.297
...the only upgrade we'll ever need.

01:13:03.468 --> 01:13:04.992
Wait. Why even bother?

01:13:05.170 --> 01:13:07.195
I could just forget about the business
altogether...

01:13:07.372 --> 01:13:10.603
...and simply wish
for a giant pile of money.

01:13:19.518 --> 01:13:22.351
You see, black becomes colorful...

01:13:22.521 --> 01:13:26.958
...square becomes round
and you become obsolete!

01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:30.652
I've got all I need right here.

01:13:30.829 --> 01:13:31.887
But what about me, Dad?

01:13:32.597 --> 01:13:37.364
Oh. Well, you, okay. You can come too.
And you too, Cole.

01:13:41.273 --> 01:13:44.800
Come on, Dad. You must be joking.

01:13:44.977 --> 01:13:49.346
My girl, I wish I were.

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:05.289
Wish me down.
I'm rehiring you at double your salary.

01:14:05.464 --> 01:14:09.059
I don't need your money, Mr. Black.
I've got the rock.

01:14:09.234 --> 01:14:13.330
The adults are gonna wreck this place
for sure. We gotta stop them.

01:14:13.505 --> 01:14:15.063
- Right.
- Right.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.105
Stay back! Stay back!

01:14:18.744 --> 01:14:22.111
I wish I were...

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.407
An Oscar Mayer wiener!

01:14:33.759 --> 01:14:36.922
You! I'll give you $ 10
if you help me down.

01:14:37.095 --> 01:14:38.585
- All right.
- Gingerly.

01:14:45.237 --> 01:14:46.397
John?

01:14:48.073 --> 01:14:50.940
Hey. You got your wish.

01:14:51.109 --> 01:14:52.872
I'm all grown up.

01:15:02.254 --> 01:15:04.381
Well, hello, I'm Loogie.

01:15:04.556 --> 01:15:05.921
Also known as:

01:15:09.861 --> 01:15:11.385
Enough.

01:15:15.867 --> 01:15:20.770
I wish that I were
the most powerful thing...

01:15:21.206 --> 01:15:23.538
...in the entire world.

01:15:55.774 --> 01:15:59.005
We have to take turns
using the rock to stop him.

01:15:59.177 --> 01:16:03.113
- Cole, he's our dad, so you and me first.
- What?

01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:06.011
He needs our help.
He's become drunk with power.

01:16:07.619 --> 01:16:11.385
I wish I were a giant wasp.

01:16:11.556 --> 01:16:13.922
Male stuffing!

01:16:20.265 --> 01:16:23.063
I wish I was a giant...

01:16:27.439 --> 01:16:29.464
Stuff, stuff, stuff.

01:16:31.376 --> 01:16:36.643
Missed me. Missed me.
I'll teach you to listen to your Helvetica.

01:16:37.616 --> 01:16:39.140
Dung beetle?

01:16:40.819 --> 01:16:43.083
All right, Dad, here I come.

01:16:43.989 --> 01:16:48.653
How dare you attack your father?

01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:52.988
You blinked!

01:16:53.165 --> 01:16:56.657
Thirty-five hours, 15 minutes
and 20 seconds...

01:16:56.835 --> 01:16:58.268
...and you blinked!

01:16:58.436 --> 01:17:01.997
You lose, loser.

01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:08.841
We need backup.
I wish for my alien friends.

01:17:20.992 --> 01:17:23.460
I wish for my crocodile army.

01:17:29.234 --> 01:17:31.794
Bill. There's a baby out there.

01:17:50.121 --> 01:17:51.611
<i>Stop.</i>

01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:02.095
- <i>You've made the rock angry.</i>
- What?

01:18:02.267 --> 01:18:06.966
<i>It has given life to your petty desires,</i>
<i>but you continue to break its laws.</i>

01:18:07.138 --> 01:18:09.003
Why are we listening to a baby?

01:18:11.276 --> 01:18:14.439
<i>In your greedy hands,</i>
<i>it could mean the end of the world...</i>

01:18:14.613 --> 01:18:16.774
<i>... even the end of the universe.</i>

01:18:16.948 --> 01:18:19.815
- What's wrong?
- <i>The rock grows weary.</i>

01:18:19.985 --> 01:18:23.853
<i>It cannot sustain this strain</i>
<i>on its powers.</i>

01:18:37.035 --> 01:18:41.028
<i>We have to get rid of the rock</i>
<i>or it will destroy us all.</i>

01:18:41.206 --> 01:18:42.696
- How?
- I've got it.

01:18:42.874 --> 01:18:45.672
It's something I've been working on
for the latest upgrade...

01:18:45.844 --> 01:18:48.472
...to extend Black Box battery life.
- Really?

01:18:48.647 --> 01:18:50.012
It's germs.

01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:51.205
Germs?

01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:53.412
Dip your hands in.

01:18:53.585 --> 01:18:56.315
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ugh, it's warm.

01:18:56.488 --> 01:19:00.720
It collects and magnifies the energy from
the mitochondria in every cell in your body.

01:19:00.892 --> 01:19:02.689
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:19:02.861 --> 01:19:03.885
Hold hands.

01:19:04.062 --> 01:19:05.495
Ew!

01:19:06.331 --> 01:19:08.799
Our combined energy
will get rid of the rock...

01:19:08.967 --> 01:19:11.629
...but we must stand together, as one.

01:19:11.803 --> 01:19:14.533
<i>We know we have disrespected you.</i>

01:19:14.706 --> 01:19:18.904
<i>Leave us now and we shall pick up</i>
<i>the pieces, learning from our mistakes.</i>

01:20:06.691 --> 01:20:10.855
<i>I need a new diaper.</i>

01:20:13.298 --> 01:20:14.959
Over there.

01:20:15.133 --> 01:20:17.101
The rainbow's end.

01:20:17.268 --> 01:20:19.930
Not the end. The beginning.

01:20:20.105 --> 01:20:22.198
For someone else to find.

01:20:22.374 --> 01:20:24.365
Hopefully they'll use it
wiser than we did.

01:20:38.623 --> 01:20:42.650
Mr. Black, we just wanna say both
Team A and Team B will help rebuild.

01:20:42.827 --> 01:20:44.590
But not as separate entities.

01:20:44.963 --> 01:20:47.431
The power is in all of us.

01:20:47.599 --> 01:20:51.000
And if we work together,
we can move mountains.

01:20:51.403 --> 01:20:53.598
Or really big rocks.

01:20:53.772 --> 01:20:55.296
Agreed.

01:20:58.543 --> 01:21:00.909
Sweet muscles.

01:21:13.658 --> 01:21:16.627
That's not what I had in mind.

01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:25.668
Is this your special friend?

01:21:25.837 --> 01:21:27.498
I'm Helvetica.

01:21:27.672 --> 01:21:29.663
Nice to meet you.

01:21:34.212 --> 01:21:36.646
So we're friends.

01:21:37.549 --> 01:21:40.347
Let's settle for no longer enemies.

01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:47.249
<i>So that's pretty much how that week went.</i>

01:21:47.425 --> 01:21:49.859
<i>I made some new friends.</i>

01:21:50.028 --> 01:21:53.486
<i>Loogie and his brothers got</i>
<i>the adventure of their young lives.</i>

01:21:54.799 --> 01:21:57.666
<i>And my parents finally came together.</i>

01:21:58.169 --> 01:22:00.569
<i>For the first time, really.</i>

01:22:01.005 --> 01:22:03.496
<i>Or at least that's how they put it.</i>

01:22:07.278 --> 01:22:10.645
<i>Nose and his dad teamed up</i>
<i>and continued working on experiments...</i>

01:22:10.815 --> 01:22:12.214
<i>... on personal hygiene.</i>

01:22:12.383 --> 01:22:13.577
Which I'm indebted to you for.

01:22:13.751 --> 01:22:18.313
<i>My dad didn't make partner,</i>
<i>but he and Mr. Black became friends.</i>

01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:21.516
<i>Not best friends, but good friends.</i>

01:22:21.693 --> 01:22:24.025
<i>Seeing as how they might</i>
<i>get to be family someday.</i>

01:22:24.195 --> 01:22:25.958
<i>Um, I didn't agree to that.</i>

01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:28.758
<i>Oh, you will. Just wait.</i>

01:22:28.933 --> 01:22:31.367
<i>The Black Box was never perfected.</i>

01:22:31.536 --> 01:22:35.404
<i>In fact, Mr. Black initiated</i>
<i>a top-to-bottom redesign.</i>

01:22:35.573 --> 01:22:38.406
<i>He thought he should do something</i>
<i>to change the world for the better...</i>

01:22:38.576 --> 01:22:41.306
<i>... so he went green.</i>

01:22:41.479 --> 01:22:44.539
<i>But it could never do</i>
<i>what the Rainbow Rock could do.</i>

01:22:44.716 --> 01:22:48.675
<i>And even if it could,</i>
<i>would we really want it?</i>

01:22:48.853 --> 01:22:51.720
<i>Sometimes wishing does make it so.</i>

01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:56.793
<i>But be sure you're wishing for</i>
<i>something worth wishing for.</i>

01:23:00.164 --> 01:23:02.428
I wish we were in a Hollywood movie.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.592
Yeah. Like that's gonna happen.

01:24:09.634 --> 01:24:12.467
I wish I had telekinesis!

01:27:44.649 --> 01:27:49.143
<i>Hey, this song that's playing</i>
<i>right now is something I wrote.</i>

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.345
<i>I got my wish.</i>

01:28:45.276 --> 01:28:47.267
