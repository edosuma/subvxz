00:00.100 --> 00:01.439
Previously on The O.C....

00:01.440 --> 00:03.814
Your mother has a drinking problem. She needs help.

00:03.815 --> 00:05.362
Mom, please, you got to do this.

00:05.363 --> 00:07.556
Who knew my new Playstation idol would be your new girl...

00:07.557 --> 00:08.661
- Your new...
- Friend.

00:08.662 --> 00:10.473
I would love to go to Cabo with you.

00:10.614 --> 00:11.213
Cabo?

00:11.214 --> 00:12.504
I know about you and my dad.

00:12.505 --> 00:16.403
My dad just got out of a marriage, and I don't want him rushing back into another.

00:16.404 --> 00:18.570
Right now, the board is watching you, waiting for you to screw up,

00:18.572 --> 00:20.252
and you're screwing up.

00:20.251 --> 00:23.216
What's it going to be, hospital or Matt?

00:23.213 --> 00:24.679
You and Marissa going to be okay at the house?

00:24.672 --> 00:26.344
Oh, yeah, of course.

00:42.387 --> 00:45.726
He's leaning forward, indicating all focus is on her.

00:45.727 --> 00:47.345
See how her palms are facing up?

00:47.346 --> 00:49.763
That means that she's open to what he's communicating.

00:49.764 --> 00:53.191
Star Magazine-- "What Stars' Body Language is Really Saying."

00:53.222 --> 00:56.459
Well, I've talked to the guy, and what Ryan is really saying

00:56.460 --> 00:58.386
is he and Sadie are just taking it slow.

00:58.387 --> 00:59.799
Oh, no, bodies don't lie.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.417
I'm sounding out a hot new couple alert.

01:02.882 --> 01:04.194
Act like you know nothing.

01:04.394 --> 01:05.434
I don't.

01:05.435 --> 01:07.698
Hey, so, uh, I think we're going to head out.

01:07.699 --> 01:08.571
All right, we'll go with you.

01:08.572 --> 01:10.222
No, no, no, it's fine; just, uh, stay here.

01:10.223 --> 01:11.539
I'll get him home safe.

01:14.394 --> 01:16.515
All right, so they're into each other.

01:17.138 --> 01:19.506
You know what? I'm actually happy for them.

01:19.507 --> 01:21.150
And you don't feel weird about Marissa?

01:21.151 --> 01:23.531
'Cause even I feel a little weird about Marissa for you.

01:23.532 --> 01:26.810
No. I'd feel weird about Marissa if I saw Marissa.

01:27.616 --> 01:28.965
I thought she was staying at your house

01:28.966 --> 01:31.710
now that your parents are hooking up on the high seas.

01:31.711 --> 01:33.747
No, she's been sleeping at the trailer.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.460
This breakup has hit her hard.

01:35.461 --> 01:39.723
She said she needs time to process her feelings and heal in solitude.

01:41.380 --> 01:44.306
Or party with 200 sweaty teens.

01:44.307 --> 01:45.253
What?

01:52.996 --> 01:54.442
Oh, my God.

01:54.443 --> 01:56.690
So, if the body doesn't lie...

01:56.819 --> 01:58.571
Then it's saying "Ew."

01:59.901 --> 02:02.818
"Ew" or "Touch my pooper"?

02:55.917 --> 02:58.412
Coop, it's me, your best friend--

02:58.413 --> 03:00.626
you know, the one that you tell everything to?

03:00.627 --> 03:02.894
Oh, damn, my head.

03:02.895 --> 03:04.276
Oh, what time is it?

03:04.277 --> 03:06.952
I know it's not big in there. My voice travels.

03:08.306 --> 03:09.668
- Um...
- Coop!

03:09.669 --> 03:11.978
- Okay, you got to hide.
- What?

03:12.147 --> 03:14.123
- You live in a trailer.
- Coop!

03:14.752 --> 03:16.126
I'm coming, Sum.

03:16.127 --> 03:19.082
Here, take these and this. Go.

03:19.437 --> 03:22.368
Coop! My hand doesn't remotely hurt.

03:25.048 --> 03:26.099
Coop!

03:26.686 --> 03:28.392
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:28.660 --> 03:30.525
Looking good, Coop.

03:30.568 --> 03:33.228
What very Kate Moss pre-Vanity Fair cover.

03:33.528 --> 03:34.672
What you doing?

03:34.673 --> 03:37.107
Uh, you know, nothing.

03:37.108 --> 03:39.525
Hmm. Did you have a good time last night?

03:39.779 --> 03:40.784
Yeah.

03:41.438 --> 03:44.021
Huh. Synapses are really firing, huh?

03:44.241 --> 03:46.100
I think I have a bit of a head cold.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.093
Well, as long as you don't have any other infectious diseases.

03:49.305 --> 03:50.877
- What?
- Hmm?

03:50.984 --> 03:52.231
Hang on.

03:55.462 --> 03:56.283
Hey.

03:56.284 --> 03:58.404
Hola, Marissa. Es tu madre.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.580
Hi, Mom.

04:00.263 --> 04:01.011
Hello?

04:01.012 --> 04:02.497
Hey, how's my girl?

04:02.498 --> 04:03.580
Hey, Daddy.

04:03.581 --> 04:05.331
So, we're back from our trip.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.585
Did you guys have a good time?

04:06.586 --> 04:08.149
It was wonderful.

04:08.225 --> 04:09.788
Can you have dinner with us tonight?

04:09.789 --> 04:11.276
Um, fine. Uh, what time?

04:11.277 --> 04:12.943
Don't sound so excited.

04:13.041 --> 04:14.378
Uh, eightish.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.096
Yeah, perfect. Bye.

04:16.098 --> 04:17.497
Okay, bye.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.918
- My dad.
- My mom.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.454
- Dinner?
- 8:00.

04:21.856 --> 04:24.194
Why don't you go get dressed, and I'll drive you to school,

04:24.195 --> 04:26.800
and, um, we can talk about that and other stuff?

04:26.801 --> 04:28.486
Okay,  uh, give me a minute.

04:28.487 --> 04:31.525
I think you're going to need a little bit more than that.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.033
Mm, come here. It's cherry.

04:34.034 --> 04:35.386
Look, you got to go.

04:45.625 --> 04:49.327
It's wake-and-bake, baby. Always cures a hangover.

04:52.749 --> 04:54.455
Hey, what's up, man?

04:54.994 --> 04:57.039
Someone's in a chipper mood this morning.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.192
Yeah, well, you know, I had a really good time last night.

04:59.193 --> 05:01.666
I like that place-- the, uh, Bait Shop.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.015
We should hang out there more often.

05:03.016 --> 05:03.835
Really?

05:03.836 --> 05:06.404
Yeah! Uh, maybe, uh, maybe tonight.

05:06.405 --> 05:07.859
You know, Sadie likes the deejay.

05:07.860 --> 05:10.780
She, uh, she kind of wants to get me on the dance floor.

05:10.781 --> 05:11.943
No.

05:11.947 --> 05:15.383
Well, you're-you're the one who's always telling me to loosen up, you know, go out more.

05:15.384 --> 05:18.332
Tense, tightly wound, shut in. That's all I want out of you.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.370
Okay? It's kind of a Boo Radley shape,

05:20.371 --> 05:22.955
far away from the Bait Shop and all its unsavory characters.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.235
Hey, Sandy, what's going on?

05:25.236 --> 05:26.598
Whoa, good mood, huh?

05:26.599 --> 05:28.448
Yeah, well, uh...

05:28.449 --> 05:30.099
Things must be working out with this girl.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.346
Dad, Ryan just smiled.

05:31.347 --> 05:33.367
Well, she seems great.

05:35.847 --> 05:37.061
Everything okay with you?

05:37.062 --> 05:39.335
Yep, just work. Not to worry.

05:39.336 --> 05:43.156
Yeah? Well, uh, listen, fellas, love to chat. Got to get over to Sadie's.

05:43.157 --> 05:46.869
Got a few minutes before school, but, um... cheer up, okay?

05:47.644 --> 05:49.290
Hey, handsome men.

05:49.291 --> 05:50.543
- Where?
- Where?

05:50.569 --> 05:53.397
Aw, I just made the same joke as my dad. That's a bad sign.

05:53.398 --> 05:56.456
Your father happens to be hilarious. It's just harder to tell these days.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.814
Well, then it's a good thing that we have a date tonight.

06:00.321 --> 06:00.997
W hat?

06:00.998 --> 06:02.899
Romantic dinner by the water,

06:02.900 --> 06:06.995
followed by an even more romantic walk on the beach, followed by...

06:06.996 --> 06:10.209
Nothing. Followed by nothing. You will walk and you will eat.

06:10.210 --> 06:13.370
Oh, geez, I'm afraid I... I can't even do that.

06:13.769 --> 06:16.065
- You're canceling?
- Postponing.

06:16.402 --> 06:21.447
I want to be in the right frame of mind to eat... and walk with you. I'm sorry.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.880
Something's wrong?

06:24.241 --> 06:25.808
It'll all be fine.

06:33.073 --> 06:35.564
So, Dad's been working a lot lately, huh?

06:37.493 --> 06:40.771
Look, I'll be your date. We haven't gotten a chance to hang out in a while.

06:40.772 --> 06:43.873
Wow. I thought you forgot you had a mother.

06:43.874 --> 06:48.028
Hey, lay off the guilt. I said I'm in. I just get to pick the movie.

06:48.879 --> 06:51.609
So, we're a couple thousand feet short of a McMansion,

06:51.610 --> 06:53.088
but hopefully someone will take it.

06:53.089 --> 06:55.173
Yeah, well, with that sales pitch, who could resist?

06:55.174 --> 06:57.631
Are you saying you find me irresistible?

07:05.282 --> 07:10.223
Mm, paint smell, Realtor on the way over-- that's romantic and all, but...

07:10.224 --> 07:13.621
Yeah, I guess I should probably get to school, too.

07:15.271 --> 07:16.071
Okay.

07:16.072 --> 07:17.814
- No, no, wait.
- No.

07:17.815 --> 07:19.491
We will pick this up tonight?

07:19.522 --> 07:22.272
Mm, yeah. I'll give you a tour of the pool house.

07:22.271 --> 07:24.296
Yeah, we'll see if you can close the deal.

07:27.623 --> 07:28.729
Got to go.

07:40.391 --> 07:42.363
You didn't mention a word to Ryan?

07:42.364 --> 07:44.949
Spoil his good mood? He practically skipped out of the kitchen.

07:44.950 --> 07:47.902
Atwood skipping? Now, there's a disturbing and odd visual.

07:47.903 --> 07:50.116
Well, picture this one: Ryan dancing.

07:50.117 --> 07:53.159
That's what this woman does to him, and if we want to keep this skip in his step,

07:53.160 --> 07:54.938
we've got to keep Volchok off his radar.

07:54.939 --> 07:57.429
Aw! You play.

07:57.743 --> 08:00.750
Volchok is Atwood's kryptonite. He'll totally Hulk out.

08:00.751 --> 08:04.090
You're mixing comic book metaphors. But you think we can keep Marissa quiet?

08:04.091 --> 08:06.523
Marissa? She can barely put her words together these days.

08:06.524 --> 08:08.152
She's usually such a wordsmith.

08:08.153 --> 08:11.326
What does she see in that guy? He's so dirty and greasy.

08:11.327 --> 08:13.003
He's got good abs.

08:13.004 --> 08:14.516
Women like abs.

08:14.517 --> 08:16.687
Got a six-pack myself; I know.

08:16.935 --> 08:19.217
Oh, Cohen, those are your ribs.

08:19.381 --> 08:23.207
Oh. Well, listen, let's just not tell anybody anything.

08:23.827 --> 08:27.202
All right, heads down, lips sealed, smooth sailing.

08:27.239 --> 08:30.197
He's also got really defined triceps. I like that.

08:41.573 --> 08:43.236
Well, I'm going to get right to it.

08:44.046 --> 08:45.461
I talked to Griffin.

08:46.739 --> 08:48.035
You're firing me?

08:48.036 --> 08:50.869
Yes... I'm firing you.

08:50.870 --> 08:52.212
I have no choice.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.617
It's for the good of the hospital.

08:55.918 --> 08:58.075
What kind of garbage excuse is that?

08:58.076 --> 08:59.316
The truthful kind.

08:59.317 --> 09:01.492
Yeah, when it's convenient for you.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.974
You know, every time that you need to do something that makes you feel bad,

09:05.975 --> 09:07.275
you're doing it for the hospital.

09:07.276 --> 09:10.016
It's either you... or the hospital.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.710
Griffin will not move forward unless you're gone.

09:12.777 --> 09:14.354
You don't even see what's happening.

09:14.592 --> 09:16.012
He's making me the fall guy.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.813
There's no need to peddle in conspiracy theories here, Matt.

09:18.814 --> 09:20.407
You are no angel.

09:20.408 --> 09:21.552
Neither is Griffin.

09:21.553 --> 09:24.650
He's  been taking kickbacks from vendors for years.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.921
I like to know who I'm getting into business with.

09:26.922 --> 09:28.406
Those are some bold accusations.

09:28.407 --> 09:32.111
I can back them up, and I'll be happy to share everything I know about him...

09:32.964 --> 09:35.706
and you to whoever will listen.

09:38.123 --> 09:39.549
Thanks for the heads-up.

09:41.037 --> 09:42.743
Now I know I'm doing the right thing.

09:42.744 --> 09:44.420
You think things have been complicated?

09:44.421 --> 09:46.849
You haven't seen anything yet... boss.

09:57.802 --> 09:59.099
Whoa-oh!

10:01.093 --> 10:03.474
A little champagne won't hurt you girls.

10:03.475 --> 10:04.806
It is a toast.

10:04.807 --> 10:06.574
How often do we get engaged?

10:06.730 --> 10:08.067
Don't answer that.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.094
Engaged?

10:11.095 --> 10:12.456
You guys are engaged?

10:12.457 --> 10:14.306
I'm so happy for you.

10:14.307 --> 10:15.592
Thank you, baby.

10:15.593 --> 10:17.041
- Really? You are?
- Yeah.

10:17.042 --> 10:21.318
I mean, you may be Mrs. Cooper-Nichol-Cooper-Roberts, but if you make my dad happy...

10:21.319 --> 10:22.818
- She does.
- I do.

10:22.819 --> 10:24.023
Then I'm happy.

10:25.964 --> 10:27.808
Marissa, how about some champagne?

10:28.820 --> 10:29.887
Sure.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.284
Marissa, do you have anything to add?

10:33.411 --> 10:35.334
Oh. One sec.

10:36.366 --> 10:37.451
Hey.

10:38.016 --> 10:39.200
Yeah.

10:40.269 --> 10:41.572
You are?

10:41.971 --> 10:43.224
Okay, bye.

10:53.697 --> 10:55.049
Congrats.

10:58.927 --> 11:00.986
Will you excuse me for a moment?

11:04.113 --> 11:05.020
I 'm...

11:05.921 --> 11:07.152
Marissa!

11:08.008 --> 11:09.716
Where do you think you're going, young lady?

11:09.717 --> 11:12.590
I got to go, Mom. My friend called, and he says he needs me.

11:12.591 --> 11:14.011
I need you.

11:14.028 --> 11:16.785
I don't have to tell you how important this night is for our family.

11:16.786 --> 11:19.906
Yeah, well, don't worry, Mom. I'm not going to screw up your golden ticket.

11:55.737 --> 11:58.492
I don't know if I'm a fan of Yakuza films.

11:59.101 --> 12:02.144
It was an interesting movie, but a fun night.

12:02.145 --> 12:06.414
Yeah. I would say anytime you get to watch a guy rip off his own arm to continue fighting,

12:06.415 --> 12:07.515
that's a really good night.

12:07.516 --> 12:09.244
I just didn't understand the other fellow.

12:09.245 --> 12:11.787
What, the guy that produced the ball of energy from his chest

12:11.788 --> 12:12.810
and then destroyed the world?

12:12.811 --> 12:15.675
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

12:16.175 --> 12:18.333
You remember when I took you to Fantasia?

12:19.574 --> 12:20.920
'Cause I do.

12:22.174 --> 12:23.699
I'm sorry you didn't like the movie.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.970
Ah, it was worth it to spend some time with you.

12:27.544 --> 12:28.730
I missed you.

12:29.204 --> 12:31.480
Well, do you want to do it again? Do you want a second date?

12:31.608 --> 12:33.994
Yeah, but I get to pick the activity.

12:33.995 --> 12:34.825
Sure.

12:34.826 --> 12:35.899
Tomorrow night?

12:35.910 --> 12:37.473
I have an idea already.

12:39.363 --> 12:41.376
- Hey.
- We have a major problem.

12:41.377 --> 12:45.605
Marissa just bailed on our parents' engagement party to skank out with the surf Nazi.

12:45.606 --> 12:47.939
Your dad and Julie got engaged?

12:47.940 --> 12:50.472
You kind of buried the lead there, Summer.

12:50.476 --> 12:53.013
- Julie and Dr. Roberts?
- We've got bigger fish here, Cohen.

12:53.014 --> 12:55.529
Marissa is on a slut spiral, and we need to stop her.

12:55.530 --> 12:56.838
That's a little out of my league.

12:56.839 --> 12:58.244
I know; we need Ryan.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.792
The code of silence has been lifted.

12:59.793 --> 13:01.302
I'll talk to him...

13:02.001 --> 13:04.447
but he's been in such a good mood.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.886
So this is the pool house?

13:14.439 --> 13:16.309
Interested in making an offer?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.528
Uh, it's a little small,

13:19.688 --> 13:21.162
but it's got great views.

13:25.297 --> 13:27.780
What? Locked?

13:28.179 --> 13:30.274
When did this door get a lock on it?

13:31.284 --> 13:33.764
- Little busy, Seth.
- Yeah, you're not the only one.

13:33.765 --> 13:35.755
Listen, I didn't want to have to tell you this through the door,

13:35.756 --> 13:38.373
but Marissa's been hooking up with Volchok.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.660
Oh,  hey.

13:42.557 --> 13:44.225
Oh. Hey.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.986
Sadie, I didn't realize...

13:46.987 --> 13:48.876
Yeah. Good night, Seth.

13:48.877 --> 13:49.662
Night.

13:49.663 --> 13:50.493
Call me, okay?

13:50.494 --> 13:51.455
Yeah.

13:57.868 --> 13:59.640
I guess I ruined the mood, huh?

13:59.641 --> 14:00.849
Just a lot.

14:06.548 --> 14:09.156
You know, when I put the locks on, I thought I solved the problem.

14:09.157 --> 14:11.937
Well, you know me. When I have important information to disseminate,

14:11.938 --> 14:15.113
nothing can stop me, not walls, not locks...

14:15.114 --> 14:16.193
Not women.

14:16.452 --> 14:17.764
So what are you going to do?

14:17.765 --> 14:20.678
Reschedule with Sadie, and go back to her place.

14:20.679 --> 14:22.329
No, I meant about Marissa.

14:22.330 --> 14:24.051
What do you mean, what am I going to do?

14:24.239 --> 14:29.233
Well, Summer seems to think this Volchok guy is not exactly a beacon of morality.

14:29.234 --> 14:30.961
Eh, not my problem, not my girlfriend.

14:30.962 --> 14:33.420
Well, I know. 
Uh, two coffees.

14:33.421 --> 14:35.588
Look, man, she makes her own choices; so do I.

14:35.724 --> 14:37.507
I choose Sadie's tonight.

14:37.508 --> 14:41.703
So Zen these days. It's simultaneously inspiring and disconcerting.

14:41.704 --> 14:43.786
Ah, just feeling good, man, just feeling good.

14:44.705 --> 14:45.653
Cheers.

14:46.070 --> 14:49.006
I can't believe you're getting married... again.

14:49.007 --> 14:50.904
You make it seem like an everyday occurrence.

14:50.905 --> 14:52.203
It almost is.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.483
This time, it's going to stick. It just feels real.

14:55.484 --> 14:58.965
Not everyone can have that Kirsten and Sandy relationship,

14:58.966 --> 15:03.609
that bionic, Kevlar-wrapped robo-marriage that can withstand anything you throw at it.

15:05.325 --> 15:08.267
Well, you've seemed happier than I've seen you in a long time.

15:08.769 --> 15:11.170
Mm. Neil has mellowed me.

15:11.284 --> 15:15.066
No more manipulative bitch, no more scheming, no more double-crossing,

15:15.067 --> 15:17.173
which will be a disappointment to some.

15:17.174 --> 15:18.725
Not for Dr. Roberts.

15:19.284 --> 15:22.361
You know, we both just kind of found each other

15:22.383 --> 15:24.943
right at the moment when we really needed someone.

15:24.979 --> 15:26.326
There's no agenda.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.696
He does have a palatial estate.

15:28.697 --> 15:32.890
Kirsten... if he wanted to live together in this trailer, I'd do it.

15:33.826 --> 15:35.214
Not that I'm offering.

15:37.734 --> 15:39.271
Real classy, Gus.

15:39.737 --> 15:42.238
It's them Big Gulps. They go right through me.

15:42.239 --> 15:43.810
Sneak up on me, too.

15:43.811 --> 15:45.464
That's a nice final image.

15:45.465 --> 15:46.763
What's going on?

15:47.815 --> 15:49.049
Oh, my God.

15:50.091 --> 15:51.643
You the new tenant?

15:51.941 --> 15:53.347
Nice to meet you.

15:54.082 --> 15:55.975
We really need to get you out of here.

16:18.659 --> 16:19.664
Hi.

16:20.051 --> 16:21.720
Hi. What's up?

16:21.839 --> 16:23.200
Missed you in class.

16:24.085 --> 16:25.719
Yeah, there was traffic.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.086
We had that test today.

16:28.035 --> 16:29.396
That was today?

16:39.500 --> 16:40.530
Thanks.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.041
Got to go.

16:45.757 --> 16:47.793
Totally and completely untrue,

16:47.794 --> 16:51.010
and if Matt ever tried to print that, I will sue him for libel.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.637
He seemed pretty sure of himself.

16:52.638 --> 16:55.622
If it wasn't for me, your firm would be belly-up right now,

16:55.623 --> 16:58.947
which is why I don't appreciate your accusing me.

16:59.062 --> 17:01.145
I'm not accusing anybody of anything.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.070
Forgive me for saying, Henry, but...

17:03.268 --> 17:05.089
you seem a touch defensive.

17:08.884 --> 17:12.419
The only business that I am in is the business of helping people.

17:12.420 --> 17:15.419
I would like to believe that we are partners in that.

17:18.987 --> 17:20.537
You give me your word,

17:20.799 --> 17:22.586
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

17:22.587 --> 17:26.839
Sandy, I didn't become a doctor to get rich.

17:27.674 --> 17:29.076
You have my word.

17:34.264 --> 17:37.416
Thank you. You did a wonderful job.

17:37.611 --> 17:38.668
Thank you.

17:40.095 --> 17:41.222
Bye.

17:57.090 --> 17:58.744
Hola, Mima.

17:59.837 --> 18:01.275
Es bueno.

18:03.259 --> 18:05.426
Vamanos,  por favor.

18:05.598 --> 18:07.868
I'm from the Philippines.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.760
Oh, well, then...

18:24.081 --> 18:26.969
Wow, Coop. You make a really good hood ornament.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.449
- Funny.
- I know.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.037
Oh, you're getting drunk.

18:32.038 --> 18:33.524
More like staying drunk.

18:33.525 --> 18:34.933
Oh, good plan.

18:34.934 --> 18:36.206
I can't deal with this right now.

18:36.207 --> 18:39.403
Well, you're going to have to, 'cause now, Coop, we're sisters.

18:39.404 --> 18:41.452
Right, which means, you're not my mom.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.083
I know about Volchok. I saw you mauling him at the Bait Shop.

18:45.084 --> 18:47.486
I know you're shacking up with him at the trailer park.

18:47.487 --> 18:50.983
Wow. Well, aren't you a regular Veronica Mars?

18:50.984 --> 18:52.753
Way to solve this week's mystery.

18:52.754 --> 18:54.106
What has gotten into you?

18:54.107 --> 18:55.305
Since I know who has.

18:55.306 --> 18:56.211
What do you care?

18:56.212 --> 18:59.830
You have Seth and Ryan's got his new girlfriend. Johnny's gone.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.194
What difference does it make what I do?

19:03.195 --> 19:04.431
I'm not hurting anyone.

19:04.432 --> 19:07.797
Oh. You're just the saddest girl in the whole world.

19:07.798 --> 19:11.250
Grow up. Get over yourself. Take a shower.

19:11.346 --> 19:14.653
Fine. Why don't you take your little emo boyfriend, drive off in your Beamer,

19:14.654 --> 19:15.891
and go home to Daddy's mansion?

19:15.892 --> 19:18.819
Oh, yeah, why don't you go with Volchok to one of his heavy metal vomit parties,

19:18.820 --> 19:21.506
and, like, listen to heavy metal and, like, vomit?!

19:21.507 --> 19:23.346
Wow. You're being so lame.

19:23.347 --> 19:24.357
Not as lame as you.

19:24.358 --> 19:25.717
Fine. Bye.

19:25.718 --> 19:26.746
Later.

19:52.587 --> 19:53.922
What are you doing?

19:53.923 --> 19:54.915
Taking what's mine.

19:54.916 --> 19:57.644
You were supposed to turn over your key. You're trespassing.

19:57.645 --> 20:01.451
These are my personal files, which your office conveniently forgot to send.

20:01.452 --> 20:02.256
I'm taking them.

20:02.257 --> 20:03.092
No, you're not.

20:03.093 --> 20:04.834
What are you gonna do? Arrest me, Sandy?

20:04.835 --> 20:06.112
You gonna fight me?

20:06.131 --> 20:07.832
You're acting like you got something to hide.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.173
You're acting like a child.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.009
If you're so sure that I don't have a case,

20:11.010 --> 20:13.161
then you shouldn't care if I leave with this box.

20:13.162 --> 20:14.185
Are you threatening me?

20:14.186 --> 20:15.825
Doesn't seem like I have a choice.

20:15.956 --> 20:17.212
Game on, Sandy.

20:22.991 --> 20:26.720
Wow, this is so romantic... and original.

20:26.721 --> 20:29.918
Yeah, well, what can I say? Creature of habit.

20:29.919 --> 20:32.755
Yes, yes, the lure of the chili fry.

20:33.578 --> 20:35.391
A natural aphrodisiac.

20:35.392 --> 20:38.570
Yeah, well, I think we'll be fine as long as Seth is nowhere nearby.

20:39.282 --> 20:40.944
Seth, right.

20:41.663 --> 20:45.223
Well, good, good, 'cause I have something to tell you. I have some good news.

20:45.224 --> 20:46.324
Yeah?

20:46.325 --> 20:49.003
...believe Volchok... he's gonna be pissed.

20:49.004 --> 20:52.848
Nah, he won't care, he's hanging with that private school chick, Marissa.

20:52.962 --> 20:55.298
- She seems kinda lame.
- Yeah, lame and hot.

20:55.299 --> 20:58.395
She isn't innocent. Volchok show you the scratches on his back?

21:01.266 --> 21:03.136
- Why don't we take this to go?
- No, no, it's fine.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.690
- Let's just go, come on.
- Sadie, it's fine-- Sadie.

21:08.650 --> 21:09.801
Sadie.

21:10.082 --> 21:11.145
Sadie!

21:15.584 --> 21:16.772
I'm not mad.

21:16.773 --> 21:20.100
I just feel like, once again, you know, the mood was kind of ruined.

21:20.101 --> 21:22.089
All right, well, okay, we can turn it around.

21:22.090 --> 21:23.896
I think we're trying too hard.

21:24.647 --> 21:28.410
Maybe we need to let the perfect night just happen. Okay?

21:28.411 --> 21:29.901
Give it some time.

21:29.931 --> 21:31.602
All right, fine.

21:33.968 --> 21:36.350
Let me at least drive you home.

21:36.745 --> 21:37.876
Okay.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.198
Just give me a second.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.724
Ryan, come on. Don't go back.

21:45.414 --> 21:47.207
Hey, look, it's little bitch.

21:47.208 --> 21:48.388
Volchok around?

21:48.389 --> 21:49.530
Why? You looking for your girlfriend?

21:49.531 --> 21:50.911
No, actually I'm looking for him.

21:50.912 --> 21:54.790
And if you see him, tell him that, and to meet me under the pier tomorrow morning.

21:56.951 --> 21:59.301
You think you can remember all that?

22:00.889 --> 22:03.207
You need me to write it down for you?

22:05.728 --> 22:08.307
Yeah, bro, we'll tell him.

22:29.219 --> 22:30.858
You know, I just knew.

22:31.092 --> 22:34.167
I knew it was only a matter of time until you got in my face again.

22:34.168 --> 22:35.055
Just want to talk.

22:35.056 --> 22:37.001
About what? Your new girlfriend or mine?

22:37.002 --> 22:38.721
'Cause, you know, I got stories about both of them.

22:38.722 --> 22:40.083
Bet you do.

22:40.397 --> 22:43.905
This where you tell me I better leave her alone, that she's too good for me.

22:43.906 --> 22:48.388
Whoever Marissa wants to be with, it's not my place to judge.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.202
Saw her at school, she didn't look so good.

22:52.203 --> 22:54.074
Well, that girl couldn't look bad if she tried.

22:54.075 --> 22:56.096
She was drinking; you know she has a problem with that, right?

22:56.097 --> 22:59.391
She drinks, she gets drunk. I don't see the problem.

23:00.083 --> 23:02.989
Just so you know, I'm not looking after her anymore.

23:04.354 --> 23:05.745
It's on you now.

23:09.712 --> 23:12.916
Treat her right. She deserves it.

23:56.448 --> 23:58.064
Good morning, ladies.

23:58.065 --> 23:59.627
I'd say a great morning.

23:59.628 --> 24:02.302
We're a new family. First breakfast together.

24:02.463 --> 24:05.568
And tonight, we're going to have our first family dinner--

24:05.569 --> 24:08.594
something that hopefully will become a weekly tradition.

24:08.595 --> 24:11.140
Nothing like all sitting down together to a good meal.

24:11.141 --> 24:13.586
Discussing current events, catching up on each other's lives--

24:13.587 --> 24:14.580
doesn't that sound fun?

24:14.581 --> 24:18.895
Tons of. I know Marissa has several events that she would love to share with the family.

24:18.896 --> 24:21.173
Summer, maybe you can make that pineapple dessert I like,

24:21.174 --> 24:22.998
the one with the graham cracker things.

24:22.999 --> 24:25.489
Oh, I'm sure Daddy's little girl would love to.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.213
Excuse me.

24:32.339 --> 24:33.623
Sisters.

24:37.410 --> 24:38.653
Sadie!

24:41.650 --> 24:43.175
Hey, man, I was looking for Sadie.

24:43.176 --> 24:44.726
Hey. Yeah, she's in the shower.

24:45.010 --> 24:46.290
Or was.

24:46.805 --> 24:48.531
Ryan, did you meet Bob?

24:49.202 --> 24:51.829
Hey, Bob. What's up?

24:53.430 --> 24:55.802
- Garage door sticks a little.
- Cool.

24:55.803 --> 24:57.460
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

24:57.784 --> 24:58.816
Yeah.

25:04.416 --> 25:07.188
One bad date and I'm already replaced, huh?

25:07.189 --> 25:08.660
All right, two bad dates.

25:08.661 --> 25:09.786
Bob?

25:10.161 --> 25:11.518
He just bought the house.

25:11.519 --> 25:13.977
He lives next door, and he made a really great offer.

25:15.159 --> 25:17.277
That was my news last night, if you would have listened.

25:17.278 --> 25:19.591
I know, I'm sorry. I was distracted.

25:20.473 --> 25:23.214
- You want to tell me what's up?
- Sure, um...

25:24.244 --> 25:27.986
It's Volchok and Marissa. But it's all good now.

25:27.987 --> 25:31.486
There was a conversation I needed to have, I had it, I'm done.

25:31.487 --> 25:35.064
That's good. It's just, I think I'm done, too.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.391
What do you mean?

25:36.392 --> 25:39.552
Well, my aunt's business is handled. The house is sold.

25:40.063 --> 25:42.162
There's kind of no reason for me to be here.

25:42.519 --> 25:43.435
There's no reason?

25:43.436 --> 25:45.850
Ryan, I never intended to stay this long.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.626
I was thinking it might be easier for me to leave, if...

25:48.627 --> 25:50.321
If we didn't happen.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.505
Have you thought about this?

25:56.506 --> 25:59.382
Yeah, I have. Have you?

26:00.872 --> 26:01.716
Yeah.

26:01.717 --> 26:05.768
I mean, if I stayed, I'd have to find an apartment, and then what?

26:05.872 --> 26:08.071
Wait for you to finish high school, follow you to college?

26:08.072 --> 26:09.703
We're getting a little ahead of ourselves.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.853
I honestly didn't think that much about the future. I, uh...

26:17.409 --> 26:20.106
I was just hoping to take you to dinner.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.492
You eat, right?

26:34.691 --> 26:37.854
You haven't thought about it, because you're not ready to think about it,

26:37.855 --> 26:39.603
which I totally get.

26:40.906 --> 26:45.220
But I can't change my whole life to be with someone who's distracted.

26:56.008 --> 26:57.184
So that's it then.

26:57.185 --> 27:00.085
No more smiling, no skipping, no more dancing.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.673
You were never a fan of the dancing.

27:01.674 --> 27:04.024
I don't know; might have come around. Now we'll never know.

27:04.025 --> 27:07.288
Yeah, I can't just ask her to move here, change her whole life.

27:07.289 --> 27:10.321
Well, relocating to Newport might not be that big a deal.

27:10.322 --> 27:13.351
Put a lot of pressure on us, you know, on the relationship.

27:13.352 --> 27:14.948
Ryan Atwood loves pressure.

27:14.949 --> 27:18.960
He's not comfortable unless his entire body is being squeezed in a vice grip.

27:18.961 --> 27:20.246
That is not true.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.724
Yeah? You moved to Chino to help a girl pregnant

27:22.725 --> 27:24.726
with a baby that might not even be yours.

27:24.727 --> 27:25.671
Theresa needed someone.

27:25.672 --> 27:29.114
Stayed with Marissa for several years of tortured torture.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.577
She was there for me, too.

27:30.578 --> 27:32.921
But when it comes to pursuing your own happiness

27:32.922 --> 27:36.242
with a great girl who seems to be relatively issue-free...

27:38.137 --> 27:39.526
I got to ask her to stay.

27:39.527 --> 27:40.761
Yes, you do.

27:41.317 --> 27:42.462
All right.

27:42.571 --> 27:45.443
I saw that smile. Smiler.

27:50.386 --> 27:54.218
I told you, Sandy, the kid's just posturing. He's trying to get a rise out of you.

27:54.219 --> 27:56.310
Well, Matt said he has documents.

27:56.532 --> 27:58.553
He said he could prove what he's saying.

27:59.423 --> 28:02.937
Look, Sandy, I apologize.

28:04.831 --> 28:05.944
Now, what are you saying?

28:05.945 --> 28:10.784
I'm saying, I've already let you shoulder too much of the responsibility on this situation.

28:10.785 --> 28:12.467
Now I'll handle it from here.

28:12.468 --> 28:14.320
Well, that sounds a little ominous.

28:14.407 --> 28:15.393
What are you going to do?

28:15.394 --> 28:17.098
You focus on the hospital.

28:17.099 --> 28:20.538
There's a lot of people counting on you, and there's a lot of work to be done.

28:20.539 --> 28:22.248
You've done too much already.

28:22.249 --> 28:25.631
What was that you were saying about 18 holes at Big Canyon?

28:39.471 --> 28:41.162
You're wearing that to a family dinner?

28:41.163 --> 28:42.788
Who says I'm going to dinner?

28:43.410 --> 28:48.363
Okay, Marissa, be mad at me if you want, but it is our family.

28:49.283 --> 28:51.664
Whatever. Save me some dessert.

29:00.277 --> 29:01.350
Hey, what's up?

29:01.351 --> 29:04.273
The slut is still spiraling. I thought I told you to talk to Ryan.

29:04.274 --> 29:08.756
I did; I tried to activate his savior complex, but it seems he's been cured.

29:08.757 --> 29:10.500
Hey, I got to go; I'm hanging with my mom.

29:10.501 --> 29:11.623
You're hanging with your mom?

29:11.624 --> 29:14.176
I know, it seems a little weird. But we thought we'd try something different.

29:14.177 --> 29:15.589
So I'll talk to you later.

29:15.590 --> 29:16.481
Fine.

29:16.482 --> 29:17.513
Okay, bye.

29:18.719 --> 29:19.778
All set?

29:19.779 --> 29:23.094
Yeah. Where we going? Cardio bar? New Pilates?

29:23.095 --> 29:24.226
Something new.

29:34.342 --> 29:36.895
Let's give Marissa a few more minutes, shall we?

29:37.510 --> 29:39.633
Actually, I think we should just get started.

29:39.634 --> 29:43.103
Personally, I'm starving. Why don't we just dig in and bond?

29:43.104 --> 29:46.300
What were we gonna do at this dinner? Discuss current events?

29:46.301 --> 29:48.727
I think we live in a very fascinating time.

29:48.728 --> 29:49.616
Riveting.

29:49.617 --> 29:51.905
Julie, why don't you ring her on her cell, see where she is?

29:51.906 --> 29:53.892
I did call, several times.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.510
Well, I'm just a little concerned, you know.

29:55.511 --> 29:58.090
She never missed dinner when she was staying here last semester.

29:58.091 --> 29:59.911
That's because I wasn't here.

30:03.913 --> 30:05.720
Neil, Marissa and I haven't always had the greatest...

30:05.721 --> 30:07.083
Luck.

30:07.530 --> 30:12.376
But you've always stood by each other through hard times.

30:12.761 --> 30:14.369
Isn't that great, Dad?

30:14.551 --> 30:16.369
Yes, it is.

30:16.592 --> 30:18.847
You Cooper girls are really something.

30:19.174 --> 30:20.507
Thank you, Neil.

30:21.184 --> 30:23.896
And thank you, Summer.

30:25.348 --> 30:27.002
Will you pass the potatoes, please?

30:37.690 --> 30:40.039
Thought you and your mom fought all the time.

30:41.399 --> 30:42.819
It's not my mom.

30:43.602 --> 30:44.863
It's Summer.

30:46.125 --> 30:49.411
You know, the only other time we really fought was in the fifth grade,

30:49.606 --> 30:53.634
when I sat in the back of the bus with Luke on the way to the Museum of Tolerance.

30:54.868 --> 30:56.151
Who's Luke?

30:57.183 --> 30:59.552
Summer and Luke were engaged...

30:59.731 --> 31:01.364
in the second grade.

31:01.365 --> 31:03.134
She doesn't like to talk about it.

31:05.950 --> 31:08.558
Why all the questions all of a sudden?

31:08.559 --> 31:09.845
What do you mean?

31:10.723 --> 31:13.437
You just seem very interested in my life.

31:14.464 --> 31:16.082
I just, um...

31:16.704 --> 31:19.283
We're hanging out. Seems like...

31:19.850 --> 31:20.987
What?

31:21.587 --> 31:25.499
Um... you deserve to be treated right.

31:27.738 --> 31:30.570
If I wanted to be treated right, I wouldn't be with you.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.782
Works for me.

31:43.091 --> 31:44.443
You want to bump?

31:45.690 --> 31:50.065
I don't... I mean... I've never.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.083
There's a first time for everything.

31:55.324 --> 31:57.271
Guess I'm partying solo.

32:02.122 --> 32:03.938
Okay, what is this place?

32:04.247 --> 32:05.382
You'll see.

32:10.505 --> 32:13.412
Crappy rec center basement, bad coffee?

32:13.413 --> 32:14.861
I don't think you're into Weight Watchers,

32:14.862 --> 32:17.226
so either you're the lead in a community theater group

32:17.227 --> 32:19.976
or have converted to an extremely underfunded religion.

32:19.977 --> 32:23.681
Hi, I'm Ellen. And I'm an alcoholic.

32:23.682 --> 32:25.513
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hi, Ellen.

32:25.514 --> 32:28.179
We will begin this evening with our reading of chapter five.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.460
Seth.

32:31.302 --> 32:33.641
I thought if you knew, you wouldn't have come.

32:33.642 --> 32:35.210
Well, good instinct.

32:35.211 --> 32:37.712
Like going through this the first time wasn't painful enough.

32:37.713 --> 32:42.048
This place has saved my family, my marriage, quite possibly my life.

32:42.049 --> 32:44.357
These people know more about me than my own family.

32:44.358 --> 32:45.323
Well, whose fault is that?

32:45.324 --> 32:47.045
It's not like you ever talk about what happened.

32:47.046 --> 32:49.340
It's not like you ever ask.

32:49.341 --> 32:51.283
And if this is how you act when I share it with you...

32:51.284 --> 32:53.473
There's sharing and then there's lying.

32:53.642 --> 32:55.937
Well, we're here, and I'm not leaving.

32:55.938 --> 32:59.052
So you can wait in the car, or you can do this for me.

32:59.993 --> 33:01.570
Just give me an hour.

33:02.318 --> 33:04.727
It's important that you be here tonight.

33:06.568 --> 33:09.121
Is anyone gonna rip off their own arm and keep fighting?

33:09.122 --> 33:11.189
Metaphorically speaking, yeah.

33:25.142 --> 33:28.137
Matt, this is Mitchell Kiven from the Register.

33:28.138 --> 33:31.547
I got your message, and I'm extremely interested in talking about the Griffin story.

33:31.548 --> 33:32.896
You've got the number.

33:33.774 --> 33:36.617
Hey, Matt, it's Sandy. We need to talk.

33:36.618 --> 33:38.802
Will you call me back as soon as you can?

33:50.780 --> 33:53.043
Look, it's cool, you guys take whatever you want. I don't care.

33:53.044 --> 33:54.644
This isn't a robbery.

34:14.702 --> 34:16.197
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.408
Is, uh, Sadie around?

34:18.409 --> 34:19.971
Uh, no, actually, she, uh...

34:19.972 --> 34:21.279
Do you mind if I come in and wait?

34:21.364 --> 34:23.068
Well, I mean, it might be awhile.

34:23.069 --> 34:24.536
You just missed her.

34:25.121 --> 34:27.275
She left for Oregon a couple hours ago.

34:29.077 --> 34:30.330
I'm sorry.

34:58.964 --> 35:00.159
Hey.

35:01.789 --> 35:02.821
Hi.

35:04.896 --> 35:06.266
What are you doing here?

35:06.267 --> 35:10.026
Sorry, I figured you were spending your time under the pier these days.

35:11.049 --> 35:13.911
Uh... I can go.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.317
No, it's fine, I'm... I'm not going to stay.

35:18.147 --> 35:19.306
Where's Sadie?

35:19.987 --> 35:22.838
Gone. Back to Oregon.

35:24.117 --> 35:26.347
Went over to see her, she'd already left.

35:26.399 --> 35:27.773
Without saying good-bye?

35:27.774 --> 35:29.908
Guess she thought it was easier this way.

35:31.005 --> 35:32.326
And is it?

35:35.527 --> 35:38.229
You know, you don't have to answer that. I'm gonna go.

35:38.369 --> 35:39.649
But, um...

35:40.504 --> 35:42.189
Enjoy, then.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.628
I'll leave it as I found it.

35:55.301 --> 36:00.068
I'd pissed in the streets, eaten out of garbage,

36:00.069 --> 36:03.192
and accidentally shot my wife--

36:03.193 --> 36:06.533
not once, but twice.

36:06.824 --> 36:08.556
Thank you very much.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.363
That's a heartwarming tale.

36:11.034 --> 36:13.304
He's been sober 30 years.

36:14.962 --> 36:16.675
Thank you for that, George.

36:16.676 --> 36:19.285
Before we leave, we have a couple of chips to hand out.

36:19.286 --> 36:21.596
Kirsten, if you'd like to join me.

36:26.013 --> 36:27.505
Congratulations.

36:28.993 --> 36:30.434
You're nine months sober.

36:30.435 --> 36:31.796
Oh, thank you.

36:31.837 --> 36:33.137
All of you.

36:33.338 --> 36:38.001
And, uh... especially my son, Seth, who's here with me tonight.

36:38.361 --> 36:39.798
Hi, Seth.

36:39.799 --> 36:40.859
Hey.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.066
He doesn't know this, but...

36:43.486 --> 36:46.058
he's the reason that I got sober.

36:49.300 --> 36:52.460
The look on his face at my Intervention...

36:52.825 --> 36:55.333
He was so disappointed in me.

36:58.714 --> 37:01.258
But he believed that I could do this...

37:01.747 --> 37:03.437
and he was right.

37:13.108 --> 37:15.139
Congratulations, Mom.

37:17.945 --> 37:20.205
Only 29 years and three months more to go

37:20.206 --> 37:23.336
until you're as normal as William S. Burroughs over there.

37:32.585 --> 37:34.223
Never expected to see you here.

37:34.224 --> 37:36.515
Yeah, well, I'm just glad I found you.

37:36.516 --> 37:40.629
Apparently, there's a lot of ways to leave Newport-- bus, plane, boat.

37:40.630 --> 37:41.879
Greyhound.

37:42.176 --> 37:43.676
Way to hedge your bets.

37:43.677 --> 37:45.605
I'm just glad you're still here.

37:46.930 --> 37:48.027
Why?

37:48.028 --> 37:50.450
Because I don't think you should leave.

37:51.218 --> 37:53.259
Ryan really cares about you.

37:56.461 --> 37:57.927
He told you that?

37:58.098 --> 37:59.832
Well, I mean, he didn't have to.

37:59.833 --> 38:02.938
After everything we've been through, I think I know him pretty well.

38:06.239 --> 38:08.302
Yeah, well, this is my bus.

38:08.303 --> 38:09.474
He wants you to stay.

38:09.475 --> 38:10.787
He didn't try to stop me.

38:10.788 --> 38:14.119
Yeah, he did, he was just a couple minutes too late.

38:15.807 --> 38:17.599
Why are you doing this?

38:19.101 --> 38:22.361
Well, I guess because you make Ryan happy.

38:35.422 --> 38:37.201
Neil, dinner was amazing.

38:37.202 --> 38:40.285
Yeah, Marissa's going to be sorry she missed it.

38:41.017 --> 38:44.047
Well, we have years of family dinners ahead of us.

38:44.884 --> 38:48.158
Julie, you know this engagement is a trial, right?

38:48.159 --> 38:49.398
What?

38:49.567 --> 38:50.811
Trial.

38:51.457 --> 38:53.512
For you, me.

38:54.020 --> 38:55.343
Us together.

38:55.344 --> 38:56.778
For the girls.

38:57.434 --> 39:01.923
I mean, if our families aren't a good fit, then we really... shouldn't get married.

39:04.730 --> 39:09.660
Of course. I mean... love doesn't really conquer all.

39:09.661 --> 39:12.363
And we both have the broken marriages to prove that.

39:12.468 --> 39:14.029
But, Neil, surely this time...

39:14.030 --> 39:17.879
Sweetheart, I don't mean that in a punitive way, I'm just trying to be practical.

39:21.257 --> 39:22.924
I've got some reading to do.

39:23.526 --> 39:24.995
I'll see you in minute.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.643
- Hey, baby.
- Oop!

39:30.725 --> 39:32.176
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

39:35.722 --> 39:39.920
I couldn't help overhearing... what my dad just said.

39:39.921 --> 39:43.775
But don't worry, cause he always gets this way as soon as he starts to get close to someone.

39:45.744 --> 39:50.552
Actually, Summer, the only thing I'm worried about is my daughter.

39:52.559 --> 39:54.312
Yeah, me, too.

40:07.189 --> 40:08.932
Hey, vodka on the rocks, please.

40:08.933 --> 40:10.357
You got ID?

40:10.773 --> 40:12.328
Look, I drink here all the time.

40:12.329 --> 40:14.852
Yeah, when Volchok's guys are buying.

40:15.634 --> 40:18.012
Can't you just make an exception this one time?

40:18.013 --> 40:19.447
I used to date the manager.

40:19.448 --> 40:20.858
Sorry.

40:22.215 --> 40:26.240
Look, I'm having a bad night, and I really need a drink.

40:26.897 --> 40:28.569
You and me both.

40:43.396 --> 40:44.595
Matt?

40:51.885 --> 40:53.212
Oh, my God.

41:03.479 --> 41:04.839
What happened?

41:06.844 --> 41:08.497
Like you don't know.

41:28.033 --> 41:29.506
What are you doing here?

41:29.902 --> 41:31.159
You tell me.

41:45.906 --> 41:47.983
There's another bus in an hour.

41:57.952 --> 42:00.299
What do I have to do to get you to stay?

42:02.939 --> 42:04.611
I think you're doing it.

42:39.327 --> 42:42.026
Glad to see you came back. I wasn't sure if I should, uh...

42:42.027 --> 42:43.528
No more talking.

42:47.525 --> 42:49.269
Here, let me help you with that.
