WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:14.890
I promise you, I was not trying to escape.
You gotta believe me.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.934
Okay, so what were you doing outside?

00:17.017 --> 00:20.229
Just pawing through the valet basket
for your keys so you could, what,

00:20.312 --> 00:22.814
take a Hungry Hungry Hippos poster
and put it in your trunk?

00:22.898 --> 00:24.107
Steal some memorabilia?

00:24.191 --> 00:26.485
Here, take this note.
Try to find more in the trash.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.903
I don't even like that movie.

00:27.986 --> 00:31.823
- I mean, yeah, it had some funny parts--
- Yeah, it did. A lot of funny parts.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.075
Calm down.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.035
So what were you doing outside?

00:38.080 --> 00:41.041
I can tell you guys,
but I just-- I can't do it here.

00:42.417 --> 00:46.046
- Brett? What did you do?
- A little misunderstanding, it's fine.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.174
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.518
Yasper? Yasper?

01:41.602 --> 01:44.104
- Hey. Hey, what did Brett say?
- Why are you in the shower?

01:44.188 --> 01:47.524
I started writing a tribute song.
The acoustics here are incredible. Listen.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.948
Amazing.
Truly. Did you look through the trash?

01:55.032 --> 01:57.659
Oh, no. There's a wet tissue on top,
so I'm not touching it.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.288
Yasper. Okay, I'm gonna find a way
to listen in on Brett's interrogation.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.123
Aniq, we can do it from here.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.876
Listen, this intercom connects
to the entire house.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.503
So right now we're in bathroom 3.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.088
If you go to the recording studio,
you press the following.

02:10.172 --> 02:14.384
"Home," "Intercom," "Enter," "Main Floor,"
"Bathroom 3," "Enter," "Enter," "Home."

02:14.468 --> 02:16.887
Then me, on this side,
I'll press "Accept" and "Mute."

02:16.970 --> 02:19.806
We could hear everything they say.
They can't hear us.

02:19.890 --> 02:20.933
That's amazing.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.435
Thank you so much.
I actually installed it myself.

02:23.519 --> 02:26.230
It took four hours, but two of those
hours, I went on his computer

02:26.313 --> 02:29.983
to get Channing Tatum's email address.
Then I took a nap and charged him double.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.861
Okay, so this is what it is, okay?
"Home," "Intercom," "Enter."

02:32.945 --> 02:35.447
"Hillary is eating my fettuccine
before three Englishmen eat hers."

02:35.531 --> 02:37.741
I don't like it. What are you doing?
Is it a porno?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.368
No, it's a mnemonic, actually.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.578
It's a-- a super easy way
to remember long lists.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.082
One of my escape room puzzles uses 'em.
Yeah, in this one, "Hillary" is "Home."

02:45.165 --> 02:47.584
Woof, woof, woof. That means you get it?
Understand what's going on?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.586
- I do, yeah.
- Come on. Pa-pow.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.338
Tell me everything from the beginning.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.006
- From the beginning?
- Mm-hmm.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.134
Guess you could say
I was a little late to the party.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.762
- Hey. I-I'm so sorry to interrupt.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.347
I lost my phone. I think--

03:00.430 --> 03:02.432
- I think I might've left it in here.
- Quickly.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.102
Uh, do you mind if--
I know I was sitting down there.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.813
- Yeah, I got you. Got you.
- Do you mind if I could--

03:07.896 --> 03:10.774
Let's see. Ah, no, it's not there.

03:10.858 --> 03:14.444
Okay. Look, if I can trace--
I was like-- It-- It might--

03:14.528 --> 03:16.154
Maybe it's, like, under the table?

03:16.989 --> 03:18.365
You asking me to look for it?

03:18.448 --> 03:20.534
It'd be inappropriate
for me to go in there.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.244
- So, if you don't mind.
- You pushing it.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.079
You lucky I'm a nice person.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.373
I'm retracin' my steps.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.584
I think I was over here for a minute.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.756
- What the hell?
- Uh, I'm so sorry.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.884
- What the hell is going on?
- He just pushed--

03:36.967 --> 03:39.678
- Ma'am, he just pushed all those buttons.
- No, I was--

03:39.761 --> 03:42.973
- I bumped into it accidentally--
- You don't bump into something like that.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.893
Turn it off.
This is-- You're making it worse.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.645
So loud. The bar's coming up, stop it!

03:48.729 --> 03:51.982
- There's not a "Back" button.
- "Accidentally" turn it off.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.735
- It's so loud.
- Uh-oh. What's happening in here?

03:54.818 --> 03:56.820
Feels like an AV problem.
I'll take care of it.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.865
You know, I installed this thing,
so I know how it works.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.617
- There it goes.
- Look at that.

04:02.326 --> 04:05.537
And by the way, if you guys want
one of these AV systems in your house,

04:05.621 --> 04:07.623
I could hook that up.
I don't have any business cards

04:07.706 --> 04:10.125
'cause it's the future,
but I could airdrop you my information.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.377
- Both, out. Now. Out. Now.
- You got it. Thank you.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.796
- Yep. Thank you very much.
- Wait. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.964
- Smarty-pants, smarty-pants.
- Whoa, whoa.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.175
What about your phone?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.844
- Okay, so we checked there. And I know--
- It's in your pocket.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.596
- Is it?
- I can see it right now.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.641
Oh-- Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.268
- See-- Oh, that is so me.
- Get out.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.938
- Can't believe that worked.
- I know, I'm a hero. No, no, no, no.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.482
- I'm so sorry. We're about to go in there.
- Bathroom emergency.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.692
You understand, don't you?
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.411
Don't. Aniq, don't, don't, don't.
Oh, your fingers are touching it.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.705
- Turn on the thing.
- Don't touch it with your hand.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.668
- About 0815.
- In the morning?

04:52.751 --> 04:53.877
- You hear it?
- No.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.671
- It worked.
- 2015.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.257
So, you say you were late to the party?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.175
No, I left home late.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.553
Got to the party right on time.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.192
Like a glove.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.656
"If I ever take a shot to the head."

05:22.739 --> 05:25.284
"If I quiver and quake
and fall down dead."

05:25.367 --> 05:27.828
"Aw, screw it. Let's just drink instead."

05:28.620 --> 05:31.331
- Brett the 'Vette.
- Ned the Sled. How are you, brother?

05:31.415 --> 05:34.334
Ah, crushing.
Man, word was you weren't coming tonight.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.044
- Eh.
- Sorry to hear about the divorce.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.672
Oh, it's a separation.
I haven't signed the papers yet.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.424
- Mmm.
- Still hoping I can make it work.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.467
Aw, man. You doing all right?

05:43.135 --> 05:46.221
It's tough. I still love her a lot.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.892
Zoë and Maggie are the best things
that ever happened to me.

05:49.975 --> 05:53.103
The most important thing
in this world is family.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.647
- Brett?
- Oh, shit.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.274
Hey, what's up?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.692
What are you doing here?

05:58.775 --> 06:01.987
We agreed this is my night.
You were gonna stay home with Maggie.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.948
Listen, Maggie's fine. All right?
I hired Veronica to babysit.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.492
Just so you know,
I know that we are not here together.

06:07.576 --> 06:08.577
Correct.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.288
But if there's a fire
or some kind of emergency situation,

06:11.371 --> 06:15.167
I will save you as I recently became
a part-time volunteer firefighter.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.376
- Don't know if you knew.
- Yes.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.004
You've texted me many times about that.
And that's really brave,

06:19.087 --> 06:21.465
but I thought you weren't interested
in coming to this?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.425
I mean, it's my reunion too, Zo.

06:24.176 --> 06:29.556
Okay, fine. But I wanna have fun tonight.
And that means I don't wanna deal with us.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.602
Totally. Totally.
And what kind of fun are we talking?

06:33.685 --> 06:36.772
Is it like "A few glasses of wine
with the girls" fun?

06:36.855 --> 06:40.734
Or like "Drink hard, go hard,

06:40.817 --> 06:43.904
make mistakes that you regret
in the morning" kind of fun?

06:43.987 --> 06:46.448
- We'll see.
- Who's we?

06:46.532 --> 06:49.076
- Have a good night, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.869
I'll catch you-- catch you around.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.457
If I had any chance
of putting my family back together,

06:55.541 --> 06:58.502
I had to make sure Zoë didn't do
something she couldn't take back.

06:58.585 --> 07:02.965
Ah. So, uh,
the good old cockblock? The clam jam?

07:03.048 --> 07:06.426
- No, no. No clam jam.
- Yeah, yeah. You was tryna jam her clam.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.428
I was not--
Please don't write "jamming her clam."

07:08.512 --> 07:11.431
- You was keeping her from getting that D.
- I was preserving my family.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.727
Operation Silent Savior was a go.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.320
Homemade cheese, sir?

07:27.239 --> 07:29.408
So I infiltrated the party and mingled.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.201
Got eyes on the objective.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.329
Totally inconspicuous.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.000
- Brett. Look at you. How are you?
- Jesus.

07:38.083 --> 07:41.378
Indigo. Uh, good, good, good.
It's g-- good to see you.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.380
What are you-- What've you been up to?

07:44.131 --> 07:47.968
As you know, humans are the only animals
that drink another animal's milk.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.095
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- It's barbaric.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.597
I have created an online group

07:51.680 --> 07:54.975
devoted to promoting
homemade human breast milk cheese.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.476
- No, no.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.812
Not the cheese that you're eating.
That's torture.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.147
What you're eating is agony.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.567
Okay, so this woman is going on
about her breast milk cheese, okay?

08:03.650 --> 08:06.111
But I had to keep an eye on Zoë, right?

08:06.195 --> 08:11.241
Now, luckily, she was talking to that guy,
Aniq, which is like-- Threat level zero.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.285
Threat level zero?

08:13.368 --> 08:15.329
Come on,
I'm at least a threat level seven.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.706
Eh… I'd give you, like, a three.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.542
Nothing. Smooth. Smooth down there.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.419
Like, he's almost like, uh…

08:23.378 --> 08:24.922
- Urkel.
- Wait, hold up.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.090
Steve Urkel.
He reminds me of him sexually.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.884
I'ma need you to hold your horses, okay?

08:28.967 --> 08:32.429
Because Steve Urkel is someone
I had a huge crush on.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.764
He was the first Black man

08:33.847 --> 08:36.850
that I ever heard of
that had his own cereal, okay?

08:36.933 --> 08:40.354
Plus, he was a genius.
Have you ever worn suspenders?

08:40.437 --> 08:42.356
But I know--
When I'm wearing my suspenders,

08:42.438 --> 08:44.525
I'm not like--

08:44.608 --> 08:46.652
If you hate on Urkel one more time…

08:49.404 --> 08:51.365
Did I do that? Okay, look.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.076
Regardless, I felt safer
with her talking to Aniq,

08:54.159 --> 08:56.203
so it was the perfect time
to empty the tanks.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.552
Hello, Brett.

09:13.804 --> 09:14.805
Hello, Eugene.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.266
It's Xavier now.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.142
Oh, is it? I hadn't heard.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.526
- Nice flow.
- Oh.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.780
Just getting started, partner.
This right here, this is first gear.

09:39.705 --> 09:40.873
Oh, my God.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.124
I could do this for hours.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.295
Hey, watch me change pitch.

09:51.383 --> 09:54.303
I'm playing this urinal
like a goddamn steel drum.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.597
Too bad you're not in Jamaica, Jack.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.059
- Yeah, you want loud?
- I need loud.

10:01.143 --> 10:04.146
- Is that what you want? You want loud?
- Let's see what you got.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.564
Prick up your ears.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.611
Oh, Jesus.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.197
- It hurts. It hurts.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.281
Tap out.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.158
Back to normal.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.411
Sounds like you're running out of gas,
amigo.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.872
- You're starting to question yourself.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.626
You're starting to second-guess.
You know that you're running out of piss.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.128
Yeah, it's over. Oh.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.881
I'm sorry.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.551
Nice try, kiddo. But no one pees like me.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.891
- So, Zoë's looking good tonight.
- Okay. What are you up to, Eugene?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.017
- Me?
- Yeah.

10:42.893 --> 10:46.313
Just thinking about all those times
you mocked and bullied me in high school.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.566
That's right. Mr. Tiny Pee-Pee Penis.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.151
Yeah, you've never seen my penis.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.612
You know,

10:53.695 --> 10:56.907
I thought I'd spend the night convincing
the Jennifers to cheat on their husbands

10:56.990 --> 10:59.618
'cause I've never had sex with
two pregnant women at the same time.

10:59.701 --> 11:03.455
But now I'm gonna set my sights
on your ex-wife instead.

11:03.539 --> 11:05.958
You wish. You're not her type.

11:06.041 --> 11:10.254
Neither are you. Not anymore.
I'll see you out there, champ.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.965
Oh, and I coulda kept pissing.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.133
Paced that shit,
I've still got half a tank.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.343
That is impossible.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.470
And now I'm gonna have sex with your ex.

11:19.263 --> 11:22.516
Ooh, that rhymes.
Should use that in a song.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.487
Good acoustics in bathrooms.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.699
You bastard! Come back here.
Wait, I'm not done with you.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.326
Why do I hydrate so well?

11:43.078 --> 11:45.247
Over. Over. Yeah.

11:51.920 --> 11:52.921
Son of a--

11:53.672 --> 11:55.465
I was too late.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.050
And I didn't wanna make a scene.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.802
I needed a clear line of sight.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.096
- Anyone sitting here?
- Please-- Please sit.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.556
That's your-- That's you, baby.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.025
You okay?

12:13.108 --> 12:15.527
I'm not gonna let him ruin my family.
I'm--

12:18.113 --> 12:20.157
Family. That's it.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.328
Hey.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.788
- Operation Nostalgia was a go.
- Walt.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.758
What's up, man? I'm not hearing anything
out of that speaker there.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.885
- Really?
- You're running mono, my friend.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.887
- Again? I'll check it out.
- Aw, sorry.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.598
I couldn't hear anything,
so I figured I'd come and tell you.

12:44.681 --> 12:45.516
Appreciate it.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.684
Time to hack into the mainframe.

12:49.686 --> 12:53.482
Okay, activate Facebook protocol.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.402
Come on. Password, "Diarrhea."

12:59.238 --> 13:00.572
Oh, shit.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.575
Son of a bitch, Wi-Fi.

13:03.659 --> 13:04.993
Come on. Come on.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.080
- Hey, Alexis, watch that wire.
- Shit.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.166
- What was it?
- Someone pulled a wire out.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.835
Oh, my Go-- Who would do that?

13:12.918 --> 13:16.630
Oh, hey, uh, the Jenns told me to tell you
to go ahead and start the slideshow now.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.341
No, I'm under strict orders.
They wanna do it after dessert.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.553
Sometimes in life, things change.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.430
- You-- Okay. Uh…

13:25.931 --> 13:29.810
Now I know I seem
like this chiseled, rock-hard tough guy,

13:29.893 --> 13:32.688
but when it comes to my family,
even I get a little choked up.

13:32.771 --> 13:33.814
And I knew Zoë--

13:33.897 --> 13:36.733
…is gonna cry her eyes out.

13:41.738 --> 13:42.781
Beautiful day.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.619
No.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.080
Uh, hey, Brett? It's me, Walt.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.583
- Do you remember me?
- Of course. Good to see ya.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.460
- Well, what's my name?
- Why are you asking me that right now?

13:55.544 --> 13:56.587
I just said my name's Walt.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.505
- I said, "Hey, it's me, Walt."
- Cool story.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.508
Brett!

14:01.592 --> 14:04.845
Old friends. Oldest friends.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.556
Peter, do you remember me?

14:11.685 --> 14:14.021
- Oh! God!
- Oh, my God.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.939
What the hell are you doing here, Chelsea?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.149
What are you doing here?

14:17.232 --> 14:20.402
Wait. Shh, I know. You're looking for Zoë.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.905
- Yes. Yes.
- You're looking for Zoë.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.199
I am. I need to find her.
Have you seen her?

14:25.908 --> 14:28.493
I haven't. Oh, wait.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.245
Yes. No, yes, I did. I did.

14:30.329 --> 14:32.539
I saw her-- Oh, my God.
Can you hold on one second?

14:32.623 --> 14:34.458
- I'm getting a call. Hello?
- Yes. Yes.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.252
- Just kidding, nobody there.
- Fuck. God, stop it. Where is she?

14:37.336 --> 14:38.879
You know what? I'm just--

14:40.130 --> 14:41.715
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.009
Key, key, key, right back there.
Zip, zip, zip.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.345
It's women's code. I can't tell you.

14:46.428 --> 14:50.098
Okay. This is man's code, okay?
Was she with Xavier?

14:50.182 --> 14:52.476
What about Xavier? You hate him. Also?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.811
That doesn't matter.
What matters is I find her.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.063
What matters is that

14:56.146 --> 14:58.732
- I have some plans for Xavier tonight.
- What does that mean?

14:58.815 --> 15:00.817
Remember St. Patrick's Day
at your uncle's house?

15:00.901 --> 15:05.072
My uncle lives in Tucson. You--
You flipped out, right? You know that?

15:05.155 --> 15:08.617
- You know you lost your shit, right?
- Oh, no. All I know is what I know.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.662
And I know that he knows what I know.
And you're gonna find out soon.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.164
And everybody will find out soon.
The truth.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.792
Yeah. The truth is you're an alcoholic.

15:16.875 --> 15:20.212
Chelsea was mad at Xavier
about some shit that he did to her,

15:20.295 --> 15:24.925
and she was hatching a plan
to do something about it. Yeah.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.009
Whoa, dude.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.971
Me and my grandma
used to watch a lot of soap operas. Yeah.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.056
- Oh, check this out.
- Have you written for one?

15:31.139 --> 15:32.850
'Cause it sounds like
you're making up some shit.

15:34.226 --> 15:38.564
"Now's the time to feel the pain.
What goes around comes around."

15:38.647 --> 15:40.774
- You think Chelsea wrote it?
- I don't know.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.026
But whoever did
definitely could've killed Xavier.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.572
- Holy shit. Are we solving this?
- Okay.

15:51.159 --> 15:53.662
Oh, hey. We need to get
the hell out of here right now.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.290
Veronica had some emergency,
so now Maggie is here.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.375
- You need to take her home.
- Okay. Listen.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.961
Eugene is taking advantage of you.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.421
No, no, no. I'm not doing this.

16:02.504 --> 16:05.424
That shirtless twerp is only trying to
hook up with you to get back at me

16:05.507 --> 16:07.217
for some shit I did to him in high school.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.261
You think everything is always about you.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.722
Only when it is. I'm trying to help you.
You can't see that

16:11.805 --> 16:14.850
because you're so horned up to
get boned by that little greasy shitbag.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.602
- Daddy!
- Hey. Hey.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.188
I heard ya crashed the party.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.898
Sorry. She's--

16:22.191 --> 16:25.694
- She is so fast. And she's--
- You okay?

16:25.777 --> 16:27.988
I am going to go
to the after-party at Xavier's,

16:28.071 --> 16:30.490
and if you care about me,
you won't be there.

16:31.074 --> 16:34.286
- Daddy, are you gonna take me home?
- Course I am, pumpkin.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.913
You won't see me again tonight.

16:36.455 --> 16:38.332
You have my word.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.459
And my word is my bond.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.461
It's the only thing I've got
that's worth a damn.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.296
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.548
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye. I'll see you in the morning.

16:46.632 --> 16:49.551
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Go get some pure oxygen.

16:50.052 --> 16:54.181
You-- You're Captain Chuck Hazard.
From Hungry, Hungry Hippos.

16:56.558 --> 17:01.230
Those hungry,
hungry hippos have lost their marbles.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.650
Yeah, wasn't-- wasn't that funny, but…

17:04.733 --> 17:08.069
Hey, I'll watch after your mom for you
tonight, okay? Make sure she's happy.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.154
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.867
Don't worry, you won't miss anything
at the after-party.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.327
'Cause you weren't invited.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.746
Dude! Six years old.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.790
Daddy, I love him.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.541
All right, let's go home.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.795
Daddy, that man has my koala!

17:24.877 --> 17:26.046
Wait, who? Xavier?

17:26.128 --> 17:28.382
No! Daddy, that man.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.551
Hey, stop that car!

17:32.678 --> 17:33.679
What?

17:35.264 --> 17:36.723
Nailed it.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.685
No, no, no, no, no! No!

17:40.811 --> 17:44.356
Daddy, I can't sleep without my koala.
I need him.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.276
Listen to me, honey.
I'm gonna get your koala back,

17:47.359 --> 17:50.612
and you have my word.
And my word is my bond.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.907
And that's the only thing
that you've got that's worth a damn.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.242
Except for you, pumpkin.

17:57.995 --> 18:01.039
Remember when I let you watch Deadpool 2,
and you promised you wouldn't tell Mom?

18:01.123 --> 18:03.750
- Yeah.
- This is like that.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.085
Hit it!

18:11.258 --> 18:13.135
Operation Koala Extract is a go.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.556
- Faster, Daddy, faster!
- Look for his car, honey.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.850
It's a little green lime piece of shit--
Piece of trash.

18:25.564 --> 18:26.940
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

18:27.024 --> 18:28.025
There he is.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.403
- Time to make the doughnuts.
- I want a doughnut.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.239
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

18:37.910 --> 18:39.953
Hey! Koala.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.205
- What?
- What is he saying?

18:41.288 --> 18:42.664
I need Maggie's koala.

18:42.748 --> 18:44.583
- Hey, what?
- Koala.

18:44.666 --> 18:45.751
What are you saying?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.419
Koala! She needs her koala!

18:47.503 --> 18:48.921
- He's speaking Hawaiian.
- No.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.256
Koala!

18:53.425 --> 18:54.927
There he goes. Crap.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.430
Hang tight here.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.518
- Whoa!
- It's fun.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.980
Don't you think that's a little dangerous?

19:07.064 --> 19:10.067
Driving around all crazy like that
with your child in the back?

19:10.150 --> 19:13.153
Her car seat has
a seven-point restraint system,

19:13.237 --> 19:16.365
latch anchors, side airbags, okay?

19:16.448 --> 19:19.952
She was totally safe
and having the time of her life.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.664
- Whoa!
- Whoo-hoo!

19:26.750 --> 19:29.253
- You want some fruit snacks?
- Yeah!

19:31.839 --> 19:35.133
Thanks. You're the best dad ever.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.386
You're the best daughter ever.

19:39.930 --> 19:42.432
Dangerous game you're playing, my friend.
Whoa!

19:43.809 --> 19:44.977
He's going right? So am I.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.982
I'm gonna cut 'em off.

19:50.858 --> 19:52.442
- There! Right there!
- I see 'em.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.444
Hold on tight.

19:55.654 --> 19:56.864
I got you, dog.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.660
I see him! I see him!
There he is! There he is!

20:02.160 --> 20:03.161
Oh, we lost him.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.663
I never lose.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.791
- I got your ass.
- Daddy, say "butt."

20:07.875 --> 20:09.084
I got your butt.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.254
Whoa!

20:15.674 --> 20:18.177
- There he is! There he is!
- No!

20:19.344 --> 20:20.512
Holy sh--

20:21.263 --> 20:22.306
Hold on, baby.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.351
- Daddy, truck!
- No, no, no, no, no.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.230
- Hey!
- What?

20:30.314 --> 20:32.941
- Move that piece of shit truck!
- We're working here!

20:33.025 --> 20:34.735
You are so lucky my kid's in this car,

20:34.818 --> 20:36.528
'cause if she wasn't, I'd come out there,

20:36.612 --> 20:39.114
- I'd whip your ass--
- Hey, Juan, we got one!

20:39.198 --> 20:40.741
- I was joking!
- I didn't think so!

20:40.824 --> 20:42.451
No, no, no, no, no!

20:42.534 --> 20:45.204
It's okay, Daddy, I don't need my koala.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.039
I could just hug a towel.

20:47.122 --> 20:51.293
No way. I made you a promise.
But where we're going…

20:53.420 --> 20:55.631
It's the one place I swore I'd never go.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.884
I could get there
if this person would move.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.010
Honey, do me a favor?

21:00.093 --> 21:03.096
- Can you hum your quiet song?

21:03.180 --> 21:04.181
There you go.

21:05.349 --> 21:06.350
Hey, dipshit!

21:06.433 --> 21:08.560
How about I pull your heart
out of your asshole?

21:14.024 --> 21:15.567
Hey. Keep that here, okay?

21:16.401 --> 21:19.154
All right, sweetheart,
I'm gonna go inside, get your koala, okay?

21:19.238 --> 21:21.573
But I need you to stay in the car. Got it?

21:21.657 --> 21:23.116
I got it.

21:24.076 --> 21:27.371
Sir, you have to leave
the premises immediately.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.581
- You're not welcome here.
- Uh-oh.

21:29.665 --> 21:32.835
Brother man, I'm going into that house
to get something.

21:33.836 --> 21:37.172
Either I go through you,
or you go through me.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.591
You shouldn't have…

21:40.175 --> 21:41.468
Hyah!

21:42.970 --> 21:44.054
Ooh!

21:44.137 --> 21:46.807
It's okay, baby. We went to high school
together, and we're catching up.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.684
- Daddy, watch out!
- Oh!

21:53.313 --> 21:54.731
I'm too young for this shit.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.401
Hyah!

22:03.073 --> 22:04.491
Oh, boy.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.036
- You okay, Daddy?
- It's okay, honey.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.122
I'm helping him with his back problem.

22:10.205 --> 22:13.250
Just a second.
We're having a lot of fun. I love this.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.294
What's that? You moved to Sacramento?

22:20.257 --> 22:21.925
- Oh!

22:22.009 --> 22:23.844
- It's so good catching up.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.262
Yeah.

22:39.568 --> 22:40.569
Come on.

22:46.325 --> 22:48.410
Okay. Enough of this shit.

22:53.207 --> 22:54.791
You got skills,

22:54.875 --> 22:56.585
but you ain't got a skillet.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.591
Order up.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.884
Yay, Daddy!

23:04.718 --> 23:05.761
Smells good.

23:12.351 --> 23:13.810
Excuse me, hello, I'm hungry.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.689
Uh, wait. I want one more.

23:17.773 --> 23:19.816
- Okay, you can go.
- Please enjoy.

23:19.900 --> 23:23.445
I needed to regain control,
or I would lose my family.

23:23.529 --> 23:25.906
I had to get in and out
for a quick extraction.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.909
And then, target acquired.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.327
Here, try one of these.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.247
Oh, I had a stew before I came out,
thank you.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.459
Hey, dork.

23:37.543 --> 23:41.046
- What? Oh.
- Where's the koala?

23:41.129 --> 23:42.381
Sorry, bud.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.216
I don't have the "koalafications."

23:44.299 --> 23:45.843
Where is the animal?

23:45.926 --> 23:48.512
Get off me. Don't touch me like that.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.680
- Ow. Whoa!

23:49.763 --> 23:51.723
- Get off me.
- What do we got here?

23:51.807 --> 23:53.475
Will you look at that.

23:53.559 --> 23:55.519
I've never seen that in my life.

23:55.602 --> 23:59.481
You're a bad person.
You steal from children.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.608
Back off, ch-- Wow.

24:06.446 --> 24:09.157
- Brett?
- Oh, uh, uh, no. No.

24:09.241 --> 24:11.618
- My prawns!
- He started it! He pushed me!

24:11.702 --> 24:14.913
He started the whole thing!
Shit! I'm dead. I am dead.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.208
Zoë, don't be mad.

24:18.292 --> 24:21.879
I asked you to do one thing,
do not come to this after-party.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.505
And-- Wait, where is Maggie?

24:23.589 --> 24:29.303
Oh, she's down in… my parents' basement,
watching Moana. She's very happy.

24:29.386 --> 24:32.639
- Can I please talk to you for two minutes?
- Zoë, is this man bothering you?

24:32.723 --> 24:36.351
Hey, do you wanna go right now? I've been
thinking about kicking your ass all night.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.061
- Brett.
- Then what are you waiting for?

24:38.145 --> 24:39.313
An invitation, my friend.

24:39.396 --> 24:41.648
You are cordially invited.
How do you RSVP?

24:41.732 --> 24:43.066
- Guys, this is--
- For sure.

24:43.150 --> 24:45.819
- We're about to get filthy.
- Hey, nice hat, by the way.

24:45.903 --> 24:48.780
- Did Sam Jackson have a yard sale?
- Nah, wardrobe change.

24:48.864 --> 24:50.490
Okay, you look like Prince took a shit.

24:50.574 --> 24:52.159
- Thank you so much.
- I am done with this.

24:52.242 --> 24:55.078
- It's not a compliment!
- Stop it! Oh, my God.

24:55.162 --> 24:58.498
You guys wanna have
your little slap fight, go ahead.

24:58.582 --> 25:01.293
But I am not going to be
a prize you can win.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.879
- Zoë, but I have--
- No, I agree with you. I'm a feminist!

25:06.173 --> 25:09.843
- We doing this?
- Oh, it's about to be done, dog.

25:09.927 --> 25:13.055
- Step into my arena, dog.
- Thank you for having me, bitch.

25:13.138 --> 25:16.433
I really, actually, non-ironically,
like how you designed this place.

25:16.517 --> 25:18.852
That's a very kind observation.

25:18.936 --> 25:20.103
Yeah, here's another one:

25:20.187 --> 25:22.898
this fist, right now,
is about to go right into your windpipe.

25:22.981 --> 25:25.150
It's gonna mess up your vocal cords so bad

25:25.234 --> 25:27.945
that even your precious Auto-Tune
won't be able to save you.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.112
Can't wait.

25:29.196 --> 25:34.910
And just as you're thinking,
"Oh, my career is over. It's over," boom!

25:34.993 --> 25:37.871
This fist is gonna crack your sternum
like a piñata, bitch.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.290
"X" marks the punch spot.

25:40.374 --> 25:44.044
And then all your guts and your ribs
are gonna spill out of your chest cavity

25:44.127 --> 25:46.964
like candy at a quinceañera, tú sabes?

25:47.798 --> 25:50.717
Me do sabes real good.

25:50.801 --> 25:53.262
Oh. Muy bien.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.472
Go for it, big man.

25:55.556 --> 25:58.267
All you'll do is prove who you really are.

25:58.350 --> 26:00.686
You try to control her,
you try to control me,

26:00.769 --> 26:03.856
but the truth is
you're the one who's out of control.

26:07.901 --> 26:09.862
The asshole was right.

26:09.945 --> 26:13.031
It's why my marriage fell apart.
I wanted to control everyone,

26:13.115 --> 26:17.286
but in the end,
the person I couldn't control was myself.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.370
Yeah.

26:18.453 --> 26:21.081
You just got two big turds
at the end of your wrists.

26:23.125 --> 26:26.336
This whole aggro routine is old hat.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.922
And I… I'm new hat.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.633
I'm cool new hat.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.221
That hat sucks.

26:37.556 --> 26:40.809
Whoa. Hey, hey! Yo, what the hell?

26:40.893 --> 26:44.062
Dude, that was a bullshit overpriced hat
that looks stupid, man!

26:46.732 --> 26:49.401
I knew it! The hat fell first.

26:49.484 --> 26:51.612
Ooh, I am good.

26:52.988 --> 26:55.115
Okay, anyways, what happened next?

27:04.124 --> 27:08.253
You were right
about why I came to the reunion tonight.

27:09.296 --> 27:11.381
The truth is,

27:12.758 --> 27:17.971
even after everything I did,
I could not accept that we were through.

27:20.849 --> 27:25.062
And I… I thought if I could just hold on,

27:26.188 --> 27:27.981
I could keep you from moving on.

27:28.065 --> 27:31.443
Zo, I'm so sorry.
For-- For everything.

27:31.527 --> 27:33.695
I just want you to be happy.

27:35.030 --> 27:38.408
Even if that means you end up with Xavier.

27:38.492 --> 27:41.078
Oh, God, ew. He sucks.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.413
Ah. Oh.

27:49.294 --> 27:51.088
I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:51.171 --> 27:54.633
I'm so glad to hear you say that.
He's such a turd.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.846
Oh, my God. I'm gonna go.

27:58.929 --> 28:03.058
I'm gonna go home,
and I'm gonna sign our divorce papers.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.726
And from now on,

28:04.810 --> 28:10.190
you are gonna get nothing
but openness and honesty from me.

28:10.274 --> 28:11.775
- Forever.
- Thank you.

28:11.859 --> 28:16.280
I know this kind of real talk
can be hard for you.

28:16.864 --> 28:20.742
I've actually been going
through my own stuff tonight.

28:20.826 --> 28:24.830
You know, wondering
what I want from this next…

28:28.292 --> 28:29.585
I shit my pants.

28:29.668 --> 28:30.878
Again?

28:30.961 --> 28:33.839
I can't believe it. I go-- gotta go.
I gotta go. Don't tell anyone.

28:33.922 --> 28:36.800
I'm so embarrassed. Oh, my God.
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

28:36.884 --> 28:38.552
- Look away, please. Oh, God.
- Oh, my--

28:40.929 --> 28:43.265
- Have you seen a six-year-old girl?
- What does she look like?

28:43.348 --> 28:46.685
What does she look li-- She's six.
She's the only child at the party.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.353
- Tell me when to stop.
- Keep going.

28:49.146 --> 28:50.397
More, more, more, more, more, more, more.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.691
- Right there!
- I've never seen anybody that small.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.359
- A girl?
- Yes, a girl! A little girl.

28:54.443 --> 28:55.777
Dude, I am so distracted.

28:55.861 --> 28:58.030
I'm sorry,
I'm about to make musical history.

29:01.491 --> 29:03.619
Oh, sorry, Quiet Heather…

29:04.286 --> 29:07.873
Mr. Shapiro?
Forget it. Forget it. I'm sorry. Sorry!

29:09.541 --> 29:12.794
Then I saw Chelsea talking to Xavier.

29:12.878 --> 29:15.672
You know,
I'd really, really like to get you alone.

29:16.423 --> 29:19.134
Yeah? What are you gonna do to me?

29:19.218 --> 29:21.678
Chelsea was with Xavier?

29:21.762 --> 29:24.973
And she had a look on her face
that was very devilish.

29:25.057 --> 29:26.183
She was like…

29:27.434 --> 29:33.232
'Kay, she looked like Jack Nicholson
in Witches of Eastwick.

29:33.315 --> 29:35.108
Anyway, I found Maggie.

29:35.192 --> 29:37.611
- Oh, my God, Maggie.
- Daddy, look. It's a puppy!

29:37.694 --> 29:39.696
Can we get a puppy?
I want a puppy. Please?

29:39.780 --> 29:42.824
Yes. If we leave right now.
And we have to play a little game called

29:42.908 --> 29:44.993
Sneak Out the Backdoor
So Mommy Doesn't See Us.

29:45.077 --> 29:46.495
- Fun!
- Let's go.

29:58.841 --> 29:59.925
What?

30:00.509 --> 30:01.677
Watch your six.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.886
I am six.

30:03.679 --> 30:05.806
Shh. Go, go, go, go, go. Move. Move, move.

30:06.974 --> 30:10.018
There you go. And I got something for ya.

30:11.478 --> 30:12.896
Kevin!

30:14.857 --> 30:16.066
Oh, man. The valet's gone.

30:16.149 --> 30:18.694
Okay, listen. I'm gonna go in the house.
I'll be right…

30:20.737 --> 30:21.738
Back.

30:27.077 --> 30:29.204
- Someone call 911!

30:29.288 --> 30:31.832
Nobody touch anything.
This place is a crime scene!

30:31.915 --> 30:35.252
Brett?
Xavier is dead. Where are you going?

30:40.215 --> 30:41.717
- Nowhere.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.260
Maggie is still sleeping right now

30:43.343 --> 30:45.637
in the car in the driveway.
That's what I've been doing.

30:45.721 --> 30:48.223
I've been sneaking out every hour
just to check on her. That's it.

30:49.057 --> 30:51.810
Well, everything said
in this room is confidential,

30:51.894 --> 30:54.855
but lying to your ex,
it's not gonna turn out good for you.

30:54.938 --> 30:55.939
But you know what?

30:56.023 --> 30:59.818
I have a officer in the driveway,
and I'll have him watch over the car.

30:59.902 --> 31:02.905
You know, I almost feel bad for Brett.
Yeah, when he was chasing us,

31:02.988 --> 31:05.365
I thought he was trying to stop me
from being with Zoë,

31:05.449 --> 31:07.743
but really he was after
a koala for his kid.

31:07.826 --> 31:11.580
And then, you know, I thought I was
in this great duel over Zoë with Xavier,

31:11.663 --> 31:13.957
but really his rivalry was with Brett.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.669
It wasn't about me at all.
I misread everything.

31:17.753 --> 31:18.837
You can leave.

31:20.297 --> 31:22.257
Culp! Good. I need somebody to--

31:22.341 --> 31:24.218
- Captain called me.
- Really?

31:24.301 --> 31:26.678
- I didn't know you guys were friends.
- Oh, we're not.

31:26.762 --> 31:30.140
He just wanted me to hear it directly
from him that this is not our case.

31:30.224 --> 31:33.227
He only wanted us to collect witness
statements until Germain got here.

31:33.310 --> 31:38.148
Okay, so that is basically
what he said to me as well, but, uh--

31:38.232 --> 31:40.859
- Look, I can crack this thing, okay, and--
- You lied to me.

31:40.943 --> 31:42.277
You're being dramatic.

31:42.361 --> 31:45.322
- Do not call me dramatic.
- It's cool.

31:45.405 --> 31:49.660
Look, if I don't solve this case,
I promise you I will take the rap.

31:49.743 --> 31:52.120
I will not let any harm come to you.

31:52.204 --> 31:55.916
But this ringer guy that's coming?
I know him.

31:55.999 --> 31:59.545
And he will fuck this up.
Now, I'm not asking you to help me.

31:59.628 --> 32:03.298
I'm just asking you to not,
not help me, okay?

32:04.216 --> 32:06.593
Aniq's been
in the bathroom for 20 minutes.

32:06.677 --> 32:08.971
- I think he's up to something.
- I love you, man.

32:09.054 --> 32:11.139
- I love you too.
- You know what?

32:11.223 --> 32:13.350
Anything you want out of this house,
it is yours.

32:13.433 --> 32:14.810
We'll say it's evidence.

32:14.893 --> 32:17.145
- It's all yours.
- Are you serious?

32:17.229 --> 32:19.273
- All right, come with me.
- Okay.

32:22.526 --> 32:25.863
Know what we should do? We should give
that to Danner and tell her everything.

32:25.946 --> 32:28.240
And tell her we were listening in?
We don't have proof.

32:28.323 --> 32:31.785
Then we give it to Chelsea,
and we tell her that we know she wrote it.

32:31.869 --> 32:33.745
Do you really believe
Chelsea's a murderer?

32:33.829 --> 32:36.164
Danner said any one of us
could snap at any second.

32:36.248 --> 32:38.458
Why couldn't it be Chelsea? Aniq?

32:42.337 --> 32:43.672
Holy shit. Look at this.

32:45.966 --> 32:47.301
- You have diarrhea?
- No.

32:47.384 --> 32:49.595
- All right, look at the note.
- Yeah. I'm looking.

32:49.678 --> 32:52.097
- The E's.
- Oh. They're like, um…

32:52.181 --> 32:53.807
- Look like backwards threes.
- Backwards threes.

32:53.891 --> 32:54.975
If we add up the threes…

32:55.058 --> 32:56.476
- No. No.
- No, of course not.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.395
- Uh-- It's the same.
- What?

32:59.479 --> 33:00.522
Oh, my God!

33:01.815 --> 33:02.941
Do you actually g--

33:03.025 --> 33:05.861
The E's are the same.
All right, so whoever wrote this note…

33:05.944 --> 33:08.530
- Yeah, also wrote--
- …must have written this on my neck.

33:08.614 --> 33:11.742
Oh, my God. So if we find the person
who wrote that on your neck…

33:11.825 --> 33:13.076
We find the actual killer.

33:14.786 --> 33:15.871
Diarrhea Murderer.

33:15.954 --> 33:17.831
No.
I don't think we're gonna call him that.

33:17.915 --> 33:19.499
- You don't like that?
- I do not like that.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.710
- Montezuma's Revenger.
- Mm-mmm.

33:21.793 --> 33:23.629
You don't like that one?
Uh, Splash the Ripper.

33:23.712 --> 33:25.088
- Yeah.
- Ooh, no. Heavens no.

33:25.172 --> 33:27.216
- We'll get to it though.
- So…

33:27.299 --> 33:28.717
So, this is good.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.095
We couldn't have found a better piece
of evidence in this whole house, right?
