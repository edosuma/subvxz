WEBVTT

02:14.661 --> 02:16.370
- Yes?
- Andrew Wyke?

02:16.538 --> 02:18.539
That's right.

02:19.374 --> 02:20.999
I'm Milo Tindle.

02:21.167 --> 02:23.961
Oh, yes, good.

02:28.133 --> 02:30.217
Glad to meet you.

02:31.928 --> 02:34.096
You got the train to Charlebury,
did you?

02:34.264 --> 02:36.598
- I drove.
- Oh, you drove?

02:36.766 --> 02:37.933
That's my car.

02:38.101 --> 02:40.018
Oh, the little one?

02:40.186 --> 02:42.938
- Not the big one.
- No, the big one's mine.

02:43.106 --> 02:45.065
What do you think of it?

02:49.028 --> 02:50.445
- Very handsome.
- Yeah.

02:50.613 --> 02:52.781
It is, isn't it?

02:55.535 --> 02:57.244
Come in.

03:02.167 --> 03:05.794
I was watching a video
of one of my books on television.

03:11.176 --> 03:13.051
Like the house?

03:13.219 --> 03:14.720
Extraordinary.

03:14.888 --> 03:18.640
You know who designed it,
who the interior decorator was?

03:18.808 --> 03:21.185
Yes, your wife.

03:21.352 --> 03:22.811
You knew?

03:22.979 --> 03:24.688
Yes, I knew.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.899
I'll show you around later.

03:27.066 --> 03:28.734
Have a drink. I'm drinking vodka.

03:28.902 --> 03:31.570
- Scotch, please.
- Scotch.

03:31.738 --> 03:35.240
Milo, what an interesting name.
You're a foreigner, I take it?

03:35.408 --> 03:37.910
My father's Italian.

03:38.077 --> 03:40.287
Milo sounds Hungarian.

03:40.455 --> 03:42.122
Does it?

03:42.707 --> 03:44.708
Here's your Scotch.

03:47.837 --> 03:50.964
Cheers.

03:52.634 --> 03:55.761
You sure your father
isn't Hungarian?

03:55.929 --> 03:58.805
Well, if he is,
he's kept it a dead secret for years.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.600
- And your mother?
- English.

04:01.768 --> 04:04.269
So you're a kind of half-breed?

04:05.521 --> 04:07.314
Sit down.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.491
- Thanks for agreeing to see me.
- Not at all.

04:17.659 --> 04:19.785
I didn't know you wrote plays
for television.

04:19.952 --> 04:22.412
I don't. I write crime novels.
You must know that.

04:22.580 --> 04:23.622
I had heard.

04:23.790 --> 04:27.292
But sometimes they're adapted
for television by other people.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.711
You know what the word
adapted means, I take it?

04:29.879 --> 04:31.713
Adapted?

04:31.881 --> 04:33.966
They may not have such a word
in Italian.

04:34.133 --> 04:37.010
- I speak English.
- Good.

04:37.178 --> 04:40.639
Come and have a look
at my special book room.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.608
These are all my novels.

04:51.776 --> 04:53.819
You've read them, I suppose?

04:53.987 --> 04:55.862
Afraid not.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.990
Good God, no?
What about this one?

04:58.157 --> 05:00.450
- Rat in a Trap?
- No.

05:00.618 --> 05:02.244
- The Obelisk?
- No.

05:02.412 --> 05:03.453
- Blackout?
- No.

05:03.621 --> 05:06.123
- Dead Fish?
- Afraid not.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.166
God, you're one in a million.

05:08.334 --> 05:12.337
- Am I?
- Oh, absolu -- I'm very popular.

05:12.505 --> 05:14.548
You see this shelf?

05:15.174 --> 05:16.675
Translations.

05:16.843 --> 05:20.262
French, Dutch, German.

05:20.430 --> 05:22.222
You speak Dutch yourself, do you?

05:22.390 --> 05:25.559
Yes, how did you know?
I have a Dutch uncle.

05:25.727 --> 05:27.686
Can't see any Italian translations.

05:27.854 --> 05:32.065
No, they're a funny lot, the Italians.
Culture isn't really their thing.

05:32.233 --> 05:33.567
Their salami's good, though.

05:33.735 --> 05:36.486
- Oh, is it?
- Italian salami? Best in the world.

05:36.654 --> 05:38.488
Did you bring any with you?

05:38.656 --> 05:40.782
- No, I left it at home.
- Oh, shame.

05:40.950 --> 05:42.743
We're gonna have it
for supper tonight.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.745
With a couple of bottles
of Valpolicella.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.914
- We?
- Maggie and me.

05:49.125 --> 05:52.044
Your glass is empty.
What were you drinking, vodka?

05:52.211 --> 05:54.755
- Scotch.
- Scotch.

06:06.517 --> 06:08.685
I want to come to the point.

06:08.895 --> 06:10.187
Point? What point?

06:10.355 --> 06:12.272
Are you gonna give Maggie
a divorce?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.774
And if not, why not?

06:13.941 --> 06:16.360
Yeah, yes, yes, we'll come to that.

06:16.527 --> 06:18.528
She thinks
you're being unreasonable.

06:18.696 --> 06:20.280
So do I.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.658
She's never coming back to you,
so why not just give her the divorce?

06:23.826 --> 06:27.245
It'll do her good to wait for five years.
Good for her character.

06:27.413 --> 06:29.956
You're going to make her wait
five years?

06:30.124 --> 06:33.627
- That's the law. The law of the land.
- But that's pure spite.

06:33.795 --> 06:38.048
Anyway, we'll get back to that,
perhaps. Have your drink first.

06:41.552 --> 06:43.720
What do you do, by the way?

06:43.888 --> 06:45.472
I'm an actor.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.016
Good God. Are you really?

06:48.184 --> 06:50.977
I thought Maggie said
you were a hairdresser.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.271
She must have been talking
about someone else.

06:53.439 --> 06:54.940
You mean another friend?

06:55.108 --> 06:56.566
Another friend?

06:56.734 --> 06:58.485
She tends to have
more than one friend.

06:58.653 --> 06:59.945
- Does she?
- Oh, yes.

07:00.113 --> 07:01.488
I'm her only friend.

07:01.656 --> 07:03.198
She must be lonely.

07:03.366 --> 07:04.991
She's not.

07:05.159 --> 07:08.870
Acting is a pretty precarious
profession, isn't it?

07:09.038 --> 07:11.331
What are you acting in
at the moment?

07:11.499 --> 07:13.375
I'm out of work.

07:13.543 --> 07:14.584
Poor chap.

07:14.752 --> 07:17.504
I drive cars now and again,
chauffeuring.

07:17.672 --> 07:20.090
- Oh, tough life.
- I keep my head above water.

07:21.551 --> 07:23.844
What sort of parts do you play?

07:25.138 --> 07:27.180
Killers, mostly.

07:27.348 --> 07:30.392
Sex maniacs, perverts.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.185
But you're so charming.

07:32.353 --> 07:34.980
Yes, I know.
Anyway, what about this divorce?

07:35.148 --> 07:37.357
What's your position, exactly?

07:37.525 --> 07:40.026
All in good time.

07:48.870 --> 07:50.537
Come in.

07:57.587 --> 08:00.547
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.055
I understand you're fucking my wife.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.391
- That's right.
- Right.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.226
Yes, right.

08:13.394 --> 08:15.520
- So we've cleared that up.
- We have.

08:15.688 --> 08:17.898
- I thought you might deny it.
- Why would I deny it?

08:18.065 --> 08:20.901
- Well, she is my wife.
- Yes, but she's fucking me.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.778
Oh, she's fucking you too?
Well, I'll be buggered.

08:24.614 --> 08:26.364
- Sorry.
- Yes, it's mutual.

08:26.532 --> 08:28.241
- You take turns?
- We fuck each other.

08:28.409 --> 08:32.245
- That's what people do.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I follow.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.751
- We're in love.
- You're in love?

08:38.169 --> 08:39.419
That's right.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.217
Let me top you up.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.895
I heard a rumor
that you wanted to marry her.

08:57.063 --> 08:59.022
- That can't be true, can it?
- Why not?

08:59.190 --> 09:02.108
In this day and age,
is marriage absolutely necessary?

09:02.276 --> 09:03.318
Isn't it a bit old hat?

09:03.486 --> 09:05.362
- Is it?
- It's a mug's game.

09:05.530 --> 09:08.156
I wouldn't go near it if I were you.
You can't marry her.

09:08.324 --> 09:10.534
You can't marry her
because she's married to me.

09:10.701 --> 09:12.410
Unless I divorce her, of course.

09:12.578 --> 09:14.621
- And are you?
- Am I what?

09:14.789 --> 09:15.872
Going to divorce her?

09:16.040 --> 09:18.124
Are you really gonna
make her wait five years?

09:18.292 --> 09:21.211
- She wants to know.
- To be honest, I can't wait.

09:21.837 --> 09:24.589
But there are one or two things
I'd like to clear up first.

09:24.757 --> 09:29.427
For example, I've never heard
of an Italian called Tindle.

09:29.595 --> 09:31.054
My father's name is Tindolini.

09:31.222 --> 09:34.558
Now, that's lovely.
That's like a little bell.

09:34.725 --> 09:37.769
Why don't you go back to Tindolini?
It suits you.

09:37.937 --> 09:39.396
- You think so?
- Yes.

09:39.564 --> 09:44.192
So if and when you marry Maggie,
she'll be Maggie Tindolini.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.820
Do you get a kick out of that?

09:47.488 --> 09:49.781
What name do you act under?
Tindle or Tindolini?

09:49.949 --> 09:51.950
- Tindle.
- Why have I never heard of you?

09:52.118 --> 09:53.451
You will before long.

09:53.619 --> 09:55.495
- Really?
- In spades.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.330
- That sounds threatening.
- Does it?

09:57.498 --> 09:58.957
Doesn't it?

10:01.377 --> 10:04.588
Why don't we get down
to brass tacks?

10:04.755 --> 10:07.674
Brass tacks, yes. Why not?

10:09.010 --> 10:11.261
This is the way I see it.

10:12.847 --> 10:14.014
Come upstairs.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.017
I want to show you something.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.107
Are you all right in elevators?

10:27.069 --> 10:30.238
It won't make you sick
or anything, will it?

10:42.877 --> 10:45.295
This is our bedroom.

10:49.300 --> 10:55.555
And this is my wife's dressing room.

10:56.849 --> 11:00.060
She left a few dresses.
Couldn't be bothered to pick them up.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.563
They're worth thousands.
Thousands.

11:03.731 --> 11:07.400
This leather coat alone
is worth 5000 quid.

11:07.568 --> 11:11.196
So you see, the thing is this.
Sit down.

11:14.492 --> 11:16.951
The thing is this,
my wife spends money like water.

11:17.119 --> 11:21.498
So if you're not careful,
she'll eat you out of house and home.

11:21.666 --> 11:24.918
She was born to luxury, you know.
Jamaica, the Ritz, the Swiss Alps.

11:25.586 --> 11:28.922
What are you?
Out-of-work actor, part-time chauffeur.

11:29.090 --> 11:32.092
You're out of your depth, old boy.
You're on a hiding to nothing.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.927
If you think you're broke now ...

11:34.095 --> 11:37.305
you'll be 10 times broker
by the time she's finished with you.

11:37.473 --> 11:39.265
She'll have your guts for garters.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.853
- She's in love with me.
- Oh, never trust in love, chum.

11:44.021 --> 11:46.981
Love will kick you up the arse
as soon as look at you.

11:47.149 --> 11:50.694
One minute, it's love,
10 minutes later, it's contempt.

11:50.861 --> 11:52.487
That's your own experience, is it?

11:52.655 --> 11:55.448
Oh, no, no, no, that's observation.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.951
Don't forget, I'm a novelist.

11:58.119 --> 12:00.578
I observe people.

12:01.205 --> 12:04.416
What I'm getting at is you won't
be able to give her what she wants.

12:04.583 --> 12:07.460
So she's gonna leave you,
come back to me.

12:07.628 --> 12:10.171
I don't want her near me.
That's the last thing I want.

12:10.339 --> 12:12.173
I've had her up to here.

12:12.341 --> 12:16.553
Anyway, I've got this lovely mistress.
She runs a sauna in Swindon.

12:16.721 --> 12:17.804
She's my girl.

12:17.972 --> 12:20.932
So you see,
I want Maggie to stay with you.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.977
I want you two
to be together forever.

12:24.145 --> 12:25.520
But unless you listen to me ...

12:25.688 --> 12:27.897
the whole thing
will be a fucking disaster ...

12:28.065 --> 12:31.609
with catastrophic consequences
all round.

12:32.403 --> 12:37.073
But I have a solution.

12:40.953 --> 12:44.080
You won't believe
what I'm gonna say.

12:46.041 --> 12:48.126
What are you gonna say?

12:48.294 --> 12:50.754
I'm all ears.

12:50.921 --> 12:52.464
You know something?

12:52.631 --> 12:54.507
I'm beginning to respond
to your charm.

12:54.675 --> 12:56.176
- Get away.
- No, it's true.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.846
- I'm really touched.
- You should be.

13:00.014 --> 13:03.308
Tell me, I bet you didn't expect me
to be so intelligent.

13:03.476 --> 13:05.393
So quick-witted, did you?

13:05.561 --> 13:07.729
Oh, I did.

13:07.897 --> 13:09.773
Quite.

13:11.192 --> 13:13.651
Maggie told you, did she?

13:16.864 --> 13:18.990
What's your solution?

13:23.078 --> 13:25.622
It's a close fit, isn't it?

13:25.790 --> 13:27.624
For two.

13:35.758 --> 13:39.552
Listen, I'm going
to make you a proposition.

13:40.596 --> 13:42.972
A few years ago,
I gave her some jewels.

13:43.140 --> 13:45.475
Amazingly expensive.

13:45.643 --> 13:49.562
I didn't give them to her, I own them.
They're insured in my name.

13:49.730 --> 13:53.107
But I let her use them
on special occasions.

13:53.275 --> 13:56.152
They're worth 1 million pounds.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.531
They spend half the time in the bank,
half the time in the safe.

13:59.698 --> 14:04.577
At the moment, they're here
in the house, in the safe.

14:04.745 --> 14:08.832
And I want you to steal them.

14:13.045 --> 14:15.588
- Steal them?
- That's right.

14:16.131 --> 14:19.342
- What the hell do you mean?
- I want you to steal the jewels.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.928
You want me to steal the jewels?
I don't get it.

14:22.096 --> 14:24.764
It's simple. You steal the jewels,
sell them abroad ...

14:24.932 --> 14:27.725
and you live happily ever after
with Maggie.

14:27.893 --> 14:30.436
I get rid of my wife
and I'll be like a pig in shit.

14:30.604 --> 14:33.940
You can keep Maggie in the manner
to which she's become accustomed.

14:34.108 --> 14:37.443
You want me to take part
in a scummy little plot ...

14:37.611 --> 14:39.863
to defraud your insurance company,
is that it?

14:40.030 --> 14:41.614
I thought it was quite elegant.

14:41.782 --> 14:43.324
What do you think I am?

14:43.492 --> 14:46.077
What the fuck
are you actually talking about?

14:46.245 --> 14:48.663
- These are real facts.
- This is a joke.

14:48.831 --> 14:49.873
- No.
- It's also a trap.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.666
- A trap?
- Yes. You think I'm a fool.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.126
Well, are you?

14:53.294 --> 14:54.627
- It doesn't hold up.
- Why not?

14:54.795 --> 14:58.298
They're worth a million pounds. You'd
get a fraction of that from any fence.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.593
I have already contacted
a friend of mine in Amsterdam.

15:01.760 --> 15:07.348
And he will give you
800,000 pounds tax-free.

15:07.516 --> 15:09.559
Now, think about it.

15:09.727 --> 15:12.312
Eight hundred thousand pounds ...

15:12.479 --> 15:14.564
tax-free.

15:17.234 --> 15:18.484
Why would he do that?

15:18.652 --> 15:21.404
When you steal the jewels,
you will also steal the receipts.

15:21.572 --> 15:25.283
So he'll have title to the jewels
as well as the jewels themselves ...

15:25.451 --> 15:28.077
so that when he sells them,
he gets full value.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.374
Got it?

15:33.542 --> 15:35.335
Think about it.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.670
Take your time.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.483
And why would you do all this?

15:58.651 --> 16:03.363
Listen, under this crooked exterior,
I am a simple, honest man.

16:03.530 --> 16:07.200
Every word I've told you is true,
I swear it.

16:07.368 --> 16:12.872
I want to get rid of my wife,
but I want it to be solid, permanent.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.042
I don't want her on my back.
I want her to stay on your back.

16:16.210 --> 16:17.710
This is a frame-up.

16:17.878 --> 16:20.213
- A frame-up?
- Yes.

16:20.381 --> 16:22.966
You want to destroy me.

16:23.133 --> 16:24.384
You want to see me in jail.

16:24.551 --> 16:28.054
You want me to do this
and then shop me to the police.

16:28.222 --> 16:29.472
No, no, no.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.977
If I shop you, then you'll shop me,
and then we'll both end up in jail.

16:34.144 --> 16:36.604
No, I take a strictly moral position
on all this.

16:36.772 --> 16:38.815
My wife is an adulteress.

16:38.983 --> 16:41.275
Actually,
she should be stoned to death.

16:41.443 --> 16:44.237
Anyway, it's up to you.
Make up your own mind.

16:44.405 --> 16:45.780
You're asking me to trust you?

16:45.948 --> 16:47.907
I don't give a fuck
if you trust me or not.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.701
This is a simple proposition.

16:49.868 --> 16:52.495
You have an expensive woman
and no money.

16:52.663 --> 16:55.748
You wanna keep the woman,
steal the jewels.

16:55.916 --> 16:59.752
Why don't you steal the jewels
and give them to me?

16:59.920 --> 17:01.546
Don't be a bloody fool.

17:01.714 --> 17:05.133
The burglary has to be right.
The house has to be broken into.

17:05.300 --> 17:08.094
- Why don't you break into it?
- For chrissake, I'm in it.

17:08.262 --> 17:11.055
How can I break into it? I live here.

17:39.043 --> 17:40.084
Okay.

17:40.252 --> 17:46.132
If I were to agree to do this,
would you agree to the divorce?

17:46.300 --> 17:47.967
Why should I give her the divorce ...

17:48.135 --> 17:50.553
if you're both walking away
with 800,000 pounds?

17:50.721 --> 17:52.889
She wants a legal settlement.

17:53.557 --> 17:55.558
- She wants part of your estate.
- Greedy.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.477
That's legal justice.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.896
Never trust in legal justice.

18:00.064 --> 18:01.939
You know what legal justice is?

18:02.107 --> 18:06.110
It's farting "Annie Laurie"
through a keyhole.

18:07.738 --> 18:11.824
Listen, 800,000 pounds ...

18:11.992 --> 18:13.201
tax-free.

18:13.368 --> 18:15.369
All yours, in cash.

18:15.537 --> 18:19.332
- Why don't you stop pissing around?
- But wait a minute.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.460
You get a million
from the insurance.

18:22.628 --> 18:24.128
Sure I do.

18:24.296 --> 18:27.006
Well, all right, I'll be frank.

18:27.174 --> 18:30.927
I need it. Cash flow,
stocks, shares going down.

18:31.095 --> 18:33.846
Get me? Quid pro quo.

18:34.014 --> 18:37.850
You do me a favor, I do you a favor,
you keep the woman.

18:40.270 --> 18:41.938
Okay.

18:42.898 --> 18:44.357
Let's make a deal.

18:44.525 --> 18:47.443
- What deal?
- I break in, I steal the jewels.

18:47.611 --> 18:51.614
And you agree to the divorce.

18:52.282 --> 18:56.661
That's the deal. Otherwise, fuck it.
That's another quid pro quo.

18:56.829 --> 18:59.038
But you have to shake on it.

19:00.749 --> 19:02.416
All right.

19:03.043 --> 19:04.669
I'll shake on it.

19:04.837 --> 19:06.712
Here's my hand.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.882
Okay.

19:12.302 --> 19:15.221
Okay. So, what do I do?

19:15.389 --> 19:17.557
You break in.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.350
You see that skylight up there?

19:19.518 --> 19:23.896
Well, that window there is the only one
that the burglar alarm doesn't touch.

19:24.064 --> 19:25.064
You get in there.

19:25.232 --> 19:28.734
- That's pretty high up.
- Well, you climb a ladder.

19:28.902 --> 19:30.862
- I'm not good at heights.
- You can do it.

19:31.029 --> 19:33.030
Honestly, I know you can.

19:33.198 --> 19:35.992
- You're having me on.
- Oh, come on. Behave like a man.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.493
A man of action.

19:37.661 --> 19:40.454
You don't have to be a hairdresser
for the rest of your life.

19:40.622 --> 19:45.042
You can be free, independent,
take care of the woman you love.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.752
Listen ...

19:47.337 --> 19:48.754
Put this on.

19:48.922 --> 19:51.465
I use it to communicate
with my gardener.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.598
Lovely. Actually, it suits you.

20:00.225 --> 20:02.727
This is what you do. You go outside.

20:02.895 --> 20:05.938
Across the lawn, there's a shed.
Behind the shed, there's a ladder.

20:06.106 --> 20:09.025
You take the ladder, put it up
against the wall of the house...

20:09.193 --> 20:12.737
and I direct you
through the earphone.

20:12.905 --> 20:16.240
- Are you with me?
- Well, yes, yes.

20:16.408 --> 20:18.910
- But I'm anxious and frightened.
- Trust me.

20:19.077 --> 20:21.704
- But I don't.
- Well, trust me and all will be well.

20:21.872 --> 20:25.666
Just follow my advice.
It's got to look real.

20:25.834 --> 20:27.960
We have to convince
the insurance people ...

20:28.128 --> 20:30.338
and the police,
if you see what I mean.

20:30.505 --> 20:35.176
Maggie never told me
you were such a manipulator.

20:35.344 --> 20:36.969
She told me
you were no good in bed.

20:37.137 --> 20:39.222
But she never told me
you were a manipulator.

20:39.389 --> 20:42.600
- She told you I was no good in bed?
- Oh, yes.

20:42.768 --> 20:46.437
She was joking.
I'm wonderful in bed.

20:46.605 --> 20:48.648
I must tell her.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.453
- There's the shed across the lawn.
- Shed, yeah.

21:02.996 --> 21:06.707
- There's the ladder behind the shed.
- The ladder?

21:07.459 --> 21:09.210
The ladder.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.256
Inside the shed,
there's a pair of gardening gloves.

21:13.423 --> 21:16.008
Put them on. By the gardening gloves,
there's a hammer.

21:16.176 --> 21:17.802
You go round the back of the house.

21:17.970 --> 21:20.471
Put the ladder up against the wall
by the lower roof.

21:20.639 --> 21:23.849
Then, carry the hammer up the ladder
on to the lower roof.

21:24.017 --> 21:26.352
Then, you pull the ladder up
on to the main roof ...

21:26.520 --> 21:29.272
and break the skylight window
with the hammer.

21:34.528 --> 21:38.239
Wait a minute.
You've forgotten one major item.

21:38.407 --> 21:40.366
What?

21:40.534 --> 21:43.160
Once I'm in,
how do I get down to floor level?

21:43.328 --> 21:45.663
Didn't I tell you? Oh, sorry.

21:45.831 --> 21:47.832
You see that small metal door
up there?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.792
Inside, there's an electric ladder.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.545
You get through the window,
I press a button.

21:52.713 --> 21:54.005
The ladder descends.

21:54.172 --> 21:56.507
- You get on and climb down.
- Let me see it descend.

21:56.675 --> 21:58.676
- What?
- Let me see it come down now.

21:58.844 --> 22:00.386
Sure.

22:15.861 --> 22:18.904
See? Easy as pissing.

22:22.993 --> 22:26.746
- I have a funny feeling that I'm a cunt.
- Of course you're a cunt.

22:27.873 --> 22:30.875
But so what?
You'll end up a wealthy man.

22:31.043 --> 22:33.794
Obey the rules. Just obey the rules.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.590
- Whose rules?
- My rules.

22:39.801 --> 22:41.969
Go and get the other ladder.

23:11.291 --> 23:12.792
Can you see the ladder?

23:16.755 --> 23:18.464
Can I see the ladder?

23:31.436 --> 23:34.230
Place the ladder against the wall.

23:34.398 --> 23:36.482
Okay.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.403
Extend the ladder.

23:40.570 --> 23:41.821
Okay.

23:45.951 --> 23:48.077
- Climb up the ladder.
- Okay!

23:53.959 --> 23:55.501
Climb up the ladder.

23:56.753 --> 23:58.504
Why am I doing this?

24:12.602 --> 24:15.521
Keep calm. Keep calm.

24:15.689 --> 24:18.482
Keep coming. Keep coming.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.443
- Watch your step.
- Jesus.

24:27.742 --> 24:29.869
Keep calm.

25:11.453 --> 25:14.246
- Watch your step.
- I'm gonna die.

25:15.832 --> 25:17.917
Fuck.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.169
Don't stop. Keep going.

25:21.379 --> 25:22.922
Don't look down.

25:25.008 --> 25:26.550
You're at the window.

25:27.677 --> 25:29.386
Smash it.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.773
Fantastic.

25:43.235 --> 25:44.902
- Where's the ladder?
- What ladder?

25:45.070 --> 25:46.779
The ladder. Where's it gone?

25:46.947 --> 25:49.949
It's not working. There was
always a dodgy fuse on this.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.076
I'll phone the electrician
in the morning.

25:52.244 --> 25:53.869
In the morning? What about now?

25:54.037 --> 25:56.455
No, he'll be in bed.
You know these country people.

25:56.623 --> 26:00.793
Early to bed, early to rise.
He's a nice chap. He's called Norman.

26:00.961 --> 26:03.629
Charming wife, Debbie.
Three delightful kids.

26:03.797 --> 26:06.340
Oh, I've just remembered.
He's on vacation.

26:06.508 --> 26:09.134
- He's taken the kids to Bermuda.
- What?

26:09.302 --> 26:12.096
So I'm stuck up here
for the rest of my life?

26:12.264 --> 26:15.432
Have patience.
Stoicism is what's called for.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.977
Works wonders. Oh, wait a minute.

26:18.562 --> 26:21.564
There's an emergency button
on the wall. You see it?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.233
That's it. Just press it ...

26:24.401 --> 26:26.694
and all will be well.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.614
There it is.

26:37.622 --> 26:39.623
Careful. Be careful.

26:42.043 --> 26:43.335
That's it.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.339
- Careful.
- Is this as far as it will go?

26:47.507 --> 26:48.924
Jump.

26:51.303 --> 26:53.679
- Oh, Christ!
- Wonderful.

26:54.472 --> 26:57.516
- Very, very impressed.
- I thought I was gonna die.

26:57.684 --> 27:00.019
- You will.
- So, what the fuck do I do now?

27:00.186 --> 27:02.771
- You open the safe.
- Where is it? How do I open it?

27:02.939 --> 27:05.149
Wait a minute.
You don't know where it is.

27:05.317 --> 27:07.568
You've got to find it,
you've got to look for it.

27:07.736 --> 27:10.988
Where is it?
Start in the bedroom.

27:11.156 --> 27:13.157
- How are you feeling?
- Okay, all right.

27:13.325 --> 27:15.909
- Excited?
- Quite, yes.

27:16.077 --> 27:19.038
You're a cool customer, I like that.
Okay.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.206
Open the wardrobe.
Open the drawers.

27:21.374 --> 27:22.416
Throw things around.

27:22.584 --> 27:25.294
You're looking for the safe.
It's up here somewhere.

27:25.462 --> 27:28.672
Play it for real.
Kick the place to death.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.341
You're a desperate man.

27:31.051 --> 27:33.761
Safes are always kept
behind paintings, aren't they?

27:33.928 --> 27:35.220
What are you doing?

27:35.388 --> 27:37.890
I'm a desperate man, aren't I?
That's what you said.

27:38.058 --> 27:40.059
The man is a barbarian.

27:40.226 --> 27:44.229
- Where's the fucking safe?
- Well, open the chest of drawers.

27:45.690 --> 27:47.232
- It's locked.
- Kick it to death.

27:52.656 --> 27:55.032
And this is where I hear you.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.533
You hear me?

27:56.701 --> 28:01.205
Yes, I'm asleep in the study.
That's where I sleep these days.

28:01.373 --> 28:04.416
I can't sleep in the bed
without my wife, you see.

28:05.794 --> 28:08.587
I hear you, I come into the bedroom.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.714
And I find you.

28:10.882 --> 28:11.924
And then?

28:12.092 --> 28:14.093
- I attack you.
- How?

28:14.260 --> 28:17.262
Like this. And this.

28:21.393 --> 28:24.645
- That hurt.
- So sorry.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.775
Then, you get out your knife.

28:30.402 --> 28:32.361
I don't have a knife.

28:34.948 --> 28:36.407
I do.

28:36.574 --> 28:39.076
- You threaten me with it.
- You're threatening me.

28:39.244 --> 28:41.120
No, I'm playing you.
This is what you do.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.288
You want to know
where the safe is ...

28:43.456 --> 28:46.959
what the combination is,
so you terrorize me with this knife.

28:47.127 --> 28:48.961
- Take it easy.
- You can see I'm ruthless.

28:49.129 --> 28:51.046
I'm unpredictable.
I'm probably a killer.

28:51.214 --> 28:55.342
And I'm certainly
very, very dangerous.

28:55.510 --> 28:58.387
But you? You're obstinate.

28:58.555 --> 29:01.765
- Me or you?
- I'm you, you're me, you get it?

29:02.225 --> 29:06.478
Now, the jewels
are worth a lot of money.

29:06.646 --> 29:07.980
You won't give in ...

29:08.148 --> 29:13.485
but I get out my gun.

29:15.655 --> 29:17.072
I'm still you, by the way.

29:18.450 --> 29:22.327
But then, to make it clear
that I mean business ...

29:24.831 --> 29:28.917
Bull's-eye.

29:30.003 --> 29:32.838
Finally, you give in.
You're so terrified ...

29:33.006 --> 29:38.010
you show me where the safe is.
It is behind that.

29:38.178 --> 29:39.178
Magic.

29:39.345 --> 29:42.514
And you're so frightened,
you give me the combination.

29:42.682 --> 29:46.685
19-11-94. Open it.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.645
Wait a minute. Am I me now?

29:48.813 --> 29:51.231
- Or are you me?
- No, you're now you.

29:51.399 --> 29:52.608
- You're now you.
- Me?

29:52.776 --> 29:55.194
- No, no.
- Or are you still me?

29:55.361 --> 29:59.281
You're now you. And I'm now me.

30:00.492 --> 30:01.950
Open the safe.

30:02.118 --> 30:04.328
19-11-94.

30:06.039 --> 30:07.372
It was our wedding day.

30:08.833 --> 30:13.879
The 19th of November, 1994.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.391
Jesus.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.316
What do you think?

30:35.902 --> 30:39.905
They're quite beautiful.

30:40.073 --> 30:42.241
Put them in your pocket.

30:43.952 --> 30:46.662
Eight hundred
thousand pounds, eh?

30:47.747 --> 30:49.748
That's what I said.

30:55.171 --> 30:56.755
Okay.

31:00.009 --> 31:02.761
So far, so good.

31:02.929 --> 31:05.597
Hey, you'd better give me
the address of that fence.

31:05.765 --> 31:07.933
- What fence?
- The fence in Amsterdam.

31:08.101 --> 31:09.434
Oh, that fence.

31:09.894 --> 31:12.729
Listen, you put that gun down.

31:12.897 --> 31:14.273
Why?

31:15.859 --> 31:19.236
It's pointing directly at me.
I'm not very happy about it.

31:19.404 --> 31:20.988
Why not?

31:22.240 --> 31:25.409
- Look, is this a game?
- This is the real game.

31:28.162 --> 31:31.623
The real game has just begun.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.501
What's the real game?

31:34.669 --> 31:36.795
You and me.

31:37.297 --> 31:40.632
You, defenseless. Me, with a gun.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.595
It's the end of the jewelry story,
you see.

31:46.431 --> 31:47.973
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

31:48.141 --> 31:50.309
I enjoyed it, though.

31:50.727 --> 31:51.768
I'm not enjoying this.

31:51.936 --> 31:53.312
I don't blame you.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.107
What's it all about?

31:57.275 --> 32:01.403
Oh, come on. Buck your ideas up.

32:01.821 --> 32:05.782
You really didn't think I was gonna
let you have my wife and the jewels?

32:08.286 --> 32:10.203
You're joking.

32:11.789 --> 32:13.665
You've been leading me
up the garden.

32:13.833 --> 32:15.292
Right up.

32:16.628 --> 32:18.587
Stand on the bed.

32:30.934 --> 32:32.684
Listen. Wait a minute.

32:32.852 --> 32:36.772
Before you do anything,
there's something I must tell you.

32:38.274 --> 32:40.859
- What?
- Maggie respects you.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.361
- Really?
- Yes.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.738
She often says
you're a man of true integrity ...

32:44.906 --> 32:46.990
that you're a really decent guy.

32:47.158 --> 32:49.868
She's right. I'm a really decent guy.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.620
- I believe it.
- She's quite right.

32:51.788 --> 32:53.830
I'm a really decent guy.

32:53.998 --> 32:55.457
I know you are. I know you are.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.668
And that's what she often says.

32:57.835 --> 32:59.711
You're -- She admires your mind.

32:59.879 --> 33:02.047
- She admires my mind?
- Yes.

33:02.215 --> 33:04.383
- Your mind excites her.
- Sexually?

33:04.550 --> 33:06.885
Very. Your mind
excites your wife sexually.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.137
- What about my body?
- What about it?

33:09.305 --> 33:12.140
Well, what does she say
about my body?

33:14.143 --> 33:17.062
Do you know,
I don't think she's ever mentioned it.

33:17.230 --> 33:19.147
You're a prick.

33:22.151 --> 33:24.736
- Where does my prick come into it?
- I can guess where it comes in.

33:24.904 --> 33:27.572
But I wasn't talking
about your prick.

33:27.824 --> 33:31.243
- I was calling you a prick.
- Oh, thanks.

33:31.411 --> 33:33.245
But you know
what you are now, though?

33:33.413 --> 33:34.579
What?

33:34.747 --> 33:37.165
- You're a dead duck.
- Really?

33:37.583 --> 33:40.836
This is the way
the story goes to the police.

33:41.004 --> 33:43.922
I find you in my house,
you threaten me.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.882
You open the safe,
you take the jewels.

33:46.050 --> 33:47.426
You put them in your pocket.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.846
I manage to grab the gun
while you're looking at the jewels.

33:51.014 --> 33:53.390
There's a struggle.
The gun goes off.

33:53.891 --> 33:56.018
Suddenly, I realize you're dead.

33:56.185 --> 33:58.103
You're gonna shoot me.

33:58.271 --> 34:00.022
- What do you think?
- Why?

34:00.189 --> 34:03.775
I planned all this from the word go.

34:03.943 --> 34:09.864
I've always longed for
an intimate chat with a hairdresser.

34:10.033 --> 34:14.578
Especially a hairdresser
who is fucking my wife.

34:14.746 --> 34:16.121
I'm not a hairdresser!

34:16.289 --> 34:20.125
My wife is mine! She belongs to me!

34:20.293 --> 34:23.712
And I'm her husband!

34:24.714 --> 34:28.050
And what you've done is this.

34:29.552 --> 34:34.473
You've invited yourself
to attend your own death.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.309
Please.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.268
No, don't do it.
Please don't shoot me.

34:39.437 --> 34:43.982
Please don't shoot me, please!
I'll just get in my car and go, okay?

34:44.150 --> 34:46.150
That's all.
You'll never see me again.

34:46.652 --> 34:47.735
You're crazy.

34:47.904 --> 34:50.322
No, you're not crazy.
You just got things wrong.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.491
I don't want your wife. I hate women.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.659
You hear me?
I hate women. I hate your wife!

34:54.827 --> 34:57.579
You've absolutely
no reason to be jealous.

34:58.331 --> 35:01.833
Women are not my scene.
I'd rather do it with a dog or a goat.

35:02.001 --> 35:05.253
Or a boy I knew at school.
His name was Dooley.

35:05.421 --> 35:07.839
I called him Dolores.
I hate women!

35:08.341 --> 35:11.343
Honest. God's honor.

35:11.511 --> 35:13.011
Do you believe in God?

37:53.172 --> 37:54.589
Just shut up.

37:57.385 --> 38:00.303
I'm asking the questions, not you.

38:01.055 --> 38:04.474
- How long have you known him?
- I don't know him. I've never met him.

38:08.229 --> 38:10.563
What are you? A joker?

38:56.736 --> 38:58.236
Yes?

39:00.072 --> 39:01.865
Andrew Wyke?

39:02.033 --> 39:03.575
Yes.

39:03.743 --> 39:06.036
Detective Inspector Black.

39:06.203 --> 39:08.955
New Scotland Yard. Eddie Black.

39:10.750 --> 39:12.667
I'd like a word with you.

39:13.210 --> 39:14.627
A word?

39:14.795 --> 39:16.421
That's right.

39:17.214 --> 39:18.923
What about?

39:21.719 --> 39:23.428
Can I come in?

39:24.847 --> 39:27.140
Yes. Yes, of course.

39:29.101 --> 39:30.143
Like a drink?

39:30.311 --> 39:32.312
Got any beer?

39:32.855 --> 39:35.357
Beer? Yes.

39:35.524 --> 39:36.900
You're the writer.

39:37.777 --> 39:39.986
You write crime books.

39:40.154 --> 39:42.238
That's right.

39:42.406 --> 39:44.616
I've read a couple.

39:45.117 --> 39:47.077
Right on the button.

39:47.244 --> 39:49.579
Oh, that's a great compliment.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.708
How do you know so much about it?

39:53.876 --> 39:55.126
What?

39:55.294 --> 39:56.878
Villainy.

39:57.046 --> 39:59.339
Crime. Horror.

40:01.092 --> 40:06.012
Imagination.

40:06.180 --> 40:07.472
Clever.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.599
I do my best.

40:10.643 --> 40:12.811
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:18.484 --> 40:21.444
I see you got
a broken window up there.

40:23.239 --> 40:25.407
Tropical storm the other night.

40:25.574 --> 40:27.951
Bit of a hurricane, terrifying.

40:28.119 --> 40:30.954
A great branch broke off a big tree ...

40:31.122 --> 40:33.665
and flew through the air
through the skylight ...

40:34.166 --> 40:36.126
as you can see.

40:36.293 --> 40:37.585
Act of God.

40:37.753 --> 40:39.462
Had it in for you, did he?

40:39.630 --> 40:41.506
- Who?
- God.

40:41.674 --> 40:43.883
Oh, yes, he's always been
a vicious bastard.

40:44.051 --> 40:45.510
You know what God's trouble is?

40:45.678 --> 40:47.637
- What?
- He has no father.

40:47.805 --> 40:51.224
He has no family roots.
He's rootless.

40:51.392 --> 40:55.103
Nowhere to hang his hat,
poor bugger. I pity him.

40:55.271 --> 40:58.398
That's a very interesting
philosophical speculation.

40:58.566 --> 41:01.359
Wait a minute.
Aren't you a well-known detective?

41:01.527 --> 41:03.445
No.

41:03.612 --> 41:07.699
Not me, mate.
You're thinking of another bloke.

41:08.367 --> 41:11.536
Haven't I seen your picture
in the newspaper?

41:13.164 --> 41:15.540
Do you want to know
my opinion of the newspapers?

41:15.708 --> 41:17.292
What?

41:18.919 --> 41:22.338
Journalists are a bunch
of prick-teasing cocksuckers.

41:22.756 --> 41:23.965
No.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.383
That's right.

41:25.551 --> 41:28.678
I'm sorry, but isn't that
a contradiction in terms?

41:28.846 --> 41:30.555
Is it?

41:32.892 --> 41:34.142
So you're not well-known?

41:34.310 --> 41:36.394
No, I'm a common-or-garden copper.

41:36.562 --> 41:40.231
I just catch sex criminals, perverts ...

41:40.399 --> 41:41.858
homicidal maniacs.

41:42.026 --> 41:45.361
And what do you do with them
when you catch them?

41:45.529 --> 41:48.239
I generally cut their balls off.

41:49.825 --> 41:51.618
I see.

41:59.502 --> 42:02.879
So how can I help you?

42:03.047 --> 42:05.507
Yes, I think you can help me.
I think you can.

42:05.674 --> 42:07.050
How?

42:07.218 --> 42:08.927
I'm looking into a disappearance.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.094
Disappearance?

42:10.262 --> 42:13.556
Man called Tindle. Milo Tindle.

42:13.724 --> 42:17.310
Sorry, I didn't get the name.
What was it?

42:17.478 --> 42:19.103
Tindle.

42:20.022 --> 42:22.565
Tindle. Tindle ...

42:23.817 --> 42:25.443
What about him?

42:25.611 --> 42:26.986
Do you know him?

42:27.154 --> 42:29.614
Know him? Absolutely not.

42:29.782 --> 42:31.574
- You mean you've never met him?
- Never.

42:31.742 --> 42:33.117
Never even heard of him.

42:33.285 --> 42:34.953
- That's funny.
- Why?

42:35.120 --> 42:37.914
Well, he was staying
at the Red Lion in the village ...

42:38.082 --> 42:39.916
where he mentioned
to the landlord ...

42:40.084 --> 42:42.126
he was coming to see you
three nights ago.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.503
He hasn't been seen since.

42:43.671 --> 42:46.464
His bag is still in his room,
shaving kit, all that.

42:46.632 --> 42:47.757
He was coming to see me?

42:47.925 --> 42:49.634
That's right.

42:49.802 --> 42:51.261
He mentioned it to the landlord?

42:51.428 --> 42:53.763
Why would he mention such a thing
to the landlord?

42:53.931 --> 42:57.100
Well, you're a famous writer
and you're well known in the district.

42:57.268 --> 42:58.977
So how can you help me on this?

42:59.144 --> 43:01.521
No one came to see me.
I've no idea who this man is.

43:01.689 --> 43:05.233
And I know no one called Tindle.

43:05.401 --> 43:07.277
You don't, eh?

43:15.744 --> 43:17.996
What are you? A joker?

43:18.163 --> 43:19.664
What do you mean?

43:19.832 --> 43:22.500
I mean you're pretty quick
on your feet.

43:22.668 --> 43:25.712
You should have been
a ballet dancer.

43:25.879 --> 43:29.173
I can just see you doing pirouettes.

43:30.217 --> 43:33.261
- Ever worn a pair of tights?
- Not me.

43:36.223 --> 43:38.016
They'd suit you.

43:39.643 --> 43:40.852
Nice house.

43:41.020 --> 43:42.520
Thanks.

43:43.439 --> 43:45.898
- Design it yourself?
- It's 18th-century.

43:46.066 --> 43:49.152
No, no, I meant this. The inside.

43:49.320 --> 43:50.361
That was my wife.

43:50.529 --> 43:52.905
Oh, your wife.
Is she here, by the way?

43:53.073 --> 43:54.157
No.

43:54.325 --> 43:55.867
Popped up to London?

43:56.035 --> 43:57.577
She's not here.

43:57.745 --> 44:00.496
She's an interior decorator, then?

44:00.664 --> 44:02.206
Something like that.

44:04.710 --> 44:07.045
It's a great gift, isn't it?

44:08.422 --> 44:10.590
You're a lucky man.

44:12.217 --> 44:14.135
You got an ashtray?

44:20.351 --> 44:22.560
I'm ready for another beer.

44:28.817 --> 44:30.985
A man was passing your house
three nights ago.

44:31.153 --> 44:33.404
He said he heard shots.

44:33.572 --> 44:35.198
Passed my house?

44:35.366 --> 44:38.701
How could he do that?
It's private property.

44:38.869 --> 44:41.287
He were taking a shortcut.

44:41.455 --> 44:42.830
I think he's a poacher.

44:42.998 --> 44:45.458
Anyway, says he heard shots.

44:45.626 --> 44:47.460
What kind of shots?

44:47.628 --> 44:48.670
Gunshots.

44:48.837 --> 44:50.588
- Fantasy.
- Really?

44:50.756 --> 44:52.924
Bullshit. Codswallop.

44:53.092 --> 44:55.885
Who is this man?
Are you sure he exists?

44:56.053 --> 44:58.346
Oh, he exists, all right.

44:58.514 --> 44:59.681
By the way, cheers.

44:59.848 --> 45:01.432
Cheers.

45:05.854 --> 45:08.439
I do want to ask you
one more question.

45:17.616 --> 45:19.033
Ask.

45:19.201 --> 45:21.953
You do know your wife's
living in London with another man?

45:24.164 --> 45:26.124
That is my business.

45:26.291 --> 45:29.085
My private life is my business.

45:29.253 --> 45:30.795
Do you know the name of this man?

45:30.963 --> 45:33.464
Why should I answer
these questions?

45:35.300 --> 45:38.302
You don't have to,
but you'd be better off if you did.

45:42.891 --> 45:45.393
I don't know the man's name.

45:45.811 --> 45:47.645
I never asked.

45:49.565 --> 45:53.651
So you do admit that your wife's
living in London with another man?

45:55.320 --> 45:58.156
Yes. Yes.

45:58.323 --> 45:59.991
So what?

46:01.910 --> 46:06.330
Well, I can tell you the man's name.

46:12.004 --> 46:14.046
It's Tindle.

46:14.631 --> 46:16.090
Milo Tindle.

46:21.096 --> 46:23.514
- Is it?
- Yeah.

46:24.683 --> 46:27.018
The bloke who's disappeared.

46:27.186 --> 46:30.188
The bloke who said
he was coming to see you.

46:30.355 --> 46:33.691
We found this note in his room.

46:33.859 --> 46:35.693
At the pub.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.988
"I look forward to meeting you.

46:39.156 --> 46:42.325
Come to the house Friday, 6:30.

46:42.534 --> 46:44.202
Wyke."

46:44.745 --> 46:47.121
Is this your handwriting?

46:48.373 --> 46:52.084
- It is.
- Do you remember writing this note?

46:52.669 --> 46:54.045
How could I forget?

46:54.213 --> 46:56.255
You forgot earlier.

46:56.423 --> 46:59.133
You said you didn't know him.

46:59.301 --> 47:01.969
You said you'd never met him.

47:21.073 --> 47:22.573
I was lying.

47:28.413 --> 47:30.832
Lying to the police.

47:31.875 --> 47:34.126
That will get you nowhere.

47:38.090 --> 47:40.299
I don't understand you,
mate, honest.

47:40.467 --> 47:43.427
You're a clever man.
You write clever books.

47:43.595 --> 47:45.972
But you've made a balls-up
of this one, haven't you?

47:46.431 --> 47:47.682
Have I?

47:47.850 --> 47:51.185
Tindle came to see you
three nights ago.

47:51.353 --> 47:53.771
- I knew him as Tindolini.
- Oh, I see.

47:53.939 --> 47:55.773
- He had an Italian father.
- Get away.

47:55.941 --> 47:58.609
A traditional
Italian hairdressing family.

47:58.777 --> 48:02.238
- Is he a hairdresser himself?
- I think he is.

48:02.406 --> 48:05.074
He didn't come all the way here
to do your hair, did he?

48:05.242 --> 48:07.493
Not at all, not at all.

48:08.620 --> 48:12.456
So, what did you two do
when you got together?

48:15.252 --> 48:16.711
We played a game.

48:17.087 --> 48:19.922
- A game?
- A game with a knife and a gun.

48:20.090 --> 48:21.632
- A lethal game?
- No.

48:22.092 --> 48:23.718
Just a bit of fun, that's all.

48:23.886 --> 48:26.304
Okay, a bit of fun.

48:26.471 --> 48:28.306
So he came to see you.

48:28.473 --> 48:31.976
You played a game
with a knife and a gun.

48:32.144 --> 48:35.229
Three shots were fired,
then he disappeared.

48:35.397 --> 48:36.606
So where is he?

48:36.773 --> 48:39.817
- Probably cuddling my wife.
- That's the one thing he's not doing.

48:40.235 --> 48:41.736
- How do you know?
- I've seen her.

48:41.904 --> 48:43.154
He was nowhere in sight.

48:45.449 --> 48:47.658
No. She's an anxious woman.

48:48.327 --> 48:50.745
She knew he was coming
to see you, you see.

48:50.913 --> 48:54.457
In fact, she insisted
that he come to see you ...

48:54.625 --> 48:56.584
as I know you know.

48:59.421 --> 49:02.006
She thinks you may have killed him.

49:02.507 --> 49:05.593
She thinks you're round the bend.

49:06.470 --> 49:08.679
She thinks
you're a very dangerous man.

49:08.847 --> 49:10.181
Me? She's joking.

49:11.975 --> 49:14.810
So tell me, between ourselves ...

49:15.312 --> 49:17.104
did you kill him?

49:19.399 --> 49:21.859
I'll tell you exactly what I did.

49:22.027 --> 49:24.278
I pretended to kill him.

49:24.446 --> 49:28.532
I shot him with a blank.
I frightened the shit out of him.

49:29.076 --> 49:32.244
Your man was right.
Your spy, whoever he was.

49:32.412 --> 49:33.955
There were three shots.

49:34.122 --> 49:37.208
The first two were real.
The third one was blank.

49:38.418 --> 49:42.046
He was terrified.
When I shot him, he fainted.

49:42.214 --> 49:44.840
When he came round
I gave him a drink, pat on the bum ...

49:45.467 --> 49:49.720
he left the house, his tail, if you
want to call it that, between his legs.

49:49.888 --> 49:51.514
And I haven't seen him since.

49:51.682 --> 49:54.308
You gave him a pat on the bum?

49:54.476 --> 49:55.726
Metaphorically.

49:55.894 --> 49:58.896
You gave him
a metaphorical pat on the bum?

49:59.064 --> 50:00.815
- Sure.
- How did he take it?

50:00.983 --> 50:02.858
- What?
- The pat.

50:03.402 --> 50:07.863
He was fine. He told me that
it was game, set and match to me.

50:08.699 --> 50:11.701
So this guy had a sense of humor,
is that what you're saying?

50:11.868 --> 50:14.704
Oh, yes. He left the house
with a twinkle in his eye.

50:14.871 --> 50:18.040
So tell me,
what was the point of all this?

50:18.208 --> 50:19.250
Humiliation.

50:19.418 --> 50:21.168
It's nice to see your wife's lover ...

50:21.336 --> 50:24.213
a shivering, frightened,
fucking wreck in front of you.

50:24.381 --> 50:26.215
As a matter of fact, I liked him.

50:26.675 --> 50:28.092
I thought he was attractive.

50:28.260 --> 50:30.261
I thought we could have
become good friends.

50:30.762 --> 50:35.599
The shortest way to a man's heart,
as I'm sure you know, is humiliation.

50:35.767 --> 50:38.227
It binds you together.

50:40.689 --> 50:43.482
You found him attractive?

50:43.650 --> 50:47.486
I put myself in my wife's shoes,
in a manner of speaking.

50:47.654 --> 50:51.407
I was trying to find out
what attracted her to him.

50:53.493 --> 50:55.327
- And did you?
- Oh, yes.

50:55.495 --> 50:58.330
He was really terribly sweet.

50:58.498 --> 51:01.959
- I could see why she fancied him.
- I could see why he fancies her.

51:03.462 --> 51:05.588
- Really?
- Found her very tasty myself.

51:06.256 --> 51:08.507
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

51:08.675 --> 51:11.135
Sumptuous. Ready for action.

51:13.096 --> 51:15.890
I mean,
I'm an experienced detective.

51:16.058 --> 51:19.101
So guess what I detected.

51:19.269 --> 51:20.478
What?

51:20.645 --> 51:24.023
That she's in love
with her own body.

51:24.191 --> 51:26.901
Makes her dizzy with excitement.

51:30.655 --> 51:32.573
You detected all this
in five minutes?

51:32.741 --> 51:35.493
Well, 35. Perhaps even 45.

51:35.660 --> 51:39.497
Well, let's call it 55
or even a little bit longer.

51:39.998 --> 51:40.998
You stayed for tea?

51:41.166 --> 51:43.167
And cakes.

51:44.461 --> 51:52.009
Yeah.

51:52.177 --> 51:53.844
Must be funny for you to know ...

51:54.012 --> 51:57.723
your own wife's getting a going-over
from another man on a regular basis.

51:57.891 --> 51:59.350
Going-over? I don't follow.

51:59.518 --> 52:00.851
You don't?

52:01.019 --> 52:02.561
Not a phrase I'm familiar with.

52:02.729 --> 52:06.107
- Means being fucked.
- You mean like in sexual intercourse?

52:06.274 --> 52:09.652
Yes, the old one-two.
In like a lion, out like a lamb.

52:09.820 --> 52:12.446
I must say, you have
a great gift for language.

52:12.614 --> 52:13.864
Did you learn it at school?

52:14.032 --> 52:15.866
The hard school. Family life.

52:16.034 --> 52:18.786
- But you keep cheerful.
- You've got it, I keep cheerful.

52:18.954 --> 52:21.455
I've got an optimistic nature.

52:21.623 --> 52:24.166
You got to when you're a policeman.
Otherwise, you'd go mad.

52:24.334 --> 52:27.711
No, I'll tell you
what keeps me going.

52:29.381 --> 52:33.050
The chase. The thrill of the hunt
and the sudden shafts of bright light.

52:33.718 --> 52:38.639
For instance,
when I was talking to your wife ...

52:39.516 --> 52:41.934
Very attractive woman.

52:43.562 --> 52:45.729
Wonderful legs.

52:49.359 --> 52:52.069
She was crossing them at the time,
I remember.

52:52.237 --> 52:57.825
She suddenly said
you had a murderous nature.

53:00.036 --> 53:02.580
Now, that really
made my nose twitch.

53:02.747 --> 53:04.331
Itch?

53:05.917 --> 53:08.627
Twitch, mate.

53:09.087 --> 53:10.838
Twitch.

53:11.423 --> 53:14.300
So I'm looking at you
and I'm wondering ...

53:14.467 --> 53:16.760
what have you done
with the body?

53:18.138 --> 53:19.889
Where's the body?

53:20.640 --> 53:22.683
Come on, I need to know.

53:23.143 --> 53:25.561
Where's the body?
What have you done with the body?

53:25.729 --> 53:26.770
There's no body.

53:26.938 --> 53:28.939
Don't fuck about!

53:29.107 --> 53:30.941
Don't bullshit me.
I won't stand for it.

53:31.109 --> 53:33.235
Where is it?
In the house or did you shift it?

53:33.403 --> 53:35.404
There is no body!

53:44.039 --> 53:47.124
Here, look at this.
You got holes in your walls.

53:50.045 --> 53:52.963
They're bullet holes.
Live bullet holes.

53:53.131 --> 53:55.299
I fired two live bullets
to set up the trick ...

53:55.467 --> 53:57.051
and one blank to complete it.

53:57.219 --> 53:59.720
It was a game, I told you.
I played it to the hilt.

53:59.888 --> 54:02.640
It's not worth playing
unless you play it to the hilt.

54:02.807 --> 54:04.975
- The third shot was a blank?
- That's right.

54:05.143 --> 54:06.185
- What's that?
- What?

54:06.353 --> 54:08.437
Blood. Dried blood!

54:08.605 --> 54:10.856
Some of it's not even dried.
It's still damp.

54:11.024 --> 54:12.900
- That's impossible.
- That's blood, chum.

54:13.068 --> 54:15.027
- Whose blood is it?
- It's impossible.

54:15.195 --> 54:16.695
It was a game. It was a blank.

54:16.863 --> 54:19.323
No, it was a game
with real bullets and real blood.

54:19.491 --> 54:20.824
This is a carve-up.

54:20.992 --> 54:24.787
Let's see what else
is new around here.

54:25.330 --> 54:27.164
Hello, what's this?

54:27.999 --> 54:32.002
We've got a shirt, jacket and trousers
in the back of your cupboard.

54:32.170 --> 54:35.005
Very negligent of you, mate,
unless they're not yours.

54:35.173 --> 54:39.134
No, I don't think they're yours.
I think they belong to Tindle.

54:39.302 --> 54:42.054
You say he left the house
after you shot him.

54:42.222 --> 54:44.139
- Yes.
- Naked?

54:44.307 --> 54:45.766
I don't know how those got there.

54:45.934 --> 54:48.352
So you made him strip
before you shot him?

54:48.520 --> 54:50.521
Part of the humiliation, was it?

54:50.689 --> 54:52.189
No. The thing is this.

54:52.357 --> 54:55.401
It might have started as a game,
but it got out of hand.

54:55.568 --> 54:57.903
The third shot was live!

54:58.071 --> 55:01.532
It killed him. So where's the body?

55:01.700 --> 55:03.826
I didn't kill him! He's alive!

55:03.994 --> 55:06.161
Bollocks. You're a joker, all right.

55:06.329 --> 55:07.871
A real joker.

55:08.039 --> 55:09.832
Come on, we're off to the station.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.584
- There's something very wrong here.
- Hey, dead right.

55:12.752 --> 55:16.046
I'll tell you what you are.
You're fucked.

55:16.548 --> 55:17.548
Jesus Christ.

55:17.716 --> 55:20.009
Don't struggle, chum.
I'll have you for breakfast.

55:20.176 --> 55:21.510
There's something wrong here.

55:21.678 --> 55:25.639
You're up shit creek, Wyke.
You're up shit creek without a paddle.

55:28.977 --> 55:32.479
Look at you. All aquiver.

55:33.273 --> 55:35.441
Who's the dead duck?

55:39.154 --> 55:40.571
Jesus Christ.

55:44.159 --> 55:47.911
You're the dead duck.

55:50.623 --> 55:56.420
I just sucked you in
and blew you out in little bubbles.

55:56.588 --> 55:58.088
- It's you.
- It's me, all right.

55:58.256 --> 56:00.632
You bastard. You stinking bastard.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.176
Just a little game, Andrew.

56:02.344 --> 56:04.303
- Just a little game.
- You shit.

56:04.471 --> 56:07.222
- I thought it might amuse you.
- You're a total shit.

56:07.390 --> 56:08.724
I know I am.

56:08.892 --> 56:12.561
- But you're also a genius.
- I know that too.

56:15.023 --> 56:17.316
When did you do this?
The clothes in the wardrobe?

56:17.484 --> 56:20.110
- The blood?
- The blood belongs to a pig's liver.

56:20.278 --> 56:22.446
But when did you do it?
How did you do it?

56:22.614 --> 56:25.616
I did it last night. I used that ladder.
I heard you snoring.

56:25.784 --> 56:28.869
Does Maggie know about this?
Your detective, was it her idea?

56:29.037 --> 56:31.455
- How much does she know?
- She knows nothing about it.

56:31.623 --> 56:34.792
Entirely my own idea.

56:34.959 --> 56:37.961
This is a game between us, old boy.

56:38.129 --> 56:40.964
Between you and me.

56:41.132 --> 56:43.634
Don't forget, I'm half Italian.

56:43.802 --> 56:45.469
We go in for revenge.

56:58.400 --> 57:02.820
After all, you frightened
the life out of me deliberately.

57:02.987 --> 57:05.823
You fired two live bullets
into the wall ...

57:05.990 --> 57:09.743
and then you pointed
the gun at me.

57:09.911 --> 57:12.121
And then you fired.

57:15.959 --> 57:17.584
I don't like guns.

57:18.920 --> 57:20.629
They kill you.

57:23.883 --> 57:25.551
Okay.

57:25.718 --> 57:28.262
So, what does this make the score?

57:29.305 --> 57:31.348
You've had your revenge.

57:31.516 --> 57:35.686
So, what do you reckon?

57:36.187 --> 57:38.147
One set all?

57:38.648 --> 57:41.024
No, no, you're way ahead.

57:41.818 --> 57:46.155
I only teased you with my inspector,
gave you a few goose pimples.

57:47.115 --> 57:48.699
But you frightened me to death.

57:50.952 --> 57:53.495
Did you really think
I was going to kill you?

57:53.663 --> 57:57.291
You fainted, you see.
It was a blank.

57:58.418 --> 58:01.545
I may be three games up
in the second set.

58:01.713 --> 58:02.754
If I had killed you ...

58:02.922 --> 58:06.258
I'd have to bury the body
in the garden or somewhere.

58:06.426 --> 58:07.468
Too exhausting.

58:07.635 --> 58:09.052
But you won the first, 6-love.

58:13.808 --> 58:16.351
So we're a long way
from one set all.

58:22.984 --> 58:26.028
By the way, I spoke to Maggie.

58:26.196 --> 58:29.114
I told her all about you.

58:29.282 --> 58:30.741
She loved it.

58:31.910 --> 58:33.076
Loved what?

58:33.578 --> 58:36.371
That I frightened the life out of you.

58:36.539 --> 58:37.873
That you pissed your pants.

58:39.876 --> 58:42.377
And that you actually fainted.

58:42.545 --> 58:45.506
She said to me,
"You mean he actually fainted?"

58:45.673 --> 58:48.425
I said, "Dead out,
he was scared shitless.

58:49.886 --> 58:51.428
Went out like a light."

58:52.889 --> 58:57.059
She laughed so much,
I thought she was gonna burst.

59:01.481 --> 59:05.442
Oh, incidentally,
she's coming back to me.

59:06.110 --> 59:07.444
Oh, is she?

59:07.612 --> 59:09.321
Yes, that's right.

59:09.489 --> 59:11.281
You know what she said about you?

59:11.449 --> 59:12.491
What?

59:12.659 --> 59:13.951
She said:

59:14.118 --> 59:17.538
"Faint heart never won fair lady."

59:19.999 --> 59:21.166
Is that a fact?

59:21.334 --> 59:22.626
Yeah.

59:24.462 --> 59:28.674
Listen, I want to
show you something.

59:29.133 --> 59:32.469
Go into your study and sit down.

59:34.639 --> 59:36.223
Go into my study?

59:37.725 --> 59:39.935
And sit down.

59:43.439 --> 59:46.400
- What are you doing?
- It's late at night.

59:46.568 --> 59:48.902
You're reading a book under a lamp.
Read something.

59:49.070 --> 59:51.655
- What's going on?
- Read a book.

59:51.823 --> 59:54.199
It's late at night.
You're reading a book.

59:54.367 --> 59:56.493
You hear something. You look up.

59:56.661 --> 59:58.453
It's me jumping off the ladder.

59:58.621 --> 01:00:00.247
You see me with this gun.

01:00:00.415 --> 01:00:04.459
You're caught like a rat in a trap.
You stare at the gun, you're paralyzed.

01:00:04.627 --> 01:00:05.961
I've come for the jewels.

01:00:06.129 --> 01:00:07.838
- Where is the safe?
- What jewels?

01:00:08.006 --> 01:00:09.381
The jewels. Where's the safe?

01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:11.008
- You know where it is.
- I don't.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:13.302
- You don't?
- Don't fuck me about, I mean it.

01:00:13.469 --> 01:00:15.012
Get up.

01:00:15.805 --> 01:00:18.181
You think this gun isn't real?

01:00:20.852 --> 01:00:22.769
Where is it?

01:00:23.521 --> 01:00:26.481
- Upstairs.
- Well, let's go upstairs.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:32.487
Get up these stairs
or I'll ram this gun right up your ass.

01:00:32.697 --> 01:00:35.991
- The safe is behind the fish tank.
- How am I gonna get to it?

01:00:36.159 --> 01:00:38.785
Well, you press the button
and the button moves the tank.

01:00:38.953 --> 01:00:41.204
Then press it.

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:43.957
It's not working. It's out of ord --

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:46.877
Are you a maniac? You're crazy.

01:00:47.045 --> 01:00:49.713
- Open it.
- I changed the combination yesterday.

01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:52.382
- What is it?
- I forgot. I can't remember.

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:54.635
- Remember.
- It's the truth. I can't remember.

01:00:54.802 --> 01:00:55.886
Remember!

01:00:58.973 --> 01:01:00.891
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do?

01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:05.228
I've broken into your house because
I know you have jewels in a safe.

01:01:06.064 --> 01:01:08.732
I have inside information.
I want them.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.318
Remember the combination
and open it.

01:01:18.493 --> 01:01:20.494
It was a blank.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.580
The next one's real.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.934
There's a good boy.

01:02:02.036 --> 01:02:04.454
So, what are you writing
at the moment?

01:02:09.419 --> 01:02:11.128
What am I writing?

01:02:11.587 --> 01:02:13.630
Yes, I'm very interested in literature.

01:02:18.136 --> 01:02:20.804
Do you mind if I have a drink?

01:02:20.972 --> 01:02:24.599
Sure. It's your house.

01:02:24.976 --> 01:02:29.146
I'm always interested
in the people I rob.

01:02:29.355 --> 01:02:33.358
Like I'm always interested
in the husbands of the wives I fuck.

01:02:34.986 --> 01:02:36.695
Are you really?

01:02:37.447 --> 01:02:39.114
Well, well.

01:02:40.283 --> 01:02:41.867
Cheers.

01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:52.961
So, what are you writing?

01:02:57.675 --> 01:03:01.344
It's the story of a pathological killer.

01:03:01.512 --> 01:03:04.639
- I call it The Smiling Man.
- Does he come to a bad end?

01:03:04.807 --> 01:03:07.684
He dies during the act of love.
Like countless others.

01:03:07.852 --> 01:03:09.102
Countless others, eh?

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.688
I can see you've researched
the subject thoroughly.

01:03:12.774 --> 01:03:16.193
- What subject?
- Death in orgasm.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.155
Isn't that a beautiful notion?
To die in the arms of your beloved.

01:03:20.323 --> 01:03:23.992
Can you imagine
anything more poignant?

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.328
- I can't, no.
- No.

01:03:26.496 --> 01:03:30.874
- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yeah, been married 13 years.

01:03:31.042 --> 01:03:32.292
It was love at first sight.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.835
- Very moving.
- Yeah.

01:03:34.003 --> 01:03:36.213
And we're still in love.
Like two peas in a pod.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.965
Someone told me
your wife has a lover.

01:03:39.133 --> 01:03:41.176
- She has, yeah.
- Do you know him?

01:03:41.344 --> 01:03:44.221
No, I've never met him.
He's some sort of Italian.

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:46.723
Called Tandoori or something.

01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:48.892
One of the Bombay Tandooris?

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.061
You've got it, yeah.

01:03:51.229 --> 01:03:54.105
You know something? I've never met
an artistic burglar before.

01:03:54.273 --> 01:03:56.399
That's fantastic.

01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:59.528
- What's your background?
- Me?

01:03:59.695 --> 01:04:02.113
- You.
- Irish. Connemara.

01:04:02.281 --> 01:04:04.491
Spanish descent.
By way of Uganda.

01:04:04.659 --> 01:04:06.368
My grandparents were slaves.

01:04:06.536 --> 01:04:09.579
My mother was a dark-eyed,
dusky beauty.

01:04:09.747 --> 01:04:13.416
- Were you breastfed?
- Oh, sure, like a baby.

01:04:15.044 --> 01:04:20.674
Shall I tell you what I want you to do
with these jewels?

01:04:21.592 --> 01:04:23.093
What?

01:04:35.481 --> 01:04:40.777
You look so charming.

01:04:47.243 --> 01:04:48.785
How do you want it?

01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:50.537
Like this?

01:04:50.705 --> 01:04:53.081
Or shorter?

01:04:54.125 --> 01:04:58.420
How about this?
Or even shorter like a halter?

01:04:58.588 --> 01:05:02.090
- You're hurting me.
- Oh, am I hurting you?

01:05:02.258 --> 01:05:05.969
- Yes. Don't hurt me.
- Are you sensitive to pain?

01:05:06.137 --> 01:05:08.305
Very. Very.

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:11.016
I wouldn't want to hurt you,
sweetheart.

01:05:11.183 --> 01:05:13.685
You're too much fun.

01:05:13.853 --> 01:05:17.689
- Am I really?
- Oh, yes. You're wicked.

01:05:17.857 --> 01:05:20.817
I like that. Yeah.

01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:24.029
Do you know something?

01:05:25.197 --> 01:05:28.325
I don't think
these earrings really suit me.

01:05:30.286 --> 01:05:33.413
You're right. Take them off.

01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:39.127
I don't ...

01:05:39.295 --> 01:05:43.965
I don't think this bracelet
is really my style either.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.261
But the necklace is nice.

01:05:49.639 --> 01:05:50.764
I'm not totally sure.

01:05:50.932 --> 01:05:55.852
Listen, you can play with these jewels
until the cows come home.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:00.523
They're yours.
Do what you like with them.

01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:06.196
But I thought you'd just stolen them.

01:06:06.364 --> 01:06:08.865
No, no! It was a game!

01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:14.037
It was just a game!
I thought it might amuse you.

01:06:31.222 --> 01:06:32.722
Well ...

01:06:34.266 --> 01:06:37.936
Aren't you the wicked one?

01:06:45.361 --> 01:06:46.653
You remember what I said?

01:06:48.322 --> 01:06:51.700
You won the first set, 6-love.
I was 3-love up in the second.

01:06:51.867 --> 01:06:56.287
Well, now it's one set all.

01:07:06.424 --> 01:07:09.968
But who's going to win the third set?

01:07:12.179 --> 01:07:14.264
Remains to be seen.

01:07:33.159 --> 01:07:34.576
You like games, don't you?

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:38.329
Some. Not all.

01:07:38.497 --> 01:07:41.041
But you like being in charge ...

01:07:41.208 --> 01:07:42.959
of the game?

01:07:44.336 --> 01:07:46.671
Oh, yes. Sure.

01:07:48.382 --> 01:07:51.426
I like a man who wants
to be in charge of things.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:54.304
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:57.849
Listen, you've met my wife, I think.

01:07:59.143 --> 01:08:03.021
I have met her. Yes.

01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:06.066
- Did she say if she had a husband?
- Yes.

01:08:06.233 --> 01:08:08.860
Yeah, she said she had a husband.

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:12.322
How did she describe him?

01:08:14.325 --> 01:08:16.743
Remote. Cold.

01:08:16.911 --> 01:08:19.828
Malevolent. Spiteful.

01:08:20.288 --> 01:08:22.916
Arrogant. Ruthless.

01:08:23.084 --> 01:08:24.917
Jealous. Paranoid.

01:08:25.086 --> 01:08:28.962
Criminal tendencies.
Mentally unsound.

01:08:29.173 --> 01:08:30.590
That's me, all right.

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:37.388
You know something?
I like your mind.

01:08:38.099 --> 01:08:40.225
- Do you really?
- It excites me.

01:08:40.643 --> 01:08:42.519
I like the way you go about things.

01:08:44.313 --> 01:08:47.649
You mean you like my style?

01:08:47.817 --> 01:08:50.026
Oh, I like your style.

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:52.694
I like it very much.

01:08:53.823 --> 01:08:57.533
Look, I want to
make you a proposition.

01:08:58.493 --> 01:08:59.993
What?

01:09:02.331 --> 01:09:04.415
I want to show you something.

01:09:08.671 --> 01:09:12.465
- Can't you put that gun down now?
- No.

01:09:12.633 --> 01:09:15.760
God, you're so strong, so ruthless,
aren't you?

01:09:15.928 --> 01:09:16.970
Yes.

01:09:17.138 --> 01:09:19.889
Have you any idea
what my proposition is going to be?

01:09:20.057 --> 01:09:22.433
- No.
- Are you excited?

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.725
I'd say intrigued.

01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:26.645
I think you're going to be excited
very much.

01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:30.233
This is the guest suite.

01:09:31.861 --> 01:09:35.238
Isn't it nice? Look at the view.

01:09:36.282 --> 01:09:38.408
There's a private bathroom.
A small fridge.

01:09:38.576 --> 01:09:43.787
A bottle of Chilean Chardonnay
is chilling in there at this very moment.

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:48.001
This suite is uninhabited.

01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:51.087
It has no occupant.

01:09:56.844 --> 01:09:58.595
How would you like it?

01:10:02.016 --> 01:10:03.308
Me?

01:10:05.603 --> 01:10:07.020
Yes, yes.

01:10:07.188 --> 01:10:11.983
I think I've come to the conclusion
that you're my kind of person.

01:10:14.987 --> 01:10:16.529
Am I, now?

01:10:17.114 --> 01:10:19.657
Well, I told you.
I liked your mind. It excited me.

01:10:19.825 --> 01:10:23.703
I need intellectual excitement.

01:10:23.871 --> 01:10:26.164
Intellectual stimulation.

01:10:28.167 --> 01:10:30.084
Well, they don't grow on trees.

01:10:30.836 --> 01:10:33.129
I'm a rich man.

01:10:33.297 --> 01:10:35.340
What do you want to do?

01:10:35.507 --> 01:10:38.134
I can subsidize anything you want.

01:10:39.178 --> 01:10:41.888
You want to open a bookshop
in the village?

01:10:42.681 --> 01:10:46.309
An art gallery?
Or, of course, a little theater.

01:10:46.769 --> 01:10:47.936
You're a wonderful actor.

01:10:48.103 --> 01:10:52.065
You could choose all the plays
and play all the leading parts.

01:10:53.567 --> 01:10:57.862
But this would be your home.

01:11:02.493 --> 01:11:05.161
And this would be your bedroom.

01:11:10.209 --> 01:11:13.461
You're asking me to live here?

01:11:15.172 --> 01:11:18.633
Yes, I'm asking you to stay with me.

01:11:19.343 --> 01:11:23.638
Oh, we would also travel.
I mean, Jamaica, Swiss Alps.

01:11:23.806 --> 01:11:25.765
I bet you're a wonderful skier,
aren't you?

01:11:25.933 --> 01:11:28.017
You could ski
to your heart's content.

01:11:28.185 --> 01:11:30.061
Swim in the blue Caribbean.

01:11:30.813 --> 01:11:34.190
I'd be waiting at our table
with a Scotch on the rocks.

01:11:34.358 --> 01:11:36.526
Or a chilled Chilean Chardonnay.

01:11:39.363 --> 01:11:41.197
The world would be your oyster.

01:11:43.867 --> 01:11:46.244
But what about Maggie?

01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:49.789
Forget her.

01:11:49.957 --> 01:11:52.000
Let her rot.

01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:54.335
Stay with me.

01:11:54.503 --> 01:11:56.754
You're my kind of person.

01:12:04.805 --> 01:12:07.181
It's quite tempting.

01:12:17.526 --> 01:12:19.610
Hello?

01:12:19.778 --> 01:12:21.321
Hi.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.074
It's going okay.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.246
We're still talking.

01:12:31.582 --> 01:12:34.667
We're on the right track.
It's all going okay.

01:12:35.586 --> 01:12:37.628
Don't come down.

01:12:37.796 --> 01:12:40.757
That would be a mistake.
It's all going fine.

01:12:42.843 --> 01:12:44.802
I love you too.

01:12:46.263 --> 01:12:47.847
I am.

01:12:48.557 --> 01:12:50.516
I'm kissing you.

01:12:51.602 --> 01:12:53.478
Oh, yes.

01:12:54.355 --> 01:12:56.773
I can taste your mouth.

01:13:01.987 --> 01:13:03.946
What the hell did she want?

01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:06.741
She wants that divorce.

01:13:08.619 --> 01:13:10.620
What about my proposition?

01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:17.210
Well, I like the idea of Jamaica.

01:13:17.378 --> 01:13:20.838
- What about Barbados?
- Well, and Barbados, and Antigua.

01:13:21.006 --> 01:13:23.549
Yeah, it's true. There's so many
places I haven't seen.

01:13:23.717 --> 01:13:26.636
Hollywood. Saint Petersburg.

01:13:26.804 --> 01:13:29.305
The Côte d'Azur, Coney Island.

01:13:29.473 --> 01:13:33.267
And I hear there's that wonderful hotel
in Scotland called Balmoral.

01:13:33.435 --> 01:13:36.270
- That's where the queen lives.
- So bed and breakfast is out.

01:13:36.438 --> 01:13:38.856
- It's on if you know the queen.
- I don't.

01:13:39.024 --> 01:13:40.316
I do.

01:13:41.026 --> 01:13:42.652
That's fantastic.

01:13:45.364 --> 01:13:47.240
But seriously, though.

01:13:47.408 --> 01:13:49.951
We could have
such a wonderful time together.

01:13:50.119 --> 01:13:51.577
Venice? Disneyland?

01:13:52.329 --> 01:13:54.789
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

01:13:54.957 --> 01:13:55.998
Whoever you want.

01:13:56.625 --> 01:13:59.460
I could introduce you
to whoever you want.

01:13:59.628 --> 01:14:02.171
Kissinger? Dick Cheney?

01:14:02.339 --> 01:14:03.548
Madonna? Mike Tyson?

01:14:03.715 --> 01:14:04.757
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:14:05.676 --> 01:14:09.887
I must say, that as offers go ...

01:14:11.098 --> 01:14:14.142
it's quite tempting.

01:14:16.728 --> 01:14:19.564
You're a naughty tempter,
aren't you?

01:14:21.525 --> 01:14:25.945
I'm so glad you like my mind.
Not many people like my mind.

01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:28.156
Quite a few people like my body ...

01:14:28.323 --> 01:14:30.867
but I can't think of anyone
who likes my mind.

01:14:32.202 --> 01:14:34.745
That makes you unique.

01:14:35.581 --> 01:14:38.207
But then, of course,
you know what they say.

01:14:38.375 --> 01:14:40.376
The mind is the body.

01:14:41.378 --> 01:14:42.462
Is that what they say?

01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:45.882
Somebody said something like it once.
Bullshit, of course. Anyway ...

01:14:46.842 --> 01:14:50.470
Perhaps I am your sort of person.
Who knows?

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:56.434
But you would have
to be very nice to me.

01:14:56.643 --> 01:15:00.688
For instance,
just at this moment, I need a drink.

01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:13.075
You can get your own drink.

01:15:13.243 --> 01:15:16.245
No, you get it for me
and I might be nice to you.

01:15:16.413 --> 01:15:18.664
- Nice to me?
- That's what I said.

01:15:18.832 --> 01:15:20.082
Whisky, please.

01:15:39.228 --> 01:15:43.397
Can't deny, I can be
quite a congenial companion.

01:15:43.565 --> 01:15:45.566
I really -- I can't deny it.

01:15:48.403 --> 01:15:54.867
I could be quite a witty companion.

01:15:55.786 --> 01:16:00.748
Would you like a witty companion?

01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:05.753
- Very much.
- I'm particularly witty in the morning.

01:16:05.921 --> 01:16:07.171
Would that suit you?

01:16:08.382 --> 01:16:13.970
Some people hate wit in the morning.
What about you?

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:15.596
I love wit in the morning.

01:16:17.474 --> 01:16:19.350
Over boiled eggs?

01:16:21.895 --> 01:16:23.312
Do you like eggs?

01:16:23.939 --> 01:16:24.981
Absolutely.

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:32.780
I'm a dab hand in the kitchen.

01:16:33.323 --> 01:16:39.495
But you have to be nice to me
and get me a drink when I ask for it.

01:17:02.269 --> 01:17:03.894
You see?

01:17:05.355 --> 01:17:08.524
You can be really sweet ...

01:17:08.692 --> 01:17:10.860
when you put your mind to it.

01:17:11.028 --> 01:17:12.695
Cheers.

01:17:17.951 --> 01:17:20.870
Listen, I can see what you're saying.

01:17:21.038 --> 01:17:24.373
I can see why
you're inviting me to live with you.

01:17:24.541 --> 01:17:27.001
I can see that you're lonely.

01:17:27.169 --> 01:17:30.630
That you need looking after.
It's obvious.

01:17:30.797 --> 01:17:34.717
You need someone
who would cater for your every whim.

01:17:34.885 --> 01:17:36.844
Don't you?

01:17:37.012 --> 01:17:38.512
I do.

01:17:45.437 --> 01:17:48.564
Hello? Darling.

01:17:48.732 --> 01:17:50.191
What?

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:54.695
Oh, is that so?

01:17:54.863 --> 01:17:56.322
Are you?

01:17:59.368 --> 01:18:01.369
I see.

01:18:01.536 --> 01:18:03.245
Are you sure?

01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:04.955
I see.

01:18:05.666 --> 01:18:07.416
I got it.

01:18:09.544 --> 01:18:12.588
I told you I got it. I understand.

01:18:13.423 --> 01:18:15.007
Okay.

01:18:15.801 --> 01:18:19.261
- Okay, I'll tell him.
- Tell me what?

01:18:22.933 --> 01:18:26.352
- That she loves you.
- Is that so?

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.146
- What else did she say?
- Nothing.

01:18:29.314 --> 01:18:30.564
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

01:18:30.732 --> 01:18:34.276
Listen, for chrissake,
make up your mind.

01:18:34.444 --> 01:18:38.781
I'm offering you something special.
Something very special.

01:18:38.949 --> 01:18:42.702
We seal it with a handshake.
And she's nowhere.

01:18:42.869 --> 01:18:46.622
We cut her out, you understand?
We cut her out of our lives.

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:48.958
Don't let her dominate you.
Be yourself.

01:18:49.126 --> 01:18:51.836
- Be independent. Be free.
- Like you?

01:18:52.003 --> 01:18:54.755
That's right. Be free like me.

01:19:31.001 --> 01:19:35.045
I've always been attracted ...

01:19:35.213 --> 01:19:38.048
to rich and powerful men.

01:19:38.508 --> 01:19:41.343
Rich and powerful men
make all the girls quiver ...

01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:44.430
like a jelly on a plate.

01:19:44.598 --> 01:19:45.931
But you're not a girl.

01:19:47.601 --> 01:19:51.854
Tickles the old cobblers, money.

01:19:52.022 --> 01:19:56.150
- Girls don't have cobblers.
- You'd be surprised.

01:20:01.198 --> 01:20:03.199
But you're not a girl.

01:20:04.117 --> 01:20:06.285
I may be once.

01:20:07.162 --> 01:20:09.622
Back in the good old days.

01:20:11.291 --> 01:20:14.043
Maybe the good old days
are coming back.

01:20:14.961 --> 01:20:17.004
Who knows?

01:20:18.048 --> 01:20:19.840
Look ...

01:20:22.552 --> 01:20:25.554
I'd really like to see your bed.

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:29.934
I mean, let me be quite clear.

01:20:30.101 --> 01:20:34.021
This looks a very nice bed indeed.

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:37.566
But yours is bigger.

01:20:39.653 --> 01:20:43.239
- Can I take another look?
- Sure.

01:20:45.408 --> 01:20:47.535
Is this how you do it?

01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:55.751
Miraculous.

01:21:06.596 --> 01:21:09.348
I could really get to like this.

01:21:09.516 --> 01:21:14.687
Of course,
this is the marriage bed, isn't it?

01:21:15.856 --> 01:21:18.566
Is this where she took
your virginity?

01:21:18.733 --> 01:21:21.068
Is this where your wife
deflowered you?

01:21:21.236 --> 01:21:23.904
Is this where you were deflowered?

01:21:25.782 --> 01:21:27.783
It's a lovely bed.

01:21:28.618 --> 01:21:31.662
So bouncy.

01:21:37.377 --> 01:21:42.965
I'm so touched that you've
offered me a place in your heart.

01:21:43.133 --> 01:21:45.509
In your life.

01:21:45.677 --> 01:21:47.636
I'm touched.

01:21:58.982 --> 01:22:05.905
Take your hand off me.

01:22:08.325 --> 01:22:11.118
Fuck off. Fuck off, you big poof!

01:22:11.536 --> 01:22:14.955
Jesus. I come here
as an innocent bystander.

01:22:15.123 --> 01:22:17.750
As a totally respectable individual.

01:22:17.918 --> 01:22:21.503
A humble part-time hairdresser.
And you try to corrupt me.

01:22:21.671 --> 01:22:24.590
You try to seduce me.
Do you know what you are?

01:22:24.758 --> 01:22:25.799
You're a menace.

01:22:25.967 --> 01:22:29.845
Also, you're a cunt.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.516
Well, now you really are charming.

01:22:34.684 --> 01:22:37.019
- Know who's gonna love this story?
- What story?

01:22:37.187 --> 01:22:38.771
- This one. This one.
- Who?

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.356
- Maggie.
- Really?

01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:42.816
By the way, she asked me
to tell you something.

01:22:42.984 --> 01:22:44.818
- What?
- That she's coming back to you.

01:22:45.362 --> 01:22:48.739
- She's on her way.
- She's coming back to me?

01:22:48.949 --> 01:22:51.367
- That's what she told me.
- I don't want her.

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:54.370
Well, you've got her. She's all yours.
You're welcome to her.

01:22:54.537 --> 01:22:58.874
She loves your money, baby.
That's the nub of it.

01:22:59.751 --> 01:23:01.293
I don't want her.

01:23:07.217 --> 01:23:09.593
- What are you doing with that coat?
- I'm taking it.

01:23:09.803 --> 01:23:11.595
Tell Maggie I'll be in touch.

01:23:11.763 --> 01:23:14.807
I want to have a drink with her.
Bring her up to date.

01:23:16.977 --> 01:23:21.063
How do you like me in this coat?
Do you fancy me?

01:23:24.901 --> 01:23:27.653
Goodbye, darling.

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.867
Wait a minute.

01:23:35.078 --> 01:23:37.037
Yes? What?

01:23:44.587 --> 01:23:46.463
Goodbye, darling.
