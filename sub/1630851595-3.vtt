of powerful narcotics.

43:25.584 --> 43:28.462

Chronic Pain Association,

43:28.462 --> 43:31.048

43:31.048 --> 43:33.592
an entire network
of pain groups

43:33.592 --> 43:36.637

as independent,

to specialists,

44:44.705 --> 44:46.624

that it sends you to

44:46.624 --> 44:50.586
is a doctor with a very high
rate of prescribing OxyContin.

the fifth vital sign."

And, of course,
the solution for pain

45:15.486 --> 45:20.991

an increased use of opioids.

one of those.

55:10.789 --> 55:13.542
I don't know.

55:13.542 --> 55:16.169

DOCTOR: All right.

55:17.587 --> 55:21.424
