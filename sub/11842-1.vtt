09:49.458 --> 09:53.375
WITH A LOT OF MIGHT.

WHAT SHE WAS DOING,

09:56.683 --> 09:59.337

[ HUMMING ]

10:03.341 --> 10:04.386
IS SHE STILL BREATHING?!

10:14.265 --> 10:16.180
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO TURN HER OVER.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.099
COULD THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME
ON THE ROOF?

10:22.143 --> 10:23.623
COULD I HAVE BEEN SWARMED?
IN MY UNDERWEAR, TOO.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.450
I COULD HAVE BEEN SWARMED
IN MY UNDERWEAR.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.281
THAT'S AN ASSAULT
ON MY IMAGINATION.

WAS BLOATED AND FULL OF PUS

10:44.382 --> 10:46.428
BECAUSE SHE WAS SABOTAGING
BETTY'S BEES.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.908

FOR BETTY,

HAVE ONE?

14:52.979 --> 14:54.502
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.156
IT DOES, BUT IT ALSO SPEAKS
TO THE EFFICIENCY

I WONDER HOW ELSE

TATTERED BY EVERY GRAIN OF SAND
IN THE HOURGLASS,

15:06.644 --> 15:08.951
BETTY'S BEES STILL NEEDS
A FRESH, YOUNG FACE,

15:08.995 --> 15:10.387
AND AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
TO KENTUCKY,

15:10.431 --> 15:11.693

TO THINK ABOUT THAT

KENTUCKY WAS GONNA BE
THE NEW FACE OF BETTY'S BEES,

15:45.683 --> 15:47.729

GIVE BETTY MOTIVE.

15:47.772 --> 15:48.904

AND BETTER-LOOKING

15:48.948 --> 15:50.514
ALWAYS GIVES YOU MOTIVE.

15:50.558 --> 15:53.517

BY WOOLSEY NICHOLLS,

NOT BEES.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.179

16:03.223 --> 16:05.747
THEY WERE LOVERS
OF THE SAME-SEX PERSUASION,

16:05.790 --> 16:08.358
AND THE KEY
IS FOR THEIR LOVE NEST.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.491
MM, WE'VE RULED OUT

16:10.534 --> 16:11.883
OH.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.321
I'LL JUST CROSS THAT
OFF MY LIST, THEN.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.801
I HAVEN'T RULED OUT
WORKPLACE ROMANCE.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.673

GIVE YOU MOTIVE.

THEY SHOULDN'T BE LOVING.

16:24.853 --> 16:28.291
-IS THAT FOR YOUR AUNTS?
-MM-HMM. EXTRA VANILLA.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.990
Narrator: OLIVE SNOOK
DISCOVERED IT WASN'T VANILLA

16:31.033 --> 16:33.601
WHILE DELIVERING PIE
TO CHUCK'S AUNTS.

16:33.644 --> 16:37.344
IT WASN'T THE ONLY SECRET
SHE WOULD DISCOVER THAT NIGHT.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.607
THE HIGH DOSES
OF HERBAL MOOD ENHANCERS

16:39.650 --> 16:42.566
NOT ONLY CAUSED
PARTICULARLY VIVID SIDE EFFECTS,

16:42.610 --> 16:45.047
BUT THEY ALSO PROMPTED
A CONFESSION.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.136

16:47.180 --> 16:48.529

IT WAS A CONFESSION

NOT EVEN LILY'S SISTER, VIVIAN,
HAD HEARD,

16:50.966 --> 16:52.924
AND TO ENSURE
THAT SHE NEVER WOULD,

16:52.968 --> 16:55.666
LILY BANISHED OLIVE
FROM THEIR LIVES.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.887
SINCE BOTH CHUCK AND HER MOTHER
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD,

16:58.930 --> 17:01.020
NEITHER COULD KNOW
THE OTHER WAS ALIVE.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.804
I DON'T KNOW
IF BETTY KILLED KENTUCKY

17:02.847 --> 17:05.024
OR IF SHE DIDN'T KILL KENTUCKY,
BUT I KNOW THIS.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.374
BETTY KNOWS SOMETHING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.984
ALRIGHT, I'LL GIVE BETTY
THE SHAKEDOWN TOMORROW.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.420
NO. NO SHAKING.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.726
WHAT IF SOMEONE
FROM BETTY'S BEES

17:11.769 --> 17:13.554
FINDS OUT YOU'RE A SPY?

17:13.597 --> 17:15.991
SPYING IS A LOT LIKE SABOTAGE
IN THAT THEY KILL YOU FOR IT.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.602
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH SPIES
AND SABOTEURS -- YOU KILL THEM.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.649
AND YOU DON'T FEEL BAD BECAUSE
THEY'RE SPYING AND SABOTAGING.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.912
NED, THEY'RE NOT GONNA KILL ME
DURING OFFICE HOURS.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.218
YEAH.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.176
STOP TRYING TO SPOOK
MY INSIDE MAN.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.526
YOU COULD DIE.
AND YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.224
TOLD YOU SHE WASN'T DEAD.

17:36.316 --> 17:39.667
IF I COULD BREATHE,
I WOULD VOMIT.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.103
OLIVE SNOOK,

17:41.147 --> 17:42.583
EVERY WEEK
A DELICIOUS LIFE-GIVING PIE,

17:42.626 --> 17:44.193
AND THEN NOTHING
FOR MONTHS.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.674
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD,
AND SO SOON AFTER CHARLOTTE.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.545
I WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE
EVERYONE'S DYING PERSONALLY.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.851
WE WOULD HAVE CALLED,

17:49.894 --> 17:51.374
BUT BY THE TIME I KNEW
WE WERE COMING,

17:51.418 --> 17:52.897
VIVIAN WAS ALREADY
ON THE BUS.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.595
LILY WAS VERY TENACIOUS.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.641
SHE TRIED TO GET ME TO COME HOME
IN SIX CONSECUTIVE STOPS.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.295
SHE INSISTED ON COMING
ALL THIS WAY

17:59.339 --> 18:02.820
JUST TO ASK
WHY YOU STOPPED DELIVERING PIES.

18:02.864 --> 18:05.736
I'M...

18:05.780 --> 18:07.608
...REALLY FLAKY.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.089
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER!
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PIES,

18:10.132 --> 18:12.569
ALTHOUGH THE PIES WERE ALWAYS
LOVELY AND SO VIVID.

18:12.613 --> 18:16.356
