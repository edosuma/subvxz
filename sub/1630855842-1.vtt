WEBVTT

02:32.915 --> 02:35.918
Oh, fuck.

02:42.659 --> 02:45.160
Hello?

02:45.293 --> 02:46.763
Emma?

02:46.896 --> 02:48.865
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, you picked up.

02:48.998 --> 02:50.298
What do you want?

02:50.432 --> 02:53.836
Just surprised I didn't, uh--

02:53.970 --> 02:55.672
Yeah, me too.

02:55.805 --> 02:58.808
Well, uh...

03:01.944 --> 03:03.412
...just wanted to, uh,
talk to you,

03:03.546 --> 03:06.281
you know, and see
how you're doing and, uh--

03:06.415 --> 03:07.884
Why?

03:08.017 --> 03:10.385
Well, I just...

03:16.191 --> 03:18.293
Look, I know. uh...

03:18.427 --> 03:20.395
I know I screwed up, honey,

03:20.530 --> 03:24.199
and, uh-- I just want to say
I'm sorry, okay?

03:24.332 --> 03:26.736
To you and your mom,
I am so, so sorry.

03:26.869 --> 03:29.539
Are you fucking serious
right now?

03:29.672 --> 03:31.007
What?

03:31.140 --> 03:32.141
What the hell is
wrong with you?

03:32.274 --> 03:33.442
Nothing's wrong with me.

03:33.576 --> 03:37.345
I'm just-- I'm, uh--
just wanted--

03:37.479 --> 03:39.649
What makes you think that
I want to hear that?

03:39.782 --> 03:44.419
Why is-- Why is now the time
for me to hear that?

03:44.554 --> 03:45.722
Come on, honey.

03:45.855 --> 03:47.222
I tried calling plenty
of times before,

03:47.355 --> 03:48.591
and you didn't pick up
and I--

03:48.725 --> 03:49.992
So it's my fault?

03:50.126 --> 03:51.594
No, it's no one's fault.
It's no one's fault.

03:51.728 --> 03:56.132
I just, uh--
I'm here.

03:56.264 --> 03:57.265
You're here now?

03:57.399 --> 03:59.001
Are you fucking kidding me?

03:59.135 --> 04:00.636
No, I'm not kidding. Okay?

04:00.770 --> 04:02.538
I am trying to say I'm sorry.

04:02.672 --> 04:04.140
I am trying to apologize.

04:04.272 --> 04:06.509
I'm trying to fix this mistake.

04:06.642 --> 04:09.078
And I think the least you could
do is just listen

04:09.212 --> 04:10.513
to what I have to say.

04:10.646 --> 04:12.548
How can I apologize
if you will not listen

04:12.682 --> 04:14.016
to what I have to say?

04:16.451 --> 04:19.321
Em?

04:19.654 --> 04:23.226
Emma please tell me
you're still there.

04:23.358 --> 04:24.292
I'm not.

04:24.426 --> 04:25.528
Emma!
Don't hang up!

04:25.661 --> 04:26.361
Fuck you.

04:26.495 --> 04:27.230
Please don't.

04:44.714 --> 04:46.783
I tried.

04:46.916 --> 04:48.684
I did, I tried.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.955
She won't listen to me.

04:53.089 --> 04:56.659
She won't listen
to what I have to say.

05:02.999 --> 05:04.499
I tried.

05:04.634 --> 05:07.670
I really tried.

05:16.145 --> 05:19.182
Stop, please.

05:19.314 --> 05:20.750
Don't--

05:35.264 --> 05:38.601
Stop.

05:42.905 --> 05:45.808
Oh, no,
no, no, no.

05:46.309 --> 05:48.578
Wait, wait--
Please!

05:54.183 --> 05:57.053
No! Ah!

06:13.669 --> 06:15.905
No!

10:25.555 --> 10:27.456
-Jocelyn.
-Pastor Lewis.

10:27.591 --> 10:28.390
Thank you again.

10:28.525 --> 10:29.692
It was a lovely service.

10:29.825 --> 10:31.561
Of course.

10:31.694 --> 10:34.363
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

10:34.497 --> 10:37.366
Thank you.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.077
Hey, JC.

10:48.210 --> 10:50.146
Hey, guys.

10:51.515 --> 10:52.448
Thanks for coming.

10:52.582 --> 10:53.749
Of course.

10:53.883 --> 10:55.284
If you need anything,
let us know.

10:55.417 --> 10:56.819
Thank you.

10:56.952 --> 10:58.354
Is that her?

11:00.656 --> 11:04.326
- Yeah, it is.
- Huh.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.263
I'm surprised she came.

11:08.330 --> 11:09.899
Yeah, me too.

11:17.773 --> 11:19.141
Hey, sweetie.

11:19.275 --> 11:20.276
Hey, Mom.

11:20.409 --> 11:21.377
How are you?

11:21.511 --> 11:22.845
I'm okay.

11:22.978 --> 11:26.415
Just wanted to let you know
that it's done.

11:26.550 --> 11:27.816
The service is over.

11:27.950 --> 11:30.286
Oh, okay.

11:30.419 --> 11:31.420
How was it?

11:31.555 --> 11:33.989
Um... Fine. I mean--

11:35.424 --> 11:37.426
Do you really care
how nice it was?

11:37.561 --> 11:39.195
I mean, I guess it doesn't
really matter.

11:40.930 --> 11:43.232
I just care
about how you're doing.

11:43.365 --> 11:45.701
I'm fine. Really.

11:45.834 --> 11:46.702
Yeah?

11:46.835 --> 11:48.538
And how's Maryland?

11:48.672 --> 11:51.941
Well, I leave in two days,
so I'm looking forward to that.

11:52.074 --> 11:52.775
Good answer.

11:54.343 --> 11:57.246
Will I get to see you?

11:57.379 --> 12:00.049
Uh, no.

12:00.182 --> 12:02.586
I'm headed straight
to Dallas for the tour start.

12:02.718 --> 12:06.422
Oh... just going right
back to work.

12:06.556 --> 12:08.457
Yeah... it's supposed
to be a good gig.

12:08.592 --> 12:09.725
Pays really well.

12:09.858 --> 12:11.327
Okay.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.362
I just want to make sure
you're not burning yourself out.

12:13.495 --> 12:14.897
I know.

12:15.030 --> 12:18.267
Have you talked to Jocelyn?

12:18.434 --> 12:22.037
Um, yeah, we talked.

12:22.338 --> 12:23.305
Yeah?

12:23.439 --> 12:24.440
How'd that go?

12:24.574 --> 12:26.710
I don't know, it was short.

12:26.842 --> 12:28.277
She wants to see me tomorrow.

12:28.410 --> 12:31.480
Oh. For what?

12:31.615 --> 12:32.582
I don't know.

12:32.716 --> 12:34.584
Like... to talk more, I guess?

12:34.718 --> 12:37.886
Well, that might be good.

12:38.153 --> 12:40.289
Well,
I don't think I'm gonna go.

12:40.422 --> 12:42.157
Okay.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.426
I mean, if that's
what you're comfortable with.

12:44.994 --> 12:46.895
I just don't see the point.

12:47.029 --> 12:47.930
I get that.

12:48.063 --> 12:49.633
Trust me, I do.

12:49.765 --> 12:54.770
But keep in mind,
she lost him, too, Em.

12:55.371 --> 12:58.140
It might be good to just hear
what she has to say.

12:58.274 --> 13:00.109
At least this one time.

13:02.244 --> 13:05.414
Look, you just do what's best
for you, okay?

13:05.848 --> 13:07.983
Uh, yeah.

13:11.086 --> 13:14.390
Call me when your flight lands,
okay?

13:15.858 --> 13:17.326
Yeah I will.

13:17.459 --> 13:19.862
All right. Love you, Em.

13:19.995 --> 13:22.831
Love you.

13:40.215 --> 13:41.984
- Hey, buddy!
- What're you doin?

13:43.218 --> 13:44.119
The service is over, pal.

13:44.253 --> 13:46.055
You can't be here.

13:47.156 --> 13:49.491
Jesus, man.
Get the fuck outta here!

13:49.626 --> 13:51.860
Or we're calling the cops.

13:53.495 --> 13:55.431
Unbelievable.

14:08.611 --> 14:11.113
Seriously? Hey!

14:11.246 --> 14:12.515
What'd I tell you before?

14:12.649 --> 14:14.617
Get the hell out of here!

14:16.820 --> 14:17.721
Paul?

14:17.853 --> 14:19.254
Call the cops on this guy.

14:26.061 --> 14:27.630
Unbelievable.

14:45.381 --> 14:48.384
Couldn't find a better photo
of this guy?

14:51.521 --> 14:52.187
Paul.

14:52.321 --> 14:54.657
Call the fucking police.

15:00.797 --> 15:02.331
Jimmy, what happened?

15:02.464 --> 15:03.600
911. What's your emergency?

15:03.733 --> 15:05.267
My friend fell and hit his head.

15:05.401 --> 15:07.136
Is your friend conscious?

15:07.269 --> 15:09.539
No, I don't-- I don't even
think he's breathing.

15:09.672 --> 15:12.776
Okay, sir,
what is your location?

15:12.908 --> 15:15.177
Yeah, it's uh--

15:17.112 --> 15:18.782
Sir?

15:18.914 --> 15:21.551
I need to know your location
so I can send an ambulance.

15:27.956 --> 15:29.925
Hey, you fucking drop him!

15:30.058 --> 15:32.060
Is someone there with you?

15:32.194 --> 15:33.797
Yeah. He's uh--

16:14.737 --> 16:18.273
Hello? Sir?
Are you still there?

16:18.407 --> 16:21.578
Sir? Is anyone still there?

16:21.711 --> 16:23.979
I need to know
your location, sir.

16:24.112 --> 16:25.949
I need to get you assistance.

16:26.081 --> 16:29.485
If you can still hear me,
please stay on the line.

16:55.344 --> 16:56.579
-Sorry!
-Sorry!

17:29.946 --> 17:32.949
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:33.315 --> 17:35.852
You want anything to drink?

17:35.985 --> 17:37.754
I'm okay for now.

17:48.731 --> 17:51.834
Happy you decided
to actually come.

17:52.467 --> 17:57.139
And it's nice to finally,
officially meet you.

17:58.206 --> 18:01.044
Yeah, that's--
That's true.

18:01.176 --> 18:02.645
Where are you staying?

18:02.779 --> 18:05.414
That little motel
on Patrick Street.

18:05.548 --> 18:07.684
That's far, isn't it?

18:07.817 --> 18:08.952
It's cheap.

18:09.084 --> 18:12.154
Well, hey.
Cheers to that.

18:12.287 --> 18:14.023
Yeah.

18:14.156 --> 18:16.358
No? Bad cheers.

18:16.491 --> 18:19.729
Hair in the sink is going to be
a no cheers for me.

18:19.862 --> 18:20.830
Long hair or short hair?

18:20.964 --> 18:22.364
They're pubes.

18:24.534 --> 18:28.605
Yeah. Okay, I take it back.
Bad cheers.

18:29.639 --> 18:31.908
So I'm crouching down behind him
wrapping this cable,

18:32.041 --> 18:34.109
and he's like, sure,
I'll pose for a photo.

18:34.242 --> 18:38.047
And then he turns around
and drops his pants

18:38.180 --> 18:39.181
all the way to the ground

18:39.314 --> 18:40.717
and just flashes
his ass at them.

18:40.850 --> 18:42.284
What?

18:42.417 --> 18:45.054
Meanwhile, ya know, my
face is just at dick height.

18:45.187 --> 18:48.558
Oh, no!
So, just a face full of baloney.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.794
Oh, that is awful.

18:51.928 --> 18:55.098
That is rock stars.

18:55.798 --> 18:58.001
I would give anything
to be a roadie.

18:58.133 --> 19:00.435
A backline technician.

19:00.803 --> 19:01.604
And that, too.

19:03.039 --> 19:05.340
It has its ups and downs.

19:05.474 --> 19:10.680
You get to travel and see some
pretty amazing things.

19:10.813 --> 19:12.582
It gets a little lonely.

19:16.151 --> 19:18.420
But it doesn't bother me.

19:20.923 --> 19:22.925
I could never do it.

19:23.059 --> 19:24.927
- No?
- No.

19:26.029 --> 19:28.531
It's not in the cards
for someone like me.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.168
What does that mean?

19:33.301 --> 19:35.772
My whole life
has been planned out

19:35.905 --> 19:37.840
for a long time.

19:41.944 --> 19:45.380
Graduate college
with a major in communications.

19:45.515 --> 19:48.183
Move to Baltimore,
work at the marketing firm

19:48.316 --> 19:49.786
that my mom used to work at.

19:49.919 --> 19:52.889
Meet a fine, upstanding man
named Dave.

19:54.322 --> 19:56.125
-Get married with a prenup.
-Sure.

19:56.258 --> 19:58.594
Have more than one kid.

19:58.728 --> 20:00.429
Become less attractive to Dave.

20:00.563 --> 20:03.633
Financially support all of
his mid-life crisis hobbies.

20:03.766 --> 20:04.867
Resent him.

20:05.001 --> 20:06.769
Catch him cheating,
spend the next six months

20:06.903 --> 20:08.437
methodically plotting
his murder.

20:08.571 --> 20:10.973
Send the kids to college.

20:12.508 --> 20:14.977
Like I said, it's all
been planned out.

20:18.380 --> 20:19.649
Fucking Dave.

20:20.817 --> 20:22.985
Fucking Dave.

20:25.788 --> 20:29.324
Well, hey, there was, um...

20:29.458 --> 20:32.695
...something that
I wanted to show you.

20:43.106 --> 20:48.276
I wasn't sure I, um--
I thought you might want it.

20:51.981 --> 20:53.883
Do you remember
taking it with him?

20:55.952 --> 20:58.788
-You look so happy--
-Where'd you get this?

21:00.823 --> 21:02.859
It was, um...

21:04.359 --> 21:06.361
It was with him that night.

21:12.902 --> 21:15.772
I mean,
it must mean something, right?

21:17.573 --> 21:20.777
When was the last time
that you talked to him?

21:20.910 --> 21:22.512
Do you remember?

21:24.013 --> 21:26.448
What does it matter?

21:26.582 --> 21:30.418
I'm... I'm sorry if that made
things awkward.

21:30.553 --> 21:33.856
What did you expect to happen?

21:34.056 --> 21:36.424
I don't know, I--

21:36.559 --> 21:37.960
I thought that
maybe we could talk.

21:38.094 --> 21:40.428
I don't understand why?

21:41.396 --> 21:42.899
Because he was our father--

21:43.032 --> 21:44.634
He was not my father.

21:47.837 --> 21:49.939
What did you think that
this was going to make us

21:50.072 --> 21:52.775
friends? Family?

21:54.911 --> 21:57.780
I thought that might be
up to us.

21:57.914 --> 21:59.081
Right.

22:03.186 --> 22:05.387
Why did you come?

22:05.521 --> 22:06.889
Why were you there yesterday?

22:07.023 --> 22:09.926
I mean, how much of him
do you even remember?

22:12.094 --> 22:13.563
I remember...

22:13.696 --> 22:16.666
...waking up to my mom
crying at the kitchen table

22:16.799 --> 22:18.668
because the night
before he left.

22:18.801 --> 22:21.938
He just packed up
and moved out.

22:23.338 --> 22:24.507
I'm sorry--

22:24.640 --> 22:28.077
A couple years later,
we got word that

22:28.211 --> 22:29.779
he was married again.

22:29.912 --> 22:33.282
And not long after that,
he had a beautiful daughter.

22:34.050 --> 22:37.086
I guess Daddy finally
got his little girl.

22:44.093 --> 22:44.894
Fuck.

22:46.262 --> 22:48.998
You want to know why
I was there yesterday?

22:52.068 --> 22:55.771
I have hated this man
my entire life.

22:56.305 --> 23:00.209
I hated him for what he did to
my mom, for what he did to me.

23:00.442 --> 23:02.144
He was not a father to me.
No, he--

23:02.278 --> 23:05.948
He took that,
and he gave it to somebody else.

23:06.082 --> 23:08.851
So fuck him. Right?

23:08.985 --> 23:15.524
I am just so sick of feeling
this pit of shit inside me.

23:16.325 --> 23:17.827
And I thought...

23:17.960 --> 23:22.031
...maybe if I come here,
I'll finally get something.

23:23.065 --> 23:25.601
And maybe I can just sever
this-- this hate

23:25.735 --> 23:28.037
and finally just stop hurting.

23:30.172 --> 23:31.641
And I'm...

23:31.774 --> 23:37.113
...standing there yesterday
staring at this casket.

23:38.681 --> 23:41.550
And I can't help thinking,

23:42.218 --> 23:45.855
"If I never truly cared
for this man, ever...

23:49.191 --> 23:53.062
...then why am I standing here
so fucking sad?"

23:55.331 --> 24:02.672
Why do I have to feel the hate
and the anger and the grief?

24:03.306 --> 24:05.708
Can I-- Can I be spared that?

24:05.841 --> 24:07.510
How is that fucking fair?!

24:07.643 --> 24:09.779
I don't know.

24:21.791 --> 24:24.961
Yeah, I don't think I want that.

24:28.264 --> 24:30.166
Okay.

24:44.347 --> 24:45.982
Hey, Frank.

24:46.115 --> 24:47.917
Hey, JC.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.855
Thanks.

24:54.724 --> 24:57.927
I know it's probably
a stupid question, but...

24:58.461 --> 25:00.463
How you holding up?

25:00.863 --> 25:04.800
I'm hanging in there.

25:04.934 --> 25:08.204
Pastor Lewis gave
a lovely service.

25:08.904 --> 25:12.241
Yeah, I'm sure. The John Wheeler
I knew was a good man.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.343
John Wheeler?

25:14.477 --> 25:17.046
What a wretched way to go.

25:17.179 --> 25:18.581
Come on, Larry.

25:18.714 --> 25:22.818
How long, do you think, until
they name it "Wheeler Bridge"

25:23.052 --> 25:25.621
like he was some war hero?

25:25.755 --> 25:27.256
-All right.
-I got to go.

25:27.390 --> 25:31.193
I worked with John Wheeler
for 15 years at the factory.

25:31.527 --> 25:36.298
Now, I never really knew him,
but that man was no hero.

25:36.532 --> 25:39.435
That man had secrets.

25:39.935 --> 25:43.139
-Demons.
-Stop.

25:45.274 --> 25:47.843
Makes you wonder
if it was even a real suicide.

25:47.977 --> 25:50.479
Jesus Christ, Larry.
This is his daughter.

25:50.613 --> 25:53.482
She doesn't need to be hearing
that shit right now.

25:54.617 --> 25:58.220
-JC, honey. I'm sorry.
-Thanks for the drinks, Frank.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.862
What the fuck is wrong with you?

26:19.809 --> 26:22.711
Oh, Jesus Christ.

27:14.396 --> 27:16.899
Entry door sensor.

27:23.607 --> 27:26.408
Hey, how's it going?

27:31.313 --> 27:33.849
Who's that?

27:33.983 --> 27:36.652
Some asshole in a cheap suit.

27:39.355 --> 27:42.224
I guess he's taking
a liking to you.

27:45.895 --> 27:49.231
And, uh, can't say I blame him.

27:57.873 --> 28:00.276
Well, I'm here if you need
anything.

28:35.512 --> 28:37.547
Bryce, you're only supposed
to take one.

28:37.681 --> 28:38.847
Who cares?

28:38.981 --> 28:42.084
Well,
I'm not getting in trouble.

29:00.469 --> 29:03.072
Trick or treat.

29:09.311 --> 29:12.448
That's not real magic.

29:12.748 --> 29:14.216
You hid that up your sleeve.

29:14.350 --> 29:15.784
That was fake.

29:15.918 --> 29:18.487
Bryce. Stop.

29:22.057 --> 29:25.027
You're going to give me
some now?

29:26.295 --> 29:28.297
Hey.

29:33.737 --> 29:35.505
Hey!

29:39.875 --> 29:41.310
Stop!

29:44.648 --> 29:46.115
I said stop it!

29:50.919 --> 29:52.756
Gimme those back!

29:54.524 --> 29:56.158
Let me go! Please!

29:56.292 --> 29:56.992
Let me go!

29:57.126 --> 29:58.561
Get off of me!
Help me!

29:58.695 --> 29:59.529
Help me!

30:21.651 --> 30:22.519
Let me go!

30:22.652 --> 30:24.320
Get off of me! Help me!

30:24.453 --> 30:26.322
Help me!

30:46.743 --> 30:49.679
-Trick or treat!
-Trick or treat!

30:49.813 --> 30:51.080
You guys look great!

30:51.213 --> 30:53.148
-Thank you Miss Jocelyn.
-Thank you Miss Jocelyn.

30:53.282 --> 30:54.883
Happy Halloween, guys.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.630
The ghosts are moving tonight.

31:07.764 --> 31:10.899
Restless. Hungry.

31:11.367 --> 31:13.603
May I introduce myself?

31:13.737 --> 31:16.071
I'm Watson Pritchard.

31:16.205 --> 31:21.210
And in just a minute,
I'll show you the only really
haunted house in the world.

31:22.211 --> 31:23.847
Since it was built
a century ago,

31:23.979 --> 31:27.015
seven people, including my
brother, have been murdered.

31:39.662 --> 31:41.664
I'm Frederick Loren,

31:41.798 --> 31:44.133
and I've rented the house
on Haunted Hill tonight

31:44.266 --> 31:46.770
so that my wife
can give a party.

31:47.035 --> 31:50.205
A haunted house party.

31:50.372 --> 31:52.542
She's so amusing.

31:52.675 --> 31:56.311
There'll be food and drink
and ghosts

31:56.445 --> 31:58.782
and perhaps even
a few murders.

31:58.914 --> 32:00.850
You're all invited.

32:00.983 --> 32:03.986
If any of you will spend
the next 12 hours in this house,

32:04.119 --> 32:06.723
I'll give you each $10,000

32:06.856 --> 32:10.259
or your next of kin
in case you don't survive.

32:10.827 --> 32:14.229
Ah, but here come
our other guests.

32:17.065 --> 32:17.901
It was my wife's idea...

32:19.669 --> 32:21.504
...to have our guests come
in the funeral cars.

32:22.739 --> 32:24.774
- She's so amusing--
- JC it's us.

32:24.908 --> 32:26.876
Her sense of humor
is shall we say--

32:27.009 --> 32:28.778
Okay, coming.

32:28.912 --> 32:30.814
I dreamed up the hearse.
It's empty now.

32:30.946 --> 32:35.984
But after a night in the house
on Haunted Hill, who knows?

32:37.319 --> 32:40.255
It's Lance Schroeder,
a test pilot.

32:40.389 --> 32:42.324
No doubt a brave man.

32:42.458 --> 32:44.493
But don't you think you can be
much braver?

32:44.627 --> 32:45.662
Boo!

32:45.795 --> 32:48.197
And I haven't...

32:51.835 --> 32:52.968
...all night.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.471
This is Ruth Bridges...

32:55.605 --> 32:57.239
Hey, guys.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.209
You okay?

33:01.845 --> 33:03.813
- Hmm?
- Dude...

33:04.781 --> 33:06.482
Girl, did you get started
without us?

33:06.616 --> 33:07.884
-It was a little bit.
-I thought I smelled something!

33:11.353 --> 33:12.254
It was just a little.

33:12.387 --> 33:13.388
-Come on.
-Okay.

33:29.071 --> 33:31.975
Can someone make sure that
she didn't smoke everything.

33:32.909 --> 33:36.044
Yo seriously? I gave you this,
like, forever ago.

33:36.445 --> 33:38.146
I don't even know
if they're still good.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.214
I know. I know.

33:39.348 --> 33:41.483
I was saving them for, um...

33:43.018 --> 33:44.654
A special occasion.

33:46.321 --> 33:49.458
Yeah, I think this counts.

33:54.697 --> 33:58.835
Nice. You, uh... you pre-game
before the festival?

33:58.968 --> 34:00.269
What?

34:01.738 --> 34:03.171
The festival.

34:03.305 --> 34:04.774
The big Halloween blowout
they do every year.

34:04.908 --> 34:06.643
-You-- You going?
-No.

34:08.210 --> 34:09.244
Okay.

34:09.378 --> 34:10.947
It's, uh, $21.99.

34:11.079 --> 34:12.447
You got a rewards number
with us--

34:12.581 --> 34:13.583
Nope.

34:14.449 --> 34:15.918
I can save you 10%
if you just--

34:16.051 --> 34:19.087
If you don't let me buy this,
I'm going to steal it.

34:31.935 --> 34:33.002
Everybody's tired.

34:33.135 --> 34:34.469
Everybody's tired.

34:34.603 --> 34:36.906
And we all look over at JC,
and we're like,

34:37.040 --> 34:39.576
damn, this girl's like 6 seconds
away from passing out.

34:41.243 --> 34:42.679
We all expect her to go to bed,
but she's just laying there

34:42.812 --> 34:45.949
with her eyes
half open and she says,

34:46.081 --> 34:48.585
I'm going to go take a shower.

34:48.717 --> 34:50.553
I don't like going to bed
feeling dirty.

34:52.154 --> 34:53.856
And so we're all down here
and we hear the shower running

34:53.989 --> 34:55.558
for like 45 minutes.

34:55.692 --> 34:56.826
Oh, no.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.226
What are you doing in there
for 45 minutes?

34:59.562 --> 35:00.563
Knock on the door.

35:00.697 --> 35:03.533
We're like, "Yo, JC, you good".

35:03.666 --> 35:04.199
Nothing.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.436
We crack open the door,

35:07.570 --> 35:10.238
I go in, like
"Hey, I'm coming in!"

35:10.372 --> 35:12.207
And there she is,
fully clothed,

35:12.341 --> 35:14.043
lying on the floor
of the shower.

35:14.176 --> 35:15.778
I was tired.
I was tired.

35:15.912 --> 35:17.412
Like who goes in the shower,
fully clothed.

35:17.547 --> 35:18.982
And then is just like curls up
the floor--

35:19.114 --> 35:20.984
- Only JC.
- Only JC.

35:21.116 --> 35:22.919
That's something
only JC would do.

35:46.542 --> 35:51.213
Oh, look,
it's the Halloween, asshole.

36:00.957 --> 36:03.793
It's very, very cute.

36:07.162 --> 36:09.999
What, you want to compare
outfits?

36:26.716 --> 36:31.319
Um, so JC, you going
to the festival tonight?

36:31.453 --> 36:33.255
Oh, I'm...

36:33.756 --> 36:35.658
I don't know, I don't--
I don't think so.

36:35.792 --> 36:39.062
It's supposed to have a pretty
sweet fucking maze this year.

36:39.194 --> 36:40.897
Only if you're comfortable, Jay.

36:41.030 --> 36:43.066
You always go to this festival.

36:43.198 --> 36:44.600
It's like your thing.

36:44.734 --> 36:47.269
I mean, like, since your dad
took you every year?

36:47.402 --> 36:49.839
Like... you put us on to it!

36:50.205 --> 36:53.475
Yeah, I-- I know.

36:58.948 --> 37:00.917
I didn't...

37:01.050 --> 37:02.250
I'm sorry.

37:02.384 --> 37:04.153
It's just he took you
all the time.

37:04.286 --> 37:05.220
I just thought--

37:05.353 --> 37:06.622
No, no, it's fine. I understand.

37:06.756 --> 37:08.423
It's just, um...

37:12.628 --> 37:15.798
I don't know, sometimes
I feel like he's still here.

37:22.705 --> 37:24.807
Fuck it.

37:50.465 --> 37:52.267
Maybe he is.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.871
Even though my Nana passed,
I feel her, too.

37:55.004 --> 37:57.974
It's a comfort to know
she's still here with me.

37:59.609 --> 38:03.513
Yeah, comfort isn't the word
that I would use.

38:11.187 --> 38:12.989
Okay, is that it?

38:13.122 --> 38:14.557
We're done.

38:18.761 --> 38:20.263
I don't know.

38:20.395 --> 38:23.533
Maybe I'm just dreaming.

38:24.066 --> 38:26.869
I never really believed
in ghosts.

38:36.612 --> 38:39.882
I was in a lock-in once.

38:42.084 --> 38:43.451
What?

38:43.586 --> 38:45.655
I was with this group
of friends--

38:45.788 --> 38:48.925
Whoa, you have other friends?

38:50.026 --> 38:52.995
Yeah, It was in this abandoned
theater.

38:53.129 --> 38:54.797
Everyone thought it was haunted.

38:54.931 --> 38:58.167
And we spent the whole night
chasing around these, like,

38:58.301 --> 38:59.602
weird sounds.

38:59.735 --> 39:02.939
And the lights would just go,
like, on and off

39:03.072 --> 39:04.941
and on...

39:11.346 --> 39:13.182
And what?

39:13.316 --> 39:15.218
And nothing.

39:15.350 --> 39:17.987
It was just some homeless guy.

39:19.722 --> 39:21.924
What the fuck
was the point of that?

39:22.058 --> 39:24.293
Just that I don't believe
in ghosts either.

39:24.426 --> 39:25.628
And?

39:25.761 --> 39:26.596
And that, you know,
people will see

39:26.729 --> 39:28.164
what they want to see,

39:28.297 --> 39:30.333
and, you know, trick themselves
into believing it.

39:30.465 --> 39:32.535
Okay,
then what do you believe?

39:32.668 --> 39:34.604
Well,
I don't believe in ghosts.

39:34.737 --> 39:36.438
You know, like when you die,
that's it.

39:36.572 --> 39:39.108
That's the end.
There's... nothing.

39:44.881 --> 39:46.414
Oh, shit.
JC, I'm sorry.

39:46.549 --> 39:48.017
Actually, I just...

39:48.150 --> 39:49.585
JC?

39:49.719 --> 39:51.621
I just have to go to
the bathroom real quick.

39:53.823 --> 39:55.258
Great story, Liam.

39:55.390 --> 39:57.960
Yeah. Definitely tell it again.

41:31.486 --> 41:34.357
Jocelyn...

41:45.500 --> 41:46.836
It's not real.

41:46.969 --> 41:49.538
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real.

41:55.578 --> 41:57.446
Hey, you good?

41:57.580 --> 41:59.882
Yeah, I, um. I want to go.

42:00.016 --> 42:02.451
-Go where?
-To the festival.

42:02.585 --> 42:04.053
I want to go.

42:07.289 --> 42:08.524
Uh, are you sure?

42:08.657 --> 42:10.359
Yeah. I wanna go with you guys,
I just...

42:10.493 --> 42:13.529
I don't want to be here
anymore.

42:16.065 --> 42:19.201
-Okay. Well...
-Oh, fuck yes!

42:22.104 --> 42:24.173
Who's driving?

42:37.286 --> 42:38.487
Back the fuck off!

42:53.569 --> 42:56.205
Hey, I recognize you.

42:56.972 --> 43:00.076
You were at the cemetery.
You were...

43:01.744 --> 43:04.480
You were dancing.

43:04.847 --> 43:07.216
What the fuck do you want?

43:15.458 --> 43:18.360
Oh, fuck you.

43:19.061 --> 43:20.530
What are you going to do?

43:20.663 --> 43:23.065
You gonna cut me
with the piece of glass?

43:23.199 --> 43:25.868
Right here
in the fucking street?

43:26.502 --> 43:29.338
Okay! Do it then.

43:29.472 --> 43:30.706
Let's go.

43:32.141 --> 43:34.210
Don't just fucking stand there.

43:34.343 --> 43:35.244
Do something.

43:35.377 --> 43:37.179
Cut--
Cut me open!

43:38.180 --> 43:39.849
Do it!

45:22.652 --> 45:24.053
There it is! Up there.

45:24.186 --> 45:26.188
Come on!

45:39.235 --> 45:41.737
Yo, JC! You good?

45:41.870 --> 45:43.439
Yeah.

46:04.093 --> 46:05.995
Check it out.

46:06.362 --> 46:08.030
Who's coming?

46:12.801 --> 46:16.038
If you're not feeling it
we don't have to.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.842
I'm good.

46:19.975 --> 46:22.244
Really.

46:43.399 --> 46:44.734
Shit.

47:14.897 --> 47:16.700
Maddie!

48:28.937 --> 48:32.776
Hey! Hey! JC it's me, JC,

48:32.908 --> 48:36.546
It's me. JC! Stop!

48:39.649 --> 48:43.352
Hey, you okay?

48:43.986 --> 48:46.088
Dammit! JC, We should have known
this would be too much for you--

48:46.221 --> 48:50.426
He's gone! Maddie, he's gone,
he's really gone!

48:50.560 --> 48:53.863
-And I'm all alone.
-Hey, you're not all alone--

48:53.996 --> 48:56.833
First my mom.

48:56.965 --> 48:58.601
I was a kid.

49:00.202 --> 49:04.006
She did...
She did everything for us.

49:04.674 --> 49:07.376
She was my mom.

49:07.510 --> 49:09.044
I know.

49:09.178 --> 49:12.682
And now, I mean-- I just--

49:14.551 --> 49:20.322
They were my family--
and they're gone.

49:22.057 --> 49:27.463
You know, I thought maybe
I'd have a bit of family left.

49:28.297 --> 49:31.333
I don't know what I expected.

49:31.668 --> 49:34.169
Maybe that
she wanted to get to know

49:34.303 --> 49:39.441
me a little bit,
but I guess not.

49:44.714 --> 49:47.216
Maddie?

49:48.785 --> 49:51.688
Why can't I hold on
to my family?

49:52.689 --> 49:54.323
You've still got us, Jay.

49:54.456 --> 49:56.793
You've always got us.

50:13.510 --> 50:15.043
Sorry. We're closed.

50:15.177 --> 50:18.213
Entry door sensor.

50:21.183 --> 50:23.753
Oh, it's you again.

50:24.554 --> 50:25.788
Look, I--

50:25.922 --> 50:27.256
Oh, come on. Excuse me.

50:27.389 --> 50:30.125
I don't know how,
I just saw him.

50:30.259 --> 50:33.428
He cut himself, and he was,

50:33.563 --> 50:34.797
He was dead.

50:34.931 --> 50:36.699
What do you want?

50:37.332 --> 50:40.135
I watched him.

50:40.269 --> 50:43.573
Oh, too much Halloween for you.

50:43.907 --> 50:45.140
Let me ask you a question,

50:45.274 --> 50:47.744
you kill that whole bottle
by yourself?

50:49.244 --> 50:51.581
Hello?

50:51.714 --> 50:55.018
Look, I love the look,
Carrie, but

50:55.150 --> 50:57.687
if you don't get out of here,
I gotta call the cops.

51:00.523 --> 51:02.559
Okay.

51:25.447 --> 51:27.584
She said she would steal shit.

51:27.717 --> 51:29.786
Do you know if she did?

51:29.919 --> 51:33.088
I don't know. I can't be sure.

51:43.967 --> 51:44.968
How we doing tonight, ma'am?

51:45.100 --> 51:48.771
I, uh... I need some help.

51:48.905 --> 51:50.372
All right. Said you need help?

51:50.506 --> 51:52.542
Why don't you tell us
what's going on?

51:52.675 --> 51:55.011
Um, I saw a man,

51:55.143 --> 51:58.413
he was on the street, and he
killed himself in front of me.

51:58.548 --> 52:00.617
Okay. Okay.

52:00.750 --> 52:01.450
Are you hurt?

52:01.584 --> 52:03.987
No, He--
He-- he's--

52:04.119 --> 52:05.320
He stood up.

52:05.454 --> 52:08.558
He killed himself
and then he stood up.

52:08.691 --> 52:11.894
So the man that killed himself,
he came back to life again.

52:13.128 --> 52:14.697
I know how it sounds.

52:14.831 --> 52:18.601
No, no, it's okay. Um, can you
tell us what he looked like?

52:18.735 --> 52:20.168
Did you know him?

52:20.302 --> 52:25.875
He had a mask
and a suit and a top hat.

52:26.009 --> 52:27.442
I see.

52:27.577 --> 52:29.879
I think what we have here
is maybe a Halloween prank.

52:30.013 --> 52:31.514
No, no, no.

52:31.648 --> 52:34.117
Ma'am, it was probably
just some guy dressed up

52:34.249 --> 52:35.384
as this character to scare you.

52:35.518 --> 52:38.320
No, I know what I saw.

52:39.221 --> 52:41.524
A guy come back to life.

52:44.426 --> 52:46.696
When's the last time
you took something?

52:46.829 --> 52:50.099
'Cause we talked to the clerk,
and he said you bought a bottle?

52:50.232 --> 52:52.035
Maybe when you went outside,
you opened up that bottle,

52:52.167 --> 52:54.037
you take a couple of swigs?

52:54.169 --> 52:55.738
Oh, yeah, but--

52:55.872 --> 52:57.640
And have you had anything else
tonight?

52:57.774 --> 52:59.976
-What?
-Controlled substances?

53:00.109 --> 53:01.343
Weed, pills?

53:01.476 --> 53:03.278
-No, I'm not high.
-Big night for partying.

53:03.412 --> 53:04.781
I said I'm not fucking high!

53:04.914 --> 53:06.816
Okay, okay.

53:08.751 --> 53:10.586
Entry door sensor.

53:18.961 --> 53:21.831
Ma'am, are you sure
you're not injured?

53:23.166 --> 53:24.366
Ma'am?

53:24.499 --> 53:26.334
There's blood on you.
Are you bleeding?

53:26.468 --> 53:28.604
Hey, ma'am,
there's blood on you.

53:28.738 --> 53:30.540
Is it yours?

53:33.208 --> 53:34.844
Then where did it come from?

53:36.378 --> 53:37.780
Him.

53:40.083 --> 53:43.385
Is this the guy you saw earlier?

53:44.954 --> 53:46.221
Hey, buddy.

53:46.354 --> 53:48.891
You mind if we ask you some
questions?

53:52.227 --> 53:55.464
Did you see this woman earlier?

53:56.733 --> 53:58.000
All right.

53:58.134 --> 53:59.535
Why don't you cut it with
the cute little clown routine

53:59.669 --> 54:01.137
and take off the mask, huh?

54:17.319 --> 54:20.355
Hey, check that.

54:24.060 --> 54:25.895
Nothing.

54:26.028 --> 54:28.664
You want to take off the mask
so we can talk?

54:31.200 --> 54:33.502
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:51.319 --> 54:52.588
All right, buddy.

54:52.722 --> 54:54.223
We said earlier,
enough with the clown shit.

54:54.356 --> 54:56.458
Come on.

55:01.097 --> 55:02.364
All right, buddy, outside.

55:02.497 --> 55:04.033
- Come on. Halloween's over.
- Hey!

55:04.167 --> 55:07.537
What the fuck?

55:09.038 --> 55:09.705
What the fuck!?

55:10.573 --> 55:11.707
Oh, shit!

55:11.841 --> 55:14.010
What the fuck!?
What the fuck?!

55:15.278 --> 55:17.880
Get off of me! Get off me!

55:20.983 --> 55:22.450
Get off me! Get off me!

55:22.585 --> 55:24.452
What the fuck is that!?

55:30.392 --> 55:31.794
Oh, shit.

55:31.928 --> 55:33.963
What the fuck!?

56:36.125 --> 56:37.860
Oh, my God.

57:12.194 --> 57:13.029
I'm sorry, miss.

57:13.162 --> 57:14.330
I'm all out.

57:14.462 --> 57:16.299
- Do you have cherry?
- Yeah.

57:16.431 --> 57:17.833
-Strawberry?
-Come on.

57:17.967 --> 57:19.702
We need to take JC home,
Alexis.

57:19.835 --> 57:21.337
-Grape.
-Please?

57:21.469 --> 57:22.772
Out.

57:22.905 --> 57:24.173
-Lex, you're not listening.
-What's in there?

57:24.307 --> 57:25.741
-Oh, that's blue raspberry.
-Alexis, please!

57:25.875 --> 57:26.842
Okay, so can I get some blue
raspberry?

57:26.976 --> 57:28.344
We need to take her home now.

57:28.476 --> 57:29.679
We're out of blue raspberry
also.

57:29.812 --> 57:31.047
-What!?
-I'm really worried, Alexis!

57:31.180 --> 57:32.682
You're out
of the only thing you have?

57:35.117 --> 57:36.919
Why does she have to do
this right now?

57:40.289 --> 57:42.858
Why don't you just let
her get something to eat?

57:42.992 --> 57:46.963
I'm just thinking maybe
we should start heading home.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.969
Yeah, maybe we could head out.

57:53.102 --> 57:55.571
Then why in God's
green fucking earth are you
still open?

57:55.705 --> 57:57.974
Alexis.

57:58.908 --> 58:01.310
Keep an eye on her.

58:22.398 --> 58:23.399
Hey, JC--

58:58.034 --> 58:59.268
Dad?

59:08.677 --> 59:10.346
Yeah, I'm not using it.

59:33.969 --> 59:36.939
Not bad.

59:39.175 --> 59:40.309
Hey, excuse me.

59:40.443 --> 59:44.180
Evil Witch, have you seen
my daughter, Jocelyn?

59:44.313 --> 59:45.247
Don't worry, Daddy.

59:45.381 --> 59:47.983
It's me. I'm right here.

59:48.117 --> 59:49.652
Oh, my God.

01:00:00.362 --> 01:00:02.298
What?

01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:04.934
What the fuck?

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.339
My teeth!

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.641
My fucking teeth!

01:00:15.644 --> 01:00:18.481
There you are.

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:21.250
Where have you been,
little lady?

01:00:21.383 --> 01:00:22.818
Getting candy.

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:41.103
No!

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:55.117
I wanna know
why the lights are still on.

01:01:19.074 --> 01:01:20.510
Daddy?

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:22.512
Daddy?!

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:24.581
No! Daddy?!

01:01:24.713 --> 01:01:25.981
Don't go! Daddy!

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:29.151
Daddy, come back, come back!

01:01:35.357 --> 01:01:36.560
What the fuck?

01:01:36.725 --> 01:01:38.494
What the fuck?

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:41.665
JC! JC, what are you doing?

01:01:41.897 --> 01:01:43.832
JC, Liam got
his fucking eyes taken out.

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.569
I don't know
what the fuck is happening.

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:47.703
Please, just turn around.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:48.971
Turn around!

01:01:49.104 --> 01:01:50.105
What are you doing?

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:51.440
JC, please.

01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:53.042
Please.

01:01:53.842 --> 01:01:55.311
His teeth are gone!

01:01:55.444 --> 01:01:56.178
What the fuck?

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.079
What the fuck!?

01:01:59.114 --> 01:02:01.417
Oh, my God!

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.061
JC, don't.

01:02:12.194 --> 01:02:13.395
JC, run!

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:14.698
Just get out of--

01:02:28.844 --> 01:02:30.346
Please, let them go.

01:02:30.479 --> 01:02:33.282
I'll do anything you want.
Please.

01:02:33.415 --> 01:02:35.484
Please just let them go.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:36.720
I'll do whatever you want.

01:02:36.852 --> 01:02:39.288
Just let them go.

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:16.158
Mom?

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:19.061
Hi, sweetie.
Are you okay?

01:03:19.194 --> 01:03:20.262
No.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.865
Oh. What's wrong?

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.935
Wait. Why are you calling?

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:30.372
Oh, sweetie, you know,
Mommy's always here for you.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:33.809
Is my little girl afraid
of the Jester?

01:03:33.942 --> 01:03:35.210
What?

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:36.879
He's really not so bad.

01:03:37.012 --> 01:03:39.683
He just wants to show you
the truth.

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:41.685
How do you know?

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.452
You know, you wouldn't be
in this situation

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:45.921
if you weren't so difficult
all the time.

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:47.823
Mom, what are you talking about?

01:03:47.956 --> 01:03:49.258
Oh, Emma.

01:03:49.391 --> 01:03:51.160
Don't pretend
like you don't know.

01:03:51.293 --> 01:03:52.961
It's hard for people
to get along with you.

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:55.064
I mean, can you blame them?

01:03:55.197 --> 01:03:57.399
You're not a very likable
person.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:03:58.367
What?

01:04:02.237 --> 01:04:04.239
It's like I always say:

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:07.476
"A little more smiling
goes a long, long way."

01:04:10.979 --> 01:04:14.116
But no matter
how many times I say it,

01:04:14.249 --> 01:04:17.554
I just can't seem
to get through that thick

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:20.189
skull of yours.

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:26.629
But I suppose you got that
from your father.

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:33.035
What the fuck
do you want with me?

01:04:33.268 --> 01:04:36.506
Now, that's no way
to talk to your mother.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.676
Fuck you.

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:41.811
Excuse you,
Miss Potty Mouth!

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:45.347
I'll bet you Jocelyn never
speaks to her mother like that.

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:50.386
Well, that's if she could
still speak to her.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.229
Poor little Jocelyn.

01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:03.767
She did try to connect
with you, you know.

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:07.035
She made an effort.

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:09.639
Such a shame.

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:11.140
Where did you get that?

01:05:11.273 --> 01:05:14.476
She was such a good girl.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:15.978
What do you mean "was"?

01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:17.913
What did you do to her?

01:05:18.046 --> 01:05:20.949
Now, why would you care
about a thing like that?

01:05:21.116 --> 01:05:23.720
About Daddy's little girl?

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:27.524
No, that's not like you, Emma.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.057
Where is she?

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:31.561
You never cared about her.
Why start now?

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:34.664
Just tell me
what you did to her.

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:39.569
Emma, you can always make
the same choice he did.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:42.705
Just leave.

01:05:42.938 --> 01:05:44.574
You're free to go.

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.876
Jocelyn is a member of a family
you never knew.

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:50.479
Soon to be forgotten.
Leave now, sweetie.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.583
And over time, the events of
tonight will feel like a dream

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:56.318
half remembered.

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:03.560
Or...

01:06:06.328 --> 01:06:08.997
...we can keep playing.

01:06:24.179 --> 01:06:26.683
I'm not leaving without her.

01:06:28.283 --> 01:06:29.886
You know,

01:06:30.018 --> 01:06:32.488
I always thought you could learn
a thing or two from Jocelyn.

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.692
At least Daddy
got one thing right, didn't he?

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:11.393
John...

01:07:12.127 --> 01:07:14.096
No, no, John... Please.

01:07:14.229 --> 01:07:16.866
John please. Please.
Talk to me, please.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.935
I tried talking.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:22.906
I called you that night,
and I wanted to talk then,

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:26.809
but you pushed me away,
rejected me, left me alone.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:34.383
I know you know what you did.

01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:37.787
You abandoned a broken man.

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:40.924
I reached out to you
for a connection, a lifeline,

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:43.458
to mend something broken.

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:46.763
Dad.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.865
I know you know what you did.

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.833
And I know that
you're now using that anger

01:07:50.967 --> 01:07:53.135
that you feel towards me
to cover up for something

01:07:53.268 --> 01:07:55.605
deeper, deep inside your gut.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:59.008
It is festering, feeding,
gnawing at you.

01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:00.743
I know you can feel it.

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:04.681
You try to bury it,
but that rot is spreading.

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:08.551
A decaying hole,
swallowing your heart.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:10.553
No.

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:12.722
Oh, no, no, no.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:14.691
Please.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:20.796
You know
you're the reason I'm dead.

01:09:16.618 --> 01:09:18.420
JC?

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.658
JC?

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:30.533
Are you lost, too?

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:35.571
I-- I don't know.

01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:39.609
Who are you?

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.844
Jocelyn.

01:09:41.978 --> 01:09:43.680
Have you seen my dad?

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:46.849
He's gone. And he left me here.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.721
You're...

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:54.057
You're not real.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.893
He left me here all alone.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.294
All by myself.

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:04.366
You're not real.

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:09.471
I am real.

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:11.040
I'm the real daughter.

01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:12.207
You're not.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.476
You're make believe.

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:18.881
You're not real.

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:25.021
Daddy says you were never real.

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:27.322
He said you were a mistake.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:30.258
And that I was what
you can never be.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.695
That's why you have to help me
find him.

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:35.698
-Otherwise--
-Fuck off!

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:42.064
Yes. We've got to get it
all out.

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:43.900
Good job honey, good job.

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:45.968
Oh, I know.

01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:47.570
It's gross.

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:50.273
Put a candle in there.

01:11:50.405 --> 01:11:53.341
Got to get a candle.

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:03.986
I suppose this is something
you never wanted to see.

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:08.423
An intimate glimpse at a life
you never had yourself.

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:17.432
There's something you
have to understand, Emma.

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.168
I didn't hate you.

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:22.672
I didn't.
I just didn't want you.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:23.940
And I tried.

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.174
I really did.

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:26.676
But I was too young.

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:29.312
And I made a mistake.

01:12:29.444 --> 01:12:32.715
One you never forgave me for.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.985
What, was I supposed to pay
for that mistake

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:38.521
for the rest of my life?

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:42.592
You know,
you hated me for leaving,

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:45.027
when, in fact,
my one true mistake

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:47.163
was ever having you
in the first place.

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:48.664
Stop.

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:51.000
You see, I became the father
I was meant to be.

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:53.336
Just not with you.

01:12:53.468 --> 01:12:56.739
And you couldn't let that go.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:57.807
JC...

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.609
I had everything I could want.

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:03.411
A loving wife.
A perfect daughter. Real family.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.915
One that I felt I could never
fully give myself

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:10.452
to because I had you
hanging over my head.

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:11.888
You're always out there,
somewhere,

01:13:12.021 --> 01:13:15.024
preventing me from being happy.

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:20.663
Somehow you managed to rob me
of the privilege of fatherhood.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:24.300
It was too much.

01:13:24.432 --> 01:13:26.769
The weight of it.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:52.862
Why are you crying?

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.897
Didn't my death give you
the closure

01:13:55.031 --> 01:13:57.400
you so desperately needed, huh?

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:58.701
Or is it the fact that

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:01.070
you're the one responsible
for it.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:09.145
You feel it now, too,
don't you?

01:14:10.313 --> 01:14:12.014
The weight.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:16.052
JC, please.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.690
Aw, what's the matter?

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:24.226
Are Daddy's words
too much for you?

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.030
This is exactly the reason
why I reached out to you.

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:30.066
I pitied you.

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:33.336
I did it more for me
than anyone else.

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:35.871
And then seeing you
at the funeral?

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:41.476
Jesus, you looked so pathetic
standing there all alone.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:49.418
I have to admit,
part of me felt good

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:52.355
seeing that you were so low.

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.190
So what now, sis?

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:57.259
You lost your opportunity
to mend your relationship

01:14:57.393 --> 01:14:59.128
with him.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:02.031
And now you will never get
that chance again.

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:06.135
Is this what you have to look
forward to?

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:08.938
Forever?

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:10.973
You have nothing.

01:15:11.107 --> 01:15:12.875
You form no meaningful
connection

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:18.881
with anyone and to everyone
in your life you are a burden.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:24.553
Don't allow yourself to burden
me the same way

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:26.122
that you burdened him.

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:29.258
If you have one act of kindness
left in you,

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:32.962
please end the suffering.

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.031
For everyone.

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:53.949
Wake up.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.523
Emma, wake up.

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.227
You're not real.

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:19.543
Oh, JC! Oh, God! JC!
Oh, God!

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:24.346
JC, JC! Can you hear me?

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:30.453
Please, oh, God!

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:33.422
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.693
I knew...

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:42.665
I knew you were asleep.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:49.004
Keep talking.
Hey, keep talking.

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:51.373
Keep talking,
J.C. Please, please, please.

01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:52.408
No, no, no, no.

01:16:52.542 --> 01:16:53.776
Don't leave me!

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:56.412
It's all my fault,
I'm so sorry...

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:05.921
Stay! Away! From her!

01:17:08.424 --> 01:17:10.560
I don't know
where you came from...

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:12.862
...and I don't care.

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:16.365
I know exactly what you are.

01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:20.336
You're a sickness.

01:17:28.612 --> 01:17:30.279
Do what you want to me.

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:33.782
I'm not running anymore.

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:37.319
But you stay the fuck
away from her.

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:47.062
Hey,
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:50.499
I'm so sorry,
you didn't deserve any of this.

01:17:50.634 --> 01:17:52.668
It's gonna be okay.

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:58.107
I'm not going anywhere, okay?
I'm here.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:02.978
JC? JC?

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:08.050
Help! Somebody help us!

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:10.719
Help us! Somebody help!

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.922
Help!

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:19.061
The show's in Baltimore?

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:20.630
Yep.

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:22.532
That's a bit of a drive,
isn't it?

01:18:22.666 --> 01:18:23.567
It's not that bad.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.434
Plus, I wanted to see JC.

01:18:25.569 --> 01:18:29.038
Yeah, I know. So...

01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:32.942
Got your eye on the next gig
after this one?

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:36.078
Uh, no, not really.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:39.081
Nothing?

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:42.519
Actually, I was planning
on coming to see you.

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:45.555
Oh, I suppose that'll be fine.

01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:49.593
You know, I'd like that very
much, Emmy.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.228
Yeah, me too.

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:53.495
Okay.

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:55.331
Give JC my love, will you?

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.366
I will.

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:58.834
I love you, Mom.

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:01.170
- Love you.
- Bye.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:23.492
There's some things
I need to say to you.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.895
Some things
maybe I should have said.

01:19:28.632 --> 01:19:34.236
I should have talked to you
that night.

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:41.277
I should have talked to you.

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:47.349
But, what happened...

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:50.587
It's not my fault.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.257
And I-- I can't keep putting
that on myself.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:01.030
You made your own choices, John.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.937
I think deep down, I-- I--

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:12.575
I always knew
there was this door.

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:17.980
And I think
I had this dream that...

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:21.518
that one day we might actually
have a relationship.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:28.190
That's all it ever was.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:31.460
Was a dream.

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:38.934
And it just really,
really hurt

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:42.338
that you closed that door
forever.

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:54.083
Regardless of how I feel
about it, I, uh...

01:20:55.785 --> 01:20:58.087
I'm your blood.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.490
And the sickness that
was in you...

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:05.094
It's in me.

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:09.198
Some days are worse than others.

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:13.268
But I always feel it.

01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:16.740
Every day.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.475
It's here.

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:23.546
But I'm not going to make
your mistakes.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.080
I can't.

01:21:25.849 --> 01:21:28.384
I'm still here.

01:21:28.518 --> 01:21:33.956
You made your own choices,
and I'm going to make mine.

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.926
You did right by her, though.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:40.996
There'd be no her without you.

01:21:42.665 --> 01:21:46.636
And,
she has so much good in her.

01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:49.506
She's stronger than I ever
gave her credit for.

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:53.942
And I have a lot
to learn from her.

01:21:57.847 --> 01:22:01.283
And if she got any of that
from you...

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:05.921
...and you left her with me,

01:22:06.823 --> 01:22:11.661
then I guess you gave us
everything we needed.
