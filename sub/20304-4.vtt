NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.670 --> 00:05.964
Frank Furillo, you got a detective

00:06.673 --> 00:10.552
who puts the squeeze
to 15-year-old prostitutes.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.804
How do you know he was telling the truth?

00:14.055 --> 00:15.598
He was right about Mort Sanders.

00:15.932 --> 00:18.727
If there's even one bad egg up here,
I want him found out and gotten rid of.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.271
Captain, I'd like an assignment
with Detective Belker.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.482
Four whole days
giving some Hollywood dirtbag

00:24.566 --> 00:26.609
a Girl Scout tour of this precinct?

00:26.901 --> 00:28.236
It's the Bahamas, you jerk.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.947
This job thing's got to you,
hasn't it, Neal?

00:31.031 --> 00:35.118
Councilman Detweiler, you're under arrest
for driving while intoxicated.

00:36.828 --> 00:40.206
One more time, and I don't give a damn
if the governor himself phones,

00:40.290 --> 00:41.916
I'm pushing you
straight through the system.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.210
They wanna operate right away.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.378
Is there anything I can do, Howard?

00:45.462 --> 00:47.088
I'm a little afraid, Frank.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.466
Goldblume bedded her
instead of busting her.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.260
Save you some trouble
with the chief anyway.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.845
Police! Freeze!

00:54.721 --> 00:57.265
NARRATOR:
<i>And now tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:57.348 --> 00:59.934
-Happy birthday, cowboy.
-Ooh.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.103
(camera shutter clicking)

01:02.187 --> 01:03.271
I don't believe it.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.940
-Councilman Detweiler.
-Third baseline.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.735
Just my way of saying
keep up the good work.

01:08.818 --> 01:11.362
Do you think
it would be terribly forward of me

01:11.446 --> 01:13.531
to tell you how attracted I am to you?

01:13.615 --> 01:18.453
Sick male patients frequently develop
an emotional fixation for their nurse.

01:18.536 --> 01:22.457
-You know Henry Goldblume?
-I get people wanting freebies all day.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.834
I take full responsibility
for Henry Goldblume.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.877
Meaning what?

01:26.211 --> 01:29.672
Meaning if you take his badge and gun,
you'll find mine in the same envelope.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.802
-PHIL:<i> Item ten.</i>
-ANDY:<i> Yeah, the weather.</i>

01:34.677 --> 01:38.306
Today's anticipated high, 103 degrees.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.724
(all oohing)

01:39.808 --> 01:41.476
Of course, those of you
who edify yourselves

01:41.559 --> 01:44.312
with the A.M. television news
are aware of the picture.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.524
The most beautiful picture
this crusted desk sergeant

01:47.607 --> 01:50.235
has had the pleasure of viewing
from a weather satellite.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.822
-Cumulus clouds.
-(all cheering)

01:54.239 --> 01:57.450
Cool, Canadian cumulus clouds.

01:57.534 --> 02:01.788
Fluffy white billows of angel hair
pregnant with moisture

02:01.871 --> 02:04.207
due to arrive this late P.M.!

02:04.290 --> 02:05.416
(cheering)

02:05.500 --> 02:07.752
PHIL: Be advised,
there is a cautionary addendum.

02:07.836 --> 02:12.048
Said clouds have the possibility
of passing in the night like felons

02:12.590 --> 02:14.759
without giving us
as much as a day's shade.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.222
Item 11. And I want you all to look
for the moral in this.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.891
It seems our space cadet,
Mr. Smith of Jefferson Avenue,

02:21.975 --> 02:23.309
has been found here on Earth.

02:23.685 --> 02:27.605
A, uh, transferal form,
half of which was incorrectly filled out,

02:27.689 --> 02:29.065
half of which was left blank,

02:29.357 --> 02:31.484
caused the suspect
to be placed erroneously

02:31.568 --> 02:35.321
on a bus for the Hutchison white-collar
lockup in the country.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.866
-(laughing)
-PHIL: Mr. Smith's unlawful incarceration

02:37.949 --> 02:41.411
was discovered only after he signed up
for the bridge tournament.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.495
(laughing)

02:42.579 --> 02:45.206
Be aware, this story may very well
have had a different ending

02:45.290 --> 02:47.584
had the suspect
been instead the triple murderer

02:47.667 --> 02:49.919
put away by this precinct last month.

02:50.879 --> 02:55.300
The homily goes, the job isn't over
until the paperwork's done.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.136
And you all
had better start living with it,

02:58.428 --> 03:01.264
or else you'll find yourself
being replaced by student officers

03:01.347 --> 03:05.018
within whom I am imbuing the necessity
of bureaucratic detail!

03:05.393 --> 03:08.188
And with that, I conclude the items
on this morning's agenda.

03:09.230 --> 03:13.234
But I would please like you to hold
your seats for a few personal notes.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.485
MAN: Sarge, it's hot!

03:15.820 --> 03:19.657
Lt. Hunter was admitted to Mercy Hospital
yesterday afternoon.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.494
The exact nature of the malady
is unknown to this podium.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.956
But even as we speak,
Lt. Hunter is on the operating table.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.751
The front desk is closely monitoring
the situation

03:30.293 --> 03:33.463
and will keep the squad room informed
as news develops.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.714
In the meantime,

03:35.381 --> 03:40.011
let's send the lieutenant all our prayers
and best wishes for a speedy recovery.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.179
-Yeah.
-Hear! Hear!

03:42.138 --> 03:44.182
On a more celebratory note,

03:44.265 --> 03:47.560
the birthday wagon is amongst us today.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.730
Officer Andrew Renko.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.482
-(speaking indistinctly)
-I didn't say anything.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.401
PHIL: And from the same secret source,
Officer Renko's sister,

03:55.485 --> 03:57.654
I have acquired
certain historical information

03:57.737 --> 04:00.949
of that glad occasion
of so many years ago.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.326
Time of birth, 4:04 a.m.,

04:03.409 --> 04:06.287
-weight, ten pounds, one ounce.
-(all oohing)

04:06.371 --> 04:09.123
Distinguishing characteristics,
enormous feet.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.459
(laughing)

04:11.542 --> 04:13.795
He went home with mother
the following day.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.090
Happy birthday, Andy.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.133
-(cheering)
-Happy birthday! All right!

04:20.593 --> 04:22.637
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.347
And, hey, hey, hey!

04:25.598 --> 04:26.975
Let's be careful out there.

04:30.770 --> 04:34.399
If a man hasn't made his mark
by the time he's 35, it's all over.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.944
All right, Renko, I'm taking you to lunch
today at the CafÃ© Bardeau.

04:38.194 --> 04:42.490
It was gonna be a surprise, but sounds
like you might do yourself in before noon.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.867
-What do you mean by lunch?
-Lunch, food, eat.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.538
If this is gonna be a surprise party,
I cannot take it, not on this day.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.081
Congratulations.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.460
Happy birthday, cowboy. Ooh, older men.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.879
Happy birthday, cowboy!

04:56.963 --> 04:59.090
You know,
this is rapidly becoming a situation

04:59.173 --> 05:01.676
of public amusement, and I am not amused!

05:01.759 --> 05:03.928
I only hope that people treat me
as nice as they treat you

05:04.012 --> 05:06.014
-when I'm your age, sweetheart.
-My age!

05:06.097 --> 05:08.474
Hey, Renko, I got you this.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.560
A pictorial history of the Super Bowl.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.104
Ninety-four pictures, ten in color.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.773
A guy should sit down
right on his birthday.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.859
Well, at least
there's one person in this group

05:17.942 --> 05:20.278
that understands the nature
of a personal gift.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.529
Thank you, Leo.

05:22.196 --> 05:23.531
Hey, birthday boy, don't forget,

05:23.614 --> 05:25.908
the job ain't over
till the paperwork's done!

05:26.576 --> 05:28.870
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:29.245 --> 05:30.955
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:31.039 --> 05:34.834
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:34.917 --> 05:36.502
(sirens wailing)

05:41.966 --> 05:45.887
(theme music playing)

06:47.240 --> 06:48.616
(alarm ringing)

07:04.006 --> 07:05.299
-Did you load the camera, babe?
-Mm-hmm.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.218
DISPATCH:<i> All units, vicinity 900 block,</i>

07:07.301 --> 07:09.262
<i>there's a store alarm. Possible 459.</i>

07:09.345 --> 07:10.346
Hey, we're on the air.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.682
MAN:<i> This is unit 2214.</i>

07:12.765 --> 07:14.183
<i>-We'll take the call.</i>
-DISPATCH:<i> Roger...</i>

07:14.267 --> 07:15.560
-Coley and Lyle?
-Yeah.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.563
-J.D.: Doesn't it bother you, Neal?
-What?

07:18.855 --> 07:21.732
-Spying on cops.
-You don't foul your own nest, babe.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.318
Hey, man,
I've been on the other side of this thing.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.903
It's not so black and white.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.614
(alarm continues)

07:36.247 --> 07:40.793
(scoffs) Coley and Lyle,
a couple of choir boys, for God's sake.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.212
(J.D. sighs)

07:47.216 --> 07:51.095
Man, it must be 120 degrees in here, Neal.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.638
-What do you say?
-Hey, cool it, babe.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.441
Uh, about this Bahamas thing,
you going or what?

08:03.774 --> 08:05.526
Hey, J.D., man, I told you when I know
about it,

08:05.610 --> 08:07.111
-you'll know about it.
-Okay, okay.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.281
Coley's out.

08:15.536 --> 08:16.412
(shutter clicks)

08:20.500 --> 08:24.420
(shutter clicking)

08:27.089 --> 08:27.924
(J.D. sighs)

08:31.427 --> 08:33.137
Man, I don't believe it.

08:38.476 --> 08:39.435
This is unit 22.

08:40.853 --> 08:41.687
Oh, Ray,

08:42.438 --> 08:44.899
the prostitute in the Goldblume situation,
do you have an address?

08:44.982 --> 08:47.443
-An approximate address.
-I want her in here right away.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.530
Officer Robert Hill,
where can I find him, please?

08:51.113 --> 08:53.282
Uh, third desk against the wall.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.535
-Here you go, Councilman.
-Thank you.

09:04.919 --> 09:05.753
Officer Hill.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.297
Councilman Detweiler.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.217
-You look like a man that likes baseball.
-I do?

09:12.009 --> 09:17.014
I've had a season box
for about eight years, third baseline.

09:17.723 --> 09:21.060
I've got city business
and, uh, such an important game,

09:21.143 --> 09:22.478
it'd be a shame to waste them.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.731
-You and a lady friend?
-I'm sorry. I can't accept them.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.777
Officer Hill, I appreciate character,

09:29.860 --> 09:32.238
but I also applaud spunk when I see it.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.907
And I want to tell you
that I approve 100 percent

09:34.991 --> 09:37.868
of the way you handled
our little misunderstanding the other day.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.372
So I thought we could settle it
like a couple of old allies.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.041
Case closed.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.004
You're a good cop, Robert, you know.
You're on the best force in the country.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.674
It's people like you that keep us voting
those high appropriations.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.635
-Thank you.
-So take the tickets.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.929
Just my way of saying
keep up the good work.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.689
I finally got this thing to work.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.149
-It-- it was the battery.
-Let's go.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.818
I thought because it was made
by them Nipponese people

10:10.901 --> 10:13.362
that it wouldn't work,
but the reason it didn't work

10:13.446 --> 10:15.406
was because it didn't have the battery.

10:17.950 --> 10:18.784
FRANK: Mick!

10:27.960 --> 10:29.712
-This for the drug buy?
-Yes, sir.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.505
Run it down for me.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.594
We meet this afternoon,
uh, do a little flexing.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.013
-No action at the meet?
-No, there shouldn't be.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.350
I'll show him the money,
he'll tell me he doesn't have the stuff,

10:42.433 --> 10:44.685
we'll hondle for a little bit,
we'll set it up for tonight.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.770
Take Gennaro with you.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.024
Captain, you're making me nuts!

10:50.107 --> 10:52.318
I'm just passing on
an order from the chief.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.987
You know, you sort of have to admire him.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.990
Juicing up Daniels like that,
showing up at 5:30.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.662
-A.M.?
-That's what the night man told Leo.

11:06.165 --> 11:06.999
Yes, sir.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.770
-Hey, morning, Mick.
-Morning.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.608
Look, uh, about last night.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.070
You know, I get--
Sometimes I get wound up.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.156
I mean to say one thing,
and it comes out like something else.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.535
I was just trying to say
how grateful I was.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.833
Hey, I got something for you.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.517
I was walking by the Front Street Market,
you know.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.188
That's very thoughtful.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.233
This ought to do it. Just sign right here.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.738
This is a game, you know, between me
and the insurance companies, that's all.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.322
Nobody stops the criminals.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.575
I just keep paying higher premiums

12:22.658 --> 12:24.952
for the privilege of getting robbed
every three months.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.747
COLEY: Lucky for you you're only down
a couple of VCRs.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.291
Maybe you'll get lucky
and catch the guys who did this.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.251
-Do you think we like it like this?
-This stinks.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.377
Heat wave like this?

12:33.461 --> 12:36.464
We got cops home sick, out on vacation,
tied up in court.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.008
We're doing good
to get six units out on the street.

12:39.091 --> 12:42.511
And in the winter it's too cold,
the rainy season it's too wet.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.639
All I know is the crooks are too dumb
to pay any attention to the weather.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.683
-Are we done here or what?
-We sure are.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.394
If I were you,
I'd get that door fixed right away.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.354
Yeah, there's a locksmith
across the street.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.940
I'm putting his kid through Harvard.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.485
Lyle and I rode together for a month
when we were rookies.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.571
You know, one time I saw him
go through two dumpsters and a grease rack

13:00.654 --> 13:03.324
to get to a cat burglar, can you beat it?
Can you beat that?

13:13.751 --> 13:14.710
Do we bust 'em now?

13:15.252 --> 13:17.630
No. Let's wait and see where they dump it.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.768
Frank!

13:35.022 --> 13:38.275
-Coley and Lyle?
-LaRue and Washington are still on it.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.830
-Diane Koslow?
-Fifteen years old, maybe.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.249
We found her working
on 133rd Street and Dekker.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.793
Good work, Joe.
Ray, let's see if we can find out

13:55.876 --> 13:58.629
if Joyce Davenport is still in conference
with her arsonist.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.172
-I'll be there in a minute.
-All right.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.550
Captain, any word on Lt. Hunter?

14:02.967 --> 14:05.219
Well, he's out of surgery,
but we won't have a report on the biopsy

14:05.302 --> 14:06.303
for a couple of hours.

14:06.762 --> 14:07.596
Thank you.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.030
They can't make you stay here
if you want to leave, Diane.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.908
Nor can they force you
to answer any questions you don't want to.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.368
It's entirely up to you.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.413
And I'll be here if you're unsure
about anything, all right?

14:32.997 --> 14:33.831
Okay.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.292
Do you know Henry Goldblume?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.420
Yeah. I guess, sort of.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.215
There are stories coming out
of the Jefferson Heights Police Precinct

14:43.299 --> 14:45.050
that you know him a lot better
than just sort of.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.095
Hey, look, I don't have to be here.
She said so.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.598
So why don't you just leave me alone?

14:50.973 --> 14:53.684
Henry resigned yesterday
after ten years on this police force.

14:53.767 --> 14:57.021
The reason he resigned was these rumors
that he'd been sleeping with you.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.943
It's not too late to save his career,
but only you can do that.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.112
Well, what about my case?

15:05.696 --> 15:07.281
Can you help me with my case?

15:07.364 --> 15:11.035
Diane, Captain Furillo's position
is that he can't offer you any deals

15:11.118 --> 15:13.829
because he doesn't want to encourage you
to tell anything but the truth.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.249
You know,
I get people wanting freebies all day.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.753
I think Ms. Koslow
doesn't wish to speak any longer.

15:21.045 --> 15:24.048
Diane, Henry helped you.
He listened to you.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.383
He fed you and sheltered you
and did everything he could

15:26.467 --> 15:28.344
to get you into the best program
in the city.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.803
Are you gonna abandon him now?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.515
Are you gonna treat him the same way
your parents treated you?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.225
Is that how you pay back
one of the few people

15:35.309 --> 15:36.685
who have ever been kind to you?

15:37.561 --> 15:38.812
Don't abandon him.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.107
At least give him the same consideration
he gave you.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.277
Did you sleep with him? Did you?

15:48.155 --> 15:50.491
Then when you were picked up
the second time in Jefferson Heights,

15:50.574 --> 15:52.368
why did you tell the detectives you did?

15:53.702 --> 15:56.121
Because I spent the whole night in jail.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.458
He should have come down and gotten me
if he was my friend.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.172
He wouldn't even talk to me.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.177
It would mean a lot
if you'd give a statement.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.554
(sniffles)

16:16.684 --> 16:18.185
He was really nice to me.

16:20.646 --> 16:24.608
I just slept on the couch.
He didn't touch me once.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.536
Ray, Ms. Koslow
will give us a statement now.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.329
I haven't gotten through to Henry yet.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.290
It's all right. Just keep trying.
Rachel's, his apartment, everywhere.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.129
ANDY: Well, whip my wire.
I cannot believe this.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.548
Two play-off tickets for tonight

16:47.631 --> 16:48.757
-right behind the dugout.
-That's right.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.092
I cannot believe this.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.011
This must have set you back
60 bucks, partner.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.388
A mere flesh wound, my man.
Happy birthday.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.807
Happy birthday to me.
We're gonna have a ball.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.684
-But I can't go.
-You can't go?

16:58.767 --> 17:01.437
-No, I have a date tonight.
-Will you look at this.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.940
35 going on 50, in a one-way job

17:05.024 --> 17:08.318
and a roach-hole apartment
going up to 500 bills next month

17:08.861 --> 17:10.654
and a checking account
on the disabled list

17:10.738 --> 17:12.239
and I can't even get my partner

17:12.322 --> 17:14.158
-to be my date on my birthday.
-No, you're not getting older,

17:14.241 --> 17:15.909
you're getting downright maudlin.

17:19.079 --> 17:19.913
Whoops.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.583
-The woman is looking at you again.
-What are you talking about?

17:22.666 --> 17:24.043
-She's not looking at me.
-She is.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.879
She is not. She's probably just waiting
for somebody. Now be quiet.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.840
You know what your problem is, Renko?
A bad attitude.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.301
-If you lost a little weight--
-Don't talk to me about my weight!

17:32.384 --> 17:33.886
And got some decent clothes,

17:33.969 --> 17:35.929
you'd have to fight the ladies off
with a nightstick.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.931
-Excuse me, Officer Hill?
-Yeah.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.225
We have a phone call for you
at the front desk.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.394
I left this number with the dispatch.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.480
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.660
-Excuse me, Officer.
-What?

17:59.369 --> 18:01.121
I'd like to report a misdemeanor.

18:02.915 --> 18:03.749
You mean, to me?

18:04.875 --> 18:07.753
Aside from your partner,
I don't see any other uniforms in here.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.714
Well, I guess you're right, ma'am.
What is the nature of the complaint?

18:11.215 --> 18:13.383
How about breach of contract for starters?

18:13.842 --> 18:15.385
My lunch date's a no-show.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.680
Well, I'd call that a major felony, ma'am.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.140
Except judging by appearances,

18:20.224 --> 18:23.060
I'd say that your suspect
has an excellent chance of acquittal

18:23.310 --> 18:25.229
due to temporary insanity.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.359
ANDY: San Sagelo, Muskado,

18:30.442 --> 18:33.946
Saint Apoxy, Perriere, uh, Lunch Nay, uh,

18:34.321 --> 18:37.574
anything you say, FranÃ§ois,
as long as it doesn't have a screw-on cap.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.701
Don't let the backwoods charm
fool you, ma'am.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.870
He's really a very boring person.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.664
Cheryl, I'd like you to meet
my lesser half.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.833
-Bobby Hill, this is Cheryl...
-Bradford.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.584
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.254
Seems the lesser half's sister
got her car impounded.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.839
So maybe we should drive down
to South Street

18:51.922 --> 18:53.173
and check on the situation.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.134
Well, why don't you drive down
to South Street

18:55.217 --> 18:57.511
and check on the situation.
I'll just cab it back to the station

18:57.594 --> 19:00.222
after I finish my little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte
with Cheryl here.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.101
Suit yourself. Ma'am.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.357
Well, here we are.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.359
Here we are.

19:13.735 --> 19:17.114
You, uh, you sure you don't want
to have something to eat or something?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.116
No, thank you.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.204
Officer Renko, uh,

19:24.413 --> 19:27.166
do you think it would be
terribly forward of me...

19:28.333 --> 19:30.419
to tell you how attracted I am to you?

19:32.713 --> 19:35.549
Well, ma'am, uh,
it's a free country, isn't it?

19:56.236 --> 19:58.280
Just put it down, fellas,
and get your hands up real slow!

19:58.363 --> 20:00.449
-What are you guys doing here?
-Just get 'em up, huh?

20:00.532 --> 20:02.117
Don't make this any tougher
than it has to be.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.454
Make what tougher?
What the hell are you guys talking about?

20:05.537 --> 20:06.788
You're under arrest, my man.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.582
-Grand larceny.
-Hey, come on. Wait a minute.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.043
We were just taking it
down to the station for prints.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.754
It's a stereo shop heist.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.590
We couldn't carry it around in the unit
all day.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.842
We're just dropping it here
till the end of the shift.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.761
Save it, man. Will you just save it, huh?

20:21.470 --> 20:23.597
Come on, J.D. I'm 34 years old, man.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.265
You're talking about my life here!

20:26.475 --> 20:27.809
I got a family, man.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.230
I got a father who thinks
I'm some kind of neighborhood hero.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.732
This is gonna kill him. Come on, J.D.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.317
Oh, come on, J.D., please, man.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.526
No cuffs. Come on now, I'm begging--

20:36.610 --> 20:39.446
Shut up, man.
Just turn around and shut up!

20:45.202 --> 20:46.620
(Andy sighs)

20:50.374 --> 20:55.587
Oh, Cheryl, I swear you have rotated
my day 580 degrees.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.422
And I'll tell you something, lady,

20:57.506 --> 21:01.051
nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.893
-First time for everybody.
-Yeah.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.854
And what I'm dying to know is, I mean,
can I see you again?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.523
-Sure.
-When?

21:15.899 --> 21:17.609
We'll run into one another again sometime.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.610
No, no, I mean it.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.738
We had a wonderful time together.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.615
Maybe we should leave it at that.

21:24.074 --> 21:24.908
Leave it at what?

21:25.200 --> 21:27.077
Are you in the habit
of bedding down with somebody

21:27.160 --> 21:29.705
-and then never seeing them again?
-Really, I gotta go.

21:29.788 --> 21:33.250
-I've got a dentist at 3:00.
-Come on, now. Come on.

21:34.876 --> 21:35.961
Happy birthday.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.966
Wait a minute. (stammers)
How'd you know it was my birthday?

21:41.383 --> 21:45.053
-Well, you told me at the restaurant.
-No, I didn't. I definitely did not.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.472
Now wait a minute.
Now what's going on here?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.558
Now just talk to me, Cheryl.

21:50.225 --> 21:54.021
What is going on here
is that we had a terrific time.

21:54.896 --> 21:59.359
And you're an attractive, charming man
and a wonderful lover.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.821
Don't lie to me, Cheryl.
Just don't do that.

22:03.363 --> 22:06.950
Just tell me how you knew
it was my birthday.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.080
Because I was your present.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.377
I do this for a living, Andy.

22:18.086 --> 22:21.840
But that's got nothing to do with how much
I've enjoyed these last couple of hours.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.260
-Or what a sweet man I think you are.
-You are a hooker.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.346
I arrest people like you.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.309
All right, now, what do you want? Huh?

22:32.392 --> 22:34.686
Do you want $10? $20? $40?

22:35.145 --> 22:37.814
Why don't we make it an even 100
and just put ten bucks in for the charade?

22:37.898 --> 22:39.608
Or do you give
a special professional discount

22:39.691 --> 22:41.735
for cop's birthdays? Here, take this!

22:42.402 --> 22:44.279
Your friends
already took care of that, Andy.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.489
Get out.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.093
Aside from the alley shots,

23:06.176 --> 23:07.386
we've got a good five minutes of tape

23:07.469 --> 23:09.513
from the wire we planted
on the store's owner.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.431
Webster and Charles
are running serial numbers

23:11.515 --> 23:13.350
on the stuff we hauled out of the garage.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.811
Looks to be $20,000, $30,000 worth.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.648
-The store owner cooperated in this?
-Yes.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.818
I'd say we got these babies cold.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.570
I've seen those. There's nothing to say.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.989
You'll be booked here,
then moved downtown for statements.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.993
You'll be kept in special lockup overnight
and make bail, if you can, in the morning.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.205
As of now, you're suspended
from all police duties. That's all.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.716
Captain, please don't book us here.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.802
Take us down to Midtown or anywhere.

23:50.178 --> 23:51.721
Don't book us in our own station.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.807
I don't think
I could stand the sight of it, either.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.934
-Can you take them?
-Here. Midtown.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.936
Doesn't make any difference
with the department.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.397
Just leave your badges.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.119
(indistinct chatter)

24:23.670 --> 24:25.422
(chattering quiets down)

24:30.093 --> 24:33.054
Your best friend takes you to lunch,
so he says,

24:33.138 --> 24:35.557
and then sets you up
for the most humiliating experience

24:35.640 --> 24:36.933
of your entire lifetime,

24:37.017 --> 24:40.228
expecting you to get naked in the middle
of the afternoon with a total stranger!

24:40.312 --> 24:42.063
Lighten up,
it was only a birthday present.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.232
What kind of a friend
would do a thing like that?

24:44.316 --> 24:46.735
The kind who has to listen to you moaning
about your love life

24:46.818 --> 24:47.903
ten hours out of every work day.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.530
Don't you think I don't know
who else was in on this?

24:50.614 --> 24:53.033
-In on what?
-He didn't like his birthday present.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.327
-We thought it would make your day.
-It made my day, all right.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.786
-It made it downright miserable.
-What made his day?

24:56.870 --> 24:58.955
-Would you stay out of this, Lucille?
-I don't believe you, Renko.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.541
Why can't you just accept it
in the spirit that it was given?

25:01.625 --> 25:03.043
I accept it in the spirit

25:03.126 --> 25:04.002
-in which it was given!
-You mean a hooker?

25:04.085 --> 25:05.712
Will you keep your mouth down, please?

25:05.795 --> 25:07.714
A spirit of malice, moral bankruptcy

25:07.797 --> 25:11.176
-and a total lack of human consideration!
-What are you yelling at me for?

25:13.887 --> 25:15.597
Boy, I do not believe you guys.

25:22.479 --> 25:26.066
Frank.
Frank, Chief Daniels's office called.

25:26.149 --> 25:29.277
He wants to see you.
Bayside Athletic Club at 5:30.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.363
I've been waiting for this.
I'll be with Howard until then.

25:31.446 --> 25:34.199
-Did you phone Henry?
-He hasn't been in his apartment all day.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.201
-We're still trying.
-Well, try Rachel's,

25:36.284 --> 25:38.119
his folks, friends in the department.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.497
-Use your imagination, but get him here.
-All right.

25:41.164 --> 25:43.708
What's your most favorite role?

25:44.209 --> 25:45.335
Um...

25:45.418 --> 25:47.128
That question stinks, doesn't it?

25:48.588 --> 25:50.298
Listen, what I really wanna know is--

25:50.715 --> 25:53.552
Well, what's Jon Gennaro really like?

25:57.514 --> 26:01.977
Once in the papers, I saw a picture
of a guy who shot five people in a bar.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.188
I went to a mirror
and I didn't leave it...

26:06.189 --> 26:07.899
until I had that same look in my eyes.

26:09.484 --> 26:12.862
See, the thing was,
I mean, I could see the bar.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.991
I could see the bullets hitting the wall.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.451
I could hear the barmaid screaming.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.745
You see, it was all there in that look,

26:21.871 --> 26:23.039
and that's Jon Gennaro.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.083
Don't you ever scare yourself?

26:25.166 --> 26:26.543
It's just acting, Fay.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.129
Come on, motormouth.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.881
-How are you, Mrs. Furillo?
-Hi, Mick.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.885
Uh, thank you, Fay.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.737
-Who's the extra baggage?
-That's my maiden aunt.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.239
I got 10,000 here. You got the stuff?

26:56.656 --> 27:00.201
Sorry, fellas, but there ain't no stuff.
Maybe next time.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.454
What are you talking about, Woodley?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.205
Profit motive, my man.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.833
I got offered a better price
about an hour ago.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.544
We got an arrangement, hairbag.
I got orders to fill.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.755
Now let's not get pushy, cousin.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.175
Given the circumstances, I didn't even
have to show up for the meet.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.968
It's just my way of being cordial.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.845
Woodley, you're gonna blow this
over chump change.

27:18.928 --> 27:19.763
What's the matter with you?

27:19.846 --> 27:23.224
My people can move ten times this weight
on a weekly basis.

27:23.725 --> 27:27.020
Well, maybe we'll do business
some other time.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.773
-(engine starts)
-(turns off)

27:31.066 --> 27:31.900
How much?

27:32.692 --> 27:34.152
How much more are they offering?

27:35.278 --> 27:36.863
One G on top of the ten.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.167
Now there's 500 worth of good faith.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.836
And there's ten more of these on delivery.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.297
Now that's one and a half on top of ten.

27:55.256 --> 27:56.466
And I don't even know it's missing.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.306
I'll call you later
where we're gonna meet.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.559
Oh, we'll be here, my man.
But look, before you go.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.853
I tell you, you just better dig yourself.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.647
You jack us around one more time,

28:11.231 --> 28:14.651
and I'm personally gonna chop off
your right arm and have it for lunch.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.615
Man, you got some ugly relations.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.242
(engine starts)

28:23.368 --> 28:24.411
(tires screech)

28:26.830 --> 28:28.873
-What are you doing? What are you doing?
-What?

28:28.957 --> 28:31.626
-I told you to be quiet!
-I thought the deal was going south!

28:31.710 --> 28:34.170
You thought? You're not supposed to think!

28:34.254 --> 28:35.505
You're not even supposed to be here.

28:35.588 --> 28:37.132
All right, I'm sorry. Okay, I am.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.634
(sighs)

28:59.112 --> 28:59.946
Chief.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.617
What the hell
are you trying to do to me, Furillo?

29:05.201 --> 29:09.706
Less than 24 hours ago,
I ordered you to get rid of somebody.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.791
And what do I get instead of his badge?

29:11.875 --> 29:14.294
A statement from a 15-year-old prostitute.

29:14.377 --> 29:16.337
I won't get rid of an innocent man.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.547
Innocent?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.800
Alleged boffing aside, Frank,

29:21.009 --> 29:23.178
you know how many department regulations
you break

29:23.261 --> 29:26.264
when you take a runaway home with you
instead of arresting her?

29:26.347 --> 29:28.808
Is that really the issue here, Chief?
Department regulations?

29:29.142 --> 29:30.894
Need I remind you, Frank,

29:30.977 --> 29:34.564
you're the one that first raised
this whole damn holiness issue

29:34.647 --> 29:36.941
vis-Ã -vis our dear departed Lou Hogan.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.360
Now the chickens come home to Hill Street

29:39.444 --> 29:42.363
and it seems that you're not prepared
to live by it.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.033
I'm precisely prepared to live by it.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.869
I'm the only precinct captain
in the entire city

29:47.952 --> 29:51.539
who has followed up on all the charges
that Hogan sprayed at your roast.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.584
I took the badges of Coley and Lyle
less than two hours ago,

29:54.667 --> 29:57.086
and I'm prepared to take more of them
if it comes to that.

29:57.170 --> 30:00.048
And just as I expected Lou Hogan
to be responsible for his men,

30:00.131 --> 30:03.301
I take full responsibility
for Henry Goldblume right now.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.721
-Meaning what?
-Meaning I won't use him as a scapegoat.

30:07.055 --> 30:10.517
Meaning, if you take his badge and gun,
you'll find mine in the same envelope.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.186
You're replaceable, Frank.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.979
Don't imagine you're not.

30:15.355 --> 30:19.943
I've got Ron Thompson and Joe Butler
wasting away in Internal Affairs.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.780
I'm sure either would find it
most congenial up on the Hill.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.866
But if I go down on account of Goldblume,

30:26.950 --> 30:29.077
I take Arnie Detweiler with me.

30:30.870 --> 30:31.788
You what?

30:32.455 --> 30:34.457
It makes an interesting story,
don't you think?

30:34.791 --> 30:37.377
City councilman,
six times arrested for drunk driving,

30:37.460 --> 30:40.839
released yesterday at the expressed
command of the chief of police

30:40.922 --> 30:43.633
because said councilman
holds the department's purse strings.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.845
Oh, be careful, my friend.

30:47.762 --> 30:50.056
-You're treading on thin ice.
-That's the deal.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.350
Goldblume for Detweiler.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.478
I've put up with a lot of crap
from you, Furillo,

30:55.854 --> 30:58.189
that I don't tolerate
from my other captains

30:58.690 --> 31:00.733
because I respect your idealism.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.695
But you're playing politics now.

31:04.988 --> 31:08.533
And if I were you, my friend,
I'd be damn sure I knew what I was doing.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.493
If I weren't,
I wouldn't be here right now.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.497
Okay, Frank.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.334
But I want to tell you something.

31:19.669 --> 31:22.589
You're forcing me to eat something here
that I don't like.

31:24.048 --> 31:27.886
And believe me,
you're gonna pick up the tab on it.

31:33.850 --> 31:34.851
One other thing.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.146
If you ever
want to play poker with me again...

31:39.397 --> 31:42.609
you better be damn sure you have another
Arnie Detweiler in the hole.

31:44.110 --> 31:47.071
Because I promise you,
your badge ain't gonna be enough.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.046
Detailing, Frank. (chuckles)

32:03.421 --> 32:05.340
With proper detail,
a good pair of regulation

32:05.423 --> 32:07.467
US Naval Last will outlast you.

32:08.092 --> 32:10.929
You see here,
where the upper is stitched to the sole?

32:11.012 --> 32:12.764
You got to get polish in there.

32:13.139 --> 32:15.183
Leather rot sets in,
and before you can say Ho Chi Minh,

32:15.266 --> 32:16.893
you've got a malignant growth

32:16.976 --> 32:19.103
that is spreading insidiously
through the shoe.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.565
How are you feeling, Howard?

32:23.566 --> 32:28.029
Now look at this. You can't let residues
of polish accumulate around these eyelets.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.239
It'll eat through that brass

32:30.323 --> 32:33.618
as quick as a carcinogen
through a white mouse.

32:38.039 --> 32:41.292
If it comes to that, Frank... (sighs)

32:41.501 --> 32:44.462
...promise me a spartan cortege,
will you, old chum?

32:44.921 --> 32:48.132
<i>Taps </i>at sunset,
a lone volley from an M-16,

32:48.216 --> 32:51.094
and, uh, a simple limestone slab.

32:51.177 --> 32:52.804
-Howard, stop it.
-(chuckles)

32:55.431 --> 32:57.934
She could stop a Plymouth
at 90 yards, Frank.

33:00.687 --> 33:01.646
Find her a good home.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.149
Howard, please.

33:07.735 --> 33:08.569
Excuse me.

33:09.862 --> 33:13.116
Lieutenant, could I speak to you
in private, please?

33:13.408 --> 33:16.744
Uh, Frank, I may need a backup
on this call.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.250
I expect you
to be entirely frank with me, Doctor.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.710
How much time have I got?

33:24.919 --> 33:28.798
All things being equal,
I'd say 30, 40 years.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.342
Just got the biopsy report
back from the lab.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.303
The tumor was benign.
You've got a clean bill of health.

33:35.346 --> 33:38.224
I'll check in with you tomorrow
to okay your release. Captain.

33:42.603 --> 33:45.064
Howard, in case you didn't hear,

33:45.148 --> 33:46.691
you're gonna be out of here
in another day.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.359
You ought to be jumping
out of your bedsheets.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.652
Maybe so, Frank.

33:50.987 --> 33:53.531
Oh, goldarn it, Frank.

33:53.614 --> 33:55.950
When they wheeled me down here
this morning

33:56.367 --> 33:59.203
and I wasn't sure whether
this was gonna be my final battle, I--

34:00.371 --> 34:04.751
it all came to me
like a breath of brown wind.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.961
My life is an unfired shot.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.214
No wife, no children,

34:11.174 --> 34:12.717
no one to give my love to.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.304
Here I lie, 45 years old

34:16.387 --> 34:19.015
with money in the bank, education,
professional repute,

34:19.891 --> 34:22.351
yet I am bereft

34:23.102 --> 34:25.229
of all the most important things in life.

34:26.814 --> 34:30.068
Oh, I yearn to wake in the morning

34:30.151 --> 34:32.945
to the sound of little EATers
on the steps.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.947
Time for dinner, Lieutenant.

34:36.699 --> 34:40.036
-Oh, could you help take those things?
-Oh, sure.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.413
-Thank you.
-(clears throat)

34:43.498 --> 34:47.335
By the way, you know, about parenting,

34:47.877 --> 34:49.545
it's the mother's not the father's age,

34:49.629 --> 34:50.630
to be concerned about.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.549
Because many men remain virile
way up into their 80s.

34:53.633 --> 34:56.260
-Oh, really?
-And if you've been alone in your life

34:56.344 --> 34:59.263
up until now, you mustn't blame yourself.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.350
Because people just have different cycles
for when they're able

35:02.433 --> 35:04.060
to do certain things in their lives.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.687
-Uh, Nurse...
-Wulfawitz.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.064
I'm on till midnight.

35:08.147 --> 35:11.859
So if you need me, just whistle.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.033
Those are the nicest words I've heard

35:19.117 --> 35:22.245
from a partisan of the female gender
in 16 years.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.749
-Wulfawitz?
-Mm-hmm.

35:27.875 --> 35:31.337
Washington,
you got a Miss Fowler on line six.

35:31.712 --> 35:32.547
Got it, Leo.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.218
-Do you mind, J.D.?
-Huh?

35:37.301 --> 35:38.136
(phone ringing)

35:38.553 --> 35:39.887
Oh, sure.

35:47.812 --> 35:48.688
Hello, Miss Fowler.

35:51.732 --> 35:55.111
I appreciate all the time you're giving me
to think over the offer, and well, uh...

35:56.571 --> 35:57.405
I want the job.

35:59.365 --> 36:00.199
Yes.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.785
But there's one thing
we need to talk about

36:02.869 --> 36:04.203
before I can actually take it.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.083
I'd like to bring along my partner
as part of the staff.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.670
John LaRue. You talked with him.

36:16.924 --> 36:19.010
Yeah, I know he's had a few problems
in the past,

36:19.093 --> 36:20.511
but I can vouch for him now.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.602
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Fowler,
but the job really

36:27.685 --> 36:29.437
isn't that important to me without him.

36:30.771 --> 36:33.524
To be honest, we're pretty much of a team.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.612
Yes, I'm afraid it does.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.782
No, I don't think there's a chance
I'll change my mind.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.827
I'm sure you'll find a good man
for the job.

36:45.494 --> 36:47.663
Thanks for considering me. Bye.

36:52.919 --> 36:55.046
-Now why not?
-Because I won't compromise

36:55.129 --> 37:00.468
a major operation out of this precinct
just to satisfy an actor's artistic itch.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.804
We've bent over backwards for three days
to accommodate you.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.140
This is where it stops.
You're not going out.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.185
Look, I said I'll absolve the police
department of all responsibility.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.604
-I'll sign any kind of release you want.
-I've made my decision.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.946
You're right, Captain. I apologize.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.283
Thank you, Captain.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.410
Mick, ask Henry to step in here,
would you?

37:26.494 --> 37:27.328
Yes, sir.

37:36.629 --> 37:37.546
Where have you been?

37:41.759 --> 37:42.593
(clears throat)

37:45.054 --> 37:46.305
I took Josh to the movies,

37:47.682 --> 37:49.058
dropped him off at his mom's.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.643
I was driving around afterward...

37:51.519 --> 37:53.354
trying to find another movie to go to.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.065
There was a fender bender.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.483
Guys had the tire irons out.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.696
So I move in to break it up,
reach in my pocket...

38:03.197 --> 38:05.283
there's no badge, no gun.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.244
I felt naked.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.623
I don't like early retirement, Frank.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.668
-I guess I want to fight this thing.
-Nothing to fight.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.546
The girl made a statement
withdrawing all charges.

38:18.629 --> 38:19.755
What about my jacket?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.424
Didn't I violate a thousand

38:21.507 --> 38:24.010
-department regulations?
-Nothing is going into your jacket, Henry.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.095
-Why not?
-Just let it go.

38:26.178 --> 38:28.014
-I can't.
-Henry.

38:28.097 --> 38:29.974
-What'd I cost you?
-What's the difference?

38:30.391 --> 38:32.935
The difference is protecting me
instead of believing in me.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.521
How am I supposed to do that
when we both know you screwed up.

38:35.604 --> 38:38.607
No, I won't own that one, Frank.
I did what I thought was right.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.569
Henry, a lot of people
have soiled themselves

38:41.652 --> 38:44.238
cloaked in what they thought was right.

38:44.697 --> 38:48.451
I did what I thought was right
in the Hogan case. Hogan is dead.

38:48.534 --> 38:52.038
I didn't stand up for what I thought
was right with Arnie Detweiler

38:52.121 --> 38:56.042
and the result is I had something to trade
for your badge.

38:57.126 --> 39:00.004
Now explain to me what notion of right
survives all that.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.844
I don't know the answer to that, Frank.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.846
I just don't know.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.018
Maybe a civilian
can get away with playing daddy

39:14.101 --> 39:18.105
to a 15-year-old hooker
at 2:00 in the morning, but not a cop.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.692
And the fact
that you didn't have sex with her

39:21.776 --> 39:23.527
is no excuse for a lousy judgment call.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.654
-What do you want me to say, I was wrong?
-Yes.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.864
All right, I was wrong!

39:32.953 --> 39:36.123
Maybe I did make a mistake,
but I am what I am, Frank,

39:36.207 --> 39:38.751
and I can't promise you I'm not gonna make
the same kind of mistake again.

39:38.834 --> 39:42.588
And I can't promise you I'll be there
next time to cover your losses.

39:43.798 --> 39:44.965
But in the meantime, Henry...

39:46.133 --> 39:46.967
(keys jangling)

39:57.228 --> 39:58.396
take back your hardware.

40:04.693 --> 40:07.947
(door opens, closes)

40:09.198 --> 40:10.199
(sighs)

40:18.374 --> 40:19.208
Andy.

40:21.836 --> 40:24.255
Oh, Lord. What are you doing here?

40:25.339 --> 40:27.508
I went by the station
to see if I could find you.

40:27.591 --> 40:28.843
They said you might be here.

40:30.219 --> 40:33.305
I felt bad about this You're a nice guy.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.266
I thought maybe I could buy you dinner.

40:36.267 --> 40:40.813
I have had enough extravagant
celebrations today, thank you very much.

40:40.896 --> 40:43.315
Well, how about a slow walk
around the block?

40:44.650 --> 40:47.153
Look, lady, I'm a big boy.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.447
And I gotta tell you something.

40:49.697 --> 40:53.409
I don't need any sympathy
from someone such as yourself.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.244
You caught me on a bad day, that's all.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.126
You know, it could have been real good.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.254
It could have been the best thing
that ever happened to you.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.716
I'm talking about sincere human affection.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.427
I'm not incapable of that, Andy.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.639
You know,
it might come as a surprise to you,

41:16.348 --> 41:18.601
but even a whore has a personal life.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.396
I was hoping
maybe you'd want to be part of mine.

41:26.025 --> 41:26.859
Cheryl.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.574
Do you, uh, do you like baseball?

41:33.657 --> 41:35.743
-Not especially.
-Hot dogs, beers.

41:37.536 --> 41:40.873
I got these two tickets to a game tonight.

41:41.290 --> 41:42.166
I'd love to.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.919
If we're lucky,
maybe the rain will hold off.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.670
If we're luckier, maybe it won't.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.175
-(thunder crashes)
-(gasps)

41:56.138 --> 41:59.308
Lieutenant? I heard a noise.

42:04.396 --> 42:06.273
Oh. (chuckles)

42:10.778 --> 42:11.612
Isn't it silly?

42:13.781 --> 42:16.992
To have a nightmare
after getting the good news.

42:17.076 --> 42:20.829
No. Postoperative dreaming is very common.

42:21.455 --> 42:23.916
It's the anesthetic on top of the tension.

42:26.043 --> 42:29.421
Would you like to talk about it?
Sometimes it helps.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.799
Well, I was back on Hill 317.

42:33.092 --> 42:37.012
That's in Vietnam.
It was night, a flare had gone up,

42:37.805 --> 42:39.348
and I was standing in the light...

42:40.599 --> 42:42.059
fully exposed, as it were.

42:44.436 --> 42:45.563
Scared to death.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.190
You're a very special man, Lieutenant,

42:48.274 --> 42:51.777
to take on society's most thankless task.

42:52.069 --> 42:52.903
Me?

42:56.282 --> 42:57.449
-Do you think it's going to rain?
-Can I get you anything?

42:57.533 --> 42:58.951
(chuckles) Oh.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.245
Hmm.

43:03.372 --> 43:07.376
Well, I guess I'd better
get back to the desk.

43:10.588 --> 43:11.630
Nurse Wulfawitz.

43:13.632 --> 43:14.967
You touch me to the core.

43:18.137 --> 43:19.430
I'm sorry if I'm being forward,

43:19.513 --> 43:22.641
but I found it impossible
to keep from thinking about you

43:22.725 --> 43:24.560
since you first walked into this room.

43:26.020 --> 43:30.357
And each time I see you, I experience
a sensation of inner awakening

43:30.441 --> 43:32.985
that is too profound for words.

43:33.068 --> 43:35.946
Oh, Howard.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.158
I realize that sick male patients

43:39.241 --> 43:42.620
frequently develop an emotional fixation
for their nurse,

43:43.871 --> 43:44.872
but this feeling is...

43:49.376 --> 43:50.461
You called me Howard.

43:51.086 --> 43:52.463
Call me Linda, Howard.

43:53.631 --> 43:56.091
And, yes, I've heard every story there is.

43:57.259 --> 43:58.260
But a woman...

43:59.803 --> 44:02.806
a woman must never
rule out the time and place...

44:03.599 --> 44:05.017
when her man may appear.

44:07.978 --> 44:10.272
I-- I have something to confess.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.945
I was watching you sleep from the door.

44:19.031 --> 44:20.324
I feel something, too.

44:21.408 --> 44:23.535
Do you think-- (voice cracks)

44:25.120 --> 44:26.872
Do you... (clears throat)

44:26.955 --> 44:28.624
...think that a woman...

44:29.458 --> 44:30.292
(sighs)

44:31.585 --> 44:32.586
...like yourself...

44:34.421 --> 44:36.548
might like to get to know

44:37.549 --> 44:40.177
an old warrior better?

44:57.361 --> 44:59.530
-This one. Mm-hmm.
-(thunder crashes)

45:07.830 --> 45:08.872
(thunder crashes)

45:28.517 --> 45:30.561
-Say, bro.
-What do you say?

45:31.729 --> 45:33.647
Where's your mean maiden aunt?

45:35.774 --> 45:36.734
She got a headache.

45:42.114 --> 45:42.948
Let's do it.

45:46.702 --> 45:49.037
You do it, Shorty. Lie down.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.664
What the hell is this, a rip off?

45:50.748 --> 45:53.208
No, stupid,
it's the Democratic Convention.

45:54.460 --> 45:55.461
(groans)

45:59.131 --> 46:00.799
Where's your friend, that cracker?

46:01.216 --> 46:03.343
I'm by myself.

46:03.594 --> 46:04.970
Then keep us company.

46:10.434 --> 46:15.022
We're going to our car. Wouldn't want
anybody to try and stop us.

46:17.608 --> 46:19.276
(screams)

46:24.072 --> 46:25.407
-Police! Freeze!
-(gunshot)

46:27.201 --> 46:28.118
(panting)

46:28.952 --> 46:30.537
(thunder crashes)

46:32.915 --> 46:33.832
(Jon groans)

46:37.211 --> 46:38.128
(whimpers)

46:40.172 --> 46:41.799
It's funny. I can't feel nothing.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.383
You're gonna be okay.

46:44.885 --> 46:46.929
Hey, Mick. I think I'm dying.

46:47.179 --> 46:48.013
Cut that out.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.436
(groans)

46:55.020 --> 46:57.022
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:58.148 --> 47:01.860
I wanted to see the damn thing go down,
so I figured I'd trail you, you know?

47:02.569 --> 47:04.154
Just take it easy, kid.

47:05.030 --> 47:05.864
Hold me.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.161
I'm right here with you.

47:15.457 --> 47:18.961
-Some scene.
-This ain't a movie, you hairbag.

47:38.605 --> 47:39.439
Frank.

47:44.695 --> 47:47.281
Oh, my. Come here.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.284
I've been thinking.
You know what I'd like to do?

47:50.868 --> 47:51.702
Enlighten me.

47:52.369 --> 47:56.540
I'd like to secure a night's lodging
at, say, the Barton Arms,

47:57.040 --> 48:00.419
take a nice leisurely bath,
order up some room service,

48:01.253 --> 48:05.173
then slip between a set of crisp,
cool sheets and ride out the storm.

48:05.507 --> 48:06.925
Sounds like a wonderful idea.

48:07.676 --> 48:09.428
The ball's in your court, pizza man.

48:13.891 --> 48:17.269
-(phone rings)
-Let it ring, Frank, please.

48:18.103 --> 48:19.730
(continues ringing)

48:25.527 --> 48:26.361
Furillo.

48:28.363 --> 48:29.323
Yeah. Yeah?

48:42.502 --> 48:45.505
(closing theme playing)
