WEBVTT

00:03.274 --> 00:05.276
IF YOU GUYS ARE DATING,

00:05.276 --> 00:08.509
WHY DO I STILL HAVE
TO KEEP IT A SECRET?
OH, I'LL TAKE THIS ONE, BABE.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.641
OKAY.
(high-pitched voice) CUCKOO.

00:10.641 --> 00:14.014
AH. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT,
RIGHT, RIGHT.
IT'S JUST BECAUSE
THIS RELATIONSHIP IS SO NEW.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.517
I JUST... AND GRAYSON AND I
ARE LIKE POOLS.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.019
WE'RE STILL STICKING
OUR TOES IN EACH OTHER.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.021
GROSSEST THING
I HAVE EVER SAID.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.723
I'M GONNA GO THROW UP.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.225
I WANNA GET COMFORTABLE

00:24.225 --> 00:26.227
BEFORE PEOPLE START
JUDGING US, YOU KNOW?

00:26.227 --> 00:28.629
I FEEL LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE
A SHOT--

00:28.629 --> 00:31.232
ELLIE, ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
IF THE CONVERSATION
GOES ON TOO LONG

00:31.232 --> 00:33.234
WITHOUT BEING ABOUT ME,
I'M OUT!

00:33.234 --> 00:35.106
YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL TODAY.

00:35.106 --> 00:38.639
I'M BACK IN. CHECK OUT WHAT I
FOUND ON THIS MEDICAL WEB SITE.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.641
GET EVERYONE OVER HERE NOW.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.174
HERE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF THE MEDICAL STUDY.

00:43.174 --> 00:45.676
"WOMEN WHO CONSUMED
A MODERATE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL

00:45.676 --> 00:48.319
"HAD A LOWER RISK
OF BECOMING OVERWEIGHT

00:48.319 --> 00:52.183
DURING 12 YEARS
OF FOLLOW-UP." BAM.

00:52.183 --> 00:53.584
I DON'T GET IT.

00:53.584 --> 00:55.756
DRINKING KEEPS WOMEN SKINNY.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.528
OH, MY GOD!

00:57.528 --> 01:00.091
THIS IS BIGGER
THAN CURING CANCER.

01:00.091 --> 01:03.194
AND ALL TOGETHER NOW,
IF IT'S ON THE INTERNET...

01:03.194 --> 01:05.466
(all) IT MUST BE TRUE!

01:05.466 --> 01:08.169
EXACTLY. NOW, EVERYONE...
(singsongy) SIP, PLEASE.

01:10.401 --> 01:14.105
AFTERNOON, BOOZE BAGS.
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING TODAY?

01:14.105 --> 01:16.207
SCIENCE.

01:16.207 --> 01:18.449
BIG WEEK, HUH?
GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

01:18.449 --> 01:20.251
WHY ARE YOU PRETENDING
TO CARE?

01:20.251 --> 01:22.153
JUST TRYING IT OUT.
NOT A HUGE FAN.

01:22.153 --> 01:24.715
THE CEREMONY'S THIS FRIDAY,
CORRECT?
(click)

01:26.117 --> 01:28.319
WHAT? FANCY-DANCY NOTEBOOK?

01:28.319 --> 01:30.321
YEAH, IT HELPS ME
KEEP TRACK OF THINGS

01:30.321 --> 01:32.323
LIKE APPOINTMENTS,
BIRTHDAYS, PHONE NUMBERS,

01:32.323 --> 01:35.266
PEOPLE I OWE MONEY TO/
NEED TO AVOID.

01:35.266 --> 01:36.827
AH.
MAKES SENSE.

01:36.827 --> 01:39.670
(Grayson) OF COURSE.
PLUS IT MAKES ME
LOOK SMART. OBSERVE.

01:39.670 --> 01:42.203
WOW. YOU LOOK LIKE
A ROCKET SCIENTIST.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.474
WHAT'D YOU WRITE?

01:43.474 --> 01:45.206
"I LOVE PRETZELS."

01:45.206 --> 01:46.837
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

01:46.837 --> 01:50.881
YOU WROTE "I," THEN A HEART,
THEN A SQUIGGLY LINE.
THAT'S A PRETZEL.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.244
GOOD GOD.
TO GETTIN' SKINNY!

01:53.244 --> 01:54.745
(Andy) GETTIN' SKINNY

01:54.745 --> 01:56.887
(all) WHOO!

01:58.749 --> 02:00.191
THANK YOU.

02:00.191 --> 02:02.323
OKAY, I'VE GOT
THE GRADUATION TICKETS.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.425
YAY! COOL.
YOU GUYS, CHECK THIS OUT.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.429
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WENT HERE.
I DIDN'T.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.862
I JUST WROTE THAT WHILE YOU GUYS
WERE GETTING THE TICKETS.

02:11.862 --> 02:14.505
(lowered voice) WELL,
PUT MY NAME. I ROCK, TOO.
OKAY.

02:14.505 --> 02:16.667
JULES, LOOK!

02:16.667 --> 02:18.269
REMEMBER THAT
CAR DEALERSHIP PROMOTION

02:18.269 --> 02:21.172
WHERE THEY LET THAT RED BALLOON
GO WITH 2,000 BUCKS IN IT?

02:21.172 --> 02:22.573
I BET THAT'S IT.

02:22.573 --> 02:26.677
I'M GONNA GO CLIMB THAT POLE,
LOGGER-STYLE.

02:26.677 --> 02:29.220
SORRY I CAN'T MAKE IT
TO TRAV'S GRADUATION.

02:29.220 --> 02:31.522
SMITH HAS TO GO TO THE BAHAMAS
ON A WORK THING,

02:31.522 --> 02:33.184
AND HE INVITED ME
TO TAG ALONG,

02:33.184 --> 02:35.526
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE
GOING TO COUNTRIES

02:35.526 --> 02:38.158
WITH HANDSOME BLACK MEN
WANDERING AROUND.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE
OF YOUR FAVORITE THINGS.

02:38.158 --> 02:42.393
AND TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT
WITH SMITH...
IT'S SO ROMANTIC.
OH, HONEY, IT'S OKAY.

02:42.393 --> 02:45.636
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING
UP THERE?
GETTIN' THERE!

02:49.540 --> 02:52.203
(loud pop)
WRONG BALLOON. LET'S GO.

02:53.444 --> 02:55.946
WHY DO YOU HAVE A DART
IN YOUR PURSE?

02:57.248 --> 02:59.250
WHO KEEPS TAKING
MY DARTS?

02:59.250 --> 03:01.252
MAYBE SOMEONE THINKS
IT'S DANGEROUS

03:01.252 --> 03:03.754
TO HAVE DARTS FLYING AROUND
WHILE PEOPLE ARE DRINKING.

03:03.754 --> 03:06.257
I DON'T KNOW. (mumbles)

03:06.257 --> 03:08.419
THIS--THIS IS A BUSINESS,
YOU KNOW.

03:08.419 --> 03:10.190
(laughs) GOOD ONE.

03:11.722 --> 03:12.963
AH.

03:12.963 --> 03:16.227
SO, TRAV, YOU GIVING
THE SPEECH AT GRADUATION?

03:16.227 --> 03:18.399
NOPE.
NOT THE VALEDICTORIAN.

03:18.399 --> 03:22.202
ISN'T THERE ALSO ANOTHER SPEAKER
THAT'S NOT A GIANT NERD?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.204
YEAH. THEY PICK
AN AVERAGE STUDENT

03:24.204 --> 03:26.206
TO KIND OF SPEAK
FOR THE MASSES.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.779
IT'S CALLED "THE EVERYMAN,"
BUT I DIDN'T SUBMIT A SPEECH.

03:28.779 --> 03:31.282
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST DON'T THINK
GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL'S

03:31.282 --> 03:33.584
REALLY THAT BIG A DEAL.
WHAT? IT'S HUGE!

03:33.584 --> 03:35.986
I'M WITH HER, BUDDY.
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

03:35.986 --> 03:38.449
THAT I PEAKED IN HIGH SCHOOL.
WEIRD THING TO POUND OUT.

03:38.449 --> 03:40.451
I WAS A STUD IN HIGH SCHOOL,
TOO.

03:40.451 --> 03:42.453
I USED TO BUY BEER
FOR EVERYBODY.

03:42.453 --> 03:44.795
BALD BY 16.

03:44.795 --> 03:47.658
WELL, DIDN'T AGE PREMATURELY,
SO...

03:47.658 --> 03:51.962
FOR ME, IT'S JUST OVER.
DO ME A FAVOR. AT GRADUATION,

03:51.962 --> 03:54.805
LET'S NOT MAKE A CRAZY,
GIANT DEAL ABOUT IT, OKAY?

03:54.805 --> 03:57.007
WHATEVER YOU WANT, SWEETIE.

03:57.007 --> 03:58.339
THANKS.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.371
THAT KID DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WANTS.

04:00.371 --> 04:02.343
MNH-MNH.
MNH-MNH.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.315
THAT'S... MY BEER.

04:07.918 --> 04:10.421
YOU SUCK AT MUSICAL BEERS.

04:10.421 --> 04:12.683
THIS IS MY BAR, DAMN IT!

04:12.683 --> 04:15.686
OKAY. YOU GUYS HAVE ONE JOB,
AND THAT'S TO COME UP

04:15.686 --> 04:17.688
WITH SOMETHING GREAT
FOR TRAVIS' GRADUATION

04:17.688 --> 04:19.860
THAT JUST SHOWS HIM
HOW PROUD WE ALL ARE.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.962
JUST GOTTA BE BIG!

04:21.962 --> 04:24.295
AND I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT SOME LITTLE BUTTON

04:24.295 --> 04:27.438
WITH HIS BABY PICTURE ON IT,
OKAY? 'CAUSE THAT IS WEAK SAUCE.

04:27.438 --> 04:31.542
I ALREADY WROTE DOWN
A FANTASTIC IDEA. HOLD ON.

04:31.542 --> 04:34.545
HOLD ON.
OOH, I DO LOVE PRETZELS.

04:34.545 --> 04:38.008
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA BURN
THAT NOTEBOOK.
FOUND IT!

04:38.008 --> 04:40.451
BABY PICTURE BUTTONS.

04:40.451 --> 04:42.012
SHOOT.

04:42.012 --> 04:45.916
JULES, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE 90 DEGREES ON FRIDAY.

04:45.916 --> 04:48.419
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME GO
TO TRAVIS' GRADUATION.

04:48.419 --> 04:50.521
I'LL HATE IT.

04:50.521 --> 04:52.693
LOOK, MY FAMILY NEVER
SHOWED UP FOR BIG EVENTS.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.565
WITH TRAVIS...

04:54.565 --> 04:56.627
YOU HAVE PERFECT SKIN.
I'M BACK IN.

04:56.627 --> 04:58.369
ELLIE TORRES,
YOU ARE MY FAMILY.

04:58.369 --> 05:00.901
IF YOU TRY TO SKIP OUT
ON TRAVIS' GRADUATION,

05:00.901 --> 05:02.903
I WILL MURDER YOU... HARD.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.405
FINE. I'LL GO.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.408
BUT GUESS WHO'S COMING
WITH ME.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.079
BAM!

05:09.079 --> 05:13.083
HOLY BIG HAT! LOVE IT.
HIDES SO MUCH OF YOUR FACE.

05:13.083 --> 05:14.445
(crunches loudly)

05:14.445 --> 05:16.587
DID ANDY LET YOU IN?
UH-HUH.

05:16.587 --> 05:18.589
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT
WITHOUT WARNING ME.

05:18.589 --> 05:21.822
(chuckling)

05:21.822 --> 05:23.924
AAH!
AAH!

05:23.924 --> 05:26.757
THAT'S FOR
LETTING LAURIE IN.

05:26.757 --> 05:28.359
ALL RIGHT, COME HERE.
LOVE YOU.

05:28.359 --> 05:29.630
MMM!

05:29.630 --> 05:30.931
BYE.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.434
MMM, I LOVE IT.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN PRISON.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.440
OH, YOU GOT YOUR YEARBOOK.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.942
BESIDES MY SENIOR PHOTO,
THERE'S ONE PICTURE OF ME,

05:41.942 --> 05:44.945
AND IT'S WITH MR. GOULSBY,
THE CREEPY WOOD SHOP TEACHER.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.348
(chuckles) WHY DO YOU HAVE
YOUR HANDS ON HIS BREASTS?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.981
BECAUSE I WAS PRETENDING
TO PUSH HIM INTO THE BAND SAW,

05:50.981 --> 05:53.924
BUT THEY CROPPED THAT PART OUT.
BUMMER FOR YOU, DUDE.
WHAT HAPPENED

05:53.924 --> 05:56.427
TO MR. I DON'T CARE
ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL?

05:56.427 --> 06:00.030
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?
I DIDN'T MAKE ANY MARK AT ALL.

06:00.030 --> 06:03.093
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IS THAT YOU GOT THROUGH IT.

06:03.093 --> 06:05.966
IT'S NOT LIKE I MADE
SOME BIG SPLASH IN HIGH SCHOOL.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.969
REALLY? BECAUSE I GOT
YOUR YEARBOOK.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.971
WE DON'T NEED
TO LOOK THROUGH THAT.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.073
I MEAN, I'M BARELY IN IT.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.407
LOOK. INSIDE COVER--
YOU AS THE PROM QUEEN.

06:16.407 --> 06:19.049
YEAH, I GOT 98% OF THE VOTE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

06:19.049 --> 06:21.051
I MEAN,
IT'S ONLY ONE THING.

06:21.051 --> 06:22.853
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I WAS SUPER COOL.

06:22.853 --> 06:25.686
IS THIS YOU DANCING ONSTAGE
WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN?

06:25.686 --> 06:28.659
YEAH. THAT WAS SUPER COOL.
(chuckles)

06:30.961 --> 06:32.993
STOP.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.595
I'M SORRY.

06:34.595 --> 06:40.601
в™Єв™Є

06:46.076 --> 06:47.578
...39, 40.

06:47.578 --> 06:50.080
THERE ARE 40 PICTURES
OF YOU IN THIS YEARBOOK.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.082
HOW IS THIS HELPING?
OOH, 42 IF YOU COUNT

06:52.082 --> 06:55.085
THESE KIDS WHO DRESSED UP AS YOU
FOR THE HALLOWEEN DANCE.

06:55.085 --> 06:58.519
OH, YEAH, THE BEASLEY TWINS.
MM, WEIRD BOYS.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.551
WHY DIDN'T I PLAY ANY SPORTS?

07:00.551 --> 07:02.693
DIDN'T I LIKE FOOTBALL
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER?

07:02.693 --> 07:04.695
WHY'D I STOP PLAYING THAT?

07:04.695 --> 07:07.097
MRS. COBB,
HE JUST SKINNED HIS KNEE!

07:07.097 --> 07:10.130
NEVER AGAIN! NEVER AGAIN!

07:10.130 --> 07:12.833
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU JUST DECIDED YOU HATED IT.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.005
HMM.
OKAY, SAD FACE...

07:15.005 --> 07:16.937
DON'T YOU MEAN "NORMAL FACE"?
REALLY?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.008
SORRY.

07:18.008 --> 07:19.940
YOU'RE GONNA WRITE A SPEECH,

07:19.940 --> 07:22.012
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
"THE EVERYMAN" GUY.
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA PICK ME.

07:22.012 --> 07:24.014
IF YOU BELIEVED IN YOURSELF

07:24.014 --> 07:26.717
EVEN HALF AS MUCH
AS I BELIEVE IN YOU,

07:26.717 --> 07:29.480
YOU WOULD KNOW
YOU COULD DO ANYTHING.
YOU...

07:29.480 --> 07:31.522
YES, I GOT THAT
FROM A SANDRA BULLOCK MOVIE,

07:31.522 --> 07:33.524
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I STILL MEAN IT.

07:33.524 --> 07:35.025
ALL RIGHT. WHY NOT?

07:35.025 --> 07:36.727
(chair scrapes floor)

07:36.727 --> 07:39.089
DID THEY DO A PLAY
ABOUT YOU?

07:39.089 --> 07:41.962
(chuckles) NO! STOP IT!

07:41.962 --> 07:43.494
(sighs)

07:43.494 --> 07:46.466
(under breath) IT WAS A MUSICAL,
AND IT WAS BRILLIANT.

07:48.839 --> 07:54.104
OH, THANK YOU. MMM.
(mouth full) HIT IT.

07:54.104 --> 07:58.008
SO... MY TRIP WITH SMITH
FELL THROUGH.

07:58.008 --> 08:01.582
OH, BUT I DIDN'T BUY YOU
A TICKET TO TRAVIS' GRADUATION.

08:01.582 --> 08:04.084
I MEAN, IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
I'LL JUST MISS IT,

08:04.084 --> 08:06.987
AND THEN MAYBE I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS AFTER.
(cell phone rings)

08:06.987 --> 08:08.158
OKAY. HELLO?

08:08.158 --> 08:10.721
I NEED TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

08:10.721 --> 08:12.763
THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE.
(gasps)

08:12.763 --> 08:16.026
THAT'S BOOTY CALL LANGUAGE.
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
I'M TALKING TO THE CEMETERY.

08:16.026 --> 08:18.028
THEY WANT TO MOVE
MY DAD'S CASKET.

08:18.028 --> 08:20.871
WORST LIAR EVER.

08:20.871 --> 08:25.035
BY A CREEK WOULD BE GREAT.
MY DAD LOVED CREEKS.
OH.

08:25.035 --> 08:29.109
в™Є WE CAN'T HIDE OUR HEARTS,
WE WON'T PLAY THE FOOLS в™Є

08:29.109 --> 08:34.885
в™Є OUR LOVE IS YOURS ALWAYS,
JULES в™Є

08:34.885 --> 08:36.647
SO?
AWFUL.

08:36.647 --> 08:40.621
NOW IT'S MY TURN TO SHARE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.623
OKAY, YOU GUYS MOCK
ALL YOU WANT,

08:42.623 --> 08:45.125
BUT THAT SONG
WILL BE IN YOUR HEAD LATER.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.027
IF IT IS, IT'LL BE MY LAST
THOUGHT BEFORE I SHOOT MYSELF.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.700
SO THEY PICKED
"MR. EVERYMAN."

08:49.700 --> 08:53.203
YOU'RE DOING THAT FAKE MISLEAD,
AREN'T YOU? IT'S YOU!

08:53.203 --> 08:55.706
IT'S NOT.
YES, IT'S YOU!

08:55.706 --> 08:56.767
MOM, STOP.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.008
I'M SORRY.

08:58.008 --> 09:00.871
OKAY, IT'S ME!
AAH! OH, GOD!

09:00.871 --> 09:02.873
COME HERE!
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!
OH!

09:02.873 --> 09:06.647
WAY TO GO, TRAV.
LET'S GO TO THE MALL WHERE
THEY PRINT YOUR PICTURE

09:06.647 --> 09:09.119
ON A SWEATSHIRT, BECAUSE
I DON'T WANNA JUST REMEMBER

09:09.119 --> 09:10.781
THIS MOMENT, TRAVIS.
I WANNA WEAR IT.

09:10.781 --> 09:13.784
THAT'S KINDA WEIRD, BUT I'M
TOO PSYCHED TO BE HUMILIATED,

09:13.784 --> 09:16.086
SO LET'S GO.
(laughs)

09:20.631 --> 09:22.993
JULES?
NO.

09:22.993 --> 09:24.665
AH...

09:24.665 --> 09:26.136
UH, NO.

09:27.137 --> 09:28.599
HELLO.

09:28.599 --> 09:30.170
WH-WHERE'S JULES?

09:30.170 --> 09:33.644
CRAZY TOWN. NICE DRESS.
IF YOU'RE GOING FOR CLASSY,

09:33.644 --> 09:36.176
THAT SHIP SAILED
ABOUT THREE TATTOOS AGO.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.679
I ONLY HAVE TWO.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.652
THAT WAS EASY.

09:41.652 --> 09:44.815
THE KEY IS TO COME UP WITH
SOMETHING TO SHOW TRAVIS

09:44.815 --> 09:47.317
HOW PROUD WE ARE,
SO I'M THINKING FIREWORKS.

09:47.317 --> 09:49.820
WHEN HE GOES UP
TO GET HIS DIPLOMA,

09:49.820 --> 09:51.361
I LIGHT A FIRECRACKER
LIKE SO.
(click)

09:51.361 --> 09:53.063
BE CAREFUL, BOBBY.

09:53.063 --> 09:55.696
WHAT? IT'S JUST
A TINY, LITTLE FIRE--
(loud pop)

09:55.696 --> 09:56.967
(groans loudly)

09:56.967 --> 10:01.101
NEVER AGAIN! NEVER AGAIN!

10:01.101 --> 10:02.803
(loudly)
WHAT? I'M FINE, BUDDY.

10:02.803 --> 10:06.176
JUST QUIT TALKING
SO QUIET.

10:06.176 --> 10:08.278
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NO ONE'S ALLOWED TO TOUCH

10:08.278 --> 10:10.741
ELLIE'S NEW BIG HAT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:10.741 --> 10:14.645
(gasps) PUT THE SCISSORS DOWN
AND STEP AWAY FROM THE HAT.

10:14.645 --> 10:18.318
I... AM SO SICK
OF YOU PICKING ON ME!

10:18.318 --> 10:20.320
"LAURIE'S STUPID.
LAURIE'S A TRAMP.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.053
LAURIE FIXED HER BROKEN TOOTH
WITH KRAZY GLUE."

10:23.053 --> 10:26.056
OH, AND THOSE EYE ROLLS--
LIKE YOU THINK YOU ARE

10:26.056 --> 10:29.700
SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME!
AM I SUPPOSED TO JUST SIT HERE

10:29.700 --> 10:31.301
AND TAKE IT?
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

10:31.301 --> 10:34.164
I AM DONE WITH THAT.

10:34.164 --> 10:36.867
SO THIS... IS HAPPENING.
(Andy) NO, NO.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.209
OH, OH, YEAH.

10:39.209 --> 10:42.673
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN.
(mouths words)

10:42.673 --> 10:44.214
AND AGAIN. STILL HAPPENING!

10:46.216 --> 10:48.118
(sighs)

10:49.720 --> 10:51.982
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
THAT HAT WAS SO BIG,

10:51.982 --> 10:53.984
YOU CAN PROBABLY MAKE
A THOUSAND TINY ONES.

10:53.984 --> 10:55.225
(door slams)

10:55.225 --> 10:59.089
I DON'T CARE THAT
YOU'RE COVERING YOUR FACE.

10:59.089 --> 11:00.390
I KNOW IT'S YOU.

11:00.390 --> 11:04.064
THANK YOU
FOR BELIEVING IN ME...

11:04.064 --> 11:06.797
AND I LOVE YOU.

11:06.797 --> 11:08.899
(giggles and sniffles)

11:08.899 --> 11:13.804
AND THAT WEIRD SOUND
IS MY CUE TO GO, SO...

11:13.804 --> 11:15.245
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

11:17.347 --> 11:20.080
(lowered voice) WHOA!
THAT WAS INSANE!

11:20.080 --> 11:22.813
HE WAS LITERALLY SITTING
ON MY FACE.

11:22.813 --> 11:25.155
HE'S NEVER HAD MUCH FEELING
IN HIS BUTT.

11:25.155 --> 11:28.058
WHEN HE WAS A KID, I USED TO
PICK HIM UP BY HIS LITTLE TUSH

11:28.058 --> 11:30.761
AND CARRY HIM AROUND
WITHOUT HIM EVEN WAKING UP.

11:30.761 --> 11:33.263
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT THAT.

11:33.263 --> 11:36.126
OKAY, LISTEN, I STOLE
HIS SPEECH OFF HIS DESK.

11:36.126 --> 11:40.000
OR INSTEAD OF READING THAT,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.834
YOU COULD, UM, TAKE OFF
THAT RIDICULOUS SWEATSHIRT.

11:43.834 --> 11:44.905
AWESOME SWEATSHIRT.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.306
AWESOME SWEATSHIRT, I MEAN,

11:46.306 --> 11:48.308
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
WELL, I COULD, UH,

11:48.308 --> 11:50.981
I COULD KISS YOUR NECK.

11:50.981 --> 11:54.114
MMM.

11:54.114 --> 11:58.188
AND THEN... I COULD...
(whispers indistinctly)

11:58.188 --> 12:00.290
YEAH, YEAH,
I KNOW HOW SEX WORKS.

12:00.290 --> 12:02.893
(gasps)
OOH, HERE'S THE GOLD.

12:02.893 --> 12:07.197
"THERE IS NO WAY
I WOULD BE WHERE I AM,

12:07.197 --> 12:09.459
"OR FOR THAT MATTER,
WHO I AM,

12:09.459 --> 12:14.064
"IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE LOVE
AND SUPPORT OF...

12:14.064 --> 12:15.806
BOBBY COBB"?

12:15.806 --> 12:17.868
(chuckles)

12:17.868 --> 12:21.171
I'M NOT EVEN IN HERE!
I KNOW WHAT CAN MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

12:24.214 --> 12:25.245
(thud)
(groans)

12:25.245 --> 12:26.947
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY?

12:26.947 --> 12:29.119
MY FAULT FOR TRYING.

12:36.887 --> 12:40.060
"SOME JUST SEE A CRAZY MAN
CHASING A RED BALLOON,

12:40.060 --> 12:43.163
BUT I SEE A DAD TEACHING ME
TO NEVER GIVE UP."

12:43.163 --> 12:45.135
CAN YOU BELIEVE
HE WROTE THAT CRAP?

12:45.135 --> 12:48.198
I CAN BECAUSE IT'S THE HUNDREDTH
TIME YOU'VE READ IT TO ME.

12:48.198 --> 12:50.901
GUESS WHO JUST
SIGNED HIMSELF UP FOR A DAY

12:50.901 --> 12:53.773
OF BEING REMINDED
OF HOW MUCH I DO FOR HIM.
PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE ME.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.247
I RAISED THAT KID,
AND THIS IS THE THANKS I GET?

12:57.247 --> 12:59.249
(muffled) UHH! I CAN'T...

12:59.249 --> 13:02.252
(gasping) THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

13:02.252 --> 13:03.783
YOU'RE ALIVE.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.786
NOW QUIT YOUR BITCHING
AND GO GET ME SOME COFFEE.
WHAT?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.259
WELCOME TO THE SECOND WEEK
OF DATING. FUN!

13:09.259 --> 13:11.061
LET'S GO.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.162
GO, GO!

13:12.162 --> 13:13.463
LET'S GO! GO, GO!

13:13.463 --> 13:16.496
IS ANYONE HAVING
A WORSE MORNING THAN THIS?

13:18.528 --> 13:20.570
WAKEY-WAKEY!
AAH!

13:20.570 --> 13:24.304
I BROKE A WINDOW TO GET IN.
THIS IS YOUR NEW DRESS, RIGHT?

13:24.304 --> 13:27.307
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I DON'T CARE.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.079
WELL, COME BACK OUT.

13:29.079 --> 13:30.140
NO!

13:30.140 --> 13:31.912
YOU'RE RUINING IT.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.017
SO WHAT'S THAT
ALL ABOUT?

13:37.017 --> 13:40.020
AH, WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH
HOW TO PROPERLY LET YOU KNOW

13:40.020 --> 13:42.552
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU
AT YOUR GRADUATION,

13:42.552 --> 13:46.026
AND THIS SEEMED LIKE
THE MOST SENSIBLE OPTION.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.297
I THINK IT'S CHARMING.

13:47.297 --> 13:49.860
IT'S AN INFLATABLE GORILLA!

13:49.860 --> 13:52.432
IT WAS ANDY'S IDEA TO PUT
YOUR FACE ON IT.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.335
COOL, COOL. CAN WE TALK INSIDE
FOR A SEC?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.137
HUH?

13:57.137 --> 13:59.439
NO.
COME ON!

13:59.439 --> 14:02.272
IF I TOLD YOU THAT GORILLA'S
THE VERY SAME ONE

14:02.272 --> 14:05.015
FROM THE CAR DEALERSHIP
THAT LET THAT MONEY BALLOON GO,

14:05.015 --> 14:07.017
AND I FEEL LIKE
THIS MIGHT BRING US

14:07.017 --> 14:09.849
SOME KIND OF KARMIC GOOD WILL
IN OUR QUEST TO FIND

14:09.849 --> 14:12.152
THAT VERY BALLOON--WOULD THAT
MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO YOU?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.483
MM, NO.

14:13.483 --> 14:15.986
EXCUSE ME. DO YOU WANNA
WEIGH IN HERE?

14:15.986 --> 14:18.989
OH, I'M SORRY. I WAS JUST
WORKING ON A PAYMENT PLAN

14:18.989 --> 14:20.360
FOR YOUR COLLEGE TUITION.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.163
IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED, 'CAUSE
I ALSO HAVE TO SET ASIDE

14:23.163 --> 14:26.166
SOME OF MY MONEY
FOR YOUR FOOD AND YOUR CLOTHES.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.468
OTHERWISE YOU'D DIE OF HUNGER,
OR AT LEAST GET SICK

14:28.468 --> 14:31.871
FROM, YOU KNOW, BEING NAKED
ALL THE TIME.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.873
LOOK, MY GRADUATION IS TOMORROW.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.176
CAN WE NOT JUST GO ONE DAY
WITHOUT EMBARRASSING ME?

14:36.176 --> 14:37.577
ONE DAY.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.650
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.
I'LL HANDLE THIS THE WAY

14:40.650 --> 14:44.214
I'VE GOTTEN YOU OVER MOST OF
YOUR LIFE'S MAJOR HURDLES.

14:44.214 --> 14:47.287
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
NO DIFFERENT THAN, UH, WHEN

14:47.287 --> 14:50.320
I TAUGHT YOU HOW TO READ.
THIS FEELS
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.164
(gasps) LOOK OVER THERE, ANDY.
IT'S YOUR HOUSE. GO TO IT.
I'M GOOD.

14:57.928 --> 14:59.269
HELLO.

14:59.269 --> 15:01.271
HAVE YOU BEEN SITTING THERE
FOR 20 MINUTES?

15:01.271 --> 15:03.403
WHAT ELSE HAVE I GOT TO DO?
I'M ELLIE!

15:03.403 --> 15:05.405
WHY THE FREAK-OUT,
LITTLE BEAR?

15:05.405 --> 15:08.078
WE ALWAYS GIVE EACH OTHER CRAP,
AND YOU DON'T CARE.

15:08.078 --> 15:09.379
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

15:09.379 --> 15:13.113
I ONLY GOT THIS STUPID DRESS
FOR TRAVIS' GRADUATION.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.115
IT'S WHY I'M SKIPPING
MY BAHAMAS TRIP.

15:15.115 --> 15:18.148
I WANTED TO BE HERE BECAUSE--
YOUR HAIR LOOKS REALLY NICE.

15:18.148 --> 15:19.419
BACK IN.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.421
WHEN YOU TRIED TO BACK OUT

15:21.421 --> 15:24.154
OF GOING TO TRAVIS' GRADUATION,
JULES THREATENED TO MURDER YOU.

15:24.154 --> 15:26.326
WHEN I SAID
I WAS SKIPPING IT,

15:26.326 --> 15:28.558
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TRY
TO CONVINCE ME NOT TO.

15:28.558 --> 15:30.560
SHE DIDN'T CARE!

15:30.560 --> 15:33.463
IT'S NOT NICE TO TEST FRIENDS
WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW

15:33.463 --> 15:36.166
THEY'RE BEING TESTED.
LOOK, FOR A LONG TIME,

15:36.166 --> 15:38.268
MY SELF-ESTEEM WAS TIED
TO WHETHER OR NOT

15:38.268 --> 15:41.671
A MAN WANTED ME SEXUALLY.
YOUR MOM DID SUCH A GREAT JOB
WITH YOU.

15:41.671 --> 15:44.644
I KNOW. BUT THEN I BECAME
FRIENDS WITH JULES,

15:44.644 --> 15:46.616
AND SOMEONE LIKE HER
LIKING ME

15:46.616 --> 15:48.979
MADE ME FEEL LIKE
I WAS WORTH SOMETHING,

15:48.979 --> 15:51.281
AND I GET THAT YOU GUYS HAVE
ALL THIS HISTORY,

15:51.281 --> 15:53.323
BUT SOMETIMES
IT'S REALLY HARD

15:53.323 --> 15:56.456
FEELING LIKE SHE CARES MORE
ABOUT YOU.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.990
CLICK. YOU AND I DON'T
TALK ON THE PHONE,

15:59.990 --> 16:02.632
BUT THIS IS HOW I'M GONNA
HANG UP ON YOU FROM NOW ON

16:02.632 --> 16:04.734
WHEN YOU SAY STUPID THINGS.

16:04.734 --> 16:07.737
YOU KNOW JULES LOVES YOU,
AND, YES, I'D LIKE TO THINK

16:07.737 --> 16:10.740
IF THERE WAS A FIRE, AND JULES
COULD ONLY SAVE ONE OF US,

16:10.740 --> 16:13.673
I'D HAVE TO GET A SHRINK
TO GET YOUR DEATH SCREAMS

16:13.673 --> 16:16.106
OUT OF MY HEAD,

16:16.106 --> 16:18.248
BUT HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE'D PICK.

16:18.248 --> 16:20.680
THANK YOU, ELLIE.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.183
DON'T TRY TO ACT LIKE
THIS IS A NICE MOMENT.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.355
THAT'S EVEN CRAZIER THAN
HAVING 12 PICTURES

16:25.355 --> 16:27.387
OF TAYE DIGGS
ON YOUR APARTMENT.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.560
I ONLY PUT THEM OUT
WHEN SMITH ISN'T HERE.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.222
OHH.

16:32.222 --> 16:34.364
HIS SMILE LIGHTS UP
THE WORLD.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.697
(speaking inaudibly)

16:37.697 --> 16:40.670
LOOK AT HIM OVER THERE
HAVING LUNCH WITH HIS DAD.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.332
MAKES ME WANNA PUKE.

16:42.332 --> 16:44.634
WHEN I AM BEING
THIS PETTY,

16:44.634 --> 16:47.577
DOES IT MAKE ME SEEM MORE
OR LESS SEXY?

16:47.577 --> 16:50.240
IT MAKES YOU SEEM LIKE
AN ASEXUAL MAN GOBLIN.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.282
OH.

16:52.282 --> 16:54.284
YOU KNOW
WHAT THE WORST PART IS?

16:54.284 --> 16:57.517
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A CHORE, I STILL LIKE YOU.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.350
OH, THAT MUST BE FRUSTRATING.
IT REALLY IS.

17:00.350 --> 17:02.252
I'M JUST GONNA TALK
TO TRAVIS

17:02.252 --> 17:04.554
AND JUST TELL HIM WHY
I'M SO UPSET.
DO NOT DO THAT.

17:04.554 --> 17:07.297
IF WE'RE GONNA DATE,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO AT LEAST

17:07.297 --> 17:10.100
PRETEND TO LISTEN TO ME
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

17:10.100 --> 17:14.204
I CAN DO THAT.
I'LL JUST NOD A LOT. BRING IT.
YOU KNOW TRAVIS LOVES YOU.

17:14.204 --> 17:16.366
MM-HMM.
AND IF YOU GUILT HIM

17:16.366 --> 17:18.638
ABOUT WRITING A NICE SPEECH
ABOUT BOBBY,

17:18.638 --> 17:21.441
HE'LL FEEL HORRIBLE,
AND THEN YOU'LL FEEL HORRIBLE.
MM.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.043
AND THEN YOU'LL TURN BACK
INTO A MAN GOBLIN, AND--

17:24.043 --> 17:26.146
WOULD YOU STOP NODDING?
JUST LET THIS GO,

17:26.146 --> 17:28.418
AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
IN THE END, OKAY?

17:28.418 --> 17:30.120
TRUST ME, FOR ONCE.

17:33.583 --> 17:36.826
THERE'S A GIANT GORILLA
WITH TRAVIS' FACE OUTSIDE.
WE KNOW.

17:36.826 --> 17:38.628
HE'S BLUE.

17:38.628 --> 17:42.262
OKAY. LOOK, SINCE YOU DIDN'T
SHRED MY DRESS, I GOT YOU THIS.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.295
WHAT? DID I MISS A FIGHT?
NOTHING BIG.

17:45.295 --> 17:47.297
JUST HAT MURDER.
OKAY, LISTEN,

17:47.297 --> 17:49.339
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TOWN
THIS WEEKEND,

17:49.339 --> 17:51.341
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
GOING TO TRAVIS' GRADUATION.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.843
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
(mouthing words)

17:53.843 --> 17:56.646
LAURIE, YOU'RE FAMILY.
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE.

17:56.646 --> 17:59.779
OKAY. SURE, I'LL COME.
YEAH.

17:59.779 --> 18:03.383
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I... I'LL JUST
SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW, THEN.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.755
DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YA.

18:05.755 --> 18:09.088
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
THANKS FOR TELLING ME.
(door opens and closes)

18:09.088 --> 18:12.292
IF YOU EVER LET HER KNOW,
OUR FRIENDSHIP IS OVER.
OKAY.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.264
(Nuno Bettencourt)
в™Є SO YOU GOT TO GO в™Є

18:14.264 --> 18:18.528
в™Є BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE в™Є
IT ISN'T BIG ENOUGH.

18:18.528 --> 18:20.270
REALLY?

18:20.270 --> 18:25.505
в™Є WHAT'S LEFT TO DO,
WISH YOU THE BEST в™Є

18:25.505 --> 18:26.676
HELLO, JULES.

18:26.676 --> 18:29.639
BARB? DO YOU HAVE
A RELATIVE GRADUATING?

18:29.639 --> 18:32.242
(laughs) NO, SILLY.
OH, HERE IT GOES.

18:32.242 --> 18:35.245
I'M HERE WITH SOME FRIENDS
FOR OUR ANNUAL FANTASY DRAFT.

18:35.245 --> 18:37.717
IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO SEE
THE TALENT UP CLOSE

18:37.717 --> 18:39.749
BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR PICKS.
HEY, MOM.

18:39.749 --> 18:42.392
OH, TRAVIS COBB.
LET'S SEE. YES.

18:42.392 --> 18:44.354
TRAVIS GETS SCOOPED UP
IN THE EARLY ROUNDS.

18:44.354 --> 18:45.695
(whispers) CONGRATS.

18:45.695 --> 18:48.127
PLEASE GO SIT
VERY FAR AWAY.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.400
в™Є HAPPY в™Є

18:50.400 --> 18:51.731
I FEEL VIOLATED.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.763
LOOK AT YOU IN YOUR OUTFIT.

18:53.763 --> 18:55.335
I KNOW. I'M ADORABLE.
(chuckles)

18:55.335 --> 18:58.338
OH. BY THE WAY, MY SPEECH
IS MOSTLY ABOUT DAD,

18:58.338 --> 19:01.341
JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HE'S ALWAYS SO HARD ON HIMSELF,
