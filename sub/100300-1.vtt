the number of infected people was

09:00.185 --> 09:03.793
growing every hour we all need to unite

09:03.795 --> 09:07.731
to work together to deal with this

09:07.733 --> 09:11.668
crisis tirelessly conducting checks in

09:11.670 --> 09:16.045
order to catch all the infections at an

09:16.046 --> 09:19.795
early stage this disease is highly

09:19.797 --> 09:23.338
contagious leads anyone infected to an

09:23.339 --> 09:24.853
excruciating death

09:24.855 --> 09:28.698
we are doing everything in our power to

09:28.699 --> 09:32.229
stop it for spreading across our city

09:32.231 --> 09:36.058
there are no recognizable symptoms of

09:36.059 --> 09:37.761
the onset and this infection can only be

09:37.763 --> 09:41.528
detected by a special device the stage 2

09:41.529 --> 09:44.231
of the infection the visual experience

09:44.232 --> 09:46.933
fever and disease in stage 3 emulsions

09:46.935 --> 09:50.183
and hallucinations during the third

09:50.184 --> 09:52.465
stage the victim becomes highly

09:52.467 --> 09:56.889
contagious for the sake of public safety

09:56.890 --> 09:59.623
all infected persons are quarantined and

09:59.625 --> 10:02.405
the pain was lethal injection is

administered before the disease

10:04.954 --> 10:09.203
progresses to stage 3 anyone sheltering

10:09.204 --> 10:12.078
infected persons will be considered a

10:12.079 --> 10:15.510
traitor and will be charged with treason

30:53.498 --> 31:00.467
tell you a story instead deal once upon

31:00.469 --> 31:04.468
a time in a city far far away the people

31:04.469 --> 31:06.640
were very good friends with the

31:06.641 --> 31:08.593
strangers

31:08.595 --> 31:11.829
what are strangers like well they're

31:11.830 --> 31:14.782
like people but but just what the same

31:14.784 --> 31:17.736
as everyone else their eyes glow bright

31:17.737 --> 31:20.844
in different colors the king of the city

31:20.846 --> 31:23.657
he didn't like this and he was a

31:23.659 --> 31:27.659
stranger himself but he wanted his eyes

31:27.661 --> 31:31.504
to glow alone so he banished all the

31:31.505 --> 31:34.909
strangers from the city for one day this

31:34.910 --> 31:37.972
handsome inventor came up with a device

31:37.974 --> 31:40.368
a special machine that could dim the

31:40.368 --> 31:43.285
there was a spur glow anymore but at

31:40.369 --> 31:43.286
glow of the eyes of the strangers now

31:43.286 --> 31:46.203
least people could live together

31:46.205 --> 31:47.672
equal

31:47.674 --> 31:50.610
but the king he didn't want to be equal

31:50.611 --> 31:53.641
with anyone so he ordered the inventor

31:53.643 --> 31:58.392
to give him the machine and then the

31:58.394 --> 32:01.579
inventor refused oh no no no no my

32:01.580 --> 32:04.516

41:53.562 --> 41:55.154

couldn't be worse we better lie low and

41:57.984 --> 42:00.810

single fighter we aren't gonna win we

42:09.844 --> 42:12.453
don't have enough people bail that's

42:12.455 --> 42:14.870

42:14.872 --> 42:16.209
possible

42:19.085 --> 42:21.844
the uprising will begin the day after

45:49.965 --> 45:53.307
they can do for controlling nature any

45:53.308 --> 45:57.277
of the elements you use an overland but

45:57.279 --> 46:01.747
I like the square ones better they work

46:01.748 --> 46:08.841
on objects and my favorite is the

46:08.842 --> 46:12.747
triangular ones they work on people kill

46:12.749 --> 46:17.550
them or kill them for controlling nature

46:17.552 --> 46:22.499
any of the elements you used an over

46:22.500 --> 46:25.874
engine but I like the square ones yes

46:25.876 --> 46:34.210
have a loop let's continue an engine can

46:35.335 --> 46:41.376
even act as an object for example if you

Abby mom I was so worried mom I know

49:53.579 --> 49:57.849
everything the epidemic is a hoax and

49:57.850 --> 50:00.328
the inspectors are taking away the

50:00.330 --> 50:04.173
gifted ones did dad also have a special

50:04.174 --> 50:09.423
gift and what about you I'm not like you

50:09.425 --> 50:12.268
and Jonathan but your father said that

50:12.269 --> 50:16.904
he would make sure that you would be

50:16.906 --> 50:19.445
safe my amulet

50:19.447 --> 50:24.009
dad gave it to me it was during my power

50:24.010 --> 50:27.176
and it saved my life when the inspector

50:27.177 --> 50:29.317
shot me

50:29.319 --> 50:34.662
what when did this happen and don't

50:34.663 --> 50:38.614
worry I'm okay I'm okay how can I not

50:38.616 --> 50:43.021

50:43.023 --> 50:47.678
like this you don't get it we are not

50:47.679 --> 50:51.490
living our own life you can't find work

50:51.492 --> 50:54.928
you're barely surviving I'm supposed to

50:54.930 --> 50:58.523
hide then they took dad away but for

50:58.524 --> 51:02.231
what after all we didn't do anything bad

51:02.233 --> 51:05.148
they deceived us they forced us to be

51:05.150 --> 51:08.884
silent and everyone pretends that it's

51:08.886 --> 51:12.229
the way it should be a whole city of.

51:12.230 --> 51:15.307
Lies and if we put up with lies it means

51:15.309 --> 51:18.589
to be a grave with them to let them do

51:18.591 --> 51:23.028
anything at all with us free is the one

51:23.029 --> 51:26.570
who doesn't lie I will find dad I know

51:26.571 --> 51:27.830
where to look

51:28.216 --> 51:33.496

51:47.187 --> 51:50.280

51:50.281 --> 51:52.967
very big and they know what they're

51:52.969 --> 51:57.343
doing but my intuition tells me that

51:57.344 --> 52:01.729
they're making the mistake we can't

52:01.731 --> 52:04.178
prove it it's just a feeling

52:04.595 --> 52:07.854
just follow you heart my darling

52:07.856 --> 52:12.449

52:12.450 --> 52:15.408
faith in yourself

52:17.191 --> 52:20.430
just be careful

52:48.319 --> 52:56.653
check me I would sugar what are you

53:02.630 --> 53:05.499
inspector take the mask off take it off

53:05.530 --> 53:07.508
if they catch you

53:07.509 --> 53:11.165
that's it maybe we can call them all

53:11.167 --> 53:13.869
over here and all three of you will

53:13.871 --> 53:17.990
dance for me it will be fun stop it at

53:17.991 --> 53:20.781
me what do you need now what is it

53:21.750 --> 53:25.905
sky fortress and what's there

53:25.906 --> 53:28.885
it's a prison for a special was after

53:28.887 --> 53:32.574
they've been caught they brought their

53:32.576 --> 53:35.559
are you sure what if they're being

53:35.561 --> 53:38.185
killed you can't kill the gift it always

53:38.186 --> 53:41.357
returns to the city to awaken in someone

53:41.358 --> 53:46.357
else that's why they built the prison

53:46.359 --> 53:50.566
and my father helped them Abbie leave

53:50.568 --> 53:52.921
now if they catch you what's this

53:52.922 --> 53:54.952
inside that thing there's a guide that

53:54.954 --> 53:57.765
will lead you to the fortress now go

53:57.767 --> 53:59.766
wait you have to take me to the tunnel

53:59.767 --> 54:04.110
the one that leads to the flying machine

54:04.111 --> 54:06.136
and where do you think you'll fly to

54:06.137 --> 54:09.495
Abby beyond the boundaries of this city

54:09.497 --> 54:13.032
there is an unknown and dangerous world

54:13.034 --> 54:16.637
it's suicide to go there alone I won't

54:16.639 --> 54:18.039
be alone

54:18.174 --> 54:21.486
the inspectors are checking the tunnels

54:21.488 --> 54:24.732
the only way to get the room is during

54:24.734 --> 54:28.280
the shift change at dawn or at midnight

54:28.281 --> 54:31.452
then we meet here half an hour before

54:31.453 --> 54:32.728
midnight

54:40.750 --> 54:45.822
well I don't want to lose you not you

54:45.824 --> 54:48.479
not any of the others Stella you

54:48.480 --> 54:52.152
understand true many of our people have

54:52.154 --> 54:53.950
been taken in we can only defeat them on

54:53.951 --> 54:57.106
public safety day when they're spread

54:57.107 --> 54:58.731
around the city if we don't strike

54:58.733 --> 55:01.388
tomorrow your pricing is finished it's

55:01.389 --> 55:03.273
our only chance

55:03.275 --> 55:05.159
end of discussion

55:10.066 --> 55:13.377
we attack at dawn our troops will gather

55:13.379 --> 55:17.315
here they'll wait there is no need for

55:17.317 --> 55:20.817
an uprising this is the place where they

55:20.819 --> 55:22.740
hold everyone who was taken from the

55:22.741 --> 55:25.380
city we can get there on the supplying

55:25.382 --> 55:29.682
machine and if we free them they will

55:29.683 --> 55:34.246
help us shut up I give the orders here

55:34.247 --> 55:36.329
you can either follow them or get out

55:36.331 --> 55:39.507
but I know a way out of the city if we

55:39.509 --> 55:40.898
leave this city

55:40.899 --> 55:43.648
we won't stand a chance who are we going

55:43.650 --> 55:45.852
to find there anyway half of them were

55:45.853 --> 55:47.883
working for the authorities when they

55:47.885 --> 55:49.837
were taken whoever they are I will not

55:49.838 --> 55:51.915
entrust the future of this city and the

55:51.916 --> 55:55.165
resistance to them look even she doesn't

55:55.167 --> 55:57.119
want to go with you we need to talk us

55:57.120 --> 55:59.806
through talk what's through how we're

55:59.808 --> 56:03.135
going to leave behind everyone living in

56:03.136 --> 56:06.104
the city know how to stay alive we are

56:06.106 --> 56:08.636
at war and I'm willing already to

56:08.637 --> 56:11.417
sacrifice any life including my own for

56:11.419 --> 56:13.209
the sake of victory and if you're not

56:13.211 --> 56:14.845
ready for that

56:14.846 --> 56:16.480

56:22.889 --> 56:25.841
reason you want to go out from the city

56:40.948 --> 56:42.951
parents your father

56:42.953 --> 56:46.732

56:46.734 --> 56:50.484
gave them the device which they used to

56:50.485 --> 56:56.308
identify and take off our friends

58:40.874 --> 58:46.737
Jonathan did well hiding you from us

58:46.738 --> 58:50.706

your father didn't want you to have any

58:53.778 --> 58:55.667
powers

58:55.668 --> 58:59.297
he realized that certain people should

58:59.299 --> 59:03.157
not be more powerful than others and he

59:03.159 --> 59:07.846
designed a device that can make

59:07.847 --> 59:10.876
everybody equal you do believe in what

59:10.878 --> 59:14.925
your father was trying to achieve don't

59:26.265 --> 59:30.139
of equals we're honest work and common

59:30.140 --> 59:34.109
decency are held the highest not some

59:34.111 --> 59:38.854
random gift of magic powers blind and

59:38.855 --> 59:41.723
undeserved are you trying to recruit me

59:51.289 --> 59:55.111
chance to make up for what you've done

59:55.112 --> 01:00:01.675

01:00:01.936 --> 01:00:10.270

01:03:14.095 --> 01:03:19.980
make this infusion now come on you can

01:03:19.982 --> 01:03:28.316
make it more here take it

01:03:29.004 --> 01:03:34.534
tap this guy I grew it I dried it

01:03:34.536 --> 01:03:40.661
infused it and now it's all gone

01:03:55.361 --> 01:03:59.016
they'll forgive me please

01:03:59.018 --> 01:04:03.736
keep it's mine where did you go with

01:04:03.737 --> 01:04:06.909
that inspector is this instead of thank

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.127
you thank you for what

01:04:09.129 --> 01:04:11.972
normal scars both killed because you

01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:14.879
wouldn't listen to me it's you should

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.978
listen to me I shouldn't because I saved

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:19.545
your life

01:04:19.547 --> 01:04:22.832
actually I thank you if you would not

01:04:22.834 --> 01:04:24.458
gone there I would have had to risk

01:04:24.459 --> 01:04:27.416
everything for you can you listen to me

01:04:27.418 --> 01:04:30.063
for once

01:04:30.064 --> 01:04:32.708
there's another way how did you get my

01:04:32.709 --> 01:04:35.708
father left it for me and inside of it

01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:38.460
there is a guide who can lead us to the

01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:41.147
ones who are taken by the inspectors

01:04:41.149 --> 01:04:45.882
stop don't open it

01:04:45.884 --> 01:04:50.616
why not they're called fairies before

01:04:50.618 --> 01:04:53.837
the boundary was built they lived in the

01:04:53.838 --> 01:04:56.196
city with a gift at once but the

01:04:56.198 --> 01:04:59.337
inspectors forced them into service but

01:04:59.339 --> 01:05:02.807
why don't you want it to be seen by

01:05:02.808 --> 01:05:06.088
everybody because now fairies are part

01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:11.110
of a different world and we have to save

01:05:11.111 --> 01:05:13.869
ours this is what I'm fighting apart

01:05:13.871 --> 01:05:17.308
never since Garrett killed my parents

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:19.027
I'm sorry but revenge won't bring them

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:21.929
back but we can still see those who are

01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:23.111
alive

01:05:23.341 --> 01:05:26.694
understand this as soon as we cross the

01:05:26.695 --> 01:05:31.080
boundary we will want to stay there and

01:05:31.082 --> 01:05:35.163
no one will care about this city we have

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:39.337
to liberate it if you're thinking only

01:05:39.339 --> 01:05:43.088
about your father yes I haven't seen him

01:05:43.089 --> 01:05:46.145
for 10 years and I don't know if he's

01:05:46.147 --> 01:05:47.341
still alive

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:51.531
and I follow my duty

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:56.135
your faith is no foundation maybe it

01:05:56.137 --> 01:05:59.312
needs no foundation but we should just

01:05:59.313 --> 01:06:04.104
follow our hearts my heart wants you to

01:06:04.105 --> 01:06:09.792
stay here in safety I can't stay here no

01:06:09.793 --> 01:06:13.126
matter how much I want to

01:06:18.858 --> 01:06:23.098
you and I are on different paths.

01:06:29.932 --> 01:06:33.327
I have no right to hold you here

01:06:33.329 --> 01:06:36.005
and I hope

01:06:36.006 --> 01:06:42.016
you will change your mind

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:56.746
something flash just like a fire that's

01:06:56.748 --> 01:07:03.862
not how fire burns but how does it burn

01:07:03.864 --> 01:07:08.655
well in order to light a flame you need

01:07:08.656 --> 01:07:14.771
three friends now the first friends is

01:07:17.959 --> 01:07:22.437
and a few is what will burn but the

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:30.773
second friend is and will feed the fire

01:07:31.336 --> 01:07:37.689
but the third friend is a spark and she

01:07:37.691 --> 01:07:41.284
likes to play fool around just like you

01:07:41.285 --> 01:07:43.252
and without her

01:07:43.254 --> 01:07:47.472
air and fuel can't be deflate their

01:07:47.473 --> 01:07:51.754
friends but they do everything together

01:07:51.756 --> 01:07:54.505
just like life you have to find two

01:07:54.507 --> 01:07:57.834
friends with which you can overcome any

01:07:57.835 --> 01:08:01.266
obstacle because alone you won't get

01:08:01.268 --> 01:08:02.433
very far

01:10:15.856 --> 01:10:18.802
there are too many inspectors it came

01:10:18.804 --> 01:10:22.013
from beyond the boundary

01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:09.247
confused

01:14:09.249 --> 01:14:12.238
aren't you

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.652
you would have had us all killed but I

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:20.678
found the only sensible solution more

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.470
like saving everyone's back

01:14:30.586 --> 01:14:33.292
it hurts me so much

01:14:33.294 --> 01:14:36.440
to see how the man I loved

01:14:36.441 --> 01:14:38.418
obsessed fanatic

01:14:38.419 --> 01:14:42.524
all these years you've been toxicated by

01:14:42.526 --> 01:14:43.909
thirst for power

01:14:44.649 --> 01:14:48.658
you've drawn the whole city in blood

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:52.984
you're kind of teir would be something

01:14:52.986 --> 01:14:54.994
the inspectors could never have imagined

01:14:55.068 --> 01:14:59.219
but it was you throughout the city of

01:14:59.221 --> 01:15:01.089
blood enough

01:15:01.517 --> 01:15:04.631
take it away

01:15:38.397 --> 01:15:40.311
what are you doing

01:15:40.313 --> 01:15:43.718
we lost it's the end the inspectors will

01:15:43.719 --> 01:15:46.923
be here soon yeah but what about our

01:15:46.925 --> 01:15:50.408
friends the ones that have been taken

01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:54.544
prisoner we have to get them out why are

01:15:54.546 --> 01:15:58.587
you giving up you don't have to give up

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:01.087
we still have a chance to fix everything

01:16:44.332 --> 01:16:48.623
we can all run off and hide now but

01:16:48.624 --> 01:16:51.904
that's not right and we can only win if

01:16:51.906 --> 01:16:56.510
we believe in what we are fighting for

01:16:56.512 --> 01:16:58.593
this is our chance

01:16:58.594 --> 01:17:01.343
we'll get out of the city and save our

01:17:01.345 --> 01:17:05.584
friends we'll find all of our kind

01:17:05.585 --> 01:17:08.375
everyone who was taken by the inspectors

01:17:08.377 --> 01:17:10.282
and this Barry

01:17:10.283 --> 01:17:13.773
will show us the way to us.

01:17:30.097 --> 01:17:34.160
I have no right to tell you what to do

01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:38.566
you should all decide for yourselves but

01:17:38.568 --> 01:17:42.129
I'm going and if the words hope and

01:17:42.131 --> 01:17:45.441
freedom mean anything to you then come

01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:53.777
with me

01:18:08.363 --> 01:18:12.341
you have to come with us Spencer I'm an

01:18:12.343 --> 01:18:18.592
old man what am I gonna do this is my

01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:24.906
home and I love this city and I've grown

01:18:24.907 --> 01:18:30.333
so fond of this basement

01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:34.490
I'm staying no please you have to come

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:38.553
with us my dear a be sure you can manage

01:18:38.555 --> 01:18:41.576
without me.

01:18:50.442 --> 01:18:53.649
I remembered my name after all

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:57.733
and I have never forget

01:21:13.198 --> 01:21:16.948
what's the tunnel

01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:22.981
it looks like we're inside the flying

01:21:22.982 --> 01:21:25.865
machine no I mean can you make him fly

01:21:25.867 --> 01:21:29.501
what a strange women why aren't they

01:21:29.503 --> 01:21:35.774
wearing masks figure out how to fly this

01:22:24.499 --> 01:22:27.624
look

01:23:38.237 --> 01:23:42.217
when I was little my dad used to tell me

01:23:42.219 --> 01:23:46.781
a story about outsiders who

01:23:46.782 --> 01:23:49.894
beyond the boundary I'm scared what if I

01:23:49.896 --> 01:23:53.781
was wrong and we're flying into a trap

01:23:53.783 --> 01:23:56.329
what if you're right and when we get

01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:59.188
there we're only going to find traitors

01:23:59.189 --> 01:24:01.662
working for the security department and

01:24:01.664 --> 01:24:04.835
what if my father is working for the

01:24:04.836 --> 01:24:08.710
inspectors too it doesn't matter what we

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:12.137
find what only matters is that we have a

01:24:12.139 --> 01:24:14.159
new hope and it's driving us forward

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:17.174
you're all here only because you have

01:24:17.176 --> 01:24:19.982
faith in what your heart was telling you

01:24:19.984 --> 01:24:21.795
give me your answer

01:24:28.692 --> 01:24:31.817
concentrate

01:24:33.952 --> 01:24:37.379
trust your power

01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:43.496
the Ewing

01:24:48.079 --> 01:24:56.413
must have faith in yourself

01:25:22.354 --> 01:25:28.301
the engine stopped working we don't have

01:25:28.303 --> 01:25:31.939
a choice we have to go there and see

01:25:31.941 --> 01:25:33.293
what's going on

01:26:53.179 --> 01:26:56.606
who the hell are you

01:27:10.879 --> 01:27:13.440
okay everybody spread out search the

01:27:13.442 --> 01:27:16.400
building for Johnson

01:27:33.278 --> 01:27:38.778
don't touch him he's barely alive

01:27:40.122 --> 01:27:43.225
looks like his life force has been

01:27:43.227 --> 01:27:46.039
sucked out of him we searched the whole

01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:48.269
place

01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:50.217
Jonathan Foster's not here

01:27:53.874 --> 01:27:58.062
my father's not here

01:28:07.094 --> 01:28:10.593
you were right my father created the

01:28:10.595 --> 01:28:14.246
device that takes away the powers from

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:17.136
those who have them when I was little he

01:28:17.138 --> 01:28:20.173
gave her an amulet that suppressed my

01:28:20.175 --> 01:28:23.169
abilities but this device is much more

01:28:23.170 --> 01:28:24.460
powerful

01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:35.544
well it's not that simple

01:28:35.546 --> 01:28:39.166
looks like we need all our powers to

01:28:39.167 --> 01:28:42.114
destroy it well we've lost them we need

01:28:42.115 --> 01:28:43.671
to have a look around let's go

01:30:14.371 --> 01:30:22.475
dad daddy I was looking for you for so

01:30:22.476 --> 01:30:26.287
long I've gone through so much well well

01:30:26.289 --> 01:30:34.623
a be quiet now I am here where are we

01:30:38.874 --> 01:30:42.227
it's like my memories you're on the

01:30:42.228 --> 01:30:45.852
right path navigator I looked at the

01:30:45.854 --> 01:30:54.188
watch and I ended up here engine what

01:30:58.979 --> 01:31:02.510
did you act upon me but what did he do

01:31:02.512 --> 01:31:05.219
what for

01:31:05.221 --> 01:31:08.793
remember I can only point you in the

01:31:08.794 --> 01:31:15.606
right direction I just wanted you to

01:31:15.607 --> 01:31:22.731
come back it's just a recording oh you

01:31:22.733 --> 01:31:28.691
put the sentences into my memories hints

01:31:28.692 --> 01:31:32.285
anything can happen

01:31:32.287 --> 01:31:35.702
even things that can't all you need to

01:31:35.703 --> 01:31:40.672
do is to believe now keep your head up

01:31:40.673 --> 01:31:46.757
hyah hyah Cupid hi

01:31:50.548 --> 01:31:53.349
keep your head up

01:31:53.351 --> 01:31:57.404
that's what he always used to tell me

01:31:59.936 --> 01:32:04.258
look miss Sara was going there

01:32:04.259 --> 01:32:07.311
there must be something

01:32:25.929 --> 01:32:34.263
son be the shining on that wall

01:32:58.047 --> 01:33:03.577
did you leave me a hint Abigail my joy

01:33:03.579 --> 01:33:05.244
you're here

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:09.557
I found the board how can I turn off the

01:33:09.559 --> 01:33:12.762
device that takes away the power from

01:33:12.764 --> 01:33:16.773
the special ones I can only point you in

01:33:16.775 --> 01:33:19.175
the right direction remember what I said

01:33:21.957 --> 01:33:27.550
he said something about three friends I

01:33:27.551 --> 01:33:29.529
need three things

01:33:29.530 --> 01:33:37.864
whoa whoa stop you drew

01:33:48.293 --> 01:33:51.771
their engines engines of all different

01:33:51.773 --> 01:33:55.459
kinds Bravo right on the nose

01:33:55.461 --> 01:33:58.574
they all do everything together that

01:33:58.576 --> 01:34:01.648
means that we've got to somehow bring

01:34:01.649 --> 01:34:05.566
them together ah I kept it the sunbeams.

01:34:05.567 --> 01:34:06.857
I

01:34:12.233 --> 01:34:15.108
We need to combine the beams from three

01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:18.670
types of engines put the engines

01:34:18.672 --> 01:34:22.537
together so that they point at the lungs

01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:25.672
if you focus their beams into a single

01:34:25.673 --> 01:34:27.078
beam

01:34:27.079 --> 01:34:30.537
that will destroy the device

01:34:32.027 --> 01:34:34.746
having Norman inspectors will be here

01:34:34.747 --> 01:34:37.012
soon

01:34:37.014 --> 01:34:40.013
fail my dad knew that I would come here

01:34:40.014 --> 01:34:43.247
he left some clues for me to show how to

01:34:43.249 --> 01:34:46.029
neutralize the device and bring our

01:34:46.031 --> 01:34:48.810
power back though we need time okay

01:34:48.811 --> 01:34:51.841
we'll buy some time for you Norman help

01:34:51.843 --> 01:34:54.082
Abby

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:37.374
dad what are you trying to tell me dad I

01:37:40.603 --> 01:37:44.455
did everything you said but the engines

01:37:44.457 --> 01:37:49.978
not work I found the mirror any engines

01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:52.947
but without the power nothing will work

01:37:52.948 --> 01:37:55.792
where are you

01:37:55.793 --> 01:38:04.127
quiet em again I mean I'm here with you

01:38:31.110 --> 01:38:33.963
have you done

01:38:33.964 --> 01:38:37.286
and why should I do

01:38:37.288 --> 01:38:40.397
so that you can read the world not just

01:38:40.398 --> 01:38:44.444
of the special ones but of their gift as

01:38:44.446 --> 01:38:48.382
well so that you can have a weapon that

01:38:48.384 --> 01:38:52.319
could destroy the gift itself because it

01:38:52.321 --> 01:38:56.154
was my request

01:38:57.123 --> 01:39:03.726
it's your order be honest Garrett what's

01:39:03.728 --> 01:39:06.414
wrong Jonathan we're colleagues after

01:39:06.416 --> 01:39:14.750
all the equality that we achieved

01:39:15.167 --> 01:39:21.573
izabel only power can change and I have

01:39:21.574 --> 01:39:25.510
this power the power is me it doesn't

01:39:25.512 --> 01:39:29.761
belong to anyone one day I will become

01:39:29.763 --> 01:39:33.168
part of this power it will return and

01:39:33.170 --> 01:39:37.263
awaken in everyone this will be a city

01:39:37.264 --> 01:39:43.254
of equals of the strong not a weak

01:39:44.077 --> 01:39:47.482
just do what I asked you to and don't

01:39:47.484 --> 01:39:51.702
forget about your daughter think about

01:39:51.703 --> 01:39:53.911
her

01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:58.120
yes

01:39:58.881 --> 01:40:04.879
yes you're right I have a daughter and I

01:40:04.881 --> 01:40:10.162
think of her everything and that is why

01:40:10.164 --> 01:40:12.810
I say

01:40:13.498 --> 01:40:17.423
not this

01:40:17.424 --> 01:40:20.226
time

01:40:47.762 --> 01:40:51.406
and you have to go back to you soon

01:40:51.407 --> 01:40:58.252
because the only way

01:41:09.066 --> 01:41:12.160
it's only in my memories destroy the

01:41:12.161 --> 01:41:16.922
device

01:41:18.579 --> 01:41:26.913
so much

01:42:17.628 --> 01:42:23.638
go back to myself I get it I know how to

01:42:23.639 --> 01:42:31.973
do it

01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:56.650
as a child I had special powers and my

01:42:56.652 --> 01:42:59.887
dad taught me to summon them from inside

01:42:59.889 --> 01:43:03.831
myself

01:45:24.047 --> 01:45:32.381
we mustn't talk about that everything is

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.183
