WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:06.507
( minor-key organ
music playing )

00:08.579 --> 00:11.282
Stan: IT WAS A
DARK AND STORMY NIGHT,

00:11.282 --> 00:15.286
AND THE TALKING DOG
WAS HOLDING A FLASHLIGHT.

00:15.286 --> 00:16.547
WAIT A SECOND.

00:16.547 --> 00:19.120
IT'S A BLOG.
NO ONE CAN SEE ME.

00:23.154 --> 00:24.555
I'VE NEVER QUITE
UNDERSTOOD HALLOWEEN.

00:24.555 --> 00:26.797
WHY DO PEOPLE GET
SO EXCITED ABOUT DRESSING UP

00:26.797 --> 00:29.560
TO BEG FOR TREATS?
I BEG FOR TREATS EVERY DAY,

00:29.560 --> 00:31.762
AND I DON'T HAVE
TO WEAR MAKEUP TO DO IT.

00:31.762 --> 00:34.505
UNLESS I WANT TO FEEL PRETTY.

00:34.505 --> 00:35.506
( thunder crashes )

00:35.506 --> 00:38.509
( screaming )

00:38.509 --> 00:41.342
I DIDN'T HIT SAVE!

00:41.342 --> 00:43.174
♪♪

00:43.174 --> 00:45.546
WHERE IS AVERY?
SHOULD WE START WITHOUT HER?

00:45.546 --> 00:48.449
UH, TYLER, WE CANNOT
PLAN HALLOWEEN WITHOUT AVERY.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.181
AVERY IS HALLOWEEN.

00:50.181 --> 00:51.582
SHE DOES PLAN
AN AMAZING PARTY.

00:51.582 --> 00:53.684
HER EFFECTS WERE
SO REALISTIC LAST YEAR

00:53.684 --> 00:55.556
WE STILL CAN'T GET
THOSE GHOST HUNTERS
TO LEAVE US ALONE.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.189
GET OUT OF HERE!

00:59.590 --> 01:02.563
SORRY I'M LATE. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE MY HEAD IS AT.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.365
Bennet:
WHOA! WHOA!

01:05.396 --> 01:07.398
( laughing
and cheering )

01:07.398 --> 01:09.340
AVERY, YOU'RE
AN AWESOME PRANKSTER

01:09.340 --> 01:10.841
AND A HALLOWEEN GENIUS.

01:10.841 --> 01:16.076
AND LIKE THE CANDY
WE GET ON HALLOWEEN,
YOU'RE FUN SIZE.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.149
AVERY, I HOPE YOUR PLANS
ARE AMAZING THIS YEAR.

01:18.149 --> 01:19.680
YEAH, BECAUSE LAST YEAR
WAS SO INCREDIBLE,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.552
NOW EVERYONE WANTS TO COME.

01:22.553 --> 01:25.286
WILL YOU GET OUT OF HERE!
WE ARE ALL ALIVE!

01:26.557 --> 01:28.559
YEAH, AVERY,
THIS PARTY BETTER BE GREAT

01:28.559 --> 01:31.122
'CAUSE I'M COUNTING
ON ALL THE CUTE GIRLS
I'M INVITING GETTING

01:31.122 --> 01:34.195
SCARED SO I CAN
COMFORT THEM.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.327
I'M COUNTING ON ALL THE BOYS
I WAS FORCED TO INCLUDE

01:36.327 --> 01:38.199
GETTING SCARED
SO THEY'LL RUN AWAY.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.330
I DON'T LIKE BOYS.

01:39.330 --> 01:42.833
OR PEOPLE WHO FORCE ME
TO INCLUDE THEM.

01:42.833 --> 01:45.476
ALL RIGHT,
HALLOWEEN IS DAYS AWAY,

01:45.476 --> 01:47.338
AND AS MEMBERS
OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE,

01:47.338 --> 01:49.680
HERE ARE YOUR ASSIGNMENTS.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.483
MOM, STAY OUT OF MY WAY.
DAD, STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

01:52.483 --> 01:54.615
TYLER, STAY OUT OF MY WAY.
CHLOE, YOU'RE MY ASSISTANT.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.648
YES! WHAT DO I DO?
STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

01:57.648 --> 02:00.551
BUT I'M THE SENIOR VP
OF SKELETONS, EYEBALLS,

02:00.551 --> 02:01.652
AND "WOO" SOUNDS.

02:01.652 --> 02:03.754
DAD, THAT WAS JUST
A FIGUREHEAD POSITION.

02:03.754 --> 02:04.895
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

02:04.895 --> 02:07.658
BUT IT MEANT SOMETHING TO ME.

02:07.658 --> 02:09.430
SO, AREN'T YOU EVEN
GOING TO TELL US
WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING?

02:09.430 --> 02:12.403
WELL, AFTER LAST YEAR
WHEN CHLOE SPOILED
THE SURPRISE THAT

02:12.403 --> 02:14.465
THE WITCH WOULD BE
VOMITING PEA SOUP
ON EVERYONE

02:14.465 --> 02:16.567
AS THEY WALKED BY,
EVERYTHING IS NOW

02:16.567 --> 02:19.710
ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS.
AND WHAT DID I TELL YOU,
CHLOE?

02:19.710 --> 02:22.713
SNITCHES HURT WITCHES.

02:22.713 --> 02:25.416
FINE, AVERY.
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

02:25.416 --> 02:26.577
AND I'M NOT JUST
SAYING THAT BECAUSE

02:26.577 --> 02:29.580
I'M HOPING TO BE CONSIDERED
AS THE NEW VP OF "WOO" SOUNDS.

02:29.580 --> 02:34.154
I JUST HAVE ONE REQUEST:
THAT STAN STAYS OUTSIDE
FOR THE PARTY.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.528
WE DON'T WANT HIM RUNNING
TO THE FRONT DOOR BARKING
EVERY TIME THE DOORBELL RINGS.

02:37.528 --> 02:39.660
I CAN'T TALK IN FRONT OF HER,
I CAN'T BARK,

02:39.660 --> 02:43.534
I CAN'T WEAR HER NIGHTGOWNS.
WHAT CAN I DO?

02:43.534 --> 02:45.536
WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE
AT THE PARTY SO MUCH?

02:45.536 --> 02:46.937
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT HALLOWEEN.

02:46.937 --> 02:49.470
I CARE EVEN LESS FOR
BEING LOCKED OUTSIDE

02:49.470 --> 02:50.801
WHILE EVERYONE
ELSE GOES WILD.

02:50.801 --> 02:53.644
IT'S LIKE BEING THE CASHIER
AT AN ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BUFFET.

02:55.206 --> 02:57.608
STAN, MOM DOESN'T
WANT YOU IN THE HOUSE.

02:57.608 --> 03:00.251
UNLESS SHE DOESN'T
KNOW THAT IT'S YOU.

03:00.251 --> 03:04.555
EASY. I'LL CHANGE MY NAME.
CAPTAIN AMERICA.

03:04.555 --> 03:07.218
STAN, YOU CAN'T CHANGE
YOUR NAME TO CAPTAIN AMERICA.

03:07.218 --> 03:08.559
WHAT, IT'S NOT
A FREE COUNTRY?

03:08.559 --> 03:11.692
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS FOR.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.724
WELL, I WAS THINKING
MORE LIKE A COSTUME.

03:13.724 --> 03:16.697
GREAT IDEA. I KNOW
JUST WHAT TO WEAR.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.971
GET IT? I'M A HOT DOG!

03:20.971 --> 03:24.535
STAN, THE POINT IS
TO WEAR A COSTUME THAT
DISGUISES WHO YOU ARE.

03:24.535 --> 03:25.706
GOT IT.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.410
LOOK AT ME.
I'M AN ITALIAN SAUSAGE.

03:47.558 --> 03:48.799
HEY, GUYS. CHECK THIS OUT.

03:50.961 --> 03:52.963
( laughing )

03:55.636 --> 03:57.438
YOU REALIZE THAT HE'S
AT LEAST THE HUNDREDTH KID

03:57.438 --> 03:58.709
WHO'S DONE THAT IN
THE LAST THREE DAYS?

03:58.709 --> 04:01.572
YEAH, BUT HE'S THE FIRST
ONE TO MAKE IT WORK.

04:01.572 --> 04:04.445
WELL, HERE'S A ZANY IDEA.
WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO HIM?

04:04.445 --> 04:05.846
YEAH, THE LAST TIME
I TRIED THAT,

04:05.846 --> 04:08.619
I ACCIDENTALLY EMBARRASSED HIM
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL

04:08.619 --> 04:10.981
AND NOW HE WANTS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

04:10.981 --> 04:13.253
I JUST HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
THAT WE BOTH HAVE IN COMMON.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.656
FOR EXAMPLE,
HE'S ALWAYS LOVED FOOTBALL.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.959
SO STARTING TODAY,
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED FOOTBALL.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.392
NAME TWO TEAMS.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.794
HOME AND AWAY.

04:23.794 --> 04:25.736
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU
CHANGING ABOUT YOURSELF?

04:25.736 --> 04:28.268
I'M VERY INTO STEAMPUNK,
WHATEVER THAT IS.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.342
OKAY, SO HERE'S
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

04:31.342 --> 04:34.705
LINDSAY, WHEN HE HEADS TO CLASS,
YOU THROW ME THIS FOOTBALL

04:34.705 --> 04:35.976
AND I'LL CATCH IT RIGHT
IN FRONT OF HIM.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.810
YEP, NOTHING REELS IN A GUY
LIKE HAND-EYE COORDINATION.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.682
OOH, OOH, I'M GOING LONG!

04:41.682 --> 04:43.053
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:43.053 --> 04:44.715
I DON'T KNOW, JUST THROW IT!

04:47.518 --> 04:49.560
AVERY!

04:51.662 --> 04:53.364
DID I CATCH THE BALL?
NO.

04:53.364 --> 04:54.965
DID WES NOTICE ME?
NO.

04:54.965 --> 04:57.668
GOOD.

04:57.668 --> 04:59.630
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING YOU HAVE

04:59.630 --> 05:01.372
IN COMMON,
HE LOVES HALLOWEEN.

05:01.372 --> 05:02.703
ISN'T THAT, LIKE,
YOUR BIG THING?

05:02.703 --> 05:04.835
LINDSAY, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME THIS

05:04.835 --> 05:07.007
BEFORE I FACE-PLANTED
INTO THE LOCKER?

05:07.007 --> 05:10.441
I WAS EXCITED. I'VE NEVER
THROWN A FOOTBALL BEFORE.

05:10.441 --> 05:13.444
I'M STILL NOT SURE
YOU'VE THROWN A FOOTBALL.

05:13.444 --> 05:16.487
HE LOVES HALLOWEEN?
HOW DID I MISS THAT?

05:16.487 --> 05:18.018
I MUST HAVE BEEN
TOO BUSY LOOKING FORWARD

05:18.018 --> 05:20.721
TO SAINT PATRICK'S DAY.
I WASN'T GOING TO WEAR GREEN

05:20.721 --> 05:22.993
AND HE WAS GOING TO PINCH ME
AND WE'D BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

05:22.993 --> 05:24.595
SIMPLE.

05:24.595 --> 05:27.558
ALL I KNOW IS I OVERHEARD
HIM TELL DWIGHT CHANDLER

05:27.558 --> 05:30.561
THAT HE LOVES HALLOWEEN AND
CAN'T WAIT TO GO TO HIS PARTY.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.563
YOU GUYS, THIS IS PERFECT.

05:32.563 --> 05:35.706
I'LL GO TO DWIGHT CHANDLER'S
PARTY AND TOTALLY CONNECT

05:35.706 --> 05:37.538
WITH WES OVER OUR
LOVE OF HALLOWEEN.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.039
( chuckles )
'CAUSE I SURE CAN'T
CONNECT WITH HIM

05:39.039 --> 05:41.512
OVER THE FACT THAT
WE BOTH WALK TO HIS
HOUSE AFTER SCHOOL,

05:41.512 --> 05:45.015
HIM ON THE SIDEWALK
AND ME DUCKING BEHIND
BUSHES AND CARS.

05:46.477 --> 05:47.978
OH, SO WHAT SHOULD
MY COSTUME BE?

05:47.978 --> 05:49.750
I NEED SOMETHING
CUTE BUT SCARY.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.483
HOW ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.557
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:57.988 --> 05:59.590
OH, YOU'RE A MER-DOG.

05:59.590 --> 06:05.466
NO, I'M RUFF SEAS.
RUFF SEAS? COME ON!

06:05.466 --> 06:07.468
STAN, I THOUGHT
THE POINT IS THAT
YOU DON'T WANT MOM

06:07.468 --> 06:08.839
AND DAD TO CATCH YOU
AT THE PARTY.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.741
YOU NEED TO BE
COMPLETELY HIDDEN.

06:10.741 --> 06:12.903
RIGHT.
WAIT A MINUTE,

06:12.903 --> 06:16.547
IF I'M IN A COSTUME
WHERE NO ONE KNOWS
I'M EVEN A DOG,

06:16.547 --> 06:20.651
THAT MEANS I COULD
TALK TO PEOPLE.
I COULD TALK TO ANYONE!

06:20.651 --> 06:22.583
I COULD EVEN TALK
TO BENNETT AND ELLEN.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.715
AH, IT'S OVERRATED.

06:24.715 --> 06:26.917
I HAVE A QUESTION
I'M DYING TO ASK
EACH OF THEM.

06:26.917 --> 06:29.059
BUT I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION
I'M DYING TO ASK YOU.

06:29.059 --> 06:32.092
WHY ARE YOU
DRESSED LIKE CHLOE?
I'M NOT DRESSED LIKE CHL--

06:34.094 --> 06:37.568
CHLOE, YOU CAN'T GO
AS A FORTUNE TELLER.
THAT'S MY THING.

06:37.568 --> 06:40.771
I'M GONNA TELL THE
GIRLS AT THE PARTY THAT
I CAN SEE THEIR DESTINY.

06:40.771 --> 06:42.703
YOU WILL HAVE A DATE

06:42.703 --> 06:44.705
WITH A TALL,
DARK FORTUNE TELLER.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.878
I SEE FAILURE
IN YOUR FUTURE.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.142
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A FORTUNE TELLER TO SEE THAT.

06:54.084 --> 06:56.887
I KNOW YOU'RE
CHECKING OUT MY TAIL.

06:56.887 --> 07:01.151
ELLEN, I WILL ASK THE KIDS WHICH
ONE OF US GETS TO WEAR--OH.

07:01.151 --> 07:02.923
BENNETT, WE NEED TO DECIDE
WHICH ONE OF US--

07:02.923 --> 07:05.626
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.759
WE'RE FORTUNE TELLERS.
HOW DID NONE OF US
SEE THIS COMING?

07:08.759 --> 07:12.663
I AM THE ONLY ONE COMING
EVEN CLOSE TO THE ACCENT.

07:13.804 --> 07:16.607
AND YOU GUYS MAKE FUN
OF MY GOLD CLOGS.

07:18.569 --> 07:21.111
SO, UM, I KIND OF HAVE
SOME BAD NEWS.

07:21.111 --> 07:23.173
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO GO TO OUR FAMILY PARTY.

07:23.173 --> 07:25.445
I'M GOING TO DWIGHT CHANDLER'S
WITH MY FRIENDS.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.649
WHAT? AVERY, YOU HAVE BEEN
PLANNING THIS PARTY FOR MONTHS.

07:28.649 --> 07:32.022
YOU MADE ME BUY HUNDREDS
OF DOLLARS OF SNAKE INTESTINES.

07:32.022 --> 07:33.624
THEY'RE IN THE GARAGE
AND THEY'RE STARTING TO STINK.

07:33.624 --> 07:36.727
I SAID FAKE INTESTINES.

07:36.727 --> 07:38.859
SO WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE SHEEP EYES?

07:38.859 --> 07:41.762
I SAID CHEAP PIES.

07:41.762 --> 07:47.638
OH. THAT EXPLAINS
THE SUGGESTION TO SERVE
THEM WARM WITH ICE CREAM.

07:47.638 --> 07:49.199
LOOK, I CAN HELP YOU
GUYS SET UP THE PARTY,

07:49.199 --> 07:50.901
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
RUN EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN.

07:50.901 --> 07:53.473
I'M NOT GONNA BE HERE.
WHOA, WHOA,
I'M SORRY, AVERY,

07:53.473 --> 07:56.146
BUT YOU ARE GOING BE HERE.
WE CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.

07:56.146 --> 07:59.510
SETTING UP IS NOT ENOUGH.
WE CAN'T PULL THIS STUFF
OFF LIKE YOU CAN.

07:59.510 --> 08:01.481
ARE YOU FORGETTING
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I TRIED

08:01.481 --> 08:03.814
TO DO YOUR "HEAD FALLING OFF"
BIT AND GOT STUCK?

08:03.814 --> 08:06.687
( grunting )
WHY WON'T IT COME UNSTUCK?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.759
AVERY MADE IT LOOK SO EASY!

08:08.759 --> 08:11.962
( sighs ) I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GET A JOB IN A BELL TOWER.

08:11.962 --> 08:14.094
SEE, AVERY? WE NEED YOU.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.627
WELL, I NEED TO GO
TO DWIGHT'S PARTY.

08:16.627 --> 08:19.099
WES IS GONNA BE THERE.
WHO'S WES?

08:19.099 --> 08:23.103
OH, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT!

08:23.103 --> 08:25.736
AVERY, YOU SENT FLIERS
TO ALL OUR NEIGHBORS.

08:25.736 --> 08:28.238
WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING.
FORGET PEOPLE.

08:28.238 --> 08:33.013
I HAVE GIRLS COMING
AND I'M DRESSED LIKE MY MOM.

08:33.013 --> 08:37.548
I HAVE BOYS COMING.
THANKS AGAIN, MOMMY. YUCK.

08:37.548 --> 08:39.720
PLEASE. IF MY HAPPINESS
MEANS ANYTHING TO YOU--

08:39.720 --> 08:41.822
THERE ARE GOING
TO BE A LOT OF BOYS
IN YOUR LIFE, AVERY.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.154
NO, NO, THERE NOT.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.557
PLUS, YOU MADE
A COMMITMENT TO THIS FAMILY.

08:46.557 --> 08:49.700
AND TO ALL OF OUR FRIENDS.
I MEAN, WE DON'T BAIL

08:49.700 --> 08:51.762
JUST BECAUSE WE GET
A BETTER OFFER.

08:51.762 --> 08:53.704
YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION
TO GO TO THAT PARTY.

08:53.704 --> 08:56.106
THIS IS SO UNFAIR!

08:56.106 --> 08:57.668
YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE UNFAIR?

08:57.668 --> 09:00.771
A HOUSEFUL OF GUESTS EATING
SHEEP EYES A LA MODE

09:00.771 --> 09:02.643
AND NOT ONE OF THEM
IS COVERED IN WITCH PUKE.

09:04.815 --> 09:07.778
FINE. YOU CAN MAKE ME
MISS DWIGHT'S PARTY,

09:07.778 --> 09:09.920
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE ME
HELP YOU WITH YOURS.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.722
I'M ON STRIKE THIS HALLOWEEN.

09:13.083 --> 09:17.187
THIS PARTY IS DOOMED.

09:17.187 --> 09:20.791
NO, REALLY,
THIS PARTY'S DOOMED.

09:26.196 --> 09:29.700
CARE FOR SOME
"HORROR" D'OEUVRES?

09:33.804 --> 09:39.349
IT'S NOT SCARY IF THEY CAN
SEE YOUR ENTIRE BODY, DAD.

09:39.349 --> 09:41.181
AND WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DRESSED AS ANYWAY?

09:41.181 --> 09:45.015
WE ARE THE SCARIEST
TIME OF DAY:

09:45.015 --> 09:47.888
Both:
MIDNIGHT.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.160
WELL, I'M GLAD MIDNIGHT
MADE IT TO THIS PARTY,

09:50.160 --> 09:53.023
'CAUSE THIS PARTY'S
NOT MAKING IT TO MIDNIGHT.

09:53.023 --> 09:55.595
AVERY, YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO THAT OTHER PARTY,

09:55.595 --> 09:56.897
SO YOU SHOULD JUST
HONOR YOUR COMMITMENT

09:56.897 --> 09:58.729
AND HELP US TURN
THIS PARTY AROUND.

09:58.729 --> 10:00.631
I AM NOT GOING
TO HELP YOU.

10:00.631 --> 10:02.803
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LET ME GO TO DWIGHT'S PARTY

10:02.803 --> 10:05.035
WHILE THERE'S STILL TIME
FOR ME TO MEET UP WITH WES?

10:05.035 --> 10:07.638
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL JUST
SEE WHO CRACKS FIRST,
WON'T WE?

10:07.638 --> 10:08.709
WE WILL.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.145
DID THIS JUST BECOME
A STARING CONTEST?
NO.

10:15.145 --> 10:18.749
THEN WHY DON'T YOU BLINK?
BECAUSE I WANT TO WIN
THE STARING CONTEST.

10:18.749 --> 10:21.952
I'VE GOTTA BLINK!
MY EYES DRY OUT!
IT'S NOT FAIR!

10:24.695 --> 10:27.057
AVERY, I, I GET WHY YOU'RE
MAD AT MOM AND DAD,

10:27.057 --> 10:29.660
BUT YOU'RE KILLING US.
THIS PARTY IS TERRIBLE.

10:29.660 --> 10:31.201
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
AS A STRIP OF BACON?

10:31.201 --> 10:33.303
THIS WAS THE ONLY COSTUME
LEFT AT THE LAST MINUTE

10:33.303 --> 10:34.965
AND I HAD TO RETURN MY
OTHER COSTUME 'CAUSE

10:34.965 --> 10:36.867
SOMEONE'S PAPER
COVERED MY SCISSORS.

10:36.867 --> 10:40.640
SCISSORS CUTS PAPER.
DANG IT!

10:40.640 --> 10:42.773
COME ON, AVERY,
YOU HAVE TO SAVE THIS PARTY.

10:42.773 --> 10:45.415
THE ONLY CUTE GIRL
HERE IS THAT VEGETARIAN
IN THE CORNER

10:45.415 --> 10:48.278
AND I'M DRESSED
AS BREAKFAST MEAT!

10:48.278 --> 10:50.650
PLEASE, SAVE THIS PARTY,
NONE OF THE BOYS

10:50.650 --> 10:53.653
ARE RUNNING AWAY SCREAMING.
OR PEEING THEIR PANTS.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.756
NOT EVEN
A LITTLE FEAR-TINKLE.

10:58.188 --> 11:00.660
AVERY, SAVE THIS PARTY
OR I'LL CURSE YOU!

11:00.660 --> 11:04.434
I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS. I HAVE MADE
A STAND AND I'M STICKING TO IT.

11:04.434 --> 11:05.836
I CURSE YOU!
( spits )

11:07.998 --> 11:09.700
( sighs )

11:09.700 --> 11:10.971
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
TO GET AVERY

11:10.971 --> 11:13.143
BACK IN
THE HALLOWEEN SPIRIT.

11:13.143 --> 11:16.376
HEY, MAYBE IF WE PULL
A SCARY PRANK ON HER.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.709
SHE LOVES THOSE.

11:18.709 --> 11:22.152
WE'LL RIG A TRAP
SO A BUCKET OF FAKE
BLOOD DUMPS ALL OVER HER.

11:22.152 --> 11:24.684
IT'LL SNAP HER RIGHT BACK
INTO THE HALLOWEEN MOOD.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.187
OR SHE'LL JUST BE REALLY MAD
AND COVERED IN FAKE BLOOD.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.159
EITHER WAY,
I'LL BE HAPPY.

11:29.159 --> 11:30.721
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,

11:30.721 --> 11:32.993
I'LL NEED A CHICKEN
AND A CHALICE.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.865
OKAY, YOU'RE STARTING
TO FREAK ME OUT.

11:37.768 --> 11:40.100
Stan: HEY, WHO'S THAT
GOOD LOOKIN' ROBOT?

11:40.100 --> 11:42.402
THERE'S THE SUGAR!

11:44.374 --> 11:46.907
Stan ( in robot voice): WHAT IS
A ROBOT'S FAVORITE DANCE?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.079
THE TWIST.

11:50.781 --> 11:53.483
YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOING
TO SAY THE ROBOT.

11:53.483 --> 11:56.416
WOW, THAT'S
A GREAT COSTUME, STAN.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.448
I CAN'T EVEN TELL
YOU'RE A DOG IN THAT.

11:58.448 --> 12:01.321
I KNOW. NOW I'M GONNA
GO FIND BENNETT AND ELLEN.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.953
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO TALK TO THEM!

12:02.953 --> 12:05.325
THERE ARE THESE QUESTIONS
THAT I'M DYING TO ASK THEM.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.726
WHAT ARE THEY?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.958
WELL, ACTUALLY, THEY'RE--
THEY'RE KIND OF PERSONAL

12:07.958 --> 12:11.061
BETWEEN ME AND THEM.
NOW IF ONLY I COULD SEE

12:11.061 --> 12:12.362
BETTER OUT OF THESE EYE HOLES.

12:12.362 --> 12:14.935
OH, THAT'S MY BAD.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.507
EXCUSE ME, SCARY GUY.
HUMAN COMING THROUGH.

12:17.507 --> 12:20.871
OW, OH, BOY. OKAY.

12:20.871 --> 12:22.742
( grunts ) THERE IT IS.

12:24.474 --> 12:26.246
Stan:
NOW'S MY CHANCE.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.848
UH, HI.

12:27.848 --> 12:32.182
OH, HELLO. WELL, THAT'S
AN INTERESTING COSTUME.

12:32.182 --> 12:34.384
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M ACTUALLY TALKING TO YOU.

12:34.384 --> 12:37.828
OH, YOU'RE A FAN?
YOU'VE READ MY BOOKS?

12:39.229 --> 12:42.532
OKAY, SO YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW ME.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

12:42.532 --> 12:45.836
I'M, UH, JACK.

12:45.836 --> 12:48.999
O'LANTERNBERG.

12:48.999 --> 12:50.470
THAT'S AN INTERESTING NAME.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.503
YES. MY FATHER WAS
A RABBI IN IRELAND.

12:53.503 --> 12:56.376
ANYWAY, THERE'S A QUESTION
I REALLY WANT TO ASK YOU.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.148
IT'S ABOUT YOUR DOG.

12:58.148 --> 13:00.110
I'M THINKING OF GETTING
ONE FOR MY KIDS.

13:00.110 --> 13:04.154
OH. WELL, I GOTTA TELL YA,
HE REALLY BROUGHT OUR
FAMILY TOGETHER.

13:04.154 --> 13:07.517
AW, STOP IT.
HMM.

13:07.517 --> 13:08.819
SO HERE'S MY QUESTION.

13:08.819 --> 13:11.822
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THIS
DOG THAT MADE YOU PICK HIM?

13:11.822 --> 13:14.094
I MEAN, YOU MUST HAVE
HAD A LOT OF CHOICES.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.266
WELL, WHEN I WAS
AT THE SHELTER,

13:16.266 --> 13:19.569
I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT MY KIDS.
CHLOE AND TYLER WERE SIMPLE.

13:19.569 --> 13:23.874
CHLOE LOVES ANIMALS,
AND TYLER'S SIMPLE.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.908
MY REAL CHALLENGE WAS
GOING TO BE FINDING A DOG

13:27.908 --> 13:29.579
THAT AVERY COULD CONNECT WITH.

13:29.579 --> 13:32.112
AND WHEN I LOOKED
INTO STAN'S EYES,

13:32.112 --> 13:34.814
I COULD JUST SEE THIS
INTELLIGENCE BEHIND THEM

13:34.814 --> 13:38.288
THAT THE OTHER DOGS
JUST DIDN'T HAVE.

13:38.288 --> 13:42.022
AND I KNEW AVERY AND STAN
WERE GONNA BE BEST FRIENDS.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.994
( whining )

13:43.994 --> 13:46.496
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I WAS JUST THINKING,

13:46.496 --> 13:49.499
( whines )
WHICH DOG SHOULD I CHOOSE?

13:49.499 --> 13:52.933
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
ENJOY THE PARTY.

13:52.933 --> 13:56.236
AND, UH, GOOD LUCK
ENJOYING THE PARTY.

13:58.538 --> 14:02.112
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

14:02.112 --> 14:05.215
( slow ballad playing )

14:06.616 --> 14:09.179
HEY!

14:09.179 --> 14:11.281
OH, HEY, STAN.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.085
BACON KNOWS MY NAME!

14:18.088 --> 14:19.089
HEY, GIRLS.

14:19.089 --> 14:20.560
OH, HI, MRS. JENNINGS.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.963
HAVE YOU SEEN AVERY?
OH, I THINK SHE'S
ON THE PATIO.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.195
HEY, LINDSAY, WEREN'T
YOU THE MAD HATTER LAST YEAR?

14:25.195 --> 14:26.496
WELL, YEAH,
IT'S THE ONE OUTFIT THAT GOES

14:26.496 --> 14:28.568
WITH MY FAVORITE HAT.
( chuckles )

14:28.568 --> 14:29.869
AND WHAT ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE, MAX?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.371
I'M A TWENTY-EIGHT-
YEAR-OLD BARISTA

14:31.371 --> 14:33.603
WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE.
SCARY, HUH?

14:35.445 --> 14:37.477
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS DOING HERE?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.579
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
AT DWIGHT CHANDLER'S PARTY,

14:39.579 --> 14:41.912
SPYING ON WES AND TELLING ME
EVERYTHING HE DOES, SAYS,

14:41.912 --> 14:44.254
THINKS, AND LIKES WITHOUT
ACTUALLY TALKING TO HIM,

14:44.254 --> 14:46.616
BECAUSE HE'S MINE.

14:46.616 --> 14:47.958
WELL, WE HAD A BETTER IDEA.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.619
WE SPENT THE WHOLE TIME
AT DWIGHT'S PARTY

14:49.619 --> 14:51.561
SAYING HOW AWESOME
THIS PARTY IS.

14:51.561 --> 14:54.664
THEN WE STARTED A RUMOR SOMEONE
FARTED IN DWIGHT'S PUNCH BOWL.

14:54.664 --> 14:57.097
THEN SOMEONE FARTED
IN DWIGHT'S PUNCH BOWL.

15:00.130 --> 15:03.073
WHO'S YOUR BEST FRIEND?

15:03.073 --> 15:05.535
THE POINT IS,
WES BAILED ON DWIGHT'S.
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

15:05.535 --> 15:08.538
WAIT, WES IS COMING HERE?
TO THIS PARTY?

15:08.538 --> 15:10.280
WELL, YEAH,
WE SAID IT WAS GREAT.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.483
( gasps )
WOO!

15:13.483 --> 15:16.446
I THINK WE MAY
HAVE OVERSOLD IT.

15:16.446 --> 15:18.518
WELL, AVERY, I HOPE
YOU'RE HAPPY.
THE PARTY'S OVER.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.190
NO!
NO, IT IS NOT.

15:20.190 --> 15:23.423
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS
THE BEST HALLOWEEN PARTY EVER.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.455
BUT THIS PARTY IS DEAD.

15:25.455 --> 15:29.559
NO. IT'S ALIVE.
IT'S ALIVE!

15:29.559 --> 15:31.331
( roaring sound )

15:33.433 --> 15:35.335
I WAS JUST FLICKING
THE LIGHTS SO EVERYONE

15:35.335 --> 15:38.168
KNOWS IT'S TIME
TO GO HOME!

15:38.168 --> 15:40.340
AND I DROPPED
THIS TRASH CAN LID.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.711
( lid bangs )

15:46.516 --> 15:50.450
QUICKLY, PEOPLE, WE'VE GOT
TO TURN THIS PARTY AROUND!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.621
TYLER, GET OUT OF THAT COSTUME.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.683
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME TWICE!

15:53.683 --> 15:57.988
BACON, BACON, BACON, BACON,
BACON, BACON, BACON, BACON...

15:57.988 --> 16:00.560
AVERY, WE ARE VERY IMPRESSED
BY YOUR CHANGE OF HEART.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.392
WISH IT WOULD HAVE
COME A LITTLE SOONER.

16:02.392 --> 16:05.335
WELL, I REALIZED
I HAD MADE A COMMITMENT
AND I HAD TO HONOR IT.

16:05.335 --> 16:07.067
THAT BOY IS COMING
OVER HERE, ISN'T HE?

16:07.067 --> 16:08.668
YES, HE IS.
SO SNAP TO!

16:10.240 --> 16:11.641
OOH, WAIT.

16:13.403 --> 16:14.504
WHA-- AVERY!

16:14.504 --> 16:16.476
WH-- HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.678
NO ONE GETS "MIDNIGHT."
YOU'RE DOMINOS.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.151
NOW GET TO WORK.

16:21.151 --> 16:24.354
DOMINO?
MORE LIKE DOMI-YES.

16:24.354 --> 16:25.685
THAT WAS NOT A GOOD ONE,
ELLEN.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.422
HI. UH, ELLEN,
RIGHT?

16:32.422 --> 16:34.394
YEAH. WHO IS THAT
UNDER THERE?

16:34.394 --> 16:37.127
MY NAME'S
JACK O'LANTERNBERG.

16:37.127 --> 16:40.670
MY FATHER WAS
A LEPRECHAUN IN ISRAEL.

16:40.670 --> 16:43.203
I WAS TALKING TO
YOUR HUSBAND EARLIER
ABOUT YOUR DOG.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.506
OH, STAN DIDN'T GET IN,
DID HE? I TOLD THE KIDS
TO KEEP HIM OUTSIDE.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.007
NO, HE HASN'T
BOTHERED ME AT ALL.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.081
ACTUALLY, HE SEEMS
VERY SWEET AND LOVABLE.

16:51.081 --> 16:54.544
AND HANDSOME.
AND REALLY SMART.

16:54.544 --> 16:56.516
I'VE SEEN HIM
EAT A PINE CONE.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.319
HE'S NOT THAT SMART.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.251
SO THERE'S SOMETHING
I REALLY WANT TO KNOW.

17:01.251 --> 17:03.253
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE DOGS?

17:03.253 --> 17:05.295
WHY DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW THAT?

17:05.295 --> 17:08.558
I'M A ROBOT.
I THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE.

17:08.558 --> 17:10.160
IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T LIKE DOGS,

17:10.160 --> 17:12.562
IT'S JUST THAT, UM,
SOMETHING HAPPENED ONCE.

17:12.562 --> 17:14.304
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

17:14.304 --> 17:15.565
WELL, I CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT TO PRY IF YOU--

17:15.565 --> 17:18.408
WHEN I WAS EIGHT,
I WAS A LONELY GIRL.

17:18.408 --> 17:20.070
I DIDN'T GET ALONG
WITH MY SISTER,

17:20.070 --> 17:21.671
MY PARENTS WEREN'T
AROUND THAT MUCH,

17:21.671 --> 17:24.074
AND I HAD NO FRIENDS.

17:24.074 --> 17:27.077
AND THEN ONE DAY, THIS DOG
FOLLOWED ME HOME FROM SCHOOL.

17:27.077 --> 17:30.750
I NAMED HIM RASCAL
AND HE BECAME MY BEST FRIEND.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.423
THE ONLY ONE
I COULD TALK TO.

17:33.423 --> 17:35.225
WHEN I'D SIT ON THE COUCH,
HE'D PUT HIS HEAD ON MY LAP

17:35.225 --> 17:38.558
AND SUDDENLY I DIDN'T
FEEL ALONE.

17:38.558 --> 17:45.765
AND THEN ONE DAY, HE, HE JUST
RAN AWAY AND I WAS ALONE AGAIN.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.597
I'VE NEVER LIKED DOGS
SINCE THEN.

17:47.597 --> 17:51.471
OH, MY GOSH, I, I HAD NO IDEA.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.543
WELL, HOW WOULD YOU?
( chuckles )

17:53.543 --> 17:57.177
YOU KNOW, NOT ALL DOGS
ARE THE SAME.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.579
I BET IF YOU GAVE
YOUR DOG A CHANCE,

17:59.579 --> 18:01.411
HE JUST MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.

18:01.411 --> 18:02.752
THE ONLY TIME HE EVER
SURPRISED ME WAS WHEN

18:02.752 --> 18:06.686
THE WHOLE PINE
CONE CAME OUT.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.689
IT SURPRISED ME, TOO.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.691
( dance music playing )

18:14.524 --> 18:17.597
AVERY, THIS PLACE LOOKS AMAZING!
YOU LOOK AMAZING!

18:17.597 --> 18:19.399
HOW DID YOU DO IT
ALL SO QUICKLY?

18:19.399 --> 18:20.670
THE REAL QUESTION IS,

18:20.670 --> 18:23.273
HOW DID YOU DO WHAT
YOU DID WITH SO MUCH TIME?

18:24.704 --> 18:27.177
( screaming )

18:28.838 --> 18:32.782
THAT'S RIGHT, BOYS. RUN.
( chuckles menacingly )

18:32.782 --> 18:36.346
WATCH THE FEAR-TINKLE.

18:36.346 --> 18:38.688
PRETTY SIX-Y, HUH?

18:40.550 --> 18:42.352
OOPS, I MISCOUNTED.

18:42.352 --> 18:44.454
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
WITH A FIVE JOKE.

18:46.156 --> 18:47.797
( screaming )

18:47.797 --> 18:49.199
( laughing )

18:49.199 --> 18:50.600
IS HE COMING?
WES AND HIS FRIENDS

18:50.600 --> 18:53.403
ARE WALKING UP THE DRIVEWAY.
THEY'LL BE HERE ANY SECOND.

18:53.403 --> 18:55.535
( giggles ) WELL,
I'M READY FOR THEM.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.806
OOH, WAIT, I'M GONNA
MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.713
WOW, THIS PLACE LOOKS COOL.

19:03.713 --> 19:05.475
HEY, WHOSE PARTY
IS THIS AGAIN?

19:06.816 --> 19:09.249
♪♪

19:13.152 --> 19:17.156
OH, WHAT'S THIS DOING HERE?
THIS DOESN'T LOOK SAFE.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.730
OH, NO! WE FORGOT
TO TAKE DOWN OUR
FAKE BLOOD PRANK!

19:36.746 --> 19:41.711
NO!

19:54.324 --> 19:57.627
WHOA!
THAT WAS AN AWESOME STUNT!

19:57.627 --> 19:58.598
YOU LOOK GREAT!

19:58.598 --> 19:59.869
( laughs )

19:59.869 --> 20:03.433
THANKS!
I LOVE HALLOWEEN.

20:03.433 --> 20:05.275
SO DO I.

20:06.576 --> 20:09.409
YOU KNOW, UM, I'M REALLY
GLAD YOU'RE AT MY PARTY.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.810
YEAH, ME, TOO.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.483
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE PRETTY COOL.

20:15.645 --> 20:19.349
LOOK, THEY'RE TALKING.
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

20:19.349 --> 20:21.591
I DON'T WANT TO ALARM
YOU OR ANYTHING,

20:21.591 --> 20:24.894
BUT I THINK THE PUNCH BOWL
FARTER IS AT YOUR PARTY.

20:28.358 --> 20:30.560
AVERY, I-- I AM SO SORRY!
WE HAD THIS PRANK SET UP

20:30.560 --> 20:31.661
AND THEN I FORGOT--

20:31.661 --> 20:35.305
AND IT WORKED OUT PERFECTLY,
JUST LIKE WE PLANNED.

20:35.305 --> 20:36.936
NOW RUN ALONG.
OH.

20:36.936 --> 20:40.440
( yelling )
WHOA!

20:40.440 --> 20:43.973
WE'RE DOMINOS!
HOW DID NONE OF US
SEE THIS COMING?

20:43.973 --> 20:45.875
I DID.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.919
Stan: SO, AVERY MADE
A CONNECTION WITH WES

20:49.919 --> 20:52.322
AND GOT SOMETHING
SHE ALWAYS WANTED.

20:52.322 --> 20:54.784
AND I GOT SOMETHING I ALWAYS
WANTED FROM BENNETT AND ELLEN.

20:54.784 --> 20:57.627
IT MEANT MORE TO ME
THAN I CAN SAY.

20:57.627 --> 20:59.959
I CAN'T WAIT TILL I GET
TO TALK TO THEM NEXT YEAR.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.763
I ALREADY KNOW WHAT I'M GOING
AS: THE PUNCH BOWL FARTER.

21:08.938 --> 21:12.001
( giggling )
SO THEN WES SAID,
"YOU'RE PRETTY COOL."

21:12.001 --> 21:13.803
( cheering )

21:13.803 --> 21:15.605
HE SAID TO ME,
"IS THIS HUMMUS?"

21:15.605 --> 21:17.647
BUT HE'S STILL YOURS.
I'M NOT GONNA SWOOP IN.

21:21.611 --> 21:24.384
HEY, WHO LET YOU BACK IN?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.886
Stan: DON'T WORRY.
I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU.

21:26.886 --> 21:31.691
AH, COME ON, STAN. BACK OUTSIDE
UNTIL WE'RE DONE CLEANING UP.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.023
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
HE'S FINE.

21:34.023 --> 21:35.665
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I WAS TALKING TO

21:35.665 --> 21:37.597
THE NICEST GUY
TONIGHT ABOUT STAN.

21:37.597 --> 21:40.330
REALLY? SO WAS I.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.031
LOOK, HE'S STILL HERE.
LET'S GO SAY HI.

21:42.031 --> 21:44.604
HEY, JACK. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE STILL HERE.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.005
HOW'S IT GOING?

21:46.005 --> 21:49.879
GREAT. IT WAS REALLY NICE
TALKING TO YOU GUYS TONIGHT.

21:49.879 --> 21:52.582
YEAH.

21:52.582 --> 21:55.845
OH, NO!
JACK, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

21:55.845 --> 21:57.687
( screaming )

21:57.687 --> 22:00.390
WHERE ARE THOSE GHOST HUNTERS
WHEN YOU NEED THEM?
