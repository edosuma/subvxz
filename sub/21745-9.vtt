WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.270
I don't get
what your problem is.

00:02.303 --> 00:03.804
Mom, you're not serious,
are you?

00:03.837 --> 00:06.174
Mom, you still have to
take me to Chloe's house
on Saturday.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.875
Mom, this is
child abandonment.

00:07.908 --> 00:10.478
We're like orphans now!
(door slams)

00:13.147 --> 00:16.784
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.722
(snoring)

00:27.061 --> 00:29.197
(distant siren wailing)

00:29.230 --> 00:31.599
(dog barking in distance)

00:38.038 --> 00:40.741
(snoring continues)

00:41.875 --> 00:44.545
Oh...

00:44.578 --> 00:47.848
Morning, Jimmy.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.251
I know you're asleep,

00:50.284 --> 00:53.454
but I just wanted to say
our talk last night really...

00:53.487 --> 00:54.822
(Jimmy snoring)

00:54.855 --> 01:00.628
It really was just...
so unexpected.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.430
And I know we didn't
say anything,

01:02.463 --> 01:05.266
-but this morning I'm feeling...
-(snoring loudly)

01:05.299 --> 01:06.967
Okay! Never mind.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.305
*

01:13.341 --> 01:17.044
LINDSAY: What are you
smiling about over there,

01:17.077 --> 01:19.147
like some sort of gooneybird?

01:19.180 --> 01:22.650
Jimmy and I fell asleep
on the phone last night.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.486
Awesome. So, do you think we'll
be in the same homeroom

01:25.519 --> 01:27.321
together next year?

01:27.355 --> 01:31.058
I know.
It was just really... nice.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.328
Does that mean you're back
riding that yogurt tube?

01:34.362 --> 01:35.563
I don't know.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.498
We'll see, I guess.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.333
Well, what are you going
to do about it?

01:39.367 --> 01:41.769
I'm not really a "do something
about stuff" kind of person.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.971
I'm more of a "it's too late
to buy a wedding gift,

01:44.004 --> 01:45.973
so I'll just stop being friends
with them" kind of person.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.176
Cool. Well, that story
finished dumb.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.144
Anyway.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.413
It all ends today, Gretch.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.716
Becca ruined my life,
and she needs to know

01:55.749 --> 01:57.218
how much damage she's caused me.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.820
And then I'm gonna punch
that stupid bitch

01:59.853 --> 02:01.855
in her stupid bitch face.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.424
Ooh, I should probably
take these off.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.925
Hooker fights dirty.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.994
GRETCHEN:
Okay, let me just press record.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.197
Before you hit her,
I'm gonna yell, "Worldstar."

02:09.230 --> 02:10.631
Oh, wait. Is it after?

02:10.664 --> 02:12.065
We'll shoot it both ways.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.805
Lindsay!

02:17.838 --> 02:19.173
Mom?

02:24.178 --> 02:26.180
Worldstar!

02:29.283 --> 02:31.051
*

02:34.087 --> 02:37.258
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:37.291 --> 02:40.328
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:40.361 --> 02:41.762
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.970
PARROT (on TV): Rest in peace,
Penny the Penguin.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.739
I never thought you'd jump.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.709
PARROT 2: She finally flew.
If only for one or two seconds.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.779
Dude, are you sure Birds
is for kids?

02:58.812 --> 03:00.781
That's the second suicide

03:00.814 --> 03:03.217
and they haven't even
left the island yet.

03:03.251 --> 03:06.153
When Doug assigned us to parody
this movie, I don't think

03:06.186 --> 03:08.055
-he realized how depressing
it is. -(door closes)

03:08.088 --> 03:11.725
Well, I have some
highly exciting news.

03:11.759 --> 03:15.996
The Width of a Peach
is a bestseller!

03:16.029 --> 03:20.167
It is number seven
on Amazon's Erotica list,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.403
number five on Amazon's Erotica

03:22.436 --> 03:25.172
subcategory
Historical Romance list,

03:25.205 --> 03:29.076
and number one on Amazon's
Erotica subcategory

03:29.109 --> 03:31.479
Historical Romance
subcategories: World War II,

03:31.512 --> 03:33.614
UK and Family Fun.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.183
That is so great!

03:36.216 --> 03:39.287
I really hope you allow yourself
to enjoy this special time.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.423
Oh, Jimmy.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.891
This is Max.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.626
We're co-writers
at Doug Loves Sketches.

03:45.659 --> 03:49.463
-Bro, you missed a sick party
here last night. -(laughs)

03:49.497 --> 03:51.765
Yeah, I-I wouldn't
call it a party.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.835
It was more like a meeting.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.237
With balloons.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.772
Oh, stop.
I know all about it.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.275
I talked to Gretchen
on the phone last night.

04:01.309 --> 04:05.045
It was just like old times.
Easy. Natural.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.616
We caught up, we joked about
the many hilarious tragic ends

04:08.649 --> 04:10.217
which may have befallen Killian.

04:10.250 --> 04:15.356
And then, we fell asleep
on the phone together.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.325
Like lovers.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.659
I don't want to
get ahead of myself,

04:18.692 --> 04:20.861
Edgar and other person, but...

04:20.894 --> 04:23.464
I think the door is opening.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.334
You have to tell him.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.435
I don't want to tell him.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.136
-Bro.
-Bro.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.304
-Bro?
-Bro.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.639
-Bro.
-Bro!

04:31.672 --> 04:32.973
Tell me what?

04:34.875 --> 04:37.778
Gretchen brought Boone
to the party last night.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.482
Oh.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.785
And his daughter Olivia.
So cute.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.688
Wise, you know?
How some kids just look wise?

04:47.721 --> 04:51.492
Like, there's something in
their eyes that lets you know

04:51.525 --> 04:53.327
they get it, man.

04:53.361 --> 04:56.330
Like, you can just rap to them,
like people, you know?

04:56.364 --> 04:58.866
What?

04:58.899 --> 05:01.769
Hey, where's your friend?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.271
So, when my agent called
about the role

05:04.304 --> 05:07.908
on ABC's Man in the Middle,
I was so excited.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.310
You know,
I'm playing a grandmother,

05:10.344 --> 05:12.279
which is a wink-wink
to the audience, of course,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.815
because as if
that were possible.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.884
(laughing)

05:16.917 --> 05:18.852
Oh. Hello, Lindsay.

05:18.886 --> 05:22.322
Did your apartment get
taken over by pigeons again?

05:22.356 --> 05:23.991
Thanks for telling me
Mom was coming.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.060
Of course she would visit
Tallulah, my baby,

05:27.094 --> 05:29.530
-that I actually had.
-(Tallulah cries)

05:29.563 --> 05:31.131
VERNON: Hey, can someone
take her for a little while?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.400
I'm doing an all-night shift

05:32.433 --> 05:34.334
and I'm running on fumes.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.371
I got these pills they use
to wake people up from comas,

05:37.405 --> 05:39.106
but now I can hear my blinks.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.909
Hey! I had her, you watch her.
That was the deal.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.413
Besides, my mommy's visiting me.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.647
Oh, you know, that reminds me...

05:46.680 --> 05:51.452
Vernon, I received a welcome bag
from the show,

05:51.485 --> 05:53.854
and I thought you might
want this.

05:53.887 --> 05:57.090
A real-life Bluetooth speaker!
No way!

05:57.124 --> 05:58.559
So sick!

05:58.592 --> 06:01.128
Hope you like Sublime.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.631
Mommy, I'm so happy you're here.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.266
Guess what I'm doing now.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.335
-I... -Sometimes
when I just look around

06:08.368 --> 06:09.770
at the life I've made,

06:09.803 --> 06:13.841
my husband, my baby,
my beautiful house...

06:13.874 --> 06:16.076
Your total estimated worth
of zero dollars.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.245
Your associate's degree
in fitness.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.581
VERNON: (whoops) This kid
just dropped a major dook.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.616
I am talking a post
Homestyle Buffet widowmaker.

06:22.650 --> 06:27.054
-Oh. -Oh, my...
-Mom, I'm a stylist now.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.589
I read a really long book.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.990
I bought a new underwear.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.191
I have a gay friend.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.694
-I tricked a dog!
-Girls!

06:33.727 --> 06:37.865
Girls, you don't have to compete
for my attention.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.668
I'm never gonna tell you
which one I like better.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.302
(all laughing)

06:42.335 --> 06:46.139
Oh, you haven't seen
the nursery yet.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.043
I am your favorite,
though, right?

06:52.980 --> 06:54.515
Let's just go.

06:54.548 --> 06:58.085
You can't just let her win.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.220
This is important to you.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.523
Plus I didn't get
my Worldstar video.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.892
You're doing this.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.894
Thanks, Gretch.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.929
-(phone rings) -You've always
been such a good...

07:08.962 --> 07:12.165
Hey! What's up?

07:12.199 --> 07:15.936
Ooh. Really?
(giggles)

07:15.969 --> 07:17.404
Yeah.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.839
Camping sounds fun.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.542
Um, let me just
check my schedule.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.777
Okay. Bye.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.718
(sighs)

07:31.752 --> 07:33.487
Faye's the best, isn't she?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.923
Did you check out that dope
speaker she gaffled for me?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.959
Seriously,
how effing cool is she?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.460
Calm down. You're sweating.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.995
Sorry.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.331
I've had a major bone
for Faye Cottumaccio

07:44.364 --> 07:45.999
since her old Cinemax movies.

07:46.033 --> 07:49.937
Then I discovered
Bec has these old home vids.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.204
Faye looks so hot in them.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.506
You want to check one out?

07:56.276 --> 07:59.179
What's up? I'm getting kind of
de-cranked by your bummer vibes.

07:59.212 --> 08:05.352
Apparently Olivia is begging
for me to go camping with them.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.254
I told Boone
we could go down a road.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.990
And now we are, and I'm just not
sure it's the right move for me.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.392
Duck him. When I get a code blue
and I don't want to go,

08:12.425 --> 08:14.494
I just fake diarrhea
and hide in the morgue.

08:14.528 --> 08:18.398
Or... I could let the universe
decide for me,

08:18.431 --> 08:20.467
that way nothing's
ever my fault?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.703
Look, it sucks,
but more often than not,

08:22.736 --> 08:25.405
the key to interpersonal
bullroar is simple:

08:25.438 --> 08:27.975
you need to communicate
with the other dingus.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.543
(sighs)
You're right.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.879
I'm just gonna talk to Boone
face-to-face and tell him

08:31.912 --> 08:33.681
I'm not ready for this.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.816
My titty-sucking therapist
told me

08:35.849 --> 08:37.417
I should be honest
with my feelings.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.720
Yes, this like
how I keep telling everyone

08:39.753 --> 08:43.056
how dangerously exhausted I am,
so that eventually someone...

08:43.090 --> 08:44.457
Yeah, I'm just gonna text him.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.201
PARROT: I told you, I don't want
to talk about Penny

08:54.234 --> 08:55.803
the Penguin anymore-- she went
to the aviary in the sky

08:55.836 --> 08:58.305
I just want
to get this straight.

08:58.338 --> 09:01.274
Gretchen has the nerve
to bring that geriatric

09:01.308 --> 09:06.246
and his filthy spawn into my
home and then call me to chat?!

09:06.279 --> 09:07.648
Like lovers?

09:07.681 --> 09:09.216
Fam, Fam, what you need to do

09:09.249 --> 09:11.051
is get your mind off this girl

09:11.084 --> 09:13.520
and just get out there
and bang someone, Fam.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.725
Yeah, maybe that works for
a bro-y man-child like yourself,

09:17.758 --> 09:20.127
but I am a novelist,

09:20.160 --> 09:21.962
and an empath,

09:21.995 --> 09:24.297
thus, have
a heightened sensitivity

09:24.331 --> 09:25.966
to the pain of others.

09:25.999 --> 09:29.169
If I were to use someone
and make them feel bad,

09:29.202 --> 09:32.039
that, in turn,
would make me feel bad.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.374
Why would you make her feel bad?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.809
Two people can want something

09:35.843 --> 09:37.144
from each other,
and both get it,

09:37.177 --> 09:39.880
-and part ways happy.
-(sputters)

09:39.913 --> 09:42.082
That's ridiculous.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.053
Happiness is a finite commodity.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.988
You have to steal it
from people.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.190
And I'm just...
I'm not the kind of person

09:50.223 --> 09:51.759
who would mistreat someone
like that.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.294
Edgar! Can you blow your nose
or something?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.563
There's a faint whistle
every time you breathe.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.666
A faint whistle every time
I breathe?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.600
Listen, find a girl
who's down and out,

10:00.634 --> 10:04.137
take her for a fancy meal and a
little compelling conversation,

10:04.171 --> 10:06.707
and then drop some ropes
on her face.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.677
You get laid, she learns
what truffle fries are.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.411
Well...

10:11.444 --> 10:14.381
there is someone I know
who fits that bill.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.483
-Katherine.
-Mm.

10:16.516 --> 10:19.286
She was the saddest girl
in Manchester.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.655
She moved to L.A.
only to work as a waitress

10:21.689 --> 10:22.990
at The Fox and Hounds.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.125
Bro, you take her to République,

10:25.158 --> 10:28.996
my boy Eli will hook you up
with that dank sparkling rosé.

10:29.029 --> 10:33.366
Or better yet,
invite her here and wow her

10:33.400 --> 10:35.602
with my architecturally
significant house,

10:35.635 --> 10:37.838
that also contains-- what?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.173
A bed!

10:40.207 --> 10:42.609
For dropping
the aforementioned ropes.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.812
Great! So, when next
I come upstairs,

10:44.845 --> 10:47.447
-you two will be gone.
-Ah, but we have to finish

10:47.480 --> 10:49.649
this movie for work.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.519
I don't care.
Go to... his.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.955
Ooh, can't. I ordered
a bunch of oysters off Amazon

10:54.988 --> 10:57.891
and forget them
in my mud room, so...

10:57.925 --> 10:59.893
Well, then go...
go watch at Lindsay's.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.629
(gasps) She does have tons
of boxed mac and cheese.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.264
Macki and cheesy! Yum town!

11:04.297 --> 11:06.066
-Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.
-(laughs)

11:06.099 --> 11:09.036
Does anyone actually
find that endearing?

11:09.069 --> 11:10.904
I cannot imagine so.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.205
No.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.709
PARROT: After Penny died,
things were never

11:15.743 --> 11:17.444
the same between me and Alan.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.980
I always said I'd call him
tomorrow-- who knew that one day

11:20.013 --> 11:22.850
tomorrow would be the day
he got sucked into a jet engine?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.752
-(several sobbing on TV)
-(sighs heavily)

11:24.785 --> 11:27.755
Well, it's gonna be tough
to make this one into a ride.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.156
(knocking at door)

11:29.189 --> 11:30.690
Yes! I'm starving.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.560
Edgar?

11:33.593 --> 11:35.195
-R...
-Yeah, buddy!

11:35.228 --> 11:37.697
Comida Argentina, por favor.
Mi mas gusta.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.332
Oh, thanks a lot.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.970
(mumbles)

11:43.003 --> 11:44.805
It's nice to see you, Ricky.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.574
What was that about?
Pretending you don't know me?

11:47.607 --> 11:49.476
I helped you bury that camel.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.012
Oh, i-it's just that I...
I don't tell everyone right off

11:52.045 --> 11:53.446
about my combat experience.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.248
They-they see you
in a certain way.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.617
-Oh, yeah. -Not that I wouldn't.
He's a really cool guy.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.487
No, no, no, I get it.
Mm, you don't want him

12:00.520 --> 12:02.255
to see you
like some messed-up vet.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.456
Oh...

12:03.490 --> 12:04.825
Like me.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.093
No.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.729
No, Ricky, I...

12:09.763 --> 12:11.531
(sighs)

12:12.766 --> 12:14.835
-Mmm...!
-Delivery foul.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.704
Dude forgot your chimichurri
for your steak.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.973
Aw, no, it's okay.
I don't need it.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.009
Bro, it's his job, okay?
I got this.

12:23.877 --> 12:27.480
(soft, romantic music playing)

12:27.514 --> 12:29.682
(knocking at door)

12:30.951 --> 12:32.352
Katherine.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.322
Wow. You look
shockingly presentable.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.958
Um, thanks. Good to see you.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.659
Please, come in.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.361
*

12:41.394 --> 12:42.762
KATHERINE:
Oh.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.665
I know what you're going to ask.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.836
Who designed
this breathtaking home?

12:48.869 --> 12:52.039
It's a Schindler, actually.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.740
It's very quaint.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.176
You know,
I hesitated to call you,

12:56.209 --> 12:58.979
but as I was recently reminded,

12:59.012 --> 13:01.748
there is nothing wrong with
two people going into something

13:01.781 --> 13:04.952
eyes wide open, each wanting
to get something out of it.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.287
-Okay.
-Even if one person

13:07.320 --> 13:10.023
demonstrably has far less
to offer than the other.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.658
-That makes sense.
-I've prepared

13:11.691 --> 13:15.162
some of my favorite
hors d'oeuvres for us.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.830
This here...

13:16.864 --> 13:18.398
duck pâté.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.333
Don't ask what it is;
just enjoy it.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.103
-(chuckles) -Are you thirsty?
Would you like a drink?

13:23.136 --> 13:27.774
I'd like you to try
a very special scotch.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.278
It's called Laga-vul-in.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.781
16, as in
that is how old this is.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.816
Sorry, I just can't do
Lagavulin anymore.

13:36.850 --> 13:40.187
Do you have any Japanese
single malts? Like Hibiki 21?

13:40.220 --> 13:42.555
Kendrick Lamar introduced me
to it when I was doing

13:42.589 --> 13:44.324
the deal for his line
of bulletproof hats.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.027
Wait. (snickers)
Hold on. What's happening?

13:47.060 --> 13:50.097
I thought... I thought you
worked at The Fox and Hounds.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.731
Uh, when I was 22.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.833
But you know I'm
an entertainment lawyer now?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.802
Come on, Jimmy.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.537
You can tell me.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.439
Whose house is this?

13:59.472 --> 14:03.110
-This is my home.
-Okay. How much do you need?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.946
You're not the first person from
home to call me out of the blue

14:05.979 --> 14:07.380
and hit me up for money.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.016
No, I...

14:09.049 --> 14:11.952
I don't need money.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.754
I'm a...
I'm a bestselling novelist.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.456
You don't know?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.825
Well, then I'm not that much
higher status than you.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.128
How are you
higher status than me?!

14:21.161 --> 14:23.563
(laughs):
Oh!

14:23.596 --> 14:26.866
Jimmy, you chav!

14:26.900 --> 14:28.168
(laughing)

14:30.203 --> 14:33.406
Hey. What was that name
we used to call you back home?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.976
Oh, oh, I remember--
Mouse Boy and Jizz Magnet.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.378
What was the other one?

14:38.411 --> 14:39.846
Shitty Jimmy.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.249
(laughing):
That was it. Shitty Jimmy!

14:42.282 --> 14:43.850
(gasps)
Oh, my God,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.418
I can still remember the song.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.187
* Shitty Jimmy

14:47.220 --> 14:48.788
* Look at Shitty Jimmy

14:48.821 --> 14:51.491
* Shitty Jimmy
with his little shitty... *

14:51.524 --> 14:53.060
Wha...?
* With his little shitty

14:53.093 --> 14:54.594
* Little, li...
What was it? Come on.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.196
Come on, what was it? Come on.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.198
* With his little shitty face.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.934
Yes! * With his
little shitty face. *

15:00.968 --> 15:04.137
Ha! Shitty Jimmy!

15:04.171 --> 15:06.339
* Shitty Jimmy with his
little shitty face, whoo! *

15:10.978 --> 15:13.780
Okay, I texted him.
"Hey. I'm just not sure

15:13.813 --> 15:16.416
I'm ready for camping.
Hope that's okay."

15:16.449 --> 15:19.386
Look at you--
telling someone what you need.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.021
(electronic chiming)

15:23.123 --> 15:25.092
Yeah, that'd be fine.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.727
BECCA (laughs): And I was like,
"Sorry you got triggered

15:27.760 --> 15:31.164
Snowflakes.
Go back to your 'safe space.'"

15:31.198 --> 15:32.732
Look, Mommy.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.802
An important Los Angeles
magazine did a piece

15:35.835 --> 15:38.171
on my boss, Priscilla, and you
could see me in the background

15:38.205 --> 15:39.472
with some work friends.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.208
(laughs)
"Friends"?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.610
That's why not of them showed up
at your divorce party.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.944
FAYE:
Well, that's rude.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.113
I've been hundreds of parties

15:46.146 --> 15:47.314
for people I don't like.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.681
Bob Baliban. Heather Locklear.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.984
-(sighs): Ooh.
-Stevie Wonder.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.252
He can see, you know.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.686
FAYE:
Okay. I have to go

15:53.720 --> 15:55.655
-get ready for Piloxing.
-Oh!

15:55.688 --> 15:57.490
(laughs)

15:57.524 --> 16:01.228
Listen, you
backstabbing suck-butt,

16:01.261 --> 16:03.663
my entire life
you have been nothing

16:03.696 --> 16:07.700
but a source of underminery
and hurtful, bitchy faces.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.569
-Oh...
-I am not a real person,

16:09.602 --> 16:10.837
and it's all your fault.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.239
So, Becca,

16:12.272 --> 16:14.074
my only sister...

16:14.107 --> 16:16.376
we are officially through.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.012
You're... seriously
gonna stand there,

16:19.046 --> 16:23.216
probably softly farting
as usual, and blame me

16:23.250 --> 16:25.585
for your life being
an actual 9/11?

16:25.618 --> 16:28.721
I had the same challenges
growing up, and look at me.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.224
I'm living in a real house
with real friends

16:31.258 --> 16:33.360
who aren't
disgusting monsters...

16:33.393 --> 16:34.894
Hey!

16:34.927 --> 16:36.663
...and I'm married
to a successful doctor.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.998
Blame me for your life?
Uh-uh.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.767
Sorry, peaches.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.602
You can try and blame
other people,

16:42.635 --> 16:46.673
but, like the actual 9/11,
you did it to yourself.

16:46.706 --> 16:47.774
(gasps)

16:50.143 --> 16:51.211
Ow!

16:51.244 --> 16:52.279
(grunts)

16:52.312 --> 16:54.381
Oh, you want a titty twist?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.548
I'll show you a titty twist!

16:55.582 --> 16:56.583
Ow!

16:58.618 --> 17:00.620
-You don't want none of this!
-I'm the titty twist champion!

17:00.653 --> 17:02.522
Bitch, I will spray your milk
all over this goddamn room!

17:02.555 --> 17:04.091
Give me a tit,
and I'll twist it raw!

17:04.124 --> 17:05.925
-It's gonna be like a dairy.
-FAYE: Girls.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.628
-(shouting continues)
-Girls!

17:08.661 --> 17:10.897
Shit, shit, shit!
Don't stop yet!

17:10.930 --> 17:12.399
FAYE (over speaker):
Well, Officer, if you're gonna

17:12.432 --> 17:15.068
search the place,
I suggest you start

17:15.102 --> 17:16.336
under my sweater.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.037
-(sultry music playing)
-(Faye laughing)

17:18.071 --> 17:20.073
Am I talking?

17:20.107 --> 17:23.110
Vernon!

17:23.143 --> 17:24.577
Oh, shit!

17:24.611 --> 17:27.647
Vernon, your dumb speaker is

17:27.680 --> 17:29.416
blasting filth
all over the house!

17:29.449 --> 17:31.118
-Turn that off!
-(Faye moaning over video)

17:31.151 --> 17:32.119
Is that...

17:32.152 --> 17:34.020
Mommy?!

17:34.053 --> 17:35.021
G-Get out of here!

17:35.054 --> 17:36.756
Jesus, I'm busy! I'm...

17:36.789 --> 17:39.292
(gasps) Oh, man, them boobies.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.128
(moaning loudly)

17:41.161 --> 17:43.196
(Lindsay laughing)

17:45.598 --> 17:47.267
(grunts, groans)

17:47.300 --> 17:49.136
(Lindsay laughing)

17:49.169 --> 17:50.803
Worldstar!

17:50.837 --> 17:53.373
Okay. I'm off to Equinox.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.844
I just wanted Mom to think
I had everything figured out.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.849
I didn't want her to know
that we have no money!

18:02.882 --> 18:06.686
And that I'm married to
a talking penis in a clown wig!

18:08.921 --> 18:10.022
(sobbing)

18:14.361 --> 18:17.330
My life is shit.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.065
(sobbing)

18:19.098 --> 18:21.000
Why do you think
I go through a c...

18:21.033 --> 18:23.102
a case of Kendall-Jackson
a week?

18:23.136 --> 18:24.771
(sniffles)

18:24.804 --> 18:26.806
(sobbing)

18:35.415 --> 18:38.185
We're both messed up.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.419
Who's L.D.P.?

18:39.452 --> 18:42.088
(laughs)
Lou Diamond Phillips.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.090
He played La Bamba.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.992
Mom dated him
for, like, three years.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.227
He was the best.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.761
La Bamba?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.633
(Young Faye laughs in video)

18:53.666 --> 18:55.635
YOUNG FAYE (on TV): I can't get
this bikini to stay on.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.270
Aftershock.

19:04.477 --> 19:09.115
Okay, well, how about
if two pelicans agree

19:09.148 --> 19:11.951
to fill their beaks with rocks
and jump into the ocean?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.420
That's not a parody.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.021
They actually did that
in the movie.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.756
(knocking at door)

19:16.789 --> 19:18.758
It's open!

19:18.791 --> 19:21.928
Hope this is really delicious.

19:21.961 --> 19:25.398
I had to pass up three gigs
to come back.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.166
Thanks for that.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.770
Sorry.

19:30.803 --> 19:34.641
Hey, did you know me and Edgar
served in Iraq together?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.476
Oh, yeah.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.910
Apparently he's real embarrassed

19:37.944 --> 19:39.912
for people to know
that he's a vet.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.182
I guess he thinks
he's better than me.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.817
But he ain't shit.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.521
Never was.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.193
You know what?

19:54.227 --> 19:55.928
Why don't you come over here

19:55.962 --> 19:58.498
and spread this chimichurri
sauce on my steak for me?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.468
(scoffs)

20:01.501 --> 20:04.003
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.506
(laughs)
You spread

20:06.539 --> 20:10.310
that chimichurri on my steak,

20:10.343 --> 20:13.780
this 50 is yours and you get
a five star rating.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.915
You don't...

20:15.948 --> 20:19.452
you get nothing
and I give you one star.

20:19.486 --> 20:22.088
I don't care either way,

20:22.121 --> 20:24.991
'cause 50 bucks
don't mean shit to me.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.826
Oh, damn.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.263
Uh... mm.

21:04.297 --> 21:07.300
(children shouting in video)

21:07.334 --> 21:09.769
(children laughing)

21:11.871 --> 21:14.774
Tag, you're it!

21:14.807 --> 21:17.043
-(clears throat)
-Mom!

21:17.076 --> 21:18.144
YOUNG FAYE (on TV):
Kids, please, please,

21:18.177 --> 21:19.145
get out of the frame, kids.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.813
Get out of the frame, kids!

21:20.847 --> 21:22.248
Thanks.
(clears throat)

21:22.281 --> 21:25.284
Faye Cottumaccio reading
for the role of Marsha.

21:25.318 --> 21:30.256
Mr. Belvedere,
did the agency send you?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.891
Have you guys noticed a pattern?

21:31.924 --> 21:33.560
It was the '80s, Gretch.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.528
You put some triangles
and squiggly lines on a shirt

21:35.562 --> 21:37.163
and called it fashion.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.164
(Lindsay chuckles)

21:38.197 --> 21:39.799
Your mother is completely

21:39.832 --> 21:41.601
neglecting you
in all these tapes.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.070
-Mom! Mom! -GRETCHEN: She
doesn't give a shit

21:44.103 --> 21:46.072
about anything you're doing.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.911
-Holy shit.
-You're right.

21:51.944 --> 21:55.348
It's Mom's fault you turned out
to be a giant toddler with boobs

21:55.382 --> 21:57.917
and I drink a touch too much
here and there.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.086
I am sorry, Becca.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.289
Me, too.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.592
We should tell her we're the
ones who need a break from her.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.427
BECCA:
What's the point?

22:07.460 --> 22:10.129
She'll just start crying and
tell us how she got the clap

22:10.162 --> 22:12.499
from the sound guy
on Trapper John, M.D.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.100
Bec.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.302
-Wha...?
-The only way our lives

22:16.335 --> 22:19.539
are going to get fixed
is if we fix them ourselves.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.745
You're right.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.719
She is.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.121
Yo, do you guys mind leaving
for a bit?

22:35.154 --> 22:36.623
I need some sleep.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.725
I closed my eyes to sneeze
a little while ago

22:38.758 --> 22:41.461
and I woke up
eight minutes later.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.663
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.364
(Katherine laughing)

22:45.398 --> 22:47.467
What about when we locked you
in the school basement

22:47.500 --> 22:49.068
and we wouldn't let you out

22:49.101 --> 22:51.404
until you put your little willy
through the keyhole?

22:51.438 --> 22:53.039
(Katherine laughs)

22:53.072 --> 22:55.174
It was so tiny.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.609
-Well, it's not anymore.
-(laughing)

22:56.643 --> 22:58.110
It's bigger now.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.646
And guess what?

22:59.679 --> 23:01.681
You just blew your chance
at ever seeing it.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.916
Oh! Oh, Jimmy!

23:03.950 --> 23:06.953
Did you think we might shag?
(laughs)

23:06.986 --> 23:09.355
All right.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.791
That's it!
I think we're done here.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.661
This was a complete waste
of time.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.296
I got nothing
out of this utter debacle!

23:17.329 --> 23:19.265
Me, neither.

23:19.298 --> 23:22.401
Do you promise it got bigger?

23:24.403 --> 23:27.674
(moaning, grunting)

23:34.413 --> 23:36.749
(faint grunting)

23:39.418 --> 23:43.322
* She was a shark smile
in a yellow van *

23:43.355 --> 23:47.193
* She came around
and I stole a glance *

23:47.226 --> 23:49.295
* In my youth, a vampire

23:49.328 --> 23:53.733
* Evelyn shown quiet
as roses sting *

23:53.766 --> 23:56.435
* It came over me
at a bad time... *

23:56.469 --> 23:59.205
Damn it.

23:59.238 --> 24:02.709
* But who wouldn't ride
on a moonlit line? *

24:02.742 --> 24:04.310
* Had her in my eye

24:04.343 --> 24:08.014
* 85 down the road
of a dead-end gleam *

24:08.047 --> 24:10.016
* And she said, "Woo"...

24:10.049 --> 24:12.819
Seriously,
what is wrong with me?

24:12.852 --> 24:16.222
(panting)

24:16.255 --> 24:18.190
* And I said, "Woo"

24:18.224 --> 24:23.530
* Baby, take me, too

24:23.563 --> 24:27.534
* It came over her
at a bad time *

24:27.567 --> 24:31.971
* Riding through Winona
down the dotted line *

24:32.004 --> 24:33.773
* Held us gunning out

24:33.806 --> 24:38.277
* 90 miles down the road
of a dead-end dream *

24:38.310 --> 24:42.248
* She looked over
with a part smile... *

24:42.281 --> 24:45.251
(dog barks)
