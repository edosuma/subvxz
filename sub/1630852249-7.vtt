WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:06.280
Oh, oh.

00:06.280 --> 00:07.840
Never fear, my sweet.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.080
For tonight, I shall..

00:12.920 --> 00:14.280
Free you from...

00:14.280 --> 00:17.680
..free you from
your father's cruel bonds.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.040
Gwen, you promised you'd be
word-perfect!

00:20.040 --> 00:24.880
We can't have prompting today
in front of the parents.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.040
We shall run away together.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.440
The sword, Gwen.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.440
Oh, and, and... Woe betide him
if he tries to stop us.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.480
Oh!

00:35.800 --> 00:38.160
Girls, do be careful!

00:38.160 --> 00:39.920
Can someone help me, please?

00:39.920 --> 00:42.080
Oh, for goodness' sake.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.840
I can't be excited about
Open Day,

00:49.840 --> 00:51.440
not knowing it might be our last.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.960
The school can't really be closing!

00:52.960 --> 00:55.680
Darrell saw it in writing.

00:57.880 --> 01:03.120
What is so tremendously interesting
that it cannot wait until lunch?

01:03.120 --> 01:07.080
Irene, perhaps you would
like to share it with us.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.920
When was I going to hear about
the school closing, Miss Grayling?

01:15.520 --> 01:17.280
I had to learn it from the girls.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.920
Nothing set in stone.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.120
I'm still doing my best to work
things out

01:21.120 --> 01:22.360
and today is crucial.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.040
I've worked here for 20 years.

01:24.040 --> 01:29.040
Please, Matron, it's imperative
that these rumours do not spread.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.320
I'd like you to speak to the girls
at once.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.400
If you cannot trust me with
the truth,

01:33.400 --> 01:35.560
then how can you trust me to speak
to the girls?

01:35.560 --> 01:37.640
I suggest you do it yourself.

01:43.240 --> 01:47.440
Miss Grayling, I'm utterly sorry,
but I picked up the dictionary

01:47.440 --> 01:49.440
and there was a letter underneath.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.840
You read my private mail?

01:50.840 --> 01:52.400
I didn't mean to read it,

01:52.400 --> 01:53.520
but I saw what it said.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.160
She didn't tell everyone, though.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.600
I was there and even I didn't know

01:56.600 --> 02:00.440
till Gwen read Darrell's diary
and told everyone about it.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.440
I am very disappointed in you both.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.480
I'm so, so sorry.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.560
Is it really true the school's
closing down?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.760
I must be honest with you, girls.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.080
Its future is under threat.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.400
Miss Grayling...

02:19.400 --> 02:20.880
Is there anything we can do to help?

02:20.880 --> 02:25.080
Yes. Promise to keep this
to yourselves, just for today.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.920
Are you asking us to lie?

02:26.920 --> 02:30.640
I'm asking you not to broadcast
private information.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.680
If parents panic,
staying open may not be possible.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.640
It sounds like it's not
possible anyway.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.520
There may still be a way
through.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.360
What? Some incredibly rich
businessmen may happen

02:40.360 --> 02:42.640
to stroll up and decide to give you
enough money

02:42.640 --> 02:45.080
to keep the school open?

02:45.080 --> 02:46.720
Wait, is that what's happening?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.440
Is that why today is so important?

02:48.440 --> 02:52.040
Crikey! I do hope to secure
a backer today, yes.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.320
The school must look its best.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.600
You must all shine.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.200
What if this businessman
isn't convinced?

03:01.200 --> 03:04.240
Then I'll make an announcement
after the play...

03:05.200 --> 03:07.600
..about the likelihood
of the school closing.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.680
Miss Grayling... You are dismissed.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.040
Darrell, before you go,
can I have a word?

03:18.040 --> 03:20.200
Am I in more trouble? Always.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.320
Not this time,
but I have some unfortunate news.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.080
Your father has to perform
an emergency operation today.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.360
He's not coming? Sorry.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.120
Neither he nor your mother
can be here, I'm afraid.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.240
But as you'll have time
on your hands,

03:36.240 --> 03:38.000
I have a task for you.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.360
Could you lead a small group
on a tour?

03:41.360 --> 03:43.760
Of course. Anything to make it
up to you.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.920
Just be the impressive ambassador
for the school I know you are.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.240
Since when did we do tours
on Open Day?

03:57.240 --> 03:59.160
Is this for the investor?

04:02.160 --> 04:04.320
Why would you trust her,
of all people,

04:04.320 --> 04:07.440
after she read
your private correspondence?

04:07.440 --> 04:09.600
Only if you trust people

04:09.600 --> 04:12.440
can they live up to your faith
in them.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.320
Was Miss Grayling terribly cross,
Darrell?

05:17.320 --> 05:18.440
No, it wasn't about that.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.440
I'm to lead a tour around
the school.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.280
I wonder who it is
I'll be showing around.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.360
Oh, there's your mother, Gwen.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.240
You're lucky she came,
despite it all.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.840
What are you talking about?

05:28.840 --> 05:30.920
Well, with your father being ill.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.040
Darrell Rivers, listen to me.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.520
Not a word about my father
being ill. Why?

05:35.520 --> 05:38.760
Because it would make Mother
terribly upset.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.560
It's making me upset thinking
about it.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.000
Darrell was only trying to be kind.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.280
Well, she shouldn't,
and neither should you.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.240
Neither of you must mention
a word about Daddy's illness.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.520
Promise?

05:48.520 --> 05:49.560
BOTH: Promise.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.520
Oh, dear.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.600
I did actually mention it
when I wrote to my granny.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.600
Don't worry, she probably
won't bring it up.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.200
But if she does, it just shows
you and she both care.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.760
Where's the harm in that?

06:03.880 --> 06:05.520
Mother, you look wonderful.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.600
Do I? Thank you.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.360
That's lovely! From Daddy.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.640
Real emeralds, you know,
to match my...

06:13.640 --> 06:15.280
Darling, your hair!

06:16.800 --> 06:18.960
It's for the play!
I'm the main part, you see.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.600
I can't wait for you to see it.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.560
I'm excited to see you in costume.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.920
Do you have a wonderful frock?

06:25.920 --> 06:27.720
Daddy's terribly sorry to miss it.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.360
He's terribly busy at the company,
but I promise to catch him up.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.280
Do you think he might lift
the punishment?

06:32.280 --> 06:33.680
That's between you and him.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.680
You know how disappointed
he was with you last term.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.720
Places such value on mucking in.

06:39.720 --> 06:40.840
Oh, but I am.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.760
I've been desperate all term.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.960
It's really hard to get by here
without pocket money.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.600
Well, let's see how today goes.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.520
And I'll think about making
the case to him.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.760
Yes, of course, but if a job vacancy
comes up,

07:02.760 --> 07:05.560
I have an unblemished...

07:02.760 --> 07:05.560
DISCONNECTED TONE

07:08.760 --> 07:11.600
Well, I wouldn't want to work
for you anyway.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.840
MATRON: Ah, yes, am I speaking
with...?

07:28.240 --> 07:30.000
And what time will she be back?

07:31.240 --> 07:32.560
Oh, yeah.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.800
Georgina... Oh!

07:34.880 --> 07:37.240
Mother, this is Georgina Thomas,
my friend,

07:37.240 --> 07:39.280
the one I wrote to you about.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.160
We're doing the play together,

07:41.160 --> 07:42.680
Gwendoline Mary Lacey.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.560
Ah, the famous Gwendoline.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.000
Francis Thomas.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.880
Sylvia Louise Mary Lacey.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.200
It's a real coup that Daddy's come.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.560
This is his first visit.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.280
He's normally far too busy.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.440
Well done, Gwendoline.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.960
The Thomases of Thomas Mines.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.000
Just the sort of friends Daddy
hoped you'd make.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.440
Hello, everyone.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.880
Sorry to break things up, but I need
those girls in the play...now.

08:05.880 --> 08:09.160
Come along, Gwen. Final rehearsals.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.040
Oh, Mother, you will be all right
on your own, won't you?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.840
We'll keep each other company.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.800
I'm being shown around the grounds
any minute.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.240
Why not join me on the school tour?
Why, thank you.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.960
Mr Thomas.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.360
Let me introduce you to Darrell,
your tour guide.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.160
I'm so pleased to meet you.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.880
I promise to give you the best
ever tour.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.200
No need for special treatment.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.680
I'd like to see the school
from the girls' perspective.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.360
Warts an' all. Bye, Daddy.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.840
Don't miss the play.
I won't. Come on.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.880
Remember, not a word about my
father. Right.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.320
So if you'd just like to walk this
way... Oh, Darrell!

08:51.320 --> 08:55.680
My granny's got an extra passenger,
so we've got one more for your tour.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.520
Oh, no, I don't know... Darrell!

08:58.520 --> 09:00.680
Felicity! How...?

09:00.680 --> 09:02.920
She was so upset at missing
Open Day.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.320
Daddy called and arranged
for me to come with...

09:06.320 --> 09:07.560
Granny Margo.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.440
That's what Mary-Lou calls me.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.040
And so may you both.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.360
Imagine, this will be my school
too in a few terms.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.080
I really want you to come along,

09:16.080 --> 09:18.520
but I've got a lot of responsibility
today.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.760
I'll help you. It'll be fun!

09:22.120 --> 09:25.120
Granny and I could come too.
For, um, moral support.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.480
Alicia, Alicia, quick!

09:37.480 --> 09:38.840
What?

09:38.840 --> 09:40.840
I think Matron's leaving. What?

09:42.680 --> 09:44.640
What are you two looking at?

09:44.640 --> 09:46.120
Ellen, back to bed.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.840
Are you going somewhere, Matron?

09:49.200 --> 09:51.280
I'm due some leave.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.880
Even we staff are allowed time off
sometimes.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.480
Has the school closure been
confirmed?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.240
She's been telephoning about
a new job.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.600
Have you been listening
into my private business, Ellen?

10:02.600 --> 10:03.960
No, I... Matron.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.240
How could you?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.880
We have to pull together
to save this school,

10:10.880 --> 10:12.920
not run like rats
from a sinking ship.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.000
Are you calling me a rat,
Ellen Wilson?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.120
We both are.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.920
Miss Grayling needs you, Matron.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.120
Well, if she needed me,
she would have told me before now.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.960
Sometimes you have to look after
number one.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.200
No-one else is going to do it.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.560
How am I going to look after number
one if the school shuts?

10:31.560 --> 10:33.720
Where am I going to go?
Won't your family...?

10:33.720 --> 10:35.280
I can't bear to go back to my aunt.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.880
I worked so hard to get away.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.720
Matron.

10:39.720 --> 10:43.560
Please, stay, help.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.120
Nothing I do will make
a difference now.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.400
And from here, we have a wonderful
view of

11:04.400 --> 11:06.520
our historic school buildings.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.160
Splendid. Gracious!

11:08.160 --> 11:10.560
There's quite a few cracks
in that roof.

11:10.560 --> 11:14.600
That must be why
there was a leak in your dorm.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.600
If you could please just walk
this way.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.760
And, over here, we have the natural
beauty

11:27.760 --> 11:29.680
of our own freshwater stream.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.760
The water's a bit cloudy.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.480
Interesting. Does it always look
that way?

11:34.480 --> 11:36.120
Well, I suppose it does,

11:36.120 --> 11:38.520
but the grounds sweep all the way
over to the sea

11:38.520 --> 11:41.240
and we have our own swimming pool.
A couple of rocks.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.560
It's extremely impressive.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.080
FELICITY: Darrell says everyone
loves it, except for Gwen.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.800
She's such a cowardy-custard.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.120
Oh, poor, Gwen.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.880
Don't be so hard on her, girls.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.880
After all, it can't be easy
with her father being so ill.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.000
How is Mr Lacey?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.640
I beg your pardon?

12:01.640 --> 12:05.320
Well, Mary-Lou told me the sad news
about his...

12:05.320 --> 12:07.640
His serious illness.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.720
Did she?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.680
I see.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.600
Girls, show me where this stream
goes.

12:33.640 --> 12:36.280
What's this Gwendoline said
about her father? I don't really...

12:36.280 --> 12:38.080
I don't remember. Of course you
remember

12:38.080 --> 12:39.360
if you told your grandmother.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.040
We should... Tell me
what my daughter said.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.720
All we know is that Mr Lacey
is very ill

12:50.720 --> 12:51.840
and we are very sorry.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.280
Tell Mr Thomas I've urgently
had to go back

12:55.280 --> 12:57.760
to the school. Mrs Lacey.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.680
Mrs Lacey, you can't go that way.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.760
I think you'll find I can go
any way. I... Argh!

13:03.000 --> 13:04.480
Help!

13:04.480 --> 13:06.440
Help me!

13:06.440 --> 13:11.120
Oh, oh, help me!

13:11.120 --> 13:12.480
Oh, wait there, wait! Oh!

13:12.480 --> 13:16.400
Now, don't move
or you really will get stuck.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.560
Why is it so muddy there, I wonder?

13:18.560 --> 13:20.200
My shoes!

13:20.200 --> 13:22.480
Everyone, one last time!

13:22.480 --> 13:24.560
Scene seven, from the top.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.600
Cue chicken.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.960
Here comes my valiant steed.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.160
Neigh! Neigh!

13:38.160 --> 13:39.880
Jean, the horse is not our star.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.880
Straight to Lady Jane, please.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.880
Do you want to sabotage this show?

13:51.520 --> 13:53.480
If we make a mat with these
branches...

13:53.480 --> 13:55.120
I'll get another branch!

13:55.120 --> 13:57.840
Thanks, but just stand back!

13:57.840 --> 14:00.280
Mr Thomas, let me, I'm lighter.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.680
Take my hand.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.800
Good show, Darrell Rivers!
Hang on, just one more.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.280
Oh, Mr Thomas! Argh!

14:12.280 --> 14:14.360
MR THOMAS GROANS

14:14.360 --> 14:16.160
Oh, no, no, no!

14:16.160 --> 14:18.400
Gracious!

14:28.840 --> 14:31.760
Please, Matron, we need you.
Please... No!

14:31.760 --> 14:34.080
What difference does it make to some
fat cat businessmen

14:34.080 --> 14:35.400
if one tower has a matron or not?

14:35.400 --> 14:37.920
Matron! Thank heavens!
We need your help.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.840
What's going on? It's the investor.
His suit is covered in mud.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.200
He won't be able to see the play.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.840
Well, it's probably
a jolly good thing. Not at all.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.520
Him seeing his daughter as the star

14:46.520 --> 14:48.440
is our last chance
to get him to invest.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.960
There's no way I can clean and dry
a suit ahead of the play starting.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.200
I know what you could do, though!

15:02.760 --> 15:07.000
Gwendoline?
Sorry, it's Georgina. Gwen?

15:09.120 --> 15:11.600
What is that absurd outfit?

15:11.600 --> 15:14.720
I thought you said you were
the lead. I am! The Highwayman.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.000
Fast Jack.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.040
I need to talk to you now.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.600
No, I can't.
The play's about to start.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.680
You have a lot of explaining to do,
my girl.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.280
I'm covered in mud.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.280
And what's this about
your father's health?

15:28.280 --> 15:32.640
What? I've been utterly humiliated.
And in front of Mr Thomas, too.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.000
How could you put me
in this position?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.440
I... Everyone offering me
consolation for my sick husband.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.480
Why would you lie like that?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.480
I didn't mean to.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.280
It was a mistake.
A misunderstanding.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.600
Gwen, we need you.
Hurry. We're about to start.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.000
I have to go, Mother.
We can continue this afterwards.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.880
Can't possibly sit through a play
after the upset you've caused me!

15:56.880 --> 15:59.880
And I will be telling your father
all about this.

16:02.360 --> 16:06.480
No! Mother, please don't tell
Father anything. Please!

16:10.760 --> 16:12.120
Come on.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.720
You know, Mary-Lou was so happy...

16:29.400 --> 16:31.280
Matron's helping Mr Thomas
with his suit.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.760
It's all going to be all right.
No, it isn't.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.760
Gwen ran off, it's almost curtains
up and we have no Highwayman.

16:36.760 --> 16:40.600
There's no way we can win around
Mr Thomas now. No, wait... We can.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.680
We don't have to have Gwen.
How's that?

16:43.680 --> 16:46.760
Darrell knows the lines better
than Gwen. That's not saying much...

16:46.760 --> 16:49.960
You can do the part instead.
No, I don't think... You must!

16:49.960 --> 16:51.320
Smashing idea. We need you.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.360
This is our last chance
to win Mr Kelly over.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.720
He needs to see his princess
starring in the play.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.160
Come on. I can't do this... Sword!

16:59.160 --> 17:01.280
Hat! You have to.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.480
Come on, you've got this,
break a leg!

17:03.480 --> 17:05.160
The show must go on.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.360
Miss Grayling. May I? Thank you.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.480
Is that my suit?!

17:22.480 --> 17:24.560
Shhh! It's for the greater good.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.760
PIANO PLAYS INTRO

welcome to the Summit of Love.

APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

17:32.880 --> 17:34.760
DISTANT APPLAUSE

17:50.160 --> 17:52.920
PLAY CONTINUES IN DISTANCE

17:55.800 --> 17:57.880
..Jack, must it be tonight?

17:59.880 --> 18:03.000
Gwendoline.
I'm so pleased you're here.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Mother, I thought you'd gone!

18:05.000 --> 18:08.200
I must have lost my new brooch
on that dreadful tour.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.280
Come along.
I need you to help me find it.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.240
..tonight is our last night....

18:13.240 --> 18:16.240
Gwendoline?
I don't like to ask twice.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.000
DISTANT APPLAUSE

18:29.560 --> 18:31.640
Simply enthralling!

18:31.640 --> 18:34.640
PIANO PLAYS GENTLY

18:38.960 --> 18:40.360
Never fear, my sweet.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.120
Tomorrow night, I shall free you
from your father's cruel bonds.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.920
We shall run away together!
And woe...

18:50.040 --> 18:51.280
What's wrong?

18:57.440 --> 18:59.920
..and-and woe betide him
who tries to stop us.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.880
APPLAUSE

19:07.120 --> 19:08.800
Must be here somewhere.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.480
You will tell Daddy I helped out,
won't you?

19:11.480 --> 19:13.920
You think this makes up for the lies
you told about him,

19:13.920 --> 19:16.200
you've got another think coming.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.120
We'll try that way.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.880
# We came here as girls
to be women of the world

19:44.880 --> 19:47.400
# And we'll do so with prosperity. #

19:47.400 --> 19:49.080
APPLAUSE

19:47.400 --> 19:49.080
Encore!

19:51.680 --> 19:55.560
Encore! Wonderful!

19:58.160 --> 20:01.920
Miss Grayling, please don't say
anything yet. There's still time.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.240
Ladies and gentlemen, girls...

20:10.240 --> 20:13.680
..I have important news
about the future of Malory Towers.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.760
Important and wonderful news.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.080
Perhaps you heard a rumour

20:19.080 --> 20:21.520
that Malory Towers
was threatened with closure.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.800
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

20:24.800 --> 20:29.440
Georgina's father, Mr Thomas,
is investing in the school

20:29.440 --> 20:34.480
and with me will lead the school
to a new, prosperous future!

20:40.600 --> 20:44.400
Everywhere I've been today,
I have seen resourceful girls

20:44.400 --> 20:48.000
and staff pulling together
for the greater good.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.360
This show was no exception.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.880
I'm impressed.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.600
And I've really enjoyed myself.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.080
Thank you.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.440
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

21:07.000 --> 21:08.760
Malory Towers forever!

21:08.760 --> 21:11.040
Whoo! Hooray!

21:24.280 --> 21:25.800
Bye, Daddy. Bye, darling.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.600
Well done again. The show was
really, really first-rate.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.520
Thank you. Margot.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.560
Margot!

21:36.160 --> 21:38.880
Oh! I love you, darling.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.360
It's good to see you.
See you soon. Mwah!

21:49.360 --> 21:51.240
Thank heavens you saved the day.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.280
I so desperately want to come here,
just as soon as I'm old enough.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.800
Well, now you can.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.640
HORN HONKS

22:14.960 --> 22:17.160
Do tell your father we think
he's ever so wonderful

22:17.160 --> 22:19.600
for saving the school.
Well, you can tell him yourself.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.440
He's coming back next week
to go through the details

22:22.440 --> 22:24.600
and to give Mr Parker back his suit.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.880
That was quite a performance.

22:29.880 --> 22:33.280
Darrell, thank you
for everything you did today.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.720
Mr Thomas spoke very highly
of your tour.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.920
Matron!

22:40.920 --> 22:42.640
Are you leaving?

22:42.640 --> 22:45.560
Oh, I have leave owing.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.600
I was going to take a weekend away,

22:47.600 --> 22:50.600
but...if you need me,
I suppose I can stay.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.240
Your quick thinking with
Mr Parker's clothes saved the day.

22:56.240 --> 22:59.240
Ah, no, we have Ellen to thank
for that idea.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.960
It was very sporting of him.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.120
Malory Towers needs you
more than ever.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.440
Please stay.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.320
The summer holidays will be here
before you know it.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.040
Marvellous!
So glad Matron's staying.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.920
Let's get back to the others.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.800
What a day...

23:18.080 --> 23:19.760
Darrell, look.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.960
..terrible day...
I'm so sorry.

23:24.960 --> 23:28.040
Poor Gwen.
I think we got her into trouble.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.200
GWEN'S MOTHER CONTINUES COMPLAINING

23:37.080 --> 23:39.800
Here's the car. I must go.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.680
I don't know how I'll face
your father without my brooch.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.760
I'll keep looking. If I find it,
I'll be sure to let you know.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.080
Goodbye, Mother.
