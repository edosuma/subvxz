00:09.250 --> 00:13.166
Man has always puzzled over his origin.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.166
His genesis.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.166
Created by God?

00:17.250 --> 00:20.166
Or a product of evolution?

00:21.250 --> 00:23.166
If we could see yesterday and tomorrow

00:23.250 --> 00:25.166
at the same time,

00:25.708 --> 00:28.166
the origin and the end,

00:28.250 --> 00:31.333
the entire universe in a single moment,

00:31.416 --> 00:34.333
we might finally find answers

00:34.416 --> 00:36.208
to the biggest questions of all.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.708
What is man?

00:38.791 --> 00:40.166
Where does he come from?

00:40.250 --> 00:42.041
What drives him?

00:43.166 --> 00:44.666
What is his purpose?

02:19.250 --> 02:24.291
EVERYTHING IS NOW

02:38.250 --> 02:42.250
AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT
NUCLEAR POWER FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD!

02:51.666 --> 02:54.291
The boys they found
at the construction site...

02:56.041 --> 02:58.375
Do you think
someone did the same thing with him?

02:58.458 --> 02:59.291
Or...

03:00.041 --> 03:03.583
maybe I gave him
too much of a scolding about the pants.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.791
Maybe that's why he ran away.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.583
Where are you going?

03:16.375 --> 03:17.625
To the police.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.125
Good morning.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.541
Doppler's here.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.083
In your office.

03:50.541 --> 03:51.916
Says his boy has disappeared.

03:52.458 --> 03:55.541
Maybe you were right
about there being more to come.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.833
There was a man here yesterday.

03:59.958 --> 04:01.875
He said that his son had disappeared.

04:02.541 --> 04:05.458
He wanted to know
if one of the dead children was his boy.

04:06.291 --> 04:07.750
What man?

04:07.833 --> 04:09.458
I don't know, but...

04:10.666 --> 04:12.291
he asked about Doppler's boy.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.916
Tell the officers and put out an APB.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.875
And not a word to Doppler!

04:26.375 --> 04:27.583
Mr. Doppler.

04:31.500 --> 04:35.708
Mr. Kahnwald told me that...
your son has gone missing.

04:36.750 --> 04:37.916
Yes, since yesterday.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.625
And when was that exactly?

04:41.708 --> 04:44.541
My wife said it was around three o'clock.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.083
Mr. Tiedemann.

04:58.416 --> 05:00.583
I want you to find my son.

05:01.208 --> 05:03.708
Whatever it costs.
I don't care about anything else.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.375
The nuclear plant, anything at all.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.875
Just bring me back my son.

05:19.416 --> 05:20.500
Gretchen!

05:22.208 --> 05:23.208
Gretchen!

05:24.083 --> 05:25.875
Here, Gretchen!

05:25.958 --> 05:26.958
Come here!

05:28.125 --> 05:29.541
Gretchen!

05:32.958 --> 05:36.000
You almost look like James Dean
with that haircut.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.708
The girls in Winden
will be after you in droves.

05:38.791 --> 05:40.041
You'll see.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.416
Do you have a girlfriend?

05:48.750 --> 05:51.000
Why did you leave where you come from?

05:52.041 --> 05:53.583
Are you bank robbers on the run?

05:57.083 --> 05:59.041
My mother wanted a change.

05:59.916 --> 06:04.500
Your mother is a very beautiful woman.
I've never seen anyone so elegant.

06:10.500 --> 06:14.166
I feel like the Queen of England
has invited me to tea.

06:17.583 --> 06:18.625
Turn around.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.458
You're beautiful.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.333
The Queen would be glad to have you visit.

06:44.875 --> 06:45.875
It's yours.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.875
No. What would Egon say?

06:50.958 --> 06:52.500
What could he say?

06:58.625 --> 07:00.875
How long were you married?

07:00.958 --> 07:02.291
Fifteen years.

07:02.791 --> 07:04.958
It's been nearly ten for Egon and me.

07:06.416 --> 07:08.500
But somehow everything has changed.

07:09.666 --> 07:11.208
He has changed.

07:11.833 --> 07:14.416
He's not home as much as he used to be.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.416
His work.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.500
What kind of work did your husband do?

07:21.500 --> 07:22.750
He was a pastor.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.875
But I can't say he was a man of faith.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.208
Do you miss him a lot?

07:31.583 --> 07:33.208
He wasn't a good person.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.041
Sometimes I think it's good he's dead.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.333
And that I'm free.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.375
I can't accept it. I'd better take it off.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.500
I prayed to God

07:50.000 --> 07:53.750
to get rid of the child
before it was ever born.

07:55.125 --> 07:58.541
And after I had him, I prayed every day

07:59.041 --> 08:01.208
that something would befall him.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.250
Because he may not be Bernd's child.

08:10.916 --> 08:14.541
Because maybe he wasn't a child
created out of love, but...

08:21.500 --> 08:23.291
That's what's in my head.

08:24.958 --> 08:26.541
Every day.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.750
I can't escape it.

08:31.833 --> 08:33.458
It's my fault.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.958
We are all full of sin.

08:39.416 --> 08:42.708
No pure human being exists.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.000
But no matter what we do,

08:48.083 --> 08:51.500
we never fall any lower
than into God's hands.

08:56.791 --> 08:59.041
And what if they aren't God's hands?

09:00.041 --> 09:02.625
What if they are the hands of the devil?

09:02.708 --> 09:06.208
God sent me to you. Did he not?

09:06.291 --> 09:08.958
We don't meet the people we meet
by accident.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.416
We touch the lives of others
and are touched ourselves,

09:14.500 --> 09:19.500
and thus God's hands guide us
to our true destiny.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.291
Let us pray.

09:25.375 --> 09:28.416
Even though I walk
through the darkest valley,

09:28.750 --> 09:30.583
I will fear no evil...

09:31.916 --> 09:33.875
for you are with me...

09:38.541 --> 09:40.875
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

09:41.708 --> 09:45.208
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

09:46.333 --> 09:50.166
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.

09:50.250 --> 09:54.625
Surely your goodness and love
will follow me all the days of my life,

09:54.708 --> 09:57.541
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.125
Stop there!

10:22.375 --> 10:23.208
Stop!

10:24.416 --> 10:25.708
Police!

10:27.708 --> 10:28.541
Stop!

10:30.333 --> 10:31.166
Stop!

10:32.625 --> 10:33.916
Stop! Police!

10:59.875 --> 11:01.250
Stop!

11:05.541 --> 11:06.708
Hands up!

11:08.958 --> 11:12.541
What did you do to the two boys
at the construction site?

11:13.708 --> 11:15.000
Where's Helge?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.250
That was you too.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.750
The two boys? That's impossible.

11:21.125 --> 11:24.791
They can't be there. I changed that.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.000
What did you change?

11:29.625 --> 11:30.833
The course of time.

11:31.416 --> 11:32.250
Helge's dead.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.875
Helge will never be able to kill again.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.750
You're a madman!

11:37.750 --> 11:38.833
Go on, turn around.

11:39.541 --> 11:40.375
Turn around!

11:41.375 --> 11:43.333
Down! On your knees!

11:46.458 --> 11:47.333
But I changed it.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.083
Get up!

11:50.750 --> 11:51.750
But I changed it.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.250
Piss off.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.875
I just wanted to know,
is Ulrich still in prison?

13:17.375 --> 13:19.125
They have to release him today.

13:21.541 --> 13:24.500
Did Tiedemann say who told him?

13:30.125 --> 13:31.958
And you and Ulrich?

13:32.916 --> 13:34.708
-What about us?
-I don't know.

13:34.791 --> 13:37.458
Won't your mom freak out
if you keep seeing him?

13:37.541 --> 13:39.166
I don't care.

13:39.250 --> 13:42.541
Nobody's going to come between us.
That's love, you know.

13:43.250 --> 13:46.333
It's stronger than hate.
But you don't get that yet.

13:49.833 --> 13:52.208
If I find out who told the cops that...

13:52.958 --> 13:54.500
I'm going to clobber them.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.833
Maybe it was Regina.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.833
I mean, Tiedemann is her grandfather.

14:06.833 --> 14:08.041
See you.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.833
I've been a police officer
for over 40 years.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.541
Your face.

14:39.625 --> 14:42.500
Your stare. I know that stare.

14:43.291 --> 14:46.000
I know that you've got something to hide.

14:48.083 --> 14:51.166
That you've got
something to do with all of this.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.500
-I can feel it in my bones.
-Maybe it's cancer.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.375
You might want to get that checked out.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.875
I want you to stay away from our family.

15:19.666 --> 15:22.958
And I'm going to make sure
you're taken off Mads' case.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.125
Gretchen?

16:49.750 --> 16:51.708
I can't believe you were in jail.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.125
That's really harsh.

17:03.791 --> 17:05.916
Why does Tiedemann have it in for you?

17:06.291 --> 17:08.416
He thinks I'm the Antichrist.

17:18.791 --> 17:20.208
Hey, Tiedemann!

17:20.791 --> 17:21.708
Damn four-eyes!

17:25.500 --> 17:29.333
I know what you did.
You trying to get me back for the summer?

17:29.416 --> 17:32.666
It was a game. We wouldn't have left you
hanging there all night.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.583
We couldn't have known
you were so damn fragile!

17:37.416 --> 17:38.625
I have to go.

17:39.833 --> 17:42.916
See this? My mom did this. And why?

17:43.583 --> 17:46.916
-Because you fed your grandpa bullshit!
-I didn't. Honest.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.916
Rape!
Is that the best you could come up with?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.250
Come on, Katharina!

17:54.000 --> 17:55.541
You make me sick!

18:03.250 --> 18:05.708
-Where are you going?
-Hey, stop!

18:06.166 --> 18:09.291
-Screw off! It's none of your business.
-I told you to stop.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.666
And I told you to screw off.

18:15.208 --> 18:16.458
Apologize to her.

18:20.875 --> 18:23.041
I said you should apologize.

18:26.708 --> 18:28.583
And how do I know it's real?

18:38.041 --> 18:40.583
You two get the hell out of here,
and fast.

18:40.666 --> 18:42.708
And if you hurt her again,

18:43.416 --> 18:44.583
I'll finish you.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.250
Everything's okay.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.583
Thanks.

19:14.041 --> 19:15.083
You're bleeding.

19:19.666 --> 19:22.833
-It's not so bad.
-You have to see a doctor.

19:30.416 --> 19:31.916
We have bandages at home.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.416
My mother isn't home.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.750
I can do it.

19:40.458 --> 19:41.708
What's your name?

19:43.833 --> 19:45.333
Aleksander.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.166
Tell me exactly what happened
in the summer.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.083
I already told you.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.333
An incident.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.125
-In the volume control system.
-That's not good enough for me.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.041
The connections to the chemical
feed-in system were corroded.

20:19.125 --> 20:23.208
Hydrogen gas must have collected
in one of the tubes.

20:23.291 --> 20:24.125
Boom!

20:24.791 --> 20:26.833
It wasn't a precaution.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.833
-That's why the tubes were changed.
-It is what we make of it.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.208
And what the reports say.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.625
We were lucky.

20:38.208 --> 20:41.541
Only an insignificant amount
of radioactive material leaked out.

20:41.625 --> 20:46.583
We had the entire floor removed
and stored everything in a safe place.

20:46.666 --> 20:48.000
You call that a safe place?

20:48.083 --> 20:51.833
As safe as any other
official interim storage facility.

20:59.541 --> 21:02.625
-Who knows about it?
-It happened during the nightshift.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.500
The shift supervisor,
a handful of employees, Helge.

21:08.833 --> 21:12.500
No one will talk,
they all got a fat bonus.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.541
Don't make
a bigger deal out of it than it is.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.250
In the night...

21:26.333 --> 21:29.416
Was there more? Did anything else happen?

21:29.500 --> 21:30.750
Anything strange?

21:32.083 --> 21:33.583
In the cave, anything...

21:34.166 --> 21:38.625
-Anything the explosion may have...
-Just what might have happened there?

21:43.291 --> 21:47.833
Do you believe that Hannibal
marched over the Alps with elephants?

21:49.666 --> 21:52.708
There are no truths, just stories.

21:53.166 --> 21:56.291
And the story of this city
is now in your hands.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.291
Is our power plant safe?

21:59.375 --> 22:02.791
Can something like Chernobyl
happen in our plant?

22:03.291 --> 22:07.208
You decide what story you want to tell.

22:40.291 --> 22:43.666
10:30 A.M. INTERVIEW: HELGE DOPPLER
WHY NOT FOREST PATH?

23:58.375 --> 23:59.208
Helge?

24:01.083 --> 24:02.083
Helge!

26:06.958 --> 26:08.291
Aleksander Köhler.

26:09.791 --> 26:13.583
Born January 21, 1965.

26:53.166 --> 26:56.541
A young man is here to see you.
He said he's your daughter's friend.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.375
-Her friend?
-Yes.

26:58.458 --> 27:01.583
He's looking for work,
if I understood him correctly.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.083
Yes.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.791
I'm Aleksander.

27:16.916 --> 27:20.000
So you're a friend of my daughter's?

27:21.625 --> 27:24.500
And all this time
I thought she didn't care about boys.

27:27.208 --> 27:29.500
I'm new in town. Looking for work.

27:30.291 --> 27:33.083
Regina told me
you might be able to help me.

27:33.166 --> 27:35.541
-Do you have training?
-I'm a metalworker.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.666
I can work. Hard.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.208
I'm a fast learner.

27:40.916 --> 27:42.208
You're not from here?

27:43.125 --> 27:44.750
All I'm asking for is a chance.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.500
I'm sorry.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.625
We don't need anyone at the moment.

27:56.291 --> 27:59.291
But maybe we will soon.
Where can I reach you?

28:00.625 --> 28:03.041
I'll just come by again tomorrow.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.583
Why doesn't it work?

28:47.458 --> 28:50.125
It will. Be patient.

28:51.291 --> 28:53.708
Do you think Einstein
would have given up so fast?

28:54.625 --> 28:58.541
It is the fate of pioneers
to persistently pursue their aim.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.875
To believe, although no one believes.

29:03.125 --> 29:04.250
I don't want to do this anymore.

29:07.375 --> 29:09.666
Why would God want any of this?

29:11.708 --> 29:12.541
Yes.

29:16.041 --> 29:17.916
Why would God want any of this?

29:21.041 --> 29:25.250
After looking into hell,
as you have, it can never be forgotten.

29:25.333 --> 29:26.625
It becomes a part of you.

29:28.208 --> 29:32.833
And the idea of God, of Jesus the Savior,
becomes a thread of hope you cling to.

29:36.083 --> 29:39.458
All of us who know the darkness
long for the light, but...

29:39.541 --> 29:41.416
there is no God!

29:41.500 --> 29:43.708
God didn't make this hole among us.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.041
God doesn't have a plan.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.166
There is no plan at all.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.333
There's nothing but chaos out there.

29:51.708 --> 29:52.583
Pain...

29:53.541 --> 29:54.958
and chaos!

30:08.250 --> 30:09.958
People are bad.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.958
Malicious, evil.

30:13.750 --> 30:16.458
Life is nothing but a spiral of pain.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.583
And the world is doomed to be destroyed.

30:20.666 --> 30:22.083
But this here...

30:23.291 --> 30:25.041
This is our ark.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.541
And I'm Noah.

30:28.333 --> 30:31.166
If we can harness this energy,
we can change everything.

30:31.250 --> 30:33.083
Then we decide the world's fate,

30:33.166 --> 30:36.833
far removed from all the evil
and from all pain.

30:39.208 --> 30:41.250
We'll create a time machine

30:43.708 --> 30:47.833
that reorders everything,
the beginning and the end.

32:00.583 --> 32:05.000
Charlotte, the question isn't
who kidnapped the children, but when?

32:05.083 --> 32:09.750
I was right. Helge Doppler.
Not now, but in 1986.

32:09.833 --> 32:12.041
Call me back immediately
when you hear this.

32:15.666 --> 32:17.041
Where's Ulrich?

32:17.125 --> 32:18.333
I thought he was with you.

32:19.166 --> 32:21.625
I tried to reach him,
but his phone is off.

32:21.708 --> 32:24.916
-Was he not here yesterday either?
-Don't you know?

32:25.291 --> 32:27.750
-Do I know what?
-He's suspended.

32:28.458 --> 32:31.166
I thought it was better
if he was with you guys.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.333
It's better if he's with us?

32:33.416 --> 32:36.041
You think we sit at home holding hands?

32:36.583 --> 32:37.916
I'm an idiot!

32:38.000 --> 32:41.125
Our son is missing, and he's got
nothing better to do than screw that slut.

32:47.291 --> 32:49.791
No, Charlotte, it isn't better this way!

33:16.083 --> 33:17.083
I have to go.

33:28.708 --> 33:29.541
Here.

33:31.916 --> 33:33.208
Where did you get it?

33:34.125 --> 33:35.958
I found it under the bridge.

33:36.458 --> 33:40.125
Just because we fuck doesn't mean
you have to know everything about me.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.500
I don't want to hurt you, okay?

33:48.375 --> 33:50.000
I want to know who you are.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.375
Who you really are.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.166
Not today, okay?

34:33.958 --> 34:36.875
Hey, it's me.
Call me back, for crying out loud!

34:46.041 --> 34:47.291
Franziska?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.208
Martha.

35:04.708 --> 35:07.541
Why is it that we all keep secrets
from one another?

35:11.083 --> 35:13.250
Some things
you just want to keep to yourself.

35:27.833 --> 35:30.291
-Katharina! This is a surprise.
-Where is he?

35:31.166 --> 35:32.250
Who?

35:33.833 --> 35:35.958
Don't act so stupid. Ulrich!

35:36.541 --> 35:37.833
Is he here?

35:38.708 --> 35:39.541
No.

35:40.333 --> 35:41.958
Why would he be here?

35:42.958 --> 35:44.958
You lying piece of shit!

35:46.333 --> 35:48.125
How long has it been going on?

35:48.208 --> 35:50.583
A month? Half a year?

35:50.666 --> 35:51.833
Or longer?

35:53.541 --> 35:54.375
I...

35:55.375 --> 35:57.416
-I...
-I... I... I... !

35:58.125 --> 36:02.125
I don't know where my son is!
And I don't know where my husband is!

36:02.208 --> 36:04.541
My husband! Do you understand?

36:07.041 --> 36:08.583
Did you fuck here?

36:10.625 --> 36:11.958
Or here?

36:12.041 --> 36:13.041
Here!

36:13.500 --> 36:16.166
Or in my house? In my bed?

36:16.250 --> 36:17.541
He isn't here.

36:19.666 --> 36:21.000
Is it fun for you?

36:22.166 --> 36:23.000
Yeah?

36:23.250 --> 36:26.375
Does it turn you on?
Destroying the lives of others?

36:26.458 --> 36:28.500
My life and my children's lives?

36:29.500 --> 36:33.041
Did you think about that when you
stuck your scrawny ass out for him?

36:41.583 --> 36:42.708
It's over.

36:45.250 --> 36:46.458
It's over.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.041
I ended it.

37:24.625 --> 37:26.458
I never wanted any of it.

37:29.708 --> 37:30.541
But...

37:31.583 --> 37:33.291
he just didn't let up.

37:35.041 --> 37:36.500
You know how he can be.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.666
He wanted to leave you.

37:42.625 --> 37:45.541
I told him that was crazy.

37:47.916 --> 37:49.958
He said that he didn't love you anymore.

37:52.583 --> 37:54.416
That he loves me.

37:59.458 --> 38:02.208
But I want you to know
that it's over now, Katharina.

38:06.541 --> 38:07.916
It's over.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.333
Can I help you?

38:56.625 --> 38:58.250
You must be Bartosz.

38:58.916 --> 39:00.500
I'm Claudia, your grandmother.

39:01.916 --> 39:03.125
Is your mother home?

39:04.750 --> 39:07.625
My mother told me
you died before I was born.

39:07.708 --> 39:11.083
I'm sure your mother
told you lots of stories about me.

39:11.791 --> 39:13.333
Only some of them are true.

39:15.916 --> 39:18.000
It looks much different than it did.

39:18.083 --> 39:19.875
There was no addition.

39:20.916 --> 39:23.416
Why did Mom tell me you're dead?

39:23.500 --> 39:25.625
For your mom, I'm sure I am.

39:28.750 --> 39:31.125
I wasn't a particularly good mother,
you know.

39:32.333 --> 39:34.291
You're a lot like the two of them.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.333
Your eyes.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.083
Your chin.

39:38.916 --> 39:41.208
You look a lot like your parents.

39:47.791 --> 39:49.333
If you're not dead,

39:50.958 --> 39:52.458
where were you all these years?

39:54.500 --> 39:56.166
That's a long story.

39:56.708 --> 39:58.500
Maybe I'll tell you one day.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.625
Regina won't be home till late.

40:00.708 --> 40:03.208
-Are you going to wait or...?
-Not today.

40:04.416 --> 40:06.208
I have to take care of something.

40:09.791 --> 40:13.416
I want you to give her this.
Will you do that for me?

40:15.791 --> 40:17.750
That was before.

40:18.250 --> 40:21.291
Before that summer
and everything else that followed it.

40:24.208 --> 40:26.916
I made lots of mistakes back then.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.958
Believe me, if I could turn back time,

40:33.833 --> 40:36.000
I would do lots of things differently.

41:15.041 --> 41:16.666
Yes, that's good.

41:17.958 --> 41:19.291
That's good.

41:19.833 --> 41:21.250
Just a second.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.375
Do you recognize it?

41:45.833 --> 41:48.750
All these years
I've wondered why I kept it.

41:50.250 --> 41:52.500
But there's a time for everything.

41:54.083 --> 41:55.583
Don't worry.

41:56.041 --> 41:58.041
The contents are in safe keeping.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.875
What do you want?

42:00.958 --> 42:04.291
Why do some people have everything
and some nothing?

42:06.041 --> 42:08.375
Why do you and Regina
have a beautiful home

42:08.458 --> 42:10.541
and I can't even pay my electrical bill?

42:12.083 --> 42:16.166
Why does fate predestine
a good life for some and not for others?

42:16.250 --> 42:19.250
-Do you want money?
-I don't want any money.

42:19.333 --> 42:21.541
I want you to do me a favor.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.166
I want you to destroy Ulrich.

42:29.166 --> 42:30.541
I want him to lose everything.

42:34.208 --> 42:35.291
Everything.

42:43.458 --> 42:46.333
How am I supposed to do that?
What do you have in mind?

42:48.875 --> 42:53.166
I don't give a damn how you do it
or who you pay, just destroy him!

42:58.791 --> 43:00.458
Boris Niewald.

43:01.291 --> 43:04.625
Interesting name.
I think it suits you much better.

43:42.375 --> 43:43.208
Hello.

43:44.958 --> 43:45.791
Hello.

43:52.333 --> 43:54.791
-I have to go.
-You have to go?

43:56.958 --> 43:59.000
Can you tell me what's going on?

44:00.000 --> 44:03.083
I've been trying to reach you for days,
and you don't even write back!

44:11.583 --> 44:13.000
What was that after rehearsal?

44:18.000 --> 44:19.375
You just make out with me.

44:19.791 --> 44:23.500
Did you think, "The chick's unstable,
so I'll take what I can get"?

44:27.958 --> 44:29.708
God, say something!

44:41.708 --> 44:43.000
It was wrong.

44:44.083 --> 44:46.541
-What was wrong?
-The thing with us.

44:49.041 --> 44:50.458
It wasn't right.

44:55.916 --> 44:57.375
Because of Bartosz?

45:01.375 --> 45:03.041
No, not because of Bartosz.

45:04.916 --> 45:06.208
Because of us.

45:07.958 --> 45:08.791
It...

45:14.541 --> 45:16.458
We're just not a good match, okay?

45:20.208 --> 45:21.708
We're not a good match?

45:22.375 --> 45:24.291
Yeah, we're not a good match.

45:26.291 --> 45:28.041
The whole thing is wrong.

45:29.750 --> 45:31.250
We're wrong.

45:54.833 --> 45:56.458
So this is wrong?

46:05.291 --> 46:06.666
I'm sorry.

46:16.416 --> 46:18.666
I want you to do me a favor.

46:19.541 --> 46:22.500
I need information on Ulrich Nielsen.

46:22.583 --> 46:25.041
-Anything that could be useful.
-Okay.

46:26.125 --> 46:27.833
And what'll we do with the truck?

46:27.916 --> 46:29.208
In a few days,

46:29.916 --> 46:31.750
when everything has calmed down,

46:32.083 --> 46:34.041
we'll bring the barrels back.

47:48.208 --> 47:50.541
WHEN IS MIKKEL?

48:40.208 --> 48:41.708
You were right.

48:42.875 --> 48:45.500
Everything you predicted has happened.

48:51.125 --> 48:53.416
Did you think about my offer?

48:59.375 --> 49:00.208
Yes.

49:06.250 --> 49:09.625
I have work for you, but on one condition.

49:09.708 --> 49:11.541
You can't speak of it.

49:12.666 --> 49:14.041
With anyone.

49:15.875 --> 49:17.208
When do I start?

49:56.500 --> 50:00.291
Blowjob, 50 euros.
You can feel me up between the legs too.

50:04.166 --> 50:05.291
Well, forget it then.

50:05.708 --> 50:07.708
You have no idea what you're missing.

51:23.708 --> 51:24.708
Can I help you?

51:32.250 --> 51:34.000
We're actually closed.

51:37.083 --> 51:40.208
I think I have something
that could interest you.

51:47.708 --> 51:49.666
I want you to build this for me.

51:51.583 --> 51:53.166
What's that supposed to be?

51:56.083 --> 51:59.791
It's something
that will set the course of time straight.
