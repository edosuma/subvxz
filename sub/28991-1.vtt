08:38.585 --> 08:40.018
You missed your appointment,
homey.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.754
Man, I had some things going on
at my restaurant.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.524

08:45.526 --> 08:47.058
I'm'a violate you.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.927
And you get pulled over,
your ass is going back to jail.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.195
I'm'a tell you that right now.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.796
You got a couple of days
to get in here,

08:51.798 --> 08:54.666
give me some pee,
and kiss my ass.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.536
Roger that. He's working.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.906
Man, I ain't going back to jail.
Shit.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.275
- Fuck I did?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Slowly.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.010
Look, man.
I ain't got nothing on me.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.311
- Okay. All right. That's fine.
- I'm good.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.913
- That's fine. Okay.
- Yeah.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.314
Please, all right?
Just calm down, all right?

09:09.316 --> 09:10.949
- Don't resist.
- What's the problem, Officer?

09:10.951 --> 09:12.817
Nothing, Chester Cheeto, okay?

09:12.819 --> 09:14.319
Why don't you, uh, turn around
and put your hands on the car?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.878
Dana, what the hell
is wrong with you?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.913
Why would you yank
in front of me like that?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.315
Are you trying to kill somebody?

09:43.317 --> 09:45.650
I'm sorry. I didn't see you,
Officer Miller.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.252
<i>Detective</i> Miller.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.687
- Oh, you think this is funny?
- No.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.355
I'm gonna walk you play by play,
okay?

09:50.357 --> 09:51.957
First, we locked eyes.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.325
You want to know how I know
we locked eyes?

09:53.327 --> 09:55.193
Because I saw your crazy ass
looking at me.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.895
I didn't want to look,
but out of respect,

09:56.897 --> 09:58.797
I looked back at you,
but then guess what you did.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.232
You mouthed to me,
"Come here, Johnny."

10:01.234 --> 10:03.935
Then you tried to do a little
wink, but you can't wink.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.904
Remember that, Dana?
You can't wink!

10:05.906 --> 10:09.074
Then you blew me a little kiss.
So you saying you didn't see me?

10:09.076 --> 10:10.342
You saying you didn't see me?

10:10.344 --> 10:12.310
I think I have some drugs
in my pocket.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.112
You should search me, Johnny.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.249
Dana... what the hell
is wrong with you?

10:18.251 --> 10:20.018
Are you trying to go to jail?

10:20.020 --> 10:22.220
Only if you'll be the one
to handcuff me.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.826
Get out the damn car.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.366
Why the fuck
did this asshole run?

10:34.368 --> 10:36.968
Beats me.
I don't know why he ran.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.337
Oh, hey! Come on!
Give us a break!

10:39.339 --> 10:41.906
I'm just writing
a fucking ticket!

10:48.915 --> 10:51.683
Damn!
Now, that nigga is fast.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.818
Yo, ain't that Black?
Ain't he a O.G.?

10:53.820 --> 10:56.721
Yeah, but that nigga run
more like a young nigga.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.023
Five dollars
they ain't gonna catch him.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.290
You don't even have $5.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.265
- Like I was saying, ain't no --
- You ain't s--

11:07.267 --> 11:09.000
Aw, damn!

11:09.002 --> 11:11.403
Ooh! Damn!
Hold on, baby.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.405
Let me holler at you real quick.
Damn, girl.

11:13.407 --> 11:16.241
You looking so fine, make
a nigga touch hisself, girl.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.442
- Mm!
- Oh, yeah?

11:17.444 --> 11:18.743
Thank you.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.245
Mm.
What can I do for you?

11:20.247 --> 11:21.446
You like kids?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.048
- Do I like kids?
- Huh?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.783
- I love kids.
- Yeah? Oh, do you?

11:24.785 --> 11:26.151
What, you need a new baby daddy?

11:26.153 --> 11:28.420
- I might.
- I'll be your baby daddy.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.922
Little sweet little --
Damn. That's a big-ass baby.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.390
Who the daddy, Shaq?

11:32.392 --> 11:34.325
I ain't no motherfuckin' baby.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.094
Oh, shit.
This baby got a gun.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.981
Spread your damn legs, woman.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.016
All right.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.219
Got me doing this.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.755
Hands up behind your head, okay?

12:03.757 --> 12:04.856
- Mm.
- That's what you want?

12:04.858 --> 12:06.257
Yes.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.996
Ma'am, no recording, please.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.467
See what you -- See what you
got me looking like out here?

12:19.506 --> 12:22.974
You are obviously clean, okay?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.175
Go home, Dana.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.479
- Ever s--
- Go home, Dana.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.748
Every hero needs a sidekick.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.924
Yes. We got a 211
at the warehouse district.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.360
Got to make a stop.
Meet up in 20.

12:55.509 --> 12:57.342
Get out the way, man.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.945
Now, listen.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.548
Whether you like it or not,
it's true, okay?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.550
You only move up
in this line of work

13:05.552 --> 13:08.553
if you're the best
or if you have tits.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.256
You know that's chauvinistic,
right?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.291
Clearly you skipped
sensitivity training.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.060
Oh, come on, Diaz.
Get out of your feelings.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.829
I'm just keeping it real
with you.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.264
Now, listen.
I may be young.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.299
But people respect me
because I'm persistent,

13:21.301 --> 13:24.302
I'm a go-getter,
and I'm always honest.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.437
Sit back.
Enjoy the show.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.173
Take notes, baby.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.580
They said I got a baby --
a Mexican baby --

13:35.582 --> 13:37.115
on the loose,
stealing some shit.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.250
A fuckin' --
I'm here for a fucking baby!

13:39.252 --> 13:43.021
My nigga cheating on me,
and I'm here for a fuckin' baby?

13:43.023 --> 13:45.156
And the baby not even black?
I don't believe this shit.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.825
All right. All right.
How you doing?

13:46.827 --> 13:49.194
Whoa, whoa. Sir, sir, sir.
Man, slow your roll down.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.962
This is an active crime scene.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.031
You don't see the yellow tape?

13:53.033 --> 13:55.099
- I got work to --
- Hey, no. Ain't no work.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.901
These for-real police officers.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.903
I need you to bust a U.

13:58.905 --> 14:02.874
Take them skinny jeans and
that small shirt and whoo-whoo!

14:02.876 --> 14:04.375
- Bust a U?
- Bust a U!

14:04.377 --> 14:06.044
Hey, bro.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.579
I don't know if you think
I'm playing.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.415
Officer Hilson!
Officer Schwartz!

14:10.417 --> 14:12.083
Man, y'all come right on in.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.586
Man, it's good to see you.
Boy, look at you!

14:14.588 --> 14:16.154
- Looking like Brad Pitt.
- You have a good --

14:16.156 --> 14:18.489
Hey, bro! Bro!
You trying to sneak through?

14:18.491 --> 14:20.258
I'm'a tell you right now.

14:20.260 --> 14:24.162
You need to fall back...
like your hairline is doing.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.897
Keisha!

14:25.899 --> 14:28.032
Tell that bitch
I will snatch that frontal

14:28.034 --> 14:29.868
right off her ashy-ass head.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.336
And yes,
I'm always strapped, bitch!

14:31.338 --> 14:32.937
- Keisha!
- What?

14:32.939 --> 14:34.572
You know him?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.374
Bitch -- Oh, hey. Yeah, yeah.
They my peoples. They good.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.309
- Have a good one.
- Unh-unh, unh-unh, unh-unh.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.612
Not him, her.
Sheila, you good.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.147
Ha. Step back, bro.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.616
Step back.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.951
Hey, how you doing, ma'am?
No disrespect.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.519
Is he with you?

14:48.521 --> 14:50.455
Unfortunately.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.156
Must be the tits.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.025
Unfortunately.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.227
I was -- I was packing my boxes,
right, and I saw this girl.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.395
I was like, "Whoo!"

14:57.397 --> 14:58.930
Shut the fuck up

14:58.932 --> 15:00.164
and listen to me
and say something right now.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.166
- Go ahead.
- She had a fat-ass booty, right?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.902
How fat was her ass?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.137
- It was like that.
- Like this or like that?

15:06.139 --> 15:07.138
Both of them.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.973
Don't be a bitch.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.009
- What's the color of her hair?
- Red.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.211
- Red hair, fat ass?
- Red hair, fat ass.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.681
A grown baby with a mother
with a fat ass and the red hair?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.416
Let me see your ID,
you punk-bitch nigga.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.651
You trying to trick me.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.619
- Look, who did it?
- What the fuck?

15:21.621 --> 15:23.454
Give me a description
or something.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.456
And why the fuck your hands
behind your back already?

15:25.458 --> 15:26.691
I already know how it go

15:26.693 --> 15:28.559
when you fucking
with the police, man,

15:28.561 --> 15:30.228
and I already told y'all
who did it.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.930
Who did it?!

15:31.932 --> 15:36.634
Man, it was a baby,
a badass bitch, and his mama.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.203
Oh, you want to play today?

15:39.205 --> 15:41.072
Are you the baby's father?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.074
- I'm not the baby's --
- Don't be a bitch, okay?

15:43.076 --> 15:46.311
USS gonna stand for
"You stupid son of a bitch" --

15:46.313 --> 15:49.347
it's missing a B --
if you keep fucking with me.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.516
Don't talk to me like that.

15:52.018 --> 15:54.285
There's nobody watching, right?
Shut up.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.954
Don't cry like a bitch.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.656
Listen. We been tracking
those guys for a few months.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.992
If you remember anything
about them, let me know.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.093
That'd help us out.

16:02.095 --> 16:05.530
Hell no, man.
I ain't saying shit to the cops.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.465
Mm.
Ahh.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.035
See, I was having a good day
before all this shit

16:11.037 --> 16:13.071
and Uncle Tom over there.

16:13.073 --> 16:17.308
Now, unfortunately, I'm --
I'm wondering, you know, why --

16:17.310 --> 16:20.144
why these criminals,
who usually leave no witnesses,

16:20.146 --> 16:21.713
left y'all two alive.

16:21.715 --> 16:26.017
See, now I'm thinking
y'all may be an accessory.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.245
That's how I met them
three bad bitches right there!

18:34.247 --> 18:36.180
I got five million followers
on the Gram.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.883
I'm lit!
I'm Instagram famous.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.619
Let me see this shit, man.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.121
Man, look, look.
Check this out.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.323
- Hello?
- Let me see that again.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.457
Yeah, Doc.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.595
What? No, no, no, no.
Send him --

18:50.597 --> 18:52.163
Just send everything over.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.298
I'll get all the information
when you send it.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.533
All right.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.268
You all right, big dawg?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.637
- Yeah, man. You know.
- Doctor? You sick?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.606
My baby mama been
stressing me out, man.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.541
I can't -- can't get my shit up.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.312
Oh!
Pop got E.D.!

19:08.314 --> 19:09.780
Look here, man with titties.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.650
This between us, not you.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.685
Why you got to go there, Pop?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.822
Let's go by Big Mo
and get them roll-up.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.592
Thank you, Ms. Dubois.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.495
Stop by tomorrow at sunset for
a lovely kale-berry salad, okay?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.763
You be safe, all right?

19:25.765 --> 19:27.465
Tell your sister I say hello.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.569
Oh, damn, Mo.
What kind of operation is this?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.171
Your ass don't even eat kale.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.606
Nobody buying pickled pig ass
no more, man.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.708
I got to diversify here.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.477
Hold up, man.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.915
Come on, man.
What y'all coming around here?

19:43.917 --> 19:45.917
We got to hold it down, man.
What's up?

19:45.919 --> 19:47.818
Man, if you don't get your
Peter the Pirate-looking ass

19:47.820 --> 19:49.520
back on there and give me
the goddamn roll-up...

19:49.522 --> 19:51.689
Man, look. Forgive Blue.
What's up, Big Mo?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.424
What's happenin' with you,
Black?

19:53.426 --> 19:54.825
Good seeing you, homey.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.827
I understand
what diversification is,

19:56.829 --> 19:58.563
and I see what you're doing
here.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.631
I'd like to talk with you later
about some business.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.832
Let's do it.
Let's chop it up.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.401
- All right.
- I'm here.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.635
- All right.
- You know where my office is.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.237
Young Jeezy-looking
motherfucker.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.539
Blue, you know you still owe me
that money, man.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.740
I thought I paid you.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.509
I know where your baby mama
stay at.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.878
I'll pull up.
Believe that.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.447
Hey, Tom!
What's going on, man?

20:16.449 --> 20:19.217
Come on in. Yeah, come on in.
I got your latte.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.819
Listen up. Listen up.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.688
Hey, hey, hey.

20:23.690 --> 20:27.291
Now, if any of you do not know
who Pablo Vargas is...

20:28.761 --> 20:30.795
...well, you can bring up
your badges right now.

20:30.797 --> 20:34.432
We have a good shot
at bringing this asshole in.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.801
Lieutenant Moore.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.739
All right.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.980
Our intel is showing us
that Pablo has a new front.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.648
It's a cellphone store.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.751
And as of yesterday
at approximately 4:00 p.m.,

20:53.753 --> 20:58.489
armed robbers stole $300,000
worth of Enfinity phones

20:58.491 --> 21:00.491
from the Westville docks.

21:00.493 --> 21:03.861
It is anticipated that they will
take those phones from his store

21:03.863 --> 21:06.931
and move them to the streets.

21:07.433 --> 21:12.870
Jose Vargas, aka Kokaine,
is Pablo's nephew.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.006
He runs the store,
but he's more interested

21:15.008 --> 21:17.675
in his rap career
than the business.

21:17.677 --> 21:21.045
So it shouldn't be hard
to infiltrate his establishment.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.828
I didn't request any gangsters
for this setup.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.331
This is supposed to be all T&A.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.666
You're killing my creative vibe.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.568

22:20.106 --> 22:23.374

Huh?

22:23.376 --> 22:26.711
Everyone get the hell
out of here!

22:26.713 --> 22:31.082
I got to do business
with my nephew... the rapper.

22:31.684 --> 22:35.086
Dre, Tito, check the back.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.054
I got you, boss.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.924
You use my car?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.926
My fucking car.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.462
- That's my favorite car.
- Video, man.

22:44.464 --> 22:48.366
You let bitches put fingerprints
on <i> my</i> car.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.534
Man, that's for the video,
Unc, bro.

22:50.536 --> 22:51.902
<i>Yo no te</i> fucking <i> entiendo.</i>

22:54.941 --> 22:56.574
I swear to God,

22:56.576 --> 22:58.609
if your father didn't take
a fucking bullet for me,

22:58.611 --> 23:00.711
you'd be doing a music video
in a fucking wooden box.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.446
- You hear me?
- But he did, and look at us.

23:02.448 --> 23:03.981
We here now.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.783
Come on, Unc, man.
You know I love you, bro.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.151
- What's up?
- We're good, boss.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.853
- Everything's there.
- I'm telling you, man.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.688
- We good, Unc. I got this.
<i>- Tienes suerte.</i>

23:10.690 --> 23:12.990
You're fucking lucky.
Let me tell you something.

23:12.992 --> 23:16.060
I got a shipment coming in
this week, all right?

23:16.062 --> 23:18.662
I need you to put some of
the Enfinity phones on the side

23:18.664 --> 23:20.564
so we can cloak the package,
all right?

23:20.566 --> 23:22.666
Sell the rest.
Can you handle that?

23:22.668 --> 23:24.435
I got you.

23:24.437 --> 23:28.839
And take my fucking car
back to my house and wash it.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.675
I got you. I'm'a wax it.
I'm -- I got you, Unc. We good.

23:31.677 --> 23:32.977
Come on, man.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.112
They got some good drinks
in here.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.782
Can I interest you
in our special -- a cafe latte

23:37.784 --> 23:40.618
with two shots of espresso
and an orange-peel twist?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.686
Yeah.
I'll take one of those.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.422
And what can I get for you, sir?

23:44.424 --> 23:48.993
I'll take a double shot
of Hennessy and two white women.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.463
I don't think
that's on our menu.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.899
Well, can you put it on there?
I see it.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.033
Two white w-- Hey.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.968
Can you chill out?

23:58.638 --> 23:59.703
Man, what --

23:59.705 --> 24:01.739
O-Okay.
I'm'a chill out.

24:01.741 --> 24:02.973
Just give him what I got.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.542
You're gonna like it.
I'm telling you.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.143
That sound like
it's gonna make me shit.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.045
You know what, Blue?

24:08.047 --> 24:10.114
Nigga, you never gonna change.

24:10.116 --> 24:13.083
Uh, nigga,
I change if you change.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.786
Sir, can you not say that word?

24:15.788 --> 24:21.192
It's ugly and hurtful...
to everyone.

24:21.194 --> 24:26.564
It brings so... much... pain.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.769
You know what?
She right.

24:33.673 --> 24:34.939
Nigga, please.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.007
Let me holler at my son, bro.

24:39.212 --> 24:40.744
What's up, boy?

24:40.746 --> 24:42.546
- What up, Pops?
- What's up, Cash?

24:42.548 --> 24:44.215
- What's happening, son?
- I'm just checking in.

24:44.217 --> 24:45.683
How's the fam doing?

24:45.685 --> 24:47.585
Blessed.
What's good, son?

24:47.587 --> 24:49.487
You created a new Facebook yet?

24:49.489 --> 24:51.088
No, but I did break
all the school records

24:51.090 --> 24:52.690
with my mock dating app.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.158
I just wish they'd let me
push it up here for real.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.760
- You know how that go, though.
- Don't trip, son.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.229
When you graduate,
you're gonna have plenty of time

24:58.231 --> 24:59.697
to start your own company.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.500
Hey!
What's up?!

25:02.835 --> 25:05.636
- I'm trying to get some coffee.
- I'm'a hit you right back, son.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.238
All right, Pops.
I'm'a holler at you.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.573
Yo, Trish, come on. Hurry up.

25:09.575 --> 25:12.710
Man, shut your ass up.
Hey. Hey! Back up!

25:12.712 --> 25:14.645
Man, back up!

25:18.251 --> 25:20.951
Ooh.

25:20.953 --> 25:24.088
Ah.
Whoo!

25:25.825 --> 25:27.725
Peter, what's up?

25:27.727 --> 25:29.293
Are you trying to smoke all day
or trying to make some money?

25:29.295 --> 25:31.729
I'm with it.
What do you got for me?

25:31.731 --> 25:35.833
I got a code-11 perv in so deep,
we can't reinstall his iOS.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.601
- What you got?
- You need my silver package.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.870
Resets the iOS,
which allows the virus

25:39.872 --> 25:42.773
without deleting pertinent
updates and data-safety system.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.943
Boom.
That'll be 50 bucks.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.679
Prices keep getting higher, huh?

25:48.681 --> 25:50.714
Yeah.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.050
You got change?

25:53.052 --> 25:55.553
You supposed to give <i> me</i> change!

25:55.555 --> 25:57.621
- Oh. Hold up.
- Man.

25:57.623 --> 25:59.089
I got something.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.624
You about to lose a customer.

26:00.626 --> 26:01.992
No.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.261
There you go.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.865
- Killing your damn brain cells.
- Hey, Trish.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.934
Remember, weed helps
with anxiety.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.703
It's good for you.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.043
Where do you find out
about these places?

26:19.045 --> 26:22.279
Man, I'm telling you.
They know everything here.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.782
Welcome to the Psychic Beehive,

26:24.784 --> 26:28.319
where we grab your destiny
by the b--

26:28.854 --> 26:31.822
Oh.
It's y'all.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.891
Didn't nobody see y'all
come in here, did they?

26:33.893 --> 26:36.226
Because, you know, I can't be
charging these white boys $200

26:36.228 --> 26:37.962
if they see y'all
getting the hood hookup.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.730
Ain't nobody gonna be paying

26:39.732 --> 26:42.766
your fake-Beyoncé-looking ass
no $200

26:42.768 --> 26:44.902
for no goddamn
neighborhood hookup.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.904
Don't you be talking about
Beyoncé, Blue.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.138
- That's right.
- And don't you come up in here

26:48.140 --> 26:49.807
starting up with my sister
either.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.642
- That's right.
- Hey, Black.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.778
Hey, I'm talking to both of you
flying-monkey bitches.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.180
- Monkey?!
- And, Ms. Cleo,

26:56.182 --> 26:57.881
I hope this shit work!

26:57.883 --> 27:00.250
It do work, nigga.
This real.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.853
- I got the gift, nigga.
- She got the gift, nigga.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.222
Calm down, man.
I heard she really good at this.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.057
Ooh. Not as good
as you are, Black.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.659
And I knew
you was gonna say that.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.961
- You the best, baby.
- 'Cause I got the gift.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.364
Mm. She does have the gift,
but I got a gift, too.

27:13.366 --> 27:15.899
That's right. Makes a lot
of money off of that.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.769
- What the hell is that smell?
- A psychic and selling pussy.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.170
- We're working hard here.
- Your upper lip.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.072
Mm.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.641
I feel something.
Feel something.

27:23.643 --> 27:24.375
- Bzzt?
- Bzzt!

27:24.377 --> 27:25.643
- Bzzt.
- Bzzt!

27:25.645 --> 27:27.811
- Bzzt! Bzzt!
- Bzzt! Bzzt!

27:27.813 --> 27:29.380
- I feel something about you.
- Ooh.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.749
- I feel something.
- You feel something?

27:31.751 --> 27:33.317
- I feel something. Come closer.
- Come closer.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.319
Come closer.

27:35.921 --> 27:38.789
- I feel that when you talk...
- Mm.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.691
- ...your breath...
- Mm.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.760
- ...smells like baby diapers...
- Ooh.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.195
- ...vomit...
- Ooh.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.430
- ...dookie chunks...
- Oh!

27:46.432 --> 27:47.998
- ...and hot-dog water!

33:17.029 --> 33:18.261

- We're not.

33:18.263 --> 33:21.031
Mr. Black,
take a look around you.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.166
The neighborhood is changing.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.669
You could take the money
and cash in

33:25.671 --> 33:28.271
and spend your dividends --

33:28.273 --> 33:31.341
not to mention, uh,
that state record

33:31.343 --> 33:35.078
that, uh, says you're way
overdue on your property taxes.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.646
Well, I'm telling you.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.549
I know I'm not overdue,
'cause Blue took care of that.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.118
Ain't we straight, Blue?

33:41.120 --> 33:42.686
Blue!

33:42.688 --> 33:46.223
Well, anyway,
I understand gentrification,

33:46.225 --> 33:48.358
and I understand
beautifying the neighborhood.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.794
But there's a lot of people
that come from this neighborhood

33:50.796 --> 33:53.430
that love our business,
and it's about them.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.632
So y'all have a nice day.
We're not for sale.

33:55.634 --> 33:59.236
And, Blue, bring your ass here!

34:05.411 --> 34:07.344
- I'm looking at that ass.
- But let me tell you something.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.646
To be straight up, man,
we ain't getting no younger.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.081
We got kids.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.181
We got to take care
of our business.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.449
This is about ownership.

34:13.452 --> 34:14.717
These people want to buy
Big Poppa's

34:14.719 --> 34:16.485
'cause they understand
what it is.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.121
So you didn't see that ass
just walk by?

34:18.123 --> 34:20.123
Man, I'm not worrying
about no ass, man.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.492
I'm trying to get some money
and take care of our business.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.661
I want to be able to leave
something for my kids.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.830
Big Poppa's is all we got.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.665
I don't know about you,
but I'm for real.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.699
We could have had that ass.

34:36.275 --> 34:41.311
I'll have a hamburger --
cheese, lettuce, tomatoes,

34:41.313 --> 34:42.779
and mayonnaise.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.514

34:44.516 --> 34:47.451

34:47.453 --> 34:48.618
Oh, okay.
Here you go.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.605
- Why? I get a family discount.
- What?

35:08.607 --> 35:11.341
You need to shut your ass up

Shit. You got to learn
how to bless your damn people.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.395
I was up the street,

35:32.397 --> 35:34.164

on the corner.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.565
She got the motorbikes.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.167
I'm trying to get two of them,

Of course, I'm gonna have to
check your credit first, okay?

35:56.488 --> 35:57.821

35:59.691 --> 36:02.325
Okay.

36:10.669 --> 36:14.571
I can't believe you run
a restaurant <i> and</i> fix credit.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.640
I pretty much just run
the day-to-day.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.508
My son is the real genius.

36:18.510 --> 36:22.512
He acquired this program that
takes credit from dead people.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.247
Giving our people
a second chance.

36:24.249 --> 36:26.249
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

36:26.251 --> 36:29.486
It's not illegal.
Dead people can't use credit.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.689
And besides, we've been
getting messed over for years.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.691
Just consider me Robin Hood...

36:34.693 --> 36:35.859
- Okay.
- ...with a computer.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.461
All right.
You just be careful.

36:38.463 --> 36:40.363
Things are starting to get good
between us,

36:40.365 --> 36:42.599
and I don't want to have to
visit you in jail.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.201
I ain't never going back.

36:46.238 --> 36:49.406
My sauce is the shit!

36:54.713 --> 36:57.681
That's right. Even <i> eses</i> think
my sauce is the shit.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.619
Hey. Hey.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.487
Uh-huh.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.756
Um, I know I ain't got to be
the smartest dude in the world,

37:06.758 --> 37:08.491
but did you say something
about stealing my car?

37:08.493 --> 37:10.260
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

37:10.262 --> 37:11.561
All right.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.000
Right. Now, that --
That's more like it.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.602
That's more like it.

37:23.308 --> 37:25.408
Oh, no, no, no.
I understand that shit.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.509
What'd you say?

37:26.511 --> 37:29.813
Uh, everything, uh, good.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.481
- Oh, okay. Okay.
- Good.

37:31.483 --> 37:34.584
Hey, don't get on that
ass-whoopin' Mr. Blue guy.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.024
Yeah. Right.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.861
- What's going on, love?
- Hey, baby.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.964
Um, I want you to see this
right here.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.599
What?

37:55.007 --> 37:56.473
Man, what's funny?

37:56.475 --> 37:57.741
Y'all gonna fix my credit
or what, man?

37:57.743 --> 37:59.542
Hold on.

37:59.544 --> 38:03.913
Sir, it seems as though, uh,
your FICO credit score is a 211.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.348
Oh, my Lord.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.350
At the liquor store,
I done a 211?

38:07.352 --> 38:09.653
Man, I don't rob people.
You trippin'.

38:09.655 --> 38:13.456
No, brother.
Your credit score is a 211.

38:13.458 --> 38:16.493
You're gonna need Jesus Christ
to help fix this credit score.

38:16.495 --> 38:19.596
If you see a sign somewhere say
"Jesus Christ fix credit,"

38:19.598 --> 38:20.930
you go there.

38:20.932 --> 38:23.300
I come to pick up an order.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.770
Wasn't you just here?

38:26.772 --> 38:29.773
I said I come to pick up
an order for Eric.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.811
Eric, Erica --
I don't give a fuck who you are.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.380
I want the motherfucker
that's paying.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.849
Eric, that's him.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.685
Want to talk to me stupid.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.920
No, this nigga didn't do that.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.622
Boy, you serious?

38:45.624 --> 38:47.390
You handle my sister
like a what?

38:47.392 --> 38:50.093
With your sausage head.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.796
What, you thought
I wasn't gonna tell him?

38:52.798 --> 38:55.098
Erica, shut up.
We're in a --

38:55.100 --> 38:58.435
Eric, somewhere
we never been -- California.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.838
Eric, Erica is cool.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.441
But Eric need to drink
some lotion.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.844
Oh, baby, you gots to go home.

39:14.419 --> 39:15.752
What?

39:15.754 --> 39:16.953
What's happenin'?

39:16.955 --> 39:18.955
Why you all in my face
like that?

39:18.957 --> 39:20.890
Who the fuck is this nigga?

39:20.892 --> 39:24.027
Who?
What are you talking about?

39:24.029 --> 39:25.595
Don't try to play me.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.664
I seen the nigga
who the fuck you came in with.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.966
Boy, I'm not with nobody.
What is you talking about?

39:29.968 --> 39:31.668
I'm not with nobody.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.737
See, there you go,

39:33.739 --> 39:36.106

39:36.108 --> 39:37.607
You know I love you, right?

39:38.910 --> 39:40.610
Why you ain't take
your medicine?

39:40.612 --> 39:42.011
- What medicine?
- Come on. Let's go home.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.047
- Let me take you --
- You my medicine.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.548
You my medicine.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.763

39:59.765 --> 40:01.598
- Yeah. I like that shit.
- This is the only hair I got.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.099
- I'm the heart of the streets.
- That's all you need, baby.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.402
- Bald head. I ain't scared.
- I like that shit.

40:05.404 --> 40:08.505
Oh, me too. I do like that shit.
You heard me?

40:08.507 --> 40:10.507
Travis, are you kidding me?
I'm standing right here.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.509
- I know. There go God.
- Travis, watch your fucking m--

40:12.511 --> 40:13.977
There go God.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.945
- I know. Look at that.
- Yeah. She <i> is</i> fine.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.747
She's so fine,
she'll make a nigga find a job,

40:17.749 --> 40:19.048
and he don't even have none.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.650
What the fuck you looking at,
nigga?!

40:20.652 --> 40:22.118
- Disrespectful ass!
- Ooh! Got me fucked up!

40:22.120 --> 40:24.053
Man, you got me fucked up
out here, man!

40:24.055 --> 40:25.655
You got me fucked --
I'm gonna sit --

40:25.657 --> 40:27.690
Man, you a ho out here, bitch,

40:27.692 --> 40:29.125
I'll bat y'all in your mouth,

40:29.127 --> 40:31.161
and your mama got
her dollar store towels,

40:31.163 --> 40:32.929
and you're a dirty fox,
with your dirt ass.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.030
I'm about to call my sister.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.005
Can I go right now, boss?

40:42.007 --> 40:43.807
Man, if you don't clean
these goddamn tables,

40:43.809 --> 40:45.442
I'm gonna fire your ass.

40:45.444 --> 40:47.911
I'm looking for who's in charge
of credit repair.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.680
That would be me.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.582
- Man! If you don't stop --
- God.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.117
Get your ass back there
on them fryers.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.151
Shit.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.853
Damn, Pop.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.191
Mm-mm-mm.

41:01.893 --> 41:05.161
I'd shoot my daddy
if you just take one out.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.530
Listen, is Black available?

41:07.532 --> 41:08.932
Black!

41:08.934 --> 41:11.601
Blue, stop screaming my name.
This a business.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.136
You got a customer here
to see you.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.638
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.906
My name is Ms. Peaches.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.141
How can I help you?

41:18.143 --> 41:19.709
I actually have good credit.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.511
I'm just looking to add
a few trade lines.

41:21.513 --> 41:22.846
You think that's something
you can help me with?

41:22.848 --> 41:24.514
I can help you with anything.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.616
I mean, come on.
Step into my office.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.585
You ain't got no office.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.654
Charletta, I need you to put
two trade lines

41:31.656 --> 41:32.889
on this lady's credit.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.225
Why?

41:35.227 --> 41:37.126
'Cause that's
what I pay your ass for.

41:37.696 --> 41:41.731
Actually, I was hoping if --
if maybe you can help me.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.267
- Come on. I'll help you.
- Oh. Unh-unh. No. No, sir.

41:44.269 --> 41:48.505
You are not about to cut into my
commission with your cheap ass.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.640
You know I got kids to feed.
Don't do me like that.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.876
And your ass will be all stingy
with your little take-home food.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.777
I got her.
Come on. I got you. Mm-hmm.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.813
You can go have a seat,
whatever your name is.

41:56.815 --> 41:58.681
- Take care of her, please.
- Mm-hmm.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.583
- All right?
- Yeah. Mm.

42:00.585 --> 42:02.752
Or you gonna be looking
for a job.

42:05.991 --> 42:08.958
You do realize I need to run
your credit first, right?

42:08.960 --> 42:10.760
Isn't that why I'm here?

42:10.762 --> 42:14.030
We don't take EBT funds
as credit, just to let you know.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.733
I have good credit.
I just need the trade lines.

42:16.735 --> 42:19.002
Well, you know,
that's what they all say.

42:19.004 --> 42:21.004
Uh, what is your full name?

42:21.006 --> 42:23.540
Paula Peaches Escobar.

42:23.542 --> 42:26.843
Mm.
And your mama named you Peaches?

42:26.845 --> 42:29.846
You know, she should've named
you Chiquita Fuckin' Banana.

42:42.694 --> 42:44.561
Oops. Sorry.
I can't help you.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.062
And why is that?

42:46.064 --> 42:49.032
Well, they only allow two
trade lines per year for hoes --

42:49.034 --> 42:51.067
I mean for customers --

42:51.069 --> 42:54.904
and it seems that you've,
uh, exceeded that by 10.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.074
Yeah.
Can't do nothing for you.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.342
Sorry.

42:59.344 --> 43:01.244
You don't want to do nothing
for me

43:01.246 --> 43:04.948
'cause you know I'm the one
who took your man.

43:04.950 --> 43:07.584
You know what?
Let me explain something to you.

43:07.586 --> 43:09.085
I know your baby daddy, ho,

43:09.087 --> 43:10.887
and he done already told me
about your ass

43:10.889 --> 43:12.922
and all the little slick
side shit

43:12.924 --> 43:14.657
that your raggedy ass be on.

43:14.659 --> 43:17.660
But I'm'a tell you like this --
If you're thinking

43:17.662 --> 43:19.796
that you're about to come up
in <i> this</i> motherfucker

43:19.798 --> 43:22.699
and scare me, bitch,
it ain't gonna happen.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.704
Blue, why the hell
ain't you call me?

43:27.706 --> 43:30.740
I didn't know you can get
phone calls in prison.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.942
Nigga, I'm home now,
and I paid you to fix my credit.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.344
The shit's still fucked up.

43:34.346 --> 43:36.613
Got denied eight times
trying to get a new whip.

43:36.615 --> 43:38.915
Nigga, you got seven repos.

43:38.917 --> 43:40.883
What the fuck I supposed to do
with that?

43:40.885 --> 43:42.218
Not my problem.

43:42.220 --> 43:43.920
You shouldn't have took
my money, then.

43:43.922 --> 43:46.356
You fuck with my money,
I'm'a fuck you up.

43:46.358 --> 43:48.291
Nigga, please.

43:50.629 --> 43:52.295
Hey, yo! Get your hand
off my pops, nigga!

43:52.297 --> 43:55.832
Whoo! Son, I have never been
so happy to see your fat ass.

43:55.834 --> 43:57.634
- Shut up, Pops!
- Okay.

43:57.636 --> 43:59.969
- We got a problem?
- Come on. Fair fight.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.038
Now I'm charging interest.

44:03.041 --> 44:05.842
You're just mad I took your man
<i>and</i> your commission, bitch.

44:05.844 --> 44:07.844
Bitch.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.858
Pop!
Pop!

44:21.860 --> 44:23.126
Pop, you good?!

44:23.128 --> 44:24.694
Sir, do you know who shot you?

44:24.696 --> 44:27.363
Yeah. Some Eazy-E-
looking motherfucker.

44:32.804 --> 44:35.271
Mr. Black.

44:35.273 --> 44:37.707
Uh, Walter Jones, city official.

44:38.109 --> 44:41.277
I'm sorry.
You didn't make it.

44:41.946 --> 44:43.980
Good man.

44:45.950 --> 44:48.084
Uncle Black, what'd they say?

44:48.787 --> 44:51.020
He's shutting us down.

44:51.022 --> 44:52.922
- Damn!
- We didn't make code.

44:54.426 --> 44:58.294
But don't tell your pops,
all right?

45:01.266 --> 45:04.067
So, h-how is it that you
pronounce your name again?

45:04.069 --> 45:06.803
Is it -- Is it Cashmere, like --
like my wife's sweater,

45:06.805 --> 45:08.237
or is Cash-mere.

45:08.239 --> 45:11.007
Oh, it's like
Cashmere, like Cash.

45:12.944 --> 45:15.878
You know, son, I'm --
I'm really trying to like you,

45:15.880 --> 45:16.979
but I'm not there yet.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.281
I-I'm sorry.

45:18.283 --> 45:21.417
I have to shut
this whole thing down.

45:21.419 --> 45:23.453
But, sir, I was only trying
to provide a service

45:23.455 --> 45:25.288
for the student body.

45:25.290 --> 45:28.491
I mean, I invented a system
that increased the overall --

45:28.493 --> 45:30.193
Uh, M-Mr. Miller,

45:30.195 --> 45:34.063
I-I'm an avid supporter
of technological advances,

45:34.065 --> 45:37.433
but not at the expense
of compromising the law.

45:38.236 --> 45:41.070
Man, this shit fucked up, B.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.306
I can't let Big Poppa's
get shut down, man.

45:43.308 --> 45:45.374
I mean, Fat, what the hell
we supposed to do, man?

45:45.376 --> 45:46.776
Huh?
Rob a bank?

45:46.778 --> 45:48.277
That shit just got to get
shut down.

45:48.279 --> 45:49.812
That is what it is.

45:49.814 --> 45:51.347
He should've stayed his ass
in school.

45:51.349 --> 45:53.249
But what I'm telling you
what you need to do is

45:53.251 --> 45:56.219
get your views up on that Gram
so we can monetize that shit.

45:56.221 --> 45:58.821
How?
Look at this busted-ass screen!

45:58.823 --> 46:01.791
I need the store
and get the new Enfinity, man.

46:01.793 --> 46:03.059
That's what I need to do.

46:03.061 --> 46:04.794
You <i> know</i> them phones is hard.

46:04.796 --> 46:06.963
How the hell you even know
they got 'em? Huh?

46:06.965 --> 46:08.364
Man, 'cause look.

46:08.366 --> 46:12.835
Niggas only sleep in line
for shoes, not phones.

46:12.837 --> 46:14.270
Ain't nothing wrong
with that phone.

46:14.272 --> 46:15.838

49:45.149 --> 49:46.649
We can get these phones
to Uncle Black,

49:46.651 --> 49:49.051
and he could sell them
to save his restaurant, man.

49:49.053 --> 49:51.153

- There we go.

49:51.155 --> 49:52.621
And we could sell the dope, man.

49:52.623 --> 49:53.756
Nah. No!

49:53.758 --> 49:55.558
No, nigga.
No! No!

49:55.560 --> 49:57.326
You don't care
about your family.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.761
You don't give a damn
about Uncle Black.

49:58.763 --> 50:00.563

50:00.565 --> 50:04.133

Don't worry about that.

50:54.318 --> 50:55.618
Let's go!

50:57.722 --> 50:59.388
Nigga, you ordered a Line?

50:59.390 --> 51:01.357

52:25.276 --> 52:26.542

52:26.544 --> 52:27.743
Exactly.

52:27.745 --> 52:29.645
It's time to get this money,
man.

52:29.647 --> 52:31.780
Okay?
I'm done robbing niggas.

52:31.782 --> 52:33.616
I'm done kidnapping niggas.

52:33.618 --> 52:35.885

That's it.

52:43.461 --> 52:45.361
Look.

52:45.363 --> 52:47.630
How the fuck you gonna turn on
the phones?

52:47.632 --> 52:49.632
And the serial numbers
might get flagged.

52:49.634 --> 52:51.834
We got to turn them on first.

52:51.836 --> 52:54.370
Ooh. Somebody getting smart
all of a sudden.

52:54.372 --> 52:57.339
Okay. I don't mean to interrupt.
Uh, my app is -- is --

52:57.341 --> 52:59.275

52:59.277 --> 53:00.643
It's -- It's -- It's --
It's broke!

53:00.645 --> 53:02.378
The fuck wrong

53:02.380 --> 53:03.812
- It's not working.
- It's broke.

53:03.814 --> 53:05.881
- You don't got no app!
- Lisa, where you going?

53:05.883 --> 53:08.484
With us, stupid ass.
Sit your ass down.

53:08.486 --> 53:10.753
What the hell wrong with you?
Why you driving so goddamn slow?

53:10.755 --> 53:12.221
- You good?
- Drive the car.

53:12.223 --> 53:13.589
- Just a little nervous.
- Damn, man.

53:13.591 --> 53:15.791
Why you got
a steering wheel cover?

53:15.793 --> 53:17.660
- My hands get chafed sometimes.
- No, boy.

53:17.662 --> 53:19.395
You a freak.
You a freaky-ass boy.

53:19.397 --> 53:20.896
- You're freaky, boy.
- I'm a freaky boy.

53:20.898 --> 53:22.665
- I know how you is.
- I am. Yeah. I'm a freaky boy.

53:22.667 --> 53:24.800
I-I can tell, boy.
You got a steering wheel cover.

53:24.802 --> 53:26.468
- You need to stop that.
- Come on, baby.

53:27.838 --> 53:29.638
Wow.

53:30.208 --> 53:33.609
White women are crazy in porn.

53:34.312 --> 53:38.247
Is that a donkey
following a taxi cab?

53:38.249 --> 53:39.715
What?

53:39.717 --> 53:41.350
Aah!

53:43.287 --> 53:46.889
Je-- Lord, thank you!

53:46.891 --> 53:48.958
- It works again!
- Hello, Blue!

53:48.960 --> 53:51.894
How are we feeling today?

53:51.896 --> 53:54.897
Oh, improving I see.
What you looking at?

53:54.899 --> 53:58.500
Oh -- Blue, what did I tell you
about watching porn in here?

53:58.502 --> 54:00.336
You can't do this.
This is a hospital.

54:00.338 --> 54:02.371
Plus,
there's no need to watch porn

54:02.373 --> 54:03.772
when you got real women around

54:03.774 --> 54:06.375
with, you know, real titties
and real booties.

54:06.377 --> 54:08.877
You don't have to watch
fake titties and fake booties.

54:08.879 --> 54:10.613
Nurse!

54:10.615 --> 54:11.880
What are you calling
the nurses for?

54:11.882 --> 54:15.517
'Cause I don't want you ar--
Nurse!

54:15.519 --> 54:19.688
Why don't you, uh, go get me
a vial of that paralysis cream?

54:19.690 --> 54:21.257
We're gonna need that.

54:21.259 --> 54:22.825
- Paralysis cream?
- Mm-hmm.

54:22.827 --> 54:25.361
- For?
- Go get the cream!

54:25.363 --> 54:27.363
- Here we go again.
- Don't go.

54:27.365 --> 54:29.431
I'll give you $25 if you stay.

54:29.433 --> 54:32.968
You know, I told the doctor that
we would keep you very still

54:32.970 --> 54:36.305
so that you wouldn't hurt
anything important.

54:36.307 --> 54:37.506
What are you doing?

54:37.508 --> 54:40.476
I know you're gonna be
just fine.

54:40.478 --> 54:41.910
What are you doing?

54:41.912 --> 54:43.512
You're probably just stressing,

54:43.514 --> 54:46.048
because I heard that your
restaurant got shut down.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.985
- My restaurant got shut down?
- Oh, yes.

54:49.987 --> 54:51.520
How did my restaurant
get shut down?!

54:51.522 --> 54:53.756
I don't know,
but it's shut down.

54:53.758 --> 54:54.857
It's gone.

54:54.859 --> 54:56.392
Oh, shit!

54:58.462 --> 54:59.828
Get your big ass off me!

55:00.665 --> 55:02.364
Nurse!

55:03.868 --> 55:05.601
Is that ring real?

55:05.603 --> 55:07.970
You need to stay in
your motherfuckin' lane, baby.

55:07.972 --> 55:09.471
I don't come down to your job

55:09.473 --> 55:11.707
and fuck with your broom
and dustpan, do I?

55:11.709 --> 55:13.876
Mr. Tony Smooth.

55:13.878 --> 55:16.045
I told you before.
My name is not Tony.

55:16.047 --> 55:18.013
My name is Jackpot.

55:18.015 --> 55:21.684
Jackpot Jackson.
You understand?

55:21.686 --> 55:23.852
You ever go to the casino
and see them 7s light up

55:23.854 --> 55:25.821
all the way around
the motherfuckin' board

55:25.823 --> 55:27.956
and that thing go
"ding, ding, ding, ding, ding"?

55:27.958 --> 55:29.625
Jackpot, nigga!

55:29.627 --> 55:30.926
'Cause I get paid.

55:30.928 --> 55:33.329
Hey, bartender, give me a --

55:33.331 --> 55:35.631
give me a little cup
so he can give me a pee test.

55:35.633 --> 55:36.665
What?

55:36.667 --> 55:38.901
You want me to piss in a mug?

55:38.903 --> 55:40.803
That's exactly what I said.

55:40.805 --> 55:42.705
You're lucky I only got
five more days.

55:42.707 --> 55:44.373
- Then I'm done with you.
- You know what?

55:44.375 --> 55:47.076
Give me a reason to send
your fat black ass back to jail,

55:47.078 --> 55:49.044
you Crispy Critter-looking
motherfucker!

55:49.046 --> 55:50.713
You -- You sure he can't see me?

55:50.715 --> 55:52.514
No. Stop asking me.

55:52.516 --> 55:54.383
That look like some
regular-ass glass, though.

55:54.385 --> 55:56.652
You sure?

55:56.654 --> 55:59.555
He cannot see you.
Calm down.

55:59.557 --> 56:02.124
Can he hear me, though?
Can he hear me?

56:02.126 --> 56:04.893
I seen "Lord of the Rings."
Dwarfs got good hearing.

56:04.895 --> 56:06.128
- Calm down...
- That's -- Okay.

56:06.130 --> 56:08.597
...and identify the suspect.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.767
- Okay.
- Who is it?

56:12.603 --> 56:14.136
That one right there.

56:14.138 --> 56:16.839
The one that's four foot.
The dwarf in the middle.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.107
- That's him.
- Are you sure?

56:18.109 --> 56:19.775
Yeah. That's him for sure.

56:19.777 --> 56:22.444
When the big mama at, though?
Where she at?

56:22.446 --> 56:25.514
Can you give her my number
for -- for me?

56:25.516 --> 56:27.383
She was fine, though.
That's all I'm saying.

56:27.385 --> 56:29.651
I told you! You locked
the wrong motherfucker up!

56:29.653 --> 56:32.020
You got Train,
but you want Cuba.

56:32.022 --> 56:34.022
That's who you want.

56:35.760 --> 56:38.026
- Who the fuck is Cuba?
- You -- Cuba right --

56:38.028 --> 56:39.995
Hey, Cuba!
He wants you, Cuba!

56:39.997 --> 56:41.530
Do you know what?

56:41.532 --> 56:43.665
You know you got
the wrong person.

56:43.667 --> 56:47.403
You got Cu--
You got Train, but you want me.

56:47.405 --> 56:51.140
You got two people --
two people in here.

56:51.142 --> 56:53.142
Yo, Train!

56:53.144 --> 56:55.544
Tell him you got
the wrong people!

56:57.014 --> 56:59.581
Man, wake your ass up!

56:59.583 --> 57:03.986
Man, what the hell you doing
jacking off to a basketball

57:03.988 --> 57:05.988
with a mop head on top of it?

57:05.990 --> 57:08.123
Hey, you're in
my personal space, C.O.

57:08.125 --> 57:10.959
You got your feet outside,
you're smelling up this hallway,

57:10.961 --> 57:13.162
and I think your ass is in here
for tickets.

57:13.164 --> 57:15.030
So stop acting like a thug.

57:15.032 --> 57:16.732
Stop making this hard.
Keep walking.

57:16.734 --> 57:19.001
I don't know nothing.
I don't know anything.

57:19.003 --> 57:20.436
- I don't know nothing.
- Oh, you don't know nothing?

57:20.438 --> 57:21.503
We'll see how much
you don't know.

57:21.505 --> 57:22.738
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

57:22.740 --> 57:23.839
I'll bring him
into interrogation.

57:23.841 --> 57:25.908
This is my interrogation, okay?

57:25.910 --> 57:27.709
Frankly, I think
you're too close to this.

57:27.711 --> 57:29.077
You need to let Freeman
handle it.

57:29.079 --> 57:31.180
- He's here, and he's the best.
- Chill, man!

57:31.182 --> 57:33.615
I'm not too close to this case,
okay?

57:33.617 --> 57:35.884
Let Freeman handle this.

57:37.955 --> 57:42.524
Take him to Freeman in I2.

57:46.797 --> 57:48.597
What's taking so long?

57:48.599 --> 57:50.098
You got somewhere better to be?

57:50.100 --> 57:53.035
Yeah.
In there, getting answers.

57:53.037 --> 57:55.070
He's going about this all wrong.

57:55.072 --> 57:57.239
Rule number one --
Never judge a book by its cover.

57:57.241 --> 57:59.741
He's small, but he's a monster.

57:59.743 --> 58:01.543
Normal tactics won't work.

58:01.545 --> 58:03.512
Nobody's doubting you, Miller.

58:03.514 --> 58:06.014
Look, I brought Freeman in
myself.

58:06.016 --> 58:09.818
He has a 98% turnover rate,
and he keeps his cool.

58:10.120 --> 58:12.154
That Ewok doesn't have a chance.

58:12.890 --> 58:15.090
Where's Pablo?!

58:15.092 --> 58:16.792
Where's the stash?!
Huh?!

58:16.794 --> 58:18.126
What you looking at?!

58:18.128 --> 58:19.761
I know you hear me!

58:19.763 --> 58:22.798
Little-bitty baby ears.
You hear everything, huh?

58:22.800 --> 58:24.066
Huh?!

58:24.068 --> 58:26.535
I'll put your little ass
in San Quentin.

58:26.537 --> 58:29.605
- Say I won't!
- I hear they got cable.

58:35.212 --> 58:37.513
I've -- Not today.

58:40.618 --> 58:43.719
They beating the hell
out that baby up in there.

58:43.721 --> 58:46.021
Oh, hell no.

58:47.925 --> 58:49.691
Come here.

58:49.693 --> 58:51.159
Oh, God. Oh, God.

58:51.161 --> 58:52.628
Freeman, no!
Freeman, no!

58:52.630 --> 58:54.062
Come on, man!

58:59.570 --> 59:00.836
You were saying?

59:00.838 --> 59:03.805
I'm --
I'm gonna be in my office.

59:03.807 --> 59:05.073
I'm not going in there.

59:05.075 --> 59:06.842
I'm'a tell on my damn self.

59:06.844 --> 59:08.610
Shit.
I pimped them hoes.

59:08.612 --> 59:10.112
But shit, they knew
what they signed up for.

59:10.114 --> 59:12.014
I might know something
about that ho

59:12.016 --> 59:14.550
that popped up on the beach and
the ho y'all got off her feet.

59:14.552 --> 59:16.018
But shit.

59:16.020 --> 59:18.086
I was raised with full-blooded
rottweiler puppies

59:18.088 --> 59:20.122
that go "Rr-rr-rr-rr-rr!" every
time you try to touch them.

59:20.124 --> 59:21.823
And I'll tell the judge

59:21.825 --> 59:23.926
if you wasn't raised with
full-blooded rottweiler puppies,

59:23.928 --> 59:25.861
every time you try to
touch them, they go "Rr-rr" --

59:25.863 --> 59:27.062
Hey! Hold up.
Hold up.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.064
Hold on. Hold on.

59:31.135 --> 59:33.302
Let me see what you got.

59:41.011 --> 59:46.348
Last time Christmas came early
like this, it was 1998.

59:47.718 --> 59:49.318
You had one fucking job.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.719
One job.

59:50.721 --> 59:52.988
<i>Un</i> fucking <i> trabajo --</i>

59:52.990 --> 59:56.191

not only lose the phones,

59:59.363 --> 01:00:02.631
but $100,000 worth of molly,
huh?

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:03.632
Hundred K.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:05.634
I swear I didn't lose it.

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.870
Unc, what the fuck?

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:10.272
You're dead.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.174
Come on, man.
You can't kill me.

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:13.642
I'm your nephew.

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:15.677

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:17.079
You're right.

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:19.181
I made a promise to your father.

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:20.949
My brother!

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.286
Please, let me slap

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.688

I think I know what happened.
Listen.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:33.228
I was in the back,
kickin' it with some fans.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:37.099
Like, I took my eye off them for
a second while I was performing.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.802
Mm-hmm.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.704
Smell like that bullshit to me,
Pablo.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:45.674
That's how they had managed
to take some boxes.

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:47.743

- Yeah. Who's "they"?

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:14.562
That's a little extra

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:17.031
I don't need no extra.
Get these damn phones.

'Cause she's sweet, like you.

01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:46.127
Sweet like Chu?
Who?

01:12:46.129 --> 01:12:47.995

Take your phones!

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:02.910
I don't do that.

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:04.445
Oh, that's okay, honey.
Don't cry.

01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:05.813
It gets better with me.

Wow.
You know him?

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:46.587
Whoa, whoa, ha!

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.689
You know what motherfuckin' time
it is!

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:50.024
Trey up in here.

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:52.760
Put your motherfuckin' hands
down, sly nigga.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:53.861
What's up, nigga?

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:55.563
Tomorrow, though.

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:56.898
Trey in here!

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.633
Everything from
the motherfuckin' shelf

01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:00.902
going for the low --
usually for the high.

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:02.537
What's up, nephew?

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:03.871
Sellin' them
motherfuckin' phones.

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:05.573
You can keep sellin' them
and call yourself.

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:07.141
- Fly nigga. What's up?
- What up?

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:09.811
What's that, Gucci you got on?
Your green don't match.

01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:11.979
I ain't never seen Gucci
in Jamaican green, nigga.

01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:13.614
What's up, my nigga?

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.650
There you go.
Little light-skinned nigga, huh?

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:17.485
Hey, look. I'm'a get you
a better belt than that.

01:14:17.487 --> 01:14:19.153
You got the low KGs on that?

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:20.922
Fuck with Trey
and I'm'a upgrade you, nigga.

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:23.057
See these?
Get Money Volume 1s.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:25.593
I got the 2s in the house.

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:28.196
Oh, shit! There she go.
Baby girl!

01:14:28.198 --> 01:14:30.665
There it is. Sunday!

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:32.800
I'm'a pray to you every day
of the week, girl.

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:38.039
You was with him one day --
one day! -- and he got shot.

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:40.708
If I wanted him dead,
I would've smoked him myself,

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.844
but dead niggas can't pay
child support.

01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:44.612
Think, son!
Think!

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:46.147
You need to get
your act together

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:48.549
if you're even thinking
about moving back into my house.

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:50.117
Smokin' weed around kids.

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:52.253
- Get your ass out of here.
- What's up, little brother?

01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:54.589
And save me some of that weed.

01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:56.657
Look, boo, I need you to watch
these kids of ours,

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.526
Devin and Darnise,
'cause I got a date,

01:14:58.528 --> 01:15:00.261
and I don't need this new nigga
knowing how many kids I got

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:01.562
'cause of your dumb ass.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.164
Them ain't my kids.

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:05.066
- They ain't even look like me.
- They look just like you.

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:07.635
- Good hair and everything.
- They look Tiger Woods.

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:10.204
Get your ass up and bring me
my child-support money.

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:13.574
You got money for weed, then
got money for my child support.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:17.178
Do it look like I can get
to the bank?

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.180
I'm s-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can you speak up?

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.115
I-I can't hear you
'cause you're not talking about

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:22.517
having my motherfucking money!

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:23.751
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:25.286
"Ow, ow, ow."
Yeah.

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:27.154
Now, I know
the neighborhood thug

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:28.656
done bust a cap up in your ass

01:15:28.658 --> 01:15:30.224
and he got you all injured
and shit,

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:34.161
but as soon as your broke,
sorry, wack-ass, no-good ass

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:36.664
gets some money
and gets back on your feet,

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:39.233
I need you to run me my shit.

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:40.935
Is that understood?

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:42.670
With your
erectile-dysfunction-having ass.

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:43.838
What? Huh?

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.973
Yeah, they told me.
Limp dick.

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:49.877
You are nothing but the devil,
and until you do right by me --

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.145
Save the "Color Purple" quotes

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:52.847
and transfer me my money,
all right?

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:55.316
I got Venmo, Cash App, PayPal,
QuickPay with Zelle.

01:15:55.318 --> 01:15:56.918
I invested in one of them
little black banks

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.586
when everybody was doing
Black Lives Matter.

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:00.555
I put $100 in there.
I even still got a RushCard.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:02.156
So if you don't have some money
on one of my accounts

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:05.259
by the morning, I'm calling
my cousin on you again.

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:16.337
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:19.807
What the f--
What's going on, man?

01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:26.747
You going somewhere, Mr. Black?

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.617
How you know my name?

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:32.153
I know a lot of things
about you.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:35.323
My name is Pablo Vargas,

01:16:35.325 --> 01:16:37.792
and you got something
that belongs to me.

01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:40.895
What?

01:16:40.897 --> 01:16:42.897
That's the fat piece of shit

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:45.032
and that motherfucking
skinny piece of shit, too.

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:47.368
Me? Me?

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.273
The fuck going on?

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.975
I don't know what the fuck
he talking about.

01:16:53.977 --> 01:16:55.876
- I don't know. I don't know.
- I don't -- I don't...

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.178
Come straight with me.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.846
Unc, you know
I'll tell you anything.

01:16:58.848 --> 01:17:00.247
Did y'all take anything
from him?

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.116
We took some phones.
That's all I know.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.785
- Spyda took the phones.
- I took --<i> We</i> took the phones.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.287
That's where y'all got
them phones?

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:07.922
That's where we --
I didn't know!

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:09.757
- Hold up. Hold up.
- We took them from a rapper.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:11.092
I don't know...

01:17:11.094 --> 01:17:12.660
Check it out, boss.

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:14.729
Seem like it's some type
of misunderstanding.

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:16.664
My people did say
they took some phones.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:19.266
I want to make it good with you.

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:23.104
I want my money...
I want my phones...

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:24.905
and I want my fucking molly.

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:26.974
Hold up.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:29.176
I'm'a get you the money
and the phones.

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:30.778
I don't know nothing
about no drugs.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.380
We don't do drugs around here.

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:33.814
You sure about that?

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:36.384
Looks like you don't know
your people.

01:17:36.386 --> 01:17:37.752
Hold up.

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:44.659
Get me the motherfucking money
and the phones.

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.127
And what this shit is
about drugs?

01:17:46.129 --> 01:17:47.695
I don't know about no drugs.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.664
Now, I-I did take the --
I did take the phones.

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:50.998
- I don't know about no drugs.
- We didn't mess with no drugs.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.733
- That's what I said.
- So look.

01:17:52.735 --> 01:17:55.269
Lie to me again, I'm gonna let
them shoot this place up.

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:57.004
They want y'all.
They don't want me.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.906
- They don't -- They want <i> us.</i>
- Lie to us again --

01:17:58.908 --> 01:18:01.008
Lie to us again, we're gonna
let them shoot this bitch up.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.977
I don't want to die.
Like, I just want to --

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:04.412
Get off me
and go get the money.

01:18:04.414 --> 01:18:06.113
- Give me the bag.
- They gonna kill us, Black.

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:07.448
- Give me the bag.
- They gonna kill us.

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:10.184
Please don't --
don't give them that bag.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.886
Just let 'em...

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:14.155
Look. Look, look.
I'm'a handle it.

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:16.857
I dumped the money.

01:18:17.827 --> 01:18:19.260
I got your money...

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:20.795
Nikki.

01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:23.998
...and the last of the phones.

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:25.700
We good?

01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:28.836
Are we good?

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:30.905
We good.

01:18:30.907 --> 01:18:32.973
- What the fuck he said?
- I don't know what he said.

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:34.475
Let me tell you something.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:36.310
I'm gonna take the money,

01:18:36.312 --> 01:18:39.013
and I'm gonna take the remainder
of my phones.

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:41.282
I'm gonna give you
till the end of the week

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:44.885
to give me my $130,000.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:48.022
If not, I'm coming back
to kill you,

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:51.892
that fat ogre of yours,
and that skinny piece of shit.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.062
I'm also gonna come back
and kill your children

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:58.332
and anything that you hold
in regards.

01:18:58.334 --> 01:18:59.366
Do you understand me?

01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:01.202
<i>¿Me entiendes?</i>

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:04.438
One week.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.744
And, uh... if I hear
that you're talking to the cops,

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:11.979
I'm gonna start with your kids
first.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.248
<i>Vamonos.</i>

01:19:23.226 --> 01:19:25.960
Y'all closed, man?
Y'all ain't got no burgers?

01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:27.495
Naw, big dawg.
We're closed, Blaq.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.097
Man, I swear, Unc.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.832
I promise you on everything,
we gonna get this money.

01:19:31.834 --> 01:19:33.300
I promise you.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.002
What you think they gonna do
to us if we don't?

01:19:35.004 --> 01:19:36.403
Pop, look.
I got an idea.

01:19:36.405 --> 01:19:38.305
Me and my crew,
we was working on something

01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:42.009
we think can change the game
in the tech world -- Live-Fi.

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:44.245
This emitter
goes into your phone,

01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:46.881
and it uses light
instead of Wi-Fi

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:48.949
to connect to the Internet.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.985
And for a one-time fee,

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:54.488
everybody will have unlimited
Internet and cell service.

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:55.890
We could charge the world?

01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:57.424
Charge the world.

01:19:57.426 --> 01:20:02.229
Take a good look, 'cause this
right here is the key.

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:05.466
So now that the hardest part
is over, let's try it out.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.201
Hey, Fatboy.
Try this, man.

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:08.269
Me?

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:09.904
Yeah.
It's for you.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:12.473
- Fuck it.
- PETER:

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:15.176
You college kids stay
with these caffeine pills.

01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:18.179
Oh, no, dude.
That's not caffeine, bro.

01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:21.215
That's my special blend --
ecstasy with an Adderall chaser,

01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:22.550
Yeah.

01:20:22.552 --> 01:20:24.552
- What the fuck you mean?!
- What?

01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:27.021
Why you didn't warn me
what was in it?!

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:29.190
Bro!
What does it even matter, man?

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:31.125
- Like, what the fuck?
- What you mean, what it matter?

01:20:31.127 --> 01:20:33.060
I mean it doesn't --
I gave you free drugs.

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:34.395
Like, what?

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:35.963
- You're not gonna take it?
- Free, my ass!

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:37.364
- I should fuck you up!
- Whoa, man.

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:39.133
If I get fucked up,
you gonna take me home?

01:20:39.135 --> 01:20:41.502
That's hostile, bro.
Like, chill.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:43.270

Yeah.

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:45.339

I should have never took it.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.408

No, I won't take you home.

I'm not interested

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:32.539
But you may be interested
in keeping your job.

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:35.743
Now, if you work with me
and cooperate,

01:23:35.745 --> 01:23:39.513
what we talk about and discuss
in here stay in this room.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.750
But there's one thing
I don't understand --

01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:45.619
how an educated woman like
yourself with a great career

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:48.589
gets tangled up with a criminal
like Pablo Vargas.

01:23:48.591 --> 01:23:50.524
What?

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:52.459
Who the hell is Pablo?

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:54.661
Shavon, this isn't helping.

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:56.764
I need you to be honest with me,
okay?

01:23:56.766 --> 01:23:59.700
Look, I don't know
about any gangsters or Pablo.

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:02.436
All I did was turn out on a few
phones for a friend in a bind.

01:24:02.438 --> 01:24:03.437
I swear.

01:24:03.439 --> 01:24:05.406
Okay.

01:24:05.408 --> 01:24:09.476
So you want me to believe
that you had no idea

01:24:09.478 --> 01:24:12.713
these phones were being stolen
for drug-trafficking purposes?

01:24:12.715 --> 01:24:14.281
What?

01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:16.350
Hell no, I didn't know that.

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:18.552
My God!
I'm gonna kill Black.

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:20.754
I'm sorry.
Who?

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:35.669
Aah!

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.790
<i>Dios mío,</i> Johnny.
I'm sorry.

01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:59.226
Um, I thought you had left
already.

01:24:59.228 --> 01:25:00.861
Nope.
Still here.

01:25:00.863 --> 01:25:03.564

01:25:03.566 --> 01:25:04.765

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:06.533
I know this case is personal
for you,

01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:08.569
but I just wanted you to know
if you're staying late,

01:25:08.571 --> 01:25:09.870
then so am I.

01:25:10.473 --> 01:25:13.540
Wow.
So Diaz has a heart.

01:25:13.542 --> 01:25:16.376
Unless you have other reasons
you're in the male locker room

01:25:16.378 --> 01:25:18.712
you don't want to tell me
about.

01:25:18.714 --> 01:25:20.447
But no.
Um, you don't have to stay.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:22.416
I'm actually about to leave
anyways.

01:25:22.418 --> 01:25:24.718
So enjoy your night.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.220
You sure
you weren't stalking me?

01:25:26.222 --> 01:25:27.721
Because that timing
was impeccable --

01:25:27.723 --> 01:25:30.224
like, me reaching in here
and you popping up behind me

01:25:30.226 --> 01:25:31.758
and my towel dropping, like...

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.827

to you?

01:25:33.829 --> 01:25:36.163
Oh!

01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:38.599
Okay. Go Home.
Go Home Dana.

01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:40.134
Definitely stalking me.

01:25:40.136 --> 01:25:41.535
How you know about Go Home Dana?

01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:43.337
Everybody knows
about Go Home Dana.

01:25:43.339 --> 01:25:45.172
Okay.
All right.

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:46.874
You <i> are</i> stalking me.
Okay.

01:25:49.245 --> 01:25:51.345
Uh, so...

01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:55.649
I'll see you tomorrow, Miller.

01:25:56.852 --> 01:25:58.619
<i>Adiós,</i> Diaz.

01:26:12.368 --> 01:26:14.368
Who is that?

01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:16.170
What's going on, cuzzo?!

01:26:16.172 --> 01:26:17.638
Oh, that's Johnny.
You play too much.

How I play too much?

01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:21.542
Why you nervous?
What's up?

01:26:21.544 --> 01:26:23.210
Something you want to
tell me about?

01:26:23.212 --> 01:26:25.279
- Nah. You just play too much.

01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:26.446
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:26:26.448 --> 01:26:27.915
Shouldn't you be saving
the world

01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:30.250
or policing something out here

01:26:30.252 --> 01:26:32.452
or stopping your people
from killing brothers?

01:26:32.454 --> 01:26:35.222
- Wow. You really gonna go there.
- Yeah, I'm'a go there.

01:26:35.224 --> 01:26:36.823
You think I can stop
all the bad cops?

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:38.425
- Yeah.
- I'm doing my part.

01:26:38.427 --> 01:26:40.661
- You doing your part in life?
- Y-Yes.

There's devils.

01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:43.530
- I don't know that.
- There's skinny dudes.

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:45.465
There's fat dudes.
I need to holler at Unc.

01:26:45.467 --> 01:26:46.833
Are we gonna do this right now?

01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:51.805
She didn't snitch.

01:26:51.807 --> 01:26:54.374
I'm just good at my job.

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:55.709
I know she ain't snitch.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:58.278
I'm just wondering
what about you.

01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:01.248
Really?

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.317
Wow.

01:27:03.319 --> 01:27:05.252
We're blood.

01:27:05.254 --> 01:27:07.754
You know, since a little kid,
I've always done what's right.

01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:09.990
I don't need a uniform for that.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:13.427
Now, you -- you're connected
to these phones,

01:27:13.429 --> 01:27:15.629
and these phones are connected
to Pablo.

01:27:15.631 --> 01:27:17.998
This case is personal for me.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.601
So I need you to tell me
everything you know.

01:27:20.603 --> 01:27:22.970
I already told you
everything I know, nephew.

01:27:22.972 --> 01:27:24.638
I don't know no Pablo.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.774
I get it, Unc.
I do.

01:27:27.776 --> 01:27:30.010
But you got to cut off
the business with him

01:27:30.012 --> 01:27:31.645
if you want me to help you.

01:27:31.647 --> 01:27:34.314
I can't help you
if you continue.

01:27:36.285 --> 01:27:38.418
Am I under arrest, Officer,
or what?

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.954
You may fit the description
dressed like that.

01:27:40.956 --> 01:27:42.656
Hoodie and shades at night,
huh, Unc?

01:27:42.658 --> 01:27:44.491
I'm just going to take
a little swim.

01:27:44.493 --> 01:27:45.792
Okay.

01:27:47.329 --> 01:27:49.463
Have a nice day, Officer.

01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:52.866
Unc, you can tell me anything.

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:07.774
<i>Así me gusta.</i>

01:29:07.776 --> 01:29:10.110
You showed up on time,

01:29:10.112 --> 01:29:12.979
the true definition
of a businessman.

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:15.549
I trust you have my money.

01:29:15.551 --> 01:29:17.651
You know I ain't got nothing
to do with is.

01:29:17.653 --> 01:29:18.819
That's most of it.

01:29:18.821 --> 01:29:20.420
I'll get the rest in three days,

01:29:20.422 --> 01:29:22.856
and you can take the Benz
if you need it, homey.

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:26.393
Three days?

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:28.462
Three days?

01:29:28.464 --> 01:29:31.398
The agreement was to have
the money in full.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.900
I don't do no installment plans.

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:37.437
And does it look like I need
a fucking Benz?

01:29:37.439 --> 01:29:39.406
Wait!

01:29:39.408 --> 01:29:40.841
I got the money.

01:29:40.843 --> 01:29:42.809
Didn't I tell you
not to come around here?

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:44.578
And where you get money from?

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:45.879
I got you.

01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:48.448
I only got $4,000, though.

01:29:51.019 --> 01:29:52.619
They're still short.

01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:54.421
No, we ain't. No, we ain't.
No, we ain't.

01:29:54.423 --> 01:29:56.022
Watch your mouth.
I got some money.

01:29:56.024 --> 01:29:58.458
Boy, you know I stay loaded.
Let me...

01:30:01.597 --> 01:30:03.463
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty.

01:30:03.465 --> 01:30:05.665
How much you short?
Twenty? Fo--

01:30:05.667 --> 01:30:08.001
He'll get me.
He'll get me.

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:09.736
He'll get me.
He'll...

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:11.772
Oh, don't -- don't be snatching.
That's my last.

01:30:11.774 --> 01:30:13.473
Bitch, I don't give a damn
how much I owe you.

01:30:13.475 --> 01:30:14.541
That's <i> my</i> last.

01:30:14.543 --> 01:30:16.543
I got shit to do.
Shoot 'em!

01:30:16.545 --> 01:30:17.677
Freeze!

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:19.413
Time's up, Pablo.

01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:21.181
Drop the guns.

01:30:21.717 --> 01:30:24.684
There's one of you...
and how many of us?

01:30:24.686 --> 01:30:25.852
Too many!

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:28.488
If I go, we all got to go.

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:31.925
Now, make this less messy
and drop the guns.

01:30:37.466 --> 01:30:39.032
Do it.

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:42.469
Nice to see that you know
how to follow your own rules.

01:31:02.624 --> 01:31:04.591
Freeze, bitch!

01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:12.632
Don't you move!

01:31:29.518 --> 01:31:32.819
Dumbasses always shoot
at the vest.

01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:34.955
- Drop your weapon!
- Unh-unh!

01:31:34.957 --> 01:31:36.823
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop it!

01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:38.525
I'll drop it.

01:31:38.527 --> 01:31:42.762
Let's... drop... the weapons.

01:31:42.764 --> 01:31:44.965
Oh, for real?

01:31:44.967 --> 01:31:47.000
An old-fashioned ass-whooping.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.502
Ah.

01:31:48.504 --> 01:31:49.736
Ah.

01:31:51.907 --> 01:31:53.106
What you got?
What you got?

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:54.708
Ha!
Ya-ha!

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:55.842
Oh, shit!

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:02.883
Okay.

01:32:06.154 --> 01:32:07.854
Wah-hai!

01:32:15.764 --> 01:32:17.264
Fucking asshole!

01:32:17.266 --> 01:32:20.000
Smack me like a bitch.

01:32:44.826 --> 01:32:46.326
Listen, devil witch!

01:32:46.328 --> 01:32:48.328
I'm not going to hell
for hitting no woman, okay?!

01:32:48.330 --> 01:32:50.230
My keys? Really?

01:32:50.232 --> 01:32:52.265
Oh! What --

01:32:57.239 --> 01:32:59.573
Oh.
Let me knock her ass out.

01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:16.189
That's enough, Pop.

01:33:16.191 --> 01:33:18.024
Pop!
That's enough!

01:33:18.026 --> 01:33:20.226
Pop!
That's enough!

01:33:27.869 --> 01:33:30.103
Get his ass out of here!

01:33:37.346 --> 01:33:39.145
And you!

01:33:39.147 --> 01:33:41.181
When are you gonna learn
to follow my damn lead?

01:33:41.183 --> 01:33:42.649
What are you talking about?
I was --

01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:49.322
Really?
Right here at the crime scene?

01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.760
Be in my office.

01:33:55.998 --> 01:33:58.331

about this off duty.

01:35:41.503 --> 01:35:44.437
I'm nurturing the baby!

01:35:44.439 --> 01:35:46.306
Mr. Mimm!
Oh, yeah.

01:35:46.308 --> 01:35:48.141
I snuck in on your ass,
didn't I?

01:35:48.143 --> 01:35:50.877
Word on the street is that you
running some type of naked yoga.

01:35:50.879 --> 01:35:53.113
If I find out that you fucking
my girl...

01:35:53.115 --> 01:35:54.848
Oh, yeah.
I heard it was you.

01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:57.817
'Cause I saw a flip phone
and some Viagras in her purse.

01:35:57.819 --> 01:35:59.886
- That's your black ass.
- You called me.

01:35:59.888 --> 01:36:01.287
Yeah, you damn right.

01:36:01.289 --> 01:36:03.356
The woman with the big
watermelon titties...

01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:05.058
- Yeah, that's her.
- ...and the watermelon ass.

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.127
- You must like watermelon a lot.
- Yeah, I love watermelon,

01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:08.928
I eat watermelon,
and I pay for watermelon.

01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:11.297
If I find out
that your Five Heartbeat ass

01:36:11.299 --> 01:36:12.932
- was fucking her...
- Yeah.

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:14.267
...that's your last dragon.

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:16.236
You hear me?
And take that picture down.

01:36:16.238 --> 01:36:18.338
That ain't you no more.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.273
Fuck you!

01:36:20.842 --> 01:36:22.242
Shirley!

01:36:22.244 --> 01:36:24.244
Your husband is a bitch!

01:36:24.246 --> 01:36:26.946
First of all, nigga,
how old are you?

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:28.548
I don't give a fuck.

01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:30.850
Well, are you wearing diapers
or Pull-Ups?

01:36:30.852 --> 01:36:33.253
How the fuck are you gonna
ever talk to me like that?

01:36:33.255 --> 01:36:35.321
I don't know whether I should
slap you or give you a bottle.

01:36:35.323 --> 01:36:37.090
What the fuck age range are you?

01:36:37.092 --> 01:36:39.993
You look like <i> cabrón.</i>
You know <i> cabrón?</i>

01:36:39.995 --> 01:36:42.228
- Who the fuck is <i> cabrón?</i>
- I don't fucking know.

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:43.963
Are you a parent
or you have parents?

01:36:43.965 --> 01:36:45.331
Who -- What are you doing here?

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:47.467
Your color is like this color.

01:36:49.037 --> 01:36:50.937
Don't ever disrespect me.
I don't give a fuck.

01:36:50.939 --> 01:36:52.806
I don't give a fuck
if you can crawl or --

01:36:52.808 --> 01:36:54.340
If you can crawl,
we can brawl, bitch.

01:36:54.342 --> 01:36:57.076
Why you got gun?
You're not fucking police.

01:36:57.078 --> 01:37:00.146
I will kill you with a BB gun,
you little-ass nigga.

01:37:00.148 --> 01:37:01.514
You're a grown baby nigga.

01:37:01.516 --> 01:37:04.884
You're an old infant,
a 30-year-old baby.

01:37:04.886 --> 01:37:08.254
I don't know if I should
fight you or just get a...

01:37:08.256 --> 01:37:11.057
What is this?
Who -- What size is that, 11T?

01:37:11.059 --> 01:37:12.258
What size is your outfit?

01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.360
- I don't know.
- Are those long-sleeve...

01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:16.229
Size 5.

01:37:16.231 --> 01:37:18.865
You're a grown nigga
wearing baby clothes.

01:37:18.867 --> 01:37:21.134
Why you call me a baby?
You know me?

01:37:21.136 --> 01:37:23.036
I-I -- That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

01:37:23.038 --> 01:37:25.071
I'm a police officer.
I just want to know --

01:37:25.073 --> 01:37:27.173
Do I call your parents,
or do I call the cops?

01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:28.908
I'm a cop.
That's why I'm here.

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:30.877
- Is it raining now?
- It's not fucking raining.

01:37:30.879 --> 01:37:32.478
I like an umbrella.

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.347
Why you want an umbrella for?

01:37:34.349 --> 01:37:36.149
You need to be
in a fucking stroller.

01:37:36.151 --> 01:37:38.017
Get this little nigga
out of here for me, please.

01:37:38.019 --> 01:37:39.619
Where are your grandparents?

01:37:39.621 --> 01:37:42.021
You want to go to Chuck E.
Cheese or play games with me?

01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:43.423
You ugly-ass nigga.

01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:47.126
I know I'm ugly,
but what do I do with you?

01:37:47.128 --> 01:37:49.262
Who are you fucking with?
Who are you?

01:37:49.264 --> 01:37:52.198

Hello. May I ask you guys
a few questions?

01:42:04.152 --> 01:42:05.585
Have you seen anything?

01:42:05.587 --> 01:42:08.488
Man, we don't talk to the jakes
around here, man.

01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:10.490
You know me.
We go back.

01:42:10.492 --> 01:42:13.359
Like I say, Johnny, we don't
talk to the jakes around here.

01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:16.662
You don't talk to the jakes, but
you call me by my first name.

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.433
Chill out, Nana!
What's wrong with you?

01:42:20.435 --> 01:42:21.901
I need my money.
That's what's wrong.

01:42:21.903 --> 01:42:24.470
But you can't come in here
screaming like that.

01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:25.705
Shorty, what's happening?

01:42:25.707 --> 01:42:27.773
You know you still owe me
that money.

01:42:27.775 --> 01:42:29.142
I'm just here to get my money.

01:42:29.144 --> 01:42:30.510
Didn't I give you
your last check?

01:42:30.512 --> 01:42:32.178
You gave me my last check,

01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.779
but you ain't give me
my <i> last</i> last check.

01:42:33.781 --> 01:42:35.882
If I gave you your last check,
you should be straight.

01:42:35.884 --> 01:42:37.583
No, no, no.

01:42:37.585 --> 01:42:39.785
You still owe me
'cause I worked more,

01:42:39.787 --> 01:42:40.920
so I need more.

01:42:40.922 --> 01:42:42.722
So that mean we fired you

01:42:42.724 --> 01:42:44.624
'cause you wasn't doing
something right.

01:42:44.626 --> 01:42:47.693
I was doing everything right,
Black. Come on, now.

01:42:47.695 --> 01:42:50.363

01:42:52.834 --> 01:42:54.367
$9.86.

01:42:54.369 --> 01:42:57.203
Now, you came up in here
for $9.86.

01:42:57.205 --> 01:42:59.839
It's about the principle, Black.
The principle.

01:42:59.841 --> 01:43:02.241
Oh, okay. Principle.

01:43:02.243 --> 01:43:03.776
I'm'a give you $20

01:43:03.778 --> 01:43:06.412

01:43:06.414 --> 01:43:08.681
Thank you.
Nice doing business with you.

01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:10.917
What did I do with my weed?

01:43:10.919 --> 01:43:13.653
I know I set it somewhere
close by.

01:43:13.655 --> 01:43:14.820
Boy, have you seen my weed?

01:43:14.822 --> 01:43:16.222
- Your weed?
- Yes.

01:43:16.224 --> 01:43:17.723
- Weed?!
- Yes.

01:43:17.725 --> 01:43:19.825
- I ain't see no weed, Titi.
- Don't play.

01:43:19.827 --> 01:43:21.227
Real talk!
I ain't seen no weed.

01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:22.929
I don't trust my sister.

01:43:22.931 --> 01:43:24.630
I don't trust you kids.

01:43:24.632 --> 01:43:26.399
I don't let nobody come
to my house

01:43:26.401 --> 01:43:28.501
'cause something
always coming up missing.

01:43:28.503 --> 01:43:30.670
And I look everywhere.
I can't find it.

01:43:30.672 --> 01:43:31.837
So it must be you.

01:43:31.839 --> 01:43:33.372
Must have been me?

01:43:33.374 --> 01:43:34.607
It didn't disappear
until you got here.

01:43:34.609 --> 01:43:36.475
Y'all killing me with this shit!

01:43:36.477 --> 01:43:38.678
- Kill you?
- This my life you playing with!

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.713
What's up with you, slick?

01:43:40.715 --> 01:43:43.482
You gonna let us in or what?

01:43:44.452 --> 01:43:46.686
Michael,
I thought that we paid you

01:43:46.688 --> 01:43:48.921
to keep the drug dealers
outside of the establishment.

01:43:48.923 --> 01:43:50.690
It's a simple task, really.

01:43:50.692 --> 01:43:52.391
Drug dealers?

01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:53.893
I got a woman here
I'm coming to see.

01:43:53.895 --> 01:43:55.428
Security.

01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:57.430
Who's this bitch
talking about drug dealers?

01:43:57.432 --> 01:43:59.298
My Uncle Black owns a business.

01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.766
<i>We</i> own the business.

01:44:00.768 --> 01:44:02.835
- We business owners.
- Straight up. Look here.

01:44:02.837 --> 01:44:05.571
I'm coming to see my girl, so I
ain't even trippin' off of you.

01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:06.973
I'm sure you don't have a girl

01:44:06.975 --> 01:44:08.975
that works
in this establishment.

01:44:08.977 --> 01:44:10.276
Tell him, Michael.

01:44:10.278 --> 01:44:11.744
Nobody know your bougie ass.

01:44:11.746 --> 01:44:13.479
Nobody knows you.

01:44:13.481 --> 01:44:14.981
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, baby.

01:44:14.983 --> 01:44:17.283
I thought I asked you to meet me
outside.

01:44:17.285 --> 01:44:19.752
- I brought your favorites.
- Oh!

01:44:20.488 --> 01:44:22.455
How fitting.
A hood special.

01:44:22.457 --> 01:44:25.891
There's carnations and alcohol.

01:44:25.893 --> 01:44:27.827
- What is wrong with her?
- I don't know.

01:44:27.829 --> 01:44:29.395
She need a man or something.

01:44:29.397 --> 01:44:31.497
Yeah. She need a real thug nigga
to put it on her.

01:44:31.499 --> 01:44:32.865
Don't touch me!

01:44:32.867 --> 01:44:34.400
- Oh, my God.
- You don't know me like that!

01:44:34.402 --> 01:44:36.302
- I'll whip your ass.
- Don't touch me!

01:44:36.304 --> 01:44:38.404
- I'll whip --
- You fuckin' rent-a-cop!

01:44:38.406 --> 01:44:40.906
Mr. Mimms or Mr. Woo

01:44:40.908 --> 01:44:43.576
or whatever the hell you're
calling yourself nowadays,

01:44:43.578 --> 01:44:46.445
are you aware that there are
several sexual-harassment

01:44:46.447 --> 01:44:48.414
and peeping-Tom claims
against you?

01:44:48.416 --> 01:44:49.882
This is absurd.

01:44:49.884 --> 01:44:52.752
I don't appreciate people
talking about my business.

01:44:52.754 --> 01:44:54.654
I run a well-oiled machine.

01:44:54.656 --> 01:44:56.289
Yeah.
That's your problem.

01:44:56.291 --> 01:44:58.624
Women come to my business,
and they ashy.

01:44:58.626 --> 01:44:59.759
Mm-hmm.

01:44:59.761 --> 01:45:01.961
I use a natural program.

01:45:01.963 --> 01:45:03.496
Yeah.

01:45:03.498 --> 01:45:05.798
There is also
a child-support claim

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.933
against a child named Adonis.

01:45:07.935 --> 01:45:09.769
Drake's kid?

01:45:09.771 --> 01:45:11.470
Bullshit!

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:12.805
Oh, shit.

01:45:12.807 --> 01:45:15.074
If it isn't Melvin Taylor.

01:45:15.076 --> 01:45:16.609
I remember you
from back in the day.

01:45:16.611 --> 01:45:18.344
Your unpaid
Derek Jeter-looking ass

01:45:18.346 --> 01:45:20.346
used to be scared
of the neighborhood cat.

01:45:20.348 --> 01:45:21.847
Now you a gangster, huh?

01:45:21.849 --> 01:45:23.616
You think you tough
coming in here with guns,

01:45:23.618 --> 01:45:24.750
trying to scare these models?

01:45:24.752 --> 01:45:26.319
Nigga, you bitch-made!

01:45:26.321 --> 01:45:29.689
Let me handle this clown,
2 Pistols.

01:45:29.691 --> 01:45:32.058
Shit. Please.
Pistols, let me handle it.

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:35.361
I got this.
I got this.

01:45:35.363 --> 01:45:36.762

01:45:36.764 --> 01:45:38.664

01:45:38.666 --> 01:45:39.965

01:45:41.703 --> 01:45:43.402
- I just want to touch you.
- Fuck no, man!

01:45:43.404 --> 01:45:44.904
- Get your ass up out of here!
- Man, fuck all that.

01:45:44.906 --> 01:45:46.539
- Fuck all that.

01:45:46.541 --> 01:45:48.341
I got this.

01:45:48.343 --> 01:45:49.675
That's right.

01:45:49.677 --> 01:45:53.112
You need to watch your mouth...
Dwayne.

01:45:53.114 --> 01:45:56.015
Only shit running is your mouth.

01:45:56.017 --> 01:45:57.917
- It's 2 Pistols now.
- Whoo!

01:45:57.919 --> 01:45:59.652
That's right.

01:45:59.654 --> 01:46:01.921
And I know your bitch ass
don't want none of this smoke.

01:46:03.424 --> 01:46:04.924
Who the fuck you think
you gonna shoot

01:46:04.926 --> 01:46:06.759
holding them guns like that,
nigga?

01:46:06.761 --> 01:46:08.094
You about to find out.

01:46:08.096 --> 01:46:10.096
Say what's up to Michael
and Prince.

01:46:10.098 --> 01:46:13.366
Aa-a-a-a-a-h!

01:46:13.368 --> 01:46:15.701
Aa-a-a-a-a-h!

01:46:21.943 --> 01:46:25.010
Nigga, you have the audacity
to shoot at <i> me,</i> nigga?

01:46:25.012 --> 01:46:26.846
Aah!

01:46:27.882 --> 01:46:29.949
Damn.
Not again.

01:46:29.951 --> 01:46:32.818
I'm Officer Midnight.
This is "I Got the Hook-up 2."

01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:34.120
Where the fuck was you
last night

01:46:34.122 --> 01:46:35.988
when all the shit
was going down?

01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:37.690
Why are you black?

01:46:37.692 --> 01:46:39.158
Why are you looking at me
like that?

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:41.727
I have a gun. I will kill you.
Fuck you.

01:46:41.729 --> 01:46:44.630
Shut the fuck up when I talk
to you and listen to me.

01:46:44.632 --> 01:46:45.898
Listen to me.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.533
Close your eyes
and open your eyes.

01:46:47.935 --> 01:46:49.902
Who is this nigga
and why is he here?

01:46:51.806 --> 01:46:54.540
What the fuck do you want?

01:46:54.542 --> 01:46:56.709
Get out of here right now,

01:46:56.711 --> 01:46:58.144

01:46:58.146 --> 01:46:59.678
Okay. Shit.
Who is this nigga?

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.480
Who knew?

01:47:01.482 --> 01:47:03.015
- Hey, man!
- Man, you don't --

01:47:09.791 --> 01:47:10.923

Okay. All right.
