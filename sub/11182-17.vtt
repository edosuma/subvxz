01:11.972 --> 01:14.742
-I got it! I got it!
-What are you talking about?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.477
The Pot of Gold game
at the supermarket.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.079
-Well, what did you get?
-The picture of a back end
of a car.

01:21.782 --> 01:22.916
What are you supposed to
do with that?

01:22.983 --> 01:24.352
If I get the front end, I win.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.957
-You win a car?
-No. A year's supply
of car wax.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.562
What good is wax?
You don't even own a car.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.665
Well, when I win one,
it sure will be shiny...

01:39.233 --> 01:40.501
(DOORBELL RINGS)

01:40.568 --> 01:42.503
Oh, would you get that,
Miss Jefferson?

01:44.838 --> 01:47.775
I'm so excited,
I can hardly
catch my breath.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.178
I wish you'd stay that way.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.482
Oh, hi, Helen.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.418
-Louise, I have some
great news!
-Tom turned black?

02:01.522 --> 02:05.593
-You're gonna sit on the dais!
-I'm gonna sit on the what?

02:05.659 --> 02:08.329
I mean, at the banquet
we're going to next week.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.932
Louise is up for Volunteer
of the Year award.

02:11.999 --> 02:15.936
-Me?
-That's right. It's between
you and Agnes Simmons.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.806
-Hey, Weezy, that's great.
-Yeah, Miss Jefferson,
you deserve it.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.975
Oh, not as much as
Agnes Simmons.

02:22.042 --> 02:26.680
What do you mean? Nobody's
done as much work down at
the Help Center as you have.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.917
But I've never won
anything in my whole life.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.885
Oh, come on, Weezy,
you won me.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.356
Yeah, the booby prize.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.959
Who decides
who gets the award?

02:39.026 --> 02:41.862
Councilman Perry.
The Help Center
is in his district.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.864
Councilman Perry.
Ain't he up for
re-election?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.766
Yeah, I think so.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.735
Uh-huh. Don't worry
about it, Weezy,
you're gonna win.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.204
Oh, how can you be so sure?

02:50.271 --> 02:53.241
Look, George Jefferson
never picked
a loser in his life.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.076
I only hire them.

03:00.448 --> 03:05.118
Oh, if I win that award,
it'll be the biggest
thrill of my life.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.321
It will? Hmm...
Look, Weezy,

03:07.388 --> 03:08.889
why don't you take Helen
into the bedroom

03:08.956 --> 03:10.691
and show her the new dress
you got for the banquet?

03:10.758 --> 03:13.727
Okay. Come on, Helen.
If I win...

03:19.700 --> 03:23.804
-Well?
-I already seen
Miss Jefferson's new dress.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.773
Why don't you go
in the kitchen and take
a look at the mop?

03:25.839 --> 03:27.808
I'm sure you ain't seen
that in a long time.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.994
Hello, Joe? This is
George Jefferson.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.530
Yeah, look, you know
all those big shots
down at City Hall, right?

03:49.597 --> 03:54.335
Okay. Who is the campaign
manager for
Councilman Perry?

03:54.402 --> 03:59.573
Yeah. Yeah.
Elliot Kane.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.174
Okay, thanks.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.513
(COUGHING)

04:07.381 --> 04:09.049
(DOORBELL RINGS)

04:13.954 --> 04:15.323
-Mr. Jefferson?
-Yeah?

04:15.389 --> 04:18.426
-I'm Elliot Kane.
-Hey, how you doing?
Thanks for coming over.

04:18.492 --> 04:22.129
No problem. A campaign
manager will go anywhere
for a constituent.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.664
Oh, I ain't a constituent,
I'm a Democrat.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.802
Yes, well you said
on the phone that

04:28.869 --> 04:31.339
you were interested
in making a political
contribution?

04:31.405 --> 04:34.442
Oh, that's right. I hear
Councilman Perry is up
for re-election.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.677
Oh, and you would like to
offer your support?

04:36.744 --> 04:38.746
Well, I wanted to offer
a little more than that.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.781
Well, "support" is merely
a figure of speech.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.817
That's what I'm talking about.
A figure. You know,
the green kind.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.819
Oh, my favorite color.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.254
(BOTH LAUGH)

04:47.321 --> 04:48.956
Mine, too. After black.

04:52.125 --> 04:57.030
Yeah. Yeah, black
is beautiful.
But green is necessary.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.667
I heard that.
Hey, why don't you
have a seat?

04:59.733 --> 05:02.035
-Oh, thank you very much.
-No, no, no, right over here,

05:02.102 --> 05:05.005
-in front of
my wife's picture.
-Oh.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.074
So, this lovely
lady's your wife?

05:07.140 --> 05:10.578
Yup. I fixed it so that she
and the maid could be
at the movies tonight.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.546
You fixed it?

05:12.613 --> 05:14.648
Yeah, well see, Weezy's
not really into this
political stuff, you know.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.184
I mean, her real interest
is helping other people.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.187
-That's why she volunteers
at the Help Center.
-The Help Center?

05:20.253 --> 05:22.723
Sure. Councilman Perry is
supposed to be presenting

05:22.790 --> 05:26.059
-their Volunteer of the Year
award next week.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.897
And, uh, this lovely lady
here is up for it.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.834
Mr. Jefferson,
I'm beginning
to see your point.

05:33.901 --> 05:38.606
Of course, in politics,
one hand washes the other.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.975
Oh, well I'm ready to
supply the soap.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.679
Winning an election
requires a great deal
of lather.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.481
Well, how big a bar
do you need?

05:47.548 --> 05:50.551
Big. Like soap on a rope.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.788
Well, I was thinking more
like, small,

05:54.855 --> 05:57.558
you know like those
little bars they have
in motel rooms.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.462
Mr. Jefferson,
don't forget there are

06:01.529 --> 06:03.397
very expensive
television commercials,

06:03.464 --> 06:05.833
big newspaper ads,
a very large mailing...

06:05.899 --> 06:09.703
What, those little pamphlets
and those small little
bumper stickers...

06:09.770 --> 06:11.705
I mean, who
pays for those?

06:11.772 --> 06:14.642
I forget. And so does
Councilman Perry.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.111
Mmm-hmm.
How much would it take
to jar his memory?

06:18.178 --> 06:20.848
He'd certainly remember
a 1,000 dollar contribution.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.016
-A thousand? Hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.852
What would he think of
250 bucks?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.956
-Not much. 750?
-Oh. 300?

06:29.022 --> 06:32.225
-Five hundred?
-Sold. I mean, fine.

06:32.292 --> 06:36.597
All right, now who do I make
the check out to?

06:36.664 --> 06:38.932
Well, just make it
out to cash.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.834
-Cash? Is that legal?
-Mmm-hmm.

06:40.901 --> 06:45.238
Sure. Councilman Perry
already has a full quota of
contributions for this year.

06:45.305 --> 06:48.942
So, we'll put your
contribution into next
year's war chest.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.579
Oh... Okay, well,

06:51.645 --> 06:54.948
you just make sure that
Councilman Perry knows
that this check for cash

06:55.015 --> 06:56.917
came from Louise
Jefferson's husband.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.452
-Mmm-hmm.
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

06:58.519 --> 07:01.922
-He'll remember, all right.
-Good.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.958
-Come back later.
-Hey, I'm not selling
magazines!

07:05.025 --> 07:08.696
-I live here, remember?
-I'd like to forget.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.832
Where's Weezy?
Miss Willis invited her
upstairs for a minute.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.901
Whew, good.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.003
-Hello. Who are you?
-I'm Elliot Kane.
How do you do?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.105
I'm sorry you have to
leave so soon, Kane.

07:18.171 --> 07:21.675
-Drop in again sometime.
-Hey, I'll drop back anytime
for 500 bucks.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.478
Forget that. I mean,
don't forget it.

07:24.545 --> 07:28.148
Hey, Mr. Jefferson,
I won't forget. Don't worry.
Your wife is covered.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.750
(LAUGHS)

07:37.257 --> 07:41.662
-What's he talking about?
-Huh? Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, he sells insurance.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.430
I just bought Weezy
$500 worth.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.809
Florence!

08:01.014 --> 08:02.249
You looking for something?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.152
No, dummy. I'm seeing
if I can fit under the sofa.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.090
Oh, you can fit.
Just don't take
your mouth with you.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.130
Just help me
find my cufflinks.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.732
Did you look under the bar?

08:22.269 --> 08:25.372
Yep. It ain't there.
Did you look under
the dining room table?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.243
It ain't here either.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.080
Oh, then it must be
on the desk where
I left it this morning.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.721
-Hi, Alan.
-Hi.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.690
(LAUGHS)

08:42.756 --> 08:44.625
What's so funny?

08:44.692 --> 08:46.694
It's the first time
I've ever seen a zebra
dressed up like a penguin.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.599
Don't listen to him, Alan.
You look fine.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.901
Thanks, Florence.
And so do you.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.637
-That dress is a knockout.
-It oughta be.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.139
I knocked myself out
six months saving up for it.

09:00.741 --> 09:04.211
Oh, oh, look out. Here comes
the Volunteer of the Year.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.813
(CLAPPING)

09:05.879 --> 09:09.449
Mrs. Jefferson, I know
you're gonna win.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.052
-Hey, how do you know?
-Because I work with her
at the Help Center.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.654
She deserves it.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.089
Of course, she deserves it.
That's why she's gonna win.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.793
He's right, Miss Jefferson.
I ain't never seen
nobody work hard as you.

09:19.860 --> 09:23.797
And Florence should know.
She spends all of her time
watching other people work.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.033
(DOORBELL RINGS)

09:26.099 --> 09:29.002
Oh, no, let me get it.
This is a special night.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.710
-Hi, Florence.
-Hi, Miss Willis.
How do you like my new dress?

09:36.777 --> 09:41.581
-Oh, it's beautiful.
-Here, let me get
a picture of you.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.717
Tom, save the film
for the banquet.

09:43.784 --> 09:47.621
Well, Helen, I'm trying to get
the hang of this new camera by
just shooting any old thing.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.825
Well, thanks a lot.

09:51.892 --> 09:55.562
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
What I meant was, I...

09:55.629 --> 09:58.531
Oh, hi, honey.
My, you look nice.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.367
-Me? Look at you.
-Oh.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.469
-Hi, son.
-Hi, Dad.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.971
Man, that's an
expensive camera.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.673
Oh, it didn't cost me a thing.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.474
It was a gift from
a literary agent.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.778
Oh, one of the
fringe benefits of the job.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.113
Okay, Florence.
I think all the settings
are right.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.051
Oh, Louise, we're so
proud of you.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.253
Helen, you walked right
in front of the camera!

10:20.320 --> 10:21.789
Yeah, Miss Willis, watch out!

10:21.855 --> 10:24.591
Oh, Tom, why don't you
get everybody
in the picture?

10:24.658 --> 10:27.627
Oh, that's a good idea.
Come on, everybody.
Oh, Alan, over here.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.597
All right. Louise and Helen,
stand over here.
The light's better.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.765
Yeah.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.270
Hey, wait a minute.
I saved six months
for my dress.

10:37.337 --> 10:41.809
-I don't get it.
-No, no, no, Alan, move
a little more to your left.

10:43.343 --> 10:47.347
Louise, do you have your
acceptance speech ready?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.349
Well, just in case.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.318
-Oh, let's hear it.
-Okay.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.328
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm not sure that
I'm worthy of this award.

11:01.394 --> 11:05.298
But I am sure of one thing.
You're not getting it back.

11:07.167 --> 11:11.038
Louise, I'll take a picture
of you when you
accept your award.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.908
Oh! Oh, I wish I could
be sure as all of you.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.146
Weezy, don't worry about it.
There ain't no way
you can lose.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.649
But how can you
be so certain?

11:22.716 --> 11:26.787
-'Cause I got confidence
in you. You're the best.
-Oh, George.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.789
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got a little surprise
for you.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.457
Wait right here.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.760
Everybody ready?
Oh, oh, oh,
George, wait a minute.

11:32.826 --> 11:36.596
You know, I'm beginning
to believe it myself.
Maybe I will win.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.531
-Oh, Miss Jefferson...
-All right, everybody.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.301
(DOORBELL RINGS)

11:41.368 --> 11:43.603
-Uh, Florence, would you...
-Oh no, I ain't missing
out on the picture.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.044
Bentley, you're just
in time for the picture!

11:54.314 --> 11:59.486
Okay, everybody,
look at me.
Oh now, smile.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.556
Pretend you're all watching
Louise accept the award
from Councilman Perry.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.725
Oh, is that who's
presenting the award?

12:05.793 --> 12:07.394
Yes. Do you know him?

12:07.460 --> 12:10.798
Uh, no, but I bumped into
his campaign manager

12:10.864 --> 12:14.501
here in the elevator
last week.
A chap named Elliot Kane.

12:14.567 --> 12:19.606
Elliot Kane?
I thought he was
an insurance salesman.

12:19.672 --> 12:24.011
-Insurance salesman?
-Well, all I know is
when I came home,

12:24.077 --> 12:27.915
Elliot Kane was
leaving here
with 500 dollars.

12:30.750 --> 12:35.555
George gave Councilman
Perry's campaign manager
500 dollars?

12:35.622 --> 12:37.190
Yeah, he bought some
insurance from him.

12:38.926 --> 12:43.964
He did, did he?
Why that dirty little,
no good, scheming...

12:44.031 --> 12:46.266
Oh, no, actually
Mr. Kane seemed
quite pleasant.

12:48.601 --> 12:52.906
I'm talking about George.
He bought insurance,
all right.

12:52.973 --> 12:57.677
For 500 dollars
he got a policy that
made sure I'd win that award.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.513
Hey, look at these
flowers I got for my
award winning wife.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.150
George, you spoil everything!

13:16.496 --> 13:20.633
What the hell's
the matter with her?
Did the flowers smell bad?

13:20.700 --> 13:23.670
It ain't the flowers that
smell around here.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.576
Louise knows about
the bribe you gave
to Councilman Perry.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.179
-She does?
How'd she find out?
-So you admit it?

13:32.245 --> 13:35.015
-Poor Louise.
-Poor Louise?
She's gonna win.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.184
Yeah, but how much
did you have to pay for it?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.953
What do you care?
The money didn't
come out of your pocket.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.124
How could this happen?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.359
Yeah, how could
Mr. Jefferson
do such a thing?

13:46.426 --> 13:48.295
I mean, my camera.
The shutter's stuck.

13:52.232 --> 13:56.203
I'm not going, Helen.
Now would you
please unzip me?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.171
Weezy, what are you doing?
We're gonna be late
for the banquet!

13:58.238 --> 14:01.708
-I'm not going to the banquet.
-You gotta go.
You're the winner!

14:01.774 --> 14:04.211
-Some winner.
-Some husband.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.346
Take your hands off
my wife's zipper.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.515
Look, Weezy,
you got this all wrong.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.517
There's no reason
why you shouldn't
go to that banquet.

14:10.583 --> 14:15.455
I'll give you 500 reasons,
and they are all in
Councilman Perry's pocket!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.991
Lots of people gave money
to Perry's campaign.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.860
Lots of people
don't have wives
who are up for awards.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.729
What do you
expect her to do?

14:22.795 --> 14:25.265
Go down there and accept
the award when she knows
that you bought it?

14:25.332 --> 14:27.067
I know what
I expect you to do.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.102
I expect you to
get the hell out
of my bedroom.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.973
Wait! This is
my bedroom, too.
I want her to stay.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.943
Helen, would you please
unzip my dress?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.144
No.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.446
George, would you cut it out?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.014
Look, Weezy,
I'm taking you
to the banquet!

14:41.081 --> 14:42.849
You're not taking me
anywhere!

14:42.916 --> 14:45.818
Could y'all argue about
going to the banquet
after we get back?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.621
I got all dressed up
for tonight.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.758
See that, Weezy?
You spoiled the whole evening
for our wonderful maid.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.631
I spoiled it? You're the
one who paid the bribe.

14:58.698 --> 15:03.136
I fixed my camera, Louise!
Could I take a picture of you
in that beautiful dress?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.405
Tom, Louise is
getting undressed.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.873
Oh, excuse me.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.410
Hold it! Don't move, Willis.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.212
This is my bedroom, too,
and I want you to stay.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.047
Well, I don't wanna stay.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.783
I didn't buy this dress
to wear it in no bedroom!

15:16.849 --> 15:20.287
Then go wear it
in the living room!

15:20.353 --> 15:23.723
Well, if you're not gonna
let me undress in here,
I'll go in the bathroom.

15:23.790 --> 15:24.992
Hold it, Weezy,
you can't do that.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.126
Why not?

15:26.193 --> 15:27.927
Because...

15:27.995 --> 15:30.998
Because Bentley has to
use the bathroom.
Don't you, Bentley?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.966
-Well...
-See? I told you.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.739
George, why did you
bribe that man?

15:39.806 --> 15:42.976
Look, Weezy,
I didn't bribe nobody!
I just made a contribution.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.812
And what's the difference
between a bribe
and a contribution?

15:45.878 --> 15:49.516
Right. That's what I say.
What's the difference?
I mean, look at Willis here.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.918
Now he got this camera
as a bribe from an agent.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.387
It was not a bribe.
It was a gift.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.257
Uh-huh. Just like
the gift I gave
to Perry, right, Willis?

15:57.324 --> 15:58.525
Well, um...

15:58.591 --> 16:00.927
Oh, all you men
are just alike.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.263
Well, for your
information, Helen,

16:03.330 --> 16:06.066
the literary agent
who gave me
this camera is a woman!

16:06.133 --> 16:09.436
-Ha!
-Oh, really?

16:09.502 --> 16:10.903
A very old woman.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.043
-May I come out now?
-No!

16:18.211 --> 16:20.113
Look, Weezy, I'm telling you,
you've gotta go
to the banquet!

16:20.180 --> 16:22.049
That award's a big honor.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.218
-Too big for me to win it
on my own, right?
-Weezy, what...

16:25.285 --> 16:28.155
-George, you said
you had confidence in me.
-Well, yeah, but I...

16:28.221 --> 16:31.624
-You said you had
faith in my ability.
-Sure, I had faith.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.861
I just wanted to help it out
with a little charity.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.097
George, you're impossible.
Okay, okay, hold it.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.133
Okay. Is there anybody
in this room that
doesn't think that

16:40.200 --> 16:44.003
Louise deserves
that award more than
Agnes Simmons?

16:46.106 --> 16:48.408
See? All I did was make
a little contribution

16:48.475 --> 16:51.211
to a cause that
we all believe in.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.980
Forget it, George.
I am not going.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.449
Okay, if you won't go
get the award, I will.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.252
Well, go ahead.
You might as well get
your money's worth!

17:00.087 --> 17:01.354
(SIGHS)

17:25.044 --> 17:27.147
Excuse me.
Councilman Perry?

17:27.214 --> 17:31.384
Yes?
Oh, sorry I'm late.
Well, me, too. Mr...

17:31.451 --> 17:34.854
Jefferson.
George Jefferson.
Louise Jefferson's husband.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.956
Oh, of course.
Mr. Jefferson,

17:37.023 --> 17:39.392
I think your wife
is doing a wonderful job
at the Help Center.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.694
Oh, thank you.
Well, you know,
Louise is a lot like me.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.696
She likes to contribute
to a good cause.

17:43.763 --> 17:47.434
Oh. Well, well...
Where is Mrs. Jefferson?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.369
She couldn't make it tonight.
She's not feeling too good.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.937
Well, I hope
it's nothing serious.

17:51.003 --> 17:55.442
No, no. She just
had a little trouble
swallowing something.

17:55.508 --> 17:59.279
But I'm sure she'll feel
much better after
the award ceremonies, right?

17:59.346 --> 18:01.881
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

18:01.948 --> 18:05.652
Not a doctor.
That's a good one,
Councilman...

18:08.455 --> 18:11.958
Excuse me, Councilman,
I'll see if they can get
the ceremony started now.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.094
Uh, yes, Bill. Oh, Bill,
meet George Jefferson.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.930
George, this is Bill Davis.
My campaign manager.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.967
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Jefferson.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.202
Oh.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.139
Well, Councilman,
you must be running
a big campaign,

18:26.206 --> 18:27.807
using two campaign managers.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.176
Pardon?

18:29.242 --> 18:31.444
Oh, I mean, Mr. Davis,
and Elliot Kane.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.781
Elliot Kane? Oh, he's
not with me anymore.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.750
-Say what?
-I let him go a month ago.
He was a crook.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.186
What do you mean?

18:39.252 --> 18:43.190
Kane was pocketing
the money that he collected
for my campaign.

18:43.256 --> 18:47.694
He would tell people
to make their
checks out to cash.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.731
Would you believe that
some people were
foolish enough to do it?

19:00.507 --> 19:01.608
Weezy!

19:04.844 --> 19:06.579
Weezy, what are
you doing here?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.249
You'll find out.

19:09.316 --> 19:14.721
And now to present the
Volunteer of the Year award,
Councilman Edward Perry.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.359
Weezy, I wanna
talk to you
about the award.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.060
I don't wanna hear it.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.863
Thank you.
It's an honor to be here
to present an award

19:23.930 --> 19:27.033
to one of two deserving women.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.868
Agnes Simmons,

19:28.935 --> 19:31.238
-and Louise Jefferson,
who because of
illness will not...

19:31.304 --> 19:33.206
(CLEARING THROAT)
My wife just got better.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.007
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson is here.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.509
Yes! Yes!

19:39.246 --> 19:40.713
(COUNCILMAN CLEARS THROAT)

19:45.685 --> 19:50.423
After carefully considering
the qualifications of both
candidates for this award...

19:50.490 --> 19:51.891
-Look, Weezy,
will you listen to me?
-Shh!

19:51.958 --> 19:55.262
The hard work,
the long hours of
volunteer service...

19:55.328 --> 19:57.129
-The five hundred dollars.
-Shh!

19:57.196 --> 20:00.433
And the endless
dedication to duty,
it's my pleasure

20:00.500 --> 20:03.202
to present the Volunteer
of the Year award to...

20:03.270 --> 20:05.137
Look, Weezy,
if you don't win,
it ain't my fault.

20:05.204 --> 20:11.344
-Louise Jefferson!
-Hey! Weezy! You did it.
You won! Yay!

20:11.411 --> 20:13.746
Of course I won, George.
Don't you think
you're overdoing it?

20:13.813 --> 20:15.582
Look, Weezy...
No, I mean,
you really won.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.184
-George, I'm giving the award
to Agnes Simmons.
-(YELLS) What?

20:18.251 --> 20:20.052
Congratulations, Louise.

20:20.119 --> 20:24.056
Uh, thank you,
Councilman. But I really
can't accept this award...

20:24.123 --> 20:27.660
What my wife means is
she can't accept this award,

20:27.727 --> 20:31.498
because she is
too choked up to talk.
So I'll talk for her.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.500
-George...
-That's all right, darling...

20:36.336 --> 20:40.407
First, I'd like to say
a few things about
that great statesman,

20:40.473 --> 20:43.776
-Councilman Robert Perry!
-That's Edward.

20:43.843 --> 20:47.647
Oh, right. Councilman
Edward Robert Perry!

20:51.217 --> 20:53.653
Now, I know a lot of you think
that you can buy favors

20:53.720 --> 20:57.156
from politicians
by contributing
to their campaign fund,

20:57.223 --> 21:01.294
-but that is not true
with honest Ed Perry.
-George...

21:01.361 --> 21:05.765
Look, let me talk, Weez.
Now, I'd also like
to congratulate

21:05.832 --> 21:11.671
Councilman Perry's
new campaign manager,
honest Bill Davis,

21:11.738 --> 21:15.308
who I never met
before tonight,
have I, Bill? Right.

21:17.644 --> 21:22.281
Honest Bill has been
working for Honest Ed
for the past month.

21:22.349 --> 21:27.720
Which is when
Councilman Perry fired
his old campaign manager,

21:27.787 --> 21:30.657
some turkey named Elliot Kane.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.127
-Am I right?
-That's right.

21:35.194 --> 21:39.632
Now, to receive the award
which Councilman Perry
decided she should get,

21:39.699 --> 21:43.235
because she deserves it,
and not because of
nothing else,

21:43.302 --> 21:47.807
like a campaign contribution,
which he never got,
my wife, Louise.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.844
Nice try, George.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.449
Look, Weez,
you won the award
fair and square!

21:56.516 --> 21:59.018
That still doesn't excuse
what you tried to do.

21:59.085 --> 22:02.121
-Uh...
-Oh! And one more thing...

22:05.257 --> 22:11.531
My fellow Americans,
I believe in my country.

22:11.598 --> 22:17.036
And I believe that love is
what made this great country
the nation it is today.

22:22.241 --> 22:26.212
A man loving his wife,
and wanting to make
her happy,

22:26.278 --> 22:29.582
is what this great nation
of ours is built on!

22:30.349 --> 22:31.784
It's the American way!

22:37.289 --> 22:40.026
Even when a man does
something wrong,

22:40.092 --> 22:43.696
trying to make his wife happy,
his wife should
try to understand

22:43.763 --> 22:46.499
that he only did it
because he loves her!

22:49.536 --> 22:51.170
And if she
can't understand that,

22:51.237 --> 22:56.609
then the only thing left
for the man to do is to
say he's sorry. Uh-huh.

22:59.245 --> 23:02.715
He's sorry that his wife
does not understand.

23:02.782 --> 23:06.619
And that is what keeps
America free!

23:08.020 --> 23:09.822
Thank you, Mr. Jefferson...

23:09.889 --> 23:13.560
-That is their right!
-Now, I believe your wife
would like to say something.

23:15.728 --> 23:19.799
I'd like to tell you
something about my husband.

23:19.866 --> 23:24.336
He tried to make this
one of the happiest
nights of my life,

23:25.705 --> 23:27.073
and it is.

23:31.844 --> 23:36.282
However, I do want
to share this award
with Agnes Simmons,

23:36.348 --> 23:40.319
-who deserves it
as much as I do.
-Oh, Weezy...

23:43.222 --> 23:48.661
And finally, I'd like to
thank my husband
who has shown me

23:48.728 --> 23:52.632
there is more than one way
to say, "I love you."

24:35.775 --> 24:40.379

videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
