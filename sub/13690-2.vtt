(HECTOR HUMMING)

00:37.485 --> 00:39.571
-Anything for me?
-I fear not.

00:39.654 --> 00:41.406
What about that?
It's from the bank, look.

00:41.489 --> 00:43.409
Yes, but it's addressed to me.

00:43.492 --> 00:45.244
See.
Hector N MacDonald, Esquire.

00:45.327 --> 00:47.121
It must be estate business.

00:48.832 --> 00:50.292
I had hoped
the New World Order

00:50.375 --> 00:53.295
might allow a chap
to open
his own correspondence.

(DOOR OPENING)

01:57.036 --> 01:58.621
Tell me, boy,

01:58.704 --> 02:01.583
do you count
packing suitcases
as your very favourite hobby?

02:03.126 --> 02:04.211
(GROANING)

02:04.294 --> 02:06.089
Are you in pain?

02:06.172 --> 02:07.882
It's my back.

02:07.966 --> 02:10.342
If I'm gonna stay,
you'll have to do
something about that mattress.

02:10.425 --> 02:12.179
It's like a sack
of King Edwards.

02:12.263 --> 02:16.267
Right. Of course.
So, you're staying on?

02:16.350 --> 02:18.270
No.

02:18.353 --> 02:22.649
Well, yes. Just for a while.
Just to straighten
a few things out, okay?

02:22.732 --> 02:24.110
I think so.

02:24.193 --> 02:26.779
But, Archie, if you're
staying, why are you going?

02:26.863 --> 02:28.698
To talk things
over with Justine

02:28.781 --> 02:31.702
and work out how we're gonna
manage the restaurant
in the meantime.

02:31.785 --> 02:35.622
I feel sorry for Justine
but I'm glad for our sakes.
Well, we're both glad.

02:35.706 --> 02:36.749
Aren't we, Hector?

02:36.833 --> 02:38.751
(GRUNTING)

02:38.835 --> 02:40.920
I still believe
the only long term option
is to sell the place.

02:41.004 --> 02:42.631
Now look here...

02:42.714 --> 02:44.717
We'll get a much better price
if we straighten
out the accounts

02:44.799 --> 02:48.346
and start capitalising
on some of our primary assets.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.098
So what did he say?

02:50.182 --> 02:52.726
That the estate needed
every asset it had,

02:52.809 --> 02:54.770
that they couldn't afford
to give land away.

02:54.854 --> 02:57.857
Maybe later when he'd had
a chance to think about it,
blah, blah, blah.

02:57.940 --> 03:01.737
-No land, no new gymnasium.
-For the time being anyway.

03:01.820 --> 03:05.199
Oh, what a shame.
It's just a piece
of old pasture.

03:05.282 --> 03:06.951
I'm disappointed in the laird.

03:07.035 --> 03:08.620
I wish you wouldn't
call him that.

03:08.703 --> 03:11.789
Sometimes I think
you do it deliberately.
I'm off training.

03:11.874 --> 03:13.584
I'll see you after break.

03:13.667 --> 03:16.337
And has the laird
put his name down
for the hill race?

03:16.420 --> 03:19.007
I don't know and I don't care.

03:19.090 --> 03:22.510
This is one race
I'm going to win
without his permission.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.392
Duncan.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.270
I thought it
was a character in
The Godfather there.

03:30.354 --> 03:32.356
-Hello, Lexie.
-What are you doing?

03:32.439 --> 03:34.566
Your very
hilarious bat impression?

03:34.650 --> 03:37.278
Training for the race.
Watch this.

03:38.071 --> 03:40.782
I can do 50 of these.

03:40.865 --> 03:43.994
Your body's compensating
for the lack of
muscle elsewhere.

03:44.078 --> 03:46.288
And I'm not just
talking about your brain.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.960
What's happening?

03:50.043 --> 03:52.629
Well,
he's stopping and he's going.

03:53.629 --> 03:55.715
Eh?

03:55.800 --> 03:58.427
Well, he's going to London
for a spot of conjugal
with this Justine bint,

03:58.511 --> 04:00.347
and then he's coming back
here to sort things out,

04:00.430 --> 04:02.849
which probably means
giving us all the push.

04:05.269 --> 04:09.274
Well, don't just stand there.
His Gorgeousness
will be wanting a lift.

04:09.357 --> 04:10.608
Oh, aye.

04:16.740 --> 04:18.159
Duncan!

04:30.632 --> 04:31.717
Right.

04:35.387 --> 04:38.182
-Duncan.
-HECTOR: Hang on.

04:40.935 --> 04:43.022
Off to wage war.

04:43.105 --> 04:45.608

would you?

06:48.877 --> 06:51.755
-Afternoon.
-Where can I get a taxi?

06:51.838 --> 06:54.967
-Inverness'd be your best bet.
-That's rather inconvenient.

06:55.051 --> 06:56.344
Where are you going?

06:56.427 --> 06:58.888

live there, I live in...

-And you are?
-Fleming. I represent

Why don't we do Waterloo?
I could be Napoleon.

We've never fought Agincourt.

07:34.930 --> 07:38.935

-No.

Please, Kilwillie. Culloden.

You can be
Bonnie Prince Charlie,
I shall be Butcher Cumberland.

07:54.203 --> 07:55.913
Oh, I'm always
Bonnie Prince Charlie.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.416
That's because you're rather
corpulent and fond
of the sauce.

07:58.499 --> 08:00.711
Come, to battle.

08:00.794 --> 08:05.299
It is a misty, damp morning
on the desolate
moor of Culloden.

they're very friendly.

08:31.955 --> 08:35.207

It's just their
way of saying hello.

They're perfectly friendly

08:42.676 --> 08:46.221
Anyway, as I was saying,
there's a lot of interesting
history about this house.

08:46.305 --> 08:48.767
My great-great-grandfather
built the place in the 1870s,

08:48.850 --> 08:51.269
but there'd been
a castle here before that.

08:51.352 --> 08:53.731
And Queen Victoria
came to stay once,

08:53.813 --> 08:56.941
but apparently she caught
a cold and had to leave
rather quickly.

08:57.026 --> 08:59.111
My family have been
here for 400 years.

08:59.195 --> 09:01.406
I'm sure the early chiefs
were utter rogues but...

09:01.490 --> 09:05.578
Mr MacDonald, you're obviously
confusing me with somebody who
does give a monkeys.

09:05.662 --> 09:07.538
I'm not a tripper
or a tourist,

09:07.622 --> 09:10.166
or a loud American
in tartan trousers from Omaha.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.919
I am a banker

09:12.002 --> 09:14.505
who drew a very short
straw and travelled
a ridiculous distance

09:14.588 --> 09:17.676
to conduct an even
smaller piece of business.

09:17.759 --> 09:22.639
It seems at the cost
of a very expensive
pair of Boston loafers.

09:22.722 --> 09:26.352
Now can you
please call your father
so we can get it over with?

09:26.435 --> 09:28.479
Maybe we should
go to the library.

09:32.442 --> 09:35.153
Lexie.
Lexie, I know you're there.

09:38.324 --> 09:40.034
Who's your friend?

09:40.118 --> 09:42.830
-What's he in
such a strop for?
-I want tea in the library.

09:42.913 --> 09:45.499
Two people,
nice china, bits to eat.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.185
I presume your
visit's related to
our indebtedness at the bank.

10:02.269 --> 10:06.190
To a defaulted loan and
a breached
overdraft limit, yes.

10:06.274 --> 10:09.861
Mr Fleming,
I'd like to talk to you
about my plans for the future.

10:09.944 --> 10:13.115
You see, I own the estate now.

10:13.198 --> 10:17.369
I have to tell you that
as from Monday your family's
accounts will be suspended,

10:17.453 --> 10:19.414
the bank will then
proceed to call in the loan.

10:19.497 --> 10:22.042
You must find
the funds to repay it,

10:22.125 --> 10:25.713
I presume by selling
whatever assets you possess.

10:25.796 --> 10:27.632
Well,
the estate is all we have.

10:28.299 --> 10:30.302
So be it.

10:30.385 --> 10:34.014
Mr Fleming,
my mother and father
can't leave here.

10:36.643 --> 10:39.270
I don't seem to be
making myself understood.

10:40.897 --> 10:44.234
Let me put it to you in
words of one syllable.

10:44.318 --> 10:46.654
I'm here to close you down.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.559
That is for
the nice gentleman.

11:12.643 --> 11:15.771
If you're hungry,
get yourself some
bread and dripping.

11:18.066 --> 11:21.194
Here we are, tea up.

11:21.278 --> 11:25.950
And you must be our
very important guest.
Mr Fleming, is it?

11:26.033 --> 11:27.618
Well, I've got an uncle
called Fleming.

11:27.702 --> 11:29.705
You're not from Paisley,
are you?

11:29.788 --> 11:34.251
I live in Ealing.
Well, well, West Ealing.
Almost as far as Hanwell.

11:34.334 --> 11:37.547
My, that sounds complicated.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.967
-Yes, thank you very much...
-Well, you look like
a man with a big appetite

11:41.050 --> 11:43.178
so I've brought you
a few things to
get your teeth into.

11:43.262 --> 11:47.601
-Some pancakes and
drop scones and that.
-All freshly baked, I hope.

11:47.684 --> 11:50.395
Well, they were when
they left the factory.

11:50.478 --> 11:52.564
No, all home baked.

11:52.647 --> 11:56.235
Anyway, well, Mr Fleming.
Oh heck, this is no good.

11:56.319 --> 11:59.322
-What's your first name?
-Me?

11:59.406 --> 12:01.575
I'm not cross-eyed, pet.

12:01.658 --> 12:05.162
I am looking into
your deep blue eyes.

12:05.245 --> 12:08.041
(STAMMERING) I
couldn't possibly say.

12:08.124 --> 12:10.335
Oh, man of mystery, eh?

12:10.418 --> 12:13.505
Well,
I'll wheedle it out of you
one way or the other.

12:13.589 --> 12:17.719
Anyway,
I'm away to get one of those
13 spare rooms ready for you.

12:17.802 --> 12:21.139
One of the better ones.
Well, one that's been
slept in in the last century.

12:21.222 --> 12:23.476
But I-I
couldn't possibly stay.

12:23.559 --> 12:26.270
Oh, what happened
to your slip-on?

12:27.939 --> 12:31.985
Oh, your poor wee tassel.

12:32.069 --> 12:34.780
Let me look at it for you.

12:34.863 --> 12:37.325
Come on, trust me.

12:49.589 --> 12:51.424
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

12:52.509 --> 12:54.136
I'll tell you what I'll do,

12:54.220 --> 12:57.848
I'll get
the estate's resident cobbler
to fix it for you, okay?

13:03.146 --> 13:05.733
Now you'll have
to stay, won't you?

13:09.362 --> 13:10.822
Who was that?

13:10.905 --> 13:12.950
Oh, that was Lexie.

13:13.033 --> 13:16.245
She kind of runs the place.
Tea?

13:19.165 --> 13:23.253
Ah. Thanks for the game,
Kilwillie,
I really enjoyed it.

13:23.337 --> 13:26.632
-Not very surprising, you won.
-Of course I did.

13:26.716 --> 13:28.592
Where would we be
if Bonnie Prince Charlie

13:28.676 --> 13:30.554
suddenly started winning
the Battle of Culloden?

13:30.637 --> 13:32.806
Living in a country that
had been independent

13:32.889 --> 13:34.933
for two and a half centuries
probably.

13:35.017 --> 13:37.103
What an appalling thought.

13:50.035 --> 13:51.870
MOLLY: But who is he, Archie?

13:51.953 --> 13:54.999
Someone very powerful, Mother.
Someone who could
turn us all out of here.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.543
What's he doing, Lexie?

13:57.627 --> 14:00.088
Some personal grooming.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.840
Right, here's what
we have to do.

14:01.923 --> 14:04.635
We have to persuade him,
seduce him.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.430
Oh, aye? And who's
gonna do that, then?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.059
Is there something
wrong with your jaw?

14:11.142 --> 14:13.687
ARCHIE: Make him see
that this is
a place with potential.

14:13.771 --> 14:17.609
That we can put it back
on its feet and his bank's
money is safe with us.

14:17.692 --> 14:19.569
What do you want
us to do, then?

14:19.653 --> 14:21.905
Do? Yes, do.

14:22.489 --> 14:23.783
Erm...

14:25.242 --> 14:26.369
Well...

14:29.456 --> 14:31.917
I'll make a presentation.
Yes, he'll like that.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.795
A presentation about how
we're gonna develop the place.

14:34.878 --> 14:38.007
Golly, you and Duncan
show him the estate.

14:38.091 --> 14:41.010
Give him some sport,
make sure he catches
something really big, okay?

14:41.094 --> 14:43.764
But I've got my final
training for the hill race.

14:43.847 --> 14:47.142
Mother,
maybe you could give him
a tour of the house.

14:47.226 --> 14:49.646
Or I wonder if he's
interested in gardening?

14:49.729 --> 14:51.690
I'm desperately in
need of some help.

14:51.773 --> 14:55.861
And you, Lexie,
just be nice to him, okay?

14:55.945 --> 14:59.908
Yes, O Master.
He shall be as
putty in my windows.

14:59.992 --> 15:02.494
Yeah,
and it'll be curtains for him
if he doesn't mind out.

15:02.577 --> 15:04.788
There,
Nancy boy's shoes all done.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.541
But the most important thing,
all of you,

15:06.624 --> 15:08.835
is we must keep him away
from my father.

15:08.918 --> 15:11.505
From now on we must make sure
that he's never on his own,

15:11.588 --> 15:14.425
that he can't be got at
by the old man because that
could be disastrous.

15:14.508 --> 15:15.884
Archie.

15:19.556 --> 15:20.724
Oh, no.

15:26.564 --> 15:27.940
HECTOR: Hey, you!

15:28.858 --> 15:31.361
Yes, you. Take the painter.

15:31.445 --> 15:32.529
The what?

15:32.612 --> 15:35.783
The rope, you dolt.

15:35.867 --> 15:38.619
HECTOR: Hold on, hold on.
Come on, man. Over there.

15:38.703 --> 15:40.496
What's the matter with you?

15:44.168 --> 15:46.086
You can let go now.

15:48.173 --> 15:50.967
-Thanks,
Kilwillie, off you go.
-Bye, old man.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.305
Next time I'll grind you
into the dust at Bull Run.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.806
(LAUGHING)

15:59.519 --> 16:02.564
-One of those Water
Board bods, are you?
-Pardon?

16:02.648 --> 16:06.319
What is it this time?
Measuring acid rain
or some such nonsense?

16:06.402 --> 16:09.697
-You must be Hector MacDonald.
-"Sir" to you.

16:09.781 --> 16:12.117
You chaps have
such a comfy billet

16:12.201 --> 16:15.371
while the likes
of me pay for it.

16:15.454 --> 16:18.625
As far as I can see,
Mr MacDonald,
you pay for very little.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.377
What did you say?

16:20.460 --> 16:22.629
I'll take my foot
to your tradesman's entrance
in a minute.

16:22.712 --> 16:24.632
Father!

16:24.715 --> 16:27.593
I don't work for
the Water Board.
I represent your bank.

16:27.677 --> 16:30.639
I thought it was
going downhill.
Some kind of clerk, are you?

16:30.722 --> 16:32.182
Account executive.

16:32.265 --> 16:34.351
I have written
to you repeatedly
in the last six months

16:34.434 --> 16:36.062
regarding your
very serious position.

16:36.145 --> 16:38.398
-You never replied.
-Of course not.

16:38.481 --> 16:40.483
I have learnt
through bitter experience

16:40.566 --> 16:44.238
that acknowledging
the pettifogging outpourings
of pen-pushing nobodies

16:44.321 --> 16:48.702
is unlikely to increase
the sum of human happiness.
Mine especially!

16:48.785 --> 16:51.579
Mr MacDonald,
you are a very rude man.

16:51.663 --> 16:53.207
And you,
sir, are a very dull one.

16:53.290 --> 16:56.210
-You are also drunk.
-But I shall be
sober in the morning.

16:56.293 --> 16:59.088
Anyway, it's my prerogative.
You are standing on my land.

16:59.172 --> 17:01.299
Not for very much
longer I'm happy to say.

17:01.383 --> 17:03.760
Mr Fleming,
take no notice of my father.

17:03.844 --> 17:05.179
I'm going to my room.

17:05.262 --> 17:06.931
I shall be obliged
if you could have

17:07.015 --> 17:09.224
a cheese sandwich
and a glass of milk
sent up to me later.

17:09.308 --> 17:10.727
Won't you join us for dinner?

17:10.810 --> 17:13.439
I shall inspect
your books and accounts
tomorrow morning.

17:13.521 --> 17:17.108
We can resolve any
outstanding business
shortly after that.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.994
(CHUCKLING) That showed him.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.916
Doesn't do to let these
fellows get the upper hand,
you know, Archie.

17:42.556 --> 17:44.266
Are you okay, Dougal?

17:44.350 --> 17:48.563
I wanted to give you this.
To make you smell nice.

17:48.646 --> 17:52.275
I hope you mean to
make me smell even nicer.

17:52.357 --> 17:54.570
Did you buy this
with your own money?

17:54.653 --> 17:57.823
No,
my mum got it for Christmas
but she doesn't like it.

17:57.907 --> 17:59.534
I love you, Miss.

18:11.005 --> 18:13.759
Look, I'll...
I'll do you a deal.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.178
You can have
the land for that gym thing.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.681
Go on.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.767
Well, the thing is...

18:21.768 --> 18:23.562
What are you doing tonight?

18:23.646 --> 18:26.941
Well, I was gonna worm the dog
but I guess it'll keep.

18:29.068 --> 18:30.737
KATRINA:
I suppose it was
Golly told you

18:30.821 --> 18:33.073
I could cook books
better than a boiled egg?

18:33.156 --> 18:34.533
No comment.

18:40.707 --> 18:42.835
This is going to take hours.

18:42.918 --> 18:44.753
It's very good of you.

18:44.837 --> 18:47.298
As long as you keep
your side of the bargain.

18:47.382 --> 18:49.884
I've given you
the word of a MacDonald.

18:51.344 --> 18:52.929
Very reassuring.

19:13.495 --> 19:15.456
Oh, showing me your
best side, are you?

19:19.002 --> 19:21.087
(STAMMERING) I was just, er...

19:21.171 --> 19:23.424
Is that a pair of M&amp;S slacks
in your hand

19:23.507 --> 19:25.217
or are you just pleased
to see me?

19:25.301 --> 19:28.929
They're wet.
I was trying to turn
the radiator on to dry them.

19:29.013 --> 19:32.392
LEXIE: Ah, yes.
Now the heating doesn't
come on till the first frost,

19:32.476 --> 19:36.230
or the 1st of September,
whichever comes sooner.

19:36.314 --> 19:38.358
Give me,
I'll sort them for you.

19:42.946 --> 19:45.657
I take it you're not dining
with the Addams
family tonight, then?

19:45.741 --> 19:48.119
-Definitely not.
-Shame.

19:48.203 --> 19:50.413
You're missing out
on some rare fun.

19:52.165 --> 19:54.126
Oh, and thank you.

19:54.210 --> 19:57.963
You have shone a bright light
into the dull
drabness of my day.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.509
I have?

20:00.592 --> 20:04.513
There is no sight sweeter,
more pregnant with
pathos and vulnerability,

20:04.596 --> 20:08.935
than a slender-legged gadgie
standing in his wee
Y-fronts and socks.

20:09.018 --> 20:10.228
Night-night.

20:26.747 --> 20:30.794
Archie, you know,
these are just total rubbish.

20:30.877 --> 20:34.047
Oh, be fair, they're
probably not as good as that.

20:34.131 --> 20:36.968
-I'm doing my best, okay?
-I'm grateful.

20:40.930 --> 20:43.976
You trained for this
sort of thing originally?

20:44.059 --> 20:48.231
When I first left university,
I went to work for
a bank in Edinburgh.

20:48.314 --> 20:51.317
Small business advisor.

20:51.401 --> 20:56.240
I had some great clients.
A man who gelded horses,

20:56.323 --> 20:58.784
two brothers who
made Italian ice cream,

21:00.078 --> 21:02.998
and a very refined
lady from Morningside

21:03.081 --> 21:05.251
who ran
a personal therapy centre.

21:05.334 --> 21:07.920
-Oh, yeah?
-She offered me a job.

21:08.004 --> 21:09.464
Is that right?

21:09.547 --> 21:12.760
As her business manager,
smarty-pants.

21:12.843 --> 21:14.595
And you didn't take it?

21:14.678 --> 21:17.223
Those girls'd be
earning twice as much as me.

21:17.307 --> 21:21.728
I'd have found
that very irritating,
not to say tempting.

21:21.811 --> 21:24.106
So you became a teacher
and came back here.

21:24.190 --> 21:26.233
What on earth made
you do that?

21:28.569 --> 21:31.615
I just felt maybe I
could make a difference.
Simple as that.

21:31.698 --> 21:34.409
Miss Jean Brodie.
You're in your prime.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.913
Don't patronise me,
Archie MacDonald.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.332
I'm not, I envy you.

21:39.415 --> 21:42.211
You seem so certain, so sure.

21:43.337 --> 21:44.505
Do I?

21:47.384 --> 21:49.677
I don't know what
the hell I'm doing.

21:56.727 --> 22:00.732
So, you're going to
make a presentation
to this guy, are you?

22:05.405 --> 22:07.907
-You toe rag!
-What?

22:07.990 --> 22:11.704
-Increase rents on
land and properties?
-It's just an idea.

22:11.787 --> 22:13.747
A way we might
increase our revenue.

22:13.831 --> 22:16.083
So far as I can see,
rents haven't
gone up in years.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.002
For a very good reason.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.046
People couldn't
afford to pay them.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.382
It's just for this man
Fleming, nothing definite.

22:22.465 --> 22:24.009
You would say that, though,
wouldn't you?

22:24.093 --> 22:26.595
Until you got what
you wanted from me.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.850
What am I doing here? I'm off.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.228
What, leave me in the lurch,
would you?

22:33.311 --> 22:35.773
Oh, you'll survive.
Your sort always do.

22:35.857 --> 22:37.984
My sort? Katrina...

22:38.067 --> 22:40.027
Once a landlord,
always a landlord.

22:40.111 --> 22:42.823
You spent too much time
with that personal therapist.

22:42.906 --> 22:44.992
Gave you a wrong
slant on human nature.

22:45.075 --> 22:48.121
And you can kiss goodbye
to that bit of land, too.

23:38.096 --> 23:40.807
It's not an original.

23:40.891 --> 23:44.269
That's in the National
Gallery in Edinburgh now.

23:44.353 --> 23:47.857
Hector had a copy made
when he flogged the other one.

23:47.941 --> 23:49.818
It paid for
the central heating.

23:51.528 --> 23:53.948
Sometimes I think
I'd rather be cold.

23:54.865 --> 23:56.742
She's very beautiful.

24:00.038 --> 24:04.376
Ancestor. Died in
childbirth when she was 27.

24:07.296 --> 24:09.632
Nightshirt okay
for you, is it?

24:13.053 --> 24:18.143
My, Lady Catherine's made
quite an impression
on you, hasn't she?

24:20.562 --> 24:22.480
She reminds me of my mother.

24:26.694 --> 24:28.696
Better get off to bed.

24:30.198 --> 24:31.575
Long day.

24:33.076 --> 24:34.996
I'll say good night, then.

24:37.290 --> 24:41.503
Oh, it's two short pulls
and one long one, by the way.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.256
The lavvy.

24:50.847 --> 24:54.477
So that's it. I can't
leave while he's here.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.145
But I'll be down soon.

24:58.147 --> 25:00.067
You're not saying very much.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.443
What's there to say?

25:01.526 --> 25:03.695
I mean,
you're taking it very calmly.

25:03.779 --> 25:06.240
What do you want me
to do, get hysterical?

25:07.617 --> 25:09.494
I wish you'd say something.

25:11.121 --> 25:12.414
Justine?

25:15.125 --> 25:17.837
Maybe we should think about
hiring a temporary manager?

25:17.921 --> 25:19.047
No.

25:19.130 --> 25:20.840
Just to tide things over.

25:20.924 --> 25:24.261
Archie, I have to cope
while you're off doing
your Mel Gibson thing.

25:24.345 --> 25:27.807
I'd rather I didn't but,
hey, it's a tough world.

25:27.890 --> 25:30.018
And I'll manage in my own way,
thank you very much,

25:30.102 --> 25:33.563
without the benefit
of your distant and
rather fatuous advice.

25:33.647 --> 25:35.691
Maybe we should
talk about this later.

25:35.775 --> 25:38.653
Yes, later.
And then some more.

25:38.736 --> 25:40.696
-Okay.
-Okay.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.203
Men.

25:46.286 --> 25:49.457
Sometimes you have to wipe
their bottoms, sometimes you
have to kick them.

26:19.159 --> 26:21.786
Good morning.
I hope you slept well.

26:21.870 --> 26:24.331
I heard animals in the night.

26:24.415 --> 26:26.250
Grunting, howling.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.127
Probably just my father.

26:32.132 --> 26:36.220
(STAMMERING) I
brought the books.

26:36.304 --> 26:40.349
Perhaps later you'd like
to look around the estate,
maybe try some sport.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.561
These will take all day.

26:42.644 --> 26:46.398
Anyway, I have
the beginnings of a cold.

26:46.482 --> 26:49.068
Well, if there's anything
you need, please shout.

26:50.904 --> 26:54.867
Look, I'm in business myself
and I know that the accounts

26:54.950 --> 26:57.286
aren't all they should be.

26:58.663 --> 27:00.582
I'm grieved to hear it.

27:21.481 --> 27:22.691
Well?

27:22.775 --> 27:25.277
Eight seconds down on Monday.

27:25.361 --> 27:26.862
Are you all right?

27:26.946 --> 27:29.074
I didn't sleep
too well last night.

You are carrying the hopes

The first time ever that
women have entered
the Glenbogle Hill Race.

27:38.417 --> 27:41.130
Another nail in
the coffin of patriarchy.

27:41.213 --> 27:43.048
Me and my big mouth.

27:43.132 --> 27:45.551
But I have complete
faith in you, Katrina.

27:45.634 --> 27:49.722
You go and win it, dear.
Win it for all the sisters.
Yes!

fresh out of the river,

28:53.130 --> 28:55.174
and new potatoes
from Golly's garden,

in a plain white sauce.

-I mean it,

You can enter my

when it comes to scones,
you are an artist.

29:21.037 --> 29:22.330
Thanks.

29:22.413 --> 29:24.875
-You'll be
staying to dinner, then?
-How can I refuse?

29:24.959 --> 29:27.628
-I was wondering
about my trousers.
-Oh, yes.

29:30.549 --> 29:32.467
Cleaned and pressed.

29:33.176 --> 29:34.554
Thank you.

Oh, why thank you, kind sir.
It's nice to be appreciated.

-Have you told him, Mother?
-Yes.

29:53.117 --> 29:55.369
-And he knows what's expected?
-Of course.

29:55.453 --> 29:57.288
Will he behave himself?

Okay, okay.

Ah, good evening.
I hope you're hungry.

30:18.229 --> 30:20.106
This is delicious. What is it?

30:20.190 --> 30:23.068
Nettle and raspberry soup
with a sprinkling
of Orkney cheese.

30:23.152 --> 30:25.571
Oh. Will I get stung?

30:28.073 --> 30:30.410
You said it, pal.

of the pattern left on that
if you don't mind.

saying about the books.

30:56.357 --> 30:58.442
The books? The books, yes.

30:58.527 --> 31:00.237
Yes, well, they're very good.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.698
They convey
a very accurate picture
of the enterprise.

31:03.782 --> 31:07.161
-Yes,
I was rather afraid of that.
-Which is,

31:07.245 --> 31:09.372
if the Glenbogle estate
were a wet dog,

31:09.455 --> 31:11.834
to take your analogy,
Mr MacDonald,

31:11.917 --> 31:14.002
the most humane
course of action

31:14.086 --> 31:15.963
would be to rub it down
with an old towel

31:16.046 --> 31:17.507
and shoot the mutt.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.768
-How's it going?
-All right.

31:27.852 --> 31:31.189
These are for
Molly and Hector.
You get the others.

31:31.273 --> 31:33.650
Which one's his?
The gowk in the suit.

31:33.733 --> 31:36.195
Oh, that one there.
The biggest portion.

I can't disagree with you.

31:52.255 --> 31:54.383
I run my own business...
Did I mention that?

31:54.467 --> 31:59.764
And I know that this estate
hasn't been run on
very professional lines.

31:59.848 --> 32:03.101
That's all right,
chaps, don't mind me.
Just pretend I don't exist.

32:03.185 --> 32:07.023

there is something here
worth fighting for.

a plain white sauce.
-Lovely.

32:17.452 --> 32:19.078
Sorry, you were saying.

32:19.162 --> 32:23.334
I... We have great plans
for developing Glenbogle.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.836

making it prosper.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.381
But how could you
possibly generate the income?

We have all sorts of ideas.

the aged residents
of this fantastic old house?

-Hector.
-Your father obviously
doesn't share your vision.

Mr Fleming, not my father.

it's not gonna happen.

At least not with
my bank's money.

I'm faster than you.
Sassenachs beaten again.

47:08.491 --> 47:11.286
-I'm as Scottish as you are.
-Ha! You Scottish?

47:12.537 --> 47:13.830
Katrina!

47:17.585 --> 47:20.296
-Katrina, are you all right?
-I'm fine.

47:22.758 --> 47:25.552
-Come on.
-Go on, you can still win.

47:33.896 --> 47:35.189
MAN: That's it.

47:40.278 --> 47:43.615
Jolly sporting of the boy.
His ancestors would
have been proud of him.

47:43.699 --> 47:45.367
Yes, it was a good show.

47:57.799 --> 48:00.760
ANNOUNCER: The winner of
this year's
Glenbogle Hill Race.

48:00.844 --> 48:02.262
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

48:03.555 --> 48:05.766
Welcome to Planet Glenbogle.

48:24.913 --> 48:27.458
Nice one, Duncan.
Shame about the costume.

48:33.966 --> 48:35.635
Well done.

48:35.718 --> 48:38.638
And the winner
of the women's race,
and equal second,

48:38.721 --> 48:40.307
Katrina Finlay.

48:46.189 --> 48:47.523
Well done.

48:50.443 --> 48:53.739
Oh, and by the way, Katrina,
you can have that
land for the school.

48:53.822 --> 48:55.032
(ALL CHEERING)

48:57.117 --> 48:59.162
Thank you very much, Archie.

48:59.245 --> 49:02.916
And we weren't
equal second by the way.
I crossed the line first.

49:03.876 --> 49:05.211
It's a mere technicality.

49:07.755 --> 49:09.966
Well done, Arch.

49:10.050 --> 49:13.011
Now listen,
Lexie, can I just say sorry?
I don't really want you to go.

49:13.095 --> 49:14.471
Oh, I'm not going anywhere,
boy.

49:14.554 --> 49:17.558
Now hush your mouth
and give us a kiss.

49:21.396 --> 49:25.693
Give him a kiss, girls.
Go on. Lovely.

49:25.776 --> 49:27.152
And again.

49:29.698 --> 49:31.074
Thank you.

49:34.120 --> 49:35.496
Justine.

49:35.579 --> 49:38.165
Well, you've kissed virtually
every woman in Scotland.

49:38.249 --> 49:40.335
Aren't you going
to give me one?

49:53.600 --> 49:56.270
-You could've stayed,
you know.
-Stayed?

49:56.353 --> 49:59.190
I've been insulted.
And poisoned.

49:59.274 --> 50:03.028
Assaulted by a mad Pict
and chased into a river.

50:03.111 --> 50:06.699
I've ruined a good suit.
I nearly died.

50:06.782 --> 50:08.492
I'm sorry.

50:08.576 --> 50:12.164
I've had the time
of my life, Archie.

50:12.247 --> 50:14.583
The bank will give
you another six months.

50:14.666 --> 50:18.171
We'll extend
the overdraft by another 75K.

50:18.254 --> 50:21.174
-Make the most of it.
-Thank you very much.

50:23.135 --> 50:26.305
Tell Lexie it's Lancelot.

50:26.388 --> 50:28.725
-Hmm?
-My name.

50:35.733 --> 50:37.568
Right.

50:37.651 --> 50:39.946
We need to talk. Now.
