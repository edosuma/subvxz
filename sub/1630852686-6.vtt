00:15.557 --> 00:18.393
- Being in a new relationship is great,

00:18.393 --> 00:20.229
but everyone has a past.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.064
And back when I was young,

00:22.064 --> 00:25.567
technology had a way of bringing
that past into the present.

00:25.567 --> 00:29.196
- So, after I took the kid's phone,
I turn around and said,

00:29.780 --> 00:32.031
"Not on my school bus."

00:37.079 --> 00:39.706
- That is so funny!

00:39.706 --> 00:41.625
- Big laugh for a boring story,

00:41.625 --> 00:43.168
followed with a little arm squeeze.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.629
You guys are, like,
really into each other, huh?

00:46.630 --> 00:49.675
- Hello. Hello. Hello.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.592
Drushi!

00:51.009 --> 00:52.886
- Oh, that's what
we called Drew in college

00:52.886 --> 00:54.596
because his dorm room
always smelled like fish.

00:55.597 --> 00:56.932
- I didn't know you were coming to town.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.559
- Yeah, I convinced my attending

00:58.559 --> 01:00.060
to clear my surgeries for the weekend,

01:00.060 --> 01:02.020
so we could check out some wedding venues.
- Mm-hmm!

01:02.521 --> 01:04.606
Guys, I think we found the perfect venue.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.108
Creation at Wicker Farm.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.402
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.987
It's this gorgeous hotel
restaurant upstate.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.655
We're gonna spend the weekend there,
do a tasting,

01:11.655 --> 01:14.408
and they told us we can invite
two extra people. So--

01:14.408 --> 01:17.911
- Yes! In! I am creating
a road trip playlist as we speak.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.080
Text me the route
because I want Life Is a Highway

01:20.080 --> 01:22.374
to kick in the moment we pull onto...

01:22.374 --> 01:24.626
an actual highway? Huh?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.045
- We were gonna ask Sophie and Drew.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.757
- Sophie and Drew just started dating.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.051
I'm not sure they're ready
for a weekend getaway.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.136
- They've been dating for a month.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.555
- No, I know, I know.
It's just that, you know, uh,

01:36.555 --> 01:37.973
a weekend getaway's a big step,

01:37.973 --> 01:40.851
and I'm sure these two don't want that
just sprung on them like that.

01:40.851 --> 01:41.685
- We're in!

01:41.685 --> 01:43.145
- Oh great!
- Good. Fantastic.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.646
- Oh... good...

01:44.646 --> 01:45.689
SID:
Jesse,

01:45.689 --> 01:48.275
this is like a couple's thing,
you know? You're a lone wolf.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.694
- Cool euphemism
for pathetically single.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.696
But, actually, you're way off, okay?

01:52.696 --> 01:55.616
I just started seeing this
totally awesome girl named Mia.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.911
And I like her so much, I've even come up
with one of those cute little...

01:58.911 --> 02:01.496
punny... couple names for us.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.249
Mia and Jesse. We're Messy.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.211
- Hello, customers!

02:07.711 --> 02:10.714
I hope you all like beer...

02:11.465 --> 02:13.467
because I forgot
what you actually ordered.

02:13.842 --> 02:17.346
- Hey, Charlie, here's a copy of
your start papers and your passport.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.847
No idea why I photocopied it

02:18.847 --> 02:21.183
because you working here is,
like, completely illegal.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.229
- Man! You've been everywhere.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.688
You were in Brazil six months ago?

02:26.688 --> 02:28.690
- Yes. On a family trip.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.485
- I dated a Brazilian once.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.362
I didn't speak Portuguese,
he didn't speak English,

02:33.362 --> 02:35.239
so we had to speak with our bodies,

02:35.239 --> 02:37.950
and those conversations went deep.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.536
- Hoo-yeah!
- Another charming tale.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.870
I do love it when you casually work

02:41.870 --> 02:44.790
your previous sexual exploits
into conversation. It's such fun!

02:44.790 --> 02:46.041
- Oh, Charlie!

02:46.750 --> 02:48.627
First paycheck.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.254
New job. New apartment.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.173
I'm going to throw a lavish
housewarming dinner party this weekend

02:53.173 --> 02:54.967
to celebrate my many accomplishments.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.260
Ellen.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.513
You can invite that lucky lady who swiped
your post-divorce V-card last week.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.848
- What?

03:00.848 --> 03:03.183
- No, no, no. I-I'm not inviting her.

03:03.642 --> 03:04.893
Alright, fine. Just us then.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.020
- Sorry to miss it. Sid and I

03:07.020 --> 03:09.481
are actually taking a weekend trip
with Drew and Stacey.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.733
Sophie.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.235
Sorry.
- Oh.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.862
It's okay.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.238
Who is Stacey?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.617
- My ex was named Stacey.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.953
Uh, we hung out with Sid and Hannah a lot

03:22.953 --> 03:25.664
when we were together, hence the mix-up.
- Oh.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.749
- Sorry. Won't happen again.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.376
- Already forgotten about it.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.627
I can't stop thinking about it!

03:31.628 --> 03:33.547
Like, I need to know
who this Stacey girl is,

03:33.547 --> 03:35.090
but I have no idea how to find her!

03:35.090 --> 03:36.675
- And I found her.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.552
- What? How?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.803
- Simple. Sid is friends with Hannah,

03:39.803 --> 03:41.597
so I found her account,
went to her tagged photos,

03:41.597 --> 03:44.266
scrolled back until I found a pic of
Hannah with a Staceycakes92

03:44.266 --> 03:46.977
where both S's are dollar signs.
But Staceycakes is obvi gay,

03:46.977 --> 03:49.104
so I started looking for girls who comment
on Hannah's posts a lot,

03:49.104 --> 03:50.397
and found a Stacey Fletcher,

03:50.397 --> 03:52.649
who always says Hannah's outfits are fire.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.693
So, I clicked on her IG,
scrolled back a couple of years,

03:54.693 --> 03:56.320
and boomshakalakaboom.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.238
Sophie meet Stacey,

03:58.238 --> 04:00.949
or Stacey circa two years ago
when she was dating Drew.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.203
- How many boardwalks
did they eat ice cream on?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.497
This is not what I needed
to see right before Drew and I

04:07.497 --> 04:08.790
have sex for the first time.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.209
- You haven't had sex yet?

04:11.043 --> 04:14.922
So, that's why you nerds were so giggly
about your romantic weekend.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.216
- Yeah. And I like that we waited.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.802
Plus, doing it for the first time
in a bougie-ass hotel

04:20.802 --> 04:22.513
is romantic as balls.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.517
Now, I'm just gonna be comparing
myself to Stacey the whole time

04:26.517 --> 04:29.520
and thinking about how she can
roller skate backwards in a sun dress.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.106
- Soph, everyone has exes.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.901
Do not get in your head about this.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.444
Repeat after me.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.613
I... am...

04:39.613 --> 04:40.614
sex.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.618
- I... am... sex.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.371
- Louder.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.958
I! Am! Sex!

04:51.667 --> 04:54.753
- I! Am! Sex!

04:55.212 --> 04:58.632
NEIGHBOR:
We get it! You're sex! Shut the hell up!

05:04.888 --> 05:07.391
- VoilÃ ! A dining table.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.606
- Ellen, are we eating on Amazon boxes
covered in your unicorn bed sheets?

05:14.606 --> 05:17.693
- Pottery Barn Kids is way cheaper
than Pottery Barn regular.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.155
Is that all the food?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.407
- Unfortunately, yes.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.702
I may have overestimated
how far a bartender's paycheck would go.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.037
- Why didn't you just buy cheaper stuff?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.455
- Cheaper stuff?
What do you want me to do,

05:30.455 --> 05:33.000
serve chunks of pepper jack
and pigs in a blanket?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.669
This is the first dinner
we're hosting, Ellen.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.672
Tonight will set the tenor
for our entire social lives.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.134
- Dude, we're eating dinner
with my brother and your girlfriend

05:42.134 --> 05:43.969
on a table made of boxes.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.138
- Oh my god, they're here already!

05:46.138 --> 05:49.683
Alright, Ellen.
Remember, we are the hosts.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.643
If we're having fun,
they're having fun.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.020
Ready?

05:53.020 --> 05:56.481
Hello!

05:56.481 --> 05:59.026
Ellen was just telling me
the most winning of anecdotes.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.319
Come in! Come in!

06:00.319 --> 06:02.529
- Uh, guys, this is Mia.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.532
Mia, this is Charlie,
and this is my sister Ellen.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.911
Mia. Hi.

06:09.661 --> 06:13.081
It is so nice to meet you.
For the first time.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.460
- Oh, is that real leopard?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.213
- No, this is a shirt

06:19.213 --> 06:21.215
with a design on it.

06:21.215 --> 06:25.010
- Still, how would you feel
if I had your skin printed on a shirt?

06:25.636 --> 06:26.970
- Mia is an activist.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.764
She's really passionate about her causes,

06:28.764 --> 06:30.849
which I find to be really inspiring.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.019
- Mia! I would like to give you the tour.
Uh...

06:35.145 --> 06:38.690
This is the living-dining-kitchen-
guest-bed-breakfast-nook-foyer-room,

06:38.690 --> 06:40.984
and over here is...

06:41.818 --> 06:43.487
:
Hello, Mia.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.615
- Hello, woman who never responded
to my many voice texts

06:46.615 --> 06:48.283
after using me for sex.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.660
- Shh...
- Oh, it is you!

06:49.660 --> 06:51.203
I was drinking an iced coffee,

06:51.203 --> 06:53.997
and you shouted at me for using a straw
even though it actually was made of paper.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.874
- Shh! Look,

06:55.874 --> 06:59.127
I think it would be best
if Jesse doesn't find out...

06:59.878 --> 07:01.630
we...
- Oh, I'm not comfortable lying.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.590
I leave that to the politicians.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.885
- Please. He's coming off
a really bad breakup.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.763
If he finds out that the first girl
he's been into since his ex

07:09.763 --> 07:11.515
slept with his sister...

07:11.515 --> 07:12.850
:
it'll scar him for life.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.227
- Plus, this is our first
social event together,

07:15.227 --> 07:18.480
and a brother and sister
having shared a lover is a bit unseemly.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.650
- Fine. I'll keep your secret,

07:21.650 --> 07:24.319
but only because I would
never want to hurt Jesse.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.612
You are lucky I'm an empath.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.740
- Disaster averted. Now,

07:28.740 --> 07:30.909
shall we give everyone their one oyster?

07:33.996 --> 07:36.790
- Welcome to Creation at Wicker Farm.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.292
I'm Grant Rose.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.169
The owner.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.297
- Uh, yeah, no, I could tell.
Um, I own a bar in Manhattan.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.424
We both have BOE--
Big owner energy.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.176
- Creation

07:47.176 --> 07:49.970
is the world's first
hyper-local restaurant.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.806
All of our food is sourced from the farm,

07:52.806 --> 07:54.683
but everything else you see here

07:54.683 --> 07:58.270
was also made from materials
found on the property.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.315
- Wow! So, the-the entire building?

08:01.315 --> 08:03.942
- Built from cedar trees
from the forest behind us.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.236
- What about the host?

08:06.236 --> 08:07.905
You didn't make him?

08:07.905 --> 08:09.990
- Actually, I did. He's my son!

08:09.990 --> 08:11.867
Oh!

08:11.867 --> 08:14.328
Conceived in the room
you're actually staying in.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.705
- Kinda gross.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.005
- This place is super romantic.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.465
Hope our room has the same vibe.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.718
- I know it will
'cause we're staying in it.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.973
I am sex...

08:38.644 --> 08:40.312
Wait a sec.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.025
He took Stacey here.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.863
What nerd created this devil app?

08:56.078 --> 08:59.164
- I am very excited for this risotto.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.959
- Why? You had it before?

09:03.293 --> 09:05.462
- No, just hungry.
- Oh.

09:06.964 --> 09:10.592
I only ask because
I-I saw you walk to the... bathroom,

09:10.592 --> 09:12.636
and it seemed like you
really knew your way around.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.888
- Hm. Well, I've never been here,

09:14.888 --> 09:17.975
but I'm glad to know you like
to watch me walk away.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.144
- I like cute butts, and I cannot lie.

09:24.022 --> 09:27.860
- Sid, I am definitely
picking up on your BOE.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.362
- Oh my god, BOE is happening...

09:31.572 --> 09:34.032
- What made you decide
to open your own place?

09:34.032 --> 09:36.785
- Well, I grew up in India,
and like all good Indians,

09:36.785 --> 09:38.537
my dad and I spent
our afternoons watching

09:38.537 --> 09:39.830
movies about New York City.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.097
SID:
So, my family moved to New York,

09:57.097 --> 09:58.640
I studied hard, got into med school.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.143
That's where Hannah and I met.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.519
She was born to be a doctor.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.521
Me?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.106
Not so much.

10:07.149 --> 10:10.694
But, I did love the bar
where I spent hours and hours studying,

10:10.694 --> 10:12.654
and I loved the man who owned it.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.615
Archie.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.158
And then one day...

10:17.618 --> 10:19.203
Archie passed away,

10:19.203 --> 10:22.206
and suddenly, what I had to do
was crystal clear.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.917
So, I took out a loan and bought the bar.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.377
It was a big swing,
but felt like the right decision

10:27.377 --> 10:28.587
And, uh,

10:28.587 --> 10:30.506
Hannah supported me the entire time.

10:30.506 --> 10:32.007
- Hm. Of course I did.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.259
GRANT:
Wow, what an incredible story.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.636
And equally incredible,

10:35.636 --> 10:37.513
our lobster risotto...

10:37.513 --> 10:39.973
with an edible fork...

10:39.973 --> 10:41.683
made of focaccia.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.353
- Wait a second.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.905
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm!

10:54.905 --> 10:55.864
BRB.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.370
- I remember those sheets...
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.749
- Everyone, please pluck one leaf

11:05.749 --> 11:07.876
and pass it to the left.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.255
So, a pluck...

11:11.255 --> 11:13.006
and pass. Give it a go.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.343
I tell you, I do feel sorry
for Sophie and Sid.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.303
They are missing
the party of the century.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.389
I said one leaf, Mia.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.016
- I hope Sophie's doing okay.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.103
She was really in her head
about Drew's ex before she left.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.355
I wish she was more... Zen.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.607
Like Charlie. He doesn't care
at all when I talk about my exes.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.110
- No, not at all.

11:33.110 --> 11:36.113
Now, is anyone following
the Polo Premier League?

11:36.113 --> 11:38.365
- My relationship history is an open book.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.200
Books, actually.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.744
And it's a long one.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.621
- Actually, Valentina, I hate it, alright?

11:44.621 --> 11:45.706
VALENTINA:
Really? Why?

11:45.706 --> 11:48.166
I wouldn't care if you talked
about your exes at all.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.835
- Alright, fine.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.546
Remember when you were
looking through my passport,

11:52.546 --> 11:54.548
and I said I went to Brazil
on a family trip?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.759
Well, I lied. I went there for a girl.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.511
ELLEN/JESSE:
Ooh...

11:59.511 --> 12:02.514
- So, you had a fling
with a woman in Brazil.

12:03.182 --> 12:04.892
Good for you.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.436
- Actually, it was a bit more than that.

12:08.854 --> 12:11.064
I moved to Brazil... to be with her.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.066
ELLEN/MIA/JESSE:
Ooh...

12:13.984 --> 12:15.235
- Oh.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.698
So, I'm not the only woman
you've moved to another country for.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.201
Cool.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.286
Fun.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.002
- :
More wine, anyone?

12:35.714 --> 12:38.509
- Let's prove you're lying,
you lying liar.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.057
Ha! I knew it.

12:45.057 --> 12:48.519
Of course, Stacey's handwriting's
in cursive.

12:48.519 --> 12:50.437
We get it. You're smart.

12:57.945 --> 13:01.198
- And that is the entire
Wikipedia entry on colonialism.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.116
- Wow.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.618
- Wow.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.038
- Hey, just a few of super-chill
follow-up questions

13:08.038 --> 13:10.707
to that fun story you told
about the Brazilian girl...

13:10.707 --> 13:13.836
- Valentina, I was just proving a point
that nobody likes to hear about exes.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.004
Okay? No need to dwell on it.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.131
- I don't care that you have exes.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.426
I care that, apparently,
you moved across the world

13:21.426 --> 13:23.387
for another girl.
- Girls, okay?

13:23.387 --> 13:24.763
It's happened more than once.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.765
- What?!

13:27.349 --> 13:29.059
- Jesse?

13:29.059 --> 13:31.603
I don't want our relationship
to start on a lie like theirs did.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.438
I slept with your sister.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.982
- What?!
- Damn it!

13:36.358 --> 13:38.151
- That dinner was amazing.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.487
I mean, I think we found our venue, huh?

13:41.905 --> 13:44.658
- Did you just rent a movie
without asking me which one?

13:44.658 --> 13:48.370
- What? I got the Eternals because your
celebrity crush is buff Kumail Nanjiani.

13:49.955 --> 13:50.956
Hold up.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.750
You definitely have a type.

13:54.668 --> 13:58.714
- I cannot believe you just made another
decision without consulting me!

13:59.381 --> 14:01.175
- Okay, this is not
about the movie, is it?

14:01.550 --> 14:03.051
- No, Sid.

14:04.178 --> 14:06.263
This is about you quitting medical school,

14:06.263 --> 14:08.557
so you could upend our lives
and buy a bar.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.603
I thought I was past it,
but hearing you tell that story tonight,

14:12.603 --> 14:14.605
it just brought up
all these old feelings in me.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.775
I never would have made a decision
like that without talking to you.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.862
- Hannah,
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, but,

14:21.862 --> 14:24.239
like, what's done is done.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.241
- "What's done is done"?

14:26.950 --> 14:28.535
That's what you have to say?

14:30.329 --> 14:31.830
- What's done is done...

14:33.373 --> 14:34.791
please?

14:39.338 --> 14:42.299
- I am gonna freshen up real quick,
so our night...

14:42.299 --> 14:44.301
can begin.

14:46.803 --> 14:50.182
That was so lame. Can I take that back?
- Uh-huh.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.060
- Great. See you soon.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.355
:
You're an idiot! Be sexier.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.780
- Well, Drew definitely
brought Stacey here,

15:04.780 --> 15:06.156
and he's lying to me about it.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.449
- Are you drunk?

15:08.158 --> 15:11.161
- The only thing
I'm drunk on is hard truth.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.663
I'm sending you proof.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.457
Did you get it?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.125
- Not yet.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.044
- Oh, no.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.924
I meant to DM you, but instead,
I DMed Stacey.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.093
Oh god, oh god, oh god, she's definitely
gonna reach out to Drew

15:26.093 --> 15:27.135
and tell him I'm crazy!

15:27.135 --> 15:29.429
- Almost as crazy as someone who follows

15:29.429 --> 15:33.141
women around the world,
like a horny Carmen San Diego!

15:35.269 --> 15:36.812
So, what are you going to do about Drew?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.941
- Something stupid.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.617
- Hey, there...

15:56.164 --> 15:57.833
- Sophie? What are you doing out here?

15:57.833 --> 15:59.626
- I screwed up.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.836
What are you doing out here?

16:00.836 --> 16:02.379
- I screwed up, too.

16:04.882 --> 16:05.883
Oh!

16:07.384 --> 16:08.927
- Ooh, seems like you screwed up more.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.971
- :
Oh, you screwed up more! Ha, ha!

16:15.058 --> 16:16.643
- Sorry, I'm just trying to...

16:16.643 --> 16:18.228
wrap my head around this. Uh...

16:18.228 --> 16:21.106
when exactly did the two
of you sleep together?

16:21.690 --> 16:24.193
- Monday night. When did you guys meet?

16:25.777 --> 16:27.321
- Tuesday morning.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.825
I met her at a coffee shop
on my way to your place.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.078
Hi.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.289
- Hi.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.541
- Okay, that timeline is, uh...

16:40.417 --> 16:41.710
chill.

16:42.628 --> 16:45.547
You know what, I'm not gonna
let a... quirky coincidence

16:45.547 --> 16:47.591
stand in the way of
me and my relationship.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.593
- Wow, you must be amazing in bed.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.512
- She's just okay.
- I haven't actually slept with her yet.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.554
Oh my god!

16:53.805 --> 16:55.265
VALENTINA:
So...

16:55.265 --> 16:58.185
let's do a deep dive here
on the old passport.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.896
I say a country,
you say why you went there.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.439
Portugal.
- Girl.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.107
- Spain.
- Tapas.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.360
It was a girl.

17:07.528 --> 17:08.987
- Hey, what's your Wi-Fi?

17:08.987 --> 17:11.698
I need to tweet a bomb threat
to Panera Bread

17:11.698 --> 17:14.368
for their appropriation of poppy seeds.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.870
- How do you appropriate a seed?

17:17.246 --> 17:19.331
- Oh, if you don't know,
you're part of the problem.

17:19.331 --> 17:22.334
- I can't do this anymore.
Mia, you are the worst.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.921
- Finally! How did you not see it earlier?

17:25.921 --> 17:28.048
- I saw it!
I'm just trying to power through

17:28.048 --> 17:29.758
'cause I'm so sick of being single!

17:30.884 --> 17:32.719
It should be me at that dinner tonight.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.057
- Because you miss hanging out
with Sid and Hannah,

17:37.057 --> 17:39.518
or because you wanna be with Sophie?

17:39.935 --> 17:41.395
- What?

17:41.395 --> 17:43.480
The first one, obviously.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.276
- I don't know who any
of those people are. I'm outtie.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.946
- I'm gonna go, too, Charlie.
- Look, please don't leave like this.

17:50.946 --> 17:54.241
Look, I-I swear you're not
just part of some pattern.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.619
Alright, this time, it really is diff--
- I don't believe you.

18:05.794 --> 18:06.795
- What am I gonna do?

18:06.795 --> 18:09.840
I need to get into Drew's phone
to delete Stacey's texts

18:09.840 --> 18:12.259
before he sees them
and realizes I did something crazy!

18:12.259 --> 18:13.343
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.095
what just happened?
- Hm.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.181
- Why did the texts disappear?

18:17.181 --> 18:19.683
- Yeah, Drew probably read them
on his laptop.

18:22.936 --> 18:23.937
- This is so unfair!

18:23.937 --> 18:25.689
He's the one who lied about being here,

18:25.689 --> 18:28.775
and now, I look like the psycho.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.319
- Okay, Sophie...

18:30.903 --> 18:33.113
I don't know exactly what's going on
with you and Drew,

18:33.113 --> 18:35.365
but you don't need to worry about Stacey.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.243
Stacey's just an ex.
Everyone has an ex.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.661
- Not me.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.541
I mean, I've dated a ton of guys,

18:45.292 --> 18:46.752
but I've never...

18:46.752 --> 18:49.254
actually been in a serious relationship.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.424
It always fizzles out
before it gets to that point.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.719
- Well, at least you don't
steamroll your partner

18:55.719 --> 18:58.555
by making major life decisions
without consulting her.

19:00.641 --> 19:03.977
- Is that why you're out here, buying an
apology Kit Kat from the vending machine?

19:04.895 --> 19:05.896
- Guilty.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.774
Yeah, apparently Hannah hasn't forgiven me

19:08.774 --> 19:12.069
for derailing our life plan by
buying a bar without asking her.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.992
- Why didn't you? Ask her?

19:20.285 --> 19:21.537
- I don't know.

19:22.246 --> 19:25.374
I spent the first 27 years of my life
trying to make my parents happy.

19:25.374 --> 19:27.334
Then I met Hannah,
I wanted to make her happy, too.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.127
And with the bar, I just finally
wanted to do something

19:29.127 --> 19:30.712
that would make me happy.

19:31.672 --> 19:34.216
And I knew if I didn't just, like,
propel my body to that bank

19:34.216 --> 19:36.677
and apply for that loan,
I'd end up chickening out.

19:36.677 --> 19:38.053
You know?

19:41.723 --> 19:44.601
- Do you think if you had
asked Hannah first,

19:44.601 --> 19:46.478
that she wouldn't have supported you?

19:46.478 --> 19:47.980
- Ah, she would have.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.401
Definitely would have.
Messed up.

19:54.027 --> 19:58.115
Hey, I know it's super scary to go
all-in on a relationship.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.826
And, from what I know
about your childhood,

20:00.826 --> 20:04.079
you probably feel like the rug could be
ripped out from under you at any second.

20:05.539 --> 20:06.540
- Yeah.

20:07.624 --> 20:08.876
I do.

20:10.294 --> 20:12.838
- But, if it's the right person...

20:16.008 --> 20:17.509
things can work out.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.180
I promise.

20:23.891 --> 20:26.310
- Let's go talk to our people.
- Mm-hmm.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.397
Hey! Hey, now!

20:30.397 --> 20:33.066
You're seriously gonna go back there
without a peace offering Kit Kat?

20:35.903 --> 20:37.905
You really haven't been in a relationship.

20:44.328 --> 20:45.579
- Listen.

20:45.579 --> 20:48.040
I have known for a very long time

20:48.040 --> 20:50.918
that I've had to escape
from my petty, stifling family.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.754
And, yes, I have often
followed women across the world

20:53.754 --> 20:55.005
as a way of doing that.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.258
But it's never felt right.

20:59.051 --> 21:00.052
Until now.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.222
And I've figured out how
I'm gonna prove it to you.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.974
- What are you doing?!

21:05.974 --> 21:09.228
- I'm proving to you that you
are not just part of some pattern.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.897
I'm not going anywhere, Valentina.

21:11.897 --> 21:14.066
Oh my god, this is really hot!

21:17.444 --> 21:19.279
- What the hell is your
passport made out of?!

21:19.279 --> 21:21.657
- I soaked it in lighter fluid
on the way over.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.283
I was going for high drama!

21:29.039 --> 21:30.290
- That was... sweet.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.127
Look, just so you know,

21:34.127 --> 21:37.005
I wouldn't usually spiral
in such a lame basic way

21:37.005 --> 21:39.424
about you having exes. There were...

21:39.424 --> 21:41.635
extenuating circumstances.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.763
- What were they?

21:48.934 --> 21:50.435
- I...

21:52.771 --> 21:54.773
...love you.

21:58.777 --> 21:59.820
- I love you, too.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.377
- From now on,

22:15.377 --> 22:17.754
I want you to be a part of
every big life decision I make

22:17.754 --> 22:20.215
until we die together at 98.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.717
Mid-penetrayshe.

22:23.260 --> 22:24.261
- Thank you.

22:25.679 --> 22:28.307
But you know,
I don't wanna die mid-penetrayshe.

22:29.391 --> 22:32.728
I want us to die drinking
Cadillac margaritas

22:32.728 --> 22:36.648
on safari because our IRAs
are so well-funded.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.278
- Well,

22:41.278 --> 22:43.280
both of those things can be true.

22:44.323 --> 22:47.034
Man, we are gonna ruin
so many people's safari.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.462
BOTH:
I'm sorry.

23:00.589 --> 23:02.090
- Me first.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.345
I'm sorry I stole your phone

23:07.888 --> 23:09.973
and called your ex a bitch.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.143
- And I'm sorry for lying
to you about having been here.

23:14.228 --> 23:16.438
I just didn't want to explain
how I got into, like,

23:16.438 --> 23:19.775
a huge blowout fight
with Stacey at the same place

23:19.775 --> 23:21.735
we're having a romantic weekend.

23:22.486 --> 23:24.488
- According to the Gram,

23:24.488 --> 23:26.323
and the guest book,

23:26.323 --> 23:28.575
you guys had the best night of your lives.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.787
You even did that thing where you touch
index fingers with your thumb,

23:31.787 --> 23:33.497
so you can make a heart.

23:34.081 --> 23:37.376
That's hard to do.
My god, do I have early-onset arthritis?

23:39.586 --> 23:41.088
- Can I show you something?

23:45.801 --> 23:47.594
Zoom in on her sunglasses.

23:55.644 --> 23:58.480
Yeah, we got into a huge fight at dinner

23:58.480 --> 24:00.440
about how 90% of our relationship

24:00.440 --> 24:02.484
was spent posing for photos.

24:02.985 --> 24:04.528
It was the worst trip ever,

24:04.528 --> 24:06.864
and I went to Fyre Festival.

24:06.864 --> 24:08.282
Stupid Ja Rule.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.914
- Well, I know how we can turn this place

24:15.914 --> 24:18.333
from a bad memory into a good one.

24:25.883 --> 24:28.468
FUTURE SOPHIE:
And right there, in that hotel room, he--

24:28.468 --> 24:29.845
SOPHIE'S SON : Mom!
- What?

24:29.845 --> 24:33.265
SOPHIE'S SON: Can you please not
graphically describe your sex life to me?

24:33.265 --> 24:34.474
- Prude!
