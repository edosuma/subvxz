WEBVTT

00:22.291 --> 00:26.083
I know one, or many of you

00:27.416 --> 00:30.125
are privy to what really caused the fire.

00:31.375 --> 00:36.333
Henceforth, there will be
heightened security on school grounds.

00:36.416 --> 00:40.666
We will be conducting
random stop and search exercises.

00:40.750 --> 00:44.333
Hopefully this will caution any student

00:45.000 --> 00:47.500
who wants to be a nuisance to this school.

01:09.875 --> 01:13.125
The reason
I called for today's joint art class is

01:13.916 --> 01:17.125
to announce the students
who made the shortlist

01:17.208 --> 01:21.041
for the London Art Institute grant.

01:21.666 --> 01:24.000
-Drum rolls, please!

01:24.666 --> 01:26.708
For the year two class, we have

01:27.291 --> 01:28.666
Liz Ajanaku.

01:30.416 --> 01:31.583
Atlas Omosede.

01:33.208 --> 01:36.125
And last but certainly not the least,

01:36.208 --> 01:38.291
for the year one class, we have

01:38.875 --> 01:40.250
Ishaya Bello.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.166
Dauda!

02:12.250 --> 02:15.291
-Come, let's go. Come.
-Ah-ah! Big boy!

03:14.041 --> 03:16.166
This is insane! They can't do this!

03:16.250 --> 03:19.375
-What's going on?
-Wait till my mum hears about this.

03:20.291 --> 03:21.583
This is wrong!

03:22.166 --> 03:23.750
-What's up?
-They're searching our bags.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.583
Can you imagine? Guys!

03:25.666 --> 03:28.916
Are we really going to allow this?
They're infringing on our human rights!

03:29.000 --> 03:32.041
-Tell that to the principal.
-I'm not going to take this.

03:32.666 --> 03:33.708
No to search!

03:33.791 --> 03:37.250
No to search! No to search!

03:48.208 --> 03:49.541
No to search!

03:49.625 --> 03:52.166
No to search! No freedom, no peace!

03:52.250 --> 03:54.250
No to search!

03:54.333 --> 03:57.125
No to search!
No freedom, no peace!

03:57.208 --> 03:59.833
No to search! No to search!

03:59.916 --> 04:02.833
No to search! No freedom, no peace!

04:02.916 --> 04:05.625
No to search! No to search!

04:05.708 --> 04:07.458
No freedom, no peace!

04:07.541 --> 04:09.791
No to search! No to search!

04:09.875 --> 04:16.041
No freedom, no peace!
No to search!

04:17.083 --> 04:19.208
We tried to stop them, sir.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.208
I promise
I'll stop the protest, sir.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.708
-If you just give me the week--
-The week?

04:23.791 --> 04:26.083
First it was you
and your incompetent assistant

04:26.166 --> 04:30.333
that gave test answers
to that fool, Babatunde,

04:30.416 --> 04:34.458
And the idiot loses it
to a backwater slum rat.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.458
And now you cannot control some children?

04:37.541 --> 04:42.041
-Sir--
-You have 24 hours to stop this!

04:42.125 --> 04:45.500
Otherwise, you will not have a job here
or anywhere in this country!

04:46.916 --> 04:49.416
When this is over,
you summon a PTA meeting.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.500
Or…

04:50.583 --> 04:53.416
Is that
too much for your capabilities too?

04:54.958 --> 04:57.708
No to search!
No freedom, no peace.

04:57.791 --> 05:02.416
No to search! No freedom, no peace.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.416
-No to search!

05:18.333 --> 05:19.916
My mum is just…

05:20.000 --> 05:21.083
Argh!

05:22.458 --> 05:24.166
Hey, relax.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.125
Now I'm here to ease your stress.

05:26.208 --> 05:28.250
No to search!

05:28.333 --> 05:29.666
So…

05:30.708 --> 05:34.375
Are we going to the ball
together again this year?

05:34.958 --> 05:38.000
Nen, you know we only went together
because Carmen had the accident.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.166
Nen, we came to chill.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.125
Don't fuck up the mood!

05:50.000 --> 05:53.625
And as for your offer to ease my stress…

05:55.291 --> 05:57.833
You're only with me
'cause Carmen won't sleep with you.

06:08.666 --> 06:09.875
If you love me,

06:10.541 --> 06:11.875
I want you to wear it.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.125
Let me show you. Here.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.125
-See?

06:56.916 --> 06:59.791
It's… It's better when you do it.

07:10.708 --> 07:11.875
"No to search."

07:13.833 --> 07:14.708
No to search.

07:14.791 --> 07:21.666
No to search!
No freedom, no peace!

07:31.916 --> 07:34.625
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?
Your parents own the school.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.708
So stay quiet in the face of injustice?

07:36.791 --> 07:38.708
-Leave me--

07:38.791 --> 07:40.375
I'm sorry. I can replace it.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.916
-It's fine, just some cheap nonsense.
-Cool.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.250
No to search!
No freedom, no peace.

08:00.541 --> 08:01.541
Ah!

08:02.208 --> 08:04.833
Extravagant.

08:05.916 --> 08:08.291
-No to search! Eh?

08:16.375 --> 08:19.125
No to search!
No freedom, no peace!

08:41.583 --> 08:46.000
At least Iverem
finally did her job, stopping the riots.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.583
And how did she manage that?

08:47.666 --> 08:51.916
Suspension of classes,
pending a PTA meeting.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.541
The people who started this riot,
that led it,

08:54.625 --> 08:56.458
the bad apples, must be dealt with.

08:56.541 --> 09:00.416
The public relations team thinks
that we should drown the entire noise

09:00.500 --> 09:02.625
with the Founder's Day ball.

09:04.041 --> 09:05.041
Art.

09:06.125 --> 09:08.166
They auction art from the students

09:08.250 --> 09:12.208
and give the proceeds
to the less privileged.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.083
And we do have one amongst ourselves.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.458
Exactly, and he's an artist.

09:16.541 --> 09:19.750
Imagine if one of his pieces sells
for a huge sum of money.

09:19.833 --> 09:22.375
And we now put that money
back into his community!

09:22.458 --> 09:24.041
The people love a good fairy tale.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.416
And of course we have
our darling Carmen and Atlas.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.208
They'll be the king and queen
of the night.

09:29.291 --> 09:31.083
Mum, you know
students have to vote, right?

09:34.083 --> 09:34.916
Essien.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.291
You can talk to Essien.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.708
Have him donate
a piece of art to the school

09:38.791 --> 09:40.583
and come and mount it himself.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.208
The publicity.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.541
Now, you, my wife, are a genius.

09:46.625 --> 09:47.666
Yes, I am.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.791
Oh, it will be amazing!

09:52.958 --> 09:54.750
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:54.833 --> 09:58.333
I think the school is acting
in the best interest of our children--

09:58.416 --> 10:00.958
It is ridiculous to treat
our children like criminals!

10:02.208 --> 10:04.375
Sir, I'm sorry. My class just finished.

10:04.458 --> 10:07.666
Why did I have to call you to find out
about your school catching fire?

10:08.250 --> 10:10.333
Sir, I was going to tell you, but--

10:10.416 --> 10:12.333
I hope nothing happened to my goods.

10:16.333 --> 10:17.958
Sir. Sir…

10:19.791 --> 10:22.125
Sir, please,
can we not talk about this here?

10:22.208 --> 10:24.333
-Please.
-Are you giving me orders?

10:24.416 --> 10:26.500
Sir, I could never do that, God forbid!
God forbid!

10:26.583 --> 10:28.750
-Ishaya?
-Hey.

10:30.333 --> 10:34.250
Is this your, uh… your guardian?

10:34.750 --> 10:37.083
-Actually, he's my--
-I'm his uncle.

10:37.916 --> 10:40.666
I'm Boyin Iruhe, his art teacher.

10:42.875 --> 10:43.875
My name is Government.

10:44.583 --> 10:48.208
Thank you for coming for our PTA meeting
on such short notice.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.166
If you can please come with me.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.416
Please! Please, parents!

10:58.500 --> 11:00.458
And for what exactly?

11:00.541 --> 11:02.375
Because of a small
lab damage?

11:02.458 --> 11:03.458
Something I can pay for.

11:05.875 --> 11:09.000
Please!
Please, can we speak one at a time?

11:09.083 --> 11:12.041
-Please.
-Look, it's not all about money.

11:12.125 --> 11:16.041
These children need Jesus
incorporated into their daily lives.

11:16.125 --> 11:19.958
If it is that, Mummy GO, then they must
also call Muslims to pray on Fridays.

11:20.041 --> 11:21.291
And Traditionalists.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.500
Yes.

11:26.583 --> 11:29.833
-Ladies and gentlemen, I…

11:31.666 --> 11:34.750
We understand your worries.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.458
The stop and search will stop.

11:45.375 --> 11:48.083
But this is the 21st century.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.208
In order to save our children
even from themselves,

11:53.291 --> 11:55.916
we must evolve with the times,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.333
which is why
the school will be mounting cameras

11:59.416 --> 12:02.791
in all the classrooms and the hallways.

12:08.750 --> 12:11.958
I really don't appreciate being
forced here, so please make it quick.

12:12.791 --> 12:15.250
It's about Atlas's school fees.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.291
Oh.

12:16.375 --> 12:19.833
If his fees aren't paid,
he will have to stop classes.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.333
Mrs… Gemade.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.125
How can you help?

12:27.208 --> 12:29.250
I already told you, if he doesn't--

12:29.333 --> 12:30.750
No, no, no, madam.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.666
Enough with the English.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.541
How can we extend the deadline?

12:37.583 --> 12:40.208
Well,
the Chairman of the Board

12:40.291 --> 12:44.291
is the only one who can give
such an extension, but he doesn't--

12:44.375 --> 12:46.291
Chairman, as in Feyi?

12:46.875 --> 12:48.083
Carmen's father?

12:49.916 --> 12:51.125
You should have said that.

13:09.291 --> 13:10.500
You sold everything?

13:13.333 --> 13:16.500
Maybe Wilmer Academy
is too small a territory for you, huh?

13:17.625 --> 13:19.750
Maybe you should be promoted
so that Joe can learn--

13:19.833 --> 13:22.708
Mr. Government,
thank you very much for the promotion,

13:22.791 --> 13:25.708
but, sir,
I want to focus on being an artist,

13:25.791 --> 13:28.000
and Wilmer Academy can help me do that.

13:28.833 --> 13:29.833
Artist?

13:30.333 --> 13:31.333
Yes, sir.

13:31.416 --> 13:34.625
Sir, I can draw.
I promise you, I'm very talented, sir.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.500
You're talented.

13:36.583 --> 13:40.166
Sir, maybe I should draw something
for you so that you will believe me--

13:40.250 --> 13:41.375
Shut up and get in the car.

13:46.375 --> 13:49.125
There you go.

13:50.416 --> 13:53.958
Government, I won't lie.
This boy did well.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.333
But he doesn't want to be promoted.

13:56.416 --> 13:59.750
He's not the only smart one.
Adufe will also get the promotion.

14:00.958 --> 14:02.666
You will help sell the molly.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.125
You are enjoying her grace.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.666
She asked me
to give you and Ishaya some time.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.500
Ishaya, you will teach her
how to sell molly.

14:11.208 --> 14:12.958
Are you deaf?

14:13.041 --> 14:14.500
Do you want me to punch you?

14:14.583 --> 14:16.583
I said you'll teach her how to sell molly!

14:17.083 --> 14:19.416
-Yes, sir.
-Uh, Oga Rambo?

14:19.500 --> 14:21.750
-What?
-What about me?

14:21.833 --> 14:23.333
You will all sell it.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.583
The person with the highest sales
gets 10% commission.

14:27.333 --> 14:31.208
Government, give the goods
to Ishaya and Adufe to sell.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.625
Understand?

14:36.500 --> 14:39.916
You, sell one million.
Ishaya, you sell one million naira.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.708
But, sir, you saw they're putting
cameras everywhere in my school.

14:42.791 --> 14:44.208
Find your way around them.

14:50.291 --> 14:51.708
My Adufe.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.250
You know Daddy doesn't like losing money.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.708
Don't disappoint me.

14:57.458 --> 14:58.625
Make me proud.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.291
Get up!

15:04.250 --> 15:06.750
Just that punch and you are on the floor.
Are you mad?

15:07.875 --> 15:09.500
Back in position.

15:10.125 --> 15:13.208
Do you want me to punch you to death?

15:31.791 --> 15:35.958
Ishaya, get out of this house
and don't return! Out!

15:36.625 --> 15:37.875
Mummy…

15:44.000 --> 15:46.375
So his mother owns Frankees?

15:46.458 --> 15:47.541
Mmm-hmm!

15:47.625 --> 15:50.375
And he got me this
with, like, 1,000,000 books inside.

15:50.458 --> 15:51.375
-Wow!
-Let me put it on.

15:51.458 --> 15:55.416
Lala, I saw you at the football game,
what's up with you and Frank? Eh?

15:56.708 --> 15:59.000
-I'm talking to you.
-Leave me!

15:59.083 --> 16:01.125
Don't break her new gift!

16:01.208 --> 16:02.416
-Hmm!
-Ishaya.

16:03.875 --> 16:04.875
Mummy.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.541
What are you doing here?

16:10.041 --> 16:13.041
I brought money
for house rent and other things.

16:22.750 --> 16:25.041
We don't take money
from hoodlums!

16:44.083 --> 16:45.333
Who gave that to you?

16:46.875 --> 16:49.750
-None of your business.
-Was it Frank?

16:54.833 --> 16:57.041
If this is how
you want to be living your life,

16:57.125 --> 16:59.416
you should have stayed in Rush
and be dancing for money.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.125
Rubbish.

17:01.625 --> 17:02.458
Ishaya!

17:43.416 --> 17:44.291
Ishaya.

17:45.375 --> 17:46.416
Here you go.

17:50.916 --> 17:54.250
You think you can
buy anybody with your money, right?

17:55.333 --> 17:57.958
You are talking to my sister
behind my back. Are you crazy?

17:59.000 --> 18:02.125
Ishaya, please.
I really like Rahila.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.416
I think you are crazy, Frank.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.375
Leave Rahila alone.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.083
Do you understand?

18:10.166 --> 18:12.625
If not, I swear you'll regret it.

18:26.916 --> 18:30.458
Baido, did you see my molly?
It was in a red purse.

18:30.541 --> 18:31.708
Red purse?

18:32.416 --> 18:36.041
I saw Joe
with a red purse or bag.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.291
Joe, Joe…

18:42.375 --> 18:45.375
Switched off,
switched off, switched off.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.875
Joe has killed me.

18:50.166 --> 18:51.750
I know Joe's house.

18:58.583 --> 19:02.583
And the crowd goes wild
for fine boy Frank in the building!

19:05.291 --> 19:06.875
Why are you sitting over there?

19:10.333 --> 19:11.916
-What's up with Frank?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.583
Are you guys fighting?

19:17.541 --> 19:18.916
Essien is coming to Wilmer.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.833
-Ha-ha! Yes!
-What's that got to do with you and Frank?

19:22.916 --> 19:24.875
-Good morning, class.
-Good morning.

19:24.958 --> 19:25.875
I'll tell you later.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.833
Guy, Essien!

19:30.416 --> 19:31.375
He's my hero.

19:31.458 --> 19:36.375
Essien is the first person to win
the Global Hyperrealism Prize four times.

19:36.458 --> 19:39.583
Guy, I get it. You love him,
you want to be like him when you grow up.

19:39.666 --> 19:41.541
-Yes!
-But, guy, what's up with you and Frank?

19:42.125 --> 19:44.541
Oh, my God!

19:44.625 --> 19:48.250
-Hey, please come to the ball with me.
-Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

19:48.333 --> 19:51.583
-Would you come to the ball with me?

19:51.666 --> 19:54.500
-Nice one. Nice one.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.708
Do you have a date for the ball?

20:08.750 --> 20:11.791
The person I want to go with
is going with someone else.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.166
Hmm.

20:16.250 --> 20:19.125
Well, there's always next year.

20:27.583 --> 20:30.916
So, what's your plan for delivery…

20:32.708 --> 20:33.958
Dr. High?

20:34.875 --> 20:36.583
The cameras have started working.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.000
I haven't actually thought of anything.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.791
But I'll figure it out.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.208
I think I have a plan.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.208
What do you see?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.416
-Books.
-Ugh, really?

20:59.666 --> 21:01.708
Okay, what don't you see?

21:12.041 --> 21:13.583
-Cameras!

21:32.583 --> 21:34.041
Don't worry.

21:34.541 --> 21:36.541
I'll bring you the molly.

21:36.625 --> 21:39.541
I'm just getting home.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.958
Joe… Joe! Joe!

21:58.375 --> 21:59.375
Get out of my way!

21:59.958 --> 22:00.916
You missed!

22:04.916 --> 22:06.625
-Joe! Joe!
-Listen to me.

22:06.708 --> 22:09.583
The fact that you are with Oga Rambo
doesn't make you my boss!

22:09.666 --> 22:10.500
Talk to my ass!

22:10.583 --> 22:11.708
-Joe!
-Get lost!

22:15.875 --> 22:16.708
Joe!

22:24.708 --> 22:28.208
Atlas,
are you taking Carmen to the ball,

22:28.291 --> 22:30.583
or is she going with him?

22:39.166 --> 22:40.416
Hey, Atlas…

22:44.958 --> 22:46.166
How about you?

22:46.250 --> 22:48.083
Are you taking someone,

22:48.166 --> 22:49.833
or do you want to go with me?

22:57.458 --> 22:58.708
Let's go.

23:11.166 --> 23:12.916
You fought with Ishaya, right?

23:13.416 --> 23:15.416
Can you
help my date to get a dress?

23:15.500 --> 23:16.333
I'll pay.

23:16.416 --> 23:18.958
You have a date and I don't?

23:19.500 --> 23:21.625
-Wow!
-What about Reggie?

23:24.125 --> 23:25.791
I don't think he's going to ask me.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.250
So?

23:29.791 --> 23:30.625
Who's your date?

23:31.250 --> 23:32.750
Ishaya's sister, Rahila.

23:34.875 --> 23:35.791
What?

23:37.375 --> 23:38.583
Thank you.

23:45.333 --> 23:46.291
Okay.

23:46.875 --> 23:47.916
What's going on?

23:49.208 --> 23:51.083
Oh! Thanks.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.458
Thank you.

23:55.375 --> 23:56.208
Wow.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.958
Zina,
will you go to the ball with me?

24:03.041 --> 24:04.958
-Mmm-hmm.

24:05.041 --> 24:06.875
I thought you'd never ask.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.458
Rahila, it's just a small loan.
Just 1,000,000 naira.

24:21.541 --> 24:22.791
His family has the money.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.291
I'm going
to buy some medicine.

24:35.625 --> 24:36.875
<i>Are you okay?</i>

24:39.541 --> 24:42.583
I'm just going to the pharmacy
down the road. I'll be right back.

24:51.583 --> 24:53.791
Oh, God. Oh, God.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.833
Thank you.
Tell Mr. Richard thank you for me.

25:28.916 --> 25:31.750
-If he needs another, he should call me.
-All right, take care.

25:37.083 --> 25:39.166
Why don't you just beg him, huh?

25:39.833 --> 25:41.291
Is he not your boyfriend again?

25:41.375 --> 25:44.041
You know this man,
he likes money more than his life.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.166
-He'll kill me.
-What do you want me to do?

25:48.500 --> 25:51.583
I have a plan to get the money, but…

25:55.541 --> 25:56.791
I'm listening.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.458
<i>Rahila's boyfriend, Frank…</i>

26:02.541 --> 26:04.291
<i>You'll call him outside…</i>

26:04.375 --> 26:07.125
<i>We will pick him up.</i>
<i>We will take him to a safe place.</i>

26:08.083 --> 26:09.625
<i>I'll call his mother.</i>

26:10.583 --> 26:12.458
<i>She will pay for his release.</i>

26:13.625 --> 26:16.541
<i>Then we pay Oga Rambo his money, hmm?</i>

26:16.625 --> 26:18.791
We can do it
at your school ball coming up.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.166
Adufe.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.250
After all I did for you,
can't you do this for me?

26:26.333 --> 26:29.041
Are you crazy?
Kidnapping my friend is not a small favor.

26:29.125 --> 26:30.041
Your friend?

26:30.125 --> 26:33.000
-Am I not your friend?
-Adufe, don't tell me that.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.666
After I risked my life for you,
you can't help me?

26:35.750 --> 26:36.583
Shh!

26:36.666 --> 26:39.708
You know what Oga Rambo would've done
if he had caught me helping Rahila.

26:39.791 --> 26:42.000
I'd have been dead.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.250
I know you've helped me.

26:44.333 --> 26:47.666
But kidnapping is not a little thing,
listen to yourself.

26:47.750 --> 26:51.166
You know I won't suffer this alone
if Oga Rambo finds out.

26:51.916 --> 26:53.791
I don't understand. What do you mean?

26:54.291 --> 26:56.916
Why do you think
Joe has the guts to steal from Rush?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.041
Didn't you steal first?

26:59.125 --> 27:01.541
If we don't find Joe,
you'll be the scapegoat.

27:01.625 --> 27:04.791
They'll come for your entire family.

27:51.583 --> 27:52.750
Thank you.

27:53.583 --> 27:55.125
Man of the hour.

29:10.541 --> 29:13.500
Everyone, meet Rahila.

29:13.583 --> 29:15.750
Frank's date and Ishaya's sister.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.666
Great! Now that we have that out the way…

29:22.750 --> 29:25.541
Let's have fun
and resume fighting tomorrow, yes?

29:34.416 --> 29:37.166
I was rather surprised
at the other one's art,

29:37.250 --> 29:38.333
you know, the welfare kid.

29:38.416 --> 29:40.375
Well, he's no Atlas, is he?

29:40.458 --> 29:42.041
Of course not. But he is talented.

29:56.083 --> 29:57.000
Sir.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.833
I drew this one.

30:02.666 --> 30:05.125
I'm Ishaya. Ishaya Bello.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.875
Sir, you are my role model.

30:08.958 --> 30:12.583
You are the person that I want to be like,
you know, when I grow up.

30:12.666 --> 30:14.666
I love all your works.

30:15.166 --> 30:19.166
You know, I was so happy to hear
that Atlas would win the London art grant.

30:19.250 --> 30:22.625
We couldn't possibly allow a classless,

30:22.708 --> 30:27.333
moneyless charity case
represent our school in London.

30:28.250 --> 30:31.083
Let me tell you,
your apprenticeship program,

30:31.166 --> 30:33.958
I applied for it and I qualified.
You picked me.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.666
It's just that I…

30:35.750 --> 30:39.666
I didn't have money to travel,
and, you know, many, many other things.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.083
-But, sir--
-You want me to keep the spot.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.291
Yes. Yes, sir. I want to keep the spot.

30:44.375 --> 30:47.041
You know, sir,
I know that if I learn from you,

30:47.833 --> 30:50.208
I'll be the greatest artist in the world.

30:51.333 --> 30:52.333
You're good.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.916
But not good enough
for me to change my schedule.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.458
There was a deadline.

30:59.041 --> 30:59.875
You missed it.

31:03.041 --> 31:05.791
Piece of advice,
so you don't waste another person's time.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.958
Don't apply
if you can't even afford to travel.

31:24.916 --> 31:29.583
Um, so,
how about his school fees?

31:31.083 --> 31:33.125
It's not such a huge amount.

31:33.208 --> 31:34.625
Surely you can afford that.

31:37.708 --> 31:42.125
How is the young lady that Carmen hit
in that unfortunate accident?

31:43.333 --> 31:44.750
Is she still in a coma?

31:45.416 --> 31:46.791
Is she dead?

31:46.875 --> 31:49.000
-Are you trying to blackmail us?
-I'm just…

31:50.083 --> 31:54.500
thanking you in advance
for canceling out the outstanding balance.

31:55.958 --> 31:57.916
Excuse me, I have to go mingle.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.708
I am, after all, single.

32:24.208 --> 32:27.208
Ishaya, I saw you leave.
What happened with Essien?

32:27.291 --> 32:28.708
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

32:28.791 --> 32:29.958
What's wrong?

32:32.208 --> 32:33.666
What happened?

32:38.541 --> 32:39.750
It's okay.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.250
It's okay.

32:51.375 --> 32:52.375
It's okay.

33:10.833 --> 33:12.333
What the fuck?

33:13.583 --> 33:16.250
-Uh…
-Are you cheating on me with this clown?

33:16.833 --> 33:19.000
I fucking told you
not to show her the video!

33:19.083 --> 33:20.083
What video?

33:21.541 --> 33:22.833
What are you talking about?

33:24.291 --> 33:25.875
What is he talking about?

33:27.916 --> 33:29.041
Car… Car, baby.

33:29.125 --> 33:31.375
I was drunk. The kiss meant nothing.

33:32.416 --> 33:34.291
Nnenna means nothing to me.

33:36.916 --> 33:38.541
You cheated on me…

33:40.125 --> 33:41.416
with Nnenna?

33:43.625 --> 33:44.583
And you knew?

33:46.375 --> 33:47.958
-Carmen, I--
-Car, baby.

33:48.916 --> 33:50.791
I was drunk. The alcohol…

33:50.875 --> 33:52.083
I love you.

33:52.708 --> 33:55.333
After everything…

33:56.375 --> 33:58.416
I was… I was drunk.

34:00.708 --> 34:04.125
Carmen, Carmen, please, let me… Let me…

34:04.833 --> 34:07.958
-Now you want to talk to me?
-Listen, Carmen…

34:10.875 --> 34:11.833
Carmen.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.083
Carmen, I'm sorry.

34:14.166 --> 34:15.375
Fuck!

34:17.208 --> 34:18.541
Bastard!

34:20.041 --> 34:21.041
Fuck.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.208
Fuck!

34:24.250 --> 34:25.791
<i>All the art has been sold.</i>

34:26.375 --> 34:31.208
Now it's time to announce
King and Queen of the Founder's Ball.

34:31.291 --> 34:32.541
And the winners are

34:33.125 --> 34:35.375
-Carmen Wilmer Willoughby…
-Nnenna!

34:35.458 --> 34:37.666
-…and Atlas Omosede!

35:15.500 --> 35:19.208
Please, I'm sorry. Please…
keep it together.

35:20.916 --> 35:21.916
Please.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.916
Carmen, just… just take it easy.

35:30.916 --> 35:32.416
Queen of Founder's Day.

35:37.958 --> 35:40.333
But I don't really
feel like a queen.

35:54.125 --> 35:56.875
Last year, I was in an accident.

35:57.875 --> 36:01.041
-And everybody thought I was driving.
-Carmen, please…

36:01.750 --> 36:02.833
But it was Atlas.

36:05.750 --> 36:07.000
Not me.

36:07.625 --> 36:08.791
But the real pain

36:10.125 --> 36:12.375
is while I was hiding his secret,

36:12.458 --> 36:14.250
my boyfriend, Atlas,

36:14.333 --> 36:17.875
was cheating on me
with my best friend, Nnenna.

36:24.541 --> 36:26.000
And thank you all for voting…

36:29.791 --> 36:31.375
but I can't be your queen.

36:33.125 --> 36:34.000
Carmen--

37:22.583 --> 37:24.458
-Just one minute.
-Okay.

37:30.333 --> 37:33.916
Ishaya, I'm at the parking lot.
I can't see you.

37:49.708 --> 37:51.333
Ishaya, where is Frank?

37:55.208 --> 37:56.666
I had to help Adufe.

37:58.875 --> 38:01.416
Ishaya, what did you do?

38:02.750 --> 38:03.708
Frank!

38:04.833 --> 38:05.833
Frank!

38:08.250 --> 38:10.458
<i>Ishaya, what did you do?</i>
