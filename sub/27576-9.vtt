WEBVTT

00:05.470 --> 00:06.870
Previoulsy on Heartland...

00:06.890 --> 00:08.500
Did you pump Star full of painkillers

00:08.520 --> 00:11.550
- so she could run that race?
- What? No.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.380
We ran bloodwork, Laura.

00:13.530 --> 00:14.670
We know.

00:15.410 --> 00:17.420
What matters is the franchise is sold,

00:17.430 --> 00:18.710
and Georgie can go to Europe.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.850
Is that why you sold
your shares in Maggie's?

00:20.890 --> 00:23.120
It's Georgie's dream,
so it will all be worth it.

00:23.130 --> 00:26.090
Garland Foods would like
to increase our order.

00:26.130 --> 00:28.100
I think we should tell
Fred we can't do it.

00:28.110 --> 00:29.270
Why, what are you talking about?

00:29.300 --> 00:32.159
We'll discuss it more
when Tim gets back.

00:32.390 --> 00:34.270
Come on, let's go, honey.
We can still make it.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.530
No. We can't.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.360
It's over.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.630
- Star is racing today.
- What?

00:41.730 --> 00:43.640
She's gonna be so doped she
won't even feel her leg,

00:43.660 --> 00:44.600
she's gonna break it!

00:44.630 --> 00:47.210
What is Laura thinking?
Ty, we've gotta stop her!

01:02.540 --> 01:05.640
One more win,
that's all I'm asking, okay?

01:05.670 --> 01:07.170
Just like last week.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.310
Will the horses for Race Six

01:09.330 --> 01:12.190
please head to the paddock. Race Six.

01:13.590 --> 01:14.450
Okay.

01:14.770 --> 01:15.890
That's us.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.660
You can do this, Star.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.500
Let's check the stables first.

01:39.660 --> 01:41.240
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.730
- That's her stall.
- Where's Shooting Star?

01:48.760 --> 01:50.600
- The chestnut filly?
- Yeah, from Fairfield.

01:50.620 --> 01:53.170
- Her race got called.
- Oh, dammit!

01:54.750 --> 01:57.040
Laura! Where is she?

01:58.180 --> 01:59.150
Warming up.

01:59.180 --> 02:01.010
You're never gonna get
by the drug testing.

02:01.100 --> 02:02.350
Well, we did last week.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.290
And I am sure we'll be
under the threshold again.

02:04.310 --> 02:05.500
Well,
with the amount of bute that you pumped

02:05.510 --> 02:07.100
into her system, it's not likely.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.759
There's no bute in her system.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.940
Well,
either way she can't run on that leg.

02:11.950 --> 02:14.060
So we're gonna pull her
from the race right now.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.920
Actually, I'm in charge at Fairfield.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.260
Of all the horses,
and that includes Star.

02:20.620 --> 02:22.400
And I decided she's good to go.

02:22.470 --> 02:24.110
Will the horses for Race Six

02:24.110 --> 02:25.830
please move to the starting gate.

02:25.860 --> 02:26.900
Besides...

02:27.860 --> 02:28.870
you're too late.

03:13.130 --> 03:14.790
You're putting Star's life in danger.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.020
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm gonna get her myself.

03:17.050 --> 03:19.170
Hey Ty, what's going on?

03:19.280 --> 03:20.800
There's an injured horse out there.

03:20.810 --> 03:22.860
- Which one?
- Shooting Star.

03:22.910 --> 03:24.270
She seemed fine in the paddock.

03:24.290 --> 03:25.590
Well, she's not, okay?

03:25.610 --> 03:27.150
She has a stress fracture
in her left fetlock.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.530
You've gotta trust me.

03:29.750 --> 03:30.550
Okay.

03:31.430 --> 03:32.950
The race is about to start.

03:32.990 --> 03:34.810
I'm gonna take your word for it.

03:34.970 --> 03:37.810
- I'm sorry, she's out.
- What?!

03:38.320 --> 03:39.770
We have a scratch in Race Six.

03:39.790 --> 03:41.460
Please bring Shooting
Star back to the paddock.

03:41.490 --> 03:42.990
Well, I hope you're happy.

03:43.180 --> 03:46.070
Pulling that horse just put
Fairfield in serious jeopardy.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.390
Along with both your reputations.

03:48.430 --> 03:50.690
I don't care who you
tell your crazy lies to.

03:50.710 --> 03:52.750
- Star's coming with us.
- No, she's not.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.600
I'm taking her back to Fairfield.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.630
You've done something,
so if it's not bute,

03:56.640 --> 03:57.920
then what is it?

03:58.050 --> 04:01.290
It's nothing. She's gonna be fine.

04:01.330 --> 04:03.790
You don't honestly believe that, do you?

04:04.430 --> 04:05.640
You know what,
you don't want to see the lengths

04:05.650 --> 04:07.220
we'll go to, to protect her!

04:21.529 --> 04:22.900
I'll give her to you.

04:23.620 --> 04:26.680
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry.

04:26.870 --> 04:29.240
I was at a concert last night
and this is gonna sound crazy,

04:29.260 --> 04:32.710
but... I got stuck in this parkade.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.700
- What?
- It's a long story.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.000
I don't wanna bore you, but I know...

04:37.050 --> 04:39.290
I know I shouldn't have been out
the night before a horse show.

04:39.330 --> 04:41.270
I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised.

04:41.550 --> 04:42.510
I thought you were taking this chance

04:42.530 --> 04:44.300
to go to Europe more seriously.

04:44.890 --> 04:46.700
But it is what it is.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.990
We'll try again for the camp next year.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.330
Wait! Wait! I...

04:51.110 --> 04:54.380
we've been busting our butts
to qualify for this year.

04:54.410 --> 04:56.010
That was the plan.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.410
Slim chance now that
you didn't show today.

04:58.510 --> 05:00.520
I'll wait for the updated
points to get posted,

05:00.530 --> 05:02.520
but... it doesn't look good.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.690
Thank God you got there in time.
How's she doing?

05:10.940 --> 05:12.500
Well, she's pretty calm right now,

05:12.520 --> 05:15.040
but that'll change once
the painkillers wear off.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.450
She's gonna start to feel
that injury in a big way.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.180
Well, you're gonna be on your own,

05:19.190 --> 05:21.280
I have to bring the grass cows home.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.150
Oh, that's right,
you're pushing the herd tomorrow,

05:23.160 --> 05:25.440
Jack, I'm sorry, I forgot.
I said I'd help you, but...

05:25.460 --> 05:27.040
No, it's fine. It's fine,

05:27.070 --> 05:29.650
you need to stay here
and deal with Star.

05:29.710 --> 05:31.750
Tim, Mitch, and I, we can handle it.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.630
Grandpa, have you told Lisa yet?

05:33.660 --> 05:35.610
No. No, I haven't.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.620
I just didn't wanna stress
her out while she's away.

05:38.650 --> 05:41.300
But she does need to know
what's going on with her horse,

05:41.310 --> 05:44.010
and about that manager over there.

05:44.170 --> 05:46.600
So I'll talk to her before
I head out in the morning.

05:46.610 --> 05:47.620
Okay.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.190
All right,
I wanna do another blood test.

05:51.470 --> 05:52.680
Come on, Star.

05:56.030 --> 05:57.230
It's Kim.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.380
Hi, are the results in yet?

06:02.050 --> 06:03.570
Really? Well, that's great.

06:03.590 --> 06:06.890
I mean, it's not perfect but at
least there's a chance, right?

06:09.220 --> 06:11.410
Okay. Yeah.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.680
Okay, I'll see you first
thing in the morning, then.

06:14.190 --> 06:16.220
Okay, thank you. Bye.

06:16.330 --> 06:19.390
- That sounded promising.
- I can still qualify.

06:19.450 --> 06:21.100
Wow. Fantastic.

06:21.140 --> 06:24.090
Yeah, but I need to win
the Rocky Mountain Classic.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.730
In two days.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.960
And I need to get first
place and nothing but.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.130
- Oh.
- It's okay.

06:30.260 --> 06:32.480
If that's what I have to do,
then that's...

06:32.580 --> 06:34.470
- that's what I'll do.
- Hey!

06:34.870 --> 06:36.000
Your lunch.

06:36.050 --> 06:38.070
I need to get a run in. I'll eat later.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.300
- I'm done too.
- All right.

06:45.090 --> 06:46.990
Wow, first place, huh?

06:47.110 --> 06:49.860
- No pressure there.
- Yeah, no kidding.

07:30.050 --> 07:34.250
So what I'm hearing
is that you might possibly,

07:34.290 --> 07:36.310
maybe want to meet our
request for more beef?

07:36.340 --> 07:38.800
No, we do, we both very much do.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.330
We're just figuring out the best way

07:40.340 --> 07:41.480
to handle it right now.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.780
Well, where does Jack stand on all this?

07:44.990 --> 07:46.010
Uh...

07:47.740 --> 07:49.190
That's what I thought.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.860
Now, looks like I'm gonna have to start

07:50.870 --> 07:52.150
looking at other ranchers.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.860
- No, we just need some time.
- You've got three days.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.110
Top you up?

07:58.170 --> 08:00.460
Oh, thanks, honey.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.730
Fred, have you met my daughter, Lou?

08:03.880 --> 08:06.290
No, uh, I haven't had the pleasure.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.830
I'm Fred Garland.

08:07.860 --> 08:09.510
Oh, you own Garland Foods.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.270
I hear you have great taste in beef.

08:15.430 --> 08:17.960
Funny. She's a businessperson too,
she owns this place,

08:17.980 --> 08:19.210
and a bunch of franchises

08:19.230 --> 08:20.350
that'll be popping up everywhere.

08:20.410 --> 08:21.930
She's got one in New York already.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.150
A real knack for business, just...

08:24.480 --> 08:27.240
I don't know,
probably Takes after her Dad.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.950
Ooh, I gotta take that.

08:33.549 --> 08:34.539
Oh...

08:36.870 --> 08:38.140
Jack. Yeah?

08:39.080 --> 08:41.000
No, we're just-we're just...
I'm just uh,

08:41.039 --> 08:43.470
organizing some things last minute.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.100
Fred, um, why the three-day deadline?

08:53.470 --> 08:54.410
Fine.

08:54.450 --> 08:58.050
Well,
I have to secure my meat supply, Mitch.

08:58.090 --> 08:59.550
You can understand that.

08:59.590 --> 09:01.910
Okay, we should uh, we should get going.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.820
We've got a big day tomorrow.
Fred, we'll be in touch.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.580
- All right.
- Look, I'd like to really make a deal

09:06.590 --> 09:09.360
with you guys, but...
the clock's ticking.

09:09.390 --> 09:11.220
Yeah, no, we understand.

09:11.660 --> 09:13.320
- Bye, hon.
- Bye, Dad.

09:16.050 --> 09:17.590
Ah, hello.

09:18.450 --> 09:19.930
What did-what did Jack want?

09:19.990 --> 09:21.050
He knows we're talking to Garland,
right?

09:21.070 --> 09:22.590
Just relax, he just let me know

09:22.600 --> 09:24.340
- that Ty can't make it tomorrow.
- Okay.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.410
- I-I don't like this.
- No big deal.

09:26.420 --> 09:27.970
I don't like sneaking
around behind Jack's back.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.450
Whatever. We wouldn't have to
if he wasn't being so stubborn.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.740
We're on the verge of losing out!

09:31.740 --> 09:34.700
I know! I... I know.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.940
We have to tell him tomorrow
on the cattle drive,

09:36.960 --> 09:38.820
- and get him on board.
- I'm just gonna make him see

09:38.830 --> 09:41.160
that he has to take a back
seat on certain things.

09:41.170 --> 09:44.110
He's not the only one who knows
how to make a deal around here.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.960
I'll get the old man to come around.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.560
Yeah well, what if you can't?

09:49.580 --> 09:51.060
Well then, he's outvoted.

09:54.910 --> 09:56.130
I'm impressed.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.520
I can show you how to do it,
if you like.

09:58.530 --> 10:01.990
No, no, I meant how you
brought this diner concept

10:02.010 --> 10:04.620
- to New York.
- How'd you know about that?

10:04.710 --> 10:07.310
As a businessman I keep
my ear to the ground

10:07.330 --> 10:09.880
for any cool entrepreneurial
success stories.

10:09.950 --> 10:12.700
- My dad told you, didn't he?
- Argh! Busted.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.930
Do you have a hand in your
family's cattle operation?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.160
Oh! No.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.760
There are enough cooks
in that kitchen already.

10:20.790 --> 10:22.980
Ah, well, I am relieved to hear that.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.870
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.890
I-I mean,
I make it a firm rule not to date anyone

10:27.900 --> 10:29.530
I'm in business with.

10:31.350 --> 10:32.570
Sorry.

10:32.610 --> 10:36.190
That was my clumsy
segue to asking you out.

10:36.990 --> 10:38.060
Oh.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.770
Look,
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.170
Here.

10:45.650 --> 10:48.560
Call me sometime if
you'd like to meet up.

10:49.220 --> 10:49.920
Okay.

11:06.430 --> 11:08.120
She's in pain, Ty.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.420
Yeah. Yeah, easy now, easy.

11:12.450 --> 11:13.340
I know.

11:14.070 --> 11:15.590
It's really kicking in now.

11:15.610 --> 11:18.420
I can't believe she actually
ran on that leg a week ago.

11:18.630 --> 11:19.980
Do you remember at the track Laura said

11:19.990 --> 11:21.710
there was no bute in her system?

11:21.830 --> 11:23.210
- Yeah.
- She was right;

11:23.230 --> 11:24.740
my blood test proved it.

11:25.540 --> 11:26.950
But she was still numb to the pain,

11:26.970 --> 11:28.640
so something's goin' on.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.390
I'm thinking Laura gave
her something else,

11:30.400 --> 11:32.590
maybe something undetectable, or...

11:32.960 --> 11:34.220
it's hard to say.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.600
Jack, have you talked to Lisa yet?

11:36.640 --> 11:40.660
No. No, I tried last night
and again this morning,

11:40.670 --> 11:44.220
but I did leave a message for
her to call you guys asap.

11:44.230 --> 11:46.610
You're gonna have to fill
her in on what's going on.

11:46.650 --> 11:49.000
Now, if she does call,

11:49.140 --> 11:51.390
tell her that I do know about Star,

11:51.980 --> 11:53.400
and...

11:53.690 --> 11:56.020
and I'm here if she wants to talk.

11:57.340 --> 11:58.470
See ya.

12:04.070 --> 12:04.690
Here.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.550
You want some of this?

12:14.500 --> 12:15.840
That's it, Georgie,

12:15.860 --> 12:17.270
stay nice and relaxed.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.500
That's it!

12:29.570 --> 12:31.480
- Ease up.
- Ah!

12:31.500 --> 12:33.200
Nice job.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.290
Bring it in.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.810
All right,
I think that's enough for today.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.970
No. I need to go again.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.400
There's no room for error tomorrow.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.430
You seem pretty worn out,
I think a little bit of rest

12:47.440 --> 12:48.530
will be better for you.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.720
- I can do that after the show.
- Georgie, rest is just...

12:50.740 --> 12:52.890
No, I wanna go to the camp!

12:52.920 --> 12:54.880
I need to! Okay?

12:54.990 --> 12:57.090
You know my Mom,
she even sold off part of her business

12:57.100 --> 12:58.670
so we can afford this.

12:59.670 --> 13:00.950
We're doing this.

13:01.220 --> 13:02.560
Okay?

13:03.970 --> 13:06.100
Fine. Let's go again.

13:07.060 --> 13:07.980
Okay...

13:12.110 --> 13:12.890
Perfect.

13:14.410 --> 13:15.840
Hey! I just wanted to check in

13:15.860 --> 13:17.040
before we head on this cattle drive,

13:17.060 --> 13:18.440
just to let you know the
horses at the Dude Ranch,

13:18.450 --> 13:19.830
they're good for the next couple days.

13:19.860 --> 13:23.110
Okay, great. Hey, why were
you guys talking to Garland

13:23.130 --> 13:24.860
without Grandpa there?

13:25.820 --> 13:29.490
Oh that, um...
that was a preliminary meeting.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.350
We're gonna fill Jack in...

13:31.840 --> 13:33.070
later.

13:33.620 --> 13:34.380
Okay.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.430
You know, speaking of Garland, I just,

13:37.460 --> 13:39.420
I-I saw that he was chatting you up.

13:39.970 --> 13:41.800
Yeah, he was, actually.

13:41.830 --> 13:44.210
- He asked me out on a date.
- Really?

13:44.250 --> 13:45.780
Yeah. I don't know if it's a good idea,

13:45.790 --> 13:48.440
I mean, he's not really my type.

13:48.580 --> 13:50.550
- What do you think?
- Uh...

13:50.580 --> 13:52.320
I mean, look at you and Maya.

13:52.380 --> 13:55.250
Complete opposites.
Totally unsuited to each other.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.250
You said so yourself, and...

13:57.480 --> 13:58.780
look at you now.

13:59.180 --> 14:00.410
Engaged.

14:01.420 --> 14:04.130
Yeah, I guess you never really know.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.190
How are the wedding plans coming?

14:06.380 --> 14:09.580
Good. Yeah, they're- they're great.

14:09.780 --> 14:13.060
I think, I guess, I don't know,
Maya's the one doing it, so...

14:13.080 --> 14:13.790
Hmm.

14:15.190 --> 14:18.400
I-I should get going,
Tim's gonna want to head out soon.

14:18.410 --> 14:20.570
- Okay.
- Bye.

14:25.390 --> 14:27.190
Hup!
Come on!

14:27.500 --> 14:29.590
Keep moving you guys, let's go!

14:33.620 --> 14:35.120
Jack, hold up, hold up.

14:36.060 --> 14:37.750
Hey! Let's go, come on!

14:37.770 --> 14:40.210
Listen, why don't you let
me TB this thing, okay?

14:40.250 --> 14:42.470
- Pardon me?
- T-Bossing.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.850
Trail bossing.
You're usually the trail boss.

14:44.890 --> 14:47.340
Sometimes, you know,
you've gotta take a step back,

14:47.350 --> 14:49.770
- let a younger guy step in.
- Oh, I do, do I?

14:49.790 --> 14:51.390
Well, I got some ideas, Jack.

14:51.420 --> 14:54.100
- It'll save us some time.
- Since when is this a race?

14:54.500 --> 14:55.750
I'm just saying, come on.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.420
You like to be out
here in the fresh air,

14:57.430 --> 14:59.030
working the herd, and I'm a busy guy.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.950
I'm not into this as
a leisurely activity.

15:00.980 --> 15:03.610
- Fine.
- Right? Really?

15:03.630 --> 15:06.040
Oh, you think you can do a better job,
you be my guest.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.620
All right.

15:09.140 --> 15:10.280
All right then.

15:17.260 --> 15:18.360
How's Star doing?

15:19.520 --> 15:22.970
Well,
she's still really favouring that leg.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.050
I really hope she can
come back from this.

15:26.060 --> 15:27.240
Me too.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.170
Star should've never raced last week.

15:30.290 --> 15:31.970
This is exactly the
thing that can happen

15:31.980 --> 15:33.810
when a horse isn't sound.

15:40.110 --> 15:43.250
Hey, lunch is almost ready. Tuna melts.

15:44.050 --> 15:46.090
What's with the face?
You love my tuna melts.

15:46.130 --> 15:48.490
I just,
I just don't really feel like it today.

15:48.630 --> 15:49.450
Well, I'm gonna head into town,

15:49.470 --> 15:51.390
you wanna do a burger instead?

15:51.510 --> 15:53.480
I'm-I'm really just not that hungry.

15:53.510 --> 15:55.090
You know what I can,
I can have one of these

15:55.110 --> 15:56.300
yogurt drinks instead.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.090
Honey,
you should probably have some real food.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.770
Yeah, you've been burning a
lot of calories these days.

16:00.830 --> 16:02.980
Can you guys please not
tell me what to eat?

16:02.990 --> 16:04.080
I'm under a lot of stress, okay,

16:04.090 --> 16:06.170
and I've got a life-changing
competition tomorrow, so...

16:06.190 --> 16:08.460
I'm sorry if I don't
have much of an appetite!

16:14.750 --> 16:16.380
Come on, Star, just...

16:17.380 --> 16:18.570
try a little bit.

16:18.690 --> 16:20.730
I have been trying to
get in touch with Ty.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.650
Why hasn't Star been
returned to Fairfield yet?

16:22.670 --> 16:24.260
Because we're busy treating her.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.250
She's in pretty bad shape,
thanks to you.

16:26.330 --> 16:27.340
Hey.

16:28.090 --> 16:30.610
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get Star.

16:30.670 --> 16:32.100
Star's staying here.

16:32.470 --> 16:34.210
I just got the bloodwork back.

16:34.310 --> 16:37.270
It's not good. Acute renal failure.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.950
Is that's why she's not eating?

16:38.990 --> 16:39.900
Yeah.

16:40.270 --> 16:42.390
What else did you do to get
her to stop feeling the pain?

16:42.420 --> 16:44.560
What? Nothing.

16:44.590 --> 16:46.170
I need to help her, Laura.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.350
She was running the race
on a really bad injury.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.910
How is that possible?

16:49.990 --> 16:52.220
It had to be more than bute,
what did you do?

16:52.370 --> 16:54.680
It was just the bute, I swear.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.170
Okay, whatever.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.470
Can you leave so we can
get our work done, please?!

17:01.460 --> 17:02.480
Fine.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.900
Is Star's life in danger?

17:08.550 --> 17:10.500
Let's just get this IV hooked up.

17:11.260 --> 17:12.609
- Quickly.
- Okay.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.390
You're okay. You're okay.

17:17.310 --> 17:18.440
Hey...

17:23.440 --> 17:25.849
You are kind of a
better drawer than I am.

17:25.869 --> 17:28.150
This is now the biggest
flower in the world.

17:28.210 --> 17:29.080
Hey.

17:29.490 --> 17:32.890
Hey, oh wow, a little dressed
up for Maggie's, aren't you?

17:33.080 --> 17:35.420
I'm actually meeting someone for coffee.

17:35.740 --> 17:38.530
Coffee, huh? You mean a date?

17:38.870 --> 17:42.180
Hey, you have marker on your cheek,
go wash it off.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.430
- Okay.
- Have fun with your Dad.

17:46.470 --> 17:48.650
Well, it's coffee with a guy,

17:48.670 --> 17:51.110
kinda like how you went
for dinner with Jen,

17:51.130 --> 17:55.080
so...
yeah, I guess you could call it a date.

17:55.110 --> 17:56.860
You like how I turned
that around on you there?

17:56.880 --> 17:58.040
Mhmm.

17:59.060 --> 18:00.600
Enjoy your coffee.

18:01.940 --> 18:02.910
Thanks.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.520
Come on, Jack, push up that drag.

18:17.540 --> 18:20.260
Pick it up back there!
Don't let 'em eat!

18:21.510 --> 18:23.620
- I got this.
- Okay.

18:23.740 --> 18:26.110
There's a new sheriff in town!

18:29.450 --> 18:30.650
This is delicious.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.910
Yeah, we make a pretty mean espresso.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.610
Well, it's definitely not your typical

18:34.620 --> 18:36.890
small town diner cup of Joe.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.050
You know, you bring a real
touch of class to that place.

18:39.140 --> 18:42.070
- Oh, I don't know about that.
- No, don't be modest.

18:42.130 --> 18:44.160
There's obviously something special

18:44.180 --> 18:46.830
- about the Lou Fleming brand.
- Thank you.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.410
And you're just scratching the surface

18:48.420 --> 18:50.700
of what you can achieve
in the business world.

18:51.460 --> 18:54.440
As a matter of fact,
I'd love to pick your brain a little

18:54.460 --> 18:56.270
on what I could do to revamp

18:56.300 --> 18:58.570
the whole grocery stores'
image a little.

18:58.590 --> 19:00.090
Sure, love to help.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.500
Revamping is part of my brand.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.650
Great, shall we?

19:04.680 --> 19:05.430
Sure.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.820
Well, you could start by
redesigning your logo.

19:10.590 --> 19:12.900
I think we should add some
devil's claw to her feed.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.890
It'll help reduce the inflammation.

19:14.910 --> 19:16.560
Uh yeah, that might help.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.050
And I wanna call Cassandra and make sure

19:19.070 --> 19:21.160
that can come out and
do some acupuncture.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.440
Sure, yeah, that couldn't hurt, either.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.100
Why are you saying it like that?

19:25.170 --> 19:26.330
Uh, like what?

19:26.380 --> 19:28.880
I don't know,
you just sound dismissive or something.

19:28.970 --> 19:31.470
No Amy, you know that I think
all that stuff is important.

19:31.510 --> 19:33.710
Wait, all of that "stuff"?

19:34.940 --> 19:36.790
Amy,
she's been so hooked on painkillers,

19:36.810 --> 19:38.520
and who knows what else,
it's just hard to imagine

19:38.530 --> 19:39.760
that any of that will make a difference.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.520
Well, you know what,
I think we should at least try.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.380
I'm sorry Amy,
but anything you do won't matter

19:43.390 --> 19:45.450
- if her kidneys fail, okay, so...
- Ty, it's okay,

19:45.480 --> 19:46.570
I've got Lyndy.

19:53.130 --> 19:56.870
And I think you should put in uh,
juice and smoothie bars

19:56.890 --> 19:58.300
with your organic ingredients.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.260
People can sip on a healthy
drink while they shop.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.700
That's a nice touch. I like that.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.640
Yeah. But um...

20:05.680 --> 20:07.840
- enough business talk.
- All right, fine.

20:07.850 --> 20:10.450
I guess I got my fill of free advice.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.420
So... what do you want to talk about?

20:13.620 --> 20:15.450
I don't know, um...

20:15.470 --> 20:16.920
read any good books lately?

20:16.950 --> 20:19.840
Yeah, I just finished a great one,
actually.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.630
It's called, "Grocery".

20:22.220 --> 20:24.020
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it's a best-seller.

20:24.130 --> 20:26.810
It's about our evolving
relationship with food,

20:26.820 --> 20:28.590
and the changing face
of the grocery store

20:28.610 --> 20:32.000
- on our cultural landscape.
- Oh that sounds... interesting.

20:32.260 --> 20:35.220
- What else do you like to do?
- I love to travel.

20:35.230 --> 20:36.290
Oh, me too.

20:36.340 --> 20:38.190
Actually,
I thinking about visiting my daughter

20:38.210 --> 20:40.770
in Europe this winter, maybe.

20:40.810 --> 20:42.070
Have you ever been?

20:42.370 --> 20:44.610
No, I-I haven't.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.520
But the whole grocery store concept

20:46.530 --> 20:48.270
- is so different over there.
- Right,

20:48.290 --> 20:50.580
but what does that have to
do with taking a vacation?

20:50.610 --> 20:52.550
Well,
I-I like to go on working holidays.

20:52.590 --> 20:54.350
- Road trips from town to town.
- Mhmm...

20:54.370 --> 20:56.040
You know, across Canada and the U.S.

20:56.050 --> 20:58.590
Let me guess,
checking out all the grocery stores?

20:58.590 --> 21:00.430
Oh yeah, but you'd be amazed
at how much I've learned,

21:00.460 --> 21:02.350
- and even borrowed.
- Hmm.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.170
There was this one time
I was in Des Moines,

21:04.200 --> 21:07.210
and I found this little
Mom and Pop operation.

21:07.230 --> 21:08.350
- Or so I thought.
- Yeah?

21:08.360 --> 21:11.370
Their refrigeration system,
it-it blew me away.

21:11.410 --> 21:12.570
I bet.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.410
You got it? Thanks.

21:24.420 --> 21:26.720
So, I heard a rumour.

21:27.820 --> 21:28.740
Yeah?

21:30.490 --> 21:31.910
About a wedding.

21:33.190 --> 21:35.690
Well,
I guess you guys could say that I uh,

21:35.730 --> 21:37.160
have some news.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.250
Um...
and you're gonna think this is crazy,

21:40.270 --> 21:42.210
we really haven't been dating that long.

21:42.240 --> 21:46.270
But Maya and I are getting married.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.380
That is crazy. What was she thinking?

21:49.400 --> 21:52.410
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Jack.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.250
You know,
and now we're all sitting around here,

21:54.260 --> 21:56.680
I think it's a great time
to talk about the business.

21:56.710 --> 21:59.110
I'm game,
as long as it has nothing to do

21:59.130 --> 22:01.130
with expanding the herd.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.390
Actually, we had a little uh,

22:06.890 --> 22:10.030
we had talk with old
man McMillan next door.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.620
He's kind of open to the idea
of us taking on his herd.

22:12.650 --> 22:14.810
Yeah, and Jack,
that way we can actually meet

22:14.830 --> 22:16.630
Garland's demand for more beef.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.880
Well, thanks for keeping me in the loop.

22:18.910 --> 22:20.870
Oh, don't get your nose out of joint.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.630
Come on, we explored the options

22:23.640 --> 22:25.640
before we brought anything back to you.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.750
You know, you haven't exactly
been open to the idea.

22:27.770 --> 22:29.840
I just don't want to sell cattle

22:29.850 --> 22:31.370
that we haven't raised ourselves.

22:31.380 --> 22:32.790
Well, that could take a long time, Jack!

22:32.810 --> 22:33.850
Yeah, and we don't have any time,

22:33.860 --> 22:35.650
Garland gave us three days.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.980
Wait a second.

22:41.030 --> 22:44.280
You two talked to Garland without me?

22:47.890 --> 22:50.030
Well, isn't that just dandy.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.240
He'll be fine.

23:28.600 --> 23:32.290
Hey, hey, it's the big day,
breakfast is on the table.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.870
Are you okay?

23:40.350 --> 23:41.480
I'm fine.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.600
No you're not, you're shaking.

23:43.650 --> 23:47.340
I'm fine, I'm just... I'm just nervous.

23:50.070 --> 23:51.070
Georgie.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.090
I need to go take a shower.

24:21.190 --> 24:23.590
- Oh...
- Hey!

24:23.940 --> 24:25.610
Good morning, you.

24:25.690 --> 24:27.650
Hey, well,
she looks a lot more comfortable.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.080
- Yeah.
- Fluids seems to be working.

24:30.270 --> 24:33.710
I also had Cassandra come
over and do some acupuncture.

24:33.730 --> 24:35.970
And I know you didn't think
it was important, but...

24:36.010 --> 24:37.750
That's not what I meant, Amy.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.670
I was just more focused
on treating her kidneys,

24:39.690 --> 24:40.740
that's all.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.210
I just think that all of
these things factor in.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.170
I know, and I didn't mean to downplay

24:45.190 --> 24:47.630
any of your suggestions, I was just...

24:48.130 --> 24:50.120
I was exhausted, and it came out wrong.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.900
Well, I've been pretty tired, too.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.500
Maybe I was a little over-sensitive.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.030
Just a little?

24:57.230 --> 24:57.960
Hey.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.260
Well,
I put some devil's claw in her feed...

25:07.900 --> 25:10.240
but it's not gonna do much
good if she's not eating.

25:10.270 --> 25:11.620
No, it's not.

25:12.170 --> 25:14.930
It's not a good sign that she's
not eating anything at all.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.580
Hey, I am so sorry I can't come watch.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.960
But we're right in the thick of it,

25:28.980 --> 25:30.920
and someone has to be
here for Katie and Lyndy.

25:30.940 --> 25:31.970
It's okay, I totally get it.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.780
You're gonna be great, just have fun.

25:33.820 --> 25:34.870
Thanks.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.360
Is she okay?

25:38.670 --> 25:41.600
I've seen her nervous,
but never like this.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.330
I'm worried.

25:44.770 --> 25:47.250
You know what,
Ty can hold down the fort here.

25:47.320 --> 25:49.320
- I'm gonna come with you guys.
- Thank you.

25:57.830 --> 25:58.900
That's a nice finish,

25:58.910 --> 26:01.220
should make up for a couple
of faults in the early going.

26:01.230 --> 26:02.520
Pretty good run.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.530
All right. You ready?

26:07.260 --> 26:08.980
Don't doubt yourself.

26:09.220 --> 26:11.340
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.550
I want you to put those
thoughts out of your head now.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.760
Because you have as
much potential as anyone

26:16.770 --> 26:18.550
I've ever coached.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.500
You can do this, Georgie.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.310
I want you to go out there,
kick some butt,

26:23.340 --> 26:25.170
and have fun doing it.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.190
Okay.

26:29.850 --> 26:31.710
Next up,
the last rider of the day,

26:31.730 --> 26:35.360
we have Georgie Fleming-Morris
on Phoenix Rising.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.280
Let's go!
Come on, Georgie!

27:23.750 --> 27:25.290
55 seconds.

27:25.330 --> 27:27.580
And that's your fastest time of the day,
folks.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.510
Put your hands together
for your winners,

27:29.530 --> 27:32.310
Georgie Fleming-Morris,
and Phoenix Rising!

27:35.300 --> 27:37.090
She's going to Europe!

27:37.320 --> 27:38.980
She's going to Europe! Oh my God!

27:39.020 --> 27:41.520
Way to go, that was amazing.

27:48.190 --> 27:50.130
I don't feel so well.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.630
Georgie, what is it?

27:58.070 --> 28:01.080
Georgie! Georgie, hey! Are you okay?

28:04.490 --> 28:06.780
- Please give us some space.
- I am her mother.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.650
- What happened here?
- She passed out.

28:09.770 --> 28:11.940
But her pulse is strong,
and she's getting some color.

28:11.950 --> 28:14.610
Is she gonna be okay?
Is there anything we can do?

28:14.650 --> 28:17.000
Uh, just give her a moment
to get her bearings.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.830
I suggest she go to the ER,
just to be safe.

28:22.190 --> 28:23.340
Okay.

28:43.210 --> 28:45.570
Hey, come on,
let's pick up the pace, huh?

28:45.630 --> 28:47.330
What are you talking about? Settle down!

28:47.340 --> 28:48.770
We're making pretty good time.

28:48.790 --> 28:50.130
Well, we can do better, okay?

28:50.150 --> 28:53.240
- I... we're gonna head west.
- What?!

28:53.270 --> 28:55.070
I know, it's not our usual route,

28:55.090 --> 28:56.720
but we're gonna save a chunk of time.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.030
You know where you are, don't you?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.510
If we head west, we're gonna run 'em

28:59.520 --> 29:02.190
right into the Thorn River!
It's like a stream right now.

29:02.220 --> 29:04.930
There's-it's...
it's shallow this time of year.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.280
I wouldn't be so sure.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.480
Did you get Georgie to bed?

29:15.500 --> 29:17.170
Yeah, she's resting.

29:18.110 --> 29:19.840
Can you believe what the doctor said?

29:19.990 --> 29:22.530
Physical and emotional exhaustion.

29:22.910 --> 29:24.200
God, I feel awful about this!

29:24.210 --> 29:25.640
Yeah, but it's not your fault, Lou.

29:25.660 --> 29:27.950
It is Amy, I should've seen it coming.

29:27.970 --> 29:29.280
I mean, all the signs are there,

29:29.300 --> 29:31.910
She's been under an
enormous amount of pressure,

29:31.930 --> 29:34.830
she's hardly been eating,
she hasn't been herself.

29:34.970 --> 29:37.350
How did I miss all the signs?

29:37.990 --> 29:39.710
The one thing I'm sure
of is it all started

29:39.720 --> 29:41.260
with this new coach.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.300
Anyway, Peter's waiting for me.

29:43.310 --> 29:45.330
We're gonna go have a chat with Kim.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.460
Thank you for your text,
I'm so glad she's okay.

29:52.530 --> 29:55.590
No, she's not okay, Kim.
None of this is okay.

29:55.610 --> 29:57.270
Her body just shut down

29:57.290 --> 29:58.950
because of all the
stress she's been under.

29:58.980 --> 30:01.060
Do you have any idea how
hard she's been working

30:01.080 --> 30:03.990
- to live up to your standards?
- My standards?

30:04.020 --> 30:06.470
Yeah, she puts you up on a pedestal.

30:06.570 --> 30:08.030
She thinks if she does
everything you tell her

30:08.040 --> 30:10.740
then she'll win, and she'll get
to go to this camp in Europe.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.110
Exactly. And look what it's done to her!

30:13.180 --> 30:14.980
Like any of my riders,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.950
I have given her the tools
to compete at this level.

30:18.300 --> 30:21.770
I agree she has been under a
tremendous amount of pressure.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.540
But it hasn't been coming from me.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.100
She's been putting it on herself.

30:25.110 --> 30:27.870
- So this is all on Georgie?
- Not entirely.

30:27.980 --> 30:29.950
Georgie told me that you
sold off your business

30:29.970 --> 30:32.020
so that she could afford this camp.

30:32.850 --> 30:34.910
She really didn't wanna let you down.

30:35.720 --> 30:36.550
What?!

30:37.460 --> 30:38.770
Excuse me.

30:44.820 --> 30:47.310
Why would Georgie think
that I sold Maggie's

30:47.320 --> 30:49.190
so she can go to Europe?

30:49.470 --> 30:51.260
I don't-I have no idea.

30:51.330 --> 30:53.550
Oh my God,
I completely dropped the ball on this.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.500
No, we both did. Hey.

30:55.610 --> 30:57.000
You know, here I thought my big windfall

30:57.010 --> 30:59.770
was gonna be the answer to
all of Georgie's dreams.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.640
I should've realized
the amount of pressure

31:01.650 --> 31:03.510
that would put on her!

31:04.640 --> 31:06.190
God, she's just a kid!

31:06.210 --> 31:09.740
Hey. Lou, this is not your fault.

31:10.220 --> 31:13.090
Okay?
Georgie got carried away with all this.

31:13.170 --> 31:14.710
What we have to do right now

31:14.730 --> 31:16.800
is help her get healthy again.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.870
Together.

31:19.640 --> 31:21.980
Yeah. You're right.

31:22.740 --> 31:24.210
We can do this.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.530
Come here.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.370
We can do this.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.100
It's gonna be fine.

31:31.150 --> 31:34.510
It's okay, it's okay.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.950
You're a good girl.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.210
Good girl.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.710
Look, before you say anything,

31:49.720 --> 31:52.300
I-I know what I did was wrong.

31:52.330 --> 31:54.070
I never meant to hurt Star.

31:54.090 --> 31:55.940
But you cannot cut me out like this!

31:55.980 --> 31:57.860
Well you're not going anywhere near her.

31:57.930 --> 31:59.240
You're the reason she's
fighting for her life

31:59.250 --> 32:00.610
in the first place.

32:01.610 --> 32:02.620
Hey!

32:03.130 --> 32:04.910
You have to let me see her.

32:05.510 --> 32:07.160
Tell her that she's gonna be okay.

32:08.410 --> 32:09.630
Hey...

32:12.030 --> 32:15.040
Ty, I think maybe...
maybe she could help us.

32:19.110 --> 32:19.950
Hey...

32:24.440 --> 32:26.520
We've been trying to get her to eat.

32:27.020 --> 32:28.080
Okay.

32:30.230 --> 32:31.470
Hey, Star.

32:34.490 --> 32:36.300
How are you? Ohh...

32:38.300 --> 32:39.980
Come on, you wanna try?

32:40.940 --> 32:42.180
Try, try.

32:42.250 --> 32:44.990
Yeah. Yeah!

32:46.270 --> 32:48.030
It's good, right?

32:49.180 --> 32:50.750
I think she ate some.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.640
Just a little bit.

32:54.660 --> 32:56.280
Try some more.

32:57.610 --> 32:58.830
Hey...

33:03.190 --> 33:06.060
Mom? Dad?

33:21.280 --> 33:24.280
Hey, it's Wyatt,
I'll get back to you soon.

33:24.310 --> 33:25.880
Probably.

33:27.350 --> 33:28.780
Hey, Wyatt.

33:29.010 --> 33:30.610
Um, it's Georgie.

33:31.870 --> 33:34.980
Would you be able to give me a call?

33:35.560 --> 33:36.800
Thanks.

34:03.980 --> 34:06.050
It's not what you thought, is it?

34:06.850 --> 34:08.110
What do you mean?

34:08.150 --> 34:10.170
Too deep, and it's moving too fast.

34:10.190 --> 34:11.500
We gotta turn 'em around.

34:11.540 --> 34:13.340
No, we'll just get the leaders to cross,

34:13.350 --> 34:14.870
the others will follow.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.270
You just keep 'em forward.

34:25.370 --> 34:27.550
Hup! Hup! Let's go!

34:28.179 --> 34:29.840
Come on! Get! Hey!

34:29.880 --> 34:31.980
Come on! Hoo!

34:33.090 --> 34:35.719
Come on! Hoo! Let's go!

34:48.100 --> 34:50.230
Get 'em, boys, cut him off!

34:51.699 --> 34:53.770
Get up that flank, Tim,
circle him around!

34:53.790 --> 34:56.070
I'm on it! Come on!

35:09.480 --> 35:11.290
Hey! Hey! Hey!

35:16.490 --> 35:19.160
Well, that was intense.

35:19.370 --> 35:21.390
We shouldn'tve tried that crossing.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.320
Well, it wasn't supposed to be so deep.

35:23.340 --> 35:25.290
Yeah well,
I don't care what you thought,

35:25.330 --> 35:27.400
- we're changing course.
- Who says?

35:27.530 --> 35:28.450
I say!

35:28.590 --> 35:30.970
Well, what you say isn't always right,
Jack.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.850
Not about our herd,
not about the business.

35:34.070 --> 35:36.390
You know, this whole deal
with Garland is gonna go south

35:36.410 --> 35:37.340
because you're messing it up,

35:37.350 --> 35:39.190
and then what are Mitch
and I supposed to do, huh?

35:39.210 --> 35:40.470
Sit around and watch?!

35:41.370 --> 35:44.700
We're pushing 'em back north,
and we're doing it right now!

35:52.690 --> 35:55.350
I'm sorry... for everything.

35:55.380 --> 35:58.020
You have nothing to apologize for.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.250
We feel really badly
about all the pressure

36:02.260 --> 36:03.950
that you've been under.

36:04.170 --> 36:06.650
And we also realize that you know,

36:06.690 --> 36:08.170
we've been a part of that.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.040
We're so proud of you.

36:10.130 --> 36:12.170
The way you've worked at this.

36:12.410 --> 36:15.140
But what's most
important is your health.

36:15.330 --> 36:17.620
You know, it's our job to keep you safe.

36:17.650 --> 36:19.440
And we're glad that you won,

36:20.320 --> 36:22.780
but is this European camp

36:22.800 --> 36:24.990
really what's best for you right now?

36:25.020 --> 36:26.220
You don't think I should go?

36:26.240 --> 36:29.100
No, we'll support you
in whatever you decide.

36:29.330 --> 36:32.050
We wanna make sure that
you're going for you,

36:32.300 --> 36:35.210
not for us, and not for me.

36:35.830 --> 36:38.230
Georgie, I didn't sell my
shares in Maggie's New York

36:38.250 --> 36:40.760
to send you to this camp in Europe.

36:40.890 --> 36:43.260
I sold it for a lot of reasons,

36:43.450 --> 36:47.140
and the biggest one was to be
home more with you and Katie.

36:47.710 --> 36:49.770
So I'm glad that I can help with Europe,

36:49.790 --> 36:53.650
but at the end of the day,
it's your choice.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.550
There you go.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.100
Good girl.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.640
I got the results from the
blood I took this morning.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.250
She's rebounding.

37:13.290 --> 37:15.340
So her kidneys are okay?

37:15.540 --> 37:16.740
Yeah, it's looking good.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.660
I will take a bit of time, though.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.930
That's such a relief.

37:23.140 --> 37:25.300
You know, Laura,
I think we can handle it from here.

37:26.150 --> 37:27.240
Ty...

37:28.080 --> 37:29.060
No.

37:29.900 --> 37:31.400
No, he's uh...

37:31.690 --> 37:32.890
he's right,

37:33.960 --> 37:35.250
I should go.

37:36.460 --> 37:37.450
Thanks.

37:41.740 --> 37:44.830
You know, Laura actually did help Star.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.920
Laura's the only reason
that Star needed any help

37:46.930 --> 37:47.960
in the first place.

37:47.980 --> 37:49.660
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

37:50.470 --> 37:53.420
Star just took comfort in
someone that was familiar.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.910
It's okay.

38:00.680 --> 38:04.180
Well, looks like we took
a shortcut after all, huh?

38:04.220 --> 38:06.090
Yeah, just not the one you thought.

38:06.110 --> 38:07.990
Yeah, you'll never let me forget it.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.430
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

38:09.520 --> 38:13.330
I won't bring it up,
if you don't go trying to...

38:13.360 --> 38:16.120
take my job as trail boss again.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.500
Huh. Maybe not 'til next year.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.850
Come on, there you go!

38:41.050 --> 38:43.870
I knew in my gut it was a mistake.

38:43.950 --> 38:46.490
Yeah, okay, I screwed up, big deal.

38:46.530 --> 38:48.510
I'm not talking about the cattle drive,

38:48.530 --> 38:52.660
I'm talking about Garland,
and expanding the herd.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.630
No, I made a decision.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.480
We're not doing it.

38:57.510 --> 39:00.840
You made a decision? About our herd?

39:00.870 --> 39:04.470
I don't wanna jeopardize the
quality of our beef, Tim.

39:04.530 --> 39:07.300
And things tend to go wrong
when you take shortcuts,

39:07.320 --> 39:10.080
and now I am talking
about the cattle drive.

39:10.210 --> 39:11.710
It's a partnership, Jack.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.050
Mitch and I wanna grow the business,
so...

39:15.120 --> 39:17.450
- you're outnumbered.
- Actually...

39:17.960 --> 39:19.730
I think Jack makes a pretty good point.

39:19.750 --> 39:24.430
I-I think we should all just
think about this together.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.650
Garland's not gonna wait, you heard him.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.370
He wants our beef,
so maybe he's bluffing.

39:30.470 --> 39:32.070
I just, I think we all

39:32.090 --> 39:33.860
have to be on the same
page for this thing.

39:35.810 --> 39:36.840
Great.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.200
That's great.

39:38.540 --> 39:40.510
So you're afraid to go big,

39:40.540 --> 39:42.760
and now you've rubbed off on him.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.390
Come on.

39:57.540 --> 39:59.510
I just came to say goodbye to Star.

39:59.880 --> 40:00.860
Why goodbye?

40:00.870 --> 40:03.670
I've sent in my
resignation letter to Lisa.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.560
So you think we're just
gonna let you move on

40:05.570 --> 40:08.440
- to another stable?
- No, of course not.

40:08.470 --> 40:09.160
But...

40:10.310 --> 40:12.230
I'm taking some time
away from this whole...

40:12.260 --> 40:14.620
racing racket for a little while.

40:15.940 --> 40:19.100
I got into this because I-I love horses.

40:19.830 --> 40:21.740
It's just somewhere along the way...

40:23.340 --> 40:24.470
I screwed up.

40:25.550 --> 40:27.420
I-I don't want you to worry
about any of those things

40:27.430 --> 40:29.990
that I said, I'm not going
to throw you under the bus.

40:30.810 --> 40:32.870
I know how much you must hate me.

40:33.540 --> 40:36.240
But I really,
I feel horrible about this.

40:36.290 --> 40:38.520
Can I please, can I go in and see her?

40:37.290 --> 40:39.900
Hold on a sec, just... Laura.

40:40.750 --> 40:43.300
I wanna know what you did, okay?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.610
What else did you give Star?

40:46.670 --> 40:49.460
- I already told you.
- Come on.

40:50.430 --> 40:52.140
No BS, all right?

40:53.140 --> 40:53.900
Tell me.

40:56.490 --> 40:57.320
Okay.

40:58.980 --> 41:03.010
Um... I gave her the bute
just to numb the pain

41:03.020 --> 41:06.170
in training, or after a race.

41:06.780 --> 41:08.780
But I knew it would show
up on the doping tests

41:08.790 --> 41:10.910
if I administered it
too close to a race.

41:10.930 --> 41:16.460
So... I also used a healing method.

41:17.580 --> 41:20.090
- Shockwave therapy.
- Are you kidding me?!

41:20.100 --> 41:23.370
Shockwave therapy?
That's illegal, Laura!

41:23.400 --> 41:25.430
Sending shockwaves through the horses'
leg

41:25.450 --> 41:27.540
with little probes,
that's not a healing method!

41:27.590 --> 41:28.800
That's dangerous!

41:28.840 --> 41:30.630
You need to leave!

41:31.560 --> 41:32.690
Right now.

41:32.870 --> 41:33.820
Okay.

41:35.720 --> 41:36.840
Now.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.990
Oh hey, how'd it go?

41:54.100 --> 41:56.340
It was uh, it was interesting.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.520
Can I uh,
can I talk to you for a second?

42:00.600 --> 42:03.510
Sure, yeah. What about?

42:03.570 --> 42:04.860
Garland.

42:05.380 --> 42:08.250
And the whole-the date
thing you asked me about.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.020
I don't think it's a very good idea.

42:10.060 --> 42:12.390
Just because we're in
business together and all.

42:12.430 --> 42:13.750
Oh, well...

42:13.930 --> 42:17.270
- I already did.
- Wow, so how...

42:17.290 --> 42:19.640
how did... how did it go?

42:19.680 --> 42:22.780
Good, yeah, it was...
It was pretty good, actually.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.500
He's very passionate...

42:27.320 --> 42:28.880
about his stores.

42:30.980 --> 42:32.980
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:33.030 --> 42:34.890
We are gonna go make my mother's famous

42:34.910 --> 42:37.080
- chicken noodle soup.
- Oh yes!

42:37.180 --> 42:39.050
Good idea, let's do this!

42:39.800 --> 42:41.140
All ready to go?

42:41.150 --> 42:42.710
I filled it up with water.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.650
- Wow!
- All right.

42:43.670 --> 42:44.540
Get a pot! Get a pot!

42:44.560 --> 42:46.090
Yeah, I've got one right here!

42:48.410 --> 42:51.290
- All these carrots?
- Some of them.

42:51.550 --> 42:52.480
Your Mom's bugging me already.

42:52.510 --> 42:54.630
- How many onions do you have?
- One.

42:54.670 --> 42:55.760
Wow.

43:01.010 --> 43:03.010
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:04.180 --> 43:06.920
I thought we could all
use a little fresh air.

43:07.350 --> 43:08.520
Yeah.

43:09.070 --> 43:12.340
It's true,
and Star's looking a lot better.

43:12.530 --> 43:16.490
Yeah, she's gettin' there.
She still has a ways to go.

43:18.100 --> 43:19.740
Yeah, I get that.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.460
I'm sorry I've been a
bit of a disaster lately.

43:25.500 --> 43:26.620
A bit?

43:29.670 --> 43:32.100
It's good to see you smile again.

43:32.140 --> 43:33.250
Thanks.
