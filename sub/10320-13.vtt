01:00.646 --> 01:02.397
Thank you all for coming.

01:02.606 --> 01:05.651
And without further ado,
we officially open...

01:05.734 --> 01:07.736
- Harmon...
- Fuller...

01:07.945 --> 01:09.613
Pet Care.

01:14.785 --> 01:16.810
Did you get the picture
for our website?

01:16.835 --> 01:18.562
I thought you were getting it.

01:18.622 --> 01:19.623
I thought you were.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.418
It's okay.
We'll re-stuff the confetti cannons.

01:23.502 --> 01:25.128
Oh, yeah. Attention, everyone.

01:25.337 --> 01:28.924
I will be coming around the room and
collecting the confetti from your hair.

01:30.258 --> 01:33.595
- We're in business, partner.
- Congratulations.

01:34.554 --> 01:37.683
Hey, congratulations, D.J.

01:38.475 --> 01:42.062
Oh, you didn't notice that
we were in the middle of a hug?

01:42.270 --> 01:44.230
Gee, I must have missed that.

01:44.314 --> 01:48.109
Anyway, just came by to wish you
good luck with the new pet clinic.

01:48.318 --> 01:51.571
Oh! Thanks, Steve. That's big of you.

01:51.780 --> 01:54.783
Oh, no, no. I'm wishing D.J.
good luck with the clinic.

01:54.867 --> 01:56.535
I'm wishing you would go back to Miami

01:56.618 --> 01:59.371
and return to your career
as an underwear model.

01:59.579 --> 02:01.832
Those bikini briefs
put me through vet school.

02:03.834 --> 02:06.879
- How did you even know that?
- I remember you from the box.

02:07.671 --> 02:09.548
Okay, grand opening, take two.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.466
Everybody, smile.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.601
I got my wedding dress.

02:21.685 --> 02:24.855
I can't believe
I'm marrying Fernando again tomorrow.

02:26.732 --> 02:28.734
Yeah, I can't believe it, either.

02:30.235 --> 02:33.279
What's the rush?
You just got engaged yesterday.

02:33.363 --> 02:36.950
Since Jesse and Becky are coming up
to renew their wedding vows,

02:37.034 --> 02:40.412
Fernando and I could just piggyback
right onto their ceremony.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.582
Everyone's a winner.

02:44.833 --> 02:47.168
Except Jesse and Becky.

02:49.046 --> 02:51.361
Do they know about
this double ceremony?

02:51.386 --> 02:52.157
Nope.

02:53.884 --> 02:56.095
I'm waiting for the perfect time
to tell them,

02:56.177 --> 02:58.263
like when they're
walking down the aisle.

02:59.890 --> 03:01.307
Hey, now!

03:14.863 --> 03:17.741
Thank you so much for letting us
renew our vows here.

03:17.950 --> 03:20.744
Gibbler Style has planned
a beautiful weekend for you

03:20.827 --> 03:22.996
to celebrate 25 years of marriage.

03:23.204 --> 03:26.249
It better be a whole lot of Style
and very little Gibbler.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.377
Come upstairs
and I'll show you your love nest.

03:29.586 --> 03:30.879
Alright, I...

03:30.963 --> 03:32.714
I like love nests.

03:32.923 --> 03:35.008
No, it's okay. I'm good.

03:38.470 --> 03:40.889
Wow, beautiful.

03:42.307 --> 03:43.558
Why, thank you.

03:43.642 --> 03:46.394
No, not the room, my hair.
I love my hair.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.314
Kimmy, we love the room.

03:49.397 --> 03:52.943
It's like our own
little honeymoon suite on steroids.

03:53.152 --> 03:55.988
Jesse put that photo above our bed.

03:57.197 --> 04:00.075
Thank you so much
for arranging this romantic weekend

04:00.159 --> 04:02.619
that's all about just the two of us.

04:04.412 --> 04:08.792
About that "just the two of us" thing...
I have a wonderful surprise.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.921
Ah, my fellow groom.

04:13.672 --> 04:17.300
- What's a "fallow-groo"?
- You are my fellow groom.

04:19.178 --> 04:22.222
What's this man saying?
And why is this man kissing me?

04:22.305 --> 04:27.519
We are getting married together
in a beautiful double ceremony.

04:29.188 --> 04:31.148
Surprise!

04:31.940 --> 04:35.735
Adding a real wedding
could make our day extra romantic.

04:38.571 --> 04:41.867
Or it's a sneaky way for them
to get me to pay for their wedding.

04:42.659 --> 04:44.953
Good news. It's both!

04:46.830 --> 04:50.250
I must marry Kimberlina
as soon as possible.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.545
Our marriage will be new and improved.

04:53.628 --> 04:56.589
Before, I was always away racing cars.

04:56.673 --> 04:57.716
But from now on,

04:57.799 --> 05:01.427
you and Ramona will be with me
on the racing circuit,

05:02.095 --> 05:03.680
glued to my side.

05:03.889 --> 05:08.393
<i>Señor</i> Gibbler,
that's a very moving speech. I think.

05:10.229 --> 05:11.980
But I didn't agree to anything yet.

05:12.189 --> 05:14.440
I'll give you a discount.
The Kimmy Special.

05:14.649 --> 05:17.986
And later tonight,
I'll give you the Becky Special.

05:21.114 --> 05:22.741
Oh, mercy.

05:24.284 --> 05:25.702
Come to your fallow-groo.

05:25.911 --> 05:27.746
Thank you, Uncle Jesse.

05:27.954 --> 05:30.123
Again with the kissing.
No, no, no more kissing.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.332
I'm not your uncle.

05:31.541 --> 05:34.669
You're everyone's uncle.
You're Uncle Jesse!

05:39.340 --> 05:43.511
- Aww, Jess. A candlelit dinner.
- Yep.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.765
The exact same meal
we had on our very first date.

05:49.893 --> 05:51.311
Double cheeseburgers!

05:51.519 --> 05:54.564
- Extra pickles, no onions.
- Extra pickles, no onions.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.943
Oh, you are such a romantic.

05:58.026 --> 05:59.611
We met here 28 years ago.

05:59.694 --> 06:02.948
When I looked into your eyes,
I knew you were the one.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.285
I felt the same way,

06:06.367 --> 06:07.994
about two years later.

06:10.371 --> 06:13.416
But we're still here
and more in love than ever.

06:14.667 --> 06:15.626
Gosh, how do we do it?

06:15.651 --> 06:17.611
Because we always
put each other first.

06:17.796 --> 06:19.380
That is our secret.

06:22.467 --> 06:25.262
- Ready for Kimmy's bachelorette party?
- Yep. Let's go.

06:27.264 --> 06:30.642
- What about putting each other first?
- It's your turn to put me first.

06:32.518 --> 06:35.272
- We won't be late, right, girls?
- No.

06:35.355 --> 06:36.856
- Ready?
- Bye, honey.

06:38.191 --> 06:39.651
Hey, Uncle Jesse, do me a favor.

06:39.734 --> 06:43.280
Tommy wants a double cheeseburger.
Throw it in the blender first.

06:43.488 --> 06:44.489
Yeah.

06:46.741 --> 06:48.327
Uncle Jesse, got a minute?

06:48.534 --> 06:50.745
Apparently I have all night.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.249
So, do you know Ramona's friend, Lola?

06:54.333 --> 06:55.334
No, I don't.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.210
Well, she is hot.

06:57.877 --> 07:00.505
I want to make a move.
And you're the king of moves.

07:02.924 --> 07:04.176
What idiot told you that?

07:04.884 --> 07:06.427
- You did.
- Oh.

07:07.512 --> 07:09.639
You're in luck.
There's a wedding tomorrow.

07:09.722 --> 07:12.309
Girls love weddings.
So invite her to the wedding, right?

07:12.392 --> 07:14.769
You get her to the wedding,
you let the music play,

07:14.853 --> 07:16.229
let all the romance take over.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.982
You grab her hand like this
and you give it a little kiss.

07:21.026 --> 07:22.986
If she gets all caught
up in the romance,

07:23.069 --> 07:25.989
then you move in for the big one
that goes something like this.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.084
Do I have to blow on her belly?

07:38.293 --> 07:40.879
That move may be
a little advanced for you.

07:41.546 --> 07:43.673
I smell Mickey D's.

07:43.756 --> 07:45.384
Help yourself.

07:46.426 --> 07:47.969
I got some bad news for you guys.

07:48.178 --> 07:51.556
After the wedding, Papa said
that me and my mom are moving out.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.725
I get my own room back? Awesome!

07:55.310 --> 07:58.146
I mean, gee,
I'm really going to miss you.

07:59.064 --> 08:02.483
You and Kimmy are moving out?
Why was I not consulted?

08:02.692 --> 08:04.527
I just found out.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.905
I'm psyched for my family
getting back together,

08:06.988 --> 08:08.865
but I'm actually going to miss you guys.

08:09.074 --> 08:11.451
Except you.
I don't really know you at all.

08:12.869 --> 08:15.621
Well, I'm Uncle Jesse.
I'm everyone's uncle.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.711
Important thing is I get my room back.
I'll help you pack.

08:23.422 --> 08:27.342
Pardon my French,
but this is bull-baloney.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.804
Let me see. You got any teeth?
Ah, you got a tooth.

08:31.888 --> 08:33.681
We don't need a blender. Here.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.772
Go ahead.

08:47.153 --> 08:48.654
Oh, you want mine now.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.165

09:16.557 --> 09:18.458
It's 2:00 a.m. Why don't
you tell me where

09:18.483 --> 09:20.294
you were, where you really, really were?

09:21.062 --> 09:22.481
We were at a dance recital.

09:23.898 --> 09:27.568
An all-male Australian dance recital.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.952
Come on. I can't wait
to get you upstairs.

09:36.161 --> 09:38.497
Yeah, you did promise me
the Becky Special.

09:39.498 --> 09:40.748
Not you. Tommy.

09:41.791 --> 09:45.962
Aunt Becky is going
to tuck you into bed. Yes.

09:46.045 --> 09:48.756
Come on. This was supposed
to be our romantic weekend.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.551
Don't make me give myself
the Becky Special.

09:54.053 --> 09:56.139
Ooh, ooh, let's call Michelle.

09:56.222 --> 09:57.432
Oh, yeah.

09:58.099 --> 10:00.560
Oh, it's five in the
morning in New York.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.145
Ah, perfect.

10:03.396 --> 10:04.897
Ah, voice mail.

10:06.941 --> 10:08.943
Why you not come to my wedding?

10:09.819 --> 10:11.571
You're in big trouble, mister!

10:13.532 --> 10:15.367
No way, Jose!

10:16.159 --> 10:17.994
Aw, nuts!

10:19.162 --> 10:21.289
You got it, dude!

10:22.790 --> 10:25.835
Oh, oh, now we've got
to call Kathy Santoni. Yeah.

10:26.627 --> 10:27.962
Gotta call everybody tonight

10:28.046 --> 10:31.007
because tomorrow I'll be married
and back living with Fernando,

10:31.090 --> 10:33.343
and then it's bye-bye, She-Wolf Pack.

10:33.552 --> 10:38.890
Oh, no, no, no, She-Wolf Pack is
forever. No matter where we are.

10:39.098 --> 10:41.351
- Aw.
- Oh, She-Wolf Pack howl!

10:44.687 --> 10:48.316
Aw, we should drink all the time.

10:49.901 --> 10:52.987
So Deej, who are you bringing
to my wedding? Matt or Steve?

10:54.030 --> 10:55.948
- It's like <i>The Bachelorette.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

10:56.741 --> 11:00.245
No, I'm going solo. Okay,
I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

11:00.453 --> 11:03.415
But that's the best part
of <i>The Bachelorette.</i>

11:04.165 --> 11:06.918
You want to see some guy crying
in the back of a limo.

11:08.545 --> 11:11.005
Just pick Steve. He's super cute.

11:11.214 --> 11:14.675
No, no, no, pick Matt. He's super sexy.

11:15.385 --> 11:17.345
I just need to listen to my heart.

11:18.346 --> 11:22.016
Well, if you listen to some other parts
of your body, you'll pick Matt.

11:23.309 --> 11:24.644
- Night, little sis.
- Night.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.521
- Come on, roomie.
- Night, Kimmy.

11:26.605 --> 11:28.147
Come on.

11:32.944 --> 11:35.321
<i>When you hear the beep, speak.</i>

11:36.822 --> 11:39.117
<i>Not you, Rusty. The caller.</i>

11:39.200 --> 11:42.828
Hey, yo, Matt. It's... it's Stephanie,
D.J.'s little sister.

11:42.912 --> 11:45.081
You need to get your butt
over here tomorrow.

11:45.164 --> 11:48.293
You're going to be D.J.'s date
for Kimmy's wedding. Okay? Alright.

11:48.376 --> 11:49.710
Go Team Matt!

11:51.588 --> 11:54.466
Be up in a minute.
I need some... cheese.

11:55.258 --> 11:58.219
Not too much. We're sharing a bed.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.723
Hey, Steve.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.018
Sorry to wake you up.
But great news.

12:06.227 --> 12:08.647
You're D.J.'s date
for my wedding tomorrow.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.524
Yes, I've been drinking.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.988
And, yes, gifts are welcome.

12:18.448 --> 12:20.617
We could really use a cheese knife.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.541
Honey, I love that you're going
to be part of my wedding.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.251
You missed the first one.

12:31.586 --> 12:33.672
But only by a couple of weeks.

12:34.464 --> 12:36.716
Can't Papa move in with us?

12:36.799 --> 12:40.679
I can't believe I'm going to say this,
but I like living here.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.639
It's fun being part of a big family.

12:42.847 --> 12:46.976
Aw, sweetheart. You don't have
to live here to be part of this family.

12:48.394 --> 12:50.438
I've been barging in here for 30 years.

12:51.731 --> 12:54.817
Ramona, you know Lola.
Which tie would she like?

12:55.610 --> 12:57.529
The one without the Santa Claus.

12:58.988 --> 13:01.782
I'll go with my J-Money money tie.

13:01.866 --> 13:05.411
Oh, and just so you know... Max says
he's not coming to your wedding.

13:06.204 --> 13:07.413
What?

13:07.497 --> 13:08.914
He ordered the swordfish.

13:11.292 --> 13:13.378
Max, is something wrong?

13:13.586 --> 13:16.964
Please don't marry Fernando.

13:17.048 --> 13:19.300
I don't want you and Ramona to leave.

13:20.343 --> 13:21.469
Oh, Max.

13:22.303 --> 13:24.222
We're still going to see each other.

13:24.305 --> 13:28.100
But you've got to come to my wedding.
I saved the most important job for you.

13:28.309 --> 13:31.896
You have to be
my "Lord of the Wedding Rings."

13:32.897 --> 13:34.399
Like Frodo?

13:35.191 --> 13:36.192
Exactly.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.819
You're going to walk down the aisle,
just like Frodo did,

13:38.903 --> 13:43.866
when he delivered the golden rings to
King Fernando and Uncle Jesse, the Elf.

13:44.701 --> 13:47.036
I don't think you saw the movie.

13:48.079 --> 13:51.957
Can Tommy help me?
'Cause Frodo had Samwise Gamgee.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.585
That's a great idea.

13:54.419 --> 13:56.087
I love you, Kimmy.

13:56.295 --> 13:57.296
Aw.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.132
I love you, too, Max.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.885
I'll try not to cry.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.222
It's okay. Everybody cries at weddings.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.185
Sometimes they even cry a little
before the wedding.

14:13.479 --> 14:14.939
I got it.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.608
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

14:18.276 --> 14:19.277
Hi.

14:19.485 --> 14:24.156
Oh, I guess I'm early for the wedding,
but I wasn't given a specific time.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.411
Given a specific time by who?

14:32.164 --> 14:32.998
Freeze.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.252
What did you do?

14:37.336 --> 14:38.630
I did nothing.

14:38.713 --> 14:41.674
It was the five tequila shots
that did the inviting.

14:46.805 --> 14:48.765
What is he doing here?

14:52.226 --> 14:56.063
- Freeze.
- Oh, why is that so effective?

14:56.856 --> 14:58.858
Did you do what I think you did?

14:59.651 --> 15:01.653
I plead the fifth tequila.

15:04.155 --> 15:06.491
Well, you three probably
want to be alone.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.451
Oh, yeah. Don't let us intrude.

15:09.535 --> 15:11.370
Freeze.

15:11.579 --> 15:13.122
I knew it wouldn't work forever.

15:14.833 --> 15:15.834
I gotta say,

15:16.041 --> 15:19.128
this whole Matt or Steve thing
is really starting to get to me.

15:19.211 --> 15:21.213
Some nights I'm having trouble sleeping.

15:21.297 --> 15:23.842
Me too. Are you getting acid reflux?

15:25.301 --> 15:27.386
Big time. Rolaid?

15:27.470 --> 15:30.222
Ah, yes. Yes, please. Thank you.

15:31.766 --> 15:34.268
Wow, such fast relief.

15:37.062 --> 15:42.360
Deej, Matt is obviously a great guy
and easy on the eyes.

15:44.195 --> 15:45.946
I'm clearly the better match for you,

15:46.155 --> 15:48.949
but you've just got
to make a decision already.

15:49.158 --> 15:51.494
And I agree.

15:51.577 --> 15:55.373
I mean, Steve is...
well, he's cute as a puppy.

15:56.624 --> 16:01.086
Plus, he was your first boyfriend.
But... who knows?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.506
I might just be your last.

16:05.341 --> 16:08.720
After the wedding,
I promise I'll make a decision.

16:08.803 --> 16:10.471
- Okay, good.
- Great.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.817
Gibbler Style Party Planning
is pleased to announce

16:23.025 --> 16:26.696
that officiating today's double ceremony
is the Right Reverend Gladstone!

16:32.326 --> 16:36.330
Bless you, bless you, bless you all.

16:39.375 --> 16:42.169
My sons, are you ready to drop the puck?

16:43.588 --> 16:48.384
Joey, I'm glad you're finally embracing
your female side. It's a nice dress.

16:49.093 --> 16:51.679
Well, Jess,
in order to get my minister's license,

16:51.763 --> 16:54.933
I started a religion
inspired by my love of hockey.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.393
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

16:58.185 --> 17:02.607
I call it Our Lady of the Holy Goalie.

17:02.815 --> 17:05.401
Now that's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.452
I am Lord of the Rings,

17:14.535 --> 17:17.329
accompanied by my faithful companion...

17:18.329 --> 17:20.165
Tomwise Gamgee.

17:22.585 --> 17:26.088
I have no idea what you're talking about.
But can we have the rings, please?

17:26.171 --> 17:27.172
Thank you.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.300
You can sit down now.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.510
That was the whole deal?

17:32.762 --> 17:36.015
- I put on my church clothes for this?
- Yeah.

17:40.895 --> 17:42.897
And to welcome our brides,

17:42.981 --> 17:46.025
I'd like to sing a song that I wrote
especially for Jesse and Becky,

17:46.108 --> 17:49.695
and, as it turns out,
for Fernando and Kimmy.

Thank you, Steph.

18:59.057 --> 19:00.725
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here

19:00.808 --> 19:06.064
to celebrate 25 years of marital bliss
between Jesse and Becky,

19:06.146 --> 19:07.648
teammates for life.

19:09.025 --> 19:12.820
And Fernando and Kimmy,
who after a two-day intermission,

19:12.904 --> 19:14.739
are ready for a rematch.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.994
Couple number one, recite your vows.

19:20.078 --> 19:21.286
Ow!

19:22.287 --> 19:23.539
Come on.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.000
Becky,

19:26.084 --> 19:29.795
you're everything I've ever dreamed of
and more than I deserve.

19:29.879 --> 19:32.090
I love you now, and
I'd love you forever.

19:32.297 --> 19:35.885
Aw, Jess,
I am the luckiest woman on earth.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.845
I love spending every day with you.

19:37.929 --> 19:40.973
I love laughing with you.
I love loving you.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.269
Thank you for the most incredible
25 years of my life.

19:49.690 --> 19:54.070
Time for a line change.
Fernando and Kimmy, hit the ice.

19:56.405 --> 19:57.823
Kimberlina.

19:58.032 --> 20:02.661
I thought true love was only true
in love songs and <i>Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>

20:04.496 --> 20:06.248
The book, not the movie.

20:07.792 --> 20:12.254
But when I'm with you,
I know true love can be truly true.

20:13.965 --> 20:15.800
So true.

20:16.759 --> 20:17.760
Kimmy.

20:18.636 --> 20:23.390
Fernando, for the past 15 years
you've made every day an adventure.

20:23.474 --> 20:25.726
I don't always understand
what you're saying...

20:27.352 --> 20:30.189
but I always know that you love me.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.607
And I love you, too.

20:33.776 --> 20:37.488
Fernando, Jesse,
do you take Kimmy and Becky

20:37.571 --> 20:42.409
to be your lawfully wedded wife
and your already-wedded wife?

20:43.202 --> 20:44.703
- I do.
- I do.

20:45.496 --> 20:50.209
Kimmy and Becky, do you take
Fernando and Jesse, uh, to be, uh...

20:50.292 --> 20:51.919
what I just said?

20:53.045 --> 20:54.172
I do.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.506
I...

20:56.423 --> 20:57.466
I...

20:58.258 --> 21:00.594
The next word is "do."

21:02.638 --> 21:03.722
I...

21:03.806 --> 21:05.016
I gotta go.

21:08.144 --> 21:09.728
We've got a runner.

21:10.521 --> 21:11.856
I'll go talk to her.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.611
Mom, what are you doing?

21:17.695 --> 21:19.155
Don't you want to marry Papa?

21:19.822 --> 21:21.240
I think I do.

21:21.907 --> 21:23.659
But then I think I don't.

21:25.077 --> 21:27.079
Man, that cake looks good.

21:29.165 --> 21:32.376
Maybe you need to talk about it.
How are you feeling?

21:32.584 --> 21:33.836
Hungry.

21:33.919 --> 21:37.506
I starved myself for an hour and a half
to fit into this dress.

21:41.927 --> 21:45.181
But then I'm also feeling guilty
about turning your life upside-down.

21:45.973 --> 21:47.641
Oh, screw it!

21:53.731 --> 21:54.732
I mean,

21:54.940 --> 21:57.568
what if things don't work out
with your Papa?

21:57.651 --> 22:00.320
I don't want to put you through
all that heartache.

22:03.282 --> 22:06.535
Do I know how to pick a cake or what?

22:07.578 --> 22:10.206
Here, dig in. You'll feel a lot better.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.669
Mom, I'd love for you and Papa
to be together.

22:15.878 --> 22:18.005
But you need to do what makes you happy.

22:18.214 --> 22:20.549
Cake. Cake makes me happy.

22:21.675 --> 22:25.846
You know what I mean.
I'm in your corner, no matter what.

22:26.055 --> 22:28.599
You're sounding awfully wise and adult.

22:28.807 --> 22:30.809
Somebody in this family has to.

22:32.311 --> 22:33.938
So what are you going to do?

22:34.021 --> 22:37.399
Well, I'm torn
between getting some milk...

22:40.069 --> 22:42.487
or going back out there
and getting married.

22:43.781 --> 22:44.782
You know what?

22:44.990 --> 22:46.366
I'll get married.

22:48.077 --> 22:49.661
And then I'll get milk.

22:51.330 --> 22:55.793
Say, Jess.
Is that hockey stick made of... wood?

22:57.295 --> 22:58.462
Ow!

22:59.255 --> 23:00.756
Here comes the bride.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.551
♪ <i>Must have been an angel... ♪</i>

23:06.678 --> 23:09.932
Dearly beloved... etcetera, etcetera.
Fernando and Jesse, do you?

23:10.141 --> 23:11.183
- I do.
- I do.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.851
Kimmy and Becky, how about you?

23:13.060 --> 23:14.603
- I do.
- I...

23:14.686 --> 23:16.021
I...

23:16.230 --> 23:17.731
I got this one.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.900
- Stephanie, come on.
- On my way.

23:22.278 --> 23:23.821
She'll be right back.

23:23.904 --> 23:26.865
This happens at all our weddings.

23:27.699 --> 23:30.369
Kimmy, what is going on with you?

23:30.452 --> 23:32.246
I'm enjoying my cake.

23:33.205 --> 23:35.749
Here, try some before it's all gone.

23:37.293 --> 23:42.340
Look, you know I have strong
negative feelings about Fernando.

23:44.008 --> 23:48.053
But I will put those aside
and give you my unbiased opinion...

23:48.679 --> 23:50.514
don't marry Fernando.

23:52.641 --> 23:53.642
I say marry the boy.

23:53.725 --> 23:56.436
If it doesn't work out,
then you can just divorce him again.

23:56.520 --> 24:00.607
And then if it doesn't work out then,
you can marry him again.

24:00.691 --> 24:02.484
You're the one making this complicated.

24:04.195 --> 24:06.488
Look, I know these
decisions aren't easy.

24:06.697 --> 24:09.449
I mean, I'm having
trouble making my own.

24:11.535 --> 24:14.163
You two and your man drama...
Enough already!

24:14.372 --> 24:17.875
Pick Matt, pick Steve, marry Fernando,
don't marry Fernando.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.211
In the end, what really matters

24:20.294 --> 24:23.588
is that the three of us are never
going to feel lonely or unloved

24:23.672 --> 24:25.883
because we've always got each other.

24:27.009 --> 24:29.011
Aw, Stephanie.

24:29.094 --> 24:34.433
Yeah, we are strong, independent women.

24:35.726 --> 24:37.395
You're absolutely right.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.604
I don't need a man.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.983
I'm going back out there
to marry Fernando.

24:51.700 --> 24:52.617
♪ <i>Angel... ♪</i>

24:55.246 --> 24:59.166
Sorry, sorry. Just a little cold feet.
They're all warmed up now.

24:59.375 --> 25:03.045
I'm skipping to the "I do's."
I know you two do.

25:03.254 --> 25:05.505
You've been pretty darn consistent.

25:06.465 --> 25:10.386
Kimmy, do you promise to take Fernando
as your husband? Please say, "I do."

25:10.594 --> 25:12.596
I... I...

25:12.804 --> 25:14.056
No, no, no!

25:14.265 --> 25:16.100
No, no, no!

25:18.269 --> 25:20.854
I'm
sorry, I can't do this!

25:24.275 --> 25:25.234
Fernando.

25:27.069 --> 25:28.112
Put me down!

25:30.322 --> 25:31.156
Okay.

25:31.823 --> 25:35.494
But as you can see, we have formed
an impenetrable circle around you.

25:37.829 --> 25:40.958
Fernando, I'm sorry,
but this just doesn't feel right.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.670
I don't want our family
on the racing circuit.

25:47.089 --> 25:48.757
Ramona is really happy here,

25:49.383 --> 25:51.843
and I love living with Stephanie
and D.J. and her boys.

25:53.178 --> 25:56.681
I like my life the way it is
and I'm not ready to change it.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.393
But what about us?

26:00.227 --> 26:02.687
Well, I love you,
and I still want you in my life.

26:02.896 --> 26:07.859
Okay, people, what are we doing?
We are well into overtime.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.906
Kimberly Louise Gibbler,

26:12.990 --> 26:16.410
do you promise
to remain engaged to Fernando

26:16.494 --> 26:18.954
for as long as you feel like it?

26:21.581 --> 26:24.626
- I do!
- We have an "I do!"

26:30.215 --> 26:34.052
And as for that other loving couple...

26:34.261 --> 26:35.762
Where the heck are they?

26:36.805 --> 26:38.494
Jess, shouldn't we
at least say goodbye?

26:38.519 --> 26:39.081
No.

26:39.266 --> 26:42.561
Let's get out of here
before Kimmy sticks me with the bill.

26:43.979 --> 26:45.356
Yeah...

26:45.439 --> 26:46.773
I'm good.

26:52.321 --> 26:55.324
Thanks for coming, Lola.
Sorry it wasn't more romantic.

26:55.533 --> 26:58.618
Are you kidding?
Your family's a freak show.

27:00.454 --> 27:02.747
- You want a hug goodbye?
- No, thanks.

27:06.377 --> 27:07.252
Bye.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.924
Did you see that?

27:14.218 --> 27:16.428
J-Money just got some honey.

27:17.596 --> 27:19.139
And I owe it all to you, Ramona.

27:19.223 --> 27:20.682
I'm so glad you're staying.

27:25.479 --> 27:27.231
I'm glad you're staying, too.

27:27.439 --> 27:28.566
Thanks, Max.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.108
Hey,

27:30.192 --> 27:32.652
does Lola have a little sister?

27:34.488 --> 27:37.782
Max-Money wants some honey, too.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.373
They're out there waiting.

27:45.165 --> 27:47.792
- Are you ready?
- No.

27:48.544 --> 27:49.628
But we're out of cake.

27:51.088 --> 27:52.548
Let's do this.

28:02.433 --> 28:05.060
It's the final rose, Bachelorette.

28:06.853 --> 28:10.023
D.J., is there anything
you'd like to say to the gentlemen?

28:11.567 --> 28:13.277
Matt, Steve,

28:14.069 --> 28:18.240
these last few weeks have been
an emotional roller coaster.

28:20.618 --> 28:22.286
Matt.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.376
When you first walked into the clinic,

28:29.460 --> 28:31.336
I felt an immediate spark.

28:32.879 --> 28:38.843
And when I look into your eyes, I feel
alive and excited about our future.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.679
D.J...

28:42.013 --> 28:44.141
I know what we have is real.

28:47.102 --> 28:49.020
And we're already great partners

28:49.104 --> 28:53.024
so I would just love a chance to see
where this journey will take us.

28:59.698 --> 29:01.241
Steve.

29:05.579 --> 29:10.292
Reconnecting with you,
it's like... we were never apart.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.336
You may know me better than anyone.

29:14.045 --> 29:16.423
And when I look into your eyes, I...

29:16.507 --> 29:20.427
I feel happy, safe, and loved.

29:23.514 --> 29:24.931
Donna-Jo...

29:26.975 --> 29:31.730
I've known it since high school
and I'm even more sure of it now...

29:31.813 --> 29:32.814
we're soul mates.

29:34.065 --> 29:36.568
I couldn't even imagine
my life without you.

29:38.529 --> 29:40.531
That's all I have prepared.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.664
Thank you, gentlemen.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.792
It's now time for D.J.
to hand out the final rose.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.380
Good luck, man.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.964
You, too, bro.

30:02.135 --> 30:04.054
There's no wrong decision...

30:04.137 --> 30:05.889
if you pick Steve.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.975
Just follow your heart...

30:09.059 --> 30:10.435
and pick Matt.

30:13.313 --> 30:16.149
My heart is saying to choose...

30:20.195 --> 30:21.029
me.

30:21.238 --> 30:22.864
Yes!

30:24.866 --> 30:26.159
Wait, what?

30:27.745 --> 30:29.413
I heard the "M". I got excited.

30:31.039 --> 30:34.668
You chose you? Was that even an option?

30:36.086 --> 30:39.256
I'm sorry,
but I just started dating again,

30:39.339 --> 30:41.633
and this got really complicated.

30:41.717 --> 30:45.011
And if it's this hard for me to decide,

30:45.095 --> 30:48.181
then I must not be ready
for a serious relationship.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.225
I'm okay waiting.

30:52.352 --> 30:55.397
In the meantime,
I'll see you every day at work.

30:57.107 --> 30:58.525
I'm still your podiatrist.

31:00.277 --> 31:02.738
Wait, you're not seeing
another one, are you?

31:03.405 --> 31:05.783
No, my feet are all yours.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.118
I'll start with your feet

31:08.201 --> 31:10.746
and I'll work my way up to your heart.

31:13.331 --> 31:15.667
Wow, she picked herself.

31:15.751 --> 31:17.586
I did not see that coming.

31:17.669 --> 31:19.838
I don't know.
I thought she was going to pick you.

31:19.921 --> 31:22.132
I thought she was going to pick you.

31:22.882 --> 31:27.554
- Hey, you want to go get a beer?
- Ah, I could use one. Maybe three.

31:27.763 --> 31:29.389
I could use a pizza.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.141
- Maybe three.
- Mmm.

31:36.938 --> 31:40.484
That was the worst episode
of <i>The Bachelorette</i> I've ever seen.

31:41.526 --> 31:43.403
Well, I'm glad that it's over.

31:44.488 --> 31:46.281
Yeah. And you know what?

31:46.364 --> 31:49.868
Now you're free to date Matt or Steve
or whoever you want.

31:50.786 --> 31:54.122
And best of all,
the She-Wolf Pack is back.
