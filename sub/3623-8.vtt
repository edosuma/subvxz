Without that,
I can't control them!

09:04.068 --> 09:05.434
But Roachie can!

09:05.436 --> 09:07.436
[Chitters]

09:07.438 --> 09:09.005
[Roars]

09:09.007 --> 09:11.174
Ehh, aah!

09:11.176 --> 09:14.544
Aah!

09:18.348 --> 09:19.348
I have to admit,

09:19.350 --> 09:20.983
leading them to the landfill

09:20.985 --> 09:22.151
was pretty inspired.

09:22.153 --> 09:24.287
It was Roachie's idea, really.

09:24.289 --> 09:25.755
Little recycler.

09:25.757 --> 09:27.957
[Chitters]

09:27.959 --> 09:29.057
What's wrong, little guy?

09:29.059 --> 09:31.227
I know it feels like
Roachie's part of the team,

09:31.229 --> 09:33.196
but you want him
to be happy, right?

09:33.198 --> 09:35.131
Well, yeah, but
the lunch lady said

09:35.133 --> 09:37.366
if I brought Roachie back,
I'd get expelled.

09:37.368 --> 09:41.304
Oh. <i>O</i> you mean...

09:41.656 --> 09:42.105
Right.

09:42.106 --> 09:45.274
Roachie, you're the best
dog-sized insect

09:45.276 --> 09:46.709
a guy could ever want.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.711
I know we've bonded.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.214
I feel like an honorary
bug, but it's better

09:51.216 --> 09:52.949
if you're with your friends.

09:52.951 --> 09:54.150
I'll come visit you,

09:54.152 --> 09:55.050
and I'll think of you

09:55.052 --> 09:57.353
every time I step on
something crunchy.

09:57.355 --> 09:58.053
[Sobs] Now go on.

09:58.055 --> 10:01.324
Get out of here,
you multi-legged skip.

10:01.326 --> 10:03.893
It's a buffet
out there for you.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.028
[Chitters and coos]

10:06.030 --> 10:07.263
Ha ha ha! Hey, whoa.

10:07.265 --> 10:09.031
Come on. It tickles.

10:12.169 --> 10:13.135
Aw.

10:13.137 --> 10:14.170
I'm not tearing up

10:14.172 --> 10:15.871
because this is
touching, all right?

10:15.873 --> 10:18.274
The wind's coming off
Miles of garbage.

10:18.276 --> 10:19.308
Good-bye, Roachie.

10:19.310 --> 10:21.978
[Sobs]

10:23.213 --> 10:24.213
Bye-bye.

10:24.215 --> 10:26.415
Bye-bye!

10:26.417 --> 10:29.952
So, Ron, think you can
handle little bugs now?

10:29.954 --> 10:31.921
K.P., thanks to Roachie,

10:31.923 --> 10:33.923
the Ron man
is without bug issues.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.524
What is that?
Is that a garbage spider?!

10:35.526 --> 10:36.759
It's a garbage spider!

10:36.761 --> 10:38.094
Garbage spider!
Get it off!

10:38.096 --> 10:40.129
Get it off!
It's got my nose!

10:40.131 --> 10:42.898
Aah! Ow!
