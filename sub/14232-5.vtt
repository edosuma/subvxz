00:45.612 --> 00:47.713
Of course, very few are
aware of this serious matter

00:47.715 --> 00:50.716
so I'll be traveling afar
to give an all-day lecture

00:50.718 --> 00:53.285
explaining
the proper throne posture.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.287
Slouched shoulders
are an epidemic

00:55.289 --> 00:57.556
among nobility
these days.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.725
Blah, blah, blah,
posture.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.693
Blah, blah, blah,
back problems.

01:01.695 --> 01:05.597
So this is what it's like
to be bored to death.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.734
Star! Are those
dimensional scissors?

01:08.736 --> 01:12.304
Uh... no,
of course not.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.573
Just normal Earth scissors.
See?

01:15.742 --> 01:19.778
Good. Because
you're not to leave Earth.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.614
[giggles nervously]
I would never think of it.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.850
Glad to hear it.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.319
I'm sorry. Your mother
and I must cut you short.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.721
I have lecture
things to do.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.590
Oh, him and his lectures.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.925
Okay, bye.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.765
Star, we're about
to celebrate my parents'
anniversary. Come on.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.634
Oh, no, I didn't
get them anything.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.336
Don't worry about it.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.772
My gift can be
from both of us.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.841
I want to get them something
just from me,

01:48.843 --> 01:51.743
'cause your parents
are actually cool.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.646
Cool?

01:55.815 --> 01:57.816
Cool.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.822
[giggling]

02:03.824 --> 02:04.823
Ahem!

02:04.825 --> 02:07.359
Oh, hello, kids.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.894
Happy anniversary,
you guys.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.896
[both] Ooh!

02:10.898 --> 02:12.764
Wow, Marco.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.400
More fanny packs.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.769
Okay, I know you guys
are non-believers,

02:17.771 --> 02:21.707
but these are way cooler
than last year's.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.775
They have
everything you need,

02:23.777 --> 02:24.943
like a dilemma whistle,

02:24.945 --> 02:26.879
non-drowsy antihistamine,

02:26.881 --> 02:29.715
and a space blanket
made for two.

02:29.717 --> 02:33.752
Oh, yes, you know how much
we love to travel
and see the sights.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.855
Oh, Marco, you put
so much thought into this.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.825
Gifts are such a great way
to show how much you really
care about someone.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.794
I didn't think
it was possible to
love you more

02:42.796 --> 02:43.929
than I do right now.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.932
And I'm giving you
a trip to Mewni.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.868
[both] We're going to Mewni!

02:49.870 --> 02:52.437
And we can use
our new fanny packs.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.673
- We go now, right?
- Right now?

02:54.675 --> 02:55.974
- I want to go right now.
- Can we go right now?

02:55.976 --> 02:58.010
Welcome to Mewni!

03:00.747 --> 03:02.881
Is this where
you grew up?

03:02.883 --> 03:05.918
No. I live there.

03:07.820 --> 03:08.987
[all] Ooh!

03:08.989 --> 03:10.856
Higher.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.459
[all] Oooh!!

03:14.461 --> 03:16.695
Higher.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.432
[all]  <i>Oooh!!</i>

03:20.434 --> 03:22.434
Let's go there.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.938
You don't wanna see
that lame, cheesy,
touristy stuff.

03:25.940 --> 03:29.975
What you want
is the real Mewni experience.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.045
[babies crying,
sheep bleating]

03:36.783 --> 03:40.052
[screaming,
giggling]

03:41.754 --> 03:42.955
Oh, hello, little boy.

03:42.957 --> 03:47.726
[chewing,
screaming]

03:47.728 --> 03:49.494
[nervous laughter]
Yum-yum.

03:49.496 --> 03:52.030
Um... oh, look,
an open-air market.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.733
Get your hydra
trail apples.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.001
Half off shrunken
goblin heads.

03:56.003 --> 03:59.037
Want pickled
giant's toe? Is good.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.875
I got what you need.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.812
I'll take
the wind chimes, please.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.016
[gasps]

04:11.018 --> 04:13.852
- Dad!
- Mmm?

04:17.824 --> 04:18.991
Star, what the...

04:18.993 --> 04:20.959
- My dad's here.
- Your dad?

04:20.961 --> 04:23.762
Yes. I don't know
what he's doing here,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.831
but if he sees me,
I am dead.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.766
Breathe.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.002
Just tell my parents
the fanny packs are
from both of us,

04:30.004 --> 04:31.870
and we can go home.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.505
But they're actually
enjoying my gift.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.940
I don't wanna
ruin this for them.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.945
Okay, uh, next,
I wanna show you...

04:39.947 --> 04:43.115
oh, Mewni's
natural beauty.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.519
Sounds thrilling.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.087
We love nature.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.790
"Forest of Certain Death"?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.825
Oh, don't read too much
into the name.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.927
Hurry up.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.997
So it's really
kind of important
to keep moving.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.099
There's a bleeding
willow tree.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.869
- [both] Ooh.
- Whoa!

05:03.871 --> 05:06.538
Here's a carnivore
blossom.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.073
Are you guys
seein' any of this?

05:08.075 --> 05:11.076
See it? Can't take
our eyes off it.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.079
[both] Best anniversary ever,
best anniversary ever!

05:14.081 --> 05:17.549
Best anniversary ever,
best anniversary ever!

05:17.551 --> 05:19.117
Wait. Come back!

05:19.119 --> 05:22.154
Oh, yeah.
Nice try.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.127
Hey, guys, did you see
what I just did

05:29.129 --> 05:30.562
with that bubble gum?

05:30.564 --> 05:32.964
[Star] Wait.
Come back!

05:32.966 --> 05:34.966
Of course not.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.902
Oh, wow.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.904
These flowers
are lovely.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.840
Not as lovely
as you, dear.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.108
Wait for me!

05:48.915 --> 05:50.982
[blows whistle]

05:51.984 --> 05:53.618
Hmm, it worked.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.053
Come on, my dear.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.922
Let me capture
your beauty-ness

05:56.924 --> 05:59.591
on this magnificent
adventure.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.993
[giggles]

06:01.995 --> 06:03.195
Wait. Come back.

06:03.197 --> 06:07.899
Okay, you can stop being
so cool now.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.069
Okay, now,
hold still.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.939
[screeching]

06:13.941 --> 06:15.974
Ah, they're still alive.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.877
- These tracks
are fresh.
- [gasps]

06:21.948 --> 06:24.649
Pegasus feathers,
he's on to me.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.618
Nothin' makes you feel
more like a man

06:26.620 --> 06:29.654
than goin' to the bathroom
in the woods.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.123
We gotta go.
It's not safe here.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.959
- Look. My dad is
right there.
- This way.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.927
Let's just get
your parents
and go home.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.630
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Diaz,
that concludes the tour.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.165
Hope you've
enjoyed your...

06:40.167 --> 06:43.001
Mr. and Mrs. Diaz?

06:43.003 --> 06:44.169
Where did they go?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.171
Look. Footprints.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.918
Look. It's
their stuff.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.990
But where are they?

07:13.199 --> 07:15.100
[gasps]

07:19.138 --> 07:21.006
[roaring]

07:21.008 --> 07:22.207
[screaming]

07:22.209 --> 07:24.042
Let's get outta here.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.278
No, that thing
ate your parents.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.014
Look out.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.219
Let her go!

07:35.154 --> 07:37.956
Super Rainbow Blast!

07:39.959 --> 07:41.293
There.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.967
A dead end!

07:58.044 --> 08:00.078
Quick. Under here.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.749
Wow! What else
do you have in there?

08:04.751 --> 08:06.184
I pretty much used up
everything

08:06.186 --> 08:09.020
when I was schoolin'
the forest of certain death.

08:09.022 --> 08:13.091
Well, everything except
for this miniature  <i>miniature</i>
<i>book of knots.</i>

08:13.093 --> 08:15.026
So cute.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.128
Did you say knots?

08:17.130 --> 08:19.097
Yeah. Why?

08:19.099 --> 08:22.000
- Bet you can't catch me.
- Over here!

08:24.036 --> 08:26.071
Hey, you.
Yeah, you.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.242
You can't catch me.

08:30.244 --> 08:31.376
Over here.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.113
Come and get me.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.126
Whoo-hoo!

08:48.128 --> 08:52.230
[trumpeting yell]

08:56.168 --> 08:57.335
Star!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.204
My parents are still
inside that thing.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.042
[all cheering]

09:04.044 --> 09:06.111
We're free!

09:06.113 --> 09:07.345
They're not here?

09:07.347 --> 09:09.147
Quick, to the large
intestine,

09:09.149 --> 09:11.316
before they're
fully digested.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.419
[squishing sounds,
Marco gagging]

09:16.122 --> 09:19.424
[giggling]

09:22.828 --> 09:25.063
There's nothing like
a steamy bath

09:25.065 --> 09:27.132
after a long day
of exploration.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.334
- Mom, Dad.
- You're alive!

09:29.336 --> 09:32.804
And you're only wearing
the fanny packs.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.239
Ah, King Butterfly.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.274
Care for a dip?

09:37.276 --> 09:39.110
[clears throat]

09:39.112 --> 09:41.112
As inviting as
that sounds,

09:41.114 --> 09:42.380
I need a minute
with my daughter.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.182
Ow, ow, ow.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.818
Star, you know you're
not to leave Earth.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.186
What are you doing here?

09:48.188 --> 09:49.387
Okay, okay,
but the thing is,

09:49.389 --> 09:51.856
it's not exactly
my fault.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.325
It was an anniversary.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.327
It all started
with the fanny packs.

09:55.329 --> 09:59.364
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
giving some boring lecture?

09:59.366 --> 10:01.266
Uh, yes.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.168
Got a little lost.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.402
The directions were...

10:04.404 --> 10:06.404
It all started with
fanny packs.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.840
[sighs]

10:08.842 --> 10:10.875
There is no lecture.

10:10.877 --> 10:14.179
Being king is exhausting.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.181
Every once in a while,
I need to sneak away

10:16.183 --> 10:18.283
and fight monsters.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.884
It keeps me sane.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.187
And it's good for
my throne posture.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.889
So I get my monster fighting
from you.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.892
Cool.
Cool!

10:27.894 --> 10:30.228
I suppose so.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.197
[both laughing]

10:32.199 --> 10:34.199
Are you gonna
tell Mom you saw me?

10:34.201 --> 10:36.167
I didn't see you...

10:36.169 --> 10:37.369
and you didn't see me.

10:37.371 --> 10:40.171
But just this once.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.906
[both] Hugs!

10:41.908 --> 10:43.408
Farewell.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.246
It's cool that
you guys bonded,

10:48.248 --> 10:50.215
and you got to see
that side of your dad.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.183
[whistling]

10:52.185 --> 10:54.753
I wish I hadn't seen
that side of my dad.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.425
- There she is!
- Hey, Star.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.327
- Hi, Star Butterfly.
- What's goin' on, girl?

11:02.329 --> 11:05.230
Star, will you be
my science partner?

11:05.232 --> 11:07.165
- [explosion]
- You bet.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.901
- Star, I baked you a pie.
- All right!

11:09.903 --> 11:12.904
Star, I ate
the pie.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.240
I knew you would.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.442
Star, I wallpapered
my locker with pictures of you.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.210
That's weird,

11:19.212 --> 11:21.246
'cause I wallpapered
my locker

11:21.248 --> 11:23.214
with pictures of you!

11:23.216 --> 11:24.282
[both] Yeah!

11:24.284 --> 11:25.917
Star, Star.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.186
Please zap me.
Please, please, please.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.387
Oh, yeah.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.222
<i>Gracias, </i> Star.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.258
No wonder everyone's

And all she wanted

at the next bus stop?
