15:40.026 --> 15:43.681
define "execute the mission,"

15:43.725 --> 15:45.814
because there's no way
she's killing this fucking guy

15:45.857 --> 15:47.468
with all that security.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.122
And he's not even here yet.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.950
- Mark the target
with a tracker,

15:50.993 --> 15:52.038
draw the target
out where we can get

15:52.081 --> 15:53.909
visual confirmation
through satellite.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.085
At that point, we can
strike with the QRF.

15:56.129 --> 15:59.088
We can strike with the Roosevelt
if we end up tracking him back

15:59.132 --> 16:01.264
to a location that's better
suited for that response.

16:01.308 --> 16:05.268
And if the opportunity
presents itself,

16:05.312 --> 16:06.922
she can neutralize
the target herself.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.750
Any of these
are possibilities.

16:11.057 --> 16:14.103
[music]

16:44.655 --> 16:47.006
- Ehsan, how are you?

16:47.049 --> 16:49.008
- Very good, thank you.
Come in.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.146
Sit.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.192
You went to
New York with Aaliyah?

16:59.235 --> 17:01.542
- Yeah, we went shopping
for the wedding.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.023
- And then at night,
you leave in tears.

17:07.069 --> 17:10.203
Then come back,
then leave in tears again.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.074
Then Aaliyah
leaves in the morning.

17:12.117 --> 17:13.858
And more tears.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.122
You don't know her
to cry for her.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.037
She doesn't know you.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.083
So, why the tears?

17:23.303 --> 17:24.694
- Because she's scared.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.089
She loves you but she's scared.

17:29.222 --> 17:32.355
I'm scared too
for different reasons.

17:32.399 --> 17:35.793
She's scared because her life
is about to change,

17:35.837 --> 17:38.622
and I'm scared mine
won't change.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.887
- [chuckles]
Women.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.020
They even tell the same lies.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.240
How they know
to tell the same lies,

17:47.283 --> 17:50.286
it's a fucking mystery.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.551
Don't like that, do you?

17:55.900 --> 17:58.207
[laughs]

17:58.251 --> 17:59.991
The fire with this one.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.256
Tomorrow, Aaliyah is my wife.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.388
And tomorrow,
there is no more you.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.390
Tonight is goodbye.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.739
And if you tell her
that we spoke

18:08.783 --> 18:09.784
I will throw you
in the fucking sea.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.264
- I'd like to see you try.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.180
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.878
- I suggest you bring
"tons of fun" if you do,

18:16.921 --> 18:19.185
because I could wipe
the floor with your boney ass.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.760
Take me to Aaliyah or
take me to the fucking airport.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.414
- I think airport's best.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.242
[speaking Arabic]

18:36.289 --> 18:37.551
- Let's go.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.126
- I bet she spends it
with her legs closed anyway.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.826
- Where do you learn
to speak like that to men?

18:51.869 --> 18:54.394
Who fucking raised you?

18:54.437 --> 18:56.222
Who the fuck raised
you to speak like that?

19:06.362 --> 19:08.016
[knocks]

19:08.059 --> 19:10.149
[door squeaks]
- Through there.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.286
- Now what.
Where do I go?

19:17.330 --> 19:19.897
- Don't know. This is the
woman's side. I can't go in.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.295
[music]

19:26.339 --> 19:28.384
[indistinct chattering]

19:55.106 --> 19:56.891
[indistinct chattering]

20:10.383 --> 20:13.429
- Ah, I was worried you'd
miss your flight!

20:13.473 --> 20:14.822
- Oh, yeah. Uh...

20:15.388 --> 20:17.259
[kisses]

20:17.303 --> 20:19.914
They--I did and then
I got another one.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.438
Airports, I don't
understand them.

20:22.482 --> 20:23.483
- They are not
for understanding.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.485
They are for avoiding.

20:25.528 --> 20:28.401
We need to find you
a rich husband with a plane.

20:28.444 --> 20:29.793
And this is the place.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.666
Ugh.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.365
You are my excuse to escape.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.019
But first, come meet my mother.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.893
[indistinct chattering]

20:49.465 --> 20:51.162
[speaking Arabic]

20:56.342 --> 20:57.908
- I'm going to show her around.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.432
She's never been to Mallorca.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.439
- [sighs] You can see
where I get my charm.

21:06.482 --> 21:07.962
Come.

21:11.357 --> 21:15.143
[music]

21:15.186 --> 21:20.279
[ringing]

21:23.499 --> 21:25.849
[sirens approaching]

21:28.504 --> 21:30.114
[screams]

21:31.464 --> 21:35.294
[screaming, crying]

21:37.861 --> 21:40.037
[screaming continues]

21:40.081 --> 21:41.387
- Kate!

21:45.391 --> 21:48.394
[Kate] No!
- Kate.

21:48.437 --> 21:51.875
It's okay. Go back, in.
Thank you. Thank you.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.531
- Kate, Kate.
- [whimpering]

21:55.575 --> 21:57.490
You okay?
You okay?

21:57.533 --> 21:58.882
You all right?

21:58.926 --> 22:00.014
You're dreaming.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.537
Honey, you're just dreaming.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.147
It's a bad dream.
It's okay.

22:04.235 --> 22:08.805
[music]

22:08.849 --> 22:13.201
- When this goes down, I sure
hope it goes down at night.

22:13.244 --> 22:16.073
- If it goes down at all,
it'll happen at noon.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.814
That's our luck.

22:17.858 --> 22:18.946
[phone rings]

22:28.956 --> 22:30.305
- Hey.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.220
[Kate] Mama?

22:32.263 --> 22:36.442
- Yeah, baby.
Are you okay?

22:36.485 --> 22:38.313
What time is it over there?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.533
- I missed her funeral.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.448
- Her funeral?

22:42.491 --> 22:45.233
- Holly.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.365
Holly's funeral. I missed it.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.500
- Kate, you were
in the hospital.

22:51.544 --> 22:52.936
Everybody understands that.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.982
- I don't care
about everyone else.

22:56.287 --> 22:59.073
I didn't even
get to say goodbye.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.597
- I can, um...

23:03.556 --> 23:05.645
I can take you...
I can take you to see her

23:05.688 --> 23:07.560
when I get back, okay?

23:07.603 --> 23:10.563
You can say goodbye then.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.652
- No, it's too late.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.871
- You say goodbye in your heart.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.134
It doesn't matter
where you are.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.049
Okay, you can say--
you can say goodbye now.

23:19.093 --> 23:22.618
You can close your eyes
and say goodbye.

23:25.316 --> 23:26.448
- Okay.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.495
- Okay.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.411
Where's your father?

23:32.454 --> 23:33.890
- He's right here.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.374
- Hey.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.333
- What the fuck was that, Neal?

23:42.377 --> 23:45.424
How 'bout a little heads-up
before the fucking ambush?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.991
- I'm sorry, you got the same
heads-up that I got when

23:48.035 --> 23:49.993
I wake up to her screaming
like somebody stabbed her.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.517
She said she wanted
to talk to you,

23:51.560 --> 23:53.606
I didn't know what she was
going to say

23:53.649 --> 23:55.042
and I didn't think she needed
fucking permission to say it.

23:55.085 --> 23:57.044
- I know, but I'm not
in the right place to be

23:57.087 --> 23:58.306
dealing with this, Neal.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.744
You know what?
How about we start over, okay?

24:01.788 --> 24:03.137
- No, let's not.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.225
Just focus on
what you're doing.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.531
We won't bother you again.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.663
Everything is fine
here minus the night terrors

24:07.707 --> 24:10.057
three hours of rehab
and a 14 year-old

24:10.100 --> 24:11.362
who is barely--fuck!

24:12.668 --> 24:16.542
[music]

24:16.585 --> 24:17.586
- [sniffs]

24:19.283 --> 24:21.372
- [panting]

24:24.550 --> 24:26.595
I'm sorry.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.249
Joe, I'm sorry, okay?

24:28.292 --> 24:31.513
This is, uh... This is not
how I expected to wake up.

24:31.557 --> 24:35.430
I'm sure I'm catching you
at the absolute worst time.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.562
You just focus
on what you're doing,

24:36.605 --> 24:37.650
okay, don't worry about us.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.434
Everything's fine.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.002
- Okay.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.221
- Great, bye.

24:48.661 --> 24:49.966
[Bobby] Hey, boss.
[knocking]

24:50.010 --> 24:51.751
- Yeah?
- Island's in sight.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.449
- Okay. Just give me a minute.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.194
[sighs]

25:05.112 --> 25:06.374
[deep breath]

25:18.038 --> 25:19.779
[music]

25:32.835 --> 25:34.358
- House is on that point.

25:34.402 --> 25:35.664
- Come around the east.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.231
Let's get eyes
on the shoreline.

25:54.814 --> 25:58.731
- Ah, there. We have eyes on him
and he has eyes on us.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.820
- Can't see through the
reflection of the glass.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.998
[music]

26:10.699 --> 26:13.963
- Stairway down to the beach is
her only way down on this side.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.399
[Joe] Those are some
steep cliffs.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.010
[Tucker]
How close do you want me?

26:17.053 --> 26:18.228
- Well, you can't insert here.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.361
Just keep heading
south and east.

26:20.404 --> 26:23.277
Looks like it's
wet suits and flippers.

26:23.320 --> 26:27.063
- God, I hate fucking
fighting in a wet suit.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.282
- That water is in the low
sixties.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.066
- How close can you get us?

26:30.110 --> 26:32.765
- Let me see what
the back side looks like.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.244
If I can make it
a short swim, I'll do it.

26:35.724 --> 26:38.597
[music]

26:52.915 --> 26:54.917
[Cruz] So, uh,
what happens this evening?

26:54.961 --> 26:57.354
- This is the calm
before the storm.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.835
Tomorrow people
arrive during the day.

26:59.879 --> 27:02.272
Ehsan and I say vows,
but that is private,

27:02.316 --> 27:04.753
just immediate family.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.059
Then after that,
the men go one way,

27:06.102 --> 27:08.148
and the women go the other.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.324
They have their celebration
and party all night

27:10.367 --> 27:12.935
and we have our celebration
and dance all night.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.720
- Two different parties?

27:14.763 --> 27:17.897
- It's practice
for the rest of my life.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.768
And the parties
don't start 'til late,

27:19.812 --> 27:22.815
ten at night, but I can't
show up until midnight,

27:22.858 --> 27:24.817
or I'll look too eager.
- Mm.

27:26.819 --> 27:30.953
- Then I walk a long plank
to a couch looking out

27:30.997 --> 27:34.261
so that everyone can admire me,

27:34.304 --> 27:38.134
but what they do is gossip,
argue about my dress.

27:40.006 --> 27:43.096
- Then Ehsan and a few men,
his father and brothers

27:43.139 --> 27:46.795
and my father and brothers,
will visit us for a few songs.

27:46.839 --> 27:49.885
Ehsan and I will
dance then the men go back

27:49.929 --> 27:52.932
to their party
and we continue ours.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.281
- Your father's coming
to the wedding?

27:54.324 --> 27:57.893
- I know.
No, he's here.

27:57.937 --> 28:01.810
He's with the men, but you
will meet him at breakfast.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.945
He's very serious.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.250
You met my mother?

28:07.294 --> 28:08.904
She's the loud one.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.080
- I thought you said
they'd kill him if he came.

28:11.124 --> 28:13.256
- That's what mama tells me.

28:13.300 --> 28:16.172
But everywhere
is a danger for him.

28:16.216 --> 28:19.306
It always has.
My whole life.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.527
- Why?

28:23.571 --> 28:26.835
- I don't know the oil business.

28:26.879 --> 28:29.359
- Yeah, I don't know either,
but I know there's plenty

28:29.403 --> 28:31.405
of people who do it and
don't get killed for it.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.886
- You think the president
of Chevron or Exxon

28:33.929 --> 28:36.410
don't have armed guards
and bullet-proof cars?

28:36.453 --> 28:38.194
And that's in America.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.502
[scoffs]

28:41.545 --> 28:43.896
They say he is a terrorist.

28:43.939 --> 28:44.984
Funds armies.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.855
Does all these things.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.992
He sells oil.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.124
To whoever will buy it.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.387
He doesn't play the game:
"“Sanction this country.

28:57.431 --> 29:02.001
Don't buy it from that one.
Don't sell to this one."

29:02.044 --> 29:03.829
And who cares?

29:03.872 --> 29:06.919
It will happen some day.
They'll get him.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.271
I think that's
why he chose Ehsan.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.187
Very smart investor.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.231
Very respected.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.410
And maybe our children, they
don't have to play with oil.

29:21.411 --> 29:23.544
They just play with money.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.202
[Aaliyah sighs]

29:31.639 --> 29:33.119
Ehsan knows about us.

29:34.903 --> 29:37.776
He doesn't know, but...
he knows.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.521
I bet that's the last of
New York I've seen for a while.

29:48.656 --> 29:51.833
- In two days all I will know
of love is what I can imagine.

29:55.054 --> 29:56.185
And what I can remember.

30:00.189 --> 30:03.062
It's not fair to you
to say, but it's true.

30:05.064 --> 30:09.111
And maybe you'll
remember me some day.

30:09.155 --> 30:12.898
[music]

30:12.941 --> 30:14.551
- You're gonna be pretty
hard to forget.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.429
- [sniffs] They say you only
think you know love

30:22.472 --> 30:24.387
until you have a child.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.563
Something must happen,
something biological

30:26.607 --> 30:29.044
because I can't stand children.
- [laughs]

30:29.088 --> 30:31.830
- They're too noisy and
dirty and... Yeah, not a fan.

30:35.398 --> 30:37.009
Well, I hope I love my children.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.186
I hope God gives me that.

30:42.449 --> 30:43.842
Maybe it will be enough.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.980
Come on.
I'll show you to your room.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.948
[music]

31:06.734 --> 31:08.649
[Randy]
That's not too bad, Tuck.

31:08.692 --> 31:11.739
Ease up that ridge,
then head up front.

31:11.782 --> 31:12.958
How close can you get us?

31:13.001 --> 31:14.960
- The draft on this thing
is only six feet,

31:15.003 --> 31:16.657
so I can get you pretty close.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.093
Fifty, maybe forty
feet off shore.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.660
- I'll take it.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.575
- Yeah, well, I still want fins
if we're wearing plates.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.055
- Shit, I ain't wearing plates.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.752
Fuck that,
I ain't wearing a vest.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.536
We need to move fast-fast-fast.

31:26.580 --> 31:27.973
- Think about that.

31:28.016 --> 31:30.062
- Well, we ain't all
fucking aqua-woman, can we, Joe?

31:30.105 --> 31:32.020
- Shut up, Two cups.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.717
I'm not wearing plates
either but wear your vest.

31:33.761 --> 31:34.980
Some security guard makes
a lucky shot with his pistol

31:35.023 --> 31:36.982
and you got a problem
that we have to carry.

31:37.983 --> 31:38.984
[Kaitlyn] Joe.

31:49.211 --> 31:49.951
He's here.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.696
Am I seeing things?

31:55.739 --> 31:57.524
- You're not seeing things.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.181
- That him?

32:02.224 --> 32:03.834
- That's him.

32:03.878 --> 32:06.663
- We must shut this down.
How do we shut this down?

32:06.707 --> 32:07.969
- I need traveler.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.101
You have a
defcon recommendation?

32:09.144 --> 32:10.972
- You can't get
her out of there?

32:11.016 --> 32:14.802
- Not without a gun fight
and I mean a big one.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.673
- I recommend defcon three.

32:16.717 --> 32:19.111
[Mason] Mister President,
we have a situation

32:19.154 --> 32:20.068
unfolding in real time.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.207
[music]

32:32.080 --> 32:33.603
- I have the three witches
in a hotel.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.084
My mother is downstairs.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.173
And I'm across the hall.

32:42.873 --> 32:45.006
Kitchen is down that hall
and down the stairs

32:45.050 --> 32:46.486
if you get hungry.

32:46.529 --> 32:47.574
- Thanks.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.538
- Your luggage is inside.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.936
- When's breakfast?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.633
- Late.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.157
Everything tomorrow is late.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.296
- You're not leaving.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.863
- Because you haven't
gone inside.

33:15.906 --> 33:16.995
- Because you're not leaving.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.094
- I'll see you in the morning.

33:29.137 --> 33:30.530
- Yeah.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.707
[music]

33:53.640 --> 33:55.207
[crying]

34:05.086 --> 34:07.262
[music]

34:19.405 --> 34:21.320
[beeping]

34:37.161 --> 34:39.251
[phone rings]

34:39.293 --> 34:41.253
- Yeah?

34:41.295 --> 34:42.645
- They're asking again
if there's a way to pull her.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.299
- She is in a house
with thirty guests

34:44.342 --> 34:46.214
and about twenty-five
security personnel

34:46.257 --> 34:48.172
patrolling the ground
and around the perimeter.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.652
Assume they have what we have:

34:49.696 --> 34:51.784
NV, thermal, overwatch,
all of it.

34:51.828 --> 34:54.135
How the fuck am I supposed
to get her out?

34:54.179 --> 34:55.614
- Just relaying the question.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.225
- Yeah, well, the answer
hasn't changed.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.228
[exhales]

35:05.320 --> 35:06.278
[door closes]

35:08.715 --> 35:09.759
- No.

35:27.255 --> 35:28.648
[phone vibrates]

35:49.495 --> 35:50.800
[phone vibrates]

36:11.299 --> 36:12.300
[clears throat]

36:22.963 --> 36:24.138
[deep breath]

36:24.182 --> 36:25.313
- Give it to me.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.317
Give it to me.

36:29.361 --> 36:32.755
You will never get back to them
if you keep thinking about them.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.803
You know better than that.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.290
[deep breath]

36:52.035 --> 36:53.385
[sighs]

36:59.391 --> 37:02.132
[deep breath]

37:06.441 --> 37:08.269
- Ain't this job
the fucking best?

37:08.313 --> 37:10.053
[laughing]

37:11.054 --> 37:12.404
[Tex] Yee-haw.

37:14.319 --> 37:17.409
[music]

37:29.203 --> 37:30.378
[door opens]

37:33.512 --> 37:35.557
- I don't want to do anything.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.124
It's too confusing.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.343
- I don't want to get married.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.348
- Tell him.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.480
- I did. Doesn't matter.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.874
I don't have a say.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.832
No one cares what I want.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.533
- What do you want?

37:54.576 --> 37:56.535
- [crying]
Not this.

38:12.464 --> 38:15.423
[kiss] I'll never
have this again.

38:15.467 --> 38:16.946
This is the last time.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.389
- I... I can't.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.960
- I just want to feel
loved one last time.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.226
- You don't want that from me.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.924
You don't know me.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.447
- I know you.

38:40.579 --> 38:42.320
- You don't.

38:43.625 --> 38:48.108
[music]

38:48.151 --> 38:49.544
- You're kind.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.330
- I'm not.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.594
- You're honest.

38:55.637 --> 38:56.943
[chuckles]

38:56.986 --> 38:58.988
- I am the furthest
thing from honest.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.950
- Oh, yeah?
Then what are you?

39:09.303 --> 39:10.348
- Not what you think.

39:13.481 --> 39:14.961
- Are you my friend?

39:17.093 --> 39:18.356
- Don't ask me that.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.272
- Are you?

39:22.316 --> 39:23.926
- I don't know
what the fuck I am.

39:29.976 --> 39:33.545
- But you know you want this.
You know that.

39:34.589 --> 39:36.330
Tell me that you don't.

39:50.605 --> 39:52.564
[panting]

39:56.089 --> 39:59.005
- I can't fucking do this.

39:59.048 --> 40:01.355
[panting]

40:01.399 --> 40:02.487
- But you want to.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.532
- Yeah, that's
the fucking problem.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.534
- It's not a problem.

40:06.578 --> 40:09.450
- I need a drink.
I'm gonna get some water.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.452
Do you want some water?

40:11.496 --> 40:13.715
- I want vodka.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.195
- That's the last thing
either of us need.

40:34.214 --> 40:36.259
[music]

40:53.233 --> 40:54.626
[footsteps running]

41:26.005 --> 41:28.050
[breathes deeply]

41:30.270 --> 41:32.707
- Get it together.
Take your heart out of it.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.016
[whispering]
Focus on the mission.

41:37.059 --> 41:39.148
Focus, focus, focus.
Focus on the mission.

41:40.193 --> 41:42.108
[breathes deeply]

41:44.371 --> 41:47.722
[Man] I have seen many things.

41:47.766 --> 41:50.377
But I've never seen
a woman talk to a freezer.

41:57.906 --> 42:00.343
It seems we both got caught
with our pants down.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.173
- Yeah.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.871
- Please don't
be uncomfortable,

42:05.914 --> 42:11.267
I have many daughters and
have seen many wearing less.

42:11.311 --> 42:13.095
You on the other hand,

42:13.139 --> 42:15.315
are thirty years late to being
impressed by me in my shorts.

42:17.752 --> 42:19.232
What are you
looking for, my dear?

42:19.754 --> 42:21.974
- Water.

42:22.017 --> 42:24.324
- Water is on this side.

42:33.638 --> 42:34.813
- Could I have another one?

42:34.856 --> 42:36.684
One for your daughter.

42:38.904 --> 42:40.775
- You're Aaliyah's friend
from the States.

42:42.777 --> 42:43.952
The student.

42:48.391 --> 42:51.830
Well, you seem smart enough
to know that water

42:51.873 --> 42:53.353
is not in the freezer.

42:54.876 --> 42:58.488
[music]

42:58.532 --> 43:00.142
Sure you weren't
looking for this?

43:08.150 --> 43:09.891
- I wasn't.

43:09.935 --> 43:11.110
- I sure am.

43:12.938 --> 43:16.245
- There is a place in Barcelona
called Gelaaati Del Marco.

43:16.289 --> 43:19.901
The best Gelato outside Italy.

43:19.945 --> 43:22.034
Maybe even better than Italy.

43:22.077 --> 43:25.080
Maybe best in the world.

43:26.865 --> 43:28.127
You be the judge.

43:41.227 --> 43:42.750
Well?

43:42.794 --> 43:46.362
- Wow, that's, uh...

43:46.406 --> 43:48.103
That's pretty damn good.

43:48.147 --> 43:50.845
- Best in the world.
I told you.

43:50.889 --> 43:51.933
- Marine!

43:51.977 --> 43:54.457
You are a United States
fucking marine!

43:54.501 --> 43:56.285

44:21.310 --> 44:23.138
[music]

44:26.141 --> 44:27.577
- Moving southeast.

44:27.621 --> 44:28.970
- Come on!
Get us in.

44:31.233 --> 44:34.062
[music]

46:11.507 --> 46:13.379
-[Kaitlyn] Yeah?
- What do you know?

46:13.422 --> 46:14.641
- Same thing you do.

46:14.684 --> 46:15.990
She initiated
the beacon and now

46:16.034 --> 46:17.557
half the compound
is chasing her.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.211
- Is she compromised
or did she make contact?

46:19.254 --> 46:20.908
- Unclear.
But that's a lot of blood.

46:20.952 --> 46:22.954
- Is it hers?
- Don't know.

46:22.997 --> 46:24.825
- No bullshit, Kaitlyn,
are we Geronimo?

46:24.869 --> 46:26.435
- I don't know.
Looks like it.

46:26.479 --> 46:28.611
- What is she saying?
- She knows what we know.

46:28.655 --> 46:30.048
Stay on the line.

46:30.091 --> 46:31.005
- Not going anywhere.

46:31.049 --> 46:32.920
- I need a
no bullshit assessment

46:32.964 --> 46:34.139
of what the fuck is going on.

46:34.182 --> 46:36.010

47:16.137 --> 47:16.834
[groans]

47:27.018 --> 47:29.107
[Joe] I've got her.
Get up!

47:35.113 --> 47:36.244
- They're on the run,
what are we doing?

47:36.288 --> 47:37.332
- Clean the scene.

47:42.685 --> 47:44.774
[gunfire stops]

47:44.818 --> 47:46.733
- Moving.
- Move.

47:52.521 --> 47:53.740
[panting]

47:56.699 --> 47:59.398
[Joe] You're fine!
- [grunting]

47:59.441 --> 48:01.879
[Joe] Let's go!
Swim to it!

[Cruz gasping]

48:34.302 --> 48:35.434
[grunts]

48:36.478 --> 48:39.220
- Easy. Easy.

48:39.264 --> 48:42.006
Not here.
Inside.

48:42.049 --> 48:44.051
We ain't out of this shit yet.

48:44.095 --> 48:45.705
I'm taking the bridge!

48:45.748 --> 48:47.098
- Did you hit the target?

48:47.141 --> 48:49.709
Did you hit the target?

48:50.797 --> 48:52.146
Marine, look at me!

48:52.190 --> 48:54.018
Did you hit the target?

48:54.061 --> 48:55.541
- I hit the target.

48:55.584 --> 48:57.238
- The ace of spades is dead.

48:57.282 --> 48:58.326
- The ace of spades
is dead.

48:58.370 --> 48:59.762
[panting]

49:02.852 --> 49:05.681
- We have joy.
[panting]

49:05.725 --> 49:09.772
I repeat: we have joy.

49:12.166 --> 49:14.603
[muffled voices]

49:14.647 --> 49:15.735
- Geronimo.

49:18.607 --> 49:20.261
- We gotta start the contain.

49:22.220 --> 49:24.135
- Congratulations,
Deputy Director.

49:24.178 --> 49:27.660
You have set Mideast
relations back forty years.

49:27.703 --> 49:30.184
- Forty years ago, gas was
ninety cents a gallon.

49:30.228 --> 49:32.273
Maybe it's not such
a bad thing.

49:32.317 --> 49:34.188
- It wouldn't be such a bad
thing if we weren't trying

49:34.232 --> 49:38.018
to wean the nation
off fucking fossil fuels.

49:38.062 --> 49:39.585
You fucked us.

49:39.628 --> 49:41.587
- I don't choose the list.

49:41.630 --> 49:43.893
If you wanted him alive you
should have taken him off of it.

49:43.937 --> 49:47.245
Don't give me shit because
we did our fucking job.

49:49.073 --> 49:52.728
[music]

50:08.962 --> 50:10.311
- Roosevelt,
this is Raven.

50:10.355 --> 50:12.270
We are inbound.
The extraction was hot.

50:12.313 --> 50:13.923
[man] Roger that, Raven.
We have eyes on.

50:13.967 --> 50:15.490
We're on the move so adjust
to these coordinates

50:15.534 --> 50:17.275
as rally point,
we have your six by air.

50:21.279 --> 50:23.281
- Whoo.

50:25.413 --> 50:26.675
- Outside.

50:35.162 --> 50:36.859
[grunts]

50:40.124 --> 50:42.822
- You ever lay a fucking
hand on me again

50:42.865 --> 50:44.780
and we're gonna figure this out
until the sun comes up.

50:44.824 --> 50:46.391
Are we clear?

50:46.434 --> 50:49.220
- Look what you did to me?
- What? What did I do?

50:49.263 --> 50:51.265
- Look what you made of me.
- What?

50:51.309 --> 50:55.443
- He was an old man and I killed
him in his fucking underwear.

50:55.487 --> 50:58.838
- What you did was eliminate one
of the worst fucking

50:58.881 --> 51:00.927
perpetrators of violence
in the past twenty years.

51:00.970 --> 51:02.885
What you did saved lives.

51:02.929 --> 51:06.367
- Says you.
- Says fucking history!

51:06.411 --> 51:08.326
And you just changed it.

51:08.369 --> 51:11.546
[Joe panting]

51:11.590 --> 51:13.635
- All I changed was oil prices.

51:17.422 --> 51:19.206
I'm not like you.

51:19.250 --> 51:21.426
I'm not a fucking liar.

51:21.469 --> 51:26.300
My heart isn't a weapon
and my body isn't a tool.

51:26.344 --> 51:28.824
I don't sleep at night
because of you.

51:28.868 --> 51:30.739
I don't fucking sleep!

51:34.352 --> 51:36.310
I bet you sleep like a
fucking baby though, don't you?

51:36.354 --> 51:38.399
- I believe
in what I'm doing. Yes.

51:38.443 --> 51:40.793
- Yeah? I don't.
I quit. I'm out.

51:40.836 --> 51:44.188
I am fucking done with this
and I'm fucking done with you.

51:49.410 --> 51:50.237
Forget him.

51:55.068 --> 51:56.635
Maybe he's what you said.

51:58.593 --> 52:00.160
But she wasn't.

52:02.902 --> 52:05.774
I'll tell you
what we just did.

52:05.818 --> 52:07.820
Some day she's going
to have kids,

52:07.863 --> 52:09.387
and those kids are going
to hear about

52:09.430 --> 52:11.476
how their grandfather died,

52:11.519 --> 52:14.392
and all we did was make the next
generation of terrorists.

52:15.958 --> 52:19.310
[music]

52:21.964 --> 52:23.227
[door closes]

52:25.794 --> 52:27.840
[music]

52:41.419 --> 52:42.550
[speaking Arabic]

53:03.702 --> 53:06.357
[music]

53:45.918 --> 53:47.659
- [Errol sighs]

53:47.702 --> 53:51.010
Brent crude is down eight
dollars a barrel in pre-trading.

53:54.100 --> 53:57.799
- I never understood pre-trading
and after-hours trading.

53:57.843 --> 53:59.888
If the market has...

53:59.932 --> 54:03.762
a starting bell
and a closing bell,

54:03.805 --> 54:06.765
who gets to trade
around the bells?

54:06.808 --> 54:08.897
- The people who
control the bell.

54:10.899 --> 54:13.162
- Now we're getting somewhere.

54:13.206 --> 54:15.513
- You act like
you don't know this.

54:15.556 --> 54:17.384
- I don't.

54:17.428 --> 54:20.474
- I love it when you act naive.

54:20.518 --> 54:24.565
- I'm not naive,
I'm just curious.

54:24.609 --> 54:28.787
- If you're really curious, you
should ask me who rings it.

54:30.571 --> 54:34.706
[music]

55:03.561 --> 55:04.692
[setting bags down]

55:05.780 --> 55:06.999
[Neal] Hey.

55:08.130 --> 55:09.958
- You're up early.

55:10.002 --> 55:12.874
- Yeah, well I don't sleep
when you're gone.

55:12.918 --> 55:15.616
- I'm always gone.

55:15.660 --> 55:18.358
- That's why I have grey hair
and bags. I worry.

55:27.062 --> 55:28.455
[Joe sighs]

55:33.547 --> 55:36.855
- Here.

55:36.898 --> 55:38.944
Looks like you
don't sleep either.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.694
- This one was hard.

55:51.304 --> 55:52.610
- I can see that.
- Yeah.

55:54.002 --> 55:57.963
[crying]

55:58.006 --> 56:03.577
[music]

56:03.621 --> 56:04.796
- Come here.

56:08.060 --> 56:10.758
It's okay, baby.
You're home now.

56:12.804 --> 56:14.632
- It was really hard.

56:17.461 --> 56:20.028
[crying]

56:22.074 --> 56:26.600
[music]

56:31.736 --> 56:33.651
[crying continues]

56:40.614 --> 56:44.096
