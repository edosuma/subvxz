00:03.795 --> 00:04.921
Can I help you?

00:05.004 --> 00:06.214
{\an3}Yeah. We called
in a prescription

00:06.297 --> 00:07.382
{\an3}for clozapine
this afternoon.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.467
Name's Durning.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.972
{\an1}He's gonna see there are
no refills allowed.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.309
Check it out.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.562
This prescription
doesn't allow for a refill.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.272
Right. When I called in
this afternoon,

00:22.355 --> 00:23.732
I explained that her doctor
is out of town

00:23.815 --> 00:24.691
{\an3}and, uh...

00:24.774 --> 00:26.568
Probably has a service.
You want me to try it?

00:26.651 --> 00:30.321
No. Uh, that is,
we need the pills now.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.156
Nothing I can do.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.284
{\an1}I'm sorry.

We've been together.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.776
Yeah, and as I recall,
it was pretty great, wasn't it?

01:07.859 --> 01:09.152
(sighs)
I knew I shouldn't have gone

01:09.235 --> 01:10.987
to that Valentine's Day party
with you.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.655
Or come on the radio last week.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.073
Or kissed you.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.325
But you did.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.951

01:17.035 --> 01:18.036
{\an1}Yes.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.832

01:24.417 --> 01:26.503
Yeah.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.504
Most of it.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.672
Most, but not all.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.707
No.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.376
Why, because you don't want to?

02:06.459 --> 02:07.877
Because I can't.

{\an1}Just makes no sense
how we broke up over nothing.

I don't know.

{\an3}You and Gina looked

04:46.995 --> 04:48.204

04:50.665 --> 04:51.708
I even tried to steal.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.084
That's how desperate we are.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.587
You know, I use to work
at this clinic,

04:56.671 --> 04:59.549
and I knew these two patients--
one had cancer and one had AIDS.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.467
{\an3}And both of them
were trying to get

05:01.551 --> 05:04.470
their hands on some drugs
that had been banned here.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.555

05:05.638 --> 05:07.932
So they went down to Mexico
and they bought them,

05:08.016 --> 05:09.559
and they smuggled them
back across the border.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.060
I know it's illegal,

05:11.144 --> 05:12.562
but you said you were desperate.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.022
Yeah, and willing to do

05:14.105 --> 05:15.565
the wrong thing
for the right reason.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.401
So maybe I can call them
and they can give me

05:18.484 --> 05:20.236
the names of people
who can help you.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.030
Uh, I don't know.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.407
I mean,
it sounds great, except...

05:24.490 --> 05:26.409
I-I-I can't take
Lauren with me.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.578
{\an1}And I, and I can't
leave her here.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.204
Why?
Is she getting worse?

05:30.288 --> 05:31.414
No, but she's out of pills,

05:31.497 --> 05:33.082
and now it's only
a matter of time.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.417
I'm sorry.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.376
{\an1}It's like

05:35.460 --> 05:37.420
she'll go in and out
at first, you know?

05:37.503 --> 05:40.423
She'll have, like, this really--
I don't know-- bizarre moment,

05:40.506 --> 05:41.758
{\an1}and the next thing
you know,

05:41.841 --> 05:44.594
she's, like, totally normal.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.637
Once it starts, though, she'll
be overwhelmed pretty quickly.

05:48.347 --> 05:51.434
I don't know; thanks for
the Mexican angle though.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.561
There really is
nothing I can do.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.481
Yeah, I guess not.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.608
{\an3}But maybe there's
something I can do.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.238
You're opening
your own gym?

06:04.322 --> 06:06.616
{\an3}That, uh, sounds
expensive.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.450
Yeah, it is.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.286
{\an1}But I'm borrowing
against my trust fund.

06:10.369 --> 06:11.496
You have a trust fund?

06:11.579 --> 06:12.497
Yeah, well,

06:12.580 --> 06:14.415
it's called exhibition fees.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.251
Basically, it's money I earned
skating while I was a minor.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.003
I asked my mom
to bring the paperwork.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.463
Did you earn a lot?

06:20.546 --> 06:21.798
Well, not by
Beverly Hills standards,

06:21.881 --> 06:25.134
but I did okay for trash.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.260
Gina, we've been over this.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.428
I never should have said that.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.805
But you did.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.598
Well, I was upset
about you and Noah.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.810
Donna, there is no me and Noah.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.104
I know, but you need
to understand that

06:36.187 --> 06:37.480
{\an3}the way that
it looked

06:37.563 --> 06:40.441
and what
I thought happened, I...

06:40.525 --> 06:43.444
I just, I'm gonna need a little
bit of time to get over that.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.780
Okay.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.490
Yeah, I-I understand.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.909

06:54.789 --> 06:55.748

07:00.878 --> 07:02.296

07:02.380 --> 07:03.297
{\an3}look who's
all grown up.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.299
(both chuckle)

07:05.383 --> 07:06.551
You look great.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.010
Oh, thanks.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.638
Another 10 pounds and I'll
match my driver's license.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.557

07:12.640 --> 07:16.394
Oh, isn't this
just a slice of heaven?!

07:16.477 --> 07:17.770
{\an3}Mom, did you bring
the trust information?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.522
It is sheer heaven.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.357
I tell you, sheer heaven.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.528
Mom, I just asked you if you
brought the trust stuff.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.071
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.573
I completely forgot, honey.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.741
I told you it was important.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.410
And I told you I was sorry.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.413
{\an1}Aunt Bobbi, why don't
you sit down and relax?

07:35.496 --> 07:38.374
Oh, thanks.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.629
{\an1}The trust was set up
here, you know.

07:43.713 --> 07:44.380
A place called

07:44.463 --> 07:46.632
Cooper, Adams and Savin.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.385
{\an3}Yeah, yeah, I-I...
I know them.

07:49.468 --> 07:51.470
{\an3}Uh, my dad has a couple
accounts there.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.055
{\an1}Oh, will you take me
there later?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.557
{\an3}Yeah, sure.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.061
Celebrity trash?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.730
What kind of story is that?

08:00.813 --> 08:02.899
{\an1}Actually,
what we do is kidding.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.066
we target a celebrity

08:04.150 --> 08:05.568
and go through
a day's worth

08:05.651 --> 08:07.737
of their trash
and publish what we find.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.905
I'd read that artiMom.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.907
He, he is kidding.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.408
Steve, tell my parents
you're kidding.

08:12.491 --> 08:15.411
Have I mentioned what
a great reporter Janet is?

08:15.494 --> 08:18.039
How smart and diligent she is?

08:18.122 --> 08:20.583
Oh, Steve's just, uh,
he's just impressed

08:20.666 --> 08:23.211
that I occasionally insist
we base our stories in fact.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.254
{\an3}No, no, working with her
is really great.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.049
Which is why I was a little
worried when we started to...

08:28.132 --> 08:31.219
{\an3}Working together
even more...

08:31.302 --> 08:34.222
{\an3}...than we already
are because

08:34.304 --> 08:36.349
that would mean...

08:37.515 --> 08:39.434
Yeah.lot of work.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.437
What I meant to say was

08:41.520 --> 08:43.438
Well, Steve's,

08:43.522 --> 08:44.440
Steve's a great boss.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.275
Which is great

08:46.359 --> 08:48.611
because that's what he is--

08:48.694 --> 08:51.447
{\an3}my boss.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.908
But being a reporter
is an honorable profession.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.453
{\an1}Why degrade
the story with...

08:57.536 --> 08:58.788
garbage?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.915
{\an3}Well, they're not
stories about garbage.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.458
They're stories about secrets.

09:02.541 --> 09:05.586
And it's amazing what people
don't want revealed.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.797
{\an1}I think people
deserve their privacy.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.965
So do I.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.509
And I think people
hide way too much.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.552

09:20.768 --> 09:22.436

09:33.698 --> 09:36.450

09:36.534 --> 09:38.077

09:38.160 --> 09:40.538

09:40.621 --> 09:41.831

09:43.582 --> 09:45.001

09:45.084 --> 09:46.460
Yes, day after tomorrow.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.878
I'm looking forward to it.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.139

all the how-to books
on relationships?

09:59.557 --> 10:00.599
I'm afraid so.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.726
Oh-ho...

10:01.809 --> 10:03.477
{\an1}The station's pairing
us up for a show.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.396

well, they'll make it
something permanent.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.190

{\an1}Yeah, yeah, yeah,
what about it?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.402
Well, as it turns out, I can.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.695
Mm-hmm.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.571
Good..

10:55.654 --> 10:56.405
Good.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.698
OAll right.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.575
Yeah.

10:59.658 --> 11:02.244
Uh, when you're ready to go to
the bank, I'll be at the store.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.579
{\an1}Okay.reat.

11:03.662 --> 11:05.247
Um... See you.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.540
{\an1}Okay.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.753
{\an1}You're going out
on a date with Donna?

11:10.836 --> 11:12.421
Oh.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.507
No. It's-It's not...

11:18.010 --> 11:19.595
Actually, yeah.
Yeah, we are.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.556
{\an1}Oh, well, um,
that's-that's cool.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.600
{\an4}I mean, you don't have
to be embarrassed or
anything about it.

11:24.683 --> 11:27.395
{\an1}It's not like you were
plotting Noah's overthrow.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.480
Is it?

11:29.563 --> 11:32.233
No. No, it isn't.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.443
(laughing):
Oh... wow.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.945
Has anyone ever told you

11:36.028 --> 11:38.280
{\an1}that you're
an adorably bad liar?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.784
It's nothing.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.203
Uh-huh.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.663
It's nothing.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.291
Okay.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.168
Donna and I went out
on Valentine's Day.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.421
You did?

11:54.505 --> 11:55.506
{\an3}No.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.800
No, we didn't do that.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.759
{\an3}We...

11:58.843 --> 12:01.512
kissed.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.805
You kissed?!

12:02.888 --> 12:08.477
{\an1}Okay. Uh, so I guess one thing
is just kind of...

12:08.561 --> 12:10.479
leading to the next?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.065
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.449
Well, I got a map here
of the stars' homes.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.784
We'll target the ones based on
their easily accessible trash

12:23.868 --> 12:25.870
and then we're off.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.122
Did you hear me?

12:28.205 --> 12:29.498
Unfortunately.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.375
{\an1}(sighs)
You know, Janet,

12:31.459 --> 12:33.461
technically, I'm the one who
should be angry about lunch.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.629
{\an3}I told you I
wanted to go alone.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.339
{\an1}Yeah, but you didn't
tell me why.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.716
You know, if you're embarrassed

12:38.799 --> 12:40.509
{\an1}to tell you know
your parents about me,

12:40.593 --> 12:42.011
{\an1}the least you could do
is say so.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.471
I'm not embarrassed.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.139
You wouldn't let me touch you.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.475
Touching's fine.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.018
But you-you pawed me.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.811
Aw, come on.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.314
You're complaining because
I wanted to hold your hand?

12:53.397 --> 12:55.524
{\an3}Look, my-my father's
traditional.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.693
{\an1}So? Does that mean
you can't have a boyfriend?

12:57.776 --> 12:59.028
No, of course I can.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.530
Then you are embarrassed.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.573
No.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.367
{\an1}Then what? It is
about me, isn't it?

13:05.451 --> 13:07.536
In a way.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.872
{\an3}But, um, just
not how you think.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.248
What other way is there?

13:11.332 --> 13:12.500
(sighs)

13:12.583 --> 13:16.545
My father just wants me to be
with someone who's Japanese.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.713
Oh.

13:17.796 --> 13:21.550
{\an3}And he doesn't approve of
me dating anyone who isn't.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.642
WOMAN:
<i>Mm-hmm. Thank you.</i>

13:32.061 --> 13:34.730
{\an3}Hi. Uh, I'm, uh,
Gina Kincaid

13:34.813 --> 13:36.565
{\an3}and this is my cousin
Donna Martin.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.568
We're here about a trust account
that was opened in Gina's name

13:39.652 --> 13:40.736
about eight years ago.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.196
{\an1}I just want to find out
how much is in it.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.240
I know that I can't have
the money until I'm 25,

13:44.323 --> 13:47.284
but I want to use it
as collateral for this gym

13:47.368 --> 13:48.577
that I'm going to open.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.412
Mm-hmm.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.288
Oh, here Great.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.208
I figure there's
about $75,000 in there.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.293
Am I close?

13:56.377 --> 13:57.419
Actually, there's less.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.088
{\an1}Yes.less?

13:59.171 --> 14:04.051
Currently in the account,
there's $14,216.

14:05.636 --> 14:06.428
Wait.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.264
$14,000?

14:08.347 --> 14:09.598
...216.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.934
I'm sorry, I think
there's been some mistake.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.227
Could you check again?

14:13.310 --> 14:15.437
Well, I'm sorry,
but that's not really necessary.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.773
Wait a minute-- I know
that I earned at least

14:17.856 --> 14:20.067
$60,000...

14:20.150 --> 14:22.486
{\an3}and with any kind
of investment portfolio,

14:22.570 --> 14:25.239
there has to be
some way that...

14:25.322 --> 14:27.575
If there was ever that kind
of money in this account,

14:27.658 --> 14:28.867
it's not there anymore.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.920
{\an3}So let me get
this straight now.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.464
You... You want
to help Lauren?

14:42.548 --> 14:45.759
Is that so hard to believe?

14:45.843 --> 14:47.094
{\an3}Well...

14:47.177 --> 14:49.597
She's Matt's wife
and, you know...

14:49.680 --> 14:51.974
{\an1}And she's in
a terrible situation.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.059
{\an1}One which
we can help her with.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.811
{\an3}We?

14:55.894 --> 14:58.480
Yeah, yeah, I know
some contacts in Mexico

14:58.564 --> 15:00.274
who could get us clozapine.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.109
{\an1}And you have
the money to get it.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.277
Mm-hmm.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.695
What?

15:04.778 --> 15:07.615
It's funny.
See, a couple of months ago,

15:07.698 --> 15:11.118
I was the one dragging you
to Mexico.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.163
As I recall, you were dragging
quite a few women to Mexico.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.623
Gina was my second choice.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.124
{\an3}After you made
it perfectly clear

15:17.207 --> 15:19.543
to me, anyway,
that Matt was your first.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.503
Are you going to help me or not?

15:21.587 --> 15:22.421
{\an3}Sure.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.673
As soon as you admit
it's gonna be fun.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.135
It is a mission of mercy.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.094
Of course it is;
but there's still

15:29.178 --> 15:31.055
the opportunity
to have fun along the way.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.224
All right,
it has possibilities.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.435
(knocking at door)

15:36.518 --> 15:38.979
Excuse me.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.315
(clears throat)

15:42.483 --> 15:43.692
Hi.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.818
Want to have dinner?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.528
Uh, not a good time for me.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.744
{\an3}Oh. Hi.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.371
Hi.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.705
What's going on?

15:56.789 --> 15:58.207
Dylan and I are going to Mexico.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.627
{\an1}To buy drugs,
uh, for Lauren.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.587
Oh, you guys are
going to Mexico?

16:03.671 --> 16:06.215
That sounds familiar.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.300
{\an1}Uh, but,
we're through here now

16:08.384 --> 16:10.427
{\an1}and-and dinner
sounds really good.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.763
{\an3}No, actually you two
should have dinner

16:12.846 --> 16:14.598
because I just, uh,

16:14.682 --> 16:16.725
lost my appetite.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.325
(rock music blaring)

16:36.578 --> 16:37.746
Do you know what time it is?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.081
I didn't turn it on.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.791
{\an3}Oh, it must be
Matt and Lauren.

16:40.874 --> 16:41.917
You guys seen Lauren?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.168
I thought she was with you.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.715
{\an3}I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you guys up.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.883
That's all right, it's okay.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.428
I couldn't find
the... the earphones.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.595
{\an1}It's okay, Lauren,
It's okay, it's okay.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.055
You always play your music
that loud?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.098
{\an1}Of course not. Could you
find me the headphones please?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.433
Sure.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.268
{\an3}I needed to drown
out the Voices?

16:59.351 --> 17:00.436
Could you get me the damn
headphones?

17:00.519 --> 17:01.645
I got it, I got it.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.732
Are you okay? Okay.

17:04.815 --> 17:05.941
Come here sit down, come on.

17:06.023 --> 17:08.026
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.236
The voices, Steve.
The ones that are telling her

17:09.319 --> 17:10.445
she's a descendent
of Queen Elizabeth.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.114
{\an3}The ones telling her
if she looks at the face

17:12.196 --> 17:13.073
{\an3}of anyone pictured on the
cover of <i> Time</i> magazine,

17:13.156 --> 17:14.282
she's gonna die.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.367
The ones telling her walk

17:15.451 --> 17:17.911
{\an3}to the nearest freeway
and face oncoming traffic.

17:19.747 --> 17:20.789
See, they're whispers now.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.249
{\an1}So, she throws on headphones,
she can drown them out.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.959
{\an3}But, uh...

17:24.041 --> 17:25.586
see, they'll become voices
and then they're commands.

17:25.669 --> 17:26.837
And then it's just...

17:26.920 --> 17:29.173
They're unavoidable.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.635
I'm sorry I yelled, guys.
I didn't... didn't, uh...

17:33.719 --> 17:35.929
{\an3}Hey, don't sweat it.
I'm sorry.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.973
Sorry, man.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.100
{\an3}LAUREN:
Hey.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.606
Okay.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.954
(phone beeps off)

18:02.080 --> 18:04.416
{\an1}Ooh,<i> chicle.</i>
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

18:04.500 --> 18:05.626
Still no answer.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.628
{\an1}Uh, he knows
we're coming, though.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.380
Maybe we should just go.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.132
Uh, maybe
this wasn't a good idea.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.383
{\an1}Oh, come on.
Spending the day in Mexico?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.719
Always a good idea.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.514
Thank you for coming
down here with me.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.724
It means a lot.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.059
{\an1}Well, when I get my miracle
second chance,

18:22.142 --> 18:23.519
you'd do the same for me.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.729
Considering why we're down here,
do you still think

18:25.813 --> 18:29.191
that Matt and Lauren's second
chance is so miraculous?

18:29.274 --> 18:31.068
Yeah, absolutely.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.695
So you would want Antonia back?

18:33.779 --> 18:35.864
{\an3}Even if you knew you had
to give her up again?

18:35.948 --> 18:40.077
Make no mistakes, Kel, I would
do anything to get Antonia back.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.497
{\an1}I mean, knowing that
there's an end, you, uh...

18:43.580 --> 18:44.706
It allows you
to orchestrate

18:44.790 --> 18:46.834
and say the things you always
wanted to say.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.043
Wouldn't you want that?

18:48.126 --> 18:51.213
With who?

18:51.296 --> 18:54.091
With somebody
that you once loved.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.927
Who meant a lot to you

18:57.010 --> 19:00.514
and then, for whatever reason,
just wasn't there anymore.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.564
Maybe I should try again.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.899
{\an1}Yeah. Second time's
always the charm.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.239
Now you're taking my money?
That's great, Mom.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.033
{\an1}I spent your money,
but I spent it on you.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.869
On, on coaches

19:21.952 --> 19:23.412
and traveling to exhibitions
and-and equipment and...

19:23.495 --> 19:26.582
{\an3}Okay, Aunt Bobbi.
Gina understands that.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.583
{\an3}But there are some
additional expenses.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.085
Yeah, additional.
What's this?

19:30.168 --> 19:32.588
What, you-you had to remodel
the master bath in '93?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.839
You had to, right?

19:33.922 --> 19:35.090
{\an3}You had to get a
'94 Ford Explorer, mom?

19:35.173 --> 19:37.092
A dishwasher, a TV?

19:37.175 --> 19:39.261
Here you go.
New life for you.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.763
I gave up my life for you.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.766
And whatever I got in return...

19:44.850 --> 19:46.852
I more than paid for.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.145
No.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.065
You robbed me of my childhood...

19:52.149 --> 19:54.401
and now you're taking my money.

19:54.484 --> 19:58.739
You know, Mom, the first one
I'll never be able to get back.

19:58.822 --> 20:02.576
But the second one
I damn well better.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.127
{\an3}Okay, you get the trunk,
I'll get the trash.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.130
This is an all-time low.

20:15.213 --> 20:18.091
No, that would be hiding our
relationship from your family.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.635
I'm gonnaYeah, sure.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.471
{\an1}I told you, my father's
traditional.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.097
Which is a daughter's way
of saying your dad's a bigot.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.933
He is not a bigot.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.435
Look, I know there are
a lot of reasons

20:28.518 --> 20:29.978
for your father
to disapprove of me.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.022
The color of my skin
should not be one of them.

20:32.105 --> 20:36.985
He just he feels really strongly
about preserving his heritage.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.320
So he's controlling
his daughter's life?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.155
He just feels like his culture

20:40.238 --> 20:41.823
is slipping away, you know?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.116
And being replaced
by an American one.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.368
Well, that's understandable,

20:44.451 --> 20:46.036
considering
he's living in America.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.497
Well,
he doesn't see it that way.

20:48.580 --> 20:53.585
{\an1}Which is why he's arranged
for me to meet someone.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.836
Arranged?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.713
ArraArranged.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.840
{\an1}Like...

20:58.924 --> 21:00.634
you know, for dinner.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.135
Tonight.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.513
So he's already
set this up with some Asian guy?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.192
{\an3}(groans)

21:17.275 --> 21:18.026
He's not here.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.361
Well, I'm not surprised.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.697
{\an1}He hasn't been here
in a couple days.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.492
(voices in distance,
getting closer)

21:26.576 --> 21:28.537
{\an3}I felt kind of bad
about bothering him.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.205
Well, you need advice a lot
better than I can give you.

21:30.288 --> 21:33.041
Hey. For you.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.543
{\an1}Look, I know
what you're doing.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.796
{\an1}And I appreciate it.
But I... I can't take them.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.590
For what?.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.509
Advice from someone
who got me in this mess?

21:42.592 --> 21:45.554
I was just going to tell you
that Donna was with David.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.848
{\an1}Couple nights ago
No, no.club-- I already know.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.016
I'm saying
that she was with him

21:49.099 --> 21:50.017
before you guys broke up.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.727
(wry laugh)

21:51.810 --> 21:53.061
Like I'm gonna believe you.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.521
Whatever. It's your life.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.064
{\an3}Hmm?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.066
I'm just sayingith"--

21:58.150 --> 21:59.901
that the whole time
she was freaking out

21:59.985 --> 22:01.319
about our little peck
on the cheek,

22:01.403 --> 22:03.238
she was having a little
Valentine's Day smooch-fest

22:03.321 --> 22:04.197
with David.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.198
Really.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.283
Yeah, really.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.494
Nice flowers.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.416
You say you know what I'm doing,
but I don't think you do.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.752
Look, I'm just not ready
to get back together.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.879
Okay, why don't we try
forgiving each other, then?

22:18.962 --> 22:20.047
Well, I don't know what I did

22:20.130 --> 22:21.089
that you feel
the need to forgive.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.758
{\an3}But as for
what you did,

22:22.841 --> 22:24.217
I need time for that, too.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.595
No. Because of you.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.597
{\an1}So it's got nothing at all
That's right.vid?

22:28.680 --> 22:31.099
Even though you kissed him
on Valentine's Day?

22:31.183 --> 22:32.809
Still don't know why
you need forgiving?

22:32.893 --> 22:34.603
It doesn't excuse what you did.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.230
No, it doesn't-- but we did
exactly the same thing.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.940
{\an4}And you're giving me
all this nonsense
about me and Gina

22:39.024 --> 22:40.525
and breaking your trust?

22:41.943 --> 22:43.487
You're a hypocrite.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.625
<i>Janet, dear,</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:58.001
look who's here.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.671
{\an3}Steve, uh,
what a surprise.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.257
{\an1}I, uh, wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important,

23:04.341 --> 23:07.094
{\an1}uh, but we have a deadline--
I just need two minutes.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.428
{\an3}Please.
I'm sorry.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.639
Um, I'll-I'll be
right back.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.102
What? You and I both know
we're not on a deadline.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.686
You can't do this.

23:16.770 --> 23:17.979
I'm not doing anything.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.815
Oh, come on,
you're being set up.

23:19.898 --> 23:24.111
{\an5}(sighs)
Steve, I'm just
humoring my dad, okay?

23:24.194 --> 23:26.363
That's it, nothing more,
IReally?e.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.115
'Cause in my eyes, it looks like

23:28.198 --> 23:29.491
you're already married
with children.

23:29.574 --> 23:30.826
Hi, beautiful!

23:30.909 --> 23:32.077
Hey, Peter.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.036
{\an1}PETER:
Everything okay?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.122
{\an1}JANET: Yeah, everything's...
everything's fine.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.999
Um, I'll-I'll
be right over.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.209
Okay!

23:39.292 --> 23:41.169
{\an1}(laughs):
Okay.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.214
What?

23:44.297 --> 23:46.508
Well, it's just,
uh, it's just good

23:46.591 --> 23:49.219
to be able to size up
the competition, is all.

23:49.302 --> 23:52.013
Uh, you're not competing
with Peter.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.348
Well, that's for sure.

23:53.431 --> 23:55.100
You're competing with Bob.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.897
He's a Princeton grad,
Phi Beta Kappa.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.941
{\an1}Owns his own
software company.

24:03.024 --> 24:06.194
{\an3}Did you tell him about
us, or should I?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.572
I think you should go.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.037
(knocking)

24:16.121 --> 24:17.539
Hey.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.874
How's Matt?

24:18.957 --> 24:20.333
{\an3}Uh, yeah, I
talked to him,

24:20.417 --> 24:23.044
and I told him that
he was out of luck.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.588
Well, at least for now.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.548
{\an1}I mean, we might find
someone tomorrow.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.049
Yeah. I've been
thinking, Dylan.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.551
I don't think I can do this.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.553
I don't think
I can go through with it.

24:31.636 --> 24:34.389
{\an1}I tell you what-- why
don't you sleep on it, Kel,

24:34.472 --> 24:36.850
{\an1}you might... you might
feel different tomorrow.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.226
(clears throat)

24:38.310 --> 24:40.061
{\an1}In the meantime,
here's a toothbrush,

24:40.145 --> 24:42.772
{\an1}uh, shampoo, toothpaste,
just the basics.

24:42.856 --> 24:43.899
{\an3}Thank you.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.818
{\an1}Um, checkout time
is 12:00 noon,

24:46.902 --> 24:49.070
and you can forget
about room service pretty much.

24:49.154 --> 24:53.074
But, uh, if you need anything,
I'll just be across the hall.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.076
Thanks.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.454
Just... right... over there.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.080
Oh, yeah, across the hall.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.207
Okay.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.668
{\an1}Dylan...

25:04.669 --> 25:06.254
You forgot this.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.589
(sighs):
Yeah.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.090
Um...

25:09.174 --> 25:10.467
This...

25:10.550 --> 25:12.886
feels... different.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.262
Different how?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.431
{\an1}Yeah, different than
last time we were here.

25:16.514 --> 25:17.515
Oh.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.024
It's more comfortYeah.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.484
Yeah.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.986
Less stMm-hmm.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.920
(pounding on door)

25:47.003 --> 25:49.506
I can't believe you!

25:49.589 --> 25:50.465
What?

25:50.548 --> 25:52.509
Pretending to be my friend,
that's what!

25:52.592 --> 25:54.636
{\an3}Noah, what the hell
are Going after Donna?

25:54.719 --> 25:57.013
And then listening to me
talk about Gina, and you get

25:57.097 --> 26:00.642
Look, I didn't
t"go after" Donna, okay??

26:00.725 --> 26:02.435
There's an explanation.
Tell me there's an explanation.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.688
I can't.

26:04.771 --> 26:05.814
I thought you were my friend.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.402
My bad.

26:20.578 --> 26:23.331
Hey, it's almost 9:00.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.500
Oh, it's a little
early to be up...

26:25.583 --> 26:27.627
{\an1}and in a bad mood,
isn't it?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.838
I'm not in a mood;
I want to go home.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.673
Mm, empty-handed?

26:31.756 --> 26:35.844
I told you yesterday, I think
coming down here was... wrong.

26:35.927 --> 26:39.514
Actually, you said
you weren't sure.

26:39.597 --> 26:41.641
What changed your mind?

26:42.600 --> 26:45.312
{\an1}Oh, cheating
on Matt-- mmm.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.314
He's married, Kel.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.858
I'll repent... Gina?

26:49.941 --> 26:52.110
later-- come on.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.365
Why don't you get dressed
and meet me downstairs.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.577
No, why don't you get undressed
and stay up here with me.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.412
Dylan, I want to go.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.708
{\an1}Last night was
pretty great, Kel.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.086
Yeah.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.549
(door opens)

27:14.632 --> 27:16.634
(door (sighs)

27:18.803 --> 27:19.721
STEVE:
<i>Nonfat milk,</i>

27:19.804 --> 27:22.891
fat-free cottage cheese,

27:22.974 --> 27:24.893
nonfat yogurt, heh...

27:24.976 --> 27:27.354
{\an3}Newsflash: Movie star
watches her weight.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.730
You <i> could</i> help.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.565
I could, but I'm not going to.

27:30.648 --> 27:31.691
Let me guess.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.693
Your father would disapprove.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.111
No,<i> I</i> disapprove.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.530
You know, Janet,
you once told me

27:37.614 --> 27:39.532
that your father was a hippie,

27:39.616 --> 27:41.701
{\an1}and that he believed
Right.e love.

27:42.660 --> 27:43.578
{\an1}Oh.ied.

27:43.661 --> 27:45.789
Well, I understand that--
I mean, who wants

27:45.872 --> 27:47.540
to admit that
their father's a racist?

27:47.624 --> 27:48.958
You know what,
there's nothing racist

27:49.042 --> 27:51.378
about wanting to spend
the rest of your life

27:51.461 --> 27:53.129
with someone with shared values.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.881
<i>We</i> have shared values.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.050
Steve, you're
sorting through trash.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.928
{\an1}Yeah, and I own a tabloid
and I'm white and my mom's gay

28:00.011 --> 28:02.097
{\an1}and I love you and I
love the Three Stooges,

28:02.180 --> 28:03.681
so who cares about the rest?

28:03.765 --> 28:05.600
What did you just say?

28:05.683 --> 28:06.810
I said
I love the Three Stooges.

28:06.893 --> 28:09.813
(whooping like Curly)

28:09.896 --> 28:11.231
Hello, Janet.

28:11.314 --> 28:12.816
Dad, hi.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.651
{\an3}BEN:
Uh,

28:14.734 --> 28:15.819
hard at work I see.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.612
Yeah, up to my elbows.

28:17.695 --> 28:19.489
Could we talk?

28:19.572 --> 28:20.657
Yeah.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.492
About last night.

28:22.575 --> 28:25.078
I thought Bob was terrific.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.290
Yeah, Dad, he was...
he was really great.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.627
{\an3}And he would be a really
great catch for me

28:32.710 --> 28:34.712
if I were looking for a
boyfriend, but I'm not.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.133
I already have one.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.516
(man speaking Spanish)

28:46.599 --> 28:48.309
Afternoon, folks.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.811
Bring anything over the border
you need to declare?

28:49.894 --> 28:50.979
{\an1}KELLY:
Uh,

28:51.062 --> 28:52.313

28:52.397 --> 28:53.648
{\an3}No fruits,

28:53.731 --> 28:54.649
vegetables or medicines?

28:54.732 --> 28:55.984
{\an1}DYLAN:
No.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.654
{\an1}No fruits, vegetables
and definitely no medicines.

28:59.737 --> 29:01.322
Is everything all right, miss?

29:01.406 --> 29:03.491
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.663
Go on, tell him the truth.

29:08.746 --> 29:10.665
{\an1}You want to know
why she's nervous?

29:10.748 --> 29:12.667
{\an1}Now, look,
we used to date.

29:12.750 --> 29:13.668
Right? Me and her.

29:13.751 --> 29:14.669
And we come down here

29:14.752 --> 29:16.004
last night, and,

29:16.087 --> 29:17.505
you know, things happened,

29:17.589 --> 29:19.132
and apparently,
some of the old magic come back.

29:19.215 --> 29:21.176
{\an1}We both got in touch
with feelings that we thought

29:21.259 --> 29:22.177
were behind us,
especially her...

29:22.260 --> 29:23.178
That... This is not true.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.179
'Cause my girl's
gonna need a lot

29:24.262 --> 29:25.513
of therapy, but ultimately

29:25.597 --> 29:26.681
{\an1}KELLY:
What are you talking about?

29:26.764 --> 29:28.683
she seduces me, okay?

29:28.766 --> 29:30.018
I seduced you?
You were all over me!

29:30.101 --> 29:31.186
I cheat on my girlfriend,
and then

29:31.269 --> 29:32.896
{\an1}she's giving me
I can't believeer,

29:32.979 --> 29:34.355

29:34.439 --> 29:35.982

Move along, okay?es.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.525
{\an1}KELLY:
Move along, okay?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.736
{\an3}Okay.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.492
Would you mind telling
me what that was about?

29:45.575 --> 29:47.869
{\an1}Huh, yeah, he was about
to search the car.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.038
{\an1}So? We didn't
Uh,ggle anything.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.706
we didn't, no, but I did.

29:51.789 --> 29:53.541
{\an1}One bottle of clozapine,
as ordered.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.918
(clears throat)

29:55.960 --> 29:57.712
(Kelly sighs)

29:57.795 --> 29:59.380
I thought
we agreed not to do this.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.465
Wait a minute, Kel.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.717
You changed your mind.
I didn't change anything, okay?

30:02.800 --> 30:05.386
Your contact called, you were
out of the room, so I arranged

30:05.470 --> 30:08.723
a little meet and greet,
and, uh, I handled it.

30:08.806 --> 30:09.516
Why didn't you tell me?

30:09.599 --> 30:10.600
{\an1}'Cause I knew
you wouldn't approve.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.060
Just like our friendly

30:12.143 --> 30:13.853
neighborhood customs agent
back there.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.730
{\an1}That's why
I said all that

30:15.813 --> 30:16.606
stuff I said to him about us.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.191
Right.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.693
So you didn't mean any
of that stuff?

30:20.777 --> 30:22.695
About us, you know,

30:22.779 --> 30:23.530
our feelings?

30:23.613 --> 30:25.865
No... not a word.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.450
Good, good. Neither did I.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.539
DONNA:
<i>Gina and I caught up with Matt.</i>

30:32.622 --> 30:33.706
<i>He was</i>

30:33.790 --> 30:34.832
incredibly helpful.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.709
(gentle piano music plays)

30:36.793 --> 30:38.378
So, who's the trustee?

30:38.461 --> 30:40.547
{\an1}Gina doesn't know,
but according to Matt,

30:40.630 --> 30:42.549
it's probably the bank.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.884
Well, the bank's responsible
for how the money's spent.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.553
Or misspent.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.221
{\an1}So even though
Bobbi was irresponsible...

30:48.304 --> 30:50.098
{\an3}The bank's on the line
to pay her back,

30:50.181 --> 30:51.975
{\an3}and since the bank has
conveniently deep pockets,

30:52.058 --> 30:53.560
she should get
her money back.

30:53.643 --> 30:54.644
And more.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.230
And I told her she should go
for pain and suffering.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.773
Let's hope she handles it

30:58.856 --> 31:01.943
in a more civilized way
than Noah.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.861
Well, he shouldn't have
lost hNo.temper.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.488
He shouldn't have canceled
my show with Dr. Fowler.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.781
That's what he shouldn't
have done.

31:06.864 --> 31:08.491
But he does have a reason
to be upset.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.867
After all,
we kept a secret from him.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.413
It was a tiny secret.
It was a speck.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.498
Not so tiny that we didn't
feel the need to hide it.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.500
And it hurts finding out.
Believe me, I know.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.669
You don't want me to feel
sorry for the guy, fine.

31:19.752 --> 31:22.797
I just... I don't think
he treated you well.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.007
The point is

31:24.090 --> 31:25.508
that he's alone,
and we're together.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.510
That's what I'd like
to focus on--

31:27.594 --> 31:29.012
you and I being together.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.681
I know.
I just feel bad.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.933
Yeah, I know you do.

31:34.017 --> 31:36.185
He is a good guy,
and I hurt him.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.605
I'm sorry.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.480
It's okay.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.482
No.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.067
I really am sorry.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.159
(door opening)

31:51.242 --> 31:52.660
{\an3}(music plMATT:
over headLauren?

31:52.744 --> 31:53.828
Hi.

31:53.911 --> 31:55.330
(music stops)

31:55.413 --> 31:57.332
I'm telling you this
judge is a nightmare.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.667
I know. You told me.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.669
{\an1}You called me 15 times
to check on me.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.338
{\an3}I know, but four hours
for a continuance?

32:03.421 --> 32:05.173
{\an3}I'm sorry. I should never
have been gone so long.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.382
I am so sorry.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.675
No, no, it's okay.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.177
I'm glad you were.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.305
It gave me a chance to look
forward to you coming home.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.431
All right.eally nice.

32:13.514 --> 32:17.018
{\an1}I haven't had anything to look
forward to in a long time.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.686
All right, come here.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.687
I'm sorry.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.648
(knocking)

32:21.731 --> 32:23.733
Oh.

32:26.944 --> 32:27.862
{\an1}Hey.

32:27.945 --> 32:29.197
Hi.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.615
Sorry it took us so long.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.742
Yeah, but, um...

32:32.825 --> 32:34.619
we got it.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.706
Hmm.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.708
That-That's great, right?

32:40.792 --> 32:43.503
{\an1}This way I'll have more time
to enjoy with Matt.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.213
I was glad to do it.

32:45.296 --> 32:46.881
{\an3}Yeah, if there's
anything else

32:46.964 --> 32:49.509
we can do...

32:49.592 --> 32:50.885
No, I-I think that's it.

32:50.968 --> 32:52.428
{\an1}MATT:
Yeah.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.473
This is all I need.

33:15.868 --> 33:16.744
Hey.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.082
Hey.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.962
If it's any consolation,
I'm really proud of you.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.548
It's gonna be okay, Janet.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.599
I don't have
any clean underwear.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.934
{\an1}Excuse me?

33:40.017 --> 33:42.270
Here. I don't have any.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.438
Oh.

33:43.521 --> 33:46.274
So I have to go home.

33:46.357 --> 33:50.111
{\an1}Oh.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.613
{\an1}Well, maybe your father
won't be there.

33:52.697 --> 33:56.617
After spending
the whole night out with you?

33:56.701 --> 33:58.619
He'll be there.

33:58.703 --> 34:02.623
{\an1}You did
the right thing, Janet.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.835
It's gonna be okay.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.969
What you said--

34:16.053 --> 34:18.973
{\an3}that part after
the Three Stooges.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.433
That my mom's gay?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.353
That I love you.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.442
Well, if you want
to take it back,

34:29.525 --> 34:30.610
right now would be the time.

34:30.693 --> 34:33.780
I don't want to take it back.

34:33.862 --> 34:35.447
Are you sure?

34:35.531 --> 34:38.868
I'm sure.

34:38.951 --> 34:41.496
It's gonna be okay.

34:50.087 --> 34:52.465
{\an3}Gina, Gina.

34:52.547 --> 34:55.009
I'm late for work.

34:55.092 --> 34:58.304
Yeah, I just want
to say I'm sorry.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.388
{\an3}I shouldn't have
asked Dylan

34:59.472 --> 35:00.848
{\an3}to go down to Mexico
with me.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.811
We got the drugs.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.313
Oh.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.523
What, to kill the competition?

35:08.606 --> 35:11.692
I mean, what do you want me
to do say, "Congratulations"?

35:13.402 --> 35:15.154
Hi.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.532
Hey. I'm leaving.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.200
{\an1}Oh, I, uh, I was
just coming to see you.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.827
Sorry to disappoint you.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.332
She didn't look sorry.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.000
Are you going
to tell her what happened?

35:28.084 --> 35:31.420
No.

35:31.504 --> 35:32.588
You gonna tell Matt?

35:32.672 --> 35:35.258
I should, but no.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.020
You know how I was, uh, saying
that it was really nice

35:48.104 --> 35:49.730
to have something
to look forward to?

35:52.358 --> 35:53.359
It's nice, isn't it?

35:53.442 --> 35:59.031
I think it's enough to, uh, make
life worth living,

35:59.115 --> 36:00.616
no matter what.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.922
Are you sure
this is what you want?

36:15.006 --> 36:18.926
No.

36:20.052 --> 36:21.596
But it's what I'm gonna do.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.431
Okay, okay.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.640
Then-Then-Then
we'll move back to New York.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.100
I can get a job there.

36:26.183 --> 36:28.603
This way, I'll watch over
you as much as possible,

36:28.686 --> 36:31.105
and we'll go through this
together, okay?

36:31.188 --> 36:33.608
Really?

36:33.691 --> 36:35.735
Yeah.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.494
(upbeat rock and roll playing)

36:53.377 --> 36:55.296
{\an3}Hey.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.423
Hey.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.635
{\an3}YouI had...

37:00.718 --> 37:03.763
(both chuckle)

37:05.723 --> 37:06.766
Last night was nice.

37:06.849 --> 37:09.101
Yeah, it was really nice.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.980
I mean, considering the fact
it's been a while.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.608
Over a year.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.485
And the thing with Noah.

37:17.568 --> 37:21.989
Yeah, and-and you'd have to say
it went better than expected.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.866
Better than expected.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.952
Just what I was going for.

37:26.035 --> 37:26.953
You know what I mean.

37:27.036 --> 37:29.205
Yeah, I think I do.

37:29.288 --> 37:31.415
Listen, that stuff with Noah...

37:32.833 --> 37:35.378
I just have a lot
of things to work out.

37:35.461 --> 37:37.129
Yeah, I know.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.341
Donna...

37:40.424 --> 37:42.218
really, I know.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.851
You talk to your father?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.979
Mmm. Well, what did he say?

37:53.062 --> 37:55.231
(heavy sigh)

37:55.314 --> 37:57.566
He said that he respected
my decision.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.651
Well, that's good.

37:58.734 --> 38:01.028
And he wants me to respect his.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.154
{\an1}His?

38:02.238 --> 38:03.990
What do you mean his?
It's your life.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.242
Yeah, but it's his house.

38:07.743 --> 38:10.746
And as long as I'm with you, he
doesn't want me living in it.

38:10.830 --> 38:11.914
He threw you out?

38:11.998 --> 38:15.668
{\an3}Yeah, as soon as I told him
that we loved each other.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.878
I can't believe that.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.506
That's so wrong.

38:20.589 --> 38:21.757
I'm so sorry.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.113
You were right, you know.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.615
About me being a hypocrite.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.159
Yeah, well, you're in
pretty good company.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.036
Everyone else is, too.

38:50.119 --> 38:52.663
Well, I should have told you
what really happened with David,

38:52.747 --> 38:53.748
and I'm sorry about that.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.959
All right.
You can tell me now.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.586
Okay.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.755
The photographer,
he pushed us together

39:00.838 --> 39:01.672
and asked us to kiss.

39:01.756 --> 39:02.631
{\an1}You're gonna blame this
on a photographer?

39:02.715 --> 39:05.634
{\an3}No. But I am saying
that it was impulsive.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.595
Okay, it sounds pretty
meaningless.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.637
Is that the case?

39:08.721 --> 39:11.390
No, it isn't.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.102
All right, where does
this leave us?

39:15.186 --> 39:17.605
I don't know.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.613
(knocking on door)

39:25.696 --> 39:27.615
(turns off music)

39:30.201 --> 39:31.118
{\an1}Kelly, hi.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.119
Hi.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.287
Thanks for coming.

39:33.370 --> 39:34.163
Is everything okay?

39:34.246 --> 39:36.123
Your message said
it was important.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.294
I want you to know how much
I appreciate what you did.

39:40.377 --> 39:45.466
{\an1}You put yourself at risk
to get me medicine.

39:45.549 --> 39:48.302
{\an1}But, uh...
I'm not gonna take it.

39:48.385 --> 39:50.137
Well, won't you
get sick again?

39:50.221 --> 39:54.809
Yeah, in some ways,
I already am.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.936
{\an1}But, um...

39:57.019 --> 39:59.438
{\an1}you know, maybe someday,
they'll find a cure,

39:59.522 --> 40:01.649
{\an1}and when they do,
I want to be first in line.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.610
I hope that you are.

40:04.693 --> 40:08.989
Um... listen,
I don't have much time,

40:09.073 --> 40:12.159
{\an3}so I'm just gonna
be blunt, okay?

40:12.243 --> 40:15.788
{\an1}I, um... I want you
to do me another favor.

40:15.871 --> 40:18.332
Okay. Anything.

40:18.415 --> 40:20.501
Take care of Matt.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.169
{\an3}Lauren...

40:22.253 --> 40:23.963
Watch over him.
Make him happy.

40:24.046 --> 40:27.716
{\an3}You will be able to do
that soon enough.

40:27.800 --> 40:31.011
I see the way he looks at you,

40:31.095 --> 40:34.181
{\an1}the way he smiles
when you walk in a room,

40:34.265 --> 40:36.350
{\an1}and, and I know that
he loves you very much.

40:36.433 --> 40:38.561
He loves you, too.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.730
Will you do this
for me, please?

40:41.814 --> 40:43.816
(door opens)

40:43.899 --> 40:45.860
Hey.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.571
What's going on?

40:48.654 --> 40:50.030
Kelly?

40:51.407 --> 40:53.409
Course... I will.

40:58.539 --> 41:01.000
Will what?

41:01.083 --> 41:03.252
Take care of you when I'm gone.

41:03.335 --> 41:05.588
{\an3}What... but I'm
going, too. What...?

41:05.671 --> 41:08.340
You offered and that's...

41:08.424 --> 41:09.675
that's very sweet.

41:09.758 --> 41:12.178
But...
that's not what you want.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.596
Yes, it is.

41:13.679 --> 41:14.597
But it's not what I want.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.849
Come with me and help me

41:16.932 --> 41:20.019
get settled,
but then come back here, Matt.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.104
Move on with your life
with Kelly.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.316
Promise me that.

41:25.399 --> 41:26.275
Lauren, I...

41:26.358 --> 41:27.818
{\an1}Please?

41:29.236 --> 41:30.571
I can't.

41:35.367 --> 41:38.078
Then promise me
that you'll be happy.

41:50.841 --> 41:51.884
(door opens)

41:53.886 --> 41:55.471
{\an3}Hey.

41:55.554 --> 41:56.764
I'm really glad you're here.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.432
Hey.
Uh, what's going on?

41:58.515 --> 42:00.476
Did you find out the name
of the trustee?

42:00.559 --> 42:03.437
No, but my mom's in my room,

42:03.520 --> 42:05.773
so I'm gonna go ask her
right now.

42:05.856 --> 42:06.774
Want to come?

42:06.857 --> 42:08.234
Yeah.

42:08.317 --> 42:12.446
Well... this is gonna sound
kind of crazy,

42:12.529 --> 42:15.115
but I just need your support.

42:15.199 --> 42:19.119
You know, I'm, I'm really sorry
that you're going through this,

42:19.203 --> 42:21.288
but in a weird sort of way,

42:21.372 --> 42:23.457
I feel like this stuff
with your mom has

42:23.540 --> 42:25.000
kind of brought us together.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.919
{\an1}And I know
it's no consolation,

42:27.002 --> 42:29.755
but it feels a lot better.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.800
I'm glad you feel that way.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.635
{\an3}All right.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.470
Let's go find out
whose deep pockets

42:36.553 --> 42:37.638
{\an1}you're gonna be
digging into.

42:37.721 --> 42:38.973
Okay.

42:39.056 --> 42:39.640
{\an1}(laughs)
No.

42:39.723 --> 42:42.476
No, I don't.

42:42.559 --> 42:44.311
{\an1}Oh, I got
to call you back

42:44.395 --> 42:47.189
If you're here
to talk about the trust...

42:47.273 --> 42:48.774
{\an1}We're going to talk
about the trust.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.651
Calmly this time.

42:50.734 --> 42:53.487
Yeah, just...

42:53.570 --> 42:54.488
for one second, Mom,

42:54.571 --> 42:57.199
{\an1}I'm gonna forget everything
you've done to me

42:57.283 --> 42:59.868
{\an1}and I just want you to tell me
who the trustee is.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.161
No, you don't.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.329
Well, we've been told

43:02.413 --> 43:04.665
that the trustee is the person
who's legally responsible

43:04.748 --> 43:06.667
for how the money was spent.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.794
Yeah, the person who was
supposed to be looking out

43:08.877 --> 43:10.004
for my best interests.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.673
{\an6}I mean, I would really
love to know who
this genius is.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.008
Please, Gina,
don't ask me that.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.634
Mom, just tell me who it is.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.219
I don't understand.
I mean, either way,

43:17.303 --> 43:18.804
I'm gonna go after them
for pain and suffering.

43:18.887 --> 43:20.806
Please!

43:20.889 --> 43:22.850
Sorry, I just, I don't get it.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.226
Why are you protecting
this person?

43:27.813 --> 43:29.565
Because it's your mother.

43:29.648 --> 43:30.941
What?

43:31.025 --> 43:33.736
The trustee.

43:33.819 --> 43:36.697
The person that you're thinking
of suing to get your money back.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.032
It's Aunt Felice.
