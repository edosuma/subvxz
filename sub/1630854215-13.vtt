00:03.587 --> 00:07.758
Morning. Admissions percentage is out.
Top colleges have dropped to record lows.

00:07.758 --> 00:12.513
- Thinking about going back to school?
- No, I'm thinking about our son's future.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.641
As in starting a college fund
for the peanut?

00:15.641 --> 00:20.855
No, I put the peanut on a wait list
for prekindergarten at McClellan Hall.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.733
Isn't that a snobby private school
in Menlo Park?

00:23.733 --> 00:27.945
It is one of the top three feeder schools
for Stanford University.

00:27.945 --> 00:32.032
So you've decided he's going to college,
and picked out which one.

00:32.032 --> 00:37.121
Given our son's genetic makeup,
he will probably be very intelligent

00:37.121 --> 00:40.249
and will require
a challenging academic curriculum.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.501
Or he may not even enjoy academics.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.754
What he ends up doing will be his call.

00:44.754 --> 00:49.550
Whatever prekindergarten he ends up
attending will be our call, not his.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.765
No coffee. Glassy's still in his room?

00:56.015 --> 01:00.019
- I heard him leave at 6:14.
- He's been so sad about losing his house.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.271
How can you tell?

01:03.230 --> 01:07.026
- Have you noticed how quiet he's been?
- Yes, it's been nice.

01:07.943 --> 01:10.821
I guess he's just
throwing himself into his work.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.088
Dr. Murphy, little help here.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.221
Give tetanus booster, clean with betadine.

01:35.221 --> 01:37.515
- Administer--
- We got that. It's...

01:37.515 --> 01:39.141
We wanted a second opinion.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.476
Victor did.

01:40.810 --> 01:43.771
Yeah, before these young pups
take a saw to our son's foot,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.564
I'd like to talk to a supervisor.

01:45.564 --> 01:46.732
The nail's bent.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.484
I am their supervisor,

01:48.484 --> 01:52.279
and we need the saw
to cut the nail, not his foot.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.118
Are you good, Ricky?

02:14.343 --> 02:17.930
You all know my angel
for the past 11 years, Dr. Lim.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.891
Hey, Roses.
And this is my resident, Dr. Jordan Allen.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.309
Hi.

02:22.935 --> 02:26.105
-"Roses"?
- My website's called "More Than 65 Roses."

02:26.105 --> 02:29.191
It's what I called it
when I was diagnosed at five.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.819
Sixty-five roses. Cystic fibrosis.

02:31.986 --> 02:36.198
- Okay.
- And welcome to vlog number 458.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.284
Going out all around the world.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.621
- And what does DLT stand for?
- That would be double lung transplant.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.377
Your new lungs just arrived.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.026
I never should've agreed to let him go.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.904
You didn't. You just stopped
fighting with me about it.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.867
He's running a mild fever. 100.4.
Go where?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.828
Church camping trip,
less than an hour away.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.164
Camping can be very dangerous.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.582
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.335
I had my first fire-roasted s'more
last summer,

03:29.335 --> 03:31.295
so it can also be very fun.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.088
Thank you, Dr. Wolke.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.591
Be careful, please.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.593
Victor, he's a doctor.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.471
- Just try to trust--
- Trust that things will work out.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.764
Yep. I know.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.518
You're a Warriors fan?
You like Steph Curry?

03:47.269 --> 03:50.397
- I like Draymond.
- A rebel. I like it.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.111
Look at this beast.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.074
Nice job, Ricky.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.292
His temperature just jumped two degrees.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.586
Get a CBC, blood cultures
and CT of his foot

04:12.586 --> 04:15.422
to check for damage
to the bones and muscles.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.933
Dr. Park. How kind of you to join me.

04:26.684 --> 04:27.726
You paged me.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.604
Have a seat.
And, yes, they're Herman Miller.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.149
The cappuccino, mochaccino,
expresso, latte...

04:34.525 --> 04:35.943
None of those are for you.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.655
Okay, I was wrong.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.032
This is the perfect job for you.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.535
Your first study has what, 800 patients?

04:44.868 --> 04:49.206
But since you've had four whole days
to hire all the clinical trial nurses,

04:49.206 --> 04:50.708
it should be easy.

04:52.376 --> 04:55.254
I may be a little behind,
may have 13 patients waiting,

04:55.254 --> 04:56.338
but I will handle it.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.923
With a lot of cappuccinos.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.801
Thanks for your support.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.722
Do you want me to give you a hand?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.391
I have 90 minutes before my next surgery.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.478
In exchange for unlimited use
of your espresso machine.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.314
We'll see.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.369
Poor Ricky.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.080
He probably just has a minor infection.

05:30.706 --> 05:31.915
I meant the parents.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.419
Two very different schools of thought
on child-rearing.

05:35.419 --> 05:38.464
It's hard on the marriage,
but harder on the kid.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.842
Everyone has different opinions,
Dr. Wolke.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.803
Which they need to sort out
before having kids.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.141
My college roommate, Jewish,
married a Catholic woman.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.143
They had three children quickly.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.896
Started fighting about parenting nonstop.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.983
My parents never fought about us.
My dad didn't care.

05:57.983 --> 06:01.987
As long as Mom got me and my brother
dressed and out in time for chores.

06:05.282 --> 06:09.036
No hematoma or abscess.
No explanation for the fever.

06:09.787 --> 06:10.788
My neck.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.623
It really hurts.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.875
Okay.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.548
Hey, I got you.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.888
He has tick bites on his back.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.897
Pink, plump and spongy.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.650
What's that?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.155
Pneumonia?

06:46.156 --> 06:47.199
In both lungs.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.423
She's lucky if she has another week.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.637
Ex vivo lung profusion.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.265
Maybe we can make the lungs
heal themselves.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.519
That's usually used in cases
involving pulmonary edema.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.275
Get the lungs.
Meet me in the procedure room.

07:25.696 --> 07:26.613
Tick bites?

07:26.613 --> 07:30.117
His fever, vomiting and sore neck
could be neurological.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.410
It's in his brain?

07:31.410 --> 07:33.912
Possibly. The blood tests
were inconclusive,

07:33.912 --> 07:37.166
so we'd like to do a lumbar puncture
to check Ricky's CSF.

07:37.166 --> 07:40.002
This camp just keeps
getting better and better.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.795
Can we not do this right now?

07:41.795 --> 07:45.549
- I want this to never happen again.
- And I don't?

07:45.549 --> 07:47.843
I care about our son as much as you.

07:47.843 --> 07:51.013
And yet you keep prioritizing fun
over safety.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.056
Yes, I care about fun.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.517
And socialization, self-esteem,
self-expression--

07:55.517 --> 07:58.228
None of which are as important
as his safety.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.398
I can't do this anymore.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.667
After six, only one with a minor reaction.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.085
- You?
- Me too.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.713
So we are 12 down, one to go.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.508
Mr. Riggs?

08:28.759 --> 08:30.052
Mr. Riggs?

08:34.431 --> 08:35.307
Sorry.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.934
I just drifted off.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.187
My fault for keeping you waiting so long.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.650
So, how are you feeling, aside from tired?

08:44.983 --> 08:46.026
Just a bit achy,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.613
especially my knees and elbows, hips.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.740
And some mild jaundice.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.618
Other than that, I feel pretty good.

09:00.916 --> 09:04.795
Hello. We should sort out our differences
about child-raising.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.256
If this is about McClellan Hall,
not a big deal.

09:07.256 --> 09:10.217
I've made a list
of 37 other potential differences.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.804
I'd love to discuss them,
but Andrews just approved new EMR software

09:13.804 --> 09:17.057
and wants me to run a beta test on it
in the next 24 hours.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.642
- Have you talked to Glassy?
- No.

09:18.642 --> 09:23.230
He didn't come to work today,
but I got a text. He says that he is okay.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.189
Where is he?

10:08.734 --> 10:09.860
<i>It is not over yet.</i>

10:10.402 --> 10:13.655
Lungs are remarkably resilient organs

10:14.197 --> 10:15.615
when they are in a body.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.328
Which is why we have to convince them
they still are.

10:19.494 --> 10:23.623
<i>We give them a blood supply
by hooking them up to a profusion machine,</i>

10:23.623 --> 10:27.252
<i>an air supply
by hooking them up to a ventilator,</i>

10:27.252 --> 10:29.546
<i>IV drips to feed them antibiotics,</i>

10:29.546 --> 10:32.674
<i>and we might be able
to con them back into viability.</i>

10:32.799 --> 10:34.593
The next six hours are crucial.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.846
How will you know if they're viable?

10:38.055 --> 10:41.058
Our main indicator
is a calculation called the P/F ratio.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.061
<i>When that reaches
at least 400 mm of mercury...</i>

10:44.186 --> 10:45.812
those lungs are good to go.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.733
Mom, relax.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.151
It's Dr. L.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.253
Palpate to find the L3-4 interspace.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.799
Maybe Lea and I won't be able
to sort out our differences

11:13.799 --> 11:16.927
about child-raising and become angry
like Victor and Shelly.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.763
You and Lea
are nothing like Victor and Shelly.

11:19.763 --> 11:23.892
They're from completely different worlds,
have vastly different outlooks.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.437
Lea and I are very different too.
Insert the spinal needle.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.731
Who knows if they love each other.

11:29.731 --> 11:33.985
You and Lea, I know you do, a lot,
and that's all that matters.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.738
At least according
to the Hallmark Channel.

11:37.572 --> 11:38.782
I'm in.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.457
The infection has elevated
his intracranial pressure.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.584
Intubate and load him with levetiracetam

11:49.584 --> 11:51.795
and dexamethasone
before his brain herniates.

12:00.637 --> 12:03.849
CSF confirming a very rare infection
called <i>naegleria fowleri.</i>

12:03.849 --> 12:07.060
It's a brain-eating amoeba
that's caused cerebral swelling.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.729
We need to put Ricky
in a barbiturate-induced coma

12:09.729 --> 12:12.941
and surgically place a port
into the center of his brain.

12:12.941 --> 12:16.695
Then we will flood it with antibiotics,
which should reduce the edema.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.613
And he contracted this from a tick?

12:18.613 --> 12:22.117
No, it's contracted via contaminated water
through the nose.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.953
So he got it from
the swimming hole at camp.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.288
That's a good guess.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.416
Ricky's too anxious around water
to put his head under,

12:29.416 --> 12:31.460
let alone get water up his nose.

12:31.877 --> 12:35.172
<i>Naegleria fowleri</i> has also been found
in untreated swimming pools,

12:35.172 --> 12:37.549
- nasal rinses, water heaters--
- Nasal rinses?

12:38.508 --> 12:40.343
If unboiled tap water is used.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.307
I gave him a nasal rinse
the morning he left for camp.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.476
He had a runny nose.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.562
That is a better guess.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.028
Excuse me.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.414
Riggs has fatigue, joint pain,
impaired mental acuity,

13:09.414 --> 13:12.125
tachycardia and mild liver failure.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.920
- Thanks.
- Maybe he has a pre-existing condition.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.463
He should have been eliminated

13:16.463 --> 13:18.673
by any remotely competent
screening process.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.510
Those protocols were in place
before you came on board.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.721
I'll remind the CRO of that
when I tell them, on my first day,

13:24.721 --> 13:27.182
that their $4 million trial
needs to be trashed.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.602
Save the doomsday predictions
until after the blood panel results.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.855
Lab's on the way to the OR.

13:39.694 --> 13:43.114
- It hasn't been six hours yet, has it?
- Six and a quarter.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.018
You want company?

14:15.021 --> 14:15.981
Thanks.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.959
Hello. Where is Victor?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.379
Beating himself up somewhere.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.382
I just...

14:43.258 --> 14:44.926
wish that made a difference.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.179
Do you love each other?

14:52.017 --> 14:53.059
Yeah.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.103
Of course.

14:55.770 --> 15:00.150
We've always been oil and water.
That's how my dad describes us.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.486
Victor grew up in Belgrade.
I grew up in Berkeley.

15:03.945 --> 15:07.532
Different religions and politics,
socio-economic status.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.452
But when I got pregnant,

15:10.452 --> 15:13.622
we knew we had
a lot of issues to work out.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.290
And we did.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.543
Then Ricky was born and...

15:20.837 --> 15:23.089
we suddenly started arguing over...

15:23.882 --> 15:25.634
When can he safely eat tree nuts?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.928
How high should he climb
on the jungle gym?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.847
When can he stay with a babysitter?

15:31.306 --> 15:35.310
Those little things were the ones
we could never work out.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.772
But, yes, we still love each other.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.440
It's just that...

15:41.858 --> 15:43.985
I'm not sure love is enough anymore.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.240
Still waiting.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.242
Still hoping.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.246
That's kind of what we do,
isn't it, Roses?

15:57.916 --> 15:59.668
And the wait is over.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.515
I'm sorry.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.314
We've put you back on the list.

16:23.525 --> 16:24.901
You're at the very top.

16:29.739 --> 16:30.949
I deserved this.

16:33.535 --> 16:34.953
I wanted those lungs.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.207
I wanted someone to die.

16:39.833 --> 16:40.875
Brecca.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.434
Honey, should we finish?

16:59.894 --> 17:00.979
No.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.830
Hello, Dr. Glassman.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.334
Shaun.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.129
You might try knocking next time,

17:26.129 --> 17:28.631
although, you know,
it might be a little tough.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.806
- What are you looking for?
- You know...

17:38.057 --> 17:39.100
My life.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.228
Just my life.

17:59.662 --> 18:00.705
Not yet.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.583
I think I'm gonna keep at it for a bit.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.382
- Okay.
- No, this is on me. You can head home.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.594
Thanks.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.564
I will miss your big screen LED TV.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.944
It was old
and had a pixel line down the right side.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.321
Did you love Alana?

18:34.531 --> 18:35.532
What?

18:36.324 --> 18:38.368
Did I love Alana? Yeah, of course.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.745
Did you love Debbie?

18:42.622 --> 18:45.291
Yeah. I loved Debbie.
Where is this going, Shaun?

18:45.291 --> 18:48.545
That wasn't enough
for you to get over your differences.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.714
How do I know if love will be enough

18:51.714 --> 18:54.384
for me and Lea
to get over our differences?

18:54.384 --> 18:55.885
You won't know.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.054
I mean, how can you know? You can't know.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.225
I do not like worrying about this.

19:02.225 --> 19:05.854
I mean, Lea had some doubts
just a little while ago.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.689
- You both got over that.
- Yes.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.900
- Because I was very supportive.
- There you go.

19:11.025 --> 19:15.488
But differences about child-raising
seem to be bigger than normal differences.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.616
Yeah. Having a child,
I mean, that's big, that's huge.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.744
It's a shift. It shifts everything.
Marriage, everything.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.414
I do not want a shift in our marriage.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.791
Maybe it'll shift for the better.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.967
Ardie's eye.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.971
First thing I ever bought Maddie
was a stuffed aardvark.

19:46.144 --> 19:49.230
Back in the day,
I performed a 21-hour surgery.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.109
I removed an astrocytoma
from the medulla of the brain stem.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.028
It was heroic, it put me on the map.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.530
My elective surgeries
were booked out for a year.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.575
I was in a zone,
like playing scratch golf.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.912
And then Ilana got pregnant.

20:06.289 --> 20:09.667
She didn't want to stop work.
Had a real estate thing, doing well.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.378
I didn't want to stop.
I wanted to stay on the map.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.507
And then we brought Maddie home
that first night.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.303
Everything changed.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.102
Go talk to Lea.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.104
I tried.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.567
She had to run a beta test
on new EMR software.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.695
Then you'll have to wait until she's done.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.308
All I had on my DVR was
a marathon of <i>Shark Tank.</i>

21:07.308 --> 21:10.728
Can't say I was in the mood to be staring
at Mr. Wonderful's bald head.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.983
So why not entertain myself by watching
some hot line perfusion action?

21:15.984 --> 21:17.527
I'm not one to kink shame.

21:17.735 --> 21:20.279
Coffee and cronuts, from Chaz's bakery.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.198
I'm happy for the company.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.701
Pneumi is not much of a conversationalist.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.203
- Pneumi?
- My pet name for them.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.414
From the Greek word for lungs, <i>pneumonas.</i>

21:29.414 --> 21:31.582
I thought it was better than "Lungy."

21:31.582 --> 21:33.334
Yeah, I may be losing it.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.419
Cronut.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.009
- Any progress?
- Negligible.

21:41.843 --> 21:46.055
I keep doing the same thing over and over,
hoping for a different outcome.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.016
Yeah, I'm definitely losing it.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.268
Then do something different.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.444
Okay.

22:06.993 --> 22:10.288
Doubling up on antibiotics,
and we can add steroids.

22:10.288 --> 22:15.251
This will either hammer out
the infection or the lungs.

22:24.927 --> 22:28.681
- How's Glassy?
- Very sore and very sooty.

22:35.063 --> 22:39.192
- We need to talk--
- About our 37 differences?

22:39.192 --> 22:40.610
I thought of two more.

22:42.403 --> 22:45.114
Shaun, as you know,
I'm kind of busy right now,

22:45.239 --> 22:47.658
so you'll have to settle for me
agreeing that, yes,

22:47.658 --> 22:49.118
we'll have many differences.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.788
But in time,
we'll be able to work them out.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.831
That's what Victor and Shelly thought.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.292
And now they are talking about separating.

22:56.918 --> 22:59.253
I don't know who Victor and Shelly are.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.549
In any event, I have at least
two more hours of work to do.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.427
Okay.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.396
You're waiting, aren't you?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.190
Yes, I am very patient.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.860
You are very patient
and very understanding.

23:22.985 --> 23:25.321
And you were so good with me
on our babymoon.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.865
If you could just channel some of that...

23:27.865 --> 23:30.493
On our babymoon,
I thought love was enough.

23:34.247 --> 23:39.669
That's kind of a big thing
to drop on me this late at night.

23:39.794 --> 23:42.421
You were too busy
to discuss it in the morning.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.298
So I talked to Dr. Glassman about it,

23:44.298 --> 23:47.552
and he said having a child
will shift our dynamics.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.929
If it does, we can talk about it then.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.641
If we can't talk about our dynamics now,
how about our differences?

23:53.641 --> 23:54.725
Really? We have 39,

23:54.725 --> 23:57.395
so we need serious time,
and I'm sure they'll keep

23:57.395 --> 24:00.273
because we're kind of committed
to having a kid together,

24:00.273 --> 24:02.150
whether love is enough or not.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.361
Shaun, I'm way too tired

24:05.361 --> 24:09.198
to have a productive conversation
about this right now.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.701
- Okay?
- Okay.

24:41.272 --> 24:42.690
It's time to call it.

24:45.776 --> 24:49.238
I had half an hour left on my call
when she first came into the ER.

24:49.864 --> 24:51.991
Coughing blood, vitals on the floor.

24:53.451 --> 24:54.660
When we opened her up,

24:54.660 --> 24:57.038
her lungs looked like a 70-year-old's.

24:57.038 --> 24:59.582
Didn't think she'd make it
through the night.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.625
She was eight.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.590
I couldn't go home.
And stayed with her that night.

25:09.217 --> 25:13.012
And then the next morning,
she just opened her eyes,

25:13.012 --> 25:16.057
looked at me and told me
she liked my French braid.

25:19.894 --> 25:21.229
Once I call it,

25:23.272 --> 25:25.775
I have to go up there and tell her
I failed her.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.953
Got Riggs' latest test results.

25:36.953 --> 25:39.789
Turns out he did have
a pre-existing condition.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.040
Hemochromatosis.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.501
So the jerk lied about it
to get into the study?

25:45.127 --> 25:48.589
- That's the assumption?
- He got 3,500 bucks to participate.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.968
I think it's a pretty sound assumption,
but whether he lied or not,

25:51.968 --> 25:54.220
it means the screeners are incompetent.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.055
That's got to take a toll.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.140
Expecting the worst of everybody.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.227
I'd rather be pleasantly surprised
than bitterly disappointed.

26:02.478 --> 26:06.107
And that's the world view you want
to impart to your future child?

26:07.566 --> 26:09.318
Assume the worst of everyone?

26:18.494 --> 26:20.496
Help. We need help in here.

26:22.290 --> 26:25.584
- What's happening?
- Add a milligram of lorazepam.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.129
- He's seizing.
- Because his ICPs are in the 40s.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.964
Cerebral edema's gotten worse.

26:29.964 --> 26:32.967
If we don't open Ricky's skull
immediately, he will die.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.477
Removing hemicranial skull flap.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.355
Performing wide dural opening.

26:51.819 --> 26:54.697
Look at the monitor.
EEG's all over the place.

26:54.697 --> 26:55.990
He's still seizing.

26:55.990 --> 26:59.785
Place an additional EVD and increase
propofol to burst suppress.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.162
But he's maxed out.

27:01.162 --> 27:03.080
Giving more propofol could kill him.

27:03.372 --> 27:06.417
If we don't,
the seizures will definitely kill him.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.460
Okay.

27:14.216 --> 27:17.470
We can remove the damaged cortex
in the left anterior temporal lobe,

27:17.470 --> 27:20.139
using pre-op imaging to guide us.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.433
Cut out part of his brain? That's extreme.

27:22.850 --> 27:25.186
That is the area
that's causing the seizures.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.647
- Might be a tough sell to his parents.
- Which is why you will help.

27:29.106 --> 27:32.651
Okay. Please keep him stabilized
with eyes to the cortical surface.

27:39.450 --> 27:40.826
"The country flew past,

27:40.826 --> 27:44.580
as if they were seeing it
from the windows of an express train.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.916
Faster and faster they raced,

27:48.042 --> 27:50.461
but no one got tired or out of breath."

27:53.130 --> 27:55.549
We can save the last chapter for later.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.303
There is no later.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.189
Where's Dr. L?

28:12.525 --> 28:15.069
She wasn't ready to give up on your lungs.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.488
There's still a chance?

28:20.825 --> 28:22.159
Dr. Lim thinks so.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.125
Let's finish.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.098
Chapter 16.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.894
"Farewell to the Shadowlands."

28:50.438 --> 28:52.648
We'd cut out a small piece of his cortex.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.525
It's already damaged by infection.

28:54.525 --> 28:58.362
Removing it may be
the only way to keep him alive.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.740
But how would that affect him?

29:01.866 --> 29:06.203
There are areas of the brain that are
significantly less essential than others.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.039
This part only impacts
his speech and memory.

29:09.039 --> 29:10.833
Probably not long-term.

29:11.459 --> 29:15.963
So he might not be able to talk
or know who we are?

29:15.963 --> 29:19.091
We wouldn't be able to fully assess him
until he wakes up.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.061
Ricky's skull is opened.

29:36.650 --> 29:37.943
We should do it.

29:40.154 --> 29:42.364
This is a very good hospital.

29:42.490 --> 29:44.283
These are very smart doctors.

29:45.743 --> 29:48.204
And someone very wise once told me that

29:49.914 --> 29:52.708
sometimes you just have to trust
things will work out.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.132
Okay.

30:26.784 --> 30:27.910
<i>Hemochromatosis?</i>

30:28.077 --> 30:30.204
You never noticed
these symptoms until now?

30:30.204 --> 30:32.540
Joint pain, fatigue, mental fuzziness?

30:32.540 --> 30:34.166
I turn 58 next week.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.627
I haven't felt a day over 30 until now.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.758
It's very unlikely your hemochromatosis

30:42.758 --> 30:44.718
went from zero to 60 in a week.

30:47.471 --> 30:50.891
Is it possible you gave the screener
someone else's blood?

30:52.101 --> 30:54.311
You think I cheated? For the money?

30:54.311 --> 30:56.355
No, Mr. Riggs. I'm just trying to--

30:59.817 --> 31:02.069
You're a blood donor
in the 20 gallon club?

31:02.194 --> 31:04.572
Yeah. Regular donor the last 30 years.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.615
When was the last time you donated?

31:06.740 --> 31:09.243
Two months ago,
just before I started this trial.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.288
And you're not allowed to donate
while you're in the trial.

31:12.288 --> 31:13.872
See, that's the downside.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.541
I actually enjoy those cookies.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.170
I'll make sure you get
all the cookies you want.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.058
Don't you think it's time to come home?

31:34.226 --> 31:35.144
No.

31:37.896 --> 31:42.651
In that case, I wanted to make you
something delicious like you've made us,

31:42.651 --> 31:46.113
but I'm not a very good cook
and everything's closed,

31:46.113 --> 31:48.741
so I hope you like

31:48.741 --> 31:53.537
hot-dog-flavored potato chips
and Nutty Buddys.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.249
Yeah.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.297
- Nail polish?
- Father-daughter time.

32:04.298 --> 32:08.510
Maddie insisted that she paint
my fingernails a sparkly rainbow color.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.351
And the next day, my first patient
was very uncomfortable.

32:15.351 --> 32:18.729
That's when I realized I forgot
to remove the nail polish.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.523
That's a nice memory.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.027
Sit. No, sit, sit, sit.

32:32.785 --> 32:33.827
So many memories.

32:36.038 --> 32:38.624
That Halloween Maddie
wanted to go as a ham

32:38.624 --> 32:41.418
because we had just seen
<i>To Kill A Mockingbird.</i>

32:41.543 --> 32:44.713
But she wanted the ham

32:44.713 --> 32:46.882
to be made out of an actual ham.

32:48.175 --> 32:52.137
And then one night the wind was blowing
so hard it blew her bedroom door shut.

32:53.013 --> 32:56.892
She was convinced that her grandmother's
ghost had come back to visit her.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.771
Wanted to sleep in our bed
for the next two weeks.

33:04.858 --> 33:08.278
You didn't come here
just to feed me junk food, did you?

33:09.780 --> 33:12.116
I thought you might need
someone to talk to.

33:12.241 --> 33:13.534
I'm fine.

33:16.245 --> 33:17.913
I know someone you should talk to.

33:23.419 --> 33:26.672
I know. But this was easier.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.185
"Hot dog" should not be a flavor.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.734
"All their life in this world
and all their adventures in Narnia

33:46.734 --> 33:49.361
had only been the cover on the title page.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.448
Now, at last,
they were beginning chapter one

33:52.448 --> 33:56.785
of the great story
which no one on Earth has read,

33:58.078 --> 33:59.580
which goes on forever,

34:01.540 --> 34:03.250
in which every chapter

34:04.084 --> 34:06.044
is better than the one before."

34:11.884 --> 34:14.303
Checking in. Need me to up your morphine?

34:15.345 --> 34:16.263
Couldn't hurt.

34:27.524 --> 34:30.194
Hey, I changed my mind

34:31.361 --> 34:32.988
about the vlog.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.699
Wonderful.

34:45.334 --> 34:46.794
Go for it.

34:50.923 --> 34:55.093
Hey, Roses. I'm back.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.932
The DLT didn't really work out,

34:59.932 --> 35:05.562
so this is gonna be my last update.

35:07.856 --> 35:12.236
I wasn't even going to do this,
I was gonna flip off Dylan Thomas

35:12.236 --> 35:14.780
and go gently into that good night.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.741
But...

35:19.076 --> 35:21.328
I couldn't leave without saying goodbye.

35:23.163 --> 35:26.875
And that it's okay to be hurt.

35:28.544 --> 35:29.461
I am.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.006
That my life's been cut short.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.511
But the upside to all of this

35:39.096 --> 35:42.015
is that I feel something
I never thought I would.

35:42.516 --> 35:43.767
It's gratitude.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.731
I'm grateful to my sweet mother.

35:52.025 --> 35:52.943
And...

35:55.028 --> 35:58.198
to the people who keep hope alive.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.245
<i>Like Dr. L, and...</i>

36:10.419 --> 36:11.420
Crash cart.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.506
She's in full respiratory failure.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.801
- We need to intubate her.
- No.

36:20.470 --> 36:21.805
We need to let her go.

37:12.022 --> 37:14.858
Pneumi hit 402. Get Brecca to the OR.

37:16.860 --> 37:20.322
The lungs are good. We should intubate.

37:21.490 --> 37:22.574
Yes.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.844
- Ricky?
- Dr. Murphy.

37:44.972 --> 37:47.891
Ricky? Can you hear us?

37:50.352 --> 37:51.269
Hello.

37:56.066 --> 37:58.777
Do you know where you are?

38:04.074 --> 38:06.535
Do you know your name?

38:22.592 --> 38:25.762
I'm Ricky Pavlovich.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.639
I'm in the hospital

38:27.639 --> 38:32.519
because I stepped
on a rusty nail at church camp.

38:35.856 --> 38:38.775
But I would still like
to go back there next year.

39:10.474 --> 39:11.725
Welcome home, Pneumi.

39:20.275 --> 39:21.902
Riggs is a lifelong blood donor.

39:23.528 --> 39:27.532
- Which totally eliminated his symptoms.
- Until he started this trial.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.701
He's not allowed to donate till it's over.

39:29.701 --> 39:33.288
So there was nothing wrong with
the protocols. Nobody was incompetent.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.665
And Riggs isn't a big, fat liar.

39:35.665 --> 39:38.460
In fact, he's a legit hero.

39:40.921 --> 39:43.340
Maybe my world view
does need a little adjustment.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.843
I prefer Italian roast.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.386
Noted.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.727
Ready to take Pneumi for a test run?

39:58.230 --> 39:59.940
That's what she named your lungs.

40:00.857 --> 40:01.858
It was a weird night.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.614
Start small.

41:03.336 --> 41:04.421
Thanks for coming.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.257
We should talk.

41:23.356 --> 41:28.153
Number 39, dietary restrictions.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.615
Other than breast milk.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.493
I felt a kick!

41:41.416 --> 41:42.375
I felt...

41:43.627 --> 41:44.961
This is very exciting.

41:47.964 --> 41:48.882
Come here.

41:54.763 --> 41:56.765
Think of all of the new memories

41:57.891 --> 41:59.100
waiting to be made.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.316
Hey. Let's go home.

42:10.445 --> 42:13.698
Number 39, other than breast milk,

42:13.698 --> 42:18.161
I don't think that peanut should have
any dairy products before six months.

42:18.161 --> 42:19.621
Easy-peasy.

42:19.621 --> 42:20.997
Number 38?
