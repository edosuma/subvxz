I'll take a picture.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.960
That's me.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.560
Anything else you need?

25:18.880 --> 25:20.960
-We're good.
-Thank you.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.480
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.160
-Thank you.
-Let's eat.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.720
It looks so good.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.960
Right. I think it was a young man.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.640
What? Didn't you see him?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.600
I can't remember his face.

25:38.400 --> 25:42.360
Yu-mi. How can you not remember his face?
It was legendary.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.840
I was busy taking a picture.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.800
If he was that handsome,
you should've told me.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.440
He came by many times.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.320
He got us water and side dishes.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.240
Did he? Why didn't I notice?

25:53.160 --> 25:54.840
I guess I was busy eating.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.360
I was so hungry because I had
marathon practice in the morning.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.560
[No.]

26:00.640 --> 26:02.960
[It's not that she was busy eating.]

26:03.760 --> 26:07.040
[It's because the male reconnaissance
squad isn't working lately.]

26:08.040 --> 26:10.200
[They always keep eyes forward]

26:10.280 --> 26:12.440
[for a decent man.]

26:14.600 --> 26:17.080
Yu-mi's type found at 5 o' clock.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.760
-Where?
-Where?

26:19.120 --> 26:21.360
[Yu-mi. Turn your head to 5 o' clock.]

26:33.400 --> 26:35.720
Yeonnam-dong please.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.320
[Yu-mi. To your right.
On the right side view mirror.]

26:43.240 --> 26:46.040
[Their main job is to find Yu-mi's type.]

26:49.960 --> 26:53.760
Now that Yu-mi's got a boyfriend,
we'll go take a break.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.880
She wouldn't need us for a while.

26:55.960 --> 26:58.400
Sure. When do you plan to return?

26:58.880 --> 27:00.480
When Yu-mi's lonely again.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.000
-Have a good time.
-Have a good time.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.280
-Aloha.
-Aloha.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.320
Woong.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.560
Yu-mi.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.640
You're early.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.440
Yu-mi!

27:31.680 --> 27:33.600
-Are you okay?
-It hurts.

27:33.840 --> 27:34.840
Let me see.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.440
You fall often.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.680
You should be more careful.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.600
What's wrong?

27:53.280 --> 27:54.360
Does it still hurt?

27:55.840 --> 27:58.480
Woong. Do you want fried chicken?

28:00.200 --> 28:02.280
No, is pizza better?

28:03.240 --> 28:06.600
No, let's get fried chicken.
I know a real good place nearby.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.800
No, wait a minute. Pizza?

28:10.880 --> 28:13.160
Let's get both.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.040
Woong.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.520
What is it again?

28:18.520 --> 28:20.360
My heart just fluttered.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.000
Then let's have
both fried chicken and pizza.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.400
Did you order something?

28:31.160 --> 28:32.360
I think it's the package.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.160
Package?

28:37.600 --> 28:39.400
It's matching shirts.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.760
Yes, I bought them
while looking for sweatsuits.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.520
I thought we can wear them
and exercise together.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.520
Yellow is mine.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.440
Blue is yours.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.480
Let me see.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.520
-It's cute.
-I know, right?

29:03.840 --> 29:04.920
You should try it on.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.520
-Now?
-Yes.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.880
To see if it fits.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.480
If it doesn't, I should return it.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.640
Sure.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.240
You have a mole on your back.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.320
On my back?
I don't have a mole on my back.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.240
You do. Right here.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.000
Where?

29:38.360 --> 29:39.440
Here.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.160
Yes. Who is it?

29:48.560 --> 29:50.480
Who was that?

29:55.040 --> 29:56.600
It's right here. The mole.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.920
-Fried chicken...
-What?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.320
Can you order it later?

30:04.960 --> 30:07.080
Should I order pizza first?

30:07.280 --> 30:08.320
No.

30:29.480 --> 30:30.680
Enjoy exercising.

30:57.920 --> 30:58.760
[Let's go.]

31:00.720 --> 31:04.040
[The reconnaissance squad's long vacation
won't end anytime soon.]

31:04.760 --> 31:06.320
[-Meanwhile in the village,]
-Let's go!

31:06.400 --> 31:08.360
[Yu-mi's Guard is back.]

31:22.720 --> 31:23.760
Excuse me.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.800
-What? Who's this punk?
-Who is he?

31:34.200 --> 31:35.240
Me?

31:35.680 --> 31:37.800
Yes. Aren't you

31:38.760 --> 31:40.440
Kim Yu-mi?

31:41.560 --> 31:43.320
Who is he? Do you know who this guy is?

31:43.400 --> 31:45.040
-No.
-You don't know him?

31:46.960 --> 31:49.480
If a guy she doesn't know stopped her
and said, "Excuse me,"

31:49.560 --> 31:51.080
I must step in.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.280
This is an order.
Lock the Gates of the Heart at once.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.360
All cells, be on red alert!

32:03.040 --> 32:04.280
-On red alert!
-On red alert!

32:05.600 --> 32:07.480
Who knows? He may ask her for her number--

32:07.560 --> 32:10.120
-What? What is it?
-Guard! Wait!

32:12.960 --> 32:14.200
Calm down.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.160
First, let's see if he's on the list
of the men she knows.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.680
It's rude if she doesn't recognize
someone she knows.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.320
Right, that would be awkward too.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.680
Hold on. Does Yu-mi know this many guys?

32:28.640 --> 32:30.480
No, this isn't it.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.360
Here's the list.

32:35.280 --> 32:39.200
[Who?]

32:39.720 --> 32:41.720
[He's not here. He's a new face.]

32:41.800 --> 32:43.080
[He's not on the list.]

32:43.920 --> 32:46.520
How do you know my name?

32:46.920 --> 32:48.560
You're Assistant Manager Kim Yu-mi, right?

32:49.280 --> 32:51.640
Hello,
I'm Assistant Marketing Manager Yoo Bobby.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.920
Hello.

32:56.320 --> 32:59.160
I thought you looked so familiar
every time I saw you, and I was right.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.440
The other day, I asked you for directions.

33:04.560 --> 33:05.640
Well...

33:07.120 --> 33:08.440
Did you?

33:08.960 --> 33:10.040
Yes.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.680
Anyway, it's nice to have a co-worker
who lives in my neighborhood.

Right, yes.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.200
Okay, see you.

Wait, by any chance...

33:30.000 --> 33:31.040
Yes?

33:31.440 --> 33:34.600
I knew it. You punk, you're dead meat!

33:36.560 --> 33:37.720
By any chance...

33:42.360 --> 33:43.960
What? What do you want?

33:44.040 --> 33:46.280
Are you trying to enter Yu-mi's heart?

33:46.360 --> 33:48.560
Not a chance, as long as I'm alive!

33:48.720 --> 33:52.600
Hey, sorry to disappoint you.
But Yu-mi has a boyfriend!

33:56.080 --> 33:57.080
Yes.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.080
Didn't you lose your umbrella?

34:01.880 --> 34:04.280
-Sorry?
-It looks like a fried egg.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.480
Yes! My gosh, it's mine.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.960
The fried egg umbrella! Yes, it's mine.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.080
We found the umbrella.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.400
Thank goodness we found it.
That umbrella was expensive!

34:15.480 --> 34:17.639
That's great, Cheapskate.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.080
Hey, Guard. You can put your gun down.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.880
Even so, we must not let our guard down.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.639
"I found your umbrella,
so buy me a cup of coffee."

34:26.719 --> 34:28.440
What if he says that?

34:28.960 --> 34:30.760
You're so dead.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.520
What's he saying?

34:33.840 --> 34:35.920
I thought I had lost it and just gave up.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.040
My gosh, thank goodness.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.480
I found it in the lobby,
and it's in my office now.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.159
I'll drop it off at Accounting tomorrow.

34:42.239 --> 34:45.239
No, it's okay.
I'll stop by the marketing department.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.840
Your name is written on the handle.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.520
Yes, that's right.

but my girlfriend saw it and told me.

He has a girlfriend.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.200
Hey, he has a girlfriend.
Are you going to keep going?

35:04.720 --> 35:06.000
If that's the case...

from the Jeju branch last week?

36:52.760 --> 36:55.480
I see. He transferred
from the Jeju branch.

No wonder I didn't recognize him.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.520
It's usually crowded during the day.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.520
On weekends,
I'm always here in the morning.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.040
["On weekends,
it's nicer here in the morning."]

40:26.720 --> 40:29.400
[Just to give a decent reason?
Or to tell her when he'll be here next?]

40:28.120 --> 40:29.800
[His schedule? Just a decent reason?]

40:30.840 --> 40:33.760
[Just to give her some helpful info
as her neighbor?]

40:33.560 --> 40:35.600
["It's usually crowded during the day."]

40:33.960 --> 40:37.480
[Or did he want to tell her
when he's usually there on weekends?]

40:37.760 --> 40:40.160
Does he have feelings for her or not?

40:41.960 --> 40:44.920
From his attitude alone,
I can't tell whether or not

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
she can let her guard down.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.560
Hello.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.960
Oh, hello.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.200
Do you have to work this weekend too?

41:36.640 --> 41:37.640
What are you doing?

41:37.960 --> 41:40.480
The sky looks so beautiful today.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.200
Yes, indeed.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.720
The sky is clear today.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.160
Yes, the perfect autumn sky.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.960
Your hair looks different today.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.800
It looks pretty.

42:16.120 --> 42:22.080
[Episode 23: Male-Female Friendship]

42:22.200 --> 42:24.840
That guy, Yoo Bobby. I think...

42:26.400 --> 42:28.760
No. I should wake Yu-mi's Guard.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.000
I have a bad feeling about this.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.120
Guard, wake up!

42:35.640 --> 42:37.680
Yu-mi ran into Yoo Bobby again
on her way to work.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.880
What? That jerk again?

42:41.600 --> 42:43.040
Your hair looks different today.

42:45.880 --> 42:46.960
It looks pretty.

42:58.920 --> 43:00.040
I knew it.

43:00.120 --> 43:03.600
You punk! You wanted to make a move on her
when I was asleep?

43:03.680 --> 43:04.840
Not a chance!

43:05.040 --> 43:06.400
Yu-mi's Guard, this is an order.

43:06.480 --> 43:09.200
Lock the Gates of the Heart at once
and be on red alert!

43:18.840 --> 43:20.320
Jeez, again?

43:21.840 --> 43:22.840
What?

43:23.720 --> 43:26.280
-Sorry?
-What did you say?

43:30.720 --> 43:32.920
What do you think of my outfit today?

43:34.160 --> 43:35.200
Your outfit?

43:35.280 --> 43:36.360
Yes, it's new.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.680
I think it looks good on you.

43:42.480 --> 43:43.480
Thank you.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.320
And your hair looks nice today.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.080
I have to go.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.200
What? Hold on.

43:52.280 --> 43:54.040
What was that? He left.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.800
I guess it was just a compliment,
nothing more.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.960
Yoo Bobby, that punk.
He really gets on my nerves.

44:06.160 --> 44:08.080
[Gosh, I'm so confused.]

44:08.160 --> 44:11.000
How can you tell whether or not
someone has feelings for you?

44:11.080 --> 44:13.640
You fool, shall I tell you how?

44:13.800 --> 44:15.760
Detective, can you tell?

44:15.840 --> 44:17.880
Of course! It's simple.

44:17.960 --> 44:20.400
Try thinking that Yoo Bobby is a woman.

44:21.480 --> 44:22.560
What? A woman?

44:22.640 --> 44:24.280
It'll help you analyze his actions

44:24.360 --> 44:26.400
in an objective manner.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.280
Wait, by any chance...

44:32.840 --> 44:33.880
Yes?

44:34.520 --> 44:36.280
Didn't you lose your umbrella?

44:36.840 --> 44:38.720
-Sorry?
-It looks like a fried egg.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.680
Yes! My gosh, it's mine.
The fried egg umbrella!

44:41.760 --> 44:43.200
Yes, it's mine.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.440
Right?

44:47.400 --> 44:49.240
On weekends,
it's nicer here in the morning.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.640
It's usually crowded during the day.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.960
On weekends,
I'm always here in the morning.

44:54.880 --> 44:55.960
I see.

44:56.920 --> 44:59.400
Yes, the perfect autumn sky.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.400
Your hair looks different today.

45:05.800 --> 45:07.120
It looks so pretty.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.360
[-Thank you.]
-I think he just wants to be her friend.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.720
I agree.
Now, it doesn't look weird at all.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.320
-Wait!
-What?

45:20.400 --> 45:23.200
Then Sae-yi didn't do
anything wrong either.

45:23.280 --> 45:24.880
This is okay, when that isn't?

45:26.600 --> 45:28.200
Woong, this is for you.

45:28.920 --> 45:29.960
It's yuzu tea.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.520
Oh, thanks.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.680
I made it myself.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.000
You have a cold, right?

45:36.280 --> 45:38.120
Take it home
and drink it every morning and evening.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.520
You have to, okay?

45:43.360 --> 45:46.640
Woong, let's get this for Yu-mi.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.040
This will look cute on her.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.320
You think so?

45:55.440 --> 45:56.480
Oh, no.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.520
You had something on your shirt.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.160
-Come on.
-You were wrong.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.680
-That's wrong!
-That's wrong!

46:12.360 --> 46:13.360
Woong.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.720
Am I old-fashioned?

46:17.000 --> 46:18.080
Yes.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.800
Hey, I want a serious answer.

46:21.080 --> 46:22.160
You want me to be serious?

46:23.480 --> 46:24.520
Yes.

46:24.840 --> 46:25.840
My gosh.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.640
Anyway, why do you ask?

46:29.360 --> 46:32.520
I was just wondering
if I was too old-fashioned

46:32.720 --> 46:34.480
when it comes to male-female friendships.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.960
You know, girls having male friends
and vice versa.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.240
Well, I'm not sure.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.200
But I'd say you're very cautious.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.680
Really?

46:45.880 --> 46:47.480
Am I weird?

46:49.240 --> 46:50.800
Do you have to work late again today?

46:51.400 --> 46:54.680
[Yes. Looks like I'll be working late
every day until the end of the month.]

46:59.200 --> 47:01.520
Then I'll be alone again this weekend.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.080
[Just like last weekend.]

47:04.440 --> 47:07.560
I'm sorry. I'll finish it this month
no matter what.

47:08.760 --> 47:11.880
Okay. Don't work too hard.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.280
You can do it.

47:13.360 --> 47:14.400
I can do it!

47:25.320 --> 47:27.120
What should I do today?

47:32.240 --> 47:33.680
Cabbage.

47:36.400 --> 47:39.440
Right, I'm out of sugar.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.320
No exercise today?

47:53.520 --> 47:55.680
What are you doing here?

47:55.880 --> 47:57.960
What do you think?
I'm here to get groceries, obviously.

47:59.480 --> 48:02.720
Looks like
we go to the same places, right?

48:04.800 --> 48:06.080
You think so?

48:08.840 --> 48:10.840
I guess
you're planning to make fish cutlets.

48:11.400 --> 48:13.560
Yes. My girlfriend is coming over later.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.160
She loves fish cutlets.

48:17.040 --> 48:18.120
I see.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.920
Do you happen to know
where I can find tartar sauce?

48:21.000 --> 48:22.320
Tartar sauce?

48:25.560 --> 48:26.640
You're going to buy it?

48:27.120 --> 48:29.080
It tastes way better
when you make it yourself.

48:29.680 --> 48:31.000
Isn't it hard to make?

48:31.240 --> 48:33.840
Not at all.
Do you have mayonnaise at home?

48:34.520 --> 48:35.560
Yes.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.920
Mix it with chopped onion and pickles.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.760
They must be finely chopped.

48:40.840 --> 48:42.480
Finely chop onion and pickles.

48:42.640 --> 48:46.560
Yes. After that, add a boiled egg
to that mixture.

48:47.040 --> 48:48.400
Rub the yolk through a sieve.

48:48.480 --> 48:50.120
Wait, hold on. You're going too fast.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.120
Is this right?

48:54.720 --> 48:56.480
Yes. After that,

48:56.960 --> 48:58.720
mix it with a hard-boiled egg.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.200
Mix them together.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.800
Yes. Rub the yolk through a sieve.

49:01.880 --> 49:04.360
Rub the yolk through a sieve.

49:06.640 --> 49:09.480
Emotion. Now, I'm thinking

49:10.000 --> 49:13.960
maybe it's possible for men and women
to be just friends.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.040
Then are you saying
we should accept Sae-yi?

49:17.200 --> 49:18.480
We should accept her too,

49:18.560 --> 49:20.480
if we're accepting Yu-mi's guy friend.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.280
I can't.

49:22.400 --> 49:24.960
I'm not a fan of the idea
that men and women can be friends.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.640
What was the other thing you said?
Lemon juice?

49:30.720 --> 49:32.760
Yes, one tablespoon of lemon juice.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.600
Again... I'm sorry.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.000
-I have to make a quick phone call.
-Sure.

49:45.600 --> 49:46.640
Hey, it's me.

49:50.360 --> 49:51.480
Then you can't come over today?

49:53.480 --> 49:55.640
What do you think?
I'm out grocery shopping now.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.480
Then why did you...

50:04.040 --> 50:06.640
Never mind.
I'll cook for you another time.

50:08.720 --> 50:10.720
It's okay. You must be busy,
so just get back to work.

50:12.600 --> 50:13.600
All right.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.640
She can't make it.

50:18.960 --> 50:22.600
I see. Your girlfriend must be very busy.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.400
I am in a relationship,

50:24.880 --> 50:27.280
but I'm even more bored
than when I was single.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.400
Then I'll see you at work.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.160
Enjoy your dinner.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.560
You too. Bye.

50:57.360 --> 51:00.360
[I know what it's like.]

51:11.800 --> 51:13.240
[Feeling lonely from time to time]

51:13.320 --> 51:15.240
[although you are in a relationship.]

51:19.760 --> 51:21.680
I guess he's really busy.

51:29.080 --> 51:30.520
This looks great.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.920
It's delicious.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.600
It's so good.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.120
I miss Woong.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.640
[Yu-mi, are you asleep?]

52:14.080 --> 52:15.960
[Yu-mi, are you asleep?]

52:15.000 --> 52:16.320
[No, not yet.]

52:16.040 --> 52:17.960
[No, not yet.]

52:18.040 --> 52:19.080
[I'm heading home now.]

52:18.240 --> 52:19.680
[I'm heading home now.]

52:21.160 --> 52:22.920
[You finished earlier than I thought.]

52:24.440 --> 52:26.160
[Yes. What did you do today?]

52:29.840 --> 52:32.560
[I made myself some tteokbokki at home]

52:32.640 --> 52:34.040
[and cleaned...]

52:36.080 --> 52:37.200
[Guys.]

52:41.680 --> 52:43.600
Why don't we surprise Woong?

52:43.680 --> 52:44.800
-What?
-How?

52:48.600 --> 52:51.760
[He'd never even think
that Yu-mi would come over now.]

52:51.840 --> 52:54.160
Good idea.
I like surprise events like this.

52:54.240 --> 52:57.920
Let's go to his place
and have some late-night snacks with him.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.360
Let's tell him she's going to bed now

53:00.440 --> 53:01.920
so we can surprise him.

53:03.840 --> 53:06.400
[You must be tired. Go to bed soon.]

53:06.480 --> 53:07.960
[I should go to bed too.]

53:09.480 --> 53:10.840
[Okay, sweet dreams.]

53:13.000 --> 53:14.560
[Have a dream about me.]

53:15.080 --> 53:17.200
[Have a dream about me.]

53:17.280 --> 53:18.360
[Okay, I'll try.]

53:17.680 --> 53:20.200
[Okay, I'll try.]

53:25.360 --> 53:27.240
If she shows up now,
he'll be so surprised.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.160
Guys, let's go see Woong!

53:29.240 --> 53:30.880
-Let's go!
-We'll see Woong!

53:30.960 --> 53:32.080
-Let's go!
-Gosh.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.240
She's going out again
when she's already washed up?

53:35.320 --> 53:38.760
And I wanted her
to put on a sheet mask now!

53:38.840 --> 53:41.200
Don't worry. We'll take two

53:41.280 --> 53:42.720
so they can do it together.

53:42.800 --> 53:44.680
-You're a genius.
-You rock!

53:51.320 --> 53:52.440
I should do this with him.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.800
Woong's skin has been looking
dry and dull.

53:56.600 --> 53:59.960
-Nice! Off to Woong's with sheet masks!
-Nice! Off to Woong's with sheet masks!

54:00.400 --> 54:02.360
-Wait!
-What?

54:02.440 --> 54:05.040
Tomorrow's Monday.
What is she going to wear to work?

54:06.400 --> 54:09.400
Don't tell me she'll wear
what she's wearing now.

54:09.480 --> 54:10.640
Don't you worry.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.960
She can take some clothes with her.

54:13.080 --> 54:15.680
-That's right.
-I see!

54:16.360 --> 54:18.280
I should also take some clothes
for tomorrow.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.920
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

54:40.040 --> 54:41.040
Thank you.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.080
[Woong will be so surprised.]

54:51.760 --> 54:53.280
[What should we do to tease him?]

54:53.360 --> 54:55.320
[Should we ring the doorbell and hide?]

55:04.240 --> 55:07.920
[How about we text him
right in front of his door?]

55:18.320 --> 55:20.160
[I can't wait to see
the look on Woong's face.]

55:20.520 --> 55:22.560
[I want to see Woong now!]

55:26.000 --> 55:27.120
[Fifth floor.]

55:34.120 --> 55:35.160
My gosh.

55:35.680 --> 55:36.680
What?

55:36.840 --> 55:38.280
-What?
-What?

55:38.360 --> 55:40.080
It's Sae-yi!

55:43.280 --> 55:44.400
Yu-mi.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.280
Hello.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.800
Sae-yi.

55:55.680 --> 55:58.320
Wait, what's going on?
What is Sae-yi doing here?

55:58.400 --> 56:01.560
Why did she get on the elevator
on the fifth floor?

56:06.960 --> 56:09.480
Right, you must be going to Woong's place.

56:11.520 --> 56:13.880
By the way, what are you doing here?

56:13.960 --> 56:15.760
I live in this building too.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.040
You didn't know?

56:18.560 --> 56:21.000
I moved into a unit on the fifth floor
last month.

56:21.920 --> 56:22.920
What?

56:23.040 --> 56:26.200
My gosh,
I guess Woong hasn't told you yet.

56:26.280 --> 56:29.040
But then again, why should he?
It's not even a big deal.

56:29.200 --> 56:31.520
I'm going to his place too.
I need to borrow something from him.

56:33.880 --> 56:36.680
What is this? What is going on?

56:37.320 --> 56:39.240
Sae-yi lives in the same building?

56:39.320 --> 56:42.400
Woong never told us.

56:42.720 --> 56:43.960
I'll look into it.

56:45.760 --> 56:47.280
What did you say?

56:50.320 --> 56:52.520
Emotion, did you escape from prison?

56:52.600 --> 56:54.960
Sae-yi lives in the same building?
Since when?

56:55.080 --> 56:58.880
What is this? What on earth
did you guys do while I was behind bars?

57:04.280 --> 57:05.440
[Tenth floor.]

57:12.480 --> 57:13.640
Aren't you getting out?

57:21.560 --> 57:24.960
Yu-mi, why are you just standing there?
Say something!

57:25.040 --> 57:27.200
Why are you all quiet?

57:27.280 --> 57:28.520
Where is Reaction Number One?

57:28.600 --> 57:30.760
We can't use it because of you.

57:31.360 --> 57:32.760
Darn it!

57:40.040 --> 57:43.200
This is my first time living on my own,
so there are many things I don't have.

57:43.800 --> 57:46.480
So I've been borrowing stuff from Woong.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.840
Thank goodness my friend is my neighbor.

57:56.760 --> 57:57.800
Shall I press it?

57:58.760 --> 57:59.800
Sure.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.760
I told you
to just buy some wine glasses...

58:11.960 --> 58:13.040
Yu-mi.

58:14.720 --> 58:16.120
I ran into her in the elevator.

58:16.680 --> 58:18.880
She didn't know I had moved
into this building.

58:24.800 --> 58:25.840
Thanks for this.

58:26.680 --> 58:27.720
No problem.

58:28.760 --> 58:29.840
Thank you.

58:31.760 --> 58:34.960
My friend is coming over
with a bottle of wine.

58:35.320 --> 58:37.760
I don't have any wine glasses,
so I asked him if I could borrow some.

58:38.680 --> 58:39.720
Thanks for these.

58:39.880 --> 58:40.920
No problem.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.640
-See you, Yu-mi.
-Bye.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.200
Right, Yu-mi.

58:50.600 --> 58:53.400
I'm going to throw a housewarming party.
You should come.

58:55.360 --> 58:57.080
Sure, please invite me.

58:58.120 --> 58:59.160
I'll be there.

58:59.920 --> 59:02.000
Okay, then have a good night.

59:02.880 --> 59:03.960
Good night.

59:09.560 --> 59:10.560
Yu-mi.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.840
What are you doing here?
You said you were going to bed.

59:17.080 --> 59:18.120
Come in.

59:23.080 --> 59:25.280
Come on in, Yu-mi.

59:42.920 --> 59:43.920
Come on in.

59:55.120 --> 59:56.520
What did I say?

59:56.800 --> 59:59.880
Men and women can be friends? As if.

1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:03.280
It's just not possible. See? I was right!

1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:06.240
Emotion, please quiet down.

1:00:06.320 --> 1:00:08.440
Don't raise your voice.
You just escaped from prison.

1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:14.640
I'm just so angry. I trusted Woong.

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.880
I was sure I could trust him!

1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:27.800
Yu-mi.

1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:23.360
[Yumi's Cells]

1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:25.960
[She wants to be your girlfriend
but pretends she's just a friend.]

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:27.360
[No!]

1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:29.640
[You're in a relationship,
but you don't look happy.]

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:31.440
[You seem stressed, so I'm worried.]

1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:33.640
No! Woong, snap out of it.

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:37.240
[What you and I had was very special.]

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:41.080
[There is nothing I can do
to push Sae-yi out of his life.]

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:42.600
[But whether or not]

1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:44.800
[I want to keep seeing him
is entirely up to me.]

1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:47.480
[Yu-mi is getting the Breakup Card.]

1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:46.720
[Breakup]

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.320
[Right, I wanted to ask you something.]

1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:51.960
What are you doing on Christmas Day?
