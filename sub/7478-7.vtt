WEBVTT

00:06.039 --> 00:07.509
Very, very nice.

00:07.533 --> 00:11.242
- Oh, thanks.
- You are welcome.

00:14.422 --> 00:16.332
- Let's have some champagne.
- Mm.

00:23.348 --> 00:26.100
- Coming true.
- Coming true.

01:30.665 --> 01:32.457
- It's done.
- Good.

01:33.335 --> 01:34.995
I gotta go.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.379
What are you doing?

02:30.225 --> 02:31.600
What's it look like I'm doing?

02:33.686 --> 02:34.861
You don't drink tea.

02:34.885 --> 02:37.684
No, I don't. I'm making it for Hetty.

02:38.274 --> 02:39.437
You're making tea for Hetty?

02:39.943 --> 02:41.318
I promised her I'd try some.

02:42.612 --> 02:47.523
Yellow Mountain Tribute
Chrysanthemum tea. Nice.

02:51.329 --> 02:53.381
That smells mouldy.

02:53.405 --> 02:55.953
Maybe it's supposed to
smell mouldy.

02:56.292 --> 02:58.783
You think I should
say something to her?

02:59.087 --> 03:00.890
They didn't train you for that
at SEAL school?

03:00.914 --> 03:02.227
Yeah, escape and evade.

03:02.251 --> 03:04.891
Mr. Hanna.

03:04.915 --> 03:07.904
- How's our tea?
- Right here, Hetty.

03:07.928 --> 03:10.385
Did you warm the pot
the way I told you to?

03:11.015 --> 03:13.067
- I did.
- And the water?

03:13.091 --> 03:16.079
- Fresh off the boil.
- Oh, excellent.

03:16.103 --> 03:18.239
You must never underestimate

03:18.263 --> 03:21.037
the cardiovascular benefits of tea.

03:21.061 --> 03:22.977
You'll thank me in the morning.

03:23.486 --> 03:25.371
- Mr. Callen?
- I'm good.

03:25.395 --> 03:29.735
Uh-huh.
And you, uh, can't taste the paper?

03:33.580 --> 03:39.096
Well, now, chrysanthemum tea
is not chrysanthemum tea

03:39.120 --> 03:41.891
without wolfberries.

03:41.915 --> 03:43.227
Wolfberries?

03:43.251 --> 03:48.357
Now, I want you to savour that
and consider its, um, calming qualities.

03:48.381 --> 03:50.711
Not to mention its health benefits.

03:59.564 --> 04:00.762
That's delicious.

04:06.404 --> 04:09.607
That phone call is for you,
Mr. Callen.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.527
Director Vance.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.197
Callen.

04:22.754 --> 04:23.952
Yes, director.

04:25.548 --> 04:27.090
Standby.

04:29.093 --> 04:30.232
How does she do that?

04:30.256 --> 04:33.595
I don't know, but that's the worst tea
I've ever had in my entire life.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.359
Mouldy.

04:55.370 --> 04:56.864
I got a call from the L.A.P.D.

04:57.455 --> 04:59.756
A woman was killed in an apartment
overlooking the marina

04:59.780 --> 05:01.096
a couple of days ago.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.969
They found a USB micro drive
hidden in her baseball cap.

05:04.993 --> 05:08.896
Had a file filled with what looks like
surveillance photos.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.144
Different locations, different people.

05:11.168 --> 05:13.171
- Anyone we know?
- Yes.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.341
You, Agent Callen.

05:16.432 --> 05:18.982
L.A.P.D. Ran the photos through
a facial recognition programme.

05:19.006 --> 05:21.533
Yours is the only one that got a hit.

05:21.557 --> 05:24.683
When they identified
your classified status, they called me.

05:26.567 --> 05:27.623
Who was the victim?

05:27.647 --> 05:30.392
They haven't been able
to identify her yet.

05:30.822 --> 05:33.834
Someone's been watching you,
Agent Callen.

05:33.858 --> 05:36.109
I need to know who,
need to know why.

05:36.619 --> 05:39.264
Anything you might have forgotten
to tell me about?

05:39.288 --> 05:41.033
Not that would explain this.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.893
L.A.P.D. Is onboard with us
being involved in the investigation?

05:44.917 --> 05:46.390
Full access.

05:46.414 --> 05:49.932
I e-mailed Eric their file along with
the contents of the flash drive.

05:49.956 --> 05:53.560
If you find anything that links this
to you getting shot six months ago,

05:53.584 --> 05:55.646
I need to know.

05:55.670 --> 05:59.263
Do I need to write that down for you,
Agent Callen?

05:59.642 --> 06:02.513
- I think I get it.
- Watch your back.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.624
Low-level encryption on a USB drive.

06:09.648 --> 06:10.910
Where do you wanna start?

06:10.934 --> 06:14.813
- Uh, paparazzi.
- That's as good a place as any.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.486
That's near your apartment in Venice.

06:18.995 --> 06:20.299
Just before I got shot.

06:20.323 --> 06:22.382
Said you felt
like you were being watched.

06:22.406 --> 06:24.681
They carried out surveillance,
pinpointed your home,

06:24.705 --> 06:26.512
made the hit
right there on the street.

06:26.536 --> 06:30.270
Mixed angles. Some high
from upper-storey-level windows.

06:30.294 --> 06:33.038
Some low at the street level.
All shot with a telephoto lens.

06:33.551 --> 06:37.062
- Over how many days, G?
- Two or three?

06:37.086 --> 06:39.196
Eric, L.A.P.D. File.

06:39.220 --> 06:42.284
Crime scene photos
of our unidentified victim.

06:42.308 --> 06:45.122
Furniture all seems to be
fold and carry.

06:45.146 --> 06:49.311
So she brought it in herself.
Maybe the apartment was vacant?

06:50.276 --> 06:51.521
Eric?

07:03.790 --> 07:04.790
G?

07:05.500 --> 07:07.160
That's her.

07:07.752 --> 07:08.867
The Russian girl.

07:09.378 --> 07:10.541
Who's the Russian girl?

07:11.798 --> 07:13.837
Last person I saw before I got shot.

07:30.732 --> 07:33.733
A lot of surveillance photos
of the same guy.

07:34.194 --> 07:36.626
None of them very clear.

07:36.650 --> 07:39.086
Not a great photographer,
your Russian girl.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.717
Not a willing subject.

07:40.741 --> 07:42.628
Can we find out
when they were taken, Eric?

07:42.652 --> 07:44.630
Yeah,
data's embedded in the JPEGs.

07:44.654 --> 07:47.557
All right. Oldest photo
was taken eight days ago,

07:47.581 --> 07:50.703
and the most recent was yesterday.

07:51.211 --> 07:53.180
The day she died.

07:53.204 --> 07:55.016
Long-term surveillance.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.018
She was working for someone.

07:57.042 --> 07:59.731
Whoever this guy is, he doesn't like
having his picture taken.

07:59.755 --> 08:02.525
Did you get enough data
to get a match on his face, Eric?

08:02.549 --> 08:06.554
No, I doubt it. He's either too far away,
partially obscured, or blurry.

08:08.228 --> 08:10.221
But I will give it a shot.

08:11.356 --> 08:13.123
Some of the photos
were taken at a marina.

08:13.147 --> 08:15.534
Including the photos of her.

08:15.558 --> 08:18.226
Her body was found in an apartment
in Marina del Rey too.

08:20.532 --> 08:22.571
Sam, Kensi.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.194
This mystery guy on the yacht...

08:25.996 --> 08:27.964
We're gonna have to try
to sharpen up these photos

08:27.988 --> 08:30.382
before we run them
through facial recognition.

08:30.406 --> 08:31.805
What did I miss?

08:31.829 --> 08:34.765
Heh. Unnamed dead Russian girl
who saw Callen get shot.

08:34.789 --> 08:36.078
Also known as a lead.

08:38.091 --> 08:41.174
Callen's cold case
just got warmed up.

08:47.058 --> 08:50.320
Uh, I need access
to a personnel file.

08:50.344 --> 08:53.248
Well, in your position
as our head shrink,

08:53.272 --> 08:55.539
you should already have
complete access.

08:55.563 --> 08:57.643
I think my file is a little out of date.

08:59.988 --> 09:01.506
What name?

09:01.530 --> 09:03.358
Callen.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.835
And...

09:17.464 --> 09:18.715
Callen, G.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.644
Anything in particular
you're looking for?

09:23.668 --> 09:26.051
The investigation
into Callen's shooting.

09:27.891 --> 09:29.967
Still unsolved.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.313
You worry
this case may open old wounds?

09:40.820 --> 09:43.109
I'm hoping we can help heal them.

09:45.033 --> 09:50.240
November-alpha,
forward-slash, 7-9-4.

09:52.332 --> 09:54.870
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

10:15.438 --> 10:17.490
- You sure you wanna do this?
- I'm fine.

10:17.514 --> 10:19.327
You sure you're allowed to do this?

10:19.351 --> 10:21.044
Victim investigating
his own shooting?

10:21.068 --> 10:22.836
Not my shooting, it's a Russian girl's.

10:22.860 --> 10:25.543
He'll keep investigating
until someone tells him he can't.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.839
- Someone I have to listen to.
- Rules me out.

10:27.863 --> 10:29.919
You never listen to me
even when you have to.

10:29.943 --> 10:32.468
- Name one time.
- You're not listening to me now.

10:32.492 --> 10:35.071
- Yeah, I am.
- No, you're not.

10:36.167 --> 10:37.792
How long you two been married?

10:41.297 --> 10:42.875
Thanks.

10:50.598 --> 10:52.757
- Unfurnished.
- It's on the market.

10:56.730 --> 11:00.264
She was sitting here,
back to the door.

11:01.818 --> 11:03.668
Shooter came up from behind her.

11:03.692 --> 11:06.376
See that blood spatter?
It starts low and then rises,

11:06.400 --> 11:07.853
which means she never stood up.

11:08.742 --> 11:10.781
Excuse me.

11:11.536 --> 11:14.299
Laptop power cable
and video lead right there.

11:14.323 --> 11:16.799
Killer took the laptop
and the video camera with him.

11:16.823 --> 11:20.203
Missed the micro drive
that was tucked away in her ball cap.

11:22.005 --> 11:23.440
Oh, hello.

11:23.464 --> 11:25.933
We've got three scuff marks here.

11:25.957 --> 11:27.877
Camera was on a tripod.

11:29.053 --> 11:32.481
Right about here.

11:32.505 --> 11:34.069
Angle's about right.

11:34.093 --> 11:37.636
The guy she was watching
was on one of those yachts out there.

11:38.605 --> 11:40.158
You can't just camp out
in an apartment

11:40.182 --> 11:41.827
without anybody knowing.

11:41.851 --> 11:43.329
What about
the apartment manager?

11:43.353 --> 11:45.080
Says he didn't know she was here.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.665
So where did she get a key?

11:46.689 --> 11:48.630
Maybe she didn't have one.

11:48.654 --> 11:51.255
She could have snuck in.
Maybe she's a pro?

11:51.279 --> 11:52.993
No, she's not a professional.

11:53.495 --> 11:56.033
A pro wouldn't leave their back
to the front door.

11:56.706 --> 12:00.040
No, she had a key.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.267
- How many bedrooms?
- Uh, just me.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.686
Ocean view or marina?

12:06.710 --> 12:09.432
- What's the difference?
- About 300.

12:09.456 --> 12:11.688
- A month?
- No, a week, sweetie.

12:11.712 --> 12:14.984
Look, I know some cheap places
on Pico, I'll get you the number.

12:15.008 --> 12:18.362
Listen,
I just need something short-term.

12:18.386 --> 12:21.075
I don't even have any furniture.
I just...

12:21.099 --> 12:22.814
I just need a place to crash.

12:23.316 --> 12:24.395
How short-term?

12:24.901 --> 12:26.561
Three weeks?

12:27.445 --> 12:29.189
It's gonna have to be cash
in advance.

12:29.697 --> 12:31.073
Okay.

12:32.242 --> 12:33.546
Well, I got a vacancy.

12:33.570 --> 12:35.570
New owner is moving in
in about a month.

12:37.163 --> 12:39.048
Three hundred a week,
or we could work out

12:39.072 --> 12:41.953
some other sort of arrangement.

12:45.797 --> 12:47.671
Less than 40 seconds.

12:48.466 --> 12:50.008
What?

12:50.718 --> 12:52.794
Less than 40 seconds.

12:53.471 --> 12:55.570
- She's good.
- She's better than good.

12:55.594 --> 12:56.880
We owe 10 bucks.

12:57.392 --> 12:58.447
Five a piece.

12:58.471 --> 13:00.991
You bet her she couldn't get an offer
in under a minute.

13:01.015 --> 13:02.979
Yup, and you stood there
and let me do it.

13:03.523 --> 13:05.076
I'm not giving you $5.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.473
- Oh, you're not?
- No.

13:07.896 --> 13:10.026
She's good.

13:10.655 --> 13:13.360
- Who's that?
- Ever heard of NCIS?

13:14.284 --> 13:15.588
No.

13:15.612 --> 13:17.742
FBI, DEA, CIA?

13:18.788 --> 13:21.848
Look, this is just a misunderstanding.
I was trying to help you out.

13:21.872 --> 13:23.809
Just like you tried to help
the Russian girl

13:23.833 --> 13:26.765
who was found killed
in the apartment this week?

13:26.789 --> 13:28.848
I guess you forgot to tell the L.A.P.D.

13:28.872 --> 13:32.168
That, uh, you rented her
the apartment for cash?

13:33.344 --> 13:34.601
Eh, Freddy?

13:34.625 --> 13:37.816
- It's Teddy.
- Cute.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.946
Security footage
from the apartment building.

13:40.970 --> 13:43.907
Humph. Funny how the apartment
manager suddenly remembered

13:43.931 --> 13:45.979
he hadn't deleted
the security footage.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.286
What did it cost her for the room?

13:49.310 --> 13:51.028
Her life.

13:52.071 --> 13:54.373
Her body was found
Sunday evening.

13:54.397 --> 13:57.753
Coroner placed her time of death
at 5:30 p.m.

13:57.777 --> 13:59.837
All right, fast forwarding to Sunday.

13:59.861 --> 14:03.157
Looking for our killer leaving
with her bag and a camera tripod.

14:05.835 --> 14:07.460
Gotcha.

14:09.047 --> 14:11.015
All right, time stamp says 5:47.

14:11.039 --> 14:12.378
That's gotta be our guy.

14:13.176 --> 14:15.228
He's facing away from the camera
when he's leaving.

14:15.252 --> 14:17.800
Let's see where he's looking
when he arrives.

14:23.936 --> 14:25.846
- Humph.
- He knew the camera was there.

14:26.356 --> 14:28.787
- He's a pro.
- Yeah, he's good.

14:28.811 --> 14:30.370
But he's not great.

14:30.394 --> 14:32.620
He did leave the USB drive behind.

14:32.644 --> 14:34.706
Well, that's not the only thing
that he missed.

14:34.730 --> 14:38.298
She was backing up her files
onto a virtual-storage account.

14:38.322 --> 14:39.667
From the apartment?

14:39.691 --> 14:41.672
Tapped into the apartment's
wireless router.

14:41.696 --> 14:44.872
- Does she have a name?
- Username only, Citizen 25.

14:47.126 --> 14:50.056
Whoa, that is a lot of files
to scroll through.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.345
Yeah.

14:51.369 --> 14:53.623
Okay, let's start at the beginning.

15:02.350 --> 15:03.548
You wanna share, G?

15:04.060 --> 15:05.554
The file named Cossack, Dom.

15:07.814 --> 15:09.118
And what's Cossack?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.604
Joint operation in Europe
against the Russian mafia.

15:15.113 --> 15:16.334
Oh, boy.

15:16.358 --> 15:17.752
Three-man team.

15:17.776 --> 15:19.194
Ethan Stanhope.

15:20.118 --> 15:21.718
He worked for the CIA.

15:21.742 --> 15:23.796
Ricky Taylor.

15:23.820 --> 15:26.380
DEA, same as me.

15:26.404 --> 15:27.803
When?

15:27.827 --> 15:29.281
Ten years ago.

15:30.670 --> 15:35.083
You guys, guys. I got something.
Stanhope and Taylor are both dead.

15:36.467 --> 15:37.606
Murdered.

15:37.630 --> 15:39.878
Stanhope in Vegas,
Taylor in Chicago.

15:40.471 --> 15:42.321
And they were both killed
on the same day.

15:42.345 --> 15:43.630
Fifth of May.

15:43.933 --> 15:44.933
G!

15:46.144 --> 15:47.970
Stay with me, G.
Don't do this to me. Come on!

15:49.230 --> 15:50.689
The same day I should have died.

16:04.778 --> 16:08.621
Traffic cam captured Stanhope
being shot in Las Vegas.

16:08.645 --> 16:10.958
Taylor's shooting in Chicago
was also a drive-by.

16:10.982 --> 16:13.567
- Same as, um...
- Mine.

16:16.831 --> 16:18.374
Anybody charged for either murder?

16:18.875 --> 16:19.875
No.

16:20.669 --> 16:22.376
When's the last time
you saw those guys?

16:23.254 --> 16:24.962
When we were debriefed in Berlin.

16:25.715 --> 16:27.399
I haven't seen them in ten years.

16:27.423 --> 16:29.110
Did you ever catch the bad guys?

16:29.134 --> 16:31.876
No.
It was a joint operation with Russia.

16:32.722 --> 16:35.023
There was a syndicate
trying to manipulate the flow of oil

16:35.047 --> 16:37.526
from the Black Sea into Europe,

16:37.550 --> 16:39.601
and someone let them know
that we were coming.

16:41.231 --> 16:42.405
How come the DEA
was involved?

16:42.429 --> 16:45.643
Loan out. Taylor and I
both spoke fluent Russian.

16:46.569 --> 16:47.898
CIA set it up?

16:48.947 --> 16:50.275
Stanhope was their point person.

16:50.907 --> 16:52.626
But we only ever saw him in the bar,

16:52.650 --> 16:55.233
drinking expensive vodka
and eating caviar.

16:55.745 --> 16:59.221
- Did you ever find who betrayed you?
- No.

16:59.245 --> 17:03.306
Okay, so some Russian girl
gets killed while running surveillance

17:03.330 --> 17:05.935
on an unidentified guy in a yacht,

17:05.959 --> 17:09.381
which is somehow connected to
an operation in Russia ten years ago.

17:10.135 --> 17:12.970
Who was the Russian contact
for Operation Cossack?

17:13.722 --> 17:15.132
Arkady Kolcheck.

17:15.682 --> 17:18.327
He was an officer in the KGB. Last
known address would be Moscow.

17:18.351 --> 17:20.819
The dead girl only had files
on people who were targeted,

17:20.843 --> 17:22.348
not anyone named Kolcheck.

17:22.856 --> 17:24.266
Eric, dead or alive?

17:24.773 --> 17:26.742
Alive and well.

17:26.767 --> 17:31.071
And as of 2007, an American citizen
living in Studio City.

17:31.740 --> 17:35.049
Makes you wonder where Arkady was
on the fifth of May, huh?

17:35.073 --> 17:37.971
- Eric, I need that address.
- Already downloaded into your GPS.

17:37.995 --> 17:40.215
I really need to know
who that was on the yacht.

17:40.239 --> 17:42.763
- Working on it.
- Kensi, I need a profile on Arkady.

17:42.787 --> 17:45.722
Everything you can get, okay?
His friends, his business associates,

17:45.746 --> 17:46.928
allies, enemies.

17:46.952 --> 17:50.060
I wanna know why he left the KGB
in Russia and who he paid to get here.

17:50.084 --> 17:52.725
- Work with Nate.
- Okay, okay.

17:52.749 --> 17:55.145
Arkady Kolcheck.

17:55.169 --> 17:57.006
Do you know him?

17:57.348 --> 17:59.317
We've met, uh, once or twice.

17:59.341 --> 18:01.118
Read about him in Callen's file.

18:01.142 --> 18:03.493
- Was there a lot to read?
- Ooh, pages.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.451
And 90 percent of it that was redacted.
Yeah.

18:06.475 --> 18:09.686
Censored by whomever it is
that redacts things.

18:10.195 --> 18:12.459
Okay, can we get
an uncensored copy?

18:12.483 --> 18:18.741
Have you ever tried Egyptian
Liquorice Mint tea, Miss Blye?

18:27.128 --> 18:28.764
Where does she get this stuff?

18:28.788 --> 18:31.252
None of it is redacted.
Not a single word.

18:32.175 --> 18:34.582
What if she's the redactor?

18:34.886 --> 18:36.107
There's a scary thought.

18:36.131 --> 18:37.395
Hetty is the clearing house

18:37.419 --> 18:40.302
for every censored government
document released to the public.

18:43.394 --> 18:46.064
That's impossible.

18:48.233 --> 18:50.272
Yeah, ridiculous. Ahem.

18:50.568 --> 18:53.415
Anyway,
Arkady's done well for himself.

18:53.439 --> 18:55.416
He's a security consultant.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.378
Retained by big business
and foreign governments alike.

18:58.402 --> 19:00.960
And it pays well.
He's got properties in New York City,

19:00.984 --> 19:02.846
Los Angeles and Paris.

19:02.870 --> 19:08.958
So how does a former KGB agent
end up so wealthy so fast?

19:09.212 --> 19:12.960
Because he knows
where the bodies are buried.

19:14.259 --> 19:17.378
Most likely because
he's the one who buried them.

19:22.058 --> 19:24.157
- We got a plan?
- How about we kick in his door,

19:24.181 --> 19:26.534
ask him why he's the only one
that didn't get shot?

19:26.558 --> 19:29.279
I've used that one before,
it's a very effective plan.

19:29.303 --> 19:32.898
It's good as long as you know what's
behind the door, it always works.

19:36.781 --> 19:37.788
Yes, Eric.

19:37.812 --> 19:39.959
Good news and bad news.

19:39.983 --> 19:43.053
The bad news is that Arkady's house
is state-of-the-art.

19:43.077 --> 19:46.805
It is seriously impressive.
He spent a small fortune on security.

19:46.829 --> 19:48.470
The grounds are covered
with a network

19:48.494 --> 19:50.767
of electronic motion sensors
and microphones.

19:50.791 --> 19:53.690
He's got infrared
and high-definition daylight cameras.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.373
And it's a closed system.
I can't even access it.

19:56.926 --> 19:58.562
That's an impressive door.

19:58.586 --> 20:01.442
- We might have to kick it a few times.
- And the good news?

20:01.466 --> 20:03.904
The good news is the car's equipped
with a GPS device.

20:03.928 --> 20:05.191
I hacked into it.

20:05.215 --> 20:08.370
So he's on the move. It is a Maybach.

20:08.394 --> 20:09.737
We're feeding it to your GPS.

20:09.761 --> 20:12.477
It should show up any second
on your screen as a red icon.

20:14.694 --> 20:17.066
It's actually coming towards us.

20:17.947 --> 20:19.121
Turning left into...

20:19.145 --> 20:21.209
Left into what?
I need a street name, G.

20:21.233 --> 20:22.630
Where is he going?

20:22.654 --> 20:26.089
I don't know, but we're not going
with him if you don't tell what street.

20:26.113 --> 20:27.676
Shopping.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.558
He's going shopping.

20:29.582 --> 20:31.968
- Let's go shopping.
- Okay.

20:31.992 --> 20:33.913
Let's go shopping.

20:41.888 --> 20:45.731
Humph.
Bodyguards are tight. Disciplined.

20:45.755 --> 20:48.116
Probably former military.

20:48.140 --> 20:49.342
That's him?

20:50.438 --> 20:52.063
That's him.

20:53.191 --> 20:55.349
You got another plan?

20:58.446 --> 21:00.984
I guess that's plan B, huh?

21:01.324 --> 21:02.355
I got it.

21:29.685 --> 21:30.884
Tanner, on your six.

21:38.444 --> 21:39.879
I thought I recognised you.

21:39.903 --> 21:42.110
- Do I know you?
- No, but you know my fiancée.

21:42.782 --> 21:44.715
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, now you wanna apologise?

21:44.739 --> 21:47.043
- Apologise?
- You didn't think I'd find out, did you?

21:47.067 --> 21:50.056
Take a look at this home wrecker.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.801
- He's got kids!
- Back off, friend.

21:51.825 --> 21:53.743
I'm not your friend
and I'm not his friend.

21:54.252 --> 21:57.513
- What is it with this guy?
- I'm trying to tell him I don't know him.

21:57.537 --> 21:59.397
- You got the wrong guy, buddy.
- Joelene.

21:59.421 --> 22:02.484
Tuesdays and Fridays in the storeroom
behind the florist shop.

22:02.508 --> 22:04.895
Don't even try to deny it, man.
I got witnesses.

22:04.919 --> 22:07.397
I don't know you,
and I don't know Joelene.

22:07.421 --> 22:09.057
A light moustache.

22:09.559 --> 22:12.951
- Big leg Joelene, with the Jheri curls.
- I don't know you.

22:12.975 --> 22:15.280
All of a sudden now
you're ashamed to know Joelene?

22:15.304 --> 22:18.186
She ain't good enough for you?
That's my girl.

22:23.531 --> 22:24.646
Nice car, Arkady.

22:25.825 --> 22:28.398
It's all right, Alex.

22:28.703 --> 22:31.988
Mr. Callen is a friend
from the old days.

22:36.169 --> 22:37.960
I heard that you were dead.

22:38.463 --> 22:39.791
Like Stanhope and Taylor?

22:42.049 --> 22:45.441
And I alone unscathed.
You think I was responsible?

22:45.465 --> 22:47.296
Were you?

22:48.014 --> 22:49.045
No.

22:52.059 --> 22:53.554
Give me a reason to believe you.

22:55.730 --> 22:57.557
I sent someone to warn you.

22:58.065 --> 23:00.959
I tried to warn Stanhope
and Taylor as well.

23:00.983 --> 23:02.611
You sent who to warn me?

23:03.696 --> 23:05.356
A Russian girl.

23:08.409 --> 23:09.927
Why didn't you just
warn me yourself?

23:09.951 --> 23:12.218
I knew you did not trust me
because of what happened

23:12.242 --> 23:14.406
in Moscow ten years ago.

23:15.458 --> 23:17.830
So, what makes you think
I would trust some Russian girl?

23:19.587 --> 23:21.211
You knew her.

23:23.841 --> 23:27.921
When you were a boy,
you used to bounce her on your knee.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.221
- Her name was...
- Alina.

23:38.397 --> 23:40.520
Her name was Alina.

23:53.027 --> 23:55.043
Nice crib, Arkady.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.792
How'd you know about her?

23:56.816 --> 23:58.781
You told me, ten years ago.

23:59.325 --> 24:01.792
When I asked you
where you learned Russian,

24:01.816 --> 24:06.372
you said from a little girl
named Alina Rostoff.

24:08.877 --> 24:11.035
I filed it away.

24:11.379 --> 24:12.933
Is there anything
you don't file away?

24:12.957 --> 24:17.211
Heh. Everything is useful
sooner or later.

24:18.470 --> 24:23.178
I heard rumours
that someone had targeted us.

24:23.683 --> 24:26.862
I tried to contact everyone,
warn them,

24:26.886 --> 24:28.781
tell them to be careful.

24:28.805 --> 24:30.889
You seen Joelene?

24:31.900 --> 24:35.708
But Stanhope and Taylor,
they had retired.

24:35.732 --> 24:40.588
Lost to the dream
you Americans so fervently pursue.

24:40.612 --> 24:43.251
You're the only one left
in the game, G.

24:43.275 --> 24:45.468
So I called in a favour,

24:45.492 --> 24:48.344
got an address
where you might be living.

24:48.368 --> 24:52.218
I knew if she found you,
you would believe her.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.795
You didn't think I'd believe you?

24:56.216 --> 24:58.885
- Do you?
- Not yet.

25:02.180 --> 25:03.816
But I barely knew her.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.806
I was 14, she was 4 years old.

25:08.686 --> 25:10.513
That's how she said
she would greet you

25:11.731 --> 25:13.273
and you would remember her.

25:13.858 --> 25:15.981
She tried once. I...

25:21.366 --> 25:23.334
I scared her away. I...

25:23.358 --> 25:25.860
And the second time, it was too late.

25:27.080 --> 25:29.405
She wept for you.

25:32.210 --> 25:34.593
She thought you were dead.
We all did.

25:34.617 --> 25:37.975
Callen was lucky.
Stanhope and Taylor weren't.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.858
So, what does that make you,
Arkady?

25:39.882 --> 25:41.296
Prepared.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.779
The day you were shot,
they came for me.

25:44.803 --> 25:47.025
Since then, two more times.

25:47.049 --> 25:49.798
- They're beginning to annoy me.
- Who are they?

25:51.479 --> 25:54.433
You remember what
Operation Cossack was about?

25:55.024 --> 25:57.752
Of course. The, uh, Russian Mafia
was being paid off

25:57.776 --> 26:00.898
to allow the flow
of Russian oil into Europe.

26:01.322 --> 26:03.207
Our job was to try
and infiltrate the syndicate

26:03.231 --> 26:05.175
and find out who was being paid off.

26:05.199 --> 26:09.033
And before we could even start,
we were betrayed.

26:09.539 --> 26:10.819
Why come after you now?

26:11.624 --> 26:15.812
Next week,
they're signing a billion-dollar deal

26:15.836 --> 26:18.934
opening up the flow of oil
out of Russia into Europe.

26:18.958 --> 26:22.062
They're legitimising their corruption.

26:22.086 --> 26:24.727
The deal was brokered
by an American in the oil business.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.554
His name is John Cole.

26:27.056 --> 26:28.277
He works for the syndicate?

26:28.301 --> 26:31.286
Ahh, maybe he is the syndicate.

26:31.310 --> 26:32.485
For whatever reason,

26:32.509 --> 26:35.580
someone believed it better
the four of us not be around

26:35.604 --> 26:37.980
to see the deal signed.

26:41.321 --> 26:43.112
And Alina?

26:47.493 --> 26:50.506
I had her find out
everything she could about Cole.

26:50.530 --> 26:54.204
She found out
he liked to stay on a yacht.

26:54.459 --> 26:56.167
I set up surveillance.

26:59.505 --> 27:01.688
- So you used her.
- I trained her.

27:01.712 --> 27:04.456
- Because she was a pretty girl...
- She wanted to avenge you.

27:09.349 --> 27:10.523
She waited.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.409
She watched.

27:12.433 --> 27:14.559
And then finally there he was.

27:15.521 --> 27:18.143
And one day later, Alina was dead.

27:26.699 --> 27:29.024
Everything I know about John Cole.

27:39.462 --> 27:42.546
It worries you
how little there is in his file.

27:44.092 --> 27:45.526
Every time I come back to it,

27:45.550 --> 27:47.687
I hope someone
has filled in the blanks.

27:47.711 --> 27:50.021
It's all just a single page.

27:50.045 --> 27:53.140
No family history, no next of kin.

27:53.935 --> 27:56.971
All the things we take for granted.

28:01.150 --> 28:04.566
You don't think
I should let him work this case.

28:06.948 --> 28:10.008
I could put in an official psychological
assessment to Director Vance

28:10.032 --> 28:11.481
recommending he didn't.

28:12.829 --> 28:16.529
And the director would be obliged
to accept your recommendation.

28:17.708 --> 28:20.436
And I'd lose the trust
of everyone else on the team.

28:20.460 --> 28:26.191
Nate, what others may view
as the most inconsequential of things

28:26.215 --> 28:28.732
can be a revelation to Callen.

28:28.756 --> 28:31.656
A thread here, a scrap there.

28:31.680 --> 28:36.308
Maybe this time,
a tiny piece of the fabric of his life.

28:37.061 --> 28:38.520
And if it goes badly?

28:39.188 --> 28:42.604
Well, then you get to tell me
I was wrong.

28:44.318 --> 28:46.525
The director
gets to rip me a new one.

28:50.616 --> 28:51.779
And Callen?

28:53.077 --> 28:56.078
Does what he's always done.

28:56.456 --> 28:57.618
Survive.

28:59.834 --> 29:02.586
Okay, let's see
what Arkady's got for us.

29:03.504 --> 29:06.730
John Cole.

29:06.754 --> 29:08.692
Lives in the shadows.

29:08.716 --> 29:12.312
He's got an oil refinery company
which he bought seven years ago.

29:12.336 --> 29:14.398
Who's his friend?

29:14.422 --> 29:18.181
His friend is Max Tyrus.

29:18.644 --> 29:20.613
- Could be a bodyguard.
- Could be our killer.

29:20.637 --> 29:23.411
Same height and build
as the guy in the apartment video.

29:23.435 --> 29:25.896
So, Eric, what else do we have?

29:26.903 --> 29:29.666
Not a lot. This guy has built
some serious firewalls

29:29.690 --> 29:31.832
around his personal life
and business operations.

29:31.856 --> 29:33.633
He's even got his own server.

29:33.657 --> 29:35.296
Current location?

29:35.320 --> 29:37.037
The usual tricks
are coming up blank.

29:37.538 --> 29:40.800
Cole is as close to invisible
as anyone I've ever seen.

29:40.824 --> 29:43.514
He's not leaving
an electronic footprint anywhere.

29:43.538 --> 29:46.439
That hand gesture
looked like a sign of surrender, Eric.

29:46.463 --> 29:48.101
I was just stretching my arms.

29:48.125 --> 29:49.853
Forget about Cole for a second,
okay?

29:49.877 --> 29:52.838
Find Max Tyrus. You find Max Tyrus,
you're gonna find Cole.

29:57.391 --> 29:59.443
Okay, okay. Luck's changing.

29:59.467 --> 30:01.304
Max Tyrus.
I got a cell-phone number.

30:01.812 --> 30:02.975
GPS is blocked.

30:03.606 --> 30:05.017
Pulling up his call log.

30:05.942 --> 30:08.587
Hmm, last call was made
from Cole's refinery

30:08.611 --> 30:11.957
to a jet charter company
30 minutes ago.

30:11.981 --> 30:13.710
Planning a trip.

30:13.734 --> 30:15.758
When did Arkady say
the deal is being signed?

30:15.782 --> 30:17.967
- End of the week.
- Where?

30:17.991 --> 30:21.911
Moscow.
Eric, call that charter company.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.980
- Rask Jet Charter.
- Hi. I called about 30 minutes ago.

30:29.004 --> 30:30.608
Okay, what's your name, please?

30:30.632 --> 30:33.267
Yeah, Max Tyrus.
It was for West Oil Consolidated.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.608
The charter to Moscow.

30:34.632 --> 30:36.155
- Tyrus?
- That's right.

30:36.179 --> 30:38.529
- Can you just confirm the details?
- Departs 6:30.

30:38.553 --> 30:40.657
- And the return?
- Uh, no return booked.

30:40.681 --> 30:42.571
Ha, ha. What am I thinking?
Of course.

30:42.595 --> 30:45.095
- Jet will be waiting for you.
- Thank you so much.

30:46.857 --> 30:48.114
Leaves in less than four hours.

30:48.138 --> 30:50.440
- Returning?
- One way.

30:50.945 --> 30:54.005
Guys, we don't have evidence
to stop him from leaving the country.

30:54.029 --> 30:56.772
We're gonna get one shot at this.

30:58.286 --> 30:59.993
You got a plan?

31:01.163 --> 31:03.654
Well, he already thinks I'm dead.

31:05.543 --> 31:08.057
Let's see how he reacts
when he finds out I'm not.

31:08.081 --> 31:10.959
We've got to get in the oil refinery.

31:11.299 --> 31:12.544
Attract his attention.

31:13.592 --> 31:16.843
If I'm the owner of an oil refinery,

31:17.430 --> 31:19.755
who do I fear the most?

31:20.308 --> 31:21.968
EPA inspectors.

31:23.978 --> 31:25.389
I do.

31:26.022 --> 31:33.163
EPA guidelines and credentials
to get you guys through the gate.

31:33.187 --> 31:35.545
Mm-hm. Nice.

31:35.569 --> 31:38.313
And for us, a button cam.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.796
You don't know what Cole looks like.

31:40.820 --> 31:42.880
Well, based on the photos,
he's blurry looking.

31:42.904 --> 31:44.385
But he knows what you look like,

31:44.409 --> 31:47.263
which means your cover is blown
the moment he sees you.

31:47.287 --> 31:50.140
Yeah, but he also thinks I'm dead,
which gives me the advantage.

31:50.164 --> 31:52.105
So you're going in as bait?

31:52.129 --> 31:54.681
Just trying to get him to react,
to attack you?

31:54.705 --> 31:57.481
Yeah, and if he does, we've got him.

31:57.505 --> 31:58.876
Do you have a problem, Nate?

32:04.602 --> 32:07.009
Look, the first few seconds
will be critical.

32:09.106 --> 32:13.127
Just don't give him time to think, or
else he'll see what you're trying to do,

32:13.151 --> 32:16.236
and he won't react
the way you want him to.

32:16.614 --> 32:18.156
Thanks.

32:20.659 --> 32:22.237
I'm good?

32:23.037 --> 32:24.579
Kensi.

32:53.442 --> 32:55.067
I'm in.

32:56.946 --> 32:59.733
Callen, good to go.

33:03.828 --> 33:07.054
How you doing? EPA.

33:07.078 --> 33:10.118
It's time for your unscheduled
health and safety inspection.

33:11.127 --> 33:13.664
I'm gonna have to check you
for regulation compliance.

33:14.380 --> 33:16.040
Okay.

33:20.803 --> 33:22.345
Thank you, friend.

33:28.561 --> 33:30.352
Hey, EPA coming in.

33:36.485 --> 33:37.979
We on the air, Eric?

33:39.363 --> 33:40.526
Picture's up.

33:41.031 --> 33:43.961
Excuse me, ma'am. EPA.

33:43.985 --> 33:45.678
Yes, can I help you?

33:45.702 --> 33:47.589
Is your boss here?

33:47.613 --> 33:49.721
Through the breezeway,
first door on your right.

33:49.745 --> 33:51.326
Thank you.

34:07.433 --> 34:09.485
Yeah, I got them.

34:09.509 --> 34:11.203
Excuse me.

34:11.226 --> 34:14.870
This is the, uh, third EPA inspection
we've had this year.

34:14.893 --> 34:17.248
Ha! Tell me about it.
It's new paperwork every time.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.830
Personally, I think it's overkill.

34:18.853 --> 34:21.779
I mean, one report with supplementals,
that's all it needs.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.440
Unless there's an issue.

34:25.993 --> 34:27.962
Oh, God. Yeah, seriously,
you don't want an issue.

34:27.985 --> 34:29.632
I mean, filling out those E37 s.

34:29.656 --> 34:31.704
I wanna call your boss.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.330
Won't stand in your way.

34:37.922 --> 34:40.128
And I don't think you wanna
stand in ours either.

34:44.178 --> 34:45.731
I'm gonna need to see the usuals,
okay?

34:45.755 --> 34:48.657
The outflow reports, the, uh,
monitoring logs, the test results.

34:48.681 --> 34:51.719
- What's in here?
- It's off-limits to visitors.

34:52.436 --> 34:53.954
You think we're visitors?

34:53.978 --> 34:56.766
- This is a working refinery.
- And that's why we're here.

35:00.235 --> 35:02.288
G, behind you.

35:02.312 --> 35:03.839
Could be Cole.

35:03.863 --> 35:06.237
What seems to be the problem?

35:16.877 --> 35:18.252
They said you were dead.

35:18.754 --> 35:20.581
They said the same thing about you.

35:24.134 --> 35:26.780
Kensi,
meet an old friend from Moscow.

35:26.804 --> 35:28.654
Ethan Stanhope.

35:28.678 --> 35:30.425
Now known as John Cole.

35:35.604 --> 35:38.356
I think we just lost the advantage.

35:49.483 --> 35:52.460
You pay people good money,
you expect them to finish the job.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.646
Maybe you can get a refund?

35:55.781 --> 35:58.794
Must have cost you a lot to falsify
a death certificate in Vegas.

35:58.818 --> 36:01.970
- Who'd they shoot anyways?
- Someone no one would miss.

36:01.994 --> 36:04.215
World's full of them.
Couldn't afford people asking

36:04.239 --> 36:06.384
why I had survived
and the rest of you hadn't.

36:06.408 --> 36:08.268
That's why I thought Arkady
was behind this.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.145
Said you tried to kill him,
you missed.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.559
Two times.

36:11.583 --> 36:13.583
Third time's the charm.
Set for next week.

36:14.091 --> 36:15.312
Well, I misjudged him.

36:15.336 --> 36:19.104
Lots of people do.
Still fighting the old enemy, you know?

36:19.128 --> 36:21.713
Even though the curtain's down
and the wall is rubble.

36:24.101 --> 36:25.679
I need to remember to apologise.

36:27.188 --> 36:28.647
So this was all about the oil.

36:30.066 --> 36:31.785
Deal's about to be signed.

36:31.809 --> 36:33.704
Gonna have to show myself,
go public.

36:33.728 --> 36:35.836
And if any of those three men
saw you, then...

36:35.860 --> 36:38.758
It would have been embarrassing,
not to mention costly.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.918
What is the going rate these days
to sell out

36:40.942 --> 36:43.194
to a Russian crime syndicate,
Ethan?

36:45.831 --> 36:47.954
More than I'll ever spend.

36:48.751 --> 36:49.972
How many hits did you take?

36:49.996 --> 36:52.494
Five. Thanks for asking.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.084
I'll just need one.

36:58.803 --> 36:59.858
Sam, you got a shot?

36:59.882 --> 37:02.971
Yeah, but if it goes through him,
I'm gonna hit a gas storage tank.

37:05.893 --> 37:08.728
You don't really think
we came here alone, do you?

37:09.772 --> 37:12.559
My car is at the back service gate.
Go.

39:00.466 --> 39:03.135
Don't move. Don't you move.

39:06.639 --> 39:08.762
- We good?
- We're good.

39:09.266 --> 39:11.401
Turn over, tough guy. Turn over.

39:11.425 --> 39:12.765
Turn over.

39:14.105 --> 39:15.848
Put your hands behind your back.

39:31.872 --> 39:34.244
Not such a bad day after all.

39:35.167 --> 39:36.198
Hard call.

39:37.086 --> 39:39.078
But the right call.

39:39.922 --> 39:42.709
Have you ever counted up
the homes before?

39:44.260 --> 39:45.718
Thirty-seven.

39:46.220 --> 39:49.363
From the time he was 5
to the age of 18,

39:49.387 --> 39:53.862
he changed foster homes
every few weeks,

39:53.886 --> 39:56.766
and sometimes every few days.

39:57.731 --> 40:02.286
And the longest he ever stayed in one
place was with Alina Rostoff's family.

40:02.310 --> 40:03.565
Three months.

40:05.281 --> 40:09.089
I checked.
The, uh, parents died years ago.

40:09.113 --> 40:11.610
Alina stayed on with the house, so...

40:13.330 --> 40:14.682
Three months?

40:14.706 --> 40:17.199
Must have been something special.

40:19.503 --> 40:21.163
Don't you think?

40:32.433 --> 40:36.489
As I live and breathe, a convert.

40:36.513 --> 40:39.059
- I was tasting the paper.
- Ah.

40:39.773 --> 40:41.908
- Anything exotic?
- Just tea.

40:41.932 --> 40:45.395
Well, every journey
starts with a small step.

40:47.823 --> 40:49.567
From, uh, Arkady.

40:50.451 --> 40:53.238
Through back channels.

40:55.789 --> 40:56.789
Enjoy.

42:38.517 --> 42:39.548
Hi.
