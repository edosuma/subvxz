Greencrest. Battalion 1508.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.103
Edgewater Forest.

09:56.206 --> 09:58.137
We got a vehicle fire
spreading into the brush.

09:58.241 --> 10:00.551
About a 50-by-50 spot.
I'll be assuming IC.

10:00.655 --> 10:01.931
DISPATCHER:
Copy, Chief.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.413
You can contain this, right?We will do our best

10:03.517 --> 10:06.344
to protect the forest
around where you want to build.

10:06.448 --> 10:08.931
I meant my building
materials in there.

10:09.034 --> 10:12.103
It's lumber and pipe.
It's all brand-new.

10:12.206 --> 10:14.000
You left your running car
on dry grass.

10:14.103 --> 10:15.620
Not really worried
about your materials.

10:15.724 --> 10:17.137
I'm not worried
about you at all.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.482
I got a forest

10:18.586 --> 10:19.724
to try to save.

10:34.655 --> 10:35.586
So, what,
they keep lighting fires,

10:35.689 --> 10:36.620
we keep running to save 'em?

10:36.724 --> 10:37.724
We don't know

10:37.827 --> 10:39.068
that the protesters did this.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.862
It's two fires in the same place
on the same day.

10:40.965 --> 10:42.241
Our time should be
spent trying to help

10:42.344 --> 10:44.172
the people who didn't try
to kill us this morning.

10:44.275 --> 10:45.689
JAKE:
Hey, probie,

10:45.793 --> 10:48.137
it's frustrating, I get it,
but we go where the call is.

10:48.241 --> 10:49.517
We don't hesitate.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.448
We go.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.068
[alarm sounding]

10:58.275 --> 11:00.241
MAN [over radio]:
Fire's spread to an acre.

11:00.344 --> 11:01.586
[siren wailing] Requesting
additional water tenders.

11:01.689 --> 11:04.931
[indistinct radio transmission]

11:05.034 --> 11:07.310
Excellent response time, 42.

11:07.413 --> 11:08.655
All right, as you can see,

11:08.758 --> 11:10.034
we got a vehicle,
brush and trees

11:10.137 --> 11:12.000
all on fire
and spreading pretty fast.

11:12.103 --> 11:14.068
How did this one start?Wallace left his car running.

11:14.172 --> 11:16.827
Dry grass under the
catalytic converter.

11:16.931 --> 11:18.103
Eve, you're on the pump.

11:18.206 --> 11:19.931
Gabriela, Collin,
you're with me.

11:20.034 --> 11:21.965
I really thought the protesters
were behind this, too.

11:22.068 --> 11:24.931
I guess I was wrong.That's why we focus on the work.

11:25.034 --> 11:27.034
I sent a bunch of protesters
away from here.

11:27.137 --> 11:29.344
We got to evacuate anybody
who's still in there.

11:29.448 --> 11:30.827
Let's go.

11:30.931 --> 11:33.655
[indistinct radio transmission]

11:37.275 --> 11:39.241
DISPATCHER: Three Rock
Crew Four. Greencrest.

11:39.344 --> 11:41.827
Vegetation fire,
Edgewater Forest.

11:41.931 --> 11:44.517
Greencrest. Division 1501.
Assuming Edgewater IC.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.793
DC Leone,
where do you need us?

11:46.896 --> 11:48.448
Okay, I'm sending you
into Division Delta.

11:48.551 --> 11:50.310
You find Vince. He's gonna
give you an assignment.

11:50.413 --> 11:52.172
Copy that. All right,
Three Rock, with me!

11:52.275 --> 11:53.586
Okay, be safe.

11:53.689 --> 11:55.379
Let's roll!
Let's roll!

11:55.482 --> 11:57.517
Hey.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.862
Hey.

12:01.103 --> 12:03.586
Hey, you were right.
About?

12:03.689 --> 12:07.068
Focusing on the work.You see? That's the fun part.

12:07.172 --> 12:08.413
Winning.

12:08.517 --> 12:10.241
We're killing this fire!

12:12.103 --> 12:13.965
Looks like you've got this
pretty much handled?

12:14.068 --> 12:15.448
Damn good probies.

12:15.551 --> 12:18.448
They were trained
by the best.
True, true.

12:18.551 --> 12:20.551
Oh, wait. You mean me?

12:20.655 --> 12:22.275
I do. I have
seen you with them.

12:22.379 --> 12:25.620
And Chief Snow says you're
a real standout at IC training.

12:25.724 --> 12:26.965
You want to see
what it's really like

12:27.068 --> 12:28.896
at Incident Command today
and shadow me?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.172
Hell yeah!
Well, mm, sorry.

12:31.275 --> 12:32.551
Yes, Chief.

12:32.655 --> 12:34.758
Okay, find me
when you're done.

12:34.862 --> 12:37.034
[indistinct radio transmission]

12:41.620 --> 12:45.103
Everybody, we have
an active fire threat, so just

12:45.206 --> 12:48.517
stay calm,
follow the trail out.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.172
All this is gonna be gone.

12:51.275 --> 12:53.482
Ripped out
for a bunch of condos.

12:53.586 --> 12:55.586
CROWD [chanting]:
Hey, Wallace, get off it!Wait.

12:55.689 --> 12:57.586
This forest's not for profit!More protesters out here?

12:57.689 --> 12:59.413
Hey, Wallace, get off it!

12:59.517 --> 13:00.965
This forest's not for profit!

13:01.068 --> 13:02.931
Hey, Wallace, get off it!

13:03.034 --> 13:04.793
This forest's not for profit!

13:04.896 --> 13:06.448
Hey, Wallace, get off it!

13:06.551 --> 13:08.620
This forest's not for profit!Hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:08.724 --> 13:10.103
Everybody, I'm sorry.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.620
You got to evacuate right now.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.310
We're not going anywhere.

13:13.413 --> 13:16.413
You will, or else you're
gonna get eaten up by fire.

13:16.517 --> 13:19.931
Did Wallace pay you to tell us
that? Get us out of his way?

13:20.034 --> 13:21.655
It's not an excuse.

13:21.758 --> 13:24.758
Okay, so stop playing
with your Molotov cocktails and

13:24.862 --> 13:25.965
look up.

13:26.068 --> 13:28.689
TATUM:
Okay, that looks real.

13:28.793 --> 13:30.241
A car started
a grass fire.

13:30.344 --> 13:33.448
It's spreading fast, so, you can
get out now, you'll be fine.

13:33.551 --> 13:36.103
What about Tatum?
She's locked into that thing.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.724
Not my first sleeping dragon.
We will get her out.

13:37.827 --> 13:39.551
I promise. Okay, just go.

13:39.655 --> 13:40.896
Go! Everybody, go!

13:41.000 --> 13:42.241
[crowd murmuring]

13:42.344 --> 13:43.758
Sleeping dragon?

13:43.862 --> 13:46.551
Yeah, tricky little device

13:46.655 --> 13:49.896
designed for protesters who
don't want to be easily removed.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.172
Built her myself.

13:52.275 --> 13:54.034
Was hoping
a really disgruntled cop

13:54.137 --> 13:55.827
would have to take her apart.

13:55.931 --> 13:57.689
Or Wallace himself.

13:57.793 --> 14:01.310
Finally get an audience with
His Highness, the Weenie Weasel.

14:01.413 --> 14:02.896
All right, where's the key
to this lock?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.379
[sighs] It's in my
jacket pocket over here.

14:07.034 --> 14:09.655
Took me hours
to build this thing--

14:09.758 --> 14:14.034
duct tape, tar, mud.

14:14.137 --> 14:15.206
Oh, is that what I'm smelling?

14:15.310 --> 14:18.103
Oh, yeah. Again,
for Wallace.

14:18.206 --> 14:20.172
Hmm.What's that look?

14:20.275 --> 14:22.344
Wallace a friend of yours?

14:22.448 --> 14:26.379
No, and, look,
I get that you're upset

14:26.482 --> 14:29.206
and angry, but, listen,
that Molotov cocktail

14:29.310 --> 14:31.517
that you guys threw this morning
could have killed somebody.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.931
I didn't do that.
I'm nonviolent.

14:34.034 --> 14:37.965
I have to get creative,
like this.

14:38.068 --> 14:40.000
Yeah, handcuffs.

14:40.103 --> 14:42.137
That was my go-to
back in the day.

14:42.241 --> 14:44.137
You're a protester, too?

14:44.241 --> 14:46.896
I preferred the term
"demonstrator."

14:47.689 --> 14:49.275
Okay.

14:49.379 --> 14:52.275
All right, Tatum,
chains are off.

14:52.379 --> 14:54.103
Time to go.

14:54.931 --> 14:56.241
I can't.

14:56.344 --> 14:58.482
[groans]
This is not up for debate.

14:58.586 --> 15:00.034
No, I-I can't move.

15:00.137 --> 15:02.310
I'm zip-tied and chained

15:02.413 --> 15:04.310
to a carabiner
that's supposed to unclip

15:04.413 --> 15:06.931
from a bolt inside
and free me, but...

15:07.034 --> 15:09.000
Maybe I used
too much glue in here.

15:09.103 --> 15:10.517
It's not moving.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.965
Okay, okay, so we find
another way then, right?

15:13.068 --> 15:14.379
You don't understand.

15:14.482 --> 15:16.620
It's impossible
to dismantle quickly.

15:16.724 --> 15:17.862
That is the point.

15:17.965 --> 15:19.206
There's, like, a dozen features

15:19.310 --> 15:22.000
keeping me in this thing.

15:24.413 --> 15:27.068
VINCE:
We got a civilian trapped
in a sleeping dragon.

15:27.172 --> 15:29.413
We need extrication tools ASAP.

15:31.275 --> 15:33.551
Eve, as my shadow,
what would you do?

15:33.655 --> 15:35.758
Gabriela, Collin,

15:35.862 --> 15:37.275
take the med bag, blankets,

15:37.379 --> 15:40.172
extinguisher, and the grinder
to Vince's crew.

15:40.275 --> 15:41.482
Martin?
Yeah.

15:42.310 --> 15:43.896
Make sure the vehicle
is fully extinguished,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.034
and we'll wait
for the tow truck.

15:46.137 --> 15:49.000
They're on their way
to you, Vince.

15:49.103 --> 15:50.620
Clear communication.
That was good.

15:50.724 --> 15:52.793
You know, I-I can
manage a car fire,

15:52.896 --> 15:54.862
but manning a whole incident?

15:54.965 --> 15:56.896
Just keep assessing
the whole situation.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.413
What's going on
with the fire?

15:58.517 --> 16:01.896
What's going on
with the people?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.655
We got an angry developer

16:03.758 --> 16:05.137
and protesters.

16:05.241 --> 16:07.551
They could complicate
this in a minute.

16:08.724 --> 16:10.103
What's going on
with the car?

16:10.206 --> 16:11.448
Reignition? How?

16:11.551 --> 16:12.965
Okay, first thing
about leadership is

16:13.068 --> 16:14.413
delegation. Come here!

16:22.827 --> 16:25.448
JAKE:
Can't we just cut this in half?

16:25.551 --> 16:26.965
VINCE:
Through all these layers
of materials?

16:27.068 --> 16:29.034
Our saw can't handle that.

16:29.137 --> 16:31.379
Chicken wire.
That's a nice touch.

16:31.482 --> 16:35.206
Yeah, I thought so, too...
at the time.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.586
MAN [over radio]:
Fiery ignition, rapid spread,

16:36.689 --> 16:38.655
headed in your direction.

16:39.655 --> 16:41.379
[sighs]

16:41.482 --> 16:44.965
So, Eve told me that, uh,
Bode has to go back to prison

16:45.068 --> 16:46.758
to recover
from the kidney transplant?

16:46.862 --> 16:49.413
Yup. I don't like it either.

16:49.517 --> 16:52.862
Well, what if he loses his spot
at Three Rock?

16:52.965 --> 16:54.931
Or fire camp entirely?

16:55.034 --> 16:56.965
Uh, what if he backslides
while he's gone?

16:57.068 --> 17:00.586
Jake, if there was...
if there was any other option.

17:00.689 --> 17:03.931
I mean, I wish I was a match,
I wish

17:04.034 --> 17:06.482
anybody else was
a match, but I...

17:06.586 --> 17:08.689
I'm a match.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.655
I found out after
Sharon's kidney-raiser.

17:11.758 --> 17:13.827
Look, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm...
I'm sorry.

17:13.931 --> 17:17.205
Seriously, I-I'm sorry that
I didn't tell you sooner.

17:17.310 --> 17:19.413
Chief, I was scared.

17:20.241 --> 17:22.964
It's a scary decision to make.

17:23.068 --> 17:25.378
No reason to apologize.

17:25.482 --> 17:28.103
Chief, I don't want
to steal Bode's thunder.

17:29.896 --> 17:31.413
But I know Sharon needs a...

17:31.517 --> 17:33.620
she needs a kidney, and...

17:33.724 --> 17:35.482
well, I-I-I think
it would kill her more

17:35.586 --> 17:37.758
if she lost Bode again, and...

17:37.862 --> 17:40.724
What are you trying to say?

17:40.827 --> 17:44.137
I know I have to go through all
the official channels still,

17:44.241 --> 17:46.551
but... pick me.

17:46.655 --> 17:51.172
Chief, let me be
Sharon's kidney donor.

17:51.965 --> 17:54.068
Dude, are you serious right now?

18:03.241 --> 18:04.931
You're trying
to make moves around me

18:05.034 --> 18:06.275
like I'm some kind of child?

18:06.379 --> 18:07.413
Bode, I'm sorry
you found out like this.

18:07.517 --> 18:09.344
I'm doing this, Jake. Back off.

18:09.448 --> 18:10.689
Bode, hear me out.

18:10.793 --> 18:12.689
Firefighters,
now's not the time.

18:12.793 --> 18:15.655
Chief's right.
Tell us where to go.

18:15.758 --> 18:17.379
Have your crew
start cutting line

18:17.482 --> 18:19.379
around all this lumber
and machinery.

18:19.482 --> 18:21.413
The fire gets here,
it's gonna be the first to go.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.482
Yes, sir. All right,
half of you boys with me,

18:23.586 --> 18:26.103
the other half with Bode
over there. Let's go.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.241
[indistinct radio transmission]

18:27.344 --> 18:30.241
What's going on?

18:31.689 --> 18:32.931
VINCE:Probies,

18:33.034 --> 18:34.206
go join Three Rock.
Start cutting line.

18:34.310 --> 18:35.896
All hands on deck.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.758
Let's go. Jake.

18:38.586 --> 18:41.310
Grab equipment.
Let's get to work.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.793
This is a hybrid,
which I must have missed

18:48.896 --> 18:50.724
because the insignia is
charred, but... [scoffs]

18:50.827 --> 18:52.965
I should've done a better job
with the assessment.No, no, no.

18:53.068 --> 18:55.379
There's no need to wallow when
there's other work to be done.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.206
Just walk me through it.

18:57.310 --> 19:00.000
Okay. Once the batteries
heat up, the heat travels

19:00.103 --> 19:01.482
from one cell to another,

19:01.586 --> 19:03.379
reigniting the battery
over and over again.

19:03.482 --> 19:05.137
It's kind of like
a trick candle.

19:05.241 --> 19:06.655
You never know
when it's gonna stop.

19:06.758 --> 19:08.310
Okay, so we're gonna
need more water.

19:08.413 --> 19:11.344
I can ping dispatch
for another water tender.

19:11.448 --> 19:13.586
Or maybe I have
a better idea.

19:13.689 --> 19:16.344
We need the jaws.No... ho-ho-ho-ho...

19:17.448 --> 19:19.413
Right. Delegate.

19:19.517 --> 19:22.000
You two, we need
the jaws, ASAP.

19:22.103 --> 19:23.000
All right.

19:23.103 --> 19:25.517
That was good, Eve.

19:26.517 --> 19:28.068
MAN: You got it?MAN 2: Yeah.

19:28.896 --> 19:30.931
All right, Tatum,
you're gonna guide us.

19:31.034 --> 19:32.413
You know your dragon best.

19:32.517 --> 19:34.758
The bolt's over here
on my left side.

19:34.862 --> 19:37.724
Under the chicken wire
are layers of tubing,

19:37.827 --> 19:40.379
more chicken wire,
and then mesh under that.

19:40.482 --> 19:42.724
And a skin irritant, tar.

19:42.827 --> 19:47.517
And... I know this must
all sound crazy to you.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.827
No.

19:49.931 --> 19:53.827
I got arrested 35 years ago
in this same forest.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.413
Pipeline protest.

19:55.517 --> 19:57.620
I wouldn't leave either.

19:57.724 --> 20:00.655
You and Bode--
so set on something, you can't

20:00.758 --> 20:03.068
see another way
to do it.
Jake.

20:03.172 --> 20:06.275
It seems like you all care
a lot about each other.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.965
People fight when they care.

20:09.068 --> 20:10.655
I fought with my parents

20:10.758 --> 20:13.344
when they sold their
construction company to Wallace.

20:13.448 --> 20:15.344
He's ruthless
for a bottom line,

20:15.448 --> 20:17.413
no matter how many
trees he kills.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.000
My family loves these trees.

20:20.103 --> 20:22.206
Here I am,

20:22.310 --> 20:24.517
trying to save
what they couldn't.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.137
Yeah, well,
isn't saving trees antithetical

20:27.241 --> 20:29.448
to construction?

20:30.241 --> 20:32.275
My parents practiced
sustainable forestry.

20:32.379 --> 20:34.724
They balanced what
was best for the trees

20:34.827 --> 20:37.586
and the people
and the wildlife.

20:37.689 --> 20:40.413
People need housing.
I'm not denying that.

20:40.517 --> 20:42.965
There's just a better way
to do it, huh?

20:43.068 --> 20:45.206
A less destructive way.

20:59.206 --> 21:01.172
What happened earlier?

21:01.275 --> 21:02.827
Nothing.

21:02.931 --> 21:07.000
You and Jake were just shooting
each other daggers over nothing?

21:10.586 --> 21:13.965
Are you really just gonna
shut me out after...

21:14.068 --> 21:17.137
what happened after the
last fire we worked together?

21:17.241 --> 21:19.689
After we kissed?

21:27.517 --> 21:29.310
Bode, you want
to better yourself?

21:29.413 --> 21:31.689
You want to make the rest
of your sentence count

21:31.793 --> 21:34.413
so that, by the time you get out
of here, you are solid?

21:34.517 --> 21:37.413
And we can be together?

21:40.793 --> 21:43.793
Talk to me.

21:49.068 --> 21:51.586
I thought Jake and I were
in a better place.

21:53.034 --> 21:54.758
But it's like... it's like

21:54.862 --> 21:56.931
he can't stop
taking things from me.

21:58.241 --> 22:01.931
This was the one thing
that I could do for my mom.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.862
Jake's a kidney match, too.

22:06.965 --> 22:09.068
And that's bad?

22:09.172 --> 22:13.551
Well, if the transplant board
is deciding between me and Jake,

22:13.655 --> 22:16.206
who do you think
they're gonna pick?

22:16.310 --> 22:18.965
Well, all things equal,

22:19.068 --> 22:20.965
your mom has the final say.

22:21.068 --> 22:22.793
Yeah.

22:22.896 --> 22:24.517
But all things aren't equal,
are they?

22:24.620 --> 22:26.827
Hey, Ja-Jake's
in perfect health.

22:26.931 --> 22:29.482
He's never done drugs,
he's not incarcerated.

22:30.379 --> 22:32.724
He's the one to pick.

22:36.482 --> 22:38.689
I disagree.

22:48.068 --> 22:49.689
EVE:
The battery's
burning underneath.

22:49.793 --> 22:51.241
We got to attack
this from below.

22:51.344 --> 22:52.517
SHARON:
Walk them through it,
and be specific.

22:52.620 --> 22:54.758
Add more chase cribbing!

22:54.862 --> 22:56.758
Faster, Olsen. I've seen
you race to the front

22:56.862 --> 22:59.068
of the lunch line. Good
work, guys. Open the jaws.

22:59.172 --> 23:01.965
Slide the cribbing. Nice.

23:03.103 --> 23:04.586
Bring it down.Okay.

23:04.689 --> 23:05.689
[indistinct shouting]

23:05.793 --> 23:07.655
[indistinct radio transmission]

23:07.758 --> 23:09.344
Put the water up
under the truck!

23:09.448 --> 23:11.000
Attack the battery dead-on.

23:11.103 --> 23:13.000
Hit those sparks.

23:13.103 --> 23:15.034
Nice, y'all. Good.

23:15.137 --> 23:17.655
You got a straight shot
to the battery.

23:17.758 --> 23:19.655
Now, the water can cool it
even faster.

23:19.758 --> 23:21.586
This is really thinking
outside the box.

23:21.689 --> 23:23.551
This is leadership. Come on.

23:23.655 --> 23:25.448
I'm gonna update Chief Snow
on your progress.

23:25.551 --> 23:26.758
Really good work.

23:26.862 --> 23:28.827
[indistinct radio transmission]

23:28.931 --> 23:31.275
Do you ever, um,
miss being in the thick of it?

23:31.379 --> 23:33.275
WALLACE:
Chief Leone?

23:33.379 --> 23:34.689
SHARON:
Okay, here we go.

23:34.793 --> 23:36.620
This is gonna be
the next lesson in leadership.

23:36.724 --> 23:39.000
This is on diplomacy.

23:39.103 --> 23:40.586
Just watch and learn.

23:40.689 --> 23:43.551
Hey, look who it is--
my friend Neil.

23:43.655 --> 23:45.068
Friends was
when you were helping me

23:45.172 --> 23:47.275
with my groundbreaking,
not letting it burn.

23:47.379 --> 23:48.965
I'm not letting it burn.

23:49.068 --> 23:50.689
You need to do something to
protect my building materials.

23:50.793 --> 23:55.000
I am losing houses for people,
and if I lose that,

23:55.103 --> 23:57.344
you might lose my donation
to Cal Fire.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.586
What? They're recording me?

24:01.689 --> 24:03.275
Yeah, 'cause they think
you're gonna lose it

24:03.379 --> 24:06.241
and maybe start spewing
obscenities at a firefighter.

24:06.344 --> 24:08.551
And that would not be
a good look if you're looking

24:08.655 --> 24:10.000
for the department's
seal of approval

24:10.103 --> 24:12.931
for this development,
now, is it?

24:20.965 --> 24:22.896
I almost lost it
on that guy.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.068
Diplomacy's a skill,
like everything else.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.655
You practice, and
you get better at it.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.655
Neil's a bit
of a trick candle, too.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.137
You need to keep an eye
out for reignition.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.448
Um...

24:38.896 --> 24:41.758
What are you gonna do
that makes me need these?

24:41.862 --> 24:43.758
Well, we're gonna cut
into the, uh, tube

24:43.862 --> 24:45.620
so that I can unjam
your carabiner,

24:45.724 --> 24:47.448
but it'll throw off sparks.

24:47.551 --> 24:49.103
Tell us if you feel heat.

24:49.206 --> 24:51.620
You know, it sounds flammable,
near this beautiful tree

24:51.724 --> 24:53.448
and also my face.

24:53.551 --> 24:57.344
Hey, how did your family make
that housing development work?

24:57.448 --> 24:59.137
Sustainably?

24:59.241 --> 25:01.689
[saw buzzing]Um, tree preservation, for one.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.379
We could save more trees.

25:03.482 --> 25:05.068
VINCE:Building houses
in the middle of a forest--

25:05.172 --> 25:08.482
that's a wildland-urban
interface disaster.

25:08.586 --> 25:10.862
TATUM:Uh, we would build with plenty
of defensible space

25:10.965 --> 25:13.758
around the condos.
Ah! Something's hot!

25:13.862 --> 25:15.172
VINCE:
Hey, hey, stop the saw.

25:15.275 --> 25:16.793
[groans]Friction's
heating up the tube.

25:16.896 --> 25:18.965
Yeah.
We got
to cool her down

25:19.068 --> 25:20.344
with some water.

25:20.448 --> 25:22.068
Yeah. Hey, no offense,but, uh,

25:22.172 --> 25:24.379
did you ever think about writing
any of this in a letter?

25:24.482 --> 25:27.655
Letters, voice mails, emails,
all unanswered.

25:27.758 --> 25:30.000
He won't hear me out.

25:31.793 --> 25:34.241
Guess this guy really is
a weenie weasel.

25:34.344 --> 25:35.551
Hmm.

25:35.655 --> 25:38.310
Fire's getting closer.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.068
We got to hustle.

25:40.896 --> 25:43.758
All right, you're good.All right.

25:46.172 --> 25:48.172
[grunting]

25:51.344 --> 25:54.310
Hey, go grab some water,
take a break.No, no.

25:54.413 --> 25:57.034
I'm good. I can keep up.

25:57.137 --> 25:59.965
We have a lot to prove
as probies, I get it.

26:00.068 --> 26:03.517
But right now, if you go down,
we've got two people to save,

26:03.620 --> 26:06.517
so...

26:06.620 --> 26:07.931
Aah!You okay?

26:08.034 --> 26:10.758
You all right?Something burned me.

26:17.482 --> 26:19.034
Yo, we got fire over here.

26:20.827 --> 26:22.068
Hey, Chief!

26:22.172 --> 26:23.551
Fire's not on its way.

26:23.655 --> 26:25.586
It's here.

26:27.310 --> 26:29.206
Let's go, Three Rock!

26:33.758 --> 26:35.103
VINCE:
Spot fires are popping off.

26:35.206 --> 26:36.793
This lumber's going up.
We need a hose line.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.793
We're not gonna wait for that.
Let's go, Three Rock!

26:38.896 --> 26:40.379
Let's go!
Let's get these spot fires out!

26:40.482 --> 26:42.344
We can do this!

26:42.448 --> 26:45.931
Use your Pulaskis!
Bring down those 2x4s.

26:46.034 --> 26:48.137
Come on, let's move that
into the black, all right?

26:48.241 --> 26:49.655
Hit 'em with dirt!

26:49.758 --> 26:51.206
It's gonna take
more dirt than that.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.344
Come on, guys,
let's move, move.

26:54.344 --> 26:57.689
Hey! Hey, we could use
some extra hands over here!

26:57.793 --> 26:59.241
Oh, wait! Gab! Gab!

26:59.344 --> 27:01.206
Gab, I-I've never fought fires
with only hand tools before.

27:01.310 --> 27:04.034
Just follow Bode's lead.
He's a nugget, too, remember?

27:04.137 --> 27:06.000
We look out for each other!

27:06.103 --> 27:08.103
I promise
I'm not as fast as her.Okay.

27:08.206 --> 27:10.137
All right, we're pulling these
on the count of three, come on.

27:10.241 --> 27:11.965
One. Two.

27:12.068 --> 27:13.344
Three.

27:15.896 --> 27:17.620
Come on, over there.

27:19.275 --> 27:20.413
All right.

27:20.517 --> 27:23.172
Little more, more, little more.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.034
Keep going, keep going.

27:25.137 --> 27:26.655
[indistinct radio transmission]

27:26.758 --> 27:29.137
Any more reignitions?Nothing for a while.

27:29.241 --> 27:30.827
Think the battery's
cooled off finally.

27:30.931 --> 27:32.448
Okay, Vince is asking
for a hose.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.482
The fire has reached them.
Who do you want to send in?

27:34.586 --> 27:36.310
Martin.

27:36.413 --> 27:37.620
Grab a hose pack!

27:37.724 --> 27:39.241
And, uh...

27:40.275 --> 27:42.793
I'm going, too.

27:43.655 --> 27:45.448
Incident Command doesn't go in.

27:45.551 --> 27:47.241
We stay out here and we oversee.

27:47.344 --> 27:49.689
Then maybe
Incident Command isn't for me.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.413
I've barely touched
a hose all day,

27:51.517 --> 27:53.655
and I'm crawling out of my skin.

27:55.172 --> 27:58.482
Thank you, Chief, for the
opportunity, but I'm going, too.

27:58.586 --> 28:00.206
Let's go!

28:02.620 --> 28:04.862
Be safe, girl.

28:07.379 --> 28:09.379
There's the nozzle.

28:09.482 --> 28:10.758
Hose here!

28:10.862 --> 28:12.896
I need the clamp.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Yep.

28:15.275 --> 28:18.068
Let's add another stick of hose.Here you go.

28:21.172 --> 28:23.206
Stitch it in.
Coupling.

28:27.275 --> 28:28.275
Fancy.

28:29.448 --> 28:31.724
Clamp. Hose clamped.

28:32.620 --> 28:33.862
Okay.

28:34.655 --> 28:36.655
[flames whooshing]

28:36.758 --> 28:39.206
[sighs]
Crap. That's not good.

28:41.482 --> 28:43.379
Chief, fire's hungry
and moving your way.

28:43.482 --> 28:45.034
VINCE:
How soon
till the hose gets here?

28:45.137 --> 28:46.724
We're moving as fast as we can.

28:46.827 --> 28:48.172
Almost there.

28:49.724 --> 28:51.448
We're connected.
Ready for water.

28:51.551 --> 28:53.862
Water's coming.

28:53.965 --> 28:55.689
Line's charged.

28:55.793 --> 28:57.310
Advancing the line.

28:57.413 --> 29:02.068
Send Engine 1557 to join the
task force on Division Alpha.

29:02.172 --> 29:04.206
Greencrest,
this is Edgewater IC.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.275
Requesting a water drop
to Division Delta.

29:06.379 --> 29:08.517
We've got a surface fire
encroaching on our crews

29:08.620 --> 29:10.034
and a trapped civilian.

29:10.137 --> 29:11.689
DISPATCHER:
Nearest copter is 263.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.862
They're 30 minutes out.

29:13.965 --> 29:16.241
Copy. 30 minutes out.

29:17.068 --> 29:19.103
Okay, I just need you
to stay calm.

29:19.206 --> 29:20.758
Is there any news on Tatum?

29:20.862 --> 29:22.206
Looks like the fire's
getting worse.

29:22.310 --> 29:24.034
We're not sure yet.Chief, my lumber
is in there.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.517
You should have thought
about that

29:25.620 --> 29:27.068
before you left your car
running on dry grass.

29:27.172 --> 29:29.241
Wait. You caused this?!Whoa!

29:29.344 --> 29:30.896
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
That's not gonna help anything.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.965
Tatum's in there.

29:33.068 --> 29:36.000
She's stuck around a tree,
trapped by a fire you started.

29:36.103 --> 29:38.965
Tatum? Tatum Morgan?

29:40.965 --> 29:43.206
I bought this company
off of her parents.

29:43.310 --> 29:46.482
She-She's emailed me
every day since.

29:46.586 --> 29:47.827
If you had just heard her out,

29:47.931 --> 29:49.448
she wouldn't be
in there right now.

29:51.241 --> 29:53.448
You can get her out, right?

29:53.551 --> 29:54.793
You need to back up.

29:54.896 --> 29:57.103
You need to let us
do our work here.

29:59.827 --> 30:00.931
[indistinct chatter]

30:01.034 --> 30:02.586
MANNY:
Hey, Three Rock!

30:02.689 --> 30:04.793
Let's move these tanks
out of the way, all right?

30:04.896 --> 30:06.413
Get it away
from this skid steer.

30:06.517 --> 30:08.034
It's full of fuel.

30:08.137 --> 30:09.655
If it gets close to it,
it's a possible explosion.

30:09.758 --> 30:11.310
Let's move.

30:13.965 --> 30:16.310
Chief, I'm here!

30:16.413 --> 30:18.310
Drown the hot spots.

30:18.413 --> 30:20.620
Window's open. I just got
to get through this mesh

30:20.724 --> 30:22.310
once I get the bolt off.

30:22.413 --> 30:24.862
That's a good thing, right?Means you're almost out of here.

30:24.965 --> 30:26.827
Eve, how far away
is our ground fire?

30:26.931 --> 30:29.172
Assuming the winds don't change,
ten minutes.

30:29.275 --> 30:32.034
All right, Jake,
we need her out of here in five.

30:32.137 --> 30:34.517
Copy.Everybody else,
start packing up.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.034
Soon as Tatum is extricated,

30:36.137 --> 30:37.931
we're out of here
before we get trapped.

30:38.034 --> 30:39.275
Copy that, Chief.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.965
All right, Three Rock,
let's move!

30:41.068 --> 30:42.655
Single file, right behind me.
Go, go, go!

30:42.758 --> 30:45.448
Wait. You're-you're just gonna
leave and let the trees burn?!

30:45.551 --> 30:47.206
Tatum, it's not safe anymore.

30:47.310 --> 30:50.379
These trees matter
to me, to this town.

30:50.482 --> 30:51.793
We have to protect them!

30:51.896 --> 30:54.724
I didn't put myself
in danger just to give up!

30:54.827 --> 30:56.172
We can't give up!

30:56.275 --> 30:57.931
Hi. Hey, what about
these fire blankets?

30:58.034 --> 30:59.482
What if we tied 'em
around the trunks?

30:59.586 --> 31:01.413
Well, how would that work?

31:01.517 --> 31:02.931
This fire's creeping
around real low.

31:03.034 --> 31:04.310
It might rip through here
on the ground.

31:04.413 --> 31:06.172
But if the trees are
wrapped in fire blankets,

31:06.275 --> 31:08.413
they-they have a shot
at staying intact.

31:08.517 --> 31:11.000
I get it, but the trees
are not the priority right now.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.137
Hey, you wanted him
to hear you out.

31:13.241 --> 31:16.482
Hear his plan out
now, please.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.275
Okay, but you heard the chief.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.275
She's out of here
in five minutes.

31:23.379 --> 31:25.448
Jake, it's feeling
warm again.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.758
I'm not even using the saw
anymore.

31:27.862 --> 31:30.068
It's not the dragon.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.931
What do we do first? Do we
put out the fire or save Tatum?

31:46.034 --> 31:48.206
Both. Always both.

31:48.310 --> 31:50.310
Permission to move
on this fire blanket plan, Cap?

31:50.413 --> 31:52.965
You do what you can
with the remaining time,

31:53.068 --> 31:54.551
but once she's free, we move.

31:54.655 --> 31:56.172
Yeah.

32:00.103 --> 32:03.655
Hey. Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

32:03.758 --> 32:05.482
Thanks.

32:05.586 --> 32:08.068
How much longer?

32:08.172 --> 32:10.172
Yeah, I'm cutting
as fast as I can.

32:10.275 --> 32:13.000
All right, Three Rock, let's
help Bode wrap these trees.

32:14.793 --> 32:16.551
So, you're a tree hugger, huh?

32:16.655 --> 32:18.965
You saw how much she cares
about saving these trees.

32:19.068 --> 32:20.482
She'd be devastated
if she loses all of 'em.

32:20.586 --> 32:22.896
MANNY:
Grab webbing
and ratchet straps.

32:23.931 --> 32:25.000
Work together, guys.

32:25.103 --> 32:26.000
[indistinct shouting]

32:26.103 --> 32:27.137
You guys good?

32:27.241 --> 32:28.482
Watch each other's backs.

32:28.586 --> 32:30.655
Secure the blankets
at the top and the bottom.

32:31.827 --> 32:34.068
This tree's about to go!

32:35.000 --> 32:36.034
Please hurry.

32:36.137 --> 32:37.482
VINCE:
We got to get in there.

32:37.586 --> 32:39.379
Chief, cutting the wire
is taking too long.

32:39.482 --> 32:40.827
Uh, you have pliers?

32:40.931 --> 32:42.965
Okay. Pry this open right here.

32:43.068 --> 32:45.931
I'm gonna reach in and try
to unclip the carabiner.Got it.

32:46.034 --> 32:48.965
Yup, yup,
that's good, okay.

32:50.724 --> 32:52.827
[Jake groans]

32:52.931 --> 32:53.862
Damn it, the clip's stuck.

32:53.965 --> 32:55.103
Grab the bolt cutters.

32:55.206 --> 32:57.310
We'll just cut the chain.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.965
Okay. Give me that.

33:02.137 --> 33:03.551
Yeah, I got it.

33:03.655 --> 33:05.586
There she is.All right, she's free.

33:05.689 --> 33:07.034
Let's go! Let's go!

33:07.137 --> 33:08.448
All right, Three Rock, let's go!

33:08.551 --> 33:10.655
Let's go! Move!
Double time! Double time!

33:10.758 --> 33:12.172
We're losing our escape route,
and we don't have

33:12.275 --> 33:14.310
enough resources
to hold off a fire that size.

33:14.413 --> 33:16.379
Bode. You, too.Yup.

33:16.482 --> 33:18.517
Yeah, I know. I'm done.Let's go! Let's go!

33:20.344 --> 33:22.551
Thank you
for saving my trees.

33:22.655 --> 33:24.344
I'm sorry that you couldn't
be the one to do it.

33:24.448 --> 33:27.517
I don't care who got the save.
It's about them, not me.

33:42.379 --> 33:43.620
Doug!

33:43.724 --> 33:44.965
Tatum!

33:45.896 --> 33:48.068
You're okay!I'm good.

33:48.172 --> 33:50.965
[indistinct radio transmission]

33:53.517 --> 33:55.000
What's our next assignment?

33:55.103 --> 33:57.068
The strike team just
arrived to tag you out.

33:57.172 --> 33:58.758
They'll take it from here.

33:58.862 --> 34:02.344
Be honest, how much did you geek
out over that sleeping dragon?

34:02.448 --> 34:04.206
Not as much as I would have

34:04.310 --> 34:06.482
if the tree
she was hugging wasn't on fire.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.413
[laughing]How about you?

34:08.516 --> 34:10.034
You've been fangirling
over your buddy Neil?

34:10.137 --> 34:12.757
Okay, lemonade out
of lemons, Vince.

34:12.862 --> 34:16.103
You know, part of my job is
to make difficult compromises.

34:16.206 --> 34:19.068
Well, you feel like
making one more?

34:19.172 --> 34:22.275
Because Tatum wants
to talk to him.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.344
I think I can
make that happen.

34:28.241 --> 34:29.585
What are you doing?

34:29.688 --> 34:31.896
You know, their demands
are a little bit

34:32.000 --> 34:33.620
like a hybrid car fire.

34:33.724 --> 34:36.551
They're not going to stop
until you think outside the box.

34:36.655 --> 34:38.585
Like what?

34:40.688 --> 34:42.241
TATUM:Now you're ready
to listen, Weasel?

34:42.344 --> 34:44.413
Why don't you get
your cameras ready?

34:46.965 --> 34:49.931
Uh...

34:50.034 --> 34:52.034
Neil Wallace here.

34:52.137 --> 34:54.585
The Weasel.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.482
I am sorry
for ignoring the demands

34:58.586 --> 35:01.482
of this passionate group
of individuals.

35:01.586 --> 35:06.000
And I'm sorry for how my actions
led to today's events.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.689
TATUM:
Sustainable forestry

35:07.793 --> 35:09.034
is the only way.

35:09.137 --> 35:10.379
I'm here now to listen.

35:10.482 --> 35:12.482
We can build houses
and save trees.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.724
Hey, Bode.

35:26.827 --> 35:29.965
Hey, I know it's complicated
between you guys,

35:30.068 --> 35:33.965
but I think he's just looking
out for you and for Sharon.

35:34.793 --> 35:37.517
And if you wanted him
to back off, I know he would.

35:41.655 --> 35:44.931
Oh, I, uh... I didn't get
a chance to say it earlier,

35:45.034 --> 35:47.620
but, um, happy birthday.

35:48.620 --> 35:51.206
Thanks.

35:53.413 --> 35:55.103
Hey.

35:55.206 --> 35:58.517
It-It's your birthday?

35:58.620 --> 36:00.827
Yeah.

36:00.931 --> 36:04.206
Why didn't you say anything?

36:05.827 --> 36:08.517
Guess I've been focused
on other things today.

Oh, nice shot.

36:36.586 --> 36:39.172
Hey, want to grab
a few more at Smokey's?

36:39.275 --> 36:40.862
Like maybe, like,
a-a basket of onion rings?

36:40.965 --> 36:44.551
Uh, can we rain check?
I'm kind of busy.

36:44.655 --> 36:46.413
Yeah, of course.

36:46.517 --> 36:48.827
Great.
Uh, also,

36:48.931 --> 36:50.793
uh, I just...

36:50.896 --> 36:53.689
I wanted to thank you
for the tip.

36:54.793 --> 36:57.172
You know, to focus on the work.

36:57.275 --> 37:00.344
Uh, some people are distracting,
aren't they?

37:00.448 --> 37:02.413
What do you mean?

37:03.241 --> 37:05.068
Uh, you and Bode?

37:05.172 --> 37:08.034
I mean, if anything happens
between you and him...

37:08.137 --> 37:09.724
It hasn't.

37:09.827 --> 37:13.137
I know. I'm just saying, both
of you could get in big trouble.

37:13.241 --> 37:16.310
Especially you,
so just be careful.

37:16.413 --> 37:19.724
We nuggets--
we got to stick together, right?

37:23.000 --> 37:23.896
See you later.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.413
Thanks, you, too.

37:29.137 --> 37:31.137
Hey, what you doing?

37:31.241 --> 37:34.724
Hey. I'm trying

37:34.827 --> 37:37.724
to find something that resembles
a birthday cake for Bode.

37:37.827 --> 37:40.448
And I think... I just found it.

37:40.551 --> 37:43.413
Hey! Birthday chicken!

37:43.517 --> 37:45.655
[laughing]Mmm.

37:45.758 --> 37:47.068
Well, I...

37:47.172 --> 37:50.103
It's either this or...
or nothing.Right.

37:50.206 --> 37:51.965
You know, you're a very good,

37:52.068 --> 37:55.344

37:56.172 --> 38:00.068
You know, I think I blew my shot
trying to impress DC Leone.

38:00.172 --> 38:02.137
What happened?

38:02.241 --> 38:05.310
Well, she invited me to tag
along, and I sort of hated it.

38:05.413 --> 38:07.965
So I kind of just left.

38:08.793 --> 38:11.758
Oh, y-you might have blown it.

38:12.586 --> 38:15.689

to career goals, I guess. Yeah.

I mean, Incident Command might
not be your cup of firefighting.

to tell you

38:25.655 --> 38:27.379
that you want something else.

Hmm. Come on.

to rotisserie chicken.

38:40.931 --> 38:43.137
Looks a little dry.

♪ Oh, I ♪

41:28.862 --> 41:31.965

41:32.965 --> 41:35.448
[sighs]

41:35.551 --> 41:38.137
Yeah, you should've
come to me first.

41:38.241 --> 41:40.620
Instead of going
behind my back to my dad.

41:40.724 --> 41:44.000
I wasn't trying to pull
anything, Bode. I just...

41:46.724 --> 41:49.965
I'm trying to keep you
from going back to prison, B.

41:51.137 --> 41:53.137
Your mom needs you here.

41:53.241 --> 41:55.827
So does your dad.

41:58.655 --> 42:01.241
Plus, it's been good
having you back.

42:05.793 --> 42:08.517
It's been good for me, too.

42:08.620 --> 42:10.724
My life's hard enough.

42:10.827 --> 42:12.310
I shouldn't do anything

42:12.413 --> 42:14.517
that's gonna jeopardize
all the progress that I've made.

42:14.620 --> 42:18.689
So, if... if you're game...

42:19.931 --> 42:23.344
...and my mom's still okay
with it,

42:23.448 --> 42:25.758
you should be her donor.

42:26.655 --> 42:29.034
I made this about me.

42:29.137 --> 42:31.241
You know,
thinking I-I needed this

42:31.344 --> 42:34.034
to make up for my past mistakes.

42:37.965 --> 42:40.724
But my mom is what I care about.

42:43.379 --> 42:45.655
I just want her to live.

42:47.517 --> 42:49.758
Doesn't matter who saves her.

42:53.655 --> 42:56.620
So, what? Turning 30 has got you
level-headed now?

42:58.241 --> 43:00.310
Shut up, man.

43:05.206 --> 43:07.620
Thank you, Jake.

43:07.724 --> 43:09.586
Always, brother.
