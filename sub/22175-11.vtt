16:52.077 --> 16:53.512
- That was a smart choice.

{\an8}- I'm running out of time.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.448
{\an8}I had to make some
changes to the tattoo.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.150
I'm trying to keep my cool,
but I have chills going down

16:58.217 --> 17:00.152
my spine looking at Ria Rabitt
tattoo right now.

17:00.219 --> 17:01.820
She's pulling out
all the stops.

17:01.887 --> 17:04.390
She's not holding back.
I taught this girl well.

17:04.455 --> 17:07.358
- I was gonna do
a purple background.

17:07.425 --> 17:08.761
That's why I
have the purple out.

17:08.827 --> 17:09.962
It wouldn't be too much.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.597
It would be like hints.

17:11.663 --> 17:16.001

one of the Angels so bad,

to stack up against the best.

Vampires are sexy.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.866
The way that
I stacked them in there

I just wanted to push it

I'm worthy of going up

18:27.473 --> 18:28.640

palette you chose.

The blacks and the reds
and the oranges and the yellows

18:33.412 --> 18:35.848
are really nice,
and it works well together.

18:35.914 --> 18:39.351
- Where it loses it for me
is that hand.

18:39.418 --> 18:41.487
That dark shading got away from
you,

18:41.553 --> 18:43.322
because now it's a little tough

18:43.388 --> 18:47.392
to distinguish the hand
from the cross from the hair,

18:47.459 --> 18:50.162
because it's a lot
of dark on dark on dark.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.997
- The bad part of that,
I see it now.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.999
- Did you use any
reference for this tattoo?

18:54.066 --> 18:55.534
- It's a custom drawing
that I did myself.

18:55.601 --> 18:58.670
No reference. I wanted
to give you 100% DeVille.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.606
There's no bull[bleep].
There's no nothing.

19:00.672 --> 19:03.642
- There's, like, no shame in
using reference as an artist,

19:03.709 --> 19:06.979
because you're gonna
get a better tattoo out of it.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.114

19:09.181 --> 19:10.249
- Hey, ladies.
- Hey, hey.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.717
- Tell us about this.

19:11.783 --> 19:14.052
- I chose this tattoo,
because I love to do color.

19:14.119 --> 19:15.888
- I want to say, I think
it's obnoxiously bright,

19:15.954 --> 19:17.456
and I love that.
- Thank you.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.625
- The fact that you chose
a hairless cat is really cool.

19:19.691 --> 19:23.962
You get to show a lot of the
textures in that wrinkly skin.

19:24.029 --> 19:28.100
- What I love most
about this tattoo is this black

19:28.166 --> 19:29.468
and how it contrasts against

19:29.535 --> 19:30.836
your beautifully
saturated color.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.404
And I wish that you
brought some of that

19:32.471 --> 19:33.539
more into the rest
of the tattoo.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.007
- Okay.

19:35.073 --> 19:38.110
- If you had brought just
a little bit of darker tone

19:38.176 --> 19:40.913
through the flower,
you could've created more

19:40.979 --> 19:44.883
of these nice shadows
up against those petals.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.619
- Something to remember
that we learned was that,

19:47.686 --> 19:49.888
even in photorealism,
there still is black.

19:49.955 --> 19:50.923
- Right.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.225
- Usually a lot of it too.

19:53.292 --> 19:54.393
- Hi.

19:54.459 --> 19:55.894
- All right,
let's check it out.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.497
Tell us about your thought
process in designing this.

19:58.564 --> 20:01.800
- I wanted to display
all the fundamentals.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.935
- One of the things that I

20:03.001 --> 20:05.103
really like about it
is the linework.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.072
The only thing that
kind of throws me off is

20:07.139 --> 20:09.575
the skin breaks that you filled
in purple

20:09.641 --> 20:12.477
is actually where
the skin tones would be.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.047
- 'Cause there's purple,
it almost gives the effect

20:15.113 --> 20:17.516
that you're looking
through the hand...

20:17.583 --> 20:19.184
- Yeah, you're right.
- Into the back side.

20:19.251 --> 20:20.319
- Yeah, that's true.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.486
- There's a couple of areas,

20:21.553 --> 20:23.155
especially around the bottom

20:23.221 --> 20:25.624
of the filigree,
that get a little shaky.

20:25.691 --> 20:26.892
It would've been a simple fix

20:26.959 --> 20:28.994
if you filled that
space in with black.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.297
That way you could've secretly
filled in

20:32.364 --> 20:34.099
your linework and
fixed that line weight, and it

20:34.166 --> 20:35.734
would've given more dimension
and more contrast right there.

20:35.801 --> 20:36.935
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.136
Why didn't I
think of that earlier?

20:38.203 --> 20:39.705
- Well,
these are all things that,

20:39.771 --> 20:40.839
like, sometimes we just don't
think about in the moment.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.240
- Yeah, right.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.442
- We all know that
there's mistakes in tattoos,

20:43.508 --> 20:45.811
and tattooers tend to know how

20:45.877 --> 20:47.879
to cover them up,
and nobody notices.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.281
[laughter]

20:49.348 --> 20:51.016
- Okay, guys,
we have a lot of talking to do

20:51.083 --> 20:53.085
about these tattoos.
See you guys soon.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.420
- Hurry back.
[laughs]

20:55.487 --> 20:57.055
- All right, babes.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.724
- All of these tattoos
had some issues.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.325
But Tony DeVille's.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.960
- He had a tough time
with the hand.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.528
He over-corrected.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.896
He made it so dark.

21:04.963 --> 21:05.897
It looks like
a cover-up down there.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.532
- Right.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.334
Some of them brought their A
games, and some of them didn't.

21:09.401 --> 21:13.038
- One of the differences
between Ria and DeVille is that

21:13.105 --> 21:16.141
she made a conscious
effort to have a style.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.876
- And I did really
appreciate her linework.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.079
- I liked her design
more than I liked Scientific's.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.748
- I really was not expecting

21:22.814 --> 21:24.750
Scientific to get
through his tattoo.

21:24.816 --> 21:27.753
I was like, this dude bit off
way more than he can chew.

21:27.819 --> 21:28.754
- Mm-hmm.

21:28.820 --> 21:29.755
- But he made good decisions.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.289
He got rid of that background.

21:31.356 --> 21:34.059
He did a really
awesome-looking cat.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.362
- Well, it's interesting that,
you know, all four of us liked

21:37.429 --> 21:39.564
and disliked different elements

21:39.631 --> 21:41.833
from all of these
tattoos today.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.170
But I feel like through
all of our different opinions,

21:45.237 --> 21:47.205
we've come to a decision, yes?

21:47.272 --> 21:48.473
- I think so.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.908
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go let 'em know.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.044
- Whoo.
- Whoo.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.478
- I think it's--this is gonna

21:53.545 --> 21:55.380
be a close call,
that's for sure.

21:55.447 --> 22:01.353
- As far as size,
time, saturation, color blends,

22:01.420 --> 22:03.188
my tattoo is the biggest.

22:03.255 --> 22:06.158
- That's very true, but not
always the biggest tattoo wins.

22:06.224 --> 22:07.759
- I'm saying,
I put the biggest,

22:07.826 --> 22:08.994
that means
I put the most work in.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.796
- But I have
the best application.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.497
We can all agree on that.
- How do you figure that?

22:12.564 --> 22:13.865
- I can't all agree on that.

22:13.932 --> 22:15.300
- My client didn't
even turn red. [laughs]

22:15.367 --> 22:17.102
- Mine was pretty nice
all the way through, too.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.772

What you talkin' about?

22:20.839 --> 22:22.040

- Hey, what's going on?
- Hi, Angels.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.011

but we're here because we all

22:26.078 --> 22:28.747
believe to be the best, you're
gonna have to beat the best.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.782
- Right now we're giving you
an opportunity,

22:30.849 --> 22:34.352
because we have the keys to
the gates to a guaranteed spot

22:34.419 --> 22:36.521
to compete on Season 10
of "Ink Master."

22:36.588 --> 22:40.792
- Whoever comes out of this,
and if you do beat one of us,

22:40.859 --> 22:42.360
you have more of an advantage

22:42.427 --> 22:44.463

know what to expect now.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.634
You're gonna be under pressure,

22:49.701 --> 22:52.404
and you're gonna have to learn
to make decisions on the fly

22:52.471 --> 22:54.506
and hope that
you come out swinging.

22:54.573 --> 22:57.909
- Today's face-off really was
just a glimpse into our world.

22:57.976 --> 23:00.245
But ultimately,
there can only be one of you

23:00.312 --> 23:03.482

it's a pretty girl,

23:07.285 --> 23:09.721
but the tattoo
isn't very pretty.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.357

23:23.201 --> 23:25.604

there were some problems

23:25.670 --> 23:27.639
with your color choices,

23:27.706 --> 23:31.943

she was 22 years old.

28:45.323 --> 28:47.959
Her name was Meghan.
Mother of an 18-month-old.

28:48.026 --> 28:51.362
They had an argument

28:51.429 --> 28:53.765

one morning

28:53.832 --> 28:57.602

in the house.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.305
Her fiancé was also killed

29:00.371 --> 29:02.340

with no parents.

- Keep an eye on him, maybe
we can slow him down a little.

29:30.768 --> 29:34.038
- So, this is my nephew,
little David, right?

29:34.105 --> 29:35.673
He was a victim
of gun violence twice.

29:35.740 --> 29:36.908
- Twice?

29:36.975 --> 29:38.676
- The first time,
he survived it,

29:38.743 --> 29:41.179
but he ended up
with a colostomy bag.

29:41.246 --> 29:43.047
18 years old, then.
- Wow.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.184
- He got shot the second time,
and he didn't make it.

29:46.251 --> 29:49.721
I always felt like
I had to protect him in life.

29:49.787 --> 29:52.824
But now that he's gone,
he's my protector.

29:52.891 --> 29:56.060
