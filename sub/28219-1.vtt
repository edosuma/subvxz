07:17.437 --> 07:18.786
- You again, huh.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.484
Well, that figures.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.964
- Have we met?

07:23.007 --> 07:25.488
- Wrote you a ticket last week,
speeding on Federal.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.751
You were driving a '69 Mustang.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.450
- '68, actually. I...

07:30.493 --> 07:31.886
I traded her in.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.540
- For a '69 GTO?!

07:33.583 --> 07:37.152
- This bad boy's

07:40.808 --> 07:42.157

07:42.200 --> 07:45.508
- Yeah, but she only had 320,
and that was tops.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.293

07:50.513 --> 07:52.472

Harry James Barber.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.316
- Your real name's Harry?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.144
- Harry James Barber.

08:13.188 --> 08:16.147
- And you changed
your name because of
a bunch of speeding tickets.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.717
- I changed my name because--
- Because why?

08:22.371 --> 08:23.981
- Because the FBI's
looking for me.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.157
Eight years ago,
I robbed a bank in California.

08:27.158 --> 08:28.159
- Bullshit.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.683
- It was the biggest bank heist

08:29.726 --> 08:31.815
in U.S. history. Look it up.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.104
: Enzo!

09:01.410 --> 09:03.281
Bobby Lohman's here.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.895
- Hoffa got reamed big-time
by Nixon.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.680
Had to drop trousers,
bend over the warden's desk

09:10.724 --> 09:12.900
for a good dose of Tricky Dicky
to get out of the pen.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.118
- Fuck Nixon.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.599
- Exactly.
That's the whole idea.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.210
We're gonna rip off the
President of the United States.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.212
It doesn't get any bigger
or better than that.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.432
- How much we talking here?

09:23.475 --> 09:25.521
- Could be
as much as 30 million.

09:28.350 --> 09:31.309
- Hold on a sec. Does Hoffa know
you're pitching this to us?

09:31.353 --> 09:34.486
- What Jimmy Hoffa
knows or doesn't know
is for him to know, not you.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.010
- I just wanna make sure
it's solid information.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.838
- I told you,
it's sterling fucking silver.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.449
Our guy was in the room
when the White House coppos

09:40.492 --> 09:43.670
were shaking down
the Dairy Board for off-the-book
campaign contributions.

09:43.713 --> 09:46.324
I even, uh,
got a little souvenir.

09:47.761 --> 09:51.068
For you. Keep it.
I'll be waiting for your call.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.337
: Seems too good
to be true.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.863
: Why would Bobby make up
shit like this?

10:02.906 --> 10:04.821
- It just don't compute.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.824
I mean, everyone knows
Nixon's gonna win re-election
hands down, right?

10:07.868 --> 10:10.566
Why would he put
all this bag money
in a bank in California?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.134
- Because he's a crook. And
crooks don't know how to stop

10:13.177 --> 10:14.831
when they're ahead,
so it computes perfectly.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.921
We hit the bank,
take the 30-mil,

10:17.965 --> 10:20.968
and Nixon can't do squat because
the money's filthy dirty.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.752
- Seems like the President
of the United States

10:22.796 --> 10:24.406
could do whatever the fuck
he wants to do.

10:24.449 --> 10:26.582
He's got the CIA, the FBI,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.932
the ATF and the IRS.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.108
It's like
an alphabet soup enema.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.328
No thank you. I'm out.

10:33.371 --> 10:36.897
- It's the commander in chief
who's gonna be shitting
in his pants, Pauly, not us.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.029
- Jesus, I know you
fucking hate Nixon.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.596
- He's a cocksucker.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.337
And a motherfucker.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.730
And a bullshit artist--

10:43.773 --> 10:45.601
- Yeah, I know.
I've heard this already.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.821
- Nixon'S hosed the steel
companies here in town.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.519
He's trying to flush the unions
down the crapper,

10:50.562 --> 10:53.783
he's out there killing
college kids with fucking M16s,

10:53.827 --> 10:56.264
bombing naked little
Cambodian children,

10:56.307 --> 10:58.309
running around
with fucking rice paddies.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.486
And he's cramming
200,000 American boys

11:01.530 --> 11:03.793
into a fucking meat-grinder
called Vietnam.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.273
- This isn't personal, Enzo.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.623
- Oh, no? I didn't know that.
- We're professionals.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.451

about California.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.409

11:11.453 --> 11:13.847
Life is too short.
We're not getting any younger.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.501
- Stop! Stop with the
"we're not getting any younger"
bullshit, okay?

You wanna retire?
Go fucking retire.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.027

this kind of action

Nuh-uh. Not me.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.990

11:27.034 --> 11:29.689

11:31.168 --> 11:33.170

Now, we know that
cutting the electricity

16:04.615 --> 16:07.096
would have done shit.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.794
- Oh! Come here.

16:16.105 --> 16:17.759
- You got balls.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.026
Torch the car.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.377
- What? This...

16:27.421 --> 16:29.727
This is a Pontiac GTO, man.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.555
This is gonna be
a classy car someday.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.123
- That's great. Always torch
the car after a job.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.821
- I just stole it last week.
- Really?

16:36.865 --> 16:39.215
Lesson fucking learned.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.541
: Torch a car
right after every job.

17:00.584 --> 17:01.933
Can't believe this guy.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.765
: What are you, crying?

17:07.809 --> 17:10.203
You got something
in your eyes? Huh?

17:11.073 --> 17:12.596
Turn in your uniform.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.948
- What does that mean?

17:17.601 --> 17:19.908
- It means,
turn in your uniform.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.566
- What am I supposed to do?
How am I gonna get another job?

17:26.697 --> 17:29.613
I got speeding tickets
that've gotten warrant by now.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.180
- Yeah, I gotta
take care of those

17:31.224 --> 17:33.487
because you can't drive for me
with outstanding warrants.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.664
- You mean...

17:36.707 --> 17:38.057
...I'm in?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.536
- Yeah, you're in.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.756
: Yes.

17:43.671 --> 17:44.759
Can I hug you?

17:49.155 --> 17:50.895
- I should have
my fucking head examined.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.332
- You won't regret this.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.637
- I already do.

17:53.681 --> 17:56.684
- Uncle Enzo, um...

17:57.685 --> 17:59.382
What about Tommy?

17:59.426 --> 18:01.167
- Don't press your luck.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.866
Round everybody up.
Class is in session.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.824
There's the motion detector.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.697
That's what triggered it when
Harry ripped it off the wall.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.742
Look, see that? No wires.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.484
Works from a radio signal...

18:14.528 --> 18:17.618
I gotta tell you, it took me
five minutes to pick the lock,
on the bench here.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.924
There's no way that I...

18:19.968 --> 18:21.926
...can do that hanging off
the roof of the bank.

18:21.970 --> 18:24.755
- I don't know why we're gonna
bust our balls with some Pinas
guy bank job

18:24.799 --> 18:26.017
in some fucking lagoon.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.715
- It's Laguna Niguel, okay?

18:27.758 --> 18:30.935
It's Spanish for... something.
I don't fucking know.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.460
Just, just... stop the
"we don't need this job", okay?

18:33.503 --> 18:35.375
- You just said you can't pick
the lock upside down.

18:35.418 --> 18:36.637
How are you gonna
shut off the alarm?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.291
- I'm working on it.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.641
- You better do better than that
if you expect me to back you up.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.600
: I know
how you could do it.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.952
- You got some stuff here.
- Yeah, wipe your mouth.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.173
It's disgusting.
: What?

18:51.217 --> 18:54.394
- When Tommy got back from Nam,

18:54.437 --> 18:56.744
I went and met him
in California,

18:56.787 --> 18:59.312
and he had this buddy that
worked at a surf shop, right?

18:59.355 --> 19:02.532
And in his shop, he had
this shit in an aerosol can

19:02.576 --> 19:06.275
and he'd spray it in
the surf boards into the dents.

19:06.319 --> 19:10.061
Anyway, it'd come out
goopy, right. And then,
after a few seconds,

19:10.105 --> 19:12.673
it'd expand,
swell up like crazy.

19:12.716 --> 19:16.372
And then,
after a couple of minutes,
it would go rock hard.

19:17.678 --> 19:22.117
So they could shape
the surfboard, you know, uh,
trim it, sand it, you know.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.425
The surfboards looked
like brand new.
- Okay.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.818
So, we all know
how to fix a surfboard now.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.778
What the fuck does that
have to do with the alarm?

19:32.258 --> 19:34.477
: Squirt the goopy shit
through the vent,

19:34.521 --> 19:38.655
let it expand, harden,
it'll stop the dinger
from hitting the bell.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.706
- Son of a gun.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.664
I like this kid.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.540
: Molly?

19:53.583 --> 19:54.671
Honey.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.501
Come out here, sweetie.
- Go away.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.112
- Okay. I'm coming in.

20:01.156 --> 20:04.246
- Do not come in. Seven years,
we've been together,

20:04.290 --> 20:06.727
and this is how
you break up with me?
- Wait, what?!

20:06.770 --> 20:09.947
- You're too chicken shit to
say you're breaking up with me,

20:09.991 --> 20:13.560
so you come up with this...
bullshit story instead.

20:13.603 --> 20:17.128
- I'm tellin you the truth.
- Oh, sure. You're wanted
by the FBI.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.260
You know what?

20:18.304 --> 20:20.175
If you wanna leave, fine.
Just leave.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.569
Just don't make me
into a fool.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.834
What is this?

20:35.582 --> 20:38.193
- I was in the post office
yesterday and,

20:38.237 --> 20:40.804
I saw my own face
staring back at me.

20:40.848 --> 20:44.199
- You colored your hair.
- Yeah.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.724
- And you... you curled it.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.292
- Yeah, to look
like Steve McQueen.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.951
: Well, I guess there's
a first time for everything.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.954
: Can we please
go back to the table?

20:59.997 --> 21:02.130
- Why? So you can lie to me
some more?

21:02.173 --> 21:04.088
- I'm not lying.

21:04.132 --> 21:07.527
- You lied to me
from the moment you said,
"Hello, my name is John Baker."

21:07.570 --> 21:10.007
So don't tell me
you're not lying.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.575

21:30.898 --> 21:33.074
Nobody knows
we're in California.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.815
Let's just keep it that way.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.947
- If you see any movie stars,
pull over.

21:36.991 --> 21:39.602
- Yeah, could use some
Hollywood poontang.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.604

21:41.648 --> 21:43.911

21:43.954 --> 21:47.654

Not Edith Bunker!

21:58.404 --> 22:00.884

I got bigger tits than her.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.761

tits or not tits.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.371
I bet she's a real spinner.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.938

22:18.554 --> 22:20.208

Knock it off! Come on,
drive the car.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.651
Just sit back

22:28.695 --> 22:30.610
You're acting

22:30.653 --> 22:33.003
- Just look out the window,
where you got the ocean.

22:33.047 --> 22:36.311
There you got palm trees
and everything, my God.

22:38.792 --> 22:42.186

23:26.535 --> 23:28.494

23:30.234 --> 23:33.673
- Hey. Check this out.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.942
You see that building?

23:41.985 --> 23:43.987
Just the other side
of the golf course.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.293
- That's the bank.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.555
- Yep.

23:46.599 --> 23:49.645
- Good job, kid.
- Thanks, Enz.

23:49.689 --> 23:52.474
- Talk about a hole in one.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.695
The fuck is that vat for?
We gonna crush some grapes?

23:55.738 --> 23:57.131
: That's a hot tub.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.961
- What the fuck is a hot tub?

24:02.049 --> 24:04.486
Look at this, boys.
Like a picture fucking postcard.

24:04.530 --> 24:08.838
- No shit, huh? After this job,
I'ma get me a fucking hot tub.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.449
- Once we're in the crawlspace,

24:10.492 --> 24:13.452
I'll cut the direct lines
to the alarms and sensors.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.714
- Cool.

24:14.757 --> 24:18.282
- Yeah. Polly will drill
into the vault ceiling

24:18.326 --> 24:19.762
to place the dynamite.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.242
- That is so cool.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.462
- Yeah. And we're gonna blow
right through that thing.

24:23.505 --> 24:27.335
Now, the burlap bags,
Tommy will fill with soil
from the planters.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.119
And that will be used for...

24:29.163 --> 24:32.079
- Uh, to muffle the sound
of the blast.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.777
- Yes, and to direct the blast
downward. Not up.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.736
- Genius.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.436
- And if everybody
does their job,

24:41.480 --> 24:44.483
we should be looking
at Nixon's milk money...

24:45.440 --> 24:47.529
...within an hour.

24:51.272 --> 24:54.493
: You ever read that
Jonathan Livingston Seagull?

24:54.536 --> 24:56.495
- Yeah, I heard that's
a pretty good book.

24:56.538 --> 24:59.541
- You know? You'll never look
at those cock-sucking birds
the same again,

24:59.585 --> 25:01.761
I'll tell you that much.
- Smart birds.

25:01.804 --> 25:04.546
- Oh, you have no idea.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.420
- What the fuck?

25:09.464 --> 25:11.466
Hey! Motherfuckers!

25:11.510 --> 25:14.077
- Sorry! I shanked my drive!

25:14.121 --> 25:17.211
- I'll shank you,
you sherbet-colored asshole!

25:17.254 --> 25:19.561
- Hey! Fuck you!

25:19.605 --> 25:22.564
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

25:22.608 --> 25:25.480
I'll shove that fucking putter
up your fucking ass!

25:25.524 --> 25:28.918
- It's a driver, you moron!
: Jesus H. Christ!

25:28.962 --> 25:31.094
What the hell
are you guys doing?

25:31.138 --> 25:32.792
You're supposed to be
laying low.

25:32.835 --> 25:35.534
You gotta keep your cool, Ray.
All of you.

25:35.577 --> 25:39.146
Harry's the only one here
with a modicum of intelligence.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.803
- What's a modicum?

25:45.326 --> 25:47.110
: Get out
of that thing, will ya?

25:47.154 --> 25:50.200
Everybody get dressed.
We're going to look at the bank.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.637
Remember, the bank?

26:03.649 --> 26:06.608
- The bank manager
says they leave at 5:30 p.m.
on Friday,

26:06.652 --> 26:08.654
and don't return
until Monday at 9 a.m.,

26:08.697 --> 26:10.917
so the break-in could've
occurred any time between--
- Good morning, Sharon.

26:12.266 --> 26:13.659
- Good morning, sir.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.104
What do you think that is?
- It's not bird shit.

26:24.147 --> 26:27.455
Whatever it is, it sure did
shut that alarm up, didn't it?

26:29.022 --> 26:30.458
Huh.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.158
- Damn it.

26:35.202 --> 26:36.812
The front and back doors
were still locked.

26:36.856 --> 26:40.250
The alarm never tripped,
no prints, no witnesses.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.862
The bank manager said he didn't
notice anything unusual

26:42.905 --> 26:45.212
until he opened up the vault.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.194
- This is not local work.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.805
- How do you know that?

27:13.501 --> 27:15.024
- This is Southern California.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.853
Why break a sweat
chopping a hole in a roof,

27:17.897 --> 27:20.682
when all you need
is a starter pistol,
and a freeway map?

27:20.726 --> 27:22.684
- I'm not sure I follow, sir.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.121
- We're the bank robbery
capital of the world.

27:25.165 --> 27:29.125
For two reasons:
on-ramps, and off-ramps.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.695
I mean, the last time I saw
a vault job like this,

27:33.739 --> 27:35.784
Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin
were doing it.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.179
In that movie.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.007
Ocean's Eleven.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.139
- Oh, I never saw it, sir.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.360
- You gotta get out more,
Sharon.

27:46.403 --> 27:47.709
- Yes, sir.

27:48.884 --> 27:50.581
- I was here on Saturday.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.496
- What were you doing here?

27:52.540 --> 27:55.848
- Sam plays little league.
This is the pick-up spot
for the away teams.

27:56.544 --> 27:59.199
I been doing double duty
ever since

27:59.242 --> 28:01.505
Karen and I, we decided
to take a little break.

28:06.293 --> 28:08.730
- You didn't notice anything
when you were here?

28:10.297 --> 28:11.690
- Nope.

28:13.430 --> 28:17.086
- Well, how do you blast
a three-foot diameter hole
in concrete,

28:17.130 --> 28:19.219
without anyone
noticing anything?

28:19.262 --> 28:22.483
- Well, you gotta be very good,
and very lucky.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.050
Or both.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.748
- That's the only thing
standing between us,

28:26.792 --> 28:28.358
and Nixon's milk money.

28:28.402 --> 28:31.753
: 18 inches of concrete
ain't cream cheese.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.668
- Nah, Pauly,
you could do it in your sleep.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.758
- He's gonna fucking
wake up a few folks
when he sets that shit off.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.673
And what about this joint
next door?

28:38.717 --> 28:40.022
- Looks pretty quiet to me.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.372
Throw in a few extra sand bags,
no big deal.

28:42.416 --> 28:45.767
: Ja-Narly's.
What kind of name is that?
Italian?

28:45.811 --> 28:48.335
: It's not Ja-Narly's,
it's Gnarly's.

28:48.378 --> 28:51.642
You know, like... Extreme.

28:51.686 --> 28:54.384
Radical. Balls out.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.212
- Balls out?
- Yeah.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.388
- No, fuck that shit,
I ain't going to no gay bar.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.782
: Come on,
let's go around back.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.485
- Hey, asshole!

29:14.230 --> 29:17.146
- You mean this shit
is gonna be going on
when we're doing the job?

29:17.190 --> 29:18.582
- We can come back
when they close.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.410
- What, one a.m.?

29:20.454 --> 29:22.804
That only gives us four hours
before sunrise.

29:27.678 --> 29:30.159
- Maybe a little noise
is just what we need.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.515
: There you go,
number one.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.997
Shake those boobs, yeah!
Nice tits!

29:48.308 --> 29:49.265
- Where you going?

29:50.527 --> 29:52.268
- To find Tommy.

29:56.011 --> 29:59.493
: I'm from Siena,
in Italy, but I came across
to the U.S.

29:59.536 --> 30:02.713
And your name is Tommy?
- Mm-hmm.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.892
I will call you Tomato.

30:21.515 --> 30:22.951
- I trusted you.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.693
- I know.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.479
- Like I never trusted
nobody before.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.307
- I know!

30:38.445 --> 30:40.839
: We're not open 'til noon!

30:46.105 --> 30:47.410
- Give me a boilermaker!

30:47.454 --> 30:49.935
: I said we're closed.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.286
- They're burying my husband
at the cemetery across the road,

30:53.329 --> 30:55.636
so I'm gonna need
a boilermaker...

30:55.679 --> 30:57.986
And a dollar's worth
of quarters.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.256
- Miss?

31:14.568 --> 31:15.786
- You're new.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.964
- Yeah. Just started last week.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.472
- I hate pantyhose.
- Me too.

31:50.473 --> 31:52.084
Boilermaker.
- Boilermaker.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.361
- Thanks.

I'll have another.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.740
- Sorry for your loss.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.047
- I'm not.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.573
I just put all my eggs
in the wrong basket.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.836
You ever done that?

33:32.880 --> 33:34.664
- Yeah.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.971
You could say that.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.452
- He cheated on me a year ago.

33:39.495 --> 33:42.020
With my best friend.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.154
You know, I never did trust him.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.549
- How'd he pass away?

33:49.592 --> 33:52.813
- He didn't exactly "pass away",

33:52.856 --> 33:55.816
as much as he passed
on the right.

33:57.861 --> 34:01.169
He rear-ended a flatbed truck
parked on the side of the road.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.171
He was drunk.

34:03.215 --> 34:07.088
Drunk, and decapitated.

34:09.612 --> 34:12.441
You know, he wasn't exactly
still my husband.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.053
I left him.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.925
Moved back home
with my folks.

34:17.968 --> 34:21.146
Would've been my ex-husband.

34:21.189 --> 34:24.192
But now...

34:24.236 --> 34:27.413
I'm the widow Murphy,
and I get the life insurance.

34:29.458 --> 34:32.113
Ain't karma grand?

34:33.332 --> 34:35.116
- You believe in karma.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.162
- Yeah, consequences.

34:37.205 --> 34:40.295
Good always equals good,
and bad always bites you
in the ass,

34:40.339 --> 34:41.731
you just never know when.

34:51.959 --> 34:54.483
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!
No! No!

34:54.527 --> 34:56.616
Please don't tell them
I'm here!

34:56.659 --> 34:58.487
- Hey, guys.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.229
- You the new guy?

35:01.273 --> 35:02.709
- Yeah.

35:04.754 --> 35:06.234
- Uh-huh...

35:06.278 --> 35:08.454
Molly Murphy come in here?

35:08.497 --> 35:10.847
- Pff... who's that?

35:10.891 --> 35:14.590
- Young woman, black dress.
Is kinda... scrawny looking.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.680
- It's just me, Officer.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.378
I mean,
we're not even open, yet.

35:19.421 --> 35:23.164
- Okay. Well, if you see a chick
in a black dress come in here,

35:23.208 --> 35:26.733
you tell her there's
a funeral service waiting
for her across the road.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.038
- Scrawny gal.

35:29.039 --> 35:30.171
Will do, Officer.

35:44.838 --> 35:46.231
- Thanks.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.757
- So, you gonna go
to the funeral?

35:52.324 --> 35:54.152
- I don't know.

35:55.718 --> 35:58.112
I really just want
to keep hiding.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.507
- Do you know the old
Vogue Theater?

36:02.464 --> 36:03.726
- Of course.

36:03.770 --> 36:05.467
- Well, I rent
the apartment upstairs,

36:05.511 --> 36:09.079
I think it used to be
the manager's office,
or something.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.477
That's the key to the side door.

36:18.219 --> 36:22.354
And this is the key to my car,
it's parked out in the front.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.443
Take it.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.100
- That's really nice.

36:34.104 --> 36:36.019
Um, put this on my tab.

36:37.369 --> 36:38.935
- Do you have a tab?

36:38.979 --> 36:42.504
- No. What did you say
your name was?

36:44.593 --> 36:46.552
- John Baker.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.339
- John Baker. I'm Molly Murphy.

36:51.383 --> 36:53.733
It's nice to meet you.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.484
Is that seat taken?

37:49.528 --> 37:50.572
- Yes.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.582
- I thought I'd find you
passed out,

38:00.626 --> 38:01.975
with an empty bottle
of Jack Daniel's.

38:03.672 --> 38:06.066
- Well, you know,
I'm not really much
of a drinker.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.590
- Pff... You were doing
pretty good earlier.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.549
- I didn't know
what else to do.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.727
You know, I used to come here
every weekend.

38:14.770 --> 38:15.858
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

38:15.902 --> 38:17.338
- When did the place shut down?

38:17.382 --> 38:21.081
- About five years ago.
I saw Bonnie and Clyde here.

38:21.124 --> 38:25.085
Three times, in the same day.
Did you ever see it?

38:25.128 --> 38:27.870
- Yeah, yeah.
Just the once, though.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.308
- I could watch it
a thousand more times.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.357
- Why do you like it so much?

38:36.401 --> 38:39.142
- Well, it's one of the greatest
love stories of all time.

38:41.449 --> 38:43.364
They were fearless.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.801
Always staying one step ahead
of the law.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.936
Warren Beatty would do anything
to keep Faye Dunaway safe,

38:49.979 --> 38:52.417
and she would do anything
for him.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.723
Right until the end.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.597
That's love.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.427
It's romance.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.739
I'm gonna have sex with you.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.533
Not today.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.016
I'm not exactly sure when.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.108
I'll let you know.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.242
- Cool.

39:36.852 --> 39:38.680
- This is my new
number one rule:

39:40.073 --> 39:41.814
No more lies.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.732
- That's...
That's a pretty good rule.

39:46.775 --> 39:49.212
- Yeah, you don't need
any others if you got that one.

39:49.256 --> 39:50.692
- I guess not.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.906
: Let's go, come on!

40:50.448 --> 40:52.319
Harry! Come on!

41:40.889 --> 41:42.195
Look at this thing.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.066
Last time I saw
a shit box like this,

41:44.110 --> 41:46.765
was in a pawn shop
in Cincinnati. What a joke.

41:46.808 --> 41:48.418
Alright, here we go.

41:49.768 --> 41:51.247
Give me the radio.

41:52.248 --> 41:54.120
Anything on the scanner?

41:54.163 --> 41:55.513
- Not a fucking peep.

41:55.556 --> 41:57.645
Sounds like they only got
one patrol car working,

41:57.689 --> 42:01.170
and he's writing a ticket
for an illegal bonfire
on the beach.

42:12.834 --> 42:13.922
- Here.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.587
- Come on, we're clear.
Let's go, hurry up!

42:29.764 --> 42:31.766
- Fire in the hole,
motherfuckers!

42:31.810 --> 42:32.898
- Do it.

42:45.214 --> 42:46.868
- Earthquake!

42:50.350 --> 42:53.179
- Jesus Christ, Pauly!
What the fuck?!

42:54.659 --> 42:56.661
- It was tough drilling,
so I upped the charge!

42:56.704 --> 42:59.359
Just my miscalculation,
don't go shitting yourself!

42:59.402 --> 43:01.187
- Shut up!

43:01.230 --> 43:03.102
I think we're getting a call.

43:03.145 --> 43:05.365
Yes, fuck.

43:05.408 --> 43:08.324
Patrol car's on its way
to check the bank, fuck!

43:08.368 --> 43:10.500
- Christ, it wasn't that loud!

43:15.723 --> 43:17.769
- Let's get out of here!
- Sit tight.

43:17.812 --> 43:20.510
Harry. Take a walk out front
and see what you see.

43:20.554 --> 43:22.730
Take a radio. Tommy,
help him with the ladder.

43:43.751 --> 43:45.840
- They're heading around back.

43:47.581 --> 43:49.714
: Harry!
Get out of there, now!

43:49.757 --> 43:52.194
- Don't worry. I got a plan.

43:52.238 --> 43:54.849
: No, Harry, no!
What are you doing?!

43:54.893 --> 43:56.155
Harry?!

44:12.606 --> 44:13.999
- Watch it, asshole!

44:16.566 --> 44:17.698
- Fuck you!

44:20.919 --> 44:23.356
: Alright, alright.
Settle down.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.446
- Fuck you! Bitch!

44:29.101 --> 44:30.406
Fuck off!

44:32.191 --> 44:33.583
Fuck!

44:33.627 --> 44:34.846
: This is an arrest.
We're taking him in.

44:34.889 --> 44:38.501
- Fuck! I didn't do shit!
- Cut it out!

44:46.205 --> 44:48.816
- I love this podunk town.

45:22.328 --> 45:25.374
- Damn. There must be
a thousand fucking boxes
down here.

45:25.418 --> 45:27.550
- Nah. 500-600, tops.

45:27.594 --> 45:29.552
- We're never gonna get
all these fuckers popped open.

45:29.596 --> 45:31.206
- We came here
to personally rob

45:31.250 --> 45:33.600
the President
of the United States of America,

45:33.643 --> 45:36.429
and we are not leaving
until we do.

45:36.472 --> 45:37.952
Harry, Tom! Come on!

45:37.996 --> 45:39.737
: We should start
with the big boxes first.

45:39.780 --> 45:43.697
- No. Every box in order,
on each wall. Starting there.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.265
- We're never gonna be able
to squeeze 30 million
of these little boxes.

45:46.308 --> 45:49.007
- Hey, Pauly.
It's not all gonna be in cash.
These ain't drug dealers.

45:49.050 --> 45:51.009
These guys are slick,
they're politicians.

45:51.052 --> 45:54.055
We're taking bearer bonds,
offshore accounts,

45:54.099 --> 45:57.537
cashiers checks. That's how
these cocksuckers roll.

46:00.018 --> 46:00.975
That's it!

46:12.073 --> 46:13.118
- Fucking bag, come on!

46:16.512 --> 46:18.950
- We're still looking
for the shit dick!

46:18.993 --> 46:20.734
- Hey, look at this!

46:25.478 --> 46:27.088
It's remains.

46:51.852 --> 46:54.724
Look at this!
Fucking Kruggerands
up the wazoo!

46:54.768 --> 46:57.858
- Hey, hey, diamonds too.
Some pretty swanky shit
going on.

46:57.902 --> 46:59.077
- It's like fucking Christmas!

46:59.120 --> 47:01.862
- Alright, half an hour
before sunrise.

47:01.906 --> 47:03.211
Let's bag it up.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.701
: We cleared
over four million that night.

47:14.744 --> 47:17.225
But we still hadn't found
Nixon's money.

47:17.269 --> 47:19.880
And Enzo, he wouldn't stop
until we did.

47:19.924 --> 47:21.664
But with the bank closed
for the weekend,

47:21.708 --> 47:24.363
we still had Saturday
and Sunday night to go.

47:34.939 --> 47:36.418
- So let me get this straight.

47:36.462 --> 47:38.768
You guys set out to rob Nixon?

47:38.812 --> 47:41.380
- Shh! Yes.

47:41.423 --> 47:44.122
- The President
of the United States.

47:44.165 --> 47:46.602
- Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

47:46.646 --> 47:50.563
- And you thought you could
get away with that how, exactly?

47:50.606 --> 47:52.130
- Because it was dirty money.

47:54.088 --> 47:57.483
See, we figured Nixon
couldn't do nothing to us

47:57.526 --> 47:58.614
if we ripped him off.

48:01.791 --> 48:03.141
We were wrong.

48:47.968 --> 48:50.666
- He's getting better,
don't you think?

48:52.581 --> 48:54.018
- What?

49:18.651 --> 49:20.435
- Sharon.
- Sir.

49:20.479 --> 49:21.741
More coffee?

49:21.784 --> 49:23.656
- I can get my own coffee.
Thanks.

49:23.699 --> 49:24.918
- Yes, sir.

49:28.139 --> 49:30.228
- Sharon. How long
were you on a desk

49:30.271 --> 49:32.012
before they let you
into the academy?

49:32.056 --> 49:33.405
- Two years, sir.

49:36.321 --> 49:38.453
- You're the first female
through, right?

49:38.497 --> 49:41.195
- One of two. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

49:41.239 --> 49:45.243
- I was a first, too.
A lot of pressure.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.247
This is my, um...

49:50.639 --> 49:53.164
...eighth field office
in ten years.

49:53.207 --> 49:56.602
Karen said that she never wanted
to move again.

49:59.126 --> 50:00.649
It's ironic, you know.

50:03.217 --> 50:07.004
You give up a lot to do this.
A lot.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.617
Don't want to give up
everything, though.

50:14.185 --> 50:15.882
Gotta find balance.

50:15.925 --> 50:17.840
I haven't been able
to find it yet,

50:17.884 --> 50:19.755
but I'm optimistic.

50:21.279 --> 50:22.323
- Sir?

50:22.367 --> 50:25.544
Um, I thought
about what you said,

50:25.587 --> 50:27.850
about getting out more.

50:29.069 --> 50:32.942
I got... tickets
for The Godfather.

50:32.986 --> 50:34.379
Have you seen it?

50:34.422 --> 50:37.773
- Uh... Twice.
- Right.

50:37.817 --> 50:40.080
- Sir? Deputy Director Felt
is here.

50:40.950 --> 50:42.213
- Felt's in the office?

50:42.256 --> 50:43.910
- He just came in
from Washington unannounced,

50:43.953 --> 50:45.564
and he's not alone.

50:57.793 --> 50:59.056
- How are you?

50:59.099 --> 51:00.622
- Confused.

51:00.666 --> 51:02.537
- So am I.

51:02.581 --> 51:04.713
The inventory
of the safety deposit box

51:04.757 --> 51:06.367
that's supplied by the bank

51:06.411 --> 51:08.065
seems somehow incomplete.

51:09.501 --> 51:10.980
Apologies, Howard.

51:12.199 --> 51:14.549
- Let me save you some time,
sir.

51:14.593 --> 51:18.205
These 456 boxes...
were smashed open.

51:18.249 --> 51:21.121
Some of them still contained
cash and jewelry.

51:21.165 --> 51:24.820
The burglars were obviously
looking for something specific.

51:24.864 --> 51:26.909
- Any ideas?

51:26.953 --> 51:28.259
- Not yet.

51:30.130 --> 51:32.306
But I'm well-equipped
to handle this investigation
on my own, sir.

51:32.350 --> 51:34.221
- Of course you are.

51:37.877 --> 51:39.618
- With all due respect,

51:39.661 --> 51:42.273
why have an additional
hundred agents been assigned
to my case?

51:51.456 --> 51:54.328
- There's a very high level
of interest in this case,
Howard.

51:54.372 --> 51:55.677
- From Mr. Hoover?

51:55.721 --> 51:56.939
- Higher.

51:56.983 --> 51:58.289
- Higher?

51:58.332 --> 52:00.595
- This incident appears
to have created

52:00.639 --> 52:02.945
some consternation
in the Oval office.

52:03.772 --> 52:05.861
- Can you tell me?
- I can't.

52:05.905 --> 52:08.299
I haven't been offered
an explanation myself.

52:08.342 --> 52:10.257
- I find that very hard
to believe, sir.

52:10.301 --> 52:12.172
- I'd imagine you would.

52:12.216 --> 52:15.044
There's a bumper crop
of secrets in Washington
these days, Howard.

52:15.088 --> 52:17.438
That's why I need you
to solve this case

52:17.482 --> 52:19.092
as quickly as possible,
so we can find out

52:19.136 --> 52:20.659
what the hell it is
they're not telling us.

52:21.703 --> 52:24.184
I've gotta get back.
You report directly to me.

52:24.228 --> 52:25.316
- Yes, sir.

52:43.638 --> 52:45.118
- Everything okay?

52:46.946 --> 52:48.861
- I should have taken
that coffee.

52:49.731 --> 52:51.516
- Well, we're out of coffee.

52:51.559 --> 52:55.172
And desks, and telephones,
and toilet paper.

52:55.215 --> 52:56.521
- I finally get something
interesting,

52:56.564 --> 52:58.044
and they want to take it
from me.

52:59.219 --> 53:00.699
- Between this
and San Clemente,

53:00.742 --> 53:03.180
there are more federal agents
here than in Washington.

53:04.268 --> 53:05.443
- San Clemente?

53:05.486 --> 53:07.096
- Yes, sir.

53:07.140 --> 53:10.361
The President
is spending his vacation there.

53:11.579 --> 53:12.798
- The Western White House?

53:12.841 --> 53:14.495
- What is it?

53:14.539 --> 53:16.845
- San Clemente is ten miles
away from that bank.

53:17.629 --> 53:19.631
- What does that have to do
with the bank job?

53:21.807 --> 53:23.287
- Maybe nothing.

53:24.984 --> 53:26.507
Maybe everything.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.599
What's the golden rule
of a homicide investigation?

53:31.643 --> 53:33.514
- Motive.
- Motive!

53:33.558 --> 53:36.256
So, why this bank,

53:36.300 --> 53:38.127
and why these
safe-deposit boxes?

53:38.171 --> 53:39.955
- 'Cause they knew
what they were looking for.

53:39.999 --> 53:41.479
- Exactly, they knew.

53:42.480 --> 53:45.700
You have any customers
with out of state addresses?

53:45.744 --> 53:47.267
- As a matter of fact,
I think so.

53:47.311 --> 53:49.051
- Let's have a look,
let's check it out.

54:05.416 --> 54:06.852
- Here we go.

54:06.895 --> 54:11.117
C.W. Colson, with a P.O. box
in Arlington, Virginia.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.380
- Arlington? Alright.

54:13.424 --> 54:16.427
I want you to do
the background check personally
on Mr. Colson.

54:16.470 --> 54:17.471
- Yes, sir.

54:18.255 --> 54:19.256
- Good.

54:23.390 --> 54:26.001
Sharon? Have you been
following this Watergate thing?

54:26.045 --> 54:27.046
- Yes, sir.

54:28.134 --> 54:29.396
- What do you think about it?

54:30.354 --> 54:31.833
- From what I read
in the papers,

54:31.877 --> 54:33.966
that crew seems like
a bunch of amateurs.

54:37.012 --> 54:39.145
You think our case
has something to do
with that circus?

54:40.494 --> 54:41.626
- I don't know.

54:41.669 --> 54:44.063
But, what I do know is that

54:44.106 --> 54:46.108
the last time the Bureau

54:46.152 --> 54:50.156
assigned 100 agents
to a single investigation,

54:50.199 --> 54:52.985
was when John F. Kennedy
was assassinated.

54:54.203 --> 54:56.945
- I swear to God, the next time
I think I'm gonna fall in love,

54:56.989 --> 54:58.904
I'm gonna fall off
a bridge instead.

55:02.777 --> 55:04.866
Of all the small towns
in the country...

55:06.041 --> 55:07.869
...why did you pick Deerwood?

55:07.913 --> 55:12.657
- Actually. I didn't pick it,
it kind of picked me.

55:13.788 --> 55:15.964
You see, I was driving
through town,

55:16.008 --> 55:18.880
and the water pump
in my truck went out.

55:18.924 --> 55:20.882
By the time I got it fixed,

55:20.926 --> 55:23.842
I had a job
at the Deer Meat Tavern.

55:23.885 --> 55:25.452
Then I met you.

55:26.410 --> 55:28.629
- You stayed in Deerwood
because of me?

55:28.673 --> 55:30.501
- What do you think?

55:49.433 --> 55:51.260
- Now, remember, okay?

55:51.304 --> 55:54.176
Don't mention that we met
at the Deer Meat Tavern.

55:57.179 --> 55:58.790
What are you doing?

55:58.833 --> 56:00.792
- The great escape.

56:02.794 --> 56:05.710
- So you tell them
that we met in town.

56:05.753 --> 56:08.582
- Whereabouts?
- Dairy Queen.

56:08.626 --> 56:10.889
- What happened to your
"no lie" rule?

56:10.932 --> 56:13.500
- This is the exception
that makes the rule.

56:13.544 --> 56:17.504
And listen, maybe don't bring up
Nixon, or Watergate.

56:17.548 --> 56:18.984
My dad's a Republican.

56:19.027 --> 56:20.420
Oh, and he hates
Billie Jean King,

56:20.464 --> 56:21.726
and Phil Donahue,
and Jane Fonda.

56:21.769 --> 56:23.989
Are you
a Pittsburgh Pirates fan?

56:25.033 --> 56:26.252
- I don't have to be.

56:26.295 --> 56:28.036
- No, that's good!
My dad loves the Pirates!

56:28.080 --> 56:29.342
- Molly, why is there--

56:29.386 --> 56:30.822
- Hey, everyone!

56:30.865 --> 56:32.606
: Hey!

56:34.173 --> 56:35.740
: Go, Pirates.

56:36.480 --> 56:37.916
- This is John Baker.

56:37.959 --> 56:40.527
He's new in town,
so don't act like the SWAT team

56:40.571 --> 56:41.876
and scare him off, okay?

56:43.356 --> 56:46.185
- Oh, now. Come on down, here.
Welcome to our home!

56:46.228 --> 56:47.926
John, right? John, is it?

56:47.969 --> 56:49.406
Just call me Jerry,
everybody does.

56:49.449 --> 56:50.755
Hey, sweetheart.

56:50.798 --> 56:52.626
- Look, everybody.
There's fever in the funk house.

56:52.670 --> 56:56.021
Now! It's a party!
- I promise, I promise.
Rose, Rose...

56:56.064 --> 56:58.327
- You are beautiful.
- Mom, stop mashing
on my boyfriend!

56:58.371 --> 57:00.155
- How 'bout a beer?
Could you stand a beer? Alright.

57:00.199 --> 57:02.201
- You want a beer?
- He's like a young
Troy Donahue.

57:02.244 --> 57:04.072
- Oh, don't even start.
He thinks he's Steve McQueen!

57:05.509 --> 57:06.988
- Look at that.

57:09.730 --> 57:12.994
- So, what do you think?
- Are you kidding?

57:13.038 --> 57:14.953
He's a doll.

57:14.996 --> 57:17.303
And your father seems
to like him, too.

57:17.346 --> 57:20.045
- Yeah?
- And he's a Pirates fan,
how 'bout that?

57:20.088 --> 57:22.003
- How 'bout that?

57:22.047 --> 57:24.005
: I'm gonna get you!

57:25.050 --> 57:26.878
- So, you think it's okay
if I sleep with him?

57:26.921 --> 57:29.271
- Oh, Molly.
- What?

57:29.315 --> 57:31.970
- You shouldn't be asking
me questions like that.

57:32.013 --> 57:34.842
- Well, I got a new rule.
No lies.

57:34.886 --> 57:38.063
And what good are rules
if you don't use 'em, right?

57:38.106 --> 57:39.760
- Well...

57:41.109 --> 57:43.242
If you want to.

57:44.504 --> 57:46.680
Sure, why not.
You're a big girl.

57:48.334 --> 57:50.423
- I love you, Mom.

57:51.380 --> 57:53.905
- Just don't use your new rule
on your father or your sister,

57:53.948 --> 57:55.863
you know how they are.
- I love you, Mom!

57:55.907 --> 57:58.344
- I heard you the first time.

57:58.387 --> 58:00.259
- See ya!

58:00.302 --> 58:01.826
Bye!

58:04.742 --> 58:06.308
Sweet.

58:15.492 --> 58:18.756
You never told me
your dad was the sheriff.

58:18.799 --> 58:21.062
- If I told guys my dad
was the sheriff,

58:21.106 --> 58:22.499
I'd still be a virgin.

58:40.560 --> 58:43.302
: Looks like
I'll be sticking around
for a while.

58:44.608 --> 58:46.523
- Well, you better.

58:47.480 --> 58:51.266
Or I'll have my dad arrest you
for impersonating my boyfriend.

58:53.791 --> 58:56.620
- Really?
I'm your boyfriend now?

58:57.708 --> 58:59.492
- If you don't screw it up.

59:04.497 --> 59:06.673
- I screwed it up, didn't I?

59:06.717 --> 59:08.719
- You think, John?
John...

59:08.762 --> 59:09.937
Harry!

59:11.548 --> 59:13.941
Steve McQueen! I don't even
know what to call you anymore!

59:13.985 --> 59:16.422
Mr. Nixon says emphatically,

59:16.465 --> 59:18.206
that the White House
is in now way involved

59:18.250 --> 59:21.079
in the burglary and bugging of the Democratic headquarters,

59:21.122 --> 59:23.255
and he'll have no further
comment on that matter.

59:23.298 --> 59:26.214
♪ It's a beautiful morning

59:31.393 --> 59:32.917
: Hot, hot, hot.

59:37.095 --> 59:41.099
♪ Just taking in
some clean fresh air, boy ♪

59:42.927 --> 59:44.276
- Come on!

59:44.319 --> 59:46.365
How does this motherfucking
piece of shit work?!

59:46.408 --> 59:48.106
- Push the lever to the right.

59:48.149 --> 59:50.412
- What lever?
There's only buttons.

59:50.456 --> 59:52.589
- This lever.

59:54.634 --> 59:57.898
- Look at you.
A real Thomas Edison,
boy genius, huh?

59:59.030 --> 1:00:01.249
- What? You don't have
a dishwasher at home?

1:00:01.293 --> 1:00:03.164
- Yeah, I got
a dishwasher at home.

1:00:03.208 --> 1:00:05.166
I married her, fuck nuts!

1:00:06.515 --> 1:00:08.561
: Hey, what's
the mirror for, Uncle Enzo?

1:00:08.605 --> 1:00:11.738
- It's a burglar alarm
for burglars, Tommy.

1:00:14.349 --> 1:00:18.658
If I don't see a reflection,
it means somebody's found
our hole in the roof.

1:00:18.702 --> 1:00:21.922
And then we get the hell
out of dodge.

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:30.888
- I don't think you're meant
to use a knife.

1:00:30.931 --> 1:00:34.282
- Scissors don't work.
The pieces are too thick.

1:00:35.370 --> 1:00:38.069
- Hey, I'm gonna catch
a matinée.

1:00:38.112 --> 1:00:40.462
- Yeah, which one?

1:00:40.506 --> 1:00:43.291
- Getaway.
- Again?

1:00:43.335 --> 1:00:46.164
- Yeah. You wanna come?

1:00:47.731 --> 1:00:50.908
- Nah, nah.
I'm gonna finish this.

1:00:50.951 --> 1:00:52.779
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1:01:04.399 --> 1:01:06.227
: I've seen The Getaway
six times.

1:01:06.271 --> 1:01:09.361
The Thomas Crown Affair,
eight.

1:01:09.404 --> 1:01:11.929
The Magnificent Seven,
I've seen...

1:01:12.886 --> 1:01:13.931
Well, seven.

1:01:15.628 --> 1:01:18.762
You wanna know my favorite?
The movie that I love the most?

1:01:20.894 --> 1:01:22.243
Bullitt.

1:01:52.839 --> 1:01:56.234
- I told Mr. Weakler
that Steve McQueen's your hero.

1:01:56.277 --> 1:01:59.541
And next week, he's gonna play
Bonnie and Clyde.

1:02:00.804 --> 1:02:02.806
Since I've been helping out,
and stuff.

1:02:26.873 --> 1:02:29.441
You okay?
- Yeah.

1:02:30.442 --> 1:02:34.533
I dunno what's wrong with me,
I guess I'm just happy.

1:02:36.274 --> 1:02:39.277
- There's nothing wrong
with being happy.

1:02:46.371 --> 1:02:47.764
- I am.

1:02:49.417 --> 1:02:52.856
I just wish I came here before.

1:02:55.902 --> 1:02:57.425
- What?

1:03:00.733 --> 1:03:01.995
- Nothing.

1:03:10.656 --> 1:03:14.747
- Well, I guess it wasn't
exactly nothing, right?

1:03:18.403 --> 1:03:20.753
'Kay. Keep going.

1:03:23.321 --> 1:03:25.018
- Okay, so...

1:03:25.062 --> 1:03:28.630
We went back
on the Saturday night.

1:03:28.674 --> 1:03:32.591
And that's when
it all started to go...

1:03:32.634 --> 1:03:34.114
...sideways.

1:03:39.119 --> 1:03:40.599
- Heads up.

1:03:41.687 --> 1:03:42.819
Enzo, you read me?

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:45.299
- Yeah Ray, what's going on?

1:03:45.343 --> 1:03:47.562
: Unmarked car
just pulled in the back.

1:03:47.606 --> 1:03:49.086
Coming up.

1:03:51.175 --> 1:03:52.741
- Keep everything quiet.

1:04:01.054 --> 1:04:03.970
: I can fucking
smell an unmarked car,
it's a cop!

1:04:04.014 --> 1:04:05.580
- Calm down.

1:04:05.624 --> 1:04:06.843
Anything on the scanner?

1:04:06.886 --> 1:04:08.279
- No. Not a goddamn thing.

1:04:13.719 --> 1:04:17.462
Look. If it's a cop,
I take him out,

1:04:17.505 --> 1:04:19.203
and we get outta here,
before anyone else shows--

1:04:19.246 --> 1:04:22.293
- We're bank burglars,
not cop killers.

1:04:22.336 --> 1:04:25.035
- It's either that,
or we grow wings,
and fly the fuck away.

1:04:26.775 --> 1:04:28.647
- Okay, okay.

1:04:28.690 --> 1:04:31.432
If it's a cop,
but only...

1:04:31.476 --> 1:04:33.260
if it's a cop.
And no headshot.

1:04:33.304 --> 1:04:34.522
- You can't be serious.

1:04:34.566 --> 1:04:35.654
- You got no vote, here.

1:04:35.697 --> 1:04:37.482
What are you
doing here anyway, Harry?

1:04:37.525 --> 1:04:40.572
Just make sure you give
this son of a bitch
a chance to survive.

1:04:40.615 --> 1:04:42.269
- No promises.

1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:50.103
He's getting out of the car.

1:04:58.155 --> 1:05:01.462
You see that? 12-gauge.
What the fuck did I tell you?

1:05:01.506 --> 1:05:02.550
That's a fucking cop.

1:05:04.596 --> 1:05:06.554
He touches that shotgun,
he dies.

1:05:10.123 --> 1:05:12.473
What the fuck is he doing?

1:05:25.965 --> 1:05:28.315
- If Ray opens up,
we get off this roof doubletime,

1:05:28.359 --> 1:05:29.969
you got me? Pauly first,
then Tommy.

1:05:30.013 --> 1:05:31.971
Harry, me, Ray. Just spread out,

1:05:32.015 --> 1:05:33.799
and get back to the house
as fast as you can.

1:05:33.842 --> 1:05:35.409
- Why don't we just leave
right now?

1:05:35.453 --> 1:05:36.845
What if somebody needs--

1:05:36.889 --> 1:05:38.151
- I said you got no vote!

1:05:38.195 --> 1:05:40.110
You do as I say,
or you're going off the roof.

1:05:40.153 --> 1:05:41.807
Head first!

1:05:41.850 --> 1:05:43.330
Is that clear? You got that?

1:05:47.552 --> 1:05:50.903
- Hold on. Hey, hey.
What the fuck is this?

1:05:56.126 --> 1:05:57.954
- Who are these assholes?

1:06:03.350 --> 1:06:05.831
- Somebody wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

1:06:16.102 --> 1:06:17.843
woman: Hey!

1:06:20.715 --> 1:06:23.066
- It's a little league game!

1:06:23.109 --> 1:06:25.590
- Shit!
- Son of a bitch!

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:29.333
I almost shot the fucking
little league.

1:06:29.376 --> 1:06:30.638
Fuck.

1:06:30.682 --> 1:06:32.814
- Calm down. Hey, whoa, whoa!
- What the fuck!

1:06:32.858 --> 1:06:34.991
- Put the gun down,
put the gun down.
Don't worry about it.

1:06:35.034 --> 1:06:36.993
: D'you get a hit today?
: No, I struck out.

1:06:37.036 --> 1:06:38.820
- Don't worry.
You'll get it next time.

1:06:38.864 --> 1:06:42.346
: That's when I knew
that I was in over my head.

1:06:42.389 --> 1:06:45.523
That I'd made a terrible
mistake.

1:07:04.716 --> 1:07:05.934
- Let's finish this.

1:07:07.632 --> 1:07:10.243
- I'm so full.
I can't eat anymore.

1:07:12.941 --> 1:07:15.988
- The story. Finish the story.

1:07:19.165 --> 1:07:20.993
- So, it was Sunday night.

1:07:22.429 --> 1:07:24.779
The third time
returning to the bank.

1:07:45.583 --> 1:07:46.758
- Heads up.

1:07:48.151 --> 1:07:49.413
Enzo, you read me?

1:07:50.718 --> 1:07:52.111
- Yeah, Ray, what's up?

1:07:52.155 --> 1:07:53.721
- It is getting busy out here.

1:07:53.765 --> 1:07:55.810
It's definitely
a Monday morning,
you know what I mean?

1:07:55.854 --> 1:07:57.812
- Yeah. I know
what fucking day it is.

1:08:02.861 --> 1:08:05.951
: Pack it up, boys.
Bring it all up the ladder,
we're done.

1:08:06.604 --> 1:08:08.606
- Since when do you run
this crew?

1:08:08.649 --> 1:08:10.129
- Since you lost
your goddamn fucking mind.

1:08:10.173 --> 1:08:12.305
And to be honest,

1:08:12.349 --> 1:08:14.307
I don't think your goddamn
fucking 30 mil is here.

1:08:14.351 --> 1:08:16.309
Even if it is, it's time to go.

1:08:17.745 --> 1:08:19.573
- Shit!

1:08:19.617 --> 1:08:21.793
Fucking asshole, Nixon!

1:08:21.836 --> 1:08:24.230
- Hey. We did our best.

1:08:25.927 --> 1:08:27.973
- Guys like him,
they always come out on top.

1:08:28.016 --> 1:08:30.367
They always come out on top!

1:08:30.410 --> 1:08:32.543
They're gonna make fucking
statues of him!

1:08:32.586 --> 1:08:35.415
And they're gonna plaster
his dog-ass face

1:08:35.459 --> 1:08:37.896
on first class fucking stamps!

1:08:37.939 --> 1:08:41.160
Guys like me and you,
he is a bigger crook

1:08:41.204 --> 1:08:43.815
than we will ever fucking be!

1:08:45.773 --> 1:08:49.864
- Maybe someday,
someone will nail
something on him. Okay?

1:08:49.908 --> 1:08:52.911
Hope springs eternal. Right?

1:08:53.999 --> 1:08:58.046
- Never fucking happened, Pauly.
Never.

1:08:58.090 --> 1:09:00.571
- Let's just get the fuck
out of here.

1:09:14.106 --> 1:09:16.456
- That's what a 12-million
dollar boat looks like, boys.

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.415
- Next stop, Vegas.

1:09:18.458 --> 1:09:19.938
: Lake Havasu.

1:09:21.244 --> 1:09:23.942
Get that money in there.
Hurry up. Boom.

1:09:24.899 --> 1:09:26.858
- Pauly, did you get that bleach
in the drains?

1:09:26.901 --> 1:09:28.120
- All done, boss.

1:09:28.164 --> 1:09:30.209
- Ray, all the countertops,
right?

1:09:30.253 --> 1:09:31.819
- Yep. Spick and span.

1:09:31.863 --> 1:09:33.169
- Harry.

1:09:37.434 --> 1:09:39.827
Here's your cut, and Tommy's.

1:09:41.655 --> 1:09:43.527
I'll see you back in Youngstown.

1:10:16.647 --> 1:10:18.736
- There's only 20 000.

1:10:20.303 --> 1:10:24.263
12-million dollar heist...
And all we get is 10k apiece.

1:10:24.307 --> 1:10:26.309
- You can have my cut,
I don't care.

1:10:26.352 --> 1:10:27.875
- Well, I care, Tommy.

1:10:34.752 --> 1:10:36.188
You okay?

1:10:37.537 --> 1:10:39.539
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:10:41.976 --> 1:10:43.543
- What you got there?

1:10:43.587 --> 1:10:45.719
- Baseball cards.

1:10:45.763 --> 1:10:48.461
It's from the bank,
Enzo said I could have it.

1:10:49.070 --> 1:10:50.376
- Any gum?

1:10:50.420 --> 1:10:52.509
- No, just cards.

1:10:53.336 --> 1:10:54.641
- Jesus Christ.

1:10:54.685 --> 1:10:57.340
- Well, I got a Johnny Bench
MVP card in here.

1:10:57.383 --> 1:10:58.863
- Good, Tommy.

1:11:00.430 --> 1:11:02.736
12-million dollar heist,
and all we get is 10k,

1:11:02.780 --> 1:11:05.043
and some gum-less
baseball cards.

1:11:05.086 --> 1:11:06.740
Let's go, Tommy.

1:11:26.586 --> 1:11:29.981
- Excuse me, sir? Sir?

1:11:30.024 --> 1:11:31.722
I've got something.

1:11:34.246 --> 1:11:37.684
C.W. Colson is
Charles Wendell Colson,

1:11:37.728 --> 1:11:39.338
a.k.a. Chuck Colson.

1:11:39.382 --> 1:11:41.688
Date of birth, 10/16/1931.

1:11:41.732 --> 1:11:45.779
The P.O. box is actually
a mail drop a couple of miles
from his house in Arlington.

1:11:45.823 --> 1:11:47.390
Married twice, three kids.

1:11:47.433 --> 1:11:49.392
He did a hitch
in the Marine Corps.
It's quite a resume.

1:11:49.435 --> 1:11:50.915
- What does Mr. Colson
do for a living?

1:11:50.958 --> 1:11:54.048
- Special Counsel to the
President of the United States.

1:11:54.788 --> 1:11:55.746
- Nixon?

1:11:59.402 --> 1:12:00.533
- Oh.

1:12:02.622 --> 1:12:04.058
Got it.

1:12:10.064 --> 1:12:11.239
Got it.

1:12:16.593 --> 1:12:17.855
- Tommy?

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:22.425
When we get back home,

1:12:22.468 --> 1:12:25.210
we're not working
for Enzo anymore.

1:12:31.129 --> 1:12:35.394
- Yeah, but...
I mean, he's our uncle.
He's family, Harry.

1:12:35.438 --> 1:12:38.223
- He doesn't care about us, Tom.

1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:44.229
- So, what are we gonna do?

1:12:44.272 --> 1:12:45.839
- We'll figure something out.

1:12:48.755 --> 1:12:50.148
You and me.

1:13:05.032 --> 1:13:06.425
- Hmm.

1:13:09.123 --> 1:13:10.516
Got it.

1:13:16.087 --> 1:13:18.611
- Good morning, sir.
- I spoke with Mr. Colson.

1:13:18.655 --> 1:13:23.007
He said all he had
in his safe-deposit box
was an album of baseball cards.

1:13:23.050 --> 1:13:26.445
He estimates a value
of between $200-$300.

1:13:26.489 --> 1:13:28.316
- Baseball cards.

1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:31.058
- Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio,
so on and so forth.

1:13:31.102 --> 1:13:33.670
He said he would try and
recollect all the cards he had,

1:13:33.713 --> 1:13:35.411
and send me a complete list.

1:13:35.454 --> 1:13:37.413
- We're supposed
to believe that, sir?

1:13:37.456 --> 1:13:39.589
That he had an album full
of baseball cards

1:13:39.632 --> 1:13:43.157
in a safe-deposit box
3000 miles away?

1:13:43.201 --> 1:13:44.376
- Well, Howard,

1:13:44.420 --> 1:13:46.334
we have to take Mr. Colson
at his word,

1:13:46.378 --> 1:13:48.467
that's all
we can do at the moment.

1:13:48.511 --> 1:13:50.991
- I'd like to talk to Mr. Colson
if that's okay with you, sir.

1:13:51.035 --> 1:13:53.037
- No. I'm afraid not.

1:13:54.081 --> 1:13:55.953
Neither you, or anyone
on your team

1:13:55.996 --> 1:13:58.782
is to have any contact
with Mr. Colson,
is that clear?

1:13:58.825 --> 1:14:00.436
- How am I supposed to
conduct this investigation--

1:14:00.479 --> 1:14:02.350
- Sometimes smoking guns
are too hot to handle, Howard.

1:14:02.394 --> 1:14:03.830
You have to give them time
to cool down.

1:14:03.874 --> 1:14:05.528
- Cool down?

1:14:06.964 --> 1:14:09.227
- You read the Washington Post,
Howard?

1:14:09.270 --> 1:14:10.620
- No, sir.

1:14:10.663 --> 1:14:12.012
- You should.

1:14:12.056 --> 1:14:14.711
There's an article
by a couple of young reporters

1:14:14.754 --> 1:14:17.496
Woodward and Bernstein.

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:19.150
You might find it interesting.

1:14:19.759 --> 1:14:21.587
Bye for now, Howard.

1:14:22.327 --> 1:14:23.546
- Get me the Washington Post.

1:14:23.589 --> 1:14:26.287
Tag an article
by Woodward and Bernstein.

1:14:58.842 --> 1:15:00.931
Sharon, you see this?
- Yes, sir.

1:15:00.974 --> 1:15:03.324
- I want each and every house
on the entire hillside

1:15:03.368 --> 1:15:05.239
checked out, door to door.
And I want it done today.

1:15:16.599 --> 1:15:18.252
Looks like we drilled
a dry hole.

1:15:18.296 --> 1:15:20.124
Maybe I was wrong
about that mirror.

1:15:20.167 --> 1:15:23.344
- The house was rented
under the name "Steve McQueen."

1:15:23.388 --> 1:15:24.737
That has to mean something.

1:15:24.781 --> 1:15:27.044
- Female intuition
should be admissible evidence.

1:15:28.828 --> 1:15:30.526
Karen had great instincts too.

1:15:55.159 --> 1:15:56.987
- Men.

1:15:59.642 --> 1:16:01.992
I've got fingerprints
in the kitchen!

1:16:02.035 --> 1:16:04.995
It's a crew out of Youngstown,
Ohio. Enzo Rotella,

1:16:05.038 --> 1:16:08.041
Paul Callahan,
and Raymond Darrow.

1:16:08.085 --> 1:16:10.130
- That's only three suspects,
we found five sets
of fingerprints.

1:16:10.174 --> 1:16:12.611
- Yeah, well I've got our guys
working on it in double shifts
around the clock.

1:16:12.655 --> 1:16:13.743
- Excellent work.

1:16:16.136 --> 1:16:17.747
- We still have two sets
of fingerprints

1:16:17.790 --> 1:16:20.097
we haven't ID'd yet, sir.
- You will.

1:16:21.707 --> 1:16:23.100
Howard, let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

1:16:23.143 --> 1:16:24.623
You look like you could use one.

1:16:26.494 --> 1:16:29.193
You were up in Sacramento
before you came to Santa Ana,
weren't you?

1:16:29.236 --> 1:16:33.980
- Yes, sir. And Boise.
And Minneapolis before that.

1:16:35.242 --> 1:16:36.722
Amongst many others.

1:16:38.506 --> 1:16:41.422
- Well, I think it's time
you had your final transfer.

1:16:41.466 --> 1:16:44.295
It's time you came
to Washington, DC.

1:16:44.338 --> 1:16:45.688
- Sir?

1:16:47.124 --> 1:16:49.387
- I need a man who can work
the halls of power,

1:16:49.430 --> 1:16:52.172
without being awestruck
by the architecture, Howard.

1:16:54.479 --> 1:16:56.960
Tell me. How are you
and the missus getting on
these days?

1:16:57.003 --> 1:16:58.570
- Working things out.

1:16:59.876 --> 1:17:01.442
- Glad to hear that.

1:17:02.487 --> 1:17:04.010
And how would she feel

1:17:04.054 --> 1:17:06.447
if I asked you to move
your family to Washington?

1:17:08.667 --> 1:17:11.017
- She wouldn't like it,
but for this,

1:17:11.061 --> 1:17:12.584
I think she'd understand.

1:17:12.628 --> 1:17:15.108
- Good. You got three weeks.

1:17:15.152 --> 1:17:16.544
- Three weeks?

1:17:16.588 --> 1:17:17.807
- That should be ample time

1:17:17.850 --> 1:17:19.547
for you to finish up
with this case.

1:17:20.592 --> 1:17:22.942
You have to hand it to them,
these fellows from Youngstown,

1:17:22.986 --> 1:17:25.075
they certainly upset
the applecart, didn't they?

1:17:25.118 --> 1:17:27.512
- And whose applecart
was that, sir?

1:17:27.555 --> 1:17:30.950
- Well, you'll have to ask them
what they were looking for,
and who it belonged to.

1:17:30.994 --> 1:17:33.605
That way you can say
you didn't hear it from me.

1:17:33.649 --> 1:17:35.302
Which you haven't.

1:17:35.346 --> 1:17:37.043
It'll give us something
to talk about

1:17:37.087 --> 1:17:38.828
when you get to Washington, DC.

1:17:43.093 --> 1:17:44.877
: They flew
from Cleveland to Los Angeles

1:17:44.921 --> 1:17:47.750
under their real names.
Enzo Rotella, Paul Callahan,

1:17:47.793 --> 1:17:49.752
Ray Darrow, and two brothers.

1:17:49.795 --> 1:17:51.362
Harry and Tommy Barber.

1:17:51.405 --> 1:17:53.103
Tommy served a tour
in Vietnam.

1:17:53.146 --> 1:17:55.235
We tracked his prints
to the U.S. Army database.

1:17:55.279 --> 1:17:57.150
- And Harry Barber?
You got his photo?

1:17:57.194 --> 1:17:59.065
- There's nothing in our system.
He's probably the first
set of prints

1:17:59.109 --> 1:18:00.414
that we haven't ID'd yet.

1:18:00.458 --> 1:18:03.591
But take a look at this.

1:18:03.635 --> 1:18:07.726
Hertz rented
a 1972 Cadillac DeVille

1:18:07.770 --> 1:18:10.294
to a customer named
"Steve McQueen".

1:18:10.990 --> 1:18:13.079
The car was paid for
in hundred-dollar bills,

1:18:13.123 --> 1:18:14.864
and returned in Las Vegas.

1:18:14.907 --> 1:18:17.649
- So, they all escaped
to Las Vegas?

1:18:18.694 --> 1:18:20.086
- Maybe not all.

1:18:20.130 --> 1:18:21.958
A neighbor reported
seeing two men getting picked up

1:18:22.001 --> 1:18:24.395
in a cab outside
of a vacation house.

1:18:24.438 --> 1:18:27.964
So, I check the local taxi logs,
and guess who I found?

1:18:28.921 --> 1:18:30.618
- Steve McQueen.

1:18:30.662 --> 1:18:33.578
- Driver got a hell of a tip,
too. Hundred-dollar bill.

1:18:34.622 --> 1:18:36.581
- And nobody knows about this
but you and me?

1:18:36.624 --> 1:18:38.757
- Just you and me, sir.
- Okay.

1:18:38.801 --> 1:18:41.020
I want to inspect
that taxi cab myself.

1:18:41.064 --> 1:18:42.979
Don't let anybody touch it.
- Yes, sir.

1:18:43.022 --> 1:18:44.328
- Gonna stay here?
- Yes.

1:18:44.371 --> 1:18:45.764
- Okay.
Let's put out a bulletin

1:18:45.808 --> 1:18:48.375
to all the local P.D.'s
nationwide

1:18:48.419 --> 1:18:49.942
for misdemeanor fingerprints.

1:18:49.986 --> 1:18:53.293
See if we can't tag
this Harry J. Barber.

1:18:54.425 --> 1:18:58.081
And if we can't find him,
find me Steve McQueen.

1:19:42.168 --> 1:19:43.561
Colson.

1:19:59.011 --> 1:20:03.146
- Is it always like that, or...
Do you get used to it?

1:20:04.712 --> 1:20:06.323
- It's always like that.

1:20:07.715 --> 1:20:09.717
- How did I not notice this?

1:20:10.762 --> 1:20:13.765
- 'Cause whenever it got bad...

1:20:13.809 --> 1:20:15.636
...I got really scared,

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:17.595
I'd pretend I was someone else.

1:20:19.684 --> 1:20:22.121
Someone that could
keep their cool no matter what.

1:20:22.165 --> 1:20:23.862
Even if the cops showed up.

1:20:25.429 --> 1:20:26.865
- Let me guess.

1:20:27.561 --> 1:20:29.172
- Steve McQueen.

1:20:29.215 --> 1:20:30.826
- 41 outstanding
speeding tickets,

1:20:30.869 --> 1:20:33.045
all paid two weeks
before the heist.

1:20:33.089 --> 1:20:35.265
Did a year long
stint in juvie.

1:20:35.308 --> 1:20:37.571
It's all we've got on him
at the moment.

1:20:37.615 --> 1:20:39.443
- Let's call
the Cleveland office.

1:20:40.270 --> 1:20:41.837
Tell them it's showtime.

1:20:45.101 --> 1:20:46.580
Agent Price.

1:20:47.494 --> 1:20:48.582
You coming?

1:21:30.407 --> 1:21:32.061
- Fuck!

1:21:36.804 --> 1:21:38.110
- Yeah.

1:21:57.608 --> 1:21:59.218
- Where's Harry Barber?

1:21:59.262 --> 1:22:00.785
- Harry who?

1:22:02.743 --> 1:22:04.528
- It's just a matter of time.

1:22:04.571 --> 1:22:06.791
- A matter of time.

1:22:08.662 --> 1:22:10.795
We'll see about that.

1:22:12.884 --> 1:22:14.842
- Let's go.

1:22:14.886 --> 1:22:19.369
: ... slowing down,
or even some suggested,
resigning.

1:22:19.412 --> 1:22:22.633
Any suggestion...

1:22:22.676 --> 1:22:25.114
...that this president
is ever going to leave
this office

1:22:25.157 --> 1:22:29.553
until he continues
to do the job, and finishes
the job he was elected to do,

1:22:29.596 --> 1:22:34.166
anyone who suggests that,
that's just plain poppycock.

1:22:47.788 --> 1:22:51.575
- I got two of the same.
Take it.

1:23:00.279 --> 1:23:03.587
- I'm going to the store.
You want anything?

1:23:05.067 --> 1:23:06.982
- More baseball cards.

1:23:09.941 --> 1:23:11.421
- Okay, Tommy.

1:23:13.814 --> 1:23:15.729
- I love you, Harry.

1:23:24.347 --> 1:23:25.739
- Where'd that come from?

1:23:28.438 --> 1:23:29.830
- I don't know.

1:23:31.136 --> 1:23:33.791
- I love you too, Tommy.

1:25:02.706 --> 1:25:05.578
: That was the last time I saw my little brother.

1:25:07.537 --> 1:25:12.324
I left Youngstown that day,
and I've been running
ever since.

1:25:16.328 --> 1:25:18.809
But I'm done running now,
Molly.

1:25:18.852 --> 1:25:20.158
- No, you're not.

1:25:20.202 --> 1:25:21.855
We'll go to Mexico together.

1:25:21.899 --> 1:25:23.074
- I called your father
this morning.

1:25:23.118 --> 1:25:24.641
He'll be here any minute.

1:25:27.209 --> 1:25:28.166
- No. Come on!

1:25:28.210 --> 1:25:30.081
- Molly. Molly, what are you--

1:25:32.301 --> 1:25:34.259
Please. Molly!

1:25:35.565 --> 1:25:38.176
Hey! Where are you going?

1:25:38.220 --> 1:25:39.917
- My motorcycle.

1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:42.049
- You're gonna ride it
all the way to Mexico?

1:25:42.093 --> 1:25:43.747
- Canada. It's only five hours
to the border.

1:25:43.790 --> 1:25:45.227
You know anyone in Toronto?

1:25:45.270 --> 1:25:47.185
- No, and neither do you, Molly.
- Okay then, whatever!

1:25:47.229 --> 1:25:48.882
We'll go on the run,
like Bonnie and Clyde!

1:25:56.890 --> 1:26:00.329
- Wait a minute.
Didn't Bonnie and Clyde
get shot to death?

1:26:00.372 --> 1:26:01.591
- Oh yeah.

1:26:05.856 --> 1:26:07.336
- He's not gonna run, is he?

1:26:07.379 --> 1:26:09.903
'Cause I've been chasing
this guy for a long time.

1:26:09.947 --> 1:26:11.949
- He's not going anywhere.

1:26:13.516 --> 1:26:15.605
Tell your men to stand down.

1:26:16.432 --> 1:26:17.911
- Stand down!

1:26:19.522 --> 1:26:23.178
- No more lies.
That's my new rule.

1:26:37.409 --> 1:26:40.282
- I'll wait for you. Okay?

1:26:40.325 --> 1:26:42.632
I'll wait for you forever.

1:26:43.850 --> 1:26:45.069
- How 'bout five to ten years?

1:26:46.375 --> 1:26:47.854
- It's time to go, Harry.

1:27:03.914 --> 1:27:05.916
- You really think
there's happily ever after

1:27:05.959 --> 1:27:07.483
for people like us?

1:27:10.007 --> 1:27:12.357
- Faye Dunaway said that.

1:27:12.401 --> 1:27:13.967
- To Steve McQueen.

1:27:14.011 --> 1:27:16.231
- In The Thomas Crown Affair.
