WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:03.101
- It's the last day
of our auditions, Moira.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.870
We might have to lower
our standards

00:04.872 --> 00:06.305
if we're gonna find our lead.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.308
- Lowering your standards
is a slippery slope, Jocelyn.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.042
Next thing I know
you'll be telling me

00:11.078 --> 00:12.578
we'll be staging
this production

00:12.713 --> 00:15.313
at the school gymnasium.

00:15.315 --> 00:18.383
(Gasps) Very dapper, Mr. Rose!

00:18.452 --> 00:21.386
Like the maestro
of a Lebanese orchestra.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.921
- Congratulations Johnny,

00:23.057 --> 00:24.989
I never thought I'd see
this little motel

00:25.026 --> 00:26.792
recognized for anything,

00:26.794 --> 00:29.261
besides the occasional
cockroach!

00:29.330 --> 00:32.531
(Laughs) I made myself
laugh there.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.767
- Well, always nice to be
nominated, Jocelyn.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.069
but I'm not putting too much
stock in...

00:37.071 --> 00:39.038
regional hospitality awards.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.072
- The revisions for your
acceptance speech

00:41.108 --> 00:42.407
are on the vanity, dear.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.975
- Oh thank you, sweetheart.

00:44.045 --> 00:47.212
So how's the uh,
casting hunt going?

00:47.214 --> 00:49.081
- Oh, disconsolate, John.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.750
We may be looking at putting
an ad in broadwayworld.com.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.352
Perhaps there's a chorus girl
on holiday,

00:54.354 --> 00:55.754
looking for a leg up.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.189
- Okay, hi!

00:57.324 --> 00:58.890
First of all,
I'd like to remind you

00:58.959 --> 01:01.093
that this is a live-work space,

01:01.162 --> 01:03.162
and second, fine, I'll do it.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.696
- Do what, dear?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.632
- I'll step in as the star
of your musical.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.434
- No!

01:08.569 --> 01:11.570
No, with your responsibilities
as our in-house publicist,

01:11.639 --> 01:13.972
I couldn't ask you
to do that now.

01:14.008 --> 01:15.774
- Okay, well, you seem
pretty desperate,

01:15.909 --> 01:17.242
so I'm happy to help.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.677
Johnny: Well Moira,
I'd consider it.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.278
I mean, we did spend
all that money

01:20.314 --> 01:22.514
flying in Barbara Streisand's
vocal coach

01:22.583 --> 01:26.318
that summer Alexis wanted to be
the next Jessica Simpson.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.853
- Alexis, a brief stint
on a reality show,

01:28.889 --> 01:31.790
that's one thing, but...
acting, that's--

01:31.792 --> 01:33.725
- Um, the producers
of "A Little Bit Alexis"

01:33.794 --> 01:35.594
insisted that I take
acting classes

01:35.663 --> 01:37.262
after we started shooting, so.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.598
- Almost makes me want
to try out for it myself.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.701
- Okay, now we're all just
getting the sillies.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.671
Best we stick to our
award-nominated day jobs.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.739
- Well, I'm sure that Alexis
has a song

01:47.741 --> 01:49.741
that she could sing
for the audition.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.409
- Audition?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.544
Okay, do I have to remind you

01:52.546 --> 01:54.212
about the album
that I released?

01:54.348 --> 01:56.415
- Moira, what's the worst
that can happen?

01:56.550 --> 01:59.618
- Besides the inevitable
accusations of nepotism!

01:59.687 --> 02:01.086
- Well, for what it's worth,
Alexis,

02:01.221 --> 02:03.155
I always thought
"Hampton's Hoes"

02:03.290 --> 02:04.957
was quite catchy.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.593
- Boop! (Humming)

02:09.329 --> 02:14.099
♪♪♪

02:15.202 --> 02:16.768
(Door opens)

02:16.804 --> 02:18.303
Johnny: Oh, Stevie.

02:18.438 --> 02:20.004
You look very nice.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.307
- No, I don't.
- Uh, yes, you do!

02:22.376 --> 02:25.644
Very spiffy!
That's a lovely dress.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.845
- I literally pulled it out
of the laundry, Mr. Rose.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.648
I've had it forever.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.115
- You know it's not
a bad thing to admit

02:31.152 --> 02:35.387
you really care about
these awards, Stevie.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.489
You're bringing a bag?

02:37.624 --> 02:40.459
You know, I almost brought
a change of clothes myself.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.194
Moira told me to pack
a second suit

02:42.196 --> 02:43.862
for the afterparty, but uh,

02:43.864 --> 02:45.863
who am I, George Clooney?
(Chuckles)

02:45.900 --> 02:47.966
- No, Mr. Rose,
that's a weekend bag.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.001
I'm going away for the weekend.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.103
- Oh.

02:51.105 --> 02:53.438
- I told you I'm taking
Monday off!

02:53.440 --> 02:56.341
- Yeah, but I didn't know
you were going someplace.

02:56.476 --> 02:59.678
- Uh, Emir is presenting
at the awards,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.547
so I just thought I might
drive around with him

03:02.616 --> 03:04.283
for a few days after.

03:04.418 --> 03:08.620
- Oh... so it sounds like
you two are getting...

03:08.656 --> 03:10.322
pretty serious?

03:10.324 --> 03:13.425
- Uh, I guess we'll see
what happens this weekend.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.560
Roland: Hello, guys, uh...

03:15.629 --> 03:17.596
whoa! (Chuckles)

03:17.731 --> 03:19.198
Look at us! Who are we?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.066
Brad Pitt and his
handsome brother?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.834
And Johnny?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.235
- Why the jacket, Roland?

03:24.271 --> 03:25.970
You know you're not going
to the awards.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.307
- Johnny, you asked me
to manage the motel

03:28.442 --> 03:29.708
while you were away.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.309
I'm not gonna show up
just dressed

03:31.345 --> 03:33.712
like some schlub off the street!

03:33.714 --> 03:35.280
- Like you do every day?

03:35.349 --> 03:38.116
- Wow, okay.
This one puts on a dress

03:38.152 --> 03:40.518
and suddenly she's Rita Rudner.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.854
Guys, I am really gonna
miss this...

03:42.856 --> 03:44.389
workplace banter.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.324
- We are coming back, Roland.
- Oh.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.461
- At least I'm coming back,
I don't know about Stevie.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.229
- Oh my God,
we should really get going.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.431
- How about one picture
before we go?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.333
Roland: Great idea, okay.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.835
Stevie, do you mind?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.069
Here we go.

03:58.105 --> 04:01.607
- I meant a picture
of me and Stevie.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.643
- Absolutely, no,
that makes perfect sense.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.177
(Laughs) Okay.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.079
And everybody...

04:08.115 --> 04:09.815
- Put Mr. Rose in it.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.516
(Camera clicks)

04:11.552 --> 04:13.551
- I just don't get the big
reveal, it's a bathroom.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.954
- It's not just a bathroom,
David, it's a passion project.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.622
- I'd kill to be that
passionate about a bathroom

04:17.691 --> 04:19.090
that you've now decided
to open up

04:19.126 --> 04:20.425
to the entire town.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.226
- Yeah well, we can't afford
to keep a private bathroom,

04:22.263 --> 04:24.395
David, we're losing customers
to the cafe.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.231
Besides, you're the one
who started serving booze

04:26.233 --> 04:27.565
at those evening events.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.567
- Um, those evening events
are part of a summer series.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.169
- Oh...
- We sold 30 dreamcatchers

04:31.171 --> 04:32.970
at that Cosmic Meditation
Clinic.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.439
- Huh.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.809
(Bell on door jingles)

04:37.811 --> 04:39.711
- Yeah, you know what?
You were right.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.113
It does look beautiful.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.247
- What the f...
- So, I'm confused.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.883
Where does the bathroom start,

04:45.018 --> 04:46.718
and all this garbage end?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.586
- Ronnie swore this would
be done today.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.122
Ronnie: Yep, but you ran out
of tiles.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.694
It doesn't help that you picked
the most expensive ones.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.562
- Okay, you asked for
my opinion,

04:57.564 --> 04:59.664
I don't know how much
Romanian marble costs!

04:59.667 --> 05:01.733
- I was hoping to get
my hands on a few more

05:01.735 --> 05:05.037
in an hour or so, but that is
TBC at this point.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.472
- Okay, Ronnie, uh,
this installation

05:07.474 --> 05:09.407
was just supposed to last
two days.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.342
And now half of our store
is covered in tarps,

05:11.378 --> 05:13.011
and David's organized some
writers' retreat

05:13.146 --> 05:15.747
for tomorrow night.
- It's a calligraphy workshop.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.249
- We're working as fast
as we can,

05:18.319 --> 05:20.151
you have my cell!

05:21.555 --> 05:23.421
- Could you have not at least
asked her to finesse the tarps?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.290
I mean, there's green tape
everywhere!

05:26.527 --> 05:27.959
- The tarps aren't staying up,
David.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.494
This bathroom's getting
finished today,

05:29.629 --> 05:30.762
because that's what
we discussed,

05:30.897 --> 05:32.363
that's what's gonna happen.
- Okay,

05:32.399 --> 05:34.032
it's just that you waited
until after she left

05:34.167 --> 05:36.034
to put your lil' foot down,
so I'm just not sure

05:36.169 --> 05:37.436
if she's aware of that plan.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.303
- She obviously thinks
we're a couple of pushovers.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.173
- Okay, speak for yourself.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.108
All I did was pick out
some gorgeous tile.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.409
(Patrick laughs wryly)

05:44.544 --> 05:45.777
(Birds chirp)

05:45.912 --> 05:47.346
- I'm pregnant.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.517
That's it, that's the end
of my audition.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.853
- Indeed it is.
- I'm fine with nudity.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.521
- Not necessary.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.023
Thank you.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.928
- She looks like she may
have seen the inside

06:03.063 --> 06:05.663
of a smoky German bar or two.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.066
Who knows, a haircut,
some dance lessons...

06:08.135 --> 06:09.868
- Moira, I feel like
we're really scraping

06:09.937 --> 06:11.136
the bottom of the barrel here.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.204
I think that we should
bring Alexis in.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.141
- Jabberwocky! There are still
stones left unturned!

06:16.143 --> 06:18.043
- Okay, you're actively
trying to prevent

06:18.045 --> 06:20.479
Alexis from auditioning here,
and I don't want to get

06:20.481 --> 06:22.614
in the middle of some mother
daughter competition thing,

06:22.616 --> 06:24.816
- Competition!
Nothing of the sort.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.685
No, Alexis just doesn't
have the...

06:27.721 --> 06:29.588
life experience.
- Really?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.156
Because according
to her stories...

06:31.158 --> 06:33.392
- Well, she's had her fair
share of adventures, yes.

06:33.527 --> 06:37.028
But the role of Sally Bowles
requires an actress

06:37.030 --> 06:39.698
who can mine a deeper,
darker cave.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.099
A woman encumbered with secrets
she will...

06:42.136 --> 06:44.035
take with her to the tomb.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.971
Hence the high praise
Gina Gershon and I

06:46.106 --> 06:47.906
received for the role.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.507
- You know what, Moira?

06:49.543 --> 06:50.842
I'm gonna bring Alexis in.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.078
And don't worry,
I will handle the audition,

06:53.213 --> 06:55.446
so it is less of a struggle
for you.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.482

that's the big one.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

07:08.728 --> 07:11.396
Stevie, if we win,

07:11.465 --> 07:14.166

any talking up there?

07:19.473 --> 07:22.006

maybe.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.309
Johnny Rose, but I'm sure
you remember me, Emir,

07:24.444 --> 07:26.611
You declared our motel
a "must stay".

07:26.746 --> 07:29.014
- How could I forget, Mr. Rose,
good to see you.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.448
And you are?

07:30.583 --> 07:31.816
- Uh, I'm just waiting
for my date.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.184
So that seat's taken.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.686
- Oh, well, can I uh... buy you
a drink while you wait?

07:35.688 --> 07:37.489
- I guess, but he won't be
too happy about it.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.457
- From what I've heard,
he'll take what he can get.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.459
so you're probably safe.
- I should point out,

07:41.462 --> 07:43.828
they have been coming by
with drink trays.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.430
- Oh yeah, we'll just go
to the bar.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.634
- Okay, well, I'm sure you have
some catching up to do.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.463
and she told me multiple times,

08:18.598 --> 08:20.398
not to talk to anyone.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.000
Especially while
they're eating.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.535
So I'm gonna just...

08:24.571 --> 08:26.404
(Patrick sighs)

08:29.543 --> 08:31.209
Roland: Oh hey, Pat.
What are you doing?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.811
Playing hooky,
or did the store finally close?

08:33.947 --> 08:35.180
- (Laughs)

08:35.182 --> 08:37.382
I don't laugh a lot,
but that was good.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.651
- That is funny, especially
considering we are open,

08:39.786 --> 08:40.886
but hey, who knows
for how long?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.820
Because right now,
it sorta looks like

08:42.822 --> 08:44.355
a quarantine station.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.024
- I'm sorry, are you
implying something?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.392
- You know, I'm just saying,

08:47.461 --> 08:49.027
uh, the bathroom's supposed
to be done today,

08:49.096 --> 08:50.829
and you say you're working
as fast as you can,

08:50.964 --> 08:52.998
but uh, here I find you
with Roland.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.899
- Okay, FYI.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.367
Roland is the hook-up
for your tiles.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.036
His cousin, Arnie,
gets them at cost.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.306
So I thought I would thank
Roland by buying him lunch.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.075
Because that's how
I do business.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.513
- Makes sense.
I was just sort of uh...

09:09.550 --> 09:11.182
checking in.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.850
- I could always cancel
the order,

09:12.852 --> 09:14.653
if that's how you wanna do
business.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.887
Roland: Ooh! Ouch.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.922
I would run out and get
some aloe vera pal,

09:17.958 --> 09:20.291
'cause you just got burned.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.193
- Hi, is everything okay?

09:22.329 --> 09:24.362
- I don't know, you tell me.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.798
- Yeah, no, I was just uh,
telling Ronnie what a...

09:26.800 --> 09:29.334
what a great job she's doing
on the bathroom.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.136
And uh, we should get back
to the store.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.937
- Okay, do you still need
to use the restroom?

09:33.006 --> 09:35.206
- What? Nope!
Uh, came here for you.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.409
So... we should go.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.379
- Thanks for checking in.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.348
- Is everything okay?
You look more pale than normal.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.150
(Birds chirp)

09:46.219 --> 09:47.551
- Okay.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.220
Hi, my name is Alexis Rose,

09:49.289 --> 09:51.389
represented by
Alexis Rose Talent.

09:51.524 --> 09:55.160
- Okay, what are you gonna be
singing for us today, Alexis?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.195
- I have chosen to perform
the title track

09:57.264 --> 10:00.431
off of my critically reviewed,
limited reality series,

10:00.467 --> 10:02.033
"A Little Bit Alexis."
- Ooh!

10:02.069 --> 10:04.168
- Feel free to sing along
if you know the words.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.371

10:59.993 --> 11:02.827
I think that just that
30 seconds is...

11:02.863 --> 11:05.697
more than enough
to go off of, yeah.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.298
- Are you saying I booked it?

11:07.434 --> 11:09.300
- Great question! Jocelyn?

11:10.370 --> 11:13.972
- Well, we do have to see
all the other candidates.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.409
But we will definitely
get back to you.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.611

Oooh! (Giggles)

- Oh...

11:26.186 --> 11:27.785
(Sighs)

11:27.921 --> 11:29.253
- So what do we think?

11:29.255 --> 11:32.691
- Well, there is a place
for her... somewhere.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.894
- On stage?!
- No!

11:36.029 --> 11:38.863
Moira, I saw your talent,
and I thought,

11:38.899 --> 11:41.533
well, the apple can't fall
far from the tree.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.535
- Different orchard, Jocelyn.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.537
Though I do admire
the confidence.

11:45.672 --> 11:46.938
- What are we gonna do now?

11:47.073 --> 11:49.741
- "We?" We are at the precise
intersection

11:49.810 --> 11:52.977
of which I tried
to steer us clear.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.080
No, Babs Streisand's vocal
coach quit the business

11:56.116 --> 11:59.951
after just two lessons
with our sweet Alexis.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.220
He now lives in a monastery.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.297

12:13.333 --> 12:14.899
- Wow, it took a while
to get the drinks,

12:15.034 --> 12:17.602
yet, I don't see any drinks.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.838
- Oh uh, we just finished them
at the bar.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.106
- Oh, I see.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.042
Well, you got back
at the perfect time.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.512
Elmdale Moto Lodge just won
"Best Motel Suite."

12:27.514 --> 12:29.781
Coincidentally,
the Hospies Committee

12:29.916 --> 12:31.849
just had their retreat there
last fall.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.685
I'm not saying something's up,
but uh...

12:34.721 --> 12:36.554
- Okay...
Emcee: Our next award...

12:36.556 --> 12:38.923
- So, what are you doing
after this?

12:38.925 --> 12:41.325
- Oh, well, I happen
to have a king suite

12:41.394 --> 12:42.994
at the Elmdale Moto Lodge

12:42.996 --> 12:45.329
in exchange for presenting
an award today, so...

12:45.365 --> 12:47.264
- Well, I did pack a bag.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.599
- Oh my.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.535
- Just thought I'd tag along
with you for a few days,

12:50.604 --> 12:53.271
you know, tour the best
and brightest

12:53.406 --> 12:55.606
in dusty roadside
accommodations.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.007
- Oh!

12:57.043 --> 12:58.877
- I will be traveling
with royalty, after all.

12:59.012 --> 13:02.514
Johnny: Getting close, Stevie.
Stay calm!

13:02.649 --> 13:04.048
- Wait, I'm sorry,
I-I'm not sure

13:04.050 --> 13:05.550
if we're still joking around.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.019
- Well, I took Monday off,

13:08.154 --> 13:10.722
and I know you have a few more
motels to hit, so...

13:10.857 --> 13:13.358
- Oh! Yeah...

13:13.493 --> 13:15.794
no, that would be fine.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.328
- That would be fine?

13:17.463 --> 13:18.896
That's the kind of reaction
you want.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.631
- No, I'm sorry, sorry,
I just, I...

13:20.667 --> 13:21.900
you just caught me
a little off guard.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.367
I just wanna make sure
that we're still

13:23.436 --> 13:26.036
on the same page here.
- Yeah, totally.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.172
- Yeah... good, good, okay.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.374
'cause you know, I thought this
was just something great

13:30.443 --> 13:32.777
that happened when it happened.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.511
- It is.
- Stevie!

13:34.548 --> 13:35.713
- (Gasps)

13:35.749 --> 13:37.381
- I mean, you know,
I'm on the road so much,

13:37.517 --> 13:38.783
and you've got the motel
to run,

13:38.918 --> 13:40.685
I don't see any of that
changing any time soon.

13:42.789 --> 13:43.988
- Okay.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.124
But what if it could change?

13:47.127 --> 13:51.296
- I'm sorry, I-I don't see that
happening for either of us.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.597
- Oh.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.366
Emcee: The winner is...

13:55.368 --> 13:57.234
Rosebud Motel.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.236
- Oh! Yessssss!

13:59.272 --> 14:01.272
Stevie, we did it!

14:01.407 --> 14:02.974
(Laughs) Oh my God!

14:04.010 --> 14:05.643
Ohhhh!

14:05.712 --> 14:07.278
(Audience applauds)

14:07.413 --> 14:09.113
Stevie!

14:09.149 --> 14:11.115
Look at her, she's stunned!

14:12.552 --> 14:14.085
(Birds chirp)

14:15.255 --> 14:16.654
(Box thumps)

14:17.991 --> 14:19.591
- Um...

14:20.961 --> 14:22.960
hey!
- Hey!

14:22.996 --> 14:24.362
You're home.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.230
I was just gonna leave you
that little note

14:26.266 --> 14:28.766
and a box of chocolates.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.968
- I got the part, didn't I?

14:31.104 --> 14:32.804
Come in, come in!

14:32.939 --> 14:34.772
(Alexis squeals,
Jocelyn laughs nervously)

14:34.841 --> 14:36.707
- Ohhh...

14:36.743 --> 14:38.242
- Yay! Nom nom!

14:38.311 --> 14:39.911
- I now see that there
are different ways

14:40.046 --> 14:42.780
to interpret chocolates.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.249
Alexis, I just wanted to say...

14:45.252 --> 14:46.951
<i> Moira: Am I hearing Jocelyn?</i>

14:47.086 --> 14:49.253
- Yeah, she's come to tell me
the good news!

14:49.256 --> 14:50.955
<i> - Oh, did she?</i>

14:51.090 --> 14:53.791
Chocolates?
Are we celebrating, Jocelyn?

14:53.927 --> 14:56.160
- The chocolates were a mistake.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.130
Alexis, after very careful
consideration,

15:00.266 --> 15:04.669
I've decided that you are
overqualified for the role.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.737
- I know, but I'm totally
fine with that.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.908
- And I really value you
as our in-house publicist.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.544
- Jocelyn, no. Oh, we can see
where this is going.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.947
- Part of me thinks that maybe
we should give the role

15:15.949 --> 15:18.316
to somebody who really
needs it.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.218
- Oh Alexis, I wanted
to fight for you,

15:20.220 --> 15:23.287
but I had to recuse myself
as your Mummy!

15:23.290 --> 15:25.055
- Okay, um...

15:25.091 --> 15:27.191
Who did you pick?

15:27.193 --> 15:29.227
- We're still looking.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.829
- So you picked no one
over me?

15:33.366 --> 15:36.200
- That would be a Jocelyn
question.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.605
- Maybe there's a better
role for you.

15:41.707 --> 15:42.940
- What's better than the lead?

15:42.976 --> 15:45.777
- Yes, I'm curious
about that as well.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.446
- Kit Kat Club Dancer
Number Six!

15:48.448 --> 15:50.447
Hah!
- Sorry?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.116
- She doesn't have a lot
of lines,

15:52.251 --> 15:54.052
but she has a very
sexy costume,

15:54.054 --> 15:55.987
and a lot of face time
on stage,

15:56.056 --> 15:58.255
which I know that you love...
- I love both of those things.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.890
Okay, um...

15:59.960 --> 16:01.792
would that require like,
another audition?

16:01.828 --> 16:03.194
- No, no!

16:03.329 --> 16:05.129
No, the part is yours.

16:06.432 --> 16:09.000
- Jocelyn, how wonderfully
generous of us.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.468
- Okay.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.803
Well, I'm guess I'll have to
put you in touch with my agent.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.440
But I think you already
have her number.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.142
And we'll get going
on negotiations!

16:18.178 --> 16:21.212
- I would have my agent
accept that offer, dear.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.546
- Yes.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.814
(Audience applauds, music plays)

16:23.883 --> 16:25.149
- Thank you.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.585
Woo! How 'bout that,
partner, huh?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.821
Not bad for a couple
of years' work.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.956
Hey trust me, I'm just
as shocked as you are.

16:32.091 --> 16:35.626
But this is ours, and no one
can take it from us.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.294
- Sorry, Sir, uh,
I'm gonna need to take that

16:37.330 --> 16:38.796
for the next category.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.631
We'll be mailing yours in six
to eight weeks,

16:40.633 --> 16:42.166
along with the bill.
Okay, great.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.434
- Yeah, okay.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.036
Well, that's probably
for the best,

16:45.171 --> 16:47.238
I mean, I don't wanna be
lugging that thing around

16:47.373 --> 16:49.240
to all the after-parties.
- Mhmm.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.875
- So, Stevie, I thought
we'd go for a...

16:51.911 --> 16:53.044
celebratory dinner, huh?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.012
- Yeah.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.514
- Unless that steps
on your plans with Emir?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.117
- Nope, there's no more
plans anymore,

16:59.252 --> 17:01.219
so, whatever you wanna do.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.622
- Your weekend plans
got pushed, or...?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.024
- Uh no, just cancelled.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.859
It was a stupid idea anyways.

17:07.994 --> 17:10.127
I don't know what
I was thinking.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.830
(Sobs quietly)

17:12.866 --> 17:15.199
- Okay, well, you know what,

17:15.235 --> 17:16.868
if it's okay with you,

17:17.003 --> 17:18.903
why don't we beat
the traffic, and just...

17:18.905 --> 17:21.572
just head home, 'cause
I gotta be honest, I'm...

17:21.574 --> 17:24.208
I'm feeling awfully tired,
actually.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.744
- Mr. Rose, I know how
important this is to you.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.714
- Oh Stevie,
we got what we came for.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.883
Well, we didn't actually
get it, they took it back.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.684
I mean, what kind
of cheap-ass award show

17:33.753 --> 17:35.019
takes back an award?!

17:35.088 --> 17:37.421
- Mr. Rose, I don't think
I can go back out there.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.490
- Well, tell you what,
you stay here,

17:39.625 --> 17:41.759
I'll grab your bag, and maybe...

17:41.761 --> 17:43.360
a few shrimp for the road?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.596
- Yeah, thanks.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.532
(Choked sob)

17:49.402 --> 17:51.202
(Sighs)

17:51.271 --> 17:53.437
Patrick: I don't regret
what I did.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.306
- Well, look who it is.

17:56.342 --> 17:59.043
- Ronnie, we want to apologize

17:59.178 --> 18:01.178
for the miscommunication
this afternoon.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.446
- We?

18:02.482 --> 18:03.915
- What's that?

18:03.917 --> 18:08.385
- This is just a, an expression
of our continued appreciation.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.255
- I don't see any of that
blue cheese in here.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.124
- David, did you put any
of the blue cheese

18:13.259 --> 18:14.459
in there for Ronnie?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.260
- That cheese was very
expensive.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.262
- We'd be happy to run
some over.

18:18.298 --> 18:22.266
So what would be the update
on the tiles, then?

18:22.401 --> 18:24.669
- Funny you should ask.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.205
I was just heading out
to run them over.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.406
- Ah!
- Hmm.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.140
- So I wonder if you still
need the basket, then.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.975
- Oh, I still need the basket.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.511
- So uh, does this mean
that the whole project

18:33.580 --> 18:35.112
could be wrapped up then,
by tonight?

18:35.181 --> 18:38.149
- Did I just say that I was
heading out right now?

18:38.151 --> 18:40.217
- Yes, she did!
- She did, great.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.886
- Uh so, should we just
jump in with you?

18:42.021 --> 18:43.754
- I don't think so.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.623
- What about just me
then, Ronnie?

18:45.692 --> 18:49.227
(Truck door opens
then slams shut)

18:49.229 --> 18:50.828
- This went well...

18:50.830 --> 18:52.263
I think.
- Yeah.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.069
(Clothes rustle)

18:59.105 --> 19:01.639
(Sniffles)

19:01.708 --> 19:03.441
(Knocking)

19:12.185 --> 19:14.719
(Groans)

19:14.721 --> 19:16.253
- Well, hello, you!

19:16.389 --> 19:18.256
- Mrs. Rose,
what are you doing here?

19:18.258 --> 19:21.525
- I thought you and I might
celebrate your big award!

19:21.594 --> 19:22.994
- Come in.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.997
- Oh, thank you.

19:28.001 --> 19:32.069
- And I was made aware
there was a loss, as well.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.138
- Yeah.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.340
Turns out, someone who's been
working the front desk

19:36.475 --> 19:39.243
of a motel her whole life
isn't exactly a turn-on.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.980
- I was speaking of his loss.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.783
Stevie, underneath the brambly
tartan blousant

19:45.785 --> 19:47.752
is a chrysalis,

19:47.754 --> 19:50.588
just bursting with potential.

19:50.657 --> 19:54.358
- (Sighs) Well, I'm glad
somebody thinks so.

19:54.493 --> 19:57.261
- Yes, perhaps she just
needs a...

19:57.297 --> 20:00.498
bit of a shock
to her daily routine.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.699
- That's kind of what I was
going for, Mrs. Rose.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.635
- Well, the kind of shock
I'm referring to, Stevie,

20:04.671 --> 20:07.104
will not come in the form
of a man.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.641
- What is this?

20:10.677 --> 20:13.010
- Oh, just a gift that once
jolted me out

20:13.046 --> 20:15.379
of my little podunk routine.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.182
- Me, in front of people?

20:18.184 --> 20:20.284
I am not an actor.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.653
- And neither is the lead
in the play.

20:22.689 --> 20:26.390
She's simply a headstrong
young woman,

20:26.392 --> 20:28.392
who's been knocked about
a few times,

20:28.527 --> 20:32.196
and... looking to make
the most of herself.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.732
- (Sighs) Did Mr. Rose
put you up to this?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.267
- No, this inspired piece
of stunt-casting

20:37.303 --> 20:39.237
was an idea all my own.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.007
And we can't find anyone else.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.410
- Thank you...
- You're welcome.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.078
I should've led with this.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.814
Please tell me you can sing.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.882
- I sing in the car.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.417
- Good enough.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.686
Okay. Peruse.

20:55.722 --> 20:56.954
At your leisure.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.223
- Okay.

20:59.225 --> 21:01.292
Oh, I see you've opened
a bottle of wine already,

21:01.427 --> 21:04.095
I won't burden you with another.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.762
Bye.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.164
- Bye.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.503
(Sniffles)

21:12.572 --> 21:14.405
(Papers rustle)

21:17.944 --> 21:19.443
(Wineglass rasps)
