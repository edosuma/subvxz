WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.935
            You made me give up
            the fbi.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.269
Please, jana.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.337
        I'm here for you
        when you need anything.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.973
You've been
so good to me.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.942
            Who are you,
            lily gray?

00:09.943 --> 00:12.011
I'm a woman who has been
waiting for this moment

00:12.013 --> 00:13.479
For a very long time.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.447
            And how is ryan?

00:15.449 --> 00:17.216
            Ryan: I'm interested
            in one thing.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.817
            I want to kill
            joe carroll.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.320
        Something tells me
        that home, sweet, home

00:21.322 --> 00:22.988
        Is very close by.

00:22.990 --> 00:25.224
I want to spend
some time with joe
without interruption.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.192
            Why are you being
            so nice to me?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.360
I like you, emma.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.796
            You left me
            all alone.

00:30.798 --> 00:31.964
Where's giselle?

00:31.966 --> 00:33.365
            Where's joe carroll?

00:38.671 --> 00:39.738
            Where is max?

00:39.740 --> 00:42.374
Dead!
I killed her.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.642
                Unh!

00:45.045 --> 00:47.146
            No!

00:47.148 --> 00:48.847
                Did you lock
                us in here?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.482
Mother doesn't want
to be disturbed.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.884
I'm sorry.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.888
Where have you been?

00:58.158 --> 01:00.359
I will not be
controlled.

01:00.361 --> 01:01.994
            I don't want to
            control you.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.629
            I wouldn't want you
            if I could.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.601
Luke: Ha ha ha!

02:15.603 --> 02:17.169
No. You're way better
in bed.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.338
I mean, you're
a way better cuddle buddy

02:19.340 --> 02:22.007
Than laura.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.610
No. I know, I know.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.012
Yeah.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.152
What's up?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.520
            When'd you get home?

02:34.522 --> 02:37.623
Uh, a little while ago.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.024
            What--what's
            going on?

02:39.026 --> 02:40.492
            Someone--someone
            in there with you?

02:40.494 --> 02:42.161
Uh, yeah. It's, um--
it's giselle.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.362
            Oh. Giselle's back.
            Awesome!

02:43.364 --> 02:45.531
Hey. Look, mark.
We're, uh,

02:45.533 --> 02:47.933
Kind of in the middle
of something, you know?

02:49.802 --> 02:51.470
            No. I don't know.
            Let me in.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.505
Ok, ok.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.474
We didn't want you
to find out this way,

02:55.476 --> 02:56.808
But, you know, there's
always been

02:56.810 --> 02:59.645
That unspoken thing
between giselle and I?

02:59.647 --> 03:01.980
Well, we've been
exploring it.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.615
            What are you
            talking about?

03:07.820 --> 03:10.622
                What?

03:10.624 --> 03:13.025
            What--what
            happened? Gis--

03:19.966 --> 03:22.034
            She--she's dead.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.737
No, no. She's just--
she's just sleeping is all.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.306
            Luke, what did you
            do to her?

03:27.308 --> 03:29.208
I didn't do anything.
She's just--

03:29.210 --> 03:32.044
        Hey, giselle.
        Wake up, wake up.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.580
    Hey. Come on. Wake up!

03:34.582 --> 03:36.014
    Hey. Wake up. Come on.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.149
        Hey. Wake up.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.350
Luke, luke,
she's dead!

03:38.352 --> 03:39.985
        Don't say that!

03:43.223 --> 03:44.623
                        She's...

03:48.027 --> 03:49.428
        She's not dead.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.937
Who did this?

04:00.907 --> 04:02.474
        Ryan hardy.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.512
    Ryan hardy killed her.

04:17.857 --> 04:19.391
            Mendez: Let me get
            this straight

04:19.392 --> 04:22.227
            For this to be
            a photograph of who
            you say it is,

04:22.229 --> 04:23.729
            Someone would have
            had to swapped all

04:23.731 --> 04:25.697
            Of the dna records
            in sentinel,

04:25.699 --> 04:27.065
            Both digital
            and hard copies,

04:27.067 --> 04:28.533
            Know the exact
            warehouse where

04:28.535 --> 04:29.768
            The physical dna
            was stored,

04:29.770 --> 04:30.769
            And replace it.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.970
Let me finish.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.572
            And replace it
            with carroll's

04:33.574 --> 04:35.374
            Illegitimate
            brother's dna.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.742
Look. The sheriff
in havenport last year

04:36.744 --> 04:38.744
Tim nelson, aka roderick,

04:38.746 --> 04:40.112
Was joe carroll's
number two guy.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.880
He infiltrated
law enforcement for years.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.482
        That was a sheriff's
        department.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.317
        We're the fbi.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.552
        There are no
        killer cult moles
        in the fbi.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.888
There several key moments
unaccounted for last year

04:49.890 --> 04:51.223
Where carroll's cult
was ahead of us.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.624
        And it had to have
        been a mole?

04:52.626 --> 04:56.061
        It had nothing to do
        with incompetence?

04:56.063 --> 04:58.263
        I'm sorry.

04:58.265 --> 05:01.633
        Listen. You're
        a consultant here,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.602
        And if this case
        is getting to be
        too much for you--

05:03.604 --> 05:06.471
No. I'm fine.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.474
            Are you sure?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.510
        I was briefed.
        I know last year
        left some scars,

05:11.512 --> 05:13.245
        Your psych eval's
        still pending.

05:13.247 --> 05:17.316
        All I'm saying is
        that you're free
        to go home.

05:17.318 --> 05:20.052
        Everyone here
        would understand.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.366
      Man: Authorities are
      continuing to search

05:34.368 --> 05:37.769
    For former soho gallery
    owner lily gray,

05:37.771 --> 05:40.205
    Who's now under suspicion
    of being involved...

05:40.207 --> 05:42.107
                [door unlocking]

05:42.109 --> 05:44.209
            Hey. Relax. It's me.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.846
            You ok?

05:47.848 --> 05:51.817
[grunting]

05:51.819 --> 05:53.285
You've been gone
a long time.

05:53.287 --> 05:56.288
            I had to drive
            a ways to find
            24-hour pharmacy.

05:56.290 --> 05:59.725
            Ok. All right.
            We have bandages,

05:59.727 --> 06:02.961
            We have peroxide,
            needle and thread.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.329
Did you bring
any vodka?

06:04.331 --> 06:08.300
            Very funny.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.168
    Law enforcement officials
    continue to ask...

06:10.170 --> 06:12.504
Giselle knew
we were here.

06:12.506 --> 06:16.541
If she told someone,
they're gonna come for us.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.410
            Gave the manager
            50 bucks to give
            us a heads-up

06:18.412 --> 06:20.245
            If he saw anyone.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.246
            I'm gonna stitch
            you up,

06:21.248 --> 06:23.515
            We get out of here.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.717
I broke into that
woman's home.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.486
I tried to remove
the evidence,

06:27.488 --> 06:30.889
But I had to make
a run for it.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.592
Local police could be
processing it now.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.762
I left blood,
I left clothes,
I left prints.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.930
        It's gonna take time
        for them to tie
        it to new york

06:38.932 --> 06:40.332
        Unless you want
        to call the fbi

06:40.334 --> 06:43.101
        And help it along, hmm?

06:47.039 --> 06:49.374
I thought you were dead.

06:49.376 --> 06:52.144
            I know,
            but I wasn't.

06:57.550 --> 07:00.051
[groans]

07:00.053 --> 07:01.520
            Ok, ok, ok.

07:05.425 --> 07:09.561
Hey. How about you
take the car and head
back to new york?

07:09.563 --> 07:10.929
            No way.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.932
            Look at you.
            You could be dead.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.401
            You still think you
            can do this alone.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.969
            I don't get it.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.284
            It's weston.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.119
Mike...

07:34.121 --> 07:36.955
It's me.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.458
        Ryan, are you all right?
        Where are you?

07:39.460 --> 07:40.759
I'm in stratford,
connecticut.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.727
I found lily
and the twins.

07:42.729 --> 07:43.929
            You called me?

07:43.931 --> 07:46.665
Yeah. Surprise.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.767
I need your help,
mike.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.469
I don't want to
screw this up.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.170
        Are you ok? Did--did
        something happen?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.905
Yeah, but there's
no time.

07:53.907 --> 07:57.008
I'm in a motel.
I'm at oak and 6th,
room 7.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.145
Call everyone in,
atf, swat, police.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.180
Lily gray doesn't
just have twins.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.849
She's got
a whole family.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.083
I don't know how many.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.352
            Ryan. Ryan.

08:07.354 --> 08:10.155
Yeah?

08:10.157 --> 08:13.091
            Is joe carroll
            with them?

08:13.093 --> 08:16.461
I'm pretty sure
he is.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.096
            I'm on my way.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.710
                Heh heh.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.447
I could stay
like this forever.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.649
                Oh.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.784
            I wouldn't object
            to that.

08:39.785 --> 08:42.854
But there's so much
to do.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.991
You know we can't
stay here.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.760
Sooner or later,
they're gonna
find this place.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.964
Do you want
a drink?

08:52.966 --> 08:54.966
            Yeah, please.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.709
            But I take it you
            have somewhere
            in mind, huh?

09:04.711 --> 09:08.680
Of course I have
a plan, joe.

09:08.682 --> 09:13.985
I knew once I was
exposed to the world
everything would change,

09:13.987 --> 09:15.654
So I've made provisions.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.688
            Oh?

09:16.690 --> 09:20.058
Heh heh heh.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.860
I have a plane.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.028
            Hmm.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.897
It's at an airstrip
near here.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.432
We could fly
to boston tonight

09:27.434 --> 09:30.769
And take a private jet
to venezuela.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.571
I own an estate there.

09:32.573 --> 09:35.073
It's on the coast.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.375
It's lovely.

09:37.377 --> 09:41.012
            Phew. Heh heh.

09:41.014 --> 09:44.182
            Yeah.
            That sounds, uh...

09:44.184 --> 09:46.551
            That sounds
            very nice,

09:46.553 --> 09:49.220
            But, um...

09:49.222 --> 09:51.923
            Why venezuela?

09:51.925 --> 09:55.226
Well, there's no
extradition, for one.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.696
That adds
a certain safety.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.769
We could get
new identities.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.572
You'd write,
and I'd paint.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.474
You'd publish
under a pseudonym.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.643
It would be just you
and me and the kids,

10:11.645 --> 10:14.479
And emma and mandy
would join us, too.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.648
We'd be a family.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.854
            That's a great deal
            to consider.

10:27.593 --> 10:30.662
What's to consider?

10:30.664 --> 10:33.832
It's perfect.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.568
What other options
do you have?

10:36.570 --> 10:38.770
            Oh.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.672
            There's always
            options, lily.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.308
        [knock on door]

10:43.310 --> 10:44.509
Go away.

10:44.511 --> 10:45.577
        [louder knocking]

10:45.579 --> 10:48.246
What?!

10:48.248 --> 10:50.315
[speaking russian]

11:17.443 --> 11:19.911
Lily: Where are you?

11:43.536 --> 11:44.836
    What happened to her?

11:44.838 --> 11:46.037
Luke: Ryan hardy
killed her,

11:46.039 --> 11:49.007
Killed jamel, too.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.975
    Why didn't you tell me
        about ryan?

11:50.977 --> 11:52.210
        How could you hide
        this from me?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.411
He surprised me!

11:53.413 --> 11:55.080
I was--I was
in the moment!

11:55.082 --> 11:57.682
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna kill him, mom!

11:57.684 --> 11:59.884
I'm gonna kill him!
He's not gonna get
away with it.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.753
He's--he's not gonna--
he's not gonna get
away with it.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.421
He's not gonna get
away with it.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.856
He's not gonna--he's not
gonna get away with it!

12:04.858 --> 12:08.026
            Luke, stop it!

12:08.028 --> 12:10.228
            Look at me.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.097
            We have to keep
            ourselves together.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.198
Ryan has to pay
for what he did.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.034
            Oh...

12:16.036 --> 12:18.503
                        He will,

12:18.505 --> 12:21.339
        But if ryan's near,
        we are all in danger,

12:21.341 --> 12:23.241
        And we have to leave.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.944
He's--he's
with his niece.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.779
No one else.
Giselle told me.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.547
They're staying at some
motel in stratford.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.050
I shot him. He's hurt.
Let me go finish
him off, mom.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.585
                        Shut up!

12:41.527 --> 12:43.962
    Go tell everyone
    we have to leave
    a soon as possible,

12:43.964 --> 12:46.965
               But don't mention
       ryan hardy to joe or emma

12:46.967 --> 12:49.868
    Or that other--
    whatever the hell
    her name is--mandy.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.303
You're worried
about joe finding out.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.372
Giselle is dead, mom.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.576
        And as far as I
        understand it,

12:58.578 --> 13:01.880
        That is entirely
        your fault.

13:01.882 --> 13:05.250
    Now is not the time
    to test me, luke.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.818
        We're leaving
        in the morning.

13:18.597 --> 13:19.731
            How do you feel?

13:19.733 --> 13:21.833
Great, doc.
Good as new.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.168
            So where's
            the cavalry?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.969
Something's wrong.
It should take the fbi

13:24.971 --> 13:26.805
15 minutes to get here
by helicopter.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.473
        [knock on door]

13:34.246 --> 13:35.613
            Did you drive?

13:35.615 --> 13:37.015
Can I come in?

13:37.017 --> 13:39.818
            Yeah. Sorry.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.952
        Hello, again.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.020
Hmm.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.188
        You two know
        each other?

13:43.190 --> 13:46.124
Max: We met.
Briefly.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.293
    So where is everybody?
    We need manpower.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.828
            There isn't
            anybody else.
            It's just me.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.496
What do you mean
it's just you?

13:51.498 --> 13:54.833
We need roadblocks,
aerial searches.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.202
            I think
            the fbi might
            be compromised.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.885
Have you seen joe?
Is he up yet.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.488
In english, please.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.756
            Bonjour, emma.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.726
    Have you seen joe?

14:21.728 --> 14:22.894
He's in lily's room,

14:22.896 --> 14:24.996
Where he's been
all night.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.464
They had sex.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.334
    What?

14:29.336 --> 14:30.802
            It was
            pretty intense.

14:30.804 --> 14:31.970
            The doors around
            here are thick,

14:31.972 --> 14:34.405
            And I still
            heard it.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.674
            What's wrong?

14:36.676 --> 14:38.243
Nothing.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.913
    Really? Because you
    look like just
    sucked a lemon.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.548
            Why is everyone
            packing?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.617
I don't know.
Why don't you ask?

14:51.557 --> 14:52.824
        That's joe.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.259
            No. That is joe.
            The girl is

14:54.261 --> 14:56.828
            The daughter of one
            his prison pen pals.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.963
            Ryan, I'm sorry I
            didn't believe you.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.736
    So joe has someone
    on the inside.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.171
            He had to.
            He was tipped off
            at every turn.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.674
    You know, roderick
    went to the academy
    in virginia.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.075
    Maybe he crossed paths
    with a cadet that

15:11.077 --> 15:12.577
    Went on to the bureau.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.878
And the militia boys
in havenport,

15:13.880 --> 15:15.513
They had several ties
to the fbi.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.948
            Now I want
            to pursue this,
            but the minute

15:16.950 --> 15:18.783
            I open
            an investigation
            they're gonna know.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.118
    No. You don't want
    to tip them off.
    You're right not to.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.586
            You said lily
            and the twins
            were here.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.087
            They're somewhere
            in stratford.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.589
    Yeah, but we don't have
    an exact location.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.090
    We're pretty sure
    they know we're here,

15:26.092 --> 15:28.226
    And I think they're pissed
        because I killed

15:28.228 --> 15:29.694
      Two of their family.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.629
                They'll show up.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.730
            That's your plan?

15:32.732 --> 15:33.898
    Pretty much.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.066
            We need
            a better plan.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.601
                Look. We're
        sitting ducks here.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.636
        We need to be smart
                about this.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.438
    Come on. Let's go.

15:45.577 --> 15:46.711
            Oh, now you're
            the gentleman?

15:46.713 --> 15:47.912
Sorry about
the other day.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.147
                        Save it.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.403
Excuse me, sir.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.838
Mike: Hey, punk.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.046
What?

16:26.618 --> 16:28.019
Carroll: Emma?

16:31.757 --> 16:34.993
        There you are.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.596
        Look. I'm sorry,
        but we, uh,
        we need to talk.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.632
It's quite urgent.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.434
Lily's leaving.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.669
            I noticed.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.804
Yeah. She wants us
to go with her

16:46.806 --> 16:49.640
        To venezuela.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.209
You're kidding.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.543
        She's got it
        all worked out.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.978
She's got a big house
on the ocean,

16:53.980 --> 16:55.947
She's offering us money
and protection,

16:55.949 --> 16:58.516
And venezuela's got
very strong extradition laws.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.084
    Sounds awesome.

17:02.788 --> 17:07.358
Yeah. Yeah.
Guess it does.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.462
And she wants, uh--
she thinks I should
write a new novel.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.300
            Have you read it?

17:16.301 --> 17:18.803
What, this? Yeah.

17:18.805 --> 17:22.406
    It's fabricated myth,
        half facts.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.242
        It's, uh, it's wretched.

17:25.244 --> 17:27.645
In other words,
the truth.

17:32.351 --> 17:36.888
            Yeah. Yeah.
            I suppose it is.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.324
            Still horribly
            written, though.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.492
            And yet...

17:41.494 --> 17:44.595
            [sighs]

17:44.597 --> 17:50.034
            It's still better
            than anything
            I could write.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.836
            I'm no writer. I...

17:53.772 --> 17:56.607
            Never was.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.377
            No. It's high time
            that I--I stop
            pretending

17:59.379 --> 18:03.915
            That I'm something
            I'm not,

18:03.917 --> 18:06.150
            And I can't go
            to venezuela.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.822
        I'll only disappoint
        a new group of people.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.695
So what are you
going to do?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.733
        Well, I suspect

18:22.735 --> 18:27.238
I don't have much time
left on this earth,

18:27.240 --> 18:30.541
But whatever time
I do have,

18:30.543 --> 18:33.311
I know I want it to be
better than this.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.285
            So you have a plan?

18:41.287 --> 18:43.888
Yeah.

18:43.890 --> 18:47.859
Yes, I do.
I have an epic plan.

18:49.761 --> 18:53.464
Will it work?
I don't know. Heh.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.999
I can't promise you
anything...

18:58.670 --> 19:03.441
But I can promise you
my loyalty.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.511
I'll never take you
for granted again.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.481
I need you, em.

19:12.918 --> 19:17.722
Please will you
come with me?

19:20.792 --> 19:23.194
            I'm tired
            of running, joe.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.595
    Oh.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.648
I told the manager
we were taking him
back to new york.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.049
            He'd prefer
            we keep his fine
            establishment

19:45.051 --> 19:46.184
            Out of it.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.652
            That's his car
            over there.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.953
            Looks like
            he came alone.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.154
            Can you run
            his plates?

19:50.156 --> 19:51.355
    Mike: Yeah.
    Luke: They're fake.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.524
            You won't find
            anything.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.359
        Wow.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.695
        Your lips are perfect,
                you know that?

19:57.697 --> 20:01.065
        I found this
        on him.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.867
            Max: So...

20:02.869 --> 20:04.468
        Any chance you're
        gonna tell us

20:04.470 --> 20:06.904
        Where that crazy.
        Mother of yours is?

20:06.906 --> 20:10.141
She's with joe.

20:10.143 --> 20:11.709
Now doesn't that
make you squirm

20:11.711 --> 20:14.812
Knowing you're
so close but not?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.750
You know what makes
me squirm?

20:19.752 --> 20:20.985
The thought
of killing you

20:20.987 --> 20:22.753
And then doing
things to you.

20:26.091 --> 20:29.160
        [luke laughing]

20:29.162 --> 20:30.661
        One more, please.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.530
    You got it.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.698
Mike! Mike, mike.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.999
            Really?

20:43.542 --> 20:44.675
Ryan: Hey. You ok?

20:44.677 --> 20:46.277
            Yeah, I'm fine.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.079
You sure you're
up for this?

20:48.081 --> 20:49.614
We got to keep
