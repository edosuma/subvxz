WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:04.221
[instrumental music]

00:06.441 --> 00:07.833
[Jane]
Hey, it could do
with a little, uh

00:07.920 --> 00:10.445
yard maintenance,
don't you think?

00:10.532 --> 00:13.013
How does one person
live in a house this big?

00:13.100 --> 00:15.406
Uh, let me see.
By being very rich.

00:15.493 --> 00:16.712
That's not what I meant.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.018
Ah, you mean morally.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.541
Well, we've been called in

00:19.628 --> 00:22.283
so it's likely
that whoever lived here

00:22.370 --> 00:24.154
paid a hefty price
in the end.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.373
[Lisbon sighs]

00:28.506 --> 00:30.160
There is something off here.

00:30.247 --> 00:33.250
This place
gives me the creeps.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.687
[Jane]
Normally, I'd be tempted
to mock your superstition

00:35.774 --> 00:38.777
but in this case,
I'm inclined to agree.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.040
Ladies first.

00:49.397 --> 00:52.356
Boss, this is Reggie Brooks,
private security.

00:52.443 --> 00:54.184
Found the body,
called it in.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.273
Hi. I'm Agent Lisbon
with the CBI.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.927
This is Patrick Jane.

00:58.014 --> 01:01.104
- Hi. How you doing?
- Is this gonna take long?

01:01.191 --> 01:02.801
I'd really like
to get out of here.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.673
Oh, why don't you just
walk us through

01:04.760 --> 01:06.588
what happened this morning?

01:06.675 --> 01:09.156
Well, I was, uh, doing
my rounds of the neighborhood

01:09.243 --> 01:10.940
this morning, as always..

01:11.027 --> 01:12.855
...when I got a call
that said, uh

01:12.942 --> 01:14.857
'Ms. Vogelsong's doctor
wasn't getting an answer'

01:14.944 --> 01:17.294
when he tried to call her
and asked me to follow up.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.514
Uh, do you know
the name of the doctor?

01:19.601 --> 01:20.558
No, I don't.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.647
Uh, you can call dispatch.

01:22.734 --> 01:27.783
Okay. So the doctor told you
to go and check on her.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.133
[Brooks]
I, uh, I noticed
the smell right away.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.700
[flames crackling]

01:31.787 --> 01:35.965
and I, uh, followed it
to the library and..

01:36.052 --> 01:37.793
...that's when
I called it in.

01:40.361 --> 01:43.103
[male #1]
'The final remains
of Elise Vogelsong'

01:43.190 --> 01:45.844
Sacramento's tragic heiress.
You know the story, right?

01:45.931 --> 01:48.586
'You know, orphan at 12,
widow at 18.'

01:48.673 --> 01:50.545
Divorced five times
before she turned 40.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.721
My mother ate that
stuff up when I was a kid.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.244
Never heard of her.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.116
Check out this place.
What a creep show.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.987
And, uh, look at this body.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.554
[male #1]
'I mean, it's reduced
entirely to ash.'

01:59.641 --> 02:01.121
'You know, there have been
a handful of cases'

02:01.208 --> 02:02.644
'I've read about.
I've never actually seen it.'

02:02.731 --> 02:04.950
Spontaneous combustion,
they like to call it.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.430
It's in a book somewhere.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.345
"Bleak House." Dickens.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.347
Yeah, Mr. Krook,
the rag and bone man

02:10.434 --> 02:12.523
burst into flames
in his parlor.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.221
- It's not believable.
- I didn't buy it, either.

02:14.308 --> 02:17.267
Oh, um, it's...it's a misnomer.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.835
You know, it's not actually
spontaneous combustion at all.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.141
Uh, it almost always happens

02:21.228 --> 02:22.751
with a heavy drinker
and a smoker.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.796
They pass out
with a cigarette in their hand

02:24.883 --> 02:26.711
'ember falls onto clothing,
starts to burn'

02:26.798 --> 02:28.800
'and smoldering cloth
acts like a wick'

02:28.887 --> 02:31.890
'and it turns the victim
into a human candle..'

02:31.977 --> 02:33.849
'...with the body's
subcutaneous fat deposits'

02:33.936 --> 02:36.112
'as a perfect form of tallow.'

02:36.199 --> 02:38.070
A human candle?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.811
Ain't that awful?

02:39.898 --> 02:41.944
Yeah, what's produced is
a slow and all-consuming burn

02:42.031 --> 02:44.773
so in the end,
there's nothing left but ash.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.557
[Cho]
'So this could be
an accidental death?'

02:46.644 --> 02:48.559
[male #1]
'Yeah. Very likely.'

02:48.646 --> 02:50.257
Uh, you notice
how weird the light is?

02:50.344 --> 02:52.041
Kind of waxy and brown?

02:52.128 --> 02:54.130
That's because
human fat is congealed

02:54.217 --> 02:55.697
on all the light bulbs.
I mean--

02:55.784 --> 02:59.483
Alright. Don't say
another word...please, okay?

02:59.570 --> 03:01.877
Uh, this was murder,
which is ironic

03:01.964 --> 03:04.488
considering
Ms. Vogelsong's appreciation

03:04.575 --> 03:06.273
and love of
murder mysteries.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.752
- Murder?
- Yes.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.538
There's globules of glass
in the fireplace

03:10.625 --> 03:13.497
and, uh, this Scotch
was opened very recently.

03:13.584 --> 03:14.933
And that's a lot
of Scotch for one woman.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.849
There were at some point
four glasses right here

03:17.936 --> 03:19.199
'but now there are
only three in the room.'

03:19.286 --> 03:20.591
Where's the fourth glass?

03:20.678 --> 03:22.027
So two people are sitting down

03:22.114 --> 03:24.508
relaxing, having a drink
now one of them is dead.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.902
The other one tried
to conceal his or her presence

03:26.989 --> 03:30.340
by throwing the fourth glass
into the fireplace. Murder.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.299
Oh, you think?
Who's the other person, huh?

03:32.386 --> 03:33.691
Why'd they kill her?

03:33.778 --> 03:35.389
Well, you know,
if you hadn't mentioned

03:35.476 --> 03:38.609
the congealed human fat
in the light bulbs

03:38.696 --> 03:40.132
I may have had
the stomach to stick around

03:40.220 --> 03:42.309
and find out but I-I..

03:42.396 --> 03:43.527
You're a ghoul.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.363
[theme music]

04:01.458 --> 04:03.852
[telephone ringing]

04:06.985 --> 04:08.813
Oh, thanks.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.469
Hmm.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.387
You know, my mom kept
a scrapbook on Elise Vogelsong.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.695
You'd have thought
she was family

04:20.782 --> 04:22.784
the way she talked about her.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.831
Your mom like that?

04:26.918 --> 04:28.006
Nope.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.269
I think for mom,
it was a way

04:29.356 --> 04:30.313
of feeling better about things

04:30.400 --> 04:32.054
with my dad, you know?

04:32.141 --> 04:34.752
No matter how bad
things got between them

04:34.839 --> 04:38.452
it was always worse
for Elise Vogelsong.

04:38.539 --> 04:39.801
I think that was it, anyway.

04:39.888 --> 04:40.845
Have we got a name yet

04:40.932 --> 04:42.456
for the doctor who called?

04:42.543 --> 04:44.371
[sighs]
Dispatcher didn't
write it down.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.329
He doesn't even know
if he got it or not.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.766
Now this says someone poured
accelerant on Ms. Vogelsong

04:48.853 --> 04:50.246
and lit a match, right?

04:50.333 --> 04:51.682
Best arson teams
in the world

04:51.769 --> 04:53.510
would have missed it
99 times out of 100.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.860
And if Jane hadn't been so sure,
I'd have missed it, too.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.515
Spectrometer says traces
of ethyl alcohol and methanol.

04:58.602 --> 04:59.995
I'm guessing sterno
as an accelerant.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.389
- Wouldn't take much.
- That's nice work.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.261
Yeah, next of kin didn't
seem to believe it, though.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.525
Give it time. Lisbon
and Jane will convince 'em.

05:08.612 --> 05:11.702
Can you think of anybody who may
have wanted to harm your aunt?

05:13.487 --> 05:16.011
She was an old lady
who devoted herself to charity

05:16.098 --> 05:18.318
and helping veterans.
Who'd want to hurt her?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.363
She was losing
her mind at the end.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.757
Have you taken
that into account?

05:22.844 --> 05:24.672
Losing her mind how?

05:26.935 --> 05:30.068
Alright, you know what
my aunt endured in her life?

05:30.155 --> 05:33.724
- The scandals, the tragedies?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.813
Well, she was
a strong woman, despite it all

05:35.900 --> 05:37.249
until about two years ago.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.860
What happened?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.992
She stopped wanting
to leave the house

05:41.079 --> 05:42.559
started getting paranoid.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.082
Thought people were
out to get her.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.910
- Were they?
- No.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.304
Not at all.
It was all in her head.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.914
She fired all her servants

05:50.001 --> 05:52.569
and was living in
that big old pile by herself.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.136
Look, the police said

05:54.223 --> 05:55.964
that there was nothing
stolen from the house.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.313
There were no signs of robbery.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.836
Someone commits a murder
in a house like that

05:58.923 --> 06:01.230
and doesn't take anything?
No money, no jewels.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.406
No expensive works of art?

06:03.493 --> 06:05.234
It doesn't make
any sense, does it?

06:05.321 --> 06:07.105
Well, not yet.

06:07.192 --> 06:10.631
- It's an ongoing investigation.
- Yeah, it's on-going.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.981
Uh, could you provide us
with your aunt's doctor's name?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.417
The one who called
the security guard?

06:14.504 --> 06:16.550
No, I didn't know
her doctor. I'm sorry.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.204
As I said, my aunt had become
withdrawn in recent years.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.597
I didn't communicate
with her much.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.469
- You had a falling out?
- No.

06:22.556 --> 06:25.341
As her mind went,
she became difficult.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.343
I admit I distanced myself.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.171
I preferred to
remember her as she was.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.434
Okay. So before that,
you-you were close?

06:31.521 --> 06:33.436
Well, some of my fondest
memories from childhood

06:33.523 --> 06:36.047
were sailing with
my Aunt Elise on theSongbird.

06:36.134 --> 06:39.311
Ah. Your aunt
liked sailboats?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.661
Well, aside from the family's

06:40.748 --> 06:42.445
charitable foundations
it was her greatest joy.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.751
I don't think a week went by

06:43.838 --> 06:44.926
that she wasn't
out on the water.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.623
Even at her age?
Was that safe?

06:46.710 --> 06:48.756
There was a girl
that went with her

06:48.843 --> 06:50.497
down at the marina.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.161
Cayce Robbins?

07:06.556 --> 07:07.688
That's right.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.561
I'm Agent Lisbon
with the CBI.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.650
This is my associate,
Patrick Jane.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.260
We spoke on the phone.

07:15.347 --> 07:18.133
Oh, about Elise.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.787
You going somewhere?

07:19.874 --> 07:22.267
Yeah, Elise always said
she wanted her ashes

07:22.354 --> 07:24.531
scattered out at sea,
out of sight of land.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.098
So I figured it's my duty
to make that happen.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.448
I'm just waiting
to get the ashes.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.927
That's gonna have to wait

07:30.014 --> 07:31.886
until after our
investigation. I'm sorry.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.931
It's awful to think
what happened to her.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.107
Can you think of anybody
who may have wanted to kill her?

07:36.194 --> 07:39.459
Uh, I-I can't
but I only sailed with her.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.330
I don't know much
about her life on land.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.027
What about her mental state?

07:43.114 --> 07:45.682
In the last few years,
you see any signs of senility?

07:45.769 --> 07:50.208
Elise? No, she was sharper
than most people my age.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.254
I didn't like all the pills
she was taking, though.

07:52.341 --> 07:55.126
Doctors prescribe too
many pills these days, I think.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.563
What were the pills
she was taking?

07:56.650 --> 07:58.086
Or-or better still

07:58.173 --> 07:59.174
you know the name of the doctor

07:59.261 --> 08:00.741
that prescribed them?

08:00.828 --> 08:03.570
You know, there's some
in the cabin. I can go get 'em.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.049
Thank you. Very helpful.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.275
Seems like a civilized way
to travel, don't you think?

08:13.362 --> 08:14.929
Are you kidding?

08:15.016 --> 08:16.539
Stuck on that thing
in the middle of the ocean?

08:16.626 --> 08:18.889
It's like being in a prison cell
with a chance of drowning.

08:29.247 --> 08:30.988
There you go.
Hope that helps.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.860
[Lisbon]
'"Dr. Reinhardt."'

08:32.947 --> 08:34.644
- 'Yeah, thank you.'
- It does. Thank you.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.480
[phone beeping]

08:44.567 --> 08:46.482
Right this way,
Agent Lisbon.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.182
Come on.

08:51.269 --> 08:54.751
Uh, I was just about to learn
how to drive her wild.

08:54.838 --> 08:57.449
Five easy steps.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.408
I've been Elise Vogelsong's
personal physician

08:59.495 --> 09:02.672
for almost two years.
I felt a particular concern.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.718
She was in
the early stages of dementia.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.720
Why would you say that?

09:06.807 --> 09:08.635
Anyone who spent any time
with Elise Vogelsong

09:08.722 --> 09:11.333
would recognize the symptoms.
As a doctor, it was obvious.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.944
What kind of symptoms?

09:14.031 --> 09:16.991
Well, the onset of dementia
can manifest in various ways.

09:17.078 --> 09:20.168
In her case, it took the form
of an intense persecution mania.

09:20.255 --> 09:23.301
I was not comfortable
with her living alone but..

09:23.388 --> 09:26.043
...Elise Vogelsong
was a very..

09:26.130 --> 09:28.219
...strong-willed woman.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.570
Is that why you were so quick
to send the security company

09:30.657 --> 09:32.223
to go and check on her?

09:32.310 --> 09:34.095
Well, I'd spoken
to Elise the evening before

09:34.182 --> 09:35.879
so when I couldn't get
a reply the next morning

09:35.966 --> 09:37.577
I became concerned.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.753
I worried she'd fallen
and hurt herself.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.365
The...idea that she'd
been brutally murdered..

09:43.452 --> 09:45.193
It's beyond
all comprehension.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.716
Well, better than the discovery

09:46.803 --> 09:50.459
that her death
was related to your care.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.896
That must have been a relief.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.506
Excuse me?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.726
Well, your primary emotion
as you talk right now

09:56.813 --> 09:59.860
about Elise Vogelsong
is that of relief.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.297
Why is that?

10:02.384 --> 10:06.083
Where do you...get this idea?

10:06.170 --> 10:07.781
Is this an effective method

10:07.868 --> 10:09.478
of investigation,
making things up?

10:09.565 --> 10:11.828
Or do you
consider evidence as well?

10:14.744 --> 10:16.180
Somebody told us
they thought you were

10:16.267 --> 10:18.618
prescribing Elise
way too many drugs.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.450
Hmm.

10:25.537 --> 10:29.193
This...is a mild sleep aid.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.327
I was attempting to regulate
Elise Vogelsong's sleep cycles.

10:32.414 --> 10:35.286
Balanced sleep cycles
are a bulwark against dementia.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.940
This is widely known.

10:37.027 --> 10:39.813
Now I understand you must
pursue all avenues of inquiry

10:39.900 --> 10:43.686
but embracing the medical
theories of laypersons..

10:43.773 --> 10:45.209
...does not seem productive.

10:45.296 --> 10:48.604
Did you approve
of Elise Vogelsong sailing?

10:48.691 --> 10:50.127
I did not.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.260
Not at her age
and her condition.

10:52.347 --> 10:56.351
But as I said,
she was a willful woman.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.570
You didn't think it was good
for her to get out of the house?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.921
Of course I did
but not by going out to sea

11:01.008 --> 11:03.837
or spending time with
mentally unstable war veterans.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.534
That was her charity work?

11:05.621 --> 11:08.493
Um, the Vogelsong
Soldiers' Home.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.234
I told her
it was dangerous but..

11:13.498 --> 11:16.588
Curtis and Alex Wiley.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.199
[Rigsby]
'Both artists.'

11:18.286 --> 11:21.028
'They own the California
Impressionist Gallery.'

11:21.115 --> 11:22.725
Successful?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.379
More enthusiastic than talented
from what I could gather.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.076
They're well-liked
in the community.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.818
So family money
keeps the business running?

11:28.905 --> 11:30.254
Any trouble
with the police?

11:30.341 --> 11:31.778
None.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.388
That's Cayce Robbins, 28.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.172
[Cho]
Originally from
New London, Connecticut.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.609
Been working on or around
boats at the Bodega Bay Marina

11:37.697 --> 11:38.915
for...the last six years.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.308
And the only thing in her file

11:40.395 --> 11:42.223
is some unpaid parking tickets.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.529
- What about the doctor?
- Dr. Lance Reinhardt.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.880
Born in DC, educated
in the US and Europe.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.533
Impressive list
of honorary degrees

11:48.620 --> 11:50.361
from prestigious universities
across the globe.

11:50.448 --> 11:51.928
Moved to California
about five years ago.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.538
Clean record in the state.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.323
See what else you
can find out about Reinhardt.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.412
See what he was doing
before he moved to California

11:57.499 --> 11:58.587
and keep me posted.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.980
I'm gonna go talk to the guy

12:00.067 --> 12:01.938
who runs the
Vogelsong Soldiers' Home.

12:05.463 --> 12:08.466
Elise Vogelsong was
a wonderful, wonderful woman.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.816
We've been praying for her

12:09.903 --> 12:10.947
and for whoever it was

12:11.034 --> 12:13.384
that committed the horrible act.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.778
This place looks like
it has an interesting history.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.302
The Vogelsong fortune was made
by Elise's grandfather Ernst

12:18.389 --> 12:20.435
during the world wars.
Munitions.

12:20.522 --> 12:23.351
This foundation was created
to ease his conscience?

12:23.438 --> 12:24.744
Yes.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.702
And God bless him if it did.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.965
Elise says it gave
a purpose to her life

12:29.052 --> 12:31.098
a purpose that was missing
for many of her relations.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.316
Please, follow me.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.674
[Lisbon]
Chaplain griffin,
do you know anybody

12:42.762 --> 12:44.328
who may have
wanted to do her harm

12:44.415 --> 12:45.590
or had a grudge
against her?

12:45.677 --> 12:48.071
Here? No. As I say,
she was a lifesaver.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.117
Last year, the-the heating unit
in the building went kaput

12:50.204 --> 12:52.554
she replaced the entire thing,
no questions asked.

12:52.641 --> 12:55.078
How was Elise Vogelsong's
relationship with the veterans?

12:55.165 --> 12:57.733
Oh, she was generous with
her time as well as her money.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.040
With a certain reserve,
of course.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.998
But I did notice
a bond forming between her

13:02.085 --> 13:03.478
and one of the WACs.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.306
- Really? Which one?
- Uh, Lissie Calhoun.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.524
She was a nurse in Vietnam.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.135
Do you think we can talk to her?

13:08.222 --> 13:10.180
Uh, yeah. I mean, she's
usually here in the afternoons.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.834
I-I could tell her
to contact you.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.923
- Uh, we'd appreciate that.
- Of course.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.446
I don't know what we'll
do now that Elise is gone.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.535
I mean, there's
no one to protect us.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.320
To protect you from what?

13:19.407 --> 13:20.800
The rest of the family.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.281
"The Vogelsong fortune
breeds great entitlement

13:24.368 --> 13:25.979
and great guilt"
Elise used to tell me.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.328
And according
to her it had driven

13:27.415 --> 13:28.895
all of her
relations completely mad.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.592
All they did was fight
with each other over the money.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.811
Well, where does
the money come from

13:31.898 --> 13:33.334
that funds
the soldiers' home?

13:33.421 --> 13:35.466
The Vogelsong foundation
which Elise was in charge of.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.817
I mean, with her gone, I just,
I fear we might be shut down.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.079
Is that a real danger?

13:39.166 --> 13:41.211
Oh, yes. Sadly, yes.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.648
One of the relatives was
determined to destroy us

13:43.735 --> 13:44.867
and all of our work here.

13:44.954 --> 13:45.912
According to Elise

13:45.999 --> 13:47.522
it was an obsession of his

13:47.609 --> 13:49.829
to crush her and take
everything that was hers.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.308
Do you know
which relative?

13:51.395 --> 13:53.571
It was a nephew.
His name is Curtis Wiley.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.715
Vogelsong legal disputes.

14:06.802 --> 14:07.890
[Cho]
'Wanna help?'

14:10.893 --> 14:12.025
- Rigsby.
- What?

14:13.809 --> 14:15.463
Somebody die?

14:15.550 --> 14:19.206
No. It's from Van Pelt.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.425
[Rigsby]
She's learning
cross drive analysis

14:21.512 --> 14:23.079
and anomaly detection.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.474
And that makes you sad.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.563
I'm not sad.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.043
Yeah, okay, I'm sad.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.783
Every time she's been
away in the past

14:31.871 --> 14:34.221
and she's sent a postcard,
she always addressed it to me

14:34.308 --> 14:36.745
well, you know,
Wayne and the gang.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.573
This is just addressed
to "the bullpen"

14:38.660 --> 14:39.748
like I'm nobody.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.489
Right. She's moved on.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.231
Yes, thank you.
I know that.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.233
Like years ago.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.104
Well, years makes it
sound like decades.

14:48.191 --> 14:52.892
- It hasn't been that long.
- You're losing your mind.

14:52.979 --> 14:53.893
How long has it been
since you've had

14:53.980 --> 14:55.677
relations with a woman?

14:55.764 --> 14:56.896
[sighs]

14:58.332 --> 14:59.899
- Recently.
- Lying again.

14:59.986 --> 15:00.987
Find a woman.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.471
Yeah, you know what?
You're right.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.430
I will.
It's what I have to do.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.127
"Bullpen."

15:11.214 --> 15:13.521
Not even an "x-o"
at the end.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.263
[Rigsby]
Move on, Wayne.
Move on.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.628
Hey, Cho,
what do you got?

15:33.715 --> 15:36.326
There's about 30 descendants
of Ernst Vogelsong

15:36.413 --> 15:37.806
and every one of them
seems to be contesting

15:37.893 --> 15:38.850
a part of the will

15:38.938 --> 15:40.156
or accusing the others of some

15:40.243 --> 15:41.723
improper financial behavior.

15:41.810 --> 15:42.985
Uh, did you find out
what was going on

15:43.072 --> 15:44.552
between Elise Vogelsong
and her nephew?

15:44.639 --> 15:46.249
It was about a codicil
giving Curtis Wiley

15:46.336 --> 15:47.642
another chunk of inheritance

15:47.729 --> 15:49.470
'and a seat
on the foundation board.'

15:49.557 --> 15:51.602
There's pages of claims
and counter claims

15:51.689 --> 15:54.214
centered on whether
it took effect at 35 or 40.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.042
Seriously?

15:56.129 --> 15:57.957
These people
are a law firm's dream.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.567
No kidding.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.525
And more recently,
Curtis had been making claims

16:01.612 --> 16:03.092
of managerial incompetence.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.094
Said that there were
accounting irregularities

16:05.181 --> 16:06.748
at the foundation
and the soldiers' home.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.184
Any idea of
the status of the case

16:08.271 --> 16:09.838
which way it was leaning?

16:09.925 --> 16:12.580
No, but I've got a call out
to the probate judge.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.929
And one thing's clear,
this much paper

16:14.016 --> 16:15.365
means bad feelings
on both sides.

16:15.452 --> 16:18.020
Mm.

16:18.107 --> 16:19.630
[Wiley]
'This is a family matter.'

16:19.717 --> 16:22.024
'It's not something that
outsiders can understand.'

16:22.111 --> 16:24.418
I understand
that you lied to us earlier.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.159
You and your aunt
hated each other.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.074
- And you're greedy.
- No, you're wrong!

16:31.251 --> 16:32.426
[breathing heavily]

16:32.513 --> 16:34.297
That's not true.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.560
I never felt any ill will
towards my aunt.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.432
I loved her.
I wanted to help her.

16:38.519 --> 16:42.131
By suing her? Interesting way
of showing your love.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.872
Alright, look,
from a financial point of view

16:43.959 --> 16:45.700
'something had to be done.'

16:45.787 --> 16:47.963
My aunt was not making good
decisions. Her mind was going.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.226
Well, so you say,
and Dr. Reinhardt

16:50.313 --> 16:52.533
but Elise's sailing
companion didn't say so.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.404
Excuse me
if I don't put much trust

16:54.491 --> 16:56.406
in what Cayce Robbins says.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.582
A reading of my aunt's will
showed that little thief

16:58.669 --> 17:01.237
manipulated my aunt
into giving her the Songbird.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.500
Why shouldn't your aunt
give Cayce the boat

17:03.587 --> 17:04.806
if that's what she wanted?

17:04.893 --> 17:06.286
Because that boat is worth

17:06.373 --> 17:08.114
a quarter of a million dollars.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.638
Look, all assets
of any unmarried heirs

17:10.725 --> 17:12.161
revert back
to the family trust.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.250
That's how it's done,
as my aunt well knew.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.035
Apparently, that's not
what she wanted.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.471
Well, she was not
in her right mind

17:17.558 --> 17:19.386
and people were taking
advantage of that.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.214
The expenditures
of the soldiers' home

17:21.301 --> 17:23.303
were astronomical.
One of the trustees told me.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.566
And now we're losing
the Songbird?

17:25.653 --> 17:28.308
Honey, this couple's interested
in one of your paintings.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.310
Do you think you could
come over and talk to them?

17:36.098 --> 17:38.361
My family's
being robbed blind.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.711
It's my fiduciary
responsibility to act.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.020
$250,000 is a lot of money.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.891
We should go talk
to Cayce Robbins again.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.329
I'm always happy
to take a trip to the ocean.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.986
[Jane]
Well, we could
get on board and wait.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.206
[Lisbon]
Not without a warrant,
we're not.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.861
[Jane]
Ugh. Rules are just so..

17:59.948 --> 18:01.950
...tiresome and boring.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.299
[Lisbon]
Ah, Ms. Robbins, hi.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.040
We're sorry
to bother you this late.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.433
No, please, call me Cayce.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.130
I hope I didn't make
you guys wait too long.

18:08.217 --> 18:10.263
I was just doing
a favor for a friend.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.699
Uh, we just
had some questions.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.004
We talked to Curtis Wiley.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.789
Oh. I bet
he had a lot to say.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.921
- Yeah, he's very upset.
- Mm.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.140
He'svery upset?

18:20.490 --> 18:22.884
Look, I, I didn't
expect anything

18:22.971 --> 18:26.192
and I'm honored that Elise
even wanted to give me Songbird

18:26.279 --> 18:29.847
but changing the will
affects the foundation.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.501
What do you mean,
changing the will?

18:31.588 --> 18:32.807
You don't know?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.548
I-I just got
a call from the lawyers

18:34.635 --> 18:37.333
and the doctor said Elise
was non compos mentis.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.856
The will isn't valid.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.554
And that affects
the foundation?

18:40.641 --> 18:42.643
Well, Elise left her seat
on the foundation board

18:42.730 --> 18:44.645
to the chaplain
of the soldiers' home.

18:44.732 --> 18:47.300
That goes, too,
with the will thrown out.

18:47.387 --> 18:48.562
That's interesting.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.000
Thank you for your time.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.483
Look, she wasn't crazy,
you know.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.575
It was just those pills
that doctor had her on.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.229
That's what
made her like that.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.970
Uh, they were actually
just a mild sleeping aid.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.494
We checked.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.105
Well, there was more
than just those pills.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.280
[Cayce]
A lot more.

19:12.629 --> 19:14.327
I thought
you understood that.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.382
Alright. What have you
got for me on Reinhardt?

19:26.469 --> 19:27.775
Well, it looks like
Elise's sailing friend

19:27.862 --> 19:29.559
might have had it right.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.344
Took some digging.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.476
[Lisbon]
'Negligent homicide?
Where's this from?'

19:33.563 --> 19:34.825
Monaco.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.784
You see why
the charge was brought?

19:36.871 --> 19:38.742
Overprescribing
a pain medication.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.396
Bingo.

19:40.483 --> 19:41.963
It was treated as
a terrible mistake at the time

19:42.050 --> 19:43.747
and the charges
were eventually dropped.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.880
Still, it's not something
that would inspire confidence

19:45.967 --> 19:47.316
'in Reinhardt's patients.'

19:47.403 --> 19:48.361
Yeah, which is probably why

19:48.448 --> 19:49.405
a great deal of effort's

19:49.492 --> 19:50.450
been made to cover it all up.

19:50.537 --> 19:51.842
Uh, what about the records

19:51.929 --> 19:53.322
for what he was
prescribing for Elise?

19:53.409 --> 19:55.150
Trying to get a hold of 'em.
We may need a warrant.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.370
Talk to Reinhardt. See how he
reacts when you confront him.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.632
Sure. Should I take Cho?

19:58.719 --> 19:59.807
I sent him
to the soldiers' home.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.069
Okay.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.686
[indistinct chattering]

20:15.170 --> 20:16.954
You must be Agent Cho
with the CBI?

20:17.041 --> 20:18.391
That's right.

20:18.478 --> 20:19.696
Like I told
Agent Lisbon on the phone

20:19.783 --> 20:21.002
I don't want
to get anyone in trouble

20:21.089 --> 20:22.046
but I think those two have been

20:22.133 --> 20:23.526
plotting this for some time.

20:23.613 --> 20:24.571
Wait. Slow down.

20:24.658 --> 20:25.920
Who was plotting what?

20:26.007 --> 20:27.922
The nephew and that doctor.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.663
I didn't realize it
at the time

20:29.750 --> 20:30.968
but I think they've been
working together for a while.

20:31.055 --> 20:31.969
And what makes you say that?

20:32.056 --> 20:33.144
Uh, about a week ago

20:33.232 --> 20:34.494
they came in to talk to Elise.

20:34.581 --> 20:35.886
They must have
been talking about

20:35.973 --> 20:37.105
the future
of soldiers' home.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.628
You sure about that?

20:38.715 --> 20:40.891
Okay. Here's what I saw..

20:40.978 --> 20:43.067
Elise was outside talking
with Lissie Calhoun

20:43.154 --> 20:45.026
when Wiley
and Reinhardt appeared.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.071
The-the conversation
got very heated.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.900
Now Lissie Calhoun she's
the nurse, served in Vietnam?

20:49.987 --> 20:52.338
Yeah, I know Agent Lisbon
wanted to talk to her

20:52.425 --> 20:53.991
but she hasn't been in
for the last few days.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.645
Do you have her address?

20:55.732 --> 20:58.039
Yeah. I think I do.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.258
Follow me.

21:02.435 --> 21:05.307
[sighs]
Uh, Lisbon, I'm sorry

21:05.394 --> 21:06.352
but I think we
might have to get back

21:06.439 --> 21:07.744
to the crime scene.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.833
Really? That place
was so creepy.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.705
Yes but I-I'm worried

21:11.792 --> 21:13.533
we might have missed something
because of that.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.752
Okay, fine, but no jumping out
and yelling "boo" at me

21:15.839 --> 21:17.450
or anything like that.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.278
I mean, seriously,
what do you take me for?

21:19.365 --> 21:21.715
I am not going to answer that
because I'm a nice person.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.938
[male #2]
'She paid through the month'

21:28.025 --> 21:29.940
'but said she was going
to visit a friend.'

21:30.027 --> 21:31.028
Did she say where?

21:31.115 --> 21:32.508
No, she didn't.

21:32.595 --> 21:33.857
What'd she do this time?

21:33.944 --> 21:35.903
Told her any more of it,
I'd throw her out.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.514
Three strikes.
That's my rule.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.429
She hasn't done anything.
I just wanna talk to her.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.695
Don't get me wrong. You know,
Lissie's good people.

21:45.782 --> 21:49.003
'But she's got
impulse control issues'

21:49.090 --> 21:51.310
and problems
with anger management.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.051
Think maybe she saw
stuff over in Vietnam

21:54.138 --> 21:56.140
that nobody should see,
you know?

21:56.227 --> 21:57.620
Yeah, I know.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.759
Plus she drinks. That's probably
where she is now.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.851
So you think the friend
she's visiting is made up?

22:10.938 --> 22:12.287
All I know is, I told her

22:12.374 --> 22:14.115
she can't stay here
if she's not sober.

22:14.202 --> 22:16.552
I can't put up with that.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.206
[Brooks]
'She may have been
America's tragic heiress'

22:18.293 --> 22:21.078
'but she sure
knew how to throw a party.'

22:21.165 --> 22:24.647
Look at these photos,
hot and cold running servants.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.258
Fine food, champagne and wine.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.827
'That must have
been something to see.'

22:30.914 --> 22:33.090
'She went crazy I guess.'

22:35.266 --> 22:37.660
[instrumental music]

22:47.757 --> 22:49.411
- Uh, Lisbon?
- What?

22:49.498 --> 22:52.153
Come take a look at this.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.373
Look at this shelf.
Tell me what you see.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.462
Mm, a picture frame,
a silver candlestick

22:56.549 --> 22:58.464
an old lace doily.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.031
[Jane]
One lace doily.

23:01.118 --> 23:02.511
The other doily's missing?

23:02.598 --> 23:04.339
Yes. Now look at this.

23:06.167 --> 23:10.214
On this shelf,
what is it..

23:10.301 --> 23:11.694
...that you don't see?

23:13.827 --> 23:15.698
Well, that medal's gone.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.352
I knew we missed something.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.399
Okay, will do, boss.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.883
Jane thinks some kind
of small commemorative object

23:26.970 --> 23:29.016
was stolen
from the Vogelsong house.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.321
Huh?

23:31.845 --> 23:34.282
Never mind.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.806
[sighs]
So you're still on
that computer dating site, huh?

23:36.893 --> 23:39.026
[chuckles]
Yeah. It's really cool.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.637
[Rigsby]
'You can customize the kind
of woman you wanna meet.'

23:41.724 --> 23:43.552
Have you actually
made any dates

23:43.639 --> 23:45.598
or are you just hesitating
and second-guessing yourself

23:45.685 --> 23:47.034
like you usually do?

23:47.121 --> 23:49.819
Yeah, I've made dates,
several. So there.

23:49.906 --> 23:52.300
Glad to hear it.

23:52.387 --> 23:55.129
But maybe you can also help
around the office a little bit.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.565
Meaning?

23:56.652 --> 23:58.306
Isn't that the Reinhart
warrant on your desk?

23:58.393 --> 24:00.308
No, I've been waiting
on the Reinhardt warrant for..

24:01.701 --> 24:02.876
Oh, crap!

24:15.454 --> 24:17.456
Dr. Reinhardt will see you
as soon as he can.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.501
You understand
I'm an officer of the law

24:19.588 --> 24:20.850
investigating
a murder case?

24:20.937 --> 24:22.417
The doctor is with
a patient right now.

24:22.504 --> 24:26.769
[whirring]
But as soon as he's done..

24:26.856 --> 24:27.988
[female #1]
'Hey!'

24:29.250 --> 24:30.947
Get away from the machine.

24:31.034 --> 24:34.473
It's not what you think.
I-I didn't do anything.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.780
Phenobarbital.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.608
[Rigsby]
'Clonazepam.'

24:39.695 --> 24:41.218
Diazepam.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.177
Thorazine.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.266
Looks to me
like you did quite a lot.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.660
Hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.364
Hey, I think I found
your missing object.

24:56.451 --> 24:57.583
Oh, yeah?

25:02.762 --> 25:04.590
It's called the Vogelsong Medal.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.505
And apparently,
it's kind of a big deal.

25:06.592 --> 25:09.072
That's from Channel 7 News
a few years ago.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.858
[man on TV]
'Elise Vogelsong
welcomes foreign dignitaries'

25:11.945 --> 25:14.861
'to the Annual
Vogelsong Foundation Dinner'

25:14.948 --> 25:18.865
'wearing the renowned
and priceless Vogelsong Medal.'

25:18.952 --> 25:20.606
[clicks]

25:20.693 --> 25:23.086
Priceless, huh? That explains
why somebody stole it.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.480
Except that it's only priceless
when it's the Vogelsong Medal.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.047
What does that mean?

25:27.134 --> 25:28.352
Well, melt it down,
it's worth almost nothing

25:28.439 --> 25:29.353
but keep it as
the Vogelsong Medal

25:29.440 --> 25:31.181
you can't sell it.

25:31.268 --> 25:34.358
So with all the treasures
in that house, why take that?

25:34.445 --> 25:36.578
[Rigsby]
'Beats me.'

25:36.665 --> 25:38.624
Uh, what about Dr. Reinhardt?
Did you talk to him?

25:38.711 --> 25:40.277
I'm about to.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.018
With the amount
that he was prescribing her

25:42.105 --> 25:44.064
it's no wonder people thought
she was losing her mind.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.022
I'm amazed
she could stay upright.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.856
[door opens]

25:53.943 --> 25:56.729
Okay, I did not want
to prescribe her those pills.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.513
'She made me do it.'

25:58.600 --> 26:00.123
She blackmailed me.

26:00.210 --> 26:03.257
Okay, you can take a seat.

26:03.344 --> 26:07.000
So an old lady with
rapidly progressing dementia..

26:07.087 --> 26:10.264
You gonna say that she was
the bad guy in this situation?

26:10.351 --> 26:12.483
It's true.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.661
I don't know how she found out
about my past, but she did.

26:15.748 --> 26:16.879
And she said
she'd tell everybody

26:16.966 --> 26:19.752
unless I didwhat she said.

26:19.839 --> 26:23.494
I-I just want to help people.
I'm-I'm a good doctor.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.062
She would have
ruined my career.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.195
'She was a cruel
and vindictive woman'

26:28.282 --> 26:32.373
willing to do anything
just...to get her way.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.375
So you weren't conspiring
with Curtis Wiley

26:34.462 --> 26:36.203
to undo
Elise Vogelsong's will?

26:36.290 --> 26:37.944
What? No.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.641
But you and Wiley did have
a conversation with Elise

26:39.728 --> 26:41.208
outside the soldiers' home,
did you not?

26:41.295 --> 26:42.818
Elise asked me
to meet her there.

26:42.905 --> 26:44.777
Th-that was
the first and only time

26:44.864 --> 26:48.432
I ever met Curtis Wiley,
I swear on my mother's grave.

26:48.519 --> 26:51.261
I voided that will because
I believe Elise Vogelsong

26:51.348 --> 26:53.655
not to be
in her right mind.

26:53.742 --> 26:55.265
That's the only reason.

26:56.963 --> 26:59.356
[intense music]

27:02.708 --> 27:04.318
I tracked down
Lissie Calhoun in Vegas.

27:04.405 --> 27:05.928
She used a credit card
yesterday to get a room.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.408
Should I send
somebody out to go get her?

27:07.495 --> 27:08.844
Pass it on to the locals,
have them drop in

27:08.931 --> 27:09.889
see what she has to say.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.630
Will do.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.762
Oh, and I got some intel
on the lawsuit

27:13.849 --> 27:15.155
from one of the clerks
in the probate office.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.504
Why can't we get
a judge on the phone?

27:16.591 --> 27:17.940
Oh, he's stuck
in some mediation thing.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.812
Stay on the judge.
What did the clerk say?

27:19.899 --> 27:21.814
Basically, trusts and estates
law is pretty arcane stuff

27:21.901 --> 27:23.206
but the clerk
was pretty certain

27:23.293 --> 27:24.338
that Elise Vogelsong
was gonna win.

27:24.425 --> 27:26.340
Okay.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.515
I-I wanna get a warrant

27:27.602 --> 27:28.951
to search Curtis Wiley's home

27:29.038 --> 27:30.605
and place of business.

27:30.692 --> 27:31.650
I wanna lean on him hard.

27:31.737 --> 27:32.868
You got it.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.789
[door opens]

27:42.791 --> 27:44.967
Hello, agents.
Uh, Curtis is painting out back.

27:45.054 --> 27:46.839
- Should I go get him?
- That won't be necessary.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.536
This is a warrant
to search your business.

27:48.623 --> 27:49.972
Could you step aside
from the desk, please?

27:50.059 --> 27:51.321
What?

27:51.408 --> 27:54.063
Step away from
the desk, please.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.804
Curtis,
the police are here.

27:55.891 --> 27:58.198
We've already searched
your home. This won't take long.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.895
My husband will
put a stop to this.

27:59.982 --> 28:01.418
No, he won't.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.072
What's going on here?

28:03.159 --> 28:05.161
This is a warrant that
was issued by a judge.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.250
[Lisbon]
'It authorizes me
to search your business'

28:07.337 --> 28:10.123
your vehicle,
and your persons.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.821
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

28:12.908 --> 28:15.389
Where were you
the night of the murder?

28:15.476 --> 28:18.348
I-I was here at the gallery
going over paperwork.

28:18.435 --> 28:21.221
- Alone?
- No.

28:21.308 --> 28:24.746
No, I-I was here, too.
W-we were both here together.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.182
I think you're lying.

28:26.269 --> 28:28.097
[Cho]
'Hey, boss, I found something.'

28:28.184 --> 28:30.186
Hey. Those are
my personal art supplies.

28:30.273 --> 28:32.232
There's, there's nothing
back there that you need.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.103
Really?

28:34.190 --> 28:36.410
This is an art supply?

28:36.497 --> 28:39.065
My great-grandfather's medal.
Where did you get that?

28:39.152 --> 28:41.807
Back there. It was wrapped
in this. Smells like sterno.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.591
No!

28:43.678 --> 28:46.768
I'm arresting you for
the murder of Elise Vogelsong.

28:46.855 --> 28:47.987
What..

28:55.255 --> 28:57.387
Your client was locked
in a bitter legal dispute

28:57.474 --> 28:59.738
with the victim over
an extended period of time.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.088
Realizing that he had little
or no chance of winning the suit

29:02.175 --> 29:03.176
he set about trying
to get rid of her.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.743
Oh, this is ridiculous.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.310
'This..'

29:07.397 --> 29:11.488
You found an ally in the form
of Dr. Lance Reinhardt

29:11.575 --> 29:13.577
and together, they started
drugging Elise Vogelsong

29:13.664 --> 29:15.971
in carefully calibrated doses
so that the world around her

29:16.058 --> 29:17.277
would believe that
she was going mad.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.845
I met the man once. Once.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.063
'The murder would
look to the world'

29:21.150 --> 29:22.456
like a terrible accident.

29:22.543 --> 29:23.762
'Just another in a line'

29:23.849 --> 29:25.720
of tragedies
that Elise Vogelsong

29:25.807 --> 29:27.069
had suffered in her life

29:27.156 --> 29:29.158
and Curtis would
inherit everything.

29:29.245 --> 29:31.508
This is slanderous. What he's
saying is slander, isn't it?

29:31.595 --> 29:33.728
Curtis, please.

29:33.815 --> 29:37.558
It's all very neat, but it is
completely circumstantial.

29:37.645 --> 29:40.648
You presented nothing but
innuendo and scurrilous gossip.

29:40.735 --> 29:43.694
Except for the fact
that your client

29:43.782 --> 29:46.915
couldn't resist taking
something from the victim.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.787
'Something that
represented everything'

29:48.874 --> 29:50.789
she stood for
as a Vogelsong.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.926
The Vogelsong Medal.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.320
No..

30:00.407 --> 30:02.670
Which he wrapped in a doily
taken from the house.

30:04.106 --> 30:08.763
And that doily still
has traces of the sterno

30:08.850 --> 30:11.548
he used to light
his aunt on fire.

30:11.635 --> 30:14.769
Now...it's just a matter
of which one is quickest

30:14.856 --> 30:17.641
to make a deal
and testify against the other.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.687
I'm quite sure
that Dr. Reinhardt

30:19.774 --> 30:20.993
is signing
a plea deal right now

30:21.080 --> 30:22.298
but if your client's
clever enough

30:22.385 --> 30:23.647
he might be able
to save his own neck

30:23.734 --> 30:25.040
and just serve life
without parole.

30:25.127 --> 30:28.435
Deal? Uh-uh.
I'm innocent. No.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.916
That was planted on me
by you for all I know.

30:31.003 --> 30:32.874
- I'm innocent!
- Well, it's your choice.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.748
Don't move
and don'tsay a word.

30:40.621 --> 30:42.144
Agent, please.

30:44.146 --> 30:45.756
Give me a minute.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.935
I'm sure I can
talk sense into him.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.240
Don't take the deal
off the table.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.676
Sure.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.200
Talk to your client.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.378
[instrumental music]

31:06.952 --> 31:08.605
[Lisbon]
They're gonna turn
on each other.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.390
It is gonna be
an open and shut case

31:10.477 --> 31:12.653
by the time we get it
before a judge.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.350
[Jane]
Hmm. It all fits.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.179
I'll give you that.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.615
Yeah.

31:18.702 --> 31:21.009
A psychological motive
for stealing the medal

31:21.096 --> 31:23.707
is particularly compelling.

31:23.794 --> 31:26.362
But there's something
about it that's not right.

31:26.449 --> 31:28.147
What do you mean?
We've got a killer.

31:28.234 --> 31:29.888
We've got motive
and we got conclusive evidence.

31:29.975 --> 31:32.020
- What more do you need?
- I don't know yet.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.587
Oh, you're just
being contrary.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.894
No, I-I swear I'm not.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.896
- Hey, Cho.
- Hey, boss.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.246
Just talked to the probate
judge. He finally got in touch.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.508
Really? What'd he say?

31:41.595 --> 31:42.552
Well, he said
that in discovery

31:42.639 --> 31:43.814
widespread malfeasance was found

31:43.902 --> 31:45.077
in the running
of the foundation.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.121
What does that mean?

31:46.208 --> 31:47.514
It means that
Elise Vogelsong

31:47.601 --> 31:49.211
had run through
her entire inheritance

31:49.298 --> 31:50.647
and was plundering the coffers
of the soldiers' home

31:50.734 --> 31:52.040
to line her own pockets.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.563
In the past few months

31:53.650 --> 31:54.608
she nearly emptied
the bank accounts.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.001
Elise Vogelsong? The victim?

31:56.088 --> 31:57.263
The whole matter
was gonna be referred

31:57.350 --> 31:59.004
to the district
attorney's office.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.310
Not only was the ruling
going to be a complete victory

32:01.397 --> 32:02.703
for Curtis Wiley,

32:02.790 --> 32:04.531
but Elise Vogelsong
was going to jail.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.402
So you're telling me
that sweet old lady

32:06.489 --> 32:08.796
that was murdered
was really a liar and a cheat?

32:08.883 --> 32:10.450
Yeah, and soldiers' home
is bankrupt.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.495
And Curtis Wiley
murdered his aunt

32:12.582 --> 32:14.019
for a lawsuit
he was gonna win?

32:14.106 --> 32:15.455
And if he waited a week

32:15.542 --> 32:17.326
he would've gotten
everything he wanted.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.894
That's horrible.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.462
And I was just gonna take
her ashes down to the boat.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.638
Oh, so that the girl
could scatter them at sea?

32:24.725 --> 32:25.944
That's very kind
of you, Lisbon.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.206
Well, I'm not gonna do it now.

32:27.293 --> 32:28.511
I'm gonna have
somebody call her.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.252
She can come pick
'em up herself.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.603
Do you mind if I do it?

32:33.690 --> 32:39.044
I-I like the idea of giving
this girl some closure.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.133
Don't tell me you've gotten
sentimental all of a sudden.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.831
Not at all. I just think
it's the right thing to do.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.789
I'll call you when I'm done.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.496
Hey.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.628
How's the, uh,
computer dating thing going?

32:58.715 --> 33:00.543
Great. Yeah. Great.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.632
I haven't met miss right
yet, but, you know

33:02.719 --> 33:06.332
I'm out there on the prowl,
just...moving on, like I said.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.595
Hmm. That's funny.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.075
There must be some mistake then.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.554
'There's several
women out there'

33:11.641 --> 33:13.774
'who say some guy's
running a scam online'

33:13.861 --> 33:15.428
where he pretends
to be a handsome CBI cop

33:15.515 --> 33:17.256
named Wayne Rigsby
and makes dates with women

33:17.343 --> 33:19.258
'and then he
doesn't show up.'

33:19.345 --> 33:20.868
It's weird, huh?

33:20.955 --> 33:23.175
Hmm.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.916
That is weird. Uh...
they're by the elevator?

33:26.613 --> 33:27.788
Yeah.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.853
Hi, la, oh, wow.
There's five of you.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.204
Um...so I can explain.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.206
Uh..

33:57.861 --> 33:59.515
[Cayce]
Wow. I'm..

33:59.602 --> 34:02.170
I mean, I'm, I'm glad that
they found who killed Elise.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.955
It's just...
it's all so sad, you know?

34:05.043 --> 34:06.870
Hmm.

34:06.957 --> 34:10.178
Maybe now Elise
can rest in peace.

34:10.265 --> 34:12.180
- Are those the ashes?
- Uh, yes.

34:12.267 --> 34:13.834
I, uh,
I remember you saying

34:13.921 --> 34:15.314
you wanted to
scatter them at sea

34:15.401 --> 34:17.403
so I, I brought 'em
with me.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.059
Wow. Thank you.

34:21.146 --> 34:23.757
Uh, I-I, I really
appreciate this.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.455
Um, I know this is what
Elise would've wanted.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.979
Sure.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.633
Let's go, shall we?

34:32.722 --> 34:34.115
Oh. What are you doing?

34:34.202 --> 34:35.899
Oh, I always wanted
to take a boat trip

34:35.986 --> 34:38.598
and this is a particularly
nice boat, isn't it?

34:38.685 --> 34:40.339
You-you know, I don't think
it's a very good idea.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.602
You're very, uh,
inexperienced

34:42.689 --> 34:44.082
and it can get
very dangerous.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.605
It'll be absolutely fine.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.433
Uh, you got
an emergency kit here.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.610
That's good, which reminds me,
I should take a little bit

34:50.697 --> 34:53.352
of the old motion
sickness medication

34:53.439 --> 34:56.268
just as a precaution.
There we go and one of these.

34:56.355 --> 34:59.227
Marine flare, huh? Wow.

34:59.314 --> 35:00.707
- Okay. You know what? Um..
- 'Cool.'

35:00.794 --> 35:02.361
You ever had
to use one of these things?

35:02.448 --> 35:03.449
[hissing]
Uh-oh.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.233
Uh-oh. Oh! Oh!

35:05.320 --> 35:06.800
Smoke! That's hot!

35:06.887 --> 35:08.932
Calm down.
Give me, oh, my God.

35:09.019 --> 35:11.152
Oh! Uh, sorry!

35:13.981 --> 35:16.505
Uh, mayday! Girl overboard!

35:17.245 --> 35:19.247
Get some help!

35:19.334 --> 35:21.423
'Uh...help!'

35:21.510 --> 35:22.685
Sorry! Sorry!

35:22.772 --> 35:25.079
[woman coughing]
Yep.

35:25.166 --> 35:28.561
[Jane]
'Hello?
I know you're down there.'

35:28.648 --> 35:29.997
Ah!

35:30.084 --> 35:33.131
Elise Vogelsong, I presume.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.697
And that looks like
the money you stole

35:34.784 --> 35:38.136
from the soldiers' home.
Let's go!

35:38.223 --> 35:39.789
- I'll get the one in the water.
- 'Oh.'

35:42.879 --> 35:44.446
Who are you?
What are you doing on my boat?

35:44.533 --> 35:46.274
My name is Patrick Jane.

35:46.361 --> 35:47.667
He's an agent with the CBI

35:47.754 --> 35:50.365
and you, my dear,
are under arrest!

35:53.455 --> 35:55.588
Bon voyage.

36:06.468 --> 36:07.600
[door opens]

36:22.484 --> 36:24.269
I didn't know about the money.

36:24.356 --> 36:25.487
I swear.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.274
And I didn't know she
was gonna hurt anybody.

36:29.361 --> 36:30.971
Somebody did get hurt.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.320
Lissie Calhoun died.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.545
She told me that her family

36:39.632 --> 36:42.374
was trying to get her
put away in a home.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.202
I was just trying
to protect her.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.293
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.904
But you weren't, Cayce, and now
you're an accessory to murder.

36:50.991 --> 36:54.908
I'm not. I'm not,
I'm not. I-I can't be.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.215
I would never.
You have to believe me.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.177
You know, she was probably
planning to kill you, too?

37:07.573 --> 37:09.444
You were never getting
off that boat.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.756
I feel really stupid.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.241
What am I gonna do?

37:24.285 --> 37:25.547
Testify.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.245
We'll make
a fair deal for you

37:27.332 --> 37:29.725
but you have to
play straight with us, okay?

37:29.812 --> 37:30.987
I will.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.425
I promise.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.080
I believe you.

37:55.534 --> 37:56.491
[sniffles]

37:57.623 --> 37:59.494
So what if I took the money?

37:59.581 --> 38:03.585
My grandfather made it.
It was mine by right.

38:03.672 --> 38:06.284
But Curtis wouldn't have
seen it that way, would he?

38:06.371 --> 38:07.328
Curtis?

38:07.415 --> 38:09.417
Nosey little brat, that one..

38:09.504 --> 38:12.115
...ever since he was a child.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.901
That's why
you contested the codicil.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.686
You didn't want Curtis
on the foundation board.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.645
Him, judging me?

38:19.732 --> 38:23.518
Telling me how to run my
foundation, spend my money?

38:23.605 --> 38:26.260
Oh. Would've been
unendurable.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.957
So you hatched your plan.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.655
You found a doctor
you could blackmail

38:29.742 --> 38:30.960
to get the pills
you needed.

38:31.047 --> 38:33.136
Uh, was Cayce
in on the plan?

38:33.223 --> 38:35.182
I told her that Curtis
and the rest of them

38:35.269 --> 38:37.358
were plotting against me

38:37.445 --> 38:40.753
that it was
the only way I could escape.

38:40.840 --> 38:44.844
And she was already convinced
that I was the mother

38:44.931 --> 38:47.977
she never had. Hmph.

38:48.064 --> 38:51.024
Girls like that
are so naive and foolish.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.373
Oh.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.028
And what about
Lissie Calhoun?

38:55.115 --> 38:57.160
Was she
naive and foolish also?

38:58.945 --> 39:01.426
That was
an unfortunate necessity.

39:03.558 --> 39:08.476
[Elise]
But the woman
was a tortured soul.

39:08.563 --> 39:13.046
What I did
was an act of mercy.

39:13.133 --> 39:16.876
And, uh, I made sure
that her death was..

39:16.963 --> 39:18.704
...a peaceful one.

39:18.791 --> 39:19.922
[flames crackling]

39:23.404 --> 39:25.014
'You certainly did.'

39:25.101 --> 39:27.582
Overdosing her on barbiturates
and burning her to ash

39:27.669 --> 39:29.323
that is
a peaceful way to go.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.719
Then all that was left was
sending Cayce to Las Vegas

39:33.806 --> 39:36.286
to rent a room with
the dead woman's credit card

39:36.374 --> 39:38.767
and planting evidence
on your nephew.

39:38.854 --> 39:39.986
Yeah.

39:41.509 --> 39:42.989
That was rather fun.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.775
Even if it did mean
having to enter

39:46.862 --> 39:48.777
that tacky
little shop of theirs.

39:50.997 --> 39:53.216
Curtis had been eyeing
grandfather's medals

39:53.303 --> 39:55.218
since he was a boy.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.398
[elevator dings]

40:04.924 --> 40:06.099
Thank you, Mr. Jane.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.449
Thank you
for saving my husband.

40:08.536 --> 40:11.583
Despite your colleague's
best efforts to imprison him.

40:11.670 --> 40:12.845
Oh.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.107
Ah.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.721
You can, uh, thank me by

40:19.808 --> 40:22.245
forgiving my colleague,
Agent Lisbon

40:22.332 --> 40:24.204
and keeping
the old soldier's home open.

40:24.291 --> 40:25.901
Oh, don't worry.

40:25.988 --> 40:26.902
Soldiers' home will
stay open as long as there are

40:26.989 --> 40:29.427
veterans who need it.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.168
And we forgive you,
Agent Lisbon.

40:32.255 --> 40:33.431
Thanks.

40:34.823 --> 40:35.955
Bye.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.530
What?

40:45.617 --> 40:47.314
We followed the evidence.

40:47.401 --> 40:49.185
You, you did.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.710
You...followed the evidence.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.757
Okay. Okay, I was wrong.

40:55.844 --> 40:58.673
- Hmm.
- But we followed the evidence.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.066
You know what gave me
second thoughts

41:00.153 --> 41:01.763
about Elise Vogelsong?

41:01.850 --> 41:03.983
She read too many
murder mystery novels.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.985
There you go.
That's not police work.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.247
That's guessing.

41:07.334 --> 41:08.901
You should try it sometime.

41:08.988 --> 41:11.077
Now I'm gonna pursue
Red John. Ciao.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.395
