00:09.777 --> 00:12.180
MAN ( over radio ):
Transport 334, we're hearing

00:12.213 --> 00:14.582
a tractor trailer
flipped over on 295.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.050
It's a parking lot.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.186
334, roger that.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.054
Tell the judge we're going
to be a little awhile.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.722
We'll peel off at New Kent.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.191
I'll take King Williams
to River Road.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.060
Nah, just take stay on 17
the whole way.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.161
Yeah, wait one.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.330
My wife is giving me directions.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.632
I don't want to take
the damn scenic route.

00:31.665 --> 00:35.169
You got all
those stoplights
in New Kent.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.170
( grunting )

00:36.204 --> 00:37.638
Oh God, I can't breathe!

00:41.109 --> 00:42.576
( tires squealing )

00:42.610 --> 00:44.312
Richie?

00:44.345 --> 00:45.379
Stop the bus.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.047
( tires squealing )

00:49.217 --> 00:51.119
Just pull it over
to the side.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.220
( groaning )

00:53.521 --> 00:54.588
( groans )

00:56.257 --> 00:57.791
Richie!

00:57.825 --> 00:58.592
You okay?

00:58.626 --> 01:02.163
( gasps )

01:06.700 --> 01:07.568
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:26.487 --> 01:30.291
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:30.324 --> 01:35.196
and CBS

02:15.869 --> 02:17.171
How'd it go?

02:17.205 --> 02:18.172
Perfect.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.740
Didn't feel a thing.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.741
Did White seem to buy it?

02:20.774 --> 02:21.842
He bought it, all right.

02:21.875 --> 02:22.376
He was scared.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.010
You could smell it.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.445
( phone rings )

02:24.478 --> 02:26.347
Hey, Gibbs.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.682
Yeah, I'm calling
about the VW convertible.

02:28.716 --> 02:29.683
What?

02:29.717 --> 02:31.252
The '92 VW for sale.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.820
You got the wrong number.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.622
Come on, Kate. We're moving.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.289
See ya.
Bye.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.725
( dialing phone )

02:37.758 --> 02:38.926
( phone ringing )

02:43.297 --> 02:44.198
Hello.

02:44.232 --> 02:44.965
You got him?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.667
Are you honestly asking me that?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.470
No, Abbs,
I called to flirt.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.971
Do you think I would send
our helpless boy

02:51.004 --> 02:52.406
out there in the world
without knowing

02:52.440 --> 02:53.407
exactly where he is?

02:53.441 --> 02:54.542
Abby, go to video.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.282
I thought you said
you had him.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.950
The GPS system has his position

03:02.983 --> 03:04.518
within four feet.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.553
You don't have him in the car?

03:05.586 --> 03:07.655
No, Abby, I do not!

03:11.325 --> 03:13.627
Okay, I got him now.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.496
You forgot to turn it on.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.564
Put McGee on.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.669
He wants you.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.471
How'd he know
I was here?

03:23.504 --> 03:24.838
Because he's Gibbs.

03:30.778 --> 03:31.945
Uh, yes, boss.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.981
I got people calling me
every five minutes

03:34.014 --> 03:36.284
asking if I have a VW for sale.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.551
A VW?

03:37.585 --> 03:39.253
It's a car, McGee.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.153
No, no, no. I know.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.989
I just didn't know
that you owned a VW.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.426
Do I seem like the kind of guy

03:45.459 --> 03:47.328
who would drive
a squishy little car?

03:47.361 --> 03:51.365
No. You know, it's probably
a used car listing in the paper

03:51.399 --> 03:52.199
with the wrong number

03:52.232 --> 03:54.302
that is, unfortunately,
your number.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.536
Do you think?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.405
You already figured that out.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.005
Fix it!

04:01.575 --> 04:02.910
How does he want me to fix it?

04:02.943 --> 04:04.011
You can't.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.413
You're doomed.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.047
So you better
get back to the case.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.616
( beeping )

04:08.649 --> 04:12.353
Okay, so where did you
finally put the GPS?

04:12.386 --> 04:14.622
I thought about
subdermal implantation.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.689
Under the skin?

04:15.723 --> 04:18.726
Yeah, like, maybe in his neck.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.561
Tony wouldn't go for it.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.830
But I would have loved
to have done that.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.366
Didn't consider
a suppository?

04:25.399 --> 04:26.434
I thought of it.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.368
Tony balked.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.702
Surprising.
Yeah.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.004
I put it in his shoe.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.706
It's really boring.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.941
( panting )

04:33.974 --> 04:35.643
( gasps )

04:36.510 --> 04:38.011
Wait.

04:38.045 --> 04:42.082
I can't...
I can't keep going.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.517
Get up and run!

04:43.551 --> 04:44.685
Let's go.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.955
Hey! I just killed a guy
back there.

04:47.988 --> 04:48.956
I am not getting caught.

04:48.989 --> 04:49.590
Let's get up and run!

04:49.623 --> 04:50.624
Move it!

04:50.658 --> 04:51.492
Let's go!

04:51.525 --> 04:52.225
If you kill me,

04:52.259 --> 04:53.994
you're going
to have to drag me.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.700
Okay. What's your name?

04:59.733 --> 05:01.769
Jeffrey.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.505
I'm Tony. You ever see
The Defiant Ones, Jeffrey?

05:04.538 --> 05:05.706
What?

05:05.739 --> 05:07.040
The movie, The Defiant Ones.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.609
Tony Curtis, Sidney Poitier?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.910
I think I'm having
an asthma attack.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.379
It's a great movie.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.380
These two guys, right?

05:12.413 --> 05:13.481
A black guy
and a white guy

05:13.514 --> 05:14.415
escape from
a Southern chain gang.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.116
They're chained together,
just like we are.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.918
We're not black.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.388
My grandmother was black.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.923
Oh. Okay, so, what happens?

05:22.956 --> 05:24.625
They fight each other
every step of the way.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.826
Tony Curtis has
an infected wrist,

05:25.859 --> 05:28.095
a bullet
in his shoulder...

05:28.128 --> 05:29.129
Really?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.932
Yeah. He had guts.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.601
Guts, Jeffrey.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.369
He doesn't want
to live in a cage.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.937
I don't want to
live in a cage.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.071
So we're going
to get up.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.573
Jeffrey, we're going
to get up

05:39.607 --> 05:41.074
and we're going
to get out of here.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.644
Who's Tony Curtis?
Who's Tony Curtis?

05:43.677 --> 05:47.948
You are. Let's go.
Let's go. Attaboy.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.822
( groans )

05:57.190 --> 05:58.158
Where's Gibbs?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.627
Who needs to know?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.495
I'm the new Senior
MTAC Control Officer.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.063
Where is he?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.898
He is in the field.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.500
The Director's Office called.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.768
In five minutes,

06:07.801 --> 06:10.471
the Deputy Secretary of State,
Anna Elliott...

06:10.504 --> 06:13.441
The Deputy Secretary
of the United States?

06:13.474 --> 06:14.708
No, Norway.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.043
She's coming on an MTAC.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.911
She's going to be
the State Department rep

06:17.945 --> 06:18.912
on the investigation.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.047
Get Gibbs fast.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.685
( phone rings )

06:24.718 --> 06:26.420
I don't have a VW for sale!

06:26.454 --> 06:28.055
Yeah, I-I know, boss.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.156
Switching to the car feed.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.764
The Deputy Secretary of State
is coming on an MTAC

06:36.797 --> 06:38.866
in five minutes
and she wants to speak with you.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.200
Handle it, McGee.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.902
Uh, excuse me?

06:41.935 --> 06:44.872
You are the highest-ranking
member of our team

06:44.905 --> 06:46.740
in the office. Deal with it.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.876
Do you think that's a good idea?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.043
This is a very powerful
and important

06:50.077 --> 06:50.944
government official...

06:50.978 --> 06:55.783
Boss? Boss?

07:11.064 --> 07:12.966
Agent Gibbs?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.235
Uh, no. No, ma'am.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.737
Agent Timothy McGee.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.739
Are you in charge
of this investigation?

07:18.772 --> 07:22.943
Uh, at this moment, uh...
here at NCIS headquarters, I am.

07:22.976 --> 07:26.013
Agent Gibbs
is unreachable in the field.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.850
Okay, give me the short version.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.853
Well, since the beginning
of the war,

07:32.886 --> 07:35.556
many very valuable Iraqi
antiquities

07:35.589 --> 07:37.691
have been smuggled out of Iraq.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.325
Roll it.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.760
You should be seeing them

07:39.793 --> 07:40.828
on your screen now.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.563
FBI and Customs have seized

07:42.596 --> 07:44.598
many of these pieces in the U.S.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.501
They were collected and stored
at Norfolk Naval Station

07:47.535 --> 07:48.736
for shipment back to Iraq.

07:48.769 --> 07:52.973
Many of these artifacts date
back from the Sumerian period.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.174
They're about 5,000 years old.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.009
Is this the short version?

07:56.043 --> 07:57.778
Y-Yes.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.112
Shorter.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.782
Faster and let's skip
the whole Sumerian period.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.884
Okay. Okay.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.919
Uh, they were stolen
by two civilian employees

08:05.953 --> 08:08.188
who were hired to crate them
for shipment back to Iraq.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.757
And how many pieces were taken?

08:09.790 --> 08:10.758
Eighty-seven.

08:10.791 --> 08:14.895
They were stolen
in-in a large Conex container

08:14.928 --> 08:17.164
roughly... 18 hours ago.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.600
One of the
thieves, Jeffrey White,

08:19.633 --> 08:22.603
picked up on a traffic violation
minutes after an APB went out.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.305
He is in custody... sort of.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.141
The other is Lane Harrison.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.879
He is, he is at large
with the Conex box.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.881
What does that mean,
"In custody, sort of"?

08:33.914 --> 08:36.049
If the Iraqi antiquities
are not recovered

08:36.083 --> 08:37.217
within 48 hours, statistically,

08:37.250 --> 08:40.320
they will probably be sold
into private art collections

08:40.353 --> 08:41.989
and lost forever.

08:42.022 --> 08:42.956
Okay, I'll ask again.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.225
What does that mean
"In custody, sort of"?

08:45.258 --> 08:49.863
Sorry. Uh, Jeffrey, Jeffrey
refused to talk,

08:49.897 --> 08:51.231
so we let him get away

08:51.264 --> 08:52.265
with an undercover agent,

08:52.299 --> 08:55.035
hoping that he would lead us
to the Conex box.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.972
You let the one that you had
in custody escape?

08:59.006 --> 09:02.275
With an undercover NCIS agent,
yes, ma'am.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.781
( sighs )

09:11.685 --> 09:13.253
( grunting )

09:16.924 --> 09:18.692
They did this
in The Defiant Ones.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.662
The chain represents
the unbreakable bond

09:21.695 --> 09:22.596
between all men.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.865
Every scene in that movie
is a metaphor.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.767
You don't talk
like a criminal.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.868
What'd you do?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.770
Okay, I didn't do anything.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.104
Let's get that crystal clear.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.073
I was landing my plane
in Virginia Beach

09:33.106 --> 09:34.107
on my way back from
the Dominican Republic.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.342
You're a pilot?

09:35.375 --> 09:39.780
Yeah, I was flying in
this rich couple.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.883
Customs found four keys
of cocaine in the luggage.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.084
It was the
rich couple's.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.318
I never saw it before.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.855
I'm sorry.
It's a tough break.

09:47.888 --> 09:48.956
Yeah.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.892
I was looking
at 25 to life.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.260
I wasn't going
to let that happen.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.729
And this isn't working.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.997
( grunts )

09:57.030 --> 10:01.201
All right.
We got to keep moving.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.103
You ready to be
Tony Curtis again?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.137
Uh-huh.

10:04.171 --> 10:07.641
All right. Here we go.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.642
This way.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.111
That's it. That's it.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.180
You are Tony Curtis.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.082
Yes.

10:16.784 --> 10:17.417
They're moving.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.852
( engine starts )

10:26.994 --> 10:29.262
( laughs )

10:29.296 --> 10:30.330
Yeah, baby.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.001
That's our ticket out of here.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.268
All right, let's find out
if anybody's home.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.403
( gasps )

10:36.436 --> 10:38.071
Watch it!
Watch it!

10:44.945 --> 10:48.415
( Jeffrey shrieking )

10:48.448 --> 10:50.250
Stop it! Stop it!

10:50.283 --> 10:52.352
Stop it! Shush!
Shh!

10:55.155 --> 10:56.790
I guess, I guess
no one's home, huh?

10:56.824 --> 10:59.192
They would have
heard us, right?

10:59.226 --> 11:00.894
You figured that out
yourself?

11:00.928 --> 11:02.095
You put that
all together!?

11:04.131 --> 11:07.134
Hey, was there anything
like this, like in the water

11:07.167 --> 11:09.036
in The Defiant Ones?

11:09.069 --> 11:10.270
( chuckles )

11:10.303 --> 11:14.174
Yeah. Yeah,
there was a scene

11:14.207 --> 11:16.009
where the two of them
nearly drowned.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.079
But that was a river.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.147
This is a river.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.083
No, Jeffrey, it's not.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.952
No, this is not a river,
Jeffrey.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.086
You know what this is?

11:26.119 --> 11:27.287
It's a stream.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.156
And you can't drown
in a stream, okay?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.491
You can get wet and you can
get frickin' freezing,

11:31.524 --> 11:32.960
but you can't drown!

11:32.993 --> 11:33.961
You look mad.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.096
Why are you mad?
We survived.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.497
Surviving in two feet
of water

11:37.530 --> 11:40.067
is not a heroic
accomplishment.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.103
It is when you have
a phobia of drowning.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.207
You look cold..

11:47.240 --> 11:48.809
I am cold.

11:48.842 --> 11:53.280
Okay. Let's see
if we can get inside.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.488
Lost him.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.023
I lost him, too!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.792
There's something wrong
with the GPS.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.227
God...

12:14.134 --> 12:16.103
( birds twittering )

12:18.038 --> 12:21.141
TONY:
The chicks
are going to love you.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.110
That'll be the day.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.112
Am I sensing a lack
of confidence here?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.880
Well, look at me.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.849
What have I got to
be confident about?

12:28.882 --> 12:32.519
Hey, pump a little iron,
get a tan,

12:32.552 --> 12:35.155
contact lenses...

12:36.189 --> 12:38.926
...caps, maybe a
little plastic surgery,

12:38.959 --> 12:41.862
and you'll be fine.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.799
Oh.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.201
Jeffrey, it's our lucky day.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.404
( Tony chuckles )

12:51.438 --> 12:53.874
You know, you've only been
with me four hours, Jeffrey.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.143
You realize how much
your life has changed?

12:56.176 --> 12:59.012
You're out of prison,
you got new threads,

12:59.046 --> 13:02.349
and you're riding in
a tricked-out GMC Sierra.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.984
Ow.
( laughs )

13:18.031 --> 13:20.400
( computer beeping )

13:20.433 --> 13:23.070
We got a signal from the truck.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.104
We're back in business, Gibbs.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.138
Good call on the trailer.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.840
Cash, clothes and a car.

13:26.874 --> 13:27.908
Everything Tony loves.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.276
Let's just hope he-/////!s
not headed for Vegas.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.283
Would you slow down?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.418
If I go any slower I'll be
going backwards, Jeffrey.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.088
Ah, these cuff are chaffing me.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.956
Maybe we should stop
and get you some lotion.

13:42.990 --> 13:43.957
Really?

13:43.991 --> 13:45.893
No, not really, Jeffrey.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.895
We're criminals on the run,

13:47.928 --> 13:49.897
and criminals on the run
don't stop and get lotion.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.264
Right.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.432
Okay, listen, just relax.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.968
I know some people
down in Florida.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.036
We can drive down there.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.939
Problem is, we can't stay
in this truck forever.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.874
It's probably LoJacked.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.910
I have a friend
who could help us.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.011
He's near here.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.279
You have a friend near here?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.580
And you were going
to tell me this when?

14:07.614 --> 14:09.049
Sorry.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.884
I just thought of it.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.052
Let's find a pay phone.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.154
( clicks tongue )

14:15.956 --> 14:18.325
WOMAN:
OnStar. How can we help you,
Mr. Reynolds?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.427
Hi, yeah, we'd like
to make a call.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.363
I'd be happy
to place that call for you.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.932
What is the number?

14:24.965 --> 14:27.334
Hold on a second?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.902
Let's get out of
these cuffs, Jeffery.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.437
What's the number?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.372
Come on.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.174
Watch out!

14:38.678 --> 14:41.514
( engine dieseling, stalls )

14:41.548 --> 14:44.317
Gibbs, it sounds like Tony
was in an accident.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.286
GIBBS:
Got it, Abby.
We're on it.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.924
I wasn't going to hit him.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.460
I saw him the whole time.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.162
I think I have a concussion.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.529
You didn't hit your
head on anything.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.698
The sticker says the
"airbags can be fatal."

14:58.731 --> 15:00.000
For children.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.470
( engine grinding )

15:04.704 --> 15:06.139
You okay?

15:06.173 --> 15:06.906
Uh...

15:07.607 --> 15:08.976
Yeah, we're cool.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.444
I called 911.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.181
Kate?

15:14.214 --> 15:15.382
Oh, no.
Who's Kate?

15:15.415 --> 15:16.449
My dog.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.085
She must've jumped out.
Kate!

15:18.118 --> 15:19.486
Kate!

15:19.519 --> 15:21.654
Come here, girl!
( smacks lips, whistles )

15:21.688 --> 15:24.291
( groans )

15:24.324 --> 15:26.293
( cries out in pain )

15:26.326 --> 15:28.661
( grunts ):
My leg.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.964
Can you move it?

15:30.998 --> 15:31.999
Wait here.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.100
I'll get her.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.735
What does she look like?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.105
A... shih tzu.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.039
A what?

15:39.072 --> 15:41.308
Long, brown hair, kind of mangy.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.744
Come on, Jeffrey.
Get the lead out.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.113
MAN:
Here, girl!
Wait, wait.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.547
Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Kate!

15:47.580 --> 15:49.749
Move it.
Here, girl!

15:49.782 --> 15:51.218
Kate!

15:51.251 --> 15:52.419
( grunts )

15:52.452 --> 15:53.753
Put your arm around.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.621
What?

15:54.654 --> 15:55.688
Okay, under. all right?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.291
( engine starting )

15:58.325 --> 16:00.527
Hey, what are you doing?!

16:04.731 --> 16:07.134
( sighs )

16:13.640 --> 16:17.510
Hey! Hey, hey!

16:18.045 --> 16:19.179
My bike was stolen.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.680
You gotta help me.
Who stole it?

16:20.713 --> 16:22.582
Two guys--
their truck went off the road.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.051
I was helping
find their dog.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.118
They had a dog?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.453
A shih tzu named Kate.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.389
They had a dog named Kate?

16:29.422 --> 16:31.058
What's a shih tzu?

16:31.091 --> 16:33.326
It's a little, annoying dog.
Did they describe it?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.661
Yeah, they said it
had long, brown hair.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.063
Kind of mangy.

16:36.096 --> 16:36.996
I'm going to shoot him.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.398
How much gas do you have left
in your tank?

16:38.431 --> 16:39.099
Almost nothing.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.268
Half-gallon, tops.
Let's go.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.735
Hey, what about my bike?

16:42.769 --> 16:43.736
We're going to find it.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.205
Great, that's great.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.539
What should I do?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.108
Find the dog.

17:01.788 --> 17:02.289
Loosen your grip.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.223
What?

17:03.256 --> 17:04.657
I can't breathe!

17:04.691 --> 17:06.526
My hand is numb,
I can't move it.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.661
Stop it.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.835
I'm going to fall off.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.670
You're not falling, Jeffrey.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.439
I can't ride
without hugging.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.373
Stop it.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.810
You and I are going
to have a long talk

17:23.843 --> 17:25.345
after this, Jeffrey.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.281
Come on, guys.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.483
Give me something to work with.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.693
Hah!

17:40.727 --> 17:42.295
JEFFREY:
It happened
on the way to arraignment.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.363
I had no choice.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.864
MAN ( on phone ):
Why the hell'd you run?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.299
I was handcuffed.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.734
What was I supposed to do?

17:47.767 --> 17:50.103
( man on phone
speaks indistinctly )

17:50.137 --> 17:52.272
Don't you sell that
without me, Lane.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.840
Okay.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.443
I know.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.077
I'm sorry.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.687
Lane is not happy
you're with me.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.123
Well, we cut the chain,
you'll never see me again.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.724
Could you fly me and
Lane out of the country?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.126
It's tricky, Jeffrey.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.196
We'd have to fly
below the radar.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.597
No transponder.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.598
Limited range.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.766
Won't be cheap.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.134
I could come up
with the money.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.402
It might make
Lane like you.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.770
I don't need Lane to like me.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.240
We get out of these cuffs,

18:27.274 --> 18:28.775
you can come with me,
if you want.

18:28.808 --> 18:29.809
Without Lane.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.544
Thanks. But I can't.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.780
Hey, could I drive?

18:33.813 --> 18:35.348
I'm getting a cramp
in this position.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.450
No.
You didn't even
think about it.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.751
Well, you ran into a tree.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.720
Trust me, you shouldn't be...

18:40.753 --> 18:43.890
( grunts in pain )

18:43.923 --> 18:46.125
...operating heavy machinery.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.630
Haven't seen 'em.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.499
Well, here's our number
if they come in.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.901
Sure.
Thanks.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.605
GIBBS:
What?

18:58.638 --> 18:59.906
You're worried.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.408
About what?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.142
Tony.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.077
You are. I can tell.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.946
I'm worried about the job, Kate.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.381
Don't confuse the two.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.916
( phone ringing )

19:09.949 --> 19:11.518
I sold it.

19:11.551 --> 19:14.554
ELLIOTT:
Where is Special Agent Gibbs?

19:14.587 --> 19:16.223
He... he is still in the field.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.890
Is he planning on coming back

19:17.924 --> 19:19.492
or am I doomed to speak to you

19:19.526 --> 19:21.461
for the duration
of this investigation?

19:21.494 --> 19:22.429
Ma'am, he is... he is searching
for a missing agent.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.832
The agent
chained to Jeffrey White?
Yes.

19:25.865 --> 19:26.966
When a fellow officer
is in trouble...

19:26.999 --> 19:31.238
So, you lost the agent
who is chained to Jeffrey White?

19:31.271 --> 19:32.071
Well, yes, but...

19:32.104 --> 19:33.506
Using the transitive
property then

19:33.540 --> 19:35.675
that leads me to the conclusion

19:35.708 --> 19:37.944
that NCIS
has lost Jeffrey White.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.646
No.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.948
No? Then you have Jeffrey White
in custody?

19:41.981 --> 19:43.816
Well, I-I...

19:43.850 --> 19:45.385
I...

19:45.418 --> 19:47.454
Call the minute you find him.

19:48.955 --> 19:52.459
Or whenever your mouth
begins to work again.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.661
Whichever comes first.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.018
I am not having this
conversation with you, Jeffrey.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.622
For the 300th and final time,
shut your pie hole.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.724
JEFFREY:
Okay. Okay, okay.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.327
TONY:
Stop talking.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.963
Just... just wait, wait.

20:35.935 --> 20:40.507
Hey, Lane.
Hey.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.275
That's Tony.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.276
How you doin'?

20:45.545 --> 20:46.613
Okay.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.318
She's not as comfortable
as she looks.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.454
Trust me.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.396
You killed a federal marshal?

21:03.430 --> 21:05.765
I don't know that I killed him.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.672
You don't strike me
the type to kill a man.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.973
Sorry to disappoint you.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.646
Did Jeffrey tell you
what we have going on?

21:20.813 --> 21:22.415
Ah, he just said
that you wanted me

21:22.449 --> 21:23.716
to fly you out of the country.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.684
That's all?

21:24.717 --> 21:25.852
Yeah, that's all.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.790
Jeffrey... manipulates easy.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.759
I'm not manipulating...

21:32.792 --> 21:34.461
No?

21:34.494 --> 21:36.028
No.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.597
You want me out of here,
I'm gone.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.868
There's no need to rush off.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.771
Unless you want to.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.574
( chuckles )

21:50.610 --> 21:52.011
Gotcha.

21:52.044 --> 21:55.081
Their names didn't bring up
any criminal records.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.049
That's because this print

21:57.083 --> 22:00.420
doesn't match Lane Harrison
or Jeffrey White.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.054
Meet Billy Collins.

22:03.723 --> 22:04.957
Oh, no.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.099
( Kate gasps )

22:13.132 --> 22:14.834
Oh.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.069
( phone ringing )
( groans )

22:17.103 --> 22:18.705
Yeah? Gibbs.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.573
McGEE:
We've got an ID.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.375
Boss, Lane Harrison is an alias.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.711
He has done time
for armed robbery and is wanted

22:24.744 --> 22:26.779
for three murders
in the Seattle area.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.515
What's his M.O.?

22:28.548 --> 22:30.850
ABBY:
According
to the autopsy reports...

22:32.619 --> 22:33.953
Abby?

22:35.755 --> 22:38.090
He was a regular
Mack the Knife, Gibbs.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.493
Their throats were cut
from behind.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.636
There's a bed.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.045
It'll help you sleep.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.752
Thanks.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.920
( grunts )

23:29.909 --> 23:31.511
McGEE:
We now believe
that Jeffrey White

23:31.544 --> 23:33.813
and Lane Harrison
are not who they say they are.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.182
We've linked them
to several murders.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.984
You put your agent
with murderers...

23:38.017 --> 23:39.486
Yes, but we didn't know.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.087
...and then you lost contact
with your agent,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.822
Yes, but...
and you still have no idea

23:42.855 --> 23:44.457
where in the world he is.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.592
No, but...

23:45.625 --> 23:47.660
And you have no idea where
the Iraqi antiquities are.

23:47.694 --> 23:50.196
Well, no-no, we-we don't.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.931
Not a clue?

23:51.964 --> 23:53.733
Not a clue.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.102
You ever worked at the
post office, Agent McGee?

23:56.135 --> 23:57.103
No, ma'am.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.672
You ever clean toilets
at a federal campground?

23:59.706 --> 24:01.674
No, ma'am.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.777
If these antiquities
are not found immediately,

24:04.811 --> 24:06.713
you will not even be able to get

24:06.746 --> 24:08.748
those two
federal government jobs.

24:10.717 --> 24:11.951
Am I clear?

24:17.089 --> 24:18.925
He's leaving bread crumbs.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.694
( dialing )

24:23.863 --> 24:27.767
( phone ringing )

24:27.800 --> 24:28.935
McGee.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.236
Hey.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.639
Pull the records
on a pay phone number for me.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.607
Ready.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.777
The number is 804

24:37.810 --> 24:41.748
555-0178.

24:41.781 --> 24:42.982
Seven, eight.
Okay, got it.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.584
Compare the numbers
to the ones we have

24:44.617 --> 24:45.852
on Jeffrey White
or Lane Harrison.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.554
Family, friends, anything.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.222
Uh, look, boss,
the Deputy Secretary of State,

24:50.256 --> 24:51.691
she-she keeps calling.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.292
She keeps threatening things.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.994
Things? What kind of things?

24:55.027 --> 24:58.130
Not letting us clean toilets,
other jobs like that.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.632
Hey, McGee,

24:59.666 --> 25:00.733
calm down.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.134
Okay.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.136
Sorry. I'm calm now.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.005
Okay, I'm going to tell you
how to handle this.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.874
Next time she calls,

25:07.907 --> 25:09.909
you give her two words
from the bottom of your heart.

25:09.942 --> 25:10.843
Two words.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.746
Stick it.

25:13.780 --> 25:14.747
"Stick it"?

25:14.781 --> 25:16.616
I-I'm not sure that I...

25:16.649 --> 25:18.918
( phone disconnects )

25:24.190 --> 25:25.625
Morning.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.126
( groans )

25:27.159 --> 25:28.160
What's the matter?

25:28.194 --> 25:29.295
I'm not used to waking up

25:29.328 --> 25:30.897
this close
to a man's face, Jeffrey.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.632
We got to get out of here.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.133
Lane took off.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.902
Where did he go?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.204
Last night we fought.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.672
Over you.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.041
Really don't like the way
that sounds, Jeffrey.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.744
He wanted to get rid of you.

25:44.777 --> 25:45.812
I wouldn't let him.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.346
Oh, now that sounds good.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.982
You've been decent to me.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.584
Not a lot of people have.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.552
Where did he go?

25:54.687 --> 25:56.055
I'm going to lay
it out for you.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.624
All right.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.893
I'm about to make
a lot of money.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.696
But I need a partner.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.964
Talk to me.

26:04.997 --> 26:07.266
Lane and me stole some stuff.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.335
Very valuable stuff.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.203
I kind of figured that.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.772
What is it, drugs?

26:12.805 --> 26:14.707
Stuff from Iraq.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.943
Like from
a hundred thousand years ago.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.211
There were no people then,
Jeffrey.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.212
Whatever. It's old.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.982
We got it off this Navy
base we were working at.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.952
What's it worth?

26:25.985 --> 26:27.754
Three million.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.622
You're kidding.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.290
We got a buyer--
this guy from Japan.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.626
The stuff's going to be
on a ship to Tokyo tonight.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.994
So when do you get the money?

26:35.027 --> 26:36.295
Eight hours.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.330
Okay.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.833
Lane took off to sell it
out from under you, didn't he?

26:40.867 --> 26:42.769
We got to get to those
buyers before he does.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.704
Where's the stuff?

26:44.737 --> 26:46.038
Someplace safe.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.774
You with me?

26:48.808 --> 26:50.309
( sighs )

26:52.344 --> 26:56.615
I can't face Lane alone.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.091
I'm with you.

27:14.701 --> 27:15.868
Let's break the pattern.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.069
What pattern?

27:17.103 --> 27:19.972
"Dishonest silence"
pattern.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.140
I'll start.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.010
I'm worried for Tony.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.912
There. I said it.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.415
I dropped my guard
for two seconds,

27:29.448 --> 27:32.151
I got it out,
now I'm happy.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.753
That made you happy?

27:33.786 --> 27:34.220
Yes.

27:35.922 --> 27:39.025
Don't you want
to be happy, Gibbs?

27:39.058 --> 27:40.426
I am happy.

27:40.459 --> 27:41.427
You don't look happy.
( phone rings )

27:41.460 --> 27:42.461
We're done with this.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.063
I thought we were.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.097
Yeah, McGee?

27:45.131 --> 27:46.365
Switch to car feed.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.770
Boss, I got the list of numbers
dialed from the pay phone.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.438
One was placed to a hunting
cabin outside

27:52.471 --> 27:53.773
of Richmond.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.307
It was the only phone call

27:55.341 --> 27:57.309
made from that pay phone
all afternoon.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.179
I'm feeding you
the GPS coordinates now.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.116
( tires screeching )

28:06.953 --> 28:08.721
How soon can you get the plane?

28:08.755 --> 28:11.123
Well, I know a guy
that can arrange
a charter

28:11.157 --> 28:12.925
to Key West.
From there, we can get

28:12.959 --> 28:14.260
a King Air 350
twin engine.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.863
That'll get us to Mexico.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.267
JEFFREY:
I'm glad Lane took off.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.241
We're gonna make a good team.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.311
Better get going.

28:37.984 --> 28:39.952
Lane took the bike.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.754
He must've pushed it
down the road.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.455
He didn't want us to wake up

28:43.489 --> 28:45.091
when he started it.

28:52.999 --> 28:57.269
My father used to have
a cabin like this.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.971
He used to bring me
and my sister here.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.774
Good times?

29:01.808 --> 29:03.976
Used to beat the crap out of me.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.377
Your parents
are supposed

29:05.411 --> 29:07.379
to help you, Tony,

29:07.413 --> 29:09.481
not hurt you.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.450
Your father hurt you?

29:11.483 --> 29:14.854
No, he was too drunk
to hurt anyone.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.289
I hate it here.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.327
Then let's get out of here,

29:21.360 --> 29:22.328
make us some money.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.563
Hell, yeah.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.899
Let's go make us lots of money.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.767
( engine starting )

29:41.380 --> 29:42.414
Either I speak to Agent Gibbs

29:42.448 --> 29:44.851
and get a full accounting
of this investigation

29:44.884 --> 29:47.286
or I've been authorized
to pull NCIS

29:47.319 --> 29:49.188
from the investigation

29:49.221 --> 29:50.556
and put it under
the FBI's jurisdiction.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.024
You're getting in the way.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.827
Excuse me, Agent McGee.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.528
We are working
very hard.

29:56.562 --> 29:59.198
We have an undercover agent
who is missing.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.001
He's risking his life,
and your constant interruptions

30:02.034 --> 30:03.369
are keeping me
from doing my job.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.504
You lost
your prisoners.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.874
You lost your agent.

30:07.907 --> 30:08.841
That is not true.

30:08.875 --> 30:09.876
That's what
you told me.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.010
Look, the truth is,

30:11.043 --> 30:12.511
that while Agent DiNozzo
is lost,

30:12.544 --> 30:14.413
Jeffrey White
is still with him,

30:14.446 --> 30:16.282
so Jeffrey White,
technically,

30:16.315 --> 30:17.349
is with an NCIS agent

30:17.383 --> 30:20.052
and therefore, technically,
is still in custody.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.153
Well,
you've clearly

30:21.187 --> 30:22.855
been empowered to tell me off.

30:22.889 --> 30:23.923
Yes, ma'am.

30:23.956 --> 30:24.790
And what exactly

30:24.823 --> 30:26.558
did Agent Gibbs tell you
to say to me?

30:26.592 --> 30:30.062
He told me to tell you to...

30:30.096 --> 30:31.597
stick it.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.067
You're telling me

30:35.101 --> 30:36.102
to...

30:36.135 --> 30:36.936
Stick it.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.172
Thank you, Ms. Deputy
Secretary of State.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.540
Our conversation is now over.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.181
( scattered applause )

31:37.997 --> 31:39.365
Clear.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.906
Clear.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.476
We're too late.

31:50.509 --> 31:51.910
Search it.

31:52.644 --> 31:55.514
( phone ringing )

31:57.216 --> 31:58.650
Yeah? Gibbs.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.156
Special Agent McGee speaking.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.692
Hey, McGee.
Yes, boss.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.694
Run the phone records
for the land line at the cabin.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.362
On it.
Oh, and, uh,

32:10.396 --> 32:12.064
boss, I told her...

32:12.098 --> 32:13.966
the Deputy Secretary of State.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.168
Yeah? How'd it work?

32:16.202 --> 32:19.138
Well, she submitted a formal
complaint to the Director.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.973
McGee...

32:21.007 --> 32:22.474
good job.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.482
KATE:
Gibbs!

32:56.542 --> 32:57.976
Over here.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.427
Throat's slashed
to the spine.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.030
Lane Harrison didn't kill
those two guys in Seattle.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.531
Jeffrey White did it.

33:19.565 --> 33:22.034
Tony has no idea
who he's with, Gibbs.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.781
DUCKY:
Wasn't much of a struggle.

33:35.814 --> 33:38.417
Only these abrasions
on his cheek.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.821
The head was grabbed from
behind and immobilized,

33:42.854 --> 33:43.755
and with the other hand...

33:43.789 --> 33:45.324
...came around
and cut across the throat.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.393
( camera shutter clicks )

33:47.426 --> 33:49.228
From the look of things,

33:49.261 --> 33:52.631
he was experienced in this
method of execution, Jethro.

33:52.664 --> 33:56.202
We think he's responsible for
three other murders, same M.O.

33:56.235 --> 33:58.737
And Tony's with the bastard?

33:58.770 --> 33:59.771
Is he aware?

33:59.805 --> 34:00.672
Probably not.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.473
But we have to think

34:01.507 --> 34:03.775
Tony didn't know
anything about this.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.377
He would've never
allowed it to happen.

34:05.411 --> 34:06.578
Unless...

34:09.148 --> 34:12.684
We checked the rest of the area.
No other bodies.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.622
Tony's still alive.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.334
"Lynchburg
across from Wal-Mart."

34:28.367 --> 34:29.668
( phone ringing )
Mean anything?

34:29.701 --> 34:31.270
Yeah. Gibbs.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.472
( hangs up )

34:33.505 --> 34:36.142
( phone rings )

34:37.676 --> 34:39.511
I do not have a VW.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.247
Still getting the calls,
huh, boss?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.080
What do you got, McGee?

34:42.114 --> 34:43.449
Well, I got
the local message units

34:43.482 --> 34:45.517
dialed from the cabin.
Nothing there.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.418
Long distance?

34:46.452 --> 34:48.354
The exchange has mechanical
switches,

34:48.387 --> 34:49.121
so it's going
to take some time.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.356
They may be headed
to Lynchburg

34:50.389 --> 34:51.557
to make the sale.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.558
I need the location

34:52.591 --> 34:53.825
of all Wal-Marts in the area.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.361
Fast.
On it.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.736
What are we doing?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.605
We're pulling over.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.706
But we don't want Lane
showing up first--

35:07.739 --> 35:08.740
we should get
to the buyer.

35:08.774 --> 35:09.875
We got time.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.544
I'm gonna take
a little nap.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.147
You want me to drive
while you sleep?

35:15.181 --> 35:17.883
You think we ought
to keep moving?

35:17.916 --> 35:18.817
I do.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.289
You got my back, Tony?

35:23.322 --> 35:24.456
You know it.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.431
You know...

35:36.202 --> 35:39.438
...I feel like I've been
running my whole life...

35:42.741 --> 35:45.577
...just to get
to this moment.

35:45.611 --> 35:48.647
Finally doing
something right.

35:57.623 --> 35:58.857
Found the Wal-Mart.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.327
There's a storage facility
across the street,

36:01.360 --> 36:03.229
with Conex boxes
in the parking lot.

36:03.262 --> 36:03.962
Call the local LEOs.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.797
Make sure they understand

36:05.831 --> 36:07.433
there's a federal agent
working undercover.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.634
You got it.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.629
Nothing in the Conex boxes.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.898
What about the long distance
records on the cabin?

36:39.931 --> 36:40.799
Working on it, boss.

36:40.832 --> 36:41.867
Work faster.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.673
It was a misdirect.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.907
He knew that we would
search the body.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.276
What do we do?

36:50.309 --> 36:52.611
( phone rings )

36:52.644 --> 36:54.212
Yeah. Gibbs.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.848
God...

37:03.289 --> 37:04.256
God...

37:04.290 --> 37:05.257
( dialing )

37:05.291 --> 37:05.991
( phone rings )

37:06.024 --> 37:07.293
McGee.

37:07.326 --> 37:07.959
Hey! McGee!

37:07.993 --> 37:08.894
Listen up...

37:08.927 --> 37:10.996
Boss, it's only been,
like, ten seconds.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.931
I'm know I'm good,
but I'm not that good.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.533
I just had a hang-up.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.503
Check the last incoming call
on my cell

37:17.536 --> 37:20.038
and have Abby
run a GPS location.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.673
This isn't about the VW, is it?

37:21.707 --> 37:22.641
No!

37:22.674 --> 37:24.576
It's where DiNozzo is!

37:28.780 --> 37:30.749
ABBY:
It's Lane Harrison's cell phone.

37:30.782 --> 37:34.520
Highway 14, just past
Newport News, Virginia.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.455
Stay on the phone
and guide us there.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.857
( engine revs, Kate shrieks )

37:40.992 --> 37:41.760
ABBY:
You all right?!

37:41.793 --> 37:42.994
Gibbs is driving.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.364
I'm saying a prayer
in many languages.

37:45.397 --> 37:46.798
( tires squealing )

38:01.347 --> 38:03.048
How we doing?

38:03.081 --> 38:05.617
You scared the
hell out of me.

38:05.651 --> 38:08.554
That's part of my charm.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.427
( phone rings )

38:17.763 --> 38:19.498
Tony.
Tony.

38:20.366 --> 38:22.434
He's coming down 14th,

38:22.468 --> 38:24.736
headed for the west side.

38:24.770 --> 38:25.771
Take a right.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.410
( ringing )

38:31.443 --> 38:33.879
What the hell's that?

38:33.912 --> 38:36.348
It's in my bag.
I thought I turned it off.

38:36.382 --> 38:40.352
( ringing continues )

38:40.386 --> 38:42.488
Battery's dead.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.022
Well, turn it off.
They can trace a cell phone.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.091
( phone beeps )
Off.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.659
I lost the signal!

38:56.167 --> 39:00.906
930685-7.
That's her.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.909
History of the world in a box.

39:03.942 --> 39:04.943
I don't see Lane.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.514
I've always wanted
to scuba dive.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.049
I'm gonna scuba dive.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.851
What do you think
of that?

39:12.884 --> 39:14.786
Well, you can't swim, Jeffrey.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.755
There's that, yeah.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.562
You can teach me.

39:34.039 --> 39:34.840
That's him.

39:44.583 --> 39:47.719
Now, you're gonna
watch my back.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.955
I'm gonna go
get the cash...

39:53.559 --> 39:55.060
...and then we're
gonna get out of here.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.062
You ready?

39:57.095 --> 39:58.664
I want you to listen
to me, Jeffrey.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.131
Okay.

40:00.165 --> 40:02.100
I'm a federal agent.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.169
( laughing )

40:04.202 --> 40:07.839
Good one, Tony.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.141
Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.679
Don't say that.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.146
Wish I didn't have to.

40:17.849 --> 40:20.051
Need the long distance numbers
from the cabin, McGee!

40:23.221 --> 40:24.656
Working on them!

40:25.724 --> 40:29.127
Never lost an agent
undercover, Kate.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.030
I am not about to let DiNozzo
screw that up.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.206
Everyone's gonna know
you wanted to turn yourself in.

40:41.239 --> 40:42.340
That you drove me here
voluntarily.

40:42.373 --> 40:45.844
You testify against Lane,
they're gonna cut you a deal.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.514
W-W-What do I do?

40:48.547 --> 40:49.715
Okay, you sit tight.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.583
I'll arrest the buyer,
then we call my boss

40:51.617 --> 40:52.250
and he'll pick us up.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.485
Okay.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.258
One call:
Dr. Haru Owagawa.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.128
Ph.D. in Art History at GW.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.796
It's gotta be the buyer.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.132
We need a GPS location
on his cell.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.671
12 blocks from
your location,

41:12.704 --> 41:14.205
head due west.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.808
( tires squealing )

41:16.842 --> 41:19.511
I know you don't have
any backup, Tony.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.046
How do you know that, Jeffrey?

41:21.079 --> 41:24.015
I thought
you might be a cop.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.951
That's why we took that

41:25.984 --> 41:27.786
swim in the stream,

41:27.819 --> 41:30.656
and that's why
I crashed the truck.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.023
No bugs.

41:33.692 --> 41:36.061
There's a reason Lane
isn't here, isn't there?

41:39.097 --> 41:42.568
You're having
naughty thoughts, Tony.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.740
Just so you know...

41:50.609 --> 41:53.244
...when I said

41:53.278 --> 41:56.181
no one ever treated me

41:56.214 --> 41:58.216
like you did...

41:59.918 --> 42:01.252
I meant that.

42:02.754 --> 42:03.955
I know.

42:06.257 --> 42:09.160
( tires screeching )

42:11.129 --> 42:12.097
Step away
from your car!

42:12.130 --> 42:13.565
Hands in the air!

42:42.728 --> 42:45.063
I really liked him.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.699
Yeah...

42:47.733 --> 42:49.267
yeah, I can see that.
