02:14.720 --> 02:19.061
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

02:23.274 --> 02:24.827
<i>Two years ago,</i>

02:24.951 --> 02:27.836
<i>there were only three people
working in our African branch.</i>

02:27.960 --> 02:31.081
<i>Because of the war here,
they didn't get a single order.</i>

02:31.089 --> 02:33.883
<i>Two of Ruan Ling's bosses
left, one after the other.</i>

02:33.907 --> 02:40.017
<i>Actually, they escaped,
leaving her high and dry.</i>

02:41.001 --> 02:44.222
<i>But, surprisingly, the war
ended earlier this year.</i>

02:44.246 --> 02:48.351
<i>The most chaotic country in
Africa is rebuilding itself,</i>

02:48.375 --> 02:51.144
<i>and the development of
mobile telecommunications</i>

02:51.168 --> 02:52.978
<i>became the government's top priority.</i>

02:53.002 --> 02:54.688
<i>Because our company
was short staffed,</i>

02:54.712 --> 02:58.690
<i>it encouraged the R and D team
to go into the field and sell.</i>

02:58.714 --> 03:02.735
<i>I was getting bored
doing IT work,</i>

03:02.759 --> 03:06.154
<i>so I volunteered to
work with Ruan Ling.</i>

03:06.178 --> 03:10.851
<i>My only regret is dropping
the enhancement programme.</i>

03:11.681 --> 03:13.520
<i>Well, just let it go.</i>

03:15.559 --> 03:17.065
China salesman.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.491
Yan Jian.

03:34.697 --> 03:36.784
DH TELECOM

04:00.714 --> 04:03.431
That's good.
Show him the guns.

04:14.598 --> 04:16.567
Thank you.
<i>Friendship.</i>

04:27.191 --> 04:31.033
Susanna.
I have a spare car you can use.

04:32.193 --> 04:33.285
Thank you, Michael.

04:36.238 --> 04:40.910
But you know, there are
certain lines we'd better not cross.

04:42.242 --> 04:43.629
Okay.

04:44.661 --> 04:46.795
I take it back.

04:55.459 --> 05:00.438
Hey. Can we ask the company
for satellite phone service?

05:00.462 --> 05:03.815
We can if we win the bidding.

05:03.839 --> 05:07.734
By then, we'll have internet.
There'll be no need for a satellite phone.

05:07.758 --> 05:10.855
A necessity. It helps to kill time.

05:12.887 --> 05:15.073
Come on, what era are we in?

05:15.097 --> 05:18.242
Let's divide and conquer.
The proposal.

05:18.266 --> 05:20.994
Technical parameter settings and
frequency demonstrations are yours.

05:21.018 --> 05:25.205
I'll take care of customs clearance
and deal with the government officials.

05:25.229 --> 05:28.666
I've gone through
the bidding regulations.

05:28.690 --> 05:30.990
It doesn't look good for us.

05:45.826 --> 05:48.428
Ah, my friend, Mr Carlos!

05:48.452 --> 05:50.208
Asaid.

05:51.747 --> 05:55.684
Kabbah, this is what I've found
about the Mengtulu Kingdom,

05:55.708 --> 05:58.769
from the largest
libraries in the world.

05:58.793 --> 06:02.730
Although your ancestors
lost their country 200 years ago,

06:02.754 --> 06:05.190
and nearly became extinct,

06:05.214 --> 06:10.651
the Mengtulu warriors galloped
across Africa 2,000 years ago,

06:10.675 --> 06:14.306
leaving a glorious page in history.

06:19.765 --> 06:21.734
Thank you.

06:30.647 --> 06:33.166
Our people are not extinct!

06:33.190 --> 06:35.168
We're now spread all over Africa.

06:35.192 --> 06:38.628
For sure, I can recover our nation.

06:38.652 --> 06:40.088
But I need your help.

06:40.112 --> 06:42.631
I've been here for two years,

06:42.655 --> 06:44.925
trying to win an order
for the company.

06:44.949 --> 06:48.177
But who would have thought
the Big Four from Europe and America

06:48.201 --> 06:51.378
would suddenly jump in, not
giving a damn about this company?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.138
It's not the first time.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.474
The new government of this
country, under pressure,

06:55.498 --> 06:57.516
set up a committee
for the telecoms bidding.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.351
They hired Susanna
to be in charge of the bidding.

07:01.459 --> 07:05.855
That French woman doesn't
take us seriously at all.

07:05.879 --> 07:09.774
She believes that only the Europeans
and the Americans are good at tech.

07:09.798 --> 07:14.138
We are just court jesters,
entertaining the prince.

07:15.594 --> 07:17.238
She's French?
Yep.

07:17.262 --> 07:19.239
That's obviously not fair to us.

07:19.263 --> 07:22.200
She's an expert from the
International Telecommunication Union,

07:22.224 --> 07:24.275
sent over to help African countries.

07:28.019 --> 07:29.663
Uh...

07:29.687 --> 07:31.705
Welcome back to my country.

07:31.729 --> 07:35.625
Let me tell you, the sunshine,
the brightness, the sand, everything...

07:35.649 --> 07:37.126
Prince Mengtulu.

07:37.150 --> 07:40.826
Where there is a dream, there is a future.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.047
Hi, Michael, how are you?
Good, good, good.

07:45.071 --> 07:47.299
This is Kabbah.

07:47.323 --> 07:48.581
On the house, gentlemen.

07:49.284 --> 07:50.919
Thanks.
I don't drink.

07:52.827 --> 07:53.928
All right.

07:53.952 --> 07:59.599
Men of the Mengtulu Kingdom used to
be warriors who could hold their drinks,

07:59.623 --> 08:03.268
and the alcohol prohibition
is forced on you by this country.

08:03.292 --> 08:05.012
I do not drink.

08:08.546 --> 08:12.685
The rule here is that you
can't leave until you drink.

08:12.798 --> 08:14.734
Why?

08:14.758 --> 08:18.779
He's worried that you will report him
to authorities for selling alcohol.

08:18.803 --> 08:22.562
Well, I will not report him,
but I will stick to my faith!

08:25.849 --> 08:27.059
Hm.

08:36.398 --> 08:39.114
No alcohol? Then drink this.

08:45.946 --> 08:49.966
I must say, I appreciate the offer,
my friend, but a rule's a rule.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.960
I do not drink!

08:56.578 --> 08:58.180
What's that? What's going on?

09:38.314 --> 09:39.737
Yaah!

09:56.117 --> 09:57.956
Carlos.

09:58.077 --> 10:01.089
Forgive my people. You see?

10:04.664 --> 10:07.101
How you doing, sweetheart?
Everything good? Happy?

10:07.125 --> 10:08.963
You all right?

10:10.794 --> 10:13.723
You're a bunch of arseholes.
Get the fuck out of here, all of you.

11:32.307 --> 11:34.441
You served me pee! You die!

11:35.767 --> 11:38.353
Kabbah. Let's go.

11:42.897 --> 11:44.735
Motherfucker, you drink piss!

11:48.692 --> 11:52.203
You'll have to sign here. Just there.

11:55.447 --> 11:57.831
Director Omar.
Hello, Miss Ruan.

11:59.533 --> 12:01.122
This is my new colleague, Yan Jian.

12:01.909 --> 12:03.499
How are you, Yan Jian?

12:04.912 --> 12:07.014
How are you, Director Omar?

12:07.038 --> 12:09.307
We called this special meeting

12:09.331 --> 12:11.934
to get your feedback
on the bidding requirements.

12:11.958 --> 12:13.685
We'd like to have an open discussion.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.472
As long as your requests are reasonable,

12:17.670 --> 12:21.346
we'll make changes in accordance
with international practices.

12:24.132 --> 12:28.444
As you all know, CDMA and GSM
are the two main standards nowadays

12:28.468 --> 12:31.185
in the wireless telecommunications world.

12:31.304 --> 12:34.324
However, according to the bidding rules,

12:34.348 --> 12:37.576
only CDMA standard is accepted.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.911
This is obviously unfair.

12:39.935 --> 12:43.371
Competition is the foundation
of all business principles.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.665
Even though, being a European company,

12:45.689 --> 12:50.408
we agree on entering the bidding
using the CDMA standard.

12:50.983 --> 12:55.004
With the rapid development
of wireless telecommunications,

12:55.028 --> 12:58.423
new products come out every
18 months to replace the old.

12:58.447 --> 13:00.747
The competition is ruthless.

13:01.282 --> 13:03.051
Susanna?

13:03.075 --> 13:07.137
Are you determined to put DH
Telecom at a disadvantage?

13:07.161 --> 13:12.057
To the extent you want to get rid
of our relay tower receivers

13:12.081 --> 13:15.309
as an initial investment!

13:20.670 --> 13:22.472
Uh...

13:24.798 --> 13:26.387
I totally...

13:27.466 --> 13:31.261
agree with Miss Susanna's principle
in the standard selection.

13:32.470 --> 13:35.814
As Susanna is the expert from ITU,

13:35.930 --> 13:37.616
she'd have heard the latest news.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.576
Ten days ago, ITU released a report

13:40.600 --> 13:44.858
predicting that 3G digital
communications will take over the world.

13:46.062 --> 13:49.165
3G standard is the upgraded system,

13:49.189 --> 13:52.126
combining the strengths
of CDMA and GSM.

13:52.150 --> 13:54.085
Based on this,

13:54.109 --> 13:59.172
wireless communication will be
upgraded into 4G, 5G, 6G, or maybe...

13:59.196 --> 14:02.133
Are you... Are you suggesting
3G as the standard?

14:02.157 --> 14:05.169
Yes! Exactly.

14:05.826 --> 14:09.137
Yesterday, LK Telecom Group in Europe

14:09.161 --> 14:11.212
opened a three billion euro bid,

14:11.871 --> 14:13.875
and set 3G as the standard.

14:14.498 --> 14:19.185
As Susanna wants this bid to be
in sync with the latest technology,

14:19.209 --> 14:22.969
I suggest we change the standard to 3G.

14:23.629 --> 14:27.222
But I'm not sure about the product's
stability and its completeness.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.984
Hm.

14:30.008 --> 14:32.937
So, ah... what do you all think?

14:35.178 --> 14:38.142
No problem, it's perfect for us.

14:38.805 --> 14:40.408
Now it is settled.

14:40.432 --> 14:43.148
The standard of the bidding is 3G.

14:45.268 --> 14:48.037
The time of the bidding remains the same.

14:48.061 --> 14:51.489
At eight am on July 31st.

14:54.274 --> 14:56.793
Yan Jian, you're amazing!

14:56.817 --> 14:58.461
You might not have known that

14:58.485 --> 15:00.837
our company has made
a few 3G units for testing.

15:00.861 --> 15:03.993
Headquarters is preparing
to bid on the LK project in Europe.

15:04.865 --> 15:07.259
We can take advantage of that.

15:07.283 --> 15:09.635
Should be okay for us to get use of one.

15:09.659 --> 15:13.263
So, it's just us against MTM.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.133
With Director Omar on our side,
we're sure to win!

15:21.292 --> 15:23.311
Michael.

15:23.335 --> 15:26.021
How can you make a decision
on this without consulting us first?

15:26.045 --> 15:29.058
We had a deal.
You're just playing along.

15:30.465 --> 15:33.359
Of course, I can make the decision.
You son of a bitch!

15:33.383 --> 15:36.237
You're nothing but a liar.
You just made a fool of us in there.

15:36.261 --> 15:40.448
In case you haven't noticed,
you're no match for that Chinese guy.

15:40.472 --> 15:43.188
D.H. HEADQUARTERS, BEIJING

15:43.474 --> 15:45.034
<i>We've just finalized the 3G model.</i>

15:45.058 --> 15:47.369
Full production won't begin
for another month.

15:47.393 --> 15:50.996
There's no way
we can send it to you next week.

15:51.020 --> 15:53.915
Miss Zhao, it is possible.

15:53.939 --> 15:56.441
You'd better do as you're
told, and that's it!

15:59.400 --> 16:00.961
Those guys!

16:00.985 --> 16:03.546
They just sit on their fat
asses and boss us around!

16:03.570 --> 16:05.673
We are a technology company.

16:05.697 --> 16:08.257
Nobody makes a profit by selling leftovers.

16:08.281 --> 16:10.286
What a shame!

16:10.909 --> 16:13.790
Yan Jian, you're incredible.

16:14.911 --> 16:18.124
You kicked out three European
companies in one shot.

16:19.498 --> 16:22.794
And now, one day later,
we're also out of the picture.

16:34.591 --> 16:37.611
<i>I found out last night
from my contacts at headquarters</i>

16:37.635 --> 16:40.647
<i>we actually don't have
any equipment for the bidding.</i>

16:48.142 --> 16:49.612
Hi, Michael.

16:50.184 --> 16:51.738
Hello, beautiful.

16:53.103 --> 16:54.747
<i>Ruan Ling.</i>

16:54.771 --> 16:58.833
<i>I'll go and talk to Omar and Susanna
and tell them I was bullshitting.</i>

16:58.857 --> 17:03.660
<i>I'll beg them to change the standard back.
If it has to be CDMA, we'll accept it.</i>

17:10.115 --> 17:12.884
Sir, are you looking for Mr Omar?

17:12.907 --> 17:14.219
Yes.

17:14.242 --> 17:17.919
He has gone south with the president.
He won't be back for a few days.

17:22.164 --> 17:24.299
That Chinese guy
is in over his head.

17:25.415 --> 17:27.752
Don't get upset with him.

17:30.128 --> 17:32.981
He's not worth it.

17:33.005 --> 17:34.974
I'm not upset with him.

17:36.132 --> 17:38.930
I... I just can't figure him out.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.346
D.H. EUROPEAN OFFICE, GENEVA

17:41.511 --> 17:46.906
You must be kidding.
GSM is good enough for where you are.

17:46.930 --> 17:49.867
Sir, the meeting is about to begin.
Hey, I've got a meeting. Later.

17:49.891 --> 17:52.368
Listen...

17:52.392 --> 17:55.829
What if I tell you I can help
to shorten our 3G connection time,

17:55.853 --> 17:57.063
by one and a half seconds?

17:58.355 --> 17:59.778
<i>Can we talk'?</i>

18:02.399 --> 18:04.169
What? Say that again?

18:04.193 --> 18:07.546
<i>I threw together an enhancement
programme, and it's almost done.</i>

18:07.570 --> 18:13.167
I can send it to you. This will make us
at least a second faster than MTM.

18:13.906 --> 18:16.492
In return, you have to give me
one set of your 3G equipment.

18:17.201 --> 18:18.411
Encrypt it, and send it to me.

18:26.624 --> 18:29.352
Hey, Ruan Ling, how are you?

18:29.376 --> 18:32.812
Lauder, just leave me alone.

18:32.836 --> 18:34.556
Good idea.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.094
Yes, Yes, yes!

19:20.118 --> 19:21.873
Whoa!

19:26.330 --> 19:28.558
What's the test result?

19:28.582 --> 19:31.428
Who wrote this? It's fantastic!

19:44.258 --> 19:46.278
Hello?
Yan Jian.

19:46.302 --> 19:49.446
The result is excellent!
It's 1.51 seconds faster!

19:49.470 --> 19:51.532
<i>We reported it to the board.</i>

19:51.556 --> 19:53.074
They've decided to promote you,

19:53.098 --> 19:54.992
as either the deputy head
of the tech department

19:55.016 --> 19:58.327
or the head of the tech sector
in the European division.

19:58.351 --> 19:59.662
But what about here?

19:59.686 --> 20:01.163
Let's call it a tactical retreat.

20:01.187 --> 20:02.823
Give it up? I can't do it.

20:03.813 --> 20:05.865
Go to another phone.

20:14.988 --> 20:16.589
Hello.

20:16.613 --> 20:17.841
We were bugged?

20:17.865 --> 20:20.050
<i>Fm not sure. Just a gut feeling.</i>

20:20.074 --> 20:23.261
This is the company's top secret
that we're talking about here.

20:23.285 --> 20:25.304
We can never be too
careful in this business.

20:25.328 --> 20:27.167
<i>We can't afford any more losses.</i>

20:27.913 --> 20:30.515
What did you just say you couldn't do?

20:30.539 --> 20:34.310
I said I wanted to stay here.
You've got to honour our agreement.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.338
<i>But I can't.</i>

20:38.545 --> 20:40.051
Hey, Michael.

20:40.171 --> 20:43.607
This is the jammer you wanted.

20:43.631 --> 20:48.110
And best of all, it is
absolutely untraceable.

20:48.134 --> 20:50.020
Good job.

21:04.562 --> 21:06.915
Your package arrived!

21:06.939 --> 21:11.030
<i>Your package arrived!
Zheng Ming is the man!</i>

21:14.026 --> 21:15.837
Here are the facts.

21:15.861 --> 21:18.631
<i>We've got only three
certified 3G host machines.</i>

21:18.655 --> 21:20.257
DH TELECOM MACHINE

21:20.281 --> 21:23.384
<i>One in Europe, one in North
America, and one is in the lab</i>

21:23.408 --> 21:25.052
<i>of the Chinese Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology.</i>

21:25.076 --> 21:28.179
Full production
won't start for another month.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.089
Then give me yours, the one in Europe!

21:30.204 --> 21:34.100
You must be kidding!
I'm serious! Send me the equipment!

21:34.124 --> 21:36.976
How soon can you give me the report?
In three days.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.270
We can do 10,000 stability tests
in three days.

21:39.294 --> 21:42.507
If everything goes well,
we can get approval for installation.

21:43.547 --> 21:48.610
<i>In three days, I need my equipment
to run the integration tests for LK.</i>

21:48.634 --> 21:51.611
There's no way I can give it to you.
I don't care.

21:51.635 --> 21:53.655
I want that contract.

21:53.679 --> 22:00.284
But I do have a prototype here,
used for the ITU standard test.

22:00.308 --> 22:01.910
<i>I want it. Ship it.</i>

22:01.934 --> 22:03.440
<i>You can have it.</i>

22:05.394 --> 22:07.788
But it's not certified.

22:07.812 --> 22:09.366
That's it!

22:10.314 --> 22:12.568
CERTIFICATE DH TELECOM

22:22.864 --> 22:24.091
Boss.

22:24.115 --> 22:26.036
How are you, sweetheart?
Great.

22:28.076 --> 22:29.961
Little busy right now.
Okay.

22:31.161 --> 22:33.181
Yeah?
We've learned that

22:33.205 --> 22:35.458
DH has a new enhancement programme.

22:36.415 --> 22:39.925
They can beat MTM by one
second in connecting time.

22:40.042 --> 22:43.139
So what do you want from me?
Name your price.

22:43.669 --> 22:44.927
Get the programme.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.924
All right, consider it done.

22:53.843 --> 22:57.768
Whoever needs to initiate
the relay tower system

22:58.555 --> 23:00.856
will need my fingerprint for access.

23:07.644 --> 23:10.122
We're done for today.
Already?

23:10.146 --> 23:12.197
Yep. See you tomorrow.

23:14.524 --> 23:17.710
Do you know why
DH developed so fast?

23:17.734 --> 23:20.337
Because everybody in the
company works so hard,

23:20.361 --> 23:22.380
and they don't mind to work overtime.

23:22.404 --> 23:27.384
Listen, if I were you,
I would just focus on the bidding.

23:27.408 --> 23:30.621
Besides, not everyone
wants to do overtime.

23:39.290 --> 23:41.093
Okay, you can go ahead.

24:30.450 --> 24:33.302
Susanna, your fingerprint.

24:33.326 --> 24:36.596
Susanna, your fingerprint.

24:44.708 --> 24:48.271
Susanna? Can you hear me?

24:48.295 --> 24:49.681
Where are you?

25:00.511 --> 25:03.642
Stop it! Stop it!
Why do you want to kill her? Let me go!

25:06.515 --> 25:08.409
Susanna, what's going on?

25:08.433 --> 25:10.869
What's going on?
Let me go! Save the little girl.

25:10.893 --> 25:12.995
They want to sacrifice her!
Don't cry.

25:13.019 --> 25:15.831
Let me go, stop!

25:15.855 --> 25:17.665
What are you doing?
Go!

25:17.689 --> 25:21.417
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Get in the car!

25:21.441 --> 25:23.586
Here!
Get in the car!

25:23.610 --> 25:26.170
Go, go, 90, go! Go, go!
My daughter!

25:26.194 --> 25:28.531
Go, go, go, don't worry about me!

25:31.323 --> 25:33.244
Go, go, go!

25:37.995 --> 25:39.721
Let's go!

25:39.745 --> 25:41.806
Get her!

25:41.830 --> 25:44.182
Go left! Left, left!

25:44.206 --> 25:47.136
Left! Left! Go!

26:30.696 --> 26:33.966
They have taken away my daughter!

26:33.990 --> 26:38.469
This man must be punished!
You barbarians!

26:38.493 --> 26:41.429
Why do you harm a child?
Kill him! Kill him!

26:41.453 --> 26:44.640
Why do you harm a child? Pull me down!

26:44.664 --> 26:47.166
Kill him! Kill him!
I didn't want to hurt the child!

26:50.333 --> 26:54.521
Save the girl, please, save the girl!
I need help here!

26:54.545 --> 26:57.190
Girl, please!
Come here, come in!

26:57.214 --> 26:58.733
Hurry, help her.

26:58.757 --> 27:00.595
She's bleeding.

27:10.180 --> 27:12.102
Lady, don't worry.

27:13.015 --> 27:15.702
It's an injury caused by an excision,
she'll be all right.

27:15.726 --> 27:18.193
What? Incision?

27:33.279 --> 27:34.869
Didi, are you fine?

27:35.614 --> 27:38.117
Daddy's here.

27:48.373 --> 27:50.517
Let the Chinese man go!

27:50.541 --> 27:52.643
If you have to punish someone, punish me.

27:55.669 --> 27:58.105
Sheik Asaid. Didi, she is okay.

27:58.129 --> 27:59.689
They meant no harm.

27:59.713 --> 28:02.595
Is that lady there?
Put her on the phone.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.053
I'm Asaid, Sheik of Uhdan tribe.

28:07.677 --> 28:10.614
We have different
religions and customs.

28:10.638 --> 28:12.938
Though we misunderstood each other,

28:13.681 --> 28:16.450
I would like to thank
you for your kindness.

28:16.474 --> 28:19.369
How is Mr Yan Jian?
The Chinese gentlemen?

28:19.393 --> 28:21.370
He is fine.

28:21.394 --> 28:23.455
He will be back tomorrow.

28:23.479 --> 28:25.068
Don't worry.

28:28.983 --> 28:30.835
You survived?

28:30.859 --> 28:34.129
Just when I got back to the office,
I got a call from Asaid,

28:34.153 --> 28:35.955
asking me to pick you up right away.

28:37.114 --> 28:39.995
How is Susanna?

28:40.949 --> 28:42.385
And the little girl?

28:42.409 --> 28:44.594
The little girl is already home.

28:44.618 --> 28:47.880
I called Susanna and she
was worried about you.

28:47.995 --> 28:50.676
You seem to be worried about her as well.

28:52.039 --> 28:53.767
Nonsense!

28:53.791 --> 28:57.551
I have no idea what happened yesterday.

29:00.046 --> 29:03.524
<i>In Africa, Uhdan warriors have
been renowned as fearless fighters</i>

29:03.548 --> 29:05.775
<i>who could outdrink anyone.</i>

29:05.799 --> 29:08.902
Drinking is a ritual of being a warrior.

29:08.926 --> 29:11.279
It is also an act of regret.

29:11.303 --> 29:13.781
<i>Last night, you drank a
whole jar in one go.</i>

29:13.805 --> 29:16.900
<i>It was enough for them
to let you off the hook.</i>

29:17.849 --> 29:20.493
What are these? Huh?

29:20.517 --> 29:24.537
Special gifts from Sheik Asaid.
Uhdan speciality.

29:24.561 --> 29:26.623
Date wine.

29:50.912 --> 29:52.056
Mr Duchamps.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.766
Don't worry, the police have been paid off.

29:54.790 --> 29:56.100
Okay.

29:56.124 --> 29:59.560
What DH is doing is unethical,

29:59.584 --> 30:02.170
and goes against
basic business principle.

30:03.545 --> 30:07.859
There are standard guidelines,
but it's not written down.

30:07.883 --> 30:12.028
However, no matter what,
you can't be seen to favour the Chinese.

30:12.052 --> 30:13.987
They ought to be disqualified!

30:14.011 --> 30:19.282
Susanna, I don't play favoritism
when our national interest is at stake.

30:19.306 --> 30:20.950
But this is business.

30:20.974 --> 30:25.482
Without competition, it's impossible
to get the best product for the best price.

30:26.144 --> 30:28.694
Er... Let's forget about these pictures.

30:30.231 --> 30:33.942
Hello, I want to buy some goat's milk.
Okay.

30:48.617 --> 30:51.804
No doubt, having
five world renowned companies

30:51.828 --> 30:54.597
for the mobile telecom bidding here today

30:54.621 --> 30:59.559
is not only a sign of affirmation as well
as hope for the future of this country

30:59.583 --> 31:02.185
that has just endured
suffering and hardship,

31:02.209 --> 31:04.187
but it's also an honour.

31:04.211 --> 31:09.024
Whoever wins here today, I want to thank
you all from the bottom of my heart,

31:09.048 --> 31:12.276
on behalf of this country and its people.

31:12.300 --> 31:17.055
However, only two companies have been
selected for the next and final phase.

31:17.678 --> 31:20.865
The last two companies that are
entering the final phase are...

31:20.889 --> 31:22.561
MTM Telecom...

31:24.766 --> 31:26.901
and DH Telecom.

31:39.318 --> 31:43.588
Now, please turn on your sewer,
please turn on your host machine,

31:43.612 --> 31:49.384
and set the frequency
from 1880-1920 megahertz.

31:49.408 --> 31:54.330
And set the number to 88669977.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.806
But now, let's see
what this China salesman

31:57.830 --> 31:59.467
will have for us for the main course.

32:08.629 --> 32:12.775
Miss Susanna, while yes,
I'm a China salesman,

32:12.799 --> 32:15.693
why don't you call me Mr Yan or Yan Jian?

32:15.717 --> 32:18.403
You have my name in front of you.

32:18.427 --> 32:21.280
That's the least
that you can do to show respect.

32:21.304 --> 32:24.157
We're at a global
mobile telecom bidding, here,

32:24.181 --> 32:26.316
and only technology matters.

32:27.058 --> 32:29.702
Please, don't mistake this
as a class for etiquette.

32:29.726 --> 32:32.871
Whoever wins the bidding, wins respect.

32:32.895 --> 32:36.748
Why are you so sure that we can't win?

32:36.772 --> 32:40.698
You'll see, I will make you call me Mr Yan.

32:43.694 --> 32:47.454
Now, DH. Start the test.

32:55.535 --> 32:58.915
Mr Elephant. Is your nose itchy again?

33:00.872 --> 33:05.101
Miss Cobra, I just sneezed.

33:12.213 --> 33:14.983
There has to be a jammer nearby.

33:34.437 --> 33:37.116
<i>Kabbah, Togar was murdered.
Bring your guys over, right now.</i>

33:51.489 --> 33:55.960
Mr Elephant,
is your nose itchy again?

33:56.785 --> 33:59.667
Miss Cobra, I just sneezed.

34:00.412 --> 34:05.808
Don't worry, my dear.
I will send you the remedy right away.

34:05.832 --> 34:08.465
Thank you, I'm feeling much better.

34:16.422 --> 34:22.027
Miss Susanna. In addition to the given
frequencies, we also have a backup.

34:22.051 --> 34:24.435
No one can jam this.

34:27.347 --> 34:29.532
Sorry for the interruption. Spot check!

34:29.556 --> 34:31.608
Who's Yan Jian?

34:34.518 --> 34:36.954
Yan Jian, you have violated
the laws of our country,

34:36.978 --> 34:39.871
and are hereby under arrest
for drinking and hiding alcohol.

34:39.896 --> 34:43.166
This is not alcohol, it's...
it's goat's milk!

34:43.190 --> 34:45.752
Goat's milk? Get him up.
Goat's milk!

34:45.775 --> 34:49.212
I was set up. Trust me!
Let's go. Let's go.

34:49.235 --> 34:54.371
I said I did not put alcohol in there!
I said I was set up. Trust me!

35:13.960 --> 35:15.171
Go!

36:12.332 --> 36:14.811
The capital is in chaos.

36:14.835 --> 36:16.886
The civil war is unavoidable.

36:17.878 --> 36:21.139
This is Andy Nelson,
reporting live from the capital.

36:24.883 --> 36:29.195
The new leader of the South,
Vice-President Togar, was killed.

36:29.219 --> 36:32.656
Yeah, the Balour government
murdered him.

36:32.680 --> 36:36.325
And we must avenge him, blood for blood!

36:36.349 --> 36:39.410
Do you have proof?
Shut up, you fool!

36:39.434 --> 36:40.608
You shut up!

36:47.065 --> 36:48.903
You wanna die?

36:56.112 --> 36:59.173
Mr Duchamps,
is the news you got reliable?

36:59.197 --> 37:02.384
Yesterday afternoon,
Togar flew from Uganda in a helicopter.

37:02.408 --> 37:06.845
The helicopter crashed on Mount
Aboutogou, and Togar died in the crash.

37:06.869 --> 37:10.514
Togar wasn't killed
in the helicopter by Balour?

37:10.538 --> 37:15.434
The war between the North and the South
is inevitable. This is your chance!

37:15.458 --> 37:19.478
You will not only restore a tribe,
but also build a new country.

37:19.502 --> 37:21.271
People are sick and tired of war.

37:21.295 --> 37:23.440
They're more willing
to sit down and talk now.

37:23.464 --> 37:26.150
Once the country's communication
collapses,

37:26.174 --> 37:28.234
and no one can talk to each other,

37:28.258 --> 37:32.196
then the door of our success
will be wide open.

37:32.220 --> 37:33.856
Michael.

37:35.055 --> 37:36.098
It's okay, it's okay.

37:37.973 --> 37:41.535
Michael. You can't
make Kabbah do this!

37:41.559 --> 37:43.494
You know how much
money is at stake!

37:43.518 --> 37:46.288
Why are you doing this?

37:46.312 --> 37:49.707
Philip, you are too shortsighted.

37:49.731 --> 37:53.043
How much money can you make
from a telecom contract?

37:53.067 --> 37:57.754
This country has rich oil
and rare mineral reserves.

37:57.778 --> 38:01.620
But the Chinese are ahead of us,
exploiting them.

38:02.406 --> 38:06.927
Moreover, there is money
to be made from arms sales.

38:06.951 --> 38:11.346
One missile is worth all
the equipment here.

38:13.872 --> 38:18.226
But, no matter what,
you can't start another war!

38:18.250 --> 38:21.179
Philip, this is not my personal decision.

38:21.294 --> 38:26.725
But we need to renegotiate how
this country's resources are distributed.

38:27.548 --> 38:29.942
Who are you working for, besides MTM?

38:29.966 --> 38:33.144
I have many identities. I have a mission.

38:35.178 --> 38:37.182
You're despicable.

38:38.889 --> 38:41.575
MTM doesn't need any warmongers.

38:41.599 --> 38:45.560
I'll expose you.
I will tell everyone the truth.

38:59.777 --> 39:00.963
No!

39:02.863 --> 39:05.132
President Balour just received

39:05.156 --> 39:07.884
an emergency call
from the president of Uganda.

39:07.908 --> 39:10.177
Uganda has lost contact
with the helicopter

39:10.201 --> 39:14.806
of Vice President Togar,
at 6:30 pm on July 30th.

39:14.830 --> 39:18.766
The armies of several nations
have now launched a search

39:18.790 --> 39:21.935
in the area where the
helicopter might have crashed.

39:21.959 --> 39:25.228
The local UN personnel
have also joined the search.

39:25.252 --> 39:27.814
Kabbah. The curtain is up.

39:27.838 --> 39:33.901
In 15 minutes, all the sat phones in this
country will be blocked except ours.

39:33.925 --> 39:38.100
This is new frequency.
Only you and I know it. Remember this.

39:38.803 --> 39:42.032
I call you but you never call me.

39:42.056 --> 39:43.491
We can confirm that...

39:57.482 --> 39:59.285
Destroy them all.

40:10.324 --> 40:13.586
SOUTH MILITARY HQ, NIUSETE

40:21.457 --> 40:24.505
Now, let's show respect to our leader.

40:25.084 --> 40:28.013
We must avenge Togar!

40:43.263 --> 40:46.908
Mr Omar! Director
WOMAN: Director Omar!

40:49.851 --> 40:51.661
This is Isam.

40:51.685 --> 40:54.163
The captain of Presidential Guards.

40:54.187 --> 40:59.291
The leaders of the South are in the middle
of an emergency meeting in Niusete.

40:59.315 --> 41:01.486
At nine am tomorrow,

41:02.526 --> 41:06.046
they will inform President Balour
of their decision by telephone.

41:06.070 --> 41:09.340
The call will be recorded
and broadcast worldwide.

41:09.364 --> 41:13.134
But the entire
telecommunication network is down.

41:13.158 --> 41:15.511
No phone lines can get through.

41:15.535 --> 41:19.305
As of now,
even the satellite lines are gone.

41:19.329 --> 41:23.891
The president has ordered
Isam and I to have the line restored

41:23.915 --> 41:26.434
between the North and the South ASAP.

41:26.458 --> 41:29.061
Director Omar, why can't
they just send a telegram?

41:29.085 --> 41:33.648
No, the people of the media need
to hear the voices of the two leaders.

41:33.672 --> 41:36.969
Director Omar,
let's check out the sewer first.

41:39.009 --> 41:41.095
My God, Michael!

41:43.262 --> 41:44.947
Are you okay?

41:44.971 --> 41:47.240
They killed Philip.
What?

41:47.264 --> 41:48.557
What?
What?

41:49.474 --> 41:52.160
Isam. Isam.

41:52.184 --> 41:53.577
This is Balour.

41:53.601 --> 41:55.454
What is the situation?

41:55.478 --> 41:58.247
Very bad. All servers are damaged.

41:58.271 --> 42:02.375
The wires are broken in many places,
and all the phone lines are down.

42:02.399 --> 42:07.237
Do everything you can to restore
the network before nine am tomorrow.

42:18.869 --> 42:22.096
Director Omar, can we pull our experts?
They're all here.

42:22.120 --> 42:24.265
Communications...

42:24.289 --> 42:27.100
We can't stay here!
I wanna stay here and help...

42:27.124 --> 42:29.226
Those who are willing to help,
please, stay.

42:29.250 --> 42:32.354
Otherwise,
we will escort you to a safe area.

42:32.378 --> 42:35.758
Okay, let's go! Quickly!
You save countries.

42:36.755 --> 42:41.109
This is an emergency, so please,
everyone, work out a plan.

42:41.133 --> 42:43.402
How many soldiers do you have?

42:43.426 --> 42:46.905
Can you stop the shooting outside?
Otherwise...

42:46.929 --> 42:48.980
Maybe... Er...

42:49.931 --> 42:53.228
Maybe there is another solution,
regardless of the gunfire.

42:53.350 --> 42:55.651
Who are you?
A China salesman.

42:56.226 --> 42:59.747
China salesman?
What is he doing in handcuffs?

42:59.771 --> 43:04.076
We... We could connect
the wireless with landline.

43:05.566 --> 43:09.212
Use switch technology control units.

43:09.236 --> 43:11.820
It might be able to work,
even with damaged wires.

43:12.946 --> 43:14.452
Brilliant.

43:24.245 --> 43:25.556
It's all down.

43:41.381 --> 43:43.516
Keep this one for now.

43:50.095 --> 43:52.147
It doesn't work.

43:55.599 --> 43:57.271
This is an emergency.

44:10.151 --> 44:12.129
Hello?
Kabbah.

44:12.153 --> 44:16.340
Knock out all three relay towers
at the North-South border.

44:16.364 --> 44:18.414
Especially the one in the Abeynee.

44:28.580 --> 44:30.584
You can make the call now.

44:38.253 --> 44:40.230
Hello?
Hello, Fatima.

44:40.254 --> 44:41.856
Isam?

44:41.880 --> 44:45.058
Please inform the president
that everything goes well here.

44:53.137 --> 44:55.532
It's not getting to the South.

44:55.556 --> 44:57.939
It's not going through to the South?

45:01.060 --> 45:03.704
No need to call, let's
just fight with them.

45:03.728 --> 45:05.956
General, it must be Balour, for sure.

45:05.980 --> 45:09.740
But we must figure out the cause
for General Togar's death.

45:16.653 --> 45:20.116
It must be the three towers
at the North-South border.

45:21.740 --> 45:23.718
We're getting no signals from there.

45:23.742 --> 45:26.458
Those receivers might be damaged.

45:26.577 --> 45:29.387
Can you fix it, Mr Salesman?

45:29.411 --> 45:31.348
I need someone to go with me.

45:31.372 --> 45:35.048
I can't activate the receivers
without her fingerprint ID.

45:37.459 --> 45:41.021
I'll go. I'm happy
to do what I can for this country.

45:41.045 --> 45:43.105
You don't have to say anything.

45:43.129 --> 45:46.066
Whatever you did wrong,
I will get you a presidential pardon.

45:46.090 --> 45:50.402
I promise.
It was only milk in the bag.

45:50.426 --> 45:52.975
I need no pardon.

45:57.430 --> 45:59.103
I have only one request.

46:00.265 --> 46:01.659
Under these circumstances,

46:01.683 --> 46:04.161
I hope you would consider
cancelling today's bidding

46:04.185 --> 46:05.870
and holding it in a month's time.

46:05.894 --> 46:08.706
Hm?
I'll tell the president.

46:08.730 --> 46:13.084
According to today's test,
DH made one mistake after another.

46:13.108 --> 46:15.835
You're out! MTM is gonna win the bid.

46:15.859 --> 46:19.046
You won't get the order,
even if you repair the telephone lines.

46:19.070 --> 46:22.631
What are you talking about?
The bidding is still not finished.

46:22.655 --> 46:25.217
But you've already made up your mind?

46:25.241 --> 46:27.843
This is unfair!
It's more than fair!

46:27.867 --> 46:31.430
How can DH compete with MTM?
Your technology is way behind.

46:31.454 --> 46:33.872
You're such an opportunist.

46:35.248 --> 46:37.558
I'd rather give DH another chance.

46:37.582 --> 46:41.727
I can fix the problems at the
tower myself. I don't need another person.

46:41.751 --> 46:44.897
What do I need you for?
If not for your fingerprint?

46:44.921 --> 46:46.723
Susanna, Yan Jian.

46:46.838 --> 46:48.594
The people need you right now.

46:49.299 --> 46:51.818
More will die with every second of delay.

46:51.842 --> 46:54.361
Listen to the gunshots and screams.

46:54.385 --> 46:57.682
Can you please
put your differences aside? Hm?

47:01.682 --> 47:04.701
We can confirm now
that, due to low visibility,

47:04.725 --> 47:08.287
a helicopter crashed
into the Amatuogu mountain range.

47:08.311 --> 47:12.164
On board the Uganda presidential
aircraft were Dr John Togar,

47:12.188 --> 47:15.500
his six colleagues,
and seven crew members.

47:15.524 --> 47:17.543
They all died in the crash.

47:17.567 --> 47:19.753
The Southern People's
Liberation Movement

47:19.777 --> 47:22.540
is holding an emergency meeting
in Niusete.

47:27.782 --> 47:30.009
You lost the moral ground

47:30.033 --> 47:33.304
when you took advantage of the
loopholes in the bidding regulations.

47:33.328 --> 47:36.764
You and your company still want to be
a respectable player in the business?

47:36.788 --> 47:38.840
Hah. Keep dreaming.

47:39.998 --> 47:44.436
Being the person in charge
and getting involved with a client,

47:44.460 --> 47:47.674
who really is on the shaky moral ground?

47:50.923 --> 47:52.180
Fire!

47:57.969 --> 47:59.356
Go, go!

48:07.600 --> 48:09.154
Move back! Back!

48:15.647 --> 48:18.115
Watch out! You have to watch out!

48:32.159 --> 48:33.332
Fire.

48:47.835 --> 48:51.927
Sir, a large number of reinforcement
troops are approaching us.

48:55.674 --> 48:56.859
We're pulling out.

48:56.883 --> 48:59.219
We're moving to the third tower.

49:19.148 --> 49:20.750
Captain!

49:20.774 --> 49:22.709
Seems like you've been in a battle, sir!

49:22.733 --> 49:25.153
Do you know the enemy?
I have no idea.

49:25.277 --> 49:27.910
We have to repair the... this relay tower.

49:31.698 --> 49:35.260
I need you to stay here
and to protect this tower.

49:35.284 --> 49:38.248
Okay, sir.
Be careful.

49:54.463 --> 49:57.191
Hello?

49:57.215 --> 50:00.735
Director Omar, the first relay
tower has been activated.

50:00.759 --> 50:03.392
We're heading to the second one.
Very good.

50:05.179 --> 50:08.357
General, we still can't get hold
of the president's office.

50:09.723 --> 50:11.618
Everybody, pay attention.

50:11.642 --> 50:13.869
We are crossing the Southern border.

50:13.893 --> 50:17.913
If anything happens, do not fire back.

50:17.937 --> 50:20.866
Copy.
Copy, copy.

50:29.945 --> 50:32.625
Sir, I hear movement.

50:36.491 --> 50:39.539
Northern troops! Take positions!
Man your guns!

50:56.683 --> 50:58.937
Let's go, let's go!

50:59.519 --> 51:01.155
Move! Move!

51:04.106 --> 51:06.027
Hold your fire!

51:07.067 --> 51:09.700
Do not fire without my command.
Yes, sir!

51:13.239 --> 51:16.885
What should we do?
We are running out of time.

51:16.909 --> 51:21.832
Even if we win the battle,
we will face their reinforcements.

51:24.249 --> 51:25.459
Wait.

51:26.376 --> 51:28.395
Perhaps...

51:28.419 --> 51:30.887
Do we have anything
with a UN symbol on it?

51:31.922 --> 51:33.892
Or a... a Red Cross flag?

51:34.800 --> 51:37.653
I think with that, we might be able
to pass the checkpoint.

51:37.677 --> 51:39.433
Yeah. It might work.

51:39.554 --> 51:43.813
Hey, guys,
find anything with a UN symbol,

51:44.350 --> 51:46.686
or anything with a Red Cross on it.

51:49.688 --> 51:51.416
I couldn't find anything.

51:51.440 --> 51:53.859
We didn't find anything, sir.
Go!

52:06.578 --> 52:08.630
I got this.

52:08.747 --> 52:10.253
Chinese flag.

52:10.999 --> 52:12.339
Chinese flag?
Yeah.

52:13.126 --> 52:14.762
Are you suggesting we're gonna use it?

52:16.420 --> 52:18.010
I doubt it can work.

52:18.130 --> 52:19.774
Impossible.

52:19.798 --> 52:23.361
Maybe.
Maybe.

52:23.385 --> 52:26.018
Captain! Captain! Map!

52:38.982 --> 52:41.318
Stop! Stop!

52:42.443 --> 52:45.456
Hey! What are you doing?

52:45.988 --> 52:47.716
Stop it!

52:47.740 --> 52:48.867
Hey, stop it!

52:54.245 --> 52:55.207
No!

53:06.965 --> 53:08.353
Hey! No!

53:33.363 --> 53:34.407
Fire!

53:57.677 --> 53:59.682
Hold fire!

54:31.332 --> 54:32.423
Captain.

54:33.167 --> 54:35.634
Get the pickup. Pickup!

54:36.628 --> 54:38.384
Go, go, go! Quick, quick, quick!

54:41.632 --> 54:43.652
Go!

54:43.676 --> 54:46.321
Remove your hats.
Hide your ribbons.

54:46.345 --> 54:48.823
Don't make a move without my command.
Yes, sir!

54:48.847 --> 54:50.733
Yan Jian! Get on the truck!

54:54.519 --> 54:56.820
Don't worry about it. Slowly.

55:04.277 --> 55:06.080
Come on.

55:59.869 --> 56:01.471
China! How are you?

56:01.495 --> 56:02.931
How are you? How are you?

56:02.955 --> 56:07.296
How are you?
Good, brothers!

56:34.941 --> 56:37.622
Yes.
Director Omar...

56:37.735 --> 56:39.963
we are heading to the third tower.

56:39.987 --> 56:41.328
Terrific.

56:45.451 --> 56:47.470
Yan Jian.

56:47.494 --> 56:49.297
Thank you.

57:01.757 --> 57:03.609
There is the third tower.

57:03.633 --> 57:06.481
We can restore the connection
in an hour from now.

57:09.222 --> 57:12.367
Susanna, what happened?
The tower just got blown up!

57:12.391 --> 57:14.286
How bad is it?
The tower is completely gone!

57:14.310 --> 57:16.329
Susanna!
Susanna!

57:16.353 --> 57:17.622
Hello? Ugh!

57:17.646 --> 57:19.318
Hello? Ugh!

57:20.315 --> 57:23.794
This is the only tower
between the North and the South,

57:23.818 --> 57:25.787
and no other options!

57:30.574 --> 57:32.635
Everybody out! Go search!

57:32.659 --> 57:32.790
Everybody out! Go search!

57:38.331 --> 57:41.184
All clear, all clear.
Okay, continue, continue.

57:41.208 --> 57:43.130
Copy, copy.

57:44.753 --> 57:47.148
Excuse me, ladies.
Can I please talk to you?

57:47.172 --> 57:47.815
Excuse me, ladies.
Can I please talk to you?

57:47.839 --> 57:50.804
Did you see what happened here?

57:52.468 --> 57:55.600
Is this your goat?
Madam? Excuse me?

58:02.602 --> 58:04.524
Go, go, go, go!

58:40.303 --> 58:43.067
Move forward, move forward!
Annihilate them, now!

59:32.391 --> 59:35.828
Get in the car! Susanna!
Come on, come on.

59:39.939 --> 59:41.742
Hold on!

59:44.985 --> 59:45.253
Hurry, hurry!

59:45.277 --> 59:46.867
Hurry, hurry!

01:00:25.479 --> 01:00:29.157
Get out! Get out of here!
Run, run, run, run, run! Run, run!

01:00:31.985 --> 01:00:33.705
This way, this way, this...

01:00:34.988 --> 01:00:36.494
Go, go, go, go!

01:00:37.573 --> 01:00:38.926
Go, go, go'.

01:00:50.251 --> 01:00:51.674
Get away from me, you bastard!

01:00:54.297 --> 01:00:55.969
Get away! Let me go!

01:01:38.377 --> 01:01:40.313
Yan Jian! Susanna!

01:01:40.337 --> 01:01:42.058
Where are you?

01:01:42.172 --> 01:01:43.441
Yan Jian. Susanna.

01:01:43.465 --> 01:01:45.185
Yan Jian. Susanna.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.445
Where are you?

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:49.655
Captain. It's hopeless.

01:01:49.679 --> 01:01:51.323
It's impossible.

01:01:51.347 --> 01:01:54.117
Impossible.
Yan Jian!

01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:56.494
I know you can do it!

01:01:56.518 --> 01:01:57.954
You are our only hope!

01:01:57.978 --> 01:01:58.856
You are our only hope!

01:01:59.771 --> 01:02:03.167
Captain... it's impossible.

01:02:03.191 --> 01:02:05.336
It's over.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.588
It's over! Over!

01:02:07.612 --> 01:02:11.091
Yan Jian!
Come out'. You must come out!

01:02:11.115 --> 01:02:12.967
We still have hope...
as long as you keep trying!

01:02:12.991 --> 01:02:14.510
We still have hope...
as long as you keep trying!

01:02:14.534 --> 01:02:17.263
Yan Jian! Yan Jian!

01:02:17.287 --> 01:02:18.544
Yan Jian!

01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:23.632
Yan Jian!

01:02:50.608 --> 01:02:52.494
Go, go! Run him over! Go!

01:03:01.826 --> 01:03:04.013
Omar, any news from Isam?

01:03:04.037 --> 01:03:05.889
No, Mr President.

01:03:05.913 --> 01:03:07.965
We still can't get hold of him.

01:03:17.173 --> 01:03:18.929
Sir, we have to stop!
Sandstorm is coming!

01:03:22.511 --> 01:03:24.232
Shit!

01:03:30.143 --> 01:03:33.607
General, it seems like
the sandstorm won't stop soon.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:36.911
It's impossible to fix the landline
in this kind of situation.

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:40.451
Prepare for the battle!
Yes, General!

01:03:41.653 --> 01:03:46.676
There are many reports of cars
burning, looting, rape and murder

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.594
in the capital and around the country.

01:03:48.618 --> 01:03:52.165
Many are killed.
Civil war seems unavoidable.

01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:02.257
Thank you for saving my life.

01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:08.236
Yan Jian, stop blaming yourself
for Isam's death.

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.447
Okay, let's stay focused.

01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:10.572
We have to get lines reconnected.

01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:12.186
We have to get lines reconnected.

01:04:12.973 --> 01:04:14.826
The relay tower is destroyed.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.855
It's simply not possible.

01:04:17.852 --> 01:04:20.735
You must find a way.
I know you can!

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:25.585
It's impossible to
restore the landline.

01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:27.128
It's impossible to
restore the landline.

01:04:27.152 --> 01:04:30.047
We already have three divisions
up in the front.

01:04:30.071 --> 01:04:33.551
We can take over
one third of the southern land.

01:04:33.575 --> 01:04:36.386
Susanna, there is
a tower at Uhdan tribe.

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:38.629
How far is Uhdan tribe from Niusete?

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:40.098
80 kilometres.

01:04:40.122 --> 01:04:40.932
80 kilometres.

01:04:40.956 --> 01:04:44.894
The maximum transmission distance
between the two towers is 60 kilometres.

01:04:44.918 --> 01:04:48.631
There's an extra 20 kilometres to cover.
It's impossible.

01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:52.518
How long do you think
this sandstorm will last?

01:04:53.426 --> 01:04:54.683
It may stop before daybreak.

01:04:59.014 --> 01:05:01.158
There is a possibility that...

01:05:01.182 --> 01:05:06.900
the sandstorm may cause an unusual
disturbance in the ionosphere.

01:05:07.688 --> 01:05:09.624
This may increase
the transmission distance of the signals

01:05:09.648 --> 01:05:10.959
This may increase
the transmission distance of the signals

01:05:10.983 --> 01:05:13.830
to make up the 20 kilometres difference.

01:05:14.694 --> 01:05:16.464
But maybe not.

01:05:16.488 --> 01:05:18.549
The signals may be on and off.

01:05:18.573 --> 01:05:20.791
It's all in the hands of God.

01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:24.638
In the hands of God, indeed.

01:05:24.662 --> 01:05:25.805
In the hands of God, indeed.

01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:28.308
Hello. Can anybody hear me?

01:05:28.332 --> 01:05:30.017
This is Yan Jian.

01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:32.019
We have found a solution.

01:05:32.043 --> 01:05:34.104
Let's meet at the Uhdan tribe.

01:05:34.128 --> 01:05:36.429
Hello? Hello?

01:05:38.716 --> 01:05:39.150
Susanna, I have something to ask you.

01:05:39.174 --> 01:05:42.779
Susanna, I have something to ask you.

01:05:42.803 --> 01:05:46.397
If we release the source code,
will you give the contract to us?

01:05:48.057 --> 01:05:51.995
What are you saying?
The source code is the core of a telecom.

01:05:52.019 --> 01:05:53.277
I'm sure they won't do it.

01:05:55.105 --> 01:05:56.446
What if I can do it?

01:05:59.317 --> 01:06:01.128
Wait till the war is over.

01:06:01.152 --> 01:06:04.173
I'll do all I can to
convince DH to do this.

01:06:04.197 --> 01:06:07.126
I'm sure we can do it.

01:06:08.701 --> 01:06:12.876
Though your idea is really annoying,
I have to say, it's great.

01:06:15.623 --> 01:06:19.716
General, here is a satellite photo
of the plane crash site.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.481
Obviously, it got hit by a missile.

01:06:23.505 --> 01:06:23.690
Only Western countries
have this kind of missile.

01:06:23.714 --> 01:06:26.985
Only Western countries
have this kind of missile.

01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:29.393
So, it may not be the Northern army.

01:06:52.406 --> 01:06:53.216
Sheik Asaid!
We must protect this tower.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.010
Sheik Asaid!
We must protect this tower.

01:06:56.034 --> 01:06:59.347
Otherwise, the civil war
might break out again.

01:06:59.371 --> 01:07:00.890
Please, it's our only hope.

01:07:00.914 --> 01:07:02.808
I heard the news about Togar.

01:07:02.832 --> 01:07:05.602
I can't use my sat phone right now.

01:07:05.626 --> 01:07:07.729
Someone does not want peace
in this country.

01:07:07.753 --> 01:07:08.230
Someone does not want peace
in this country.

01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:10.273
You go ahead!

01:07:10.297 --> 01:07:12.551
I'll take care of those guys.
Thank you.

01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:26.663
Hey. Take this.

01:07:26.687 --> 01:07:28.323
Lucky charm.

01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:34.627
Stop! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:08:39.292 --> 01:08:40.728
Please don't die!

01:08:40.752 --> 01:08:43.606
One more shot, and we will kill you all!

01:08:51.095 --> 01:08:53.238
We have nothing to do
with Togar's death.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:54.948
We are running out of time.

01:08:54.973 --> 01:08:57.060
Let us to send our troops.

01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:04.652
Sir, the helicopter is coming towards us!

01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:09.766
We are UN peacekeepers.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:11.960
We can't get involved in the war.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:14.963
What else can we do for you?

01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:44.630
Sir, please fly south
for 20 kilometres.

01:10:44.654 --> 01:10:48.091
Trust me, our chopper will
soon become the tower that you need.

01:10:48.115 --> 01:10:50.093
Thank you.

01:10:50.117 --> 01:10:52.429
Mr President, reconsider it.

01:10:52.453 --> 01:10:55.133
Many innocent people will die.

01:11:16.432 --> 01:11:19.066
Connect the North and South, now!

01:11:20.978 --> 01:11:24.940
Mr President, please give the command.
We are running out of time.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:29.871
Connected, connected! Connected!

01:11:35.115 --> 01:11:36.705
Hello?

01:11:38.577 --> 01:11:40.878
Mr President, call from South.

01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:49.688
President Balour, we now know
the truth about the tragedy.

01:11:49.712 --> 01:11:52.857
We will abide by the peace agreement.

01:11:52.881 --> 01:11:58.737
Let's work together,
act with reason and restraint.

01:11:58.761 --> 01:12:02.991
We will stop any attempts against peace.

01:12:03.015 --> 01:12:08.037
We have to protect
what we have achieved so far.

01:12:09.521 --> 01:12:11.624
Cool.

01:12:11.648 --> 01:12:18.380
Mr Kir, again,
your decision has saved our country.

01:12:18.404 --> 01:12:20.076
Thank you.

01:12:22.449 --> 01:12:24.635
Yes!

01:12:24.659 --> 01:12:27.847
We did it!
Fantastic!

01:12:27.871 --> 01:12:29.342
Peace!

01:12:30.123 --> 01:12:32.142
Peace!

01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:34.519
Wow! Peace!

01:12:34.543 --> 01:12:36.880
We made it!
Yeah!

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:48.990
We will abide by the peace agreement.

01:12:49.014 --> 01:12:54.151
Let's work together,
act with reason and restraint.

01:12:55.103 --> 01:12:58.624
We will stop any attempts against peace.

01:13:11.242 --> 01:13:13.793
Stop! Who are you?

01:13:24.421 --> 01:13:25.974
Stop!

01:13:26.798 --> 01:13:29.485
Stop! Stop!

01:13:29.509 --> 01:13:32.612
Sheik Asaid, we got the guy
who blew up the relay tower.

01:13:32.636 --> 01:13:34.531
Stop! Let him go!

01:13:34.555 --> 01:13:36.991
Sheik Asaid, he has killed
so many innocent people!

01:13:37.015 --> 01:13:39.702
Why set him free?
The war is over!

01:13:39.726 --> 01:13:43.238
We should stop killing ourselves
and let go of the hatred!

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:53.589
My son, some say the Great Rift Valley
is a beautiful scar on the face of Africa.

01:13:53.613 --> 01:13:55.250
Others say...

01:13:56.324 --> 01:13:58.411
she is the most tender vein of Africa.

01:13:59.369 --> 01:14:01.263
Let it go.

01:14:01.287 --> 01:14:03.873
You will find peace wherever you may be.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.314
Within 24 hours of the
restoration of peace process,

01:14:12.338 --> 01:14:16.479
this courageous China Salesman

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:19.988
has demonstrated impeccably

01:14:20.012 --> 01:14:24.325
the superiority of DH's technology
and products.

01:14:24.349 --> 01:14:28.370
He completed the bidding process
with grace under fire.

01:14:28.394 --> 01:14:31.573
I announce, therefore, the winner is...

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.951
China DH Telecom!

01:14:44.409 --> 01:14:45.619
Wait!

01:14:46.369 --> 01:14:47.763
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:14:47.787 --> 01:14:49.806
I'm Tony Harwell.

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:52.225
I'm MTM Telecom's attorney.

01:14:52.249 --> 01:14:56.687
My client has filed a lawsuit
against DH Telecom

01:14:56.711 --> 01:15:01.302
for intellectual property infringement
and fraudulent business practices.

01:15:02.341 --> 01:15:06.351
My friends of the media,
the evidence is right in front of you.

01:15:06.929 --> 01:15:08.573
Follow me, please.

01:15:08.597 --> 01:15:11.033
Michael! You're such a liar!

01:15:11.057 --> 01:15:14.703
Director Omar and Susanna
are my witnesses.

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:16.580
They can prove it.
MTM.

01:15:16.604 --> 01:15:18.774
What are you doing, Michael?

01:15:22.025 --> 01:15:23.961
MTM.

01:15:23.985 --> 01:15:26.213
The facts are clear.

01:15:26.237 --> 01:15:31.551
DH doesn't have the required
3G wireless technology and capacity.

01:15:31.575 --> 01:15:34.637
Thank you.
It seems like DH is in crisis

01:15:34.661 --> 01:15:37.056
since the lawsuit may extend worldwide.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.891
It will be a serious problem for DH...

01:15:38.915 --> 01:15:41.102
So, MTM's up to its old tricks again.

01:15:41.126 --> 01:15:42.853
We are about to begin construction.

01:15:42.877 --> 01:15:45.689
Now they want to renegotiate the contract.

01:15:45.713 --> 01:15:47.566
It puts us in a difficult position!

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:50.223
LK group informed us in writing...

01:15:51.885 --> 01:15:53.855
that we are disqualified from the bidding.

01:15:53.970 --> 01:15:56.022
MTM, what a bully.
Pushing their way around.

01:15:57.849 --> 01:16:02.024
Michael, have you got
the enhancement programme as you said?

01:16:02.978 --> 01:16:04.651
It is not here yet.

01:16:05.272 --> 01:16:07.241
Get it as soon as you can.

01:16:07.816 --> 01:16:11.659
Make sure it can cut the missile launch
by one second.

01:16:13.363 --> 01:16:15.465
General, it will be here.

01:16:15.489 --> 01:16:17.993
I promise, you will get something.

01:16:18.909 --> 01:16:23.132
Mr President, Yan was the hero
who saved the country.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:27.794
You have the power
to stop the lawsuit submitted by MTM.

01:16:28.668 --> 01:16:30.103
I can't.

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:32.439
This is politics now.

01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:37.219
We are not afraid
of any pressure from Western countries,

01:16:39.177 --> 01:16:43.115
but... we don't want
to give them any excuses

01:16:43.139 --> 01:16:47.101
to attack our government
and cause instability.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.812
I am sorry.

01:16:53.273 --> 01:16:56.168
Zheng Ming, I'm being set up.

01:16:56.192 --> 01:16:57.753
<i>It's all because of you.</i>

01:16:57.777 --> 01:17:00.494
LK already disqualified us.

01:17:01.197 --> 01:17:03.925
<i>The procedure for a test in
court is very complicated.</i>

01:17:03.949 --> 01:17:07.345
It may take six months to a year.
By then...

01:17:07.369 --> 01:17:11.390
DH Telecom may be out of business.

01:17:11.414 --> 01:17:13.016
Listen to me.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.977
<i>I worked out a proposal
for public source code.</i>

01:17:16.001 --> 01:17:17.687
If the board accepts it,

01:17:17.711 --> 01:17:20.096
we'll not only win the lawsuit...

01:17:21.256 --> 01:17:22.984
but also, we'll win a ton of orders.

01:17:23.008 --> 01:17:26.028
Yan Jian, don't be a smart arse.

01:17:26.052 --> 01:17:28.030
<i>You are fired!</i>

01:17:36.728 --> 01:17:40.124
Hi, Michael. I quit.
You can have your money back.

01:17:40.148 --> 01:17:43.335
Lauder, in your
entire professional life,

01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:44.962
this is such a small job.

01:17:44.986 --> 01:17:48.089
You ought to finish what you have started.

01:17:48.113 --> 01:17:50.758
That's your style.
No way.

01:17:50.782 --> 01:17:52.503
I know all about you.

01:17:53.326 --> 01:17:56.388
You were a mercenary in Africa for years,

01:17:56.412 --> 01:17:58.682
bootlegging, arms smuggling...

01:17:58.706 --> 01:18:01.601
Listen, man, I don't care who you are
or about your veiled threats.

01:18:01.625 --> 01:18:03.511
When I say no, it means no.

01:18:39.909 --> 01:18:41.416
Who are you?

01:19:17.276 --> 01:19:19.861
Mr Yan Jian, are you awake?

01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:23.581
Why am I here?

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.547
What happened?

01:19:33.332 --> 01:19:36.345
So... you're awake, Mr Yan Jian?

01:19:37.544 --> 01:19:39.396
Thank you for saving my life.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.107
You don't have to thank me.
It is Lauder who brought you.

01:19:42.131 --> 01:19:43.342
Lauder?

01:19:51.473 --> 01:19:54.687
Hi, Michael.
You got a lot of nerve comin' here.

01:19:55.435 --> 01:19:58.448
Lauder, you broke your own rules.

01:19:59.146 --> 01:20:01.946
You'd better cough up
the programme that you grabbed.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.628
Fuck you!

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:26.563
Mr Yan Jian, I heard that DH
has been dragged into a lawsuit by MTM

01:20:26.587 --> 01:20:29.066
and is on the verge of bankruptcy.

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:33.146
I like you, young man.
Would you like to come work for me?

01:20:36.554 --> 01:20:37.728
Mr Carlos,

01:20:38.598 --> 01:20:40.868
DH...

01:20:40.892 --> 01:20:43.572
won't go bankrupt, and I...

01:20:44.603 --> 01:20:46.026
won't leave DH.

01:20:48.023 --> 01:20:49.834
No problem.

01:20:49.858 --> 01:20:53.286
If you change your mind...
give me a call.

01:21:08.374 --> 01:21:10.519
I'm sorry, Sheik Asaid.

01:21:10.543 --> 01:21:12.521
I really couldn't do it.

01:21:12.545 --> 01:21:15.428
Mr Carlos is the head of LK...

01:21:17.674 --> 01:21:20.361
the biggest European telecom company.

01:21:20.385 --> 01:21:22.530
Few actually know who he is...

01:21:22.554 --> 01:21:24.107
and even fewer...

01:21:24.972 --> 01:21:27.060
get to meet him.

01:21:27.933 --> 01:21:29.191
Can you still drink?

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.694
Come with me.

01:21:36.608 --> 01:21:38.245
Lauder...

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.579
you make your own price.

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.452
You know...

01:21:47.034 --> 01:21:49.751
we've been friends a very long time.

01:21:52.247 --> 01:21:55.710
I trust you. Fill in your own figure.

01:22:02.506 --> 01:22:06.027
I have a business associate
I have to consult with.

01:22:09.637 --> 01:22:11.772
What are you doing? Hey!

01:22:17.894 --> 01:22:19.366
My bag!

01:22:59.014 --> 01:23:00.853
No!

01:23:01.642 --> 01:23:03.578
Sheik Asaid!

01:23:03.602 --> 01:23:05.441
Sheik Asaid! Sheik Asaid...

01:23:07.897 --> 01:23:09.625
Sheik Asaid!

01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:12.234
You can't die! You can't die!

01:23:14.069 --> 01:23:15.659
They are after you.

01:23:16.655 --> 01:23:18.541
Yan Jian, they are after you!

01:23:19.324 --> 01:23:21.510
You have to leave.

01:23:21.534 --> 01:23:23.420
You can't... You can't die!

01:23:26.622 --> 01:23:28.176
Sheik Asaid!

01:23:56.482 --> 01:23:58.736
Fuck! Fuck!

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.341
Oh, fuck!

01:24:05.365 --> 01:24:08.052
MTM is suing us in Europe.

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:11.955
We are going to be stuck
with excess inventory and lawsuits.

01:24:14.123 --> 01:24:17.602
Don't worry about DH
showing their source code to the court.

01:24:17.626 --> 01:24:20.563
They'd go bankrupt
before they could win the lawsuit.

01:24:20.587 --> 01:24:24.525
But if they make it public,
it means we will lose the lawsuit,

01:24:24.549 --> 01:24:28.558
and that could be the end of the Western
telecom industry as we know it.

01:24:30.304 --> 01:24:33.199
Yan Jian wanted
me to tell you and the board,

01:24:33.223 --> 01:24:36.744
the only way to reverse this crisis
is to go for broke.

01:24:36.768 --> 01:24:38.358
We could first release our source code...

01:24:43.691 --> 01:24:46.794
DH can do so,
to get out of the dilemma,

01:24:46.818 --> 01:24:51.549
but we are bound, because
our government is so controlling,

01:24:51.573 --> 01:24:53.884
and won't allow us to release ours.

01:24:53.908 --> 01:24:55.886
As long as we have
our source code,

01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:57.762
we still have a chance to start again.

01:24:57.786 --> 01:25:01.417
Otherwise, we will go bankrupt for sure.

01:25:04.459 --> 01:25:06.428
Hey, boss, nobody is here.

01:25:08.796 --> 01:25:13.360
Maybe DH headquarters
hasn't seen Yan Jian's proposal yet, so...

01:25:13.384 --> 01:25:14.986
<i>we need to find Yan Jian...</i>

01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:17.071
and kill him.

01:25:17.095 --> 01:25:20.642
Don't forget, we have to get
his enhancement programme.

01:25:28.856 --> 01:25:32.376
Susanna...
Yan, is it really you?

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.444
Yeah.

01:25:34.319 --> 01:25:36.573
I can't believe it's you.

01:25:37.739 --> 01:25:40.509
I have to do whatever it takes.

01:25:40.533 --> 01:25:45.787
I need to release DH 3G source code,
to show our transparency.

01:25:47.122 --> 01:25:49.091
You can do it.

01:25:53.127 --> 01:25:55.097
I know you can.

01:26:39.919 --> 01:26:41.730
Yeah?

01:26:41.754 --> 01:26:43.398
Lauder!

01:26:43.422 --> 01:26:45.925
I need your help!

01:26:59.561 --> 01:27:02.456
You son of bitch!
What are you trying to do? Kill me?

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.834
Hey!

01:27:04.858 --> 01:27:07.028
Shut up! Get back to work!

01:27:14.491 --> 01:27:17.338
Kabbah,
you are lucky to be alive.

01:27:17.994 --> 01:27:20.414
But if you stay in such a shithole,

01:27:22.123 --> 01:27:25.268
you will die... sooner or later.

01:27:25.292 --> 01:27:27.354
Come on.

01:27:27.378 --> 01:27:29.063
Let's get out of here.

01:27:29.087 --> 01:27:30.594
No!

01:27:31.673 --> 01:27:35.653
Mr Duchamps, I don't want to recover
the land of my tribe any more.

01:27:35.677 --> 01:27:37.432
I don't want it.

01:27:40.598 --> 01:27:43.397
You don't want to rebuild
your tribe through war.

01:27:44.309 --> 01:27:46.065
I understand.

01:27:46.811 --> 01:27:50.624
But I don't think you want
your people to be homeless like you.

01:27:50.648 --> 01:27:52.819
I can give you a lot of money.

01:27:53.734 --> 01:27:56.880
Enough to buy you a huge tract of land.

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:58.840
You can get them together.

01:27:58.864 --> 01:28:01.592
You can give them a home.

01:28:01.616 --> 01:28:03.337
A good life.

01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:42.670
This is the encrypted
email you sent to Zheng Ming.

01:28:42.694 --> 01:28:45.339
There is a logic bomb
in the enhancement programme.

01:28:45.363 --> 01:28:47.415
You know how to open it.

01:28:50.076 --> 01:28:52.054
What if I say no?

01:28:52.078 --> 01:28:55.957
I don't want to kill you.
I just want money.

01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:59.304
Start it now.

01:29:16.933 --> 01:29:18.938
This is not competition.

01:29:21.604 --> 01:29:23.490
This is robbery.

01:29:26.066 --> 01:29:28.378
Africa belonged to the West.

01:29:28.402 --> 01:29:30.822
We brought modern civilization here.

01:29:31.863 --> 01:29:35.161
Its present and future belongs to us.

01:29:36.409 --> 01:29:38.544
You are not welcome here...

01:29:38.661 --> 01:29:40.084
China Salesman.

01:29:41.246 --> 01:29:43.750
Is slave trade a part of your civilization?

01:29:44.958 --> 01:29:48.062
And spreading war and hunger
part of your democracy?

01:29:48.086 --> 01:29:50.147
Zheng He's fleet from China

01:29:50.171 --> 01:29:53.101
reached the shores of Africa
hundreds of years ago.

01:29:54.008 --> 01:29:56.236
They only left friendship and peace!

01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:01.183
They did not take an inch of land
or a single person as a slave!

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.531
Great speech.

01:30:09.313 --> 01:30:11.082
Kabbah,

01:30:11.106 --> 01:30:13.692
it's time for him to get some fresh air.

01:30:16.069 --> 01:30:18.839
You will be punished, Michael!

01:30:18.863 --> 01:30:20.507
You will be punished!

01:30:43.343 --> 01:30:46.906
You're helping Michael
and killing your own people!

01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:49.408
Is it for the money or something else?

01:30:49.432 --> 01:30:52.244
I'm doing this for my tribe. Jump!

01:30:52.268 --> 01:30:55.364
Your tribe? Uhdan tribe?

01:30:56.688 --> 01:30:59.041
They killed your Sheik Asaid.

01:30:59.065 --> 01:31:02.503
Sheik Asaid is dead? Who killed him?

01:31:02.527 --> 01:31:04.496
Michael did! He shot him!

01:31:09.241 --> 01:31:11.344
How stupid!
You've been fooled.

01:31:11.368 --> 01:31:14.680
I have the proof! Right here!

01:31:14.704 --> 01:31:17.717
Right here! This is his button!

01:31:24.129 --> 01:31:26.733
Kabbah, where is the Chinese guy?

01:31:26.757 --> 01:31:28.844
He jumped.

01:31:30.969 --> 01:31:32.725
Now he's gone.

01:31:37.224 --> 01:31:39.661
Kill Yan Jian?

01:31:39.685 --> 01:31:42.455
<i>We have a thousand reasons
to hunt down Yan Jian!</i>

01:31:42.479 --> 01:31:45.583
Hey, why don't
you guys speak English?

01:31:45.607 --> 01:31:49.118
They will savagely kill Yan Jian.

01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:56.676
Is he safe? Where is Yan Jian?

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.178
I know where he's headed.
You can help him.

01:31:59.202 --> 01:32:00.246
Me?

01:32:01.037 --> 01:32:02.211
Yeah.

01:32:12.255 --> 01:32:15.067
Sir, are you here to retrieve
the DH source code?

01:32:15.091 --> 01:32:16.135
Yes.

01:32:18.469 --> 01:32:22.396
I'm sorry, you're missing
authorization from the board.

01:32:26.893 --> 01:32:29.372
The authorization is en route.

01:32:29.396 --> 01:32:31.499
Can I sign for it?

01:32:31.523 --> 01:32:35.235
Susanna, this is company policy.

01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:47.680
Here is the authorization letter
from our board

01:32:47.704 --> 01:32:52.225
and the certificate of the file number
from our European office.

01:32:52.249 --> 01:32:53.886
Check that.

01:32:57.212 --> 01:32:59.893
Approved by headquarters?
How did you get it?

01:33:02.008 --> 01:33:03.645
Nice girl!

01:33:09.306 --> 01:33:13.619
By the way...
Lauder asked me to pass this to you.

01:33:13.643 --> 01:33:15.788
It's your enhancement programme.

01:33:15.812 --> 01:33:18.040
He blamed you for losing his job,

01:33:18.064 --> 01:33:20.292
and he's gone to South America for good.

01:33:20.316 --> 01:33:22.321
All right, please sign here.

01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:31.010
I have changed
the IP address on the sewer.

01:33:31.034 --> 01:33:35.542
They won't find this computer.
We set up the cloud terminal as well.

01:33:57.349 --> 01:33:59.785
This is not a covert mission.

01:33:59.809 --> 01:34:04.248
I have to personally take full
responsibility for all the consequences.

01:34:04.272 --> 01:34:05.791
Jian...
Yan Jian...

01:34:05.815 --> 01:34:08.993
You don't have to say anything.
I have made my decision.

01:34:10.777 --> 01:34:11.951
I'll write a letter...

01:34:12.946 --> 01:34:15.033
and send it out with the source code.

01:34:18.117 --> 01:34:19.873
<i>"Dear Mr Carlos and everyone,</i>

01:34:21.078 --> 01:34:24.766
<i>"internet safety is the lifeblood
of mobile telecommunication.</i>

01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:26.976
<i>"Fear of being eavesdropped
on and monitored</i>

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.930
<i>"has been a concern of all
the countries of the world.</i>

01:34:31.671 --> 01:34:35.525
<i>"Now, DH has decided to release
their source code to you,</i>

01:34:35.549 --> 01:34:38.236
<i>"and they do not want to keep
a back door for themselves,</i>

01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:41.072
<i>"nor do they intend to
keep watch on others.</i>

01:34:41.096 --> 01:34:43.741
<i>"You are welcome to examine
our software and hardware</i>

01:34:43.765 --> 01:34:45.534
<i>"using reverse engineering methods.</i>

01:34:45.558 --> 01:34:48.655
<i>"And you can show your
test result to the court.</i>

01:34:51.355 --> 01:34:54.167
<i>"History will prove that...</i>

01:34:54.191 --> 01:34:56.252
<i>"DH is transparent.</i>

01:34:56.276 --> 01:35:01.131
<i>"In the meantime, if you
support our action,</i>

01:35:01.155 --> 01:35:05.343
<i>"it will also prove that we can innovate
digital telecommunications together</i>

01:35:05.367 --> 01:35:07.337
<i>"to make history."</i>

01:35:09.454 --> 01:35:14.093
Chairman, ITU just emailed...

01:35:15.084 --> 01:35:18.188
asking us to verify if our 3G source code,
which was kept there,

01:35:18.212 --> 01:35:20.929
has been retrieved by our own employees.

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.819
They called the police
and started an investigation.

01:35:24.843 --> 01:35:26.729
It must be Yan Jian.

01:35:28.263 --> 01:35:31.810
<i>Looks like you've become the
badass I once hoped to be.</i>

01:35:37.104 --> 01:35:39.415
Sir, how can I help you?

01:35:39.439 --> 01:35:40.993
Routine check.

01:36:20.643 --> 01:36:25.289
Kabbah, don't worry. You'll get paid.

01:36:25.313 --> 01:36:28.445
Are you trying to film the explosion
as insurance?

01:36:29.234 --> 01:36:31.378
Mr Duchamps,

01:36:31.402 --> 01:36:33.672
I want to keep this as a souvenir.

01:36:33.696 --> 01:36:35.748
You know, I had a dream last night.

01:36:36.448 --> 01:36:40.344
I dreamed about the land
that my tribe is going to be living on.

01:36:40.368 --> 01:36:42.263
It's a beautiful land.

01:36:42.287 --> 01:36:45.964
That sounds like a wonderful dream.
I'm sure it will come true.

01:36:48.793 --> 01:36:50.513
Aah!

01:36:57.717 --> 01:37:01.394
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the reception.

01:37:02.221 --> 01:37:06.034
I'm no longer used
to giving speeches at big occasions.

01:37:06.058 --> 01:37:07.744
However, I'm here today

01:37:07.768 --> 01:37:11.414
because of an intelligent
and brave young man.

01:37:11.438 --> 01:37:13.490
I believe that this young man...

01:37:14.774 --> 01:37:18.837
will be the next leader
of the telecommunication revolution!

01:37:18.861 --> 01:37:20.839
Who's this young man?
Which young man?

01:37:20.863 --> 01:37:22.173
Who is he?
Who could that be?

01:37:22.197 --> 01:37:24.878
Now, I've invited him here today.

01:37:25.909 --> 01:37:29.138
I hope he won't miss this historic moment.

01:37:29.162 --> 01:37:31.390
Could it be Yan Jian?

01:37:31.414 --> 01:37:34.768
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you buy a house,

01:37:34.792 --> 01:37:36.895
but someone else held the keys,

01:37:36.919 --> 01:37:39.772
and had the power to change the keys,

01:37:39.796 --> 01:37:43.427
that would feel
more like a hotel than a home.

01:37:44.092 --> 01:37:47.321
Yet that is precisely the reality

01:37:47.345 --> 01:37:50.477
of the mobile telecommunication
world today.

01:37:51.515 --> 01:37:56.162
We build the networks,
the providers hold the source code.

01:37:56.186 --> 01:37:59.531
We have neither privacy, nor freedom.

01:38:00.648 --> 01:38:03.585
Now... on the screen,

01:38:03.609 --> 01:38:05.837
you'll see the source code

01:38:05.861 --> 01:38:08.447
of DH Telecom's 3G programme.

01:38:10.157 --> 01:38:15.376
This is the result of the hard work
of numerous engineers of DH Telecom.

01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:21.209
These are the lock and key
of our house.

01:38:22.042 --> 01:38:25.646
With the leadership
of this extraordinary young man,

01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:30.192
DH Telecom
has handed these back to us,

01:38:30.216 --> 01:38:33.229
making us the true owners of this home.

01:38:33.969 --> 01:38:36.473
Carlos, you traitor!

01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:41.604
Let's remember
this great decision!

01:38:42.727 --> 01:38:44.779
Let's remember this great day!

01:38:45.688 --> 01:38:47.527
And now...

01:38:48.482 --> 01:38:50.418
I'd like to announce the winner

01:38:50.442 --> 01:38:55.282
of the three billion euro
LK Group project...

01:38:57.866 --> 01:38:59.953
China DH Telecom!

01:39:11.461 --> 01:39:15.315
Chairman, three other
companies just requalified us.

01:39:15.339 --> 01:39:17.095
DH is saved!

01:39:18.175 --> 01:39:19.945
Congratulations, Mr Ma.

01:39:19.969 --> 01:39:23.031
Thank you!
I realise this is quite a surprise.

01:39:23.055 --> 01:39:25.324
Thank you for having faith
in this young man!

01:39:25.348 --> 01:39:26.771
Thank you!

01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:33.874
Yan Jian! It's Yan Jian!

01:39:33.898 --> 01:39:35.250
Excuse me.

01:39:35.274 --> 01:39:37.168
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:39:37.192 --> 01:39:40.122
the man of the hour has arrived!

01:39:40.237 --> 01:39:42.965
He did not let me down!

01:39:42.989 --> 01:39:45.243
He did not let us down!

01:39:46.367 --> 01:39:49.047
Let's all welcome Mr Yan Jian...

01:39:51.246 --> 01:39:54.129
the great China Salesman!

01:39:59.045 --> 01:40:02.177
Kabbah, kill them all now!

01:40:03.966 --> 01:40:06.137
These bastards don't play by the rules.

01:40:09.471 --> 01:40:10.764
Traitors!

01:40:11.848 --> 01:40:14.076
Blow them all into pieces!

01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:17.196
Very soon. Very soon.

01:40:17.895 --> 01:40:20.582
Yan Jian, I knew you'd make it.

01:40:20.606 --> 01:40:22.077
Thank you.

01:40:22.858 --> 01:40:26.914
Yan Jian, thank you.
You saved our company.

01:40:30.114 --> 01:40:32.092
I quit.

01:40:32.116 --> 01:40:34.302
I'll take it.
Okay.

01:40:34.326 --> 01:40:36.545
Let's all toast to Yan Jian.

01:40:42.792 --> 01:40:46.271
Don't move!
There's bombs all over the place.

01:40:46.295 --> 01:40:48.632
Remain calm and you shall live!

01:40:56.054 --> 01:40:57.477
Kabbah.

01:40:57.597 --> 01:40:59.533
It's enough!

01:40:59.557 --> 01:41:01.660
Are you still manipulated by Michael?

01:41:01.684 --> 01:41:03.703
Do you want more people to die?

01:41:03.727 --> 01:41:06.539
Somebody has to die! Someone has to!

01:41:06.563 --> 01:41:09.250
Take my life. You saved me.

01:41:09.274 --> 01:41:13.212
It's yours to take.
You will see who dies soon enough.

01:41:13.236 --> 01:41:15.122
No!

01:41:15.821 --> 01:41:17.924
Kabbah! Kabbah!

01:41:17.948 --> 01:41:19.384
Is this how you repay me?

01:41:19.408 --> 01:41:22.220
Is this how you repay me?
Look at me!

01:41:22.244 --> 01:41:25.014
You are a disgrace to your people.

01:41:25.038 --> 01:41:28.100
Don't forget what you are fighting for.
Don't forget that.

01:41:28.124 --> 01:41:31.561
If you kill me, you'll get nothing!

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:35.465
You'll get nothing! You'll get nothing!

01:41:43.137 --> 01:41:44.823
You stay out of this!

01:41:44.847 --> 01:41:47.826
Do you really want all these people to die?

01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:49.237
Huh?

01:41:53.813 --> 01:41:56.667
I have sinned! I am a sinner!

01:41:56.691 --> 01:41:59.753
I have sinned against the Uhdan tribe.

01:41:59.777 --> 01:42:01.912
I have sinned against Africa.

01:42:02.738 --> 01:42:05.703
I have sinned against
the ancient Mengtulu Kingdom.

01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:07.962
Brothers and sisters,

01:42:09.077 --> 01:42:13.515
let go of your dreams of recovering
the ancient kingdom.

01:42:13.539 --> 01:42:16.303
Let go of your hatred.

01:42:22.297 --> 01:42:24.183
Yes, let it go...

01:42:25.425 --> 01:42:28.687
and you will find peace
wherever you may be.

01:42:30.221 --> 01:42:32.060
Please, just let it go.

01:42:33.057 --> 01:42:34.148
Please.

01:42:35.142 --> 01:42:36.233
Kabbah.

01:42:45.276 --> 01:42:48.324
Kabbah, put the gun down.

01:42:51.323 --> 01:42:52.616
Kabbah!

01:43:00.331 --> 01:43:01.672
Kabbah...

01:43:08.672 --> 01:43:12.026
Call for ambulance. Call for ambulance.
He's down. He's down.

01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:13.936
I repeat, he's down.

01:44:23.696 --> 01:44:25.748
Sir, you are under arrest.
