06:52.063 --> 06:54.022
For ten years,
he's been home every night.

06:54.065 --> 06:56.067
It's one of the reasons
why he left the army

06:56.111 --> 06:58.069

spending time together.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.168
I mean, he's always worried

- Had he been threatened?
- I don't think so,

07:17.611 --> 07:18.612
but he was worried that

07:18.655 --> 07:20.744
powerful people
could get upset.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.137
He didn't say too much to me,

just committed murder.
