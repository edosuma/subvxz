01:01.870 --> 01:05.501
<i>Almighty God, in my hour
of need, be with me</i>

01:06.581 --> 01:10.522
<i>Let me never forget my sacred
and holy vows onto Thee</i>

01:10.898 --> 01:16.227
<i>and I should not be prey onto demons and
devils, and all the dark things of this world</i>

01:17.341 --> 01:20.315
<i>Honour me with the armor
of Thy righteousness</i>

01:20.435 --> 01:24.041
<i>Give me the sword of truth,
that I shall confound mine enemies...</i>

01:24.161 --> 01:28.588
<i>...and be onto Thee... the true knight</i>

03:09.966 --> 03:12.233
They blockade the path!

03:12.945 --> 03:14.863
This way!

03:24.378 --> 03:25.394
Guard!

03:26.160 --> 03:27.560
Fall back!

03:28.567 --> 03:30.335
COVEEER!!

03:39.723 --> 03:43.014
- Jacob, we can stop this.
- Stop now, we lose more men.

03:43.274 --> 03:45.680
There is no stopping this [...]

03:45.985 --> 03:49.243
- We can outflank them.
- There are women and children in it.

03:49.323 --> 03:51.221
- They won't be hurt.
- They WILL be hurt.

03:51.301 --> 03:52.976
We end this today!

03:55.200 --> 03:56.653
WITH ME!!

03:57.714 --> 03:58.725
- Your Highness.

03:59.149 --> 04:02.927
- With Allah's help we may still prevail.
- The time for false hope is over.

04:04.576 --> 04:07.669
There is one final request
I must beg of you, my friend.

04:12.845 --> 04:16.297
Haven't you had enough of this -
killing for hypocrite priests?

04:16.495 --> 04:20.286
- We do God's work.
- The blood we spill here is on our blades.

04:20.367 --> 04:22.553
Our souls, not God's!

04:30.026 --> 04:33.367
We don't have to do this anymore.
We can just go.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.807
- Go where?
- East.

04:35.088 --> 04:36.316
No one goes East.

04:39.497 --> 04:42.740
- Cannot be any worse than here.
- You doubt our cause?

04:43.987 --> 04:47.592
- You're not the man you once were.
- None of us are.

04:52.508 --> 04:54.805
Go there. Go East!

04:55.256 --> 04:58.819
You know, I swore an oath to your father.

04:59.019 --> 05:02.195
My father is dead, you are released
of your oath.

05:02.717 --> 05:04.720
I release you. Go!

05:11.873 --> 05:13.949
- Father.
- Papa!

05:22.873 --> 05:25.073
Hassan will escort you away from here.

05:25.493 --> 05:28.073
I will see you again... very soon.

05:28.775 --> 05:30.507
You have to be strong.

05:31.295 --> 05:33.922
You have to be strong.
For the children, for us.

05:34.521 --> 05:36.355
My love.

06:01.515 --> 06:04.004
GOD WITH US!!!

07:28.822 --> 07:30.192
Stop, this is finished.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.761
Leave.

09:14.550 --> 09:17.165
My days draw to an end, my son.

09:17.245 --> 09:21.213
- No, father!
- They do... child.

09:22.671 --> 09:24.605
That is the nature of life.

09:27.912 --> 09:30.277
<i>All that is left for me...</i>

09:30.928 --> 09:35.682
...is to ensure my Kingdom
receives the leader it deserves.

09:36.517 --> 09:38.761
Which is why I have chosen you...

09:39.548 --> 09:41.138
...to sucseed me.

09:41.649 --> 09:47.420
- Me? But... Shing?
- Your brother is a great warrior.

09:49.634 --> 09:52.756
<i>Now it's the time for peace</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:56.275
That is my request of you.

09:56.791 --> 09:59.313
Father, no one will follow me.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.506
They will...

10:01.204 --> 10:03.365
...because you will be King.

10:11.908 --> 10:14.206
Majesty, Prince Shing approaches the gates.

10:15.054 --> 10:17.324
Our time is less than we thought.

10:17.955 --> 10:19.952
Qiang Long, the royal seal.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.997
Yes, your Majesty.

10:30.761 --> 10:32.758
Qiang Long will escort you...

10:33.513 --> 10:37.622
...ensure that you all safely reaches
the General Sen Ching Wen.

10:40.575 --> 10:43.517
I will protect him with my life.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.736
I have made none of these
decisions lightly.

10:55.555 --> 10:59.018
Which is why... I have chosen you.

11:05.474 --> 11:06.707
Father.

11:11.513 --> 11:13.889
Out of necessity, Lian.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.148
A King... tends more to his sons.

11:18.540 --> 11:22.598
But it does not mean... he has any
less love for his daughter.

11:25.402 --> 11:28.439
I trust you... with your brother's life.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.689
With the future of our Kingdom.

11:35.097 --> 11:36.466
Go now.

11:51.963 --> 11:53.678
Majesty.

11:55.223 --> 11:58.475
- It's been a long time.
- Too long, my son.

11:58.902 --> 12:01.858
I came as soon as I heard
of your declining health.

12:01.938 --> 12:05.779
My health has always
been a concern of yours.

12:10.241 --> 12:13.232
I have other concerns, father.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.389
About... rumors I've heard.

12:17.825 --> 12:23.295
Rumors... are the distraction of
children and old women.

12:24.358 --> 12:27.716
Indeed. Unless they are true.

12:28.655 --> 12:34.107
And... what rumor carries...
such weight, my son?

12:35.094 --> 12:38.606
Perhaps we should summon my baby brother
to discuss it?

12:41.300 --> 12:45.514
Unfortunately, your brother
is away from the palace.

12:46.677 --> 12:51.169
<i>I fear your ill health is clouding
your judgement, father.</i>

12:52.181 --> 12:55.239
The throne is my BIRTHRIGHT!!

12:56.076 --> 12:58.819
I earned it, fighting your wars!

12:59.542 --> 13:03.477
Without you... there would be no Kingdom...

13:03.857 --> 13:05.328
.. but everything!

13:07.732 --> 13:09.958
I've given everything for you.

13:10.989 --> 13:13.224
I know... my son.

13:14.369 --> 13:15.421
But please...

13:16.888 --> 13:19.673
...it is in the best
interests of the people.

13:19.793 --> 13:23.912
- What... do you know about THE PEOPLE?!
- Prince Shing!

13:25.730 --> 13:29.348
My son means me... no harm.

13:40.143 --> 13:42.520
My father must trust you very much.

13:45.365 --> 13:51.008
You have family? A wife? Children?

13:53.318 --> 13:58.813
Resist me and I will see that your children
are nailed to the walls of your home...

13:59.073 --> 14:02.145
- ...one piece at a time.
- Shing!

14:02.959 --> 14:08.116
That your wife spends the rest of her life
pleasuring my guards.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.482
Die for a King whose time has passed...

14:13.065 --> 14:15.203
or choose to serve a new one.

14:21.389 --> 14:25.697
- Leave us.
- Out! All of you.

14:42.459 --> 14:44.792
Remember this blade, Father?

14:45.650 --> 14:49.370
Your mother... once saved my life with it.

14:50.206 --> 14:55.793
When I was old enough... she gave it to me.

14:56.659 --> 14:59.022
And told me I would be King.

14:59.217 --> 15:01.733
But you are not the child she loved.

15:07.999 --> 15:09.866
Where is the seal?

15:16.905 --> 15:20.153
Where. Is. The. Seal?

15:59.864 --> 16:02.992
Heaven... forgive him.

16:03.345 --> 16:08.081
Heaven is closed to me... because of
all the things I've done for you.

16:22.499 --> 16:25.600
The King... is dead.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.897
Murdered. By Prince Qiang.

16:30.910 --> 16:34.200
He stole the royal seal.
Bring it to me.

16:41.085 --> 16:42.116
Follow me.

16:44.399 --> 16:47.422
Keep your men under control.

16:47.889 --> 16:49.351
Summon General Gao.

16:50.788 --> 16:51.788
Now.

16:52.214 --> 16:53.858
Or should I send for your family?

17:00.041 --> 17:01.613
The horse!

17:20.540 --> 17:21.877
Stop them!

17:31.435 --> 17:32.717
Go!

18:54.985 --> 18:56.943
Maybe we should just keep going?

18:57.221 --> 19:01.180
And how far will we get? We have no horse.
We need help.

19:10.005 --> 19:12.798
- You stay here.
- But Lian, I should go!

19:13.080 --> 19:17.360
Father chose you, because he knows
you are strong.

19:20.572 --> 19:24.479
Whatever happens, you keep going.
You reach the Generals.

19:24.826 --> 19:26.413
And you will be King.

19:35.117 --> 19:36.372
Be careful.

20:32.381 --> 20:33.381
Here.

20:36.016 --> 20:37.568
No money, no food.

20:44.080 --> 20:48.146
When you first came in,
I thought you might be the White Ghost.

20:50.077 --> 20:51.721
I guess I was wrong.

20:58.288 --> 20:59.762
Is that the Princess?

21:04.558 --> 21:06.015
I seek an escort for the road.

21:12.873 --> 21:13.873
I can pay.

21:14.115 --> 21:17.563
What use is coin to the dead?
The Black Guards are hunting you.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.864
Look who I found skulking outside!

21:26.707 --> 21:28.876
I'm sorry, I did not see them.

21:32.980 --> 21:36.576
- My father will hear of this.
- So the dead have ears.

21:37.644 --> 21:41.297
No, my father is not dead.
It's not true!

21:41.417 --> 21:45.263
Oh, you know it is.
After all it was you who murdered him.

21:46.461 --> 21:50.632
- Or was it you, Princess?
- Shing.

21:52.116 --> 21:54.851
The seal, where is it?

21:59.396 --> 22:00.396
You mind?

22:09.802 --> 22:11.181
Hold them.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.486
No! Stop it.

22:19.273 --> 22:20.563
Give it back to me!

22:22.016 --> 22:25.398
- The seal is mine!
- Cut these throats.

22:37.609 --> 22:40.056
The sword... is mine.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.316
It belongs to me.

22:45.358 --> 22:47.033
I'd like it back.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.707
Then come.

22:51.634 --> 22:53.424
Take it.

23:04.354 --> 23:05.849
Opium.

23:06.894 --> 23:11.029
Your kind are such fools.
Clean him up.

23:19.970 --> 23:21.083
Kill him.

24:28.142 --> 24:29.763
- Lian.
- Qiang!

24:40.614 --> 24:43.825
Either way, the boy dies.

24:45.315 --> 24:51.145
- Kill him then, I just want my sword back.
- If I give it to you, then will you leave?

25:20.319 --> 25:21.977
You have to help us.

25:22.926 --> 25:24.497
Good luck, Princess.

25:45.843 --> 25:47.043
Wait!

26:00.025 --> 26:01.606
Much obliged.

26:02.657 --> 26:04.997
Wait. Qiang, come.

26:05.939 --> 26:09.975
Please! Help us. We must
get to Shing Yuing.

26:10.486 --> 26:13.446
If your reward is what
you seek, we have gold.

26:14.998 --> 26:19.545
My brother is the Kingdom's only hope.
If you don't help us, we will be killed.

26:20.154 --> 26:23.406
Come. You will be if you stay here.

28:15.584 --> 28:19.483
Do what you must,
but there are riders down below.

28:21.016 --> 28:24.242
- How many?
- Wake the boy. Quietly.

28:27.113 --> 28:29.502
Shh. We have to hide.

29:08.110 --> 29:09.600
Keep looking!

29:20.975 --> 29:22.221
Why did you come back?

29:24.065 --> 29:25.617
You had your sword.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.219
You promised gold.

29:36.952 --> 29:39.181
And I was having that way, anyway.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.925
What brings you to our lands?

29:58.773 --> 30:02.413
I know. But it's all we have.

30:24.339 --> 30:25.399
Let's stop.

30:29.394 --> 30:30.428
Wait here.

30:46.768 --> 30:48.475
I said, wait.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.392
This is our fault.

31:07.981 --> 31:10.446
- They need help.
- We need to go, come on.

31:11.382 --> 31:13.025
You can't just go!

31:14.252 --> 31:15.789
Wait!

32:10.812 --> 32:12.374
How is that possible?

32:26.784 --> 32:29.709
- Let me go!
- Come on!

32:37.131 --> 32:38.342
You're welcome.

32:39.819 --> 32:41.259
It's great.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.162
I'm only trying to help.

32:50.216 --> 32:51.801
All right?

32:53.538 --> 32:55.864
- I'm Lian.
- I'm Qiang.

32:57.086 --> 32:58.086
And you?

33:01.219 --> 33:02.645
Xaoi.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.184
Beautiflu name.

33:07.591 --> 33:09.614
We can't just abandon her.

33:11.149 --> 33:14.596
It's one more mouth to feed,
and one more body to hide.

33:18.045 --> 33:20.436
They seek three, not four.

33:25.649 --> 33:27.218
All right.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.324
That shot.
How did you make it?

33:35.598 --> 33:36.971
Practice.

33:37.535 --> 33:40.083
We go off the map, get through the woods.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.978
Hopefully we won't see any
Black Guards until Ching Shao.

33:56.629 --> 33:59.694
Your Majesty, General Gao.

34:01.284 --> 34:01.380
- Lord Shing.
- Majesty.

34:01.460 --> 34:04.162
- Lord Shing.
- Majesty.

34:06.970 --> 34:10.672
How many of your fellow generals
will offer support to the boy?

34:11.811 --> 34:16.583
- Once the Council has officiated over the
appropriate ceremony... - Yes...

34:16.777 --> 34:21.272
...can't be no ceremonies without the seal.

34:22.833 --> 34:28.551
But... if he... has the seal,
there's nothing to be done.

34:36.748 --> 34:38.521
He murdered my father.

34:39.812 --> 34:41.991
Stole the Seal.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.810
If that's the case...

34:46.525 --> 34:49.299
...he will be punished. Accordingly.

34:49.929 --> 34:52.312
It's inexcusable.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.639
Even from a Prince.

35:06.967 --> 35:08.470
Forgive me, General.

35:11.829 --> 35:15.653
My father's murder has
left me overemotional.

35:24.049 --> 35:26.125
They will be heading to Shing Yuing.

35:26.930 --> 35:28.812
Make sure they never get there.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.196
I'm sorry, for what Shing's men did.

35:36.579 --> 35:38.248
He murdered my father, too.

35:38.328 --> 35:41.323
For what, a few coins and a rusty plough?

35:41.540 --> 35:43.132
Does it matter what it was for?

35:43.584 --> 35:46.815
I want to make things better,
for people like you!

35:47.447 --> 35:52.119
Do you think it makes a difference for
people like me - who sits on the throne?

35:52.199 --> 35:55.549
It should. And we change things.

35:56.996 --> 35:58.454
You don't believe me?

35:59.669 --> 36:05.015
I believe you're just a boy,
and Shing Yuing is still faaar away.

36:05.198 --> 36:08.247
And yet, it's closer than yesterday.

36:20.140 --> 36:21.752
We'll make camp here.

36:56.571 --> 36:58.252
I needed that.

36:58.896 --> 37:02.125
Tear of the poppy. Dull the man's senses.

37:04.694 --> 37:06.992
Some things are better dulled.

37:08.812 --> 37:11.304
Our lives and the future of our Kingdom...

37:13.072 --> 37:15.123
...depending upon your wits.

37:16.752 --> 37:18.467
Your Kingdom.

37:23.868 --> 37:25.708
You're far from home.

37:26.873 --> 37:30.576
Are you running? Or searching?

37:31.012 --> 37:32.512
Both.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.658
Your people...

37:39.896 --> 37:43.691
- ...do they believe in Hell?
- We believe in Diyu.

37:44.937 --> 37:46.929
The realm of the Dead.

37:47.931 --> 37:50.929
One is assigned to one of 18 levels.

37:51.009 --> 37:54.477
A place of heart [...]. The Lake of blood.

37:57.723 --> 37:59.480
The punishment fits the crime.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.000
What was yours?

38:05.111 --> 38:07.567
Ohh... there've been many.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.814
We all have our weights to bear.

38:17.386 --> 38:22.648
No doubt, the life of a Princess...
is a heavy burden.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.850
Do you know what it's like - being a woman
in this world?

38:26.050 --> 38:29.889
Do you think watching men destroy
everything you care about bears no weight?

38:30.555 --> 38:32.738
And for what? Pride?

38:34.352 --> 38:35.609
Greed?

38:36.559 --> 38:39.732
You warriors march off
and forge new worlds.

38:39.992 --> 38:42.600
We have to stay behind,
to raise the children.

38:44.463 --> 38:47.123
We have to explain why their
fathers don't return.

38:48.545 --> 38:51.940
And we have to fix the
broken creatures that do.

38:56.559 --> 38:58.959
Do not judge my life.

38:59.219 --> 39:02.848
- When you know nothing about being a woman.
- I'm sorry.

39:03.620 --> 39:06.694
A Princess... is a woman, too.

39:09.543 --> 39:12.548
I am, what you wanted of me.

39:15.194 --> 39:18.221
I did what you needed, but couldn't.

39:22.139 --> 39:24.944
I will have what is mine.

39:36.502 --> 39:37.576
Wake up.

39:44.587 --> 39:46.738
I want to fire arrows like you.

39:54.525 --> 39:55.525
Teach me.

40:12.019 --> 40:13.108
Teach me!

40:17.774 --> 40:19.736
I thought White Devils didn't bathe.

40:21.883 --> 40:24.871
A man picks up bad habits
when he is away from home.

40:26.842 --> 40:30.571
You've been in many battles?
I wish to become a great warrior, too.

40:31.254 --> 40:34.488
My father wanted me to learn from books,
not have to fight.

40:35.939 --> 40:37.478
Teach me!

40:38.083 --> 40:40.213
- Why?
- My father...

40:42.168 --> 40:43.772
Shing must pay.

40:46.512 --> 40:47.560
Please.

40:49.419 --> 40:50.419
Teach me.

40:53.413 --> 40:55.649
Battle is both craft and art.

40:56.878 --> 40:58.977
First you must learn to craft.

41:00.017 --> 41:05.885
Then you push past it, until action and
reaction become instinct. A part of you.

41:07.767 --> 41:11.125
The man who taught you,
was he a great warrior?

41:27.576 --> 41:30.759
Use your back, allright?
Not your shoulders.

41:32.258 --> 41:33.258
Release.

41:49.451 --> 41:50.451
Fire.

42:03.845 --> 42:04.845
Fire!

42:11.151 --> 42:12.151
I'm sorry!

42:13.952 --> 42:14.952
Better.

42:18.101 --> 42:23.064
- You're good with my brother.
- The boy has a good heart and mind.

42:24.516 --> 42:26.226
Like his sister.

42:29.163 --> 42:32.381
If we'd gone East, we'd already
been nearing Shing Yuing.

42:32.535 --> 42:34.895
Where do you think the most of Black Guard
are concentrated?

42:35.502 --> 42:38.331
Once we get past Ching Shao,
there is less chance that they follow.

42:38.826 --> 42:41.648
They follow [...] where
my brother instructs.

42:41.963 --> 42:45.853
In the Silver Mountains there said to be
bandits who despise your brother and his men.

42:46.489 --> 42:50.616
You mean the White Ghost.
Wouldn't he despise us equally?

42:59.972 --> 43:01.701
Quiet, stay low.

43:11.206 --> 43:13.879
We should move on, quickly,
Mount off.

43:19.861 --> 43:21.340
Thank you.
- No thanks.

43:22.707 --> 43:24.141
You're welcome.

43:41.814 --> 43:43.467
Ching Shao.

43:45.853 --> 43:48.062
Everyone will be looking for you.

43:49.490 --> 43:51.567
We need to find a way in.

44:11.492 --> 44:13.901
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

44:15.938 --> 44:20.312
I'm travelling with my mistress and her
servant boy, searching for new company.

44:22.044 --> 44:27.010
You will find us extremely hospitable,
for the right price.

44:32.341 --> 44:35.446
You and your lady are welcome to join us.

44:39.164 --> 44:41.724
She's shy, she enjoys her privacy.

44:42.062 --> 44:45.447
She will enjoy it so much more
in a city full of strangers.

44:58.533 --> 45:00.383
You gave her your gold.

45:03.159 --> 45:06.923
I'll see you are properly rewarded
when we reach Shing Yuing.

45:26.803 --> 45:28.519
Stay calm.

45:34.739 --> 45:36.246
Dismount slowly.

45:44.653 --> 45:47.048
- Out of the cart!
- What seems to be the problem?

45:47.128 --> 45:49.628
We are searching for the
Prince and Princess.

45:50.116 --> 45:52.414
You'll find nothing of interest here.

45:56.963 --> 45:58.836
Let them through!

46:04.887 --> 46:07.201
Come on, let's go.

46:26.630 --> 46:28.317
You did well.

46:48.337 --> 46:51.896
- You should stay with us.
- I think my mistress would prefer
to keep travelling.

46:51.996 --> 46:54.840
You're exhausted, and
think of the children.

46:55.456 --> 46:59.934
I have private rooms, your mistress
will appreciate the privacy.

47:40.902 --> 47:42.535
Waht are you looking at?

47:56.592 --> 47:58.483
You are hungrier than you appeared.

48:00.065 --> 48:04.517
Take my guests to clean up.
They must be tired.

48:11.462 --> 48:12.831
Stay.

48:14.272 --> 48:17.058
I have something that may interest you.

48:27.146 --> 48:29.265
Make sure you are fit to travel.

48:32.455 --> 48:34.668
Thank you for your hospitality.

48:47.660 --> 48:49.853
It's all to your health.

48:58.410 --> 48:59.761
This way.

49:10.064 --> 49:12.593
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.

49:13.389 --> 49:16.694
- He served us well.
- Did anyone say he hasn't?

49:18.319 --> 49:19.777
Now go and get cleaned up.

49:21.094 --> 49:23.434
I want to be ready to leave
first thing tomorrow.

49:23.510 --> 49:26.314
- It's still early.
- Just do as I say, Xiaoli.

49:34.572 --> 49:39.247
If you'll excuse me, I have some business
to attend to.

49:43.852 --> 49:45.603
What did you give me?

49:50.386 --> 49:51.764
Help the man!

49:53.284 --> 49:55.802
Apparently he can't handle his drink.

51:22.187 --> 51:27.197
It's not you they want! They're worth more
money than you've ever seen! Your share alone!

51:28.529 --> 51:30.217
I already have a mistress.

51:32.498 --> 51:36.194
- Come on, you have to go. Come on, now!
- What happened?

51:36.599 --> 51:39.324
Let's go! We've been betrayed.

51:41.112 --> 51:44.719
- Hurry, this way.
- Wait, our horses!

51:44.819 --> 51:48.106
You'll never pass the city gates.
Go to the river and find a boat.

51:48.186 --> 51:50.851
Head downstream, wait for me
at the Silver Mountain.

51:50.931 --> 51:54.366
- There are bandits!
- I know, that's where I was going.

51:54.522 --> 51:56.559
- And you?
- I'll meet you there.

51:57.483 --> 52:00.772
If I don't arrive, Shing Yuing
is a day beyond the mountain.

52:01.650 --> 52:03.704
I don't even know your name.

52:03.705 --> 52:06.421
Please Lian, go. Go now!

52:07.669 --> 52:09.068
Allright, just go.

52:19.027 --> 52:20.688
Untie them all.

52:44.206 --> 52:45.515
Go search the building!

53:05.787 --> 53:07.140
Don't kill him yet!

53:12.654 --> 53:15.207
Where are they? Speak quickly.

53:20.230 --> 53:22.656
Tell me now, or I kill you.

53:24.599 --> 53:28.675
General, Prince Qiang and Princess Lian are on
the river headed toward the Silver M ountains.

53:29.345 --> 53:30.520
Go after them.

56:00.756 --> 56:02.391
Get to the shore!

56:07.094 --> 56:08.571
Run!

57:28.238 --> 57:31.606
<i>Let me go! Let go!</i>

59:22.916 --> 59:24.074
Open your mouth.

01:00:16.259 --> 01:00:18.512
It was my choice, I would have let you rot.

01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:27.894
- My companions?
- Safe!

01:00:29.995 --> 01:00:33.857
The Black Guards are as thick as flies
on a fart [...] ask because of you.

01:00:34.307 --> 01:00:36.043
You brought them here.

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:43.827
- How did you find me, lad?
- Nobody goes East.

01:00:45.965 --> 01:00:47.079
Remember?

01:00:51.999 --> 01:00:55.410
There is few [...] of our
kind beyond Baghdad.

01:01:03.889 --> 01:01:07.990
- We need to talk.
- We have nothing to say. - Please.

01:01:09.387 --> 01:01:13.037
I should have left you in the woods.
For [...]

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:19.780
But you didn't.

01:01:25.823 --> 01:01:28.121
As soon as you can move, you leave.

01:01:30.207 --> 01:01:34.008
Gallain. Gallain, please!

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:53.308
- Please. He lives?
- For now.

01:01:53.503 --> 01:01:57.984
- You're the outlaw they call the White Ghost?
- I am the White Ghost.

01:01:58.351 --> 01:02:03.284
But no one calls me outlaw, child.
Not to my face!

01:02:04.645 --> 01:02:07.785
- Your friend sent us here.
- My friend?

01:02:08.461 --> 01:02:10.705
And you expect that to count in your favor?

01:02:11.514 --> 01:02:14.770
- You saved our lives.
- Well, killing Black Guards, that was no hardship.

01:02:15.369 --> 01:02:17.037
Your lives have value.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:19.838
Yes, my love.

01:02:20.561 --> 01:02:25.050
- Shing will pay handsomely for your return.
- Or he might just kill you. Outlaw!

01:02:26.465 --> 01:02:29.717
If we escape my brother,
I will be the King.

01:02:31.311 --> 01:02:34.756
- How old are you? 10?
- 14!

01:02:36.668 --> 01:02:39.618
- And I should help you, because?
- I will give you a reward!

01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:44.219
- And you may come down from this mountain!
A free man.
- Now, I do not know.

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:49.740
In my experience those who climb to the top only
ever remember they got there by their own effort.

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.683
- I won't forget!
- Maybe you will, maybe you won't.
I need time to think.

01:02:54.503 --> 01:02:57.596
You are lucky my wife likes you.
Where is my wine?!

01:03:00.912 --> 01:03:03.351
Free them, they got nowhere to run.

01:03:22.158 --> 01:03:23.991
You were his friend.

01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:29.400
We fought alongside one another.

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:32.637
- He belives he's damned.
- He's right.

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:36.223
We were, all of us - killers.

01:03:38.534 --> 01:03:40.224
But he became...

01:03:41.983 --> 01:03:43.609
...more than that.

01:03:45.705 --> 01:03:49.204
- That what warriors do!
- Some get a taste for blood.

01:03:51.114 --> 01:03:52.971
He is not one of them.

01:03:53.725 --> 01:03:58.020
There was a time I wanted that to be true,
as much as you do now.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.611
At least he still sees hope in others.

01:04:04.825 --> 01:04:08.927
Puts his sword at the service of that,
rather than his own game.

01:04:34.575 --> 01:04:36.448
Your Majesty, we have news!

01:04:42.067 --> 01:04:43.525
Saddle the horses.

01:05:07.433 --> 01:05:08.853
Jacob...

01:05:10.717 --> 01:05:15.791
- My name is Jacob.
- Nice to meet you, Jacob.

01:05:18.778 --> 01:05:22.478
- I am sorry.
- For what?

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:28.271
We'd never have come this far without you.

01:05:35.086 --> 01:05:38.136
You... don't have to do that.

01:05:39.105 --> 01:05:41.962
I know. I want to.

01:05:43.228 --> 01:05:47.319
There's not much else to do here,
except watch Xaoi eat.

01:05:53.903 --> 01:05:55.862
She lives because of you.

01:05:57.091 --> 01:05:58.091
As do we.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.884
Maybe you've repaid your debt.

01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:08.852
Rest, for now.

01:06:13.851 --> 01:06:16.251
Please, help me.

01:06:17.453 --> 01:06:19.302
I must see him.

01:06:50.464 --> 01:06:51.464
What?

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.490
Oh man, don't you ever stop?

01:07:17.652 --> 01:07:22.358
Here, fucking opium.
It keeps the ghosts away, huh?

01:07:23.356 --> 01:07:24.861
This is MY medicine.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.708
What you saw that day...

01:07:30.176 --> 01:07:33.713
If it's forgiveness that brought you here,
you've come a long way for nothing.

01:07:34.482 --> 01:07:37.637
Perhaps you've come to tell me
it was some terrible mistake?

01:07:38.295 --> 01:07:42.376
- That you didn't kill them? Huh?
- I can't tell you that.

01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:46.175
But they did not die by
my sword, I promise.

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.434
Riddles give me headaches.

01:07:54.494 --> 01:07:57.637
The children were killed
by their own mothers.

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.923
The women died by their own hands.

01:08:19.745 --> 01:08:22.703
Because they fear of what you have become.

01:08:23.506 --> 01:08:24.511
Yes.

01:08:26.586 --> 01:08:27.845
What is it?

01:08:29.091 --> 01:08:32.613
You think if you save this boy,
God will forgive you?

01:08:34.794 --> 01:08:38.816
Men can not know God's will,
and when they pretend to...

01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:43.323
- ...it ends in blood.
- That I'll drink to.

01:09:00.667 --> 01:09:04.399
So what happened to you?
The White Ghost, bandits?

01:09:05.215 --> 01:09:09.960
I tried my hand as a merchant.
But the Black Guards took all I had.

01:09:12.203 --> 01:09:17.055
My wife - she's good
with a knife, aint't it?

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:24.140
But in one time... she had the most...
beautiful... singing voice.

01:09:25.067 --> 01:09:27.140
But the... Guards...

01:09:28.743 --> 01:09:31.216
...cut out her tongue!!

01:09:32.036 --> 01:09:36.142
Blinded my right eye.
But I still have her.

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:39.390
Which is all that really matters.

01:09:40.374 --> 01:09:44.148
If Shing becomes King, this land will burn.

01:09:44.818 --> 01:09:49.073
All lands burn, Jacob. You know that.

01:09:49.624 --> 01:09:51.049
Better than anyone.

01:09:53.397 --> 01:09:55.175
I have to take a piss.

01:10:28.049 --> 01:10:29.719
You should be resting.

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:33.894
I'm younger and healthier than you.

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.882
I made a promise to my father.

01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:48.984
I swore to him...

01:10:50.909 --> 01:10:52.932
...I'd protect Qiang with my life.

01:11:00.219 --> 01:11:01.571
But you...

01:11:03.321 --> 01:11:04.443
...why?

01:11:10.286 --> 01:11:13.407
I once looked for God
in all of the wrong places.

01:11:16.662 --> 01:11:19.150
But you... your brother...

01:11:21.308 --> 01:11:23.226
It started to make sense again.

01:11:28.578 --> 01:11:30.671
My father would have liked you.

01:11:32.945 --> 01:11:38.291
Ohhh, I don't know. I think your father
would have taken my head.

01:11:42.611 --> 01:11:44.291
And rightly so.

01:11:47.587 --> 01:11:49.868
Perhaps to the man we first met.

01:11:51.698 --> 01:11:55.750
But you... he would have loved.

01:11:58.234 --> 01:11:59.950
Lian, I...

01:12:26.978 --> 01:12:28.812
He's been out there for hours.

01:12:29.307 --> 01:12:32.064
With the right people by his side
he will hold the peace.

01:12:33.747 --> 01:12:38.148
You sound like one of those priests
that blessed us as we marched off to war.

01:12:39.809 --> 01:12:41.349
The ghosts...

01:12:42.143 --> 01:12:45.560
- ...you really see them, too?
- Only when I let my guard down.

01:12:46.385 --> 01:12:48.385
And what do they ask of you?

01:12:51.357 --> 01:12:55.134
- Mine don't talk.
- They don't need to.

01:12:56.784 --> 01:12:59.898
And if they did?
What would the dead whisper?

01:13:00.578 --> 01:13:02.381
What is ought, must be paid.

01:13:06.588 --> 01:13:09.063
It's not for us to decide when, though.

01:13:11.574 --> 01:13:14.236
To the damned, each and every one of us.

01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:18.567
You are not hard enough on him.

01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:22.463
- Gallain, with your help...
- No!

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.159
I told you before!

01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:29.198
I'm done fighting other men's causes.

01:13:30.183 --> 01:13:33.808
- Ah, you could have handed him over to Shing.
- I'm a simple man.

01:13:34.258 --> 01:13:37.283
Easily bedazzled by swift-talking
young Princess.

01:13:37.598 --> 01:13:41.684
You are many things, none of them simple.

01:14:07.378 --> 01:14:09.629
They have [...] reached the riverbank.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:15.355
We have no choice now.
Make what preparations you can!

01:14:36.306 --> 01:14:38.886
No more that four bombs in each bag.

01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:42.427
I chose this place for a reason.

01:14:42.635 --> 01:14:45.361
We beat them down below,
take as many as we can.

01:14:45.441 --> 01:14:47.864
- Bring confusion.
- Fall back to the caves?

01:14:49.087 --> 01:14:52.202
- No, you stay here.
- But they're here for me.

01:14:53.881 --> 01:14:58.106
And if you die on the Mountain, you will
never be the leader your father wanted.

01:15:05.566 --> 01:15:07.123
Be careful.

01:15:55.552 --> 01:16:01.598
SHIELDS!! SHIELDS UP!! SHIELDS!!!

01:16:02.155 --> 01:16:06.564
Return fire! RETURN FIRE NOW!!!

01:16:19.611 --> 01:16:20.954
Fall back!!

01:17:37.195 --> 01:17:39.070
Get back to the cave, now!!

01:17:47.282 --> 01:17:49.652
Back to the cave, we'll finish them there!

01:17:59.201 --> 01:18:00.898
LET'S GO!!

01:18:09.807 --> 01:18:12.650
- Get your sister and Xiaoli back to the inner cave.
- I should stay!

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:16.705
- You've got nothing more to prove, all right? Men
have died for you, don't let that be in vain.

01:18:17.072 --> 01:18:19.423
Go! Go now!

01:19:06.165 --> 01:19:08.198
Mei!! NOW!!

01:19:11.215 --> 01:19:13.967
The Black Guards!!

01:19:20.667 --> 01:19:24.154
GO!! GO, MEI, GO!!

01:20:22.235 --> 01:20:27.531
Go... get the boy... now!

01:20:43.747 --> 01:20:47.140
You want my blood?
You want my BLOOD?!

01:21:07.438 --> 01:21:12.174
- The others? - Oh, it's just Gallain. We have
to leave, before more Black Guards arrive.

01:22:51.037 --> 01:22:52.913
I see you...

01:22:55.583 --> 01:22:57.287
...woman...

01:23:01.225 --> 01:23:02.923
I see you...

01:23:27.228 --> 01:23:30.108
Qiang Lian and the white monkey.

01:23:31.731 --> 01:23:33.217
Did you help them?

01:23:34.954 --> 01:23:36.943
Or was it this one?

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:49.760
No. I think this one is the White Ghost.

01:23:53.551 --> 01:23:57.161
- Why?
- Because...

01:23:58.607 --> 01:24:00.438
...the boy isn't like us.

01:24:02.429 --> 01:24:04.373
And what are we like?

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.738
The world will be better without us.

01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:18.271
And you... little brother.

01:24:20.052 --> 01:24:23.559
Do you really think bandits and barbarians
can win you the throne?

01:24:23.639 --> 01:24:26.308
Our father would hate what you have become.

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:34.902
Then it's probably a good
thing you killed him.

01:25:03.834 --> 01:25:06.605
You've spilled a lot of blood today.

01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:12.882
Let's see how much you have left.

01:26:44.317 --> 01:26:47.450
Who [...] his bow, dies!

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.853
Careful, then. You might cut yourself.

01:27:15.295 --> 01:27:18.361
No more, Shing... no more...

01:27:24.685 --> 01:27:26.311
Lian, no!!

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:10.361
<i>Lord Shing is dead.</i>

01:28:37.256 --> 01:28:40.351
- Sister!
- I'll be all right.

01:28:46.552 --> 01:28:51.357
- What were you thinking?
- Of my country...

01:28:53.014 --> 01:28:56.480
And Qiang... I love you...

01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:04.910
I'm sorry.

01:29:14.275 --> 01:29:15.885
Your Majesty.

01:29:25.711 --> 01:29:27.257
Please, forgive me.
