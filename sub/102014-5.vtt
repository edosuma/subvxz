18:09.797 --> 18:11.882
You didn't want me
going back to Wall Street

18:11.965 --> 18:13.717

the same argument, so I agreed.

When you and Chad worked together,
you outperformed him. Right?

19:43.140 --> 19:44.474
Almost every week.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.477
Okay. That's threatening
to an alpha like Chad.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.938
He's vain. Like Hiram.

I said a prayer, Veronica.

I thought...

is now we can do those things.

29:33.062 --> 29:33.897
Thank you.

29:33.980 --> 29:37.025
No problem. But I'll expect to hear
from you by the end of the week.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.860
-The end of the week?
-About my novel?

29:38.943 --> 29:41.029
-And about giving it to your agent?
-Mm-hm.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.822
And if I don't hear from you,

29:43.698 --> 29:45.325
I know who I'm gonna call.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.410
[dramatic music playing]

29:59.047 --> 30:00.840
[cell phone ringing]

30:16.397 --> 30:19.150
[Archie] This is nuts. I haven't
seen you guys in, what, six years?

30:19.234 --> 30:20.485
[Toni] It's been seven.

30:21.611 --> 30:24.322
Wow. Lots of catching up to do.

30:24.405 --> 30:28.701
I had a job lined up after graduation
with Riverdale Social Services,

30:28.785 --> 30:30.829
but their offices got shut down.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.540
Lucky for her, we needed
a counselor at Riverdale High.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.291
You're looking at the new Mrs. Burble.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.336
Wait. You're working
at Riverdale High too, Kev?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.255
Yep. Drama teacher.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.466
Got my BA from Carnegie Mellon
in Pittsburgh, where...

30:43.967 --> 30:46.636
I graduated
from the University of Pittsburgh.

30:47.971 --> 30:48.805
Whoo.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.724
We stayed boyfriends, believe it or not.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.060
-And now we live together here.
-Mm-hm.

30:54.143 --> 30:56.813
With me. In an apartment
on Cloverfield Lane.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.648
-That's amazing.
-[Toni chuckles]

30:58.731 --> 31:00.149
Sweet Pea, what about you, bro?

31:00.233 --> 31:02.819
Mostly held down the fort here
while these guys were gone.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.279
Then, when Toni got back...

31:04.362 --> 31:07.574
We decided to revive the Serpents.
Under my leadership.

31:07.657 --> 31:09.117
I was crowned the Serpent Queen.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.452
Well, I gotta say, this place is sick.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.956
Pulls in a different crowd though.
What's with the truckers?

31:15.039 --> 31:17.208
Serpents drive trucks,
including me and Fangs.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.960
-Toni had the hookup.
-[Archie] Impressive.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.129
Hey, what about Cheryl?

31:24.883 --> 31:27.135
It's cool, guys.

31:27.218 --> 31:30.680
-After graduation, Cheryl and I broke up.
-RIP, Choni.

31:30.763 --> 31:35.310
After I got back from Highsmith,
I went to check on her a couple times...

31:35.935 --> 31:37.103
[Cheryl] <i>Hello, Antoinette.</i>

31:37.770 --> 31:38.980
[Toni] Cheryl.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.691
-I thought we could talk.
-[construction noise in background]

31:41.774 --> 31:43.484
I'm afraid now isn't a good time.

31:43.985 --> 31:47.030
We're in the midst
of renovating Thornhill.

31:47.113 --> 31:50.491
And I've got my painting to finish.
Perhaps another day?

31:51.951 --> 31:53.703
Uh... Sure.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.873
Cheryl, are you okay?

31:59.542 --> 32:03.046
I'm perfectly fine.
Do I appear to be otherwise?

32:04.172 --> 32:05.548
My mistake.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.188
And? Did you go back?

32:20.271 --> 32:22.732
I did. Not too long ago.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.777
But this time,
I wasn't Thornhill's only visitor.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.571
Hiram was there
with his right-hand man Reggie.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.615
Reggie's working for Hiram Lodge?

32:31.574 --> 32:35.161
[Cheryl] I will never sell you
my maple groves, you vulgarian.

32:35.244 --> 32:37.080
Nana and I plan to be buried
amongst those trees.

32:37.163 --> 32:41.292
-We could make that happen.
-Goodbye, would-be usurper.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.010
-Business with Hiram Lodge?
-No.

32:51.094 --> 32:55.223
He comes by every other week,
offering to buy my maple groves, but...

32:55.848 --> 32:58.309
I'm really glad to see you, Toni.

32:58.935 --> 33:02.689
I wonder if you would do me
the honor of letting me paint you.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.275
Uh...

33:08.152 --> 33:11.114
Cheryl, no one's seen you
in town in years.

33:11.197 --> 33:12.907
[Cheryl] Don't worry about me.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.909
Nana and I are just fine.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.954
-There's no reason for us to leave.
-Okay.

33:18.788 --> 33:21.374
Well, don't you wanna hear about me?

33:21.457 --> 33:22.417
Let's see.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.336
You graduated with a 3.9 GPA.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.880
You majored in social work
with a minor in photography.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.717
And you did extensive charity
and social work.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.844
Am I missing anything important?

33:32.927 --> 33:35.763
Well, other than the fact
I'm having a baby.

33:36.889 --> 33:38.433
I'd heard that, yes.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.311
Congratulations, Toni.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.772
I won't ask who the father is.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.483
I'm completely out
and open with my family.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.985
We've talked about you.

33:49.068 --> 33:52.196
They recognize and acknowledge
everything you've done

33:52.280 --> 33:54.407
to make up for your ancestors' sins.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.828
I think that they'd approve
of us being together.

33:58.911 --> 34:00.913
[dramatic music playing]

34:01.456 --> 34:04.167
I'm so happy to hear that, Toni.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.628
But it's not nearly enough.

34:08.337 --> 34:12.133
The Blossom curse runs deep.
I'm doomed to a life of unhappiness.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.052
You think you're cursed.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.180
Beloved Tee-Tee...

34:19.140 --> 34:21.726
are you familiar
with the Winchester House?

34:21.809 --> 34:24.103
I've seen the movie with Helen Mirren.

34:24.187 --> 34:27.899
Sarah Winchester came
from a family of rifle-makers.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.567
Winchester rifles.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.527
One by one,

34:32.111 --> 34:35.448
family members suffered
painful, horrific fates.

34:36.407 --> 34:40.870
Cursed by the deaths brought on
by their family's stock and trade, rifles.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.414
Only Sarah survived.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.626
So she started to build a house.

34:48.294 --> 34:49.837
The Winchester House.

34:50.630 --> 34:55.176
She believed that as long as it remained
under constant construction...

34:56.928 --> 34:58.763
the curse couldn't consume her.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.099
Is that why you're rebuilding Thornhill?

35:04.102 --> 35:04.977
Toni...

35:05.937 --> 35:08.064
I'm glad you're doing so well.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.900
You deserve to be happy.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.201
[Toni] <i>She didn't say another word.</i>

35:20.284 --> 35:22.370
<i>She just painted me for 12 hours,</i>

35:22.453 --> 35:24.372
<i>and when she was done, I left.</i>

35:24.455 --> 35:27.834
A week later, a package showed up,
and it was my portrait.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.132
She didn't keep it as a reminder
of what you guys had?

35:34.215 --> 35:35.842
I guess she didn't want it.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.720
[Nana] <i>Well done, my dear.</i>

35:40.471 --> 35:43.182
It's exactly like the original.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.228
It's a perfect copy.

35:48.437 --> 35:49.856
You've learned well.

35:50.523 --> 35:53.693
Now, the question is...

35:54.861 --> 35:58.406
would you be able to replicate
the work of a master?

35:59.073 --> 36:00.783
Like, say, um...

36:01.242 --> 36:02.493
Rembrandt?

36:05.246 --> 36:07.582
[rock music playing over speakers]

36:07.665 --> 36:10.501
Toni, earlier you said
the town had changed.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.421
I'll regret asking this,
but can you tell me how?

36:14.213 --> 36:17.341
-I think it might be better to show you.
-Okay.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.467
Where are you staying?

36:18.551 --> 36:21.512
I'm crashing at the El Royale.
My mom's renting out our house.

36:21.596 --> 36:22.555
Right.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.183
The renters. Um...

36:25.266 --> 36:28.186
-I'll pick you up at the gym.
-Okay. Thanks, Toni.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.272
-You mind if I stay to make a few calls?
-Go for it.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.237
[line rings]

36:50.208 --> 36:51.834
-Archie?
-[Archie] Toni.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.087
I figured a steel gate would be enough
to keep this gym intact,

36:55.171 --> 36:57.048
but this place is like a war zone.

36:57.131 --> 37:00.301
Wait till you see the rest of the town.
Come on, my bike's out front.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.386
[dramatic music playing]

37:06.140 --> 37:08.351
[Toni] This was the fire station,
remember?

37:08.434 --> 37:11.103
It was a burnt-up shell
when I got back from college.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.772
No one's trying to rebuild it?

37:12.855 --> 37:15.358
The town's funding has been stripped by--

37:15.441 --> 37:17.235
-Hiram Lodge.
-Bingo.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.070
Not only is the fire department gone,

37:19.153 --> 37:22.198
but the Sheriff's Office is down
to one man, Kevin's dad.

37:22.281 --> 37:24.325
I don't understand. What are people doing?

37:24.408 --> 37:27.536
Fending for themselves?
The town's lawless now.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.081
[alarms blaring in distance]

37:31.749 --> 37:33.125
This was Pickens Park.

[toy squeaks]

37:39.757 --> 37:40.925
Where is everybody?

37:41.884 --> 37:44.011
Whoever could afford
to leave is long gone.

37:44.595 --> 37:48.224
Only the people who are too poor
or too proud to move on are still here.

37:49.141 --> 37:51.310
[dogs barking]

37:52.561 --> 37:54.772
This was Sketch Alley.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.483
Now we just call it what it is. Skid row.

37:58.025 --> 38:00.611
Those dogs are everywhere. Packs of them.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.196
Some are rabid.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.335
[Archie] This is the fifth bus stop
that's been trashed, melted.

38:16.419 --> 38:17.545
Five of dozens.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.755
There's always a fire
burning in Riverdale.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.883
Why burn a bench for no reason?
Where will people sit for the bus?

38:22.967 --> 38:26.137
That's the thing.
Buses don't pass by here anymore.

38:26.220 --> 38:28.431
Sometimes, my trucks do,

38:28.514 --> 38:31.142
but only if they have to
and rarely at night.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.811
Bad things happen here after dark.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.147
They call this the Lonely Highway.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.358
Why destroy an entire town for nothing?

38:40.401 --> 38:43.487
-What does Hiram Lodge have to gain?
-I'll show you.

38:51.662 --> 38:55.458
-I don't get it. Where are the houses?
-This isn't SoDale proper.

38:55.541 --> 38:58.419
This is where Hiram's building
a turnpike that leads to SoDale,

38:58.502 --> 39:00.588
about half a mile due east.

39:00.671 --> 39:03.507
He's catering to the rich folk
who can commute into the city.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.427
So he's strangling Riverdale
to boost SoDale?

39:06.969 --> 39:09.013
Their kids will go to SoDale High?

39:09.096 --> 39:11.682
Stonewall Prep. That place is the same.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.726
Except Hiram bought a seat on the board.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.895
And so the nightmare continues.

39:16.812 --> 39:20.232
There's one more place
I think you should see on the tour.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.777
But you'll have to brace yourself.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.738
[rock music playing inside house]

39:26.906 --> 39:28.699
[Archie] The Ghoulies moved into my house?

-Wanna go in there and knock some heads?
-As a matter of fact, I do.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.166
First things first, Toni.
Can we go back to Pop's?

39:37.249 --> 39:39.710
-See if any of them actually came?
-Okay.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.765
Same. I missed all of you.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.744
I'll leave you guys to it, then.

40:13.828 --> 40:16.414
No. You're as much
a part of this as any of us.

40:21.752 --> 40:22.753
Look, guys.

40:22.837 --> 40:25.840
Toni gave me a tour
of Riverdale today and it's--

40:27.133 --> 40:28.717
It's a hellscape.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.929
I know I called you here
for Pop's retirement party...

40:32.471 --> 40:34.348
but we have a much bigger agenda now.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.933
Riverdale's dying.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.311
We might be the only ones who can save it.

I can't convince you to stay, Squeaky?

40:54.660 --> 40:56.579
I'll give you more shifts
if it would help.

40:56.662 --> 41:00.958
I appreciate that, Tabitha,
but Riverdale is done with me.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.210
And I am done with Riverdale.
