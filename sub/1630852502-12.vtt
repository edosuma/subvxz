WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:03.828
why don't you just tell me
why you're actually here?

00:03.873 --> 00:06.093
- I have stomach cancer.
- Wasn't it three weeks ago,

00:06.136 --> 00:07.659
I asked you to go see
Doctor Mitchell?

00:07.703 --> 00:09.052
Have you gone?

00:09.096 --> 00:10.662
- Every time I look
at my sister,

00:10.706 --> 00:13.665
I'm reminded of the one thing
I can't give her back.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.406
Our parents.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.328
[gunfire]

00:41.563 --> 00:43.608
[muffled gunfire]

01:00.277 --> 01:03.367
[beeping]

01:03.411 --> 01:05.674
- You never go in.

01:05.717 --> 01:08.242
Why is that?

01:09.417 --> 01:11.245
- I can't.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.161
- You need to face it.

01:15.336 --> 01:16.728
For her.

01:16.772 --> 01:19.514
[beeping]

01:30.916 --> 01:33.702
[theme music]

01:48.847 --> 01:51.589
- There's nowhere
to wash your hands,
to, you know,

01:51.633 --> 01:53.852
he didn't have a napkin
or a handkerchief.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.419
It was disgusting!

01:55.463 --> 01:57.595
And anyway, we would've been
here by now if we'd driven.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.163
- Well, I like the subway,
and I'm not letting myself

02:00.207 --> 02:01.947
get sucked into
your rarified air.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.167
- Why?
You might get used to it?

02:04.211 --> 02:06.648
[laughs]

02:09.346 --> 02:11.131
Ah! Thank you!

02:12.393 --> 02:13.829
- Three injured
in a car accident.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.483
ETA six minutes.

02:15.526 --> 02:16.875
- Great.
- Bye.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.616
- Okay, you too.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.315
[moaning]
- Navia Khan. 42. Uber driver.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.707
Crashed into a vehicle
on Spadina.

02:22.751 --> 02:23.969
- The light was green.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.797
I didn't realize
she hadn't started moving

02:25.841 --> 02:27.582
until it was too late.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.540
- Pelvic injuries, lacerations
and a dislocated shoulder.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.716
BP's 140 over 95, rate's 120.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.457
- Are there any traumas...
[indistinct]

02:33.501 --> 02:35.372
- Was speed a factor?
- Cops said no.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.765
- Is she gonna be okay?

02:36.808 --> 02:38.201
- We're gonna take
good care of her.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.727
- Sonja Jessup was rear-ended.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.338
34 years old.
Wounds seem minor.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.209
She cut herself on broken glass
helping the other driver

02:46.253 --> 02:47.515
and her passenger
out of their vehicle.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.212
- Doctor, have a look at
Ms. Jessup checked over.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.301
Use E.
- Manny Kowalski.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.738
34 years old. Complaining
of severe abdo pain,

02:53.782 --> 02:55.305
but there's no evidence
of trauma.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.829
His BP's 130 over 95,
rate's 120,

02:57.873 --> 02:59.614
his temp's 38.3.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.444
- Sir, I'm so sorry!

03:03.487 --> 03:05.489
[grunts]
- I've had worse drivers.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.405
At least you got me
to my destination.

03:08.449 --> 03:09.885
- You were trying
to get the hospital?

03:09.928 --> 03:12.235
- I had this pain in my gut
for a while.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.542
- How long have you been
having this pain, Mr. Kowalski?

03:14.585 --> 03:16.239
- A month, maybe.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.762
But it's been getting worse.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.895
Today it was finally bad enough
to get me to come in.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.245
- Alright, on a scale
of one to ten when I do this?

03:22.289 --> 03:25.727
[grunts]
- Ah! Fifteen.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.816
- Five of morphine
for Mr. Kowalski.

03:27.859 --> 03:31.559
- I swear, I'm not usually
such a snowflake.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.474
- No need to be a hero here.
Possible kidney stone?

03:33.517 --> 03:35.563
[moaning in pain]

03:35.606 --> 03:38.609
- Positive seatbelt sign.
Claire, I need a plate.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.394
- Your shoulder's
back in place,

03:40.437 --> 03:41.873
but this wound will need
to be stitched.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.485
- What did you say about
a seatbelt sign?

03:44.528 --> 03:46.530
- We're gonna do an X-ray and
an ultrasound of your pelvis.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.445
Seatbelt pressure can sometimes
cause it to fracture.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.707
Okay, plate in?

03:51.666 --> 03:54.321
1, 2, 3.
[moaning]

03:54.364 --> 03:55.626
Exposing!

03:56.932 --> 03:58.760
Plate out.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.588
1, 2, 3.

04:00.631 --> 04:01.763
- X-ray's up!

04:04.505 --> 04:07.638
- There's free fluid
in the pelvis,

04:07.682 --> 04:09.771
but no fracture,
that's strange.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.294
- They usually go hand in hand.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.469
- I'll try a blind Foley.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.905
- What does that mean?

04:13.949 --> 04:15.385
- There might be a tear
in your bladder

04:15.429 --> 04:16.995
from the force of the seat belt.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.910
I'm going to place a catheter.
If it comes back with urine,

04:18.954 --> 04:20.608
we'll know your bladder's
intact and a tear's unlikely.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.392
Claire?
- On it.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.438
[moaning]

04:24.481 --> 04:27.005
- Complex fluid collection
in the abdominal cavity.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.746
Dr. Bishop,
I'm seeing debris.

04:28.790 --> 04:32.533
- Sir, have you had
open surgery recently?

04:32.576 --> 04:34.752
- I had a hernia removed.
- Here?

04:34.796 --> 04:36.058
- Another hospital.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.581
But that was like a year ago.

04:37.625 --> 04:38.843
Why?
Is something wrong?

04:38.887 --> 04:40.628
- We'll X-ray
and have a closer look.

04:40.671 --> 04:42.630
Give me the plate.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.851
- Thank God I had already
dropped my kids off at school.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.767
If they'd been in the car
and gotten hurt...

04:49.811 --> 04:50.855
Ow!

04:52.727 --> 04:54.337
- Sorry.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.122
Well, uh, nothing seems
to be broken,

04:57.166 --> 04:59.734
though soft tissue injuries are
common after a car collision.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.388
I can give you something
for the discomfort.

05:02.954 --> 05:06.131
- No, this is, uh, nothing new.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.959
I've had back pain for years.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.483
- Okay.
Can I just see your hands?

05:09.526 --> 05:10.875
- Sure.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.616
It's not too bad.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.357
Still, we should do
some imaging.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.489
Is there someone we can call?

05:16.490 --> 05:18.579
- My husband's on his way.
- Great.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.058
- No urine.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.670
- Probable rupture.
- Can you fix that?

05:22.713 --> 05:24.367
- Well, we'll confirm with a CT.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.847
Then, you'll need
a surgical consult.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.152
- I'll page Urology.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.503
- We'll take good care of you.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.072
- Those have been in there
for a year?

05:34.116 --> 05:36.118
- This only makes sense
with the information...

05:36.161 --> 05:37.728
- What's been in where?

05:37.772 --> 05:41.384
- Sir, whoever performed
your hernia operation

05:41.428 --> 05:43.473
left two surgical sponges
behind.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.433
- You're telling me that they
forgot something inside of me?

05:46.476 --> 05:48.652
- It would explain
your infection,

05:48.696 --> 05:50.088
your fever, your stomach pain.

05:50.132 --> 05:51.960
We're gonna get you to surgery
as soon as we can.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.788
- Two grams of Ampi, IV-stat.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.050
<i>[Bashir]: Deep breath.</i>

05:59.576 --> 06:00.795
And again.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.061
Sonja?

06:07.715 --> 06:08.890
Sonja!

06:08.933 --> 06:10.674
Can you hear me?

06:14.156 --> 06:15.897
[gasps]

06:20.075 --> 06:22.730
You lost consciousness,
Ms. Jessup.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.688
Your respiration rate's low.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.603
Do you remember
hitting your head?

06:26.647 --> 06:28.649
Any headache?
- No.

06:28.692 --> 06:31.216
Um, I'm just dizzy.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.088
Uh, it's probably
from all the blood.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.524
I'm fine, I'm sure.

06:34.568 --> 06:35.960
I'm sure it's nothing.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.658
- Easy, easy, easy.

06:37.701 --> 06:40.791
Just... take a second.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.751
I'm going to order a CT scan

06:43.794 --> 06:45.753
to rule out
any intercranial injury,

06:45.796 --> 06:47.624
also get some blood work done

06:47.668 --> 06:49.452
to make sure there's
nothing else going on.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.193
Okay?
- Okay.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.716
- Alright, I'll be right back.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.416
- Really?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.636
- Complicated differential?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.638
- No, not exactly.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.727
I got invited to this party,

07:03.771 --> 07:05.468
like, old friends
from med school.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.905
I should go, but I--
- Don't wanna go alone?

07:07.949 --> 07:10.125
Sounds like you need a buffer.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.996
Not my thing.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.869
What about, uh... Hmm!

07:16.523 --> 07:18.873
- No, no, no.
No one from Neurology. No.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.530
- He sings when he cuts.

07:23.573 --> 07:26.533
- I don't think going with
a random is the way to go,
you know?

07:29.057 --> 07:30.754
- Hmm?

07:43.985 --> 07:46.770
- Hey, what are you doing here?

07:46.814 --> 07:49.947
- Hey!
My surgery is today.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.297
- Well, that's
on the sixth floor.
That's not down here.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.951
- I called your brother.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.779
He didn't want to come up
from Chicago.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.739
- Elevators are down the hall.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.480
- June!

08:02.264 --> 08:04.179
- That looked intense.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.486
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.966
- Who was that guy?

08:09.010 --> 08:10.141
Hmm?

08:10.185 --> 08:11.969
- That's my father.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.536
- Okay.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.146
He's not a patient here, is he?

08:15.190 --> 08:16.583
Is everything okay?

08:16.626 --> 08:18.280
- Apart from being
a giant prick?

08:19.934 --> 08:22.763
He has stomach cancer
and Singh's his surgeon.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.635
- Okay, so your father's sick
and your boss is his surgeon?

08:25.679 --> 08:26.984
Why wouldn't you tell me
something like that?

08:27.028 --> 08:28.986
- I told you that my dad and I
don't talk.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.858
- Which means you and I
don't either?

08:32.250 --> 08:33.687
Look, June,

08:33.730 --> 08:35.645
I get that your relationship's
messed up,

08:35.688 --> 08:37.559
and you don't like
to talk about it.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.909
But you can't just shut me out
of big chunks of your life.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.565
It makes me feel like
you don't want me in it at all.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.568
- Lou, trust me.
I'm doing you a favor, okay?

08:45.612 --> 08:47.265
That guy--
- Well, maybe
I don't need you to.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.531
- Lou!

08:58.886 --> 09:01.192
- Excuse me, Doctor?
I'm, uh, Jason.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.629
Sonja Jessup's husband.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.326
- Bashir Hamed.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.589
- Uh, she said
she was rear-ended.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.243
Is that true?
- Yes.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.811
- And she's, um, she's okay?

09:10.854 --> 09:13.204
- We're running some tests
to make sure.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.337
- Uh, Dr. Hamed,

09:15.380 --> 09:19.167
did Sonja ask you
for painkillers?

09:19.210 --> 09:21.299
- She's managing fine.

09:21.343 --> 09:24.694
- If she does ask for some,

09:24.738 --> 09:26.348
please don't give her any.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.784
- Sir?

09:30.091 --> 09:31.962
- My wife's an opioid addict.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.051
She's been clean six months.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.576
It's important you don't even
offer her any.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.840
Thank you.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.633
- Thank you.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.596
Mags?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.207
Does this CT look normal to you?

10:00.730 --> 10:02.166
- Yeah.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.647
Yeah, I don't think your
patient sustained head trauma.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.562
- Doesn't seem like it
from her scan,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.477
but she passed out
during the physical exam

10:08.520 --> 10:10.697
and her respiratory rate is low.
- You have a theory?

10:10.740 --> 10:13.438
- Her husband just told me
she's had problems with opioids.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.571
- Did you run blood work?

10:15.615 --> 10:19.096
- Labs aren't back yet,
but according to her chart,

10:19.140 --> 10:21.664
she was here a couple of times
eight months ago

10:21.708 --> 10:23.535
requesting narcotics
for back pain.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.842
The last doctor she saw here
wouldn't prescribe any.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.365
- Did she ask for any today?

10:27.409 --> 10:29.237
- No, even though
she's clearly in pain.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.891
- She probably knows
that she's flagged.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.241
Doesn't wanna
draw attention to it.

10:33.284 --> 10:36.505
Decreased resp rate,
losing consciousness,
no head trauma?

10:36.548 --> 10:39.421
- Her husband said
she's clean now.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.684
- Still, it's kind of tough
to ignore what those symptoms
are saying.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.295
- That she's using again.

10:51.738 --> 10:56.351
- I called the surgeons who
repaired Mr. Kowalski's hernia.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.396
- Bet they called their lawyer
as soon as you hung up.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.747
Wife and kids are downstairs.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.750
She said she tried to get him
to come in over this,
but he kept putting it off.

11:03.793 --> 11:07.623
- Speaking of,
your father's on the board
for his gastrectomy today.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.885
You're welcome to observe.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.321
Obviously, we can't have you
scrubbing in,

11:10.365 --> 11:11.714
but--
- No, thank you.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.761
- Understood.
Better stay busy.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.677
You'll have plenty to do
once your dad's home anyway.

11:18.634 --> 11:19.766
He said how grateful he was

11:19.809 --> 11:21.245
you're willing
to look after him.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.467
- He told you
he was staying with me?

11:25.510 --> 11:29.514
- Pretty sure my wife and
daughter would pay someone
to take me off their hands.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.524
- Urology should be down
as soon as they can.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.483
Okay, any pain here?

11:41.526 --> 11:43.746
[moaning]
- It was way worse
the first time.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.487
- You've dislocated it before?

11:46.401 --> 11:48.664
When?
- Last year.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.840
I was reaching
into the crawlspace.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.842
My husband took one look at it
dangling there

11:52.886 --> 11:55.932
and almost fainted.
Ex-husband I should say.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.674
I'm still not used
to saying that out loud.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.633
Surgery to repair my bladder.

12:01.677 --> 12:04.462
Scale of one-to-ten,
how big a deal is it?

12:04.506 --> 12:07.770
- It's laparoscopic, so recovery
shouldn't be too bad.

12:07.814 --> 12:11.861
But having a friend
or family member around
is always a good idea.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.298
- Thing is,
I just moved to Toronto,

12:14.342 --> 12:16.344
so I don't really know
anyone here yet.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.304
When my husband
quit our marriage,

12:20.348 --> 12:22.393
I quit the office job
I always hated.

12:22.437 --> 12:25.701
Gave myself a year to start over
and open a food truck.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.878
- That's pretty brave.
- Brave and stupid.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.794
I've been driving Uber
to keep things afloat.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.448
- Oh.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.406
Sorry.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.539
Your stitches tore through
your skin.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.671
Have you been
moving around a lot?

12:39.715 --> 12:41.673
- I'm guessing that's not
supposed to happen?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.850
- Don't worry.
I'll re-suture,

12:43.893 --> 12:45.765
and then, uh,
we'll figure it out.

12:47.027 --> 12:49.290
- Why weren't you moving
if the light turned green?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.945
You're always the one honking
to go before it even changes.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.817
- It was green barely a second
before she hit me.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.389
- Good news, your CT came back
negative for any head injury.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.783
- Great, but if she didn't
actually hit her head,

13:03.826 --> 13:04.914
why did you check it?

13:04.958 --> 13:07.917
- He...
He's just being thorough.

13:09.614 --> 13:12.356
- I'll give you guys some space.
- No, please.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.923
What aren't you telling me?

13:14.619 --> 13:15.838
- Nothing.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.318
- Sonja?

13:17.361 --> 13:19.668
- I, um, I passed out earlier.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.452
- You passed out?

13:21.496 --> 13:23.324
In the accident?

13:23.367 --> 13:25.587
- No, when I got here
and I didn't want to tell you

13:25.630 --> 13:27.284
because I didn't want you
to worry.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.810
- Are you using again?

13:30.853 --> 13:33.377
- No, Jason! I swear.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.076
- Then why didn't you tell me
you passed out? Why lie?

13:36.119 --> 13:38.556
- Because I was afraid
you were gonna jump
to this exact conclusion.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.949
- Or because you were high

13:39.993 --> 13:41.559
and that's why you didn't see
the light change.

13:41.603 --> 13:42.865
- No, I wasn't!

13:42.909 --> 13:44.388
I was distracted
for, like, a second

13:44.432 --> 13:45.825
and then she slammed into me!

13:45.868 --> 13:47.870
- You drove the kids
this morning.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.656
Did you get high
and drive the kids?

13:51.700 --> 13:52.919
- No, Jason!

13:52.962 --> 13:55.443
You have to believe me!
- How can I?

13:55.486 --> 13:56.879
After everything
we've been through?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.838
- Because I wouldn't do that--
- Except you have!

13:58.881 --> 14:00.796
When you picked up Tessa
from dance!

14:00.840 --> 14:03.930
- Her carpool got messed up
and she was by herself!

14:03.973 --> 14:05.801
- Excuses! My God!

14:05.845 --> 14:07.934
- Look, I know things
were messed up, Jason!

14:07.977 --> 14:09.936
But I swore to you
I wouldn't do it again!

14:09.979 --> 14:12.895
- But you did! And you knew
this was your last chance!

14:12.939 --> 14:14.592
Gosh, I should have seen it.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.507
You've been distant lately.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.857
Barely present.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.641
- Yeah,
because I've been in pain!

14:19.684 --> 14:21.077
I wasn't using!

14:21.121 --> 14:23.601
I wanted to, Jay, but I didn't!

14:23.645 --> 14:25.865
I didn't even ask the doctor
for painkillers.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.780
- That doesn't mean you didn't
take something before.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.957
That's what you're waiting
for the test results to prove,
right?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.568
- The labs could tell us
a number of different things.

14:33.611 --> 14:36.353
- You promised we were done
with this!

14:37.093 --> 14:38.399
You're out of chances.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.575
- Jason, don't...

14:40.618 --> 14:43.099
Don't do this, just, just--
- Don't come home tonight.

14:43.143 --> 14:46.842
I don't want you
around our kids anymore.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.844
- Jason, wait!

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.982
[moaning]

14:56.025 --> 14:58.854
- I'll get you on fluids.
- I don't need fluids.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.856
- We have resources
that can help you.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.511
There's a detox nurse on staff.
- No!

15:03.554 --> 15:05.034
- I can get you Suboxone
for withdrawal.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.601
- I said no!

15:06.644 --> 15:08.081
I don't want your help.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.039
A doctor like you gave me
pain meds in the first place

15:10.083 --> 15:11.911
and got me into this mess.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.173
- I'm sorry.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.784
I'll be back
with your lab results.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.270
- Dr. Hamed.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.750
Your sister's school called
and it sounded urgent.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.448
- Go.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.711
We'll cover if we have to.
- Thank you.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.846
- I need to add labs
for Navia Khan.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.718
- That's the bladder rupture?
- Yeah.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.502
- Isn't she just waiting
for her Urology consult?

15:38.546 --> 15:39.982
- I know you don't want me
overdiagnosing,

15:40.026 --> 15:41.679
but her stitches tore
right through her skin

15:41.723 --> 15:42.942
despite a lack
of physical motion.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.769
She's also bruising easily--
- Dr. Leblanc.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.815
- No, true,
neither of those things
points to anything concrete,

15:46.858 --> 15:48.773
but something in the way
her bladder ruptured

15:48.817 --> 15:50.210
even without pelvic fracture
was already bothering me--

15:50.253 --> 15:52.560
- I agree!
I read her chart.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.954
Didn't she also have a shoulder
dislocation from the accident?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A history of them, actually.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.914
Do you think that's connected?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.611
- I think you should
look into it.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.788
Keep me in the loop.
- I'll call the lab.

16:04.746 --> 16:08.445
I think you have created
a monster in your own image.

16:08.489 --> 16:11.796
- One day, we are all gonna be
working for Mags.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.019
- Thanks so much for coming in.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.848
We were making family trees
in class.

16:19.891 --> 16:22.807
Amira didn't want to make hers.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.245
I guess her classmate Candace
made a comment

16:25.288 --> 16:28.074
about her not doing one
and things got heated.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.945
Candace started shoving first--

16:29.989 --> 16:32.078
- Are they okay?
- They're both fine.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.602
We asked the girls
to apologize.

16:34.645 --> 16:37.605
Candace did, but Amira said
there was no point

16:37.648 --> 16:39.650
since she'd be going back
to Syria soon anyway.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.262
- I don't know
why she would say that.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.090
She knows it's not true.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.962
- Is anything going on at home

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
that might be affecting
her mood?

16:51.227 --> 16:54.013
- We're moving apartments again,
and...

16:54.056 --> 16:56.015
I know she's not
too thrilled about it,

16:56.058 --> 16:58.060
but maybe it's affecting her
more than I realized.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.236
- At this age,
it's easier for them to hide

17:00.280 --> 17:01.890
when things aren't going well.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.980
Lately, she's been withdrawn,

17:05.023 --> 17:06.634
not turning in assignments--

17:06.676 --> 17:08.156
- So she's not doing
her homework?

17:08.201 --> 17:12.031
- I'm concerned Amira's
holding a lot in.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.515
<i>[patient]:
Give me the blue one, bud.</i>

17:19.167 --> 17:20.517
Thanks.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.519
- Hey!

17:23.128 --> 17:25.131
- I know they said
I should be resting,

17:25.174 --> 17:27.698
but this is the best medicine
that I could hope for.

17:27.742 --> 17:31.224
- Okay, well, I just came
to let you guys know
that everything went well.

17:31.267 --> 17:34.053
We took out the sponges,
and cleared the infected tissue.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.055
- I thought it was indigestion.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.796
I can't believe there was
something rotting inside me.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.538
- He didn't want to have
the hernia surgery either,

17:41.582 --> 17:45.716
but he had been in pain so long,
so I pushed him.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.677
- Emily, hon, you couldn't have
known this would happen.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.679
Help me out here, doc!

17:51.722 --> 17:54.595
- Manny's right. This is
what we call a never event.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.162
As in, it never
should've happened.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.555
- I don't wanna waste any time
dwelling on the negative.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.862
Cameron has his soccer
tournament next weekend.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.211
- You need to take care
of yourself.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.778
Cam and I need you healthy.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.867
- Look, you just
get some rest, okay?

18:05.910 --> 18:07.303
Let your body heal.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.088
And take care of your dad,
alright?

18:09.131 --> 18:10.176
Alright.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.178
I'll check on you guys later.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.744
- Thank you.

18:25.843 --> 18:28.194
- Your teacher tells me
you pushed another student.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.847
- She pushed me first!

18:29.891 --> 18:31.936
- That doesn't mean
you push back.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.851
If you're having issues
at school,

18:33.895 --> 18:35.810
you need to be honest with me.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.075
I know you don't want
to move apartments,

18:40.119 --> 18:41.729
is that why you've been upset?

18:41.772 --> 18:45.298
- If we leave Theo's, it's just
gonna be us again, and...

18:45.341 --> 18:47.996
I won't have anyone to talk to.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.739
- Amira, that's not true.

18:51.782 --> 18:53.175
You can talk to me!

18:53.219 --> 18:54.655
Hmm?

18:55.873 --> 18:59.094
Why don't you tell me what
happened with the family tree?

19:03.011 --> 19:04.926
They called me
in the middle of the day,

19:04.969 --> 19:06.275
telling me that you've been
in a fight,

19:06.319 --> 19:08.103
that you're not
doing your assignments.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.757
And you know you can't go back
to Syria,

19:09.800 --> 19:11.193
why are you telling people
we are?

19:11.237 --> 19:12.934
- Because I wish we were!
I hate it here!

19:12.977 --> 19:14.196
- You hate it here?

19:14.240 --> 19:15.850
You know you are the only
reason we're here!

19:15.893 --> 19:17.199
The only reason I came!

19:17.243 --> 19:18.766
- How could I know that?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.898
You say we should be honest,
but we're not! We never are!

19:27.688 --> 19:29.255
- I'm sorry.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.128
Would you... do you want to come
back to the hospital with me?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.782
- I have detention.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.871
Sorry they bothered you at work.

19:46.315 --> 19:49.492
- Trauma bag has naloxone,
epi, atropine,

19:49.536 --> 19:50.928
and gear for surgical airway.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.322
- Thanks for letting me
tag along to log my hours.

19:53.366 --> 19:56.238
- Yeah, I guess congratulations
are in order.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.761
Have you moved
your family here already?

19:57.805 --> 20:00.329
- We're still, uh,

20:00.373 --> 20:03.506
we're just trying to figure out
how all that's gonna work.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.899
- Well, get ready to test
your mettle.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.339
What's Sudbury,
like four hours by car?

20:10.383 --> 20:12.863
How long do you think
you're gonna be doing
the back-and-forth thing?

20:12.907 --> 20:15.301
- Uh, as long as I need to,
I guess.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.694
- Your wife doesn't wanna
move here?

20:17.738 --> 20:21.220
- I kind of took the offer

20:21.263 --> 20:23.222
before really discussing it
with her.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.701
- Ah, so you're an idiot.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.616
Why did you do that?

20:26.660 --> 20:28.531
- Because I wanted it.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.317
Yeah, I thought I was
taking control of my life,

20:31.360 --> 20:33.841
but I guess I was just--
- Avoiding the conflict.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.713
- Yeah.
I hoped she'd come around,

20:36.757 --> 20:39.455
but she hasn't
and if I walk it back now--

20:39.499 --> 20:40.935
- Hmm, it won't be the same.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.980
She'll always wonder
if you just settled.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.460
- Yeah.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.467
- Hello, sir.
9-1-1 response?

20:51.511 --> 20:54.253
- Are you sure you got
the right address?

20:54.296 --> 20:55.645
- 2319 Berkley.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.560
We got a call about a minor
with a wrist injury?

20:57.604 --> 21:00.389
- A minor with a wrist injury.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.696
Um, I didn't know
that he called. Come on in.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.662
Benjamin!
Can you come down here, please?

21:13.707 --> 21:15.404
Hey, buddy!

21:15.448 --> 21:16.971
Did you call 9-1-1?

21:18.451 --> 21:20.279
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing that?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.671
- Hi, Benjamin!

21:21.715 --> 21:23.847
I'm Joanie.
This is Theo.

21:23.891 --> 21:25.719
- Hi.
- No school today?

21:25.762 --> 21:27.634
- Our school had a PA day.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.592
- Which means since Mom's
out of town,

21:29.636 --> 21:31.333
Dad gets to work
from home today.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.249
- You wanna tell us
what happened here?

21:34.293 --> 21:37.774
- I'd managed to coax him away
from his video games.

21:37.818 --> 21:40.821
And, um, we went outside,
toss the football around,

21:40.864 --> 21:43.693
and after about 10 minutes,
Ben fell on his wrist.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.347
- Ouch.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.697
- Well, can we agree
that calling in the cavalry

21:47.741 --> 21:49.264
was a bit of an overreaction?

21:49.308 --> 21:50.961
I'm sure these two
have more important calls

21:51.005 --> 21:53.355
they should be
responding too, hmm?

21:53.399 --> 21:54.922
- Sorry.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.535
- Actually,
you guys are in luck.

21:59.579 --> 22:02.495
Theo's a pediatrician, so he can
check you out right now

22:02.538 --> 22:04.497
and you may not even need
to go to the hospital.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.325
- Great.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.283
- Yeah, why don't you
take a seat, bud?

22:08.327 --> 22:09.763
- Sir, do you have
your son's health card?

22:09.806 --> 22:11.634
There's some information
I need to note down.

22:11.678 --> 22:12.679
- Uh, yeah.

22:12.722 --> 22:13.941
- You mind if I take a look?

22:13.984 --> 22:15.029
Yeah?

22:16.509 --> 22:18.467
I want you to tell me
where it hurts the most, okay.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.775
- My dad was just trying
to show me how to take a tackle.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.864
He didn't mean
for me to get hurt.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.474
[moaning]

22:25.518 --> 22:29.391
- Now, you've been hurt
playing sports with him before?

22:29.435 --> 22:31.611
- Broke a couple fingers once.

22:31.654 --> 22:32.960
There.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.658
It hurts there the most.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.315
Alright, Benjamin...

22:42.143 --> 22:44.624
Does your dad play
a little rough with you?

22:44.667 --> 22:46.408
No, it's okay.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.410
Some people
just play differently

22:48.454 --> 22:49.977
and they don't realize it.

22:50.020 --> 22:53.372
- He says I need to toughen up.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.035
- Hey, Bash.
Bishop asked me to cover
for your patients.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.472
Said you had to step out.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.038
Are you okay?
Is everything okay?

23:08.082 --> 23:09.605
- Everything's fine.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.695
Did Sonja Jessup's
blood work come back?

23:12.739 --> 23:15.611
- Yes, but not before she left.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.614
A nurse tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't stay.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.443
- I wish she'd change her mind,
let us get her some help.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.707
- Actually, um, she didn't have
any opioids in her system.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.972
- You're saying Sonja
wasn't using?

23:29.016 --> 23:30.670
- Blood work was clean. Yeah.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.370
- I tried treating her
for withdrawal.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.764
I didn't believe her.
No wonder she didn't stay.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.548
- It was a reasonable
assumption to make.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.420
- Yeah, but that means there's
something else wrong with her.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.073
[banging]

23:49.732 --> 23:52.953
[heart monitor beeping]

23:53.954 --> 23:55.434
- What happened?

23:55.477 --> 23:57.000
- A massive embolism.

23:57.044 --> 23:59.438
Clot blocked the blood flow
to his heart.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.091
He arrested immediately.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.833
Code blue team did everything
they could to bring him back,

24:03.877 --> 24:05.966
but nothing.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.663
- There were no warning signs?

24:07.707 --> 24:09.578
- We had him on anti-coags,

24:09.622 --> 24:11.537
but when it's this big
and sudden,

24:11.580 --> 24:12.886
there's nothing we can do.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.413
- His wife and kid.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.588
- I'll talk to them.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.460
- No. I can handle it.
- I know you can.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.766
But you've got enough going on
today with your dad.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.856
He's in recovery.
You can go see him.

24:37.824 --> 24:41.871
[sobbing]

24:49.226 --> 24:51.968
- Looks like we'll have to take
that trip to Memorial after all.

24:52.012 --> 24:54.057
- So, it is broken.

24:54.101 --> 24:57.147
- We need an X-ray to be sure,
but it looks that way.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.236
- Ah.
You'll be okay, Ben.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.022
- We just need to wait
for the police to arrive.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.763
- You called the police?

25:03.806 --> 25:06.679
- They respond
to every 9-1-1 call.
We just got here first.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.508
They'll need you
to give them a statement.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.205
- Okay, about what? His wrist?

25:11.248 --> 25:12.902
- Yes. How it happened.

25:12.946 --> 25:15.035
- I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't know
the police would come.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.123
- It's okay, it's okay.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.603
- I'll tell them
it was an accident!

25:17.646 --> 25:18.995
- Ben! That's enough!

25:19.039 --> 25:22.129
Look, I don't think
there's any need

25:22.172 --> 25:23.696
to make a statement
to the police.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.567
- Well, when a minor's involved,
there is.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.090
- We were just horsing around.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.483
Kids fall all the time.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.093
- Maybe, but the fact is

25:30.137 --> 25:32.095
Benjamin broke his wrist
when you tackled him.

25:32.139 --> 25:34.097
The police are gonna need
to hear what happened.

25:34.141 --> 25:36.578
- Okay. So, if we're gonna
go to the hospital,

25:36.622 --> 25:38.101
then I'm gonna
take him there myself.

25:38.145 --> 25:40.190
Alright?
Let's go, Ben.

25:40.234 --> 25:41.931
- Sir, let's just
wait for the police.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.280
- Get out of my way.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.065
- Dad, don't!
- Quiet!

25:46.719 --> 25:48.285
Move.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.940
I said move!

25:50.984 --> 25:53.813
- You're scaring your son.

25:53.856 --> 25:56.642
Lower your voice
and wait for the police.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.732
- Everything okay in here?

26:01.951 --> 26:03.213
- Is it?

26:04.737 --> 26:05.955
- This is ridiculous.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.959
- Navia Khan has a history
of muscle pain and weakness.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.961
At first,
I worried it could be MS,

26:12.005 --> 26:14.224
but urinalysis
and CBC were negative.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.662
And it wouldn't explain
the ruptured bladder.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.054
- Her bruising is extensive,

26:18.098 --> 26:19.926
but her passenger
didn't sustain any.

26:19.969 --> 26:21.275
- She also has skin atrophy,

26:21.318 --> 26:23.146
which explains
the stitches tearing.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.061
- Did you check for benign
growths on pressure areas,

26:25.105 --> 26:27.760
elbows, knees, or even--
- Heart valve problems?

26:29.805 --> 26:31.677
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.593
- Most cases of Ehlers-Danlos
take years to diagnose.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.160
If you're right,
you saved her a decade

26:37.204 --> 26:38.684
of not knowing
what was wrong with her.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.645
- Sir, this kind of thing--

26:43.689 --> 26:45.995
- Is exactly what I told you
not to get sucked into?

26:46.039 --> 26:47.606
- It's hard to find the line.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.563
- Yeah. I know it is.

26:51.827 --> 26:54.351
- I'll get an echo
and order a skin biopsy

26:54.395 --> 26:56.179
to confirm the diagnosis.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.138
- Good work, Dr. Leblanc.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.662
- 33-year-old woman
collapsed in a coffee shop!

27:00.706 --> 27:02.011
She was unconscious
when we arrived.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.883
We administered Naloxone
at the scene.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.232
- Sonja Jessup.

27:05.275 --> 27:06.668
She overdosed?

27:06.712 --> 27:08.061
Do we know what she took?

27:08.104 --> 27:09.889
- BP's dropping.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.238
Heart rate's 145.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.370
- She's in V-Tach.
- She shouldn't be.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.808
I mean, heart rate decreases
after an overdose.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.244
Isn't this your
car accident victim

27:17.287 --> 27:18.898
that walked out AMA
this morning?

27:18.941 --> 27:20.769
- She lost consciousness
during the physical exam

27:20.813 --> 27:23.598
and her resp rate was low,
but she wasn't on opioids then.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.255
Muffled heart sounds. Scan!

27:40.267 --> 27:41.877
- Cardiac tamponade.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.139
- She needs
a pericardiocentesis.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.663
We need to drain the fluid
around her heart.

27:44.706 --> 27:45.707
- Okay. Do it.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.187
- I need an 18 gauge 7cm needle

27:47.230 --> 27:48.710
with a 30CC syringe.

27:48.754 --> 27:49.929
- Got it.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.110
- I see the trajectory.

27:57.153 --> 27:58.938
Claire, keep the field in view.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.635
- Use the subside forward
approach.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.116
And aim towards
the left shoulder.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.732
- SATS are falling.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.255
- I don't feel it yet.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.388
- Go easy.
You're not quite in.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.701
- Got it.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.320
- She's stabilizing.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.332
- I let her leave.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.291
This is on me.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.260
- She's stable now.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.436
Okay? Here.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.568
- This is what I've been
dreading.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.789
This is my worst nightmare.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.881
- Jason,
you should also know that...

29:12.925 --> 29:16.406
there were no opioids
in her system this morning.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.279
- You're saying...

29:19.322 --> 29:22.238
she wasn't high
when she drove the kids?

29:23.370 --> 29:25.285
Well that means,

29:25.328 --> 29:28.810
she only went and used
after I accused her?

29:31.204 --> 29:32.771
This is my fault!

29:33.815 --> 29:35.817
I told her not to come home!

29:35.861 --> 29:38.689
She could've died!
- But she didn't.

29:41.257 --> 29:44.391
She's sedated right now, but
you'll be able to see her soon.

29:44.434 --> 29:45.827
Okay?

29:50.745 --> 29:52.486
- It wasn't the car accident

29:52.529 --> 29:54.314
that caused my bladder
to rupture?

29:54.357 --> 29:56.229
It was this other thing?

29:56.272 --> 29:58.840
- Well, it was a combination
of the two things,

29:58.884 --> 30:01.495
but if you hadn't been
in the car accident,

30:01.538 --> 30:03.192
we may never have found out,

30:03.236 --> 30:04.324
because it meant
several of your symptoms

30:04.367 --> 30:05.455
presented at once.

30:05.499 --> 30:06.674
- And this condition.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.676
Ehlers-Danlos?

30:08.719 --> 30:10.809
Is it serious?
- It can be.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.637
Your joints dislocate
more often.

30:13.681 --> 30:15.248
You bruise easily.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.773
You might experience
extreme muscle pain,

30:18.817 --> 30:20.688
or be prone to ruptured organs,

30:20.731 --> 30:21.994
like your bladder.

30:22.037 --> 30:24.910
But the good news is
it's not degenerative,

30:24.953 --> 30:27.390
so it's not gonna get worse.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.916
But there's no cure.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.355
- So I'll have it forever?

30:35.398 --> 30:36.704
- I'm sorry, Navia.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.662
I know it's not...

30:38.706 --> 30:41.491
It's not what
you were expecting to hear.

30:41.535 --> 30:44.364
- I convinced myself
I was strong enough

30:44.407 --> 30:47.497
to throw everything out
and start this big adventure.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.891
And now, you're telling me
I'm broken,

30:49.935 --> 30:52.894
fragile, and there's nothing
I can do about it?

30:52.938 --> 30:54.722
- You can be prepared.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.376
Watch for any warning signs.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.465
Be more careful in your
day-to-day activities.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.249
- I never should have left home.

31:01.685 --> 31:04.297
Now I'm alone with this.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.564
- Hey, Ben.

31:10.607 --> 31:11.913
How's your arm?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.786
I heard your mom's
on her way back.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.398
- They said my Dad might not get
to come home tonight.

31:18.441 --> 31:20.443
It's all my fault.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.577
- Ben, none of this
is your fault.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.840
- If I was tougher,
this wouldn't be happening!

31:27.320 --> 31:29.757
- When your dad plays rough
with you like that,

31:29.800 --> 31:31.367
it's not okay.

31:31.411 --> 31:34.327
It has nothing to do
with how tough you are.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.505
[crying]

31:46.426 --> 31:48.602
- The father's
a real piece of work.

31:48.645 --> 31:51.692
Insists the kid
just landed wrong.

31:51.735 --> 31:54.477
- Ben landed where his dad
tackled him.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.001
And he's pretty upset about it.

31:56.044 --> 31:57.741
Thinks he's got his dad
into trouble.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.004
- His dad got himself
into trouble.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.571
Let's hope he smartens
himself up.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.360
Last chance to back out.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.974
Welcome to the team.

32:29.599 --> 32:33.342
[television playing]

32:35.649 --> 32:38.652
- Why did you tell Singh
you were coming to stay with me?

32:38.695 --> 32:40.001
- I'm fine.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.830
Thanks for asking.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.658
- Yeah, I know.
I checked your chart.

32:44.701 --> 32:46.965
- It got your attention,
didn't it?

32:48.053 --> 32:49.489
- You're unbelievable.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.012
- I...

32:52.448 --> 32:54.973
I hoped you might say yes,
okay?

32:55.016 --> 32:57.018
I know you hate me.

32:58.063 --> 33:01.849
That you haven't forgiven me
for my mistakes.

33:03.938 --> 33:06.027
I'm all alone here, June.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.594
- Don't put that on me.

33:07.637 --> 33:09.030
You're alone
because you've hurt everyone

33:09.074 --> 33:10.553
who's ever cared about you.

33:10.597 --> 33:11.902
- Yeah.

33:12.686 --> 33:13.992
You're right.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.915
- You know, I'm stronger
than I used to be.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.571
I'm not just gonna let you
do that to me again.

33:28.615 --> 33:31.139
- I don't wanna hurt you, June.

33:32.836 --> 33:33.968
I wanna be in your life.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.798
- Every time I let you in,
I'm the one who ends up paying.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.713
[sighing]

33:39.756 --> 33:42.977
- Maybe it was like that before,
but now--

33:43.021 --> 33:46.067
- You know,
you say you've changed,
but you lied to my boss!

33:46.111 --> 33:49.897
You lied to my boss
to get me to talk to you?

33:49.940 --> 33:53.074
- Okay, that was, um,
that was a mistake.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.729
I can do better.
- I don't think you can.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.122
And even if you could,

33:57.165 --> 33:59.950
I don't think I can give you
another chance, so...

34:02.127 --> 34:03.954
[crying]

34:10.004 --> 34:11.831
So, uh..

34:12.702 --> 34:14.748
You know, Dr. Singh's
a great doctor.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.489
And if you need
anything at home,

34:16.532 --> 34:18.491
I will find you a nurse.

34:19.969 --> 34:20.928
- But that's all.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.933
- You know, I've see all kinds,
working here.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.850
All kinds of love.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.812
Seen people lose families
and find families.

34:37.858 --> 34:39.120
But that's just not who we are.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.866
[coughing]

34:50.175 --> 34:51.654
- Hi.

34:53.743 --> 34:56.616
Your husband was just here.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.706
- He's making arrangements
for the kids.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.754
- I...

35:04.798 --> 35:07.148
I didn't believe you,
Sonja.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.498
I'm... I'm sorry.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.548
- Turns out
you were right not to.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.074
- You stopped once.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.684
You can stop again.

35:21.728 --> 35:24.557
- Yeah, but the pain
never goes away.

35:27.037 --> 35:29.649
One bad moment
sends me over the edge.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.914
I know my family keeps hoping
that this is over, but...

35:35.785 --> 35:37.874
...it's never over.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.051
Now, when I look at my life,

35:41.095 --> 35:43.706
all I see is this void.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.536
This giant void.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.541
- You have to face it.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.589
- What if I can't?

36:00.245 --> 36:02.551
What if I'm not strong enough?

36:04.814 --> 36:06.294
- But you are.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.437
[phone chiming]

36:32.146 --> 36:33.191
- Hey!

36:33.234 --> 36:35.497
You're back?
- Yeah.

36:36.629 --> 36:39.675
I went to this party, but...

36:39.719 --> 36:42.504
I can't stop thinking
about my patient.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.680
I told her she had
Ehlers-Danlos today,

36:44.724 --> 36:46.378
and she took it pretty hard.

36:47.161 --> 36:48.771
I came back, because...

36:48.815 --> 36:52.210
- Because you're Mags,
so what do you do?

36:54.342 --> 36:55.778
- Yeah.

37:04.744 --> 37:05.701
Hi.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.573
- Hi.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.705
- I heard your surgery
went well.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.751
You should be going home
tomorrow.

37:12.491 --> 37:13.883
- They said you were gone.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.320
- Yeah.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.288
I know what it's like.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.769
Feeling fragile.

37:29.812 --> 37:34.121
And questioning what you're...
what you're capable of.

37:36.428 --> 37:39.431
- I left everything I knew
to come here.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.217
Follow my passion. And now...

37:43.652 --> 37:45.524
- You'll make some adjustments.

37:46.394 --> 37:49.354
The only way to know how
is to try.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.624
So tell me about
your food truck.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.236
- Seriously?

38:02.280 --> 38:04.499
- I don't know that much
about food trucks,

38:04.543 --> 38:06.284
other than I like eating
at them!

38:07.807 --> 38:10.288
But I've got
nowhere else to be,

38:10.331 --> 38:12.377
and I'd love to learn more,

38:12.420 --> 38:14.466
if you want the company.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.469
- Okay.

38:20.385 --> 38:23.301
Well, when I was eight...
- Mm-hmm?

38:23.344 --> 38:26.565
- My parents used to take me
travelling, a lot...

38:27.740 --> 38:29.916
- June, I've been calling you!

38:29.959 --> 38:31.570
I thought we had dinner plans!

38:31.613 --> 38:33.311
- Yeah, I just figured
you were still mad.

38:33.354 --> 38:34.834
- Yeah, so, we hash it out.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.662
That's how this works, right?

38:39.665 --> 38:41.319
- I think we should end this.

38:42.668 --> 38:45.410
- Okay, whoa,
where did that come from?

38:45.453 --> 38:47.194
- You were right, Lou.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.240
I don't let you in.

38:50.284 --> 38:52.939
Not you or anyone. I can't.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.289
- If this is about your dad--
- It's about me.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.900
It's about me, alright?

38:57.944 --> 38:59.641
Maybe it's because of him,

38:59.685 --> 39:01.687
or maybe it's who I always was,

39:01.730 --> 39:03.645
but I'm not good at this.

39:03.689 --> 39:08.824
And I'm just gonna hurt you.
- You're not him, June.

39:08.868 --> 39:11.914
This kind of stuff
takes practice, right?

39:14.352 --> 39:15.483
Don't do this.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.269
- You deserve better.

39:21.271 --> 39:22.751
- June, wait!

39:25.275 --> 39:26.886
Please.
- I'm sorry!

39:41.509 --> 39:43.381
- You wanted to see me,
Dr. Bishop?

39:43.424 --> 39:44.730
- Yeah, come in.
Close the door.

39:49.822 --> 39:52.694
- About Sonja Jessup, um,
it was my fault.

39:52.738 --> 39:56.481
She left before we could--
- Ah, we can't keep patients
here against their will.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.875
What happened with Amira?
Was everything okay?

39:59.919 --> 40:02.922
- Uh, yeah,
there was some drama at school,

40:02.965 --> 40:05.011
but, uh, she's fine.

40:06.621 --> 40:09.581
There was an incident
with another student.

40:10.451 --> 40:11.713
I tried talking to her,

40:11.757 --> 40:13.846
but I guess I'm saying
all the wrong things.

40:15.369 --> 40:16.544
- She's 12?

40:17.458 --> 40:19.025
When my son was 12...

40:20.853 --> 40:22.768
It gets harder.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.857
Knowing what to say.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.469
Main thing is, you're there
when she needs you.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.864
That's a lesson
I learned too late.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.474
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.564
- Thank you.

40:36.608 --> 40:39.393
[pager beeping]

40:40.525 --> 40:42.831
It's ICU.
Sonja Jessup is crashing.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.749
- SATS are low,
but her heart rate
is through the roof again.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.055
- Get her on a non-rebreather.

40:49.098 --> 40:51.057
Dr. Hamed,
let's get eyes in her chest.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.667
Have we got
her blood work back?

40:52.711 --> 40:53.973
- Not yet!

40:54.016 --> 40:56.018
- So we still don't know
what we're dealing with.

41:01.067 --> 41:03.461
- Massive pleural effusion.

41:03.504 --> 41:06.725
- Sonja, you have fluid
on your lungs.

41:06.768 --> 41:10.119
We're going to put a chest tube
in to help you breathe.

41:10.163 --> 41:11.599
Alright?

41:11.643 --> 41:12.861
We'll take good care of you.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.391
Okay.

41:21.435 --> 41:22.480
- Scalpel.

41:23.829 --> 41:25.831
Making primary incision.

Performing blood dissection
through the muscle in fashion.

41:46.808 --> 41:48.375
Chest tube.

41:50.464 --> 41:52.510
Inserting chest tube.
- Mm-hmm.

42:00.126 --> 42:02.432
- Guide me through placement.

42:03.564 --> 42:06.393
- A millimeter left.
Just a millimiter.

42:09.222 --> 42:11.398
- I can't feel
the pleural space.

42:11.441 --> 42:12.747
Am I close?

42:17.230 --> 42:18.927
Sir?

42:18.971 --> 42:20.581
- Dr. Bishop?

42:23.628 --> 42:25.107
- Keep going.

42:25.151 --> 42:26.587
- Okay.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.115
- What?
- I think I nicked something.

42:33.159 --> 42:34.595
- Guys?

42:34.639 --> 42:36.597
- Placement was wrong.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.033
I think I perforated an organ.

42:38.077 --> 42:39.469
- We've got a bleed.

42:39.513 --> 42:41.820
Ease out, nice and slow.

42:41.863 --> 42:43.691
Slowly. Slowly.

42:43.735 --> 42:45.084
- SATS are falling!

42:45.127 --> 42:46.912
- He's gonna need a new tube,
Claire.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.046
- Pressure's dropping.

42:52.874 --> 42:54.746
- There's free fluid
in the abdomen.

42:54.789 --> 42:57.009
Her spleen is ruptured.

42:57.052 --> 42:59.185
Activate massive transfusion
protocol!

42:59.228 --> 43:00.708
Get me another chest tube!

43:00.752 --> 43:02.536
- Call for blood!
