WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:04.656
If you wanna come home
with me.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.745
- Dad's dying, Junie.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.530
They say in six months.

00:08.573 --> 00:12.229
- You always chose someone
who withholds validation,

00:12.273 --> 00:14.840
or someone
who worships you.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.886
- I think you should do
the ablation.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.105
- You said it could kill him.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.454
- Mags you lived their reality.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.456
You know what that little boy
is going through.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.067
- I've been asked to meet
candidates

00:24.111 --> 00:25.895
and lead the transition
to a new chief.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.418
- You're being pushed out?

00:27.462 --> 00:29.507
- Ray Grisholm has filed
a malpractice suit

00:29.551 --> 00:31.727
for his daughter having
to be mechanically ventilated

00:31.770 --> 00:34.077
for the rest of her life.
- Tell me what I can do,

00:34.121 --> 00:36.166
to manage this.
- You can play it safe.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.038
Toe the line.

00:43.913 --> 00:47.090
[muffled voices]

00:59.102 --> 01:00.408
- Bashir?

01:00.451 --> 01:02.758
- What could they possibly be
doing up there?

01:02.801 --> 01:04.542
- I still say vampires.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.501
It's why you never see them
in the day.

01:06.544 --> 01:09.591
- Last month it was three
roommates, this month it's four.

01:09.634 --> 01:13.073
- The new one's a victim,
they're up all night
torturing him.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.552
- It's every night now,
Amira.

01:14.596 --> 01:17.207
This is our home too and
we deserve quiet.

01:17.251 --> 01:20.210
- Bashir!
- We can't sit around
and do nothing.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.431
- What if we get in trouble...

01:24.127 --> 01:25.911
- We won't.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.652
Okay, just go back to sleep.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.104
[sighing]

01:44.843 --> 01:47.585
[loud footsteps]

01:49.152 --> 01:52.199
[gentle music]

02:04.211 --> 02:06.430
[siren in the distance]

02:06.474 --> 02:09.607
- Advancing the first catheter
through the tricuspid valve.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.131
Dr. Leblanc?

02:11.174 --> 02:12.784
- His temperature's
a little elevated...

02:12.828 --> 02:14.569
- Keep an eye on it.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.312
Okay, we're in.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.227
- BP's down 60/40.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.273
- His pre-op white cell count
was high-end of normal.

02:23.317 --> 02:26.407
Any further worsening
of his clinical status and
we'll have to stop.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.801
- His heart rate's been
escalating every few hours.

02:29.845 --> 02:33.022
We need to eliminate the pathway
causing the SVT's now.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.806
[beeping]
- Mags?

02:34.850 --> 02:37.069
- Dammit. Temp's 39.
Too high.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.636
He must have an infection.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.377
- We can't continue if
he's febrile.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.074
Extracting the catheter.

02:42.118 --> 02:45.600
Tell the parents
we'll deal with the infection
and try again.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.044
- Anyone have time for
a differential?

02:55.087 --> 02:58.003
- Gotta shower, reno guys
demolished the kitchen
in my new place,

02:58.047 --> 02:59.483
just didn't hook up
the water.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.224
- You don't have running water?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.183
- They'll be back, obviously.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.272
- What do you need?
- Four people.

03:05.315 --> 03:09.406
Same neighbourhood.
Fever, cramping, weight loss
and joint pain.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.321
- Travel history?
- None.

03:11.365 --> 03:12.975
The symptom showed up
a month ago.

03:13.715 --> 03:14.933
- Lyme disease?

03:14.977 --> 03:17.153
- Four tick bites seems
unlikely.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.329
- Same neighbourhood,
any family connection?

03:19.373 --> 03:22.202
- That's the strange part,
they barely know each other.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.682
- It's not enough information
to go off of...

03:24.726 --> 03:26.075
Let me guess,
the lab's backed up?

03:26.118 --> 03:28.556
- Actually they aren't
near one.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.906
They're in a village
in the outskirts of Aleppo.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.345
- Any chance it's chemical?
- No, not that.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.695
- So it has to be viral.
Age range?

03:37.739 --> 03:42.874
- Healthy young adults,
the symptoms are getting
more severe.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.615
- I'll keep thinking.

03:46.487 --> 03:51.448
If the joint pain is knee
and sacroiliac,

03:51.492 --> 03:53.755
it could be bacterial
arthritis.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.060
- Right. Thanks!

03:55.104 --> 03:57.237
- You know that you make
the rest of us feel like

03:57.280 --> 03:59.108
self-focused jerks, right?

03:59.151 --> 04:01.371
- Yeah, I'll work on that.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.766
- Thanks again, Hugh.

04:04.809 --> 04:07.551
We'll be in touch once
we're closer to a decision.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.249
- Excuse me?

04:09.292 --> 04:10.815
They told me
to sit tight, but...

04:10.859 --> 04:13.557
I'm pretty sure something's
about to burst inside me...

04:13.601 --> 04:16.690
- Well, can you tell me where
the pain is?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.171
Yeah, and how long has this
been going on?

04:19.214 --> 04:20.825
Hello?

04:20.869 --> 04:22.653
Claire, I need hands.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.568
Nurse, get a gurney,
we need some help.

04:24.612 --> 04:27.310
- What do we have here?
- Tonic clonic seizure.

04:27.354 --> 04:30.226
We need to protect his head,
okay.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.010
- He's breathing well.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.361
- He was complaining of stomach
cramps before he collapsed.

04:34.404 --> 04:37.015
- Appendix?
- Pain was on the left side.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.887
- I can feel distention...

04:38.930 --> 04:41.019
Possible obstruction,
or perforation?

04:41.063 --> 04:42.717
- Bowel sounds?

04:43.370 --> 04:45.589
- Present.
So unlikely obstruction.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.462
Okay, I'll alert an OR
until we get imaging.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.684
- It's Theo.

04:53.728 --> 04:57.601
Just wondering about us
reconnecting?

04:57.645 --> 04:59.951
Whenever you're available?

05:00.561 --> 05:03.433
Theo Hunter.
Okay...

05:03.477 --> 05:05.305
- It's your med student's
last week.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.002
Can we discuss your evaluation?

05:07.045 --> 05:08.960
- Yeah, sure. You read it?

05:09.004 --> 05:12.007
- I have to sign off before it
goes to his program director.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.096
It's generous.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.185
Is it how you really feel?

05:16.925 --> 05:20.363
- I mean, I know he's in over
his head a lot but...

05:20.407 --> 05:23.540
he's a nice kid.
- Nice doesn't save lives.

05:23.584 --> 05:26.761
Honest and unmerciful
is the only way to learn.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.635
[in Arabic]:

06:10.065 --> 06:12.937
- Brian's lucky Bishop caught
him in the waiting room.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.375
Poor guy thought he was eating
a mushroom,

06:15.418 --> 06:17.768
turned out to be a screw
from the frying pan.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.466
[chuckles]

06:20.510 --> 06:22.338
Guess he's not much of
a chewer.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.472
- Ready to irrigate.
- At ease, Dr. Curtis.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.256
When I need you, you'll know.

06:27.778 --> 06:30.172
It looked like a single perf
from the imaging,

06:30.215 --> 06:33.958
but then we open him up
and the screw perforated
three places in the ileum.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.569
Scissors?

06:36.918 --> 06:40.225
That's one birthday dinner
he won't forget.

06:40.269 --> 06:43.011
Alright, June,
this is your big moment.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.752
Now you can irrigate.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.582
Okay, let's milk the bowel.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.888
Anybody see bubbles?

06:50.932 --> 06:53.717
Good, no leaks means
a happy surgeon.

06:53.761 --> 06:57.112
Alright, let's close.
- Uh, I think I see a leak.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.158
- You think or you know?
- I know.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.773
- Well, there it is.

07:05.816 --> 07:09.037
This won't save Brian
from getting an ileostomy,

07:09.080 --> 07:11.474
but you managed to show me up
in a room full of surgeons.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.128
Congrats.

07:16.827 --> 07:20.004
- He's alright.
Just, don't worry.

07:20.048 --> 07:23.225
I will call you later, okay?
I love you.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.923
Please tell me you're ready
to try again, Mags.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.187
- Ollie is responding
to antibiotics.

07:29.231 --> 07:33.191
There is a chance Dr. Fisher
might think he's ready today,

07:33.235 --> 07:35.672
but we're not there yet.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.109
- In the meantime, he's had
another two SVT episodes!

07:38.153 --> 07:39.763
- I know.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.374
- How much longer
can he hold out?

07:42.418 --> 07:44.594
- I know how stressful this is.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.118
Ollie's infection came out
of left field.

07:47.162 --> 07:50.470
- I just want one thing to go
right for him...

07:51.296 --> 07:54.299
- Was that Gary? How's he doing?
How's he holding up?

07:54.343 --> 07:57.912
- Oh, he isn't, so I sent him
back home to Timmins.

07:57.955 --> 08:01.611
At least there he can be with
our other kids.

08:01.655 --> 08:06.660
He tried to argue,
but he's probably relieved.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.401
- You shouldn't be alone
with this.

08:09.445 --> 08:13.580
- Well, him panicking
is just another thing that
I have to manage...

08:13.623 --> 08:15.451
You know, so...

08:15.495 --> 08:18.715
He can't handle this,
so I have to.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.850
I have to.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.203
[siren blaring]

08:30.248 --> 08:33.121
- Push 5 milligrams morphine.
- What do we have?

08:33.164 --> 08:36.951
- Remi Bellcourt,
29-year-old female injured
in an apartment fire

08:36.994 --> 08:38.822
after an outlet shorted.
Breathing well.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.693
Burns to her left shoulder
and both arms.

08:40.736 --> 08:42.957
Help me get her up,
so I can a look at her back.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.263
- Remi, we're going to lift
you up, okay?

08:45.307 --> 08:46.438
One, two, three...

08:46.482 --> 08:47.831
[moaning]

08:47.875 --> 08:49.833
- You need to check out
Evan too!

08:49.877 --> 08:51.792
- Babe, I'm fine.
It's you I'm worried about.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.185
Her bedroom lit up and she was
trying to coax her tabby

08:54.229 --> 08:55.709
out of the closet.
She wouldn't leave him.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.233
- Evan saved us both.
- And back down.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.669
One, two, three.

08:59.713 --> 09:02.063
Rule of nines,
10 % surface area burned,

09:02.106 --> 09:03.151
all partial thickness.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.022
- Let's get her new
wet dressings

09:05.066 --> 09:06.458
and increase her IV.

09:06.502 --> 09:09.244
That's one 25 cc per hour
for the first eight hours.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.854
- Are you sure you don't require
medical attention?

09:10.898 --> 09:12.943
- No, I didn't get burned.
I came back from a run

09:12.987 --> 09:14.728
and I saw the smoke
in the apartment.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.643
I live a floor up,
it's how we met.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.688
- Okay, free fluid
in her belly.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.603
Trauma from an impact wound.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.519
I'm ordering a CT
and calling OR.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.478
- What does that mean?
- Remi, you're going
to need a surgery

09:26.522 --> 09:29.220
to fix your internal bleeding.
And likely another procedure

09:29.264 --> 09:31.788
called a debridement
to treat your burns...

09:32.397 --> 09:34.269
- Another incoming,
same fire.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.619
- I thought they said
it was contained to my unit!

09:36.663 --> 09:39.448
Did someone else get hurt?
- Go. I've got this.

09:39.796 --> 09:42.103
[intense music]

09:45.672 --> 09:48.196
- I'm Dr. Hamed,
can you tell me what happened?

09:48.239 --> 09:49.893
- I was... asleep.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.635
Heard the smoke alarm,
but it goes off

09:52.679 --> 09:55.333
anytime somebody
burns toast, so...

09:55.377 --> 09:56.813
I guess I ignored it?

09:56.857 --> 10:00.382
Next thing I know,
two firemen are shaking me.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.905
- Okay, try to save
your breath...

10:01.949 --> 10:04.821
- BP's high. 150 over 95.
Elevated heart rate.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.780
- Possible smoke inhalation.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.086
Can you open your mouth
so I can check your throat?

10:10.479 --> 10:11.872
Are you feeling dizzy?

10:11.915 --> 10:13.613
Okay, let's increase
her oxygen.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.702
- Cora!
What's wrong with her?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.268
- Hey!
You shouldn't be here.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.531
- Baby, there you are...

10:19.575 --> 10:21.751
I came to surprise you
with breakfast.

10:21.795 --> 10:25.102
You were on your run,
so I got into bed and waited.

10:25.146 --> 10:28.062
But you never came...
- I'm here now, Cora, I'm here.

10:34.242 --> 10:35.678
- The kid with the wrist?

10:35.722 --> 10:38.463
By the time I got here,
things were, uh, weird.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.771
- You spaced and drove through
a stop sign on the way here!

10:41.815 --> 10:45.035
- And I am playing catch-up.
I thought this was just a fall?

10:45.079 --> 10:46.428
- More like a kamikaze maneuver.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.648
Ava leapt off our deck,
teaching herself parkour.

10:48.691 --> 10:51.346
- I missed one step, he's been
missing lots of things!

10:51.389 --> 10:53.827
- Ava won't let me see
her wrist unless

10:53.870 --> 10:56.481
her father answers
some questions about
his own health.

10:56.525 --> 10:59.441
- She's worked up about nothing.
Look, her friends' dads are 45.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.617
I'm 65, which means
you forget things.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.706
- Does it also mean leaving
the stove on all night?

11:03.750 --> 11:06.143
Or letting my frog go hungry
while I'm on a band trip?

11:06.187 --> 11:07.797
- When did you become
such a tyrant?

11:07.841 --> 11:11.366
- I say there's a deal that
can be made here.

11:11.888 --> 11:15.065
Ava gets X-rays, Dad gets his
blood pressure read.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.893
Any takers?

11:17.459 --> 11:19.330
- Fine, but he goes first.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.463
Tell him about
the headache too.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.291
- Nothing abnormal about
a headache.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.945
- Even if you've had it
for a week?

11:24.988 --> 11:26.816
And nothing takes it away?

11:27.599 --> 11:30.951
- Is it that high?
- It's very high, sir.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.257
Jake's going to take Ava
to get X-rays

11:33.301 --> 11:34.824
and I'm gonna get you
set up an EKG.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.479
- Is that serious?
I'm not leaving him if it is.

11:37.522 --> 11:40.308
- Oh, hey now, kiddo:
we made a deal.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.789
Let me and Dr. Hunter
handle this, okay?

11:43.790 --> 11:45.356
[sighing]

11:46.531 --> 11:49.056
- Someone from OR should be down
shortly to come get you, Remi.

11:49.099 --> 11:52.450
They're just coordinating
between general surgery
and the burn unit.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.888
How's your pain level?
- It's okay.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.759
Morphine helps.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.108
- Why don't you rest,

11:58.152 --> 12:00.371
while I talk to Dr. Hamed
outside?

12:10.294 --> 12:12.253
How long will
the morphine last?

12:12.296 --> 12:14.342
I need to check on Cora.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.562
- Evan, I--
- I know how this looks.

12:17.606 --> 12:20.391
But, I was dating Remi first.
And she's amazing.

12:20.435 --> 12:23.525
She's smart, funny and tough,
a force of nature.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.484
Then, I met Cora by accident
at this friend's party.

12:26.528 --> 12:30.010
And she's so sweet and generous
and supportive.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.447
How long will Remi be
in surgery?

12:32.490 --> 12:34.623
- Evan, if you're asking me
to help you divide your time

12:34.666 --> 12:36.756
between the two of them I...
- I love them both.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.148
They need me.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.934
- What they need is to focus
on their recoveries.

12:40.977 --> 12:44.807
- Which means it's better
if they don't find out, right?

12:44.851 --> 12:46.504
- That's up to you.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.554
Salim, where are you?

12:52.597 --> 12:54.643
- Aren't you done
for the day?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.384
- Uh, almost.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.560
I had an idea.
- Yeah, me too.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.823
Send Cora Maxwell
up to ICU.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.870
I want her closely monitored in
case of delayed tracheal edema.

13:03.913 --> 13:08.048
- The other fire victim,
she needs surgical debridement,

13:08.091 --> 13:11.051
the longer we wait,
the more we increase
the risk of infection.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.618
- And you want to debride her
here rather than waiting
on an OR?

13:13.662 --> 13:15.664
- I could ask plastics
to assist.

13:15.707 --> 13:18.928
This is the sort of things
you want us to be able
to handle, right?

13:18.972 --> 13:22.062
- Not you, not with this lawsuit
hanging over you.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.630
But there is one thing
you can do for me.

13:25.674 --> 13:29.025
- Wasn't fair, Roche chewing
you out for being right.

13:29.983 --> 13:33.682
- Yeah, well, my crime was
being right in public.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.555
- 60-year-old stomach cancer
outpatient

13:37.599 --> 13:39.340
waiting on a feeding tube.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.603
He actually has the same
last name as you.

13:45.259 --> 13:48.828
- Yeah, I always wanted a less
common last name, growing up.

13:48.871 --> 13:52.048
You think you could assist
Roche on that one?

13:52.092 --> 13:54.050
Maybe try not correcting
her though.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.579
- You're mad because I didn't
tell you we were here?

14:01.623 --> 14:03.668
Because for weeks, June,
you've been telling me
specifically

14:03.712 --> 14:06.019
not to tell you these things.
- Charles, it's my job

14:06.062 --> 14:09.152
to schedule the exact type
of surgery our father's
supposed to be getting.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.285
And it just so happens that
the surgeon who's supposed

14:11.328 --> 14:12.939
to give it to him
hates me.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.898
So yeah, a little heads-up
would've been nice.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.119
- Wow, the fact that our dad
needs a feeding tube

14:19.162 --> 14:20.772
is totally ancillary to you,
isn't it?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.949
- I don't know what to tell you,
I was raised by a narcissist.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.168
- Speaking of which,
the first thing he asked
when he got admitted

14:25.212 --> 14:28.737
was if I could talk you into
getting him a private room.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.521
Relax, relax.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.523
I'm just telling you
so I can tell him I did.

14:32.567 --> 14:35.962
And you're right, I should have
warned you, I'm sorry.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.921
I know you don't want this
following you here.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.882
- Can we just, stay out
of each other's way?

14:44.100 --> 14:45.885
- Whatever you say,
Dr. Curtis.

14:47.451 --> 14:50.063
[indistinct chatter on PA]

14:51.891 --> 14:54.241
- I know how much
you missed me, but...

14:54.284 --> 14:57.331
are you sure this girl
was in a fire?

14:57.374 --> 14:58.854
- She wasn't exactly in one.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.682
She was asleep
in the unit above one.

15:00.725 --> 15:04.251
- 'Cause there's no sign
of smoke inhalation
on her bronchoscopy.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.384
And her O2 sat's sitting
at a healthy 98.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.691
She is very short of breath.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.867
- BP's too high for
anaphylaxis.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.826
- You know, most emerg
physicians completely forget

15:14.870 --> 15:17.394
about their patients the moment
they send them into ICU.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.008
- Dr. Novak, I wanted to ask
if you're aware

15:22.051 --> 15:24.880
of Dr. Bishop's proposal
to open a trauma OR?

15:24.924 --> 15:28.231
- I'm aware that he wants
to divert funding

15:28.275 --> 15:31.278
and expend the kinds
of interventions
you can do in emerg.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.714
- "We" can do, yes.

15:33.758 --> 15:37.632
- It's a shame he's gotta grovel
to make himself indispensable.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.069
The business of medicine
is cruel.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.202
- Dr. Bishop is looking
to build consensus.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.900
It would help him
to have your support
as an ICU division head.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.815
- Oh, is that why you're here?
As a whip,

15:46.858 --> 15:50.036
because the old man was too
afraid to confront me himself?

15:50.079 --> 15:52.299
Young, healthy woman.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.475
No smoke inhalation,
elevated BP.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.390
They say where there's smoke
there's fire.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.044
We just have to find it.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.480
- We?

15:59.523 --> 16:01.612
- Unless you have more
exciting plans.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.789
- And every time we think
he's ready, his temp spikes
or his BP drops.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.704
And his fathers
are falling apart,

16:06.748 --> 16:09.229
and there is nothing I can say
or do to make it better

16:09.272 --> 16:10.970
in anyway or like--
What?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.668
- Nothing I just think
I'm gonna have to start
cross-training

16:13.711 --> 16:15.583
to keep up with you.
[chuckling]

16:15.626 --> 16:17.759
- It's just, I pushed them
into this, you know?

16:17.802 --> 16:20.588
- Yeah, well Fisher
makes the final calls.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.764
So, you're doing
everything you can.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.461
- Yeah, but that's not
the point. They trust me.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.290
I need to figure out
a way to like, get them
through this...

16:27.334 --> 16:29.379
- Hey, I'm not telling you
not to care.

16:29.423 --> 16:33.166
I'm saying it's okay
to let yourself off the hook
for a minute.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.429
I'm gonna tell you
a bad joke.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.997
I'm gonna tell you a bad joke,
and it's gonna clear your head.

16:38.040 --> 16:42.088
Why did the dermatologist
get fired from his job?

16:43.002 --> 16:46.831
Because he was making
too many rash decisions!

16:46.875 --> 16:48.442
[mimics drums]

16:48.485 --> 16:50.835
It's a bad joke.
- I just don't...

16:50.879 --> 16:53.012
I don't want
to clear my head.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.848
- With me, Bashir!
- What happened?

17:03.892 --> 17:05.546
- Not sure,
they just paged me.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.113
- She passed out!

17:08.505 --> 17:10.029
What's wrong with her?

17:10.071 --> 17:13.075
- Cora? Responsive to stimuli.
GCS 10.

17:13.118 --> 17:16.773
- Increased resp rate, increased
pulse, but her O2's fine.

17:17.862 --> 17:18.950
Dammit!

17:18.993 --> 17:20.647
Do you keep any chemicals
at home?

17:20.691 --> 17:21.997
- Chemicals... no.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.304
Cora, if you can hear us,
say something!

17:24.347 --> 17:26.784
- Evan?
Why is it so dark?

17:26.828 --> 17:29.091
- Cora, how many fingers
do you see?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.311
- Blurry.
I can't tell.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.965
- Carbon monoxide poisoning
can cause dim vision.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.837
- And deceptive pulse ox
readings.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.795
But she's been getting
worse, not better,
away from the exposure.

17:37.839 --> 17:41.147
- Delayed neurologic sequelae
isn't uncommon with CO toxicity.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.627
Was there anyone else
in the building that displayed
similar symptoms?

17:43.671 --> 17:47.196
- Not that we know of, but
she could have been breathing
it in at the source?

17:48.110 --> 17:50.504
Hyperbaric oxygen treatment?
- Eighth floor, hurry.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.636
I'll tell them you're coming.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.081
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.999
- When's the last time
you ate?

18:08.304 --> 18:10.567
- Oh, no, I'm not hungry.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.963
- Go for a walk, Bruce.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.357
Get some air, get some food.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.707
I have time now,
I'll stay with him.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.578
Go.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.201
Hey, little man.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.900
I think we need to talk.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.512
[gentle music]

18:43.383 --> 18:47.387
- So maybe this last minute
infection is you just trying

18:47.430 --> 18:49.911
to keep things dramatic,
but...

18:51.782 --> 18:54.742
I think your dads need help
getting through this.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.704
So your job is to fight off
the fever,

19:00.748 --> 19:03.751
and I'm gonna get us over
the finish line.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.624
That sounds good?

19:12.281 --> 19:13.630
Yeah.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.589
Let's do that.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.765
- Hyperbaric chambers
deliver oxygen

19:17.808 --> 19:19.288
in a way ventilation can't.
Without it,

19:19.332 --> 19:22.639
Cora risks serious heart and
brain tissue damage.

19:25.555 --> 19:28.906
- Evan. They're bringing me up
to surgery.

19:28.950 --> 19:33.824
Where have you been?
- I was looking for Dr. Hamed.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.478
She's the other victim

19:35.522 --> 19:39.743
and Dr. Hamed thought I should
compare your symptoms to hers.

19:39.787 --> 19:43.182
- You live in the building?
- My boyfriend does.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.795
[gentle music]

19:49.100 --> 19:50.624
- Oh, Evan.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.756
She was in your apartment,
wasn't she?

19:53.844 --> 19:55.498
[heavy breathing]
- Evan? Wha--

19:55.542 --> 19:57.979
- Guys...
- I'll take the next one.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.163
[hospital hubbub]

20:10.644 --> 20:13.690
- How's the cast fit?
Not too tight?

20:13.734 --> 20:15.475
- It's fine.

20:15.518 --> 20:16.780
How's my dad?

20:18.478 --> 20:20.393
- The cardiologist needs
to run some tests.

20:20.436 --> 20:23.613
Your dad wants to know if you've
called your Aunt Margot yet?

20:23.657 --> 20:25.746
- Why won't you tell me
what's going on?

20:25.789 --> 20:29.228
Every time I go in there,
he finds some excuse
for me to leave.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.273
And he doesn't even like
Auntie Margot!

20:31.317 --> 20:32.666
- So I'm guessing you didn't
call her.

20:32.709 --> 20:35.408
- We don't need her.
- Do you know that for sure?

20:35.451 --> 20:38.628
- I know my dad had a stroke.
I looked up the symptoms.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.849
Headaches, high blood pressure,
forgetfulness.

20:41.892 --> 20:45.331
He's gotta let me show up
for him like he has for me!

20:47.028 --> 20:48.812
- Who does the cooking
at home, Ava?

20:48.856 --> 20:52.251
- My dad, but I can learn.
- Who pays the bills?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.601
Gets the car fixed?
Can you help your dad

20:54.644 --> 20:56.994
go to the bathroom
at two in the morning?

20:57.038 --> 20:58.300
What about when
you're in school?

20:58.344 --> 21:01.477
- Stop it!
You're scaring me.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.958
- I just want you to understand
what your dad is trying

21:04.001 --> 21:05.742
to protect you from.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.398
You should call your aunt.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.709
[sighing]

21:16.884 --> 21:18.538
[knocking]

21:18.581 --> 21:20.670
- There's a Dr. Brant in
the boardroom waiting for you?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.716
- Tell him I have
to reschedule.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.328
I need to focus
on keeping my job,

21:26.372 --> 21:29.766
not interviewing understudies.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.683
- How's that going for you?

21:33.727 --> 21:36.904
- Was I crazy to think
I could fight this, Claire?

21:38.079 --> 21:39.559
[sighs]

21:46.392 --> 21:47.828
- These are good.

21:52.267 --> 21:53.573
Dr. Brant?

21:53.616 --> 21:56.924
Should I send him away?
- I'll go see him.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.623
[indistinct chatter on PA]
- Incoming.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.191
- Stick around?
I might need a wingman.

22:03.234 --> 22:06.629
- Dr. Curtis. About our little
back and forth this morning.

22:06.673 --> 22:09.937
Not many residents
have the courage to correct
a senior surgeon

22:09.980 --> 22:11.721
who already
doesn't like them.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.724
In fact, most of you
just stand around here,

22:14.768 --> 22:16.422
silent and useless.

22:16.465 --> 22:19.381
- I was just standing
in the right position
to see the leak.

22:19.425 --> 22:22.079
- Don't pander.
Makes you look weak.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.473
Feeding tube is 86'd.

22:24.517 --> 22:27.607
Stomach cancer patient
has metastasis everywhere.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.739
The guy's oncologist changed
his prognosis

22:29.783 --> 22:32.438
from four months to ten days,
so he won't need it.

22:32.481 --> 22:35.266
And our birthday boy needs
to hear that what I told him

22:35.310 --> 22:37.138
was a simple perforation

22:37.181 --> 22:38.313
means that he'll have
an external bowel

22:38.357 --> 22:40.010
for the foreseeable future.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.494
- At least she gave you
an opening.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.409
Classic top down exchange.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.672
You clean up her mess
with the bowel patient,

22:49.716 --> 22:53.154
and she lets you off
the hook for whatever you did
to piss her off.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.721
[scoffs]

22:55.286 --> 22:56.810
- Yeah.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.289
Why would I...

22:58.986 --> 23:01.510
Why would I take a bullet
for someone who treats us
like dirt?

23:01.554 --> 23:03.686
- Because you're smart?

23:03.730 --> 23:06.297
I mean, stand on principle
if you want,

23:06.341 --> 23:08.474
but if were you,
I'd take the deal.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.781
Anyways. It's too bad
about cancer guy,

23:11.825 --> 23:14.784
but at least I don't have
to scrub in on a g-tube
with Roche.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.139
- Cora's back from
the chamber?

23:22.183 --> 23:24.533
- And she's improving.

23:24.577 --> 23:28.363
Labs showed her
carboxyhemoglobin levels
were 45 % before.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.060
They're down to 10 now.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.453
- Glad we could figure that out.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.934
- And since I know
you're waiting for an answer,

23:33.977 --> 23:38.547
you can tell Bishop, no, I won't
be speaking up for his cause.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.767
It's a fake initiative.

23:41.942 --> 23:44.118
- I realize that you two
have history.

23:44.161 --> 23:46.947
Why can't you see past that?
He wants us to be able
to do more.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.470
Isn't that what you're doing
all the time?

23:48.514 --> 23:50.429
- He wants us to ask
permission.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.823
The music is in doing
what is necessary.

23:54.302 --> 23:56.347
Not in making sure
your ass is covered.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.175
I thought you knew that.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.395
[machine beeping]
What now?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.918
- Her resp rate is dropping!

24:01.962 --> 24:03.964
[Gary]: I can't be helping
you in two different places.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.705
The kids are fine, my sister's
looking after them.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.358
[Bruce]: You just never listen
to me, do you?

24:07.402 --> 24:09.012
- Yes, I do. But I just had--

24:09.056 --> 24:10.536
[overlapping chatter]

24:10.579 --> 24:13.103
Because I had to be okay?
- I told you that I was fine!

24:13.147 --> 24:14.453
- But obviously,
you're not fine!

24:14.496 --> 24:16.498
- There's no point in both of us
falling apart!

24:16.542 --> 24:18.848
Why aren't you on a plane?
- Because I called him.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.502
- You shouldn't have
done that!

24:20.546 --> 24:22.112
- Yes, she should have.

24:22.156 --> 24:25.855
I was ready to board, and
all I could think of was Ollie,

24:25.899 --> 24:27.814
just after he turned
four months old.

24:28.945 --> 24:31.165
The doctors told us when
we brought him home that

24:31.208 --> 24:34.211
we shouldn't expect him
to hit developmental
milestones on time.

24:34.255 --> 24:38.128
But every morning I'd go
to his crib and see him
straining to roll over.

24:38.172 --> 24:41.610
So I'd help him, worried
he was over-exerting himself.

24:41.654 --> 24:43.873
But he would always give me
this angry little shriek

24:43.917 --> 24:45.962
like he was trying to tell me
to back off.

24:46.006 --> 24:48.225
- I didn't even know that
something that small could be
so loud...

24:48.269 --> 24:50.576
- Finally,
one morning I came in

24:50.619 --> 24:54.057
and Bruce was just sitting
there, watching him try.

24:54.101 --> 24:57.496
I went to help and do you
remember what you said to me?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.977
[soft music]

25:01.021 --> 25:02.413
- He can do it.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.024
- Yeah.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.765
And he did.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.897
Okay?

25:11.074 --> 25:13.424
[sobbing]

25:13.468 --> 25:15.470
- Well, Ollie's vitals
are stable

25:15.514 --> 25:18.821
and Dr. Fisher thinks
we can try again.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.519
If you're ready.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.783
- How could she be worse?

25:23.826 --> 25:26.263
There was no carbon
monoxide re-exposure.
What are we missing?

25:26.307 --> 25:28.614
- We need to widen our view.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.138
Her abdomen is swollen.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.927
- Oh, plenty of fluid.

25:37.971 --> 25:41.409
- Ascites?
- I'll run lab tests,
check her protein levels.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.280
- Maybe a pre-existing
condition.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.108
Did the carbon monoxide
exacerbate it?

25:45.152 --> 25:47.546
- It could be why no one else in
the building was affected.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.460
- I'll call radiology,
they'll drain the fluid.

25:49.504 --> 25:51.288
- Gloria.
Sterile gloves, please.

25:51.332 --> 25:54.378
I'm perfectly capable
of draining it here with
ultrasound guidance.

25:54.422 --> 25:57.556
Lidocaine, 22 gauge
paracentesis needle.

25:58.295 --> 26:01.951
You can go ask permission,
but I'll be done by the time
you have it.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.697
- Probe sleeve.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.571
[heavy breathing]

26:15.356 --> 26:17.488
A friend of mine outside
of Aleppo

26:17.532 --> 26:19.273
is trying to narrow down
a tough one.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.970
- Is your friend a doctor?

26:21.014 --> 26:24.321
- He's a rescue worker with some
solid field experience.

26:24.365 --> 26:25.801
- What's up?

26:25.845 --> 26:28.151
- Eight patients
in a cluster of homes.

26:28.195 --> 26:33.635
Headache, fever, joint pain,
skin ulcerations.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.899
The carbon monoxide made me
think of contaminants.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.424
- How's everything going there?

26:40.468 --> 26:42.513
Returning to some semblance
of normal?

26:42.557 --> 26:44.907
- Trying, given the blockade.

26:44.951 --> 26:47.823
- Oh, blockades disrupt
food supply,

26:47.867 --> 26:49.912
is it possible that
they're growing their own?

26:49.956 --> 26:52.741
- You're thinking
contaminated soil?

26:52.785 --> 26:55.526
- I saw a case of histoplasmosis
outside of Beirut

26:55.570 --> 26:57.572
with some farmers
a few years back.

26:57.616 --> 27:02.142
- Direct contact with
bacteria, it does fit all
the symptoms.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.710
I'll let them know.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.886
- But still no answer
for Cora.

27:06.929 --> 27:12.065
I will order some liver function
tests and more imaging.

27:12.108 --> 27:17.723
You see if her two-timing
boyfriend can shed any light
on her condition.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.599
- Two and three?
- No change.

27:26.906 --> 27:29.125
- Three and four?
- Nope.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.519
- We'll have to insert
the fifth one then.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.655
- Vitals holding steady.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.657
- Mm-hmm.
And the dads?

27:40.006 --> 27:42.095
- They're doing their best.

27:42.138 --> 27:45.707
My parents were a disaster
when it was me.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.578
Arguing, debating.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.277
If it wasn't for my doctor,
I don't know...

27:50.320 --> 27:52.671
- Terrence Mann, wasn't it?
Your cardiologist?

27:52.714 --> 27:54.411
- Yeah.

27:54.455 --> 27:57.284
- I was sad to hear about
his lung cancer.

27:58.589 --> 28:01.331
He retired last year when
he was diagnosed.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.468
Okay, cath's in.

28:08.295 --> 28:11.472
Does this get us where
we need to be?

28:11.515 --> 28:14.214
- Ostium of the CS.
That's the one.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.521
Vitals are holding strong.
- Good.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.436
- Good job, buddy.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.960
- Ablating now.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.054
That should do it.

28:30.143 --> 28:33.015
[gentle music]

28:34.147 --> 28:35.888
- Did Novak say why?

28:35.931 --> 28:39.282
- Mostly that he doesn't see
the point in drawing new lines.

28:39.326 --> 28:42.155
- When all he ever wants
to do is colour outside them.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.418
Mark has always refused
to adapt.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.986
Don't let him get in
your head.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.379
[sigh]

28:49.423 --> 28:51.947
- Sir, if the other division
heads don't get behind you?

28:51.991 --> 28:54.123
- Oh, it's only one vote,
Dr. Hamed.

28:54.167 --> 28:57.344
I stay patient, and you keep
your head down.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.999
Weren't you finished hours ago?

29:00.042 --> 29:03.176
- I stuck around to see
a few patients through.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.138
[phone chimes]

29:14.230 --> 29:16.276
[Remi]: So what are you
saying?

29:16.319 --> 29:19.061
- I love you, Remi,
but I also love her!

29:19.105 --> 29:21.498
- You love us both?
[clattering]

29:21.542 --> 29:23.979
Wow, that's seriously
what you're saying?

29:24.023 --> 29:25.372
- I swear to God,
it's the truth.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.548
- Remi, you should be resting,
and Evan,

29:27.591 --> 29:29.376
can I speak with you outside?
I need some information.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.030
- I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.075
- It's about her, though right?
Your question?

29:33.119 --> 29:35.251
What happened to that woman
is your fault, Evan,

29:35.295 --> 29:36.775
and you're not even gonna try
and help her?

29:36.818 --> 29:39.081
- I'm trying to help!
I'm trying to help her and you!

29:39.125 --> 29:41.823
- Cora's life
is on the line, Evan.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.304
If there's anything you can tell
me about her medical history,

29:44.347 --> 29:46.523
lifestyle changes, please.
- I mean, I don't know,

29:46.567 --> 29:48.830
she doesn't say much about
that stuff.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.223
- You supposedly love
this woman?

29:50.266 --> 29:51.746
He just said that
she could be dying!

29:51.790 --> 29:55.358
Who even are you?
- Okay. I'm thinking, okay?

29:55.402 --> 29:57.360
- Well, think harder!
What if it was me?

29:57.404 --> 30:00.842
Would you remember that
I get a headache when I drink
red wine?

30:00.886 --> 30:03.845
Would you remember what
antibiotic I'm allergic to?

30:03.889 --> 30:06.108
- Okay, she's avoiding dairy.

30:06.152 --> 30:09.372
I don't know if that's--
She gets carpal tunnel?

30:09.416 --> 30:11.766
When she types.
Also she can't jog anymore.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.160
- What? She can't jog?
- We used to run together,

30:14.203 --> 30:16.858
but now she can barely
go down the block without
losing her breath.

30:16.902 --> 30:17.990
And she gets lightheaded
a lot.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.643
- Okay. This is good.
Any cough?

30:19.687 --> 30:24.126
- I mean, yeah, sometimes in bed
if she's sleeping on her back.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.042
And you're allergic
to Penicillin.

30:27.086 --> 30:29.436
[clattering]
- Get out.

30:32.091 --> 30:34.267
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:35.094 --> 30:36.660
- I just...

30:37.313 --> 30:40.664
I feel like things went wrong
between us earlier?

30:40.708 --> 30:45.147
And I'm not trying
to change you, Mags.

30:45.191 --> 30:49.630
And I need you to know
that I like you.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.893
Like a lot...

30:51.937 --> 30:54.156
And...
- Jake, I--

30:54.200 --> 30:57.594
I like you too, I do.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.770
And I'm just...

31:01.163 --> 31:03.122
This was great and I'm...

31:04.427 --> 31:06.168
- I'm just not
in the right place.

31:06.212 --> 31:08.475
- Yeah, yeah.
You think we should end things.

31:10.216 --> 31:11.913
- I'm sorry, Jake.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.872
- Yeah, it's okay.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.004
I get it.

31:16.048 --> 31:17.701
- I'm sorry.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.231
- Dad's in organ failure.

31:25.274 --> 31:29.148
And they're saying
it could be days...

31:31.846 --> 31:35.241
I'm sorry, Juney.
I know you don't wanna hear
this kind of stuff but...

31:38.461 --> 31:40.289
I don't know, I just...

31:40.333 --> 31:42.204
I thought I was ready.
And...

31:43.118 --> 31:44.380
I'm not.

31:44.424 --> 31:45.947
- I called hospice.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.862
And they have
a private room, so...

31:50.691 --> 31:52.345
- You knew?

31:55.261 --> 31:56.479
Why would you do that?

31:56.523 --> 31:59.700
- Well, it was purely selfish.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.963
If dad's happy, he's less likely
to cause trouble--

32:02.007 --> 32:06.315
- No, I mean why would
you let me hear that news
from a stranger?!

32:07.447 --> 32:09.710
- What? Charles--
- No!

32:11.625 --> 32:13.844
So you couldn't put
your pride aside long enough

32:13.888 --> 32:15.716
to come and tell me this?

32:19.154 --> 32:21.896
You know, this resentment
you cling to, June.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.204
Is its own cancer.

32:36.215 --> 32:39.000
- Hey, Theodore Hunter.
My stalker.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.871
Yes, I got your voicemails.

32:40.915 --> 32:42.482
No, I'm not here to see you.

32:42.525 --> 32:44.397
My daughter,
your former patient,

32:44.440 --> 32:45.833
she's seeing
her respirologist.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.879
- Hi, Shelley. Can we--
- We had sex once.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.360
- I know and I didn't mean
to come on strong,

32:51.404 --> 32:53.188
but I'm just--
Look, that night

32:53.232 --> 32:56.061
was the first good thing that
has happened to me

32:56.104 --> 32:57.714
in a while, so I'm just...

32:58.454 --> 33:00.108
- You feel messed up.

33:00.152 --> 33:03.720
You feel thrown to sea
by your ex?

33:05.070 --> 33:06.941
I'm not your lifeboat.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.770
- Got it.
- You'll be fine.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.044
[machine beeping]

33:23.088 --> 33:25.133
- What happened?
- We don't know.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.830
He went into sudden V-fib
and arrested.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.398
We've shocked twice.
Charged to 30 joules.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.313
- Clear!
- Shocking.

33:31.357 --> 33:34.186
- I'll take over.
Still pulseless V-fib.

33:34.229 --> 33:37.363
Come on, little guy.
- Charging to 60 joules.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.453
Clear! Shocking.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.806
We've lost all electrical
activity.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.113
- We can't give up on him!

33:48.591 --> 33:50.767
- I'm sorry, Mags.
He's gone.

33:50.811 --> 33:53.596
- No, it doesn't make any sense!
He was fine!

33:53.640 --> 33:56.295
He had no fever,
no instability!

33:56.338 --> 33:58.601
No nothing.
- Sometimes there are no signs.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.692
[flatlining]

34:06.131 --> 34:08.829
Time of death, 6:21.

34:08.871 --> 34:10.699
- No, no.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.661
[dramatic music]

34:20.710 --> 34:24.235
- I'm so sorry
that I wasn't honest.

34:24.279 --> 34:27.021
- It doesn't matter that
you're sorry.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.763
This isn't about you.

34:30.503 --> 34:33.158
- You can't expect me
to just walk away.

34:33.766 --> 34:35.377
I love you.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.859
And, it's over with her.

34:38.902 --> 34:42.471
- And you think I'm more likely
to forgive you.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.866
Because you think
I'm a doormat.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.650
- Baby, no.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.435
- Well, I'm not.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.437
And I'm not your baby!

34:51.480 --> 34:52.568
Get out!

34:53.743 --> 34:56.137
- Cora, you don't mean that.

34:56.181 --> 35:00.315
[scoffs]
- Don't tell me what I feel.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.578
- Okay, Evan.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.145
It's time to go.

35:14.808 --> 35:17.027
- How's the other girl doing?

35:17.071 --> 35:18.942
- She's recovering well.

35:19.813 --> 35:23.469
I was wondering if you had any
questions about your diagnosis.

35:23.512 --> 35:28.604
- Acute cardiomyo-something?
- Cardiomyopathy.

35:28.648 --> 35:32.130
It means a part of your heart
muscle is diseased.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.001
It's fairly uncommon
in someone your age,

35:34.044 --> 35:36.438
but the carbon monoxide
made it worse.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.136
- What happens next?

35:38.179 --> 35:40.181
- You'll see a cardiologist.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.575
And there's a range
of interventions to try out.

35:47.884 --> 35:51.584
- It's almost funny isn't it?

35:52.889 --> 35:57.372
Getting your heart broken only
to find out...

35:58.286 --> 36:00.201
it already was.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.944
- Hey, you're young and
strong.

36:03.987 --> 36:05.902
You can fight this.

36:08.905 --> 36:11.212
[sirens blaring
in the distance]

36:11.256 --> 36:13.214
- How'd it work out
for your friend back home?

36:13.258 --> 36:14.433
- You and I were both wrong.

36:14.476 --> 36:16.391
The team on the ground
figured it out.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.872
It was three manifestations
of TB, highly contagious,

36:18.915 --> 36:20.352
all different symptoms.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.876
Thankfully,
they didn't need us.

36:22.919 --> 36:27.533
- Hey, if you ever want to trade
these problems for those ones.

36:27.576 --> 36:30.405
You know, I take my vacation
in the region every year,

36:30.449 --> 36:32.320
wherever I'm most needed.

36:32.929 --> 36:36.106
- I couldn't leave my sister.
- Ah.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.547
- They're called
transientischemic-attacks.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.418
- Mini-strokes, I know.

36:43.462 --> 36:46.943
- They said I'd been having
a few, which explains why
I've been...

36:46.987 --> 36:49.903
off. But today...
- Was a full stroke.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.252
- It was the start of one.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.081
Your father's on an IV drug
called tPA.

36:54.124 --> 36:57.606
It breaks up the clot that
is blocking the flow of blood
to his brain.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.434
- The only reason
they're able to use this drug

36:59.478 --> 37:02.959
is because of you helping me
catch it when you did.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.745
You saved my life, baby girl.

37:06.833 --> 37:09.444
But Ava, I don't want you
giving up anything for me.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.926
- Dad, it's okay.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.450
Dr. Hunter talked me through
what you'd need.

37:15.494 --> 37:18.932
We can get home-care nurses
for when I'm in school

37:18.975 --> 37:21.674
and I started a list of all
the stuff I can do.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.284
- I called Margot,

37:23.328 --> 37:25.286
and you're going to stay with
her for a while.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.941
- I can do this for you.
I want to.

37:27.984 --> 37:31.118
- I know you can.
And in ten years, 15 tops,

37:31.161 --> 37:32.598
I promise I'll let you.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.296
But for now, this is
the way it's gotta be.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.472
And if you need to be mad
at me, I understand.

37:49.876 --> 37:51.617
- Cardiology?

37:51.660 --> 37:54.663
You still following patients
out of your purview, Leblanc?

37:55.403 --> 37:57.318
- I'm doing a resident practice.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.668
- Two jobs?
Yeah, that checks out.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.931
If you wanna save
even more lives,

38:01.975 --> 38:04.282
I can get you some shifts
at the ICU.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.640
- He was okay.

38:15.684 --> 38:18.165
He came out okay!

38:20.210 --> 38:21.995
- Was it the procedure?

38:22.038 --> 38:24.084
Did it cause this?

38:24.911 --> 38:27.043
- The ablation went perfectly.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.655
Sudden cardiac death

38:29.698 --> 38:32.658
is a risk of Ollie's congenital
heart defect.

38:35.008 --> 38:37.271
I want you to know that...

38:38.228 --> 38:42.581
he gave it everything
he had.

38:43.233 --> 38:46.149
[sobbing]
- I am so sorry.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.196
I'm so sorry.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.476
- What's wrong?
- I know you're weighing
a job offer, but...

39:08.520 --> 39:11.871
Don't go to St. Luke's.
- Jed...

39:11.914 --> 39:13.525
- You can do your clinical
hours here,

39:13.568 --> 39:16.310
become a nurse practitioner.
You'll get a raise,

39:16.354 --> 39:18.268
you'll have seniority.
I'll make sure.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.183
- Okay, we've been over this.

39:20.227 --> 39:22.534
I want to learn without
a safety net.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.100
If you're here...

39:25.319 --> 39:27.408
- I'm not ready
to treat patients.

39:27.452 --> 39:31.194
Maybe I never will be.
But when you're here...

39:31.238 --> 39:33.501
none of that matters.

39:35.285 --> 39:38.767
I know it's unfair and
I'm being selfish, but...

39:39.377 --> 39:41.509
I need you, so I'm asking.

39:42.858 --> 39:44.294
Stay.

39:48.255 --> 39:52.259
- Your rotation came at
a strange time for me, Jake.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.957
And I like you, I do.

39:56.176 --> 39:59.222
But before you finish,
I wanted you to hear from me

39:59.266 --> 40:01.877
that if this job
isn't for you,

40:01.921 --> 40:04.227
there isn't anything
wrong with that.

40:04.837 --> 40:07.056
- Hold on. Are you telling me
that I'm not

40:07.100 --> 40:10.712
cut out to be a doctor?
- No.

40:12.235 --> 40:15.456
But I have been saying all along
you need to do the work,

40:15.500 --> 40:19.329
you have to go out of your way
to apply the knowledge,

40:19.373 --> 40:20.766
and I haven't really seen that.

40:20.809 --> 40:23.029
- Because I don't let this job
dominate my life

40:23.072 --> 40:25.858
like the rest of you?
- That's fair.

40:26.380 --> 40:31.603
But look, I know what
it's like to be on this path...

40:32.386 --> 40:34.127
and not know
how you got there.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.652
I'm trying to help you, Jake.

40:38.523 --> 40:40.002
Anyway...

40:41.482 --> 40:43.136
- Can I go?

40:44.311 --> 40:45.660
- Yeah.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.797
[somber music]

40:59.544 --> 41:01.328
- I heard what happened.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.811
The death of a baby...

41:07.465 --> 41:09.815
It takes a toll on any doctor.

41:10.685 --> 41:13.079
And you're not just any doctor.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.390
- I failed him.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.055
[in Arabic]:

41:59.952 --> 42:02.171
[Mitchell]: And you want to fix
that, but you can't.

42:02.215 --> 42:04.913
Those are completely valid
emotions at this stage.

42:04.957 --> 42:07.394
The lawsuit, the pressure
you're under...

42:07.437 --> 42:11.354
- What if I don't want
to hear that my feelings are
"part of the process?"

42:13.574 --> 42:17.012
I hear myself complaining
and I hate the sound of
my own voice.

42:17.056 --> 42:18.623
But it's all that
ever happens here.

42:18.666 --> 42:20.973
- That's a lot of judgement.

42:25.978 --> 42:28.546
What else has been going
on lately?

42:29.547 --> 42:32.158
Have you been having
more memories of the past?

42:32.201 --> 42:34.900
- I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

42:36.075 --> 42:38.512
but I'm not sure
I can keep coming here.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.383
- Bashir, let's talk
about this.

42:40.427 --> 42:42.211
If things are hard right now,
pushing me away--

42:42.255 --> 42:45.258
- I'm sorry Dr. Mitchell,
I don't think you can help me.

[hospital hubbub]

43:37.092 --> 43:40.139
- How's the cast fit?
Not too tight?

43:40.182 --> 43:41.923
- It's fine.

43:41.967 --> 43:43.229
How's my dad?

43:44.926 --> 43:46.841
- The cardiologist needs
to run some tests.

43:46.885 --> 43:50.062
Your dad wants to know if you've
called your Aunt Margot yet?

43:50.105 --> 43:52.194
- Why won't you tell me
what's going on?

43:52.238 --> 43:55.676
Every time I go in there,
he finds some excuse
for me to leave.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.722
And he doesn't even like
Auntie Margot!

43:57.765 --> 43:59.114
- So I'm guessing you didn't
call her.

43:59.158 --> 44:01.856
- We don't need her.
- Do you know that for sure?

44:01.900 --> 44:05.077
- I know my dad had a stroke.
I looked up the symptoms.

44:05.120 --> 44:08.297
Headaches, high blood pressure,
forgetfulness.

44:08.341 --> 44:11.779
He's gotta let me show up
for him like he has for me!

44:13.476 --> 44:15.261
- Who does the cooking
at home, Ava?

44:15.304 --> 44:18.699
- My dad, but I can learn.
- Who pays the bills?

44:18.743 --> 44:21.049
Gets the car fixed?
Can you help your dad

44:21.093 --> 44:23.443
go to the bathroom
at two in the morning?

44:23.486 --> 44:24.749
What about when
you're in school?

44:24.792 --> 44:27.926
- Stop it!
You're scaring me.

44:27.969 --> 44:30.406
- I just want you to understand
what your dad is trying

44:30.450 --> 44:32.191
to protect you from.

44:33.932 --> 44:35.847
You should call your aunt.

44:40.242 --> 44:42.157
[sighing]

44:43.332 --> 44:44.986
[knocking]

44:45.030 --> 44:47.119
- There's a Dr. Brant in
the boardroom waiting for you?

44:47.162 --> 44:49.164
- Tell him I have
to reschedule.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.777
I need to focus
on keeping my job,

44:52.820 --> 44:56.215
not interviewing understudies.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.132
- How's that going for you?

45:00.175 --> 45:03.352
- Was I crazy to think
I could fight this, Claire?

45:04.527 --> 45:06.007
[sighs]

45:12.840 --> 45:14.276
- These are good.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.021
Dr. Brant?

45:20.065 --> 45:23.372
Should I send him away?
- I'll go see him.

45:25.113 --> 45:27.072
[indistinct chatter on PA]
- Incoming.

45:27.855 --> 45:29.639
- Stick around?
I might need a wingman.

45:29.683 --> 45:33.078
- Dr. Curtis. About our little
back and forth this morning.

45:33.121 --> 45:36.385
Not many residents
have the courage to correct
a senior surgeon

45:36.429 --> 45:38.170
who already
doesn't like them.

45:38.213 --> 45:41.173
In fact, most of you
just stand around here,

45:41.216 --> 45:42.870
silent and useless.

45:42.914 --> 45:45.830
- I was just standing
in the right position
to see the leak.

45:45.873 --> 45:48.528
- Don't pander.
Makes you look weak.

45:48.571 --> 45:50.922
Feeding tube is 86'd.

45:50.965 --> 45:54.055
Stomach cancer patient
has metastasis everywhere.

45:54.099 --> 45:56.188
The guy's oncologist changed
his prognosis

45:56.231 --> 45:58.886
from four months to ten days,
so he won't need it.

45:58.930 --> 46:01.715
And our birthday boy needs
to hear that what I told him

46:01.759 --> 46:03.586
was a simple perforation

46:03.630 --> 46:04.762
means that he'll have
an external bowel

46:04.805 --> 46:06.459
for the foreseeable future.

46:09.897 --> 46:11.943
- At least she gave you
an opening.

46:11.986 --> 46:13.858
Classic top down exchange.

46:13.901 --> 46:16.121
You clean up her mess
with the bowel patient,

46:16.164 --> 46:19.602
and she lets you off
the hook for whatever you did
to piss her off.

46:19.646 --> 46:21.169
[scoffs]

46:21.735 --> 46:23.258
- Yeah.

46:23.302 --> 46:24.738
Why would I...

46:25.434 --> 46:27.959
Why would I take a bullet
for someone who treats us
like dirt?

46:28.002 --> 46:30.135
- Because you're smart?

46:30.178 --> 46:32.746
I mean, stand on principle
if you want,

46:32.790 --> 46:34.922
but if were you,
I'd take the deal.

46:35.967 --> 46:38.230
Anyways. It's too bad
about cancer guy,

46:38.273 --> 46:41.233
but at least I don't have
to scrub in on a g-tube
with Roche.

46:46.934 --> 46:48.588
- Cora's back from
the chamber?

46:48.631 --> 46:50.982
- And she's improving.

46:51.025 --> 46:54.812
Labs showed her
carboxyhemoglobin levels
were 45 % before.

46:54.855 --> 46:56.509
They're down to 10 now.

46:56.552 --> 46:57.902
- Glad we could figure that out.

46:57.945 --> 47:00.382
- And since I know
you're waiting for an answer,

47:00.426 --> 47:04.996
you can tell Bishop, no, I won't
be speaking up for his cause.

47:05.039 --> 47:07.215
It's a fake initiative.

47:08.390 --> 47:10.566
- I realize that you two
have history.

47:10.610 --> 47:13.395
Why can't you see past that?
He wants us to be able
to do more.

47:13.439 --> 47:14.919
Isn't that what you're doing
all the time?

47:14.962 --> 47:16.834
- He wants us to ask
permission.

47:17.443 --> 47:20.272
The music is in doing
what is necessary.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.796
Not in making sure
your ass is covered.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.624
I thought you knew that.

47:24.667 --> 47:26.844
[machine beeping]
What now?

47:26.887 --> 47:28.367
- Her resp rate is dropping!

47:28.410 --> 47:30.412
[Gary]: I can't be helping
you in two different places.

47:30.456 --> 47:32.153
The kids are fine, my sister's
looking after them.

47:32.197 --> 47:33.807
[Bruce]: You just never listen
to me, do you?

47:33.851 --> 47:35.461
- Yes, I do. But I just had--

47:35.504 --> 47:36.984
[overlapping chatter]

47:37.028 --> 47:39.552
Because I had to be okay?
- I told you that I was fine!

47:39.595 --> 47:40.901
- But obviously,
you're not fine!

47:40.945 --> 47:42.947
- There's no point in both of us
falling apart!

47:42.990 --> 47:45.297
Why aren't you on a plane?
- Because I called him.

47:45.340 --> 47:46.951
- You shouldn't have
done that!

47:46.994 --> 47:48.561
- Yes, she should have.

47:48.604 --> 47:52.304
I was ready to board, and
all I could think of was Ollie,

47:52.347 --> 47:54.262
just after he turned
four months old.

47:55.394 --> 47:57.613
The doctors told us when
we brought him home that

47:57.657 --> 48:00.660
we shouldn't expect him
to hit developmental
milestones on time.

48:00.703 --> 48:04.577
But every morning I'd go
to his crib and see him
straining to roll over.

48:04.620 --> 48:08.059
So I'd help him, worried
he was over-exerting himself.

48:08.102 --> 48:10.322
But he would always give me
this angry little shriek

48:10.365 --> 48:12.411
like he was trying to tell me
to back off.

48:12.454 --> 48:14.674
- I didn't even know that
something that small could be
so loud...

48:14.717 --> 48:17.024
- Finally,
one morning I came in

48:17.068 --> 48:20.506
and Bruce was just sitting
there, watching him try.

48:20.549 --> 48:23.901
I went to help and do you
remember what you said to me?

48:24.989 --> 48:27.426
[soft music]

48:27.469 --> 48:28.862
- He can do it.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.472
- Yeah.

48:30.516 --> 48:32.213
And he did.

48:32.866 --> 48:34.346
Okay?

48:37.523 --> 48:39.873
[sobbing]

48:39.917 --> 48:41.919
- Well, Ollie's vitals
are stable

48:41.962 --> 48:45.270
and Dr. Fisher thinks
we can try again.

48:45.313 --> 48:46.967
If you're ready.

48:48.055 --> 48:50.231
- How could she be worse?

48:50.275 --> 48:52.712
There was no carbon
monoxide re-exposure.
What are we missing?

48:52.755 --> 48:55.062
- We need to widen our view.

48:55.584 --> 48:57.586
Her abdomen is swollen.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.376
- Oh, plenty of fluid.

49:04.419 --> 49:07.857
- Ascites?
- I'll run lab tests,
check her protein levels.

49:07.901 --> 49:09.729
- Maybe a pre-existing
condition.

49:09.772 --> 49:11.557
Did the carbon monoxide
exacerbate it?

49:11.600 --> 49:13.994
- It could be why no one else in
the building was affected.

49:14.038 --> 49:15.909
- I'll call radiology,
they'll drain the fluid.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.737
- Gloria.
Sterile gloves, please.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.827
I'm perfectly capable
of draining it here with
ultrasound guidance.

49:20.870 --> 49:23.961
Lidocaine, 22 gauge
paracentesis needle.

49:24.700 --> 49:28.400
You can go ask permission,
but I'll be done by the time
you have it.

49:33.057 --> 49:35.146
- Probe sleeve.

49:36.582 --> 49:39.019
[heavy breathing]

49:41.804 --> 49:43.937
A friend of mine outside
of Aleppo

49:43.981 --> 49:45.721
is trying to narrow down
a tough one.

49:45.765 --> 49:47.419
- Is your friend a doctor?

49:47.462 --> 49:50.770
- He's a rescue worker with some
solid field experience.

49:50.813 --> 49:52.250
- What's up?

49:52.293 --> 49:54.600
- Eight patients
in a cluster of homes.

49:54.643 --> 50:00.084
Headache, fever, joint pain,
skin ulcerations.

50:00.127 --> 50:03.348
The carbon monoxide made me
think of contaminants.

50:05.089 --> 50:06.873
- How's everything going there?

50:06.916 --> 50:08.962
Returning to some semblance
of normal?

50:09.006 --> 50:11.356
- Trying, given the blockade.

50:11.399 --> 50:14.272
- Oh, blockades disrupt
food supply,

50:14.315 --> 50:16.361
is it possible that
they're growing their own?

50:16.404 --> 50:19.190
- You're thinking
contaminated soil?

50:19.233 --> 50:21.975
- I saw a case of histoplasmosis
outside of Beirut

50:22.019 --> 50:24.021
with some farmers
a few years back.

50:24.064 --> 50:28.590
- Direct contact with
bacteria, it does fit all
the symptoms.

50:29.678 --> 50:31.158
I'll let them know.

50:31.202 --> 50:33.334
- But still no answer
for Cora.

50:33.378 --> 50:38.513
I will order some liver function
tests and more imaging.

50:38.557 --> 50:44.171
You see if her two-timing
boyfriend can shed any light
on her condition.
