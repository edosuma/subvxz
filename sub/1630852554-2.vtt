00:04.366 --> 00:06.033
GATES: I'm Henry
Louis Gates, Jr.

00:06.066 --> 00:08.900
Welcome to
"Finding Your Roots."

00:08.933 --> 00:12.266
In this episode, we'll meet
actor Raul Esparza and

00:12.300 --> 00:14.500
chef David Chang...

00:14.533 --> 00:17.900
Two men whose families
fled their homelands,

00:17.933 --> 00:22.733
leaving them to wonder about
all that was left behind...

00:23.766 --> 00:24.876
ESPARZA: At the time,
it seemed to me like

00:24.900 --> 00:26.833
they left Cuba
hundreds of years ago.

00:26.866 --> 00:30.433
And only now do I realize
how raw everything was.

00:31.233 --> 00:33.100
CHANG: You know
stuff happened.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.466
And there was this
unspoken rule that you

00:35.500 --> 00:37.033
just don't bring it up.

00:37.066 --> 00:38.900
Ever.

00:38.933 --> 00:41.400
GATES: To uncover
their roots, we've used

00:41.433 --> 00:43.600
every tool available.

00:43.633 --> 00:46.666
Genealogists combed through
paper trails stretching back

00:46.700 --> 00:50.900
hundreds of years, while DNA
experts utilized the latest

00:50.933 --> 00:54.500
advances in genetic analysis
to reveal secrets that have

00:54.533 --> 00:57.266
lain hidden for generations.

00:57.300 --> 01:02.000
And we've compiled everything
into a book of life,

01:02.033 --> 01:05.033
a record of all of
our discoveries...

01:05.066 --> 01:06.433
CHANG: What is happening, man?

01:06.466 --> 01:09.066
GATES: And a window
into the hidden past...

01:09.100 --> 01:10.566
ESPARZA: That's crazy, man.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.300
The weight of that
much history is like...

01:13.333 --> 01:16.100
GATES: What does that journey,
from them to you,

01:16.133 --> 01:17.533
mean to you?

01:17.566 --> 01:20.266
CHANG: It puts a lot of
things into perspective that

01:20.300 --> 01:23.566
I thought I knew about,
but now I really didn't

01:23.600 --> 01:26.100
know anything about at all.

01:26.133 --> 01:30.066
GATES: David and Raul are
the children of exiles.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.300
They've spent their entire
lives wondering about

01:33.333 --> 01:35.900
places they've never seen.

01:35.933 --> 01:40.100
In this episode, they're going
to travel to those places,

01:40.133 --> 01:43.500
retracing the journeys
their ancestors took,

01:43.533 --> 01:48.000
and finding lost parts of
themselves along the way.

01:49.966 --> 01:56.566
(theme music plays)

02:23.833 --> 02:30.466
♪ ♪

02:31.533 --> 02:33.833
GATES: Raul Esparza
has been lighting up

02:33.866 --> 02:38.233
Broadway, and Hollywood,
for more than two decades...

02:38.900 --> 02:42.700
Moving between wry
musicals, and dark dramas,

02:42.733 --> 02:46.100
he's shown immense
versatility and a seemingly

02:46.133 --> 02:48.600
bottomless well of talent.

02:48.633 --> 02:51.566
But for someone who has
embodied so many intense

02:51.600 --> 02:56.066
characters, Raul himself
is surprisingly easy-going.

02:59.700 --> 03:03.400
In person, he's
soft-spoken, self-effacing,

03:03.433 --> 03:07.033
and eager to credit his
family for his success...

03:07.566 --> 03:12.033
Learning their story,
I understood why.

03:12.933 --> 03:15.333
Raul grew up in a
suburb of Miami,

03:15.366 --> 03:18.566
surrounded by parents and
grandparents who'd fled

03:18.600 --> 03:20.300
Castro's Cuba and who were

03:20.333 --> 03:23.133
working hard just
to make ends meet.

03:23.900 --> 03:28.966
Even so, they encouraged Raul
to follow his own passions.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.300
ESPARZA: This is an
interesting thing.

03:32.333 --> 03:36.400
For the longest time, I said
"I'm going to be a lawyer."

03:36.433 --> 03:37.733
GATES: Mmm-hmmm.

03:37.766 --> 03:41.733
ESPARZA: And all the way into
college I thought that's what

03:41.766 --> 03:43.133
I'm going to do: be a lawyer.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.066
GATES: Right.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.766
ESPARZA: But as I
got older and I got...

03:46.800 --> 03:49.366
Clearly was doing
well with the acting,

03:49.400 --> 03:51.633
for some reason my
parents encouraged me.

03:51.666 --> 03:52.966
Which, you never
hear that story.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.666
And they said, "you should be...

03:55.700 --> 03:58.366
Do the thing you're good at.
Life's too short."

03:58.400 --> 03:59.866
GATES: Hmm.
How do you explain that?

03:59.900 --> 04:01.442
ESPARZA: I think it's
because they're exiles,

04:01.466 --> 04:03.476
and I think it's because
they lost everything they had,

04:03.500 --> 04:05.866
and they were like,
"there's no guarantees,

04:05.900 --> 04:08.733
so why don't you just
do the thing you love."

04:10.733 --> 04:13.566
GATES: Raul's parents
had an admirable attitude,

04:13.600 --> 04:17.333
but their support would
be put to a stern test.

04:18.366 --> 04:21.666
In 1999, when
Raul was almost 30,

04:21.700 --> 04:24.366
and still barely making
a living as an actor,

04:24.400 --> 04:28.300
he was cast as "Che" in a
national touring production of

04:28.333 --> 04:31.333
the hit musical "Evita".

04:31.366 --> 04:34.500
It was a plum role, but his
character was based on

04:34.533 --> 04:38.166
Che Guevara, a leader of
the Cuban revolution and

04:38.200 --> 04:41.400
a reviled figure
in Raul's family.

04:42.966 --> 04:43.666
Okay.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.900
I want you to do me a favor.

04:44.933 --> 04:47.000
Ring, your mother answers.

04:47.033 --> 04:48.633
"Mom, get dad on the other line.

04:48.666 --> 04:51.166
Guess what I've
been cast to play?"

04:51.200 --> 04:52.400
ESPARZA: Yeah.

04:52.433 --> 04:56.400
I remember my mom said,
"over my dead body."

04:57.700 --> 05:00.400
And my grandfather said, huh?

05:00.433 --> 05:02.500
What do you mean?

05:02.533 --> 05:04.300
He's in a, you're in a,
you're in a musical?"

05:04.333 --> 05:05.300
I was like, "yeah."

05:05.333 --> 05:06.366
"Che in a musical?"

05:06.400 --> 05:07.400
I'm like, "yeah."

05:07.433 --> 05:11.833
He's like, "hmmmm.
He didn't sing and dance."

05:11.866 --> 05:15.133
Like, you know?

05:15.966 --> 05:17.466
He's like, "uh, in a musical?"

05:17.500 --> 05:19.242
I said, "yeah, it's a musical
about the life of Eva Peron."

05:19.266 --> 05:20.476
He's like, "They didn't
know each other."

05:20.500 --> 05:22.400
Everybody in the family is like,

05:22.433 --> 05:24.466
"I don't think so."

05:24.500 --> 05:27.333
GATES: Raul, of course,
took the part,

05:27.366 --> 05:29.433
and never looked back.

05:30.666 --> 05:33.600
Not surprisingly, his
family quickly forgave him the

05:33.633 --> 05:37.566
decision, and he's remained
intensely loyal to them,

05:37.600 --> 05:40.566
grateful for the home that
they created far from the

05:40.600 --> 05:42.666
place where they were born.

05:43.266 --> 05:44.976
ESPARZA: You know, I think one
of the reasons I'm an actor is

05:45.000 --> 05:47.966
because of the stories
that they always told me.

05:49.366 --> 05:52.233
Cubans tell so many stories
that I think the idea of

05:52.266 --> 05:57.100
telling stories and
sharing stories is kind of

05:57.133 --> 05:59.533
second nature to me.

05:59.566 --> 06:01.466
My family's also kept
me really grounded.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.966
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.242
ESPARZA: I feel
appreciated, I feel special,

06:04.266 --> 06:10.066
but I don't feel like anything
anybody has to bow to and

06:10.100 --> 06:12.300
it's really good to keep
things in perspective.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.533
GATES: Mm-hmm.

06:13.566 --> 06:16.433
ESPARZA: I will say one of the
biggest moments I had was on

06:16.466 --> 06:18.966
this musical, on "Company",

06:19.000 --> 06:22.266
which was a very
big success for me.

06:22.300 --> 06:26.633
And the day that my name
was on the marquee at

06:26.666 --> 06:27.766
the Barrymore Theatre.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.900
GATES: Mm-hmm.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.833
ESPARZA: I saw my
name up there:

06:30.866 --> 06:33.500
"Raul Esparza in
Stephen Sondheim's 'Company'."

06:33.533 --> 06:34.666
GATES: Mmm.

06:34.700 --> 06:35.942
ESPARZA: And I remember
telling Steve Sondheim, like,

06:35.966 --> 06:39.866
"Steve, there's my name over
the title of a show of yours.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.009
I mean, it's a major revival.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.400
I'm in the 'New York Times'."

06:42.433 --> 06:45.366
He goes, "yeah,
don't get too excited."

06:45.400 --> 06:47.833
But I see the name and
I'm like, "there it is."

06:47.866 --> 06:50.200
And what I flashed on
was my grandfather's name,

06:50.233 --> 06:51.842
my father's name, my
great-grandfather's name.

06:51.866 --> 06:52.966
You know?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.909
It's like, "that's a,
that's a Cuban name up there!"

06:54.933 --> 06:57.533
GATES: Yeah.

07:00.033 --> 07:03.366
My second guest is
superstar chef David Chang.

07:03.400 --> 07:07.366
Since 2004, when he
opened his first restaurant,

07:07.400 --> 07:10.166
a noodle bar on
Manhattan's lower east side,

07:10.200 --> 07:14.700
David has built a culinary
empire by relentlessly mixing

07:14.733 --> 07:17.833
tradition and experimentation...

07:18.400 --> 07:20.433
It's an approach that
he traces back to

07:20.466 --> 07:23.333
his childhood home...

07:26.533 --> 07:29.833
Growing up in Virginia,
David vividly recalls that

07:29.866 --> 07:33.766
his mother, who had fled
North Korea as a child,

07:33.800 --> 07:37.600
did not cook like the
other mothers in town.

07:38.900 --> 07:42.000
CHANG: I remember pretty
early on there was a distinct

07:42.033 --> 07:45.500
difference between white
people food and the food that

07:45.533 --> 07:46.633
my mom would make.

07:46.666 --> 07:47.800
GATES: Right.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.176
CHANG: And this is a story
that I think many immigrant

07:49.200 --> 07:52.200
kids can relate to, is when
you first bring someone over

07:52.233 --> 07:54.933
that isn't of your
sort of ethnicity,

07:54.966 --> 07:57.833
and they eat the food that
they've never had before,

07:57.866 --> 08:01.566
that you think is normal,
definitely not normal to them.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.566
GATES: No, right.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.333
CHANG: So my
brothers and I were like,

08:04.366 --> 08:07.100
"We only want to eat,
you know, white people food."

08:07.133 --> 08:08.642
GATES: Yeah.
And what'd your mother say?

08:08.666 --> 08:09.933
"well, go next door."

08:09.966 --> 08:10.766
CHANG: Yeah.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.700
GATES: You know because...

08:11.733 --> 08:13.142
CHANG: No. She tried
her best to, to,

08:13.166 --> 08:14.900
to make it for us, right?

08:14.933 --> 08:17.433
And, uh, she's an amazing cook,

08:17.466 --> 08:21.966
and, and it was what she
thought a white family would

08:22.000 --> 08:24.566
want to eat, and
that's sort of what we ate,

08:24.600 --> 08:26.200
is like "based
on a true story."

08:26.233 --> 08:27.333
GATES: Uh-huh.

08:27.366 --> 08:30.033
CHANG: So, it was this
Korean American mix of things.

08:30.066 --> 08:33.300
Which, quite frankly,
had a lasting impact.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.500
I think it's why I
am who I am today,

08:35.533 --> 08:38.366
at least in terms of what
I explore, cuisine-wise.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.266
GATES: Yeah.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.376
"I want a hamburger
and french fries!"

08:40.400 --> 08:42.066
CHANG: Yeah.

08:42.966 --> 08:44.909
GATES: While David may have
inherited his cooking skills

08:44.933 --> 08:47.700
from his mother, his
father was determined that

08:47.733 --> 08:50.333
he suppress those skills...

08:50.366 --> 08:54.066
And his father was an
authority on the subject.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.733
During David's childhood,
his father owned and managed

08:57.766 --> 09:01.100
a series of restaurants
in Washington, DC, and

09:01.133 --> 09:03.500
he most certainly did
not want his son to

09:03.533 --> 09:05.800
follow in his footsteps.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.900
Instead, his hopes for David
were focused on something

09:08.933 --> 09:12.366
very different:
the sport of golf.

09:14.033 --> 09:16.100
CHANG: I had a complicated
relationship with my dad.

09:16.133 --> 09:19.233
He put a lot of pressure on me.

09:20.066 --> 09:22.333
He just wanted me to be
a professional golfer.

09:22.366 --> 09:25.000
That was it.
That was his only dream.

09:25.033 --> 09:26.776
GATES: What, where did
that fantasy come from?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.366
CHANG: I have zero idea.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.300
It was the, of
all the sports, uh,

09:31.333 --> 09:32.733
and that's what he wanted.

09:32.766 --> 09:36.500
It had more to do with golf,
everything to do with golf,

09:36.533 --> 09:39.033
and nothing to do
with restaurants.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.933
GATES: Given his
father's feelings,

09:41.966 --> 09:45.566
David's path to success
wasn't a smooth one.

09:47.466 --> 09:50.166
He was actually a
talented junior golfer,

09:50.200 --> 09:53.400
but he'd quit by
the time he was 14.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.933
After college, he quit
a fledgling career in

09:55.966 --> 09:58.000
business as well.

09:58.033 --> 10:00.500
Then he insisted on
going to culinary school,

10:00.533 --> 10:04.100
against his father's wishes,
and ended up with a job

10:04.133 --> 10:07.633
at New York's
prestigious Mercer Kitchen.

10:07.666 --> 10:10.400
Again, his
ambitions began to waver,

10:10.433 --> 10:13.566
but this time he held on.

10:14.666 --> 10:17.366
CHANG: I remember the first
sort of six months of going to

10:17.400 --> 10:21.066
school and working at the
Mercer Kitchen and then

10:21.100 --> 10:23.200
interning around
various other places,

10:23.233 --> 10:25.933
that, this is not for me.

10:27.266 --> 10:28.500
This is not for me.

10:28.533 --> 10:32.133
But I had, you know, made such
a big stink about this is what

10:32.166 --> 10:34.800
I was going to do, that it
was pride that kept me in it.

10:34.833 --> 10:35.700
GATES: Yeah.

10:35.733 --> 10:36.633
You couldn't tell your father.

10:36.666 --> 10:37.600
CHANG: Yeah.

10:37.633 --> 10:39.376
GATES: You said, "got
those golf clubs, dad?"

10:39.400 --> 10:40.800
CHANG: Yeah.

10:40.833 --> 10:44.500
And, you know, I think that's
probably the only talent that

10:44.533 --> 10:47.333
I have, is that I'm just
stubborn enough to

10:47.366 --> 10:49.100
keep on doing something.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.400
GATES: God, I wonder
where you got that from?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.433
My two guests
both grew up in families

10:55.466 --> 10:58.866
struggling to
plant roots in exile.

10:58.900 --> 11:02.900
This poses a unique
challenge to genealogists...

11:02.933 --> 11:06.733
An exile is not
simply an immigrant.

11:06.766 --> 11:09.200
They're people who,
for political reasons,

11:09.233 --> 11:12.333
cannot return to
their native lands,

11:12.366 --> 11:16.500
this means that they live
cut off from their ancestry,

11:16.533 --> 11:19.866
unable to access
their own family history.

11:21.466 --> 11:25.900
It was time to see if we could
restore what had been lost.

11:28.133 --> 11:30.733
We started with Raul Esparza.

11:30.766 --> 11:34.266
Both of his parents came to
the United States from Cuba

11:34.300 --> 11:37.933
in the 1960s, as
did their parents.

11:38.966 --> 11:42.966
None of them ever returned,
but Raul has long noted that

11:43.000 --> 11:47.100
the two sides of his family
have very different attitudes

11:47.133 --> 11:50.200
toward the island
they left behind...

11:50.966 --> 11:52.176
ESPARZA: On my
mom's side, Cuba,

11:52.200 --> 11:55.433
that was like paradise lost,

11:55.466 --> 11:57.900
the most beautiful place
anyone had ever been.

11:57.933 --> 11:59.166
GATES: Mm-hmm.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.433
ESPARZA: Everybody in
Cuba used to be a prince,

12:01.466 --> 12:02.500
I guess.

12:02.533 --> 12:03.809
So that's that
side of the story.

12:03.833 --> 12:06.033
Cuba was this,
like, palace of beauty.

12:06.066 --> 12:10.466
And it was quite, um...

12:10.500 --> 12:13.233
My mom would talk about the
dances that they would go to

12:13.266 --> 12:14.833
and how much fun that was,

12:14.866 --> 12:18.866
and, like, the, uh, experience
of growing up in what seemed

12:18.900 --> 12:20.033
like a fairy tale.

12:20.066 --> 12:21.233
GATES: Right.

12:21.266 --> 12:22.309
ESPARZA: On my dad's side,
they didn't really talk about

12:22.333 --> 12:23.866
it very much.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.100
I, I didn't know why
until many years later.

12:26.133 --> 12:27.633
Many, many years later.

12:27.666 --> 12:28.700
GATES: Right.

12:28.733 --> 12:30.800
ESPARZA: And my dad would
say, "yeah, I didn't,

12:30.833 --> 12:34.633
I didn't, I don't think we need
to talk about that place.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.966
It was fine."

12:38.033 --> 12:40.866
GATES: Raul's father's
reticence was the byproduct of

12:40.900 --> 12:44.233
some very complex history.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.600
In February of 1959,
Fidel Castro became the

12:48.633 --> 12:52.266
Prime Minister of Cuba, after
leading a revolution against

12:52.300 --> 12:55.833
Fulgencio Batista, a
military dictator who'd

12:55.866 --> 12:58.966
been supported by
the United States.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.900
It was a time of great
hope for many on the island.

13:02.933 --> 13:05.200
But the new government
would soon embrace some

13:05.233 --> 13:08.300
Marxist-Leninist philosophy,

13:08.333 --> 13:12.200
and Raul's family was deeply
tied to that government.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.833
Indeed, by 1966, Raul's
grandfather was a high-level

13:16.866 --> 13:19.733
official in Cuba's
Ministry of Sugar,

13:19.766 --> 13:22.466
a position that
complicated the fact that

13:22.500 --> 13:25.733
he and his wife were growing
increasingly disaffected by

13:25.766 --> 13:30.166
conditions within the country
that he was helping to lead.

13:30.933 --> 13:34.266
Things reached a head,
according to the family,

13:34.300 --> 13:36.133
when their two sons
were expelled from

13:36.166 --> 13:38.700
the University of Havana.

13:39.766 --> 13:41.242
ESPARZA: My dad tells the
story that because he wouldn't

13:41.266 --> 13:44.600
join the party, um,
he was, he was expelled,

13:44.633 --> 13:46.966
which is why my grandmother
said she felt like...

13:47.000 --> 13:48.033
GATES: "Time to go."

13:48.066 --> 13:48.933
ESPARZA: "We're done here."

13:48.966 --> 13:49.766
GATES: Yeah.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.109
ESPARZA: "The boys
have no future."

13:51.133 --> 13:53.500
The disappointment was that
they really did think,

13:53.533 --> 13:56.966
new government,
new hope, new chance,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.966
the country could be
better than it's ever been.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.033
GATES: Right.

14:03.066 --> 14:06.400
ESPARZA: And the
disillusion was,

14:06.433 --> 14:09.700
like, that it got more
and more repressive.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.100
GATES: There are
no firm statistics,

14:13.133 --> 14:16.033
but scholars estimate that
after coming to power the

14:16.066 --> 14:20.466
Castro government
executed thousands of Cubans,

14:21.233 --> 14:24.300
many more were imprisoned,
while personal freedoms were

14:24.333 --> 14:27.666
curbed, and escape from
the island nation became

14:27.700 --> 14:30.600
increasingly difficult.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.700
Nevertheless, Raul's
grandparents were determined

14:33.733 --> 14:38.266
to leave, his grandmother
perhaps most of all,

14:39.900 --> 14:44.133
ESPARZA: My grandmother told
me about struggling to get out

14:44.166 --> 14:47.233
more than once, and
having to turn back...

14:47.266 --> 14:48.400
GATES: Ahh, okay.

14:48.433 --> 14:49.609
ESPARZA: On her own,
with the boys.

14:49.633 --> 14:52.233
And making mistakes
where they could get caught.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.400
Bumping into militia
members, bumping into,

14:54.433 --> 14:56.133
you know, ending up
in mangrove swamps,

14:56.166 --> 14:57.733
crawling through
that swamp to escape.

14:57.766 --> 14:58.800
GATES: Right.

14:58.833 --> 14:59.566
ESPARZA: They just
couldn't find the right time.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
GATES: Right.

15:00.633 --> 15:01.642
ESPARZA: And she was doing
it, my, she had told

15:01.666 --> 15:04.066
my grandfather,
"I will do this without you."

15:04.100 --> 15:05.166
GATES: Oh, wow.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.542
ESPARZA: And that's the
part I can't even imagine.

15:06.566 --> 15:07.700
GATES: Yeah.

15:07.733 --> 15:09.442
ESPARZA: My grandmother was
a really sweet, fun woman.

15:09.466 --> 15:12.966
You'd look at her and be
like, "what'd you do?"

15:15.000 --> 15:17.800
GATES: In February of 1966,

15:17.833 --> 15:21.133
Raul's grandmother
took the ultimate risk.

15:22.066 --> 15:25.833
She left Cuba in an open-air
boat with her two sons,

15:25.866 --> 15:29.166
and a handful of other
desperate women and men.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.066
For two days, they crossed
what was known as

15:33.100 --> 15:35.100
"machine gun alley",

15:35.133 --> 15:38.466
the deadly waters that
separate Cuba and Florida,

15:38.500 --> 15:41.833
patrolled by Cuban
gunboats and hungry sharks.

15:42.766 --> 15:45.866
Remarkably, a photo of
their arrival survives,

15:45.900 --> 15:48.466
taken from a helicopter
belonging to the

15:48.500 --> 15:51.533
United States Coast Guard.

15:53.866 --> 15:56.233
ESPARZA: How extraordinary.

15:56.266 --> 15:57.676
You know, the thing about
the Cuban stories is that,

15:57.700 --> 15:59.500
like, everybody feels like,

15:59.533 --> 16:01.076
"well, that story is the
exceptional one."

16:01.100 --> 16:04.233
But then you hear
thousands of that story.

16:04.266 --> 16:05.509
GATES: But this is
pretty exceptional.

16:05.533 --> 16:06.642
ESPARZA: It is pretty
exceptional, yes.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.700
I'm not saying that.

16:07.733 --> 16:11.666
It's just a, it's an entire,
it's generations of,

16:11.700 --> 16:14.966
of, of these kinds of stories
about coming to America.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.533
GATES: Raul's grandmother's
escape was all the more

16:19.566 --> 16:21.733
incredible because
she was on her own,

16:21.766 --> 16:24.133
without her husband.

16:24.166 --> 16:29.166
At the time, he was in London
as part of a Cuban delegation

16:29.200 --> 16:33.033
attending a United Nations
meeting on sugar standards,

16:33.066 --> 16:36.566
which placed him in a
frightening position.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.133
What do you think it was
like for your grandfather?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.709
ESPARZA: I can tell you that
because I know he's told me

16:41.733 --> 16:45.466
that it was, that he went,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.633
that he just went white.

16:47.666 --> 16:49.666
That he went completely
into shock about it.

16:49.700 --> 16:50.766
GATES: I bet.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.642
ESPARZA: And then, and then
fear of realizing that

16:52.666 --> 16:57.233
"my op, my options are
get out or you're,

16:57.266 --> 16:59.633
or you're in trouble."

16:59.666 --> 17:02.300
GATES: Raul's grandfather
would now make a daring

17:02.333 --> 17:04.400
escape of his own...

17:04.433 --> 17:07.233
Defecting to the
United States via Spain,

17:07.266 --> 17:10.533
likely with assistance of
one of the many anti-Castro

17:10.566 --> 17:14.466
organizations that were
supported by the CIA.

17:15.633 --> 17:17.766
Though his movements
are not documented,

17:17.800 --> 17:20.666
he would tell his story
to a subcommittee of the

17:20.700 --> 17:23.733
United States Congress
investigating the growing

17:23.766 --> 17:27.166
crisis of Cuba's refugees.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.276
ESPARZA: "The call informing
me of the arrival of my family

17:30.300 --> 17:32.866
in the United States came
precisely while I was meeting

17:32.900 --> 17:34.566
with the other delegates.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.509
These were watching me
attentively as if they wanted

17:36.533 --> 17:39.700
to guess what I was being told
from the other end of the line.

17:39.733 --> 17:42.066
Therefore, I had to take
resources from my scarce

17:42.100 --> 17:44.566
acting abilities and
pretend that this was

17:44.600 --> 17:46.766
an official call from Cuba.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.876
I chose to tell them that the
Cuban government was charging

17:48.900 --> 17:51.133
me with some additional
business that would keep me in

17:51.166 --> 17:53.500
Madrid for a few days.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.700
The Spanish authorities gave
me all kinds of assistance,

17:57.733 --> 18:00.200
which later included
personal protection.

18:00.233 --> 18:03.200
When the Ministry of Sugar
learned of my disappearance

18:03.233 --> 18:06.100
the government instructed the
Cuban embassies in Madrid and

18:06.133 --> 18:10.033
London to hunt me down and
send me back to Havana."

18:11.300 --> 18:13.133
GATES: Wow.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.509
ESPARZA: What's so
powerful about this is that i,

18:14.533 --> 18:16.800
I know this story but
you don't know the,

18:16.833 --> 18:22.800
I have never read this so
I don't know the specific,

18:22.833 --> 18:25.133
the details coming from my
own grandfather's mouth.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.433
You know?

18:26.466 --> 18:28.300
GATES: Yeah. Yeah.
Official testimony.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.076
ESPARZA: Yeah, official,
like, because it's such a

18:30.100 --> 18:32.833
complicated story
you're like, "well,

18:32.866 --> 18:35.266
that sounds like somebody's
making something up."

18:35.300 --> 18:37.300
And they didn't
make anything up.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.033
GATES: No, they
didn't make anything up.

18:41.466 --> 18:44.933
Finally reunited, Raul's
father's family settled in

18:44.966 --> 18:48.366
Florida and began to
rebuild their lives.

18:49.233 --> 18:52.933
His grandfather found work
in the local sugar industry,

18:52.966 --> 18:56.133
and though he never lost
affection for his native land,

18:56.166 --> 19:00.966
ultimately he came to love
his new home on its own terms,

19:01.766 --> 19:05.733
becoming an American citizen
when he was 56 years old.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.300
ESPARZA: "At West Palm Beach,
Florida on July 9, 1976,

19:10.333 --> 19:13.100
Raul Esparza was
admitted as a citizen of

19:13.133 --> 19:15.000
the United States of America."

19:15.033 --> 19:16.142
GATES: Have you
ever seen that?

19:16.166 --> 19:17.733
ESPARZA: No.

19:17.766 --> 19:19.300
GATES: How does
that make you feel?

19:19.333 --> 19:20.466
ESPARZA: Pretty great.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.140
GATES: You were six
years old at the time.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.866
Any recollection of that event?

19:23.900 --> 19:25.100
ESPARZA: No.

19:25.133 --> 19:27.300
No, I don't remember this event.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.066
I remember my mom's
mom becoming a citizen,

19:29.100 --> 19:31.733
but it was much,
much later in her life.

19:31.766 --> 19:33.176
GATES: What do you
think your grandfather was

19:33.200 --> 19:35.033
feeling at that moment?

19:35.066 --> 19:39.333
ESPARZA: Conflicted.
But also secure.

19:39.733 --> 19:41.866
My grandparents on
my dad's side really

19:41.900 --> 19:43.033
loved this country.

19:43.066 --> 19:44.133
GATES: Yeah.

19:44.166 --> 19:48.966
ESPARZA: They really felt very
proud and safe here.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.966
GATES: As it turns out, Raul's
grandparents weren't the

19:53.000 --> 19:54.833
first in his father's
family to make the

19:54.866 --> 19:57.366
journey to America.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.300
Moving back two
generations, we came to his

20:00.333 --> 20:05.166
great-great-grandmother,
Rosalia Gonzalez y Arencibia.

20:05.700 --> 20:10.333
On July 2, 1900, she
arrived in Boston from Havana,

20:10.366 --> 20:14.000
not as a refugee,
but as a professional.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.366
ESPARZA:
"Destination, Cambridge.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.133
Occupation, teaching."

20:19.166 --> 20:21.766
So she was a
teacher in Cambridge.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.366
Did she come to teach?

20:23.400 --> 20:25.366
GATES: Well, let's find out.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.866
Could you please turn the page?

20:28.833 --> 20:32.033
Raul, the article in front of
you was published on May 4, 1900

20:32.066 --> 20:36.033
about two months prior to
Rosalia's arrival in Cambridge.

20:36.066 --> 20:37.833
ESPARZA: I see.

20:37.866 --> 20:40.333
"Five government transports
sailing from different ports

20:40.366 --> 20:45.000
in Cuba will bring to Boston
1,450 Cuban teachers selected

20:45.033 --> 20:47.700
from all parts of the island,
rural as well as urban.

20:47.733 --> 20:49.776
These selected teachers are
to attend a summer school

20:49.800 --> 20:51.433
at Harvard University."

20:51.466 --> 20:54.766
GATES: Your great-great-
grandmother was 46 years old,

20:54.800 --> 20:57.400
married, and a mother
to seven children when

20:57.433 --> 20:58.466
she did all this.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.966
What's it like to see that?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.866
ESPARZA: Exciting.

21:01.900 --> 21:05.600
It's making me
imagine a whole life,

21:05.633 --> 21:08.033
uh, that I wasn't
even aware was happening,

21:08.066 --> 21:09.800
um, back then.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.633
It's really, really cool.

21:13.733 --> 21:16.766
GATES: Rosalía came to Harvard
as part of an effort to export

21:16.800 --> 21:20.633
the American educational
system to Cuba following its

21:20.666 --> 21:24.933
liberation from Spain in
the Spanish-American war.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.633
After six weeks,
she returned home,

21:28.666 --> 21:32.133
and resumed her
career as a teacher.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.466
She also began publishing
articles in a variety of

21:34.500 --> 21:37.933
magazines, often
using a pseudonym,

21:37.966 --> 21:41.133
a common practice for
female writers at the time.

21:42.066 --> 21:43.066
Did you have any idea...

21:43.100 --> 21:44.033
ESPARZA: Nope.

21:44.066 --> 21:45.576
GATES: That you had an
ancestor who's a writer?

21:45.600 --> 21:47.133
ESPARZA: No.
I mean, no.

21:47.166 --> 21:48.166
She sounds fantastic.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.133
GATES: Yeah.

21:49.166 --> 21:52.066
ESPARZA: And, uh, to
think of a mother,

21:52.100 --> 21:56.433
a woman at this time, now
it would be a big deal.

21:56.466 --> 22:00.233
Then it's exponentially so.

22:00.266 --> 22:01.633
GATES: Oh my god, yeah.

22:01.666 --> 22:04.200
ESPARZA: That's
really kind of amazing.

22:04.866 --> 22:07.466
GATES: We had one
more surprise for Raul.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.433
In Havana, we uncovered the
baptismal record for Rosalia's

22:11.466 --> 22:16.133
father, Manuel de
Jesus Gonzalez Cabrera.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.633
This is the oldest document
that we could find for Raul's

22:20.666 --> 22:25.066
ancestors in Cuba, and it
illuminates his deep roots in

22:25.100 --> 22:28.066
a place he's never been.

22:29.866 --> 22:31.333
ESPARZA: That's crazy, man.

22:31.366 --> 22:33.233
The weight of that
much history is like...

22:33.266 --> 22:34.300
GATES: Oh, yeah.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.100
ESPARZA: You know what I mean?
How amazing.

22:36.133 --> 22:39.200
GATES: And that also tells us
the names of Manuel's parents.

22:39.233 --> 22:42.033
ESPARZA: Antonio Gonzalez
and Juana Josepha Cabrera.

22:42.066 --> 22:43.166
GATES: Yes.

22:43.200 --> 22:47.466
Antonio and Juana are your
fourth great-grandparents.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.700
Great-great-great-
great-grandparents.

22:49.733 --> 22:52.300
ESPARZA: That's
tremendously interesting.

22:52.333 --> 22:53.976
GATES: Did you have any
idea that you had roots on the

22:54.000 --> 22:55.633
island that went back that far?

22:55.666 --> 22:57.633
ESPARZA: No. No,
I always wondered,

22:57.666 --> 23:02.233
like, how connected
were we really to Cuba.

23:02.266 --> 23:03.100
Quite.

23:03.133 --> 23:06.600
GATES: Connected. Conexión.

23:06.633 --> 23:07.400
ESPARZA: Yeah.

23:07.433 --> 23:08.566
GATES: What are you feeling?

23:08.600 --> 23:10.733
ESPARZA: I feel,
I'm very, I'm moved,

23:10.766 --> 23:14.600
and I'm also very, very proud.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.576
You just keep thinking
"I'm part of that.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.366
Look what they did. Wow.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.733
Look what I come from.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.100
Look what they accomplished?"

23:22.133 --> 23:27.366
That's, um, feels
very comforting.

23:29.733 --> 23:32.500
GATES: Like Raul, David Chang
grew up wondering about a

23:32.533 --> 23:35.433
homeland that he
hasn't ever seen...

23:39.433 --> 23:42.233
His parents were both born
in what is now North Korea,

23:42.266 --> 23:45.366
and both left as young people
amidst the chaos of

23:45.400 --> 23:49.200
the Korean War, never to return.

23:51.166 --> 23:54.266
But while Raul grew up
hearing stories about Cuba,

23:54.300 --> 23:58.333
David's family rarely spoke
about their lives in Korea.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.633
David knows that his father
and mother came from very

24:02.666 --> 24:04.466
different backgrounds,

24:04.500 --> 24:07.700
but that's where his
understanding ends.

24:08.833 --> 24:12.066
CHANG: I divide it in, my
mom's side of well-to-do,

24:12.100 --> 24:14.533
you know, I know
my mom grew up in,

24:14.566 --> 24:16.066
like, in a castle, right?

24:16.100 --> 24:17.133
GATES: Uh-huh.

24:17.166 --> 24:18.276
CHANG: I saw a photo of it.
I was like, "what?"

24:18.300 --> 24:21.366
And my dad's side is
basically just hustlers.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.533
That's how i,
that's how I divided it.

24:23.566 --> 24:25.700
And I don't know
anything other than that.

24:25.733 --> 24:27.133
GATES: Why
didn't you ever ask?

24:27.166 --> 24:29.166
CHANG: I don't know.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.833
I think it was a
sense of sorrow.

24:32.866 --> 24:36.066
I mean, you know stuff happened.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.133
GATES: Right.

24:37.166 --> 24:40.466
CHANG: And if it
came out great,

24:40.500 --> 24:41.800
we wouldn't be in this country.

24:41.833 --> 24:42.733
GATES: Yeah.

24:42.766 --> 24:44.966
CHANG: And I think
that was sort of, like,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.566
deeply rooted in me as
to don't ask these questions.

24:51.100 --> 24:53.466
GATES: As we set out to
trace David's ancestry,

24:53.500 --> 24:56.900
we soon discovered that his
parents were not actually the

24:56.933 --> 25:00.533
first members of his
family to cross the globe

25:00.566 --> 25:02.833
in search of a better life.

25:02.866 --> 25:07.133
That title belongs to David's
maternal great-grandfather,

25:07.166 --> 25:10.200
a man named Woo Sang Yong.

25:10.966 --> 25:14.166
Sang Yong was born
in the late 1800s in

25:14.200 --> 25:16.900
what is now North Korea.

25:17.566 --> 25:21.033
In 1910, when he was
roughly 16 years old,

25:21.066 --> 25:25.000
Japan annexed Korea, and its
people became second-class

25:25.033 --> 25:28.333
subjects of the Japanese empire.

25:29.366 --> 25:31.933
It was a dark time
in Korean history,

25:31.966 --> 25:35.633
but Sang Yong didn't
have to endure it for long.

25:36.066 --> 25:39.433
In 1920, he was sent to
the United States to study

25:39.466 --> 25:43.766
theology, chosen, according
to a newspaper article,

25:43.800 --> 25:47.100
by the methodist church
for his quote-unquote

25:47.133 --> 25:50.400
"exceptional future prospects".

25:52.200 --> 25:55.200
CHANG: I can't even
stress how crazy this is.

25:55.233 --> 25:58.300
GATES: 101 years ago,
that article was published.

25:58.333 --> 26:01.166
CHANG: That's so wild.

26:01.866 --> 26:03.776
GATES: Think about how
rare that opportunity was.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.400
I mean, this is the beginning
of the jazz age, man.

26:06.433 --> 26:08.533
This was a century ago.

26:08.566 --> 26:10.600
He must've been
extraordinary to have

26:10.633 --> 26:13.100
been chosen for this program.

26:13.133 --> 26:15.733
CHANG: I don't even...

26:15.766 --> 26:19.700
GATES: And it had to be a little
bit like going to mars, I mean.

26:19.733 --> 26:21.333
CHANG: I don't have words.

26:21.366 --> 26:23.866
I mean, I have goosebumps.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.266
GATES: Sang Yong came to
America leaving behind

26:26.300 --> 26:29.600
a wife and a young son.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.800
We don't know how long
he intended to stay,

26:31.833 --> 26:35.800
but it's highly unlikely that
anyone imagined the future

26:35.833 --> 26:38.166
that lay ahead.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.600
In 1925, a full five
years after his arrival,

26:42.633 --> 26:45.233
he received a certificate
in theology from

26:45.266 --> 26:48.333
Southern Methodist
University in Dallas,

26:48.366 --> 26:51.033
but he wasn't ready to go home.

26:51.066 --> 26:53.400
That same year, he
was admitted to the

26:53.433 --> 26:55.933
Yale Divinity School!

26:55.966 --> 26:58.466
We found his
application which describes,

26:58.500 --> 27:02.300
in his own words,
his amazing journey...

27:03.433 --> 27:06.433
CHANG: Wow.
This is so crazy.

27:06.466 --> 27:09.100
Oh my goodness.

27:09.133 --> 27:11.133
"I spent many years
studying the classics

27:11.166 --> 27:12.600
and poetry in Korea.

27:12.633 --> 27:15.700
Then I went to high school and
from there to normal school

27:15.733 --> 27:18.233
where I stayed two years and
would have stayed longer had

27:18.266 --> 27:21.566
the school not closed
because of lack of funds.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.700
My work in college has been
the prescribed work for a

27:23.733 --> 27:25.300
degree in theology."

27:25.333 --> 27:27.266
Wow.

27:27.300 --> 27:30.333
This is all news to me,

27:30.366 --> 27:34.633
and I'm trying to imagine

27:34.666 --> 27:40.833
his life in America as a student
with a wife and a young son

27:40.866 --> 27:43.433
back in Korea, spending all
this time in America.

27:43.466 --> 27:45.133
GATES: Mmm.

27:45.166 --> 27:49.600
Oh, it had to be lonely and
culture shock and alienation.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.633
And nobody talked about it?

27:52.666 --> 27:57.333
CHANG: No. No. No.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.000
That's a lot to take in.

28:01.866 --> 28:05.733
GATES: This story was about
to make a surprising turn.

28:05.766 --> 28:09.800
Sang Yong arrived at
Yale in the fall of 1925,

28:09.833 --> 28:13.300
but soon developed a
serious respiratory condition.

28:13.333 --> 28:16.366
Doctors recommended
that he return to Korea,

28:16.400 --> 28:19.500
but he didn't
follow their advice.

28:19.533 --> 28:22.800
Instead, he connected with two
other expatriate Koreans and

28:22.833 --> 28:25.500
essentially became
an entrepreneur,

28:25.533 --> 28:28.933
opening a series of Asian-themed
gardening businesses

28:28.966 --> 28:31.366
throughout the United States.

28:32.533 --> 28:34.800
CHANG: "Mr. S.Y. Woo was
told he would have to have

28:34.833 --> 28:37.966
a delicate and expensive
nose operation.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.800
To raise the money, they
decided to open a small

28:40.833 --> 28:43.066
gift shop during the
Christmas holiday season.

28:43.100 --> 28:46.166
Then things began to
happen in bunches.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.166
The Depression struck
and demand for the

28:48.200 --> 28:50.033
luxury gardens fell.

28:50.066 --> 28:52.866
Woo sold his store and opened
a greenhouse in Cleveland..."

In Cleveland?
What the hell is happening?

"In 1931, the JL Hudson
company of Detroit invited Woo

29:00.900 --> 29:04.500
to open a Chinese garden
department in their store.

29:04.533 --> 29:09.000
Woo accepted, and soon the
family was together again."

29:11.033 --> 29:12.700

29:12.733 --> 29:14.966
So, he's, he's just hustling.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.066
GATES: Mm-hmm.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.200
CHANG: What is shocking
is I didn't think the

29:18.233 --> 29:22.000
entrepreneurial thing
came from my mom's side.

29:22.033 --> 29:23.300
GATES: Right.

CHANG: But I'm wrong.
I'm happily wrong.

29:35.233 --> 29:38.800
GATES: Unfortunately, Sang
Yong's travels would reach

29:38.833 --> 29:40.666
a tragic end.

29:40.700 --> 29:45.166
After World War II, he
found himself back in Korea,

29:45.200 --> 29:47.233
where, in the wake
of Japan's defeat,

29:47.266 --> 29:49.833
his homeland had been
partitioned into a

29:49.866 --> 29:53.200
communist north backed
by the Soviet Union,

29:53.233 --> 29:57.133
and a capitalist south,
allied with the United States.

29:58.466 --> 30:00.700
There was a great demand in
the south for Koreans who

30:00.733 --> 30:03.900
spoke english, and,
ever resourceful,

30:03.933 --> 30:06.700
Sang Yong obtained
work as a guide for

30:06.733 --> 30:09.633
American soldiers and civilians.

30:09.666 --> 30:13.233
That decision would
lead to his death.

30:15.533 --> 30:17.266
CHANG: "Coming back
from a boar hunt,

30:17.300 --> 30:19.109
the jeep in which he was
riding with Americans was

30:19.133 --> 30:20.933
sideswiped by a Korean truck.

30:20.966 --> 30:24.000
Mr. Woo was the only
one seriously injured.

30:24.033 --> 30:28.000
He was unconscious, of course,

30:28.033 --> 30:30.333
American hunting companions
were able to secure an

ambulance and take him

While we sat and
waited for the verdict,

30:35.700 --> 30:37.400
the American doctors
gave him first aid,

30:37.433 --> 30:39.133
set his arm and
then, surprisingly,

30:39.166 --> 30:40.700
said they could do no more.

30:40.733 --> 30:43.766
The rules, they said, were
first that they were not to

30:43.800 --> 30:46.733
treat Koreans."

30:49.433 --> 30:51.833
They couldn't do any
more because he was Korean?

30:51.866 --> 30:52.933
GATES: Yeah.

30:52.966 --> 30:54.533
Get this:
according to the article,

30:54.566 --> 30:58.200
the doctors were under combat
regulations and could've done

30:58.233 --> 31:01.800
more to save him, but didn't,
because the doctors didn't

31:01.833 --> 31:04.766
want to get into trouble.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.533
Now, what kind of doctor is
not going to save another

31:09.566 --> 31:11.433
human being?

31:11.466 --> 31:13.400
CHANG: That's unfortunate.

GATES: Well, it's,
it's disgusting.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.133
CHANG: You know, I just, I
didn't even contemplate

31:20.166 --> 31:22.266
or imagine his death.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.600
GATES: Uh-huh.

31:23.633 --> 31:26.266
CHANG: That it
could be like this.

31:27.733 --> 31:30.700
I mean, no surprise, i,
I barely knew his life.

31:30.733 --> 31:32.300
Why would I know his death?

31:32.333 --> 31:34.166
GATES: Yeah, of course, yeah.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.809
But you never would've,
you couldn't have guessed.

31:35.833 --> 31:38.366
CHANG: Well, he lived
a full life, for sure.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.809
GATES: He lived a full life.
He did indeed.

31:39.833 --> 31:42.433
CHANG: Unbelievable.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.766
GATES: There was one
final beat to this story.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.600
As we combed through the records
that Sang Yong left behind,

31:49.633 --> 31:52.533
we noticed that in
his application to Yale,

31:52.566 --> 31:56.266
he named his father,
which ultimately allowed us to

31:56.300 --> 32:01.900
identify his father, who was
likely born in the mid-1800s.

32:02.833 --> 32:06.133
Giving David the chance to
glimpse two more rungs

32:06.166 --> 32:08.633
on his family tree!

32:08.666 --> 32:10.266
Have you ever heard
their names before,

32:10.300 --> 32:11.933
or heard anything about them?

32:11.966 --> 32:14.200
CHANG: I never even
thought of their existence.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.233
GATES: Yeah.

32:16.266 --> 32:17.800
Well, your second
great-grandfather,

32:17.833 --> 32:21.133
your great-great-grandfather,
was a farmer and a merchant

32:21.166 --> 32:24.666
who supported his son's family
while his son was studying for

32:24.700 --> 32:27.533
ten years in the
United States of America.

32:27.566 --> 32:30.633
And you had no idea.

32:33.033 --> 32:36.966
CHANG: I was, i,
I mean, I was, like,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.666
pretty sure there was
some farmer in my family.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.033
GATES: Right.

32:41.066 --> 32:43.076
CHANG: But I didn't know how
far back it was going to go.

32:43.100 --> 32:45.466
You know?
This is amazing.

32:45.500 --> 32:46.700
GATES: Mmm.

32:46.733 --> 32:50.533
CHANG: It makes me proud, and
that's a word I never really

32:50.566 --> 32:53.066
use to describe my family.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.833
GATES: Why not?

32:54.866 --> 32:57.700
CHANG: I just never
had that connection.

32:57.733 --> 32:59.100
GATES: Mm-hmm.

32:59.133 --> 33:03.266
CHANG: I think a lot of it was
my own sort of projection of

33:03.300 --> 33:06.266
maybe being Korean in America,
how would I know that there

33:06.300 --> 33:07.700
was this rich history that

33:07.733 --> 33:10.300
even spent a lot
of time in America?

33:10.333 --> 33:11.833
GATES: Right.

33:11.866 --> 33:14.766
What does that journey,
from them to you,

33:14.800 --> 33:17.700
mean to you?

33:21.000 --> 33:26.166
CHANG: I think it means that
I got to do better, you know?

33:26.200 --> 33:28.400
Whatever it is I do that,

33:28.433 --> 33:32.533
a lot of things by chance

33:32.566 --> 33:38.200
and just events and hardships
and amazing things have all,

33:38.233 --> 33:42.333
like, all this life
happened for me to have this

33:42.366 --> 33:44.733
opportunities, these
opportunities that I have,

33:44.766 --> 33:49.466
and just my, my, my overriding
sense of who I am tells me

33:49.500 --> 33:53.133
that i, i, more than ever,
that I need to just not

33:53.166 --> 33:55.766
squander these opportunities.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.566
GATES: We had already
surprised Raul Esparza by

34:01.600 --> 34:06.066
tracing his paternal roots
in Cuba back two centuries.

34:06.633 --> 34:10.500
Now, we had a very different
kind of surprise to share.

34:10.533 --> 34:13.066
Following his
mother's father's line,

34:13.100 --> 34:15.700
we found
ourselves far from Cuba,

34:15.733 --> 34:18.366
in the Catalonian
region of Spain,

34:18.400 --> 34:20.933
where Raul's ancestors
were doing something

34:20.966 --> 34:23.900
quite unexpected...

34:24.300 --> 34:26.766
ESPARZA: "Luis Garcia de Pou,
occupation, commerce.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.800
Francisca de Pou Agusti,
occupation, owner."

34:30.833 --> 34:33.866
GATES: Raul, this tells us that
your second great-grandmother,

34:33.900 --> 34:36.833
Francisca, your
great-grandfather Luis,

34:36.866 --> 34:41.033
and your great-granduncles
Julio and Emilio,

34:41.066 --> 34:43.033
were all engaged in
commerce, quote-unquote.

34:43.066 --> 34:44.400
ESPARZA: Commerce. Yeah.

34:44.433 --> 34:46.766
GATES: Any idea
what type of commerce?

34:46.800 --> 34:47.833
ESPARZA: No.

34:47.866 --> 34:49.066
GATES: Well, let's find out.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.066
ESPARZA: Okay.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.266
GATES: Would you
please turn the page?

34:52.300 --> 34:54.933
Would you please read
the translated section?

34:54.966 --> 34:56.766
ESPARZA: "In 1884,
Luis Garcia de Crespi,

34:56.800 --> 34:59.400
first chief of the
Figueres railroad station,

34:59.433 --> 35:01.766
opened a paper bag factory.

35:01.800 --> 35:06.133
He came from Valencia and like
a good entrepreneur started

35:06.166 --> 35:08.566
different businesses before
realizing that the workshop

35:08.600 --> 35:10.133
had a future.

35:10.166 --> 35:12.900
He married Francisca de Pou,
which is why he named his

35:12.933 --> 35:15.300
new business Garcia de Pou."

35:15.333 --> 35:17.633
GATES: That is your
great-great-grandfather.

35:17.666 --> 35:18.842
ESPARZA:
Great-great-grandfather?

35:18.866 --> 35:22.000
GATES: Yes. And he founded
your family's company.

35:22.033 --> 35:25.633
You can see his photo
right there on the left.

35:25.666 --> 35:31.100
ESPARZA: How cool. Wow.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.633
GATES: The story of this
branch of Raul's family is

35:35.666 --> 35:38.633
set down in a wealth of
corporate documents,

35:38.666 --> 35:43.533
newspaper accounts, and even a
book on Catalonian industry...

35:44.400 --> 35:48.133
It seems that over the years,
Luis and his wife Francisca

35:48.166 --> 35:52.266
ran a cement company
and a paper bag factory,

35:52.300 --> 35:55.700
a factory that began as a
workshop in their own home.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.333
ESPARZA: Paper bags?

35:59.366 --> 36:00.700
GATES: Paper bags.

36:00.733 --> 36:03.900
Catalonia was an important
paper-making area because of

36:03.933 --> 36:08.866
two main factors: large demand
spurred by high population and

36:08.900 --> 36:12.866
access to natural
resources like clean water.

36:12.900 --> 36:15.000
So your ancestors must
have seen an opportunity for

36:15.033 --> 36:17.933
themselves and they went for it.

36:17.966 --> 36:19.509
ESPARZA: I guess you
don't even think about...

36:19.533 --> 36:22.333
You're talking about paper
bags and I'm going I guess

36:22.366 --> 36:24.066
I always thought
they always existed.

36:24.100 --> 36:27.333
Paper bags just
are in the world.

36:28.700 --> 36:31.333
GATES: Raul's ancestors may
have chosen to take their

36:31.366 --> 36:34.266
chances on rather
mundane products,

36:34.300 --> 36:37.333
but the gamble paid off.

36:37.366 --> 36:40.900
They soon had at
least 60 employees!

36:41.400 --> 36:44.466
Unfortunately, in July of 1900,

36:44.500 --> 36:49.066
Luis died unexpectedly,
leaving Francisca as one of a

36:49.100 --> 36:52.933
tiny minority of women
running companies in Spain

36:52.966 --> 36:54.866
at that time...

36:54.900 --> 36:57.900
It was a daunting challenge.

36:58.866 --> 37:01.566
She would have been a 42 year
old widow with three sons.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.533
ESPARZA: Yeah.

37:02.566 --> 37:04.009
GATES: It couldn't
have been easy for her.

37:04.033 --> 37:06.042
I mean, think about it: she was
running at least two businesses

37:06.066 --> 37:08.733
simultaneously at a time
when women were still

37:08.766 --> 37:12.466
largely relegated to jobs in
domestic service and retail,

37:12.500 --> 37:14.533
if they were allowed
out of the house...

37:14.566 --> 37:15.533
ESPARZA: Yeah.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.933
GATES: At all.
She had to be one tough lady.

37:17.966 --> 37:19.800
ESPARZA: Yeah.

37:21.966 --> 37:25.166
GATES: Francisca would prove
to be both tough, and savvy.

37:25.900 --> 37:29.533
Under her watch, the paper
company became wholesalers,

37:29.566 --> 37:32.066
selling wrapping
for food products,

37:32.100 --> 37:34.733
and continued to thrive...

37:34.766 --> 37:37.600
But when it came time for
Francisca to hand over the

37:37.633 --> 37:41.966
business to her eldest son,
Raul's great-grandfather,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.900
she was less successful.

37:44.933 --> 37:47.200
His interests, it seems,
lay elsewhere.

37:47.633 --> 37:51.100
As evidenced by the
1906 census for Spain.

37:52.533 --> 37:55.200
ESPARZA: "Luis Garcia
de Pou, 25, single,

37:55.233 --> 37:58.333
occupation: bohemian."

37:58.366 --> 37:59.933
GATES: The census
taker described your

37:59.966 --> 38:04.533
great-grandfather's occupation
as that of a bohemian.

38:04.566 --> 38:05.833
ESPARZA: A bohemian.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.600
GATES: Not as a cement maker.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.500
ESPARZA: No, not a
cement or paper bag maker,

38:09.533 --> 38:11.966
unless he was
wearing paper bags.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.066
GATES: That's a good one.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.166
What do you make of that?

38:15.200 --> 38:16.676
ESPARZA: I'm surprised
by it because bohemio is

38:16.700 --> 38:18.333
definitely, uh...

38:18.366 --> 38:20.200
That is a phrase
they've used about me.

38:20.233 --> 38:25.900
My grandmother has said to
me, "muy bohemio," which is...

38:25.933 --> 38:27.266
GATES: Yeah, yeah.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.533
It doesn't sound like it is, um,

38:29.566 --> 38:32.300
a term of praise or
admiration in 1906.

38:32.333 --> 38:34.933
ESPARZA: No.
He's, uh, not a realist.

38:34.966 --> 38:38.600
Uh, "artistic temperament"
is what bohemio always

38:38.633 --> 38:42.100
makes me think of.
Or a vagabond.

38:44.766 --> 38:47.966
GATES: Raul was curious as to
how his "bohemian" ancestor

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
spent his time.

38:50.033 --> 38:52.800
According to Catalonian
newspapers from the era,

38:52.833 --> 38:57.366
it seems he ran an organization
for young artists.

38:59.166 --> 39:01.633
We're not exactly sure
what the organization did...

39:01.666 --> 39:02.700
ESPARZA: I wonder.

39:02.733 --> 39:04.409
GATES: But its goal,
seemingly, was to create

39:04.433 --> 39:06.700
and encourage
as many artists as possible.

39:06.733 --> 39:08.600
What in the world
do you make of that?

39:08.633 --> 39:11.566
And could you have any idea
that on your family tree was

39:11.600 --> 39:13.466
an ancestor like this?

39:13.500 --> 39:15.200
ESPARZA: No, not at all.
Not at all.

39:15.233 --> 39:16.200
GATES: Huh.

39:16.233 --> 39:17.276
ESPARZA: And I've
always wondered,

39:17.300 --> 39:19.100
like, where did I get
this interest from,

39:19.133 --> 39:24.700
or this, uh, attachment
to, to the arts that I have.

39:25.033 --> 39:26.876
GATES: It was in your blood
and you didn't even know.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.100
ESPARZA: I had no idea.

39:28.133 --> 39:31.100
GATES: You've been informed
by things your ancestors have

39:31.133 --> 39:34.100
done osmotically,
though you didn't know.

39:34.133 --> 39:37.000
ESPARZA: It's so, but it, what
it feels like is delightful.

39:37.033 --> 39:40.700
Um, I mean, I have no idea
what the thing is itself,

39:40.733 --> 39:45.333
but it's delightful to, um,

39:45.366 --> 39:48.966
imagine how important
this must have felt

39:49.000 --> 39:50.733
to, to them, I guess,

39:50.766 --> 39:52.900
to make this
organization at the time,

39:52.933 --> 39:56.233
and delightful to make a small
connection that I've always

39:56.266 --> 39:58.733
wondered about for myself.

40:00.666 --> 40:04.133
GATES: Perhaps unsurprisingly,
Raul's great-grandfather

40:04.166 --> 40:07.233
didn't stay a bohemian forever.

40:07.266 --> 40:10.400
He eventually
married, had a child,

40:10.433 --> 40:13.766
and took over the company
his parents had founded.

40:14.633 --> 40:18.266
But even so: he
remained a restless soul.

40:18.900 --> 40:23.100
Sometime around 1916, Louis
left the paper business behind

40:23.133 --> 40:26.533
yet again, and emigrated
to Cuba with his family,

40:26.566 --> 40:29.566
where his son,
Raul's grandfather,

40:29.600 --> 40:33.366
would become a bookkeeper, and
eventually flee Cuba for the

40:33.400 --> 40:36.433
United States, bringing
the story of this line of

40:36.466 --> 40:40.200
Raul's ancestry up
to his own birth.

40:41.633 --> 40:43.866
But there was still a
question in front of us:

40:43.900 --> 40:47.133
what happened to the family
company back in Spain?

40:47.933 --> 40:50.566
The answer surprised us both.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.733
ESPARZA: "Garcia de Pou, with
headquarters and factory in

40:54.766 --> 40:58.466
Vilasacra, sells all kinds of
single-use paper products

40:58.500 --> 41:02.800
like napkins, coasters and
paper towels to restoration

41:02.833 --> 41:06.866
companies, hotels, hospitals,
and airplane companies."

41:06.900 --> 41:08.200
They did just fine.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.600
GATES: The company is
still in operation.

41:10.633 --> 41:11.800
ESPARZA: That's crazy.

41:11.833 --> 41:13.409
GATES: And not only that,
it is still owned and

41:13.433 --> 41:15.766
operated by your family.
Look at it on the left.

41:15.800 --> 41:16.700
ESPARZA: It's gigantic.

41:16.733 --> 41:17.909
GATES: That's
its headquarters.

41:17.933 --> 41:19.800
ESPARZA: Maybe I
should go into paper work.

41:19.833 --> 41:22.133
Look at that.

41:22.166 --> 41:26.366
GATES: Your family's company
currently has 400 employees...

41:26.400 --> 41:28.666
ESPARZA: That's amazing.

41:28.700 --> 41:31.000
GATES: More than
25,000 clients,

41:31.033 --> 41:35.500
and exports its paper
products to over 50 countries.

41:37.966 --> 41:40.200
ESPARZA: This is crazy.

41:41.433 --> 41:45.333
GATES: We had one more
detail to share with Raul.

41:45.366 --> 41:46.942
When we looked into his
great-great-grandmother

41:46.966 --> 41:50.333
Francisca's roots, we
discovered that she had been

41:50.366 --> 41:54.000
born in the tiny
town of Navata, Spain,

41:54.033 --> 41:58.000
where, incredibly,
Raul's family can be

41:58.033 --> 42:01.566
traced back 14 generations.

42:03.666 --> 42:04.876
ESPARZA: It's like looking
through a fog at the past

42:04.900 --> 42:06.266
all of a sudden.

42:06.300 --> 42:07.500
Look at that.

42:07.533 --> 42:08.676
GATES: Yeah.
It's pretty cool.

42:08.700 --> 42:09.909
ESPARZA: That is
really wonderful.

42:09.933 --> 42:13.266
GATES: They have lived in
Navata at least since 1635.

42:13.300 --> 42:14.266
ESPARZA: Yeah.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.409
GATES: What's it
like to know your,

42:15.433 --> 42:19.733
that your roots go back so
deeply in this one place?

42:19.766 --> 42:21.433
ESPARZA: I think
it's marvelous.

42:21.466 --> 42:22.466
GATES: They didn't move.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.666
ESPARZA: They didn't move.
Stubborn Spaniards.

42:26.900 --> 42:30.266
But, um, how stable and
extraordinarily consistent.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.466
My god.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.766
And that's just, like, I was
already kind of blown away

42:35.800 --> 42:37.366
when we were
talking 19th century.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.766
Now I'm looking at...

42:38.800 --> 42:40.233
GATES: 17th century.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.342
ESPARZA: 17th century and
it just feels like, "what?"

42:42.366 --> 42:43.533
GATES: Mm-hmm.

42:43.566 --> 42:49.000
ESPARZA: It's, uh, spectacular
to see such an incredibly

42:49.033 --> 42:50.800
strong connection to one place.

42:50.833 --> 42:52.000
GATES: Right.

42:52.033 --> 42:54.700
ESPARZA: Because the Cuba
foundation is really fragile.

42:54.733 --> 42:57.400
You know?

42:57.433 --> 42:58.909
This is centuries and
centuries and centuries...

42:58.933 --> 42:59.833
GATES: Right.

42:59.866 --> 43:01.633
ESPARZA: Of life, in a place.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.033
Because Cuba's the
place they left.

43:03.066 --> 43:04.266
GATES: Yeah.

43:04.300 --> 43:06.566
ESPARZA: How magnificent.

43:07.600 --> 43:10.133
GATES: We had already explored
how David Chang's maternal

43:10.166 --> 43:14.200
ancestors left Korea for
the uncertainty of America.

43:15.033 --> 43:18.033
Now, turning to
his father's roots,

43:18.066 --> 43:21.633
we found ourselves
retracing that same journey,

43:21.666 --> 43:24.233
but from a very
different perspective.

43:25.566 --> 43:29.533
David's father, Chang Jin Pil,
came to the United States in

43:29.566 --> 43:33.366
the early 1960s
with no safety net,

43:33.866 --> 43:37.366
and spent years working
menial jobs in restaurants.

43:37.833 --> 43:40.300
Though he would ultimately
own several businesses,

43:40.333 --> 43:43.100
none brought him
lasting prosperity,

43:43.133 --> 43:48.700
or peace, and David is still
struggling to understand him.

43:50.933 --> 43:52.942
CHANG: You know, what's funny
is my brothers were telling me

43:52.966 --> 43:55.300
"your dad gets better
when you get older."

43:55.333 --> 43:56.300
GATES: Uh-huh.

43:56.333 --> 43:57.409
CHANG: When you
turn a certain age,

43:57.433 --> 43:58.566
and I was like, "whatever."

43:58.600 --> 43:59.733
GATES: Uh-huh.

43:59.766 --> 44:03.300
CHANG: But it dawned on me:
he didn't have any way of

44:03.333 --> 44:06.533
communicating with some
kids growing up in America,

44:06.566 --> 44:08.566
with American values.

44:08.600 --> 44:10.966
And whatever his life was,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.500
there was no way
for him to relate.

44:13.533 --> 44:14.666
GATES: Mm-hmm.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.009
CHANG: And when I
think of my dad,

44:16.033 --> 44:18.300
I say it lovingly,
and it's how I phrase,

44:18.333 --> 44:20.866
like, I think about a lot
of his side of the family,

44:20.900 --> 44:24.300
but more so my dad, I just
think about that guy hustling,

44:24.333 --> 44:27.000
always, to find a way
to make something work.

44:27.033 --> 44:28.000
GATES: Right.

44:28.033 --> 44:31.566
CHANG: Yeah. Finding a
way against all odds.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.200
GATES: David's father rarely
spoke about his personal life

44:36.233 --> 44:39.266
other than to say that his
childhood in Korea was a

44:39.300 --> 44:43.933
hard one, and all evidence
suggests he was right...

44:44.833 --> 44:48.733
Jin Pil was born in 1942
and came of age during

44:48.766 --> 44:52.200
the Korean War, a cataclysm
that caused roughly

44:52.233 --> 44:54.733
three million casualties,

44:54.766 --> 44:59.500
and made refugees of at
least another million more.

45:01.166 --> 45:04.133
David gleaned some insight
into just how difficult these

45:04.166 --> 45:07.733
years were by observing
his paternal grandmother,

45:07.766 --> 45:11.300
who followed her son
to the United States.

45:12.700 --> 45:16.400
She was strict, religious,
and extraordinarily frugal.

45:17.633 --> 45:20.933
As children will do, David and
his siblings mocked her for

45:20.966 --> 45:22.800
being so different.

45:22.833 --> 45:26.400
But as he matured, David
realized that her habits were

45:26.433 --> 45:29.500
the residue of
great suffering...

45:31.166 --> 45:34.366
CHANG: I feel remorseful that
we made so much fun of her,

45:34.400 --> 45:36.033
you know?

45:36.066 --> 45:37.276
She had no idea
what we were saying.

45:37.300 --> 45:40.266
She only spoke Korean, and
she would always wear the

45:40.300 --> 45:42.800
Korean hanbok, the
traditional dress.

45:42.833 --> 45:45.933
And she was so tiny.

45:45.966 --> 45:49.933
And she just was so hardcore.

45:50.633 --> 45:54.266
And I remember when
we would make rice,

45:54.300 --> 45:56.100
and if there was
any leftover rice,

45:56.133 --> 46:01.166
she would make sure that every
grain of rice was dried out

46:01.200 --> 46:04.466
on the, on the, on
the deck outside.

46:04.500 --> 46:05.600
GATES: Huh.

46:05.633 --> 46:07.866
CHANG: All the time.

46:07.900 --> 46:09.600
And my brother and
I were just like,

46:09.633 --> 46:12.100
"what the hell is she doing?"

46:12.133 --> 46:13.366
GATES: Right.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.809
CHANG: And she would do
that with a lot of food,

46:14.833 --> 46:17.033
but I just remember the rice.

46:17.066 --> 46:19.566
And she would never let
anything be thrown away.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.933
Ever.

46:21.966 --> 46:26.333
And she would then use that
rice to put something in her

46:26.366 --> 46:28.733
barley tea, you know?

46:28.766 --> 46:29.866
GATES: Uh-huh.

46:29.900 --> 46:32.066
CHANG: It was just
so weird to me then.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.633
It's still a little
bit weird to me now.

46:34.666 --> 46:36.900
And how opposite it was from my,

46:36.933 --> 46:43.133
my mom's mom, who has the more

46:43.166 --> 46:47.366
sort of like loving, maternal
instinct type of thing.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.266
GATES: Right. Uh-huh.

46:49.300 --> 46:51.233
CHANG: And that was much
more easily accepted and

46:51.266 --> 46:53.900
understood by us, the siblings.

46:53.933 --> 46:57.433
Whereas my mom, my
dad's mom, I think, was

46:57.466 --> 47:00.433
trying to show love by just
teaching us how to survive.

47:00.466 --> 47:01.700
GATES: Uh-huh.

47:01.733 --> 47:03.233
CHANG: That's how I feel.

47:03.266 --> 47:05.866
GATES: Well, survival was
in, the need to survive,

47:05.900 --> 47:08.966
the desperate need to
survive was in her DNA.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.766
CHANG: Yes.

47:12.300 --> 47:14.000
GATES: Given the
barriers between them,

47:14.033 --> 47:17.233
it's not surprising that David
knew almost nothing about his

47:17.266 --> 47:20.933
father's deeper roots, and
due to the challenges of

47:20.966 --> 47:23.466
conducting
research in North Korea,

47:23.500 --> 47:26.100
we expected that we would
be able to add little

47:26.133 --> 47:28.033
to his knowledge.

47:28.066 --> 47:30.233
But we were wrong.

47:30.266 --> 47:32.700
David has distant relatives
who have preserved the

47:32.733 --> 47:37.066
family's jokbo, a written
genealogy that allowed us to

47:37.100 --> 47:41.333
tie David to one of
Korea's ancient clans,

47:41.366 --> 47:44.200
founded by a man
named Chang Jeong Pil

47:44.233 --> 47:47.533
over 1,000 years ago...

47:48.966 --> 47:51.400
CHANG: This is,
like, unbelievable.

47:51.433 --> 47:54.533
It's funny, the, the biggest
thing that I'm thinking of is

47:54.566 --> 47:56.566
that my dad's
middle name is Pil.

47:56.600 --> 47:57.833
GATES: Uh-huh.

47:57.866 --> 48:02.166
CHANG: And to see that it
went back many, many years.

48:02.200 --> 48:04.666
GATES: It goes back to
your 34th great-grandfather.

48:04.700 --> 48:07.133
We estimate that Chang
Jeong-Pil is your

48:07.166 --> 48:09.366
34th great-grandfather.

48:09.400 --> 48:15.300
CHANG: It's just something my
dad never spoke about, ever.

48:16.166 --> 48:19.233
GATES: Isn't it cool that
these clan genealogies exist?

48:19.266 --> 48:21.666
CHANG: It's wild to me.

48:21.700 --> 48:26.200
I think about this a lot, it's
something I always grew up

48:26.233 --> 48:29.066
jealous of, I think, of, of my,

48:29.100 --> 48:31.666
my, my, my friends that
have European ancestry,

48:31.700 --> 48:33.642
and they can go way back,
way back, like, "oh, I..."

48:33.666 --> 48:34.706
GATES: And a coat of arms?

48:34.733 --> 48:35.500
CHANG: Yeah.

48:35.533 --> 48:36.600
GATES: Yeah.

48:36.633 --> 48:37.433
CHANG: And it's like, oh,
that's, I'll never know

48:37.466 --> 48:41.033
what that's like.
And here it is.

48:42.066 --> 48:44.866
GATES: We cannot verify the
accuracy of every rung of the

48:44.900 --> 48:47.966
tree in this jokbo, but
according to scholars,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.966
there is a widespread
consensus that David's clan

48:51.000 --> 48:55.800
affiliation ties him to a
very illustrious ancestor:

48:56.300 --> 49:01.400
a legendary mariner and
warrior named Jang Bogo.

49:01.433 --> 49:04.833
Jang Bogo became a national
hero following his death

49:04.866 --> 49:08.366
in the year 846...

49:08.400 --> 49:11.400
Giving David a new
appreciation for all the

49:11.433 --> 49:15.033
history that his
father left behind.

49:16.466 --> 49:18.176
CHANG: It's like, I almost
don't want to believe that

49:18.200 --> 49:23.200
this is true because...

49:24.133 --> 49:26.866
I just grew up thinking
there's no way this

49:26.900 --> 49:29.733
lineage can, like...

49:30.566 --> 49:34.033
GATES: Jang Bogo is still
celebrated in South Korea today.

49:34.066 --> 49:36.866
He has been featured in both a
South Korean television series

49:36.900 --> 49:40.766
and a film, and the South
Korean navy named a whole

49:40.800 --> 49:44.900
class of attack submarines
after this bad brother.

49:44.933 --> 49:46.400
CHANG: Wow.

49:46.433 --> 49:48.109
GATES: Does learning
about this make you think any

49:48.133 --> 49:50.566
differently about your father?

49:50.600 --> 49:52.600
CHANG: I guess it
adds to the complexity.

49:52.633 --> 49:53.766
GATES: Right.

49:53.800 --> 49:55.476
CHANG: I spent so much time
trying to think about him

49:55.500 --> 49:57.466
acclimating to America, I never,

49:57.500 --> 50:00.200
ever once really
thought about his life,

50:00.233 --> 50:02.700
pre, you know, immigrating.

50:02.733 --> 50:03.933
GATES: Uh-huh.

50:03.966 --> 50:05.700
CHANG: I mean, it's amazing.

50:05.733 --> 50:10.066
It puts a lot of things into
perspective that I thought I

50:10.100 --> 50:14.300
knew about, but now I really
didn't know anything about

50:14.333 --> 50:16.333
at all.

50:16.766 --> 50:18.342
GATES: The paper trail had
now run out for both

50:18.366 --> 50:20.600
David and Raul.

50:20.633 --> 50:22.266
CHANG: Wow.

50:22.300 --> 50:24.566
GATES: It was time to show
them their full family trees.

50:24.600 --> 50:25.833
CHANG: This is amazing.

50:25.866 --> 50:29.733
GATES: Mapping the deep roots
that had vanished in exile...

50:29.766 --> 50:31.500
ESPARZA: How extraordinary!

50:31.533 --> 50:33.433
GATES: These stories
will never be lost,

50:33.466 --> 50:35.066
these names will never be lost.

50:35.100 --> 50:38.366
CHANG: I've always
wanted this, always.

50:38.933 --> 50:42.733
GATES: Seeing their ancestry
traced back centuries,

50:42.766 --> 50:46.666
in places both
familiar and unexpected,

50:46.700 --> 50:50.733
compelled both men to rethink
their own identities...

50:50.766 --> 50:53.200
CHANG: You know, I grew up
with this notion that there's

50:53.233 --> 50:57.166
nothing special about
my family, you know?

50:57.200 --> 50:59.766
And I think a lot
of that is, again,

50:59.800 --> 51:04.400
having this immigrant mentality
of being marginalized,

51:04.433 --> 51:06.533
or what you think is special
is not really special.

51:06.566 --> 51:11.933
But, I mean, a lot
happened for me to be here.

51:11.966 --> 51:13.733
GATES: Right.

51:13.766 --> 51:17.866
CHANG: And I think
that changes my sort of

51:17.900 --> 51:21.400
understanding, uh, so I got to,

51:21.433 --> 51:23.133
I got to do some more
meditating on what

51:23.166 --> 51:24.900
that means to me.

51:24.933 --> 51:27.733
ESPARZA: Right now, I
feel slightly off-balance.

51:29.000 --> 51:34.100
I can confirm that
who I am is in my DNA,

51:34.133 --> 51:37.766
so to speak, and my interests
and how I feel and think.

51:37.800 --> 51:41.166
That feels very solid.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.700
GATES: Mm-hmm.

51:42.733 --> 51:45.800
ESPARZA: But what it also does
is make me feel like I don't

51:45.833 --> 51:48.200
know myself at all.

51:48.233 --> 51:53.066
There's more to find out,
more that I'm made up of.

51:54.233 --> 51:55.933
GATES: That's the end
of our journey with

51:55.966 --> 51:59.000
Raul Esparza and David Chang.

51:59.033 --> 52:02.800
Join me next time when we
unlock the secrets of the past

52:02.833 --> 52:04.366
for new guests,

52:04.400 --> 52:08.566
on another episode of
"Finding Your Roots".
