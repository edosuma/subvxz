[instrumental music]

00:06.792 --> 00:09.958
You know, I've been stuck
in this tin can for three years.

00:10.042 --> 00:13.583
I haven't taken a vacation.
Okay, okay, it's my fault.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.750
I had the leave coming,
I just didn't take it.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.833
I mean, the pay sucks,
I knew that when I signed on.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.333
And nobody said I'd survive
the job.

00:19.417 --> 00:20.750
Now, I give you all that.

00:20.833 --> 00:23.250
But where in my contract
does it say

00:23.333 --> 00:24.625
that I have to eat
the same food

00:24.708 --> 00:29.250
for breakfast every day
for three years?

00:29.333 --> 00:33.583
Paragraph 47, subsection 19,
clause 9A.

00:33.667 --> 00:37.042
You can find it in the index
under SUAEI.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.250
SUAEI?

00:39.333 --> 00:42.167
- Shut up and eat it.
- Shut up and eat it.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.583
Ex-excuse me, commander.

00:54.667 --> 00:57.000
- What? What-what-what?
- It's nothing.

00:59.042 --> 01:01.458
- I smell bacon and eggs.
- Get out of here.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.208
Do you know how much it costs
to bring eggs all the way

01:03.292 --> 01:04.667
out here before they spoil?

01:04.750 --> 01:06.958
I have tried for years,
it can't..

01:08.333 --> 01:11.375
[sniffing]
Bacon and eggs, definitely.

01:11.458 --> 01:13.625
[gasps]

01:13.708 --> 01:15.750
I-it's from Marcus.

01:15.833 --> 01:18.042
It's nothing like that.
I did him a favor.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.750
I helped get him an Identi-card
so that he could use

01:19.833 --> 01:21.917
some of the facilities
on the station.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.667
And he asked what he could do
for me in return

01:23.750 --> 01:25.667
and I said surprise me.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.167
I can get anchovies.
I can get olive oil.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.708
Anything that's prepackaged.

01:29.792 --> 01:32.500
I haven't seen a fresh chicken
egg in three years.

01:32.583 --> 01:33.875
I mean cooked or otherwise.

01:33.958 --> 01:36.333
And bacon? Forget it.

01:36.417 --> 01:40.250
[sighs]
Look, if you want it,
it's yours.

01:40.333 --> 01:44.042
Oh, no. Wouldn't dream of it.
Now, now, go on, eat.

01:44.125 --> 01:47.167
- Yeah, don't mind us.
- We'll just sit right here.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.583
Yeah, and watch.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.000
[sighs]
I'm gonna kill him.

01:52.458 --> 01:55.125
After breakfast,
if I can find him.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.417
[dramatic music]

02:01.625 --> 02:02.917
[groaning]

02:08.042 --> 02:10.125
[grunting]

02:22.208 --> 02:23.792
Get out of here! Go!

02:23.875 --> 02:26.333
[intense music]

02:30.750 --> 02:32.625
[screams]

02:35.958 --> 02:37.667
Bastards.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.708
[clattering]

02:51.375 --> 02:53.292
[yelling]

03:05.917 --> 03:10.667
(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was our
last best hope for peace.

03:13.958 --> 03:16.375
It failed.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.750
[theme music]

03:30.708 --> 03:32.625
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:32.708 --> 03:34.958
it became something greater.

03:35.042 --> 03:38.167
Our last, best hope
for victory.

03:43.125 --> 03:45.375
The year is 2260.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.292
The place...Babylon 5.

03:51.042 --> 03:53.833

(woman over TV)
As Senate hearings
into the death of

04:35.917 --> 04:38.167
President Louis Santiago
enter their sixth week

04:38.250 --> 04:39.667
evidence purporting to be

04:39.750 --> 04:42.625
'from President Clark's
physician has surfaced.'

04:42.708 --> 04:44.500
'These records seem to indicate'

04:44.583 --> 04:46.500
'that the illness
which prevented President Clark'

04:46.583 --> 04:49.375
'from being aboard
Earthforce One when it exploded'

04:49.458 --> 04:52.125
'may have only been
a convenient alibi.'

04:52.208 --> 04:53.875
Representatives
for President Clark

04:53.958 --> 04:56.500
'speaking before the Senate
Investigative Committee today'

04:56.583 --> 04:58.375
'dismissed
these latest allegations'

04:58.458 --> 05:00.958
'describing them
as attempts to destabilize'

05:01.042 --> 05:04.000
'Earthgov from within
and without.'

05:04.083 --> 05:06.917
'In related news, Earth Dome
Chief of Staff Bill Harris'

05:07.000 --> 05:10.542
announced that a new alien race,
only recently detected

05:10.625 --> 05:13.625
may pose a significant threat
to planetary security.

05:13.708 --> 05:16.667
'When asked what was being done
to counter this threat'

05:16.750 --> 05:21.000
'Harris said only that extreme
measures may be required.'

05:21.083 --> 05:22.792
[beeps]

05:24.208 --> 05:26.750
[intense music]

05:31.375 --> 05:33.417
Will she be alright?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.750
Well, there's no internal damage
or a concussion.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.292
Well, there's something
to be thankful for.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.458
So, who were the men
attacking her?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.292
Businessmen, of a sort.

05:44.375 --> 05:47.458
They know the right doors to
knock on, the right words to say

05:47.542 --> 05:51.583
to get a list of names of people
that other people want found

05:51.667 --> 05:54.917
captured or killed
for the right price.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.917
Why her? What did she do?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.750
Nothing...yet.

06:03.250 --> 06:06.500
Keep a close eye on her, doctor.
I'll be back.

06:10.833 --> 06:13.417
[instrumental music]

06:21.208 --> 06:23.333
Take five. I'll be okay.

06:26.167 --> 06:29.000
Thought I'd stop in
and see how you're doing.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.375
Fine, fine.

06:31.458 --> 06:34.667
Two weeks down, six to go
before I've repaid my debt

06:34.750 --> 06:37.958
to society
for attacking Mollari.

06:38.042 --> 06:40.083
I've taken
the opportunity provided

06:40.167 --> 06:45.458
by my incarceration
to meditate...to think.

06:45.542 --> 06:49.625
- Sometimes I even sing.
- I know, we got a petition.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.250
For or against?

06:51.333 --> 06:53.917
Based on the sound, they think
we're torturing you in here.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.958
[laughs]

06:56.042 --> 06:58.667
Sit down, Mr. Garibaldi.

06:58.750 --> 07:03.833
You know, a true artist is never
appreciated in his own time.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.500
Or his own cellblock?

07:06.583 --> 07:10.500
And you? Are you enjoying
the book of G'Quan?

07:10.583 --> 07:12.000
Well, what I can follow, yeah.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.375
I just wish there were a
translated version I could read.

07:14.458 --> 07:17.875
[gasps]
Sacrilege, it must be read
in the mother tongue

07:17.958 --> 07:20.167
or not at all.

07:20.250 --> 07:23.042
You know what's odd?
You seem, I don't know, happier

07:23.125 --> 07:25.125
in here than you were out there.

07:26.792 --> 07:31.167
In here, Mr. Garibaldi,
you cannot hide from yourself.

07:32.458 --> 07:36.375
'Everything out there has only
one purpose..'

07:36.458 --> 07:39.958
...to distract us
from ourselves..

07:40.042 --> 07:42.167
From what is truly important..

07:44.000 --> 07:46.208
But there are no distractions
in here.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.458
You can learn much from silence.

07:50.542 --> 07:52.375
And what have you learned?

07:52.458 --> 07:55.833
I'm writing it all down,
right here.

07:55.917 --> 08:02.333
The war, the fall of Narn,
...our mistakes..

08:02.417 --> 08:05.958
And what must be done
to correct them.

08:06.042 --> 08:09.875
I expect to have it finished
by the time I'm released.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.542
Can I see it?

08:13.417 --> 08:14.750
When it is done.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.208
[transmitter beeps]

08:16.292 --> 08:17.542
- Yeah.
- 'Chief.'

08:17.625 --> 08:19.667
(female #1)
'We need you ASAP. Code 7-R.'

08:19.750 --> 08:21.667
'Our new friend says
to tell you, the package'

08:21.750 --> 08:23.375
'you've been waiting for
has arrived.'

08:23.458 --> 08:26.083
Alright, on my way.
I'll check in with you later.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.333
Remember that petition.

08:31.708 --> 08:34.375
[instrumental music]

08:47.875 --> 08:51.417
(Michael)
'Seven years ago,
I saw something.'

08:51.500 --> 08:53.500
'I was never able to prove it.'

08:53.583 --> 08:55.083
'And after enough people
said I was nuts'

08:55.167 --> 08:56.250
'I figured I'd shut up
until I could find'

08:56.333 --> 08:58.917
'somebody to back up my story.'

08:59.000 --> 09:00.083
'Well, I found her.'

09:00.167 --> 09:01.875
'Her name is Dr. Mary Kirkish.'

09:01.958 --> 09:03.458
'Through the Rangers,
I heard she was on the run.'

09:03.542 --> 09:05.833
'So, I asked Marcus
to find her.'

09:09.958 --> 09:11.292
'She risked her life
coming here.'

09:11.375 --> 09:13.500
'A lot of people want her dead.'

09:16.542 --> 09:19.625
'Once she gets here,
once you talk to her'

09:19.708 --> 09:21.875
'you'll understand why.'

09:23.250 --> 09:25.792
[dramatic music]

10:01.750 --> 10:04.000
For the past 12 years,
I've been working

10:04.083 --> 10:06.333
for Interplanetary Expeditions.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.500
We conduct archaeological digs
on other worlds

10:08.583 --> 10:10.750
in search of new technology.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.250
Well, new to us, anyway.

10:12.333 --> 10:15.333
"Exploring the past
to create a better future."

10:15.417 --> 10:17.417
We've seen the ads.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.000
Seven years ago,
I was stationed on Mars.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.500
We were always getting
false leads on artifacts

10:23.583 --> 10:25.500
supposedly buried beneath
the Martian soil

10:25.583 --> 10:27.042
for thousands of years.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.958
Nothing ever came of it.

10:29.042 --> 10:30.708
And then, one day,
our sonic probes

10:30.792 --> 10:32.000
picked up something 300 feet

10:32.083 --> 10:34.875
beneath the surface
of Syria Planum.

10:34.958 --> 10:36.917
We didn't know what it was..

10:37.000 --> 10:40.333
...except it wasn't
a natural formation.

10:40.417 --> 10:42.542
And given its depth,
it had to have been there

10:42.625 --> 10:44.708
at least a 1000 years.

10:47.417 --> 10:48.958
It was the middle
of the Martian winter

10:49.042 --> 10:51.208
so it took weeks
just to dig half of it

10:51.292 --> 10:53.250
out of the ground.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.750
But that much was enough
to give me

10:54.833 --> 10:57.708
nightmares
for the rest of my life.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.333
[intense music]

11:07.042 --> 11:10.917
It's the same ship we've been
seeing on the news lately.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.792
'The one that looks like
it came straight from hell.'

11:16.167 --> 11:18.167
But back home, they're saying

11:18.250 --> 11:20.083
they've never seen ships
like this before.

11:20.167 --> 11:23.125
They're lying.
I was there.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.833
Then why this campaign
to find out more about them?

11:25.917 --> 11:27.750
They may be using this threat
as an excuse

11:27.833 --> 11:30.500
to tighten security,
restrict information.

11:30.583 --> 11:33.333
If this is true, they haven't
been trying to find out

11:33.417 --> 11:34.917
what these ships are.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.125
They're trying to find out
who else knows about them.

11:38.208 --> 11:41.875
That's an awfully big conclusion
based on finding just one ship.

11:43.167 --> 11:44.833
There was just one ship,
wasn't there?

11:51.750 --> 11:54.625
That was just the start.

11:54.708 --> 11:56.708
It gets worse.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.292
'Only a handful of people know
what happened after that'

11:59.375 --> 12:01.292
including me.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.250
All the others are either dead
or missing.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.792
Once I leave here,
sooner or later, they'll find me

12:07.875 --> 12:09.292
and I'll disappear.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.708
Before that happens,
someone has to know.

12:12.792 --> 12:15.250
Someone has to stop them
before it's too late.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.375
We told Earth Central
what we'd found.

12:21.458 --> 12:25.125
It was a strike of a lifetime.
We were all very excited.

12:25.208 --> 12:28.500
But there was something about it
that made us nervous.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.250
And then one of our worker,
who was clearing away the dirt

12:32.333 --> 12:34.083
accidentally touched it
with his bare hand.

12:34.167 --> 12:35.917
He died instantly,
as if the life

12:36.000 --> 12:38.542
had just been sucked
right out of him.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.542
Did you ever get a reply
from Earth Central?

12:41.625 --> 12:44.208
(Dr. Mary)
'No, not at first.'

12:44.292 --> 12:45.708
'But a week later,
we were suddenly'

12:45.792 --> 12:48.000
'ordered to stop digging
and pull back'

12:48.083 --> 12:50.167
'to our secondary base
two miles away.'

12:51.667 --> 12:54.667
Well, we didn't want to go,
but we were told anyone

12:54.750 --> 12:58.917
who didn't move would be fired.
So, we moved.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.583
For six days,
we just sat there waiting

13:03.667 --> 13:05.500
while unmarked shuttles
moved in and out of the area

13:05.583 --> 13:07.042
surrounding the dig.

13:08.375 --> 13:11.167
And then suddenly
everything stopped.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.042
No shuttles,
no communication, nothing.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.833
[shuttles whirring]

13:18.833 --> 13:20.750
That's when I saw it.

13:22.417 --> 13:25.167
[intense music]

13:34.000 --> 13:36.292
I just wanted
to run away and hide.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.292
Jump in a hole and pull
the ground in over me

13:38.375 --> 13:40.875
'but there was nowhere to go.'

13:40.958 --> 13:42.750
Nothing to do but watch.

13:44.417 --> 13:47.750
At first, I thought it was
destroying the other ship.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.375
Then I realized
it was digging it out.

14:01.583 --> 14:07.625
For 20, 25 minutes,
nothing happened.

14:07.708 --> 14:09.333
Then we heard it.

14:09.417 --> 14:12.458
[screeching]

14:15.167 --> 14:17.333
A sound that just reaches
right into your brain

14:17.417 --> 14:19.292
and rips it apart.

14:24.958 --> 14:28.000
The sound of something terrible
being born.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.917
They warned us
that if we told anyone

14:30.000 --> 14:34.917
'what we'd seen, there would
be unfortunate consequences.'

14:35.000 --> 14:38.708
'Then they broke us up,
assigned us to other worlds'

14:38.792 --> 14:41.292
'so we'd never have a chance
to talk to each other.'

14:43.375 --> 14:45.375
What's your involvement
in all this?

14:45.458 --> 14:48.542
I was piloting a shuttle on Mars
around the same time.

14:48.625 --> 14:51.542
We went down, two of us
had to get back to civilization

14:51.625 --> 14:53.792
on our own.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.792
I saw a part of what
she just described.

14:56.875 --> 15:00.000
When I went back to check it
out, it was all gone.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.833
Uh, except for..

15:03.583 --> 15:05.167
Except for this.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.917
Psi Corps.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.750
A few weeks ago,
I was called into a new dig.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.125
They found another one
of these things.

15:15.208 --> 15:18.625
This time on Ganymede.
But there's a difference.

15:20.083 --> 15:24.333
Whoever's behind this back home
doesn't want to give it back.

15:24.417 --> 15:27.083
In three days, they're going to
take it back to Earth

15:27.167 --> 15:29.042
study its secrets
and learn how to use it

15:29.125 --> 15:30.875
against the other races
and if necessary

15:30.958 --> 15:32.208
against our own people.

15:32.292 --> 15:33.875
'That's why I had to warn
someone.'

15:33.958 --> 15:36.500
You can't let them get a hold
of one of these ships.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.333
They don't want it
so we can fight these things.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.625
They want us to become
more like them.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.542
That's it.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.250
That's all I have to say.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.083
They can kill me now.
I don't care.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.708
That will not happen.

15:51.792 --> 15:54.917
We've made arrangements
to get you into Minbari space.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.208
Lennier, please take care
of Dr. Kirkish.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.708
Of course.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.792
If Earth and Psi Corps
really are working

16:13.875 --> 16:16.458
with the Shadows,
this is too big.

16:17.917 --> 16:20.083
Ho-how can we fight
something like that?

16:21.542 --> 16:26.083
I need to think about this
for a while...alone.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.583
'I'll call you
when I have something to say.'

16:31.208 --> 16:32.958
Delenn, stay.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.625
I'm gonna need you for this.

16:42.042 --> 16:45.083
Zack?
Where's the chief?

16:45.167 --> 16:47.208
He's been in some meeting
with the captain all afternoon.

16:47.292 --> 16:48.708
Something you want me
to tell him?

16:48.792 --> 16:51.375
No, no, no.
I was just checking.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.375
There's a Nightwatch meeting
tomorrow morning, Zack.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.083
And I just wanted to make sure
you knew about it.

16:55.167 --> 16:58.083
Another one?
Come on, that's three this week.

16:58.167 --> 17:00.875
Eternal vigilance is the price
of freedom, Zack.

17:02.208 --> 17:06.250
Big things are coming. We've got
to be ready for them.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.417
See you tomorrow.

17:11.417 --> 17:14.250
You know, sometimes watching
them like this

17:14.333 --> 17:17.250
without them even knowing
we're here..

17:17.333 --> 17:20.208
...makes you feel a little
like God, doesn't it?

17:22.458 --> 17:25.042
[mellow music]

17:52.250 --> 17:55.250
It's done.
I've sent Lennier ahead.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.167
He'll make all the arrangements.

17:58.542 --> 18:00.875
Are you sure you wish
to go through with this?

18:09.458 --> 18:11.750
Then it's time
to tell the others.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.750
[instrumental music]

18:20.833 --> 18:24.958
Everyone in this room knows
what Earth is turning into.

18:25.042 --> 18:29.083
We can't allow President Clark
to get ahold of a Shadow ship.

18:29.167 --> 18:32.333
That kind of power in his hands
could be the end of everything

18:32.417 --> 18:34.500
that we have worked for.

18:34.583 --> 18:38.667
We have got to stop that ship
before it leaves Ganymede.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.625
Swell. I love it. How?

18:43.792 --> 18:45.583
Delenn and I will take
the White Star

18:45.667 --> 18:48.375
into Earth-controlled space.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.708
With luck, we'll find the ship,
destroy it on the ground

18:51.792 --> 18:53.042
before they can activate it.

18:53.125 --> 18:55.000
- If not--
- 'Captain, you can't do this.'

18:55.083 --> 18:56.875
As soon as you open
up a jump point near Jupiter

18:56.958 --> 18:58.750
you'll be picked up
by the early warning system.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.083
I know.

19:00.167 --> 19:02.167
Our own ships will be sent in
to destroy you.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.667
You'll be completely outgunned.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.042
We understand, commander.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.542
Neither of us has any illusions

19:06.625 --> 19:07.750
about what
we are planning to do.

19:07.833 --> 19:10.167
You can't take on Earth.
I mean, not now.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.000
- Later..
- Later is too late.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.833
We've already notified
the White Star.

19:14.917 --> 19:18.000
It's on stand by,
awaiting our arrival.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.417
So, what're you gonna do
when they open fire?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.708
You're gonna fire back
on one of our own ships?

19:21.792 --> 19:24.792
- What if you're captured?
- We won't be captured.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.250
One way or another.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.750
The decision's mine
and mine alone.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.750
And..

19:33.833 --> 19:35.583
...it's made.

19:37.167 --> 19:38.333
(John)
The rest of you
will be needed here

19:38.417 --> 19:40.000
to cover my absence.

19:40.083 --> 19:41.958
It's a two day jump
to Earth space.

19:42.042 --> 19:44.583
That's a long time to be gone.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.500
I'm leaving behind
my Identi-card

19:46.583 --> 19:48.500
my uniform, command rank..

19:48.583 --> 19:50.000
Anything that could
lead back here

19:50.083 --> 19:53.083
if something should go wrong.

19:53.167 --> 19:55.208
Susan, in our absence,
I'm leaving you

19:55.292 --> 19:58.250
and Garibaldi in charge
of the Rangers.

19:58.333 --> 20:00.250
I'd tell you to take good care
of the station

20:00.333 --> 20:03.042
but I know
that's not necessary.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.542
I've left instructions
in my desk

20:06.625 --> 20:09.250
for a cover story
if we don't come back.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.708
You'll send out my Starfury

20:10.792 --> 20:12.708
and use the auto-destruct
sequence.

20:12.792 --> 20:15.375
Doctor, you'll provide
the organic mass

20:15.458 --> 20:17.333
to simulate a casualty.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.792
[dramatic music]

20:27.667 --> 20:29.708
I wish none of this
were necessary.

20:31.083 --> 20:32.750
But we all knew
that sooner or later

20:32.833 --> 20:34.708
we'd have to deal with Earth.

20:36.208 --> 20:39.583
So I guess it's time
we got down to business.

20:42.750 --> 20:46.750
If there's any way
we can come back, we will.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.708
[dramatic music]

21:21.125 --> 21:23.708
[music continues]

21:41.708 --> 21:43.833
As liaison to the Nightwatch
office back home

21:43.917 --> 21:46.875
I've received several
disturbing communique

21:46.958 --> 21:48.708
over the last few days.

21:48.792 --> 21:52.625
The good news is,
our efforts to find corruption

21:52.708 --> 21:56.542
and disloyalty here
and back home have succeeded

21:56.625 --> 21:58.792
beyond our expectations.

21:58.875 --> 22:01.375
So, what's the bad news?

22:01.458 --> 22:04.750
Their findings
confirm our worst fears.

22:04.833 --> 22:07.625
Earth has been sold out
by our own people.

22:07.708 --> 22:10.833
Senators, high ranking military
officers, news media

22:10.917 --> 22:14.042
correspondents, even some
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.708
(all)
What?

22:15.792 --> 22:18.083
Everything we've been seeing
lately, the libelous attacks

22:18.167 --> 22:20.083
on the president,
alien forces encroaching

22:20.167 --> 22:24.042
on our territory, the lies and
subversion going on back home.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.292
They're all part
of an organized effort

22:26.375 --> 22:30.125
to weaken our government from
within as a prelude to invasion.

22:30.208 --> 22:32.750
I don't believe this.

22:32.833 --> 22:36.167
They'll start making arrests
within the next two months.

22:36.250 --> 22:38.333
The lists have already
been drawn up.

22:38.417 --> 22:40.750
What can we do to help?

22:40.833 --> 22:43.500
Earth needs all the information
we can give her.

22:43.583 --> 22:45.333
Any source is acceptable.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.083
To make it easier for sources
to come forward

22:47.167 --> 22:50.083
we're going to allow them to
give us information anonymously.

22:50.167 --> 22:52.833
We're authorized to look into
past history

22:52.917 --> 22:55.958
social contacts,
party affiliations

22:56.042 --> 22:57.958
to conduct e-mail
and vid surveillance

22:58.042 --> 23:00.125
'of Babcom and Stellarcom
transmissions.'

23:00.208 --> 23:04.792
Whoa-whoa, wait, just how far
does this go anyway?

23:04.875 --> 23:07.917
Do we start suspecting
everybody?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.667
No, of course not.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.875
Anyone in the Nightwatch
is automatically recognized

23:12.958 --> 23:16.083
as working
in the best interests of Earth.

23:16.167 --> 23:20.875
As for the other officers,
well, we won't look at them

23:20.958 --> 23:24.917
unless we detect any unusual
activity on their part.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.750
In that case,
may I ask a question?

23:27.833 --> 23:30.208
Does anyone in this room
know where the captain is?

23:30.292 --> 23:33.208
[intense music]

23:33.292 --> 23:35.417
[indistinct whisperings]

23:44.500 --> 23:46.125
(Lennier)
'Captain?'

23:47.792 --> 23:49.333
Captain?

23:51.458 --> 23:54.167
Mr. Lennier.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.792
What's our position?

23:55.875 --> 23:58.875
Thirty-two standard hours
from our destination.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.417
You have been up
almost 20 hours.

24:01.500 --> 24:05.542
- I recommend sleep.
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.417
If we should encounter
resistance

24:07.500 --> 24:09.708
at the end of our journey,
would it not be wise

24:09.792 --> 24:12.333
to confront it rested
and clear of mind?

24:55.125 --> 24:57.000
[sighs]

24:59.958 --> 25:01.542
[chuckles]

25:06.917 --> 25:08.167
[grunts]

25:09.500 --> 25:11.167
Oh.

25:16.042 --> 25:18.458
I wondered when you would get
some sleep.

25:20.792 --> 25:23.417
Yeah, you have
a most persistent attache.

25:24.958 --> 25:26.583
How can you sleep
in these things?

25:26.667 --> 25:29.250
It's quite simple,
with proper meditation.

25:29.333 --> 25:31.375
We consider sleeping
in the horizontal

25:31.458 --> 25:32.958
to be tempting death.

25:33.042 --> 25:37.542
Yeah, well, if I sleep on this,
I'll be tempting fate all night.

25:37.625 --> 25:39.208
Don't worry.

25:39.292 --> 25:42.000
I will watch and catch you
if you should fall.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.625
Okay.

25:45.708 --> 25:48.292
I doubt if I'll be getting
any sleep anyway.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.458
It's funny.

25:54.542 --> 25:58.667
This will be the closest I've
been to Earth in four years.

26:00.042 --> 26:02.667
Who would have thought
I'd come back in a Minbari ship?

26:04.042 --> 26:06.208
You know what I miss most
about home?

26:09.042 --> 26:13.625
The sound of rain hitting
the roof at night.

26:15.042 --> 26:18.500
It always helped me fall asleep.

26:18.583 --> 26:22.708
Back when I was a kid
preparing for the academy..

26:22.792 --> 26:27.792
...I'd be up till 4 or 5 o'clock
in the morning studying.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.750
I'd have maybe..

26:29.833 --> 26:36.333
...two hours to sleep after that
but...I was so wound up.

26:36.417 --> 26:38.750
I'd just lie there.

26:38.833 --> 26:41.792
Same thing happened the night
before my final test.

26:43.417 --> 26:48.500
I just knew if I didn't get some
sleep, I'd...never pass it.

26:49.875 --> 26:53.000
And...did it begin to rain?

26:53.083 --> 26:54.458
No.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.958
But dad..

27:01.750 --> 27:06.333
My dad...heard me
walking around.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.042
He knew I couldn't sleep.

27:08.125 --> 27:12.375
So, he went outside,
he got the garden hose

27:12.458 --> 27:15.292
and sprayed it,
so it came down on the roof..

27:17.958 --> 27:20.250
'...just like rain.'

27:20.333 --> 27:23.583
He stood there making it rain
until I fell asleep.

27:25.208 --> 27:28.083
I sometimes think he would have
stood there...for days

27:28.167 --> 27:30.167
if he had to.

27:36.167 --> 27:37.917
I miss him.

27:44.125 --> 27:46.208
And right now..

27:47.833 --> 27:50.917
...more than anything else in
the world, I wish it would rain.

27:54.167 --> 27:56.583
Just for a little while.

27:59.125 --> 28:02.208
[speaks in foreign language]

28:06.250 --> 28:09.292
[rain pattering]

28:16.167 --> 28:17.958
Sleep now.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.958
[instrumental music]

28:23.875 --> 28:26.458
[thunder rumbling]

28:32.667 --> 28:34.500
(Marcus)
'And according to one
of our units on the border'

28:34.583 --> 28:36.958
of Centauri space,
they've continued

28:37.042 --> 28:39.792
massing their fleet.
We don't know why.

28:39.875 --> 28:41.375
Maybe they expect
a counterattack.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.000
It's hard to say.

28:44.375 --> 28:47.083
And they have much
to be concerned about.

28:47.167 --> 28:50.792
There's always the threat of an
attack by, say, a giant space

28:50.875 --> 28:53.875
'dragon, the kind that eats
the sun once every 30 days.'

28:53.958 --> 28:57.583
It's a nuisance, but what can
you expect from reptiles?

28:57.667 --> 29:01.125
Did I mention that my nose
is on fire, that I have 15 wild

29:01.208 --> 29:04.125
badgers living in my trousers?

29:04.208 --> 29:06.125
I'm sorry,
would you prefer ferrets?

29:06.208 --> 29:08.792
What I'd prefer is for you to..

29:08.875 --> 29:11.042
To what?

29:11.125 --> 29:12.667
I don't know.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.125
I don't know
how to relate to you

29:14.208 --> 29:15.917
how you fit into anything here.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.958
I mean, where are you
in the ranks? Above, below?

29:19.042 --> 29:21.500
Left, right,
in a box by the door?

29:21.583 --> 29:23.083
It doesn't matter.

29:23.167 --> 29:24.792
And that's not really
the problem, is it?

29:24.875 --> 29:26.167
If anything happens
to the captain, I'm holding

29:26.250 --> 29:27.583
you personally responsible.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.833
Because I sent him off
on a suicide mission.

29:29.917 --> 29:32.000
Ever since you've come here,
we've had nothing but trouble.

29:32.083 --> 29:34.625
- You're a loose canon.
- He went of his own free will.

29:34.708 --> 29:36.333
- He didn't have to go.
- Yes, he did.

29:36.417 --> 29:38.583
And you knew he would the second
he found out what was going on.

29:38.667 --> 29:42.125
I'd rather assumed
he would send me.

29:42.208 --> 29:44.500
Funny, that.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.917
But, if you are right, and
it was inevitable, why blame me?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.167
Because we shouldn't have
to be doing this.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.667
Because he didn't have
any business taking out

29:51.750 --> 29:53.625
that ship without me
there to help him.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.125
Because we're going up
against our own government

29:55.208 --> 29:56.417
and I don't know
where the hell I fit in anymore

29:56.500 --> 29:58.958
much less of you,
and damn it..

29:59.042 --> 30:01.417
...because I don't have
anybody else to blame!

30:04.833 --> 30:06.375
It's time.

30:07.750 --> 30:09.917
They should almost
be there by now.

30:17.125 --> 30:18.583
Alright, everyone.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.542
We've just set off every
long-range scanner

30:20.625 --> 30:22.833
in the area, so we don't have
a lot of time, we have to--

30:22.917 --> 30:25.917
Captain, I-I'm picking
up a signal on the frequency

30:26.000 --> 30:28.333
provided by Dr. Kirkish.

30:28.417 --> 30:29.833
It's very faint.

30:29.917 --> 30:32.417
I can only get audio.
It's from Ganymede.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.125
Put it through.

30:35.833 --> 30:38.625
[man over radio]
'IXP One to Base.
IXP One to Base.'

30:38.708 --> 30:40.458
'Ready to begin transference.'

30:40.542 --> 30:42.250
'Subject is approaching target.'

30:42.333 --> 30:44.833
'Repeat,
subject is approaching target.'

30:44.917 --> 30:46.375
What's he talking about?

30:46.458 --> 30:49.417
The Shadow vessels use living
creatures as their central core.

30:49.500 --> 30:52.583
Whoever steps inside merges with
it, becomes one with the ship.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.583
After that,
it's fully functional.

30:54.667 --> 30:56.750
They must be sending someone
inside right now.

30:56.833 --> 30:58.875
Faster, Lennier,
we need to get there.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.333
[dramatic music]

31:02.417 --> 31:06.417
John, if whoever's going inside
hasn't been properly prepared

31:06.500 --> 31:09.083
the results could be disastrous.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.333
[man over radio]
'He's moving into the bridge.'

31:11.417 --> 31:14.417
'He's disappeared
inside the ship.'

31:14.500 --> 31:17.750
'So-something's happening.
We-we've lost bio-scan.'

31:17.833 --> 31:20.042
'Something's..
Oh, my God!'

31:20.125 --> 31:22.250
'It's moving. It's moving!'

31:22.333 --> 31:23.958
[screeching]

31:25.542 --> 31:28.125
- We've got visual.
- Put it through.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.875
[intense music]

31:39.917 --> 31:42.292
[zapping]

31:45.208 --> 31:49.125
In Valen's name, it's awake.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.792
[zapping]

31:58.875 --> 32:01.458
[dramatic music]

32:05.958 --> 32:07.417
This is what I was afraid of.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.250
The merging was not handled
properly.

32:09.333 --> 32:11.167
The ship is out of control,
insane.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.000
It will destroy anything
in its path.

32:13.083 --> 32:14.958
Then we've got to stop it
before anyone gets here.

32:15.042 --> 32:18.542
Engines at maximum. Stand by,
weapons system. Prepare to fire.

32:21.917 --> 32:24.000
John, if it's confused,
disoriented

32:24.083 --> 32:25.917
we may have a chance.
It's a small one--

32:26.000 --> 32:27.500
It's still a lot more
than an Earth cruiser

32:27.583 --> 32:29.000
will have against that thing.

32:29.083 --> 32:30.208
Fire!

32:30.292 --> 32:32.833
[zapping]

32:35.292 --> 32:37.833
[dramatic music]

32:45.292 --> 32:48.042
- Damage to their ship?
- Negligible.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.833
Full power to forward batteries.
One focused burst.

32:52.667 --> 32:53.875
Fire!

32:56.083 --> 32:57.875
(Lennier)
Minimal effect.

32:57.958 --> 33:00.042
Captain, its weapons
are at full strength.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.583
If it hits us dead on,
we cannot survive the blast.

33:02.667 --> 33:05.792
That's alright, that is alright,
I did what I needed to do.

33:05.875 --> 33:07.542
I got him mad enough
to follow us.

33:07.625 --> 33:09.917
'Redirect power to engines.
Come about.'

33:10.000 --> 33:11.833
(Lennier)
'Course?'

33:11.917 --> 33:14.250
(John)
Jupiter.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.875
Yeah, we're going inside.

33:15.958 --> 33:19.167
If we can't out-fight it,
let's hope we can out-think it.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.333
[dramatic music]

33:26.667 --> 33:28.333
How much pressure
can this thing take?

33:28.417 --> 33:29.917
Unknown.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
- There was no time to test it.
- What did you have in mind?

33:33.083 --> 33:34.750
(John)
'That ship isn't
fully functional yet.'

33:34.833 --> 33:37.000
Once inside the atmosphere
of Jupiter, it may not be able

33:37.083 --> 33:38.417
to climb out of
the gravity well.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.875
It's possible we may not be able
to escape either.

33:42.958 --> 33:44.375
I don't think
we have much choice.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.583
External pressures increasing..

33:51.667 --> 33:53.958
Approaching
two standard gravities.

33:55.833 --> 33:58.708
[music continues]

33:58.792 --> 34:00.750
[crackling]

34:01.917 --> 34:05.792
- What was that? A new weapon?
- No.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.792
No, when they fired,
the energy must have ignited

34:07.875 --> 34:09.167
the local hydrogen.

34:09.250 --> 34:10.625
Gravity's increasing.

34:10.708 --> 34:14.167
Temperature at 10,000 standard
units. 12,000!

34:14.250 --> 34:15.583
Continue descent.

34:18.500 --> 34:20.542
Temperature's beyond
safe limits.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.458
Pressure at this depth
is causing damage

34:22.542 --> 34:23.583
to the outer hull.

34:23.667 --> 34:25.333
Just a little longer.

34:25.417 --> 34:27.917
Captain, if we go any further,
we may not have enough power

34:28.000 --> 34:29.333
to escape
before we're destroyed.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.917
If we turn back too soon

34:31.000 --> 34:33.125
and that thing follows us out,
we'll be dead either way!

34:33.208 --> 34:34.542
Now, stand by!

34:36.208 --> 34:40.167
Hull's buckling.
Losing control.

34:40.250 --> 34:41.875
Now! Get us out of here!

34:44.042 --> 34:46.625
[dramatic music]

34:48.750 --> 34:50.833
Full power.
Give me everything you've got!

34:50.917 --> 34:53.292
If I were holding anything back,
I would tell you.

35:02.917 --> 35:05.250
[screeching]

35:17.833 --> 35:19.250
[chuckles]

35:20.583 --> 35:21.958
Any sign of the enemy?

35:22.042 --> 35:24.625
Scanners indicate
it's been destroyed.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.667
[exhales]

35:26.750 --> 35:28.042
Good.

35:28.125 --> 35:30.542
Then get us out of here
so we don't have to..

35:31.792 --> 35:33.750
I thought you said we killed
that thing.

35:33.833 --> 35:35.375
We did.

35:35.458 --> 35:36.833
(man over radio)
'This is the Earth Alliance
destroyer'

35:36.917 --> 35:39.750
'Agamemnon to
unidentified vessel.'

35:39.833 --> 35:41.292
Oh, hell.

35:41.375 --> 35:43.625
'We've recorded an attack
in this sector.'

35:43.708 --> 35:46.667
'You will surrender your vessel
and prepare to be boarded.'

35:48.375 --> 35:50.917
Of all the ships, why does it
have to be the Agamemnon?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.500
They must think
we are responsible

35:52.583 --> 35:53.792
for the attack on Ganymede.

35:53.875 --> 35:56.917
Of course.
It's the way our luck runs.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.542
[dramatic music]

36:02.583 --> 36:05.333
(Lennier)
Captain, shall I return fire?

36:07.625 --> 36:10.667
Captain...shall I return fire?

36:12.417 --> 36:14.542
Negative. I won't fire on her.

36:14.625 --> 36:16.750
Are they equipped for
atmospheric maneuvering?

36:16.833 --> 36:19.958
No. But they can track us down
like a bloodhound.

36:20.042 --> 36:22.292
They can wait us out,
they can knock us down

36:22.375 --> 36:24.708
or-or board us
if we try to escape.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.333
[crackling]

36:29.958 --> 36:31.417
They're getting closer.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.917
John, I know this is not
what you wanted.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.542
But if we remain here,
we will be destroyed.

36:36.625 --> 36:39.583
Our only choices are to fight
or to surrender.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.750
No, we can't surrender.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.875
And I won't open fire
on my old ship!

36:43.958 --> 36:46.083
Then what do you recommend?

36:47.750 --> 36:50.292
[intense music]

36:54.583 --> 36:57.458
Lennier, activate jump engines.

36:57.542 --> 36:59.875
- Inside the atmosphere?
- Yes.

36:59.958 --> 37:02.125
What? With all due respect

37:02.208 --> 37:04.625
for your innovative choice
of strategy

37:04.708 --> 37:06.667
'may I suggest
that the energy involved'

37:06.750 --> 37:10.167
in opening a jump point
in a hydrogen rich atmosphere

37:10.250 --> 37:12.750
would be explosive at best.

37:12.833 --> 37:14.333
No, she's right.

37:14.417 --> 37:17.208
We'll get as close as we can
to the edge of the atmosphere.

37:17.292 --> 37:19.792
That should minimize
the eruption, I-I hope.

37:21.292 --> 37:23.458
Send them a message in Interlac,
tell them that we are prepared

37:23.542 --> 37:25.792
to surrender but we need them
to back off a little.

37:25.875 --> 37:28.083
Then, bring her up slowly.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.083
Let me see it.

37:38.917 --> 37:40.208
Wait.

37:40.292 --> 37:41.667
(man over radio)
'Unidentified ship'

37:41.750 --> 37:43.042
'this is your final warning.'

37:43.125 --> 37:45.042
'Surrender your vessel,
or be destroyed.'

37:45.125 --> 37:46.417
Now!

37:46.500 --> 37:49.042
[dramatic music]

37:58.667 --> 38:02.292
[laughs]
Son of a gun.

38:02.375 --> 38:03.792
Oh..

38:04.875 --> 38:08.375
Ladies and gentle.. Minbari..

38:08.458 --> 38:10.125
Congratulations.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.875
We have just made the first
atmospheric jump

38:12.958 --> 38:15.417
that I have ever heard of.

38:15.500 --> 38:20.125
Mr. Lennier, put us on a course
for home. Best speed.

38:20.208 --> 38:24.208
I want to be long gone from here
by the time they jump after us.

38:24.292 --> 38:27.208
We'll be back this way again.

38:27.292 --> 38:29.292
And one way or another..

38:29.375 --> 38:31.167
...we will finish this.

38:32.792 --> 38:35.333
[instrumental music]

38:41.417 --> 38:44.083
[instrumental music]

38:44.167 --> 38:46.708
[woman over TV]
'And ISN has confirmed
earlier reports'

38:46.792 --> 38:48.917
'that an unidentified
alien ship'

38:49.000 --> 38:51.167
'attacked a research lab
on Ganymede.'

38:51.250 --> 38:54.042
'According to Earthforce,
the ship was pursued to Jupiter'

38:54.125 --> 38:56.833
and destroyed
by the EAS Agamemnon.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.917
Nonetheless, this latest
incident has heightened concerns

39:00.000 --> 39:01.708
about planetary security.

39:01.792 --> 39:04.250
President Clark is set
to be considering a new plan

39:04.333 --> 39:06.583
that will provide Earth
with greater security.

39:06.667 --> 39:09.667
Off.
Unbelievable.

39:09.750 --> 39:11.417
You look pretty good
for a dead man.

39:11.500 --> 39:14.125
We did something to help Earth,
but the way it's been reported

39:14.208 --> 39:15.875
you'd think we were the menace.

39:15.958 --> 39:18.875
Well, you know what they say,
no good deed goes unpunished.

39:18.958 --> 39:21.833
The important thing is,
we got away with it.

39:27.292 --> 39:29.083
So far.

39:39.083 --> 39:40.875
I thought there was a meeting.

39:40.958 --> 39:43.292
There is but it doesn't start
for another half an hour.

39:43.375 --> 39:45.000
I wanted a chance
to talk to you alone.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.625
About what?

39:46.708 --> 39:50.375
Like I said the other day,
we've been getting reports

39:50.458 --> 39:52.750
that Earthforce
may have been infiltrated

39:52.833 --> 39:55.583
by traitors right up
to the command level.

39:55.667 --> 39:59.917
Any unusual behavior is to be
reported and investigated.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.458
Yeah, so?

40:02.542 --> 40:07.083
So, the captain was gone
for four days.

40:07.167 --> 40:09.375
Our records don't show
any absence, but I checked

40:09.458 --> 40:11.833
the access panel
in his quarters.

40:11.917 --> 40:15.042
It hasn't been used
since Monday.

40:15.125 --> 40:19.750
Now, I'd say that that qualifies
as unusual behavior.

40:19.833 --> 40:21.333
The ministry agrees.

40:21.417 --> 40:23.458
You shouldn't have gone to them
without telling me.

40:23.542 --> 40:27.000
I don't need your permission,
Zack. This is my job.

40:27.083 --> 40:29.292
He's apparently enlisted some
of the other guys in security

40:29.375 --> 40:30.833
to cover whatever he's doing.

40:30.917 --> 40:33.500
That means he's got the chief
in his pocket.

40:35.042 --> 40:37.833
You're close to the chief.

40:37.917 --> 40:40.958
No, no way in hell.
I won't do it.

40:41.042 --> 40:44.000
Look, all I'm asking you
to do is to go to him

40:44.083 --> 40:45.417
be real earnest,
tell him

40:45.500 --> 40:48.292
that you know something's going
on and you wanna help.

40:48.375 --> 40:50.458
Yeah, well,
ever since I joined up

40:50.542 --> 40:53.500
with you guys, he doesn't
trust me like he used to.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.667
If he could trust me,
he'd have brought me

40:55.750 --> 40:57.000
into this this thing weeks ago.

40:57.083 --> 40:58.333
So, you admit
something's going on

40:58.417 --> 41:00.042
and you've been seeing
the same things I have.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.375
I didn't say that!

41:02.458 --> 41:06.833
Look, things are a little tough
between us

41:06.917 --> 41:08.875
right now,
but he's still a friend.

41:08.958 --> 41:10.042
Well, you better start deciding

41:10.125 --> 41:11.917
which is more important
to you, Zack.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.708
Friendship or your job,
which is to protect Earth.

41:17.250 --> 41:20.125
When you figure that out,
you let me know.

41:21.500 --> 41:24.042
[intense music]

41:37.125 --> 41:38.875
[doorbell rings]

41:38.958 --> 41:40.333
Come.

41:41.792 --> 41:43.833
I thought you might want
to see this.

41:43.917 --> 41:46.625
As I recall, you were somewhat
concerned about where I fit

41:46.708 --> 41:50.083
in the great organizational
scheme of things.

41:50.167 --> 41:53.583
So I went to the effort
of preparing this chart.

41:53.667 --> 41:57.625
Now then, here's you, right here
at the heart of everything.

41:57.708 --> 42:00.167
And why not?
And here's me.

42:00.250 --> 42:02.667
This is the captain.
Here's Franklin.

42:02.750 --> 42:03.917
Here's my mum and dad.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.458
They don't actually have
anything to do with it

42:05.542 --> 42:06.917
but it's a very good picture
of them, don't you think?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.417
[chuckles]
Marcus.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.375
I actually think I've come up
with a way to explain

42:10.458 --> 42:12.583
the organizational structure
of Babylon 5

42:12.667 --> 42:16.542
using the Ottoman Empire
as a model.

42:16.625 --> 42:18.750
It gets a little confusing
around this bit here

42:18.833 --> 42:21.583
but one has to start somewhere.

42:21.667 --> 42:23.417
Why are you doing this?

42:23.500 --> 42:25.000
Did it make you laugh?

42:26.208 --> 42:27.667
Yes.

42:27.750 --> 42:29.875
Then my job here is done.
Have a good..

42:29.958 --> 42:31.167
[transmitter beeps]

42:31.250 --> 42:34.625
- Yes?
- 'Susan, quick, turn on ISN.'

42:34.708 --> 42:37.625
Monitor on. Find ISN.

42:37.708 --> 42:40.625
(woman over TV)
And to confirm earlier reports,
President Clark has signed

42:40.708 --> 42:42.583
a decree today
declaring martial law

42:42.667 --> 42:46.667
throughout Earth Central citing
threats to planetary security.

42:46.750 --> 42:48.375
He's expected to provide
information

42:48.458 --> 42:50.667
to support this action
at a closed meeting

42:50.750 --> 42:53.125
'of the full Earth Senate
tomorrow.'

42:53.208 --> 42:56.583
'We repeat,
Earth is now under martial law.'

43:03.875 --> 43:06.042
[theme music]
