<i>In loving memory of Angelo,
thank you for everything you taught me.</i>

00:12.201 --> 00:15.101
<i>Being powerful is like being a lady.</i>

<i>If you need to prove it, you're not.

00:19.203 --> 00:22.903
<i>What do you think of the fame of your son?
A reporter asked to my mother.</i>

00:22.904 --> 00:28.104
<i>Oh - she replied: "he was a scoundrel
since he was a child." Errol Flynn.</i>

<i>"Elected by the people, elected by God."</i>

02:00.801 --> 02:02.561
<i>Show me the pussy.</i>

02:05.841 --> 02:07.640
<i>Suck my cock.</i>

02:07.641 --> 02:09.601
50 bucks more.

02:19.321 --> 02:20.921
<i>Done.</i>

02:29.241 --> 02:30.361
What?

02:31.761 --> 02:33.121
<i>The bubbles.</i>

03:56.761 --> 03:58.721
<i>We are coming to get you.</i>

07:07.521 --> 07:10.121
- Good morning.
- Hello, George, hello.

07:11.641 --> 07:13.161
Same as always?

07:37.241 --> 07:39.960
The point is that I grew up very lonely.

07:39.961 --> 07:43.921
As far as I remember, I was always afraid
of anything sexual.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.922
Bataille !

07:51.601 --> 07:53.881
You look more handsome, George.

07:57.561 --> 08:02.161
He is always willing to help, even if
they try to hurt him.

08:03.641 --> 08:07.001
Pier, in that regard,
is a special person.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.361
He wants everyone
really love each other.

08:12.641 --> 08:15.481
In fact, he is the one
who taught me to love well.

08:18.601 --> 08:20.961
<i>Will you let me take some pictures?</i>

08:22.201 --> 08:23.321
Okay.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.081
Take off your bra.

08:56.201 --> 08:58.161
Also
panties, take them off.

09:00.161 --> 09:01.281
Take them off.

09:03.201 --> 09:04.801
Good.

09:07.961 --> 09:09.801
Now put the cap on.

09:10.641 --> 09:11.880
No.

09:11.881 --> 09:13.561
Come on, put it on.
Put the cap on.

09:20.121 --> 09:21.961
Okay.

09:28.761 --> 09:29.801
Not bad.

09:40.001 --> 09:42.501
This will be the album cover.

10:17.881 --> 10:19.641
<i>Am I thin?</i>

10:23.081 --> 10:24.841
<i>You didn't even take a look.</i>

10:30.641 --> 10:32.601
<i>Do I look old?</i>

10:35.281 --> 10:36.561
<i>You swear?</i>

11:54.481 --> 11:56.001
Are you Bea?

12:07.121 --> 12:08.481
Pick it up.

12:09.801 --> 12:11.761
The dish with cat milk?

12:19.641 --> 12:21.601
Put it over there.

12:31.681 --> 12:33.641
Now sit on.

12:51.281 --> 12:53.401
Now get up.

14:17.681 --> 14:20.800
We stood there, stunned.
But then he suddenly returned

14:20.801 --> 14:23.080
with his potty, stopped right on the carpet,

14:23.081 --> 14:26.880
pulled his underpants down,
and squatted there ahead of us.

14:26.881 --> 14:29.481
We died laughing, remember?

14:30.921 --> 14:33.881
- I was not there that night, in fact.
- Really?

14:34.601 --> 14:37.281
I was sure you were there.

14:39.361 --> 14:41.680
Well, back to us.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.000
Everyone is saying

14:44.001 --> 14:47.720
this is the right time for our business.

14:47.721 --> 14:52.120
There is a high demand for
welness centers and spas.

14:52.121 --> 14:54.040
I showed you the new brochures.

14:54.041 --> 14:57.120
- They're good, right?
- Yes, I saw them, but I come for something else.

14:57.121 --> 15:00.120
I came to talk about the delay
of 4 months' rent.

15:00.121 --> 15:02.541
You are 20,000 euros behind.

15:02.881 --> 15:05.800
I did everything I could.
I've thought a lot.

15:05.801 --> 15:09.681
The only way out is to sell the villa.

15:10.641 --> 15:14.760
Well, it's not like I'm 20,000 behind.

15:14.761 --> 15:18.120
I'm waiting 20,000 euros they owe me.
It's a little different.

15:18.121 --> 15:20.760
You have to be patient.

15:20.761 --> 15:22.400
After all, you pushed me:

15:22.401 --> 15:25.800
"Elisa, you've inherited your parents' villa.
Don't you open your own business?

15:25.801 --> 15:28.880
You're too talented to be a schoolteacher".

15:28.881 --> 15:30.961
And now I have to sell the villa because
we're waiting for 20,000 euros?!?

15:31.761 --> 15:34.321
The money will come, we will wait.

15:34.761 --> 15:36.721
Money that's still due
no longer counts.

15:37.281 --> 15:39.680
- Not even for me?
- It's not about you.

15:39.681 --> 15:42.840
- There's something wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

15:42.841 --> 15:47.281
Unfortunately, we're going through hard times.
You, me, everyone!

15:47.681 --> 15:50.921
I did everything I could.
I talked with my colleagues, with the director.

15:51.161 --> 15:53.040
We've analyzed the budget.

15:53.041 --> 15:56.760
But there are exactly 20,000
euros we need to cover.

15:56.761 --> 16:00.920
So the solution is to sell the
home now, or lose tomorrow.

16:02.201 --> 16:05.000
Sorry, but there's
nothing we can do.

16:05.001 --> 16:08.860
It's not your fault, not mine or anyone.

16:19.481 --> 16:21.681
May I have a glass of water, please?

16:25.641 --> 16:27.200
<i>Sorry if I smoke.</i>

16:27.201 --> 16:30.440
<i>But it's the first thing I
smoke since I woke up.</i>

16:30.441 --> 16:32.760
<i>As soon as I get up and out of bed,</i>

16:32.761 --> 16:35.480
<i>I'm stalked by my husband's cats.</i>

16:35.481 --> 16:38.157
<i>They follow me.
 They wait for me outside the bathroom.</i>

16:38.182 --> 16:39.520
<i>They stare at me.
They want to be fed, to be petted.</i>

16:39.521 --> 16:44.040
<i>When you get up, you need
your time, your coffee, your cigar.</i>

16:44.041 --> 16:47.241
Not being chased by cats, staring at me.

16:48.481 --> 16:51.960
I'd kill them. All of them.
Except Tabby.

16:51.961 --> 16:54.880
<i>Tabby is nice. She's beautiful.</i>

16:54.881 --> 16:58.321
<i>Everyone says it's cute.
Even the postman said it.</i>

17:01.081 --> 17:04.700
<i>I told Bea to wear
something nice for you.</i>

17:04.701 --> 17:07.440
<i>Isn't it true that she was dressed
much better when she first met you?</i>

17:07.441 --> 17:09.960
<i>She always looks better
when I pick the clothes for her.</i>

17:09.961 --> 17:12.359
<i>Bea is a good girl.
She can write very well.</i>

17:12.361 --> 17:14.420
I'm sure you already admire her.

17:14.421 --> 17:17.881
So you can help her
working in a major newspaper.

17:17.882 --> 17:22.720
My girl is extraordinary.
It is special, a special daughter.

17:22.721 --> 17:27.099
<i>Elvis's mother used to say that his son was special.
He was her jewel.</i>

17:27.121 --> 17:29.840
<i>You ask Bea and Bea will do it.</i>

17:29.841 --> 17:33.200
Even Elvis became Elvis 
thanks to Colonel Parker.

17:33.201 --> 17:35.840
His manager, the Colonel.

17:35.841 --> 17:37.361
Do you remember him?

17:39.921 --> 17:41.720
The capital of Estonia?

17:41.721 --> 17:43.441
- Tallinn.
- Yes!

18:33.361 --> 18:35.440
What do you prefer, Pier?

18:35.441 --> 18:37.041
You choose.

19:07.201 --> 19:09.961
Did I tell you about my mother?

19:14.081 --> 19:16.681
Send them the first and the third piece.

19:23.401 --> 19:25.161
The fact is...

19:26.241 --> 19:29.280
My mother always says she was born in '68

19:29.281 --> 19:30.961
A year after my father.

19:33.241 --> 19:36.560
But yesterday, by chance, I saw her
identification.

19:36.561 --> 19:40.081
I found out she was born in '64.

19:40.961 --> 19:42.801
Can you imagine? In 64.

19:47.081 --> 19:49.160
Imagine she dies.

19:49.161 --> 19:54.240
You go to her funeral. There will be
relatives and friends asking you:

19:54.241 --> 19:57.921
"How old was your mother?"
You answer: "70 years."

19:58.761 --> 20:03.200
Then you read the obituary
and it says 74.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.960
Damn, can you imagine that?

20:04.961 --> 20:06.401
What?

20:43.081 --> 20:47.361
Sara... I think, Von Sternberg's
walking stick was just like this.

20:48.201 --> 20:51.241
His walking stick was his penis, of course.

20:59.921 --> 21:04.281
Come on, Matteo, enjoy one bit! 
You have three whistles.

21:36.721 --> 21:38.761
This is the only newspaper of Italy...

21:46.401 --> 21:50.081
Hi, this is the only newspaper in Italy
totally self-funded.

22:29.961 --> 22:33.481
This is the only newspaper in Italy
fully self-financed...

22:34.601 --> 22:36.361
You look good, you know?

23:03.561 --> 23:07.001
When was the last time?
Ten years ago?

23:12.841 --> 23:14.881
Do you remember the airplane?

23:49.321 --> 23:54.200
When I started
this guy was the most important art critic.

23:54.201 --> 23:57.840
One day I met him at the left
winged convention.

23:57.841 --> 24:01.000
They spoke of offering
exhibition spaces for young artists.

24:01.001 --> 24:04.720
The man then said he wanted
to open a gallery

24:04.721 --> 24:06.800
<i>between Via Della Moscova and Garibaldi.</i>

24:06.801 --> 24:09.380
<i>where he would only have new artists</i>

24:09.381 --> 24:11.681
<i>who haven't had solo exhibitions yet.</i>

24:11.681 --> 24:14.120
So after the meeting,
I introduced myself and talked to him.

24:14.121 --> 24:16.180
I said I was a young painter.

24:16.281 --> 24:21.480
That my work was exhibited at
Berlin, Rotterdam, Paris and so on.

24:21.481 --> 24:24.561
<i>But not in Italy, not in my Milan.</i>

24:25.401 --> 24:28.840
<i>So he asked me if
had an agent, a politician,</i>

24:28.841 --> 24:31.920
<i>a friend or a journalist
to sponsor me.</i>

24:31.921 --> 24:33.800
<i>I said no.</i>

24:33.801 --> 24:37.401
<i>He replies:
"No way then."</i>

24:38.401 --> 24:40.640
So I ask him if I can at least show him

24:40.641 --> 24:42.641
some of my work, my art book.

24:42.641 --> 24:45.280
And he replies:
"If you really think so..."

24:45.281 --> 24:47.481
What a jerk, right?

24:48.001 --> 24:50.440
Well, finally he opened his gallery

24:50.441 --> 24:53.440
and was interviewed by all the left-wing 
snob journalists

24:53.441 --> 24:56.440
<i>where he says he wanted 
to give space to new artists,</i>

24:56.441 --> 24:58.641
<i>new talent and bullshit like this.</i>

24:59.001 --> 25:00.521
Slower, darling!

25:02.201 --> 25:04.480
<i>But when he opened the gallery</i>

25:04.481 --> 25:06.480
<i>he actually exhibits only
of famous artists.</i>

25:06.481 --> 25:10.841
And no fucking critic
or journalist did see.

25:11.601 --> 25:14.520
Well, to be brief.
Ten years passed.

25:14.521 --> 25:16.720
Some friendships have changed.

25:16.721 --> 25:19.760
A few days ago I was
at a bankruptcy sale...

25:19.761 --> 25:21.840
and I bought his house.

25:21.841 --> 25:23.840
<i>Now all his galleries are closed</i>

25:23.841 --> 25:25.841
<i>and he lives in a boarding house.</i>

25:25.841 --> 25:29.400
<i>Giorgio knows him,
he met him the other day at the Bar Mozart,</i>

25:29.401 --> 25:34.080
and the guy asked for someone
who might help him.

25:34.081 --> 25:37.521
<i>I went to the boarding house
where he lives,</i>

25:37.661 --> 25:40.240
<i>I rang the bell, he opened the door.</i>

25:40.241 --> 25:42.741
And I was there with my pants down.

25:42.941 --> 25:45.080
<i>and I shat a nice turd in front of him.</i>

25:45.081 --> 25:47.940
<i>He didn't know what to say.
He didn't recognize me.</i>

25:47.941 --> 25:50.241
He was paralyzed from fear, or perhaps
by the urge to cry.

25:51.242 --> 25:54.942
No, he was actually paralyzed
with shame.

26:47.761 --> 26:51.361
My friend, doesn't this
unite us more than all the art world?

27:06.321 --> 27:07.841
Do you...?

27:09.681 --> 27:12.361
like when I come inside?

27:13.361 --> 27:14.941
Yes.

27:24.761 --> 27:27.280
So why don't you tell me?

27:27.281 --> 27:30.680
I mean, sometimes I wish...

27:30.681 --> 27:34.721
What do you want me to say?
"I like when you come inside me."

27:55.961 --> 27:58.160
- Yes?
- Hi, I'm Sara.

27:58.161 --> 27:59.360
I have an appointment with Benny.

27:59.361 --> 28:02.160
- Benny is not here.
- Well, I'll wait for him upstairs.

28:02.161 --> 28:04.201
<i>He's not coming at the office today.</i>

28:11.121 --> 28:15.561
Sara, dear, I'm sorry.
I have arrived late.

28:15.641 --> 28:17.800
- It does not matter.
- How are you?

28:17.801 --> 28:20.680
Fine, it did not take me too long
to come here.

28:20.681 --> 28:22.641
- That's good then.
- Yes.

28:23.281 --> 28:25.440
Listen, I have to tell you something.

28:25.441 --> 28:28.040
I can't produce your movie.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.120
What are you talking about?
Next week...

28:30.121 --> 28:32.280
I think I'm not the right producer
for your movie.

28:32.281 --> 28:35.440
 I've thought a lot.
For a project like that I'm not right.

28:35.441 --> 28:38.960
Your story is of a type
that's not possible to finance.

28:38.961 --> 28:42.120
And without funding,
you're not going anywhere in this country.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.560
Unless you have contacts
politicians. I do not have.

28:44.561 --> 28:47.120
Had one in the Democratic Party but it's gone...

28:47.121 --> 28:50.280
- And you found out now?
- No no no...

28:50.281 --> 28:52.080
I did not found now.

28:52.081 --> 28:54.560
True when I read the script
for the first time...

28:54.561 --> 28:57.740
Wait a minute, Benny.

28:57.741 --> 29:00.320
We have been working on this project for a year.

29:00.321 --> 29:04.200
Last week we chose the actors 
and we went to scout locations...

29:04.201 --> 29:08.080
You know it very well.
Wait a minute, let me talk.

29:08.081 --> 29:13.040
At this point, I don't know,
I thought the film was to be made.

29:13.041 --> 29:15.720
That's how it used to be,
but things are different now.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.880
But you're not even listening to me.

29:17.881 --> 29:21.400
I'm not saying your movie is not going to happen.
I'm just saying I can't do it.

29:21.401 --> 29:25.600
But there is a solution. This movie,
yours, you make it by yourself.

29:25.601 --> 29:27.761
I know a lot of people who can

29:27.762 --> 29:30.162
help. Young people from the Film School.

29:32.361 --> 29:34.980
Hell, are very good people,
young, crazy about the movies.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.040
They want to work and
they are extremely talented.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.680
Of course they're not as
mature talent as you,

29:39.681 --> 29:43.840
they're immature, young, but with
hunger to tell a story.

29:43.841 --> 29:47.240
Believe me, with very little money
all production is done.

29:47.241 --> 29:50.521
You or your parents must have some savings.

29:50.741 --> 29:55.120
Anyway, what you need is a low budget.
It will not be that difficult.

29:55.121 --> 29:56.481
Sorry.

29:58.441 --> 29:59.840
You can wait, listen.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.240
Bresson once said:

30:01.241 --> 30:04.721
"Youngster will come and they will make 
their own films with their own money."

30:05.441 --> 30:07.400
Wonderful.
Wait a second.

30:07.401 --> 30:09.640
I have to go sign some papers.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.040
Then we have a cup of coffee and talk.

30:12.041 --> 30:14.241
Is it okay?
You will wait for me?

30:15.961 --> 30:19.560
Sorry. A small thing.
It says: AD 007.

30:19.561 --> 30:23.280
007, my license plate.
My dream since I was a child.

30:23.281 --> 30:24.561
Wait for me!

31:04.361 --> 31:05.641
Romy.

31:06.601 --> 31:09.121
Good morning, teacher.

31:13.361 --> 31:15.721
I will show you your rooms in few moments.

31:17.961 --> 31:20.721
We're going to meet once a week,
more or less.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.921
Pier preferres Mondays.

31:26.481 --> 31:28.761
We call you and we pick you up.

31:29.961 --> 31:34.001
As I said, there is nothing
special to know.

31:34.921 --> 31:37.400
It's just afternoons with friends.

31:37.401 --> 31:40.361
We joke, hang out, play games.

31:40.921 --> 31:42.601
Normal things.

31:43.641 --> 31:45.761
Tell him your dreams.

31:46.601 --> 31:49.801
Pier wants only to be kind to him.

31:50.281 --> 31:52.000
Do whatever he asks,

31:52.001 --> 31:55.380
and in the end you'll get
what you asked for.

31:55.381 --> 31:59.521
Don't tell anyone about this.
Least of all on the phone.

32:00.601 --> 32:02.641
Consider yourself really lucky.

32:03.321 --> 32:06.601
These days, everyone wants to be here.

32:16.201 --> 32:17.481
<i>Let's go.</i>

32:23.681 --> 32:26.481
- Have you ever meet Valentino?
- Who?

32:28.182 --> 32:29.382
The racing pilot.

32:29.401 --> 32:33.761
Maybe someone introduced him at a party.
Do you have a painkiller?

32:36.641 --> 32:40.200
<i>The sun has always been a symbol of beauty
and energy.</i>

32:40.201 --> 32:44.000
<i>Its own virtue inspires this
welness center - "The Sun Temple."</i>

32:44.001 --> 32:47.160
<i>All treatments are inspired by the same philosophy.</i>

32:47.561 --> 32:49.800
<i>True wellness can only</i>

32:49.801 --> 32:52.000
<i>exist when the flow of energy runs free,</i>

32:52.001 --> 32:55.520
<i>creating harmony between body and mind.</i>

32:55.521 --> 32:57.841
- What do you think?
- You write well.

32:57.842 --> 32:59.242
Thanks.

32:59.561 --> 33:02.440
Everyone says that this time is
just right for a business like this.

33:02.441 --> 33:06.000
- Many spa holidays are sold...
- What did you do before?

33:06.001 --> 33:10.480
I used to be a high school teacher and
before that I wrote for a newspaper,

33:10.481 --> 33:13.921
but now newspapers are
extincted, so the teachers.

33:14.241 --> 33:17.681
Write something for me, as a gift.

33:18.441 --> 33:20.080
Okay.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.880
But, what would you like me to write?

33:22.881 --> 33:26.721
- A text, a presentation...
- This seems to be a beautiful place.

33:27.081 --> 33:29.160
That is my Villa.

33:29.161 --> 33:30.720
Why don't you live there now?

33:30.721 --> 33:34.081
Close the business, enjoy the landscape and
write something for me.

33:56.761 --> 33:58.601
Are you crazy?

34:17.920 --> 34:20.761
She told me I'll never be a real singer.

34:24.081 --> 34:26.281
Why not?

34:26.501 --> 34:29.001
Because he's not sincere.

34:34.841 --> 34:38.080
The little green horse drove the town crazy

34:38.081 --> 34:42.719
truly everyone: children,
grandparents, bankers,

34:42.721 --> 34:47.719
ice cream makers, barbers, teachers,
drivers, workers, jugglers.

34:47.721 --> 34:51.920
Even the guard stadium,
all went to see his race.

34:59.521 --> 35:03.281
The race always took place at 
the old abandoned soap factory.

35:03.921 --> 35:07.720
His opponents were: Flash,
Wind, North Star,

35:07.721 --> 35:11.600
Shalpy, Yellow Mint, Sister Pegasus.

35:11.601 --> 35:14.160
All fastest thoroughbred in the country

35:14.161 --> 35:17.160
who had won more races
than any other champions.

35:17.161 --> 35:18.800
Their jockeys were the most popular

35:18.801 --> 35:20.400
among all families and women of Italy.

35:20.401 --> 35:23.081
Fuck, these modern games.

35:23.761 --> 35:27.400
The little green horse... no one knew
who he was or where he came from.

35:27.401 --> 35:31.760
He didn't belong to anyone, liked
only children and the elderly.

35:31.761 --> 35:36.801
But the elderly without glasses. They were
the only ones allowed to touch him.

35:37.521 --> 35:41.120
And everyone said:
Ah, if only the show "Search The Cockerel"

35:41.121 --> 35:44.160
were still running every Sunday

35:44.161 --> 35:48.880
then they would be here to film us
and interview.

35:48.881 --> 35:51.241
That story is freaking me.

35:51.561 --> 35:55.480
And the little green horse
ran so fast that Yellow Mint

35:55.481 --> 35:57.880
after three laps he began to cry terribly.

35:57.881 --> 36:00.440
While Flash said he would only run

36:00.441 --> 36:05.680
at the city center bank, where there is a large lounge
because it has no competitors there.

36:05.681 --> 36:10.680
Children screamed and you couldn't see
a single old person with glasses

36:10.681 --> 36:13.441
because the little green horse
didn't like them, and nobody knew why.

36:15.961 --> 36:17.641
Hey, give me the number.

36:20.761 --> 36:24.161
336 123 123 7.

36:53.121 --> 36:55.200
Shit, she was a virgin.

36:55.201 --> 36:57.881
Fuck, I passed next level!

36:58.721 --> 37:02.120
And the little green horse crossed 
the finish line for the ninth time

37:02.121 --> 37:04.520
and everyone thought the day was over

37:04.521 --> 37:06.420
because in a few hours it would be Monday.

37:06.421 --> 37:08.860
And all would have to return to work.

37:08.861 --> 37:12.960
But thanks to the little green horse,
Sunday would be three times more!

37:12.961 --> 37:15.920
The people celebrated, ate and listened to music!

37:15.921 --> 37:18.160
What a champion the little green horse!

37:18.161 --> 37:21.521
A champion inside and outside
the race track.

37:28.961 --> 37:31.721
Have you been in many cities for business?

37:37.921 --> 37:39.320
Like what?

37:39.321 --> 37:44.480
Paris, Berlin, London, Moscow,
Santiago de Chile, Rio de Janeiro

37:44.481 --> 37:46.761
New Delhi, etc, etc.

37:49.801 --> 37:53.001
In what city you want to live?

37:57.641 --> 38:01.361
I would like to live in Africa
or South America.

38:02.441 --> 38:04.961
People are poor but happy.

38:05.641 --> 38:10.121
Because they live with what they have,
the sun is shining and warm.

38:11.321 --> 38:16.081
There are fruits and don't care
about the things we have here.

38:20.521 --> 38:21.801
Why?

38:24.121 --> 38:26.081
Pier, I love you.

38:26.801 --> 38:29.321
Everyone thinks your life is weird...

38:30.561 --> 38:34.601
But I think you're just unhappy.

38:36.921 --> 38:40.120
I'm just a stupid girl with
stupid dreams, but...

38:40.121 --> 38:47.520
I understand that everything
you do, you do because...

38:47.521 --> 38:52.881
You are sensitive and know how to love.

39:09.282 --> 39:13.282
<B> PIER-VIS THE PELVIS </ b>.

39:27.721 --> 39:31.400
<i>Tell me, the other day
at the party</i>

39:31.401 --> 39:34.961
<i>With the two girls, did you fuck them?</i>

39:37.601 --> 39:40.720
<i>Can you believe that?
You are saying that the only reason</i>

39:40.721 --> 39:44.880
<i>you wouldn't fuck those two girls
was not to hurt me.</i>

39:44.881 --> 39:47.360
<i>But you're not the jealous type, right?</i>

39:47.361 --> 39:49.320
<i>You're not jealous of me.</i>

39:49.321 --> 39:52.601
<i>Can you tell me why not?</i>

39:56.841 --> 39:59.640
<i>Do you remember one night in the dining room</i>

39:59.641 --> 40:01.840
<i>when we were sitting at the table, next to</i>

40:01.841 --> 40:04.440
<i>a naval officer and those other two officers?</i>

40:04.441 --> 40:08.401
<i>I could not stop thinking about him.</i>

40:11.202 --> 40:13.602
<i>And yet, at no time, was he ever out of my mind.</i>

40:14.041 --> 40:17.760
I was sure that if I had wanted me
even for one night only,

40:17.761 --> 40:20.160
I was ready to give up everything.

40:20.161 --> 40:23.521
My whole fucking future with you,
everything.

40:24.321 --> 40:28.161
And the strangest thing was that at the same time
I loved you more than ever.

40:29.681 --> 40:34.040
And my love for you was a love...

40:34.041 --> 40:37.161
tender, but sad.

40:43.081 --> 40:44.201
Score!

41:01.161 --> 41:04.601
Yesterday I read a phrase I can't
get out of my head.

41:05.921 --> 41:08.220
Art is not a mirror reflecting

41:08.221 --> 41:11.120
the world, but a hammer to carve it.

41:11.121 --> 41:13.200
Do you think that's true?

41:13.201 --> 41:14.801
I think so.

41:14.802 --> 41:16.902
- It's Mayakovsky.
- I know.

41:18.321 --> 41:20.281
You look a little like him.

41:36.481 --> 41:40.441
I'd like to interview you for the newspaper.
Do you think I could?

41:41.041 --> 41:44.440
I'm sure you have many
interesting things to say.

41:44.441 --> 41:46.961
I don't want to end up like Amy Winehouse.

42:04.921 --> 42:07.441
You know, I wish you knew my mother.

42:08.121 --> 42:10.801
Well, more or less,
won't be a problem.

42:11.601 --> 42:14.760
Because she always says I'm with people
badly dressed

42:14.761 --> 42:16.240
because they all are communists.

42:16.241 --> 42:20.201
I'm sure if you could see her,
she will change her mind.

42:23.561 --> 42:26.161
Do you think I'm well dressed?

43:37.041 --> 43:38.721
What happens?

43:41.481 --> 43:43.981
My dog Brian is dead.

43:48.121 --> 43:50.840
It was only four years younger than me.

43:50.841 --> 43:52.321
I'm sorry.

43:55.001 --> 43:57.841
I was also very sad
when my dog died.

44:02.001 --> 44:03.521
What was its name?

44:04.521 --> 44:05.961
His name was Tommy.

44:08.321 --> 44:11.601
It was the last gift from
my father before he died.

44:13.081 --> 44:19.560
So when Tommy died...

44:19.561 --> 44:24.001
It was like I lost my father twice.

44:28.161 --> 44:29.521
Can I?

44:31.681 --> 44:33.721
Did I tell you about my movie?

44:35.281 --> 44:36.561
No.

44:38.041 --> 44:40.200
It's about social networks.

44:40.201 --> 44:42.760
- Really?
- Yes.

44:42.761 --> 44:47.240
Practically it's about a group of young
Milanese high society.

44:47.241 --> 44:49.881
Those who go to the best schools like
Leone or San Carlo.

44:51.001 --> 44:54.961
You know, I met many of them.

44:57.601 --> 45:01.400
A group of these guys created
fake Facebook profiles

45:01.401 --> 45:03.200
to expose pedophile priests.

45:03.201 --> 45:06.120
But they discovered some
hidden secrets of the Vatican

45:06.121 --> 45:08.200
and they were locked up in secret cells
of the Basilica of San Pedro.

45:08.201 --> 45:12.200
The keys are thrown away, and they are now
sentenced to the death penalty. Crazy.

45:15.521 --> 45:18.680
Do you know that the Vatican
is the only state in Europe,

45:18.681 --> 45:20.521
still it has the death penalty?

45:26.321 --> 45:29.520
I got the idea when I read
"Sex and the Vatican,"

45:29.521 --> 45:32.561
and then some interviews on the internet.

45:34.881 --> 45:38.720
I do not know, I would be ashamed
to show my face,

45:38.721 --> 45:41.440
but they do not care, continue 
with the pontificate

45:41.441 --> 45:44.160
and even create Facebook accounts.

45:44.161 --> 45:47.201
The Facebook should only
be used for business.

45:52.161 --> 45:56.480
Marta says it's bullshit.
That is an obvious thing.

45:56.481 --> 45:58.921
But the important thing is how
you do the film, right?

45:58.922 --> 46:00.322
Course.

46:03.521 --> 46:06.201
I think she's just envious.

46:08.081 --> 46:09.761
She is a communist.

46:10.881 --> 46:13.081
The Italy of hatred.

46:14.601 --> 46:16.441
But love always wins.

46:26.561 --> 46:28.521
No, no, leave it on.

46:33.161 --> 46:34.741
Kneel.

47:24.161 --> 47:27.121
Damn, every time
is more complicated!

48:02.761 --> 48:04.921
- Good morning, sir.
- Easy, easy.

48:20.321 --> 48:23.001
- Want?
- No, thank you, George.

48:29.321 --> 48:32.761
"There is nothing more fragile than
beauty of women.

48:33.241 --> 48:36.600
Just a knife in the hands of a black man,

48:36.601 --> 48:40.560
and in three movements your pearl, your idol,

48:40.561 --> 48:44.201
your masterpiece of creation,
will look like the head of a skinned calf."

48:58.841 --> 49:01.121
"The Portrait of an Englishman in his Chateau"

49:01.841 --> 49:03.441
Bravo, George.

49:05.041 --> 49:08.600
If I were capable of love
probably I'd get married

49:08.601 --> 49:10.760
and faithfully would love my wife,

49:10.761 --> 49:13.721
through all the trials
and the greatest sacrifices.

49:15.561 --> 49:17.841
But love is a worn-out word.

49:37.481 --> 49:41.681
Mom, Dad left me something in his will?

49:42.321 --> 49:43.941
Sure, Matteo.

49:43.942 --> 49:46.442
I mean something specific,
something just for me.

49:46.743 --> 49:49.943
Something that belonged to him 
just for me.

49:50.521 --> 49:53.521
What do I know? A book, a pen, his glasses?

49:55.521 --> 49:58.561
- I don't know.
- He didn't...

50:24.761 --> 50:26.601
Walk in circles.

50:43.001 --> 50:44.121
Stop!

50:47.321 --> 50:48.761
Get down.

50:51.321 --> 50:53.581
You've got one on your right,
and another on the left.

50:54.321 --> 50:58.280
One is your girlfriend, the other
is your mother. Choose one.

50:58.281 --> 51:02.520
The one you don't fuck,
will lick your cum on the other's thigh.

51:02.521 --> 51:03.861
Good luck.

52:09.841 --> 52:11.441
Are you retarded?

52:14.201 --> 52:16.321
Do you always do what you are told, right?

52:19.681 --> 52:21.041
Idiot.

52:41.001 --> 52:42.441
Tell me.

52:43.241 --> 52:46.760
We have to answer the questions 
for the TV show by Monday

52:46.761 --> 52:49.720
in the order they made for us.

52:49.721 --> 52:52.481
- Can you see them tonight?
- No.

52:53.641 --> 52:55.420
I'll give you the list early morning.

52:55.421 --> 52:58.200
You can read while you're heading to the airport.

52:58.201 --> 53:00.560
I have sent you the Brussels schedule.

53:00.561 --> 53:03.241
- I sent it to you this morning.
- Really?

53:04.761 --> 53:10.280
On Monday, Guenda, the girl I introduced you
at the stadium, won't be able to come.

53:10.291 --> 53:13.080
She's in the hospital.
Someone assaulted her on the street.

53:14.081 --> 53:15.361
Yes?

53:18.041 --> 53:19.561
What are you thinking?

53:21.121 --> 53:23.440
I think: Romy, who really loves you?

53:23.441 --> 53:27.401
Who are you engaged to?
Who fucks you? But then I tell you: Really?

53:34.001 --> 53:35.681
Are you all right, Pier?

53:39.801 --> 53:43.241
Romy, how long have you worked for me?

53:45.001 --> 53:46.521
7 years.

53:49.401 --> 53:52.161
Then don't you dare speak to me
this way again.

54:06.321 --> 54:10.241
Sara, greet Brian.
Bea's dog.

54:11.041 --> 54:12.561
Hello, Brian.

54:18.601 --> 54:21.201
<i>Too much heat this morning.</i>

54:33.081 --> 54:34.521
Give him a handjob.

54:39.121 --> 54:42.081
Come on, Bea!
Look what a limp dick!

55:35.241 --> 55:39.601
Honey, do you really think a corpse
can get hard?

56:18.681 --> 56:20.281
A miracle.

56:58.241 --> 57:00.720
I always believed in you.

57:00.721 --> 57:02.921
I could just see looking at you.

57:06.041 --> 57:09.680
The year you had your final exams,
I left school too.

57:09.681 --> 57:12.761
We both left.
Remember, Romy?

57:16.281 --> 57:19.520
Guess, I met Magrassi,
one or two years ago.

57:19.521 --> 57:23.721
He told me he was going to London,
because he was out of opportunities here.

57:24.361 --> 57:26.041
Everybody leaves.

57:27.681 --> 57:31.800
For me it is time to return to teaching.

57:31.801 --> 57:33.921
Do what I do best: teach.

57:35.801 --> 57:38.361
How about you? You are happy?

57:40.921 --> 57:43.361
What a stupid question, right?

57:58.881 --> 58:02.161
<i>"He thought to shave
his beard before leaving.</i>

58:02.481 --> 58:05.720
<i>Because looking himself
in the mirror, he realized</i>

58:05.721 --> 58:09.560
<i>that the little dimple in the chin,
his only weapon of seduction,</i>

58:09.561 --> 58:12.201
<i>it was hidden under hair.</i>

58:14.241 --> 58:18.681
<i>He realized with horror that
he had no razorblades.</i>

58:19.401 --> 58:22.880
<i>Startled, he stumbled
into the laundry basket</i>

58:22.881 --> 58:25.480
<i>lost the grip on the sink...</i>

58:25.481 --> 58:28.440
<i>He tried to grab the shower hose.</i>

58:28.441 --> 58:33.041
<i>But it broke away, crashing on the floor,
with his forehead hitting the blue tiles.</i>

58:33.921 --> 58:38.560
<i>Fate had given him another
dimple, on his forehead.</i>

58:38.561 --> 58:41.521
<i>But unfortunately he had to die to earn it."</i>

59:29.881 --> 59:32.281
You tell him you're leaving.

59:33.681 --> 59:37.320
- Otherwise he will be angry...
- I don't give a fuck!

59:37.321 --> 59:40.560
He's a piece of shit.
He has ruined my life.

59:40.561 --> 59:42.480
He got me into this bloody mess

59:42.481 --> 59:46.080
and when everything explodes,
I'll be the one fucked up, not him.

59:46.081 --> 59:48.960
He'll save his fucking face,
his flabby ass.

59:48.961 --> 59:51.081
and he doesn't even thank me...

01:00:07.841 --> 01:00:09.281
Sorry.

01:00:11.561 --> 01:00:14.161
I just spoke out of jealousy.

01:00:21.241 --> 01:00:24.901
I need to spend some time with my parents.

01:00:27.761 --> 01:00:29.421
All right.

01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:33.201
George will take you there.

01:03:59.241 --> 01:04:02.501
- Are you reading it?
- Yes.

01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:07.401
And?

01:04:08.241 --> 01:04:09.921
You write very well.

01:04:20.521 --> 01:04:23.361
I used to come to this house with my father.

01:04:27.041 --> 01:04:29.881
- Like it?
- Yes, very much.

01:04:45.401 --> 01:04:48.880
What if we moved to London?
Would you like it?

01:04:48.881 --> 01:04:50.401
Yes, of course.

01:06:13.521 --> 01:06:15.881
Come inside me.

01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:11.640
Why didn't you tell me who your father is?

01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:13.720
But I did.

01:11:13.721 --> 01:11:15.280
- Incredible.
- But yes, I did.

01:11:15.281 --> 01:11:17.360
- When we first met.
- No, you did not.

01:11:17.361 --> 01:11:20.400
- I told you he spoke very highly of you.
- You did not tell me.

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:23.521
- That's why I wanted to meet you.
- You did not tell me.

01:11:24.161 --> 01:11:25.400
I told you.

01:11:25.401 --> 01:11:27.800
Do you know how long I know your father?

01:11:27.801 --> 01:11:30.561
- Do you know how long?
- Yes.

01:11:30.562 --> 01:11:31.962
Before you were born.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.921
I know, in fact
we talk about it.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:36.922
What I want to understand what the hell
you're doing here!

01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:39.840
You don't need money, contacts

01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:43.041
or phone number!
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:11:46.401 --> 01:11:48.800
Your father can not understand
what I'm doing

01:11:48.801 --> 01:11:52.000
I'm doing for you, for you,

01:11:52.001 --> 01:11:58.361
For you, for you, for you.
And all to come!

01:12:03.881 --> 01:12:05.641
Go to hell.

01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:27.341
You should have called right away,
now it will be a disaster.

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:29.042
I know.

01:12:32.001 --> 01:12:35.441
But you always said not to use phones.

01:12:52.721 --> 01:12:54.481
Who knows...

01:12:56.361 --> 01:12:58.041
... When...

01:13:00.761 --> 01:13:02.521
... Shall we go?

01:13:52.001 --> 01:13:53.601
Good girl.

01:13:54.361 --> 01:13:57.280
You should have studied in
a convent school.

01:13:57.281 --> 01:13:59.961
They should have made a saint, bitch!

01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:47.120
I need not tell you

01:16:47.121 --> 01:16:50.481
should not say one word
about what happened here.

01:16:52.881 --> 01:16:56.581
Pier arranged your payments in advance.

01:16:56.761 --> 01:16:58.720
So, if you do what I say,

01:16:58.721 --> 01:17:02.001
you'll get your money in 6 or 7 months.

01:17:04.081 --> 01:17:06.640
Yes, and what about his
promises to us?

01:17:06.641 --> 01:17:09.520
I could have found the money  by myself,

01:17:09.521 --> 01:17:11.760
but the contacts...
- I want to know...

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:14.000
What about those people he was
supposed to put me in touch with?

01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:16.480
I didn't do everything I did for nothing.

01:17:16.481 --> 01:17:18.521
He was supposed to help me with my record.

01:17:19.921 --> 01:17:23.400
Obviously that is not possible now.

01:17:23.401 --> 01:17:26.281
Pier is dead.
His name now is worthless.

01:17:30.281 --> 01:17:33.041
Can I keep his books?

01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:36.761
They are the only things of value
the jerk left.

01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:39.720
Yes, but I'm talking about my movie.

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:43.120
Pier had liked my script,
had even spoken with a...

01:17:43.121 --> 01:17:44.600
With whom?

01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:46.641
Stop telling yourself this bullshit.

01:17:47.521 --> 01:17:50.881
Take the money and use it 
for what you can do for real.

01:17:54.161 --> 01:17:56.480
Now do not be afraid.

01:17:56.481 --> 01:17:59.201
What happened, it happened
unfortunately.

01:18:00.481 --> 01:18:04.200
Regardless, you all did very well.
It is true.

01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:08.321
I am pleased with you.
I know you are trustworthy.

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:11.560
Once I find someone

01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:15.001
able to fulfill your real ambitions, 
I will call you.

01:19:09.361 --> 01:19:11.041
"I am...

01:19:11.681 --> 01:19:14.441
the first bride ever...

01:19:16.721 --> 01:19:21.681
... and in the last bride I shall reincarnate.

01:19:23.681 --> 01:19:25.721
Wherever she is...

01:19:28.521 --> 01:19:30.481
... there will be an Eden."

01:19:32.761 --> 01:19:35.160
"Eve's Diary", by Mark Twain

01:19:35.161 --> 01:19:36.981
Well done, Romina.

01:19:50.881 --> 01:19:52.841
<i>What a beautiful little girl.</i>

01:19:56.161 --> 01:19:59.201
Hello, beautiful.
What's your name?

01:20:00.841 --> 01:20:04.201
Her name is Eva.
Like Eva Braun.
