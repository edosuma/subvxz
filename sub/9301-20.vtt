WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:23.322 --> 01:25.415
Alright, now let me get this straight.

01:25.624 --> 01:27.956
This side is supposed to produce flowers?

01:28.327 --> 01:30.420
Yes, but Man-At-Arms, it's...

01:30.429 --> 01:33.129
Orko, if you want me to fix your
magic pyramid, just answer me...

01:33.198 --> 01:34.893
This side makes flowers?

01:37.302 --> 01:39.270
Pft... Mud!

01:39.471 --> 01:43.271
Well? That's what I was trying
to tell ya. It's not working right.

01:45.010 --> 01:48.275
And this side is supposed
to produce... a swan?

01:48.580 --> 01:50.707
Yes, but it's also...

01:50.849 --> 01:53.181
-Orko...

02:00.325 --> 02:02.953
and this side makes fruit, huh?

02:04.062 --> 02:05.757
No. You open it.

02:10.401 --> 02:12.199
I thought you said it was broken.

02:12.404 --> 02:14.668
Well, that's the side that still works.

02:15.007 --> 02:17.271
Well at least, some of your tricks work.

02:17.476 --> 02:19.688
Oh, back in land of Trolla,

02:19.713 --> 02:21.596
all my tricks worked.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.610
You hardly ever talk about Trolla.
Where is it?

02:24.783 --> 02:26.751
In a different astral zone from here.

02:26.952 --> 02:29.216
It's beautiful there.

02:29.721 --> 02:31.484
I'll bet you get homesick.

02:31.657 --> 02:34.785
Yeah, back home, I was a powerful sorcerer.

02:34.927 --> 02:36.394
I had respect.

02:37.129 --> 02:40.394
You, a powerful sorcerer?
That's a good one.

02:40.599 --> 02:44.057
It's true.
They called me Orko the Great.

02:44.803 --> 02:47.020
Well if I were, Orko the Great,

02:47.045 --> 02:49.526
I would stop playing with those meteorites,

02:49.675 --> 02:51.267
'cause they might be dangerous.

02:55.948 --> 02:56.846
What happened?

02:57.015 --> 02:58.346
Those rocks from space...

02:58.550 --> 03:01.383
seem to have a magical
effect on Orko's pyramid.

03:03.155 --> 03:04.179
It's back!

03:05.958 --> 03:08.085
Why, it's a girl Orko!

03:09.394 --> 03:13.160
Where am I?
The Royal Palace, on planet Eternia.

03:13.498 --> 03:16.579
I am Orko,
royal magician in residence,

03:16.604 --> 03:18.425
at your complete and total service.

03:19.438 --> 03:21.838
Boy, is he laying it on thick.

03:22.007 --> 03:23.497
Get the feeling he likes her?

03:25.477 --> 03:27.447
Not, Orko the Great.

03:27.472 --> 03:28.930
You've heard of me?

03:29.314 --> 03:32.681
Everyone in Trolla knows
of Orko the Great.

03:32.851 --> 03:35.046
You're a famous sorcerer.

03:36.455 --> 03:38.013
I don't believe it.

03:38.357 --> 03:39.722
You've come from Trolla?

03:40.325 --> 03:42.088
Yes, I am Dree Elle.

03:42.294 --> 03:45.821
I was hiding from Dragoon
when this box appeared beside me.

03:46.064 --> 03:49.732
I went to look inside,
and it brought me here.

03:49.868 --> 03:52.098
Somehow the meteorites have energized...

03:52.304 --> 03:55.398
it into a shuttle between
Orko's world and ours.

03:55.774 --> 03:58.242
Who is this Dragoon you were hiding from?

03:58.443 --> 04:01.810
An evil monster.
All of Trolla is in danger.

04:01.980 --> 04:06.610
Oh Orko, if only we had
someone like you to help us.

04:07.019 --> 04:07.951
C'mon!

04:09.688 --> 04:11.417
Orko, what are you doing?

04:11.657 --> 04:13.955
I'm going back with Dree Elle.
They need me.

04:14.192 --> 04:16.125
Wait, Orko.  Let us help you.

04:16.327 --> 04:17.659
Yes, it sounds dangerous.

04:17.896 --> 04:19.190
You wouldn't fit in the pyramid.

04:19.297 --> 04:21.288
Besides, I want to do this myself.

04:24.036 --> 04:25.025
He's gone!

04:25.237 --> 04:26.465
I am worried about him.

04:26.638 --> 04:28.799
So am I, but I don't know what we can do.

04:28.974 --> 04:30.100
I do.

04:43.622 --> 04:46.557
Trolla.
Just as I remember it.

04:48.493 --> 04:50.188
Dragoon will hear us.

04:50.262 --> 04:52.696
Let him hear.
You're here with Orko the Great.

04:52.998 --> 04:54.488
Now, tell me about him.

04:54.933 --> 04:59.302
He is half man,
half dragon and breathes fire.

05:01.139 --> 05:03.232
Does it, by any chance, look like that?

05:10.682 --> 05:11.979
Run, Orko.

05:19.491 --> 05:22.858
My magic still works here.  Wow!

05:27.999 --> 05:30.365
Our only hope of following
Orko, is the Sorceress.

05:31.169 --> 05:33.694
By the power of Grayskull.

05:37.776 --> 05:40.336
Oh no, not again.

05:41.480 --> 05:45.246
I have the power!

05:58.730 --> 06:00.729
By the power of Grayskull,

06:00.754 --> 06:03.214
I command the Jawbridge, open!

06:07.973 --> 06:10.407
This is only a temporary portal to Trolla,

06:10.675 --> 06:14.167
and as you can see, it is much too small.

06:14.379 --> 06:15.243
Sorceress...

06:15.480 --> 06:18.574
Do you have the power to make me
small enough to enter the portal?

06:18.817 --> 06:19.806
Yes,

06:19.985 --> 06:21.475
but it is too dangerous.

06:21.686 --> 06:26.055
This portal will vanish at moonrise.
If you're not back by then...

06:26.224 --> 06:27.987
you will be trapped in Trolla.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.354
I'll take that chance.

06:29.561 --> 06:31.290
Orko may need help.

06:33.331 --> 06:35.561
Very well. Take this,

06:37.435 --> 06:39.164
it is the Sphere of Size.

06:39.571 --> 06:41.368
Squeeze it to grow small.

06:42.974 --> 06:45.875
Release it to return to full size.

06:46.511 --> 06:48.979
Good,
we can enter the portal now.

06:49.181 --> 06:53.049
Remember,
you must be back here by moonrise.

06:53.251 --> 06:54.946
Got it.  Come on.

07:04.729 --> 07:06.060
That's strange.

07:06.231 --> 07:09.758
Going through the portal
changed us back into Adam and Cringer.

07:14.606 --> 07:16.267
Look at this place.

07:16.641 --> 07:18.871
Wow. Upside down trees.

07:21.112 --> 07:23.171
Fish that fly like birds.

07:23.381 --> 07:25.406
Even the rainbow is upside down.

07:25.851 --> 07:27.819
Things seem to be backwards here.

07:30.689 --> 07:32.281
L-L-Look out!

07:34.392 --> 07:36.883
By the power of Grayskull.

07:39.364 --> 07:40.797
It doesn't work here.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.597
Use your fire-ray.

07:50.642 --> 07:53.736
Water!
Oh, something is wrong with this thing?

07:54.112 --> 07:57.639
This calls for drastic measures.

07:58.049 --> 07:59.846
Help, help.

08:01.253 --> 08:03.153
Maybe I can use those trees.

08:16.334 --> 08:18.564
It worked!  Cringer, c'mon.

08:18.770 --> 08:21.705
The sooner we find Orko and
get back to Eternia, the better.

08:22.407 --> 08:25.035
At last, a voice of reason.

08:27.545 --> 08:29.911
Did we lose Dragoon?

08:30.081 --> 08:31.548
Uh... I'll look.

08:34.986 --> 08:36.214
I don't see him.

08:36.922 --> 08:40.187
I don't remember Dragoon.
Where did he come from?

08:40.592 --> 08:43.857
They say he was sent here by
a creature called Skeletor.

08:44.396 --> 08:46.330
Skeletor, I might have known.

08:47.265 --> 08:51.031
You two will not escape...

08:51.236 --> 08:53.204
me this time.

08:54.839 --> 08:55.931
-Help! -Help!

08:55.974 --> 08:57.066
Help!

08:58.643 --> 09:00.008
-Help! -Help!

09:00.145 --> 09:01.407
That's coming from the gorge.

09:02.614 --> 09:04.138
-Help! -Help!

09:04.149 --> 09:06.413
It's Orko, he's in trouble. Over this way.

09:09.487 --> 09:11.853
I got a nice surprise...

09:12.057 --> 09:15.424
waiting for you two at my fortress.

09:17.462 --> 09:20.294
They're trapped, in a ring of fire.

09:24.703 --> 09:26.193
-Help! -Help!

09:26.271 --> 09:27.533
We've got to do something.

09:28.073 --> 09:30.940
Help, let me go.
My fire-ray...

09:31.643 --> 09:33.235
Help!

09:33.478 --> 09:34.775
Help!

09:34.980 --> 09:36.311
It shoots water here.

09:38.183 --> 09:39.946
Orko, up here.

09:40.151 --> 09:41.311
Adam, where are y...

09:41.486 --> 09:42.145
Look out!

09:51.830 --> 09:55.197
Orko.
Your powers really are strong here.

09:56.034 --> 09:58.195
Very well, trollan...

09:58.403 --> 10:01.497
I'll return for you later.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.039
He's got Dree Elle.

10:07.245 --> 10:10.214
What happened?
Why aren't you He-Man?

10:10.382 --> 10:11.974
That's a long story.

10:12.150 --> 10:14.641
Let's go after Dree Elle
and I'll tell you on the way...

10:15.220 --> 10:17.916
and let's be quick about it,
we only have a few hours left.

10:21.626 --> 10:23.526
Help! Save me!

10:24.095 --> 10:25.357
Silence.

10:26.164 --> 10:29.827
Your friends await their fate.

10:30.635 --> 10:32.933
Orko the Great will cut you down to size.

10:33.972 --> 10:36.668
Such spirit pretty one.

10:37.909 --> 10:41.367
I will put your energy to good use.

10:41.579 --> 10:43.513
What are you doing to my people?

10:43.681 --> 10:46.548
You're about to find out.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.184
You can't change into He-Man here?

10:51.356 --> 10:54.416
No, there is something about Trolla...

10:54.592 --> 10:56.081
Something I'm overlooking.

10:56.106 --> 10:57.881
I can't put my finger on it.

10:58.096 --> 11:02.157
You're sure it's not dark in Eternia, yet?

11:02.333 --> 11:03.857
Yes, we still have two hours.

11:04.269 --> 11:06.430
There. Dragoon's fortress.

11:06.604 --> 11:07.969
Let's find a way inside.

11:08.706 --> 11:10.169
What's wrong with them?

11:10.194 --> 11:11.528
What have you done?

11:12.243 --> 11:15.701
I'm draining their energy from them.

11:17.182 --> 11:20.481
I am so tired. Oh.

11:23.154 --> 11:26.055
Sleep, trollan, sleep.

11:26.224 --> 11:30.251
The energy is stored
there, in the Megacore.

11:31.096 --> 11:33.826
When I have collected the
energy of all your people...

11:34.032 --> 11:36.398
My mission will be complete.

11:37.135 --> 11:40.798
The energy will be
transferred to my master...

11:41.206 --> 11:42.673
Skeletor.

11:45.877 --> 11:47.902
Another one done.

11:52.584 --> 11:55.451
Now, it's your turn.

11:55.653 --> 11:59.919
No, stop.
You can't do this, you...

12:00.291 --> 12:03.385
I see you have strong energy.

12:03.661 --> 12:04.753
You won't get

12:05.130 --> 12:07.098
away with...

12:07.432 --> 12:08.399
I...

12:08.600 --> 12:09.862
I can't...

12:10.068 --> 12:11.330
think...

12:14.305 --> 12:17.900
Farewell, pretty one.

12:19.244 --> 12:20.541
Must not...

12:20.945 --> 12:23.939
go... to... sleep.

12:26.284 --> 12:27.876
C'mon, inside.

12:29.187 --> 12:31.553
I better keep watch out here.

12:31.823 --> 12:32.721
Cringer.

12:32.957 --> 12:34.515
All right, all right.

12:34.726 --> 12:37.194
At least there's nothing
guarding this place.

12:44.802 --> 12:47.498
I've had about enough of this world;

12:48.139 --> 12:52.303
crazy beasts, upside down trees,

12:52.443 --> 12:54.502
fire-rays that shoot water.

12:55.146 --> 12:57.381
Even Orko's magic works!

12:57.406 --> 13:00.198
Everything's backwards here.

13:00.919 --> 13:02.147
That's it!

13:04.055 --> 13:06.649
Things are backwards here. If I say

13:06.858 --> 13:09.986
'By the power of Grayskull' backwards...

13:10.161 --> 13:12.686
Maybe then, it will work.

13:13.097 --> 13:16.294
Grayskull of power the by!

13:21.806 --> 13:26.209
I have the power!

13:45.263 --> 13:46.491
Here you are.

13:48.132 --> 13:49.963
Hungry, huh?

13:50.134 --> 13:51.624
Well, dig in.

13:54.439 --> 13:56.634
Who goes there?

13:57.108 --> 14:00.009
I'll take care of Dragoon.
You look for Dree Elle.

14:00.245 --> 14:03.737
Come out and play with me, frog face.

14:05.116 --> 14:07.050
Orko, go!

14:11.956 --> 14:15.551
No one defies me.

14:16.194 --> 14:18.253
Dree Elle, where are you?

14:21.898 --> 14:25.197
Dree Elle.
What has he...

14:25.360 --> 14:26.360
done to you?

14:37.815 --> 14:39.063
Just as I thought.

14:39.088 --> 14:42.139
Only one man in the universe has that kind

14:42.287 --> 14:43.447
of strength.

14:46.758 --> 14:49.124
Skeletor warned me about you.

14:49.294 --> 14:51.228
Imagine his pleasure

14:51.462 --> 14:53.269
when he learns that I have

14:53.294 --> 14:55.445
banished you to...

14:56.091 --> 14:58.691
the bottomless hole of Trolla!

15:06.678 --> 15:08.791
This hole never ends.

15:08.816 --> 15:11.230
You will fall forever!

15:26.064 --> 15:28.658
It's time for your fall, He-Man.

15:28.833 --> 15:31.495
A fall forever.

15:36.007 --> 15:37.872
Help!

15:38.843 --> 15:40.640
Help mee!

15:41.846 --> 15:43.279
Stand by, Battle Cat.

15:49.253 --> 15:51.380
Battle Cat, find another vine.

16:02.533 --> 16:04.057
Hang on, Cat.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.442
Now comes the hard part.

16:32.964 --> 16:35.057
I don't understand.

16:35.233 --> 16:38.691
You risked your life to save me?

16:39.237 --> 16:42.365
I wouldn't have done that for you.

16:42.573 --> 16:45.736
That's how we're different:
I believe in saving lives.

16:45.977 --> 16:47.968
Even your enemies?

16:48.179 --> 16:51.012
I may be your enemy, but you're not mine.

16:51.382 --> 16:54.317
Maybe I've been wrong.

16:54.652 --> 16:57.678
Maybe saving lives is better...

16:57.822 --> 16:59.722
You got some heavy thinking to do.

16:59.891 --> 17:01.722
I hope you come to the right conclusion.

17:01.993 --> 17:02.983
But if I hear you've

17:03.008 --> 17:04.541
returned to your evil ways,

17:05.163 --> 17:06.323
I'll be back.

17:07.365 --> 17:08.423
He-Man...

17:10.568 --> 17:12.160
thank you.

17:16.641 --> 17:17.767
Orko, what's wrong?

17:18.342 --> 17:21.402
It's Dree Elle.
I can't wake her up.

17:24.348 --> 17:25.940
Have you tried your magic?

17:26.117 --> 17:27.175
Didn't work.

17:27.351 --> 17:28.875
You can't give up. You are

17:29.020 --> 17:31.648
the greatest sorcerer in all of Trolla.

17:32.623 --> 17:35.353
That's right. We believe in you...

17:35.526 --> 17:37.187
but you have to believe in yourself.

17:37.395 --> 17:40.489
Keep trying. No matter what.

17:43.501 --> 17:44.525
I wish...

17:45.403 --> 17:47.667
with all my heart from way...

17:48.339 --> 17:50.170
down deep Dree Elle...

17:50.508 --> 17:52.271
please rise...

17:52.410 --> 17:53.944
from Dragoon's sleep.

17:56.180 --> 17:58.148
Please, work.

18:01.352 --> 18:02.319
What's it?

18:02.553 --> 18:03.611
Dree Elle!

18:06.524 --> 18:09.687
What's he doing?
We only have a few minutes left.

18:09.894 --> 18:12.454
He had to revive all the other trollans,

18:12.663 --> 18:15.530
and I think he wanted to
show Dree Elle his face.

18:16.534 --> 18:18.297
It is a custom among the trollans.

18:18.503 --> 18:21.495
You only show your face
to someone you love.

18:22.273 --> 18:23.297
Kinda like...

18:23.541 --> 18:25.509
Well, it's like getting engaged.

18:26.611 --> 18:28.306
Give me a break.

18:29.814 --> 18:32.681
Orko, you did it, you saved us all.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.909
Well, I better be going.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.582
Can't you stay here, with us?

18:38.856 --> 18:42.792
Oh, I wish I could,
but my friends in Eternia need me.

18:42.994 --> 18:45.462
There's still so much evil to fight there.

18:46.063 --> 18:47.724
I understand.

18:48.165 --> 18:51.100
Dree Elle,
do you think, before I leave...

18:51.269 --> 18:54.932
we could really see each other? Show faces?

18:55.773 --> 18:58.867
Oh Orko, I was hoping you'd ask.

19:06.751 --> 19:10.517
Ah, you're, beautiful.
I'll be back someday.

19:10.988 --> 19:12.421
I'll be waiting.

19:20.765 --> 19:23.325
Hurry, Moonrise is starting right now.

19:23.634 --> 19:25.397
We'll never make it in time.

19:25.570 --> 19:26.696
We've got to.

19:28.706 --> 19:33.109
The moon, has risen. It's too late.
The portal's disappearing.

19:34.645 --> 19:36.010
I'm afraid they've...

19:37.081 --> 19:38.105
Look!

19:41.218 --> 19:44.119
Well, I guess this means we've
been eating our vegetables.

19:44.455 --> 19:46.013
Welcome back, He-Man.

19:46.223 --> 19:48.521
Good to see you, lad. What happened?

19:50.428 --> 19:52.555
Orko's magic saved his people.

19:52.763 --> 19:54.697
-Really?
You should have seen him.

19:54.865 --> 19:55.925
I could never have done it

19:55.950 --> 19:57.050
without your faith in me.

19:57.234 --> 19:58.098
Orko...

19:58.269 --> 20:00.169
why didn't you stay with Dree Elle?

20:00.338 --> 20:02.533
You seemed so fond of each other.

20:02.773 --> 20:05.173
I wanted to, but you're my friends too...

20:05.443 --> 20:07.599
and as long as the Skeletor threatens

20:07.624 --> 20:09.836
Eternia, I'm gonna help you defend it.

20:09.947 --> 20:13.178
Well, little guy, I'm glad you're back.
We need you,

20:13.517 --> 20:16.782
and by the way, you're one fine magician...

20:16.988 --> 20:19.438
and don't let anyone tell you

20:19.463 --> 20:21.574
otherwise, not even me.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.149
In today's story Orko was faced

20:31.174 --> 20:32.821
with a very difficult decision.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.504
You know, when we're young most

20:34.529 --> 20:36.259
of our decisions are made for us.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.957
But as we get older, well, we want to

20:37.982 --> 20:39.634
make more and more of them for ourselves.

20:39.644 --> 20:41.104
And that's they way it ought to be.

20:41.112 --> 20:42.909
But sometimes we have a real tough one,

20:43.280 --> 20:44.440
a real problem.

20:44.615 --> 20:46.192
And when that happens it's a good idea

20:46.217 --> 20:47.631
to talk it over with someone else.

20:47.818 --> 20:49.809
Someone who really cares about you.

20:50.021 --> 20:51.479
Like your mother or father,

20:51.504 --> 20:53.014
or maybe your best friend.

20:53.190 --> 20:54.655
Talking a problem out with

20:54.680 --> 20:56.650
someone else can be a great help.
