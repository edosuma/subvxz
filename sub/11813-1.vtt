58:13.339 --> 58:15.933
...a wonderful topic of conversation,
you know?

58:16.009 --> 58:18.705
But then, everything just moved so fast.

58:18.811 --> 58:20.210
It became too late.

58:23.216 --> 58:25.343
Sometimes I'm sure she's gonna leave me.

58:27.954 --> 58:29.046
Really?

58:30.356 --> 58:32.153
Does she still have her hair?

58:33.893 --> 58:35.383
Her hair?

58:35.495 --> 58:38.623
Yeah, that was the part that, like...

58:38.698 --> 58:40.825
- really bugged me about my mom.
- Oh, her hair.

58:40.900 --> 58:42.993
Yeah, she has her hair still, so...

58:44.304 --> 58:47.034
- Great.
- Yeah. Thanks for asking.

58:50.176 --> 58:52.144
Oh, my God.

59:00.587 --> 59:01.713
What?

59:01.821 --> 59:03.186
I was...

59:04.190 --> 59:06.590
...clearing out the last
of my mom's stuff the other day

59:06.693 --> 59:08.422
and I didn't realize that I...

59:09.562 --> 59:11.894
Wait, did we just have sex
with your mother's condoms?

59:11.998 --> 59:14.091
We might have done that. I think we did.

59:14.200 --> 59:15.758
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God.

59:15.868 --> 59:17.563
What-- Could you check the date?

59:18.104 --> 59:20.038
- Jonah?
- I'm sorry.

59:20.106 --> 59:21.596
Oh, my God.

59:23.910 --> 59:25.844
Yeah, she was this lively person.

59:25.912 --> 59:27.675
She was not this depressed...

59:27.747 --> 59:29.442
I know, you talked about her
all the time.

59:30.450 --> 59:31.747
Really?

59:33.553 --> 59:34.952
Did she live up to it?

59:35.688 --> 59:36.746
Yeah.

59:42.061 --> 59:43.289
Yeah.

59:45.231 --> 59:46.357
But...

59:48.234 --> 59:49.792
No buts, I...

59:51.237 --> 59:53.137
You know, I didn't
expect her to be so...

59:54.440 --> 59:55.634
...fragile.

59:58.278 --> 59:59.472
Fragile?

01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:02.112
Yeah.

01:00:02.215 --> 01:00:03.614
I don't know. That's not the right word.

01:00:03.716 --> 01:00:05.980
- She was--
- No. No, it's just interesting.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.756
Would you have said that if you didn't
know what happened to her later?

01:00:15.728 --> 01:00:18.253
- No, probably not.
- Right.

01:00:36.916 --> 01:00:38.247
Oh, shit.

01:01:28.201 --> 01:01:29.532
You're lucky.

01:01:31.037 --> 01:01:32.800
I am? Why am I lucky?

01:01:35.808 --> 01:01:38.333
[woman on PA mumbling]

01:01:41.314 --> 01:01:42.713
No, that's not me.

01:01:42.815 --> 01:01:46.808
Because you've got everything
you want in one place.

01:01:47.987 --> 01:01:49.352
Except you.

01:01:54.761 --> 01:01:56.251
Except me.

01:02:01.234 --> 01:02:03.600
I've had this feeling lately. I...

01:02:04.036 --> 01:02:06.095
I can't really explain it, but...

01:02:08.674 --> 01:02:10.039
I feel that...

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:12.907
...every time you go away,

01:02:13.012 --> 01:02:15.344
I half expect that you're
not gonna come back.

01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:21.184
I understand. It's normal.

01:02:21.754 --> 01:02:22.880
Is it?

01:02:29.295 --> 01:02:32.458
After this, I slow down. I promise.

01:02:55.922 --> 01:03:00.382
If it wasn't for you,
I would have stopped a long time ago.

01:03:01.794 --> 01:03:03.659
You know most
of the other people I work with

01:03:03.763 --> 01:03:06.493
don't have anything
to go back to like I have.

01:03:06.599 --> 01:03:07.725
They...

01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:12.462
They're like addicts.
As soon as they go home...

01:03:12.572 --> 01:03:14.836
- Aren't you like that?
- ...they want to leave again.

01:03:17.743 --> 01:03:18.937
Aren't you like that?

01:03:19.612 --> 01:03:21.409
No, not at all.

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:26.580
I don't want to be the one
to tell you to stop.

01:03:29.388 --> 01:03:31.754
I stopped. I gave up acting.

01:03:31.824 --> 01:03:33.291
I never asked you to give it up.

01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:35.418
I know, I know you didn't.
I know you didn't.

01:03:35.495 --> 01:03:38.464
Do you hear what you're saying?
You hear how selfish that is?

01:03:38.531 --> 01:03:42.092
No, it's our life.
It's our family's life.

01:03:42.168 --> 01:03:44.102
- Me and those two--
- I thank you, I thank you.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.263
When they call me
and they told me that you were hurt,

01:03:46.339 --> 01:03:49.502
you know the first thing I thought?
About the kids, not about you.

01:03:50.176 --> 01:03:53.475
Because that's what I've
been expecting for years.

01:03:54.614 --> 01:03:55.945
And there it is.

01:04:08.027 --> 01:04:11.155
"Afghan Refugees Camps
Struggle in Search of Aid."

01:04:12.865 --> 01:04:14.196
It's great.

01:04:35.254 --> 01:04:37.552
Anyway, thanks for taking me today.

01:04:38.424 --> 01:04:40.722
You're welcome. I wanted to.

01:04:50.169 --> 01:04:52.535
I know I said
I wouldn't do this anymore.

01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:00.001
After this, I'll slow down. I promise.

01:05:40.653 --> 01:05:42.621
[groans]

01:05:42.722 --> 01:05:44.656
I can't believe they still do this shit.

01:05:44.757 --> 01:05:46.554
- They're really good.
- Oh, yeah?

01:05:46.626 --> 01:05:50.084
Yeah, they got second place in,
like, some competition.

01:05:51.964 --> 01:05:53.397
That's amazing.

01:05:55.968 --> 01:05:57.663
- There.
- Which one?

01:05:58.070 --> 01:05:59.401
Gray hoodie.

01:06:01.574 --> 01:06:03.007
What happened to her arm?

01:06:04.744 --> 01:06:07.178
Man, she'll miss the game on Friday.

01:06:07.279 --> 01:06:08.268
She--

01:06:08.347 --> 01:06:09.507
- [phone ringing]
- Shit.

01:06:11.984 --> 01:06:14.418
- Hey, sorry.
- [Amy] Where are you? Are you okay?

01:06:14.487 --> 01:06:15.852
[Jonah] Yeah. No, no. I'm actually...

01:06:15.955 --> 01:06:17.752
I'm still here.
Did you not get my message?

01:06:17.823 --> 01:06:19.757
[Amy] No. What's happening?

01:06:20.526 --> 01:06:23.188
Yeah, no, no.
It's just been crazy up here.

01:06:24.864 --> 01:06:25.853
Yeah, no. I kept thinking I would

01:06:25.965 --> 01:06:27.694
actually make it
back and then I'm actually...

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.167
I'm in the middle of a meeting
with a gallery right now.

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:32.669
Yeah, there was kind of a mix up.

01:06:32.772 --> 01:06:34.296
I really need to talk to you.

01:06:34.373 --> 01:06:37.035
Yeah, I will Skype you as soon as I get
back to the house though, okay?

01:06:37.677 --> 01:06:38.974
- Yeah.
- What was that?

01:06:39.045 --> 01:06:40.945
No, I don't...
What? I don't know.

01:06:41.013 --> 01:06:42.640
No, I don't know what that was. But...

01:06:42.715 --> 01:06:45.775
I miss you and... yeah, I gotta go.

01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:48.046
- Okay, call me.
- Bye.

01:06:52.358 --> 01:06:55.691
You know, if I had a girl,
I'd never lie to her.

01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:58.059
Yeah? Good luck with that.

01:07:00.866 --> 01:07:02.231
I'm gonna give it to her.

01:07:02.334 --> 01:07:05.394
- What?
- You know, the stuff you read.

01:07:06.405 --> 01:07:08.999
To her? Are you serious?

01:07:09.408 --> 01:07:11.137
Yeah. I want her to know me.

01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:18.845
Okay, listen.

01:07:19.652 --> 01:07:23.349
I thought you were kind of, like,
backwards and really weird...

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:26.381
...but it turns out you're not.

01:07:26.826 --> 01:07:29.226
You're... I mean,
you're actually pretty cool.

01:07:29.328 --> 01:07:33.924
And that stuff you wrote,
really, that stuff was...

01:07:34.433 --> 01:07:35.661
It was excellent.

01:07:37.336 --> 01:07:40.032
Still... and I'm telling you this
because I love you,

01:07:40.106 --> 01:07:43.166
that girl is never gonna
go for you, no way.

01:07:43.242 --> 01:07:45.403
I'm sorry. She's just not.

01:07:45.511 --> 01:07:48.344
It's not your fault. I mean,
it's not her fault either.

01:07:48.414 --> 01:07:51.110
It's high school.
And, like, the hierarchy here,

01:07:51.217 --> 01:07:54.550
the status of looks
and social skills and all this bullshit

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.918
is stricter here than
anywhere else in the world.

01:07:57.022 --> 01:07:59.684
And that's why you should never
give those notes to that girl.

01:07:59.759 --> 01:08:01.750
I mean, look at her.
She's not gonna get it.

01:08:01.861 --> 01:08:04.091
Look at her friends.
They're gonna laugh at you.

01:08:06.198 --> 01:08:09.964
I mean, they'd be wrong, because you are
way cooler than they will ever be.

01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:11.536
You really are.

01:08:11.604 --> 01:08:13.196
But... but they'll destroy you.

01:08:16.242 --> 01:08:18.733
Just lay low for a few years.

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:21.245
Sit it out, okay? It gets better.

01:08:23.381 --> 01:08:24.712
Do you understand me?

01:08:26.919 --> 01:08:28.045
Okay.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:21.701
[teacher] Time's up.

01:09:46.398 --> 01:09:48.559
This looks right. Just fill it back in.

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:49.827
No.

01:09:49.902 --> 01:09:51.493
Why did you erase it?

01:09:53.171 --> 01:09:55.299
It's okay. Just fill it back in
while I collect the others.

01:09:55.374 --> 01:09:56.398
No!

01:09:57.409 --> 01:09:58.671
That's not fair.

01:09:58.744 --> 01:10:01.474
[students snickering]

01:10:01.547 --> 01:10:03.742
Stop joking around. Just do as I say.

01:10:06.986 --> 01:10:08.214
Sit down!

01:10:12.558 --> 01:10:14.048
Sit down!

01:10:42.888 --> 01:10:45.789
I must admit, I'm a bit lost here.

01:10:46.225 --> 01:10:48.716
- Me too.
- And, Conrad...

01:10:50.896 --> 01:10:52.761
You still have nothing
to stay for yourself?

01:10:56.268 --> 01:10:58.634
You know, I don't think
this will happen again.

01:11:12.584 --> 01:11:15.883
Listen... I'm not gonna see her again.

01:11:17.823 --> 01:11:19.154
I know I fucked up.

01:11:22.061 --> 01:11:24.325
I don't always do the right thing,

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:27.456
and I end up making these
really stupid mistakes, I'm sorry.

01:11:32.471 --> 01:11:35.599
Is it-- Is it difficult
for you to talk to me?

01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:41.438
I mean, we don't always
have to agree about everything,

01:11:41.513 --> 01:11:43.003
but I think it's really important

01:11:43.115 --> 01:11:46.278
that you and I are
able to talk to each other.

01:11:51.156 --> 01:11:55.855
You remember when... when you were
a kid and we used to just--

01:11:55.961 --> 01:11:56.950
Please...

01:12:17.683 --> 01:12:19.651
[chattering]
[horns honking]

01:12:52.217 --> 01:12:56.085
Wow!
It's beautiful!

01:12:59.391 --> 01:13:01.757
When did you do this drawing? Today?

01:13:03.062 --> 01:13:05.053
No? Before I came back.

01:13:06.398 --> 01:13:08.662
Look at this. Isn't it pretty?

01:13:10.736 --> 01:13:15.264
Floating in the desert.
But you are very talented, Conrad.

01:13:15.374 --> 01:13:16.671
Very talented.

01:13:21.013 --> 01:13:23.004
I missed you so, you know?

01:13:24.016 --> 01:13:25.244
Yeah.

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:27.580
I'm so happy to be back.

01:13:39.465 --> 01:13:42.093
[printer whirring]

01:14:00.052 --> 01:14:01.041
Yeah?

01:14:03.589 --> 01:14:05.489
Could you give this to Melanie, please?

01:14:07.392 --> 01:14:08.825
Melanie, it's for you!

01:14:08.927 --> 01:14:10.986
- [Melanie] Who is it?
- It's a friend of yours.

01:14:11.997 --> 01:14:13.726
Hold on, I'll be there in a minute.

01:15:00.679 --> 01:15:02.044
[knocks softly]

01:16:03.842 --> 01:16:05.173
Thanks.

01:16:05.244 --> 01:16:08.543
I'd rather you went through it
than those agency people.

01:16:13.885 --> 01:16:15.113
[Richard]
Do you take anything with it?

01:16:16.588 --> 01:16:17.782
Black.

01:16:19.791 --> 01:16:23.454
Sameena's moved to Jackson Heights.
With the kids.

01:16:24.263 --> 01:16:26.424
And she has gone back to school.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.500
She wants to be an architect at 45.

01:16:33.872 --> 01:16:35.840
Oh, well, it's all good.

01:16:43.815 --> 01:16:47.012
Look, I don't know
how to say this, but I've...

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:54.090
Did you have an affair with Isabelle?

01:17:00.599 --> 01:17:01.896
Yeah.

01:17:03.302 --> 01:17:04.997
Yes. Yes, I did.

01:17:05.804 --> 01:17:07.237
Did it go on for long?

01:17:07.906 --> 01:17:08.998
A while.

01:17:10.175 --> 01:17:11.472
On and off.

01:17:14.112 --> 01:17:15.773
But it was never here.

01:17:15.847 --> 01:17:18.338
It was never stateside.
It wasn't like...

01:17:23.488 --> 01:17:25.183
I wanted to be with her, Gene.

01:17:26.825 --> 01:17:28.918
I was ready to leave Sameena
and everything.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:33.031
But for her, it only made sense
when we were working.

01:17:33.131 --> 01:17:35.622
So when she stopped going...

01:17:37.836 --> 01:17:39.098
...that was it.

01:17:41.773 --> 01:17:44.298
She wanted to be with you and the boys.

01:17:44.976 --> 01:17:46.136
Yeah.

01:17:46.878 --> 01:17:48.539
She wanted to make that work.

01:17:48.647 --> 01:17:50.171
I never believed her.

[Gene] I was so...

01:18:09.201 --> 01:18:10.691
I was just so angry.

01:18:14.172 --> 01:18:16.538
I had this feeling all the time that...

01:18:17.676 --> 01:18:19.803
...you know,
that one day she was just...

01:18:20.345 --> 01:18:24.714

get up and leave again.

One morning, you're over there

01:18:38.263 --> 01:18:40.356
doing something you feel is important...

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:43.965
But it's hard as well, you know.

01:18:45.036 --> 01:18:47.061
You can't wait to go back home.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.601
Then finally, you're here.

01:18:51.576 --> 01:18:53.874
You always arrive exhausted...

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.408
...having changed planes,
like, four times.

01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:05.180
You follow your convictions,
your dreams,

01:19:05.257 --> 01:19:09.125
your passions, and then all of a sudden,
one day, that's your life.

01:19:09.628 --> 01:19:13.291
And you are split,
just right down the middle.

01:19:14.699 --> 01:19:17.998
Yeah, but you don't have to,
you have a choice.

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.301
Yes.

01:19:21.573 --> 01:19:25.771
But you can't plan for what happens
after you make that choice.

01:19:27.646 --> 01:19:32.174
One morning, you find yourself
somewhere in the world,

01:19:32.284 --> 01:19:34.548
doing what you believe in,
what you feel is important,

01:19:34.619 --> 01:19:36.348
and it is frustrating as hell,

01:19:36.455 --> 01:19:39.083
because you cannot wait
to get back home again.

01:19:40.392 --> 01:19:42.087
And then you are home and...

01:19:43.428 --> 01:19:45.225
...and you're exhausted, you've...

01:19:45.297 --> 01:19:47.424
And it's been a day and a half...

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.496
Getting home,
changing planes four, five times,

01:19:51.603 --> 01:19:54.436

is get some rest, so...

They don't know how much they have
changed since last time you saw them.

Thank you for the luggage.

which they didn't like before and...

01:20:35.514 --> 01:20:38.381
[Isabelle] After a few days,
you feel better in the role.

01:20:39.484 --> 01:20:41.850
No, it's not even a role.

More than anything.

you're in the way.

01:21:06.778 --> 01:21:09.144
In the way of what they usually do.

01:21:11.216 --> 01:21:13.946
Again, you get the feeling
you are in the wrong place.

01:21:22.494 --> 01:21:24.655
It's not that they don't want you there.

01:21:25.263 --> 01:21:26.560
