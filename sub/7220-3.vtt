WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:03.614
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.877
You're going around offering
large amounts of cash

00:05.973 --> 00:07.509
for properties sight unseen.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.985
Some folks
are under the impression

00:09.042 --> 00:10.783
you boys are here
just to sell pizzas.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.051
You know, I haven't been in this
building since I was a kid.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.285
Mmm.
Used to be a bank.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.886
I just figured you might
want to go at Boyd directly.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.362
No. I want to keep building a
RICO case like we've been doing.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.025
Besides, we don't have to go
at him directly. We got Ava.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.501
'Cause she was so helpful getting
us ahead of the bank robbery.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.005
I found these. Thought they might
be from that bank robbery.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.621
These docs,
were they difficult to find?

00:29.630 --> 00:30.904
You think he set me up?

00:30.998 --> 00:32.841
You think he's got
any reason to suspect you?

00:32.966 --> 00:35.503
I wouldn't have thought so 30 seconds ago.
Just put them back.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.476
You were supposed to find out
where Calhoun's keeping

00:38.539 --> 00:40.075
his cash and steal it,

00:40.173 --> 00:41.550
not raid his filing cabinet.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.848
You check his office
for a secret safe?

00:42.910 --> 00:44.389
'Course.
And his home?

00:44.478 --> 00:45.548
And his mama's home.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.818
The money is there.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.190
You just have to try
a little harder, Boyd.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.728
I know you robbed that bank,

00:50.817 --> 00:52.524
and I know you didn't get
what you wanted.

00:52.586 --> 00:53.860
Just a bunch of land deeds.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.868
One of those deeds
was to Pizza Portal.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.494
My baby girl.
Oh, you're a genius!

01:04.598 --> 01:06.544
"Oh, shit.
You're Boyd's girl."

01:07.868 --> 01:11.179
Like I come in wearing your varsity
letter jacket or something.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.842
Well, maybe you should have.

01:12.940 --> 01:16.581
I don't remember you
ever having a letterman jacket.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.453
Oh, yeah. That's right.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.424
Yeah, I always meant to
get me one of those. Oh.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.258
That's the thing about having
a drug dealer for a daddy.

01:25.852 --> 01:28.264
I never could make it
to practice on time.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.235
Well, I must confess, darlin'.

01:35.062 --> 01:38.100
I thought you would
have tapped out

01:38.198 --> 01:40.371
of this particular bacchanal
long before now.

01:40.534 --> 01:41.706
Huh?

01:41.802 --> 01:44.442
I didn't still think you had this
kind of drinking in you, girl.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.312
You disappointed?

01:46.406 --> 01:50.218
Oh, on the contrary.
I ain't disappointed.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.882
Mmm-hmm.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.792
Mmm-hmm.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.460
Oh.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.121
Are you gonna pop
on me, darlin'?

01:59.252 --> 02:00.253
Uh-uh.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.230
You need me to hold your hair back?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.927
Huh?
No.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.726
I ain't puked up bourbon

02:05.792 --> 02:07.271
since I wore
a cheerleader skirt.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.466
I don't aim to start again now.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.273
Mmm.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.278
Well, I remember thinking

02:14.334 --> 02:16.245
what I wouldn't give

02:16.303 --> 02:17.805
to be a stripe

02:17.904 --> 02:19.508
on that cheerleader skirt.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.762
Oh.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.936
A little early in
the morning to be getting

02:47.000 --> 02:48.604
text messages, ain't it?

02:48.969 --> 02:50.539
Oh, are you
a little bit jealous?

02:50.771 --> 02:53.513
Well, I wouldn't think so.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.218
But now that you mention it...

02:56.543 --> 02:59.956
I'll tell you who it's from if
you promise not to get angry.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.857
Well, my experience,

03:01.948 --> 03:04.724
promises of that nature
tend to be hollow.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.728
But I promise to try my best.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.529
Mmm-hmm.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.968
Pearl called in sick
from the salon.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.298
Ah.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.000
Looks like I got to open.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.644
After drinking whiskey
for six hours.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.179
Damn, woman.

03:21.234 --> 03:24.340
You the last person
I want cutting my hair.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.678
You might be surprised

03:27.140 --> 03:29.711
what I can do
on a little bourbon buzz.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.726
Well, I will promise
to hold that thought

04:08.048 --> 04:10.028
Something funny?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.085
Oh, it's all funny, Raylan.

04:12.185 --> 04:15.257
Funny you sending me
texts with the sunrise,

04:15.355 --> 04:19.632
funny me having to hide them
from my man like a secret agent.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.233
Your man, meaning Boyd?

04:22.462 --> 04:24.135
Something about you
this morning,

04:24.231 --> 04:25.574
hard to put a finger on.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.972
Well, I'm shitfaced,
so there's that.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.696
Ava, it's 7:00
in the morning.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.243
See?

04:33.206 --> 04:36.119
I had plenty of time
to work up to it.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.653
You get any sleep at all?

04:38.044 --> 04:40.456
Been doing what I was appointed.

04:41.047 --> 04:44.119
So, you were up all night
drinking with Boyd.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.218
Uh-huh.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.063
All night, Raylan.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.125
You gonna give me
a daddy lecture,

04:50.223 --> 04:52.396
tell me to keep it
'tween the ditches?

04:52.559 --> 04:53.765
I'll tell you what.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.731
I ain't in any kind
of mood to hear it.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.467
Hangover's already kicked in.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.603
I got elephants marching
around in my skull,

05:01.668 --> 05:04.080
and they're only gonna get
angrier as the clay wears on.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.781
So, how about

05:06.139 --> 05:09.985
we get to whatever it is
you summoned me here for

05:11.244 --> 05:14.316
so I can get back
and nurse my affliction.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.293
What? What is so funny?

05:17.984 --> 05:22.023
Ava, you picked the wrong morning
to show up half in the bag.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.757
Good morning, Ms. Crowder.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.770
Hope we didn't pull you away
from anything too pressing.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.272
Ah, shit.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.998
And this is a writ.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.535
It is outlining the terms

05:33.667 --> 05:35.169
of your confidential
informant arrangement

05:35.268 --> 05:36.474
with the US Attorney's office

05:36.636 --> 05:38.343
where you stipulate
that you will

05:38.471 --> 05:40.041
obtain and relay

05:40.473 --> 05:43.545
relevant information that may lead
to charges against Boyd Crowder.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.685
I know what all it says.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.487
I haven't forgotten
what our arrangement is.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.218
Well, I'm really
happy to hear that because

05:50.317 --> 05:51.557
up until now, I'm having
a really hard time

05:51.685 --> 05:54.165
seeing how you're holding up

05:54.221 --> 05:55.564
to your side of the bargain.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.762
It's kind of been
a dry well, Ms. Crowder.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.098
You need to give us something
makes us lean forward.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.639
Otherwise, what are we doing?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.968
I told you I am working on it.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.132
And we heard you.
Our point is...

06:06.233 --> 06:07.712
Point is that
you can throw a stone

06:07.801 --> 06:09.474
into any one of these
shit-packed hollers

06:09.569 --> 06:12.049
and hit some random hillbilly
with more information

06:12.138 --> 06:13.515
than you've been able to
dredge up so far.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.984
I just need time.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.979
I barely been out a couple of weeks.
How am I supp...

06:18.311 --> 06:20.689
"Weeks" is the relevant word
in that sentence, Ms. Crowder.

06:20.747 --> 06:24.160
It has been weeks without
any useful information

06:24.217 --> 06:25.218
from you.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.389
Weeks with crimes
that are happening

06:27.487 --> 06:28.898
that we know little

06:28.989 --> 06:30.764
to nothing about!
Vasquez.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.098
She gets the picture.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.364
Does she?

06:37.864 --> 06:40.105
Look at her. You don't think
you're making an impression?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.279
Ms. Crowder,

06:43.236 --> 06:45.036
I understand you're
feeling under the weather,

06:45.105 --> 06:48.518
and I understand you're
feeling a little picked on,

06:49.009 --> 06:50.682
but you need to understand

06:50.844 --> 06:52.924
if you don't bring us something
relevant and tangible

06:53.013 --> 06:55.584
within the week,
your time as a Cl is done.

06:56.883 --> 07:00.262
You'll be remanded back to prison
to serve out your sentence.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.232
Or die trying, right?

07:07.694 --> 07:11.141
You come all the way
to Harlan to threaten me?

07:11.364 --> 07:13.364
Could have made a phone call,
save yourself a trip.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.446
Ava...
No, Raylan.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.874
I understand.

07:18.905 --> 07:22.876
You ain't getting your way
fast enough to suit you,

07:23.043 --> 07:25.387
so you bring
these two assholes up here

07:25.445 --> 07:28.949
to impress upon me
the severity of my situation.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.387
Well, consider myself impressed.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.266
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.465
I have to throw up.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.401
Hmm.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.671
That's some big brass
balls right there,

08:15.762 --> 08:17.002
put the money in a pizza joint.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.765
Smart is what it is.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.839
Pre-fabricated vault
on the premises.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.107
Use the delivery service, take
the money out with the pizzas.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.646
See,
you don't know that.

08:24.704 --> 08:25.904
Makes sense, though, don't it?

08:26.206 --> 08:29.517
Thirty minutes or less, cash,
and a stuffed-crust pie.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.283
Fact is, we don't know how
Calhoun's getting the money in and out.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.222
Don't even know
it's Calhoun's money.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.554
Man, who the hell
else is it gonna be?

08:35.648 --> 08:37.491
Fact is, we don't know shit.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.530
The more you all talk about
it, the more my head hurts.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.121
Did you get me that
cheeseburger like I asked?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.326
It's on the bar, chief.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.676
Gentlemen, we open
for business today?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.069
Little early for a snort,
ain't it?

08:54.300 --> 08:56.075
Doesn't seem to have
stopped you all.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.477
Yeah, well, it's our bar.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.351
And, uh, who in the hell
are you?

09:00.974 --> 09:02.544
My name's Ty Walker.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.886
And if I've come
at a bad time...

09:04.978 --> 09:07.219
Mr. Walker,
I'm nursing a hangover

09:07.313 --> 09:09.273
as a result of one of the best
evenings I've spent

09:09.315 --> 09:10.658
in a long time.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.492
As such, I don't have
the bandwidth

09:13.553 --> 09:15.191
for casual conversation.

09:15.855 --> 09:18.233
Now, a man doesn't walk into
a bar the way you just did

09:18.324 --> 09:20.395
unless he has something
important to discuss.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.666
So, what say we get to it?

09:23.696 --> 09:25.334
You got Buffalo Trace?

09:25.665 --> 09:26.905
Earl.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.580
I come with no more lofty

09:35.675 --> 09:37.211
an aim than to apprise
you of the situation

09:37.277 --> 09:38.881
in which you find yourself.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.957
Thank you.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.416
Mmm-hmm.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.084
When you robbed that
bank the other day,

09:54.360 --> 09:56.601
that... That was a solid
piece of trade craft.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.307
But I don't come
to blow your skirts up,

10:00.400 --> 10:01.902
what geniuses you all are.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.877
My point is,
somewhere along the way,

10:04.938 --> 10:06.576
you got the idea
you were taking money

10:06.639 --> 10:08.585
from that sad sack Calhoun,

10:08.641 --> 10:10.951
which, frankly,
wouldn't bother me a bit.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.821
But that's not the actual fact.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.326
As it happens, you robbed
the man I work for.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.952
And while my employer is fair

10:18.051 --> 10:19.462
and patient on the whole,

10:19.986 --> 10:23.058
he's no weak sister
nor a man to be trifled with.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.827
Say... Say he functions
at a different level

10:26.926 --> 10:27.966
than maybe you're used to.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.905
I don't know, skippy. We're used
to a whole lot around here.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.132
Carl.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.508
I'm just a weather vane,
Mr. Crowder.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.607
I don't make the wind blow.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.813
I'm saying, you find a way
to counsel patience,

10:41.307 --> 10:43.844
desist coming after
what doesn't belong to you,

10:43.943 --> 10:45.422
and everybody wins...

10:45.912 --> 10:46.982
Town, county, and state.

10:47.747 --> 10:48.987
Now, that being said,

10:49.415 --> 10:51.952
you insist upon the track
thus far set upon,

10:52.318 --> 10:53.956
there will be consequences.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.100
You done?

10:58.691 --> 11:00.534
Damn, son. You like to talk
as much as I do.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.336
Well, Mister...
What was your name?

11:06.266 --> 11:07.472
Walker.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.474
Mr. Walker,

11:10.470 --> 11:12.848
well, maybe I did
the things you think I did,

11:12.939 --> 11:14.384
and maybe I didn't.

11:15.008 --> 11:18.046
Either way, I don't
give a shit about you

11:18.478 --> 11:20.151
or the fella you work for.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.818
Now, many a man
come through that door,

11:22.882 --> 11:24.225
ringing a similar bell.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.854
Most of those men are dead
now in one way or another.

11:27.153 --> 11:30.794
Well, I certainly got no desire to
end up like all those other men.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.736
- As I said...
- Ah, ah.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.998
You're just a weather vane.
I heard you.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.538
Now, you come here,
said what you needed to say,

11:38.631 --> 11:41.305
and interrupted my repast
in the process.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.542
Now, if I couldn't finish
my hamburger in peace,

11:44.637 --> 11:46.913
I'm damn sure gonna finish
my french fries that way.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.178
Carl?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.519
You best get to
walking, Mr. Walker.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.483
You and your beard.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.318
For your hospitality.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.493
Hope you boys enjoy
the rest of your day.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.243
Shit!

12:13.833 --> 12:15.938
How in the hell we supposed to get
a look inside that pizza place,

12:16.035 --> 12:17.946
now he knows all surfaces?

12:20.506 --> 12:22.611
You got something
you want to say to me?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.086
What, about you
and AUSA Napoleon

12:24.177 --> 12:27.590
bullying my Cl and generally
getting up in my shit?

12:27.680 --> 12:28.840
No, I can't think of a thing.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.053
You need to bear in mind

12:30.116 --> 12:31.476
we're up in your shit
for a reason.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.004
Well, as long as
there's a reason.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.406
Saying, your CI
ain't the only one

12:34.454 --> 12:35.797
not delivering on Boyd Crowder.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.266
Hey. I thought
we were taking our time.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.538
"It's a RICO case, Raylan.
All eyes watching.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.073
"Think long game."
All of that.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.209
I'm the bloodhound, boss. You're
the one holding the leash.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.443
You have no idea.

12:48.534 --> 12:49.569
Ain't easy, huh?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.616
It's a bitch running
that office with you out here

12:51.704 --> 12:53.206
running around all untethered.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.943
Rachel, you start to missing me,

12:55.041 --> 12:57.954
you don't got to take it out
on my CI, mess up my work.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.915
You want to babysit me, fine.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.539
Come out with me,
ride the high country.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.549
Don't be acting like
I'm some civvy housewife

13:03.616 --> 13:05.425
you're taking
for a ride-along, either.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.287
Take it how you want.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.799
Are you coming to the next thing
or am I driving you back?

13:09.922 --> 13:11.230
The next thing being what?

13:11.457 --> 13:13.459
Fella named Luther,
runs the explosive cage

13:13.559 --> 13:14.765
at obsidian mine shaft.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.272
I was gonna stop by,
yank his chain a bit.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.330
You know him?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.738
We dug coal together.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.011
And that helps us how?

13:21.100 --> 13:22.511
When we dug coal together,

13:22.602 --> 13:23.979
we dug coal with Boyd Crowder.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.487
Yeah, well, check down that main
shaft, Bill, and get back to me.

13:32.578 --> 13:33.579
All right.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.031
Raylan!

13:42.488 --> 13:45.935
Well, you ain't changed a jot
or a tittle since we last.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.166
Well, now, you're a little
grayer around the temples.

13:49.595 --> 13:51.336
Must be keeping away
from that 'shine.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.942
Found it didn't agree with me.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.276
Yeah, Raylan used to
drown hisself in 'shine

13:55.335 --> 13:57.474
this colored boy'd bring
up from Stillwater.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.608
Like to set your balls on fire.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.652
Now, he'd go read a book
at lunch time,

14:02.942 --> 14:05.855
but when that Flintstone
whistle end of the day come,

14:05.945 --> 14:08.482
he was the first one
cracking them mason jars.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.855
Last one drunk, as I recall.
Heh.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.857
You was a skinny
little minny, too.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.989
I never sussed
how you managed that.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.296
Poured most of it in the plants

14:18.324 --> 14:20.065
when you boys weren't looking.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.900
Well, shit.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.034
I always said you was smart.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.573
Smart enough to
get out, anyways.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.478
Lucky might have had
something to do with it, too.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.141
Then again, here I am.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.249
Lucky. That's one
thing I ain't ever been.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.720
You don't know what it was
like around here.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.383
And it ain't getting
any better, either.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.893
I'm sorry to hear it.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.554
Which one is the logbook you
keep track of your explosives

14:46.652 --> 14:47.824
and det cord?

14:47.987 --> 14:50.107
Let me see. Uh... Never mind.
This must be it.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.266
You were saying?

14:52.525 --> 14:53.663
Oh. Heh.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.768
Well, you took off,
and I married Layla,

14:56.863 --> 14:59.002
and shit just went
downhill from there.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.676
We kept house as best we could,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.236
but it just got to be too much.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.177
And I got to drinking.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.712
And, well, I raised
a hand to her one time.

15:07.774 --> 15:08.912
Just one time.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.918
She takes off without so much
as a G-F-Y for good measure.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.019
Left me with
a little boy to raise.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.619
No shit.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.690
I got a daughter,
just a tad still,

15:20.353 --> 15:21.525
but it changes you.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.962
Yeah, well, boys is
a whole other story, uh...

15:25.124 --> 15:28.071
You mind telling me what you're
digging around for there?

15:28.394 --> 15:30.533
I assume you didn't come here
to talk about old times.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.374
The reason why we're
interested in your logbooks...

15:33.433 --> 15:36.539
Have you had any explosives
come up missing last few weeks?

15:36.869 --> 15:39.315
Not that I know of,
and I'd be the one to know.

15:39.405 --> 15:40.543
You sure?

15:40.706 --> 15:42.481
'Cause I'm looking at
your check-in figures

15:42.575 --> 15:44.919
for Emuline 33
det cord last month,

15:45.111 --> 15:47.387
and the check-out figures
for this month...

15:48.381 --> 15:49.951
You know what? The figures
don't quite add up.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.426
Well, maybe your math is wrong.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.828
Maybe you forgot to carry
a one or something.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.432
Well, I don't claim to be
Stephen Hawking, Luther,

15:56.489 --> 15:57.729
but fundamental addition
and subtraction,

15:57.790 --> 16:00.270
I can speak to some mastery of.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.067
And right here,

16:02.161 --> 16:04.767
there's a signature signing
off on the discrepancy,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.910
last name Kent.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.813
This you, Luther?

16:11.737 --> 16:14.081
Okay. Now we know
where Boyd gets his Emulex.

16:15.107 --> 16:16.313
What?

16:16.409 --> 16:17.820
It's not like
they didn't get along,

16:17.910 --> 16:20.117
but Boyd and Luther didn't
run together back when.

16:20.179 --> 16:21.453
You've been gone a long time.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.960
Maybe they, you know, rekindled
their romance or whatever.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.121
Maybe.
There's one way to find out.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.090
Wrap them up,
take them home for a sit-down.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.830
Okay. That's the second time
you've given me the scowly face.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.131
What is the problem?

16:34.594 --> 16:36.938
Something ain't right.
The way he's acting.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.475
I don't know.

16:40.199 --> 16:41.473
Brooks.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.808
Say where, now?

16:45.304 --> 16:46.783
Okay. I'll tell him.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.113
You want to guess
where your Cl is right now?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.881
Oh! Oh!

17:23.976 --> 17:25.579
Oh!

17:27.146 --> 17:28.420
Uh!

17:28.714 --> 17:30.318
I guess I must be
the clumsiest girl

17:30.383 --> 17:31.862
the good Lord ever gave life to.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.591
Y'all have a ladies' room?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.533
...get you another one?

17:40.593 --> 17:42.539
Yeah.
I'll have the same thing.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.307
Can I help you, Miss?

18:25.771 --> 18:29.810
Oh. What in the world
is that thing?

18:30.776 --> 18:33.416
I never seen
anything like that before.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.553
You don't spend
much time in banks, huh?

18:36.882 --> 18:38.953
Well, I don't know.
I've been in banks.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.725
I just never saw a pizza
place with a... A...

18:42.388 --> 18:44.561
What is that?

18:45.491 --> 18:46.731
It's a bank vault.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.929
This place used to be a bank.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.635
That's its vault.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.140
Oh.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.144
Well, what do they
do in there now?

18:54.233 --> 18:55.644
Do they cook pizzas
in it or something?

18:55.735 --> 18:58.147
No, they don't
cook pizzas in it.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.177
It's more like a...

19:00.473 --> 19:02.350
What do you call it?
A curiosity.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.755
It is that.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.514
Hey, what's your name?

19:06.612 --> 19:07.750
Mundo.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.683
Sometimes they call me
Choo-Choo.

19:10.249 --> 19:13.128
Choo-choo.
I never heard that before.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.591
I like trains.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.661
- Is that right?
Choo-choo.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.696
What are we doing, bub?

19:19.191 --> 19:20.261
Hi.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.937
I was on my way to the
ladies' room and got lost.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.869
I, uh, found myself down here.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.279
I just can't believe
you have this whole big thing

19:30.436 --> 19:33.110
and you don't have, like,
tours or something.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.980
Ladies' is upstairs.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.979
Mundo, will you show
our guest the way?

19:39.612 --> 19:41.614
Let's get you up
where you were going.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.626
All right, then.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.222
It was nice meeting you,
I guess.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.497
Likewise.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.697
Hey, you got
a number or something

19:56.796 --> 19:59.003
that I could reach you by in
case you want to come take,

19:59.065 --> 20:00.976
like, a real actual
tour or something?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.740
Oh, I think I can find you.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.508
All right.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.147
Well, you ought to think
about doing that sometime.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.011
Okay. I will, then.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.087
All right.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.019
Hey, I never did
catch your name!

20:16.082 --> 20:18.062
It's Ava. Ava Randolph.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.228
So long, Ava Randolph.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.039
Man, you gotta zoom ii.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.705
Man, I know that.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.507
You... You just gotta
spread your fingers.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.012
Just give it here.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.377
Darker than shit. I wish
she'd have used the flash.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.247
I guess she was
trying to stay all,

20:42.341 --> 20:43.877
you know, clandestine.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.014
Yeah, I mean,
I wish she could have.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.752
You know something? I believe
we've got them outnumbered.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.328
Just 'cause there
was only two of them

20:50.349 --> 20:51.589
don't necessarily mean
there's only two of them.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.220
No, look. Three beds.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.293
Yeah, see?
There's a certain technique

20:56.388 --> 20:57.765
- to photo surveillance.
- There's five of them.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.258
How you figure?

20:59.391 --> 21:00.791
Two more bed rolls
against the wall.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.031
Five men, three beds.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.306
You think we're dealing
with something untoward?

21:07.433 --> 21:09.379
I think they're
sleeping in shifts.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.605
Shit.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.541
Wait. What's that mean?

21:12.738 --> 21:14.979
Means we want to
get to that vault,

21:15.074 --> 21:16.246
even in the middle of the night,

21:16.308 --> 21:18.083
we gonna have to
step over bodies.

21:20.212 --> 21:21.714
When I signed on to this job,

21:21.781 --> 21:23.055
it sounded like easy money.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.835
Now all of a sudden,
it's all World War III.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.821
You want to quit?

21:28.053 --> 21:30.829
'Cause, Earl, you welcome
to step off this train

21:30.923 --> 21:32.425
anywhere along the line.

21:33.759 --> 21:37.138
No. You'll have to excuse
my little brother, Boyd.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.401
Sometimes he ain't got
much of a filter

21:38.464 --> 21:40.068
between his head and his mouth'

21:41.066 --> 21:43.512
But, uh, push comes to shove,
ain't no way he wants out.

21:43.602 --> 21:44.603
Right?

21:45.638 --> 21:46.639
Right.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.980
Which is fortunate, I figure,

21:50.276 --> 21:51.983
seeing how it's already
gonna be a trick for us

21:52.077 --> 21:55.524
to get to that vault where defenders
outnumber attackers five to four.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.451
I can't even imagine
what it would be like

21:57.516 --> 21:58.790
if our number fell to three.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.760
Well, getting to it
ain't the half.

22:02.354 --> 22:05.164
Vault's something called
an Excelsior 5200.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.432
I saw one like it
once in Kuwait.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.431
Had a dent in the door where a tank
shell hit it, couldn't bust through.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.600
What's that mean?

22:12.698 --> 22:14.143
Well, Earl, for starters,

22:14.200 --> 22:15.508
it means I'm gonna
need you to get me

22:15.601 --> 22:17.376
a hell of a lot more Emulex.

22:18.771 --> 22:19.943
Got an address?

22:20.606 --> 22:22.279
Okay.

22:23.209 --> 22:24.950
What?

22:25.811 --> 22:28.121
Well, Luther Kent's
got a couple of priors,

22:28.180 --> 22:30.558
nothing to connect him to Boyd
the team can find. But...

22:30.649 --> 22:31.650
But what?

22:31.784 --> 22:35.288
Three years ago, he got popped for
a DUI when he clipped a billboard.

22:35.487 --> 22:38.195
Staties say he was trying to
switch seats with the passenger,

22:38.290 --> 22:40.031
make it look like
he was driving.

22:40.459 --> 22:43.030
The passenger was his son,
Tyler Kent.

22:43.662 --> 22:47.508
<i>Of course, if you'd like to
come in here with no questions asked...</i>

22:47.633 --> 22:50.637
<i>- That's right.
- ...then you haven't met me yet.</i>

22:54.173 --> 22:55.652
It's open.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.782
Damn, Tyler. What are you
doing to yourself in here?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.415
Dude, I just hit
level 29 on this bitch.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.590
Oh. The sky is the limit now.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.062
Hey! Come on, now!
Got to talk business, man.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.561
Need your expert hand
up the mine.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.064
No, I can't do it, bro. I told you.
It's a one-time deal.

23:09.154 --> 23:12.363
ATF's tight with the books and
it could get daddy in trouble.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.663
You need to worry less
about your daddy

23:14.727 --> 23:16.287
and a little more about
your debt to me.

23:16.528 --> 23:18.208
Boyd needs more boom,
and a shitload of it.

23:18.264 --> 23:19.902
The good news is, you deliver,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.603
we gonna take care
of you and your daddy.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.108
Man, y'all looking to get shot?

23:24.503 --> 23:26.676
Lord, I hope not. Was one
of you gonna shoot us?

23:27.206 --> 23:28.947
You better get your asses
off the premises.

23:29.174 --> 23:30.734
Else maybe I'll pop you
for trespassers.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.754
Don't do that, Tyler. It'll
break your daddy's heart

23:32.845 --> 23:34.449
any which way this story ends.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.856
Bad enough he's got to cover
you stealing his Emulex

23:37.116 --> 23:39.221
and for this hilljack
asswaffle, no less.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.556
Hey, badge or no badge, you got no
right coming here, talking shit.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.293
Actually, we got all
that right and more.

23:43.455 --> 23:44.456
Yeah?

23:44.556 --> 23:47.594
Well, how 'bout you come out from behind
that pussy badge and I show <i>you...</i>

23:50.930 --> 23:52.238
Sit your ass down.

23:53.365 --> 23:54.537
Now...

23:55.234 --> 23:56.372
We still got a problem,

23:56.635 --> 23:58.979
or you want to reconsider
your earlier position?

24:04.043 --> 24:05.386
You don't know me,

24:05.444 --> 24:07.924
but I know your pop since
we was younger than you.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.391
Told me he had a son.

24:09.548 --> 24:12.893
I confess, I thought he meant
just a tad like my own kid.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.258
I guess I started later in
life, but that's on me.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.232
Anyways, he's worried
about you, Tyler,

24:18.290 --> 24:19.826
and I suppose I am, too.

24:19.925 --> 24:22.906
Find you've been in charge of some
shady bookkeeping at the mine,

24:22.962 --> 24:26.171
such that the ATF might want
to start a whole circus up.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.267
Before I saw you got company,

24:28.334 --> 24:31.611
I was gonna take you back to
Lexington, have a little chat,

24:31.670 --> 24:33.670
see if I could help you
get in front of this thing.

24:34.073 --> 24:37.350
Yeah, well, I got company.

24:38.610 --> 24:39.748
Right.

24:39.812 --> 24:40.972
So, here's what I'm thinking.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.787
Why don't you two finish whatever
it is you got cooked up.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.497
And say the second you steer
clear of this numb nuts,

24:47.920 --> 24:50.628
I want you to give me a call,
and we'll have that chat.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.799
Call that number. Anytime.

24:54.860 --> 24:55.930
Okay, then.

24:56.528 --> 24:57.939
Y'all be good, now.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.270
Hey, you okay?

25:00.466 --> 25:01.945
No, I'm not
goddamn okay!

25:02.034 --> 25:03.775
Son of a bitch like to
crush my nuts into paste.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.440
Well, now you see why
I can't help you.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.778
He's talking ATF, man!

25:06.872 --> 25:08.613
Don't smart me right now, Tyler.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.945
It might make me hurt you.

25:11.276 --> 25:13.620
And you don't like it
when I hurt you, do you?

25:15.714 --> 25:17.125
No.
Good.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.357
'Cause I got us a new plan
to get that Emulex.

25:20.452 --> 25:22.193
And the good news in this plan,

25:22.287 --> 25:24.130
you ain't got to lie to nobody.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.142
Earl, you back already?

25:38.137 --> 25:39.377
Earl?

26:12.271 --> 26:13.944
Maybe we should
leave the guns here.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.519
To do what, man? How we supposed
to do a hold-up with no guns?

26:16.575 --> 26:18.680
Well, I just... I don't
want to see my daddy hurt.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.348
Well, that there's
all the more reason.

26:20.612 --> 26:23.525
Gun in his face, less chance
he's gonna try to be a hero.

26:23.782 --> 26:26.063
And if you think about it, it's
really for his protection.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.123
And, wait, we have
to knock him around?

26:29.855 --> 26:32.529
You want it to look
right, don't you? Yeah.

26:32.724 --> 26:36.137
Far as he knows, two guys in
masks busted in, touched him up,

26:36.228 --> 26:37.639
grabbed the keys
to the Emulex shed.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.208
Okay. The cops see
bruises on him,

26:39.364 --> 26:42.072
goes a long way convincing
them he wasn't in on it. Yeah.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.943
Again, it's for his protection.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.048
Man.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.712
You know what I wouldn't
give to pull a mask on,

26:49.808 --> 26:51.310
take a few free pokes
at my daddy?

26:52.578 --> 26:53.716
Let's go.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.068
Well, I guess we know why they
stopped at a five-and-dime.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.338
Halloween come early.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.808
You think they think
if we don't hear their voices,

27:17.903 --> 27:19.780
we won't know
who's under those masks?

27:19.972 --> 27:23.351
Were you boys not listening when
I said we followed you here?

27:25.444 --> 27:27.082
All right.
Let's start over.

27:27.679 --> 27:30.922
Guns down, hands up.
You first, Mr. "Pussy Badge."

27:35.954 --> 27:37.160
What if I say no?
Earl, maybe we ought...

27:37.256 --> 27:39.497
Shut up, bitch!
This don't concern you.

27:39.591 --> 27:40.592
Earl.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.805
Earl?

27:44.930 --> 27:47.706
You really need me to
run down all the "or elses“?

27:47.933 --> 27:50.777
Actually, I was hoping you'd
try grabbing my prick again,

27:50.836 --> 27:52.916
see if it goes the same way
now I'm paying attention.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.642
I ain't gonna grab it.
I'm just gonna shoot it off.

27:56.441 --> 27:59.615
You understand me, Earl?
I'm gonna shoot your dick off.

28:00.112 --> 28:03.150
Since stealing explosives falls
under terrorism now, right?

28:03.315 --> 28:04.953
Yeah.
We got nothing to lose.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.284
We just want to know
who the Emulex is for.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.895
Name will do.
Save us a lot of body bags.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.698
Earl? How do you think
your daddy's! feel

28:11.790 --> 28:12.791
about his only boy

28:12.858 --> 28:14.804
living the rest
of his life as a snitch?

28:14.860 --> 28:18.831
I think he'd like to see him live the
rest of his life. Ain't that so, Luther?

28:22.367 --> 28:23.505
I don't know.

28:24.736 --> 28:28.013
I always said I'd never see a
son of mine die down a mine.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.320
Least here, he could punch
out looking up at the stars.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.551
Be kind of like floating away.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.151
You're not really
gonna let this happen.

28:42.654 --> 28:44.827
What if I said I took
the Emulex, Raylan?

29:12.517 --> 29:14.360
Have you seen <i>Chinatown,</i> Boyd?

29:36.975 --> 29:38.283
That's your second warning.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.651
There won't be a third.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.791
See, we need to hear you say it.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.731
That you understand.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.798
I understand.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.735
All right, then.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.748
That was smart, sending that
smoke show to do your recon.

30:07.606 --> 30:08.983
Figure everybody's
too busy looking at her

30:09.074 --> 30:10.644
to see where she's looking.

30:12.844 --> 30:16.758
Wonder if that'll still work when
she's not so easy to look at.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.142
Miss?

30:35.767 --> 30:37.474
Apologies for the intrusion.

30:38.136 --> 30:39.615
Uh, can I help you?

30:40.205 --> 30:43.345
I hope you won't find me too
bold asking to be invited in

30:43.442 --> 30:45.615
for a quick word
this fine evening?

30:46.278 --> 30:48.622
I'm sorry.
I don't know you.

30:49.114 --> 30:50.889
I'm not generally inclined to...

30:51.350 --> 30:53.853
Not generally inclined to invited
strange men into your house?

30:54.553 --> 30:55.964
Well, I'd say

30:56.021 --> 30:58.228
it's a good thing you
and I are some acquainted.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.635
I'll only need a few minutes
of your time, Ms. Crowder.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.536
Now, you got anything
to drink in there?

31:21.580 --> 31:24.754
You know, I grew up
in Kentucky my life entire,

31:26.318 --> 31:29.356
yet I never developed
a taste for bourbon.

31:31.356 --> 31:34.667
Even the smell turns
something in me sour.

31:35.761 --> 31:38.765
Well, if I had known
I was having company,

31:39.164 --> 31:41.166
I could have had something
more to your taste.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.070
Oh, I could have called.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.179
But somehow, I didn't imagine
that'd have quite the same impact.

31:49.374 --> 31:53.880
Now we know where you're from
and your preference in liquor.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.559
You think maybe you could
tell me who the hell you are?

31:56.882 --> 31:57.952
Ava...

31:58.517 --> 32:01.123
You mind if I call you Ava?

32:01.787 --> 32:04.233
If I do mind,

32:04.523 --> 32:07.231
I'll just add it to the list of
things I'm holding against you.

32:08.026 --> 32:09.972
Ava, I've known
my share of criminals.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.938
It's an ugly part of my past
that I hope to remedy

32:14.032 --> 32:16.603
by investing more wisely
in the future.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.708
Well, you're off to a bang-up
start kidnapping me.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.215
Wasn't my choice, I assure you.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.954
Whose was it, then? His?

32:26.912 --> 32:28.289
It was yours.

32:30.982 --> 32:33.462
Come to reconnoiter
my place of business,

32:34.319 --> 32:37.266
living some fantasy outlaw life,

32:37.322 --> 32:40.064
just you and Boyd
against the world.

32:41.092 --> 32:43.402
Sounds like you know
a thing or two about it.

32:43.495 --> 32:46.601
I know for a woman to
survive in this line of work,

32:46.665 --> 32:48.576
she's got to be harder
than the men,

32:49.334 --> 32:51.644
ready to do the things
they won't.

32:52.170 --> 32:54.582
I know women
who have that in them.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.419
My question is,

32:57.909 --> 33:01.152
are you that kind of woman, Ava?

33:02.013 --> 33:03.492
Because if you ain't,

33:04.816 --> 33:07.524
then you'll never be
more than a token,

33:09.688 --> 33:13.261
something that can be
threatened or hurt

33:14.159 --> 33:16.298
just to keep your man in line.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.322
You know you're looking down the
barrel of federal terrorism charges,

33:38.383 --> 33:40.863
your little act
of noblesse oblige here.

33:40.952 --> 33:42.863
I suppose that's
my cross to bear, then.

33:42.954 --> 33:46.231
But why, Luther? I told you.
We're after Boyd.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.167
You mean you're after
my boy giving him up.

33:49.794 --> 33:51.899
What kind of life do you
think there is around here

33:51.997 --> 33:53.806
for the man who flips
on Boyd Crowder?

33:55.634 --> 33:59.582
Did you know Tyler wanted
to go to Big Sandy JC,

33:59.671 --> 34:02.379
study X-ray tech,
but I couldn't afford it?

34:03.408 --> 34:06.355
Figured this way, at least he
can say I give him something.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.391
Luther, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

34:08.480 --> 34:10.083
but your son is beyond helping.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.984
And that story of yours
about putting him up to it,

34:13.051 --> 34:14.393
that ain't gonna hold water.

34:14.819 --> 34:17.732
Tyler is going down
for this. The end.

34:18.156 --> 34:19.692
Now, if you want to volunteer

34:19.824 --> 34:21.235
to take the fall with him,

34:21.326 --> 34:22.646
I'm sure we can free up
some space

34:22.661 --> 34:24.231
at the Harlan County
Detention Center.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.400
You can hold his hand
while he awaits arraignment.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.677
But you think you're gonna
climb up on a cross

34:28.867 --> 34:30.869
and pay for his sins,
you're a fool.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.176
You're a fool.
You understand?

34:33.605 --> 34:35.607
You say you got
a baby girl of your own?

34:35.739 --> 34:37.242
That's right.
Well, right now,

34:37.342 --> 34:39.913
I reckon she's not
much more than a lump

34:40.011 --> 34:42.889
that cries and shits
and makes baby noises.

34:42.947 --> 34:44.018
It's like you've met her.

34:44.181 --> 34:45.855
Yeah, and you're gonna
tell me that absent

34:45.917 --> 34:49.262
even any personality she
might one day cultivate,

34:49.353 --> 34:50.764
there ain't one thing
in this world

34:50.855 --> 34:52.266
you wouldn't do for that gob?

34:53.058 --> 34:54.297
That don't stop, son.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.634
And it don't get any easier.

34:57.929 --> 34:58.964
You'll see.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.468
Yeah. We're done.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.718
Hello, again, Boyd.

35:21.586 --> 35:22.929
Oh, Mr. Walker.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.308
Well, now that I'm
feeling more myself,

35:25.390 --> 35:28.303
I sure do wish I had
a second chance

35:28.393 --> 35:29.929
to make a first impression.

35:31.062 --> 35:33.269
But I get the distinct feeling

35:33.732 --> 35:36.235
you ain't the person
I'm here to talk to.

35:47.912 --> 35:49.414
Nice to meet you, sir.

35:49.914 --> 35:51.325
My name is Boyd Crowder.

35:52.017 --> 35:53.189
We've met.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.857
Well, in that case, I'm afraid
you have me at a disadvantage.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.132
My name's Avery Markham.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.704
Guess I can't blame you
for not remembering.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.666
Last time I saw you, you
were no bigger than minute.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.274
Nine, 10 years old.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.811
Peacocking around your daddy

36:12.971 --> 36:16.111
like you thought you was
already a full-grown bad man.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.019
I recognize you now,
Mr. Markham.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.283
That being said,

36:23.848 --> 36:26.852
I still don't recall
being bounced on your knee.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.524
Nevertheless, it, uh,

36:31.456 --> 36:32.867
seems that I owe you an apology.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.835
Like I said,

36:35.493 --> 36:37.632
I can't blame you
for not remembering.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.902
No, sir.

36:39.631 --> 36:43.408
The apology that I owe
is for my craven attempt

36:43.501 --> 36:46.141
to pilfer that which
rightfully belongs to you.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.641
As defense, I offer

36:49.741 --> 36:51.186
only my ignorance.

36:53.411 --> 36:54.583
Meaning you thought you were

36:54.679 --> 36:56.158
stealing from Calhoun?

36:56.514 --> 36:59.017
Yes, sir. I did.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.562
And now you know
the prize in question

37:02.654 --> 37:03.655
belongs to me.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.326
That, I do.
Mmm-hmm.

37:05.924 --> 37:10.998
And any, uh, plan
that I had for my next attempt

37:11.496 --> 37:13.908
should be considered
abandoned as foolhardy...

37:14.499 --> 37:16.274
Not to say, unworthy.

37:24.676 --> 37:25.848
Hmm.

37:26.211 --> 37:29.590
I hope you'll understand
when I say

37:29.681 --> 37:33.458
I don't want to see either
of you at the Portal again.

37:34.018 --> 37:36.396
Next time you want
a slice, order in.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.026
Have it here in 30 minutes,
or it's free.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.737
And if I see you in my place
of business again...

37:46.698 --> 37:47.904
I'll kill you.

38:00.578 --> 38:02.148
Come to it...

38:03.248 --> 38:05.285
I guess you ain't
all that big now.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.225
Grown...

38:09.454 --> 38:12.230
But still just playing pretend.

38:16.561 --> 38:18.438
Ma'am.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.811
I'm heading back to the office.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.418
You coming or staying?

38:32.477 --> 38:34.457
I'm staying.
See how this shakes out.

38:34.679 --> 38:37.319
What about the other one,
Boyd's little minion, Earl?

38:37.916 --> 38:39.293
You rolling him out, too?

38:39.350 --> 38:40.420
I was gonna lei him go.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.599
Send him back to Boyd jumpy,

38:43.655 --> 38:45.999
get him all spun up
before I swoop back down

38:46.090 --> 38:47.091
on my white horse.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.635
That's actually how you see
this going down, isn't it?

38:49.694 --> 38:51.367
Why not?
Worked for Gary Cooper.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.605
Picking up Tyler on the Emulex
is the beginning.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.445
But if he doesn't flip and you
kicking Earl back to Boyd...

39:01.105 --> 39:03.142
I guess this is my way of saying

39:03.274 --> 39:05.117
I hope you know
what you're doing.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.618
I do, too.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.566
Mikey, once again,

39:25.663 --> 39:28.473
talking while I'm in here
can lead to unevenness

39:28.533 --> 39:29.807
in my facial tone.

39:29.868 --> 39:30.869
It's Crowder.

39:31.302 --> 39:32.372
Fine.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.642
Tell him I'll call him
after my session.

39:34.839 --> 39:36.841
He wants
a sit-down tonight

39:37.675 --> 39:39.052
Wants Mrs. Hale here, too.

39:41.246 --> 39:42.384
He's coming here?

39:44.315 --> 39:45.658
Did he say why?

39:46.150 --> 39:48.687
Just said I better tell Mrs.
Hale to get her ass over here...

39:48.753 --> 39:50.027
His words.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.670
I guess if he's looking to hit
us, he wouldn't call ahead.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.574
Unless he wants
to "high noon“ it.

40:00.665 --> 40:04.078
Have us get Katherine over here
so we're all in one place.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.851
He also told me to get him
a room for the night.

40:11.709 --> 40:13.882
A room?
What he said.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.792
What the...

40:18.182 --> 40:19.786
So, what should I do?

40:21.119 --> 40:24.123
Call Katherine. Have her
get her ass over here.

40:24.222 --> 40:25.599
And then call the from desk,

40:25.690 --> 40:27.465
hope to hell
they have a vacancy.

40:29.694 --> 40:30.934
And when you search Crowder,

40:31.029 --> 40:32.309
make sure you get
his cigarettes.

41:00.091 --> 41:01.331
I found the money.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.473
Mighta found it
a whole lot sooner

41:05.563 --> 41:07.203
you'd been straight
with me from the jump.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.910
You want a drink, Boyd?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.275
I want to know why
you didn't tell me

41:10.335 --> 41:12.144
we were robbing Avery Markham.

41:12.837 --> 41:13.941
Wynn, drink?

41:14.238 --> 41:15.308
I'm rehydrating.

41:15.773 --> 41:16.911
Okay.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.191
I was worried if I told you,
you might not take the job.

41:32.423 --> 41:34.494
Because of Markham's reputation

41:34.592 --> 41:37.129
or because he used to be
your husband's partner?

41:37.362 --> 41:38.636
He was much more than that.

41:38.863 --> 41:40.467
Well, that sounds like a story.

41:40.698 --> 41:41.898
It had its moments.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.600
Well, as a man with a keen
regard for history,

41:44.602 --> 41:46.282
I'd normally be
more than happy to hear it.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.980
But right now, Katherine,

41:49.640 --> 41:52.143
I find myself more
concerned with the present

41:52.477 --> 41:55.458
Meaning? What is your
relationship with him now?

41:55.880 --> 41:57.223
No offense, Boyd,

41:57.315 --> 41:59.192
but if I really wanted
to set you up,

41:59.283 --> 42:01.490
I'm sure I could find
an easier way.

42:01.552 --> 42:02.553
That ain't what I asked.

42:04.889 --> 42:06.698
I'm sleeping with him.

42:07.458 --> 42:10.632
That's how I knew he was
moving back into Kentucky,

42:11.029 --> 42:13.532
and that's how I knew
to put you onto his realtor.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.302
Huh.
Hmm.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.751
Woman, how do you see this
playing out in your mind?

42:27.412 --> 42:29.016
You think he's not gonna
put it together

42:29.080 --> 42:30.991
that you were in on
ripping him off?

42:31.582 --> 42:33.425
Avery Markham's
not a man to sit still

42:33.518 --> 42:34.997
while someone takes what's his,

42:35.386 --> 42:37.696
let them go live the good life

42:37.755 --> 42:39.098
somewhere on his dime.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.567
So, you're out, right?
That's what you're saying?

42:41.659 --> 42:45.835
I mean, let's just set aside
all this poetic, down-home,

42:45.897 --> 42:47.103
hillbilly bullshit.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.836
Bottom line is
you're backing down.

42:49.934 --> 42:51.345
Oh, I ain't
backing down.

42:51.769 --> 42:53.009
I'm gonna rob him.

42:54.272 --> 42:57.583
And then I'm gonna stick a
bullet in your boyfriend's head.

43:00.711 --> 43:02.213
You know what, Boyd?

43:02.513 --> 43:04.254
From the moment I met you,

43:04.348 --> 43:07.420
I just knew you were
the man of my dreams.

43:27.538 --> 43:29.279
You get her to come clean?

43:30.708 --> 43:32.779
Clean as she's gonna come.

43:34.545 --> 43:36.422
How you doing, darlin"?

43:38.549 --> 43:39.823
Better now.

43:44.222 --> 43:46.327
Just laying here thinking.

43:47.492 --> 43:49.631
Those men coming
after us like that.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.171
Ava, that ain't never
gonna happen again.

43:52.497 --> 43:53.669
I know.

43:54.232 --> 43:55.575
I don't doubt you, Boyd.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.073
Good. Don't.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.416
But I do have to wonder,
now that it's quiet...

44:03.341 --> 44:05.446
How much money are we
talking about here?

44:05.977 --> 44:07.479
And how are you planning on
going after it,

44:07.578 --> 44:08.579
given their actions?

44:08.779 --> 44:10.122
I thought you said
you trusted me.

44:10.481 --> 44:11.687
I do.

44:12.350 --> 44:14.023
Then how come you need
to know the particulars

44:14.118 --> 44:15.859
about how I go about
my business?

44:18.356 --> 44:21.667
I'm scared, Boyd.
You can't see that?

44:22.360 --> 44:23.600
They came into my home.

44:23.761 --> 44:24.831
And I told you

44:24.929 --> 44:26.636
you ain't gonna have to worry
about that again, Ava.

44:26.697 --> 44:29.109
What if we just ran?

44:31.435 --> 44:32.539
Just lit out?

44:33.538 --> 44:34.676
Start over, do...

44:36.007 --> 44:37.543
I don't know, anything else.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.448
Why not?

44:40.278 --> 44:42.053
Ava, I ain't leaving
here with nothing.

44:42.380 --> 44:43.791
You have me.
Do I?

44:46.017 --> 44:48.190
Last night
was beautiful.

44:49.787 --> 44:52.165
But if I'm being
honest with you, Ava,

44:52.557 --> 44:53.797
since you got out,

44:54.325 --> 44:57.135
sometimes I feel like I don't
know who you are anymore.

45:02.800 --> 45:03.835
Tell you what.

45:07.638 --> 45:09.140
You come on over here,

45:09.874 --> 45:11.512
and I'll remind you.
