01:21.888 --> 01:25.558
BOY, IT FEELS GOOD
TO BE FINALLY GETTING
THE OLD STAR CRUISER IN SHAPE.

01:25.559 --> 01:29.128
I'M GLAD THE NUTRINOS
LEFT IT BEHIND WHEN THEY WENT
BACK TO DIMENSION-X.

01:29.129 --> 01:32.131
IT'S GOOD THING
THEY LEFT THE TOOL
BOX IN THE TRUNK.

01:32.132 --> 01:34.734
HAND ME A PROTON WRENCH,
WOULD YA?

01:34.735 --> 01:36.735
UH, YOU MEAN THIS?

01:36.736 --> 01:39.404
NO! THAT'S AN ANTIMATTER
SPARK PLUG.

01:39.405 --> 01:41.807
OF COURSE IT IS.
SORRY.

01:41.808 --> 01:43.141
OH, NO!

01:44.143 --> 01:46.244
BE CAREFUL, WOULD YA?

01:46.245 --> 01:49.314
YEAH, I GUESS THOSE
IMPORTED PARTS
ARE HARD TO COME BY.

01:49.315 --> 01:51.316
SO ARE MY BODY PARTS.

01:51.317 --> 01:53.085
OUTSIDE THE STAR CRUISER ENGINE,

01:53.086 --> 01:56.754
A SINGLE ANTIMATTER SPARK
COULD DESTROY THE ENTIRE CITY.

01:56.755 --> 01:59.824
HOLD ON TO YOUR SHELLS,
AMIGOS.

01:59.825 --> 02:03.128
I'VE GOT THE PRIMO
SPORTS CAR ACCESSORY--

02:03.129 --> 02:05.229
FUZZY DICE!

02:08.066 --> 02:11.033
HEY, WHAT TOOK YOU?
YOU PROMISED TO HELP
POLISH ALL THIS CHROME.

02:11.035 --> 02:15.439
HEY, LIGHTEN UP, DUDE,
I'VE GOT A GOOD EXCUSE
FOR BEING LATE.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.644
I WAS CHECKING OUT
THE LATEST MODELS
AT BELLYBOARDS R US.

02:19.645 --> 02:24.181
THEY'VE GOT A NEW ONE
THAT'S PERFECTOMUNDO
FOR SEWER SURFING.

02:24.182 --> 02:27.552
SO HOW ABOUT LENDING ME
A FEW BUCKS?

02:27.553 --> 02:31.287
I SPENT MY LAST CENTAVA
MONEY ON THESE
GALLOPING DOMINOS.

02:31.288 --> 02:32.522
I WISH I COULD HELP.

02:32.523 --> 02:34.624
BUT I SPENT ALL
MY MONEY ON NEW
SEAT BELTS.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.859
AND I SPRUNG
FOR THE NEW GAS PEDAL.

02:36.860 --> 02:38.628
I BLEW ALL MY MONEY
ON A NEW HORN.

02:39.696 --> 02:43.233
WHOA, I GUESS
I'LL JUST HAVE TO...

02:43.234 --> 02:44.634
GET A JOB.

02:44.635 --> 02:48.738
YOU CAN'T!
JUST BEING A NINJA TURTLE
IS A FULL-TIME JOB.

02:48.739 --> 02:50.607
AND YOU CAN'T
TAKE THE RISK.

02:50.608 --> 02:54.143
EVEN WITH
A DISGUISE, SOMEONE
MIGHT RECOGNIZE YOU.

02:54.144 --> 02:57.714
BESIDES,
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ANYTHING.

02:57.715 --> 03:00.248
ULTIMO BUMMER, DUDES.

03:00.249 --> 03:04.653
I HAD MY BELLY SET
ON THAT HEART BOARD.

03:04.654 --> 03:06.154
DID THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

03:06.155 --> 03:08.290
IT'S NO SUPPOSED TO.
MICHELANGELO SAID IT.

03:09.860 --> 03:12.661
MICHELANGELO,
WHY AREN'T YOU
HELPING THE OTHERS

03:12.662 --> 03:14.229
WORK ON
THE STAR CRUISER?

03:14.230 --> 03:17.232
<i>I WISH WE'D NEVER
STARTED, SENSEI.</i>

03:17.233 --> 03:20.836
WE SPENT
ALL OUR MONEY ON
THAT STAR CRUISER.

03:20.837 --> 03:23.839
SO NO I CAN'T HAVE
A NEW BELLY BOARD.

03:23.840 --> 03:28.175
THE PATH THAT LEADS TO
WHAT WE TRULY DESIRE IS
LONG AND DIFFICULT.

03:28.176 --> 03:30.378
BUT ONLY BY FOLLOWING
THAT PATH,

03:30.379 --> 03:33.548
DO WE ACHIEVE OUR GOAL.

03:33.549 --> 03:36.484
WHAT?
FOLLOW A PATH?

03:36.485 --> 03:38.920
I GUESS HE WANTS ME
TO TAKE A HIKE.

03:38.921 --> 03:42.657
<i>POLICE ARE BAFFLED BY
THE STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE
OF A TANKER TRUCK</i>

03:42.658 --> 03:45.793
<i>FILLED WITH TOMATO SAUCE.
BUT FIRST, THIS COMMERCIAL.</i>

03:45.794 --> 03:48.029
<i>TIRED OF THE SAME
OLD PIZZA?</i>

03:48.030 --> 03:51.799
WHOA, WHERE HAVE I SEEN
THOSE HANDS BEFORE?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.701
<i>AT WEIRD PIZZA TO GO,</i>

03:53.702 --> 03:56.636
<i>THERE'S NO INGREDIENT
TOO OUTRAGEOUS.</i>

03:56.637 --> 03:59.973
<i>OUR CHEFS WILL CUSTOM BUILD
A PIZZA JUST FOR YOU</i>

03:59.974 --> 04:01.942
<i>NO MATTER HOW REVOLTING.</i>

04:01.943 --> 04:03.276
ALL RIGHT!

04:03.277 --> 04:04.778
<i>JUST ONE BITE,</i>

04:04.779 --> 04:08.281
<i>AND YOU'LL SAY
THIS PIZZA IS WEIRD.</i>

04:08.282 --> 04:10.283
<i>TRY OUR DOUBLE
JALAPENO SPECIAL.</i>

04:10.284 --> 04:12.285
<i>GUARANTEED HOT
ON DELIVERY.</i>

04:12.286 --> 04:13.787
<i>JUST CALL 555-YUCK,</i>

04:13.788 --> 04:17.290
<i>AND SAY
MAKE IT WEIRD TO GO!</i>

04:17.291 --> 04:18.692
THAT'S IT!

04:18.692 --> 04:22.795
A NEW PIZZA PARLOR
IS SURE TO NEED
A DELIVERY BOY.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.396
UH, OR TURTLE.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.399
BODACIOUS CONCEPT!
A FEW NIGHTS WORK

04:27.400 --> 04:30.903
AND I'LL HAVE ENOUGH
FOR THAT NEW BELLY BOARD.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.550
OH, THIS IS FUN.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.351
ROCK STEADY, BEBOP,

04:46.352 --> 04:49.554
IF YOU BLISTERHEADS
HAD STOLEN
A DECENT CAR,

04:49.555 --> 04:52.090
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
FIND A DELIVERY BOY!

04:52.091 --> 04:55.093
OH, GIVE US
ANOTHER CHANCE, BOSS.

04:55.094 --> 04:59.698
YEAH, THIS TIME WE'LL
SWIPE A POLICE CAR.

04:59.699 --> 05:00.632
SILENCE!

05:00.633 --> 05:02.767
IT'S THE COMMLINK.

05:02.768 --> 05:06.037
SHREDDER, HOW LONG
DO I HAVE TO WAIT

05:06.038 --> 05:10.742
BEFORE YOUR PIZZA PARLOR
DELIVERS THE TURTLES TO ME?

05:10.743 --> 05:14.445
SOON, KRANG.
THIS IDEA IS FOOLPROOF.

05:14.446 --> 05:16.681
THE TURTLES WON'T
BE ABLE TO RESIST

05:16.682 --> 05:18.615
A PIZZERIA
WHERE THEY CAN ORDER

05:18.616 --> 05:20.684
ANY INGREDIENTS
THEY WANT.

05:20.685 --> 05:23.286
WHEN I GET A REALLY
WEIRD ORDER,

05:23.287 --> 05:26.089
A PIZZA ONLY
A TURTLE COULD LOVE,

05:26.090 --> 05:28.291
I WILL HAVE THEM.

05:28.292 --> 05:30.728
HOW CAN YOU
BE SO SURE?

05:30.729 --> 05:33.330
BECAUSE I PLAN
TO TOP THEIR PIZZA

05:33.331 --> 05:38.135
WITH A HOMING DEVICE
DISGUISED AS AN ANCHOVY.
HA HA HA.

05:38.136 --> 05:41.538
IT WILL LEAD ME STRAIGHT
TO THE TURTLES' LAIR.

05:41.539 --> 05:44.207
I SEE ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

05:44.208 --> 05:45.307
WHAT PROBLEM
IS THAT?

05:45.308 --> 05:48.143
NOBODY LIKES ANCHOVIES.

05:48.144 --> 05:52.548
THE FOOL.
HE CANNOT RECOGNIZE
TRUE GENIUS.

05:52.549 --> 05:56.318
YEAH, WE KNOW JUST
HOW YOU FEEL, BOSS.

06:01.458 --> 06:04.193
"HELP WANTED.
APPLY AT REAR."

06:04.194 --> 06:06.562
TOTAL OPPORTUNITY!

06:06.563 --> 06:09.331
GETTING THIS JOB WILL BE
A PIECE OF CAKE

06:09.332 --> 06:12.234
OR EVEN BETTER,
A SLICE OF PIZZA.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.241
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

06:20.242 --> 06:23.211
HI, I'M HERE TO APPLY
FOR THE JOB.

06:23.212 --> 06:27.482
IF YOU WANT
YOUR PIZZA DELIVERED,
I'M YOUR...MAN.

06:27.483 --> 06:31.319
OUR PIZZA PARLOR RELIES
ON ITS WEIRD IMAGE.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.887
YOU LOOK
PRETTY NORMAL TO ME.

06:32.888 --> 06:35.824
OH, RADICAL
MISPERCEPTION, DUDE.

06:35.825 --> 06:37.759
I'M WEIRDER
THAN YOU KNOW.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.829
AND BESIDES,
I'VE GOT MY OWN
DELIVERY CAR.

06:41.830 --> 06:43.330
YOUR OWN CAR?

06:43.331 --> 06:47.601
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?
YOU'RE HIRED.

06:47.602 --> 06:50.937
WHERE HAVE I SEEN
THOSE EYES BEFORE?

06:50.938 --> 06:54.441
HERE'S YOUR UNIFORM.
WEAR IT PROUDLY.

06:54.442 --> 06:57.411
WHOA, IT FITS PERFECTLY.

06:57.412 --> 07:01.348
NOW ALL I NEED
IS A DELIVERY CAR.

07:12.393 --> 07:14.861
HEY, COME BACK!

07:14.862 --> 07:17.329
I HAVEN'T FINISHED
FIXING THE AIR BRAKES!

07:23.904 --> 07:26.740
WEIRD PIZZA DELIVERY.

07:32.145 --> 07:36.314
SOMEBODY ORDER A PICKLE
AND ICE CREAM PIZZA?

07:38.484 --> 07:40.652
THANK YOU,
YOUNG MAN.

07:40.653 --> 07:42.153
CHANNEL 6?

07:42.154 --> 07:45.791
WHOA, I SURE HOPE
NOBODY RECOGNIZES ME.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.198
WEIRD PIZZA
DELIVERY.

07:54.199 --> 07:56.300
I'LL TELL THE WORLD.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.036
ONE WHOLE-WHEAT PIZZA

07:58.037 --> 08:00.372
WITH A PLAIN
CHEESE TOPPING.

08:00.373 --> 08:01.807
THAT IS WEIRD.

08:01.808 --> 08:03.274
WELL, THANK YOU.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.078
I SUPPOSE
YOU WANT A TIP.

08:07.079 --> 08:08.612
<i>NO.</i>

08:08.613 --> 08:11.549
HERE'S ONE ANYWAY.
GET ANOTHER JOB.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.624
MONDO TRAFFIC JAM!

08:20.625 --> 08:23.961
AND MY HOT PIZZAS
ARE COOLING OFF FAST.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.732
AS I ALWAYS SAY, IF YOU
CAN'T GET THROUGH TRAFFIC,

08:27.733 --> 08:29.934
GO OVER!

08:29.935 --> 08:32.135
STAR CRUISER
TO HOUSTON CONTROL,

08:32.135 --> 08:33.804
WE HAVE LIFTOFF!

08:35.405 --> 08:38.274
UH-OH, NO AIR BRAKES!

08:53.857 --> 08:56.359
LOOKS LIKE
I'M GOING TO WIPE OUT!

09:01.131 --> 09:03.731
WHOA, BODACIOUS BREAK.

09:03.732 --> 09:05.533
THE ENGINE STALLED.

09:09.372 --> 09:11.440
BUMMER, IT'S FLOODED.

09:11.441 --> 09:15.877
YOU KNOW, I'LL BET DONATELLO
WASN'T USING GENUINE
DIMENSION-X PARTS

09:15.878 --> 09:17.312
ON THIS BABE.

09:18.714 --> 09:21.216
WELL, WHATEVER
MICHELANGELO IS UP TO,

09:21.217 --> 09:23.885
IT HASN'T MADE
THE PAPERS...YET.

09:23.886 --> 09:26.221
HAVE YOU CHECKED
THE FUNNIES?

09:26.222 --> 09:27.555
FIBER.

09:27.556 --> 09:30.024
WHY WOULD HE TAKE
THE STAR CRUISER
LIKE THAT?

09:30.025 --> 09:31.558
WITHOUT TELLING ANYBODY.

09:31.559 --> 09:35.729
WE'LL THINK BETTER
ON A FULL STOMACH.
IT'S PIZZA TIME!

09:37.199 --> 09:39.667
HEY, DONATELLO, I THOUGHT
YOU FIXED THIS.

09:39.668 --> 09:43.904
WHOA! I DID, AND NOW
IT'S FIXING US.

09:43.905 --> 09:45.272
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

09:47.643 --> 09:50.744
THIS BEATS EVERYTHING.
NOW WHAT ARE GOING
TO HAVE FOR DINNER?

09:50.745 --> 09:54.847
SORRY ABOUT
THE PIZZAMATIC, FELLAS.
BUT IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

09:54.848 --> 09:57.718
HEY, GUYS,
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

09:57.719 --> 10:01.288
"WEIRD PIZZA TO GO.
CUSTOM-BUILT PIZZA.

10:01.289 --> 10:04.024
NO INGREDIENT
TOO OUTRAGEOUS."

10:04.025 --> 10:06.026
SOUNDS LIKE
OUR KIND OF PLACE.

10:07.961 --> 10:09.595
THIS WAY, GUYS.

10:12.733 --> 10:15.168
WEIRD PIZZA.
WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE?

10:15.169 --> 10:17.203
I'D LIKE TO ORDER
A PIZZA.

10:17.204 --> 10:20.607
PEANUT BUTTER
AND AVOCADO
WITH EXTRA PICKLES.

10:20.608 --> 10:25.377
EXTRA PICKLES? I SEE.
WHAT'S THE NAME
ON THE ORDER?

10:25.378 --> 10:28.747
DONATELLO. DELIVER IT
TO THE PHONE BOOTH

10:28.748 --> 10:29.915
ON 13th STREET.

10:29.916 --> 10:31.883
DONATELLO, HUH?

10:31.884 --> 10:35.820
WELL, YOU'LL GET WHAT'S
COMING TO YOU...SOON.

10:36.889 --> 10:39.458
WHERE HAVE I HEARD
THAT VOICE BEFORE?

10:41.627 --> 10:46.131
THIS WILL LEAD ME STRAIGHT
TO THE TURTLES' LAIR!

10:46.132 --> 10:48.800
THOSE POOR FISH
ARE HOOKED.

10:48.801 --> 10:51.536
WHERE IS
THAT DELIVERY BOY?

10:51.537 --> 10:53.571
HERE I AM, BOSS.

10:53.572 --> 10:56.574
SORRY. I HAD
A LITTLE CAR
TROUBLE.

10:56.575 --> 10:58.909
I'VE NO TIME
FOR EXCUSES.

10:58.910 --> 11:02.447
DELIVER THIS
TO THE PHONE BOOTH
ON 13th STREET.

11:02.448 --> 11:06.183
THE PHONE BOOTH?
BUT THAT'S WHERE
WE ALWAYS...

11:06.184 --> 11:08.586
YOU ALWAYS WHAT?

11:08.587 --> 11:10.522
OHH, NEVER MIND.

11:10.523 --> 11:13.324
COULDN'T WE JUST
MAIL THIS ONE IN?

11:13.325 --> 11:17.294
YOU'RE A DELIVERY BOY,
SO DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

11:17.295 --> 11:19.263
DELIVER!

11:19.264 --> 11:22.999
WHOA, TALK ABOUT YOUR
LABOR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTE.

11:25.103 --> 11:27.204
OK, THERE HE GOES!

11:27.205 --> 11:29.606
DRIVE CAREFUL NOW.

11:29.607 --> 11:32.242
DON'T WANT
TO ATTRACT ATTENTION.

11:34.712 --> 11:37.781
GEE, DO YOU THINK
WE ATTRACTED
ANY ATTENTION?

11:45.456 --> 11:48.624
MICHELANGELO!
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:48.625 --> 11:51.961
I'VE GOT A PROBLEM, APRIL,
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

11:51.962 --> 11:55.631
THE GUYS ORDERED A PIZZA,
AND I HAVE TO DELIVER IT.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.301
BUT I DON'T WANT THEM
TO KNOW I'VE GOT A JOB.

11:58.302 --> 12:01.471
YOU'VE GOT A JOB?
WHAT FOR?

12:01.472 --> 12:05.107
IT'S A LONG STORY.
BUT I NEED TO ASK YOU A FAVOR.

12:05.108 --> 12:06.876
HMM.
LET ME GUESS.

12:06.877 --> 12:09.278
YOU WANT ME
TO DELIVER IT
FOR YOU.

12:09.279 --> 12:11.581
YOU CATCH ON SO FAST.

12:11.582 --> 12:13.782
WON'T THEY THINK
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD

12:13.783 --> 12:16.017
THAT I'M DELIVERING
WEIRD PIZZAS.

12:16.018 --> 12:20.021
OH, TELL THEM
YOU'RE DOING, LIKE,
AN UNDERCOVER REPORT

12:20.022 --> 12:21.856
ON BOGUS PEPPERONI.

12:21.857 --> 12:25.193
HOW DO I GET
INTO THESE MESSES?

12:25.194 --> 12:28.696
AND DON'T FORGET
WE SPLIT THE TIP!

12:28.697 --> 12:32.933
I WONDER WHY
THE DELIVERY GUY
STOPPED HERE.

12:32.934 --> 12:35.537
MAYBE HE WAS
VISITING HIS MOMMY.

12:35.538 --> 12:38.373
I WISH I COULD
VISIT MY MOMMY.

12:38.374 --> 12:39.874
WHY DON'T YOU?

12:39.875 --> 12:44.778
I TRY. BUT EVERY TIME
SHE SEES ME, SHE RUNS
AWAY SCREAMING.

12:44.779 --> 12:48.282
BOY, IF IT TAKES
THIS LONG TO DELIVER
ONE PIZZA,

12:48.283 --> 12:50.551
I'M GLAD
WE DIDN'T ORDER TWO.

12:50.552 --> 12:51.719
IT'S HERE.

12:58.360 --> 13:03.196
OK, THIS IS
THE LAST PHONE BOOTH
ON THE LIST.

13:08.035 --> 13:10.670
HOW ARE THEY GOING
TO DELIVER A PIZZA
TO THE PHONE BOOTH

13:10.671 --> 13:12.672
WHEN THERE'S
NO PHONE BOOTH.

13:12.673 --> 13:16.342
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE
TO GO TO WEIRD PIZZA AND
PICK UP THE PIZZA OURSELVES.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.982
THIS IS 13th STREET.

13:22.983 --> 13:25.885
I DON'T SEE
A PHONE BOOTH
ANYWHERE.

13:25.886 --> 13:28.554
MAYBE MICHELANGELO
MEANT 13th AVENUE.

13:33.060 --> 13:36.160
A PHONE BOOTH.
THIS MUST BE THE PLACE.

13:36.161 --> 13:39.664
THE DELIVERY GUY
MUST BE IN THAT VAN.

13:39.665 --> 13:42.166
THIS IS IT BEBOP.

13:42.167 --> 13:45.670
WE'RE FINALLY GOING
TO CAPTURE THEM TURTLES.

13:45.671 --> 13:49.041
YOO-HOO,
IS ANYBODY HERE?

13:49.042 --> 13:50.141
I'VE GOT YOUR PIZZA.

13:52.078 --> 13:53.912
THE RAT KING!

13:53.913 --> 13:56.681
PIZZA. HA HA HA, GREAT.

13:56.682 --> 13:59.818
I JUST LOVE JUNK FOOD.

14:05.890 --> 14:09.727
HMM, AVOCADO
AND PEANUT BUTTER?

14:09.728 --> 14:12.330
CRUNCHY OR SMOOTH?

14:12.331 --> 14:14.165
UM, CRUNCHY.

14:14.166 --> 14:17.134
OOH, YEAH.
THAT'S MY FAVORITE.

14:22.107 --> 14:23.975
APRIL CALLING
MICHELANGELO.

14:23.976 --> 14:25.709
COME IN,
MICHELANGELO.

14:25.710 --> 14:28.078
HEY, APRIL,
WHAT'S SHAKIN'?

14:28.079 --> 14:31.248
BAD NEWS.
THE RAT KING
STOLE THE PIZZA.

14:31.249 --> 14:35.051
OH, NO.
MONDO DISASTRO!

14:35.052 --> 14:37.820
I'D BETTER GO BACK
AND TELL THE BOSS.

14:37.821 --> 14:39.823
HOPE HE DOESN'T
GET MAD AT YOU.

14:39.824 --> 14:43.059
NO, HE SEEMS
LIKE A TOTALLY
MELLOW DUDE.

14:43.060 --> 14:45.494
I HOPE SO. APRIL OUT.

14:50.534 --> 14:54.838
HEY, BOSS, IT'S ME.
ROCK STEADY AND BEBOP.

14:54.839 --> 14:57.040
THE SIGNAL'S COMING
FROM RIGHT UNDER US.

14:57.041 --> 15:00.742
THE PIZZA IS ALREADY
IN THE SEWER

15:00.743 --> 15:02.711
HEADING FOR
THE TURTLES' SECRET LAIR.

15:05.848 --> 15:10.553
CLOSED? THEY CAN'T
BE CLOSED! I HAVEN'T
BEEN PAID YET!

15:10.554 --> 15:13.855
Shredder: THE HOMING DEVICE
HIDDEN IN THE ANCHOVY
IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

15:13.856 --> 15:16.958
IT WILL LEAD ME STRAIGHT
TO THE TURTLES' LAIR.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.462
WITH ENOUGH FOOT SOLDIERS
TO STOMP THEM INTO MUSH.

15:20.463 --> 15:22.030
OH, NO!

15:22.031 --> 15:25.033
I'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR SHREDDER.

15:25.034 --> 15:28.869
HE'S BEEN USING PIZZAS
TO TRAP US TURTLES?

15:28.870 --> 15:32.640
I GUESS THAT KILLS
MY CHANCES OF GETTING
A RAISE.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.344
COME WITH ME!

15:36.345 --> 15:40.214
I'D BETTER WARN
THE OTHERS FAST.

15:42.618 --> 15:44.752
SMOOTH MOVE,
MICHELANGELO.

15:44.753 --> 15:46.654
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT STUPID CAP ON?

15:46.655 --> 15:48.756
AND WHY DID YOU TAKE
THE STAR CRUISER?

15:48.757 --> 15:51.259
I TOOK THE STAR CRUISER

15:51.260 --> 15:54.694
TO EARN SOME EXTRA DOUGH
DELIVERING PIZZAS.

15:54.695 --> 15:57.931
EXTRA DOUGH?
YOU MEAN PIZZA DOUGH.

15:57.932 --> 15:59.466
NEVER MIND THAT, DUDES.

15:59.467 --> 16:03.103
I FOUND OUT I'VE BEEN
HAULING PIZZAS FOR SHREDDER.

16:03.104 --> 16:04.538
SHREDDER?

16:04.539 --> 16:07.173
BOY, I KNOW
THE VILLAIN BUSINESS
HAS BEEN BAD LATELY,

16:07.174 --> 16:08.608
BUT THAT'S
RIDICULOUS.

16:08.609 --> 16:12.779
NO, LISTEN, SHREDDER PUT
A HOMING DEVICE IN THE PIZZA,

16:12.780 --> 16:14.748
DISGUISED AS AN ANCHOVY.

16:14.749 --> 16:16.416
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO LEAD HIM TO OUR LAIR.

16:17.485 --> 16:19.919
SHREDDER'S GOING
TO BE REALLY STEAMED.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.588
WHEN HE FINDS OUT
HE'S FOLLOWING THE RAT KING.

16:22.589 --> 16:26.259
HE'S GONNA BE EVEN MADDER
WHEN HE FINDS OUT
WE'RE FOLLOWING HIM.

16:26.260 --> 16:27.193
COME ON!

16:31.664 --> 16:34.499
OK, SET IT DOWN EASY.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.669
OW! OOH! AH! EEE!

16:37.670 --> 16:40.172
THE FOOT SKI'S
ALL READY, BOSS.

16:40.173 --> 16:44.176
EXCELLENT!
THE TURTLES WILL
SOON TASTE MY WRATH

16:44.177 --> 16:46.278
FOR THE LAST TIME.

16:46.279 --> 16:48.080
LAUNCH THE FOOT SKI!

16:51.417 --> 16:53.818
LOOK,THEY'RE HEADING
INTO THE SEWER.

16:53.819 --> 16:55.686
HOW LOW CAN YOU GET?

16:57.156 --> 16:59.591
WE'LL MAKE THIS THE MOST
UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE

16:59.592 --> 17:01.092
SHREDDER'S EVER HAD.

17:01.093 --> 17:04.462
MAKING A SEWER
UNPLEASANT?
WHAT A STRETCH.

17:09.867 --> 17:13.104
HA HA!
WE'RE NOT FAR NOW.

17:16.308 --> 17:20.944
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN NET
A FEW SMALL FISH.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.915
FASTER. FASTER.

17:24.915 --> 17:27.584
WE CAN'T GO NO
FASTER, BOSS.

17:27.585 --> 17:30.020
WE'RE ON THE SAME
FOOT SKI AS YOU.

17:30.021 --> 17:32.956
THIS OUGHT TO DAMPEN
THEIR ENTHUSIASM.

17:47.304 --> 17:49.538
HUH? WHAT WAS THAT?

17:49.539 --> 17:52.875
I THOUGHT WE BROUGHT
MORE FOOT SOLDIERS
THAN THAT.

17:52.876 --> 17:54.444
QUIET, YOU NINCOMPOOP.

17:54.445 --> 17:57.380
I'M TRYING TO HEAR
THE HOMING BLIP.

18:07.958 --> 18:10.560
BETTER NOT LET
ALL THE WATER OUT.

18:15.030 --> 18:17.465
PATIENCE,
MY FAITHFUL SUBJECTS.

18:17.466 --> 18:20.501
YOU'LL SOON SHARE
IN THE LEFTOVERS.

18:20.502 --> 18:24.406
WE'VE TRACKED YOU
TO YOUR LAIR AT LAST.

18:25.774 --> 18:28.943
THIS IS MY PIZZA.
YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY.

18:28.944 --> 18:32.814
EXCEPT THE ANCHOVY.
I DETEST ANCHOVIES.

18:32.815 --> 18:36.218
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THE TURTLES' LAIR?

18:36.219 --> 18:40.954
DO I LOOK LIKE A TURTLE?
I AM THE RAT KING.

18:40.955 --> 18:43.090
THIS IS MY DOMAIN.

18:44.926 --> 18:48.596
TELL ME WHERE
THE TURTLES ARE,

18:48.597 --> 18:52.265
OR I'LL ORDER
MY FOOT SOLDIERS
TO ATTACK.

18:52.266 --> 18:57.170
HEH HEH! WHAT NONSENSE.
MY ROYAL ARMY OF RATS

18:57.171 --> 18:59.906
WILL MAKE SHORT WORK
OF YOUR FOOT SOLDIERS,

18:59.907 --> 19:03.009
WHEREVER THEY ARE.

19:03.010 --> 19:05.946
MY FOOT SOLDIERS!
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM?

19:05.947 --> 19:08.948
I TRIED TO TELL YOU, BOSS.
THEY'RE GONE.

19:08.949 --> 19:11.851
JUST LIKE YOUR CHANCES,
SHREDDER.

19:11.852 --> 19:14.987
WE FLUSHED
YOUR FOOT SOLDIERS
DOWN THE SEWER.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.558
YOU'RE IN OVER
YOUR HEAD IN THESE
SEWERS, SHRED-MAN.

19:19.860 --> 19:23.696
YEAH, DUDE.
A TURTLE'S SEWER
IS HIS CASTLE.

19:23.697 --> 19:27.267
WE'RE SURROUNDED.
TRAPPED LIKE RATS.

19:27.268 --> 19:31.103
NOW, JUST A MOMENT.
I RESENT THAT REMARK.

19:31.104 --> 19:33.439
SURRENDER, SHREDDER.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.241
SAY CHEESE,
SHELLBACK.

19:36.242 --> 19:38.944
GIVE ME BACK MY PIZZA.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.315
I'VE BEEN PIZZA-FACED.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.817
OOH, CRUNCHY.

19:44.818 --> 19:48.053
WAIT FOR US, BOSS!

19:48.054 --> 19:50.188
SHREDDER
NEVER SURRENDERS!

19:50.189 --> 19:52.724
BUT SOMETIMES
YOU GIVE UP.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.693
MAMA!

19:56.295 --> 19:59.864
DON'T JUST YOU HATE IT
WHEN PEOPLE DROP IN
UNANNOUNCED?

20:07.639 --> 20:09.140
LET'S GO!

20:09.141 --> 20:10.874
GET THEM.

20:16.714 --> 20:20.150
I KNEW WE
SHOULDN'T HAVE
TRIED TO HANG 30.

20:20.151 --> 20:22.587
THEY WENT OUT THROUGH
THE MANHOLE!

20:22.588 --> 20:25.089
THE TURTLES!
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

20:27.559 --> 20:29.259
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THEM!

20:32.663 --> 20:34.164
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?

20:34.165 --> 20:36.766
HEAVY ON
THE TOMATO SAUCE?

20:42.873 --> 20:45.508
LOOK, BOSS. A CAR.

20:45.509 --> 20:47.344
LET'S SWIPE IT.

20:47.345 --> 20:50.513
GREAT!
SOMEBODY EVEN LEFT
THE KEY IN IT.

20:50.514 --> 20:53.182
THAT SOMEBODY
HAD TO BE MICHELANGELO.

20:55.252 --> 20:58.253
HEY, THAT'S
OUR STAR CRUISER!

20:58.254 --> 21:01.356
YEAH, LIKE,
BRING BACK OUR WHEELS!

21:01.357 --> 21:03.392
NEXT TIME, TURTLES,

21:03.393 --> 21:05.960
BEWARE THE REVENGE
OF SHREDDER!

21:05.961 --> 21:09.331
HEY, LOOK.
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

21:15.872 --> 21:18.440
STOP THIS THING,
YOU IDIOT!

21:18.441 --> 21:21.877
I CAN'T, BOSS.
NO AIR BRAKES.

21:26.214 --> 21:29.417
NOW WE'LL NEVER GET
THE STAR CRUISER BACK.

21:29.418 --> 21:32.587
AFTER ALL THAT WORK
WE PUT IN TO
FIXING IT UP.

21:32.588 --> 21:37.124
YEAH. AND IT ONLY HAD
83 TRILLION ACTUAL
MILES ON IT.

21:37.125 --> 21:39.694
HEY, CHILL OUT, DUDES.

21:39.695 --> 21:42.797
AT LEAST IT WASN'T
A TOTAL LOSS.
