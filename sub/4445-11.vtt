WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.936
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain.
- (woman): Ah,<i> mi hijo.</i>

00:03.938 --> 00:06.605
So good to have
my two kids together again.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.141
- How many times I have to tell?
No recycling in the hallway.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.276
- Now we're talking about
the way you speak to my mother.

00:11.278 --> 00:14.480
If she ever tells me you talk
to her like that again,

00:14.482 --> 00:16.448
they're gonna find your body

00:16.450 --> 00:18.550
in one of those recycling bins
you love so much.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.620
- What was in
that coffin? Soil...

00:21.622 --> 00:23.188
<i> - Where's that cabinet?</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:25.791
That box was 500 pounds; nothing
could lift it up like that.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.960
- If you have the coffin,
then you still have him!

00:27.962 --> 00:30.396
<i> Do not allow it</i>
<i> across the river!</i>

00:30.398 --> 00:33.732
-<i> Something evil has taken root.</i>
<i> Rats don't migrate like that.</i>

00:33.734 --> 00:35.501
<i> Something's driving them out</i>
<i> from underground.</i>

00:35.503 --> 00:37.836
<i> It's hiding down there</i>
<i> in the dark.</i>

00:37.838 --> 00:39.872
I tracked the epicenter
of the rat-free zone.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.508
We have to look at all
the decommissioned tunnels

00:42.510 --> 00:45.010
near the World Trade Center.
- Kill the Master

00:45.012 --> 00:47.312
and his spawn will die.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.481
- (Zach): They're coming.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.052
- Uh... Alright.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.656
UV light bomb test.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.592
- Hey! No, no, no.
Come on! Come on!

01:00.594 --> 01:02.895
(distant siren blaring)

01:06.367 --> 01:08.567
- Now I can't see anything.
- That's right.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.502
It's better than burning out
your retinas looking

01:10.504 --> 01:12.838
at the UVC rays.
- No fair.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.741
- This is a... good idea?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.843
- Uh...

01:17.845 --> 01:19.745
Well, we're about to find out.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.614
Fire in the hole!
(light bomb charging)

01:24.552 --> 01:27.286
(static boom)

01:28.889 --> 01:31.290
- You might want
to put that out.

01:35.863 --> 01:39.364
- What happened?
- In engineering terms, uh...

01:39.366 --> 01:41.467
you'd call that a fail.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.869
- An epic fail.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.771
- Well, light was strong
while it lasted.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.041
Was it long enough to hurt them?
- Could be bigger.

01:49.043 --> 01:51.043
- Need to keep the bulbs bright
enough to do the job without

01:51.045 --> 01:54.246
burning them out so fast.
- Well if it were me, I would

01:54.248 --> 01:56.081
make the lights
cycle on and off,

01:56.083 --> 01:58.617
strobe like a camera flash.
That might stop

01:58.619 --> 02:01.253
the bulbs from burning out.
- Huh.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.922
I could rig up a fog machine
too, you know, crank some tunes,

02:03.924 --> 02:06.925
really get 'em dancing.
Just boom, boom, boom.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.229
- Forget I mentioned it.
Do what you want.
- I'm just joking, Doc.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.232
Hmm?
(Fet mumbling)

02:13.234 --> 02:17.236
I'm not saying I disagree
because I do agree with you.

02:17.238 --> 02:21.073
Don't fall off
your high horse.

02:21.075 --> 02:23.075
Problem is, is that...

02:23.077 --> 02:25.077
well, we can't do
any more tests.

02:25.079 --> 02:28.747
I could put the rest
of our bulbs in...

02:28.749 --> 02:32.084
Tinker with the circuit board,
put in an oscillator...

02:32.086 --> 02:35.787
But we're gonna have to go
with what we end up with.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.823
Hope for the best.
- Mr. Fet,

02:37.825 --> 02:40.425
you've just described
my method of operation

02:40.427 --> 02:43.996
for the past six decades.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.204
(theme music)

03:04.852 --> 03:08.820
(clanking)
- Mama, what are you doing?!

03:08.822 --> 03:11.857
- I can't find anything
in this damn kitchen!

03:11.859 --> 03:14.393
(Mariela cries softly.)
- Apparently she's searching

03:14.395 --> 03:16.395
for an ashtray
she once owned

03:16.397 --> 03:18.897
from the Alvear Hotel,
Buenos Aires.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.467
- I know it's here somewhere.
(Nora sighs.)

03:22.469 --> 03:24.670
- Mama...

03:24.672 --> 03:28.807
that broke years ago. Hm?
(dog barking)

03:31.145 --> 03:35.814
I'll clean it up.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.917
This is not your kitchen.
(vehicles honking)

03:43.557 --> 03:47.392
- An ashtray here.
(helicopter whirring)

03:47.394 --> 03:49.528
- Thank you.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.396
- Ah.

03:54.835 --> 03:58.904
- I don't like him.
- Mr. Setrakian is our host.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.540
(sirens blaring outside)
- He has a dark soul.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.442
-<i> Mama, basta.</i>

04:03.444 --> 04:05.677
(translated from Spanish)

04:05.679 --> 04:08.747
(A man screams outside.)

04:10.918 --> 04:13.118
<i> Toma.</i>

04:19.193 --> 04:20.959
I'm sorry.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.894
- I understand what
she's experiencing.

04:22.896 --> 04:26.298
- She's wrong,
what she said about you.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.533
- No, she's not.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.736
(tires screeching)
(people yelling)

04:30.738 --> 04:32.871
- Is your mother going to be OK?

04:32.873 --> 04:35.941
- (Nora): She gets
confused sometimes.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.210
She mistakes memories
for reality.

04:38.212 --> 04:41.947
- She must have
really liked that ashtray.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.084
- It was from
a hotel-restaurant

04:46.086 --> 04:48.787
where my father took her
on their first date.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.423
He wanted a memento,
because he knew right then,

04:51.425 --> 04:54.893
from that first night,
that he was gonna marry her.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.263
- Well then, maybe it's good
that she still remembers it.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.899
- I think you're right.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.302
(car alarm system ringing)

05:10.511 --> 05:12.911
- Crispin, open the door.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.084
Crispin, open the damn door!
I'm not playing, bro!

05:19.086 --> 05:21.987
(soccer commentary
in Spanish on TV)

05:30.297 --> 05:32.531
Mama?

05:35.703 --> 05:38.070
(coughs)

05:55.222 --> 05:57.422
Where's Mom?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.827
Crispin, do you hear me?
Where is Mom?

06:01.829 --> 06:04.963
(growling)

06:13.474 --> 06:16.541
(growls and snarls)

06:21.315 --> 06:23.248
(screeching)

06:30.691 --> 06:34.126
(Gus panting)

06:36.730 --> 06:39.598
(Gus grunting)

06:39.600 --> 06:43.568
(crunching noises)

06:56.216 --> 06:57.783
NO!

06:57.785 --> 07:00.452
NO! NO!
(ambulance siren blaring)

07:06.293 --> 07:08.527
- First, do no harm.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.429
- Things have changed.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.364
- Have they?

07:12.366 --> 07:15.967
Take a remote village,
say 200 years ago.

07:15.969 --> 07:19.237
Residents are manifesting
strange symptoms.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.207
Dying, fear and
superstition rule the day,

07:22.209 --> 07:25.544
and a curse is blamed until
someone like you or me shows up

07:25.546 --> 07:28.380
and, through a scientific
process of elimination,

07:28.382 --> 07:32.284
traces the disease to a source
and destroys it.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.987
The curse is lifted.
People are saved.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.989
Order is restored.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.325
- So you believe now?

07:40.327 --> 07:43.395
If we slay the Master,
this plague of vampirism

07:43.397 --> 07:45.597
ends today?
- I have to believe it.

07:45.599 --> 07:49.067
Otherwise, I can't justify
leaving Zach here...

07:50.571 --> 07:52.471
...at the risk of...

07:52.473 --> 07:55.674
being orphaned or...

07:55.676 --> 07:57.509
worse.

07:57.511 --> 08:01.680
- We'll make it back here.
- What if we don't?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.587
Maybe one of us should stay.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.989
- You mean me?

08:13.961 --> 08:18.530
- I would never ask you that--
- You just did.

08:18.532 --> 08:21.099
The answer is no.
- I didn't mean it like that.

08:21.101 --> 08:26.037
- I'm leaving my mother behind.
- I know, I know you are.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.773
You and I are not assassins.

08:28.775 --> 08:32.143
Fet, that kill-happy
exterminator,

08:32.145 --> 08:34.145
this kamikaze mission
is his wet dream.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.715
And the old man is consumed
by an ancient grudge.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.985
No plan B, because they have
no one but themselves at risk.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.287
- I don't think
we have any other choice.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.456
(distant alarm system ringing)

08:47.628 --> 08:49.861
(people talking and yelling)
(alarm system ringing)

08:49.863 --> 08:52.063
(Nora talking indistinctly)

08:52.065 --> 08:54.466
(glass shattering)

09:14.087 --> 09:16.655
- This was the, uh...

09:16.657 --> 09:18.857
weapon Jim Kent chose to use.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.159
You would honor him
by taking it.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.829
- Thank you.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.432
(distant ambulance siren)

09:30.237 --> 09:33.004
- When will you be back?
- Sundown, absolute latest.

09:33.006 --> 09:36.341
- That's the whole day!
- Hopefully sooner.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.177
- What about Mom?
- I think the best thing is

09:39.179 --> 09:42.414
to, uh... take out that...

09:42.416 --> 09:45.417
the thing that's causing all
this. Mr. Setrakian has a plan.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.019
- I understand,
but why can't I come with you?

09:48.021 --> 09:51.289
- I don't know
what's out there. I...

09:51.291 --> 09:54.559
I can't control that
environment, but here...

09:54.561 --> 09:57.195
You've seen Mr. Setrakian's
basement, it's a fortress,

09:57.197 --> 09:59.230
it's an armory.
It's the most safe place

09:59.232 --> 10:01.866
I could imagine for you.
- You'll be careful, right?

10:01.868 --> 10:03.735
- Of course.

10:03.737 --> 10:07.072
I promise. In the meantime,
keep an eye on Mrs. Martinez.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.374
- Shouldn't that be
the other way around?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.076
- Should be.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.045
But you're in charge.
You stay in the basement.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.649
Both of you.
Don't let anybody see you.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.050
- OK.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.187
(siren blaring)
- (Fet): Time to go!

10:23.657 --> 10:25.824
- You're brave.

10:28.895 --> 10:31.296
(helicopter whirring)

10:50.250 --> 10:53.151
(vehicles honking)

10:56.490 --> 10:58.757
I love you.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.892
- I love you too.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.603
(The truck engine starts.)

11:35.562 --> 11:38.997
- ¶ Get up in the morning
slaving for bread, sir ¶

11:38.999 --> 11:42.333
¶ So that every mouth
can be fed ¶

11:42.335 --> 11:45.570
- ¶ Poor
- Poor, poor ¶

11:45.572 --> 11:47.472
¶ The Israelites ¶

11:47.474 --> 11:51.242
- Young boy!
Where is my ashtray?

11:51.244 --> 11:54.312
- I don't know, it's not here.
- What did you do with it?

11:54.314 --> 11:57.148
- I didn't put it anywhere. Nora
can help when she comes back.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.418
- ¶ Poor, the Israelites ¶

12:01.488 --> 12:04.823
¶ Shirt, they might tear up,
trousers are go ¶

12:04.825 --> 12:08.493
¶ I don't want to end up
like Bonnie and Clyde ¶

12:08.495 --> 12:11.696
- ¶ Poor
- Poor, poor ¶

12:11.698 --> 12:13.364
- ¶ The Israelites ¶

12:13.366 --> 12:15.166
- Wow!

12:15.168 --> 12:17.936
- ¶ After a storm
there must be a calm ¶

12:17.938 --> 12:21.172
¶ You catch me in the farm,
you sound your alarm ¶

12:21.174 --> 12:23.541
- ¶ Poor
- Poor, poor ¶

12:23.543 --> 12:26.111
¶ Poor, the Israelite ¶
- Where is my daughter?

12:26.113 --> 12:28.513
- She went out
with all the others.

12:28.515 --> 12:33.251
- Is she getting my cigarettes?
I need my cigarettes.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.622
See? I need cigarettes!

12:37.624 --> 12:41.292
- You shouldn't...
My mom says you shouldn't smoke.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.095
¶ In the morning,
slaving for bread, sir ¶

12:44.097 --> 12:45.563
Nora will get you some
when she comes back.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.799
- ¶ So that every mouth
can be fed ¶

12:47.801 --> 12:49.467
- ¶ Poor
- Poor, poor ¶

12:49.469 --> 12:53.138
¶ The Israelites, sir ¶

12:53.140 --> 12:55.540
¶ My wife and my kids... ¶

12:57.244 --> 12:59.544
(people yelling)

12:59.546 --> 13:03.414
- Let's haul ass! Come on!

13:03.416 --> 13:07.118
- Everybody's having fun now.
- Every man for himself.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.054
That's what the Master
is counting on.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.490
(glass shattering)
(alarm ringing)

13:12.492 --> 13:16.227
(people talking and yelling)

13:16.229 --> 13:19.464
- Run! Run! Run! Run!

13:24.104 --> 13:26.838
(phone ringing)
(Spanish TV program playing)

13:26.840 --> 13:29.741
- C'mon, Mama, pick up.
(siren blaring outside)

13:29.743 --> 13:32.644
(truck honking)
Pick up, mama, please.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.514
(Beep!)

13:46.193 --> 13:48.760
(dialing)

13:50.463 --> 13:53.331
(ringing)
- (woman):<i> Thank you for calling</i>

13:53.333 --> 13:54.766
<i> Harlem's Hospital Center.</i>

13:54.768 --> 13:56.267
<i> If you know</i>
<i> your party's extension...</i>

13:56.269 --> 13:58.503
(dialing)
(ringing)

13:58.505 --> 14:00.939
- woman: [Nurse's desk, 4B]
- Yeah, can I speak

14:00.941 --> 14:04.042
to Guadalupe Elizalde, please?
It's an emergency.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.111
- [May I ask who's calling?]
- It's Augustine Elizalde,

14:07.113 --> 14:09.147
her son.
- [Yeah, hold on.]

14:09.149 --> 14:11.616
- OK.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.786
- [Mr. Elizalde, Guadalupe's
shift isn't till 6pm.]

14:14.788 --> 14:16.788
[It's totally crazy here. She
might have called in earlier,]

14:16.790 --> 14:19.624
[come in early, I don't know.
But I haven't seen her.]

14:19.626 --> 14:22.293
- OK. Thank you.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.729
(brief thumping)

14:30.871 --> 14:33.538
(ambulance siren blaring)

14:44.317 --> 14:46.818
(vehicles honking frantically)

15:00.433 --> 15:03.101
(Gus gasps.)
(Guadalupe growling)

15:05.872 --> 15:09.607
(crying)

15:13.246 --> 15:15.179
(Guadalupe growling)

15:15.181 --> 15:17.815
(Gus sobbing)

15:25.725 --> 15:28.126
(Gus sobbing)

15:33.633 --> 15:37.268
- (Mariela): Somebody please!
Help me!

15:37.270 --> 15:40.705
I need to get out of here!

15:40.707 --> 15:43.107
Help!

15:44.978 --> 15:48.780
It's locked! Help me, please!

15:51.051 --> 15:54.886
(crying): Help me!

15:54.888 --> 15:56.721
Please.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.757
(vehicles honking frantically)

15:59.759 --> 16:01.559
- Mrs. Martinez!

16:01.561 --> 16:04.062
- Oh, there you are,
young boy.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.931
The keys! Give me the keys.

16:06.933 --> 16:10.902
- My dad gave me the keys. Do
you want to go back downstairs?

16:10.904 --> 16:13.571
- My daughter, my Nora,

16:13.573 --> 16:16.641
they've taken her.
I must go to her!

16:16.643 --> 16:18.977
- No, she left on her own.
She's coming back.

16:18.979 --> 16:23.314
They're all coming back!
- They never come back! Never!

16:23.316 --> 16:26.150
(Mariela crying)
(glass shattering)

16:27.954 --> 16:30.421
We must leave this place!

16:30.423 --> 16:31.923
Please!

16:31.925 --> 16:33.758
I need to get out of here!
- If I...

16:33.760 --> 16:35.760
If I go get you cigarettes,

16:35.762 --> 16:38.463
will you go downstairs
and wait for me?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.999
(vehicles honking)

16:55.782 --> 16:57.782
- (Ephraim):
Why the World Trade Center?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.817
- (Setrakian): The Master
is drawn to places

16:59.819 --> 17:03.054
of great human misery.
He seeks out suffering.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.858
<i> - Eau de strigoi.</i>

17:06.860 --> 17:09.527
I think
we're in the right place.

17:11.798 --> 17:16.367
- (Setrakian): "The cave
you fear to enter...

17:16.369 --> 17:19.871
- (Ephraim): Holds the treasure
that you seek."

17:30.417 --> 17:32.583
- Oh, God!

17:32.585 --> 17:34.986
- With any luck,
Dr. Martinez,

17:34.988 --> 17:38.156
it's gonna get a hell of a lot
messier than this.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.787
- Stay to the right!

18:43.957 --> 18:46.457
The third rail.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.459
I don't know if it's live

18:48.461 --> 18:50.128
down here, but, uh...

18:50.130 --> 18:53.798
that's 625 volts;
we don't want to find out.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.418
- It's everything
that defined these people.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.254
- Well, I hope I'm defined

19:16.256 --> 19:19.624
by more than just my wallet
and my wristwatch.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.792
- Everything you see represents
somebody's mother,

19:21.794 --> 19:24.929
father, son, daughter.
- Don't bother.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.177
(people screaming and yelling)
(vehicles honking)

19:43.349 --> 19:45.149
(baby crying)

19:45.151 --> 19:48.019
(gun firing)
(ambulance siren blaring)

19:49.622 --> 19:52.056
(tires screeching)

19:54.227 --> 19:56.694
- (woman on police radio):
<i> Following either a gray Ford </i>

19:56.696 --> 19:59.163
<i> or a Plymouth...</i>
(woman weeping)

19:59.165 --> 20:01.699
<i> We're looking at two male</i>
<i> Caucasians moving south...</i>

20:01.701 --> 20:03.668
(loud clattering)

20:03.670 --> 20:05.536
(man screaming)

20:05.538 --> 20:07.872
- Hey!

20:07.874 --> 20:09.974
Does your phone work?
Can you get a signal?

20:09.976 --> 20:13.211
- No, mine
doesn't work either.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.452
- No more graffiti.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.389
- The station was
abandoned after 9/11...

20:26.726 --> 20:28.726
Doubt anyone's
been here since.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.763
Anyone still human that is.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.073
(vampires growling)

21:04.197 --> 21:06.464
- They're nesting.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.533
- During daylight hours, always.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.702
Especially when first turned.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.871
The, uh, transformation,

21:13.873 --> 21:16.707
it exhausts them.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.610
- That's a lot
of necks to chop.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.212
- No.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.047
Releasing them...

21:23.049 --> 21:26.617
would alert the Master
to our presence. Switch off.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.320
(clicking)
(vampires growling)

21:54.447 --> 21:56.314
- Kelly?

22:04.023 --> 22:07.858
- (Nora): Eph, it's not her.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.030
- We must keep moving.

22:25.478 --> 22:28.179
(low growling)

22:40.626 --> 22:43.027
- I should have been there
for you, Mama.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.468
(siren blaring outside)

22:50.470 --> 22:53.204
(growling)

23:14.494 --> 23:16.761
(snarling)

23:16.763 --> 23:18.996
- Mr. Farrell...

23:18.998 --> 23:21.399
you're here for the rent,<i> puto?</i>

23:22.101 --> 23:23.601
(growling)

23:26.239 --> 23:29.540
- Look. The rails
are clean here.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.742
- Ah, service cars.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.613
They use the abandoned stations
for turnarounds.

23:37.183 --> 23:40.584
I know these tunnels like the
back of my hand. Now, this line

23:40.586 --> 23:44.188
was built on top
of the old original

23:44.190 --> 23:46.357
1923 line.

23:46.359 --> 23:48.125
Yeah, it's like, uh...

23:48.127 --> 23:50.261
ancient Rome
or the City of David.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.396
(distant screeching noises)
- Shhh!

23:52.398 --> 23:56.634
- We were hearing that
the whole time, Doc.

23:56.636 --> 24:00.037
- No, no, this is different.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.772
- These tunnels, they do

24:01.774 --> 24:04.475
strange things to sounds. You
know, like whispering chambers.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.243
You know?

24:06.245 --> 24:09.213
If there's a train coming,
we're gonna know it, OK?

24:09.215 --> 24:12.283
Come on.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.955
- (Nora): GO!
- RUN!

24:25.731 --> 24:28.032
- You were saying?

24:32.405 --> 24:34.271
- "I know these tunnels
like the back of my hand."

24:34.273 --> 24:36.140
For future reference,
that's the back of your hand.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.908
That's your ass.
That's your elbow.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.410
- You want to take lead, yeah?

24:39.412 --> 24:42.246
Take point? Then go ahead.
Be my guest. Go for it, Doc.

24:42.248 --> 24:45.249
- I'm sick of this
Brooklyn-pride shit.
Save it for somebody who cares.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.785
- You're used to having
the last word, huh, Doc?

24:47.787 --> 24:50.254
How does it feel to know
that a pawnbroker

24:50.256 --> 24:52.523
and a rat killer
know more than you do, huh?

24:52.525 --> 24:54.758
- You've been waiting for this
your whole life, haven't you?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.760
Congratulations
on the vampire apocalypse.

24:56.762 --> 24:59.163
- The first will be last.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.599
The last shall be first, Doc.
- Enough!

25:01.601 --> 25:04.602
Both of you! Pay attention!

25:09.275 --> 25:11.375
(weird growling)

25:20.786 --> 25:22.620
We cannot afford to be seen.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.855
Not yet.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.359
(weird growling)

25:36.802 --> 25:39.737
- It's a shitty way
to go, even for them.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.341
Now, I know another way
to kill them.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.377
- Next outing,
you carry the power transformer.

25:46.379 --> 25:50.714
- She was heading this way,
so we're close.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.284
- Just be careful.

25:54.887 --> 25:58.188
- (radio):<i> ...they'll get any</i>
<i> better. Widespread looting.</i>

25:58.190 --> 26:00.925
<i> Emergency services stretched.</i>
- Hello?

26:00.927 --> 26:04.328
<i> - Infrastructure's crumbling,</i>
<i> and there are serious concerns</i>

26:04.330 --> 26:07.331
<i> that hydro and water services</i>
<i> are in imminent danger</i>

26:07.333 --> 26:10.167
<i> of collapse. Added to that,</i>
<i> last night's events,</i>

26:10.169 --> 26:13.537
<i> on the George Washington's</i>
<i> bridge particularly,</i>

26:13.539 --> 26:16.106
<i> has sparked concerns over</i>
<i> a recent wave of vigilantism</i>

26:16.108 --> 26:18.409
<i> that has spread panic over</i>
<i> law-abiding citizens.</i>

26:18.411 --> 26:20.878
<i> And many citizens have</i>
<i> actually decided to pull up</i>

26:20.880 --> 26:23.914
<i> stakes and get out of town.</i>
<i> We have one such gentleman</i>

26:23.916 --> 26:26.016
<i> on the line right now...</i>

26:26.018 --> 26:28.018
(woman and man laughing)

26:28.020 --> 26:31.055
- (man): Ohhh, jackpot!

26:31.057 --> 26:33.023
- Sloppy seconds
is more like it.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.426
(tires screeching)
But food's food.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.895
Check the cash register
just in case.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.598
And grab another bag to fill.
We'll trade what we can't eat.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.701
We might not find
another store like this again.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.202
- Ohhh... Damn!

26:45.204 --> 26:48.606
Hey, Val, the clerk, he, uh...

26:48.608 --> 26:50.975
- Don't be such a pussy.
You want to eat, don't you?

26:50.977 --> 26:53.844
Check the backroom,
look for canned tuna.

27:04.557 --> 27:08.125
(strange growling)

27:10.896 --> 27:13.664
(clattering)

27:15.134 --> 27:17.868
(vampire growling)

27:59.445 --> 28:01.445
- Oh, Jesus! Hey!
- Let go of me!

28:01.447 --> 28:04.682
- What are you doing here, kid?
Hey, Val!

28:07.453 --> 28:10.654
- (Belle): Where did you
come from, kid?

28:10.656 --> 28:12.389
- (man): Hey, uh...

28:12.391 --> 28:14.958
somebody else here.
(growling)

28:14.960 --> 28:17.294
(man screaming)
(clatter)

28:18.864 --> 28:20.864
(Belle screaming)

28:20.866 --> 28:22.366
(loud clatter)

28:22.368 --> 28:25.069
- Hey, watch it, kid.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.638
(vampire snarling)
(body thumping)

28:27.640 --> 28:30.574
(glass breaking)

28:30.576 --> 28:32.142
Vamoose.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.678
(vampire growling)

28:34.680 --> 28:36.880
(ambulance siren blaring)

28:42.555 --> 28:45.322
(vampire growling)

28:50.830 --> 28:53.230
(vampire growling)

29:06.846 --> 29:08.846
- (Ephraim): Dead-end.
- (Fet): What the hell?

29:08.848 --> 29:12.850
- Where did all the vamps go?
Where'd they...

29:12.852 --> 29:15.252
How'd they get through?

29:25.064 --> 29:28.232
- If I were hunting rats,

29:28.234 --> 29:30.701
this is exactly
where I'd assume they'd go.

29:30.703 --> 29:32.269
- Or if this is a trap.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.605
- Goddamn it!

29:53.159 --> 29:55.692
(panting)

30:38.971 --> 30:41.705
- All clear.
(vampires growling)

30:41.707 --> 30:43.941
- Shit. Behind us.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.943
- Go.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.312
Hurry. I'll hold them off.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.314
- He knows we're here now.

30:50.316 --> 30:54.017
- Oh well, all the more reason
to hurry.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.859
(panting)

31:11.804 --> 31:13.871
- (woman): Eph?

31:15.674 --> 31:17.374
Eph?

31:17.376 --> 31:20.377
(panting)
- Doctor!

31:20.379 --> 31:23.247
- (woman): Eph, are you there?

31:23.249 --> 31:25.382
- Give me a hand.

31:27.152 --> 31:28.418
Dr. Goodweather!

31:28.420 --> 31:31.855
- (woman): I'm so cold.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.057
Find me, Eph, I need you.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.326
- (Eph): Kelly?
- Don't!

31:36.328 --> 31:39.730
Listen to me!
- (Kelly): Don't
let them hurt me.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.865
- Doctor!

31:41.867 --> 31:43.667
No!

31:45.271 --> 31:47.738
Listen to me!

31:52.378 --> 31:54.678
(Setrakian): Doctor!
- (Nora): Something's happening.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.915
- Holding them off with the
light isn't gonna get it done.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.953
(growling and screeching)

32:06.692 --> 32:08.592
Go! Go now!

32:08.594 --> 32:10.661
Go!

32:14.633 --> 32:16.934
- Eph!

32:25.744 --> 32:28.679
(low growling)

32:36.922 --> 32:38.121
Eph!

32:38.123 --> 32:40.791
(growling)

32:42.661 --> 32:45.062
Eph?

32:45.064 --> 32:46.964
(growling)

32:50.836 --> 32:53.036
(grunting)

33:07.920 --> 33:10.487
(strange growling)

33:12.091 --> 33:15.559
- Gah! GAAAH!

33:21.100 --> 33:22.933
Gah!

33:22.935 --> 33:26.003
Ah! I'm stuck!
- (Nora): Go! Go!

33:31.477 --> 33:33.543
- (Fet): AAAH!

33:33.545 --> 33:36.446
(vampire growling and snarling)

33:36.448 --> 33:40.517
(vampire screeching in pain)

33:43.322 --> 33:45.689
(vampire screeching)

33:49.561 --> 33:52.195
- Where are they?

33:55.134 --> 33:57.267
- Let's go.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.645
- (Kelly): Eph?

34:33.505 --> 34:37.741
(grunting)

34:41.580 --> 34:45.082
Eph, where are you? Hurry.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.850
- Kelly, I'm here.

34:46.852 --> 34:50.253
(growling)

34:56.762 --> 35:00.530
WHERE IS SHE?
Goddamn it, come on!

35:00.532 --> 35:03.100
What are you waiting for?!
Come on!

35:03.102 --> 35:06.103
(growling)

35:21.220 --> 35:22.552
AAAH!

35:22.554 --> 35:24.287
(cracking sound)

35:24.289 --> 35:25.922
Ugh! Ugh!

35:25.924 --> 35:28.558
(low growling)

35:28.560 --> 35:30.560
(gunshot)
(Eph choking)

35:30.562 --> 35:35.232
- Have you come here
to destroy me?

35:37.302 --> 35:40.103
The old professor...

35:40.105 --> 35:42.305
has a new pupil...

35:44.576 --> 35:48.745
...to fail... as he failed.

35:50.282 --> 35:54.251
I have taken everything

35:54.253 --> 35:56.520
from him.

35:56.522 --> 35:59.256
And I...

35:59.258 --> 36:02.092
will take everything...

36:02.094 --> 36:03.860
from you.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.265
Your wife...

36:08.267 --> 36:10.367
your son.

36:12.037 --> 36:14.538
I...

36:14.540 --> 36:18.175
am a drinker of men.

36:27.452 --> 36:28.919
<i> Professore.</i>

36:40.799 --> 36:42.933
(light bomb charging)

36:46.171 --> 36:48.872
(vampires screaming)

36:56.415 --> 36:58.848
- Mrs. Martinez!

36:58.850 --> 37:01.384
(song in Spanish
playing softly)

37:03.155 --> 37:05.288
Mrs. Martinez?

37:09.061 --> 37:11.161
Mrs. Martinez?

37:18.403 --> 37:20.804
Mrs. Martinez?

37:23.442 --> 37:25.508
I got your cigarettes.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.912
- Oh, thank you!

37:33.518 --> 37:35.952
Sweet young boy.

37:39.524 --> 37:42.325
(song in Spanish
continues playing)

37:59.544 --> 38:03.046
(sniffling)

38:03.048 --> 38:06.950
- Did anyone see?
Which way did he go?

38:06.952 --> 38:09.753
Which path?
- (Nora): Eph.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.622
- We had him.
- No, he had us.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.557
Are you OK?

38:14.559 --> 38:16.826
- I think so.

38:16.828 --> 38:20.163
You saw him?
- Yeah, I saw him.

38:20.165 --> 38:23.166
- I heard her voice.

38:23.168 --> 38:25.502
Kelly.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.271
She was calling out to me.

38:28.273 --> 38:31.741
He tricked me.
- Of course, he tricked you!

38:31.743 --> 38:33.843
- How could you
run off like that?

38:33.845 --> 38:37.447
Hmm? We ended up hunting for you
instead of that thing!

38:37.449 --> 38:40.917
- WHY DID YOU IGNITE THE
LIGHT BOMB? IT CHASED HIM AWAY!

38:40.919 --> 38:42.852
- We had no choice!
- HE WAS RIGHT THERE!

38:42.854 --> 38:46.189
RIGHT WITHIN MY GRASP! NOW GONE!

38:51.330 --> 38:54.831
I'll not rest
until the Master is destroyed!

38:54.833 --> 38:57.934
And now, neither will he!

38:59.938 --> 39:04.174
I'll break you, you...

39:04.176 --> 39:06.343
<i> strigoi!</i>

39:06.345 --> 39:09.212
Kill you! Die, you!

39:09.214 --> 39:12.182
Die,<i> strigoi!</i>

39:12.184 --> 39:14.250
(yells)

39:22.561 --> 39:25.028
This way!

39:29.234 --> 39:31.167
- How did you know
he went this way?

39:31.169 --> 39:33.670
- The Master is
here somewhere.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.206
- We should think
this out, regroup.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.808
- And let them regroup?
Why would we do that?

39:38.810 --> 39:41.378
We may never
get this chance again.

39:54.693 --> 39:58.728
GODDAMN IT!
- Tough choice here, huh?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.830
- That's basically
a random choice.

40:00.832 --> 40:01.831
- No.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.033
- Whoa, look...
I get it,

40:04.035 --> 40:06.069
I'm on your side,
but this is crazy.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.337
- We've got him on the run!

40:07.339 --> 40:09.038
We must press on!
Do what you like!

40:09.040 --> 40:11.241
- Stop!
- Hold on!

40:11.243 --> 40:13.443
Flashlights off.

40:13.445 --> 40:15.211
UV only.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.414
Huh?

40:19.684 --> 40:21.751
- You see?

40:21.753 --> 40:24.521
I was right! Now, let me go!

40:24.523 --> 40:27.857
- Stop! Wait. Nora.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.093
- What are we waiting for?

40:36.902 --> 40:39.636
(growling)

40:49.614 --> 40:53.049
- That's a lot of monsters.

40:54.386 --> 40:56.386
No way, Pops!

40:56.388 --> 40:58.254
- He is here! Unhand me!

40:58.256 --> 41:00.323
- For God's sake,
this is suicide!

41:00.325 --> 41:03.393
- No! No! No! No!
