WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.630
<i>It's clear, little buddy.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:09.259
<i>They won't stop there. No, sir.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.303
Smoke us out.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.139
Massacre the lot.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.187
You stay strong. Yeah.

00:29.655 --> 00:33.325
<i>There ain't no law in the stars but me.</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:43.836
<i>The Gargon invasion
continued its merciless pace,</i>

00:43.836 --> 00:47.589
<i>but would be no match
for our intrepid Space Sheriff.</i>

02:02.706 --> 02:03.874
- Sir.
- Thanks.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.173
- Here's to new frontiers.
- Ma'am.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.263
Big days for us right now.
Breakneck growth.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.806
You picked the right time
to pay attention.

02:19.806 --> 02:25.062
You know why I prefer this to dining out?
I can't stomach the desperation.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.524
Everyone lined up at the trough,
filling the hole.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.903
Except, of course, I'm desperate.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.323
And so are you.
Otherwise, why didn't we stay at home?

02:37.324 --> 02:42.079
All right. What if I wanted 200 units
with an option for that many more?

02:42.079 --> 02:44.540
Just something to play with.

02:50.671 --> 02:55.259
Well, we're not looking twice
at anything less than 1,000.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.635
What are you, broke?

02:58.262 --> 03:01.431
Let's take Mr. Billings
back to his motel, Sidney.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.396
Now, look.
I know you're not in it for the money.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.732
You got way too much style
for someone who sweats the numbers.

03:12.526 --> 03:16.280
No, I don't think money
does a damn thing for you.

03:17.030 --> 03:23.453
Because you are not in it to get ahead.
You are in it to get away with something.

03:24.746 --> 03:31.712
Which is why you would love the moon.

03:33.172 --> 03:37.718
All that empty space just waiting
for someone to work its upside.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.847
Well, I have wondered
just how empty it is.

03:44.683 --> 03:49.771
It's like when the magician
pulls the rabbit out of the hat.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.858
Only there's no hat.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.571
And there's no rabbit.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.951
That's quite a trick.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.542
What if you hit your ceiling
selling those saps at the club?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.044
That's moving one house at a time.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.005
And why be in the business of houses
when we, you and I--

04:15.005 --> 04:17.216
We could be in the business of belief?

04:17.216 --> 04:21.845
Say you knew some bigger saps
who wanted to buy in at scale.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.559
All right, so I go in first
to make you look respectable.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.063
And you got me to throw under the bus
if it all goes south.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.607
And you expect a check tonight?

04:37.528 --> 04:40.822
Well, now we're pals...

04:45.285 --> 04:46.703
I give you till tomorrow.

04:50.249 --> 04:53.961
It's quite a lot of faith
you're asking, Jack.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.965
Isn't that how you blow a bubble?

05:34.293 --> 05:37.921
Good evening, guest. Would you
like me to assist you with transportation?

05:41.091 --> 05:43.385
Every name, every customer ever.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.220
Ready for the truth.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.891
How did you--

05:52.686 --> 05:58.692
I just asked them, and they gave it to me.
What idiots, huh?

06:03.113 --> 06:05.657
I love this song. Don't you?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.373
"Beaufitul."

06:17.920 --> 06:18.921
Hi, Mom.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.467
I know I haven't been around
enough lately,

06:23.467 --> 06:25.260
and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.359
"Head out of the clouds, Joseph.
Head out of the clouds."

06:44.488 --> 06:46.406
Only this time,
you weren't around to say it,

06:46.406 --> 06:48.909
and I was too dumb to remember.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.788
I did everything wrong, Mom.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.168
So I take it all back
about how much he taught me.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
Now I just wish that I never met him.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.390
Mr. Shorter?

07:12.558 --> 07:15.018
Fantastic. I was hoping to see you.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.312
Yeah, sorry. I've been--

07:17.312 --> 07:19.231
Of course. Take a minute.

07:19.731 --> 07:24.862
I was also hoping to discuss
a past-due balance on your mom's care.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.364
Right.

07:27.364 --> 07:30.826
We do have payment plans
that might work for your situation.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.911
All we need is proof of employment.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.333
Right.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.172
Why, Ma?
Why did you have to bring him here?

07:43.172 --> 07:46.341
What? Did I intrude
on your perfect relationship?

07:46.341 --> 07:50.929
Don't you dare think that I don't
always have your best interests in mind.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.014
And Joey's too.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.975
You think it's easy
managing a whole family?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.521
That scares me, sweetheart.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.523
Please.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.025
Just cuddle up with your bottle

08:03.025 --> 08:05.527
and keep clear
before you fuck anything else up!

08:05.527 --> 08:07.029
Got it?

08:07.571 --> 08:08.572
Jesus.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.450
Sorry.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.538
Fucking ViddiCon.

08:17.664 --> 08:22.294
So, you're selling your father's
worthless land on the moon.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.962
Not worthless anymore, Ma.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.925
And what then? Walt launches
the rockets just like Dad?

08:27.925 --> 08:30.427
That's been the plan,
and now I got enough money to do it.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.013
Everything's going great. You think
you can find a way to deal with that?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.390
You still owe your boy the truth.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.809
Hey, I'm gonna tell him as soon as I
get the whole business up and running.

08:38.809 --> 08:42.313
- Oh, Jacky. Not that.
- What?

08:42.313 --> 08:45.776
So he has a father he can look up to.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.532
And what is wrong with that?

08:51.532 --> 08:53.909
It's asking too much. I worry.

08:54.743 --> 08:58.413
Please. God, another day,
another goddamn apocalypse.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.998
Take a look next door.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.544
That idiot face of your company
has broken loose again.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.046
That can't be great for business!

09:25.232 --> 09:26.608
Gargon scum!

09:27.234 --> 09:29.403
Come grab a scoop of hurt!

09:30.571 --> 09:36.159
Error. Error. Malfunction.
Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfu--

09:38.203 --> 09:41.623
Eyes to the skies, little one.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.960
We got a heap of freedom left to kill for.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.844
The neighborhood is safe.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.472
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.725
Wow. Celebrating good news?

09:59.725 --> 10:01.018
Yes.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.020
I'm here to talk to Jack.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.355
You'll have to find him first.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.316
What I'm planning on telling him is,

10:07.316 --> 10:09.693
while I'm team-first all the way,

10:09.693 --> 10:12.613
it's also a leader's place
to flag injustice

10:12.613 --> 10:15.657
in terms of promotions
given without merit. Joey's, for example.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.202
Not today, Herb.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.578
Look at these two.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.747
What, you never seen money before,
Shirley?

10:21.747 --> 10:22.915
I thought you loved money.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.459
Now thanks to you,
I got bags and bags of it.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.127
Poor bastard.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.463
Here you go, pal.
That should be a couple hundred there.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.340
Fire the tube up. Game's on in ten.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.636
Yeah, just a very well-funded man
enjoying the fruits of my finances,

10:35.636 --> 10:38.222
unburdened by petty affairs
of the heart, huh?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.599
I'm going to work.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.018
Hey, what better refuge from life, huh?

10:43.018 --> 10:45.479
Meaningless obligations
to corporate masters

10:45.479 --> 10:47.523
on another fucking celestial object.

10:47.523 --> 10:52.569
To think, you had a winner like me.
You botched it, baby.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.197
Shirley, it's actually pretty urgent,
my message for Jack.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.616
There's a few more problems
in the world today besides yours, Herb.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.827
I guess you've never discovered
your unborn sons weren't actually there.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.887
You too? What's up, kid?

11:19.805 --> 11:21.682
I need my commissions
for last week, Shirl.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.684
What happened?

11:24.226 --> 11:26.770
Think you can help me out?
And give these back to Jack.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.107
You say that like
you'll never see us again.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.359
Yeah. No, I'm done.

11:32.985 --> 11:37.281
Look, if I know one thing,
I know that Jack cares about you.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.867
Come on, Shirley,
you're too smart for his bullshit.

11:42.077 --> 11:45.080
I mean, hey, it's your life,
but I'd get out while you can.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.007
Hey. We're gonna work this all out, Joey.

11:55.799 --> 11:56.800
For everybody.

11:57.342 --> 12:01.471
But we can't do that if we don't
all keep quiet in the meantime.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.351
Right. Yeah, he said that.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.030
Bye, Herb.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.531
Bye, Joey.

12:19.531 --> 12:22.659
And my sincere congratulations
on your new promotion.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.454
No, Herb. I'm done. I quit.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.123
But I'll see you around.

12:32.211 --> 12:35.380
We were each other's fires
that forged us and made us strong.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.302
Burn bright always.

12:46.225 --> 12:48.852
These people don't care about you.
Trust me.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.563
I've dug deep, and there's no proof
they're ever getting anyone up there.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.982
<i>It's just--</i>

12:53.982 --> 12:59.196
<i>He wouldn't pull something like that
on us. He's a good man, Jack.</i>

12:59.988 --> 13:03.242
I was shocked too, sir.
But look at the world.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.203
Who gets anywhere by playing straight?

13:08.622 --> 13:09.706
<i>Christ Almighty.</i>

13:11.124 --> 13:15.295
I know, right?
Thanks for your time, mister.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.381
Mrs. Mayburn?

13:21.969 --> 13:23.178
Get in here.

13:26.390 --> 13:33.313
I thought to expect you at the office
to process our, the new "edivence."

13:33.313 --> 13:34.731
But did you really...

13:36.316 --> 13:37.943
when it's stolen evidence?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.529
Let's not spend all day
in the doorway, huh?

13:42.573 --> 13:43.574
I--

13:44.449 --> 13:51.039
I "wodner" what my proper role might be
in whatever plan you're pursuing, if any.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.376
We're just telling people the truth.
It's that easy.

13:54.918 --> 13:58.547
Look, everyone's had
their launches pushed back.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.592
And they all just take it,
like they deserve to get screwed.

14:03.844 --> 14:08.807
Customers do "frequeltny" redirect
the market's callousness onto themselves

14:09.683 --> 14:11.643
as feelings of unworthiness.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.857
Lester, you know you get to
bend a couple rules

14:16.857 --> 14:18.859
when you're doing what's right.

14:19.776 --> 14:20.777
That's how it works.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.573
So come on, who's next?

14:28.493 --> 14:32.748
"Wilbur Hartoonian. Vista-53472."

14:33.248 --> 14:35.751
And listen,
if their whole business blows up

14:35.751 --> 14:37.002
and those bastards fry...

14:37.920 --> 14:39.338
oops, right?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.553
Can I help you?

14:49.932 --> 14:51.308
You know him?

14:52.476 --> 14:53.477
I don't know you.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.603
He your boss?

14:55.437 --> 14:57.356
You're good at questions, mister.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.900
Mrs. Selwyn says
she's got her own pen, actually,

15:00.400 --> 15:03.654
but she's not quite ready to use it
after she saw the news this morning.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.948
What does that mean?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.616
Who's doing questions now?

15:09.576 --> 15:10.744
Was she ready to buy?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.663
She was.

15:13.330 --> 15:17.709
Between us, I think he went way high.
Decent operator, that guy.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.632
Too bad about the news.

15:32.558 --> 15:35.143
Hey! I don't appreciate
such belligerent flirting,

15:35.143 --> 15:36.311
even from you.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.731
<i>...Manzell's fourth attack
on automated domestic aids.</i>

15:39.731 --> 15:42.276
<i>I'm here with little Denny,
the sole eyewitness.</i>

15:42.276 --> 15:43.694
<i>Tell us what you saw, kid.</i>

15:44.278 --> 15:46.989
<i>It was the Space Sheriff! I saw him.</i>

15:46.989 --> 15:48.323
<i>What an imagination.</i>

15:48.323 --> 15:50.868
<i>I think he's probably
happily retired somewhere,</i>

15:50.868 --> 15:52.953
<i>getting a good chuckle from all this.</i>

15:52.953 --> 15:53.871
<i>Back to you, Robert.</i>

15:53.871 --> 15:56.832
<i>Well, now the suspect
is reportedly at large and may be armed.</i>

15:56.832 --> 15:57.916
Is that--

15:57.916 --> 15:59.251
Christ, no.

15:59.251 --> 16:03.505
But it's a great disguise to go around
acting like a lunatic. Grow up, Ed.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.133
I'm fully grown, Shirl.
I'm goddamn retired!

16:06.133 --> 16:07.718
What's more grown than that?

16:09.303 --> 16:10.596
- Shirley.
- What?

16:11.180 --> 16:12.514
This is Mr. Mason,

16:12.514 --> 16:15.392
Lot A-1, our very first customer.

16:15.392 --> 16:19.938
He just arrived with his beautiful family,
looking for Jack.

16:19.938 --> 16:23.525
Yeah, great, Herb. You deal with it.
And run the office while you're at it.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.948
No such thing as too much responsibility.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.702
I think Mr. Walter's bringing in
a rocket for y'all tonight.

16:33.702 --> 16:34.995
That's why he cleared us out.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.883
Welcome, sir. How can I help you?

16:47.883 --> 16:49.593
Is Mr. Hartoonian around?

16:49.593 --> 16:51.762
I think he's busy, but I'm happy to help.

16:52.804 --> 16:53.805
Right, of course.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.642
Well, can you tell him that
Joey's here? Joey Shorter.

16:56.642 --> 17:00.812
I thought I heard your voice.
I want to talk to you, young man.

17:01.522 --> 17:04.942
Hey, Boss. Hey. It's great to see you.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.569
Why am I getting calls saying
I'm never going to the moon?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.446
And that you and your fancy friends

17:10.446 --> 17:13.367
are nothing but a bunch
of low-life crooks? Huh?

17:13.867 --> 17:19.748
I don't exactly know,
but, you know, I quit that job.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.166
I got the feeling
that something wasn't right.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.294
You could've told anybody that!

17:25.170 --> 17:26.380
I'm sorry.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.757
You know, time's have been tough, and--

17:30.133 --> 17:33.178
My ma still isn't doing so great,
and I'm a little behind on her bills.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.681
No. You stop right there
if this looking for a handout.

17:35.681 --> 17:38.851
No. I was just thinking
maybe if you had a couple shifts

17:38.851 --> 17:41.103
that maybe I could pick up here
and there, I wouldn't mind.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.189
Here I'm scraping for payments
on that goddamn moon house,

17:44.189 --> 17:46.316
and he's here looking for a handout.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.652
You got a lot of nerve, Joseph.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.906
I guess I better go.

17:53.657 --> 17:54.908
I guess you better.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.292
Excuse me.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.503
Don't tell me, you saw it too?

18:06.503 --> 18:07.588
Don't worry.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.840
- No one thinks it's really him. Not yet.
- Okay.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.675
Well, I-- Do you?

18:11.675 --> 18:13.677
I know he's not on the goddamn moon.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.930
Nothing kills a deal
like your spokesman being arrested

18:16.930 --> 18:18.849
on the wrong goddamn planet.

18:18.849 --> 18:21.351
Yeah. She said the same thing.

18:24.855 --> 18:27.816
Shit. I gotta find him.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.903
- She was in, Shirl.
- And you weren't even gonna tell me?

18:30.903 --> 18:32.654
No, I had to come straight here first.

18:33.030 --> 18:35.824
And the cop just told me
that he got a call out on Route 18.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.618
- I'm gonna go check that.
- I'll ride with you.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.328
No, you don't have to worry about that, okay?

18:39.328 --> 18:41.079
It's probably just some half goose chase.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.706
How big was her deal, Jack?

18:42.706 --> 18:45.459
Well, it was just like I said.
Enough to pay everybody back

18:45.459 --> 18:48.003
and, you know,
a little something for us for our trouble.

18:54.510 --> 18:55.844
A thousand.

18:57.846 --> 19:02.768
If that's not the dumbest
fucking bit of behavior.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.146
All right, I'll keep your half.
Where are you going?

19:06.146 --> 19:10.067
No, I'll take half. Now give me your keys
and get in.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.118
You gotta be kidding me.

19:21.078 --> 19:23.497
Well, I haven't heard
from Jack in over a week.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.592
One day I think I'll be bringing Marvin

19:35.592 --> 19:37.719
his scotch and slippers
until the day I die,

19:37.719 --> 19:40.389
and now... look at us.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.102
They do say life is "undeprictable."

19:46.144 --> 19:47.855
You're a good man, Lester.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.940
You care about people.

19:50.691 --> 19:52.818
All the other guys
just nod their dumb heads

19:52.818 --> 19:54.361
and wait for the clothes to come off.

19:56.488 --> 19:57.990
We've really done something here.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.372
Well, we just gotta talk to Jack.

20:06.582 --> 20:07.791
He'll clear all this up.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.670
What's a few months, this way or that?

20:11.670 --> 20:13.547
As long as we all get up there, right?

20:13.547 --> 20:16.967
A few months? I could have
a carcinoma by then.

20:20.053 --> 20:24.308
Buck! Mr. Manzell!

20:24.308 --> 20:26.351
You out there, ol' boy? Buck!

20:28.645 --> 20:31.899
- Christ. He could be anywhere.
- Yeah.

20:31.899 --> 20:34.943
Well, just pray his mug shot
isn't on the front page tomorrow.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.987
Maybe I can get the widow
back on the hook.

20:46.038 --> 20:48.832
Eyes to the skies.

20:49.333 --> 20:54.963
The Gargon mother ship. Right on schedule!

21:10.354 --> 21:13.190
They've been gone for five minutes
for about an hour now.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.317
You.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.195
Me. And a couple pals

21:18.195 --> 21:21.240
who like the truth better than
getting fucking ripped off.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.742
Don't be mad because Herbie chose me.

21:25.494 --> 21:28.747
Your Herbie's about to
get eaten alive. I hope he's ready.

21:29.665 --> 21:34.878
"Techincally," everyone here
is entitled to a prompt and full refund.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.508
Herbie's always ready. For anything.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.474
Hi, ma'am. Excuse me.

21:48.851 --> 21:52.855
I got together what
I hope can be a first payment,

21:52.855 --> 21:54.565
and maybe after that we can arrange a--

21:54.565 --> 21:57.234
Mr. Shorter, please.
Everything's settled now.

21:59.111 --> 22:00.112
How?

22:00.445 --> 22:03.866
Mr. Billings took care of it.
Must be nice to have a friend like that.

22:11.707 --> 22:13.292
<i>What happened with Joey?</i>

22:14.710 --> 22:16.545
I told him about Jenkins.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.883
- That's all you told him about?
- It's all I could get to.

22:24.636 --> 22:27.014
I'ma give him time
to come around on his own.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.686
I think he knows his life fits better
with me in it.

22:32.686 --> 22:33.979
Of course he does, Jack.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.904
Also said the same thing
about his mother 20 years ago.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.656
Well, that's the thing
about people, right?

22:45.490 --> 22:48.410
There's so many of them,
but they all let you down.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.584
W-- You mean her or him?

22:57.669 --> 22:58.670
Or me?

22:59.713 --> 23:00.714
Yep.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.675
Or Ed.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.886
Oh, Ed.

23:07.304 --> 23:08.680
You guys gonna be okay?

23:10.390 --> 23:11.433
I don't know.

23:13.268 --> 23:15.145
It's like we're in different worlds now.

23:19.149 --> 23:24.238
It's rough when caring about someone
means having to lie to 'em.

23:36.875 --> 23:41.922
Justice always finds a way.

23:47.719 --> 23:48.720
Yeah!

23:51.557 --> 23:55.018
Come on down, you ten-tackled heathen,

23:55.018 --> 23:57.688
and two-step with some horsepower!

24:00.399 --> 24:01.775
Apologies for the delay, everyone.

24:02.651 --> 24:03.819
How can I be of service today?

24:03.819 --> 24:06.405
You! You were in there the whole time?

24:06.405 --> 24:08.073
Conducting company business.

24:08.073 --> 24:11.326
They told us there's not even
going to be a launch!

24:11.326 --> 24:12.411
Oh, no, ma'am.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.246
Meaning yes.

24:14.246 --> 24:16.665
There will be a tremendous launch
two to three months from now.

24:16.665 --> 24:19.293
And who says you're not gonna be
saying the same exact thing

24:19.293 --> 24:20.878
two, three months from now?

24:20.878 --> 24:25.174
Me. You have my word,
and I'm very trustworthy.

24:25.174 --> 24:28.677
- Show us the rocket then.
- There's no rocket.

24:29.303 --> 24:31.680
- I think I want a refund.
- Me too.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.850
And you could all have one.
Brightside guarantees it.

24:38.979 --> 24:41.815
But there's no one
more important to me than our customers.

24:42.691 --> 24:45.068
So I just don't want you to regret

24:45.068 --> 24:47.279
regretting the best purchase
you've ever made.

24:48.655 --> 24:53.785
Now, what dreams worth soaring for
don't give you a fear of heights?

24:55.537 --> 24:58.081
Which may even be a rain cloud of doubt.

24:58.749 --> 24:59.750
Or worse.

25:00.334 --> 25:06.548
But that drizzle can't spoil the hard work
we've done to make the right plan happen.

25:07.132 --> 25:12.638
Which is exactly what The Brightside
is doing for you. Forever.

25:14.765 --> 25:16.308
Can I offer anyone a mint?

25:16.308 --> 25:20.938
Never mind the goddamn mints.
Where the fuck is Jack?

25:21.480 --> 25:25.025
Actually,
I'm the one who's been left in charge,

25:25.025 --> 25:28.862
so, anything you could say to him,
you could probably say to me.

25:29.738 --> 25:30.906
You're the one, huh?

25:31.490 --> 25:33.408
Okay, fucko.

25:38.705 --> 25:42.543
Ed? Wake up.
Herbie's about to be in a riot!

25:43.627 --> 25:47.673
Please, be anything
other than goddamn useless!

26:07.651 --> 26:09.027
It's actually 47 there.

26:11.029 --> 26:12.614
That's not even one payment.

26:12.614 --> 26:16.451
Well, sir, let me remind you.
These are actually my personal funds.

26:17.494 --> 26:20.622
So maybe you could do with
slightly less for right now?

26:21.623 --> 26:24.293
No more excuses! Shut up and pay up.

26:24.293 --> 26:26.503
It's contractually "oglibated."

26:29.673 --> 26:30.716
I've got money.

26:31.842 --> 26:34.344
Everyone calm down,
and we'll figure this out.

26:37.556 --> 26:39.391
Ma'am. Sir.

26:48.483 --> 26:49.610
You saved me, Bun Bun.

26:50.110 --> 26:52.112
- I always will.
- I believe it.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.455
Are you the type of person who regrets?

27:04.708 --> 27:06.960
I haven't found a good enough reason yet.

27:07.753 --> 27:08.754
You?

27:09.254 --> 27:11.340
Well, I try not to, but you know.

27:15.552 --> 27:20.140
When Joey comes back, Jack,
you gotta cut the shit. Be his dad.

27:20.140 --> 27:23.310
- That's good advice.
- Yeah, yeah. Don't just blow me off.

27:24.228 --> 27:25.312
Promise you'll do it.

27:29.858 --> 27:30.859
I promise.

27:39.034 --> 27:41.453
We can build it. We can make it real.

27:44.039 --> 27:46.500
The widow thinks she bought in
on a pump and dump,

27:46.500 --> 27:48.460
but she's gonna hand us a wad of cash--

27:48.460 --> 27:50.170
- No, Jack. It's--
- No, no.

27:51.046 --> 27:57.845
We could do it. You and me.
I mean, who else could pull it off?

27:57.845 --> 27:59.054
Don't do this.

27:59.054 --> 28:01.431
Don't start acting fucking crazy, okay?

28:01.431 --> 28:04.518
That's who I am. That's who you are too.
That's exactly what it takes.

28:04.518 --> 28:10.816
No, you're not that guy. You're the guy
Jenkins picked for his stooge.

28:13.527 --> 28:14.653
You'd be surprised.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.535
There he is! Start the car!

28:21.535 --> 28:23.161
Gargon scum!

28:23.161 --> 28:24.454
Start the car!

28:26.915 --> 28:28.542
How surprised would I be?
