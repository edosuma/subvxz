00:04.753 --> 00:08.454
Captain's log, stardate 5725.3.

00:08.632 --> 00:11.751
The Enterprise is
en route to Memory Alpha.

00:11.927 --> 00:13.919
It is a planetoid set up
by the Federation

00:14.095 --> 00:18.389
solely as a central library
containing the total cultural history

00:18.558 --> 00:22.555
and scientific knowledge
of all planetary Federation members.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.807
With us is specialist
Lieutenant Mira Romaine.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.310
She is onboard to supervise

00:27.483 --> 00:29.689
the transfer
of all newly-designed equipment

00:29.860 --> 00:33.110
directly from the Enterprise
to Memory Alpha.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.115
You're the sanest, the smartest,

00:36.283 --> 00:40.576
the nicest woman
that has ever come aboard this ship.

00:40.745 --> 00:42.074
Anything else?

00:43.665 --> 00:47.793
Anything else,
I'll keep to myself for the moment.

00:48.419 --> 00:51.622
When a man of Scotty's years
falls in love,

00:51.797 --> 00:55.047
the loneliness of his life
is suddenly revealed to him.

00:55.217 --> 00:58.800
His whole heart once throbbed
only to the ship's engines.

00:58.971 --> 01:01.640
He could talk only to the ship.

01:01.807 --> 01:04.179
Now he can see nothing
but the woman.

01:04.351 --> 01:08.135
I didn't think Mr. Scott
would go for the brainy type.

01:08.313 --> 01:11.314
I don't think he's even noticed
she has a brain.

01:13.985 --> 01:15.812
Mr. Scott.

01:16.946 --> 01:18.689
Mr. Scott?

01:20.908 --> 01:23.233
As soon as we're within viewing range
of Memory Alpha,

01:23.410 --> 01:25.035
you and Romaine
will go to your positions

01:25.204 --> 01:26.484
in the emergency manual monitor.

01:26.663 --> 01:30.163
You will prepare for direct transfer
of the equipment to Memory Alpha.

01:30.334 --> 01:32.125
- Aye, captain.
- We're ready, sir.

01:32.294 --> 01:35.081
Lieutenant,
may I offer my congratulations

01:35.255 --> 01:37.960
on what will be your first assignment
for the Federation.

01:38.133 --> 01:41.086
- Yes, good luck, lieutenant.
- Thank you.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.012
Captain, I'm picking
up a high-intensity reading.

01:49.185 --> 01:52.351
- Is that Memory Alpha?
- No, sir.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.520
Excuse me.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.481
Magnification 8.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.583
- What is that?
- Indications are a storm, captain.

02:13.749 --> 02:16.501
Although I have never seen one
of such great intensity

02:16.669 --> 02:18.875
or strange conformation.

02:19.046 --> 02:20.077
Readings?

02:20.255 --> 02:23.375
All sensor readings
are at maximum calibration.

02:23.550 --> 02:27.678
Captain, it is approaching at
warp factor 2.6 and accelerating.

02:27.846 --> 02:28.877
Check that.

02:29.055 --> 02:32.555
No natural phenomena can
move faster than the speed of light.

02:32.726 --> 02:34.683
It is definitely doing so, captain,

02:34.853 --> 02:37.557
therefore it cannot be
a phenomenon of nature.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.326 --> 02:55.193
- Deflectors on. Condition Yellow.
- Shields activated, captain.

03:33.241 --> 03:36.277
Space, the final frontier.

03:42.166 --> 03:46.459
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:46.628 --> 03:50.626
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:50.799 --> 03:54.499
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:54.677 --> 03:58.093
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.523
Mr. Sulu, get us
the devil out of here.

05:01.031 --> 05:03.238
Full scan on the disturbance
that penetrated the Bridge.

05:04.243 --> 05:07.243
Lieutenant. All decks,
stand at report.

05:08.288 --> 05:09.830
Mira.

05:11.500 --> 05:15.248
- Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. Emergency.
- Mira!

05:22.218 --> 05:24.460
What's that you're saying?

05:38.066 --> 05:41.233
Was she hurt by the fall
or the action of the disturbance?

05:41.903 --> 05:43.611
I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty?

05:43.780 --> 05:47.564
Well, after the disturbance was over,
she just collapsed.

05:55.249 --> 05:57.288
How's she doing, doctor?

05:57.459 --> 05:59.499
Well, I think she's
coming around now.

05:59.670 --> 06:04.462
Easy, now. Easy.
You had quite a fall.

06:05.258 --> 06:07.417
I'm... l'm fine.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.509
You let me be the judge of that.
Do you feel like walking to Sickbay?

06:12.682 --> 06:15.255
I'm fine, doctor. Really, I am.

06:15.601 --> 06:16.846
Is everybody else all right?

06:17.019 --> 06:20.269
Aye, they are. Now, you just do
what Dr. McCoy ordered.

06:20.439 --> 06:23.191
- Why? I feel...
- You go to Sickbay. That's an order.

06:23.359 --> 06:26.478
- Yes, sir.
- Would it be all right if I went along?

06:26.653 --> 06:28.112
No. Stay at your post
for the moment.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.608
- Captain...
- Lieutenant Uhura.

06:29.781 --> 06:30.813
- Yes, sir?
- Damage report?

06:30.991 --> 06:33.778
- All stations are operative, sir.
- Mr. Spock?

06:33.952 --> 06:35.944
Some equipment was temporarily
out of order.

06:36.121 --> 06:37.912
My sensors were inoperative.

06:38.081 --> 06:40.750
- Any damage to the warp engines?
- None, captain.

06:40.917 --> 06:46.207
Good. From the action of that storm,
we'll need all the speed we can get.

06:46.380 --> 06:49.298
Captain, it was not a storm.

06:49.925 --> 06:56.426
Captain, during the disturbance,
Memory Alpha was hailing.

06:56.598 --> 06:59.765
I wanted to respond,
but I couldn't make my hand move.

06:59.935 --> 07:01.512
Captain.

07:03.104 --> 07:05.642
It was not hands that were paralyzed.
It was eyes.

07:05.815 --> 07:08.436
I could not force my eyes to look down
and set a new course.

07:08.610 --> 07:12.654
No, no, it was speech that
was affected. I couldn't utter a sound.

07:17.159 --> 07:20.279
Mr. Spock. Explanation?

07:20.454 --> 07:22.660
Only of the result, not of the cause.

07:22.831 --> 07:25.915
In each case, a different area
of the brain was affected.

07:26.084 --> 07:30.295
Our voluntary nerve functions
were under some form of pressure.

07:31.464 --> 07:32.840
Or attack.

07:33.007 --> 07:36.376
Attack might be
a more precise formulation, captain.

07:41.140 --> 07:45.054
And Lieutenant Romaine
seems most susceptible.

08:00.366 --> 08:02.026
Are the readings corresponding,
nurse?

08:02.201 --> 08:04.028
Everything appears normal, doctor.

08:04.203 --> 08:05.781
Thank you.

08:15.130 --> 08:16.589
What's that you're doing, nurse?

08:16.757 --> 08:19.164
Recording your responses
in this computer.

08:19.343 --> 08:21.501
Why? I haven't had
a single response worth noting.

08:21.678 --> 08:24.679
- Lieutenant, please.
- Well, have I?

08:25.557 --> 08:28.511
Lieutenant, there are 430 people
aboard this ship.

08:29.143 --> 08:31.848
You're the only one that passed out
and I wanna know why.

08:32.020 --> 08:35.556
I want to know why too.
You're the doctor. You tell me.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.607
This whole thing is
a new experience for me.

08:37.777 --> 08:39.934
This whole thing is a new experience
for all of us.

08:40.111 --> 08:42.188
All of you are accustomed
to new experiences.

08:42.364 --> 08:44.238
It's part of your work.

08:45.450 --> 08:46.648
I'm not.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.866
She might have something there,
Dr. McCoy.

08:49.037 --> 08:52.406
This is her first deep space trip,
and you know how that affects people.

08:52.582 --> 08:54.242
Well, if we can get on with this,
Scotty,

08:54.417 --> 08:57.204
we might make that determination.

08:59.380 --> 09:02.464
Now, then, tell me. What did you feel
before you passed out?

09:03.467 --> 09:05.376
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

09:07.429 --> 09:09.422
Absolutely nothing.

09:09.598 --> 09:12.931
- Lieutenant...
- There is nothing more I can tell you.

09:13.101 --> 09:15.308
Lieutenant, you're being
completely uncooperative.

09:15.479 --> 09:17.767
Are you putting that into my record?
It's not true.

09:17.939 --> 09:20.311
I'll put the facts into your record
if I can get them.

09:22.944 --> 09:26.609
Come on, now, Mira.
We must help the doctor.

09:26.781 --> 09:28.240
Tell us what happened.

09:32.119 --> 09:33.827
Perhaps you can explain to her

09:33.996 --> 09:36.285
that any career she hopes for
in Starfleet

09:36.457 --> 09:40.122
requires discipline and cooperation.

09:40.294 --> 09:42.452
Well, I'm sure that's
what the lieutenant wants.

09:42.629 --> 09:45.167
She just didn't understand.

09:45.340 --> 09:47.546
Did you, now, lass?

09:50.512 --> 09:52.753
Well, with a bedside manner
like that, Scotty,

09:52.930 --> 09:55.468
you're in the wrong business.

10:00.104 --> 10:02.642
When the record of this is forwarded,
I'll be sent back, won't I?

10:02.815 --> 10:06.100
Well, you will not. That's ridiculous.

10:06.276 --> 10:09.230
This getting used to space travel,
that takes some doing.

10:09.404 --> 10:11.064
Not everybody takes to it.

10:11.239 --> 10:14.655
- Did you?
- Well, me, that's different.

10:14.826 --> 10:17.661
I was practically born to it.

10:18.288 --> 10:21.158
- I want to continue.
- You will.

10:21.332 --> 10:25.709
You passed your Starfleet
preliminary examinations.

10:26.837 --> 10:32.792
And this is just getting used to what
you might call your space legs.

10:36.888 --> 10:38.964
I hope that's all it is.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.678
Captain, I've plotted the storm's path.

10:42.268 --> 10:43.846
Mr. Lemli.

10:46.314 --> 10:48.520
Main screen projection.

10:50.026 --> 10:51.224
On its present course,

10:51.402 --> 10:54.071
it will hit the Memory Alpha planetoid
as it did us.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.731
Lieutenant, try
and warn Memory Alpha

10:56.907 --> 10:58.485
of the proximity of that phenomenon.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.363
- Give me an ETA for its impact.
- I cannot, sir.

11:01.537 --> 11:03.079
It has the ability to change speed.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.207
Sir, I'm unable to establish contact
with the planetoid.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.162
I'm hailing on all frequencies.
No response.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.795
It is of little consequence, captain.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.002
Memory Alpha has
no protective shields.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.875
- No shields?
- None, captain.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.842
When the library complex
was assembled,

11:19.011 --> 11:22.629
shielding was considered inappropriate
to its totally academic purpose.

11:22.806 --> 11:24.514
Since the information on
the memory planet

11:24.683 --> 11:26.308
is freely available to everyone,

11:26.477 --> 11:29.098
special protection
was deemed unnecessary.

11:29.271 --> 11:33.565
Wonderful. I hope the storm
is aware of that rationale.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.477
Completing approach to planetoid.

11:35.652 --> 11:37.609
It is already over Memory Alpha,
captain.

11:37.779 --> 11:41.230
Its speed is incredible.
It's hitting the planetoid.

11:44.243 --> 11:45.903
Are we within orbit range,
Mr. Chekov?

11:46.078 --> 11:47.241
Making final approach.

11:47.413 --> 11:48.990
Lieutenant, try and warn...

11:49.165 --> 11:52.201
I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through
this interference.

11:58.632 --> 12:03.590
Mr. Spock, how many people
are on Memory Alpha?

12:03.762 --> 12:06.431
It varies with the number
of scholars, researchers and scientists

12:06.598 --> 12:09.966
from various Federation planets
who are using the computer complex.

12:10.143 --> 12:14.010
Captain, we are within orbit range.

12:18.275 --> 12:20.232
- Lock into orbit.
- Aye, sir.

12:20.402 --> 12:22.110
It is leaving Memory Alpha, captain.

12:22.279 --> 12:23.477
Sensors give no readings

12:23.655 --> 12:26.111
of generated energy
from Memory Alpha, captain.

12:26.283 --> 12:28.952
- Any life readings?
- None.

12:34.791 --> 12:37.495
Let's find out
what's going on down there.

12:40.630 --> 12:43.630
Kirk to Engineering.
Mr. Scott, report.

12:43.799 --> 12:46.966
Kirk to Engineering. Mr. Scott?
Where the devil is he?

12:47.136 --> 12:50.469
Scotty, report to the Bridge.
Report to the Bridge.

12:51.473 --> 12:54.011
Transporter Room, stand by.
I'm taking a landing party down there.

12:54.184 --> 12:56.591
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Scott here.

12:57.062 --> 12:59.184
Scotty, where've you been?
Where are you?

12:59.355 --> 13:01.348
- In the Sickbay.
- Are you sick?

13:02.442 --> 13:05.810
No. I was just checking on the lass.

13:05.987 --> 13:08.478
She's going to be fine, though.
There's nothing wrong with her.

13:08.656 --> 13:11.147
Well, I'm relieved
to hear your prognosis, Mr. Scott.

13:11.325 --> 13:14.860
Is the doctor there with you
or will I find him in Engineering?

13:17.164 --> 13:19.868
- McCoy here, Jim.
- Doctor, how's the girl?

13:20.042 --> 13:24.668
- Well, I think she's in good shape.
- Mr. Scott seems to agree with you.

13:25.046 --> 13:27.798
The two of you, meet me in
the Transporter Room on the double.

13:47.401 --> 13:53.273
Captain's log, supplemental,
stardate 5725.6.

13:53.698 --> 13:58.360
The storm has cleared Memory Alpha.
It is heading away at incredible speed.

13:58.536 --> 14:01.869
We have been unable
to make contact with the planetoid.

14:02.039 --> 14:04.957
Its silence is ominous.

14:05.126 --> 14:07.877
We are beaming down
to investigate.

14:09.546 --> 14:12.666
Somehow I find transporting
into the darkness unnerving.

14:12.841 --> 14:15.166
Scotty, can you get us
some more light?

14:23.309 --> 14:25.598
I'm afraid this light
will have to do, captain.

14:25.770 --> 14:27.679
The generator is inoperative.

14:27.855 --> 14:31.105
- Damage report, Spock.
- Disaster for the galaxy, captain.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.683
The central brain is damaged.
Memory core is burned out.

14:33.861 --> 14:36.530
The loss to the galaxy
may be irretrievable.

14:38.157 --> 14:39.734
Captain!

15:05.099 --> 15:07.933
A very faint life reading
in the immediate vicinity, captain.

15:08.101 --> 15:09.382
Locate him. Keep him alive.

15:09.561 --> 15:11.969
We need more information
about this enemy.

15:14.816 --> 15:15.895
Over here, captain!

15:27.453 --> 15:30.952
- Bones, can you do something?
- Not a thing, Jim.

15:37.629 --> 15:39.954
The same garbled sounds
Lieutenant Romaine made

15:40.131 --> 15:41.958
when she fainted after the storm.

15:42.133 --> 15:45.253
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely sure.

15:46.596 --> 15:48.304
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Sulu here.

15:48.473 --> 15:51.177
Beam down
Lieutenant Romaine immediately.

16:01.109 --> 16:03.102
Spock.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.736
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

16:05.906 --> 16:06.985
Negative.

16:14.664 --> 16:17.867
- Bones?
- She's dead.

16:18.042 --> 16:21.493
- What did she die of?
- Severe brain haemorrhaging.

16:21.670 --> 16:23.996
Due to distortion
of all neural systems.

16:24.173 --> 16:26.842
Dissolution of
autonomic nervous system.

16:27.009 --> 16:29.334
All basic personality factors, captain.

16:29.845 --> 16:34.423
- The attack was thorough.
- What did the others die of?

16:34.599 --> 16:38.015
Each had a different centre
of brain destroyed, cause unknown.

16:38.186 --> 16:41.306
A different centre of the brain,
you say?

16:41.481 --> 16:44.896
Yes, captain. I can be more detailed
when we return to the ship.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.396
Use the ship's computers.

16:52.241 --> 16:53.783
Mira.

16:54.910 --> 16:57.531
The captain has some questions.

16:58.997 --> 17:00.277
- Yes, captain?
- Lieutenant.

17:00.457 --> 17:03.576
When you were unconscious,
you were speaking.

17:04.210 --> 17:05.325
What did I say?

17:05.502 --> 17:07.875
I don't know. The words
were unfamiliar to me.

17:08.047 --> 17:09.078
What did it sound like?

17:09.257 --> 17:12.541
They sounded exactly like the last
words spoken by the technician.

17:12.718 --> 17:13.915
What technician?

17:14.095 --> 17:16.585
We found one person in there,
just barely alive.

17:16.763 --> 17:20.049
- The rest were dead and we...
- Lieutenant.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.234
- Lieutenant?
- We must get back to the ship.

17:32.403 --> 17:37.030
- Why? Tell me, why?
- That storm, it's returning.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.577
- How do you know?
- I know. You'll be killed if we stay.

17:41.746 --> 17:44.865
Lieutenant, I assure you,
that unexplained phenomenon

17:45.040 --> 17:46.582
was headed away from the planet.

17:46.750 --> 17:50.415
- It is probably seeking other victims.
- I tell you, it will kill us.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.548
- Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
- Kirk here.

17:59.721 --> 18:02.722
Bridge, sir. The storm has reappeared
on the long-range scanner

18:02.890 --> 18:04.433
and is closing fast.

18:07.770 --> 18:11.684
- What's its course?
- Coming back in this direction.

18:13.609 --> 18:15.648
Beam us up.

18:26.287 --> 18:28.743
Mr. Sulu, this is the captain.
Get the Enterprise out of here.

18:28.915 --> 18:31.322
Wait, captain, we've lost Mira.

18:33.252 --> 18:35.079
- Delay that order, Mr. Sulu.
- Stabilise her.

18:35.254 --> 18:37.543
Something's interfering.
I have her coordinates,

18:37.715 --> 18:39.292
but she is suspended in transit.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.009
Let me.

19:04.990 --> 19:07.777
All right, Mr. Sulu,
get us out of here.

19:07.952 --> 19:11.819
Mr. Scott, check emergency manual
monitor for transporter control.

19:26.552 --> 19:29.174
Captain, it's changing course.

19:29.639 --> 19:31.097
Plot the new course, Mr. Chekov.

19:31.265 --> 19:34.349
- Present course is 126, mark 20.
- Plot it.

19:34.893 --> 19:38.179
Present course will bring it across
our starboard side, sir.

19:38.355 --> 19:43.017
Mr. Spock, you made a statement
that phenomenon is not a storm.

19:43.193 --> 19:44.308
Explain.

19:44.486 --> 19:46.063
No known conditions in space

19:46.237 --> 19:48.313
would support that type
of natural phenomenon.

19:48.490 --> 19:51.526
- What is it?
- I'm having difficulty with the sensors.

19:51.701 --> 19:54.192
They seem to be under selective attack
by the phenomenon

19:54.370 --> 19:57.157
as the unfortunate occupants
of Memory Alpha were.

19:57.331 --> 20:00.202
Then deductive reasoning
has to be substituted.

20:00.376 --> 20:03.045
Ship's sensors are operating
at the moment.

20:03.212 --> 20:07.209
Perhaps the elusive creature will
now reveal something about itself.

20:07.382 --> 20:11.214
But I saw those men dead,
in their exact positions.

20:11.386 --> 20:13.213
Listen to me.

20:13.388 --> 20:17.848
I've told you what strange tricks
a space trip can play on your mind.

20:18.017 --> 20:21.386
- Now, that's all it is.
- No, Scotty.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.688
Have you ever had visions
of the future events before this?

20:26.567 --> 20:29.817
- Never.
- And if you ask me, nobody ever has.

20:29.987 --> 20:32.904
That seeing of the future,
it's pure bunk.

20:33.073 --> 20:34.982
You know that, don't you?

20:35.158 --> 20:38.741
- I've always believed it.
- And you were perfectly right.

20:40.455 --> 20:43.409
Then what is it, Scotty?
What's frightening me?

20:43.583 --> 20:48.079
Ever since that storm hit,
I've had such strange thoughts,

20:48.254 --> 20:50.959
such feelings of terror.

20:51.132 --> 20:57.217
It's space. Space. That's all it is.

21:00.182 --> 21:01.925
Then I don't have to report it?

21:02.100 --> 21:05.434
Well, if you want to spend
the rest of the trip in Sickbay.

21:05.604 --> 21:06.932
But what good would that do?

21:07.105 --> 21:10.770
Dr. McCoy can no more cure it
than he can a cold.

21:18.324 --> 21:20.482
Captain, it's heading straight for us.

21:20.659 --> 21:23.613
- Activate shields.
- Shields activated.

21:23.787 --> 21:26.954
Mr. Chekov,
change course to 143, mark 3.

21:27.124 --> 21:30.956
- One-four-three, mark 3.
- Storm's course, Mr. Sulu?

21:31.128 --> 21:33.500
One-four-three, mark 3.

21:34.339 --> 21:36.628
- Take evasive action.
- Evasive action.

21:37.717 --> 21:41.964
Hard starboard, 217, mark 5.

21:42.138 --> 21:44.629
Two-one-seven, mark 5.

21:59.696 --> 22:01.155
Still with us, sir.

22:01.323 --> 22:06.661
Hard port, 117, mark 2.

22:06.828 --> 22:08.867
One-one-seven, mark 2.

22:12.458 --> 22:13.489
Still with us, sir.

22:16.754 --> 22:17.785
Is it closing?

22:17.963 --> 22:20.501
Negative, captain.
Maintaining its distance.

22:20.674 --> 22:24.292
However, it is matching
each manoeuvre we execute

22:24.469 --> 22:28.004
and I am receiving
increasing magnitude of energy.

22:52.579 --> 22:55.070
Your analysis, Spock? What is it?

22:55.248 --> 22:58.368
Not what is it, captain.
What are they?

23:01.379 --> 23:03.455
There are ten distinct life units
within it,

23:03.631 --> 23:05.707
all powerfully alive and vital.

23:08.552 --> 23:09.833
Who are they?
Where are they from?

23:10.471 --> 23:13.721
Lmpossible to determine without
programming for computer analysis.

23:13.891 --> 23:16.382
It's clear we can't outrun them.
Can we shield against them?

23:16.560 --> 23:19.893
I do not believe the Enterprise shields
would prove an effective defence.

23:20.063 --> 23:22.103
There must be some defence
we can use.

23:22.274 --> 23:25.524
Captain, we are dealing
with a community of life units.

23:25.693 --> 23:28.445
Their attack is in
the form of brainwaves

23:28.613 --> 23:31.020
directed against the brain
which is most compatible.

23:31.491 --> 23:33.198
Maybe we can avoid another attack.

23:33.367 --> 23:37.828
Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels.
Tie in the universal translator.

23:37.997 --> 23:41.081
Mr. Spock says it's alive.

23:41.917 --> 23:43.744
Maybe I can talk to it.

23:43.919 --> 23:47.537
All channels open. Translator tied in.

23:51.926 --> 23:54.761
This is Captain James Kirk
of the USS Enterprise.

23:55.471 --> 23:57.594
We wish you no harm.

24:10.861 --> 24:13.648
Physical contact between us
is fatal to our life forms.

24:13.822 --> 24:18.282
Please, do not come
any closer to our ship.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.204
Perhaps it did not understand.

24:24.374 --> 24:26.781
Captain, change in velocity recorded.

24:29.795 --> 24:32.582
They're passing our starboard side
and moving in front of us.

24:33.174 --> 24:34.751
Switching to forward scanner.

24:46.478 --> 24:51.472
Captain, change in velocity recorded.
It has accelerated its approach.

24:56.988 --> 24:58.980
Help, Scotty.

25:00.366 --> 25:03.035
Hold me. It's happening again.

25:10.125 --> 25:11.702
No!

25:12.294 --> 25:13.871
Mira...

25:16.673 --> 25:19.923
Perhaps it understands
another kind of language.

25:20.384 --> 25:25.011
Condition Red Alert.
Prepare for phaser firing.

25:26.182 --> 25:29.846
- Mira.
- No, Scotty! No!

25:32.271 --> 25:36.897
- Lock in phaser tracking controls.
- Locked in, sir.

25:37.067 --> 25:40.068
Adjust phasers,
we'll fire across its course.

25:40.236 --> 25:41.731
Do not hit it.

25:43.198 --> 25:45.190
- Locked in, sir.
- Fire.

25:53.874 --> 25:55.867
Reaction, Mr. Sulu?

25:56.043 --> 25:58.913
None, sir.
They're still approaching us.

26:07.637 --> 26:11.220
Apparently a shot across the bow
is insufficiently convincing.

26:13.935 --> 26:17.185
Prepare to lock phasers
into the heart of the community.

26:21.901 --> 26:23.443
- Locked in, sir.
- Fire.

26:25.529 --> 26:27.189
Scotty!

26:28.198 --> 26:29.858
Mira!

26:30.867 --> 26:31.899
Mira.

26:32.077 --> 26:34.034
The phasers seem
to have stopped their approach.

26:34.204 --> 26:35.746
They're holding position.

26:35.914 --> 26:38.037
Lock in for another blast.

26:38.208 --> 26:41.576
- Locked in, sir.
- Captain!

26:44.380 --> 26:46.622
Captain, the phaser shots
are killing Mira!

26:47.716 --> 26:48.748
Killing Lieutenant Romaine?

26:48.926 --> 26:51.761
When you fired the phasers,
they stunned her and she crumpled.

26:51.929 --> 26:53.589
Another shot and you'll kill her.

26:55.807 --> 26:57.088
Get her to Sickbay at once.

26:59.769 --> 27:01.762
Ready for firing, captain.

27:05.108 --> 27:06.935
Cancel that order.

27:15.284 --> 27:18.451
Another attack on that alien life form
will kill Lieutenant Romaine.

27:18.620 --> 27:22.072
- It appears so.
- If she is to survive, we can't attack.

27:22.249 --> 27:23.494
Not directly.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.126
Can the computer supply a defence

27:25.293 --> 27:27.120
based on the data
you've been accumulating?

27:27.295 --> 27:28.326
Negative, captain.

27:28.505 --> 27:31.541
I have not been able
to gather sufficient data for that.

27:31.966 --> 27:34.801
Captain, there is only
one possible defence.

27:34.969 --> 27:39.132
If we can find an environment
which is deadly to the alien form.

27:39.307 --> 27:42.142
And yet isolate the girl
from its deadly effects.

27:48.816 --> 27:51.306
- Captain Kirk to Dr. McCoy.
- Yes, captain.

27:51.485 --> 27:53.561
Is the girl well enough
to be questioned?

27:53.737 --> 27:55.943
I can have her ready
in a few minutes.

27:56.114 --> 27:58.272
Have the lieutenant and Mr. Scott

27:58.450 --> 28:00.323
in the briefing room
as quickly as possible.

28:00.493 --> 28:04.656
Bring all available biographical material
with you. Kirk out.

28:04.831 --> 28:06.870
Mr. Spock, come with me.

28:17.801 --> 28:19.924
Go easy on her, Jim.
She's in a pretty bad state.

28:20.095 --> 28:21.554
I'll try.

28:24.391 --> 28:26.264
Lieutenant Romaine.

28:35.651 --> 28:37.727
I didn't mean to be uncooperative,
doctor.

28:37.903 --> 28:39.695
Of course you didn't.
I told the captain.

28:39.863 --> 28:42.022
We must get to understand
what is happening.

28:42.199 --> 28:44.690
I'll tell you everything I know.

28:45.243 --> 28:46.702
The ship's investigative procedures

28:46.870 --> 28:49.325
are sometimes confusing
to a new crewman.

28:49.497 --> 28:53.744
- Don't let us upset you.
- I trust all of you implicitly.

28:56.546 --> 28:57.577
I want to help.

28:57.755 --> 29:01.041
This investigation has been
prompted by two events.

29:01.217 --> 29:04.004
First is the time
you passed out on the Bridge

29:04.178 --> 29:06.467
and the second is when we fired
our main phasers

29:06.639 --> 29:10.221
into that force that is attacking us
and seriously injured you.

29:10.392 --> 29:15.054
- You mustn't worry about hurting me.
- Now, this is how we'll proceed.

29:15.230 --> 29:21.599
Mr. Spock has all the information
available to us about our attackers.

29:21.778 --> 29:25.906
Dr. McCoy has access to
Starfleet's exhaustive files on you.

29:26.073 --> 29:28.944
A comparison of the two may turn up
some improbable connection,

29:29.118 --> 29:32.701
which may protect you
and ourselves.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.078
All right, gentlemen?

29:35.416 --> 29:36.910
Dr. McCoy, will you proceed?

29:43.089 --> 29:44.418
Romaine, Mira, lieutenant.

29:44.591 --> 29:46.963
Place of birth,
Martian Colony Number 3.

29:47.135 --> 29:49.756
Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased.

29:49.929 --> 29:53.630
Jacques Romaine,
chief engineer of Starfleet, retired.

29:54.267 --> 29:57.267
Mr. Spock, are you prepared with the
background history of the attackers?

29:57.436 --> 30:01.054
I am, captain. I have fed all obtainable
data to the main computer.

30:01.231 --> 30:03.901
It should be ready to supply
whatever conclusions are possible.

30:04.067 --> 30:05.894
Thank you.

30:06.069 --> 30:08.607
Mr. Sulu, what is the status
of our friends up there?

30:08.780 --> 30:11.781
Status unchanged. They're still with
us and keeping the same distance.

30:11.950 --> 30:16.612
Continue evasive manoeuvres.
Keep me informed. Kirk out.

30:16.788 --> 30:20.785
Doctor, do you have a medical record
of Lieutenant Romaine available?

30:20.958 --> 30:21.990
Yes, captain.

30:22.168 --> 30:25.619
I'd like a few items from
her psychological profile checked.

30:30.134 --> 30:32.921
Any history of psychosomatic
illness?

30:35.180 --> 30:37.932
Occasional, in teenage routine
incidents.

30:38.099 --> 30:41.515
Any evidence of involuntary
or unconscious telepathic abilities?

30:45.565 --> 30:46.596
None.

30:46.774 --> 30:51.815
Any pathological or unusual
empathic responses?

30:54.532 --> 30:56.820
No, captain, not empathic.

30:56.992 --> 31:00.491
However, an extremely flexible
and pliant response

31:00.662 --> 31:02.785
to new learning situations
is highly marked.

31:04.416 --> 31:06.954
- Go ahead, doctor.
- Right after our phasers hit that thing,

31:07.127 --> 31:10.163
I gave Lieutenant Romaine
a standard Steinman analysis.

31:10.338 --> 31:12.663
- The results might be interesting.
- Go ahead.

31:16.260 --> 31:19.178
A comparison of our Steinman
with Starfleet records

31:19.346 --> 31:23.426
shows that Lieutenant Romaine's
fingerprints, voice analysis,

31:23.600 --> 31:27.680
all external factors
remain exactly the same as before.

31:27.854 --> 31:31.021
However, according to
two hyperencephalograms,

31:31.191 --> 31:33.397
her brainwave pattern
has been altered.

31:37.197 --> 31:40.114
- But that's impossible.
- That's what I was taught.

31:40.283 --> 31:43.200
But the BCP is just
as consistent as fingerprints.

31:43.369 --> 31:44.400
Let's see it.

31:52.252 --> 31:54.708
Dr. McCoy,
according to your records,

31:54.880 --> 31:58.213
Lieutenant Romaine showed
no abnormal telepathic powers.

31:58.633 --> 32:03.591
That's right, Spock,
but exceptional pliancy was indicated.

32:03.763 --> 32:05.092
That might be a factor.

32:05.557 --> 32:09.056
And you are sure that
this is the correct slide?

32:09.560 --> 32:12.561
Yes, Mr. Spock.
That is Tape Deck D,

32:12.730 --> 32:15.766
brain circuitry pattern
of Lieutenant Mira Romaine.

32:15.941 --> 32:20.318
Gentlemen, it also happens
to be Tape H,

32:20.487 --> 32:23.607
the impulse tracking
obtained from the alien life units.

32:24.950 --> 32:28.034
Nurse Chapel followed this every step
of the way. There can be no error.

32:28.203 --> 32:29.401
Check it, Spock.

32:37.962 --> 32:42.125
As I said, captain, this is the tracking
obtained during the last shielded run.

32:46.929 --> 32:49.217
Computer,
run a detailed comparison,

32:49.389 --> 32:53.766
brain circuitry patterns,
Tape D and Tape H.

32:53.935 --> 32:58.846
Comparison Tape D, brain circuitry
patterns of Lieutenant Mira Romaine

32:59.023 --> 33:02.273
and Tape H, brain circuitry patterns
of alien life unit.

33:02.443 --> 33:05.230
Identical. Identical.

33:08.115 --> 33:09.609
Fascinating.

33:12.786 --> 33:16.535
- There has been no error.
- Dr. McCoy is correct, captain.

33:16.707 --> 33:18.995
There is an identity of minds
taking place

33:19.167 --> 33:22.334
between the alien beings
and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine.

33:23.463 --> 33:27.461
Their thoughts are becoming hers.

33:34.807 --> 33:35.970
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

33:36.142 --> 33:38.300
The alien is no longer
maintaining its distance.

33:38.477 --> 33:40.968
Continue evasive action.
Keep me informed. Kirk out.

33:50.030 --> 33:54.822
Mira has tried to tell me all along that
she was seeing things in advance.

33:55.368 --> 33:57.111
Why didn't you report it?

33:57.286 --> 34:00.821
You don't report space sickness.
That's all I thought it was.

34:01.374 --> 34:04.992
- What did she see?
- The first attack on the ship.

34:05.753 --> 34:12.170
The attack on Memory Alpha,
and the time we nearly lost her.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.882
Those were all acts
carried out by our attacker.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.549
And...

34:24.437 --> 34:26.228
And...

34:27.523 --> 34:29.599
Yes, Scotty.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.648
What else?

34:34.780 --> 34:37.532
I thought for a moment
there was something else,

34:37.699 --> 34:40.369
but I guess I was wrong.

34:40.534 --> 34:44.699
- Was he wrong, Lieutenant?
- Yes, there was one other time.

34:44.873 --> 34:47.909
- What did you see?
- I saw Scotty.

34:48.083 --> 34:49.958
Where?

34:51.295 --> 34:53.205
- I don't know.
- What was he doing?

35:01.847 --> 35:04.089
He was dying.

35:08.186 --> 35:11.104
Now I understand
what's been happening.

35:12.607 --> 35:17.732
I've been seeing
through... another mind.

35:18.321 --> 35:20.029
I've been flooded with thoughts,

35:21.407 --> 35:23.863
not my own, that control me.

35:24.035 --> 35:26.704
Oh, Scotty, Scotty,
I'd rather die than hurt you.

35:26.871 --> 35:28.495
I'd rather die.

35:28.664 --> 35:31.369
All right, now.

35:31.542 --> 35:35.621
What's all this talk of dying?

35:36.254 --> 35:40.086
They've called the turn on us
three out of four times.

35:40.258 --> 35:44.469
Now, that's a better average
than anybody deserves.

35:44.637 --> 35:48.172
It's our turn now. We'll fight them.

35:48.349 --> 35:53.094
So let's not hear
anything more about dying.

35:54.730 --> 35:56.604
- Kirk here.
- Sulu, captain.

35:56.774 --> 35:58.813
All evasion tactics
carried out as ordered.

35:59.318 --> 36:02.651
- What success did you have?
- It's been useless, captain.

36:03.321 --> 36:06.655
At their present force, they will get
through the shields this time, captain.

36:09.035 --> 36:11.740
- Warp 8, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

36:12.622 --> 36:14.614
They'll be here very soon.

36:15.374 --> 36:18.743
They may destroy you and us
as they did Memory Alpha.

36:19.211 --> 36:22.331
You are especially
susceptible to their will.

36:22.506 --> 36:26.290
But we have one chance to survive.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.420
Don't resist.

36:28.595 --> 36:31.798
Let them begin
to function through you.

36:33.642 --> 36:38.802
If we can control that moment,
we have a chance. Will you try?

36:44.235 --> 36:46.642
Tell me what to do.

36:47.738 --> 36:51.154
- Captain Kirk to Medical Lab.
- Medical Lab here, sir.

36:51.325 --> 36:54.658
Prepare the antigrav test units.
Let's go.

37:06.714 --> 37:10.664
Attention, all personnel, attention.
Alien force has penetrated the ship.

37:10.843 --> 37:12.883
Take defensive action.

37:14.680 --> 37:18.096
Attention, all personnel. The alien
being has penetrated the ship.

37:18.267 --> 37:20.010
Take defensive action.

37:22.020 --> 37:25.638
General quarters,
Security Condition 3, intruder alert.

37:25.816 --> 37:32.434
Repeat, general quarters,
Security Condition 3, intruder alert.

37:44.250 --> 37:48.543
As soon as she has entered
the gravity chamber, secure all ports.

37:56.177 --> 37:59.629
Don't touch me, Scotty. Stay away.

38:18.782 --> 38:21.189
We've lost her to them.

38:24.371 --> 38:26.696
- Stay where you are.
- She could kill us all in this state.

38:26.873 --> 38:27.904
She will,

38:28.082 --> 38:31.083
unless we are able to complete
what the captain has planned.

38:31.252 --> 38:34.372
Stay with us, Mira. Please stay.

38:35.673 --> 38:37.630
I'm trying.

38:40.094 --> 38:42.667
I want to be with you.

38:43.222 --> 38:45.380
They are too strong.

38:45.557 --> 38:48.641
Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on.

39:00.196 --> 39:03.730
I am Mira Romaine.

39:04.450 --> 39:09.325
I will be who I choose to be.

39:11.290 --> 39:13.329
I will...

39:13.500 --> 39:15.077
Stay away, Scotty!

39:16.670 --> 39:18.958
They're with me.

39:20.340 --> 39:22.131
They will kill you.

39:23.468 --> 39:25.128
You won't let them.

39:36.814 --> 39:39.304
She cannot stop us.

39:39.483 --> 39:41.309
You cannot prevent it.

39:43.987 --> 39:46.857
Mira. Mira!

39:47.657 --> 39:49.448
Captain.

39:49.784 --> 39:50.863
That's not Mira talking.

39:51.035 --> 39:52.695
Captain, we must deal
with them directly.

39:52.870 --> 39:57.117
Now, while she still retains partial
identity, we can speak to them.

39:57.291 --> 39:59.699
They will answer using her voice.

40:09.219 --> 40:14.011
I'm Captain James Kirk
of the spaceship Enterprise.

40:16.017 --> 40:17.926
Do you understand?

40:18.519 --> 40:21.306
Yes, we understand you.

40:21.480 --> 40:26.901
We have searched for a millennium
for one through whom we can see

40:27.069 --> 40:31.565
and speak and hear
and live out our lives.

40:31.740 --> 40:35.868
- Who are you?
- We are from Zetar.

40:36.036 --> 40:39.037
That is one of the planets where
all humanoid life was destroyed.

40:40.749 --> 40:46.039
You can't be from Zetar.
All life was destroyed there long ago.

40:46.212 --> 40:51.253
- Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed.
- Then what are you?

40:51.425 --> 40:58.222
The desires, the hopes, the mind and
the will of the last hundred of Zetar.

40:58.390 --> 41:01.723
The force of our life
could not be wiped out.

41:01.893 --> 41:06.270
- All things die.
- At the proper time.

41:06.439 --> 41:11.018
Our planet was dying.
We were determined to live on.

41:11.444 --> 41:17.233
At the peak of our plans to go,
a sudden final disaster struck us down.

41:18.034 --> 41:21.449
But the force of our lives survived.

41:21.954 --> 41:26.248
At last we have found someone
through whom we can live it out.

41:27.292 --> 41:31.753
The body of the one you inhabit
has its own life to lead.

41:31.922 --> 41:34.757
She will accept ours.

41:34.924 --> 41:38.922
She will not.
She is fighting for her own identity.

41:39.095 --> 41:46.058
Her mind will accept our thoughts.
Our lives will be fulfilled.

41:46.477 --> 41:49.478
Will she learn the way the people
on Memory Alpha learned?

41:49.647 --> 41:52.932
- We did not wish to kill.
- But you did kill.

41:53.108 --> 41:57.271
No. Resisting us killed those people.

41:58.113 --> 41:59.904
We did not kill them.

42:00.073 --> 42:03.109
The price of your survival is too high.

42:03.701 --> 42:05.658
We only want the girl.

42:05.828 --> 42:07.287
You can't have her.

42:07.455 --> 42:10.658
You're entitled to your own life,
but not another's.

42:17.131 --> 42:21.128
Life was given to me.

42:22.970 --> 42:28.094
It is mine. I want to live it out.

42:28.767 --> 42:31.388
I... will...

42:32.812 --> 42:36.679
The girl's life reading
is becoming a match to the Zetarians'.

42:36.858 --> 42:38.565
She's losing.

42:39.485 --> 42:41.976
Do not fight us.

42:42.154 --> 42:44.028
They will not accept
their own deaths.

42:48.410 --> 42:49.988
They'll be forced to accept it.

42:50.495 --> 42:53.366
You will all die.

42:53.540 --> 42:57.833
Captain, if we cannot complete
the plan, they will carry out their threat.

42:58.002 --> 42:59.995
We must get her
into the pressure chamber.

43:00.171 --> 43:05.876
Jim, you realise the pressure needed
to kill the Zetars might kill the girl, too.

43:09.972 --> 43:12.593
Mira will not kill me.

43:48.425 --> 43:50.382
Told you she wouldn't kill me.

43:50.552 --> 43:51.583
Secure the chamber.

43:58.017 --> 43:59.808
Neutralise the gravity.

44:09.111 --> 44:10.771
The Zetars are growing stronger.

44:10.946 --> 44:14.065
A weightless state has become
their natural condition.

44:15.158 --> 44:17.234
Pressurise the unit.

44:22.123 --> 44:23.582
Bring pressure up to two atmospheres

44:23.750 --> 44:26.240
and then increase
one atmosphere per second.

44:45.645 --> 44:47.851
Continue increasing pressure.

45:06.081 --> 45:08.120
Pressure, Spock. Pressure.

45:13.421 --> 45:15.295
The pressure is dangerously high,
captain.

45:17.091 --> 45:18.467
It may damage her.

45:21.012 --> 45:22.292
Continue, Spock.

46:08.181 --> 46:09.841
Pressure.

46:20.901 --> 46:23.937
We've done it, Jim. They're gone.

46:29.659 --> 46:32.446
It's all right, Mira. They're gone.

46:34.205 --> 46:36.198
They're gone.

46:44.715 --> 46:47.716
Reduce the pressure
very, very gradually, Spock.

46:48.510 --> 46:51.547
We may tax Mr. Scott's patience,
doctor.

47:05.860 --> 47:08.777
Now, lie perfectly still, lieutenant.
Try not to move at all.

47:08.946 --> 47:11.781
Take deep, regular breaths.

47:12.491 --> 47:15.942
But don't hold it.
Continue to breathe deeply.

47:16.870 --> 47:22.410
In... out... in... out.

47:22.584 --> 47:25.538
That's it. Now, you'll be in there
another 20 minutes,

47:25.712 --> 47:27.621
so why don't you just try to relax.

47:32.594 --> 47:34.966
Now we have all the time
in the world.

47:58.409 --> 47:59.489
Bones, are you able to judge

47:59.661 --> 48:01.783
the long-range effects
on Lieutenant Romaine?

48:01.954 --> 48:04.030
When the personality of a human
is involved,

48:04.207 --> 48:06.413
exact predictions are hazardous.

48:06.584 --> 48:08.576
Particularly where humans
are involved, doctor.

48:08.752 --> 48:12.797
However, despite Starfleet judgement
of the pliancy of the lieutenant,

48:12.965 --> 48:15.669
she put up a valiant struggle
to retain her identity

48:15.842 --> 48:17.123
and I find that encouraging.

48:17.302 --> 48:18.796
Dr. McCoy is correct, captain.

48:19.846 --> 48:21.506
While the truth
was difficult to accept,

48:21.681 --> 48:24.302
when it was revealed,
the girl reacted well.

48:24.476 --> 48:26.433
I would say her struggle
in this experience

48:26.603 --> 48:29.140
would strengthen
her entire ego structure.

48:29.313 --> 48:33.607
Would either of you credit Scotty's
steadfast belief in her as a factor?

48:33.776 --> 48:36.942
You mean love as motivation?

48:40.240 --> 48:44.819
Humans do claim a great deal
for that particular emotion.

48:44.995 --> 48:47.699
I suppose it is possible.
However...

48:47.873 --> 48:49.664
There are no howevers about it,
Mr. Spock.

48:49.833 --> 48:53.332
It was a factor and it will be
a factor in her recovery.

48:54.212 --> 48:57.545
Do I take it both of you agree
that Lieutenant Romaine

48:57.715 --> 49:00.004
need not return to starbase
for further treatment?

49:00.176 --> 49:02.382
Well, I should think
work would be a better therapy.

49:02.845 --> 49:03.876
Logical.

49:07.433 --> 49:10.102
- Captain Kirk to Mr. Scott.
- Scott here, sir.

49:10.269 --> 49:12.012
Mr. Scott,
how's Lieutenant Romaine?

49:12.187 --> 49:14.144
- Beautiful, captain.
- Yes, Mr. Scott.

49:14.314 --> 49:17.683
Do I take it you say
that she is fit for duty?

49:17.859 --> 49:21.109
- Positively, captain.
- Thank you.

49:21.279 --> 49:23.188
- Kirk to Bridge.
- Sulu, captain.

49:23.364 --> 49:25.357
Mr. Sulu, set course
for Memory Alpha.

49:25.533 --> 49:28.487
Lieutenant Romaine
has a lot of work to do there.

49:28.661 --> 49:32.528
Well, this is an Enterprise first.

49:34.541 --> 49:37.827
Dr. McCoy, Mr. Spock
and Engineer Scott

49:38.003 --> 49:41.039
find themselves
in complete agreement.

49:41.214 --> 49:43.207
Can I stand the strain?
