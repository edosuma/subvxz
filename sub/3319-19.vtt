00:02.610 --> 00:03.525
Previously onMom...

00:03.612 --> 00:04.961
Alvin Lester Biletnikoff.

00:05.048 --> 00:07.355
Who's that?

00:07.442 --> 00:08.486
Your father.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.445
Do you remember Bonnie Plunkett?

00:10.532 --> 00:11.315
Bonnie.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.404
I'm her daughter.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.319
Oh, my God.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.321
I'm your daughter.

00:17.408 --> 00:18.931
Yeah, yeah, I got that.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.848
I can't believe
they found you guilty.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.460
I can. I stole $3 million.

00:25.547 --> 00:29.029
Maybe they'll send you to one of
those swanky country club jails.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.552
Get real. I'm a black woman

00:30.639 --> 00:32.771
who embezzled money
from white people.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.817
I'm going to jailjail.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.863
Someone's gonna buy my ass
for a Kit Kat bar.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.691
Well, it's only fair.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.954
Kit Kat bars helped
build that thing.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.568
I'd like to propose a toast.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.135
To Regina.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.701
Great friend,

00:49.788 --> 00:52.313
sober sister
and convicted felon.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.360
Tomorrow you'll be starting
your prison sentence,

00:56.447 --> 00:59.102
but you'll always be
on parole in my heart.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.324
My turn.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.891
Regina, you embezzled
$3 million

01:05.978 --> 01:07.893
from people who trusted you.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.504
You shouldn't go to jail.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.332
You should go to Wall Street.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.596
To Regina.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.337
Regina.
Yeah.
To Regina.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.816
Hey, look who's here,

01:17.903 --> 01:19.253
taking advantage
of her employee discount.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.430
Well, it's hard to
pass up 50% off.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.431
It's ten percent.

01:23.518 --> 01:24.997
Really?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.348
Everybody
stop eating.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.089
I'm kidding.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.090
Uh, so, what's the occasion?
Somebody's birthday?

01:33.484 --> 01:36.008
Um... no.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.490
Oh. Uh, is it one
of your sober anniversaries?

01:39.577 --> 01:41.971
I just ask 'cause you're the
only people in the restaurant

01:42.058 --> 01:44.147
drinking Shirley Temples
with shots of Red Bull.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.758
No, it's just
a little bon voyage

01:46.845 --> 01:49.196
for our friend Regina.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.241
Oh, wonderful.
Where are you going?

01:51.328 --> 01:52.938
Chowchilla.

01:53.025 --> 01:55.071
Ooh. Sounds fancy.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.987
[laughs]

01:58.074 --> 02:00.250
What's that,
a resort in the Caribbean?

02:00.337 --> 02:01.991
It's a women's prison
near Modesto.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.776
Ah.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.952
To answer your next question,

02:07.039 --> 02:09.041
I killed a nosey maître d'.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.131
Well, uh...

02:11.218 --> 02:13.176
[laughs]

02:13.263 --> 02:14.482
You go, girl.

02:14.569 --> 02:17.398
Uh, bon appétit.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.051
Please tell me

02:19.139 --> 02:21.402
that's not the married boss
you were sleeping with.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.794
It is.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.144
Oh. I pictured him hotter.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.235
Why were you
picturing him at all?

02:28.322 --> 02:31.760
I'm a lonely old woman with a
little cancer and a lot of cats.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.850
What else am I doing?

02:34.937 --> 02:39.028
All righty. Regina, I got you
a little going-away present.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.422
Oh.Oh, honey, you didn't
have to do that.

02:41.509 --> 02:42.727
Ah, just
open it.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.214
What the hell is that?

02:51.301 --> 02:53.042
A metal file for your escape,

02:53.129 --> 02:56.306
or if, you know,
you need to shank somebody.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.830
Thank you, baby.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.484
And the cupcake's gluten-free,

03:00.571 --> 03:02.269
'cause I know
that wheat makes you gassy.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.270
Mmm.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.359
I got you something, too.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.012
Ooh. What's this?

03:07.099 --> 03:08.840
[chuckles]

03:10.102 --> 03:12.888
Seriously? Lube?

03:12.975 --> 03:15.891
In case your cellmate
isn't big on foreplay.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.982
Okay, and this is from me.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.637
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.116
Oh, what a
beautiful journal.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.075
Mm.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.208
I thought you could use it to
chronicle your spiritual growth,

03:28.295 --> 03:31.123
or write poems, or maybe even
pen a novel about your journey.

03:31.211 --> 03:35.084
I'm going to prison,
and you're giving me homework?

03:35.171 --> 03:39.001
Lube's looking better
and better, isn't it?

03:39.088 --> 03:42.004
Well, how are we doing tonight,
ladies?

03:42.091 --> 03:43.397
Everything's
delicious.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.877
Of course it is.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.183
Hello, Bonnie.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.532
Rudy.You're looking well.

03:48.619 --> 03:49.925
Of course I am.

03:50.012 --> 03:50.795
Are you seeing anyone?

03:50.882 --> 03:52.493
Anyone but you.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.931
All right, then.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.760
Excuse me
while I go molest your dessert.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.199
That's the chef
you were fooling around with?

04:03.286 --> 04:04.156
It is, indeed.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.071
Oh. I pictured him taller.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.814
Stop picturing.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.311
I should be back
in time for dinner.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.661
Till then, Violet's in charge.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.489
Where you going?

04:32.576 --> 04:36.493
Um, me and Grandma are taking
a friend of ours to...

04:36.580 --> 04:37.668
visit her sister.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.628
Is her sister in prison, too?

04:41.716 --> 04:44.022
What?

04:44.109 --> 04:46.111
I heard you
on the phone last night.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.939
Then why'd you ask?

04:48.026 --> 04:50.812
To see if you'd lie to me.

04:50.899 --> 04:54.206
Oh, well, you
have your answer.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.512
Ready to go?

04:55.599 --> 04:56.948
Almost.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.950
Hey, Grandma,
where you going?

04:59.037 --> 05:01.083
Taking somebody to prison.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.998
See? It's not so hard.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.611
Violet, we're leaving.VIOLET:Good!

05:12.834 --> 05:13.530
Oh, hi.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.315
Hi.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.621
This is a surprise.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.014
What's going on?

05:19.101 --> 05:20.407
Nothing. Just had
some business in Napa,

05:20.494 --> 05:21.451
and thought
I'd stop by and say "hi."

05:21.538 --> 05:23.453
How's it going, Bonnie?

05:23.540 --> 05:26.021
I hate you, and I
wish you were dead.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.980
You old softy.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.984
Mommy, Daddy, stop.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.947
I'm sorry, but we were just
headed out for the day.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.514
No, I'm sorry.
I should have called.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.429
You're welcome
to stay until we get back.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.300
Get to know
your grandkids.
Really?

05:44.387 --> 05:46.563
Yeah, otherwise, how will
their little hearts be broken

05:46.650 --> 05:48.739
when you desert them
on Christmas Eve?

05:48.826 --> 05:49.784
Mom.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.263
Based on a true story.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.266
Maybe I will stay,

05:54.354 --> 05:55.746
grab a little
quality time.

05:55.833 --> 05:56.486
Great. Roscoe, Grandpa.

05:56.573 --> 05:57.444
Grandpa, Roscoe.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.968
See ya.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.711
Where you headed?

06:03.798 --> 06:06.496
Believe it or not,
I'm taking somebody to prison.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.498
Oh, wow. Gonna
miss you, Bonnie.

06:13.155 --> 06:16.506
It makes me crazy
that you're so nice to him.

06:16.593 --> 06:20.510
I know. Added bonus.

06:20.597 --> 06:24.645
You do know that he wasn't
in the neighborhood on business.

06:24.732 --> 06:25.863
I know.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.082
And it doesn't bother you

06:27.169 --> 06:28.692
that your father's a liar?

06:28.779 --> 06:31.565
My mother managed a whorehouse
in Calgary.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.915
It takes a lot to bother me.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.662
I understand how you
feel about him, but

06:41.749 --> 06:44.360
I want to have my own experience
with my father.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.666
And I don't want
to take that away from you.

06:45.753 --> 06:46.580
Thank you.

06:46.667 --> 06:47.972
[sighs]

06:48.059 --> 06:49.800
What he did
to me was unforgiveable,

06:49.887 --> 06:52.368
but that's certainly
not your problem.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.370
Do you see
what she does?

06:54.457 --> 06:56.372
Don't drag me into this.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.939
But I see it.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.686
Can we just agree
to put our issues aside

07:05.773 --> 07:09.080
and make this day about Regina?

07:09.167 --> 07:10.865
Yeah, let's keep things
light and happy.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.693
Like a trip to prison should be.

07:13.737 --> 07:14.695
There she is.

07:17.872 --> 07:18.742
Dead man walkin'!

07:22.442 --> 07:24.095
What?!
I'm keeping it light!

07:31.276 --> 07:33.278
How's the sandwich?

07:33.365 --> 07:35.063
Good.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.413
Did you know that sandwiches
were named after a guy

07:37.500 --> 07:39.241
called the Earl
of Sandwich?

07:39.328 --> 07:40.808
Really? Do you know him?

07:40.895 --> 07:43.593
No, he died a long time ago.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.551
That's depressing.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.816
Yeah,

07:48.903 --> 07:50.687
but he lives on in your mouth.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.433
So you're my mom's dad.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.434
I am.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.696
And my grandpa.
Yep.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.569
How come
I'm just meeting you now?

08:02.656 --> 08:04.571
Well, uh...

08:04.658 --> 08:06.616
no easy way to say it.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.313
I messed up real bad

08:08.400 --> 08:11.491
and wasn't around when
your mom was growing up.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.754
And I'm really sorry
that I wasn't around

08:13.841 --> 08:15.190
to watch you grow up.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.671
Hmm.

08:17.758 --> 08:18.628
You didn't miss much.

08:26.288 --> 08:29.204
"Chowchilla,
120 miles."

08:29.291 --> 08:31.598
You don't have to keep
calling out the miles!

08:31.685 --> 08:35.123
Wow, bite my head off.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.732
Sorry.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.214
You guys ever think
about reasons

08:39.301 --> 08:40.693
to start drinking again?

08:40.780 --> 08:44.261
You mean like
a zombie apocalypse?

08:44.349 --> 08:45.829
You're kidding.Nope.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.223
Got a whole list of things
to drink over:

08:48.310 --> 08:50.965
zombie apocalypse, my kids
are stolen by gypsies,

08:51.052 --> 08:54.664
I have a stroke
and forget how to masturbate.

08:54.751 --> 08:57.885
What if something horrible
happened to me?

08:57.972 --> 09:01.715
I'd get through it.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.413
You're not planning on drinking

09:04.500 --> 09:06.110
while you're in prison, are you?

09:06.197 --> 09:09.157
No, I'm gonna wait
until something bad
happens to me.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.857
Just remember, they hold lots
of meetings in there.

09:13.944 --> 09:17.948
You just have to make it
your business to go.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.342
Yeah, and meetings might be
a good place to make friends

09:20.429 --> 09:21.735
with the Aryan Nation chicks.
Talk about a meet-cute.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.435
How would you drink in jail,
anyway?

09:26.522 --> 09:28.611
Oh, that's easy.
Toilet wine.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.701
What's toilet wine?

09:31.788 --> 09:33.703
Oranges, raisins,
ketchup, sugar,

09:33.790 --> 09:35.836
and a sock filled
with moldy bread,

09:35.923 --> 09:38.665
all marinating in a toilet
for a week.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.058
Ugh!

09:41.145 --> 09:42.756
Well, it gets the job done

09:42.843 --> 09:45.846
and you can trade your
surplus for cigarettes.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.762
I wish I knew you
back in the day.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.590
I don't think so.

09:50.677 --> 09:51.765
You would've been my bitch.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.158
And I work my bitches hard.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.032
Hey, look!

09:58.119 --> 10:00.512
Hootie and the Blowfish
are at the Chumash Casino!

10:05.300 --> 10:06.170
How's the sandwich?

10:06.257 --> 10:07.868
Good.

10:07.955 --> 10:11.045
You know that, uh,
sandwiches are named after

10:11.132 --> 10:13.221
the Earl of Sandwich?

10:15.092 --> 10:17.268
That's terrific.

10:17.355 --> 10:18.748
So, what's your deal?

10:18.835 --> 10:20.620
My deal?You don't really think

10:20.707 --> 10:22.534
you're gonna show up
out of nowhere

10:22.622 --> 10:23.579
and suddenly play grandpa.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.016
No, of course not.

10:26.103 --> 10:29.063
But I am hoping, in time,
to get to know you

10:29.150 --> 10:31.065
and maybe be somebody
you can count on.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.936
And how exactly would that work?

10:33.023 --> 10:35.112
Well, after
the baby's born,

10:35.199 --> 10:36.940
I can change a
diaper, babysit,
whatever you need.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.159
I won't need any of that.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.030
Yeah, you say
that now,

10:40.117 --> 10:42.250
but it does
take a village.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.209
My mom didn't tell you?

10:45.296 --> 10:48.169
I'm giving the baby up
for adoption.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.606
Really?

10:50.693 --> 10:51.215
Really.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.740
Wow.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.656
Sure you want
to do that?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.179
What's that supposed to mean?

10:58.266 --> 11:00.703
I just mean, have you
thought it through?

11:00.790 --> 11:03.184
No, I'm just gonna abandon it
like you did my mother.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.275
I know you're
being sarcastic,

11:07.362 --> 11:09.277
but that's exactly
why I'm asking.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.887
Not being there
for your mother

11:10.974 --> 11:12.236
is my biggest
regret.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.498
Yeah?

11:13.585 --> 11:14.543
Well, I won't have any regrets,

11:14.630 --> 11:15.718
because I'm making sure

11:15.805 --> 11:17.372
that my baby has a great life.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.678
I... I'm not
saying that...

11:18.765 --> 11:20.592
No, you don't get
to say anything.

11:25.989 --> 11:26.903
All right, listen,
I'm sorry...

11:26.990 --> 11:28.296
Save it.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.385
I'm just coming back
for my sandwich.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.694
Even meaner than
her grandmother.

11:38.915 --> 11:42.310
You know what the worst thing
about going to prison is?

11:44.268 --> 11:45.705
You're
in prison?

11:47.576 --> 11:48.577
No.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.319
I'm gonna miss seeing

11:51.406 --> 11:52.755
my little boy grow up.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.323
Oh.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.586
I'll stop
talking now.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.719
Don't say it
unless you mean it.

12:01.808 --> 12:02.852
When was the last time
you saw him?

12:02.939 --> 12:05.855
Just before the trial.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.814
That was months ago.Yeah.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.991
His father won't
let me near him.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.470
I can't blame him.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.691
Wait, so you didn't
get to say good-bye?

12:17.040 --> 12:18.389
No.

12:18.476 --> 12:19.782
Oh, that's awful.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.524
He just had his tenth birthday.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.834
He'll be a teenager
by the time I get out.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.838
Where do
they live?

12:33.404 --> 12:34.754
Back in Stockton.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.627
Well,
screw that.

12:38.714 --> 12:39.759
What are you doing?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.195
We're going
to Stockton!

12:41.282 --> 12:42.936
But I'll be late
for turning myself in.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.067
What are they gonna do?

12:44.154 --> 12:45.112
Throw you in jail?

12:52.989 --> 12:54.948
[whispering]

13:01.737 --> 13:03.695
Uh, may I help you?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.393
Yes, hi.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.960
Sorry to bother you,
but we used to live here.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.049
Really?

13:09.136 --> 13:11.878
This house is brand-new.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.445
Yes, thisone is...

13:14.532 --> 13:15.620
And it's beautiful.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.535
...but before it was built,

13:17.622 --> 13:20.234
there was another house here
that was torn down.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.497
'Cause of the murder.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.368
A murder?

13:24.455 --> 13:26.153
Th-That wasn't disclosed to me
when I bought this place.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.894
That's why they built new.

13:27.981 --> 13:31.811
Well, that and...
the ghost problem.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.160
Are you related?

13:35.553 --> 13:37.817
She's my mom.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
And she's my mom.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.042
Anyway, uh, we
were just hoping

13:46.129 --> 13:49.437
we could come inside
and take a look around.

13:49.524 --> 13:50.786
For old times' sake.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.527
Yeah, I suppose.

13:52.614 --> 13:53.528
A murder, huh?

13:53.615 --> 13:55.617
Murders.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.968
I always pictured him shirtless,

13:59.055 --> 14:00.796
fresh from mowing the lawn.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.537
[mouthing]

14:08.282 --> 14:10.240
[door closes]

14:12.329 --> 14:13.809
All right, look,

14:13.896 --> 14:15.985
I know that it's weird
to wake up one day

14:16.072 --> 14:17.639
and find out
you have a grandfather

14:17.726 --> 14:18.901
you never knew existed.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.076
That happened
to you, too?

14:22.209 --> 14:24.515
I just want you both to know

14:24.602 --> 14:26.866
I don't expect you to love me
or anything like that.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.085
I-I just want a chance
to be here for you

14:29.172 --> 14:30.695
and do whatever I can.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.221
I guess that's fair.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.527
I also need to
apologize to you.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.356
It was very stupid of me

14:39.443 --> 14:41.054
to think that I know
better than you

14:41.141 --> 14:42.011
when it comes to putting
your baby up for adoption.

14:42.098 --> 14:44.927
What's he
talking about?

14:45.014 --> 14:46.320
Thanks a lot.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.364
Hadn't told
him yet.

14:49.366 --> 14:52.239
I'm sorry you had
to hear it like this.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.196
But I was gonna
be an uncle.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.111
I know, but...

14:55.198 --> 14:57.635
this is better
for the baby.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.593
You suck!

14:58.680 --> 15:00.377
Roscoe, wait.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.296
[door slams]

15:07.689 --> 15:09.386
[sighs]

15:09.473 --> 15:12.085
Guess we're not gonna
go play putt-putt tonight.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.264
Oh, thank you so much.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.657
This really
helped.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.137
Yes, it's nice
to have some closure.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.747
Yeah.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.140
Still might want to get
a priest in there,

15:24.227 --> 15:25.185
sprinkle a little holy water.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.664
Yeah.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.275
Yeah, wandering souls

15:28.362 --> 15:30.886
can screw up
your satellite reception.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.757
All right, well,
that's some good advice.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.194
Have a good day.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.804
Easy for
you to say.

15:35.891 --> 15:37.023
I'm going
to prison.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.589
Regina?

15:38.676 --> 15:40.678
Don't you ever
keep my son from me again.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.811
'Cause I got friends
on the outside.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.957
BONNIE:
Mom!

16:03.353 --> 16:04.833
It's weird.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.356
Doesn't feel like a prison.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.402
That's because you're leaving.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.753
Hey, did you know
you get an hour

16:11.840 --> 16:13.320
of free recreation time
outside every day?

16:13.407 --> 16:15.844
Oh, Mom.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.715
What?
I don't even get that.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.285
Regina Thompkins?

16:24.896 --> 16:25.810
Right here.

16:25.897 --> 16:26.333
Let's go.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.990
Okay.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.603
All right, I'm gonna
say my good-byes.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.213
And I will slap

16:37.300 --> 16:38.867
the first one of you
that starts crying.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.919
Christy...

16:48.007 --> 16:49.225
if you hadn't
talked me out of

16:49.312 --> 16:51.271
bailing on my
first AA meeting...

16:53.447 --> 16:55.275
...I'd probably be
dead right now.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.018
[sniffs]

16:59.105 --> 17:00.932
You gave me
a second chance

17:01.020 --> 17:03.631
and I will never stop
thanking you for it.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.029
[crying]:
You're welcome.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.031
Don't slap me.

17:12.117 --> 17:14.076
[Regina laughs]

17:16.339 --> 17:18.515
And Marjorie...

17:18.602 --> 17:20.952
Girl, you're
my rock.

17:22.301 --> 17:25.000
You see the good
in everything.

17:27.481 --> 17:31.006
Even while you're
fighting breast cancer...

17:31.093 --> 17:32.964
all you do is
think of others.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.401
I love you,
Regina.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.709
I love you, too.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.407
[sniffs]

17:40.494 --> 17:42.757
Don't you
die on me.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.063
I won't.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.282
Don't you drink.

17:46.369 --> 17:47.327
I won't.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.069
[exhales]

17:50.156 --> 17:51.418
Don't forget to sleep
with your shoes on.

17:51.505 --> 17:54.073
You never know when
you'll have to run.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.949
And you...

18:02.994 --> 18:05.867
I think I'm gonna miss you
most of all, Scarecrow.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.351
I know I bag on you,

18:11.438 --> 18:14.789
but you're one of
the strongest women I know.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.316
I watched you fall hard,

18:20.403 --> 18:24.146
but you picked yourself up
and... started over.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.365
I admire you

18:25.452 --> 18:26.975
so much for that.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.804
[crying]:
Oh, God, why do you have to go?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.066
It's okay, baby.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.372
I'll be out before you know it.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.113
No, you won't.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.158
You're gonna be
in there forever!

18:37.464 --> 18:40.206
Time's up.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.209
[exhales]

18:46.777 --> 18:47.387
Okay.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.607
Okay.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.044
Bye.
Bye.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.102
[sniffs]

19:12.412 --> 19:14.501
It's funny...

19:14.588 --> 19:17.547
I always thought it'd be you
I'd be dropping off.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.166
Oh, crap.

19:27.253 --> 19:27.775
Forgot
about him.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.690
Be nice.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.082
I'm always nice.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.736
Oh, look, we got a garden gnome.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.220
Have fun with the grandkids?

19:38.307 --> 19:39.265
Oh, sure, sure.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.309
We're making baby steps

19:40.396 --> 19:41.484
in the right direction.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.094
Why are you sitting out here?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.836
Ah, needed some fresh air...

19:45.923 --> 19:48.970
and your daughter took
the opportunity to lock me out.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.319
Why?

19:50.406 --> 19:51.973
I kind of spilled the beans

19:52.060 --> 19:53.104
about the adoption to Roscoe.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.194
Violet's giving away the baby?

19:55.281 --> 19:56.630
Oh, God, you didn't know either?

19:56.717 --> 19:58.458
I'm screwing with you,
numb-nuts.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.591
Why don't you stay for dinner?

20:01.678 --> 20:02.766
We'll straighten this all out.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.986
No, I've imposed enough.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.901
I-I should
get going.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.163
Alvin, wait.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.470
Yeah?

20:10.557 --> 20:11.688
Why'd you really
stop by this morning?

20:11.775 --> 20:15.214
You didn't buy the whole

20:15.301 --> 20:17.172
"I had business
in the neighborhood" thing?

20:17.259 --> 20:18.695
Not for a second.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.784
[sighs]

20:21.829 --> 20:22.960
My wife threw me out.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.267
I had nowhere else to go.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.616
Yes! Karma!

20:26.703 --> 20:30.185
Stop.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.492
Please,
come on inside.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.320
No, you know...

20:34.407 --> 20:36.409
your kids aren't real happy
with me right now.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.801
Really?
They love me.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.064
Come on.

20:40.151 --> 20:41.979
So what do you think? You gonna
lose everything in the divorce?

20:42.066 --> 20:44.678
I only ask 'cause that and ball
cancer is what I prayed for.
