00:50.884 --> 00:55.806
You know, I think that may have beenthe best Elderspryte weekend ever.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.391
What you got there, Blip?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.478
My great-uncle Coyle got me a gravity egg.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.897
But it's a bit fiddly.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.192
Hey!

01:09.653 --> 01:13.031
My precious leaves! Blip, turn it off!

01:13.824 --> 01:14.825
Hang on a sec.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.089
-Xandra!-What?

01:34.261 --> 01:35.721
Our poor dorm.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.515
It's ruined.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.101
Who would do something like this?

01:41.185 --> 01:42.603
Norman?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.563
Hello.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.607
I know who it was.

01:47.316 --> 01:48.525
It was Tali.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.068
No!

01:50.152 --> 01:51.570
How do you know?

01:51.653 --> 01:53.864
She gave me a look.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.658
That's just like her.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.994
Even for Tali, this is low.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.537
Hold on a sec.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.165
Perhaps we should investigate furtherbefore we--

02:03.248 --> 02:06.418
Yeah, sure, sure. Or we prank 'em.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.669
"Prankem"?

02:07.753 --> 02:11.006
They prank us, we'll prank 'em back.It's only fair.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.591
I love pranks!

02:12.674 --> 02:16.220
What about a prank phone call?On a telephone?

02:16.303 --> 02:19.556
"Tefelome"? What's a tefelome?

02:36.365 --> 02:39.701
Hey, can you itch my antlers for me?I can't reach.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.288
When's lunchtime? I just want to go eat.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.548
Ring, ring! Ring, ring! Ring, ring!

02:53.382 --> 02:55.425
Ring, ring! Ring, ring!

02:57.427 --> 02:59.263
Ring, ring! Ring, ring!

03:07.396 --> 03:09.982
Hello there, spryteling.

03:10.065 --> 03:14.236
It is I, Professor Luxcraft.Are you listening?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.905
Yes, sir. Am I in trouble?

03:16.989 --> 03:21.285
The trouble you're in is so deep,I can barely see the bottom.

03:21.368 --> 03:25.455
Now, what I need you to do issing me an "I'm sorry" song.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.332
An "I'm sorry" song?

03:28.292 --> 03:31.712
Yes, and stand on one leg.

03:33.005 --> 03:38.093
I'm sorry, la, la, laVery sorry, la, la, la

03:38.177 --> 03:43.015
La, la, laSorry for whatever I've done

03:45.726 --> 03:47.186
My turn, my turn!

03:47.269 --> 03:48.520
Ring, ring!

03:48.604 --> 03:49.980
-Hello?-Hello!

03:50.063 --> 03:52.649
My name is Gordon.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.277
Are you having a nice day?

03:56.153 --> 04:01.450
Well, no one's ever actually asked.It's so nice to finally--

04:01.533 --> 04:03.368
My name's not really Gordon!

04:08.624 --> 04:11.919
I'm bad! I'm rotten.

04:12.002 --> 04:17.257
All right, that was a good warm-up,but now we really gotta prank 'em.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.593
Oh, yeah? What do you have in mind?

04:19.676 --> 04:23.555
Hey, Blip. Can I borrow your gravity egg?

04:32.314 --> 04:36.610
I'm telling you, it spoke to me.Its name is Gordon.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.496
Xandra? Is that you?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.414
You're in trouble now.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.959
As soon as I get down from here,I'm gonna...

04:56.421 --> 05:00.425
Whatever you lotthink you're doing, don't.

05:00.509 --> 05:04.847
You should be getting ready for bed.It's lights-out in 15 minutes.

05:04.930 --> 05:05.931
Yeah, yeah.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.140
I heard that.

05:07.224 --> 05:11.895
You sprytes better watch it,or I'll put you on... the list.

05:14.690 --> 05:19.987
That's right. Now hurry along.Lights-out in 14 minutes!

05:20.946 --> 05:25.450
Okay, I'll admit, the gravity egg thingwas way better than the prank call.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.327
Thank you, thank you.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.037
Xandra.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.668
Water orbs?

05:55.606 --> 06:00.152
What is the meaning of this?You're all supposed to be in bed!

06:00.235 --> 06:01.361
Whoopsies!

06:05.449 --> 06:07.034
That's it!

06:16.543 --> 06:19.838
Good! You're all here.I think I may be onto something that--

06:19.922 --> 06:21.798
Hey, Blip. What's this?

06:21.882 --> 06:25.302
What? That? I don't know.That's not what I want to show you.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.346
-It's the---Well, where did it come from?

06:27.429 --> 06:31.225
-Blip, didn't you see who left it here?-No. I've been very focused on my--

06:31.308 --> 06:33.227
-It's a present!-Sprout, no!

06:37.189 --> 06:39.566
It is so on.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.564
Glitter dolphin!

07:53.932 --> 07:57.311
We've got to think of a great wayto get Tali back.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.480
Come on, Sprout. Think, think, think.

08:00.564 --> 08:04.067
If only I had some blue mash.That always helps me think.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.446
Did you say blue mash?

08:32.888 --> 08:35.224
-Ready!-Gordon?

08:35.307 --> 08:36.517
Now, Sprout!

08:44.191 --> 08:45.692
Shut it down, Sprout.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.111
Oh, no.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.115
I said shut it down. Sprout?

08:55.494 --> 08:56.537
Uh-oh.

08:59.957 --> 09:03.502
Do I hear lights on during lights-out?

09:08.257 --> 09:10.384
Miscreants! Miscreants!

09:23.897 --> 09:25.691
-Hello.-Norman!

09:44.668 --> 09:50.007
I'm gonna spend the rest of my lifepranking you, Xandra.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.217
Sounds like you wishyou never started all this.

09:52.301 --> 09:55.929
What are you talking about?We didn't start this, you did.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.556
You trashed our room!

09:57.639 --> 09:58.640
No, we didn't!

09:58.724 --> 09:59.766
Yes, you did.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.226
No, we didn't!

10:01.310 --> 10:02.728
Yes, you did!

10:03.353 --> 10:04.730
No, they didn't.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.776
I knew something seemed offthe moment we came in.

10:09.860 --> 10:14.198
While you lot were jumping to conclusions,I began my investigation.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.992
My first clue was the wilted leaves.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.621
I knew Sprout would never neglecthis plants like that,

10:20.704 --> 10:23.415
and Tali wouldn't have wilted themon purpose.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.877
Next, I discovered this rusty spoon.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.046
Now, spoons don't just rust overnight,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.965
and I used this very spoonnary two days ago.

10:32.049 --> 10:35.802
I found these peculiar teeth markson the bed.

10:37.054 --> 10:40.307
And then it allstarted to fall into place.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.894
I have one final experiment to conductto prove my theory.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.075
Just as I suspected.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.159
What?

10:59.952 --> 11:00.953
Disarrays.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.333
I'd say at least two different types.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.336
But what would disarrays be doingin our room?

11:09.419 --> 11:12.256
I believe they must have beenlooking for something.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.592
Or someone.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.512
I told you it wasn't us.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.014
Sorry. I should've believed you.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.645
Professor Luxcraft?

11:29.857 --> 11:31.024
Wolfboy.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.736
Wolfboy...

11:36.321 --> 11:37.739
why are you all blue?

11:55.007 --> 11:57.259
So, what did Sneffton say exactly?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.803
Just that Luxcraft wants to see me.

11:59.887 --> 12:03.390
And in the middle of all the cleanup too.How convenient.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.434
I don't like this one bit, Wolfy.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.854
You're going to miss breakfast.And we have Bird Lab later.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.107
I really wanted to show youthe woodpecker I've been working on.

12:12.191 --> 12:16.361
Sorry, Sprout. But I've got to go.He might finally give me some answers.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.906
-Well, ask him where he's been.-I will.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.408
-And tell us everything when you're back.-I will!

12:33.712 --> 12:35.339
Where is it? Where is it?

12:37.966 --> 12:41.303
Professor Luxcraft, is everything okay?

12:42.054 --> 12:45.098
Yes, fine and dandelions, my boy.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.725
Have you lost something?

12:46.808 --> 12:51.522
No, no. It's exactly where I left it.Just need to remember where that was.

12:52.231 --> 12:56.527
Well, I'm glad you're back and all,but I do have some questions.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.863
I mean, one day you're telling meI have these powers...

13:00.948 --> 13:02.282
and then you up and vanish.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.993
Next thing I know,you're flopping in through our window.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.245
Was that a question?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.915
Well, my question is, where have you been?

13:09.998 --> 13:11.500
Been? Where haven't I been?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.794
I've been all over.Been and gone and been again.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.129
But we've no timeto discuss my beens, boy.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.299
There's something else.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.760
I found a memory.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.097
It was from when I was younger.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.059
You were there.You wanted to bring me here.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.938
And you said--you said something about a prophecy.

13:33.021 --> 13:36.024
Funny old things, memories.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.406
Sir, please.

13:42.489 --> 13:46.785
Has this prophecy got something to dowith me or my powers?

13:46.869 --> 13:49.371
I understand you're itching for answers,

13:49.454 --> 13:51.540
and you will have themwhen the time is right.

13:51.623 --> 13:55.544
But first, we need to have a serious chatabout those powers of yours.

13:55.627 --> 13:59.006
How are they coming along?Have you been practicing?

13:59.089 --> 14:01.508
Discovering what you're capable of?

14:01.592 --> 14:04.219
I made a rabbit! Sort of.

14:04.303 --> 14:06.847
-A rabbit?-Sort of.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.640
A demonstration, perhaps.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.854
Now, what could that be?

14:14.897 --> 14:16.607
It's a piece of paper, sir.

14:16.690 --> 14:21.278
Not what it is now. What could it become?Use your imagination, boy.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.698
A parrot?

14:25.199 --> 14:26.200
Very good.

14:26.783 --> 14:31.246
Not much life in her, is there?Is it resting? What's your name, parrot?

14:31.330 --> 14:34.333
Sir, it's not really a parrot.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.376
Not with that attitude.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.630
Now, parrots are supposed to fly,are they not?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.507
All the parrots I know certainly do.

14:41.590 --> 14:45.802
Why don't you use these powers of yoursand make this one fly?

14:56.146 --> 14:58.690
I see we have some work to do.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.985
I'm sorry, sir. It works sometimes.

15:02.069 --> 15:06.031
But other times, I can't getthose little wisp thingies to show up.

15:06.114 --> 15:10.244
Yes, the wisps can be... fickle.

15:10.327 --> 15:14.206
But if the wisps won't come to you,then we must go to them.

15:20.671 --> 15:21.964
Where does this go?

15:22.047 --> 15:23.674
Only one way to find out.

15:26.385 --> 15:30.472
Curiouser and curiouser and curiouser.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.570
Professor Luxcraft?

15:44.653 --> 15:48.532
Wasn't that fun? Limbs intact?Two, three, four. Good. Now come.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.786
It's so dark. I can't see anything.

15:53.579 --> 15:56.456
But that's howcreativity always starts, isn't it?

15:56.540 --> 16:02.004
Stumbling through the darkness,searching for that glimmer of inspiration.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.260
What is this place?

16:08.760 --> 16:11.555
I've never seen so many wisps.

16:11.638 --> 16:16.018
Yes, well, I believe we must beclose to the heart of the factory.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.102
The heart?

16:17.186 --> 16:20.063
Sprytes have used wispsto bring our creations to life

16:20.147 --> 16:23.901
since the beginning of time, but we'venever discovered where they come from.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.903
They must come from somewhere.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.155
"The heart of the factory."

16:28.238 --> 16:30.115
-Precisely.-Can I see it?

16:31.325 --> 16:34.828
My dear boy, nobody knows where it is.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.914
Well, how do you know it exists?

16:36.997 --> 16:39.208
Well, everything has a heart.

16:40.584 --> 16:43.337
Now, forming a bond with the wisps

16:43.420 --> 16:47.007
is the first step to honingyour own creative powers.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.091
A bond?

16:48.175 --> 16:51.053
To control the wisps,you must understand them.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.014
And they must understand you.

16:56.350 --> 16:58.727
They seem to havetaken an interest in you already.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.188
Come on, wispies. Come to me.

17:08.362 --> 17:12.532
If they're so interested in me,why can't I control them like you do?

17:12.616 --> 17:15.993
Well, I've hada little more practice than you.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.830
But we must start small.Where's that bird of yours?

17:21.083 --> 17:24.502
Now concentrate.Cast all other thoughts from your mind.

17:29.383 --> 17:32.052
Sense the wisps around you.

17:36.974 --> 17:40.519
Now, wisps, now! Make it fly.

17:43.564 --> 17:46.316
My dear boy,the wisps aren't yours to command.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.776
They cannot be rushed.

17:47.860 --> 17:53.448
Think of it as a collaboration,a conversation.

17:53.532 --> 17:57.411
How can I have a conversationif they won't listen to me?

17:57.494 --> 18:00.998
How can you have a conversationif you won't listen to them?

18:01.582 --> 18:02.583
Go ahead, my boy.

18:06.295 --> 18:11.425
All right, wisps, listen up.The truth is, I think we could be friends.

18:11.508 --> 18:15.095
Now, if you'll just gointo this parrot for me...

18:15.179 --> 18:17.556
You must open up to them.Let your guard down.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.184
Let them see who you really are.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.394
Can't you just tell me how to do it?

18:22.895 --> 18:25.731
I cannot simply give you the answer.

18:25.814 --> 18:29.401
We must all discover our own uniqueconnection to the creative energy.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.111
Well, how do I do that?

18:31.195 --> 18:36.074
That, my boy,is between you and the wisps.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.494
But I don't even know where to start. I--

18:40.078 --> 18:43.248
Professor? Professor?

18:45.083 --> 18:46.793
Well, that's just great.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.135
Floof, beard me.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.057
Hello there, my dear little wisps.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.892
Flerberty, flabbity.

19:01.975 --> 19:05.437
Would you mind awfully bonding with me?

19:10.108 --> 19:11.235
Come on.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.404
Pretty please?

19:17.366 --> 19:18.742
Look, will you just--

19:24.957 --> 19:26.583
Just, please!

19:27.709 --> 19:29.086
What's the use?

19:31.880 --> 19:34.299
Come on, little wolf.

20:22.890 --> 20:26.059
There you go. That's it. Incredible.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.106
That's it, little wolf!

20:31.190 --> 20:33.692
-Don't stop, don't stop.-Am I doing it?

20:33.775 --> 20:36.528
You are, my boy, you are.

20:36.612 --> 20:40.574
Now, channel them into the bird.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.498
It's working!

20:59.051 --> 21:01.470
I knew it! I knew it!

21:05.098 --> 21:07.267
Steady now. Steady.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.111
That's enough, boy.

21:25.661 --> 21:27.621
What happened?

21:27.704 --> 21:30.624
-Are you okay, Professor?-Oh, yes, yes. I'm fine.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.085
All is fine and dandelions.

21:33.168 --> 21:36.964
You just let your imaginationrun away with you a little, that's all.

21:37.965 --> 21:40.300
There can no longer be any doubt.

21:40.384 --> 21:43.971
-You are the child the prophecy spoke of.-So there is a prophecy!

21:44.054 --> 21:47.933
It speaks of a human child who,at a time of great darkness,

21:48.016 --> 21:50.102
will restore balance to the world.

21:50.185 --> 21:52.479
-Darkness?-The disarrays.

21:52.563 --> 21:56.108
They grow stronger by the day.I've seen it with my own eyes.

21:56.191 --> 22:00.821
That's where you've been all this time.You were spying on the disarrays.

22:00.904 --> 22:03.073
You must learnto control your imagination,

22:03.156 --> 22:05.450
to hone your powers.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.829
-And I will teach you.-All right, I'm in.

22:08.912 --> 22:12.541
This is so cool.I can't wait to tell Xandra and Sprout.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.418
Dear boy, this is not a game.

22:14.501 --> 22:18.714
We are dealing with the forces of chaos,the essence of destruction.

22:18.797 --> 22:21.967
If anyone were to discover who you were...

22:22.509 --> 22:26.054
I would just be very careful aboutwho you confide in,

22:26.138 --> 22:28.223
for their safety as well as yours.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.100
Their safety?

22:30.184 --> 22:32.519
Now,I think that's quite enough for today.

22:32.603 --> 22:34.104
You'd best get back to your dorm.

22:34.188 --> 22:37.608
We will reconvene on the morrowand begin your training.

22:45.449 --> 22:48.076
But then comes a gust of wind

22:48.160 --> 22:50.954
and I'm like-- Wolfy, you're back!

22:51.038 --> 22:52.789
Can't you take care of that thing?

22:52.873 --> 22:54.124
My bird!

22:54.917 --> 22:56.585
And it's gone.

22:56.668 --> 22:59.505
So, how did it go with Luxcraft?What did he say?

23:07.054 --> 23:08.055
It went okay.

23:08.138 --> 23:13.101
He just told me to lay low, as usual.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.062
Anyway, how was Bird Lab?

23:15.145 --> 23:18.148
Whoa! You're jumping ahead there, Wolfy.

23:18.232 --> 23:22.986
Well, after you left, I brushed my teethand then I washed my leaf

23:23.070 --> 23:26.198
and then I was like,"What packed lunch will I take?"
