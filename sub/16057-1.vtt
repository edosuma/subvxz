01:13.120 --> 01:14.519
Whoo-hoo!

01:14.720 --> 01:17.518
100,000. Shall we poke our nose
into space, Frank?

01:17.760 --> 01:21.309
That's enough. Approaching
heat barrier. Let's level off.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.717
Recover One, this is Falcon.
Beginning descent now.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.908
Roger, Daedalus.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.872
Got you on the scope, Frank.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.238
Miss October.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.435
Bing. 110,000th floor,
ladies' lingerie.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.033
You catch that, Hawk?

02:05.400 --> 02:08.597
She's all right. She's just
talking to me, that's all.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.114
You trust me, don't you?

02:10.440 --> 02:12.237
We're taking her down.
That's an order.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.351
Oh, here we go again.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.228
Frank, look at that.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.511
That's where we're going.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.640
I don't know how
and I don't know when but...

02:29.480 --> 02:34.235
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars

02:40.920 --> 02:41.909
Come on, baby.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.115
You want to get out
and give us a push?

03:01.920 --> 03:03.478
We got to eject!

03:03.680 --> 03:06.319
At 112,000 feet?
Are you out of your mind?

03:10.080 --> 03:12.196
No choice.
We're not riding this one out.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.755
Call mayday!
We're popping! We're popping!

03:15.000 --> 03:17.992
- I'm not losing another ship.
- Don't think about it.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.189
Just do it!

03:24.120 --> 03:26.759
I'll count down to one.
You ready? One.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.195
Oh, shit!

03:43.080 --> 03:46.117
Crazy son of a bitch almost
landed like a bug on a windshield.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.753
This is it!

03:57.960 --> 04:01.236
First one down wins the prize!

04:47.920 --> 04:48.989
Whoo-hoo!

04:49.200 --> 04:51.760
112,000 feet and I feel fine!

04:54.760 --> 04:57.399
You've always got to push things
to the limit.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.798
That's what I do best, Frank.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.508
Get off me!

05:09.240 --> 05:11.800
Come on, you guys! Break it up!

05:12.520 --> 05:13.839
Come on.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.032
Is that smoke I smell?

05:28.720 --> 05:30.517
Looks like a fire out by Ridgecrest.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.357
We crashed the X-2.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.159
My $4 million X-2?

05:38.360 --> 05:40.430
Is that the X-2 you're referring to?

05:42.640 --> 05:45.677
We did break both speed
and altitude records, sir.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.592
And beat the free-fall mark
by 30,000 feet.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.756
Three planes in 10 months.
That's bound to be a record too.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.478
The engine failed. The aircraft went
in a flat spin. We couldn't recover.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.996
But you made it.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.999
That's the important thing.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.071
And you made it...

06:10.760 --> 06:12.637
...just in time, Frank.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.277
Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

06:17.480 --> 06:22.190
...I'm Major Bob Gerson, United States
Air Force, and I hold in my hand...

06:23.000 --> 06:26.913
...a directive from the president
of the United States of America.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.069
It reads:

06:29.280 --> 06:32.238
" Effective immediately,
the Air Force's involvement...

06:32.440 --> 06:35.159
...in outer atmosphere
testing and exploration...

06:35.360 --> 06:37.112
...is hereby terminated.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.112
A new civilian agency...

06:39.320 --> 06:43.393
...the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, is this day chartered.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.438
Project Daedalus is now complete...

06:46.680 --> 06:48.830
...and designated
Mission Accomplished."

06:49.080 --> 06:50.593
The Air Force is out?

06:50.960 --> 06:52.313
What about the pilots?

06:52.600 --> 06:54.875
Who will be
the first American in space?

06:55.080 --> 06:58.834
A decision has been made.
After an exhaustive search...

06:59.920 --> 07:03.390
...we've identified who can best
carry out a mission of this magnitude.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.030
This job calls for toughness,
both mental and physical toughness...

07:07.240 --> 07:10.596
...and in the tradition of
the best of the Air Force...

07:11.040 --> 07:13.600
...an ability to follow orders
to the letter.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.432
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Maryanne...

07:17.680 --> 07:20.638
...the first American
to cross into outer space.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.913
Look, Frank.
She wants to shake your hand.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.428
You bastard.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.229
Shake her hand for the cameras, Frank.
That is an order.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.274
It just isn't responding.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.358
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
mission director Sara Holland.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.830
She's been monitoring
the situation closely...

08:26.040 --> 08:28.759
...and she assures me
that the problem is well in hand.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.111
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.948
As you may know, 11 days ago,
atmospheric tracking determined...

08:36.159 --> 08:38.674
...that Russian communications
satellite Ikon...

08:38.880 --> 08:41.394
...has initiated orbital degradation.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.438
Computer trajectory models
predict a steady acceleration...

08:44.680 --> 08:47.069
...in sequence with
the gravitational constant.

08:47.280 --> 08:51.239
There's a systems failure in online
navigation and guidance avionics.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.113
All redundant systems
are non-responsive.

08:54.320 --> 08:58.598
Without active course correction
in the next 30 to 40 days...

08:58.800 --> 09:01.394
...the satellite will reenter
the Earth's atmosphere.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.079
And crash?

09:05.120 --> 09:08.430
General, Ikon has given you
14 years of service.

09:08.640 --> 09:12.189
That is in the performance range
of a communications satellite.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.870
It will probably crash in the ocean
or burn up in the atmosphere.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.831
I think it's best that we let it.

09:21.760 --> 09:26.197
My country's grateful for the efforts
of NASA and the State Department.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.710
However, losing Ikon is not an option.

09:29.920 --> 09:34.152
Ikon is not just a communications
satellite to the Russian Federation.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.677
Ikon is the communications satellite.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.909
You are undoubtedly aware
of our restructuring programs.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.475
Losing all telecommunications...

09:44.680 --> 09:49.151
...until we're able to replace Ikon
could plunge us into chaos.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.349
And perhaps even civil war.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.957
Hard to believe you fellas
only have one bird up there.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.475
Couldn't we just
transfer the workload?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.711
Gene. Excuse me, Sara.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.357
We have a presidential mandate
to assist the Russians...

10:11.960 --> 10:14.758
...our partners in
the International Space Station.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.117
And I assure you
that we will fix this problem.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.672
It's just a glitch.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.114
You are feeding these guys
bold-faced lies.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.629
It's a waste of money
and my staff's time.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.910
Sara, you're one hell
of an engineer...

10:29.120 --> 10:31.634
...but you don't know jack-shit
about politics.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.633
Helping the Russians save face
is an act of good faith.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.910
How can you put a price on that?

10:42.880 --> 10:45.394
This thing is dumb as a post.
It's dead in the air.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.873
Kid, why don't you stop trying
to talk to the satellite?

10:49.080 --> 10:51.230
You have the code.
Override the guidance system.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.875
You want to figure that mess out?

10:55.080 --> 10:57.548
The guidance system on this thing
is a dinosaur.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.194
Even these guys don't understand it.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.550
It's pre-microprocessor.
It's pre-everything.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.910
Whoever designed this
Byzantine piece of shit...

11:05.120 --> 11:07.156
...is probably chopping rocks
in Siberia.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.749
Ethan, can I access the Skylab files
from here?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.319
Yeah.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.915
What does that have
to do with anything?

11:15.200 --> 11:18.988
A fine politician, but you don't
know jack-shit about engineering.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.989
This is the guidance system
from Skylab.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.878
That's not possible.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.389
Maybe there's similarities,
but they can't be the same.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.438
I'm looking up the designer.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.630
Hell. Don't bother.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.790
It was Francis D. Corvin.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.515
Is he dead?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.238
Only if I'm lucky.

11:49.920 --> 11:53.435
Would you like me to read
the instructions to you again?

11:56.200 --> 11:58.475
Let me tell you something, my dear.

11:58.880 --> 12:03.192
A fella in Japan wrote those
instructions when he made this thing.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.914
They were probably translated
by some gringo...

12:06.120 --> 12:09.430
...an expatriate American who
couldn't get a job in this country.

12:10.760 --> 12:15.038
Then a Japanese guy probably
translated him to double-check on him.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.272
We don't need these instructions.
Not at all.

12:18.720 --> 12:19.994
Tear them up.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.308
You know the door to the house
is locked, right?

12:25.920 --> 12:27.717
Well, it's no problem.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.189
Huh?

12:31.120 --> 12:34.112
- You forgot the batteries?
- Yeah.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.716
I've got you here in the garage.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.276
The smell of gasoline, of fertilizer.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.038
What do you say, baby?

12:43.240 --> 12:46.710
I'll push you up on this washer
and turn you a few cycles.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.355
- I'll turn this washer on...
- Help! Oh, help!

12:50.600 --> 12:53.910
I'm locked in the garage
with a dirty old man!

12:54.360 --> 12:56.920
- Didn't we do this once 20 years ago?
- Yeah, I know.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.714
Dr. Corvin?

13:16.480 --> 13:17.469
Yes.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.349
Excuse me, sir,
am I interrupting something?

13:22.880 --> 13:25.633
- Yeah.
- Dr. Corvin, I'm Sara Holland...

13:25.840 --> 13:27.751
...and this is astronaut Ethan Glance.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.678
We're with NASA.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.834
It was in your car.
I heard someone scream.

13:34.680 --> 13:38.593
Thanks for saving the day.
Now what is it you want?

13:38.800 --> 13:40.438
Could we have
a minute of your time?

13:40.680 --> 13:43.956
You should've called ahead of time.
I'm a very busy man.

13:44.720 --> 13:48.759
Dr. Corvin, we're here because a
satellite with your guidance system...

13:48.960 --> 13:52.953
...is about to reenter the atmosphere.
The system is non-responsive.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.877
You want to take a crack at it?

13:58.520 --> 14:01.512
There seems to be an interruption
in the path here.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.519
But the circuitry still works.
It's sending us data.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.111
You're losing your uplink.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.953
There has to be a problem
in the manual routing drive.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.189
I don't think so.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.190
That's the consensus
among the engineers.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.789
Same engineers that sent you two here?

14:21.960 --> 14:23.552
Sorry, does that bother you?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.598
Yes, it does, actually.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.236
Your design predates
all existing guidance systems.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.956
It was ahead of its time in '69,
but this technology's obsolete now.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.760
None of the current engineers
even speak the language...

14:38.000 --> 14:40.560
...and the older guys are all...

14:41.000 --> 14:42.638
- ... are...
- Yeah.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.793
It wasn't designed for this
duration of duty, that's what.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.917
It was designed for the Skylab.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.589
My advice is to capture it
and bring it home.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.279
It's too big.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.309
For the space shuttle?
What kind of bird is it?

14:57.200 --> 15:01.398
It's a Russian
communications satellite.

15:01.920 --> 15:05.117
What the hell's my guidance system
doing on a Russian satellite?

15:05.320 --> 15:07.470
That's not our primary concern
at this time.

15:09.760 --> 15:13.673
Where's it orbiting? Or is that
not your primary concern either?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.757
1000 miles.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.189
Rate of decay?

15:18.480 --> 15:21.677
8000 meters per day and accelerating.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.310
It's coming home, all right.
Five weeks at the most, I got.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.792
NASA's calculations agree.
But here we are.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.032
Doctor, you designed this system.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.119
If anyone can solve this problem,
it's you.

15:42.080 --> 15:47.154
For a minute there, I thought
you two might be Bob Gerson's lackeys.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.554
But your knowledge...

15:48.800 --> 15:52.588
...and your knowledge of history
seems to make that impossible.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.238
Gerson's been taking credit
for my work since '58...

15:56.440 --> 15:59.716
...when he replaced my ass
with a monkey.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.155
You don't work for Gerson, do you?

16:06.440 --> 16:10.877
He's a project manager at NASA. He's
one of many assigned to this problem.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.677
I think it's time for you two
to head on out of here.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.350
- Dr. Corvin, your country needs you.
- Put a sock in it, sonny.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.190
Can't fix it from down here and
can't get a team up there in time.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.234
That satellite's dying. It'll
come back. My only hope is that...

16:28.480 --> 16:32.393
...whatever doesn't burn up in the
atmosphere lands on Gerson's house.

16:35.720 --> 16:40.396
I'll give you two career advice: Stay
away from Gerson, as far as possible.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.149
Apparently the buzz on you's correct.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.636
And what buzz is that?

16:49.160 --> 16:52.596
You're not a team player.
That's why you washed out at NASA.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.873
Get out.

17:00.840 --> 17:04.037
We have to brush up
on your hospitality skills.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.156
I think I have a solution
for your problem.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.198
Frank Corvin.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.676
So how long has it been, Frank?

18:04.280 --> 18:07.158
Probably not long enough, Bob.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.753
Still haven't lost
the Corvin charm, have we?

18:13.240 --> 18:15.151
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.198
- Sara?
- No, thanks.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.076
Miss Holland tells me you're
up to speed on our little problem.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.758
We've got one sick bird up there.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.997
Apparently, there's some kind of
design flaw in the guidance system.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.273
This is a hell of a way to get
the designer to help you out.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.316
Yeah?

18:37.040 --> 18:39.429
I heard all about your
initial response.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.911
But don't you worry none.
I'm sure we'll come up with something.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.312
Dr. Corvin is here with a solution.

18:47.680 --> 18:52.151
Well, praise the Lord and hallelujah.
We are delivered.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.348
So...

18:54.560 --> 18:56.790
...tell us about your solution, Frank.

18:59.280 --> 19:02.670
Send my team up. We'll fix
your broken satellite for you.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.710
- Damn good cup of coffee.
- Do you want to run that by me again?

19:10.920 --> 19:12.399
Team Daedalus.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.957
Jerry, Hawk, Tank. Send us up.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.993
- This is a joke. Am I right?
- It's no joke.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.631
We were the best of the best.
Even you'll admit to that.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.474
Uh-huh. How old are you, Frank?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.992
Old enough to know
your ass is in a sling.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.749
Sara,
would you excuse us for a minute?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.428
This is about to become
a personal matter.

19:44.200 --> 19:48.398
I know you're running out of options.
Otherwise you'd have never come to me.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.637
You sure as hell got that right.

19:51.280 --> 19:55.273
You've got a satellite that's gonna
come down in 34 days.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.038
Too big to retrieve...

19:57.240 --> 20:00.676
...and for some reason you don't want
it to crash in the atmosphere.

20:00.920 --> 20:05.038
I did the design system.
I'm the man to fix it for you.

20:05.360 --> 20:09.478
I don't know how to break this to you,
but you're an old man.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.073
Yeah?

20:13.400 --> 20:17.359
This old man's all you've got.
You know that and I know that.

20:17.600 --> 20:21.559
Hell, you sent up Glenn, didn't you?
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.872
You became a senior citizen
five years ago.

20:25.360 --> 20:26.429
Four.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.913
Hell, Frank. For once in your life,
try to be a team player.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.879
Train the crew if you want to.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.391
But let the professionals at NASA
fix that design flaw.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.595
There is no flaw.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.397
How it got on a Soviet satellite
during the Cold War is the only flaw.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.917
How did that happen, Bob?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.109
I don't know.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.950
This is a hands-on job and I don't
have time to train somebody...

20:57.160 --> 20:58.718
...to come up in time.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.997
So you'll just have to
send up Team Daedalus.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.911
- You can take it, or you can leave it.
- All right, all right.

21:07.480 --> 21:10.950
You as a technical advisor, maybe.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.279
But I can't fill up a space shuttle
with geriatrics.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.755
You should be professional enough
to know that!

21:19.320 --> 21:22.118
Hell, half those boys
are probably dead anyway.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.473
Clock's ticking, Bob.
And I'm only getting older.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.956
Okay. You got it.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.550
Sir? Sir? Sir!

21:35.760 --> 21:38.149
Mr. Gerson would like you
to wait right here.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.792
Okay, it's a deal.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.159
I want it in writing.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.559
Okay.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.592
Now hear my terms.

21:55.800 --> 22:00.476
You and your entire crew'll have to
meet the physical requirements.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.639
You'll all train to fix that guidance
system side by side with my people...

22:05.120 --> 22:07.190
...in case one of your boys
doesn't pass.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.476
- I think that's fair.
- You're damn straight it is.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.835
I'll enjoy watching you make
a complete ass of yourself.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.757
It's gonna be a real pleasure
working with you again.

22:31.480 --> 22:32.708
Romans...

22:33.000 --> 22:36.072
...Chronicles. Chronicles. Ah, yes.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.197
In the 40th year,
Amariah begat Zadok...

22:40.400 --> 22:42.038
...who begat Libni...

22:42.240 --> 22:44.117
...the brother of Uzziah.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.671
No, that's not it, either.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.108
Just...

22:49.000 --> 22:49.955
No...

23:10.160 --> 23:14.790
Once upon a time, four of the best
pilots in the U.S. Air Force...

23:15.000 --> 23:17.309
...trained to fly into space.

23:17.880 --> 23:22.476
They flew at the speed of sound
to the very top of the sky...

23:23.040 --> 23:26.828
...cheating death and free-falling
from 20 miles high.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.399
Nice to see you, young man.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.039
- And you, sir.
- Reverend.

23:38.240 --> 23:41.073
It's nice to have
you young people here.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.271
Hey, boss.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.271
Excuse me, my former boss.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.917
I bring glad tidings, Reverend Tank,
in the name of Team Daedalus.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.759
It seems there might be
resurrection after all.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.110
Come in and let's talk about it.

23:59.880 --> 24:03.190
I don't know, Frank.
That's a very complicated proposition.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.313
- I have a flock and grandchildren.
- They'll be here when you get back.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.473
This'll give you material
for three or four more sermons.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.992
- I'll need to pray about this.
- Could it be a quick prayer?

24:14.600 --> 24:17.558
Just wait a moment,
my stiff-necked brother.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.557
I'm receiving a word from on high.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.833
And what is that word?

24:24.400 --> 24:27.836
The word is, why the hell not?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.159
There you go.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.075
Good.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.870
Second one's too fast.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.038
Some little Johnny
will pass out on us there.

25:00.920 --> 25:05.072
35 years of designing
supersonic aircraft for the military.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.756
Now he's building roller coasters.
That's perfect.

25:09.120 --> 25:13.193
- Your father's a gifted man.
- He's gifted, all right.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.559
Too flat.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.674
Oh, boy. We have some work to do.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.639
Hey, sweetheart.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.031
- You did good.
- They didn't do what I-

25:42.160 --> 25:43.639
Hey, Frank.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.798
Holy cow. What are you doing here?

25:47.360 --> 25:50.670
Finding out what you're doing
for the next month and a half.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.152
NASA wants to send us into space.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.554
I wondered which one of us
was gonna go first.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.029
Senile dementia.

26:00.240 --> 26:04.631
40-year-old memories are sharp
but you can't remember your breakfast.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.673
Frank Corvin, my associate, Cherie.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.393
- Cherie.
- Hi.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.113
What'd you have for breakfast?

26:11.960 --> 26:15.236
I had vegetarian huevos rancheros,
egg whites only, of course...

26:15.440 --> 26:18.238
...and then some sort of
a filtered decaf cappuccino...

26:18.440 --> 26:20.829
...that was filtered
through a jockstrap.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.438
- What are you talking about? NASA-
- Right here.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.910
Right here. Here's our contract.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.679
You don't need those, do you?

26:35.720 --> 26:39.679
No. Just to read. And go to movies,
drive, walk. You know.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.110
- Holy cow. How on earth-
- Are you in?

26:42.560 --> 26:44.391
Am I in? Hell, yeah.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.433
I can't believe it. Team Daedalus.
We ride again.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.995
Hawk must've gone into orbit
when you told him.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.309
I haven't talked to Hawk yet.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.909
I haven't talked to Hawk
in a long time, Jerry.

26:56.920 --> 27:01.630
When are the two of you gonna grow up
and stop acting like little boys?

27:07.840 --> 27:11.549
It's my birthday and I want
the shit scared out of me.

27:11.800 --> 27:15.998
I want to do barrel rolls and loop-the-
loops. All that kind of stuff.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.954
We don't do that kind of flying.
It's dangerous and irresponsible.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.674
- Yeah, too many lawsuits.
- Well, who does?

27:22.960 --> 27:24.075
He does.

27:31.720 --> 27:32.709
Sweet.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.789
Hey, Hawk.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.117
- This guy wants a scary ride.
- It's my birthday.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.199
Happy birthday.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.159
Oh, we're upside-down! Oh, yeah!

28:06.920 --> 28:10.117
Here comes the fun part.
We're going weightless.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.233
I don't think that
that's such a good idea!

28:19.960 --> 28:21.871
You're crazy!

29:01.080 --> 29:02.274
I'm so sorry.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.153
Where'd you get the bright idea
to eat a big lunch...

29:05.360 --> 29:07.749
...before you come out here
and went flying?

29:08.000 --> 29:11.595
- I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.
- That's all right. I'll get it.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.712
Congratulations!

29:16.920 --> 29:20.276
You earned your wings today,
young man. My hat's off to you!

29:20.480 --> 29:22.994
Well done! Yes, sir.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.668
- Splendid work.
- Thank you.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.108
I surrender to you.

29:34.280 --> 29:37.955
- I love you and being on the ground.
- What's that smell?

29:41.840 --> 29:43.671
Hey.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.792
Hey.

29:46.480 --> 29:49.040
- You know the worst day of my life?
- No.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.315
The day Armstrong
set foot on the moon.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.438
I was the only one that wanted
to commit suicide that day.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.989
Thanks. We haven't talked
in 12 years...

29:58.200 --> 30:00.668
...and that's been
the big question on my mind:

30:00.880 --> 30:02.916
What could make you commit suicide?

30:04.160 --> 30:05.593
What are you doing here?

30:06.320 --> 30:08.629
Filling a promise I made 40 years ago.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.037
Was that the promise to kill me...

30:11.240 --> 30:13.595
...or the one
to have both of my legs broke?

30:13.800 --> 30:15.631
It was the other one.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.914
I'm working on a little blackmail
with NASA.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.793
They've got a satellite that'll crash
unless we fix it.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.560
I'm guessing you designed
that guidance system.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.991
Yeah. They're desperate.
Even Gerson's in on the deal.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.112
I said I'd do it if the original
Team Daedalus did the job.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.155
Here it is, all in black and white.

30:38.960 --> 30:42.475
Jerry and Tank are in and waiting
for us across the highway.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.513
Old age just brings out
more of the Frank in you.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.631
I'm genuinely impressed.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.469
But you don't need to put foolish
notions in the head of a fool.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.350
Especially not a damned old fool.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.033
You have a nice flight.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.829
You weren't one then,
but you are one now.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.031
Say hello to Barbara for me.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.389
Yeah, you say hello to Jackie.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.353
I wished I could.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.239
Jackie died on me, Frank.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.038
Sorry. I didn't know that.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.035
- He said no, huh?
- He's not coming.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.639
Maybe we should talk to him.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.838
He's the same stubborn jackass
he always was.

32:09.280 --> 32:13.273
And you still drive slower than a
little old lady on her way to church.

32:41.360 --> 32:45.911
That's enough to send the
astronaut miles and miles in space.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.915
So, what if I was to jump
on a trampoline in space?

32:50.120 --> 32:52.839
You would go up and up and up...

32:53.040 --> 32:55.554
...and you'd never come down!

32:56.720 --> 32:58.870
Could you hit a baseball to the moon?

32:59.080 --> 33:01.913
Actually, you could.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.230
You'd just have to knock it
halfway there.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.908
That's just about 100,000 miles.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.873
And then the moon's gravity
does the rest.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.998
- Okay? Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.869
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, Mrs. Holland.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.836
I've never met a kid who didn't dream
of being an astronaut.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.910
Ever meet a kid
that wouldn't grow up?

33:23.120 --> 33:27.875
Sara Holland this is William Hawkins,
retired Air Force colonel.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.469
The best pilot they ever had,
next to me.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.516
The Hawk. I've heard of you.

33:33.760 --> 33:37.070
Commander Jenkins told me a story
about you and him in Vietnam.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.113
From Cliff Jenkins,
it's guaranteed to be 100% bullshit.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.959
I'll guarantee you that.
How's he doing?

33:43.560 --> 33:44.913
Actually, he's dead.

33:46.160 --> 33:50.790
While Hawk gets his foot out of his
mouth, I'll introduce Tank Sullivan.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.798
He's a navigator.
The best one the Air Force ever had.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.992
He'd find anything anywhere.
That is, till God found him.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.754
Now more than ever.
A pleasure to meet you.

33:59.960 --> 34:03.032
This is Jerry O'Neill. He's
a structural engineer and designer.

34:03.240 --> 34:06.232
Jerry worked on the Stealth project.
You remember that.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.833
No nickname for you?

34:08.040 --> 34:09.632
Well, you can call me...

34:09.960 --> 34:10.949
...anytime.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.349
Okay.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.594
If you men are ready,
we have some work to do.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.995
Would you like a banana, honey?

34:25.440 --> 34:29.478
I don't need to remind you of
the consequences of failure here.

34:29.719 --> 34:33.349
- Personal consequences.
- That's the problem with you Russians.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.239
With you,
the glass is always half empty.

34:40.639 --> 34:43.996
These men you are sending up,
they're not astronauts.

34:45.440 --> 34:49.353
The last time they trained for a space
mission, cars had fins on them.

34:51.199 --> 34:54.158
The truth is, Frank Corvin's
not going anywhere.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.748
His team's not gonna pass
the physical trials.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.715
This is supposed to reassure me?

35:03.600 --> 35:04.749
What will you do then?

35:06.480 --> 35:09.916
My best young astronaut
is training alongside Corvin...

35:10.120 --> 35:13.715
...gaining proficiency
in that antiquated guidance system.

35:13.920 --> 35:17.196
Until he does, Frank Corvin's
gonna believe he's going up.

35:21.760 --> 35:22.749
I don't know.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.472
- We should consult-
- There will be no goddamn consulting.

35:28.600 --> 35:32.195
No one, and I mean no one,
is to be in the loop...

35:32.640 --> 35:34.039
...on our little problem.

35:35.080 --> 35:37.719
Do I make myself perfectly clear,
general?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.075
Good morning, all.

35:44.280 --> 35:48.193
And welcome to STS-200 ops
overview briefing.

35:48.400 --> 35:51.198
This is an unusual mission,
I think we'd all agree.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.119
We'll get started
on the particulars here in a moment.

35:54.320 --> 35:58.313
First, let's welcome the astronauts
selected for this mission:

35:58.560 --> 36:01.552
The founding members
of Project Daedalus.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.596
As you all know, these men
are the pioneers of this business.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.030
They were around
when rockets were born.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.269
Welcome, gentlemen.

36:18.320 --> 36:22.279
STS-200 was originally slated
to deliver a structural payload...

36:22.480 --> 36:24.675
...to the International Space Station.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.998
Circumstances have forced us to push
back that mission and undertake...

36:29.200 --> 36:30.918
...an emergency rescue operation.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.954
The average staging time for
a mission is 12 months.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.072
We're doing this one in 30 days.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.152
In 1986...

36:42.360 --> 36:47.036
...the former Soviet Union launched
communications satellite Ikon.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.549
- Ikon is a link...
- I'll tell you about it later.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.990
...in Russia's
telecommunications chain.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.675
Her orbit is rapidly decaying.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.236
She will reenter
the Earth's atmosphere in 30 days.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.199
Your mission
is to intercept and capture her...

37:01.400 --> 37:03.436
...using the shuttle's grappling arm.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.790
You will then have a 42-hour window...

37:06.000 --> 37:08.833
...in which to repair
her guidance system.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.873
From there she'll be reconfigured
by Mission Control.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.992
After that, you'll shoot
her back into geosync orbit...

37:15.200 --> 37:18.317
...using the payload assist
module rockets.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.119
Any questions?

37:23.600 --> 37:24.715
Question.

37:25.680 --> 37:29.719
With all due respect to the guys,
why don't we just capture the bird...

37:29.920 --> 37:33.117
...bring it home with a crew
trained in satellite retrieval?

37:33.640 --> 37:35.198
It's too big, Gene.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.829
Too big?

37:39.520 --> 37:40.669
For the space shuttle?

37:45.720 --> 37:48.314
How did you guys get it up there
in the first place?

37:49.080 --> 37:52.311
There were modifications
post-deployment.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.753
Listen up, people.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.995
This system has to be fixed on-site.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.838
Frank is the only engineer...

38:01.040 --> 38:03.952
...proficient in
such obsolete technology.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.190
Given the short amount of time...

38:08.400 --> 38:10.630
...he's the only engineer
to do the job.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.713
So Frank Corvin's band of...

38:17.360 --> 38:19.954
...Leisure World aviators
are going into space.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.720
NASA agree to all this?
Did the Russians?

38:22.920 --> 38:26.117
- Frank didn't give us a lot of choice.
- I figured that.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.710
You hate each other way too much
to have cooked this up together.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.429
Count me out.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.798
I think you guys
need to get a new flight director.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.598
You know, one thing
is driving me nuts, though.

38:40.800 --> 38:45.351
How did a guidance system from Skylab
end up in a Russian bird?

38:46.480 --> 38:50.758
I don't know, Gene, but apparently
I'm the man who can fix it.

38:50.960 --> 38:55.829
Grow up, will you, Frank?
Can't you be a team player for once?

38:56.080 --> 38:59.231
Why can't you assist my astronauts
as an engineer?

38:59.440 --> 39:03.797
If I wasn't 100% sure that my guys
could do as well as your astronauts...

39:04.000 --> 39:06.639
- ... I wouldn't go anywhere near it.
- Yeah, sure.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.632
Still the same old Frank, huh?

39:09.400 --> 39:11.789
Well, that's the consensus
around here.

39:13.760 --> 39:18.072
So you fellas made a deal?
Fine. Here's my deal.

39:18.680 --> 39:22.355
I am the flight director and
I can pull the plug on this one.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.959
When it's over, it's over.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.754
I am not turning over
a new space shuttle...

39:27.040 --> 39:30.828
...to rookies with a month's training.
You're taking two of my guys.

39:31.560 --> 39:36.236
Ethan, who's a brown-nosing snot
and Roger, who's a cocky little shit.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.795
But they're the two best astronauts.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.798
They fly or the package
stays on the ground.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.877
- Deal?
- Well, okay, Gene.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.236
And if I sense for one second...

39:48.440 --> 39:51.591
...that your team isn't cutting it
physically or mentally...

39:51.800 --> 39:54.633
...you're off,
and my original team flies.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.035
So let's see if you still
got it to go.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.435
Suck it up, Frank.

40:04.560 --> 40:08.394
- Gene's the same guy I remembered.
- Yeah, he's an asshole.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.312
- A prick.
- Some things never change.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.758
Now just cough when I say, okay?

40:14.160 --> 40:15.275
Cough.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.073
And again, please.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.189
Morning, gentlemen.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.628
I'm Dr. Caruthers.
I'll be assisting Dr. Michaelson here.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.229
Hi.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.671
Nothing to be ashamed of.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.399
Easy for you to say.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.638
- Cover your eye and read the chart.
- Time me.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.677
"E, F, L, E, P, T...

40:41.880 --> 40:43.438
...P, L, E, P, F, L, F, L, E...

40:43.680 --> 40:45.352
...P, T, P, L, F, E, T, E...

40:45.560 --> 40:48.836
...L, O, P, Z, D, D, E,
F, P, O, T, E, C...

40:49.200 --> 40:51.714
...F, L, E, P, T, P, L, E, P...

40:51.920 --> 40:55.913
...F, L, F, L, E, P, T, P, L,
F, L, T, M, A, D...

40:56.120 --> 40:56.996
...in U, S, A."

40:57.200 --> 41:01.113
Made in the USA.
That's one for the economy, I guess.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.839
You have 20/10 vision.

41:03.040 --> 41:05.998
- I'll be damned.
- And 14 seconds.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.152
All right. "E, F, L, E, P, T...

41:10.360 --> 41:12.191
...P, L, E, P, F, L, E...

41:12.400 --> 41:17.155
...L, E, P, T, L, P, E, F,
E, T, Z, E, T...

41:20.120 --> 41:21.030
...T."

41:21.240 --> 41:23.959
-20/20.
- And five seconds slow.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.235
Good.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.035
- Next.
- I'm next.

41:27.600 --> 41:31.275
- Five seconds, my ass.
- I wish I could be your next.

41:31.880 --> 41:35.873
Get your fiance to take you to a
French brasserie and give you oysters.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.436
- If he won't, can I?
- Let's see how you do on your physical.

41:39.680 --> 41:42.638
I'll just do the bottom three lines.
" F, L, E, P, T, P...

41:42.840 --> 41:45.195
...L, E, P, F, L, F,
L, E, P, T, P, L, F, E, T."

41:45.400 --> 41:48.597
Do you think oysters would be
too much for the first date?

41:49.240 --> 41:53.552
- You have 20/10 vision, captain.
- These are just for looking at you.

41:55.320 --> 41:58.153
I may be blind, Frank,
but my memory's perfect.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.794
Next.

42:05.640 --> 42:06.914
Colonel Hawkins.

42:09.600 --> 42:10.555
You all right?

42:10.760 --> 42:14.673
- I'm just not too crazy about needles.
- Well, that's pretty common.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.754
Make a fist
and pump it a couple times.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.559
Okay, that's good.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.631
- You don't remember me, do you?
- What?

42:24.840 --> 42:27.479
My father was flight surgeon
at Beale Air Force Base.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.039
Oh, yeah.

42:29.800 --> 42:33.156
- Dr. Martin. The Goat.
- The Goat, yeah. That was my dad.

42:33.360 --> 42:36.272
I met you when I was 12 years old.
I doubt you remember.

42:36.480 --> 42:38.118
Now wait a minute now.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.754
Pigtails, freckles
and knobby little knees.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.473
- Was that you?
- That was me.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.073
- How is old Goat?
- He passed away nine years ago.

42:52.760 --> 42:55.638
You noticed how everybody
seems to be dead lately?

42:55.880 --> 42:57.393
- Yeah.
- I hear that.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.357
You guys ready to do some laps?

43:02.080 --> 43:03.149
Sure.

43:03.360 --> 43:06.079
- We'll go easy today. We'll do 10.
- Minutes?

43:06.280 --> 43:08.396
Miles. Let's go.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.868
Miles.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.911
- Little prick.
- Frank.

43:13.280 --> 43:14.679
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.189
Did he really mean miles?

43:28.280 --> 43:30.874
- How far have we gone, Frank?
- Almost two.

43:31.080 --> 43:34.993
- I'm going to have a heart attack.
- That's the point.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.668
- What? To give us heart attacks?
- Hell, yes.

43:37.880 --> 43:39.632
Suppose we didn't make liftoff.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.877
We'd be the first country
to launch dead bodies into orbit.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.718
If we have heart attacks...

43:44.920 --> 43:47.434
...NASA will want us
to have it here on Earth.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.274
- Get moving.
- I'm an engineer, for crying out loud.

43:50.480 --> 43:54.632
- I stopped running during Nixon.
- Your lady doctor's watching.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.068
- She is?
- Oh, no.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.878
Do 225, colonel?

44:10.240 --> 44:13.789
Oh, hell, yes.
Hell, yes. Spot me, tiger.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.115
You got it.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.437
- Ready? There we go.
- Yeah.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.314
All right, let it go.
Let her go, Hawk.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.391
Come on, you can do it. Thattaboy.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.278
Thattaboy.

44:26.480 --> 44:30.871
All right. Push, baby.
Push, push. Up.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.469
All right, come on. Here we go.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.035
Let her go.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.593
Let her go. Push it, baby.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.157
Come on. Yeah, you got it.

44:39.360 --> 44:42.318
You the man. All right.
I got it. I got it.

44:42.800 --> 44:43.949
All right now!

44:44.160 --> 44:46.549
- Thattaboy.
- Oh, yes, sir.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.079
Not bad.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.711
You trying to do something
over there.

44:52.920 --> 44:55.275
Anything worth doing's
worth doing well.

44:56.880 --> 44:59.269
I'm going to go
to my room now and cry.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.396
I'm too tired to chew.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.280
Try to look a little perkier,
will you, fellas?

45:21.360 --> 45:23.954
You still want to go on with this,
Frank?

45:24.800 --> 45:28.793
What do you want to do, quit now?
We just finished the tough stuff.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.911
Now we start training for the mission.

45:31.120 --> 45:35.432
- Everybody get a good night's sleep.
- There's a real challenge.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.474
What are you doing?

45:39.560 --> 45:41.232
What are you doing?

45:42.280 --> 45:43.713
Goddamn...

45:44.200 --> 45:46.156
...teeth won't stay in.

45:47.720 --> 45:49.073
Damn, Jerry.

45:49.840 --> 45:51.319
Jesus.

45:52.320 --> 45:56.074
Gentlemen, a round of drinks
from your friends over there...

45:56.280 --> 46:00.068
...who ordered you some goodies.
A little Ensure for you guys.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.710
To old gummers in space.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.955
Cheers.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.631
I drink this stuff.

46:14.320 --> 46:16.231
It's good for your libido.

46:21.920 --> 46:24.036
- Race you the last lap.
- All right.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.276
- Okay. Countdown to one?
- All right.

46:26.480 --> 46:27.629
One!

46:51.160 --> 46:54.470
Frank, hi. I was looking for Hawk.

46:55.320 --> 46:57.356
Well, come on in. Come on in.

46:58.560 --> 47:01.472
He's right in there. Go ahead.
The coast is all clear.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.278
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

47:11.320 --> 47:13.038
I am so sorry.

47:13.280 --> 47:16.431
No, it's okay. It's okay.
It's all right.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.715
What brings you to
the men's locker room?

47:21.920 --> 47:25.833
Gene moved up the stimulator, I mean,
I'm sorry, the simulator run.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.834
Okay. To when?

47:31.440 --> 47:33.556
Oh, right. That would be...

47:33.800 --> 47:35.597
...11:00.

47:35.800 --> 47:39.839
There were some procedures
that I wanted you to be aware of.

47:42.160 --> 47:44.958
This is very uncomfortable,
and I'll be leaving now.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.593
Sara.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.390
I'm going to take you out for a beer.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.272
I'll be needing one.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.598
Here we go.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.991
Right on target.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.836
Hi. Jerry O'Neill.

48:04.440 --> 48:06.829
Do you mind, lady?
You make me nervous.

48:07.040 --> 48:10.715
Get used to it. You'll have a lot
more people watching you on TV.

48:10.920 --> 48:13.354
Thank you. Very comforting.

48:13.760 --> 48:16.558
- You don't make me nervous.
- Oh, Jerry.

48:18.840 --> 48:22.549
I got a roller coaster that'll stop
your heart. I threw up on my helmet!

48:22.760 --> 48:25.957
That was three Gs. As bad as it gets
during ascent and reentry.

48:26.160 --> 48:29.232
I am so pleased.
It was a piece of cake, guys.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.396
Okay, thanks.

48:41.560 --> 48:44.757
- First one to pass out buys the beer.
- You're on.

48:55.160 --> 48:56.639
This thing moving?

48:57.920 --> 49:00.480
I don't know.
Doesn't seem to be moving to me.

49:04.200 --> 49:06.714
Say, fellas, is y'all's
equipment broke down?

49:14.000 --> 49:15.228
What's going on?

49:24.600 --> 49:26.431
Makes them look younger, doesn't it?

49:26.680 --> 49:30.559
- You're a pushover.
- I do believe it's moving now.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.751
That sure will take the wrinkles out.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.992
What the hell's going on here!?

49:48.120 --> 49:52.750
I'm sure you think you're putting on
a great show, but this is not a toy!

49:55.640 --> 49:58.473
Now which one of you idiots
wants to explain this?

49:59.120 --> 49:59.950
Gene.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.155
What?

50:04.040 --> 50:06.270
Which one of us passed out first?

50:08.760 --> 50:10.990
I'm getting too old for this shit.

50:34.360 --> 50:38.592
I can cook things you wouldn't
believe. I cook crab, lobster.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.551
That'll be $7.00.

50:54.120 --> 50:55.599
Hello?

50:58.560 --> 51:00.596
I'm sorry. He's buying.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.633
- We both passed out at the same time.
- Bullshit.

51:03.840 --> 51:07.150
I saw you pass out just before
I passed out. I saw that.

51:07.400 --> 51:10.836
But never mind. I'll get this round
because of my confidence.

51:11.040 --> 51:14.749
Absolute confidence in my superiority,
absolute superiority to you...

51:14.960 --> 51:17.872
...in every human endeavor in life.
Keep the change.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.275
We'll leave it up to the young lady.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.870
Tell me, given the circumstances
which one of us...

51:24.080 --> 51:27.311
- ... would you take home tonight?
- You mean, like, to the home?

51:27.560 --> 51:30.438
- Yeah.
- Like, the retirement home?

51:30.680 --> 51:32.591
Seriously.
Would you choose this man...

51:32.800 --> 51:35.678
...with his asymmetrical
sagging ass cheeks...

51:35.880 --> 51:37.950
...love handles
the size of Nebraska...

51:38.160 --> 51:40.913
...and his gross, old,
ugly ingrown toenails?

51:41.120 --> 51:44.396
Or this hairy-eared son of a bitch
with a chicken gizzard neck...

51:44.640 --> 51:47.279
...and a face like
Death Valley fire trails?

51:47.480 --> 51:50.995
- Stop harassing the waitress.
- I'm not. What are you talking about?

51:51.200 --> 51:54.317
I'm having a private conversation
that doesn't involve you.

51:54.560 --> 51:58.269
Go back to your virgin pink daiquiri
and mind your own business.

51:58.480 --> 52:01.517
She's my friend, who has to put up
with assholes like you.

52:01.720 --> 52:03.073
- Tiny-
- But I don't.

52:03.280 --> 52:04.952
If you want to harass, harass me.

52:05.560 --> 52:09.235
- I believe he's harassing you already.
- I'll put you in the hospital.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.635
I have Medicare.
Shoot your best shot.

52:11.840 --> 52:14.274
- I'll make your old lady a widow.
- Don't-

52:14.480 --> 52:18.553
Wait! You can't do this! No,
you're going up into space in 22 days.

52:18.760 --> 52:21.149
If you break a bone
or sprain your ankle...

52:21.360 --> 52:24.989
...your space shuttle seat'll go to
that MIT weenie with blow-dried hair.

52:25.200 --> 52:27.760
We'll watch the launch on TV
at your damn house.

52:27.960 --> 52:31.509
- What makes you think I'll hurt myself?
- What about a space shuttle?

52:31.720 --> 52:35.269
You're gonna blow this for us again.
You and your mean-ass temper.

52:35.480 --> 52:39.598
- Are you saying I blew it back in '58?
- Hell, yes, you blew it in '58.

52:39.800 --> 52:42.314
You crashed every plane
the Air Force gave us.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.471
All right. We're taking this outside.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.757
I'll whip your ass!
Get out there in that parking lot!

52:48.960 --> 52:50.439
You wait here, Tiny.

52:50.960 --> 52:54.191
- Let's go.
- I got 10 on Frank.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.356
Can I get your ass
out of a jam or not?

53:02.640 --> 53:05.200
Did you see that guy's face
when I said-

53:06.840 --> 53:10.310
Just who got Team Daedalus canned,
Colonel Hawkins?

53:10.560 --> 53:12.710
Damn, this is gonna be a long night.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.310
- Hawk's quick, but Frank's got reach.
- They'll never grow up.

53:23.640 --> 53:27.076
That girl I was dancing with
was a database administrator.

53:27.280 --> 53:28.395
Really?

53:29.720 --> 53:30.869
- Morning.
- Hey Gene.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.352
- Morning, Hawk.
- Good morning.

53:33.560 --> 53:36.074
- What happened to your eye?
- I fell in the shower.

53:36.280 --> 53:40.876
Tell maintenance to put some no-slip
adhesives on that slippery floor.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.911
How's that right there?

53:48.800 --> 53:51.758
Still 10 megahertz,
maybe a little more.

53:53.320 --> 53:54.435
How's it going, Frank?

53:55.920 --> 53:57.638
Fine. Fine.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.349
What's with the eye?

54:01.520 --> 54:02.669
Slip in the shower?

54:03.880 --> 54:05.598
How would you know that?

54:07.440 --> 54:09.032
I'll chat with the janitor.

54:17.680 --> 54:18.669
Airspeed, 300.

54:19.720 --> 54:21.551
Crosswind on our right, 14 knots.

54:23.640 --> 54:26.313
Running a little hot.
Want to open up a speed brake?

54:28.400 --> 54:29.719
200.

54:31.760 --> 54:32.909
100.

54:35.480 --> 54:36.913
Touchdown.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.677
Nice landing, guys.

54:41.920 --> 54:44.718
Let's put the rookies up front.
Simsupe, you on with me?

54:44.920 --> 54:46.194
Simsupe. Go, Gene.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.874
- It's gonna be tough to beat.
- I think so.

54:50.560 --> 54:51.834
You up.

54:52.400 --> 54:54.550
Standard package.

54:54.760 --> 54:57.593
Let's throw them a Little League
kind of curve.

54:58.320 --> 55:00.595
Hydraulic failure.
Switching to secondary.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.153
I'm going to manual control.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.557
You can't do that.
The bird's on a computerized track.

55:07.360 --> 55:11.319
1000 feet. Your airspeed's too high.
Stick to their protocol, will you?

55:11.560 --> 55:13.676
I'm going to manual control.
Goddamn, boy.

55:13.880 --> 55:15.791
You cannot do that!

55:16.120 --> 55:17.951
Secondary hydraulic failure.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.196
- You'll come in short.
- Like hell.

55:26.200 --> 55:27.315
Shit.

55:28.840 --> 55:31.638
Come on. You can't throw that
at them on the first run.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.752
We got three weeks to send
four old farts into space.

55:34.960 --> 55:37.190
This is flight school 101 stuff.

55:38.640 --> 55:43.270
Look, this is not a stripped-down show
plane. You gotta do it their way.

55:43.560 --> 55:46.438
I don't need a computer
to tell me how to land a plane.

55:46.680 --> 55:49.035
It's not a plane.
It's a flying brick on approach.

55:49.240 --> 55:52.312
- You got to use the onboard computer.
- What if it fails?

55:52.840 --> 55:54.159
It's never failed.

55:55.040 --> 55:56.075
Houston, Horizon.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.709
Go, Horizon.

55:58.240 --> 56:01.630
Request secondary landing, please.
Houston, Horizon.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.559
Request onboard computer failure...

56:04.760 --> 56:06.830
...on second landing.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.879
All right, run it again.

56:09.560 --> 56:12.677
- Horizon, stand by for 2nd approach.
- Sock it to them.

56:13.560 --> 56:15.232
3000 feet. Coming in too steep.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.957
Pull up, sir. You'll lose it again.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.594
Fire in Av Bay Two.
You'll lose avionics.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.913
I don't need them anyway, this thing's
a flying brick on approach.

56:25.600 --> 56:28.194
Wind shear off the nose
and the fire is contained.

56:28.400 --> 56:30.277
Computers are down. She's all yours.

56:30.480 --> 56:32.311
500 feet. You're almost lined up.

56:32.720 --> 56:34.551
Your airspeed is way too high.

56:34.760 --> 56:37.877
Airspeed is four-niner-zero.
Coming in too high.

56:38.080 --> 56:40.389
- You'll overshoot.
- You won't get it stopped.

56:40.640 --> 56:44.189
It's easy. All you got to do is
tap on the brakes a little bit.

56:50.800 --> 56:53.030
Not that much.
You'll put her into a stall.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.395
100 feet.
You know what you're doing, right?

56:57.640 --> 57:00.916
- I'm tapping on the brakes a bit.
- Drop the nose! You'll lose it.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.109
Knock it off!

57:02.320 --> 57:03.355
Drop the nose.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.194
- What's the airspeed?
-200. You're right on it.

57:06.400 --> 57:10.188
What do you say we just
drop that nose a little bit...

57:10.400 --> 57:11.833
...like that right there.

57:17.080 --> 57:18.911
Smooth as a baby's ass.

57:20.600 --> 57:21.919
That's impossible.

57:22.360 --> 57:24.590
For a computer it might be.

57:25.840 --> 57:28.559
Flying brick. I like that.

57:36.480 --> 57:40.758
Ladies and gentlemen, from your
teammates at the table over there.

57:41.920 --> 57:43.353
Gerber's baby food.

57:43.600 --> 57:46.751
And some training material
for you to look over.

57:46.960 --> 57:49.110
Pictures for the bigger words.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.592
A talking frog's worth something.

57:57.120 --> 57:59.475
-40 percent.
-40 percent?!

57:59.720 --> 58:01.915
You might nail it.
You might crash and burn.

58:02.120 --> 58:04.839
- The odds are against you, colonel.
- Watch this.

58:08.840 --> 58:09.909
40 percent.

58:10.120 --> 58:12.350
40 percent for you, you nail it.

58:12.600 --> 58:15.068
40 percent for me,
I'd have missed by a mile.

58:15.280 --> 58:17.840
That's why I got out of
the astronaut program.

58:18.160 --> 58:22.233
I knew my chances of getting on
a space shuttle were way less than 40.

58:22.440 --> 58:24.908
But I was an astronaut, almost.

58:25.120 --> 58:28.271
- You'd have been a damn good one too.
- Thank you.

58:29.720 --> 58:33.872
You don't think like that. You've
jumped out of planes 20 miles up.

58:34.080 --> 58:37.038
You drove rocket sleds
at the speed of sound.

58:37.800 --> 58:40.872
- You're not afraid of anything.
- I've been afraid.

58:41.080 --> 58:43.310
Oh, bullshit. When?

58:46.480 --> 58:48.596
When I was 17 years old.

58:50.880 --> 58:54.156
I was crazy in love
with this college girl.

58:54.680 --> 58:57.319
She was beautiful. Oh, gorgeous.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.118
And a ball of fire.

58:59.400 --> 59:01.470
She, of course,
was crazy in love with-

59:01.720 --> 59:02.914
- You.
- No.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.680
Texas A&M's all-American defensive end
Scott LeBeau.

59:05.880 --> 59:09.395
And I mean, this cat
was six-foot-six if he was a foot.

59:10.240 --> 59:11.992
Gary Cooper handsome.

59:13.040 --> 59:16.874
One day, a bunch of friends and I
decided we'd drink too much beer...

59:17.080 --> 59:19.753
...and crash a big old
sorority cotillion.

59:19.960 --> 59:23.873
You know, everybody's dressed up
in chiffon gowns and Daddy's tuxedo.

59:24.080 --> 59:28.437
There we are, looking like a bunch
of brush poppers and goat ropers.

59:28.760 --> 59:33.151
- At the governor's ranch too.
- I'm beginning to get the picture.

59:33.360 --> 59:37.672
So my friends tell me that they see
LeBeau entering the Port-a-Potty.

59:37.880 --> 59:40.314
One of them little old
fiberglass shithouses.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.233
I did a better tackle on that
fiberglass shithouse...

59:43.440 --> 59:45.954
...than he ever did
on the football field...

59:46.160 --> 59:48.628
...and the thing rolled
down a bluff into a creek.

59:48.840 --> 59:51.195
Screaming and yelling
all the way down...

59:51.440 --> 59:55.069
...except it don't sound like no
all-American defensive end.

59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.035
- It's decidedly more feminine.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.392
The love of my life, rolling down
the bluff in a fiberglass shithouse.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.875
It was very, very sad.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.430
- What happened then?
- I ran like hell.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.189
- Joined the Air Force the next day.
- Afraid LeBeau'd kick your ass.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.868
Well, hell, no.
I wasn't afraid of him.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.310
I was afraid, I mean...

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.829
...truly afraid of her.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.958
Are you afraid of me?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.558
I married her.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.199
Four years later.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.230
What? I'm only 15 minutes late.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.308
Oh, shit.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.839
Extra, extra. Read all about it.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.429
I don't know how this leaked out.
I swear.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:30.116
NASA's been getting calls from
every tabloid in the country...

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.436
...asking me to verify that story.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.237
Why can't we verify the story?

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.472
- Why?
- Yeah.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.036
Because STS-200 is a delicate,
top-secret satellite recovery...

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.719
...that's why.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.554
That makes it look like
a goddamn three-ring circus.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.878
How do you think the vice president
felt this morning...

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.275
...when he opened his paper
and saw that?

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.036
It's easy for you to laugh.
You don't deal with him. I do.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.118
We're going to simulate your
onboard living conditions...

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.437
...to familiarize you with
the new living environment.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.868
Watch your step.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.236
- What the hell's this thing?
- ACM.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.632
Asshole Centering Monitor.
Gentlemen, this is your funnel.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.434
It attaches to the hose here.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.673
Before starting, make sure you have
a tight seal against your skin.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.077
- Is that the only one you got?
- Yes, one size does fit all.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.239
But just in case, there's a diaper
underneath your pressurized suits.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.273
- I'll use that.
- I'm sure you will.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.434
Anything else?

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.477
You're having a bit of an acid thing.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.193
- No, no, no.
- It's a flashback.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.152
No, no. Seriously.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.875
Avionics on this thing, some of them
are quite old. B-52-type stuff.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.157
My next guests are
the most famous men in America.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.555
USA Today calls them
"The Ripe Stuff."

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.149
Please welcome Team Daedalus.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.714
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.478
Have a seat, guys.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.353
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.555
It's an honor to meet you all.
This is a very exciting story.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.990
You all come from varied backgrounds.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.829
One of you is a Baptist minister.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.433
Is that Tank? Can I call you Tank?
Tank Sullivan.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.392
You may call me Tank.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.400
What is that?
That's a cross with a rocket on it.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.074
What faith is that?
I'm not familiar with it.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.269
- It's mine.
- Lutheran?

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.914
- What is it? What is it?
- It's Baptist.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.271
Which guy is the babe magnet?
That would be Jerry.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.198
- That's Jerry.
- Are you?

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.312
I keep telling these guys
it's got nothing to do with me.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.551
It depends entirely on the woman...

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.470
...and how willing she is to discover
her infinite supply of orgasms.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.079
- Really?
- Yeah, it's true.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.315
- It's the truth.
- You know, I think...

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.709
...women watching are going,
"No matter their age, men never change."

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.269
- You all have a military background?
I- That's true. That's true.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.074
North or South? Which side?
I'm teasing.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.759
- You see- I'm sorry.
- Low.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.315
I know, I know. You can't help it.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.108
What did he do?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.637
These go in the other pile.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.956
So the relay patch is the key?

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.278
Plain as the nose on your face.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.833
- How'd you bypass the heat exchanger?
- I didn't bypass anything.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.558
You're not being very forthcoming
on the guidance system.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.030
Kid, I've done everything
short of...

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.959
...calculus instructions to bring you
up to speed.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.993
What do you want, a picture?
Connect the dots?

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.076
Excuse me. I hold two master's
degrees from MIT, Dr. Corvin.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.236
Maybe you ought to
get your money back.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.876
You were just brought up on
a different set of technologies.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.039
You're compromising this mission. I'm
your backup on a need-to-know basis.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.039
You don't need to know dick.
I don't need a backup.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.355
Yes, you do.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.794
More than you know.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.119
What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.792
What don't I know?

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.918
What don't I know?

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.592
You son of a bitch.
You're setting me up again.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.272
Here's one of our astronauts now.
What a semi-pleasant surprise.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.314
- You had no intention of sending me up.
- I'm in the middle of something.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.598
Well, now, that's great.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.156
You hung up on the head of
our program: the U.S. vice president.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.670
- What can I do for you?
- You had no intention of sending me up.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:36.031
You screwed me over in 1958
and you're screwing me over now!

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.839
I screwed you over?

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.555
What did I do, make a deal with you
anyway? A chronic liar!

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.956
What deal? I didn't make any deal
with you. You blackmailed me.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.551
If you want to stick by your
so-called deal, then you lost.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.638
I don't have to send you up.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.029
What's all this?

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.757
It means someone on your team
didn't pass his physical.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.553
One of you has cancer.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.919
It's in his pancreas.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.678
And it's inoperable.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.469
Does he know about it?

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.190
Dr. Caruthers talked to him
this morning.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.198
Jesus.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.639
No.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.196
No. We're gonna get another
doctor and get another opinion.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.188
Not one that's on your payroll.
This is even low by your standards.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.595
You'll do anything
to keep me from going up.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.793
Oh, really?

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.396
So that's what this drama's all about.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.637
This whole time I thought
it was about your friend Hawk!

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.877
But it's really about your seat
on the space shuttle.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.439
You can just back off, because NASA
will send you up in the space shuttle.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.393
You, Jerry and Tank, regardless
of whatever deal you had with me!

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:03.632
- I don't understand.
- Come on. You're front-page news now.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.351
A genuine all-American hero. You've
made NASA popular all over again.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.433
Thanks to you, they'll get
their juicy budget infusion...

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.358
...they've been drooling over.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.673
You're going up, all right.
The vice president insists.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.232
I have to call the head
of the space program back.

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:26.113
You've got a lot of work to do
before we leave.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.353
And you shut the door!

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.798
This is my Blackbird.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.912
I retired this very airplane in 1990.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.828
And now...

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.194
...here we sit.

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:54.470
I've never actually seen one before.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.988
SR-71. This is what
a plane's supposed to be.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.876
This is ugly on the ground, leaks like
a sieve, but up around Mach one...

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.835
...the seals all expand, she dries up,
flies like a bat out of hell.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.037
I took her right to the limit.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.029
128,000 feet.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.910
She's only happy...

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.310
...going fast. It's not meant to sit.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.836
That's a lousy way to die,
just sitting around waiting...

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.393
- Is eight months the best I can do?
- They don't know.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.831
- There's chemo, radiation.
- Shit.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.439
I watched my wife go out that way.
I ain't doing it.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.752
The love of your life.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.950
What is a pancreas anyhow?

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:47.433
I mean, I don't know what
the damn thing does for you...

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:50.237
...besides give you cancer.

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:55.788
What kind of odds would
you have give you and me?

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.158
Better than 40.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.555
I know how much this flight
meant to you.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.320
Looks like I crashed another one.
I'm sorry.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.309
They want to take Jerry
and Tank and me.

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.952
That's great. You played them
fellas just right. That's good.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.709
- You said yes, didn't you?
- I didn't say anything.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.151
You don't want to blow it again.
This is your last shot.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.948
This isn't easy.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.913
Easy, hell.
Don't whine to me about easy.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.678
Put yourself in my shoes.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.348
You've been blaming me for 40 years.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.990
You're not laying this on me.
You choke this one, it's on you.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.555
- All on you.
- What would you do?

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.591
I'd leave your ass on the ground.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.028
I'll bet you would.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.231
To go into space? You bet your ass.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.159
In a heartbeat.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.551
Know what the worst day
in my life was?

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.190
The day you put the idea in my head
I could pilot a ship in space.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.239
I don't care what happens.
If this gets out to the press-

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.550
It's not about the press right now.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.591
But whether Roger or Ethan-

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.474
I'm not going up. Not without Hawk.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.113
- You're gonna blackmail me again?
- No, no.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.233
I'll teach Ethan what he needs
to know. I don't go if Hawk doesn't.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.676
- Any ideas, Miss Holland?
- Yes.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.838
Even with the cancer,
he still passed his physical...

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.397
...so there's no reason he can't fly
the mission. Especially with backup.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.955
You and Frank will put me
in the loony bin.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.595
Colonel Corvin? Miss Holland would
like you to wait here, sir.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.759
Team Daedalus, all of Team Daedalus...

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.110
...has a launch in 92 hours.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.310
So let's get rested and prepped.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.950
Okay. Yes.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.389
What's this?

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.994
Have a look.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.995
UTMC-coated, 1.66, super high index
lenses on a Flexon alloy frame.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.919
- Your prescription.
- My prescription?

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.876
Holy cow.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.435
Holy cow.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.159
I had them made for you.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.956
- You owe me dinner now.
- You'd go out with Spider-Man?

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.391
- If he'll buy me oysters.
- I'll buy you pearls.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.392
I feel like dancing.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.753
Bring that man back alive!

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.430
That's against my better
judgement, Barb.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.159
I won't let him die.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.791
General Corvin, General Hawkins,
welcome to Daedalus.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.436
- We're not generals, son.
- Just saying it like it ought to be.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.433
You're good to go, men.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.910
See you back on the ground,
Team Daedalus.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.199
Good luck.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.068
Well, we've only waited 40 years.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.158
What do you say, Reverend Tank?
Is a prayer in order?

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.799
I was just reciting
the Shepard's prayer.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.672
Alan Shepard's prayer.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.995
"Oh, Lord, please don't let us screw up."

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.156
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.759
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.636
Amen, Reverend.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.634
Let's have a comm check.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.956
- PLT.
- MS One.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.639
- MS Two.
- MS Three.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.795
MS Four.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.709
Fido, go. Guidance, go.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.788
EECOM, go.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.318
INCO, go.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.398
T- minus 15 seconds.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.995
T -minus ten, nine, eight, seven.

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.077
We have a go for main engine start.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.275
Three, two, one. Ignition.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.155
Liftoff of space shuttle Daedalus
and STS-200.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.199
How's it going?

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.229
Space will never be the same.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.319
Houston, this is Daedalus.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.073
Roll program.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.112
Roger roll, Daedalus.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.391
Thank you, God.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.956
Stand by for throttles up.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.720
Daedalus, you are go
at throttles up.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.269
Roger, Houston. Go with throttles up.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.635
Stand by for separation of SRBs.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.550
Stand by for SRB sep.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.356
Coming up to negative return.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.553
Negative return.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.272
Roger, Daedalus.
You are negative return.

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.719
We're just a dot.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.038
Two engines tal.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.476
Press to ATO.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.554
Houston, do we have a go
for orbit ops?

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.752
Roger, Daedalus.
You are go for orbit ops.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.759
Good work, guys.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:17.156
Four hours to intercept.
We're right on schedule.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.789
That's not what I'm worried about.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.593
Relax.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.917
Our man is up there with them.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.068
Ah!

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.835
It was worth the wait.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.633
- Yeah, it was.
- Thank you.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.993
I owe you one.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.190
Not a bad takeoff...

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.838
...for some rookies.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.673
You guys are over, over the edge.
You're in space.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.838
- Welcome to the club.
- Thank you, Roger.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.110
Okay, Daedalus has got Ikon
on the scopes.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.469
We should have a visual here
momentarily.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.637
Range, 5000 meters.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.275
Roger, Hawk, we have a visual here.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.236
Stand by for a 15-second burn.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.515
All right, get ready
to deploy the arm.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.718
Deploying the arm.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.395
2200 feet.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.315
Dead center.
Good driving up there, Hawk.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.193
Let's light them up.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:25.872
Stand by. T.I. burn in four,
three, two, one.

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.638
Hello, Ikon. How we feeling today?

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.355
Activating floods.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.349
Boy. Will you get a load of this?

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.918
Activating radar.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.320
- He's trying to get a tone on us.
- What are you saying?

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.313
Shut the radar down.
It's painting a target on us.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.788
Radar off.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.479
We're okay.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:22.635
No wonder the damn thing's orbit is
decaying. It's got to weigh 50 ton.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.194
Houston, this is Daedalus.
You see what we see?

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.197
Roger, Daedalus. We are...

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.675
...studying it from here.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.032
Stand by for a decision.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.751
It's got to have some kind of
self-defense mechanism.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.599
Our radar must've activated it.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.875
Can you grab it?

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.189
I can get it if Hawk
can get us in there.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.392
I'm just worried about the mass.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.114
I'm worried about this thing
getting pissed again.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.908
Does that look like
a communications satellite?

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.391
General, what modifications
have your people made here?

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.992
That grappling arm can't
handle that much stress.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:17.472
It's within operational limits.
Frank can latch on.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.119
I don't know about this.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:22.756
Our mission is to restore this
satellite. Let's get on with it.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.713
I won't let this crew get killed,
you included.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.840
Houston, Daedalus.
We're still standing by.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:39.073
- Give them a go to capture.
- Daedalus, this is Houston.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.350
You have a go for capture.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.670
- Here we go, gentlemen.
- Roger, Houston.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.956
We have a go for capture.
Pull it in, see what she looks like.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.151
Give me a minute to get it stable.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.713
How does that look?

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.912
That's close enough for me.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.759
- Is he as good as you say he is?
- Tank?

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.313
He's the man.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:34.119
All right. You can go for it.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.797
You're drifting left too far.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.633
Hail Mary, full of grace.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.356
Holy shit!
I got it!

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:56.955
You the man, Tank.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.634
Houston, Daedalus. We've got Ikon.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.319
Good work, fellas.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.711
You boys look mighty sharp.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.632
Welcome to space, Frank.
You've waited a while for this.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.477
Yeah. Only 40 years.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.074
All right, cowboys. Let's round
them up. We got work to do.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.117
A little light on the subject.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.717
We'll take a look at its brains.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.278
I don't think that's the panel.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.395
You don't, do you?

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.155
Holy cow, Frank.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:55.437
This is some piece of junk.

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.238
This isn't a sightseeing trip, Frank.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.315
- Abort activity.
- Frank, listen to me.

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.233
I said, abort activity. Now.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.997
What's going on, Frank?

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.478
Ethan, what the hell's going on?
What is this damn thing?

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:06.029
A Russian communications satellite,
colonel.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.119
Bullshit! You don't think I know a
nuclear launch platform when I see it?

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.710
Why are we helping the Russians
put a missile silo back into orbit?

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.076
You're a genius. You figure it out.

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.629
You're only here
as a publicity stunt!

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.309
You got what you wanted!
You're in space!

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.471
Now finish the damn mission!

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.799
Go ahead, Frank.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.070
You're on a secure line now.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:38.115
You were right to be concerned
about this thing coming out of orbit.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.551
It happens to have six armed
nuclear warheads onboard.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.988
What's he talking about?

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.792
I have no idea.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.355
General, is there something
you want to tell us?

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.114
Yes.

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.437
Ikon is a relic from the Cold War.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.278
It has floated dead in space
ever since the Soviet Union fell.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.269
There are six missiles onboard...

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.916
...targeted at strategic
American installations.

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.429
All, most regrettably...

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.198
...in large metropolitan areas.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.592
If Ikon goes offline...

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.353
...it will assume that...

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:21.998
...there has been a catastrophe
and will initiate launch on its own.

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:25.158
You picked a hell of a time
for a confession, general.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.237
Those are our boys up there.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.115
And that is a treaty violation.
A goddamn big one.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:32.958
You bastard.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:37.073
Bob, you don't know how touched I am
that you're worried about our safety.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.034
Why don't you ask your friend
the general...

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:44.074
...how my guidance system from
Skylab got aboard this six-gun?

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.594
It was stolen by the KGB...

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.997
...from Mr. Gerson's personal files.

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:58.236
This is all news to me.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:03.238
You'd have us put it back into orbit
fully armed and keep it a secret...

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.158
...just to save your ass?

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:10.319
People, we have a real problem here.

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.355
All right, huddle up.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.159
We got a big-ass problem.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:22.478
We're latched on to a 100-megaton
bomb traveling 17,000 miles an hour.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.874
What about that shit heap? You think
we can get it out into deep space?

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:32.277
Four payload assist rockets? Just.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.632
Maybe. I don't know.
Let me crunch some numbers.

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:42.713
Just okay, Frank.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.391
Somebody's outside the ship.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.679
Daedalus, you have an unscheduled
EVA you want to tell me about?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:52.989
What?

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.235
He's jammed the air lock door, Frank.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.556
Remove the panel and override it.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.919
Turn on the lights.

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.116
Ethan, what are you doing out there?

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.433
Ethan, what are you doing?

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.313
Your job, Frank.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.276
Putting Ikon back into geosync orbit.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.877
You don't know what you're doing.
Come back. That's an order.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.590
You don't know the sequencing.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.119
- Roger.
- Yeah.

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.113
Get suited up. When the door's fixed,
get out there.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.639
All right.

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.914
Ethan, do not connect those PAM
rockets. Do you understand?

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:00.910
How long?

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.109
I nearly got it.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.948
Don't lock onto those PAM rockets.
You hear me?

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:18.709
Got it.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.589
It's arming itself.

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.189
Oh, God!

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.434
Oh, Lord.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:39.949
- Hawk.
- I'm on it.

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:29.191
Shit, we got a fire in here.

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.158
- We lost Ikon and Ethan.
- What?

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.873
Roger's hurt, mid-deck.
He's bleeding badly.

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.436
See what you can do for him.

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:49.797
Tank, contain the situation.
Kill the O2 switch.

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.029
Killing it.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:53.037
Hawk and I are going out.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.468
I got it.

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.271
Status GBC.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:03.909
Check.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.878
They've got the fire contained.

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.992
Range, 100 feet. It's accelerating,
Miss Holland.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.952
They're gonna lose it.

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.839
I assume you got a plan.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.670
I think I can reconfigure the flight
control system for stabilization burn.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.997
The only trouble is, I gotta do that
at exactly the right time.

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.793
That's where you come in.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.991
You gotta be my eyes
while I'm in there.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:28.715
Cue me when the satellite comes around
and lines up with the shuttle.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.434
But what about the rate of descent?

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.872
I'll fire a short burst from the PAM,
and that'll counter-thrust.

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.674
Just enable the PAM rocket
to accept my command.

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.269
Hell, I thought this
was gonna be hard.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.118
Jerry, to make all this work...

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:45.754
...give me range and rate
of opening readings.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.554
Frank, you have one shot, maybe.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.830
You miss, you'll never make it back.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.396
If those bombs hit the atmosphere,
it might not matter anyway.

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:57.552
Come on, let's suit up
and get out of here.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.474
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.079
2200 feet.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.555
Holy cow. This is a bad idea.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.912
Frank, by my calculations,
you got 15 seconds...

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.872
...to ignite that PAM.

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.152
- Speak to me, Hawk.
- We're almost there, Frank.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:27.709
Five.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.717
- On a count of one.
- Four.

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.479
- One.
- Three.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.990
Two, one.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.630
On my mark, Frank, shut her down.

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.918
Five, four...

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.309
...three...

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.549
Come on, Frank.

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.512
...two, one...

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:27.709
...mark.

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.958
That's it, Frank. It's static.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.353
Okay.

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.959
Houston, this is Daedalus.
We've arrested the fall.

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.388
Attaboy, Frank!

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:50.278
Oh, thank God.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.598
Son of a bitch.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.829
He's out.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.159
I'll hook up the extra Payload Assist
Modules. You take Jonny Quest back.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.198
We've got a problem.
We've only got one rocket left.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:26.351
One PAM's got no chance of getting
that thing into orbit.

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.752
You got another problem.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.998
Oh, no. Even if we get
this thing going...

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.710
...it's not gonna have enough power
with two broken panels.

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.031
Take the kid back, I'll handle this.

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.756
How will you handle it, professor?
You're a pilot, remember?

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.117
I'll need all the extra O2 modules
you've got.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.152
What are you talking about?

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.679
No.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.157
I love you, but why do you
have to be such a killjoy?

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.555
Besides, you ever see a prettier moon?

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.592
What's he talking about, Frank?

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.629
You'd never make
a quarter of a million miles.

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.159
Oh, hell, yes, I will.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.477
I just gotta go halfway.
The moon's gravity will do the rest.

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.314
I'll fire them into outer space
and let them...

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:32.638
...self-destruct.

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.675
That's not a solution, Frank. One PAM
rocket's not nearly enough thrust.

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:44.270
Let's everybody slow down.
There's got to be another way.

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.994
There isn't.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.835
No.

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:51.628
No.

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.390
Gotta be a winner in every race.
Looks like it's me this time.

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.157
As usual, huh?

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.553
Oh, shit.

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:03.910
- He can't do that.
- What's the status here?

01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.872
What's the status here?

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:09.430
One orbital engine gone,
primary and secondary guidance system.

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:11.910
Hydraulics are questionable.

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.229
Roger?

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.959
He has a concussion.

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:18.878
Oh, God.

01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.198
With no Roger and no Hawk, Frank...

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.630
...you'll have to pilot this bird
by yourself.

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:33.354
And you'll have to do it dead-stick.

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:40.753
Don't look at me. I've flown nothing
bigger than a Cessna in 30 years.

01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:46.352
Looks like I'm getting the better part
of the deal here.

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.117
Stop laughing.
You used up all your oxygen, dummy.

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.958
Frank's hot-wired it for you...

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:19.392
...but the trick is, those missiles
run out of fuel in 20,000 miles.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.238
You launch them too soon...

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.398
...the warheads could find
their way back home to Earth.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:28.639
Too late, they'd run out of fuel
and then you'd be stuck with them.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.394
Is this gonna work?

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.955
I don't know.

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:36.874
All right, fellas...

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.396
...let's shoot this baby to the moon.

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:43.678
Count down to one, right?

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.599
On a count of one.

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:04.869
One.

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.591
Ikon has left our gravitational field.

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:06.429
Hawk was able to launch the warheads
into outer space.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.119
How's Daedalus?

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.950
We have a critical situation.

01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:16.309
The collision left us with one good
orbital maneuvering engine...

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.471
...and it's leaking fuel.

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:21.999
If there's not enough fuel
for a de-orbit burn...

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:25.108
It'll burn up, or it'll skip off.

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:27.791
What about guidance and avionics?

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:30.834
Well, the computers are unresponsive.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.875
The only thing operating
at 100 percent is their airflow.

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:40.391
They're gonna have to reenter the
atmosphere and set her down in manual.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:44.235
- That's impossible.
- Well, it's never happened before.

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:50.478
The only pilots alive who'd even think
about it are Roger and Hawk.

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.159
- Roger's wounded and Hawk's-
- Okay.

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:57.998
Let's get them as close as we can,
then abort the landing.

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.309
They'll have to bail out.
What are the survival probabilities?

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.631
20 percent at best.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.958
Zero if they try to set it down.
The bird's dead.

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.877
I doubt it would even glide,
with its structural damage.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.230
20 percent is better than zero.

01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.393
Okay.

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:38.196
- You still have that thing?
- Yes. She'll dance all the way home.

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:44.229
Daedalus.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.750
Stand by for Eugene Davis.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.389
The judgement here is to go for Florida.

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.955
We'll get you as close to Kennedy
as we can.

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.313
Now, you're still inverted.
And you're flying tail-first.

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:03.754
Ordinarily, the autopilot would
do a de-orbit burn to right you.

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:08.115
- But we don't have a computer, right?
- That's right.

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:11.917
You don't have much fuel left
in that engine, either.

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.319
Swell.

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.790
Stand by for de-orbit burn.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.995
That wasn't enough. Flip us around
and use the forward RCS prop.

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.349
Shit.

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:36.154
All right.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.228
Shit.

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:55.071
Easy, Frank. She's not a fighter jet.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.717
A flying brick.

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:00.073
I hope not.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:20.875
I'm gonna put her in a steep dive.

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.356
Make sure we don't overshoot.

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.876
I'll make a series of tight turns.

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:33.355
Spill off some of this speed.

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.317
Jerry, clip everybody in. At about
10,000, we should be over Florida.

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.596
Pop the hatch and get
everybody out of here.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.553
Ethan and Roger first.

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.190
Tank, you and Jerry after that.

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:49.029
I'll line her up for a ditch over
the ocean. You got that, everyone?

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.198
Come on, hold together.

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.470
You're going in too steep, Frank.

01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:07.437
She'll fall apart around us.

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.551
Hold together just a little longer.

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:32.117
Altitude 30 miles over Texas.

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.911
Come on, just a little longer.

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.352
Give me one more turn.

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.758
He's trying to call, sir.

01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.632
He's fried his antenna.

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.388
Trajectory, where is he?

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:19.632
He's on final, but way too hot.
He'll overshoot at this rate.

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:30.271
Coming up on 12,000.

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:32.795
Equalizing.

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:36.877
Jerry, blow that hatch.
Get everybody out of here.

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.308
Roger.

01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.789
Blowing the hatch.

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.189
One gone.

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:55.958
Tank, you get going too.

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.709
What about you?

01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:00.070
I'll line her up for a visual,
then I'm out.

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.789
Two gone.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:09.392
Get out of here. Do you hear me?
Get moving.

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.753
What the hell you guys doing?

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:16.791
We're a team, Frank.

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:19.591
Get out of here. That's an order.

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.758
We're staying.

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:25.758
Read out my airspeed, then.

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:29.308
500. Bring her up.

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.713
This is Recover Five.
You're way too hot.

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:37.909
Pull out now.

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:39.429
Negative, Recover.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.274
All right, give me airspeed.

01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.114
300. Gear coming.

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:47.909
Gear down.

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:52.432
All right, there's nothing to this.
Just tap the brakes a little bit.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.719
He's gone into a stall.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:10.709
Airspeed?

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.319
220.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:13.989
210.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:16.269
200.

01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.274
185. She's gonna stall, Frank.

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:24.589
Speed?

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:27.270
175. Drop the nose.

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:29.710
What do you say we drop the nose?

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:17.790
Wheels stopped. Daedalus is home.

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.399
Yeah!

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.156
Just a walk in the park, Frank.

01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:04.788
Hey, Gene.

01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.035
- Yeah?
- Never mind.

01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.590
I never doubted Frank Corvin
for a minute.

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:16.870
I brought him in on Project Daedalus
40 years ago and on this one too.

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.834
I'll tell you this: For commitment,
courage and consistency...

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.077
...this group blows away
all the teams I've ever had.

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.278
Do you think he made it?

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.553
Yeah. I think he made it.
