WEBVTT

00:03.834 --> 00:06.041
Gabe, be totally honest.

00:06.208 --> 00:07.750
For a pregnant woman,

00:07.834 --> 00:09.250
I'm really smoking, aren't I?

00:09.333 --> 00:10.500
Ba-bam!

00:12.750 --> 00:17.083
Yeah. I think silence
is my best option here.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.125
Okay. Well, I'm off to yoga.

00:20.208 --> 00:23.041
Oh, hey, before you go...

00:23.750 --> 00:25.583
this silly old thing.

00:25.667 --> 00:28.542
Can I get a quick signature
for this thing for school?

00:28.834 --> 00:30.667
A school thing? Oh.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.792
I hope this isn't another
note from your principal.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.583
Oh, look at that. Yes, that's interesting.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.583
It's gotten to the point
where "Dear Mrs. Duncan" is a stamp.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.709
You released a bag of crickets
in the library?

00:45.166 --> 00:46.375
Why?

00:46.667 --> 00:48.000
Crickets are noisy.

00:48.083 --> 00:49.250
The library is quiet.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.709
You try things.

00:52.625 --> 00:55.375
Let's see. I could try things
like grounding you,

00:55.458 --> 00:56.917
- cutting your allowance--
- Wow, Mom,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.166
you know, now that I'm getting
a better look at you,

00:59.250 --> 01:00.667
you are smokin'.

01:02.166 --> 01:04.041
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.542
Forget it, mister.
You've gone too far this time.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.917
Your father and I will discuss
your punishment later.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.125
All right, fine,

01:10.208 --> 01:13.208
but you still have to sign this.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.333
Wish I had a stamp.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.375
You know, I feel like when we're happy,

02:20.458 --> 02:22.250
- the whole world is happy.
- Right.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.000
- Guess again.
- Oh, hey!

02:25.083 --> 02:27.458
Wouldn't it be fun if we had
one of those cute couple nicknames

02:27.542 --> 02:28.750
where we combine our two names?

02:28.834 --> 02:30.458
- Like Brangelina.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.291
Right, okay. So, uh...

02:32.375 --> 02:34.792
Spencer and Teddy. Um...

02:34.875 --> 02:37.291
Oh, we could be "Spendy"!

02:37.375 --> 02:38.875
Do you like Spendy?

02:38.959 --> 02:41.834
I'd like for Spendy to hit me
over the head with a club.

02:42.959 --> 02:44.917
Well, I gotta go.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.417
- Basketball practice.
- All right.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.000
See ya later, Spendy.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.500
I like it.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.959
Ivy, why are people giving me dirty looks?

02:54.041 --> 02:55.959
Hmm, it could be anything, really.

02:56.041 --> 02:57.083
Your pants, your shirt,

02:57.166 --> 02:58.959
the fact that you're a jinx, your hair.

02:59.041 --> 03:00.625
Wait. Whoa, whoa. Okay, go, go back.

03:00.709 --> 03:02.417
I'm a jinx? Why would people think that?

03:02.500 --> 03:04.583
Well, ever since you and Spencer
got back together,

03:04.667 --> 03:06.625
the basketball team hasn't won a game.

03:06.709 --> 03:08.333
But that's ridiculous. Ivy, come on.

03:08.417 --> 03:09.875
You don't think I'm a jinx, do you?

03:09.959 --> 03:12.792
Well, I don't,
but the basketball team does,

03:12.875 --> 03:14.625
the coach does, the school nurse,
the janitor--

03:14.709 --> 03:16.208
I am not a jinx!

03:16.291 --> 03:18.041
If anything, I'm good luck.

03:22.375 --> 03:24.041
Sorry.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.000
Hey, looking good, Charlie.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.458
I know, Daddy.

03:38.125 --> 03:41.333
Yeah, you are your mother's daughter,
all right.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.208
Oh, I'm next! I'll take the race car.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.458
Hey, PJ, PJ. Um...

03:46.542 --> 03:48.166
Manager asked me to talk to you.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.041
- About what?
- Come here.

03:51.792 --> 03:54.667
He seems to think you're a little old
to sit in the race car.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.208
All right. I'll sit on the elephant,

03:56.291 --> 03:58.125
but my engine noises won't make any sense.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.166
Hey.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.667
You're old enough to vote.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.625
You're old enough to go
to a real barbershop.

04:05.709 --> 04:08.750
But real barbershops
don't give out stickers and lollipops.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.000
Maybe you can hold off on the voting
for a little while.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.166
Hey, you know what?
I'll take you to where I get my hair cut.

04:16.417 --> 04:17.917
Uh, no, thanks.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.250
You're 18.

04:23.917 --> 04:26.417
Time to leave the orange balloon
and grow up.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.000
Oh, great, rub it in my face.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.709
Can you believe what Gabe did?

04:39.792 --> 04:41.125
No, I can't.

04:41.959 --> 04:44.000
I mean, everybody knows
when you transport crickets

04:44.083 --> 04:46.625
you don't use a bag, you use
a lightly-ventilated box.

04:47.709 --> 04:50.667
Focus! Bob, we have to punish him.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.041
Man, he's been a handful lately.

04:53.125 --> 04:54.500
I know.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.834
Well, at least we don't have it
as bad as my friend Pam.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.917
She's one of the pregnant gals
in my yoga class.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.875
She has a son Gabe's age
who's so out of control

05:01.959 --> 05:03.625
they're sending him to military school.

05:03.709 --> 05:05.250
Bob: Military school?

05:05.917 --> 05:08.250
It's the only way, Bob.
You can't have a troublemaker

05:08.375 --> 05:10.208
like him around
with a new baby on the way.

05:12.250 --> 05:15.458
Still, I mean, isn't that kinda harsh
for a kid Gabe's age?

05:15.542 --> 05:17.041
What he needs is discipline,

05:17.125 --> 05:19.750
and that's what a school
like Graystone Academy can give him.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.875
Yeah, I guess.

05:24.583 --> 05:26.125
Hey, does he know it's happening?

05:26.208 --> 05:28.333
No, the trick is not to tell him.

05:28.417 --> 05:30.875
Then one day you say,
"Hey, buddy, get in the car.

05:30.959 --> 05:33.417
We're going for ice cream."
Then off you go to military school.

05:35.125 --> 05:38.083
- Wow. I don't know if I--
- It's done, Bob.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.458
And what do you care?
It's not like him leaving

05:40.542 --> 05:42.333
is gonna affect your life
one way or the other.

05:43.417 --> 05:44.667
Yeah, that's true.

05:52.959 --> 05:55.583
Excuse me, quick question.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.375
Do you give out prizes with your haircuts?

05:58.458 --> 06:01.750
Yeah, if I nick you,
you get a free bandage.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.625
That's a joke, right?

06:03.959 --> 06:05.291
Okay.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.291
Wow, I've really got
to cut down on the coffee.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.458
You know,

06:12.542 --> 06:14.792
I'm actually thinking about
letting it grow out anyways.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.291
Syd!

06:17.000 --> 06:17.917
Hi.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.166
- Hey.
- Have a seat.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.208
Well, since I'm here.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.417
- What's your name?
- I'm PJ.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.792
So what kind of cut would you like today?

06:28.875 --> 06:30.333
Uh, well,

06:30.417 --> 06:32.625
normally I go for the handsome prince,

06:32.709 --> 06:35.625
but today I'm thinking about changing
to the sporty rascal.

06:36.583 --> 06:39.625
Well, PJ, I think it's time
we gave you more of an adult look.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.917
How about we go...

06:43.417 --> 06:45.417
shorter on the sides

06:45.792 --> 06:47.917
and then we can layer it on top?

06:48.417 --> 06:49.542
Okay.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.750
Or we could go shorter on top

06:53.834 --> 06:55.417
and then leave it fuller in the back.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.792
Whatever takes the longest.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.333
Come on, let's get you shampooed.

07:04.875 --> 07:07.000
We're gonna get me shampooed.

07:13.959 --> 07:16.041
Okay, don't sugarcoat it.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.917
Does everyone think that I'm a jinx?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.208
Yes.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.375
Boy, no sugar there.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.375
Teddy, I'm sorry, all right?
It's one of those,

07:27.500 --> 07:30.500
- you know, sports superstition things.
- But it's so stupid.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.500
Yeah, I know, but everyone believes it.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.917
Well, then we'll just have to
convince them that I'm not a jinx.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
- How do we do that?
- You could play better.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.083
That's obviously not gonna happen.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.750
I guess you've never heard
of a sugarcoat either.

07:48.125 --> 07:50.250
I've got it. We have to break up.

07:50.375 --> 07:53.333
- Whoa. Break up?
- We don't need to break up for real.

07:53.417 --> 07:54.834
We'll fake break up,

07:54.917 --> 07:56.250
the team will think the jinx is gone,

07:56.333 --> 07:58.458
they'll relax, you guys can win again.

07:58.542 --> 07:59.750
That could work.

07:59.834 --> 08:02.041
Okay, so, uh, you know, what's our story?

08:02.125 --> 08:05.333
- Why, why are we breaking up?
- I met someone else.

08:05.417 --> 08:08.458
- Okay, but who?
- Serge LeFleur.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.875
- Excuse me?
- Serge was

08:11.959 --> 08:14.083
my imaginary boyfriend when I was eight.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.792
He, uh, he had a velvet beret,

08:16.875 --> 08:18.583
and rode a unicycle.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.917
So your imaginary boyfriend was a mime.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.583
Yeah, a mime who could make a layup.

08:27.667 --> 08:28.917
Hey!

08:32.875 --> 08:34.125
You won't believe this.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.917
Mom and Dad are sending me
to military school.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.417
Oh, this is terrible!

08:39.500 --> 08:41.417
Well, maybe for you,

08:41.500 --> 08:43.625
but I just doubled my living space.

08:44.542 --> 08:46.041
How can you say that?

08:46.125 --> 08:47.917
What, did I get the math wrong?

08:49.208 --> 08:50.917
I mean, I know I've been bad,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.291
but how can they just send me away?

08:53.375 --> 08:55.083
Well, you gotta hand it to Mom and Dad.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.250
When you're adding a new kid,

08:56.333 --> 08:57.667
you kinda wanna get rid of an old one.

08:59.458 --> 09:02.208
What about you?
You'll be leaving for college soon.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.041
Gabe,

09:04.125 --> 09:06.083
everyone knows I'm not going anywhere.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.333
Right, Charlie?

09:07.417 --> 09:09.458
- True dat.
- Mmm.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.000
They're sending me to some place
called Graystone Academy.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.250
Graystone Academy.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.166
Ah, found it. "Graystone Academy.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.083
Breaking boys' spirits since 1873."

09:24.375 --> 09:27.500
Okay, there, there has gotta be
some way out of this.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.208
Well, I'm not very good
at thinking of things.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.208
Okay, go on.

09:32.291 --> 09:35.000
No, that's it. I'm not very good
at thinking of things.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.375
I've got it.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.041
I'll just start behaving better.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.333
If I show Mom and Dad how good I can be,

09:41.417 --> 09:43.041
then they'll never send me away.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.583
Just one problem.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.875
Your plan requires you to be good.

09:46.959 --> 09:49.458
You have no experience in that.

09:49.542 --> 09:51.583
Well, I'm gonna have to learn.

09:52.041 --> 09:54.250
It's either that or I'm off
to military school.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.250
Bye-bye, Gabe.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.166
Hey, what were you dreaming last night?

10:05.250 --> 10:08.083
- You kept kicking me.
- I dreamt you were snoring.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.125
Oh, good morning.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.625
Table for two?

10:16.125 --> 10:18.458
- What's all this?
- You made us breakfast?

10:18.542 --> 10:20.750
Not just any breakfast, Dad.

10:20.834 --> 10:24.208
Three eggs filled with pancakes,

10:24.291 --> 10:27.125
bacon, and cold pizza.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.375
You made me a Boblette?

10:33.166 --> 10:36.166
And, Mom, a healthy breakfast for you.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.000
Oatmeal and fresh fruits.

10:38.083 --> 10:40.250
Okay, I wanna know what you did
right now, mister.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.500
I didn't do anything.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.250
I just realized what great parents I have.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.875
This is the best Boblette I've ever had.

10:47.834 --> 10:49.792
Gabe, seriously, I wanna know...

10:50.375 --> 10:53.333
Where you got blueberries,
'cause they're not even in season.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.458
I'll be back later to do the dishes.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.333
Oh, and, Dad,

11:00.166 --> 11:01.458
I made you lunch.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.834
I still think he's up to something.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.333
Oh, dear Lord, he made me a Bob-wich.

11:14.125 --> 11:17.083
Teddy, we have to talk right now.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.625
- About what?
- About you cheating on me.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.709
Well, I don't actually...

11:23.917 --> 11:25.917
Do we have to do this here,

11:26.333 --> 11:28.208
in front of everybody?

11:29.917 --> 11:31.333
You were saying?

11:32.125 --> 11:35.333
- I heard you're cheating on me.
- Crowd: Oh.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.041
Someone saw you with--

11:37.542 --> 11:40.125
with Sarge LeFloo.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.750
You mean Serge LeFleur?

11:43.208 --> 11:45.375
The handsome, dashing French boy

11:45.458 --> 11:47.208
who doesn't go to our school?

11:48.417 --> 11:49.792
Yeah, that guy.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.583
Oh, hold on.

11:53.375 --> 11:57.208
Oops. Oh, bonjour,
mon petit chou-chou. Ca va?

11:59.333 --> 12:00.792
This is awkward.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.375
- Good break-up.
- You too.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.792
- Hello, again.
- PJ, what's up?

12:20.875 --> 12:24.583
I noticed this morning that my sideburns
are a little uneven.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.417
- They are?
- Uh-huh.

12:28.709 --> 12:30.583
There, now they're even.

12:33.041 --> 12:36.125
Yeah, but this is kinda
my natural head position.

12:36.834 --> 12:38.458
It makes me seem folksy.

12:39.542 --> 12:41.000
Okay, have a seat.

12:54.208 --> 12:57.667
Done! Now you're folksy and even.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.125
Heard the news! Up top!

13:08.458 --> 13:11.583
- What news?
- You dropped him like he's hot,

13:11.667 --> 13:13.208
- even though he's not!
- Oh.

13:13.291 --> 13:14.792
Ivy, we're actually--

13:14.875 --> 13:16.375
- we're not really--
- I couldn't believe

13:16.458 --> 13:18.625
you got back with that dog
in the first place.

13:18.709 --> 13:20.375
Spencer and I are still together.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.834
You didn't let me finish.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.458
- I love dogs.
- Yeah.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.166
Yeah, see, we staged the break-up.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.667
After they win the game tonight,

13:28.750 --> 13:30.250
we'll tell everyone we're still together

13:30.375 --> 13:31.959
and they'll know I was never a jinx.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.458
- Ah.
- Heard the news!

13:34.542 --> 13:35.750
Up top!

13:38.000 --> 13:40.709
- We're still together.
- You didn't let me finish.

13:50.417 --> 13:52.375
"Just because.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.500
Love, Gabe."

13:55.667 --> 13:58.542
He must've done something
really, really bad.

14:00.917 --> 14:02.667
Has anyone seen Mrs. Dabney lately?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.417
Or maybe we're misreading this.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.583
What do you mean?

14:09.667 --> 14:12.917
Honey, maybe Gabe has finally
turned that corner.

14:14.125 --> 14:17.834
And maybe we should be giving him
some positive reinforcement.

14:18.166 --> 14:22.625
Well, I guess if he's trying
to be a good kid,

14:22.709 --> 14:25.041
we could try to be good parents.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.625
New territory for all of us, huh?

14:32.083 --> 14:33.333
Hey, buddy.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.041
Come on, get in the car.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.583
Get in the car? Why?

14:37.667 --> 14:39.542
- We're going for ice cream.
- No!

14:41.250 --> 14:43.542
No ice cream! You can't make me!

14:44.834 --> 14:46.750
Okay. Uh, yogurt?

14:47.792 --> 14:49.375
I know what's going on here

14:49.458 --> 14:51.125
and I'm not going down like this!

14:51.208 --> 14:53.625
- Get back! I won't go!
- Hey, whoa, whoa! Hey, Gabe!

14:53.709 --> 14:54.834
What are you doing?

14:54.917 --> 14:56.959
I don't want to go to military school.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.834
Military school?

14:58.917 --> 15:01.542
Don't deny it! I overheard you two
talking in the kitchen.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.333
Oh, you thought--

15:05.417 --> 15:08.041
You think that you're leaving today.

15:10.291 --> 15:13.333
Your departure date
is still being determined.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.917
It all depends on how
you behave, right, Bob?

15:18.709 --> 15:19.750
Right.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.375
I don't wanna go to Graystone Academy.

15:23.709 --> 15:25.750
I want my spirit to be broken at home

15:26.125 --> 15:27.542
by the people I love.

15:30.917 --> 15:33.834
Well, I guess I could call Colonel...

15:34.542 --> 15:35.458
Klink...

15:37.959 --> 15:41.709
and tell him that we might reconsider.

15:41.792 --> 15:43.458
Oh, thank you.

15:44.667 --> 15:46.834
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:46.917 --> 15:48.250
Now...

15:48.834 --> 15:50.917
There's a bathroom upstairs
that's not gonna clean itself.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.041
Okay, I'm on it. I'm on it.

16:01.166 --> 16:04.375
What's going on? Who is this?

16:04.375 --> 16:06.542
Um, my 4:30 appointment.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.000
Why don't you head back
to the shampoo station

16:09.083 --> 16:10.250
and I'll be right there?

16:11.041 --> 16:12.709
Shampoo?

16:12.792 --> 16:14.792
I thought that was our thing.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.041
PJ, you're not my only client.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.166
Oh, so now I'm just a client?

16:21.208 --> 16:23.750
You've always been just a client.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.792
Fine. Two can play this game.

16:28.041 --> 16:29.834
Jerry, gimme a shave, please.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.750
Sure, kid. Have a seat.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.583
- Oh, hey, T.
- Oh, hello, Ivy.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.375
Oh, I guess you've probably heard

16:44.500 --> 16:46.375
that Spencer and I broke up.

16:46.458 --> 16:49.417
So my new boyfriend Serge was busy,

16:49.500 --> 16:52.166
and I decided I'd come
and support the team.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.083
Why are you talking like that?

16:55.166 --> 16:57.500
Oh, Ivy, this is how I normally talk,

16:57.583 --> 16:59.834
especially now that I'm not a jinx.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.166
Yeah, this is gonna be a long game.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.083
If Spencer misses this shot, we lose.

17:11.709 --> 17:14.500
Oh! Oh, yes!

17:14.583 --> 17:16.375
Yes, yes, yes!

17:16.458 --> 17:18.041
- Whoo-hoo!
- What are you doing?

17:18.125 --> 17:20.792
I'm telling the whole world
we're still together!

17:20.875 --> 17:22.291
We never broke up!

17:22.417 --> 17:26.959
And since we won, I'm not a jinx! Ha!

17:28.083 --> 17:29.500
- Teddy.
- Hmm?

17:29.583 --> 17:31.500
The score is tied.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.125
Teddy: Oh.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.083
My bad.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.458
I have to make this foul shot to win.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.709
Okay. Yeah, carry on.

17:43.792 --> 17:44.792
Good luck.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.000
No pressure.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.250
If he misses this,
I would not wanna be you.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.625
Yes!

18:23.500 --> 18:25.709
- Now?
- Now.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.959
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

18:40.041 --> 18:42.750
The presentation just keeps
getting better and better.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.208
Well, what have we got on the menu today?

18:47.458 --> 18:50.375
I'm hoping for a breakfast Bob-urrito.

18:50.792 --> 18:52.083
All right.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.125
Voila.

18:55.917 --> 18:59.041
There's, uh, nothing here.
What's going on?

18:59.125 --> 19:00.959
I'll tell you what's going on.

19:01.041 --> 19:04.583
I did a little research
on Graystone Academy.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.625
There is no Colonel Klink.

19:10.500 --> 19:14.417
That's because he was replaced
by Captain Kirk.

19:15.625 --> 19:18.625
Come on, guys.
You were just messing with me.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.709
You were never gonna send me
to military school.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.959
No, we weren't,

19:23.083 --> 19:24.458
but we could.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.500
No, you can't.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.291
No matter how much trouble I get into,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
you guys love me too much.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.709
I'd, uh, love you a little more

19:34.792 --> 19:37.041
if you made me a breakfast Bob-urrito.

19:38.709 --> 19:42.208
And a bowl of oatmeal
with those yummy blueberries.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.875
All right, coming right up.

19:44.959 --> 19:46.709
Oh, but, uh, first,

19:46.792 --> 19:50.250
I'm, uh, gonna need you guys to sign this.

19:56.834 --> 20:00.250
Well, Charlie, uh,
Gabe's not going to military school,

20:00.333 --> 20:02.208
and I'm no longer considered a jinx,

20:02.291 --> 20:05.041
so, yeah, everything's looking good here.

20:05.125 --> 20:07.125
Hey, Charlie.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.291
Well, almost everything.

20:12.375 --> 20:13.875
What happened?

20:13.959 --> 20:15.792
Jerry, my barber, is what happened.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.709
- It looks painful.
- You should see my legs.

20:28.208 --> 20:29.875
And you're related to him,

20:29.959 --> 20:32.417
so good luck, Charlie.

20:44.166 --> 20:46.709
Where have you been?
The game's almost over.

20:46.792 --> 20:48.375
I was on a date.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.709
Oh, with who?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.542
Serge LeFleur.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.834
You know he's imaginary, right?

20:56.917 --> 21:00.041
Uh, don't listen to her, baby.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.709
What did I tell you about that unicycle?

21:03.792 --> 21:05.417
Take it outside.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.333
You got here just in time.
If Spencer makes this shot,

21:10.417 --> 21:11.875
we win the state championship.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.083
Crowd: Oh!

21:26.125 --> 21:28.000
Not in my house.
