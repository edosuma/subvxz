00:34.759 --> 00:36.925
- no problem.
- It's crazy far, man.

00:36.927 --> 00:39.792
Nah, that's just a
perspecto illusion.

00:39.794 --> 00:41.958
It looks far 'cause
the cliff's lower.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.959
- Eh, go for it.
- Whoo!

00:45.961 --> 00:48.426
- Shoot!

00:48.428 --> 00:50.494
- Almost.
- Not really.

00:50.496 --> 00:52.327
What?! Watch me, fool.

00:52.329 --> 00:55.595
Hup!

00:55.597 --> 00:58.795
Whoo! I did it!

00:58.797 --> 01:02.795

01:05.465 --> 01:07.963

01:07.965 --> 01:11.098
Or dudes or whatevs. It's
just a chore sometimes.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.430
Yeah, two people
is mad efficient.

01:13.432 --> 01:15.498
- Whoa!
- It's a beach brawl!

01:15.500 --> 01:18.432
Looks like they're
trying to drown a barn.

01:18.434 --> 01:21.332
That's not a barn.
That's a dude!

01:21.334 --> 01:26.266
Holy fizzle.

01:26.268 --> 01:29.867
What's going on here, tough boy?
What is that huge dude?

01:29.869 --> 01:33.701
He's the farm, the legendary
fighter of the shiney isles.

01:33.703 --> 01:37.602
I came here to participate in
his open challenge, but this

01:37.604 --> 01:40.602
mother can't be beat!
Give up, worms!

01:40.604 --> 01:46.103
My fight power is supreme! I'm
too freaking legendary for

01:46.105 --> 01:52.437
you!

01:52.439 --> 01:54.605
Train! Train! Train!

01:54.607 --> 01:57.605
Whoa! Train! Train!
Train! Train!

01:57.607 --> 02:00.873
I love you, the train! You're
almost as legendary as

02:00.875 --> 02:04.107
the farm, the train! The
train is gonna smack you

02:04.109 --> 02:07.774
down on his tracks! Whoo!

02:07.776 --> 02:12.608
Your caboose is mine! Choo-choo!

02:12.610 --> 02:16.943
Choo-choo! - Oh, my glob.

02:16.945 --> 02:20.609
Choo! Ow!

02:20.611 --> 02:24.044
My legs are backwards!

02:24.046 --> 02:26.444
Why? Ohh! You're mean!

02:26.446 --> 02:29.112
Did you just die?

02:29.114 --> 02:32.612
No. The train will chug on.

02:32.614 --> 02:36.512
My friend makes bionic legs.
I'll be better than before.

02:36.514 --> 02:38.947
I want bionic legs!

02:38.949 --> 02:41.446
Who's your friend? Yeah, right.

02:41.448 --> 02:43.647
It's secret!

02:43.649 --> 02:47.981
Don't follow me!

02:47.983 --> 02:50.315
- Train can do this.
- You don't want bionic

02:50.317 --> 02:51.547
legs. It ain't natchy.

02:51.549 --> 02:53.615
I don't care about natchy.

02:53.617 --> 02:56.449
Let's discuss this later.

02:56.451 --> 03:01.383
You guys want to fight me?

03:01.385 --> 03:03.383
You think we can beat him?

03:03.385 --> 03:05.951
Yeah way, we can't.
He's the ultimate!

03:05.953 --> 03:08.718
But if we beat him,
we'll be crazy legends.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.885
<i>Man, I already am a legend
in other aspects of life.</i>

03:11.887 --> 03:14.385
Third highest score in
"kompy's kastle," brah.

03:14.387 --> 03:18.453
<i>- Third. In the candy kingdom.
- Jake, that's your</i>

03:18.455 --> 03:21.121
<i>legend. This could
be our legend!</i>

03:21.123 --> 03:23.721
- Brogend!
- Okay, how are we gonna

03:23.723 --> 03:25.821
- beat him, then?
- Train!

03:25.823 --> 03:28.722
- He can't even walk.
- No, man.

03:28.724 --> 03:32.789
"Train up," like "get
ripped!" Yeah, I was just

03:32.791 --> 03:34.323
kidding. Let's destroy that guy!

03:34.325 --> 03:36.690
We're coming back
for you, the farm!

03:36.692 --> 03:38.790
After we train!

03:38.792 --> 03:41.457
- Yeah, that's cool.
- We're gonna annihilate

03:41.459 --> 03:42.958
you, the farm! Mm-kay.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.191
I'm gonna do a finishing
move on you!!

03:47.193 --> 03:51.192
All right! Yeah!

03:51.194 --> 03:53.626
- Come on, Jake!
- Ugh.

04:05.729 --> 04:09.728
- Huh! Hyah!
- Let's see your chokey

04:09.730 --> 04:13.562
brokey style.

04:13.564 --> 04:16.296
- Nice one.
- Yes.

04:16.298 --> 04:20.697
Now watch my... Something style.

04:20.699 --> 04:25.531
- Hyah!

04:25.533 --> 04:27.699
- Huh?

04:27.701 --> 04:30.699
Jake?

04:30.701 --> 04:33.633
- You're playing "kompy's kastle"?
- Huh?

04:33.635 --> 04:35.967
Whoo! Uh... Yes.

04:35.969 --> 04:39.068
Winning this battle could
take our reputation to a

04:39.070 --> 04:42.201
- whole new level!
- Look, I'm a full-grown

04:42.203 --> 04:45.969
dog of my own, and I need to
play "kompy's kastle" every day

04:45.971 --> 04:49.803
- so I can maintain my rank.
- So... You don't care

04:49.805 --> 04:52.402
- about fighting the farm?
- I never really take

04:52.404 --> 04:56.737
anything seriously.
Except "kompy's kastle."

04:56.739 --> 05:00.972
Hy-ah! Komp-y-y-y!!

05:07.740 --> 05:12.140
I'm gonna break every bone in
your body, then heal you later

05:12.142 --> 05:15.573
with that magical goo we got
from the cyclops's eye.

05:15.575 --> 05:17.407
Aah!

05:17.409 --> 05:20.007
- Ouch.
- Apologize!

05:20.009 --> 05:22.742
Never!

05:22.744 --> 05:26.375
I'm gonna turn up the

05:26.377 --> 05:29.309
- juice!
- And I'm gonna drink it!

05:29.311 --> 05:33.977
My little face!

05:33.979 --> 05:35.311
Ow!

05:35.313 --> 05:41.311
Where are you? Huh?

05:41.313 --> 05:42.845
- Huh?

05:42.847 --> 05:45.012
- Huh?
- Apologize for not

05:45.014 --> 05:50.514
taking training seriously!

05:50.516 --> 05:53.147
Come out, you chicken nug!

05:53.149 --> 05:59.515
Ow.

06:15.318 --> 06:19.318
Apologize to

06:19.320 --> 06:21.919
- "kompy's kastle"!
- No.

06:21.921 --> 06:27.820
You apologize for not taking training...
Seriously.

06:27.822 --> 06:35.822
Ugh, gross!

06:50.725 --> 06:54.558
Ow!

06:58.193 --> 07:01.592
Aah! My eyes! Cheap
move, you butt rag!

07:01.594 --> 07:04.926
You... You're the cheap move!

07:04.928 --> 07:08.561
Huh? Pants!

07:08.563 --> 07:11.161
I'm really gonna wipe you now.

07:11.163 --> 07:14.028
- Bring it on, bro!

07:15.696 --> 07:19.862
Ou-u-ch! Ow! Ow!!

07:19.864 --> 07:23.696
No biteys!

07:23.698 --> 07:27.197
I'm gonna down the farm

07:27.199 --> 07:29.898
- without you!
- I'm gonna knock down

07:29.900 --> 07:32.764
the farm just so you'll never
know the taste of downing the

07:32.766 --> 07:36.698
farm!

07:36.700 --> 07:39.032
Yo, guess what?

07:39.034 --> 07:41.933
Guess what, homey?
I put in the time.

07:41.935 --> 07:47.100
I'm-a make you mine.

07:47.102 --> 07:52.169
Yeah, that's right.
Come and get this.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.369
So, what... both
at the same time?

07:56.371 --> 07:58.369
I'm cool. You're gonna
fight this, the

07:58.371 --> 08:00.503
farm? Okay.

08:00.505 --> 08:03.670
Just me. I don't need
this clown town.

08:03.672 --> 08:07.004
The only way you're gonna
win is if you use your

08:07.006 --> 08:10.337
- cheap moves.

08:10.339 --> 08:13.438
Hey, come on.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.438
You got to fight the dude.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.173
I can't see!

08:18.175 --> 08:20.840
- Walk me to the light!
- Yeah, that's what you

08:20.842 --> 08:24.207
get.

08:32.442 --> 08:36.275
Cloud looks like a car.

08:37.777 --> 08:40.610
Awaken to your dream, finn

08:40.611 --> 08:42.409
- and Jake.
- Whoa!

08:42.412 --> 08:44.544
Who are you? I am
the dream warrior.

08:44.546 --> 08:47.677
I've summoned you here to hang
with me in your together dream.

08:47.679 --> 08:50.546
Are you gonna show us a
move to beat the farm?

08:50.548 --> 08:52.845
First, listen. Then wake up.

08:52.847 --> 08:55.412
All right. I have cheap cars.

08:55.414 --> 09:00.213
- My cars are che-e-e-ap.
- My cars are cheap.

09:00.215 --> 09:03.680
But they drive bad when
I turn out the lights!

09:03.682 --> 09:07.881
Turn out the lights. These
sweatpants have another

09:07.883 --> 09:10.015
- name.
- Another name.

09:10.017 --> 09:13.216
Yeah, don't you always call
sweatpants "give up on

09:13.218 --> 09:15.349
- life" pants, Jake?
- I do, because peeps

09:15.351 --> 09:18.517
need to respect themselves when
they leave the house, even if

09:18.519 --> 09:21.250
it's just for ice cream or t.P.
Or whatevs.

09:21.252 --> 09:25.185
Two shiny golden apples,
ripe enough to bite!

09:25.187 --> 09:27.118
Bite!

09:27.120 --> 09:29.119
That's all I got to say for now.
Get lost!

09:29.121 --> 09:31.618
What is going on
here, dream warrior?

09:31.620 --> 09:33.853
Yeah, what's this all about?

09:33.855 --> 09:37.020
Nap's over! Sorry!

09:37.022 --> 09:40.687
Whoa. That was a good nap.

09:40.689 --> 09:43.121
Hey, did you dream
about dream warrior?

09:43.123 --> 09:45.521
Yeah. What was he
trying to tell us

09:45.523 --> 09:47.354
- exactly?
- I don't know.

09:47.356 --> 09:49.455
I didn't get it.
But listen, man.

09:49.457 --> 09:52.923
I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who
cares about my high score in

09:52.925 --> 09:54.856
"kompy"? It ain't important.

09:54.858 --> 09:57.024
<i>No, man. It is important.</i>

09:57.026 --> 10:00.191
Being the third best at
something is math and deserves

10:00.193 --> 10:02.392
respect, not like
I did to "kompy."

10:02.394 --> 10:05.858
Anyway, I think we both got
cranky after all that training.

10:05.860 --> 10:09.425
Well, good thing we're rested,
'cause now we can beat

10:09.427 --> 10:11.193
- this beast.
- Yeah!

10:11.195 --> 10:12.927
Oh, hey! Look!

10:12.929 --> 10:15.226
The dudes came back
to watch us fight!

10:15.228 --> 10:17.961
A'ight. This is it. Let's
use what we learned in

10:17.963 --> 10:19.928
- training.
- Uh...

10:19.930 --> 10:23.361
All we did was fight dirty
with cheap... wait.

10:23.363 --> 10:26.028
My cars are che-e-ap. Che-e-ap.

10:26.030 --> 10:29.796
Dream warrior was telling
us which cheap moves to

10:29.798 --> 10:32.229
use on the farm!
Headlights mean eyes!

10:32.231 --> 10:35.597
- Mud in the eyes!
- Give up on life pants!

10:35.599 --> 10:38.730
Pull down his pants
like you did to moi!

10:38.732 --> 10:41.631
- Two golden apples!
- Mm...

10:41.633 --> 10:44.199
- I think I know what that means.
- Well, sure, I can make

10:44.201 --> 10:46.866
- a wild guess.
- You ready, man?

10:46.868 --> 10:50.366
Yeah, dude! Put your pants on.

10:50.368 --> 10:53.200
Okay.

11:49.662 --> 11:51.596
Ready? Yes.
