BARNEY: <i>Oh, boy, it's the creepy,</i>

00:08.330 --> 00:10.963
bug-eyed minister
from that culty church

00:10.965 --> 00:13.433
who kept asking us
if we're "pure enough to die."

00:13.435 --> 00:15.235
He's our best lead.
I should get this.

00:15.237 --> 00:17.854
James, unless
you have a minister,

00:17.856 --> 00:19.639
I don't want to hear it.

00:19.641 --> 00:21.407

BARNEY:
Dad!

00:38.927 --> 00:41.845
Barney. Oh, I can't believe
you're getting married.

00:41.847 --> 00:44.097
You've grown up so fast.

00:44.099 --> 00:48.334
Then again, I did miss
about 30 years of your life.

00:48.336 --> 00:50.770
Did I mention we got you
two things from your registry?

00:50.772 --> 00:53.439
Hey, can we buy you guys
a drink in a bit?

00:53.441 --> 00:54.774
Sure. We'll meet you
at the bar.

00:54.776 --> 00:56.059
Yeah. (laughs)

00:56.061 --> 00:57.393

All right.

Hey.

00:58.563 --> 01:00.463
Oh. Whoa. Look.

01:00.465 --> 01:02.065
My dad hasn't seen
my mom in years,

01:02.067 --> 01:03.283
not since he bailed on her.

01:03.285 --> 01:05.485
Oh, man, take it from a
fellow child of divorce,

01:05.486 --> 01:07.237
this could
get real messy.

01:07.239 --> 01:09.539
Loretta, good to see you.

01:09.541 --> 01:11.741
You, too, Jerry.

<i>from Quebec</i>

<i>with the neck trouble.</i>

06:10.319 --> 06:13.687

conspiracy is much more likely

06:59.035 --> 07:00.901

in an elevator is scary.

BARNEY: Stop.

09:24.006 --> 09:25.856
You stupid!
I won't stop.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.977
Where the heck is
this parasailing place?

09:29.979 --> 09:31.195
(laughs)
You know what?

09:31.197 --> 09:32.863
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna call Jerry.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.198
(beep)

09:34.200 --> 09:35.366
Oh, that's weird.

09:35.368 --> 09:37.201
I just lost cell reception.

09:37.203 --> 09:39.036
Yes.

09:39.038 --> 09:41.622
Weird.

09:42.908 --> 09:46.327
Lot of pretty paintings
in this hotel.

09:46.329 --> 09:48.462
I like how
they've been... framed.

09:48.464 --> 09:51.081
I've noticed
the vintage, antique,

09:51.083 --> 09:52.633
gilded Victorian frames, too.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.719
I'm not blind...
but what are you getting at?

09:55.721 --> 09:57.354
You know damn well
what I'm getting at!

09:57.356 --> 09:59.223
You're jealous I got
the Best Mansmanship back,

09:59.225 --> 10:01.542
<i>so you destroyed that photo as</i>
<i>part of some diabolical scheme</i>

10:01.544 --> 10:03.427
<i>to make me look bad.</i>

10:03.429 --> 10:05.346
<i>I bet you even found some other</i>
<i>photo of Wayne Gretzky</i>

10:05.348 --> 10:06.514
so you could swoop in
and save the day.

10:06.516 --> 10:07.848
You're insane.
Am I?

10:07.850 --> 10:08.983
Yeah. Yeah.
Am I?

10:08.985 --> 10:11.735
Where were you today
at 3:15 p.m.?

10:11.737 --> 10:13.904
Right here
getting a massage.

10:13.906 --> 10:16.190
Rocked a 60-minute
deep tish.

10:16.192 --> 10:18.108
Now if you'll excuse
me, Detective,

10:18.110 --> 10:20.227
I think I'll go
have some pineapple.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.746
How do you know about that?

10:22.748 --> 10:25.032
Everybody knows about that!

10:25.951 --> 10:28.169
Excuse me?
Mm?

10:28.171 --> 10:29.920
You destroyed that photo,
didn't you?

10:29.922 --> 10:31.071
No, I didn't.

10:31.073 --> 10:32.406
Admit it! I complained about you

10:32.408 --> 10:34.875
to the bell captain,
so you got your revenge.

10:34.877 --> 10:36.544
You complained about me?

10:37.362 --> 10:40.047
No.

10:42.133 --> 10:44.101
So, Claude...

10:44.103 --> 10:46.387
I see that you're
a Montreal Canadiens fan.

10:46.389 --> 10:49.390
Which means you hate
the Edmonton Oilers,

10:49.392 --> 10:51.559
which is why you destroyed
the Wayne Gretzky head shot!

10:51.561 --> 10:52.643
<i>J'accuse!</i>

10:52.645 --> 10:54.428
<i>C'est ridicule!</i>

10:54.430 --> 10:55.980
If it's so <i>ridicule,</i>

10:55.982 --> 10:58.983
how do you explain this?

10:58.985 --> 11:00.818
Ah, seems
like I've caught you...

11:00.820 --> 11:03.437
midnight blue-handed.

11:03.439 --> 11:04.955
Oh, these.
Yeah.

11:04.957 --> 11:07.575
I-I was out by the water when...

11:07.577 --> 11:11.212
an elderly R-Rastafarian
hang glider...

11:11.214 --> 11:13.664
he-he crash
onto a beached squid,

11:13.666 --> 11:17.751
which squirted ink
when I ran in to help.

11:17.753 --> 11:19.786
You really expect me
to believe that?

11:19.788 --> 11:22.790
Story checks out.

11:22.792 --> 11:24.725
Sorry, Claude.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.261
<i>De rien.</i>

11:27.263 --> 11:29.013
I don't get it.

11:29.015 --> 11:29.980
We were bonding.

11:30.932 --> 11:34.435
I can't think of
anything I did wrong!

11:34.437 --> 11:36.303
Okay, I did a few things wrong.

11:36.305 --> 11:37.688
For the last time,

11:37.690 --> 11:41.808
I did not leave the bag of
oranges you bought on the roof!

11:44.145 --> 11:46.780
No more breaking the
speed limit. And, uh,

11:46.782 --> 11:50.367
thanks for flagging me down and
telling me she was going 67.

11:50.369 --> 11:52.202
Just following the rules,
Officer.

11:52.204 --> 11:55.489
Oh. She's also not
wearing her seat belt.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.010
You are not allowed
to use that word!

12:00.012 --> 12:02.263
Only <i>we're</i> allowed
to use that word!

12:02.265 --> 12:04.632
I am so sorry.

12:04.634 --> 12:05.516
I will never

12:05.518 --> 12:08.135
call you or anyone else a...

12:08.137 --> 12:10.054
Trekkie again.

12:10.056 --> 12:12.556
But I apologized
and you accepted.

12:12.558 --> 12:14.858
I even bought you more oranges.

12:19.531 --> 12:22.349
Look, it wasn't you, okay?

12:22.351 --> 12:25.719
Baby, I know your speech
at the Model U.N. is a big deal,

12:25.721 --> 12:28.205
but I'm just not sure
I'll make it in time.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.623
I'm trying.

12:29.625 --> 12:30.824
You know what?

12:30.826 --> 12:32.543
Don't bother coming.

12:36.331 --> 12:38.499
So, back at the airport,
that story was true?

12:38.501 --> 12:39.533
You have a daughter?

12:39.535 --> 12:41.251
She lives with her dad.

12:41.253 --> 12:44.705
And since I travel for work,
I miss a lot of stuff.

12:45.757 --> 12:49.009
I only work as hard as I do
to provide for her.

12:49.011 --> 12:52.346
But kids,
they don't understand logic.

12:52.348 --> 12:54.815
Kids understand who shows up.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.183
That's why

12:56.185 --> 12:57.818
her dad's her hero...

12:57.820 --> 13:01.572
and I get hung up on.

13:01.574 --> 13:03.073
Go see your daughter's speech.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.159
If you show up,
all will be forgiven.

13:05.161 --> 13:06.410
Just drop it.

13:07.028 --> 13:08.362
And drop me at home.

13:08.364 --> 13:09.947
Then head out to your wedding.

13:09.949 --> 13:11.582
End of discussion.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.252
Barney,
even if your plan worked,

13:15.254 --> 13:16.920
you'd be destroying
your dad's marriage.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.072
Okay, you may have a point.

13:19.074 --> 13:20.207
Can I suggest something?

13:20.209 --> 13:20.907
(sighs)

13:20.909 --> 13:21.925
Truce?

13:21.927 --> 13:23.910
We both agree to drop this.

13:23.912 --> 13:25.912
Agreed.

13:25.914 --> 13:27.364
Hey, I got a replacement bottle

13:27.366 --> 13:30.184
of 30-year Glen McKenna.
Okay.

13:30.186 --> 13:32.553
Look, even if Mom
never gets back together

13:32.555 --> 13:35.305
with either one of our dads,
we're still brothers.

13:35.307 --> 13:37.274
It's not a competition.

13:37.276 --> 13:39.560
(chuckles)

13:41.946 --> 13:43.113
I win!

13:43.115 --> 13:45.282
Hoo-hoo!

13:47.435 --> 13:49.657
Get your damn
hands off my mom!

13:49.658 --> 13:51.375
Get your damn hands
on my mom!

13:51.377 --> 13:52.709
One on, one off?

13:52.711 --> 13:54.845
What the hell is
going on here?

13:54.847 --> 13:56.980
After you boys tracked Sam down
a few years back,

13:56.982 --> 13:58.949
we got in touch.
We became friends again,

13:58.951 --> 14:00.984
started hanging out.
And then one day,

14:00.986 --> 14:03.420
she went from being
Loretta to being...

14:03.422 --> 14:05.555
Lo-ret-ta.
(chuckles)

14:05.557 --> 14:06.974
We wanted to wait
to tell you

14:06.976 --> 14:08.191
because it's still new,

14:08.193 --> 14:10.060
but it was inevitable
you'd find out

14:10.062 --> 14:12.396
once Sam came
to perform the ceremony.

14:12.398 --> 14:13.847
Is that what you
two call it?

14:13.849 --> 14:16.233
"Performing
the ceremony"?

14:16.235 --> 14:17.484
Oh, Sam's marrying you
tomorrow, dear.

14:17.486 --> 14:20.020
Right. Thank you, Reverend.
Look,

14:20.022 --> 14:22.539
is there any way you guys
can be all right with this?

14:22.541 --> 14:24.741
Of course I am!
(clears throat)

14:24.743 --> 14:27.377
Barney?

14:27.379 --> 14:30.330
I know I've been acting crazy
today, but...

14:30.332 --> 14:32.549
I just have
one real question, Mom,

14:32.551 --> 14:34.367
and I want an honest answer.

14:35.136 --> 14:36.136
Is there a scenario--

14:36.138 --> 14:37.170
and hear me out--

14:37.172 --> 14:39.339
where you might consider

14:39.341 --> 14:41.875
doing kind of a three-way deal
with both of our dads?

14:41.877 --> 14:44.061
God! What is wrong with you?!
Oh, dude, come on!

14:44.063 --> 14:46.313
(sobs)
That's what I thought!

14:48.766 --> 14:51.018
It's time to
admit it, Ted.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.654
You spilled the ink.
There's no conspiracy.

14:53.656 --> 14:55.022
I guess you're right.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.440
I mean, the only other person

14:56.442 --> 14:58.742
who saw Barney give me
that photo...

14:58.744 --> 14:59.993
was you.

14:59.995 --> 15:01.745
(dramatic sting)

15:01.747 --> 15:03.063
Hey. Idiot.

15:03.065 --> 15:04.731
While you've been

15:04.733 --> 15:07.117
playing detective,
I've been cleaning up your mess.

15:07.119 --> 15:10.236
Look, the ink remover works.

15:10.238 --> 15:11.004
I'm gonna
finish this.

15:11.006 --> 15:13.090
You come clean to Barney.

15:13.092 --> 15:14.574
(sighs):
Okay.

15:14.576 --> 15:16.626
She's been
missing all day,

15:16.628 --> 15:20.881
a-and I found what appears to be
a-a suicide note on my bed.

15:20.883 --> 15:23.350
But it doesn't
really sound like her.

15:23.352 --> 15:27.854
"I'm going to kill my--
wait for it-- self."

15:29.440 --> 15:31.274
Is everything okay
with Mr. Zabka?

15:31.276 --> 15:35.261

that's Billy Zabka?

But that's what happened
for James.

17:36.718 --> 17:39.069

Well, think about it.

18:24.783 --> 18:27.067
<i>but signed in my name.</i>

18:27.069 --> 18:30.436
<i>Then I switched the Gretzky</i>
<i>head shot with one of myself.</i>

18:30.438 --> 18:33.206
<i>I always travel with 2,000</i>
<i>of those handsome devils</i>

18:33.208 --> 18:35.408
<i>in the trunk of my car.</i>

18:36.827 --> 18:39.746
I have so many questions
for you, but first...

18:39.748 --> 18:43.166
you keep 2,000 head shots
of yourself in your trunk?

18:43.168 --> 18:44.968
No one ever wants them!
They only want

18:44.970 --> 18:47.170
the "good guy's" autograph!

18:47.172 --> 18:49.806
In the '80s, I was the bad guy
in every movie.

18:49.808 --> 18:52.425
Do you know what my life
has been like?

18:52.427 --> 18:55.812
<i>Every premiere,</i>
<i>when I came on-screen...</i>

18:55.814 --> 18:56.980
(crowd booing)

18:56.982 --> 18:58.565
<i>I wasn't a bad guy</i>
<i>in real life,</i>

18:58.567 --> 19:00.400
<i>just a kick-ass actor.</i>

19:00.402 --> 19:01.818
<i>No one got that.</i>

19:01.820 --> 19:03.970
<i>It happened everywhere I went.</i>

19:03.972 --> 19:06.606
(crowd booing) <i>Somehow,</i>
<i>people always had popcorn.</i>

19:06.608 --> 19:10.577
<i>25 years of getting</i>
<i>crane-kicked in the nuts,</i>

19:10.579 --> 19:14.447
<i>until Barney Stinson gave me</i>
<i>the best moment of my life.</i>

19:14.449 --> 19:17.083
Hey. Hey, some issues
just came up with Ted, so...

19:17.085 --> 19:18.335
will you be my best man?

19:18.337 --> 19:19.703
Sure.
Thanks.

19:22.623 --> 19:24.791
WOMAN: Hello?
Mom?

19:24.793 --> 19:26.760
(booing)
No, no, listen, listen.

19:26.762 --> 19:29.012
I just became
somebody's best man.

19:29.014 --> 19:32.665
(gasps) You can come
to Thanksgiving this year!

19:32.667 --> 19:35.001
To Barney Stinson,
I wasn't a bad guy.

19:35.003 --> 19:39.339
To Barney Stinson, I was
the best man.

19:39.341 --> 19:43.059
I thought if Ted screwed up
again, I'd have another shot.

19:44.111 --> 19:46.613
But I guess this time
I really was the bad guy.

19:46.615 --> 19:48.281
Hey, Ted,
what's so urgent?

19:48.283 --> 19:50.867
I have something
to tell you.

19:50.869 --> 19:52.152
(sighs)

19:52.154 --> 19:54.687
I destroyed
that Gretzky head shot

19:54.689 --> 19:57.190
and I couldn't fix it.
Billy saved the day

19:57.192 --> 19:59.960
by getting a new one
from an autograph dealer nearby.

19:59.962 --> 20:01.127
A-An hour away.

20:01.129 --> 20:03.163
An hour away. Just be cool.

20:03.165 --> 20:05.131
Awesome. Thanks, Billy!

20:05.133 --> 20:06.466
(chuckles)

20:06.468 --> 20:09.085
Ah.

20:09.087 --> 20:11.054
And, Ted...

20:11.056 --> 20:13.423
I really appreciate
that you told the truth.

20:13.425 --> 20:15.141
Ow...
Psych!

20:15.143 --> 20:16.676
Billy rules,
Ted drools,

20:16.678 --> 20:17.877
Stinson out.

20:19.730 --> 20:21.765
You're all right, Mosby.

20:21.767 --> 20:25.235
NARRATOR: <i>And for an all too rare moment</i>

20:25.237 --> 20:26.719
