(mellow music playing)

00:49.433 --> 00:50.633
Thank you.

00:56.300 --> 00:58.433
Rose, what are you
hiding behind your back?

00:58.500 --> 01:01.467
-Nothing.
-What smells so awful?

01:01.533 --> 01:05.500
-A fragrance I'm wearing.
-I don't have to ask this,

01:05.567 --> 01:08.533
but you're aware toilet water comes
in a bottle?

01:10.600 --> 01:13.233
Here. Oh. Cat food.

01:13.300 --> 01:17.700
-Are you feeding those strays again?
-I can't help it, Dorothy.

01:17.767 --> 01:21.967
I heard them howling and moaning.
Can you ignore that?

01:22.033 --> 01:25.767
I'm used to it.
My room's next to Blanche's.

01:29.533 --> 01:31.934
Boy, something smells good.
What's for lunch?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.867
-It's cat food, Sophia.
-Seafood medley?

01:36.567 --> 01:40.066
-Yes, it is.
-We ate that at the home.

01:40.133 --> 01:43.667
Ma, they didn't make you
eat cat food there.

01:43.734 --> 01:45.834
I didn't say they made us eat it.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.133
You have the option to go hungry.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.200
-By the way, I'm moving out.
-Wait. Come back here.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.467
-What do you mean, moving?
-Your brother Phil called again.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.100
Sally left him for good.
She took the four kids away.

02:02.166 --> 02:06.066
-I thought they had six kids.
-She left two behind.

02:06.133 --> 02:09.767
If they cross state lines,
it's a parole violation.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.567
-You mean you're moving for good?
-Not for good.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.367
Just to help raise the kids.

02:16.433 --> 02:19.000
I'll be back when they
graduate high school.

02:19.467 --> 02:23.467
Let's see... they're 14 now.
That should be... 10-12 years.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.467
You can't run to Phil
every time he has problems.

02:28.533 --> 02:32.333
-I came here to help you.
-I didn't have problems.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.266
You came here because
the home burned down.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.500
That's right, Sophia.
Don't you remember?

02:39.533 --> 02:41.800
-Hi, there.
-Ma.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.500
-Ma, what's the matter?
-Everyone is fine. No one died.

02:45.567 --> 02:46.734
The home burned down.

02:48.233 --> 02:51.233
-Are you all right? How'd you get here?
-I hitched.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.066
-Oh, Ma!
-A cab. I took a cab.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.734
Well, you should've called.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.033
I'm perfectly capable of managing
by myself. I don't need help.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.000
-I'm a totally independent person.
-I know, I know.

03:02.066 --> 03:04.233
I need $67 for the cab.

03:05.767 --> 03:08.266
Sixty-seven dollars!

03:09.166 --> 03:10.734
Ma. Ma, this is crazy.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.800
The home is 15 minutes from here.

03:12.867 --> 03:14.133
My cab driver is Cuban.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.934
He said there's an additional tax
for a bilingual driver.

03:18.734 --> 03:20.166
I'll take care of him.

03:21.467 --> 03:24.533
Sit down, Sophia.
You must be exhausted.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.834
Why? I rode in the cab,
I didn't push it.

03:29.100 --> 03:32.233
Oh, Sophia, honey,
how nice to see you.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.300
Who are you?

03:34.367 --> 03:37.500
-It's me, Blanche.
-You look like a prostitute.

03:39.967 --> 03:43.700
Sophia, the things you say.
She didn't mean that, Blanche.

03:43.767 --> 03:47.000
Of course, I mean it. Look at her.
My cab driver would fall in love.

03:48.433 --> 03:50.700
-(doorbell rings)
-I'll get it.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.100
-Harry.
-Ah, my pretty.

03:55.166 --> 03:58.100
Oh, Harry. Everybody, this is Harry.

03:58.166 --> 04:01.734
-Harry, this is Rose and Dorothy.
-Hi, Harry.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.200
And this is Sophia.

04:03.734 --> 04:07.967
-Well, you must be Blanche's sister.
-You must be blind.

04:11.433 --> 04:15.266
-Sophia's home burned down.
-That's terrible.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.600
Not to me.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.867
It was a retirement home.

04:18.934 --> 04:22.734
They pulled the fire alarm
in a retirement home.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.867
Who can rush?

04:23.934 --> 04:29.967
Half the people have walkers,
but they got bells going off like crazy.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.800
You know what that does
to hearts that beat a few times a week?

04:36.100 --> 04:37.367
It's not pretty.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.633
We better go. We have reservations.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.734
Take her to a cold climate.

04:46.934 --> 04:51.066
-Good night. It was a pleasure.
-Nice meeting you. Have fun.

04:51.567 --> 04:53.533
The man is a scuzzball.

04:58.166 --> 05:03.934
We've lived together a long time.
How can you announce you're leaving?

05:04.000 --> 05:08.667
Well, warden, I could make a break,
but you'd shoot me going over the wall.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.100
Couldn't you just visit Phil?
You don't have to move permanently.

05:14.166 --> 05:17.700
You won't be comfortable.
They live in a trailer.

05:17.767 --> 05:20.967
You won't have privacy.
You won't get your own bedroom.

05:21.033 --> 05:24.266
We have our own rooms.
I still don't get privacy.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.400
One of us shares a bed.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.166
Every time someone visits,
I'm in your room,

05:30.233 --> 05:33.233
you're in my room, she's in her room...

05:33.300 --> 05:35.066
-Look at me.
-What?

05:35.800 --> 05:37.734
-You're getting a cold.
-No, I'm not.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.800
Yes, you are.
Tomorrow you'll have a cold.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.000
What is this,
<i>The Curse Of The Cat Woman</i>?

05:43.600 --> 05:45.867
I'm a mother. I know these things.

05:45.934 --> 05:47.734
-Good night, Ma.
-Good night.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.100
What's that smell?

06:03.600 --> 06:04.867
I don't smell anything.

06:05.967 --> 06:07.333
Are you wearing something?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.700
A little bengay on my knees.

06:12.533 --> 06:14.133
A little Vicks on my chest.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.734
A little deep heat on my neck.

06:21.533 --> 06:24.867
What are you trying to do,
pickle yourself so you'll live to be 100?

06:25.900 --> 06:29.000
Fine. I'll wipe it off.
Tomorrow, I'll be in a wheelchair.

06:29.066 --> 06:30.900
-Good night, Ma.
-Good night.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.700
Keep it up,
I'll do the Dramamine.

06:45.033 --> 06:47.233
-Ma...
-Is it morning already?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.200
-I wanted to ask you something.
-What?

06:52.600 --> 06:57.333
How would you react
if you heard one of your kids was gay?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.900
Your brother Phil is gay? I knew it.

06:59.967 --> 07:03.033
We couldn't keep him from those
<i>Gladiator</i> movies.

07:04.266 --> 07:07.200
-Ma, Phil is not gay.
-You mean you're gay?

07:07.266 --> 07:10.300
Your friend Jean is having
a membership drive?

07:11.400 --> 07:12.400
Ma.

07:12.467 --> 07:16.533
Dorothy, I know you don't get many dates,
but stick with what you know.

07:20.367 --> 07:23.300
At your age, it's hard to try something
new.

07:23.767 --> 07:27.066
-Good night.
-Ma, I am not gay.

07:27.133 --> 07:29.633
I just wanted to get your reaction.

07:31.133 --> 07:32.767
I'll tell you the truth.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.767
If one of my kids was gay...

07:35.266 --> 07:37.433
I wouldn't love him one bit less.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.300
I'd wish him happiness.

07:40.867 --> 07:44.700
You're the greatest mother in the world,
and I love you.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.100
Fine.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.567
Now keep your fat mouth shut
so I can sleep.

07:56.967 --> 07:59.033
Jean thinks she's in love with Rose.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.767
Ha.

08:09.667 --> 08:13.800
-Ma, come on. It's not funny.
-The hell it's not.

08:13.867 --> 08:16.633
Jean in love with little miss muffet.
Come on!

08:21.033 --> 08:22.633
What is going on?

08:22.700 --> 08:23.767
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

08:25.066 --> 08:30.166
-I heard you laughing. What's so funny?
-For starters, Jean is a lesbian.

08:32.867 --> 08:34.400
What's funny about that?

08:34.900 --> 08:37.500
-You aren't surprised?
-Of course not.

08:37.567 --> 08:41.800
I've never known any personally,
but isn't Danny Thomas one?

08:51.767 --> 08:54.500
Not Lebanese, Blanche.

08:55.867 --> 09:00.233
-Lesbian.
-Lesbian!

09:01.800 --> 09:02.967
Lesbian!

09:04.967 --> 09:07.066
But isn't that where
one woman and another--

09:07.133 --> 09:09.600
We know what it means.

09:09.667 --> 09:13.400
But Jean's very attractive.
She could have any man she wants.

09:13.467 --> 09:16.033
-She doesn't want them.
-Why not?

09:16.467 --> 09:19.967
A man has so much more to offer.

09:20.567 --> 09:25.400
I found that out when Mark Perper ran
for president in the third grade.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.367
What does that mean?

09:27.433 --> 09:30.700
His campaign slogan was, "vote for me,
and I'll show you my wee-wee."

09:40.200 --> 09:41.900
He won by a landslide.

09:43.567 --> 09:47.934
I'll never understand
what Jean doesn't see in men,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.967
-but if she's happy, that's fine by me.
-There's one other thing.

09:52.033 --> 09:54.233
Jean's in love with Rose.

09:54.934 --> 09:56.033
Rose?

09:57.700 --> 09:59.934
Jean has the hots for Rose...

10:01.467 --> 10:05.300
-I do not believe it!
-I was pretty surprised myself.

10:05.367 --> 10:06.367
I'll bet.

10:06.934 --> 10:10.767
To think Jean would prefer Rose over me!
That's ridiculous!

10:14.734 --> 10:17.200
-Blanche, please!
-Tell me the truth.

10:17.266 --> 10:22.600
Would you pick me or Rose?
Blanche, pull yourself together!

10:23.967 --> 10:25.033
Oh.

10:25.567 --> 10:26.567
I'm sorry.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.467
-Does Rose know?
-No.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.600
Oh, good. Don't tell her.

10:34.667 --> 10:39.200
She's not as worldly and sophisticated
about these things as I am.

10:39.934 --> 10:42.734
If she finds out
Danny Thomas is a lesbian,

10:42.800 --> 10:44.100
it'll break her heart.

10:58.567 --> 11:01.867
Salvadore, if you want to fool around,
take off your t-shirt.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.100
You're going to get linguine all over me.

11:08.867 --> 11:12.400
Ma, Ma, go back to sleep.
It's just me, Dorothy.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.734
Get the hell out of my bed!

11:15.767 --> 11:18.834
Ma, have a heart.
The heat went out again.

11:18.900 --> 11:22.567
I'm freezing.
You have an electric blanket.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.300
Your body's like a heat sponge.

11:26.367 --> 11:29.567
You'll suck up all the heat,
and I'll get up a frozen fish stick.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.066
Don't be ridiculous.
Just turn up the heat.

11:33.133 --> 11:36.600
It's already on 9.
On 10 you can cook a Lean cuisine.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.166
Good night, Ma.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.333
Girls, girls.
Could I share your electric blanket?

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
-No.
-No.

11:44.467 --> 11:46.033
I can't sleep.

11:46.100 --> 11:49.700
My bed's never been so cold,
especially on a Saturday night.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.400
Oh, all right. Get in.

11:54.033 --> 11:56.233
Brr. Oh!

11:58.000 --> 11:59.200
Listen. Did you hear that sound?

11:59.734 --> 12:02.834
I'm in my own bed,
and I'll do what I want.

12:20.867 --> 12:23.467
It sounded like the heat kicking on.

12:23.834 --> 12:25.834
Thank God. Get back to your own beds.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.500
-Hi, everybody.
-What are you doing?

12:28.567 --> 12:32.800
-Tinkering with the heater.
-Rose, you're a genius.

12:32.867 --> 12:35.600
That's a sentence
you don't hear every day.

12:37.133 --> 12:40.300
There's one little problem.

12:40.367 --> 12:44.200
I turned the air conditioner on
instead of the heater. It won't go off.

12:44.266 --> 12:48.066
Now it'll be colder inside
than it is outside.

12:48.133 --> 12:49.266
You're right.

12:49.333 --> 12:52.333
There's an icicle
on the nose of my bunny slippers.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.033
-Move over.
-Ow.

12:54.100 --> 13:00.600
Oh.

13:01.467 --> 13:05.200
-There. That's not so bad.
-Get your bunny nose out of my butt.

13:08.734 --> 13:12.000
-Let's just get some sleep.
-Good night, Ma.

13:12.066 --> 13:14.400
Good night, Moe. Good night, Larry.

13:18.533 --> 13:22.500
I can't sleep.
I'm on the wrong side of the bed.

13:22.567 --> 13:26.166
Well, I usually sleep on the right side.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.166
What the hell
is everyone so particular about?

13:29.233 --> 13:31.467
In Sicily, four in a bed is a treat.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.133
It means half your family
is on vacation.

13:37.934 --> 13:40.633
I slept with my brothers until I was 17.

13:41.133 --> 13:43.934
I was engaged to one
for a short period of time.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.066
But that's a separate story.

13:49.266 --> 13:54.734
-I wouldn't mind hearing it.
-Rose, shut up. Go to sleep.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.300
I have to go to work
early in the morning.

14:00.633 --> 14:03.667
-Oh, darn. I forgot something.
-Go in your pajamas.

14:04.967 --> 14:09.633
No, it's not that.
I forgot to say my prayers.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.500
Rose, God wouldn't mind
if you skipped a night.

14:13.567 --> 14:15.367
He's busy these days.

14:15.433 --> 14:18.500
Most of his free time
is spent talking to Pat Robertson.

14:21.834 --> 14:24.600
Hello, God. It's me, Rose Nylund.

14:25.300 --> 14:29.533
I'm sorry to be getting in touch so late.
I hope I didn't wake you.

14:30.266 --> 14:34.467
-Oh, God.
-One at a time, Blanche.

14:37.166 --> 14:42.633
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I think you're still doing a terrific job.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.767
Course, there are some things
I don't understand.

14:46.033 --> 14:47.233
Like poverty...

14:48.333 --> 14:51.333
and the spokes model
category on <i>Star Search.</i>

14:53.000 --> 14:56.633
But then again,
you work your wonders in mysterious ways.

14:57.600 --> 15:02.900
A couple of years ago I would've frozen
to death 'cause I was by myself.

15:03.300 --> 15:07.633
Now, I have Dorothy, Blanche and Sophia
to keep me warm.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.900
Not just on a cold winter's night,
but all year long.

15:12.867 --> 15:14.467
Take care of them, God.

15:14.767 --> 15:17.000
-If anything happened, I just--
-(Dorothy in deep voice) Rose,

15:17.066 --> 15:20.133
thanks for the lovely prayer.

15:25.834 --> 15:29.900
Now shut up and get into bed.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.667
Amen.

15:37.934 --> 15:39.533
Nice work, Dorothy.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.100
It wasn't me.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.934
Sweet Jesus, am I in trouble.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.600
Now I lay me down to sleep...

16:01.400 --> 16:05.033
(serene music playing)

16:05.700 --> 16:09.667
I love you all, but Phil needs me.

16:10.033 --> 16:12.667
You said Phil and his wife
were getting along better.

16:12.734 --> 16:14.667
They were never right for each other.

16:14.734 --> 16:17.834
She never appreciated him,
never encouraged him.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.533
With the right woman behind him,
he could've had a real diamond

16:21.600 --> 16:22.867
in his front tooth.

16:28.734 --> 16:30.734
You always stick up for him.

16:31.033 --> 16:35.100
The fact is, he's always chosen
the wrong women.

16:35.166 --> 16:38.967
You've always made the right choices
when it came to relationships?

16:39.367 --> 16:43.667
Need I remind you of the yutz parade
that's been through this house?

16:46.200 --> 16:49.934
Sophia, be fair. At our age,
it's not easy to find the perfect man.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.500
Maybe we've all dated our share of losers,
but I've had my share of winners, too.

16:55.567 --> 16:58.633
Please. You've ridden more winners
than Willie Shoemaker.

17:04.333 --> 17:08.600
I meant there's been a variety of men
in our lives.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.734
Thanks for the ride. I'll see you
at Tuesday's jazzercise class.

17:12.800 --> 17:18.066
Unless I see you before then.
Maybe we could go out.

17:18.133 --> 17:21.533
Did I hear you ask me for a date?

17:21.600 --> 17:23.533
Are you deaf? I heard him from here.

17:25.633 --> 17:29.000
So, Blanche, maybe we could have dinner
Saturday night?

17:29.066 --> 17:33.800
-I'll check my datebook and let you know.
-I'll call you tomorrow.

17:33.867 --> 17:35.900
-Ok, bye.
-Bye.

17:38.033 --> 17:40.967
Isn't this an interesting turn of events?

17:41.734 --> 17:43.667
I don't know what I'm going to do.

17:44.133 --> 17:46.166
He is a little younger than I am.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.233
You know what I think?

17:51.633 --> 17:55.133
I can handle this relationship.
I'm going out with Dirk.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.934
Was there ever any doubt?

17:58.033 --> 18:01.166
Momentarily. This is
strictly off-the-record...

18:01.567 --> 18:03.834
but Dirk's nearly five years younger
than I am.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.233
In what, Blanche, dog years?

18:17.400 --> 18:20.233
I'm Blanche, Dorothy's roommate.
Would you get the door?

18:23.266 --> 18:24.734
Dorothy's told me a great deal about you.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.333
She seems to have omitted
one itty-bitty detail about you.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.900
-That I'm a priest.
-Uh-huh.

18:31.834 --> 18:33.233
She didn't know.

18:34.266 --> 18:36.133
What did she think,
you were a boring dresser?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.433
She's never seen me in cleric's clothing.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.100
I didn't know priests
could take your clothes off.

18:46.600 --> 18:51.500
-We do a lot of things real people do.
-Except for one very important thing.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.967
Boy, will that put a hitch
in Dorothy's plans.

18:59.533 --> 19:03.000
Hello. I'm Rose Nylund.
You must be Frank.

19:03.066 --> 19:05.033
It's a pleasure to meet you.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.900
Thank you, Rose.
It's very nice to meet you.

19:06.967 --> 19:10.033
-Dorothy has talked about you for weeks.
-Rose.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.700
Whenever she mentions your name,
she glows.

19:12.767 --> 19:15.100
-Rose.
-She's smitten with you.

19:15.166 --> 19:16.367
Rose!

19:17.367 --> 19:19.100
-He's a priest, isn't he?
-Yes, Rose.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.367
I'm so sorry <i>Hell Town </i>was canceled.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.100
Frank, I'm sorry I...

19:38.066 --> 19:40.066
please tell me that's a Nehru jacket.

19:42.367 --> 19:45.300
-No, it's not.
-Rose, let's go heat up the lasagna.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.400
Come on. Come on.

19:51.533 --> 19:54.033
Why didn't you tell me
it was "father" Leahy?

19:54.100 --> 19:56.667
-I assumed you knew.
-No, I didn't.

19:57.266 --> 19:59.667
And frankly I'm...

20:00.367 --> 20:03.133
-I'm a little embarrassed.
-Yeah, well, me, too.

20:04.533 --> 20:07.233
What difference does it make?
We can still be friends, can't we?

20:07.734 --> 20:09.367
Oh, of course we can.

20:09.700 --> 20:10.900
I'm glad you're here.

20:11.467 --> 20:12.967
Yeah, well, so am I.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.967
You look lovely tonight.

20:19.033 --> 20:21.734
I look like the mother
of a Solid Gold Dancer.

20:25.400 --> 20:32.066
Girls, I want to give you my gift next.
I made the same one for each of you.

20:32.133 --> 20:34.166
Here, Sophia.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.667
<i>"The men of Blanche's boudoir."</i>

20:43.000 --> 20:44.633
It's a calendar.

20:46.500 --> 20:50.867
Each month has the picture of a man who's
brought some special joy into my life.

20:52.066 --> 20:55.934
Oh, Blanche.
Oh, honey, this is so thoughtful.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.033
Whoa!

21:02.400 --> 21:04.533
-September?
-Yup.

21:05.433 --> 21:08.000
I'm surprised you could walk in October.

21:13.934 --> 21:18.500
-So, uh, where are you going?
-Out with a friend.

21:18.567 --> 21:21.500
The same friend you've been out with
five times?

21:21.567 --> 21:24.533
-Yes.
-Who is he?

21:24.600 --> 21:28.767
Dr. Jonathan Newman.
He's a psychiatrist at the grief center.

21:28.834 --> 21:32.934
-So, Rose, you're seeing a psychiatrist.
-It's about time.

21:34.567 --> 21:36.800
I'm Dr. Jonathan Newman.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.567
Are you absolutely sure?

21:43.233 --> 21:44.967
Yes. May I come in?

21:45.033 --> 21:47.967
Please, please, please. Come right in.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.734
May I take your height... hat!

21:52.834 --> 21:55.900
You must be Dorothy.
Rose has told me all about you.

21:56.734 --> 21:59.300
I wish I could say the same.

22:01.633 --> 22:05.767
Oh, Blanche, Blanche.
This is Dr. Jonathan Newman.

22:07.533 --> 22:08.900
Get out of here.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.934
Blanche.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.333
-But, Dorothy, he's a--
-A little early.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.000
But we're delighted to see him.

22:19.033 --> 22:22.533
-Hi, Jonathan.
-Hello, Rose. You're looking lovely.

22:22.600 --> 22:27.133
Oh, wait a minute.
Rose Nylund, you devil, you.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.800
I just figured out what's going on.

22:29.867 --> 22:30.967
Blanche.

22:32.533 --> 22:35.567
You're sore at me for inviting your friend
without asking you,

22:35.633 --> 22:38.367
so you hired this guy
to teach me a lesson.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.700
God, I wish I was dead.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.066
Blanche, let's go get the hors d'oeuvre.
Excuse us.

22:57.800 --> 23:03.166
I've never been so embarrassed.
I made a fool of myself, didn't I?

23:03.233 --> 23:04.266
Yes.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.467
I feel awful. Just awful!

23:06.533 --> 23:10.900
If you don't want tonight
to turn into a total disaster,

23:10.967 --> 23:13.834
you have to stop being so self-conscious.

23:13.900 --> 23:16.200
You're right, of course.

23:16.500 --> 23:20.934
Dr. Newman is a guest in our home. If I'm
self-conscious, he'll be ill at ease.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.900
I can't allow that to happen.
It would be unsouthern.

23:26.667 --> 23:28.867
That's a good belle.

23:28.934 --> 23:31.567
Dorothy, get the door.

23:36.967 --> 23:38.300
Shrimp?

23:42.967 --> 23:46.266
Isn't there anything we can do
to convince you to stay?

23:46.734 --> 23:48.900
My mind's made up.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.633
My baby needs me.

23:51.233 --> 23:55.934
-What about me, Ma?
-You can make it. You don't need me.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.767
What about me?

23:57.834 --> 24:01.867
You were strong and independent
before I arrived. You don't need me.

24:01.934 --> 24:03.467
What about me?

24:03.533 --> 24:05.400
You, you need <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.

24:09.834 --> 24:11.100
I'm going to pack.

24:11.166 --> 24:15.900
-Can't we do anything to make you stay?
-My mind's made up.

24:15.967 --> 24:17.200
I'm leaving in the morning.

24:18.133 --> 24:19.400
Oh.

24:25.934 --> 24:31.266
(theme music playing)
