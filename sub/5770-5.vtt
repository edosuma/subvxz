00:04.134 --> 00:06.919
HEY.
HEY, SLEEPYHEAD.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.443
JOSH?
HMM?

00:08.486 --> 00:10.053
JOSH.
NO.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.359
DUDE, WAKE UP.
WHAT?

00:11.402 --> 00:13.230
HEY.
OH, HEY.

00:13.274 --> 00:14.405
I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOTHING.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.233
IT'S JUST THAT I GOT COLD,

00:16.277 --> 00:17.408
SO I PUT ON YOUR BUTTON-DOWN,

00:17.452 --> 00:19.149
BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN
FIT ME RIGHT,

00:19.193 --> 00:20.411
'CAUSE I'M JUST A GIRL.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.673
NO, THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS
REALLY GOOD ON YOU.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.936
COME ON, NO. YEAH.

00:23.980 --> 00:24.981
YEAH, YOU LOOK LIKE
DREW BARRYMORE

00:25.025 --> 00:26.287
IN ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
I HATE.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.723
NO, I DON'T.
COME HERE.
BACK IN BED.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.551
YOU HAVE WORK.
BACK IN BED.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.335
OKAY.
I HAVE AN IDEA.

00:31.379 --> 00:34.512
HOW ABOUT WE BOTH
PLAY HOOKY TODAY?

00:34.556 --> 00:36.340
OKAY, CAN MAYBE DO THAT.
MM-HMM.
YEAH?

00:36.384 --> 00:37.341
HOW DOES THIS SOUND?

00:37.385 --> 00:38.864
I'LL GO OUT,

00:38.908 --> 00:40.301
GET US SOME COFFEE AND
CROISSANTS...
MM-HMM.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.867
AND WHEN I GET BACK,

00:41.911 --> 00:43.260
THAT SHIRT BETTER BE BACK
ON THE FLOOR.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.219
OKAY.
OKAY.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.525
WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING,
JOSH?

00:47.569 --> 00:49.527
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.312
THIS IS BAD.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.662
YOU ARE A BAD INFLUENCE ON ME.

00:53.705 --> 00:56.099
THIS IS WEIRD.
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY JEANS?

00:56.143 --> 00:57.405
OH, MY GOD.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.450
THE WAIST ALWAYS LIKE THIS?

00:59.494 --> 01:00.756
TAKE THOSE OFF RIGHT NOW.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.062
THIS IS BIZARRE.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.324
THERE'S ALL THESE JOLLY RANCHERS
IN THE POCKET.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.238
YOU ARE WEARING MY JEANS.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.239
PLEASE TAKE THEM OFF
RIGHT NOW.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.588
NO, IT'S FINE.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.024
WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING.NO.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.895
YOU'RE WEARING MY SHIRT,
I'M WEARING YOUR JEANS.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.636
NO, NO, IT IS NOT THE SAME.
OKAY?

01:11.680 --> 01:12.942
THIS IS ADORABLE.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.509
THAT IS LIKE A LAP-BAND SURGERY AD.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.119
LOT OF ROOM
IN THE BACK.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.425
OH, MY GOD, JOSH!

01:17.468 --> 01:18.469
HEY, WHAT KIND OF COFFEE
DO YOU WANT?

01:18.513 --> 01:19.601
I DON'T WANT COFFEE!

01:19.644 --> 01:20.732
I WANT YOU TO GO TO WORK,

01:20.776 --> 01:21.907
AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE

01:21.951 --> 01:22.908
YOUR DAMN SHIRT!

01:22.952 --> 01:25.433
OKAY.
THIS TOOK A TURN.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.565
ARE YOU STILL HERE?
YEAH.
CAN I HAVE MY TIE, PLEASE?

01:27.609 --> 01:29.350
LEAVE YOUR TIE.
I'M GONNA USE IT TO HANG MYSELF.

01:29.393 --> 01:32.353
[upbeat dance music]

01:32.396 --> 01:38.402
[vocalizing]

01:38.446 --> 01:42.145
â™ª

01:49.196 --> 01:50.458
I KNOW YOU SAID
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW

01:50.501 --> 01:52.416
THE SEX OF YOUR BABY,
BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU,

01:52.460 --> 01:54.026
[whispering]
IT'S THE GOOD ONE.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.158
[chuckles]

01:55.202 --> 01:56.159
BYE, COURTNEY.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.726
DID YOU RECEIVE
MY TEXTS?

01:57.769 --> 01:59.467
I DON'T NEED TO READ YOUR
PATHETIC "TAKE ME BACK" TEXTS.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.773
I'M SORRY THAT I HAUNT YOU.
JUST PLEASE MOVE ON.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.471
YEAH, I WOULD LIKE
TO MOVE ON, MINDY,

02:03.514 --> 02:05.212
PREFERABLY WITH
THE BULGARI WRISTWATCH

02:05.255 --> 02:06.909
THAT I LEFT IN YOUR APARTMENT
THE LAST TIME WE--YOU KNOW.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.432
THE LAST TIME
I ACCIDENTALLY ALLOWED YOU

02:08.476 --> 02:09.433
TO LET ME
ROCK YOUR WORLD?[sighs]

02:09.477 --> 02:12.001
YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE SEEN
THE WATCH.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.570
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN DR. SHULMAN'S OFFICE?

02:15.613 --> 02:17.224
HEY.
JUST WORKING.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.312
WHY DON'T YOU WORK
IN YOUR OWN OFFICE?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.444
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THESE DAYS,

02:20.488 --> 02:21.576
DR. SHULMAN'S
GOING TO RETIRE,

02:21.619 --> 02:22.925
SO SOMETIMES
I LIKE TO COME IN HERE

02:22.968 --> 02:24.448
AND GET A FEEL
OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE

02:24.492 --> 02:25.754
WHEN I'M IN CHARGE.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.799
OKAY, IF WE ARE INDULGING
IMAGINARY SITUATIONS,

02:27.843 --> 02:30.062
I WOULD LOVE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY HUSBAND,

02:30.106 --> 02:31.281
STRAIGHT ANDERSON COOPER.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.065
YOU KNOW, I CAN IMAGINE THAT
QUITE VIVIDLY.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.372
I THINK THE TWO OF YOU WOULD
HAVE AN AMAZING CHEMISTRY.THANK YOU.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.331
NOW CAN I PLEASE HAVE
MY WATCH BACK?NO.

02:37.374 --> 02:39.637
MINDY, THE ANGER I FEEL
AT THE LOSS OF MY WATCH

02:39.681 --> 02:41.335
IS EXCEEDED
ONLY BY MY GRIEF.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.597
I'M IN MOURNING. LOOK, GUYS.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.033
ALL THIS--

02:44.076 --> 02:46.427
THIS UNDER THE CASTELLANO REGIME
WON'T BE TOLERATED.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.603
THIS IS TWO COLLEAGUES TRYING
TO SORT OUT A PERSONAL ISSUE--

02:48.646 --> 02:50.213
EXACTLY.
WHO CARES?

02:50.257 --> 02:51.388
JUST GO WORK IT OUT
IN YOUR OWN TIME.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.261
WELL,
UNDER THE LAHIRI REGIME,

02:54.304 --> 02:55.479
ALL VOICES
WILL BE HEARD.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.046
DR. LAHIRI?NOT NOW, BETSY.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.308
PART OF THE REASON--

02:58.352 --> 02:59.614
DR. PENNEY CALLED
ABOUT YOUR APPOINTMENT.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.746
OH, GOD, YEAH.
CAN YOU PLEASE RESCHEDULE IT?

03:01.790 --> 03:03.922
THAT'S THE THING.
YOU'VE RESCHEDULED FIVE TIMES.

03:03.966 --> 03:06.360
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU,
HE RETIRED TWO MONTHS AGO.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.491
[Danny] THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.450
A GYNECOLOGIST
THAT CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER

03:09.493 --> 03:10.842
TO GO SEE
HER GYNECOLOGIST.

03:10.886 --> 03:13.367
I'M GOING TO ASK DR. SHULMAN
TO BE MY GYNECOLOGIST

03:13.410 --> 03:14.411
BECAUSE I'M KIND OF
HIS PROTEGE.

03:14.455 --> 03:15.847
IN YOUR DREAMS.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.371
MAYBE WHEN I'M IN CHARGE,
YOU CAN BE MY PROTEGE.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.546
WELL, NOW GIVE HER
A BREAK.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.287
I MEAN, SHE HAS
A LONG LINE OF VIRTUES--

03:20.330 --> 03:22.071
CHIEF AMONG WHICH,
FORGIVENESS.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.725
HEY, MAN,
YOU WERE MEAN TO ME,

03:23.768 --> 03:25.292
AND I'M NEVER GOING
TO GIVE YOU BACK YOUR WATCH.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.251
I DO NOT APPRECIATE HOW
I'VE BEEN TREATED IN THIS ROOM.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.732
NEITHER OF YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.473
I'M A BETTER DOCTOR
THAN THE LOT OF YOU.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.691
THAT GUY CRACKS ME UP.

03:33.735 --> 03:34.779
VERY THEATRICAL.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.304
MORGAN, HI.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.349
NOW I KNOW
WE'VE ONLY JUST MET,

03:39.393 --> 03:41.525
BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY FASCINATED
BY YOUR BIOGRAPHY.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.570
I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE.

03:42.613 --> 03:45.747
I WAS BORN
IN ROCKAWAY HOSPITAL.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.228
THEY TOOK ME OUT LITTLE-CAESARS
STYLE--THROUGH THE GUTS.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.360
SKIPPING FORWARD A BIT, UM,

03:50.404 --> 03:52.536
I'M PARTICULARLY INTRIGUED
BY YOUR BACKGROUND

03:52.580 --> 03:53.711
AS A REFORMED CRIMINAL.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.278
DID YOU EVER LEARN TO,

03:55.322 --> 03:57.106
SAY, PICK LOCKS?

03:57.149 --> 03:58.325
THAT WAS MY SPECIALTY.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.892
THEY USED TO CALL ME
THE LOCK-NESS MORGAN,

04:00.936 --> 04:03.155
MOSTLY BECAUSE I WOULD SHOW UP
BLURRY IN PHOTOGRAPHS.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.375
BUT I DON'T DO CRIMES
NO MORE.

04:05.419 --> 04:08.291
OH.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.379
WHAT A SHAME.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.381
IT'S JUST
I WAS HOPING

04:11.425 --> 04:12.861
ON SLIPPING
INTO MINDY'S APARTMENT

04:12.904 --> 04:15.298
WHILE SHE'S HERE AT WORK
AND DECORATING IT

04:15.342 --> 04:18.170
FOR A LITTLE SURPRISE PARTY
FOR HER...

04:18.214 --> 04:21.043
HALF BIRTHDAY.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.262
I LOVE HALF BIRTHDAYS.

04:22.305 --> 04:26.178
AH, I'M IN.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.442
[phone rings]

04:28.485 --> 04:30.270
DANNY.
DANNY, DANNY.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.532
CAN YOU COME HERE FOR A SECOND? WHAT'S UP?

04:31.575 --> 04:33.273
I CAN'T TELL YOU FROM OUT THERE.
CAN YOU COME--

04:33.316 --> 04:34.622
CAN YOU COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER? I'M COMING IN, YEAH.

04:34.665 --> 04:37.668
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS HOMEMADE RETIREMENT CARD

04:37.712 --> 04:39.322
THAT I MADE FOR DR. PENNEY?
BE HONEST.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.063
TAKE THE SUNGLASSES
OFF THE SUN--

04:41.106 --> 04:42.325
MAKES NO SENSE.
THE SUN'S THE ONLY THING

04:42.369 --> 04:43.370
THAT NEVER
NEEDS SUNGLASSES.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.373
UM, THE SUNGLASSES
ARE THE BEST PART.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.375
THAT IS HOW YOU KNOW
THAT THE SUN IS COOL.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.550
OKAY, WHAT ARE WE
DOING HERE?

04:49.593 --> 04:50.420
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
SOMETHING INTERESTING?

04:50.464 --> 04:51.682
SURE.YOU CAN SIT DOWN.

04:51.726 --> 04:52.944
NO, I'M GOOD. JUST TALKING TO DR. SHULMAN.

04:52.988 --> 04:55.295
HE SAYS THAT HE CAN'T
TAKE ME ON AS A PATIENT

04:55.338 --> 04:57.253
'CAUSE, GET THIS--
TOO CLOSE TO ME.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.733
[chuckles]HE JUST LIKES ME
TOO MUCH,

04:58.776 --> 05:00.778
SO I NOW NEED TO FIND
A GYNECOLOGIST

05:00.822 --> 05:02.693
WITH WHOM I DON'T HAVE
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

05:02.737 --> 05:03.999
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ONE.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.522
WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

05:05.566 --> 05:07.263
YOU AND I DON'T HAVE
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.047
YEAH, WE DO.
WE JUST COLLABORATED

05:09.091 --> 05:10.353
ON THIS AWESOME CARD,
AND WE SHARE AN OFFICE.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.876
I SHARE AN OFFICE
WITH LOTS OF THINGS.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.225
YOU, THAT LAMP.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.271
I'M LIKE THE LAMP?I'LL PUT IT THIS WAY:

05:15.315 --> 05:17.317
I HAVE THE SAME
PERSONAL ATTACHMENT TO YOU BOTH.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.407
THE LAMP PROVIDES LIGHT
TO THAT PART OF THE ROOM.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.278
YOU DO WHAT YOU DO.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.368
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT
YOU COULD BE MY GYNECOLOGIST.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.283
NAH, IT WOULD
NEVER WORK.

05:32.462 --> 05:35.291
[Mindy] WHY WOULDN'T IT WORK?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.379
FINISH THE CARD?

05:36.423 --> 05:37.380
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.687
IF I'M LIKE A LAMP
TO YOU,

05:39.730 --> 05:41.079
HOW COME YOU COULDN'T BE
MY GYNECOLOGIST?

05:41.123 --> 05:42.342
I COULD BE
YOUR GYNECOLOGIST.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.473
I'M SAYING YOU COULDN'T
BE MY PATIENT.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.692
AND WHY IS THAT?

05:44.735 --> 05:46.389
COME ON.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.652
NO, WHY?

05:48.696 --> 05:50.132
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A CERTAIN--

05:50.175 --> 05:52.090
YOU KNOW, LOOK,
IT'S HUMAN.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.919
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

05:54.963 --> 05:57.400
I SEE HOW YOU LOOK AT ME
WHEN I'M IN A T-SHIRT.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.184
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

05:59.228 --> 06:00.969
YOU ARE
SUCH A NARCISSIST!

06:01.012 --> 06:02.536
YOU THINK I'M INTERESTED
IN YOUR WEIRD BODY?

06:02.579 --> 06:05.016
I DO. I THINK YOU HARBOR
SOME VERY PERSONAL,

06:05.060 --> 06:06.496
UN-LAMP-LIKE FEELINGS
FOR ME.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.280
I THINK, IN FACT,
THAT YOU HARBOR

06:08.324 --> 06:09.543
UN-LAMP-LIKE FEELINGS
TOWARDS ME.

06:09.586 --> 06:10.674
NOT THE CASE.

06:10.718 --> 06:11.632
AND YOU COULDN'T HANDLE
BEING MY DOCTOR.

06:11.675 --> 06:12.937
NOT THE CASE.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.461
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

06:14.504 --> 06:17.202
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU HAVE A NEW PATIENT.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.552
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.771
YOU NOW HAVE THE BEST OB-GYN
IN THIS PRACTICE.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.599
GREAT DAY FOR BOTH OF US.YEAH.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.427
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO MAKE IT
THROUGH THE CONSULTATION, BUDDY.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.169
ALL RIGHT? WEAR YOUR
TIGHTEST T-SHIRT, MR. GORGEOUS,

06:27.212 --> 06:29.127
AND DON'T CHECK ME OUT
AS I WALK AWAY.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.267
DR. REED,
SWEET BURGLAR CLOTHES.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.442
MORGAN.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.923
I GOT
MY BREAK-IN TOOLS.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.012
I GOT A PICK,
SCREWDRIVER,

06:44.055 --> 06:46.884
A NICE, JUICY T-BONE STEAK
TO DISTRACT ANY GUARD DOGS.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.017
RIGHT?[elevator door dings]

06:49.060 --> 06:52.107
WAIT, WAIT, DR. REED! WAIT!
NO, DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT ME!

06:52.150 --> 06:53.325
WHOA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:53.369 --> 06:55.110
HOW DOES SHE KNOW
ABOUT THE SURPRISE?

06:55.153 --> 06:57.112
I INVITED HER TO HELP
DECORATE DR. LAHIRI'S PLACE.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.156
UGH.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.854
ANY KIND OF PARTY THEME,
I'M READY.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.812
"UNDER THE SEA,"
"NEW YORK, NEW YORK,"

07:01.856 --> 07:05.381
BASEBALL CAP,
CELL PHONE CASE, CAR KEYS...

07:05.425 --> 07:07.165
THIS MIGHT BE
THE LOST AND FOUND BOX.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.909
I LIKE TO ASK
ALL MY NEW PATIENTS

07:11.953 --> 07:14.085
SOME LIFESTYLE QUESTIONS TO
LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR HEALTH.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.391
GO FOR IT.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.566
AND REMEMBER,
YOU CAN STOP THIS AT ANY POINT

07:16.610 --> 07:17.785
IF YOU BEGIN
TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.308
HEY, SO CAN YOU.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.744
[chuckles]

07:20.788 --> 07:22.093
WHEN DID YOU FIRST
START MENSTRUATING?

07:22.137 --> 07:24.531
14, AT A SLEEPOVER.
BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

07:24.574 --> 07:28.012
WHAT WAS THE DATE OF THE FIRST
DAY OF YOUR LAST PERIOD?

07:28.056 --> 07:30.145
11 DAYS AGO,
JUST WHEN I WANTED IT TO.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.626
THAT'S GREAT.
GOOD FOR YOU.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.497
AND WHAT'S YOUR TYPICAL
AMOUNT OF FLOW?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.805
UM...

07:37.848 --> 07:38.936
HEAVY ON THE FIRST DAY,

07:38.980 --> 07:40.242
AND THEN KIND OF
PETERS OUT BY DAY FOUR.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.286
ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

07:41.330 --> 07:42.287
HA HA.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.550
ARE YOU?ARE YOU?

07:43.593 --> 07:44.638
ARE YOU?ARE YOU?

07:44.681 --> 07:46.030
ARE YOU?ARE YOU?

07:46.074 --> 07:47.467
ARE YOU?WHAT DO YOU THINK,
DANNY?

07:47.510 --> 07:48.729
YEAH, I'M SEXUALLY ACTIVE,
OKAY?

07:48.772 --> 07:50.078
I'D PREFER IF YOU CALL ME
DR. CASTELLANO.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.645
I'D PREFER THAT. SORRY, DR. CASTELLANO.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.211
TERRIFIC.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.952
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE?

07:54.996 --> 07:56.258
NO, UM, UM, JUST WRITE,

07:56.301 --> 07:58.042
"THE LAST TIME
THAT THE MOMENT WAS RIGHT..."

07:58.086 --> 08:00.001
"THE LAST TIME
THAT THE MOMENT WAS RIGHT."

08:00.044 --> 08:02.307
"WITH SOMEONE I CARED ABOUT,
AND FEELINGS WERE MUTUAL."

08:02.351 --> 08:04.309
OKAY, I'M NOT WRITING
ALL THAT, BUT--

08:04.353 --> 08:05.310
"A WHILE AGO."

08:05.354 --> 08:06.311
DO YOU USE CONTRACEPTION?

08:06.355 --> 08:08.357
[laughing]
YEAH, CONDOMS.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.532
BUT UGH,
AM I RIGHT?

08:09.576 --> 08:11.186
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DOES "UGH" MEAN?

08:11.229 --> 08:15.103
WELL, CONDOM ETIQUETTE,
IT'S HARD FOR WOMEN, YOU KNOW?

08:15.146 --> 08:16.408
'CAUSE YOU WANT
TO HAVE CONDOMS,

08:16.452 --> 08:17.409
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM
BY THE BED

08:17.453 --> 08:18.454
'CAUSE THEN IT SEEMS LIKE

08:18.498 --> 08:19.455
YOU'RE, LIKE,
USING THEM CONSTANTLY,

08:19.499 --> 08:21.544
BUT YOU CAN'T NOT HAVE THEM,

08:21.588 --> 08:23.111
SO YOU DO, LIKE,
THAT WHOLE DANCE.

08:23.154 --> 08:26.331
LIKE, "OH, HEY, I THINK
I MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE SOMEWHERE,

08:26.375 --> 08:28.203
"FROM, LIKE, A BACHELORETTE
PARTY, LIKE, I HAD AS A GOOF,"

08:28.246 --> 08:30.118
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK A COUPLE WRONG PLACES

08:30.161 --> 08:31.249
BEFORE YOU FINALLY,
LIKE, "FIND" THEM,

08:31.293 --> 08:32.947
[chuckles] JUST TO SEEM,
LIKE, LADYLIKE,

08:32.990 --> 08:34.383
WHEN YOU HAD THEM
THE WHOLE TIME.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.994
YOU NEVER HAD
THAT EXPERIENCE?NEVER.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.039
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE

08:38.082 --> 08:39.736
THE NATURE
OF YOUR SEXUAL ACTIVITY?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.216
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

08:41.259 --> 08:42.870
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU HAVE SEX?

08:42.913 --> 08:44.088
IS THAT ON THE SHEET?

08:44.132 --> 08:45.394
WE COULD STOP.
YOU WANT TO STOP?

08:45.437 --> 08:46.961
NO, I'M HAVING
A GREAT TIME.

08:47.004 --> 08:49.137
GREAT. THANKS SO MUCH.
NEXT QUESTION.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.313
[grunts]
WE'RE IN.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.401
EXCELLENT WORK,
MORGAN.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.055
THANK YOU.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.231
NO GUARD DOG?
THAT'S A WASTE OF A STEAK.

08:56.274 --> 08:57.406
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, GET IN.

08:57.449 --> 08:58.538
WHOA.

08:58.581 --> 09:01.149
IT'S EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I IMAGINED.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.585
IT'S PRETTY COOL
SHE CAN AFFORD THIS PLACE

09:02.629 --> 09:03.717
ON A WOMAN'S SALARY.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.588
OKAY,
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.416
MINDY IS A FLASHY,

09:07.459 --> 09:09.461
YET SOPHISTICATED,
COSMOPOLITAN WOMAN.

09:09.505 --> 09:12.856
WITH THAT IN MIND,
WHERE SHOULD WE HANG THE PINATA?

09:12.900 --> 09:13.857
ABOVE THE STOVE.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.294
NO.
NOBODY TOUCH ANYTHING.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.339
WE'RE NOT HERE TO DECORATE.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.080
I'M LOOKING
FOR MY WATCH.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.603
BUT WHAT ABOUT
MINDY'S HALF BIRTHDAY?

09:20.647 --> 09:23.650
IT WAS A FICTION,
AND I, ITS AUTHOR.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.956
IF YOU TWO TAKE ANYTHING
FROM THIS EXPERIENCE,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.568
TAKE THIS:
QUESTION EVERYTHING.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.482
SO NOT ONLY
DID I GET TRICKED

09:30.526 --> 09:32.615
INTO BREAKING INTO
MY BEST FRIEND'S APARTMENT,

09:32.659 --> 09:34.182
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THERE'S NO PARTY?

09:34.225 --> 09:35.662
I GOT PRIORS!

09:35.705 --> 09:38.403
THIS RIGHT HERE,
THIS IS STRIKE TWO FOR ME.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.275
I COULD SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE IN JAIL

09:40.318 --> 09:41.668
IF I SO MUCH
AS KILL SOMEONE.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.279
I'M OUT.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.325
DO YOU EXERCISE
OR PLAY SPORTS?

09:47.369 --> 09:49.545
I DO THE ELLIPTICAL,
45 MINUTES, FOUR TIMES A WEEK.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.635
30 MINUTES,
THREE TIMES A WEEK.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.291
THERE IS A CLUSTER OF
ELLIPTICAL MACHINES AT MY GYM.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.120
I AM PLANNING ON JOINING A GYM
NEAR MY HOUSE, OKAY?

09:59.163 --> 10:00.556
"SEDENTARY."

10:00.600 --> 10:01.644
THAT'S RUDE.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.037
WHAT MEDICATIONS
DO YOU TAKE?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.342
I WAS TAKING FISH OIL

10:04.386 --> 10:05.692
UNTIL THE BOTTLE
ROLLED BEHIND MY FRIDGE.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.303
"ALMOST TAKES FISH OIL."

10:08.346 --> 10:09.434
I'M VERY HEALTHY.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.522
YOU DRINK?

10:10.566 --> 10:11.567
YEAH,
I HAVE A GLASS OF WINE

10:11.611 --> 10:13.134
EVERY NIGHT AT DINNER,
FOR MY HEALTH.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.092
SO BETSY'S
24TH BIRTHDAY PARTY

10:15.136 --> 10:16.616
MUST'VE BEEN THE HEALTHIEST
NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.400
HEY, MAN,
THOSE WERE JAGERBOMBS,

10:18.443 --> 10:19.706
ALL RIGHT? NOT WINE.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.229
SO JOKE'S ON YOU,
"CASTEL-LAME-O."

10:21.272 --> 10:23.013
YOU'RE UPSET. MAYBE
YOU'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE

10:23.057 --> 10:24.362
TALKING
TO ANOTHER DOCTOR, BUT--

10:24.406 --> 10:26.147
NO, I'M FINE. I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY QUESTIONS

10:26.190 --> 10:28.236
ARE ON THIS INSANELY LONG
AND NOSY QUESTIONNAIRE.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.237
THERE'S JUST
ONE MORE PAGE.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.196
OKAY,
EASY-SQUEEZY.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.851
ALL RIGHT.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.200
"DO YOU PLAN ON
HAVING CHILDREN?"

10:36.244 --> 10:37.201
I'M GONNA CHECK
"NO."

10:37.245 --> 10:38.289
WAIT,
WHY WOULD YOU CHECK "NO"?

10:38.333 --> 10:39.943
I DO WANT TO HAVE KIDS, FOUR OF 'EM.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.903
JADEN, MADISON, BRIE,
AND THE LITTLE ONE IS PIPER.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.295
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
WITH THOSE NAMES?

10:44.339 --> 10:45.645
YOU WANT A BUNCH OF GIRLS
WHO WORK AT THE MALL?

10:45.688 --> 10:47.211
MORE LIKE
THEY OWN THE MALL.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.605
BUT YOU AREN'T MARRIED OR EVEN
IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.172
YEAH, BUT WHEN I DO
GET MARRIED,

10:51.215 --> 10:54.001
I'M GONNA STAY MARRIED,
UNLIKE YOU.

10:58.483 --> 11:02.052
OKAY, LET'S DO THE MATH
OF HOW THESE FOUR KIDS

11:02.096 --> 11:03.880
ARE REALISTICALLY
GONNA PLAY OUT.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.839
OKAY.
MATH AWAY, NERD.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.493
SO LET'S SAY YOU SPEND
THE NEXT YEAR OR SO

11:08.537 --> 11:09.973
DATING THIS GUY.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.279
YOU'RE 33 THEN.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.107
YOU SPEND A YEAR
GETTING TO KNOW HIM, 34,

11:13.150 --> 11:14.848
TWO YEARS
LIVING WITH HIM, 35, 36.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.458
FINALLY HE PROPOSES.
YOU GET MARRIED.

11:16.501 --> 11:17.459
CONGRATULATIONS.THANK YOU.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.590
YOU'RE 37.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.244
YOU START TALKING
ABOUT HAVING KIDS,

11:20.288 --> 11:21.506
BUT THE MATERNITY LEAVE
ALONE'S ENOUGH

11:21.550 --> 11:22.812
TO TAKE YOU
OUT OF THE GAME.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.466
YOU SPENT SO LONG
BUILDING YOUR CAREER--38.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.511
NOW YOUR HUSBAND STARTS
RESENTING HOW BUSY YOU ARE.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.252
HE WANTS SOMEONE
WITH MORE FREE TIME,

11:28.296 --> 11:30.602
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP
WORKING, SO HE MOVES OUT.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.995
39.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.302
DIVORCE IS FINALIZED, 40,
BUT YOU'RE NOT WORRIED

11:34.345 --> 11:36.043
BECAUSE 40'S
THE NEW 30, RIGHT?

11:36.086 --> 11:37.740
YOU IMMEDIATELY START DATING
AGAIN, THIS TIME ONLINE.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.437
GOOD NEWS,
YOU FIND A GUY REAL QUICK

11:39.481 --> 11:42.049
AND GET MARRIED AGAIN.
41.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.615
GOT A COUPLE KIDS
ALREADY, THOUGH,

11:43.659 --> 11:45.748
SO IT TAKES SOME TIME
TO CONVINCE HIM.

11:45.792 --> 11:50.274
42, 43, 44.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.320
DO YOU MANAGE TO HAVE ONE KID
UNDER THE BUZZER?

11:52.363 --> 11:55.323
HEY, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

11:58.282 --> 12:01.024
OKAY, NOW THAT WE'RE DONE
WITH THE PAPERWORK,

12:01.068 --> 12:02.243
ARE YOU READY
FOR YOUR EXAM?

12:02.286 --> 12:04.071
ARE YOU?ARE YOU?

12:04.114 --> 12:05.202
ARE YOU?ARE YOU?

12:05.246 --> 12:06.247
ARE YOU?ARE YOU?

12:12.949 --> 12:14.908
DANNY'S RIGHT, IT'S TOO LATE
FOR ME TO HAVE KIDS.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.648
I HAVE NO ONE.

12:16.692 --> 12:19.564
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'RE SAD,
BUT THE FLOOR IS DISGUSTING.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.914
DO YOU KNOW,
WHEN I DIE,

12:20.957 --> 12:23.394
IN MY WILL, I LEAVE
ALL OF MY MONEY TO TINA FEY?

12:23.438 --> 12:25.701
TINA FEY!
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER!

12:25.745 --> 12:27.007
I JUST THINK
THAT SHE WOULD SPEND IT

12:27.050 --> 12:28.530
IN AN INTERESTING
AND RESPONSIBLE WAY.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.358
OH, I HAVE SUCH A GIRL CRUSH
ON TINA FEY.

12:30.401 --> 12:31.881
I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
SAY "GIRL CRUSH."

12:31.925 --> 12:32.882
NO ONE'S GONNA THINK
YOU'RE A LESBIAN

12:32.926 --> 12:34.449
IF YOU JUST SAY "CRUSH."

12:34.492 --> 12:36.799
GWEN, I DON'T WANT ALL
OF MY MONEY TO GO TO TINA FEY.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.540
I WANT IT TO GO
TO MY KIDS AND GRANDKIDS

12:38.583 --> 12:40.498
SO THEY CAN BE
CRAZY SOCIALITES.

12:40.542 --> 12:41.891
LOOK, YOU'VE SPENT YEARS
BUILDING A CAREER.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.893
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF TIME
TO FIGURE THE REST OUT.

12:43.937 --> 12:46.069
YOU'RE NOT 22. SO WHAT?
NO ONE IS.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.724
I THINK PEOPLE
ARE 22.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.334
THIS DANNY GUY, HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.206
NO ONE DOES.
TAKE CARL AND ME--

12:52.249 --> 12:53.207
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW WE MET?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.425
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.557
YOU AND I
MOVED TO THE CITY

12:55.600 --> 12:57.341
TO BE FUN,
SINGLE ROOMMATES TOGETHER,

12:57.385 --> 12:58.865
AND THE FIRST TIME
WE GO OUT, YOU GET HIT ON

12:58.908 --> 13:00.301
BY SOME 37-YEAR-OLD
PEDOPHILE.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.563
OH, HEY,
DON'T CALL HIM THAT!

13:01.606 --> 13:03.739
I'M SORRY, SEXUAL PREDATOR.[sighs]

13:03.783 --> 13:05.132
ANYWAY,
HE BUYS YOU A DRINK,

13:05.175 --> 13:06.568
A YEAR LATER,
I'M MAID OF HONOR

13:06.611 --> 13:08.048
AT THE WORLD'S
STUFFIEST WEDDING,

13:08.091 --> 13:10.485
AND TWO YEARS AFTER THAT,
YOU HAVE SOME RANDOM BABY.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.486
YOUR GODDAUGHTER.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.053
WHOM I HAVE GROWN
TO LOVE.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.489
THANK YOU.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.926
THE POINT IS, WHEN I MET CARL,
I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING,

13:16.970 --> 13:20.277
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS FOR YOU,
YOU WON'T SEE IT COMING EITHER.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.411
GWEN, THAT WAS, LIKE,
CRAZY INSPIRATIONAL.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.369
I DON'T SAY THIS
LIGHTLY:

13:25.413 --> 13:26.980
YOU SHOULD WRITE
MAGAZINE ARTICLES.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.024
[knock, door opens]

13:28.068 --> 13:29.896
HEY, DR. L.,

13:29.939 --> 13:32.289
IF YOU'VE BEEN WONDERING WHERE
I'VE BEEN THE LAST FEW HOURS,

13:32.333 --> 13:33.638
I WAS AT THE MOVIES.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.031
THAT'S MY TICKET,

13:35.075 --> 13:39.079
SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE
BEEN UP TO, ALIBI-WISE.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.602
HEY, MORGAN,
I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU

13:40.645 --> 13:42.125
NOT TO CHECK IN WITH ME
AS MUCH.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.562
WHY ARE YOU
ON THE FLOOR?

13:44.606 --> 13:46.347
DID SOMEONE
KICK YOUR ASS?

13:46.390 --> 13:47.783
EMOTIONALLY, YES.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.699
WELL,
LUCKY FOR YOU,

13:50.742 --> 13:54.355
GUESS WHOSE NUMBER ONE TRAIT
IS "LISTENS GOOD".

13:54.398 --> 13:55.965
ME.

13:56.009 --> 13:56.966
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

13:57.010 --> 13:57.967
GWEN.

13:58.011 --> 14:01.536
"GURN"?
WHAT KIND OF NAME IS THAT?

14:01.579 --> 14:03.799
DR. REED,
STOP THIS RIGHT NOW.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.192
I'M CALLING DR. LAHIRI.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.455
TO TELL HER WHAT, BETSY?
THAT YOU WERE MY ACCOMPLICE?

14:07.498 --> 14:09.196
THAT YOU DRAGGED ME HERE
AGAINST MY WILL

14:09.239 --> 14:11.372
TO RAVISH ME
ON HER OWN BED?

14:11.415 --> 14:12.982
TO EAT HER GUMMY WORMS?
HMM?

14:13.026 --> 14:16.203
I DIDN'T THINK
SHE'D MISS A COUPLE.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.247
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE PEOPLE
AROUND THE OFFICE

14:17.291 --> 14:18.901
THINK YOU'RE A JERK...OH, MY GOD.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.077
BUT WHEN YOU AND DR. LAHIRI
STARTED GOING ON BEDROOM DATES,

14:21.121 --> 14:22.687
I FIGURED THERE HAD TO BE
SOME GOOD IN YOU,

14:22.731 --> 14:25.299
BUT NOW THAT I SEE
THE KIND OF GUY YOU ARE,

14:25.342 --> 14:26.778
I LIKE YOU LESS,

14:26.822 --> 14:30.304
AND THAT MAKES ME LIKE
DR. LAHIRI A LITTLE LESS TOO,

14:30.347 --> 14:32.654
WHICH MAKES ME
NOT LIKE YOU AT ALL!

14:33.960 --> 14:37.311
HERE'S YOUR DUMB WATCH.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.529
I FOUND IT
IN THE NIGHTSTAND

14:38.573 --> 14:40.662
NEXT TO A TUBE OF REALLY
SLIPPERY TOOTHPASTE.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.275
[sighs][door opening, closing]

14:45.319 --> 14:46.668
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

14:46.711 --> 14:47.974
I KNOW.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.323
I MEAN, HE'S TECHNICALLY
YOUR BOSS,

14:49.366 --> 14:50.454
SO I WOULD NOT REPEAT THAT,
BUT THANK YOU.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.673
LISTEN, SIT DOWN.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.980
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU GUYS
SOME PRISON WISDOM.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.156
OKAY?
[sighs]

14:56.199 --> 14:58.636
IF YOU'RE TOO TALL
FOR A BLANKET,

14:58.680 --> 15:01.770
SEW TOGETHER TWO OF THEM.
VOILA, LONG BLANKET.

15:01.813 --> 15:02.945
OKAY, THAT SUCKED.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.033
THAT WAS A BAD ONE.
THAT WAS A BAD ONE.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.340
GIVE ME ONE MORE.
OKAY.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.559
LOOK, WHENEVER
I GOT MY ASS KICKED,

15:08.603 --> 15:10.997
WHETHER IT WAS
MY LITERAL BUTT ASS

15:11.040 --> 15:14.391
OR MY EMOTIONAL HEART ASS,
I DID THE SAME THING.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.524
I GOT BACK OUT THERE,
AND I MADE 'EM REGRET

15:16.567 --> 15:17.873
THEY EVER MESSED WITH ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.309
IS THIS HELPFUL
TO YOU?

15:19.353 --> 15:20.310
I THINK IT'S HEADING
SOMEWHERE HELPFUL.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.790
OKAY.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.445
THINK OF THE BEST, STRONGEST
WARRIOR VERSION OF YOURSELF.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.577
GIVE THAT WARRIOR A NAME.

15:26.621 --> 15:29.363
NEVER TELL IT
TO ANYONE.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.755
MINE IS
AXEHEAD LUNDGREN.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.279
COME ON, MORGAN!

15:32.322 --> 15:33.976
WAIT, KEEP GOING.
THIS IS INTERESTING.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.457
OKAY, OKAY, THEN WHATEVER
HE'S DOING TO THE WARRIOR,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.154
HE'S NOT DOING TO YOU,

15:38.198 --> 15:40.461
SO YOU FIND HIS WEAKNESS,
AND YOU TELL YOUR WARRIOR

15:40.504 --> 15:43.333
TO GO GET HIM.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.987
WOW.

15:45.031 --> 15:48.904
YOU TWO ARE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE
THAT I'VE EVER MET.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.950
I THINK YOU'D ACTUALLY HAVE
PRETTY SMART BABIES.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.342
DID I SENSE
A CHEMISTRY HERE?

15:52.386 --> 15:53.996
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.UH, DEFINITELY NOT.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.128
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
I WAS TALKING.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.217
SHAUNA, WHERE'S BETSY?
HMM?

15:57.260 --> 15:59.784
I SUDDENLY HAVE AN OPENING
IN MY SCHEDULE.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.047
DID DR. LAHIRI FOLD?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.266
IS SHE A VIRGIN?
I KNEW IT.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.138
SHAUNA, I CAN'T COMMENT
ON A PATIENT,

16:05.181 --> 16:06.748
EVEN ONE WHO'S NO LONGER
A PATIENT OF MINE

16:06.791 --> 16:08.924
BECAUSE SHE
COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.491
NOW, I'M GONNA USE
MY FREE HOUR TO WORK OUT.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.275
ONLY AN HOUR,
DANNY?

16:12.319 --> 16:13.711
DON'T YOU NEED
MORE THAN THAT

16:13.755 --> 16:16.018
TO PERFECT ALL THE HOT MUSCLES
ON YOUR GREAT BODY?

16:16.062 --> 16:17.367
THAT HAD THE CADENCE
OF AN INSULT,

16:17.411 --> 16:18.368
BUT IT WAS
A COMPLIMENT.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.456
WHATEVER.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.719
I WILL SEE YOU
IN THE EXAM ROOM.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.069
[laughs]
WHOA.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.817
[deep breath]

16:32.861 --> 16:34.602
HI, MINDY,
HOW ARE YOU?

16:34.645 --> 16:36.038
[slosh]

16:36.082 --> 16:37.822
MY URINE.

16:37.866 --> 16:38.823
THANK YOU.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.347
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:40.390 --> 16:41.565
GREAT WORK.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.915
AND NOW,
LET'S GET YOUR WEIGHT.

16:46.396 --> 16:49.530
UH, YOU'RE IN LUCK,
I WEIGHED MYSELF LAST NIGHT.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.445
YOU CAN JUST WRITE THAT DOWN,
120 POUNDS.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.361
PERFECT.
WE'LL JUST VERIFY THAT.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.015
[taps]

16:56.058 --> 16:57.755
WHY DON'T YOU
HOP RIGHT UP HERE?

17:03.413 --> 17:05.328
DO YOU WANT TO STOP?NO.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.722
JUST TAKING A SECOND.OKAY.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.205
[breathes in sharply]

17:12.248 --> 17:14.076
OH, WE'LL JUST--

17:14.120 --> 17:17.297
GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO ADD
A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGHT.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.342
GOD, YOU ARE
SUCH A JERK.

17:22.389 --> 17:23.520
HOW DO YOU SLEEP
AT NIGHT?

17:23.564 --> 17:26.523
I SLEEP PRETTY GOOD.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.872
NO WONDER
YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU.

17:27.916 --> 17:31.267
HEY, BABE, WE CAN STOP
THIS TRAIN ANYTIME YOU WANT.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.879
[whispering]
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.403
WHAT'S THAT,
MINDY?

17:36.446 --> 17:37.926
[whispering] YOU'RE NOT MINDY,
YOU'RE A WARRIOR,

17:37.969 --> 17:39.232
AND YOUR WARRIOR NAME
IS...

17:39.275 --> 17:40.798
[breathes deeply]

17:40.842 --> 17:43.366
BEYONCE PAD THAI.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.325
KEEP GOING.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.369
ARE YOU SURE?

17:46.413 --> 17:48.545
WEIGH ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

17:51.896 --> 17:53.376
[Jeremy clicks tongue]

17:53.420 --> 17:55.770
[sighs]

17:57.815 --> 17:59.295
DAMN IT!

17:59.339 --> 18:02.298
OH!

18:05.562 --> 18:08.130
GOOD-BYE,
OLD FRIEND.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.089
KEEP TIME.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.101
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR,
DANNY.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.928
YEAH, OKAY.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.452
NO, I MEAN IT.
EVEN WITH ALL OF THIS,

18:25.495 --> 18:26.801
I'M REALLY
LEARNING A LOT.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.325
TOLD YOU I WAS
THE BEST DOCTOR HERE.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.371
WHY DID WANT TO BE AN O.B.?
WERE YOUR PARENTS DOCTORS?

18:31.414 --> 18:32.502
OH, PLEASE.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.374
MY MOM
CLEANED MOTEL ROOMS.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.289
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

18:36.332 --> 18:38.421
[chuckles]
MY DAD?

18:38.465 --> 18:40.815
YOUR GUESS
IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.860
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN 25 YEARS.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.993
WOW, THAT MUST'VE
BEEN HARD.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.256
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GLAD IT WAS HARD.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.302
IF IT WASN'T HARD,
I WOULDN'T BE WHO I AM.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.393
I'M HAPPY THAT YOU FEEL ENOUGH
OF A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

18:53.436 --> 18:54.959
WITH ME THAT YOU
COULD OPEN UP ABOUT THAT.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.266
WHAT?
I DIDN'T--

18:57.310 --> 18:59.355
I DIDN'T OPEN UP TO YOU
ABOUT ANYTHING.

18:59.399 --> 19:03.272
SO I DON'T FEEL A PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP TO YOU, OKAY?

19:03.316 --> 19:07.798
CAN WE JUST--
JUST FINISH THE EXAM?

19:07.842 --> 19:08.799
WHAT'S NEXT?

19:08.843 --> 19:11.454
THE BREAST EXAM,
MY FRIEND.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.065
RIGHT.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.809
[Shauna] DR. REED, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

19:18.853 --> 19:20.463
YOUR PATIENTS
WERE WAITING SO LONG,

19:20.507 --> 19:22.291
SOME OF THEM
ARE IN A NEW TRIMESTER.

19:22.335 --> 19:23.553
I WENT FOR A WALK, SHAUNA,

19:23.597 --> 19:25.338
AND I MUST HAVE
LOST TRACK OF TIME,

19:25.381 --> 19:27.601
BECAUSE YOU SEE,
I STILL DON'T HAVE...

19:27.644 --> 19:30.647
A WATCH.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.216
NO OFFENSE,
BUT THAT EXCUSE STINKS.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.437
I TOLD THEM YOU WERE HELPING
A LITTLE BLACK KID.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.482
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
HUH.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.792
I'VE NEVER HAD A GYNECOLOGIST
EXAMINE MY FACE BEFORE.

19:44.835 --> 19:45.793
I'M JUST BEING THOROUGH.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.098
YEAH?YEAH.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.361
IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH ANY OF THIS,

19:48.404 --> 19:49.449
WE CAN STOP
AT ANY TIME.

19:49.492 --> 19:50.711
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I'M FINE.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.060
YOU SURE?ABSOLUTELY FINE.

19:52.103 --> 19:55.759
OKAY.

19:55.803 --> 19:56.760
MY BREASTS.

19:56.804 --> 19:57.761
YUP.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.503
GO NUTS.

20:00.547 --> 20:01.504
I WILL.

20:01.548 --> 20:04.681
I WILL.
OKAY.

20:04.725 --> 20:08.032
HEY, HEY.
EYES DOWN HERE.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.860
[clicking tongue]

20:09.904 --> 20:10.861
MMM.

20:10.905 --> 20:11.949
SHUT UP, OKAY?

20:11.993 --> 20:13.168
JUST--COME ON, SHUT UP.WHAT? WHAT?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.169
DON'T DO THAT
TO ME.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.736
WHAT AM I DOING?
I'M SORRY.

20:15.779 --> 20:18.782
IT'S JUST, YOU WERE
DOING A GOOD JOB.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.524
DOES EVERYTHING
FEEL NORMAL?

20:21.568 --> 20:23.613
YES, IT FEELS--
IT FEELS FINE.

20:23.657 --> 20:27.095
YOU KNOW, UM,
AFTER YOU FINISH THIS,

20:27.138 --> 20:29.053
WE HAVE THE, UH,
MAIN EVENT.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.577
I CAN'T, OKAY.
OKAY, I--

20:30.620 --> 20:31.578
I-I CAN'T DO THIS.

20:31.621 --> 20:32.709
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.WHY?

20:32.753 --> 20:34.015
I THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT
OF ME AS A LAMP.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.712
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST EXAMINE MY WIRES?

20:35.756 --> 20:37.061
I'M GOING HOME,
OKAY?

20:37.105 --> 20:38.628
I'M GOING HOME.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.416
EVERYONE!
EVERYONE! LISTEN UP!

20:43.459 --> 20:45.505
I AM SORRY TO ANNOUNCE
THAT DANNY CASTELLANO

20:45.548 --> 20:48.247
WAS UNABLE TO FINISH
MY GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM

20:48.290 --> 20:49.639
BECAUSE OF
HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS FOR ME,

20:49.683 --> 20:50.727
WHICH GOT IN THE WAY.

20:50.771 --> 20:53.121
DR. CASTELLANO,
IS THAT TRUE?

20:53.164 --> 20:54.296
I'M NOT COMING IN
TOMORROW.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.429
DANNY! DANNY,
YOU MAY TAKE THE DAY OFF,

20:56.472 --> 20:57.604
BUT OUR FRIENDSHIP
ENDURETH.

20:57.647 --> 20:58.605
TAKING THE WEEK OFF.

20:58.648 --> 20:59.693
SEE YOU, DANNY!

20:59.736 --> 21:01.085
NICE TO KNOW YA!

21:01.129 --> 21:04.088
EVERYONE, WE HAVE A WINNER:
BEYONCE PAD THAI!

21:04.132 --> 21:06.177
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.570
THANKS SO MUCH.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.877
IT WAS DIFFICULT,
BUT I MANAGED TO WIN IN THE END.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.793
HEY, I'M REALIZING THAT I STILL
DON'T HAVE A GYNECOLOGIST.

21:12.836 --> 21:13.968
I KIND OF DROPPED THE BALL
ON THAT ONE.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.275
DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN HELP ME OUT WITH THAT?

21:17.276 --> 21:18.233
YEAH.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.495
PROUD OF YOU, DOG.PEACE.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.323
YOU'RE A BADASS BITCH.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.585
I APPRECIATE THAT.

21:22.629 --> 21:23.499
[Morgan]
WATCH OUT FOR THE WALL.

21:23.543 --> 21:24.500
UH, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT.

21:24.544 --> 21:25.501
RIGHT, RIGHT,
YUP.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.286
UGH!
YUP. YUP.

21:28.722 --> 21:29.679
AWESOME.

21:29.723 --> 21:30.724
GO TO BED.
