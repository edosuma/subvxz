NARRATOR: Tonight,
on the Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.667 --> 00:05.875
-CHARLES: Here it comes.
-RICK: The Garden Shaft project

00:06.042 --> 00:07.042
is finally underway.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.875
BILL:
This way a bit.

00:09.042 --> 00:11.167
GARY:
Time to open Pandora's box.

00:12.042 --> 00:13.917
-ALEX: Oh, boy.
-Wow.
-Wow.

00:14.042 --> 00:15.333
HELEN:
I'll tell you, Jack,

00:15.542 --> 00:17.000
it's the first time
in 40 years of fieldwork

00:17.083 --> 00:18.250
I have seen something
like this...

00:18.417 --> 00:19.583
buried.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.042
They're hiding something.

00:21.208 --> 00:23.125
Ooh, interesting.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.000
Brilliant.

00:31.375 --> 00:34.417
NARRATOR:
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.542 --> 00:37.000
where people
have been looking for

00:37.208 --> 00:41.000
an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.042
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.208 --> 00:46.250
with strange symbols
carved into it...

00:47.375 --> 00:50.417
...man-made workings
that date to medieval times,

00:50.583 --> 00:55.000
and a lead cross
whose origin may be connected

00:55.125 --> 00:56.125
to the Knights Templar.

00:56.292 --> 00:59.000
To date, six men have died

00:59.208 --> 01:01.833
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.958 --> 01:07.000
And according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:07.208 --> 01:09.667
before the treasure
can be found.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.292

ALEX:
All right, guys, D.5N-27.

01:26.708 --> 01:28.333
-Yep.
-We've moved east

01:28.500 --> 01:29.625
of where we last
hit the tunnel,

01:29.750 --> 01:30.833
hoping to intercept it again.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.167
Yep.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.042
NARRATOR:
Another exciting morning

01:34.208 --> 01:36.333
has begun on Oak Island

01:36.500 --> 01:39.125
for brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

01:39.292 --> 01:41.792
and their team
as they continue their quest

01:41.958 --> 01:43.292
to solve a mystery

01:43.500 --> 01:45.000
that has captivated
treasure hunters

01:45.167 --> 01:47.417
for more than two centuries.

01:47.583 --> 01:51.375
This is an attempt to hit
the furthest east extension

01:51.542 --> 01:53.500
of our tunnel,
which in this area

01:53.625 --> 01:55.000
will hit it at
over a hundred feet.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.167
-Yep.
-ALEX: The tunnel that

01:57.292 --> 01:58.500
we are following today

01:58.625 --> 02:00.167
that emanates
from the Garden Shaft,

02:00.333 --> 02:02.417
it could be a conduit
through which the water

02:02.542 --> 02:04.167
with the high metal
concentration is flowing,

02:04.375 --> 02:05.292
bringing it to the Baby Blob.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.000
That's a very good point.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.583
NARRATOR:
Today, the team is drilling

02:09.792 --> 02:11.542
a new borehole
on their strategic grid

02:11.708 --> 02:14.500
known as D5N-27,

02:14.708 --> 02:19.000
located several feet east
of the 82-foot-deep,

02:19.167 --> 02:20.917
mid-18th-century structure

02:21.042 --> 02:22.667
known as the Garden Shaft.

02:22.833 --> 02:26.333
Here, they are hoping
to once again encounter

02:26.542 --> 02:29.375
a mysterious seven-and-a-half-
foot-high tunnel

02:29.542 --> 02:32.167
located some
100 feet underground,

02:32.375 --> 02:34.500
which they have
previously drilled into

02:34.667 --> 02:37.333
numerous times
over the past year.

02:37.458 --> 02:41.125
A tunnel which has yielded
high trace evidence of gold,

02:41.292 --> 02:43.625
and which runs
westward directly below

02:43.792 --> 02:45.167
the Garden Shaft and into

02:45.333 --> 02:46.833
another possible treasure zone

02:47.042 --> 02:50.208
known as "The Baby Blob."

02:51.167 --> 02:53.667
-53.
-TERRY: 53? A broken run. Okay.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.458
STEVE:
Let's pull it down
and I'll drain it.

02:56.917 --> 02:58.208
-Gentlemen.
-Hey, fellas.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.083
-Well, look who's here.
-Morning.

03:00.208 --> 03:01.708
TERRY: Hi, guys.
How are you doing?

03:01.875 --> 03:03.667
Good. What are you finding?

03:03.875 --> 03:05.125
Well, it's...

03:05.292 --> 03:06.917
We're down 53 feet,

03:07.042 --> 03:08.375
and as you can see,

03:08.542 --> 03:10.792
-it's relatively soft.
-CRAIG: Soft? Okay.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.542
TERRY:
It's always been an omen

03:13.708 --> 03:16.083
that we're fairly close
to a structure

03:16.292 --> 03:17.500
when you hit
soft material like this.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.667
We're definitely
close to a tunnel.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.000
Well, I mean,
it's going to be a little bit

03:22.208 --> 03:24.167
before you guys get down
to the 100-foot level.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.458
So, we're gonna go run
and do some stuff.

03:26.625 --> 03:27.833
-Okay.
-But if you get wood...

03:28.042 --> 03:29.000
-Yep.
-...or anything else,

03:29.167 --> 03:30.833
-give us a call.
-Yep, will do.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.500
STEVE:
See you, guys.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.042
This is gonna be
the time we find something.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.042
NARRATOR:
As the core-drilling operation

03:37.208 --> 03:39.250
continues in
the Money Pit area...

03:40.208 --> 03:41.167
-RICK: Hey, guys.
-CRAIG: Hi, guys.

03:41.333 --> 03:42.708
MARTY: Morning.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.000
The Garden Shaft project

03:44.125 --> 03:45.417
is very, very critical this year

03:45.625 --> 03:48.833
and this will certainly
push the search forward.

03:48.958 --> 03:50.250
Agreed.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.792
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina and Craig Tester,

03:52.875 --> 03:56.167
along with operations
manager Scott Barlow,

03:56.375 --> 03:58.208
have gathered in the war room.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.000
Thank you very much, Rick,

04:00.208 --> 04:03.333
for accommodating our request
for the meeting this morning.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.750
NARRATOR:
They are meeting
via videoconference

04:04.917 --> 04:07.625
with Marty Lagina
and representatives

04:07.792 --> 04:10.042
from a mining
and construction company

04:10.208 --> 04:13.500
known as Dumas
Contracting Limited.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.333
RICK:
So, Cameron and Tony,

04:15.500 --> 04:16.625
they asked for this meeting.

04:16.792 --> 04:18.250
I'm hoping this is

04:18.417 --> 04:20.208
the much-anticipated
code of practice

04:20.333 --> 04:23.000
because we've got to get
going on that project.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.667
Right.

04:24.833 --> 04:27.000
NARRATOR:
While the Oak Island team

04:27.125 --> 04:28.333
continues core drilling

04:28.542 --> 04:30.917
in an attempt
to pinpoint new targets

04:31.042 --> 04:32.542
around the Garden Shaft,

04:32.708 --> 04:36.125
Rick, Marty and Craig
are eagerly waiting

04:36.292 --> 04:38.542
for Dumas to have
a code of practice,

04:38.708 --> 04:42.125
or new permit, approved
by the provincial government

04:42.333 --> 04:44.792
to vertically extend
the Garden Shaft

04:44.958 --> 04:46.667
by as much as 20 feet.

04:46.833 --> 04:49.000
This operation
would not only breach

04:49.208 --> 04:50.833
the tunnel running below it,

04:51.042 --> 04:54.333
but also allow the team
to personally explore it

04:54.542 --> 04:57.000
or build a new tunnel,
if necessary,

04:57.208 --> 04:58.833
in order to reach new targets

04:59.042 --> 05:02.292
identified by the current
core-drilling process.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.542
Cameron, I'm going
to turn it over to you.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.500
I hope you have
good news for us.

05:06.708 --> 05:08.583
Uh, we do have
favorable news to report.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.167
Great.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.417
CAMERON:
We did receive notice

05:12.583 --> 05:15.333
from the Ministry of Labor
in Nova Scotia

05:15.542 --> 05:18.792
that our code of practice
has been approved and granted.

05:19.875 --> 05:23.208
It's a culmination of
an awful lot of engineering work

05:23.375 --> 05:24.875
led by Mr. Linton

05:25.083 --> 05:27.833
and his technical team, um,
at the Dumas group.

05:28.042 --> 05:30.333
And the ministry is confident

05:30.500 --> 05:32.667
that we have the right
means and methods

05:32.833 --> 05:35.583
to go forward with the deepening
of the Garden Shaft.

05:35.708 --> 05:37.125
Great.

05:37.292 --> 05:38.250
CAMERON:
Further, we are actively

05:38.375 --> 05:40.083
mobilizing to the island,

05:40.250 --> 05:41.333
and look forward to getting

05:41.500 --> 05:43.583
the shaft deepening
work underway.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.875
Excellent.

05:46.042 --> 05:47.958
That was fabulously
unrelenting good news.

05:48.042 --> 05:49.042
(laughter)

05:49.208 --> 05:50.167
(chuckles)

05:50.333 --> 05:51.333
RICK:
The good news is

05:51.542 --> 05:54.125
the work in the shaft can begin.

05:54.292 --> 05:57.667
We have to take advantage
of this time now,

05:57.833 --> 06:00.917
in terms of the sonic drill
program in the Money Pit,

06:01.083 --> 06:02.750
because when Dumas arrives,

06:02.875 --> 06:05.833
the areas we have interest in
will be off limits,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.042
so it might provide some
answers to the overall mystery.

06:11.208 --> 06:13.458
We couldn't ask for
any better news,

06:13.583 --> 06:15.667
so we're exceedingly grateful.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.958
And, uh,
we'll have everything ready

06:18.125 --> 06:19.750
and in place and ready to start.

06:19.958 --> 06:21.167
See you out there.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.625
Looking forward to it.

06:22.833 --> 06:23.833
-Thank you.
-All right, take care guys.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.125
-Bye, guys.
-Thank you.

06:25.208 --> 06:26.458
RICK:
Let's get out there.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.500
NARRATOR:
As Rick, Marty, Craig and Scott

06:28.708 --> 06:30.583
conclude their meeting
in the war room...

06:30.708 --> 06:32.500
GARY:
I'm really confident, mate.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.417
The beach has got our money.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.833
NARRATOR: ...metal detection
expert Gary Drayton

06:37.000 --> 06:39.667
and Peter Fornetti
arrive at the shoreline

06:39.792 --> 06:42.958
of Lot 5 to expand
their search of an area

06:43.125 --> 06:46.500
that has proven to be
rich with important clues.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.750
GARY:
You pick the lucky flag, Pete.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.167
PETE:
Let's go right in the slipway.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.667
Okay.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.833
And notice where
these flags are, mate.

06:54.042 --> 06:56.167
They're dead opposite
those two features,

06:56.333 --> 06:57.333
the big round one,

06:57.458 --> 06:59.000
and then that feature there

06:59.167 --> 07:01.792
where all the archeologists
are working further up the hill.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.167
-Perfect line for a ship.
-Oh, yeah.

07:04.375 --> 07:07.333
NARRATOR:
Since Rick, Marty
and Craig's purchase

07:07.500 --> 07:09.625
of Lot 5 one year ago,

07:09.792 --> 07:12.167
they have made
compelling discoveries here

07:12.375 --> 07:15.500
that suggest
multiple secretive operations

07:15.667 --> 07:17.583
may have taken place
on Oak Island

07:17.750 --> 07:21.792
before the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.333
These finds include
three Roman coins

07:25.500 --> 07:29.000
dating back
as much as 2,000 years

07:29.208 --> 07:32.333
and a 14th-century
lead barter token that,

07:32.500 --> 07:35.292
just like the lead cross
that was discovered

07:35.458 --> 07:38.375
at Smith's Cove in 2017,

07:38.542 --> 07:41.167
may be connected
to the medieval order

07:41.292 --> 07:43.542
of the Knights Templar.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.000
Near the center of the lot,

07:46.167 --> 07:48.375
they have unearthed
a rectangular foundation

07:48.542 --> 07:50.458
that was deliberately buried

07:50.583 --> 07:53.500
and could date to
the same period in the 1700s

07:53.667 --> 07:56.042
as the Garden Shaft.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.542
And nearer to the shore,

07:58.708 --> 08:00.417
they are also
currently investigating

08:00.583 --> 08:03.167
a mysterious circular depression

08:03.375 --> 08:07.333
that may have been created
sometime in the late 1600s.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.500
All right.
You picked this flag, mate.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.167
Let's make it lucky.

08:12.542 --> 08:13.708
(metal detector beeping)

08:13.875 --> 08:15.208
A bit jumpy.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.500
It's coming out, mate.
It's there.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.083
NARRATOR:
Now, it is Gary
and Peter's hope

08:22.250 --> 08:26.125
to find more definitive clues
on the beach of Lot 5

08:26.208 --> 08:28.708
that might help explain
who could be connected

08:28.875 --> 08:31.083
to these incredible discoveries.

08:31.208 --> 08:32.458
(beeping)

08:35.083 --> 08:36.292
Pin-pointer time.

08:36.458 --> 08:38.125
(beeping)

08:40.333 --> 08:41.667
There it is.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.958
-Oh, yeah.
-What do we got here?

08:51.292 --> 08:53.500
This might be
a small cribbing spike,

08:53.667 --> 08:54.708
which makes this
really interesting.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.542
We have never found one...

08:56.708 --> 08:58.958
-Mm-hmm.
-...on this side
of the island before.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.792
And in this condition,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.125
it's probably
wrought iron, mate.

09:04.292 --> 09:05.500
-It's what it looks like.
-Yeah.

09:05.625 --> 09:06.750
It looks like the other
stuff we found.

09:06.917 --> 09:07.833
Yeah, it really does,
doesn't it?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.167
It does look old.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.167
And they weren't just used

09:11.375 --> 09:14.375
for shafts and tunnels.

09:14.542 --> 09:17.917
These were used
for buildings and also

09:18.042 --> 09:20.333
-on boats and wharfs as well.
-Yeah.

09:20.542 --> 09:21.792
-We'll bag it...
-Yeah.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.375
...'cause this is
an interesting find.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.125
These types of fasteners

09:25.292 --> 09:28.000
are called cribbing spikes,

09:28.167 --> 09:31.875
and it was for attaching
two timbers together.

09:32.042 --> 09:35.583
We're finding a wide variety
of artifacts in this area.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.417
Okay, mate.
Next flag's over here.

09:37.583 --> 09:41.542
I told the guys
Lot 5 is me priority

09:41.708 --> 09:45.458
because we are finding
some of the oldest artifacts

09:45.625 --> 09:48.333
you can find
in North America on Lot 5.

09:48.542 --> 09:50.125
-Right here?
-Yep.

09:50.208 --> 09:53.167
There's a heck of a lot of iron
in that area, and I know

09:53.250 --> 09:57.917
there are more important
artifacts to be found there.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.958
(beeping)

10:01.625 --> 10:03.625
-That's where I got the hit.
-Yep.

10:03.792 --> 10:05.917
And more than likely, it's iron.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.917
Oh, there it is. I see it.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.667
Oh, wow.

10:17.667 --> 10:18.917
GARY:
Oh, wow.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.292
Looks like it's
an old piece of iron.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.000
-Yeah.
-Oh, interesting.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.583
NARRATOR: On the shoreline
of Lot 5,

10:26.750 --> 10:29.167
Gary Drayton and Peter Fornetti

10:29.292 --> 10:31.833
have just made a potentially
significant discovery.

10:32.042 --> 10:33.417
GARY:
Maybe it's a handle.

10:33.542 --> 10:35.542
It looks like
it's broken just there.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.333
Um, this could possibly be

10:38.500 --> 10:42.167
one half of a pair of shears

10:42.375 --> 10:44.208
or some kind of snipping tool.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.375
-Mm-hmm.
-It reminds me

10:46.583 --> 10:50.333
of the handles on
those old Spanish scissors

10:50.542 --> 10:52.500
that Dan Blankenship found.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.042
-Mm-hmm. Definitely.
-Yeah.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.542
NARRATOR: While investigating
Smith's Cove

10:56.708 --> 10:59.208
in the summer of 1970,

10:59.375 --> 11:02.208
the late Oak Island
treasure hunter Dan Blankenship

11:02.375 --> 11:06.500
uncovered a pair of
hand-forged iron scissors.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.167
Incredibly, subsequent
testing indicated

11:10.333 --> 11:13.625
that they not only dated as
far back as the 17th century

11:13.833 --> 11:16.833
but were also of Spanish origin.

11:17.042 --> 11:20.000
GARY:
Carmen Legge will take
a look at that and tell us.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.958
He'll render an opinion.

11:22.083 --> 11:24.708
NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that Gary and Peter

11:24.875 --> 11:26.833
have now found
a related artifact

11:26.958 --> 11:29.083
a half-mile away on Lot 5?

11:29.250 --> 11:32.375
If so, could it help
reveal the truth

11:32.542 --> 11:35.833
behind the 228-year-old mystery?

11:36.042 --> 11:38.375
-All right, I'll bag it.
-Yep. Sounds good.

11:38.542 --> 11:40.625
RICK:
Dan's find of
an old pair of scissors

11:40.708 --> 11:41.833
was quite a find for him,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.375
because to him, in his mind,

11:44.500 --> 11:48.042
he believed that this was
a Spanish treasure,

11:48.208 --> 11:51.042
so it reinforced to him
that he was on the right track.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.208
GARY:
We've got some
interesting finds, mate.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.208
-I say we take 'em
back to the lab.
-Yep.

11:55.375 --> 11:58.125
GARY:
And then, when the tide
goes out, we'll be back.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.917
NARRATOR:
While Gary and Peter

12:00.083 --> 12:02.792
conclude their search
on the beach at Lot 5,

12:02.917 --> 12:05.125
approximately 50 yards inland...

12:05.250 --> 12:06.667
JACK:
Hi, everybody.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.333
-How's the dig going? Good.
-HELEN: Hi, Jack.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.292
-How you doing?
-Good.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.792
NARRATOR: ...Jack Begley joins
archeologist Helen Sheldon,

12:12.917 --> 12:15.000
and other members of the team,

12:15.125 --> 12:18.042
at the mysterious
rectangular stone feature,

12:18.208 --> 12:21.667
which may be related
to the Garden Shaft.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.500
HELEN:
I'll tell you, Jack,
it's the first time

12:23.667 --> 12:25.208
in 40 years of fieldwork

12:25.375 --> 12:27.792
I have seen
something like this buried,

12:27.958 --> 12:29.208
which is really weird.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.333
It's fun seeing you
so excited, Helen.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.000
-(laughs)
-And to know that

12:33.125 --> 12:35.042
you haven't seen
a feature like this before.

12:35.208 --> 12:36.125
No.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.125
JACK:
Is it normal

12:39.208 --> 12:42.333
for the foundation to be
so low in the ground?

12:42.542 --> 12:44.458
HELEN:
No. Normally, you see

12:44.583 --> 12:46.167
an indication of it
on the surface.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.125
(sighs) Well,
that makes me think

12:48.292 --> 12:51.208
that it's somehow related
to the Money Pit story.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.833
This could've been base camp

12:53.042 --> 12:54.375
for operations in the Money Pit.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.417
Something happened on Lot 5.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.333
We just need to keep digging

12:58.542 --> 13:00.000
and gather more evidence
and find out

13:00.125 --> 13:02.417
what actually was going on here.
That's the plan.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.208
-JACK: I'd be happy to sift.
-HELEN: Okay, sounds good, Jack.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.167
-JAMIE: Sounds great.
-LINDY: Sounds good. Thanks.

13:06.375 --> 13:09.083
NARRATOR:
While the archeologists

13:09.250 --> 13:11.667
continue to carefully
scrape away dirt and sediments

13:11.875 --> 13:13.167
from the rock feature,

13:13.333 --> 13:15.667
Jack will sift
the collected spoils

13:15.875 --> 13:19.167
to search for any possible
clues or artifacts.

13:19.292 --> 13:22.292
JACK:
Lot 5 is still such a mystery.

13:22.458 --> 13:23.333
There's so many other

13:23.542 --> 13:25.333
odd features around Lot 5

13:25.542 --> 13:27.208
and weird finds that Gary's had,

13:27.375 --> 13:30.875
that I still think
there's a good chance

13:31.042 --> 13:32.542
this was some sort of
an encampment

13:32.708 --> 13:35.167
and this is just a start

13:35.333 --> 13:39.542
to really figuring out what
happened here, pre-settlers.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.542
JAMIE:
Ooh. Hey, Jack.

13:43.708 --> 13:46.042
-Yeah.
-We've found

13:46.250 --> 13:48.583
the biggest piece of creamware
so far today in this unit.

13:48.708 --> 13:50.083
Great. Let's have a look.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.667
JAMIE:
Just the tiniest
piece of glaze

13:51.833 --> 13:54.042
so I can identify it.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.583
JACK:
What type of pottery is this?

13:57.750 --> 13:59.250
JAMIE:
So that's the creamware.

13:59.417 --> 14:02.667
That's the stuff
that was first made in 1762.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.042
NARRATOR:
A piece of creamware pottery

14:05.167 --> 14:08.375
dating to as early as 1762?

14:08.542 --> 14:12.750
Has Jamie Kouba found more
evidence supporting the theory

14:12.917 --> 14:15.667
that Lot 5 may have been
a staging ground

14:15.875 --> 14:17.667
for a secret operation

14:17.833 --> 14:20.500
prior to the discovery
of the Money Pit?

14:21.833 --> 14:22.958
JACK:
It'd be nice to find

14:23.125 --> 14:24.667
enough pieces
that we can start to

14:24.792 --> 14:26.333
-put it back together.
-Yeah.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.708
JACK:
Nice find.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.417
Let me know
when you find a coin.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.000
JAMIE:
I'm looking.

14:32.208 --> 14:33.333
NARRATOR:
As the investigation efforts

14:33.500 --> 14:35.417
continue on Lot 5...

14:36.417 --> 14:37.958
STEVE:
There could be wood right there.

14:38.125 --> 14:40.083
NARRATOR:
...back in the Money Pit area...

14:41.917 --> 14:42.958
-Yeah. That... Yep.
-That is wood.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.167
NARRATOR:
...Alex Lagina

14:44.292 --> 14:46.042
and other members of the team

14:46.167 --> 14:48.167
have just made a potentially

14:48.250 --> 14:53.042
important discovery
in Borehole D.5N-27

14:53.167 --> 14:56.375
located several feet east
of the Garden Shaft.

14:57.667 --> 14:58.667
What you got for depth there?

14:58.792 --> 14:59.833
It's gonna be 95 feet.

15:00.042 --> 15:01.167
95 with wood. Cool.

15:01.375 --> 15:02.875
Oh, yeah,
that's a wood chunk.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.000
-STEVE: That just doesn't
make any sense.
-ALEX: No.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.167
We've usually hit it
at 99 plus.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.750
Yes. Yeah.

15:10.917 --> 15:12.625
NARRATOR:
Because the location

15:12.792 --> 15:14.583
of Borehole D.5N-27

15:14.708 --> 15:18.875
is in an elevated area
to the east of the Garden Shaft,

15:19.042 --> 15:22.000
the team was not expecting
to encounter the tunnel,

15:22.167 --> 15:24.542
where they have detected
evidence of precious metals,

15:24.708 --> 15:26.500
for several more feet.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.958
Could it be possible
that they have just discovered

15:30.125 --> 15:32.667
a completely
different structure?

15:32.833 --> 15:34.083
This doesn't look like
the wood we've hit

15:34.250 --> 15:35.667
in previous boreholes
in the tunnel.

15:35.833 --> 15:36.667
-Hey, Scott.
-Hey, guys.

15:36.833 --> 15:37.667
We've got a bit of a ...

15:37.792 --> 15:38.750
Looks like spruce.

15:38.917 --> 15:40.083
...a question. Yeah. It's...

15:40.250 --> 15:42.667
To me, it's a different
type of wood.

15:42.833 --> 15:43.792
It's higher
than we typically see it.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.333
STEVE:
Yeah.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.625
ALEX:
This is really, really weird

15:46.792 --> 15:48.042
because there is no record

15:48.208 --> 15:49.583
of anything at this depth
in this area.

15:49.708 --> 15:51.167
-Hey, fellas.
-Yeah.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.458
ALEX: This is a totally
unknown structure.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.542
-Wow.
-Oh, look what we found.

15:55.708 --> 15:57.167
ALEX:
It's possibly the top
of an offset chamber

15:57.333 --> 15:59.417
for all we know.
It's a big deal.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.375
I don't think anybody
expected to see that.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.083
STEVE:
Different wood.
Different height.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.208
-It's a different structure.
-TERRY: I don't know.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.958
-Here comes more information.
-TERRY: Right on.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.833
This is going to be 101 feet.

16:11.042 --> 16:13.167
-101.
-101. Thank you.

16:13.292 --> 16:16.333
All right, let's carve it up.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.417
What do we got?
Okay, there's some more wood,

16:19.625 --> 16:23.000
but... is it in place or not?

16:23.167 --> 16:24.042
SCOTT:
We've lost recovery

16:24.208 --> 16:26.125
from-- basically from 95

16:26.292 --> 16:28.042
to 101.
We just pushed through it.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.917
And the loose material
falling out, though,

16:30.083 --> 16:32.667
that says that possibly,
it's a... it's a tunnel.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.792
But it's out of place, isn't it?

16:33.958 --> 16:35.792
SCOTT:
It's out of place.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.167
-Hey, fellas.
-ALEX: Hey.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.250
CRAIG: What's
the news, gentlemen?

16:39.417 --> 16:41.833
SCOTT: We're finding timbers
at 95 feet.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.167
CRAIG:
That's at a shallower depth

16:44.333 --> 16:45.667
than anything
we've seen in the area,

16:45.792 --> 16:48.125
so, to me, it's got to be new.

16:48.292 --> 16:51.292
The other problem with this,
though, is we're out of time.

16:51.458 --> 16:54.292
-We got the crane
chasing us off this area.
-Yeah.

16:54.458 --> 16:58.167
NARRATOR:
Because representatives
from Dumas Contracting Limited

16:58.333 --> 17:00.000
will soon arrive on Oak Island

17:00.125 --> 17:02.292
with numerous
heavy digging machines

17:02.500 --> 17:04.625
needed to deepen
the Garden Shaft,

17:04.792 --> 17:08.792
that means that the team
will no longer be able

17:08.958 --> 17:12.042
to drill in this area for
potential valuable targets.

17:13.042 --> 17:14.958
RICK:
We are under time constraints.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.833
We have one more chance
to try to

17:17.000 --> 17:18.917
delineate this tunnel
that we seek,

17:19.083 --> 17:21.167
because once Dumas comes in,

17:21.333 --> 17:23.458
certain areas of the Money Pit
will be off limits.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.833
We have time to drill one more
hole here if we want to.

17:26.042 --> 17:28.167
I'd drill one more.
I'd drill until it's coming.

17:28.292 --> 17:29.458
Yeah.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.125
RICK:
We are in a bit of a haste

17:31.250 --> 17:32.667
to try to hit a target.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.292
We're not certain
of the data yet.

17:34.458 --> 17:36.833
We have to continue
to drill and hopefully

17:37.000 --> 17:39.333
something more definitive
will come from that drilling.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.042
There's a lot of
"homework" to do here.

17:42.208 --> 17:43.458
I can't stand here
right now and tell you

17:43.458 --> 17:43.833
I can't stand here
right now and tell you

17:44.667 --> 17:46.167
what I think this is
'cause I don't know.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.625
-But we have to follow it.
-Yeah.

17:48.792 --> 17:52.125
Just what we need,
another mystery on Oak Island.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.833
(truck horn honks)

17:57.958 --> 18:01.583
NARRATOR:
A day that has been
highly anticipated by Rick,

18:01.708 --> 18:04.833
Marty, Craig and the rest
of the Oak Island team

18:05.000 --> 18:06.708
has finally arrived.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.417
Here he comes.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.167
NARRATOR:
Having received

18:10.333 --> 18:12.208
the necessary
governmental permits,

18:12.375 --> 18:15.333
representatives from
Dumas Contracting Limited

18:15.542 --> 18:17.792
and Irving Equipment Limited

18:17.958 --> 18:21.042
have begun to deliver
heavy equipment,

18:21.208 --> 18:24.042
starting with a 109-ton crane...

18:24.208 --> 18:25.667
-RICK: Hey, Bill.
-Good morning.

18:25.833 --> 18:26.958
NARRATOR: ...that will be used

18:27.125 --> 18:27.958
to deepen the Garden Shaft

18:28.125 --> 18:29.500
in the Money Pit area,

18:29.625 --> 18:31.750
and hopefully
help the team solve

18:31.917 --> 18:34.833
the 228-year-old mystery.

18:35.042 --> 18:37.333
MARTY:
Okay, put that crane together

18:37.500 --> 18:39.958
because last year,
we feel like we got

18:40.083 --> 18:42.292
just about to
where we needed to be,

18:42.417 --> 18:44.542
and we needed to go deeper.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.042
So that's the drill.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.125
And this is the year.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.667
Aw, yeah. Aw, yeah.

18:49.875 --> 18:50.792
So, we're counting on you.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.167
(laughter)

18:52.333 --> 18:53.792
RICK: We really, really

18:54.000 --> 18:55.208
want to put this thing to bed,

18:55.375 --> 18:57.542
put a period
at the end of this story.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.083
BILLY:
We want to put
an exclamation mark

18:59.208 --> 19:00.167
on the end of the story,
not a period, right?

19:00.375 --> 19:01.500
Well, there you go.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.625
(chuckling)

19:02.833 --> 19:04.083
And without people like you,

19:04.250 --> 19:05.958
it's not possible.

19:06.042 --> 19:08.000
But more to the point, what
Marty said, this is the year.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.500
I'd say, let's get going.

19:09.708 --> 19:10.833
Let's roll in and
get this crane together.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.292
-Yep.
-Perfect.

19:14.625 --> 19:17.000
RICK: The Garden Shaft
extension project

19:17.167 --> 19:19.333
is going to be
highly informative.

19:19.542 --> 19:22.000
Without the crane,
we can't even begin to start.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.708
One piece of the puzzle
is now in place.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.667
We now await Dumas' arrival,

19:26.833 --> 19:27.958
and we can start that project

19:28.167 --> 19:30.333
and get some answers.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.667
BILL:
Come this way
another foot or two.

19:34.083 --> 19:37.417
NARRATOR:
Once the crane is fully
assembled in the coming days...

19:37.583 --> 19:39.833
-BILL: This way a bit.
-NARRATOR: ...it will
be used to maneuver

19:40.042 --> 19:41.500
a three-ton hammer grab tool

19:41.708 --> 19:44.125
that will remove
the earth and sediment

19:44.250 --> 19:45.917
that sits at the bottom
of the Garden Shaft.

19:46.042 --> 19:47.000
BILL:
That's good.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.333
NARRATOR:
This will allow
the team from Dumas

19:50.458 --> 19:53.000
to begin extending
the 18th-century structure

19:53.167 --> 19:55.167
down an additional 20 feet

19:55.333 --> 19:57.250
into the believed
treasure tunnel

19:57.458 --> 20:00.583
that the team has discovered
several feet below it.

20:01.708 --> 20:04.125
MARTY:
We know there's a tunnel
under the Garden Shaft

20:04.333 --> 20:06.167
that could be
going to an offset chamber.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.042
There could be
a large treasure down there.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.917
There are lots of possibilities

20:10.083 --> 20:12.250
in the next 20 feet
of the Garden Shaft.

20:13.458 --> 20:14.792
OULETTE:
That's good, she's tight.

20:14.958 --> 20:15.917
BILL:
Awesome.

20:18.042 --> 20:21.500
NARRATOR:
As the crane assembly begins
on the South Shore road...

20:23.125 --> 20:25.292
ALEX:
Hey, guys. Where are we?

20:25.417 --> 20:27.625
Same line,
just five feet further south.

20:27.792 --> 20:30.042
-Got it.
-NARRATOR: ...Alex Lagina

20:30.167 --> 20:31.500
arrives at the Money Pit area

20:31.667 --> 20:34.667
where the team has already begun

20:34.833 --> 20:39.167
a new core-drilling operation
in Borehole C5N-27,

20:39.333 --> 20:42.667
located several feet east
of the Garden Shaft.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.375
It is the team's goal

20:44.542 --> 20:46.667
to not only encounter
another section

20:46.750 --> 20:48.958
of the seven-and-a-half-
foot-high tunnel

20:49.125 --> 20:51.333
some 100 feet underground,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.750
but also identify
a valuable target

20:53.958 --> 20:57.000
that Dumas may be able
to help them recover

20:57.167 --> 20:59.083
by constructing a new tunnel

20:59.250 --> 21:01.292
from the bottom
of the Garden Shaft.

21:01.458 --> 21:03.083
ALEX:
Okay, here's the thing, guys.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.833
This is our last shot at this.

21:05.000 --> 21:05.833
We have this hole,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.875
whenever we finish it,

21:08.042 --> 21:09.250
and then the crane moves in.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.208
-The crane needs
to be right here.
-Yeah.

21:13.583 --> 21:14.708
ALEX:
We need to find something

21:14.875 --> 21:16.375
quickly, 'cause right now,

21:16.583 --> 21:18.542
we're drilling in an area that's
going to become off-limits

21:18.708 --> 21:21.667
as soon as Dumas is ready
to put people underground.

21:21.875 --> 21:24.333
-We can do stuff elsewhere...
-Yeah.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.792
...it's just that we can't be

21:25.958 --> 21:27.375
this close to the Garden Shaft,

21:27.542 --> 21:29.000
and unfortunately,
what we're looking for

21:29.167 --> 21:30.417
goes right under
the Garden Shaft.

21:30.583 --> 21:31.792
-Yeah, that's right.
-So this is

21:31.917 --> 21:33.500
where our best chance
of hitting it is.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.250
Yeah,
it's a time crunch, though.

21:35.375 --> 21:37.250
It's a time crunch on
the whole drill program

21:37.375 --> 21:39.000
-in this area. So...
-Absolutely. Yeah.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.167
ALEX:
Keep your fingers crossed.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.042
NARRATOR:
As the core-drilling operation

21:43.208 --> 21:45.542
continues in
the Money Pit area...

21:48.208 --> 21:50.250
RICK: Carmen,
thank you for coming back.

21:50.417 --> 21:52.167
Gary and Peter
have actually found

21:52.375 --> 21:54.333
a very interesting item.

21:54.542 --> 21:56.333
NARRATOR: ...at the Oak Island
Interpretive Centre,

21:56.542 --> 21:59.458
Rick Lagina, along with
other members of the team,

21:59.625 --> 22:02.000
meet with blacksmithing expert
Carmen Legge,

22:02.167 --> 22:06.125
to have him examine the fragment
of potentially ancient scissors

22:06.333 --> 22:09.333
discovered one day ago on Lot 5.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.333
GARY:
Pete and I dug it out,

22:11.542 --> 22:13.333
and it so reminded me

22:13.542 --> 22:14.875
of that pair of shears,

22:15.042 --> 22:17.000
that old Spanish shears

22:17.208 --> 22:19.083
that Dan Blankenship found

22:19.250 --> 22:21.542
in Smith's Cove
during that excavation.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.417
Okay, I'll take a look here.

22:27.542 --> 22:30.083
Well, your hunch is right.

22:30.250 --> 22:31.833
It is a handle
off a pair of scissors.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.583
RICK:
Any way to infer a date?

22:47.833 --> 22:50.000
CARMEN:
This is very old.
And very old, I mean,

22:50.208 --> 22:53.667
1600, early 1700s.

22:53.875 --> 22:55.083
Wow.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.583
I can go grab them.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.292
RICK:
When Carmen related

23:04.375 --> 23:07.667
that the handle was a date

23:07.833 --> 23:09.667
1600 to 1700s...

23:09.875 --> 23:12.292
CARMEN:
'Cause this is one
continuous loop, right?

23:12.458 --> 23:15.958
RICK:
...are those original
deposition artifacts

23:16.125 --> 23:18.458
or do they pre-date that?

23:18.625 --> 23:21.667
That's really what we're trying
to do with dating artifacts.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.500
Are they
pre- or post-depositional?

23:30.042 --> 23:31.167
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

23:31.375 --> 23:32.583
This-this is,

23:32.708 --> 23:34.667
so this pair of scissors
was older than that.

23:34.833 --> 23:36.083
Brilliant.

23:36.292 --> 23:37.167
NARRATOR:
The scissor fragment

23:37.333 --> 23:39.833
found on the beach of Lot 5,

23:40.042 --> 23:42.167
potentially dating back
to the 1600s?

23:42.333 --> 23:47.667
The same era as the mysterious
circular feature located nearby?

23:47.875 --> 23:50.667
Could it be related
to another compelling clue

23:50.875 --> 23:54.583
that was recently discovered
within that same feature?

23:55.042 --> 23:56.458
MARTY:
It looks like a latch, Laird.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.000
NARRATOR:
Three weeks ago,

23:58.167 --> 24:00.292
at the bottom of the structure,

24:00.458 --> 24:02.833
the team discovered a latch

24:03.000 --> 24:04.958
designed for
lifting heavy cargo.

24:05.125 --> 24:06.667
MARTY:
I'd say it was made

24:06.792 --> 24:08.167
to be driven into something.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.875
NARRATOR:
Incredibly, it was found

24:10.042 --> 24:12.500
to be a compositional match
to artifacts

24:12.667 --> 24:15.417
known to have belonged
to the 17th-century

24:15.583 --> 24:18.000
English politician
Sir William Phips,

24:18.208 --> 24:20.583
a man believed by some

24:20.708 --> 24:22.375
to have conspired with
a prominent Freemason

24:22.542 --> 24:24.667
named Andrew Belcher

24:24.833 --> 24:30.375
to bury a large cache of
treasure on Oak Island in 1687.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.708
GARY:
Lot 5 is where

24:32.875 --> 24:36.667
we're finding those
incredible artifacts, coins.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.208
-Yeah.
-GARY: Brilliant stuff,

24:38.375 --> 24:40.125
this included.

24:40.250 --> 24:43.167
NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that Gary and Peter

24:43.375 --> 24:45.250
have found another critical clue

24:45.417 --> 24:47.333
that could prove that theory?

24:47.542 --> 24:50.500
And perhaps explain
the high trace evidence

24:50.708 --> 24:52.917
of precious metals
that have been detected

24:53.083 --> 24:56.167
near the Garden Shaft
in the Money Pit area?

24:56.292 --> 24:58.583
GARY:
And hopefully,
there's some more parts of it.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.125
They might be on the beach.

25:00.292 --> 25:01.750
PETER:
Yeah.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.167
That's the front door to Lot 5.

25:03.292 --> 25:05.333
-PETER: Yeah.
-100%. Yep.

25:05.542 --> 25:07.208
I want to see
some more of these items.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.375
And Gary will
continue to find...

25:08.542 --> 25:09.375
And not pieces.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.042
And not pieces.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.500
-(laughter)
-Oh, I will.

25:12.708 --> 25:13.958
Thank you, Carmen.
I appreciate it.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.167
All right. See you later.

25:15.292 --> 25:16.708
Happy searching.

25:16.875 --> 25:23.083
GARY:
Great, mate. Thanks.

25:23.083 --> 25:25.167
NARRATOR:
While the assembly
of the massive crane

25:25.292 --> 25:28.625
continues on the road
just south of the swamp...

25:30.250 --> 25:32.833
...and as more heavy equipment
arrives on Oak Island

25:32.958 --> 25:36.208
for the upcoming operation
to deepen the Garden Shaft...

25:37.417 --> 25:38.333
ALEX:
Hey, everybody.

25:38.542 --> 25:39.875
This is quite a team now.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.333
-MOYA: Oh, hey, Alex.
-HELEN: Oh, yeah.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.208
-How's it going?
-Good.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.625
NARRATOR: ...Alex Lagina joins
archeologists Helen Sheldon

25:46.792 --> 25:49.375
and Moya MacDonald on Lot 5

25:49.542 --> 25:52.042
as they continue
their investigation

25:52.208 --> 25:54.583
of the rectangular
stone foundation.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.125
ALEX:
Any new information?

25:57.250 --> 25:59.333
We've got more white
salt-glazed stoneware,

25:59.500 --> 26:02.625
which is the earlier stuff,
like mid-1700s.

26:02.792 --> 26:04.792
Like 1740 to 1760-ish.
-Okay.

26:04.958 --> 26:06.917
Um, and some more creamware.

26:07.042 --> 26:08.833
Today we had

26:09.000 --> 26:11.958
part of a little,
um, porcelain teacup.

26:12.125 --> 26:13.833
-Oh.
-Which is interesting,
because porcelain

26:14.000 --> 26:15.667
-was a high-end material.
-ALEX: Right. That's awesome.

26:15.792 --> 26:17.542
Moya, what do you think so far?

26:17.708 --> 26:19.583
We've been finding
a lot of pearlware...

26:19.750 --> 26:21.667
ALEX: Mm-hmm.
-...which is also
pretty consistent

26:21.833 --> 26:24.667
with the kind of time period
we're looking at.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.250
Mm-hmm.
It is not really consistent

26:26.417 --> 26:27.750
with the Oak Island story

26:27.917 --> 26:29.667
in that we don't know of
any structures here at the time.

26:29.833 --> 26:31.500
HELEN:
We don't.

26:31.667 --> 26:35.000
So this would have probably
been before the island

26:35.208 --> 26:38.333
was actually divided up
into the four-acre lots.

26:38.458 --> 26:40.500
-Mm-hmm. Okay.
-So, this predates that.

26:40.708 --> 26:43.167
Pre-discovery of the Money Pit,
too, if we're right.

26:44.833 --> 26:49.000
NARRATOR:
Of the more than
350 islands in Mahone Bay,

26:49.208 --> 26:52.458
Oak Island was
the only one divided up

26:52.625 --> 26:54.833
into individual four-acre lots

26:55.000 --> 26:59.792
by the English surveyor general
Charles Morris in 1762,

26:59.958 --> 27:03.167
33 years before
the discovery of the Money Pit.

27:03.333 --> 27:07.667
Although it is unknown why
Mr. Morris made this decision,

27:07.833 --> 27:10.500
could the fact that he was
a high-ranking Freemason

27:10.708 --> 27:12.500
offer a clue?

27:12.708 --> 27:14.500
Might he have had
secret knowledge

27:14.708 --> 27:17.000
of the mysterious
structures on Lot 5,

27:17.167 --> 27:21.250
and perhaps a vast treasure
buried deep in the Money Pit?

27:22.792 --> 27:24.792
HELEN:
So, preliminary deductions here

27:24.958 --> 27:28.625
is that this is
a rock-lined pit...

27:28.750 --> 27:30.750
-Mm-hmm.
-...that was then
actually covered up.

27:32.167 --> 27:33.625
Because we've got very loose
rubble in the middle,

27:33.792 --> 27:37.500
and on top,
like it was filled in.

27:37.667 --> 27:38.917
We have a few artifacts
in this layer,

27:39.083 --> 27:40.375
-and then above it...
-Oh, yeah.

27:40.542 --> 27:42.500
...you have an absolutely
barren layer

27:42.708 --> 27:44.833
-with no artifacts in it at all.
-Right.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.208
ALEX:
It is unusual

27:47.375 --> 27:49.583
that this site appears
to have been covered back up.

27:49.708 --> 27:52.000
In the context of Oak Island,
when you have

27:52.208 --> 27:54.417
this secret treasure
being hidden here,

27:54.542 --> 27:56.917
the people
that may have done that

27:57.083 --> 27:59.292
would have wanted
to keep everything a secret.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.625
So-so, there's your reason
that this was covered back in.

28:03.375 --> 28:04.333
Well, it's fascinating.

28:04.458 --> 28:05.750
I mean, Lot 5, we have

28:05.917 --> 28:07.417
all kinds of really strange

28:07.583 --> 28:09.083
metal-detecting finds
on the lot.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.042
-Yeah, we do.
-ALEX: And, you know,

28:11.208 --> 28:13.667
it could be
a really meaningful piece

28:13.833 --> 28:16.208
to the puzzle, whatever
might have happened. So...

28:16.375 --> 28:17.458
So, thanks for the update.

28:17.625 --> 28:18.583
Well, we'll let you know

28:18.750 --> 28:20.125
if anything exciting comes up.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.792
-ALEX: Thank you.
-HELEN: See you, Alex.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.917
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

28:29.833 --> 28:31.167
We have a core.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.667
I got it.

28:32.875 --> 28:33.792
NARRATOR:
...Alex Lagina has returned to

28:34.000 --> 28:35.208
the Money Pit area.

28:35.375 --> 28:37.292
Ninety-three!

28:37.375 --> 28:39.500
NARRATOR:
...to monitor
the core-drilling operation

28:39.625 --> 28:41.917
in Borehole C5N-27...

28:42.083 --> 28:44.167
-You got it?
-I got her, yeah.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.583
NARRATOR:
...the final borehole
that the team

28:46.750 --> 28:48.292
will be able to complete
near the Garden Shaft

28:48.458 --> 28:51.333
before representatives
from Dumas Contracting Limited

28:51.542 --> 28:54.042
arrive on the island.

28:54.208 --> 28:55.708
All right.

28:55.875 --> 28:57.625
Let's cleave her open,
gentlemen.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.250
Let's see what's up.

29:00.542 --> 29:01.917
93, well...

29:05.208 --> 29:06.333
It's maroon till,

29:06.542 --> 29:08.708
full of cobbles.

29:09.583 --> 29:10.667
-Thank you.
-There's some slough

29:10.833 --> 29:12.833
-on top of this.
-Okay.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.458
Okay.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.500
Nothing but Mother Nature,

29:16.708 --> 29:18.333
and it's pretty firm.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.042
93 feet below grade.

29:23.042 --> 29:27.167
C.5N-27 has yielded up
very little

29:27.292 --> 29:28.792
in terms of treasure.

29:33.042 --> 29:34.208
ALEX: This is, like,

29:34.375 --> 29:35.708
time crunch

29:35.875 --> 29:37.500
-of all time crunches for us.
-Oh, yeah.

29:37.625 --> 29:39.542
'Cause the crane needs to be
right where that drill rig is.

29:39.708 --> 29:42.000
-CRAIG: Yeah,
tomorrow morning, so...
-ALEX: Like, like... Yeah.

29:42.208 --> 29:43.958
TERRY:
Hopefully we'll get
what we need here

29:44.125 --> 29:45.542
because we won't be able
to get back for a while.

29:45.708 --> 29:47.375
Yep.

29:47.542 --> 29:50.958
With Dumas coming in
a very short period of time

29:51.167 --> 29:53.625
to start deepening
the Garden Shaft,

29:53.708 --> 29:55.542
we need to get
all the information,

29:55.708 --> 29:57.458
because once
the equipment is moved in,

29:57.583 --> 29:59.167
we need to move the drill rig.

29:59.375 --> 30:02.833
So, I'm eager to find out
as much information as we can

30:03.000 --> 30:05.042
to get us
our best possible target

30:05.208 --> 30:08.292
before Dumas has
to move their equipment in.

30:09.875 --> 30:11.708
BRENNAN:
Went in the void, man!

30:11.875 --> 30:12.958
TEDFORD:
Oh, that's a good sign.

30:13.042 --> 30:15.292
So it dropped to 104.

30:16.542 --> 30:18.292
This will be the run. Yep.

30:20.958 --> 30:22.917
CHARLES:
There it is, gentlemen.
We have a core.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.833
TEDFORD:
Might actually be
into something here.

30:29.042 --> 30:30.542
When I ran the casing,

30:30.708 --> 30:32.583
-it dropped to 104.
-ALEX: Down to 104?

30:32.708 --> 30:33.917
So is any of that in here?

30:34.125 --> 30:35.167
-We'll see how long it is.
-ALEX: Okay.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.500
The rods dropped down.

30:37.583 --> 30:38.875
That's usually an indication

30:39.083 --> 30:40.917
that the soil,
the ground, the earth

30:41.083 --> 30:43.292
underneath is disturbed.

30:43.458 --> 30:44.917
So, it's a good indication

30:45.083 --> 30:46.042
that we're in the vicinity
of this tunnel.

30:46.208 --> 30:47.333
CHARLES:
What do we got, Alex?

30:47.542 --> 30:49.083
Ninety-eight.

30:49.208 --> 30:52.083
-98.
-But it dropped to 104.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.083
Got no wood there.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.500
No wood so far.

31:05.167 --> 31:06.750
TERRY:
It's good and firm,

31:06.875 --> 31:08.250
but the rods sank immediately
below this point,

31:08.458 --> 31:09.417
so that's interesting.

31:13.625 --> 31:15.583
CHARLES:
We have a core, gentlemen.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.208
Hopefully we pick up some wood
in the top of this core.

31:18.375 --> 31:19.333
CRAIG:
Yep.

31:19.542 --> 31:20.583
What do we got, Alex?

31:20.708 --> 31:22.292
-111.
-111.

31:22.458 --> 31:24.125
Scott, 111.

31:24.292 --> 31:26.042
All right, well let's take
a hard look at this right here.

31:26.208 --> 31:27.375
Let's see what we got.

31:27.375 --> 31:27.958
Let's see what we got.

31:29.208 --> 31:31.167
-Hello.
-CHARLES: We got wood.

31:32.208 --> 31:34.042
-CRAIG: Wow.
-TERRY: Here we go.

31:36.167 --> 31:36.267
w.

31:37.208 --> 31:37.917
NARRATOR:
In the elevated region

31:38.375 --> 31:40.625
of Money Pit area,
the Oak Island team

31:40.792 --> 31:42.042
may have just penetrated

31:42.208 --> 31:43.458
a possible treasure tunnel

31:43.625 --> 31:44.042
at a depth of
approximately 111 feet.

31:45.042 --> 31:46.917
at a depth of
approximately 111 feet.

31:47.083 --> 31:49.125
STEVE:
Oh, we have wood there, too.

31:49.250 --> 31:54.000
NARRATOR: A tunnel that runs
directly below the Garden Shaft.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.250
-STEVE: Where's it at, Terry?
-108.

31:57.417 --> 32:00.208
That's where the chunk
of wood seems to fall.

32:00.375 --> 32:02.875
It seems pretty firm below.

32:03.042 --> 32:04.667
CRAIG:
You got a piece above that?

32:04.875 --> 32:07.250
TERRY: Yeah,
that's a good point.

32:07.417 --> 32:10.208
Let's have a look.
And actually, yeah, we do.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.625
There's some more wood
impregnated right there.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.958
There's a chunk right there.
That's-that's wood.

32:19.583 --> 32:20.958
Yeah, that's embedded

32:21.125 --> 32:23.375
just above the top of that.

32:25.250 --> 32:29.500
And I think I can see
irregular axe cuts there.

32:30.708 --> 32:31.542
Yeah, maybe right there.

32:31.708 --> 32:33.667
CRAIG:
Yeah.

32:33.792 --> 32:35.500
NARRATOR:
Axe-cut wood,

32:35.667 --> 32:37.375
recovered from
the believed tunnel

32:37.542 --> 32:40.167
that runs below
the Garden Shaft?

32:40.375 --> 32:43.167
Because it is documented
that treasure hunters

32:43.375 --> 32:46.750
began using mechanized saws
in the early 1800s

32:46.958 --> 32:50.167
to construct shafts and tunnels
in the Money Pit area,

32:50.375 --> 32:54.458
could that mean that this tunnel
was created by someone

32:54.625 --> 32:59.542
who deposited valuables
on Oak Island prior to 1795?

33:01.542 --> 33:04.250
TERRY:
There's some kind of a stria
or something going there.

33:04.417 --> 33:07.083
ALEX:
I think I see evidence
that this is hand-hewn,

33:07.250 --> 33:09.125
and so far all the hand-hewn
beams we've found

33:09.292 --> 33:11.958
and dated
have come back really old.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.792
So, there's
a good chance that this

33:13.917 --> 33:15.208
is also a really old beam.

33:15.417 --> 33:17.375
So, obviously,
that's exciting to us.

33:17.542 --> 33:19.500
TERRY:
Anyway, let's have
a look at this one.

33:19.667 --> 33:22.083
See what we got, gentlemen.
Open 'er up.

33:24.833 --> 33:26.500
There's some
wood fiber right there.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.542
Yeah, there's some
fibers in that, Terry.

33:28.708 --> 33:30.542
TERRY:
Yeah. Uh... wow.

33:30.708 --> 33:31.875
We're seeing a lot of

33:32.042 --> 33:34.583
wood chips and chunks.

33:36.125 --> 33:38.833
There's a fairly solid
little chunk of wood.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.875
And it's all above this beam.

33:41.042 --> 33:43.250
So that wood
would seem to be the floor

33:43.375 --> 33:45.583
more so than the roof.

33:45.792 --> 33:48.833
But if it's the roof beam,

33:49.042 --> 33:51.208
I don't know what to make of it.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.833
ALEX:
Well, any big piece of wood

33:54.042 --> 33:55.000
is going to be the ceiling,
not the floor.

33:55.208 --> 33:57.000
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

33:57.167 --> 34:00.000
CRAIG:
If this is the original top

34:00.208 --> 34:01.750
of the tunnel, and
it's been pushed down here,

34:01.917 --> 34:03.333
this material's on top...

34:03.542 --> 34:06.833
I'm wondering if we've had
a significant cave-in,

34:07.000 --> 34:08.875
and our tunnel,

34:09.042 --> 34:11.792
is this debris in through here.

34:11.958 --> 34:13.417
That the whole thing

34:13.583 --> 34:15.500
collapsed down and above that
it's all really loose.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.583
ALEX:
I think it means
we're in a collapse.

34:17.792 --> 34:19.250
I mean, I think the most
we can say about this

34:19.375 --> 34:21.250
is it's a probable hit

34:21.375 --> 34:23.542
-on the tunnel under
the Garden Shaft.
-Yeah.

34:24.792 --> 34:27.000
CRAIG:
Some of this soil we'll
probably want Emma to test.

34:27.125 --> 34:28.250
Some of the wood,

34:28.417 --> 34:30.500
-we may want to do C-14.
-Yep.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.167
-When you bag stuff up...
-Yeah. Okay.

34:32.333 --> 34:34.625
...keep the big,
thick ones separate

34:34.792 --> 34:37.375
-from some pieces
of wood up higher.
-Okay.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.333
NARRATOR:
It is a bittersweet moment

34:39.542 --> 34:40.750
for the Oak Island team.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.500
While they are encouraged

34:42.667 --> 34:44.167
to have possibly
encountered the tunnel

34:44.375 --> 34:46.875
once again,
where high trace evidence

34:47.042 --> 34:48.583
of precious metals
has been detected,

34:48.750 --> 34:51.958
unfortunately,
they were unable to recover

34:52.167 --> 34:53.792
any more clues to determine

34:53.917 --> 34:56.125
just where
the source is located.

34:56.292 --> 34:58.583
However, in the coming days,

34:58.750 --> 35:01.500
representatives from
Dumas Contracting Limited

35:01.708 --> 35:04.000
will begin deepening
the Garden Shaft

35:04.208 --> 35:06.417
to breach this very tunnel.

35:07.417 --> 35:08.792
CRAIG:
Can you put in your notes

35:08.958 --> 35:12.292
the multiple cut
small-cut pieces?

35:12.458 --> 35:14.333
'Cause there's
a lot of them in here.

35:14.542 --> 35:16.167
NARRATOR:
And that will allow the team

35:16.333 --> 35:18.792
to not only better explore it,

35:18.958 --> 35:22.458
but perhaps finally solve
the Oak Island mystery.

35:22.625 --> 35:24.833
ALEX:
We have this mysterious tunnel

35:25.000 --> 35:27.333
with no known origin.
It's just a big mystery.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.833
When Dumas gets here, we are
going to start getting answers.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.458
So, hopefully,
we won't be leaving

35:32.625 --> 35:34.792
unanswered questions
in the ground.

35:35.875 --> 35:37.208
SCOTT:
Well, we do have some
more work to do, I guess,

35:37.375 --> 35:38.458
to try and figure this out.
So...

35:38.625 --> 35:40.958
Yeah, certainly.
I think we need to

35:41.125 --> 35:42.333
look at it on a map, honestly...

35:42.500 --> 35:43.875
-Yeah.
-...and then figure out

35:44.042 --> 35:45.167
where we can drill still.

35:45.292 --> 35:47.000
-Yeah.
-CRAIG: Okay, Terry.

35:47.125 --> 35:49.833
Let you and Steve finish up here

35:50.000 --> 35:51.458
and we will head on back
to the research center.

35:51.458 --> 35:51.750
and we will head on back
to the research center.

35:52.125 --> 35:53.250
-Excellent.
-Okay.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.958
-We'll see you back there.
-Keep in touch.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.167
-Great stuff.
-Thank you.

35:56.292 --> 35:57.750
ALEX:
It's a mystery, that's for sure.

35:57.917 --> 35:58.792
SCOTT:
Yeah.

36:04.042 --> 36:05.375
CHARLES:
Here it comes.

36:05.542 --> 36:06.958
TERRY:
I've seen that crane before.

36:07.083 --> 36:09.292
He's going to perch
right up there.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.958
NARRATOR:
The day that the Oak Island
team has been waiting for

36:12.167 --> 36:13.833
has finally arrived.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.167
TERRY:
There they are.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.292
NARRATOR:
Now that representatives

36:17.458 --> 36:19.833
from Dumas Contracting Limited
have completed

36:20.042 --> 36:24.000
their preparations and amassed
all of their heavy equipment,

36:24.167 --> 36:25.333
they are about
to begin extending

36:25.458 --> 36:27.958
the 82-foot-deep Garden Shaft

36:28.083 --> 36:30.000
by an additional 20 feet

36:30.167 --> 36:31.667
in order to breach a tunnel

36:31.875 --> 36:34.792
that may lead to
the Money Pit treasure vault.

36:34.958 --> 36:36.125
CRAIG:
Gentlemen.

36:36.250 --> 36:37.792
RICK:
I don't know about you guys,

36:37.917 --> 36:39.083
I don't know if you got
the right look going on here.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.500
(laughter)

36:40.667 --> 36:42.208
-Rick, how are you?
-How are you guys?

36:42.375 --> 36:43.750
It's a credit to everyone

36:43.875 --> 36:45.750
that this project
is finally underway.

36:45.875 --> 36:48.167
We are locked in. Locked in.

36:48.333 --> 36:51.333
100% locked in to
the Garden Shaft project,

36:51.500 --> 36:54.500
and we believe that it will
help us solve this thing.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.708
This is a huge endeavor here.

36:56.875 --> 36:59.958
We have significant interest
in this area,

37:00.167 --> 37:02.500
but there's
unfinished business here.

37:02.667 --> 37:05.083
Are we standing on top of the
treasure? We don't know that.

37:05.208 --> 37:07.000
Are we standing
on top of information?

37:07.208 --> 37:08.833
We do believe that.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.333
100%. But the only way to
verify that is with your help.

37:12.542 --> 37:14.083
-That's exactly what it is.
-We're a team. So...

37:14.208 --> 37:16.333
ROGER: Yep. This year
we're really excited

37:16.542 --> 37:18.250
getting down there,
getting back to

37:18.417 --> 37:20.042
where we were
and moving forward.

37:20.208 --> 37:21.667
What are the first steps?

37:21.833 --> 37:23.667
We're gonna
lift this cover right off

37:23.833 --> 37:25.708
and we're gonna set up our pump
and we're gonna start pumping.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.458
-The water is
pretty high in there.
-Was it?

37:27.625 --> 37:29.250
When we get to the bottom,
we'll be ready.

37:29.458 --> 37:30.667
NARRATOR:
Since it was sealed shut

37:30.750 --> 37:33.292
at the surface last winter,

37:33.417 --> 37:36.333
the Garden Shaft has become
filled to the top

37:36.542 --> 37:38.792
with groundwater,
and possibly inflow

37:38.958 --> 37:41.250
from the legendary
booby-trapped flood tunnel

37:41.417 --> 37:43.500
that originates
from Smith's Cove.

37:43.625 --> 37:46.208
While it will take
several days to drain,

37:46.375 --> 37:48.375
the water has actually
helped to preserve

37:48.542 --> 37:50.583
the wood in the structure.

37:50.792 --> 37:52.500
CRAIG:
Well, I'm eager to get down

37:52.708 --> 37:55.042
to the tunnel level,
see what that is.

37:55.208 --> 37:56.458
And to drill out,

37:56.625 --> 37:58.375
and see what we find
from drilling out.

37:58.542 --> 38:00.917
NARRATOR:
Over the coming weeks,

38:01.042 --> 38:03.333
the team from
Dumas Contracting Limited

38:03.500 --> 38:06.542
will use the massive
109-ton crane,

38:06.708 --> 38:08.583
along with a 3-ton hammer grab,

38:08.750 --> 38:10.833
to excavate
the muck and water

38:11.042 --> 38:12.500
from the bottom of the shaft.

38:12.708 --> 38:15.792
Then, they will build
two additional levels,

38:15.958 --> 38:19.458
or sets, down to a depth
of some 100 feet,

38:19.583 --> 38:22.375
breaching the tunnel below it.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.000
Depending on what is discovered,

38:25.167 --> 38:28.583
the Oak Island team will
also be able to probe drill out

38:28.708 --> 38:32.208
as much as 40 feet in
every direction from the shaft

38:32.375 --> 38:34.500
to look for
evidence of valuables.

38:34.708 --> 38:37.000
And, if necessary,
they can construct

38:37.167 --> 38:41.667
new lateral tunnels in order
to recover any verified targets.

38:42.708 --> 38:45.708
We need to get to the bottom
of the Garden Shaft.

38:45.875 --> 38:48.083
We have a potential tunnel
that could be

38:48.250 --> 38:49.833
going to an offset chamber.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.583
There could be treasure
itself right below there.

38:53.708 --> 38:55.458
And there could be things

38:55.625 --> 38:58.292
that were left in there
from a long time ago

38:58.458 --> 39:01.375
that are also
very substantive clues.

39:01.542 --> 39:02.458
So, there's lots of
things that could happen

39:02.625 --> 39:04.250
in the Garden Shaft.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.000
This year we have
a chance to find treasure.

39:07.208 --> 39:09.333
I think we all want to
get down there to the bottom.

39:09.458 --> 39:11.375
-I'll go first!
-(laughter)

39:12.375 --> 39:14.500
You said it right, mate,
unfinished business.

39:14.667 --> 39:18.375
This year we could
get down there and actually

39:18.542 --> 39:20.417
hold shiny gold things
in our hands.

39:20.542 --> 39:23.708
I want to hand these keys
to open this up to Dan Henskee.

39:23.875 --> 39:27.125
We all have immense respect
and admiration

39:27.292 --> 39:29.458
for what Dan has done
almost his entire adult life.

39:29.625 --> 39:32.500
And so, Dan, I'm going
to hand them to you.

39:32.667 --> 39:33.833
-Oh, yeah.
-And I want you to

39:34.000 --> 39:35.292
hand them to Roger,

39:35.500 --> 39:37.292
and we can get this party
started, if you will.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.250
Ooh, don't want to lose these.

39:39.417 --> 39:40.375
(laughter)

39:40.542 --> 39:41.375
RICK:
Dan Henskee,

39:41.542 --> 39:43.500
I've said it many times,

39:43.625 --> 39:46.250
has lived, breathed
and bled Oak Island.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.333
This is what he was meant to do,

39:48.542 --> 39:50.333
and I think to honor him
is the right thing to do.

39:50.542 --> 39:53.250
All right, Dan.
Let's get this puppy open.

39:53.417 --> 39:54.625
Oh, yeah.

39:54.833 --> 39:56.583
I'll get back here
out of the way a little.

39:56.792 --> 39:58.833
GARY:
Time to open Pandora's box.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.208
-BILL: There we go.
-RICK: There you go, yeah.

40:02.375 --> 40:04.667
So, gentlemen,
this is what we're dealing with.

40:04.875 --> 40:06.375
-Oh, boy.
-Wow.
-Wow.

40:06.583 --> 40:08.042
ROGER:
That's what we got, guys.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.667
(team exclaiming)

40:09.875 --> 40:10.625
Well, I'm ready.

40:10.792 --> 40:11.708
(laughter)

40:11.875 --> 40:12.958
Dive in.

40:13.083 --> 40:14.083
Did you hear that?

40:14.208 --> 40:15.417
That's treasure
calling our name.

40:15.583 --> 40:16.875
(laughter)

40:17.042 --> 40:17.875
Treasure, answers,

40:18.042 --> 40:19.583
call it what you will,

40:19.708 --> 40:21.167
but there's something
at the bottom of this shaft.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.458
-Oh, yeah.
-And I think

40:22.625 --> 40:24.958
you are the team
to make it happen.

40:25.125 --> 40:26.708
So, let's get some answers.

40:26.875 --> 40:28.333
-What do you say?
-Absolutely.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.750
-Roger...
-Looking forward to it.

40:29.958 --> 40:31.500
...we're gonna give you
the go-ahead signal.

40:31.583 --> 40:32.750
-You have at her.
You and the team.
-Absolutely.

40:32.875 --> 40:34.292
It won't be long,
we'll get you down there.

40:34.417 --> 40:35.458
Great.

40:35.625 --> 40:37.542
All right, let's go, guys.

40:37.708 --> 40:39.875
-ALEX: All right.
-TERRY: Out we go.
Lead us out, Dan.

40:40.042 --> 40:43.125
NARRATOR:
For brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

40:43.292 --> 40:46.000
and their team, the long wait

40:46.167 --> 40:48.792
to see what lies
beneath the Garden Shaft,

40:48.958 --> 40:52.167
and perhaps in
the original Money Pit,

40:52.333 --> 40:54.917
may finally be nearing an end.

40:55.083 --> 40:57.583
And a dream that has been
collectively shared

40:57.708 --> 41:00.042
by searchers
for more than two centuries...

41:00.208 --> 41:01.625
-RODNEY: Ready?
-ROGER: Good.

41:01.708 --> 41:03.625
NARRATOR:
...could soon be fulfilled.

41:04.625 --> 41:07.417
But if so,
just what is down there

41:07.542 --> 41:10.083
waiting to be revealed?

41:10.250 --> 41:13.250
A vast cache of silver and gold?

41:13.417 --> 41:16.417
Priceless religious artifacts?

41:16.583 --> 41:20.167
On Oak Island,
only one thing is certain.

41:20.333 --> 41:23.042
She fiercely protects

41:23.208 --> 41:26.000
her precious secrets.

41:29.042 --> 41:31.792
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:31.917 --> 41:33.542
MAX:
We're excited to
present the results

41:33.708 --> 41:35.500
from the Muon tomography.
So what we're seeing is

41:35.708 --> 41:39.000
high-density anomaly below
the surface of the Money Pit.

41:39.208 --> 41:41.708
-We think its Aladdin's Cave.
-It could lead to the treasure.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.458
I think I've hit a void.

41:45.583 --> 41:46.792
TERRY:
The plot thickens.

41:46.958 --> 41:49.542
Oh, it's a... Look at that.

41:50.667 --> 41:51.792
RICK:
This is really something.

41:51.917 --> 41:53.333
There are letters stamped on it.

41:53.458 --> 41:55.792
Whoa! It could be very old.

41:55.958 --> 41:57.292
Yeah.
