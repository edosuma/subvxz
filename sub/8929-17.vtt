00:34.005 --> 00:36.972
ANNOUNCER: Last time on Beast Wars...

00:39.473 --> 00:42.039
Attention, Maximals.

00:42.139 --> 00:45.374
This is a code one emergency message from Tigatron.

00:45.474 --> 00:48.507
Airazor has been damaged. She and I are trapped

00:48.607 --> 00:50.907
on a mysterious flying island.

00:51.007 --> 00:54.108
This island is a self-contained ecosystem

00:54.208 --> 00:57.242
guarded by powerful weapons of alien design.

00:57.342 --> 01:00.909
Blackarachnia and Scorponok have already managed to invade.

01:01.009 --> 01:03.843
If they gain control of the island and its weapons,

01:03.943 --> 01:07.844
the Predacons will be able to destroy the Maximal base

01:07.944 --> 01:10.910
and win the Beast Wars.

01:11.011 --> 01:13.144
( static )

01:13.244 --> 01:15.245
( dramatic theme playing )

01:37.315 --> 01:38.982
Ah.

01:39.082 --> 01:42.416
It is as though I have come home.

01:42.516 --> 01:44.950
Though my heart is a Maximal fluid pump,

01:45.050 --> 01:47.784
my soul is that of a tiger.

01:47.884 --> 01:50.617
And on this strange flying island,

01:50.717 --> 01:52.585
despite its weaponry,

01:52.685 --> 01:56.451
I at last feel myself at peace.

01:56.551 --> 02:00.219
It must not fall into the clutches of the Predacons.

02:00.319 --> 02:02.886
( dramatic theme playing )

02:07.320 --> 02:10.488
That obelisk seems to be the center of power

02:10.588 --> 02:14.188
for this whole place.

02:14.288 --> 02:16.855
Then it is probably guarded.

02:16.955 --> 02:19.889
Figured that all out by yourself, did you?

02:19.989 --> 02:21.856
Keep your scanners on high res.

02:21.956 --> 02:24.390
Wait.

02:24.490 --> 02:25.890
There's something here,

02:25.990 --> 02:28.624
some sort of marking.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.991
( yells )

02:32.091 --> 02:34.091
( grunts )

02:35.725 --> 02:38.325
( groans )

02:39.725 --> 02:41.259
Have a nice trip?

02:41.359 --> 02:43.593
( laughs )

02:45.960 --> 02:46.960
( grunts )

02:47.060 --> 02:51.594
There are times it pays to be a spider.

02:51.694 --> 02:53.894
That symbol...

02:53.994 --> 02:57.229
It seems to mark a trap location.

02:57.329 --> 02:58.596
( chuckles )

02:58.695 --> 03:01.996
This could be useful knowledge.

03:05.063 --> 03:06.897
We should move.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.730
How are you feeling?

03:10.830 --> 03:13.264
Better. Still thrashed.

03:13.364 --> 03:14.464
( grunts )

03:14.564 --> 03:17.998
Can't fly.

03:18.098 --> 03:23.066
In that case, the lady shall ride a tiger.

03:31.234 --> 03:33.168
( dramatic theme playing )

03:34.535 --> 03:38.268
Man, I still don't see why I gotta be the one

03:38.368 --> 03:41.136
to get carried like a sack of rusty nuts.

03:41.236 --> 03:44.736
Because you're the only one I can fly this whole distance.

03:44.836 --> 03:46.870
Besides, Tigatron's message said

03:46.970 --> 03:48.570
the flying island was booby-trapped,

03:48.670 --> 03:51.470
and no one knows traps like Rattrap.

03:51.570 --> 03:54.304
Eh, the curse of a great reputation.

03:54.405 --> 03:57.972
Heh, heh. Say, we get beverage cart service on this flight?

03:58.072 --> 04:01.272
Just make sure your seat belt is securely fastened.

04:01.372 --> 04:04.507
RATTRAP: Whoa!

04:04.606 --> 04:07.306
( beeps )

04:07.407 --> 04:11.174
Launching laser probe... Now.

04:20.976 --> 04:22.343
( grunts )

04:22.443 --> 04:24.810
This is Maximal base calling Optimus.

04:24.910 --> 04:26.144
Come in, Optimus.

04:26.243 --> 04:28.010
This is Optimus Primal.

04:28.110 --> 04:30.511
Sounds like the laser link is working fine.

04:30.611 --> 04:32.711
It's line of sight transmission,

04:32.811 --> 04:35.111
but at least it's free of energon interference.

04:35.211 --> 04:36.678
And the infrared beam should go

04:36.779 --> 04:39.079
right through that cover cloud without trouble.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.012
( panting ): Hey, speaking of trouble,

04:41.112 --> 04:44.047
Waspinator and Terrorsaur just took off from Pred central.

04:44.147 --> 04:45.613
They must be back online.

04:45.713 --> 04:47.714
You hear that, Optimus?

04:47.813 --> 04:49.647
OPTIMUS: More than hear it, Rhinox.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.680
We're livin' it live.

04:51.781 --> 04:53.081

04:53.181 --> 04:55.181
Terrorize!

05:00.883 --> 05:02.016

05:02.116 --> 05:03.849

05:06.750 --> 05:09.550
( Terrorsaur shrieks )

05:10.717 --> 05:12.184
( grunts )

05:12.284 --> 05:14.885
I can't maneuver with a passenger.

05:14.985 --> 05:17.818
Huh. Well, excuse me.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.419
I'm the one hangin' on by my little pink toes here.

05:20.519 --> 05:23.486
I can't even transform like this.

05:23.586 --> 05:25.586
( both screaming )

05:35.321 --> 05:37.321
( suspenseful theme playing )

05:38.855 --> 05:42.022
Hold it, shell head. SCORPONOK: Oh!

05:42.122 --> 05:44.056
We want to avoid this area.

05:44.156 --> 05:45.456
( groans )

05:45.556 --> 05:46.689
( clanks )

05:46.790 --> 05:47.890
Why?

05:47.990 --> 05:51.390
Call it intuition.

06:10.294 --> 06:13.494
Blackarachnia seems freaked by that mark on the tree.

06:13.594 --> 06:15.961
A mark? Like that one?

06:16.062 --> 06:17.761
( tense theme playing )

06:17.861 --> 06:19.796
What does it mean?

06:19.896 --> 06:22.163
( rumbling )

06:34.798 --> 06:37.832
I think we just found out.

06:40.899 --> 06:43.599
( screaming )

06:43.699 --> 06:44.833
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:44.933 --> 06:46.933
( Optimus screams )

06:52.435 --> 06:54.234
( squawks )

06:54.334 --> 06:56.435
Rattrap, I'm on my way.

06:58.468 --> 07:00.202
( yells )

07:00.302 --> 07:03.302
Ah! It's slag-heap city. I'm going to die.

07:03.402 --> 07:07.303
I'm slow and pitiful and helpless!

07:09.403 --> 07:10.770
( Terrorsaur laughs )

07:13.604 --> 07:14.771
Huh?

07:14.871 --> 07:15.938
( laughs )

07:16.038 --> 07:18.905
A scared little mousey.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.173
This is just too good to be true.

07:21.272 --> 07:24.039
Ha. You know, beak face,

07:24.139 --> 07:26.273
you're right.

07:26.373 --> 07:29.007
( grunts then screams )

07:29.107 --> 07:30.641
I-- Beast mode.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.641
( squawks )

07:32.741 --> 07:34.175
Unh. Heh!

07:34.275 --> 07:36.408
RATTRAP: Ha-ha!

07:37.809 --> 07:40.809
Just had to get you close enough to hitch a ride.

07:40.909 --> 07:42.409
( laughs )

07:42.509 --> 07:44.409
Now fly, you featherless freak,

07:44.509 --> 07:46.443
or I'll toast your tachyons.

07:46.543 --> 07:48.710
( groans )

( growls )

07:59.579 --> 08:02.512
( groaning )

08:02.612 --> 08:05.646
Finally. Now for Rattrap.

08:05.746 --> 08:06.946
Huh?

08:07.046 --> 08:09.547
Thanks, but I got it handled.

08:09.647 --> 08:10.713
( Terrorsaur groans )

08:10.814 --> 08:15.281
So, uh, what are we hanging around here for?

08:16.548 --> 08:18.348
( Optimus laughs )

08:18.449 --> 08:20.982
You're a real piece of work, Rattrap.

08:21.082 --> 08:24.283
Eh, ain't it the truth?

08:24.383 --> 08:26.583
( rumbling )

08:26.683 --> 08:29.017
TIGATRON: We've activated another of this island's traps.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.651
Can you fly yet?

08:30.751 --> 08:33.217
( panting ): You think I haven't been trying?

08:33.317 --> 08:36.918
Then we have but one dangerous option.

08:37.018 --> 08:38.518
Tigatron, maximize.

08:43.719 --> 08:45.252
Now we must run.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.787
Huh? The Maximals.

08:51.887 --> 08:53.787
It fired on them.

08:53.887 --> 08:57.055
Then quickly, before it can recharge.

08:57.154 --> 08:59.155
( dramatic theme playing )

09:04.422 --> 09:07.956
There. And about time too.

09:15.058 --> 09:17.791
Heads up!

09:17.891 --> 09:20.692
( Terrorsaur laughing ) ( yells )

09:20.792 --> 09:22.659
( grunts )

09:22.759 --> 09:25.059
Unh! Ow.

09:26.693 --> 09:28.094
Beast mode.

09:30.860 --> 09:34.461
Man, you talk about your bumpy flights.

09:36.061 --> 09:38.295
It is good that you have come.

09:38.395 --> 09:40.962
The Predacons have almost reached the obelisk.

09:41.062 --> 09:42.529
We must stop them,

09:42.629 --> 09:45.463
but we must be careful to avoid the traps.

09:45.563 --> 09:47.563
Watch for that symbol.

09:47.663 --> 09:49.797
That marks a trap location.

09:49.897 --> 09:52.397
( grunts )

09:56.898 --> 09:58.731
So I see.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.965
And don't use energy weapons.

10:01.065 --> 10:04.166
This place gets ticked if you do, bomb.

10:04.266 --> 10:06.233
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.266
You mean that whoever built this place

10:08.366 --> 10:10.400
went to all the trouble of making traps

10:10.500 --> 10:11.733
and then marked them,

10:11.834 --> 10:14.568
and it won't let you use energy weapons?

10:14.668 --> 10:16.135
What are you getting at, Rattrap?

10:16.235 --> 10:19.535
I'm saying that this ain't no paradise.

10:19.635 --> 10:21.135
It's a puzzle.

10:21.235 --> 10:23.769
This whole place is designed to attract intelligent species

10:23.869 --> 10:26.736
and then test them.

10:26.837 --> 10:30.270
Test them? Test them for what?

10:30.370 --> 10:33.571
I don't know, bird lady, but I'll tell you this.

10:33.671 --> 10:35.737
Generally speaking, being a guinea pig

10:35.838 --> 10:37.338
ain't exactly a long-term career gig.

10:37.438 --> 10:38.505
You know what I'm saying?

10:38.605 --> 10:42.172
I say we get off of this flying sod bomb.

10:42.272 --> 10:45.072
No. This is a land of peace.

10:45.172 --> 10:47.207
I will protect it.

10:47.307 --> 10:49.607
It won't be a land of peace much longer.

10:49.707 --> 10:50.841
Look.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.941
( dramatic theme playing )

11:09.376 --> 11:11.944
Ah. At last.

11:12.044 --> 11:15.244
The power center must be inside.

11:15.344 --> 11:16.811
We'll have to blast in.

11:16.911 --> 11:18.678
We can't.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.979
If we use energy weapons, it'll blast us.

11:22.079 --> 11:24.946
Ugh. Then we need a diversion.

11:25.046 --> 11:26.580
Mm...

11:28.246 --> 11:30.180
( Blackarachnia laughs )

11:30.280 --> 11:33.414
( beeps )

11:33.514 --> 11:36.582
The fliers will try to take our triumph for their own.

11:36.681 --> 11:39.415
They must be stopped.

11:39.515 --> 11:41.782
I will blow them from the sky.

11:41.882 --> 11:44.316
Oh! Backstabbing bug.

11:44.416 --> 11:45.816
I'll vape you first.

11:45.916 --> 11:48.417
Terrorize!

11:48.517 --> 11:50.283
( laughs )

11:51.650 --> 11:53.650
( both grunt )

11:55.518 --> 11:57.251
Oops.

11:57.351 --> 11:58.618
( both scream )

11:58.718 --> 12:01.085
Pterodactyl idiot.

12:01.185 --> 12:02.385
( Terrorsaur squawks )

12:03.419 --> 12:06.652
Now, before it recharges.

12:14.054 --> 12:15.788
Success.

12:15.888 --> 12:17.855
Hmm.

12:17.955 --> 12:19.955
( mysterious theme playing )

12:24.989 --> 12:28.890
This flying island and all its power

12:28.990 --> 12:31.957
will soon be mine to control.

12:32.057 --> 12:34.058
( laughing )

12:40.125 --> 12:42.126
( Blackarachnia laughing )

12:44.359 --> 12:47.526
( panting ): They've breached the monument.

12:47.626 --> 12:49.627
My wings have recovered.

12:53.494 --> 12:57.094
Oh, man, I hate these glory charges.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.962
What say, gorilla guy?

12:59.062 --> 13:01.562
Any chance of a negotiated settlement?

13:01.662 --> 13:02.796
No.

13:02.896 --> 13:04.462
Battle ready, team.

13:04.562 --> 13:07.063
Maximize.

13:07.163 --> 13:09.163
( dramatic rock theme playing )

13:16.464 --> 13:19.365
It's mine. This island's weapons

13:19.465 --> 13:23.432
will give me the power to defeat even Megatron.

13:23.532 --> 13:29.067
I will destroy the Maximals and rule the Predacons.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.300
Hm?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.734
Uh-uh-uh.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.468
Megatron anticipated your treachery.

13:37.568 --> 13:40.502
That's why I'm along, to eliminate you.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.169
Fool. You fire at this range,

13:43.269 --> 13:45.636
and the explosion will destroy us both.

13:45.736 --> 13:47.503
Heh. No problem.

13:47.603 --> 13:51.070
I'll just get a little distance, and...

13:51.170 --> 13:52.337
( screams )

13:53.971 --> 13:55.171
( Scorponok grunts )

13:55.271 --> 13:56.304
( laughs )

13:56.404 --> 13:59.371
Make that a lot of distance, chitin cheeks.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.539
( screaming )

14:05.506 --> 14:08.373
Now for power.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.640
( suspenseful theme playing )

14:33.477 --> 14:37.512
BLACKARACHNIA: This must be the control center.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.445
But how do I...?

14:44.246 --> 14:45.779
Oh...

14:49.013 --> 14:51.013
( screaming )

14:53.313 --> 14:55.314
( growls )

14:55.414 --> 14:57.314
Yes.

14:57.414 --> 14:58.715
Yes!

14:58.815 --> 15:01.681
I feel the power.

15:08.283 --> 15:11.350
I have the controls.

15:11.450 --> 15:14.284
Let there be...

15:14.384 --> 15:16.384
light.

15:16.484 --> 15:18.484
( dramatic theme playing )

15:34.787 --> 15:36.521
Huh? Uh-oh.

15:50.490 --> 15:52.290
( yells )

15:53.590 --> 15:54.790
( grunts )

15:59.658 --> 16:01.725
( Blackarachnia laughing )

16:05.592 --> 16:09.760
All speed to the Maximal base.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.860
( dramatic theme playing )

16:33.330 --> 16:35.764
Rhinox, code one emergency.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.098
Evacuate Maximal base.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.632
Scramble. Scramble.

16:41.865 --> 16:43.865
( alarm blaring )

17:05.202 --> 17:06.636
( both yell )

17:06.736 --> 17:10.036
( both grunt )

17:10.136 --> 17:12.503
This is something that should not have happened.

17:12.603 --> 17:15.671
You get no argument from me.

17:15.771 --> 17:17.071
( missile approaches )

17:17.170 --> 17:18.305
( both grunt )

17:18.404 --> 17:19.771
Ow! Rattrap.

17:19.871 --> 17:22.338
No. Get moving.

17:22.438 --> 17:24.505
You got to get in there, or we're all scrap.

17:24.605 --> 17:27.573
But the defenses. And your leg.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.907
Hey, leave it to the rat.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.940
I'll handle it. You just run!

17:38.408 --> 17:39.608
( Rattrap groans )

17:39.708 --> 17:42.276
Listen up, you oversized thumbtack.

17:42.375 --> 17:45.042
Try a little taste of this.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.477
( power surges )

17:50.510 --> 17:53.011
( screams then grunts )

17:53.110 --> 17:54.844
( rattles )

17:54.944 --> 17:57.278
Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

17:58.811 --> 18:01.345
Yes! Do it, Tigatron.

18:01.445 --> 18:04.579
Maximal base almost in range.

18:04.679 --> 18:06.679
( dramatic theme playing )

18:07.812 --> 18:11.180
BLACKARACHNIA: Five, four, three...

18:12.247 --> 18:14.581
May I be forgiven

18:14.681 --> 18:16.381
for what I must do.

18:23.515 --> 18:25.515
( electricity crackling )

18:26.116 --> 18:28.149
What? No!

18:28.249 --> 18:30.083
No!

18:30.184 --> 18:31.917
( dramatic theme playing )

18:32.017 --> 18:33.950
OPTIMUS: Yeah.

18:51.353 --> 18:54.554
BLACKARACHNIA: No!

19:28.860 --> 19:30.359
Whoa.

19:30.459 --> 19:33.494
What do you suppose that beam was all about?

19:33.594 --> 19:35.027
Some kind of signal?

19:35.127 --> 19:37.261
A message.

19:37.361 --> 19:39.795
We were given a paradise.

19:39.894 --> 19:44.029
All we had to do was live there in peace.

19:44.129 --> 19:46.496
But we proved unworthy.

19:49.696 --> 19:53.463
And the paradise is no more.

19:53.564 --> 19:55.664
Yeah.

19:55.764 --> 19:58.131
It's an old story.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.464
Maybe someday we'll learn.

20:00.565 --> 20:05.065
Yeah, well, pardon my pragmatism here in this,

20:05.165 --> 20:07.732
you know, deeply philosophical moment,

20:07.832 --> 20:09.767
but I'm a little more concerned about

20:09.866 --> 20:12.034
who got that message.

20:12.134 --> 20:15.401
Because you gotta know they ain't gonna be real happy.

20:15.501 --> 20:18.601
What do you think they're going to do?

20:18.701 --> 20:23.569
That we're just going to have to wait and see.

20:23.669 --> 20:25.669
( mysterious theme playing )

20:49.406 --> 20:51.206
( dramatic theme playing )
