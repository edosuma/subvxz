WEBVTT

00:54.022 --> 00:55.523
Come here.

01:00.195 --> 01:01.487
You know me?

01:01.571 --> 01:02.863
Everyone knows you.

01:05.408 --> 01:06.451
You know Young Jun?

01:09.829 --> 01:11.622
Tell him it's time.

01:13.499 --> 01:14.584
Go.

01:42.653 --> 01:44.655
What's going on here?

01:55.375 --> 01:56.584
Hey, how's it going?

02:02.840 --> 02:04.169
You guys seem to have
wandered off

02:04.259 --> 02:05.593
Long Zii territory.

02:05.676 --> 02:06.844
It's okay.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.304
We all get turned around
now and then.

02:09.264 --> 02:11.307
I'd be happy to point you
in the right direction.

02:11.391 --> 02:13.393
You're the one who's
turned around, motherfucker.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.021
Wow, you escalated that
pretty fast.

02:16.104 --> 02:17.730
Usually there's
a little more repartee,

02:17.813 --> 02:18.731
a few zingers

02:18.814 --> 02:20.108
before the hatchets come out,
you know?

02:20.185 --> 02:21.401
Walk away, asshole.

02:22.777 --> 02:25.780
We fought the ducks together
for one day.

02:25.863 --> 02:27.823
Now Mai Ling thinks she can
just set up opium dens

02:27.907 --> 02:29.284
in Hop Wei territory?

02:29.367 --> 02:31.077
That's against the treaty.

02:31.161 --> 02:34.830
And, you know,
basic common sense.

02:34.914 --> 02:38.168
So take your molasses,
get the fuck out of here,

02:38.251 --> 02:39.460
or I'll take it,

02:39.544 --> 02:41.129
and then you'll have to explain
to Mai Ling

02:41.206 --> 02:44.590
how you lost your opium
and got your asses kicked.

02:52.098 --> 02:53.516
Huh.

02:55.726 --> 02:57.687
Still gonna feed you
that hatchet in three seconds.

02:57.770 --> 02:58.771
Listen to me,
you dumb fuck...

02:58.854 --> 02:59.940
- Two.
- I don't know what you think

03:00.023 --> 03:00.982
- is gonna happen here.
- One.

03:01.066 --> 03:02.025
It's not gonna end well.

04:11.469 --> 04:13.096
- All right, let's go, boys!
- Yeah!

04:13.179 --> 04:14.930
Let's go get 'em!

04:15.015 --> 04:16.724
Now, boys. Let's go!

04:16.807 --> 04:17.933
Come on.

05:43.853 --> 05:44.980
Hey, how's it going?

05:45.063 --> 05:46.356
You know there's a door
right there.

05:46.439 --> 05:48.024
Shut up and help me up.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.484
San Francisco police!

07:54.567 --> 07:56.027
Stand down!

08:04.785 --> 08:06.079
Hey!

08:06.162 --> 08:07.080
Get up!

08:10.708 --> 08:14.212
Police! Hold your ground!
Hold your ground!

08:14.295 --> 08:15.713
Ah Sahm!

08:15.796 --> 08:17.715
Don't move.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.425
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

08:22.095 --> 08:23.638
It's not my hands
you have to worry about.

08:24.930 --> 08:26.266
Yeah?

08:26.349 --> 08:29.185
You think you can kick
faster than a 12-gauge?

08:31.521 --> 08:33.439
They finally put this place
back together,

08:33.523 --> 08:34.983
and you and the Long Zii are
out here

08:35.066 --> 08:36.026
tearing it apart again.

08:36.109 --> 08:38.819
You're the one coming in here
every day with an army of cops,

08:38.903 --> 08:40.071
busting heads.

08:40.155 --> 08:41.781
Because it's fucking chaos
here.

08:41.864 --> 08:44.569
Only since you cops started
cracking down in Chinatown.

08:44.659 --> 08:46.369
Hey, I was here
during that riot

08:46.452 --> 08:48.038
trying to keep
your people safe.

08:48.121 --> 08:51.416
We don't need you
to keep us safe.

08:51.499 --> 08:53.168
We need you to stay the hell
out of our business.

08:53.709 --> 08:54.961
Tong business.

08:55.045 --> 08:56.629
I mean every business
the cops have shut down

08:56.712 --> 08:58.756
with these bullshit ordinances.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.050
People are starving.

09:00.508 --> 09:02.718
And how are your turf wars
gonna feed them?

09:03.761 --> 09:05.346
Fuck's sake!

09:07.265 --> 09:08.224
Get the fuck out of here.

09:12.395 --> 09:13.688
Little shit.

09:15.731 --> 09:18.318
Stone, no shooting!
We're pulling out.

09:18.401 --> 09:20.111
- What are you talking about?
- Fight's over.

09:20.195 --> 09:21.606
We're not here
to start it up again.

09:21.696 --> 09:24.449
Come on! Let's fall back!

09:24.532 --> 09:25.866
Fuck, Bill.

09:26.784 --> 09:27.994
Something on your mind?

09:28.995 --> 09:30.580
Ever since
the chief kicked it,

09:30.663 --> 09:32.290
you've had your eye
on his damn job.

09:32.373 --> 09:35.043
And you're tying our fucking
hands behind our backs.

09:36.002 --> 09:37.963
You sure you wanna speak
to the new chief that way?

09:39.464 --> 09:40.590
You're not him yet.

11:26.731 --> 11:29.532
And where is Mr. Greer? Hmm?

11:30.783 --> 11:31.993
Hey, Greer!

11:36.081 --> 11:37.248
Greer!

11:54.682 --> 11:56.101
Mr. Greer.

11:56.184 --> 11:58.186
So good to see you again.

12:01.766 --> 12:04.234
- 100 for the lot?
- As agreed.

12:06.652 --> 12:07.946
They look kinda old.

12:08.029 --> 12:09.905
100, you get old.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.824
200, you get new.

12:11.907 --> 12:14.410
I say this. You choose 100.

12:15.536 --> 12:16.537
I know what I chose.

12:17.122 --> 12:18.539
I just wanna make sure
they work.

12:18.623 --> 12:20.250
I test all myself.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.917
Oh, yeah?

12:22.002 --> 12:23.753
And I'm supposed to take
your word for it?

12:31.552 --> 12:32.428
Hey.

12:32.512 --> 12:34.930
"Hey" what?

12:35.015 --> 12:37.475
Think anyone's gonna miss
one uppity Chinaman?

12:39.727 --> 12:41.271
You got something to say?

12:43.856 --> 12:45.525
One...

12:45.608 --> 12:47.193
hundred...

12:47.277 --> 12:48.694
dollar.

12:55.493 --> 12:58.038
You're one ballsy Chinaman,
I'll give you that.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.086
"One hundred dollar."

13:14.929 --> 13:16.681
Now get the fuck out of here.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.961
[in Cantonese]
These fucking bulls.

13:46.044 --> 13:47.920
Suddenly you can't throw a stick
in Chinatown

13:48.004 --> 13:49.797
without hitting one.

13:50.131 --> 13:53.051
[in English]
Used to be the Chinatown squad was a joke.

13:53.134 --> 13:55.178
Now they got half the police
force cracking skulls.

13:55.261 --> 13:56.387
It's all politics.

13:56.471 --> 13:59.682
Ducks are just trying to look
tough before the election.

14:01.851 --> 14:02.978
Yeah, but why
they gotta shut down

14:03.061 --> 14:04.645
all my favorite spots, though?

14:04.729 --> 14:06.689
I finally find
a decent egg tart,

14:06.772 --> 14:09.359
and bang,
Mr. Gaoyuan is gone, man.

14:09.442 --> 14:11.069
Meanwhile, Mai Ling breaks
the treaty

14:11.152 --> 14:12.362
and we can't even retaliate

14:12.445 --> 14:13.989
because of all
these damn bulls.

14:14.072 --> 14:17.658
We're losing protection money
and we're losing guys.

14:17.742 --> 14:20.745
Either we find a way
to dodge these ordinances

14:20.828 --> 14:22.998
- or we're fucked.
- Yeah.

14:38.179 --> 14:40.806
Young Jun.

14:40.890 --> 14:42.767
I am, uh, honored.

14:42.850 --> 14:46.896
And I am, uh, pissed off.

14:46.980 --> 14:49.190
I'm only here because my men
have come up empty-handed

14:49.274 --> 14:50.566
two weeks in a row.

14:50.650 --> 14:52.860
I know, and I'm sorry,

14:52.937 --> 14:56.031
but the bulls shut us down
twice in the last month.

14:56.114 --> 14:57.657
These are tough times
for all of us.

14:57.740 --> 15:00.368
But that doesn't absolve us
of our debts.

15:00.451 --> 15:03.871
I'm happy to pay
for the protection, but...

15:03.949 --> 15:06.791
I don't see
that we're protected now.

15:06.874 --> 15:08.918
Do you really wanna talk
to me like that?

15:09.002 --> 15:11.129
I don't have the money
to pay you.

15:11.212 --> 15:13.881
I'm just telling you how it is.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.092
Your father would've
understood.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.097
My father isn't
running things anymore.

15:21.181 --> 15:22.390
I am.

15:22.473 --> 15:23.558
So if I were you, I'd leave him

15:23.641 --> 15:25.185
the fuck out
of this conversation.

15:25.268 --> 15:26.727
If he could see you now...

15:26.811 --> 15:28.063
This fucking onion.

15:28.146 --> 15:29.314
Hey, let's--

15:29.397 --> 15:31.977
let's let Hong handle this,
huh?

15:32.067 --> 15:34.069
It's okay. You're the boss.

15:34.152 --> 15:36.779
You shouldn't be collecting
anyway...

15:39.907 --> 15:42.410
Boss.

15:42.493 --> 15:44.204
You better watch the way
you fucking talk to me,

15:44.287 --> 15:46.206
old man.

15:57.883 --> 15:59.094
Handle it.

16:00.761 --> 16:02.722
Young Jun. Hey, hey.

16:03.473 --> 16:04.807
What the fuck was that?

16:05.600 --> 16:06.601
What?

16:06.684 --> 16:09.062
Getting in my way like that!

16:09.145 --> 16:10.438
You were beating
on an old man.

16:10.521 --> 16:13.066
I was making a fucking point.

16:13.149 --> 16:14.484
He disrespected me.

16:14.567 --> 16:16.361
You want respect,

16:16.444 --> 16:18.446
you're not gonna get it by
flying off the fucking handle.

16:19.822 --> 16:22.742
Don't you ever challenge me
in public again.

16:27.913 --> 16:30.250
It's getting dangerous
out there.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.459
Fuck.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.628
The bulls are coming
in larger numbers,

16:33.711 --> 16:37.090
shutting down businesses,
damaging our property.

16:37.173 --> 16:39.467
Our unity might be
the only weapon we have

16:39.550 --> 16:40.635
against this enemy.

16:41.886 --> 16:44.049
The Jiang Yao Tong
has always enjoyed

16:44.139 --> 16:46.641
a friendship with the Long Zii.

16:46.724 --> 16:49.769
But the truth is,
the more tongs there are,

16:49.852 --> 16:52.188
the more we are divided.

16:52.272 --> 16:55.525
And so as you asked

16:55.608 --> 16:58.819
and under the terms
you stipulated,

16:58.903 --> 17:03.324
the Jiang Yao Tong are honored
to become part of the Long Zii.

17:09.539 --> 17:13.793
We pledge our blades,
our blood,

17:13.876 --> 17:17.547
and our souls to the Long Zii
and to its leader,

17:17.630 --> 17:19.049
Mai Ling.

17:27.390 --> 17:28.933
Kong Pak.

17:37.483 --> 17:39.860
After leading a tong
for so long,

17:39.945 --> 17:42.197
I'm sure this was not
an easy decision.

17:43.281 --> 17:45.075
It wasn't.

17:45.158 --> 17:47.953
But when you're given
no choice,

17:48.036 --> 17:50.288
the choice becomes clear.

17:55.626 --> 17:58.629
Li Yong tells me
you're a great warrior...

18:00.506 --> 18:02.127
And an honorable man.

18:04.844 --> 18:07.597
I hope you will sit
on my council with the elders.

18:13.103 --> 18:14.729
It would be my honor.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.738
Well, then...

18:29.077 --> 18:30.786
Welcome to the Long Zii.

19:05.488 --> 19:07.907
I am Irish. Dublin-born.

19:07.991 --> 19:10.493
And it pains me,
as I'm sure it does

19:10.576 --> 19:13.496
everyone on this council,
to be unable

19:13.579 --> 19:15.790
to hire Irish labor.

19:15.873 --> 19:18.543
But with lumber prices
bleeding me dry,

19:18.626 --> 19:21.671
I just don't have the margins.

19:21.754 --> 19:24.299
If you don't have the margins
to pay a living wage,

19:24.382 --> 19:26.259
you're doing something wrong.

19:26.342 --> 19:28.261
It's a wage
the Chinese can live on.

19:28.344 --> 19:31.014
A dog could live on it too,
but that doesn't make it right.

19:31.097 --> 19:32.432
Mr. Leary,
we've been through this.

19:32.515 --> 19:34.309
If you would simply study
the economics--

19:34.392 --> 19:35.851
I understand the economics.

19:35.935 --> 19:38.479
Well, then why don't you
explain them to me?

19:38.563 --> 19:41.399
Because clearly, we're seeing
the numbers differently.

19:48.614 --> 19:50.575
I'll give you a number.

19:50.658 --> 19:52.702
25,000.

19:52.785 --> 19:54.329
What's that?

19:54.412 --> 19:56.241
That's how many chinks
there are in this city.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.834
And not a single damn one
of them can vote.

20:02.087 --> 20:04.172
Now...

20:04.249 --> 20:05.298
do you happen to know

20:05.381 --> 20:08.009
how many Irish there are
in San Francisco?

20:08.093 --> 20:09.344
I have no idea.

20:09.427 --> 20:11.721
Well, Mr. Buckley does.

20:11.804 --> 20:14.259
He's got that special election
to win.

20:14.349 --> 20:17.435
And I got 30,000 votes he needs
to do it.

20:17.518 --> 20:18.644
How many votes do you have?

20:18.728 --> 20:20.771
Mr. Leary, you've been
on this council long enough

20:20.855 --> 20:23.733
to know we all want
the Chinese gone, but given--

20:23.816 --> 20:25.568
But that won't stop you all

20:25.651 --> 20:27.195
from making
every last buck you can

20:27.272 --> 20:28.488
while they're still here.

20:28.571 --> 20:32.117
If I could show you what I am
paying for steel and lumber--

20:32.200 --> 20:33.743
So negotiate
with your suppliers!

20:33.826 --> 20:35.578
You think I haven't?
It's all I do!

20:35.661 --> 20:36.955
Enough.

20:37.038 --> 20:38.706
We're going round in circles.

20:40.285 --> 20:42.793
That's because no one ever says
anything new.

20:42.877 --> 20:45.130
Welcome to politics,
Mr. Leary.

20:45.213 --> 20:47.007
Now, I move to adjourn.

20:47.090 --> 20:48.508
Seconded.

20:48.591 --> 20:49.800
Fuck.

20:51.136 --> 20:52.470
I've got seniority.

20:52.553 --> 20:55.390
And Flannagan himself
recommended me for the position

20:55.473 --> 20:56.557
before he passed.

20:56.641 --> 20:58.476
So what's Mr. Buckley
waiting for?

20:58.559 --> 21:00.020
He needs a police chief,
doesn't he?

21:00.103 --> 21:03.023
I think he's just
sorting himself out.

21:03.106 --> 21:06.567
He's focused on keeping
his own job right now.

21:06.651 --> 21:08.611
He practically gave you
the keys to the city

21:08.694 --> 21:10.571
when you arrested
that swordsman.

21:10.655 --> 21:13.491
It will happen,
and when it does,

21:13.574 --> 21:15.910
I will be out of Chinatown
for good.

21:20.206 --> 21:21.624
I miss you.

21:25.003 --> 21:26.837
I miss my family.

21:31.176 --> 21:32.385
Please come home.

21:39.517 --> 21:42.562
Get out of Chinatown,
and we can talk about it.

21:49.194 --> 21:52.613
Molly. Michael.
Cut it out right now.

21:54.865 --> 21:55.700
Some whiskey, Bill?

21:58.995 --> 22:00.413
Thank you.

22:03.458 --> 22:04.417
And how did that go?

22:06.169 --> 22:08.004
Okay, I think.

22:12.217 --> 22:13.509
And the chief job?

22:14.885 --> 22:16.929
- Any day now.
- Excellent.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.475
Well, you have
a wonderful family,

22:20.558 --> 22:22.102
but it's a large one.

22:22.185 --> 22:24.437
And I would love to get
these people out of my house.

22:26.356 --> 22:28.566
Michael, stop doing that
to your sister.

22:28.649 --> 22:30.901
Molly, look after your brother.

22:31.902 --> 22:33.654
Headed back to Sonoma?

22:33.738 --> 22:34.948
Just a weekend trip.

22:36.574 --> 22:38.284
So is someone running
the place while you're gone,

22:38.368 --> 22:41.037
or is it on the honor system?

22:41.121 --> 22:43.748
Chao will keep an eye
on things.

22:43.831 --> 22:46.042
- Chao?
- Mm-hmm.

22:47.710 --> 22:50.255
Yeah, and who is keeping
an eye on him?

22:55.510 --> 22:57.845
Feels like you're gone more
than you're here these days.

22:57.928 --> 22:59.264
Miss me?

23:01.182 --> 23:02.642
Things are getting worse
out there.

23:03.559 --> 23:05.811
I'm of no use to you
right now.

23:09.899 --> 23:11.026
How's the shoulder?

23:11.859 --> 23:14.820
Mm, I'm starting to be able
to move it again.

23:16.614 --> 23:18.116
How are things at the Hop Wei?

23:18.199 --> 23:20.035
Not great.

23:20.118 --> 23:21.327
And Young Jun?

23:25.331 --> 23:27.452
Doesn't take a lot
to set him off these days.

23:28.168 --> 23:30.045
Doing what I can
to keep him on point.

23:30.128 --> 23:32.088
If Young Jun can't
find his way as a leader,

23:32.172 --> 23:33.923
there's nothing you can do
about it.

23:34.007 --> 23:37.010
Some things are beyond
even your control.

23:37.093 --> 23:39.554
Yeah, maybe I should just
start leaving town with you.

23:40.465 --> 23:42.265
There's plenty of room
in the carriage.

24:01.486 --> 24:03.369
Mai Ling.

24:03.453 --> 24:05.746
Mr. Buckley.

24:05.830 --> 24:08.166
How goes the campaign?

24:08.249 --> 24:10.293
Running for a position
I already have,

24:10.376 --> 24:12.837
it's a tricky business.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.172
You mean democracy.

24:14.255 --> 24:15.548
Politics.

24:15.631 --> 24:18.134
Glad-handing. Crowd-pleasing.
It's not in my nature.

24:18.218 --> 24:20.095
I'm sure.

24:20.178 --> 24:21.929
You know, if it helps,

24:22.013 --> 24:24.557
an old Chinese philosopher
once said,

24:24.640 --> 24:26.226
"No one is ever defeated

24:26.309 --> 24:28.936
until defeat has been accepted
as reality."

24:29.020 --> 24:31.064
Thank you. It doesn't.

24:32.565 --> 24:34.567
You caused quite a fracas
the other day.

24:35.693 --> 24:37.028
It was a misunderstanding.

24:37.112 --> 24:40.448
You were making a move
into Hop Wei territory.

24:40.525 --> 24:42.325
I'm keeping the police
off your back

24:42.408 --> 24:44.285
as per our arrangement,

24:44.369 --> 24:45.745
but expanding your operations

24:45.828 --> 24:47.247
was never part
of the agreement.

24:47.330 --> 24:49.707
Then I'll change
our agreement.

24:49.790 --> 24:51.536
You offered me
some Chinese wisdom.

24:51.626 --> 24:54.420
I will offer you some American.

24:54.504 --> 24:55.755
Benjamin Franklin said,

24:55.838 --> 24:58.008
"Necessity never made
a good bargain."

24:58.091 --> 25:00.343
You might think you have me
at a disadvantage

25:00.426 --> 25:03.548
with that
incriminating photograph,

25:03.638 --> 25:05.265
but there's only so far
you can push me

25:05.348 --> 25:09.144
before I decide your leverage
isn't worth the price.

25:11.021 --> 25:13.148
No more moves.

25:13.231 --> 25:16.943
No more violence of any kind
until after the election.

25:17.485 --> 25:18.611
Understood.

25:20.113 --> 25:22.240
Believe me,

25:22.323 --> 25:24.909
the Long Zii greatly value
our relationship

25:24.993 --> 25:27.120
with the mayor
of San Francisco.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.293
For your campaign.

25:37.463 --> 25:41.176
If the glad-handing ever gets
to be too much,

25:41.259 --> 25:43.928
just do what I do.

25:44.012 --> 25:46.639
Imagine your knife
in their throat.

26:01.154 --> 26:03.864
Here you go, boys.

26:03.949 --> 26:05.908
We closed our tab.

26:05.992 --> 26:07.327
This round's on me.

26:07.953 --> 26:09.412
Charity?

26:09.495 --> 26:11.164
It's just a round, Killy.

26:12.082 --> 26:14.292
Wouldn't need your round
if we were working.

26:16.086 --> 26:18.254
I thought the idea of you
joining the city council

26:18.338 --> 26:21.382
was to get rid of the Chinese
and get us all working again.

26:21.466 --> 26:24.629
What the fuck do you think
I'm doing?

26:24.719 --> 26:26.262
You think I like
sitting 'round a table

26:26.346 --> 26:28.139
with those fat fucks
talking down to me?

26:30.058 --> 26:32.102
I can't just force them
to write new laws.

26:34.062 --> 26:36.439
Listen.

26:36.522 --> 26:38.733
It's like anything else, right?

26:38.816 --> 26:40.068
You find the pressure points,

26:40.151 --> 26:42.695
and then you dig
your thumbs in.

26:42.778 --> 26:44.530
These things take time.

26:44.614 --> 26:46.366
Ooh, careful there.

26:46.449 --> 26:49.535
You're even starting to sound
like a politician.

26:50.370 --> 26:52.705
You're an asshole
when you're drunk, Killy.

26:52.788 --> 26:54.832
And a cunt when I'm sober.

27:00.296 --> 27:02.173
Whiskey, three glasses.

27:02.257 --> 27:04.467
- Anything else?
- That's all.

27:04.550 --> 27:07.428
What time is it?

27:07.512 --> 27:08.929
Bedtime.

27:09.014 --> 27:10.556
Earn your keep, baby.

27:13.726 --> 27:15.853
Hey!

27:15.936 --> 27:17.438
- You all right?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

27:18.606 --> 27:20.316
Hey! Come here.

27:24.029 --> 27:25.238
Hey!

27:26.990 --> 27:29.117
Get the fuck off me!

27:29.200 --> 27:31.369
Hey, what are you doing?
He's robbing me!

27:31.452 --> 27:33.079
It's nine drinks
between the two of you,

27:33.163 --> 27:34.414
plus everything you broke.

27:34.497 --> 27:36.082
He didn't pay
for his fucking drinks.

27:36.166 --> 27:37.458
So take that up with him!

27:37.542 --> 27:40.753
Now, I see you in here again,

27:40.836 --> 27:42.880
I'ma hang you up
like Mama's wet washing.

27:42.964 --> 27:44.465
What?

27:44.549 --> 27:45.841
Just go.

27:47.593 --> 27:49.679
- Asshole!
- My hero.

27:56.436 --> 27:59.064
Just keeping the peace.

28:00.481 --> 28:01.816
- Richard?

28:12.577 --> 28:14.620
Bad one?

28:14.704 --> 28:17.040
Um, not--not too bad.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.188
What the fuck is this?

28:52.908 --> 28:55.911
Standard hatchet,
bevel blade, U.S. steel.

28:55.996 --> 28:57.872
The Long Zii use these.

28:57.956 --> 28:59.249
And you make it for them.

28:59.332 --> 29:00.959
I didn't make this.

29:01.042 --> 29:02.377
But you do deal with them.

29:02.460 --> 29:04.254
- Hatchets?
- The Long Zii.

29:05.713 --> 29:07.132
I deal with a lot of people.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.009
Hmm.

29:11.011 --> 29:13.798
You sit here drinking
like you're one of us,

29:13.888 --> 29:17.642
but tomorrow, you might sell
the blade that kills me.

29:17.725 --> 29:21.229
Or I might save your life.

29:21.312 --> 29:22.981
Your father understood
the value

29:23.064 --> 29:25.691
of an independent contractor
with his ear to the streets.

29:25.775 --> 29:29.779
My father valued loyalty
above all.

29:29.862 --> 29:31.072
And so do I.

29:35.118 --> 29:38.955
At some point, you're gonna
have to choose a side.

29:50.466 --> 29:53.678
You know, Zing said
the exact same thing to me.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.599
Ask for my help,
and I will happily give it.

30:01.019 --> 30:04.147
But don't threaten me.

30:04.230 --> 30:05.850
Doesn't work.

30:14.699 --> 30:17.160
- Something up?
- I don't trust him.

30:17.243 --> 30:20.121
It's Chao.
You pay and he delivers.

30:20.205 --> 30:22.415
And that's what you trust.

30:22.498 --> 30:24.084
Cause and effect, right?

30:24.167 --> 30:25.418
It's very Buddhist.

30:25.501 --> 30:27.212
You a Buddhist?

30:27.295 --> 30:28.921
Fuck no.

30:29.005 --> 30:30.715
Come on, boss.

30:30.798 --> 30:33.969
You here to fuck with Chao
or to get some sticky?

30:36.762 --> 30:38.181
Hey.

30:49.442 --> 30:52.487
- What was that?
- Just the new boss flexing.

30:52.570 --> 30:54.530
Think he's starting
to get paranoid.

30:54.614 --> 30:55.656
This business about Mai Ling

30:55.740 --> 30:57.242
being your sister
isn't helping matters.

30:57.325 --> 30:58.868
I mean,
what'd you think would happen?

30:58.952 --> 31:00.996
I just didn't figure
she would tell him.

31:01.079 --> 31:02.663
It was a cold and reckless

31:02.747 --> 31:05.500
and ultimately brilliant move
on her part.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.002
Classic Mai Ling.

31:07.085 --> 31:08.836
I think he's still worried
about it.

31:08.913 --> 31:09.963
He should be.

31:12.007 --> 31:13.758
Chao, I am loyal to the tong.

31:13.841 --> 31:16.011
You crossed the salt
to find her.

31:16.094 --> 31:18.429
And she ordered my death.

31:18.513 --> 31:20.265
Family can be complicated.

31:21.016 --> 31:22.600
- Look, if you ask me...
- I didn't.

31:22.683 --> 31:25.186
I don't see you moving
against your own sister,

31:25.270 --> 31:26.604
and neither does Young Jun.

31:27.147 --> 31:28.481
You've gotta keep an eye
on him.

31:28.564 --> 31:30.733
He's not his father.

31:30.816 --> 31:31.776
He goes off the wrong way,

31:31.859 --> 31:34.070
he could bring down
the whole tong.

31:34.154 --> 31:36.531
We might not have to wait
that long.

31:36.614 --> 31:38.324
The bulls are bleeding us dry.

31:38.408 --> 31:40.118
We don't have the chop
to pay for our molasses,

31:40.201 --> 31:42.620
and now Happy Jack won't
release the product.

31:42.703 --> 31:44.372
None of which reflects well
on the new boss.

31:44.455 --> 31:46.082
I get it. Hmm.

31:51.087 --> 31:53.006
I may be able to help.

31:54.257 --> 31:55.961
Yeah?

31:56.051 --> 31:58.594
I delivered some shooters
to these guys on the docks.

31:58.678 --> 32:01.056
While I was there, I saw cash.

32:01.139 --> 32:02.307
Piles of it.

32:02.390 --> 32:03.766
We're not thieves, Chao.

32:03.849 --> 32:06.811
Now is exactly the wrong time
to get proud.

32:06.894 --> 32:10.231
Now is the time to adapt
or die.

32:19.824 --> 32:21.159
Sergeant O'Hara.

32:23.619 --> 32:24.745
May I have a moment?

32:26.164 --> 32:28.666
Of course, Mr. Mayor.

32:38.426 --> 32:40.386
I know you've been waiting
for news

32:40.470 --> 32:42.763
ever since Chief Flannagan
passed away,

32:42.847 --> 32:44.724
and I appreciate your patience.

32:44.807 --> 32:46.476
Of course, sir.

32:46.559 --> 32:50.896
I know conventional wisdom
has you next in line for chief.

32:52.565 --> 32:57.195
But based on a number
of extenuating factors...

32:58.321 --> 33:00.240
I'm afraid I've had to go
another way.

33:01.157 --> 33:02.492
Another way?

33:03.243 --> 33:06.412
I expect you to be
a professional about this.

33:14.170 --> 33:16.672
Sergeant O'Hara,
meet Colonel Benjamin Atwood,

33:16.756 --> 33:18.967
our new chief of police.

33:19.044 --> 33:21.011
Sergeant.

33:24.597 --> 33:26.182
I'm sorry.

33:26.266 --> 33:27.600
Who the hell is this?

33:27.683 --> 33:30.603
Chief Atwood comes to us
from New York City,

33:30.686 --> 33:32.147
where he was
extremely successful

33:32.230 --> 33:34.565
in bringing to bear
his military experience,

33:34.649 --> 33:37.693
as well as the law,
to clean up their Chinatown.

33:37.777 --> 33:39.779
San Francisco is
nothing like New York.

33:39.862 --> 33:41.031
No.

33:41.114 --> 33:45.368
But the Chinese are the Chinese
everywhere, aren't they?

33:47.120 --> 33:50.415
Mr. Gumm, why don't you show
the chief to his new office?

33:50.498 --> 33:52.542
I'm sure he'd like
to get started right away.

34:04.554 --> 34:06.514
That job was mine.

34:06.597 --> 34:08.599
Only in your mind.

34:10.810 --> 34:12.812
I'm facing an election,

34:12.895 --> 34:14.897
and a significant pillar
of my platform

34:14.981 --> 34:17.192
is bringing order to Chinatown.

34:17.275 --> 34:19.152
And that riot left
our citizens shaken,

34:19.235 --> 34:20.570
wondering how vulnerable
they are

34:20.653 --> 34:22.613
to savage foreigners
living in their midst.

34:22.697 --> 34:25.408
And I am the one
who brought order to that riot.

34:25.491 --> 34:26.784
Maybe.

34:26.867 --> 34:28.578
But I would argue
that the entire thing happened

34:28.661 --> 34:30.830
because you failed to transport
a single prisoner--

34:30.913 --> 34:33.624
the man who murdered our mayor,
I might add.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.251
It's not as simple as that,
and you know it.

34:35.335 --> 34:36.711
The voters
don't want excuses.

34:36.794 --> 34:38.088
They want results.

34:38.171 --> 34:39.880
And Atwood gets results.

34:39.965 --> 34:41.341
He will tear Chinatown apart

34:41.424 --> 34:43.259
and put the fear of God
into those heathens.

34:43.343 --> 34:45.761
He's an outsider.
These are my men.

34:45.845 --> 34:47.680
You can't expect them
to just follow him.

34:47.763 --> 34:49.807
He brought some of his own
men from New York.

34:49.890 --> 34:52.352
The rest will take their cues
from you,

34:52.435 --> 34:54.020
and if you can't deliver
those cues,

34:54.104 --> 34:55.730
you can deliver me
your resignation

34:55.813 --> 34:56.940
by the end of the day.

34:58.191 --> 34:59.025
Sergeant.

36:02.207 --> 36:03.881
I've been waiting for you.

36:03.965 --> 36:06.717
I come as early as I can.

36:06.801 --> 36:07.635
Oh!

36:08.553 --> 36:09.762
[in Cantonese]
How are you, Lai?

36:12.598 --> 36:14.725
Yes, I'll be staying for a few days.

36:16.221 --> 36:17.437
Mm!

36:22.400 --> 36:23.484
Come inside.

36:29.234 --> 36:32.452
You see black on wall?

36:32.535 --> 36:34.662
This from fire.

36:34.745 --> 36:35.997
You remember riot?

36:37.242 --> 36:39.709
After the mayor die,

36:39.792 --> 36:41.461
many fire.

36:41.544 --> 36:42.712
Yes.

36:42.795 --> 36:45.590
That was a horrible time.

36:45.673 --> 36:47.842
But Chinese people work hard.

36:47.925 --> 36:50.428
Build back their home, hmm?

36:50.511 --> 36:52.597
It should
never have happened.

36:52.680 --> 36:55.725
Well, they did kill
the mayor.

36:55.808 --> 36:57.768
Frannie!

37:04.985 --> 37:07.528
Very sad what happen
to your mayor.

37:08.071 --> 37:10.865
Maybe a Chinese man kill him.

37:10.949 --> 37:12.325
Maybe not.

37:14.910 --> 37:16.537
There bad Chinese people

37:16.621 --> 37:20.583
and maybe bad white people too,
no?

37:21.960 --> 37:25.463
But most of us good,

37:25.546 --> 37:28.216
right?

37:28.293 --> 37:29.842
- Of course.
- Of course.

37:33.221 --> 37:34.555
This way!

37:48.194 --> 37:50.196
Please meet Mai Ling.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.241
Very successful businesswoman
in Chinatown.

37:55.952 --> 37:57.495
Oh, my.

37:57.578 --> 37:59.247
She's really beautiful.

37:59.324 --> 38:00.915
Thank you.

38:00.999 --> 38:02.042
So are you.

38:02.625 --> 38:05.586
Would you like to come inside
and have some tea?

38:05.670 --> 38:07.588
I've just finished renovating,

38:07.672 --> 38:10.383
and it's been ages
since I've had any guests.

38:11.426 --> 38:13.094
You speak like an American.

38:15.388 --> 38:16.597
When in Rome.

38:18.599 --> 38:20.810
Please. Come in.

38:31.696 --> 38:35.741
I was forced into marriage
with a very powerful warlord.

38:35.825 --> 38:38.203
He was cruel to me.

38:38.286 --> 38:39.912
And there was nowhere in China
I could run

38:39.996 --> 38:42.123
where he wouldn't find me.

38:42.207 --> 38:46.627
And so I started secretly
bringing weapons from his home

38:46.711 --> 38:48.254
to the market and selling them.

38:49.047 --> 38:51.674
He had so many.
Never missed them.

38:51.757 --> 38:53.509
And eventually,
I had enough money

38:53.593 --> 38:54.927
for a ticket to America.

38:56.554 --> 38:57.847
My Lord.

39:00.266 --> 39:03.228
What would he have done
if he had caught you?

39:03.311 --> 39:06.106
He would have killed me.

39:06.189 --> 39:08.233
Oh, but if I had stayed,

39:08.316 --> 39:10.568
he would have
eventually killed me anyway.

39:12.237 --> 39:14.030
Or I would have killed myself.

39:15.531 --> 39:18.952
And now you have men
working for you.

39:21.579 --> 39:24.665
I have to imagine there were
almost no opportunities

39:24.749 --> 39:26.411
for a Chinese woman here.

39:26.501 --> 39:28.586
It's really very impressive.

39:28.669 --> 39:30.588
How did you do it?

39:30.671 --> 39:33.008
Well, I just have one rule,
really.

39:33.091 --> 39:35.926
But it's--it's served me well.

39:37.512 --> 39:38.804
Be smarter.

39:39.514 --> 39:40.640
Than whom?

39:42.017 --> 39:43.101
Than the men.

40:04.747 --> 40:06.707
Thank you for having us
in your home.

40:08.168 --> 40:10.545
It was so inspiring
to hear your story.

40:10.628 --> 40:13.458
We're having a small reception
in a few days.

40:13.548 --> 40:14.882
Just some close friends.

40:14.966 --> 40:18.928
But I think they would love
to hear your story.

40:19.012 --> 40:21.056
And it would be
such a unique opportunity

40:21.139 --> 40:22.515
for people to meet

40:22.598 --> 40:25.977
a truly exceptional
Chinese woman

40:26.061 --> 40:27.895
who has overcome so much.

40:30.941 --> 40:33.318
You're inviting me
to your home?

40:33.401 --> 40:34.610
Yes.

40:34.694 --> 40:36.612
And I insist you come.

40:36.696 --> 40:38.739
The details are on the card.

40:38.823 --> 40:40.616
Goodbye.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.118
Goodbye.

40:50.376 --> 40:52.295
Chao did well.

40:52.378 --> 40:55.215
That group was much better
than the last one.

40:55.298 --> 40:57.925
Our new house is
already paying dividends.

41:01.762 --> 41:03.306
You disapprove.

41:04.390 --> 41:06.142
I just don't like the way
they look at you.

41:06.226 --> 41:10.063
They are fascinated with us.

41:10.146 --> 41:12.148
If I can gain their trust,

41:12.232 --> 41:16.569
I can make them see us
as people to do business with.

41:16.652 --> 41:18.321
Chinatown is getting smaller.

41:18.404 --> 41:21.574
We need to expand beyond it.

41:21.657 --> 41:24.202
Out in the pond,
not everyone hates us.

41:26.246 --> 41:28.748
They'll never treat us
as equals.

41:28.831 --> 41:29.958
No.

41:30.041 --> 41:32.710
But the ducks are greedy.

41:32.793 --> 41:36.131
And our money is as good
as anyone else's.

41:47.350 --> 41:49.144
Does it still hurt?

41:49.227 --> 41:51.354
Not so much.

41:51.437 --> 41:53.814
I move fine, no?

41:53.898 --> 41:56.317
Yes, you do.

41:59.904 --> 42:03.699
By the way, I think I may have
found another property.

42:03.783 --> 42:06.744
Just a few miles from here.

42:06.827 --> 42:08.829
Another one?

42:08.913 --> 42:11.666
We could help more girls.

42:11.749 --> 42:14.210
Maybe I buy it with you.

42:14.294 --> 42:16.212
If you want to, yes.

42:18.506 --> 42:20.841
It's very nice here.

42:20.925 --> 42:21.884
With you.

42:21.968 --> 42:23.678
Yeah?

42:23.761 --> 42:26.097
Well, maybe you should consider
staying longer.

42:26.181 --> 42:29.434
Longer? How long?

42:29.517 --> 42:32.853
Always.

42:32.937 --> 42:34.189
Always?

42:34.272 --> 42:36.191
Why not?

42:36.274 --> 42:39.194
You're here so much these days
as it is.

42:39.277 --> 42:43.031
Hmm.
I have business in Chinatown.

42:43.114 --> 42:44.699
This is better business.

42:47.368 --> 42:50.163
Maybe it's time
to think about a change.

42:50.246 --> 42:51.664
Huh?

42:54.500 --> 42:55.918
Maybe.

43:39.795 --> 43:42.007
You're getting slow
in your old age.

43:46.219 --> 43:47.637
You want some company?

43:49.514 --> 43:50.765
You sure you're up for it?

43:52.933 --> 43:55.228
I'm sure I'm not.

43:55.311 --> 43:58.523
My ribs still remember
the last time you hit me.

43:58.606 --> 44:00.483
Mm-hmm.

44:00.566 --> 44:01.734
I have a better idea.

44:08.908 --> 44:11.286
Look, you know
if I had the choice,

44:11.369 --> 44:13.621
I would not have joined
the Long Zii.

44:13.698 --> 44:17.250
But I have to say,
if nothing else,

44:17.333 --> 44:19.335
it's nice to be
your brother in arms again.

44:19.419 --> 44:22.172
It's been too long since
we fought on the same side.

44:22.255 --> 44:24.007
I agree, brother.

44:24.090 --> 44:25.258
Our friendship kept the peace

44:25.341 --> 44:26.634
between our tongs
for many years.

44:26.711 --> 44:28.511
Yes, it did.

44:28.594 --> 44:30.513
If only you had a friend
like me in the Hop Wei.

44:32.890 --> 44:34.559
The thing is, the Hop Wei are
less of a threat today

44:34.642 --> 44:36.186
than they were yesterday.

44:36.269 --> 44:37.645
Maybe.

44:37.722 --> 44:39.814
But Ah Sahm is
no less dangerous.

44:39.897 --> 44:41.857
Don't worry about Ah Sahm.

44:41.942 --> 44:43.728
The beauty of no longer being
the head of a tong

44:43.818 --> 44:45.611
is that I don't worry
about anything.

44:46.988 --> 44:48.614
I leave that to you.

45:00.085 --> 45:03.004
You know,

45:03.088 --> 45:04.714
we all believed
you would take over

45:04.797 --> 45:07.342
when Long Zii died.

45:07.425 --> 45:10.261
Wasn't that your understanding
with the old man?

45:12.055 --> 45:13.556
Mai Ling has done more
for the tong

45:13.639 --> 45:17.393
than I ever could have.

45:17.477 --> 45:18.728
I'm not a leader.

45:24.442 --> 45:26.027
To Long Zii.

45:31.199 --> 45:32.575
To the Long Zii.

45:40.959 --> 45:42.460
Are you kidding me?

46:06.692 --> 46:10.696
Just wanted you to know
that I'm still holding onto it.

46:10.780 --> 46:13.783
In case, you know,
you ever wanna come back.

46:16.452 --> 46:17.954
I could really use you,

46:18.038 --> 46:21.124
what with this new chief
and all.

46:21.207 --> 46:23.668
I thought you were
supposed to be the new chief.

46:23.751 --> 46:25.586
I thought so too.

46:25.670 --> 46:28.673
Mr. Buckley felt otherwise.

46:31.009 --> 46:32.427
I'm sorry, Bill.

46:34.762 --> 46:37.432
But I'm not coming back.

46:37.515 --> 46:39.350
Now you sound like my wife.

46:42.353 --> 46:44.189
She's still at her sister's?

46:46.566 --> 46:49.735
The plan was,
I was gonna be chief

46:49.819 --> 46:53.823
and out of Chinatown,
and she'd come home.

46:53.906 --> 46:56.451
Now, I have no idea
how to get her back.

46:57.535 --> 46:59.204
Bill.

46:59.287 --> 47:01.039
It's bad enough
you drink for free.

47:01.122 --> 47:02.207
If you start recruiting,

47:02.290 --> 47:04.667
I'm gonna have to break
your legs.

47:04.750 --> 47:07.087
Yes, ma'am.

47:07.170 --> 47:09.464
Do I need to worry about you?

47:09.547 --> 47:11.174
No more than usual.

47:11.257 --> 47:12.467
Good.

47:17.882 --> 47:20.016
That's a good woman
you've got there.

47:20.100 --> 47:22.518
Sweet as stolen honey.

47:22.602 --> 47:25.188
But she can ride
the rough string.

47:25.271 --> 47:27.232
Right.

47:27.315 --> 47:29.317
I assume that was you
agreeing with me.

47:32.487 --> 47:34.280
I'll be seeing you.

47:40.161 --> 47:41.537
She'll come back, Bill.

47:42.663 --> 47:44.624
Just give her time.

47:44.707 --> 47:46.709
That's what she said
about you.

47:48.836 --> 47:52.423
Turns out, you're both idiots.

48:02.267 --> 48:03.601
What's this?

48:04.352 --> 48:06.396
Those are your new
lumber prices.

48:08.231 --> 48:10.066
I paid Sanderson a visit
last night.

48:11.817 --> 48:12.693
What'd you do to him?

48:14.988 --> 48:17.573
I negotiated.

48:17.657 --> 48:20.035
And now you have the margins
to hire Irish labor.

48:22.495 --> 48:24.080
He'll honor these numbers?

48:24.164 --> 48:26.082
He will.

48:28.709 --> 48:31.296
They don't completely bridge
the gap,

48:31.379 --> 48:34.924
but they do give me room
to maneuver.

48:35.008 --> 48:39.929
You understand your men will be
working alongside the Chinese.

48:40.013 --> 48:41.639
Will they agree to that?

48:41.722 --> 48:44.225
How many men?

48:44.309 --> 48:47.937
15.

48:48.021 --> 48:49.022
20.

48:51.977 --> 48:53.151
Done.

49:16.716 --> 49:18.134
Good evening.

49:18.218 --> 49:20.803
What the fuck is this?

49:20.886 --> 49:23.098
Watch out.

49:23.181 --> 49:24.975
Watch out for what,
motherfucker?

49:25.058 --> 49:26.142
Huh?

49:26.226 --> 49:27.393
That.

49:36.361 --> 49:37.320
Hey, you!

49:44.369 --> 49:45.578
Oh.

49:45.661 --> 49:46.621
Hey, asshole.

49:46.704 --> 49:48.033
Think you're gonna rob us?

49:48.123 --> 49:49.582
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

49:53.086 --> 49:54.337
Oh, God!

50:02.595 --> 50:03.929
You get what you pay for.

50:06.724 --> 50:07.683
So where's this money?

50:12.730 --> 50:15.060
- It was right here.
- Are you kidding me?

50:47.598 --> 50:49.184
I don't see any money, Chao.

50:51.352 --> 50:53.479
What the hell is this?

50:57.733 --> 50:59.069
Something better.

51:00.736 --> 51:01.947
The fuck
are you talking about?

51:04.240 --> 51:07.994
You know,
my father always said,

51:08.078 --> 51:10.788
the best way to make money...

51:10.871 --> 51:13.118
is to make money.
