WEBVTT

00:05.921 --> 00:07.292
I wonder what he's thinking.

00:08.574 --> 00:10.830
This the police! Stay where
you are, please. Thank you.

00:10.860 --> 00:14.152
By order of Interpol,
all the art is seized.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.126
You are to stay exactly where you are.

00:16.155 --> 00:20.392
The explosion, somebody did it to us.
Someone very close.

00:20.422 --> 00:21.695
The only way to
get me out of this mess

00:21.725 --> 00:23.457
is to make sure that
Brandeis takes the fall.

00:23.487 --> 00:27.139
Police! Quiet, everyone.
I'm looking for John Brandeis.

00:27.298 --> 00:29.031
You don't snap out of heroin.

00:29.509 --> 00:31.285
Whoever that girl is
that they're looking for.

00:31.315 --> 00:32.613
that's not Elena.

00:32.644 --> 00:34.766
Elena's a code name for a file.

00:35.141 --> 00:37.206
Can't believe
he's out of my life.

00:37.236 --> 00:39.444
You do know,
I think the world of you.

00:43.487 --> 00:47.328
We've decided not to pursue charges
against you, for the time being.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.956 --> 01:22.025
Please.

01:23.382 --> 01:24.206
Please!

01:24.494 --> 01:27.036
I told you: the wife,
she must have Elena.

01:29.951 --> 01:31.222
Georgina...

01:36.926 --> 01:37.951
Georgina!

01:39.166 --> 01:42.776
<i>You and I are cut from the same ice</i>

01:42.935 --> 01:46.401
<i>Sincerity made us the perfect heist</i>

01:46.696 --> 01:50.451
<i>Burning all the gold to sapphire skies</i>

01:50.481 --> 01:53.931
<i>But the breeze is cold in paradise</i>

01:53.961 --> 01:57.483
<i>I can feel the whispers in the street</i>

01:57.923 --> 02:01.273
<i>Every night I shiver in my sleep</i>

02:01.303 --> 02:07.714
<i>No reality, cause it's all a dream</i>

02:08.471 --> 02:12.370
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

02:12.400 --> 02:15.793
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

02:15.823 --> 02:23.449
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

02:23.696 --> 02:27.480
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

02:27.510 --> 02:30.786
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

02:30.816 --> 02:38.385
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

03:24.556 --> 03:26.317
Good morning.
Morning.

03:29.263 --> 03:31.516
You've moved the Gauguin.
Yeah.

03:32.122 --> 03:33.841
I think it looks better there.
What do you think?

03:34.770 --> 03:38.294
I suppose it does.
Catches the night.

03:40.113 --> 03:41.081
Exactly.

03:46.840 --> 03:47.995
Where do you want this?

03:49.771 --> 03:50.999
Bottom of the stairs?

03:52.704 --> 03:56.300
Ok, I'll move that later.

03:58.555 --> 04:00.750
Let's put the Lorraine down here
in a corner somewhere.

04:00.780 --> 04:01.616
Ok.

04:05.082 --> 04:06.439
What about this?

04:07.163 --> 04:09.993
Oh, those are your Dad's.

04:10.802 --> 04:12.506
We'll find somewhere
appropriate for them...

04:13.820 --> 04:16.505
later. I should have left,
I'm going out today

04:16.536 --> 04:19.060
Where to?
I just thought I would treat myself.

04:19.437 --> 04:20.216
Quite right.

04:48.257 --> 04:51.549
So sorry for the wait.
No, no, not at all.

05:10.911 --> 05:11.358
There...

05:14.540 --> 05:15.291
please

05:15.868 --> 05:16.778
Fab.

05:19.406 --> 05:23.045
Very good. So much tension!
Yeah.

05:25.113 --> 05:26.860
But you've been through so much.

05:29.806 --> 05:30.845
Tell me...

05:31.900 --> 05:33.806
do you know Plaza Messina

05:35.319 --> 05:36.677
Who are you?

05:37.283 --> 05:39.276
Do not raise your voice, Mischka.

05:39.608 --> 05:41.485
You will regret it.
What do you want?

05:42.166 --> 05:44.332
Please, please.

05:45.415 --> 05:46.743
Shh.

05:48.699 --> 05:52.338
You have something that
does not belong to you.

05:54.215 --> 05:56.886
Elena.
No, that is at the bottom of the sea.

05:58.244 --> 05:59.457
It survived...

06:00.768 --> 06:03.454
and someone removed it
from the Police Station.

06:04.624 --> 06:07.844
We believe that someone was you.
No, it wasn't!

06:07.874 --> 06:11.428
No matter. At 3pm tomorrow,
you will meet me

06:11.458 --> 06:13.739
at the fountain and give it to me.
But I can't!

06:13.769 --> 06:16.944
or I will kill
someone close to you.

06:19.715 --> 06:21.304
Why should I believe you?

06:22.517 --> 06:24.019
Why indeed.

06:28.344 --> 06:31.420
Why should you die for
the sins of your husband?

06:32.763 --> 06:35.868
Why should Adriana, Christos,

06:37.110 --> 06:39.160
your dear friend, Robert?

06:40.477 --> 06:42.614
Please believe me.
I do not exaggerate

06:42.644 --> 06:45.430
when I say I know where
each of them are right now.

06:46.282 --> 06:49.950
There are eyes all over the city and
all I have to do is give the word

06:51.051 --> 06:53.996
It would be a shame if
I have to kill innocent people.

06:55.209 --> 07:02.624
3pm, at the fountain.
Very good. Don't move.

07:30.087 --> 07:31.473
Hello.

07:35.782 --> 07:37.197
Adriana?

08:23.813 --> 08:24.550
Dom!

08:26.236 --> 08:27.204
You're back!

08:28.215 --> 08:29.716
Dom!
Go away>

08:29.746 --> 08:31.810
Come on!
I called you a million times.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.095
Didn't you get my messages?

08:34.542 --> 08:36.318
Ok, I'm sorry.

08:36.347 --> 08:37.871
I don't even really
remember what happened.

08:37.900 --> 08:38.520
No shit.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.845
Dom, what did I do to you?

08:44.432 --> 08:45.847
I think you've done enough.

09:03.263 --> 09:05.574
I just got out of hospital.
I didn't know.

09:06.108 --> 09:06.541
Yeah.

09:11.653 --> 09:13.503
I don't care about you and Sophie...

09:14.225 --> 09:14.846
being...

09:15.597 --> 09:16.319
you know...

09:18.759 --> 09:20.247
together, or whatever.

09:21.057 --> 09:22.689
But those guys
were taking advantage.

09:22.719 --> 09:25.201
I don't think they were.
Don't you know what

09:25.231 --> 09:28.840
guys like those are like?
Jesus Christ, Adriana, wake up!

09:29.362 --> 09:30.748
You're not a kid anymore.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.044
The way they look at you...

09:34.279 --> 09:35.131
and you...

09:35.867 --> 09:37.123
you're just asking for it.

09:37.732 --> 09:40.663
But why would they hurt you?
It was Negrescu.

09:41.082 --> 09:44.909
No, he wouldn't do that.
Are you kidding?

09:46.276 --> 09:47.071
What?

09:49.309 --> 09:49.944
Nothing.

09:51.432 --> 09:53.179
It's mistake.
He wouldn't do that!

09:53.209 --> 09:55.879
My God, how are so naive?
Adriana...

09:57.898 --> 09:59.978
Your mother was fucking him
when he worked here.

10:01.220 --> 10:02.895
Everyone in the house knew it.

10:03.371 --> 10:03.920
Everyone.

10:05.414 --> 10:06.613
What are you talking about?

10:27.353 --> 10:29.302
Are you ok?
I'm fine, I just...

10:30.096 --> 10:32.955
With the way he behaved,
it was like he was playing with me.

10:33.259 --> 10:35.829
He threatened Adriana
and Christos, all of us

10:36.206 --> 10:36.784
Ok.

10:37.535 --> 10:40.351
I need to go to Litvinov.
Do you think that's wise?

10:40.972 --> 10:43.282
Somebody took it
from the Police Station.

10:43.542 --> 10:44.683
Had to have been him.

10:45.850 --> 10:49.749
Trust me. If Litvinov has what we need,
I'll make sure he gives it to me.

10:51.698 --> 10:53.879
Negrescu, salud.

11:28.973 --> 11:29.752
Ok.

12:01.742 --> 12:03.634
Ok, your turn.

12:20.783 --> 12:21.476
Excuse me...

12:22.935 --> 12:23.787
Madame Clios...

12:34.400 --> 12:35.873
Your son?
Yes.

12:36.826 --> 12:39.526
Music lessons,
important for the soul.

12:43.585 --> 12:44.379
Please.

12:47.310 --> 12:49.043
Not that it isn't always
a great pleasure,

12:49.073 --> 12:50.993
but what can I
do for you, Georgina?

12:51.238 --> 12:52.826
It's time for
all of this to be over.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.837
I heard about your security man.
It was that girl.

12:58.949 --> 13:00.321
The Russian girl from the yacht.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.146
I heard.

13:03.026 --> 13:04.369
What else have you heard?

13:11.414 --> 13:13.407
That the investigation was over.

13:13.884 --> 13:14.952
that some...

13:16.858 --> 13:18.172
"Satronika"

13:19.660 --> 13:22.172
tried to do you harm but
you put him in his place.

13:23.515 --> 13:24.555
That's great.

13:25.176 --> 13:26.013
You're learning.

13:28.569 --> 13:29.566
I was...

13:30.273 --> 13:32.281
approached today

13:33.451 --> 13:34.534
Approached by who?

13:35.776 --> 13:38.289
A Russian man. I couldn't
see much more than that.

13:40.383 --> 13:44.139
I came here because
we share an enemy

13:45.540 --> 13:46.926
and I want them to stop.

13:48.132 --> 13:49.013
What did he want?

14:38.055 --> 14:39.513
I don't know if you're aware

14:39.543 --> 14:41.812
but the debris from the yacht
has been returned.

14:42.187 --> 14:43.660
To you?
Yes.

14:44.469 --> 14:45.494
There is something...

14:47.718 --> 14:48.671
a hard drive

14:49.862 --> 14:50.902
It's encrypted.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.573
Well, then, that's it.
That's what they want.

14:54.081 --> 14:55.077
That's Elena.

14:57.518 --> 15:01.142
The question is: what should we do?
No,

15:01.590 --> 15:04.420
No question, Grigory,
we give it back to them

15:06.049 --> 15:07.594
Why?
Why not?

15:08.129 --> 15:10.757
It's not going to do you any good now,
your father is dead

15:11.522 --> 15:12.634
My husband is dead.

15:15.899 --> 15:17.921
End this, once and for all.

15:18.340 --> 15:20.231
Give it to me,
I'll return it to them tomorrow

15:26.082 --> 15:27.064
Perhaps.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.753
No perhaps.

15:29.446 --> 15:32.306
I give it back to them
or I tell them where it is.

15:32.897 --> 15:34.659
Your choice.
My man will do it.

15:34.689 --> 15:37.316
No! He said only me or
people will get hurt.

15:39.973 --> 15:40.839
Ok...

15:43.466 --> 15:46.167
but we will come with you.
These people are ruthless.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.650
We must have no more
blood spilled. Agreed?

15:52.174 --> 15:53.618
And nobody else must know.

15:55.183 --> 15:57.003
Ok. Agreed.

16:19.705 --> 16:21.481
Hey, how are you?

16:24.319 --> 16:26.831
Is everything alright?
Oh, yeah, totally

16:27.987 --> 16:29.936
Antal was murdered, Dad's dead.

16:29.966 --> 16:32.925
Oh, wait! the man who
pretended to be my Dad.

16:33.532 --> 16:34.211
What?

16:34.448 --> 16:35.777
Haven't you heard?

16:35.993 --> 16:37.279
I thought everyone knew.

16:37.986 --> 16:41.466
Mom was shagging that gangster who
owns the casino and used to work here.

16:41.496 --> 16:43.864
Negrescu?
The one and only!

16:44.573 --> 16:45.627
Or should I say...

16:45.916 --> 16:47.244
Daddy Negrescu.

16:48.645 --> 16:49.367
That's...

16:50.551 --> 16:52.298
Who's been saying that?

17:03.530 --> 17:06.548
It's hilarious, right? Right?

17:08.498 --> 17:10.491
When did he even work here?

17:11.891 --> 17:14.412
17, 18 years ago?

17:17.560 --> 17:19.509
It's the funniest thing ever.

17:20.390 --> 17:22.339
Everyone knows
the punch line is me.

17:27.299 --> 17:30.202
Lying bunch of big fucks.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.413
But at least I know
I'm a Clios of some sort, right?

17:37.019 --> 17:38.579
Completely dysfunctional.

18:23.994 --> 18:25.135
You look better.

18:27.287 --> 18:29.019
Are They good to you here/
Mm-hmm.

18:30.232 --> 18:31.099
Good.

18:32.673 --> 18:33.655
And how are you?

18:38.050 --> 18:39.032
I am

18:39.840 --> 18:40.476
ok.

18:41.833 --> 18:44.028
We've been summoned to
make the statement tomorrow.

18:44.758 --> 18:46.534
Tomorrow?
Yes.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.902
You are ready?
Yes.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.837
If we do this, we're safe. Right?

18:58.840 --> 18:59.909
The only way.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.681
Are you ok?

19:22.917 --> 19:23.971
Is Dom here?

19:24.910 --> 19:25.632
Gone home.

19:27.031 --> 19:27.696
Is he ok?

19:30.179 --> 19:31.710
Looks like a punch bag.

19:35.277 --> 19:36.316
What if it's true?

19:39.589 --> 19:40.629
He's a monster.

19:52.807 --> 19:55.782
Maybe you should just ask her.

20:02.513 --> 20:03.322
Yeah.

20:20.332 --> 20:23.119
You know, I never thought
I would say this but

20:23.639 --> 20:25.718
I'm quite starting to
like the coffee here.

20:27.942 --> 20:29.444
I still miss espresso.

20:30.085 --> 20:31.991
You're an espresso girl!
Mm-hm!

20:32.178 --> 20:35.052
Small and strong.
Uh-huh, just like you.

20:37.247 --> 20:40.121
Wow, that was so cheese.
Cheesy.

20:40.879 --> 20:43.680
Yes, cheesy.
Yeah, thanks.

20:46.164 --> 20:49.500
Ok, so, plan for tomorrow...

20:50.383 --> 20:53.271
Shall we go on the
hunt for real espresso?

20:53.487 --> 20:57.256
I'm on a Day Release tomorrow.
Really? How come?

20:58.586 --> 21:02.355
I'm making a statement
about my sister for the Police.

21:02.817 --> 21:04.536
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

21:05.604 --> 21:06.182
Ok.

21:07.164 --> 21:07.698
And...

21:08.443 --> 21:10.075
you ok with everything?

21:11.909 --> 21:12.443
Yeah.

21:13.988 --> 21:15.634
I'm good, actually.

21:17.889 --> 21:19.622
For the first time in a long time.

21:22.423 --> 21:22.943
Good.

22:38.099 --> 22:40.077
Lost your key?
I threw it away.

22:41.297 --> 22:42.048
Sorry?

22:42.078 --> 22:44.835
I threw it away!
I'm not coming back here!

22:44.865 --> 22:47.882
Do you want to come in?
Did you shag that man, Negrescu?

22:50.039 --> 22:52.378
Or do I come out and talk to you like this?

22:56.900 --> 22:57.868
Did you?

22:58.171 --> 23:00.698
That's preposterous!
Why would I have anything to do...

23:00.728 --> 23:03.110
Years and years and years ago.

23:03.370 --> 23:05.969
What is this?
He beat up Dominic.

23:07.676 --> 23:09.207
Why?
You tell me.

23:10.868 --> 23:13.467
Sophie, what's...
what's going on?

23:13.857 --> 23:16.817
I don't know. Dominic had
to go to the hospital and...

23:18.179 --> 23:20.894
we were at his club,
Negrescu's club, and...

23:21.371 --> 23:24.706
You went to his club?
I told you to stay away from him.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.551
And you go to his club. Adriana...

23:29.563 --> 23:31.094
Adriana!

23:34.415 --> 23:35.932
Did you sleep with him?

23:37.202 --> 23:38.329
This is nonsense.

23:40.427 --> 23:41.423
You're lying.

23:42.969 --> 23:45.741
You're fucking lying!

23:48.283 --> 23:49.438
I'm sorry.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.508
When I was 15 years old,

24:02.013 --> 24:03.457
I wasn't exactly...

24:05.508 --> 24:08.136
I mean, I had girlfriends but
I wasn't confident.

24:08.974 --> 24:10.071
I wasn't sporty.

24:11.012 --> 24:14.839
My mother kept pointing it out.
Little remarks...

24:15.879 --> 24:18.925
I built up a bit of an attitude.
That helped but...

24:20.959 --> 24:22.880
I still wasn't exactly,
you know, shaping up

24:22.910 --> 24:24.569
to be the son that she wanted.

24:25.926 --> 24:29.147
One day, this girl starts
talking to me and she's...

24:30.244 --> 24:30.981
beautiful.

24:32.873 --> 24:34.837
I can't believe
she's interested but

24:35.834 --> 24:37.595
she's laughing
at all of my jokes.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.844
We go back to mine. We have sex.

24:43.059 --> 24:43.882
Far amazing...

24:45.427 --> 24:46.120
and

24:46.611 --> 24:47.175
real.

24:48.445 --> 24:51.694
A few months later,
I see her in a club...

24:52.638 --> 24:53.605
and

24:56.017 --> 24:57.851
I hadn't heard from her, so

24:58.948 --> 25:00.927
I go over and say

25:01.275 --> 25:03.744
"Hey, I missed you" or something

25:04.062 --> 25:05.708
but she's acting really weird.

25:09.116 --> 25:11.065
Her friends are laughing.

25:13.710 --> 25:14.923
I realized

25:15.977 --> 25:17.219
they're laughing at me.

25:18.793 --> 25:20.425
It turns out she's a prostitute.

25:21.412 --> 25:26.033
Yeah, it turns out someone paid
for her to sleep with me.

25:27.491 --> 25:28.791
to make me more of a man.

25:31.994 --> 25:34.203
What a thoughtful mom, right?

25:36.513 --> 25:40.427
I mean, I can't work it out.
Does that mean she loves me...

25:44.202 --> 25:47.046
I hated the prostitute.
It never occurred to me...

25:48.231 --> 25:49.241
to hate my Mom.

25:57.666 --> 26:00.453
Look, these are the same people
that killed your father.

26:00.483 --> 26:02.287
I'm putting an end to it.

26:02.981 --> 26:04.901
I just... Well, you should
let me come with you.

26:05.320 --> 26:08.338
I can stay out of sight.
I have protection.

26:11.471 --> 26:13.349
Besides, if they see you,
they'll kill you.

26:14.505 --> 26:17.061
If they see that,
they'll kill you.

26:19.444 --> 26:20.339
You're right.

26:29.491 --> 26:30.256
Wait for me.

26:40.922 --> 26:43.175
Don't lecture me about
single parenthood drama.

26:43.205 --> 26:44.677
I just saw the girls.
I know they're here.

26:45.572 --> 26:46.525
Adriana?

26:48.980 --> 26:49.919
Adriana!

26:53.482 --> 26:54.666
Adriana!

27:00.183 --> 27:01.656
Could you come with me, please?
No.

27:03.641 --> 27:05.547
Adriana, I...
I don't want to.

27:08.262 --> 27:09.316
I won't ask you again.

27:09.475 --> 27:11.713
What are you going to do,
call the cops?

27:13.314 --> 27:15.263
Sophie, go inside.

27:23.432 --> 27:24.024
Sorry.

27:32.269 --> 27:33.237
Tell me the truth.

27:39.772 --> 27:41.620
I was unfaithful to your father.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.223
we both were, in the end.

27:45.806 --> 27:47.806
Our marriage was broken, darling.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.719
I'm so sorry for that.

27:54.768 --> 27:55.389
But...

27:57.059 --> 27:58.302
you must believe me.

28:00.436 --> 28:01.660
when I tell you...

28:03.213 --> 28:05.660
not Jakob Negrescu.

28:07.077 --> 28:11.096
That old rumor has been around
the Villa Dissot for eons

28:11.824 --> 28:13.533
and it's not true.

28:15.377 --> 28:17.979
I thought you'd credit me
with a little more class.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.709
How'd you know I was here?
Sophie.

28:28.136 --> 28:30.660
Don't be upset.
She was right about you...

28:31.611 --> 28:33.708
hurting yourself.
I haven't.

28:34.485 --> 28:35.980
I'm fine. Really, Mum.

28:36.640 --> 28:40.795
Well, good! I'm grateful to her.
She's a good girl.

28:42.422 --> 28:43.646
Yeah, she's the best.

28:45.898 --> 28:46.578
You like her?

28:49.568 --> 28:51.898
I'm happy someone
makes you happy.

29:09.067 --> 29:12.212
I'll call you. Leave the car
running and I'll have it in my bag.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.771
That way, you can hear
everything's that going on.

29:15.043 --> 29:15.547
Ok.

29:24.311 --> 29:25.495
So, this is it?

29:26.544 --> 29:27.554
Elena?

29:28.175 --> 29:29.282
Yes, it is.

29:31.413 --> 29:33.529
All this trouble
for something so small.

30:06.317 --> 30:09.133
Perhaps we should have
given her the real hard drive.

30:09.366 --> 30:12.706
They will kill her.
By the time they see it is a fake,

30:12.736 --> 30:16.296
we will have followed them.
She will be safe.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.134
Fuck.

31:17.759 --> 31:18.381
Shit!

31:22.453 --> 31:23.385
Nadia?

31:24.007 --> 31:24.473
Yes.

31:24.842 --> 31:27.579
It's her, isn't it?
The girl from the boat?

31:28.461 --> 31:28.986
Yes.

31:29.219 --> 31:31.937
What of you?
Did you blow up the boat?

31:33.995 --> 31:35.471
Yes, I did it.

31:38.509 --> 31:40.335
Can you make a shot from here?

31:42.936 --> 31:43.597
No.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.432
I like to be closer.

31:46.762 --> 31:48.703
What happened to Constantine?

31:49.653 --> 31:51.303
Did he die?
Yes.

31:52.196 --> 31:54.682
He was on the boat.
Were you sleeping with him?

31:55.031 --> 31:56.526
Is this important to you?

31:56.837 --> 31:58.992
I have what you want.
I just need to know.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.255
No, I didn't know
your husband that way.

32:30.948 --> 32:31.977
Where's the key?

32:33.162 --> 32:35.259
Where's the key? -What key?
It doesn't work without a key.

32:35.744 --> 32:36.909
I don't have a key.

32:36.939 --> 32:38.365
This is impossible!

32:38.987 --> 32:40.754
Ah, should I believe this?

32:41.127 --> 32:42.350
Nadia...

32:44.408 --> 32:48.583
He's going to kill us.
What? Who?

32:50.889 --> 32:52.268
Ok, ok, look...

32:53.588 --> 32:56.074
Tell me what it looks like.
I can help you find it.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.889
You were searching for it
at the house, right? I...

32:58.919 --> 33:01.278
I could help you.
I'll search the house,

33:01.308 --> 33:04.087
the bank. For fuck sake!

33:04.281 --> 33:06.844
Nikolai, I believe her.
She can help us.

33:08.028 --> 33:11.601
Tell, tell him it's ok.
Tell him I will help you.

33:11.828 --> 33:12.683
Please!

33:14.256 --> 33:14.935
Please!

33:16.256 --> 33:17.984
I want to see my son again.

33:23.661 --> 33:25.875
Bring Mrs. Clios to me, now.

33:30.011 --> 33:31.021
Thank you.

33:31.249 --> 33:32.026
We're ok?

33:32.056 --> 33:33.482
We're ok now?
Yes, yes.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.346
We must go.

33:36.570 --> 33:37.152
Come.

34:04.586 --> 34:05.479
Georgina!

34:09.130 --> 34:09.829
Come on!

34:34.030 --> 34:34.943
Let's go.

34:45.324 --> 34:47.344
It's ok. It's over.

34:48.101 --> 34:49.616
They killed her.
I know.

34:50.081 --> 34:53.636
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
They executed her.

34:54.164 --> 34:55.813
Georgina...
What happened to the case?

34:55.844 --> 34:56.630
Stay calm.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.426
They said that they would kill us all
if we didn't give it to them.

34:59.456 --> 35:02.183
We have to go back, we have to go back!
No, we don't.

35:02.785 --> 35:03.950
Right now, we do nothing.

35:06.256 --> 35:08.664
Ok. It's ok.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.239
Bullshit!

35:34.816 --> 35:35.399
Let go!

35:37.574 --> 35:38.428
Put her down!

35:39.030 --> 35:39.865
Christophe!

35:53.260 --> 35:55.609
Who knew you were here?
She's just so crazy.

35:55.639 --> 35:58.056
No! No, no, no.
Fatima, who knew?

35:58.425 --> 36:01.998
No one, just the policeman, Delormes.

36:05.662 --> 36:07.895
Then you can't trust him.
I do trust him.He's a good man.

36:07.925 --> 36:09.255
No, he's not.

36:09.285 --> 36:11.196
Let me out!

36:11.226 --> 36:13.682
Ok, we need to go.
Let me out!

36:14.099 --> 36:16.002
Let me out!

36:28.563 --> 36:31.786
Can you buzz us out, please?
No!

37:10.157 --> 37:12.526
I understand
Adriana visited your club.

37:14.273 --> 37:16.797
Yes.
You should have told me.

37:18.382 --> 37:20.266
You're right. I apologize.

37:21.043 --> 37:24.421
Some piece of shit was
trying it on with her.

37:24.713 --> 37:27.004
As I understand it,
he was a friend of hers

37:27.034 --> 37:29.297
and he was badly beaten.

37:30.967 --> 37:33.607
Well, you can't blame me
or being protective.

37:34.326 --> 37:35.938
She doesn't need your protection.

37:40.660 --> 37:42.097
What is it, Irina?

37:43.922 --> 37:44.660
Hm?

37:57.550 --> 38:00.851
Have you said something to her?
You must tell me if you have.

38:03.434 --> 38:05.686
No, I haven't said a word.

38:09.084 --> 38:10.851
And I'm not going to.

38:14.089 --> 38:18.672
Look, Irina, I've been
doing some thinking.

38:21.249 --> 38:23.210
If we are going to do this,

38:23.694 --> 38:25.694
We are going to do this properly.

38:27.772 --> 38:32.218
I mean, if I am helping you
get everything back that's yours,

38:34.731 --> 38:37.896
I want to get back what's mine.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.119
You.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.068
How are you feeling?

39:03.126 --> 39:04.524
I can't stop seeing it.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.074
Every time I close my eyes.

39:09.812 --> 39:10.919
It's ok.

39:13.346 --> 39:14.725
It's ok to be afraid.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.113
I'm not.

39:19.110 --> 39:20.567
At least, she's gone now.

39:22.353 --> 39:23.673
She killed my husband.

39:24.935 --> 39:26.314
She got what she deserved.

39:28.271 --> 39:29.048
You're right.

39:30.990 --> 39:32.524
She's gone

39:33.320 --> 39:34.310
and we're here.

39:35.179 --> 39:36.868
Nadia's dead and

39:37.363 --> 39:41.110
there's nothing to be afraid of now.
We're free. It's just

39:41.605 --> 39:42.634
you and me.

39:44.984 --> 39:47.722
What?
It's ok, I'm here now.

39:49.314 --> 39:49.955
No.

39:50.222 --> 39:53.406
Adam, we talked about this.
Stop!

39:54.260 --> 39:56.629
Whatever it is that you're feeling,

39:57.848 --> 39:58.877
it's a mistake.

39:59.110 --> 40:01.790
It's not a mistake.
It is a mistake...

40:01.820 --> 40:05.964
and I don't feel the same way.
You're lying to yourself...

40:06.270 --> 40:08.503
or your lying to me.
I am not.

40:09.260 --> 40:11.513
I haven't.
I saved your life.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.425
Hey!

40:13.474 --> 40:15.532
Why do you do this?
Look,

40:16.055 --> 40:20.036
Adam, you are my stepson.
Stop saying that!

40:24.051 --> 40:26.226
Ok, give me 2 seconds.
Ok.

40:26.256 --> 40:28.090
Oh, get the pink ones I like.
Ok.

40:29.721 --> 40:31.565
If you just give me a chance,

40:32.206 --> 40:33.386
What are you... Get off!

40:33.416 --> 40:35.638
I love you.
You stop it!

40:35.668 --> 40:37.289
with my head.
Get off of me!

40:55.474 --> 40:56.950
I just tried to tell you both.

41:01.722 --> 41:04.130
Well, that was quick.
Just drive.

41:06.946 --> 41:10.654
Drive! Let's go.

41:13.066 --> 41:15.222
What the fuck
did you do that for?

41:15.455 --> 41:17.105
You're just like the rest of them.

41:17.135 --> 41:19.862
You think that you can
just take whatever you want.

41:19.892 --> 41:23.693
Well you can't!
This family is a cancer.

41:23.945 --> 41:26.217
It is poisoned at the root.

41:26.247 --> 41:29.596
You sick, entitled fuck!

41:32.456 --> 41:35.854
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

41:35.884 --> 41:39.548

sparring wars with expensive things</i>

41:39.578 --> 41:47.100

All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>
