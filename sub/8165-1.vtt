You okay?

18:05.226 --> 18:06.386
- No, I am not okay.
- Whoa...

18:06.695 --> 18:08.375

a tattoo last night.

18:09.631 --> 18:10.751
- What're you talking about?

18:11.066 --> 18:12.349

Oh, my God.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.420
I... I did not know that
that was your daughter.

18:22.177 --> 18:23.257
I... there were four girls.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.499
They all came in here
at the same time.

18:25.981 --> 18:26.981
I... I had no idea.

18:27.215 --> 18:28.855

18:32.020 --> 18:32.552
And then you stood me up
at a bar

18:33.088 --> 18:35.248
And broke with me with a text,
which I guess I deserve,

18:35.690 --> 18:37.090
But it still made me
feel like crap.

18:39.027 --> 18:39.492
I didn't stand you up,

18:39.961 --> 18:41.601
And I definitely didn't
break up with you.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.513
- Oh, no?

18:44.532 --> 18:46.215
Sorry, can't make it work.

18:47.902 --> 18:48.902

18:48.937 --> 18:49.970
Uh, it's, "Sorry."

18:51.006 --> 18:52.122
"Can't make it."

18:53.241 --> 18:54.241

of the four girls

18:57.679 --> 18:59.379

- Have you ever
heard of punctuation?

19:03.518 --> 19:05.635
- I mean, I thought
the meaning was pretty obvious.

19:07.756 --> 19:08.756
- Well, not at the time.

19:09.057 --> 19:10.057
- Yeah, I see that.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.225
- So you didn't mean
to break up with me?

19:13.094 --> 19:14.094
- No.

19:16.031 --> 19:16.763
- Good,

19:16.765 --> 19:18.715
'cause I was really sad
thinking that's what happened.
