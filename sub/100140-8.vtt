the trail of tears

was the relocations

And, you know, they came
straight through mcminnville,

20:06.800 --> 20:09.500

500 graves

that trail of tears there.

39:56.690 --> 39:59.590
Yep, it was like a male voice
saying something.

39:59.590 --> 40:01.590
[<i> faint warbling</i> ]

40:01.600 --> 40:02.890
-wow.
-Yeah.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.900
Jason: Numerous male voices,
dissipating mist,

40:05.900 --> 40:08.870
and two anomalies captured
on the thermal camera

40:08.870 --> 40:11.700
all point to the original owners
of this property.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.670
And even though we didn't get
any evidence

40:13.670 --> 40:16.440
of a female presence
being in this house...

40:16.440 --> 40:20.310
Nancy? Did somebody
see you in this room?

40:20.310 --> 40:23.880
...The apparition that ginger
witnessed could very well be

40:23.880 --> 40:26.050
thomas's wife, nancy burroughs,

40:26.050 --> 40:29.750
whose energy may have remained
with the rest of her family.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.390
Imagine being thomas burroughs,
who built the house...
Mm-hmm.

40:33.390 --> 40:36.760
...And then his son lives in it
after him, this whole lineage.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.630
Yes, his family, his children
grew up in the home.

40:39.630 --> 40:43.900
Exactly. So he could feel
protective over the home

40:43.900 --> 40:46.670
and over the people
who currently live in it.

40:46.670 --> 40:48.010
We've caught
a lot of evidence

40:48.010 --> 40:50.210
that supports everything
that you guys have experienced,

40:50.210 --> 40:52.510
and I think you have
paranormal activity,

40:52.510 --> 40:53.750
but I just want you
to understand

40:53.750 --> 40:56.010
that sometimes when you have
those experiences,

40:56.020 --> 40:59.450
don't automatically assume that
they're malicious or negative.
Okay.

40:59.450 --> 41:01.720
You being held down --
this could be their way

41:01.720 --> 41:03.220
of trying to
get your attention,

41:03.220 --> 41:04.990
not harm you.
Right.

41:04.990 --> 41:07.430
The dresser being pushed
in front of the door

41:07.430 --> 41:09.230
very possibly wasn't
a malicious intent.

41:09.230 --> 41:11.330
Being pushed up the stairs
not being pushed down.

41:11.330 --> 41:12.700
Exactly.

41:12.700 --> 41:13.730
We didn't see any signs

41:13.730 --> 41:15.700
that there was anything here
to fear.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.940
But we do know
you've experienced things

41:17.940 --> 41:19.540
that say otherwise.

41:19.540 --> 41:21.240
You're concerned about
your health,

41:21.240 --> 41:24.140
so we want to stay
on top of this case.

41:24.140 --> 41:25.340
And mark's still here,

41:25.350 --> 41:26.440
and he knows how to get
in touch with us.

41:26.450 --> 41:28.250
I definitely feel
a lot better now.

41:28.250 --> 41:32.080
Of course, if anything
seems like it's picking up

41:32.090 --> 41:33.690
or it's becoming
the least bit aggressive,

41:33.690 --> 41:36.620
let us know 'cause we'll come
back in a heartbeat for you.
Yeah.

41:36.620 --> 41:39.290
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.760
Jason: We hope we've helped
the di vincenzos understand

41:41.760 --> 41:44.800
that the spirits haunting
their home are non-threatening.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.530
The fact is,
a house this old

41:46.530 --> 41:49.670
can sometimes carry
the remnants of its past.

41:49.670 --> 41:52.240
And in this case,
the burroughs family

41:52.240 --> 41:54.010
is just not ready to leave.

41:54.010 --> 42:02.080
