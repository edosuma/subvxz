00:53.587 --> 00:54.653
<i> I love christmas.</i>

00:54.672 --> 00:55.487
<i> Me too.</i>

00:55.506 --> 00:57.289
<i> Me three.</i>

00:57.324 --> 00:59.041
Warm cookies!
I love you, cat.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.793
I hope they taste okay.

01:02.046 --> 01:03.378
Greatness!

01:03.431 --> 01:04.379
What's in these?

01:04.432 --> 01:07.766
I experimented...
I put citrus in the glaze.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.218
You're lucky, sarah.

01:09.270 --> 01:13.222
I'm barely allowed in
the kitchen at my house.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.140
We barely have a
kitchen at mine.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.312
There's an empty spot.

01:20.347 --> 01:21.146
Where?

01:21.181 --> 01:23.148
Right there,
it's totally naked.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.651
It's fine, not everything
has to be perfect.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.286
You mean like ethan?

01:27.321 --> 01:29.354
With the perfect eyes
and the perfect smile.

01:29.373 --> 01:30.856
The perfect everything.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.691
You guys are so lame!

01:32.710 --> 01:35.494
Who are you going to
the christmas dance with?

01:35.529 --> 01:38.163
Ethan, so it'll be
a perfect christmas.

01:44.421 --> 01:45.671
From my mom.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.872
It's not christmas yet.

01:46.891 --> 01:48.841
They're for now,
open them.

01:55.232 --> 01:56.482
She made these?

01:56.517 --> 01:58.734
Yeah, I told her you neither
one had stockings

01:58.769 --> 02:00.352
and she went all,
"what? That sucks!"

02:00.387 --> 02:01.854
your mom said "sucks?"

02:01.889 --> 02:04.022
more or less: I translated.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.195
Are you all right?

02:10.230 --> 02:11.396
It's just...

02:11.415 --> 02:14.783
This is the sweetest thing
anybody has ever done for me.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.451
Same here.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.120
But we don't
have a fireplace.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.571
And we don't put
up decorations.

02:19.590 --> 02:23.709
Guys, hello? They go
up here next to mine.

02:25.763 --> 02:29.548
Mom says you're here so
often you're like family.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.250
See? Like magic.

02:32.269 --> 02:33.519
We're family.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.723
Now I'm gonna cry.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.807
Me too.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.058
Me three.

02:42.780 --> 02:44.396
Promise we'll decorate
the house every christmas

02:44.431 --> 02:45.531
for the rest
of our lives?

02:45.566 --> 02:46.732
Swear.

02:48.619 --> 02:51.203
Come on guys,
let's finish the tree.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.574
This is the most christmasy
house on holly lane.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.543
In all of kirkwood falls.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.328
I'm thinking you and ethan

02:59.363 --> 03:01.830
should have a christmas
wedding right here.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.449
<i> Sarah, where do we</i>
<i> keep the paintbrushes?</i>

03:37.484 --> 03:40.202
They're in the same place
they've been since we moved in:

03:40.254 --> 03:41.620
The basement cabinet.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.956
You're making dad
fix another crack?

03:43.991 --> 03:47.376
I just want it to look nice for
when cat and riley get here.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.627
You're kinda overdoing it.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.878
Thank you, hannah.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.797
I mean who else other than
your mother would notice

03:51.832 --> 03:55.834
this little, tiny, practically
invisible hairline crack?

03:55.853 --> 03:58.437
Can you drive me
to school, dad?

03:59.390 --> 04:01.189
I'm sorry, I
gotta get to work

04:01.225 --> 04:03.892
and put up the
christmas decorations.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.979
Hey, you better hurry
or you'll miss the bus.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.567
I don't know why we ever
bought this creaky old shack.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.453
Because my parents
gave us a deal.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.821
On a money pit!

04:18.742 --> 04:20.659
I'm worried about hannah.

04:21.996 --> 04:23.462
She's doing all right.

04:23.497 --> 04:27.132
She's not...
She misses her dad.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.801
I can't get into
this right now.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.087
It's never a good
time for you, ethan.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.422
What do you want?

04:33.474 --> 04:36.341
I want us to go see
a marriage counselor.

04:36.376 --> 04:39.227
How much is that going to cost?
Money's tight as it is.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.097
If you're so worried
about money,

04:42.149 --> 04:44.099
maybe you should
move back home.

04:44.151 --> 04:47.886
Okay I... Okay fine.

04:47.905 --> 04:50.689
Find a counselor.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.857
This needs to dry.

04:51.892 --> 04:55.160
So I'll come back later
and finish painting.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.695
Today please?

04:56.730 --> 04:57.829
The girls get
here tomorrow.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.448
Fine, today.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.399
Why are they coming, anyway?

05:01.418 --> 05:02.918
I don't know, ethan.

05:02.953 --> 05:05.253
Because you flipped
my life upside down

05:05.289 --> 05:07.956
and I'm upset and
I miss my friends.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.037
Time to go.

05:39.073 --> 05:40.205
<i> [text message alert]</i>

05:40.240 --> 05:42.541
ashley says it's no problem
me spending the weekend

05:42.576 --> 05:45.160
while you're gone, cat.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.996
I am not cat, I'm mom.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.748
Ashley calls her mother
by her first name.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.167
Yeah, we're not doing that.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.885
So what about this weekend?

05:53.921 --> 05:57.005
You wouldn't have to pay mrs.
Todd and it would be super cool.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.758
Ashley's parents
own a home theatre.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.145
You get to have fun
with your friends,

06:03.180 --> 06:04.963
why can't I have
some fun with mine?

06:04.982 --> 06:07.632
This trip isn't
all about fun.

06:07.651 --> 06:09.634
Besides, I barely
know ashley's parents.

06:09.653 --> 06:12.571
Oh my god, I promise
they're not drug dealers.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.772
Please?

06:14.892 --> 06:16.358
Okay, I'll talk to her mother.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.410
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.779
Did I tell you her
dad drives a maserati?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.497
You've mentioned it.

06:22.533 --> 06:24.583
Hey, could we go shopping
after school for shoes?

06:24.618 --> 06:27.035
Yes! That's why I
am leaving work early.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.839
Oh! Did I tell you that
ashley invited me to maui

06:30.874 --> 06:32.257
for christmas with
her whole family?

06:32.292 --> 06:33.091
What?

06:33.127 --> 06:34.176
I know, right?

06:34.211 --> 06:35.877
Honey, I want to spend
christmas with you.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.796
Mom, I'm talking hawaii.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.798
You'll be working,
I'll be bored.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.016
I don't see the problem.

06:41.051 --> 06:44.102
You not seeing the
problem is the problem!

06:45.355 --> 06:46.188
Maui!

07:00.237 --> 07:01.536
<i> I need the numbers.</i>

07:01.572 --> 07:03.688
You said they'd
be ready today.

07:03.707 --> 07:05.574
Define soon.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.025
No, that doesn't work.

07:07.044 --> 07:10.579
Let me be clear: I'm on a plane
10 a.M. Tomorrow morning.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.080
If I don't have
the data tonight,

07:12.132 --> 07:13.582
you don't have
a job on Monday.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.916
Thank you.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.170
What's this?

07:18.205 --> 07:23.225
Special delivery for
riley nelson from ryan shaw.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.894
Do you want them?

07:25.929 --> 07:27.262
You don't?

07:27.314 --> 07:28.563
Why encourage him?

07:28.599 --> 07:29.731
I thought you liked him!

07:29.766 --> 07:32.567
Nice enough guy,
no growth potential.

07:32.603 --> 07:33.602
Enjoy!

07:37.224 --> 07:39.324
Yo riley, where are
we on mayfield snow?

07:39.359 --> 07:42.160
You will have the report on
your desk first thing Monday.

07:42.196 --> 07:44.946
Any chance I can
sneak an early peak?

07:44.998 --> 07:47.833
I'm still getting
it in shape.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.167
How about this?

07:49.203 --> 07:51.620
I come over to your
place this weekend,

07:51.672 --> 07:53.404
maybe read it
over your shoulder?

07:53.423 --> 07:55.507
Bring a nice merlot.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.342
I'm out of town.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.095
Are you working
half-time these days?

08:00.130 --> 08:02.464
65 hours this week
and counting.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.082
I need to visit a friend.

08:04.101 --> 08:05.684
She as hot as you?

08:05.719 --> 08:09.137
Don't make me call hr.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.257
The report: Any red flags?

08:12.276 --> 08:13.808
No.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.927
Sounds like a yes.

08:15.946 --> 08:18.263
It's just that this
company has the potential

08:18.282 --> 08:19.781
of winding up like
cody international.

08:19.816 --> 08:22.701
Which if memory serves,
made us quite a bundle.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.653
But there was a lot of--

08:24.705 --> 08:28.790
jeez nelson,
don't be such a girl.

08:28.825 --> 08:31.293
If you wanna step up
to the majors,

08:31.328 --> 08:33.211
you're gonna have
to grow a pair.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.342
Hi.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.843
Hey chef, you're early.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.428
I want to get all
of my prep done

08:50.463 --> 08:52.731
so I can take
taylor to the mall.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.900
Uh, we have a problem.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.234
What?

08:56.270 --> 08:58.853
Chin's seafood didn't deliver.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.322
What's going on
with my seafood?

09:00.357 --> 09:02.190
They're being very
small-minded.

09:03.493 --> 09:05.827
You sent them a check, right?

09:05.862 --> 09:07.862
Mason?

09:07.915 --> 09:10.532
I was sitting there
with three jacks. Three!

09:10.584 --> 09:13.151
The guy across from
me was showing nada.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.920
Your check bounced!

09:14.955 --> 09:16.705
What am I supposed to
do about the delivery?

09:16.757 --> 09:19.490
I convinced newman's to
let me open an account.

09:19.509 --> 09:20.992
Newman's will
deliver garbage

09:21.011 --> 09:22.660
if I don't go
pick it out myself.

09:22.679 --> 09:23.762
Then go down.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.264
It's in newport beach,
it'll take me half the day.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.000
I promised taylor
we'd go shopping later.

09:29.019 --> 09:31.436
She'll live.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.438
Mason, I'm her only parent.

09:33.473 --> 09:36.274
It's not like
she can ask her dad.

09:37.728 --> 09:39.811
Quit using that excuse.

09:53.577 --> 09:55.910
My friends are coming
in this weekend.

09:55.963 --> 09:59.748
They were like my
besties growing up.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.000
It'll be nice to have
everybody under one roof.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.385
It's been so long.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.137
Do they have to stay here?

10:06.173 --> 10:07.555
It's just one weekend.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.211
What?

10:13.230 --> 10:16.481
What if dad wants to move
back in and they're here?

10:19.319 --> 10:21.987
Honey, your father and I
have a lot to figure out.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.040
But he is coming back,
isn't he?

10:25.075 --> 10:27.976
I certainly hope so.

10:28.011 --> 10:30.862
But it's not gonna
be this weekend.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.999
Goodnight... Love you.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.250
Love you too.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.246
It's just as I remember.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.714
Look at the trees.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.115
I miss the seasons.

11:24.134 --> 11:25.133
Hey!

11:26.136 --> 11:27.502
Could you bring the
bags inside please?

11:27.554 --> 11:28.336
Thank you.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.620
I feel so much better now.

11:29.639 --> 11:30.555
Me too.

11:30.590 --> 11:31.589
Me three.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.758
Get inside, it's cold!

11:33.793 --> 11:34.592
So?

11:34.627 --> 11:35.560
You look great.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.095
You look great!

11:41.902 --> 11:43.468
Wow, memories.

11:43.487 --> 11:45.270
You've made some changes...

11:46.473 --> 11:48.106
But it still feels the same.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.991
Like coming home.

11:50.026 --> 11:52.026
I love that you
still live here.

11:53.029 --> 11:54.946
Anchor in stormy seas.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.082
As in I stayed
put while you two

11:57.117 --> 11:58.649
were off sailing
on adventures?

11:58.668 --> 12:00.752
You heard me say
stormy, right?

12:00.787 --> 12:04.422
50 foot waves,
itty bitty boat.

12:04.458 --> 12:08.009
Well, do you guys wanna go
downtown to kirkwood falls,

12:08.044 --> 12:09.010
see how much has changed?

12:09.045 --> 12:09.928
It has?

12:09.963 --> 12:10.929
No.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.515
Let's go!

12:13.550 --> 12:14.632
C'mon.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.012
<i> Christmas is in the air.</i>

12:28.031 --> 12:29.564
It's my favorite
time of year.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.117
Gotta say, there's a
distinctly different vibe

12:32.152 --> 12:34.402
here than la.
Must be the disconnect

12:34.454 --> 12:37.822
between surf boards
and sleigh bells.

12:37.857 --> 12:38.740
Let me guess:

12:38.792 --> 12:41.359
Santa comes in
on a surf board?

12:41.378 --> 12:42.961
I miss the snow.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.329
It makes everything
clean again.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.964
Sure does!

12:45.999 --> 12:48.416
-So pretty.
-Isn't it?

12:48.468 --> 12:51.669
Our snow in new york:
Not so clean.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.222
[giggling]

12:54.257 --> 12:55.706
dot's cafe.

12:55.725 --> 12:57.225
Still standing.

12:57.260 --> 13:00.061
How many burgers and fries
did we down at this place?

13:00.096 --> 13:02.847
I'm pretty sure big pharma
of us and invented statins.

13:05.051 --> 13:08.570
Get out! Is that
peyton curzon?

13:08.605 --> 13:10.688
Peyton clark now.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.674
As in tommie clark?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.159
Yep, she finally nailed him.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.860
Poor tommie. She's had
her sights set on him

13:15.895 --> 13:16.995
since the 10th grade.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.747
She hated you for dating him
all through high school.

13:19.783 --> 13:22.116
She couldn't still hold
that against me, could she?

13:22.169 --> 13:26.337
Please, that woman holds more
beef than a meat locker.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.206
I've been drooling ever
since you said "fries."

13:28.241 --> 13:29.457
let's go in.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.043
Fair warning:
It's seen better days.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.803
What happened?

13:41.855 --> 13:44.255
Nothing, literally.

13:44.274 --> 13:46.808
Sheesh...

13:46.860 --> 13:49.561
The menu hasn't
changed either.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.780
Oscar's on-going love
affair with saturated fats.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.434
Cat?

13:56.453 --> 13:59.704
Oscar! I didn't think
you'd remember me.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.707
What, our best waitress ever?

14:02.742 --> 14:03.958
What are you doing here?

14:03.994 --> 14:07.045
Visiting my favorite peeps.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.164
Oh yes, the three amigas.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.800
So nice to see you
all together again.

14:12.836 --> 14:15.253
So tell me, what're
you up to these days?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.472
Head chef at a
restaurant in la.

14:17.507 --> 14:19.224
Head chef?

14:19.259 --> 14:21.643
I knew it, I just knew it!

14:21.678 --> 14:23.811
I taught her
everything she knows.

14:23.847 --> 14:25.980
We thought we'd come in for
a bite, for old time's sake.

14:26.016 --> 14:28.066
I'm glad you did,
because I might not be here

14:28.101 --> 14:30.568
next time you're in town.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.687
I bought a condo
in cape coral.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.305
Nice.

14:34.324 --> 14:36.190
So girls, what will it be?

14:36.243 --> 14:37.859
And it's on me.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.911
Do you really have to ask?

14:39.946 --> 14:41.663
Coming right up.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.116
He's still so sweet...

14:46.986 --> 14:49.420
Three oscar specials.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.455
Thank you.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.923
There go my hips.

14:51.958 --> 14:52.990
Enjoy!

14:53.009 --> 14:54.709
I can't believe we
used to eat like this.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.211
Maybe we should pick up
some kale on the way home,

14:57.264 --> 15:00.164
tell our stomachs we were
just kidding about the fries.

15:00.183 --> 15:02.684
Well, what do you know?

15:02.719 --> 15:04.602
The living dead.

15:04.638 --> 15:05.687
Play nice.

15:05.722 --> 15:08.056
-Don't I always?
-No.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.476
Peyton curzon!
Gosh, it's been forever.

15:11.511 --> 15:16.064
Riley, sarah, catherine.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.117
It's not curzon,
it's clark.

15:19.152 --> 15:22.787
Oh that's right, I heard
that you landed tommie.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.489
It warmed my heart.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.707
Really?

15:25.742 --> 15:26.874
Oh yeah, you bet.

15:26.910 --> 15:30.712
It is nice to know that hard
work and determination

15:30.747 --> 15:33.247
really do pay off in the end.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.166
You here for lunch?

15:35.201 --> 15:37.468
Please... No.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.588
Just dropping off
a business proposal.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.207
What are you two
doing in town?

15:43.226 --> 15:45.259
Remembering old times.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.812
I would have thought
you'd want to forget them.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.988
You'd think after all these
years she would've had

15:57.023 --> 15:59.691
a personality transplant
to go with those implants.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.493
Forget her, the burgers
are getting cold.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.611
Enough small talk,

16:03.663 --> 16:06.197
how are things with
you and ethan?

16:08.618 --> 16:10.585
He moved out a few weeks ago.

16:13.206 --> 16:16.624
And you didn't call
us on that day?

16:16.676 --> 16:19.927
I was in shock,
I still am.

16:19.963 --> 16:21.379
What happened?

16:22.716 --> 16:27.051
I don't know, a few months ago
he started acting strange.

16:27.086 --> 16:30.054
Weird things like he
started dressing better.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.056
Working out?

16:32.091 --> 16:35.810
To "protect his heart."

16:35.862 --> 16:37.228
at first I didn't
think anything of it

16:37.263 --> 16:39.814
and then one night he
came home really late

16:39.866 --> 16:42.884
and I jokingly said
something about him

16:42.919 --> 16:45.370
having an affair
and then he just...

16:45.405 --> 16:49.207
He didn't laugh.
At all.

16:49.242 --> 16:52.377
I got chills and
I thought maybe

16:52.412 --> 16:55.780
he really is having an
affair, so I asked him.

16:55.799 --> 16:57.882
And he lied like
a congressman?

16:57.917 --> 17:01.786
Nope... He fessed up.

17:01.805 --> 17:05.139
It's like he was
almost relieved.

17:05.175 --> 17:06.891
How long has it
been going on?

17:06.926 --> 17:08.726
Couple of months.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.462
Met some customer at work.

17:11.481 --> 17:13.014
He said he was sorry.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.800
He didn't mean to
hurt me, et cetera.

17:15.819 --> 17:18.186
And you kicked him to the
curb that night, right?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.188
No, I was numb.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.490
He was the one that
wanted time apart.

17:22.525 --> 17:24.192
I agreed.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.077
Now we're in
marriage counseling.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.413
My advice: He's a jerk.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.615
Cut the cord, cut him loose.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.166
It's not that easy, riley.

17:32.202 --> 17:34.619
She's got hannah
to think about.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.371
How is she taking it all?

17:37.424 --> 17:39.707
She's miserable,
she wants her dad.

17:39.759 --> 17:40.708
I'm a mess.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.345
I've got this book
due in January

17:44.380 --> 17:45.963
that my publisher
is asking about.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.433
It's a christmas story
of all things.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.802
What am I supposed to write?

17:50.837 --> 17:54.272
"hey kids, santa's
cheating on mrs. Claus

17:54.307 --> 17:56.340
when he's working
in the toy shop?

17:56.359 --> 17:59.227
Sarah, that's awful.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.847
The worst part about it
is that I want him back.

18:02.866 --> 18:06.117
If he has any sense at all,
he'll come crawling back.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.519
I say good riddance
to bad news.

18:08.538 --> 18:09.620
He cheated on you.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.542
It hurts, it hurts a lot.

18:15.879 --> 18:18.830
I just hope he's home by
christmas for hannah's sake.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.940
We're here for you, sarah.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.391
So what do you want to do?

18:30.426 --> 18:32.026
Wanna go watch a movie?

18:32.061 --> 18:33.945
Maybe go to the mall?

18:33.980 --> 18:37.365
Get some gin and tonic and
start cocktail hour early?

18:37.400 --> 18:39.283
You guys are gonna
think this is silly.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.651
We won't.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.571
I want to decorate
the house for christmas.

18:43.606 --> 18:46.073
We could drape it in black
and put up a sign that says:

18:46.108 --> 18:48.242
This hunk of coal brought
to you by ethan miller.

18:48.277 --> 18:50.461
Riley, I don't think
that's gonna cheer her up.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.247
I'm serious, my favorite
childhood memories

18:53.282 --> 18:54.532
are christmases with you guys.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.917
You're only here
for the weekend.

18:55.952 --> 18:57.051
It's now or never.

18:57.086 --> 18:58.953
I vote for now.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.138
Two conditions.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.623
One, we don't play that
schmaltzy christmas music.

19:02.642 --> 19:07.145
Oh my gosh, fine:
One condition.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.729
Cat bakes her
christmas cookies.

19:08.765 --> 19:11.682
Hey, you had me at
schmaltzy christmas music.

20:01.851 --> 20:05.286
Hey, do you have our old
stockings for the mantel?

20:05.321 --> 20:08.990
They are cleverly hidden in
that box marked "stockings."

20:09.025 --> 20:12.293
box marked "stockings,"
there we are.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.167
Strange, that's not
how I remembered them.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.370
Now that tells you
everything you need to know

20:23.389 --> 20:24.972
about ethan's filing system.

20:25.008 --> 20:27.008
Talk about careless.

20:27.043 --> 20:29.877
It's a miracle he could pull off
an affair.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.378
Don't worry, the
stockings are probably

20:31.397 --> 20:34.181
in a box somewhere
marked "trophies."

20:35.485 --> 20:36.350
wow.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.396
It's a little droopy
on the right.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.032
Careful!

20:51.067 --> 20:52.366
I know what I'm doing.

20:52.401 --> 20:53.918
All right, good.

20:53.953 --> 20:54.869
Now just come down.

20:54.904 --> 20:55.836
Be careful!

20:55.872 --> 20:57.237
Stop saying that,
I'm fine!

20:57.257 --> 20:58.873
I just don't want
you to get...

21:01.243 --> 21:02.293
...Hurt.

21:05.381 --> 21:06.681
Ouch.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.145
Well, the good news
it's not broken.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.030
That's a relief.

21:23.066 --> 21:24.532
I'll wrap it,
give you some crutches

21:24.567 --> 21:25.700
and you can be
on your way.

21:25.735 --> 21:26.867
Okay.

21:26.903 --> 21:29.370
That's what I get for
stringing christmas lights.

21:29.405 --> 21:30.655
You have a house here?

21:30.707 --> 21:32.707
No, I'm visiting a friend.

21:32.742 --> 21:35.209
Sarah michaels,
over on holly lane?

21:35.244 --> 21:36.443
Your old hangout.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.879
How would you...

21:38.915 --> 21:40.447
Do I know you?

21:40.466 --> 21:42.917
We had honors
english together.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.754
Three years running.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.893
Jake allen.

21:52.929 --> 21:55.930
Wow... You really shot up!

21:55.965 --> 21:57.431
Late bloomer!

21:57.466 --> 21:59.150
Gained five inches in college.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.985
That's possible?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.436
Apparently.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.606
I'm glad I was
on duty tonight.

22:05.641 --> 22:07.325
I've wanted to thank you
for a long time.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.593
Thank me for what?

22:09.629 --> 22:12.997
Changing my life.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.665
Excuse me?

22:14.701 --> 22:17.118
I need to get that bandage,
I'll be right back.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.543
I feel terrible.

22:25.595 --> 22:28.879
It's not like you pushed
her off the roof.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.931
I can't remember what
I have at home for pain.

22:30.967 --> 22:32.933
I'm sure the hospital
will take care of it.

22:32.969 --> 22:34.168
There's a pharmacy
down the hall.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.137
I'm just gonna go
grab something.

22:41.444 --> 22:46.480
<i> [cell phone ringing]</i>

22:46.515 --> 22:48.315
taylor!

22:48.350 --> 22:49.984
Hello?

22:52.354 --> 22:53.738
Taylor?

22:58.494 --> 22:59.827
It was debate club.

22:59.862 --> 23:03.547
The subject: Should community
service be mandatory?

23:03.583 --> 23:05.082
What side was I on?

23:05.134 --> 23:06.667
Pro.

23:06.702 --> 23:09.420
You made such a
compelling case:

23:09.472 --> 23:11.972
Meet new people,
learn new skills,

23:12.008 --> 23:16.310
broaden your horizons,
make the world a better place.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.598
I spent that summer
volunteering at a hospital.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.183
Here in kirkwood falls?

23:22.218 --> 23:23.651
Honduras.

23:23.686 --> 23:27.938
Wow, you took "broaden your
horizons" to the heart.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.524
Because of you,
I became a doctor.

23:31.527 --> 23:32.860
Because of me?

23:32.895 --> 23:35.196
Yep. Besides
practicing here,

23:35.231 --> 23:36.697
I spend several
weeks a year

23:36.732 --> 23:39.366
volunteering for
doctors without borders.

23:39.401 --> 23:41.568
So still broadening?

23:41.587 --> 23:45.039
Does as much for me
as the people I help.

23:45.074 --> 23:48.075
So... What have
you been up to?

23:48.094 --> 23:50.410
Oh, so much.

23:50.430 --> 23:53.297
I live in new york, I help
people do some things,

23:53.349 --> 23:55.749
improve their circumstances.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.519
So, social work?

23:58.554 --> 24:00.888
Oh, it can be social.

24:00.923 --> 24:03.691
If there's enough drinking.

24:03.726 --> 24:06.861
But let's not
talk about work.

24:06.896 --> 24:08.195
Feels really good.

24:08.231 --> 24:09.363
It should be
good in no time.

24:09.398 --> 24:12.399
Okay... Thank you.

24:12.434 --> 24:13.734
You're welcome.

24:13.769 --> 24:16.070
Are you having
fun at ashley's?

24:17.707 --> 24:19.240
Who else is there?

24:20.943 --> 24:23.744
Those don't sound
like girls' voices.

24:26.249 --> 24:27.915
You didn't tell me
about any party

24:27.950 --> 24:29.633
and that there would
be boys there.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.002
Put ashley's mother
on the phone.

24:34.290 --> 24:36.724
Did I just hear somebody
say "pass me a beer?"

24:36.759 --> 24:38.342
are you kids drinking?

24:38.394 --> 24:41.145

you doing here?

24:58.314 --> 24:59.980
Hannah's fine,
riley sprained her ankle.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.315
What're you doing here?

25:01.334 --> 25:03.751
I umm... Just
grabbing some stuff.

25:03.786 --> 25:05.119
Ethan, I got it.

25:05.154 --> 25:07.121
I really don't think the
second test is necessary,

25:07.156 --> 25:09.006
but the pharmacist claims this
is the most reliable brand,

25:09.041 --> 25:10.541
so...

25:10.593 --> 25:11.959
Hi, I'm britney.

25:14.447 --> 25:16.714
You want to explain?

25:38.187 --> 25:39.519
Hey.

25:39.539 --> 25:40.621
You okay?

25:40.656 --> 25:42.489
Yeah, just a sprain.

25:47.363 --> 25:49.630
Why do you two look like
somebody stole your puppy?

25:49.665 --> 25:52.166
My 13 year old daughter
is at an unsupervised party

25:52.201 --> 25:54.134
with boys and beer.

25:54.170 --> 25:55.202
Yikes.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.037
My husband's girlfriend
is pregnant,

25:57.056 --> 25:59.356
so I imagine marriage
counseling won't work.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.824
Are you kidding me?

26:04.847 --> 26:07.815
And I feel like my entire
life has been a waste.

26:07.850 --> 26:08.933
I don't know about you,

26:08.985 --> 26:11.602
but I could stand
to drown some sorrows.

26:11.654 --> 26:12.436
Me too.

26:12.488 --> 26:13.320
Me three.

26:13.356 --> 26:14.605
What'll it be, ladies?

26:14.657 --> 26:17.474
Wine, ice cream, fries?

26:17.510 --> 26:19.526
-Yes.
-All of it.

26:19.561 --> 26:21.362
Yeah, all of it.

26:27.203 --> 26:29.286
<i> Things keep getting worse.</i>

26:29.322 --> 26:31.705
What would I do
without you guys?

26:31.741 --> 26:34.575
Eat all this food without us.

26:34.610 --> 26:37.094
I wish that you
guys lived closer.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.079
You know, I didn't
even want to move to la.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.297
It was nick's idea.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.883
Really? It looks so
inviting every time

26:42.918 --> 26:44.468
I watch it on
the rose parade.

26:44.503 --> 26:47.671
There's two seasons:
Fire and floods.

26:47.706 --> 26:49.706
The traffic is a nightmare

26:49.725 --> 26:52.259
and the smog in the
sky looks like muck.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.878
But what really
worries me is taylor,

26:54.897 --> 26:56.480
or rather, her friends.

26:56.515 --> 26:57.881
Kids have phases.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.316
No, it's not that.

26:59.352 --> 27:01.602
Her friends' parents
are one percenters.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.720
All the kids, they
have credit cards.

27:03.739 --> 27:06.991
And they vacation
in Italy and maui.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.226
And taylor buys
into it all of it.

27:09.245 --> 27:11.745
Well at least you have
a job that you like.

27:11.781 --> 27:14.999
I work for a degenerate
gambler who raids the till

27:15.034 --> 27:17.668
to fund his love
of texas hold-em.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.536
Bad business model.

27:19.571 --> 27:22.923
I'm hoping we don't close
down before christmas.

27:22.958 --> 27:27.294
You're a great chef,
you'll find another job.

27:27.346 --> 27:30.014
Nick and I were so close
to opening our own place.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.716
That was always the dream.

27:32.751 --> 27:35.719
He was driving to scout a
location when...

27:39.758 --> 27:41.809
The accident.

27:41.844 --> 27:45.396
It's still one day
at a time for me.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.032
Meanwhile, I'm no
closer to that dream

27:48.067 --> 27:50.367
and I'm watching my
daughter slip away.

27:50.403 --> 27:53.070
At least your job
makes people happy.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.074
You know what I do?

27:57.109 --> 28:00.794
Look for companies
to rape and pillage.

28:00.830 --> 28:02.946
It can't be that bad.

28:02.965 --> 28:04.631
I'm turning in a
report on Monday

28:04.667 --> 28:07.334
recommending that we
purchase a company in ohio.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.952
Been in business 80 years:

28:08.971 --> 28:10.471
You want to know
what's gonna happen?

28:10.506 --> 28:12.306
We'll borrow a ton of
money to purchase it,

28:12.341 --> 28:14.224
and then stick the
company with the debt.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.144
Then we will streamline
the workforce,

28:17.179 --> 28:19.796
which means fire people who've
been working there for decades.

28:19.815 --> 28:22.983
After we've wrung
out every last dime,

28:23.018 --> 28:25.986
we'll chop it up and
sell the profitable bits,

28:26.021 --> 28:27.905
or declare bankruptcy,

28:27.940 --> 28:32.242
charging outrageous fees
every step of the way.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.610
That's pretty bad...

28:33.645 --> 28:35.362
Yeah.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.364
I'm good at what I do,
but I hate what I do,

28:37.416 --> 28:40.167
but if I didn't do what I do,
what would I do?

28:40.202 --> 28:42.119
Say that three times fast.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.540
I'm serious.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.675
I have locked that in a box

28:48.711 --> 28:50.711
and hid it from
myself for so long

28:50.763 --> 28:52.513
and then talking to jake

28:52.548 --> 28:55.933
about all that he's
done with his life

28:55.968 --> 29:00.354
just opened it up and
shined a light right in there.

29:02.691 --> 29:04.674
Well, until a few weeks ago,

29:04.693 --> 29:09.196
my life was exactly
how I pictured it.

29:09.231 --> 29:12.699
And then it all fell to pieces.

29:12.735 --> 29:15.536
How am I supposed to
tell hannah not only

29:15.571 --> 29:17.905
is her dad not coming
home for christmas,

29:17.957 --> 29:20.574
he's spending it with
his other family?

29:24.797 --> 29:27.714
She's 13, you could text her?

29:30.719 --> 29:33.987
There's no easy way, sarah.

29:34.023 --> 29:36.640
I hate ethan for doing this.

29:36.675 --> 29:38.258
As you should.

29:41.814 --> 29:45.399
There's no other option,
we're getting a divorce.

29:45.434 --> 29:46.683
I have to sell the house.

29:46.718 --> 29:47.734
What? No!

29:47.770 --> 29:48.769
No!

29:48.821 --> 29:50.437
All of our money is
tied up in this.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.405
I can't buy him out.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.357
But this is our house, too.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.108
We can't let that happen!

29:55.144 --> 29:56.860
I don't have a choice.

30:01.283 --> 30:04.618
This is gonna be the last
christmas on holly lane.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.541
I don't want to
drink to that...

30:10.576 --> 30:11.508
I know.

30:11.544 --> 30:14.178
[glasses clink]

30:20.936 --> 30:22.052
<i> [riley]</i>
<i> morning.</i>

30:22.087 --> 30:24.188
Morning.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.473
Coffee's made.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.258
How long have you been up?

30:28.277 --> 30:29.109
Couple hours.

30:30.613 --> 30:32.479
Did somebody say coffee?

30:32.531 --> 30:33.930
I'm making some more.

30:33.949 --> 30:35.649
Well, you better step on it

30:35.701 --> 30:38.402
because we have to get
dressed and get going.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.237
I hate peppy morning people.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.039
I've been thinking
about your problem.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.074
You're going to kill
britney for me?

30:44.109 --> 30:45.075
No.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.126
Ethan?

30:46.161 --> 30:48.545
Sorry, I haven't figured
out a way to fix that yet.

30:48.581 --> 30:50.447
I meant cat.

30:50.466 --> 30:53.250
My problem? Which one?

30:53.285 --> 30:54.751
All of them.

30:54.787 --> 30:56.837
The answer is right
around the corner.

31:01.126 --> 31:02.559
Well, what do you think?

31:02.595 --> 31:04.811
I think you're two tacos
short of a combo meal.

31:04.847 --> 31:08.315
Let's consider: You hate your
job, your boss, the drive,

31:08.350 --> 31:10.684
los angeles, and all of
that loathsome sunshine.

31:10.736 --> 31:12.853
Ours not to reason why.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.689
Two: You're worried it's
warping your daughter's values.

31:15.741 --> 31:19.860
And three: You've always wanted
to own your own restaurant.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.946
She was captain
of the debate team.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.451
Let's check it out.

31:29.338 --> 31:32.122
[whispering]

31:35.427 --> 31:36.426
well?

31:37.630 --> 31:39.996
The equipment
is in good shape.

31:40.015 --> 31:41.998
But?

31:42.017 --> 31:43.634
It's fine.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.669
Fine? We're not
talking about fine,

31:45.688 --> 31:49.356
we're talking
about your dream.

31:49.391 --> 31:51.341
I'd want to put
in a pizza oven

31:51.360 --> 31:55.145
and open the kitchen wall to
the rest of the dining area.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.648
So we could
open up some walls.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.199
What about this room?

31:59.234 --> 32:01.535
Well it's like me, it
could use a facelift.

32:01.570 --> 32:03.704
[chuckles]

32:03.739 --> 32:06.990
paint, new tables, flooring.

32:07.025 --> 32:09.126
What if you moved the
main entrance to the back,

32:09.161 --> 32:10.026
off the main road?

32:10.045 --> 32:12.629
Yeah, and maybe we
could put in a bar.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.381
Give it a gastropub feel.

32:14.416 --> 32:15.582
I love that.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.884
So...?

32:17.920 --> 32:20.420
I can see it.

32:20.472 --> 32:23.006
Peyton clark dropped off a
business proposal yesterday.

32:23.041 --> 32:26.426
She's after me to list the
place, says she has a buyer.

32:26.462 --> 32:27.594
To do what?

32:27.646 --> 32:30.263
Says there's money
in parking lots.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.849
They would demolish
this place?

32:32.884 --> 32:37.321
If cat bought it, it would be
like keeping it in the family.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.022
You can afford
to do this, cat?

32:39.057 --> 32:39.990
Ha.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.443
I plan to line up an investor.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.895
What I need from you,
oscar, is a fair price.

32:45.914 --> 32:48.565
Keeping in mind that
if you sell to us,

32:48.584 --> 32:52.085
you wouldn't need to pay
any realtor's commissions.

32:52.121 --> 32:54.421
Peyton will turn
blue and implode.

32:54.456 --> 32:56.373
Yeah.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.793
Do you want to sit down
and talk about it?

32:59.845 --> 33:00.877
Okay.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.810
Okay, assignments.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.311
Sarah, I want you
to find a contractor

33:18.364 --> 33:19.446
to check out the building.

33:19.481 --> 33:22.733
Cat, draw up some sample
menus with price points.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.117
I'm gonna write
the business plan.

33:24.153 --> 33:26.870
You really think you can talk
your boss into funding this?

33:26.905 --> 33:28.605
If the numbers are solid.

33:28.624 --> 33:30.040
We're moving too fast.

33:30.075 --> 33:33.276
We wait, and your dreams
become a parking lot.

33:33.295 --> 33:35.495
I've never done
anything like this.

33:35.547 --> 33:38.782
That's the point:
This is your chance.

33:38.801 --> 33:40.667
You just have to ask yourself:
Two years from now,

33:40.719 --> 33:42.619
do you want to be in la
working for someone else,

33:42.638 --> 33:44.671
or do you want to be out
here with your own place?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.423
And then there's this:

33:46.458 --> 33:48.759
Sarah gets to have one of
her best buds back in town,

33:48.794 --> 33:52.295
and I get to help a
friend realize her dream.

33:52.314 --> 33:54.564
Could taylor and I stay
with you at first?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.983
Yes of course, as long
as I have the house.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.605
-Bye!
-Bye.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.384
Your bff's gone?

34:31.437 --> 34:34.471
Yeah, it's already too
quiet around here.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.556
Why don't you sit down
and have some tea?

34:36.608 --> 34:39.476
Uh oh. Now what?

34:39.511 --> 34:41.978
Well, a couple of things.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.313
One of them is good.

34:43.348 --> 34:46.099
Cat and taylor might be coming
to stay with us for awhile.

34:46.135 --> 34:47.984
What? When?

34:48.019 --> 34:49.319
I'm not sure, maybe soon.

34:49.354 --> 34:51.021
For how long?

34:51.056 --> 34:54.174
I'm not sure about that either.

34:54.209 --> 34:55.725
What about dad?

34:58.297 --> 34:59.980
About your dad...

35:17.616 --> 35:19.916
I cannot believe you actually
went into ashley's house

35:19.952 --> 35:21.084
and made a scene!

35:21.120 --> 35:23.703
And I can't believe ashley's
mom was actually home.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.006
And it wasn't a scene,
it was a discussion.

35:26.041 --> 35:27.124
And it doesn't matter anyway

35:27.159 --> 35:28.758
because you are never
going back there.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.961
And you are certainly not
going to maui for christmas

35:30.996 --> 35:31.962
with those people.

35:31.997 --> 35:35.215
You're insane! No
one else is in trouble!

35:35.267 --> 35:37.500
I don't care about anybody
else, I care about you.

35:37.519 --> 35:39.136
I hate you!

35:46.511 --> 35:49.479
It's going slower
than I thought...

35:51.200 --> 35:53.150
An idea for the story?

35:54.786 --> 35:56.019
Gosh, you know what?

35:56.038 --> 35:58.872
The thing is I really
don't like to talk about it

35:58.907 --> 36:01.524
until the idea
is fully formed.

36:01.543 --> 36:04.628
Just hang tight,
you're gonna love it.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.046
Okay.

36:29.438 --> 36:31.488
Chef?

36:31.523 --> 36:32.689
What's the matter?

36:32.724 --> 36:34.691
You're gonna have to
change the menu again.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.026
More vendor problems?

36:36.061 --> 36:37.527
Afraid so.

rate on restaurants is?

37:25.110 --> 37:27.744
The start-up is nothing,
it's a drop in the bucket.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.713
Do you know how you
get a full bucket?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.881
By not making
dumb investments.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.217
We have a great location,
a great chef,

37:34.253 --> 37:35.585
the numbers are solid.

37:35.620 --> 37:39.072
We? What is this,
a personal project?

37:39.107 --> 37:40.840
It's a safe investment, sir.

37:40.876 --> 37:43.593
So are cds at one
and a half percent.

37:43.628 --> 37:46.730
Not our business model.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.133
No, our model is to find
distressed companies,

37:50.152 --> 37:52.235
screw the workforce,
cannibalize the parts,

37:52.271 --> 37:55.138
suck it dry and collect
a fat management fee.

37:55.157 --> 37:58.275
Vulture capitalism
at its best.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.466
<i> I've got good news</i>
<i> and bad news.</i>

38:06.501 --> 38:08.018
Bad news first.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.370
My boss turned
down the proposal.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.038
What's the good news?

38:12.090 --> 38:14.207
I got fired.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.158
Fired?

38:15.177 --> 38:17.260
How is that good news?

38:17.296 --> 38:20.163
I get a honking big
severance check.

38:20.182 --> 38:21.931
Okay, so yay?

38:21.967 --> 38:23.466
Yes, yay.

38:23.501 --> 38:25.635
I'm going to finance
your restaurant!

38:25.670 --> 38:27.187
Riley, you can't.

38:27.222 --> 38:30.473
For once I want to put my money
into something I believe in.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.108
And I believe in us.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.978
That is, if you'll
have me as a partner.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.030
But you're risking your money.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.983
You cook the food,
I'll cook the books.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.070
Kidding, people.

38:44.122 --> 38:47.040
I think you need to
work on your delivery.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.291
One more thing.

38:48.327 --> 38:49.559
What's that?

38:49.594 --> 38:52.162
I'm gonna need a place to stay
until we get this thing going.

38:52.197 --> 38:55.465
So sarah, got room
for one more?

38:55.500 --> 38:58.635
With one caveat: Ethan
hired a real estate agent

38:58.670 --> 39:00.036
to list the house.

39:00.055 --> 39:01.888
Do you want to guess who?

39:01.923 --> 39:03.056
[groans]

39:04.760 --> 39:06.926
what a truly lovely
home you have.

39:06.978 --> 39:07.894
Thank you.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.596
And so merry.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.147
Despite the circumstances.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.649
Needless to say,
I'm sorry.

39:12.684 --> 39:13.716
Uh huh.

39:13.735 --> 39:15.068
Beautiful stonework.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.887
My grandfather did that himself
when he built the house.

39:17.906 --> 39:20.273
Your grandparents lived
here before your parents?

39:20.308 --> 39:21.908
They did.

39:21.943 --> 39:25.912
Perfect! I can advertise
it as first time on market.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.248
Any idea how quickly it'll sell?

39:28.283 --> 39:30.083
You only need one buyer.

39:30.118 --> 39:33.286
However, I do have a few
suggestions that will help.

39:33.338 --> 39:34.621
Okay.

39:34.673 --> 39:37.374
First, you need to declutter.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.626
Declutter?

39:39.678 --> 39:42.212
Make it less personal.

39:42.247 --> 39:45.131
It is personal,
it's my home.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.450
The fewer photos and
mementos you have on display,

39:47.486 --> 39:49.636
the easier it is
for buyers to envision

39:49.671 --> 39:52.839
themselves being
here and not you.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.359
As for the holiday decorations--

39:56.395 --> 39:57.477
they're staying.

39:57.529 --> 39:58.878
Of course.

39:58.914 --> 40:00.730
But you may want to
pull back a little.

40:00.765 --> 40:03.867
You don't want the place looking
like a bad christmas sweater.

40:03.902 --> 40:07.871
I like christmas sweaters,
I think they're fun.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.540
Whatever, at least ethan
has his things out

40:10.575 --> 40:12.608
so your closets look spacious.

40:12.627 --> 40:14.077
Keep them that way.

40:14.112 --> 40:17.213
Not likely... I'm
getting roommates.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.083
Who?

40:25.257 --> 40:26.423
Taylor!

40:26.458 --> 40:27.590
I'm not moving!

40:27.625 --> 40:28.675
Taylor--

40:28.727 --> 40:30.176
I'm not!

40:30.228 --> 40:31.895
My job is in jeopardy.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.229
So? Find another one.

40:33.265 --> 40:35.465
I did, in kirkwood falls.

40:35.484 --> 40:37.484
This is a really big
opportunity for me.

40:37.519 --> 40:39.436
Well it stinks for me!

40:39.471 --> 40:40.803
One of the reasons
I'm doing this

40:40.822 --> 40:42.906
is so that we can spend
more time together.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.307
Big whoop.

40:44.326 --> 40:45.909
Well, I would like that.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.995
Well I wouldn't if it means
living in stupid kirkwood falls.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.830
You can't make me go!

40:52.951 --> 40:53.917
Taylor look!

40:53.952 --> 40:55.251
Doesn't the house
look so pretty

40:55.287 --> 40:56.419
with all the lights
and decorations?

40:56.455 --> 40:59.622
I was supposed to be in maui,
not suckwood falls.

40:59.657 --> 41:01.624
I'm not really
feeling the joy.

41:01.659 --> 41:03.176
Hi, welcome!

41:03.211 --> 41:04.461
Remember me?

41:04.496 --> 41:07.213
Taylor, do you remember
riley and sarah?

41:07.265 --> 41:08.515
She's the one that
wrote all the

41:08.550 --> 41:11.100
woof and luce
books you like.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.269
When I was five.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.388
This is hannah.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.273
You guys will
be sharing a room.

41:17.309 --> 41:20.310
Sharing? Wow, this
just keeps getting better.

41:20.345 --> 41:21.561
Not forever.

41:21.613 --> 41:24.013
Just until I help your mom get
the restaurant up and running.

41:24.032 --> 41:26.149
The restaurant could burn
to the ground for all I care.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.484
Taylor!

41:27.519 --> 41:30.737
What? It's your
dream, not mine.

41:30.789 --> 41:31.871
I need to pee.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.661
It's a big change for her.

41:38.696 --> 41:40.330
And not for me?

41:43.084 --> 41:45.051
Merry christmas,
one and all.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.056
Could you bring the bags
in, please?

41:50.091 --> 41:51.508
Sure thing...

41:53.345 --> 41:55.512
It's gonna be
balmy in here.

42:02.103 --> 42:03.486
That wall isn't load-bearing.

42:03.522 --> 42:04.988
Moving things around
won't be a problem.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.407
Good, because I have
one tiny little wrinkle.

42:07.442 --> 42:10.026
There's always a wrinkle.

42:10.061 --> 42:12.445
We really need to open
before christmas.

42:12.497 --> 42:13.446
Before christmas?

42:13.498 --> 42:15.582
We need a revenue
stream, streaming.

42:15.617 --> 42:16.833
Is that possible?

42:16.868 --> 42:18.284
Anything's possible.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.954
Do you want it fast,
cheap, or good?

42:21.006 --> 42:22.238
All three?

42:22.257 --> 42:24.040
Sorry, you only get two.

42:24.075 --> 42:26.676
If you want it good and fast,
it won't be cheap.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.912
And if you want it cheap
and good, it won't be fast.

42:29.931 --> 42:33.633
And if you want it fast
and cheap, it won't be good.

42:33.685 --> 42:36.886
Well, it has to be on budget
and it has to be on time.

42:36.921 --> 42:38.388
I'll make it as good as I can.

42:38.423 --> 42:39.355
Okay.

42:39.391 --> 42:41.224
I'll call you in a few hours.

42:43.761 --> 42:46.529
Why do I get the feeling this is
gonna be slow, costly, and bad?

42:46.565 --> 42:47.814
Bite your tongue!

42:47.866 --> 42:49.115
Riley?

42:50.318 --> 42:52.118
Oh hey, jake.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.237
What's going on? I heard
oscar sold the place.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.906
Yeah, to us.

42:56.941 --> 42:58.908
How's the ankle?

42:58.943 --> 43:00.660
Great yeah.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.545
You must've had
a good doctor.

43:02.581 --> 43:04.330
I did, thank you.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.916
So what're you
doing in town?

43:06.951 --> 43:10.253
We are doing so much,
it's a little bit complicated.

43:10.288 --> 43:14.841
Why don't you explain
it over dinner?

43:14.893 --> 43:15.975
Dinner?

43:16.011 --> 43:17.727
How about tonight?

43:17.762 --> 43:19.479
Umm, I would love to.

43:19.514 --> 43:24.350
We have to... We're gonna
meet susie, but we--

43:24.402 --> 43:25.801
I can totally take
care of that thing.

43:25.820 --> 43:28.071
Don't worry about the thing,
we don't need her at the thing.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.305
Thanks, sarah, cat.

43:29.324 --> 43:31.608
Good to see you both.

43:31.643 --> 43:33.443
So... Dinner?

43:33.478 --> 43:35.695
Sure, why not?
Dinner.

43:35.747 --> 43:37.530
Can I pick you up?

43:37.582 --> 43:40.116
Uh, I'll meet you there.

43:40.151 --> 43:42.485
How about sunsinger's at eight?

43:42.504 --> 43:45.371
Great, see you at eight.

43:45.423 --> 43:46.822
Great.

43:46.841 --> 43:48.925
-Bye.
-Bye!

43:52.931 --> 43:53.930
What're you doing?

43:53.965 --> 43:55.965
We're trying to help you.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.433
Yeah, he's nice.

43:57.469 --> 43:58.468
Too nice!

43:58.503 --> 43:59.886
Why do I wanna spend
time with someone

43:59.938 --> 44:01.604
that makes me feel bad
for not being mother teresa?

44:01.640 --> 44:03.640
Because you like him!

44:04.643 --> 44:07.226
You don't know that, okay?

44:07.278 --> 44:10.063
So you two need
to stop meddling.

44:16.421 --> 44:19.205
I'm guessing that wasn't up
to new york city standards.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.507
I don't know, the miso
roasted brussel sprouts

44:21.543 --> 44:23.259
were pretty great.

44:23.294 --> 44:25.011
Have you noticed
how brussel sprouts

44:25.046 --> 44:26.512
were universally despised
until two years ago

44:26.548 --> 44:28.214
and now they're the
cool kids on the plate?

44:28.249 --> 44:30.216
Yeah, it's like they
shed their nerdiness

44:30.251 --> 44:34.354
and showed up at their class
reunion driving ferraris.

44:34.389 --> 44:38.691
I'm so glad I didn't pick you
up tonight in my not-a-ferrari.

44:38.727 --> 44:41.511
That's not important to me.

44:41.546 --> 44:43.896
It's a hybrid electric.

44:43.931 --> 44:46.399
Of course it is.

44:46.434 --> 44:48.484
More wine?

44:48.536 --> 44:51.371
I better not, I
have to drive home.

44:54.242 --> 44:56.042
You haven't even
touched yours.

44:56.077 --> 44:58.161
I'm on call.

44:58.213 --> 45:00.847
So why did you order it?

45:02.617 --> 45:05.585
So you wouldn't feel
bad drinking alone.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.336
[laughs]

45:07.389 --> 45:10.673
please tell me
there's at least one

45:10.725 --> 45:12.592
thoughtless, irresponsible
thing that you do.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.227
Just one.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.435
I hate to admit how
often I've gone

45:22.470 --> 45:25.154
to the grocery store and
forgotten to bring my own bags.

45:25.190 --> 45:27.190
[loud laughter]

45:27.859 --> 45:30.493
this string of
lights looks good.

45:30.528 --> 45:32.695
You know what? Let's be
sure to check for duds.

45:32.747 --> 45:35.198
Good idea, we don't want to
get all the way to the top

45:35.250 --> 45:36.816
and discover we
have a bad bulb.

45:36.835 --> 45:39.035
You're supposed
to start at the top.

45:39.087 --> 45:40.403
What?

45:40.438 --> 45:42.038
Stringing the lights.

45:42.090 --> 45:43.923
Starting at the
bottom is wrong.

45:43.958 --> 45:44.824
Hannah--

45:44.843 --> 45:46.776
dad always starts
at the top.

45:48.513 --> 45:51.097
We'll start at the top.

45:51.132 --> 45:52.799
I don't want to
do this anyway.

45:52.834 --> 45:54.267
Do whatever you want.

45:57.188 --> 46:00.056
She normally does
the tree with ethan.

46:00.108 --> 46:01.691
If she doesn't
have to do this,

46:01.726 --> 46:03.693
I shouldn't have
to do it either.

46:04.896 --> 46:07.897
All right, can this christmas
get any less merry?

46:08.683 --> 46:12.034
So you're going back
to the hospital tonight?

46:12.070 --> 46:13.653
We're short-handed.

46:13.688 --> 46:14.737
Why's that?

46:14.789 --> 46:16.622
Little bit of a hard time
recruiting good help.

46:16.658 --> 46:19.742
Most doctors want to
practice in a big city.

46:19.794 --> 46:21.077
You're here.

46:21.129 --> 46:22.545
I like kirkwood falls.

46:22.580 --> 46:23.913
It's my way of giving back.

46:23.965 --> 46:25.164
Thank you.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.499
It's your fault
for giving that

46:26.534 --> 46:30.419
"make a difference" speech when
I was young and impressionable.

46:30.472 --> 46:32.472
I guess now is not
the best time to tell you

46:32.507 --> 46:35.258
that I just wanted to win.

46:35.310 --> 46:38.177
Not surprising for a future
private equity hot shot.

46:41.149 --> 46:43.483
Google.

46:43.518 --> 46:45.601
Don't believe everything
you read on the internet.

46:45.653 --> 46:48.104
But it fits with what I remember
about you from high school.

46:48.156 --> 46:50.055
Which is what?

46:50.074 --> 46:53.225
Smart, focused, confident...

46:53.244 --> 46:54.694
Go on.

46:54.729 --> 46:58.915
And, as we used to say back
in the day, absolutely fly.

47:01.836 --> 47:03.619
Are you sure you didn't
sneak a little slurp

47:03.671 --> 47:06.122
of that wine on the side?

47:06.174 --> 47:08.541
Sober as a judge.

47:10.528 --> 47:12.295
You are crazy.

47:14.098 --> 47:15.348
Thank you.

47:18.753 --> 47:19.719
I had a great time.

47:19.754 --> 47:21.220
Me too.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.190
Well, this is me.

47:25.527 --> 47:27.059
How about we do
this again Friday?

47:27.094 --> 47:29.061
Wow, you don't waste
much time, do you?

47:29.096 --> 47:30.279
Not anymore.

47:30.315 --> 47:31.864
That's another thing
I learned from you.

47:31.900 --> 47:32.982
Really?

47:34.602 --> 47:36.986
I spent the summer after
12th grade kicking myself

47:37.038 --> 47:39.405
for never saying anything
to you when I had the chance.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.823
What did you want to say?

47:50.618 --> 47:51.968
<i> He kissed you?</i>

47:53.555 --> 47:54.837
So you do like him?

47:54.889 --> 47:57.473
He's got some
short-term potential.

47:57.508 --> 47:58.808
Why short term?

47:58.843 --> 48:01.594
Duh, I live in new york?

48:03.681 --> 48:05.297
Why aren't the girls
helping with this?

48:05.316 --> 48:08.351
Unfortunately that required
being in the same room as us.

48:08.403 --> 48:09.635
Right.

48:09.654 --> 48:11.604
Cat, there's a naked
spot right there.

48:33.261 --> 48:40.132
<i> [construction in background]</i>

48:41.502 --> 48:43.552
wow, you have made progress.

48:43.605 --> 48:44.937
Doing my best.

48:44.973 --> 48:46.472
I found a range
over in milford,

48:46.507 --> 48:48.941
but they need to
deliver next week.

48:48.977 --> 48:50.359
We can have the kitchen ready.

48:50.395 --> 48:51.360
Really?

48:51.396 --> 48:53.062
Count on it!

48:53.114 --> 48:54.730
Thanks.

48:57.902 --> 48:59.201
What are you doing?

48:59.237 --> 49:01.037
Taping drywall.

49:09.247 --> 49:12.698
Do you like it when people
look over your shoulder

49:12.717 --> 49:13.916
while you're cooking?

49:13.968 --> 49:17.219
Is that person being a nuisance,
or are they trying to learn?

49:17.255 --> 49:19.639
Fair enough.

49:19.674 --> 49:22.758
I put down about
an eighth of an inch

49:22.810 --> 49:24.644
to make sure there
are no dry spots.

49:24.679 --> 49:27.212
Dry spots give you bubbles.

49:27.231 --> 49:28.397
Don't want bubbles.

49:28.433 --> 49:30.516
No, ma'am.

49:30.551 --> 49:34.520
So, you still have
your antlers?

49:34.555 --> 49:36.605
What?

49:36.658 --> 49:38.941
You don't remember me,
do you?

49:38.993 --> 49:40.242
Should I?

49:40.278 --> 49:42.745
I used to come in here
when you waitressed.

49:42.780 --> 49:47.283
You'll have to imagine me
as an obnoxious 13 year old.

49:47.335 --> 49:50.169
Oh, now you look familiar.

49:50.204 --> 49:52.838
I would always try
and get your table.

49:52.874 --> 49:57.009
Well yeah, the other
waitress was 87.

49:57.045 --> 49:59.462
Every year for christmas,
oscar would dress up as santa,

49:59.514 --> 50:02.014
and you'd wear
reindeer antlers.

50:02.050 --> 50:03.182
Oh yeah.

50:03.217 --> 50:05.468
I don't know how you made
those things look sexy,

50:05.520 --> 50:08.054
but you did.

50:08.089 --> 50:12.058
Well, every 13 year old boy
thinks everything is sexy.

50:13.861 --> 50:17.429
I'm glad you're bringing
the place back to life.

50:17.448 --> 50:19.648
Of course if the oscar special
isn't still on the menu,

50:19.701 --> 50:20.983
I'm not coming.

50:21.035 --> 50:22.434
Duly noted.

50:22.453 --> 50:24.236
Now, the tape.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.572
I use paper instead
of fiberglass.

50:26.607 --> 50:29.158
Once you get the hang of it,
it's faster and cheaper.

50:29.210 --> 50:32.328
I'm all about fast and cheap.

50:32.380 --> 50:34.964
I doubt you mean that
the way it sounds.

50:36.667 --> 50:38.283
I'm only interested
in companies

50:38.302 --> 50:41.053
that want to do
well by doing good.

50:41.089 --> 50:42.588
Is the interview
with a partner?

50:42.623 --> 50:43.455
<i> [josh] I'll check.</i>

50:43.474 --> 50:44.289
Let me know.

50:44.308 --> 50:45.124
<i> Will do.</i>

50:45.143 --> 50:46.592
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

50:47.845 --> 50:48.978
Hey.

50:49.013 --> 50:49.812
Hey!

50:49.847 --> 50:50.646
You got a minute?

50:50.681 --> 50:51.480
Sure.

50:51.516 --> 50:53.632
So I was at my
attorney's office

50:53.651 --> 50:56.152
and I met another woman who's
in the middle of a divorce

50:56.187 --> 50:58.154
and she's desperate
for financial advice.

50:58.189 --> 51:00.439
Her husband handled everything
and she is admittedly clueless.

51:00.474 --> 51:03.242
She's willing to pay.

51:03.277 --> 51:04.777
It's you, right?

51:04.812 --> 51:07.363
Please, as if ethan
handled anything.

51:07.415 --> 51:08.581
Oh, good point.

51:08.616 --> 51:10.282
Ellen...

51:10.317 --> 51:12.451
This is riley nelson,
ellen singer.

51:12.486 --> 51:13.619
You're gonna be
in good hands.

51:13.654 --> 51:14.920
-Hi!
-Hi.

51:14.956 --> 51:16.288
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

51:16.323 --> 51:17.873
Have a seat.

51:17.925 --> 51:19.324
I brought a few
records with me.

51:19.343 --> 51:20.292
Okay.

51:25.183 --> 51:26.715
Oh, catherine.

51:26.768 --> 51:28.300
Peyton.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.886
I'm just checking to see that
the renovations are going okay?

51:30.938 --> 51:32.471
It's great, thank you.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.473
You've taken on
a risky project.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.609
Look peyton, I know you
wanted the building.

51:36.644 --> 51:39.612
I'm simply woried that you moved
here only to lose everything.

51:39.647 --> 51:41.346
Well not everything.

51:41.365 --> 51:43.983
Even if the restaurant fails,
we'll still have the building.

51:44.018 --> 51:47.570
That's not your deal.
Didn't riley tell you?

51:49.523 --> 51:51.190
You don't own the building?

51:51.209 --> 51:54.293
I don't have enough money.

51:54.328 --> 51:56.045
What about big
honking check?

51:56.080 --> 51:58.881
Not big enough to buy the
building, pay for renovations,

51:58.916 --> 52:02.001
and keep us afloat until
we generate some income.

52:02.036 --> 52:04.420
I negotiated a lease with
the option to buy later.

52:04.472 --> 52:05.504
Why didn't you tell me?

52:05.539 --> 52:08.841
Because it doesn't
change anything for you.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.227
It changes everything for you!

52:11.262 --> 52:12.344
What if we fail?

52:12.379 --> 52:13.896
What're you going
to fall back on?

52:13.931 --> 52:16.182
My considerable
wit and charm.

52:18.736 --> 52:20.653
I'm serious.

52:20.688 --> 52:23.522
Cat, I know what's at stake.

52:23.557 --> 52:25.357
All that I ask is
that if we go down,

52:25.392 --> 52:27.409
we go down swinging.

52:29.163 --> 52:30.696
It's gonna be fine.

52:40.591 --> 52:42.641
-Hi.
-Hi.

52:42.677 --> 52:44.410
Your timing is perfect.

52:44.445 --> 52:47.413
Between restaurant paperwork,
setting up a website,

52:47.448 --> 52:49.265
sending out resumes,

52:49.300 --> 52:51.283
teaching divorced
housewives how to invest--

52:51.319 --> 52:53.018
I'm exhausted just
listening to you.

52:53.054 --> 52:54.470
[chuckles]

52:54.505 --> 52:56.939
a ride in the country
sounds heavenly.

52:56.974 --> 53:00.259
Does your fuel-efficient
car have reliable heat?

53:00.294 --> 53:02.778
Oh, this isn't the ride.

53:02.813 --> 53:07.316
This is just the
ride to the ride.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.734
Okay...

53:49.360 --> 53:50.776
I should've known
you'd find something

53:50.828 --> 53:53.445
even more environmentally
friendly.

53:53.497 --> 53:55.397
Are you warm enough?

53:55.416 --> 53:57.833
Maybe I should
turn the heat up.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.123
It's beautiful.

54:04.175 --> 54:06.125
Such a beautiful day.

54:46.968 --> 54:48.283
Thanks a lot for coming in.

54:48.302 --> 54:49.218
You bet.

54:50.254 --> 54:52.554
-Hi.
-Hi.

54:52.590 --> 54:54.390
These came for you.

54:54.425 --> 54:55.758
You have to change
your address.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.059
Right.

54:58.145 --> 54:59.795
I don't know how your
baseball trophies ended up

54:59.814 --> 55:02.815
with the christmas
decorations, but...

55:02.850 --> 55:04.650
You made me take
them off the bookshelf

55:04.685 --> 55:05.901
when you put them
up last year

55:05.936 --> 55:08.520
and I just threw them in
the nearest box, I guess.

55:08.572 --> 55:11.490
I think this is what
you're looking for.

55:11.525 --> 55:14.276
The christmas
stockings are in here.

55:15.446 --> 55:16.328
Yeah it is.

55:16.364 --> 55:18.530
Oh wow...

55:18.582 --> 55:19.948
I wondered what
happened to him.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.283
Do you remember him?

55:21.318 --> 55:22.451
No.

55:24.422 --> 55:26.672
It was the first christmas
after we were married.

55:26.707 --> 55:28.841
We were living
paycheck to paycheck.

55:28.876 --> 55:31.210
I hadn't sold a
children's book yet.

55:31.262 --> 55:33.045
We hardly had any
christmas decorations

55:33.097 --> 55:35.664
and I saw him
and I fell in love.

55:35.683 --> 55:38.384
And I said we
couldn't afford him.

55:38.436 --> 55:40.552
Yeah, but then you
went back and bought him

55:40.604 --> 55:44.640
and there he was, under
the tree on christmas eve.

55:50.197 --> 55:52.180
What happened to us?

55:52.199 --> 55:53.399
Sarah...

55:53.451 --> 55:55.150
Help me understand.

55:55.185 --> 55:57.286
Did you ever love me?

55:57.321 --> 55:59.354
Of course I did.

55:59.373 --> 56:02.124
So what?

56:02.159 --> 56:04.960
This thing with britney,
it just happened.

56:04.995 --> 56:06.745
It just happened?

56:06.797 --> 56:08.297
I wasn't looking
for anything.

56:08.332 --> 56:09.715
I wasn't on the hunt.

56:09.750 --> 56:14.336
So what? You saw her
and you thought  oh well?

56:14.371 --> 56:15.487
You don't buy
the candy yourself,

56:15.523 --> 56:17.923
but then you see a bowl of m&ms
and you just take one?

56:17.975 --> 56:19.842
Okay look, this isn't
helping either of us.

56:19.877 --> 56:22.811
I'm sorry...
I am.

56:22.847 --> 56:25.180
But it's over and
you need to move on.

56:39.196 --> 56:40.279
I'm an idiot.

56:40.331 --> 56:41.747
No, you're not.

56:41.782 --> 56:44.016
You're big-hearted and always
see the best in people.

56:44.051 --> 56:45.617
Like I said, idiot.

56:45.669 --> 56:47.035
You know how a liar
always thinks

56:47.070 --> 56:48.120
that everybody else is lying?

56:48.172 --> 56:49.505
You're the opposite.

56:49.540 --> 56:51.957
Because you're decent,
you think that

56:52.009 --> 56:54.510
everyone else will be
as well and, they're not.

56:54.545 --> 56:56.678
Well, I need to
change so quick.

56:56.714 --> 56:59.264
Teach me to be
mean and deceitful.

56:59.300 --> 57:01.416
Don't ever lose
that goodness, sarah.

57:01.435 --> 57:03.969
That's why you write such
sweet children's books.

57:04.021 --> 57:08.140
Just see people
for who they are,

57:08.192 --> 57:10.592
not who you want them to be.

57:10.611 --> 57:12.811
Well, I know who
you guys are.

57:12.863 --> 57:15.397
You're my friends!
Come here!

57:21.005 --> 57:24.456
<i> [peyton] look how</i>
<i> spacious the kitchen is!</i>

57:24.492 --> 57:27.826
<i> [buyer] the cupboards and</i>
<i> the sink will have to go.</i>

57:27.878 --> 57:29.294
I like my kitchen!

57:29.330 --> 57:30.295
Me too.

57:30.331 --> 57:32.581
<i> And we will definitely</i>
<i> need new counter tops.</i>

57:32.616 --> 57:35.384
Whatever. The kitchen is
yours, babe. Have at it.

57:36.387 --> 57:37.219
Oh!

57:39.390 --> 57:40.672
Great place, really.

57:40.724 --> 57:43.559
Yeah, it's charming
in a woodsy kind of way.

57:43.594 --> 57:46.395
-Thanks.
-We'll give you some space.

57:49.299 --> 57:51.099
Just down the hall...

57:53.303 --> 57:56.137
Here, right in here...

57:56.157 --> 57:57.406
They hate my house.

57:57.441 --> 57:58.607
Good.

58:01.328 --> 58:03.812
<i> You know what would look</i>
<i> good above the fireplace?</i>

58:03.831 --> 58:06.314
<i> A 70-inch flatscreen.</i>

58:06.333 --> 58:08.000
<i> All that ugly stonework?</i>

58:08.035 --> 58:10.085
<i> We'd rip that out.</i>

58:10.120 --> 58:12.504
My grandfather built that!

58:12.540 --> 58:13.822
I know.

58:13.841 --> 58:16.375
<i> I wish there was</i>
<i> an exercise area.</i>

58:16.427 --> 58:17.926
What about in
the kid's room?

58:17.962 --> 58:19.928
You could put your treadmill
and weights up there.

58:19.964 --> 58:22.214
Add a tv and you can
make it your man cave.

58:22.266 --> 58:26.585
[laughing]

58:30.140 --> 58:31.440
can you pick up your crap?

58:31.475 --> 58:33.108
Hey! Don't touch my stuff.

58:33.143 --> 58:35.894
Put it away then,
it's getting filthy.

58:35.946 --> 58:38.030
My stuff, my problem.

58:38.065 --> 58:42.484
My room, my problem.
And you're on my bed!

58:42.519 --> 58:45.037
Why is this out?
It's mine.

58:45.072 --> 58:47.406
I just tried it on!
Jeez, what's your problem?

58:47.458 --> 58:48.457
Don't you get it?

58:48.492 --> 58:49.791
I'm gonna have
to leave my home!

58:49.827 --> 58:51.293
My parents are
getting divorced!

58:51.328 --> 58:52.494
My dad's gonna have a new kid

58:52.529 --> 58:54.546
and I'm barely
gonna see him anymore.

58:54.582 --> 58:56.915
So? I had to
leave my life

58:56.967 --> 58:59.084
and I'm never going
to see my dad again.

58:59.136 --> 59:00.219
Never!

59:01.255 --> 59:04.139
Girls! There are
people downstairs.

59:13.317 --> 59:14.816
So what do we think?

59:14.852 --> 59:16.768
Babe, I think it's
the best one we've seen

59:16.820 --> 59:18.237
and we're on a deadline.

59:18.272 --> 59:19.721
Okay, I can make it work.

59:19.740 --> 59:22.074
We do have one
more house to visit.

59:22.109 --> 59:23.909
Well then let's go!

59:25.029 --> 59:25.827
Thank you!

59:25.863 --> 59:27.246
You're welcome.

59:39.843 --> 59:41.176
They're gone.

59:45.049 --> 59:47.182
You want some hot chocolate?

59:47.217 --> 59:49.134
Do we have marshmallows?

59:49.186 --> 59:50.636
Indeed we do.

59:52.589 --> 59:57.059
I'm sorry it's been
so difficult with taylor.

59:58.261 --> 59:59.561
Mom?

59:59.596 --> 1:00:01.396
Yes?

1:00:01.431 --> 1:00:04.232
Am I the reason dad left?

1:00:07.571 --> 1:00:08.870
No, of course not.

1:00:08.906 --> 1:00:13.709
You sure he didn't just
get tired of being my dad?

1:00:13.744 --> 1:00:15.744
He adores you, honey.

1:00:15.779 --> 1:00:19.131
He didn't even ask about
putting up the tree this year.

1:00:20.801 --> 1:00:22.417
He feels guilty.

1:00:23.420 --> 1:00:26.088
And we haven't gone ice
skating together since...

1:00:27.758 --> 1:00:31.126
I think it's easier
for him to stay away

1:00:31.145 --> 1:00:33.312
than to face his feelings.

1:00:35.265 --> 1:00:37.649
Did you know taylor's dad?

1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:40.819
What was he like?

1:00:43.107 --> 1:00:47.776
He was fun and funny.

1:00:47.811 --> 1:00:51.430
And he loved cat
and doted on taylor.

1:00:51.465 --> 1:00:53.949
Taylor didn't
want to move here.

1:00:53.984 --> 1:00:55.100
I know.

1:00:55.135 --> 1:00:58.170
I don't want
to move, either.

1:00:58.205 --> 1:00:59.538
I know.

1:00:59.590 --> 1:01:01.289
I love this house.

1:01:03.744 --> 1:01:05.460
I do, too.

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:11.332
But you know what the best
thing about this house is?

1:01:11.352 --> 1:01:13.268
What?

1:01:13.303 --> 1:01:14.970
That you're here.

1:01:18.025 --> 1:01:21.860
A house is special because of
the people living inside it.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:28.183
And I love you so much,

1:01:28.202 --> 1:01:30.318
no matter where we end
up it will be home

1:01:30.353 --> 1:01:32.020
because you'll be there.

1:01:32.039 --> 1:01:33.572
I love you.

1:01:33.624 --> 1:01:34.873
I love you.

1:01:44.017 --> 1:01:45.100
Hey.

1:01:46.854 --> 1:01:48.987
I don't care
about hannah, or you,

1:01:49.022 --> 1:01:52.324
or my mother's restaurant,
or this stupid house.

1:01:52.359 --> 1:01:54.976
That's a lot to
not care about.

1:01:55.012 --> 1:01:56.778
I hate it here.

1:01:56.814 --> 1:01:59.715
I don't know why my
mother did this to me.

1:01:59.750 --> 1:02:02.334
She wants to give you
something she never had.

1:02:02.369 --> 1:02:04.119
A crappy life?

1:02:04.154 --> 1:02:05.871
You think this is bad?

1:02:05.923 --> 1:02:07.205
Yeah.

1:02:08.575 --> 1:02:10.876
Has your mother ever told you
about her life growing up?

1:02:10.928 --> 1:02:15.747
Some cousin took her
in when her parents died.

1:02:15.783 --> 1:02:17.883
And?

1:02:17.935 --> 1:02:20.769
And when she grew up,
she moved away.

1:02:20.804 --> 1:02:24.890
Okay well, let me
fill you in.

1:02:24.942 --> 1:02:28.059
Those cousins were her
only living relatives

1:02:28.112 --> 1:02:31.646
and they took her in, so I
give them points for that,

1:02:31.681 --> 1:02:33.982
but they were never family.

1:02:34.017 --> 1:02:36.985
They never celebrated
any birthdays,

1:02:37.020 --> 1:02:40.355
came to any school plays,
took her on trips,

1:02:40.374 --> 1:02:42.124
they never made
her feel wanted.

1:02:42.159 --> 1:02:45.994
No hugs, no kisses.
Could you imagine?

1:02:46.029 --> 1:02:50.332
She was nothing but an
inconvenience to them.

1:02:50.367 --> 1:02:52.300
She was miserable.

1:02:52.336 --> 1:02:56.388
I knew that the
first time I met her.

1:02:56.423 --> 1:02:59.007
Unhappy kids can
spot each other.

1:03:01.178 --> 1:03:02.928
Why were you miserable?

1:03:06.166 --> 1:03:08.567
Alcoholic parents who
couldn't hold down jobs

1:03:08.602 --> 1:03:10.435
and whose idea of family time

1:03:10.487 --> 1:03:12.404
was throwing things
at each other.

1:03:12.439 --> 1:03:14.523
I wanted to
punch out the world

1:03:14.558 --> 1:03:18.410
and cat was curled
in a fetal ball.

1:03:18.445 --> 1:03:20.779
And then sarah came along

1:03:20.814 --> 1:03:24.332
and somehow made
friends with both of us.

1:03:24.368 --> 1:03:26.618
And sarah's mom,

1:03:26.670 --> 1:03:29.904
who in my books should
be put up for sainthood,

1:03:29.923 --> 1:03:33.041
made us feel at home here.

1:03:33.076 --> 1:03:39.747
We celebrated every birthday,
every holiday, and christmas.

1:03:39.766 --> 1:03:43.685
Cat and I never really had a
christmas until we came here.

1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:47.755
So, yeah, this place
is special for us.

1:03:47.774 --> 1:03:50.058
This house is our safe place.

1:03:50.093 --> 1:03:52.727
And I think your
mom came here

1:03:52.762 --> 1:03:56.615
hoping you could have
a safe place, too.

1:03:58.202 --> 1:03:59.551
Do you understand?

1:04:13.717 --> 1:04:14.583
Hey.

1:04:16.453 --> 1:04:18.053
Hey, yourself.

1:04:18.088 --> 1:04:20.338
I saw the light and
wondered who was here.

1:04:20.390 --> 1:04:24.142
Just me trying to get done
on time, under budget.

1:04:24.177 --> 1:04:27.429
What are you doing wandering
the streets on a cold night?

1:04:27.464 --> 1:04:31.099
Feeling anxious, I just
started driving.

1:04:31.134 --> 1:04:32.767
Anxious about?

1:04:32.802 --> 1:04:35.086
The restaurant opening.

1:04:35.122 --> 1:04:37.739
You can cook, right?

1:04:37.774 --> 1:04:38.857
Yes.

1:04:38.909 --> 1:04:41.243
Then people will come.

1:04:41.278 --> 1:04:43.078
I can't wait for
word of mouth.

1:04:43.113 --> 1:04:44.779
We need to make a splash.

1:04:44.814 --> 1:04:46.948
We're opening next week
right before christmas.

1:04:46.983 --> 1:04:50.201
Everybody's already so busy.

1:04:50.254 --> 1:04:52.587
So make it a christmas party.

1:04:52.623 --> 1:04:54.789
It's your gift to the town.
It's all shiny and new.

1:04:54.824 --> 1:04:57.425
Yeah! Dot's cafe was a great
old restaurant,

1:04:57.461 --> 1:04:59.811
cat's cafe will be a
great new restaurant.

1:04:59.846 --> 1:05:01.630
That's the spirit.

1:05:03.216 --> 1:05:07.018
Spirit... That's it!

1:05:07.054 --> 1:05:08.303
What's it?

1:05:08.338 --> 1:05:11.189
Christmas past
and christmas future.

1:05:11.224 --> 1:05:12.641
All right.

1:05:19.816 --> 1:05:21.700
Oh! It snowed while
we were eating.

1:05:21.735 --> 1:05:23.985
Nothing compares to leaving
footprints in fresh snow.

1:05:24.020 --> 1:05:25.904
It says, "I was here."

1:05:25.956 --> 1:05:28.206
but then it melts and gets
slushy and ruins your shoes.

1:05:28.241 --> 1:05:31.543
So, glass half empty.
Good to know.

1:05:31.578 --> 1:05:32.877
When does cat's place open?

1:05:32.913 --> 1:05:34.296
Soon, thank goodness.

1:05:34.331 --> 1:05:36.531
Worried about your investment?

1:05:36.550 --> 1:05:39.367
And my life, it's time for
me to get back to new york.

1:05:39.386 --> 1:05:40.552
What's your hurry?

1:05:40.587 --> 1:05:44.872
I've got some headhunters
dangling opportunities for me.

1:05:44.891 --> 1:05:46.874
Our hospital could
use a fundraiser.

1:05:46.893 --> 1:05:48.042
How much does it pay?

1:05:48.061 --> 1:05:49.144
Six figures.

1:05:49.179 --> 1:05:50.095
Really?

1:05:50.147 --> 1:05:52.380
The last two come after
the decimal point.

1:05:52.399 --> 1:05:54.432
Oh, so I would have
to live in my car?

1:05:54.484 --> 1:05:56.217
You'd save on furnishings.

1:05:56.236 --> 1:05:57.736
[laughing]

1:05:57.771 --> 1:05:59.904
I'll hate to see you go.

1:05:59.940 --> 1:06:01.222
It's not like
I won't be back.

1:06:01.241 --> 1:06:03.274
You'll have a new job,
be busy.

1:06:03.327 --> 1:06:04.726
We can do facetime.

1:06:04.745 --> 1:06:07.996
Facetime isn't face time.

1:06:08.031 --> 1:06:11.082
You have done fine
without me all this time.

1:06:11.118 --> 1:06:12.917
I'm not worried about you.

1:06:12.953 --> 1:06:14.536
I am.

1:06:14.571 --> 1:06:15.670
Jake.

1:06:15.706 --> 1:06:17.088
You have energy.

1:06:17.124 --> 1:06:18.456
I love how you make
things happen.

1:06:18.508 --> 1:06:22.093
New york doesn't
need you, we do.

1:06:22.129 --> 1:06:23.211
I do.

1:06:28.552 --> 1:06:30.185
Jake, I'm sorry.

1:06:30.220 --> 1:06:32.854
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

1:06:32.889 --> 1:06:35.357
I'm really sorry.

1:06:35.392 --> 1:06:36.891
Why not?

1:06:39.730 --> 1:06:45.233
We live hundreds of miles apart
in every possible way.

1:06:57.130 --> 1:06:59.047
Everyone will be decked
out for christmas,

1:06:59.082 --> 1:07:02.133
and on the menus one side
will be christmas past

1:07:02.169 --> 1:07:04.285
with a few of the old
favorites oscar used to offer.

1:07:04.304 --> 1:07:06.304
And on the other,
christmas future:

1:07:06.339 --> 1:07:07.806
Everything I'll be preparing.

1:07:07.841 --> 1:07:12.177
It's a celebration of what's
been and what's yet to come.

1:07:12.229 --> 1:07:15.647
Great, let's get
started on the design.

1:07:15.682 --> 1:07:17.432
<i> [riley] hello?</i>

1:07:17.467 --> 1:07:19.734
We're in here.

1:07:19.770 --> 1:07:22.237
Hey, how was your date?

1:07:22.272 --> 1:07:25.523
Umm... I think
it's time to move on.

1:07:26.777 --> 1:07:28.243
Why, what's wrong with jake?

1:07:28.278 --> 1:07:29.360
I'm just not interested.

1:07:29.413 --> 1:07:31.112
You're not attracted to him?

1:07:31.147 --> 1:07:33.364
I didn't say that.

1:07:33.417 --> 1:07:35.033
What, he's no fun?

1:07:35.068 --> 1:07:36.284
He's very fun.

1:07:36.319 --> 1:07:37.702
Too needy?

1:07:37.754 --> 1:07:39.788
He's annoyingly well-adjusted.

1:07:39.823 --> 1:07:42.006
Sarah, I think it's time
we stage an intervention.

1:07:42.042 --> 1:07:43.174
A what?

1:07:43.210 --> 1:07:46.010
Riley, you find something wrong
with every guy you date.

1:07:46.046 --> 1:07:50.832
I offer evidence: Rick,
vincent, ryan, jimmy.

1:07:50.851 --> 1:07:53.268
That's just from easter.

1:07:53.303 --> 1:07:55.770
Loser, loser,
sociopath, loser.

1:07:55.806 --> 1:07:57.105
Really, everyone?

1:07:57.140 --> 1:08:00.391
Are you sure you haven't let
a few good guys slip past you?

1:08:00.444 --> 1:08:02.777
Better to be single than
in a bad relationship.

1:08:02.813 --> 1:08:04.178
You know what they do.

1:08:04.197 --> 1:08:06.281
Riley, not every relationship

1:08:06.316 --> 1:08:09.451
is gonna end up
like your parents.

1:08:09.486 --> 1:08:11.603
Says the woman who's in
the middle of a divorce.

1:08:11.638 --> 1:08:14.405
Not fair, sarah and ethan
were good for each other

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:17.292
when they were young.
She grew up, he didn't.

1:08:17.327 --> 1:08:20.578
I hate how that turned
out, I hate it,

1:08:20.630 --> 1:08:24.582
but I have good memories and
I have a beautiful daughter.

1:08:24.634 --> 1:08:27.469
We're not saying
jake is the guy,

1:08:27.504 --> 1:08:30.221
but instead of thinking about
everything that's wrong,

1:08:30.257 --> 1:08:34.809
maybe you should start
thinking about what's right.

1:08:34.845 --> 1:08:37.228
I just don't want
to make a mistake.

1:08:37.264 --> 1:08:39.731
Just don't let that
mistake be trying so hard

1:08:39.766 --> 1:08:41.516
not to be your parents
that you pass up

1:08:41.551 --> 1:08:43.201
a real chance at happiness.

1:09:05.759 --> 1:09:06.574
Santa.

1:09:06.593 --> 1:09:08.176
Chef.

1:09:08.211 --> 1:09:09.093
Ready to open?

1:09:09.129 --> 1:09:10.428
Gotta be.

1:09:10.463 --> 1:09:13.414
Have fun, keep an eye on each
other, and cover where needed.

1:09:13.433 --> 1:09:16.100
If things jam up, I can always
pour some coffee and water.

1:09:18.021 --> 1:09:19.687
Showtime.

1:09:19.723 --> 1:09:20.688
Break a ladle.

1:09:20.724 --> 1:09:22.924
Back at you.
Where is sarah?

1:09:22.943 --> 1:09:25.276
She has to take care
of something first.

1:09:31.401 --> 1:09:33.318
Welcome to cat's cafe.

1:09:52.839 --> 1:09:55.640
What's so important you
had to tell me in person?

1:09:55.675 --> 1:09:58.142
Our daughter.

1:09:58.178 --> 1:09:59.928
What happened?

1:09:59.963 --> 1:10:02.764
Hannah thinks that she's
the reason why you left.

1:10:02.799 --> 1:10:05.132
Ah, that's crazy.

1:10:05.151 --> 1:10:08.102
It's how she feels.

1:10:08.137 --> 1:10:09.437
I'll talk to her.

1:10:09.472 --> 1:10:11.472
You have to do more
than just talk, ethan.

1:10:11.491 --> 1:10:13.140
You can't take the easy
way out this time.

1:10:13.159 --> 1:10:14.859
This time?

1:10:14.911 --> 1:10:18.646
Looking back, you've always
taken the easy way out.

1:10:18.665 --> 1:10:20.114
It's probably
why we got married.

1:10:20.149 --> 1:10:21.249
Oh, come on--

1:10:21.284 --> 1:10:22.817
I'm not saying
you didn't love me.

1:10:22.836 --> 1:10:24.452
We were together
a long time,

1:10:24.487 --> 1:10:27.589
getting married was just
the path of least resistance.

1:10:27.624 --> 1:10:29.824
You're wrong.

1:10:29.843 --> 1:10:31.259
All through college,
all you talked about

1:10:31.294 --> 1:10:33.544
was travelling the world
and living somewhere else.

1:10:33.597 --> 1:10:34.963
I sent out resumes.

1:10:34.998 --> 1:10:36.631
You sent out a few.

1:10:36.666 --> 1:10:38.516
I mean just face it, ethan,

1:10:38.551 --> 1:10:41.669
it was easier to work
at your dad's store.

1:10:41.688 --> 1:10:42.670
Just like this affair,

1:10:42.689 --> 1:10:44.005
you say you weren't
even looking for it--

1:10:44.024 --> 1:10:45.106
I wasn't, it just happened!

1:10:45.141 --> 1:10:47.675
Because you let it happen.

1:10:47.694 --> 1:10:49.677
You could've said no,
it was too easy though.

1:10:49.696 --> 1:10:51.512
Are you going to be like
this every time we meet?

1:10:51.531 --> 1:10:52.647
No, I'm not.

1:10:52.682 --> 1:10:56.367
The past is the past and you
can own up to it or not.

1:10:56.403 --> 1:10:57.435
But moving forward--

1:10:57.470 --> 1:10:59.320
what?

1:10:59.355 --> 1:11:03.458
Our daughter needs to
know by word and deed

1:11:03.493 --> 1:11:04.709
that her dad loves her.

1:11:04.744 --> 1:11:06.244
Of course I love her.

1:11:06.296 --> 1:11:08.379
Well, you've dropped
the ball lately.

1:11:08.415 --> 1:11:11.633
She's feeling neglected.

1:11:11.668 --> 1:11:12.667
Okay?

1:11:14.838 --> 1:11:17.672
Look ethan, you know what,
piece of advice.

1:11:20.010 --> 1:11:22.543
Since you're gonna
have another child.

1:11:22.562 --> 1:11:26.147
Next time your baby wakes up
in the middle of the night,

1:11:26.182 --> 1:11:28.349
don't roll over and have
your wife go handle it,

1:11:28.384 --> 1:11:31.519
handle it yourself.

1:11:31.554 --> 1:11:32.987
Just saying.

1:11:47.754 --> 1:11:49.587
Can I offer you
ladies a refill?

1:11:49.622 --> 1:11:51.005
No thanks.

1:11:51.041 --> 1:11:52.590
We love the new menu.

1:11:52.625 --> 1:11:56.861
The ahi tuna with
cranberry salsa was amazing.

1:11:56.896 --> 1:12:00.848
And look at dessert:
An ice cream snowman.

1:12:00.884 --> 1:12:02.600
It's almost too cute to eat.

1:12:02.635 --> 1:12:04.602
Almost! Be sure to
tell all your friends.

1:12:04.637 --> 1:12:06.187
I will, just like I've told

1:12:06.222 --> 1:12:08.056
jean and barbara
here about you.

1:12:08.091 --> 1:12:11.476
Now they both want to see
you about their investments.

1:12:11.528 --> 1:12:13.978
Ellen has my number,
so give me a call.

1:12:14.030 --> 1:12:15.563
Thank you.

1:12:18.201 --> 1:12:20.151
Thought I would
bring these myself.

1:12:20.203 --> 1:12:21.652
Two oscar specials.

1:12:21.705 --> 1:12:22.704
Nice touch.

1:12:22.739 --> 1:12:24.105
All those fancy dishes.

1:12:24.124 --> 1:12:26.440
You sure these are real
genuine oscar specials?

1:12:26.459 --> 1:12:27.942
Had to leave it on the menu.

1:12:27.961 --> 1:12:29.827
Somebody made me promise.

1:12:29.879 --> 1:12:31.996
You didn't sneak anything
healthy in here, did you?

1:12:32.048 --> 1:12:33.715
I knew he'd embarrass me.

1:12:33.750 --> 1:12:36.918
I'm betting he was one of your
obnoxious buddies growing up?

1:12:36.953 --> 1:12:38.469
Still is, apparently.

1:12:39.756 --> 1:12:41.055
Well?

1:12:41.091 --> 1:12:42.924
It's even better
than I remember.

1:12:42.959 --> 1:12:44.559
Probably because it is better.

1:12:44.594 --> 1:12:46.293
You were right
about her, rocky.

1:12:46.312 --> 1:12:47.678
Right about what?

1:12:47.731 --> 1:12:50.481
Well you know, way back when he
always had to sit at your table

1:12:50.517 --> 1:12:52.800
because he was
crushing on you.

1:12:52.819 --> 1:12:54.318
He says you're
even nicer now.

1:12:54.354 --> 1:12:56.104
And you're even dumber!

1:12:56.139 --> 1:13:00.942
Jury's still out on you,
but I think he's nice, too.

1:13:11.254 --> 1:13:12.036
Wow.

1:13:12.088 --> 1:13:14.088
Right?

1:13:14.124 --> 1:13:16.457
Awesome arugula flatbread.

1:13:16.492 --> 1:13:18.960
It looks just like
a christmas tree.

1:13:18.995 --> 1:13:20.044
And those gingerbread cookies,

1:13:20.096 --> 1:13:21.429
I don't know what
she puts in them!

1:13:21.464 --> 1:13:23.264
She's a top chef from la.

1:13:23.299 --> 1:13:25.933
Kirkwood falls has
so much to offer!

1:13:28.004 --> 1:13:29.887
Oh.

1:13:29.939 --> 1:13:32.557
Didn't expect
to see you here.

1:13:32.609 --> 1:13:35.509
You haven't returned my
calls, what could I do?

1:13:35.528 --> 1:13:38.146
I've been busy.

1:13:38.181 --> 1:13:40.982
Look, I just thought as long
as you're still in town,

1:13:41.017 --> 1:13:41.949
maybe we could--

1:13:41.985 --> 1:13:45.236
really, really busy.

1:13:45.288 --> 1:13:47.688
Have I done something wrong?

1:13:47.707 --> 1:13:49.523
Jake, no.

1:13:49.542 --> 1:13:54.328
I think you're great.
Really, really great.

1:13:54.363 --> 1:13:56.130
It's me.

1:13:57.300 --> 1:14:00.251
Please, not the "it's not
you, it's me" speech.

1:14:00.303 --> 1:14:02.336
The debate team captain
can do better than that.

1:14:02.371 --> 1:14:05.590
Seriously, I have a problem.

1:14:05.642 --> 1:14:08.009
I can't help finding
fault with anyone I date.

1:14:08.044 --> 1:14:10.478
Really. Even me?

1:14:12.599 --> 1:14:14.899
Okay, so what are my faults?

1:14:14.934 --> 1:14:16.684
Well...

1:14:16.719 --> 1:14:19.103
Go ahead, just for fun.

1:14:19.155 --> 1:14:22.023
Okay. You're pushy,
like now.

1:14:22.058 --> 1:14:24.192
Wall streeters admire pushy.

1:14:24.227 --> 1:14:26.444
It's out of place
in kirkwood falls.

1:14:26.496 --> 1:14:29.697
Fair enough. Next.

1:14:29.732 --> 1:14:31.833
You're a late bloomer.

1:14:31.868 --> 1:14:33.367
You grew five
inches in college.

1:14:33.402 --> 1:14:35.036
I think your genes
are on hyperdrive

1:14:35.071 --> 1:14:37.338
so you're probably
gonna age prematurely.

1:14:37.373 --> 1:14:39.707
That's reaching, be real.

1:14:43.263 --> 1:14:45.680
You have a savior complex.

1:14:45.715 --> 1:14:47.298
Excuse me?

1:14:47.350 --> 1:14:49.800
Help this, volunteer that,
end evil.

1:14:49.853 --> 1:14:53.554
And all for free!
It's wearing.

1:14:53.589 --> 1:14:56.524
You're upset because I'm not
out to make a zillion bucks?

1:14:56.559 --> 1:14:59.360
Yes! I don't consider it a
virtue not to care about money.

1:14:59.395 --> 1:15:01.612
It's irresponsible.

1:15:01.648 --> 1:15:06.317
Okay. Pushy, a do-gooder,
apparently too tall,

1:15:06.352 --> 1:15:10.154
and insufficiently
enamored with money.

1:15:10.206 --> 1:15:13.708
But I have one big plus.

1:15:13.743 --> 1:15:15.626
What's that?

1:15:15.662 --> 1:15:18.162
I think you're terrific.

1:15:18.214 --> 1:15:21.966
I'm not! I'm overbearing,
obsessed with winning, bossy--

1:15:22.001 --> 1:15:23.551
that's all kind
of one and the same.

1:15:23.586 --> 1:15:29.140
Impatient, controlling,
outspoken, and sometimes snippy.

1:15:29.175 --> 1:15:30.758
A little bit.

1:15:30.793 --> 1:15:33.427
Are you done?
Because you missed one.

1:15:33.462 --> 1:15:34.461
What's that?

1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:36.430
It doesn't matter
because you don't scare me.

1:15:36.465 --> 1:15:37.965
Nobody's perfect.

1:15:37.984 --> 1:15:40.768
Were you listening
to anything I said?

1:15:40.803 --> 1:15:46.357
Yes, and you have
convinced me of one thing.

1:15:46.409 --> 1:15:48.859
Maybe if you were a
little easier on yourself,

1:15:48.912 --> 1:15:50.945
you could be easier
on others, too.

1:15:55.952 --> 1:15:59.537
I need to get to the hospital
to do good and stuff.

1:16:08.431 --> 1:16:12.934
So, he's handsome, fun,
smart, well-adjusted,

1:16:12.969 --> 1:16:15.019
knows you better than
you know yourself,

1:16:15.054 --> 1:16:17.521
and you're afraid
of making a mistake?

1:16:17.557 --> 1:16:19.307
I rest my case.

1:16:28.067 --> 1:16:30.151
I can never get
the corners right.

1:16:30.186 --> 1:16:31.452
Here. Press in at the side

1:16:31.487 --> 1:16:33.321
instead of taking
it from the top.

1:16:39.329 --> 1:16:40.828
I'll use gift bags.

1:16:42.248 --> 1:16:44.832
<i> [door knocking]</i>

1:16:57.146 --> 1:16:57.979
dad.

1:16:58.014 --> 1:16:59.230
Hi, honey.

1:16:59.265 --> 1:17:00.564
Mom's not here.

1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:02.733
I know, I just talked
to her on the phone.

1:17:02.769 --> 1:17:04.235
I thought you might
like to go skating.

1:17:04.270 --> 1:17:05.219
Really?

1:17:05.238 --> 1:17:08.572
Yeah, mom signed off.
Go grab your skates.

1:17:09.359 --> 1:17:10.557
Umm...

1:17:10.576 --> 1:17:12.243
What?

1:17:12.278 --> 1:17:14.745
Would it be okay if
taylor came with us?

1:17:14.781 --> 1:17:15.997
If she wants.

1:17:16.032 --> 1:17:17.198
Want to?

1:17:17.233 --> 1:17:20.985
No it's okay, you should
spend time with your dad.

1:17:21.020 --> 1:17:25.589
I will be spending
time with him and you.

1:17:25.625 --> 1:17:27.174
I don't have skates.

1:17:27.210 --> 1:17:28.342
We can rent some.

1:17:28.378 --> 1:17:29.794
Ever been ice skating?

1:17:29.846 --> 1:17:31.128
No.

1:17:31.180 --> 1:17:33.297
We'll teach you.
Come on!

1:17:41.557 --> 1:17:42.940
If dinner goes as
well as lunch,

1:17:42.975 --> 1:17:45.142
we're gonna have to
consider franchises.

1:17:45.194 --> 1:17:47.728
One good afternoon does not
a successful restaurant make.

1:17:47.763 --> 1:17:49.480
It was such a big crowd.

1:17:49.532 --> 1:17:51.649
And they loved the food.

1:17:51.701 --> 1:17:53.767
I guess I'm a
little optimistic.

1:17:53.786 --> 1:17:55.069
Where are you going?

1:17:55.104 --> 1:17:57.121
I got a house call to make.

1:18:15.341 --> 1:18:16.841
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:18:16.893 --> 1:18:19.226
It's cold out,
what're you doing?

1:18:19.262 --> 1:18:22.396
Waiting for you.

1:18:22.432 --> 1:18:24.682
What's up?

1:18:24.734 --> 1:18:25.933
I just had to know.

1:18:25.968 --> 1:18:29.070
What did I leave out?
What fault?

1:18:29.105 --> 1:18:31.856
You mean besides your
glaring commitment issues?

1:18:31.908 --> 1:18:34.442
Okay, besides that.

1:18:35.644 --> 1:18:37.661
You're germaphobic.

1:18:37.697 --> 1:18:39.196
No I'm not.

1:18:39.248 --> 1:18:40.698
Come on.

1:18:40.750 --> 1:18:43.534
You back out of doors instead
of using the exit bar.

1:18:43.586 --> 1:18:45.786
You flip light switches
with your elbows.

1:18:45.821 --> 1:18:47.455
You probably own
stock in purell.

1:18:55.131 --> 1:18:59.350
Would I do that if I
was afraid of germs?

1:18:59.385 --> 1:19:03.053
You really do insist on winning
every argument, don't you?

1:19:03.106 --> 1:19:05.356
Maybe just a little.

1:19:14.333 --> 1:19:16.767
<i> [front door opens]</i>

1:19:18.855 --> 1:19:20.888
<i> sarah, you should</i>
<i> have been there!</i>

1:19:20.907 --> 1:19:22.273
<i> Dinner was even</i>
<i> busier than lunch.</i>

1:19:22.325 --> 1:19:24.224
<i> We nearly ran</i>
<i> out of food!</i>

1:19:24.243 --> 1:19:26.994
That's great.

1:19:27.029 --> 1:19:28.662
What's the matter?

1:19:31.167 --> 1:19:32.166
Peyton called.

1:19:32.201 --> 1:19:34.502
The couple that wants
to gut the kitchen

1:19:34.537 --> 1:19:36.287
and tear down
the fireplace,

1:19:36.339 --> 1:19:41.292
basically erase my history from
this house, put in an offer.

1:19:41.327 --> 1:19:43.160
Full asking price.

1:19:43.196 --> 1:19:46.096
Oh, sarah...

1:19:46.132 --> 1:19:48.666
I had to sign it.

1:19:48.701 --> 1:19:51.519
I just don't have it in
me to take it to ethan's.

1:19:51.554 --> 1:19:53.270
I'll take it to him for you.

1:19:53.306 --> 1:19:54.555
Thanks.

1:19:56.091 --> 1:19:57.808
I'm gonna turn in.

1:19:59.395 --> 1:20:04.231
I'll get everything
ready for the weekend.

1:20:04.266 --> 1:20:07.768
Christmas... I wish
we could just skip it.

1:20:07.787 --> 1:20:08.953
Good night.

1:20:15.044 --> 1:20:19.663
I never thought I would
hear sarah say that.

1:20:19.699 --> 1:20:23.534
I wonder if santa has room in
his bag for a whole house.

1:20:39.318 --> 1:20:46.857
<i> ♪ instrumental</i>
<i> "joy to the world" ♪</i>

1:20:48.644 --> 1:20:50.477
merry christmas!

1:20:50.496 --> 1:20:52.446
Merry christmas.
What time is it?

1:20:52.481 --> 1:20:54.782
Time for presents!

1:20:54.817 --> 1:20:58.118
Let's start with stockings.
You first, mom.

1:20:58.153 --> 1:20:59.370
It's from all of us.

1:20:59.422 --> 1:21:00.254
All of you?

1:21:00.289 --> 1:21:01.088
That's right.

1:21:01.123 --> 1:21:02.623
We all pitched in.

1:21:08.431 --> 1:21:09.797
I don't get it.

1:21:09.832 --> 1:21:12.332
It's the sales contract
from the house.

1:21:12.351 --> 1:21:15.085
Ethan tore it up.

1:21:15.121 --> 1:21:16.270
What?

1:21:16.305 --> 1:21:18.005
I got to thinking.

1:21:18.024 --> 1:21:22.276
If cat and taylor and I continue
to live here but pay you rent,

1:21:22.311 --> 1:21:23.811
you'll be able to
cover your mortgage

1:21:23.846 --> 1:21:27.180
and pay ethan out over time.

1:21:27.199 --> 1:21:29.400
But you're going
back to new york.

1:21:29.452 --> 1:21:32.903
Thing is, I like it here.

1:21:32.955 --> 1:21:35.739
And I'll be able to keep
an eye on my investment,

1:21:35.791 --> 1:21:38.075
plus there's a line up
of women who want me

1:21:38.127 --> 1:21:40.193
to advise them on
their finances.

1:21:40.212 --> 1:21:42.913
So I'm gonna get by.

1:21:42.965 --> 1:21:45.549
Getting by doesn't
sound like riley nelson.

1:21:45.585 --> 1:21:47.384
Warren buffet lives in omaha.

1:21:47.420 --> 1:21:50.504
This town is about a
quarter the size of ohama.

1:21:50.539 --> 1:21:53.507
Well I'd take a quarter
size of his money.

1:21:55.061 --> 1:21:59.647
I've come to realize that this
place has a lot to offer.

1:21:59.682 --> 1:22:03.350
Including a certain insufferably
big-hearted doctor?

1:22:03.385 --> 1:22:06.070
We all have our faults.

1:22:06.105 --> 1:22:08.522
They asked us first and
we're totally on board,

1:22:08.557 --> 1:22:10.658
even though taylor and
I have to keep sharing.

1:22:10.693 --> 1:22:11.942
I like it.

1:22:11.994 --> 1:22:14.979
How could I annoy her if
I was in a different room?

1:22:17.366 --> 1:22:19.667
Ethan, he agreed to all this?

1:22:19.702 --> 1:22:22.369
He said to tell you
that signing the contract

1:22:22.404 --> 1:22:25.039
would have been easier,
but he's learned that

1:22:25.074 --> 1:22:28.175
just because something is
easy doesn't make it right.

1:22:31.547 --> 1:22:35.215
I can't believe you
guys did this for me.

1:22:35.250 --> 1:22:38.302
We did it for all of us.

1:22:38.354 --> 1:22:42.222
This house has always
felt like our home, too.

1:22:44.443 --> 1:22:45.943
That's because it is.

1:23:27.737 --> 1:23:29.853
Mom, the tree looks fine.

1:23:29.905 --> 1:23:32.573
There was a naked spot.

1:23:32.608 --> 1:23:34.024
Ho, ho, ho.

1:23:34.076 --> 1:23:35.909
Hot apple cider, anyone?

1:23:35.945 --> 1:23:37.077
Thank you!

1:23:37.113 --> 1:23:40.647
Merry, merry! Hi!

1:23:40.666 --> 1:23:44.702
Whoa, what did you do?
Rob a ups driver?

1:23:44.754 --> 1:23:47.654
It's christmas, I'm allowed
to get carried away.

1:23:47.673 --> 1:23:49.823
Mom, can we go skating later?

1:23:49.842 --> 1:23:52.325
I thought we could
take a sleigh ride.

1:23:52.344 --> 1:23:53.827
Let's do both.

1:23:53.846 --> 1:23:55.129
Sarah, come to
the rink with us?

1:23:55.164 --> 1:23:57.131
Oh, I don't know.

1:23:57.166 --> 1:23:59.600
Come on, you might
meet somebody nice.

1:23:59.635 --> 1:24:00.801
Yeah, mom.

1:24:00.836 --> 1:24:03.387
It's not like that guy is
gonna just knock at our door.

1:24:03.439 --> 1:24:06.223
<i> [door knocking]</i>

1:24:06.275 --> 1:24:08.809
maybe that's santa.

1:24:19.822 --> 1:24:22.956
Is this the house
on holly lane?

1:24:22.992 --> 1:24:25.325
Really, truly?

1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:27.211
Annie jane, I
told you to wait.

1:24:27.246 --> 1:24:28.829
I'm sorry, this
is embarrassing.

1:24:28.864 --> 1:24:31.248
We were out walking and
my daughter couldn't believe

1:24:31.300 --> 1:24:33.333
that there was a road
named holly lane.

1:24:33.368 --> 1:24:34.918
For the last month I
have been reading her

1:24:34.970 --> 1:24:37.504
the same book every
night over and over.

1:24:37.539 --> 1:24:40.007
The house on holly lane!

1:24:40.042 --> 1:24:41.341
The cover has a
drawing of a house

1:24:41.376 --> 1:24:42.843
that looks just like yours.

1:24:42.878 --> 1:24:45.679
You want to see
the fireplace?

1:24:45.714 --> 1:24:47.347
It's right through here,
sweetie.

1:24:47.382 --> 1:24:48.849
Come on in.

1:24:51.053 --> 1:24:54.104
I'm sarah michaels,
author and illustrator.

1:24:54.156 --> 1:24:57.157
Martin johannson,
father of your biggest fan.

1:24:57.193 --> 1:24:59.076
Martin, are you
new in town?

1:24:59.111 --> 1:25:02.496
We moved in Friday,
next road over.

1:25:02.531 --> 1:25:04.031
Just the two of you?

1:25:04.066 --> 1:25:07.201
Yes, single dad working
on teaching his daughter

1:25:07.236 --> 1:25:09.036
some impulse control.

1:25:10.172 --> 1:25:13.373
How about a cup
of hot cider?

1:25:13.408 --> 1:25:14.958
We couldn't impose.

1:25:15.010 --> 1:25:16.627
Yeah actually,
we have a thing?

1:25:16.679 --> 1:25:19.546
Oh yeah, the thing.
You know it's cancelled?

1:25:19.581 --> 1:25:21.014
Yeah, forget about the thing.

1:25:21.050 --> 1:25:24.051
Besides it's not
imposing, it's sharing.

1:25:24.086 --> 1:25:25.435
And what a sweet
christmas memory

1:25:25.471 --> 1:25:28.639
it would be
for your daughter.

1:25:28.674 --> 1:25:30.390
Well there's always room

1:25:30.425 --> 1:25:32.392
for more happy
memories in this house.

1:25:32.427 --> 1:25:34.228
Come on in.

1:25:42.437 --> 1:25:45.072
Dad, it is the house!

1:25:45.107 --> 1:25:48.575
Those are the magic stockings.

1:25:48.610 --> 1:25:51.328
You know, I think
they are magic.

1:25:51.380 --> 1:25:53.547
Me too.

1:25:53.582 --> 1:25:55.082
Me three.
