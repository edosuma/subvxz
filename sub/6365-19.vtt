WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.668
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.069
I wanted a different life,

00:04.071 --> 00:05.537
Things you could
never give me.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.239
Then there is no reason
for me to be here.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.374
I have a feeling
I've just begun to learn

00:08.376 --> 00:09.541
The extent of your skills.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.542
General renaude.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.412
General... Is it?

00:13.414 --> 00:16.315
Catherine, I care about you.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.351
2,000 french soldiers
to scotland

00:19.353 --> 00:21.587
Means fewer soldiers
facing England,

00:21.589 --> 00:23.322
Less on our borders
with navarre,

00:23.324 --> 00:24.723
The italian
and german territories.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.625
And those are just
our foreign threats.

00:26.627 --> 00:30.129
How can I betray my husband's
wishes, endanger his country?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.131
I have ordered
2,000 french troops

00:32.133 --> 00:34.433
To sail to scotland.
France can withstand

00:34.435 --> 00:36.035
<i>A temporary absence of troops.</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:39.405
I can't leave now, louis.
What do you see now?

00:39.407 --> 00:41.540
An affair under your husband's
roof and nothing more?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.042
That's all I can offer you.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.581
(boys' choir singing in latin)

00:55.055 --> 00:57.656
(singing in latin)

00:57.658 --> 01:00.726
(men shouting)

01:00.728 --> 01:02.194
(yelling and grunting)

01:12.772 --> 01:15.441
(singing continues)

01:18.745 --> 01:21.113
(priest gasping)

01:23.783 --> 01:26.285
(cawing)

01:30.223 --> 01:33.292
(wind whistling)

01:38.198 --> 01:40.632
Louis, you're back.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.103
I was starting to worry
you'd given up on us.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.572
I went home to my region.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.807
I needed time and distance
from you to think.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.476
I know I promised you
so much more

01:50.478 --> 01:52.644
When we were going to scotland,
but I can't leave.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.547
Not when francis has
sent so many troops

01:55.549 --> 01:57.382
To defend my country, my throne.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.585
Oh, you had
to protect your crown, mary.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.320
You did the right thing.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.721
And what about you?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.823
Did I do right by you?

02:07.160 --> 02:10.329
You offered me an affair
in the home of your husband.

02:10.331 --> 02:13.332
I'm offering you <i>me...</i> My love.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.400
These last few weeks
without you...

02:15.402 --> 02:19.238
I felt as though I was dying.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.475
Louis...

02:23.477 --> 02:25.344
Did you come here
to say good-bye?

02:25.346 --> 02:27.913
Or did you hope
that I would?

02:27.915 --> 02:29.681
Because that's not what I want.

02:31.184 --> 02:33.185
I love you.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.487
And I want us to be together.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.698
(horse neighing)

02:46.700 --> 02:48.500
Riding again?

02:48.502 --> 02:49.635
So soon after your injury?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.303
I've healed quickly.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.771
It brings me peace,

02:52.773 --> 02:54.173
Being out in the woods.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.642
You mean, being alone.

02:56.644 --> 02:59.178
I know that this has been
hard on you, too,

02:59.180 --> 03:01.547
Our separation,
but to see you flee

03:01.549 --> 03:04.516
An entire castle just
to avoid being around me...

03:04.518 --> 03:06.185
You needn't worry.
But I do.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.754
I don't want to see you
suffer on my account.

03:08.756 --> 03:09.821
I'm fine, really.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.191
Recovering in all ways.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.293
Well, then, why are you spending
all of your days in the woods?

03:14.295 --> 03:16.562
There's a friend that I've
been passing time with--

03:16.564 --> 03:17.963
Fishing, hunting.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.731
But you don't have any friends.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.934
You have people
you're bound to--

03:21.936 --> 03:24.269
Your brother, me...

03:25.438 --> 03:27.206
Who is this friend?

03:27.208 --> 03:28.640
It's no one you know.

03:28.642 --> 03:32.411
Well, does this <i>friend</i>
<i>have a name?</i>

03:32.413 --> 03:34.880
Breasts? A vagina?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.448
Stop! Yes. Yes, to both.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.983
None of your business,

03:37.985 --> 03:39.985
As your doings
are none of mine.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.953
My lord,

03:40.955 --> 03:43.222
We need you immediately.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.427
Protestant rebels
have seized

03:48.429 --> 03:49.928
The benedictine monastery
outside angers.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.598
There are at least a dozen
of them, heavily armed.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.932
They've rounded up
the children,

03:53.934 --> 03:55.434
Killed all the guards
and the monks.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.835
Oh, my god.

03:56.837 --> 03:57.936
Save two who managed to escape.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.504
I just heard.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.939
How many are dead?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.308
At least 40. 19 hostages.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.977
If the boys are still alive.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.011
Francis:
Children.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.346
What are these radicals doing?

04:07.348 --> 04:08.714
Ransoming them, or do they plan

04:08.716 --> 04:10.249
To slaughter them, as well?

04:10.251 --> 04:11.383
It's further retaliation for

04:11.385 --> 04:12.484
Sending our troops
into scotland.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.852
For supporting me,
a catholic queen.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.754
I knew that there would be
consequences.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.689
France had
to honor its alliance.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.691
Francis, the parents,
some of the local nobles

04:19.693 --> 04:22.327
Are beginning to gather
to meet with us.

04:22.329 --> 04:26.031
(bell tolling in distance)

04:26.033 --> 04:29.034
Has general savoy
and his men returned?

04:29.036 --> 04:31.770
He's still in scotland
doing another advance sweep,

04:31.772 --> 04:32.838
In the borderlands.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.340
We'll put together
a team from the castle,

04:35.342 --> 04:36.975
As many soldiers
as we can spare.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.744
These men aren't trained
for that type of mission.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.612
Extracting children
from an armed assault.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.980
The boys could die in the melee.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.850
Prepare them anyway,
as a last resort.

04:50.923 --> 04:53.425
What are you doing
to save our sons?

04:54.994 --> 04:57.296
We are sending envoys to
negotiate their release,

04:57.298 --> 04:59.564
And if that fails,
we will secure

04:59.566 --> 05:01.466
The safest possible
route to rescue them.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.802
This scum would
never have dared

05:03.804 --> 05:04.936
To take our sons hostage,

05:04.938 --> 05:07.472
Or kill men of god,
if our army were here.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.974
(group murmuring)
count, watch your tongue.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.444
I know that you fear
for the life of your son,

05:12.446 --> 05:14.579
But you are addressing
your sovereign king.

05:16.516 --> 05:19.551
These rebels will be
captured and hanged,

05:19.553 --> 05:21.486
And I will do everything
in this nation's power

05:21.488 --> 05:23.021
To return your sons
to you safely.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.656
Mary:
We know there is nothing

05:24.658 --> 05:26.558
More precious to you
than your children,

05:26.560 --> 05:30.462
And we will defend them
as if they were our own.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.699
Come, let us leave the king
to attend to your sons.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.568
(murmuring)

05:37.670 --> 05:39.738
(sighs)

05:41.708 --> 05:42.908
What's wrong?

05:42.910 --> 05:45.711
Those poor boys
must be terrified,

05:45.713 --> 05:47.479
Trapped by violent men,

05:47.481 --> 05:48.980
Not knowing if they're
going to die.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.116
You can't even imagine, francis.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.985
We will save them.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.655
And you are safe...
Here with me.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.027
Man (in distance):
Welcome back, my lord!

06:08.735 --> 06:10.569
Conde:
Follow me.
I...

06:10.571 --> 06:11.903
Man (in distance):
To your chambers, my lord?

06:11.905 --> 06:14.072
I was coming to
tell you that

06:14.074 --> 06:15.741
CondÃ© had returned to court.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.976
He was gone for weeks.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.079
I'm sorry
if you thought it was over.

06:21.081 --> 06:24.082
Well... You were planning

06:24.084 --> 06:27.152
To abandon our marriage,
flee France

06:27.154 --> 06:28.987
And run off
with my cousin, so...

06:30.123 --> 06:31.656
...I no longer
care what you do.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.166
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

06:43.836 --> 06:46.171
â™ª they all need something

06:46.173 --> 06:51.076
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

06:51.078 --> 06:54.713
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

06:54.715 --> 06:58.617
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

06:58.619 --> 07:01.787
â™ª

07:12.031 --> 07:13.698
<i>(catherine sighs)</i>

07:13.700 --> 07:18.470
Francis... He's under
so much pressure.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.906
Those poor boys
at the monastery,

07:20.908 --> 07:23.008
Shortage of troops,

07:23.010 --> 07:24.810
And now condÃ© has returned.

07:24.812 --> 07:28.213
How that bourbon continues
to keep his head, I don't know.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.082
The way that he has
taken advantage of mary

07:31.084 --> 07:33.685
At such a vulnerable time.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.120
Vulnerable? How?

07:36.789 --> 07:38.156
It doesn't matter.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.158
Every time I see him

07:40.160 --> 07:41.760
I want to tear him to pieces,

07:41.762 --> 07:43.595
I want to crush him in my fist.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.098
You... Are so frustrated.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.600
Oh...

07:48.602 --> 07:51.069
Well, not the least of which
because I have to endure

07:51.071 --> 07:54.539
A freezing carriage every
time I crave your touch.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.911
Well... It won't be long

07:59.913 --> 08:01.680
Before I am slipping

08:01.682 --> 08:05.650
Into your warm, royal bed.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.919
(chuckles)
I have a few ideas

08:07.921 --> 08:10.689
About my return
to court already.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.992
Do you never stop calculating?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.694
No.
Hmm?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.162
Never.
Mm.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.164
General renaude can help us

08:19.166 --> 08:20.165
With one plan.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.700
And the other...

08:21.702 --> 08:23.068
Could dispatch

08:23.070 --> 08:24.536
The prince of condÃ©
permanently.

08:24.538 --> 08:25.770
How?

08:25.772 --> 08:27.772
Are you just teasing me?

08:27.774 --> 08:29.608
It does come
with a caveat.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.276
A few men would have to die.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.712
Men die every day in France.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.746
I'm listening.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.081
I'll tell you after.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.917
I don't want you
satisfied that quickly.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.291
I can't believe bash
has already moved on.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.793
He could fall in love with
a mushroom if he had to.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.061
In love?

08:50.063 --> 08:51.730
She sounds more like
a hunting chum.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.064
She's not.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.733
You were ready
to leave bash for antoine.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.668
Do you want him back?
No.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.803
We'd still have the same
problems between us.

08:58.805 --> 09:01.740
You know, he wouldn't spend
a moment at home with me,

09:01.742 --> 09:03.141
Yet he would happily
die for a stranger,

09:03.143 --> 09:04.876
If it were for a noble cause.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.178
At least you no longer have
to feel guilty for leaving him.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.713
There is that.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.682
And besides,
I really shouldn't complain.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.717
Look at us-- we have all
the luxuries imaginable,

09:12.719 --> 09:14.953
And yet poor greer is
living god knows where.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.955
Oh, I know.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.057
The money we're taking her
should help a little bit.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.860
Whatever her new place
looks like, don't say a word.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.897
It's bound
to be ghastly.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.201
Right this way.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.607
(clears throat)
greer, how can
you afford this?

09:35.609 --> 09:37.776
And who are your
new housemates?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.744
They're not my housemates,

09:39.746 --> 09:42.814
Though, uh, they do...

09:42.816 --> 09:44.316
Live here with me.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.785
They are my workers.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.787
Working girls.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.790
(gasps anxiously)

09:51.792 --> 09:53.191
I am a madam.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.726
A what?
Uh...

09:54.728 --> 09:56.761
I suppose you could say
I fell into it.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.697
And as it turns out,

09:58.699 --> 10:00.165
I'm quite good at it.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.067
I think you're being modest.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.870
It's not the ideal vocation,
I'll admit.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.272
But it pays well,

10:07.274 --> 10:09.774
And I'm in charge of my life
for the very first time.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.111
I hope you won't judge me
too harshly for it.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.081
Greer, we love you.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.215
We want you
to be happy

10:17.217 --> 10:18.883
And taken care of.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.086
I am happy, most days.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.887
Though,
just this morning,

10:22.889 --> 10:24.789
I tried to buy damask
for some drapes

10:24.791 --> 10:26.891
And the proprietor
nearly threw me out.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.194
It turns out her husband
is a frequent visitor.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.395
Lola:
Oh, no.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.263
That's horrible.
On the other hand,

10:32.265 --> 10:33.832
My new profession does require

10:33.834 --> 10:34.899
That I have champagne
at the ready

10:34.901 --> 10:36.267
At all times.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.803
You know what I just realized?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.672
We're all basically

10:40.674 --> 10:43.742
Fallen women-- an unwed
mother, a divorcÃ©e...

10:43.744 --> 10:47.679
Eventually, and now a madam.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.714
So I say to hell with
what people think.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.187
Do it.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.959
You should be able to place them
without being seen.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.028
Complete with condÃ©'s seal.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.963
No one watches the dead.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.974
The scouts have reported back.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.309
The hostages are scattered
throughout the monastery,

11:18.311 --> 11:19.744
Making it impossible

11:19.746 --> 11:21.746
For us to rescue
all the boys at once.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.915
And there are still no demands?

11:23.917 --> 11:25.684
The radicals refuse
to make contact.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.018
That's not
the worst of it.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.420
These men have gunpowder--

11:28.422 --> 11:29.854
At least 30 barrels of it,

11:29.856 --> 11:31.256
From what our scouts could see.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.792
No, they can't...

11:33.794 --> 11:36.061
They're going to kill
themselves and the boys.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.964
If they have no demands,
what are they waiting for?

11:39.966 --> 11:41.700
They're waiting
for word to spread.

11:41.702 --> 11:42.901
The longer we fear

11:42.903 --> 11:44.335
For those boys, the stronger

11:44.337 --> 11:46.271
And more powerful
that fear becomes.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.972
Once they feel
the terror's taken hold,

11:47.974 --> 11:49.074
They'll ignite the gunpowder.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.375
Making a name for themselves,

11:50.377 --> 11:52.010
And their cause,
that we will never forget.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.978
All this because I sent troops
to scotland for you.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.881
I honored our alliance
and our marriage

11:56.883 --> 11:59.451
After what you planned
to do-- abandon me

11:59.453 --> 12:01.786
And France to run away
with your lover.

12:01.788 --> 12:02.954
Mary:
I was leaving

12:02.956 --> 12:04.956
To reclaim my country
and my throne.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.791
You would've done the same.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.995
We can't predict

12:10.997 --> 12:12.964
When their madness
will decide to end this.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.265
Those boys could die
at any minute.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.333
Well, we can't wait any longer.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.468
Take your men,

12:16.470 --> 12:17.869
And free them now.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.003
I will carry out your word.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.171
And if need be, I will gladly

12:20.173 --> 12:21.840
Lay down my life
for those children.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.007
But you should know...

12:23.009 --> 12:23.875
The men we have are not right

12:23.877 --> 12:25.176
For this mission.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.012
May god be with us.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.310
Archers ready?

12:59.312 --> 13:01.146
It'll be any moment now.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.281
(grunting)

13:04.784 --> 13:06.317
All clear.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.153
Let's go.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.478
Bash:
Something's wrong.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.946
Stop!

13:34.948 --> 13:36.114
Fall back now!

13:36.116 --> 13:38.216
Fall back!
(grunting, shouting)

13:48.494 --> 13:50.195
I cannot begin to fathom

13:50.197 --> 13:52.263
The hatred of someone
willing to hurt children.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.599
And their hatred
only incites more.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.202
Not just against the radicals,
but against all protestants.

13:57.204 --> 14:01.172
And louis; the timing for
his return couldn't be worse.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.441
What about the timing
for you and francis?

14:03.443 --> 14:04.976
Francis and I?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.411
CondÃ© left so abruptly.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.612
And you said yourself
you weren't sure

14:07.614 --> 14:09.047
Where you stood with him,

14:09.049 --> 14:11.049
Now that you're
not going to scotland.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.117
You're here. In France.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.619
With francis.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.589
Francis tolerates me
in my duty as queen.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.892
But there is nothing left
of our marriage to salvage.

14:20.894 --> 14:24.362
Do you honestly believe there's
still hope for you and condÃ©?

14:24.364 --> 14:27.298
We knew that being together
wasn't going to be easy.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.635
But louis has risked
so much for me.

14:30.637 --> 14:34.038
Mary, I understand
what he has done for you.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.306
He has helped you through

14:35.308 --> 14:38.142
A terrible, painful time.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.144
Is it possible you might

14:40.146 --> 14:42.213
Be confusing
gratitude with love?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.916
I'm not going to abandon him.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.087
Bash:
<i>The scouts reported</i>

14:49.089 --> 14:50.655
There were only two rebels
in the eastern grounds.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.091
But after the raid, they
admitted they hadn't been sure.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.559
Those boys' lives
are still at risk

14:54.561 --> 14:56.127
Because your men weren't sure?

14:56.129 --> 14:58.263
These men trained
for conflicts so large

14:58.265 --> 15:00.231
That a few men would never
turn the tides of battle.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.567
These are good soldiers, but
they were the wrong soldiers,

15:02.569 --> 15:04.469
And now three of them
are dead because of it.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.938
We knew this was a risk.
Mary: The rebels have

15:06.940 --> 15:08.172
Now been alerted.
They'll be quick

15:08.174 --> 15:10.074
To light that gunpowder
if we try again.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.043
Bash:
Yes. No one in that monastery

15:12.045 --> 15:13.344
Will survive our next mistake.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.147
Francis, general renaude
has men at the ready.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.650
They are trained
for this type of warfare.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.051
And loyal to narcisse.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.353
I wish that I
could trust narcisse.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.223
But everything that he touches
just spills more blood.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.424
I only know renaude
by reputation.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.126
He's mercenary
and ambitious,

15:28.128 --> 15:29.994
But he's good, very good.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.098
Take the offer.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.504
Bash is right.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.606
No matter
what narcisse's motives,

15:41.608 --> 15:44.208
If renaude can get
those boys out safe...

15:44.210 --> 15:45.510
He's our only option.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.247
Do it.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.415
And bring them back.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.250
Ready my horse.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.618
And send word
to general renaude.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.521
Be careful.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.256
I don't trust narcisse,
and least of all,

15:58.258 --> 15:59.524
When he's doing the right thing.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.193
I will.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.296
I saw something
at the monastery

16:05.298 --> 16:06.364
You need to know about.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.466
Bodies of some
of the radicals

16:08.468 --> 16:10.702
That died in the initial assault

16:10.704 --> 16:12.971
Were laying on the ground
just outside the gate.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.273
Some of them bore condÃ©'s crest.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.441
(sighs)

16:16.443 --> 16:18.176
Word that condÃ©'s a traitor

16:18.178 --> 16:19.644
Would spread like
wildfire, but...

16:19.646 --> 16:21.713
Why align himself
with these fanatics?

16:21.715 --> 16:23.481
He's accepted at court,
he has mary's protection,

16:23.483 --> 16:24.716
He has everything that he wants.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.351
I don't know.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.087
But while condÃ© was away,
he met with protestant leaders

16:29.089 --> 16:31.556
Who were furious with you
for sending troops to scotland.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.192
And our spies
tell us that even once

16:34.194 --> 16:37.228
Moderate protestants speak of
rebellion behind closed doors.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.197
You think condÃ© is with them?
And it's possible that,

16:39.199 --> 16:41.265
In rebellion,
condÃ© sees a path to power.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.734
If condÃ© had anything
to do with this,

16:42.736 --> 16:44.268
Nothing will keep him safe.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.617
What do we know, joubert?

16:59.619 --> 17:01.185
General renaude,
we disabled the water pumps,

17:01.187 --> 17:03.721
Forcing the radicals
to use the stream.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.090
We captured two of them,
and through interrogation,

17:06.092 --> 17:08.359
We confirmed their numbers--
24 armed men.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.594
What of the boys?

17:09.596 --> 17:11.262
The gunpowder and
most of the boys

17:11.264 --> 17:12.397
Are being held at the chapel.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.364
Other hostages are being held

17:13.366 --> 17:14.399
In the dormitories.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.400
Good work, lieutenant.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.702
Bash and I will take the chapel.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.037
Joubert, the dormitories.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.104
Move out.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.406
Several men:
Yes, sir!

17:21.408 --> 17:22.507
Man:
Move out!

17:26.412 --> 17:28.279
(boy crying quietly)

17:32.284 --> 17:34.819
(grunts)

17:37.689 --> 17:38.489
Man:
They're here!

17:48.600 --> 17:50.334
Stop him!

17:50.336 --> 17:52.136
The gunpowder!

17:52.138 --> 17:53.304
(grunts)

17:55.607 --> 17:57.542
(boys crying quietly)

18:00.379 --> 18:02.780
Take up defensive positions.
Others may be on their way.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.348
I'm going to check
on the dormitories.

18:04.350 --> 18:07.285
Go. We'll take it from here.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.488
Bash:
It's all right.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.857
You're safe.

18:14.526 --> 18:15.593
(knocking twice)

18:17.229 --> 18:19.330
Any news of the raid?
No, your grace.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.598
Lord condÃ© for you.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.336
Thank you for meeting
with me, lord condÃ©.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.506
Please inform me when you
receive news from angers.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.246
Why did you come to me
so openly?

18:35.248 --> 18:36.447
Is something wrong?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.748
One of my footmen
just informed me

18:37.750 --> 18:39.417
That some of my men
were found dead

18:39.419 --> 18:41.352
Amongst the radicals who
overtook the monastery.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.489
Louis, I'm sorry
to ask this but...

18:44.491 --> 18:46.691
I had no part in
this attack, mary.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.426
I'm not a traitor.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.129
Those bodies were planted
there to blame me.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.864
Francis can't
accuse me of treason

18:52.866 --> 18:54.532
Without also condemning you.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.134
He'll find another
way to be rid of me.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.735
Despite his personal feelings,

18:57.737 --> 19:00.438
Francis would never fabricate
evidence against you.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.440
You know I don't share
your trust in him.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.375
But even if you are right,

19:04.377 --> 19:06.477
It doesn't change anything.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.747
My enemies in court
multiply by the day.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.616
Francis and catherine hate me
for being with you.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.351
The rest hate me
for being protestant.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.520
They want my head, mary!

19:15.522 --> 19:17.522
Francis will protect you.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.590
He will see through
these false accusations.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.193
If I were francis,
I'd want me dead.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.328
But even if he's too good
a man to see it through,

19:24.330 --> 19:26.564
Then there's catherine
and her new lapdog narcisse.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.199
They'll find a way.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.368
If not this time, the next.

19:32.404 --> 19:33.471
I have to leave court.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.573
Maybe even France.

19:37.543 --> 19:41.379
Come with me to scotland.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.247
It's our last chance,

19:43.249 --> 19:44.782
The only way we can
be together, mary.

19:46.218 --> 19:49.320
I love you.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.590
But you know I can't go.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.395
Then that's it, then.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.566
I'm so sorry!

20:01.568 --> 20:02.867
I thought that our love would...

20:02.869 --> 20:04.535
Would be enough?

20:04.537 --> 20:05.870
No, you didn't.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.371
You warned me

20:07.373 --> 20:10.608
And warned me...
That you are queen.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.380
Louis, whatever you do,
you can't run.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.217
Stay until we have reclaimed
the monastery.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.686
And I will talk to francis.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.557
You gave me back my life.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.759
Now, let me save yours.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.464
All right.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.578
We cleared out
the rest of the monastery.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.747
16 men, including the chapel.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.315
Eight in the dormitories.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.918
So all the radicals
are accounted for.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.755
They killed two of the boys
in the commoners' dormitory

20:57.757 --> 20:59.824
Before we could stop them.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.662
Where's your
lieutenant joubert?

21:04.664 --> 21:05.997
Dead.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.598
Knife to the chest.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.379
You heard the rumors
about condÃ©.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.647
He had no part
of the attack.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.515
The nobles are already
calling for his head.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.518
Now that the children are safe,
I'll summon him for questioning.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.054
Those men were planted
there to implicate him.

21:30.056 --> 21:33.057
I know you are angry with me,
and you have every right to be.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.892
But don't let that
cloud your judgment.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.594
CondÃ© is innocent!

21:36.596 --> 21:38.663
You cannot know that.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.532
Two boys were killed
in the monastery.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.435
Now, I swore that I would
protect you being with condÃ©,

21:44.437 --> 21:46.904
But I will not turn a blind eye
to evidence of his involvement.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.540
I understand why you
no longer trust me,

21:49.542 --> 21:50.741
But trust what
you know of him.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.976
What I know of him?

21:53.078 --> 21:55.713
He took advantage of you

21:55.715 --> 21:57.515
When you were
at your most vulnerable.

21:57.517 --> 22:02.353
He knew the horrors that you had
endured and saw an opportunity.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.689
He stole my wife.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.691
The affair isn't condÃ©'s fault.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.858
It's mine.

22:08.927 --> 22:10.728
I turned to him
so many times.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.764
I turned to him because
I couldn't turn to you.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.600
Because the thought of coming
back to this room again,

22:16.602 --> 22:18.436
Where those men
assaulted me, I...

22:20.439 --> 22:22.907
Because the love in
your eyes made it feel

22:22.909 --> 22:25.343
Like I was drowning
in those memories,

22:25.345 --> 22:27.578
And I couldn't...

22:27.580 --> 22:30.581
I couldn't do that,
I had to survive.

22:30.583 --> 22:35.619
I cannot abandon him because
I led him down this path.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.922
CondÃ© is still the man
you thought he was.

22:37.924 --> 22:42.426
He deserves your trust,
even if I do not.

22:46.832 --> 22:49.633
I'll speak to the nobles.

22:51.002 --> 22:54.638
Contempt alone is not enough
to condemn a man.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.507
Even the contempt of a king.

22:56.509 --> 22:57.942
Thank you, francis.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.844
Thank you.

23:04.616 --> 23:07.551
Lord condÃ©.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.387
I don't believe
we're acquainted.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.788
We have mutual friends.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.624
I'm lord akers.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.793
Elizabeth's envoy.
You've received my messages.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.695
I nearly believed that
you cared more for your status

23:17.697 --> 23:20.765
At the french court
than a marriage to elizabeth.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.967
No, I-I'm still interested,

23:22.969 --> 23:24.802
But as a prince of the blood,

23:24.804 --> 23:26.804
Marrying without the consent
of my king is treason.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.707
With the discovery of your men
among the monastery radicals,

23:29.709 --> 23:31.776
Your life is
already at risk.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.878
My men were left there to stir
catholic prejudice against me.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.680
Prejudice may fan
the flames,

23:36.682 --> 23:39.784
But I believe your relationship
with queen mary is the spark.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.720
Or are you innocent
of that, as well?

23:44.656 --> 23:46.657
If you think
there's truth to it,

23:46.659 --> 23:48.559
Then why entertain
my marriage offer?

23:49.828 --> 23:51.662
Because it doesn't matter.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.465
Elizabeth will not hold
this dalliance against you.

23:54.467 --> 23:57.768
Regardless, my queen's
interest is firm,

23:57.770 --> 24:00.671
So the decision is yours--
face your fate in France,

24:00.673 --> 24:02.873
Or seek elizabeth's
hand in marriage.

24:05.544 --> 24:08.446
In France, the only fate
left for me is a noose.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.185
I can leave
for England immediately

24:14.187 --> 24:16.020
So that elizabeth
may make her decision.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.888
Elizabeth's decision
is already made.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.590
She faces fierce and
immediate threats

24:19.592 --> 24:21.592
From those who want
a man on the throne.

24:21.594 --> 24:22.893
To stem these threats,

24:22.895 --> 24:25.563
Elizabeth intends to marry
as soon as possible.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.798
She desires
a foothold in France.

24:30.235 --> 24:34.705
Queen elizabeth accepts your
offer of marriage, prince condÃ©.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.942
You will be
king consort of England.

24:45.617 --> 24:47.651
â™ª all right, come close...

24:47.653 --> 24:49.787
You must be
the new girls.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.789
You're just in time--
it's a full house tonight.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.858
You better change
your clothes.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.926
No john will open his purse
if he can't see the goods.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.562
No, um, we're not...

24:58.564 --> 25:00.898
What term is
your preference?
Term?

25:00.900 --> 25:02.733
For your profession.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.035
Harlot. Whore.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.204
Courtesan has a nice ring
to it, fancy-like.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.206
Well, then we are
not courtesans.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.208
We're actually here to see
your mistress, greer.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.843
I'll fetch her.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.579
â™ª want to take a chance?

25:15.581 --> 25:17.882
â™ª want to sip this smooth air?

25:17.884 --> 25:21.585
â™ª kick it in the sand...

25:21.587 --> 25:23.821
I'm sure greer will love
this damask we've bought her.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.856
Perhaps we should
leave it here, and go.

25:25.858 --> 25:26.857
He's here.

25:26.859 --> 25:27.858
Who?

25:27.860 --> 25:29.827
That general
I met, renaude.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.830
You go ahead, and I'll
give greer the fabric.

25:32.832 --> 25:35.599
And leave you eyeing
a man in a whorehouse?

25:35.601 --> 25:37.234
Does that sound
like a good idea?

25:37.236 --> 25:38.869
I'm not gonna do anything.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.838
Go ahead, I-I'll just be
with you in a moment.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.909
â™ª I can't take this place

25:44.911 --> 25:47.044
â™ª no, I can't take this place

25:47.046 --> 25:49.046
â™ª I just want to go

25:49.048 --> 25:51.949
â™ª where I can get
some space... â™ª

25:54.219 --> 25:56.220
Lady lola.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.857
I thought I recognized you,
but I assumed I was mistaken.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.259
What reason could
a court lady have

26:02.261 --> 26:04.795
For visiting a
known whorehouse?

26:04.797 --> 26:08.165
The mind vibrates with
the possibilities.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.001
I don't have to explain
my comings and goings to you,

26:11.003 --> 26:12.903
But if you must know,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.271
I was delivering
some cloth to a friend.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.607
Your fallen friend,
lady greer.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.842
I hear that she
is the proprietor

26:18.844 --> 26:21.312
Of this establishment--
industrious girl.

26:21.314 --> 26:24.081
Women often have to be,
in order to survive.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.916
They also need
to be careful.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.985
Even making
friendly deliveries.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.822
Tongues less discreet
than my own will wag.

26:31.824 --> 26:34.358
Even for the mother of
the king's only child.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.828
You mean especially for a woman
known as the king's mistress.

26:37.830 --> 26:41.031
Word of your loyalty
to mary has spread.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.866
You have risen above

26:42.868 --> 26:44.868
Any negative speculation
there was about you.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.104
Your son is esteemed.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.307
Do not let anything
diminish this position

26:50.309 --> 26:52.142
That you have earned.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.845
Why do you care?

26:54.847 --> 26:57.281
I don't know.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.385
But I do.

27:05.824 --> 27:10.661
I would escort you back if
I were still welcome at court,

27:10.663 --> 27:12.029
But, sadly, I'm not.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.298
Good night, lola.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.278
Greer: Thank you
for the beautiful fabric.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.980
Kenna:
Of course.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.849
Did that man
just put on...
A collar, yes.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.250
He likes to be led around.

27:33.252 --> 27:36.920
Death and perversion are
the two great equalizers.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.122
Men from all walks
of life have

27:38.124 --> 27:40.090
Their own desires
and predilections.

27:40.092 --> 27:43.293
And as long as they don't cause
harm, I cater to all of them.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.830
And, uh, what about him?

27:46.832 --> 27:47.898
What's his pleasure?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.434
General renaude?

27:50.436 --> 27:52.936
It's the first time
he's come in.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.938
He and his men overtook
the rebels at the monastery.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.173
Now he's treating them
to the best champagne

27:56.175 --> 27:57.908
And women money can buy.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.810
Generous.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.712
It's the least
he could do.

28:01.714 --> 28:05.015
My girls overheard
his men grumbling.

28:05.017 --> 28:08.185
His right-hand man was killed,
some say unnecessarily.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.187
They blame him.
Why?

28:10.189 --> 28:12.089
There were two groups
of boys that needed saving.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.991
He chose the riskier path
to save the son

28:13.993 --> 28:16.160
Of a very rich noble.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.429
His man died as a result.

28:18.431 --> 28:21.765
If I were you, I'd keep
my distance from him.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.211
You seem troubled.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.814
Not at all.

28:36.816 --> 28:39.049
I'm only surprised at how fast
things are progressing.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.884
There'll be time
for a celebration later.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.254
As I said, queen elizabeth
desires an expeditious union.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.925
Look alive.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.327
It's not every day a man
gets to marry a queen.

28:59.804 --> 29:03.874
â™ª I knock the ice
from my boots â™ª

29:07.112 --> 29:11.181
â™ª try not to feel the cold

29:14.886 --> 29:17.988
â™ª caught in the thought

29:17.990 --> 29:21.458
â™ª of that time

29:21.460 --> 29:23.460
â™ª that everything was fine

29:23.462 --> 29:25.295
â™ª everything was mine...

29:25.297 --> 29:27.998
Take this to lord condÃ©'s
apartments in the village.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.069
Do not make any stops
on your way.

29:33.238 --> 29:35.305
And deliver it directly
to his hands.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.077
â™ª all the king's horses
and all the king's men... â™ª

29:40.079 --> 29:43.046
We are gathered here to marry
prince louis of condÃ©

29:43.048 --> 29:47.017
To her royal majesty,
queen elizabeth of England

29:47.019 --> 29:49.953
As represented
by her appointed proxy.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.322
Despite the great distance

29:52.324 --> 29:53.924
Between the groom
and the bride,

29:53.926 --> 29:56.927
These rites and vows
will be as binding

29:56.929 --> 29:59.396
As if you were standing
side-by-side.

29:59.398 --> 30:02.299
â™ª oh, oh, oh...

30:05.036 --> 30:07.037
â™ª there is a reason

30:07.039 --> 30:10.174
â™ª I'm still standing

30:12.210 --> 30:14.044
â™ª and I never knew

30:14.046 --> 30:17.815
â™ª if I'd be landing

30:20.385 --> 30:24.421
â™ª and I will run fast

30:24.423 --> 30:28.158
â™ª outlast everyone...

30:28.160 --> 30:29.993
I do.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.129
â™ª lasted

30:32.131 --> 30:36.233
â™ª no, oh, oh, oh, oh...

30:36.235 --> 30:39.269
Long live his majesty,
king louis of England.

30:40.305 --> 30:43.073
God save the king.

30:43.075 --> 30:47.477
â™ª all the king's horses
and all the king's men... â™ª

30:49.414 --> 30:52.316
Must be hard to sleep
on one's first night as a king.

30:54.252 --> 30:57.087
Lying next to a sharp
broadsword doesn't help either.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.289
It's tradition.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.925
We must sleep in the same bed
to consummate the marriage,

31:01.927 --> 31:04.194
But the sword is there
to guard the proxy

31:04.196 --> 31:06.163
From becoming
an actual wife.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.199
Does the proxy have a name?

31:09.201 --> 31:11.201
Annabelle breton.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.271
You're lord
breton's daughter?

31:15.573 --> 31:17.374
Your father's
a loyal french lord.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.910
How does his daughter come to be
the proxy of an english queen?

31:19.912 --> 31:22.079
My family is protestant.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.081
I was raised
in english court,

31:24.083 --> 31:26.316
But my heart has always
been with France.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.318
It must have been hard,

31:28.320 --> 31:31.355
Having to forsake
your home, your heart.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.357
It was.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.425
Will you be a good king?

31:37.095 --> 31:39.296
Will you bring
England and France,

31:39.298 --> 31:41.498
Catholic and protestant,
closer together?

31:41.500 --> 31:44.067
So that my family,
and families like mine,

31:44.069 --> 31:47.104
Can feel safe again in the land
that they were born to and love?

31:48.339 --> 31:50.507
I will do all I can...

31:50.509 --> 31:52.976
To be the king your family,

31:52.978 --> 31:55.479
England and France deserve.

31:57.248 --> 32:00.083
Are you eager
to meet her?

32:00.085 --> 32:01.385
Your wife.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.121
Elizabeth.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.189
Would you like me
to tell you about her?

32:06.191 --> 32:08.292
No. Not now.

32:08.294 --> 32:11.962
<i>Tonight, my head and my heart</i>

32:11.964 --> 32:13.597
<i>Are on the life, the people</i>

32:13.599 --> 32:16.466
<i>I leave behind.</i>

32:16.468 --> 32:19.303
Annabelle:
Will you miss France very much?

32:19.305 --> 32:22.339
I will miss her
with all my heart.

32:30.048 --> 32:32.015
Akers:
Dawn's first light

32:32.017 --> 32:33.283
Offers us an advantage--

32:33.285 --> 32:35.452
The road to the port
should be largely unoccupied.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.321
I won't feel safe until
we're aboard that ship

32:37.323 --> 32:38.722
And bound
for England.
Understandably.

32:38.724 --> 32:41.458
Queen elizabeth's
new king consort

32:41.460 --> 32:43.627
Would be a prize captive
for any frenchman.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.663
(bell tolling in distance)

32:46.665 --> 32:49.099
Whoa. Whoa.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.568
Conde: A fire.
It's coming from the village.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.004
The girl, annabelle--
she was still sleeping.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.339
Your majesty,
let me go.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.207
If it's the house, this may be
an attempt on your life.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.709
Wait for me here.

32:58.711 --> 32:59.977
(horse whinnies)

33:04.182 --> 33:07.117
(gentle music playing)

33:07.119 --> 33:09.720
General, your bravery
will not soon be forgotten.

33:09.722 --> 33:13.123
We owe you a great
debt of gratitude.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.725
Men and women: Cheers!
Man: Hear, hear!

33:14.727 --> 33:16.326
Lady kenna.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.260
I trust you enjoyed

33:17.262 --> 33:18.628
Your evening
in the village?

33:18.630 --> 33:20.163
I'm sorry?

33:20.165 --> 33:22.499
A queen's lady...
In a brothel.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.768
So you saw me.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.470
I did.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.272
I heard you were
enjoying your victory.

33:29.274 --> 33:31.675
That's quite the feat,
rescuing all those boys.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.276
Not all of them,
I'm afraid.

33:33.278 --> 33:35.345
One of my own men was lost,
as well.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.613
In the efforts to save
a very rich boy.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.383
I hope it was worth it.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.018
There was a choice
to be made,

33:41.020 --> 33:42.252
Between saving
the nobles' sons

33:42.254 --> 33:44.488
And the common boys.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.057
Either way,
someone would have died.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.759
And you chose...
The money.

33:48.761 --> 33:51.361
And the gratitude
of a very powerful man.

33:53.131 --> 33:55.599
I lost my son two years ago.

33:55.601 --> 33:59.770
He was taken captive
by enemy forces, and now...

33:59.772 --> 34:03.540
I wonder, every day:
Is he alive or dead?

34:03.542 --> 34:05.142
I'm sorry.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.543
Don't be.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.545
These things, they provide
a level of protection

34:08.547 --> 34:10.580
And I won't apologize

34:10.582 --> 34:12.516
For assuring my spot
above the fray.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.318
You're disappointed.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.753
A lady likes to think

34:16.755 --> 34:19.256
The protectors of the realm
are all willing

34:19.258 --> 34:21.358
To sacrifice themselves for--
a lofty cause

34:21.360 --> 34:22.793
Which has nothing
to do with them

34:22.795 --> 34:24.361
Or the people they care about.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.595
No.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.764
I understand the
need for protection.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.533
More so than most.

34:29.535 --> 34:33.170
Your husband showed
great valor in the raid.

34:33.172 --> 34:36.239
I invited him
to join us at the...

34:36.241 --> 34:38.341
Celebration of my exploits.

34:38.343 --> 34:40.477
But he mentioned a woman,

34:40.479 --> 34:42.612
Someone waiting for him.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.147
On the road back,

34:44.149 --> 34:45.449
I watched him peel away
into the woods.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.186
I was pleased
the woman wasn't you.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.620
Why?

34:50.622 --> 34:54.558
I may look out for myself,
lady kenna...

34:54.560 --> 34:57.194
But I don't take things
that don't belong to me.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.463
And it sounds like you

34:59.465 --> 35:01.565
Don't belong to anyone.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.505
(sighs)

35:22.386 --> 35:23.587
Annabelle is dead.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.188
The priest that
performed your wedding

35:25.190 --> 35:26.523
Has been murdered.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.758
And every last document
signifying your union

35:28.760 --> 35:30.827
Has been destroyed.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.362
It seems that someone
is out to erase

35:32.364 --> 35:33.763
All evidence of your wedding,
prince condÃ©.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.566
They've undone the wedding.

35:36.568 --> 35:39.536
We can marry again.
Find another proxy.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.238
I'm afraid that's not
a decision I can make

35:41.240 --> 35:42.372
Without first
consulting my queen.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.607
Who would do this?

35:43.609 --> 35:45.242
Why?

35:45.244 --> 35:46.409
An alliance
between England

35:46.411 --> 35:48.278
And protestant France
threatens many.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.579
I would look first
to the french crown

35:49.581 --> 35:51.515
And then to any of
elizabeth's foes abroad.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.150
This was a careful choice--

35:53.152 --> 35:55.318
Killing the marriage
while saving me.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.786
Well, only one of you needed
to die to sever the contract.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.255
Annabelle is a woman,
while you are

35:58.257 --> 35:59.523
Brother to the king of navarre.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.225
A protestant king
with ties to England.

36:04.462 --> 36:06.663
Maybe it wasn't a foe at all,
but elizabeth herself.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.498
Perhaps she simply

36:08.500 --> 36:09.833
Changed her mind about
marrying me, and didn't want

36:09.835 --> 36:11.368
To kill me and risk
her alliance with navarre.

36:11.370 --> 36:14.504
If I'm wrong,
take me to England.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.406
I will wed elizabeth,
standing by her side.

36:16.408 --> 36:17.941
I can't do that.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.476
Even if the valois
didn't set the fire,

36:19.478 --> 36:20.510
They will find out
what I did soon.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.878
Marrying elizabeth is treason.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.314
You said yourself
it was a great risk.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.349
I turned my back on mary!

36:26.351 --> 36:28.351
Betrayed my allies in France!

36:28.353 --> 36:29.486
All for elizabeth!

36:29.488 --> 36:30.687
Certainly she owes me something!

36:30.689 --> 36:32.222
I don't think her majesty

36:32.224 --> 36:33.557
Would see it that way.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.200
Narcisse:
Word of condÃ©'s involvement

36:43.202 --> 36:44.668
With the radicals
has spread nicely.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.836
But it appears that
I underestimated

36:46.838 --> 36:48.271
The sway that mary

36:48.273 --> 36:50.373
Still holds over your son.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.709
I hear francis
is unconvinced

36:52.711 --> 36:54.878
Of his guilt.
That doesn't
matter anymore.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.479
You won't believe
what condÃ©'s done.

36:57.782 --> 37:00.517
Married the queen of England.

37:00.519 --> 37:01.818
By proxy.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.420
A girl known
to be a member

37:03.422 --> 37:04.955
Of elizabeth's inner circle.

37:04.957 --> 37:07.958
A broadsword was found in
the bed that they shared.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.726
My god.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.797
How do you know this?
There was a fire.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.800
She died. Someone was trying
to erase all legal proof,

37:16.802 --> 37:18.802
But there were
witnesses.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.804
CondÃ© was identified
as one of the newlyweds

37:20.806 --> 37:22.839
At a borrowed noble's house.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.007
Were they successful?

37:24.009 --> 37:26.643
Or is condÃ©
now the king of England?

37:26.645 --> 37:27.877
I don't know.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.813
He fled.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.915
If condÃ© and
elizabeth are married,

37:31.917 --> 37:34.784
Then she has essentially
laid claim to France.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.886
She'll rally the
protestants here,

37:36.888 --> 37:38.822
A french king at her side.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.357
I am well aware.

37:43.694 --> 37:47.831
Did you do this, catherine?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.799
Learn of the wedding

37:49.801 --> 37:51.568
And then have it undone?

37:51.570 --> 37:52.902
No!

37:52.904 --> 37:54.304
Did you,

37:54.306 --> 37:55.572
In some way?

37:55.574 --> 37:56.840
Oh, when tying condÃ©
to the assault

37:56.842 --> 37:58.375
On the monastery wasn't enough?

37:59.877 --> 38:01.378
Maybe you're asking me

38:01.380 --> 38:03.313
To throw suspicion off yourself.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.316
No. But this has a
breadth and a scope

38:06.318 --> 38:07.751
That our plan did not.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.453
This will ruin condÃ©
in France forever.

38:11.989 --> 38:15.292
Is this how it's going to be
from now on?

38:15.294 --> 38:16.960
Both of us constantly

38:16.962 --> 38:19.329
Wondering what
the other is up to?

38:19.331 --> 38:20.864
Yes.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.465
You have met your match.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.434
(sighs)

38:24.436 --> 38:25.669
This is terrible news...
(wry laugh)

38:25.671 --> 38:26.970
...But there is something

38:26.972 --> 38:28.505
Marvelous in that,

38:28.507 --> 38:29.939
Wouldn't you say?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.041
Yeah.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.745
(wind whistling)

38:35.747 --> 38:37.480
What do you have to report?

38:37.482 --> 38:38.915
Lord narcisse

38:38.917 --> 38:40.850
Was seen in the village
last night.
Hmm.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.919
Outside a brothel.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.521
Well, did he go inside?

38:44.523 --> 38:46.356
He never entered
the establishment.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.991
Hmm.
He was merely detained

38:47.993 --> 38:49.059
By a conversation

38:49.061 --> 38:50.660
With lady lola.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.028
Lady lola?

38:52.030 --> 38:53.963
Some time together in the past.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.965
And their exchange this night?

38:55.967 --> 38:57.367
Mere words.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.369
A matter of minutes
and they moved on.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.970
Did they meet again?

39:00.972 --> 39:02.405
No.

39:04.875 --> 39:07.577
And the tenor of their exchange?

39:09.847 --> 39:11.014
Edmond?

39:11.016 --> 39:12.682
Tell me this:

39:12.684 --> 39:14.751
If lady lola were your wife

39:14.753 --> 39:16.553
And you spied her

39:16.555 --> 39:19.589
In an identical encounter

39:19.591 --> 39:22.625
With lord narcisse,

39:22.627 --> 39:24.060
How would you feel?

39:24.062 --> 39:26.996
If it were my wife...

39:28.599 --> 39:29.933
...I'd want him dead.

39:32.002 --> 39:33.603
Thank you for your candor.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.144
(door opens, closes)

39:42.947 --> 39:45.615
Married?

39:45.617 --> 39:47.117
To elizabeth?

39:48.452 --> 39:50.653
It's not true.
It is.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.055
Or was, for however long

39:52.057 --> 39:53.957
Their marriage
may have lasted.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.959
No one knows if the arson
and murders undid their union,

39:55.961 --> 39:57.994
Or if condÃ©

39:57.996 --> 40:00.563
Fled France
king consort of England.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.934
Louis was approached

40:04.936 --> 40:07.670
By elizabeth's envoy
some weeks ago.

40:08.939 --> 40:10.106
He told me so himself.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.975
You knew about this?

40:11.977 --> 40:14.010
That condÃ© was courting England?

40:14.012 --> 40:15.412
Our greatest enemy--

40:15.414 --> 40:17.514
<i>Your</i> greatest enemy?

40:17.516 --> 40:19.516
He swore to me that he would
reject her proposal.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.950
And you believed him.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.585
If he did this,
it's only because

40:22.587 --> 40:24.454
He felt he had no other choice.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.022
I abandoned him.

40:26.024 --> 40:27.424
I sent troops
to scotland for you--

40:27.426 --> 40:28.658
To honor your needs,

40:28.660 --> 40:30.126
Your nation's needs.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.061
And still, you choose
to lie to me.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.130
There were things
I could not share with you.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.466
Or that condÃ©
couldn't share with me.

40:36.468 --> 40:40.036
But he has done this, francis,
because I ended things.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.173
It's over between us.

40:43.175 --> 40:46.142
I honored
my loyalty to France.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.945
I chose to stand by my husband.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.013
As your queen, if not your wife.

40:50.015 --> 40:53.116
An important distinction.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.118
I came back to do
the right thing.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.053
Just as I am trying to do now,

40:57.055 --> 40:58.688
By telling you the truth
about condÃ©.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.457
Am I supposed
to thank you for this?

41:01.959 --> 41:04.027
Yes, you did do the right thing,
mary, politically.

41:05.029 --> 41:06.463
Staying in France,

41:06.465 --> 41:08.631
Staying with me,
secures the alliance

41:08.633 --> 41:10.066
And your throne in scotland.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.468
That's not the only reason...

41:11.470 --> 41:14.037
Which makes you no
different from condÃ©.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.473
He chose elizabeth
for the same reason:

41:16.475 --> 41:18.475
To secure a political future.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.077
And now we will suffer
the consequences.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.213
If elizabeth has
a stronghold in France

41:23.215 --> 41:25.482
And condÃ©'s claim
to the throne...

41:25.484 --> 41:28.051
This may mean
the end of our reign.
