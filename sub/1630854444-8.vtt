05:48.250 --> 05:49.583
What did she say?

06:31.083 --> 06:32.333
That's impossible.

06:35.666 --> 06:36.666
What?

06:37.333 --> 06:38.791
What did she say?

06:39.791 --> 06:43.333
She wants to know
if we remember boarding the ship.

06:45.416 --> 06:47.208
What?

06:52.125 --> 06:55.083
Can someone explain
what everyone is talking about, please?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.041
Mother was right.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.291
We should never have gotten
onto this ship.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.333
Now everyone is dead.

10:33.416 --> 10:34.833
Olek is dead.

10:34.916 --> 10:36.666
My mother is dead.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.500
I'm not staying here one minute longer.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.250
I'm going to get off this ship.

11:13.291 --> 11:15.125
Let's get off this ship.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.000
Wait, where are you going?

11:25.583 --> 11:26.833
They want to get off the ship.

16:03.625 --> 16:04.958
What's happening?

16:21.708 --> 16:22.750
Shit.

16:25.458 --> 16:26.416
It's moving.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.000
Fuck.

16:31.333 --> 16:32.458
What is this?

16:34.250 --> 16:35.166
Quick! This way!

16:46.083 --> 16:47.791
Let's go. Let's go, quick!

16:54.916 --> 16:55.875
Where did they go?

16:56.916 --> 16:57.833
Hey!

17:08.291 --> 17:10.875
Whatever's going on,
I'm getting off this ship now.

17:11.916 --> 17:14.000
There must be a way out of here.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.375
Wait. Where are you going?
We already lost the others!

17:23.916 --> 17:26.375
We should go back.
Find the doctor and the captain.

23:13.041 --> 23:15.416
The doors,
where are the doors?

23:27.291 --> 23:29.458
There are no doors.
Where did they go?

23:30.666 --> 23:31.708
There's a door.

23:35.791 --> 23:36.875
Hurry, this way.

23:40.791 --> 23:41.916
No!

24:05.166 --> 24:06.083
Come on!

24:17.125 --> 24:18.375
Where are we?

24:31.958 --> 24:33.916
No. No.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.583
No!

24:35.666 --> 24:37.041
Where are we?

24:46.875 --> 24:48.208
It can't be true.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.500
Is there someone in there?

25:43.083 --> 25:44.166
Where are we?

25:44.250 --> 25:46.000
How did we get here?

25:46.083 --> 25:47.208
Help me!

25:48.166 --> 25:49.041
Clémence!

25:49.125 --> 25:50.041
It's over there.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.083
- Ling Yi!
-Mei Mei!

26:07.166 --> 26:09.250
Help me out of here!

26:10.708 --> 26:12.083
No!

26:12.708 --> 26:13.791
Don't go!

26:13.875 --> 26:15.791
Don't go. Help me!

26:48.000 --> 26:49.041
Ramiro!

26:49.625 --> 26:52.375
-Ángel!
-Ramiro, please, help me!

26:52.458 --> 26:54.541
I don't understand. Why are you alive?

26:55.291 --> 26:56.541
And why am I here?

26:58.625 --> 27:00.166
- Clémence!
-Lucien?

27:02.333 --> 27:03.625
We're getting you out of there!

27:16.875 --> 27:19.541
It will be all right.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.666
Dear God.

28:15.958 --> 28:16.875
Come.

28:16.958 --> 28:18.208
We need to get out of here!

30:06.958 --> 30:08.791
How did you get here?

30:08.875 --> 30:13.291
Ángel. Have you seen him?
He was down in the well and now…

30:16.083 --> 30:18.250
Olek? Have you seen Olek?

30:19.041 --> 30:20.000
What's the matter?

30:23.291 --> 30:24.666
Has anyone seen Olek?

30:25.958 --> 30:27.250
He didn't die!

30:27.333 --> 30:28.166
What?

30:28.250 --> 30:29.916
He was here just now!

30:41.083 --> 30:42.333
Ángel?

30:44.333 --> 30:46.125
-Ángel?
- Hey, where are you going?

30:46.833 --> 30:47.791
Where's he going?

30:47.875 --> 30:50.541
I don't know.
But the engine room should be this way.

30:51.833 --> 30:52.708
Let’s go!

31:39.833 --> 31:40.916
You knew.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.791
You knew what was going on the whole time.

32:21.875 --> 32:23.416
I'm sorry, Captain.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.250
Ángel?

38:29.375 --> 38:30.708
What's happening?
