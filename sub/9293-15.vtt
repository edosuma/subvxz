00:13.000 --> 00:15.767
The Americans know
our location.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.668
 <i>We need to launch the drone</i>

00:18.733 --> 00:19.900
before they close in.

00:19.967 --> 00:22.700
We'll find a way to deliver
the other two bombs.

00:22.767 --> 00:24.301
GREDENKO:
Launch the drone.

00:30.634 --> 00:31.967
I can't find the drone.

00:32.034 --> 00:33.634
Readjust based on
projected vectors.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.833
I'm doing that now, General.

00:34.900 --> 00:35.900
It's just not where
it's supposed to be!

00:35.967 --> 00:37.201
WALSH:
Until you find it,

00:37.267 --> 00:39.534
I'll have my F-16s
stay in a holding pattern.

00:39.601 --> 00:41.767
We figured out how the drone
was able to stay hidden

00:41.833 --> 00:43.000
from our satellites.

00:43.067 --> 00:44.401
Whoever is piloting it
is able to anticipate

00:44.467 --> 00:45.900
our repositioning directives.

00:45.967 --> 00:47.100
 <i>How can he</i>
 <i>do that?</i>

00:47.167 --> 00:48.367
 <i>Our satellite data</i>
 <i>is being relayed</i>

00:48.434 --> 00:51.100
to the drone pilot
through a workstation here.

00:51.167 --> 00:52.467
We have a leak.

00:52.534 --> 00:54.467
We have to find out who's
subverting our system.

00:54.534 --> 00:55.800
It isNadia.

00:55.867 --> 00:57.934
The signature trace
matches her computer.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.167
Surrender
your station.

00:59.234 --> 01:01.034
Who are you streaming
our satellite data to?

01:01.100 --> 01:02.067
What?!

01:04.066 --> 01:07.733
I will do what's necessary
to get the answers I need.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.900
Let her go.

01:08.967 --> 01:10.634
What the hell are you doing?

01:10.700 --> 01:12.467
We got the drone
pilot's location.

01:14.267 --> 01:16.134
We're not through
with her, Milo.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.100
BUCHANAN:
Jack, what's your status?

01:23.167 --> 01:25.234
The drone pilot is down.
I'm at his controls now.

01:25.301 --> 01:27.601
 <i>The target is San Francisco.</i>

01:27.668 --> 01:29.634
There is no way to deactivate
the bomb remotely.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.733
I'm fighting a stall.
I'm losing control of the drone.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.900
I need to find a place
to land it now.

01:38.700 --> 01:39.934
MORRIS:
 <i>None of the first responders</i>

01:40.000 --> 01:41.833
in San Francisco
are reporting a detonation.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.134
 <i>The bomb did not go off</i>
 <i>on impact.</i>

01:44.201 --> 01:45.634
Move out!

01:45.700 --> 01:47.867
There's radioactive material
in this area!

01:47.934 --> 01:50.201
BUCHANAN:
We were able to take control
of the aircraft,

01:50.267 --> 01:51.434
crash-landing it
in an industrial park

01:51.501 --> 01:52.800
at the edge of the city.

01:52.867 --> 01:55.301
But in the process,
the bomb's nuclear core

01:55.367 --> 01:58.434
was compromised and radioactive
material was released.

01:58.501 --> 02:01.668
So what we're essentially
dealing with is a dirty bomb.

02:01.733 --> 02:02.967
Sir,
it was a radiological spill.

02:03.034 --> 02:04.867
It was an attack on our nation.

02:04.934 --> 02:07.201
I warned the ambassador, Tom.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.533
We were led to believe
that this warning shot

02:09.601 --> 02:12.534
would be fired only
in response to the detonation

02:12.601 --> 02:14.000
of a nuclear device.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.201
They need to see
with their own eyes

02:16.267 --> 02:17.867
that I will answer this threat

02:17.934 --> 02:19.601
with an in-kind
military response.

02:20.967 --> 02:21.900
The order's given.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.234
Launch the missile

02:24.301 --> 02:25.568
as soon as they're in range.

02:35.601 --> 02:37.234
Prep two units
of fresh plasma.

02:37.301 --> 02:38.867
You need to keep him alive.

02:38.934 --> 02:40.401
Gredenko's got two more
bombs out there.

02:40.467 --> 02:42.267
Right now this man's
our only link to them.

02:42.334 --> 02:44.234
Jack! I just
talked to CTU.

02:44.301 --> 02:45.367
There's a situation developing

02:45.434 --> 02:46.833
where the drone went down.
What?

02:46.900 --> 02:49.000
The casing on the
nuclear bomb, it cracked.

02:49.067 --> 02:51.067
There's been some dispersal
into the atmosphere.
How bad is the fallout?

02:51.134 --> 02:52.267
A dozen first-responders
were exposed to high levels,

02:52.334 --> 02:54.267
but casualties
should be minimal.

02:54.334 --> 02:56.201
Wind vectors are okay
so far, and they're
starting to evacuate.

02:56.267 --> 02:57.501
Okay. I want you
to go through

02:57.568 --> 02:58.767
the pilot's databases
and electronic files.

02:58.833 --> 03:01.900
I want you to see if you can
find any link to Gredenko.

03:03.568 --> 03:04.700
Agent Bauer.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.000
He didn't make it.

03:07.067 --> 03:09.568
Damn it.

03:10.634 --> 03:11.568
Buchanan.

03:11.634 --> 03:12.733
Bill, it's Jack.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.900
What did you get
from the drone pilot?

03:14.967 --> 03:16.800
No, he's dead.
We've been
running down

03:16.867 --> 03:17.867
leads on this end.

03:17.934 --> 03:19.067
So far nothing's
come up on Gredenko.

03:19.134 --> 03:20.367
Doyle told me
about the fallout,

03:20.434 --> 03:21.634
but he said it was
containable?

03:21.700 --> 03:23.067
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

03:23.134 --> 03:24.700
The incident has created

03:24.767 --> 03:27.134
some serious policy
complications in Washington.

03:27.201 --> 03:28.534
Like what?

03:28.601 --> 03:30.767
Vice President Daniels has
ordered a nuclear strike

03:30.833 --> 03:32.067
against Fayed's country.

03:32.134 --> 03:34.100
What's he trying to do,
start World War III?

03:34.167 --> 03:35.700
That'll be seen as
an act of aggression

03:35.767 --> 03:37.000
against the entire
Middle East.

03:37.067 --> 03:38.934
Which is why we have to
find Fayed and Gredenko

03:39.000 --> 03:40.201
before Daniels
launches the strike.

03:40.267 --> 03:41.201
When is it happening?

03:41.267 --> 03:42.301
Within the hour.

03:42.367 --> 03:43.334
Bill, that doesn't give us

03:43.401 --> 03:45.867
enough time to find Gredenko.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.000
I'll get back to you.

03:49.401 --> 03:52.267
(phone ringing)

04:13.900 --> 04:15.601
Victor's still not answering.

04:15.668 --> 04:19.367
Because the Americans
found him.

04:19.434 --> 04:21.534
The bomb was supposed
to hit San Francisco

04:21.601 --> 04:24.534
ten minutes ago, but there
is nothing on the news.

04:24.601 --> 04:29.534
Even if you're right,
we are safe here.

04:29.601 --> 04:32.034
Victor doesn't know
our location.

04:33.601 --> 04:35.401
So we can continue
our operations safely.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.867
 <i>What</i> operation?

04:37.934 --> 04:39.867
There is no operation.

04:39.934 --> 04:42.401
It's over because of
you and your people.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.568
No, Fayed, it isn't over.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.833
We have two more bombs.

04:56.833 --> 04:58.034
 <i>I</i> have the bombs.

04:58.100 --> 05:01.867
But you need me
to deliver them.

05:01.934 --> 05:05.034
I'm the only one
who can give you

05:05.100 --> 05:08.201
the targets you want.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.700
Come on, come on,
shoot me now,

05:10.767 --> 05:13.201
or put down the gun.

05:33.267 --> 05:36.833
(phone ringing)

05:36.900 --> 05:37.967
Yeah. 

05:38.034 --> 05:39.534
GREDENKO:
Mark Hauser?

05:39.601 --> 05:40.668
Who's this?

05:40.733 --> 05:42.367
You know who it is.

05:46.467 --> 05:48.501
I already gave you
what you asked for.

05:48.568 --> 05:51.201
But your employer has
tightened security,

05:51.267 --> 05:53.867
so the access I paid
for is no good.

05:53.934 --> 05:55.067
That's not my problem.

05:55.134 --> 05:56.534
It <i>is</i> your problem.

05:56.601 --> 05:59.467
It became your problem the
moment you took my money.

06:02.767 --> 06:04.301
It'll take some time to download

06:04.367 --> 06:05.601
the new security protocols.

06:05.668 --> 06:07.267
How much time?

06:07.334 --> 06:08.934
Half an hour, maybe longer.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.401
I can call you when it's ready.

06:10.467 --> 06:11.934
I'll be there in 40 minutes.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.434
Gredenko.

06:21.434 --> 06:23.100
I'm hungry.

06:26.733 --> 06:28.434
Knock yourself out.

06:28.501 --> 06:30.467
There's peppers in here.

06:30.534 --> 06:31.934
You like peppers.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.967
Not red ones.

06:33.034 --> 06:34.833
I don't eat red food, Mark.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.900
Since when?

06:35.967 --> 06:37.634
I don't like red food.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.800
I'll take the peppers out, okay?

06:47.434 --> 06:48.934
You-You take care of me, Mark.

06:49.000 --> 06:49.934
You-You always...

06:50.000 --> 06:51.767
take care of me.

06:51.833 --> 06:54.034
I do my best, Brady.

06:58.568 --> 06:59.934
While I'm doing this,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.800
I need you to do
something for me.

07:01.867 --> 07:03.067
Okay.

07:04.900 --> 07:08.267
I need you to access some files
from the mainframe at my office.

07:08.334 --> 07:09.700
Can you do that?

07:09.767 --> 07:11.034
Yeah.

07:31.967 --> 07:33.067
GREDENKO:
Let's go.

07:33.134 --> 07:34.501
(engine starts)

07:54.967 --> 07:57.467
Nadia's being processed
as an enemy combatant.

07:59.234 --> 08:02.100
She's being transferred to a
holding station in Temecula.

08:02.167 --> 08:04.833
Sir, I don't know
if I can accept

08:04.900 --> 08:06.100
that she betrayed us,

08:06.167 --> 08:07.700
that she spied for Fayed.

08:07.767 --> 08:11.134
I think we're wrong.

08:11.201 --> 08:14.067
This is not easy
for any of us.

08:14.134 --> 08:15.334
But the facts
at hand indicate

08:15.401 --> 08:16.733
she was streaming intel

08:16.800 --> 08:17.833
from her station.

08:17.900 --> 08:18.833
CHLOE:
Mr. Buchanan.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.301
What is it?

08:20.367 --> 08:21.334
We may have caught a break.

08:24.034 --> 08:25.700
What do you have?

08:25.767 --> 08:27.900
I've been monitoring
everyone on our watch list

08:27.967 --> 08:29.401
who's ever communicated
with Gredenko

08:29.467 --> 08:30.501
through phone calls or e-mails.

08:30.568 --> 08:31.934
The filter algorithm

08:32.000 --> 08:33.832
flagged a call that
happened a few minutes ago.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.501
Mark Hauser.

08:35.568 --> 08:37.067
He does security consulting
for energy companies.

08:37.134 --> 08:39.000
His company has contracts

08:39.067 --> 08:40.900
with dozens of chemical
facilities-- oil fields,

08:40.967 --> 08:43.433
pipelines
and nuclear power plants.

08:43.501 --> 08:45.167
Unfortunately the call
was scrambled,

08:45.234 --> 08:47.301
but we do have Hauser's address.

08:47.367 --> 08:48.568
Get that address to Jack.

08:51.301 --> 08:52.967
You wanted to see me?

08:53.034 --> 08:56.301
Yeah, excuse us, guys.

08:56.367 --> 08:57.700
While I was stripping data

08:57.767 --> 08:59.800
from the drone pilot's
hard drive,

08:59.867 --> 09:01.134
I found this.

09:01.201 --> 09:02.900
What is it?

09:02.967 --> 09:04.601
Remote access module.

09:04.668 --> 09:06.234
It's how the drone pilot
breached CTU's satellite grid.

09:06.301 --> 09:08.201
No, the pilot
got into our system

09:08.267 --> 09:09.634
because Nadia Yassir
opened the door

09:09.700 --> 09:11.067
and let him in.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.100
No, she didn't.

09:12.167 --> 09:13.434
This guy got in through

09:13.501 --> 09:14.634
one of the radical web sites
Nadia's been monitoring.

09:14.700 --> 09:18.034
The access module proves it.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.767
Are you saying Nadia's
system was compromised

09:19.833 --> 09:21.634
and she didn't know it?
That's right.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.668
That puts you in
a tough position,

09:24.733 --> 09:25.833
considering you're the one

09:25.900 --> 09:28.201
who led the witch
hunt against her.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.501
I followed standard protocols

09:29.568 --> 09:31.833
based on the information
that was available at the time.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.733
Well, Nadia might not
see it that way

09:33.800 --> 09:36.900
when she takes it up with
the Justice Department.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.167
You know, once the
dust settles today,

09:38.234 --> 09:41.034
they might want to
make you an example.

09:44.034 --> 09:46.900
Relax, Mike.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.267
You took care of me in Denver,
and I still owe you for that.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.134
But we're even now.

09:54.201 --> 09:55.367
Copy that. I'll get back to you
as soon as we're there.

09:55.434 --> 09:57.167
We got a lead on Gredenko.

09:57.234 --> 09:58.401
How good a lead?

09:58.467 --> 09:59.434
We'll know soon enough.

09:59.501 --> 10:00.634
It's just a few
miles from here.

10:00.700 --> 10:01.700
I want you to put
together a Tac Team,

10:01.767 --> 10:02.800
we'll move out.

10:02.867 --> 10:03.833
I need to stay behind.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.201
We're still processing.

10:06.234 --> 10:07.467
Fine.

10:07.534 --> 10:10.568
Ryan, get your men together,
come with me.

10:56.234 --> 10:58.101
--Sandra?

10:58.167 --> 10:59.867
How are you holding up?

10:59.934 --> 11:02.767
I can't believe
this is happening.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.867
It doesn't feel real.

11:04.934 --> 11:07.134
I'm so sorry.

11:12.301 --> 11:14.267
Sandra.

11:15.900 --> 11:19.101
Unfortunately, I need
to ask you for your help.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.800
(sniffles)
There's an extremely

11:20.867 --> 11:23.700
volatile situation developing
at the White House.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.667
Vice President Daniels is about
to launch a nuclear strike

11:26.734 --> 11:28.500
against the Middle East.

11:28.567 --> 11:30.900
A nuclear strike?
Yes.

11:30.967 --> 11:32.468
And the cabinet is behind him.

11:32.533 --> 11:33.767
I've tried arguing against it,

11:33.834 --> 11:35.900
but no one's
listening.
Are they insane?

11:35.967 --> 11:38.167
No. They're just scared.

11:38.234 --> 11:40.401
Before the attempted

11:40.468 --> 11:42.134
assassination
on your brother,

11:42.201 --> 11:44.633
Wayne was reaching out
to the Middle East governments

11:44.700 --> 11:46.700
to solicit their help
in stopping Fayed.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.201
And it was working.

11:48.267 --> 11:51.533
This strike is a complete
reversal of everything

11:51.600 --> 11:54.001
that he was
working for.

11:54.067 --> 11:57.600
You want Dr. Welton
to bring him out of the coma.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.368
Yes.

12:01.434 --> 12:03.001
And I need your consent.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.533
But the doctor said

12:04.600 --> 12:06.667
that he needs
to remain sedated

12:06.734 --> 12:09.500
for a few days
before the swelling can subside.

12:09.567 --> 12:12.101
Yeah, but-but
we don't have a few days.

12:12.167 --> 12:14.034
Yeah, well, even
if Wayne regains consciousness,

12:14.101 --> 12:16.867
we don't know what state
he'll be in, physically

12:16.934 --> 12:19.001
or mentally.
But we won't know
unless we try.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.633
Sandra, I wouldn't dare
to ask you

12:20.700 --> 12:22.334
to risk this if
I did not think

12:22.401 --> 12:25.067
it was absolutely necessary
for the sake of our country.

12:25.134 --> 12:27.500
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

12:27.567 --> 12:28.800
(voice quivering)

12:28.867 --> 12:30.001
Sandra, please.

12:30.067 --> 12:32.468
I've already
lost one brother.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.201
I can't lose another one.

12:34.267 --> 12:36.401
I know you did not ask

12:36.468 --> 12:39.667
for this responsibility,
but like it or not, it is yours.

12:39.734 --> 12:43.234
Wayne Palmer is still
the president of our country.

12:43.301 --> 12:45.368
He's the only one who can
stop this from happening,

12:45.434 --> 12:48.401
and you are the only one
who can give him the chance

12:48.468 --> 12:49.900
to do what he believes in.

12:49.967 --> 12:52.967
(machine beeping rhythmically)

12:58.633 --> 13:02.101
(sighs heavily)

13:02.167 --> 13:04.734
(monitor beeping)

13:04.800 --> 13:07.867
Give him that chance.

13:07.934 --> 13:11.934
Ask yourself what Wayne
would want you to do.

13:12.001 --> 13:14.201
(beeping continues)

13:18.700 --> 13:21.834
I'll talk to Dr. Welton.

13:23.834 --> 13:27.034
And God forgive me if I'm wrong.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.900
The USS <i>Vickery</i>
has been detached

13:30.967 --> 13:32.234
from carrier
group Falcon,

13:32.301 --> 13:33.900
which is currently on
patrol in the region.

13:33.967 --> 13:38.034
Now, the <i>Vickery</i>
will reach launch position in

13:38.101 --> 13:39.267
40 minutes.

13:39.334 --> 13:41.401
So, in less than an hour,

13:41.468 --> 13:42.767
we'll have made
our point

13:42.834 --> 13:43.967
to the enemy?

13:44.034 --> 13:45.767
Yes, Mr. Vice
President.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.900
The B-611 short-range
tactical warhead

13:47.967 --> 13:50.134
has a blast yield
of 300 kilotons.

13:51.468 --> 13:55.101
he message will be
loud and clear.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.700
Very good, Admiral.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.667
Exemplary.

13:59.734 --> 14:02.234
Tom, give us the damage
and casualty estimates

14:02.301 --> 14:05.001
you got from COMPLAN.

14:06.034 --> 14:07.967
Tom?

14:08.034 --> 14:09.267
I'm sorry, sir.

14:09.334 --> 14:10.434
Is there a problem?

14:10.500 --> 14:11.767
No. No, no.

14:11.834 --> 14:13.134
Um,

14:13.201 --> 14:15.134
this projection is,
of course,

14:15.201 --> 14:17.067
based on theoretical models

14:17.134 --> 14:20.301
generated at our nuclear
facility in Alamogordo.

14:20.368 --> 14:21.667
COM...

14:21.734 --> 14:23.800
COMPLAN estimates
a high range

14:23.867 --> 14:25.900
of general
damage by zone,

14:25.967 --> 14:27.900
as well as multiple
casualty numbers

14:27.967 --> 14:30.434
based on various
climate models.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.434
Now, should the...
I'm sorry, Tom.

14:33.867 --> 14:36.201
I need to step out
for a minute.

14:38.368 --> 14:39.967
Carry on
with the briefing.

14:40.034 --> 14:42.134
Right. Uh, should the
enemy mount a response,

14:42.201 --> 14:45.001
the potential does exist
for the US to be drawn

14:45.067 --> 14:46.767
into a conflict in
which its troops...

14:46.834 --> 14:48.301
NOAH:
What the hell does this mean,

14:48.368 --> 14:50.368
they're taking him
out of the coma?

14:50.434 --> 14:53.034
Apparently, Sandra Palmer gave
her consent a few minutes ago.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.600
(breathing loudly)

14:55.667 --> 14:57.267
This is Karen Hayes.

14:57.334 --> 14:58.600
I don't know, sir.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.034
I only found out about this

15:00.101 --> 15:02.201
because I have a source
inside the medical bay.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.867
Put me through to Dr. Welton.

15:12.533 --> 15:13.834
Okay.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.134
I've cut the pentobarbital drip.

15:15.201 --> 15:16.334
His metabolic rate's up,

15:16.401 --> 15:18.167
and he's breathing
on his own.

15:18.234 --> 15:20.001
What about the swelling
in his brain?

15:20.067 --> 15:22.301
No sign
of intracranial hypertension,

15:22.368 --> 15:24.567
but it's still too early
to know when

15:24.633 --> 15:26.900
or even if he'll regain
consciousness.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.867
WOMAN (over speaker):
Dr. Welton, Vice President
Daniels on line one.

15:29.934 --> 15:31.368
He says it's urgent.

15:31.434 --> 15:33.500
Dr. Welton, what-what
are you going to tell him?

15:33.567 --> 15:35.633
The truth.

15:40.334 --> 15:42.667
Mr. Vice President,

15:42.734 --> 15:43.834
this is Dr. Welton.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.234
I've just been told
you're trying

15:45.301 --> 15:47.067
to rouse the president
out of his coma.

15:47.134 --> 15:48.700
That's correct, sir.

15:48.767 --> 15:51.368
I thought you induced
the coma to save the
president's life.

15:51.434 --> 15:55.167
Treating patients with
head trauma's a fluid process.

15:55.234 --> 15:57.267
Sounds to me like
you're risking the life

15:57.334 --> 15:59.101
of the president of
the United States.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.700
With careful monitoring,
we can minimize that risk.

16:01.767 --> 16:02.834
Let's cut the crap, Doctor.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.167
Sir?

16:04.234 --> 16:06.201
We both know what's going
on here, why Sandra Palmer

16:06.267 --> 16:07.434
wants her brother conscious.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.401
She's trying
to subvert my policy agenda.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.034
Policy's not my concern.
Oh, I think

16:11.101 --> 16:12.633
you're very concerned,
and I think you agree

16:12.700 --> 16:14.267
with what she's doing,
and you're willing

16:14.334 --> 16:16.368
to risk the life
of the president to get it done.

16:16.434 --> 16:20.301
So if you don't stop now,
I will compel you to stop.

16:20.368 --> 16:21.633
With all due respect, sir,

16:21.700 --> 16:23.734
the president's medical
treatment is not under...

16:23.800 --> 16:25.734
You'll do what I tell you.
No, sir.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.201
I'm sorry, I will not.

16:28.267 --> 16:31.134
I am required to
follow the wishes
of Sandra Palmer.

16:31.201 --> 16:33.700
You're free
to take up your concerns

16:33.767 --> 16:35.667
with her.

16:35.734 --> 16:37.934
If the president dies
or suffers any permanent damage

16:38.001 --> 16:40.734
from your actions, I will
nail your ass to the wall.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.468
Do you understand me?

16:42.533 --> 16:44.567
Perfectly, sir.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.733
Chloe, I need that photo.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.934
I need it now.

17:13.001 --> 17:14.401
Sending now, Jack.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.067
(beeps)

17:16.134 --> 17:18.666
Team B, advise
when you're in position.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.201
MAN (over radio):
Team B in position.

17:26.267 --> 17:27.267
Copy that.

17:27.334 --> 17:28.633
I've got a positive ID.

17:28.700 --> 17:31.201
Move in on the house now,
move in on the house now!

17:36.234 --> 17:37.767
Federal agent!

17:37.834 --> 17:38.967
Get on the floor!

17:39.034 --> 17:41.500
(two gunshots)
Mark! Mark!

17:41.567 --> 17:42.633
Don't move!
Do what they say, Brady.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.167
JACK:
Put him in a chair.

17:45.234 --> 17:46.167
(grunting)

17:46.234 --> 17:47.600
Mark, Mark.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.700
(grunting)

17:51.767 --> 17:54.667
Take him in the living room now.

17:54.734 --> 17:55.967
Let's go.
(groans)

17:56.034 --> 17:57.633
He doesn't know anything.
Shut up!

17:57.700 --> 17:58.900
Mark.

17:58.967 --> 18:00.334
He's got some
arterial bleeding.

18:00.401 --> 18:02.401
We need to get him
to a hospital.

18:02.468 --> 18:03.834
We don't have time.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.067
Do whatever you have to
to stabilize him.
All right.

18:11.267 --> 18:13.301
Let me have the room.

18:14.734 --> 18:17.734
I know you're scared right now,

18:17.800 --> 18:20.834
but everything's
going to be okay.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.500
I want to see my brother.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.334
I'm going to let you
see your brother,

18:24.401 --> 18:26.767
but I need to ask you
some questions first.

18:26.834 --> 18:28.001
I'm not allowed.

18:28.067 --> 18:30.034
You're not allowed? Why?

18:30.101 --> 18:31.900
Mark says,
don't talk to strangers.

18:31.967 --> 18:33.834
I'm not a stranger.
I'm a police officer.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.767
You can talk to me.
It's all right.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.434
My name is
Jack Bauer.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.600
What's yours?

18:38.667 --> 18:39.767
Brady.

18:39.834 --> 18:41.034
Brady.

18:41.101 --> 18:42.667
Brady, when we came in,

18:42.734 --> 18:44.067
you were working
on your computer.

18:44.134 --> 18:46.167
What were you
working on?

18:47.434 --> 18:48.867
G-Getting files.

18:48.934 --> 18:50.533
What kind of files?

18:50.600 --> 18:51.834
I don't know.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.101
Mark asked me to get
through the IPC firewall

18:54.167 --> 18:55.834
to set up a proxy server port.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.500
Oh.

18:58.567 --> 19:00.301
Can I see him now?

19:00.368 --> 19:02.633
Soon.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.368
I'm going to talk to him first,

19:04.434 --> 19:08.067
and then you can
see him, okay?

19:08.134 --> 19:10.767
You're doing great, Brady.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.401
Stay with him.

19:17.934 --> 19:19.867
You were getting paid

19:19.934 --> 19:21.867
to give Dmitri
Gredenko information.

19:21.934 --> 19:24.067
You used your brother
to get that information.

19:24.134 --> 19:25.700
Now he's in a lot
of trouble.

19:25.767 --> 19:27.600
My brother's got nothing
to do with this.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.134
That's not
what he told me.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.567
(grunts, panting)

19:30.633 --> 19:32.234
He doesn't... he doesn't
know what he's doing.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.301
That's not how the Justice
Department's going to see it.

19:34.368 --> 19:36.334
They're going to prosecute him
for treason unless I intervene.

19:36.401 --> 19:38.767
Now I'll help your brother
because you and I both know

19:38.834 --> 19:40.368
he didn't understand
what he was doing,

19:40.434 --> 19:42.167
but you're going to have
to give me Gredenko.

19:42.234 --> 19:45.334
What kind of information
were you selling him?

19:45.401 --> 19:47.301
Security specs.

19:47.368 --> 19:49.234
What security specs?

19:49.301 --> 19:51.167
The Edgemont nuclear

19:51.234 --> 19:54.234
power plant.

19:55.434 --> 19:57.334
Bill, this is
Connell Johnson.

19:57.401 --> 19:58.500
He's on loan
from District.

19:58.567 --> 19:59.600
Connell.
Hey.

19:59.667 --> 20:00.667
We swept the drone pilot's
system.

20:00.734 --> 20:02.234
Most of the hard drives
and data files

20:02.301 --> 20:04.001
are encrypted.
Our digital
forensics people

20:04.067 --> 20:05.167
are expecting you.

20:05.234 --> 20:06.633
We'll see what we can find.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.667
Have you gotten anything more
from Nadia?

20:08.734 --> 20:10.567
She still claims
she was set up.

20:10.633 --> 20:12.434
Is she in
the building?
Yeah.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.201
She's being transferred
to a holding facility.

20:14.267 --> 20:16.034
Why do you ask?
Just curious.

20:16.101 --> 20:17.334
Sir, Jack's on line two.

20:17.401 --> 20:19.368
He's got Hauser in custody.

20:25.234 --> 20:27.167
Jack?

20:27.234 --> 20:28.633
Bill, Hauser admitted to selling

20:28.700 --> 20:29.800
Gredenko the
security specs

20:29.867 --> 20:30.867
for Edgemont nuclear
power facility.

20:30.934 --> 20:32.401
Does Gredenko
have the specs?
Not yet.

20:32.468 --> 20:34.334
He's going to pick them
up in about 20 minutes.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.834
Can your team
handle the grab?

20:35.900 --> 20:37.334
We've got a situation.

20:37.401 --> 20:39.967
Hauser was wounded, but he's got
a brother that Gredenko knows.

20:40.034 --> 20:42.500
We're going to use him to go
through with the transaction.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.600
Right now,
it's the best shot we've got

20:44.667 --> 20:46.067
of getting Gredenko alive.

21:05.001 --> 21:08.133
--Brady, we need to talk.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.133
Are you really a-a policeman?

21:11.200 --> 21:13.034
Yeah.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.200
Then...

21:14.267 --> 21:16.701
my brother did something wrong.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.200
He's made some mistakes,

21:18.267 --> 21:20.801
but he's helping us fix them.

21:20.867 --> 21:21.968
Everyone makes mistakes.

21:22.034 --> 21:23.334
I make mistakes all the time.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.334
And you try and fix them, right?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.167
Yeah.

21:27.233 --> 21:29.534
That's what your brother's
trying to do,

21:29.601 --> 21:30.701
but he needs your help.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.400
Why don't we go
talk to him?

21:32.467 --> 21:33.601
Okay.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.200
Come on, let's go.

21:37.901 --> 21:39.734
Mark? <i>Mark?!</i>

21:39.801 --> 21:41.367
It's okay, Brady.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.667
It's okay.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.734
It's not as bad as it looks.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.867
They're taking me
to the hospital.

21:47.934 --> 21:49.701
I want to go
with you, Mark.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.100
You need to stay

21:51.167 --> 21:53.068
with them.
Don't leave me alone,
Mark, please.

21:53.133 --> 21:54.801
Listen to me, Brady.

21:54.867 --> 21:57.367
Listen.

21:57.434 --> 21:59.068
You need to do

21:59.133 --> 22:00.701
whatever this man
tells you to do.

22:04.233 --> 22:06.934
You'll be fine.

22:07.001 --> 22:09.034
Who takes care
of you, Brady?

22:09.100 --> 22:11.901
Y-You do, Mark.

22:11.968 --> 22:14.467
That's right.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.100
So you need to trust me

22:16.167 --> 22:18.901
when I tell you
you'll be fine.

22:20.968 --> 22:23.167
He'll take care of you.

22:24.233 --> 22:27.133
Okay?

22:27.200 --> 22:29.068
O-Okay.

22:33.267 --> 22:35.133
Let's make the call.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.100
(cell phone ringing)

22:46.467 --> 22:47.434
Yes.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.867
It's Hauser.

22:48.934 --> 22:51.534
I have the security protocols,
but there's a problem.

22:51.601 --> 22:53.100
What problem?

22:53.167 --> 22:55.100
My supervisor
wants me to come in.

22:55.167 --> 22:57.001
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

22:57.068 --> 22:59.167
He wants me at the office now.

22:59.233 --> 23:02.434
If I'm not there
in ten minutes,

23:02.500 --> 23:03.767
the protocols
will default,

23:03.834 --> 23:05.834
and I'll have to download
them all over again.

23:05.901 --> 23:07.834
I need those protocols.

23:09.001 --> 23:10.667
I can leave them
with my brother.

23:10.734 --> 23:12.801
Brady?

23:12.867 --> 23:14.068
Unless you want to wait

23:14.133 --> 23:16.267
for me to get back
from the office.

23:16.334 --> 23:19.300
I don't have time.

23:19.367 --> 23:21.233
Have your brother meet
me in the parking lot

23:21.300 --> 23:22.934
across the street.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.801
He'll be there.

23:26.867 --> 23:29.001
Good-bye.

23:29.068 --> 23:31.434
The parking lot.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.534
Across the street.
20 minutes.

23:32.601 --> 23:34.167
He needs to get
to a hospital now.

23:34.233 --> 23:35.601
Take him.

23:35.667 --> 23:38.034
BRADY:
Mark!

23:38.100 --> 23:39.400
Mark!

23:39.467 --> 23:41.267
Brady, it's all right.

23:41.334 --> 23:43.801
It's all right. We're going
to take care of him, I promise.

23:43.867 --> 23:47.300
Right now, I need you to
listen to me very carefully,

23:47.367 --> 23:49.267
just like your
brother told you to.

23:49.334 --> 23:50.400
Okay?

23:50.467 --> 23:52.367
O-Okay.

24:03.567 --> 24:04.500
Milo Pressman?

24:04.567 --> 24:05.767
Yeah.

24:05.834 --> 24:06.968
Connell Johnson.

24:07.034 --> 24:08.133
I'm on loan from District.
Data forensics.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.167
Yeah, I think
we crossed paths in Denver.

24:10.233 --> 24:11.467
That's right,
we did.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.734
What can I do for you?

24:12.801 --> 24:16.867
Well, I hear you
and Nadia Yassir are friends.

24:16.934 --> 24:18.934
Yeah. Why do you ask?

24:19.001 --> 24:21.233
Because I came across evidence
at the switching station

24:21.300 --> 24:24.267
that proves
Nadia's innocent.

24:24.334 --> 24:25.300
Explain.

24:25.367 --> 24:27.601
She wasn't streaming intel.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.100
Her system was breached.

24:29.167 --> 24:31.801
Where is this evidence?

24:31.867 --> 24:33.267
Ask Doyle.

24:33.334 --> 24:34.300
Doyle?

24:34.367 --> 24:35.634
I hate to be
a platoon rat,

24:35.701 --> 24:37.867
but I don't know
where else to go.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.200
I gave him the evidence

24:39.267 --> 24:40.701
at the crime scene, and he
still hasn't logged it in.

24:40.767 --> 24:41.834
Thank you.

24:41.901 --> 24:42.901
BUCHANAN:
Make sure Jack's team

24:42.968 --> 24:44.133
has a full
surveillance package

24:44.200 --> 24:45.567
with infrared
capability.

24:45.634 --> 24:48.467
Why'd you do it,
you son of a bitch?
Are you crazy?!

24:48.534 --> 24:49.934
BUCHANAN:
Milo, hat's enough!
Tell him! Tell...

24:50.001 --> 24:52.767
He's got evidence
that Nadia's innocent!

24:52.834 --> 24:53.567
Is this true?

24:53.634 --> 24:55.267
Yeah.

24:55.334 --> 24:56.867
And he buried it
to save his own ass.

24:56.934 --> 24:59.467
He didn't bury it.
Milo. He didn't bury it.

24:59.534 --> 25:03.300
It's a remote access module
that breached Nadia's computer.

25:03.367 --> 25:05.767
He gave it to me
ten minutes ago.

25:05.834 --> 25:07.567
Why didn't you tell us
about this?

25:07.634 --> 25:09.667
Because I got it
from an unreliable source.

25:09.734 --> 25:11.300
I wanted to make sure
it was real

25:11.367 --> 25:13.300
before I submitted it
for evidence.

25:13.367 --> 25:14.801
I ran a verification scan.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.734
It's definitely real, and
Nadia is definitely innocent.

25:16.801 --> 25:18.734
I'll review the evidence.

25:18.801 --> 25:20.400
If it's true,
I'll release Nadia.

25:21.567 --> 25:24.467
In the meantime,
go back to work!

25:24.534 --> 25:26.500
Come with me, Morris.

25:32.233 --> 25:33.500
Doyle...

25:36.867 --> 25:37.834
I owe you an apology.

25:37.901 --> 25:40.100
It's not your fault.

25:40.167 --> 25:41.467
Still.

25:41.534 --> 25:43.500
Milo, forget about it.

25:47.901 --> 25:49.534
Johnson.

25:52.567 --> 25:55.300
You have screwed
with the wrong guy

26:17.668 --> 26:19.134
--Uncuff her.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.934
(handcuffs clicking)

26:27.601 --> 26:29.568
(handcuffs hit floor)

26:31.800 --> 26:33.568
Excuse us, please.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.800
We found evidence
at the switching station.

26:43.634 --> 26:46.634
It proves your computer was
breached from an outside source.

26:48.668 --> 26:50.767
You're cleared, Nadia.

26:53.833 --> 26:55.434
I'm sorry this happened.

26:57.501 --> 27:00.501
So am I.

27:00.568 --> 27:04.601
Your first impulse
will be to quit,

27:04.668 --> 27:07.668
take legal action.

27:07.733 --> 27:09.934
I don't blame you.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.201
That's what I'd do.

27:13.267 --> 27:17.000
But I'm asking
you to stay.

27:17.067 --> 27:18.867
This crisis is
far from over.

27:18.934 --> 27:22.134
We can't afford to
lose our best people.

27:22.201 --> 27:24.934
We need you, Nadia.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.534
I'll stay.

27:36.034 --> 27:38.867
Milo's setting up
your workstation now.

27:42.833 --> 27:43.800
(knocking)

27:45.034 --> 27:46.800
I just sent over
the assault vectors.

27:46.867 --> 27:48.167
Nadia should
be good to go.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.733
Thank you.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.067
We all thought
she was guilty.

27:51.134 --> 27:52.401
This is going
to be awkward.

27:52.467 --> 27:54.134
Yeah.

27:54.201 --> 27:55.534
Especially for you.

27:57.601 --> 27:58.568
Why especially for me?

28:00.634 --> 28:03.167
Your feelings for Nadia
aren't exactly a big secret.

28:03.234 --> 28:05.733
Thank you for pointing that out.

28:25.367 --> 28:27.700
Your station's all set.

28:27.767 --> 28:30.167
Comm's up.

28:30.234 --> 28:32.034
You'll have full
security access to the subnet.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.067
Thanks.

28:34.134 --> 28:36.234
Listen, Nadia,

28:36.301 --> 28:37.601
I just...
Look, Milo,

28:37.668 --> 28:39.668
I don't have time for a
heart-to-heart right now, okay?

28:39.733 --> 28:41.900
I got a lot of catching
up to do. Excuse me.

28:41.967 --> 28:43.401
I understand that.

28:43.467 --> 28:44.867
Nadia, wait.

28:44.934 --> 28:47.234
Damn it! You're not going to
make this easy for me, are you?

28:47.301 --> 28:50.034
You know what?
Actually, I am.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.467
Whatever you thought
might happen between us,

28:51.534 --> 28:52.800
you can just
forget it.

28:52.867 --> 28:54.334
That's not fair.
Milo, believe
it or not,

28:54.401 --> 28:56.434
I don't even blame you
for suspecting me.

28:56.501 --> 28:57.967
But you have
to admit,

28:58.034 --> 28:59.900
this is not the best place
to start a relationship.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.668
You're probably right.

29:34.534 --> 29:38.767
But I still wanted to say
I'm sorry.

29:43.301 --> 29:45.267
You said it.

29:50.334 --> 29:51.900
I should get to work.

29:58.534 --> 30:01.501
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:06.568 --> 30:07.601
Here.

30:07.668 --> 30:08.668
Thanks.

30:08.733 --> 30:10.934
We haven't heard
from Dr. Welton,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.201
and he's been giving us
regular updates.

30:13.267 --> 30:14.767
Well, I'm sure if there was
something to report,

30:14.833 --> 30:15.800
we would have heard from him.

30:15.867 --> 30:17.767
Oh, gosh.

30:17.833 --> 30:19.967
I've never been good
at waiting for anything.

30:20.034 --> 30:22.833
David had the
patience of Job.

30:22.900 --> 30:25.201
But not me.

30:25.267 --> 30:27.301
Wayne is always
somewhere in between.

30:32.568 --> 30:35.167
We have a decision to make.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.700
What is it?

30:37.767 --> 30:39.334
There's an increase
in intracranial swelling.

30:39.401 --> 30:41.134
How serious is it?

30:41.201 --> 30:43.601
It's not life-threatening yet,
but if it continues,

30:43.668 --> 30:45.234
it could cause
permanent brain damage.

30:46.900 --> 30:47.967
I suggest
we re-induce the coma.

30:50.334 --> 30:51.733
No.

30:53.934 --> 30:56.733
Sandra,
you understand the danger?

30:56.800 --> 30:58.833
Yeah, but there's
a chance he'd be okay.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.867
Yes, there's a chance.

31:00.934 --> 31:03.601
Well, even if
it's a small chance

31:03.668 --> 31:04.833
for Wayne to stop Daniels,

31:04.900 --> 31:08.201
then it's worth
the risk.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.234
I know Wayne would
want to see this through.

31:10.301 --> 31:12.401
Dr. Welton?

31:12.467 --> 31:13.934
You need to come quickly.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.967
(monitor beeping rapidly)

31:16.034 --> 31:17.434
He's crashing.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.201
Get a code team
in here right away.

31:19.267 --> 31:20.301
Wait outside!

31:20.367 --> 31:21.568
NURSE:
Code team to One!

31:21.634 --> 31:22.668
Code team to One, stat!

31:41.534 --> 31:43.867
Teams are in position.

31:43.934 --> 31:45.434
You sure he
can do this?

31:45.501 --> 31:47.401
He just needs to get Gredenko
out of his car.

31:50.134 --> 31:52.900
We don't have
another option.

31:52.967 --> 31:55.100
Just tell Charlie team
they've got one shot at this.

32:00.601 --> 32:02.401
Damn it.

32:05.634 --> 32:07.867
Brady, I need you
to wear one of these.

32:07.934 --> 32:09.534
So we can talk to each other.

32:09.601 --> 32:12.534
This way, you'll be able to
hear me, and I can hear you.

32:12.601 --> 32:14.167
I need to put
it in your ear.

32:14.234 --> 32:15.234
Will, uh, it hurt?

32:15.301 --> 32:17.234
No.

32:17.301 --> 32:18.467
No, I promise.

32:21.534 --> 32:23.100
See?

32:23.167 --> 32:25.334
Now, I'm going to
talk you through this.

32:25.401 --> 32:29.034
But we don't want Mr. Gredenko
to know that you can hear me.

32:29.100 --> 32:31.867
So we have to pretend
that you can't.

32:31.934 --> 32:32.900
You understand?

32:32.967 --> 32:34.867
Yeah.

32:34.934 --> 32:36.267
Good.

32:36.334 --> 32:37.934
You're going to give him this.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.167
He's going to meet you in the
parking lot across the street.

32:41.234 --> 32:43.100
I want you to stand
on the sidewalk.

32:43.167 --> 32:45.867
That's your
position.

32:45.934 --> 32:46.900
Okay.

32:46.967 --> 32:49.034
We're set.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.668
We should go now.

33:07.267 --> 33:08.833
You don't need
to be scared, Brady.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.201
Everything's going to be fine.

33:10.267 --> 33:12.434
I'm going to be able
to watch you the whole time,

33:12.501 --> 33:14.501
and I'm going to be able to
hear everything that you say.

33:14.568 --> 33:16.501
Now, I need you to go
to your position.

33:16.568 --> 33:18.934
You remember the position
we talked about?
Yeah.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.501
I'm going to go
to my position.
Okay.

33:31.467 --> 33:33.334
All teams, report in.

33:33.401 --> 33:34.434
Alpha team,
in position.

33:34.501 --> 33:35.733
Bravo team,
in position.

33:35.800 --> 33:36.867
Charlie team,
in position.

33:36.934 --> 33:38.900
Charlie team, you
are responsible

33:38.967 --> 33:41.467
for taking out Gredenko
with the tranquilizer dart.

33:41.534 --> 33:44.800
Teams A and B, I want you 
to acquire remaining targets.

33:44.867 --> 33:47.401
Do whatever you have to,
to protect this kid.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.568
Brady, it's Jack.
Can you hear me?

33:55.634 --> 33:56.700
I hear you.

33:56.767 --> 33:58.034
You're doing great.

33:58.100 --> 34:00.000
When can I see
my brother?

34:00.067 --> 34:02.334
As soon as this is
over, I promise.

34:02.401 --> 34:03.800
Okay.

34:03.867 --> 34:06.867
Okay, good.

34:15.266 --> 34:17.367
I have a visual on
Gredenko's SUV.

34:17.434 --> 34:18.534
Windows are tinted.

34:18.601 --> 34:20.201
I can't see
who's inside.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.201
Brady?

34:22.266 --> 34:24.400
Do you see the car
that's coming towards you?
Yeah.

34:24.467 --> 34:25.766
It's time to get ready.

34:37.266 --> 34:38.733
I got a visual
on Gredenko.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.967
Charlie team, take your shot
as soon as you've got one.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.034
Copy that.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.234
Do you have it?

34:43.301 --> 34:45.266
Yeah.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.766
Give it to me.

34:48.867 --> 34:50.434
I have a negative line
of sight.

34:50.501 --> 34:52.766
Hauser's in the way.

35:08.568 --> 35:11.467
You look nervous, Brady.

35:14.467 --> 35:16.100
Why are you so nervous?

35:18.201 --> 35:21.234
(speaking Russian)

35:21.301 --> 35:22.900
Gredenko just gave the order
to shoot the kid

35:22.967 --> 35:25.067
as soon as the
information's
been verified.

35:25.134 --> 35:26.767
Charlie team, do you
have your shot yet?
Negative.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.634
Hauser's still
in the way.
Can you move
position?

35:28.700 --> 35:29.800
Negative.

35:29.867 --> 35:31.700
Brady.

35:31.767 --> 35:33.700
Don't forget to pretend
like you can't hear me.

35:33.767 --> 35:35.401
You're doing great.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.434
I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

35:37.501 --> 35:40.134
When I tell you, I want you
to go down to the ground

35:40.201 --> 35:41.367
and stay there.

35:41.434 --> 35:43.401
Wait till I tell you.

35:50.100 --> 35:52.034
(speaking Russian)

35:52.100 --> 35:54.467
(speaking Russian)

35:54.534 --> 35:55.668
Brady, get down on the ground.

35:57.733 --> 36:00.267
Brady, get down on the ground!

36:01.733 --> 36:03.034
All teams,
take out your targets.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.534
(gunshots)

36:04.601 --> 36:08.301
All teams, there's a third
hostile inside the vehicle!

36:14.134 --> 36:16.167
Brady.

36:16.234 --> 36:17.534
Brady, are you okay?

36:17.601 --> 36:18.700
It's over.

36:18.767 --> 36:20.301
It's over.
You did great.

36:20.367 --> 36:21.733
I want to see my brother.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.034
Okay.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.934
You can see your brother
just like I promised.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.867
Get Gredenko back
in the house.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.501
Prep him.
Contact CTU.

36:28.568 --> 36:30.201
Advise Buchanan that we've
got Gredenko in custody

36:30.267 --> 36:31.668
and we're prepping him
for interrogation.

36:50.534 --> 36:52.501
--Watch your head.

36:53.534 --> 36:55.033
Brady,

36:55.100 --> 36:57.434
this man's going
to look after you.

36:57.501 --> 36:58.901
He's going to take you
to see your brother.

36:58.968 --> 37:00.100
I want to see my brother.

37:00.167 --> 37:01.801
Yeah.

37:01.868 --> 37:03.434
You did great.

37:03.501 --> 37:04.634
Thank you.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.734
Okay.

37:08.801 --> 37:10.767
(engine starts)

37:25.267 --> 37:27.234
We searched
Gredenko's vehicle

37:27.300 --> 37:28.400
and the surrounding area.

37:28.467 --> 37:29.634
There's no sign
of the bombs.

37:29.701 --> 37:30.734
Is he conscious yet?
Yes.

37:30.801 --> 37:32.067
You want help with him?

37:32.133 --> 37:34.968
No.

37:35.033 --> 37:37.033
(coughing)

37:48.334 --> 37:50.767
You know who I am?

37:50.834 --> 37:54.167
I know all about you,
Agent Bauer.

37:54.234 --> 37:57.133
Then you know
what I'm going to do to you

37:57.200 --> 38:00.167
unless you tell me
where the bombs are.

38:00.234 --> 38:03.100
And when I'm finished,
I'm going to put you

38:03.167 --> 38:05.567
on the fastest plane
we've got back to Russia.

38:05.634 --> 38:07.868
I don't think
President Suvarov's

38:07.934 --> 38:10.100
going to be
too happy to see you.

38:10.167 --> 38:12.133
Fayed has the bombs.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.501
Where is he?

38:13.567 --> 38:14.834
I don't know.

38:14.901 --> 38:17.334
But I can help you find him.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.767
I'm listening.

38:21.834 --> 38:23.701
(coughs)

38:23.767 --> 38:29.934
I came here to get security
specs for the Edgemont

38:30.000 --> 38:31.501
nuclear power plant.

38:31.567 --> 38:32.834
That's your next target.

38:32.901 --> 38:34.300
Yes.

38:34.367 --> 38:37.167
Fayed's waiting for my call.

38:38.234 --> 38:40.734
Make the call.

38:40.801 --> 38:43.334
No.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.200
First, my terms.

38:48.033 --> 38:49.801
Amnesty from your government.

38:49.868 --> 38:52.968
And a guarantee
I won't be returned to Russia.

38:54.033 --> 38:56.400
What?

38:56.467 --> 38:59.701
I'm offering you Fayed.

38:59.767 --> 39:01.734
What's the problem?

39:02.801 --> 39:05.000
I'm not martyr.

39:05.067 --> 39:06.868
I'm soldier.

39:06.934 --> 39:09.033
And realist.

39:11.267 --> 39:13.968
If I don't call him soon,

39:14.033 --> 39:16.300
Fayed will get suspicious.

39:23.467 --> 39:25.667
Admiral Smith,
is the <i>Vickery</i> ready to launch?

39:25.734 --> 39:27.934
It's seconds from optimal
launch position,

39:28.000 --> 39:29.200
Mr. Vice President.
Good.

39:29.267 --> 39:30.100
Mr. Vice President.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.167
Yes, Tom?

39:31.234 --> 39:32.667
Just spoke to Bill Buchanan
at CTU.

39:32.734 --> 39:34.367
They've taken Gredenko
into custody.

39:34.434 --> 39:36.634
Jack Bauer is
questioning him now.

39:36.701 --> 39:38.067
Does Bill think there's a chance

39:38.133 --> 39:39.701
this could lead
to something?
Well, he's confident

39:39.767 --> 39:41.501
that Bauer's the man
for the interrogation,

39:41.567 --> 39:43.601
and he's hoping they get
the answers they need.

39:43.667 --> 39:46.801
I hope his confidence
is justified.

39:46.868 --> 39:49.834
Sir, the <i>Vickery's</i> in position.

39:49.901 --> 39:51.200
They're standing by.

39:51.267 --> 39:52.567
Proceed with the strike.

39:52.634 --> 39:54.033
Yes, Mr. Vice
President.
Mr. Vice President,

39:54.100 --> 39:55.133
if I may.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.868
In light of
the developments

39:56.934 --> 40:00.067
at CTU, do we not want
to delay this launch

40:00.133 --> 40:01.968
and just see what Bauer
gets out of Gredenko?

40:02.033 --> 40:03.667
I'm not going
to delay our response

40:03.734 --> 40:05.701
based on what Gredenko
may or may not reveal.

40:05.767 --> 40:07.801
But if Gredenko
gives up the bombs,

40:07.868 --> 40:09.801
then surely that is
the desired result...

40:09.868 --> 40:12.534
Then we can consider
this strike as retaliation

40:12.601 --> 40:13.634
for American lives
already lost!

40:13.701 --> 40:14.901
A reminder to the world

40:14.968 --> 40:17.300
there are consequences
to attacking our country.

40:19.601 --> 40:22.901
Admiral Smith...

40:22.968 --> 40:24.033
proceed with the launch.

40:24.100 --> 40:26.067
Yes, Mr. Vice President.

40:40.434 --> 40:41.834
Sir,

40:41.901 --> 40:43.767
the <i>Vickery</i> just received

40:43.834 --> 40:45.901
a message
over the COMPLAN subnet.

40:45.968 --> 40:48.634
They've been ordered
to stand down.

40:48.701 --> 40:51.167
What the hell
are you talking about?

40:51.234 --> 40:52.501
Who gave this order?

40:52.567 --> 40:53.801
President Palmer, sir.

40:55.367 --> 40:56.901
President Palmer?

40:56.968 --> 40:59.567
(phone rings)

40:59.634 --> 41:01.601
Conference Room,

41:01.667 --> 41:03.701
Lisa Miller.

41:05.868 --> 41:07.801
One moment.

41:07.868 --> 41:10.434
It's for you, sir.

41:13.467 --> 41:14.634
Yes.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.300
Noah... it's Wayne.

41:19.367 --> 41:21.701
Mr. President.

41:23.767 --> 41:26.501
It is an incredible relief
to hear your voice.

41:27.701 --> 41:29.534
To be frank,
it's a surprise.

41:29.601 --> 41:32.000
I've called off the strike,
Noah.

41:32.067 --> 41:34.300
We just received word.

41:34.367 --> 41:40.501
Sir, this action is a product
of careful deliberation

41:40.567 --> 41:43.000
between myself
and the Joint Chiefs.

41:43.067 --> 41:45.000
Yeah, well, be that as it may,

41:45.067 --> 41:48.801
the decision is mine
and mine alone.

41:50.367 --> 41:53.100
I'm resuming my duties
as Commander in Chief.

41:53.167 --> 41:55.667
Inform Admiral Smith

41:55.734 --> 41:58.701
and the others, there's to be
no hostile action without

41:58.767 --> 42:00.734
my direct authorization.

42:02.267 --> 42:04.234
Is that understood?

42:04.300 --> 42:07.501
Understood, Mr. President.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.534
Good.

42:12.567 --> 42:15.534
(breathing heavily)

42:18.834 --> 42:20.801
(clears throat)

42:22.334 --> 42:25.667
It's apparent to me that...

42:25.734 --> 42:29.267
the President is still
suffering the effects

42:29.334 --> 42:30.734
from the attack
on his life.

42:30.801 --> 42:35.200
He's not thinking clearly,

42:35.267 --> 42:39.567
and in my judgment,

42:39.634 --> 42:42.033
he's not capable
of discharging his duties.

42:44.534 --> 42:46.100
I can't let him remain in power.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.734
Get me the Attorney General.
