Be nice.

17:50.506 --> 17:52.939
Up here, this is the bow
of the boat,

17:53.409 --> 17:54.708
anchor's over there,

17:54.910 --> 17:57.544
plenty of room to lay out
and work on your tan.

17:59.515 --> 18:00.580
Hop up.

18:01.617 --> 18:02.660
Thank you.

18:02.684 --> 18:03.750
Come over here.

18:04.887 --> 18:06.731
This is the portside of the boat

18:06.755 --> 18:09.734
and that's the starboard.
Port is the left.

18:09.758 --> 18:10.802
Okay.

18:15.898 --> 18:17.442
In here is our salon.

18:17.466 --> 18:19.177
Basically it's your living room.

18:19.201 --> 18:21.546
That the helm station,
nice views, huh?

18:21.570 --> 18:23.014
Yeah, it's beautiful.

18:23.038 --> 18:24.749
Yeah, yeah, close that door,

18:24.773 --> 18:26.584
you sure you don't need help
with the bag?

18:26.608 --> 18:27.719
No, I got the bag.

18:27.743 --> 18:29.703
Follow me. Come down here
and let me help you Viv.

18:29.727 --> 18:31.710
- Thank you.
- Watch your step.

18:34.750 --> 18:38.196
Here we have the galley,
that's the pantry.

18:38.220 --> 18:40.854
It's stocked with beans, rice,
et cetera. Booze.

18:41.089 --> 18:43.701
Oh, yeah. In there,
we've got proteins, meats,

18:43.725 --> 18:45.069
but we'll probably
fish for dinner.

18:45.093 --> 18:46.805
- You guys like seafood, right?
- Yeah, I love it.

18:46.829 --> 18:48.706
All right. And if you
will follow me down here,

18:48.730 --> 18:49.896
this is the cabin.

18:56.472 --> 18:58.917
All right. Now, normally
this is the captain's quarters,

18:58.941 --> 19:00.852
but this weekend it's yours.

19:00.876 --> 19:02.020
No, you don't have to do that.

19:02.044 --> 19:03.655
We can sleep in one
of the other cabins.

19:03.679 --> 19:04.923
You two are my guests.

19:04.947 --> 19:06.858
No, no, no, you take the master,

19:06.882 --> 19:08.960
we'll take one of
the smaller rooms. It's cool.

19:08.984 --> 19:10.750
There's two of you
and one of me,

19:10.986 --> 19:12.586
I'll take the cabin crew.

Let's finish the tour.

19:25.868 --> 19:28.768
Oh, we've got our fishing poles
and life jackets in here.

19:29.238 --> 19:32.250
And, uh, at the aft of the boat
we got our zodiac,

19:32.274 --> 19:34.007
in case we run into any trouble.

19:34.610 --> 19:36.054
- What kind of trouble?
- [JOHN] You know,

19:36.078 --> 19:38.523
if we have to take the zodiac in
to one of the islands

19:38.547 --> 19:40.981
- for supplies.
- Supplies means beer.

19:42.918 --> 19:44.028
You guys ready?

19:44.052 --> 19:45.052
Yeah.

19:45.821 --> 19:47.131
Yeah, yeah, let's do this.

19:47.155 --> 19:49.189
All right, Coop,
you've got the bow line.

19:49.525 --> 19:51.035
It's a forward quarter line.

And the midship line too.

21:28.824 --> 21:29.956
What's that?

21:32.127 --> 21:34.694
Out here all alone.

21:35.897 --> 21:36.897
Right.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.333
Where's Coop?

21:41.103 --> 21:42.636
Manning the wheel.

21:42.804 --> 21:44.949
- You let him drive.
- Why wouldn't I?

21:44.973 --> 21:47.007
Because we have no idea
where we are.

that way.

21:53.982 --> 21:55.827
we'll see it
in about 15 minutes.

21:55.851 --> 21:57.729
- Ah.
- We can drop anchor

21:57.753 --> 22:00.053
and party there for the night.
How does that sound?

22:29.751 --> 22:32.897
[VIVIAN] Oh, that was so good.
Thank you. That was delicious.

Woah. My bad, my bad, my bad.
Uh, you need another beer?

22:36.792 --> 22:39.203
Yeah. And could you get me
some paper towels.

22:39.227 --> 22:40.860
Here here's a towel.

22:49.971 --> 22:51.805
- Do you want more?
- Mm-hmm.

22:52.407 --> 22:54.752
There's plenty more below
in my room,

22:54.776 --> 22:57.288
so have as much as you want.

22:57.312 --> 22:58.722
Mmm, thank you.

by tomorrow,

you guys had a poker night?

23:13.061 --> 23:14.555
What do you say?

23:14.579 --> 23:16.074
- [VIVIAN] I'm game.
- [COOPER] You realize

23:16.098 --> 23:18.259
that everything I know
about poker,

23:18.283 --> 23:20.445
I learned from Danny. So yeah,
I'm down to kick your ass.

23:20.469 --> 23:23.414
Well, if Danny boy taught you,
I am upping the ante,

23:23.438 --> 23:26.951
because he was a terrible
bluffer, pitiful actually.

at the hospital?

Uh, nothing new.
Same old, same old.

23:38.453 --> 23:39.497
Nothing exciting.

Really? Come on, nothing new?
There has to be something.

23:43.058 --> 23:47.905

uh, I am seeing someone.

Really? That's great!

23:49.431 --> 23:53.299
Well, it's new.
She's, uh... she's a resident.

- Oh, well that's not surprising.
- [VIVIAN] Hmmm.

23:56.505 --> 24:00.151
That's a little young for you,
isn't it, doctor?

24:00.175 --> 24:02.442
Let me guess,
she's a brunette.

24:03.445 --> 24:04.922
Oh, how did I guess?

24:04.946 --> 24:06.958
- [VIVIAN TITTERS]
- She is. She is a brunette,

24:06.982 --> 24:09.026
and I guess some things
don't change.

Back in my hell-raising days,

we would walk into a bar.

- Every single bar.
- Every bar. [CHUCKLES]

24:20.862 --> 24:24.308
And within 15 seconds,
Danny would pick out the girl.

24:24.332 --> 24:28.301
And if Danny was interested,
then John didn't stand a chance.

to know about everything man.

how to hotwire cars,

25:04.572 --> 25:05.550
he would take him for joyrides
for hours.

that was like one time.

30:55.323 --> 30:56.489
Can you forgive me?

30:57.525 --> 31:00.693
All right?
Tell you what. Tomorrow,

31:01.396 --> 31:02.962
we can do whatever you want.

31:03.965 --> 31:05.331
All right?

31:17.912 --> 31:19.345
I need some rum.

31:20.415 --> 31:24.361
Um, we have tequila
and vodka and...

31:24.385 --> 31:26.664
Strictly a rum girl. Strictly.

31:26.688 --> 31:29.488
I got a whole case in my...
In my cabin. I'll go get it.

31:29.824 --> 31:32.425
Easy, captain, I can get it.
I'm a big girl.

31:33.494 --> 31:34.727
Just bring two bottles.

31:34.996 --> 31:36.262
[VIVIAN] Aye, aye.

31:51.613 --> 31:55.281
You know, her tits are real.
Sam.

31:55.984 --> 31:59.852
I mean, none of that fake shit.
And they're awesome.

32:00.955 --> 32:05.558
Both of them. Just saying.

32:43.564 --> 32:44.674
You know, I, um...

32:44.698 --> 32:45.809
Sorry for asking
about what happened over there.

32:45.833 --> 32:46.833
It's just,

32:47.969 --> 32:49.802
I saw what it did
to your brother.

32:50.505 --> 32:52.338
He bottled it up inside.

32:54.542 --> 32:57.910
You remind me a lot
of how he was when he came back.

32:59.380 --> 33:02.481
I'd hate to see anything happen
to my best friend's kid brother.

33:03.051 --> 33:04.817
I'm not a kid anymore.

33:05.953 --> 33:09.322
I know that.
It's just, you are different.

33:10.792 --> 33:11.957
I'm different.

33:12.727 --> 33:16.329
You mean to say
that war changes people?

33:20.535 --> 33:21.975
Maybe you're the one
who's different.

33:22.904 --> 33:24.615
Maybe we are all
a little different.

33:24.639 --> 33:28.908
You know, more grey,
more wrinkles.

33:29.110 --> 33:31.644
- More loose marbles.
- Mmm.

33:34.882 --> 33:36.916
I'm sorry
for coming at you earlier.

33:37.618 --> 33:39.063
I probably should have
just thanked you

33:39.087 --> 33:43.400
for watching over her
when I was gone, but you just...

33:43.424 --> 33:46.359
No, you don't need to thank me.

33:47.595 --> 33:48.894
You guys are family.

33:49.564 --> 33:52.031
Danny was the only flesh
and blood I had left.

33:53.568 --> 33:54.945
Viv is everything,
and I don't know

33:54.969 --> 33:56.802
what she would have done
without you.

33:58.106 --> 34:00.106
She is a tough chick,
she would have managed.

34:00.875 --> 34:02.375
Yeah, she is.

34:06.447 --> 34:08.047
Well, cheers to that.

34:12.387 --> 34:13.697
What are you guys toasting?

34:13.721 --> 34:15.821
To you. And John.

34:16.791 --> 34:18.424
Oh... Why is that?

34:18.693 --> 34:22.572
- Because we're fucking awesome?
- Right.

34:22.597 --> 34:24.496
[JOHN] Did you find
what you were looking for?

34:29.070 --> 34:30.114
The rum.

34:30.138 --> 34:33.572
Oh, yeah. Um, I'm really tired
all of a sudden.

34:33.808 --> 34:35.507
Coop, do you want to go to bed?

34:37.110 --> 34:38.177
Goodnight.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.492
Looks like someone's
looking for a trip

34:41.516 --> 34:43.494
to the Mini Coop dealership.

34:43.518 --> 34:45.795
I want to hear more
about Sam tomorrow.

34:45.820 --> 34:47.953
- [BOTH CHUCKLE]
- Goodnight.

35:52.687 --> 35:54.653
Wait, what's wrong?

35:57.959 --> 35:59.158
Just come here.

36:01.896 --> 36:03.195
It's okay, it's all right.

36:05.099 --> 36:06.532
It's all right.

36:06.734 --> 36:09.112
[SIGHS] When is not
fucking all right?

36:09.136 --> 36:10.236
It's just...

36:10.838 --> 36:11.904
I'm sorry.

36:12.206 --> 36:15.007
It's not a problem. Okay?

36:31.526 --> 36:32.569
[CHUCKLES]

36:32.593 --> 36:34.894
- I'm not done with you.
- Oh, what?

36:35.129 --> 36:37.530
Just because I can't
doesn't mean that you can't.

36:37.865 --> 36:41.667
- Come here.
- [LAUGHING] Oh, no, no.

36:43.938 --> 36:47.006
[MOANING]

37:07.128 --> 37:08.961
Why do you still wear these?

37:09.630 --> 37:10.963
They're my dog tags.

37:11.632 --> 37:12.843
No.

37:12.867 --> 37:15.846
They're a reminder
of all the shit you went through

37:15.870 --> 37:17.069
on Anchor.

37:17.738 --> 37:19.149
A leash wrapped around your neck

37:19.173 --> 37:21.073
that won't let you come home
to me.

37:23.945 --> 37:25.110
I am home.

37:25.580 --> 37:26.645
Are you?

37:29.750 --> 37:30.816
Goodnight.

37:51.138 --> 37:52.204
Morning.

37:52.840 --> 37:53.906
Morning.

37:54.875 --> 37:56.008
How did you sleep?

37:56.944 --> 37:58.010
Good.

37:58.813 --> 37:59.878

39:41.215 --> 39:43.226
[JOHN] Are you going to join
your wife and I

39:43.250 --> 39:44.750
for a little swim in the ocean?

39:46.220 --> 39:48.020
Not much of a morning person,
is he?

39:48.456 --> 39:50.055
I'm going to go take a shower.

39:54.295 --> 39:55.360
[JOHN] Hey, Coop.

Let's see how well
you can swim, buddy.

41:48.442 --> 41:50.220
- Hey, buddy.
- You motherfucker.

41:50.244 --> 41:52.889
Oh, hey, man. What's the matter?
Did the tide get you?

41:52.913 --> 41:54.825
- The current too strong?
- You fucking dick.

41:54.849 --> 41:57.216
[JOHN] Aw, come on.
No harm, no foul.

41:57.451 --> 41:59.251

That's it...

42:22.576 --> 42:23.576
Woo!

42:24.011 --> 42:25.978
I'm gonna retire out here.

42:27.615 --> 42:30.015
- You're retiring?
- Yeah.

42:30.484 --> 42:33.552

42:33.954 --> 42:35.888
Not a care in the world.

All I need is a good woman

42:38.592 --> 42:41.004
and enough money
to take island runs.

42:41.028 --> 42:43.362
That wouldn't be so bad,
would it?

42:44.531 --> 42:46.176
I guess it wouldn't.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.200
[GRUNTS]

42:49.003 --> 42:51.503
Plus, there's nobody around

What about that guy?

43:02.483 --> 43:03.526
Oh, yeah.

Looks like he's trying
to hone in on your action.

43:07.488 --> 43:08.553
Maybe.

- You're a dick.
- I know, I know.

44:12.619 --> 44:14.397

made me hungry.

for dinner?

44:19.159 --> 44:20.670
- Fish.
- Oh, okay. Great.

44:20.694 --> 44:22.639
- I caught that.
- Oh, good.

44:22.663 --> 44:24.307
Have you seen
where that boat went?

44:24.331 --> 44:26.376
I think it went back
for civilization.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.178
What are you two talking about?

44:28.202 --> 44:30.769
There's a fishing boat
out there a little while ago.

44:31.638 --> 44:33.049
- Oh.
- It's no big deal,

44:33.073 --> 44:34.750
nothing to worry about.

I'm more worried about you two.

Oh, no need, Mom.

44:38.479 --> 44:40.412

if we do a prayer first?

- [COOPER] Sure.
- Sure.

of the air, land, and sea.

on this bountiful harvest.

Okay, let's eat.

45:13.547 --> 45:15.125
[COOPER] You said
there was a story

45:15.149 --> 45:16.949
behind the name of the boat.
What's the story?

45:17.217 --> 45:18.261
<i>Bella Wood.</i>

45:18.285 --> 45:20.163
[JOHN] There is,
and it's a good one.

45:20.187 --> 45:26.102
So, I got my love of the ocean
from my pop and my grandpop.

45:26.126 --> 45:27.470
My pop was in the Navy

45:27.494 --> 45:29.172
and my grandpa
in the Marine Corps.

45:29.196 --> 45:31.263
And you were
the only one who sat out?

45:33.700 --> 45:35.311
I had a medical condition.

45:35.335 --> 45:37.569
[COOPER] Eh, that's not the way
Danny said it.

45:38.639 --> 45:39.771
Anyway...

45:41.075 --> 45:45.422
my grandpop,
he served in World War I.

45:45.446 --> 45:47.612
Second Marine Division.

45:48.082 --> 45:49.147
France?

45:49.817 --> 45:51.394
June 1918.

45:51.418 --> 45:52.617
The Battle of Belleau Wood.

45:53.153 --> 45:54.352
You know your history.

45:55.222 --> 45:58.201
So, my grandpa was, uh, Anson.

45:58.225 --> 46:01.793
He was injured in that battle
and he, uh,

46:02.396 --> 46:04.774
somehow, by the grace of God,
found his way

46:04.798 --> 46:07.577
to this rundown hospital
in a nearby town.

46:07.601 --> 46:10.680
And, uh, there he was tended to

46:10.704 --> 46:14.451
by this beautiful French nurse.

46:14.475 --> 46:15.552
Was she brunette?

46:15.576 --> 46:17.353
Oh, and with a big heart?

46:17.377 --> 46:19.277
[COOPER] Oh, did she drive
a Camaro?

46:19.513 --> 46:21.847
Have I told you guys
this story before?

46:22.783 --> 46:25.829
So for some reason or another,

46:25.853 --> 46:28.186
my grandfather
nicknamed her Bella.

46:28.388 --> 46:31.434
Um, this chick didn't speak
a lick of English.

46:31.458 --> 46:33.703
Well, my grandfather
would call out

46:33.727 --> 46:36.306
and have I mentioned to you
how smooth he was?

46:36.330 --> 46:39.242
He would call out "Bella"
and this nurse,

46:39.266 --> 46:41.611
she'd would run to him,
change his bandages,

46:41.635 --> 46:45.181
give him a sponge bath,
and Lord knows what else she did

46:45.205 --> 46:48.184
because whatever it was,
he started dreaming about her.

46:48.208 --> 46:50.487
And how I know this
is his bunkmates told him

46:50.511 --> 46:52.722
that in the middle of the night,
while he was dreaming,

46:52.746 --> 46:55.547
he would call out
"Bella-wood Bella-wood".

46:55.883 --> 46:57.916
So your grandmother's name
is Bella?

46:58.352 --> 46:59.596
- No.
- [VIVIAN] Oh.

46:59.620 --> 47:01.898
No. Look, my grandmother
was a saint,

47:01.922 --> 47:04.601
God rest her soul.
But I don't think my grandpa

47:04.625 --> 47:06.658
ever got over Bella. [CHUCKLES]

47:06.793 --> 47:08.371
Well, that's understandable.

47:08.395 --> 47:10.896
I mean, she was there for him
when he needed her most.

47:12.633 --> 47:14.344
- [JOHN] Yeah. Oh.
- [PHONE RINGS]

47:14.368 --> 47:16.501
[JOHN] Hey, looks like
we got service again.

47:16.770 --> 47:17.881
Hey, it's Sam.

47:17.905 --> 47:19.182
I gotta take this, guys.

47:19.206 --> 47:20.572
- [VIVIAN] Aw.
- Hey, Sam.

47:20.841 --> 47:22.807
That was such a sweet story.

47:24.244 --> 47:25.288
Really?

47:25.312 --> 47:27.406
I don't think it was sweet
for the nurse

47:27.430 --> 47:29.526
that had to change
the horny dude's bandages.

47:29.550 --> 47:31.516
- [LAUGHING]
- Stop being such a cynic.

48:15.596 --> 48:18.430
Viv, do you my have my, uh...

48:54.401 --> 48:56.946
- [COOPER] You want that?
- Ooh, wow. Instant refill.

48:56.970 --> 48:59.804
[VIVIAN LAUGHING]

49:00.907 --> 49:02.607
You guys want to play
cards again?

49:04.544 --> 49:06.411
Oh, fuck poker.

49:06.913 --> 49:08.813
I got a better idea.

49:10.050 --> 49:11.561
Truth or dare.

49:11.585 --> 49:13.263
Now I know you're really drunk.

49:13.287 --> 49:15.131
No, I'm serious.

49:15.155 --> 49:17.000
I haven't played that game
since like junior high.

49:17.024 --> 49:19.502
That doesn't matter,
you're still fucking brunettes

49:19.526 --> 49:21.471
and I can still hotwire
anything that moves.

49:21.495 --> 49:23.061
I haven't been hotwired yet.

49:23.497 --> 49:24.774
[COOPER] Are you sure
about that?

49:24.798 --> 49:26.698
Yeah, that's not what I heard
last night.

49:26.900 --> 49:29.045
- Gross, John.
- [JOHN] Yeah, you're telling me.

49:29.069 --> 49:31.347
It is gross, my virgin ears.

49:31.371 --> 49:32.681
No.

49:32.705 --> 49:34.017
God, Coop,
this is a really bad idea.

49:34.041 --> 49:35.818
Come on,
we haven't hung out like this

49:35.842 --> 49:37.287
since before my last tour.

49:37.311 --> 49:39.444
What's going on since then
and, hey,

49:39.646 --> 49:41.357
I want to hear a little bit more

49:41.381 --> 49:44.360
- about that Samantha chick.
- Oh, yeah. Fine, fine, fine.

49:44.384 --> 49:46.318
Oh. Oh, wow.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.765
- I don't even know how to play.
- Oh, it's okay.

49:48.789 --> 49:51.034
I'll break down the rules
for you, it's real simple.

Whosoever asking the question
has complete control.

49:53.593 --> 49:54.904
No question is out
of the question,

49:54.928 --> 49:56.673
not even my time in the service,

49:56.697 --> 49:59.331
but you have to answer
truthfully.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.512
Oh, I can't believe
we're gonna do this.

50:02.536 --> 50:04.647
And if it's a dare,
you have to do the dare.

50:04.671 --> 50:06.316
That's it, that's the rules.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.784
All right, fine. Fine.

50:07.808 --> 50:09.741
- I'm in.
- [COOPER] Yes, we're doing it.

50:11.345 --> 50:12.610
Okay, you go first.

50:13.380 --> 50:14.612
It's your boat, you go first.

50:15.048 --> 50:16.114
Okay.

your virginity?

50:28.829 --> 50:31.074
Hey, I don't know the answer
to that question.

50:31.098 --> 50:33.064
- Ah!
- [COOPER] Yes, you do.

50:33.700 --> 50:35.445
It was on our fourth date.

50:35.469 --> 50:38.114
Yeah, I don't think
that's you telling the truth.

50:38.138 --> 50:39.749
Well, it's not your question.

50:39.773 --> 50:41.551
- Well...
- [JOHN] I don't think

50:41.575 --> 50:42.618

You said "honesty."

- [VIVIAN] Mm-hmm.
- I was 17 years old.

[VIVIAN] With who?

50:49.750 --> 50:51.794
One question at a time, please.

50:51.818 --> 50:53.918
Okay, my turn, my turn.

50:54.554 --> 50:55.965
Truth or dare, Coop?

50:55.989 --> 50:57.055
Dare.

50:57.791 --> 50:58.901
Who with?

50:58.925 --> 51:00.136
[COOPER] I said dare.

51:00.160 --> 51:04.396
Okay. I dare you to tell me
who with, truthfully.

51:05.866 --> 51:09.501
Uh, some girl named Amanda.

51:09.803 --> 51:12.582
I played football
and she was a cheerleader

51:12.606 --> 51:16.441
and it was the American dream
kind of, not really.

51:18.011 --> 51:19.711

51:22.749 --> 51:24.527
One question.
No more questions.

to my wedding...

51:29.623 --> 51:31.467
I mean, my wed... our wedding.

- Anything.
- I'm sorry, Viv.

any question

You are so fucking predictable.

52:05.525 --> 52:07.437
You do not have
to answer this question.

52:07.461 --> 52:09.572
[COOPER] No, it's okay,
I'll answer the question.

52:09.596 --> 52:12.008
It's only fitting
that the good doctor

52:12.032 --> 52:14.177
who is supposed
to be saving people's lives

52:14.201 --> 52:16.813
is so curious about
the other side of the equation.

52:16.837 --> 52:18.181

of running from them.

- [COOPER] Excellent choice.

- Dare.

to kiss him.

- [COOPER] Yes, he is.
- No, I am not gonna kiss her.

the rules for you?
