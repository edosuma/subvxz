WEBVTT

00:58.025 --> 00:59.327
Morning.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.795
Oh. I made pancakes.
Mm.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.498
Oh, your lips
are very shiny.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.067
It's just
my normal lip gloss.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.503
You don't
normally have it on
for breakfast.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.140
Hm.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.741
Mmm, these are delicious.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.144
Mm.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.347
Where is my apple?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.514
One of you
moved my apple.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.551
Oh, it was just
blocking the shot.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.753
Try not to look
directly into camera.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.562
So, tell me
about how you two
met and fell in love.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.729
Uh...

01:35.863 --> 01:37.431
First
we were neighbors,

01:37.565 --> 01:41.535
then we became friends,
then roommates.

01:41.669 --> 01:45.072
We bonded over our love
of pancakes and karaoke.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.176
And before we knew it,
we were having
our first kiss.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.677
We were drunk
from tequila,

01:49.810 --> 01:51.612
and I vomited
immediately after.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.880
Yeah.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.915
And Lea said
we were just friends,

01:55.048 --> 01:57.785
and she said that was all we
could be because of my autism,

01:57.918 --> 02:00.621
and I thought she was
superficial and prejudiced.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.956
But I was wrong about her,
and she was, too.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.559
She could be happy
and in love with me.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.763
So she asked me
to marry her,
and I said yes.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.432
You sure did.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.733
I have to go.

02:12.866 --> 02:13.734
Okay.

02:14.902 --> 02:15.969
Oh.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.144
We need you
to sign a release form.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.579
I don't want
to be on TV.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.215
Well, we can always
just blur you out.
Mm.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.149
You don't want
to be blurred.
It'll be fun.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.918
We'll be the younger,
more outrageous
supporting characters

02:31.051 --> 02:32.085
in <i>The Shaun Show.</i>

02:32.220 --> 02:33.487
It is not my show.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.589
All this for you.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.493
Oh, looks like Dr. Andrews

02:39.627 --> 02:41.962
is hoping for
"Special Appearance by"
billing.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.232
I didn't expect
to make it to California.
Oh.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.699
San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital

02:45.833 --> 02:47.067
has one of
the most rigorous

02:47.201 --> 02:48.769
surgical
training programs
in the country.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.003
Only a select few make it

02:50.137 --> 02:52.139
through this rigorous
five-year residency,

02:52.273 --> 02:55.343
which traditionally
culminates with a test

02:55.476 --> 03:00.448
to see if those residents
are prepared to be attendings.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.716
Did I say "rigorous" twice?
I can take that again.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.352
Uh, don't... Don't worry.
You're doing great.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.786
Can I get
your autograph?

03:08.956 --> 03:11.058
Dr. Murphy and Dr. Park,

03:11.191 --> 03:13.961
today each of you
will be put in charge
of a surgical case

03:14.094 --> 03:17.665
and evaluated based
on your O.R. performance,

03:17.798 --> 03:20.133
your ability
to delegate responsibility,

03:20.268 --> 03:23.771
to manage junior residents,
and think on your feet.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.806
The next surgical cases
that come through the E.R.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.040
will be all yours.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.978
Aah!

03:31.111 --> 03:32.413
Dana Bradley, 34,

03:32.546 --> 03:33.814
burns to her head
and left forearm.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.083
At least 10%
total body surface area.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.121
I see areas
of second-degree burns,

03:41.255 --> 03:43.291
forehead, scalp, and cheek
with associated burn blisters,

03:43.424 --> 03:45.293
likely mid-to-deep dermal
partial thickness burns.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.028
Send blood for CBC, urea,
electrolytes, lactate,

03:48.161 --> 03:48.996
and get EKG
and chest film.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.901
Okay, give one milligram
of Dilaudid.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.437
Dana, it's okay.
We're giving you something
stronger for the pain.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.607
Start IV antibiotics.
Capillary refill is sluggish.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.642
She needs acute surgery
to debride.

04:01.775 --> 04:02.676
Let's go!

04:16.557 --> 04:18.726
Grant Ferlin,
44-year-old firefighter,

04:18.859 --> 04:21.161
level two trauma,
multiple injuries
from a fall.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.763
What about burns?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.865
No burns.
He saved a woman
from the fire,

04:24.998 --> 04:26.400
then he got pinned
by a beam.

04:26.534 --> 04:27.601
Sir, please go
to the waiting room.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.202
We'll keep you updated.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.704
Dr. Park,
this is your case.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.345
Villanueva, we need
all hands on deck.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.449
He's tachycardic
and hypotensive.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.650
Could be bleeding
into his abdomen.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.251
Give me the ultrasound.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.519
Give me the ultrasound!

04:50.358 --> 04:51.925
Intraperitoneal hemorrhage.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.694
We need to open him up.
Let's go.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.931
Excision knife.

04:58.065 --> 05:02.069
Apply even pressure
against the wound.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.205
Starting the tangential
sequential excision.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.743
Shaun
would be an asset
to any hospital.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.946
He views the world
a bit differently

05:13.080 --> 05:16.384
and therefore sees patients
a little bit differently.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.421
But we accept him
just as he is.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.756
Did you
always feel that way?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.462
There was a time

05:28.596 --> 05:32.800
where I didn't feel Shaun
belonged at this hospital.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.606
Luckily,
I got my arm twisted.

05:38.739 --> 05:42.976
Shaun's contributions
have far outweighed
his surgical gifts.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.113
She's in v-tach.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.952
Is he okay?
Why is he stopping?

05:52.085 --> 05:55.322
Sometimes
he gets these ideas,

05:55.456 --> 05:57.324
more like visions.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.426
It's very effective.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.162
I'm not sure
what that is.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.766
Your lights are in my eyes.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.100
Please turn them off.
Step back.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.207
She's hypothermic.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.143
We need more aggressive
fluid resuscitation.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.812
I'll place a femoral line
using a rewarming catheter.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.655
Okay.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.025
We need to assess
the duodenal rupture.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.193
I'll run the bowel,

06:33.326 --> 06:35.228
rule out
any other perforations.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.830
Babcocks and OG tube
to suction.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.636
His surgical technique
is really advanced.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.104
He has such command
over the room.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.806
Shut up.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.176
Suction.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.720
I found the bleeder.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.355
Coagulating.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.224
Next I'll repair
the rupture site.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.232
Bleeding stopped.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.205
Let's close him up,

07:18.338 --> 07:19.873
get a post-op CT
to make sure
we got everything.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.213
I've heard that Shaun
sometimes has visions?

07:26.346 --> 07:27.548
What are they like?

07:35.523 --> 07:36.857
Pretty good, huh?

07:36.990 --> 07:38.325
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.727
It's more like...

07:42.362 --> 07:45.265
Um, sorry,
but you're no Shaun.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.737
Nobody can do Shaun's
vision thingies but him.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.205
It's his superpower,

07:52.339 --> 07:55.108
like he has an X-Ray,
MRI, and CT

07:55.242 --> 07:57.444
all in his head
all at the same time.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.547
I'm never gonna be able
to do that.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.752
But what I've learned
from watching Shaun is,

08:04.885 --> 08:06.787
figure out
what you're good at
and lean into that.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.489
What's your superpower?

08:10.423 --> 08:11.391
How much time do you have?

08:14.795 --> 08:17.497
The surgery was a success.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.834
We were able to eliminate
all non-viable tissue

08:20.968 --> 08:22.870
and use autograft
over the entire

08:23.003 --> 08:24.738
burn surface area.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.740
What are they
doing here?

08:26.874 --> 08:29.543
They are taping me.
They will blur out
your face.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.146
When can I see my family?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.415
The nurse is bringing them.
They should be here shortly.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.787
That hurts!

08:41.989 --> 08:43.957
You are on
strong IV narcotics,

08:44.091 --> 08:46.560
and the grafts
should still be numb.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.496
Please stop.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.031
Stop!

08:51.164 --> 08:52.499
It hurts!

08:52.633 --> 08:53.967
I am not touching you.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.806
There is significant
swelling and edema.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.508
It is pulling on
the graft anchor sites.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.543
That doesn't make sense.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.978
Mommy?

09:06.614 --> 09:07.581
Yes.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.284
Baby.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.689
I'm here.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.859
I want to go home.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.152
I can't do this.
Okay, okay, okay.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.594
Hello. Dana's autografts
were procured,

09:54.728 --> 09:56.196
placed,
and secured perfectly.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.932
We started IV Ancef before
surgery, continued post-op,

09:59.066 --> 10:01.001
and confirmed none
of the tissues removed
had positive cultures.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.803
The grafts
should not be failing.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.773
Did you keep her
wound dressings moistened?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.540
Yes, and her edema
is getting worse,

10:07.675 --> 10:09.009
even after
replacing dressings.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.411
You need to go
double-check her labs.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.213
I know what I did.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.216
I memorize all data
in my patient charts.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.951
Did you use proper
sterile technique and prep

10:18.085 --> 10:19.219
on all autograft sites?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.722
Yes.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.257
Adequate fluid resuscitation
and replacement for losses?

10:24.391 --> 10:27.661
I checked urine output
and central venous pressure
every...

10:29.730 --> 10:31.965
Hour, but she was
really uncomfortable,

10:32.099 --> 10:33.000
so I skipped one,
but I don't think...

10:33.133 --> 10:35.002
No, you cannot skip steps.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.704
Go review
every vitals check,

10:36.837 --> 10:38.906
all urine output
ins and outs,
and every CVP.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.852
Hey. My boys tell me you're
a former brother in blue.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.286
Walked the beat
for 15 years.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.924
Can we talk privately?

10:57.057 --> 10:58.658
Oh, we're all
squad here.

11:02.896 --> 11:08.001
Grant, your CT showed
you have an unstable
lumbar fracture.

11:08.135 --> 11:11.772
You'll need extensive
posterior fusion surgery
to stabilize it.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.108
How long before
I'm back on the job?

11:15.242 --> 11:16.509
You'll be up and walking
in a few days.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.014
But after this kind of fusion,
your spine...

11:24.885 --> 11:26.586
You won't be able
to be a firefighter anymore.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.827
Then you need
to figure out
a different plan.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.162
This is
the safest surgery.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.330
Your abdominal injury poses
too many risks for us to...

11:37.464 --> 11:40.533
We run into
burning buildings
for a living.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.935
I'm not afraid
of a risk.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.308
I trust you to get me
back to my team.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.552
You okay?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.156
I'm just double-checking
our patient's lab work.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.826
That's some emotional
lab work.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.864
Shaun thinks I caused
our patient's graft issues,

12:10.998 --> 12:13.066
and he said so on camera.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.169
And I'm...

12:17.504 --> 12:20.240
I'm so angry at myself
for skipping a step.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.182
But I don't think
I caused the edema.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.824
Sorry about
this morning.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.091
Rough day.
It happens.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.192
I need approvals.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.930
We implemented
a new system last week.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.531
You're working
off the old one.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.133
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.202
You were late
on training day.
Redo it.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.204
And maybe cool it
with the personal calls
on the floor.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.445
Please let this be
an actual medical issue.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.381
My patient's refusing
posterior fusion surgery.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.550
We need an alternative
that will get him back
on his feet.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.953
Posterior fusion would
get him on his feet.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.221
He just wants to
carry someone
on his back.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.792
We could try ventral surgery
through his abdomen.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.028
L3 is hard
to get to ventrally,

13:15.162 --> 13:16.763
even if everything
was perfect.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.298
But if we try
a transpedicular approach,

13:18.431 --> 13:19.799
we could do
a posterior cage placement

13:19.933 --> 13:21.401
and short segment surgery.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.037
There's a risk
of catastrophic
nerve injury

13:24.171 --> 13:26.239
or an uncontrollable bleed

13:26.373 --> 13:28.108
from placing
too large a cage.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.245
Would you try it?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.417
Your patient,
your call.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.256
What do I love most
about Shaun?

13:44.691 --> 13:46.059
I can't choose.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.931
He's brilliant,
and he's so funny.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.467
He makes me feel safe.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.704
I know no matter what happens,
he's there for me.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.306
And he's super cute.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.276
Shaun, what do you love
the most about Lea?

14:06.813 --> 14:07.747
Shaun.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.853
I love...

14:15.122 --> 14:18.125
That her eyes crinkle
when she is happy

14:18.258 --> 14:20.127
or sad or angry
or worried.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.830
And I know
which one means what.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.266
You know
my eye crinkles?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.635
That one
means she is happy.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.503
Yes.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.273
I double-checked
every recorded vital sign

14:33.406 --> 14:34.874
and hourly urine output.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.876
All suggest
adequate blood pressure
to maintain graft profusion

14:37.010 --> 14:38.845
and no signs
of fluid overload.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.147
I don't know
what caused it,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.415
but Dana's edema and graft
issues are not my fault.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.892
I need to see
your footage.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.830
Stop.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.766
Play it from there.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.709
The grafts
should not be failing.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.244
Something must
have gone wrong.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.346
I need the answers to fix it.
Please rewind.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.523
S-Stop.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.694
Okay.
Play at half speed.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.770
Right there.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.610
When I pressed that burn area,
she did not feel it.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.879
If they were second-degree,
mid-dermis burns,

15:47.014 --> 15:48.148
it would have hurt.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.218
Dana has
third-degree burns.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.453
The tissue is dying
under the grafts

15:53.586 --> 15:56.256
because I did not
debride deep enough.

15:59.826 --> 16:03.663
Dana's problem
is my mistake.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.540
Shaun has always been
great with medicine,

16:14.241 --> 16:16.143
but romance, not so much.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.810
<i>I took him through boot camp,</i>

16:17.944 --> 16:20.213
and then he and Lea
got together.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.714
I guess you could
call me Cupid.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.850
You don't get credit
for Shaun and Lea
getting together.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.788
You barely get credit
for us getting together.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.657
I have to go practice
my surgery.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.496
Your first surgery
did not work.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.433
I didn't debride deep enough.
We need to fix it.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.137
How's your pain level?

16:46.739 --> 16:50.577
I'm... A monster.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.485
No wonder Nicole ran away.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.154
Okay.

17:01.288 --> 17:04.657
We have to do
another surgery,

17:04.791 --> 17:06.459
or you could
become septic.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.529
Will it fix
the way my face looks?

17:09.662 --> 17:11.464
No. Your face
will look worse

17:11.598 --> 17:13.200
because we have to
debride deeper.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.367
I can't.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.735
We have to fix the mistake.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.539
How you look
doesn't impact your health.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.644
Okay.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.054
Do you want me
to get your husband?

17:35.188 --> 17:37.690
I'm sure he wants to see you
before you go into surgery.

17:37.824 --> 17:38.725
No.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.729
Nicole needs him.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.511
That's not gonna work.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.215
You need to get
wider exposure
and corpectomy

18:02.349 --> 18:03.683
before placing the cage.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.520
There is
an easier solution.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.523
Tell your patient
he's being an idiot.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.594
It's not worth
risking his life
for his career.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.430
I think he's right.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.668
When I left the force,

18:21.801 --> 18:24.771
I felt more alone than
any other time in my life.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.542
I didn't just leave
a job, I...

18:31.744 --> 18:32.912
I left a family.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.482
He wants to fight
to keep his,

18:35.615 --> 18:36.749
so I'm gonna do
what I can
to help him.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.826
I'll drill off the complete
pedicle and L3 body.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.462
You decompress on the lamina
above and below.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.599
It'll allow for
a safer cage placement.

18:59.038 --> 19:00.407
I don't think
Dana is ready

19:00.540 --> 19:02.108
for the free tissue flap
reconstruction.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.576
We could start with
daily tissue removal.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.678
No, we should not wait.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.581
Deeper debridement
and temporoparietal
fascia surgery

19:08.715 --> 19:09.916
will clear her edema.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.285
It's a high-risk surgery
with high risk of blood loss

19:12.419 --> 19:13.720
and flap necrosis.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.689
Before we do
another big procedure,

19:16.823 --> 19:18.525
she needs to recover
psychologically.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.793
She could develop infection
and compartment syndrome
if we wait.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.600
You missed
what the patient
was feeling

19:27.734 --> 19:30.069
in your initial diagnosis,
and it affected her outcome.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.306
You could be wrong
about this, too.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.249
The free tissue flap surgery

19:42.382 --> 19:45.017
will correct the damage
from her burns.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.021
I am the attending.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.123
This is my decision.

20:04.937 --> 20:05.672
My patient...

20:06.439 --> 20:07.740
N-No.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.681
Shaun,
what's going on?

20:14.814 --> 20:16.383
My patient has to
have another surgery.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.584
I thought she had
second-degree burns.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.819
She also has
third-degree burns.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.821
Okay, so do another surgery.

20:21.954 --> 20:25.892
If I had not been distracted
by the cameras,

20:26.025 --> 20:29.228
I do not think I would have
missed her reaction.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.631
Third-degree burns
are always numb.

20:31.764 --> 20:32.832
So you can do
another surgery.

20:37.003 --> 20:42.675
This is my test to prove
I am ready to be
an attending, okay?

20:42.809 --> 20:43.810
I made a mistake.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.645
And you caught
the mistake.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.747
But I shouldn't
have missed it, okay?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.015
It was my fault.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.583
Okay,
so it was your fault.

20:50.717 --> 20:51.884
So?

20:52.018 --> 20:54.454
Just like it was my fault
when I was attending

20:54.587 --> 20:56.656
that I-I missed
a subdural empyema

20:56.789 --> 20:59.426
and Park punctured
a fungal nodule

20:59.559 --> 21:00.560
and Claire missed a PE.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.396
The patient didn't die, right?

21:03.530 --> 21:06.098
You can do another surgery.
So let's just focus on that.

21:08.034 --> 21:13.005
I am different than you
and Claire and Dr. Park.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.707
I do not
get to make mistakes.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.078
Is this because
this video crew

21:19.211 --> 21:21.213
has been
following you around
wherever you go?

21:22.248 --> 21:23.215
Yes.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.884
I made two mistakes...

21:25.017 --> 21:27.219
The burns
and letting them film me.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.055
You know what?
Get rid of them.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.691
If you don't want them around,
just get rid of them.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.959
And another thing,
Shaun,

21:34.661 --> 21:37.764
you can't expect
to be perfect
all the time.

21:40.032 --> 21:43.603
It doesn't happen, ever,
for anyone.

21:55.214 --> 21:55.948
No.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.918
<i>Again, it's helpful</i>

21:59.051 --> 22:01.253
if you include the question
in the answer.

22:01.388 --> 22:02.922
What was the question?

22:03.055 --> 22:04.791
Do you see yourself
as Shaun's protector?

22:06.292 --> 22:08.461
Oh, um...

22:08.595 --> 22:12.264
No, I don't see myself
as Shaun's protector anymore.

22:14.100 --> 22:14.967
How does that feel?

22:16.803 --> 22:18.237
How does it feel?
I don't know.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.173
It feels great.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.476
I'm proud of him

22:24.411 --> 22:26.345
and relieved...

22:28.848 --> 22:30.016
...that he's gonna make it.

22:30.983 --> 22:31.818
What changed?

22:36.222 --> 22:36.989
He did.

22:37.924 --> 22:38.825
He changed.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.494
Can you elaborate?

22:46.332 --> 22:48.601
He grew up and met Lea.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.271
Okay, we need to talk.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.674
Turn the camera off.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.676
Sorry, no.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.813
Okay, then I'm gonna have to
say what I have to say naked.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.518
You can take five.
Thank you.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.656
You need to
back off Shaun
a little bit.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.724
It's my job
to ask questions.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.225
I was expecting
wedding surprises,

23:13.359 --> 23:16.563
and instead I feel like
you're exploiting his autism.

23:16.696 --> 23:19.131
You knew
Shaun's ASD was gonna
be part of the show.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.000
I didn't expect you
to make a highlight reel

23:21.133 --> 23:22.735
out of his
most spectrum-y moments.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.771
I'm not
manufacturing anything.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.739
Shaun made a mistake
on a very important case,

23:26.873 --> 23:28.608
and now that could end up
on your show.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.677
He's totally rattled.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.878
I know you want
to protect him.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.480
This is not about
protecting Shaun.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.914
This is about
the whole world seeing him

23:35.047 --> 23:36.883
as a collection of quirks
and a single mistake.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.089
But since that
is good TV...

23:52.965 --> 23:54.767
<i>Dana</i>
<i>has third-degree burns.</i>

23:56.569 --> 23:58.037
<i>Dana has third-degree burns.</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:00.940
<i>Dana has third-degree burns.</i>

24:01.073 --> 24:03.275
<i>Her tissue is dying</i>
<i>under the graft</i>

24:03.409 --> 24:05.177
<i>because I did not</i>
<i>debride deep enough.</i>

24:06.813 --> 24:08.881
<i>Dana's problem is my mistake.</i>

24:09.015 --> 24:12.819
I'm not gonna use
any of the footage

24:12.952 --> 24:14.654
related to your mistake.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.789
It's not relevant.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.626
This is a wedding show.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.127
Lea reminded me
of that.

24:23.930 --> 24:27.466
I do not want
to be dishonest.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.269
It's not dishonest.

24:30.402 --> 24:34.874
It's focused on you and Lea
and your relationship

24:35.007 --> 24:37.944
and your amazing career
as a surgeon,

24:38.077 --> 24:40.813
surrounded by all of these
people who support you.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.251
That is what
will give hope

24:45.384 --> 24:48.788
to people
who feel different
and alone.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.725
That's why
I'm doing this.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.739
Grant's case file.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.679
I've successfully completed
the short-segment
posterior fusion

25:12.812 --> 25:13.946
on the skills dummy
simulator.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.716
Once.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.719
With a partner.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.955
You've successfully done it
on real people over 50 times.

25:25.424 --> 25:26.525
You should
take the lead.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.694
Which would mean
removing yourself

25:27.827 --> 25:28.961
as the attending
on this case.

25:30.597 --> 25:33.365
I'm not risking my patient's
life to pass a test.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.968
You're risking
your own career
to try to save his.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.975
Grant deserves
the best shot to get back
to his crew.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.889
Any cold feet?

25:57.757 --> 25:58.891
Shaun is my person.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.860
I know that beyond
a shadow of a doubt.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.200
Do you think
I should let Sophie

26:08.334 --> 26:10.002
remove my mistake
from the show?

26:15.207 --> 26:17.009
I think
that is up to you.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.277
How do you feel
about it?

26:19.712 --> 26:22.949
It feels like a lie,

26:23.082 --> 26:26.018
but is it more important
to give people truth or hope?

26:27.887 --> 26:29.822
That's a tough question.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.223
Yes.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.560
I say we stick
to the two of you,

26:34.694 --> 26:37.263
who are getting married
in just a few days.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.732
Any nerves about that?

26:39.866 --> 26:41.934
Oh, no. She is also my person.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.603
I have known that
for a long time.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.806
I have to go prep
for my surgery.
Okay.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.607
Okay, I have to go prep
for my surgery.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.050
It took you longer to be sure
that Shaun was the one.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.387
In fact, you said
you couldn't get
involved with him

27:01.520 --> 27:02.822
because of his ASD.

27:03.756 --> 27:04.924
What changed?

27:21.774 --> 27:24.010
I offered to take out
the mistake because
you were right.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.411
I crossed a line.

27:25.544 --> 27:27.146
Instead of
embarrassing Shaun,

27:27.279 --> 27:28.981
now you're zeroing in on me?

27:29.115 --> 27:31.383
I'm not trying
to embarrass anyone.

27:31.517 --> 27:32.919
Can you please
slow down?

27:34.620 --> 27:37.990
As a little person, the world
doesn't accommodate me.

27:38.124 --> 27:41.427
That's why representation
matters, but when it's real.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.629
I'm not asking you
to make us look
like a fairy tale.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.332
Fairy tales have obstacles
and conflict.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.667
The story
you want me to tell,

27:48.801 --> 27:51.838
you two met and fell in love
and everything's great,

27:51.971 --> 27:54.006
it's boring.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.875
So you want me to play
the wicked witch.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.811
You are are not defined
by your lowest moment,

27:58.945 --> 28:00.780
but you can't deny it,
either.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.785
I am here
to tell the real story
of you as a couple.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.456
Do you still trust me
to do that?

28:18.430 --> 28:19.832
Your vitals are good,

28:19.966 --> 28:21.533
and your volume status
is stable.

28:21.667 --> 28:24.003
A nurse will come get you
for surgery soon.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.151
I'm so sorry the cameras
added to your pain.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.858
I was gonna have to
see myself eventually.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.796
My daughter will have to
look at me every day...

28:52.398 --> 28:54.600
...and pretend
she doesn't
see a monster.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.437
She won't see you
that way forever.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.538
Other people will.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.977
Other kids will tease
and bully her...

29:07.346 --> 29:08.747
...because of what
her mother looks like.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.685
People have teased
and bullied me my whole life,

29:15.154 --> 29:18.490
and it hurt
for a long time,

29:18.624 --> 29:22.795
and I was too ashamed
to tell anyone.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.798
I finally told my mom.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.567
She taught me how to
stick up for myself.

29:29.836 --> 29:34.506
You can be an example
of how to get back up

29:34.640 --> 29:36.075
when life
knocks you down.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.412
Your strength

29:40.546 --> 29:44.550
will make her more
compassionate
than most people

29:44.683 --> 29:47.053
and more powerful
than any bully.

30:02.734 --> 30:03.802
Scalpel.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.111
I'll come get you
as soon as your mom
is awake.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.481
I don't want
to see her, Daddy.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.323
It's okay to be scared.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.258
You know what helps me
whenever I'm scared?

30:28.794 --> 30:30.829
A big hug.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.066
The best ones
are from my mom.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.469
Do your mom's hugs
make you feel better?

30:42.774 --> 30:47.479
I know Mommy looks different,
but her hugs are the same.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.582
They're full
of the same love
as always.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.599
We are doing Dana's
fascial flap surgery.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.437
Are you here because
I am the attending

31:11.570 --> 31:13.205
or because
you trust my judgment?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.075
Mostly the latter.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.346
Even after
my earlier mistake?

31:26.852 --> 31:28.154
You're a great doctor.

31:29.521 --> 31:33.325
I hope one day
I'm even close
to as good as you.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.029
Your mistake
just made you more...

31:38.965 --> 31:40.666
Inspirational.

31:40.799 --> 31:43.335
It gave me the confidence that
I'll find my superpower, too.

31:56.882 --> 31:59.518
You cannot film
this surgery.

31:59.651 --> 32:02.955
I cannot be distracted
while I am working.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.224
Let's go.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.163
I've drilled
most of the pedicle
and vertebral body.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.331
What's next?

32:12.464 --> 32:13.665
We need
to place the cage.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.069
Good decompression.

32:17.203 --> 32:18.870
One above, one below.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.378
Placing
the expandable cage.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.950
Heart rate's way up.
BP's dropping.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.453
Vessel's torn.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.388
It's detracted
away from the field.

32:38.257 --> 32:39.925
What about giving
T.X.A. and bipolar

32:40.059 --> 32:41.093
to pull the vessel
into view?

32:49.035 --> 32:49.835
BP still dropping.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.571
BP's 41 over 23.

32:52.704 --> 32:53.605
He'll arrest if we
don't stop things now.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.907
Vascular clip.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.425
We could try
completing the corpectomy
from the other side.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.999
No. It's not working.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.336
We're changing course.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.438
Let's do
the long segment L1-5
without a cage.

33:30.909 --> 33:31.943
You sure?

33:34.146 --> 33:35.447
My patient, my call.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.532
<i>Excision knife.</i>

34:12.684 --> 34:15.987
I need more sponges
and the suctions turned up.

34:17.423 --> 34:18.657
She's losing
too much blood.

34:21.993 --> 34:24.596
She's severely tachycardic,
blood pressure dropping.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.645
This holding
pressure isn't durable.
She's gonna bleed out.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.481
We have to
debride deeper.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.483
The excision blade
is causing
too much bleeding.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.185
Should we try the micro
dissection electrocautery?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.701
Electrocautery
won't work.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.371
We need to preserve as much
normal tissue as we can.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.407
A VERSAJET will debride
the appropriate plane
with less bleeding.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.757
We repaired
your lumbar fracture.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.596
But we had to
switch surgeries.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.135
You can't
do the job anymore.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.142
Your body
was giving out.

35:45.411 --> 35:46.445
I couldn't let you die.

35:50.216 --> 35:51.383
Grant.

35:53.885 --> 35:54.853
I trusted you.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.183
Oh.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.985
The surgery was a success.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.490
He had one of his visions,
saved the day again.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.958
Oh, and I missed it!

36:33.091 --> 36:34.326
I'll do the imitation
again.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.698
You can use all your footage,
even my mistake.

36:42.934 --> 36:47.273
Great surgeons
can make mistakes
and still be inspirational.

37:05.056 --> 37:05.924
Close the door.

37:13.699 --> 37:14.666
You're writing me up?

37:15.867 --> 37:17.403
Is this about
the charts?

37:17.536 --> 37:18.904
And coming in late.

37:19.037 --> 37:22.408
And taking personal calls,
calling off last-minute.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.377
I need to be able
to count on you,
and right now, I can't.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.681
I haven't been my best.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.551
Things at home...

37:48.233 --> 37:49.100
If...

37:50.969 --> 37:52.871
If I don't answer his calls,
he gets mad.

37:56.207 --> 37:58.076
He checks my mileage
and my phone

37:59.445 --> 38:00.712
and how much
makeup I wear.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.917
I helped a patient go through
a domestic violence checklist

38:07.586 --> 38:08.720
and realized...

38:10.756 --> 38:12.290
It was me, too.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.735
We'll figure this out.

38:30.241 --> 38:33.745
My re-grafting surgery
was a success.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.748
With restorative surgery,
you'll have an adequate
aesthetic outcome.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.119
Mommy?

39:02.408 --> 39:04.209
I look different, huh?

39:06.578 --> 39:07.813
Your eyes
are the same.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.951
They look like mine.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.579
I saw Lim.

39:50.255 --> 39:51.823
You passed your test.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.074
For a long time,

40:09.207 --> 40:10.909
I didn't think I could be
with someone like Shaun.

40:12.578 --> 40:15.380
I thought
we were too different,

40:15.514 --> 40:18.416
that I would have to
compromise too much.

40:21.319 --> 40:24.856
And I worried
about what people
would think of us.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.759
Of me.

40:30.829 --> 40:34.099
And I didn't want
to be seen as different.

40:35.867 --> 40:36.868
What changed?

40:40.572 --> 40:42.474
Me.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.643
Because of how Shaun saw me,

40:44.776 --> 40:46.612
he made me believe
that I am stronger

40:46.745 --> 40:48.246
than I give myself credit for.

40:50.982 --> 40:54.352
And that together,
we are enough.

40:55.987 --> 40:56.888
More than enough.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.591
That was very nice.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.596
Is it time
for the surprise?

41:12.437 --> 41:14.339
And...take 'em off!

41:16.407 --> 41:18.276
Surprise!

41:19.711 --> 41:20.712
Oh.

41:20.846 --> 41:23.314
Sophie, it's beautiful.

41:23.448 --> 41:27.753
The lights are very soothing,
and I like karaoke.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.755
This is
a very nice surprise.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.124
Okay.

41:33.258 --> 41:34.893
Hi!

41:35.026 --> 41:36.461
Are you sure
you're okay?

41:36.595 --> 41:37.629
I'm okay.
Okay.

41:37.763 --> 41:38.697
Shaun.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.865
Park.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.803
<i>Congratulations,</i>
<i>Shaun and Lea.</i>

41:45.771 --> 41:47.172
<i>This song is for you guys.</i>

42:14.465 --> 42:16.534
Congratulations!

42:27.613 --> 42:28.680
It's Claire!
