WEBVTT

00:26.193 --> 00:28.404
What's your pleasure, sir?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.706
Jesus.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.791
Wept.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.219
Not leaving us
so soon, are you?

00:56.057 --> 00:58.434
My God!

01:02.563 --> 01:04.147
Oh, God. No.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.651
We have such sights to show you.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.253
Steve!

01:26.378 --> 01:27.922
Shit!

01:28.047 --> 01:31.050
No. Don't do that.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.094
Go to hell!

03:29.668 --> 03:33.339
BBC London.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.301
Mother of God!

06:07.576 --> 06:09.787
Ah, the suffering.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.332
The sweet suffering.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.115
Welcome back.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.784
Where am I?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.994
This is the Channard Institute.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.247
It's a psychiatric hospital.

06:54.415 --> 06:58.210
- Psychiatric.
- Remember? You and your boyfriend?

06:59.002 --> 07:01.588
- Steve.
- Don't worry about him. He's OK.

07:02.131 --> 07:04.383
We sent him home hours ago.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.719
He had some story to tell.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.139
Who the fuck are you?

07:10.222 --> 07:12.099
I'm sorry.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.185
This job sometimes
makes me forget my manners.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.479
Ronson. Homicide.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.731
I was at your father's house.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.818
Oh, Daddy.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.647
Oh.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.246
Shit.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.790
Would you talk to me?

08:18.874 --> 08:22.544
And please, this time, no demons,
fairy tales, huh?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.089
Fairy tales?

08:27.216 --> 08:29.176
Fairy tales.

08:31.053 --> 08:33.554
My father didn't believe in fairy tales either.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.226
What?

08:38.602 --> 08:40.812
Some of them come true, Mr Ronson.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.982
Even the bad ones.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.944
I'm sorry. I, er.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.405
I-I don't understand.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.202
Do you have a family, Mr Ronson?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.330
- Yes.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.542
Kucich here, sir. We just found another one.

09:02.251 --> 09:05.379
Though it suffered a little
accidental damage.

09:06.588 --> 09:10.425
Anyway, just about the only portable
evidence we got around here,

09:10.509 --> 09:14.388
apart from the human remains,
is a mattress.

09:14.471 --> 09:18.225
Looks like someone was messed up
real bad on it. Can we send it downtown?

09:18.308 --> 09:22.563
Kucich, it's evidence.
Tag it and move it.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.024
Mattress.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.445
Julia.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.919
The mind is a labyrinth,
ladies and gentlemen, a puzzle.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.880
And while the paths of the brain
are plainly visible,

09:48.964 --> 09:51.258
its ways, deceptively apparent,

09:51.341 --> 09:54.094
its destinations are unknown,

09:54.177 --> 09:56.888
its secrets still secrets

09:57.014 --> 09:59.349
and, if we are honest,

09:59.433 --> 10:03.604
it is the lure of the labyrinth
that draws us to our chosen field

10:03.687 --> 10:05.647
to unlock those secrets.

10:05.731 --> 10:08.400
Others have been here before us
and have left us signs

10:08.483 --> 10:10.944
but we, as explorers of the mind,

10:11.028 --> 10:14.531
must devote our lives and energies
to going further,

10:15.324 --> 10:20.162
to tread the unexplored corridors,
in the hope of finding, ultimately,

10:20.245 --> 10:21.830
the final solution.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.425
We have to see.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.636
We have to know.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.972
Dr Channard, the new arrival
is awake and very distressed.

10:39.056 --> 10:42.559
My part in this is over.
Tidy for me, will you?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.770
Kyle, come with me.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.776
Now, this case, Kyle,
interesting but delicate.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.028
A very traumatized girl,

10:53.111 --> 10:55.072
a witness to multiple murder,

10:55.155 --> 10:58.158
involving members of her own family.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.870
The police brought her here hours ago
but she was lost beyond reach.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.789
And now she's back.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.125
What tales, I wonder,
will she bring us from the other side?

11:07.209 --> 11:09.670
- She'll probably be suffering.
- Good, Kyle.

11:09.753 --> 11:13.757
A speculative mind is an invaluable asset
to the analytic man.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.551
But all diagnosis begins with.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.554
- Examination?
- Precisely.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.724
You must win from them their trust,
draw from them their story

11:22.808 --> 11:25.310
and take from them their pain.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.270
- Easy!

11:27.354 --> 11:29.940
No! Don't.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.401
Take it easy and listen! It's gone.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.196
Whatever you saw, they're gone.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.116
I saw it and I saw him

11:39.199 --> 11:42.577
and then I got the box and I solved it
and then they came.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.247
- Who came?
- The Cenobites.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.749
- The demons.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.714
- I'm Dr Channard.
- Ronson.

11:53.839 --> 11:55.966
My assistant, Kyle MacRae.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.176
And this must be Kirsty.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.640
I've read the boy's statement.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.393
Quite the adventure they believe they had.

12:06.935 --> 12:10.689
I'd like to talk to her alone. Do you think?

12:10.772 --> 12:14.735
Yeah. OK. She's more in your territory
than she is in mine, anyhow.

12:16.445 --> 12:21.366
Kirsty, Dr Channard'll be taking care of you
from now on.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.328
Maybe we can talk tomorrow.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.206
OK?

12:30.542 --> 12:34.755
Wait. That mattress.
You've got to destroy that mattress.

12:34.838 --> 12:38.508
See, Julia died on it
and she can come back now, like Frank.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.929
Yeah. OK.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.731
You have got to destroy that mattress.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.568
You have got to destroy that mattress!

13:01.031 --> 13:03.074
Mind her.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.875
Detective, I'll be able to help this girl
but I need your assistance.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.171
I'm Kyle MacRae. Call me Kyle.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.925
That cop didn't believe me.

13:21.051 --> 13:25.180
Maybe not but that doesn't mean
you're not telling the truth.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.811
I'm sorry, Kirsty, I have to attend
to one of my patients.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.522
Kyle will give you something
to help you sleep.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.774
We shall speak tomorrow.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.834
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.463
Sad, huh?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.549
She's been here six months.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.676
She's a complete mystery.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.720
No family, no visitors.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.140
She's completely alone.

14:50.265 --> 14:53.852
- A nurse named her Tiffany.
- What's her real name?

14:53.935 --> 14:58.398
She never speaks.
All she does is solve puzzles.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.484
Why puzzles?

15:01.568 --> 15:05.780
We don't know. But Dr Channard thinks
it might be a good thing.

15:05.906 --> 15:10.368
Maybe, beneath her withdrawal,
she's putting something in order.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.746
Or opening doors.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.540
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.210
Anyway, let's concentrate on you
for the moment.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.588
I want you to take a couple of these.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.925
I'm not crazy, Kyle.

15:25.008 --> 15:28.678
- Those aren't gonna help.
- They're only to help you.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.722
Sleep.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.185
Just doing my job.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.372
<i>How are we today?
Better? Good, good, good.</i>

18:02.290 --> 18:04.334
Pleasant day.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.920
Pleasant day.

18:10.173 --> 18:14.052
105 years and he still
doesn't know my name.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.400
Let me go. I don't wanna go.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.268
Get 'em off me.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.356
Please! Get them off me!

19:23.121 --> 19:25.623
Kirsty? Kirsty, are you all right?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.419
I had a visitor.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.713
What? Here? Who?

19:34.465 --> 19:36.593
It was my father.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.429
He's alone and he's still suffering.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.100
Kirsty, your father's dead.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.812
My father's dead and he's alone
and he is still suffering.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.902
Dr Channard. I'll get Dr Channard.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.279
You take it easy. I'm sure he can help.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.991
He got a ticket to hell?

20:09.334 --> 20:12.420
Officer Kucich.
Yes, Dr Channard.

20:12.503 --> 20:15.840
You've spoken to Ronson? Yes, that's right.

20:15.924 --> 20:20.303
The mattress. No.
I'll meet you by the side entrance.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.472
No, no. My house.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.016
Yes, let me make that clear.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.061
The house. Not the hospital.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.230
Yes. Fine.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.315
Thank you.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.777
Dr Channard?

20:39.489 --> 20:41.449
This.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.702
All must have been going on for ever.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.165
Kirsty?

20:49.249 --> 20:51.417
The part I know about,

20:52.418 --> 20:54.712
the part that destroyed my family,

20:56.214 --> 20:58.800
that must have started with my Uncle Frank.

20:59.425 --> 21:04.180
- I'm brother Frank.
<i>- It was him and my father's wife.</i>

21:09.602 --> 21:11.729
<i>It was Frank and Julia.</i>

21:13.481 --> 21:16.317
<i>I don't know when but they...</i>

21:17.318 --> 21:19.821
<i>they must have been with each other.</i>

21:28.871 --> 21:30.999
<i>But there's more.</i>

21:31.791 --> 21:33.835
<i>It was the box.</i>

21:35.378 --> 21:37.380
<i>It was a puzzle box.</i>

21:39.132 --> 21:41.467
<i>And Frank must have solved it.</i>

21:42.218 --> 21:44.012
<i>It was a gate way.</i>

21:44.137 --> 21:46.889
<i>- Hell was what he wanted.</i>

21:47.015 --> 21:49.100
<i>And hell was what he got.</i>

21:57.191 --> 21:59.193
<i>Some how,</i>

22:00.153 --> 22:02.196
<i>I don't know,</i>

22:03.114 --> 22:05.283
<i>Frank came back to life.</i>

22:19.047 --> 22:22.008
<i>It was Julia. That bitch.</i>

22:22.091 --> 22:24.177
<i>She brought him men</i>

22:24.260 --> 22:26.095
<i>to make him stronger.</i>

22:27.513 --> 22:30.600
<i>So she could have him again.</i>

22:32.769 --> 22:35.813
Kirsty, it's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.232
- No.
- You remember.

22:38.316 --> 22:41.194
- Come to Daddy.
- Get the fuck off of me!

22:47.784 --> 22:52.580
<i>I made a deal.
I'd lead them to Frank, if they left me alone.</i>

22:52.705 --> 22:55.416
<i>- I ran to warn Daddy to get out.</i>
- Daddy!

22:55.500 --> 23:00.129
<i>Out of that house. When I got there.
Oh, God. They'd murdered him.</i>

23:01.798 --> 23:05.718
<i>Frank and Julia, they'd taken his skin</i>

23:07.303 --> 23:09.514
<i>and given it to Frank.</i>

23:09.597 --> 23:12.850
Come to Daddy.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.815
<i>Frank betrayed her
and left her to the Cenobites</i>

23:18.898 --> 23:21.526
- It's nothing personal, baby.

23:21.651 --> 23:24.028
<i>She dies on that mattress</i>

23:24.153 --> 23:27.657
<i>- And the Cenobites came.</i>

23:41.337 --> 23:43.714
Do you believe me?

23:43.798 --> 23:45.842
Am I crazy?

23:46.717 --> 23:49.971
That is not a word I choose
to employ, Kirsty.

23:50.054 --> 23:56.561
But clearly, there is much we must discuss.
Much we must investigate.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.813
Much I have to do.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.704
Weird.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.555
Fucking weird.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.150
Jesus Christ.

26:11.654 --> 26:14.699
Jesus Christ!

26:29.088 --> 26:32.341
Get off me!

26:35.636 --> 26:37.346
Get off me!

26:39.599 --> 26:43.060
- Get off me!

26:49.984 --> 26:52.153
Please!

26:52.236 --> 26:54.280
Get them off of me!

27:06.542 --> 27:10.880
"Children of the vortex?
Puberty linked with psychic phenomena."

27:24.477 --> 27:28.064
Jesus, he must have been into this shit
for years.

27:36.364 --> 27:38.240
What is he doing?

27:39.367 --> 27:41.410
What is this?

27:41.494 --> 27:44.455
- Get them off me.

27:45.539 --> 27:48.584
Please!

27:48.668 --> 27:50.711
Come, Mr Browning.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.805
Please.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.641
Please.

28:11.107 --> 28:13.275
Get them off me.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.739
Please, sit down.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.885
Get them off me!

29:42.573 --> 29:45.075
Get them off me!

30:01.175 --> 30:05.304
Get them off me!

31:02.653 --> 31:04.780
No!

31:16.333 --> 31:20.379
Help! Help me, please!

32:03.172 --> 32:05.215
Help me.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.763
Help me.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.952
Don't be scared of me.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.839
Well?

35:01.934 --> 35:03.977
I'm cold.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.920
Well?

35:30.003 --> 35:32.673
Yes. Yes.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.385
- You look.
- Strange?

35:38.679 --> 35:40.639
Surreal?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.643
- Nightmarish?
- No. No.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.313
You look.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.283
Wine.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.773
There.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.077
Well?

37:26.078 --> 37:28.038
Well?

38:59.838 --> 39:01.923
Now all we need

39:02.007 --> 39:03.967
is skin.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.106
What's wrong with you?

39:21.610 --> 39:23.653
It's all true.

39:25.322 --> 39:27.657
Get dressed. I gotta get you out of here.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.831
- Shit!
- I'll get you clothes.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.377
I can do that. I'm a doctor.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.509
She was horrible.

39:45.634 --> 39:48.095
She had no skin.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.138
No skin.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.058
Julia doesn't deserve to come back.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.187
It's not fair.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.278
I need that box.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.867
Channard has boxes.

40:11.535 --> 40:14.287
- Like in my story?
- Yeah, I think so.

40:14.371 --> 40:18.041
- I'm going.
- Wait a minute. What do you mean?

40:18.125 --> 40:20.669
To the house? Are you crazy?

40:21.503 --> 40:24.047
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert.

40:24.131 --> 40:26.425
Look, think about this.

40:26.508 --> 40:29.719
Kyle, when I think, I hurt.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.097
OK? Now I'm going.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.225
- Why?
- Because I'm going to get my father.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.897
Two seconds. Just two seconds.
Don't move.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.820
OK, let's go.

40:47.404 --> 40:49.698
Kyle, you don't have to do this.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.329
I know.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.655
Kirsty.

43:35.739 --> 43:39.075
We're not gonna do anything
until I check the house.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.537
Wait for me here, all right?

44:17.113 --> 44:19.240
I'm sorry I startled you.

44:19.366 --> 44:23.370
I had to stop you going in there
because I knew you'd cry out.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.873
It's just terrible.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.543
Is it still here?

44:33.630 --> 44:35.674
I don't know.

45:35.483 --> 45:37.485
Was I right?

45:38.111 --> 45:40.155
Is it terrible?

45:42.490 --> 45:44.451
Yes.

45:45.493 --> 45:47.579
This is terrible.

45:49.539 --> 45:52.584
Oh, you poor boy. You look awful.

45:55.295 --> 45:57.338
Come here.

46:07.056 --> 46:09.142
Come to Mother.

46:17.192 --> 46:19.152
What's your name?

46:19.235 --> 46:20.862
Kyle.

46:20.945 --> 46:23.031
I'm Julia.

46:57.524 --> 46:59.484
Kyle?

47:15.625 --> 47:17.585
Kyle?

47:38.356 --> 47:40.400
Not again.

47:44.445 --> 47:46.698
Kirsty,

47:46.781 --> 47:49.200
you have surprisingly good taste in men.

47:50.410 --> 47:53.037
They didn't tell you, did they, Kirsty?

47:53.162 --> 47:56.499
They changed the rules of the fairy tale.

47:56.583 --> 47:59.919
I'm no longer just the wicked stepmother.

48:00.003 --> 48:02.547
Now, I'm the evil queen.

48:02.672 --> 48:05.049
- So come on.
- No!

48:05.174 --> 48:07.302
Take your best shot, Snow White.

48:10.763 --> 48:12.891
Julia?

48:15.852 --> 48:18.021
Now it's my turn.

50:13.261 --> 50:16.597
- Your sure this is what you want?
- It's what I've always wanted.

50:16.723 --> 50:19.684
I have to see. I have to know.

51:11.986 --> 51:14.113
She's done it.

51:16.824 --> 51:18.785
She certainly has.

51:24.457 --> 51:26.459
It's coming.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.212
It certainly is.

53:03.181 --> 53:05.141
Wait.

53:18.196 --> 53:20.198
- No.
- No?

53:20.323 --> 53:22.366
No.

53:22.450 --> 53:25.494
It is not hands that call us.

53:27.121 --> 53:29.707
It is desire.

55:03.718 --> 55:05.720
Oh, God.

55:21.444 --> 55:23.612
Daddy! Where are you?

55:28.284 --> 55:32.038
- Daddy? Daddy, where are you?

55:32.121 --> 55:36.500
Say something. I don't know where you are.
Daddy, I'm coming.

56:07.907 --> 56:10.868
Help my daughter.

56:24.465 --> 56:27.635
Help my daughter.

56:27.760 --> 56:30.596
Mommy! Mommy!

56:30.679 --> 56:33.641
Help my daughter.

57:56.140 --> 57:58.100
Mommy.

58:25.628 --> 58:28.339
Oh, God, no!

58:30.966 --> 58:33.636
Somebody please help me!

58:45.314 --> 58:48.776
Ah, Kirsty, we thought we'd lost you.

58:48.901 --> 58:50.694
So sweet of you to come back.

58:50.819 --> 58:54.698
How can it send us back, child?
We're already here.

58:54.782 --> 58:56.659
And so are you.

59:07.294 --> 59:10.256
- I didn't open a box.
- Didn't open a box.

59:10.381 --> 59:14.218
And what was it last time?
Didn't know what the box was.

59:14.301 --> 59:16.720
And yet we do keep finding each other,
don't we?

59:16.845 --> 59:21.809
Oh, Kirsty, so eager to play.

59:21.892 --> 59:24.228
So reluctant to admit it.

59:24.311 --> 59:27.356
- Perhaps you're teasing us.
- Are you teasing us?

59:28.023 --> 59:30.192
I've come for my father!

59:35.155 --> 59:39.410
But he is in his own hell, child,
and quite unreachable.

59:39.535 --> 59:41.328
I don't believe you!

59:45.165 --> 59:47.042
But it's true.

59:47.126 --> 59:51.422
He is in his own hell,
just as you are in yours.

59:51.547 --> 59:53.173
And what about you?

59:53.299 --> 59:57.636
- We have no more surprises.
- We've always been here.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:01.557
But please, feel free. Explore.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:08.647
We have eternity to know your flesh.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.525
Flesh, flesh, flesh.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.420
Help me.

01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:15.381
Come.

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:18.050
I have such sights to show you.

01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:12.354
You must have opened the box, Tiffany.

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:16.275
You've got to close it.
You know how the puzzle works. Get us out!

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.945
Look. We're alone in all of this

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.865
and we have to help each other.

01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:26.201
We have to help each other.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.290
Yeah?

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.460
Yeah?

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.672
Yeah.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.336
Oh, my God.

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:21.799
No.

01:03:21.882 --> 01:03:23.842
This is mine.

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:28.013
The god that sent me back,

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:31.350
the god I serve in this world and yours,

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:35.521
the god of flesh, hunger and desire,

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:41.151
my god, Leviathan, Lord of the Labyrinth.

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:00.921
Help me, Doctor. Help my daughter.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.881
Can you help her?

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:05.759
But this is what you wanted.

01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:10.138
This is what you wanted to see.
This is what you wanted to know.

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:13.267
And here it is.

01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:16.436
Leviathan.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:26.530
Help me!

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:29.700
Why do you think
I was allowed to come back?

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:34.413
It wanted souls.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:36.748
And I brought you.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.212
And you wanted to know.

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:48.468
Now you know.

01:04:49.845 --> 01:04:51.305
I wanted everything.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:54.808
Now everybody's happy.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.818
Goodbye, Doctor.

01:05:30.052 --> 01:05:32.763
The house. My father's house.

01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:37.851
Tiffany. Tiffany.

01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:40.646
Um, I'm sorry, but I have to go in there.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.483
Look. I want you to wait for me.

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:48.111
But if I'm not back soon, real soon,

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:51.657
I want you to get out
and I want you to get home.

01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:20.263
Daddy?

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.448
Take me! Take me!

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.461
What's the matter, Kirsty?
It's only Frank.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:54.464
- It's only Uncle Frank.
- Oh, no.

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:56.299
Didn't you get my message?

01:08:58.218 --> 01:09:00.720
Oh, Kirsty.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:05.767
So ripe in your confusions,
so. luscious in your pain.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.853
I want Daddy!

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.895
Oh, come on, Kirsty. Grow up.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:13.149
When you're dead, you're fucking dead.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.443
- Oh!

01:09:15.527 --> 01:09:17.487
No!

01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:23.743
Don't be naughty, Kirsty,

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:26.078
or I'll have to punish you for it.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.122
Huh?

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:30.167
Perhaps you'd like that, huh?

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.046
Now, would you like that?

01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:41.678
Oh, don't be shy, beautiful.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:44.680
- Ghosts aren't jealous.

01:09:46.308 --> 01:09:50.729
- This is my hell. They're here to tease me.
- Take me!

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:53.732
They promise forever and never deliver.

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:57.027
- Aah!
- That's why I sent for you, Kirsty.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.838
OK. OK.

01:10:16.922 --> 01:10:18.673
Don't hurt me. I'll do anything.

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:32.687
I'd rather burn.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.274
No!

01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:47.827
Kirsty!

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:06.054
No!

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.974
Not my. Aaah!

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:16.690
No! No! Not my face!

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:27.784
Well, well.

01:11:33.707 --> 01:11:36.501
- Family reunion?
- Julia.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:40.380
Frank.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.966
- I knew you'd come.
- You knew?

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:46.761
You're a girl
who always keeps her promises.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.265
Oh, I do.

01:11:56.354 --> 01:12:00.025
- I do.
- I know just how much I mean to you.

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:04.821
Come here.

01:12:05.739 --> 01:12:07.699
Kiss me.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:10.535
And then we'll have a real family reunion.

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:16.708
Come here. You belong to me.

01:12:46.071 --> 01:12:47.906
- Shit!

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.660
Nothing personal, babe.

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:15.016
Which way, Tiffany?

01:13:20.939 --> 01:13:22.857
Hang on!

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:26.027
Hang on!

01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:11.823
And to think.

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:13.867
I hesitated.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.078
You never could hold onto anything
for very long, could you, Kirsty?

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.131
Tiffany! Reach for my arm!

01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:14.802
Reach for my arm!

01:15:14.928 --> 01:15:18.848
Tiffany! Tiffany!

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:33.988
No! No! Tiffany, don't trust her!

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:37.492
Don't trust her! Tiffany, no!

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:41.204
No!

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:36.467
Daddy, I'm sorry.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.888
I'm so sorry.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:20.928
Tiffany, we're getting out of here.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.407
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.120
There's so many of them.

01:17:57.382 --> 01:17:59.926
The doctor. is in.

01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:02.303
Oh, shit.

01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:16.609
I recommend.

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:18.569
Amputation.

01:18:50.143 --> 01:18:53.312
Oh. No boxes.

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:57.692
- Such a shame.
- No more delays, Kirsty.

01:18:57.817 --> 01:19:02.363
No more teasing. Time to play.

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:05.199
Time to play.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:10.288
- Wait.
- No more deals, Kirsty.

01:19:11.164 --> 01:19:16.085
It is your flesh we want to experience,
not your skill at bargaining.

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:18.713
No deals.

01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:21.090
Just information.

01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:23.760
Just information!

01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:26.053
Go on.

01:19:26.179 --> 01:19:28.014
But trick us again, child,

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:34.103
and your suffering will be legendary,
even in hell.

01:19:41.027 --> 01:19:43.404
What is this?

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:52.079
Someone else you think escaped us?
Like Frank?

01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:54.707
No, this one didn't escape.

01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:56.626
It's you.

01:19:58.795 --> 01:20:01.214
- Nonsense. I.
- It's you!

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:05.051
You haven't always been this way.

01:20:05.885 --> 01:20:08.596
You were human.

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:10.264
Remember.

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:14.060
Remember all your confusion.

01:20:15.353 --> 01:20:17.313
- Think!
- Enough.

01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:20.191
Wait.

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:29.325
I. remember.

01:20:32.537 --> 01:20:34.455
You were all. human.

01:20:44.841 --> 01:20:46.717
Tiffany!

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:52.348
Come.

01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:00.648
Come.

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:03.860
Tiffany.

01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:08.906
I'm your doctor.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.659
I'm here to help you.

01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:21.002
Aaah. Good.

01:21:21.127 --> 01:21:22.712
A fight.

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:26.525
I'm taking over.

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:29.111
This operation.

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:33.699
And you girls will be my first patients.

01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:23.165
Aaaah!

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.267
I have to go back.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.310
I have to finish the puzzle.

01:23:43.394 --> 01:23:47.398
- Tiffany, what are you talking --
- They remembered and they got better.

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:34.403
Tiffany, what are you doing?

01:24:34.487 --> 01:24:37.490
What is this thing? What does it do?

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:10.648
Oh, my God.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.682
It's all right, my child.
I'm going to help you now.

01:25:44.807 --> 01:25:49.061
Can you help her?
These puzzles are consuming her life.

01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:52.231
Help me, Doctor.
Can you help my daughter?

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:54.024
Can you help her?

01:25:54.108 --> 01:25:55.609
Mm!

01:26:00.865 --> 01:26:03.284
Mommy! Mommy!

01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:06.537
Mommy! Mommy!

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:09.123
No!

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:14.461
Tiffany, I see now. It's a puzzle, isn't it?

01:26:14.587 --> 01:26:16.589
It's a puzzle.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.935
Tiffany!

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:18.984
Our girl.

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:20.945
And how are we feeling today?

01:27:30.204 --> 01:27:33.082
You have your whole lives behind you now.

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:37.836
No anesthetic at hand. Shame.

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:02.278
Surgery is open, Tiffany.

01:28:04.822 --> 01:28:07.408
What is today's agenda?

01:28:07.533 --> 01:28:09.952
Ah, yes.

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:12.454
Evisceration.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.117
I knew you would come back.

01:29:44.254 --> 01:29:47.174
Your case is closed, Tiffany.

01:29:48.175 --> 01:29:50.803
I'm afraid it's terminal.

01:30:39.143 --> 01:30:41.103
Trust me.

01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:40.621
Kirsty.

01:31:59.765 --> 01:32:03.268
Tiffany! We've got to get out of here!

01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:35.837
Whose is all this shit?

01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:38.965
Not our problem.

01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:01.405
Hey, take a look at this.

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:58.295
What is your pleasure, sir?
