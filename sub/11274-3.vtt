WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:05.622
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:07.924 --> 00:08.925
Hey, Mr. Clavin's back.

00:09.426 --> 00:10.427
Whatta you say, Woody?

00:10.427 --> 00:11.928
How was your trip to Expo?

00:11.928 --> 00:13.430
Oh, a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.431
I tell ya.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.932
You know, no ears have heard,

00:15.932 --> 00:17.934
no eyes have seen the
wonders I've experienced

00:17.934 --> 00:19.436
these past two weeks in Canada.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.439
If I died right now,
I'd be a happy person.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.941
You wouldn't be the only one.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.444
Hey, uh, Normie, you should have seen

00:27.444 --> 00:29.946
this 3-D movie they had
about life in Vancouver.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.448
You know, with those glasses on,

00:31.448 --> 00:33.316
you felt like you were really there.

00:33.316 --> 00:36.653
You were there, Cliff.

00:36.653 --> 00:37.654
I've been readin' up on Expo.

00:37.654 --> 00:39.155
Did you catch that bullet
train they got there?

00:39.155 --> 00:40.657
No, I guess I missed that one.

00:40.657 --> 00:43.159
Did you see the Great Hall of Ramses?

00:43.159 --> 00:47.163
Uh, no, no, I guess that
slid right by me... yeah.

00:47.163 --> 00:48.665
Uh, how about the U.S. space exhibit?

00:48.665 --> 00:52.052
No.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.553
Chinese acrobats?

00:53.553 --> 00:54.554
Uh-uh.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.807
SAM: Hey, Cliff! How was Expo?

00:57.807 --> 01:00.643
A major disappointment, Sam.

01:03.563 --> 01:07.100
(piano plays)

01:07.100 --> 01:09.569
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:09.569 --> 01:12.572
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:12.572 --> 01:15.575
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:15.575 --> 01:19.079
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:19.079 --> 01:23.950
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:23.950 --> 01:26.786
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:26.786 --> 01:32.292
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:32.292 --> 01:36.796
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:36.796 --> 01:39.299
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:39.299 --> 01:41.801
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:41.801 --> 01:47.307
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:47.307 --> 01:49.809
? You want to go where people know ?

01:49.809 --> 01:52.312
? People are all the same ?

01:52.312 --> 01:56.316
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:15.585 --> 02:17.554
Sam, Yeah.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.055
I need a Dewar's rocks and
a Grand Marnier, please.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.557
Comin' up.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.558
Did you have a chance

02:21.558 --> 02:23.059
to look at the catalog I left for you?

02:23.059 --> 02:24.060
What catalog?

02:24.561 --> 02:26.813
This catalog with the
silverware patterns.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.098
To go with our china and fine crystal.

02:29.098 --> 02:30.600
Sam, we have to make a decision,

02:30.600 --> 02:32.602
if we're going to be registered.

02:32.602 --> 02:33.603
Some people in the bar

02:33.603 --> 02:35.488
are starting to ask about gifts.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.907
Who? What people? Where?

02:37.907 --> 02:39.409
Aw, Norm.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.662
I just asked if ya had
to give one, all right?

02:44.948 --> 02:48.368
Anyway, Sam, should
we have a big wedding?

02:48.368 --> 02:49.369
No, no,

02:49.369 --> 02:52.755
I think we should have a military one.

02:52.755 --> 02:55.041
All 21 guns aimed at the bride.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.347
Hey, Fitz. Still Irish?

03:01.347 --> 03:02.599
As Paddy's pig.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.550
All right.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.435
Make it the usual, Sam.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.270
SAM: Uh, drinks for everybody.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.055
(cheering, applause)

03:09.055 --> 03:11.774
So, uh, who's the geezer?

03:11.774 --> 03:13.059
That's Mr. Fitzgerald.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.061
He's come in every day
for the past two weeks

03:15.562 --> 03:17.063
and bought drinks for everybody.

03:17.063 --> 03:17.947
Yeah?

03:17.947 --> 03:19.449
Gee, he's a heck of a guy.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.950
You know, I think, in many ways,

03:20.950 --> 03:22.952
Mr. Fitzgerald and I are alike.

03:22.952 --> 03:26.456
We both come here seeking
warmth and camaraderie.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.957
A safe haven from the outside world.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.959
You know, a place where
you can always feel welcome.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.462
Excuse me, pal, you're on my stool.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.464
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.465
I didn't realize.

03:38.334 --> 03:41.170
Eh, look at him, huh?

03:41.170 --> 03:43.006
Mr. Big Shot over there.

03:43.006 --> 03:45.258
What does he think he is,
a "bon vivone" or something?

03:45.258 --> 03:46.259
(chuckles)

03:46.259 --> 03:48.761
He's about the richest guy
you'll ever meet, Cliff.

03:48.761 --> 03:49.762
Why don't we join him?

03:49.762 --> 03:52.015
CARLA: Hey, Fitzie,

03:52.015 --> 03:54.317
thanks for that $20 tip last night.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.320
But I don't want ya gettin'
the wrong idea about me.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.823
Carla, I know that your
favors are not for sale.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.744
See? That's what I mean
about the wrong idea.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.748
Eh, howdy. Cliff Clavin.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.751
Duncan Fitzgerald. Nice to meet you.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.753
Yeah, so, uh, you, uh, you
live in the neighborhood?

04:13.753 --> 04:15.255
Well, I just moved here.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.257
I was originally from Michigan.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.757
The, uh, Wolverine State, huh?

04:18.757 --> 04:21.761
Interesting, interesting.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.763
So, I hear you're stinkin' rich.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.267
Real smooth, Cliff. Very smooth.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.771
Uh, Fitz is actually kind of
a minor celebrity, I guess.

04:31.771 --> 04:32.772
He invented a little something

04:32.772 --> 04:34.274
we call the, uh, the refill, right?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.725
Is that right? No, no, no, no.

04:35.725 --> 04:37.727
It wasn't the refill. It was...

04:37.727 --> 04:40.229
The metal vapor input valve.

04:40.229 --> 04:42.732
It's, uh, used on most, uh, commercial

04:42.732 --> 04:44.734
and military jet engines.

04:44.734 --> 04:45.735
Oh, yeah.

04:45.735 --> 04:48.237
I never step on a plane
without lookin' right out

04:48.237 --> 04:50.239
on that wing and see if
there's one out there.

04:50.239 --> 04:52.742
Actually, it's located in the tail.

04:52.742 --> 04:53.743
Uh, well, yeah, yeah.

04:53.743 --> 04:55.745
It's, uh, 'cause if
ya saw it on the wing,

04:55.745 --> 04:58.247
then you'd know you were
in a lot of trouble, huh?

04:59.749 --> 05:02.251
NORM: As long as we're
talkin' business here,

05:02.251 --> 05:03.252
who, uh, who does your books, sir?

05:03.252 --> 05:04.253
McCann and Williams.

05:04.253 --> 05:05.505
McCann and Williams.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.306
Uh, can I talk to you about that

05:06.306 --> 05:07.307
over a game of darts?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.558
FITZGERALD: Sure.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.893
I think I could do
better than those guys.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.395
What do you like best about them?

05:12.895 --> 05:14.897
Well, I must say I like
their aggressiveness.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.399
(chuckles)

05:16.399 --> 05:17.900
Sir, I think I can
be just as aggressive.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.901
I doubt that.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.403
Yeah, you're probably right.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.775
He's a great guy.

05:25.775 --> 05:28.077
Yeah, it's too bad that we
seem to be his only family.

05:28.077 --> 05:28.945
No wife?

05:28.945 --> 05:29.912
He's a widower.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.280
CARLA: Boy, I'm tellin' you,

05:31.280 --> 05:32.615
with all the millions he's got,

05:32.615 --> 05:33.616
if I was an old bat,

05:33.616 --> 05:35.118
I'd snatch him up in a minute.

05:35.118 --> 05:37.253
Ma.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.705
What's that, Cliff?

05:38.705 --> 05:41.674
Huh? Oh, uh, well, you
know, my ma's been dyin'

05:41.674 --> 05:45.678
to come down here for, uh, years
to meet all the guys at the bar.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.931
Hey! Tonight's a good
a night as any, huh?

05:48.931 --> 05:50.717
I wish I'd thought of that.

05:51.217 --> 05:53.219
I'd try to get my
mother down here first,

05:53.219 --> 05:55.722
but it takes a forklift
to get her off the couch.

06:02.311 --> 06:03.312
Hey, Clavin,

06:03.312 --> 06:05.281
Fitz really wants to leave.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.783
Yeah, yeah, she's comin' now.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.151
Just hang on a minute.

06:08.151 --> 06:09.485
Hold him there.

06:11.487 --> 06:12.488
Hi, there.

06:12.488 --> 06:13.373
Ma,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.324
what took you so long to get down here?

06:15.324 --> 06:18.828
Well, I wanted to look
my best for your friends.

06:18.828 --> 06:21.080
And this is two hours' worth?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.382
Uh,

06:22.382 --> 06:23.883
Ma,

06:23.883 --> 06:26.252
this is Cheers.

06:26.252 --> 06:27.754
Yeah, this is the odor

06:27.754 --> 06:29.756
I'm always washing out of your shirts.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.641
Well, come on in, Ma.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.509
I, I want to introduce you

06:33.509 --> 06:36.396
to the finest, greatest
bunch of pals a guy could have

06:36.396 --> 06:39.399
anywhere on the Earth. I'm tellin' ya.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.401
Everybody, this is
Ma. Ma, this everybody.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.821
Ma, you just stand right
there for a few seconds, huh?

06:44.821 --> 06:46.689
I'll be right back.

06:46.689 --> 06:48.491
So I guess Mr. Clavin's
told you a lot about us, huh?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.910
No, actually, Clifford doesn't talk much

06:50.910 --> 06:52.412
around the house.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.696
That Cliff?

06:53.696 --> 06:55.164
That's right.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.916
Some days, not a peep.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.618
Of course, the same thing occurs

06:58.618 --> 07:00.420
in nature, too.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.790
It's a little-known
fact that arctic wolves

07:03.790 --> 07:06.092
that remained in the den too long

07:06.092 --> 07:09.095
exhibited a tendency to be reticent

07:09.095 --> 07:09.962
in their howling.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.464
Ah.

07:11.464 --> 07:12.465
Now, when I read that...

07:12.465 --> 07:13.466
Hey, Ma, Ma, Ma, come on.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.968
You're boring the pants
off these people here.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.354
Well, look who's here.

07:18.354 --> 07:19.722
Ma, I'd like you to meet

07:19.722 --> 07:22.558
a dear, dear, old, very
close friend of mine.

07:22.558 --> 07:25.061
Mr. Fitzgerald, this
is my ma, Esther Clavin.

07:25.061 --> 07:26.312
Nice to meet you.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.815
Duncan here's originally
from Michigan, Ma.

07:28.815 --> 07:29.699
Oh.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.483
Have a seat.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.484
Yeah, my ma's been

07:31.484 --> 07:32.452
to your home state.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.453
Oh, really?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.456
No, I've been to Maine and Montana,

07:36.456 --> 07:37.957
but not Michigan.

07:37.957 --> 07:38.958
(forced laugh)

07:38.958 --> 07:39.959
Isn't that fascinating, huh?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.462
Perhaps, if you live in a cave.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.464
(laughs)

07:44.464 --> 07:45.965
Isn't she a firecracker?

07:51.337 --> 07:54.257
Uh, say, Mrs. Clavin, uh, did you know

07:54.257 --> 07:59.262
that Fitz over there invented a
technical gizmo on jet airplanes?

07:59.262 --> 08:00.229
Oh, really?

08:00.229 --> 08:02.231
Yeah, yeah, what a coincidence, huh, Ma?

08:02.231 --> 08:04.734
You've, uh, you've ridden
in jet planes before,

08:04.734 --> 08:05.735
haven't you?

08:05.735 --> 08:09.238
No, I walked to Montana.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.740
(giggles)

08:10.740 --> 08:12.742
Normie, I'm sinkin' fast.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.245
Uh, correct me if I'm wrong,

08:16.245 --> 08:18.247
but didn't you two share a war together?

08:18.247 --> 08:20.249
Hey, yeah.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.035
That's, that's right.

08:23.035 --> 08:25.037
Uh, Ma, where were
you during the big one?

08:25.538 --> 08:28.424
Clifford, you know I was in New York.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.793
I worked at the USO on 42nd Street.

08:30.793 --> 08:33.296
I was in charge of table games.

08:33.296 --> 08:35.681
Universal checker championships,

08:35.681 --> 08:38.433
Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:00 p.m.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.219
Oh, my goodness!

08:40.219 --> 08:41.470
Ladies red,

08:41.470 --> 08:42.938
gentlemen black. Right.

08:42.938 --> 08:43.890
Your host...

08:43.890 --> 08:45.391
BOTH: Bobby Holloway.

08:45.391 --> 08:46.275
(both laugh)

08:46.275 --> 08:47.777
That's right! That's right.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.279
Bobby Holloway.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.647
Oh, Bobby Holloway.

08:51.647 --> 08:53.699
ESTHER: Oh, Bobby Holloway.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.535
Isn't this beautiful, huh?

08:56.035 --> 08:58.654
Hey, why don't you two
finish up your reminiscing

08:58.654 --> 09:00.039
over some nice baked sea bass, huh?

09:00.039 --> 09:02.408
That's the, uh, special
up there at Melville's.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.409
Well, I could use a bite.

09:03.409 --> 09:07.413
Well, I guess I'm feeling
kind of peckish, too.

09:07.413 --> 09:10.416
Great. Hey, and listen, it's my treat.

09:10.917 --> 09:14.420
Now, I absolutely, positively,
insist-- dinner is on me.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.422
Oh, I can take care of it, Cliff.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.424
You got it!

09:18.424 --> 09:21.928
Oh, what lovely buttons.

09:21.928 --> 09:25.431
Did you know that buttons
on a man's jacket sleeve

09:25.431 --> 09:27.433
have absolutely no purpose?

09:27.433 --> 09:30.436
They originated on the
uniforms of Napoleon's army

09:30.436 --> 09:31.938
when he discovered

09:31.938 --> 09:34.440
that his soldiers were
using their sleeves

09:34.440 --> 09:36.192
to wipe their noses.

09:36.192 --> 09:40.529
Oh, she's gonna flap her gums
all the way to the poorhouse.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.337
Hey, Cliff!

09:48.337 --> 09:49.338
Hey, Sammy!

09:49.839 --> 09:51.841
Have you heard the latest
in the, uh, Ma-Fitz romance?

09:51.841 --> 09:53.092
No, no. What's goin' on?

09:53.092 --> 09:55.378
Yeah, they're celebratin'
their first week together

09:55.378 --> 09:56.879
with a picnic on the Charles.

09:56.879 --> 09:57.880
Whoa, the Charles!

09:57.880 --> 10:00.383
Boy, that's the make-out
capital of the world.

10:00.383 --> 10:01.884
And if he does as well as I do,

10:01.884 --> 10:03.886
there's gonna be a lotta panting

10:03.886 --> 10:05.137
and rolling around and...

10:07.473 --> 10:08.474
...shopping.

10:08.474 --> 10:11.360
There's a mall right
next to the Charles.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.280
SAM: Oh, yeah.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.282
Speaking of the devil...

10:16.282 --> 10:17.283
Oh, hey, Ma, Fitz!

10:17.283 --> 10:20.286
I thought you two were
on the way to the Charles.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.787
Well, we are.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.289
Are you busy?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.658
What's up, Ma?

10:25.658 --> 10:27.543
Sit down, son.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.247
Clifford,

10:31.247 --> 10:34.750
now I know how much
your father meant to you,

10:34.750 --> 10:36.752
and I know it's going

10:36.752 --> 10:39.755
to take a while for
you to adjust to this,

10:39.755 --> 10:41.257
to having a new father.

10:41.257 --> 10:42.758
Daddy!

10:45.761 --> 10:47.263
ESTHER: My God!

10:47.263 --> 10:51.267
Clifford, I haven't even
kissed him on the lips.

10:51.267 --> 10:52.268
Hey, everybody!

10:52.268 --> 10:53.769
Wedding bells at the Clavin compound!

10:53.769 --> 10:56.272
(cheering)

10:56.272 --> 10:57.773
When's the happy day, folks?

10:57.773 --> 10:59.659
Tomorrow.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.110
CLIFF: Sammy, champagne!

11:01.110 --> 11:03.112
Oh, Duncan, I'm gonna throw you

11:03.112 --> 11:05.614
the biggest bachelor
bash Beantown's ever seen!

11:05.614 --> 11:07.616
Normie, call all my friends.

11:07.616 --> 11:10.119
I think he moved.

11:10.119 --> 11:12.121
Well, then call all yours.

11:12.121 --> 11:14.123
Woody, I'm gonna make you
entertainment chairman, huh?

11:14.123 --> 11:15.124
Hot dog!

11:15.124 --> 11:17.626
Get on the horn there,
call the Parker House

11:17.626 --> 11:19.512
and, uh, order me up
their fanciest room.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.346
You got it.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.349
Wow, my first bachelor party.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.350
No dates, right?

11:24.350 --> 11:27.269
No.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.772
Hey, uh, congratulations there, Fitzie.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.273
Thank you.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.276
Listen, if things don't
work out with Esther,

11:34.276 --> 11:36.278
here is my mother's number, okay?

11:36.278 --> 11:38.280
Let it ring ten or 15 minutes.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.148
She'll get there.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.070
Oh, you two.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.571
I'm so happy for you.

11:45.571 --> 11:46.572
You know, Cliff,

11:46.572 --> 11:48.574
your mother is the first person

11:48.574 --> 11:51.077
who's ever really loved me for me

11:51.077 --> 11:52.578
instead of my checkbook.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.080
Oh, Ma...

11:54.080 --> 11:55.081
That's why I'm donating

11:55.081 --> 11:57.083
the bulk of my fortune to charity.

12:06.692 --> 12:10.012
CLIFF: Giving... money... away.

12:10.012 --> 12:12.298
Actually it was your mother's idea.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.799
Ma's?

12:13.799 --> 12:18.304
I didn't want Duncan to have
any doubts about my feelings.

12:18.304 --> 12:19.805
How are you two gonna live?

12:19.805 --> 12:21.807
Well, I'm not gonna give it all away.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.809
I'll keep enough for the
two of us to be comfortable.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.312
We're simple people-- we
don't need much to live.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.313
ESTHER: And you're

12:27.313 --> 12:28.814
self-sufficient, not to mention

12:28.814 --> 12:31.317
that postal pension you're
always bragging about.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.319
WOODY: Mr. Clavin,
it's the Parker House.

12:33.319 --> 12:34.820
They want to know if you want

12:34.820 --> 12:36.822
the Embassy Court or the Grand Ballroom.

12:36.822 --> 12:39.825
Give me that! Give me that phone!

12:39.825 --> 12:41.827
Fraternity prank.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.829
What, are you nuts, Woody?

12:43.829 --> 12:45.331
I can't afford a party.

12:45.331 --> 12:48.334
Parties are for rich people. I'm poor.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.835
I've always been poor.

12:49.835 --> 12:50.836
I'll always be poor.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.838
I'm gonna die poor!

12:52.838 --> 12:55.641
I'd like to resign as
entertainment chairman.

12:57.092 --> 12:59.094
Listen, I don't know
how to say this to you

12:59.094 --> 13:01.347
without offending you, but you're
behaving like a class-A jerk.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.181
Oh, am I?

13:02.681 --> 13:04.183
Well, what have I got to celebrate?

13:04.183 --> 13:05.684
SAM: Well, for one thing,

13:05.684 --> 13:07.186
your mother's met a very nice man

13:07.186 --> 13:08.938
who's making her very happy.

13:08.938 --> 13:09.772
And?

13:09.772 --> 13:11.657
Cliff!

13:12.408 --> 13:15.411
Well... all right.

13:15.411 --> 13:17.413
All right, of course you're right.

13:17.413 --> 13:19.281
(Cliff sighs)

13:19.281 --> 13:22.585
I guess I just forgot
how much Ma means to me.

13:22.585 --> 13:25.087
Yeah, I'll have the party for her sake.

13:25.087 --> 13:28.090
It'll just have to be
the economy version.

13:28.090 --> 13:29.592
You know, no frills.

13:29.592 --> 13:31.594
Well, if it'll help out,
we'll close the bar early,

13:31.594 --> 13:32.461
and you can have it here.

13:32.461 --> 13:34.847
Why, thank you, Samuel.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.849
That's very nice of you.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.350
Hey! Hey, wait a second.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.602
Who knows,

13:39.602 --> 13:41.387
when Fitz sees what a nice guy I am,

13:41.387 --> 13:42.888
maybe he'll, uh,
remember me in his will.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.273
CARLA: Yeah.

13:44.273 --> 13:46.108
"To the idiot son of my new wife,

13:46.108 --> 13:48.110
I leave squat."

13:51.614 --> 13:54.867
(lively jazz playing)

13:54.867 --> 13:56.702
(music continues)

13:56.702 --> 13:59.205
Uh, Mr. Clavin, some of
your guests have been asking

13:59.205 --> 14:01.207
if they can take the
plastic wrap off the food.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.708
Huh.

14:02.708 --> 14:03.709
Don't they understand?

14:03.709 --> 14:05.211
When food is exposed to air,

14:05.211 --> 14:06.712
just about anything can happen.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.215
Yeah, people could eat it.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.218
Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny, wise guy.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.219
Oink, oink, Mr. Peterson.

14:13.719 --> 14:14.720
Let's have a little restraint.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.223
This food's got to last
us the rest of the night.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.477
Oh, the girls are here!

14:21.477 --> 14:23.262
(men whooping and shouting)

14:23.262 --> 14:25.014
CLIFF: Oh, Sammy, Sammy,

14:25.014 --> 14:27.349
I thought this was gonna
be a low-budget affair.

14:27.349 --> 14:28.350
My treat.

14:28.350 --> 14:31.153
Oh, hey, well, in that
case, ladies, welcome!

14:31.153 --> 14:33.072
Shake it, bake it, let's
see if we can take it!

14:33.072 --> 14:35.074
(laughs)

14:35.074 --> 14:37.576
Oh, come on in here
and let me introduce you

14:37.576 --> 14:39.828
to the, uh, the guest of honor tonight.

14:39.828 --> 14:41.113
There he is.

14:41.113 --> 14:42.615
Sic him!

14:42.615 --> 14:44.617
(belly dancing music plays)

14:50.122 --> 14:52.625
(laughing): Hey!

14:52.625 --> 14:54.009
Eh, so, Fitz,

14:54.009 --> 14:56.045
how are you enjoying your
bachelor party so far?

14:56.045 --> 14:57.846
I haven't been this excited

14:57.846 --> 15:01.850
since I first trapped
vapor in my input valve.

15:01.850 --> 15:04.853
No man forgets his first time, huh?

15:04.853 --> 15:06.355
(chuckling): Oh, my!

15:06.355 --> 15:08.724
Hey, don't worry, Fitz,
they're not gonna bite.

15:08.724 --> 15:10.976
Yeah, he's right. That costs extra.

15:12.861 --> 15:14.613
Hey! SAM: Hey, girls.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.482
What're you doing back
here? I thought you had

15:16.482 --> 15:18.317
a bachelorette party
going. Yeah, yeah, but, uh,

15:18.317 --> 15:20.319
I have to borrow some money
against next week's loan.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.321
Can you give me 50 bucks?

15:22.321 --> 15:24.823
All right. What do you, uh...

15:24.823 --> 15:26.325
what do you need it for?

15:26.325 --> 15:29.328
We're going to a dance recital.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.714
You need 50 bucks for a dance recital?

15:31.714 --> 15:35.634
We have to have something to
stick in the guys' underwear.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.554
(both laughing)

15:38.554 --> 15:40.055
Good for you.

15:40.055 --> 15:42.308
Esther here is okay.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.642
I mean, you can't blame her

15:43.642 --> 15:47.396
for one horrible crime against humanity.

15:47.396 --> 15:49.598
Where, uh... where's Diane?

15:49.598 --> 15:51.016
We ditched her.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.020
There you are!

15:57.856 --> 15:59.825
How on earth did we get separated?

15:59.825 --> 16:01.827
I have no idea.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.829
I thought we all got in the taxi,

16:03.829 --> 16:05.831
but when it pulled away from the curb,

16:05.831 --> 16:07.833
I was the only one inside.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.335
(laughs)

16:11.837 --> 16:13.839
Uh, this is... this is fun, but, I...

16:13.839 --> 16:15.341
you girls are gonna have to leave.

16:15.341 --> 16:16.842
This is "men only" here.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.345
Oh... Oh... Okay, okay.

16:19.845 --> 16:22.848
You know, instead of going
to that club you suggested,

16:22.848 --> 16:24.350
we could try Cafe au Lait.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.852
They have a wonderful
new harpist, I hear.

16:26.852 --> 16:27.853
Oh, great.

16:27.853 --> 16:30.356
No, that sounds like fun.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.358
I'll hail a cab.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.859
Let's go!

16:35.861 --> 16:37.863
Hey, Normie, Normie,

16:37.863 --> 16:40.115
things are going very smoothly.

16:40.115 --> 16:41.950
Yeah, yeah, I think Fitz might donate

16:41.950 --> 16:43.952
some money to, uh, my favorite charity.

16:43.952 --> 16:48.323
Yeah? What's that? Save
the Clavin Foundation.

16:48.323 --> 16:50.743
I am having the time of my life!

16:50.743 --> 16:52.745
I knew you would, Fitz.

16:52.745 --> 16:53.746
You know,

16:53.746 --> 16:56.749
I didn't warm up to
you at first, but, uh,

16:56.749 --> 16:59.635
I'm beginning to think
you're not so bad after all.

16:59.635 --> 17:01.470
Yeah? When did you
come to that conclusion?

17:01.470 --> 17:02.971
Figure it out for yourself.

17:02.971 --> 17:05.840
(music continues)

17:11.262 --> 17:13.265
Then she says to her
girlfriend, "Maybe so,

17:13.766 --> 17:15.267
but this one's eating my popcorn."

17:15.267 --> 17:16.268
(laughter)

17:16.268 --> 17:18.270
Okay, okay, I guess it's time

17:18.270 --> 17:20.772
for me to take off
the psychiatrist's cap

17:20.772 --> 17:22.273
and tell one of my own.

17:22.273 --> 17:24.276
All right! All right, well,

17:24.276 --> 17:27.780
it seems there's these two men
stranded on a deserted island.

17:27.780 --> 17:28.781
Doug and Dave.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.282
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

17:30.282 --> 17:32.167
This is better with dialects. Uh...

17:32.167 --> 17:34.620
Okay, so an Irishman and a Dane

17:34.620 --> 17:36.622
are stranded on a--
no, wait a second.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.541
I-I don't do Danish. Um...

17:39.541 --> 17:41.460
Okay! An Irishman and a Swede.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.461
All right. That's it.

17:42.461 --> 17:43.962
Patrick and Lars.

17:43.962 --> 17:46.965
So Lars turns to Patrick
one day, and he goes, uh...

17:46.965 --> 17:49.468
(Swedish accent): "How
much water have you left?"

17:49.468 --> 17:50.969
(laughter)

17:50.969 --> 17:51.970
Oh, no, gee, wait a second.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.972
I-I think one of them's
supposed to be a rabbi.

17:56.108 --> 17:59.111
(conga music playing)

17:59.111 --> 18:00.112
Whoa!

18:05.567 --> 18:07.035
The King of the Conga.

18:07.536 --> 18:09.538
Hey, Cliffy, how am I
doing? Ah, you're a vision,

18:09.538 --> 18:11.907
Fitz, a vision!

18:11.907 --> 18:15.794
Woody, I don't think I've
done that since my wedding.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.246
Oh, you conga'd at your wedding?

18:17.246 --> 18:20.249
No, I sweated.

18:20.249 --> 18:23.252
Okay, now, I want to get
the punch line just right

18:23.252 --> 18:25.754
because otherwise, I'll
ruin the whole joke.

18:25.754 --> 18:28.140
Uh, you know, it's
all the noise in here.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.892
Would you mind? It's
kind of distracting.

18:29.892 --> 18:31.894
I'll, uh, I'll be back in a second.

18:31.894 --> 18:33.395
Kick up your heels, Fitz.

18:33.395 --> 18:34.396
That's it, faster!

18:34.396 --> 18:36.398
Hey, Fitz! Fitz, hey, maybe
you ought to sit one out.

18:36.398 --> 18:37.900
You've been going pretty hard there.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.902
No, no, Sammy, it's
his last night to howl.

18:39.902 --> 18:40.903
Let him live it up, huh?

18:40.903 --> 18:42.404
Hey, listen, thank you, Cliffy.

18:42.404 --> 18:44.907
You've given me one of the
very great nights of my life.

18:44.907 --> 18:47.409
And I want to promise you

18:47.409 --> 18:49.912
I'm gonna take very good care of you.

18:54.116 --> 18:55.617
Sammy...

18:55.617 --> 18:57.619
is there a tear in my eye?

18:57.619 --> 18:59.121
No, no.

18:59.121 --> 19:01.623
Are there dollar signs in my eyes?

19:02.624 --> 19:04.126
Yeah, I think

19:04.126 --> 19:06.011
there are, Cliffy. (laughs): Oh-ho...

19:06.011 --> 19:07.796
Hey, Normie, did you hear that?

19:07.796 --> 19:09.798
I'm gonna be rollin' in it!

19:09.798 --> 19:14.269
Yeah, you been rollin'
in it for years, Cliff.

19:14.269 --> 19:17.272
Come quick! This is
terrible! Fitz is really sick!

19:17.272 --> 19:18.690
Oh, my God!

19:20.692 --> 19:22.694
Okay, I've got it!

19:22.694 --> 19:24.196
(Irish accent): "Glory be.

19:24.196 --> 19:26.198
Nobody knows the rubble I've seen."

19:26.198 --> 19:27.649
(Frasier laughing)

19:27.649 --> 19:30.652
No, no, that wasn't it.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.375
All right, before we
go home, one more time.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.243
Fitz. Hell of a guy.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.745
To Fitz. Fitz. Fitz.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.750
It was a lovely service.

19:44.750 --> 19:49.254
And, Diane, your choice
of poem was wonderful.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.756
Thank you.

19:50.756 --> 19:54.643
I just wish I hadn't been
cut off right in the middle.

19:54.643 --> 19:58.597
We had to-- the eternal
flame was starting to go out.

19:58.597 --> 20:00.599
Good night, Sammy.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.100
Yeah. Good night, all.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.102
WOODY: You know, funerals
are a lot different here

20:04.102 --> 20:05.604
than they are back home.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.105
NORM: Yeah? How's that, Woody?

20:07.105 --> 20:10.108
Well, where I come
from, when somebody dies,

20:10.108 --> 20:12.110
people come from miles around,

20:12.110 --> 20:15.614
bake lots of pies,
bring all kinds of food,

20:15.614 --> 20:18.617
make speeches, ride the roller coaster.

20:19.585 --> 20:20.586
Oh, wait,

20:20.586 --> 20:22.454
that might be the state fair.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.762
Ma...

20:31.263 --> 20:32.264
you okay?

20:32.264 --> 20:34.132
ESTHER: I'm fine.

20:34.132 --> 20:35.467
I just was gonna straighten up

20:35.467 --> 20:37.970
in here a little.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.471
You don't have to do that, Ma.

20:39.471 --> 20:40.973
No, I want to.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.976
Oh, will you look at
the rings on this table.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.979
Don't people use coasters anymore?

20:46.979 --> 20:50.983
Ma... whenever you're trying
to hide something inside,

20:50.983 --> 20:54.987
you always pick up some
household chore to do.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.990
Now, I don't know if
you realize it, but...

20:57.990 --> 21:00.993
since Fitz passed away,
you... you haven't cried,

21:01.493 --> 21:02.995
you... you haven't got upset,

21:02.995 --> 21:04.997
you haven't shown any kind of emotion.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.999
Well, what's there to be upset about?

21:06.999 --> 21:08.000
I barely knew the man.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.003
We just had some good
times together, that's all.

21:11.003 --> 21:14.506
Ma... stop wiping.

21:16.508 --> 21:18.510
(sobbing)

21:20.012 --> 21:22.014
That's it, Ma.

21:22.014 --> 21:25.017
You just let it all out now.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.020
(sobbing)

21:28.020 --> 21:31.023
Good, good. Now, don't you feel better?

21:31.523 --> 21:35.827
(loud sobbing)

21:35.827 --> 21:39.748
Yeah, that should just about do it, huh?

21:39.748 --> 21:43.251
(sobbing)

21:43.251 --> 21:46.171
Good. One last little spurt.

21:46.171 --> 21:49.591
(sobbing)

21:49.591 --> 21:51.760
Ma, you know, there's
a fine line between

21:51.760 --> 21:55.097
expressing your feelings and blubbering.

21:55.097 --> 21:58.050
(crying, chuckling)

21:58.050 --> 21:59.551
(chuckles)

21:59.551 --> 22:02.554
I'm sorry. I guess you're right.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.056
I'll get you a glass of water, Ma.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.558
Oh, well.

22:06.558 --> 22:09.478
Life goes on.

22:09.478 --> 22:11.980
I guess I have to accept the fact

22:11.980 --> 22:15.283
that I'm not the type
that good things happen to.

22:15.283 --> 22:18.403
Well, I don't know, Ma.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.405
I mean, there was, uh,

22:20.405 --> 22:21.907
one good thing that happened to you

22:21.907 --> 22:25.410
about, uh, well, 37 years ago.

22:26.828 --> 22:29.331
There certainly
was-- not many women

22:29.331 --> 22:33.335
get to shake hands with Bing Crosby.

22:33.335 --> 22:38.256
(clears throat): Well,
there you are, huh?

22:40.258 --> 22:43.762
Oh, Cliff, you know I mean you.

22:43.762 --> 22:47.265
You're my pride and joy.

22:47.265 --> 22:50.769
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.773
Gee, think of that.
