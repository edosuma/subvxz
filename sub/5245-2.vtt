WEBVTT

02:44.749 --> 02:46.751
Let's get down!

03:57.113 --> 03:59.032
This is going to sell better
than the original.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.037
The time has come
to take Pablo's money.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.881
- Search.
- What's happening?

04:15.882 --> 04:18.426
Look at that.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.554
Your prize dog didn't even stop.

04:21.638 --> 04:23.848
There's no coke in that boat.

04:23.932 --> 04:24.974
Come here.

04:26.684 --> 04:30.980
It's blended
right into the fiberglass hull.

04:32.065 --> 04:35.610
Give me the money... the cash!

04:35.693 --> 04:38.279
Looks like you got taken
with this dog, brother.

04:39.530 --> 04:43.117
- Hold this a moment.
- Oh, Marquessa, my dear...

04:44.077 --> 04:45.286
It's OK, it's OK.

04:49.916 --> 04:53.044
- Are you fucking crazy?
- What?

04:53.127 --> 04:54.545
It's my dog.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.595
Son of a bitch.

05:02.804 --> 05:04.138
What happened?

05:04.222 --> 05:06.182
You want to know what happened?
Go look.

05:08.101 --> 05:09.310
Pablo?

05:09.394 --> 05:14.065
- Pablo, we have a motherfucking problem.
- Bastard murderer.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.693
- He killed the dog.
- I don't give a shit.

05:16.776 --> 05:19.696
If we don't resolve this problem,
we're gonna all get murdered.

05:21.781 --> 05:25.076
- Come on, man.
- Son of a bitch.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.747
Let's see...

05:31.791 --> 05:33.251
This is the problem?

05:34.252 --> 05:36.421
People are watching us, Pablo.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.464
They're asking themselves
how two small businessmen

05:38.548 --> 05:41.050
suddenly came up with so much cash.

05:41.134 --> 05:42.510
Gustavo, brother...

05:43.970 --> 05:45.596
just launder the money.

05:46.639 --> 05:50.643
Make it look legitimate, that's all.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.523
Isn't that what Al Capone did?

05:57.442 --> 06:00.069
- Al Capone?
- Al Capone.

06:01.446 --> 06:03.197
You're a dumb-ass, Pablo.

06:03.281 --> 06:05.700
- Al Capone is a terrible example.
- Why?

06:05.783 --> 06:08.411
Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.

06:09.579 --> 06:11.080
This is too much to launder.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.416
Well then...

06:14.917 --> 06:17.336
let's buy a bigger washing machine.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.879
You're spending too much cash, Pablo.

07:00.922 --> 07:04.342
You have Picassos, Dalis, farms,

07:04.425 --> 07:08.221
houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars.

07:09.305 --> 07:12.058
I told you we have to fly low.

07:12.892 --> 07:16.270
If you keep spending like that,
you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine.

07:16.354 --> 07:18.689
And if that happens,
the government is going to have our asses.

07:18.773 --> 07:20.900
Enough, Gustavo, enough.

07:21.109 --> 07:23.111
What do you want me to say?

07:23.986 --> 07:25.613
Bury it.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.574
- How's that?
- Bury the cash.

07:28.658 --> 07:30.743
And cut the bullshit.

07:33.121 --> 07:34.914
Go on, pussy.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.186
Hey, Mom.

07:57.270 --> 08:00.314
- I'm praying, Pablo.
- Just for a second.

08:04.152 --> 08:05.278
Sit.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.412
It isn't very comfortable, Pablito.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.330
I'll buy you another sofa later.

08:16.414 --> 08:19.584
Wouldn't it be better
if you put all this money in a bank, son?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.377
No.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.921
All bankers are bandits.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.506
Really, honey?

08:54.452 --> 08:56.204
<i>Forbes Magazine says...</i>

08:57.496 --> 08:59.874
...that the narcos have more money

08:59.957 --> 09:03.044
than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.

09:03.127 --> 09:04.128
Let me see?

09:06.631 --> 09:09.759
If we kidnap someone in their family,
what are they going to do?

09:09.842 --> 09:11.219
Call the police?

09:11.969 --> 09:12.803
Commander.

09:13.012 --> 09:18.434
It says here that Gacha, "The Mexican,"
is the ninth richest man in the world.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.394
I say we kidnap his son.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.190
He's a psycho maniac, comrade.

09:25.149 --> 09:28.361
Plus, he's bought off half the military.

09:28.569 --> 09:32.114
Well, the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

09:32.198 --> 09:34.533
Their sister Marta goes to the university.

09:34.617 --> 09:35.826
How about her?

09:38.663 --> 09:42.375
I like that more. The Ochoas are soft.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.919
Wait a second!

09:46.045 --> 09:48.047
What about Pablo Escobar?

11:08.502 --> 11:10.171
What about Pablo Escobar?

11:10.379 --> 11:12.089
He's the richest of them all.

11:13.132 --> 11:15.217
Escobar gives money to the poor.

11:15.301 --> 11:16.469
You're right.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.596
Escobar is a man of the people.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.014
He's all right with me.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.724
OK, then.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.393
Let's do the Ochoas.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.683
Good afternoon.

12:08.354 --> 12:10.189
Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.

12:42.471 --> 12:48.436
Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form
and no I-435 identifying papers, either.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.940
Yes, sir.
They brought an American cat with them.

12:54.775 --> 13:00.281
Sure, but without the I-435, I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

13:02.199 --> 13:06.287
I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.834
Sir, I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.

13:13.836 --> 13:14.753
OK, sir.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.656
- Hello, Pablo.
- Hello, Valeria.

14:23.739 --> 14:26.992
- This is my wife, Tata.
- Hello.

14:27.076 --> 14:29.286
Don't worry. Everything will be perfect.

14:29.370 --> 14:32.206
I'm just not used
to these type of things.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.707
Just be yourself.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.919
Ma'am, it would be best
if you weren't here.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.174
Look, Tata,
there are a lot of people here.

14:42.258 --> 14:44.093
It might not be good for the baby.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.221
Go to the house.

15:17.585 --> 15:18.919
Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.

15:19.003 --> 15:23.424
<i>I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the
man known as "the Robin Hood of the poor"</i>

15:23.507 --> 15:26.051
<i>for his generosity
with the poor of Medellin.</i>

15:41.650 --> 15:45.195
Tell us about your program,
"Medellin Without Slums," Mr. Escobar.

15:45.279 --> 15:48.282
I was born in Rionegro,
not too far from here.

15:48.365 --> 15:53.078
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

15:53.162 --> 15:55.956
can be so out of touch
with what they need.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.709
Hospitals, social and athletic programs,

15:58.792 --> 16:01.920
plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.966
I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

16:06.050 --> 16:07.968
Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr. Escobar?

16:08.052 --> 16:12.431
None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.433
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.

16:14.516 --> 16:20.731
For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

16:20.814 --> 16:23.567
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

16:23.776 --> 16:27.946
<i>They don't know the dreams
of common people, but I do...</i>

16:39.166 --> 16:41.585
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

17:17.663 --> 17:19.331
Thank you.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.422
Does your wife do it standing up?

18:54.927 --> 18:58.764
Don't ever disrespect Tata.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.849
Do you hear me?

19:04.728 --> 19:08.315
I'm sorry, Pablo. I'm sorry.

19:10.776 --> 19:12.194
Forgive me.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.826
It won't happen again.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.077
I promise.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.131
How can I apologize?

19:48.856 --> 19:50.858
Want to put it in my ass?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.622
We get better every time we practice.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.707
You're amazing, Javi.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.799
Don't go overboard.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.557
It's the truth.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.936
What can you offer me to drink?

21:09.019 --> 21:11.271
Whiskey or tap water.

21:12.397 --> 21:13.982
Water.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.371
What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.331
It's fine the way it is.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.585
I wasn't offering.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.261
Here.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.519
If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.

21:54.064 --> 21:56.984
- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- Don't take it the wrong way.

21:57.067 --> 22:01.113
It's cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

22:04.032 --> 22:05.367
Take it.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.788
And my visa?

22:10.914 --> 22:13.959
Give me something I can use
and we'll talk about it.

22:20.007 --> 22:22.009
What are you doing this weekend?

22:22.217 --> 22:25.178
- I'm going to Medellin.
- Work or play?

22:26.054 --> 22:27.973
I have to take care of my child.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.559
I can pay, too.

22:34.146 --> 22:36.606
Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam, Javi.

22:40.277 --> 22:41.403
Come here.

22:44.114 --> 22:46.199
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

22:47.034 --> 22:48.744
Give me a kiss.

22:59.588 --> 23:02.257
I guess I'll have to find another girl.

23:02.466 --> 23:06.094
Good luck with that.
We're all going to Medellin.

23:06.303 --> 23:08.263
Some of us are even going by plane.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.143
Helena?

23:13.226 --> 23:14.644
Helena?

23:18.565 --> 23:20.025
Whose party is it?

24:19.000 --> 24:23.505
Just one thing.
Who told you about this?

24:25.757 --> 24:27.592
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

24:37.602 --> 24:43.275
<i>Pablo says they're not going to pay a dime
to M-19 for Marta Ochoa. Gustavo, too.</i>

24:43.358 --> 24:48.155
<i>- And Jorge?
- No. Jorge doesn't agree.</i>

24:48.238 --> 24:51.658
- <i>Then what?</i>
- <i>They're all going to</i> a <i>meeting.</i>

24:51.741 --> 24:53.743
<i>At Las Margaritas.</i>

24:53.827 --> 24:56.538
<i>- Everyone?
- Yeah, they'll all be there.</i>

27:09.129 --> 27:11.589
- Good day, Major.
- Good day.

27:11.673 --> 27:16.594
Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.225
Fresh meat.

28:55.485 --> 29:02.492
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,
is that we form an organization.

29:02.575 --> 29:09.582
Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

29:10.417 --> 29:15.713
And so the message is clear,
we're going to name our group...

29:15.797 --> 29:18.133
"Death to Kidnappers."

29:20.218 --> 29:21.886
What I propose...

29:22.762 --> 29:25.723
I will manage all operational aspects.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.393
All you need to do is cover my expenses.

29:29.769 --> 29:32.730
What you gentlemen
will receive in return:

29:32.814 --> 29:34.441
two things.

29:34.524 --> 29:37.569
One... I promise to end the kidnapping.

29:38.486 --> 29:42.115
Two... and at this moment,
the most important...

29:43.241 --> 29:47.412
I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.

29:50.165 --> 29:53.668
Death to Kidnappers!

30:09.058 --> 30:11.019
Come in! Enjoy!

30:12.729 --> 30:16.024
Don't forget La Quica!
Take care of him, too.

30:20.612 --> 30:21.988
Sit down, my love.

30:24.824 --> 30:27.494
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

30:27.577 --> 30:29.537
I like your hat.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.456
It looks good on you.

30:32.290 --> 30:33.958
- Do you think so?
- Yes, it looks good.

30:34.042 --> 30:35.293
Let's see.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.379
Very cute.

31:27.136 --> 31:28.888
You're tired.

31:31.057 --> 31:33.226
Let me relax you a bit.

31:39.023 --> 31:42.026
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

31:47.198 --> 31:49.409
What did you hear?

31:49.492 --> 31:51.786
Nothing. Just making conversation.

32:14.559 --> 32:16.311
I want you to find the girl.

32:17.854 --> 32:20.064
I can pick up a sicario.
You OK with that?

32:20.148 --> 32:22.358
- I'm going with you.
- What about Fresh Meat?

32:27.614 --> 32:29.073
That's it, guys.

32:44.464 --> 32:45.548
Guys.

32:45.632 --> 32:47.342
Hey, what happened?

32:47.425 --> 32:49.677
That little girl doesn't move.
Like a dead cow.

32:49.761 --> 32:51.137
What, did you kill her?

33:00.146 --> 33:02.106
It's my turn now.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.626
Where's the girl?

33:22.669 --> 33:25.505
- Where's the girl, asshole?
- I don't know.

33:26.714 --> 33:28.257
I don't know.

33:29.425 --> 33:30.510
Choke him.

33:41.229 --> 33:44.148
Enough with the party.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.027
I gotta rough this girl up.

33:48.111 --> 33:50.238
Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.824
(Sasha's paranoid.

33:54.200 --> 33:58.538
Wait a second...
I don't like them bruised.

33:58.621 --> 34:00.998
Let me have a little more fun,
then I'll let her go.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.875
It's all right, boys.

34:03.626 --> 34:05.044
This one's for all of you!

34:05.253 --> 34:07.338
Slap her around!

34:24.647 --> 34:26.023
- Should I tell him?
- No.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.234
Remember what Carrillo said.

34:28.317 --> 34:30.278
Sorry, I don't speak English.

34:41.330 --> 34:44.667
- How far is it?
- Come on, you piece of shit.

35:39.847 --> 35:41.224
Helena?

35:45.061 --> 35:47.146
I'm going to get you out of here, OK?

35:48.231 --> 35:50.274
I promise.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.877
All right. She's coming out.

36:14.549 --> 36:16.175
Copy, Major.

36:16.259 --> 36:17.343
Let's go, boys.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.864
- Where's Pefia?
- Over there.

38:15.753 --> 38:21.133
"Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound...
or your family is next."

38:22.259 --> 38:24.178
Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."

38:30.768 --> 38:32.561
Please! Please, let me go.

38:32.770 --> 38:35.147
- Hurry up!
- Please, don't!

38:53.749 --> 38:58.004
- Tell him to get a little closer.
- A little closer.

38:58.087 --> 38:59.964
A little closer!

39:00.047 --> 39:02.800
You know what, boss?
Go a little higher.

39:02.883 --> 39:06.971
A little bit higher and a little bit
closer so you can see the tree!

39:08.222 --> 39:09.557
That's it.

39:11.642 --> 39:15.730
Now a little bit higher...
so you can see the little tree!

39:18.524 --> 39:21.068
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS

39:21.152 --> 39:22.820
A little more.

39:22.903 --> 39:25.906
That's it! There you go.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.244
- Much better.
- Yes, boss.

39:37.168 --> 39:40.921
Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?

39:41.005 --> 39:43.174
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you crazy or what?

39:43.257 --> 39:45.217
Stupid asshole.

39:45.301 --> 39:47.053
It's a woman with a baby.

39:48.054 --> 39:51.849
Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.100
Do it.

39:53.184 --> 39:55.144
Good day, ma'am.

39:55.352 --> 39:59.440
- Good day.
- I'm sorry, but the park is closed today.

39:59.523 --> 40:01.484
What do you mean the park is closed?

40:01.567 --> 40:03.652
May I escort you out?

40:03.736 --> 40:06.197
Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.

40:06.280 --> 40:11.452
It's because there is a foul odor
and I don't want the child to get sick.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.746
I thought I smelled something.

40:13.829 --> 40:15.247
- Right?
- Yes.

40:15.331 --> 40:17.041
Oh, look,
what a beautiful little baby.

40:17.124 --> 40:19.585
Right, just like his dad.
Thank you very much.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.713
- You must be proud.
- Yes, of course.

40:22.797 --> 40:25.883
My wife and I are having a baby very soon.

40:25.966 --> 40:28.260
Oh, very good. Congratulations!

40:28.344 --> 40:31.222
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,
but as long as it's healthy.

40:31.305 --> 40:35.851
Yes, of course.
The most important thing is health.

40:57.456 --> 40:58.958
Hey, Don Pablo.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.628
What do you want us to do
with this guy?

41:05.214 --> 41:06.799
Should I kill him or what?

41:15.558 --> 41:17.893
From what I can see,
you're not going to stop.

41:19.228 --> 41:21.856
Here I am,
so you can finish what you started...

41:23.566 --> 41:25.943
but with the sword of Bolívar.

41:52.261 --> 41:55.973
It's a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.

42:00.769 --> 42:01.854
Stand up.

42:05.733 --> 42:11.697
I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.

42:16.327 --> 42:19.830
From now on,
we are going to work together.

42:27.713 --> 42:29.006
Go in peace, brother.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.357
Is that What I think it is?

42:47.399 --> 42:49.026
You've gotta be kidding.

42:54.823 --> 42:58.244
I want you to run
my day-to-day operations.

43:00.496 --> 43:02.831
And you'll do what?

43:05.042 --> 43:07.211
Liberate Colombia.
