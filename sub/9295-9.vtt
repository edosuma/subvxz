00:30.184 --> 00:32.151
<i>I think she
went to meet</i>

00:32.183 --> 00:33.151
some guy.

00:33.184 --> 00:34.418
Take a look at this.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.650
You think you can find her?

00:37.118 --> 00:39.218
You promise me
I do this one thing for you,

00:39.251 --> 00:41.151
and then you'll leave me alone.

00:41.184 --> 00:43.118
<i>That's not gonna happen.</i>

00:43.151 --> 00:45.385
This is a sweet operation
that we got going here.

00:45.418 --> 00:46.984
You know? You getting
the access codes,

00:47.018 --> 00:48.151
and us pulling the jobs.

00:48.184 --> 00:49.817
You can't do this to me, Kevin.

00:54.751 --> 00:56.650
You know who I am?

00:56.684 --> 00:58.684
<i>All I know is
that there's</i>

00:58.717 --> 01:00.550
a very powerful man
in the Russian Syndicate

01:00.584 --> 01:02.018
who's been trafficking
weapons-grade uranium.

01:02.051 --> 01:02.951
Who do you work for?

01:02.984 --> 01:04.550
I'm not at liberty to say.

01:04.584 --> 01:05.684
Dmitri, work on him,

01:05.717 --> 01:07.650
until he's ready
to tell us everything.

01:08.884 --> 01:12.218
(yelling in pain,
electrical zapping)

01:12.251 --> 01:14.917
(gunshots)

01:19.684 --> 01:22.184
It's over, you
know that, right?

01:22.218 --> 01:24.784
You want to know
where the rods are?

01:24.817 --> 01:26.051
I will tell you.

01:26.084 --> 01:27.851
But I want full immunity.

01:33.084 --> 01:34.584
Command, are you seeing this?

01:34.617 --> 01:36.218
Where the hell are the rods?

01:36.251 --> 01:38.418
We've picked up
trace radiation signatures.

01:38.451 --> 01:39.351
The rods were here.

01:39.385 --> 01:41.717
I told you, they were there.

01:41.751 --> 01:43.485
I had two of my men
guarding them.

01:43.517 --> 01:44.917
We found their bodies;
both shot.

01:44.951 --> 01:46.351
(quietly):
Josef.

01:46.385 --> 01:48.151
I wasn't sure I believed, Josef,

01:48.184 --> 01:49.517
that you would betray
your father.

01:49.550 --> 01:51.751
You were upset that he was
holding up delivery of the rods.

01:51.784 --> 01:52.884
Now I've gotten them for you.

01:52.917 --> 01:54.151
When will you get here?

01:54.184 --> 01:55.251
Less than five minutes.

01:55.284 --> 01:57.418
Just have my money ready.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.984
*

02:47.284 --> 02:49.051
(speed-dialing phone)

02:52.018 --> 02:53.817
CTU. O'Brian.
Chloe, it's Jack.

02:53.851 --> 02:55.451
Do you have Hastings there?
Yes.

02:55.485 --> 02:57.550
Are you ready to
trace the call?
We're ready.

02:57.584 --> 02:59.550
As soon as Bazhaev gets
his son on the phone,

02:59.584 --> 03:02.717
we can begin
to triangulate.
Okay, hold on.

03:07.717 --> 03:09.717
(phone ringing)

03:10.917 --> 03:12.884
Farhad, where are you?
You're late.

03:12.917 --> 03:14.884
Josef, it's me, your father.

03:14.917 --> 03:16.485
Don't hang up.
Stay on the line.

03:16.517 --> 03:17.717
Please.

03:17.751 --> 03:19.517
I know you
have the rods.

03:19.550 --> 03:20.717
Yes.

03:20.751 --> 03:22.418
I wanted you to know.

03:22.451 --> 03:24.351
The police know, too.
They're here.

03:24.385 --> 03:26.184
You told the police?

03:26.218 --> 03:27.550
Of course not.

03:27.584 --> 03:29.485
It was Vladimir's buyer--
he's a Federal agent.

03:29.517 --> 03:30.650
JACK:
Josef, just so we're

03:30.684 --> 03:32.118
up front, I'm here
with your father.

03:32.151 --> 03:34.051
My name is Jack Bauer;
I work with CTU.

03:34.084 --> 03:37.251
Well, do what you want
with him; I don't care.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.517
Maybe you don't--
but your father cares

03:39.550 --> 03:41.251
about you.

03:41.284 --> 03:43.684
He negotiated immunity for you.

03:43.717 --> 03:46.151
All you need to do
is bring the fuel rods in,

03:46.184 --> 03:48.151
and you can put
the rest of this behind you.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.584
It's the only way
you'll be safe.

03:49.617 --> 03:52.517
Safe? Did my father tell you
about my other brother?

03:52.550 --> 03:53.851
What he did to him?

03:53.884 --> 03:55.385
Oleg was dying;
you know that.

03:55.418 --> 03:56.984
Yeah, we could have saved him.

03:57.018 --> 03:59.184
He would be alive if not
for your precious deal.

03:59.218 --> 04:01.351
You are right, maybe you
are right, I don't know,

04:01.385 --> 04:03.617
but... that doesn't
bring Oleg back,

04:03.650 --> 04:06.184
and I cannot bear
to lose another son.

04:06.218 --> 04:07.784
Don't worry about me.

04:07.817 --> 04:09.650
I'll be fine.
No, you won't be.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.184
You won't be anything.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.517
It's over.

04:12.550 --> 04:13.984
Federal agents are here

04:14.018 --> 04:15.018
going through
everything.

04:15.051 --> 04:17.550
The entire city
is under guard.

04:17.584 --> 04:20.451
If you don't bring
the rods in, they
will hunt you down.

04:20.485 --> 04:21.617
They will kill you, Josef.

04:21.649 --> 04:24.550
I won't be able
to protect you.

04:25.584 --> 04:27.751
I don't want to see you hurt.

04:31.084 --> 04:32.984
If I hand over the rods,

04:33.018 --> 04:35.051
how does this work?

04:35.084 --> 04:37.817
Tell us where you are,
and we'll bring you in.

04:37.851 --> 04:39.318
Oh, just like that?

04:39.351 --> 04:40.684
After everything
we've done?

04:40.717 --> 04:43.318
Yes, I told you-- they
have given us immunity.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.784
Please, Josef, please.

04:47.018 --> 04:49.917
This is your last chance.

04:51.251 --> 04:52.951
Are you there?

04:52.984 --> 04:54.650
Yes, I'm here.

04:54.684 --> 04:56.084
You need to bring him in now,

04:56.118 --> 04:58.051
before Farhad
gets there.

04:58.084 --> 04:59.617
Josef, did you hear that?

04:59.650 --> 05:01.084
You need to move.

05:01.118 --> 05:02.851
Josef?

05:05.351 --> 05:06.917
All right, I'm on my way.

05:06.951 --> 05:10.251
I'll call you from the road to
let you know where to meet me.

05:10.284 --> 05:11.485
Careful with the rods.

05:13.717 --> 05:15.451
(shot booms)

05:15.485 --> 05:16.517
Sounded like
shots fired.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.817
You need to help him!

05:17.851 --> 05:18.717
Where is he?!

05:18.751 --> 05:19.884
I don't know.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.517
Chloe, did you get a
trace on that call?

05:21.550 --> 05:23.218
Not exactly, but it
looks like he was

05:23.251 --> 05:25.817
in central Queens
near Flushing Meadow Park.

05:25.851 --> 05:27.218
I want units
combing that area.

05:27.251 --> 05:29.284
- Jack, bring your
suspect back to CTU.
- Copy that.

05:29.318 --> 05:32.584
<i>Get him ready
for transport now.</i>

05:36.018 --> 05:37.650
Is he dead?
Yes.

05:37.684 --> 05:39.485
We need to hurry.

05:39.517 --> 05:41.485
(over phone):
The boat is waiting for us
at the port.

05:41.517 --> 05:42.485
The port may not
be the right thing.

05:42.517 --> 05:44.385
What do you mean?

05:44.418 --> 05:45.684
The authorities know our plan.

05:45.717 --> 05:47.884
We need a new one.

05:47.917 --> 05:49.318
Hey.

05:54.851 --> 05:56.784
Did you get that?

05:56.817 --> 05:59.617
Yes, Jack. We're
trying to get an I.D.
off the voice print.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.650
So far, no luck locking
down a location.

06:01.684 --> 06:04.684
Copy that.
We're on our way back now.

06:14.251 --> 06:16.584
We need to hurry.
Take the van and get the rods...

06:16.617 --> 06:18.218
We've got a match for the voice

06:18.251 --> 06:20.084
at the end of the call--
Farhad Hassan.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.884
So, he got
his fuel rods.

06:21.917 --> 06:24.517
Any I.D. on the
other man we heard?
No, sir.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.884
Mr. Hastings,
Rob Weiss for you.

06:27.917 --> 06:29.084
Tell him I'll be

06:29.118 --> 06:31.184
right with him.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.984
Give me an ETA on Bazhaev.

06:35.018 --> 06:36.984
Yes, sir.
Start the interrogation

06:37.018 --> 06:38.817
as soon as he gets here.

06:42.751 --> 06:45.118
(phone rings)
Yeah?

06:45.151 --> 06:47.218
Jack, it's Chloe.
Hastings wants your ETA.

06:47.251 --> 06:48.617
He's anxious to
interrogate Bazhaev.

06:48.650 --> 06:50.018
I'm about
15 minutes out.

06:50.051 --> 06:51.784
But I wouldn't count on
getting anything from him.

06:51.817 --> 06:54.151
If Bazhaev could have told me
how to get to the people

06:54.184 --> 06:55.717
that just killed his
son, he would have.

06:55.751 --> 06:58.717
Jack, I heard about
what you went through.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.650
Are you okay?

07:01.684 --> 07:04.418
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

07:04.451 --> 07:06.018
How's Renee?

07:06.051 --> 07:08.284
Pretty worried about you.

07:08.318 --> 07:10.151
They've still got her
in medical.

07:10.184 --> 07:13.218
Yeah. Could you
patch me through to her?

07:13.251 --> 07:14.318
Hold on.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.084
Okay.

07:16.118 --> 07:19.550
(phone rings)

07:19.584 --> 07:20.584
Hey.

07:20.617 --> 07:21.917
Renee, I have Jack.

07:24.051 --> 07:25.284
Jack.

07:25.318 --> 07:26.717
How are you?

07:26.751 --> 07:28.717
Uh, fine, I'm fine.
What about you?

07:28.751 --> 07:30.284
We had a line
on the fuel rods.

07:30.318 --> 07:32.084
We lost it.

07:33.550 --> 07:34.884
So what's the plan now?

07:34.917 --> 07:36.385
It's Hastings' call.

07:36.418 --> 07:38.650
I'm bringing the prisoner
back to CTU, then I'm out.

07:38.684 --> 07:41.051
They ask you about what
happened, about Vladimir?

07:41.084 --> 07:42.650
Uh, yes, Chloe did.

07:42.684 --> 07:43.917
Chloe did the debrief?

07:43.951 --> 07:45.385
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't...

07:45.418 --> 07:47.184
I wouldn't really
call it a debrief.

07:47.218 --> 07:50.650
We talked, uh,
mostly, and, uh,

07:50.684 --> 07:53.318
- then I wrote a statement.
- And you explained how you
acted in self-defense?

07:53.351 --> 07:54.418
Yes, like we agreed.

07:54.451 --> 07:55.617
That's how it happened.

07:55.650 --> 07:56.951
Renee, you've got
to stick with that.

07:56.984 --> 07:59.650
Yeah, yes, I'm gonna try.

07:59.684 --> 08:01.817
I know this is hard for you,

08:01.851 --> 08:03.851
but you did nothing wrong,

08:03.884 --> 08:07.684
and you need to start
believing that.

08:07.717 --> 08:09.051
Okay?

08:09.084 --> 08:11.318
(exhales):
Okay.

08:11.351 --> 08:14.351
Jack, I don't...
I don't know how to say this,

08:14.385 --> 08:16.351
so I'm just gonna say it,
'cause I need to make sure

08:16.385 --> 08:18.184
that I'm not
misunderstanding, but..

08:18.218 --> 08:20.451
when you say
that I "have you"...

08:20.485 --> 08:22.218
I meant it like it sounded.

08:23.617 --> 08:25.584
So now what do we do?

08:25.617 --> 08:28.151
We'll figure it out.

08:28.184 --> 08:30.318
Okay.

08:30.351 --> 08:32.616
I'll be in in about 15 minutes.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.150
Bye.

08:49.717 --> 08:52.351
- Rob, it's Brian.
- I just got a flash from
your office how this

08:52.385 --> 08:54.284
immunity situation the
president authorized played out.

08:54.318 --> 08:55.851
It's not good, Brian.

08:55.884 --> 08:57.118
Really not.

08:57.151 --> 08:58.851
Now, as I understand it,
Bazhaev's son swiped

08:58.884 --> 09:00.784
the rods from his father
before we got there.

09:00.817 --> 09:01.851
That's correct.

09:01.884 --> 09:03.684
- And now the son is dead.
- Yes.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.517
Do we know who
has the rods now?

09:05.550 --> 09:08.018
Apparently, it's
Farhad Hassan.

09:08.051 --> 09:09.351
And where is he?

09:09.385 --> 09:11.984
We're looking.
Meaning you have no idea.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.650
Brian, I pushed the president
to resurrect CTU

09:13.684 --> 09:14.917
with you at the helm.

09:14.951 --> 09:17.517
Now, you tell me you can do
the job, I believe you.

09:17.550 --> 09:18.517
I can do the job.

09:18.550 --> 09:19.784
Good to hear it.

09:19.817 --> 09:21.851
'Cause when things get
this colossally screwed up,

09:21.884 --> 09:24.784
people look for
someone to blame.

09:24.817 --> 09:26.617
So what are you saying?

09:26.650 --> 09:29.084
I'm saying I don't want
that person to be you.

09:29.118 --> 09:31.717
I put you there;
you're my guy.

09:31.751 --> 09:33.650
If you fail, I fail.

09:33.684 --> 09:35.917
And that cannot happen.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.351
Are we on the
same page here?

09:38.385 --> 09:41.051
So what have you got in mind?

09:41.084 --> 09:43.385
Renee Walker.

09:43.418 --> 09:45.851
She killed one of our main
leads, isn't that correct?

09:45.884 --> 09:47.817
He was a psychopath--
she was defending herself.

09:47.851 --> 09:49.650
She stabbed him 15 times.

09:49.684 --> 09:51.684
What, are you saying
it was murder?

09:51.717 --> 09:53.717
I'm saying that's
for lawyers to decide.

09:53.751 --> 09:56.817
We're talking about a woman
who put her life on the line

09:56.851 --> 09:58.151
when she didn't have to.

09:58.184 --> 09:59.917
I'm sure that will
weigh in her favor.

09:59.951 --> 10:01.485
You know what
a conviction would mean--

10:01.517 --> 10:02.617
she'd go away for years.

10:02.650 --> 10:04.550
Well, someone has to
pay for this, Brian.

10:04.584 --> 10:06.717
so you tell me-- who
do you want that to be?

10:08.751 --> 10:10.717
I'm sending someone over
from Justice.

10:10.751 --> 10:12.617
A Kristin Smith.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.650
She'll take care of everything.

10:16.184 --> 10:17.984
What do you need from me?

10:18.018 --> 10:20.517
Just open the door
and get out of the way.

10:33.434 --> 10:34.567
We did a sweep, sir.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.434
No trace of any
hazardous materials.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.834
- Fine. Finish up,
get back to base.
- Yes, sir.

10:38.867 --> 10:41.200
(phone rings)

10:42.701 --> 10:44.100
Arlo?

10:44.133 --> 10:45.400
Yeah.

10:45.434 --> 10:47.001
- Find Dana yet?
- I think so.

10:47.034 --> 10:49.133
I'm tracking the GPS
coordinates off her phone.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.968
All right, send
them to my PDA.

10:51.001 --> 10:53.701
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I mean, there could be

10:53.734 --> 10:56.267
- a reasonable explanation...
- Hey, you're the one who
stuck his nose in all this.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.467
Just do it.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.701
Okay.

10:59.734 --> 11:01.300
Coordinates are
on your phone.

11:01.334 --> 11:02.434
Thanks.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.001
Look, I'm sending
everyone back to CTU.

11:04.034 --> 11:05.467
What are you
going to do?

11:05.500 --> 11:06.701
I'll be there within the hour.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.968
If Hastings asks,

11:08.001 --> 11:09.834
just tell him
I'm following up a lead.

11:09.867 --> 11:11.734
Look, I know Dana means
a lot to you,

11:11.767 --> 11:14.167
but do you really think this is
worth going AWOL over?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.133
She's my fiancee, Arlo.

11:22.601 --> 11:25.100
Jim, I'm taking your vehicle.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.667
Find Owen, have him
take SWAT back to CTU.

11:27.701 --> 11:29.100
Say I'll be
right behind them.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.567
No problem, sir.

12:01.434 --> 12:04.434
(faint music from van radio)

12:23.001 --> 12:25.400
(rock music plays loudly,
indistinct conversation)

12:25.434 --> 12:27.434
(chuckles)

12:43.467 --> 12:45.133
Is Dana back yet?

12:45.167 --> 12:46.434
I don't think so, sir.

12:46.467 --> 12:47.901
Do you need her
for something?

12:47.934 --> 12:50.601
Do I need her for something?

12:50.634 --> 12:53.467
Yes, Arlo,
she's my chief data analyst.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.701
I need her to do her job.

12:55.734 --> 12:59.200
You track her down, and you
let me know when you find her.

12:59.233 --> 13:01.667
Mr. Hastings, Kristin Smith
from the Justice Department

13:01.701 --> 13:03.534
- is here to see you.
- Thank you.

13:12.233 --> 13:14.200
Ms. Smith.

13:14.233 --> 13:15.968
Mr. Hastings.

13:16.001 --> 13:17.068
Did Rob Weiss brief you?
He did.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.100
I have to interview
a Renee Walker.

13:18.133 --> 13:20.334
I read her statement
on the way over.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.167
Did it appear to you that
she's guilty of murder?

13:22.200 --> 13:25.434
Mr. Weiss warned me you might
have issues with this.

13:25.467 --> 13:27.334
With hanging a brave woman
out to dry?

13:27.367 --> 13:28.767
Yes, I do.

13:28.801 --> 13:30.867
There are major discrepancies
between her statement

13:30.901 --> 13:32.068
and the forensic evidence.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.334
All I'm asking her to do

13:33.367 --> 13:36.300
is to set
the record straight.

13:37.968 --> 13:40.968
I feel it would be prudent
to restrict surveillance access

13:41.001 --> 13:43.434
to this interview.
Fine.

13:43.467 --> 13:45.534
But I would also like
a video record of it

13:45.567 --> 13:46.801
in the event
of legal proceedings.

13:46.834 --> 13:48.334
Can I ask you to provide that?

13:48.367 --> 13:50.968
Yes. Right this way, please.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.634
This is a transcript
of your statement.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.267
You should review it

14:05.300 --> 14:08.233
before you sign it.

14:08.267 --> 14:10.001
How far out did Jack
say he was?

14:10.034 --> 14:11.834
15 minutes.

14:14.068 --> 14:15.434
This is Kristin Smith
from Justice.

14:15.467 --> 14:16.901
She needs to
talk to Renee,

14:16.934 --> 14:18.400
so if you'll
excuse us, Chloe.

14:18.434 --> 14:19.667
Talk to her about what?

14:19.701 --> 14:20.767
Now, Chloe.

14:28.334 --> 14:29.767
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.767
What is she talking
to her about?

14:38.801 --> 14:40.133
She was about to sign
her statement.

14:40.167 --> 14:41.367
I already
debriefed her.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.667
Kristin just needs
to fill in a few details.

14:42.701 --> 14:43.801
I already filled in
the details.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.834
I know that you are
protective of Renee.

14:45.867 --> 14:48.167
- I respect that.
- Then let me sit in
on the interview.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.734
Why?

14:49.767 --> 14:52.667
Was your debrief not a full
and honest statement of the facts?

14:52.701 --> 14:54.867
We have nuclear materials
in the hands of terrorists.

14:54.901 --> 14:57.233
Now, I need you back
at your desk focused on that.

14:59.701 --> 15:00.901
Yes, sir.

15:12.734 --> 15:14.801
What is this place?

15:14.834 --> 15:17.034
A staging area.

15:17.068 --> 15:19.133
It belongs to a businessman
who supports our cause.

15:19.167 --> 15:20.701
I don't want
to delay too long.

15:20.734 --> 15:22.500
We need to find
another way

15:22.534 --> 15:24.801
to get the nuclear rods
out of the country.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.500
You heard what the American said
to Bazhaev's son.

15:27.534 --> 15:29.200
They already know
what we're trying to do.

15:29.233 --> 15:31.100
Which is why we need
to move quickly.

15:31.133 --> 15:33.567
The Americans are not
stupid, Farhad.

15:33.601 --> 15:35.734
If we go near
any airfield

15:35.767 --> 15:40.167
or harbor now, the radiological
detectors will spot us.

16:09.901 --> 16:11.934
Who are these men, Samir?

16:11.968 --> 16:15.334
These are men I have recruited.
Our men.

16:15.367 --> 16:16.567
What are they doing here?

16:16.601 --> 16:17.767
They're going to unload
the rods.

16:17.801 --> 16:19.500
We need to get rid
of the van.

16:19.534 --> 16:20.500
And then what?

16:20.534 --> 16:23.001
You should rest.

16:23.034 --> 16:24.434
I don't need to rest.

16:24.467 --> 16:26.334
I need to know
what we're doing.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.267
We can't get the rods
out of the country.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.300
So let's use them.

16:36.334 --> 16:39.068
Use them? How?

16:39.100 --> 16:40.434
As a weapon.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.567
A radiological bomb.

16:42.601 --> 16:47.100
We'll show the Americans
how strong we are.

16:47.133 --> 16:48.834
Show them how strong we are?

16:48.867 --> 16:51.034
Are you out
of your mind?

16:51.068 --> 16:52.534
If we use the rods

16:52.567 --> 16:56.567
against the Americans,
they will destroy our country.

16:56.601 --> 16:59.934
They'll bomb us, invade.

16:59.968 --> 17:02.267
And if we do nothing,
they'll invade us anyway.

17:02.300 --> 17:06.233
That's what this peace treaty
with your brother is all about.

17:06.267 --> 17:09.601
They're trying to turn us
into another corrupt,

17:09.634 --> 17:11.701
Mid-East regime with
your brother as dictator,

17:11.733 --> 17:13.534
kept in power by
American guns

17:13.567 --> 17:15.267
and money.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.968
Isn't that what we came together

17:17.001 --> 17:18.701
to prevent?

17:28.767 --> 17:30.534
Is there no other way?

17:30.567 --> 17:35.100
America will always
be our enemy.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.434
Remember, my friend--

17:41.367 --> 17:44.567
even a giant can be toppled
by a single stone.

17:48.267 --> 17:52.034
We need to make them fear us.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.300
Then I'm with you.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.734
SMITH:
So you said in your statement

18:42.768 --> 18:46.434
that you killed Vladimir
Laitanan in self-defense.

18:46.467 --> 18:48.000
Is that correct?

18:48.033 --> 18:49.900
Yes, that's why it's
in my statement.

18:49.933 --> 18:52.167
What I didn't see
in the statement

18:52.200 --> 18:54.701
was any mention of your history
with Laitanan.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.768
You did have a history with him.

18:56.801 --> 19:00.134
I worked an undercover operation
with the FBI six years ago.

19:00.167 --> 19:01.401
Vladimir Laitanan
was the target.

19:01.434 --> 19:03.467
And during the course
of that operation,

19:03.501 --> 19:05.667
you had to get close to him.

19:05.701 --> 19:06.933
He became obsessed with you.

19:06.967 --> 19:09.933
He tried
to rape you.

19:09.967 --> 19:11.033
Yes.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.200
But you were able to stop him.

19:13.234 --> 19:15.067
I fought him.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.701
Put me in the hospital
with two broken ribs.

19:17.734 --> 19:19.300
I'm sure that's in there, too.

19:19.334 --> 19:21.933
You were able to fight off
a stronger, violent man.

19:21.967 --> 19:25.868
It's impressive.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.734
But this time
when he attacked you,

19:27.768 --> 19:29.067
you didn't fight him off.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.000
I couldn't.

19:32.033 --> 19:34.933
He had his hands around my neck
trying to strangle me.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.501
I understand.

19:38.534 --> 19:40.567
You thought he was going
to kill you.

19:40.601 --> 19:42.200
You were in fear for your life.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.134
So what happened next?

19:52.834 --> 19:55.868
He was choking me.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.933
I grabbed the knife
and I stabbed him.

19:57.967 --> 19:59.900
In self-defense?

19:59.933 --> 20:02.567
Yes.

20:02.601 --> 20:07.768
You stabbed him
in self-defense... 15 times.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.467
15 times.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.000
The first blow alone

20:13.033 --> 20:16.501
could have stopped him,
but you didn't stop.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.967
Look at me, Renee.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.801
You were an investigator
for the FBI.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.167
By all accounts,

20:28.200 --> 20:30.501
one of the best they had.

20:30.534 --> 20:32.701
Put yourself on my
side of the table.

20:32.734 --> 20:34.768
Look at what
I'm looking at.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.267
There's a dead body.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.267
On the one hand,
I have your statement

20:40.300 --> 20:42.501
saying you acted
in self-defense.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.501
On the other, I have these.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.667
Evidence of a sustained

20:45.701 --> 20:50.467
and furious assault
with clear intent to kill.

20:50.501 --> 20:51.701
Now as an investigator,

20:51.734 --> 20:53.900
you know which version
is true, don't you?

20:56.067 --> 20:58.167
I acted in self-defense.

21:02.401 --> 21:05.367
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

21:05.401 --> 21:09.834
You used an operation of
unparalleled importance

21:09.868 --> 21:12.267
to seek revenge against a
target without any regard

21:12.300 --> 21:13.534
for the final
outcome.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.300
I'm telling you,
he attacked me first.

21:15.334 --> 21:17.567
Ms. Walker, I'm well aware
of your sacrifice

21:17.601 --> 21:21.167
in service to this country,
but I do not think

21:21.200 --> 21:25.367
that it is fair or right
that CTU should be taken down

21:25.401 --> 21:27.267
because you used this
operation to seek out

21:27.300 --> 21:28.501
your own personal
vendetta

21:28.534 --> 21:30.868
against Vladimir Laitanan.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.868
I looked at your file.

21:33.900 --> 21:38.334
This isn't the first time
you lost control.

21:38.367 --> 21:42.434
You almost killed Alan Wilson.

21:42.467 --> 21:46.768
That's why you got fired
by the FBI, isn't it?

21:46.801 --> 21:50.367
Yes.

21:52.967 --> 21:56.167
I can see what this is
doing to you, Renee.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.200
It is tearing you
up inside.

22:00.801 --> 22:03.734
Let it out.
Tell me the truth.

22:03.768 --> 22:06.634
You killed Vladimir Laitanan
because the thought

22:06.667 --> 22:11.734
of him touching you again
was intolerable.

22:11.768 --> 22:13.768
Do the right thing here.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.900
That's what happened,
isn't it, Renee?

22:26.768 --> 22:30.567
Is that right, Renee?

22:34.601 --> 22:36.601
(tires screeching)

22:43.634 --> 22:45.000
Put him into holding.

22:45.033 --> 22:46.100
No phone calls.
No communication.

22:46.134 --> 22:47.401
I would like
to see my son's body.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.667
We haven't found him yet.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.434
- What's wrong?
- I've been trying to reach you.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.734
It's about Renee. She's
being questioned again.

22:53.768 --> 22:55.334
I thought you said you already
completed the debrief.

22:55.367 --> 22:56.634
I did. Hastings ordered it.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.200
He called in some woman
from the Justice Department.

22:59.234 --> 23:00.868
Where's Renee now?

23:00.900 --> 23:02.768
She's in medical.

23:02.801 --> 23:05.434
Can you get eyes
in that room?

23:05.467 --> 23:06.933
No. He cut off
all access.

23:06.967 --> 23:08.267
What is going on?

23:08.300 --> 23:09.900
They're setting her up
to take the fall

23:09.933 --> 23:11.067
for the failure
of this mission.

23:27.768 --> 23:29.401
Sorry, sir.
No one's...

23:37.234 --> 23:38.334
They're setting you up.
Don't say another word.

23:38.367 --> 23:40.167
It's too late.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.801
What do you think you're doing?
Get out of here now.

23:44.033 --> 23:44.933
How dare you?

23:44.967 --> 23:48.134
After everything
she sacrificed.

23:48.167 --> 23:50.267
After everything
she's lost.

23:50.300 --> 23:51.434
Have you no decency?

23:51.467 --> 23:54.067
Jack.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.167
(groans)

23:55.200 --> 23:56.900
This is over.

23:59.467 --> 24:00.768
Hands in the air.

24:00.801 --> 24:03.000
Do it now!

24:03.033 --> 24:04.634
Son, you better
put that down

24:04.667 --> 24:06.501
or you're going
to get hurt.

24:08.868 --> 24:09.834
It's all right.

24:09.868 --> 24:12.768
Go.

24:12.801 --> 24:14.701
(electricity crackling,
screaming)

24:14.734 --> 24:17.667
Ma'am, hands
in the air.

24:17.701 --> 24:19.701
(groans)

24:34.467 --> 24:35.868
Do you have what you need

24:35.900 --> 24:39.234
to turn
the rods into a bomb?

24:39.267 --> 24:41.000
We're gathering
materials.

24:41.033 --> 24:42.200
Must be difficult

24:42.234 --> 24:44.501
at such
short notice.

24:44.534 --> 24:49.367
Explosives, no.
Detonator?

24:49.401 --> 24:52.033
We're working on it.

24:52.067 --> 24:54.768
I might know somebody.

24:54.801 --> 24:56.868
A professor in the city.

24:56.900 --> 24:59.234
With expertise
in electronics.

24:59.267 --> 25:00.534
You sure
he can be trusted?

25:00.567 --> 25:01.701
Yes.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.134
He will help.

25:03.167 --> 25:05.033
He will do
whatever I ask.

25:05.067 --> 25:07.367
But still...

25:07.401 --> 25:10.334
I will bring this
up very carefully.

25:10.367 --> 25:12.834
I need to talk
to him in private.

25:15.167 --> 25:16.634
Very well.

25:16.667 --> 25:18.300
There's a phone
in the office.

25:18.334 --> 25:21.200
Ali will take you.

25:26.634 --> 25:29.000
(engine starting)

25:46.300 --> 25:49.467
What is the target?
Is that decided?

25:52.267 --> 25:55.234
So many targets in New York.

25:55.267 --> 25:57.234
It will be hard
to choose.

26:00.467 --> 26:02.167
(screams)

26:02.200 --> 26:03.967
(groans)

26:10.701 --> 26:12.834
Samir!
Over here!

26:14.567 --> 26:18.367
(shouting in native language)

26:28.967 --> 26:30.734
It was Farhad.
He escaped.

26:30.768 --> 26:33.834
Find him!

26:33.868 --> 26:35.634
Now!

26:35.667 --> 26:38.234
(man shouting
in native language)

26:55.027 --> 26:56.628
Cuffs off.

27:00.060 --> 27:02.194
Give us the room.

27:03.994 --> 27:05.561
Sit down, Jack.

27:05.594 --> 27:07.561
I'll stand.

27:07.594 --> 27:10.194
So, this is the new CTU--
you hang your own.

27:10.227 --> 27:12.494
If you mean Renee Walker, we're
just asking some questions.

27:12.527 --> 27:13.728
Standard procedure.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.760
Standard procedure is a debrief,
which Chloe completed.

27:15.827 --> 27:19.227
But instead, you've got
some hack from Justice in there

27:19.261 --> 27:20.494
trying to initiate
a criminal prosecution.

27:20.527 --> 27:21.728
We're just trying to
establish the facts.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.294
You're trying
to save your ass.

27:24.994 --> 27:27.194
I was there when you
asked her for her help.

27:27.227 --> 27:30.094
And she gave it to you,
and we acquired the target.

27:30.127 --> 27:33.494
And this is how
you pay her back.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.427
I'm not going
to let you do this.

27:35.461 --> 27:37.461
I'll call
the White House first.

27:37.494 --> 27:39.227
The White House knows.

27:39.261 --> 27:40.960
Rob Weiss
sent that woman over here.

27:40.994 --> 27:42.194
Sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear.

27:42.227 --> 27:43.494
I meant I'd call the president.

27:43.527 --> 27:45.494
Well, good luck with that,
Jack, because I think

27:45.527 --> 27:47.927
the president takes
murder pretty seriously.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.661
My recollection? She
prosecuted her own daughter.

27:52.361 --> 27:56.494
Now, I'm not asking.
Sit down.

28:07.194 --> 28:08.927
Sorry to interrupt.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.294
We're busy, Chloe.
I don't mean to intrude,

28:11.327 --> 28:13.927
- but I've got Farhad Hassan
on the line.
- Farhad Hassan?

28:13.960 --> 28:15.860
I didn't believe it, either,
but the voice prints match.

28:15.893 --> 28:17.461
Can you tell where he is?

28:17.494 --> 28:18.561
No. He's on a secure line.

28:18.594 --> 28:19.760
Can I just put him through?

28:24.860 --> 28:26.060
Mr. Hassan.

28:26.094 --> 28:28.561
This is Brian Hastings,
director of CTU.

28:28.594 --> 28:30.793
There are people chasing me.

28:30.827 --> 28:32.194
They have the rods
you're looking for.

28:32.227 --> 28:33.628
I thought you
had the rods.

28:33.661 --> 28:35.394
No. No more.

28:35.427 --> 28:36.694
They turned against me.

28:36.728 --> 28:37.927
They have their own plan--

28:37.960 --> 28:39.194
an attack on New York.

28:39.227 --> 28:40.960
An attack on New York?

28:40.994 --> 28:42.060
When, exactly?

28:42.094 --> 28:43.394
Soon.

28:43.427 --> 28:44.294
Very soon.

28:44.327 --> 28:45.461
Who are these people?

28:45.494 --> 28:47.494
They are IRK operatives
working in this country.

28:47.527 --> 28:48.960
Okay, I need names.

28:48.994 --> 28:51.294
Just get me out of here.

28:51.327 --> 28:53.494
I'll tell you everything I know.

28:53.527 --> 28:54.994
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan.

28:55.027 --> 28:57.027
I give you my word.
Now, where are you?

28:57.060 --> 28:59.527
Forest Hills.

28:59.561 --> 29:02.860
Uh, some kind
of boat warehouse.

29:02.893 --> 29:05.294
Hurry. I'm injured.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.427
They're hunting me.

29:06.461 --> 29:08.160
Hold on and keep
this line open.

29:08.194 --> 29:10.060
What do you
want me to do?

29:10.094 --> 29:11.760
Pinpoint his location
and get me Cole.

29:11.793 --> 29:12.927
I can't.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.027
What do you mean,
you can't?

29:14.060 --> 29:15.160
His team came back.
He didn't.

29:15.194 --> 29:17.361
Owen said he was
following a lead.

29:17.394 --> 29:18.694
All right, fine.
Get me Owen.

29:18.728 --> 29:19.827
Tell him he's going
to be leading the team.

29:19.860 --> 29:20.827
Owen? Are you sure?

29:20.860 --> 29:22.527
Just do it, Chloe.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.527
(sighs)

29:29.394 --> 29:31.793
They're going to take
you down and process you.

29:31.827 --> 29:34.060
I want you out of this building.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.628
Fine.

29:54.728 --> 29:56.793
(rustling and banging)

29:58.494 --> 29:59.461
(van door opens)

30:02.027 --> 30:03.994
(rock music playing)

30:04.027 --> 30:06.261
Hey, hey, come on.

30:06.294 --> 30:07.494
What's the hurry?
What's the hurry?

30:07.527 --> 30:08.793
What's the hurry?
Your friend's

30:08.827 --> 30:10.361
a total freak show.

30:10.394 --> 30:12.027
I know, but come on.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.994
Don't go.
I'll make it up to you.

30:14.027 --> 30:15.628
Okay? Come on.

30:15.661 --> 30:17.060
At least let me give you
a ride back into town.

30:17.094 --> 30:18.261
We'll walk.

30:19.661 --> 30:22.160
Night, ladies!

30:22.194 --> 30:25.494
(laughing)

30:25.527 --> 30:27.994
(both sigh)

30:28.027 --> 30:29.294
Gonna take a leak.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.294
All right.

30:32.361 --> 30:34.227
(banging)

30:34.261 --> 30:35.461
(guy laughing)

30:52.860 --> 30:54.860
*

31:10.860 --> 31:12.394
Cole, what are you doing here?

31:12.427 --> 31:13.860
You're asking me that?
We're in the middle

31:13.893 --> 31:15.827
of an operation, Dana. You
can't just abandon your post.

31:15.860 --> 31:17.461
I can explain.

31:17.494 --> 31:18.927
You can explain later.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.793
Right now, I'm taking you
back to CTU.

31:20.827 --> 31:22.527
We can deal with
our personal problems

31:22.561 --> 31:23.960
after we've secured
the nuclear materials.

31:23.994 --> 31:24.960
It's not what you think.

31:24.994 --> 31:26.561
Yeah? What do I think?

31:26.594 --> 31:28.060
I am not sleeping with him.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.793
Save it.
I saw the pictures.

31:29.827 --> 31:31.127
What pictures?

31:31.160 --> 31:32.160
Just get in.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.494
I am not leaving!
Why the hell not?

31:34.527 --> 31:36.227
Because if I leave,
this will never end.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.060
What will never end?

31:38.094 --> 31:40.227
You do not understand.

31:40.261 --> 31:42.094
Then make me understand,
damn it!

31:42.127 --> 31:43.494
I don't think that I can.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.594
Try.

31:49.927 --> 31:51.628
Okay.

32:14.694 --> 32:17.494
(door slams)

32:17.527 --> 32:18.893
We don't have a lot of time.

32:18.927 --> 32:21.227
So you better start talking.

32:21.261 --> 32:23.827
(sighs)

32:23.860 --> 32:28.327
My name is not Dana Walsh.

32:28.361 --> 32:30.361
It's Jenny Scott.

32:52.827 --> 32:53.961
Yes?

32:53.994 --> 32:54.961
You find Farhad?

32:54.994 --> 32:55.994
Still looking.

32:56.027 --> 32:58.027
I injured him badly.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.227
He won't get far.

32:59.261 --> 33:01.127
We don't know who he
might have contacted.

33:01.161 --> 33:03.493
I'll be traveling with the
rods to a secure location.

33:03.527 --> 33:04.794
Do you want me to come in?

33:04.827 --> 33:05.794
No.

33:05.827 --> 33:08.794
You stay here,
and you find him.

33:09.927 --> 33:11.627
(clattering)

33:11.660 --> 33:12.994
(shouts)

33:27.261 --> 33:30.094
It's a six-acre warehouse
complex in Forest Hills.

33:30.127 --> 33:32.927
Farhad is somewhere
in one of these buildings.

33:32.961 --> 33:34.428
The rods must be there, too.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.660
Drones are airborne,

33:35.694 --> 33:37.194
but they won't have eyes
for another 12 minutes.

33:37.227 --> 33:38.261
What about the police?

33:38.294 --> 33:39.428
They're redirecting
their resources,

33:39.460 --> 33:41.394
but it's a big area--
it's gonna take

33:41.428 --> 33:43.361
a while to cordon off.
MAN:
Director Hastings.

33:43.394 --> 33:44.394
You wanted to see me, sir?

33:44.428 --> 33:46.760
In the absence of Agent Ortiz,

33:46.794 --> 33:49.394
I assume you're ready
to take charge of the operation.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.694
- Yes, sir. Three units standing by.
- All right. I'll walk you out.

33:51.727 --> 33:55.061
- There's a lot of pressure
on you, Agent Owen.
- Oh, I can handle it, sir.

33:55.094 --> 33:57.361
All right, talk me through it.
What's the attack grid?

33:57.394 --> 33:58.994
Our working theory's
that the nuclear materials

33:59.027 --> 34:00.627
are still in the proximity
of Farhad.

34:00.660 --> 34:02.027
Teams Alpha and Bravo are tasked

34:02.061 --> 34:03.527
with locating
and securing the rods.

34:03.560 --> 34:04.827
What about Team Charlie?

34:04.860 --> 34:06.927
They're responsible
for the actual evac, sir.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.659
It's a standard urban
search-and-rescue--

34:08.694 --> 34:09.994
we're in, we're out.

34:10.027 --> 34:12.360
Nothing standard
about it.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.827
Wait here.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.261
Jack.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.194
Jack.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.592
You've got something
to say, say it.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.726
Think about it. The people
that are chasing Farhad

34:26.760 --> 34:28.560
already know they've got
a big security problem,

34:28.592 --> 34:31.061
so most likely by the
time your men get there,

34:31.094 --> 34:32.726
those fuel rods
will be long gone.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.527
And you're down to one
team covering Farhad?

34:34.560 --> 34:36.094
What if they run
into resistance?

34:36.127 --> 34:37.460
What if they do?

34:37.493 --> 34:38.793
Well, at that point, you
start shooting at people

34:38.827 --> 34:40.027
that have a higher
intel value

34:40.061 --> 34:41.360
than the man you're
going to try and save.

34:41.393 --> 34:43.460
Agent Owen knows
the priority is to take

34:43.493 --> 34:44.493
all hostiles alive.

34:44.527 --> 34:45.793
Under fire?

34:45.827 --> 34:47.226
No assignment's more difficult.

34:47.261 --> 34:49.293
Agent Owen has
my full confidence.

34:50.328 --> 34:52.061
Yeah. If that were true,

34:52.094 --> 34:54.127
you wouldn't be standing
here talking to me.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.927
You offering
to bring in Farhad?

34:57.961 --> 35:00.927
Yes. If you drop the
criminal investigation

35:00.961 --> 35:02.961
against Renee Walker.

35:02.994 --> 35:06.428
Look, I know you don't
want to prosecute her.

35:06.460 --> 35:08.328
I can be your out.

35:08.361 --> 35:12.061
I hear what you're saying,
but I can't help you, Jack.

35:13.460 --> 35:16.294
I've sat in that
chair before.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.127
The chair you're
sitting in now.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.627
I know what it's like.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.361
There's a lot of
demands on you,

35:23.394 --> 35:25.261
many of them
unreasonable.

35:25.294 --> 35:29.560
But the people that last here,
the ones that mattered...

35:29.593 --> 35:31.760
they knew when to say no.

35:31.794 --> 35:34.460
It's the White House;
you don't say no.

35:34.493 --> 35:37.227
You are the head of CTU--
you've got

35:37.261 --> 35:39.127
a lot more juice
than you think.

35:39.161 --> 35:41.227
Especially with a
nuclear weapon in play.

35:44.560 --> 35:48.161
If we do this, Jack, it's not
for one rescue operation.

35:48.194 --> 35:52.061
It's till this whole thing
is over and done.

35:52.094 --> 35:55.428
You want Renee freed up,
you're not in and out anymore.

35:55.460 --> 35:58.027
I want you in with both feet.

36:05.161 --> 36:06.727
Deal.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.294
Deal.

36:14.428 --> 36:16.961
I found an NYPD
evidence warehouse in Queens

36:16.994 --> 36:20.694
with $120,000 from a drug bust
just sitting there.

36:20.727 --> 36:24.460
It was only a matter
of getting them in and out

36:24.493 --> 36:25.894
between patrols.

36:25.927 --> 36:27.994
Wait, you actually
committed a robbery?

36:30.493 --> 36:33.061
Put yourself in my place, Cole.

36:33.094 --> 36:35.827
Kevin was going to tell Hastings
I'm a convicted felon.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.694
He was going to ruin my life.

36:37.727 --> 36:38.994
What would you
have done?

36:39.027 --> 36:40.328
Not this.

36:42.428 --> 36:45.493
Kevin promised
that if I went along,

36:45.527 --> 36:47.493
he would never
bother me again.

36:47.527 --> 36:49.127
Let me guess.

36:49.161 --> 36:51.361
He didn't keep his end
of the bargain.

36:55.593 --> 36:58.061
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

36:59.961 --> 37:01.694
What do you mean?

37:01.727 --> 37:03.727
What's in your hand?

37:14.094 --> 37:15.593
You were going to kill them.

37:15.627 --> 37:17.860
I don't know
what I was going to do.

37:17.894 --> 37:19.860
You were going to shoot them
in cold blood.

37:19.894 --> 37:21.827
Cole, listen to me.

37:21.860 --> 37:23.860
I was wrong.

37:23.894 --> 37:27.127
I see that now,
but I was scared.

37:27.161 --> 37:28.894
I thought that I

37:28.927 --> 37:29.927
was doing this
for us.

37:29.961 --> 37:31.560
For us?
Are you out of your mind?

37:35.560 --> 37:38.261
I love you, Cole.

37:39.894 --> 37:41.961
Don't say another word.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.261
Not one more word.

37:46.194 --> 37:48.027
Cole, where are you going? Cole!

37:48.061 --> 37:50.127
Stay in the truck.

37:50.161 --> 37:52.460
Cole, don't do this.

37:53.493 --> 37:54.660
Cole.

37:54.694 --> 37:55.961
Please, I am begging you.

37:55.994 --> 37:57.493
This is my problem, not yours.

37:57.527 --> 37:59.493
Stay back.

38:00.593 --> 38:02.394
What?

38:12.660 --> 38:13.627
(coughing)

38:13.660 --> 38:15.760
Hey, hey!

38:15.794 --> 38:17.328
COLE:
Yeah, go for it.
That way,

38:17.361 --> 38:19.194
I only have to deal
with one of you losers.

38:22.161 --> 38:24.161
I think you got
the wrong address, pal.

38:24.194 --> 38:25.560
Oh, do I?

38:25.593 --> 38:27.161
Somehow, I don't think so.

38:28.227 --> 38:29.527
Hey, maybe you should

38:29.560 --> 38:30.927
just tell us
what it is you want.

38:30.961 --> 38:32.328
Maybe you should shut up
and listen.

38:32.361 --> 38:33.593
DANA:
Cole, please,
come on.

38:33.627 --> 38:34.760
Let's just get
out of here.

38:40.394 --> 38:42.127
I thought you looked familiar.

38:44.860 --> 38:46.493
Looky here, Nick.

38:46.527 --> 38:48.694
It's soldier boy.
Mm-hmm.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.493
No kidding.

38:50.527 --> 38:52.961
You know, it's a shame

38:52.994 --> 38:55.328
that you and I can't
go grab a beer sometime.

38:55.361 --> 38:58.727
You know, just
the two of us.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.560
I'm sure we'd have a lot
to talk about.

39:01.593 --> 39:03.994
I said shut up.

39:04.027 --> 39:07.794
Now, the way I see it,
you guys have two choices.

39:07.827 --> 39:09.961
One, you go back to prison

39:09.994 --> 39:12.794
for grand larceny and
aggravated assault.

39:12.827 --> 39:15.694
I go back to prison,
she goes back to prison.

39:16.727 --> 39:17.994
My guess is,
she's prepared

39:18.027 --> 39:19.227
to live with that.

39:21.161 --> 39:24.560
Choice number two:
I let you walk.

39:24.593 --> 39:26.727
You keep your
100 grand--

39:26.760 --> 39:28.627
or what's
left of it--

39:28.660 --> 39:32.161
and you go back to wherever
it is you came from.

39:33.361 --> 39:34.860
That's it?

39:34.894 --> 39:36.094
That's it.

39:36.127 --> 39:38.094
But if I
ever see you

39:38.127 --> 39:39.827
in this city again...

39:39.860 --> 39:43.061
if I even hear
about you

39:43.094 --> 39:44.460
crossing the
state line,

39:44.493 --> 39:45.927
I'll skip the
formalities

39:45.961 --> 39:48.227
and kill you myself.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.860
Do we have a deal or not?

39:56.194 --> 39:57.593
Yeah.

39:58.627 --> 40:00.694
We got a deal.

40:00.727 --> 40:02.994
Better be sure.

40:03.027 --> 40:04.827
I don't want to see

40:04.860 --> 40:07.094
either one of
you ever again.

40:25.227 --> 40:27.061
Hey, what
are you doing?

40:27.094 --> 40:28.061
Going after him.

40:28.094 --> 40:29.527
Why?

40:29.560 --> 40:31.194
Oh, we get rid of him,

40:31.227 --> 40:32.994
we're right back in business
with her.

40:33.027 --> 40:34.428
Come on, man.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.760
We got what we came for.

40:36.794 --> 40:39.127
We got more.

40:39.161 --> 40:41.794
Now, let's just...
let's not push our luck.

40:41.827 --> 40:43.061
All right?

40:43.094 --> 40:44.361
Come on,
all right?

40:44.394 --> 40:45.627
We're just getting started.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.860
We're done.

40:50.894 --> 40:52.428
Okay?

40:52.460 --> 40:54.627
You got me?

40:56.328 --> 40:58.560
(groaning)

41:03.760 --> 41:05.593
Cole.

41:05.627 --> 41:07.127
What you did back there,

41:07.161 --> 41:08.294
I'll never forget it.

41:08.328 --> 41:10.061
Let's just get back to CTU.

41:10.094 --> 41:12.194
Cole, I'm serious.

41:12.227 --> 41:14.860
Thank you.

41:17.860 --> 41:19.560
Cole.

41:24.428 --> 41:25.560
Jenny!

41:44.894 --> 41:47.660
(gasps, whimpers)

41:50.527 --> 41:52.493
(groaning)

42:02.660 --> 42:05.328
I'm sorry.

42:08.194 --> 42:10.827
I shouldn't
have come back.
