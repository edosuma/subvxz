Davis, your car should be on hospice.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.807
Boy, you're crazy. This car is a classic.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.309
It's barely got 190,000 miles on it.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.979
190,000 miles driving your ass around?

00:21.062 --> 00:22.230
Shit, that's car abuse.

What's so funny when I'm looking
at red tags all over the place?

00:27.485 --> 00:29.821
See, this is why
y'all failed the inspection.

00:29.904 --> 00:33.199
No, we failed the inspection
'cause I couldn't bribe the guy,

00:33.283 --> 00:36.286
not with this big beached whale
flapping and crying all over…

00:36.369 --> 00:40.165
Yeah. We get it. I'm fat and I fell.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.750
This shit is still painful.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.211
Look, you can make fun of how pathetic
he looked on your own time.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.838
I want my place up to code.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.299
This is my place, Bennie's Garage.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.302
If it was your place,
we'd be fixing flying broomsticks.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.429
Okay, all right, keep talking.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.515
This place could be
Lucretia's Nail Emporium in a minute.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.350
You'll be in here picking colors.

01:00.185 --> 01:04.355
Look, the guy told us
what to fix and we'll fix it.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.940
We ain't got no problem here.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.525
And, for Davis, we joke,

01:07.609 --> 01:09.611
-but we got love for you too.

No, man, this has nothing to do with you.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.768
I'm suing your insurance company.

Mama says it's different,

it's like the dumb leading the dumb.

but I'm pretty sure
you're not getting that for your birthday.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.007
But I wanted one forever.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.134
Forever? [scoffs] Child, please.

-Later, Mom.
-Mm-hmm.

05:55.980 --> 05:56.856
Wait a minute.

05:56.939 --> 06:00.818
Here, take this 20 and get your sister
something for her birthday.

on whatever you get her?

ask a question until after lunch.

the Crackleberry Tales?

06:27.303 --> 06:28.846
It's Canterbury Tales.

Is there a tram in this building?

it'd be uncomfortable.

I had to hurry up
'cause they charging by the hour.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.802
I don't know why you bother with lawyers.
You already got one dude shaking you down.

-Just say what you're gonna say, man.
-Bribe the man.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.390

09:17.473 --> 09:20.142
Start by fixing his car.
It don't need that much work.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.896
It might now. I done did some things.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.751
Hey, Auntie, can I borrow $20?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.753
I don't loan money to unemployed children.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.299
It's not for me. You know how Mom
always buys a gift for Maya

09:51.382 --> 09:53.342
and just slaps me and Dad's name on it?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.053
I want to pick out
something nice for her myself this time.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.346
She is my only sister.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.015
That you know of.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.310
Here's a 20.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.146
-Proud of you.
-Thanks, Auntie.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.108
Hey.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.569
What you doing home so early?

10:11.652 --> 10:13.738
Oh, shit, you got fired.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.114
Of course not.

10:15.197 --> 10:19.327
I just stole a bunch of goodies
from the office for Maya's birthday party.

10:19.410 --> 10:23.205
See, everybody be so worried
about the little prescription pads…

10:23.289 --> 10:26.792
[chuckles] But they be slippin'
on the Post-it Notes,

10:26.876 --> 10:28.878
hand wipes and stress balls.

10:31.088 --> 10:34.508
What kid wants
a Mercy General gown and hair cap?

10:34.592 --> 10:36.260
What are they gonna do with paper clips?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.511
Ah!

10:37.595 --> 10:38.929
Necklaces, thank you.

10:39.513 --> 10:42.808
It's an activity and a take-home gift.

10:42.892 --> 10:43.726
Boom.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.563
That is about as ghetto as it gets.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.607
Thank God for me.

10:49.690 --> 10:53.319
-What is all this?
-Party favors that won't get Maya bullied.

10:55.237 --> 10:59.033
Fenty lip gloss, Godiva chocolate?

10:59.825 --> 11:02.995
This is a child's birthday party,
not Oprah's favorite things.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.708
And none of this
goes with my unicorn theme.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.961
Oh, she's over the unicorns.
She's on a princess vibe now.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.213
And you know that how?

11:12.296 --> 11:16.342
Because on the last unicorn party
you threw her, she said,

11:16.425 --> 11:17.593
and I quote,

11:17.677 --> 11:20.388
"I hope this is my last unicorn party."

11:22.682 --> 11:23.766
There it is.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.267
There what is?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.227
You.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.561
[chuckles]

11:27.645 --> 11:31.273
Lucretia's in the building,
running things, taking over.

11:31.857 --> 11:37.279
I mean, well, someone had to save these
kids from your Office Depot extravaganza.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.865
Bringing on the paperclip realness.

11:42.785 --> 11:46.163
And the category is
"Ways you getting on my nerves."

11:46.914 --> 11:48.749
Now back off.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.710
I've got balloons to figure out.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.379
Nothing to figure.
I already went to Balloon Barry's.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.798
He twist them
into animals and celebs. [huffs]

11:55.881 --> 11:57.633
His Drake is uncanny.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.804
-I still need streamers.
-That bag.

12:01.887 --> 12:05.224
-Then I guess I'll get plates and napkins.
-Same bag, under the streamers.

12:05.307 --> 12:10.104
[sighs] Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
As long as I'm getting the cake.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.732
Oops.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.320
Well, strap on your feedbag,
because you the only one eating it.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.366
"Strap on your feed bag"?
The hell is that?

12:23.325 --> 12:25.453
You been around too many white people.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.996
That may be true.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.583
But I'm getting my baby
her favorite cake, Tubby the Whale,

12:30.666 --> 12:34.503
and if you say she don't like
Tubby the Whale, I'mma stab you.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.882
With what? You steal
a letter opener from work too?

12:38.466 --> 12:39.425
Yes.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.428
[instrumental music playing]

12:42.511 --> 12:45.473
Oh, damn.
You guys went in on those repairs.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.808
I'm telling you,
only the best for the best.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.562
We put so many new parts on this car
we damn near gave you a new car.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.606
We even did the inside too.

12:53.689 --> 12:58.068
No more feeling the road on your feet
when you drive, Fred Flintstone.

12:59.403 --> 13:02.323
Oh, damn. Is that a tape player?

13:02.406 --> 13:04.700
You damn right. You know how you get down.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.659
[all laughing]

13:05.743 --> 13:06.786
And that ain't all.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.207
[both] Popcorn!

13:11.791 --> 13:15.503
Garrett's? Oh, man,
that's my shit! [chuckles]

13:15.586 --> 13:18.839
-Oh, man, y'all done did way too much.
-No, man.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.091
-I don't know if I can afford this.
-[sighs]

13:21.634 --> 13:22.843
Here's your bill.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.678
But…

13:25.179 --> 13:27.139
You didn't charge me. It's blank.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.517
'Cause friends don't
take money from friends.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.018
-[Bennie muttering]
-Mm-mmm.

13:31.101 --> 13:35.022
Oh, man. I just wish there was something
I could do for you guys.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.148
-Oh…
-[clears throat]

13:36.232 --> 13:37.983
I mean, I don't need anything.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.487
Bennie?

13:42.780 --> 13:45.032
[sighs] You could drop that suit.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.619
Wait. Are you trying to bribe me?

13:49.328 --> 13:50.496
It depends…

13:51.080 --> 13:52.081
If it's working.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.001
What the hell?
Oh, shit, I should have known.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.671
Mama warned me you might try
and trick me out the suit.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.632
She need to throw herself down
some stairs and get her own lawsuit!

14:01.715 --> 14:06.345
-Hey, man, you better watch your mouth.
-You better watch… Damn!

14:06.428 --> 14:09.807
What the hell wrong with you?
You know I can't fight.

14:11.475 --> 14:14.478
-So, this how you treat a friend.
-Because you're not my friend.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.107
What kind of asshole
doesn't drop a suit after popcorn?

14:19.316 --> 14:22.528
That's that cheddar cheese
with thick caramel. That Chicago mix.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.406
Oh, okay. So, this is the real you.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.366
Nah, let's get real.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.244
Not only am I not dropping the suit,

14:30.953 --> 14:32.705
next time you see me,

14:32.788 --> 14:35.040
I'm going to own this whole damn shop.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.500
Oh, come on. Don't say that, man.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.752
-Get your ass out of here.
-Oh, I'm gone.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.337
-Huh.
-[exhales]

14:42.715 --> 14:44.925
Uh… As soon as someone give me my keys.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.265
[instrumental music playing]

14:51.348 --> 14:53.809
Hey, Hector, uh,
saw we got another shift together.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.269
Okay, stalker.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.981
No. No, it's not like that.
It's a list in the break room

14:59.064 --> 15:01.275
with all the times,
and if you go, you can--

15:01.358 --> 15:03.193
Bernard, chill. I'm joking.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.113
Oh. Okay, cool, 'cause, um…

15:06.697 --> 15:09.491
I brought you one of those apple cinnamon
protein bars that we liked.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.619
These ain't the ones
I left at your place, are they?

15:11.702 --> 15:13.954
Nah. I ate those to get over you.

15:14.538 --> 15:17.207
Oh. Well, I hope they didn't work.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.588
I was thinking, uh, maybe we could
get a drink once we're done.

15:22.671 --> 15:23.964
Yeah? I mean…

15:24.506 --> 15:27.384
I guess if you thirsty, then we could.

15:28.218 --> 15:31.388
I thought we could celebrate.
Coming out is a big deal,

15:31.472 --> 15:34.558
and it'll give you a chance
to drop any other bombs you got.

15:35.643 --> 15:40.856
No, it's the only news in my life.
Nothing else you need to know about.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.192
[instrumental music playing]

15:45.527 --> 15:47.237
Girl, where did you get those nails?

15:47.321 --> 15:50.074
These beautiful, long,
attention-grabbing nails?

15:50.157 --> 15:52.952
Well, they a little scary,
but I'm here for it.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.537
Hey, Jamie.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.247
You're going to class that way?

15:57.331 --> 15:58.958
I'm going that way.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.628
Anybody got an itch,
holla at your girl… Ow!

16:03.379 --> 16:05.381
Careful, girl, I think you cut yourself.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.508
Damn. I'm still getting
the hang of these things.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.970
Be careful, 'cause the school nurse
is way on the other side of the building,

16:11.053 --> 16:12.805
and I don't want my bestie bleeding out.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.808
You smell single. What happened
to your boyfriend body spray?

16:15.891 --> 16:18.268
[scoffs] He fell out
of my backpack on the bus.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.480
I'll bounce back. I just signed up
for the school wrestling team.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.193
Girl, I'm just trying to have
some connection.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.320
[school bell ringing]

16:31.365 --> 16:33.367
No. No.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.577
[sighs wearily]

16:36.245 --> 16:37.913
I'm going to be late to class.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.582
Open, open, open…

16:42.751 --> 16:43.961
Ow!

16:46.338 --> 16:48.674
Wait, Aaliyah Upshaw skipping class?

16:48.757 --> 16:50.843
Oh. Hey, Steph. Actually, I was just--

16:50.926 --> 16:53.178
We're ditching.
Come to the movies with us.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.597
Me? Oh, hell yeah.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.599
Girl, those nails are fire.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.728
Oh. These old things?
I forgot I got them done.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.104
You know, how it… Ow!

17:06.608 --> 17:08.527
[instrumental music playing]

17:10.029 --> 17:11.155
[Lucretia sighs]

17:12.156 --> 17:13.198
Really?

17:14.241 --> 17:15.951
We almost out of birthday juice.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.662
We almost out of food.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.874
These kids eat like their parents
keep them in a damn basement.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.835
Relax. I ordered 200 lemon pepper wings.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.170
I sent Bennie to get them.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.963
-He should be back soon.
-[Bennie] Oh!

17:28.047 --> 17:31.216
You missed me again.
These kids can't shoot for shit.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.762
-Maya ain't got one thug in her class.
-[toy gun fires]

17:34.845 --> 17:37.306
I never seem to plan
for how useless he is.

17:38.015 --> 17:41.518
-Bennie, I told you to go get the wings.
-We on a timeout.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.520
[toy gun fires]

17:43.604 --> 17:45.898
I said we on a timeout, Tyler.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.276
Did y'all see that? That little white boy
done shot me in my back.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.196
Oh, Tyler doesn't have a party hat.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.365
Go get the wings.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.119
Now she telling you what to do.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.831
Yeah, a little bossy Bruno Mars.
I ain't going to get no wings.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.918
Well, no, we really need you to go
and get the wings, baby.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.212
I'm only get the wings 'cause you said.

18:08.295 --> 18:11.757
Hey, this is kind of nice,
us not liking her together.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.762
It's heating up out there.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.098
-How we doing on ice?
-Good.

18:20.641 --> 18:26.105
-You bought an ice cream cake?
-I said I was getting Tubby the Whale.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.273
That's what Tubby is.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.442
[balloons popping]

18:32.111 --> 18:34.780
Can I be off balloon duty?
I keep popping them.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.157
It's 'cause of them stupid nails.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.284
Now, go get
your sister's present, Wolverine.

18:39.868 --> 18:43.038
The nails are the present.
It says "HBD" on the pinky.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.957
Who did you think I'm talking about?

18:45.999 --> 18:52.089
I know you did not use the money
I gave you to get your nails done.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.842
You gave her? She got 20 out of me.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.678
I had to do both hands.

18:57.761 --> 19:01.181
You got to shut this down.
This is how you raise a crackhead.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.436
Wait a minute.
So you didn't get your sister anything?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.814
Of course I did. I'm not a monster.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.067
Maya, come show them
the pretty party shoes I got you.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.195
I love them.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.741
-[Maya falls down]
-[Maya] I'm good!

19:21.660 --> 19:23.162
She'll grow into them.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.956
[instrumental music playing]

19:26.039 --> 19:29.668
I don't think we should put the cake out.
The wings aren't even here yet.

19:29.751 --> 19:33.839
It has to be the right softness.
You don't know Tubby like I do.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.924
I know how the sun works.

19:36.717 --> 19:40.137
Lucretia, I got this. I have a plan.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.557
First, we're gonna do the presents,
then we will have the cake.

19:43.640 --> 19:47.311
Gather 'round everybody.
We're about to do the presents. First!

19:47.394 --> 19:49.188
Go ahead, make your little point.

19:49.271 --> 19:53.567
Just know that one of Tubby's eyes
is slippin'. I'm up here, Tubby.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.697
Ooh, Maya, open mine next.

20:03.952 --> 20:04.953
Oh.

20:05.037 --> 20:05.996
A book.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.584
Maya, this is Born on the Water.
It's all about the history of our people.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.212
-It's a book, Bernard.
-I can't post that.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.506
[chuckles] Well, I can.
I told you to get her the L.O.L. doll.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.259
Baby girl, open Auntie's next.

20:19.343 --> 20:23.639
It doesn't highlight our struggle,
but I think you'll enjoy it.

20:25.140 --> 20:29.019
[gasps] A Switch!
You're the best auntie ever!

20:29.102 --> 20:31.355
[chuckling] Enjoy it.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.399
Uh, excuse me, Best Auntie Ever,

20:34.483 --> 20:37.611
I'd like a word with you over there.

20:37.694 --> 20:38.695
Sure.

20:41.990 --> 20:45.327
Why would you buy her the Switch
when you heard me tell her no?

20:45.410 --> 20:48.830
Come on. I mean, don't you remember
how awful we felt as kids

20:48.914 --> 20:51.500
when we wanted something
and were always told no?

20:51.583 --> 20:54.711
I mean, we weren't even
allowed to ask for shit.

20:54.795 --> 20:59.883
Oh, I do remember, that's why I put
the Switch on layaway for Christmas.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.345
I did not know that.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.265
Because you did not ask.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.849
You never do.

21:07.933 --> 21:12.229
And even if you did, you would
still go and do what you want to do

21:12.312 --> 21:14.523
because it has to be Lucretia's way.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.526
That's ridiculous.
Look, I just happen to have the means.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.821
Oh, mm-mmm.
No, it is not about your means.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.864
It's about you being a control freak.

21:22.948 --> 21:27.869
Even if you were broke like me,
you would still find a way to take over.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.957
Oh, please. And don't ever
refer to me as broke like you.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.167
I don't even want that
out in the universe.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.797
You see, right?
I mean, you are doing it right now.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.258
You are trying to tell me
how to argue with you.

21:41.341 --> 21:45.220
Look, I'm just trying to give Maya
the party that you wanted to give her.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.139
Yes, the party I wanted to give her,

21:47.222 --> 21:50.058
but now you've given her
the gift I wanted to give her.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.811
Isn't the most important thing
that she's happy?

21:52.894 --> 21:56.690
No. She's gotta know that I did it.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.068
Wow. When did you get so needy?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.654
-[Maya] Mommy?
-Baby, not now, Mommy's winning.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.993
It's not needy.
It's just, without the hugs

22:08.076 --> 22:10.829
and the joy
and the, "You're the best mom,"

22:10.912 --> 22:14.333
I am nothing but a damn chef and a maid.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.335
-Mommy.
-I said not now.

22:16.418 --> 22:19.046
-But, Mommy, my cake is melting.
-What…

22:19.713 --> 22:23.550
Oh, no, Tubby.
You supposed to be the showstopper.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.635
He certainly stopped the show.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.306
Don't worry, Mom, I got this.

22:29.389 --> 22:32.267
Party's over! Everybody go home.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.853
Hey! No, it ain't. No, it ain't. No.

22:34.936 --> 22:38.690
It's a joke, baby.
We doing something new up in here.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.860
It's called… cup of cake.

22:41.943 --> 22:46.031
So, what you do is you grab a cup
and you grab some cake.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.449
Okay? Like this.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.702
Oh, a melted cake.

22:50.786 --> 22:54.706
Uh-uh! It… Look. It's a milkshake cake!

22:57.459 --> 23:00.545
It's a melted cake, Mom.
But it's all we got.

23:04.424 --> 23:07.094
That was not how it was supposed to go.

23:08.136 --> 23:11.473
Look at that mess.
Jesus, you had one job, Regina.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.642
Maya, come here.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.977
I gotta tell you something.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.064
That Switch? That was from your mom.

23:19.731 --> 23:22.067
-Really?
-Okay, no, I'm joking. It was from me.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.153
I love you, Aunt Lucretia.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.534
Okay, it does feel good.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.120
I get it now. I get it.

23:33.203 --> 23:37.040
Where's that back-shooting Tyler.
I wants revenge!

23:37.124 --> 23:39.167
Oh, boy, I'm gonna shoot you now.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.796

23:45.507 --> 23:48.510
-Girl, these kid birthdays wear me out.
-[exhales]

23:48.593 --> 23:51.471
[chuckles] Well, rest up.
You know Bernard's is next month.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.557
Oh, he's out. That's gonna be fun.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.183
[both chuckles]

23:56.810 --> 23:58.895
-Oh, Regina! They know me here.
-Mmm.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.857
What? I'm not spending money on bar wings

24:01.940 --> 24:04.985
when I have perfectly good
party wings in my purse.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.820
Mmm. Sauce mine up.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.497
[Regina] Mmm. Mm-hmm.

24:17.581 --> 24:18.665
You're welcome.

24:22.669 --> 24:23.670
Lucretia?

24:26.131 --> 24:27.132
Frank.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.012
Oh, shit!
