WEBVTT

00:09.967 --> 00:11.700
- Okay, Thunder fam.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.433
Everybody get excited because
we are all going to--

00:20.000 --> 00:21.033
- Even better.

00:21.133 --> 00:24.067
We're going shoe shopping!

00:24.167 --> 00:25.000
- Oh, you guys
are gonna have to go

00:25.100 --> 00:26.367
without me and Phoebe.

00:26.467 --> 00:28.900
We have superhero training
in the house today.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.733
- Training in the hiz-house.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.100
Yeah. I won't do that again.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.467
- I thought you guys
already finished

00:36.567 --> 00:37.467
this week's training.

00:37.567 --> 00:39.300
- Yes, but we have
bonus training.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.933
- Yeah, this one's an elective
extra credit session

00:41.033 --> 00:45.067
where I get to learn how to--
- Ugh, we got it, super nerd.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.467
- Oh, I have training, too.

00:49.567 --> 00:52.000
Band training.

00:52.100 --> 00:55.800
Working on a new song
called Later Losers!

00:55.900 --> 00:59.167
You'll hear it later...losers.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.233
- Okay. Well, everybody who's
not training head to the car.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.900
- I'm buying some shoes-oos.

01:05.067 --> 01:08.067
- And that's how you do it.

01:08.133 --> 01:09.433
- Now, Phoebe.

01:09.533 --> 01:12.600
Today's bonus training
requires focus and hard work...

01:12.700 --> 01:15.700
which is why
we're at the movies instead.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.067
- I can movie hiz-house--

01:19.100 --> 01:20.733
And, technically,
we're still training.

01:20.833 --> 01:25.933
A time to field test
your food tossing abilities.

01:26.067 --> 01:26.867
- Direct hit.

01:26.967 --> 01:28.333
- Shh!

01:28.433 --> 01:30.467
- We're training here!
- We're training here!

01:31.767 --> 01:33.600
- *

01:33.700 --> 01:36.567
- * What you see
is not what you get *

01:36.667 --> 01:39.667
* Living our lives
with a secret *

01:39.767 --> 01:42.867
* We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess *

01:42.967 --> 01:46.367
* Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest *

01:46.467 --> 01:50.100
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

01:50.200 --> 01:53.233
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

01:53.333 --> 01:54.833
* This isn't make-believe

01:54.933 --> 01:56.333
* It's our reality

01:56.433 --> 01:59.300
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

01:59.400 --> 02:01.167
* And stay out of trouble

02:01.267 --> 02:04.167
* Living a double life *

02:09.067 --> 02:11.067
- When I heard they were making
a movie out of a board game,

02:11.133 --> 02:12.300
I had my doubts.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.833
But those hippos
sure were hungry.

02:15.933 --> 02:16.900
- And the best part is,

02:17.067 --> 02:18.733
Mom will never know
we left the house.

02:24.467 --> 02:27.567
Unless she sees
we've been robbed.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.567
Please tell me
you moved all the furniture.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.333
- Do you really think
I would do housework

02:31.433 --> 02:34.267
unless I was forced?

02:34.367 --> 02:36.367
- No. How are we gonna fix this
before Mom gets home?

02:36.467 --> 02:38.200
- That's the next part
of your training, Phoebe.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.700
You're gonna figure out
how to fix this

02:39.800 --> 02:41.767
before Mom gets home.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.200
And...go.

02:52.533 --> 02:53.767
- Whoa.

02:53.867 --> 02:57.267
- Why does it look the old west
puked on Splatburger?

02:57.367 --> 03:00.933
- Yippee-ki-yay, Thunder-dorks.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.567
Are you here for the contest?

03:02.667 --> 03:05.733
- For least likely to pull off
the cowboy look?

03:05.833 --> 03:10.133
'Cause, you already won.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.667
- No, Barbara.

03:12.767 --> 03:16.533
I'm having a contest to promote
my new Southwest burger.

03:16.633 --> 03:20.833
Whoever keeps their hand
on a cactus the longest wins.

03:20.933 --> 03:23.800
- You'd have to be a real
sad sack to sign up for that.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.967
- The winner stars
in a Splatburger commercial.

03:27.067 --> 03:29.233
- ALL: We're in.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.767
- Good. This might be
your family's only shot

03:31.867 --> 03:33.133
at being in a commercial.

03:33.233 --> 03:37.767
They don't usually let
ugly people on TV.

03:37.867 --> 03:39.100
- She's right, guys.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.667
This is once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity

03:40.767 --> 03:43.133
for ugos like us.

03:43.233 --> 03:44.900
- But Wong only said
the last person standing

03:45.067 --> 03:45.867
is the winner.

03:45.967 --> 03:46.800
- Well, that's okay.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.067
We're a family.

03:48.133 --> 03:50.067
If one of us wins, we all win.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.267
- Attention.

03:51.367 --> 03:54.233
We're starting,
you pathetic fame seekers.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.133
Put your hands on a cactus.

03:56.233 --> 03:59.833
Don't worry,
I had the needles removed.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.067
- Ow!

04:01.167 --> 04:03.967
- Oh! Guess I missed a few!

04:04.067 --> 04:05.467
You're out, pigtails.

04:08.533 --> 04:11.067
- I can't believe
they took the couch.

04:11.133 --> 04:16.100
I spent years carving out
the perfect butt groove.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.333
- Oh. I wonder if

04:17.433 --> 04:18.767
the Thunder monitor
saw anything.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.433
What about the pizza
that was inside that box?

04:29.533 --> 04:31.533
This is the worst day
of my life.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.133
It's gonna get
a lot worse when mom finds out

04:33.233 --> 04:35.333
we lied to her about training
and let someone steal

04:35.433 --> 04:37.533
all of our insanely
bright colored furniture.

04:42.633 --> 04:44.967
- Son, we were robbed.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.933
And, yes, they took the pizza.

04:48.067 --> 04:50.500
Animals!

04:53.100 --> 04:54.233
- But that's impossible.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.633
You guys were home training
all day.

04:56.733 --> 05:00.967
- Yes.
Because that was not a lie.

05:06.367 --> 05:10.067
- Why does it smell
like movie popcorn?

05:10.100 --> 05:12.933
- T-t-t-that's not popcorn.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.767
That's dad's cologne.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.433
- It's a butter-based
European scent.

05:17.533 --> 05:19.900
Labouteire.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.167
- Stop it,
I saw you two at the movies!

05:22.267 --> 05:23.767
- Fine, Max. You busted us.

05:23.867 --> 05:25.633
But we've got a bigger problem.

05:25.733 --> 05:28.167
We've gotta find the thief
that stole our stuff.

05:28.267 --> 05:31.467
- You're looking at him.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.067
You don't want Mom to bust you,

05:33.100 --> 05:35.333
but for you
to get your furniture back,

05:35.433 --> 05:38.867
you have to become
my personal assistants.

05:38.967 --> 05:41.067
- He's got us, Phoebe.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.400
- All right.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.833
Well, hey, at least he's not
making us wear weird outfits.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.267
- Oh, you have a run
in your pantyhose.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.467
- I'm not wearing pantyhose.

05:54.567 --> 05:55.900
- Silence, servants!

05:56.067 --> 06:00.467
Phoebe you're my butler,
so make my bed.

06:00.567 --> 06:01.633
Chop, chop!

06:01.733 --> 06:05.067
Move your butt...ler!

06:05.100 --> 06:09.667
- And how about
some fresh paper, Chantel?

06:09.767 --> 06:11.600
That's my new name for you.

06:18.867 --> 06:22.133
Ah-ah, I want it shredded...
like your dignity.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.100
- Mommy, I'm hungry.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.533
- Okay, well you can eat, honey.

06:33.633 --> 06:35.600
We just can't let go
of this cactus.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.567
So just press the buttons
and order for yourself.

06:46.933 --> 06:49.200
- So much power.

06:52.467 --> 06:53.533
- Okay, everyone.

06:53.633 --> 06:57.100
Raise your hand
if you're having fun.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.733
You dummies are out!

07:01.067 --> 07:04.200
- Mrs. Wong just eliminated
most of our competition.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.933
We're in the final four.

07:06.067 --> 07:08.200
- All we have to do
is outlast that guy.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.767
- I am not just any guy.

07:09.867 --> 07:12.700
I am professional
commercial actor Raul.

07:17.367 --> 07:18.900
- That is my cousin.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.133
I pay him
to follow me everywhere.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.500
His name is Gustavo.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.333
- That is Gustavo's cousin.

07:29.433 --> 07:30.667
We are a very talented family.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.133
- Ready to win the contest,
Raul?

07:39.633 --> 07:42.267
Any one of us
could win the contest.

07:42.367 --> 07:44.333
- Fat chance, Barbara.

07:44.433 --> 07:46.367
Raul's going to win.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.867
He's been training
for months for this.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.267
- My calves are like
the trunk of the mighty redwood

07:51.367 --> 07:53.067
that peppers the Cali coast.

07:53.167 --> 07:55.500
- Ah.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.067
- You may have
rigged the contest

07:57.167 --> 07:59.733
with a guy whose calves
can crack a walnut.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.767
- Gracias, chiquita.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.667
- But the Thundermans will not
go down without a fight.

08:05.767 --> 08:08.833
- Fine. Waste your time.

08:08.933 --> 08:11.567
But Raoul will be
the last man standing,

08:11.667 --> 08:14.200
because
he's a certified beefcake.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.367
- It's true.

08:19.467 --> 08:21.067
- This is gonna be hard, guys.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.267
I'm a beefcake,
but I'm not certified.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.900
- Great job, ponies. Break!

08:32.067 --> 08:33.800
Silence!

08:33.900 --> 08:35.700
- We didn't say anything.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.600
- You're breathing too loud.

08:38.700 --> 08:39.833
- Okay. Look, Max.

08:39.933 --> 08:41.167
We played
all your stupid little games,

08:41.267 --> 08:43.100
now just tell us
where you put all our stuff.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.200
- I can't believe
that two of the best superheroes

08:46.300 --> 08:47.600
in the world couldn't find

08:47.700 --> 08:50.233
their own furniture
under their noses...

08:50.333 --> 08:51.633
in the garage.

08:56.467 --> 08:57.367
- It's empty!

08:57.467 --> 08:59.600
- "It's empty."

08:59.700 --> 09:02.533
It's empty!

09:02.633 --> 09:06.100
Guys, our stuff
is really stolen.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.367
Animals!

09:14.067 --> 09:14.733
- Max!

09:14.833 --> 09:16.533
Where is all our furniture?

09:16.633 --> 09:18.733
- Uh, it's right there.

09:22.433 --> 09:23.433
- I'll get him.

09:23.533 --> 09:27.667
Thunderman, away!

09:27.767 --> 09:29.900
- Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

09:31.433 --> 09:34.700
Now where was that hustle
when I was on the rickshaw?

09:34.800 --> 09:36.333
- Okay, somebody else
must have known

09:36.433 --> 09:37.500
the stuff was here.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.833
Did anyone help you
move it into the garage?

09:38.933 --> 09:40.600
- Yeah, but it was someone
I trust.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.833
My buddy Chainsaw.

09:42.933 --> 09:45.100
- You mean Chainsaw
the seven-foot thief

09:45.200 --> 09:46.633
who stole our microwave?

09:46.733 --> 09:48.500
- No, trust me. It wasn't him.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.100
He's given up his life of crime.

09:50.200 --> 09:54.533
He just opened a coffee shop
called Game Of Scones.

09:54.633 --> 09:57.167
- Guys...
your mom will be home soon.

09:57.267 --> 10:00.367
We gotta go down there and see
if Chainsaw has our stuff.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.933
- Fine. To the rickshaw!

10:04.033 --> 10:05.200
No?

10:05.300 --> 10:07.533
I miss having servants.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.100
- RABBIT: I'll serve you!

10:11.533 --> 10:13.633
- Not looking
like that you won't.

10:13.733 --> 10:17.233
- Oh. But it's okay
when your dad wears it.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.533
- Come on.

10:19.633 --> 10:21.833
- Wait, take me with you!

10:21.933 --> 10:25.167
Humans!

10:29.733 --> 10:31.000
- Senorita Wong,

10:31.100 --> 10:33.000
this massage feels like
a thousand butterflies

10:33.100 --> 10:36.400
dancing on the perfectly
sculpted back of Raoul.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.500
- It's not fair.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.333
Mrs. Wong is playing dirty.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.833
We need to play dirty too.

10:43.933 --> 10:44.700
- Nora.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.300
Two Wongs don't make a right.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.067
Yeah I said it.

10:49.167 --> 10:51.967
The Thundermans always play
by the rules.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.600
- What are you looking at,
mom jeans?

10:57.067 --> 11:00.833
- Okay.
Now it's on like donkey wong.

11:00.933 --> 11:02.267
Yeah, I said that too!

11:10.933 --> 11:14.200
- My back! My beautiful back!

11:14.300 --> 11:15.833
- He took his hand off!

11:15.933 --> 11:19.167
- You ruined my commercial,
you handsome idiot.

11:19.267 --> 11:20.933
- Aye! No need to shove!

11:21.067 --> 11:24.100
Gustavo and Gustavo's cousin
will play me out.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.733
- We did it!

11:30.833 --> 11:32.533
Okay, you guys
can take your hands off

11:32.633 --> 11:34.133
and let me win now.

11:36.133 --> 11:39.133
This uncertified beefcake
is gonna win.

11:39.233 --> 11:43.067
- Yeah, right.
That commercial is mine.

11:43.100 --> 11:43.767
That's right.

11:43.867 --> 11:45.333
The bow came off.

11:45.433 --> 11:48.667
Be afraid, people.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.067
- But I have to win.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.500
I'm the only one
with any acting experience

11:52.600 --> 11:54.833
thanks to my hit
Electriss medical drama

11:54.933 --> 11:57.233
Super Strong Medicine.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.433
- We're losing him, doctor!

11:58.533 --> 12:01.067
- Not on my watch!

12:01.100 --> 12:03.133
Dr. Electriss will fix this.

12:05.233 --> 12:06.367
Clear!

12:06.467 --> 12:08.067
- Urgh.

12:10.333 --> 12:13.200
- Now that's
some super strong medicine.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.867
- I guess we have
a three-way stand-off.

12:19.967 --> 12:23.600
- Mom, you should go check on
Chloe like a good parent.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.333
- Nice try.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.933
Chloe, honey, are you okay?

12:28.067 --> 12:31.600
- Never better, baby.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.367
- Look! It's all our stuff.

12:46.467 --> 12:47.633
- Okay, hold on.

12:47.733 --> 12:48.933
Maybe Chainsaw just has

12:49.067 --> 12:50.833
the same taste in furniture
as us.

12:50.933 --> 12:52.767
- MONITOR: Alert. Alert.

12:52.867 --> 12:57.400
Today's special is a half café,
no whip macchiato.

12:57.500 --> 13:00.400
- Okay, I see it now.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.167
- That must be Chainsaw.

13:02.267 --> 13:04.067
I'll handle this.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.833
- Listen, Bub, you can't just--

13:05.933 --> 13:09.933
Ooh, are those
cran

13:10.067 --> 13:12.333
- Chainsaw, give us back
the stuff you stole.

13:12.433 --> 13:13.600
- I didn't steal nothing.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.233
- Our family portrait
is on the wall!

13:19.300 --> 13:20.733
- You told me you were
getting rid of this stuff

13:20.833 --> 13:22.167
for a garage sale.

13:22.267 --> 13:25.733
- But you still took it all
without paying.

13:25.833 --> 13:28.067
- I slipped a green envelope
full of fat cash

13:28.100 --> 13:29.833
through your basement window.

13:33.467 --> 13:36.467
- RABBIT: I want it shredded,
like your dignity.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.967
- I'll shred you.

13:39.067 --> 13:42.633
- That's the stuff. Yeah.

13:42.733 --> 13:45.567
- Yeah, that money's gone.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.733
- Then the furniture stays.

13:47.833 --> 13:49.267
- Hey!

13:49.367 --> 13:50.933
That's my wedding china!

13:51.067 --> 13:53.200
- Oops.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.967
- This is all your fault.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.767
You just had to mess with me
and dad, didn't you?

13:59.867 --> 14:01.100
- I should have done it sooner.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.400
I've seen you guys use
bonus training as an excuse

14:03.500 --> 14:06.700
to ride bikes,
play mini golf and scuba dive.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.833
- Wait a second.

14:07.933 --> 14:09.833
Have you been following us
everywhere?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.067
No.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.067
I just happen to be
at all those places

14:14.100 --> 14:15.800
and the basketball game
where you guys hit

14:15.900 --> 14:17.767
the neigh-neigh
on the jumbo trunk.

14:17.867 --> 14:20.567
- You have been following us.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.133
Wait.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.533
Are you jealous that I've been
spending so much time with Dad?

14:24.633 --> 14:27.733
Aww, you miss your daddy.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.467
Like I'd even hit
the whip and neigh-neigh

14:30.567 --> 14:33.200
with that goober.

14:33.300 --> 14:36.067
- Get your boney hipster heinys
out of my butt groove.

14:36.167 --> 14:36.867
- Hey!

14:36.967 --> 14:38.233
Seating tight in here.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.833
If you wanted somewhere to sit,

14:39.933 --> 14:41.400
you should have bought
a bigger couch.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.500
- Whoo.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.233
- Hold on. I think I just
thought of a way out of this.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.533
Yo, Chainsaw!

14:47.633 --> 14:48.933
I see you're pressed for space.

14:49.067 --> 14:51.733
Why don't we have ourselves
a little contest.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.833
If we win,
we get all of our furniture back

14:53.933 --> 14:55.767
and if you win--
- You get our house.

14:58.167 --> 14:59.267
- I was gonna volunteer

14:59.367 --> 15:02.600
to have Dad
take down a few walls.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.967
- Oh, I like her idea better.

15:06.067 --> 15:06.967
- Too late.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.333
I want your house.

15:08.433 --> 15:10.267
- The only way
I'll agree to this

15:10.367 --> 15:12.833
is if we get to pick
the challenge.

15:13.967 --> 15:15.267
Bare knuckle boxing?

15:15.367 --> 15:17.067
Knife fight?

15:17.133 --> 15:20.467
- Or...something
a little less prison-y.

15:20.567 --> 15:24.067
Uh, like, food tossing.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.733
- Fools.

15:26.833 --> 15:30.067
Food toss
is the number-one prison game.

15:30.167 --> 15:31.933
My daughter and I play it
every day.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.867
Yo, Hacksaw!

15:33.967 --> 15:35.333
Hit me!

15:39.200 --> 15:40.400
- Should have gone knife fight.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.467
- Wow.

15:45.567 --> 15:48.633
You guys have been at this
for a long time.

15:48.733 --> 15:52.433
Betcha have to go
to the bathroom.

15:52.533 --> 15:53.567
- Nope.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.700
My second super power
is bladder control.

15:55.800 --> 15:59.067
I haven't peed since February.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.100
- I'm surprised you don't
have to go, Mom.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.733
You've had a lot of water.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.233
- No, I haven't.

16:05.333 --> 16:08.067
- Oh, well, you're about to.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.900
- Oh! You'll pay for that.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.767
Actually, let me pay all--

16:16.867 --> 16:20.500
- --charges.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.767
- I never noticed how different
your hair looks without a bow.

16:24.800 --> 16:29.467
- What in the name
of casual dining have you done?

16:29.567 --> 16:33.067
- I couldn't decide.

16:33.133 --> 16:34.667
- ALL: Chloe!

16:34.767 --> 16:36.667
- We were so worried
about winning the contest,

16:36.767 --> 16:39.400
we left Chloe all alone.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.300
- Thundermans,
clean up this mess,

16:41.400 --> 16:43.400
we have a commercial to shoot!

16:43.500 --> 16:44.967
- Yeah.

16:45.067 --> 16:49.567
You all let go at the same time,
so you losers win.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.100
- Thank you!

16:51.200 --> 16:53.500
But what are we gonna do
with all this food?

16:53.600 --> 16:54.633
- Fear not, chiquita.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.067
- I am as hungry
as I am handsome.

17:05.533 --> 17:09.100
- Okay. You and I
are gonna save our house.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.467
Practice toss.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.833
- Ow.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.967
Sorry, got distracted by Max.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.300
- Phoebe, whatever Max is doing
won't matter

17:18.400 --> 17:21.333
if we're living in a van
down by the river.

17:21.433 --> 17:24.467
- It's just, he won't admit it,
but I think Max is bummed

17:24.567 --> 17:26.133
that you guys
don't hang out as much as we do.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.300
We hang out.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.767
I mean just last week we...oh.

17:30.867 --> 17:33.100
Well, there was the time
where--oh.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.833
We just neigh-neighed
at the basketball game.

17:36.933 --> 17:38.867
- That was us.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.800
- Oh. We really don't hang out.

17:41.900 --> 17:42.833
How did this happen?

17:42.933 --> 17:44.800
He probably thinks I'm a goober.

17:46.067 --> 17:48.300
No.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.267
- Ah, I know what you're
trying to tell me.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.067
Max.

17:52.167 --> 17:53.767
Phoebe's out. You're in.

17:53.867 --> 17:55.600
That's not what I meant.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.733
You guys really need
to let me finish my thoughts.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.600
- You want me to do this
with you?

18:00.700 --> 18:01.800
- Of course!

18:01.900 --> 18:04.267
I love eating,
you love throwing things at me.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.300
We're the dream team.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.167
- All right, food toss.

18:07.267 --> 18:08.433
Street rules.

18:08.533 --> 18:10.733
You make a shot,
the other team has to match it.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.067
Crybabies go first.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.733
- Oh, no fair.
We wanna go first!

18:13.833 --> 18:14.967
Oh, we're the crybabies.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.867
All right.

18:16.967 --> 18:18.467
Okay, Max.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.333
- See if you can handle
this hook shot.

18:25.767 --> 18:27.600
- In your face!

18:27.700 --> 18:29.400
That is to say, you're up.
I'm sorry.

18:38.533 --> 18:39.967
- Enough of the baby stuff.

18:40.067 --> 18:43.300
Next shot,
over the shoulder backwards.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.533
- Okay, here it comes, dad.

19:06.733 --> 19:07.633
- You got lucky.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.333
When we win,
I'm turning your bedroom

19:09.433 --> 19:11.833
into a lair where I can do
all my evil stuff.

19:12.967 --> 19:16.100
It'll be easier than you think.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.600
- Uh, guys.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.067
I can't be
the protector of Hiddenville,

19:21.133 --> 19:22.667
if I don't live in Hiddenville.

19:23.767 --> 19:24.667
- This is a bad idea.

19:24.767 --> 19:25.900
You should be doing this
with Phoebe.

19:26.067 --> 19:27.100
You guys are better at this.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.067
- No, son.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.100
This is you and me.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.200
I mean, what are they?

19:32.300 --> 19:33.700
A father/daughter team?

19:33.800 --> 19:35.100
We're a father/son team.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.633
That's way better!

19:37.733 --> 19:40.967
- I'm just gonna assume
that's the scones talking.

19:41.067 --> 19:43.333
- This is our time.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.933
You pick the shot,
I will have your back.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.067
- Okay, Dad.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.067
Let's go whip
their neigh-neighs!

19:50.133 --> 19:53.200
- Should have just gone
shoe shopping.

19:53.300 --> 19:56.133
- Ooh! What about
your couch butt groove?

19:56.233 --> 19:59.867
You've worn out all the springs
except one.

20:00.067 --> 20:03.300
- Milton, the most stubborn
spring of them all.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.633
Great idea, Max.

20:05.733 --> 20:08.233
- Guess I should start
saying goodbye to all our stuff.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.967
Goodbye, chairs.

20:10.067 --> 20:11.500
Goodbye, penguin butler.

20:12.967 --> 20:14.633
- Okay. We call the shot.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.133
Off my dad's butt groove.

20:21.233 --> 20:22.400
Nothing but .

20:22.500 --> 20:24.667
- Done. We'll even go first.

20:24.767 --> 20:26.800
I've gotta get home
and feed my bats.

20:37.067 --> 20:38.133
- Come on, Hacks.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.833
You're a disgrace
to the Saw family name.

20:39.933 --> 20:41.033
- Don't blame me.

20:41.133 --> 20:44.667
The old man's butt
crushed that cushion's soul.

20:44.767 --> 20:45.600
- Not all of it.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.900
Aim for Milton.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.767
- *

21:14.867 --> 21:16.967
Now you have no place to sit.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.233
- That's my boy!

21:19.333 --> 21:21.633
All right, guys.
Let's go home.

21:22.667 --> 21:23.833
- Oh right, the furniture.

21:23.933 --> 21:25.267
- Yeah.

21:28.733 --> 21:32.100
- Mom! The Splatburger
commercial is coming on.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.133
Come on.

21:34.233 --> 21:36.067
- Why does the couch
smell like coffee?

21:36.100 --> 21:38.433
- Oh, shh, it's starting!

21:38.533 --> 21:39.767
Yee-ha!

21:39.867 --> 21:42.767
How good is Splatburger's
new Southwest burger?

21:42.867 --> 21:46.067
Well, just ask
these little piggies.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.867
- I can't believe it.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.900
- I know.

22:03.067 --> 22:06.067
We're famous!

22:10.900 --> 22:15.467
- *
