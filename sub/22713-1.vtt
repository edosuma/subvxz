04:46.629 --> 04:49.064
Hey, I'm really sorry to bug you.

04:49.065 --> 04:53.102
I was just wondering if
you can hear that noise.

04:56.539 --> 04:57.906
No.

04:57.907 --> 05:01.210
It sounds like an engine or something.

05:03.980 --> 05:06.047
I don't hear it.

05:06.048 --> 05:07.616
How can you not hear that?

05:07.617 --> 05:10.586
I just don't, sorry.

05:10.587 --> 05:13.855
You know what, I think I hear it in here too.

05:13.856 --> 05:14.891
Hear what?

05:16.559 --> 05:18.359
Do you wanna come over to my apartment

05:18.360 --> 05:20.061
to see if you can hear it in there?

05:20.062 --> 05:24.365
I'm sorry it's just really
getting on my nerves.

05:33.142 --> 05:34.010
Hear it?

05:37.546 --> 05:38.414
Maybe.

05:42.084 --> 05:44.720
No, I don't. Sorry.

05:44.721 --> 05:47.989
I don't hear it.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.302
Sally, go away.

06:08.678 --> 06:13.782
Whatever is happening to
me isn't going to stop.

06:13.783 --> 06:18.519
Every cell in my body is dying.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.723
There is no more solution.

06:32.134 --> 06:35.171
Turn it down, I'm trying to sleep.

07:14.543 --> 07:16.278
Can you hear that?

07:18.848 --> 07:20.448
I can hear it.

07:20.449 --> 07:21.317
You can?

07:23.252 --> 07:24.120
Yes.

07:26.088 --> 07:27.155
And it is not pleasant.

07:27.156 --> 07:28.589
No, it isn't.

07:28.590 --> 07:32.328
You called, you said
something about the bedroom?

07:35.798 --> 07:37.565
I don't think it's comin'
from in there, though.

07:37.566 --> 07:39.500
I think it's comin' from down in the kitchen.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.869
You know, sound is funny like that.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.637
Bounces around inside the walls.

07:42.638 --> 07:44.973
You think it's coming from one place,
and it's actually coming from someplace

07:44.974 --> 07:46.776
completely different.

08:32.087 --> 08:34.222
- Could you move this?
- Oh!

09:25.707 --> 09:28.243
Why are you doing that?

09:28.244 --> 09:31.013
I'm trying to get a line on it.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.405
I'm gonna go down to the basement,

09:57.406 --> 09:59.540
see if there's somethin' up with the furnace.

09:59.541 --> 10:00.910
And then what?

10:04.780 --> 10:06.281
I don't know.

10:06.282 --> 10:09.784
I can't make it go away if
I don't know what it is.

10:09.785 --> 10:11.820
I gotta get out of here.

10:52.794 --> 10:55.065
I don't know what this thing is, okay?

10:57.066 --> 11:00.135
Maybe it's not even coming
from inside this building.

11:00.136 --> 11:05.340
Whatever this thing is, maybe you're
just getting the most of it in here.

11:05.341 --> 11:06.207
Can you come back inside?

11:06.208 --> 11:09.110
I don't know what else to tell ya,
lady, okay? Everybody hears noises.

11:09.111 --> 11:12.313
Could you at least help me move
my appliances back where they go?

11:12.314 --> 11:14.682
Aren't you gonna figure out what this is?

11:14.683 --> 11:16.684
Ma'am, maybe if this
thing keeps botherin' you,

11:16.685 --> 11:19.555
think about movin' somewhere else.

11:33.369 --> 11:36.236
Shut up!

11:39.241 --> 11:41.109
Stop!

11:51.753 --> 11:53.621
Stop!

15:51.927 --> 15:53.794
Oh God!

15:53.995 --> 15:55.330
You scared me.

15:55.331 --> 15:58.233
You're not allowed to have food here.

15:58.234 --> 16:00.668
Well, I was asked to stay late, and so...

16:00.669 --> 16:01.970
Throw it out.

16:10.078 --> 16:12.847
Do you think you're special?

16:12.848 --> 16:13.681
Come on.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.816
Answer the question.

16:15.817 --> 16:18.753
What makes you special?

16:22.591 --> 16:23.691
Nothing.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.260
Right.

16:25.261 --> 16:29.962
You are... not special,

16:30.466 --> 16:31.333
Natalie.

16:33.001 --> 16:34.535
Dr. Flint.

16:34.536 --> 16:40.107
It would be a shame it
anyone were to hear about this

16:40.108 --> 16:42.911
lapse, Doctor.

17:01.397 --> 17:03.264
Lock up when you're finished.

17:03.265 --> 17:04.933
And lights out!

17:15.877 --> 17:16.744
Asshole.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.000
Piece of shit.

18:37.893 --> 18:39.928
Fuck, I need more sleep.

18:52.007 --> 18:55.010
Okay, not funny.

18:55.577 --> 18:56.612
Who's there?

19:37.986 --> 19:38.854
No!

20:17.893 --> 20:18.760
Oh fuck!

20:23.932 --> 20:24.800
No!

20:28.236 --> 20:29.771
You fucking bitch.

21:25.060 --> 21:26.694
Oh fuck!

21:36.071 --> 21:37.538
Oh my God!

21:58.927 --> 22:01.729
Where the fuck are you going?

22:01.730 --> 22:03.431
Get out of my way!

22:55.951 --> 22:57.818
Fucking amateur.

23:55.276 --> 23:57.979
It's alright, I can handle it.

24:40.188 --> 24:41.922
Lovely to meet you, Jenna.

24:41.923 --> 24:45.626
I'm Dr. Kelly, your consultant this morning.

24:59.407 --> 25:00.876
Thank you, Alicia.

25:05.413 --> 25:07.614
Just some maintenance today?

25:07.615 --> 25:08.483
Fantastic.

25:30.271 --> 25:31.139
You...

25:48.589 --> 25:49.457
Oh!

28:14.236 --> 28:14.903
No!

28:15.404 --> 28:16.103
No!

28:16.104 --> 28:19.106
If I can't be beautiful,
I might as well be...

29:02.450 --> 29:04.485
Sorry about that, Jenna.

29:06.087 --> 29:08.355
Why don't you sit down,

29:08.356 --> 29:11.225
and we'll make sure that you, at least,

29:11.226 --> 29:13.494
don't go home disappointed.

30:54.762 --> 30:57.632
♪ She's beautiful ♪

30:58.533 --> 31:02.836
♪ As she walks into the room ♪

31:02.837 --> 31:06.706
♪ The way she flicks her hair ♪

31:06.707 --> 31:11.611
♪ My heart goes boom, boom, boom ♪

31:11.612 --> 31:14.982
♪ She's my perfect girl ♪

31:17.218 --> 31:19.987
♪ And I love her ♪

31:56.090 --> 31:58.959
I want you to relax, Ella.

32:00.295 --> 32:01.396
Deep breaths.

32:04.532 --> 32:06.401
Now, take me with you.

32:08.536 --> 32:12.572
Take me back to where you first remember.

32:12.573 --> 32:14.542
Before it all happened.

32:16.577 --> 32:17.945
What do you see?

32:21.416 --> 32:22.950
It's dark

32:24.752 --> 32:25.953
all around me.

32:29.490 --> 32:33.694
I can't see the sky because of
the trees, they're too tall.

32:35.763 --> 32:38.032
Are we in a forest?

32:39.033 --> 32:40.134
Yes.

32:41.269 --> 32:44.037
Have you been there before?

32:44.038 --> 32:46.574
Daddy brings me here.

32:47.675 --> 32:50.310
Can you describe to me what you hear?

32:50.311 --> 32:51.612
What you smell?

32:55.283 --> 32:56.884
It's cold.

32:58.419 --> 33:00.153
I'm scared.

33:00.154 --> 33:02.890
Why are you scared, Ella?

33:04.425 --> 33:06.726
They're watching me.

33:06.727 --> 33:07.927
Who?

33:07.928 --> 33:09.530
Who's watching you?

33:10.931 --> 33:13.367
They don't like me talking about them.

33:13.368 --> 33:15.403
Daddy says they'll know.

33:16.371 --> 33:18.004
Who will know?

33:18.005 --> 33:19.339
They will.

33:19.340 --> 33:21.442
Who's they, Ella?

33:22.510 --> 33:25.512
It's okay, you're safe here.

33:25.513 --> 33:27.381
Nobody can hurt you.

33:27.382 --> 33:30.684
The only people in this room are you and me.

33:30.685 --> 33:32.252
Daddy, no!

33:32.253 --> 33:33.920
Ella, listen to me.

33:33.921 --> 33:35.889
Use my voice as a light.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.757
I need you to run towards the light.

33:37.758 --> 33:41.962
Listen to my voice.

34:48.362 --> 34:50.965
How are we feeling today, Ella?

34:53.033 --> 34:56.737
Any improvements since our last appointment?

34:59.774 --> 35:03.911
Well, I take it the new drugs
have proven helpful.

35:11.919 --> 35:14.689
You're the doctor, you tell me.

35:20.561 --> 35:24.998
Still lugging that thing
around to do your job for you.

35:24.999 --> 35:27.702
It's a tool, like many others.

35:29.236 --> 35:33.473
All of which assist me in
diagnosing my patients.

35:33.474 --> 35:35.109
So I can help them.

35:36.877 --> 35:38.478
To save you having to listen

35:38.479 --> 35:41.115
when your patients talk, right?

35:42.483 --> 35:43.350
I get it.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.249
Your evaluation day's coming up.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.552
I've had a word to the review
board about your release,

36:18.553 --> 36:20.119
- and I believe...
- Let's see.

36:20.120 --> 36:25.058
I slip into my Sunday best
while you parade me before them

36:25.059 --> 36:27.894
and recommend that I stay here longer

36:27.895 --> 36:30.129
for further observation?

36:30.130 --> 36:32.666
Spare me the why games, Kay.

36:32.667 --> 36:34.734
It's my job to figure out why, Ella,

36:34.735 --> 36:37.505
so I do what's right to help you.

36:38.906 --> 36:43.109
Like you haven't done
since I was a little girl?

36:43.110 --> 36:47.147
You think I don't remember
your games back then?

36:50.017 --> 36:50.985
I remember.

36:53.020 --> 36:56.390
But nothing you say is going to help me.

36:57.492 --> 36:59.959
You have to want me to help you, Ella.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.795
Then we can figure out why it is

37:01.796 --> 37:04.197
you're having these hallucinations.

37:04.198 --> 37:07.968
That's a little odd, when you never listen.

37:09.570 --> 37:12.405
You can play my voice back all you want.

37:12.406 --> 37:14.908
You can study ever bullshit
drawing I give you,

37:14.909 --> 37:21.113
but, until you see what it
is I'm trying to show you,

37:21.516 --> 37:23.383
you're not helping me.

37:24.318 --> 37:25.185
Only them.

37:26.721 --> 37:29.288
We have been through this before, haven't we?

37:29.289 --> 37:31.758
These visions you're having,

37:31.759 --> 37:34.193
they're simply remnants,

37:34.194 --> 37:38.398
repressed memories of the trauma
you experienced as a child.

37:39.266 --> 37:42.468
But we can make them go away.

37:42.469 --> 37:43.504
I have hope.

37:45.773 --> 37:48.608
Because you have all the answers.

37:48.609 --> 37:52.946
Why don't we start again from the beginning?

37:52.947 --> 37:55.582
I'm done and you're out of tools for me

37:55.583 --> 37:57.617
to waste my time drawing with.

37:57.618 --> 37:59.052
So, jot down whatever it is

37:59.053 --> 38:00.987
you came here to validate yourself with

38:00.988 --> 38:06.192
while that thing's still
recording and leave me be.

38:20.975 --> 38:22.342
I'm listening.

38:32.019 --> 38:32.887
That day,

38:35.122 --> 38:38.758
when the policemen found me and

38:39.126 --> 38:41.495
I was brought in to see you,

38:43.097 --> 38:44.464
they were there.

38:46.100 --> 38:47.902
In that room with us.

38:49.837 --> 38:50.871
Who?

38:53.507 --> 38:54.775
You see them.

38:56.611 --> 38:58.979
In the corners of your eyes.

38:59.980 --> 39:01.048
Like shadows.

39:04.018 --> 39:07.286
They want you to know that they're there,

39:07.287 --> 39:09.156
that they're watching.

39:10.791 --> 39:16.161
And these shadows, you still see them?

39:19.634 --> 39:21.602
Only when I'm afraid.

39:22.770 --> 39:25.640
And what makes you afraid?

39:27.842 --> 39:28.709
They do.

39:29.844 --> 39:32.779
Can you tell me more about them?

39:32.780 --> 39:33.648
It's okay.

39:34.649 --> 39:37.250
Like I've said, they're just

39:37.251 --> 39:38.118
memories.

39:39.086 --> 39:40.187
Bad memories.

39:41.889 --> 39:44.557
But nothing in them is real.

39:44.558 --> 39:45.860
But they are.

39:48.528 --> 39:49.496
I see them.

39:51.832 --> 39:53.801
They make me do things.

39:54.802 --> 39:57.170
Things I don't want to.

39:57.171 --> 39:58.872
If you just let me help you, Ella,

39:58.873 --> 40:01.909
- I can make them go away.
- You can't.

40:03.077 --> 40:07.146
Not unless I give them what they want.

40:07.147 --> 40:10.617
He said that was the only way to be free.

40:11.886 --> 40:15.422
These shadow people, they told you this.

40:18.659 --> 40:23.262
But I figured it out,
that's why daddy did it.

40:23.263 --> 40:25.232
Was to be free of them.

40:26.500 --> 40:30.436
He said that we could be together again,

40:30.437 --> 40:33.206
all I needed was a trade.

40:33.207 --> 40:37.176
An eye for an eye, like he made with me.

40:44.051 --> 40:45.753
Run on home, Ella.

40:47.354 --> 40:51.458
Things in this world I
can't make you understand.

40:53.460 --> 40:57.064
He said that was the only way to save me.

40:58.198 --> 40:59.833
He was wrong.

40:59.834 --> 41:00.835
They want...

41:08.275 --> 41:09.809
I tried to warn you.

41:09.810 --> 41:13.513
I tried to make you believe that they exist.

41:15.415 --> 41:17.516
What will it take for you to believe me.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.386
I do believe you, Ella.

41:20.387 --> 41:22.789
All I want is to help you, trust me,

41:22.790 --> 41:24.323
and I will do everything I can

41:24.324 --> 41:28.095
so you don't have to be afraid anymore, okay?

41:33.968 --> 41:36.702
However, I believe it's
best for your own safety

41:36.703 --> 41:39.973
if you stay here under observation
for another few months.

41:39.974 --> 41:43.077
Now, once the review board can see...

42:06.633 --> 42:09.068
Get paramedics in here, now.

42:09.069 --> 42:09.937
Hurry!

42:24.118 --> 42:27.020
But I figured it out.

42:27.021 --> 42:31.557
That's why daddy did it
was to be free of them.

42:31.558 --> 42:33.927
All I needed was a trade.

42:33.928 --> 42:38.297
An eye for an eye, like he made with me.

43:49.603 --> 43:51.071
Tomorrow night.

43:52.139 --> 43:54.408
We deserve a bed this time.

44:36.816 --> 44:39.253
Don't look at me like that.

44:42.189 --> 44:45.191
The 8:30 Herswich train
has been delayed.

44:45.192 --> 44:48.996
The next train is the South Lorraine service.

44:52.166 --> 44:55.936
South Lorraine service stopping all stations.

45:50.590 --> 45:52.959
You reading that?

45:57.231 --> 45:59.099
No, you can have it.

49:58.372 --> 50:03.876
Heed this one warning and
spare yourself an eternity here.

50:04.444 --> 50:09.682
The next ticket I hand
out will be one way only.

52:15.575 --> 52:16.843
Excuse me, sir.

52:17.711 --> 52:19.746
I believe this is yours.

53:25.645 --> 53:26.513
Gran?

54:21.601 --> 54:22.468
Gran?

59:58.037 --> 59:59.472
Don't leave me.

01:00:01.007 --> 01:00:01.975
Stay put.

01:00:51.124 --> 01:00:51.991
Dad?

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:20.752
I hate eggs.

01:01:20.753 --> 01:01:22.487
Mom knows that.

01:01:22.488 --> 01:01:24.722
Your aunt's here to help.

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.592
I can make pancakes?

01:01:40.206 --> 01:01:41.074
Scarlet.

01:01:43.509 --> 01:01:44.809
Scarlet!

01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:46.078
This is hard on all of us!

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:49.714
Why don't you get her back then!

01:01:49.715 --> 01:01:50.615
I hate you!

01:01:50.616 --> 01:01:51.584
I hate you!

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:56.289
She'll be at grandpa's.

01:02:12.505 --> 01:02:14.572
Linda, he was my boy too!

01:02:14.573 --> 01:02:17.610
It's your fault he's dead!

01:06:52.651 --> 01:06:55.153
It bangs, just like bwah.

01:06:55.754 --> 01:06:59.124
Come on, let's take it out for a spin.

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:01.693
Mom ran out on dad again.

01:07:01.694 --> 01:07:04.397
It was my brother's anniversary.

01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:07.100
He would've been nine.

01:07:12.171 --> 01:07:15.473
Fuck, I love your body.

01:07:15.474 --> 01:07:16.342
Get out.

01:07:49.175 --> 01:07:50.909
So, tell me, Mr. Kennedy.

01:07:52.979 --> 01:07:55.348
Does she like it in the ass?

01:12:48.241 --> 01:12:49.275
I'm sorry.

01:12:53.479 --> 01:12:55.380
Dad?

01:13:34.887 --> 01:13:36.587
Go and take photos of someone else.

01:13:36.588 --> 01:13:38.622
Oh, but you're so cute.

01:13:38.623 --> 01:13:40.291
You're lucky.

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:41.159
Ready?

01:13:47.532 --> 01:13:49.901
Don't put that on me, don't touch me.

01:13:49.902 --> 01:13:51.035
Stop it!

01:13:51.036 --> 01:13:52.503
- Are you drunk?
- No.

01:13:52.504 --> 01:13:53.604
- You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

01:13:53.605 --> 01:13:55.572
You are drunk, look at you.

01:13:55.573 --> 01:13:56.608
Look at you.

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:02.046
There's another way to do it, you know?

01:14:02.047 --> 01:14:04.481
Does this rag smell like chloroform to you?

01:14:10.588 --> 01:14:12.423
What about Sonny?

01:14:12.424 --> 01:14:13.991
That's a boy.

01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:15.392
That's a boy.

01:14:15.393 --> 01:14:16.929
That's a good boy.

01:14:25.237 --> 01:14:27.138
So, I never understood
why he used to say

01:14:27.139 --> 01:14:29.907
it was exactly like a toy car.

01:14:29.908 --> 01:14:31.275
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:14:31.276 --> 01:14:32.144
No.

01:14:33.478 --> 01:14:35.312
Goodnight.

01:14:35.313 --> 01:14:36.348
Goodnight.

01:14:39.051 --> 01:14:39.918
Stop it!

01:14:43.455 --> 01:14:44.956
Goodnight!

01:14:44.957 --> 01:14:46.791
Alright, this is what I am now.

01:14:46.792 --> 01:14:49.928
- I'm just everybody's slave.
- Yes.

01:15:10.983 --> 01:15:12.183
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:12.184 --> 01:15:13.517
Didn't you hear those possums last night?

01:15:13.518 --> 01:15:14.786
Man they were noisy.

01:15:14.787 --> 01:15:15.987
I didn't hear anything.

01:15:15.988 --> 01:15:19.023
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:19.024 --> 01:15:20.157
What are you doing?

01:15:20.158 --> 01:15:21.392
What?

01:15:21.393 --> 01:15:24.195
You are five, you are a five year old child.

01:15:24.196 --> 01:15:25.462
Did you break this?

01:15:25.463 --> 01:15:26.663
No.

01:15:26.664 --> 01:15:27.999
Well, it was outside your room.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Doesn't mean I broke it.

01:15:29.001 --> 01:15:30.667
Can you fix it?

01:15:30.668 --> 01:15:31.602
She's not gonna be happy.

01:15:31.603 --> 01:15:34.038
Oi, less talkin' more walkin'.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.274
Hey, Megs.

01:15:37.275 --> 01:15:39.276
Don't forget your snack.

01:15:39.277 --> 01:15:40.544
What is wrong with you?

01:15:40.545 --> 01:15:42.479
Come on, it's full of vitamin B and C!

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.114
Shut up!

01:15:43.115 --> 01:15:46.084
- Balls and cock.
- Shut up!

01:15:50.856 --> 01:15:52.624
It's pretty though.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.160
Where'd Chris go?

01:15:56.161 --> 01:16:00.464
Boo!

01:16:00.465 --> 01:16:01.899
What are you scared of?

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.134
Did you think I was a ghost or something?

01:16:03.135 --> 01:16:04.635
No.

01:16:04.636 --> 01:16:07.038
Although you do know they
bury dead bodies out here.

01:16:07.039 --> 01:16:07.905
- Don't you?
- Hilarious.

01:16:07.906 --> 01:16:08.739
True story.

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:12.043
No, it's a thing, because the forest
is really dense up here.

01:16:12.044 --> 01:16:13.410
Apparently the Danny Long Range

01:16:13.411 --> 01:16:16.013
is just packed full of dead bodies.

01:16:16.014 --> 01:16:18.349
And I heard this thing, I kid you not.

01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:21.853
- If you're one of the people who can...
- Stop it, don't throw things.

01:16:21.854 --> 01:16:26.290
If you can see dead bodies, apparently
like the edge of Sherbrooke Forest

01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:28.893
is just littered with
ghosts just standing there,

01:16:28.894 --> 01:16:30.461
because they don't wanna
be alone in the forest,

01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:32.196
they come to the edge
and they just stand there

01:16:32.197 --> 01:16:35.332
and watch all the people
and that sort of stuff.

01:16:35.333 --> 01:16:36.800
If he can see ghosts.

01:16:38.401 --> 01:16:40.401
Let's go parley. Let's go parley.

01:16:42.402 --> 01:16:44.402
Photo time.

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:53.684
Okay, ready?

01:16:53.685 --> 01:16:55.053
One, two, three.

01:16:59.191 --> 01:17:01.525
So, we gonna go to bed soon?

01:17:01.526 --> 01:17:04.796
I think so, I'm gettin' pretty tired.

01:17:05.864 --> 01:17:08.465
You gonna be going to bed alone?

01:17:08.466 --> 01:17:12.669
Any of you cunts wanna throw
firecrackers in the nude?

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:13.971
No?

01:17:13.972 --> 01:17:15.539
Just me then.

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.408
Righty o.

01:18:17.602 --> 01:18:19.070
Honey?

01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:20.605
Did you hear that?

01:18:21.873 --> 01:18:22.740
Honey!

01:18:23.775 --> 01:18:25.542
Someone was in the room.

01:18:25.543 --> 01:18:26.510
What?

01:18:26.511 --> 01:18:28.745
Someone was in here.

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.181
Oh, go back to sleep.

01:18:30.182 --> 01:18:31.049
Honey!

01:18:33.318 --> 01:18:34.519
Fuck's sake.

01:18:37.655 --> 01:18:39.223
Guys, did you hear anything?

01:18:39.224 --> 01:18:40.925
What's the matter?

01:18:42.094 --> 01:18:44.129
What the hell is this?

01:18:54.739 --> 01:18:55.606
Okay, everybody outside.

01:18:55.607 --> 01:18:57.074
Where's Chris?

01:18:57.075 --> 01:18:58.409
- Everybody get outside.
- Where is Chris?

01:18:58.410 --> 01:19:00.111
Michael, take them outside.

01:19:00.112 --> 01:19:01.212
Come on, let's go.

01:19:01.213 --> 01:19:02.313
Come on, Shelly, let's go.

01:19:02.314 --> 01:19:04.182
Let's get out of here.

01:19:46.624 --> 01:19:47.659
Guys, run.

01:19:49.194 --> 01:19:50.062
Go, go!

01:20:00.438 --> 01:20:01.306
Sarah?

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.508
Maggie?

01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:11.816
Maggie, come this way.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:41.346
Rory, stop mucking around.

01:21:16.314 --> 01:21:20.017
I need you to run towards the light.
