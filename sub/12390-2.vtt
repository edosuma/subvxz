GUS! GUS, HERE WE GO!

36:12.500 --> 36:14.536
GUS, IT'S HAPPENING!

36:23.810 --> 36:25.801
I KNOW WHO KILLED
ELVIN CAVANAUGH.

36:27.510 --> 36:29.319
CAN'T HE EVER JUST
TELL US TO ARREST SOMEONE?

36:29.350 --> 36:30.647
HE DOES THIS A LOT?

36:30.680 --> 36:32.341
YES.
YES.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.448
I'M SORRY.

36:33.490 --> 36:35.617
I'M KIND OF A SLAVE
TO MY VISIONS.

36:35.660 --> 36:36.649
I'M A SLAVE.

36:36.690 --> 36:37.918
DO YOU WANT ME TO CUFF HIM?

36:37.960 --> 36:39.825
WHY WOULD I WANT THAT?

36:39.860 --> 36:41.725
JUST A SUGGESTION.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.992
THEY JUST SORT OF COME
WHEN THEY WANT TO COME.

36:46.030 --> 36:47.463
JIRI...

36:50.000 --> 36:51.228
SPELL "SOUBRETTE."

36:52.540 --> 36:54.337
WHY IS THIS MAN SPEAKING?

36:54.380 --> 36:55.631
YOU CAN'T, CAN YOU?

36:55.680 --> 36:58.843
NOT WITHOUT HELP
FROM YOUR DAD,

36:58.880 --> 37:00.700
AND THAT'S NOT
A REAL INHALER,

37:00.750 --> 37:01.978
IS IT?

37:02.020 --> 37:03.248
THIS IS CRAZY.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.339
THIS... THIS...

37:09.290 --> 37:10.882
[SHAWN]: CHEATING....

37:10.920 --> 37:13.480
WAS CAVANAUGH'S OBSESSION.

37:13.530 --> 37:14.394
HE WAS GOING TO EXPOSE YOU

37:14.430 --> 37:15.522
AS A CHEATER.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.788
HE WAS GOING TO
DISQUALIFY JIRI,

37:16.830 --> 37:17.797
AND YOU KNEW IT,

37:17.830 --> 37:19.718
AND YOU COULDN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

37:19.770 --> 37:21.590
YOU HAD WAY TOO MUCH
TO LOSE.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.896
YOU SLIPPED INTO THE BOX.

37:23.940 --> 37:27.467
YOU KNEW HIS COMFORT WAS FOOD.

37:27.510 --> 37:30.536
HE WAS DANGEROUSLY UNHEALTHY.

37:32.310 --> 37:33.379
OH...

37:36.320 --> 37:37.878
HE'S STARTING
TO GO INTO SHOCK...

37:39.520 --> 37:40.782
[GROANS]

37:40.820 --> 37:41.980
YOU KNEW HE WOULDN'T
STOP THE BEE.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.351
HE NEVER STOPS THE BEE.

37:43.390 --> 37:45.688
BY THE END OF THE ROUND,
IT WAS TOO LATE.

37:45.730 --> 37:48.290
HE WAS TOO DIZZY TO WALK.

37:48.330 --> 37:49.957
HE STUMBLES.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.496
HE TUMBLES OVER THE RAIL,

37:57.540 --> 38:02.603
CRASHES TO THE CHAIRS BELOW...

38:02.640 --> 38:05.575
AND THERE GOES THE EVIDENCE...

38:08.550 --> 38:10.313
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

38:12.590 --> 38:13.682
THAT INHALER.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.610
IT SENDS ELECTRONIC SIGNALS.

38:17.660 --> 38:19.855
THE TRANSMITTER
IS IN YOUR JACKET.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.323
YOU SENT THE SIGNALS
FROM THE AUDIENCE

38:21.360 --> 38:22.054
TO THE STAGE,

38:22.100 --> 38:23.055
AND I BET

38:23.100 --> 38:26.797
AT YOUR HOME WE'LL FIND THE VAN

38:26.830 --> 38:30.596
THAT RAN ME OFF THE ROAD
WHEN I ALERTED THE POLICE...

38:32.670 --> 38:35.537
AND A DANGEROUS COCKTAIL
OF UNFORGIVING POISONS.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.502
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

38:37.540 --> 38:39.542
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

38:39.580 --> 38:40.808
I RAN THE CHINESE FOOD
THROUGH THE LAB.

38:40.850 --> 38:42.477
NOTHING'S DEFINITE...

38:42.520 --> 38:43.475
I'M SORRY.

38:43.520 --> 38:44.714
HE JUST SEEMED SURE.

38:44.750 --> 38:45.887
I TOOK A SHOT.

38:50.490 --> 38:53.459
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.907
I COULD'VE WON THAT THING.

39:07.940 --> 39:10.636
YEAH, YOU COULD'VE.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.898
THANK THE LORD YOU DIDN'T.

39:12.950 --> 39:15.373
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

39:15.420 --> 39:17.615
COME ON, GUS.

39:17.650 --> 39:19.982
THE GUY WHO WINS
IS SADDLED FOREVER

39:20.020 --> 39:24.559
AS, YOU KNOW, THE DUDE
THAT WON THE SPELLING BEE.

39:24.590 --> 39:25.955
I'M SURE YOU WOULD HAVE
DEALT WITH IT LATER,

39:25.990 --> 39:27.389
BUT KIDS,

39:27.430 --> 39:28.658
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS
ESPECIALLY,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.019
THEY'RE JUST RUTH LESS. ..

39:30.060 --> 39:31.664
JUDGMENTAL...

39:31.700 --> 39:33.019
HORRIBLE
LITTLE BASTARDS.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.389
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ABLE

39:34.440 --> 39:35.668
TO DATE A CHEERLEADER.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.667
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
INVITED YOU

39:36.700 --> 39:37.598
TO ANY PARTIES.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.937
YOU'D HAVE BEEN
THE OBJECT OF RIDICULE.

39:38.970 --> 39:40.562
I MEAN, THIS WAY,

39:40.610 --> 39:42.077
YOU GOT TO BE A SMART KID
AND A COOL KID,

39:42.110 --> 39:43.600
THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.675
THAT'S TRUE.

39:44.710 --> 39:45.847
I APPRECIATE THAT, SHAWN.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.643
YEAH, IT WAS
A NICE BALANCE.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.978
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO
GIVE YOU THE WRONG LETTER.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.451
YOU KNEW THAT WAS WRONG?

39:54.490 --> 39:55.718
OH, COME ON, GUS.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.785
"AGGIORNAMENTO"?

39:57.820 --> 39:59.583
EVERYBODY KNEW
IT WAS AN "I".

40:01.500 --> 40:02.990
ALL RIGHT, YOU HOLD ON.

40:03.030 --> 40:05.498
YOU WERE HAPPY
ONE SECOND AGO.

40:05.530 --> 40:06.667
I WAS ABOUT TO WIN.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.429
I STUDIED FOR THREE MONTHS.

40:08.470 --> 40:10.563
YEAH, AND YOU WOULD HAVE
KEPT STUDYING FOREVER AND EVER,

40:10.600 --> 40:12.158
ALL THE WAY TILL NATIONALS.

40:15.610 --> 40:16.838
YOU'RE UPSET NOW,
I CAN SEE THAT,

40:16.880 --> 40:17.904
BUT YOU'LL BE
FINE WITH IT LATER.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.009
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DID TO ME?

40:19.050 --> 40:20.449
YES, YES, I DO.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.674
WE WENT OUT THE NEXT NIGHT,

40:23.480 --> 40:24.686
THAT YOU THREW CAUTION
TO THE WIND

40:24.720 --> 40:26.779
AND YOU HOOKED UP
WITH MELINDA CASTLEBERG!

40:26.820 --> 40:27.809
IT WAS NICE!

40:27.850 --> 40:28.919
COME HERE, SHAWN!

40:28.960 --> 40:30.609
AT LEAST
I WAS HONEST!

40:30.660 --> 40:31.854
COME HERE!

40:45.610 --> 40:47.202
AH, SHAWN.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.878
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

40:48.910 --> 40:49.979
YEAH, I WAS JUST
READING THE NEWSPAPER,

40:50.010 --> 40:51.705
A LITTLE ARTICLE
THAT SOUNDED...

40:51.750 --> 40:52.899
VERY FAMILIAR

40:52.950 --> 40:54.144
ABOUT A SPELLING BEE.

40:54.180 --> 40:55.670
THANKS FOR THE HELP, DAD.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.938
POLICE EVER GET THAT EVIDENCE?

40:57.980 --> 41:00.619
A FUNNY LITTLE BIRD
TIPPED THEM OFF.

41:01.990 --> 41:03.014
LEG DOING BETTER?

41:03.060 --> 41:04.118
IT'S GETTING THERE.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.479
DOESN'T HURT SO BAD.

41:09.530 --> 41:10.758
LISTEN, DAD,

41:10.800 --> 41:12.062
THE THING ABOUT THE HOUSE,

41:12.100 --> 41:13.965
THE DOG...

41:14.000 --> 41:15.490
IT WAS KIND OF
A BIG DEAL,

41:15.540 --> 41:16.529
AND I KNOW I HELD
A GRUDGE ABOUT IT

41:16.570 --> 41:18.128
FOR A WHILE, BUT...

41:18.170 --> 41:19.569
I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.834
A DOG NEEDS A HOUSE,

41:21.880 --> 41:25.873
AND A DOGHOUSE
NEEDS AN OCCUPANT, SO...

41:25.910 --> 41:27.571
AS A TOKEN OF MY APPRECIATION,

41:27.610 --> 41:30.044
I LEI-T YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.684
SINCERELY.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.915
THAN KS.

41:36.690 --> 41:38.089
SHAWN?

41:38.120 --> 41:39.257
[LOUDLY]: SHAWN?

41:39.290 --> 41:40.621
NO. NO WAY.

41:40.660 --> 41:42.093
ENJOY, DAD.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.621
SHAWN, YOU GOT TO
TAKE THIS THING WITH YOU.

41:44.670 --> 41:45.489
ARE YOU KIDDING?

41:45.530 --> 41:47.896
THERE'S NO PETS ALLOWED
IN MY APARTMENT.

41:47.930 --> 41:49.636
I'M GOING TO STICK IT
ON THE STREET, SHAWN!

41:49.670 --> 41:51.558
I SWEAR, I'M GOING TO--
SHAWN!

41:51.610 --> 41:52.668
[LAUGHING]

41:52.710 --> 41:54.109
SHAWN!

41:54.140 --> 41:55.573
HE'S NOT GOING TO
KEEP THAT THING.

41:55.610 --> 41:56.929
IT'S MY NEIGHBOR'S DOG.

41:56.980 --> 41:58.709
WE'LL TAKE A LAP
AROUND THE BLOCK.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.900
LET HIM STEW
A LITTLE BIT.

42:00.950 --> 42:02.577
I'M GOING TO STICK IT
ON THE STREET!

42:02.620 --> 42:04.042
SHAWN!

42:04.080 --> 42:05.911
SHAWN!
