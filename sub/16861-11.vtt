00:01.042 --> 00:02.585
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me...

00:02.585 --> 00:03.712
Let me help you.

00:03.712 --> 00:06.006
I can make a better life
for the both of us.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.008
Okay, we could, um...

00:08.008 --> 00:10.885
We could buy a place
on the beach, okay.

00:10.885 --> 00:13.972
Or we can spend the next 30 years
just watching all the kids

00:13.972 --> 00:15.598
grow up and get married,

00:15.598 --> 00:18.768
and their grandkids
play in the ocean and in the sand.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.062
I left him alone for two minutes
with a couple of the guys,

00:21.062 --> 00:23.690
- and he slipped away.
- He said you guys were making fun of him.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.899
That you called him a retard.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.901
Nobody called him a retard.
That's ridiculous.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.778
Look, I'm not saying
that he's a liar, all right.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.823
- He's probably just confused is all.
- I think you should go.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.285
I had an epiphany, Tom.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.829
- I'm turning over a new leaf.
- A new leaf?

00:37.829 --> 00:39.122
I got closure.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.458
Here's my transfer form, Chief.
I want out.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.168
From what I hear, you're already out.

00:44.669 --> 00:48.131
If I hadn't snooped, then I wouldn't have
found out what Damien's been doing.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.507
What's he been doing?

00:50.383 --> 00:51.634
Mmm.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.721
Holy shit. Roofies and Viagra.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.891
You can't let anyone
at my job know about this.

00:58.349 --> 00:59.350
I got it.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.895
First of all,
it's against the rules obviously.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.356
Second of all, I'm an illegal.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.319
You want to get married in
a bar room, or the back of a taxi,

01:09.319 --> 01:14.240
or a friggin' rest stop, that's fine. Just
tell me where, and I'll meet you, okay?

01:14.657 --> 01:15.909
God.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.036
I knew you'd come around.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.998
Janet's pregnant.
It wasn't planned.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.084
Well, it just happened.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.545
I want this.
Whether it's his or yours.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.507
I want this child
to replace what we lost.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.345
We're out, we're out.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.138
There you go, there you go.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.765
Watch it. There you go.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.518
Okay. You're good.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.855
You know, it's a mask, man.
Not a spittoon.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.358
- Jesus.
- Anybody got a rag?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.943
You guys gotta get back up
to five.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.028
Probie and Garrity
were going up to five.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.863
They're gonna need a hand.
Spoke with the super.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.240
Front of the apartment is vacant.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.700
A guy living in the back.
Gonna be tough getting him out.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.285
- Fat guy?
- Just the opposite.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.370
Really?

02:02.163 --> 02:05.250
Hey, guys.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.835
- Hello.
- Garrity!

02:06.835 --> 02:10.046
- Are we in the right place?
- This is where they said, right?

02:12.882 --> 02:13.883
Holy shit.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.761
Hey, guys.
This is amazing, right?

02:16.761 --> 02:17.887
Hey, are you okay, son?

02:17.887 --> 02:19.556
Wait. Give him a second. He can't talk.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.057
He's got the tubie thing
in his throat.

02:21.057 --> 02:24.102
He types the words into the computer
and it reads the words for him

02:24.102 --> 02:25.812
and says the sentences for him.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.313
<i>Get me out of here.</i>

02:29.858 --> 02:32.902
That chair looks kind of heavy.
Give me a hand here, probie.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.487
It's not gonna work, guys.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.156
Oh.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.490
- Gonna take all five of us.
- Shit.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.825
Telling you, it's not gonna work.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.076
- Why?
- Water damage on the stairs

02:40.076 --> 02:41.494
between third and fourth floors.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.164
Plus the weight of this thing,
the whole thing will collapse.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.999
Wait a second.
He's trying to say something.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.835
Will you assholes
stop talking and get me out of here.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.920
How do you usually get...

02:50.920 --> 02:52.672
He's not deaf.
He's just in a wheelchair.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.883
Oh. How do you usually get...

02:55.550 --> 02:56.885
Down the, uh...

02:56.885 --> 02:59.012
Guys, from now on,
probably yes or no answers.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.847
Why don't we take him out
of the wheelchair?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.098
That's what I'm saying.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.892
<i>I'll die. You dumb shit.</i>

03:03.892 --> 03:05.393
Franco, take out the window.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.145
Bring the bucket up.
You two come with me.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.688
Find something we can use
for a ramp.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.774
He can't sleep in that chair,
for Christ's sake.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.235
You all right?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.404
<i>I just shit myself.</i>

03:16.404 --> 03:17.739
Sorry to hear about that.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.868
<i>That's okay.
That's how I always do it.</i>

03:28.374 --> 03:31.419
<i>On another day
C'mon, c'mon</i>

03:31.419 --> 03:34.714
<i>With these ropes I tied
Can we do no wrong?</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:38.051
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

03:38.051 --> 03:41.304
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

03:41.304 --> 03:44.515
<i>With my teeth locked down
I could see the blood</i>

03:44.515 --> 03:47.769
<i>Of a thousand men who have come and gone</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:51.272
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

03:51.272 --> 03:54.108
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

03:54.108 --> 03:57.320
<i>-Is it safe to say?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

03:57.320 --> 04:00.531
<i>-Was it right to leave?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:00.531 --> 04:03.701
<i>- Will I ever learn?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:03.701 --> 04:07.580
<i>C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:12.418 --> 04:14.837
- You're an idiot.
- How? How am I an idiot?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.756
- How are you an idiot?
- Well, ask anyone.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.549
Blueberry pie counts as a fruit.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.635
Okay. Blueberry pie
is not a fruit, okay?

04:20.635 --> 04:23.680
Do you get it off of bushes?
Do you pluck it off trees, huh?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.848
You walk out to the field
and harvest blueberry pie?

04:25.848 --> 04:27.183
- No.
- Oh, but Tom,

04:27.183 --> 04:28.810
what a wonderful world if you could.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.728
Okay, you know what?

04:31.145 --> 04:33.773
What's in blueberry pie?
Blueberries, true or false?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.984
- Yeah, amongst other things.
- Okay. So it's a fruit.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.236
You know what, get in the truck.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.530
Next call, I'm setting you on fire.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.367
Oh, mother of God! Get me off the fence.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.868
Sweet baby Jesus,

04:45.868 --> 04:49.789
who I worship and adore, come and get me
off the fence please, Lord!

04:49.789 --> 04:52.250
Calm down, lady. You moving around
ain't gonna do any good at all.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.418
What's your name, honey?

04:53.418 --> 04:54.877
- Oprah.
- Really?

04:54.877 --> 04:57.046
Hey, how's the book club
going there, Oprah?

04:57.046 --> 05:00.008
Oh, shut your face.
You think there's only one?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.426
Oprah's a common name.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.553
Don't got to tell us.
You're our third one today.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.014
- What do you think, Sawzall?
- Nah, too much vibration.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.683
- Partner saw is the way to go.
- What you talking about a saw?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.393
Ain't nobody sawing nothing here.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.687
Franco grab the partner saw.
Make sure you get the right one.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.272
- Aluminum oxide blade.
- Got it.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.774
Stop talking about a saw.
Come down and help me!

05:16.774 --> 05:18.234
- Now, listen--
- Oh, Jesus.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.069
You're gonna have to
calm down now, okay, hon?

05:20.069 --> 05:21.738
Don't tell me to calm down.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.157
I'm standing here bleeding,
stuck like a pig,

05:24.157 --> 05:25.992
and you're telling me to calm down?

05:26.409 --> 05:29.037
I'll get off this fence,
and I'll take your calm down

05:29.037 --> 05:31.289
and shove it up
your stupid white ass.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.916
Well, that was very un-Oprah like.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.962
Okay, we're gonna cut it here,
down here, same thing on this side.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.131
That'll give the hospital
plenty to work with.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.342
Ain't nobody cutting nothing.
Get away from me, cracker.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.552
- Here we go. The saw's coming.
- Just relax.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.012
Just relax.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.264
Oh! Oh...

05:48.264 --> 05:51.017
Grab her! Grab her!

05:51.017 --> 05:53.561
My God.
It's like Iwo Jima all over again.

05:53.936 --> 05:56.064
- You got her?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.735
What happened?

06:01.736 --> 06:03.279
I burned my eggs.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.323
I was gone, what, 15 minutes?

06:05.323 --> 06:07.241
Huh? You almost burned
the goddamn house down?

06:07.241 --> 06:09.118
Told you I was gonna make
your goddamn eggs.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.787
It was only part of the kitchen.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.081
- Is there a fire there now?
- No.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.000
Well, I put it out.
I'm not completely helpless, y'know?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.713
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to read.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.760
You know what?

06:27.261 --> 06:31.265
We gotta talk.
This ain't working out. Y'know?

06:31.265 --> 06:32.934
What if you hadn't put it out?

06:32.934 --> 06:36.062
What if you had burned the whole
goddamn building down? Huh?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.314
Huh? What then?

06:38.314 --> 06:41.359
What if you fall down? And I'm not here,
Sheila's not here, Lou's not here.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.570
I mean, we got to start thinking
of other options, okay?

06:46.280 --> 06:47.990
Now you hear this, boy-o.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.700
Because I'm only saying it once.

06:49.700 --> 06:55.039
You talk about putting me
in some goddamn home ever again

06:55.039 --> 06:57.458
and the next fire I start...

06:58.709 --> 07:02.922
Will take out me, this whole apartment
and quite possibly you, too.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.298
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.634
Thirty-seven years on the job.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.138
And you don't think I can't do it.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.475
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, you know.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.519
You want to go grab
like a brew or something?

07:16.519 --> 07:18.062
Uh, well, Maggie's coming over.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.648
We were gonna take a walk.
Get a bite to eat. You wanna come?

07:20.648 --> 07:23.151
No. That's cool. I mean, you guys
don't want me hanging around.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.735
Besides, I like Maggie and everything,

07:24.735 --> 07:26.320
but she makes me
kind of, like, nervous.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.655
Really, nervous, how?

07:27.655 --> 07:30.324
Like if she looks at me
too long, I might cry.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.951
Yeah. I get that, too.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.579
Except for me,
it's a little more hot than it is scary.

07:34.579 --> 07:39.375
Hey, uh, guys. I need a little input here.
This is gonna sound kind of strange,

07:39.375 --> 07:41.878
but I think I'm getting submarined
by a retard.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.504
One of you guys buy a sub?

07:43.504 --> 07:45.590
No, no, no. I'm not talking about them.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.467
I'm talking about
Natalie's brother. Richie.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.552
Hey, but how neat
would it be to have your own sub?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.846
Yeah, totally, dude.
That would be sick.

07:51.846 --> 07:56.476
I know that he's retarded, but I swear
he's playing me, Lou, you know?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.604
I mean, sometimes I catch him
with this smile on his face, y'know.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.272
It's kind of like
he's trying to sabotage

08:01.272 --> 08:02.815
what I got going on with his sister.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.108
- I buy it.
- Yeah?

08:04.108 --> 08:06.194
Oh, yeah. They're crafty people,
the retards.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.321
I mean, case in point,
the special Olympics.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.240
They call their Olympics special.
What does that make our Olympics?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.534
Not special.
Ordinary. Run of the mill.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.454
And what about their needs?
Now, they're special, too.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.415
What about my needs?
Hey, I know my needs, gentlemen.

08:19.415 --> 08:23.127
And a couple of them are pretty
goddamn special. Not to mention perverse.

08:23.127 --> 08:26.714
- Yeah, so what's his game?
- Well, it's pretty obvious.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.342
- Oh, this will be good.
- He probably feels threatened.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.719
Y'know, I mean, he sees you
and his sister getting close,

08:31.719 --> 08:34.222
and he's afraid that he might
lose her to you.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.808
Y'know, and who's to say he'd be along
for the ride if that happened?

08:37.808 --> 08:42.939
He's scared. Frightened. I'd be worried
about the same thing if I were him.

08:45.274 --> 08:49.111
Holy shit, Mikey,
I think you might, uh, I hate to say it,

08:49.111 --> 08:51.239
be absolutely goddamn right there. Lou?

08:51.239 --> 08:53.449
What can I say, he speaks retard,
we don't.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.534
Hmm.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.329
We gotta find a place
to eat. I'm starving.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.873
All I had was a pop tart
and two olives all day.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.209
Oh, that's a good diet.
It's healthy.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.003
Hey, this is nice though, right,
just walking out in the fresh air?

09:06.003 --> 09:07.672
Doing a little window shopping?

09:07.672 --> 09:10.633
My mom and dad they used to do this
when they were courting.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.134
They'd just walk
and window shop.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.970
- Did you just say "courting"?
- Yeah.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.305
Christ, what is this,
<i>Little House on the</i> goddamn <i>Prairie?</i>

09:16.305 --> 09:18.266
Hello, that's what
they used to do back then.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.393
- Yeah, and they got diphtheria.
- And they courted.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.979
Oh, Jesus look.
Wow, that's gonna be me someday soon.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.022
You're gonna get a job
as a mannequin?

09:25.773 --> 09:28.442
You're not marrying me
in a monkey suit, Sean. No way.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.611
I'm starting to feel we're not
on the same page.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.655
No, I don't think
we're in the same book.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.449
Okay, well, look.
I'll do it however you want, okay?

09:35.449 --> 09:37.994
What's important to me
is that we are just standing there,

09:37.994 --> 09:39.954
taking our vows
in the eyes of God. All right?

09:39.954 --> 09:41.247
Where in the eyes of God?

09:41.247 --> 09:44.250
What do you think, Maggie,
in a church, all right, in his house.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.626
Can't he come to our house?

09:45.626 --> 09:47.712
Maggie, please, will you do this
for me and for my folks?

09:47.712 --> 09:50.506
I'm no good in churches,
Sean, they creep me out.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.384
All those statues
looking down at me, judging,

09:53.384 --> 09:56.554
knowing all the dirty,
promiscuous, unprotected sex I've had.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.598
Whoa, whoa, okay.
You know what, that's a lot,

09:58.598 --> 10:00.600
but why don't you,
just how much unprotected--

10:00.600 --> 10:02.018
Don't ask, and definitely,

10:02.018 --> 10:04.312
we're not getting married in the church,
I can't do it.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.315
it's not just about my folks, Maggie.
It's about me, too, you know.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.025
I mean, the world
that we live in

10:09.025 --> 10:11.277
and the job that I had
and how we are together.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.695
Listen to me...

10:13.487 --> 10:16.407
I love you, okay?
I love you in letters eight miles high.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.702
But you, you gotta do this for me.
I'm telling you, it's a deal breaker.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.705
Okay, fine.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.790
So we'll get hitched
in the church. Big deal.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.126
All right, I'll call the priest.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.671
Mmm-mmm. Holy cats.

10:31.672 --> 10:35.217
A terrific meal,
prepared by a beautiful woman.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.762
I may as well
just take a gun to my head.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.181
'Cause it does not get
any better than this.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.935
That's a terrible thing to say.

10:44.935 --> 10:48.939
Besides, we are just
getting to the best part of the evening.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.776
Aren't we? Jerry?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.277
The best part?

10:56.447 --> 10:58.616
Look, Karlene...

10:58.783 --> 11:01.202
Look, you're a terrific woman, y'know?

11:01.452 --> 11:03.245
But I just, I need a little, uh...

11:04.121 --> 11:06.082
I don't know if I'm ready for this yet.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.042
You look more than ready.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.380
Well, I am, I am,
b-b-but not tonight.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.174
I know you're gonna think I'm crazy, uh,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.218
and I'm sure I'm gonna be
kicking myself in the ass

11:17.218 --> 11:18.886
as soon as you walk
out that door, but...

11:19.845 --> 11:22.348
I need to just take some time here.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.767
I'll be ready for you soon.

11:25.935 --> 11:29.105
You know, for a man
looks like a garden gnome,

11:29.689 --> 11:32.024
you got a lot of demands.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.360
I suppose I better leave now.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.238
So you can start kicking yourself.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.574
I'll be waiting.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.892
- Oh. Uh...
- Hey.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.102
Sorry.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.188
I'm, uh, a friend of Lou's.
I'll just, I'll be a minute.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.773
- Okay.
- Thanks.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.823
Hey.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.701
- Nice.
- Yeah, she's cute, huh?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.119
Yeah. How was she?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.747
Oh, come on now.
Nice guys don't tell.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.583
Get out of here, punk.
You're ruining my afterglow.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.792
All right. Good night.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.555
Sorry, about that.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.933
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.772
Okay, okay.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.024
- See you.
- Bye.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.701
Get out of the bed, whore.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.869
- What it it?
- Get up.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.704
- What's the matter?
- Tell me I didn't witness

13:08.704 --> 13:11.040
- what I think I just witnessed.
- What did you witness?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.542
She's not really a nun, right?
She's wearing a nun costume,

13:13.542 --> 13:16.712
like her French maid costume was at
the dry cleaners or something?

13:19.256 --> 13:22.092
Okay... um...

13:22.092 --> 13:25.679
Your confusion is expected
as was this conversation.

13:25.679 --> 13:29.016
What the mind sees
is sometimes not that which is real,

13:29.016 --> 13:31.477
but rather the reality
which is brought to it.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.437
- Really?
- I'm brushing up on Buddhism.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.606
The Buddhist approach to
thought and deed.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.233
Ask yourself this, Tom.

13:37.691 --> 13:41.654
If a tree falls in a forest, and there's
no one there to see it or hear it,

13:41.654 --> 13:43.572
would you still be such an asshole?

13:44.156 --> 13:47.993
Actually, you might have done me a favor
there by discarding one of my possessions.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.662
That's part of the path
to enlightenment.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.832
Okay, my foot is about to take
the enlightened path up your ass.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.959
Is she a nun, or is she not a nun?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.670
She's a semi-nun.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.673
She's a semi-nun.
What does that mean?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.716
She's in the nun National Guard? Huh?

14:02.716 --> 14:05.261
She's the bride of Christ
one weekend a month,

14:05.261 --> 14:08.806
- what the hell does that mean?
- Why don't you sit down and calm yourself.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.808
And I'll make us some green tea
and we will talk.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.476
I'm not sitting with you
and doing anything.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.271
- You have crossed a boundary, my friend.
- You have boundaries?

14:15.271 --> 14:18.023
I have one boundary, Lou.
One boundary and one boundary only.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.359
No sex with nuns
in the place where I live.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.820
Her name is Theresa Azzurro.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.448
- Theresa Azzurro.
- I am not-- Na na na na.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.504
I met her at the market last week.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.465
Jeans, t-shirt, leather boots.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.759
The body, you just got a glimpse of.

14:45.759 --> 14:49.388
We talk. I tell her what I do.
She tells me she's a nun.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.892
She's a nun until the end
of the month, okay?

14:52.892 --> 14:56.186
She's leaving the order.
They know all about it.

14:56.186 --> 14:59.189
She's trying to spend
a few days every week

14:59.189 --> 15:01.775
outside of the convent
trying to adjust.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.319
Adjust what, her vagina?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.738
For a couple more weeks,
she's living under their roof.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.407
She has to abide by their rules,
and then she's out.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.535
This could be really big
for me, Tom.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.872
I'm sure it is. It's a nun.
What's bigger than a nun? A saint?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.958
Oh, you know, Tom.
I mean, you know, I got a chance here.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.878
She's only been with two guys.
One was some clown back in high school,

15:20.878 --> 15:23.422
and the other is, you know, Jesus.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.258
Yeah, Jesus. Our Lord and Savior
who died for our sins.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.218
- That Jesus, right?
- Yeah, word on the street is,

15:28.218 --> 15:30.095
I was created in his image, y'know.

15:30.095 --> 15:34.308
And there are those people
who say I, too, move in mysterious ways.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.352
Uh-huh, she's technically
still married to him.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.562
That means she's cheating
on the Son of God with you.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.230
I got a hundred pounds
on the guy, look,

15:40.230 --> 15:42.566
no holes in my hands.
Bring it on, Jesus.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.526
Okay, you just crossed
the second boundary.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.819
Get away from me.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.655
- What?
- Man, I need to lie down.

15:47.821 --> 15:48.948
- You all right?
- Ah!

15:50.741 --> 15:52.326
- What's that smell?
- What smell?

15:52.326 --> 15:55.162
It's either the kitchen,
or I think you might have

15:55.162 --> 15:57.331
actually burned a hole in my soul.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.707
Oh, yeah, that's it.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.379
Oh, yeah.
Right through the middle of the soul.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.050
- Yeah.
- <i>Hi, it's me.</i>

16:08.050 --> 16:09.510
<i>Are you almost done with your shift?</i>

16:09.510 --> 16:11.512
Well, I got stuck on a call.
Why, what's up?

16:11.512 --> 16:14.807
He's gone. I said that I was gonna
come back here and check up on him,

16:14.807 --> 16:17.685
- make him dinner, and he just took off.
- Who, Damien?

16:17.851 --> 16:20.646
No, not Damien. Your dad.
He's gone.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.856
Well, where could he go?
He's 83 years old.

16:22.856 --> 16:25.150
It takes him 20 minutes
to walk to the toilet. From the tub.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.402
He left you a note.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.070
What's it say?

16:28.070 --> 16:29.571
Did you try and burn down the kitchen?

16:29.571 --> 16:31.240
What? That's what the note says?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.408
No. I'm just asking you.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.034
Read the note.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.746
It's just the same old shit. It says he's
ashamed of you, you're a terrible son,

16:37.746 --> 16:39.540
that you couldn't give him a male heir,

16:39.540 --> 16:41.625
- blah blah blah.
- That's all it says?

16:41.625 --> 16:43.669
No, he also said that
he was gonna kill himself.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.046
- Whose rosary beads are these?
- <i>What?</i>

16:46.046 --> 16:49.008
I found these rosary beads
behind the door in the bathroom.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.969
- Whose are they?
- Um... those are Lou's.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.264
Lou's a catholic?
I didn't know he was into that.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.058
He got into it the other night.
What else does the note say?

16:58.058 --> 16:59.893
Say where he's gonna kill himself? When?

16:59.893 --> 17:02.646
No. Of course not.

17:03.605 --> 17:04.690
Old people.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.525
They've got to be so mysterious.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.819
Look, you better start
going out and trying to find him,

17:08.819 --> 17:11.071
and I'll just stick around here
and see if he shows up, okay?

17:11.071 --> 17:13.490
All right. Thanks. Aah!

17:14.825 --> 17:16.618
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.162
You got problems, pal.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.997
Nah, it's just an ingrown nail.

17:20.330 --> 17:24.293
I'm serious. People around here
feel like you're getting a free ride.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.755
Y'know, 'cause you're already
somewhat of a hero around here

17:27.755 --> 17:29.173
based on what you did.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.258
Now you're getting free sex.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.260
We gotta make it look good.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.428
How?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.138
You gotta get a job.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.349
Shit! A job and a wife.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.852
It's getting to be
just like on the outside.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.604
What can I tell you, life sucks.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.231
Even when you might be doing life.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.818
- That's funny.
- That ain't funny.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.320
It's funny.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.033
Y'know, I appreciate
you coming with me

17:56.033 --> 17:59.203
because I know it's probably speed dating
night at the convent or something.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.039
That's very, very, very comical.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.124
- Mmm-hmm.
- Wait a minute. Is that him?

18:04.124 --> 18:06.168
That's an old lady, for Christ's sake.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.045
God, that is one ugly old lady.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.717
Hey, I was thinking about the three of us,
y'know, having dinner.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.427
- The three of us?
- Yeah.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.805
Hope you're talking about the old lady
and us 'cause

18:17.805 --> 18:19.681
I know you're not talking to me
about the nun

18:19.681 --> 18:21.016
because you've already gotten me

18:21.016 --> 18:23.685
so many minus points
on the get to heaven roster.

18:23.685 --> 18:27.106
No, I am talking about the nun, Tom,
all right. Her name is Teresa, okay.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.649
And she happens to be
an amazing woman.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.900
She happen to be very smart.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.944
- She happens to be very brave, too. Yeah.
- A brave nun?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.196
- Oh, that's great.
- I mean, making that kind of a life change

18:34.196 --> 18:36.198
after what she's been through, y'know.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.200
She's got me thinking about,
you know, my own changes.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.743
The whole fishing boat thing.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.371
- Again with the boat?
- Again with the boat.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.747
My cousin just called me.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.374
He's bringing it up
from Florida next week.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.834
Going out to Montauk, meeting him.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.169
He's gonna take me out for the day,
show me the ropes.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.839
Sun in my face, wind in my hair.
It's gonna be nice.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.757
You want the boat?
Get on and try the boat.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.759
I hope you like the boat.
Stop talking about it.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.719
Boat this, boat this.
The boat, the boat, the boat.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.514
- I'm sick of the god damn boat.
- Okay.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.725
You're supposed to be helping me
look for my old man, okay?

19:03.725 --> 19:05.727
Let's, let's go over to McPhee's.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.813
He used to drink there.
Let's see if he went back.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.482
McPhee's is gone, Tom.
It's a Korean nail salon now.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.401
- You're shitting me.
- No, I'm not shitting you.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.361
I mean, those places
are like ragweed.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.239
Christ. You go to the movies,
you get up to go take a piss,

19:17.239 --> 19:19.992
- you come back, Korean nail salon.
- Yeah.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.952
Yeah, let's go over the list
one more time, okay?

19:21.952 --> 19:23.287
- Yeah.
- Piper's Den.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.454
Nail salon.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.748
- Uh, Molly Noonan's.
- It's too far.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.917
- Irish Mahoney's.
- Too crowded.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.129
- Uh, Scratcher?
- It's all Black now.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.089
- The Corkscrew.
- Gay bar.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.675
- Okay, what about the Galway Gael?
- Gay nail salon.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.552
Jeez, they've got their own
nail salons now.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.845
They do very well.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.225
Y'know, Tom,
I've got to be honest with you.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.895
- Yeah.
- Part of me, y'know, is kind of glad

19:47.895 --> 19:50.856
my parents passed, when they did.

19:51.773 --> 19:55.235
Saves me from having to watch them
grow old, y'know, fall apart.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.824
I'm a selfish prick, aren't I?

20:01.658 --> 20:03.035
I know where he is.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.247
<i>But the sea is wide</i>

20:07.414 --> 20:10.751
<i>And I can't cross over</i>

20:11.084 --> 20:16.798
<i>And have our wings to fly</i>

20:17.716 --> 20:19.760
<i>Build me a boat...</i>

20:28.644 --> 20:30.437
Build me a boat.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.607
What the hell am I gonna do
with a goddamn boat?

20:36.068 --> 20:40.072
Teary-eyed, pissant song.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.740
I hate it.

20:43.909 --> 20:44.993
But she loved it.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.915
Well, Martha. Here we are.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.793
Should be the other way around, huh?

20:52.793 --> 20:54.002
Hey.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.089
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.590
Say hello to your mother.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.594
- Say hello to your mother!
- Okay.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.847
Hey, ma.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.310
She never liked that being said to her.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.605
Yeah, she said
it sounded like sheep.

21:14.898 --> 21:15.899
Hmm.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.444
She was the best woman I ever knew.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.991
And the best years of my life
were spent with her.

21:25.325 --> 21:28.537
What are you talking about? The two of you
fought like two wet cats in a bag.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.416
Well, the day to day was rough, I admit.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.419
But, the years...

21:36.628 --> 21:37.921
Were wonderful.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.590
- Come on.
- Don't patronize me.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.176
- I'm not patronizing.
- I know why you want me out.

21:43.176 --> 21:47.597
I know why you want to put me
in some home.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.267
I never said I was gonna--

21:50.267 --> 21:54.187
It's not because I'm some
old, ancient bastard.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.356
It's because...

21:57.357 --> 21:59.651
This is what's waiting for you.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.737
This is your future.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.365
Y'know, you were a bright lad.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.492
Maybe not bright, but popular.

22:08.744 --> 22:12.039
I thought you were gonna
kick life's ass.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.499
Now, look at you now.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.628
You got nothing.
There's not that much time, Tommy.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.091
God, so little time.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.803
You know...

22:28.263 --> 22:29.931
This is what you're gonna be.

22:31.266 --> 22:32.976
Drunk in some graveyard.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.062
Crying like an old lady.

22:37.397 --> 22:38.398
Come on.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.318
Let's go home. I'm not gonna...

22:41.777 --> 22:43.737
- No, no, no.
- Put you in a nursing home.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.365
I-- I-- We'll figure something else out.
All right?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.784
Leave these, leave these.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.410
Those were her favorites.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.580
She may want to listen.

22:56.583 --> 22:57.709
Come on.

23:00.337 --> 23:04.508
Put that down. Let's go. Come on.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.762
Y'know, you're always touching me.
Now cut it out.

23:08.762 --> 23:11.723
- I'm trying to help you.
- Ah, I don't need your help.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.101
Careful. Don't let me fall.
Hold on to me.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.394
Want me to touch you or not?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.729
I'll tell you when
and when not to touch me.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.398
Now get your hands off me.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.191
Come here.
Hold on to me, for Christ's sake.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.567
Jesus Christ.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.612
I want my sundae.

23:25.904 --> 23:30.909
Yeah, yeah. It's on its way,
Rich. So, uh...

23:30.909 --> 23:33.412
I, uh, I thought we should
get together, y'know,

23:33.412 --> 23:35.789
the two of us and talk over some stuff.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.125
Like what?

23:39.126 --> 23:42.421
Well, uh, like how I think
your sister's real great.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.339
And I care about her.

23:44.798 --> 23:48.760
And I wouldn't want anything
or anyone to mess up what we got going.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.221
I want my sundae.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.932
Yeah. They're making it,
all right, Richie?

23:53.932 --> 23:55.851
- Promise.
- Nigga.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.188
Uh, he didn't mean anything by that, sir.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.190
He's got a little
Tourette's thing, that's all.

24:02.190 --> 24:06.236
Yeah, I got a Tourette's thing, too.
I keep it loaded in my glove compartment.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.363
Uh, sorry.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.242
Look, Richard. I know
what you're doing, okay?

24:12.242 --> 24:14.661
You're playing a game.
Now look, I don't blame you.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.621
It's worked before,
why shouldn't it work now?

24:16.621 --> 24:19.166
Your sister gets serious about some guy,

24:19.166 --> 24:21.251
you see the balance of power
starting to shift.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.880
You kick the retard thing into high gear,
and the guy in question beats feet.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.715
Well, look, you can cut
that shit right now.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.384
Because you and me,
this ain't about power, Richie.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.970
It's about both of us
loving Natalie, all right?

24:31.970 --> 24:35.891
It's about both of us being man enough
to share her without, y'know,

24:35.891 --> 24:37.601
acting like a couple of retards.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.897
I think we got some stuff in common.

24:42.522 --> 24:43.690
Like what?

24:44.858 --> 24:46.902
We're both smarter than we look.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.654
Yeah, well, maybe.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.575
So, uh, if it's okay,

24:53.575 --> 24:57.787
I wanted to ask your permission
to continue seeing your sister.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.123
Y'know, because, I really dig her,
Richard, I do.

25:00.123 --> 25:03.210
And I want to spend more time with her.
And you.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.547
Nobody ever asked me
for my permission before.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.634
For anything.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.721
So you gonna pull back
on the retard shit?

25:14.721 --> 25:16.890
- Deal.
- All right. My man.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.308
Enjoy.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.185
- There you go.
- I asked for nuts.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.937
Could we get some nuts here, please?

25:21.937 --> 25:25.148
My brother asked for nuts.
Could we get some goddamn nuts over her?

25:25.148 --> 25:28.568
You're crazy.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.281
Maggie, hey, don't. Don't do that.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.701
What? I'm having a nicotine fit.
I walk inside any holy building

25:36.701 --> 25:38.912
and my body chemistry goes
completely ape shit.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.372
Don't swear in here.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.124
Ape shit is not a swear word.
It's a zoological term.

25:43.124 --> 25:46.294
Good evening.
Hi. I'm Father Daniel Chaffe.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.754
Call me Father Dan.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.256
Hope I haven't kept you waiting long.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.508
- No, no. Not at all, sir.
- Yeah, 20 minutes.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.009
But, like, who's counting?

25:53.009 --> 25:56.763
Okay, so, Sean and Maggie.

25:57.305 --> 26:00.684
Congratulations on undertaking
the holy sacrament of marriage.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.270
Let's be sure we got
all your information.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.314
- I assume your given name is Margaret?
- Oh, Gavin.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.859
- What?
- You said, "given name", it's Gavin.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.362
I was asking about
her name at birth.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.239
Oh, right, sorry. Just trying to help.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.825
- Is it Margaret?
- Uh, no.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.411
- Uh, then what is it?
- It's none of your beeswax.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.996
Maggie, hello, could you...

26:20.996 --> 26:22.872
Okay, fine. Can't he look it up?

26:23.415 --> 26:24.833
- I'm sorry.
- Peggy Sue.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.418
What? Peggy Sue?

26:26.418 --> 26:29.546
- Your father was a Buddy Holly fan?
- Did he name me Buddy?

26:31.423 --> 26:34.551
Is this a first marriage in
the church for both of you?

26:34.551 --> 26:37.012
- For me, yes, it is.
- And it is for me, too,

26:37.012 --> 26:39.598
well, not counting the three stinkers
I have under my belt,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.308
but they weren't in the church.

26:41.308 --> 26:44.603
First time, I got married by a monk.
Second time by a priestess,

26:44.603 --> 26:48.315
and third time by some guy in a cape
on a beach and one of us was naked.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.191
- Can I smoke in here?
- Maggie, don't, Maggie.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.693
He works around
burning incense all day.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.987
What's a little bit
more smoke gonna do to him, right, Sean?

26:53.987 --> 26:55.280
Right, Danny?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.698
Ah-ah. There's no smoking in here.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.576
- Fine. Got it.
- Or anywhere else in the building.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.580
He's probably gonna smoke that
when we leave.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.708
Okay. Could you cut it out, please?
Jesus. Sorry.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.336
The two of you haven't come here
on a dare, have you?

27:09.336 --> 27:12.047
No, no. Seriously, Father.
Please forgive my fiancée.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.215
She's having some issues
with the church.

27:14.215 --> 27:17.385
And, um, we're working them out.
In counseling.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.723
Uh, yes, marriage, catholic
issue counseling.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.016
- It's really very helpful.
- I see.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.893
And where are you
receiving this counseling?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.561
Murphy's pub on 48th.

27:26.561 --> 27:28.938
- Maggie, could you--
- I think we're done here.

27:28.938 --> 27:33.151
Should you actually find a church
that's willing to marry you,

27:33.151 --> 27:34.986
I want to wish you both
the best of luck.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.739
How dare you walk out on us,
you sanctimonious tool?

27:37.739 --> 27:40.367
You have no idea
how important this is to him.

27:41.201 --> 27:46.206
I assisted during an exorcism in
a small village outside Nairobi in 1977.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.291
Or did we meet somewhere else?

27:50.377 --> 27:53.338
Five bucks says we made
the front page of the bulletin.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.216
- Jeez.
- Hey, Tom.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.010
- Hey, Chief. Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, no, that's all right.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.262
I wanted to catch you
before you went into the back.

28:01.262 --> 28:03.014
It's kind of on a personal matter, y'know.

28:03.014 --> 28:06.267
- What?
- Well, I, uh, I don't know where to start.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.228
I started seeing this woman,
and we hit it off.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.480
- Right.
- And she wanted to have

28:10.480 --> 28:12.732
some fun the other night,
and I had to back off, y'know.

28:12.732 --> 28:15.110
Why? I thought,
didn't you and Rose kind of...

28:15.110 --> 28:17.779
- Yeah, that's different, y'know.
- Different how?

28:18.196 --> 28:20.740
Well, Rose is almost my age,
and she's white,

28:20.740 --> 28:25.328
and this girl is black, and near 40,
and she's hot and big,

28:25.328 --> 28:28.415
and I mean, I like it, but, uh,
I'm a little scared, y'know.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.582
Scared.

28:30.041 --> 28:33.253
Yeah, I mean, like, y'know,
tapping Mary Tyler Moore's one thing,

28:33.253 --> 28:34.963
but Eartha Kitt's
another whole story, y'know.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.756
Jesus, Mary Tyler Moore
and Eartha Kitt.

28:36.756 --> 28:40.510
I'd need a blindfold, four Viagra
and a strap on to do either one of them.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.637
I'll check into it.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.931
- Okay. Sooner the better. Thanks.
- All right.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.060
Okay, fellas. I think
I can take it from there.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.604
Hey, am I glad to see you, baby.

28:51.604 --> 28:53.606
Y'know, they want me to work now?

28:53.606 --> 28:57.026
I gotta take a god damn job.
Can you believe this shit?

28:57.652 --> 29:03.116
Ah. Hey, I've been behaving like
a choir boy. I've been cleaning my cell.

29:03.491 --> 29:04.826
Been nice to the guards.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.536
I even brokered a peace pact

29:06.536 --> 29:10.457
between the gay Aryan alliance
and the goddamn straight Aryan alliance.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.668
I mean, that alone
took me two goddamn weeks.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.545
I'm like Kissinger in here.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.796
Huh...

29:18.590 --> 29:19.591
Baby?

29:21.551 --> 29:22.552
Sweetheart?

29:23.595 --> 29:24.596
What?

29:24.596 --> 29:28.183
Y'know, how come you never
ask me about my day?

29:30.435 --> 29:34.314
Well, I mean, if we--
if, potential house,

29:34.314 --> 29:36.983
this one here is pretty cool.
I mean, a tiki bar?

29:36.983 --> 29:39.068
That's enough to make me
start drinking again.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.946
So that would be my number one pick.
And number two, I'd...

29:41.946 --> 29:46.451
Have to-- Great. Number two,
and number three.

29:46.451 --> 29:50.747
Well, I mean-- Oh, y'know what,
let's just take these three

29:50.747 --> 29:54.083
and put them into
a big what if stack, okay?

29:54.083 --> 29:55.168
Gosh.

29:56.002 --> 29:59.923
- What?
- Um, we totally picked the same order.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.469
- You're shitting me, really? All three?
- Mmm-hmm.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.724
Well, I mean, Jimmy and I always
did kind of have

30:09.724 --> 30:13.436
the same taste in almost everything.
Cars, clothes...

30:15.897 --> 30:16.898
Um...

30:17.607 --> 30:20.944
So anyway, what did you
want to ask me?

30:20.944 --> 30:22.654
Um, right.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.864
All right. Yeah.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.826
- This is gonna sound a little strange.
- What?

30:27.826 --> 30:29.536
And you're gonna want to
scream your head off.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.913
- What?
- But please resist.

30:31.913 --> 30:34.999
- What?
- The urge to, stop saying "what", okay?

30:36.292 --> 30:40.797
I might need you to rummage
around in Damien's room

30:40.797 --> 30:43.800
and find one or two
tablets of Viagra.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.719
- Hmm?
- Viagra. I need some Viagra.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.266
- Okay. Okay. Okay!
- It's not for me. I'm serious.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.477
For the Chief. He's got a new girlfriend.
He's afraid about performing.

30:54.477 --> 30:57.146
- Okay.
- Just stop saying okay.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.898
I have things to say.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.401
It's not for me. Okay, I'm not sleeping
with anyone else,

31:01.401 --> 31:04.404
or you right now, okay.
So it's really for the chief, okay.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.114
It's for him, okay?
You've got me saying it.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.866
You know what...

31:07.866 --> 31:11.035
Just call me later,
and if I happen to find some,

31:11.035 --> 31:13.872
then you can just
come by after work and pick it up. Okay?

31:13.872 --> 31:14.998
Ow! Okay.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.499
Sexiest girl in the world.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.004
Y'know, she could save your life.
What's left of it.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.088
Yep.

31:22.505 --> 31:25.133
Hey, stopped by my uncle
Red's house before I got to work today.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.259
- Mmm-hmm.
- Get up there

31:26.259 --> 31:28.261
and hear moaning and groaning
coming from inside.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.554
Ah, ah, I don't want to hear it.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.807
No, I let myself in, I found him lying
naked in the bottom of the tub.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.101
Better than what I thought
you were going to tell me.

31:35.101 --> 31:38.354
Should've seen him.
One long, ugly wrinkle with four teeth.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.315
- Mmm-hmm.
- He slipped in the shower last night.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.151
Spends the whole night flat on his back
in the bottom of the tub.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.903
Got an imprint of the drain on his scalp.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.154
- What that's payback for?
- What?

31:46.154 --> 31:47.989
- Your little nun thing.
- Oh, yeah, anyway.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.782
He had a date last night, 78 years old,

31:49.782 --> 31:52.160
Came home, decided he wanted
to wash the stank off him.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.454
- His words not mine.
- How much did he pay for the date?

31:54.454 --> 31:55.747
Thirty five bucks.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.457
That was a rhetorical question.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.710
Anyway, I'm yanking his skinny little
Irish ass out of the tub this morning,

32:00.710 --> 32:03.796
and I'm suddenly struck
by the image of killing two birds,

32:03.796 --> 32:06.132
two very old birds, with one stone.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.135
Uh, no.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.012
- Why not? Why not?
- No. Forget it.

32:11.012 --> 32:14.015
- You-- No.
- Tommy, Tommy. My uncle and your father.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.725
We move them in together. Okay?

32:15.725 --> 32:19.103
They can keep their one good eye
on each other, we don't have to worry.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.355
I mean, what's gonna happen?

32:20.355 --> 32:21.773
They gonna die at the exact moment?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.066
I mean, I wouldn't bet on that.

32:23.066 --> 32:26.486
Are you insane? Are you completely,
completely out of your mind?

32:26.486 --> 32:27.612
- You know what this is?
- Hmm?

32:27.612 --> 32:29.030
- Stephen King's next novel?
- Really?

32:29.030 --> 32:30.949
Between the drinking, fighting,
the black rage,

32:30.949 --> 32:32.408
you're creating a sick evil vortex

32:32.408 --> 32:34.494
which could wipe out
most of the eastern seaboard.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.246
You want to know something?
I ran it by my uncle, he's onboard.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.791
It's amazing what lying 10 hours
naked on the bottom of a tub

32:39.791 --> 32:43.002
will do to some people. And we called
your father, he said, no problem.

32:43.002 --> 32:44.796
Uncle Red's tidying up
the joint right now,

32:44.796 --> 32:46.839
says we can move your dad in tonight.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.093
What do you think?

32:51.260 --> 32:52.261
It's on your head.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.722
Hey, look, what are you worried about?
Okay, besides the vortex

32:54.722 --> 32:57.433
and the subsequent millions
of innocent lives lost,

32:57.433 --> 32:58.726
I don't see the downside.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.144
Eh.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.980
- You should be thanking me.
- Uh-huh.

33:02.313 --> 33:08.236
Now, if it's a boy, okay,
what about, Roman?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.446
- Roman?
- Yeah.

33:10.446 --> 33:13.199
- As in Polanski?
- No, like in Gabriel.

33:13.199 --> 33:15.702
Oh, Gabriel. I like that.
I like Gabriel.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.871
- You do?
- Yeah, it's strong, but it's sexy.

33:18.871 --> 33:20.957
Yes. Yes, it is.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.292
Okay, but, just bear with me. Just--

33:25.420 --> 33:28.506
- I got it. All right, you ready for this?
- Uh-huh.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.802
Namath Gavin. Huh?
How cool is that?

33:32.802 --> 33:37.306
- Namath? Uh-huh.
- Yeah, it's sexy, it's strong.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.100
Honey, let me ask you something,

33:39.100 --> 33:43.187
is that whole list just a list of names
of past and present NFL quarterbacks?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.648
- Well, yeah. But...
- Yeah.

33:45.648 --> 33:49.527
And that's where you came up
with the idea of Namath Gavin?

33:49.527 --> 33:53.281
Well, actually, I was thinking more along
the lines of Joe Montana, but then,

33:53.281 --> 33:56.075
you kind of latched on to the whole
Roman Gabriel last name angle,

33:56.075 --> 33:58.494
so I called an audible, right,
I scrambled.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.288
- Nice.
- But I truly believe

34:00.288 --> 34:05.460
that Namath Gavin is an original,
great name. Huh?

34:06.377 --> 34:08.588
- No?
- Go to work.

34:08.588 --> 34:13.634
Yeah. Just think about Namath.
It's sexy and it's strong.

34:13.634 --> 34:16.471
And do me a favor and think
about a new list.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.980
- Pension?
- Oh! What the hell?

34:25.980 --> 34:27.982
Crunching some
numbers, huh?

34:27.982 --> 34:29.901
- Thinking about getting out?
- No.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.988
Just, y'know, you've been
talking about, y'know,

34:33.988 --> 34:36.032
your pension and retirement,
blah blah blah.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.241
I just thought, you know what,

34:37.241 --> 34:40.953
I never really sat down and thought
based on my overtime, y'know.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.747
This year, and my salary,

34:42.747 --> 34:45.458
I mean, what would I leave with
if I wanted to leave,

34:45.458 --> 34:47.085
not that I'm thinking of leaving.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.129
And yeah, it's not as bad
as I thought it would be.

34:50.129 --> 34:53.257
I mean, it would be tight
with Janet and the divorce

34:53.257 --> 34:56.135
- and the kids and everything, but...
- But it's tempting, right?

34:56.135 --> 34:57.637
Hey, maybe I can get you on the boat.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.098
Y'know, there might be room.
I'll put in a call.

35:02.391 --> 35:04.519
I don't know
about tempting, y'know.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.773
But y'know, figures are figures, Lou.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.484
You start really
thinking about this shit, and...

35:12.193 --> 35:15.696
Y'know, I think about those kids
I saw over at Needles' firehouse, man.

35:15.696 --> 35:17.865
I mean, they're kids.
They're really kids.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.075
- Hmm.
- Y'know?

35:19.075 --> 35:21.244
And then I think about
our probie, y'know.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.204
What he was like
when he first came in here.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.747
He didn't know his ass from his elbow.

35:24.747 --> 35:27.458
And you think about this kid
y'know, in a fire,

35:27.458 --> 35:30.169
then you think about
what he did just in the stack house thing,

35:30.169 --> 35:32.547
man he was key.
He was the man that day,

35:32.547 --> 35:34.507
and he learned all that shit from us.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.051
Those kids in Needles' firehouse,
like that's what he's doing.

35:37.051 --> 35:39.512
I think you have a responsibility
to teach them enough

35:39.512 --> 35:42.306
enough so they can handle it
before you leave them on their own.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.891
Yeah, y'know, but...

35:44.934 --> 35:47.103
At what point does it stop, T?

35:48.688 --> 35:51.065
I mean, what point do you stand back
and say to yourself,

35:51.065 --> 35:53.568
"Jeez, y'know,
I'm lucky to still be alive."

35:53.568 --> 35:56.237
And that y'know,
there's a little time left.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.614
I mean, y'know, you've got two kids,
what about them?

36:05.913 --> 36:08.958
- Tom? Sorry.
- Oh, Jesus! What the hell?

36:08.958 --> 36:11.252
What? Why is everybody
sneaking up on me today?

36:11.252 --> 36:13.963
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- About what?

36:14.130 --> 36:16.132
It's sort of about the gay thing.

36:16.132 --> 36:20.094
Mikey, I really don't feel like
talking about the gay thing right now.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.762
I know you've just been so supportive,

36:21.762 --> 36:24.223
I thought maybe
I could get some advice, y'know.

36:25.099 --> 36:27.101
About what?

36:27.977 --> 36:31.105
Well, I was in Barneys yesterday,
I went to get a new shirt,

36:31.105 --> 36:32.982
and I wandered around
for like three hours.

36:32.982 --> 36:36.277
That can happen with anybody.
You're looking at ties and whatever.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.238
- You lose track of...
- Well, they were selling face cream.

36:39.238 --> 36:43.284
Y'know, like face cream for guys,
and I tried a sample,

36:43.284 --> 36:45.244
and my pores felt great.

36:45.870 --> 36:49.248
Franco uses face creams. I mean,
that doesn't mean anything, y'know.

36:49.248 --> 36:53.169
On my way home,
I stopped, and I got a pedicure.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.421
Again, I mean, that's not my thing, but--

36:55.421 --> 36:58.341
And then, I got my ass waxed.

37:04.430 --> 37:07.767
You got any girls left on your cell phone?
Any numbers?

37:07.767 --> 37:09.560
- Yeah.
- Well, you need to call

37:09.560 --> 37:12.021
some girl that you know.
Some girl that you can, y'know,

37:12.021 --> 37:13.522
- screw around with.
- Yeah.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.358
I mean, that's the best thing
I can tell you.

37:15.358 --> 37:20.279
You just gotta remind yourself how,
how great chicks are, y'know.

37:20.279 --> 37:22.740
Remind yourself how soft their hair is.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.409
How soft their skin is,
what they smell like.

37:25.826 --> 37:29.288
Y'know, the curve of their hips.
Tits, kid. Think tits.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.498
Thanks, T.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.920
Yoo-hoo, Tom, it's Sheila.
I got a little message for you.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.464
I found a couple of those
you know whatskis

37:38.464 --> 37:40.049
in Damien's room
that you were looking for,

37:40.049 --> 37:42.051
so, I don't know, call me back,

37:42.051 --> 37:44.929
or just stop by after work
and pick them up, okay?

37:44.929 --> 37:46.264
Ooh, I gotta go. Okay, bye.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.391
Hi. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.269
Miss Keefe, Janine Klein.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.521
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.899
So, I understand you're interested
in our beachfront properties.

37:56.899 --> 38:00.569
I am. I am actually
interested in this one specifically.

38:00.569 --> 38:01.904
That's my favorite.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.572
And my friend, my male friend,

38:03.572 --> 38:05.616
my male friend that I was just
on the phone with,

38:05.616 --> 38:09.787
who's actually my late husband's cousin
who may at some point be living with me

38:09.787 --> 38:11.455
in this home, it's so complicated,

38:11.455 --> 38:14.333
I'll tell you about it later.
Anyway, this is his favorite, too.

38:15.084 --> 38:18.170
- Okay. Oh, yes.
- It's still available, right?

38:18.170 --> 38:21.590
Good. I'll take it.

38:22.174 --> 38:25.177
Um, don't you want
to see the property first?

38:25.177 --> 38:27.305
Well, does it look
like it does in the pictures?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.265
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

38:29.265 --> 38:32.184
And, um, it's pretty on the inside?

38:32.685 --> 38:33.769
It's adorable.

38:33.769 --> 38:35.146
Then it's mine.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.358
Who should I make this out to?

38:45.614 --> 38:46.657
Hey.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.534
Hello.

38:49.201 --> 38:52.413
You ain't returning any of my calls,
and that is just not very polite.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.915
Yeah, well, you're the expert on polite.

38:54.915 --> 38:56.751
Oh, wait. No, you're not.

38:58.377 --> 38:59.670
I got you a present.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.885
Two avocados?

39:05.885 --> 39:08.846
Yeah, well, I was trying
to come up with a peace offering.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.598
I thought I'd make you a cake
or something,

39:10.598 --> 39:12.600
only, I don't know
how to cook or any of that.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.477
I thought I'd go to the store,
buy you a cake,

39:14.477 --> 39:15.936
only they're too expensive.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.481
And I can't go to my bakery
because I told the guy

39:18.481 --> 39:20.566
that his cannolis
tasted like cat piss.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.068
So I got the avocados.

39:22.818 --> 39:23.944
I think they're ripe.

39:24.737 --> 39:27.365
Okay, well, I, um,
I talked to Father Dan,

39:27.365 --> 39:30.409
or tried to, turns out
we've been banned

39:30.409 --> 39:33.371
from getting married
anywhere near the diocese much less in it.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.332
Well, Sean, I am sorry. I really am.

39:36.832 --> 39:39.043
Can you not hear me saying it? I am sorry.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.338
Maggie Gavin is saying she's sorry.

39:42.963 --> 39:44.840
She must really be in love, huh?

39:48.511 --> 39:50.096
She is, Sean.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.806
In letters eight miles high.

39:52.348 --> 39:54.141
Well, y'know what, Maggie,
after your performance

39:54.141 --> 39:56.018
the other day with the priest, I went home

39:56.018 --> 39:58.771
and I was really upset,
and I was thinking about you,

39:58.771 --> 40:00.356
and I threw up.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.566
I thought to myself,
I'm not the smartest guy on the planet,

40:02.566 --> 40:04.318
but maybe you shouldn't
get married to a person

40:04.318 --> 40:06.362
that actually makes
you throw up.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.198
Okay, I don't like to puke.

40:10.157 --> 40:11.909
It's not gonna work.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.744
Sean.

40:15.037 --> 40:18.499
You're making me cry.
You're such an asshole!

40:20.543 --> 40:24.380
Sean, that is so unfair!

40:26.590 --> 40:31.429
Here you go, Mike, sangria.
My own kick-ass recipe.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.348
I made a great, big batch of it
in honor of your moving in.

40:34.348 --> 40:36.517
Hey, you hear that?

40:37.601 --> 40:40.354
Never got any goddamn
sangria at your place.

40:40.354 --> 40:43.232
So listen up, before
you two punks hit the bricks,

40:43.232 --> 40:45.234
I got a couple of things
I want to make clear.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.945
This is my house,
we go by my rules.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.029
You hear that, Dad?

40:49.029 --> 40:51.532
Hey, I'm not talking to him, ass face,
I'm talking to you two.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.868
Ass face? That's a good one, Red.

40:54.410 --> 40:57.455
You don't show up unannounced.
You call first.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.123
'Cause we might be busy.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.750
Or we may not be in the mood
to look at your ugly mugs.

41:01.750 --> 41:05.171
If we need something from you,
we'll call you, otherwise, back off.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.756
I catch you snooping around,
checking on us,

41:07.756 --> 41:09.300
there'll be a beating in it for you.

41:09.925 --> 41:12.178
Look at 'em, Red.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.971
You know <i>Dumb and Dumber?</i>

41:14.138 --> 41:16.182
This is Dickless and Dicklesser.

41:20.352 --> 41:21.395
Ready to go?

41:27.443 --> 41:30.404
- How do you feel?
- So much better. That was incredible.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.324
I'm always here to help, Mike.

41:33.699 --> 41:36.869
You have another crisis,
just give me a call.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.412
You think I'm okay?

41:38.579 --> 41:39.830
What do you think?

41:40.247 --> 41:42.082
I think I'd like a sandwich.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.044
Good for you, slugger.

41:53.219 --> 41:55.262
Y'know...

41:55.429 --> 41:59.892
Your hair's like,
so soft and silky.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.727
It smells so good.

42:02.770 --> 42:06.023
What do you use? Like, some kind of,
like, nice conditioner or something?

42:06.023 --> 42:08.234
'Cause you know, my 'do's really been
bumming me out lately.

42:08.234 --> 42:11.987
I feel like I got this, like,
dry hair and split ends and...

42:13.155 --> 42:14.448
What are you doing?

42:14.448 --> 42:15.866
We gotta go again.

42:19.453 --> 42:21.205
Oh, God!

42:22.915 --> 42:25.668
- Oh! Whew!
- Oh, man!

42:25.834 --> 42:29.463
Oh, yeah, wicked,
wicked man, Mr. Reilly.

42:29.463 --> 42:32.675
Well, that I am.
Everything all right?

42:32.841 --> 42:37.263
Glorious. I'm very impressed
by your stamina.

42:38.222 --> 42:41.809
I mean, Mr. Wonderful here,
we had a little help.

42:41.809 --> 42:47.481
Oh, and they say it's hard
to find good help these days.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.570
Madonna?

42:52.736 --> 42:56.240
Yeah. She's awesome, man.
She's a badass bitch.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.242
I can't believe
I'm actually hearing this.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.244
The wifey wanted to go see it.

43:00.953 --> 43:04.039
Y'know, so we wanted
to spend some QT together.

43:04.206 --> 43:06.667
And don't make the obvious
queer time joke either, bro. That's old.

43:06.667 --> 43:07.918
Look, this ain't about queers.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.670
I mean, Madonna's whole show
is full of them.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.880
- Right?
- Right. There's about 40 of them

43:11.880 --> 43:16.135
dancing up on stage. Maybe 15 costume
changes for her and the guys.

43:16.760 --> 43:17.928
It's deep, bro.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.890
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.350
What's wrong, baby?

43:23.350 --> 43:25.477
God, my chest.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.230
- Jerry, what is it?
- I can't breathe.

43:28.230 --> 43:29.315
Tell me what's wrong.

43:29.315 --> 43:31.984
Oh, God. I think you better
call somebody. Oh, God!

43:33.027 --> 43:34.945
- You're gonna be okay.
- Please, call somebody.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.947
Don't worry.
You're gonna be fine.

43:37.072 --> 43:40.451
Karlene, call 911.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.119
You don't need to call anybody.

43:42.119 --> 43:45.497
- You need to call somebody. I need help.
- Nobody can know about this.

43:45.497 --> 43:48.542
They'll find out I was here.
I'll lose my job. I'll lose everything.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.421
I was never here, Jerry.
You gotta remember that.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.965
Karlene, you gotta--
Karlene, please, wait. Help me here.

44:09.188 --> 44:10.689
I got one word for you.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.984
- Faggy?
- No. Cher.

44:14.401 --> 44:18.113
Oh, Jesus. It's 4:30 in the morning. This
is no time to be having this discussion.

44:18.113 --> 44:20.824
Hey, there's no smoking in the car, bro.
Take the smoke out.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.285
You're gonna mess up my new shirt.

44:23.869 --> 44:27.081
Listen, Luis, Luis.

44:27.289 --> 44:29.208
Let me break it down to you,
all right?

44:29.375 --> 44:31.293
Cher, she invented that shit.

44:31.543 --> 44:33.629
I saw her live like
ten, twelve years ago.

44:34.254 --> 44:37.966
And every outfit that she changed into,
every pair of pants...

44:38.133 --> 44:39.927
- Yeah?
- Assless.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.387
- You mean like those...
- Yeah.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.806
I'm talking no material
covering the ass area.

44:44.098 --> 44:47.643
Bare assed, assed out,
dancing on the stage for two hours.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.145
And Cher's got a gold medal ass.

44:50.396 --> 44:53.232
You tell your little friend
Madonna to match that action.

44:54.817 --> 44:58.570
Does Cher have a song where
all the gay dancers roller-skate?

44:58.821 --> 45:01.323
Madonna had roller-skating?

45:04.993 --> 45:06.412
Johnny! Johnny!

45:06.412 --> 45:10.165
Johnny, Johnny, hey, hey!
Hey, you okay? Can you hear me?

45:10.165 --> 45:12.543
Johnny! Jesus! Jesus!

45:14.336 --> 45:18.173
Dispatch! Dispatch! 10-13.
Officer down, dispatch. Officer down.

45:18.173 --> 45:20.050
We need an ambulance ASAP.

45:20.050 --> 45:23.345
Where are we, where are we?
131st and St. Nick.

45:23.345 --> 45:25.180
We need an ambulance now.

45:25.347 --> 45:28.851
Partner shot.
Three shots to the chest. We need backup.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.437
We need an ambulance. 10-13.
