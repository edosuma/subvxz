00:01.305 --> 00:02.741
<i>Previously on</i> Alaska Daily...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.830
Lunch today-- you, me,
and our esteemed publisher,

00:04.830 --> 00:06.093
- Aaron Pritchard.
- Hard pass.

00:06.093 --> 00:07.833
Humor me.
His family keeps the lights on.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.574
I keep a room right here
at Captain Cook,

00:09.574 --> 00:11.663
so we're neighbors.

00:11.663 --> 00:12.969
<i>Hello,
Eileen. Did you get my e-mail?</i>

00:12.969 --> 00:14.536
Hello, concerned citizen.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.407
How nice of you
to call again.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.626
First time
in the Arctic?

00:17.626 --> 00:19.541
Have you been up here
before?

00:19.541 --> 00:21.586
Some.
I don't really like it.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.197
There would have been 3 feet
of snow on the ground

00:23.197 --> 00:24.372
the night she went missing.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.461
I think I'm angry.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.679
The paper is looking into
some older cases.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.159
For some reason we can't
get our hands

00:29.159 --> 00:31.901
on Gloria Namnac's
police report.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.077
Hey, Derek.
We're trying to get ahold

00:34.077 --> 00:35.861
of the police department's
monthly reports.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.559
I'm not sure
if I'm allowed to do that.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.039
I'm upset that you went
behind my back.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.605
This isn't about you.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.433
It's about the story.
That's all that matters.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.044
Is that right?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.785
72 felony complaints
and not one charge.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.352
Why aren't you investigating
violent crimes

00:48.352 --> 00:49.701
against native women?

00:49.701 --> 00:51.051
Durkin's going bye-bye.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.443
Good work, team.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.923
One thing-- you may not
want to admit it,

00:53.923 --> 00:55.881
but you need me
on this investigation,

00:55.881 --> 00:57.318
so I gotta be able
to trust you.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.581
Just to say, no one complained
when I worked alone.

01:31.961 --> 01:35.312
All right, gang,
the weekend is almost upon us,

01:35.312 --> 01:38.924
but as most of you know,
it's not just any weekend--

01:38.924 --> 01:42.014
it is opening weekend
of the state fair.

01:42.014 --> 01:46.367
Need I remind you,
300,000 people go to the fair.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.760
That's over half the state.

01:48.760 --> 01:53.156
It might not be hard news,
but it matters to Alaskans,

01:53.156 --> 01:54.810
so it matters to us.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.812
Good speech.
I'm in.

01:56.812 --> 01:57.987
As usual,
I'll cover entertainment.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.162
Headliner this year?

01:59.162 --> 02:01.730
Hootie and the Blowfish.
I'm a fan.

02:01.730 --> 02:04.080
I'll be food, and, yes,
I'll be covering

02:04.080 --> 02:05.864
the Denali cream puffs.

02:05.864 --> 02:08.215
- Miles?
- I'm all over everything.

02:08.215 --> 02:11.174
And, for what it's worth,
I dig the fair.

02:11.174 --> 02:14.830
Because Austin went to Bethel
to cover the fisheries council,

02:14.830 --> 02:18.138
we'll need someone to do double
duty to cover the pig races.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.966
Oh, I'll do it.
I'll-- I'll bring my son, Finn.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.665
It's gonna make his year.
He loves the pig races.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.275
You talking politics again?

02:25.275 --> 02:27.930
Uh, nope. Real pigs. Racing.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.150
- With kids.
- With kids?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.108
- It's a thing.
- The state fair.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.414
Oh, yeah.
I heard about that.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.111
It's all very Alaskan.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.722
We leave our cynicism at home
when we cover the fair, Eileen.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.855
I'm sure we do.
Are you going?

02:39.855 --> 02:43.119
I've been asked to judge the jam
competition again this year.

02:43.119 --> 02:44.903
- Well, that's just--
- An honor.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.731
Yeah, that.
And I was just gon--

02:46.731 --> 02:48.777
Returning to your work.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.300
Jam on.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.216
Finally, this year's
Giant Cabbage competition

02:53.216 --> 02:55.784
will be covered by...

02:55.784 --> 02:57.177
Gabriel Tovar.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.744
Really? Me?

02:59.744 --> 03:01.224
If that's okay with you.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.052
Are you kidding?
My first story?

03:03.052 --> 03:05.010
Absolutely.
Thank you, Stanley.

03:05.010 --> 03:08.013
I'll be here
most of the weekend.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.233
If you have something,
send it.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.975
All right, that's it.
Get to it.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.759
- And have some fun tomorrow.
- That's so amazing.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.065
Congratulations.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.459
What's the first name
of the Meade police chief

03:18.459 --> 03:20.069
before Durkin?

03:20.069 --> 03:22.027
- Oren.
- Oren Conners.

03:22.027 --> 03:24.073
I looked up his address
on Nexis.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.205
There's nothing on him.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.467
Well, based on
what Durkin said,

03:26.467 --> 03:28.208
he could be living
on the street now.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.471
You know, we should try and get
a quote from the Governor

03:30.471 --> 03:31.907
on the Durkin story.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.213
Dig deeper,
try and find Skeeter.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.257
Are you free to work
this weekend?

03:34.257 --> 03:36.346
Nope. I'm busy.

03:36.346 --> 03:39.044
- Busy doing what?
- Tournament.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.046
What kind of tournament?

03:41.046 --> 03:43.135
Basketball.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.703
Look, I get that you're still
angry about what happened

03:45.703 --> 03:49.925
in Meade, but just to say it,
I miss the Chatty Sunny Roz.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.274
Knock, knock.
The Durkin story has pulled

03:51.274 --> 03:54.277
2,000 views and rising.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.539
And I just got word
the City Council

03:55.539 --> 03:58.803
is suspending Durkin
pending an investigation.

03:58.803 --> 03:59.978
Well done, you two.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.893
We still don't know
who killed Gloria.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.765
Let's hope your story
shakes something loose.

04:03.765 --> 04:06.811
But we could work
this weekend.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.379
You could.
Have a great weekend, guys.

04:09.379 --> 04:12.164
You, too.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.296
So, things are better.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.776
Much.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.473
Maybe you should take
the weekend off.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.170
Mm, no thanks.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.172
Besides, half your newsroom
is working this weekend.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.262
On the fair.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.829
Do you want to cover it?

04:24.829 --> 04:27.179
Weekends are good, Eileen.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.225
Weekends suck.
I'm here to do a job.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.139
And live.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.315
Job first.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.318
He tried to bribe you?

04:35.318 --> 04:37.581
I couldn't believe it.
The gall.

04:37.581 --> 04:40.149
Like I'd sacrifice
my integrity for $100.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.238
A hundred bucks?
It's not nothing.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.631
You can't be serious.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.373
- I mean, it's just jam.
- I'm a judge.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.200
It's the state fair.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.944
- What's that?
- I don't know.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.642
It was just left
on the front desk.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.773
Janice gave it to me.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.558
Does she know
who it's from?

04:57.558 --> 04:59.690
She didn't see.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.260
Oh, fan mail.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.309
That's a bullet.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.136
It is, indeed.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.181
That's a funny way
of proposing.

05:12.181 --> 05:14.052
Is that how they do it
in Alaska?

05:14.052 --> 05:15.750
Gabriel, did Janice see
who left the package?

05:15.750 --> 05:16.925
No.
She was in the bathroom.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.318
We need to call
the police.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.145
You have a camera
in the lobby?

05:20.145 --> 05:22.452
No. We had one
in the old place.

05:22.452 --> 05:25.194
Eileen, you need to let
Stanley know, and the lawyers.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.413
- This is serious.
- She's right.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.328
I'm not sure
that'll do much good,

05:28.328 --> 05:30.547
but if it makes
you feel better, fine.

05:30.547 --> 05:33.289
For the record,
I've gotten much worse.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.856
At least this is
in a pretty box.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.777
Can I share
some good news with you?

05:42.777 --> 05:45.388
Please do.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.347
I got my first assignment.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.305
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.393
Covering what?

05:50.393 --> 05:53.657
Giant Cabbages.
At the State Fair.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.267
You won't forget that one.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.617
Any tips?

05:56.617 --> 05:57.705
Make sure
you get the correct spelling

05:57.705 --> 05:58.923
of your subjects' name.

05:58.923 --> 06:01.404
You'd be surprised
how many people don't.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.015
That's good.
Okay. Thanks.

06:04.015 --> 06:06.061
Yup.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.846
Hey, that bullet...
Does it worry you?

06:08.846 --> 06:13.460
I don't love it, but I see crap
like that as a badge of honor.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.027
People get upset when the lights
get turned on

06:16.027 --> 06:17.551
and the truth is laid bare.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.771
I see.

06:20.771 --> 06:23.905
Don't let it worry you, really.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.211
And hey, have fun
with your story.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.604
It's a good one.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.867
I will.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.347
Have a good weekend.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.217
Will do.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.698
Eileen Fitzgerald.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.439
<i>Did you get my gift?</i>

06:36.439 --> 06:38.441
I did.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.704
Things are getting serious
between us.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.272
<i>Oh, you just can't help
yourself, can you?</i>

06:43.272 --> 06:45.143
Care to elaborate?

06:45.143 --> 06:47.232
<i>You destroyed a man's life.</i>

06:47.232 --> 06:50.148
Durkin?
He did that to himself.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.847
<i>Yeah, everyone's wrong
except you.</i>

06:52.847 --> 06:54.805
<i>I won't watch you
turn our state upside down</i>

06:54.805 --> 06:57.242
<i>just because you were
run out of New York.</i>

06:57.242 --> 06:59.244
Is that what you think
happened?

06:59.244 --> 07:01.464
<i>I know it. We all do.</i>

07:01.464 --> 07:03.684
<i>The next bullet you receive
won't be in a box.</i>

07:33.453 --> 07:35.498
Hello, my friend.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.457
Where were we?

07:53.124 --> 07:56.911
<i>♪ Southwind</i>

07:56.911 --> 07:59.043
<i>♪ I need a forty-dollar ticket♪</i>

07:59.043 --> 08:02.786
<i>♪ And about this time tomorrow
I'll be gone ♪</i>

08:02.786 --> 08:05.920
That looks so good!
Hi, I'm Yuna Park...

08:05.920 --> 08:07.269
<i>♪ Southwind</i>

08:09.184 --> 08:10.838

Hold on, everyone!

08:27.811 --> 08:32.990
We're at the last one,
and it looks like a doozy!

08:32.990 --> 08:34.296
How's it going, my friend?

08:34.296 --> 08:36.690
I'm actually a little nervous.
Is that crazy?

08:36.690 --> 08:37.995
No way.

08:37.995 --> 08:40.955
You're nervous
because you care.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.218
Want a gummy?
It might help.

08:43.218 --> 08:45.220
Weed gummy?
No, no, thank you.

08:45.220 --> 08:48.615
I need to stay focused.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.312
Me, too.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.922
All right, here comes
the judge.

08:51.922 --> 08:55.056
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's official.

08:55.056 --> 08:58.059
The winner of the biggest
cabbage contest,

08:58.059 --> 09:02.585
weighing in at 135 pounds, is...

09:02.585 --> 09:03.673
Erica Block!

09:09.810 --> 09:11.333
It's go time, homie.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.905
Hi.
Sorry to interrupt.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.211
I'm Gabriel Tovar
with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

09:20.211 --> 09:22.562
Congratulations on your win.
That must be so exciting.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.128
Thank you.

09:24.128 --> 09:25.695
Can I get a proper
spelling of your name?

09:25.695 --> 09:28.002
Erica, E-R-I-C-A.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.307
Block, B-L-O-C-K.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.613
- Oh.
- Oh.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.615
- Ah!
- Ah! Sorry--

09:32.615 --> 09:34.530
- Me, too.
- I'm so sorry.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.054
- I'm very nervous.
- So am I.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.927
I've-- [laughs] I've never
talked to a reporter before.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.537
You're my very first interview,

09:41.537 --> 09:43.887
so I guess we can be
nervous buddies together.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.456
Um, and has it always
been your dream

09:47.456 --> 09:49.197
to win
the largest cabbage award?

09:49.197 --> 09:51.982
Uh, I just kind of
fell into it, I guess.

09:51.982 --> 09:55.551
We grow cabbage,
and they grew really big, so...

09:55.551 --> 09:57.597
why not?

09:57.597 --> 10:01.165
And now tomorrow, you'll
be crowned Biggest Cabbage.

10:01.165 --> 10:04.038
Or, I guess
your cabbage will.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.431
Um, that must feel great.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.042
It kind of does.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.610
- Erica.
- Okay, I'm coming.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.002
Uh, sorry.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.569
That's my dad.

10:13.569 --> 10:14.962
It was nice to meet you, Gabriel.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.007
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow
at the ceremony.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.444
I hope so. Bye.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.621
Bye.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.034
Gabriel?

10:44.034 --> 10:45.340
<i>Hi, Eileen.</i>

10:45.340 --> 10:46.907
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt
your work.</i>

10:46.907 --> 10:48.038
What's up?

10:48.038 --> 10:50.127
So, I have a problem.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.695
I just wrote up my story
and it...

10:52.695 --> 10:53.957
it's not very good.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.002
<i>Why?</i>

10:55.002 --> 10:56.220
It just-- It's--

10:56.220 --> 10:58.962
It's a little short,
and it feels a little--

10:58.962 --> 11:00.529
Boring?

11:00.529 --> 11:02.139
<i>Yeah, boring is accurate.</i>

11:02.139 --> 11:04.576
Well, it is about cabbages.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.230
<i>Look, just keep digging.</i>

11:06.230 --> 11:07.797
<i>In print, you have
the opportunity to go deeper.</i>

11:07.797 --> 11:09.625
<i>Go talk to the subject again.</i>

11:09.625 --> 11:12.193
Okay.
Yeah, um, I'll see her tomorrow

11:12.193 --> 11:14.282
at the award presentation.
I guess I could ask--

11:14.282 --> 11:16.110
You're doing a story
about cabbages.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.546
Go to the farm.
That's where the story is.

11:17.546 --> 11:18.765
<i>Okay, thing is, is I--</i>

11:18.765 --> 11:21.158
I didn't get an address
or a phone number.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.986
Gabriel,
it's a working farm.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.727
Track her down.
That's what we do.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.990
<i>- You're right.</i>
- Gotta go.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.732
<i>♪ Keep the motion up</i>

11:31.734 --> 11:33.214
<i>♪ Keep the motion up</i>

11:36.652 --> 11:37.958
<i>♪ Keep the motion up</i>

11:40.917 --> 11:43.528
- <i>
- ♪ Keep the motion up</i>

11:46.793 --> 11:48.229
<i>♪ Keep the motion up</i>

11:55.062 --> 11:57.847
Well, next round's on me
as a gesture of appreciation

11:57.847 --> 12:01.024
for letting us totally...

12:01.024 --> 12:02.939
own you guys!

12:05.333 --> 12:08.075
Look at you. That gussak you're
working for is rubbing off.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.772
Mnh-mnh. Nope.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.557
No, I told you.
No work talk.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.734
- I need a break from that place.
- Come on.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.431
You had to know we would be
grilling you about

12:16.431 --> 12:19.260
that fancy New York white woman
coming to take your job.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.827
That's never going
to happen.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.046
So, what's she like?

12:23.046 --> 12:24.439
Give us some dirt.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.484
Ugh.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.704
You know those geese
that come up every summer?

12:28.704 --> 12:31.663
They don't stay here for long,
but they make a lot of noise,

12:31.663 --> 12:33.274
and they act like
they run the place?

12:33.274 --> 12:35.667
Mm-hmm.

12:35.667 --> 12:38.061
So why didn't they just let you
do the story on your own?

12:38.061 --> 12:41.282
Editor's call.
It's a big story.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.501
He wanted her experience.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.329
Yeah, but is she gonna do
what they always do--

12:45.329 --> 12:48.593
write some stories and split
after exploiting our pain?

12:48.593 --> 12:50.117
Not if I have
a say in it.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.162
That piece you did on that
Meade cop was awesome.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.121
Yeah. It was.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.471
Thanks.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.824
Hey!

13:01.824 --> 13:03.217
- How's the food?
- Good.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.088
All of it.
Too much of it.

13:05.088 --> 13:07.264
Hi, Finn.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.005
Ooh, thank you.
Finn, you remember Yuna.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.572
- Say hi.
- Hi.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.008
You having fun?

13:12.008 --> 13:13.836
The pigs are pretty cool.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.404
The pigs are faster
than usual this year,

13:16.404 --> 13:19.189
and they definitely
play dirty.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.017
Doping?

13:21.017 --> 13:24.847
Yeah,
I wouldn't be surprised.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.631
Austin's really missing
the bigger story here.

13:26.631 --> 13:27.894
Hmm.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.985
What's going on
with you two?

13:31.985 --> 13:34.596
What? Nothing.
We're just...

13:34.596 --> 13:37.207
Smiling at each other
a lot?

13:37.207 --> 13:39.296
I don't know.

13:39.296 --> 13:42.212
Austin's a really great guy,
but he's got a lot on his plate

13:42.212 --> 13:44.649
with his ex-wife and son
and everything,

13:44.649 --> 13:47.739
and we work together.

13:47.739 --> 13:50.090
- Huh.
-"Huh" what?

13:50.090 --> 13:52.483
I don't know.
Maybe don't overthink it.

13:52.483 --> 13:53.658
Men usually don't.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.269
Mom, look!
Here they come!

13:55.269 --> 13:56.531
Oh, here they come!
Here it comes around the corner!

13:56.531 --> 13:59.316
We got Bacon!
We got Billy!

14:10.414 --> 14:12.373
- Gabriel, hi.
- Hi, Erica.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.375
I realized my story
was a little thin,

14:14.375 --> 14:17.334
and I was hoping I could ask you
a few more questions.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.815
Um, okay.

14:19.815 --> 14:22.165
Um...

14:22.165 --> 14:23.863
What kind of questions?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.169
Nothing too serious,
I promise.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.738
Hey. Who's this?

14:29.738 --> 14:32.828
Hello, sir. Gabriel Tovar
with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

14:32.828 --> 14:34.917
I interviewed Erica
after her win at the fair.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.528
Oh. What brings you by
today, Gabriel?

14:37.528 --> 14:40.357
Oh, I was hoping to see
where the cabbages are grown,

14:40.357 --> 14:43.056
learn a little bit more
about your process.

14:43.056 --> 14:46.276
I'm just trying
to flesh out my reporting.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.322
I think Erica can help you
out with that.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.584
You game, sweetheart?

14:49.584 --> 14:52.065
- Yeah.
- There you go.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.675
Come on inside.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.773
Do you mind putting
your cellphone in the box?

15:04.773 --> 15:06.949
It's a house rule we have.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.472
We like everyone to stay
present at the farm.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.431
Cellphones tend to get
in the way of that.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.085
I hope that's okay?

15:12.085 --> 15:14.391
Yeah, if it's a house rule,
it's okay with me.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.306
All I need is my pad.

15:16.306 --> 15:19.092
I appreciate that.

15:19.092 --> 15:23.879
Is the no phone rule part
of your farming philosophy?

15:23.879 --> 15:25.272
I guess you could say that.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.709
Yeah, we believe
in a simpler lifestyle.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.102
I used to work
in the tech industry,

15:29.102 --> 15:30.320
and I had an epiphany

15:30.320 --> 15:31.974
that they were doing
more harm than good.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.541
I see.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.674
And can you give me any examples
of the harm technology does,

15:36.674 --> 15:39.982
and what you prefer
about farm life?

15:39.982 --> 15:41.679
Lots.

15:41.679 --> 15:44.291
But I assure you, it would
bore you and your readers.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.989
So, uh, I should get
back to work.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.383
And, uh, you two can get
started on your tour.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.602
Right, of course.
Thank you for your time.

16:09.446 --> 16:10.882
<i>Hi, Eileen.
It's Rushmi.</i>

16:10.882 --> 16:12.319
<i>It's been a while.</i>

16:12.319 --> 16:14.451
<i>I just read your reporting
from Alaska.</i>

16:14.451 --> 16:17.106
<i>Not surprisingly,
it's very good work.</i>

16:17.106 --> 16:18.673
<i>I'm glad you found
a new home.</i>

16:18.673 --> 16:20.501
<i>You're missed here
at</i> The Vanguard.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.111
<i>I'm here if you ever
want to connect.</i>

17:04.066 --> 17:06.590
Excuse me.
I need some room.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.029
Hey!

17:26.567 --> 17:30.223
Hey.
How you feeling?

17:30.223 --> 17:31.702
What happened?

17:31.702 --> 17:33.530
You passed out,
hit your head.

17:33.530 --> 17:36.359
I think you're gonna need
a couple of stitches.

17:36.359 --> 17:37.969
What are you doing here?

17:37.969 --> 17:39.928
First on the scene.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.017
- Terrific.
- Whoa, hey, Eileen.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.801
I need you to take some
big breaths for me, okay?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.499
Your heart rate
is still pretty high.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.457
I'm fine. Can you take me back
to the hotel?

17:47.457 --> 17:48.850
Uh, no.
They need to examine you,

17:48.850 --> 17:50.243
figure out what happened.

17:50.243 --> 17:53.594
I know what happened.
Can you just take me home?

17:53.594 --> 17:55.074
What happened?

18:00.122 --> 18:02.255
I had a panic attack.

18:06.128 --> 18:09.436
Oh, my God.
That is very unpleasant.

18:09.436 --> 18:13.135
Yeah. That's the salmon part of
the organic salmon fertilizer.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.833
It's not too good on the nose,
but it works magic.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.358
Yeah, noted.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.489
Come on, I'll show you
where the cabbage grows.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.361
It's really pretty.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.974
Wow.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.498
I guess I'll have to sketch it
since I don't have my phone.

18:28.498 --> 18:31.675
Yeah, sorry about that.

18:31.675 --> 18:35.114
My dad is kind of intense
when it comes to technology.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.507
Is it more than cellphones?

18:37.507 --> 18:41.120
Everything-- computers,
TVs, anything with a chip.

18:41.120 --> 18:45.559
Wow. I don't think I could live
without my devices.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.777
What about at school?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.562
Home-schooled.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.520
Oh, by your parents?

18:51.913 --> 18:54.959
My dad. Um...

18:54.959 --> 18:57.962
My mom died when I was 11.

18:57.962 --> 19:01.096
I'm sorry.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.968
She got cancer.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.014
Brain tumor.

19:06.014 --> 19:09.452
My dad became convinced
it was from her cellphone.

19:09.452 --> 19:12.455
Oh. So, that explains--

19:12.455 --> 19:14.849
Yeah, he just changed.

19:14.849 --> 19:18.635
Everything about our life
was suddenly dangerous.

19:18.635 --> 19:21.072
He said we have to stop
feeding the monster

19:21.072 --> 19:24.032
and that technology
was eating us alive.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.121
And then we moved here.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.603
So is it just the two of you
on the farm?

19:29.603 --> 19:32.475
I mean, we have some people
who help us with the work,

19:32.475 --> 19:35.086
but, yeah, it's mostly
just me and my dad.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.831
And the only other time
I see people is at church.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.398
Where do you go to church?

19:42.398 --> 19:44.313
The Holy Cross Lutheran Church.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.493
How long have you been
having panic attacks?

19:50.493 --> 19:51.842
I'm a newbie.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.714
It was my 3rd.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.064
Have you been under a lot
of stress recently?

19:56.064 --> 19:59.720
No. I don't know.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.635
Yeah.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.158
Was there anything
that you could point to

20:03.158 --> 20:04.464
that precipitated it?

20:04.464 --> 20:06.727
I got jostled by a few
Swedish tourists

20:06.727 --> 20:09.077
in the elevator.
That's about it.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.600
When can I leave?

20:10.600 --> 20:12.472
I'm sorry, but you really
clonked your head.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.430
I need to make sure that you
don't have a concussion,

20:14.430 --> 20:16.737
and I need to keep you under
observation for a few hours.

20:16.737 --> 20:20.436
A few hours?

20:20.436 --> 20:22.264
Hey.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.396
You're still here.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.747
I'm not about to leave
you here alone.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.575
How are you?

20:28.575 --> 20:29.967
Fine.

20:31.621 --> 20:34.058
Can you stop staring at me
with that face?

20:36.191 --> 20:38.628
Any idea what triggered it?

20:38.628 --> 20:40.717
Can we not talk
about this right now?

20:40.717 --> 20:41.849
Of course.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.635
That-- That piece you did
with Durkin

20:45.635 --> 20:48.464
was really excellent reporting.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.685
Great. Can we get
a bigger travel budget?

20:53.556 --> 20:55.732
Might need to wait
a little bit on that one.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.212
Why can't you
just authorize it?

20:57.212 --> 20:59.606
Or does your dad really hold
the purse strings?

21:02.391 --> 21:06.177
I'm sorry. I have a terrible
personality when I unravel.

21:06.177 --> 21:07.788
Don't we all.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.572
But I understand
your frustrations

21:09.572 --> 21:12.575
with the budget
at the paper.

21:12.575 --> 21:13.663
I'm doing my best.

21:13.663 --> 21:16.797
I just hope
that you can be patient.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.190
I think I got the patient
thing down.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.891
You know, my dad
could be intense, too.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.633
Yeah? In what way?

21:26.633 --> 21:30.245
Well, mostly work.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.378
He worked in the oil industry.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.683
He was disappointed
I didn't go to work with him,

21:33.683 --> 21:36.686
but I have no interest in it.

21:36.686 --> 21:39.863
Well, I think it's brave
for you to go on your own.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.997
I couldn't do that
with my dad.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.607
Are you worried about him?

21:44.607 --> 21:48.132
I mean, he's just been different
since my mom passed.

21:49.264 --> 21:52.267
Can you give me an example?

21:52.267 --> 21:55.705
Like, he started going
to these meetings.

21:55.705 --> 21:58.055
Anti-technology meetings?

21:58.055 --> 22:02.669
Yeah. That's when he started
to become moody and secretive.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.932
Secretive how?

22:04.932 --> 22:06.586
Like, this barn...

22:06.586 --> 22:08.718
I've been playing in there
since I was a kid,

22:08.718 --> 22:12.113
and one day,
he just told me to stay out.

22:12.113 --> 22:13.419
Can I see what's inside?

22:13.419 --> 22:15.899
Well, he locked it.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.511
That's what I mean.
It's weird.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.820
I'm just worried he's going
too far with it all.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.169
What's too far?

22:25.169 --> 22:27.650
I don't know.

22:27.650 --> 22:30.000
I-- Can we not talk
about this anymore, Gabriel?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.045
Sure.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.490
Can we keep this between us?

22:41.490 --> 22:44.014
Sure.

22:44.014 --> 22:46.626
But you do have someone that
you can talk to about it, right?

22:46.626 --> 22:48.018
In Alaska?

22:48.018 --> 22:49.672
How about in New York?

22:49.672 --> 22:52.327
Someone you trust?

22:52.327 --> 22:55.286
I'm not sure I trust myself
at this point.

22:55.286 --> 22:58.289
Well, you gotta figure out
why this is happening.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.683
I gotta figure out
how to get out of here.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.993
The Jello looks really good
in the cafeteria.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.212
What about some of that
for now?

23:08.212 --> 23:10.693
Sure. Lemon.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.303
Uh, thank you again, sir.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.131
Your farm is very impressive.

23:14.131 --> 23:16.177
Oh, you're welcome.
It was a pleasure having you.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.092
And good luck
with your article.

23:18.092 --> 23:20.442
Oh, right-- cellphone.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.531
Unless, of course, you're
willing to live without it.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.925
Uh, not quite yet,
but thank you.

23:24.925 --> 23:27.754
All right.

23:27.754 --> 23:29.712
And thank you for the tour.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.410
I think I got what I needed.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.803
You're welcome.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.503
And you know where to reach me
if you ever want to talk.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.766
I think you're really nice
and smart,

23:39.766 --> 23:41.855
and I'm glad
that you're a reporter.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.653
Gabriel.

24:40.653 --> 24:41.741
How'd you get in here?

24:41.741 --> 24:45.092
I'm just taking
a look around.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.876
It's helpful to see what
it takes to make a farm work,

24:46.876 --> 24:49.009
for my story.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.314
Well, I'm glad
you find that interesting,

24:50.314 --> 24:52.403
but I think it's time
for you to leave now.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.536
Oh, of course. Sure.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.764
How are the radishes?

25:04.764 --> 25:06.243
<i>Eileen,
I need your advice.</i>

25:06.243 --> 25:07.854
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

25:07.854 --> 25:10.509
I just left the farm, and
I know something's wrong there,

25:10.509 --> 25:13.381
but I'm not quite sure
what it is.

25:13.381 --> 25:15.862
<i>I want to talk it through
with you.</i>

25:15.862 --> 25:20.431
Sure. Uh, why don't you,
uh, pick me up?

25:20.431 --> 25:22.477
Really? Okay.
Your hotel?

25:22.477 --> 25:25.045
No, uh,
First Anchorage Hospital.

25:25.045 --> 25:26.829
<i>What? Why are you there?</i>

25:26.829 --> 25:30.441
Just pick me up.
Out front. Now.

25:30.441 --> 25:31.486
Okay.

25:43.193 --> 25:45.021
Hi, Stanley.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.022
<i>Where are you?</i>

25:46.022 --> 25:48.459
I'm just running
a few errands.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.549
<i>I talked to Aaron.</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:53.116
Well, I guess it's pretty clear
who can't keep a secret.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.292
He was worried.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.946
And so am I.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.600
I'm fine, Stanley.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.776
It doesn't sound to me
like you're fine.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.343
I'm so sorry, Stanley.
I gotta go.

26:02.343 --> 26:03.866
I'll check in
with you later.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.609
Thanks for picking me up.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.742
Are you okay?
Why were you at the hospital?

26:09.742 --> 26:11.439
Not important.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.223
So what do you want
to talk about?

26:13.223 --> 26:14.964
I did what you said.
I went to the farm,

26:14.964 --> 26:16.879
and you were right.
That's where the story is.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.533
I interviewed Erica,
and she told me her dad

26:18.533 --> 26:20.361
is acting very strange.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.624
Don't most kids think that
about their parents?

26:22.624 --> 26:24.800
Maybe, but it's just
the two of them,

26:24.800 --> 26:26.628
and he's become
very anti-tech.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.022
She said he's acting weird
and secretive.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.937
Did you see anything?
Hear anything?

26:30.937 --> 26:32.982
No. Erica let me into the barn

26:32.982 --> 26:34.375
that he usually keeps locked,

26:34.375 --> 26:38.205
but I looked around and--
Hold on.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.033
I just realized something.
They had fertilizer

26:40.033 --> 26:41.730
in the barn--
tons of it.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.253
So? It's a farm.
That makes sense.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.995
Not there. They only use organic
salmon fertilizer.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.344
That's their whole approach.

26:47.344 --> 26:48.955
Was there a lot of it?

26:48.955 --> 26:51.000
Yes, like three or four pallets.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.089
Okay, well, not to get ahead
of ourselves,

26:53.089 --> 26:56.571
but fertilizer
is ammonium nitrate.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.355
That's used to blow things up.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.665
Get to her.
Give her the permission

27:03.665 --> 27:04.884
she needs to tell you more.

27:04.884 --> 27:08.365
That's your job.
Got it?

27:08.365 --> 27:09.932
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.108
Do it.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.550
<i>Hello?</i>

27:19.550 --> 27:22.466
Erica, hi.
It's Gabriel.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.077
<i>I can't talk, Gabriel.</i>

27:24.077 --> 27:26.035
<i>My dad is really upset
you were in the barn.</i>

27:26.035 --> 27:28.081
I'm sorry, but I really need
to talk to you

27:28.081 --> 27:29.604
as soon as possible.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.955
<i>I can't. I'm sorry.
I have to go.</i>

27:32.955 --> 27:35.131
Wait, please.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.568
You have church
tomorrow morning, right?

27:37.568 --> 27:38.961
I'm going to come.
I'll see you there.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.007
<i>No, he'll be with me.</i>

27:41.007 --> 27:44.358
<i>- Erica?
- I'll be right there, Dad.</i>

27:44.358 --> 27:45.925
<i>I have to go. I'm sorry.</i>

27:45.925 --> 27:47.666
I'll be there.
At church. Tomorrow.

27:59.895 --> 28:02.898
Hey. How are you?

28:06.772 --> 28:09.818
- Hey, Dad. I'm just gonna go.
- Sure, okay.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.435
Hi.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.742
Thank you for meeting me.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.527
This is really hard for me.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.834
What is?

28:25.834 --> 28:30.230
Erica, this is your chance
to help your dad.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.843
You can talk to me.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.593
What is that?

28:45.593 --> 28:47.856
Some of the people
from the group my dad meets with

28:47.856 --> 28:48.944
gave it to him.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.294
He keeps it hidden
in his room.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.210
It's really messed up.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.169
I don't want my dad
to do something bad.

28:57.953 --> 28:59.650
Can I see it?

28:59.650 --> 29:01.304
Gabriel, he's all I have.

29:15.144 --> 29:16.493
This is insane.

29:16.493 --> 29:17.886
"There comes a time
when true Patriots

29:17.886 --> 29:20.367
must erase the mistakes
of the past and the present,

29:20.367 --> 29:24.153
and overthrow our economic
and technological systems

29:24.153 --> 29:26.199
by whatever means necessary."

29:26.199 --> 29:29.898
"That includes violence
if it furthers our purpose.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.944
Signed, Genesis."

29:31.944 --> 29:34.120
We did a story on these guys
about a year ago.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.122
I think it was Austin.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.733
Genesis is a legit
eco-terrorist group.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.126
Call Austin.
See what he knows.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.127
We have a story here.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.563
We got the pieces
of a story.

29:42.563 --> 29:43.999
We have a very unstable guy

29:43.999 --> 29:46.088
who's hoarding bomb-making
materials,

29:46.088 --> 29:48.961
and he's tied to a group of
crazies who advocate violence.

29:48.961 --> 29:51.267
We have a farmer
stockpiling fertilizer

29:51.267 --> 29:52.921
and exercising
his first amendment rights.

29:52.921 --> 29:55.358
- You're ignoring the facts.
- I'm stating the facts.

29:55.358 --> 29:57.883
There's something here,
but we're making some leaps.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.319
Stanley, come on.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.103
Go back and put it
to Block directly.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.279
Short of more facts, we need to
get him on the record

30:03.279 --> 30:05.891
confirming his intent
or his connection to Genesis.

30:05.891 --> 30:09.329
So we ask him if he's planning
to build a bomb?

30:09.329 --> 30:11.810
That's exactly what we do.
This is when it gets fun.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.420
That doesn't seem
like fun.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.943
It's a certain type of fun.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.902
- What else?
- We should make a call, Bob.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.251
I agree.

30:18.251 --> 30:19.339
Are you gonna tell the feds?

30:19.339 --> 30:21.210
Yes. We have to.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.559
Well, don't let them
piss on his story.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.823
Go.
Get a comment.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.175
Ready?

30:36.660 --> 30:38.227
Do you see him?

30:38.227 --> 30:39.794
No.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.150
There.

30:51.284 --> 30:54.069
All right. Look him in the eye.
Ask the questions.

30:54.069 --> 30:56.463
Don't let him go
till he answers.

30:56.463 --> 30:59.248
Right.

30:59.248 --> 31:01.250
Mr. Block?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.644
This is my colleague,
Eileen Fitzgerald.

31:03.644 --> 31:06.255
I don't want you talking
to Erica ever again.

31:06.255 --> 31:07.778
You've lost our trust.

31:07.778 --> 31:10.259
We don't want to talk to her.
We want to talk to you.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.175
Really?

31:13.175 --> 31:14.698
When I was in your barn,
I saw your stockpile

31:14.698 --> 31:16.700
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.354
So what?
It's a farm.

31:18.354 --> 31:21.357
Ammonia nitrate can also be used
to make a bomb.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.185
Am I being accused
of something here?

31:23.185 --> 31:25.100
Just asking a question.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.798
You're planning to build a bomb
with those materials?

31:27.798 --> 31:29.452
Why would I build a bomb?

31:29.452 --> 31:32.586
Are you a member of the
eco-terrorist group Genesis?

31:32.586 --> 31:34.327
Where'd you--
Where'd you get that?

31:34.327 --> 31:35.502
Can you answer
the question?

31:35.502 --> 31:37.199
Did you steal that
from my house?

31:37.199 --> 31:38.984
Okay, if so, I will have you
arrested right now.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.420
He didn't steal it.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.464
Then how did he get it?

31:41.464 --> 31:43.902
I gave it to them, Dad.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.122
What?
Why would you do that?

31:47.122 --> 31:49.908
'Cause I don't wanna lose you,
and I feel like I already have.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.605
N-No. No, come on.

31:51.605 --> 31:52.954
Never. I-- I'm--

31:52.954 --> 31:54.825
She's scared, Mr. Block.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.871
She's worried about
your involvement with Genesis.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.786
Okay, don't tell me
about my daughter.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.614
She's all I have left.

32:00.614 --> 32:03.704
Okay? I don't want her
to grow up in a world like this.

32:03.704 --> 32:07.882
She needs to be protected.
That's what I'm trying to do.

32:07.882 --> 32:09.275
I'm not a terrorist.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.842
You are if you blow things up
to make your point.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.932
Okay. We gotta go.

32:15.890 --> 32:16.935
I'll be in the car.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.896
Erica, I'm sorry.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.463
Are you okay?

32:23.463 --> 32:25.291
Yeah.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.509
You wanna come with us?

32:26.509 --> 32:28.250
No, I need to go
be with my dad.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.600
I need to go help him.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.038
He's a good man.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.865
Thank you.

32:34.865 --> 32:37.085
Ted, I'm here with Bob Young.

32:37.085 --> 32:38.347
<i>Good to meet you, Bob.</i>

32:38.347 --> 32:39.827
Uh, same here,
Agent Creighton.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.482
One of my reporters came across
a large amount

32:42.482 --> 32:47.443
of ammonium nitrate at
an organic farm in the Valley.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.271
<i>Any reason to believe
it isn't being stored</i>

32:49.271 --> 32:50.446
<i>for its intended purpose?</i>

32:50.446 --> 32:52.492
The farmer appears
to be affiliated

32:52.492 --> 32:55.625
with an eco-terrorist group
called Genesis.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.324
- Are you aware of them? <i>
- We are.</i>

32:58.324 --> 32:59.760
<i>How'd you get on
to this guy?</i>

32:59.760 --> 33:02.502
Well, his farm, uh,
won the contest

33:02.502 --> 33:05.461
for the biggest cabbage
at the State Fair.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.507
<i>And his connection
to this Genesis group?</i>

33:07.507 --> 33:10.945
He was in possession
of an anti-tech manifesto

33:10.945 --> 33:12.425
published by them.

33:12.425 --> 33:15.341
It clearly supported
the use of violence.

33:15.341 --> 33:18.605
<i>Does the guy have a name?</i>

33:18.605 --> 33:22.348
Brandon Block.
Does that ring a bell?

33:22.348 --> 33:24.263
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

33:24.263 --> 33:25.525
<i>B-L-O-C-K?</i>

33:25.525 --> 33:27.048
Correct.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.310
<i>Where's the farm?</i>

33:28.310 --> 33:30.834
Ted, we are considering
running a story

33:30.834 --> 33:35.404
on Block
and his connection to Genesis.

33:35.404 --> 33:38.059
If this guy blows something up
and people die,

33:38.059 --> 33:39.582
we don't wanna wear that.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.976
<i>Sure, but hypothetically,
if we were aware</i>

33:41.976 --> 33:44.457
<i>that someone was planning
an attack in Alaska,</i>

33:44.457 --> 33:47.416
<i>we would make an arrest well
before the planned event.</i>

33:47.416 --> 33:49.810
Gotcha.

33:49.810 --> 33:51.377
Okay, Ted.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.814
I'll be in touch.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.381
You think an attack
is imminent?

33:55.381 --> 33:57.470
Hard to tell,
but something is cooking.

33:59.776 --> 34:00.864
What'd you get?

34:00.864 --> 34:02.301
He's unhinged.

34:02.301 --> 34:04.912
He's not a mastermind,
but he's a foot soldier.

34:04.912 --> 34:08.263
Did he tell you he's using
the fertilizer to build a bomb?

34:08.263 --> 34:10.526
Most terrorists don't disclose
that information, Bob.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.180
They're funny that way.

34:12.180 --> 34:14.487
- If he didn't confirm it--
- We have enough, Stanley.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.663
- This is a good story.
- It's not enough to publish.

34:16.663 --> 34:19.492
- You're wrong.
- I agree.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.450
- Noted.
- We have a manifesto.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.931
He has a First Amendment
right to read whatever.

34:23.931 --> 34:26.281
Did you cave to the FBI?

34:26.281 --> 34:28.283
I don't appreciate
the accusation.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.546
- And you're wrong.
- We are close.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.983
You uncovered something
the FBI didn't even have.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.724
That is meaningful.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.336
But I'm sorry,
we are short here.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.120
This story is not ready
to publish.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.557
- We're not done.
- Good.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.560
Come on, Gabriel.

34:46.519 --> 34:49.304
You pissed off?

34:49.304 --> 34:50.523
Yeah. I kind of am.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.394
Good. Use that.
Make 'em pay.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.353
- Make who pay?
- Everyone.

34:54.353 --> 34:56.311
Anyone who stands between you
and telling your stories.

34:56.311 --> 34:57.791
You know what I mean.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.140
I think I do.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.620
Eileen Fitzgerald.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.448
<i>This is Oren Conners.</i>

35:02.448 --> 35:04.841
Chief Conners.
Thank you for calling.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.669
Stay mad.

35:06.669 --> 35:08.149
We've been looking for you.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.933
<i>I read your article
about Durkin.</i>

35:09.933 --> 35:11.631
Yeah, what'd you think?

35:11.631 --> 35:13.633
<i>I think I have something
for you.</i>

35:13.633 --> 35:16.462
<i>Can you meet me at
the River Grill, 5:00 p.m.?</i>

35:16.462 --> 35:18.072
I sure can.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.476
You leaving?

35:30.476 --> 35:32.739
Yeah, I am.

35:32.739 --> 35:36.046
Got time for a beer at,
uh, Beard?

35:36.046 --> 35:37.483
You don't drink.

35:37.483 --> 35:38.788
You do.

35:38.788 --> 35:41.139
And my bet is, you could
use one right about now.

35:44.577 --> 35:47.493
I want you to know that the fact
that we aren't publishing

35:47.493 --> 35:49.234
is not a reflection
of your work,

35:49.234 --> 35:52.933
but a reflection of the bar
we set as journalists.

35:52.933 --> 35:56.154
I understand that,
in theory.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.720
But in practice, it sucks.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.723
- Mm-hmm.
- I get it.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.812
But publishing a story
that's not there

36:02.812 --> 36:04.597
can do a lot more harm
than good.

36:07.077 --> 36:10.864
You should know that the FBI
didn't have Brandon Block

36:10.864 --> 36:13.562
on their radar.
They do now.

36:13.562 --> 36:16.217
- They told you that?
- They did.

36:16.217 --> 36:19.568
I just spoke to my contact
there again.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.004
This is how Genesis works--

36:21.004 --> 36:23.964
they target damaged people,
they groom them,

36:23.964 --> 36:28.621
and, ultimately,
they radicalize them.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.013
It sounds like Brandon Block

36:30.013 --> 36:32.581
was about to do something
very stupid,

36:32.581 --> 36:34.757
and you may have
prevented that.

36:34.757 --> 36:37.978
And by sharing that information
with the FBI,

36:37.978 --> 36:39.675
you may have helped
save lives.

36:39.675 --> 36:42.330
So, Gabriel...

36:45.290 --> 36:47.683
Welcome to the newsroom.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.207
You mean...

36:49.207 --> 36:50.643
Be it a blessing
or a curse,

36:50.643 --> 36:53.863
you are now a reporter
for <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

36:53.863 --> 36:56.126
Are you serious?

36:56.126 --> 37:00.914
In addition to your
current duties.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.525
And I can't give you
a financial bump right away.

37:03.525 --> 37:06.311
I understand.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.921
Thank you...

37:07.921 --> 37:09.575
very much.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.364
He's inside.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.540
- Did you bump your head?
- I did.

37:18.540 --> 37:21.326
On the ground.

37:21.326 --> 37:22.979
Big night?

37:22.979 --> 37:25.547
Isn't every night
in Alaska a big night?

37:26.635 --> 37:29.769
No, I was drinking
all the time back then.

37:29.769 --> 37:33.338
Wrapped a cruiser
around a light pole.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.557
I had zero credibility.

37:35.557 --> 37:39.126
So, are you saying you guys
made headway on Gloria's case?

37:39.126 --> 37:43.043
Durkin did.
He was my lead investigator.

37:43.043 --> 37:47.308
But as you guys reported, he
didn't want to pursue any leads.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.441
But you were the chief.
Why didn't you push him?

37:49.441 --> 37:50.920
I was a drunk.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.706
I had no leverage.

37:53.706 --> 37:57.536
Durkin was after my job,
and he got it.

37:57.536 --> 38:01.670
Reading your article
brought it all back.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.846
Shook me up.

38:03.846 --> 38:07.459
Grateful for that.

38:07.459 --> 38:10.940
Look, understand,
whoever killed Gloria

38:10.940 --> 38:15.075
is sure
that he will never be found.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.730
You have advantage.

38:17.730 --> 38:19.471
What kind of advantage?

38:36.879 --> 38:39.621
Thank you.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.362
Yeah.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.585
Is this what I think it is?

38:46.585 --> 38:48.456
The un-redacted police report.

38:48.456 --> 38:52.504
Look, here's two names--
Ezra Fisher and Rega Horne.

38:52.504 --> 38:55.202
Durkin had two persons
of interest.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.464
Durkin doesn't matter anymore.

38:56.464 --> 38:57.987
These guys do.

39:02.992 --> 39:06.300
Well, you got your wish--
working on the weekend.

39:06.300 --> 39:11.000
Barely. It's Sunday night.
That's almost Monday.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.654
Where should I drop you?

39:12.654 --> 39:14.700
Hotel bar is fine.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.224
So how'd the tournament go?

39:17.224 --> 39:19.444
Good. We won.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.793
Well, that doesn't
surprise me.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.710
Is this you being nice?

39:26.015 --> 39:27.060
Should we go?

39:28.888 --> 39:31.891
