00:29.541 --> 00:31.750
Islam means...

00:31.833 --> 00:34.666
living in submission.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.875
To be a Muslim

00:36.958 --> 00:40.541
is to live in submission
to the will of God.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.500
It is to cut bonds to
all the men we followed

00:44.458 --> 00:46.083
in our lives.

00:46.166 --> 00:47.666
Our leaders.

00:48.541 --> 00:49.833
Our coaches.

00:50.541 --> 00:53.041
Our fathers.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.708
Your ancestors
were slaves to men.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.458
From this day on...

01:00.291 --> 01:03.958
you are a slave to God.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.250
Brother Lewis,
please come up.

01:12.708 --> 01:14.000
This brother

01:14.083 --> 01:17.083
has decided to open
his heart to Islam.

01:17.166 --> 01:19.458
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:23.791 --> 01:25.458
If you're prepared...

01:26.625 --> 01:28.333
to walk the straight path,

01:28.416 --> 01:30.166
say the words with me.

01:46.125 --> 01:50.000
<i>- Amen. As-salaamu alaykum.</i>
<i>- Wa alaykumu salaam.</i>

01:50.083 --> 01:52.791
The world will be
looking to you, brother.

01:54.041 --> 01:55.625
More than most.

01:55.708 --> 01:58.041
Who will you be to them?

01:58.125 --> 02:00.625
Lewis Alcindor, Jr.

02:00.708 --> 02:03.208
What is your name?

02:05.875 --> 02:08.916
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

02:11.125 --> 02:13.958
("My Favorite Mutiny"
by The Coup playing

03:47.750 --> 03:50.208
Oh shit. You got
your game face on.

03:50.291 --> 03:51.416
Just my face, Maurice.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.875
It's scary nonetheless.

03:52.958 --> 03:54.416
What's the word
on Cowboy Clifton?

03:54.500 --> 03:57.041
I got my eyes peeled.
Man, I hate scalpers.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.958
I see that motherfucker,
I'ma give him a ass-whooping

03:59.041 --> 04:01.958
- of a lifetime.
- Give him these instead.
That's a thousand tickets.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.416
Tell him there's more
where that came from,

04:03.500 --> 04:05.583
and he can spread the word.
Can't have this place

04:05.666 --> 04:07.541
looking like a ghost town
on national TV.

04:07.625 --> 04:08.750
So, I can't fuck him up?

04:08.833 --> 04:10.750
Wait until he gets those
asses in those seats.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.625
- Okay.
- Buss made some
changes to the VIPs.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.625
Of course, he did.

04:14.708 --> 04:16.291
No way we're getting
Dionne Warwick.

04:16.375 --> 04:19.666
- You can always
say a little prayer.
- Is that a new awning?

04:19.750 --> 04:21.541
He said it wasn't red enough.

04:23.416 --> 04:25.916
No. No. Berenice, no!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.750
No more of this Can-Can crap!
Come on!

04:28.833 --> 04:30.916
This is seductive!
It's all legs!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.250
No, it's all stiff!
I want freedom!

04:33.333 --> 04:34.958
I want sex!

04:35.041 --> 04:37.041
I want them calling
the Catholic League of Decency!

04:37.125 --> 04:40.291
I think what you want
is a striptease.

04:40.375 --> 04:43.000
Well, maybe if they just moved
their hips a little, you know,

04:43.083 --> 04:45.875
- or work their hair?
- Exactly! How are
they gonna work the hair

04:45.958 --> 04:47.375
with these buns
in there? Come on!

04:47.458 --> 04:50.958
It's not ballet.
It's disco, Bernice!
Come on, girls.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.833
It's this here!
Sex, you know?

04:52.916 --> 04:54.666
It's women! It's their sex!

04:54.750 --> 04:56.166
It's not just their legs!
Come on, girls.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.541
Move it! Move your sex!

04:57.625 --> 04:59.125
Good, like this girl here!
Like this tan girl!

04:59.208 --> 05:02.166
There we go! Those are
the moves we're looking for!

05:02.250 --> 05:03.666
Right there, right, Jeanie?

05:03.750 --> 05:06.708
Let her choreograph it then.

05:06.791 --> 05:08.625
- We're done!

05:11.041 --> 05:13.166
Wow. Bernice?

05:14.375 --> 05:16.458
You're done? Okay.

05:17.541 --> 05:19.708
They're wrong anyway.

05:19.791 --> 05:21.208
We need to talk.

05:21.291 --> 05:23.791
Great idea, Claire.
You're just a girl I wanna see.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.041
I had a wiener from
the cart for lunch,

05:26.125 --> 05:28.375
and it was... sloppy.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.541
- Heard oysters help with that.
- I'm being serious.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.333
It was the casing.
When you bite into it,
it's gotta snap.

05:34.416 --> 05:35.958
I know the feeling.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.083
We're going to need you
to take a step back.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.375
God is in the details, Claire.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.875
That was our
second choreographer.

05:41.958 --> 05:43.416
You've sent back
all the uniforms.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.416
Because they stunk.
And if they stink, we stink.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.583
- Only if we open!
- What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

05:48.666 --> 05:50.375
Apparently, our sound system

05:50.458 --> 05:51.958
wasn't up to your
high standards.

05:52.041 --> 05:53.416
Claire,
what the hell is this?

05:53.500 --> 05:56.458
My guy said these speakers
are supposed to be up already!

05:56.541 --> 05:58.083
Same system as
Club Fantasia!

05:58.166 --> 06:00.541
That's not the system
we permitted with the city.

06:00.625 --> 06:01.916
Well, get a new permit!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
In process,
as of this morning.

06:04.083 --> 06:06.333
- We'll have it in
a week or two.
- A week or two?

06:06.416 --> 06:08.958
Claire, you have got to put
some pepper on the ball.

06:09.041 --> 06:10.666
That is pepper on the ball.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.416
But, I don't suppose your
Fantasia friend mentioned that

06:13.500 --> 06:15.791
before you ripped out
our entire sound system

06:15.875 --> 06:18.333
because that's not his job
or yours. It's mine.

06:18.416 --> 06:19.958
Claire, I'm not
opening this place

06:20.041 --> 06:22.750
unless we're 110% ready.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.916
You only get one chance
at a first impression.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.791
That's why it's called
a first impression.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.125
W-w-what is this?

06:28.208 --> 06:29.416
Claire, come on.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.625
This little door thing
should be flush with the bar.

06:31.708 --> 06:32.958
Flush with the bar! Come on.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.083
Let's care about stuff.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.041
No more kinks!
Let's care about it!

06:36.125 --> 06:37.791
Let's be perfect!

06:37.875 --> 06:40.916
Jerry! We need to talk!

06:41.000 --> 06:44.333
- Hello?! We need to talk!
- Hey, Frank.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.083
Here we go.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.083
I'll find another dance troupe.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.125
And I'll...
find another cigarette.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.166
You yelling at me in
front of everybody? What?

06:56.250 --> 06:59.083
- I gotta hear about this
from your mother?
- That's our bookkeeper.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.625
She's a goddamn good one, too.
She found us a solution.

07:01.708 --> 07:04.666
Excellent solution.
Give away the team?

07:04.750 --> 07:07.125
To Joanne. It stays in
the family. Did you read it?

07:07.208 --> 07:09.291
- She hates your guts.
- So what?

07:09.375 --> 07:10.666
She loves me more.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.208
Just like you, Frankie.
I was going to tell you.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.666
- When, at my fuckin' funeral?
- I forgot!

07:15.750 --> 07:17.458
- You forgot?!
- Frank,

07:17.541 --> 07:19.250
look what we have!

07:19.333 --> 07:21.333
Look what we did! Look at it!

07:21.416 --> 07:22.500
The team we got!

07:22.583 --> 07:24.500
We're Roman emperors!

07:24.583 --> 07:26.291
Yeah, okay.
You're a Roman emperor.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.958
Well, I got news for you.
Rome is fucking ruins,

07:29.041 --> 07:32.833
and I don't think you're going
to be happy until we are, too!

07:32.916 --> 07:35.291
I don't know, Jerry!
Maybe that will do it for you

07:35.375 --> 07:37.750
because clearly
nothing else does!

07:37.833 --> 07:40.250
Not the buildings,
not the broads,

07:40.333 --> 07:41.625
n-not the friendship!

07:41.708 --> 07:44.750
And pretty soon, it's gonna be
the same thing over there!

07:48.958 --> 07:50.166
We're done.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.833
We're done?

07:52.833 --> 07:55.041
We're partners!

07:55.125 --> 07:57.708
We're gettin' a divorce.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.166
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

08:08.250 --> 08:10.291

08:20.916 --> 08:22.166
Ow.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.083
Happy first day.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.208
You might actually enjoy it

08:57.291 --> 08:59.458
if you put the paper down
and look out the window.

08:59.541 --> 09:01.875
Can't turn the world off
just to have a pleasant morning.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.458
Well, can you
drink your juice first?

09:08.375 --> 09:10.333
Tom called.

09:10.416 --> 09:14.416
He says with this recession,
my portfolio is down.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.500
It would be unwise
for me to turn down

09:16.583 --> 09:17.708
an extended contract.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.791
Well, maybe it would be wise

09:19.875 --> 09:21.958
for you to quit tomorrow,

09:22.041 --> 09:24.708
and we run away and bum it
to an ashram somewhere.

09:26.958 --> 09:29.708
I was hoping one more year
would be enough.

09:29.791 --> 09:32.541
Well, who knows?
Maybe it'll be a good one.

09:34.958 --> 09:38.750
You know, if nothing changes,
nothing changes.

09:48.583 --> 09:51.291
<i>Lewis Alcindor, Jr., of</i>
<i>Power Memorial High school</i>

09:51.375 --> 09:53.666
<i>with an epic showing</i>
<i>here tonight.</i>

09:53.750 --> 09:56.208
<i>An extraordinary young man.</i>

09:57.250 --> 09:59.500
<i>Alcindor leading</i>
<i>Wooden's Bruins</i>

09:59.583 --> 10:03.041
<i>to a third consecutive</i>

<i>and lossless season.</i>

<i>Young Lewis Alcindor,</i>

10:06.041 --> 10:07.708
<i>now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,</i>

10:07.791 --> 10:12.458
<i>in his first season</i>
<i>after leading the Bucks</i>
<i>to a world championship.</i>

10:41.208 --> 10:42.458
Get past.

10:42.541 --> 10:43.833
Whoo!

10:44.500 --> 10:46.208
You're in early.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.875
Bouncin' off the walls.
Figured I'd come here

10:47.958 --> 10:49.416
and get some work done.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.500
Oscar used to do the same thing
when we were in Milwaukee.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.750
- The Big O?
- Day one as an assistant,

10:54.833 --> 10:56.666
I made it my mission

10:56.750 --> 10:58.166
to be the first to practice,

10:58.250 --> 11:01.166
and I think Oscar made it
his mission to beat me.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.000
- So, as the season went on,

11:03.083 --> 11:05.166
I showed up earlier and earlier,

11:05.250 --> 11:07.916
he'd be there every damn time,
dripping sweat.

11:09.791 --> 11:12.041
You know it's on now,
right, Coach?

11:12.833 --> 11:14.083
About time.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.875
What's wrong, Coach?
You ain't happy?

11:17.958 --> 11:20.041
You tell me.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.916
I wonder how you think
you've been performing.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.166
Well, it's kind of hard to say

11:23.250 --> 11:25.291
since we ain't played
a game yet, but...

11:25.375 --> 11:29.041
shot coming around,
feeling relaxed in the break.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.708
Why? What you feelin'?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.125
Disappointment.
When I came in,

11:33.208 --> 11:35.666
I thought you'd take charge.

11:35.750 --> 11:36.875
I thought you'd direct the show.

11:36.958 --> 11:38.333
Ain't that what I been doin'?

11:38.416 --> 11:40.041
I mean, me and Norm.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.708
You the one who
put us together--

11:41.791 --> 11:43.750
I'm not talking
about a point guard.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.000
I'm talking about
a captain of the ship.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.083
Right now,
when I look out,

11:47.166 --> 11:49.541
I see four guys
rowing together,

11:49.625 --> 11:51.833
and one big anchor left behind.

11:51.916 --> 11:54.500
<i>Well, yeah, but Kareem</i>
<i>the captain.</i>

11:54.583 --> 11:56.708
I can't go around as
a rookie, telling--

11:56.791 --> 11:58.416
Somebody's got to.

11:59.541 --> 12:02.208
You know, just at
the last practice...

12:03.541 --> 12:05.291
Kareem came up to me,

12:05.375 --> 12:08.541
the end of practice,
and he said, um...

12:08.625 --> 12:10.583
"When is that young buck
going to take over?"

12:10.666 --> 12:12.458
For real?

12:12.541 --> 12:13.541
Cap said that?

12:13.625 --> 12:15.375
Unless you think
I should go to Norm.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.458
Nah! Hell no, Coach! No, no.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.458
I can't let the big fella down.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.250
- I got you.
- I thought you might.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.500
Go on. I'll rebound.

12:31.708 --> 12:34.625
Come on, Cap! Run!
Run with the play!

12:36.000 --> 12:37.708
Kareem looks like
a fuckin' tree trunk!

12:37.791 --> 12:40.208
- I know. Keep it moving!
- Move your feet!

12:40.291 --> 12:42.125
Come on, Magic!
Show 'em how it's done!

12:42.208 --> 12:44.208
Hey, Cooper!
Stay in the corner!

12:44.291 --> 12:46.333
I'm coming to you, Cap!
Go to the basket, big man!

12:46.416 --> 12:47.833
- Move your feet!
- Throw me the fuckin' ball.

12:47.916 --> 12:49.750
This one's for you! Go get it!

12:59.875 --> 13:01.958
Thought you saw
me there, big fella.

13:02.041 --> 13:03.791
Look, if you hit a spin
and rolled to the basket--

13:03.875 --> 13:05.291
You can meet me where I'm at.

13:05.375 --> 13:06.375
Yeah, but I'm
trying to get you

13:06.458 --> 13:07.666
on the floor of
the offense, baby!

13:07.750 --> 13:09.458
- Yeah, that sucked.
- Do you want me to, uh,

13:09.541 --> 13:11.916
I can run a mini-clinic with
Kareem, zero in on his footwork.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.291
- Call it!
Bring it in, guys.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.708
Alright, we've all seen enough
of these last few weeks

13:17.791 --> 13:21.166
to know that if we play our game
and stick to the system,

13:22.125 --> 13:23.750
nobody can beat us.

13:24.375 --> 13:25.625
Just ourselves.

13:28.625 --> 13:31.083
- Team on three!
- Let's go.

13:31.166 --> 13:33.500
- One, two, three, team!
- Team!

13:33.583 --> 13:35.333
Hey, Cap, hold up.

13:35.416 --> 13:36.875
Come on, man,
give me 15 minutes.

13:36.958 --> 13:38.416
Practice is over, Houdini.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.125
- Boys.
- I need good news.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.083
It's trout season.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.541
But I got somethin' better
for you in the meantime.

13:49.625 --> 13:52.083
I spoke to
Spencer Haywood's agent.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.375
He's available,
and he's motivated.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.458
And humbled?

13:56.541 --> 13:58.250
I need a role player,
not a star.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.083
What fucking choice
does he have in the matter?

14:00.166 --> 14:01.250
That ship sailed
four teams ago.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.666
He knows it. Team knows it.
League knows it.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.208
He's ready to roll up
his sleeves,

14:05.291 --> 14:07.083
bang, bruise,
do the dirty work,

14:07.166 --> 14:08.541
whatever it takes,
whatever you need.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.000
Just so long as it
gets him one of these.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.708
Well, we could use a lot more
of that attitude around here.

14:12.791 --> 14:15.916
- Yeah, I saw that.
- Jerry, what the hell
do I do about Kareem?

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
- It's a brick wall.
- Well, don't offer
him any pork.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.583
How soon can we get Haywood?

14:20.666 --> 14:22.250
I think we can get this done.
He's ready to move.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.708
Hey, Jerry. Hi, Jerry.

14:23.791 --> 14:25.208
- Hey, Paul.

14:25.291 --> 14:28.208
You're doing a great job
as assistant coach.

14:28.291 --> 14:29.708
I'm really trying my best.

14:29.791 --> 14:32.125
Well, I recognize that.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.791
And I appreciate all
of your efforts.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.541
Thanks.

14:42.958 --> 14:45.000
- Bus is waiting.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.125
Yeah, what's he need?

14:47.208 --> 14:49.583
No, the one with the wheels.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.083
Oh.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.041
- Right.
- Brought you a little something.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.041
I thought you might
wanna decorate.

14:56.791 --> 14:58.416
- San Juan.
- Yeah.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.333
It's the chicken wire game.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.166
That was one angry mob.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.791
I think that chicken wire
might have saved our lives.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.208
Well, they're
a passionate people.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.000
I guess I figured as far
as opening nights go...

15:14.125 --> 15:16.083
can't get any worse.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.541
Not unless we lose
to the Clippers.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.500
Fuck it.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.500
Let's go play some basketball.

15:23.708 --> 15:25.500
Fuck it.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.250
<i> Coming up,</i>
<i>the Los Angeles Lakers</i>

15:32.333 --> 15:33.958
<i>take on</i>
<i>the San Diego Clippers</i>

15:34.041 --> 15:35.833
<i>with announcers</i>
<i>Brent Musburger...</i>

15:35.916 --> 15:38.833
Fucking amateur hour!
Those network nitwits

15:38.916 --> 15:42.500
wouldn't know a decent
announcer from a Ken doll.

15:42.583 --> 15:43.958
Hey, fuck 'em, right?

15:44.041 --> 15:47.333
- I say we beat 'em
at their own game.
- Yeah.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.291
Hey, I don't know
if you had a chance

15:49.375 --> 15:50.916
to check out the tape
I cut together.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.333
You know, the one
I did from training camp?

15:53.416 --> 15:55.000
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know, tips from a pro.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.958
Huh? I think we could
call it "Pat's Pointers."

15:58.041 --> 16:01.125
<i>Presenting "Pat's Pointers</i>
<i>with Pat Riley."</i>

16:01.208 --> 16:03.333
<i>Brought to you by</i>
<i>AD Plumbing and Associates.</i>

16:03.416 --> 16:05.916
<i>I mean, we could call it</i>
<i>"Chick's Checklist" or--</i>

16:06.000 --> 16:07.708
Patrick, do you
see what this is?

16:09.166 --> 16:11.208
- Yeah, your hand.
- That's my fist.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.583
When I close it while
we're on the air,

16:13.666 --> 16:14.750
you close your mouth.

16:14.833 --> 16:17.750
That's the most important
skill in this job.

16:17.833 --> 16:20.833
That's you talking.
That's you shutting up.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.375
<i>Comprende?</i>

16:23.458 --> 16:27.208
Right, but when I am talking,
right? When I do talk,

16:27.291 --> 16:29.541
you want it from,
like, an insider,

16:29.625 --> 16:31.791
ex-player
point of view, right?

16:31.875 --> 16:33.041
I'm fisting you, Pat.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.583
Now, pay attention.
There's a rhythm to it.

16:35.666 --> 16:38.750
See? I call, you color.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.625
Like a paintbrush,
with your tongue.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.500
After a while, it'll be, uh,
like second nature to you.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.375
You won't even have to look.

16:46.625 --> 16:48.166
You'll feel it when
you're getting fisted.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.958
- Oh, I'm feeling it already.

17:01.833 --> 17:04.833
- Come on, Patricia.
We're walking.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.333
Fuck it.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.291
Hey, Midnight.
Got your strings out.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.708
Oh no, man, these are
my good luck charms.

17:15.791 --> 17:17.250
Been doing this forever.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.208
Yeah? You do it last year
when you blew your knee out?

17:19.291 --> 17:22.541
Come on, man. Don't fuck
with a man's superstition.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.333
For me, it was my lucky jock.
Back in Cleveland,

17:25.416 --> 17:27.041
wore it all through
the playoffs,

17:27.125 --> 17:28.625
all through the finals.

17:28.708 --> 17:30.125
Right until I broke
my foot in half!

17:30.208 --> 17:32.041
- Shit, Chones!

17:32.125 --> 17:35.500
- Go on, take it for a spin!
See what it fit like.
- That's fucked up, man.

17:35.583 --> 17:36.958
That's disgusting, Chones.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.583
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

17:41.666 --> 17:43.583
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

17:43.666 --> 17:46.833
- Hey! It's EJ the DJ,
coming to you live

17:46.916 --> 17:49.250
and direct from game one.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.541
With a beat
to get you pumped.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.875
Okay! Okay!

17:54.958 --> 17:57.041
Hey, don't worry.
I'm gonna be ready.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.416
I'm gonna be ready.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.125
What's up, Cap?

18:01.208 --> 18:02.916
Just need some
orange juice now, right?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.250
Fresh squeezed.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.958
Hey, don't tell me
this the place!

18:09.041 --> 18:11.875
About to get up in these
Clippers' ass!

18:11.958 --> 18:14.833
I thought you had to be
good-looking out in California.

18:14.916 --> 18:16.500
Who let your ugly ass in?

18:16.583 --> 18:19.166
- Wood!
- You know it.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.333
Hey!<i> As-salaam alaykum,</i>
brother!

18:24.416 --> 18:26.333
<i>- Spencer Haywood.</i>

18:26.416 --> 18:28.583
<i>It's a pleasure.</i>
<i>You may never heard of me,</i>

18:28.666 --> 18:30.166
<i>but you've heard</i>
<i>of Kobe Bryant,</i>

18:30.250 --> 18:31.291
<i>and LeBron James?</i>

18:31.375 --> 18:33.916
<i>Straight out of high school</i>
<i>to the pros?</i>

18:34.000 --> 18:35.625
<i>That never would've</i>
<i>happened without me.</i>

18:35.708 --> 18:37.041
<i>See, I'm the man</i>
<i>who sued the league</i>

18:37.125 --> 18:38.791
<i>just for the right</i>
<i>to play ball</i>

18:38.875 --> 18:41.875
<i>and support my family</i>
<i>without four years of college.</i>

18:41.958 --> 18:43.875
<i>Now, that didn't make</i>
<i>the owners all too happy,</i>

18:43.958 --> 18:46.083
<i>so now I bounced around</i>
<i>a little in my time.</i>

18:48.791 --> 18:50.708
<i>But here I am,</i>
<i>my day in the sun.</i>

18:50.791 --> 18:51.916
<i>You made it out alive?</i>

18:52.000 --> 18:53.458
And it was a close call, man.
Shit,

18:53.541 --> 18:56.875
I was about to be the only
Black man in Salt Lake City.

18:56.958 --> 18:59.000
Tell me,
what motherfucker

18:59.083 --> 19:01.000
take a team called "Jazz"

19:01.083 --> 19:02.166
to Utah?!

19:02.250 --> 19:03.875
Better not tell Miles.

19:03.958 --> 19:05.791
Shit, man.
Where my locker at?

19:05.875 --> 19:08.833
Have you ever seen
Cap hug somebody?

19:08.916 --> 19:11.916
- I saw him put Bruce Lee
in a sleeper hold.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.166
- You know what they say
about Wood, right?
- What?

19:17.250 --> 19:18.333
Word on the street,

19:18.416 --> 19:20.833
dude cut the skin
off his own dick.

19:20.916 --> 19:22.750
- Ooh!
- I heard that, too.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.958
Circumcised his own self
with a rock and a razor.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.291
Oh, hell no.
That don't even sound real.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.916
I'd hate to be competing
with him for minutes.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.333
- That would be you.
- Good luck with that.

19:35.583 --> 19:37.250
Nah. Nah.

19:37.333 --> 19:40.083
Nah, that can't be true. Can it?

19:40.166 --> 19:41.541
Believe it.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.166
Fuck. Just got
some minutes, too.

19:48.125 --> 19:51.208
- Got a minute, Cap?

19:53.625 --> 19:55.750
Look like I'm goin' someplace?

19:57.166 --> 20:00.166
Well, cool!
Big night tonight.

20:00.250 --> 20:03.666
Can't wait!
We 'bout to put it on.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.875
It's a game. We'll play.

20:05.958 --> 20:08.541
Yes, sir!
Yes, we will.

20:08.625 --> 20:12.625
So, um, wonder how you feel
the team been performing.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.083
It is what it is.

20:17.958 --> 20:20.958
Yeah. Yeah, good point.

20:21.041 --> 20:24.083
See, I wasn't too sure about
the plan in the beginning.

20:24.166 --> 20:28.625
Coach McKinney,
all them birds and bees.

20:28.708 --> 20:31.333
Everybody wants to reinvent
the game of basketball.

20:31.416 --> 20:32.791
Sure!

20:32.875 --> 20:36.541
But, you know, since we've
been running it in practice,

20:36.625 --> 20:38.708
I think we gettin' a sight
of what it could be.

20:38.791 --> 20:40.541
Me and the other guys.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.458
But the biggest thing I see

20:43.541 --> 20:45.875
is you and me.

20:47.666 --> 20:49.000
Is that right?

20:49.083 --> 20:51.750
Hell yeah! Long as
I've been watching,

20:51.833 --> 20:54.500
you've been working
hard for every basket,

20:54.583 --> 20:56.333
double, tripled
in the post.

20:56.416 --> 20:58.791
But we get out and run
like McKinney say?

20:58.875 --> 21:02.000
Man, my size, my skill?

21:02.083 --> 21:03.333
I can get you the ball in ways

21:03.416 --> 21:05.458
you ain't never got
the ball before.

21:05.541 --> 21:08.583
Put another 10 points
on your average, easy.

21:08.666 --> 21:11.666
Plus we be whooping
everybody, dig?

21:13.208 --> 21:15.083
You got a lot of ideas,
young fella.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.208
Ideas be talk, Cap.
This some shit I know!

21:18.291 --> 21:21.625
Way I can move the rock?
What you can do with it?

21:22.500 --> 21:23.458
Man.

21:23.541 --> 21:25.125
Us together?

21:25.208 --> 21:26.958
That could be the thing to see.

21:27.041 --> 21:29.916
Cap and Buck.
Magic and Kareem.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.583
- (siren blaring

21:32.666 --> 21:34.708
Oh, oh! Kareem and Magic.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.291
Ain't never been
a combo like it!

21:40.375 --> 21:43.250
All-all we gotta do
is both show up.

21:48.458 --> 21:50.958
You two have fun.

21:55.083 --> 21:59.166
- How many games have you played?
- Since I was a pup.

22:01.916 --> 22:04.500
Yet never once

22:04.583 --> 22:06.291
as a professional.

22:07.083 --> 22:08.625
Tonight...

22:08.708 --> 22:12.083
will be my 853rd game.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.041
In this league.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.416
In that time,
I've won...

22:17.500 --> 22:19.958
five MVPs

22:20.041 --> 22:22.708
and a world
championship.

22:22.791 --> 22:25.666
And that's not counting
college titles-- where

22:25.750 --> 22:28.500
I assume your hubris

22:28.583 --> 22:30.166
comes from--

22:32.000 --> 22:34.125
winning one.

22:34.208 --> 22:37.375
Since you don't strike me
as much of a historian,

22:37.458 --> 22:39.875
I'll have you know

22:39.958 --> 22:41.750
I won three.

22:41.833 --> 22:44.291
And I would have
an Olympic gold.

22:44.375 --> 22:47.583
<i>As long as Black people in this</i>
<i>country continue to catch hell,</i>

22:47.666 --> 22:49.833
<i>I will not be representing</i>
<i>the United States</i>

22:49.916 --> 22:51.750
<i>at the Olympics.</i>

22:51.833 --> 22:54.750
But, there are more
important things in this life.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.625
Enjoy game one.

23:04.458 --> 23:07.500
Lakers! Lakers! Lakers!

23:07.583 --> 23:11.000
- Lakers! Lakers! Lakers! Lakers!

23:11.083 --> 23:13.166
First game! Let's go.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.166
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

Let's go, Cap! Let's go!

23:29.416 --> 23:31.916
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.083
- Oh, boo yourself!

23:36.583 --> 23:39.375
<i>...James Powell, who was</i>

<i>of Racial Equality</i>

23:52.666 --> 23:54.791
<i>plan a rally in</i>
<i>the evening hours outside</i>

23:54.875 --> 23:57.125
<i>the 123rd Street Precinct.</i>

23:57.208 --> 23:58.875
<i>While Black nationalist</i>
<i>Malcolm X...</i>

23:58.958 --> 24:02.083
- People gonna get
they heads beat in.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.916
Jesus watches over
fools and babies.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.750
Two things this city's
full of, tell you that.

24:09.708 --> 24:12.166
Hot out there.
Gettin' hotter.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.958
I'm glad you got
the early shift.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.041
The kid was
sitting on his stoop.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.083
You think the bullet
knew the difference?

24:23.208 --> 24:24.625
I think the cop did.

24:25.958 --> 24:27.208
What did you say?

24:27.291 --> 24:28.875
Al...

24:28.958 --> 24:30.666
What'd you say?

24:31.416 --> 24:33.708
Father of us all.

24:33.791 --> 24:36.291
This meal is a sign
of your love for us.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.041
- Yes.
- Bless us

24:38.125 --> 24:40.583
- and bless this food.
- Mm-hmm.

24:40.666 --> 24:44.291
And help us to give Your name
the glory each and every day.

24:44.375 --> 24:47.541
- Each day.
- Through Jesus Christ,
our lord.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.708
- Amen.
- Amen.

25:02.250 --> 25:05.458
We down four,
but we about to be up 20!

25:07.041 --> 25:10.750
Shake it, Jack!
Shake your hair!
Come on now, baby!

25:17.916 --> 25:19.666
Cap!

25:19.750 --> 25:21.083
Not in the mood.

25:21.166 --> 25:24.208
That's my concern.
I know my system
takes adjusting to.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.250
Another coach,
another system.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.333
Yeah. And I'm sure
that that gets tiring,

25:28.416 --> 25:32.208
but I need your help.
We're playing
four-on-five out there.

25:32.291 --> 25:34.583
I need you running the floor
with everybody else.

25:36.208 --> 25:39.208
This team is looking
to its leader.

25:40.458 --> 25:43.000
The game'll slow down
in the fourth.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.625
They'll put the ball
in my hands.

25:45.708 --> 25:50.125
End of the night,
we'll have my 30 points,
10 boards.

25:50.208 --> 25:53.791
My guess? I'll lead the team.

25:53.875 --> 25:57.083
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

25:59.375 --> 26:01.250
<i>Number 24, World B. Free,</i>
<i>with the ball.</i>

26:01.333 --> 26:02.791
<i>He's a hot shooter tonight.</i>

26:02.875 --> 26:05.041
<i>- Off to Bryant on the wing.</i>

26:07.833 --> 26:10.833
<i>- Out of bounds.</i>
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

26:10.916 --> 26:13.416
<i>And now we've got a contest.</i>

26:13.500 --> 26:15.333
<i>Everybody wants to play ref.</i>

26:16.500 --> 26:18.041
<i>Last touched by...</i>

26:18.125 --> 26:19.708
<i>gotta be,</i>
<i>it's gotta be Laker ball.</i>

26:22.083 --> 26:23.916
<i>Come on, ref.</i>
<i>Let's get an answer.</i>

26:24.000 --> 26:25.166
...from his foot!

26:25.250 --> 26:26.625
<i>Come on, call it, ref.</i>

26:26.708 --> 26:28.333
Lakers!

26:30.250 --> 26:31.291
<i>And so it is, Laker ball.</i>

26:31.375 --> 26:33.041
- Time out, time out!

26:33.125 --> 26:34.791
<i>McKinney is off the bench</i>
<i>for time.</i>

26:34.875 --> 26:36.208
<i>And let's see</i>
<i>what happens here.</i>

26:43.250 --> 26:44.625
<i>They're gonna take</i>
<i>a time out.</i>

26:44.708 --> 26:46.041
<i>Now, folks,</i>
<i>if you're just tuning in,</i>

26:46.125 --> 26:47.416
<i>you're late for</i>
<i>a very close contest,</i>

26:47.500 --> 26:48.791
<i>but a disappointing one</i>
<i>at that</i>

26:48.875 --> 26:50.166
<i>for these</i>
<i>highly touted Lakers.</i>

26:50.250 --> 26:52.666
<i>Down by one with</i>
<i>four seconds to play,</i>

26:52.750 --> 26:54.416
<i>facing an opening</i>
<i>night belly flop</i>

26:54.500 --> 26:56.125
<i>against their lowly</i>
<i>siblings to the south.</i>

26:56.208 --> 26:58.208
<i>Well, I tell you, Chick,</i>
<i>the, uh, difference here</i>

26:58.291 --> 26:59.416
<i>seems to be Kareem.</i>

26:59.500 --> 27:01.541
<i>He's put up solid</i>
<i>numbers in the fourth,</i>

27:01.625 --> 27:03.875
<i>but every touch,</i>
<i>he slows the pace.</i>

27:03.958 --> 27:05.583
<i>Now, if I'm the coach,</i>
<i>the first--</i>

27:07.416 --> 27:09.500
<i>Who knows what evil lurks</i>
<i>inside your pipes?</i>

27:09.583 --> 27:11.000
<i>Adee do, that's who.</i>

27:11.083 --> 27:13.708
<i>That's Adee Plumbing.</i>
<i>Find them in the Yellow Pages.</i>

27:13.791 --> 27:15.375
Magic, take it in.

27:15.458 --> 27:16.916
Spencer,
back-screen for Norm.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.041
That's first option.
Second option,

27:19.125 --> 27:20.708
Jamaal with a jumper. Right?

27:20.791 --> 27:22.875
- No Cap?
- That's a play.

27:22.958 --> 27:26.166
- Team on three.
One, two, three...
- Team!

27:26.250 --> 27:28.250
You should go holler
at your boy, Silk.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.916
- Me?
- Y'all both Muslims, right?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.625
I'm not dying in a holy war.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.083
Let's go, fellas, let's go.
Come on!

27:40.166 --> 27:42.625
Come on,
let's go win this thing!
Let's go!

27:53.000 --> 27:54.833
<i>Magic Johnson</i>
<i>to inbound the ball,</i>

27:54.916 --> 27:57.125
<i>and Jellybean Bryant</i>
<i>defending him.</i>

27:57.208 --> 27:59.041
<i>Congratulations to</i>
<i>Jellybean Bryant,</i>

27:59.125 --> 28:00.625
<i>his new son, Kobe,</i>
<i>is here in the audience.</i>

28:00.708 --> 28:02.208
<i>Kobe Bean.</i>
<i>I'm not making that up.</i>

28:02.291 --> 28:05.083
<i>- I believe it's Japanese.</i>

28:05.166 --> 28:08.250
<i>Looking for Nixon</i>
<i>who's stacked and</i>
<i>struggling to get open.</i>

28:08.333 --> 28:10.083
<i>The Lakers really</i>
<i>need a bucket here.</i>

28:10.166 --> 28:12.458
<i>And Wilkes on the right side</i>
<i>looking to get free.</i>

28:12.541 --> 28:14.333
<i>Kareem is single,</i>
<i>double, triple teamed</i>

28:14.416 --> 28:15.458
<i>right in the center there.</i>

28:15.541 --> 28:17.375
<i>The Clippers doing</i>
<i>everything they can</i>

28:17.458 --> 28:19.375
<i>to keep the ball</i>
<i>out of his hands.</i>

28:19.458 --> 28:20.708
<i>Jamaal free in the corner.</i>

28:20.791 --> 28:22.375
<i>He's going for it.</i>
<i>But no!</i>

28:22.458 --> 28:25.416
<i>He finds Kareem with</i>
<i>the skyyyyyyhoooook!</i>

28:33.583 --> 28:35.666
<i>- It's good! It's good!</i>
<i>- Oh my!</i>

28:35.750 --> 28:38.541
<i>And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</i>
<i>has just handed the Lakers</i>

28:38.625 --> 28:42.291
<i>their first victory</i>
<i>of the season.</i>
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

28:42.375 --> 28:45.583
<i> And Magic Johnson</i>
<i>out there, hugging Kareem</i>

28:45.666 --> 28:48.625
<i>like he's just won Game Seven</i>
<i>of the World Championship.</i>

28:48.708 --> 28:51.125
<i>Patrick, that's why they</i>
<i>call him Magic Johnson.</i>

28:51.208 --> 28:53.583
What you doin'?
Get the fuck off me!

28:53.666 --> 28:56.458
Hey, we won, Cap!
Look at all them fans!

28:56.541 --> 28:59.083
- We got 81 more
games to go.
- Damn right!

28:59.166 --> 29:00.666
You hit 81 more
shots like that,

29:00.750 --> 29:03.583
I'ma give you 81 more hugs.
Come on, Cap, get happy!

29:03.666 --> 29:06.416
- Get with it, baby!
- Holy cow, big fella!

29:06.500 --> 29:08.083
- What a shot!
<i>- Allahu akbar.</i>

29:08.166 --> 29:11.083
Unbelievable! Abdul-Jabbar
gives God the glory,

29:11.166 --> 29:13.666
<i>but seals the victory tonight</i>
<i>for the Lakers</i>

29:13.750 --> 29:16.291
<i>with a miraculous</i>
<i>shot at the buzzer.</i>

29:16.375 --> 29:18.791
Jack. Hey!

29:18.875 --> 29:20.791
- We're off to the races.
- Yeah.

29:20.875 --> 29:23.416
- I wanna see the stat sheet.
- Okay, stat sheet.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.416
Why? What's up?

29:28.250 --> 29:30.416
I'll be goddamned.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.291
30 and 10.

29:32.375 --> 29:35.625
- Huh?
- It's just exactly
what he said.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.333
Jack. Hey.

29:38.416 --> 29:40.583
- We won.
- Yeah, yeah.

29:41.916 --> 29:44.000
<i>With a final score of 103-102,</i>

29:44.083 --> 29:46.583
<i>the Lakers off to a somewhat</i>
<i>questionable beginning</i>

29:46.666 --> 29:48.500
<i>of their season</i>
<i>earlier tonight,</i>

29:48.583 --> 29:50.750
<i>pulling out a win</i>
<i>with a buzzer-beater</i>

29:50.833 --> 29:52.541
<i>against the lower-ranked</i>
<i>Clippers,</i>

29:52.625 --> 29:54.833
<i>despite new owner Jerry Buss</i>
<i>paying an arm and a leg</i>

29:54.916 --> 29:57.000
<i>on personnel this off-season.</i>

29:57.083 --> 29:58.375
Let's be perfect!

29:58.458 --> 30:00.708
<i>This was a game</i>
<i>to be part of...</i>

30:00.791 --> 30:02.583
You won't be happy
till we're in ruins, too.

30:02.666 --> 30:05.125
<i>...incredible action.</i>
<i>Now moving on to hockey...</i>

30:09.666 --> 30:12.291
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.208
Yes, you guys. Love it!

30:14.291 --> 30:17.541
Good. Stay together.
I see you, Marie! Sharp!

30:18.416 --> 30:21.000
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

30:21.083 --> 30:22.166
Go one two, one two...

30:22.250 --> 30:23.666
<i>You don't know how</i>
<i>hard it was for me</i>

30:23.750 --> 30:25.666
<i>to get in that</i>
<i>dance company.</i>

30:25.750 --> 30:27.250
Bernice thinks I'm 19.

30:27.333 --> 30:30.583
Look, it's only three nights
a week and practices,

30:30.666 --> 30:33.958
and you'll be dancing for
the biggest stars in Hollywood.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.750
I'm talking Michael Jackson,

30:35.833 --> 30:37.708
Stevie Wonder.

30:37.791 --> 30:40.750
- He can't see!
- He'll hear the applause.

30:42.125 --> 30:43.791
Head girl?

30:44.916 --> 30:47.083
And choreographer.
What do you say?

30:53.541 --> 30:55.083
- Yeah!

31:28.375 --> 31:30.708
You're still my father.

31:35.541 --> 31:39.083
But you don't want
your father's name.

31:39.166 --> 31:41.375
Alcindor was
a French plantation owner.

31:41.458 --> 31:44.083
Our people are Yoruba tribesmen.

31:44.166 --> 31:47.833
- You taught me that.
- I taught you so you'd
know your history.

31:47.916 --> 31:50.708
Not throw it all away
to rile up some white folks

31:50.791 --> 31:52.333
with a bullseye
on your back.

31:52.416 --> 31:54.416
Look, God gave me a voice.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.625
He put me here.

31:55.708 --> 31:58.541
It is not on you
to change the world.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.083
Then who?

32:02.583 --> 32:03.833
I need to do more with my life

32:03.916 --> 32:07.583
than play a game that makes me
rich and makes them happy.

32:07.666 --> 32:09.375
I know that's all
they want to see,

32:09.458 --> 32:11.833
<i>but it's on me if</i>
<i>I don't show them more.</i>

32:14.166 --> 32:17.375
It must have been hard
for you coming up.

32:17.458 --> 32:19.666
Must feel good
to belong to somethin'.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.208
So what does it mean?

32:23.875 --> 32:25.500
The name?

32:30.375 --> 32:32.000
Servant of the Almighty.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.791
I saw his face when
he was hugging you,

32:38.875 --> 32:41.250
hanging off your neck
like a damn koala bear.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.375
You know I can't dig
the clown show.

32:44.458 --> 32:48.083
- Dancin' and grinnin'
for the crowd.

32:48.166 --> 32:52.000
- So you mad 'cause he happy?
- You know it's more than that.

32:53.541 --> 32:55.375
When we came up,
we put it on ourselves

32:55.458 --> 32:56.958
<i>to stand for something more.</i>

32:57.041 --> 32:58.666
<i>The Supreme Court</i>
<i>will take up the case...</i>

32:58.750 --> 33:01.041
<i>We took the boos.</i>
<i>We took the hate.</i>

33:01.125 --> 33:02.833
<i>...to sue the NBA for</i>
<i>the right to leave college...</i>

33:02.916 --> 33:05.958
Black man, you took the league
to the Supreme Court.

33:06.041 --> 33:09.958
It was a racist-ass rule,
and you made a difference.

33:10.041 --> 33:12.666
Look, I'm not saying
that I regret it,

33:12.750 --> 33:14.791
but there's been time I did.

33:14.875 --> 33:18.583
I mean, shit, you talkin'
about four teams in 10 years?

33:18.666 --> 33:21.916
You talkin' about
every owner in the league

33:22.000 --> 33:23.500
treating me like a pariah.

33:23.583 --> 33:27.125
Once you ring
the white man's bell,
they don't forget.

33:27.208 --> 33:30.500
And they drove me to
a dark, dark place.

33:30.583 --> 33:32.791
Like, I'm angry at the man.

33:32.875 --> 33:35.791
I was angry at the brothers
who I helped make it easier for.

33:35.875 --> 33:39.125
I was just angry,
and that anger...

33:39.208 --> 33:41.791
it almost burned me up.

33:43.958 --> 33:45.500
I heard stories.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.916
I worried about you.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.083
Whatever you heard,
it was worse.

33:53.333 --> 33:56.541
I mean, I went 12 rounds
with that demon.

33:56.625 --> 33:59.041
He knocked my ass out.

33:59.125 --> 34:00.791
But here you are.

34:01.541 --> 34:02.875
And I shouldn't be.

34:04.166 --> 34:06.208
I got a second chance at life.

34:07.666 --> 34:10.083
You know it all
come back to you.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.541
You and me both.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.458
Get your money, man.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.083
- What's the word?
- I don't know.
He was holding it.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.916
- I couldn't see anything.
- Goddamn, Midnight.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.041
- Can't you do anything right?
- You go take a look then.

34:47.125 --> 34:48.875
I don't even believe
any of this anyhow.

34:48.958 --> 34:51.166
Man cutting his own dick.
What?

34:51.250 --> 34:54.208
About to get your ass in there.
I got money on that thing.

34:54.291 --> 34:57.458
What y'all talking about?
This thing?

34:59.208 --> 35:01.291
Yeah? Feast your eyes.

35:01.375 --> 35:04.666
- Goddamn.
- See, y'all done y'all
shit at the hospitals.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.500
Those cats'll trim you up
like a cheap-ass steak.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.958
- Oh my god, it's swingin'.
- I'm from Mississippi.

35:09.041 --> 35:11.041
Down there, we like to handle
things a little differently.

35:11.125 --> 35:13.500
We like to take matters
into our own hands.

35:13.583 --> 35:15.666
So, I grabbed it,

35:15.750 --> 35:18.958
I held it down like
a copperhead snake,

35:19.041 --> 35:20.625
I did the deed.

35:20.708 --> 35:23.000
- Damn...
- Hey, pay up.
You heard him.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.125
- Give me my money.
- Shit.

35:25.208 --> 35:26.791
- Cool. Cool.
- I told you not
to make that bet.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.125
- I know.
- I told you--

35:28.208 --> 35:29.750
That's my money, man!

35:29.833 --> 35:32.208
- Shit, I earned this.

35:32.291 --> 35:36.000
- Sorry, Stormin'.
- Come on, y'all
are stupid, man.

35:36.083 --> 35:38.375
- Mr. Jabbar.
- Peace.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.625
Yo, you got
a minute, Rook?

35:50.583 --> 35:51.916
Yeah!

35:53.416 --> 35:55.333
Let me holler at you.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.541
So, what's up, Cap?

36:15.625 --> 36:18.083
I've had a little while
to get to know you now.

36:18.166 --> 36:20.708
- Mm-hm.
- I've seen your game up close.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.875
I wanna let you know that...

36:24.666 --> 36:26.125
I appreciate the...

36:27.041 --> 36:28.916
youthful energy you bring.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.458
Word? Well...
Thanks, Cap.

36:32.541 --> 36:35.166
- That's somethin' else.
- You're welcome.

36:35.250 --> 36:37.083
But this is bigger
than the game.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.750
How you comport yourself,

36:38.833 --> 36:41.416
- how people receive you
in the public eye?
- Mm-hmm.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.500
That's how the world
sees all of us.
Everybody.

36:43.583 --> 36:45.875
Y...

36:45.958 --> 36:48.041
You sayin' I don't act right?

36:49.625 --> 36:52.000
I'm saying...

36:52.083 --> 36:55.541
if you want respect
within this team,

36:55.625 --> 36:57.750
young brother,
you have to show some.

36:58.791 --> 37:00.416
I have to show some respect?

37:01.291 --> 37:02.583
For this team?

37:02.666 --> 37:06.000
The team that you
don't even run for.

37:06.083 --> 37:08.166
The team that I've been
workin' my ass off

37:08.250 --> 37:10.000
trying to bring together?
That team?

37:10.083 --> 37:11.708
We all call you Cap,

37:11.791 --> 37:14.083
but you ain't leading
shit 'round here!

37:14.166 --> 37:15.625
You stoppin' it.

37:15.708 --> 37:17.083
We out there running
like Ferraris,

37:17.166 --> 37:20.083
while your old ass moving
like a Cutlass on two flats!

37:20.166 --> 37:21.458
- What did you say to me, boy?
- You heard.

37:21.541 --> 37:23.416
Everybody else just
too afraid to say it.

37:23.500 --> 37:24.500
Evil as you is,

37:24.583 --> 37:26.333
walkin' around
mad at the whole world--

37:26.416 --> 37:28.958
Get in! Get in there!

37:34.750 --> 37:37.333
Get your hands off!
Get your goddamn hands off me!

37:37.416 --> 37:38.708
Get your fucking hands off me!

37:38.791 --> 37:40.500
Get your hands off me!

37:43.500 --> 37:45.208
- Shit.
- What the fuck
wrong with y'all, man!

37:45.291 --> 37:46.666
What the fuck was that?

37:55.250 --> 37:56.916
<i>At center,</i>

37:57.000 --> 37:59.333
<i>seven-foot-two, from UCLA,</i>

37:59.416 --> 38:01.000
<i>number 33,</i>

38:01.083 --> 38:03.958
<i>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</i>

38:10.833 --> 38:12.958
<i>James Powell, gunned down</i>

38:13.041 --> 38:15.541
<i>by NYPD Lieutenant</i>
<i>Thomas Gilligan...</i>

38:15.625 --> 38:17.875
<i>I need to do more with</i>
<i>my life than play a game</i>

38:17.958 --> 38:20.166
<i>that makes me rich</i>
<i>and makes them happy.</i>

38:20.250 --> 38:21.875
<i>We don't hate anybody!</i>

38:21.958 --> 38:23.625
<i>We love our</i>
<i>own people so much,</i>

38:23.708 --> 38:25.083
<i>they think we hate the ones</i>

38:25.166 --> 38:27.500
<i>who are inflicting</i>
<i>injustice against them.</i>

38:27.583 --> 38:29.083
<i>Lew is the-- probably</i>

38:29.166 --> 38:30.750
<i>the deepest boy</i>
<i>on the entire team,</i>

38:30.833 --> 38:34.666
<i>concerned about many things</i>
<i>other than just basketball.</i>

38:34.750 --> 38:37.000
<i>What do we want? Freedom!</i>

38:38.750 --> 38:42.541
- <i> But I think</i>
<i>that the white backlash--</i>

38:42.625 --> 38:44.458
<i>The people are gonna have</i>
<i>to stand up against--</i>

38:46.083 --> 38:49.208
<i>God gave me a voice.</i>
<i>He put me here!</i>

38:49.291 --> 38:51.458
<i> What is your name?</i>

39:23.708 --> 39:25.291
<i>As-salaam alaykum.</i>

39:26.875 --> 39:28.166
<i>Wa-alaykum salaam.</i>

39:28.250 --> 39:30.083
Welcome, brother.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.125
It's rare we have a man
of your stature

39:32.208 --> 39:35.125
in this humble
place of worship.

39:37.458 --> 39:41.375
It's been a while since I've
seen the inside of a mosque.

39:41.458 --> 39:44.500
Well, Allah's glad to have you,
brother, just the same.

39:46.875 --> 39:48.583
All is well?

39:48.666 --> 39:50.583
I can't say it is.

39:52.666 --> 39:54.291
I can't seem to pray on it.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.708
I try.

39:58.791 --> 40:02.458
I say the words,
five times a day.

40:03.750 --> 40:05.708
But they're not
coming from my heart.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.458
They used to.

40:10.375 --> 40:13.583
Are you afraid
God is lost to you?

40:14.791 --> 40:17.166
- Maybe I'm afraid to face him.
- Mm-hm.

40:21.333 --> 40:24.125
When I came to Allah
as a younger man...

40:25.250 --> 40:27.000
my faith was purer.

40:28.416 --> 40:30.333
For the first time in my life,

40:30.416 --> 40:32.375
I felt I had a purpose.

40:33.458 --> 40:35.083
I made myself...

40:35.750 --> 40:37.333
a rich man.

40:39.958 --> 40:42.041
Famous for...

40:43.208 --> 40:45.666
because I put a ball
into a basket.

40:46.666 --> 40:48.541
<i>But now, I see this world.</i>

40:48.625 --> 40:49.916
<i>I see a world</i>

40:50.000 --> 40:52.708
that is no better
for my being here.

40:57.166 --> 40:58.541
And yet,

40:58.625 --> 41:01.166
He still shines
his light on you.

41:03.416 --> 41:05.291
Why?

41:07.041 --> 41:09.750
People booed me
when I changed my name.

41:10.958 --> 41:13.583
And now, they cheer me, and...

41:14.458 --> 41:16.000
it feels exactly the same.

41:16.083 --> 41:17.541
I hate them for it.

41:17.625 --> 41:20.500
I push them away
because they all see a hero.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.125
And I see a clown.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.875
Then you've forgotten
your own name.

41:29.916 --> 41:32.041
Abdul-Jabbar.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.791
Servant of the Almighty.

41:34.875 --> 41:37.458
God's instrument.

41:37.541 --> 41:40.375
Not God.

41:40.458 --> 41:42.666
It ain't on us
to take His place.

41:42.750 --> 41:46.250
All we can do is be
examples of His love.

41:46.333 --> 41:48.916
That's why He made
you so strong.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.583
So you could walk His path.

41:51.666 --> 41:53.416
That's why
He made you tall,

41:53.500 --> 41:56.750
so other men could see
and become inspired.

41:58.583 --> 42:01.333
And that's why He gave
you knees, brother.

42:01.416 --> 42:04.583
So you can kneel
with everybody else.

42:10.750 --> 42:12.208
Can I pray with you?

42:20.875 --> 42:22.875
<i>I'll tell you, buying a team</i>
<i>ain't like buying a building.</i>

42:22.958 --> 42:24.708
<i>I think this guy is</i>
<i>clearly out of his league.</i>

42:24.791 --> 42:27.125
<i>He thinks this team</i>
<i>is just another boat or car</i>

42:27.208 --> 42:28.583
<i>- to show off.</i>

42:28.666 --> 42:30.291
<i>I really don't know</i>
<i>what's worse,</i>

42:30.375 --> 42:31.791
<i>the fact he doesn't know</i>
<i>what he's doing</i>

42:31.875 --> 42:33.458
<i>or the fact that</i>
<i>he thinks he does.</i>

42:33.541 --> 42:34.708
<i>No, he's finding out</i>

42:34.791 --> 42:36.291
<i>losing games never</i>
<i>looks good on anyone.</i>

42:36.375 --> 42:38.458
<i>He's treating this franchise</i>
<i>like his plaything,</i>

42:38.541 --> 42:41.250
<i>like it's just another pair</i>
<i>of dungarees for him to trash.</i>

42:41.333 --> 42:43.041
<i> Yeah, stupid</i>
<i>and cocky is a bad mix.</i>

42:43.125 --> 42:44.375
- Fuck you.
- <i> I'm telling you,</i>

42:44.458 --> 42:46.291
<i>this guy needs to go</i>
<i>back to real estate</i>

42:46.375 --> 42:48.250
<i>and leave pro sports</i>
<i>to the pros.</i>

42:48.333 --> 42:49.833
Why don't you go
fuck yourself?

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
Got something to show you.

42:54.083 --> 42:55.250
<i>Wow.</i>

42:55.333 --> 42:56.875
I thought you said you
weren't gonna be ready

42:56.958 --> 42:58.083
for a week or two!

42:58.166 --> 42:59.416
I pulled some strings.

42:59.500 --> 43:02.500
Promised the inspector
tickets to the Ice Capades.

43:03.375 --> 43:04.500
So?

43:05.416 --> 43:07.208
We're ready to open! Yeah?

43:07.291 --> 43:09.583
If you like what
you see, and, uh,

43:09.666 --> 43:11.375
- this is-- this is you.

43:11.458 --> 43:14.083
Look at that. Fantastic.

43:15.416 --> 43:16.666
Wow.

43:16.750 --> 43:19.166
Did you check out
the sound system?
Is it perfect?

43:19.250 --> 43:20.500
Well, Jeanie...

43:20.583 --> 43:22.166
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it sounds great.

43:22.250 --> 43:24.083
And wait for the best part.

43:51.250 --> 43:52.500
Yeah.

44:17.333 --> 44:19.416
- Wow. Ladies.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.583
That was amazing,
That ain't ballet,
I tell you that.

44:22.666 --> 44:24.125
Now, that is a vision.

44:24.208 --> 44:26.791
That is female empowerment
right there.

44:26.875 --> 44:28.500
- You said it.
- Incredible!

44:28.583 --> 44:30.666
Claire, I can't believe
you pulled it off.

44:30.750 --> 44:33.250
- Thank you.
- We officially have a vision.

44:33.333 --> 44:34.708
- Look at this!

44:34.791 --> 44:37.875
- We really did it.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.166
What's this here?

44:40.833 --> 44:41.958
What?

44:42.041 --> 44:44.291
Wait, I thought we said
we're going to fix this.

44:46.458 --> 44:48.250
It's supposed to be flush here.

44:48.333 --> 44:50.875
- Yeah, I'll, uh, we'll give
maintenance a call right away.

44:50.958 --> 44:53.500
Yeah, you can really notice
it there, so, you know...

44:53.583 --> 44:55.916
Maybe I can just get it--
get it to set down.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.083
- Why isn't this flush?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.833
Ow... oh.

45:35.083 --> 45:36.625
Grandma?

45:38.000 --> 45:39.750
It's Jeanie!

45:43.625 --> 45:45.583
Why are you here?

45:46.583 --> 45:48.083
I'm here to pick you up.

45:48.166 --> 45:51.916
Monopoly, that's Thursdays.
This isn't Thursday.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.458
The-the home opener.

45:55.208 --> 45:56.333
Yes!

45:56.416 --> 45:58.291
Yes. Yes.

45:59.583 --> 46:00.833
And that's why
I'm going to bed.

46:00.916 --> 46:04.333
I can't stand to watch my son
humiliate himself.

46:04.416 --> 46:06.708
But it would mean so much
to him to have you there,
Grandma.

46:06.791 --> 46:10.625
Oh, you have certainly
swallowed the line.

46:10.708 --> 46:14.375
Uh-uh. He needs us
when he's down.

46:14.458 --> 46:17.291
When things are looking up,
he'll be looking somewhere else.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.750
You just go, sweetie, go! Go!

46:56.958 --> 47:00.000
Jeanie called, said you
had a little bar fight.

47:05.041 --> 47:06.500
Yeah.

47:06.583 --> 47:08.166
The bar won.

47:10.708 --> 47:12.041
Well, uh...

47:13.125 --> 47:14.791
I wouldn't count you out.

47:20.208 --> 47:21.833
I'm sorry, Frank.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.708
Yeah, well, you know.

47:32.791 --> 47:36.000
Where would I be without
Jerry fuckin' Buss?

47:36.791 --> 47:38.875
- Happy.
- Hm!

47:38.958 --> 47:40.291
I'm the happy one.

47:41.083 --> 47:42.875
Bored.

47:42.958 --> 47:45.791
Bored. That's what I'd be.

47:47.083 --> 47:50.375
You know what I can't
stop thinkin' about?

47:50.458 --> 47:53.458
Remember the Comstock building?
When did we buy that? '63? '64?

47:53.541 --> 47:55.375
You had your eye
on that one for years.

47:55.458 --> 47:58.750
I have never wanted
anything more in my life.

47:58.833 --> 48:01.625
And the day we closed,
I went up

48:01.708 --> 48:04.833
to the top floor, and I stood
in the middle of that room,

48:04.916 --> 48:07.708
and I cried.

48:07.791 --> 48:11.333
Tears of fuckin' joy, Frank.

48:13.541 --> 48:15.958
And then, five minutes later,

48:16.041 --> 48:18.666
it was just another
fuckin' thing that I owned.

48:18.750 --> 48:20.416
We made a hell of
a killing on it.

48:20.500 --> 48:21.583
This was supposed
to be different.

48:21.666 --> 48:25.125
- This was supposed to last.
- This? This?

48:25.208 --> 48:28.208
This is-- It is!
And it will be!

48:28.291 --> 48:31.666
And we'll make it so!
It's going to be great!

48:31.750 --> 48:35.083
- It's going to be fucking great!
- Until it's not enough.

48:35.166 --> 48:37.291
You said it.

48:37.375 --> 48:40.541
What's wrong with me?
What am I going to do then?

48:40.625 --> 48:43.833
I don't know, I'm not--
I'm not-- I'm not a shrink.

48:43.916 --> 48:47.250
I don't know.

48:47.333 --> 48:49.666
What am I going to tell you
that you don't already know?

48:49.750 --> 48:54.083
There's more to
the cliff than the edge.

48:54.166 --> 48:55.666
You got to give
yourself permission

48:55.750 --> 48:58.250
every once in a while
to take a step back,

48:58.333 --> 48:59.958
enjoy the fuckin' view.

49:01.750 --> 49:03.333
I heard that somewhere.

49:06.875 --> 49:08.250
Yeah...

49:08.333 --> 49:10.375
I mean...

49:10.458 --> 49:12.375
It ain't a bad view.

49:14.208 --> 49:17.250
Let's go! Lakers!

49:17.333 --> 49:19.000
Let's go! Lakers!

49:19.083 --> 49:20.875
<i>A chant now from</i>
<i>this rabid crowd.</i>

49:20.958 --> 49:23.625
<i>Anticipation through the roof</i>
<i>for the home opener</i>

49:23.708 --> 49:25.041
<i>of what promises to be</i>

49:25.125 --> 49:27.833
<i>what everybody hopes will be</i>
<i>a special kind of season</i>

49:27.916 --> 49:30.208
<i>for these Lakers.</i>

49:34.625 --> 49:36.875
- Y'all ready?
- Come on, boys!

49:39.500 --> 49:42.166
Alright, alright!
Bring it in, bring it in!

49:42.250 --> 49:45.583
Keep the pace up.
Lakers basketball.

49:47.875 --> 49:49.250
Let's go, fellas.

49:50.166 --> 49:51.291
Team on three.

49:54.416 --> 49:57.083
- One, two, three, team!
- Team!

50:05.833 --> 50:08.166
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

50:30.625 --> 50:33.708
<i>But first, introducing...</i>

50:35.041 --> 50:36.750
Hey, stick around.

50:36.833 --> 50:38.083
I gotta go drain
the weasel though.

50:38.166 --> 50:41.041
Your weasel's gonna
wanna see this.

50:41.125 --> 50:42.625
So is yours.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.375
Code red. Go! Go!

50:46.458 --> 50:49.416
<i>...the Laker Girls!</i>

51:21.500 --> 51:23.875
Hey, where's
your grandma?

51:23.958 --> 51:26.833
Oh, she's under the weather,
wasn't feeling up to it.

51:28.583 --> 51:30.333
Ah, first of many, right?

52:26.291 --> 52:28.583
- <i> Whoa!</i>

52:28.666 --> 52:31.708
<i>Magic with eyes in the back</i>
<i>of his head. Oh my.</i>

52:31.791 --> 52:33.250
<i>Oh, you gotta love</i>
<i>the effort by Kareem</i>

52:33.333 --> 52:34.666
<i>on both sides of</i>
<i>the floor, Patrick.</i>

52:34.750 --> 52:37.000
<i>Crowd is on its feet,</i>
<i>and listen to 'em roar.</i>

52:42.500 --> 52:44.375
<i>I'll tell you, Pat,</i>
<i>the Lord and four disciples</i>

52:44.458 --> 52:46.166
<i>could not beat</i>
<i>the Lakers right now.</i>

52:46.250 --> 52:48.000
<i>Yeah, I see</i>
<i>Jack McKinney smiling.</i>

52:52.000 --> 52:54.083
<i>You know, Chick, I think, uh,</i>

52:54.166 --> 52:56.375
<i>Kareem is smiling, too.</i>

52:56.458 --> 52:58.750
<i>- We'll check the skies.</i>
<i>It's a full moon.</i>

52:58.833 --> 53:00.416
<i>And the Bulls are gonna</i>
<i>take a timeout on the floor,</i>

53:00.500 --> 53:02.125
<i>and we'll take it right</i>
<i>there with 'em right here</i>

53:02.208 --> 53:04.208
<i>on the Lakers</i>
<i>Basketball Network.</i>

53:13.375 --> 53:15.250
Nah, Cap. That's old school.

53:15.333 --> 53:17.500
You gotta bring it up.
Hit me up here!

53:19.041 --> 53:20.166
Let's go!

53:23.375 --> 53:25.208
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

53:39.875 --> 53:43.666
<i> Holy cow!</i>
<i>The Lakers are off</i>
<i>to a blistering start.</i>

53:43.750 --> 53:46.750
<i>My friends,</i>
<i>Jack McKinney is making</i>
<i>John Wooden</i>

53:46.833 --> 53:48.958
<i>look like Grandma Moses.</i>

54:15.083 --> 54:17.000
Hey!

54:17.083 --> 54:20.083
I stole these from
the visitor's locker room.

54:20.166 --> 54:22.125
- I think they lost so bad,

54:22.208 --> 54:24.083
they needed
something stronger.

54:24.166 --> 54:25.333
Uh-oh!

54:25.416 --> 54:27.958
- I'll drink to that.
- Good. Join me!

54:35.000 --> 54:36.166
Oh!

54:38.625 --> 54:40.708
Does it feel the way
that you pictured

54:40.791 --> 54:42.875
in your head
all these years?

54:50.833 --> 54:52.291
Better.

54:52.375 --> 54:53.958
Good.

55:01.375 --> 55:03.500
I, uh, see you smile?

55:04.291 --> 55:06.666
There!

55:24.125 --> 55:27.208
Okay. No more basketball.
It's your day off.

55:30.416 --> 55:31.583
Oh...

55:31.666 --> 55:34.916
- I don't want to jinx it.
- You've earned a day off.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.208
Anyway, I'm taking
the car with Cassie.

55:37.291 --> 55:40.583
So, why don't you go meet Paul

55:40.666 --> 55:43.041
for some tennis or something?

55:43.125 --> 55:45.916
- The fresh air will do you good.
- Mm.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.041
That doesn't
sound like an answer.

55:50.041 --> 55:52.583
- I love you.
- I love you.

55:52.666 --> 55:54.458
Have fun.
