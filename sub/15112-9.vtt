WEBVTT

00:03.039 --> 00:05.125
Ok everyone, this is
the game of the year,

00:05.147 --> 00:08.509
and we want things to go as
trouble free as is possible.

00:08.931 --> 00:12.331
I want check-points at all the major
intersections around the stadium.

00:12.386 --> 00:15.060
And extra patrols at potential hot-spots.

00:15.092 --> 00:16.976
If you see anything,
step in,

00:17.047 --> 00:20.082
making nothing before it has a chance
to become something.

00:20.157 --> 00:21.741
<i>History is an indicator,</i>
<i>these bowl games,</i>

00:21.775 --> 00:23.309
<i>they get pretty unruly.</i>

00:23.327 --> 00:26.863
<i>There's small space, huge</i>
<i>crowd, an ocean of alcohol,</i>

00:26.897 --> 00:29.449
<i>and some die-hard</i>
<i>out-of-town fans</i>

00:29.483 --> 00:31.951
<i>who have come a long way</i>
<i>to root for their team.</i>

00:31.986 --> 00:33.119
L'Jacks.

00:33.153 --> 00:35.121
L'Jacks.

00:35.155 --> 00:36.155
Yeah, okay.

00:36.189 --> 00:38.357
L'Jacks stink, dude!

00:38.375 --> 00:41.210
Who threw
the ball?

00:41.245 --> 00:43.663
Come on, you big bulldogs,
throw it in my face!

00:43.697 --> 00:45.081
Rob, can we just
go inside, man?

00:45.132 --> 00:47.467
What'd I say
about being a puss?!

00:47.501 --> 00:49.035
You got to stand up
to these people.

00:49.053 --> 00:50.036
Who threw it?!

00:50.054 --> 00:51.921
Seattle sucks!

00:51.972 --> 00:53.806
Who wants to diss Seattle
to my face?!

00:53.841 --> 00:55.008
Whatever.

00:56.427 --> 00:58.478
Your job is to make sure
the only thing

00:58.512 --> 01:01.431
newsworthy about this game
is the score.

01:08.605 --> 01:10.940
You heard me...
A hundred on Seattle.

01:10.991 --> 01:12.659
Man
You sure you can cover it, John?

01:12.693 --> 01:13.910
Something happens
to your other arm,

01:13.944 --> 01:15.361
you won't be able
to run your business.

01:15.395 --> 01:17.530
Don't worry.
I've been following this one.

01:17.564 --> 01:18.781
This one's good.

01:18.832 --> 01:20.366
I've got you down for Seattle,
minus one.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.068
Hundred thousand.

01:22.086 --> 01:23.870
Whatever happens, John,

01:23.904 --> 01:26.005
I better not have to come
looking for you.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.907
Just make the bet.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.684
You're kidding me.

01:37.718 --> 01:39.469
You're actually going?

01:39.503 --> 01:42.271
Of course. It's a huge game.

01:42.306 --> 01:43.690
Yup. But, uh...

01:43.724 --> 01:45.692
Wait,
you find it so unbelievable

01:45.726 --> 01:47.276
that I'm a sports fan?

01:48.829 --> 01:50.980
Certainly I'll be watching.

01:51.031 --> 01:52.431
The pageantry,

01:52.449 --> 01:55.018
the struggle,
the victory and defeat.

01:55.052 --> 01:57.870
A sport is a link
to our tribal past.

01:59.356 --> 02:01.290
I'm surprised you're not
more interested.

02:01.325 --> 02:03.993
For me, every game
could go either way.

02:04.044 --> 02:07.497
So, it's kind
of hard to...

02:07.548 --> 02:11.084
Keep track or
care any more.

02:11.118 --> 02:12.919
And here
we are in the forth quarter,

02:12.953 --> 02:14.253
ten seconds left on the clock.

02:14.287 --> 02:17.223
The kicker's lining up,
the ball is in motion.

02:19.009 --> 02:20.259
The kick is no good!
Los Angeles has won!

02:26.316 --> 02:28.684
Los Angeles has won
the game come on, Britten!

02:28.736 --> 02:31.154
With just ten seconds left.
Come on!

02:31.188 --> 02:33.606
...An easy kick.
L.A. wins over Seattle.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.241
What an excit...

02:38.912 --> 02:40.613
And here
we are in the fourth quarter,

02:40.647 --> 02:42.415
ten seconds left on the clock.

02:42.449 --> 02:44.784
The kicker is lining up,

02:44.818 --> 02:47.453
and the kick sails
right through the uprights.

02:47.487 --> 02:49.756
Seattle has pulled out
the victory over Los Angeles.

02:49.790 --> 02:52.592
Yes!

02:52.626 --> 02:54.761
...stunned Los Angeles team...

02:54.795 --> 02:56.345
<i>In one world, the field goal</i>

02:56.380 --> 02:58.131
<i>misses by inches,</i>
<i>in the other, it's good.</i>

02:58.165 --> 03:00.383
- Bulldogs suck! Yeah, you.
- That's right.

03:00.434 --> 03:03.669
It all just feels so arbitrary.

03:03.687 --> 03:05.605
I'll remember you.

03:10.644 --> 03:12.645
Is everything okay?

03:12.679 --> 03:15.281
Yes, fine.

03:19.953 --> 03:24.991
Frankly, now that I can see how
easily it can go either way,

03:25.025 --> 03:28.077
<i>I wonder why we get so wrapped</i>
<i>up in it to start with.</i>

03:33.050 --> 03:35.168
<i>I mean, when you really</i>
<i>think about it,</i>

03:35.202 --> 03:38.370
<i>does it ever really matter</i>
<i>who wins or loses?</i>

03:40.808 --> 03:42.508
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

03:42.542 --> 03:44.277
<i>I'm awake with my
wife, and I close my eyes,</i>

03:44.311 --> 03:46.846
<i>I open them,</i>
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

03:46.880 --> 03:49.849
And this has been happening
since the accident?

03:51.568 --> 03:53.519
<i>So you begin working on one case</i>

03:53.553 --> 03:55.822
<i>here in reality,</i>
<i>and then suddenly</i>

03:55.856 --> 03:59.025
<i>you begin working another case</i>
<i>there in your dream.</i>

03:59.059 --> 04:01.277
<i>It all feels
completely real to me.</i>

04:01.328 --> 04:03.362
<i>You can't tell whether
you're awake or asleep</i>

04:03.396 --> 04:04.464
at this very moment?

04:04.498 --> 04:05.731
<i>Well, I can assure you,</i>

04:05.749 --> 04:07.416
Detective Britten,
this is not a dream.

04:07.451 --> 04:10.052
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.893

Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

04:18.771 --> 04:21.370
When was the last time
when you saw your brother?

04:21.398 --> 04:22.666
What?

04:22.701 --> 04:24.268
Your brother...

04:24.303 --> 04:27.588
Just bef... just before
I went to go get the car.

04:27.606 --> 04:30.942
We parked far away
and, you know,

04:30.976 --> 04:34.562
and, with the cast
Rob was so slow, and so...

04:34.596 --> 04:37.064
You know, I left him
at the entrance.

04:37.098 --> 04:38.950
When I came back, he
wasn't there, you know.

04:38.984 --> 04:40.201
I looked for like

04:40.235 --> 04:42.737
a half hour or so and...

04:42.771 --> 04:45.406
Then I called
security and, uh,

04:45.440 --> 04:47.658
and, uh...

04:50.796 --> 04:52.112
Yeah, I-I...

04:52.130 --> 04:53.581
I guess I shouldn't be
that surprised.

04:53.615 --> 04:55.499
What does that mean?

04:55.551 --> 04:58.169
Rob, you know, he's...

04:58.220 --> 04:59.954
He's always getting
into fights,

04:59.972 --> 05:02.340
especially after a few beers.

05:02.391 --> 05:03.791
I mean, he didn't
listen to anyone.

05:03.809 --> 05:05.726
And who did he get into it
with today?

05:05.761 --> 05:07.895
I don't... everybody.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.848
I mean, you know, he spent just
as much time screaming at the

05:10.899 --> 05:13.901
people in the stands as he did
the players on the field.

05:18.073 --> 05:20.274
Still, I never imagined, uh...

05:20.308 --> 05:22.577
Where were you guys sitting?

05:25.981 --> 05:27.365
G20.

05:27.416 --> 05:29.417
- Can I keep that?
- Yeah.

05:29.451 --> 05:32.770
All right, we're going to pull together
some of people who were sitting around you,

05:32.771 --> 05:34.192
might have gotten into it with Rob.

05:34.193 --> 05:37.008
You think you'd be
able to identify them?

05:37.042 --> 05:38.709
I don't know.

05:38.744 --> 05:42.496
Like I said, you know, it wasn't
like one particular guy.

05:42.514 --> 05:44.799
Rob was sort of a walking brawl.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.267
We have to start somewhere.

05:46.301 --> 05:47.635
So we'll arrange
accommodations for you

05:47.669 --> 05:48.853
for the next
couple of nights.

05:48.887 --> 05:50.972
Then when we have something
for you to look at,

05:51.006 --> 05:52.306
we'll call you in,
is that all right?

05:52.340 --> 05:53.975
All right, officer Harbin
will take care you.

05:54.009 --> 05:55.893
Officer?

05:55.944 --> 05:57.862
Thank you very much.

05:59.231 --> 06:01.148
You really have to
piss somebody off

06:01.182 --> 06:03.067
to get them to cave
in half your skull.

06:03.118 --> 06:05.953
Sounds like he specialized
in pissing people off.

06:05.988 --> 06:08.122
Wonder what
broke his leg.

06:12.911 --> 06:15.129
Look at this.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.167
Look at the green on his ear.

06:20.201 --> 06:21.752
Somebody left some decoration.

06:21.803 --> 06:24.505
- Home team colors.
- Great.

06:34.766 --> 06:37.652
Rex, come on.
I got dinner downstairs.

06:38.804 --> 06:41.155
Rex, come on.
Let's go.

06:41.189 --> 06:42.940
I'm not hungry.

06:42.991 --> 06:45.076
I know you don't want
to hear this right now

06:45.110 --> 06:47.194
but you have to trust me.

06:47.228 --> 06:49.830
There will be other girls.

06:52.233 --> 06:54.035
Who said this
was about a girl?

06:54.069 --> 06:56.587
Nobody lies in bed all day
listening to depressing music

06:56.621 --> 06:58.005
because they have
a stomach cramp.

07:00.792 --> 07:03.243
I'm a Detective.
I know when people are lying.

07:05.297 --> 07:06.864
Then why'd you
let me stay home?

07:06.898 --> 07:10.101
I've wanted the occasional day
in bed myself.

07:10.135 --> 07:12.887
But you get one free pass
and this is it.

07:12.921 --> 07:15.806
Tomorrow morning,
you're back at school on time.

07:15.857 --> 07:18.693
You understand?

07:19.728 --> 07:22.063
All right, move over.

07:29.437 --> 07:32.490
All right,

07:32.541 --> 07:33.908
you want to talk about it?

07:33.942 --> 07:36.243
What?

07:36.277 --> 07:39.764
What, I don't know,
whatever happened with Emma.

07:41.266 --> 07:45.169
I think I just need
some more time to myself.

07:47.005 --> 07:48.455
Okay.

07:48.473 --> 07:51.759
I got to go to work
for a few hours anyway.

07:51.793 --> 07:53.677
So there's food on the counter
if you need it.

07:56.064 --> 07:57.648
Hang in there, kiddo.

07:57.682 --> 07:59.116
It's going to be okay.

08:01.153 --> 08:03.320
I'll see you later.

08:29.831 --> 08:32.099
It's Emma.
Leave me a message.

08:35.336 --> 08:37.520
Emma...

08:37.556 --> 08:39.306
Come on.

08:39.340 --> 08:42.860
Just call me back, text me,
something.

08:46.782 --> 08:49.850
This place went
up really quickly.

08:49.868 --> 08:52.186
The dry cleaning chemicals
are very flammable.

08:52.204 --> 08:55.189
Victim appears to have died
of smoke inhalation.

08:59.360 --> 09:02.463
Got her name... Sabina Fernandez.

09:02.497 --> 09:04.081
Her neighbor said, uh,
she worked here.

09:04.132 --> 09:06.834
So we don't think she
could have started this fire?

09:06.868 --> 09:08.202
No, it was
definitely arson.

09:08.220 --> 09:09.536
Someone played
with the fuse box,

09:09.554 --> 09:11.305
tried to make it
look like a short.

09:11.339 --> 09:13.674
We recovered a piece
of plastic tubing

09:13.708 --> 09:14.875
that contained some
sort of accelerant.

09:14.893 --> 09:16.427
We'll run a chemical
analysis, let you know

09:16.478 --> 09:18.896
if we find anything that might
tell us where it came from.

09:18.930 --> 09:20.481
All right. Thanks.

09:23.185 --> 09:24.485
So what's our next move?

09:24.519 --> 09:27.521
Well,
you tell me.

09:27.555 --> 09:30.991
Well, uh, we check the streets
for security cameras, ATMs,

09:31.026 --> 09:32.526
any video from
the time of the fire.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.862
Yeah, and then?

09:34.896 --> 09:37.615
Well, then we interview
the victim's family and friends,

09:37.666 --> 09:39.399
see if anyone
wanted to hurt her.

09:39.417 --> 09:40.751
Like boyfriends,
husbands...

09:40.785 --> 09:43.037
Come on, she's living alone
in the back of a cleaners.

09:43.071 --> 09:44.672
If you wanted to
kill someone like this,

09:44.706 --> 09:47.007
you go to the trouble of setting
a fake electrical fire?

09:47.042 --> 09:49.043
She's not the target.

09:49.077 --> 09:50.845
She's just unlucky.

09:52.764 --> 09:54.298
So, an insurance job?

09:54.349 --> 09:58.085
Sometimes, if it looks like a
duck and it quacks like a duck,

09:58.103 --> 10:00.688
it's the guy
with the big knife.

10:00.722 --> 10:02.473
- The owner.
- Yeah.

10:02.524 --> 10:04.975
What do we have here?

10:06.261 --> 10:08.195
There's a possible
reason why.

10:08.230 --> 10:09.813
What do you see here?

10:09.865 --> 10:11.365
A lot of red numbers.

10:11.399 --> 10:13.767
They're bets.

10:13.785 --> 10:15.602
Look, it's a ledger.

10:15.620 --> 10:18.105
And you don't write things down
in red when you're winning.

10:18.123 --> 10:19.657
How much do you
think he owes?

10:19.708 --> 10:21.158
I don't know.

10:21.209 --> 10:23.944
Hello. Look that this.

10:23.962 --> 10:27.047
Last bet, Seattle over L.A.,
100 grand.

10:27.082 --> 10:29.550
Well, if he would have bet on
L.A., she'd still be alive

10:29.584 --> 10:31.385
and we'd both still
be home right now.

10:31.419 --> 10:33.220
I don't know.

10:36.474 --> 10:39.459
I have a feeling which ever way
the game went,

10:39.477 --> 10:42.897
we'd still be working
a case somewhere.

10:50.719 --> 10:54.689
So, uh, you haven't
said anything,

10:54.723 --> 10:58.226
and I haven't
brought it up.

10:58.277 --> 11:02.247
The calendar says that
your last day is coming up soon.

11:02.446 --> 11:04.080
That's when the
movers are coming.

11:04.114 --> 11:06.249
I'll be around; I'll
close this case out.

11:06.283 --> 11:09.419
And then what? You're just
gonna pack up your desk and go?

11:09.453 --> 11:11.087
And leave without
saying good-bye?

11:11.121 --> 11:13.389
I'm not huge
on good-byes.

11:13.424 --> 11:16.292
So what if me and some of the
guys put something together?

11:16.310 --> 11:17.793
What do mean,
"put something together"?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.395
Well, after all the time

11:19.430 --> 11:21.981
you spent on the job,
the least we can do

11:22.016 --> 11:23.983
is take over a bar, give
you a proper send-off.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.303
Maybe.

11:27.321 --> 11:30.239
Is that like a
"yes" maybe or...?

11:30.274 --> 11:32.275
Sure, fine.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.161
Good evening.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.363
Detective Britten
and Detective Vega. LAPD.

11:37.414 --> 11:39.248
We're looking for John Koh.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.339
Sabina was part of our family.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.992
She worked for us
for the last seven years.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.178
She opened the store
every morning.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.131
She was always
the last one to leave.

11:55.165 --> 11:56.849
But she never gave
you any indication

11:56.884 --> 11:58.634
that she was staying
at the property?

11:58.669 --> 12:02.488
No, she...
She was a private person.

12:02.523 --> 12:04.807
Mrs. Koh, could we have
a few minutes alone

12:04.841 --> 12:05.992
with your husband, please?

12:07.177 --> 12:09.629
We'll be taking a
statement from you, too.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.680
Thank you.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.556
How do you think
this could've happened?

12:22.576 --> 12:25.528
I... caught some
neighborhood kids

12:25.562 --> 12:27.530
vandalizing the store once.

12:27.548 --> 12:29.832
Had to call
the police on them.

12:29.866 --> 12:32.668
You think they would have
done this on purpose?

12:32.702 --> 12:36.556
No, I suppose not.

12:37.708 --> 12:40.126
Are you insured?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.477
Yes, of course.

12:41.512 --> 12:42.995
For how much?

12:43.030 --> 12:45.681
A million.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.991
You recognize that
ledger, Mr. Koh?

12:57.111 --> 12:59.395
How much did you owe?

13:01.582 --> 13:04.834
How much does he
owe, Detective?

13:04.868 --> 13:08.571
$487,000.

13:08.589 --> 13:10.923
That's also a
lot of money.

13:10.958 --> 13:15.094
Detectives, I'm telling you...

13:15.129 --> 13:17.797
Miss Fernandez's death makes
this a felony murder case.

13:17.848 --> 13:20.216
And we know the fire
was no accident.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.617
Now, here's what
I think happened.

13:21.652 --> 13:23.586
I think you got
yourself in trouble,

13:23.620 --> 13:25.421
you dug yourself
a deeper and deeper hole

13:25.439 --> 13:26.839
and you panicked.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.575
You had no idea miss
Fernandez was living there,

13:29.610 --> 13:31.394
and you went for
the insurance money.

13:31.428 --> 13:35.731
No, I swear to you, I had...
nothing to do with this.

13:35.765 --> 13:37.400
Look.

13:37.434 --> 13:39.485
I'll take a lie detector test.
All right?

13:39.536 --> 13:41.437
If that,
if that's what you need.

13:41.455 --> 13:43.856
- We can arrange that.
- All right, good.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.241
I'll do whatever it takes

13:45.275 --> 13:49.278
to prove to you that
I didn't do this.

13:49.296 --> 13:52.781
Let's assume for a second
that you're telling the truth.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.251
Somebody wanted
that insurance money.

13:55.285 --> 13:58.471
So who do you owe?

14:02.509 --> 14:05.094
I can't.

14:05.128 --> 14:08.915
You're scared?

14:08.949 --> 14:11.133
Can you imagine
how scared Sabina was

14:11.151 --> 14:14.904
trapped inside a burning building
she couldn't escape from?

14:14.938 --> 14:17.073
This person you described
as a family member.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.941
Now, let me ask you again.

14:18.975 --> 14:21.580
Who do you owe?

14:24.814 --> 14:26.649
- Solomon Kang?
- Yeah. What is this?

14:26.667 --> 14:28.817
We have a warrant
to search your premise

14:28.836 --> 14:31.170
in connection with the fire
at Koh's Imperial Cleaners.

14:34.157 --> 14:35.658
Don't know nothing
about that.

14:35.676 --> 14:37.760
- Do you have any weapons on you?
- No.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.961
Mind if we pat you down?

14:40.964 --> 14:43.499
You got the wrong guy.

14:43.517 --> 14:47.687
Yeah. The guy who did this
left traces of an accelerant.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.004
Turned out
to be nitromethane,

14:49.022 --> 14:50.839
which is a fuel
used for tuner cars.

14:50.858 --> 14:52.942
Well, you knew that 'cause
you manufacture it right here.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.445
Come on, man, I sell that stuff
to anyone who comes in here.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.030
You arrest me, you might
as well arrest everyone

14:58.065 --> 14:59.482
with a souped-up ricer
in L.A. County.

14:59.516 --> 15:01.517
I don't think that they all
take bets from John Koh

15:01.535 --> 15:03.686
and I'm sure that they
did not break his arm.

15:03.704 --> 15:06.656
Look, I'm telling you,
I didn't torch his place.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.708
It's not my style.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.828
Look, we're talking
about reasonable doubt.

15:12.862 --> 15:14.463
Unless you put him
on the scene,

15:14.498 --> 15:16.382
we don't have enough
to make the case stick.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.501
For all you know, he didn't
actually do it himself.

15:18.535 --> 15:20.703
He may have sent
one of his guys.

15:20.721 --> 15:22.855
Well, what do we
do with him now?

15:22.890 --> 15:24.340
Well, then we'll file
for the illegal gambling.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.225
While we hold him we'll
see what we can find.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.727
Don't get more,

15:27.761 --> 15:29.645
it'll get plead down
to a misdemeanor.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.380
Yeah, but the
fuel from his shop

15:31.398 --> 15:33.065
started the fire.
Now the lab says

15:33.100 --> 15:34.984
the chemical signatures
are identical.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.819
It's practically a fingerprint.
But Kang told us

15:36.853 --> 15:38.988
a lot of people
had access to the fuel.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.274
Figure out how it got
from point a to point B.

15:41.325 --> 15:42.658
Until then...

15:42.693 --> 15:45.060
You caught a bookie
not a murderer.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.829
- Thanks, Marco.
- Yeah.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.564
Let's pull the tapes
from the store

15:48.582 --> 15:49.665
up the street from the cleaners.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.667
But there's no
angle on the cleaners.

15:51.702 --> 15:53.068
- It's just traffic going by.
- Yeah.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.337
That's what I want to see.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.671
Why?

15:55.706 --> 15:57.757
Kang's got a tuner
car place, right?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.175
Blends his own fuel.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.794
What do you think his
boys drive, Buicks?

16:07.917 --> 16:09.218
There.

16:09.252 --> 16:10.252
That one.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.389
That's about
the right time frame.

16:13.423 --> 16:14.857
Yeah.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.142
All right.

16:16.193 --> 16:18.194
Can we get a plate on it?

16:19.930 --> 16:21.564
No.

16:21.598 --> 16:23.983
He just zips
right by in profile.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.068
- This is it.
- All right.

16:26.102 --> 16:27.820
Let's print it out.

16:27.871 --> 16:31.574
Custom paint job like that
is almost as good as a plate.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.049
Let's get patrol

16:40.083 --> 16:41.417
to start looking for it.

16:41.451 --> 16:43.669
Put together a list
of everyone in Koreatown

16:43.720 --> 16:46.455
that does custom paint jobs
on tuner cars.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.623
Where you going?

16:47.641 --> 16:49.725
Home to bed.
It's 1:00 A.M.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.645
Don't you think
I'd like some sleep, too?

16:55.265 --> 16:57.516
Fair enough.

16:58.635 --> 17:01.687
Dad. Dad.

17:08.494 --> 17:11.163
What's going on?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.648
Emma's lying to me.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.444
There's no way she broke up with me

17:15.445 --> 17:18.037
because she caught me
staring at Cassie Andersen.

17:18.088 --> 17:19.538
Right.

17:19.589 --> 17:22.040
How do I give her
one of those polygraph things?

17:23.093 --> 17:25.211
Well,

17:25.262 --> 17:29.181
Giving your ex-girlfriend
a polygraph

17:29.216 --> 17:31.300
is not one of your better ideas.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.471
There's something
she's not telling me.

17:36.506 --> 17:38.474
You said you
could tell...

17:38.508 --> 17:41.310
When someone's lying.
How do you do it?

17:42.612 --> 17:44.363
Son...

17:44.398 --> 17:46.132
Seriously, how do you know?

17:50.037 --> 17:52.071
Well...

17:52.122 --> 17:54.990
Liars tend to, uh,
stiffen up.

17:55.024 --> 17:56.826
You know, their body language,

17:56.860 --> 17:58.878
their arms and feet become,

17:58.912 --> 18:00.579
their movements
become minimal.

18:00.630 --> 18:02.465
They cross their arms
or they...

18:02.499 --> 18:04.216
Touch their nose
or their throat.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.885
They'll avoid eye contact.

18:05.919 --> 18:09.255
They generally
get defensive.

18:09.306 --> 18:10.706
You know, if you're
telling the truth

18:10.724 --> 18:12.174
you're on the offensive.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.543
Okay.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.145
Yeah, thanks,
this is good...

18:16.179 --> 18:17.763
H-hold on.

18:17.814 --> 18:20.066
W-wait a second.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.884
Before you go off

18:21.902 --> 18:24.403
conducting an interrogation
into a breakup,

18:24.438 --> 18:26.722
can I ask you...

18:26.740 --> 18:29.191
What do you hope to find?

18:29.225 --> 18:32.611
I just want her
to tell me the truth.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.454
Yeah. No, hold on. Rex!

18:41.505 --> 18:42.922
Hold on!

18:42.956 --> 18:43.923
I'll see you tonight.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.207
Man, what's going on?

18:45.241 --> 18:47.760
You don't want to know.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.578
All right, what's up?

18:49.596 --> 18:50.880
I think we might've got lucky.

18:50.914 --> 18:52.748
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a motorcycle cop

18:52.766 --> 18:56.552
spotted a car in a ditch
this morning about 7:00 A.M.,

18:56.586 --> 18:58.771
and the driver
was passed out in the airbag.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.389
I don't know how long
he was here,

19:00.423 --> 19:01.807
but it did not sober him up.

19:01.858 --> 19:04.810
He still blew a .28
on the breathalyzer.

19:04.861 --> 19:06.946
So you got a drunk guy
in a ditch.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.114
Why is he our guy?

19:08.148 --> 19:09.532
Well, his license
matches the name

19:09.566 --> 19:12.100
on the season ticket holder
manifest for G20.

19:12.119 --> 19:13.502
Was he even at the game?

19:13.537 --> 19:16.122
Well, the odds
are pretty good on that one.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.760
Keep the wheel of car as you ****

19:25.115 --> 19:26.398
Be right back
with the cones, and, uh,

19:26.432 --> 19:27.566
we'll do some parallel parking.

19:28.054 --> 19:30.022
Okay.

19:45.066 --> 19:47.419
First you skip homeroom, then
you don't answer my calls.

19:47.485 --> 19:48.935
Why won't you talk to me?

19:48.986 --> 19:51.404
You know why.

19:51.439 --> 19:53.189
There's no way you
broke up with me because...

19:53.224 --> 19:54.657
You saw me talking
to Cassie Andersen.

19:54.692 --> 19:58.194
- You stare at her all the time.
- Everyone looks at her.

19:58.228 --> 20:00.697
She's gorgeous and she dresses
like she's in a rap video.

20:00.731 --> 20:02.749
- Rex...
- Please.

20:02.783 --> 20:04.667
Tell me to my face
that you dumped me

20:04.702 --> 20:06.920
because you saw me
looking at Cassie Andersen.

20:09.406 --> 20:11.641
Is that really why?

20:12.843 --> 20:14.377
Yes.

20:14.411 --> 20:15.979
You're lying.

20:16.013 --> 20:17.246
- No, I'm not.
- You did it again.

20:17.264 --> 20:18.264
Did what?

20:18.299 --> 20:19.449
Lied to me.

20:19.483 --> 20:20.315
How do you know?!

20:20.316 --> 20:23.252
Does it matter how I know?
What matters is that I'm right,

20:23.270 --> 20:24.637
and we both know it.

20:29.310 --> 20:30.693
Emma!

20:30.728 --> 20:33.029
Emma, what are you doing?
You won't even talk to me.

20:33.063 --> 20:34.096
Emma, please!

20:34.114 --> 20:36.282
I don't want to
talk about it!

20:36.317 --> 20:39.174
And trust me, you don't want to know.

20:39.175 --> 20:40.487
Trust me, I do.

20:42.289 --> 20:44.073
Please just tell me
the truth and I swear

20:44.107 --> 20:45.909
I'll leave you alone.

20:51.999 --> 20:54.617
I don't know.

20:54.635 --> 20:57.119
Well, he was painted green.

20:57.137 --> 20:59.589
And since your brother
had traces of green paint

20:59.623 --> 21:01.791
on his body, we were curious
if maybe...

21:01.809 --> 21:03.593
He got into a fight
with somebody

21:03.627 --> 21:05.345
who was painted green.

21:05.396 --> 21:08.314
Yeah, there was this L.A. fan
who did the whole green thing.

21:08.349 --> 21:10.466
You know, my brother
got in this guy's face,

21:10.484 --> 21:12.235
they start
shoving each other...

21:12.269 --> 21:13.987
They threw a few punches,

21:14.021 --> 21:16.940
but security
broke it up really fast.

21:16.974 --> 21:19.141
Does that look like the guy?

21:19.159 --> 21:22.662
I mean, I didn't really
get a good look at him.

21:22.696 --> 21:25.849
I mean,
he was green.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.602
Okay. Thanks.

21:29.637 --> 21:31.487
What do you
do for a job, George?

21:31.505 --> 21:33.373
I'm an investment banker.

21:33.424 --> 21:35.008
No wonder our country's
going in the toilet.

21:35.042 --> 21:38.545
Our people of high finance
are painting themselves green.

21:38.596 --> 21:41.881
Who did you go
to the game with?

21:41.932 --> 21:44.434
With some buddies
from college.

21:44.468 --> 21:47.353
It's why I had
the green paint on.

21:47.388 --> 21:49.355
It's kind of a tradition,
an alumni thing.

21:49.390 --> 21:51.808
Look, guys,

21:51.842 --> 21:53.393
what's going on?

21:53.444 --> 21:56.563
It's a little overkill
for a dui, right?

21:57.865 --> 21:59.015
Is it?

22:04.738 --> 22:07.574
Recognize this guy?

22:07.608 --> 22:08.825
No.

22:08.859 --> 22:10.326
Take a good look.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.579
His name is Robert Jones.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.963
Never seen him.

22:13.998 --> 22:15.698
Funny.

22:15.716 --> 22:17.116
When I get in a fight,

22:17.151 --> 22:19.752
the guy I'm fighting with
usually makes an impression.

22:19.803 --> 22:23.372
Don't tell me
he's pressing charges.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.893
So, you do remember him.

22:26.927 --> 22:28.895
We got into it in the stands.

22:28.929 --> 22:30.346
It was no big deal.

22:30.380 --> 22:31.564
No big deal.

22:31.599 --> 22:33.016
No.

22:33.050 --> 22:35.018
What?

22:35.052 --> 22:37.219
He didn't humiliate you?

22:37.237 --> 22:40.106
In front of your friends?
In front of your banker buddies?

22:40.157 --> 22:41.557
- Your college buddies?
- No.

22:41.575 --> 22:44.611
What happened?
You put him down?

22:44.662 --> 22:46.946
Did he put you down?
Punch each other?

22:46.997 --> 22:48.397
You scratch each other?
Pull each other's hair?

22:48.415 --> 22:49.565
What was it, George?

22:49.583 --> 22:51.985
Did you follow him
outside, George?

22:52.019 --> 22:53.920
No.

22:53.954 --> 22:55.538
See, the good news is,

22:55.572 --> 22:57.457
he won't be pressing charges.

22:57.508 --> 22:59.876
The bad news is,

22:59.910 --> 23:01.911
he was found beaten
to death in the parking lot.

23:01.929 --> 23:03.596
What?

23:03.631 --> 23:05.915
Those are some ugly bruises
on your knuckles there, George.

23:05.933 --> 23:08.551
And the blood on your shirt...
Where's that from?

23:13.807 --> 23:14.941
Wait. You...

23:14.975 --> 23:17.477
You guys think I had something
to do with this?

23:17.511 --> 23:19.395
We're just trying
to work out how it went

23:19.429 --> 23:20.780
from a fistfight in the stands

23:20.814 --> 23:22.398
to a dead guy
in the parking lot,

23:22.432 --> 23:24.734
and you passed out a couple
of miles away in a ditch

23:24.768 --> 23:26.736
with a blood alcohol level
three times the legal limit.

23:27.770 --> 23:29.789
It looks to us

23:29.823 --> 23:30.957
a lot like you were trying

23:30.991 --> 23:32.408
to leave the stadium
in a real hurry.

23:32.442 --> 23:34.410
No. No.

23:34.444 --> 23:36.496
I,

23:39.717 --> 23:42.301
No? Okay, tell us
what happened, George.

23:43.337 --> 23:45.838
I can't.

23:45.889 --> 23:47.507
You... can't?

23:47.558 --> 23:49.642
Why is that?

23:49.677 --> 23:52.645
I don't remember.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.631
You don't remember?

23:55.649 --> 23:57.684
That's what
you're going with?

23:57.735 --> 23:59.519
I mean, seriously.

23:59.570 --> 24:01.904
The amnesia's not the
great legal smoke screen

24:01.939 --> 24:03.639
you might think
it is, George.

24:03.657 --> 24:05.975
You have to come up
with an actual story.

24:05.993 --> 24:08.244
Look, I was hammered.

24:08.278 --> 24:10.780
Blacked out drunk.

24:10.814 --> 24:12.448
But I wouldn't
kill someone

24:12.483 --> 24:14.483
just 'cause L.A. lost.

24:21.875 --> 24:23.626
You packing or reading?

24:23.660 --> 24:24.794
Movers are
coming tomorrow.

24:24.828 --> 24:26.012
Just reading up about
yesterday's game

24:26.046 --> 24:27.630
so I don't embarrass myself
in front of

24:27.664 --> 24:29.849
the guys at work.

24:29.883 --> 24:32.835
I tell you Vega's organizing
a going-away party for me?

24:34.855 --> 24:37.339
- I'm amazed you agreed to go.
- Why?

24:37.357 --> 24:39.942
'Cause I just know how you hate
being the center of attention.

24:39.977 --> 24:41.477
He's like a
little puppy dog.

24:41.511 --> 24:43.312
I didn't want to
hurt his feelings.

24:45.899 --> 24:48.868
Your ears must
have been burning.

24:48.902 --> 24:51.687
I don't know about my ears,
but my eyes are pretty tired.

24:51.705 --> 24:52.955
I got two hours of sleep.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.523
But I had patrol hit up

24:54.541 --> 24:56.325
every paint and body shop
in Koreatown,

24:56.359 --> 24:58.861
and finally found the one
that painted the tuner car

24:58.879 --> 25:00.246
that we were looking for.

25:00.297 --> 25:04.033
Well, it's registered to
a Korean kid named Jinsung do.

25:04.051 --> 25:06.702
Got some priors...
One for gun possession.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.055
Got dropped to a misdemeanor
because he's a minor.

25:09.089 --> 25:11.040
- Any connection with Kang?
- Yeah.

25:11.058 --> 25:12.892
He's one of Kang's runners.

25:12.926 --> 25:14.160
Can we go talk to him?

25:14.194 --> 25:15.544
All right, I'm about
to leave the station.

25:15.562 --> 25:17.163
- Want me to pick you up?
- Where does he live?

25:17.197 --> 25:19.682
Koreatown...
With his grandmother.

25:28.225 --> 25:30.226
Hello?

25:30.244 --> 25:33.896
LAPD. Is Jinsung Do home?

25:36.283 --> 25:38.417
Ma'am, I understand you want
to protect your grandson,

25:38.452 --> 25:39.786
but we have a warrant
for his arrest,

25:39.837 --> 25:40.953
so if you want him to be safe,

25:41.004 --> 25:43.005
I need you to open this door
now.

25:55.969 --> 25:57.103
Clear.

25:58.138 --> 26:00.139
Clear.

26:04.561 --> 26:05.594
He's running.

26:05.612 --> 26:07.063
Take the back.

26:13.403 --> 26:14.770
Stop!

26:14.788 --> 26:16.322
Stop!

26:24.114 --> 26:24.780
Stop!

27:00.304 --> 27:02.124
This kid has the shoot girls.

27:02.163 --> 27:03.881
Yeah, 8:00.

27:03.932 --> 27:06.500
If we had the whole place,
it's going down.

27:06.518 --> 27:08.769
All right.

27:08.804 --> 27:10.187
That was Danny.

27:10.222 --> 27:11.806
Danny evidence,
Danny Motor Pool?

27:11.840 --> 27:15.059
Evidence. Says his sister works
at this restaurant in Hollywood,

27:15.093 --> 27:16.327
has this amazing
roof deck.

27:16.361 --> 27:19.063
Says she's gonna give us
a deal to rent it out

27:19.097 --> 27:20.648
tomorrow night for the party.

27:22.183 --> 27:25.236
Mechanical bull.
Does it sound like fun?

27:25.287 --> 27:26.804
Sure.

27:26.838 --> 27:29.123
Dr. Brand to cardiology.

27:29.157 --> 27:30.991
You keep staring at that thing

27:31.025 --> 27:33.077
like it's gonna
tell you something.

27:33.128 --> 27:34.695
Detectives?

27:34.713 --> 27:35.863
He's got a few
broken ribs

27:35.881 --> 27:39.133
and a subdural hematoma,
but he's stable.

27:39.167 --> 27:41.201
- Can we interview him?
- Yeah.

27:41.219 --> 27:42.369
Just keep it short.

27:42.387 --> 27:45.306
Thanks.

27:50.512 --> 27:53.597
Jinsung,
remember us?

27:53.648 --> 27:56.066
We have enough evidence
linking you to the fire

27:56.101 --> 27:57.818
that killed
Sabina Fernandez,

27:57.853 --> 27:59.837
with a secure
conviction for murder.

27:59.871 --> 28:03.641
Now, you're a juvie, but you'll
get tried as an adult, so,

28:03.675 --> 28:07.478
that's gonna get you 25 to
life, or a death sentence.

28:07.512 --> 28:09.880
So this is a
serious conversation.

28:09.915 --> 28:13.651
It may be your last chance to
do something good for yourself

28:13.685 --> 28:15.886
for a long, long time.

28:15.921 --> 28:19.790
Now, I don't think
you acted alone,

28:19.841 --> 28:22.743
and I'd like to be able to tell
the D.A. that you cooperated.

28:22.777 --> 28:24.712
And maybe he'll
go easy on you.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.198
But you have to tell me
who hired you.

28:27.232 --> 28:28.816
And don't worry
about Kang trying

28:28.850 --> 28:30.684
to hurt you
or your grandmother.

28:30.719 --> 28:33.220
He's not gonna be able
to touch you from prison.

28:33.254 --> 28:35.222
This is your last chance

28:35.256 --> 28:37.691
to help yourself.

28:39.728 --> 28:42.530
Kang's not the one
who hired me.

28:43.548 --> 28:45.933
No?

28:45.967 --> 28:47.401
No.

28:52.106 --> 28:54.408
Okay, then, who hired you?

28:59.264 --> 29:00.331
It's the police.

29:03.117 --> 29:05.135
Detectives,
please come in.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.387
Thank you.

29:06.421 --> 29:07.955
Can I get you
some tea?

29:07.973 --> 29:10.507
No, we're good.
Thank you.

29:10.559 --> 29:12.593
We have a suspect

29:12.627 --> 29:14.345
in custody who confessed
to setting the fire.

29:14.396 --> 29:15.512
I think you know him.

29:15.564 --> 29:17.130
His name is Jinsung Do.

29:20.151 --> 29:23.320
Kang sends him around every week
to settle my account,

29:23.355 --> 29:24.822
to pay out or collect.

29:24.856 --> 29:26.974
Mostly to collect.

29:26.992 --> 29:29.059
So, you were right
about Kang.

29:29.094 --> 29:31.195
He sent Jinsung
to burn down my store.

29:31.246 --> 29:33.647
Not according to Mr. Do.

29:33.682 --> 29:35.616
But he works for Kang.

29:35.650 --> 29:38.652
But he says he was working
for someone else that night.

29:40.589 --> 29:43.390
You want to tell your husband,
or shall I?

29:43.808 --> 29:46.377
Tell him what?

29:46.411 --> 29:48.612
That you hired Mr. Do
to burn down the store.

29:49.664 --> 29:50.965
Me?

29:50.999 --> 29:52.600
That's crazy.

29:52.634 --> 29:56.854
That you promised him $25,000
of the insurance money.

29:56.888 --> 29:59.840
He's making this up so Kang
doesn't hurt his family.

29:59.858 --> 30:02.393
He's lying!

30:02.444 --> 30:03.560
Is he lying
about the three calls

30:03.612 --> 30:04.979
you made to his cell phone
last week?

30:05.013 --> 30:07.514
Because that's what
the records show.

30:07.549 --> 30:10.517
I understand you were trying to
dig your husband out of trouble,

30:10.535 --> 30:12.853
save the business. I suspect
you did not know Ms. Fernandez

30:12.871 --> 30:15.789
was sleeping on the property,
but I promise you that

30:15.824 --> 30:18.375
lying to us now will only
make things worse for you.

30:18.410 --> 30:21.028
Su Mi?

30:24.582 --> 30:27.134
I begged you to stop,

30:27.168 --> 30:29.586
but you wouldn't listen.

30:29.638 --> 30:32.673
Even when they hurt you,
you wouldn't listen.

30:32.707 --> 30:34.758
What other choice
did I have?

30:34.809 --> 30:37.711
Sabina died in that fire.

30:37.729 --> 30:39.647
And I'm the one who
has to live with that.

30:39.681 --> 30:41.732
If you even
call that living.

30:41.766 --> 30:43.350
- I keep seeing her face...
- Su Mi...

30:43.384 --> 30:44.652
- again and again!
- Ma'am, ma'am.

30:44.686 --> 30:46.053
Stop it!

30:46.071 --> 30:48.238
Mrs. Koh, please don't resist!
Stop it!

30:48.273 --> 30:49.490
We're placing you
under arrest

30:49.524 --> 30:51.575
for the murder
of Sabina Fernandez.

30:51.609 --> 30:53.610
You have the right
to remain silent...

31:22.924 --> 31:24.975
The victim's mom
and surviving son are waiting

31:25.026 --> 31:27.361
to claim the body,
wondering what the holdup is.

31:27.395 --> 31:30.097
Frankly, so am I.

31:30.115 --> 31:32.099
I had to pull this from sid.

31:32.117 --> 31:33.784
Why?

31:33.818 --> 31:36.103
'Cause I think we
have the wrong guy.

31:37.122 --> 31:39.740
I'm listening.

31:39.774 --> 31:43.243
We found this next to his body,
so we assumed it was his, right?

31:43.277 --> 31:44.545
And it's also his team.

31:44.579 --> 31:45.612
Look at him.

31:45.630 --> 31:46.880
Big, beefy guy.

31:46.915 --> 31:48.282
So what?

31:48.316 --> 31:50.167
So, I knew something
was bothering me,

31:50.218 --> 31:52.136
and I realized this
morning what it was.

31:52.170 --> 31:54.588
Put it on him.

32:03.932 --> 32:05.632
- That's no way that's his.
- Okay.

32:05.650 --> 32:09.636
So, if it's not the victim's
hat, whose is it?

32:13.691 --> 32:15.776
Then will you please call
Aunt Sue?

32:15.810 --> 32:17.161
Please call her.

32:17.195 --> 32:18.645
It's not gonna do
any good...

32:18.663 --> 32:19.997
I'll be right back.

32:20.031 --> 32:22.199
Look, guys, I don't know
what's going on, but,

32:22.250 --> 32:25.252
my mother... she's been
through a lot, okay, and,

32:25.286 --> 32:27.287
And I should take her home.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.673
I'm afraid she'll have
a lot more to go through

32:29.707 --> 32:30.924
before the day is over.

32:30.959 --> 32:33.010
You can tell your mother
whatever you want,

32:33.044 --> 32:35.345
but we have
to talk to you

32:35.380 --> 32:36.847
now.

32:52.008 --> 32:53.158
Why am I here?

32:53.248 --> 32:55.516
Why do you think you're here,
Kenneth?

32:55.551 --> 32:56.918
I don't know.

32:56.952 --> 32:57.952
Let me tell you

32:57.986 --> 33:00.805
what Detective Bird here
thinks happened.

33:00.839 --> 33:02.590
We know your brother, Rob,
was violent,

33:02.624 --> 33:04.041
that he got
in everyone's face.

33:04.093 --> 33:06.160
Yeah, I know, I know; I'm
the one who told you that.

33:06.195 --> 33:08.996
Yeah, but you didn't tell us
that he was abusive to you.

33:09.014 --> 33:10.515
We have witnesses
at the stadium

33:10.549 --> 33:12.366
said he was
pushing you around.

33:12.401 --> 33:13.651
That must have been humiliating.

33:13.685 --> 33:15.720
Must have made you feel
small and weak

33:15.771 --> 33:17.221
in front of a crowd like that.

33:18.724 --> 33:20.641
Sure, he-he was hard on me,
but, you know,

33:20.675 --> 33:22.009
that-that's
what big brothers do.

33:23.328 --> 33:25.396
You said you went
to the car afterwards,

33:25.447 --> 33:26.697
you couldn't find it?

33:26.732 --> 33:28.132
I couldn't.

33:28.167 --> 33:30.334
That's not
what we think went down.

33:30.369 --> 33:32.670
Here.

33:32.704 --> 33:35.239
Do me a favor,

33:35.290 --> 33:37.074
and, uh, put that on.

33:45.501 --> 33:48.169
Put it on,
or I'll put it on for you.

33:58.230 --> 34:00.014
It fits, right?

34:00.048 --> 34:02.216
It fits like a glove.

34:03.485 --> 34:05.603
See, we found it next
to your brother's dead body.

34:05.654 --> 34:09.023
After you killed him,

34:09.056 --> 34:11.576
you grabbed the wrong cap.

34:11.610 --> 34:13.411
No.

34:13.445 --> 34:15.163
I have the same hat.

34:15.197 --> 34:17.197
Different sizes.

34:17.232 --> 34:18.699
You took his, you left yours.

34:18.734 --> 34:19.917
Kenneth?

34:19.952 --> 34:22.152
We already pulled
hair samples.

34:22.187 --> 34:23.855
We know you killed
your brother,

34:23.889 --> 34:26.239
and you were going to let
an innocent man take the fall.

34:26.257 --> 34:27.542
Here's the only question left:

34:27.576 --> 34:29.543
What do we tell your mother?

34:29.578 --> 34:33.681
She's outside,
waiting to take Rob's body home.

34:33.715 --> 34:35.149
When this all comes out,

34:35.184 --> 34:36.766
and it will all come out...

34:38.770 --> 34:40.638
...we can tell her one
of two things.

34:40.672 --> 34:43.774
That she raised
a cold-blooded killer.

34:43.809 --> 34:47.661
Or that her son made a mistake.

34:47.696 --> 34:49.197
That he's human.

34:49.231 --> 34:51.065
That he was provoked.

34:51.099 --> 34:53.266
That he was bullied,

34:53.302 --> 34:55.953
and that for once in his life,
he stood up for himself.

34:55.987 --> 34:57.938
I didn't mean to kill him.

34:57.956 --> 35:00.958
Okay? I swear I didn't.

35:03.111 --> 35:04.245
During the whole game,

35:04.279 --> 35:06.297
he kept slapping me
in the back of the head

35:06.331 --> 35:08.249
and calling me a girl

35:08.283 --> 35:09.917
because I wouldn't
stand up for him

35:09.951 --> 35:12.420
during those fights
with the other fans.

35:12.454 --> 35:14.788
And then after...
After the game was done,

35:14.806 --> 35:16.224
it got really bad, you know?

35:16.258 --> 35:18.226
We were... we were walking
back to the car,

35:18.260 --> 35:21.929
and-and-and I told him to stop,
and he wouldn't.

35:21.963 --> 35:24.798
Then he pushed me on the ground,
he got in my face,

35:24.816 --> 35:28.302
and he called me a pussy,
and I-I...

35:28.320 --> 35:31.272
I felt this-this loose brick
underneath me,

35:31.306 --> 35:33.441
and I just... I grabbed it.

35:33.475 --> 35:36.994
And I...

35:41.450 --> 35:42.934
Okay.

35:58.934 --> 36:00.468
Dad.

36:02.437 --> 36:04.171
What are you...
What are you doing here?

36:04.189 --> 36:05.273
Is everything okay?

36:05.307 --> 36:06.941
Can I talk to you?

36:06.975 --> 36:08.693
Yeah, sure.
You want to sit down?

36:08.727 --> 36:10.177
I'll get you a soda
or something?

36:10.195 --> 36:13.531
Is there, like,
someplace more private?

36:15.367 --> 36:18.519
Okay, what's going on?

36:18.553 --> 36:21.622
Dad, I got her pregnant.

36:32.701 --> 36:36.370
How far along is she?

36:36.388 --> 36:38.956
She lost it.

36:42.210 --> 36:43.728
She never told me.

36:43.762 --> 36:45.879
This whole time, I've been
acting like an idiot,

36:45.897 --> 36:48.065
and she's been dealing with
this and the whole thing.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.768
I-I mean...

36:50.819 --> 36:53.237
It-it's all my fault.

36:53.271 --> 36:55.189
Well, you're both responsible.

36:55.223 --> 36:57.942
No, she was always
smart about...

36:57.993 --> 37:00.878
Protection and...

37:00.912 --> 37:03.914
I know when it happened.

37:03.949 --> 37:06.917
In the very beginning,

37:06.952 --> 37:09.086
and I didn't have anything,

37:09.121 --> 37:11.122
and I...

37:11.173 --> 37:13.874
I told her it would be
okay, and she wasn't...

37:13.908 --> 37:15.760
Rex...

37:15.794 --> 37:19.714
She wasn't sure,

37:19.748 --> 37:23.601
and-and I promised her
it would be fine.

37:23.635 --> 37:26.354
And it wasn't.

37:28.757 --> 37:30.758
All right, how is she?

37:33.378 --> 37:35.646
I don't... I don't know.

37:35.697 --> 37:37.615
I mean, she says she's fine,

37:37.649 --> 37:39.950
but she hasn't told anyone.

37:39.985 --> 37:43.537
She's just been
dealing with it alone.

37:46.458 --> 37:49.126
She said she didn't think
I could handle it.

37:49.161 --> 37:51.245
And she was right.

37:51.279 --> 37:52.913
What's wrong with me?

37:52.947 --> 37:53.998
There's nothing wrong with you.

37:54.049 --> 37:55.516
You're a teenager.

37:55.550 --> 37:57.551
You just reacted like one,
that's all.

37:57.586 --> 37:59.136
Don't be too hard on yourself.

37:59.171 --> 38:01.756
How do I fix it?

38:01.790 --> 38:05.393
Well, you have to let her know
that when she needs anything,

38:05.427 --> 38:07.595
if she needs anything,

38:07.629 --> 38:09.230
that you will be there for her.

38:09.264 --> 38:11.549
I can do that.

38:11.583 --> 38:15.135
Let me grab my bag,
and I'll get you home.

38:45.967 --> 38:47.301
<i>Did you watch the game?</i>

38:47.335 --> 38:49.503
They almost won.

38:49.521 --> 38:52.473
There was this one play,

38:52.507 --> 38:55.643
<i>this one field goal,</i>

38:55.677 --> 38:58.679
<i>and it missed by a few inches.</i>

39:00.182 --> 39:04.001
<i>Just that one little thing.</i>

39:04.035 --> 39:06.137
<i>One tiny, little thing,</i>

39:06.171 --> 39:09.356
<i>and this</i>
<i>could all be different.</i>

39:13.044 --> 39:16.080
I just texted her, and she said
she wants to come over.

39:17.466 --> 39:19.032
Listen,

39:19.050 --> 39:21.969
uh, you know how you said
that you knew when it happened?

39:22.003 --> 39:24.188
Back in the beginning?

39:24.222 --> 39:25.473
When was that?

39:25.507 --> 39:27.224
Just before mom died.

39:27.259 --> 39:29.426
Emma said she found out
just after the funeral.

39:29.478 --> 39:31.579
Why?

39:53.702 --> 39:55.202
Where are you going?

39:55.236 --> 39:57.588
I didn't want to wake you.

39:57.622 --> 39:59.740
I got to go out for a while.

39:59.758 --> 40:02.543
The movers are coming up
to start packing today.

40:02.577 --> 40:04.678
I know.

40:04.713 --> 40:06.680
I'll be back.

40:24.699 --> 40:26.433
Emma? Emma?

40:26.451 --> 40:28.118
Hi.

40:28.153 --> 40:29.703
Hi.

40:29.738 --> 40:32.439
I'm, Michael...

40:32.457 --> 40:34.124
Yeah, Mr. Britten, hi.

40:34.159 --> 40:37.110
I-I was at the funeral.

40:38.797 --> 40:39.880
Could we, uh...

40:39.915 --> 40:42.115
I'll catch up
with you guys after.

40:42.133 --> 40:44.835
Bye. See you later.

40:44.886 --> 40:46.670
What are you doing here?

40:50.892 --> 40:52.343
I want to ask you a question,

40:52.394 --> 40:54.962
and it might be completely...

40:54.980 --> 40:58.349
Inappropriate.

41:00.402 --> 41:02.853
Are you...

41:05.991 --> 41:09.526
...by any chance...

41:14.950 --> 41:17.451
H-how did you know?

41:20.922 --> 41:22.623
It's Rex's.

41:29.330 --> 41:32.299
Mr... I-I thought
about calling you,

41:32.333 --> 41:33.801
I just...

41:33.835 --> 41:36.687
It's okay.

41:36.721 --> 41:38.722
It's okay.

41:41.860 --> 41:44.862
It's gonna be okay.

41:54.406 --> 41:57.558
Can you tell them how to get
the ladder up into the attic?

41:57.592 --> 41:59.576
Guys, can you
give us five, please?

42:01.279 --> 42:03.530
Just give us a minute?

42:03.548 --> 42:04.665
Thank you.

42:04.699 --> 42:06.033
What's going on?

42:16.870 --> 42:19.255
There's something
we need to talk about.
