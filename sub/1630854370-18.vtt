00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:20.724 --> 00:23.241
William Mumford
here is a VIP.

00:23.241 --> 00:24.551
Name's Billy.

00:24.551 --> 00:26.448
William always seemed
a little fancy for me.

00:26.448 --> 00:28.827
I'm so sorry Billy.

00:28.827 --> 00:31.517
What a fine citizen to meet
your first day on the job.

00:31.517 --> 00:32.482
Get in.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.172
Oh- easy!

00:33.172 --> 00:34.931
No need to
be so rough.

00:34.931 --> 00:37.586
Oh you precious baby.

00:37.586 --> 00:39.034
You'll live.

00:39.034 --> 00:40.137
More's the pity.

00:40.137 --> 00:40.896
Hands.

00:45.517 --> 00:46.206
Sweet dreams.

00:46.310 --> 00:48.517
I'll make sure
you're in them.

00:48.517 --> 00:49.896
Mmmm.

00:53.862 --> 00:55.000
Oh hey, Hudson.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hey Mallory.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.310
You remember
Rex's favourite catch-

00:57.310 --> 00:59.379
Mr. Mumford?

00:59.379 --> 01:00.724
This is Rawlins.

01:00.724 --> 01:02.241
His first day
with us.

01:02.241 --> 01:02.931
Oh hey Rawlins.

01:02.931 --> 01:03.724
Welcome to the team.

01:06.068 --> 01:07.793
Obviously you've
never seen Rex before.

01:07.793 --> 01:09.517
No, but sure heard
all about him.

01:09.517 --> 01:10.206
Hey, Rex.

01:10.206 --> 01:10.862
That's okay.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.586
You can pet him.

01:11.586 --> 01:12.275
He won't bite.

01:13.379 --> 01:14.275
Yeah?

01:14.482 --> 01:15.793
Rex, say
hi to Ben.

01:15.896 --> 01:17.068
Awww!

01:18.758 --> 01:19.413
Ahh!

01:20.241 --> 01:21.379
Awww!

01:21.379 --> 01:22.103
Who's a good boy?

01:22.103 --> 01:22.758
All right.

01:22.758 --> 01:24.068
Fun's over.

01:24.068 --> 01:25.241
Got to show this
rook around.

01:25.965 --> 01:26.724
Come on Rawlins.

01:27.551 --> 01:28.206
See you.

01:28.206 --> 01:29.000
See you soon.

01:31.827 --> 01:33.586
Still running with that
fleabag eh, Charlie?

01:34.413 --> 01:36.241
You just
don't like him

01:36.241 --> 01:38.172
because he knows what
kind of man you are Billy.

01:38.172 --> 01:39.206
Yeah.

01:39.206 --> 01:41.137
So, last night
on the rock, huh?

01:41.137 --> 01:43.896
Yeah, not certain this is how
I'd choose to spend it but-

01:43.896 --> 01:45.827
Just enjoy it
while you can-

01:45.827 --> 01:47.793
because it's going to be a
fair bit better than Millbrook.

01:47.793 --> 01:50.827
Why are they sending me
to that hellhole anyway?

01:50.827 --> 01:52.310
That's the whole

01:52.310 --> 01:54.137
consequences of
your actions thing.

01:54.137 --> 01:55.310
Right.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.379
But why the
stop off here?

01:57.379 --> 01:59.482
You just want to
give me a pep talk?

01:59.482 --> 02:00.758
No there's trouble
at the airport.

02:00.758 --> 02:01.827
No flights
going in or out.

02:01.827 --> 02:03.482
Trouble?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.344
What kind of trouble?

02:05.344 --> 02:07.034
That's not your concern.

02:08.724 --> 02:10.482
See you in forty
years Billy.

02:12.965 --> 02:15.034
At least your dog
will be dead by then.

02:15.034 --> 02:15.689
So-

02:15.689 --> 02:16.655
that's something.

02:20.482 --> 02:21.448
Let's go, Rex.

02:22.758 --> 02:24.137
Come on partner.

02:37.862 --> 02:38.862
Hey.

02:38.862 --> 02:41.068
He's not the most
pleasant overnight guest.

02:41.068 --> 02:42.448
No, fortunately
it's just for a night.

02:42.448 --> 02:43.862
Then we get a
killer off the island.

02:43.862 --> 02:45.827
Why are we shipping
him out anyway?

02:45.827 --> 02:47.275
Well Halifax
PD wants him.

02:47.275 --> 02:48.965
He's a suspect in
a murder there too.

02:48.965 --> 02:49.862
They want to
question him

02:49.862 --> 02:51.068
before the
Feds take him.

02:51.068 --> 02:52.206
So you think

02:52.206 --> 02:53.758
he's going to spend the
rest of his life behind bars?

02:53.758 --> 02:55.586
This and the
next I'd say.

02:55.586 --> 02:56.793
The next one?

02:57.931 --> 02:59.000
You believe that?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.896
Above my pay
grade, Jesse.

03:03.862 --> 03:05.620
It's quiet in here.

03:06.965 --> 03:09.275
Yeah half the crew are at
the airport looking for a bomb.

03:09.275 --> 03:10.655
The other half are
at the holiday parade.

03:10.655 --> 03:11.379
The holiday parade?

03:11.379 --> 03:12.310
That's right!

03:12.310 --> 03:13.413
I wish I
was there!

03:13.413 --> 03:14.413
Oh really?

03:14.413 --> 03:16.034
You want to go stand
in line to tell Santa

03:16.034 --> 03:16.931
what you want
for Christmas?

03:16.931 --> 03:18.034
Yeah maybe.

03:18.034 --> 03:19.206
Really?

03:19.206 --> 03:21.482
I've got some pent up things
I want to say to that guy.

03:24.172 --> 03:25.068
Okay.

03:28.413 --> 03:29.551
You know what?

03:29.551 --> 03:31.413
I'll settle for
the day of boredom.

03:31.413 --> 03:32.517
Come on pal.

03:44.758 --> 03:45.827
Easy.

03:46.379 --> 03:47.862
We didn't do
nothing wrong.

03:47.862 --> 03:50.103
They have you cited for
public intoxication.

03:50.103 --> 03:51.551
Causing a disturbance.

03:51.551 --> 03:53.103
But, hey, I
wasn't there.

03:53.103 --> 03:53.827
I'm sure you're innocent.

03:53.827 --> 03:54.482
Oh!

03:54.482 --> 03:56.517
A smartass.

03:59.034 --> 04:00.517
Don't put him
in a cell with me.

04:00.517 --> 04:01.482
I don't want
that neither.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.172
Get in.

04:03.172 --> 04:04.068
Which one of us?

04:04.689 --> 04:05.620
You choose!

04:07.689 --> 04:08.931
Get in.

04:08.931 --> 04:10.655
Don't tell me
what to do.

04:10.655 --> 04:11.758
All right, fine!

04:11.758 --> 04:12.965
I don't care!

04:13.862 --> 04:15.482
Whatever happened
to ladies first?

04:15.482 --> 04:17.482
Got to be a lady
to have that happen.

04:18.551 --> 04:19.586
Good one, bro'.

04:19.586 --> 04:21.931
When'd this become
your business?

04:23.724 --> 04:25.413
I'm just making conversation.

04:26.241 --> 04:27.482
Don't.

04:28.965 --> 04:30.482
I don't want to
hear anything from you.

04:30.482 --> 04:31.206
Got it?

04:31.206 --> 04:31.931
All I'm looking for

04:31.931 --> 04:33.689
is a quiet night
in the cells.

04:33.689 --> 04:35.655
Hey, uh-

04:35.655 --> 04:37.241
Hey.

04:38.482 --> 04:40.275
Aren't you the guy that
killed those two kids-

04:40.275 --> 04:41.724
up in Bay Roberts?

04:41.724 --> 04:42.896
Weren't kids.

04:42.896 --> 04:44.034
Grown men.

04:46.931 --> 04:48.310
Still killed them.

04:48.310 --> 04:50.413
That's what they say.

04:50.413 --> 04:51.241
Hey guard.

04:51.241 --> 04:52.517
Look.

04:52.517 --> 04:53.931
It's my last night
on the island.

04:53.931 --> 04:55.103
These two have
to be here?

04:57.448 --> 04:58.068
Enjoy your evening.

05:22.620 --> 05:23.965
Hey did Joe say
when he'll be back?

05:23.965 --> 05:24.793
Well I mean-

05:24.793 --> 05:26.000
the seminar's today
and tomorrow.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.448
PD for the PD.

05:28.482 --> 05:30.379
Joe's been doing a lot of
professional development lately.

05:30.379 --> 05:31.862
Yeah I mean when
you take a course-

05:31.862 --> 05:32.620
they bump your pay.

05:32.620 --> 05:33.310
I don't know.

05:33.310 --> 05:34.655
You sure
that's all it is?

05:34.655 --> 05:35.896
What else
would it be?

05:35.896 --> 05:38.655
That's a
lot of days away.

05:38.655 --> 05:39.689
You heard that rumour

05:39.689 --> 05:41.000
about the Chief
Superintendent retiring right?

05:42.413 --> 05:43.517
Really?

05:43.517 --> 05:44.275
Yeah I don't know.

05:44.275 --> 05:45.310
Maybe Joe is
going for it.

05:45.310 --> 05:48.103
Guys I've been thinking
about this a lot.

05:48.103 --> 05:49.379
So if Joe leaves
Major Crimes-

05:49.379 --> 05:50.793
that means we would
get a new boss-

05:50.793 --> 05:51.724
who could be fine.

05:51.724 --> 05:52.793
Or awful.

05:52.793 --> 05:53.724
Or not.

05:53.724 --> 05:54.965
You really don't
like change, do you?

05:54.965 --> 05:56.827
It's a
little too early

05:56.827 --> 05:58.103
to worry, anyway.

05:58.103 --> 05:59.931
If Joe's going
anywhere, we'd know.

05:59.931 --> 06:00.793
Wouldn't we?

06:00.793 --> 06:02.758
Yeah I sure hope
you're right.

06:02.758 --> 06:03.448
Hey.

06:03.448 --> 06:04.586
Where are
you off to?

06:04.586 --> 06:05.310
The morgue.

06:05.310 --> 06:06.620
I hope it's
nothing serious.

06:06.620 --> 06:07.413
No no, it's just-

06:08.896 --> 06:09.965
Oh, you're being funny.

06:09.965 --> 06:11.241
That's- okay.

06:11.241 --> 06:13.379
I'm in the middle of a game
of Snakepit with Karma.

06:13.379 --> 06:14.103
You're still playing that?

06:14.103 --> 06:14.931
You won yet?

06:15.655 --> 06:16.689
It's not about
winning or losing.

06:16.689 --> 06:17.724
It's about the adventure.

06:17.724 --> 06:18.551
So no.

06:18.551 --> 06:19.931
Tonight's the night.

06:19.931 --> 06:22.172
So, that's
where I'll be-

06:22.172 --> 06:23.068
if anything comes up-

06:23.068 --> 06:24.586
you need me.

06:24.586 --> 06:26.241
Wish me luck.

06:26.241 --> 06:27.206
Mm-hmm.

06:28.931 --> 06:29.551
Hmm?

06:29.551 --> 06:31.206
Jesse and Karma?

06:31.206 --> 06:32.310
No.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.586
No no, I
doubt that.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.758
They're not
really a match.

06:35.758 --> 06:36.724
I don't know!

06:36.724 --> 06:37.827
People would say the
same thing about us.

06:37.827 --> 06:39.310
Who would say
that about us?

06:39.310 --> 06:40.206
What are you
talking about?

06:40.206 --> 06:41.448
We're a great match.

06:41.448 --> 06:42.793
Brains and brawn.

06:42.793 --> 06:43.517
Which is which?

06:43.517 --> 06:44.689
Sweet and spicy.

06:44.689 --> 06:46.379
Badass and bookworm.

06:46.379 --> 06:47.758
Goofy and mature?

06:47.758 --> 06:48.586
Exactly.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.241
Wait what?

06:51.241 --> 06:51.896
Rex knows.

06:52.931 --> 06:53.586
See?

06:53.586 --> 06:54.275
Huh.

06:54.275 --> 06:55.482
He agrees.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.241
Yeah, remember where your
next meal is coming from pal.

07:00.034 --> 07:00.862
You see?

07:00.862 --> 07:02.620
I know a way to
a dog's heart.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.103
Yeah, bribery.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.275
Exactly.

07:14.931 --> 07:16.448
You know, it's your
fault we're in here.

07:17.206 --> 07:17.896
You hit me first.

07:17.896 --> 07:18.793
Because
you deserved it.

07:18.793 --> 07:21.000
Will you two
shut up?

07:21.896 --> 07:22.931
Ain't your business!

07:22.931 --> 07:24.931
Well leave
me out of it.

07:27.206 --> 07:28.172
You ain't in it!

07:28.275 --> 07:30.000
If I can
hear it, I'm in it.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.620
Why are you
listening anyway?

07:31.620 --> 07:32.758
I don't feel
so good.

07:33.689 --> 07:34.586
Lightweight.

07:37.586 --> 07:38.689
No, really.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.068
Hey, guard!

07:41.068 --> 07:42.413
Guard, we've got
a problem here!

07:55.517 --> 07:56.379
Jesse!

07:56.379 --> 07:57.413
You shouldn't
sneak up like that!

07:57.413 --> 07:58.103
Oh I'm sorry.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.034
I'm sorry, um-

07:59.965 --> 08:01.620
You look like you
have somewhere to be.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.379
Yeah just this

08:02.379 --> 08:03.827
charity thing tonight.

08:04.827 --> 08:07.827
So I thought I'd switch
up my look a little bit!

08:10.896 --> 08:12.206
What do you think?

08:12.206 --> 08:13.724
Yeah you look-

08:13.724 --> 08:14.482
you look-

08:16.241 --> 08:17.758
nice.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.068
Nice?

08:19.068 --> 08:21.379
That's not exactly
what I was going for.

08:21.379 --> 08:22.758
Well no, I mean-

08:22.758 --> 08:24.241
what I meant to-

08:25.862 --> 08:26.724
Well I mean-

08:26.724 --> 08:27.931
that's not-

08:29.068 --> 08:30.241
It's working.

08:32.103 --> 08:33.000
I'll take it.

08:37.275 --> 08:39.586
Do you need
something from me?

08:39.586 --> 08:42.275
Yeah well I mean-

08:42.275 --> 08:44.586
I was hoping we could
finish our game.

08:44.586 --> 08:46.137
You're a glutton
for punishment.

08:46.793 --> 08:47.448
Sure.

08:47.448 --> 08:48.137
Nice.

08:48.137 --> 08:48.931
I've got
half hour.

08:48.931 --> 08:51.172
That should be all
the time I need.

08:51.172 --> 08:52.379
Oh don't count
on it okay?

08:52.379 --> 08:53.413
I'm set up perfectly

08:53.413 --> 08:55.172
for a classic
redemption arc.

08:56.103 --> 08:56.896
It's my turn right?

08:56.896 --> 08:57.551
Yes.

08:57.551 --> 08:58.344
Okay.

08:58.344 --> 09:00.137
Get ready.

09:00.517 --> 09:01.620
That's bad.

09:05.137 --> 09:05.827
Oh.

09:07.241 --> 09:08.172
Listen.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.172
I admire your commitment
to your strategy.

09:10.172 --> 09:11.517
But at some point-

09:11.517 --> 09:13.448
you're going to have to
admit that it's not working.

09:13.448 --> 09:14.137
Never.

09:16.310 --> 09:18.172
Now would you
consider a trade?

09:18.172 --> 09:20.586
I know I might look
like a pushover, Jesse.

09:20.586 --> 09:22.448
But in here-

09:22.448 --> 09:23.655
I am cutthroat.

09:23.655 --> 09:25.448
There will be
no handouts.

09:25.448 --> 09:27.310
There will
be no mercy.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.344
Ohhh!

09:32.724 --> 09:33.620
That's-

09:33.620 --> 09:34.310
That's Luck.

09:34.310 --> 09:35.034
You're lucky.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.379
The gods of Snakepit

09:36.379 --> 09:38.655
are bountiful to
those who deserve it.

09:41.689 --> 09:42.620
Skye.

09:42.620 --> 09:43.620
Skye talk to me.

09:43.620 --> 09:44.758
Let me know
you're okay.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.482
Guards we need
help here now!

09:46.482 --> 09:47.310
She's out cold!

09:47.310 --> 09:48.206
You've got
to come now!

09:48.206 --> 09:49.344
Hurry up!

09:49.758 --> 09:50.827
Skye Skye!

09:50.827 --> 09:51.620
Get in here now!

09:51.620 --> 09:52.586
She's unconscious!

09:52.586 --> 09:53.413
Come on!

09:53.413 --> 09:54.379
Hurry up!

09:55.275 --> 09:56.275
What took
you so long?

09:56.275 --> 09:56.965
Here he comes!

09:57.068 --> 09:57.620
Here he comes!

09:57.620 --> 09:58.310
You're okay.

09:58.310 --> 09:59.310
Is she okay?
Get up!

09:59.310 --> 10:00.172
She can't!

10:00.172 --> 10:01.758
Come on, you've
got to help her man.

10:02.827 --> 10:03.620
Who asked you?

10:03.620 --> 10:04.896
I'm just saying, look.

10:04.896 --> 10:05.551
Hurry up!

10:05.551 --> 10:06.793
Help her man.

10:06.793 --> 10:07.620
That's my lady!

10:07.620 --> 10:08.724
Ma'am.

10:08.724 --> 10:10.000
Ma'am are
you all right?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.551
She better
not die in here.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.620
Ma'am, I said
are you all right?

10:13.620 --> 10:14.827
You need
to get a medic!

10:14.827 --> 10:16.586
If anything happens
to her that's on you!

10:16.586 --> 10:17.275
She needs help!

10:17.275 --> 10:18.172
You're not
listening to me!

10:18.172 --> 10:19.206
Ma'am
are you all right?

10:19.206 --> 10:20.241
Get a medic
in here man!

10:20.241 --> 10:21.172
She needs help!

10:21.275 --> 10:22.103
His gun!
Get his gun!

10:22.103 --> 10:23.103
Oh!

10:24.137 --> 10:25.551
You had no idea!

10:26.241 --> 10:26.965
Okay come on!

10:26.965 --> 10:29.000
We've got the
A-Team here!

10:29.000 --> 10:29.896
Cuffs cuffs!

10:29.896 --> 10:30.551
Get his cuffs!

10:30.551 --> 10:31.793
I'm getting them.

10:31.793 --> 10:34.172
You've got a lot of jam for
such a pretty little thing.

10:34.172 --> 10:35.793
Shut up, Billy.

10:37.827 --> 10:39.103
I will when
you let me out!

10:40.482 --> 10:41.172
There we go.

10:41.172 --> 10:43.965
You are a genius.

10:43.965 --> 10:44.758
Give me that.

10:44.758 --> 10:45.655
Come on.

10:45.758 --> 10:47.068
Ohhh!

10:47.068 --> 10:47.965
Yeah.

10:47.965 --> 10:50.413
Uh, you forgetting
about somebody here?

10:52.000 --> 10:52.655
Sorry sweetie!

10:55.275 --> 10:55.965
Hi!

10:57.620 --> 10:59.068
True love.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.551
Oh, nice work.

11:01.551 --> 11:02.448
Hey hey hey hey!

11:04.551 --> 11:05.965
I didn't kill
him, did I?

11:05.965 --> 11:07.655
No, he'll be out a
good long while though.

11:09.551 --> 11:10.275
Back in the cell.

11:10.275 --> 11:11.103
What?

11:17.034 --> 11:18.655
Left paw, Rex.

11:18.655 --> 11:19.379
No no no.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.517
No, other left.

11:21.689 --> 11:22.310
Other paw.

11:22.310 --> 11:23.241
Yes!

11:23.241 --> 11:24.793
Good boy!

11:25.827 --> 11:26.793
Good boy.

11:26.793 --> 11:27.862
Okay yeah,
thanks for the update.

11:29.206 --> 11:30.517
Well that's the
airport authorities.

11:30.517 --> 11:32.206
Airport's going to be
open in another hour.

11:32.206 --> 11:33.241
They find anything?

11:33.241 --> 11:34.551
Couple of unclaimed bags.

11:34.551 --> 11:35.586
So, normal.

11:35.586 --> 11:37.000
Yep.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.586
Any idea who called
in the threat?

11:38.586 --> 11:39.413
No no.

11:39.413 --> 11:40.344
Probably just a prank.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.034
Okay so-

11:43.034 --> 11:43.965
once the airport's open-

11:43.965 --> 11:45.172
Mumford is
out of here.

11:47.965 --> 11:49.482
Yeah, judging
by the time-

11:49.482 --> 11:51.620
that's probably
tomorrow morning now.

11:55.827 --> 11:56.517
What?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.517
I wonder if that's
a coincidence?

12:02.517 --> 12:03.724
It's Charlie Hudson.

12:07.413 --> 12:08.241
Rawlins.

12:08.241 --> 12:09.137
Coffee.

12:09.137 --> 12:09.862
This is a one-time-

12:10.517 --> 12:11.206
thing.

12:12.689 --> 12:14.206
Hope that's a
double double.

12:15.758 --> 12:16.620
No!

12:18.310 --> 12:19.620
What the hell
did you just do?

12:19.620 --> 12:21.931
No one is getting
out of here.

12:21.931 --> 12:23.793
I guess that
includes you too.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.275
Oh, this is exciting.

12:29.275 --> 12:30.068
Really?

12:30.068 --> 12:31.206
Yeah yeah.

12:31.206 --> 12:32.000
Thank you.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.689
The call to the airport
was made by a burner phone.

12:36.586 --> 12:37.413
No one took credit?

12:38.482 --> 12:39.655
No, no not yet.

12:39.655 --> 12:40.517
I mean it's
not unusual.

12:40.517 --> 12:41.620
But-

12:41.620 --> 12:43.862
burner phones suggest
more planning than prank.

12:45.379 --> 12:46.275
What is it pal?

12:55.344 --> 12:56.896
You've got to
be kidding me.

12:56.896 --> 12:58.241
What's he saying?

12:58.241 --> 12:59.241
Hold on.

13:00.931 --> 13:02.586
You'd better get
me what I need-

13:02.586 --> 13:04.241
or both these cops
are going to die!

13:20.655 --> 13:22.172
Okay how many people
do we have up here?

13:22.172 --> 13:24.379
Uh, at least
two up here.

13:24.379 --> 13:25.482
Jesse and Karma
in the morgue.

13:25.482 --> 13:26.586
Two behind bars.

13:26.586 --> 13:29.413
Yeah but who knows how
many are in the building?

13:29.413 --> 13:31.620
I mean, should
we call in SWAT?

13:34.103 --> 13:35.068
No.

13:35.068 --> 13:35.793
Not yet.

13:35.793 --> 13:37.206
Escalation might
make this worse.

13:37.206 --> 13:38.068
Define worse.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.965
Well nobody's
shooting anybody yet.

13:39.965 --> 13:42.172
That's when worse starts.

13:42.172 --> 13:43.965
Does this thing work?

13:43.965 --> 13:44.931
Push the button.

13:46.758 --> 13:48.448
Hey Billy!

13:48.448 --> 13:50.586
Oh hi!

13:50.586 --> 13:52.586
Is that your sultry
voice I hear Charlie?

13:52.586 --> 13:53.896
What in the hell
are you doing?

13:53.896 --> 13:55.517
What's your plan here?

13:55.517 --> 13:56.379
What's my plan?

13:56.379 --> 13:57.448
What's my plan?

13:57.448 --> 13:59.241
My plan, Hudson, is to
get the heck out of here.

13:59.241 --> 14:00.068
Okay.

14:00.068 --> 14:01.586
Release the hostages
and we'll talk.

14:01.586 --> 14:02.655
Oh okay!

14:02.655 --> 14:03.758
Yeah sure sure sure!

14:03.758 --> 14:05.344
Yeah I'll do that!

14:05.344 --> 14:06.379
What do you
think I am?

14:06.379 --> 14:07.103
An idiot?

14:10.137 --> 14:11.068
What do you want?

14:11.068 --> 14:12.379
Okay, that's better.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.034
That's better.

14:14.034 --> 14:15.241
What I want
is simple.

14:15.241 --> 14:16.862
I want a half
million dollars-

14:16.862 --> 14:17.965
and a fully-
gassed chopper.

14:20.551 --> 14:22.586
Well that's going
to take a little time.

14:26.862 --> 14:28.517
Well, you've
got an hour.

14:34.137 --> 14:35.724
Next steps?

14:49.586 --> 14:50.275
One sec.

14:50.275 --> 14:50.965
Charlie.

14:50.965 --> 14:51.620
Hi.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.137
You need me
up there?

14:53.137 --> 14:54.275
Nice try.

14:54.275 --> 14:56.206
You're just saying that because
you're getting smoked.

14:56.758 --> 14:58.379
Don't put your
hand at me!

14:59.379 --> 15:00.448
Apologies.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.068
Okay.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.620
Okay yeah.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.344
Karma we
have a problem.

15:05.344 --> 15:06.137
Three prisoners

15:06.137 --> 15:07.103
have taken over
the holding cells.

15:07.103 --> 15:08.310
They have two hostages.

15:08.310 --> 15:10.379
The cells in
the basement?

15:10.379 --> 15:12.344
Just down the
hall from us?

15:12.344 --> 15:14.448
It's a pretty
long hallway.

15:15.034 --> 15:16.103
Are they armed?

15:17.034 --> 15:17.689
Yeah.

15:18.758 --> 15:19.551
Hells bells.

15:19.551 --> 15:20.758
Correct.

15:20.758 --> 15:22.517
And what does
Charlie want us to do?

15:22.517 --> 15:25.310
Well he wants us to lock
the doors and stay put.

15:27.827 --> 15:28.655
Stay put?

15:28.655 --> 15:29.724
That's the
best he has?

15:29.724 --> 15:30.655
Well he's the
ranking officer!

15:31.275 --> 15:32.586
We have to do
what he says!

15:32.586 --> 15:33.620
Well technically-

15:33.620 --> 15:35.137
I'm not a part of the
police chain of command.

15:35.137 --> 15:37.103
There's a reason I work
with dead bodies Jesse!

15:37.103 --> 15:37.965
Plus-

15:37.965 --> 15:39.000
there's somewhere
that I need to be!

15:39.000 --> 15:39.689
Karma.

15:40.275 --> 15:41.068
Breathe.

15:43.172 --> 15:45.137
It's going to
be all right.

15:45.931 --> 15:46.827
See?

15:54.517 --> 15:56.000
Let's do this.

15:59.620 --> 16:00.310
Move.

16:00.310 --> 16:01.068
The table.

16:01.068 --> 16:02.000
Barricade the door!

16:02.000 --> 16:02.724
Oh yeah yeah!

16:06.413 --> 16:09.448
Looks like I got
dressed up for nothing.

16:12.724 --> 16:14.068
Well I mean if it's
any consolation-

16:14.068 --> 16:15.137
you are the best-
dressed person

16:15.137 --> 16:17.517
at this whole
hostage-taking thing.

16:22.827 --> 16:23.724
It's okay pal.

16:23.724 --> 16:24.758
Nothing to worry about.

16:24.758 --> 16:25.586
Charlie.

16:25.586 --> 16:26.620
Okay, something
to worry about.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.068
But we've got it
under control.

16:28.068 --> 16:29.000
Heads up!

16:35.275 --> 16:35.965
Charlie!

16:35.965 --> 16:37.103
Charlie, hey hey.

16:37.103 --> 16:39.000
It looks like he's taking out
the rest of the cameras.

16:40.206 --> 16:41.206
Were you able

16:41.206 --> 16:42.379
to get in touch
with Joe yet?

16:42.379 --> 16:43.862
No, not so far.

16:43.862 --> 16:46.068
It must be one of those check
your cell at the door events.

16:46.068 --> 16:48.034
I'll find out where he
is and get in contact.

16:48.034 --> 16:49.310
Okay well there's
been shot's fired.

16:49.310 --> 16:50.206
I need to
call SWAT.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.068
What the hell
are you doing?

16:55.068 --> 16:56.517
Taking out their eyes.

16:56.517 --> 16:57.379
What's that matter?

16:57.379 --> 16:58.586
We're still
trapped in here!

16:58.586 --> 16:59.862
Well-

17:03.137 --> 17:04.000
It's not working.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.793
The card's not
for that door.

17:05.793 --> 17:06.551
Check that cop's-

17:06.655 --> 17:07.344
Check his pockets!

17:07.344 --> 17:08.241
What am
I looking for?

17:08.241 --> 17:08.896
A fob!

17:08.896 --> 17:09.655
What's a fob?

17:09.655 --> 17:10.586
The things that
open the door!

17:10.586 --> 17:11.379
The little plastic things!

17:11.379 --> 17:12.448
The magnet you idiot!

17:12.448 --> 17:13.758
Don't call me that!

17:13.758 --> 17:15.034
Don't be one!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.448
You three are in
a world of trouble.

17:16.448 --> 17:18.344
I'd say you're
in a hell of a lot worse.

17:18.344 --> 17:19.379
Bingo.

17:19.379 --> 17:20.344
Fobby thing.

17:20.344 --> 17:22.103
I just found us our
ticket out of here.

17:22.103 --> 17:23.413
Okay.

17:25.413 --> 17:26.620
Yeah yeah,
we have them

17:26.620 --> 17:28.034
contained in the
holding cells now.

17:28.034 --> 17:29.724
Two hostages, both members.

17:29.724 --> 17:30.758
Okay stay
where you are.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.000
We're on our way.

17:32.620 --> 17:33.586
Where's your CO?

17:33.586 --> 17:34.517
Joe's at a seminar.

17:34.517 --> 17:35.827
I'm ranking officer.

17:35.827 --> 17:36.551
Okay just stay put.

17:36.551 --> 17:37.379
We got this.

17:37.379 --> 17:38.310
What's the status
of the hostages?

17:38.310 --> 17:39.241
I don't know.

17:39.241 --> 17:40.310
The suspects just
took out the cameras.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.310
But we heard gunshots.

17:44.448 --> 17:45.517
Copy that.

17:46.068 --> 17:46.965
We're there in ten.

17:47.655 --> 17:48.344
All right.

17:49.034 --> 17:49.724
Let's go.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.482
So, what do
we do now?

17:57.310 --> 17:58.758
We wait.

17:59.931 --> 18:00.931
Rex!

18:01.241 --> 18:02.793
Well- he's not
interested in that.

18:02.793 --> 18:03.482
He knows-

18:03.482 --> 18:04.344
there's officers
in trouble.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.172
Hey.

18:05.172 --> 18:06.724
Secure the lobby.

18:10.344 --> 18:11.344
I can't-

18:12.517 --> 18:13.241
Come on, come on.

18:18.344 --> 18:19.206
These don't work.

18:19.206 --> 18:20.344
What, what
do you mean?

18:20.344 --> 18:21.137
Open this door.

18:21.137 --> 18:22.413
I can't.

18:22.413 --> 18:23.655
What do you
mean you can't?

18:23.655 --> 18:25.241
During a lockdown-

18:25.241 --> 18:28.172
the door can only be
triggered from the outside.

18:30.137 --> 18:30.793
She's lying.

18:34.275 --> 18:36.413
I can tell a liar
from a mile away.

18:36.413 --> 18:38.068
I guess it takes
one to know one.

18:38.068 --> 18:39.482
What's that
supposed to mean?

18:40.241 --> 18:41.689
You know
what it means.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.448
Okay leave the outside
problems on the outside!

18:44.448 --> 18:45.517
You open this
door right now-

18:45.517 --> 18:46.620
or that rookie's
first day

18:46.620 --> 18:47.689
is going to
be his last.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.655
I told you
I can't.

18:52.724 --> 18:54.413
She told me that
you're a liar.

18:54.413 --> 18:56.827
And- I believe her.

19:04.896 --> 19:05.517
No.

19:05.517 --> 19:06.689
No no
no no no.

19:06.689 --> 19:07.689
Stay away
from the window.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.448
You heard the
gunshots, right Jesse?

19:09.448 --> 19:10.655
Yeah of course
I heard the gunshots.

19:10.655 --> 19:13.068
So you want to end up a
permanent resident in here?

19:13.068 --> 19:14.206
Well no, I- no.

19:14.206 --> 19:15.896
I think we
should get out.

19:15.896 --> 19:17.758
There's nothing in
here that they want.

19:17.758 --> 19:19.931
Except more hostages!

19:21.103 --> 19:23.482
Wouldn't you rather be with
Charlie and Sarah and Rex?

19:26.689 --> 19:27.655
Look, Charlie said-

19:27.655 --> 19:29.724
Charlie isn't
stuck down here!

19:31.068 --> 19:32.689
And I'm not going
to be either.

19:33.931 --> 19:35.068
What are you doing?

19:35.068 --> 19:36.793
I say we make
a run for it.

19:36.793 --> 19:38.034
What if
they see us?

19:38.034 --> 19:39.655
We don't let
them see us.

19:41.034 --> 19:41.689
Yeah.

19:41.689 --> 19:42.655
Okay yeah.

19:44.137 --> 19:45.517
You might want
to lose the heels.

19:52.965 --> 19:53.689
Charlie.

19:53.689 --> 19:54.517
Yeah.

19:59.137 --> 20:00.137
Rex!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.896
Hopefully he's just
doing reconnaissance.

20:05.689 --> 20:07.413
Could Rex actually
fit in there?

20:31.931 --> 20:32.724
Are you ready?

20:34.310 --> 20:35.241
Hold on.

20:35.241 --> 20:36.793
Make sure the
coast is clear.

20:40.965 --> 20:41.689
All clear?

20:41.689 --> 20:43.586
I don't see anyone.

20:44.758 --> 20:45.482
Did you hear that?

20:45.482 --> 20:47.413
Yeah, that
was my stomach.

20:48.758 --> 20:50.448
Um-

20:50.448 --> 20:51.275
I'm sorry.

20:51.275 --> 20:52.689
I made you stay
to play Snakepit.

20:54.068 --> 20:56.034
This isn't
your fault Jesse.

20:57.275 --> 20:58.068
Yeah?

20:58.655 --> 20:59.413
Yeah.

21:03.172 --> 21:04.344
Okay we should
go meet the team.

21:05.034 --> 21:05.827
Yes.

21:05.827 --> 21:06.517
Oh.

21:08.172 --> 21:08.931
Charlie, yeah.

21:08.931 --> 21:09.655
We're heading to you.

21:09.655 --> 21:10.724
Jesse
I told you

21:10.724 --> 21:11.379
to stay put!

21:13.344 --> 21:15.000
Well someone
had other ideas.

21:29.551 --> 21:30.275
You've got
ten seconds-

21:30.275 --> 21:31.379
to open
that door.

21:31.379 --> 21:32.413
What's that
going to get you?

21:32.413 --> 21:33.172
Ten seconds of freedom?

21:33.172 --> 21:34.517
Not with you two
as human shields.

21:34.517 --> 21:35.931
We've got a
chopper on the way.

21:35.931 --> 21:37.275
Ain't that right Billy?

21:37.275 --> 21:38.448
Yeah that's a laugh.

21:39.413 --> 21:40.034
All right.

21:40.034 --> 21:40.862
Ten seconds up.

21:40.862 --> 21:41.551
Stop!

21:41.551 --> 21:42.310
All right, all right.

21:45.965 --> 21:46.793
All right!

21:48.379 --> 21:49.344
Fine.

21:50.758 --> 21:51.793
What are you doing?

21:51.793 --> 21:52.965
It's the override.

21:52.965 --> 21:54.379
I thought you said
it was locked down.

21:54.379 --> 21:55.068
Yeah.

21:55.068 --> 21:56.344
Well Red was
right sweetie.

21:56.344 --> 21:57.034
I'm a liar.

21:57.034 --> 21:58.413
I told you.

22:02.448 --> 22:03.310
Grab her.

22:04.034 --> 22:05.241
Hey.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.000
Billy.

22:07.758 --> 22:08.482
Ughhh!

22:08.482 --> 22:09.413
Rawlins!

22:09.758 --> 22:10.827
Okay.
- What?

22:10.827 --> 22:11.655
Shooting cops now?

22:12.620 --> 22:13.827
We're breaking out
of a police station.

22:13.827 --> 22:15.689
You didn't think that was a
possibility when you signed up?

22:15.689 --> 22:16.586
Hey!

22:16.586 --> 22:18.344
It's just
his shoulder!

22:18.344 --> 22:19.620
Aghhh!

22:22.241 --> 22:25.241
Stay sharp and keep
your head on a swivel!

22:25.241 --> 22:26.413
I want a command
centre right there.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.206
Copy that.

22:28.551 --> 22:29.551
I want all of
these civilians

22:29.551 --> 22:30.655
out of here now!

22:30.655 --> 22:31.379
All right everyone!

22:31.379 --> 22:32.034
Out this way-

22:32.034 --> 22:33.103
in an orderly fashion.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.413
We're evacuating
the building please!

22:35.000 --> 22:35.931
Evacuate the building!

22:35.931 --> 22:36.965
Go go!

22:41.413 --> 22:42.448
Hudson, we are
in the building.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.137
Copy that.

22:43.137 --> 22:44.172
I'm with Dr.
Sarah Truong.

22:44.172 --> 22:45.724
And the rest of our
staff are coming out now.

22:46.379 --> 22:47.275
You too, Hudson.

22:47.275 --> 22:48.827
Negative negative.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.137
My partner
is still here.

22:50.137 --> 22:50.965
And there's two others.

22:50.965 --> 22:52.068
I'm not leaving
till they're safe.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.551
This is my
scene now.

22:54.551 --> 22:56.379
And I want whoever
else's in there to get out-

22:56.379 --> 22:57.724
immediately!

22:57.724 --> 22:59.137
Yeah well I don't
answer to you.

23:01.344 --> 23:03.137
God's sakes!

23:04.758 --> 23:05.724
Holy smokes!

23:06.862 --> 23:09.172
Are you guys
all right?

23:09.689 --> 23:11.620
Yeah, never better.

23:11.620 --> 23:12.758
You look very nice.

23:12.758 --> 23:13.793
Yeah that's
what I said.

23:14.103 --> 23:14.896
Thanks.

23:16.586 --> 23:17.793
Check that door.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.758
And this
one's locked too.

23:19.758 --> 23:21.965
And it has kind of
a weird keypad.

23:21.965 --> 23:24.000
I think we need one
that's the square kind.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.448
Like there's a door
up there with one.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.862
Yeah, I
can see it from here.

23:37.862 --> 23:39.103
That door takes
this kind of fob.

23:40.206 --> 23:41.068
Huh?

23:42.655 --> 23:43.482
Ughh!

23:45.586 --> 23:46.241
Hey hey hey!

23:47.965 --> 23:48.655
Stop!

23:51.275 --> 23:52.448
Did you see if
Mallory got hit?

23:52.448 --> 23:53.137
No.

23:53.137 --> 23:54.034
Me neither.

23:54.965 --> 23:56.000
You want to
go after her?

23:56.482 --> 23:57.448
No no.

23:57.448 --> 23:59.275
Uh- go get
the other one.

23:59.275 --> 24:00.344
The one you shot?

24:00.344 --> 24:02.241
It don't matter who pulled
the trigger sweetheart.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.758
We're all in this
together now.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.448
Where's Rex?

24:08.448 --> 24:09.310
I lost him.

24:13.206 --> 24:14.172
Here you go.

24:14.172 --> 24:14.827
I got him.

24:15.827 --> 24:16.758
All right,
all right, all right.

24:16.758 --> 24:17.965
See if you can
stop the bleeding.

24:17.965 --> 24:19.172
He's our only
ticket out of here.

24:19.172 --> 24:20.551
Maybe you should
have thought of that

24:20.551 --> 24:21.448
before you shot him!

24:22.206 --> 24:22.862
What can I say?

24:22.862 --> 24:23.724
I live in
the moment.

24:23.724 --> 24:24.413
I'm impulsive!

24:27.344 --> 24:28.000
Wrap him up.

24:29.896 --> 24:31.034
Hey cop!

24:31.034 --> 24:32.344
You hear that?

24:32.344 --> 24:33.758
This one's got about
ten minutes to live.

24:33.758 --> 24:35.655
So you might want to put
a rush on the chopper!

24:35.655 --> 24:36.793
Well
things just went

24:36.793 --> 24:38.103
from bad to worse.

24:43.551 --> 24:45.000
They're still
holding one hostage.

24:46.241 --> 24:46.931
Apparently wounded.

24:46.931 --> 24:48.241
Likely gunshot.

24:48.241 --> 24:50.275
What's the status
of the other officer?

24:50.275 --> 24:50.931
I don't know.

24:50.931 --> 24:52.586
I think she escaped.

24:52.586 --> 24:53.275
We're coming in.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.000
No no.

24:55.000 --> 24:55.862
We're negotiating.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.517
The situation is stable.

24:57.517 --> 24:59.172
You said-

24:59.172 --> 25:00.620
they were
holding a hostage.

25:00.620 --> 25:01.689
Doesn't make
it less stable.

25:01.689 --> 25:02.379
Look.

25:02.379 --> 25:03.551
Mumford is a killer.

25:03.551 --> 25:04.586
But he's not
a dumb man.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.655
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

25:08.655 --> 25:10.034
Means if I
stall him long enough-

25:10.034 --> 25:11.758
he'll see the hopelessness
of the situation.

25:16.586 --> 25:17.931
I don't think
he thinks like us.

25:17.931 --> 25:19.586
He's got
nothing to lose.

25:19.586 --> 25:20.931
We can't let him
set the agenda.

25:20.931 --> 25:21.620
Charlie.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.206
I have to
get in there.

25:23.206 --> 25:24.241
That kid's going
to bleed out.

25:24.241 --> 25:25.517
It's not safe.

25:25.517 --> 25:28.068
Jesse, we know Mumford's
history inside out.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.620
What do we have
on the other two?

25:29.620 --> 25:30.551
Okay one is
Skye Gibson.

25:30.551 --> 25:31.896
The other one
is Toby Blu.

25:31.896 --> 25:33.724
They've been in and out
of trouble with the law

25:33.724 --> 25:34.862
for most of
their lives.

25:34.862 --> 25:35.827
But nothing like this.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.931
What's their association
with Mumford?

25:37.931 --> 25:39.724
Three of them were caught
selling stolen lottery tickets

25:39.724 --> 25:40.655
a few years back.

25:40.655 --> 25:41.517
But not much else.

25:43.034 --> 25:47.206
And that was enough to
convince them to do this.

25:50.068 --> 25:50.965
Where the
hell is Blu?

25:51.896 --> 25:52.896
How should I know?

25:52.896 --> 25:54.655
He went off
wandering somewhere.

25:54.655 --> 25:55.689
Probably looking
for a way out.

25:55.689 --> 25:56.379
Go find him!

25:57.344 --> 25:58.103
You think it's a good
idea we split up?

25:58.103 --> 25:59.344
It's a hell of a
lot better idea

25:59.344 --> 26:01.586
than that bozo running
around on his own!

26:02.793 --> 26:03.586
Go look.

26:07.241 --> 26:07.965
Hey hey hey.

26:09.172 --> 26:09.827
Hey.

26:09.827 --> 26:10.586
Listen.

26:10.586 --> 26:11.689
You know another
way out of here?

26:11.689 --> 26:12.620
No.

26:12.620 --> 26:14.379
I don't.

26:14.379 --> 26:16.000
It's my first day.

26:16.586 --> 26:17.482
Right.

26:18.137 --> 26:19.344
Well you get
out of this alive

26:19.344 --> 26:20.586
they might just
give you a medal.

26:20.586 --> 26:21.275
Come on.

26:23.241 --> 26:23.965
Come on.

26:25.620 --> 26:26.551
All right.

26:26.551 --> 26:27.827
This way.

26:35.793 --> 26:36.586
Blu?

26:38.068 --> 26:38.896
Baby?

26:41.517 --> 26:42.689
Baby?

26:48.827 --> 26:50.137
Where are you?

27:05.586 --> 27:06.896
Yeah, here we go.

27:12.275 --> 27:13.482
Oh yes!

27:13.482 --> 27:14.620
What are you doing?

27:15.379 --> 27:16.206
Firearms are
locked up tight.

27:16.206 --> 27:17.724
But this is
wide open!

27:19.000 --> 27:20.413
Billy's going
to kill you.

27:20.413 --> 27:21.827
I ain't scared
of Billy.

27:21.827 --> 27:22.724
Well you
should be scared

27:22.724 --> 27:23.551
of me.

27:23.551 --> 27:25.068
Put it down.

27:25.724 --> 27:27.000
Put that down.

27:28.206 --> 27:28.862
All right.

27:28.862 --> 27:29.965
Let's go.

27:29.965 --> 27:30.758
Are you sure Skye?

27:30.758 --> 27:32.275
Like how about
just a little bit?

27:32.275 --> 27:33.482
Not here.

27:33.482 --> 27:34.551
Not now.

27:34.551 --> 27:35.379
Not ever?

27:36.620 --> 27:37.827
I didn't say
that sweetie.

27:37.827 --> 27:38.482
Okay.

27:38.482 --> 27:39.482
Just not now!

27:39.482 --> 27:40.344
Come on.

27:48.655 --> 27:50.000
Charlie!

27:54.241 --> 27:55.034
Let's go.

27:55.034 --> 27:56.206
It's Mallory!

28:04.827 --> 28:06.068
Mallory, are
you all right?

28:07.137 --> 28:08.448
I am now.

28:08.448 --> 28:09.379
You two.

28:09.379 --> 28:10.655
Can you get Officer
Mallory out of here?

28:10.655 --> 28:11.379
Jesse and Karma: Yeah.

28:11.379 --> 28:12.551
Sarah, come with me?

28:12.551 --> 28:13.241
Okay.

28:14.862 --> 28:15.482
One out.

28:15.482 --> 28:16.206
One to go.

28:18.724 --> 28:19.379
Rex!

28:19.379 --> 28:20.931
Oh there he
goes again.

28:37.413 --> 28:38.689
Where the hell
have you been?

28:38.689 --> 28:40.655
Here you take him!

28:40.655 --> 28:41.551
Just taking a
look around.

28:41.551 --> 28:42.931
There's a lot of
good stuff in here!

28:42.931 --> 28:43.793
I don't care
about that!

28:43.793 --> 28:44.827
I care about
a way out!

28:44.827 --> 28:45.965
That's it!

28:45.965 --> 28:47.000
You've got
to focus Blu!

28:47.000 --> 28:47.689
Focus!

28:47.689 --> 28:48.655
You understand?

28:48.655 --> 28:49.379
Got it man.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.310
Sorry.

28:50.310 --> 28:51.137
Focus.
- Yeah, focus.

28:51.137 --> 28:52.448
Maybe you guys
should stop focusing

28:52.448 --> 28:54.103
and actually finding
us a way out of here!

28:54.206 --> 28:55.448
Hey Mumford!

28:55.448 --> 28:56.896
Let's talk.

28:56.896 --> 28:58.620
About what?

28:58.620 --> 29:00.758
I want you to
let the officer go.

29:00.758 --> 29:01.517
No can do.

29:01.517 --> 29:03.206
He's the only
card I got.

29:03.206 --> 29:04.379
I'll give
you a better one.

29:04.379 --> 29:05.413
You let him go.

29:05.413 --> 29:06.275
You take me.

29:06.931 --> 29:07.793
Charlie?

29:07.793 --> 29:08.965
Why the
hell would I do that?

29:08.965 --> 29:11.000
So the kid doesn't
bleed to death.

29:11.000 --> 29:11.896
How's that?

29:11.896 --> 29:13.482
The kid don't
matter to me.

29:13.482 --> 29:14.517
All right.

29:14.517 --> 29:15.344
How about this?

29:15.344 --> 29:16.586
Wait for the
kid to die.

29:16.586 --> 29:17.758
And then I send
SWAT in there

29:17.758 --> 29:19.620
to shred all
three of you.

29:19.620 --> 29:20.517
Hmmm?

29:20.517 --> 29:21.206
How's that sound?

29:21.206 --> 29:21.862
Because right now-

29:21.862 --> 29:22.620
I'm the only one

29:22.620 --> 29:23.620
preventing that
from happening.

29:23.620 --> 29:25.551
But SWAT
won't shoot you

29:25.551 --> 29:26.965
if you're holding me.

29:26.965 --> 29:28.448
Don't do it Charlie!

29:29.931 --> 29:30.551
All right.

29:30.551 --> 29:31.620
You've got a deal.

29:41.137 --> 29:42.172
All right.

29:42.172 --> 29:42.896
Come on, come on.

29:42.896 --> 29:44.275
We've got to
get out of here.

29:49.034 --> 29:49.793
Are you okay?

29:49.793 --> 29:50.758
Yeah.

29:53.172 --> 29:54.206
What's going
on up there?

29:54.206 --> 29:55.862
Detective Hudson has
got it under control.

29:56.827 --> 29:57.551
Yeah.

29:57.551 --> 29:59.448
Sure looks like
it, doesn't it?

30:02.241 --> 30:03.724
Hey um-

30:03.724 --> 30:04.931
You should go.

30:04.931 --> 30:06.620
Not while they're
still up there.

30:48.620 --> 30:49.689
What's the status?

30:49.689 --> 30:51.000
There are currently
three armed prisoners

30:51.000 --> 30:52.275
on the loose
inside your station.

30:52.275 --> 30:53.241
I see.

30:53.241 --> 30:54.896
And Detective Hudson
has denied us entry.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.103
Can you get him
on the horn?

30:56.103 --> 30:57.000
Yeah of course.

30:58.206 --> 30:59.482
Hudson?

31:01.655 --> 31:03.275
Hi this is
Sarah Troung.

31:03.275 --> 31:05.000
Sarah it's Joe.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.965
I need Charlie.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.448
I can't
do that, Joe.

31:08.448 --> 31:09.275
Why not?

31:09.965 --> 31:11.620
Charlie is in
there with them.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.793
He's been taken hostage?

31:13.793 --> 31:15.620
No he surrendered
himself to them.

31:15.620 --> 31:16.310
He did what?

31:16.310 --> 31:17.448
Yeah.

31:17.448 --> 31:20.344
Both he and Rex are in a
secured area of the building.

31:20.344 --> 31:22.137
Why did he
volunteer himself?

31:23.517 --> 31:25.517
He did it to save
Rawlins's life.

31:28.206 --> 31:29.413
Rawlins is with
paramedics now.

31:29.413 --> 31:30.620
I understand.

31:31.827 --> 31:32.517
All right.

31:32.517 --> 31:33.724
This is it,
we're going in.

31:33.724 --> 31:34.448
Hey hey.

31:34.448 --> 31:36.689
You will do
no such thing.

31:36.689 --> 31:38.068
That's my lead man
and Rex up there.

31:38.068 --> 31:39.620
I'll not have one of your
trigger happy cowboys-

31:39.620 --> 31:40.310
Okay all right.

31:40.310 --> 31:41.103
Watch your mouth.

31:41.103 --> 31:42.172
Who do you think
you're talking to?

31:42.172 --> 31:43.551
I am the
ranking officer.

31:43.551 --> 31:44.275
You will stand down.

31:44.275 --> 31:45.344
I'll go over
your head.

31:45.344 --> 31:47.413
You go over my head, I'll
put my foot in your ass-

31:48.620 --> 31:49.793
since we're talking anatomy.

32:16.758 --> 32:17.586
Come on.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Let's go.

32:32.310 --> 32:33.137
Let's go.

32:33.137 --> 32:34.103
Move it.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.000
All right, Hudson.

32:39.000 --> 32:39.655
Where's my chopper?

32:39.655 --> 32:40.482
Where's my money?

32:40.482 --> 32:41.827
You know that's
not coming, Billy.

32:41.827 --> 32:42.517
What do you mean?

32:42.517 --> 32:43.241
We had an arrangement.

32:43.241 --> 32:44.310
I want my money!

32:44.310 --> 32:45.689
I can't believe you two
are going along with this.

32:45.689 --> 32:47.551
You really want him to
drag you all the way down?

32:47.551 --> 32:48.379
Okay just-

32:48.379 --> 32:49.379
Shut up for
a second okay?

32:49.379 --> 32:50.517
Stop talking.

32:50.517 --> 32:51.482
You're just trying to
distract from the situation.

32:51.482 --> 32:52.724
We had an agreement!

32:52.724 --> 32:53.793
We only let
that kid go

32:53.793 --> 32:54.551
before he died-

32:54.551 --> 32:55.862
so you could get
us out of here!

32:55.862 --> 32:57.137
You play
games with us-

32:57.137 --> 32:58.551
you're not going to
make it through this!

32:58.551 --> 32:59.965
But if you'd rather
be a human shield-

32:59.965 --> 33:02.931
I know just where to shoot you
so you'll bleed out slowly.

33:02.931 --> 33:03.655
Understand?

33:03.655 --> 33:05.448
You
want to do that?

33:05.448 --> 33:07.379
Okay, go ahead.

33:07.379 --> 33:09.241
But think about where
that leaves you.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.068
I'm not your
ticket out of here.

33:12.068 --> 33:14.103
All I did was buy
you some time.

33:14.103 --> 33:16.241
if Mumford wants to put
a bullet in me for that-

33:16.241 --> 33:18.724
I can't stop him.

33:18.724 --> 33:19.862
But when he
shoots me-

33:19.862 --> 33:21.344
you don't see the
light of day again.

33:21.344 --> 33:22.206
He's got
nothing to lose.

33:25.689 --> 33:26.413
You do.

33:26.413 --> 33:28.586
And you know
I'm right.

33:31.137 --> 33:32.137
I warned you.

33:32.793 --> 33:33.689
I know just
the spot.

33:38.482 --> 33:39.241
Hey!

33:39.241 --> 33:39.965
Ughh!

33:40.068 --> 33:41.344
Get off me!

33:42.896 --> 33:43.551
Ughh!

33:45.206 --> 33:46.448
Get him!

33:52.103 --> 33:52.724
Let me guess.

33:52.724 --> 33:53.793
You missed him?

33:53.793 --> 33:54.689
Yeah.

33:54.689 --> 33:57.517
Well you know how
I feel about guns.

33:58.931 --> 33:59.827
Agghhh!

34:02.034 --> 34:03.517
What's going on
in there, Sarah?

34:04.655 --> 34:06.482
Everything's under control.

34:06.482 --> 34:07.172
No.

34:07.172 --> 34:08.689
Do not
lie to me.

34:08.689 --> 34:11.413
The situation
is fluid Joe.

34:11.413 --> 34:12.724
Charlie and
Rex are on it.

34:12.724 --> 34:15.413
Okay then tell them to get
their butts back in the bullpen-

34:15.413 --> 34:16.103
and secure the place.

34:16.103 --> 34:18.310
I'm sending
SWAT in.

34:18.310 --> 34:19.310
Finally.

34:19.310 --> 34:21.482
No I can't tell
him to do that, Joe.

34:21.482 --> 34:23.172
I don't know
where they are.

34:23.275 --> 34:25.000
Wait hold
on one sec!

34:31.137 --> 34:32.482
This is a big
time SNAFU!

34:32.482 --> 34:33.620
Watch it, Blu!

34:33.620 --> 34:35.103
Surrounded by cops
but no hostages!

34:35.103 --> 34:36.758
We ain't getting
out of this man!

34:36.758 --> 34:37.827
You got us in
bad trouble!

34:37.827 --> 34:40.034
Yeah, so
what's the plan?

34:40.034 --> 34:40.793
I'm thinking.

34:40.793 --> 34:42.689
So stop thinking
and start doing!

34:42.689 --> 34:43.655
I'm thinking!
I'm thinking!

34:43.655 --> 34:45.206
We're going to shoot
our way out of here.

34:45.206 --> 34:46.000
No, no way.

34:46.000 --> 34:46.689
Your life's already over.

34:46.689 --> 34:47.379
You're not ending mine.

34:47.379 --> 34:48.068
Skye, let's go.

34:48.068 --> 34:48.758
What are you doing?

34:48.758 --> 34:49.482
What's it look like?

34:49.482 --> 34:50.482
We're surrendering.

34:50.482 --> 34:51.137
What- don't-

34:51.137 --> 34:51.896
You hear me?

34:51.896 --> 34:53.000
I said we're surrendering!

34:55.620 --> 34:57.000
Yeah I heard it.

34:58.103 --> 34:59.862
Let's see how
this plays out.

35:01.310 --> 35:02.758
Don't do that.
Hey!

35:02.758 --> 35:04.000
I'll do whatever
I want!

35:05.034 --> 35:06.379
Hudson, we're surrendering!

35:06.379 --> 35:08.068
You don't
make decisions!

35:08.068 --> 35:09.241
Stop it!

35:11.034 --> 35:12.206
Hudson we're surrendering!

35:12.206 --> 35:13.103
Joe!

35:13.103 --> 35:14.241
Joe you hear that?

35:14.241 --> 35:14.896
Copy that.

35:14.896 --> 35:15.620
Just hold your men.

35:16.275 --> 35:17.931
This just may
be resolved.

35:21.172 --> 35:22.655
Damn it.

35:22.655 --> 35:24.344
Are you crazy?

35:25.310 --> 35:26.517
What have
you done?

35:26.517 --> 35:27.379
I'm not surrendering.

35:28.068 --> 35:29.655
You shot him!

35:29.655 --> 35:30.689
Don't waste your time!

35:30.689 --> 35:32.000
He's a dead man!

35:32.000 --> 35:33.931
You killed him!

35:33.931 --> 35:35.551
He had a
job to do.

35:35.551 --> 35:36.862
And he
just got soft.

35:36.862 --> 35:37.758
Look.

35:39.034 --> 35:41.862
I have
nothing to lose.

35:41.862 --> 35:42.862
So it's your move.

35:44.000 --> 35:44.827
You hear that
out there?

35:44.827 --> 35:47.034
I got nothing
to lose!

35:47.689 --> 35:49.206
I got nothing
to lose!

36:02.827 --> 36:04.172
I've got them
standing down for now.

36:04.172 --> 36:05.379
But I don't know
for how long.

36:05.379 --> 36:06.655
How's Charlie?

36:06.655 --> 36:08.275
He and Rex
are out of sight.

36:08.275 --> 36:10.310
I'm hoping that they're
cooking something up.

36:10.310 --> 36:11.827
Okay so we
are down to what-?

36:11.827 --> 36:14.344
two escapees and
no hostages right?

36:14.344 --> 36:15.448
Not technically.

36:15.448 --> 36:17.172
Mumford is holding his
accomplice as a hostage.

36:17.172 --> 36:18.206
Yeah but she's someone

36:18.206 --> 36:20.896
who knowingly put
herself into that situation.

36:20.896 --> 36:22.448
What is stopping me
from sending in SWAT?

36:23.586 --> 36:25.793
Charlie and Rex
can resolve this.

36:25.793 --> 36:27.379
Yeah but they're
also at risk.

36:27.379 --> 36:28.655
Mumford's in
high panic mode.

36:28.655 --> 36:30.172
He's going to
make a mistake Joe.

36:30.965 --> 36:31.931
Do you have
any sense

36:31.931 --> 36:33.758
of the condition of
the man that he shot?

36:33.758 --> 36:34.931
Toby Blu?

36:34.931 --> 36:36.586
From what
I can see-

36:36.586 --> 36:37.931
it doesn't look good.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.689
Joe, Charlie just arrived.

36:46.689 --> 36:47.413
He's with Toby.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.482
Charlie.

36:48.482 --> 36:49.482
Charlie what's your status?

36:50.655 --> 36:51.413
Oh, hey Joe.

36:51.413 --> 36:52.448
How was your seminar?

36:52.448 --> 36:54.241
No time for kidding
around Charlie.

36:54.241 --> 36:56.206
We're fine down here.

36:56.206 --> 36:58.586
What's the condition of
the man on the ground?

36:59.413 --> 37:00.137
He's dead.

37:01.482 --> 37:03.413
Do you know where
the other two are?

37:03.413 --> 37:05.068
I can't see anything.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.413
Cameras on Hall Three

37:07.413 --> 37:09.068
and morgue level
have been disabled.

37:10.034 --> 37:11.413
So they probably went
down to the basement.

37:11.517 --> 37:12.241
Basement.

37:13.931 --> 37:14.758
Possible.

37:16.689 --> 37:18.379
Hey Sarah.

37:18.379 --> 37:20.655
Did they ever fix that
broken vent in your lab?

37:22.551 --> 37:24.310
Uh, no!

37:24.827 --> 37:27.137
Maybe Rex and I will
drop in through there.

37:29.620 --> 37:30.689
Okay.

37:30.689 --> 37:32.551
Superintendent.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.103
Charlie, I can't stall
SWAT much longer.

37:34.103 --> 37:35.000
Yeah
I know, Joe.

37:35.000 --> 37:35.758
But I know something

37:35.758 --> 37:36.413
about the girl.

37:36.413 --> 37:37.172
Skye Gibson.

37:37.793 --> 37:38.896
She's not a killer.

37:38.896 --> 37:40.000
Yeah.

37:40.862 --> 37:42.000
But Mumford is.

37:43.241 --> 37:44.379
That's why we've
got to save her.

37:44.379 --> 37:45.172
Come on pal.

38:08.275 --> 38:08.931
Come on pal.

38:14.241 --> 38:15.620
Yeah I know you're
not allowed in here.

38:15.620 --> 38:16.620
We're going to
make an exception

38:16.620 --> 38:17.896
this time.

38:19.103 --> 38:19.931
Come on.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.000
Good job partner.

38:32.172 --> 38:33.310
Hey Sarah.

38:33.310 --> 38:34.931
Charlie, you all right?

38:34.931 --> 38:35.689
Yeah yeah.

38:35.689 --> 38:37.310
I'm just looking
for something.

38:41.137 --> 38:42.793
Yeah I'll start
with magnesium.

38:46.448 --> 38:47.862
Look, Billy.

38:47.862 --> 38:49.000
It was a good
try okay?

38:49.000 --> 38:49.689
But it's over.

38:49.689 --> 38:50.793
No it's not.

38:51.827 --> 38:52.896
What are you doing?

38:52.896 --> 38:54.586
Just checking I
got what's needed.

38:54.586 --> 38:55.758
You're shooting
your way out?

38:55.758 --> 38:56.965
No we're
shooting our way out.

38:58.379 --> 38:59.206
Didn't you
hear me man?

38:59.206 --> 39:00.379
I said
this is over!

39:00.379 --> 39:01.551
No it's not!

39:01.551 --> 39:02.896
Look, we're in this together
whether you like this

39:02.896 --> 39:03.586
or not!

39:03.586 --> 39:04.344
Okay look!

39:04.344 --> 39:05.655
The plan is-

39:05.655 --> 39:07.034
we're going to go
out the lobby doors.

39:07.034 --> 39:07.896
We'll grab
whoever we can

39:07.896 --> 39:08.827
from the bullpen,
and then-

39:08.827 --> 39:09.724
That's the plan?

39:09.724 --> 39:11.137
How do you know
anyone's even in there?

39:11.137 --> 39:12.172
Well they've been
there all day.

39:12.172 --> 39:12.896
They ain't leaving now!

39:14.275 --> 39:15.724
I think it's
a good plan!

39:15.724 --> 39:16.448
Ohhh.

39:18.758 --> 39:19.931
It's that damn dog.

39:19.931 --> 39:21.275
You see his partner
back there?

39:21.275 --> 39:21.965
Billy!

39:30.758 --> 39:31.517
Rex go!

39:34.517 --> 39:35.172
Ughh!

39:37.620 --> 39:38.551
I didn't do it!

39:39.000 --> 39:39.655
They made me!

39:39.655 --> 39:40.689
Get
him off of me!

39:40.689 --> 39:41.413
Yeah I'm sure.

39:42.103 --> 39:43.724
Okay okay!

39:43.724 --> 39:45.137
That's enough pal!

39:45.793 --> 39:46.482
Congratulations Billy.

39:47.448 --> 39:48.655
Now you get to
die in prison.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.413
All units
can stand down.

39:52.413 --> 39:54.103
The situation is contained.

How'd it go, Joe?

42:22.103 --> 42:23.551
Well, I don't
think SWAT

42:23.551 --> 42:25.275
will be sending me a card
for Kwanzaa this year.

42:26.068 --> 42:26.965
You were
expecting that?

42:26.965 --> 42:27.620
No.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.310
No, not really.

42:29.310 --> 42:30.310
But a flash bang!

42:30.310 --> 42:31.034
Well done!

42:31.034 --> 42:32.034
I had
to do something.

42:32.034 --> 42:33.793
I told SWAT I'd get them
out without a shooting.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.103
Mallory and Rawlins?

42:36.103 --> 42:37.379
They'll be good.

42:37.379 --> 42:38.586
I don't think they'll
be seeing duty

42:38.586 --> 42:39.758
for a couple of
weeks though.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.586
Then they're going to
have a lot of paperwork.

42:41.586 --> 42:43.482
Rough first day
for the kid.

42:43.482 --> 42:44.758
Well, it's not
all that bad.

42:44.758 --> 42:45.689
Come again?

42:45.689 --> 42:48.482
Well they got to
see Rex in action!

42:56.379 --> 42:57.172
Nice work Jesse!

42:57.172 --> 42:58.275
You as well!

43:00.862 --> 43:01.517
Good night.
