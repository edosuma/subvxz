You're already getting behind
on the rent, and now
the bank's chasing you.

00:32.146 --> 00:34.523
I don't know what you
want me to say.

00:34.607 --> 00:37.318
Well, how about,
"This is your dream, Isobel,
and it'll take as long

00:37.401 --> 00:40.237
as it takes, to get the farm
going again, so don't worry
about it"?

00:40.321 --> 00:42.198
But what message will that
send to my other tenants?

00:42.281 --> 00:43.949
That you're a great guy.

00:45.660 --> 00:47.495
You're putting me in a really
awkward position, Isobel.

00:47.578 --> 00:50.414
Oh, well, God forbid
that you should be made to
feel awkward, Paul!

00:55.920 --> 00:59.757
Okay, all right, I'll give you
another month rent-free,
but, but that's it!

00:59.840 --> 01:02.093
I don't need your charity.

01:02.176 --> 01:03.844

to sort things out
for you here.

01:03.928 --> 01:05.179
Look, I think you'd better go.

All of him has seen
better days.

01:58.357 --> 02:00.067
Maybe he's hungry.

02:02.820 --> 02:06.365
Are you hungry?
I've got some bread and jam.

02:06.449 --> 02:08.576
Yeah, or there's egg, bacon,
sausage and fried tomato.

02:08.993 --> 02:10.244
Huh?

02:10.328 --> 02:11.495
I was joking.

02:18.127 --> 02:20.296
You could probably even
risk a kiss goodbye,

02:20.379 --> 02:24.300
without totally destroying
your reputation as
the local grump.

02:24.383 --> 02:27.803
-Who says I'm a grump?
-Oh, didn't you know?

brought along,

-It's a good job one of us is.

- Glenbogle?
- Yeah, and you'll shortly be
leaving Glenbogle estate.

03:20.147 --> 03:21.148
So let's go.

03:22.733 --> 03:23.734
What's your name?

03:24.735 --> 03:25.861
Um,

03:29.281 --> 03:31.409
I can't remember. It's, uh,

03:34.662 --> 03:35.830
I can't remember anything.

03:57.059 --> 03:58.936
Can I have a word?

03:59.020 --> 04:00.938
What have I done now?

04:01.022 --> 04:04.859
No, no, son, I just,
I just need your advice.

04:06.986 --> 04:08.404
On what?

04:08.487 --> 04:12.074
On what, in your opinion,

04:14.952 --> 04:17.245
constitutes a romantic dinner.

04:25.963 --> 04:28.674
Yes, he's suffering
from hypothermia,

04:28.758 --> 04:31.469
and is weak through lack
of food.

04:31.552 --> 04:34.889
That could explain
his disorientation
and loss of memory.

04:35.723 --> 04:36.932
What do you recommend?

04:37.016 --> 04:38.309
Well, bed rest
and regular meals.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.438
-How much bed rest?
-Well, it depends.

04:42.521 --> 04:44.065
A day or two, perhaps.

04:44.148 --> 04:46.901
He can't stay here
for two days.

04:46.984 --> 04:50.487
There's plenty of room
at Glenbogle.
Why can't he stay there?

04:50.571 --> 04:52.740
Cause we've got no idea
who he is.

04:52.823 --> 04:55.451
Well if we did, he wouldn't
need to stay there, would he?

04:55.534 --> 04:58.079
He is not staying
at Glenbogle.

04:58.162 --> 05:00.581
When we get to the house,
I'll call PC Callum
and find out

05:00.665 --> 05:02.792
who he is and where he's from.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.960
So you are concerned
about him.

05:05.044 --> 05:08.798
No. If I find out who he is,
he becomes someone
else's problem.

Ah, you're looking
really well.

was just what I needed.

Thalasso-therapy,
seaweed wraps,
this yoga, that yoga!

05:30.444 --> 05:32.738
It's amazing what
a regular detox will do.

05:32.822 --> 05:34.156
I'll bear it in mind.

05:35.282 --> 05:38.035
And also it gave me
a chance to

05:38.119 --> 05:40.287
prioritise what's
important to me.

05:40.955 --> 05:42.498

remember?

Yeah, or you could try

as "him", you'd want to give
him a name.

than he has to.

you'd let him stay
till he was better.

of us that voted
for burning them

for dry cleaning.

-Vegetable soup and croutons,

12:54.263 --> 12:56.974

boiled down! It's a disaster!

-Sorry.

27:48.574 --> 27:50.701
I can't believe you're still
dragging your heels
with Kelly.

27:52.203 --> 27:54.121
"But, but", what?

27:54.205 --> 27:55.790
I know it's a big commitment.

27:55.873 --> 27:58.250
That's why you want to make
it with the best
possible people.

27:58.334 --> 28:01.170
PAUL: Most of the farms
are doing fine,
a couple are struggling,

28:01.253 --> 28:02.588
and one is
in a lot of trouble.

28:03.214 --> 28:05.257
LIAM: Isobel's?

28:05.341 --> 28:07.635
I don't know how much longer
she'll be here.

28:07.718 --> 28:09.512
She's leaving?

28:09.595 --> 28:12.348
She isn't making
the farm work.

28:12.431 --> 28:15.184
You mean, you're thinking
of evicting her?

28:15.267 --> 28:16.977
I may not have a choice.

28:17.061 --> 28:18.854
You always have
a choice, Paul.

28:18.938 --> 28:22.024
She's the kind of person
you should be working hard
to keep here.

28:22.108 --> 28:24.402
Not easy when she refuses
any help I offer.

28:25.778 --> 28:27.947
Well, you just have
to keep trying.

28:28.030 --> 28:30.324
And what makes you qualified
to give advice?

28:30.408 --> 28:32.410
What qualifications do I need?

28:32.493 --> 28:35.079
Well, usually the personal
experience, but since you
can't remember any of yours!

28:35.162 --> 28:37.373
Ah, you're testing me again.

28:37.456 --> 28:38.958
I'm just trying to help.

28:39.041 --> 28:40.835
Trying to get me out
of your hair.

28:42.378 --> 28:44.505
Before I came to Glenbogle,

28:45.506 --> 28:47.633
I'd lost most of my family,

28:49.343 --> 28:50.720
my history.

28:51.846 --> 28:54.265
I found them when I came here.

28:54.348 --> 28:56.475
If I can, I'd like to help
you find yours.

28:58.519 --> 29:01.605
And get you out of my hair,
of course.

29:01.689 --> 29:04.775
Ah, I wish I'd never mentioned
the pictures to Donald.

29:06.736 --> 29:10.114
I feel responsible for
his predicament.

29:10.197 --> 29:14.285
Whatever Donald's
predicament, it is invariably
down to Donald, no-one else.

29:16.245 --> 29:17.830
(ISOBEL LAUGHING)

29:21.000 --> 29:23.919
Well, look, next time I'm back
in Edinburgh, I'll let you
buy me dinner, okay?

29:26.464 --> 29:27.465
Okay, bye.

29:30.092 --> 29:31.552
He'll sign this afternoon.

29:34.805 --> 29:36.515
Ah!

29:36.599 --> 29:41.020
Let's take some tongue
sandwiches and a few slices
of lemon meringue pie.

29:41.103 --> 29:46.442
And, um, some of Molly's
delicious three-bean salad
with the fat-free dressing.

29:46.525 --> 29:49.153
I thought you said
you weren't eating more
of that stuff.

29:49.236 --> 29:51.072
No, you must have misheard me.

29:51.155 --> 29:54.492
No, you said it was fine
for grazing herbivores,
but you're not a cow or... Ow!

29:55.743 --> 29:57.370
Everything all right Molly?

29:57.453 --> 29:59.955
I seem to be putting my foot
in it with everyone lately.

30:00.998 --> 30:03.000
First Donald, now Golly.

30:03.084 --> 30:04.752
Never let the sun go down
on bad feeling.

30:07.463 --> 30:09.715
I'm afraid, there have been
too many sunsets on
the bad feelings

30:09.799 --> 30:11.676
between Donald and myself.

30:11.759 --> 30:13.386
And as for Golly,

30:15.346 --> 30:17.598
I think I've interfered
enough.

30:17.682 --> 30:20.768
You got a real buzz out
of making that call,
didn't you?

30:20.851 --> 30:22.603
Yeah, it felt pretty good.

30:24.897 --> 30:27.733
I didn't come here
for a break, Isobel.

30:27.817 --> 30:29.318
I came here to see
how you were doing

30:29.402 --> 30:31.487
and, if it felt right,
to offer you a job.

30:32.655 --> 30:34.782
I'm talking fifty-fifty,
a partnership.

30:34.865 --> 30:38.869
That means a considerable
pay rise, and a real step up
the career ladder.

30:40.830 --> 30:42.498
I don't know what to say.

30:42.581 --> 30:44.792
Well, don't say anything
for now, just think about it.

30:44.875 --> 30:47.420
You're the best
and I want you back.

30:47.503 --> 30:50.047
I want you back
and standing next to me.

31:05.813 --> 31:07.356
You've fished a river before.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.444
How's our friend doing?

31:12.570 --> 31:14.071
Still sulking.

31:14.905 --> 31:17.825
I am not sulking.

31:17.908 --> 31:22.413
I am coming to terms
with the fact that my past has
been cruelly wrested from me.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.297
-Did we pack the sandwiches?
-I had to limit the meats.

31:31.380 --> 31:34.258
I'm out tonight, so it's
a cold platter and one
of Molly's salads.

31:34.342 --> 31:36.093
Mmm.

31:36.177 --> 31:38.888
Do I sense romancing
in the air?

31:38.971 --> 31:40.181
(DONALD LAUGHING)

31:41.474 --> 31:43.517
He believes he's on a promise.

31:43.601 --> 31:46.437
I believe he's on
a hiding to nothing.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.731
And what do you know
about her?

31:48.814 --> 31:52.151
Plunging deep into the well
of my experience with women,

31:52.234 --> 31:55.029
Isobel's friend is a coquette,

31:55.112 --> 32:00.034
a siren luring you onto
the rocks of despair.

32:00.117 --> 32:03.120
Well, if something bright
and unexpected comes along,
you should always follow it.

32:04.830 --> 32:06.707
If only to see where
it takes you.

32:08.542 --> 32:09.794
You're no lost hiker.

32:11.504 --> 32:12.505
Who are you?

32:13.589 --> 32:15.299
I don't know. Oh!

32:17.093 --> 32:19.637
-Ewan!
-Hold the line.
Hold it! Hold it!

32:34.860 --> 32:36.404
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

32:50.876 --> 32:52.545
Ah, right, it's yourself.

32:52.628 --> 32:54.296
You were expecting
someone else?

32:55.798 --> 32:58.300
Well, I thought it might
have been Meg.

32:58.384 --> 33:00.845
-Is she not here?
-No, no,

33:00.928 --> 33:03.097
she said something about
people gossiping
about her in the village.

33:04.181 --> 33:07.476
It was a misunderstanding.

33:07.560 --> 33:10.730
I was in the market, talking
to Geraldine, and Meg arrived.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.859
Anyway, she's decided not
to come round here so much.

33:15.943 --> 33:17.403
I'm so sorry.

33:19.363 --> 33:21.657
I admit, I was worried
about you,

33:21.741 --> 33:24.618
and so I wanted to find out
more about Meg.

33:25.619 --> 33:27.955
I would appreciate it, Molly,

33:28.039 --> 33:29.707
if you'd stop worrying
about me.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.418
I can't do that.

33:33.169 --> 33:34.211
Sorry?

33:37.006 --> 33:39.383
I'll always look out
for you, Golly.
Always.

33:41.177 --> 33:43.012
And if you can't
accept that, then.

34:00.529 --> 34:02.615
Have you thought about
my offer?

34:02.698 --> 34:06.661
The way things have been
going, I'd be really stupid
not to come back with you.

34:06.744 --> 34:10.081
-Is that a yes?
-It's a very strong maybe.

34:10.164 --> 34:11.248
Mmm-hmm.

34:11.331 --> 34:13.751
-Brodie?
-This way.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.760
Isobel?

34:22.842 --> 34:24.929
Kelly invited me.
You don't mind, do you?

34:25.012 --> 34:28.641
Of course he doesn't, anything
you and I want to do,
we can do in front of you.

34:28.724 --> 34:29.809
Can't we, Ewan?

34:29.891 --> 34:31.768
Aye.

34:31.851 --> 34:35.898
I hope they've got plenty
of these because tonight
we are celebrating.

34:35.981 --> 34:38.109
Celebrating what?

34:38.192 --> 34:41.696
Isobel is packing
up the farm and coming back
to work with me in Edinburgh.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.739
-I didn't say that.
-As good as.

34:49.161 --> 34:50.663
To the future.

35:19.025 --> 35:23.070
I thought Liam's suit was just
a muddy brown jacket
and trousers,

35:23.154 --> 35:25.072
-but this is really well made.
-Hmm.

35:25.156 --> 35:28.659
Even a man of my impeccable
taste wouldn't be ashamed
to be seen in this,

35:28.743 --> 35:30.828
could even be an estate tweed.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.996
-A what?
-Oh, my dear boy,

35:33.080 --> 35:36.500
do you know nothing
relating to your illustrious
new position?

35:36.583 --> 35:40.463
Every estate has its own
distinctive tweed.

35:40.546 --> 35:43.423
If you trace this pattern,
you may find where it
came from.

35:53.142 --> 35:56.270
Take no notice.
She flirts with everyone.

35:56.354 --> 35:57.355
Including me.

35:58.773 --> 36:01.275
Look, are you really
leaving the farm?

36:01.359 --> 36:03.819
Well, things haven't been
going too well lately.

36:03.903 --> 36:06.238
-Paul's not helping, so.
-(KELLY GIGGLES)

36:08.324 --> 36:10.951
You have to accept
when something's
not going to work out.

36:11.034 --> 36:12.035
Right?

36:36.644 --> 36:40.022
-(DOOR OPENS)
-Ah, Donald.

36:42.817 --> 36:44.151
You look troubled.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.946
Just reflecting
on a life spent running away.

36:49.156 --> 36:52.493
I think you'll agree,
there's no heavier weight

36:53.494 --> 36:54.912
than the burden of regret.

36:56.664 --> 37:00.418
We are both of us
shackled to our past, Liam,

37:00.501 --> 37:02.586
whether we like it or not.

37:04.380 --> 37:08.134
And what is it
you've been running from?

37:08.217 --> 37:12.513
I once hurt
the only two people
I have ever loved.

37:17.018 --> 37:19.937
We can continue
this discussion later.
If you'll excuse me.

37:20.604 --> 37:21.605
Donald, I...

37:24.734 --> 37:26.569
He still can't forgive me.

37:26.652 --> 37:30.281
No, he's proud and stubborn.

37:30.364 --> 37:32.533
Seems to be a family trait.

37:32.616 --> 37:34.952
Golly called
while you were out.
He wants to see you.

37:35.036 --> 37:37.330
-Now?
-He'd like you to meet him
at his cottage.

37:38.664 --> 37:41.125
I seem to be making a hash
of everything today.

37:41.208 --> 37:43.252
The sun has yet to set, Molly.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.464
The sun has yet to set.

37:55.848 --> 37:57.224
Sit.

37:57.308 --> 37:59.769
-Golly, I...
-No, please, Molly.

37:59.852 --> 38:01.020
Just sit.

38:10.446 --> 38:14.784
I'm going to do something now
which I never, ever do.

38:14.867 --> 38:17.620
I'm going to talk,
and you three are going
to listen.

38:19.955 --> 38:23.584
In this room are some
of the people who are most
important to me,

38:24.877 --> 38:26.962
and I want to put an end

38:27.046 --> 38:29.632
to all the fighting
and bickering and stuff,
once and for all.

38:32.051 --> 38:33.052
Molly?

38:34.887 --> 38:36.305
Molly, you are my dear friend,
and nothing,

38:39.517 --> 38:41.560
nothing is ever going
to change that.

38:42.937 --> 38:44.063
Do you understand?

38:47.942 --> 38:50.111
Meg,

38:50.194 --> 38:54.865
you are the person here that
I have known the least amount
of time,

38:54.949 --> 38:57.576
but I would like
to get to know you better.

39:00.955 --> 39:02.581
Which brings me to Jess.

39:05.334 --> 39:10.214
Subject to talking to Paul,
I plan to take a week
or two off,

39:10.297 --> 39:13.384
so that Meg and I can go
on holiday to the islands,

39:16.012 --> 39:19.265
which means
I'll be leaving you in charge.

39:23.561 --> 39:25.855
You're trusting me
to run the estate?

39:25.938 --> 39:27.940
Are you my daughter,
or are you not?

40:06.687 --> 40:09.690
This is an estate tweed
from the house of Dundonach,

40:09.774 --> 40:12.485
and the bonnet belongs
to the Royal Company
of Archers,

40:13.861 --> 40:15.696
the Queen's bodyguard
in Scotland.

40:18.866 --> 40:20.993
To be an Archer

40:21.077 --> 40:23.412
is an honour bestowed only
on the ancient families
of Scotland.

40:41.514 --> 40:43.557
I think it's time you talked
to me, don't you?

40:47.603 --> 40:48.979
My name is Phillip.

40:51.232 --> 40:54.485
I had no intention
of deceiving anyone.

40:54.568 --> 40:58.155
I had forgotten
momentarily who I was,

40:59.949 --> 41:04.662
but once you brought me here
and I got my strength back,

41:04.745 --> 41:07.665
memories of my own house
started to flood back,

41:07.748 --> 41:09.375
mostly bad ones.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.005
I did live on an estate,

41:14.839 --> 41:16.382
in Wester Ross.

41:16.465 --> 41:17.758
The Dundonach Estate?

41:19.969 --> 41:23.889
Through a combination
of bad management
and neglect,

41:26.225 --> 41:28.102
it was lost,

41:28.185 --> 41:29.979
and the family dispersed.

41:31.272 --> 41:33.691
And where are the family now?

41:33.774 --> 41:36.819
Last I heard, my brothers were
running a farm in Coigach.

41:38.279 --> 41:40.114
You lost everything?

41:40.197 --> 41:43.534
That's why I know the danger
you're facing if you
allow Isobel to go.

41:43.617 --> 41:46.912
She's tied
into the land financially
and she's tied in emotionally.

41:46.996 --> 41:48.622
If anyone can make it work,

41:49.373 --> 41:50.499
it's her.

41:53.377 --> 41:54.795
Because people

41:55.963 --> 41:57.757
are even more important
than places.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.678
Then, maybe the people you
should be relying on

42:02.762 --> 42:05.639
aren't strangers like Isobel
and me, but your own family.

42:08.684 --> 42:11.187
If you lost all this tomorrow,

42:11.270 --> 42:13.898
through your own mismanagement
and pig-headedness,

42:15.524 --> 42:18.235
would you be able to face
the people you'd disinherited?

42:20.196 --> 42:21.197
I don't know.

42:23.282 --> 42:26.786
Maybe if I'd gone back
within the first six months,
the first year,

42:26.869 --> 42:28.663
-but now...
-Is wandering the countryside

42:28.746 --> 42:30.039
a viable alternative
lifestyle?

42:34.585 --> 42:35.711
It's all I have.

42:37.838 --> 42:40.466
That's what I thought about
my life before I came here.

42:41.926 --> 42:43.469
It worked out for me.

42:45.721 --> 42:48.182
Look, I'm not saying
it's going to be easy,
going back,

42:49.350 --> 42:51.018
but you're not
a bad man, Phillip.

42:52.770 --> 42:56.148
You just made some
bad mistakes.

42:56.232 --> 42:57.900
If you were my brother,
I'd want you back.

43:04.657 --> 43:08.077
While we're handing out advice
to each other,

43:08.160 --> 43:12.164
someone like Isobel would be
quite a catch round here,
am I right?

43:12.248 --> 43:16.002
Oh, no, no! I'll gladly shake
the hand of the man that
finally tames her,

43:16.085 --> 43:18.921
but for me, that is far
too much like hard work.

43:19.005 --> 43:20.881
Nothing worth
getting ever comes easily,
you should know that.

43:22.591 --> 43:25.136
Phillip, we would kill
each other within a week.

43:26.012 --> 43:27.471
Ah, but what a week!

43:32.601 --> 43:33.811
Donald!

43:46.657 --> 43:47.658
"Go inside."

44:18.981 --> 44:21.734
MOLLY:
Hector ordered that all
the pictures be destroyed,

44:21.817 --> 44:23.652
but I couldn't do it.

44:23.736 --> 44:27.281
I hid them until a time came
when they could
come out again.

44:27.365 --> 44:31.285
I hope you can forgive me.
Welcome home. Molly.

46:01.208 --> 46:03.210
I couldn't sleep.

46:03.294 --> 46:05.671
What's your excuse
for being up this early?

46:05.755 --> 46:07.465
Got a lot on my mind.

46:07.548 --> 46:09.842
I didn't think anything
kept you awake at night.

46:09.925 --> 46:12.928
You'd be surprised.

46:13.012 --> 46:15.890
I was coming up here
this morning to see what
we could do about the farm,

46:15.973 --> 46:19.352
but I've heard you might
be leaving.

46:20.895 --> 46:22.646
Kelly's offered me a job
back in Edinburgh.

46:24.440 --> 46:25.566
Are you going to take it?

46:27.026 --> 46:29.236
What choice do I have?

46:29.320 --> 46:31.030
You always have
a choice, Isobel.

46:35.660 --> 46:36.994
It's not a very good job,
is it?

46:37.870 --> 46:39.997
Why do you say that?

46:40.081 --> 46:42.541
If it was, you wouldn't be
wandering the hills, wondering
what you're going to do.

46:42.625 --> 46:44.710
It's a fantastic job,
actually.

46:44.794 --> 46:46.003
Then, why haven't you
taken it?

46:46.837 --> 46:48.297
What is it with you?

46:48.381 --> 46:49.882
Why does everything
have to be black and white?

46:54.011 --> 46:56.055
Why did you come back
to this farm, Isobel?

46:58.057 --> 46:59.183
Because I love it.

47:00.559 --> 47:03.145
Because it's part of me.

47:03.229 --> 47:06.857
Because I spent some of
the happiest times
of my life here.

47:06.941 --> 47:09.402
My dream was to make it
work again.

47:11.278 --> 47:12.822
Does that answer
your question?

47:14.573 --> 47:16.158
Does it answer yours?

47:26.585 --> 47:27.795
Have you decided?

47:30.381 --> 47:31.716
It's not happening here.

47:32.717 --> 47:34.385
No, it's not.

47:34.468 --> 47:36.554
You gave it your best shot.

47:36.637 --> 47:39.682
Chalk it up to experience,
pack your bags. We can be back
in Edinburgh in a few hours.

47:42.184 --> 47:44.103
This place is a dump.

47:45.896 --> 47:47.606
I can't come back
with you, Kelly.

47:48.399 --> 47:49.400
Why not?

47:51.068 --> 47:52.903
For all its many faults,
this is my dump.

47:54.905 --> 47:56.699
I made up my mind.
I'm staying.

48:17.386 --> 48:18.596
Come to see me off?

48:18.679 --> 48:20.931
I came to see if Isobel
was leaving with you.

48:21.515 --> 48:23.017
She's staying.

48:24.185 --> 48:26.687
I'm sorry about last night.

48:26.771 --> 48:29.732
It wasn't you. It was me.

48:29.815 --> 48:32.735
I thought, well,
you know what I thought.

48:41.285 --> 48:44.622
Very, very cute.

49:02.348 --> 49:03.974
What are you smiling about?

49:04.809 --> 49:06.394
Nothing.

49:06.477 --> 49:08.020
Nothing at all.

49:12.525 --> 49:13.651
Liam?

49:27.123 --> 49:28.249
He's gone, hasn't he?

49:33.504 --> 49:35.673
"Phillip Lyle Forester,

49:37.466 --> 49:41.053
"15th Laird
of Dundonach House,
Wester Ross.

49:41.137 --> 49:45.599
"Oversaw the disintegration
of the House of Dundonach
in 1998.

49:47.476 --> 49:50.396
"Disappeared, believed dead."

49:52.440 --> 49:54.567
Well,

49:54.650 --> 49:57.611
we can certainly update this.
He's alive and well
and roaming the country.

49:58.404 --> 50:00.614
You think so?

50:00.698 --> 50:03.451
Unless we've just fed and
watered a dead man for
the past two days.

50:03.534 --> 50:08.122
My dear, dear boy,
why does everything have to be
black and white with you?

50:12.126 --> 50:13.878
Hiya.

50:13.961 --> 50:15.546
So, your friend left, then?

50:17.173 --> 50:19.925
Gone back to hot and cold
running water and cable TV.

50:20.843 --> 50:22.136
Regrets?

50:22.219 --> 50:23.888
Plenty.

50:23.971 --> 50:26.265
But as long as things go well,
I should be okay.

50:27.641 --> 50:29.101
Ta-da!

50:30.269 --> 50:31.729
Now, if you were going
to splash out,

50:31.812 --> 50:34.607
I'd have preferred something
more practical, like,

50:34.690 --> 50:36.650
a decent gardening fork
or a new dibber.

50:38.027 --> 50:39.695
Today is not a day
for dibbers, Isobel,

50:39.779 --> 50:41.822
today is a day
for celebration.

50:42.448 --> 50:43.824
Now, come on.

51:22.905 --> 51:26.409
PAUL: Donald's convinced
he was some kind
of supernatural oracle,

51:26.492 --> 51:28.661
coming to straighten
all our lives out.

51:28.744 --> 51:30.371
ISOBEL: Well, he did help
Molly and Donald.

51:30.454 --> 51:32.665
Believe me, he was no oracle.

51:33.582 --> 51:35.292
How can you be so sure?

51:35.376 --> 51:38.170
Well, for one thing,
he said you and I
should be together.

51:41.298 --> 51:42.633
Exactly.

51:50.099 --> 51:52.435
We'll draw up a proper
business plan tomorrow.

51:52.518 --> 51:55.021
See what we can do
to take the farm forward.

51:55.104 --> 51:56.522
I'll manage.

51:58.232 --> 52:00.651
-Why do you always do that?
-Do what?

52:00.735 --> 52:02.862
Why can't you accept
anyone's help?

52:02.945 --> 52:05.364
Maybe it's just your help
I find hard to accept.

52:05.448 --> 52:07.575
I can't win, can I?

52:07.658 --> 52:10.202
Is that what you've always
got to do, Paul, win?

52:10.286 --> 52:12.204
I'm trying to help.

52:12.288 --> 52:14.665
Then, take the pressure off me
for a while.

52:14.749 --> 52:15.875
I can't do that.

52:26.677 --> 52:28.554
-I thought you came
to celebrate.
-Yeah, I did.

52:28.637 --> 52:31.265
-Well, then, have another.
-No, thanks.

52:31.349 --> 52:34.018
You don't know what
it is to let your hair down,
do you?

52:34.101 --> 52:35.770
Don't I?

52:35.853 --> 52:38.898
Well, when was the last time
that you really went
for something?

52:38.981 --> 52:41.650
Did something that you wanted
and not something
that you had to?

52:41.734 --> 52:43.569
-I do it all the time.
-Yeah? When?

52:44.403 --> 52:45.988
I don't know.

52:46.072 --> 52:49.659
You don't know because
you've never
let yourself do it.

52:49.742 --> 52:52.620
You don't know what it is
to just go for something,
not stop and think about...

53:06.884 --> 53:09.387
-I'd better go.
-Yeah.
