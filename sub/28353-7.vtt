I think the bigger issue is why are
we deciding the baby's gender?

The baby should be deciding for itself.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.219

it seems that everybody
who's touched this money

has had a bad twist of fate.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.588

that stole the money.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.506
Benito and Frankie
were murdered in jail.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.093
Then, Lil' Ricky prematurely died
in a seemingly mysterious way.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.013
And then, the night I found the
money, Olivia and Ruby are shot.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.182
Um, that didn't happen to you.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.101
Don't trivialize my sympathy pain.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.437
Then Abuelita's hands got messed
up and she couldn't work.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.898
- You're drinking this Fool-Aid?
- I'm just following the timeline.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.567
So, we take Abuelita to the
curandera to heal her hand.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.420
And the crazy lady tells us

06:01.440 --> 06:03.696
that something in this
house does not belong.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.907
- Cesar.
- Listen, girl.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.000
Stay with me. This is
before Cesar got here,

06:09.010 --> 06:10.286
when Abuelita had the dough.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.955
Then Ruby breaks the truce,

06:13.030 --> 06:14.760
'cause the money was still in the house.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.959
And then we take the money to Brentwood.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.754
And it's not in Monse's possession
for more than eight hours

06:19.837 --> 06:22.799

and it's making you crazy, too.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.555
And as for the truce ending
and our friends getting shot

06:29.639 --> 06:31.682
and those gangbangers
meeting their early demise,

06:31.766 --> 06:33.476
this is Freeridge. Shit happens.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.104
Yeah, and I'm still alive. I'm
going to focus on the good.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.273
Me too. This money is gonna do a
lot of good for a lot of people.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.193
So if there is a curse,
we're about to reverse it.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.987
Okay. You're right.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.408
There's no curse. And I'm
going to go fill up my glass.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.286

07:40.334 --> 07:42.211
My only option right now is...

07:42.295 --> 07:45.631
is to leave town and cross my fingers
that I can survive on my own.

What does that mean?

- Hmm?

neither are we. Hashtag "blessed."

nothing will fix my hands.

20:17.674 --> 20:20.135
[SIGHS] IBS is really acting up.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.596
But the cramps only last
every couple of minutes.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.432
Oh, no, no, no. Those aren't
cramps. You gotta lie down.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.515
Oh.

20:27.643 --> 20:28.644
[EXCLAIMS]

20:29.311 --> 20:31.897
It's okay, I'm a police
explorer. And no panties!

20:32.314 --> 20:35.192
I had an accident. I peed
a little. A lot. Peed a lot.

20:35.275 --> 20:38.195
Honey, that wasn't pee. Your water
broke. And, from what I can tell,

20:38.278 --> 20:39.988
i.e., the head bustin' out your cooch...

20:40.072 --> 20:42.741
you've been in labor for
hours. She's about to blow.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.790
Your belly is about to become a fupa.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.280
The baby is not due for two more months!

20:46.300 --> 20:48.247
- I give her another ten minutes.
- [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

20:48.330 --> 20:50.374
It's okay. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Careful!

20:52.125 --> 20:55.254
[BREATHING HEAVILY]

20:55.837 --> 20:58.173
Yo! People, I need towels and alcohol!

20:58.257 --> 21:01.677
Get me tequila on the rocks
and Shakira on the stereo!

21:01.760 --> 21:04.680
I am so sorry. I kicked you.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.015
I forget how flexible I am.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.102
Okay, party's over. Everybody, out!

21:10.185 --> 21:12.354
- Wait. Wait, what's happening?
- Amber's having the baby.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.460
What?

21:13.480 --> 21:14.815
- [MARIO] Hold on.
- [JAMAL] Okay.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.566
- [MARIO] Babe, I'm coming.
- Who's Amber?

21:16.650 --> 21:19.027
Do we still get paid for the
whole night if we leave early?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.113
- Who are these people?
- Extras.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.992
What? She didn't have any friends
or family, so I had to improvise.

21:25.070 --> 21:26.320
Fifty bucks plus food isn't a bad gig.

21:26.330 --> 21:27.494
Where'd you get that money?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.454
I know those bills. What
the hell are you doing?

21:29.538 --> 21:32.708
Using against my 25%. It's
permitted in the bylaws.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.418
- There are no bylaws!
- There are bylaws!

21:34.501 --> 21:36.211
- Give me this.
- [GRUNTING]

21:36.295 --> 21:39.798
An ambulance is on its way.
The baby is coming now.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.216
Everyone needs to pray.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.040
Guys, guys. It's the
curse. Don't you see?

21:46.060 --> 21:47.222
This is all building to something.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.932
I found money and Olivia died.

21:49.010 --> 21:50.819
Now we're back at the scene of the crime

21:50.820 --> 21:51.930
with money in hand, which means...

21:51.940 --> 21:54.020
- Someone else is gonna die.
- The baby.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.897
- We have to get rid of it.
- Hold up.

21:55.980 --> 21:58.260
Technically, we just gave
a bunch of cursed money

21:58.270 --> 21:59.280
to all of those extras.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.862
They're actors. No one is
gonna miss them. Let's go!

22:01.945 --> 22:03.655
We don't know how to get rid of a curse!

22:03.739 --> 22:06.033
Okay? Curses have rules. We
can't just throw them away.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.202
Abuelita! The money is cursed!
How do we destroy it?

22:09.286 --> 22:10.912
Burn it! Burn the money!

22:17.961 --> 22:19.254
[SCREAMING] I can't do this!

22:19.338 --> 22:20.731
[EXHALES] You got this, mama! Just...

22:20.732 --> 22:22.020
[SNIFFS] ... smell the flowers...

22:22.060 --> 22:23.670
[BLOWS] ... blow out the candle.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.635
Smell the flowers, blow out the candle.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.262
Tequila! Tequila, Abuelita!

22:32.100 --> 22:33.899
I know we're still getting
to know each other,

22:33.900 --> 22:34.920
but we're gonna make this work.

22:34.936 --> 22:36.772
Okay, I'll be here to take
care of you and the baby.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.482
Me too. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

22:38.565 --> 22:41.735
Me three! You're part of our family now.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.654
Why are your teeth blue?

22:45.697 --> 22:47.115
I'm gonna be a father!

22:47.949 --> 22:50.629
Can we cut the chitchat, people? We
got a log coming down the chute.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.205
Am I pooping? Am I pooping?

22:53.288 --> 22:56.166
- No, no, honey! No! No!
- [WHIMPERS]

22:56.249 --> 22:57.834
Tengo mucha caca. Give me a bedpan.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.711
- How about a salad bowl?
- Okay.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.047
[GRUNTING]

23:02.130 --> 23:03.632
When did we have corn?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.675
You've torn our neighborhood apart.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.803
You've ruined our relationships...

23:08.303 --> 23:10.180
and stolen our youth!

23:11.264 --> 23:12.391
But it's over.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.601
Curse, be gone!

23:14.684 --> 23:16.228
[GROANING]

23:16.686 --> 23:17.686
Wait.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.148
Something's wrong.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.483
[SCREAMS]

23:22.567 --> 23:23.985
[BABY CRIES]

23:25.237 --> 23:28.532
Can I see him? What does
he look like? [CHUCKLES]

23:34.246 --> 23:36.248
[JASMINE] Hmm...

23:37.040 --> 23:38.083
Yes!

23:39.918 --> 23:42.170
[ABUELITA] Stop! Stop! Jamal!

23:42.250 --> 23:44.460
Don't burn the money. The
money is not the thing

23:44.480 --> 23:45.799
that doesn't belong here.

23:45.882 --> 23:46.883
The money is not cursed.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.136
[LAUGHING]

23:50.512 --> 23:53.640
Oh, I'm not gonna lie.
This cake is good!

23:53.723 --> 23:55.016
It just should have been chocolate.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.519
[LAUGHING]

23:57.602 --> 23:59.104
Too soon, man.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.523
Mario...

24:01.606 --> 24:05.152
I want you to know that if
that beautiful baby was yours,

24:05.235 --> 24:06.862
I would've loved it.

24:06.945 --> 24:07.989
But, whoo!

24:07.990 --> 24:10.198
Thank God you're not going
to be a daddy just yet.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.117
- You dodged a bullet.
- We all did.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.828
That girl really didn't know.
And that was a big ass bun...

24:14.911 --> 24:16.580
fully risen. Okay.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.540
The truth always comes out.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.958
- Mm-hmm.
- [JASMINE] Amen.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.127
Hey, I need to tell you something.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.465
You don't have to say it. I know.

24:27.507 --> 24:28.633
Uh...

24:29.259 --> 24:30.719
[KNOCK AT DOOR]

24:32.387 --> 24:35.015
What was your baby mama name
again? Well, your fake baby mama?

24:35.098 --> 24:36.683
[RUBY] Amber. That's a black name.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.395
[CESAR] Hey, it's too soon.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.689
[RUBY] Are you kidding me?
It's not soon enough for you.

24:42.772 --> 24:44.566
[LAUGHING]

24:45.650 --> 24:47.319
