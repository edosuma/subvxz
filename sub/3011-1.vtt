00:19.133 --> 00:21.730
- Hello.
- [Mans Voice] Wanna have a little fun?

00:21.850 --> 00:24.846
- Who's this?
- Tell me your name and I'll tell you mine.

00:24.966 --> 00:26.804
I don't think so. [Farts] 

00:26.884 --> 00:29.721
- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.917
- I didn't think you would hear me.
- No, that popping noise.

00:33.037 --> 00:36.593
Oh. I'm making popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.

00:36.713 --> 00:40.228
- Ooh. What is it?
- It's just a scary movie.

00:40.348 --> 00:42.226
- Do you like scary movies?
- Mm-hmm.

00:42.346 --> 00:45.422
- What's your favorite?
- Mm, I don't know.

00:45.502 --> 00:47.341
Think.

00:47.420 --> 00:50.816
Oh, I know. Um, Kazaam,
the one where Shaq plays a genie.

00:50.895 --> 00:54.132
- That's not a horror movie.
- Well, you haven't seen Shaq act.

00:54.252 --> 00:55.811
[Popping] 

00:55.930 --> 00:58.886
- Hey, you have a nice voice.
- Thanks.

00:59.006 --> 01:01.044
You never did tell me your name.

01:01.164 --> 01:03.282
Why do you wanna know my name?

01:03.402 --> 01:05.958
Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

01:07.597 --> 01:09.634
What--
What did you say?

01:09.714 --> 01:11.872
Nice breasts.

01:11.991 --> 01:13.789
Look, what do you want?

01:13.909 --> 01:16.467
I wanna see
what your insides look like.

01:16.586 --> 01:18.863
Well-- Well, then,
turn to page 54.

01:18.943 --> 01:20.502
Oh.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.419
Hey, nice.

01:24.176 --> 01:28.132
Listen, asshole, you've had your fun,
now you better stop or else.

01:28.252 --> 01:31.169
- Or else what?
- Or else my boyfriends
gonna be here any minute,

01:31.289 --> 01:33.247
and he's black
and he'll kick your ass.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.165
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:35.245 --> 01:37.282
You mean the one who wears makeup
and dresses like a woman?

01:37.402 --> 01:40.279
- How did you know?
- Turn the porch lights on.

01:46.192 --> 01:49.147
Help! Help!

01:49.227 --> 01:53.503
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.
I mean, I've fucked him a couple
of times, but that's it.

01:53.582 --> 01:56.699
- [Squealing] 
- Look, I'm calling the cops.

01:56.779 --> 01:58.896
Go ahead. Call the cops.

01:58.976 --> 02:01.893
But you might wanna
check the back door first.

02:02.013 --> 02:03.930
You forgot to lock it.

02:13.599 --> 02:15.717
[Doorbell Chimes] 

02:26.025 --> 02:27.862
Take that, you psycho!

02:29.261 --> 02:30.819
[Groaning] 

02:30.939 --> 02:32.976
I cant feel my legs.

02:33.057 --> 02:35.454
I think my arm is broken.

02:35.534 --> 02:38.970
- Sorry.
- I want my mommy.

02:41.886 --> 02:43.725
Hello, Drew.

03:00.505 --> 03:02.302
Oh, God!

03:04.020 --> 03:06.098
[Screams] 

03:59.835 --> 04:03.830
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Ugh!

04:03.950 --> 04:06.428
Daddy!

04:06.508 --> 04:08.745
- Daddy!
- [Groans] 

04:08.825 --> 04:11.822
Daddy, no! No!

04:13.699 --> 04:16.576
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

04:28.761 --> 04:31.199
[Keyboard Clicking] 

04:31.279 --> 04:33.116
[Rustling] 

04:42.026 --> 04:46.621
[Screams] Bobby, what are you doing?
My dads in the other room.

04:46.701 --> 04:49.257
It just occurred to me. I never
climbed through your window before.

04:49.377 --> 04:52.773
Now that you got it out of your system,
Bobby, you have to leave.

04:52.853 --> 04:54.051
Why?

04:54.171 --> 04:56.329
Shh. Come on.

04:56.449 --> 04:58.287
What's going on in there?

04:58.366 --> 05:01.523
Ow! Daddy's head is stuck.
Unstick Daddy's head.

05:01.643 --> 05:04.479
- [Groaning] 
- Dad, can you knock?

05:04.599 --> 05:08.834
- Knock?
I thought I heard screaming in here.
- No. No, you didn't, Dad.

05:08.914 --> 05:11.431
Well, it could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

05:11.551 --> 05:13.310
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

05:13.389 --> 05:15.348
I gotta leave town
for a couple of days.

05:15.468 --> 05:18.104
No big deal. Just that new business
I started with those Colombian guys?

05:18.184 --> 05:20.861
- Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

05:20.981 --> 05:23.218
Well, there's a problem.
Some money went missing.

05:23.297 --> 05:25.256
And apparently,
some legs are gonna get broken.

05:25.376 --> 05:27.653
It's just better if I lay low
for a couple of days.

05:27.772 --> 05:30.050
- If the cops raid the place--
- I never heard of you.

05:30.170 --> 05:32.407
- And don't forget--
- To flush your stash.

05:32.487 --> 05:35.204
Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

05:35.324 --> 05:37.241
that I left you a little something
in the coffee can.

05:37.361 --> 05:40.797
- Dad--
- But you have to remember to step
on it before you sell it.

05:40.917 --> 05:43.713
- Now, what are you
gonna cut it with?
- Um, baking--

05:43.793 --> 05:45.632
Baking soda.
Not baking powder.

05:45.711 --> 05:48.628
Because baking powder guys
will have muffins growing
out of their nose.

05:48.707 --> 05:50.865
You love that joke,
don't you, honey?

05:50.946 --> 05:54.022
You've loved that joke
since you were two years old.

05:54.142 --> 05:56.139
- Okay, well--
- Okay, I love you.

05:56.259 --> 05:58.137
- I love you.
- Have a good trip.

05:58.217 --> 06:00.574
- Bye.
- Bye. Whew!

06:00.655 --> 06:02.771
Is the coast clear?

06:02.851 --> 06:05.888
Oh, Cindy, that nightgown.

06:06.008 --> 06:09.045
That was close. God!

06:12.120 --> 06:16.795
I was, uh, home watching
The Exorcist, and it
got me thinking about you.

06:16.915 --> 06:20.830
If this is about the time
I puked green slime
and masturbated with a crucifix--

06:20.950 --> 06:23.028
It was my first keg party, Bobby.

06:23.107 --> 06:27.422
No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cut out.

06:27.542 --> 06:30.299
So you thought you would just climb
through my window...

06:30.419 --> 06:32.336
and we would
play bump-bump?

06:32.456 --> 06:34.415
I was kind of hoping
to get my balls licked,

06:34.535 --> 06:37.092
but I wouldn't wanna break
your little underwear rule,
now, would I?

06:37.211 --> 06:40.367
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?

06:43.565 --> 06:46.321
Okay. But just for a minute.

06:51.554 --> 06:54.352
[Soft Rock] 

07:00.983 --> 07:03.181
What the--

07:03.261 --> 07:05.139
Wrong set.

07:08.575 --> 07:12.010
Bobby! Oh, Bobby!

07:12.091 --> 07:15.087
I don't wanna wait
for our lives to be over

07:15.207 --> 07:17.245
- No, Bobby, don't.
- Ow!

07:19.402 --> 07:22.079
Jeez.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.636
Yeah, my dad.

07:24.756 --> 07:29.630
Okay, stud,
you have to go now.

07:32.467 --> 07:34.864
Oh, um,
about the sex stuff?

07:34.984 --> 07:37.222
I was only half serious.
I don't wanna rush you or anything.

07:37.341 --> 07:40.457
Hey, would you settle
for PG-13?

07:40.537 --> 07:43.054
What's that?

07:44.413 --> 07:45.611
Oh, jeez!

07:45.731 --> 07:48.169
-[Crash] 
- Good night, Bobby.

07:53.323 --> 07:56.359
- [Laughing] 
- Shorty, you are so loud.

07:56.479 --> 07:59.036
And make sure you take
your behind to class today.

07:59.115 --> 08:02.272
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

08:02.352 --> 08:04.549
It is when you got
the munchies.

08:04.669 --> 08:08.385
- See, that's why
you such a dumb-ass.
- Your mother.

08:08.505 --> 08:12.300
You my brother.
That's your mother too, jackass.

08:12.420 --> 08:15.536
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, your fathers stupid.

08:15.657 --> 08:18.094
So? I don't know him.

08:18.213 --> 08:20.930
Yeah, me neither.

08:21.050 --> 08:24.645
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

08:26.165 --> 08:28.801
- We're gonna be late.
- Wait. There's Buffy.

08:28.921 --> 08:32.116
[Grunts] I don't know why
you hang out with her.

08:32.197 --> 08:34.433
- She is such a ho.
- Why do you say that?

08:34.554 --> 08:36.991
Cause I've seen her.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.788
- My friend Sean
had a pool party this summer.
- Sean?

08:39.908 --> 08:41.785
You know, Puff Daddy?

08:41.905 --> 08:44.302
Anyway, everybody was drinking
Cristal champagne.

08:44.383 --> 08:47.339
And then it started to get wild,
and people were getting freaky
in the pool and stuff.

08:47.459 --> 08:51.375
I look over and there was
your girl getting buck wild
in the Jacuzzi.

08:51.494 --> 08:53.013
So?

08:53.093 --> 08:56.089
With a backup dancer.

08:56.209 --> 08:58.047
I mean, that's nasty.

08:58.127 --> 09:00.205
That's-That's lower
than the security guard.

09:00.325 --> 09:04.000
At least security can get you backstage.
She don't love herself.

09:04.079 --> 09:07.196
Bye, Daddy.
- I don't know. II think
Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

09:07.316 --> 09:10.513
She is as fake
as Press-onnails.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.829
Hey, baby girl!

09:14.388 --> 09:16.305
What is up,
my sister?

09:16.386 --> 09:18.902
- Bye, Mr. Gilmore.
- Bye!

09:19.022 --> 09:20.701
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

09:21.979 --> 09:25.655
Do you like what you see

09:25.774 --> 09:28.091
It's all about the money

09:28.171 --> 09:30.010
[Girl] 
Hey, Cindy!

09:32.926 --> 09:35.883
- I love this color.
- Let me see that.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.396
- Oh, you guys should
not use this brand.
- Why not?

09:41.476 --> 09:44.314
- Because they test
their products on animals.
- So?

09:44.433 --> 09:48.788
Look, have you seen what they do
to those poor animals?

09:50.585 --> 09:54.181
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

09:54.301 --> 09:57.417
I'd like to feed all the hungry,
little children of the world.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.934
Iâ€™d much rather help my fellow man
than some animal.

10:00.054 --> 10:01.852
- Spare a dollar?
- Get away from me, you bum!

10:01.972 --> 10:04.529
Buffy! Can't you see
he's just hungry?

10:04.649 --> 10:07.446
Here you go, sir.
A nice sandwich.

10:08.485 --> 10:11.881
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch!

10:11.960 --> 10:14.159
Ow!

10:14.238 --> 10:17.234
God.
Look at this place.

10:17.354 --> 10:19.632
It's a circus.

10:19.711 --> 10:24.227
Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author of 
the book, You're Dead, I'm Rich.

10:24.306 --> 10:26.463
A small college town
is in shock...

10:26.543 --> 10:28.662
after the unthinkable
has happened:

10:28.781 --> 10:31.658
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead--

10:31.737 --> 10:33.935
- That's it. Two teens dead...
- [Gunshot] 

10:34.055 --> 10:36.292
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

10:36.371 --> 10:39.768
- Its times like these--
- Police are combing
the area for clues.

10:39.888 --> 10:42.005
There are no witnesses
available at this time.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.923
There are no suspects
in custody.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.840
Police are asking anyone
to come forward.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.997
Reporting live for Black TV.
White folks are dead and we're
getting the fuck out of here!

10:49.077 --> 10:52.154
Grab your shit
and lets go, motherfucker!

10:55.309 --> 10:58.666
Hey, do you think the press is gonna
wanna talk to us?

10:58.786 --> 11:03.181
Oh, girl, no. The press
only wants to interview the most
ignorant person they can find.

11:03.301 --> 11:06.857
I'm on TV! Oh, shit!
First Cops, now this!

11:06.936 --> 11:08.774
Oh, man, I'm gonna be
a star, son!

11:08.854 --> 11:13.369
- What can you tell us about Drew?
- Well, she had the fat ass.

11:13.449 --> 11:16.325
- I mean, it was like bang!
- How close were you to the victim?

11:16.405 --> 11:18.883
Real close.
Until the roofies wore off.

11:18.962 --> 11:20.920
Then she woke up talking about
pressing charges.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.038
So I just pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.195
What would have been
your last words to Drew?

11:25.315 --> 11:28.232
Run, bitch! Run!

11:31.188 --> 11:34.504
Hey, yo, dawg.
Does this shirt make me look gay?

11:34.584 --> 11:36.422
No, man.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.496
What about now?

11:40.577 --> 11:42.975
- Nah. Yeah.
- Cool?

11:43.054 --> 11:45.331
Here. Take one, guys.
Don't forget: elections Tuesday.

11:45.411 --> 11:47.808
Don't forget:
election's Tuesday.

11:47.928 --> 11:51.964
Ah! Goddamn it!
Son of a bitch!

11:52.044 --> 11:54.721
What's the matter, honey?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.639
My report card.

11:59.115 --> 12:01.074
Well, at least
you got one A.

12:01.153 --> 12:04.349
Yeah. I did, huh?

12:04.429 --> 12:07.905
- You're so smart.
- [Moaning] 

12:08.025 --> 12:10.263
- Hey, has anybody seen Bobby?
- Nah.

12:10.383 --> 12:12.660
You know what?
That kid is always late.

12:12.739 --> 12:14.977
I don't get it.
He lives so close.

12:15.098 --> 12:17.854
[Rock] 

12:24.365 --> 12:27.163
See you later,
Hairy Mama, Bubba, Jim,

12:27.242 --> 12:30.040
Big Jim, Little Jim,
Slim Jim, everybody.

12:30.119 --> 12:32.716
I'll see you later. Ciao, Ding.
All right.

12:38.829 --> 12:41.586
Damn, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.

12:41.666 --> 12:44.063
- Iâ€™d sure like to get in them pants.
- Really?

12:44.182 --> 12:46.620
Yeah. What size are these?

12:46.740 --> 12:48.617
[Bobby] 
Hey, guys.

12:48.697 --> 12:51.415
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, baby.

12:51.535 --> 12:53.971
- How you doing?
- Good.

12:54.090 --> 12:56.688
- You guys see all
the reporters out there?
- Yeah.

12:56.768 --> 12:59.005
Saying that girl Drew Decker
got killed last night.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.283
- You know what? I think I knew her.
- Really?

13:01.363 --> 13:04.279
- She had a brother named Steve?
- Yeah.

13:04.399 --> 13:06.876
Long hair, pretty little mouth,
perfect ass?

13:06.996 --> 13:09.754
- That was her.
- Nah, I was talking about Steve.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.750
Whatever happened
to him?

13:11.830 --> 13:14.628
Do you guys think its strange
that she got killed...

13:14.747 --> 13:17.863
exactly one year
after we,

13:17.943 --> 13:20.181
you know,
killed that guy?

13:20.261 --> 13:22.538
Hey, Cindy,
that was an accident.

13:22.617 --> 13:24.456
Was it, Greg?

13:41.037 --> 13:43.634
Would you look
at what they're doing?

13:43.754 --> 13:45.831
When are we gonna do
stuff like that, huh?

13:45.911 --> 13:47.788
One day.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.346
- You like that, baby?
- Yeah, that's different.

13:50.425 --> 13:52.622
- You like that?
- Oh, I love that.

13:52.702 --> 13:54.980
Oh, I love
when you play with my ass.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.897
I'm not playing
with your ass.

13:59.335 --> 14:02.771
- Ray!
- Oh, my bad.

14:02.891 --> 14:06.846
Come on, man!

-[Zipper Unzips] 
- Bobby, what are you doing?

15:08.933 --> 15:11.611
I just want you to touch it.
Just touch it. Come on.

15:11.691 --> 15:13.569
- Uh--
-Just a little bit. Come on.

15:13.688 --> 15:15.566
Whoo!

Oh, my God! Shit!

15:35.223 --> 15:38.499
God, Cindy--
Oh, shit!

15:49.486 --> 15:51.804
- [Ray] Oh, my God.
- What was that?

15:51.924 --> 15:53.881
I think
we hit something.

15:58.037 --> 16:00.713
Oh, man!

16:00.794 --> 16:04.509
Bobby, look at my car, man!
My dads gonna freak!

16:04.629 --> 16:07.226
[Bobby] I didn't see it.
It came out of nowhere.

16:07.345 --> 16:09.823
- Oh, my God, we hit a boot.
- Where's the foot?

16:09.943 --> 16:12.219
I don't know.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.096
Where the--

16:15.216 --> 16:17.334
- [Screams] 
- Its a body!

16:17.454 --> 16:19.331
- Oh, shit, is he alive?
- I don't know.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.369
- Well, check it out.
- I cant.

16:21.489 --> 16:24.446
- Shit!
- We have to call the police.

16:24.565 --> 16:27.482
- No way. I ain't going to jail.
- We have to!

16:27.602 --> 16:29.800
Cindy, do you know what they do
to young boys in prison?

16:29.880 --> 16:32.756
And all those sex-starved
convicts just waiting
for a fresh piece of meat.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.793
Hey, you're right, Cindy.
Maybe we should call the police.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.109
[Greg] Oh, yeah,
That's a great idea, Ray.
But what about Brenda, huh?

16:38.229 --> 16:40.027
You think she wants
to go to jail?

16:40.147 --> 16:42.025
This is manslaughter, okay?
We're all gonna fry for this.

16:42.105 --> 16:45.701
- We're looking at 10 to 15 years.
- Shut up, Bobby!

16:45.780 --> 16:48.617
- Its okay. I'm fine.
-Alcohol all over.
- We're in so much trouble.

16:48.698 --> 16:51.533
- I'm fine.
-[Brenda] Don't blame
that shit on me, Ray.

16:51.653 --> 16:55.489
- Look, well get rid of the body.
- Unnecessary.

16:55.570 --> 16:58.166
-[Brenda] Now you're thinking.
- We'll dump him in the ocean.
- Not the ocean, the pier.

16:58.286 --> 17:00.283
- Guess I'll be leaving now.
-[Greg] That's a great idea.

17:00.364 --> 17:02.321
- What about the alcohol?
- Well get rid of it.

17:02.441 --> 17:04.358
[Bobby] Come on. It'll be all right.

17:04.439 --> 17:06.596
- Come on. Hurry up. Lets go.
- Put him in the trunk.

17:06.715 --> 17:09.153
- I wont have anything to do with this!
-[Greg] Shut up!

17:09.233 --> 17:12.549
Cindy, come on.
Well just pretend it never happened.

17:12.628 --> 17:15.744
You know, like the time we got drunk
and we went down on each other.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.742
- I'll get his arm.
- I'll grab. I'll grab his other arm.
- I'll grab his ass.

17:18.862 --> 17:21.978
Well take him down to Williamson Cove
and we'll dump him in there.

17:22.098 --> 17:23.935
The sharks'll take care
of the evidence.

17:24.016 --> 17:26.013
Oh, my God,
someone's coming.

17:26.093 --> 17:29.850
- Oh, shit. Its Shorty.
- Brenda, take care of him.

17:31.527 --> 17:35.882
[Rap Playing On Radio] 

17:36.001 --> 17:38.919
Shorty, I know you ain't driving
without no papers.

17:38.998 --> 17:41.994
I got papers,
blunts, bongs,

17:42.114 --> 17:44.472
all the ingredients
to make a high niggard pie.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.626
- Hey, yo, can I help you?
- Yo, what's up, Ray?

17:49.706 --> 17:52.503
- Yo, son, you all need jumper cables?
- Nah, we're cool.

17:52.583 --> 17:56.178
Oh, good, cause I left
my roach clip at home.

17:56.258 --> 17:59.015
- Go home, Shorty.
- Yeah, I-I'll see you later.

17:59.095 --> 18:00.853
Peace, Ray.

18:00.972 --> 18:03.370
- Get the trunk closed.
-[Buffy] It won't close.

18:03.490 --> 18:06.007
- I'll do it.
- [Groaning] 

18:06.126 --> 18:08.924
[Shorty Laughing] 

18:29.579 --> 18:32.496
Hold on. Hold on. Put him down.
He's heavy. Oh, God.

18:34.613 --> 18:38.170
Okay, look. On three we dump him
over the ledge.

18:38.290 --> 18:40.606
Wait, wait, wait.
Shouldn't we at least check his wallet?

18:40.726 --> 18:44.202
- For what?
- Shit, he might have some money.

18:44.322 --> 18:47.119
We already committed murder.
We might as well rob his ass.

18:47.199 --> 18:49.835
- I'll take the credit cards.
- I want his jewelry.
- I'm gonna take his drawers.

18:49.916 --> 18:54.749
- [All Shouting] 
- Get off!. Hey, yo, get off!.
His drawers are mine! Yo!

18:54.869 --> 18:58.345
- [Chuckling] I got me a gold ring.
- Credit cards.

18:58.465 --> 19:01.822
- All right, lets get him in the water.
- I don't think I can, Greg.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.259
- Its not too late.
- Shut up, okay?

19:04.378 --> 19:08.334
- Christ, already. I'll do it.
-Just get him in the water.

19:08.414 --> 19:11.211
Okay. One, two,

19:11.291 --> 19:13.128
three.

19:17.124 --> 19:20.560
Right now we make a pact.
We take this to our grave.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.158
-Agreed?
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

19:22.238 --> 19:24.115
- Agreed?
- [Brenda, Bobby] Agreed.

19:24.196 --> 19:27.152
Say it, Cindy. Say it!

19:27.232 --> 19:30.029
We take this to our grave. Say it!

19:30.109 --> 19:32.625
- [Gagging] 
- We take this to our grave. Say it.

19:32.745 --> 19:34.543
Greg, chill. Come on.
You're hurting her.

19:34.663 --> 19:37.540
We take this
to our grave. Ow.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.177
And we never
mention this again.

19:40.258 --> 19:42.135
Mention what?

19:42.214 --> 19:46.570
- The guy we just killed.
- Well, you just mentioned it, Greg.

19:46.689 --> 19:48.367
Starting now!

19:48.447 --> 19:50.605
Stupid bitch, man.

19:50.685 --> 19:54.320
- God. I hate him.
- Its gonna be okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

19:54.440 --> 19:58.795
I promise. Just touch it again.
Come on. Please.

20:01.751 --> 20:05.028
- You have to move on, Cindy.
That's all behind us now.
- Exactly.

20:05.108 --> 20:07.425
- Its a coincidence.
- Gregss right, Cindy.

20:07.504 --> 20:10.142
I mean, what do you think
we're in, a horror movie?

20:10.222 --> 20:13.737
Yeah, you guys are right.
If we were,

20:13.857 --> 20:18.372
they'd probably cast some dingbat
like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me.

20:18.492 --> 20:22.127
Yeah, or they'd cast people
in their late twenties,
early thirties to play us.

20:24.366 --> 20:27.841
-[Bell Rings] 
- Kenny, get the camera ready.
Here. Hold my gum.

20:29.839 --> 20:32.995
- Sheriff, Sheriff,
can I get a statement?
- No comment.

20:33.115 --> 20:38.149
Damn. Who do I have to screw around here
to get a stupid story?

Hey! Hey, no running.

Hi. Gail Hailstorm.
Field Reporter, Hard Story.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.730
Special Officer Doofy.

20:54.849 --> 20:58.646
Oh, hi, Doofy. Doofy, listen.
Is there a problem on campus?

20:58.725 --> 21:00.842
- No comment. No comment.
- Okay. Okay.

21:00.962 --> 21:04.479
You know, you look awfully young
to be a police officer.

21:04.558 --> 21:06.955
- I'm 25 and a half years old.
- Ooh!

21:07.035 --> 21:09.153
- Yeah, that's this many.
- Ah, so big.

21:09.273 --> 21:11.350
Yeah. That's big.

21:11.430 --> 21:13.948
- Well, you don't look
a day over 12.
- [Chuckles] 

21:14.027 --> 21:17.584
Except for the big head
and glazed-over look in your eyes.

21:17.704 --> 21:21.139
- Ooh, was that drool?
- Yeah. I forgot to swallow.

21:21.218 --> 21:24.495
Don't worry,
cause I never forget.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.413
- [Both Laughing] 
- [Farts] 

21:26.532 --> 21:28.850
- Would you remind me
not to do that again?
- Sorry.

21:28.930 --> 21:31.806
[Man Over P.A.] 
Due to the recent tragedy, the sheriff
and me, your principal,

21:31.926 --> 21:34.244
will be questioning all students
throughout the day.

21:34.364 --> 21:37.121
Wow. Sounds like we've got the makings
of a serial killer on our hands.

21:37.241 --> 21:39.837
Yeah, I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

21:39.957 --> 21:43.752
Hey, Doofy, what do you say you and I
go inside my van over there...

21:43.872 --> 21:46.429
and, uh, get to know
each other a little better?

21:46.549 --> 21:50.145
- Would you like that?
Yeah, that van right there.
- That van?

21:50.265 --> 21:52.622
- [Chuckles] 
- Yeah.

21:52.703 --> 21:56.058
- Yeah, okay, lets go. Come on.
- Oh!

21:56.178 --> 22:00.014
A terrible tragedy
and an unbearable loss.

22:00.093 --> 22:04.009
Its days like today
that we need prayer in school.

22:04.089 --> 22:08.884
It starts to unravel
the very moral fabric
of our society.

22:09.003 --> 22:11.120
Here you go, baby.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.038
Go to your daddy.

22:13.118 --> 22:15.435
Oh!

22:15.515 --> 22:18.512
[Chuckles] 
I'll see you after class.

22:18.631 --> 22:20.469
- Sweet!
- All right!

22:20.549 --> 22:24.225
Okay, class, who would like to give
their oral presentation first?

22:24.345 --> 22:27.062
- Oh!
- Anybody?

22:27.182 --> 22:30.058
- Yes!
- Anybody else?

22:37.291 --> 22:39.647
- Okay. Can I start?
- Yeah.

22:39.767 --> 22:42.843
Okay, my presentation
is on the First Amendment.

22:42.963 --> 22:47.199
And it began on May 25, 1787 in Philly
with George Washington.

22:47.318 --> 22:49.116
And it states, and I quote,

22:49.236 --> 22:52.312
When our Founding Fathers argued the passage
of our glorious Constitution--

22:52.432 --> 22:55.309
[Heather Continuing] 

23:39.937 --> 23:43.333
The First Amendment gives us the right
to say what we want--

23:43.453 --> 23:46.249
Oh, shut the fuck up!

23:46.369 --> 23:49.486
- So, who's next?
- [Putting] 

23:49.606 --> 23:52.482
Uh, Cindy Campbell.

23:52.602 --> 23:55.718
Isn't she the daughter
of, well, you know--

23:55.838 --> 23:59.235

- Old Mrs. --

23:59.314 --> 24:02.071

the one and only--

24:02.190 --> 24:05.427
The one and only.
[Clears Throat] 

24:05.547 --> 24:09.023

24:09.103 --> 24:13.138
- Thanks, Doofy.
- Its Special Officer Doofy today,
Cindy.

24:13.257 --> 24:17.453
Now, Cindy, Sheriff has some questions
that he would like to ask you today.

24:17.573 --> 24:20.929
- What is that... god-awful smell?
- I don't know.

24:21.009 --> 24:22.287
I got a poopie.

24:23.406 --> 24:26.203
Did you just say
that you went poopie?

24:26.282 --> 24:29.240
- Yeah. It was good.
-[Sheriff] Mm.

24:29.319 --> 24:32.315
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

24:32.435 --> 24:34.833
- Thank you, Doofy.
- [Doofy] Okay.

24:34.912 --> 24:37.270
You should now go back
to Special Ed.

24:37.349 --> 24:40.826
- Okay. Salute.
- Maybe a change of underwear, son.

24:40.905 --> 24:43.983
- Bye, Doofy.
- Bye, Cindy.

24:44.102 --> 24:46.739
- How are you, Cindy?
- Fine.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.616
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Bloated, constipated.

24:49.695 --> 24:53.131
Got a boil on my ass
the size of a walnut.
You know, the usual.

24:53.251 --> 24:56.007
Cindy, I want to ask you
some questions about Drew Decker.

24:57.726 --> 25:00.363
- I didn't really know her.
- Oh, come on. Sure you do.

25:00.483 --> 25:02.720
No. I mean,
I didn't really know her.

25:02.840 --> 25:06.356
I've been in this game a long time.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

25:06.435 --> 25:09.792
Tell me about Drew. What
was she like in bed, Cindy?

25:10.951 --> 25:13.947
Tried to get you.
Its an old police trick.

25:14.067 --> 25:17.463
Its an old police trick.
You didn't fall for it.
Good for you, kid.

25:17.544 --> 25:19.380

25:20.300 --> 25:22.737

Damn.

25:40.915 --> 25:44.112
Yo, Greg, what's up?
You gonna hit the showers or what?

25:44.191 --> 25:48.187
No, man. I think I'm gonna work out,

Who did this? Huh?

It's a shame how she died.

- Yeah, she used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.

26:54.390 --> 26:57.905

27:42.653 --> 27:44.571
Someone just trying
to fuck with us.

27:44.691 --> 27:47.208

- What you doin', son?
- Nothin'... Just chillin'... killin'...

39:12.047 --> 39:14.565
True. True.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.683
So you think
Bobby did it?

39:19.999 --> 39:22.916
I don't know.
But he was there, Buffy.

39:23.036 --> 39:26.910
I knew there had to be something.
He just too perfect.

39:26.991 --> 39:30.187
Handsome, smart,
good in bed.

39:30.307 --> 39:34.142

- Uh--

Hey, Cindy.
Got your ice pack for your hand.

No, no, that's okay, Doofy.

Hey, we are gonna get that guy
you dumped in the water. Yeah.

Night, Cindy.

39:54.958 --> 39:56.356
Buffy, you told him?

39:56.436 --> 39:59.392
The moron overheard a conversation
Greg and I were having.

39:59.473 --> 40:01.790
- Yeah, but what
if he says something?
- Who's gonna believe...

40:01.871 --> 40:04.467
a retarded retard
like him anyway?

40:04.546 --> 40:06.905

40:14.216 --> 40:16.494
- Guess what.
- No!

40:16.613 --> 40:18.570
- You got the wrong guy.
- No!

40:18.690 --> 40:20.488
- Doofy!
- Its not Bobby.

40:20.607 --> 40:22.406
- Who is this?
- [Dial Tone] 

40:22.526 --> 40:25.083

Hello?

40:36.350 --> 40:40.825
I said don't disturb me
while I'm cleaning my room!

40:46.458 --> 40:48.855
I heard Bobby got out
this morning.

40:48.975 --> 40:52.092
I haven't seen him around.
Is he pissed?

40:52.212 --> 40:56.087
You mean since
you branded him the Candy man?
No. His heart is broken.

40:56.206 --> 40:59.123
Yo, son. Its like
I seen this all before.

40:59.202 --> 41:01.121
They had a killer at
your old high school, Shorty?

41:01.241 --> 41:03.038
No, it was in this movie Scream.

41:03.158 --> 41:05.476
Same dialogue and everything.
This is ill.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.393
- How did it end?
- I don't know.

41:07.513 --> 41:10.510
Some niggas started shooting
up in the movie theater,
so we just broke out.

41:10.590 --> 41:14.146
- No doubt.
- Okay, I say we all
just stick together.

41:14.265 --> 41:16.184
Tonight everyone
meet at my house.

41:16.304 --> 41:19.739
And bring some friends. But don't tell everyone.
Try to keep it quiet.

41:19.859 --> 41:21.178
Okay.

41:21.297 --> 41:26.092
Yo! Party at Cindy's house!
Drunk white women for everybody!

41:27.609 --> 41:32.204
Ray, if you see Bobby,
tell him I love him.

41:32.284 --> 41:36.320
Okay. If I see Bobby,
I'll tell him I love him.

41:43.032 --> 41:45.469
-Jesus!
- Its okay. It's all right.
It's just me, baby.

41:45.589 --> 41:48.465
- What, you don't still
think It's me, do you?
- No.

41:48.585 --> 41:50.583
It's just that somebody
did try to kill me.

41:50.703 --> 41:54.858
- And the police said
I scared him away.
- I know. He called me last night.

41:54.938 --> 41:58.214
You see, it couldn't have been me.
I was in jail last night. Remember?

42:00.372 --> 42:02.249
You're the best.

42:02.329 --> 42:04.687
I'm sorry.
Please understand.

42:04.766 --> 42:07.483
Understand what?
That my girlfriend would rather
call me a killer than touch me?

42:07.603 --> 42:09.402
- That's not true, Bobby.
- Then what is it?

42:09.521 --> 42:11.838
What is it?
She's gone and she's not coming back.

42:11.958 --> 42:16.153
- Its been over a year, Cindy.
- But Ginger was such an important
part of the Spice Girls.

42:16.273 --> 42:19.350
- Oh, you gotta move on, baby.
- Oh!

has been tragic, but, uh--

- Yes, Miss Thunderstorm.
- Have they found
Cindy Campbell's father?

42:46.118 --> 42:48.076
- No.
- Isn't he a suspect?

42:48.196 --> 42:50.233
That is classified information.
Where are you getting that?

42:50.353 --> 42:53.909
I'm sorry, but my sources
are strictly confidential, Sheriff.

there is a killer in town...

43:28.908 --> 43:32.105
and the police have asked us to give you
the following safety tips.

43:32.225 --> 43:34.301
Stay in well-lit areas.

43:34.421 --> 43:36.699
Do not travel alone
whenever possible.

43:36.819 --> 43:38.657
Always wipe front to back.

43:38.736 --> 43:41.173
And remember, never, ever
believe someone...

43:41.293 --> 43:44.410
when they tell you
that shaving your pubic hair...

43:44.489 --> 43:47.327
will rid you
of crab infestation.

43:47.407 --> 43:51.202
Now, I understand
this is a difficult time
for you young ladies.

43:51.283 --> 43:54.159

to come to my office to talk,

Take off your bra if you'd like.

44:23.364 --> 44:26.162
No, thanks.

What can I do for you,
Cindy?

44:28.399 --> 44:32.394
I need to talk.
See, I have this problem...

44:32.474 --> 44:34.671
and I don't know
who to tell.

- Huh?

Then what is it?

44:47.456 --> 44:50.494
I have a terrible secret.

44:50.613 --> 44:53.409
Well, Cindy, we all have
our little secrets.

44:56.286 --> 44:58.603
Sometimes we do things
we're not so proud of.

44:58.723 --> 45:01.240
Some for money,

45:01.360 --> 45:04.676
others to gain the athletic edge
on the competition.

45:04.757 --> 45:07.233
Sometimes those secrets
come back to haunt us.

45:07.313 --> 45:09.270
- Aah!
- Do you know what I mean?

45:09.391 --> 45:13.865

kill you then?

messing with us.

just, like, making out...

so he went to go check it,

01:05:11.147 --> 01:05:13.504
[Rapping] 
Don't even contest
Cause Iâ€™ll make you undress

01:05:13.584 --> 01:05:16.061
Like porn dancers
waitin' at the front door for an answer

01:05:16.181 --> 01:05:19.178
Hey, yo, I'm sick of artificial MCs
like silicone titties

01:05:19.298 --> 01:05:21.655
Hey, yo, check it, yo.
Fuck a cheap ball

01:05:21.735 --> 01:05:23.652
I wanna smoke Cheech and Chong

01:05:23.733 --> 01:05:26.090
And if I wanna fuck long,
I let my ding-a-long, hit the bong

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:28.527
And then the song,
Always pass the dutchie to the left

01:05:28.607 --> 01:05:31.404
Because the right way
is wrong
[Cackling] 

01:05:31.484 --> 01:05:35.039
- Whoo-hoo!
- I got one. I got one.
Here it goes. Ready?

01:05:35.158 --> 01:05:37.836
I'm gonna slash and gash
Cut another hole in your ass

01:05:37.956 --> 01:05:40.393
I spill blood on the walls
then play tennis with your balls

01:05:40.513 --> 01:05:42.351
If the phone rings
don't answer the call

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:44.388
Gonna slit your throat
fuck you like a goat

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:47.345
Peel your foreskin off
and make a winter coat
Peace!

01:05:49.702 --> 01:05:52.419
Yo!

01:05:52.539 --> 01:05:56.374
That was the illest rhyme
I ever seen, son!

01:05:58.332 --> 01:06:02.487
Bobby... where were you tonight?

01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:05.723
- What?
- I was just curious.

01:06:05.843 --> 01:06:07.681
What took you so long
to get here?

01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:09.759
Why you so curious?

01:06:11.277 --> 01:06:13.115
I don't know.

01:06:13.195 --> 01:06:15.393
I thought it would fit
the 90s horror clichÃ©...

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:18.029
if you turned out
to be the killer.

01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:20.746
Oh, so, what? You think
I killed Buffy and Greg?

01:06:22.584 --> 01:06:24.541
Buffy and Greg are dead?

01:06:25.821 --> 01:06:27.458
- I thought you knew that.
- Oh, my God!

01:06:27.578 --> 01:06:30.615
Bobby, turn around!
Its the killer!

01:06:30.735 --> 01:06:34.530
[Screaming] 

01:06:44.238 --> 01:06:46.077
- Cindy!
- [Gasps] 

01:06:46.197 --> 01:06:49.153
- Oh, my God! Bobby! Bobby!
- Cindy. Help me.

01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:53.906
- Bobby, its okay.
- Gimme the gun. Gimme-

01:06:54.947 --> 01:06:57.423
Its gonna be okay, Bobby.

01:06:58.701 --> 01:07:01.618
Yo, wait for me!
There's a killer in the house!

01:07:01.738 --> 01:07:03.576
There's ass, blood
and guts everywhere!

01:07:03.696 --> 01:07:05.933
Someone done gone crazy,
son!

01:07:06.013 --> 01:07:10.448
- [Chuckling] 
We all go a little crazy sometimes.
- Bobby, no!

01:07:11.566 --> 01:07:13.684
Oh, shit, son!

01:07:13.804 --> 01:07:16.560

[Inhaling] 

01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:24.751
You wanna hit this shit?

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.665
Ketchup.

01:07:30.744 --> 01:07:32.981
Just like my mom puts on
her spaghetti, baby.

01:07:35.059 --> 01:07:37.856
Oh, my God! Ray, youâ€™ve gotta help me!
Bobbyâ€™s gone crazy!

01:07:39.254 --> 01:07:41.292
[Girls Voice] 
Surprise!

01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:44.089
- [Killers Voice] Surprise, Cindy!
- [Gasps] 

01:07:55.595 --> 01:07:57.593
Why are you doing this, Bobby?

01:07:57.713 --> 01:08:01.188
Why? Why? You hear that, Ray?

01:08:01.308 --> 01:08:03.706
I think she wants
a motive.

01:08:03.826 --> 01:08:05.663
- Did Scream have a plot?
- No.

01:08:05.743 --> 01:08:09.059
[Chuckles] 
Did I Know What You Did Last Summer
make any sense?

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.776
Don't think so!

01:08:11.856 --> 01:08:14.573
What about the sequel?
What was with that fat,
white Jamaican kid?

01:08:14.692 --> 01:08:17.609
- I wanna kill that motherfucker.
- It was bad casting, Bobby.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:20.126
How about this for a motive?
Lack of sex!

01:08:20.246 --> 01:08:23.243
It can cause serious
deviant behavior.

01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:26.759
- I thought you loved me.
- Oh, I did, baby.

01:08:26.877 --> 01:08:30.634
I did. But abstinence can make you
discover new things about yourself.

01:08:30.752 --> 01:08:33.151
That's right, Cindy. I'm gay.

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:35.868
And in case you haven't noticed,
so is Ray.

01:08:37.466 --> 01:08:39.662
What? I ain't gay.

01:08:39.743 --> 01:08:42.899
- What are you talking about?
You took me to that club.
- So, they play good music.

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:47.095
- What about our trip
to San Francisco, then?
- I wanted to go shopping.

01:08:48.773 --> 01:08:52.209
- But you made love to me.
- No. First of all, you sucked my--

01:08:52.288 --> 01:08:54.725
Whatever, Ray!
I don't want to talk about this now.

01:08:54.845 --> 01:08:58.482
The point is, I'm a new man,
and I'm ready to leave all this
behind and start a new life.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.557
- So you killed all your friends?
- Oh, no.

01:09:02.676 --> 01:09:04.474
Just you.

01:09:04.594 --> 01:09:06.752
And maybe Shorty,
but that wasnâ€™t planned or anything.

01:09:06.872 --> 01:09:09.149
But here's the genius part.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:12.465
We're copycatting a serial killer
that already exists.

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:16.180
- Its the perfect crime, Cindy.
- But wait! There's more!

01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:21.375
Hang on to your seat, baby,
cause this oneâ€™s a screamer!

01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:24.611
- I'll be back.
- Uh-oh.

01:09:24.731 --> 01:09:27.008
Move your big ass.
Come on.

01:09:27.127 --> 01:09:29.326
- Dad!
- [Grunts] 

01:09:29.404 --> 01:09:31.962
What are you gonna do,
frame him?

01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:36.118
Nah. We're just havin' a little bit
of fun with old daddio.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.274
The police are gonna find
you and daddy both dead,

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:42.908
and me and Ray are the only survivors
of maniacs revenge.

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:45.827
- You ready? I'm ready.
- You ready? I'm ready to do this shit.

01:09:45.946 --> 01:09:48.303
- Come on. Come on. All right.
- All right.

01:09:48.383 --> 01:09:50.621
- Come on! [Shouts] 
- Give it to me. No!

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

- Come on. Come on.
- Ready.

01:09:57.453 --> 01:09:58.931
Give it to me!

01:09:59.051 --> 01:10:00.809
No! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

01:10:00.889 --> 01:10:02.686
- Remember what we talked about?
To the side.
- I know.

01:10:02.806 --> 01:10:04.604
- How many times
we gonna go over this?
- Okay.

01:10:04.724 --> 01:10:06.602
Stop. Just--
All right. Trust me, okay?

01:10:06.682 --> 01:10:09.239
- All right. I'm ready.
- Trust me. I got this shit. Ready?

01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:12.155
- Wait, wait, wait!
- I'm about to cut your throat, boy!

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:14.273
Stop acting like a little girl.
Come on. Come on!

No! You guys are psychos!

01:10:20.626 --> 01:10:22.743
You've seen
one too many TV shows!

01:10:22.863 --> 01:10:26.938
No! Watching television shows
doesn't create psycho killers!

01:10:27.058 --> 01:10:29.296
Cancelin' TV shows does!

01:10:29.415 --> 01:10:31.613
The Wayans Brothers
was a good show, man!

01:10:31.692 --> 01:10:36.048
It was a good-ass show,
and we didn't even get a final episode!

01:10:36.168 --> 01:10:39.205
Take it easy!
I'm feelin' a little woozy here!

01:10:39.284 --> 01:10:41.961

- Are you okay?

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:41.821
I thought I told you
not to have a party unless I was here.

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:44.298
But, Dad, you were here.
You were in the closet.

01:12:44.377 --> 01:12:47.734
Oh, yeah, that's right. Did you get some
girlfriends numbers for me?

01:12:47.853 --> 01:12:50.771
- Dad, they're dead.
- Ah, you know, I cant get a break.

I'm a plumber, okay?

01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:02.517

- He was right here! I swear it!
- Who was?

01:13:20.935 --> 01:13:24.171
The killer!
The guy that murdered all my friends!

01:13:24.251 --> 01:13:27.807
And the sick bastard planted drugs
all in the house there.

01:13:27.887 --> 01:13:30.684
- All over the place.
- Dad. Stop it.

01:13:30.804 --> 01:13:33.440
All right, Cindy.
I'm gonna have to take you
down to the station.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.478
I'm cool, though, right?

01:13:35.598 --> 01:13:37.475

Okay. Lets go over this again.

01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:03.046
- You say it was an accident.
- Yes.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:06.162
- He was on the road.
- And you think he came back
to get revenge?

01:14:06.282 --> 01:14:08.999
- It has to be him, Sheriff.
- [Banging] 

01:14:14.353 --> 01:14:16.350
Here, Sheriff.
They wanted me to give this to you.

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:19.347
- Thatâ€™ll be all, Doofy.
- Okay.

01:14:19.467 --> 01:14:21.784
- I'm gonna go, then. All right.
- All right.

01:14:22.942 --> 01:14:24.741
Bye, Cindy.

01:14:27.816 --> 01:14:30.094
Iâ€™m sorry, Cindy.
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

01:14:30.214 --> 01:14:33.491
His name was David Keegan.
Some fishermen found his body
a few weeks later.

01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:36.886
- He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
- That's impossible.

01:14:39.164 --> 01:14:41.441
- Then I don't know who it could be.
- He's gotta be someone else...

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:44.798
who was connected with all the victims,
someone who knew about the accident.

01:14:44.917 --> 01:14:47.434
Someone who could move around
without being noticed.

01:14:49.672 --> 01:14:52.667
Oh, my God.

01:14:52.747 --> 01:14:56.424
She used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.
He had the biggest crush on her.

01:14:56.543 --> 01:14:59.301
[Gasping] Its me, Cindy.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.898
Night, Cindy.

01:15:04.654 --> 01:15:06.651
- Doofy!
- Shit head?

01:15:09.808 --> 01:15:11.646
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No.

01:15:11.725 --> 01:15:13.843
- Have you seen Doofy?
Has anybody seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

01:15:13.924 --> 01:15:16.320
- No.
- [Man] Yeah.
Just went out the back, Sheriff.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.558
[Sheriff] Doofy!

01:15:31.102 --> 01:15:34.339
He walks alone
under the big city lights

01:15:34.459 --> 01:15:38.016
He always knows
just when the time is right

01:15:38.135 --> 01:15:41.371
He never shows what he's thinking
He keeps it inside

01:15:41.491 --> 01:15:45.047
Because he's
too cool for school

01:15:45.126 --> 01:15:48.483
He comes alive
when the sun goes down

01:15:48.602 --> 01:15:51.919
He gets it right
You know he's always down

01:15:52.039 --> 01:15:55.354
He's got one eye open
and his ear to the ground

01:15:55.474 --> 01:15:58.311
And he's too cool for school

01:16:00.029 --> 01:16:03.345
He's an operator
He's a real player

01:16:37.785 --> 01:16:41.980
But either way it goes,
I'm gonna tell you all the rules
to survive this situation.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.096
Rule number one:
You gotta be quick.

01:16:45.176 --> 01:16:48.373
Rule number two:
Don't fall down.

01:16:48.453 --> 01:16:53.287
And rule number three:
Whatever you do, never look back.

01:16:53.367 --> 01:16:55.485
You all wish me luck.

01:16:55.604 --> 01:16:57.482
Snatch and run, you all!

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.356
Come back here, you motherfuckers!
Son of a bitch!

01:17:03.305 --> 01:17:09.165
