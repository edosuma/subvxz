WEBVTT

00:00.718 --> 00:02.779
Will Chase... FBI!

00:05.609 --> 00:07.689
Frankie Trowbridge... CIA.

00:07.692 --> 00:11.193
The world is in chaos,
so we've assembled

00:11.196 --> 00:13.529
all of America's best
intelligence assets

00:13.532 --> 00:14.598
under one banner.

00:14.601 --> 00:16.184
We are all officially working together.

00:16.187 --> 00:17.239
As a team.

00:17.242 --> 00:19.168
- Led by me.
- Led by me.

00:19.171 --> 00:20.981
Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier"...

00:20.984 --> 00:22.287
Frankie, you got to
start trusting people.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.581
You think now is a good time
for me to start working on that?

00:24.583 --> 00:27.411
I'm assigning you someone
to lay out your missions,

00:27.414 --> 00:29.590
service support wherever
you are in the world.

00:29.592 --> 00:30.624
Knock, knock.

00:30.626 --> 00:33.594
I'm so excited to be part of this team.

00:33.596 --> 00:35.363
Ooh-kay. Too soon?

00:35.365 --> 00:37.565
Four years at MIT,
three years at the NSA,

00:37.567 --> 00:40.501
and I have been reduced to
"Lock the door, Standish."

00:40.503 --> 00:42.170
We gotta grab Stavros... alive.

00:43.206 --> 00:45.273
You're too emotionally
available for a spy.

00:45.275 --> 00:47.344
Get him to open the vault, and
we can get our hands on the ledger

00:47.346 --> 00:48.876
and put a lot of bad people behind bars.

00:48.878 --> 00:50.777
You were right. I opened
up my big, dumb heart.

00:50.779 --> 00:53.246
It may have impacted the mission.

00:53.248 --> 00:54.548
May have?!

00:57.831 --> 00:59.731
Can we agree this is his fault?

00:59.734 --> 01:01.299
Hey!

01:01.302 --> 01:02.484
Did you cut my brakes?

01:02.487 --> 01:04.524
What you did to Will is unforgivable.

01:04.525 --> 01:06.025
You'll never be a part of this team.

01:06.027 --> 01:07.227
I could've died!

01:07.230 --> 01:09.454
Chance I was willing to take, Ray.

01:14.948 --> 01:16.734
_

01:20.638 --> 01:23.542
We have the Prime Minister and his wife.

01:23.545 --> 01:26.446
If the names on the list
are not released by noon,

01:26.448 --> 01:28.715
we will execute them both.

01:28.717 --> 01:30.717
Okay, he just set a noon deadline.

01:30.719 --> 01:33.234
Standish, where are you
on finding their location?

01:33.237 --> 01:35.187
I triangulated the signal from the call.

01:35.189 --> 01:36.722
I'm outside the building now.

01:36.724 --> 01:37.823
Sending the address.

01:37.825 --> 01:39.562
That's on the other side of London.

01:39.565 --> 01:40.906
It's almost noon.

01:40.909 --> 01:43.229
There's not enough time for
Will and Frankie to drive there.

01:43.231 --> 01:44.463
No problem!

01:44.465 --> 01:46.198
We had a different idea!

01:48.369 --> 01:49.901
Why do you get to drive?

01:49.903 --> 01:51.337
Because I got in first.

01:51.339 --> 01:52.838
That's not a good system.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.508
Well, at the dock, I
said, "Ladies first."

01:55.510 --> 01:57.943
You said, "I guess that
means I'm after you"...

01:57.945 --> 01:59.478
Very funny, by the way...

01:59.480 --> 02:01.647
So now you don't get to drive.

02:01.649 --> 02:03.048
Totally worth it.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.762 --> 02:17.995
Open the door.

02:17.997 --> 02:19.601
No habla ingles.

02:19.604 --> 02:21.566
IAbre la Puerta!

02:21.568 --> 02:23.434
I don't speak Spanish, either.

02:23.436 --> 02:25.537
Guys, we may have a problem.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.540
They've got Standish.

02:28.542 --> 02:32.177
My psych profile says they
won't hesitate to kill hostages.

02:43.390 --> 02:45.853
Drop your guns, or your friend dies.

02:45.856 --> 02:47.489
It's okay. We're not that tight.

02:47.492 --> 02:49.060
What are you doing?

02:49.062 --> 02:50.695
My job.

02:50.697 --> 02:52.997
You're gonna shoot Standish.

02:52.999 --> 02:54.331
If I have to.

02:56.435 --> 02:58.035
I can't let you do that.

02:58.037 --> 03:01.004
So, I can't talk to Standish
because they took his comms.

03:01.007 --> 03:02.273
Could someone please mention

03:02.276 --> 03:03.942
that wedding ring I just issued him?

03:03.945 --> 03:05.943
Standish, just know
that whatever happens,

03:05.945 --> 03:07.945
I'll make sure to notify your wife.

03:07.947 --> 03:09.546
Wife?

03:11.751 --> 03:13.550
Oh.

03:17.117 --> 03:18.255
Yeah!

03:18.257 --> 03:19.824
That's right, bitch!

03:27.666 --> 03:29.033
Come on, guys.

03:36.641 --> 03:38.174
They're dead.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.743
Again.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.846
Hello, agents.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.070
Don't feel bad.

03:44.073 --> 03:45.448
Remember, these training missions

03:45.450 --> 03:46.992
are designed to be impossible.

03:46.995 --> 03:49.162
Your team's getting better each time.

03:49.165 --> 03:51.332
Brilliant idea grabbing
the boat, by the way.

03:51.335 --> 03:54.190
Oh, thank you, sir. That was my idea.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.192
We would've made it
if you'd let me drive.

04:22.245 --> 04:26.622
_

04:29.370 --> 04:31.894
You've been pissed off for
three time zones. What's up?

04:31.896 --> 04:33.262
We would have made it in time

04:33.264 --> 04:34.897
if you let me shoot Standish.

04:34.899 --> 04:35.931
Excuse me?

04:35.933 --> 04:37.099
It's the job.

04:37.101 --> 04:39.268
Sometimes innocent people have to die.

04:39.270 --> 04:42.037
Or... This might be crazy...

04:42.039 --> 04:43.817
How about no innocent people die?

04:43.820 --> 04:45.286
I'm just... I'm spitballing here.

04:45.289 --> 04:47.000
Mr. Sensitivity gets all misty

04:47.003 --> 04:48.716
when we have to shoot one
of his friends in the face.

04:48.718 --> 04:50.829
You were gonna kill me. We've got beef.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.418
You're not capable of beef.

04:52.421 --> 04:53.668
I can do beef.

04:53.671 --> 04:55.150
Are you seriously criticizing me

04:55.152 --> 04:57.215
for caring about the
well-being of my team?

04:57.218 --> 04:58.353
Our team.

04:58.355 --> 05:00.188
Our team. Yes. Thank you.

05:00.190 --> 05:01.356
See? You're investing.

05:01.358 --> 05:02.824
If we want this thing to work,

05:02.826 --> 05:04.726
we've got to start treating
each other like we're a family.

05:04.728 --> 05:05.893
Hard pass.

05:05.895 --> 05:07.464
When you get emotionally invested,

05:07.468 --> 05:08.830
you can't make the tough decisions,

05:08.832 --> 05:10.878
which is why I don't
trust you to have my back.

05:10.881 --> 05:12.309
When you got shot in France,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.118
who performed emergency surgery on you?

05:14.121 --> 05:15.387
I literally saved your life.

05:15.390 --> 05:17.271
And you don't stop talking about it.

05:20.043 --> 05:21.376
Hey. Hey.

05:21.378 --> 05:23.211
She is just trying to push your buttons.

05:23.213 --> 05:25.372
Well it's not working.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.315
Attaboy.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.263
But how can she not trust me?

05:30.266 --> 05:31.364
Everybody trusts me.

05:31.367 --> 05:32.484
I'm an Eagle Scout.

05:32.487 --> 05:34.025
Sweetie, I know you're
super proud of that,

05:34.027 --> 05:35.793
but it's not as sexy as you think it is.

05:35.796 --> 05:37.490
Oh. It's pretty sexy.

05:37.493 --> 05:39.693
Director Casey wants to
talk to the two of us.

05:39.695 --> 05:41.262
Alright. You guys wait here.

05:41.264 --> 05:42.963
We'll fill you in.

05:42.965 --> 05:44.298
Can't wait.

05:45.168 --> 05:47.598
Or we can listen in on
everything they're saying.

05:47.601 --> 05:49.070
Hey-oh! Let me in.

05:49.072 --> 05:50.737
You bugged them?

05:50.739 --> 05:52.637
That is an invasion of their privacy.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.341
You want earbuds or not?

05:56.398 --> 05:57.611
Not.

05:57.613 --> 06:01.482
Agents, welcome back.

06:01.484 --> 06:03.317
How were the training exercises?

06:03.319 --> 06:04.651
Great, sir. We got better every time.

06:04.653 --> 06:06.253
He is lying. They went horribly.

06:06.255 --> 06:07.642
But she jokes a lot.

06:07.644 --> 06:08.809
- I don't.
- No, you do.

06:08.812 --> 06:10.991
We just have to work on your timing

06:10.993 --> 06:12.159
and delivery

06:12.161 --> 06:13.727
and level of appropriateness.

06:13.729 --> 06:15.463
Have a seat.

06:15.465 --> 06:19.004
So, agents, let's talk about
the future of your team.

06:19.007 --> 06:21.301
Oh, Director Casey is saying Jai and I

06:21.303 --> 06:24.312
are like a... diverse Batman and Robin.

06:24.315 --> 06:25.581
You're Robin.

06:27.408 --> 06:29.208
Oh, now he's talking about you.

06:29.211 --> 06:30.677
- Uh-oh.
- Hmm?

06:30.679 --> 06:31.845
Uh-oh.

06:31.847 --> 06:32.846
Fine.

06:32.848 --> 06:34.047
There it is.

06:34.049 --> 06:35.482
This better be good.

06:37.853 --> 06:39.352
Home, sweet home.

06:41.171 --> 06:42.923
So, we should probably...

06:42.925 --> 06:44.324
...debrief you on the Casey meeting.

06:44.326 --> 06:45.626
Basically, he told us that...

06:45.628 --> 06:47.476
Because of how our first mission went,

06:47.479 --> 06:49.146
he's not sure if he's
keeping the team together.

06:49.148 --> 06:50.614
Wait, how did you know that?

06:50.617 --> 06:51.798
Jai bugged you.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.166
You should probably get used to that.

06:53.168 --> 06:54.554
Yeah. We heard everything.

06:54.557 --> 06:56.135
Susan.

06:56.138 --> 06:58.887
Well, I'd expect this
from them, but you?

06:58.890 --> 07:00.507
Well, I said no at first,

07:00.509 --> 07:02.574
but, uh, then I got excited, so...

07:02.576 --> 07:04.143
Look, I don't get it.

07:04.145 --> 07:05.544
Why would they disband the team?

07:05.546 --> 07:07.481
Our first mission
wasn't that bad, was it?

07:07.484 --> 07:08.948
No. I mean, we killed our target,

07:08.950 --> 07:10.082
flooded a bank,

07:10.084 --> 07:11.476
and Will made kissy-face

07:11.479 --> 07:13.318
with the leader of an
international crime organization.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.739
I didn't make kissy-face.

07:14.742 --> 07:16.122
I mean, you did a little bit.

07:16.124 --> 07:17.356
So, what do we do now?

07:17.358 --> 07:19.058
We treat it like a normal workday.

07:19.060 --> 07:21.326
I mean, look, if this old bar
is gonna be our permanent home,

07:21.328 --> 07:23.036
I say we clean it up a bit, huh?

07:23.039 --> 07:24.363
Ooh. Sounds fun.

07:24.365 --> 07:25.851
I'm not sure you know what fun is.

07:25.859 --> 07:27.499
I know it's not cleaning.

07:30.037 --> 07:31.904
You guys think that's fun, right?

07:33.875 --> 07:36.876
Oh, yeah. This is my office.

07:36.878 --> 07:38.810
Well, hope they don't break up the team,

07:38.812 --> 07:42.714
'cause this definitely
beats my cubicle at the NSA.

07:42.716 --> 07:44.483
Thank you for that, by the way.

07:44.485 --> 07:45.679
Hey, don't mention it.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.682
Will, I want you to know,
I'm-a do you proud, man.

07:47.685 --> 07:49.019
Good. Good.

07:49.022 --> 07:50.421
And I want you to know
I'm gonna have you doing

07:50.423 --> 07:51.789
mostly tech work to start.

07:51.791 --> 07:52.690
Oh.

07:52.692 --> 07:54.993
It's cool, but eventually,

07:54.995 --> 07:57.187
you'll want me out there in the field.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.797
Can't leave the big dog
tied up on the porch, right?

07:59.799 --> 08:01.565
"Big dog on the porch." Sure, yeah.

08:01.567 --> 08:03.167
Um, Standish, you...

08:04.504 --> 08:06.309
You've never had any weapons training.

08:06.312 --> 08:08.132
- No.
- Show me how you hold a gun.

08:08.135 --> 08:09.825
You know what, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that...

08:09.827 --> 08:12.327
- Okay.
- ...uh, because I think it would be great...

08:12.330 --> 08:14.130
if I had...

08:14.133 --> 08:15.545
two.

08:15.548 --> 08:16.796
- Oh!
- Give myself a signature.

08:16.799 --> 08:18.516
- Sure.
- You know, something to know myself by.

08:18.518 --> 08:20.834
Pow-pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

08:20.837 --> 08:22.435
- Then we get low with it. Pow, pow!
- Oh.

08:22.437 --> 08:25.189
You know, reload.
Clap, click-click. Pow!

08:25.191 --> 08:26.528
- Whoa!
- Pow-pow-pow!

08:26.531 --> 08:27.752
- There's a guy behind you.
- I heard him.

08:27.754 --> 08:28.786
- You see that?
- Sure.

08:28.789 --> 08:29.728
Always listening.

08:29.731 --> 08:30.997
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.328
Here's the thing, Standish.

08:32.331 --> 08:34.331
Uh, the business we're in is real.

08:34.332 --> 08:35.631
The bullets are real.

08:35.634 --> 08:37.400
It's not... It's not a video game.

08:37.403 --> 08:39.046
You get shot...

08:39.049 --> 08:40.470
you die.

08:40.472 --> 08:42.605
- You got it?
- Yeah.

08:42.607 --> 08:44.674
Yeah, no, I mean, I got it.

08:44.676 --> 08:46.243
No, you don't.

08:46.245 --> 08:47.844
But you will.

08:47.846 --> 08:50.314
Look, I think you have the
potential to be a great agent,

08:50.316 --> 08:51.809
and I'm gonna help you get there.

08:51.812 --> 08:53.750
I promise. You just...

08:53.752 --> 08:55.752
You got to be patient.

08:55.754 --> 08:57.955
And... And for future reference,

08:57.957 --> 09:00.657
when you go to shoot someone,

09:00.659 --> 09:03.827
you want to make sure
that you actually see them.

09:03.829 --> 09:05.829
Right.

09:05.831 --> 09:08.226
Will, Standish, Ray's here.

09:10.436 --> 09:11.703
Oh, okay. Great.

09:11.706 --> 09:13.981
Now that we're all here, I
have a mission for you guys.

09:13.984 --> 09:15.271
If you pull it off, you're golden,

09:15.273 --> 09:18.174
and if you don't, well, they're
going to disband the team,

09:18.176 --> 09:19.708
and I get fired.

09:19.710 --> 09:22.211
Oh. Sounds like a lose-win situation.

09:23.781 --> 09:25.448
Maybe I'll just get
right to the mission.

09:25.450 --> 09:26.606
Ooh, wait for it.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.918
Ooh! Hey.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.887
Will said treat today
like a normal workday,

09:31.889 --> 09:33.655
so I upped our security system

09:33.657 --> 09:36.089
and shielded us against
any electronic surveillance.

09:36.092 --> 09:37.692
Wow. That's... That's great, Jai.

09:37.695 --> 09:38.794
Kiss-ass.

09:38.796 --> 09:40.156
Okay, well, your target

09:40.159 --> 09:42.856
is an Italian neofascist
group, Fascia Rossa.

09:42.859 --> 09:45.133
And due to the Italian
immigration crisis,

09:45.135 --> 09:48.537
right-wing hate groups have been
popping up all over the place.

09:48.539 --> 09:50.138
But Fascia Rossa is different.

09:50.140 --> 09:51.926
Because they're backed by a billionaire,

09:51.929 --> 09:54.409
they can cause havoc on a massive scale.

09:54.411 --> 09:56.207
And Fascia Rossa has proven adept

09:56.210 --> 09:59.247
at using social media
propaganda to grow in size.

09:59.249 --> 10:01.149
And I'm guessing they
convinced their followers

10:01.151 --> 10:03.519
that immigrants are the cause
of all problems plaguing Italy.

10:03.521 --> 10:06.145
Exactly. And now their
leader, Luca Crudele,

10:06.148 --> 10:08.188
wants to take Fascia
Rossa to the next level.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.625
We have Intel that an American engineer,

10:10.627 --> 10:12.426
Thomas Andrews,

10:12.428 --> 10:13.828
has been recruited to the group.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.363
Andrews' specialty is chemical bombs.

10:16.365 --> 10:20.100
They are paying him to make
a weapon of mass destruction.

10:22.104 --> 10:24.505
Your mission is to extract Andrews

10:24.507 --> 10:26.020
before he begins building a bomb

10:26.023 --> 10:28.308
and to get him to turn on Fascia Rossa.

10:28.310 --> 10:30.077
And the most important part...

10:32.448 --> 10:34.882
...to save my job.

10:38.132 --> 10:39.499
Let's go.

10:39.502 --> 10:41.083
Get out of my way.

10:41.085 --> 10:43.024
Ooh, she make you nervous, Ray?

10:43.026 --> 10:44.724
Well, she tried to kill me last week,

10:44.726 --> 10:46.390
so yeah, she makes me a little...

10:46.393 --> 10:48.459
What happened? You getting rusty?

10:49.961 --> 10:51.427
Let's go.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.574
_

11:08.384 --> 11:10.217
Ooh. Remember this?

11:10.219 --> 11:11.585
Old Faithful.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.554
Ooh. I really like your gun.

11:13.556 --> 11:15.155
Thank you. Jai picked it out.

11:15.157 --> 11:16.557
He has great taste.

11:16.559 --> 11:17.856
Sweet.

11:17.858 --> 11:18.924
Okay.

11:18.926 --> 11:21.427
- Now, these are badass!
- Yeah.

11:21.429 --> 11:22.562
Think I'm-a take this one.

11:22.564 --> 11:24.297
- Nice, right?
- Yeah.

11:24.299 --> 11:25.364
No.

11:25.367 --> 11:27.165
- None of these are for you.
- Why not?

11:27.168 --> 11:28.595
Well, I can't give a gun to someone

11:28.598 --> 11:29.834
who has no field experience.

11:29.837 --> 11:31.304
Plus, you act like a child.

11:31.306 --> 11:32.429
No offense.

11:32.432 --> 11:33.765
You know, you can't just insult me,

11:33.767 --> 11:35.373
then buy it back by saying "No offense."

11:35.376 --> 11:38.043
I can if I don't care whether
you were offended or not.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.207
No offense.

11:40.179 --> 11:42.315
Okay, guys. Let's take a look.

11:43.284 --> 11:45.700
This is our best chance
of grabbing Andrews.

11:45.703 --> 11:47.953
Luca Crudele is throwing a
party at his villa tonight

11:47.955 --> 11:49.021
for his supporters.

11:49.023 --> 11:50.234
Which is gonna be full

11:50.237 --> 11:52.590
of those ultra-violent
focaccia ravioli dudes.

11:52.593 --> 11:53.591
Fascia Rossa.

11:53.593 --> 11:54.570
My Italian's evolving.

11:54.573 --> 11:56.161
The point is, I need a gun.

11:56.163 --> 11:57.796
Don't worry. They're not
even gonna know we're there.

11:57.798 --> 12:00.364
Yeah, we locate Andrews,
drug him, extract him. Done.

12:00.367 --> 12:01.800
I don't necessarily
think we need to drug him.

12:01.802 --> 12:03.168
I'm pretty sure I can
get him to cooperate.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.567
Oh, once I'm done with
him, he'll "cooperate."

12:05.570 --> 12:07.439
I've never been so afraid of air quotes

12:07.441 --> 12:08.679
in my entire life.

12:08.682 --> 12:09.908
Of course you're
afraid to kick some ass.

12:09.910 --> 12:11.143
You're a total Boy Scout.

12:11.145 --> 12:12.610
What is your beef with the Boy Scouts?

12:12.612 --> 12:13.879
You two need to get on the same page,

12:13.881 --> 12:15.348
or someone's gonna get shot.

12:15.351 --> 12:17.309
- Probably Standish.
- Why me?

12:17.312 --> 12:18.884
I'm just throwing a name out there.

12:18.886 --> 12:21.453
Alright, guys. Let's
get ready to do this.

12:21.455 --> 12:24.089
Hey, Frankie. Hold up.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.515
You know, I think Susan's right.

12:25.518 --> 12:27.051
For the sake of the team, you and I...

12:27.054 --> 12:28.093
We're gonna need to connect.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.748
Please don't start talking family again.

12:29.751 --> 12:31.729
You know what the greatest
thing is about family?

12:31.732 --> 12:34.165
Seriously, I'm holding a gun.

12:34.167 --> 12:36.767
Right. Family always
has your back, okay,

12:36.770 --> 12:38.770
and I know you said that
you don't do attachments,

12:38.772 --> 12:41.439
but I got bad news for you, partner.

12:41.441 --> 12:43.234
I am going to win you over.

12:43.237 --> 12:45.651
My charm is like a virus.
It is. It's a charm virus.

12:45.654 --> 12:47.388
And before you know it,
boom, you're infected.

12:47.390 --> 12:49.323
So you're gonna give me a virus?

12:50.100 --> 12:52.734
Yes. Yes, I am. Metaphorically. Right?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.754
Look, my larger point

12:55.756 --> 12:58.423
is that you and I are
going to be attached

12:58.425 --> 12:59.858
because team...

12:59.860 --> 13:01.058
is like a family.

13:01.060 --> 13:02.707
- Look at that. I circled back.
- Stop.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.061
Let me make something clear.

13:04.063 --> 13:06.504
I don't mix the personal
with the professional,

13:06.507 --> 13:09.390
so I'm never going to let
myself care about any of you.

13:16.820 --> 13:19.201
Yeah, but what if it's true?
What if she never comes around?

13:19.203 --> 13:20.976
- Ah, don't be like that.
- No, I know.

13:20.978 --> 13:22.411
I just feel...

13:22.413 --> 13:24.780
Wow. You clean up nice.

13:24.782 --> 13:25.815
Thank you.

13:25.817 --> 13:28.050
You are...

13:28.052 --> 13:29.356
a bit of a mess.

13:29.359 --> 13:31.059
Please. In this tux, I'm like a 9.

13:31.062 --> 13:32.554
Worst case, 8 1/2,

13:32.556 --> 13:34.313
- but that's just because it's Italy.
- Yeah.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.991
I can always tell when you're nervous.

13:35.993 --> 13:37.351
You never get the tie right.

13:37.354 --> 13:38.860
I felt like Frankie and
I were making progress,

13:38.862 --> 13:41.796
and now she's just...
put her armor back on.

13:41.798 --> 13:43.331
Well, what did you expect?

13:43.333 --> 13:45.692
Did you think you were just
gonna say the word "family"

13:45.695 --> 13:47.468
and she'd go in for the group hug?

13:47.470 --> 13:49.865
Have I not explained the concept
of the charm virus to you?

13:49.868 --> 13:51.301
It's very simple.

13:51.304 --> 13:53.441
Just give her some time.

13:54.978 --> 13:56.377
No, you're right.

13:56.379 --> 13:58.098
She's probably trying
as hard as she can.

13:58.101 --> 13:59.814
I'm not even gonna bother trying.

13:59.816 --> 14:01.316
He's just pushing your buttons.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.684
Well, it's not working.

14:03.686 --> 14:06.220
And we're not family.
I don't even like him.

14:06.222 --> 14:08.256
Well, you didn't like
me when we first met.

14:08.258 --> 14:09.924
In fact, you tried to kill me.

14:09.926 --> 14:12.226
Yeah, but that was for
work. It wasn't personal.

14:12.228 --> 14:14.162
Do I sound like I'm judging?

14:16.581 --> 14:17.731
Mmm.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.300
My point is, we chose to get past that,

14:20.302 --> 14:22.636
and now... here we are.

14:22.638 --> 14:23.938
Besties.

14:23.940 --> 14:26.340
And I still resent the
fact that I care about you.

14:26.343 --> 14:27.653
Not that I do.

14:27.656 --> 14:28.709
Of course you don't.

14:28.711 --> 14:30.444
Alright, this...

14:30.446 --> 14:31.779
ties this together.

14:34.717 --> 14:36.411
You know, I could have killed you.

14:36.414 --> 14:37.651
I chose not to.

14:37.653 --> 14:38.953
Yeah.

14:38.955 --> 14:40.521
Hey, Francesca.

14:40.524 --> 14:41.823
Hmm?

14:43.224 --> 14:46.325
Whatever you decide...

14:46.328 --> 14:48.462
I got your back.

15:15.491 --> 15:17.551
Oh, you guys look so great.

15:17.554 --> 15:19.615
I know you're probably
wondering how it is in the van.

15:19.617 --> 15:20.760
Let me update you.

15:20.762 --> 15:22.161
Super sexy in here.

15:22.163 --> 15:23.696
This catering outfit, uh,

15:23.698 --> 15:26.298
really does wonders for my shape.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.266
No FOMO on this side.

15:28.268 --> 15:30.218
Just happy to be on a mission...

15:30.221 --> 15:31.569
in a van...

15:31.571 --> 15:33.605
once again.

15:42.549 --> 15:44.482
- Thank you.
- Anyone got eyes on Andrews?

15:44.484 --> 15:46.451
Nothing yet.

15:46.453 --> 15:48.086
Hey, on your six.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.590
Now, that is a partnership.

15:52.592 --> 15:54.793
I mean, they gotta be
married, what, 40 years?

15:54.795 --> 15:57.062
How do you think they make it work?

15:57.064 --> 15:59.529
They accept each other for who they are.

16:00.399 --> 16:01.598
Two old racists.

16:03.936 --> 16:05.202
Alright, shall we?

16:05.204 --> 16:07.004
Eh.

16:07.006 --> 16:09.439
It'll be easier to case the room.

16:14.179 --> 16:16.813
See? Better vantage point.

16:16.815 --> 16:17.981
Hmm.

16:20.252 --> 16:22.752
So, were you funny as a kid?

16:22.754 --> 16:25.606
My dad always said humor was
my best defense mechanism.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.125
He obviously never saw you shoot people.

16:32.097 --> 16:33.596
You two were close, huh?

16:34.432 --> 16:35.665
What are you doing?

16:35.667 --> 16:37.733
Just trying to get to know you.

16:39.023 --> 16:40.403
Never gonna stop trying.

16:40.405 --> 16:42.104
Yeah, well, we should stay on task.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.575
Susan, you got anything?

16:46.577 --> 16:48.010
Aside from half the men here

16:48.012 --> 16:50.279
pretending not to know their mistresses,

16:50.281 --> 16:51.714
all is clear.

16:51.716 --> 16:53.449
No sign of Andrews.

16:53.451 --> 16:55.217
Jai, are the cameras live?

16:55.219 --> 16:57.386
And the last one is...

16:57.388 --> 16:58.570
hot.

16:58.573 --> 17:00.489
Standish, you can run
facial recognition.

17:06.330 --> 17:07.730
Yeah, no, I've got eyes on everybody

17:07.732 --> 17:09.665
from out here at the kids table.

17:12.470 --> 17:14.378
Aprite!

17:14.382 --> 17:15.936
Aprite Ora!

17:15.939 --> 17:16.971
Uh, one second!

17:16.973 --> 17:19.272
Andiamo.

17:19.275 --> 17:21.443
Ah, geez.

17:21.444 --> 17:23.712
Catering things are happening right now.

17:24.819 --> 17:25.938
Hey.

17:25.941 --> 17:27.073
Cosa stai facendo?

17:27.076 --> 17:28.642
- What now?
- Cosa?

17:31.187 --> 17:33.688
You know what? I actually
don't speak Italian.

17:33.691 --> 17:35.821
I'm American. Tim. I'm from Tulane.

17:35.824 --> 17:37.345
Junior year. Studying abroad.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.526
I'm actually not even
supposed to be here.

17:38.528 --> 17:39.919
I just did this to pick
up a little extra cash,

17:39.921 --> 17:40.996
trying to get to Amsterdam,

17:40.998 --> 17:42.900
for the same reasons I
see that you are here.

17:42.903 --> 17:44.036
It's okay.

17:44.039 --> 17:45.266
I also partake a little bit,

17:45.268 --> 17:46.519
but if you're anything like me,

17:46.522 --> 17:48.169
you're probably starving
right now, right?

17:48.171 --> 17:49.471
I got something for you.

17:49.473 --> 17:50.905
Look at this.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.173
A whole tray of hors d'oeuvres.

17:53.176 --> 17:55.219
Yeah. I understand. I've
had the munchies before.

17:55.222 --> 17:56.610
- Shh!
- Yeah. Oh, shh.

17:56.612 --> 17:57.762
We'll keep it real quiet.

17:57.765 --> 17:59.179
Your little group
wouldn't appreciate it.

17:59.181 --> 18:00.144
You guys are weird.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.582
Have a good night. Alright, now.

18:02.585 --> 18:04.084
You guys, I just took out a guard

18:04.087 --> 18:05.352
with a tray of hors d'oeuvres.

18:05.355 --> 18:06.620
I'm gonna need a gun.

18:07.829 --> 18:09.095
Jai, he's got a point.

18:09.098 --> 18:12.508
First, you bug Will,
now no gun for Standish.

18:12.511 --> 18:14.928
Are you really that
much of a control freak?

18:15.998 --> 18:18.164
Oh. Oh.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.733
You are.

18:19.735 --> 18:21.101
Alright, fine.

18:21.103 --> 18:22.970
There is a weapon under the front seat.

18:22.972 --> 18:24.745
Do not make me regret this.

18:28.844 --> 18:30.543
Oh, hell yes.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.651
Jai?

18:38.653 --> 18:40.319
Where's the rest of it?

18:42.757 --> 18:44.417
You're so sweet.

18:44.420 --> 18:45.725
I am.

18:45.727 --> 18:48.393
This diminishes me as a man.

18:48.395 --> 18:52.464
Luca Crudele!

19:00.808 --> 19:02.508
Luca's gone onstage.

19:10.162 --> 19:11.358
_

19:12.745 --> 19:14.995
_

19:15.656 --> 19:18.390
Classic malignant narcissist.

19:18.392 --> 19:22.469
Same basic profile for
all sociopathic demagogues.

19:22.472 --> 19:27.144
_

19:29.703 --> 19:31.102
Target spotted.

19:34.408 --> 19:36.374
Why's he got a babysitter?

19:36.376 --> 19:38.276
You get Andrews.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.510
I'll get the handler.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.179
Yep.

19:41.190 --> 19:45.097
_

19:50.623 --> 19:51.855
Hey.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.457
We're leaving.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.625
Quietly.

19:58.324 --> 20:01.324
_

20:03.135 --> 20:04.669
Hi, handsome security guard.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.738
Do you know where the bathroom is?

20:07.740 --> 20:09.773
- Francesca?!
- Marco?

20:09.775 --> 20:11.808
I haven't seen you since Belgium.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.512
You look good.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.183
I didn't know you were political.

20:18.245 --> 20:19.382
It pays the bills.

20:20.452 --> 20:21.751
Wait.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.152
Are you here on business?

20:28.727 --> 20:31.294
Pig.

20:31.296 --> 20:34.531
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

20:36.602 --> 20:39.001
Hey. Wait.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.104
Ah. Ah.

20:41.106 --> 20:42.639
Did you just drug him?

20:42.641 --> 20:44.107
Yes, it's better this way. Trust me.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.742
We can't risk him sounding the alarm,

20:45.744 --> 20:47.618
- and we have to get out of here now.
- He was cooperating.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.378
Well, he's definitely cooperating now.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.647
Jai, you've got to stop giving
people weaponized jewelry.

20:51.649 --> 20:53.382
I'm serious.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.463
_

20:57.464 --> 20:59.583
_

20:59.586 --> 21:01.189
Working on an exit plan.

21:01.192 --> 21:02.925
One blackout coming right up.

21:12.542 --> 21:14.805
No, you're right!
This is so much easier!

21:14.808 --> 21:15.956
Are you even helping?

21:15.959 --> 21:17.606
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Jai! Damn it.

21:21.611 --> 21:22.744
Frankie!

21:22.746 --> 21:25.080
- You know him?!
- Go! Go! Go!

21:34.947 --> 21:37.835
- How do you know him?
- Before I joined the CIA,

21:37.838 --> 21:40.187
we did... jobs together.

21:40.190 --> 21:43.210
Like walking dogs, mowing
lawns, that kind of stuff?

21:43.213 --> 21:44.669
Yeah, it was a crazy summer.

21:44.672 --> 21:46.304
You were an assassin?

21:46.307 --> 21:48.023
Way to make it sound dirty.

21:48.026 --> 21:49.943
Anything else I should know about you?

21:49.946 --> 21:51.312
How much time you got?

21:53.453 --> 21:55.286
He's waking up.

21:55.288 --> 21:57.323
Oh, oh. Where am I?

21:57.326 --> 21:58.391
Who are you people?

21:58.394 --> 21:59.593
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

21:59.596 --> 22:01.092
I'm Special Agent Will Chase.

22:01.094 --> 22:02.827
You have two choices.

22:02.829 --> 22:05.463
We can charge you with terrorism
and conspiracy to commit murder,

22:05.465 --> 22:07.198
or you can roll on your employer

22:07.200 --> 22:08.866
and we can talk plea deal.

22:08.868 --> 22:10.368
I'm not telling you anything.

22:11.704 --> 22:13.171
Okay.

22:14.474 --> 22:15.640
My turn.

22:15.642 --> 22:18.342
I don't even know who you people are!

22:18.344 --> 22:20.776
But we don't have to do this.

22:21.980 --> 22:23.681
Look, you don't know the whole story.

22:23.683 --> 22:24.949
We're gonna find out.

22:28.287 --> 22:30.955
It really undermines my
ability to motivate the asset

22:30.957 --> 22:32.671
when you take the bullets out of my gun.

22:32.674 --> 22:34.291
Well, it pays to think ahead.

22:36.575 --> 22:39.595
Andrews, we know you've started
building a bomb for them.

22:39.597 --> 22:40.897
Where were you working?

22:40.899 --> 22:42.866
I'll tell you everything,

22:42.868 --> 22:45.001
but I have certain conditions.

22:45.003 --> 22:46.330
Wrong answer.

22:46.333 --> 22:47.436
Ohh!

22:47.438 --> 22:48.944
Frankie, you're gonna break him.

22:48.947 --> 22:50.054
I don't care.

22:51.777 --> 22:53.910
I-I did it for my daughter.

22:53.912 --> 22:57.047
Okay?

22:57.049 --> 22:58.514
Th... They forced me.

22:58.516 --> 23:01.284
They said if I didn't build
a bomb, they would kill her.

23:01.286 --> 23:03.219
I don't believe him. Jai?

23:04.736 --> 23:07.470
Oh, thank you. I
wouldn't lie to you, okay?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.874
My daughter means
everything to me. Look. Look.

23:09.877 --> 23:11.860
See? Here she is.

23:11.862 --> 23:13.095
She's 10 years old.

23:16.466 --> 23:17.499
See?

23:17.501 --> 23:18.934
Susan.

23:18.936 --> 23:20.635
He's holding your gaze,

23:20.637 --> 23:22.504
his pupils are dilated.

23:22.506 --> 23:24.639
I believe him.

23:24.641 --> 23:26.208
Me, too.

23:26.210 --> 23:27.876
Seems really credible.

23:30.246 --> 23:33.748
But it's not my area,
so I'll just shut up.

23:33.751 --> 23:36.862
Listen, I-I-I'll tell you
whatever you need to know, okay?

23:36.865 --> 23:39.366
I just have to make sure
that my daughter is safe.

23:39.369 --> 23:41.335
They'll take her, and I need your help.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.499
We don't negotiate.

23:42.502 --> 23:44.292
Think what you want about me,

23:44.294 --> 23:46.894
but Isabella... She's innocent.

23:54.570 --> 23:57.905
Don't tell me that you're
seriously considering this.

23:57.907 --> 23:59.306
I'll tell you what.

23:59.308 --> 24:01.943
If he's lying, I'll shoot him myself.

24:11.130 --> 24:12.162
Hey.

24:12.288 --> 24:13.855
Hey.

24:13.857 --> 24:15.241
Got you a coffee.

24:15.244 --> 24:17.058
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

24:17.060 --> 24:18.992
Did you get any sleep?

24:18.994 --> 24:20.160
No.

24:20.162 --> 24:21.828
No, I mean, we're so divided.

24:21.830 --> 24:23.063
Honestly...

24:23.065 --> 24:24.562
I wouldn't mind Frankie hating me,

24:24.565 --> 24:26.833
as long as it brought the team together.

24:26.835 --> 24:28.135
Nah.

24:28.137 --> 24:29.977
You can't stand anyone not liking you.

24:29.980 --> 24:32.069
Well, that's just because
it doesn't make any sense.

24:32.072 --> 24:33.540
I am... I am very likable.

24:33.542 --> 24:34.875
Will.

24:34.877 --> 24:37.578
Frankie doesn't hate you.

24:37.580 --> 24:39.380
Stop it. I...

24:39.382 --> 24:40.791
Hey. Oh, um...

24:40.794 --> 24:42.188
When we're out there with Andrews,

24:42.189 --> 24:44.133
do me a favor and keep
an eye on Standish.

24:44.135 --> 24:45.719
There.

24:45.721 --> 24:47.454
That right there.

24:47.456 --> 24:48.741
What?

24:48.744 --> 24:50.577
That's why this team is gonna be okay.

24:50.580 --> 24:52.992
You always put everybody first.

24:52.995 --> 24:56.155
It's like your... It's like
your number-one superpower.

24:56.158 --> 24:58.498
Mnh. I don't know. What
about my boyish good looks?

24:58.500 --> 24:59.632
Hmm.

24:59.635 --> 25:00.633
No.

25:00.635 --> 25:02.478
No? W-Wait. I'm gonna
gaze out this window.

25:02.481 --> 25:03.905
Look how handsome I look.

25:03.908 --> 25:07.106
Ohh, yeaaah, I do see it.

25:07.108 --> 25:08.140
Uh-huh.

25:08.142 --> 25:09.241
You're an idiot.

25:09.243 --> 25:10.510
Wh... Come on.

25:11.679 --> 25:13.776
That's hard to hear, but I understand.

25:15.283 --> 25:17.850
Alright. We got to roll. Okay.

25:17.852 --> 25:19.652
You gonna do some more gazing?

25:19.654 --> 25:21.320
Find some more windows.

25:22.457 --> 25:24.457
We'll get your daughter
into protective custody.

25:24.459 --> 25:28.393
Then you give us everything
we need on the bomb.

25:28.395 --> 25:30.796
Alright, team, eyes
up. We're on the move.

25:30.798 --> 25:33.171
Once again letting your
emotions get in the way.

25:33.174 --> 25:36.334
Did my emotions get in the way
when I saved your life in France?

25:36.337 --> 25:38.455
You're prohibited from
saying it ever again.

25:38.458 --> 25:39.858
Saved it. Did it.

25:41.642 --> 25:43.107
So, this is dope,

25:43.109 --> 25:46.221
walking around, all
strapped and whatnot.

25:46.224 --> 25:48.090
What exactly are we
supposed to be doing?

25:48.093 --> 25:50.448
Scan the crowd without being obvious.

25:50.451 --> 25:52.583
You're looking for hostiles.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.377
Uh-huh.

25:54.380 --> 25:55.747
Okay.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.989
So, you had no field
training at the NSA.

25:57.992 --> 26:00.417
They just put you in front of
a computer and left you there?

26:00.420 --> 26:03.582
Yeah. But I play a lot of
"Fortnite," so I should be okay.

26:03.585 --> 26:05.219
I'm gonna pretend like
I didn't hear that,

26:05.221 --> 26:07.046
because it's so embarrassing for you.

26:08.101 --> 26:09.527
Jai, any activity?

26:09.530 --> 26:11.647
All clear on my scanner. Will?

26:11.650 --> 26:12.887
Alright. We're almost at the rendezvous.

26:12.889 --> 26:14.069
No sign of the girl yet.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.706
- I appreciate you doing this.
- Yeah.

26:15.709 --> 26:17.075
We're not doing this for you.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.761
We're doing this to stop Fascia Rosa

26:18.764 --> 26:21.581
from killing innocent people
with a bomb you designed.

26:21.584 --> 26:23.248
I didn't think I had a choice.

26:23.251 --> 26:24.698
You always have a choice.

26:29.522 --> 26:31.478
Alright. Here comes the kid.

26:31.481 --> 26:32.514
Southeast corner.

26:32.517 --> 26:34.350
Headed for the tram stop.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.896
There she is.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.530
No, no, no. Stay with
us. You understand?

26:40.532 --> 26:42.532
We'll get to her as soon
as we know it's safe.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.101
Susan? Standish?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.136
Still clear. No hostiles in sight.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.404
Okay.

26:52.578 --> 26:53.847
Isabella!

27:12.396 --> 27:14.363
No!

27:16.735 --> 27:18.134
Isabella!

27:18.136 --> 27:19.235
No. No!

27:19.237 --> 27:20.737
Shoot.

27:20.739 --> 27:23.139
Hey! Isabella! Move! Move!

27:25.009 --> 27:28.377
Hey! Hey! Wait! Wait!

27:29.880 --> 27:31.413
Wait! Aah!

27:31.415 --> 27:33.716
Hey! Isabella!

27:46.196 --> 27:47.829
I got him!

28:06.083 --> 28:07.315
Oh!

28:29.539 --> 28:31.532
- Ooh! You Al...
- J-J-J-J-J-Jai, Jai, I'm so sorry.

28:31.534 --> 28:32.800
Shush!

28:32.803 --> 28:35.222
You consider yourself
officially disarmed.

28:35.225 --> 28:36.543
Come on!

28:36.545 --> 28:38.417
Anderson, hey, it's gonna be okay.

28:38.420 --> 28:39.814
It's gonna be o...
We'll find your daughter.

28:39.816 --> 28:41.182
I lied... I lied to you.

28:41.184 --> 28:42.649
The bomb...

28:43.452 --> 28:45.233
It's done. I finished it.

28:45.236 --> 28:46.268
What?

28:46.271 --> 28:48.554
Fascia Rossa's gonna use it today.

28:48.557 --> 28:50.522
What? Andrews, hey, stay with me.

28:50.525 --> 28:52.558
Hey, Andrews, Andrews,
tell me where the bomb is.

28:52.561 --> 28:54.161
Andrews. Andrews, listen to me.

28:54.163 --> 28:55.595
Tell me where the bomb is.

28:55.597 --> 28:57.631
Hey, Andrews. Damn it. Come on!

28:57.633 --> 28:59.834
Will, Marco got away.

28:59.836 --> 29:02.569
Jai tagged him. We need to go... now!

29:11.508 --> 29:13.341
Look, in my defense,

29:13.343 --> 29:15.423
there were a lot of people
around, and he was a moving target!

29:15.425 --> 29:17.258
- It was...
- Still angry.

29:18.230 --> 29:20.163
Alright, Marco's about
a mile ahead of us.

29:20.165 --> 29:22.372
He's almost out of my tracker's
range, but it's holding.

29:22.375 --> 29:23.900
Why are we following this guy?

29:23.902 --> 29:25.302
Because he's our only lead!

29:25.304 --> 29:26.571
What about the girl?

29:26.574 --> 29:28.971
Don't worry. We're gonna save
her after we deal with the bomb.

29:28.973 --> 29:30.086
Yes, we are.

29:30.089 --> 29:31.541
We made a promise to the man.

29:31.543 --> 29:33.376
Hey, Andrews was not
gonna help us otherwise.

29:33.378 --> 29:34.688
I could've gotten it out of him.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.979
Oh, by torturing a man who's
trying to protect his child?

29:36.981 --> 29:39.048
That is always a no on this team!

29:39.050 --> 29:40.316
Are we clear?!

29:42.087 --> 29:44.653
Ugh! Why did I waste a second of my time

29:44.655 --> 29:45.855
trying to bond with you?!

29:45.857 --> 29:47.223
You have not been honest with me

29:47.225 --> 29:49.297
since the moment we
started working together!

29:49.300 --> 29:50.121
Guys!

29:50.124 --> 29:51.491
We don't even know who
the hell she really is!

29:51.493 --> 29:53.059
- You want to know who I am?!
- Tell me!

29:53.062 --> 29:54.777
I'm a killer! And now I'm your partner!

29:54.780 --> 29:56.213
Enjoy!

29:59.258 --> 30:01.591
This is a disaster.
Yeah, what do you expect?

30:01.594 --> 30:02.827
It's an arranged marriage.

30:02.830 --> 30:04.461
I'll talk to Will. You talk to her.

30:04.464 --> 30:06.097
Look, there's nothing I can do, alright?

30:06.100 --> 30:07.750
You're wrong. She will listen to you.

30:07.753 --> 30:09.120
No, she won't.

30:09.123 --> 30:10.485
Your obsessive need to control

30:10.488 --> 30:11.955
means that you won't attempt anything

30:11.957 --> 30:13.191
if you can't predict the outcome.

30:13.193 --> 30:14.424
God, would you stop!

30:15.688 --> 30:17.219
Stop touching me. Stop fixing me.

30:17.221 --> 30:19.087
Stop digging around in here.

30:19.089 --> 30:21.457
Your opinion means nothing to me.

30:25.375 --> 30:27.041
Okay.

30:28.332 --> 30:30.599
Uh, guys, the, uh, tracker stopped.

30:30.601 --> 30:32.568
There's a small piazza up ahead.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.577
How about a warning next time?

30:41.579 --> 30:43.379
Okay. We're here.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.888
It's a Saints' Day festival.

30:53.890 --> 30:55.456
The whole city turns out.

30:57.993 --> 30:59.422
This must be where the bomb is.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.558
Yeah. Blow up a huge crowd,
blame it on immigrants,

31:01.561 --> 31:03.129
watch the country burn.

31:03.132 --> 31:04.391
Well done, Luca.

31:04.394 --> 31:05.493
You stay on comms.

31:05.496 --> 31:07.183
- We'll locate Marco.
- Alright, let's go.

31:07.186 --> 31:08.602
I'm gonna stay in the van,

31:08.605 --> 31:10.338
figure out how to disable this bomb...

31:10.340 --> 31:12.607
You know, if you find it.

31:13.929 --> 31:16.176
I'm gonna stay back, too,
if that's okay with you.

31:16.179 --> 31:17.278
I think I know how to help.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.012
Get in the van. Come on.

31:26.955 --> 31:28.288
You got anything?

31:28.290 --> 31:29.989
No.

31:29.991 --> 31:31.091
You?

31:31.093 --> 31:32.735
Nope. I got nothing.

31:32.738 --> 31:34.771
Scusi.

31:34.774 --> 31:36.165
Check down there.

31:38.334 --> 31:41.335
Scusi. Scusi. Scusi.

31:44.806 --> 31:46.305
Look, man, I'm really sorry

31:46.307 --> 31:47.440
about the whole "shooting you" thing.

31:47.442 --> 31:49.108
Mnh-mnh. Now's not the time.

31:51.145 --> 31:52.845
Come on.

31:52.847 --> 31:54.447
Hey, isn't that Marco's bike?

31:54.449 --> 31:55.481
Yes.

31:55.484 --> 31:58.285
Okay, so, I retasked an NSA satellite.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.187
Alright, we found Marco's
bike, but, uh, no Marco.

32:04.925 --> 32:06.392
According to the heat signature,

32:06.394 --> 32:09.328
it says that you're standing
at the location of the bomb.

32:10.109 --> 32:12.243
There's nothing here.

32:15.637 --> 32:17.169
What if we're right on top of it?

32:17.171 --> 32:18.535
It's worth a shot.

32:18.538 --> 32:19.672
Give me a hand.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.978
Ohh.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.447
Alright.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.048
I guess I'm on point for this one, huh?

32:31.050 --> 32:34.218
I want to say "Ladies
first" so bad right now.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.053
I respect that.

32:40.093 --> 32:42.360
Alright. You're getting closer.

32:42.362 --> 32:44.028
Do you see anything?

32:44.030 --> 32:46.097
Nothing yet, but
there's a light up ahead.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.740
Jai, I think we found it.

32:55.742 --> 32:58.040
Okay, see if you can
find me any related files

32:58.043 --> 33:00.679
- from Andrews' personal server.
- Already on it.

33:00.681 --> 33:01.745
Good man.

33:11.433 --> 33:12.989
Hey, Frankie.

33:19.966 --> 33:21.765
Agh.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.301
I gotta say,

33:23.303 --> 33:25.269
the new guy's a bit of a downgrade.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.438
Is this what you do now?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.941
Take out women and
children for a payday?

33:29.943 --> 33:31.309
You're one to talk.

33:31.311 --> 33:33.211
Or did CIA erase your memory

33:33.213 --> 33:34.912
when they made you their bitch?

33:34.914 --> 33:36.147
Such a tough guy.

33:36.149 --> 33:37.715
But at the party, I put you down,

33:37.717 --> 33:39.283
and you stayed down.

33:39.285 --> 33:42.785
A real man would only be
out for, what, 20 seconds?

33:42.787 --> 33:44.020
Right, Will?

34:29.693 --> 34:32.092
I should have killed you in Belgium.

34:32.096 --> 34:33.728
Yeah, you should've.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.243
You have nice friends.

34:49.947 --> 34:52.130
Alright, one minute, 55 seconds, Jai.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.697
Okay. Calm down.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.366
Uh, we're pretty calm here, buddy.

34:55.368 --> 34:56.900
Talking to myself.

34:56.902 --> 34:58.425
Okay.

34:58.428 --> 35:01.305
To disable the bomb, you
need to remove the detonator.

35:01.307 --> 35:02.506
That's it?

35:02.508 --> 35:04.144
Yeah, except the containment wall

35:04.147 --> 35:06.844
underneath the reaction chamber
has electro-capacitive contacts

35:06.846 --> 35:08.679
that are surrounding
the detonation module.

35:08.681 --> 35:10.614
Can we get that in English, please, Jai?

35:10.616 --> 35:12.416
Okay, you know the game "Operation"?

35:12.418 --> 35:13.551
It's exactly like that,

35:13.553 --> 35:15.319
except if you touch the side...

35:15.321 --> 35:17.659
thousands of people die.

35:17.662 --> 35:19.657
Hey, Susan, I need
you to figure out a way

35:19.659 --> 35:21.091
to get rid of that crowd.

35:39.311 --> 35:41.544
Okay. I see the detonator.

35:44.917 --> 35:46.483
I can fit my hand in there,

35:46.485 --> 35:48.018
but then I can't see anything.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.820
Um... alright. Here.
Let me see if I can.

35:53.691 --> 35:55.524
Okay, I see your hand.

35:55.527 --> 35:56.800
Alright, get on.

35:56.803 --> 35:58.923
I'll be your eyes and talk
you through from down here.

35:58.925 --> 36:01.098
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.100
Okay. Keep going.

36:05.971 --> 36:08.104
Slightly to your right.

36:08.106 --> 36:11.852
And then slowly pull
down and towards you.

36:11.855 --> 36:14.878
If this whole thing goes sideways,

36:14.880 --> 36:17.480
I want you to know
that I think you're a...

36:17.482 --> 36:18.753
capable agent.

36:20.969 --> 36:23.250
And I know I'm not the
easiest person to work with.

36:23.253 --> 36:25.855
No, you're a cakewalk.

36:27.559 --> 36:29.926
Look, I made mistakes, too, alright,

36:29.928 --> 36:31.422
but we still have each other's backs.

36:31.425 --> 36:32.463
You know why?

36:32.466 --> 36:33.875
If you say "Because we're family,"

36:33.878 --> 36:35.665
I am gonna let this thing explode.

36:37.135 --> 36:38.635
We are a family.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.072
Careful.

36:43.074 --> 36:44.674
It's heavy.

36:44.676 --> 36:45.975
Do not touch the sides.

36:45.977 --> 36:47.576
Okay.

36:47.578 --> 36:49.845
Move your thumb a little to the left.

36:49.847 --> 36:52.109
No, no, no, no. Okay. Okay.
You got it. You're fine.

36:52.112 --> 36:54.016
Now put your hand a little right.

36:54.018 --> 36:56.218
There... and down.

36:56.220 --> 36:57.619
Okay.

36:57.621 --> 36:59.989
Okay. Keep going.

36:59.991 --> 37:02.158
And slowly pull your hand towards you.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.526
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes. You're right there.

37:06.264 --> 37:07.729
Okay. Now straight out.

37:13.137 --> 37:14.803
I got it. Okay.

37:28.018 --> 37:29.484
Green, by the way.

37:30.252 --> 37:31.792
What?

37:31.795 --> 37:33.923
Oh, come on. You were trying to
figure out what color my eyes are.

37:33.925 --> 37:35.129
I-I wasn't wondering...

37:35.131 --> 37:38.493
- ...what color your eyes are.
- Wait. Jai. Hey, why is this thing still humming?

37:38.495 --> 37:42.063
Oh, I'm betting that's 'cause
Andrews booby-trapped it.

37:43.033 --> 37:45.033
Run!

37:57.146 --> 37:58.555
I saved your life again.

38:01.517 --> 38:03.183
No, you didn't.

38:08.824 --> 38:10.790
It's over.

38:10.792 --> 38:12.426
We failed.

38:15.364 --> 38:17.597
No loose ends.

38:30.372 --> 38:31.805
Now it's over.

38:32.848 --> 38:34.105
I've got her.

38:34.108 --> 38:36.191
Yep. Hands behind your back.

38:38.820 --> 38:40.186
Isabella, hi.

38:40.188 --> 38:41.900
Look at me, sweetie.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.070
It's gonna be okay.

38:50.799 --> 38:53.399
I know what you're thinking, Whiskey,

38:53.401 --> 38:55.183
but everyone's got a soft spot.

38:59.006 --> 39:01.540
I mean, you've got hundreds of them.

39:01.543 --> 39:03.809
You say that like it's a bad thing.

39:06.295 --> 39:09.346
_

39:11.485 --> 39:12.952
What do you want, Ray?

39:12.954 --> 39:14.516
Nice work, guys.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.621
My job is safe.

39:15.623 --> 39:16.755
Yay.

39:16.757 --> 39:18.231
Oh, yeah. And, uh, good news...

39:18.234 --> 39:19.666
They're keeping the team together.

39:20.494 --> 39:22.227
Way to bury the lede, Ray.

39:22.230 --> 39:24.262
You know, it just got me to thinking.

39:24.264 --> 39:26.188
This team can get better and better

39:26.191 --> 39:27.765
the closer and closer
we all get as friends.

39:27.767 --> 39:29.214
Bye, Ray.

39:29.217 --> 39:30.703
Hello?

39:30.705 --> 39:31.937
Yeah, I got to go, too.

39:31.939 --> 39:34.139
I got... stuff to do. A big meeting.

39:34.141 --> 39:35.507
Had to hang up on them

39:35.509 --> 39:37.542
'cause of my big,
important meeting I have.

39:37.544 --> 39:39.544
You all stay working hard.

39:49.856 --> 39:53.225
"Doesn't play well with others."

39:53.227 --> 39:54.926
That is what my teacher wrote

39:54.928 --> 39:56.761
in my report card...

39:56.763 --> 39:58.163
in kindergarten.

39:58.165 --> 40:00.532
Mine wrote, "Susan
is a ray of sunshine."

40:02.136 --> 40:04.669
I don't feel like I have
anything to apologize for.

40:04.671 --> 40:05.870
Yes, you do.

40:05.872 --> 40:07.805
But just for the sake of argument,

40:07.807 --> 40:09.540
we're gonna say that I...

40:09.542 --> 40:11.442
happen to agree with you.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.948
Look...

40:19.026 --> 40:20.251
...I just...

40:20.253 --> 40:22.620
♪ You feelin' alright? ♪

40:22.622 --> 40:25.256
...I haven't quite
worked with many, um...

40:25.258 --> 40:27.692
♪ I'm not feelin' too good myself ♪

40:27.694 --> 40:30.361
...people... before.

40:30.363 --> 40:32.183
♪ You feelin' alright? ♪

40:32.186 --> 40:37.334
So this whole team thing
is... is new for me.

40:38.705 --> 40:40.337
But I'm trying.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.140
Look, Jai, I'm a big girl.

40:44.143 --> 40:46.043
You and I are good.

40:46.046 --> 40:48.613
But I'm not the one that you
need to square things with.

40:51.384 --> 40:53.150
And I think you know that.

40:56.489 --> 40:58.622
You know, you are a ray of sunshine!

40:58.624 --> 41:00.023
I know!

41:00.025 --> 41:03.173
Just a... burning, relentless...

41:03.176 --> 41:04.609
♪ You feelin' alright? ♪

41:04.612 --> 41:06.530
...ray of sunshine.

41:07.697 --> 41:10.433
Frankie! Get over here!

41:10.436 --> 41:13.604
We gotta celebrate a
successful mission together!

41:13.606 --> 41:15.806
♪ You feelin' alright? ♪

41:15.808 --> 41:18.140
Okay. I got you something.

41:18.866 --> 41:21.773
No way! Thank you, man!

41:21.776 --> 41:23.946
I... You know, I want you to
know how much this means to me,

41:23.948 --> 41:26.026
knowing that you have faith in me to...

41:26.029 --> 41:27.717
There's no bullets in this gun.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.652
No. Those come later.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.688
Much later.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.889
Hey, guys I'd like to propose a toast.

41:33.891 --> 41:35.558
I thought I would do the toast.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.950
I appreciate it.

41:36.953 --> 41:39.250
I already wrote some stuff
down, though... just some ideas.

41:39.252 --> 41:41.185
Oh, guess you were
that guy in high school.

41:41.188 --> 41:43.456
What's wrong with being
that guy in high school?

41:43.459 --> 41:45.426
- What?
- You said, "You were that guy in high school,"

41:45.428 --> 41:46.338
and it was an implication

41:46.340 --> 41:47.715
that there's something
wrong with being "that guy."

41:47.717 --> 41:49.741
Oh, no, nothing wrong
with being a total loser.

41:49.744 --> 41:51.175
- I'll give the toast.
- Okay.

41:51.178 --> 41:53.374
- You want to use my little ideas that...
- Thank you.

41:53.377 --> 41:55.744
- No?
- Here's to a successful mission.

41:55.746 --> 41:57.112
Y mucho más.

41:57.114 --> 41:58.313
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:58.315 --> 41:59.307
Salut.
