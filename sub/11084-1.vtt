02:14.000 --> 02:19.671
A fiddler on the roof.
Sounds crazy, no?

02:22.801 --> 02:26.957
But here, in our
little village of Anatevka,

02:27.061 --> 02:33.881
you might say every one of us
is a fiddler on the roof.

02:33.985 --> 02:40.510
Trying to scratch out
a pleasant, simple tune

02:40.614 --> 02:44.140
without breaking his neck.

02:44.244 --> 02:46.392
It isn't easy.

02:46.496 --> 02:53.528
You may ask why do we stay
up there if it's so dangerous?

02:53.633 --> 03:00.207
Well, we stay because
Anatevka is our home.

03:01.465 --> 03:04.495
And how do we keep our balance?

03:04.599 --> 03:08.249
That I can tell you in one word:

03:08.354 --> 03:09.805
Tradition.

03:13.143 --> 03:15.213
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

03:15.317 --> 03:17.185
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

03:18.190 --> 03:19.299
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

03:19.403 --> 03:21.763
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

03:21.867 --> 03:23.734
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

03:24.738 --> 03:26.695
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

03:39.836 --> 03:42.616
Because of our traditions,

03:42.720 --> 03:47.709
we've kept our balance
for many, many years.

03:52.557 --> 03:58.551
Here in Anatevka,
we have traditions for everything.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.098
How to sleep. How to eat.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.362
How to work.

04:08.406 --> 04:11.526
How to wear clothes.

04:12.786 --> 04:17.486
For instance,
we always keep our heads covered,

04:17.591 --> 04:21.444
and always wear a little prayer shawl.

04:21.548 --> 04:26.534
This shows our constant devotion to God.

04:26.638 --> 04:32.294
You may ask,
how did this tradition get started?

04:32.398 --> 04:35.169
I'll tell you.

04:35.273 --> 04:37.336
I don't know.

04:37.441 --> 04:39.966
But it's a tradition.

04:40.070 --> 04:44.097
And because of our traditions,

04:44.202 --> 04:47.971
every one of us knows who he is

04:48.075 --> 04:51.654
and what God expects him to do.

04:55.370 --> 04:58.445
<i>~ Who, day and night,</i>
<i>must scramble for a living ~</i>

04:58.549 --> 05:01.237
<i>~ Feed a wife and children,</i>
<i>say his daily prayers ~</i>

05:01.342 --> 05:04.326
<i>~ And who has the right</i>
<i>as master of the house ~</i>

05:04.430 --> 05:07.662
<i>~ To have the final word at home ~</i>

05:07.766 --> 05:10.038
<i>~ The papa ~</i>

05:10.142 --> 05:12.876
<i>~ The papa ~</i>

05:12.980 --> 05:14.002
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

05:14.107 --> 05:16.170
<i>~ The papa ~</i>

05:16.274 --> 05:18.963
<i>~ The papa ~</i>

05:19.068 --> 05:21.183
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

05:23.565 --> 05:26.512
<i>~ Who must know the way</i>
<i>to make a proper home ~</i>

05:26.616 --> 05:29.640
<i>~ A quiet home, a kosher home ~</i>

05:29.744 --> 05:32.601
<i>~ Who must raise a family</i>
<i>and run the home ~</i>

05:32.705 --> 05:35.700
<i>~ So Papa's free to read the Holy Book ~</i>

05:38.872 --> 05:41.236
<i>~ The mama ~</i>

05:41.340 --> 05:43.206
<i>~ The mama ~</i>

05:43.919 --> 05:44.956
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

05:45.060 --> 05:47.281
<i>~ The mama ~</i>

05:47.386 --> 05:49.911
<i>~ The mama ~</i>

05:50.015 --> 05:52.166
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

05:55.972 --> 05:59.086
<i>~ At three I started Hebrew school ~</i>

05:59.190 --> 06:02.009
<i>~ At ten I learned a trade ~</i>

06:02.113 --> 06:05.178
<i>~ I hear they picked a bride for me ~</i>

06:05.283 --> 06:08.181
<i>~ I hope she's pretty ~</i>

06:08.286 --> 06:14.149
<i>~ And who does Mama teach</i>
<i>to mend and tend and fix ~</i>

06:14.658 --> 06:20.940
<i>~ Preparing her to marry</i>
<i>whoever Papa picks ~</i>

06:21.044 --> 06:23.109
<i>~ The daughters ~</i>

06:23.213 --> 06:25.082
<i>~ The daughters ~</i>

06:26.044 --> 06:27.050
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

06:27.155 --> 06:28.827
<i>~ The papas</i>
<i>Mamas ~</i>

06:28.931 --> 06:32.163
<i>~ Sons</i>
<i>The daughters ~</i>

06:32.267 --> 06:34.132
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

06:38.640 --> 06:45.427
And in the circle of our little village,
we've always had our special types.

06:45.531 --> 06:50.433
For instance,
Yente, the matchmaker.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.231
Reb Nachum, the beggar.

06:56.158 --> 07:01.313
And, most important of all,
our beloved rabbi.

07:01.417 --> 07:03.733
Rabbi, may I ask you a question?

07:03.837 --> 07:05.530
Certainly, Leibesh.

07:05.635 --> 07:08.866
Is there a proper blessing for the Tzar?

07:08.970 --> 07:12.575
A blessing for the Tzar? Of course.

07:12.679 --> 07:16.082
May God bless and keep the Tzar...

07:16.186 --> 07:19.297
far away from us.

07:20.056 --> 07:21.421
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

07:21.526 --> 07:22.881
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

07:22.985 --> 07:26.090
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai</i>
<i>Dai dai dai dai dai ~</i>

07:26.194 --> 07:27.636
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

07:27.740 --> 07:29.263
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

07:29.367 --> 07:32.275
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai</i>
<i>Dai dai dai dai dai ~</i>

07:56.802 --> 08:00.415
Then there are
the others in our village.

08:00.519 --> 08:04.677
They make a much bigger circle.

08:07.813 --> 08:13.518
We don't bother them
and, so far, they don't bother us.

08:16.071 --> 08:21.943
And among ourselves,
we always get along perfectly well.

08:23.078 --> 08:27.195
Of course, there was the time
when he sold him a horse

08:27.300 --> 08:33.200
and told him it was only six years old
when it was really twelve.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.909
But now it's all over.

08:36.015 --> 08:41.215
And we all live
in simple peace and harmony.

08:44.265 --> 08:46.502
- It was really twelve years old.
- It was six.

08:46.607 --> 08:49.353
Tevye knows it was twelve.

08:55.443 --> 08:57.807
Twelve.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.024
It was twelve.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.817
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

09:09.922 --> 09:11.790
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

09:12.335 --> 09:13.573
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

09:13.677 --> 09:15.785

09:15.889 --> 09:17.754

09:20.141 --> 09:23.248
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai dai ~</i>

09:23.353 --> 09:25.220
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

09:26.266 --> 09:29.046
Traditions, traditions.

09:29.150 --> 09:31.464
Without our traditions,

09:31.568 --> 09:36.974
our lives would be as shaky as... as...

09:37.078 --> 09:40.852
As a fiddler on the roof.

13:24.421 --> 13:27.867
Mama, Yente the matchmaker is coming.

13:27.971 --> 13:30.996
Maybe she's finally found
a good match for you, Tzeitel.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.541
From your mouth to God's ears.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.879
Why is she here now?
It's almost Sabbath.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.506
Out, all of you.
I want to talk to Yente alone.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.971
But, Mama, the men she finds...
The last one was so old.

13:44.075 --> 13:47.150
And he was bald.
He had no hair.

13:47.819 --> 13:50.894
A poor girl without a dowry
can't be so particular.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.059
You want hair, marry a monkey.

13:53.163 --> 13:56.188
Even a poor girl
has to look at her husband sometimes.

13:56.292 --> 13:58.945
A husband is not to look at,
a husband is to get.

13:59.049 --> 14:02.363
- I'm not yet 20 years old. I don't think...
- Sha!

14:02.467 --> 14:05.118
Do you have to boast about your age?

14:05.222 --> 14:07.826
You wanna tempt the evil eye? Da, da, da.

14:07.930 --> 14:12.750
Out, all of you. There's work
to be done before the Sabbath.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.336
Golde. Golde.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.967
I have such news for you.

14:24.071 --> 14:30.557
And not every-day-in-the-week news.
Once-in-a-lifetime news.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.894
Such diamonds, such jewels.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.520
I'll find a husband for every one of them.

14:37.624 --> 14:42.070
But you shouldn't be so picky.
Right? Of course, right.

14:42.175 --> 14:48.907
After all, even the worst husband
is better than no husband. God forbid!

14:49.012 --> 14:51.075
Who should know better than me?

14:51.179 --> 14:53.872
Ever since my husband died,
I've been a poor widow.

14:53.976 --> 14:57.293
All alone, no one to talk to,
nothing to say to anyone.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.875
All I do at night is think of him.

14:59.979 --> 15:03.675
And even thinking of him
gives me no pleasure.

15:08.942 --> 15:12.056
- Is Tzeitel in the house?
- Why don't you go and find out?

15:12.160 --> 15:14.230
Thank you, Bielke.

15:19.911 --> 15:22.064
He never raised his voice.

15:22.169 --> 15:25.155
Good afternoon.
Is Tzeitel in the house?

15:25.259 --> 15:27.320
She's busy. Come back later.

15:27.424 --> 15:29.617
There's something I'd like to tell her.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.949
- Later.
- Later?

15:32.054 --> 15:33.922
Hm.

15:35.427 --> 15:38.207
What does that poor skinny tailor
want with Tzeitel?

15:38.311 --> 15:41.418
They've been friends since
they were babies. They play...

15:41.522 --> 15:46.089
- They play? What do they play?
- I don't know. They're children.

15:46.193 --> 15:48.929
From such children come other children.

15:49.033 --> 15:51.094
Motel is nothing.

15:51.198 --> 15:54.517
Yente, you said you had news for me.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.516
Ah, children, children...

15:56.620 --> 15:59.274
They are your blessing in your old age.

15:59.378 --> 16:03.568
But my Aaron, may he rest in peace,
couldn't give me children.

16:03.673 --> 16:07.071
To tell you the truth, he hardly tried.

16:07.175 --> 16:11.451
But what's the use complaining?
Other women enjoy complaining.

16:11.556 --> 16:13.616
Not Yente.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.290
Not every woman in the world is a Yente.

16:17.394 --> 16:22.918
Well, I have to go home now
to prepare my poor Sabbath meal.

16:23.022 --> 16:25.131
So, goodbye, Golde.

16:25.235 --> 16:29.050
And it was a pleasure
talking our hearts out to each other.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.511
You said you had news for me.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.806
I'm losing my head.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.266
Some day it will fall off altogether.

16:36.370 --> 16:40.480
And a horse will kick it in the mud
and "Goodbye, Yente".

16:40.585 --> 16:43.197
Of course, the news.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.831
It's about Lazar Wolf, the butcher.

16:46.935 --> 16:48.997
A good man. A fine man.

16:49.102 --> 16:53.297
And I don't have to tell you
he's well off, no?

16:53.402 --> 16:55.840
But he's lonely, the poor man.

16:55.944 --> 17:00.804
He's been a widower all these years.
You understand? Of course you do.

17:00.908 --> 17:08.021
To make it short, out of the whole town
he's cast his eye on Tzeitel.

17:08.125 --> 17:12.106
- My Tzeitel?
- No, the Tzar's Tzeitel.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.689
Of course your Tzeitel.

17:14.792 --> 17:18.703
Such a match for my Tzeitel.

17:19.752 --> 17:24.575
But Tevye wants a learned man.
He doesn't like Lazar.

17:24.679 --> 17:29.623
Lazar won't marry him.
He wants the daughter, not the father.

17:29.728 --> 17:31.790
Listen to me, Golde.

17:31.894 --> 17:35.668
You send Tevye to him.
Don't tell him what it's about.

17:35.772 --> 17:38.005
Let Lazar discuss it himself.

17:38.109 --> 17:42.637
He'll win him over,
he's a good man and a wealthy man.

17:42.742 --> 17:47.723
You'll let me know how it went.
And you don't have to thank me, Golde,

17:47.827 --> 17:51.601
because, aside from my fee,
which Lazar will pay anyway,

17:51.705 --> 17:56.024
it gives me satisfaction
to make people happy.

17:56.128 --> 17:59.319
True? Of course, true.

17:59.423 --> 18:03.573
So, goodbye, Golde,
and you're welcome.

18:03.677 --> 18:05.130
Goodbye, Yente.

18:07.049 --> 18:08.703
Come, children.

18:08.807 --> 18:11.998
Get changed for the Sabbath.
Hurry with your work.

18:12.102 --> 18:14.582
I wonder if Yente found a husband for you.

18:14.686 --> 18:17.545
I'm not anxious for her to find me one.

18:17.650 --> 18:20.635
- Unless it's Motel, the tailor.
- I didn't ask you.

18:20.739 --> 18:25.302
Tzeitel, they have to make a match for you
before they can make one for me.

18:25.406 --> 18:27.803
- Then after her, one for me.
- So if Yente...

18:27.908 --> 18:30.389
Yente, Yente, Yente!

18:30.494 --> 18:32.809
Somebody has to arrange the matches.

18:32.914 --> 18:35.567
- She may bring someone wonderful.
- Interesting.

18:35.672 --> 18:38.532
- And well off.
- And important.

18:40.788 --> 18:45.284
<i>~ Matchmaker, matchmaker,</i>
<i>make me a match ~</i>

18:45.389 --> 18:49.626
<i>~ Find me a find,</i>
<i>catch me a catch ~</i>

18:50.468 --> 18:54.958
<i>~ Matchmaker, matchmaker,</i>

18:55.062 --> 18:59.219

19:01.729 --> 19:05.847
<i>~ Matchmaker, matchmaker,</i>
<i>I'll bring the veil ~</i>

19:05.951 --> 19:10.848
<i>~ You bring the groom,</i>
<i>slender and pale ~</i>

19:10.952 --> 19:17.900
<i>~ Bring me a ring for I'm longing</i>
<i>to be the envy of all I see ~</i>

19:18.005 --> 19:21.153
<i>~ For Papa, make him a scholar ~</i>

19:21.257 --> 19:24.656
<i>~ For Mama, make him rich as a king ~</i>

19:24.760 --> 19:32.077
<i>~ For me, well, I wouldn't holler</i>
<i>if he were as handsome as anything ~</i>

19:32.181 --> 19:34.956
<i>~ Matchmaker, matchmaker,</i>
<i>make me a match ~</i>

19:35.060 --> 19:38.333
<i>~ Find me a find,</i>
<i>catch me a catch ~</i>

19:38.438 --> 19:41.340
<i>~ Night after night in the dark I'm alone ~</i>

19:41.445 --> 19:48.482
<i>~ So find me a match of my own ~</i>

19:49.527 --> 19:52.141
Since when are you
interested in a match, Chava?

19:52.245 --> 19:55.101
I thought you just had
your eye on your books.

19:55.205 --> 19:57.646
And you have your eye
on the rabbi's son.

19:57.751 --> 19:59.275
Why not?

19:59.379 --> 20:04.109
We only have one rabbi
and he only has one son.

20:04.213 --> 20:06.489
Why shouldn't I want the best?

20:06.593 --> 20:11.203
Because you're from a poor family,
so whatever Yente brings, you'll take.

20:11.307 --> 20:14.632
Right? Of course, right.

20:15.261 --> 20:18.374
<i>~ Hodel, oh, Hodel,</i>
<i>have I made a match for you ~</i>

20:18.479 --> 20:21.586

20:21.690 --> 20:23.964
<i>~ But he's a nice man, a good catch ~</i>

20:24.069 --> 20:25.299
<i>~ True? True ~</i>

20:25.403 --> 20:28.553
<i>~ I promise you'll be happy</i>
<i>and even if you're not ~</i>

20:28.658 --> 20:33.027
<i>~ There's more to life than that -</i>
<i>don't ask me what ~</i>

20:35.823 --> 20:38.937
<i>~ Chava, I found him,</i>
<i>will you be a lucky bride ~</i>

20:39.041 --> 20:42.192
<i>~ He's handsome, he's tall -</i>
<i>that is, from side to side ~</i>

20:42.296 --> 20:45.279
<i>~ But he's a nice man, a good catch, right? ~</i>

20:45.384 --> 20:46.344
<i>~ Right ~</i>

20:46.448 --> 20:49.488
<i>~ You heard he has a temper</i>
<i>He'll beat you every night ~</i>

20:49.592 --> 20:53.750
<i>~ But only when he's sober -</i>
<i>so you're all right ~</i>

20:54.300 --> 20:56.786
<i>~ Did you think you'd get a prince ~</i>

20:56.890 --> 20:59.803
<i>~ Well, I'll find the best I can ~</i>

21:00.389 --> 21:04.335
<i>~ With no dowry, no money ~</i>

21:04.439 --> 21:06.921
<i>~ No family background ~</i>

21:07.025 --> 21:11.434
<i>~ Be glad you've got a man ~</i>

21:17.156 --> 21:22.228
<i>~ Matchmaker, matchmaker,</i>
<i>you know that I'm still very young ~</i>

21:22.332 --> 21:24.730
<i>~ Please, take your time ~</i>

21:24.835 --> 21:28.693
<i>~ Up to this minute I misunderstood ~</i>

21:28.797 --> 21:32.572
<i>~ That I could get stuck for good ~</i>

21:32.676 --> 21:35.785
<i>~ Dear Yente, see that he's gentle ~</i>

21:35.889 --> 21:38.958
<i>~ Remember, you were also a bride ~</i>

21:39.062 --> 21:43.043
<i>~ It's not that I'm sentimental ~</i>

21:43.148 --> 21:47.258
<i>~ It's just that I'm terrified ~</i>

21:47.362 --> 21:50.345
<i>~ Matchmaker, matchmaker,</i>
<i>plan me no plans ~</i>

21:50.449 --> 21:53.680
<i>~ I'm in no rush,</i>
<i>maybe I've learned ~</i>

21:53.784 --> 21:58.393
<i>~ Playing with matches,</i>
<i>a girl can get burned ~</i>

21:58.497 --> 22:02.229
<i>~ So bring me no ring,</i>
<i>groom me no groom ~</i>

22:02.334 --> 22:05.817
<i>~ Find me no find,</i>
<i>catch me no catch ~</i>

22:05.922 --> 22:11.334
<i>~ Unless he's a matchless match ~</i>

22:29.700 --> 22:31.603
Dear God,

22:31.707 --> 22:34.703
was that necessary?

22:35.539 --> 22:40.362
Did you have to make him lame
just before the Sabbath?

22:40.466 --> 22:43.158
That wasn't nice.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.408
It's enough you pick on me.

22:45.512 --> 22:49.959
Bless me with five daughters,
a life of poverty, that's all right.

22:50.063 --> 22:52.675
But what have you got against my horse?

22:54.141 --> 23:00.218
Really, sometimes I think,
when things are too quiet up there,

23:00.322 --> 23:02.634
you say to yourself,

23:02.738 --> 23:08.237
"Let's see. What kind of mischief
can I play on my friend, Tevye?"

23:13.660 --> 23:16.774
Uh-huh. So you're finally here,
my breadwinner.

23:16.878 --> 23:18.858
I'll talk to you later.

23:18.963 --> 23:22.365
- Why are you late today?
- His foot went lame.

23:22.469 --> 23:26.995
Hurry up. The sun won't wait.
I have something important to say to you.

23:27.099 --> 23:29.160
I still have deliveries.

23:29.265 --> 23:32.334
- You'll be late for the Sabbath.
- I won't be late.

23:32.439 --> 23:37.668
- You'll be late.
- I won't be late. I won't be late.

23:37.772 --> 23:42.385
- If you ever stop talking, I won't be late.
- You can die from such a man.

23:42.489 --> 23:48.807
As the Good Book says "Heal us,
O Lord, and we shall be healed."

23:48.911 --> 23:52.018
In other words, send us the cure.

23:52.122 --> 23:54.737
We've got
the sickness already.

24:04.545 --> 24:08.662
Well, I'm not really complaining.

24:08.767 --> 24:11.877
After all, with your help...

24:13.554 --> 24:17.000
I'm starving to death.

24:17.104 --> 24:19.305
Oh, dear Lord.

24:23.647 --> 24:27.848
You made many, many poor people.

24:27.952 --> 24:32.311
I realise, of course,
it's no shame to be poor.

24:32.415 --> 24:35.822
But it's no great honour either.

24:40.664 --> 24:44.155
So what would have been so terrible

24:44.259 --> 24:48.878
if I had a small fortune.

24:53.135 --> 24:55.499
<i>~ If I were a rich man ~</i>

24:55.603 --> 25:00.380
<i>~ Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby</i>
<i>dibby dibby dum ~</i>

25:00.484 --> 25:03.967
<i>~ All day long, I'd biddy biddy bum ~</i>

25:04.071 --> 25:06.971
<i>~ If I were a wealthy man ~</i>

25:07.075 --> 25:10.057
<i>~ I wouldn't have to work hard ~</i>

25:10.161 --> 25:14.974
<i>~ Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby</i>
<i>dibby dibby dum ~</i>

25:15.079 --> 25:22.277
<i>~ If I were a biddy biddy rich</i>
<i>idle deedle daidle daidle man ~</i>

25:22.381 --> 25:26.862
<i>~ I'd build a big, tall house ~</i>

25:26.967 --> 25:32.244
<i>~ With rooms by the dozen</i>
<i>right in the middle of the town ~</i>

25:32.348 --> 25:38.456
<i>~ A fine, tin roof</i>
<i>with real wooden floors below ~</i>

25:38.561 --> 25:42.923
<i>~ There would be</i>
<i>one long staircase just going up ~</i>

25:43.028 --> 25:46.464
<i>~ And one even longer coming down ~</i>

25:46.569 --> 25:51.391
<i>~ And one more leading nowhere,</i>
<i>just for show ~</i>

25:54.029 --> 25:59.856
<i>~ I'd fill my yard</i>
<i>with chicks and turkeys and geese ~</i>

25:59.960 --> 26:03.692
<i>~ And ducks for the town to see and hear ~</i>

26:03.796 --> 26:09.572
<i>~ Squawking just as noisily as they can ~</i>

26:09.676 --> 26:14.409
<i>~ And each agay and ago</i>
<i>and aga and aca ~</i>

26:14.513 --> 26:17.416
<i>~ Will land like a trumpet on the ear ~</i>

26:17.520 --> 26:23.964
<i>~ As if to say, here lives a wealthy man ~</i>

26:30.399 --> 26:32.635
<i>~ If I were a rich man ~</i>

26:32.740 --> 26:37.268
<i>~ Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby</i>
<i>dibby dibby dum ~</i>

26:37.372 --> 26:41.021
<i>~ All day long, I'd biddy biddy bum ~</i>

26:41.125 --> 26:43.777
<i>~ If I were a wealthy man ~</i>

26:43.881 --> 26:47.068
<i>~ I wouldn't have to work hard ~</i>

26:47.172 --> 26:51.656
<i>~ Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby</i>
<i>dibby dibby dum ~</i>

26:51.760 --> 26:59.661
<i>~ If I were a biddy biddy rich</i>
<i>idle deedle daidle daidle man ~</i>

26:59.766 --> 27:04.795
<i>~ I'd see my wife, my Golde ~</i>

27:04.899 --> 27:09.881
<i>~ Looking like a rich man's wife</i>
<i>with a proper double chin ~</i>

27:09.985 --> 27:14.144
<i>~ Supervising meals to her heart's delight ~</i>

27:15.778 --> 27:20.517
<i>~ I'd see her putting on airs</i>
<i>and strutting like a peacock ~</i>

27:20.621 --> 27:24.062
<i>~ Oh, what a happy mood she's in ~</i>

27:24.166 --> 27:28.490
<i>~ Screaming at her servants</i>
<i>day and night ~</i>

27:32.711 --> 27:37.872
<i>~ The most important men in town</i>
<i>will come to fawn on me ~</i>

27:38.467 --> 27:46.169
<i>~ They will ask me to advise them</i>
<i>like a Solomon The Wise ~</i>

27:46.274 --> 27:49.507
<i>~ If you please, Reb Tevye ~</i>

27:49.611 --> 27:53.435
<i>~ Pardon me, Reb Tevye ~</i>

27:54.358 --> 27:59.935
<i>~ Posing problems</i>
<i>that would cross a rabbi's eyes ~</i>

28:00.040 --> 28:02.433
<i>~ Yah da-dee da da ~</i>

28:02.537 --> 28:04.353
<i>~ Yah da da da ~</i>

28:04.457 --> 28:06.771
<i>~ Yah da da da ~</i>

28:06.876 --> 28:09.705
<i>~ Da ~</i>

28:11.291 --> 28:18.284
<i>~ And it won't make one bit of difference</i>
<i>if I answer right or wrong ~</i>

28:18.500 --> 28:25.653
<i>~ When you're rich,</i>
<i>they think you really know ~</i>

28:25.757 --> 28:32.161
<i>~ If I were rich</i>
<i>I'd have that time that I lack ~</i>

28:32.265 --> 28:35.749
<i>~ To sit in the synagogue and pray ~</i>

28:35.853 --> 28:41.877
<i>~ And maybe have a seat</i>
<i>by the eastern wall ~</i>

28:41.981 --> 28:50.094
<i>~ And I'd discuss the Holy Books with</i>
<i>the learned men seven hours every day ~</i>

28:50.198 --> 28:57.689
<i>~ And that would be</i>
<i>the sweetest thing of all ~</i>

29:02.413 --> 29:04.693
<i>~ If I were a rich man ~</i>

29:04.797 --> 29:09.696
<i>~ Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby</i>
<i>dibby dibby dum ~</i>

29:09.800 --> 29:13.286
<i>~ All day long, I'd biddy biddy bum ~</i>

29:13.390 --> 29:15.868
<i>~ If I were a wealthy man ~</i>

29:15.972 --> 29:19.081
<i>~ I wouldn't have to work hard ~</i>

29:19.186 --> 29:23.880
<i>~ Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby</i>
<i>dibby dibby dum ~</i>

29:23.984 --> 29:27.089
<i>~ Lord, who made the lion and the lamb ~</i>

29:27.194 --> 29:30.467
<i>~ You decreed I should be what I am ~</i>

29:30.571 --> 29:35.691
<i>~ Would it spoil some vast eternal plan ~</i>

29:37.114 --> 29:46.700
<i>~ If I were a wealthy man ~</i>

30:01.096 --> 30:03.960
Tevye, where's your horse?

30:04.064 --> 30:07.881
It decided to take the day off.

30:07.986 --> 30:12.973
- Have a good Sabbath.
- Thank you, Your Honour. Thank you.

30:16.570 --> 30:21.991
- It's almost the Sabbath.
- You kept us all waiting.

30:22.451 --> 30:27.493
Look at this.
Look what it says in the paper.

30:29.124 --> 30:30.989
Quiet!

30:31.093 --> 30:36.579
Will you stop braying like mules?
Let the man talk. Talk, Avram.

30:36.683 --> 30:40.958
My paper came to the post office today,
like it does every week.

30:41.062 --> 30:43.539
Usually on a Thursday, but sometimes...

30:43.643 --> 30:47.923
Avram, that's not talking.
That's babbling.

30:48.028 --> 30:50.504
The news, what does it say?

30:50.608 --> 30:52.425
Quiet!

30:52.529 --> 30:53.844
Talk, Avram.

30:53.948 --> 30:56.427
I was reading my paper.

30:56.531 --> 31:01.349
Nothing important, a story about
the crops in the Ukraine, and this and that.

31:01.454 --> 31:04.782
Avram, talk.

31:05.911 --> 31:09.529
And then I saw this.

31:10.749 --> 31:14.699
All right. We all see it.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.797
What does it say?

31:21.177 --> 31:24.168
"In a village called Rajanka,

31:24.272 --> 31:29.258
all the Jews were evicted,
forced to leave their homes."

31:30.936 --> 31:33.634
For what reason?

31:33.738 --> 31:38.386
It doesn't say. Maybe the Tzar
wanted their land. Maybe a plague.

31:38.491 --> 31:42.098
- May he have his own personal plague.
Amen!

31:42.203 --> 31:45.727
Why don't you ever bring us
some good news?

31:45.831 --> 31:49.067
It's not my fault. I only read it.

31:49.171 --> 31:51.527
"An edict from the authorities."

31:51.631 --> 31:55.658
May the authorities grow like onions,
with their heads in the ground.

31:55.762 --> 31:57.029
Amen!

31:57.133 --> 32:00.786
What good will your cursing do?

32:00.890 --> 32:05.841
You stand around, you curse and
you chatter, and you don't do anything.

32:06.722 --> 32:10.252
- You'll all chatter your way into the grave.
- Excuse me.

32:10.356 --> 32:13.464
- You're not from this village.
- No.

32:13.568 --> 32:18.271
- Where are you from?
- Kiev. I was a student in the university.

32:21.028 --> 32:25.729
Tell me, is that the place where you
learned how not to respect your elders?

32:25.833 --> 32:29.232
That is where I learned
there is more to life than talk.

32:29.336 --> 32:33.362
You should know what's
going on in the outside world.

32:33.467 --> 32:36.116
Why break my head
about the outside world?

32:36.220 --> 32:40.539
Let the outside world
break its own head. Well put.

32:41.090 --> 32:44.664
He is right.
As the Good Book says,

32:44.768 --> 32:48.833
"If you spit in the air,
it lands in your face."

32:48.937 --> 32:50.834
Nonsense.

32:50.938 --> 32:56.171
You can't close your eyes
to what's happening in the world.

32:56.276 --> 32:59.347
- He is right.
- He's right and he's right?

32:59.451 --> 33:01.897
They can't both be right.

33:02.862 --> 33:04.931
You are also right.

33:05.036 --> 33:07.894
He's too young to wipe his own nose.

33:07.998 --> 33:10.946
Good Sabbath, Tevye.

33:12.955 --> 33:16.945
- Here. Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath, Tevye.

33:17.050 --> 33:21.788
- Tevye, Tevye?
- I'm sorry. I apologise.

33:22.882 --> 33:24.746
Good Sabbath.

33:24.850 --> 33:28.175
- Tevye, the rabbi's order.
- Of course.

33:29.430 --> 33:31.583
So you're from Kiev, Reb?

33:31.687 --> 33:34.296
- Perchik.
- Perchik.

33:34.400 --> 33:38.088
So you're a newcomer here, huh?

33:38.193 --> 33:43.971
As Abraham said,
"I'm a stranger in a strange land."

33:44.076 --> 33:46.139
Moses said that.

33:46.243 --> 33:47.892
Forgive me.

33:47.996 --> 33:52.562
As King David said,
"I'm slow of speech and slow of tongue."

33:52.667 --> 33:55.781
That was also Moses.

33:56.957 --> 34:00.872
For a man with a slow tongue,
he talked a lot.

34:02.796 --> 34:04.866
Here, Reb Perchik.

34:04.971 --> 34:07.163
Have a piece.

34:07.268 --> 34:09.873
I have no money, and I'm not a beggar.

34:09.978 --> 34:14.014
Take it.
It's a blessing for me to give.

34:15.893 --> 34:18.379
Very well.
For your sake.

34:18.483 --> 34:20.934
Thank you.

34:21.982 --> 34:24.429
It's no crime to be poor.

34:24.534 --> 34:28.434
It is the rich who are the criminals.
Some day, their wealth will be ours.

34:28.538 --> 34:33.813
That would be nice.
If they would agree, I would agree.

34:33.918 --> 34:36.819
And who will make
this miracle to come to pass?

34:36.922 --> 34:38.945
Ordinary people.

34:39.049 --> 34:42.033
- Like you?
- Like me.

34:42.137 --> 34:46.699
Until your golden day comes,
Reb Perchik, how will you live?

34:46.804 --> 34:49.956
By giving lessons to children.
Do you have children?

34:50.060 --> 34:52.128
I have five daughters.

34:53.013 --> 34:54.712
Five?

34:54.815 --> 34:56.710
Daughters.

34:56.813 --> 34:59.717
Girls should learn, too.
Girls are people.

34:59.821 --> 35:01.382
- A radical.
- Go away.

35:01.486 --> 35:05.970
I'd be willing to teach them,
open their minds to great thoughts.

35:06.074 --> 35:08.183
I'd like them to know the Good Book.

35:08.287 --> 35:11.519
The Bible has many lessons
for our times.

35:11.624 --> 35:14.101
Perchik,

35:14.205 --> 35:16.732
I'm a very poor man.

35:16.836 --> 35:20.902
But, food for lessons, huh?

35:21.006 --> 35:23.447
Good. Stay with us for the Sabbath.

35:23.551 --> 35:27.578
Of course, we don't eat like kings,
but we don't starve either.

35:27.682 --> 35:29.076
As the Good Book says,

35:29.181 --> 35:33.414
"When a poor man eats a chicken,
one of them is sick."

35:33.518 --> 35:36.587
- Where does the Book say that?
- All right, all right.

35:36.691 --> 35:42.049
It doesn't exactly say that,
but some place, it mentions a chicken.

35:42.153 --> 35:44.601
- Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.

35:48.277 --> 35:50.763
Good Sabbath, children.

35:50.867 --> 35:53.143
Children, this is Perchik.

35:53.248 --> 35:56.770
- Perchik, this is my eldest daughter.
- Good Sabbath.

35:56.874 --> 36:01.237
- You have a pleasant daughter.
- I have <i>five</i> pleasant daughters.

36:01.341 --> 36:04.611
This is mine.
And this is mine.

36:04.715 --> 36:07.112
And this is mine.

36:07.217 --> 36:09.077
And this is mine.

36:09.181 --> 36:10.660
And this is mine.

36:10.764 --> 36:12.622
And...

36:12.726 --> 36:17.125
Well, this is not mine.
Perchik, this is Motel Kamzoil.

36:17.229 --> 36:20.177
So, you did us a favour and came home.

36:22.186 --> 36:24.300
This is also mine.

36:24.405 --> 36:30.889
Golde, this is Perchik from Kiev.
He's staying the Sabbath with us.

36:30.994 --> 36:33.894
He's a teacher.
Would you like lessons from him?

36:33.999 --> 36:36.309
- Yes, Papa.
- I'm a very good teacher.

36:36.414 --> 36:41.154
I heard that the rabbi who must praise
himself has a congregation of one.

36:42.748 --> 36:45.279
Your daughter has
a quick and witty tongue.

36:45.383 --> 36:47.696
The wit she gets from me.

36:47.800 --> 36:51.574
- As the Good Book says...
- The Good Book can wait. Get washed.

36:51.678 --> 36:56.246
- The tongue she gets from her mother.
- Motel, you're also eating with us?

36:56.350 --> 36:59.337
Of course. Another blessing.

36:59.441 --> 37:02.922
Tzeitel, get the small table.
Chava, the chairs from outside.

37:03.027 --> 37:06.759
Children, finish dressing.
You can wash at the well.

37:06.863 --> 37:09.691
Hurry, it's almost the Sabbath.

37:11.193 --> 37:13.067
Tevye.

37:13.946 --> 37:16.099
Tevye, I've something to say to you.

37:16.203 --> 37:18.896
Why should today be different?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.229
I have something to tell you.

37:21.334 --> 37:24.442
- I have something to tell you.
- Yente was here.

37:24.546 --> 37:25.694
I saw her.

37:25.798 --> 37:29.404
If they agree on a match,
it will be too late for us.

37:29.508 --> 37:33.871
But I have found someone who will
sell me his used sewing machine.

37:33.975 --> 37:36.580
In a few weeks, I'll be able to buy it.

37:36.684 --> 37:39.124
- Then your father...
- It might be too late.

37:39.229 --> 37:42.751
- Lazar Wolf wants to see you.
- The butcher? What about?

37:42.855 --> 37:45.297
I don't know.
Only he says it's important.

37:45.401 --> 37:48.757
What can be important?
I have nothing for him to slaughter.

37:48.861 --> 37:51.303
After the Sabbath, talk with him.

37:51.407 --> 37:53.182
About what?

37:53.286 --> 37:58.227
If he's thinking about buying
my new milk cow, he can forget it.

37:58.331 --> 38:00.281
- Tevye, I want you to talk.
- Shh.

38:05.372 --> 38:08.539
Tevye. Tevye, I want you to talk to...

38:13.297 --> 38:16.168
What else can I do?

38:17.218 --> 38:20.580
You could ask my father
for my hand tonight. Now.

38:20.685 --> 38:23.793
Why should he consider me now?
I'm only a poor tailor.

38:23.897 --> 38:26.799
And I'm only the daughter
of a poor milkman.

38:26.903 --> 38:31.770
- Just talk to him.
- If your father says no, that's it.

38:32.858 --> 38:35.056
- He'll yell at me.
- Motel...

38:35.160 --> 38:38.060
- I'm just a poor tailor.
- Motel!

38:38.165 --> 38:41.571
Even a poor tailor
is entitled to some happiness.

38:44.537 --> 38:45.912
That's true.

38:47.665 --> 38:49.402
- Amen.
- Amen.

38:49.506 --> 38:53.823
A man sends you an important a message,
at least you can talk to him.

38:53.927 --> 38:57.328
All right, after the Sabbath I'll talk to him.

38:57.433 --> 39:00.959
All right, I'll talk to him.

39:08.978 --> 39:12.008
It's getting late.

39:12.112 --> 39:15.263
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, Papa.

39:15.367 --> 39:18.972
Children, come down.
We are lighting the candles.

39:19.076 --> 39:23.144
- Reb Tevye...
- Not now, Motel. Hurry up, children.

39:23.248 --> 39:24.896
- Reb Tevye.
- Not now.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.940
Golde, the sun is almost down.

39:28.045 --> 39:30.985
- Reb Tevye...
- What is it?

39:31.089 --> 39:32.570
- Reb Tevye...
- Yes?

39:32.674 --> 39:36.076
- Reb Tevye...
- Yes? Yes? Yes?

39:36.180 --> 39:38.841
Well, Motel, what is it?

39:41.051 --> 39:43.537
Good Sabbath, Reb Tevye.

39:43.641 --> 39:46.128
Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath.

39:47.933 --> 39:49.382
Hurry up.

39:49.486 --> 39:52.892
Hurry, children, hurry. It's getting late.

40:31.185 --> 40:37.262
<i>~ May the Lord protect and defend you ~</i>

40:37.366 --> 40:42.814

42:39.021 --> 42:41.097
Is Reb?

42:43.025 --> 42:46.145
Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?

42:49.823 --> 42:52.393
Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?

42:52.497 --> 42:55.484
- He's in the back.
- Oh.

42:55.589 --> 42:58.782
May I... Hm?

43:00.125 --> 43:03.245
- Come in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

43:16.100 --> 43:19.213
And all this from killing
innocent animals?

43:19.318 --> 43:22.431
- Don't touch anything.
- All right.

43:53.220 --> 43:55.296
Well, Tevye.

43:56.223 --> 43:59.170
You're here. Sit down. Sit down.

43:59.274 --> 44:01.050
Thank you.

44:01.154 --> 44:06.352
- Have a drink.
- I won't insult you by saying no.

44:09.236 --> 44:11.722
How goes it with you, Reb Tevye?

44:11.826 --> 44:14.602
- How should it go?
- You're right.

44:14.706 --> 44:17.231
- And you?
- The same.

44:17.335 --> 44:20.661
I'm sorry to hear that.

44:28.797 --> 44:30.457
Uh...

44:31.467 --> 44:32.870
Uh...

44:32.975 --> 44:37.253
How is your brother-in-law in America?

44:37.357 --> 44:39.795
- He's doing very well.
- He wrote you?

44:39.899 --> 44:42.423
- Not lately.
- How do you know?

44:42.527 --> 44:46.683
If he was doing badly, he would write.

44:49.026 --> 44:51.102
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

44:53.489 --> 44:56.194
- Lechaim.
- Lechaim.

44:59.954 --> 45:02.824
- Tevye.
- Yeah?

45:03.249 --> 45:08.872
I suppose you know
why I wanted to see you.

45:09.213 --> 45:12.121
Yes, I do, but...

45:12.225 --> 45:14.837
There is no use talking about it.

45:18.305 --> 45:21.713
Tevye, I understand how you feel,

45:21.817 --> 45:27.841
but after all you have
a few more without her.

45:27.945 --> 45:32.973
I see. Today you want one.
Tomorrow you may want two.

45:33.077 --> 45:36.810
Two? What would I do with two?

45:36.915 --> 45:40.027
The same as you do with one.

45:49.700 --> 45:52.108
Tevye.

45:52.954 --> 45:56.067
This is very important to me.

45:56.171 --> 45:59.285
Why is it so important to you?

46:00.628 --> 46:04.412
Frankly, because...

46:06.050 --> 46:08.541
I'm lonely.

46:11.097 --> 46:12.917
Lonely?

46:13.022 --> 46:16.755
Reb Lazar,
what are you talking about?

46:16.860 --> 46:19.172
How can a little cow keep you company?

46:19.277 --> 46:21.009
Little cow?

46:21.113 --> 46:24.220
- Is that what you call her?
- But that's what she is.

46:24.324 --> 46:26.599
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you know?

46:26.703 --> 46:31.851
Of course, I know. We are talking about
the milk cow you want to buy from me.

46:31.955 --> 46:34.358
A milk cow.

46:37.582 --> 46:39.954
A milk cow so I won't be lonely?

46:46.132 --> 46:48.701
I'm talking about...

46:48.805 --> 46:52.375
your daughter Tzeitel.

46:52.480 --> 46:55.041
My daughter Tzeitel?

46:55.145 --> 46:57.588
Of course, your daughter Tzeitel.

46:57.692 --> 47:01.719
I see her every Thursday
in my butcher's shop.

47:01.823 --> 47:05.509
And she's made
a very good impression on me.

47:05.614 --> 47:07.763
A very good impression.

47:07.867 --> 47:09.810
Reb Tevye,

47:09.914 --> 47:12.064
I like her.

47:14.285 --> 47:19.492
Why don't we just shake hands
and call it a match, huh?

47:22.627 --> 47:24.613
And...

47:24.717 --> 47:28.247
I will be good to her.

47:28.966 --> 47:30.840
Tevye.

47:33.554 --> 47:35.428
I...

47:36.390 --> 47:39.142
I like her.

47:41.354 --> 47:43.430
Well?

47:44.941 --> 47:47.221
What do you think?

47:47.325 --> 47:49.809
- What do I think?
- Huh?

47:56.369 --> 48:00.192
I never really liked him.

48:00.297 --> 48:04.280
Why should I? You can have
a fine conversation with him

48:04.384 --> 48:07.739
if you talk about kidneys and livers.

48:07.844 --> 48:10.913
On the other hand,

48:11.018 --> 48:15.081
not everyone has to be a scholar.

48:15.185 --> 48:20.802
And with a butcher, my daughter
will surely never know hunger.

48:22.061 --> 48:24.219
Maybe I misjudged him.

48:26.232 --> 48:28.937
He's a good man.

48:30.194 --> 48:32.483
He likes her.

48:34.907 --> 48:38.572
And he'll try to make her happy.

48:42.081 --> 48:43.990
What do I think?

48:45.084 --> 48:47.825
It's a match.

48:47.930 --> 48:50.791
- You agree?
- I agree.

48:51.799 --> 48:55.123
Tevye, you've made me a happy man.

48:55.227 --> 48:58.339
- Let's drink on it.
- Why not?

48:59.599 --> 49:02.296
- To you.
- No, my friend. To you.

49:02.400 --> 49:06.466
- To the both of us.
- To our agreement.

49:06.570 --> 49:09.351
To our prosperity.

49:10.776 --> 49:15.393
To our good health and happiness.

49:15.498 --> 49:17.696
And most important of all...

49:20.453 --> 49:21.901
Well...

49:22.005 --> 49:25.442
<i>~ To life, to life, lechaim ~</i>

49:25.546 --> 49:28.698
<i>~ Lechaim, lechaim, to life ~</i>

<i>~ Life has a way of confusing us ~</i>

49:44.273 --> 49:46.338
<i>~ Blessing and bruising us ~</i>

49:46.442 --> 49:49.142
<i>~ Drink, lechaim, to life ~</i>

49:49.690 --> 49:52.637
<i>~ God would like us to be joyful ~</i>

49:52.741 --> 49:57.352
<i>~ Even when our hearts</i>
<i>lie panting on the floor ~</i>

49:57.456 --> 50:00.107
<i>~ How much more can we be joyful ~</i>

50:00.211 --> 50:04.818
<i>~ When there's really something</i>
<i>to be joyful for ~</i>

50:04.922 --> 50:07.452
<i>~ To life, to life, lechaim ~</i>

50:08.417 --> 50:11.614
<i>~ To Tzeitel my daughter</i>
<i>My wife ~</i>

50:11.719 --> 50:14.160
<i>~ It gives you something to think about ~</i>

50:14.264 --> 50:16.204
<i>~ Something to drink about ~</i>

50:16.309 --> 50:21.711
<i>~ Drink, lechaim, to life ~</i>

50:21.815 --> 50:24.547
- Mordcha!
- Yes? What is it?

50:24.651 --> 50:27.089
- Drinks for everyone.
- What's the big occasion?

50:27.193 --> 50:29.506
I'm taking myself a bride.

50:29.610 --> 50:33.354
- Who's the lucky one?
- Tevye's eldest, Tzeitel.

50:38.030 --> 50:39.729
<i>~ To Lazar Wolf ~</i>

50:39.833 --> 50:41.477

51:00.267 --> 51:02.541
<i>~ Drink, lechaim, to life ~</i>

51:02.646 --> 51:05.502
<i>~ We raise a glass</i>

51:05.606 --> 51:09.462
<i>~ In honour of the great good luck</i>

51:09.566 --> 51:12.759
<i>~ We know that when good fortune</i>

51:12.863 --> 51:16.348
<i>~ It stands to reason we deserve it, too ~</i>

51:16.452 --> 51:19.768
<i>~ To us and our good fortune ~</i>

51:19.872 --> 51:22.855

56:11.351 --> 56:13.882
Tevye?

56:15.389 --> 56:20.718
Tevye, after the marriage,

56:20.822 --> 56:24.136
- we will be related.
- Yeah?

56:24.240 --> 56:28.525
You will be my papa.

56:30.029 --> 56:32.105
Your papa.

56:36.702 --> 56:38.900
Lazar Wolf,

56:39.005 --> 56:42.661
I always wanted a son.

56:44.085 --> 56:48.830
But I wanted one
a little younger than myself.

56:59.558 --> 57:01.931
Good night.

57:11.862 --> 57:15.808
I hear that congratulations
are in order, Tevye.

57:15.912 --> 57:19.443
Thank you, Your Honour. Thank you.

57:20.454 --> 57:22.328
Tevye.

57:23.165 --> 57:25.039
Tevye.

57:29.463 --> 57:31.586
Yes, Your Honour?

57:32.758 --> 57:36.083
I have some news
I think I should tell you as a friend.

57:36.187 --> 57:37.543
Yes, Your Honour?

57:37.648 --> 57:41.500
I'm giving you this news
because I like you.

57:41.605 --> 57:45.100
You're an honest, decent person,
even though you are a Jew.

57:47.607 --> 57:50.009
Thank you, Your Honour.

57:50.113 --> 57:54.854
How often does a man
get a compliment like that?

57:55.448 --> 57:57.934
And the news?

57:58.200 --> 58:05.278
Sometime soon this district is to have
a little unofficial demonstration.

58:06.829 --> 58:08.905
What?

58:11.501 --> 58:13.597
A pogrom here?

58:13.975 --> 58:17.995
No, just a little unofficial demonstration.

58:18.099 --> 58:19.955
Little?

58:20.059 --> 58:21.954
How little?

58:22.058 --> 58:24.206
Just some mischief.

58:24.310 --> 58:29.128
So, if an inspector comes through,
he can see we did our duty.

58:29.232 --> 58:33.217
I don't know why there has to be
this trouble between people.

58:33.321 --> 58:37.138
But I thought I should tell you.

58:37.242 --> 58:40.022
Thank you, Your Honour.

58:41.072 --> 58:43.610
You are a good man.

58:44.742 --> 58:47.106
If I may say so...

58:47.210 --> 58:51.193
It's too bad you're not a Jew.

58:51.298 --> 58:56.036
That's what I like about you.
You're always joking.

59:00.633 --> 59:03.541
Congratulations again for your daughter.

59:03.645 --> 59:06.416
Thank you, Your Honour.

59:06.520 --> 59:10.548
Oh, about the other matter.
It won't be too bad. I wouldn't worry.

59:10.652 --> 59:12.434
Of course not.

59:30.496 --> 59:32.816
Dear God,

59:32.921 --> 59:39.962
did you have to send me news
like that today of all days?

59:41.299 --> 59:46.666
I know we are the chosen people.

59:46.770 --> 59:52.184
But once in a while,
can't you choose someone else?

59:57.982 --> 01:00:00.384
Anyway,

01:00:00.489 --> 01:00:06.737
thank you for sending
a husband for my Tzeitel.

01:00:10.161 --> 01:00:12.237
Lechaim.

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:17.407
Now, after Jacob had
worked for Laban for seven years,

01:01:17.512 --> 01:01:19.701
do you know what happened?

01:01:19.806 --> 01:01:24.204
Laban fooled him
and gave him his ugly daughter Leah.

01:01:24.308 --> 01:01:29.291
So to marry Rachel, Jacob was forced
to work another seven years.

01:01:29.395 --> 01:01:35.476
So, you see, the Bible clearly teaches us
you can never trust an employer.

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.383
And that is what the Bible teaches us?

01:01:38.487 --> 01:01:43.350
That is the lesson of the story of Jacob
if you interpret it correctly.

01:01:43.454 --> 01:01:46.400
- Is your papa up yet?
- No, Mama.

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:51.063
Enough lessons. Back to the house.
There's work to be done.

01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:54.697
Go on, children.
Another story tomorrow.

01:01:59.879 --> 01:02:03.082
That was a very
interesting lesson, Perchik.

01:02:04.342 --> 01:02:07.083
- Do you think so?
- Mmm.

01:02:07.187 --> 01:02:12.711
Although I don't know if the rabbi
would agree with your interpretation.

01:02:12.815 --> 01:02:16.465
Neither, I suppose, would the rabbi's son.

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:19.342
My little sisters talk too much.

01:02:19.447 --> 01:02:22.931
And what do you know about him,
except that he is the rabbi's son?

01:02:23.036 --> 01:02:28.605
At least I know he has no strange ideas
about turning the world upside down.

01:02:28.709 --> 01:02:30.520
Good day, Perchik.

01:02:30.624 --> 01:02:36.151
You have wit, even some intelligence.
Perhaps, but what good is your brain?

01:02:36.255 --> 01:02:39.240
Without curiosity, it is a rusty tool.

01:02:39.345 --> 01:02:40.950
Good day, Hodel.

01:02:41.055 --> 01:02:45.535
We have an old custom here.
A boy talks respectfully to a girl.

01:02:45.639 --> 01:02:49.706
But that is too traditional
for an advanced thinker like you.

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:53.750
Our traditions. Nothing must change.
Everything is perfect as it is.

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:57.840
- We like our ways.
- Our ways are changing all over but here.

01:02:57.944 --> 01:03:03.358
In the city boys and girls are affectionate
without the permission of a matchmaker.

01:03:04.402 --> 01:03:07.726
They hold hands together.
They even dance together.

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:10.360
New dances like this.

01:03:15.997 --> 01:03:18.784
I learned it in Kiev.

01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:25.254
- Do you like it?
- It's very nice.

01:03:43.024 --> 01:03:45.344
There.

01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:48.557
We've just changed an old custom.

01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:50.315
Yes.

01:03:52.283 --> 01:03:55.403
I mean, thank you.

01:03:58.498 --> 01:04:02.661
I mean, good day.

01:04:05.338 --> 01:04:07.414
Go away.

01:04:26.067 --> 01:04:27.727
Oh!

01:04:35.118 --> 01:04:39.235
So, my prince is finally out of bed.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.821
Open your eyes.
The day's half gone.

01:04:42.925 --> 01:04:44.865
Well?

01:04:44.969 --> 01:04:48.823
Well, what happened last night,
besides you drinking like a peasant?

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:51.953
Did you see Lazar Wolf?

01:04:52.058 --> 01:04:54.793
Well? Well?

01:04:54.897 --> 01:04:56.919
What did he say?

01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:59.684
What did you say?

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.885
- Where's Tzeitel?
- She's in the barn.

01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:07.970
Do you have news for me?
Did you talk with Lazar Wolf?

01:05:08.075 --> 01:05:11.732
- What happened?
- Patience, woman, patience.

01:05:13.406 --> 01:05:16.980
As the Good Book says,
"Good news will stay,

01:05:17.085 --> 01:05:19.940
and bad news will refuse to leave."

01:05:20.044 --> 01:05:23.656
- And another saying goes...
- You can die from such a man.

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:29.285
Did you see Lazar? How was it?

01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:31.994
Are you still drunk or what?

01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:34.244
Ah, here she is.

01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:37.168
Tzeitel, my lamb. Come here.

01:05:37.273 --> 01:05:41.125
You are to be congratulated.

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:45.171
- You are going to be married.
Married!

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:48.179
What do you mean, Papa?

01:05:48.284 --> 01:05:51.221
Lazar Wolf has asked for your hand.

01:05:51.325 --> 01:05:54.016
- I knew it.
- The butcher?

01:05:54.121 --> 01:05:56.644
Dear God, I thank thee.

01:05:56.748 --> 01:05:58.727
Why do you have to?

01:05:58.832 --> 01:06:02.151
- What do you have to say, Tzeitel?
- What can she say?

01:06:02.255 --> 01:06:06.375
- Let her say one word.
- My first-born a bride.

01:06:09.462 --> 01:06:13.785
May you grow old with him
in fortune and honour.

01:06:13.889 --> 01:06:16.581
Not like Fruma Sarah, his first wife.

01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.502
She was a bitter woman,
may she rest in peace.

01:06:19.607 --> 01:06:23.459
Not like my Tzeitel.

01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:25.923
And now I must thank Yente.

01:06:26.028 --> 01:06:30.138
My Tzeitel a bride. A bride!

01:06:30.242 --> 01:06:33.557
I thank thee. I thank thee. Oh, a bride!

01:06:33.661 --> 01:06:36.274
Well, Chava?

01:06:37.323 --> 01:06:39.232
Mazel tov, Tzeitel.

01:06:40.243 --> 01:06:42.313
"Mazel tov, Tzeitel."

01:06:42.417 --> 01:06:44.897
What kind of a mazel tov is that?

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:50.326
And you, Reb Perchik,
aren't you going to congratulate her?

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:54.115
Congratulations, Tzeitel,
for getting a rich man.

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:55.869
Ah.

01:06:55.973 --> 01:06:59.829
Again with the rich.
What's wrong with being rich?

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:03.594
It's no reason to marry.
Money's the world's curse.

01:07:04.892 --> 01:07:08.671
May the Lord smite me with it.

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:12.134
And may I never recover.

01:07:12.238 --> 01:07:14.107
World's curse.

01:07:16.279 --> 01:07:21.479
My Tzeitel knows I mean only
her welfare. Am I right, Tzeitel?

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:24.522
- Yes, Papa.
- There, you see?

01:07:24.627 --> 01:07:27.740
I see.
I see very well.

01:07:38.134 --> 01:07:40.371
Well, my child?

01:07:40.475 --> 01:07:43.333
Why are you so silent?

01:07:43.437 --> 01:07:49.008
Aren't you happy with this blessing, huh?

01:07:49.113 --> 01:07:51.845
Papa... Papa...

01:07:51.949 --> 01:07:54.644
What is it? Tell me.

01:07:55.276 --> 01:08:00.560
Papa, I don't want to marry him.
I can't marry him. I can't.

01:08:00.664 --> 01:08:03.020
What do you mean, you can't?

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:07.690
If I say you will, you will.

01:08:07.794 --> 01:08:11.779
If it's a matter of money,
I'll do anything.

01:08:11.883 --> 01:08:14.362
I'll hire myself out as a servant...

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:17.408
But we made an agreement.

01:08:17.513 --> 01:08:20.840
And with us,
an agreement is an agreement.

01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:28.468
Is that more important than I am, Papa?

01:08:33.106 --> 01:08:35.803
Papa, don't force me, please!

01:08:35.907 --> 01:08:39.979
I'll be unhappy all my days.

01:08:43.366 --> 01:08:47.908
- I don't want to marry him.
- All right. All right.

01:08:48.955 --> 01:08:51.243
I won't force you.

01:08:52.207 --> 01:08:55.126
Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you.

01:08:55.877 --> 01:08:58.416
"Thank you, Papa."

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:07.966
It seems it was not ordained that
you should have all the comforts of life.

01:09:17.066 --> 01:09:20.345
- Reb Tevye, may I speak to you?
- Later, Motel.

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:27.242
- But I would like to speak to you.
- Not now. I have problems.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:31.484
That's what I want to speak
to you about. I think I can help.

01:09:31.587 --> 01:09:35.737
Like a bandage can help a corpse.
Goodbye, Motel.

01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:39.032
At least listen to him, Papa.

01:09:39.136 --> 01:09:42.870
All right, you have a tongue. Talk.

01:09:42.974 --> 01:09:45.707
I hear you are arranging
a match for Tzeitel.

01:09:45.813 --> 01:09:47.879
Ah, he also has ears.

01:09:48.348 --> 01:09:50.667
Well...

01:09:50.772 --> 01:09:54.006
- I have a match for Tzeitel.
- What kind of a match?

01:09:54.112 --> 01:09:56.423
A perfect fit.

01:09:56.528 --> 01:09:58.925
Like a glove.

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:01.389
This match was made
exactly to measure.

01:10:01.493 --> 01:10:03.555
Perfect fit? Made to measure?

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:06.895
Stop talking like a tailor
and tell me, who is it?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.911
- Please don't shout at me.
- All right. All right, I won't shout.

01:10:13.957 --> 01:10:16.110
Who is it?

01:10:16.214 --> 01:10:17.946
Who is it?

01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:20.907
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

01:10:21.011 --> 01:10:22.797
Who is it?!

01:10:25.593 --> 01:10:27.669
It's me.

01:10:28.846 --> 01:10:30.839
Myself.

01:10:33.393 --> 01:10:35.469
It's him.

01:10:36.104 --> 01:10:37.635
Himself.

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:42.386
Either you're out of your mind
or you're crazy. He must be crazy.

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:46.098
Arranging a match for yourself?
What are you? Everything?

01:10:46.202 --> 01:10:49.394
Bridegroom, matchmaker,
and guests rolled into one?

01:10:49.498 --> 01:10:52.190
I suppose you'll perform
the ceremony, too?

01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:54.356
Please don't shout at me.

01:10:54.461 --> 01:10:57.613
As for being my matchmaker,
I know it's unusual.

01:10:57.717 --> 01:10:59.695
Unusual? It's crazy.

01:10:59.799 --> 01:11:01.864
Times are changing.

01:11:01.968 --> 01:11:08.084
Over a year ago, Tzeitel and I gave each
other our pledge that we would marry.

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.434
You gave each other a pledge?

01:11:23.569 --> 01:11:25.645
Yes, Papa.

01:11:26.614 --> 01:11:29.698
We gave each other our pledge.

01:11:31.452 --> 01:11:34.232
They gave each other a pledge?

01:11:34.336 --> 01:11:36.694
Unheard of. Absurd.

01:11:36.798 --> 01:11:40.456
<i>~ You gave each other</i>
<i>a pledge - unthinkable ~</i>

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.535
<i>~ Where do you think you are,</i>
<i>in Moscow, in Paris? ~</i>

01:11:45.639 --> 01:11:48.749
<i>~ Where do they think they are, America? ~</i>

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.413
<i>~ What do you think you're doing,</i>
<i>you're a stitcher, you're nothing ~</i>

01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:56.959
<i>~ Who do you think you are,</i>
<i>King Solomon? ~</i>

01:11:57.063 --> 01:12:00.920
<i>~ This isn't the way it's done,</i>
<i>not here, not now ~</i>

01:12:01.024 --> 01:12:07.473
<i>~ Some things I will not,</i>
<i>I cannot allow ~</i>

01:12:09.111 --> 01:12:11.187
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

01:12:11.656 --> 01:12:15.690
<i>~ Marriages must be arranged</i>
<i>by the papa ~</i>

01:12:15.794 --> 01:12:17.816
<i>~ This should never be changed ~</i>

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.151
<i>~ One little time, you pull out a prop and</i>
<i>where does it stop? Where does it stop? ~</i>

01:12:22.256 --> 01:12:24.319
Where does it stop?

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:27.948
Do I still have something
to say about my daughter?

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:31.077
Doesn't anyone have to ask
a father any more?

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:36.669
I've wanted to ask you for a while, but first
I wanted to get my own sewing machine.

01:12:36.773 --> 01:12:39.166
Stop talking nonsense.

01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:41.420
You are just a poor tailor.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:45.516
That's true, but even a poor tailor
is entitled to some happiness.

01:12:57.410 --> 01:13:02.237
I promise you, Reb Tevye,
your daughter will not starve.

01:13:05.334 --> 01:13:10.411
Ah. He's beginning to talk like a man.

01:13:12.008 --> 01:13:14.039
On the other hand,

01:13:14.143 --> 01:13:19.212
what kind of a match
would that be with a poor tailor?

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:27.665
On the other hand,
he is an honest, hard worker.

01:13:27.769 --> 01:13:33.925
But on the other hand,
he has absolutely nothing.

01:13:34.029 --> 01:13:40.273
On the other hand, things could never
get worse for him, only better.

01:13:44.239 --> 01:13:46.936
They gave each other a pledge.

01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:49.692
Unheard of. Absurd.

01:13:49.797 --> 01:13:53.654
<i>~ They gave each other</i>
<i>a pledge - unthinkable ~</i>

01:13:54.916 --> 01:14:01.077
<i>~ But look at my daughter's face,</i>
<i>she loves him, she wants him ~</i>

01:14:01.181 --> 01:14:04.036
<i>~ And look at my daughter's eyes ~</i>

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.337
<i>~ So hopeful ~</i>

01:14:10.307 --> 01:14:12.383
Tradition!

01:14:22.302 --> 01:14:24.378
Well, children...

01:14:25.806 --> 01:14:29.340
When shall we make the wedding?

01:14:30.936 --> 01:14:33.012
Thank you, Papa.

01:14:33.855 --> 01:14:38.223
Reb Tevye, you won't be sorry.
You won't be sorry.

01:14:38.328 --> 01:14:40.388
I won't be sorry?

01:14:40.492 --> 01:14:42.518
I'm sorry already.

01:14:42.622 --> 01:14:44.441
Thank you, Papa.

01:14:44.616 --> 01:14:48.151
- Thank you, Papa.
- All right, all right.

01:14:50.038 --> 01:14:51.912
Papa.

01:14:58.964 --> 01:15:02.249
They gave each other a pledge.

01:15:10.017 --> 01:15:12.093
Golde.

01:15:14.563 --> 01:15:16.472
What shall I tell Golde?

01:15:23.405 --> 01:15:27.901
- Motel, you were wonderful.
- It was a miracle.

01:15:28.535 --> 01:15:31.527
<i>~ Wonder of wonders,</i>
<i>miracle of miracles ~</i>

01:15:31.631 --> 01:15:34.485
<i>~ God took a Daniel once again ~</i>

01:15:34.589 --> 01:15:37.658
<i>~ Stood by his side</i>
<i>and miracle of miracles ~</i>

01:15:37.762 --> 01:15:40.532
<i>~ Walked him through the lion's den ~</i>

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:43.993
<i>~ Wonder of wonders,</i>
<i>miracle of miracles ~</i>

01:15:44.098 --> 01:15:46.872
<i>~ I was afraid that God would frown ~</i>

01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:53.139
<i>~ But like he did so long ago in Jericho,</i>
<i>God just made a wall fall down ~</i>

01:15:56.438 --> 01:16:02.637
<i>~ When Moses softened Pharaoh's heart,</i>
<i>that was a miracle ~</i>

01:16:02.741 --> 01:16:08.851
<i>~ When God made the waters of</i>
<i>the Red Sea part, that was a miracle, too ~</i>

01:16:08.956 --> 01:16:15.482
<i>~ But of all God's miracles large</i>
<i>and small, the most miraculous one of all ~</i>

01:16:15.586 --> 01:16:26.582
<i>~ Is that out of a worthless lump of clay</i>
<i>God has made a man today ~</i>

01:16:26.686 --> 01:16:30.001
<i>~ Wonder of wonders,</i>
<i>miracle of miracles ~</i>

01:16:30.105 --> 01:16:33.043
<i>~ God took a tailor by the hand ~</i>

01:16:33.148 --> 01:16:36.255
<i>~ Turned him around</i>
<i>and miracle of miracles ~</i>

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:39.133
<i>~ Led him to the Promised Land ~</i>

01:16:39.237 --> 01:16:45.679
<i>~ When David slew Goliath,</i>
<i>yes, that was a miracle ~</i>

01:16:45.783 --> 01:16:54.064
<i>~ When God gave us manna</i>
<i>in the wilderness, that was a miracle, too ~</i>

01:16:54.169 --> 01:17:02.288
<i>~ But of all God's miracles large</i>
<i>and small, the most miraculous one of all ~</i>

01:17:03.505 --> 01:17:09.378
<i>~ Is the one I thought could never be ~</i>

01:17:10.053 --> 01:17:18.595
<i>~ God has given you to me ~</i>

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.413
- Good day.
- Hello, Sarah.

01:17:51.518 --> 01:17:55.124
Mazel tov, Chava.
Soon it will be you.

01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:58.131
- I hope so.
- Give my best wishes to Tzeitel.

01:17:58.236 --> 01:18:01.144
- Mazel tov! Mazel tov!
- Goodbye.

01:18:04.232 --> 01:18:09.726
- Mazel tov, Chava.
- Mazel tov, Chava.

01:18:09.831 --> 01:18:11.897
Don't run away...

01:18:16.036 --> 01:18:21.108
No, don't.
Please, I just want... to get by.

01:18:21.212 --> 01:18:23.406
All right, stop it.

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:26.071
- What's wrong with you, Fyedka?
- Stop it.

01:18:26.175 --> 01:18:31.243
- We're just having a little fun, Fyedka.
- Goodbye, Sasha.

01:18:31.347 --> 01:18:33.501
I said goodbye.

01:18:51.571 --> 01:18:54.102
I'm sorry about that.
They mean no harm.

01:18:54.206 --> 01:18:56.275
Don't they?

01:19:09.798 --> 01:19:11.784
Is there something you want?

01:19:11.889 --> 01:19:14.830
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

01:19:14.934 --> 01:19:17.597
I'd rather not.

01:19:18.765 --> 01:19:21.334
I've often noticed you at the bookseller's.

01:19:21.439 --> 01:19:24.925
Not many girls in this village like to read.

01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:28.845
Would you like to borrow this book?

01:19:28.949 --> 01:19:31.647
It's very good.

01:19:34.322 --> 01:19:36.030
No.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.235
- Thank you.
- Why?

01:19:41.339 --> 01:19:44.200
Because I'm not Jewish?

01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:49.740
Do you feel about me
the way they feel about you?

01:19:49.844 --> 01:19:52.673
I didn't think you would.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.413
And what do you know about me, eh?

01:19:57.517 --> 01:20:00.292
Let me tell you about myself.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:02.543
I'm a pleasant fellow.

01:20:02.648 --> 01:20:05.550
Charming, honest,

01:20:05.655 --> 01:20:09.175
ambitious, quite bright,

01:20:09.279 --> 01:20:12.524
and very modest.

01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:23.447
Go ahead. Take the book.

01:20:24.247 --> 01:20:27.655
And after you return it,
I'll ask you how you like it.

01:20:27.759 --> 01:20:30.365
And we can talk about it for a while.

01:20:30.469 --> 01:20:35.420
Then we can talk about life.
How we feel about things.

01:20:36.718 --> 01:20:38.047
Here.

01:20:48.522 --> 01:20:50.763
Thank you.

01:20:53.652 --> 01:20:56.432
- Good day, Chava.
- Good day.

01:20:56.536 --> 01:20:58.606
Fyedka.

01:21:03.912 --> 01:21:05.988
Fyedka.

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:51.986
- Help! Help!
- Tell me, what's the matter with you?

01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:56.119
Wake up. What is
the matter with you? Wake up!

01:21:56.224 --> 01:21:59.206
- Where is she?
- Who?

01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:02.292
- What are you talking about?
- Fruma Sarah.

01:22:02.397 --> 01:22:06.000
Lazar Wolfs first wife
was standing here a minute ago.

01:22:06.104 --> 01:22:10.550
What are you talking about?
Fruma Sarah has been dead for years.

01:22:10.655 --> 01:22:17.388
Sha! You must have been dreaming.
Sha. Sha.

01:22:17.492 --> 01:22:23.312
Now, tell me what you dreamt
and I'll tell you what it meant.

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:25.894
Ooh, it was terrible.

01:22:25.998 --> 01:22:28.396
- Tell me.
- All right.

01:22:28.501 --> 01:22:32.197
Only don't be frightened!

01:22:34.586 --> 01:22:40.579
In the beginning, I dreamt that...

01:22:40.684 --> 01:22:47.129
we were having
a celebration of some kind.

01:22:49.184 --> 01:22:57.096
Everybody we knew,
all of our beloved departed were there.

01:22:58.985 --> 01:23:01.349
All of them.

01:23:01.453 --> 01:23:06.813
Even your Great Uncle
Mordechai was there.

01:23:06.917 --> 01:23:10.983
And your cousin Rachel was there.

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:13.361
And in the middle of the dream,

01:23:13.465 --> 01:23:17.659
in walks your grandmother Tzeitel,
may she rest in peace.

01:23:17.764 --> 01:23:20.829
Grandmother Tzeitel?
How did she look?

01:23:20.933 --> 01:23:25.580
For a woman who is dead 30 years,
she looked very good.

01:23:25.684 --> 01:23:28.625
Naturally, I went up to greet her.

01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:32.714
<i>~ A blessing on your head</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

01:23:32.818 --> 01:23:36.052
<i>~ To see a daughter wed</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

01:23:36.156 --> 01:23:39.722
<i>~ And such a son-in-law</i>
<i>like no one ever saw ~</i>

01:23:39.826 --> 01:23:42.432
<i>~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~</i>

01:23:42.536 --> 01:23:43.767
Motel?

01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:47.310
<i>~ A worthy boy is he</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

01:23:47.414 --> 01:23:50.606
<i>~ Of pious family</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:54.361
<i>~ They named him after my</i>
<i>dear Uncle Mordechai ~</i>

01:23:54.465 --> 01:23:56.489
<i>~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~</i>

01:23:56.593 --> 01:23:57.988
Tailor?

01:23:58.092 --> 01:24:01.865
- She heard wrong. It's the butcher.
- I'll tell her.

01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:04.828
<i>~ You must have heard wrong, Grandma ~</i>

01:24:04.933 --> 01:24:07.624
<i>~ There's no tailor ~</i>

01:24:07.728 --> 01:24:08.792
Huh?

01:24:08.896 --> 01:24:12.002
<i>~ You mean the butcher, Grandma ~</i>

01:24:12.106 --> 01:24:13.754
<i>~ By the name of Lazar Wolf ~</i>

01:24:13.858 --> 01:24:18.424
<i>~ No, no, no</i>
<i>I mean the tailor, Tevye ~</i>

01:24:18.528 --> 01:24:21.303
<i>~ My great grandchild ~</i>

01:24:21.407 --> 01:24:24.931
<i>~ My little Tzeitel, who you named for me ~</i>

01:24:25.035 --> 01:24:28.853
<i>~ Motel's bride was meant to be ~</i>

01:24:28.958 --> 01:24:32.147
<i>~ For such a match I prayed</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

01:24:32.252 --> 01:24:35.902
<i>~ In heaven it was made</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

01:24:36.006 --> 01:24:39.407
<i>~ A fine, upstanding boy,</i>
<i>a comfort and a joy ~</i>

01:24:39.511 --> 01:24:40.989
<i>~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~</i>

01:24:41.094 --> 01:24:44.534
But let me explain to you. Stop!

01:24:44.638 --> 01:24:47.830
We announced it already.
We made a bargain with the butcher.

01:24:47.934 --> 01:24:51.003
<i>~ A blessing on your house</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

01:24:51.107 --> 01:24:54.089
<i>~ Imagine such a spouse</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

01:24:54.193 --> 01:24:57.425
<i>~ And such a son-in-law</i>
<i>like no one ever saw ~</i>

01:24:57.529 --> 01:25:00.883
- Stop them.
Listen to me. But he is a butcher.

01:25:00.988 --> 01:25:03.680
Tell them.
- His name is Lazar Wolf.

01:25:03.784 --> 01:25:06.944
<i>~ The tailor Motel Kam...</i>
<i>Sha! Sha! ~</i>

01:25:08.448 --> 01:25:10.396

<i>~ Who comes here?</i>
<i>Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? ~</i>

01:25:15.497 --> 01:25:18.904
<i>~ What woman is this,</i>

01:25:19.009 --> 01:25:20.782
<i>~ Could it be</i>
<i>Yes, it could ~</i>

01:25:20.887 --> 01:25:23.997
<i>~ Why not?</i>
<i>Who could be mistaken? ~</i>

<i>Fruma Sarah ~</i>

Tevye!

<i>~ What is this about your daughter</i>

01:25:47.413 --> 01:25:48.597
<i>~ Yes, her husband ~</i>

<i>~ Would you do this to your friend</i>
<i>and neighbour Fruma Sarah? ~</i>

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:52.492
<i>~ Fruma Sarah ~</i>

01:25:52.597 --> 01:25:55.400
<i>~ Have you no consideration</i>

01:25:55.505 --> 01:25:56.605
<i>~ Woman's feelings ~</i>

<i>~ Handing over my belongings</i>

01:25:59.589 --> 01:26:00.623

01:26:08.975 --> 01:26:11.136
<i>~ How can you allow your daughter</i>

01:26:16.067 --> 01:26:19.177
Tevye!

01:26:23.815 --> 01:26:25.974
<i>~ Such a learned man as Tevye</i>

01:26:30.453 --> 01:26:31.446

<i>~ I'll come to her by night ~</i>

01:27:11.238 --> 01:27:15.100
<i>~ I'll take her by the throat ~</i>

01:27:15.204 --> 01:27:20.076
<i>~ And this I'll give your Tzeitel,</i>
<i>that I'll give your Tzeitel ~</i>

01:27:32.509 --> 01:27:34.585
Jump!

01:27:36.763 --> 01:27:45.177
Here's my wedding present
if she marries Lazar Wolf!

01:27:45.281 --> 01:27:48.385
Evil spirit, away.

01:27:48.489 --> 01:27:50.431
Such an evil spirit.

01:27:50.535 --> 01:27:53.973
May it sink back into the earth.

01:27:54.077 --> 01:27:57.934
Such a dark and horrible dream.

01:27:58.039 --> 01:28:02.191
And to think it was brought on
because you went to see that butcher.

01:28:02.295 --> 01:28:03.737
Tevye...

01:28:03.841 --> 01:28:08.200
If my grandmother Tzeitel,
may she rest in peace,

01:28:08.304 --> 01:28:13.162
took the trouble to come from
the other world to tell us about the tailor,

01:28:13.266 --> 01:28:17.248
all I can say is that it's for the best
and couldn't possibly be any better.

01:28:17.353 --> 01:28:19.248
- But, Golde...
- Amen.

01:28:19.353 --> 01:28:21.423
Amen.

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:31.684
Cu-cu-cooo!

01:29:31.570 --> 01:29:35.604
Do you like these troublemakers?
These Christ-killers?

01:29:35.708 --> 01:29:37.897
Of course not.

01:29:38.001 --> 01:29:42.287
I just meant that things
have been peaceful here.

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:47.365
I have other villages to visit.

01:29:47.469 --> 01:29:52.328
If you don't want to follow orders,
we shall get someone else who will.

01:29:52.432 --> 01:29:56.208
Oh, no, no, no, no, sir.
I'll take care of it. Of course.

01:31:51.918 --> 01:31:54.782
Quiet down. Quiet down.

01:31:54.886 --> 01:31:58.083
Quiet down.

01:32:39.758 --> 01:32:46.462
<i>~ Is this the little girl I carried? ~</i>

01:32:46.566 --> 01:32:52.966
<i>~ Is this the little boy at play? ~</i>

01:32:53.070 --> 01:33:00.017
<i>~ I don't remember growing older ~</i>

01:33:00.121 --> 01:33:05.402
<i>~ When did they? ~</i>

01:33:06.076 --> 01:33:12.524
<i>~ When did she</i>
<i>get to be a beauty? ~</i>

01:33:12.628 --> 01:33:17.203
<i>~ When did he grow to be so tall? ~</i>

01:33:19.131 --> 01:33:29.262
<i>~ Wasn't it yesterday</i>
<i>when they were small? ~</i>

01:33:33.687 --> 01:33:39.719
<i>~ Sunrise, sunset,</i>
<i>sunrise, sunset ~</i>

01:33:39.823 --> 01:33:46.311
<i>~ Swiftly flow the days ~</i>

01:33:46.415 --> 01:33:52.856
<i>~ Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers ~</i>

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:59.409
<i>~ Blossoming even as we gaze ~</i>

01:33:59.963 --> 01:34:05.829
<i>~ Sunrise, sunset,</i>
<i>sunrise, sunset ~</i>

01:34:05.934 --> 01:34:12.210
<i>~ Swiftly fly the years ~</i>

01:34:12.314 --> 01:34:18.674
<i>~ One season following another ~</i>

01:34:18.778 --> 01:34:27.279
<i>~ Laden with happiness and tears ~</i>

01:34:31.119 --> 01:34:38.112
<i>~ What words of wisdom</i>
<i>can I give them? ~</i>

01:34:38.216 --> 01:34:44.536
<i>~ How can I help to ease their way? ~</i>

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:51.126
<i>~ Now they must</i>
<i>learn from one another ~</i>

01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:57.255
<i>~ Day by day ~</i>

01:34:57.359 --> 01:35:03.514
<i>~ They look so natural together ~</i>

01:35:03.618 --> 01:35:09.936
<i>~ Just like two newlyweds</i>
<i>should be ~</i>

01:35:10.041 --> 01:35:20.497
<i>~ Is there a canopy in store for me? ~</i>

01:35:24.756 --> 01:35:31.498
<i>~ Sunrise, sunset,</i>
<i>sunrise, sunset ~</i>

01:35:31.603 --> 01:35:37.712
<i>~ Swiftly fly the years ~</i>

01:35:37.816 --> 01:35:45.470
<i>~ One season following another ~</i>

01:35:45.574 --> 01:35:50.685
<i>~ Laden with happiness ~</i>

01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:58.078
<i>~ And tears ~</i>

01:36:10.469 --> 01:36:11.963
Mazel tov!

01:37:13.657 --> 01:37:16.990
Quiet down. Quiet down.

01:37:22.749 --> 01:37:25.157
Quiet down.

01:40:10.834 --> 01:40:14.031
Take your places, everybody. Quiet!

01:40:14.135 --> 01:40:18.452
Quiet down. Quiet down.

01:40:18.556 --> 01:40:20.914
Quiet down.

01:40:21.018 --> 01:40:23.087
Sha!

01:40:24.681 --> 01:40:26.879
The newlyweds.

01:40:26.983 --> 01:40:33.340
Friends, we are gathered here
to share in the joys of the newlyweds,

01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:35.638
Motel and Tzeitel.

01:40:35.742 --> 01:40:38.847
May they live together to a ripe old age.

01:40:38.952 --> 01:40:41.770
- Amen.
Amen.

01:40:41.874 --> 01:40:45.644
- And now I want to say...
- Ni, ni, ni, ni, ni...

01:40:45.748 --> 01:40:47.398
Reb Nachum...

01:40:47.502 --> 01:40:51.070
Please not here.

01:40:51.174 --> 01:40:56.199
I'd like to announce the bride's parents
are giving the newlyweds the following:

01:40:56.303 --> 01:40:59.659
A new feather bed, two pillows.

01:40:59.763 --> 01:41:02.289
Goose pillows.

01:41:02.393 --> 01:41:05.915
A Sabbath tablecloth.

01:41:06.019 --> 01:41:08.137
And a pair of candlesticks.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.069
Quiet!

01:41:13.174 --> 01:41:14.989
Now,

01:41:15.093 --> 01:41:18.201
we are just here on earth
for a short visit.

01:41:18.305 --> 01:41:22.371
Even the great and wealthy must die.

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:27.253
In fact, if the rich could hire others
to die for them,

01:41:27.358 --> 01:41:31.014
we, the poor, would all make a nice living.

01:41:32.271 --> 01:41:34.809
Well put. Well put.

01:41:36.025 --> 01:41:39.559
Lazar Wolf, talking about the rich,

01:41:40.279 --> 01:41:43.892
there sits our good friend Lazar Wolf.

01:41:43.996 --> 01:41:49.910
Lazar has everything in the world,
except a bride.

01:41:50.831 --> 01:41:53.945
But Lazar has no ill feelings.

01:41:54.049 --> 01:41:59.909
In fact, he told me he has a gift for the
newlyweds that he wants to announce.

01:42:00.013 --> 01:42:03.091
Come on. Come on!

01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:11.628
Just like he said, I have no ill feelings.

01:42:11.732 --> 01:42:15.584
What's done is done.

01:42:15.688 --> 01:42:20.423
I am giving the newlyweds five chickens.

01:42:20.528 --> 01:42:28.352
One for each of the first five
Sabbaths of their wedded life.

01:42:35.662 --> 01:42:37.899
Reb Lazar Wolf,

01:42:38.003 --> 01:42:40.235
you are a decent man.

01:42:40.339 --> 01:42:45.701
On behalf of my daughter
and her new husband,

01:42:45.805 --> 01:42:48.502
I accept your gift.

01:42:48.842 --> 01:42:50.745
There is a famous saying...

01:42:50.850 --> 01:42:54.041
Reb Tevye,
I'm not marrying your daughter.

01:42:54.146 --> 01:42:56.881
I don't have to listen to your sayings.

01:42:56.985 --> 01:42:58.546
If you would only listen...

01:42:58.650 --> 01:43:03.466
Why should I listen to you?
A man who breaks an agreement.

01:43:03.571 --> 01:43:06.890
- I have a right to talk.
- What right? It's not your wedding.

01:43:06.994 --> 01:43:09.977
- It should have been.
- It's not, thank goodness.

01:43:10.081 --> 01:43:11.770
Sit down.

01:43:11.875 --> 01:43:17.286
He shamed me
in front of the whole village.

01:43:17.788 --> 01:43:20.357
Sha!

01:43:20.461 --> 01:43:23.571
Rabbi, say something.

01:43:23.675 --> 01:43:25.745
I say...

01:43:26.797 --> 01:43:30.842
I say, let's sit down.

01:43:31.927 --> 01:43:35.501
Yes, yes.
We all heard the words of the rabbi.

01:43:35.606 --> 01:43:37.545
Let's sit down.

01:43:37.649 --> 01:43:40.891
Now I'm going to sing a little song.

01:43:43.564 --> 01:43:47.893
<i>~ Dai-dai dai</i>
<i>deedle deedle dai-dai ~</i>

01:43:49.737 --> 01:43:53.106
I don't want your apple.
Leave me alone.

01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:57.731
You can keep your diseased chickens.

01:43:57.835 --> 01:44:00.985
You leave my chickens out of this.

01:44:01.090 --> 01:44:04.239
- We made a bargain.
- The terms weren't settled.

01:44:04.343 --> 01:44:06.865
- We drank on it.
- Terms weren't settled.

01:44:06.969 --> 01:44:08.826
You just sit down, all right?

01:44:08.931 --> 01:44:11.492
Once a butcher, always a butcher.

01:44:11.596 --> 01:44:14.842
- Once a liar, always a liar.
- Sit down, all right?

01:44:15.721 --> 01:44:19.250
Those happen to be my chickens...

01:44:19.355 --> 01:44:23.846
- I had a sign.
- Quiet, I'm singing.

01:44:24.188 --> 01:44:27.550
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

01:44:27.655 --> 01:44:30.052
What's all the screaming about?

01:44:30.156 --> 01:44:32.683
They drank on it. An agreement.

01:44:32.787 --> 01:44:35.643
A sign. It's all nonsense.

01:44:35.747 --> 01:44:38.604
Tzeitel wanted to marry Motel
and not Lazar.

01:44:38.708 --> 01:44:40.855
A young girl decides for herself?

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.152
Why not? They love each other.

01:44:43.257 --> 01:44:46.028
- Love?
- He's a radical.

01:44:46.133 --> 01:44:50.949
Musicians, play.
It's a dance. Everybody, dance.

01:44:51.053 --> 01:44:53.579
- It's a wedding.
Some wedding

01:44:53.683 --> 01:44:55.745
- What is he doing?
- Perchik!

01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:58.503
Who will dance with me?

01:44:58.608 --> 01:45:00.917
- That's a sin.
- It's no sin to dance.

01:45:01.021 --> 01:45:02.548
- With a girl?
- Yes!

01:45:02.652 --> 01:45:05.840
That's what comes
from taking a wild man into your house.

01:45:05.944 --> 01:45:10.555
He's not a wild man. His ideas are
a bit different, but... Perchik, come here.

01:45:10.659 --> 01:45:13.431
- It's a sin.
- It's no sin!

01:45:13.535 --> 01:45:16.732
Ask the rabbi. Go on, ask him.

01:45:18.158 --> 01:45:20.356
Well, Rabbi?

01:45:20.461 --> 01:45:22.439
Dancing?

01:45:22.543 --> 01:45:25.651
Well, it's not exactly forbidden.

01:45:25.755 --> 01:45:28.196
There you see. It's not forbidden.

01:45:28.301 --> 01:45:31.157
And it's no sin. Now...

01:45:31.261 --> 01:45:34.375
Who will dance with me?

01:45:44.727 --> 01:45:49.104
- Hodel!
- It's only a dance, Mama.

01:45:51.775 --> 01:45:53.851
Play.

01:46:10.711 --> 01:46:15.954
- She's dancing with a man.
- I can see that she's dancing with a man.

01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:23.419
- And I'm going to dance with my wife!
- Tevye!

01:46:24.808 --> 01:46:26.673
- Mama, no.
- Golde.

01:46:26.777 --> 01:46:28.845
Golde!

01:46:29.355 --> 01:46:31.228
Golde!

01:46:33.609 --> 01:46:35.096
- No, I will not.
- Tzeitel!

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.067
Motel!

01:46:42.826 --> 01:46:46.401
You see that?
You are responsible for that.

01:46:46.505 --> 01:46:49.996
- And I can't stand it.
- I tried my best.

01:46:59.635 --> 01:47:02.042
Everybody dance.

01:47:21.865 --> 01:47:24.435
Come on. Dance, Rabbi, dance!

01:47:24.539 --> 01:47:26.611
Hey!

01:48:16.670 --> 01:48:17.713
Go on!

01:48:37.649 --> 01:48:39.303
Perchik!

01:48:39.407 --> 01:48:42.153
Perchik!

01:48:44.239 --> 01:48:47.655
All right! Enough!

01:48:52.331 --> 01:48:55.581
I said, enough! Come!

01:49:12.226 --> 01:49:14.379
Orders are orders.

01:49:14.483 --> 01:49:16.767
You understand?

01:49:52.599 --> 01:49:54.675
Well...

01:49:56.353 --> 01:49:59.722
Why are you all standing around?

01:50:00.733 --> 01:50:02.809
Clean up.

01:50:06.196 --> 01:50:08.522
Clean up!

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:27.832
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

01:53:27.936 --> 01:53:29.801
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

01:53:30.931 --> 01:53:32.207
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

01:53:32.311 --> 01:53:34.627
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

01:53:34.731 --> 01:53:36.600
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

01:53:37.646 --> 01:53:39.519
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

01:54:02.754 --> 01:54:06.088
Troubles, troubles.

01:54:07.133 --> 01:54:10.708
That's all you hear from me, right?

01:54:10.812 --> 01:54:16.759
But who else can we simple people
take our troubles to?

01:54:18.812 --> 01:54:24.268
You know, sometimes I wonder,
who do you take your troubles to?

01:54:27.487 --> 01:54:30.358
Ah, go away.

01:54:36.162 --> 01:54:41.501
Anyway, Motel and Tzeitel
have been married for some time now.

01:54:43.461 --> 01:54:46.325
They work very hard.

01:54:46.429 --> 01:54:52.342
And they're as poor as squirrels in winter.

01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:58.887
But they're so happy,
they don't know how miserable they are.

01:55:05.525 --> 01:55:09.182
Motel keeps talking about
a sewing machine.

01:55:09.286 --> 01:55:13.269
I know. You are very busy now.

01:55:13.374 --> 01:55:15.936
Wars, revolutions, floods, plagues.

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:21.069
All those little things
that bring people back to you.

01:55:21.173 --> 01:55:27.880
But couldn't you take a second
and get him his sewing machine?

01:55:28.465 --> 01:55:32.871
Yeah, and while
you are in the neighbourhood...

01:55:32.975 --> 01:55:37.042
As you can see, my horse's leg...

01:55:37.146 --> 01:55:39.671
Am I bothering you too much?

01:55:39.775 --> 01:55:43.969
I'm sorry. As the Good Book says...

01:55:44.073 --> 01:55:48.476
Why should I tell <i>you</i>
what the Good Book says?!

01:55:56.409 --> 01:55:59.023
So you must go away?

01:55:59.128 --> 01:56:00.941
Yes.

01:56:01.045 --> 01:56:03.486
So soon?

01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:05.486
Yes.

01:56:05.590 --> 01:56:07.910
Tomorrow morning.

01:56:12.092 --> 01:56:13.413
Alone?

01:56:13.517 --> 01:56:16.585
No, with a few friends.
And we will be joining others.

01:56:16.689 --> 01:56:19.959
- Where?
- In the city, Kiev.

01:56:20.063 --> 01:56:25.265
Hodel, there are some things
I cannot tell even you.

01:56:26.481 --> 01:56:28.557
I see.

01:56:29.609 --> 01:56:33.849
- Please don't be upset.
- If you must leave, you must.

01:56:33.953 --> 01:56:36.349
- I do have to.
- So you told me.

01:56:36.454 --> 01:56:41.483
Great changes are about to take place.
Tremendous changes.

01:56:41.587 --> 01:56:43.943
But they can't happen by themselves.

01:56:44.048 --> 01:56:48.075
- So you feel that you, personally, must...
- Not only me. Many people.

01:56:48.179 --> 01:56:52.287
Jews, Gentiles, many people hate
what's going on. Don't you understand?

01:56:52.391 --> 01:56:55.539
I understand, of course.

01:56:55.644 --> 01:56:58.249
You want to leave.

01:56:58.354 --> 01:57:01.626
Then, goodbye.

01:57:01.730 --> 01:57:03.628
Hodel, listen to me.

01:57:03.732 --> 01:57:08.934
I have work to do.
The greatest work a man can do.

01:57:11.776 --> 01:57:14.777
Don't you understand?

01:57:15.864 --> 01:57:18.355
Yes, Perchik.

01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:24.446
Hodel... Hodel!

01:57:25.457 --> 01:57:27.655
Hodel, wait.

01:57:27.759 --> 01:57:32.035
Hodel, there's a certain question
I wish to discuss with you.

01:57:32.139 --> 01:57:34.789
- Yes?
- It's a political question.

01:57:34.893 --> 01:57:39.759
- What is it?
- The question of... marriage.

01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:44.754
Is this a political question?

01:57:44.858 --> 01:57:46.715
Well, yes.

01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:49.969
Everything's political.

01:57:50.073 --> 01:57:56.233
The relationship between a man and
a woman has a socioeconomic base.

01:57:57.572 --> 01:58:02.395
Marriage must be
founded on mutual beliefs.

01:58:02.499 --> 01:58:05.569
A common attitude
and philosophy towards society...

01:58:05.673 --> 01:58:08.027
And affection?

01:58:08.132 --> 01:58:10.239
Yes, of course.

01:58:10.343 --> 01:58:13.742
That is also necessary.

01:58:13.847 --> 01:58:18.539
Such a relationship
can have positive social values.

01:58:18.643 --> 01:58:22.791
When two people face the world
with unity and solidarity...

01:58:22.895 --> 01:58:27.635
- And affection?
- Yes, that is an important element.

01:58:30.563 --> 01:58:33.049
At any rate, I...

01:58:33.154 --> 01:58:38.226
I personally am in favour of
such a socioeconomic relationship.

01:58:41.408 --> 01:58:43.484
I think...

01:58:44.703 --> 01:58:47.538
you are asking me to marry you.

01:58:49.499 --> 01:58:51.530
Well,

01:58:51.635 --> 01:58:56.253
in a theoretical sense, yes, I am.

01:58:57.632 --> 01:58:59.755
I was hoping you were.

01:59:04.264 --> 01:59:07.294
I am very happy, Hodel.

01:59:07.398 --> 01:59:10.227
I'm very, very happy.

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:43.875
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Reb Tevye.

01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:47.211
- I have some bad news.
- What?

01:59:47.315 --> 01:59:49.754
- I must leave here.
- When?

01:59:49.858 --> 01:59:54.219
- Tomorrow morning.
- I'm sorry to hear that, Perchik.

01:59:54.323 --> 01:59:57.927
- We'll all miss you.
- But I also have some good news.

01:59:58.031 --> 02:00:00.096
- Good.
- You can congratulate me.

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.475
- Congratulations. What for?
- We are engaged.

02:00:04.190 --> 02:00:07.090
- Engaged?
- Yes, Papa, we're engaged.

02:00:07.195 --> 02:00:12.091
Oh, no, you're not.
I know you like him and he likes you.

02:00:12.195 --> 02:00:15.930
But you're going away
and you're staying here.

02:00:16.035 --> 02:00:18.974
So have a nice trip,
and I hope you'll be very happy

02:00:19.078 --> 02:00:21.103
and my answer is no.

02:00:21.208 --> 02:00:24.440
- Papa, you don't understand.
- I understand.

02:00:24.544 --> 02:00:29.819
I gave my permission to Motel and
Tzeitel, so you feel you also have a right.

02:00:29.924 --> 02:00:32.863
I'm sorry, Perchik, I like you.

02:00:32.967 --> 02:00:36.075
But you're going away,
so go in good health,

02:00:36.179 --> 02:00:38.120
and my answer is still no.

02:00:38.225 --> 02:00:42.668
- You don't understand, Papa.
- And you are not listening. I said no.

02:00:42.772 --> 02:00:45.920
Reb Tevye, we are not asking
for your permission.

02:00:46.024 --> 02:00:49.340
Only for your blessing.

02:00:49.444 --> 02:00:53.564
We <i>are</i> going to get married.

02:00:58.403 --> 02:01:02.401
You are not asking for my permission?

02:01:04.576 --> 02:01:08.870
But we would like your blessing, Papa.

02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:15.114
I can't believe my own ears.

02:01:15.218 --> 02:01:17.826
My blessing? For what?

02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:21.957
<i>~ For going over my head - impossible ~</i>

02:01:22.061 --> 02:01:26.208
<i>~ At least with Tzeitel and Motel</i>
<i>they asked me, they begged me ~</i>

02:01:26.312 --> 02:01:30.085
<i>~ But now, if I like or not,</i>
<i>you'll marry him ~</i>

02:01:30.189 --> 02:01:33.880
<i>~ What do you want from me -</i>
<i>go on, be wed ~</i>

02:01:33.985 --> 02:01:39.354
<i>~ And tear out my beard</i>
<i>and uncover my head ~</i>

02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.600
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

02:01:43.705 --> 02:01:48.354
<i>~ They're not even asking permission</i>
<i>from the papa ~</i>

02:01:48.458 --> 02:01:50.773
<i>~ What's happening to the tradition? ~</i>

02:01:50.877 --> 02:01:55.362
<i>~ One little time, I pulled out a thread</i>
<i>and where has it led? Where has it led? ~</i>

02:01:55.466 --> 02:01:57.780
Where has it led? To this.

02:01:57.884 --> 02:02:02.580
A man tells me he's getting married.
He doesn't ask me, he tells me.

02:02:02.684 --> 02:02:04.874
But first, he abandons you.

02:02:04.978 --> 02:02:07.084
He's not abandoning me, Papa.

02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:10.959
As soon as I can,
I will send for her and marry her.

02:02:11.063 --> 02:02:13.135
I love her.

02:02:16.064 --> 02:02:18.353
He loves her.

02:02:19.359 --> 02:02:23.727
Love. It's a new style.

02:02:23.831 --> 02:02:25.725
On the other hand,

02:02:25.829 --> 02:02:30.275
our old ways were once new,
weren't they?

02:02:30.379 --> 02:02:33.733
On the other hand,
they decided without parents,

02:02:33.837 --> 02:02:37.029
without the matchmaker.

02:02:37.133 --> 02:02:39.158
On the other hand,

02:02:39.262 --> 02:02:44.204
did Adam and Eve have a matchmaker?

02:02:44.308 --> 02:02:47.996
Oh, yes, they did.

02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:53.303
And it seems these two
have the same matchmaker.

02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:59.594
They're going over my head.

02:02:59.698 --> 02:03:02.138
Unheard of. Absurd.

02:03:02.243 --> 02:03:08.267
<i>~ For this, they want</i>
<i>to be blessed - unthinkable ~</i>

02:03:08.372 --> 02:03:10.897
I'll lock her up in her room.

02:03:11.001 --> 02:03:13.902
I couldn't. I should.

02:03:14.006 --> 02:03:17.488
<i>~ But look at my daughter's eyes ~</i>

02:03:17.592 --> 02:03:20.668
<i>~ She loves him ~</i>

02:03:23.673 --> 02:03:28.003
Tradition!

02:03:32.974 --> 02:03:38.561
Well, children, I've decided to give you
my blessing <i>and</i> my permission.

02:03:40.273 --> 02:03:44.180
Oh, thank you, Papa.

02:03:44.285 --> 02:03:46.014
What else could I do?

02:03:46.119 --> 02:03:47.939
Thank you, Papa.

02:03:48.114 --> 02:03:51.032
"Thank you, Papa"?

02:03:52.661 --> 02:03:55.275
What am I going to tell your mother?

02:03:55.379 --> 02:03:57.863
Another dream?

02:04:00.293 --> 02:04:03.906
Perhaps if you tell her
I am going to visit a rich uncle.

02:04:04.011 --> 02:04:08.466
Perchik, please.
I can handle my own wife.

02:04:09.219 --> 02:04:12.339
Golde! Golde!

02:04:13.056 --> 02:04:15.179
- Gol...
- Hm?

02:04:17.394 --> 02:04:20.514
- Hello, Golde.
- Have some soup.

02:04:24.192 --> 02:04:26.066
Golde...

02:04:27.237 --> 02:04:30.267
I have something
very important to tell you.

02:04:30.371 --> 02:04:33.699
Have the soup. It's warm.

02:04:38.415 --> 02:04:40.289
Golde.

02:04:41.293 --> 02:04:45.071
I've just met Perchik and Hodel.

02:04:45.176 --> 02:04:47.460
- Well?
- Well...

02:04:48.758 --> 02:04:50.995
Well, uh...

02:04:51.099 --> 02:04:54.669
Well, they seem to be
very fond of each other.

02:04:54.773 --> 02:04:57.137
So? What do you mean?

02:04:57.893 --> 02:04:59.766
So...

02:05:01.938 --> 02:05:07.554
So, I've decided to give them
my permission to become engaged.

02:05:07.659 --> 02:05:09.555
- I'll eat later.
- What?

02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:12.895
Just like that, without even asking me?

02:05:12.999 --> 02:05:15.482
Who asks you?

02:05:16.495 --> 02:05:19.192
- I am the father.
- Who is he?

02:05:19.296 --> 02:05:23.868
A pauper. He has nothing,
absolutely nothing.

02:05:26.171 --> 02:05:29.088
I wouldn't say that.

02:05:31.301 --> 02:05:34.875
I hear he has a rich uncle.

02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:38.091
A rich uncle.

02:05:42.479 --> 02:05:44.353
Golde...

02:05:46.274 --> 02:05:49.266
Golde, he's a good man.

02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:54.477
I like him.
He's a little crazy, but I like him.

02:05:54.582 --> 02:05:59.651
And what's more important,

02:06:00.914 --> 02:06:03.405
Hodel likes him.

02:06:04.751 --> 02:06:07.456
Hodel loves him.

02:06:09.548 --> 02:06:12.667
So what can we do?

02:06:14.010 --> 02:06:18.083
It's a new world, Golde.

02:06:18.187 --> 02:06:20.886
A new world.

02:06:22.769 --> 02:06:24.845
Love.

02:06:28.608 --> 02:06:30.806
Golde,

02:06:30.911 --> 02:06:33.358
do you love me?

02:06:33.989 --> 02:06:36.058
- Do I what?
- Shh.

02:06:36.163 --> 02:06:38.982
<i>~ Do you love me? ~</i>

02:06:39.086 --> 02:06:41.358
<i>~ Do I love you? ~</i>

02:06:41.462 --> 02:06:42.858
Well?

02:06:42.962 --> 02:06:47.362
<i>~ With our daughters getting married</i>
<i>and this trouble in the town ~</i>

02:06:47.467 --> 02:06:51.458
<i>~ You're upset, you're worn out,</i>
<i>go inside, go lie down ~</i>

02:06:52.007 --> 02:06:58.250
- Maybe it's indigestion.
- No, Golde, I'm asking you a question.

02:06:58.355 --> 02:07:00.960
<i>~ Do you love me? ~</i>

02:07:01.065 --> 02:07:04.049
- You're a fool.
- I know.

02:07:04.153 --> 02:07:07.468
<i>~ But do you love me? ~</i>

02:07:07.572 --> 02:07:11.093
<i>~ Do I love you?</i>
<i>Well? ~</i>

02:07:11.198 --> 02:07:14.267
<i>~ For 25 years, I've washed your clothes ~</i>

02:07:14.372 --> 02:07:16.810
<i>~ Cooked your meals,</i>
<i>cleaned your house ~</i>

02:07:16.914 --> 02:07:19.770
<i>~ Given you children, milked your cow ~</i>

02:07:19.874 --> 02:07:24.984
<i>~ After 25 years,</i>
<i>why talk about love right now? ~</i>

02:07:25.089 --> 02:07:26.697
Golde.

02:07:26.801 --> 02:07:31.159
<i>~ The first time I met you</i>
<i>was on our wedding day ~</i>

02:07:31.264 --> 02:07:33.702
<i>~ I was scared</i>
<i>I was shy ~</i>

02:07:33.806 --> 02:07:36.790
<i>~ I was nervous</i>
<i>So was I ~</i>

02:07:36.894 --> 02:07:42.584
<i>~ But my father and my mother said</i>
<i>we'd learn to love each other ~</i>

02:07:42.689 --> 02:07:45.712
<i>~ And now I'm asking, Golde ~</i>

02:07:45.817 --> 02:07:48.552
<i>~ Do you love me? ~</i>

02:07:48.656 --> 02:07:51.388
- I'm your wife.
- I know.

02:07:51.492 --> 02:07:54.603
<i>~ But do you love me? ~</i>

02:07:55.779 --> 02:07:58.309
<i>~ Do I love him? ~</i>

02:07:58.414 --> 02:08:00.726
Well?

02:08:00.831 --> 02:08:03.484
<i>~ For 25 years, I've lived with him ~</i>

02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:06.403
<i>~ Fought with him, starved with him ~</i>

02:08:06.507 --> 02:08:10.738
<i>~ 25 years, my bed is his ~</i>
<i>Shh!</i>

02:08:10.842 --> 02:08:14.576
<i>~ If that's not love, what is? ~</i>

02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:18.505
<i>~ Then you love me? ~</i>

02:08:19.219 --> 02:08:21.295
I suppose I do.

02:08:23.765 --> 02:08:29.139
<i>~ And I suppose I love you, too ~</i>

02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:36.096
<i>~ It doesn't change a thing ~</i>

02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:40.479
<i>~ But even so ~</i>

02:08:40.583 --> 02:08:45.366
<i>~ After 25 years ~</i>

02:08:47.122 --> 02:08:55.876
<i>~ It's nice to know ~</i>

02:09:20.447 --> 02:09:22.736
Halt!

02:09:29.247 --> 02:09:32.987
There is no authority
above the will of the people.

02:09:33.092 --> 02:09:35.948
And we are the people.

02:09:36.052 --> 02:09:39.296
We are Russia!

02:09:41.259 --> 02:09:45.304
The time has come,
and the time is now.

02:09:46.348 --> 02:09:50.126
We stand here before you.
Not one, but many.

02:09:50.231 --> 02:09:52.425
Many like you.

02:09:52.529 --> 02:09:58.220
Students, workers
striving for a better life.

02:09:58.324 --> 02:10:03.979
And I urge you, fellow workers,
to band together with us.

02:10:04.083 --> 02:10:08.108
Join our movement, in the factories.

02:10:08.212 --> 02:10:10.862
In the schools.

02:10:10.966 --> 02:10:13.441
In the army.

02:10:13.546 --> 02:10:19.580
The winds of freedom
are beginning to blow all over Russia.

02:10:39.234 --> 02:10:41.310
Halt!

02:10:49.828 --> 02:10:52.366
Wait! Wait! Stand!

02:11:18.523 --> 02:11:20.599
Good day to you, Esther.

02:11:23.236 --> 02:11:26.266
Just a minute. Tzeitel. Tzeitel.

02:11:26.371 --> 02:11:29.023
- Good day, Yente.
- Tzeitel.

02:11:29.128 --> 02:11:34.067
I happened to stop in the post office
today, to say hello, see what's what.

02:11:34.171 --> 02:11:37.194
It doesn't cost anything to be friendly.

02:11:37.298 --> 02:11:39.445
So few people are like that.

02:11:39.549 --> 02:11:42.203
- Ni, ni.
- People.

02:11:42.307 --> 02:11:47.791
I tell you, if God lived on earth,
people would break his windows.

02:11:47.895 --> 02:11:51.210
- So you went to the post office.
- Yes, and the postman told me

02:11:51.314 --> 02:11:54.003
there was a letter for your sister Hodel.

02:11:54.108 --> 02:11:57.258
- Thanks, I'll go get it.
- I got it.

02:11:57.362 --> 02:11:59.756
It's from her intended - Perchik.

02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:04.557
Hodel will be so happy.
She's been waiting to hear from him...

02:12:04.661 --> 02:12:08.602
- But it's open.
- So it happened to be open.

02:12:35.058 --> 02:12:40.213
You don't have to wait for the
train, Papa. You'll be late for customers.

02:12:40.318 --> 02:12:42.345
It's all right.

02:12:42.449 --> 02:12:46.604
They'll just have to wait for a while.

02:12:55.178 --> 02:12:58.419
Is he in bad trouble,

02:12:58.523 --> 02:13:02.263
that hero of yours?

02:13:04.354 --> 02:13:06.430
Arrested?

02:13:08.525 --> 02:13:12.220
- Convicted?
- Yes. But he did nothing wrong.

02:13:12.324 --> 02:13:16.810
He cares nothing for himself.
Everything he does is for other people.

02:13:16.914 --> 02:13:21.315
Yes, but if he did nothing wrong,
he wouldn't be in trouble.

02:13:21.419 --> 02:13:24.859
Papa, how can you say that?

02:13:24.963 --> 02:13:30.325
What wrongs did Joseph do,
and Abraham, and Moses?

02:13:30.429 --> 02:13:32.536
And they had troubles.

02:13:32.641 --> 02:13:35.291
Yes, but...

02:13:35.395 --> 02:13:41.500
Why won't you tell me where he is now,

02:13:41.605 --> 02:13:45.174
this Joseph of yours?

02:13:45.278 --> 02:13:48.354
It is far, Papa.

02:13:49.566 --> 02:13:51.772
Terribly far.

02:13:54.696 --> 02:13:58.897
He is in a settlement in Siberia.

02:13:59.001 --> 02:14:01.068
Siberia?

02:14:02.454 --> 02:14:07.443
And he asks you
to leave your father and mother

02:14:07.547 --> 02:14:13.574
and join him in that frozen wasteland
and marry him there?

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:18.041
No, Papa.
He did not ask me to go.

02:14:18.145 --> 02:14:22.504
I want to go.
I don't want him to be alone.

02:14:22.608 --> 02:14:25.340
I want to help him in his work.

02:14:25.444 --> 02:14:29.130
- Hodel.
- Papa.

02:14:29.235 --> 02:14:33.682
<i>~ How can I hope</i>
<i>to make you understand? ~</i>

02:14:33.786 --> 02:14:39.144
<i>~ Why I do what I do ~</i>

02:14:39.248 --> 02:14:44.357
<i>~ Why I must travel to a distant land ~</i>

02:14:44.461 --> 02:14:48.831
<i>~ Far from the home I love ~</i>

02:14:49.542 --> 02:14:53.744

02:14:53.848 --> 02:14:59.077

02:14:59.181 --> 02:15:03.794
<i>~ Close to the people</i>

02:15:03.898 --> 02:15:09.590
<i>~ Here in the home I love ~</i>

02:15:09.694 --> 02:15:13.050
<i>~ Who could see that a man would come ~</i>

02:15:13.155 --> 02:15:17.972
<i>~ Who would change</i>

02:15:18.076 --> 02:15:23.854
<i>~ Helpless now I stand with him ~</i>

02:15:23.958 --> 02:15:32.904
<i>~ Watching older dreams grow dim ~</i>

02:15:33.008 --> 02:15:38.580
<i>~ Oh, what a melancholy choice this is ~</i>

02:15:38.684 --> 02:15:43.875
<i>~ Wanting home, wanting him ~</i>

02:15:43.979 --> 02:15:49.300
<i>~ Closing my heart to every hope but his ~</i>

02:15:49.404 --> 02:15:55.720
<i>~ Leaving the home I love ~</i>

02:15:55.824 --> 02:16:00.684
<i>~ There where my heart</i>

02:16:00.789 --> 02:16:02.856
<i>~ I must go ~</i>

02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:07.116
<i>~ I must go ~</i>

02:16:08.288 --> 02:16:14.071
<i>~ Who could imagine I'd be wandering so ~</i>

02:16:14.175 --> 02:16:19.240
<i>~ Far from the home I love ~</i>

02:16:19.345 --> 02:16:26.877
<i>~ Yet there with my love ~</i>

<i>~ I'm home ~</i>

02:16:52.749 --> 02:17:00.407
And who, my child, will there be
to perform a marriage in the wilderness?

02:17:00.512 --> 02:17:05.662
Papa, I promise you,
we will be married under a canopy.

02:17:05.766 --> 02:17:07.838
Yes. Yes.

02:17:11.058 --> 02:17:17.013
No doubt a rabbi or two
were also arrested.

02:18:01.259 --> 02:18:03.133
Papa!

02:18:04.262 --> 02:18:08.556
God alone knows
when we shall see each other again.

02:18:09.392 --> 02:18:14.468
Then we will leave it in his hands.

02:18:51.058 --> 02:18:53.977
Take care of her.

02:18:56.064 --> 02:19:00.358
See that she dresses warm.

02:19:15.416 --> 02:19:22.909
Even though she only burned his cooking,
he is permitted to divorce her.

02:19:23.013 --> 02:19:25.712
Just for supper?

02:19:26.761 --> 02:19:28.793
I'm sorry, Rabbi.

02:19:28.897 --> 02:19:32.213
Yes, of course.
What news of the outside world?

02:19:32.316 --> 02:19:34.878
- Terrible, Rabbi.
- Then don't tell me.

02:19:34.982 --> 02:19:39.355
If I want bad news,
I'll read about Noah and the flood.

02:19:41.401 --> 02:19:43.432
Tell me, Avram,

02:19:43.537 --> 02:19:47.728
surely somewhere
there are good things happening?

02:19:47.834 --> 02:19:51.648
Can't you buy a paper
that prints those things?

02:19:51.752 --> 02:19:54.820
It's not my fault, Rabbi. I only read it.

02:19:54.924 --> 02:19:57.151
Rabbi, did you hear the news?

02:19:57.255 --> 02:19:59.781
- More bad news?
- No, good news.

02:19:59.885 --> 02:20:02.786
At Motel's and Tzeitel's, a new arrival.

02:20:02.890 --> 02:20:06.131
A new arrival at Motel and Tzeitel's!

02:20:10.931 --> 02:20:14.044
We just heard the good news. Mazel tov.

02:20:14.148 --> 02:20:16.379
Thank you very much.

02:20:16.483 --> 02:20:18.342
It's a nice thing.

02:20:18.446 --> 02:20:20.424
Very nice.

02:20:20.529 --> 02:20:24.180
- What is it?
- It's a sewing machine.

02:20:24.285 --> 02:20:26.308
You can work twice as fast.

02:20:26.413 --> 02:20:30.145
- You got it.
- I got it.

02:20:30.249 --> 02:20:32.522
- It's beautiful.
- I know.

02:20:32.626 --> 02:20:36.149
- Have you tried it yet?
- Look.

02:20:36.253 --> 02:20:37.901
- Beautiful.
- I know.

02:20:38.006 --> 02:20:41.945
And in less than a minute.
See how close and even the stitches are.

02:20:42.049 --> 02:20:43.744
- It's beautiful.
- I know.

02:20:43.848 --> 02:20:46.952
From now on, my clothes will be perfect.

02:20:47.056 --> 02:20:51.379
Made by machine.
No more handmade clothes.

02:20:52.681 --> 02:20:55.635
- Look, Mama. Look.
- Oh.

02:20:56.852 --> 02:21:01.885
It's wonderful.
Mazel tov, Motel.

02:21:01.989 --> 02:21:04.899
- The rabbi. The rabbi.
- Shh. Shh.

02:21:08.196 --> 02:21:11.059
Rabbi, is there a blessing
for a sewing machine?

02:21:11.164 --> 02:21:15.155
There is a blessing for everything.

02:21:23.712 --> 02:21:28.163
That's your new arrival?
What is it, a boy or a girl?

02:21:28.267 --> 02:21:31.342
Well put. Well put.

02:21:32.387 --> 02:21:35.174
Yankela. Yankela.

02:21:37.225 --> 02:21:39.506
Why isn't he asleep?

02:21:39.610 --> 02:21:42.382
But he's wonderful.
He never cries or anything...

02:21:42.487 --> 02:21:45.927
Sha! Do you want to invite bad luck?

02:21:46.031 --> 02:21:48.556
Aaah! Well...

02:21:48.661 --> 02:21:50.934
Well, Motel.

02:21:51.038 --> 02:21:53.939
I never thought
you'd amount to anything.

02:21:54.043 --> 02:21:58.031
But look at you.
A baby and a sewing machine.

02:21:58.955 --> 02:22:01.236
You're a person.

02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:06.327
- Look, I'll show you how it works.
Go, children.

02:22:07.714 --> 02:22:09.867
First, you put the cloth in like this.

02:22:09.972 --> 02:22:14.675
It's an amazing thing.
You work it with your foot and your hand.

02:22:23.355 --> 02:22:25.264
Your father is coming.

02:22:28.401 --> 02:22:30.765
Chava, let me tell him about us.

02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:33.348
That would be the worst thing.

02:22:33.452 --> 02:22:35.518
- But let me try.
- No.

02:22:35.622 --> 02:22:39.235
I'll talk to him, I promise.

02:22:46.378 --> 02:22:49.408
Good afternoon, sir.

02:22:49.512 --> 02:22:52.127
Good afternoon.

02:22:55.136 --> 02:22:58.832
It's a cold day, isn't it?

02:22:58.936 --> 02:23:00.806
Mm.

02:23:03.770 --> 02:23:05.846
Well, uh...

02:23:07.399 --> 02:23:09.641
Good day, sir.

02:23:10.861 --> 02:23:13.980
- Good day, Chava.
- Good day.

02:23:19.619 --> 02:23:23.526
What were you and he talking about?

02:23:23.631 --> 02:23:26.743
Nothing. We were just talking.

02:23:28.044 --> 02:23:30.120
Good.

02:23:31.756 --> 02:23:33.630
Papa.

02:23:34.676 --> 02:23:38.710
Fyedka and I, we've known each other
for a long time now, and...

02:23:38.815 --> 02:23:40.875
Chaveleh,

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:47.173
I would be much happier if
you would remain friends from a distance.

02:23:47.277 --> 02:23:54.181
You must not forget
who you are and who that man is.

02:23:54.285 --> 02:23:56.765
- He has a name, Papa.
- Of course.

02:23:56.869 --> 02:23:59.645
All creatures on earth have a name.

02:23:59.749 --> 02:24:03.067
Fyedka is not a creature.
Fyedka is a man.

02:24:03.171 --> 02:24:05.860
Who says he isn't?

02:24:05.965 --> 02:24:11.112
It's just that he's a different kind of man.

02:24:11.217 --> 02:24:13.199
As the Good Book says,

02:24:13.303 --> 02:24:16.661
"Each shall seek his own kind."

02:24:16.765 --> 02:24:21.128
In other words, a bird may love a fish,

02:24:21.232 --> 02:24:25.552
but where would they
build a home together?

02:24:28.438 --> 02:24:32.889
- The world is changing.
- No, Chaveleh.

02:24:32.994 --> 02:24:34.599
No.

02:24:34.704 --> 02:24:38.185
Some things do not change for us.

02:24:38.290 --> 02:24:40.523
Some things will never change.

02:24:42.369 --> 02:24:44.657
We don't feel that way.

02:24:46.581 --> 02:24:48.657
We?

02:24:49.292 --> 02:24:52.905
Fyedka and I.
We want to be married.

02:24:53.010 --> 02:24:57.205
What? Are you out of your mind?

02:24:57.310 --> 02:24:59.165
What?

02:24:59.269 --> 02:25:03.961
Don't you understand what that means,
marrying outside of the faith?

02:25:04.065 --> 02:25:07.752
- But, Papa.
- No! I said no!

02:25:07.857 --> 02:25:10.716
Never talk about it again.

02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:15.053
Never mention his name again.
Never see him again.

02:25:15.158 --> 02:25:17.810
Never.

02:25:17.915 --> 02:25:20.395
Do you understand me?

02:25:22.534 --> 02:25:24.610
Yes, Papa.

02:25:25.829 --> 02:25:28.664
I understand you.

02:25:35.172 --> 02:25:38.202
You're finally here.
It's late for supper.

02:25:38.306 --> 02:25:42.456
- I want to see Motel's new machine.
- You'll see it another time.

02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:48.131
Quiet, woman, because when
I get angry, even flies don't dare to fly!

02:25:48.236 --> 02:25:52.882
I'm very frightened of you.
After we finish supper, I'll faint.

02:25:52.986 --> 02:25:57.304
Golde, I am the man in the house.

02:25:57.408 --> 02:25:59.722
I am the head of the family.

02:25:59.826 --> 02:26:05.195
And I want to see
Motel's new machine now!

02:26:10.123 --> 02:26:12.910
Now let's go home.

02:27:41.381 --> 02:27:44.916
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

02:27:45.677 --> 02:27:48.502
May I see His Honour, the priest?

02:27:48.606 --> 02:27:50.666
- The Reverend Father?
- Yes.

02:27:50.771 --> 02:27:53.380
Why do you want to see him?

02:27:53.484 --> 02:27:57.688
It's a family matter. A personal matter.

02:27:59.357 --> 02:28:02.682
- My daughter.
- Yes? What about your daughter?

02:28:02.786 --> 02:28:06.307
Please, if I could speak with the p...

02:28:06.411 --> 02:28:10.562
If I could speak
with the Reverend Father.

02:28:10.667 --> 02:28:12.736
Please?

02:28:13.914 --> 02:28:15.990
Wait here.

02:28:52.118 --> 02:28:53.992
Tevye!

02:28:56.706 --> 02:28:58.580
Tevye!

02:29:05.632 --> 02:29:07.663
What is it?

02:29:07.767 --> 02:29:09.829
It's Chava.

02:29:09.933 --> 02:29:13.874
She left home this morning with Fyedka.

02:29:13.978 --> 02:29:17.752
- What?
- I looked everywhere for her.

02:29:17.857 --> 02:29:20.308
I even went to the priest.

02:29:23.984 --> 02:29:27.103
He told me they were married.

02:29:31.283 --> 02:29:32.898
Married?

02:29:33.002 --> 02:29:34.985
Yes.

02:29:38.748 --> 02:29:40.658
Well...

02:29:41.459 --> 02:29:44.164
Go home, Golde.

02:29:45.630 --> 02:29:48.577
We have other children at home.

02:29:48.681 --> 02:29:51.916
You have work to do, I have work to do.

02:29:52.020 --> 02:29:54.419
- Go home.
- But Chaveleh...

02:29:55.098 --> 02:29:58.265
Chava is dead to us.

02:30:00.896 --> 02:30:03.600
We'll forget her.

02:30:04.524 --> 02:30:06.600
Go home.

02:30:07.527 --> 02:30:10.647
Go home, Golde.

02:30:30.217 --> 02:30:32.624
Oh...

02:30:46.316 --> 02:30:52.189
<i>~ Little bird, little Chaveleh ~</i>

02:30:52.322 --> 02:30:56.017
<i>~ I don't understand</i>
<i>what's happening today ~</i>

02:30:56.122 --> 02:31:01.151
<i>~ Everything is all a blur ~</i>

02:31:01.255 --> 02:31:04.822
<i>~ All I can see is a happy child ~</i>

02:31:04.926 --> 02:31:09.286
<i>~ The sweet little bird you were, Chaveleh ~</i>

02:31:09.390 --> 02:31:11.457
<i>~ Chaveleh ~</i>

02:31:15.971 --> 02:31:22.131
<i>~ Little bird, little Chaveleh ~</i>

02:31:22.235 --> 02:31:26.051
<i>~ You were always</i>
<i>such a pretty little thing ~</i>

02:31:26.155 --> 02:31:30.359
<i>~ Everybody's favourite child ~</i>

02:31:34.447 --> 02:31:38.060
<i>~ Gentle and kind and affectionate ~</i>

02:31:38.165 --> 02:31:42.444
<i>~ What a sweet little bird</i>
<i>you were, Chaveleh ~</i>

02:31:42.548 --> 02:31:44.615
<i>~ Chaveleh ~</i>

02:33:13.797 --> 02:33:15.873
Papa.

02:33:17.342 --> 02:33:19.418
Papa!

02:33:22.097 --> 02:33:25.382
Papa, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

02:33:46.329 --> 02:33:48.405
Papa, stop!

02:33:51.126 --> 02:33:54.246
At least listen to me.

02:33:55.088 --> 02:33:57.491
Papa...

02:33:57.595 --> 02:34:01.339
I beg you to accept us.

02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:09.789
Accept them?

02:34:10.837 --> 02:34:13.542
How can I accept them?

02:34:14.882 --> 02:34:18.880
Can I deny everything I believe in?

02:34:20.179 --> 02:34:23.004
On the other hand,

02:34:23.108 --> 02:34:26.717
can I deny my own daughter?

02:34:32.108 --> 02:34:35.554
On the other hand,

02:34:35.658 --> 02:34:39.560
how can I turn my back on my faith,

02:34:39.665 --> 02:34:42.575
my people?

02:34:43.786 --> 02:34:48.858
If I try and bend that far,

02:34:48.962 --> 02:34:51.663
I'll break.

02:34:54.088 --> 02:34:57.208
On the other hand...

02:35:01.220 --> 02:35:06.725
No, there is no other hand.

02:35:07.226 --> 02:35:10.257
- No, Chava! No!
- But, Papa!

02:35:10.361 --> 02:35:13.272
- No! No!
- Papa!

02:35:15.818 --> 02:35:17.894
Papa!

02:35:36.422 --> 02:35:40.035
Golde, here they are.

02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:44.957
The boys I told you about.
Wonderful boys from good families.

02:35:45.061 --> 02:35:49.424
Each of them a prize, a jewel.
You couldn't do better for your girls.

02:35:49.528 --> 02:35:53.426
I don't know, Yente.
My girls are still so young.

02:35:53.530 --> 02:35:56.092
So what do they look like, grandfathers?

02:35:56.196 --> 02:35:58.429
True, the marriage can wait,

02:35:58.533 --> 02:36:03.100
but meanwhile, their future
will be all signed and sealed.

02:36:03.204 --> 02:36:05.519
Which one for which one?

02:36:05.623 --> 02:36:09.525
What's the difference? Take your pick.
They're both wonderful boys.

02:36:09.630 --> 02:36:14.655
Yankel, the fat one,
is apprenticed to a carpenter.

02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:17.532
- I am Yankel.
- Did I ask you?

02:36:17.636 --> 02:36:20.289
Yankel, the skinny one, is...

02:36:20.393 --> 02:36:25.372
- Mama, is Reb Tevye in the house?
- He's in the barn. Is there trouble?

02:36:25.477 --> 02:36:27.678
Stay inside, children.

02:36:29.726 --> 02:36:31.546
What's the matter?

02:36:31.650 --> 02:36:35.257
Tevye, have you seen
the constable lately?

02:36:35.361 --> 02:36:39.302
- No. Why?
- There are some rumours in town.

02:36:39.406 --> 02:36:42.349
We thought, since you knew him so well,

02:36:42.453 --> 02:36:45.522
maybe he told you
what is true and what is not.

02:36:45.626 --> 02:36:48.608
Rumours? What rumours?

02:36:48.712 --> 02:36:51.317
Quiet! Talk, Avram.

02:36:51.421 --> 02:36:56.409
Someone from Zolodin told me
an edict issued in St Petersburg...

02:37:05.011 --> 02:37:09.628
Welcome, Your Honour.
What's the good news in the world?

02:37:09.732 --> 02:37:13.003
I see that you have company.

02:37:13.108 --> 02:37:15.422
They are my friends.

02:37:15.527 --> 02:37:19.815
It's just as well.
What I have to say is for their ears also.

02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:26.144
How much time do you need
to sell your house and household goods?

02:37:26.248 --> 02:37:30.980
Why should I sell my house?
Is it in anybody's way?

02:37:31.084 --> 02:37:34.080
I came to tell you
you have to leave Anatevka.

02:37:35.667 --> 02:37:39.029
How did I come
to deserve such an honour?

02:37:39.134 --> 02:37:41.880
Not just you, of course, but all of you.

02:37:50.014 --> 02:37:54.466
At first, I thought you might be spared
because of your daughter's marriage.

02:37:54.570 --> 02:37:57.840
My daughter is dead.

02:37:57.944 --> 02:38:00.015
I understand.

02:38:01.234 --> 02:38:05.518
At any rate, it affects all of you.
You have to leave.

02:38:05.623 --> 02:38:13.028
But this corner of the world
has always been our home.

02:38:14.205 --> 02:38:17.113
- Why should we leave?
- I don't know why.

02:38:17.218 --> 02:38:21.242
There's trouble in the world.
Troublemakers.

02:38:21.347 --> 02:38:24.451
- Like us?
- You aren't the only ones.

02:38:24.555 --> 02:38:27.706
Your people must leave all
the villages - Zolodin, Rabalevka.

02:38:27.810 --> 02:38:30.922
The entire district must be emptied.

02:38:31.431 --> 02:38:34.550
I have an order here!

02:38:36.185 --> 02:38:40.230
It says that you must sell your homes
and be out of here in three days.

02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:54.230
And you?

02:38:54.334 --> 02:38:59.861
You, who have known us all your life,
you'd carry out this order?

02:38:59.965 --> 02:39:02.618
I've nothing to do with it.
Don't you understand?

02:39:02.722 --> 02:39:06.574
I wish you wouldn't say me.

02:39:06.678 --> 02:39:10.830
- I understand.
- Suppose we refuse to go?

02:39:10.935 --> 02:39:14.291
- You will be forced out.
- We will defend ourselves.

02:39:14.396 --> 02:39:18.547
- We'll stay in our homes.
- We will keep our land and fight.

02:39:18.651 --> 02:39:22.301
Against our militia, our army?
I wouldn't advise that.

02:39:22.406 --> 02:39:25.850
I have some advice for you.

02:39:27.028 --> 02:39:29.891
Get off my land.

02:39:29.995 --> 02:39:35.228
This is still my home, my land.

02:39:35.332 --> 02:39:38.448
Get off my land.

02:39:46.881 --> 02:39:50.001
You have three days.

02:40:00.812 --> 02:40:03.010
After a lifetime,

02:40:03.114 --> 02:40:06.097
a piece of paper, and get thee out.

02:40:06.201 --> 02:40:08.851
We should unite
with the people of Zolodin.

02:40:08.955 --> 02:40:12.142
- Maybe they have a plan.
- We should defend ourselves.

02:40:12.246 --> 02:40:15.853
- An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
- Very good

02:40:15.957 --> 02:40:19.398
That way the whole world
will be blind and toothless.

02:40:19.502 --> 02:40:25.574
Rabbi, we've been waiting
for the Messiah all our lives.

02:40:25.678 --> 02:40:28.505
Wouldn't this be
a good time for him to come?

02:40:32.385 --> 02:40:37.177
We'll have to wait for him someplace else.

02:40:41.394 --> 02:40:45.344
Meanwhile, let's start packing.

02:41:04.208 --> 02:41:09.908
Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly been
the Garden of Eden.

02:41:10.012 --> 02:41:11.870
That's true.

02:41:11.975 --> 02:41:15.329
After all, what have we got here?

02:41:15.433 --> 02:41:20.334
<i>~ A little bit of this, a little bit of that ~</i>

02:41:20.438 --> 02:41:22.835
<i>~ A pot</i>
<i>A pan ~</i>

02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:25.966
<i>~ A broom</i>
<i>A hat ~</i>

02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:31.641
<i>~ Someone should have set a match</i>
<i>to this place years ago ~</i>

02:41:31.745 --> 02:41:33.767
<i>~ A bench</i>
<i>A tree ~</i>

02:41:33.871 --> 02:41:36.643
<i>~ What's a house?</i>
<i>Or a stove? ~</i>

02:41:36.747 --> 02:41:41.774
People who pass through Anatevka
don't even know they've been here.

02:41:41.878 --> 02:41:46.405
<i>~ A stick of wood</i>
<i>A piece of cloth ~</i>

02:41:46.509 --> 02:41:48.903
<i>~ What do we leave? ~</i>

02:41:49.007 --> 02:41:51.494
<i>~ Nothing much ~</i>

02:41:51.714 --> 02:41:54.964
<i>~ Only Anatevka ~</i>

02:41:57.679 --> 02:42:00.081
<i>~ Anatevka ~</i>

02:42:00.185 --> 02:42:02.583
<i>~ Anatevka ~</i>

02:42:02.688 --> 02:42:08.383
<i>~ Underfed, overworked Anatevka ~</i>

02:42:08.487 --> 02:42:15.480
<i>~ Where else would Sabbath be so sweet? ~</i>

02:42:18.283 --> 02:42:20.730
<i>~ Anatevka ~</i>

02:42:20.834 --> 02:42:23.107
<i>~ Anatevka ~</i>

02:42:23.211 --> 02:42:28.653
<i>~ Intimate, obstinate Anatevka ~</i>

02:42:28.758 --> 02:42:35.501
<i>~ Where I know everyone I meet ~</i>

02:42:38.219 --> 02:42:48.258
<i>~ Soon I'll be a stranger</i>
<i>in a strange new place ~</i>

02:42:48.363 --> 02:42:55.430
<i>~ Searching for an old familiar face ~</i>

02:42:55.534 --> 02:42:59.692
<i>~ From Anatevka ~</i>

02:43:20.553 --> 02:43:25.420
<i>~ I belong to Anatevka ~</i>

02:43:25.525 --> 02:43:31.094
<i>~ Tumbledown, workaday Anatevka ~</i>

02:43:31.198 --> 02:43:34.430
<i>~ Dear little village ~</i>

02:43:34.534 --> 02:43:44.407
<i>~ Little town of mine ~</i>

02:44:04.138 --> 02:44:06.170
It's just a place.

02:44:06.274 --> 02:44:12.381
Our forefathers have been forced out of
many, many places at a moment's notice.

02:44:12.485 --> 02:44:18.601
Maybe that's why
we always wear our hats.

02:46:10.848 --> 02:46:12.502
Golde!

02:46:12.606 --> 02:46:14.254
Golde, darling.

02:46:14.358 --> 02:46:18.636
I had to see you before I left
because I have such news for you.

02:46:18.741 --> 02:46:24.476
Remember, yesterday I didn't know where
to go, what to do with these old bones.

02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:27.767
Now I know.
You want to hear? I'll tell you.

02:46:27.872 --> 02:46:31.644
All my life,
I've dreamed of going to one place.

02:46:31.748 --> 02:46:34.691
Guess where?
Nah, you'll never guess.

02:46:34.795 --> 02:46:38.113
Every year at Passover, what do we say?

02:46:38.217 --> 02:46:43.242
Next year in Jerusalem.
Next year in the Holy Land.

02:46:43.347 --> 02:46:46.869
- You're going to the Holy Land?
- You guessed.

02:46:46.973 --> 02:46:49.332
Goodbye, Yente.

02:46:49.436 --> 02:46:54.046
Be well and go in peace.

02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:56.128
And so, goodbye, Golde.

02:46:56.232 --> 02:46:59.923
Sometime, maybe we'll meet
on a happier occasion.

02:47:00.027 --> 02:47:03.263
Meanwhile, we suffer. Oh, we suffer.

02:47:03.368 --> 02:47:06.850
We suffer in silence, right?
Of course, right.

02:47:06.955 --> 02:47:11.896
Where are you going?
You don't know where you're going?

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:16.777
- Come, Golde, we have to leave.
- Leave. It sounds so easy.

02:47:16.881 --> 02:47:20.568
Golde, we'll all be together soon.

02:47:20.672 --> 02:47:23.782
Motel, Tzeitel and the baby,
they'll come too, you'll see.

02:47:23.886 --> 02:47:25.950
This Motel is a person.

02:47:26.054 --> 02:47:29.705
And Hodel and Perchik?
When will we ever see them again?

02:47:29.810 --> 02:47:33.377
Do they come visiting us
from Siberia every Sabbath?

02:47:33.481 --> 02:47:38.840
You know what she writes.
He sits in prison, she works.

02:47:38.944 --> 02:47:45.219
But soon he'll be set free and together
they'll turn the world upside down.

02:47:45.323 --> 02:47:50.979
She couldn't be happier,
and the other children will be with us.

02:47:51.083 --> 02:47:53.150
Not all.

02:47:54.494 --> 02:47:56.570
All.

02:48:02.293 --> 02:48:04.158
Come, Golde.

02:48:04.262 --> 02:48:07.744
I have to clean up, sweep the floor.

02:48:07.849 --> 02:48:12.549
- Sweep the floor?
- I don't want to leave a dirty house.

02:48:16.474 --> 02:48:18.348
Tevye.

02:48:19.936 --> 02:48:24.426
Tevye, I am on my way.

02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:27.229
Where are you going?

02:48:28.278 --> 02:48:30.763
Chicago, in America.

02:48:30.868 --> 02:48:33.227
Chicago, America?

02:48:33.332 --> 02:48:36.648
We are going to New York, America.

02:48:36.753 --> 02:48:39.108
We'll be neighbours.

02:48:39.212 --> 02:48:42.113
My wife, Fruma Sarah,
has a brother there.

02:48:42.218 --> 02:48:45.821
- That's nice.
- I hate him!

02:48:45.925 --> 02:48:51.259
But a relative is a relative.

02:48:52.719 --> 02:48:55.838
- Goodbye, Tevye.
- Goodbye, Lazar Wolf.

02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:03.763
Well, my old friends,
it's time to say goodbye.

02:50:10.152 --> 02:50:13.106
The farmer Bushenko
will be coming for you later.

02:50:14.365 --> 02:50:16.690
He's not a bad sort.

02:50:17.826 --> 02:50:22.120
If you are good to him,
he'll be good to you.

02:50:24.541 --> 02:50:28.160
Take care of your leg, huh?

02:50:38.847 --> 02:50:41.219
Thanks for everything.

02:50:56.782 --> 02:50:58.858
Chava!

02:51:04.748 --> 02:51:06.901
- Papa will see you.
- I want him to.

02:51:07.006 --> 02:51:10.824
I want to say goodbye to him.

02:51:10.928 --> 02:51:13.996
- He won't listen to you.
- But at least he will hear.

02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:17.376
Maybe it would be better if I told Mama.

02:51:19.430 --> 02:51:21.506
Chaveleh!

02:51:37.573 --> 02:51:39.649
Papa.

02:51:54.339 --> 02:51:56.416
Papa.

02:51:58.969 --> 02:52:01.092
We came to say goodbye.

02:52:06.393 --> 02:52:09.596
We are also leaving this place.

02:52:10.939 --> 02:52:13.009
We are going to Cracow.

02:52:13.113 --> 02:52:19.063
We cannot stay among people
who can do such things to others.

02:52:20.908 --> 02:52:24.490
We wanted you to know that.

02:52:36.632 --> 02:52:39.911
Some are driven away by edicts,

02:52:40.015 --> 02:52:42.964
others by silence.

02:52:52.689 --> 02:52:55.394
Goodbye, Papa.

02:52:57.027 --> 02:52:59.103
Mama.

02:53:02.074 --> 02:53:04.150
Come, Chava.

02:53:20.217 --> 02:53:22.625
Goodbye, Chava... Fyedka.

02:53:27.307 --> 02:53:29.715
And God be with you.

02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:42.682
- And God be with you.
- We will write to you in America.

02:53:42.786 --> 02:53:45.479
We will be staying with Uncle Avram!

02:53:45.583 --> 02:53:47.652
Yes, Mama.

02:53:58.063 --> 02:54:02.470
"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?"
"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?"

02:54:02.574 --> 02:54:05.808
The whole world
has to know our business.

02:54:05.913 --> 02:54:11.021
Stop yelling and finish packing.
We have a long way to go.

02:54:11.125 --> 02:54:14.647
Golde, I don't need your advice.

02:54:14.752 --> 02:54:17.866
Tzeitel, don't forget the baby.

02:54:35.267 --> 02:54:37.343
Goodbye, Papa.

02:54:46.278 --> 02:54:48.937
Work hard, Motel,

02:54:49.041 --> 02:54:51.939
and come to us soon.

02:54:52.043 --> 02:54:54.441
I will, Papa.

02:54:55.579 --> 02:54:58.450
I'll work hard.

02:55:34.451 --> 02:55:36.527
All right, children.

02:55:39.206 --> 02:55:41.282
Let's go.

03:00:51.977 --> 03:00:55.761
