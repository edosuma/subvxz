<i>We'll follow as soon
as we blow those doors.</i>

18:32.373 --> 18:33.601
<i>MISS MARTIAN:
Don't...</i>

18:33.774 --> 18:35.935
<i>Don't tell me the mission
was a success.</i>

18:36.110 --> 18:38.544
<i>The price was too high.</i>

18:47.488 --> 18:50.218
<i>No, no, no.</i>

18:50.391 --> 18:54.760
<i>- We have to get out of here now.
J'ONN J'ONZZ: No. We have to end this now.</i>

[ALL GROANING]

19:07.641 --> 19:10.804
- You're all alive.
- What happened in there?

19:10.978 --> 19:14.470
The exercise, it all went wrong.

19:14.648 --> 19:18.607
- Exercise?
- Try to remember.

19:18.786 --> 19:22.449
<i>What you experienced
was a training exercise.</i>

19:22.623 --> 19:26.423
<i>Manhunter psychically linked the six of you
within an artificial reality.</i>

19:26.593 --> 19:28.356
<i>You all knew this going in.</i>

19:28.529 --> 19:32.124
<i>What you didn't know was that
it was a train-for-failure exercise.</i>

19:32.299 --> 19:36.463
<i>No matter what the Team accomplished,
the scenario was designed to grow worse.</i>

19:36.637 --> 19:39.367
<i>Still you were aware nothing was real...</i>

19:39.540 --> 19:42.532
<i>...including the deaths
of the entire Justice League.</i>

19:42.709 --> 19:44.643
That is why you hardly grieved.

19:44.812 --> 19:48.043
Even when Wolf was disintegrated
before your eyes.

19:48.415 --> 19:52.784
But all that changed when Artemis died.

19:54.388 --> 19:57.414
<i>Though consciously Miss Martian
knew it was not real...</i>

19:57.591 --> 20:00.958
<i>...her subconscious mind
could not make that distinction.</i>

20:01.128 --> 20:03.528
<i>- She forgot it was only an exercise.
- Artemis!</i>

20:04.231 --> 20:10.033
And her subconscious took control,
making all of you forget too.

20:11.171 --> 20:12.195
Uh, I'm...

20:12.372 --> 20:13.839
I'm so sorry.

20:14.007 --> 20:16.874
This isn't her fault.
Why didn't you stop the exercise?

20:17.044 --> 20:22.380
We tried. But M'gann had a death grip
on the scenario.

20:22.549 --> 20:25.245
<i>Even Artemis, who should
have awakened upon her death...</i>

20:25.419 --> 20:29.480
<i>...was so convinced she had passed,
she slipped into a coma.</i>

20:29.656 --> 20:33.148
<i>I realized I would have to wrest control
from Miss Martian's subconscious...</i>

20:33.327 --> 20:34.589
<i>...from within.</i>

20:34.761 --> 20:36.854
<i>But upon entering the reality...</i>

20:37.030 --> 20:40.193
<i>...I was overwhelmed
by your collective emotion.</i>

20:40.367 --> 20:44.963
<i>There was too much noise
to think clearly...</i>

20:45.138 --> 20:47.663
<i>...to remember why I was there.</i>

20:48.542 --> 20:52.205
<i>The deaths of Aqualad
and Superboy helped.</i>

20:52.713 --> 20:57.446
<i>But only when the mothership exploded,
and Robin and Kid Flash were silenced...</i>

20:57.618 --> 21:01.315
<i>...did my mind clear enough
to remember my true purpose.</i>

21:01.488 --> 21:06.926
<i>To shock M'gann out of the exercise
before your comas became permanent.</i>

21:07.094 --> 21:13.431
My apologies. I had no idea
a training exercise could be so dangerous.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.034
So damaging.

21:20.574 --> 21:23.702
- As bad as all that?
- Perhaps worse.

RED TORNADO:
Yet this is not what troubles you.

21:26.113 --> 21:27.808
Make no mistake.

21:27.981 --> 21:31.917
My niece is untrained
and cannot be held responsible for this...

21:32.085 --> 21:35.248
- For our debacle.
- No one blames her.

21:35.422 --> 21:37.617
But clearly we underestimated
her abilities.

21:37.791 --> 21:39.554
You understate it.
