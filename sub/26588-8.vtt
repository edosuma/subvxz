love this movie,

16:44.330 --> 16:47.710
I would be saying the message
behind it wasn't important,

16:47.710 --> 16:49.920
and all of our messages
are important.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.040
And other people need
to hear them, too.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.540
You are right.
They do.

16:53.540 --> 16:56.330
But you have to admit, Dre,
if the movie's bad,

16:56.330 --> 16:58.750
the message is gonna
get lost anyway.

16:58.750 --> 16:59.960
[ Sighs ]

16:59.960 --> 17:02.000
Let's go light the tree.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.670
Come on, now.
Hot mess.

17:03.670 --> 17:05.170
Pops:
Cookie, cookie, cookie.

17:05.170 --> 17:07.670
Mama's sorry, baby.
Mama's sorry.

17:07.670 --> 17:08.830
Mama's sorry.

17:08.830 --> 17:10.620
Hey.

17:10.620 --> 17:11.830
Hey.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.170
You doing okay?
Yeah.

17:13.170 --> 17:15.420
Yeah? 'Cause, you know,
you mentioned that thing

17:15.420 --> 17:17.210
about finding yourself
at the movie theater.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.750
Was that about
the gap year?

17:18.750 --> 17:21.210
Yeah, but I've got it
under control.
Ooh.

17:21.210 --> 17:23.880
I'm gonna go to Australia
for a walkabout.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.420
A walkabout?

17:25.420 --> 17:27.580
[ Australian accent ] Yeah,
mate. It's gonna be official.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.420
[ Normal voice ] You know,
Tilley hat, shorts,

17:29.420 --> 17:32.880
boots, Bowie knife,
sunscreen.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.960
All I need from you is
a Tilley hat, shorts,

17:35.960 --> 17:37.210
boots, Bowie knife,

17:37.210 --> 17:40.420
and $7,500.

17:40.420 --> 17:41.830
I've already got
the sunscreen.

17:41.830 --> 17:43.710
That's all you need?
Mm-hmm.

17:43.710 --> 17:46.120
For your walkabout
in Australia.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.120
Yep.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.620
Are you [bleep]
kidding me?

17:51.620 --> 17:54.380
Wait. W-Where'd this
come from?

17:54.380 --> 17:57.000
I thought you'd be happy
that I have a plan.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.290
That's not a plan, Junior.

17:59.290 --> 18:02.250
That's a prize you win
on "The Price is Right."

18:02.250 --> 18:04.670
Oh, my God.

18:04.670 --> 18:07.120
I haven't been on you
the way your dad has been

18:07.120 --> 18:09.580
because I figured
that you would have

18:09.580 --> 18:11.460
sorted this out by now.

18:11.460 --> 18:13.420
But I'm gonna ask you --

18:13.420 --> 18:15.080
what is your gap year for?

18:17.670 --> 18:21.170
I-I don't know, to decide what
I want to do with my life?

18:21.170 --> 18:23.210
Then you need to do that.

18:23.210 --> 18:24.290
You got to take inventory.

18:24.290 --> 18:26.330
It's not gonna fall
in your lap, okay?

18:26.330 --> 18:28.080
You got to make
some decisions.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.120
Yeah. Okay, I'll try.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.120
No, you're not gonna try.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.920
I will find my purpose.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.330
That's exactly right.

18:36.330 --> 18:37.920
It's your last shot,
Junior.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.250
Last strike, okay?

18:42.500 --> 18:45.460
[ Sighs ]

18:45.460 --> 18:46.750
Oh...

18:48.420 --> 18:51.120
So, "Back of the Bus"
was a dud,

18:51.120 --> 18:52.830
but our stories aren't.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.500
Rosa Parks' story isn't.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.460
Then it hit me.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.080
All right!
Come on, get up!

19:00.080 --> 19:02.210
Everybody get up!
Let's go!

19:05.080 --> 19:06.250
[ Knocking on door ]

19:06.250 --> 19:07.580
Come on, let's go.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.250
Everybody downstairs.
Let's go.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.120
[ Sighs ]
This better be good.

19:16.290 --> 19:18.170
-[ Sighs ]
-All right.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.960
Dad, why are we up
so early?

19:19.960 --> 19:22.250
Yeah, wasn't Christmas
yesterday?

19:22.250 --> 19:23.790
[ Gasps ] Are we having
two Christmases

19:23.790 --> 19:24.710
like my friend Payton?

19:24.710 --> 19:26.380
No. Sit down.

19:26.380 --> 19:27.920
No?

19:27.920 --> 19:31.120
All right, we are going to
start a new tradition.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.120
Moving forward,
the day after Christmas,

19:34.120 --> 19:37.540
we will all gather together
and watch a classic Black movie,

19:37.540 --> 19:40.170
because what we have to say
is important.

19:40.170 --> 19:41.330
-I like that.
-Hey.

19:41.330 --> 19:42.120
-All right?
-That's nice.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.540
Now, what do you guys
want to see?

19:43.540 --> 19:45.880
Um...
"Get Out"?

19:45.880 --> 19:46.920
"Fruitvale Station"?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.120
-Oh.
-Unh.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.250
"Cooley High." No.
"The Color Purple."

Oh! Uh -- Uh,
"Barbershop 2."

19:52.380 --> 19:54.380
Unh-huh.
Uh, "Cornbread,

"Man on Fire."

20:02.710 --> 20:03.960
Mama...
Huh?

20:03.960 --> 20:06.330
Those are all Denzel Washington,
movies, okay?

20:06.330 --> 20:07.960
I don't think you're
getting the point.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.380
Oh, I'm getting the point.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.790
Well, if we're gonna
watch a Denzel movie,

20:11.790 --> 20:14.420
let's at least start
with "The Hurricane."

20:14.420 --> 20:16.040
-Ooh, yes!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Oh, yeah.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.330
It's about the wrongful
imprisonment of a Black man.

20:18.330 --> 20:20.920
No, the wrongful imprisonment
of his thighs

20:20.920 --> 20:22.290
in those boxing shorts.

20:22.290 --> 20:24.380
You see,
when I saw the movie...
Mama...

20:24.380 --> 20:25.540

in the thea-- Huh?

Mama, my babies.
