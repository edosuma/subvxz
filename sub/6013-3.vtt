WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:05.137
MOST MEN LIKE
WORKING ON THINGS--

00:05.171 --> 00:06.939
TOOLS, OBJECTS,
FIXING THINGS--

00:06.973 --> 00:08.774
THIS IS WHAT MEN ENJOY.

00:08.808 --> 00:11.610
NOTICE WHEN A GUY'S
OUT IN HIS DRIVEWAY,

00:11.644 --> 00:12.945
WORKING WITH TOOLS,

00:12.979 --> 00:14.813
ALL MEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

00:14.848 --> 00:17.182
ARE MAGNETICALLY DRAWN
TO THIS ACTIVITY?

00:17.217 --> 00:20.419
THEY COME WANDERING OUT
OF THE HOUSE LIKE ZOMBIES.

00:21.688 --> 00:25.124
MEN HEAR A DRILL,
IT'S LIKE A DOG WHISTLE--

00:25.158 --> 00:26.258
JUST...

00:27.861 --> 00:30.829
THEY GO RUNNING TO
THAT LIVING ROOM CURTAIN--

00:30.864 --> 00:34.033
"HONEY, JIM'S WORKING
ON SOMETHING OVER THERE."

00:34.067 --> 00:35.567
SO THEY RUN OVER.

00:35.602 --> 00:38.837
NOW, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY
HELP THE GUY. NO.

00:38.872 --> 00:42.808
THEY JUST WANT
TO HANG AROUND THE AREA

00:42.842 --> 00:45.944
WHERE WORK IS BEING DONE.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.815
THAT'S WHAT MEN
WANT TO DO.

00:49.849 --> 00:51.850
WE WANT TO WATCH THE GUY.

00:51.885 --> 00:56.255
WE WANT TO TALK TO HIM,
ASK HIM DUMB QUESTIONS--

00:56.289 --> 00:59.291
"WHAT ARE YOU USING,
A PHILLIPS HEAD THERE?"

01:01.294 --> 01:03.796
YOU KNOW, WE FEEL INVOLVED.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.798
THAT'S WHY,
AT CONSTRUCTION SITES,

01:05.832 --> 01:08.300
THEY NEED THOSE FENCES
AROUND IT.

01:08.334 --> 01:11.270
THAT'S JUST
TO KEEP THE MEN OUT.

01:11.304 --> 01:13.305
THEY CUT HOLES FOR US

01:13.339 --> 01:16.141
SO WE CAN SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:16.176 --> 01:17.976
UNLESS THEY CUT
THOSE HOLES,

01:18.011 --> 01:19.778
WE ARE CLIMBING
THOSE FENCES.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.146
RIGHT OVER THERE.

01:21.181 --> 01:24.616
WHAT ARE YOU USING,
THE STEEL GIRDERS DOWN HERE?

01:24.651 --> 01:26.585
YEAH, THAT'LL HOLD.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.542
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
COLUMBIA TRISTAR
DOMESTIC TELEVISION

01:38.454 --> 01:39.721
I HAD TO SAY
SOMETHING.

01:39.755 --> 01:42.123
HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

01:42.158 --> 01:44.125
EVERYTHING
WAS GOING SO WELL.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.827
I HAD TO SAY
SOMETHING.

01:45.861 --> 01:47.796
YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.

01:47.830 --> 01:50.131
I TOLD HER
I LIKED HER.

01:50.166 --> 01:52.300
WHY DID I TELL
HER I LIKE HER?

01:52.335 --> 01:53.835
I HAVE
THIS COMPULSION

01:53.869 --> 01:56.338
TO TELL WOMEN
HOW I FEEL.

01:56.372 --> 01:58.640
I LIKE YOU. I
DON'T TELL YOU.

01:58.674 --> 02:01.409
WE CAN ONLY
THANK GOD FOR THAT.

02:01.444 --> 02:03.378
I'M OUT
OF THE PICTURE.

02:03.412 --> 02:04.913
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

02:04.947 --> 02:07.415
HA HA!
MATTER OF TIME NOW.

02:07.450 --> 02:08.917
YOU'RE IMAGINING
THIS. REALLY.

02:08.951 --> 02:11.353
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:13.889 --> 02:16.391
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

02:16.425 --> 02:19.894
WHEN THAT FLOSS
CAME FLYING
OUT OF MY POCKET.

02:19.929 --> 02:22.630
WHAT FLOSS? WHEN?

02:22.665 --> 02:24.966
DURING
THE INTERMISSION
OF THE PLAY,

02:25.001 --> 02:29.437
I WAS BUYING HER A
CONTAINER OF ORANGE
DRINK FOR $5.00.

02:29.472 --> 02:31.973
I REACH INTO
MY POCKET TO PAY,

02:32.008 --> 02:34.909
THERE'S THIS
GREEN FLOSS HANGING
FROM MY FINGERS.

02:34.944 --> 02:36.077
AH, MINT.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.112
OF COURSE.

02:37.146 --> 02:39.114
SO I'M LOOKING
AT IT.

02:39.148 --> 02:42.417
I LOOK UP AND SEE
SHE'S LOOKING AT IT.

02:42.451 --> 02:44.452
OUR EYES LOCK.

02:44.487 --> 02:46.755
IT WAS
A HORRIBLE MOMENT.

02:46.789 --> 02:47.822
I JUST...

02:49.492 --> 02:51.760
SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

02:51.794 --> 02:53.328
SHE SAW THE FLOSS.

02:53.362 --> 02:56.798
YOU PANICKED,
AND YOU TOLD HER
YOU LIKED HER.

02:56.832 --> 02:59.334
WITHOUT THAT FLOSS
IN MY POCKET,

02:59.368 --> 03:03.071
I'D BE CRAWLING
AROUND HER BEDROOM,
LOOKING FOR MY GLASSES.

03:03.105 --> 03:05.373
YOU SURE FLOSS
WAS THE CATALYST?

03:05.408 --> 03:06.941
YES, I AM.

03:06.976 --> 03:10.645
YOU DON'T THINK
IT HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT?

03:10.679 --> 03:12.213
YOU DON'T LIKE THIS?

03:12.248 --> 03:16.084
LOOKS LIKE YOUR BELT
IS DIGESTING
A SMALL ANIMAL.

03:17.186 --> 03:19.421
THEY GOT
A CURE FOR CANCER.

03:19.455 --> 03:22.424
SEE, IT'S ALL
BIG BUSINESS.

03:22.458 --> 03:24.893
OH, HEY, JERRY
JUST WALKED IN.

03:24.927 --> 03:27.429
HI, GEORGE!

03:27.463 --> 03:29.731
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
TAKE MY NUMBER.

03:29.765 --> 03:33.902
UH, IT'S 555-8643.

03:33.936 --> 03:37.238
OK. HERE HE IS.

03:37.273 --> 03:38.907
WHO IS IT?

03:38.941 --> 03:40.408
TAKE IT.

03:40.443 --> 03:41.509
WHO IS IT?

03:41.544 --> 03:43.178
IT'S FOR YOU.

03:44.447 --> 03:45.413
HELLO?

03:45.448 --> 03:47.449
OH, HI, JOEL.

03:47.483 --> 03:49.918
NO, I WAS
OUT OF TOWN.

03:49.952 --> 03:51.453
I JUST GOT BACK.

03:51.487 --> 03:52.954
KRAMER DOESN'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

03:52.988 --> 03:54.422
HE'S JUST
MY NEIGHBOR.

03:54.457 --> 03:56.925
UH, NOTHING MUCH.

03:56.959 --> 03:58.860
TUESDAY?

03:58.894 --> 04:00.562
UM, TUESDAY, NO,

04:00.596 --> 04:02.363
I'M MEETING...
SOMEBODY.

04:02.398 --> 04:05.200
UH, WEDNESDAY?

04:05.234 --> 04:06.935
WEDNESDAY'S OK.

04:06.969 --> 04:11.239
ALL RIGHT,
I'M A LITTLE BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

04:11.273 --> 04:12.907
CAN WE TALK
WEDNESDAY MORNING?

04:12.942 --> 04:16.411
OK. YEAH, RIGHT.
THANKS, BYE.

04:16.445 --> 04:19.414
WHY PUT ME ON
THE PHONE WITH HIM?

04:19.447 --> 04:22.417
I HATE JUST BEING
HANDED A PHONE.

04:22.451 --> 04:24.819
HE WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

04:24.854 --> 04:26.888
MAYBE I DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK
TO HIM.

04:26.922 --> 04:27.889
WHY NOT?

04:27.923 --> 04:29.457
HE BOTHERS ME.

04:29.492 --> 04:32.494
I DON'T ANSWER
THE PHONE
BECAUSE OF HIM.

04:32.528 --> 04:34.929
HE'S TURNED ME
INTO A SCREENER.

04:34.964 --> 04:37.632
NOW I GOT TO
SEE HIM ON WEDNESDAY.

04:37.666 --> 04:40.435
WE HAD TICKETS
TO THE KNICK GAME
WEDNESDAY.

04:40.469 --> 04:42.604
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE'RE NOT GOING?

04:42.638 --> 04:46.141
WE'RE GOING.
THAT'S NEXT WEDNESDAY.

04:46.175 --> 04:48.910
OH. WHO IS
THIS GUY?

04:48.944 --> 04:50.445
HIS NAME'S JOEL HORNECK.

04:50.479 --> 04:53.281
HE LIVED NEAR ME
WHEN I GREW UP.

04:53.315 --> 04:56.651
HE HAD A PING-PONG TABLE.
WE WERE FRIENDS.

04:56.685 --> 05:01.122
SHOULD I SUFFER
ALL MY LIFE BECAUSE
I LIKE PING-PONG?

05:01.157 --> 05:02.657
I WAS 10!

05:02.691 --> 05:05.393
I WOULD'VE BEEN
FRIENDS WITH STALIN

05:05.427 --> 05:08.930
IF HE HAD
A PING-PONG TABLE.

05:08.964 --> 05:12.367
HE'S SO SELF-INVOLVED.

05:12.401 --> 05:14.369
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

05:14.403 --> 05:15.870
[RING]

05:15.905 --> 05:17.338
THAT'S FOR ME.

05:18.908 --> 05:20.909
KRAMERICA INDUSTRIES.

05:20.943 --> 05:22.944
OH, HI, MARK.

05:22.978 --> 05:26.447
NO, NO. FORGET THAT.
I GOT A BETTER IDEA--

05:26.482 --> 05:28.917
A PIZZA PLACE WHERE
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN PIE.

05:28.951 --> 05:31.452
CAN YOU CONDUCT
YOUR BUSINESS...
ELSEWHERE?

05:31.487 --> 05:34.455
I'M TALKING ABOUT
A WHOLE CHAIN OF THEM.

05:34.490 --> 05:35.657
YEAH.

05:37.860 --> 05:41.930
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU BOTHER
WITH THIS PING-PONG GUY.

05:41.964 --> 05:44.399
HE'S BEEN CALLING
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

05:44.433 --> 05:45.967
I NEVER CALLED HIM.

05:46.001 --> 05:48.970
HE'S GOT
THE ATTENTION SPAN
OF A 5-YEAR-OLD.

05:49.004 --> 05:53.441
I MAKE UP THINGS
JUST TO SEE IF HE'S
PAYING ATTENTION.

05:53.475 --> 05:56.611
WHY DO YOU SPEND TIME
WITH THIS GUY?

05:56.645 --> 05:58.947
WHAT CAN I DO--
BREAK UP?

05:58.981 --> 06:01.849
TELL HIM WE'RE NOT RIGHT
FOR EACH OTHER?

06:01.884 --> 06:03.551
IT'S A GUY.

06:03.586 --> 06:06.054
WITH A WOMAN
THERE'S A PRECEDENT.

06:06.088 --> 06:08.456
THE RELATIONSHIP
SOURS, YOU END IT.

06:08.490 --> 06:10.058
NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:10.092 --> 06:13.061
APPROACH THIS
AS IF HE WAS
A WOMAN.

06:13.095 --> 06:14.262
BREAK UP?

06:14.296 --> 06:15.663
ABSOLUTELY.

06:15.698 --> 06:17.065
TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

06:17.099 --> 06:18.333
THE TRUTH?

06:24.673 --> 06:28.676
SO MY SHRINK
WANTS MY MOTHER IN
FOR A SESSION.

06:28.711 --> 06:30.178
THIS GUY
IS BRILLIANT.

06:30.212 --> 06:32.513
LENNY BRUCE
USED TO GO TO HIM,

06:32.548 --> 06:34.349
AND, I THINK,
UH, GERALDO.

06:35.551 --> 06:36.985
I READ THE LENNY BRUCE
BIOGRAPHY.

06:37.019 --> 06:39.520
I THOUGHT IT WAS--

06:39.555 --> 06:40.989
HEY, WE'RE
STARVING HERE!

06:41.023 --> 06:41.990
INTERESTING--

06:42.024 --> 06:43.791
WE'VE WAITED 10 MINUTES.

06:43.826 --> 06:45.293
THAT HE WOULD...

06:48.397 --> 06:51.099
DO YOU THINK
I NEED A HAIRCUT?

06:51.133 --> 06:52.500
ARE YOU READY?

06:52.534 --> 06:55.236
I'LL HAVE
THE EGG SALAD
ON WHOLE WHEAT.

06:55.271 --> 06:57.272
LET ME ASK
A QUESTION.

06:57.306 --> 07:01.209
THIS TURKEY SANDWICH--
IS THAT REAL TURKEY
OR TURKEY ROLL?

07:01.243 --> 07:04.145
I DON'T WANT
PROCESSED TURKEY.
I HATE IT.

07:04.179 --> 07:06.581
I THINK
IT'S REAL TURKEY.

07:06.615 --> 07:08.549
THERE'S A BIRD
IN BACK?

07:08.584 --> 07:10.585
NO, THERE'S NO BIRD,
BUT--

07:10.619 --> 07:13.621
HOW DO YOU KNOW
FOR SURE?

07:13.656 --> 07:17.058
YOU GO IN THE BACK
AND FIND OUT. OK?

07:18.627 --> 07:20.561
UNBELIEVABLE.

07:23.732 --> 07:26.634
HOW CAN YOU TALK
TO SOMEONE LIKE THAT?

07:26.669 --> 07:28.169
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

07:28.203 --> 07:30.505
YOU LIKE TURKEY ROLL?

07:30.539 --> 07:34.942
LISTEN, JOEL,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

07:34.977 --> 07:39.113
WAIT. YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHO I RAN INTO.

07:39.148 --> 07:41.683
HOWARD METRO.
HOWARD METRO.

07:41.717 --> 07:44.485
HE ASKED ME
IF I STILL SAW YOU.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.788
I SAID, "SURE,
WE'RE GREAT FRIENDS."

07:46.822 --> 07:50.058
ANYWAY,
HOWARD SAYS HELLO.

07:52.494 --> 07:54.896
LISTEN, JOEL...

07:54.930 --> 07:58.266
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD SEE
EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

07:59.568 --> 08:01.002
WHAT?

08:01.036 --> 08:03.671
THIS FRIENDSHIP,
IT'S NOT WORKING.

08:03.706 --> 08:05.840
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:05.874 --> 08:09.644
WE'RE JUST NOT SUITED
TO BE FRIENDS.

08:09.678 --> 08:11.612
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

08:11.647 --> 08:13.147
YOU'RE A NICE GUY,

08:13.182 --> 08:15.483
BUT WE HAVEN'T
ANYTHING IN COMMON.

08:15.517 --> 08:17.051
WHAT DID I DO?

08:17.086 --> 08:19.387
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I DID.

08:19.421 --> 08:20.955
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.

08:20.989 --> 08:22.724
IT'S NOT YOU,
IT'S ME.

08:24.393 --> 08:27.061
IT'S--THIS IS
VERY DIFFICULT.

08:27.096 --> 08:29.063
I CALL YOU TOO MUCH.

08:29.098 --> 08:30.732
YOU'RE A BUSY GUY.

08:30.766 --> 08:32.533
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

08:32.568 --> 08:36.504
YOU'RE ONE
OF THE FEW PEOPLE
I CAN TALK TO.

08:36.538 --> 08:39.407
LOOK, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

08:39.441 --> 08:41.909
I ALWAYS TELL EVERYBODY
ABOUT YOU,

08:41.943 --> 08:44.412
TELL EVERYBODY
TO "GO SEE HIS SHOW!"

08:47.282 --> 08:48.850
I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

08:48.884 --> 08:50.151
I KNOW.

08:50.185 --> 08:52.019
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

08:52.054 --> 08:54.689
BEST FRIEND?
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO YOUR APARTMENT.

08:54.723 --> 08:57.358
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

08:57.393 --> 08:59.761
OK, OK,
FORGET IT. IT'S OK.

08:59.795 --> 09:01.162
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

09:01.196 --> 09:02.230
MEAN WHAT?

09:02.264 --> 09:04.766
I'VE BEEN UNDER
LOTS OF STRESS.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.702
<i>YOU'VE</i> BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS.

09:07.736 --> 09:11.139
CAN WE JUST FORGET
THE WHOLE THING
EVER HAPPENED?

09:11.173 --> 09:12.673
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

09:12.708 --> 09:15.243
I TOOK IT OUT
ON YOU.

09:15.277 --> 09:17.645
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.
STILL FRIENDS.

09:18.814 --> 09:21.282
OK, LOOK.
I TELL YOU WHAT.

09:21.316 --> 09:22.950
I GOT KNICK TICKETS.

09:22.985 --> 09:23.985
THIS WEDNESDAY.

09:24.019 --> 09:25.953
GREAT SEATS
BEHIND THE BENCH.

09:25.988 --> 09:27.388
COME ON.

09:27.423 --> 09:29.090
TONIGHT?

09:30.225 --> 09:31.826
NEXT WEDNESDAY.

09:31.860 --> 09:34.495
IF IT WAS TONIGHT,
I WOULD'VE SAID
TONIGHT.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.998
YOU REALLY
WANT ME TO GO?

09:39.201 --> 09:41.068
YES.

09:44.006 --> 09:45.306
OK.

09:45.340 --> 09:47.408
HERE, TAKE THESE.

09:47.443 --> 09:48.843
OK. GREAT.

09:48.877 --> 09:51.712
THAT WOULD BE--
THAT'D BE GREAT.

09:51.747 --> 09:53.815
SO, NEXT WEDNESDAY.

09:53.849 --> 09:55.516
NEXT WEDNESDAY.

09:56.718 --> 09:58.519
SAY, WHERE IS
THAT WAITRESS?

09:58.554 --> 09:59.420
HEY!

10:01.000 --> 10:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:13.202 --> 10:18.005
SHE CALLS ME AT THE OFFICE,
SHE SAYS, "WE HAVE TO TALK."

10:18.040 --> 10:20.341
OH, THE FOUR
WORST WORDS

10:20.375 --> 10:22.343
IN THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE.

10:22.377 --> 10:25.646
THAT OR
"WHOSE BRA IS THIS?"

10:25.681 --> 10:27.348
HMM, THAT IS WORSE.

10:27.382 --> 10:29.851
WE ORDER LUNCH,
AND WE'RE TALKING.

10:29.885 --> 10:32.820
FINALLY, SHE BLURTS OUT
HOW IT'S NOT WORKING.

10:32.855 --> 10:33.821
REALLY.

10:33.856 --> 10:35.490
AS SHE'S SAYING THIS,

10:35.524 --> 10:39.360
I'M THINKING, GREAT.
THE RELATIONSHIP'S OVER
BUT EGG SALAD'S COMING.

10:39.394 --> 10:43.331
SO I HAVE A DECISION--
DO I WALK OR EAT?

10:43.365 --> 10:45.066
YOU ATE.

10:45.100 --> 10:48.169
SAT THERE
FOR 20 MINUTES
CHEWING,

10:48.203 --> 10:49.704
STARING AT EACH OTHER

10:49.738 --> 10:51.706
IN A DEFUNCT
RELATIONSHIP.

10:51.740 --> 10:54.742
SOMEONE SAYS "GET
OUT OF MY LIFE,"

10:54.776 --> 10:56.444
AND THAT
DOESN'T AFFECT
YOUR APPETITE?

10:56.478 --> 10:58.279
EVER HAD
THEIR EGG SALAD?

10:58.313 --> 10:59.447
UNBELIEVABLE.
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:59.481 --> 11:01.949
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE
IS UNBELIEVABLE.

11:01.984 --> 11:05.253
I PICKED UP THE CHECK.
SHE DIDN'T EVEN OFFER.

11:05.287 --> 11:06.821
SHE ENDED IT.

11:06.855 --> 11:10.291
AT LEAST SHE
COULD'VE SENT ME OFF
WITH A SANDWICH.

11:10.325 --> 11:13.094
HOW MUCH COULD YOU
POSSIBLY HAVE IN THERE?

11:13.128 --> 11:15.162
LOOK, IT'S MY MONEY.

11:15.197 --> 11:17.665
SHOULD I THROW IT
OUT THE WINDOW?

11:17.699 --> 11:20.434
I KNOW A GUY
WHO VACATIONED
ON HIS CHANGE.

11:20.469 --> 11:23.304
YEAH?
WHERE'D HE GO--
TO AN ARCADE?

11:23.338 --> 11:25.773
THAT'S FUNNY.
YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY.

11:25.807 --> 11:27.341
COME ON, MOVE UP.

11:27.376 --> 11:28.843
OH, GREAT.
EWING'S HURT.

11:28.877 --> 11:31.345
HOW LONG
WILL HE BE OUT?

11:31.380 --> 11:32.947
A COUPLE DAYS,
BUT...

11:32.981 --> 11:34.115
OH, SHEESH.

11:34.149 --> 11:35.316
OH, GOD.

11:35.350 --> 11:38.553
I GOT SCARED THERE--
THE KNICKS WITHOUT EWING.

11:38.587 --> 11:41.522
LISTEN, GEORGE,
A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH THE GAME.

11:41.557 --> 11:42.590
WHAT?

11:42.624 --> 11:46.294
YESTERDAY,
I KIND OF, UH...

11:46.328 --> 11:47.328
WHAT?

11:47.362 --> 11:51.432
I GAVE YOUR TICKET
TO HORNECK.

11:56.338 --> 11:57.805
YOU WHAT?

11:57.839 --> 12:01.776
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
I HAD TO GIVE IT
TO HORNECK.

12:03.312 --> 12:04.712
NAH.

12:07.282 --> 12:09.383
MY TICKET?

12:09.418 --> 12:11.619
YOU GAVE MY TICKET
TO HORNECK?

12:11.653 --> 12:12.787
MOVE UP.

12:12.821 --> 12:14.655
WHY GIVE HIM
MY TICKET?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.290
YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM.

12:16.325 --> 12:18.759
COME ON.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

12:18.794 --> 12:20.795
I HAD TO DO IT.

12:20.829 --> 12:23.297
CAN YOU CHANGE THIS
INTO BILLS?

12:23.332 --> 12:25.299
SIR, WE CAN'T
DO THAT.

12:25.334 --> 12:27.268
YOU WANT TO GO
WITH HIM?

12:27.302 --> 12:28.469
IT'S OK.

12:28.503 --> 12:31.238
NO. I DON'T EVEN
KNOW THE GUY!

12:31.273 --> 12:33.474
THEY DID THIS
FOR ME BEFORE.

12:33.508 --> 12:35.977
YOU TAKE THESE.
ROLL THEM YOURSELF.

12:36.011 --> 12:38.813
YOU WANT ME TO ROLL
6,000 OF THESE?

12:38.847 --> 12:41.248
WHAT? SHOULD
I QUIT MY JOB?

12:42.818 --> 12:44.318
I'VE HEARD THE EXPRESSION

12:44.353 --> 12:47.088
LAUGHING ALL THE WAY
TO THE BANK.

12:47.122 --> 12:50.291
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
ACTUALLY DO IT.

12:50.325 --> 12:52.126
AND THOSE BANK LINES.

12:52.160 --> 12:56.097
I HATE IT WHEN THERE'S
NOBODY IN LINE AT ALL.

12:56.131 --> 12:57.531
THE BANK IS EMPTY,

12:57.566 --> 13:00.768
AND YOU STILL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THE LITTLE MAZE.

13:00.802 --> 13:03.771
GET SOME CHEESE FOR ME.
I'M NEARLY THERE.

13:03.805 --> 13:06.540
I'D LIKE A REWARD
FOR THIS, PLEASE.

13:07.609 --> 13:08.576
32, 33...

13:08.610 --> 13:09.577
GEORGE.

13:09.611 --> 13:12.580
NOT NOW. 33...

13:12.614 --> 13:13.614
30...

13:13.649 --> 13:15.082
COULD YOU
STOP COUNTING?

13:15.117 --> 13:17.218
OOH, OOH, OOH...

13:18.787 --> 13:19.987
WHAT?

13:20.022 --> 13:23.591
I'M SORRY.
I'LL GIVE YOU $50
FOR THE JUG.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.593
YEAH, SURE.
KEEP YOUR MONEY.

13:25.627 --> 13:27.628
THEN I WON'T GO
EITHER.

13:27.663 --> 13:29.597
I'LL GIVE HIM
BOTH TICKETS.

13:29.631 --> 13:30.598
AW, GEE...

13:30.632 --> 13:31.732
GO. GO!

13:36.838 --> 13:40.007
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GO.

13:40.042 --> 13:41.742
HE WAS REALLY CRYING?

13:41.777 --> 13:43.277
I GAVE HIM TISSUES.

13:43.311 --> 13:44.745
I'LL CALL
HIS MACHINE

13:44.780 --> 13:49.116
AND MAKE SOME EXCUSE
WHY I CAN'T GO
TO THE GAME.

13:49.151 --> 13:50.151
WAIT, WAIT.

13:50.185 --> 13:51.652
IF YOU'RE
GOING TO LIE,

13:51.687 --> 13:54.121
TELL HIM YOU LOST
BOTH TICKETS.

13:54.156 --> 13:55.690
THEN WE CAN GO.

13:55.724 --> 13:58.826
GEORGE, THE MAN WEPT.

14:00.262 --> 14:01.762
OH, HEY, GUYS.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.265
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS PIZZA IDEA

14:04.299 --> 14:05.700
IS REALLY GOING
TO HAPPEN.

14:07.736 --> 14:11.572
THIS IS THE THING WHERE
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN PIZZA?

14:11.606 --> 14:13.107
WE GIVE YOU DOUGH.

14:13.141 --> 14:15.009
YOU SMASH IT,
POUND IT,

14:15.043 --> 14:16.811
FLING IT IN THE AIR.

14:16.845 --> 14:19.613
YOU PUT YOUR SAUCE,
YOUR CHEESE,

14:19.648 --> 14:23.784
AND THEN YOU SLIDE
IT INTO THE OVEN.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.853
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW.

14:25.887 --> 14:29.090
YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE
SHOVING THEIR ARMS

14:29.124 --> 14:30.991
INTO A 600-DEGREE OVEN!

14:31.026 --> 14:32.626
IT'S ALL SUPERVISED.

14:32.661 --> 14:33.894
OH. WELL...

14:33.929 --> 14:37.298
ALL OF IT!
YOU WANT TO INVEST?

14:37.332 --> 14:39.800
MY MONEY'S
TIED UP IN CHANGE.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.802
PEOPLE REALLY
WANT TO MAKE

14:41.837 --> 14:43.304
THEIR OWN
PIZZA PIE!

14:43.338 --> 14:46.707
I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.

14:46.742 --> 14:50.077
I JUST NEVER--
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE,

14:50.112 --> 14:53.080
IN ANY WALK OF LIFE,
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE,

14:53.115 --> 14:56.050
WANTING TO MAKE
THEIR OWN PIZZA PIE.

14:56.084 --> 14:58.285
BUT THAT'S ME. OK?

14:58.320 --> 14:59.320
THAT'S YOU.

14:59.354 --> 15:00.521
ALL RIGHT?

15:00.555 --> 15:02.523
JUST CHECKING
WITH YOU GUYS.

15:02.557 --> 15:04.024
THIS WILL
BE BIG.

15:04.059 --> 15:06.961
I JUST WANT TO--
OK. UH-HUH.

15:08.964 --> 15:12.867
ONE DAY, YOU'LL BEG ME
TO MAKE YOUR OWN PIE.

15:18.006 --> 15:21.909
JOEL, THIS IS JERRY.
I HOPE YOU GET THIS
BEFORE--

15:21.943 --> 15:24.478
HI. OH, YOU JUST CAME IN.

15:24.513 --> 15:28.482
LISTEN, UH, I CAN'T
MAKE IT TO THE GAME TONIGHT.

15:28.517 --> 15:31.285
I, UH, HAVE TO TUTOR
MY NEPHEW.

15:31.319 --> 15:34.088
YEAH, HE'S GOT
AN EXAM TOMORROW.

15:34.122 --> 15:35.623
GEOMETRY.

15:36.725 --> 15:38.292
YOU KNOW,
TRAPEZOID, RHOMBUS.

15:38.326 --> 15:40.795
ANYWAY, LISTEN,
YOU TAKE THE TICKETS.

15:40.829 --> 15:42.797
THEY'RE AT
THE WILL-CALL WINDOW.

15:42.831 --> 15:45.766
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

15:45.801 --> 15:47.768
WE'LL TALK NEXT WEEK, OK?

15:47.803 --> 15:50.437
YEAH. YEAH, I DON'T--FINE.

15:50.472 --> 15:51.639
FINE, BYE.

15:54.643 --> 15:56.143
TRAPEZOIDS?

15:56.178 --> 16:00.181
I KNOW. I'M REALLY
RUNNING OUT OF EXCUSES
WITH THIS GUY.

16:00.215 --> 16:03.017
I NEED SOME KIND
OF EXCUSE ROLODEX.

16:08.223 --> 16:11.625
LET'S GO DO SOMETHING.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.093
WANT TO GET
SOME FOOD?

16:13.128 --> 16:14.228
WHERE?

16:14.262 --> 16:16.564
I DON'T CARE.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

16:17.866 --> 16:21.001
LET'S GO
TO ONE OF THOSE
CAPPUCCINO PLACES.

16:21.036 --> 16:23.270
AND DO WHAT, TALK?

16:24.706 --> 16:26.307
WE CAN TALK.

16:26.341 --> 16:30.077
I'LL GO IF I DON'T
HAVE TO TALK.

16:30.111 --> 16:32.413
THEN WE'LL
JUST SIT THERE.

16:32.447 --> 16:35.349
OK, I'M GOING TO CHECK
MY MACHINE FIRST.

16:39.754 --> 16:42.723
"PICKING SOMEONE UP
AT AIRPORT, JURY DUTY,

16:42.757 --> 16:44.225
"WAITING
FOR CABLE COMPANY."

16:44.259 --> 16:46.861
OK, JUST HAND
THAT OVER, PLEASE.

16:46.895 --> 16:48.395
OH, WHAT IS THIS?

16:48.430 --> 16:50.364
IT'S A LIST
OF EXCUSES

16:50.398 --> 16:51.932
FOR THAT GUY HORNECK

16:51.967 --> 16:54.935
WHO'S AT THE GAME TONIGHT
WITH MY TICKETS.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.872
I HAVE THAT
SO IN CASE HE CALLS,

16:57.906 --> 17:01.775
I JUST CONSULT IT,
AND I DON'T
HAVE TO SEE HIM.

17:01.810 --> 17:02.776
OH, GOD.

17:02.811 --> 17:04.244
I NEED IT.

17:05.313 --> 17:06.780
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:06.815 --> 17:08.781
I GOT SOME FOR YOU.

17:08.817 --> 17:10.751
I DON'T NEED ANY MORE.

17:10.785 --> 17:12.720
NO, THESE ARE GOOD.
LISTEN.

17:12.753 --> 17:14.722
"YOU RAN OUT
OF UNDERWEAR

17:14.756 --> 17:16.790
AND CAN'T
LEAVE THE HOUSE."

17:16.825 --> 17:17.992
VERY FUNNY.

17:18.026 --> 17:20.895
HOW ABOUT,
YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED

17:20.929 --> 17:22.863
AS A MULTIPLE
PERSONALITY?

17:22.897 --> 17:24.365
YOU'RE NOT EVEN YOU.

17:24.398 --> 17:25.933
YOU'RE DAN.

17:27.202 --> 17:30.938
I'M DAN. CAN I HAVE
MY LIST BACK, PLEASE?

17:30.972 --> 17:33.340
HERE, HERE.

17:33.375 --> 17:36.810
GOD, JERRY SEINFELD,
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

17:36.845 --> 17:38.812
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
INFANTILE.

17:40.248 --> 17:41.215
OH!

17:41.249 --> 17:42.950
WHAT CAN I DO?

17:42.984 --> 17:45.252
DEAL WITH IT.
BE A MAN.

17:45.287 --> 17:46.387
OH, NO.

17:47.989 --> 17:51.892
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I'D RATHER LIE
THE REST OF MY LIFE,

17:51.927 --> 17:53.861
THAN GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

17:53.895 --> 17:56.030
HE WAS CRYING--

17:56.064 --> 17:58.899
TEARS, ACCOMPANIED
BY MUCUS.

18:00.368 --> 18:02.770
YOU MADE A MAN CRY?

18:02.804 --> 18:05.272
I NEVER MADE
A MAN CRY.

18:05.307 --> 18:09.643
I KICKED A GUY
IN THE GROIN ONCE,
AND HE DIDN'T CRY.

18:09.678 --> 18:11.045
I GOT THE CAB.

18:12.881 --> 18:14.949
A COUPLE OF TOUGH MONKEYS.

18:17.786 --> 18:18.886
HI, ELAINE.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.355
YOU MISSED A GREAT
GAME TONIGHT.

18:21.389 --> 18:22.389
GAME?

18:22.424 --> 18:24.391
KNICK GAME.
HORNECK TOOK ME.

18:24.426 --> 18:26.493
TWO ROWS
BEHIND THE BENCH.

18:26.528 --> 18:29.396
WE WERE GETTING
HIT BY SWEAT.

18:29.431 --> 18:31.899
WAIT. HOW DOES
HORNECK KNOW YOU?

18:31.933 --> 18:34.902
LAST WEEK, WHEN I
GAVE YOU THE PHONE.

18:34.936 --> 18:37.871
HE'S REALLY INTO
MY PIZZA PLACE IDEA.

18:37.906 --> 18:39.373
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

18:39.407 --> 18:41.508
WHAT PIZZA PLACE IDEA?

18:41.543 --> 18:43.577
YOU MAKE
YOUR OWN PIE.

18:43.611 --> 18:47.781
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GREAT IDEA.
IT WOULD BE FUN.

18:47.816 --> 18:48.782
KRAMER!

18:48.817 --> 18:49.783
YEAH!

18:49.818 --> 18:50.918
PERFECT.

18:50.952 --> 18:52.019
HEY!

18:53.288 --> 18:55.823
OK, UH, WHO WANTS
MEAT LOAF?

18:56.858 --> 18:58.292
NO, THANKS.
NO, NO.

18:58.326 --> 19:01.228
NO? IT'S
GOING TO BE HOT
IN A MINUTE.

19:01.262 --> 19:04.231
SO, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TUTORING
YOUR NEPHEW.

19:04.265 --> 19:05.866
OH, WE FINISHED EARLY.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.701
I'LL BET.

19:07.736 --> 19:10.170
SO ARE YOU GOING
TO INTRODUCE ME

19:10.205 --> 19:12.239
TO YOUR NEPHEW?

19:12.273 --> 19:14.675
ELAINE BENES,
THIS IS
JOEL HORNECK.

19:14.709 --> 19:15.709
HI.

19:15.744 --> 19:18.879
WHOA, NELSON.
THIS IS ELAINE.

19:18.913 --> 19:21.382
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
SPLIT UP.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.883
WE'RE
STILL FRIENDS.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.051
HMM.

19:24.085 --> 19:26.887
SO...THANKS AGAIN
FOR THOSE TICKETS,

19:26.921 --> 19:29.890
BUT NEXT WEEK,
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU.

19:29.924 --> 19:32.393
HOW ABOUT NEXT TUESDAY?
YOU, TOO.

19:32.427 --> 19:35.396
OH, NO, NO,
TUESDAY'S NO GOOD

19:35.430 --> 19:38.065
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT, UH,
CHOIR PRACTICE.

19:38.099 --> 19:41.402
RIGHT. I FORGOT
ABOUT CHOIR.

19:41.436 --> 19:44.238
WE'RE--WE'RE DOING
THAT, UH, EVENING

19:44.272 --> 19:46.206
OF EASTERN EUROPEAN
NATIONAL ANTHEMS.

19:46.241 --> 19:47.441
RIGHT.

19:47.475 --> 19:51.178
YOU KNOW,
THE WALL BEING DOWN
AND EVERYTHING.

19:51.212 --> 19:53.180
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THURSDAY NIGHT?

19:53.214 --> 19:55.582
I MEAN, THEY'RE PLAYING
THE SONICS.

19:55.617 --> 19:56.650
HMM.

19:56.684 --> 19:58.018
THURSDAY IS NOT GOOD

19:58.053 --> 20:00.687
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT
TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL

20:00.722 --> 20:04.191
TO SEE IF WE QUALIFY
AS THOSE ORGAN DONORS.

20:04.225 --> 20:06.994
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD TRY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:07.028 --> 20:09.163
YOU REALLY SHOULD.

20:10.265 --> 20:13.200
WELL, LET'S JUST
TAKE A LOOK HERE.

20:13.234 --> 20:15.335
41 HOME GAMES.

20:15.370 --> 20:17.838
SATURDAY NIGHT
WE'VE GOT THE MAVERICKS.

20:17.872 --> 20:20.374
IF NOT,
NEXT TUESDAY--LAKERS.

20:20.408 --> 20:22.309
YOU GOT TO LIKE
MAGIC, RIGHT?

20:22.343 --> 20:24.244
LET'S SEE.
ON THE ROAD,

20:24.279 --> 20:27.181
ON THE ROAD,
BACK, BACK ON THE 14th

20:27.215 --> 20:28.615
THEY PLAY THE BULLS.

20:28.650 --> 20:30.517
YOU CAN'T MISS AIR JORDAN.

20:32.353 --> 20:35.222
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
COLUMBIA TRISTAR
DOMESTIC TELEVISION

20:38.795 --> 20:41.196
I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THERE ARE CERTAIN FRIENDS,

20:41.231 --> 20:42.531
THEY'RE ALWAYS YOUR FRIENDS,

20:42.565 --> 20:44.400
AND YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

20:44.434 --> 20:46.902
YOU SEE THEM,
YOU DON'T WANT TO.

20:46.936 --> 20:49.905
YOU DON'T CALL THEM,
THEY CALL YOU.

20:49.939 --> 20:52.808
YOU DON'T CALL BACK,
THEY CALL AGAIN.

20:52.842 --> 20:55.244
TO GET THROUGH
TALKING WITH PEOPLE

20:55.278 --> 20:57.746
YOU HAVE NOTHING
IN COMMON WITH,

20:57.781 --> 21:00.749
PRETEND YOU'RE HOSTING
YOUR OWN LITTLE TALK SHOW.

21:00.784 --> 21:03.719
PRETEND THERE'S A LITTLE
DESK AND CHAIR THERE,

21:03.753 --> 21:05.254
AND YOU INTERVIEW THEM.

21:05.288 --> 21:08.757
THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THERE'S NO WAY TO SAY,

21:08.792 --> 21:11.727
"IT'S BEEN GREAT
HAVING YOU ON THE SHOW.

21:11.761 --> 21:13.529
WE'RE OUT OF TIME."

21:13.563 --> 21:18.299
