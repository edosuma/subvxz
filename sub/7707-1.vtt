00:02.937 --> 00:06.705
Kate, this lasagna
looks really great!

00:06.707 --> 00:10.075
Very well worth
the interminable wait.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.913
I asked you twice
to stop doing that.

00:14.915 --> 00:18.550
What? We're just having
a pre-dinner chat.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.320
You know what I mean.

00:21.322 --> 00:24.623
Rhyming everything I say.

00:24.625 --> 00:28.961
No problem, Willie,
have it your way.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.295
Kate!

00:30.297 --> 00:32.131
Kate, he's doing it again.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.432
What?

00:33.434 --> 00:36.335
He's rhyming the last word
of everything I say.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.403
Go ahead, ALF.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.238
He's been doing it all day.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.773
Now, he's got me doing it.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.184
[door opens]

00:52.186 --> 00:53.685
What a creep.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.754
I never want to see him again.

00:57.224 --> 01:00.526
I guess Lynn and her boyfriend
had a fight.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.062
We should go see
if she's alright.

01:03.064 --> 01:06.932
Oh, sure, when Kate makes
a rhyme it's no big deal.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.570
Just for that,
I'm eating your meal.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.240
[theme music]

01:45.272 --> 01:47.272
[music continues]

02:15.569 --> 02:17.035
Okay, dad, your turn.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.070
Okay..

02:22.109 --> 02:23.742
Science or sports?

02:23.744 --> 02:26.044
He'll take science.

02:26.046 --> 02:26.945
Do you mind?

02:26.947 --> 02:29.681
I can pick my own category.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.917
Who won the Super Bowl
last year?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.288
I'll take science.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.792
What is the primary element
of the planet Jupiter?

02:40.794 --> 02:42.561
Oh, it's easy. Hydrogen.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.762
Eh! You're wrong!

02:43.764 --> 02:45.197
It's buttermilk.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.234
Willie's right.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.736
It's hydrogen.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.338
Then why do they call it
the Dairy Planet?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.542
Who calls it the Dairy Planet?

02:56.544 --> 02:57.743
Jupitonians.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.078
It's on their license plates.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.382
Mom, it's your turn.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.784
Okay.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.052
Entertainment.

03:07.054 --> 03:10.289
Okay, uh,
what singing phenomenon--

03:10.291 --> 03:12.824
Eh! Florence Henderson.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.093
ALF, it's not your turn.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.696
The answer's not
Florence Henderson.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.798
It's Shirley Jones.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.634
Oh, like there's
really a difference.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.407
Mail's here.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.342
Not that it matters.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.744
Oh, come and join us, honey.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.279
Take ALF's place.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.050
I don't really feel like it.

03:38.052 --> 03:41.520
I'll be in my room.
Not that it matters.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.823
Gee, what a downer.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.960
It's only been a week
since she broke up with L-Lloyd.

03:47.962 --> 03:52.364
I never understood,
why he pronounced both the Ls.

03:52.366 --> 03:56.134
Because he was a l-lox.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.571
You know, it takes a little time
to get over a break-up.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.839
I'm gonna go check on her.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.475
Well, see you l-later.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.311
ALF, there's
a book here for you.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.913
You ordered a book?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.348
Don't worry, Wilco.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.549
It was free.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.118
For joining
the Book-of-the-Month Club.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.687
You joined
the Book-of-the-Month Club?

04:15.689 --> 04:18.056
Well, technically, you did.

04:18.058 --> 04:21.727
Fortunately, they didn't
run a credit check.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.796
"Shelley Winters' Guide
to True Love?"

04:24.798 --> 04:26.365
We're sending it back.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.666
It's not for me.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.635
It's to help Lynn.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.371
Oh-ho. This'll be a great help.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.739
"Chapter One.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.408
Love is like a pizza."

04:36.410 --> 04:38.777
Brilliant!

04:38.779 --> 04:40.746
"Love is like a pizza.

"Sometimes it's cold and flat

ALF, I don't wanna
talk about love..

04:54.361 --> 04:56.395
...or pizza.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.763
Well, according to Shelley

04:57.765 --> 05:00.499
you're wallowing
in the muck of self-pity.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.700
She says you'll feel better

05:01.702 --> 05:04.403
if you confide
in a close friend.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.239
So come on, confide.

05:07.241 --> 05:08.507
Alright.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.611
L-Lloyd wants to go out
with other girls.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.714
Ugh. There's that name again.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.083
Do you want me
to confide or not?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.685
Sorry.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.286
L-Lloyd.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.457
We were so perfect
for each other.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.426
We were gonna get married
at the planetarium.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.329
He was even gonna
name a comet after me.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.531
What was he
gonna name it? L-Lynn?

05:35.102 --> 05:37.002
Last time, I promise.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.471
[knock on door]

05:39.473 --> 05:41.206
She wants to be alone!

05:41.208 --> 05:43.041
[door opens]

05:43.043 --> 05:44.242
I just dropped in
to say goodnight

05:44.244 --> 05:46.411
and see if you need anything.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.245
No thanks, mom.

05:47.247 --> 05:50.048
Frozen yogurt for me, thanks.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.783
ALF, I was asking Lynn.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.153
From that place at the mall,
if you're going that way.

05:58.425 --> 06:01.126
Drive carefully.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.995
I'll never love anyone again.

06:03.997 --> 06:08.100
Oh, sure.
Let's get back to your problem.

06:08.102 --> 06:11.136
ALF, you're the one
who wanted me to talk about it.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.738
Alright.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.575
Aren't there any other fellas
you'd like to date?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.510
Well..

06:18.512 --> 06:20.479
...there is this one guy..

06:20.481 --> 06:22.814
But that doesn't mean
he'd wanna go out with me.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.249
Well, who is it?

06:24.251 --> 06:26.218
His name is Danny Duckworth.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.520
He's on the baseball team.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.554
Let's see..

06:31.992 --> 06:34.059
Uh...here's his picture.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.397
The dork holding
the water bucket?

06:38.399 --> 06:40.332
No, no, no,
that's his cousin Donnie.

06:40.334 --> 06:43.735
See, Danny's the one
swinging the three bats.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.504
So call him up.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.707
I can't do that,
he'd know I like him.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.509
You don't want the boy you like

06:50.511 --> 06:52.544
to know you like him?

06:52.546 --> 06:55.013
- Right.
- Makes sense.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.481
You don't understand.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.749
Oh, I understand.

06:57.751 --> 07:01.019
Nobody on this planet
ever says what they mean.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.587
We say what we mean.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.090
As long as the other person
says it first.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.897
Shelley, Shelley,
it's up to you, babe.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.866
Come on. Don't let me down.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.302
Ah. "Chapter Two.

Well, there you have it.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.047
Yo, operator.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.683
Do you have a listing
for a Duckworth?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.885
[instrumental music]

07:37.925 --> 07:41.626
Why would he even try
making banana coffee?

07:41.628 --> 07:46.898
I don't think you even
want...to know.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.102
Hey, Willie,
when's the last time

07:51.104 --> 07:53.071
you changed
the blades in this razor?

07:53.073 --> 07:55.307
Oh, my-my razor is elec..

07:55.309 --> 07:57.309
[gasps]

07:59.646 --> 08:01.146
Why were you shaving?

08:01.148 --> 08:05.250
According to Shelley
women like clean-shaven men.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.953
Don't ever touch..

08:07.955 --> 08:11.189
...anything that
touches my face.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.963
(Lynn)
'ALF?'

08:17.965 --> 08:20.332
How could you do this to me?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.634
I couldn't find my own roll-on.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.703
Lynn, what's wrong?

08:24.705 --> 08:26.605
I have got a date to go bowling

08:26.607 --> 08:30.675
with Donnie Duckworth,
the geekiest guy in school

08:30.677 --> 08:33.011
thanks to my brother ALF.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.045
Your brother?

08:34.047 --> 08:35.180
That's what he told Donnie

08:35.182 --> 08:37.115
when he called him on the phone.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.183
You wanted me to.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.885
I did not want you to!

08:39.887 --> 08:42.087
Well, you said
you liked the guy.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.322
I said I liked Danny Duckworth.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.025
You called Donnie, his cousin.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.528
Danny, Donnie,
Florence, Shirley.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.730
I'm getting a headache!

08:51.732 --> 08:53.832
Think I'll go lie down.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.267
Well, hold it right there, bro.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.102
I think you have
one more phone call to make

08:57.104 --> 08:58.937
to get this thing
straightened out.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.172
It's too late, mom.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.141
Donnie has already bought us

09:03.143 --> 09:05.844
matching bowling shirts.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.612
That was my idea!

09:07.614 --> 09:09.714
I hope you like paisley.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.219

09:15.756 --> 09:17.489
Now, the secret to bowling

09:17.491 --> 09:22.093
or talequoits, as it's known
in the civilized universe

09:22.095 --> 09:23.995
is in the wrist action.

09:23.997 --> 09:27.098
And in the ripeness
of the melon.

09:30.037 --> 09:33.338
Ugh! We don't bowl
with cantaloupes.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.807
Then, what do you bowl with?

09:35.809 --> 09:38.076
Heavy plastic balls.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.111
You're kidding.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.747
Well, at least
it's something edible.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.982
[doorbell dings]

09:43.984 --> 09:46.318
Oh, great. Donnie's here.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.321
Now, remember,
according to Shelley

09:49.323 --> 09:53.592
dating is the best therapy
for a failed romance.

09:53.594 --> 09:57.128
That and chocolate.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.497
Hi, you must be
Donnie Duckworth.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.765
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

10:00.767 --> 10:01.800
But I'm Danny Duckworth

10:01.802 --> 10:03.835
I'm Donnie Duckworth's cousin.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.704
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.672
Where's Donnie...Duckworth?

10:07.674 --> 10:09.608
Hm, Danny?

10:09.610 --> 10:11.743
Well, he got so nervous
about this date

10:11.745 --> 10:14.813
that he started
pukin' his guts out.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.414
Oh, that's not good.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.116
Yeah, he had a date
with a cheerleader once

10:18.118 --> 10:20.852
nearly coughed up his spleen.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.854
That's not good either.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.623
Uh, Lynn?

10:26.326 --> 10:29.728
Hi, I'm Mrs. Tanner,
you must be...Donnie Duckworth?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.730
No, no, I'm Danny Duckworth.
See, Donnie couldn't come--

10:31.732 --> 10:34.332
Uh, yeah, it involves
organ displacement, dear.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.468
I'll-I'll fill you in later.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.371
You know, I hope it's okay
with Lynn that I came instead.

10:39.373 --> 10:40.839
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm sure she won't mind.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.475
Oh, good.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.877
Danny Duckworth.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.612
Hiya, Lynn.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.914
Donnie's sick,
so I-I just came instead.

10:49.916 --> 10:50.949
I hope that's okay.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.884
Are you kidding?

10:52.886 --> 10:55.453
I mean, I-I guess so.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.155
He gave us these
bowling shirts

10:57.157 --> 10:58.790
but I-I don't
really like bowling.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.759
So I thought maybe
we'd go to a drive-in.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.793
Is that okay too?

11:01.795 --> 11:04.295
That's fantastic!

11:04.297 --> 11:07.465
I mean...that's fine.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.769
The only snag is, uh,
I don't have a car.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.970
What happened to your van?

11:11.972 --> 11:14.873
Oh, that's where Donnie vomited.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.408
That's not good.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.282
¶ Ay oh whey oh ¶

11:24.284 --> 11:28.053
¶ Ay oh whey oh ¶

11:28.055 --> 11:32.657
¶ Walk like an Egyptian ¶¶

11:32.659 --> 11:35.760
(Lynn)
'Bye! Thanks for letting us
use the car.'

11:37.197 --> 11:39.864
Hide like an Egyptian.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.800
Well, this is it.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.635
Uh, can I drive?

11:43.637 --> 11:46.137
- I think I'd better drive.
- Oh, okay.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.173
But when we get there,
can we just change places

11:48.175 --> 11:50.141
in case we see anybody we know?

11:50.143 --> 11:53.044
- Sure.
- Thanks.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.546
Oh, great, we're going bowling

11:54.548 --> 11:56.481
and I don't even
have a cantaloupe.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.186
[instrumental music]

12:07.360 --> 12:08.793
You know, I'm sorry
about this movie

12:08.795 --> 12:10.962
it was supposed
to be "Moonstruck," you know.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.731
Oh, that's okay.

12:12.733 --> 12:16.167
I've been dying
to see "Death Wish 11."

12:18.905 --> 12:20.638
Do-do you want some popcorn or..

12:20.640 --> 12:22.607
Oh, not right now.

12:22.609 --> 12:25.143
Thanks.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.079
(Danny)
'Nachos? How about some nachos?'

12:28.081 --> 12:29.514
(Lynn)
'No, thanks.'

12:34.554 --> 12:36.554
[clicking]

12:40.627 --> 12:41.926
[gunfire]

12:41.928 --> 12:44.562
[screams]
What, it-it's just
a flesh wound.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.264
Hey, I thought that
you wanted to be a doctor.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.100
I do, but right now
I-I want some popcorn.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.268
Would you mind,
I just, I suddenly got

12:50.270 --> 12:52.403
this uncontrollable urge
for popcorn.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.239
Oh, sure. Sure.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.578
Do you want the $8 size
or-or the 12?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.881
- You decide.
- Okay.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.488
Hi.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.024
What are you doing in this car?

13:13.026 --> 13:15.026
Missing "Designing Women."

13:15.028 --> 13:17.262
And for what?

13:17.264 --> 13:18.897
What if Danny sees you?

13:18.899 --> 13:20.331
Hey, I'm trapped here

13:20.333 --> 13:23.201
so let's just make
the best of it, okay?

13:23.203 --> 13:25.436
You are gonna ruin everything.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.938
What's to ruin?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.339
We're sitting in a parking lot

13:28.341 --> 13:30.809
listening to a movie.

13:30.811 --> 13:31.643
This is a drive-in.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.044
It's just like
a regular movie

13:33.046 --> 13:36.414
except you stay in your car.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.184
Well, at least I can order food.

13:39.186 --> 13:42.954
Yo, Jack! I'll have a burger
and some fries.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.722
That speaker is for the movie.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.592
Oh, hey, can you roll
"Animal House"

13:47.594 --> 13:49.861
for the blue station wagon?

13:49.863 --> 13:52.597
Get down, Danny's gonna
be back any minute.

13:52.599 --> 13:56.501
Well, then you might wanna
take a look at chapter nine.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.837
"Laying the trap."

13:58.839 --> 14:02.640
I don't need your help,
or Shelley's.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.643
Do I have to remind you
what you'd be doing tonight

14:05.645 --> 14:08.613
if it weren't for our help?

14:08.615 --> 14:09.514
What?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.616
Do the words, "Go fish, Brian"

14:11.618 --> 14:12.750
ring a bell?

14:13.820 --> 14:15.820
[instrumental music]

14:17.557 --> 14:20.992
Why is Lucky's water dish
in the microwave?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.527
ALF!

14:22.529 --> 14:24.963
I already looked for ALF.
I can't find him anywhere.

14:24.965 --> 14:28.299
Well, did you check
under our bed?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.168
- Yup.
- In the garage?

14:30.170 --> 14:31.769
- Yup.
- In the car?

14:31.771 --> 14:33.838
- What car?
- Our car.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.807
Our car is gone.

14:35.809 --> 14:39.510
Willie, Lynn took our car
to the drive-in.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.946
Oh, sure, she'll take
ALF to the drive-in

14:41.948 --> 14:43.781
but not me.

14:43.783 --> 14:44.616
[doorbell dings]

14:44.618 --> 14:46.451
Kate, you answer the door.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.020
I'll go to the drive-in
and get ALF.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.989
[gasping]
I can't go to the drive-in

14:50.991 --> 14:53.224
Lynn's got the car!

14:53.226 --> 14:54.692
You know, perhaps
this isn't the best time

14:54.694 --> 14:56.261
to raise this issue
but I still think

14:56.263 --> 14:58.463
we need a second car.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.765
- Hi, Kate.
- Oh, Trevor.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.167
Trevor, could we borrow
your car?

15:03.169 --> 15:05.003
Whatever happened to,
"Hi, neighbor, how are ya?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.105
How was the hunting trip?
Here's your mail?"

15:07.107 --> 15:09.073
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.409
Hi, neighbor, how are ya?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.677
How was your hunting trip?

15:12.679 --> 15:15.013
Well, we left last Saturday.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.848
And the first thing
that happened was

15:16.850 --> 15:20.251
we pulled out of the driveway
and got a flat tire.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.121
Took Raquel
a half hour to fix it.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.455
Then everything was fine

15:24.457 --> 15:27.125
until we get up around Big Pine.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.260
We got onto Highway 190

15:29.262 --> 15:31.195
and about 15 miles down the road

15:31.197 --> 15:33.598
we ran smack into a detour.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.867
Right down a gravel road.

15:35.869 --> 15:39.237
- Your mail.
- Oh, thanks.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.039
Now, can we borrow your car?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.408
Don't you wanna hear
about the gravel road?

15:43.410 --> 15:44.676
Not really.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.445
I mean, I-I.. I'd-I'd love to

15:47.447 --> 15:48.479
Trevor, but I gotta run.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.348
I'm sure Kate would.

15:50.350 --> 15:54.118
(Trevor)
'So anyway, we finally
got back onto 190'

15:54.120 --> 15:56.321
and got to this town Falstaff.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.556
Hm, not even a souvenir shop.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.992
No Stuckey's, no nothin'.

16:00.994 --> 16:04.529
We ended up eating
at this place called Food Here.

16:04.531 --> 16:09.000
Not bad, but they didn't have
any Sweet'N Low.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.837
So, uh, you and L-Larry
broke up, huh?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.107
You mean L-Lloyd?

16:16.109 --> 16:18.476
Oh, ye-yeah.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.911
That's right.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.145
[tires squeal]

16:21.147 --> 16:23.147
[siren wails]

16:30.290 --> 16:31.489
Oh! Did I do that?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.690
I don't think
that you could have.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.593
I must have.
I'm always dropping things.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.627
Well, it's okay.
I'll just clean it all up.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.830
No! I mean, leave it.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.698
My father likes
to clean out the car.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.935
He-he got a Dustbuster
for Father's Day.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.069
Okay.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.547
[choking]

16:56.549 --> 16:59.417
[coughing]

16:59.419 --> 17:00.785
Are you alright?

17:00.787 --> 17:02.220
I'll let you know in a minute.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.592
I'm okay.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.826
[retching]

17:08.828 --> 17:10.895
[coughing]

17:10.897 --> 17:12.530
Actually, I could
use a soft drink.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.531
Oh, well-well, what kind?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.533
[coughs]
Root beer's fine.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.302
Do-do you want
the 7.50 size or the $10?

17:18.304 --> 17:20.505
[coughing]
You decide.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.844
You know I hate root beer.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.813
Why are you ruining
this date for me?

17:28.815 --> 17:31.716
You call this a date?
This isn't a date.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.151
This is an oil painting.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.287
I don't even know
why you bothered to go.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.855
Because some nosy alien

17:37.857 --> 17:40.558
got me a date over the phone.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.529
Nosy? Is that
a snide snout remark?

17:46.066 --> 17:47.131
Just forget it.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.100
I wish this whole thing
never happened.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.536
Well, then,
let's ditch this Danny dude

17:51.538 --> 17:53.071
and hit the road.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.839
- No.
- Why?

17:54.841 --> 17:58.042
Well, because
it would be rude and..

17:58.044 --> 18:01.179
...and because he-he'd
have to walk home.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.680
And because...

18:02.682 --> 18:05.716
Because you like him.

18:05.718 --> 18:09.821
Well, yeah. I like him.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.790
Ever since tenth grade.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.826
But I'm not gonna tell him.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.160
Why not?

18:16.162 --> 18:18.162
Because I made
that mistake with L-Lloyd

18:18.164 --> 18:19.330
and look what happened.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.465
So what?

18:20.467 --> 18:21.699
You think that's the only time

18:21.701 --> 18:23.701
you're gonna get dumped?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.670
Shelley says,
"There's a broken light

18:25.672 --> 18:27.872
for every heart on Broadway."

18:27.874 --> 18:31.809
I am so tired of Shelley
telling me what to do.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.812
Lynn, this doesn't
just come from Shelley.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.748
It comes from the old ALFer.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.385
Hey, you think I haven't
had a few experiences

18:41.387 --> 18:43.254
with the opposite sexes?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.691
Have you ever
had your heart broken?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.292
Many times.

18:48.294 --> 18:52.797
I was engaged
to one woman for 58 years.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.000
What was her name?

18:56.002 --> 18:58.102
Ruby.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.204
So what happened to her?

19:00.206 --> 19:02.206
She took her love to town.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.177
Even though I said don't.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.947
I'm sorry.

19:09.949 --> 19:14.585
The very next day
I met Rhonda at a pet bake.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.388
And I thought, she's beautiful.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.524
Boy, I want her.

19:19.526 --> 19:22.126
But I was afraid
I might get hurt again.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.195
So what'd you do?

19:24.197 --> 19:25.930
Well, I waited 17 years

19:25.932 --> 19:28.032
then I asked her out.

19:28.034 --> 19:33.271
The day after that,
my planet exploded.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.973
Seventeen years, wasted.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.378
I understand, ALF. Thanks.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.445
Oh, get down. Danny's coming.

19:41.447 --> 19:42.914
Yeah, yeah.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.420
I couldn't decide,
so I, I got you both.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.788
Thanks.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.059
Danny..

19:55.061 --> 19:56.360
...there's something
I wanna tell you.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.030
- What? You didn't want ice?
- No, no.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.499
Um..

20:01.501 --> 20:04.302
[sighs]
Ever since tenth grade..

20:04.304 --> 20:08.239
Oh, yeah,
old lady Cassidy's class.

20:08.241 --> 20:12.143
Boy, I had
such a crush on you.

20:12.145 --> 20:16.080
- You had a crush on me?
- Yeah.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.282
Well, how come
you never told me?

20:18.284 --> 20:21.219
Well, I didn't want
you to know that I liked you.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.789
You know, that's the trouble
with Earthlings.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.658
I mean, people.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.594
They never say what they mean.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.996
If this planet
were to explode tomorrow

20:31.998 --> 20:35.366
just think of all the time
we would have wasted.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.301
Huh?

20:37.303 --> 20:39.604
Never mind.

20:39.606 --> 20:43.908
- I'm just happy you like me.
- I like you a lot.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.043
In fact, I paid Donnie
to say that he was sick

20:46.045 --> 20:48.045
so that I could
go out with you.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.381
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

20:50.383 --> 20:53.417
[chuckles]
That's so cute.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.857
Wait a minute, you bought me.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.959
Twenty bucks and the use
of my van for the night.

21:01.961 --> 21:05.029
Plus, I had to reimburse them
for the bowling shirts.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.797
But, boy, you're worth it.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.104
(Willie)
'Excuse me.'

21:15.208 --> 21:18.075
Lynn, it's your dad.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.447
- Dad!
- Hi.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.416
Hi, Lynn. Hi, Danny.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.617
Hi there, Mr. Tanner.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.654
What a nice surprise.

21:29.656 --> 21:33.624
Uh, Lynn, uh,
this is gonna sound strange

21:33.626 --> 21:35.626
but, uh..

21:35.628 --> 21:37.595
...your mother couldn't

21:37.597 --> 21:39.864
go to sleep tonight..

21:39.866 --> 21:41.732
...because she didn't have

21:41.734 --> 21:44.035
that old orange blanket.

21:44.037 --> 21:47.571
You know that old, furry blanket

21:47.573 --> 21:49.974
that's always getting lost.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.544
Yeah, you know,
I think it's right back there.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.513
It..

21:55.515 --> 21:57.948
It sure is.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.786
I'm just gonna, uh, grab it.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.587
And then I'm gonna be on my way.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.989
- Okay.
- You guys just go..

22:04.991 --> 22:08.826
Why don't you guys just go back
and watch the movie?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.695
Danny, what's happening now?

22:10.697 --> 22:12.263
Uh, Bronson just snuffed
another guy

22:12.265 --> 22:16.233
because they gave him
his steak well done.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.936
Okay, I got it.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.272
Yes, I do. Ugh.

22:21.274 --> 22:24.775
[grunting]
I sure have got it.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.644
(Willie)
'Now, I'll be on my way.'

22:28.981 --> 22:30.314
at the concession stand?'

No, we can't.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.884

very reasonable.'

Yeah, and you two snuck in.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.913
