Hey, I already checked
those reserve flaps.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.359
Hey.
You think I'm not doing my job?

11:05.186 --> 11:06.535
Trust me, man, I've seen
what the fuck can go wrong

11:06.578 --> 11:07.884
with a reserve chute.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.233
Okay? I don't need
you checking my work.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.671
-Spenser, easy...
-Shut your mouth, Karlson.

11:11.714 --> 11:15.457
Hey, protocol is two inspectors
check the gear, Spenser.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.200
What the hell's
got you on tilt?

11:19.243 --> 11:21.855
Take a seat,
the rest of us will handle this.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.254
[line ringing]

11:30.298 --> 11:32.430
You've reached Clay.
You know what to do.

11:36.739 --> 11:37.958
What's all this?

11:38.001 --> 11:39.916
Uh, just trying
to create something.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.049
Clay's medkit
got blown clean off him

11:42.092 --> 11:43.920
right before I got to him,

11:43.964 --> 11:45.748
and I ended up having
to use mine,

11:45.792 --> 11:47.315
and that is no bueno.

11:48.272 --> 11:49.883
So, what are you thinking?

11:49.926 --> 11:51.188
I think if I could
flatten it all out

11:51.232 --> 11:52.973
and stretch out my blow kit

11:53.016 --> 11:54.322
and put it under
my ballistic plate...

11:54.365 --> 11:57.107
Actually, that's
a pretty smart idea, Sonny.

11:57.151 --> 11:59.719
Why does every damn compliment
I ever get

11:59.762 --> 12:01.895
always start with "actually"?

12:01.938 --> 12:03.766
Look, I'm the one guy
who's always been saying

12:03.810 --> 12:05.333
you're more than just a shooter.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.814
Yeah, you've always seen
my potential way before I did.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.685
I mean, you did draft me,
after all.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.340
Yeah. Yeah.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.864
Actually, I got stuck
with the last pick, so...

12:15.909 --> 12:17.867
[laughing]

12:17.911 --> 12:20.348
Hey, so, uh,
what Clay went through...

12:21.436 --> 12:24.265
You're, uh, just--
trying to help the next guy.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.571
Something to do
between cracking skulls

12:26.615 --> 12:28.182
and getting back to help Clay.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.837
You hear from him?
You know, I...

12:30.880 --> 12:33.230
I tried texting him.
I didn't hear back.

12:33.274 --> 12:36.059
No, no, I... I haven't heard
from him, either.

12:36.103 --> 12:39.193
But, you know, uh...
you know Clay.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.064
-He's just probably busy, or...
-Yeah, I mean,

12:41.108 --> 12:43.023
between Green Team
and his family,

12:43.066 --> 12:45.503
he's got a lot on his plate.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.812
Once there's a check-in
from Echo Team,

12:49.856 --> 12:51.988
-I want to vet
their Caracas package.
-Yes, ma'am.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.860
Lieutenant, I've got
something on Syria.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.383
Thank you.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.559
It's still unclear
why a local Syrian militia

12:57.602 --> 13:00.040
ventures to the coast of Turkey
to attack our ship, but...

13:00.083 --> 13:01.737
"Why" comes after
"who" and "where."

13:01.781 --> 13:03.043
What do we have on Yasiri?

13:03.086 --> 13:05.349
FRS identified this man
as having been born

13:05.393 --> 13:07.003
in the same tiny village
as Yasiri.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.875
Close in age,
must go way back with the boss.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.180
Well, if anybody's
getting face time

13:10.224 --> 13:11.791
with Yasiri, it'd be him.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.836
And this building he went into
three times last week,

13:13.880 --> 13:15.316
check out these
cell phone patterns.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.840
Two times, a cell phone goes
into that building,

13:17.884 --> 13:19.320
and minutes after emerging,

13:19.363 --> 13:21.801
initiates a down-network
cascade of communications.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.846
What's that sound like to you?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.456
Soldiers getting their orders.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.895
My money says the man
that's giving them is in there.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.768
Yeah.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.249
Ah. Yo, I need a team

13:35.292 --> 13:37.164
to get eyes
on a possible HVT location.

13:37.207 --> 13:40.167
Well, all right.
I'll roll with Sonny.

13:40.210 --> 13:43.605
Well, yeah, you see,
Sonny's on a supply run

13:43.648 --> 13:46.869
with Brock and Trent,
and I gotta hold it down here.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.045
-So, that just leaves...
-Me and Omar.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.874
Awkward car rides
are a small price to pay

13:51.918 --> 13:53.441
for a shot at our white whale.

13:55.095 --> 13:58.098
-Yep.
-Yep.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.499
Way you swooped in
when Ray was telling me

14:08.543 --> 14:10.458
about his captivity--

14:10.501 --> 14:12.939
you weren't protecting him
from me, were you?

14:12.982 --> 14:16.072
-Ray can take care of himself.
-Check.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.813
But he must have needed it
back then.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.511
I mean, kitting right back up
after what he went through?

14:21.338 --> 14:23.558
He must have leaned hard
on the whole team.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.908
Had to have been some moments
you all had to carry him.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.041
[camera shutter clicking]

14:28.084 --> 14:29.433
Look, despite
whatever noise you heard

14:29.477 --> 14:32.001
about my time at Foxtrot,
I want you to know,

14:32.045 --> 14:34.917
I would have carried Ray, too.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.353
Do it for any teammate.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.312
What happened with Foxtrot
at the end there?

14:38.355 --> 14:40.314
I heard you and Hancock
were like water and oil, huh?

14:40.357 --> 14:43.404
[smacks lips]
Yeah, whatever our issues,

14:43.447 --> 14:45.362
they were personal,
never tactical.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.321
Right, so you saved
the tactical questions for me.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.191
Thanks.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.280
Like I said about Hamal--

14:50.324 --> 14:52.587
your team, your call.

14:56.069 --> 14:59.246
Look, what happened
to Clay, you know,

14:59.289 --> 15:02.553
with what he went through,
and any way to keep my guys

15:02.597 --> 15:04.468
out of the fire,
I'll take that.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.951
Just...
sending in Hamal was, uh,

15:08.995 --> 15:10.997
the least terrible option.

15:13.086 --> 15:15.349
Just wish it turned out better.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.569
War got that kid.

15:18.613 --> 15:22.356
Wasn't you.
And that call put us here.

15:27.317 --> 15:29.232
[camera shutter clicking]

15:29.276 --> 15:31.713
That's him.
That's Yasiri, right there.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.671
OMAR:
Holy shit.

15:34.716 --> 15:35.760
Yo, we could take him right now.

15:35.804 --> 15:38.024
[high-pitch ringing]

15:39.286 --> 15:42.115
Are there-- are there
any other enemy with him?

15:42.158 --> 15:44.726
I'm only seeing the one.
Shit, let's move.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.424
-[engine starts]
-[high-pitched ringing
continues]

15:48.425 --> 15:50.384
[echoing]: We'll pull up,
get the drop on the guard,

15:50.427 --> 15:52.690
throw Yasiri in the truck,
and we're gone.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.431
-Hold up.
-No, no, no, we gotta move.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.433
-He's gonna go back inside.
-Stop the truck.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.695
What?

16:01.351 --> 16:04.006
We've been made.
Get us the fuck outta here.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.660
No. We're clean, let's do this.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.270
JASON:
I said we're fucking made.
We're made.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.404
Get us the fuck
outta here, now.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.595
The hell happened out there?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.814
-Confirmed Yasiri's location.
-OMAR: Yeah.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.339
Asshat was right in front of us,
we had him.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.342
No shit.
Y'all move on him?

16:35.385 --> 16:36.604
Yeah, we couldn't.
Got burned.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.301
OMAR:
[scoffs] My ass, we were.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.434
Civilian saw us, ran off,

16:40.477 --> 16:43.002
set up a flag.
Had to bail.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.702
Civilian?
It was a clueless kid.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.791
We were clear.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.012
Why don't you say what
really went down out there?

16:56.058 --> 16:57.973
You don't trust me.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.584
Whether it's new-guy bullshit
or Foxtrot rumors,

17:00.628 --> 17:02.456
when it came time to execute,
you didn't think I could,

17:02.499 --> 17:04.719
and so you pulled the ripcord.
Fuck this.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.591
Shit.

17:13.510 --> 17:17.253
Well, guess that one-on-one
with Omar didn't go so well.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.648
I really thought
we were burned, Ray.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.825
HVT in your sights
and you stand down?

17:23.868 --> 17:25.435
That is a new look for you.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.353
[tapping bottle]

17:42.583 --> 17:45.151
[exhales sharply]
It's my head.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.589
It's my head.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.245
I had my sights on Yasiri,
and the whole world

17:52.288 --> 17:54.029
just dropped out
underneath me.

17:54.856 --> 17:59.165
Ringing in my skull,
vertigo, tinnitus,

17:59.208 --> 18:00.949
the whole fucking thing, man.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.256
That's textbook symptoms.

18:04.605 --> 18:07.564
I couldn't put Omar at risk
knowing I was compromised.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.697
-There's no way.
-And you couldn't tell him why,

18:09.740 --> 18:12.526
and you couldn't let him
take the lead.

18:12.569 --> 18:16.051
Yeah.
Anyone else out there with me,

18:16.095 --> 18:18.227
I would have been able
to do it, but...

18:19.489 --> 18:22.318
[exhales sharply]
Fuck.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.804
Jace, right now, bigger picture

18:29.847 --> 18:33.721
is even the people you trust,
they don't know what happened.

18:34.591 --> 18:38.856
As far as any of 'em know,
you think Omar's shaky.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.423
And if Bravo 1 thinks...

18:40.467 --> 18:42.817
Look, if we don't get
another, uh, another shot here

18:42.860 --> 18:46.342
at Yasiri, Command's gonna
start asking questions

18:46.386 --> 18:48.779
that I do not
want Omar to answer.

18:48.823 --> 18:52.000
We gotta put all of our energy
into finding this dirtbag, Ray.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.176
Jace, right now,

18:54.220 --> 18:57.048
the way you got everybody
eyeballing Omar,

18:57.092 --> 19:00.139
mission success is no guarantee.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.751
I mean, before we roll anywhere,
the rest of the team

19:03.794 --> 19:07.233
has to know that Omar
is a good piece of gear.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.546
[whispering]:
Come on, man.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.550
[sighs]

19:22.552 --> 19:26.252
So, it was just you,
the admiral, and the president?

19:26.295 --> 19:29.211
Oh, I was quaking
in my junior grade shoes.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213
Had no business being there.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.823
But the admiral
I was working for

19:32.867 --> 19:34.390
was a tremendous mentor.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.436
Oh, gosh, it's so nice to find
someone like that, ma'am.

19:36.479 --> 19:39.787
Yes. POTUS... [chuckles]
...looked at me

19:39.830 --> 19:42.964
and asked a question
he often asks of colleagues.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.836
"What keeps you up at night?"

19:48.883 --> 19:50.406
That's not rhetorical.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.930
Oh. [chuckles]

19:52.974 --> 19:55.672
Well, honestly, ma'am,

19:55.716 --> 19:58.327
lately it's worry
that the US Cramptonattack

19:58.371 --> 20:00.590
has drawn us into
yet another quagmire

20:00.634 --> 20:03.898
that necessitates high-risk,
low-impact ops.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.596
Considering the recent history
of Syria,

20:06.640 --> 20:08.772
certainly worthy
of some lost sleep.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.949
-And you?
-Oh.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.516
The stakes of it all.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.127
How failing to have a full view
of the playing field,

20:16.171 --> 20:18.347
or gauge the proper response

20:18.391 --> 20:20.523
could cause
geopolitical repercussions

20:20.567 --> 20:22.525
that last a generation or more.

20:22.569 --> 20:25.267
Well, after our lunch,
I'm trying to have a fuller view

20:25.311 --> 20:26.616
of the playing field.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.489
You were right, of course;

20:29.532 --> 20:31.404
I'll have a far bigger impact
on our committee

20:31.447 --> 20:33.928
by figuring out
how my objectives

20:33.971 --> 20:35.625
align with my colleagues.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.975
I've found it's always easier
to sell my ideas

20:38.019 --> 20:39.934
when I'm not wearing them
on my sleeve.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.762
I didn't realize
I was selling anything,

20:41.805 --> 20:44.634
just arguing for what
I feel is right.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.681
Well, a dose of Madison Avenue
won't hurt your cause,

20:47.724 --> 20:49.552
now that you got
the K Street schmoozing down,

20:49.596 --> 20:51.424
inviting me here.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.731
I'm here because
I believe in you.

20:54.775 --> 20:58.257
I know you'll fight like hell
for what you care about.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.084
I want to arm you for that.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.306
[phone chimes]

21:05.438 --> 21:07.178
I am so sorry, ma'am.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.963
I am needed back at work.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.921
Thank you for this.

21:12.749 --> 21:15.535
Go turn that insomnia
into action.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.280
This is why we normally put it
in his crib

21:21.323 --> 21:22.542
when it comes out
of the laundry.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.065
Well, we have time
to find it now

21:24.108 --> 21:25.414
while he's asleep.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.850
Well, you don't want to hear him
wake up screaming

21:26.894 --> 21:28.417
because he doesn't have
his favorite doll.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.855
-What are we searching for?
-Brian's stuffed duck.

21:31.899 --> 21:35.337
Oh-ho-ho, yeah,
no, we need to find that one.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.557
Sooner rather than later,
if possible.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.298
[Clay sighs]

21:39.341 --> 21:41.517
Is your leg hurting, babe?
You can sit, we got it.

21:41.561 --> 21:42.910
My leg is fine.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.741
There, it's between the couch
and the table there.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.612
-Ah. [hisses]
-Oh.

We can't see
around every corner.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.207
But there were signs
that the Brigade

36:06.251 --> 36:08.601
is playing on a different level
than other regional militias.

36:08.644 --> 36:10.429
Start with the fact
that they went international

36:10.472 --> 36:11.865
to hit the Crampton.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.736
It's hard to draw a line
from that to the idea

36:13.780 --> 36:16.217
that they'd have
100-million-dollar drones.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.219
Yes.
So, there's only one answer

36:18.263 --> 36:20.090
that makes any sense.

36:20.134 --> 36:23.790
They didn't have those weapons.
Someone else provided them.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.052
Who?

36:25.835 --> 36:28.360
Someone using the Brigade
as a proxy force.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.362

Russia, Turkey, Iran.

36:33.756 --> 36:36.629
If there is
a larger force at play,

36:36.672 --> 36:38.848
it's doing more
than just providing weapons.

36:38.892 --> 36:41.460

36:43.636 --> 36:45.725

that the drone strikes

were executed by the U.S.,
