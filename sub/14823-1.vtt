HOW ARE YOU?

10:23.122 --> 10:24.832
FINE.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.792
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.794
THAT WAS A DUMB QUESTION.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.963
PEOPLE EXPECT YOU
TO SAY YOU'RE "FINE,"

10:30.963 --> 10:33.007
BUT WHEN YOU DO,

10:33.007 --> 10:34.717
THEY'RE NOT
EVEN LISTENING.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.012
NEXT TIME
SOMEONE ASKS HOW YOU ARE,

10:38.012 --> 10:39.013
WHAT IF YOU
GAVE THEM AN ANSWER

10:39.013 --> 10:40.556
THAT ACTUALLY
MAKES THEM THINK?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.726
LIKE, IF YOU'RE SAD,
YOU COULD SAY,

10:43.726 --> 10:45.644
"I'M A BALLOON
WITHOUT ANY AIR IN IT."

10:45.644 --> 10:47.897
OR IF YOU'RE HAPPY,
YOU COULD SAY,

10:47.897 --> 10:50.316
"I'M A SUNNY DAY
AT THE BEACH,"

10:50.316 --> 10:51.192
WHICH IS
SELF-EXPLANATORY,

10:51.192 --> 10:52.401
BECAUSE
WHAT'S HAPPIER

10:52.401 --> 10:53.986
THAN A SUNNY DAY
AT THE BEACH?

10:53.986 --> 10:56.197
BUT THE PERSON WHO ASKS
"HOW ARE YOU"

10:56.197 --> 10:58.032
IS GONNA THINK
ABOUT YOUR ANSWER,

10:58.032 --> 11:00.409
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
SAY "I'M FINE,"

11:00.409 --> 11:01.994
LIKE THEY EXPECTED.

11:01.994 --> 11:05.539
THEY'LL HEAR YOU IN A WAY
THAT THEY NEVER HAVE BEFORE.

[BECCA]: THE WORST THING
ABOUT BEING AN ART MAJOR

GET THROUGH THIS.

01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:40.812
I'VE TAUGHT HER HOW TO HAVE FUN,

01:21:40.812 --> 01:21:43.857
AND, IRONICALLY, SHE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO BE AN ADULT,

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:47.652
BECAUSE SHE'S WISER AT NINE
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:49.112
PART OF GROWING UP

01:21:49.112 --> 01:21:52.282
MEANS LEARNING HOW TO
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.202
I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT NOW.

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.414
[EMILY]: EXCUSE ME!

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:01.833
CAN WE ASK QUESTIONS?

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:04.836
QUESTIONS ARE NORMALLY
RESERVED FOR THE END,

01:22:04.836 --> 01:22:07.088
BUT... GO FOR IT.

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:09.549
I MISS YOU,

01:22:09.549 --> 01:22:11.635
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND...

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:14.179
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING...

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:16.848
CAN WE HAVE
ANOTHER PLAY DATE?

01:22:16.848 --> 01:22:18.391
[LAUGHS]

01:22:18.391 --> 01:22:20.810
[♪♪]

01:22:24.522 --> 01:22:26.691
WE CAN HAVE
AS MANY PLAY DATES AS YOU WANT,

01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:29.319
AS LONG AS
IT'S OKAY WITH YOUR DAD.

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:32.822
IT'S OKAY BY ME.

01:22:35.825 --> 01:22:37.369
I MISSED YOU.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.329
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:42.624
[♪♪]

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.334
[APPLAUDING]

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:50.548
I'M PROUD OF YOU, GIRL.

01:22:50.548 --> 01:22:52.884
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE OPERATIVE WORD IS?

01:22:52.884 --> 01:22:54.135
"WHEW!"

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:55.970
[LAUGHING]

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.347
BYE.

01:22:57.347 --> 01:23:00.350
GREATEST THESIS
PRESENTATION EVER!

01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:03.853
-SEE YOU LATER.
-SEEYA.

01:23:04.896 --> 01:23:07.232
WELL...

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:09.693
OKAY, WELL, IF
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:11.820
WE HAVE TO BE TOTALLY
AND COMPLETELY HONEST,

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.406
AND I HAVE ONE LAST
CONFESSION TO MAKE.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:15.907
JE PARLE FRANCAIS.

01:23:15.907 --> 01:23:17.617
I'M TOTALLY FLUENT.

01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:19.911
SO I KNEW WHEN YOU GUYS
WERE TALKING ABOUT ME,

01:23:19.911 --> 01:23:21.705
I KNEW WHAT
YOU WERE SAYING,

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:23.915
AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS REALLY CUTE.

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:25.166
SO MANY DEGREES.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:26.876
SHOULD'VE KNOWN
ONE WOULD BE FRENCH.

01:23:26.876 --> 01:23:27.919
NO, ACTUALLY.

01:23:27.919 --> 01:23:29.504
"ROSETTA STONE."

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:30.672
[EMILY]:
YOU DID REALLY GOOD!

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.716
YOU THINK SO?

01:23:33.758 --> 01:23:35.176
ANYONE UP FOR A PLAY DATE?

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:37.387
[♪♪]

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.561
ICE CREAM?

01:23:45.603 --> 01:23:47.564
-FINE.
-YES!
