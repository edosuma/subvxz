LOIS:

00:10.093 --> 00:11.345
Everybody up!

00:12.930 --> 00:14.264
(screaming)

00:14.306 --> 00:15.850
Let's go! Let's go!

00:15.891 --> 00:17.392
I got to do laundry before work!

00:18.686 --> 00:20.061
I am taking breakfast

00:20.103 --> 00:21.897
off the table

00:20.103 --> 00:21.897
in five minutes!

00:21.939 --> 00:23.273
(door opens, closes)

00:23.315 --> 00:26.318
I know this kid...

00:26.360 --> 00:29.571
his  mom wakes him up

00:26.360 --> 00:29.571
with a kiss on the forehead.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.110
Okay, I've been up

01:06.608 --> 01:09.110
for half an hour.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.738
I've had my cereal.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.365
It's time for Mom to ask

01:10.779 --> 01:13.365
the same annoying question

01:13.407 --> 01:14.783
she asks me every morning.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.368
So, Malcolm,

01:14.825 --> 01:16.368
what are you doing

01:16.410 --> 01:17.912
in your genius

01:16.410 --> 01:17.912
class today?

01:17.953 --> 01:19.955
Nothing. It's just

01:17.953 --> 01:19.955
as dumb and boring

01:19.997 --> 01:23.124
as being in regular class,

01:19.997 --> 01:23.124
except now I get ostracized.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.168
Ostracized? Oh, you're

01:23.166 --> 01:25.168
learning such big words.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.336
HAL:

01:25.210 --> 01:26.336
Hey.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.838
They want to know what I think

01:27.880 --> 01:30.549
about caller I.D. blocking.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.133
Do I think about that?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.594
Oh!

01:33.635 --> 01:34.636
What?

01:34.678 --> 01:36.638
Nothing. Just a sharp Cheerio.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.848
Oh!

01:40.183 --> 01:42.811
Ha! $210!

01:42.853 --> 01:44.145
Look at all the calls

01:44.187 --> 01:45.856
that Francis is charging to us.

01:45.898 --> 01:46.941
60 minutes. Oh!

01:46.982 --> 01:48.149
Oh, 80 minutes--

01:46.982 --> 01:48.149
and every one

01:48.191 --> 01:50.151
of these calls is to Beebee.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.154
$210 on Beebee!

01:53.196 --> 01:54.531
I know. Now, honey,

01:54.573 --> 01:56.033
just try to understand,

01:54.573 --> 01:56.033
all right?

01:56.075 --> 01:57.367
He's-he's off in Alabama.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.787
He's all by himself

01:57.409 --> 01:59.787
at military school.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.581
He's lonely, so... so he calls

01:59.828 --> 02:02.581
his little girlfriend.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.375
She's a tramp.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.375
No one's saying

02:02.623 --> 02:05.375
she's not a tramp.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.752
I thought you changed

02:05.417 --> 02:06.752
our code number.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.169
I have, three times.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.755
I-I don't know

02:08.211 --> 02:09.755
how he's getting it.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.257
65519.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.260
That'll be good till

02:12.299 --> 02:15.260
the bill comes on the 15th.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.930
Thanks, man.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.930
You are a good brother.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.349
I was taking money

02:19.222 --> 02:21.349
out of her wallet anyway.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.684
LOIS:

02:21.391 --> 02:22.684
He is doing this

02:22.726 --> 02:25.186
just to upset me.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.480
Oh, come on, Lois.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.774
He's 16

02:26.521 --> 02:28.774
and thinks he's in love.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.443
What are you going to do?

02:31.485 --> 02:34.195
Oh, man, never ask her that.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.615
Beebee, you can't imagine

02:34.237 --> 02:36.615
how much I miss you.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.243
It is like a white-hot fire

02:36.657 --> 02:40.243
burning in my chest.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.370
The only thing

02:40.285 --> 02:42.370
that keeps me going

02:42.412 --> 02:44.205
is just the thought

02:42.412 --> 02:44.205
of holding you

02:44.247 --> 02:45.707
and stroking your hair

02:45.749 --> 02:48.251
and being with you

02:45.749 --> 02:48.251
in a perfect, golden moment.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.878
(TV playing)

02:48.293 --> 02:49.878
Oh, yeah.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.421
I'm totally the same way.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.215
Oh, I'm just so...

02:54.257 --> 02:55.509
Are you watching  Buffy?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.678
I can do both.

02:57.719 --> 03:01.264
You know, I think of things,

02:57.719 --> 03:01.264
too, like...

03:01.306 --> 03:03.266
no, it's too embarrassing.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.309
Tell me.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.394
It's not the kind of thing

03:06.436 --> 03:08.271
you can say over the phone.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.066
It's something

03:08.313 --> 03:11.066
I'd have to show you.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.609
Beebee, I think

03:11.108 --> 03:12.609
it would be better

03:12.651 --> 03:16.030
if you told me

03:12.651 --> 03:16.030
and then you showed me.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.405
Stanley, what are you doing?!

03:17.447 --> 03:19.158
That was Beebee!

03:22.285 --> 03:23.411
Sorry, man.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.246
Commandant says

03:23.453 --> 03:25.246
your phone privileges

03:25.288 --> 03:26.498
have been revoked

03:25.288 --> 03:26.498
for a month.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.333
Your mom complained

03:26.540 --> 03:28.333
about the bills.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.960
Okay, let me just tell her...

03:30.002 --> 03:33.254
Francis, do you remember

03:30.002 --> 03:33.254
the thumb thing?

03:33.296 --> 03:35.132
The one you did to my thumb

03:35.174 --> 03:37.801
or the one you did

03:35.174 --> 03:37.801
with your thumb?

03:41.930 --> 03:44.141
(phone rings)

03:44.183 --> 03:46.101
Hello.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.101
Malcolm! Thank God.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.478
Look, I don't have any more

03:46.143 --> 03:48.478
quarters, so just listen.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.313
I need you

03:48.520 --> 03:50.313
to swipe Mom's credit card

03:50.355 --> 03:51.982
and I need you

03:50.355 --> 03:51.982
to buy me a cell phone.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.692
Now, what you want to get is

03:53.734 --> 03:56.277
the unlimited off-peak plan,

03:53.734 --> 03:56.277
and then FedEx it to me.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.279
Francis, no. I can't do that.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.740
What?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.700
Dude, don't bail on me.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.161
I'm sorry, but Mom

04:01.742 --> 04:04.161
is totally on the warpath

04:04.203 --> 04:05.370
about the phone calls.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.997
Her radar is up. I can't do

04:07.039 --> 04:08.248
anything.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.753
Seriously, you just got

04:10.333 --> 04:12.753
to find a way to live

04:12.794 --> 04:14.588
without calling Beebee

04:12.794 --> 04:14.588
all the time.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.508
Hello?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.468
(Francis screams)

04:20.510 --> 04:21.803
Hello?

04:21.845 --> 04:24.347
(dial tone humming)

04:24.389 --> 04:27.226
He understands, right?

04:29.561 --> 04:32.731
FRANCIS:

04:29.561 --> 04:32.731
Dearest Beebee, something

04:29.561 --> 04:32.731
wonderful has happened.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.525
The pain and confusion

04:32.773 --> 04:35.525
of the last few months

04:35.567 --> 04:38.237
has disappeared,

04:35.567 --> 04:38.237
replaced by a single

04:38.278 --> 04:40.321
glorious purpose.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.783
(screams)

04:40.363 --> 04:42.783
(laughs, whoops)

04:45.202 --> 04:48.622
From the ashes of the old

04:45.202 --> 04:48.622
Francis rises a new man,

04:48.663 --> 04:52.292
filled with boldness

04:48.663 --> 04:52.292
and determination.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.342
I fly to you on angel's wings,

05:01.384 --> 05:04.304
knowing I follow

05:01.384 --> 05:04.304
the mandate of my heart.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.062
(shrill screaming)

05:12.104 --> 05:13.730
(groans)

05:13.772 --> 05:16.608
Every night

05:13.772 --> 05:16.608
for the past two weeks,

05:16.650 --> 05:18.944
he thinks there's a monster

05:16.650 --> 05:18.944
under the bed.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.363
It seemed so funny

05:18.986 --> 05:22.363
when we thought of it.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.365
Oh, sweetie, not again.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.367
The monster!

05:26.409 --> 05:28.369
It tried to suck

05:26.409 --> 05:28.369
my brain out!

05:28.411 --> 05:30.580
All right, I have had it.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.082
You two are banned

05:30.622 --> 05:32.082
from Nintendo.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.374
Okay.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.169
We're already banned

05:33.416 --> 05:35.169
from Nintendo.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.379
The sad thing is he thinks

05:35.210 --> 05:38.379
he just outsmarted her.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.174
All right, fine.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.216
Pillows.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.383
What?

05:42.425 --> 05:43.885
That's right.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.885
I'm taking your pillows.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.846
Come on, come on, hand 'em over.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.389
And I'm not getting up again.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.017
If that monster wants

05:48.431 --> 05:50.017
to suck out your brain,

05:50.058 --> 05:52.351
you just let him take it

05:50.058 --> 05:52.351
and you go back to sleep.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.152
I love you.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.487
I love you.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.489
I love you.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.411
(distorted):

06:08.743 --> 06:10.411
I love you.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.371
(toy's voice fading)

06:41.776 --> 06:43.862
Hello?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.240
Don't scream.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.240
It's me.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.116
(grunts)

06:48.158 --> 06:49.743
Francis!

06:49.784 --> 06:51.119
Way to go, dipwad.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.996
You got me in the nards.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.127
Francis, what are you

06:57.751 --> 06:59.127
doing here?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.171
I'm taking control

06:59.169 --> 07:01.171
of my own destiny.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.923
I'm just here to pick up

07:01.213 --> 07:02.923
Beebee, and then we're

07:02.964 --> 07:04.049
going to head off for Canada.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.343
You're going to visit Grandma?

07:06.385 --> 07:07.928
No, a different part of Canada.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.764
Someplace wild where people

07:07.969 --> 07:10.764
don't have to destroy love

07:10.805 --> 07:12.974
just 'cause they don't

07:10.805 --> 07:12.974
understand it.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.726
You just ran away from school?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.937
Mom's really going

07:14.768 --> 07:16.937
to kill you now.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.064
No, she won't,

07:16.978 --> 07:19.064
because she won't know.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
Malcolm, you can't

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
tell anybody.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.484
I'm placing my life

07:20.982 --> 07:23.484
in your hands here.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.987
Did you roll around

07:23.526 --> 07:25.987
in something?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.781
You'll get used to it.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.324
Look, I need you

07:27.822 --> 07:29.324
to get Beebee

07:29.366 --> 07:30.491
to come see me

07:29.366 --> 07:30.491
tonight, okay?

07:30.533 --> 07:31.743
Give her this.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.578
Let it air out

07:31.785 --> 07:33.578
for a while first.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.538
Try to get me some food,

07:35.580 --> 07:38.417
'cause I haven't eaten

07:35.580 --> 07:38.417
in, like, 36 hours.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.668
Francis, this sounds kind

07:38.458 --> 07:40.668
of drastic, even for you.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.004
Malcolm, I do not have

07:40.710 --> 07:43.004
time for doubt!

07:43.046 --> 07:45.506
The die has been cast,

07:43.046 --> 07:45.506
my future is set.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.384
Now, there's one

07:45.548 --> 07:47.384
question in my mind:

07:47.426 --> 07:48.509
can I trust you?

07:48.551 --> 07:49.510
But...

07:49.552 --> 07:50.887
Can I trust you?

07:50.929 --> 07:53.432
Yes.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.016
Yeah, definitely.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.229
I'll toss my lunch bag

07:56.810 --> 07:59.229
over the fence before school.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.358
Oh!

08:03.400 --> 08:04.859
(grunts)

08:06.611 --> 08:08.447
Mmm!

08:23.462 --> 08:25.839
Can I have some?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.548
Can't.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.468
It's a...

08:29.509 --> 08:32.053
prescription... sandwich.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.430
"Prescription sandwich"?

08:33.472 --> 08:35.349
Stevie, that's not

08:33.472 --> 08:35.349
even a good lie.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.600
If you don't want to

08:35.390 --> 08:37.600
share, just say so.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.559
Don't want...

08:38.601 --> 08:39.602
to share.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.605
Let's play

08:42.647 --> 08:43.564
Ironside.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.026
I'll be... Ironside.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.195
I don't want to play

08:46.067 --> 08:48.195
stupid  Ironside.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.571
What's your... problem?

08:50.613 --> 08:51.781
It's my brother Francis.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.574
He escaped from

08:51.823 --> 08:53.574
military school

08:53.616 --> 08:55.452
and hitchhiked

08:53.616 --> 08:55.452
all the way here.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.455
And he's all scraped up and

08:55.494 --> 08:58.455
smelly and hungry and dirty,

08:58.497 --> 09:00.581
and now he's hiding

08:58.497 --> 09:00.581
out at the creek.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.876
If my parents catch

09:00.623 --> 09:02.876
him, he's dead.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.752
He's talking like

09:02.917 --> 09:04.752
he's crazy.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.172
I don't know what to do.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.632
Squeal.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.842
What?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.093
Squeal.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.388
Rat him out.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.596
I can't do that.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.057
He's my brother.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.433
I promised him.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.310
I can't tell anybody.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.854
You told... me.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.647
Yeah, but by the time

09:22.896 --> 09:24.647
you tell anyone,

09:24.689 --> 09:26.233
he'll be a thousand

09:24.689 --> 09:26.233
miles from here.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.444
Tou... ché.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.492
Beebee?

09:35.534 --> 09:36.493
What?

09:36.535 --> 09:38.619
Oh, you're, uh, that kid.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.996
My name's Malcolm.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.456
I'm Francis's brother.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.417
You met me, like,

09:41.498 --> 09:43.417
ten times.

09:43.458 --> 09:47.128
Yeah, you're the freaky

09:43.458 --> 09:47.128
little brain, right?

09:48.922 --> 09:49.881
Just be cool.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.091
What do you want?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.633
Here.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.010
Francis is back home.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.263
Well, he's not home.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.263
He's hiding.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.639
Huh. Three pages?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.559
Both sides.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.643
He loves to make me read.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.438
What's that word?

10:04.479 --> 10:05.688
"Consummate."

10:06.856 --> 10:08.649
It means he likes you.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.610
Oh.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.657
"Assignation,

10:13.280 --> 10:16.657
rendezvous, tryst"?

10:16.699 --> 10:19.494
How the hell is anyone supposed

10:16.699 --> 10:19.494
to know what he's talking about?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.662
Beebee, just meet him at

10:19.536 --> 10:21.662
the creek at 7:30, okay?

10:21.704 --> 10:25.833
See? You can say it in English,

10:21.704 --> 10:25.833
and you're, like, ten.

10:25.875 --> 10:26.960
What are you doing?!

10:27.001 --> 10:28.253
I'm wearing a tank top.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.670
Beebee, I don't...

10:29.712 --> 10:30.713
Don't think.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.382
Just walk. Go.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.646
The worst part is, I think

10:43.226 --> 10:46.646
I'm stealing panty liners.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.066
Gosh, I had such

10:47.772 --> 10:50.066
a good day at work today.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.692
I got to work

10:50.108 --> 10:51.692
the cash-only line

10:51.734 --> 10:53.111
for the first time

10:51.734 --> 10:53.111
in a month,

10:53.153 --> 10:55.280
and my register

10:53.153 --> 10:55.280
came out to the penny.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.574
Plus, that creepy new

10:55.322 --> 10:57.574
assistant manager

10:57.616 --> 10:59.700
sliced his hand open

10:57.616 --> 10:59.700
with a box cutter.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.579
Spent the whole afternoon

10:59.742 --> 11:02.579
in the emergency room.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.165
Here's to him.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.708
Honey, this chicken

11:05.206 --> 11:07.708
is absolutely delicious.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.128
Oh, well, it's a little recipe

11:07.750 --> 11:10.128
I came up with.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.130
It's Shake n' Bake--

11:10.170 --> 11:12.130
but for pork.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.007
How about that?

11:14.048 --> 11:17.427
That's one for the recipe box.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.928
Let's call it, uh, "chork."

11:18.970 --> 11:20.679
All in favor?

11:21.598 --> 11:23.391
No one for "picken"?

11:23.433 --> 11:24.518
Chork it is.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.726
Brava.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.521
Oh, cut it out.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.564
You big talker.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.737
DEWEY:

11:35.236 --> 11:36.737
Will this make me

11:36.779 --> 11:38.657
taste better to the monsters?

11:38.697 --> 11:40.659
Sure it will, son.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.663
Get out of here!

11:42.785 --> 11:44.663
You're not eating it.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.747
You haven't had a bite in

11:44.703 --> 11:46.747
two minutes, I counted.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.748
I'm saving it.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.668
There is no saving.

11:49.708 --> 11:50.751
Malcolm, he's right.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.711
The rule is: no saving.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.257
Oh, yeah, I care.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.257
Cut it out!

11:56.299 --> 11:57.758
(phone ringing)

11:56.299 --> 11:57.758
Come on, it's mine.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.010
Get out of here!

11:57.800 --> 11:59.010
No!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.595
Give it back!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.595
Boys, boys, stop it.

12:00.637 --> 12:01.804
You're going get

12:00.637 --> 12:01.804
your mother out of...

12:01.846 --> 12:04.182
uh, you're going to ruin

12:01.846 --> 12:04.182
her nice day.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.766
Francis did what?!

12:09.396 --> 12:12.065
Another night in the chat room.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.572
That kid! That kid!

12:18.613 --> 12:20.156
He thinks he can just

12:18.613 --> 12:20.156
run away from school

12:20.198 --> 12:21.575
like some-some kind

12:20.198 --> 12:21.575
of escaped convict?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.159
Well, if he thinks

12:21.616 --> 12:23.159
he can just vanish

12:23.201 --> 12:25.078
in the night

12:23.201 --> 12:25.078
and I won't find him,

12:25.119 --> 12:26.787
well, he is sadly mistaken.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.872
Lois, you just calm down.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.957
There's nothing

12:27.914 --> 12:29.957
we can do right now.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.959
Yes, there is.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.959
I can call the police.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.794
No, they're not going

12:32.001 --> 12:33.794
to look for anybody

12:33.836 --> 12:35.796
unless they've been missing

12:33.836 --> 12:35.796
for 48 hours.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.798
Not if I say he has

12:35.838 --> 12:37.798
drugs on him.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.300
Lois, stop it.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.219
Now, you're just going

12:39.342 --> 12:41.219
to have to accept the fact

12:41.261 --> 12:43.221
that for now, this is

12:41.261 --> 12:43.221
beyond your control.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.473
Francis is going to have

12:43.263 --> 12:45.473
to sink or swim on his own,

12:45.515 --> 12:48.476
and frankly, I don't think

12:45.515 --> 12:48.476
that's such a bad thing.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.312
And in the meantime, we just

12:48.518 --> 12:51.312
have to leave it up to fate.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.231
Oh. "Fate."

12:53.273 --> 12:56.025
"Fate" is just what you call it

12:53.273 --> 12:56.025
when you don't know the name

12:56.067 --> 12:58.319
of the person

12:56.067 --> 12:58.319
screwing you over!

13:02.865 --> 13:05.702
Mom, I'm sure he's okay.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.664
Uh-oh, tactical error.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.750
Why do you think he's okay, son?

13:11.790 --> 13:14.877
Because...

13:11.790 --> 13:14.877
he's always okay.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.838
Malcolm,

13:17.880 --> 13:19.840
this is a very serious

13:17.880 --> 13:19.840
situation here,

13:19.882 --> 13:22.719
and, well, I know you love

13:19.882 --> 13:22.719
Francis as much as we do,

13:22.761 --> 13:23.844
so if you have

13:23.886 --> 13:25.305
any idea...

13:25.346 --> 13:27.848
Oh, for God's sake!

13:25.346 --> 13:27.848
Where is he?!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.517
He came here to see Beebee!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.517
He's meeting her tonight!

13:29.559 --> 13:31.311
Oh, my God,

13:29.559 --> 13:31.311
how'd she do that?

13:31.352 --> 13:32.353
I knew it.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.854
When did you talk to him?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.148
Don't look at her eyes,

13:33.896 --> 13:35.148
don't look at her...

13:35.189 --> 13:36.483
This morning!

13:36.524 --> 13:39.736
And Dewey shoved a

13:36.524 --> 13:39.736
sandwich in the VCR!

13:39.778 --> 13:40.861
Malcolm, where is he?

13:40.903 --> 13:42.155
(quietly):

13:40.903 --> 13:42.155
Got to think.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.114
Diversion. Delancey.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.449
Delancey Park!

13:44.491 --> 13:45.784
He's meeting her

13:44.491 --> 13:45.784
at Delancey Park

13:45.824 --> 13:47.826
by the soccer field.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.748
Well...

13:51.790 --> 13:55.834
we'll just see what fate

13:51.790 --> 13:55.834
has in store for Francis.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.723
Francis, I have

14:06.179 --> 14:08.723
to tell you...

14:08.765 --> 14:10.891
Is Beebee coming?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.891
Yeah.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.186
But I have to tell you

14:10.933 --> 14:13.186
something first.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.896
I ratted you out to Mom.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.896
What?!

14:15.938 --> 14:17.148
I didn't mean to.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.899
Mom did... her eyes.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.109
And her voice, it was...

14:20.151 --> 14:21.611
I didn't mean to!

14:21.653 --> 14:24.071
Malcolm, how could you do that?

14:21.653 --> 14:24.071
I trusted you.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.699
I know.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.408
I'm sorry.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.160
Look, I sent her to the park.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.911
You've got an hour

14:29.202 --> 14:30.911
to get out of here

14:30.953 --> 14:31.954
and have a head start

14:30.953 --> 14:31.954
before she...

14:31.996 --> 14:33.914
Are you crazy?

14:31.996 --> 14:33.914
I can't go anywhere.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.958
Beebee's coming. Beebee.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.712
Francis, what's wrong with you?

14:38.753 --> 14:40.797
Why are you getting

14:38.753 --> 14:40.797
in so much trouble for her?

14:40.839 --> 14:41.756
You don't understand.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.924
Duh! No one understands.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.926
She's not nice,

14:43.966 --> 14:45.926
she's not smart,

14:45.968 --> 14:48.429
she's a thief, she's not even

14:45.968 --> 14:48.429
that good-looking.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.930
And, oh, guess what else.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.391
She treats you like crap!

14:51.432 --> 14:52.517
I know.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.310
You do?

14:54.352 --> 14:56.937
Of course I do.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
There's something

14:56.979 --> 14:58.939
you don't know about Beebee.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.900
What?

15:01.984 --> 15:04.779
That no one in her whole life

15:04.821 --> 15:07.114
has ever loved her

15:04.821 --> 15:07.114
the way that I do.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.784
All she has to do is see that

15:07.156 --> 15:09.784
and everything will change.

15:09.826 --> 15:13.329
I really thought he had

15:09.826 --> 15:13.329
something better.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.164
Look, Malcolm, you'll

15:13.371 --> 15:15.164
understand when you're older.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.417
Now, just go.

15:21.921 --> 15:22.963
What were you doing?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.965
Nothing.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.965
Mind your own business.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.968
Who were you talking to?

15:28.010 --> 15:30.680
I wasn't talking to anybody.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.680
You're imagining it.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.306
I heard you talking.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.394
Okay, I'll tell you.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.479
But you have to

15:36.436 --> 15:38.479
keep it a secret.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.440
You know the monster

15:38.521 --> 15:40.440
under your bed?

15:41.733 --> 15:42.983
It's called a Sasquatch.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.611
He hunts back there

15:43.025 --> 15:44.611
during the day.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.986
I was throwing him

15:44.652 --> 15:45.986
some raw meat

15:46.028 --> 15:47.697
so he wouldn't

15:46.028 --> 15:47.697
come get us tonight.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.283
I don't think

15:47.739 --> 15:50.283
I gave him enough.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.827
So, if I were you,

15:50.324 --> 15:52.827
I'd keep very quiet

15:52.869 --> 15:54.788
and stay the hell out of there.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.248
Get it?

16:10.678 --> 16:12.972
Move!

16:19.520 --> 16:21.731
BEEBEE:

16:19.520 --> 16:21.731
Francis?

16:25.944 --> 16:27.069
Beebee?

16:27.111 --> 16:28.321
Francis?

16:28.362 --> 16:29.322
Oh. Don't move.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.407
I want to remember this forever.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.700
Where are you?

16:32.742 --> 16:35.035
No! Don't look at me!

16:35.077 --> 16:37.037
I wanted so much

16:35.077 --> 16:37.037
to be perfect for you,

16:37.079 --> 16:39.415
but I couldn't find any soap.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.834
I'm hideous.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.627
Really?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.627
Yes.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.504
But it's okay.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.047
Everything is okay

16:44.545 --> 16:47.047
now that we're together.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.259
I can't tell you how beautiful

16:47.089 --> 16:50.259
you look at this moment.

16:50.301 --> 16:53.638
You look like an angel

16:50.301 --> 16:53.638
or a perfect dawn

16:53.680 --> 16:55.306
or a galaxy of stars.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.767
I don't think we should

16:55.348 --> 16:57.767
see each other anymore.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.105
And... my heart soars

17:00.102 --> 17:03.105
when I think of...

17:03.147 --> 17:04.565
Did you hear what I said?

17:05.358 --> 17:08.444
I... um...

17:08.486 --> 17:09.904
What?

17:09.946 --> 17:10.947
Look...

17:10.989 --> 17:12.699
you're a nice guy,

17:12.740 --> 17:15.493
and all those letters you sent--

17:12.740 --> 17:15.493
the stuff I understood, anyway--

17:15.535 --> 17:17.745
was sweet, but I don't know.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.080
Feels different now.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.000
It's hard to explain.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.377
Would you try?

17:24.418 --> 17:26.754
Well, maybe I just like

17:24.418 --> 17:26.754
the long-distance thing

17:26.796 --> 17:29.549
'cause, you know,

17:26.796 --> 17:29.549
you'd call and you'd talk

17:29.590 --> 17:31.926
and you'd make me feel

17:29.590 --> 17:31.926
so good about myself

17:31.968 --> 17:34.512
and I didn't have

17:31.968 --> 17:34.512
to do anything.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.096
Yeah, that's it.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.098
Beebee, please.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.976
I just think it's better

17:38.140 --> 17:39.976
we end it now

17:40.018 --> 17:41.310
before anybody gets hurt.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.524
I'm sorry, Francis.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.238
Ow.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.241
Ow!

17:56.158 --> 17:58.077
Ow!

17:59.161 --> 18:01.080
Ow!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.082
(yelling)

18:05.167 --> 18:07.086
(yelling continues)

18:08.379 --> 18:09.923
Get out of here!

18:09.964 --> 18:12.717
You stupid, dumb monster!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.385
(sobbing)

18:12.759 --> 18:14.385
This is my house!

18:14.427 --> 18:16.637
Ow.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.637
Go away!

18:16.679 --> 18:17.722
Ow!

18:17.764 --> 18:18.848
You leave me alone!

18:18.890 --> 18:20.558
Ow! Ow!

18:30.068 --> 18:32.152
You! You, there!

18:32.194 --> 18:33.320
What do you think

18:32.194 --> 18:33.320
you're doing?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.948
Excuse me?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.323
Do you know how dumb

18:34.989 --> 18:36.323
and careless you're being?

18:36.365 --> 18:38.158
Well, I brought...

18:38.200 --> 18:39.994
Oh, for God's sake,

18:38.200 --> 18:39.994
I'm not talking about that.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.370
But shame on you.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.205
Don't you know

18:41.412 --> 18:43.205
how this is all going to end?

18:43.247 --> 18:45.083
Do we know you?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.834
No, but I know you.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.168
You're young and pretty

18:48.210 --> 18:50.088
and you love to get

18:48.210 --> 18:50.088
16-year-old boys so twisted up

18:50.129 --> 18:51.881
they don't know

18:50.129 --> 18:51.881
what they're doing.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.340
And you think it's all in fun.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.340
You'll move on.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.842
You don't care

18:53.382 --> 18:54.842
how bad you hurt him.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.552
Let me tell you something,

18:54.884 --> 18:56.552
young lady.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.178
Hearts are precious things.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.264
You should be careful with them.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.644
You!

19:04.685 --> 19:05.979
You there!

19:06.020 --> 19:07.772
What do you think

19:06.020 --> 19:07.772
you're doing?!

19:07.814 --> 19:09.690
And then the monster

19:07.814 --> 19:09.690
started growling at me,

19:09.732 --> 19:11.275
so I threw rocks at him

19:09.732 --> 19:11.275
and I killed him.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.652
And then he started flying

19:11.317 --> 19:12.652
around on rocket boots,

19:12.693 --> 19:14.487
and I got to ride

19:12.693 --> 19:14.487
inside his head,

19:14.528 --> 19:16.572
and now the monster's my friend,

19:14.528 --> 19:16.572
and we went...

19:16.614 --> 19:18.198
and we went to get Slurpees.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.200
You did not!

19:18.240 --> 19:20.200
You're just lying!

19:20.242 --> 19:21.702
Reese, if that's what

19:20.242 --> 19:21.702
Dewey says happened,

19:21.744 --> 19:23.704
there's no reason

19:21.744 --> 19:23.704
to argue about it.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.206
No one believes I beat the

19:23.746 --> 19:26.206
last level of  Mortal Kombat.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.917
Because that's just ridiculous.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.418
No one beats Sub-Zero.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.300
Leave it off.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.222
So, Beebee broke up with me.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.224
Oh.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.518
You okay?

19:45.559 --> 19:47.478
I think I'm fine.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.397
There's a strange sense

19:47.520 --> 19:50.397
of peace that comes over you

19:50.439 --> 19:53.233
when you give up

19:50.439 --> 19:53.233
that last shred of dignity.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.235
It's nice.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.071
I'm really sorry.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.282
Well, if you're going

19:57.113 --> 20:00.282
to love women,

20:00.324 --> 20:02.869
you have to expect

20:00.324 --> 20:02.869
the occasional flaming wipeout.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.244
It's in the fine print,

20:04.286 --> 20:06.706
but you agree to it

20:04.286 --> 20:06.706
when you sign up.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.167
So what are you

20:06.747 --> 20:09.167
going to do?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.835
I'm going to go

20:09.208 --> 20:10.835
back to school.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.253
I only missed a day,

20:10.877 --> 20:13.253
so it shouldn't be too bad.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.714
There's a pack of farm girls

20:14.755 --> 20:17.133
that hang around

20:14.755 --> 20:17.133
outside the fence.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.552
Probably check that out.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.845
Later days.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.304
Wait.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.931
I'm sorry I ratted you out.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.058
I just got scared.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.059
Dude, it's ancient history.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.267
Don't worry about it.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.937
Well, can't you at least

20:27.309 --> 20:29.937
hit me or something,

20:29.979 --> 20:31.647
just so I feel like we're even?

20:31.689 --> 20:33.273
You want me to hit you?

20:33.315 --> 20:35.693
I don't know. Yeah.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.570
Okay.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.949
Thanks.

20:41.991 --> 20:42.992
Psych.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.077
Ow!

20:44.118 --> 20:45.828

probably rethink the whole

"trusting him with
