02:55.560 --> 02:56.709
- Move!
- Move it!

02:56.760 --> 02:57.795
Move!

02:59.080 --> 03:00.115
Move!

03:00.400 --> 03:01.435
Now!

03:30.080 --> 03:31.007
It's me
home.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.878
- Bye, Bruno!
- Bye, Bruno!

03:57.680 --> 04:00.399
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Mum, what's going on?

04:01.160 --> 04:03.390
- We're celebrating.
- Celebrating?

04:03.440 --> 04:05.351
Your father's been given a promotion.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.278
- That means a better job.
- I know what promotion is.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.151
So we're having a little party
to celebrate.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.475
He's still going to be a soldier though,
isn't he?

04:12.520 --> 04:16.228
Yes, my lamb.
Yes, just a more important one now.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.036
There's some even more exciting news,

04:19.079 --> 04:22.436
but I think Dad wanted
to tell you about that himself.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.236
- Moving? Where to?
- To the countryside.

04:27.880 --> 04:32.032
That's miles away.
What about Karl and Leon and Martin?

04:32.080 --> 04:33.513
Sweetheart, I know it's hard,

04:33.560 --> 04:37.030
but we're all having to say goodbye
to our friends for the time being.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.548
Anyway, we'll make new ones
where we're going. Won't we?

04:39.600 --> 04:42.751
Of course you are.
You'll make lots of new friends.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.475
Bruno, you can have your friends
around in the morning before we go.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.990
Think of it as an adventure,
like in one of your books.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.029
But this is the best house ever.

04:54.600 --> 04:58.149
Well, you never know. The house
we're going to might be even better.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.236
Dad says it's got a garden.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.999
Look, the thing is, Bruno,
the thing about being a soldier,

05:06.040 --> 05:09.112
is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty,

05:09.160 --> 05:12.197
so if your country needs
you to go somewhere, you go.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.437
Now, of course, going somewhere else
is much easier

05:15.480 --> 05:19.234
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.593
Bruno! You're getting bigger
every time I see you.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.710
It's only been a week, Nathalie.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.638
Well, perhaps it's me
that's getting smaller.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.873
So, you two,

06:11.920 --> 06:14.753
well, what do you think of all this?
Moving out of Berlin?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.871
Well, Mummy and Daddy say
it's a good thing,

06:16.920 --> 06:18.831
so I suppose it must be.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.836
Children, be angels, will you?
Pass some food around.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.838
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

07:06.840 --> 07:08.432
Congratulations.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.910
- Doesn't he look wonderful?
- Absolutely.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.955
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.713
Oh, dear. I sometimes wonder
if this is all down to me,

07:20.760 --> 07:24.878
making you those costumes
for your little plays when you were tiny.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.595
- You used to adore all that dressing up.
- Nathalie...

07:28.640 --> 07:31.712
Does it still make you feel special,
Ralf dear?

07:32.280 --> 07:35.113
The uniform and what it stands for?

07:35.160 --> 07:38.789
Mother, it's a party.
Let's not spoil things.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.236
Me, spoil things?

07:42.840 --> 07:44.592
You should be careful.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.712
Airing your views so publicly
could land you in trouble.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.193
You know that.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.237
So, how long are we losing you for,
my boy?

07:54.840 --> 07:59.550
- Until the war is won, I would think.
- Well, not so long then.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.508
Bruno!

09:11.680 --> 09:14.911
All right, Bruno. Time to say goodbye.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.231
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye!

10:16.800 --> 10:20.509
"Time has come for me to sleep
Lord, I thank Thee for Thy keep

10:20.560 --> 10:23.870
"Watch this night well over me
And teach me, Lord, to trust in Thee

10:23.920 --> 10:27.276
"Care for children, sick and poor
Grant them, Lord, Thy blessing more

10:27.320 --> 10:30.676
"And this I pray in Jesus' name
Care for my family just the same"

10:30.720 --> 10:31.755
Amen.

11:14.560 --> 11:18.599
Children, look. Look! Our new home.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.149
I have some business to take care of.
I'll see you shortly.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.236
Well, what do we think?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.036
Come on. It's lovely.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.436
You two choose your rooms.
I'll have Maria come

12:37.240 --> 12:38.832
and help you unpack.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.830
What do you think of it, Maria?
The new house.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.671
It's not for me to say.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.678
But it won't feel like home
until we make it feel like home, will it?

13:12.840 --> 13:14.478
Is he already up?

13:19.440 --> 13:20.919
Who was that?

13:20.960 --> 13:23.520
One of your father's soldiers,
I suppose.

13:23.560 --> 13:27.519
- He looked very serious.
- Well, they are, aren't they?

13:31.480 --> 13:35.473
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't know.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.075
- And play with who?
- The children over on the farm.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.078
Farm? I didn't see a farm.
And that one, too.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.395
You can only see it from my room.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.677
And there are some children there?

14:20.720 --> 14:23.473
- Yes, quite a few.
- That's good.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.479
- So, I'll be able to play with them.
- I don't see why not.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.308
I'll wait a little bit,
just to see what they're like,

14:31.360 --> 14:34.557
- because they look a bit strange.
- The children do?

14:35.040 --> 14:38.112
- Well, and the farmers.
- What sort of strange?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.073
I'm sorry.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.439
Vegetables.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.869
There.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.718
Bruno, have you unpacked everything?

14:54.760 --> 14:58.309
Because I think you should
go back upstairs and finish off.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.998
Thank you, ma'am.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.149
Bruno.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.790
- I told you they were strange.
- Who?

15:09.840 --> 15:12.673
The farmers. They wear pyjamas.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.079
Bruno, I was just
coming to look for you.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.436
Well, thank you for that.
That was extremely useful.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.870
- I'll be over to see you later.
- Of course, <i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

15:38.080 --> 15:39.308
Come in.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.398
Sit down, sit down.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.431
Well, what do you think?

15:50.400 --> 15:51.628
Oh, dear.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.912
I want to go home.

15:55.600 --> 15:59.388
You are home, Bruno.
Home is where the family is.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.032
Isn't that right?

16:03.040 --> 16:07.033
Bruno, you have to at least
give the place a chance.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.718
I promise you,
it won't be long before you...

16:08.760 --> 16:13.231
Why do the farmers wear pyjamas?
I can see them from my window.

16:21.760 --> 16:26.072
The thing is, Bruno, those people...

16:26.760 --> 16:29.752
Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.433
Bruno, who told you it was a farm?

16:36.480 --> 16:38.755
- Was it Maria?
- No.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.677
It is a farm, isn't it?

16:42.240 --> 16:43.275
Yes.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.829
Is it to do with your new job?

16:47.880 --> 16:50.553
All you need to know
about my work here, Bruno,

16:50.600 --> 16:54.275
is that it's very important
to our country and to you.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.349
We're working very hard
to make this world a better place

16:57.400 --> 16:58.628
for you to grow up in.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.638
But you're not a farmer.
You're a soldier.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.830
Bruno, can you come and help me
finish sorting out in the kitchen?

17:04.880 --> 17:08.429
I can still play with them, though?
The children.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.589
I don't think so, Bruno. No.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.030
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit...

17:15.079 --> 17:16.991
Well, they're different.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.108
Don't worry, my darling.
We'll find you some new friends,

17:20.160 --> 17:22.799
but they won't be the ones
from the farm.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.309
Ralf, you promised.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.714
- You said it was miles away.
- It is.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.149
How was I to know he could see it
from the bedroom window?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.714
There was one of them in our kitchen.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.999
- Master Bruno, how are you today?
- Fed up.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.193
You said the same thing
every day for two whole weeks.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.152
- It's true.
- Well, you should be out playing.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.272
- Playing with who?
- I don't know. Gretel?

18:25.560 --> 18:30.236
- Well, you can make your own fun.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.474
One thing's for sure,

18:31.520 --> 18:35.195
sitting around being miserable
won't make things any happier.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.033
- Bruno, what are you doing?
- Exploring!

19:28.080 --> 19:31.197
No! No, not in the back.
I told you, it's out of bounds.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.118
- Explore at the front.
- But I've explored it all.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.993
- Well, find something else to do.
- Like what?

19:37.800 --> 19:40.837
Come back in now,
and we'll think of something.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.071
So, children,
what are you doing today?

20:10.120 --> 20:12.315
- Same as yesterday.
- And what was that?

20:12.360 --> 20:15.591
- Same as the day before.
- Except you went exploring.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.194
- I like exploring.
- Where did you go?

20:19.240 --> 20:22.915
I wanted to look in the back garden,
but Mum wouldn't let me.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.592
The back garden?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.838
Well, God forbid.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.836
I expect you'll be missing
those friends of yours.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.472
I even miss school.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.198
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

20:35.240 --> 20:36.798
Anyway, you won't be missing it
for long.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.230
- Really?
- I've arranged a tutor for you both.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.673
A <i>Herr</i> Liszt
will be visiting twice a week.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.073
So we're not going to school?

20:48.920 --> 20:50.751
School's coming here?

20:51.800 --> 20:54.155
On an old bicycle, I gather.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.790
It's a bird without the...

21:37.800 --> 21:41.156
Good morning, little man.
And how are you this morning?

21:41.880 --> 21:44.838
- Can I ask you a favour?
- Well, you can ask.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.674
Are there any spare tyres around?

21:48.720 --> 21:51.109
An old one
from one of the trucks or something?

21:51.160 --> 21:53.913
Well, the only spare tyre
I've seen around here

21:53.960 --> 21:56.235
belongs to Lieutenant Meinberg.

22:01.760 --> 22:05.116
- Well, is he using it?
- Yes, he's very attached to it.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.673
Stop it. He doesn't understand.
He's only eight.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.156
You're only 12,
so stop pretending you're any older.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.918
What do you want a tyre for, anyway?

22:15.960 --> 22:18.952
- I want to make a swing.
- A swing?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.956
That does sound exciting.

22:26.960 --> 22:27.995
You!

22:29.600 --> 22:30.953
Here, now.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.475
Move!

22:37.320 --> 22:40.312
Take this boy to the outhouse
in the back garden.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.191
There are some tyres in there.
He will select one.

22:42.240 --> 22:45.391
You will carry it where he asks.
Do you understand?

22:49.520 --> 22:52.273
Well, little man,
what are you waiting for?

23:34.200 --> 23:35.872
How about this one?

24:21.400 --> 24:23.072
Where's my mum?

24:24.840 --> 24:26.193
She's out.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.314
- When is she back?
- Soon, I expect.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.112
But don't worry.

24:33.880 --> 24:37.190
- But I might bleed to death.
- No, you won't.

24:43.920 --> 24:48.471
- Will I need to go to hospital?
- No. It's only a small cut.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.670
Come on. It's not that bad.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.751
There, all better.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.790
- What's your name?
- Pavel.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.752
Now, you've got to sit still
for a few minutes

25:18.120 --> 25:20.714
before you start
walking around on that again.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.194
Will you tell my mum what happened?

25:24.240 --> 25:26.993
I think she's going to see it for herself.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.394
She'll probably take me to a doctor.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.272
I don't think so.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.512
- It could be worse than it looks.
- It isn't.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.313
How would you know?
You're not a doctor.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.074
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.238
You peel potatoes.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.516
I practised as a doctor.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.193
Before I...

25:55.240 --> 25:56.992
Before I came here.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.154
You couldn't have been much good
then, if you had to practise.

26:10.320 --> 26:14.711
Now, what are you going to be
when you grow up?

26:15.760 --> 26:18.718
I know. An explorer.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.232
How do you know that?

26:24.360 --> 26:26.237
Is it nice on the farm?

26:34.720 --> 26:37.280
Bruno. Bruno, what happened to you?

26:37.320 --> 26:40.949
I made a swing,
but I fell off it and cut my knee.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.515
But Pavel here, he carried me in
and put a bandage on it.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.277
- Go to your room.
- But Pavel says I...

26:53.320 --> 26:55.515
Don't argue. Go to your room.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.799
Thank you.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.760
It's not fair, you having this view.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.677
Well, I'm not swapping.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.397
I think school's here.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.235
No, I mean more recent history.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.909
- Are you interested in current affairs?
- Yes, very.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.589
So, you'll be aware of the situation

28:09.640 --> 28:11.835
in which our great nation
presently finds itself.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.198
Yes. I read newspapers whenever I can
and one of Father's men

28:16.240 --> 28:18.196
keeps me up to date
on everything that's happening.

28:18.240 --> 28:22.677
Good. And you, Bruno.
Have you been reading newspapers?

28:24.360 --> 28:27.750
- Have you been reading anything?
- Books.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.831
Good. What sort of books?

28:31.920 --> 28:33.751
Adventure books, mainly.

28:33.800 --> 28:38.715
You know, knights in shining armour,
exploring strange lands and stuff,

28:39.360 --> 28:41.430
and silly princesses
always getting in the way.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.952
Well, this is why I'm here to help.
You're how old now, Bruno? Eight?

28:46.800 --> 28:48.631
Time to get your head
out of those fiction books

28:48.680 --> 28:50.716
and start learning about fact.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.309
Time, I think,
to turn your mind to the real world,

28:54.360 --> 28:57.272
and I believe
this would be the perfect start.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.719
Die, die!

30:41.280 --> 30:43.396
Die, die.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.949
Hello.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.233
I'm exploring.

31:48.680 --> 31:52.593
- What are you doing?
- We're... We're building a new hut.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.719
Have you got lots of friends over there?

32:01.520 --> 32:04.080
A few. But we fight a lot.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.798
That's why I like being out here.
I can be on my own.

32:11.440 --> 32:14.079
- I'm Bruno.
- Shmuel.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.795
- Sorry?
- I'm Shmuel.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.749
That's your name? Never heard
of anyone called that before.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.030
I've never heard
of anyone called Bruno.

32:24.080 --> 32:27.914
But Shmuel. No one's called Shmuel.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.795
I live in the house, back there.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.553
- Have you got any food on you?
- No.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.393
Are you hungry?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.872
How old are you?

32:55.480 --> 32:57.755
- Eight.
- Me, too!

33:03.760 --> 33:07.309
It's not fair,
me being stuck over here on my own,

33:07.360 --> 33:10.079
while you're over there,
playing with friends all day.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.953
- Playing?
- Well, that number.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.550
- Isn't it a part of a game or something?
- It's just my number.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.670
Everyone gets given
a different number.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.196
Right. Then what happens?

33:24.200 --> 33:26.714
- I have to go back now!
- Really?

33:26.760 --> 33:27.909
Yeah.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.118
It was nice to meet you, Shmuel.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.356
And you, Bruno.

33:43.640 --> 33:44.755
Bye.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.191
Mum, I can't find my football.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.390
Well, it'll be
in one of your cupboards, sweet.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.237
It isn't. I've looked.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.189
Can I have a piece of chocolate?

34:05.800 --> 34:07.233
A piece. Yes.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.034
Bruno?

34:15.639 --> 34:18.871
- Have you looked in the cellar?
- The cellar?

34:19.639 --> 34:21.277
For your football.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.075
Damn.

35:25.080 --> 35:28.311
- Gretel, I've just seen all your...
- All my what?

35:29.480 --> 35:32.552
All your dolls, down in the cellar.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.511
Dolls are for little girls.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.199
It's not right to play with silly toys

35:39.240 --> 35:42.869
while people are away
risking their lives for the Fatherland.

36:22.040 --> 36:25.919
- "My people's density is my density."
- Destiny.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.915
"lts struggles and its sorrows,
its joys and its miseries are mine.

36:31.960 --> 36:35.475
"I must work and create
for the resurrection of my Fatherland.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.034
"The history of my people
is great and glorious."

36:38.080 --> 36:39.559
And it's 12:00.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.552
- I'm sorry?
- Isn't that when we finish?

36:46.520 --> 36:49.592
The termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide, Bruno,

36:49.640 --> 36:52.473
not the pupil.
Now, will you please continue.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.837
Bruno, there you are.

37:09.400 --> 37:12.995
I'm just going into town for an hour.
Do you want to come?

37:15.160 --> 37:17.310
You be careful on that thing.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.794
Thank you.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.236
Can I ask you something?

37:38.480 --> 37:41.119
Why do you people
wear pyjamas all day?

37:41.720 --> 37:44.951
- They're not pyjamas.
- Well, those.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.718
We have to.
They took all our other clothes away.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.557
- Who did?
- The soldiers.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.238
The soldiers? Why?

37:55.080 --> 37:57.753
I don't like soldiers. Do you?

37:58.600 --> 38:01.637
I do, quite. My dad's a soldier,

38:02.240 --> 38:05.437
but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.038
What sort, then?

38:08.760 --> 38:11.399
Well, he's the important sort.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.910
He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.508
- So is your dad a farmer?
- No, he's a watchmaker.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.118
Or was. Most of the time now,
he just mends boots.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.996
It's funny how grown-ups
can't make their minds up

38:31.040 --> 38:34.032
about what they want to do.
It's like Pavel.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.469
Do you know him? Lives over there.

38:37.840 --> 38:41.469
He used to be a doctor,
but gave it all up to peel potatoes.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.352
Can I ask you another question?

38:53.400 --> 38:55.675
What do you burn in those chimneys?

38:55.720 --> 38:59.269
I saw them going the other day.
Is it just lots of hay and stuff?

38:59.320 --> 39:02.278
I don't know.
We're not allowed over there.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.470
Mama says it's old clothes.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.159
Well, whatever it is, it smells horrid.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.436
I wish
you'd remembered the chocolate.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.072
Yes, I'm sorry.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.998
I know! Perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.554
I can't, can I? Because of this.

39:20.240 --> 39:22.674
But that's to stop
the animals getting out, isn't it?

39:22.720 --> 39:25.951
Animals?
No, it's to stop people getting out.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.276
Are you not allowed out?

39:29.160 --> 39:32.755
- Why? What have you done?
- I'm a Jew.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.156
I think I should go now.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.314
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- I'll try.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.954
- Goodbye, then!
- Bye.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.236
Little present, sweetheart.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.278
Thank you, Mummy.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.150
- Have you seen Bruno?
- Outside on his swing, I think.

40:32.160 --> 40:35.709
Yes, Thursday's perfect.
I'll have a car come to collect you both.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.990
Are Grandma and Grandpa coming?

40:39.280 --> 40:42.397
Hey, did you smell
that horrible smell the other day?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.273
- Coming from the chimneys.
- What sort of ill?

40:46.960 --> 40:49.076
The day I fell off the swing.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.154
- Did you smell it, Mum?
- Father.

40:52.440 --> 40:53.793
Mum.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.152
Let me speak to her.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.077
Yes, she is. I can hear her.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.994
Yes. We look forward to it. Goodbye.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.430
- Is Grandma not coming?
- No.

41:12.880 --> 41:16.316
She's poorly, apparently,
but Grandpa's coming.

41:18.320 --> 41:20.390
- Did you smell it, Dad?
- What?

41:20.440 --> 41:23.796
That horrid smell from the chimneys.
What is it?

41:27.400 --> 41:29.630
I think they just burn rubbish
there sometimes.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.352
- Look.
- What?

41:34.200 --> 41:35.758
- Hey!
- Gretel.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.079
Hey, that's not fair!

41:39.120 --> 41:40.599
- Gretel.
- What?

41:41.120 --> 41:42.712
It's only a game.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.149
Ralf, this tutor you brought in,

41:50.320 --> 41:53.949
does he usually teach children
as young as Gretel and Bruno?

41:54.520 --> 41:56.112
I believe so. Why?

41:56.160 --> 41:58.037
Well, do we know
what he's teaching them?

41:58.080 --> 41:59.877
Gretel seems to have become so...

41:59.920 --> 42:02.388
They're being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment.

42:02.440 --> 42:05.432
They mustn't get left behind.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.674
Come on.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.152
Let's get to bed.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.039
"The Jew slandered us
and incited our enemies.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.389
"The Jew corrupted us
through bad books.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.715
"He mocked
our literature and our music.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.035
"Everywhere, his influence
was destructive,

42:30.080 --> 42:32.913
"the eventual result of which
was our nation's collapse,

42:32.960 --> 42:34.837
- "and then..."
- Yes, Bruno.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.395
I don't understand.

42:37.440 --> 42:40.352
A nation's collapse
is all down to this one man?

42:40.400 --> 42:43.790
The Jew here
means the entire Jewish race.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.751
If it had been just one man,

42:45.800 --> 42:48.268
I'm sure something
would've been done about him.

42:50.320 --> 42:53.392
There is such a thing as a nice Jew,
though, isn't there?

42:53.440 --> 42:57.069
I think, Bruno,
if you ever found a nice Jew,

42:58.160 --> 43:00.993
you would be
the best explorer in the world.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.712
Continue, Gretel.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.552
"The aim of the Jew
is to become the ruler of humanity.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.114
<i>"The Jew is not creative,</i>
<i>but destructive.</i>

43:14.160 --> 43:16.594
"He is the enemy of culture.

43:16.640 --> 43:19.871
"Thousands of Germans
have been made poor by the Jew."

43:32.640 --> 43:34.119
Master Bruno.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.515
What are you doing? You've just
had your lunch, haven't you?

43:38.560 --> 43:42.269
I was going for a walk,
and I thought I might get peckish.

43:42.320 --> 43:45.039
But don't make a mess of your satchel.
Bring it here.

43:45.080 --> 43:49.437
- I'll wrap it properly for you.
- No. It's none of your business.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.152
Bruno, what is it?

43:51.960 --> 43:54.315
What are you doing with your satchel?

43:54.360 --> 43:58.956
<i>Herr</i> Liszt gave us some books.
I'm going out on the swing to read.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.276
- Let me see.
- What?

44:02.320 --> 44:04.914
- The books.
- No.

44:04.960 --> 44:08.714
Bruno, I just want to see
what books <i>Herr</i> Liszt has given you.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.956
- I told a lie.
- What?

44:13.040 --> 44:14.678
I've just got

44:17.000 --> 44:18.558
adventure books.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.431
Go on. Off you go, then.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.430
Now, Maria,
there's two extra for supper tonight.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.629
The <i>Kommandant's</i> father will be here,

44:35.680 --> 44:37.955
and I believe
Lieutenant Kotler is joining us.

44:59.840 --> 45:00.955
Here.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.558
What's the matter?

45:15.960 --> 45:18.838
- Don't throw it back.
- What? Why not?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.236
- It's dangerous.
- Dangerous?

45:22.280 --> 45:24.236
It's just a ball. Come on.

45:27.720 --> 45:29.631
Do you not like playing?

45:32.960 --> 45:35.633
- Just not ball games?
- Not here.

45:40.600 --> 45:44.309
- Tell me how the number game works.
- I told you, it's not a game.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.316
We just all have numbers.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.028
Shmuel!

46:07.240 --> 46:09.231
Bruno! What are you doing?

46:10.880 --> 46:13.917
My ball went over.
I was just getting it back.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.073
They smell even worse
when they burn, don't they?

46:26.120 --> 46:27.189
What?

46:43.400 --> 46:45.038
But, surely you...

47:00.200 --> 47:02.668
Elsa, I was sworn to secrecy.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.756
- From your own wife.
- Yes.

47:08.600 --> 47:12.878
I took an oath upon my life.
Do you understand?

47:14.600 --> 47:17.160
Elsa, you believe in this, too.

47:18.080 --> 47:22.835
- You want this country to be strong...
- No, Ralf, no! No, not that!

47:27.320 --> 47:28.753
How can you...

47:28.800 --> 47:30.392
- Because I'm a soldier.
- How can you...

47:30.440 --> 47:33.113
- Soldiers fight wars.
- That isn't war!

47:33.160 --> 47:35.958
It's a part of it! It's a vital part of it!

47:37.200 --> 47:41.079
The Fatherland we all desire,
all of us, you included,

47:41.120 --> 47:43.953
cannot be achieved
without work such as this!

47:46.520 --> 47:51.674
- Elsa. Elsa.
- Get away from me! Get away from me!

47:55.680 --> 47:56.999
Grandpa's here.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.600
- I don't believe this.
- Grandpa's here.

48:02.920 --> 48:05.070
We'll be through in a moment.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.476
Who told you about this?

48:47.000 --> 48:48.513
How's Grandma?

48:49.000 --> 48:51.389
She's a bit under the weather,
I'm afraid.

48:51.440 --> 48:55.399
It's a shame, she was so much
looking forward to seeing you.

48:55.440 --> 48:58.796
- Perhaps next time, if she feels up to it.
- Absolutely.

49:05.360 --> 49:09.797
You know, Ralf,
your mother really is sick.

49:10.720 --> 49:13.075
She's been talking about this visit
for weeks.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.475
Maybe that's what's made her sick.

49:22.120 --> 49:25.590
So, your father tells me
that you've got a tutor.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.870
Yes. He's nice.

49:28.320 --> 49:31.153
But he won't let us read
any adventure books.

49:31.440 --> 49:33.715
All we do is boring, old history.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.310
Let me tell you something, young man.

49:36.360 --> 49:40.558
If it wasn't for history, we wouldn't
all be sitting around this table.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.160
The work your father is doing here,

49:44.120 --> 49:45.997
history in the making.

49:56.080 --> 49:59.789
When I was your age, history was
my favourite subject by miles,

49:59.880 --> 50:02.110
which obviously
didn't please my father.

50:02.160 --> 50:03.479
Why not?

50:03.520 --> 50:06.398
Well, he was a professor of literature
at the university.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.716
Really, does he still teach?

50:12.520 --> 50:15.910
- I don't really know.
- You don't know?

50:18.720 --> 50:23.236
We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

50:25.680 --> 50:27.159
Really, when?

50:29.360 --> 50:32.636
About four years ago,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

50:35.920 --> 50:40.232
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

50:41.000 --> 50:42.558
Where did he go?

50:50.240 --> 50:51.912
Lieutenant Kotler,

50:53.160 --> 50:56.709
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

51:02.160 --> 51:05.118
I believe it was Switzerland,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

51:06.360 --> 51:08.669
How strange that he should choose
to leave the Fatherland

51:08.720 --> 51:10.199
at the very moment it needed him most.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.959
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.319
More wine!

51:16.640 --> 51:19.313
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

51:22.120 --> 51:23.712
Did he go there to take the air?

51:26.160 --> 51:27.912
I'm afraid I really don't know,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

51:27.960 --> 51:29.871
You'd have to ask him.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.559
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

51:32.600 --> 51:34.750
With him being in Switzerland.

51:35.440 --> 51:36.668
Come on!

51:37.800 --> 51:40.268
What's the matter with you tonight?

51:48.080 --> 51:52.756
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

51:54.520 --> 51:57.080
Unless, of course,
he had disagreements.

51:59.240 --> 52:02.550
- I mean, with government policy.
- One hears of such men.

52:03.320 --> 52:06.869
Disturbed, most of them,
or just plain cowards.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.351
- Even so, all of them traitors.
- Absolutely right.

52:10.800 --> 52:14.918
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father,

52:14.960 --> 52:18.555
you will have informed your superiors,
as is your duty.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.039
Lieutenant Kotler!

52:23.400 --> 52:26.233
You cretin Jew! Filth!

52:37.720 --> 52:39.039
Ralf!

52:43.600 --> 52:44.669
Jew!

52:45.760 --> 52:49.230
- But Dad just sat there.
- What did you expect him to do?

52:49.520 --> 52:51.272
The Jew deserved it.

52:59.920 --> 53:03.196
Can I ask you something
about the farm?

53:03.760 --> 53:06.832
Bruno, you don't still think it's a farm,
do you?

53:24.560 --> 53:27.552
It's a camp. What's called a work camp.

53:28.360 --> 53:30.396
For Jews, obviously.

53:32.240 --> 53:33.593
Just Jews?

53:34.800 --> 53:37.189
Because they're the best workers?

53:37.600 --> 53:39.636
They're not in there
because they're good, silly.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.398
They're no good at anything.

53:41.440 --> 53:43.158
They're in there because they're evil.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.316
- They're the enemy.
- The enemy?

53:45.360 --> 53:47.635
- But I thought we were fighting...
- They're evil, Bruno.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.557
Evil, dangerous vermin.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.833
They're the reason
we lost the Great War.

53:52.880 --> 53:56.714
Haven't you been listening to anything
<i>Herr</i> Liszt has been telling us?

53:56.760 --> 53:58.239
No. Not really.

54:00.960 --> 54:04.270
Dad's not horrible, is he?
He's a good man.

54:04.320 --> 54:08.074
- Of course, he is.
- But he's in charge of a horrible place.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.075
It's only horrible for them, Bruno.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.554
We should be proud of Dad,
now more than ever before.

54:13.600 --> 54:16.068
He's making the country great again.

55:06.160 --> 55:09.277
<i>Like you say, they're a bit strange.</i>
<i>A bit...</i>

55:09.320 --> 55:10.355
<i>Well, they're different.</i>

55:10.400 --> 55:12.231
<i>They're the enemy, Bruno.</i>

55:12.280 --> 55:14.191
<i>Evil, dangerous vermin.</i>

55:14.240 --> 55:17.232
<i>Well, you see,</i>
<i>they're not really people at all.</i>

55:40.440 --> 55:42.590
What are you doing here?

55:42.640 --> 55:46.679
They wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.878
We're not supposed to be friends,
you and me.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.878
We're meant to be enemies.
Did you know that?

56:11.600 --> 56:13.238
Do you want some?

56:23.280 --> 56:25.874
- What's your dad like?
- What's he like?

56:26.280 --> 56:27.872
Is he a good man?

56:30.640 --> 56:32.915
You've never thought he wasn't?

56:35.400 --> 56:37.391
And you're proud of him?

56:38.640 --> 56:40.631
Aren't you proud of yours?

56:44.800 --> 56:46.791
Is it really horrible in the camp?

56:47.760 --> 56:49.955
How dare you
talk to people in the house.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.638
How dare you!

56:54.320 --> 56:55.833
Are you eating?

56:58.280 --> 57:00.396
Have you been stealing food?

57:04.040 --> 57:07.715
- Answer me!
- No, sir. He gave it to me.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.678
He's my friend.

57:12.520 --> 57:13.635
What?

57:16.360 --> 57:17.713
Little man,

57:19.440 --> 57:21.556
do you know this Jew?

57:21.600 --> 57:22.999
Do you know this Jew?

57:23.040 --> 57:26.032
No, I just walked in,
and he was helping himself.

57:26.440 --> 57:29.034
I've never seen him before in my life.

57:37.640 --> 57:40.074
You, finish cleaning the glasses.

57:41.360 --> 57:42.952
When I come back,
we'll have a little chat

57:43.000 --> 57:46.709
about what happens to rats who steal.
Come away.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.599
<i>New arrivals here are happy</i>
<i>to discover that life in the camp</i>

59:26.640 --> 59:27.959
<i>is not all work.</i>

59:28.000 --> 59:30.673
<i>And that there's</i>
<i>ample opportunity for leisure also.</i>

59:31.040 --> 59:33.156
<i>At the end of their day</i>
<i>at the ironmongery</i>

59:33.200 --> 59:35.873
<i>or the build or boot factory,</i>
<i>the workers can enjoy</i>

59:35.920 --> 59:39.151
<i>the many forms of pastime</i>
<i>that the camp has to offer.</i>

59:40.000 --> 59:42.639
<i>Organised sport is very popular.</i>

59:42.680 --> 59:45.672
<i>Those that don't play</i>
<i>certainly enjoy watching.</i>

59:47.640 --> 59:49.039
<i>At the end of the working day,</i>

59:49.080 --> 59:51.389
<i>the centrally located café</i>
<i>is the ideal place</i>

59:51.440 --> 59:55.877
<i>for friends and families to join together</i>
<i>for a hearty and nutritious meal.</i>

59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.559
<i>The children, in particular,</i>
<i>enjoy the pastries and cakes on offer.</i>

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.234
<i>In the evenings,</i>
<i>the occasional music concerts,</i>

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.238
<i>either by visiting orchestras</i>
<i>or, indeed, by talented musicians</i>

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.033
<i>from within the camp itself,</i>
<i>are always well attended.</i>

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.509
<i>Other recreations include</i>
<i>reading in the library,</i>

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:24.317
<i>pottery, cookery, art and horticulture</i>
<i>for adult and child alike.</i>

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.399
<i>Almost any activity one could wish for</i>
<i>is available within the camp.</i>

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.155
Splendid.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.230
- Bravo. Excellent.
- Thank you.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.512
Goodbye, little man.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.197
Shmuel! Shmuel!

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.590
I don't understand.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.029
I saw a film about the camp,

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.197
and it looked so nice.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.196
I don't know why I did it.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.273
Gretel and everyone
were saying all these things,

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.436
and that soldier's so scary.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.995
Been coming here for days,
but you were never here.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.716
I thought maybe
we weren't friends any more.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:24.032
Shmuel, I'm really sorry for what I did.
We are still friends, aren't we?

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.516
Where's Kurt these days?
I haven't seen him for ages.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.231
- Who's Kurt?
- Lieutenant Kotler.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.390
He's been moved to the front.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.471
It was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.158
would be put to better use there.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.236
<i>Herr Kommandant,</i> telephone.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.509
In actual fact, Gretel, he was sent there

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.312
because he failed
to inform the authorities

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.669
of his father's
lack of loyalty to the Party.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.517
Which was his duty, I might add.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.596
- Which was his bad luck.
- Bad luck?

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.599
Well, bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal, and not his mother.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.279
One presumably
doesn't have to report one's mother.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.597
- What?
- When will Pavel be back?

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.074
- Mum?
- Never, stupid.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.989
It's Father. They've been bombed.

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.838
Grandmother's dead.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.795
"...the victory
which You have obtained for us

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.070
"and for all who sleep in Him,

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.590
"keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.870
"with all that wait for Thee on earth,

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.275
"and with all that are around Thee
in heaven,

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.595
"in union with Him
who is the resurrection

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.235
"and the life, who liveth and reigneth
with Thee and the Holy Ghost,

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.238
"ever one God, world without end.
Amen."

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.716
He can't have that on there.
She wouldn't have wanted it.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.108
He does.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.434
"Almighty God, who by the death of..."

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.879
<i>Have you ever been to a funeral?</i>

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.950
My grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.230
but there weren't any funerals.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.636
That one there to there.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.955
They both died at the same time?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.628
What of?

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.109
I don't know.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.869
Papa said they must have caught
something on the way here.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.992
They had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.031
We didn't see them again.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.359
This is fun.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.916
Wish we could do something
a bit more exciting, though.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.076
- That one there to there.
- This one?

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.791
- This one?
- No, that one.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.277
- This one to here?
- No, there!

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.311
- To here?
- No.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.078
- Here?
- No.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.560
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.716
You can't behave like this!

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:21.511
- You're questioning my behaviour?
- It can't continue!

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.109
I know.
I can't stand this any more, Ralf.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.469
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.511
Don't you think there will be questions?

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.959
- Questions?
- Well, now, what does it say

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.515
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.393
- Work? Is that what you call it?
- Pull yourself together, woman.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:40.158
Right. Just ignore it. Ignore it.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.828
Ignore the fact
that the man I married is a monster!

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.680
Even your own mother
couldn't love you.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.718
Are you happy here?

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.712
Yes. Very.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.392
And you, Gretel?

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:12.234
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.670
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.228
No. Not any more, really.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.953
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose,

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.515
would you prefer
to live somewhere else?

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.314
- Back home?
- No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.715
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.996
All of us? You as well?

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.231
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.840
I must stay
and complete my work here.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.635
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it...

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.833
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.632
Would you like that?

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:29.513
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.154
The important thing is
your mother does not feel

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.998
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood,

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.555
and the more I think about it, the more
I realise she's very probably right.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.033
- But, Dad...
- No!

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.070
It's time for you to move away.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.116
Is everything all right?

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.751
We can't find Papa.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.360
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men,

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.470
and they haven't come back.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.755
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.277
How long for this time?

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.076
That's why it's bad. It's forever, I think.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.318
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.832
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow. After lunch.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.510
So, I won't ever see you again?

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.239
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin if you like,

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.397
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.833
I wish I could've helped you
find your dad.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.716
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.672
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.473
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.351
- I could dig under.
- What? With that?

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.473
- No, but I could bring something.
- You don't want to come over here.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.909
Look.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.397
- I could come through to your side.
- What's the point in that?

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.238
Your dad's not going to be over here,
is he?

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.594
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.437
I don't look like you.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.076
You could look like me, though.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.395
If you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.476
I'm not shaving my hair off.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.799
- You could cover it with a cap.
- My pyjamas are a different colour.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.469
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them,

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.080
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.270
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.834
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.156
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.316
And don't forget the pyjamas!

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.869
Bruno?

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.075
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.199
- Bruno...
- It's my last chance.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.351
All right. Go on then.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.198
- I thought you weren't coming!
- I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.789
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pyjamas!

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.592
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.674
Shmuel.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.155
Here.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.759
How do I look?

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.677
Right. Let's get going.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.389
Bruno?

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.159
That's enough.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.230
Let's go and find your dad.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.554
Come on!

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.593
Master Bruno?

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.674
Shmuel.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.633
- Can we go to the café or something?
- Café?

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.712
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.949
Yeah.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.236
We'll check our hut first.

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.474
Bruno?

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.748
Come on.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.595
Papa?

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.955
Up! Up! Get up!

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.956
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.752
We go on marches sometimes.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.711
Move! Up, up!

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.518
Move, move!

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.079
Bruno!

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.272
He must still be
outside somewhere, ma'am.

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.119
Bruno!

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:50.994
Bruno?

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.872
- Move!
- Quickly!

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.188
Get up!

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.352
Get up. You must!

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.919
Move them out!

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.275
...which means that
our weekly capabilities

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.833
would be almost tripled,

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.075
so, therefore,
by the end of the summer...

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:35.112
- Ralf.
- Elsa, I'm in a meeting.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.272
Bruno's missing.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.039
Come on!

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.038
Wait here!

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.719
Come on!

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.793
Move! Move!

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.992
Join the queue!

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.279
Come on, you!

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.473
Bruno!

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.628
Move it!

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.634
Go on.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.508
Bruno!

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:59.550
It's all right. I think we're just waiting
in here until the rain stops.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.953
Clothes off!

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.716
Where are we going?

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.951
No, it's just a shower.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.839
A shower?

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.399
Open the gates! Open the gates!

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.955
Move!

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.716
Bruno!

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.440
