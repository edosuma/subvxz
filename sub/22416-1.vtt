00:57.473 --> 00:59.639
Dude, working late doesn't make you smarter

00:59.641 --> 01:01.608
- than the rest of us.
- Hey.

01:01.610 --> 01:04.012
Hey. Rajesh, you've got some pixels out.

01:04.013 --> 01:06.681
Email Eddie and he'll
replace that monitor for you.

01:06.683 --> 01:08.515
Thanks, Noah.

01:08.517 --> 01:10.253
It's not the screen.

01:11.687 --> 01:13.620
What is it?

01:13.622 --> 01:16.089
Problem with the dish? Maybe a
bird landed on it or something.

01:16.091 --> 01:17.658
No. No.

01:17.660 --> 01:22.629
That's crazy, it could be...

01:23.966 --> 01:26.401
You'd better wake up, Dr. Picciotto!

01:26.403 --> 01:29.071
What is it?

01:39.615 --> 01:41.114
Dark matter.

01:41.116 --> 01:42.616
Get me a triangulation.

01:42.618 --> 01:44.153
Yeah.

01:58.401 --> 01:59.667
Oh, my God.

01:59.669 --> 02:01.134
What is it?

02:01.136 --> 02:03.506
It's falling straight for us.

02:07.177 --> 02:11.645
This is Dr. Picciotto. Get me the Pentagon.

03:43.338 --> 03:47.877
Johanna, have you seen my
flashlight? The big metal one?

03:49.511 --> 03:50.510
You mean this?

03:50.512 --> 03:52.447
Oh, geez. Sorry.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.848
Gonna be late. Rick's practice
get's out in half an hour.

03:54.850 --> 03:59.656
Just try to relax, Matt. This
is supposed to be fun, remember?

04:02.458 --> 04:04.091
Ew, gross!

04:04.093 --> 04:06.492
- Gross? You're gross!
- No, you are!

04:06.494 --> 04:08.027
I don't know. Pretty
soon, you're going to want

04:08.029 --> 04:09.596
to be smooching somebody yourself.

04:09.598 --> 04:11.666
- Never.
- Cassie, can you go get your sister?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.236
Your dad's ready to go.

04:15.971 --> 04:18.241
Kaley!

04:19.942 --> 04:21.478
What?

04:25.181 --> 04:27.515
Are you sure we shouldn't
be doing this together?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.749
No, not really.

04:29.751 --> 04:31.751
You know. I feel like it'd
be good if you stayed here and

04:31.753 --> 04:35.121
you bonded with the girls and
I've got a son with a serious

04:35.123 --> 04:38.958
case of teenage-itis in
desperate need of some

04:38.960 --> 04:43.164
father and son time... I think. I hope.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.265
There's one thing I do know for sure.

04:45.267 --> 04:49.003
- Hmm.
- I'm sure that I love you.

04:49.005 --> 04:51.141
I love you.

04:55.510 --> 04:57.111
You're leaving?

04:57.113 --> 04:59.679
Yeah! Picking up Rick from practice.

04:59.681 --> 05:02.152
We'll be back Sunday
night, okay? So come here.

05:05.154 --> 05:06.587
Okay.

05:06.589 --> 05:08.356
There might not be any
cell service up there.

05:08.358 --> 05:11.525
So, why don't we try the short waves again?

05:11.527 --> 05:15.296
I haven't used that
thing since I was her age.

05:15.298 --> 05:16.700
I don't even know where it is.

05:18.667 --> 05:22.802
Okay, well, you ladies have
a good weekend and play nice!

05:22.804 --> 05:24.273
Alright.

05:25.709 --> 05:26.939
I love you.

05:26.941 --> 05:28.176
See you, Sunday.

05:28.178 --> 05:30.046
Bye

05:32.315 --> 05:35.282
So... what shall we do tomorrow?

05:35.284 --> 05:38.686
Volleyball? Motocross again?

05:38.688 --> 05:41.224
I could teach you girls rock climbing.

05:42.323 --> 05:44.426
- Mani-pedi.
- Mani-pedi.

06:24.233 --> 06:25.732
Come on. Enough with the
phone already, alright?

06:25.734 --> 06:28.270
You haven't said two words
since I picked you up.

06:31.073 --> 06:34.340
I can't believe you picked
me up in the Grunt mobile.

06:34.342 --> 06:36.744
Why'd you even buy this thing anyhow?

06:36.746 --> 06:38.578
Well, you know we need
something for camping,

06:38.580 --> 06:43.049
and military surplus was a lot
cheaper than a brand-new Jeep.

06:43.051 --> 06:44.352
Besides, this thing...

06:44.354 --> 06:46.886
can go anywhere and do anything.

06:46.888 --> 06:50.123
Yeah. But why you have
to pick me up at school?

06:50.125 --> 06:51.626
All my friends think you're...

06:51.628 --> 06:53.393
The coolest dad ever?

06:53.395 --> 06:55.395
- An environmental terrorist.
- Alright.

06:55.397 --> 06:57.734
You know this thing gets
like ten miles to the gallon.

06:59.135 --> 07:00.534
You thought it was cool when we got it.

07:00.536 --> 07:02.936
You even helped me fix it up, remember?

07:02.938 --> 07:05.607
I was 10. I handed you tools.

07:08.044 --> 07:10.279
Well... Johanna thinks it's cool.

07:13.750 --> 07:17.284
Hey, look, Rick. Your mom's
been gone for awhile now. Okay?

07:17.286 --> 07:20.490
And we can't live in grief forever.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.357
Alright, Jo's family now.
You don't have to love her

07:24.359 --> 07:26.359
but you gotta get along with her.

07:26.361 --> 07:28.729
Okay. She'll never be your mother, but...

07:28.731 --> 07:31.568
She's not old enough to be my mother!

07:33.936 --> 07:36.106
You're such a cliché.

07:37.974 --> 07:40.941
Alright, we're all just people
doing the best we can, okay?

07:40.943 --> 07:45.313
And you're playing the angry
teenager cliché pretty well yourself.

07:45.315 --> 07:48.184
Yeah, well, one of us has to act our age.

08:15.777 --> 08:17.376
It's definitely at zero.

08:17.378 --> 08:19.179
It's accelerating at point 5 C.

08:19.181 --> 08:20.981
That's impossible.

08:20.983 --> 08:23.219
Rajesh! Rajesh! Rajesh!

08:24.486 --> 08:25.885
It's accelerating towards us.

08:25.887 --> 08:27.354
How can that be?

08:27.356 --> 08:30.260
Gravity's a bitch. Less
than eight hours now.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.259
Well, the Secretary of Defense,

08:33.260 --> 08:36.596
the President's Science
Advisor, the NASA Administrator,

08:36.597 --> 08:38.698
the Director of
Astrophysical research at JPL,

08:38.701 --> 08:40.801
dozens of top scientists
from around the world,

08:40.803 --> 08:42.768
and I, all agree.

08:42.770 --> 08:44.971
There's nothing we can do to stop it.

08:44.973 --> 08:46.605
Nothing?

08:46.607 --> 08:49.542
They've put the military on
alert, recalled all off-duty

08:49.544 --> 08:52.579
personnel and initiated
continuity of government plans,

08:52.581 --> 08:55.615
but there's no way to stop
what's going to happen.

08:55.617 --> 08:59.353
What about warning the public? Evacuations?

08:59.355 --> 09:01.922
It would just cause panic.

09:01.924 --> 09:03.657
What's gonna happen?

09:03.659 --> 09:05.825
I'm still not certain,

09:05.827 --> 09:07.961
but I suspect we are
all going to get a pretty

09:07.963 --> 09:10.967
good idea of how the dinosaurs felt.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.736
What should we do, Professor?

09:17.905 --> 09:19.241
Call your families.

09:21.209 --> 09:23.744
And then set up connections
with every earth observatory,

09:23.746 --> 09:25.979
every ground station, every
earth monitor, everywhere.

09:25.981 --> 09:27.413
Keep the information flowing,

09:27.415 --> 09:29.986
and learn everything we
can about dark matter.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.692
It may be the last thing
that science ever does.

09:48.035 --> 09:50.806
There should be good
fishing this time of year.

09:54.543 --> 09:57.109
I could show you some of those
jujitsu moves that you always

09:57.111 --> 09:59.646
wanted me to teach you when
I was taking those classes.

09:59.648 --> 10:02.181
Yeah, that was before I found out that your

10:02.183 --> 10:04.721
teacher was moving in with us.

10:07.289 --> 10:09.424
Here. Be useful.

10:12.694 --> 10:19.133
In 3.8 miles, you're going to
turn right onto "Dirt Road."

10:19.135 --> 10:20.466
Sounds promising.

10:20.468 --> 10:22.838
Dirt Road? It sounds like an adventure.

10:32.146 --> 10:34.915
<i>Traffic in downtown
DC was snarled for</i>

10:34.917 --> 10:37.117
<i>hours today by a surprise

10:37.119 --> 10:40.921

10:40.923 --> 10:45.091
<i>explanation of why the exercise
was not previously announced.</i>

10:45.093 --> 10:47.627
<i>Also, today the president

10:47.629 --> 10:50.163
<i>an unscheduled visit at Camp David.</i>

10:50.165 --> 10:53.066

10:56.237 --> 10:57.773
<i>and closest friends.</i>

10:59.174 --> 11:01.908
Alright, let's see if we can
do this. Know how to do it?

11:01.910 --> 11:04.244
Here. Help me out.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.716
Not off to a good start.

11:08.784 --> 11:10.086
Okay.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.088
So, how's school?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.156
Fine.

11:16.158 --> 11:19.960
Just fine? You don't want
to expand on that at all?

11:19.962 --> 11:21.097
Nope.

11:22.564 --> 11:24.665
It's gonna be hot, huh?

11:24.667 --> 11:25.802
Yeah.

11:26.968 --> 11:28.438
Yeah. Okay.

11:29.837 --> 11:32.439
Well, you know, I was at
the grocery store yesterday.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.840
It's a funny story, actually.

11:33.842 --> 11:35.042
Is this right?

11:35.044 --> 11:36.042
Yeah.

11:36.044 --> 11:39.213
And, uh, I was at the checkout.

11:39.215 --> 11:43.816
And this... the cashier asked
me if I wanted my milk in a bag,

11:43.818 --> 11:48.524
and I said, "No I'd rather
keep it in a carton."

11:50.458 --> 11:52.428
Are you kidding me?

11:56.631 --> 11:58.965
Come on. Lighten up a little bit. Come on.

11:58.967 --> 12:03.070
Are you trying to make
this miserable for me?

12:03.072 --> 12:05.707
Come on. Pull.

12:10.178 --> 12:11.912
Ta-da.

12:11.914 --> 12:13.482
About time.

12:48.516 --> 12:50.685
No service.

12:52.321 --> 12:53.689
That's kinda the point.

12:54.991 --> 12:59.292
I really hope that we can
talk this weekend, Ricky.

12:59.294 --> 13:03.128
What's there to talk about?
You married her for you,

13:03.130 --> 13:05.031
and me and the girls
just have to live with it.

13:05.033 --> 13:06.566
You know, I think she'd be good for you

13:06.568 --> 13:08.037
if you just gave her a chance.

13:09.572 --> 13:11.006
Sure.

13:17.545 --> 13:19.546
Fishing tomorrow?

13:19.548 --> 13:21.918
Sure, Dad.

13:23.685 --> 13:26.387
Good night, Ricky.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.457
Good night, Dad.

14:41.696 --> 14:43.596
Twenty seconds.

14:43.598 --> 14:45.731
Definitely northern Alaska.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.466
I've got video feed from the ISS!

14:47.468 --> 14:49.104
Put it on the big screen.

14:51.372 --> 14:54.373
Ten, nine, eight...

14:54.375 --> 14:57.143
I'm tapped into the USGS seismic network.

14:57.145 --> 15:00.312
Five, four...

15:00.314 --> 15:04.719
...three, two, one!

15:15.765 --> 15:17.898
Oh, my God.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.770
It went straight through the planet.

15:24.206 --> 15:25.775
There.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.354
Seismic sensors all over the world...

16:19.160 --> 16:21.664
Mom! Mom!

16:24.698 --> 16:25.998
Get in the doorframe!

16:26.000 --> 16:28.468
It'll be over in a second.

16:56.664 --> 16:58.767
- Let's get out of here!
- Go!

17:01.871 --> 17:03.738
Go, go, go.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.442
Take the stairs!

17:23.559 --> 17:25.428
Come here. Come on, girls.

18:11.773 --> 18:13.275
Help.

18:14.642 --> 18:16.042
- Help.
- Cassie.

18:16.044 --> 18:18.880
Cassie. I'm right here. Are you okay?

18:20.282 --> 18:22.249
Kaley?

18:22.251 --> 18:24.751
Come here. Give me your
hand. Give me your hand.

18:24.753 --> 18:26.552
I got you.

18:26.554 --> 18:29.121
- It was the big one, wasn't it?
- I don't know.

18:29.123 --> 18:30.992
Johanna?

18:32.261 --> 18:33.525
Johanna?

18:33.527 --> 18:34.726
Hmm?

18:34.728 --> 18:35.928
Johanna?

18:35.930 --> 18:38.598
Uh, yeah.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.903
I'm right here. Hang on.

18:44.639 --> 18:46.473
You're bleeding!

18:46.475 --> 18:48.310
- Where?
- Let me see. Let me see.

18:50.012 --> 18:51.945
It's okay. It's okay.

18:51.947 --> 18:54.214
Just stay calm. It's just a head wound.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.849
They look a lot worse then they are.

18:55.851 --> 18:58.685
What you should do is take your
sleeve and put pressure on it.

18:58.687 --> 19:00.119
It's okay,

19:00.121 --> 19:02.088
I took a spill on my
dirt bike once and it was

19:02.090 --> 19:03.389
bleeding worse than that.

19:03.391 --> 19:06.092
But after a few minutes, it was okay.

19:06.094 --> 19:07.994
Can you find a clean part of your sleeve

19:07.996 --> 19:09.899
and put pressure on it?

19:11.999 --> 19:15.167
- What are you wearing?
- It, um,

19:15.169 --> 19:18.538
- I, I...
- Just keep the pressure.

19:18.540 --> 19:22.876
Cass? Cassie, are you
okay? Are you hurt at all?

19:22.878 --> 19:24.343
Um...

19:24.345 --> 19:25.544
Um...

19:25.546 --> 19:26.745
I don't know.

19:26.747 --> 19:28.148
Wiggle your fingers and toes.

19:28.150 --> 19:29.182
What?

19:29.184 --> 19:31.017
Wiggle your fingers and all your toes.

19:31.019 --> 19:34.721
Can you move them all? Does it hurt?

19:34.723 --> 19:37.724
No. It doesn't hurt. Ow!

19:37.726 --> 19:41.128
Okay. I need you to pull that
out, then you're going to suck

19:41.130 --> 19:44.263
on your finger and spit it out. Okay?

19:44.265 --> 19:46.465
- Come on, you can do it.
- Come on, Cassie. Come on.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.603
Come on.

19:51.073 --> 19:53.171
Oh! Good girl. Good girl.

19:53.173 --> 19:54.541
Now, just put your thumb...

19:54.543 --> 19:57.178
put pressure with your thumb on that. Okay?

20:06.121 --> 20:07.721
Okay, that's going to keep happening.

20:07.723 --> 20:10.290
We need to get out of here!

20:10.292 --> 20:13.059
Yes, we do. I'm going to
get you girls out of here

20:13.061 --> 20:15.264
and we're going to go get your dad.

20:16.898 --> 20:19.001
Should we use the stairs?

20:21.937 --> 20:23.602
Look.

20:23.604 --> 20:25.705
We're in a little bit of trouble.

20:25.707 --> 20:28.574
But it's going to be okay.

20:28.576 --> 20:34.115
Just... just keep calm and do what I say.

20:49.096 --> 20:52.667
Come here, Hey, Rick, Hey. Rick! Rick!

20:54.101 --> 20:56.035
- Rick!
- I Can't.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.436
Give me your hand.

20:57.438 --> 20:58.573
I can't.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.644
I can't get out. Dad! I'm trapped!

21:15.224 --> 21:17.626
Give me your hand. Come on. Up. Come on.

21:30.805 --> 21:32.240
Come on, go!

21:39.147 --> 21:40.679
Come on, Rick! Climb, Climb! Climb!

21:40.681 --> 21:43.582
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You have to.

21:43.584 --> 21:45.084
Come on!

21:45.086 --> 21:47.155
Come on! Climb!

21:51.059 --> 21:52.494
Come on.

21:53.861 --> 21:56.230
- Help! Down here! Help!
- Come on.

21:58.565 --> 21:59.831
Come on.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.734
Come on. There's a ledge right up there.

22:01.736 --> 22:04.170
We can get our feet, we can rest up there.

22:04.172 --> 22:06.240
But you got to climb, okay? Come on.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.150
Okay.

22:18.152 --> 22:20.021
We've got to keep climbing.

22:21.255 --> 22:23.523
I can't. Someone will come.

22:23.525 --> 22:25.359
No. Come on. We have to keep climbing.

22:25.361 --> 22:28.394
Nobody's gonna save us,
alright? We got to keep going.

22:28.396 --> 22:29.763
I never should have come on this trip.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.430
How could I have known this would happen?

22:31.432 --> 22:33.800
I used to think you were an action hero!

22:33.802 --> 22:35.767
I used to think you could do anything!

22:35.769 --> 22:38.003
I thought I could be safe
whenever I was with you!

22:38.005 --> 22:42.309
And now you're just a
stereotype for a mid-life crisis!

22:42.311 --> 22:45.311
And it's going to get us both killed.

22:45.313 --> 22:47.080
Look, Rick. No matter what I've done, okay?

22:47.082 --> 22:48.680
No matter what it looks like.

22:48.682 --> 22:51.250
I'm still the same on the
inside that I have always been.

22:51.252 --> 22:53.019
Okay? I'm still the same father that

22:53.021 --> 22:54.520
I've always been to you, okay?

22:54.522 --> 22:58.657
And I will never ever let
anything happen to you!

22:58.659 --> 22:59.794
Look out!

23:01.596 --> 23:04.365
Ricky! Hey. Ricky.

23:09.204 --> 23:11.473
Stop, stop, stop.

23:15.544 --> 23:17.813
What do we do?

23:18.880 --> 23:20.215
My phone.

23:28.489 --> 23:30.159
Try Dad.

23:33.195 --> 23:34.426
The cell towers are all probably down.

23:34.428 --> 23:35.795
It was a big quake.

23:35.797 --> 23:38.631
We could try calling for help again.

23:41.302 --> 23:43.138
Girls, cover your heads.

23:47.207 --> 23:52.545
Okay, on three. One, two, three...

23:52.547 --> 23:54.449
Help!

23:59.688 --> 24:01.457
Again?

24:02.524 --> 24:04.359
Help!

24:06.428 --> 24:08.762
Oh! Grab the rebar.

24:08.764 --> 24:10.196
What?

24:10.198 --> 24:12.165
That piece of metal.

24:12.167 --> 24:14.470
- A lever!
- Exactly.

24:15.870 --> 24:19.405
Just shove it under the
concrete. Don't stab me.

24:19.407 --> 24:21.073
We can't do this. We need to get help.

24:21.075 --> 24:24.545
There's no time for that.
The building could collapse.

24:26.782 --> 24:29.182
Look, girls, it's going to be okay.

24:29.184 --> 24:31.083
You just need to free my leg.

24:31.085 --> 24:34.719
Then we are just going to walk
down the stairs and go outside.

24:34.721 --> 24:38.292
That's it. I need you to
stay calm for your sister.

24:48.203 --> 24:49.869
Girls, this is no problem.

24:49.871 --> 24:52.538
When I was climbing in
Nepal, my buddy got her arm

24:52.540 --> 24:55.041
clean cut off in an avalanche.

24:55.043 --> 24:57.476
I had to carry her down a mountain.

24:57.478 --> 25:00.946
But we got to a hospital
and they reattached her arm

25:00.948 --> 25:02.915
and she was fine.

25:02.917 --> 25:05.451
That was a mountain.
We just have to go down

25:05.453 --> 25:07.389
a few sets of stairs.

25:09.056 --> 25:10.856
You carried her arm too?

25:10.858 --> 25:15.364
No. She carried that in her other hand.

25:17.064 --> 25:18.600
Cool.

25:20.767 --> 25:22.769
Come on.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.036
Wait.

25:24.038 --> 25:27.106
When you lift that up
there might be more blood.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.506
I'm going to need a bandage.

25:28.508 --> 25:30.409
We don't have any bandages.

25:30.411 --> 25:32.911
Kaley, I'm going to need
you to rip your sleeve off.

25:32.913 --> 25:36.250
No! I just got this! Why
can't it be hers or something?

25:39.053 --> 25:40.389
Sorry.

25:48.196 --> 25:49.929
It won't work.

25:49.931 --> 25:52.932
You're just gonna have to
take it off and use both hands.

25:52.934 --> 25:56.167
I don't have anything on underneath.

25:56.169 --> 26:01.509
Kaley. Look. We're just gonna
look away. Right, Cassie?

26:12.419 --> 26:14.323
Can I get some light?

26:56.665 --> 26:57.832
Here.

26:58.967 --> 27:00.302
Thank you, Kaley.

27:01.169 --> 27:02.504
Okay.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.137
On three.

27:05.139 --> 27:08.541
One. Two. Three.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.976
Keep going. Keep going.

27:29.497 --> 27:31.667
Okay. Okay.

27:33.333 --> 27:34.833
Let's get out of here.

27:45.346 --> 27:46.881
Come on, Cassie.

28:11.739 --> 28:12.907
Geez.

28:15.409 --> 28:16.742
Is everyone alright?

28:16.744 --> 28:19.212
I think my arm's broken.

28:19.214 --> 28:21.116
Or maybe not.

28:27.354 --> 28:30.188
We need to reboot. We've
got to see what happened.

28:30.190 --> 28:32.494
The network is counting
on us to relay data.

28:34.728 --> 28:37.263
The Space Station feed comes
directly into the antenna.

28:37.265 --> 28:38.833
That might work.

28:42.571 --> 28:44.639
Oh, my God.

28:55.283 --> 28:58.583
<i>This is Richard Paul

30:02.784 --> 30:03.919
Oh, God.

30:31.379 --> 30:33.014
Ow!

30:34.882 --> 30:37.616
Ow! I stepped on something.

30:37.618 --> 30:38.818
I think I cut my foot.

30:38.820 --> 30:40.820
I know, honey. We all have.

30:40.822 --> 30:42.754
But we have to keep moving.

30:42.756 --> 30:45.560
Okay? We'll take care of
it when we get outside.

30:48.428 --> 30:50.562
You okay?

30:50.564 --> 30:53.398
Yeah. Stay there.

30:54.601 --> 30:56.368
It's okay. It's okay.

30:56.370 --> 30:57.973
It's okay.

30:59.306 --> 31:01.340
Is he dead?

31:01.342 --> 31:03.641
Yes. Don't look at him, okay?

31:03.643 --> 31:06.111
He probably fell down the stairs.

31:06.113 --> 31:08.379
It's sad, but he can't hurt us.

31:08.381 --> 31:09.615
What if we can't get out?

31:09.617 --> 31:10.949
We could die.

31:10.951 --> 31:13.719
- I wish Dad were here.
- We are not gonna die.

31:13.721 --> 31:15.588
Hey, we are gonna keep
going down the stairs.

31:15.590 --> 31:17.092
And we're going to go get your dad.

31:19.494 --> 31:22.594
What if there are more dead people?

31:22.596 --> 31:24.530
Cassie, look at me.

31:24.532 --> 31:27.532
I just want you to follow me
follow me, and keep walking.

31:27.534 --> 31:30.936
And we're gonna get outside
and we're gonna go get your dad.

31:30.938 --> 31:33.174
Dead people can't hurt us.

31:34.609 --> 31:36.407
Okay.

31:36.409 --> 31:37.746
Come on.

31:42.617 --> 31:44.085
There you go.

32:00.101 --> 32:01.736
Shh.

32:03.537 --> 32:04.736
Come on.

32:04.738 --> 32:07.107
I think it's the neighbors.

32:26.127 --> 32:27.659
Okay.

32:27.661 --> 32:29.128
Alright.

32:29.130 --> 32:30.799
Ricky.

32:33.667 --> 32:34.933
Ricky. Easy, easy, easy, easy.

32:34.935 --> 32:36.769
Easy, buddy. Easy. Easy. Easy.

32:36.771 --> 32:38.940
I got ya. I got ya.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.842
You okay?

32:44.844 --> 32:47.245
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:47.247 --> 32:50.818
Okay. Let's get you from there then.

32:53.888 --> 32:57.993
Hey. Hello? Is someone there?

32:59.593 --> 33:01.161
Who is that?

33:04.798 --> 33:06.098
Aurora and May?

33:06.100 --> 33:07.866
Cassie! Thank God you're alright.

33:07.868 --> 33:09.600
Is your sister with you?

33:09.602 --> 33:11.035
Hi, May.

33:11.037 --> 33:13.438
Hello, sweetheart. Oh, you've cut yourself.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.141
No. It's okay. It's okay.
Can we get out of here?

33:16.143 --> 33:19.811
We're trying to get in.
That's the only way down.

33:19.813 --> 33:21.746
Come on, girls. Help me push this.

33:21.748 --> 33:22.947
- Come on.
- Okay.

33:22.949 --> 33:24.818
Come on over here, Cassie.

33:35.262 --> 33:37.032
You're hurt.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.565
- I'm Aurora.
- I'm May.

33:40.567 --> 33:42.136
We got you.

33:43.204 --> 33:44.735
Come on.

33:56.350 --> 33:57.649
Come on.

33:57.651 --> 33:59.688
Come on. Go.

34:01.421 --> 34:02.756
Oh, man.

34:04.124 --> 34:07.392
Ricky, I'm so sorry. Are you alright?

34:07.394 --> 34:08.893
Yeah. I think so.

34:08.896 --> 34:10.428
Let me see.

34:10.429 --> 34:12.063
How many fingers?

34:12.065 --> 34:13.467
Just one.

34:15.702 --> 34:18.070
Okay, follow my finger.

34:18.072 --> 34:20.838
I'm okay, Dad. I'm okay, Dad. Really.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.639
Okay. Hey. Thank you.

34:22.641 --> 34:24.909
Oh. No, no. No problem at all.

34:24.911 --> 34:27.312
Hell of a quake, huh?

34:27.313 --> 34:28.914
That had to be a 9.

34:28.916 --> 34:30.783
I have never felt anything like that.

34:30.784 --> 34:33.485
I wonder if it hit the city.

34:33.487 --> 34:34.822
That's a good question.

34:36.224 --> 34:38.889
I got some spare pants in here.

34:38.891 --> 34:40.525
I think you could use these.

34:40.527 --> 34:41.896
Oh.

34:44.063 --> 34:45.431
Thanks.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.877
Hello there.

34:56.976 --> 34:58.913
Are you alright, sir?

35:00.146 --> 35:01.613
Sir?

35:01.615 --> 35:04.883
My name is Roberto Gianelli.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.055
"Sir" is what you call old men.

35:10.892 --> 35:13.528
I don't look old to you, do I?

35:15.563 --> 35:17.896
That's all right, miss.

35:17.898 --> 35:20.700
You got to be 90 before you're old, right?

35:20.702 --> 35:23.401
A little bit to go yet, huh?

35:26.941 --> 35:29.140
Quite a sight to behold.

35:29.142 --> 35:31.744
Five angels descending from heaven.

35:31.746 --> 35:33.111
Yeah.

35:33.113 --> 35:35.381
What are you doing here, Mr. Gianelli?

35:35.383 --> 35:37.986
We should be getting out of the building.

35:39.086 --> 35:42.787
Right you are. That's for sure.

35:42.789 --> 35:44.321
I got out of my apartment okay.

35:44.323 --> 35:47.892
I got in the stairwell and
all, like they tell you...

35:47.894 --> 35:50.394
The minute I...

35:50.396 --> 35:51.930
I couldn't make it down the stairs,

35:51.932 --> 35:53.834
so I thought I'd just take a rest.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.671
Come on, Mr. Gianelli.

35:59.673 --> 36:02.908
We gotta get out of here before
this whole place collapses.

36:02.910 --> 36:05.611
I heard on the news on my little radio here

36:05.613 --> 36:07.345
before the battery went dead.

36:07.347 --> 36:12.084
They were saying that this
might just be a foreshock.

36:12.086 --> 36:14.352
That the whole city could collapse.

36:14.354 --> 36:18.059
They were talking about
maybe tidal waves even.

36:19.626 --> 36:23.396
It's okay. It's okay,
Cassie. We're almost down.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.497
Hey. Hey. Don't you worry, little miss.

36:25.499 --> 36:28.966
We're gonna be out of here in
two shakes of a lamb's tail.

36:28.968 --> 36:31.405
Okay? I guarantee ya.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.843
Come on. Let's go.

36:58.965 --> 37:02.035
Great. Now, what do we do?

37:06.006 --> 37:07.976
Try the phone again.

37:10.244 --> 37:14.148
Wait. Turn off your flashlight for second.

37:16.117 --> 37:18.950
What's going on?

37:18.952 --> 37:21.221
Look. We're there.

37:22.956 --> 37:26.326
We just need to get this out of the way.

37:38.338 --> 37:40.838
Nice guns.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.341
You ever do martial arts?

37:42.343 --> 37:46.245
Took a Krav Maga intro
once. That's about it.

37:46.247 --> 37:48.747
I teach jujitsu, if you ever
want to try something different.

37:48.749 --> 37:51.285
It's the end of the
world and your marketing?

37:58.825 --> 38:02.130
Cassie! Kaley!

38:07.001 --> 38:11.068
It's okay. I'm through. It's not that far.

38:11.070 --> 38:13.872
Come on. We're almost there.

38:13.874 --> 38:17.608
Well, I've been through
smaller foxhole then that.

38:17.610 --> 38:20.347
Of course that was sixty years ago.

38:21.581 --> 38:24.350
We'll get you through, Roberto.

38:24.352 --> 38:27.188
I'll pull, you push.

38:37.064 --> 38:39.100
Be careful.

38:40.367 --> 38:42.070
Come on.

38:45.939 --> 38:47.606
Alright.

38:47.608 --> 38:48.907
Hurry.

38:48.909 --> 38:52.012
Alright. Here I come.

38:54.014 --> 38:56.283
You go next.

38:58.820 --> 39:00.251
- Go on.
- No. You're next.

39:00.253 --> 39:01.986
I don't want to be responsible for those

39:01.988 --> 39:04.189
girls losing another mother.

39:04.191 --> 39:08.029
Go on, Wicked Stepmother.

39:11.197 --> 39:13.133
Other leg!

39:21.742 --> 39:23.211
Aurora!

39:33.854 --> 39:36.224
Hey. Here you go.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.461
Alright.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.562
Rodney Jackson.

39:43.564 --> 39:47.402
Matt. Matt Mason. This is my son, Ricky.

39:52.738 --> 39:53.939
You saved our lives.

39:53.941 --> 39:56.408
No, no, no.

39:56.410 --> 39:58.813
Your dad here saved your life.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.416
I just leant a hand.

40:03.383 --> 40:05.883
No, he's right. We owe you.

40:05.885 --> 40:12.256
Well, wouldn't turn down a
ride. A tree landed on my car.

40:12.258 --> 40:14.195
I was walking out when I heard you shout.

40:15.496 --> 40:18.262
You got it. And anything else you need.

40:18.264 --> 40:20.932
Well, I appreciate that.

40:20.934 --> 40:22.501
The roads are pretty smashed up.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.537
You got four-wheel drive?

40:24.539 --> 40:27.138
Oh, yeah, we do.

40:27.140 --> 40:28.807
Oh, yeah.

40:28.809 --> 40:30.742
Yeah? You got four-wheel drive? Alright!

40:30.744 --> 40:31.977
Alright.

40:44.157 --> 40:46.393
Whoa! Sick ride.

41:17.957 --> 41:19.825
We got to go.

41:19.827 --> 41:22.928
- May, we have to go!
- Go on, I'll catch up.

41:22.930 --> 41:25.329
- May!
- I'll be right there.

41:25.331 --> 41:29.300
Leave her be, Miss.
She just needs a minute.

41:29.302 --> 41:31.605
Come on, Johanna.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.894
May!

42:21.454 --> 42:23.153
Hurry up.

42:23.155 --> 42:27.024
So dark matter passes through
the planet, leaves a hole,

42:27.026 --> 42:29.227
but no explosion?

42:29.229 --> 42:30.629
It doesn't really make any sense.

42:30.631 --> 42:32.963
Not now. But once we study the telemetry we

42:32.965 --> 42:34.566
might understand it.

42:34.568 --> 42:36.669
And learn a lot about gravity
and the nature of the universe,

42:36.671 --> 42:37.869
in the process.

42:37.871 --> 42:40.405
It's like a bullet that
passes through Jell-O.

42:40.407 --> 42:43.341
Except the Earth has
got a warm, melty center.

42:43.343 --> 42:45.276
More like a cream egg?

42:45.278 --> 42:48.046
And now the cream is filling in the hole.

42:48.048 --> 42:50.247
That's good, right?

42:50.249 --> 42:52.783
It's the heat of all that deep
core magma that worries me.

42:52.785 --> 42:53.921
Look at that!

42:59.325 --> 43:00.959
Give me an estimate of wave height.

43:00.961 --> 43:03.961
This is Dr. Picciotto at Arecibo.

43:03.963 --> 43:05.997
We're tracking a mega
tsunami radiating from

43:05.999 --> 43:08.198
the Arctic south through the Pacific.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.600
It's over one hundred feet.

43:09.602 --> 43:12.137
Estimated wave height at
least one hundred feet.

43:12.139 --> 43:16.677
My god, it can take out
the whole Pacific Coast.

43:39.733 --> 43:41.599
Duck. Duck.

43:41.601 --> 43:43.535
She could have gotten out.

43:43.537 --> 43:45.403
She's with her friend now.

43:45.405 --> 43:48.240
"Friend? You mean wife, don't ya?"

43:48.242 --> 43:49.675
I guess so.

43:49.677 --> 43:51.343
We need to get you girls someplace safe.

43:51.345 --> 43:54.479
What? No. Dad said if we ever
got separated in an emergency,

43:54.481 --> 43:55.780
to meet at home.

43:55.782 --> 43:57.349
Matt's not here. And our home is gone.

43:57.351 --> 43:58.684
Well, if we stay where we can see it,

43:58.686 --> 44:01.285
when he comes home we'll see him.

44:01.287 --> 44:03.854
Do you think there was an
earthquake in the mountains too?

44:03.856 --> 44:04.923
I don't know.

44:04.925 --> 44:07.292
But maybe we should get it out of the city.

44:07.294 --> 44:09.327
The cops won't be able to handle this.

44:09.329 --> 44:10.928
Yeah, you got that right. Once
people get it into their minds

44:10.930 --> 44:12.463
they can get away with something.

44:12.465 --> 44:14.332
Even food and water will be scarce.

44:14.334 --> 44:17.401
No. No! We are staying here.

44:20.606 --> 44:22.006
Come on. Let's go.

44:22.008 --> 44:25.742
No! We have to stay here.

44:25.744 --> 44:28.912
I wish I had that stupid
walkie-talkie Dad bought me.

44:28.914 --> 44:31.550
That's right. Matt has that
old shortwave in the Humvee.

44:31.552 --> 44:33.050
If we could find a HAM radio...

44:33.052 --> 44:35.320
There's an electronics store up the street.

44:35.322 --> 44:37.655
There is? Can you show me, girls?

44:37.657 --> 44:40.360
- Alright. Quickly. Go.
- Okay.

44:41.427 --> 44:42.762
Come on.

44:50.102 --> 44:52.970
Hey, call your... Johanna.

44:52.972 --> 44:56.610
- My phone was in the tent.
- Damn it. So was mine.

44:57.912 --> 45:00.512
Here you go.

45:00.514 --> 45:02.849
I don't know her number.

45:04.318 --> 45:05.816
What? It was in the memory.

45:05.818 --> 45:09.320
- 3-1-0-2-2-6...
- It doesn't matter. No service.

45:09.322 --> 45:12.125
Alright. Try an emergency band.

45:13.660 --> 45:15.994
<i>An earthquake measuring 9.2 on the</i>

45:15.996 --> 45:18.497
<i>Richter scale has hit Los Angeles.</i>

45:18.499 --> 45:21.533
<i>There have been scattered
reports from other countries</i>

45:21.535 --> 45:24.401
<i>indicating this may
be a global disaster.</i>

45:24.403 --> 45:27.338
<i>Blackouts blanket the L.A. area
and we're getting unconfirmed</i>

45:27.340 --> 45:29.807
<i>reports of large-scale movement.</i>

45:29.809 --> 45:31.709
<i>Authorities are warning
residents to shelter in place</i>

45:31.711 --> 45:33.778
<i>and to avoid large cities.</i>

45:33.780 --> 45:37.148
<i>HAM radios are reporting that a
meteor may have struck Alaska.</i>

45:37.150 --> 45:39.483
<i>But we have no confirmation
of that. Again, avoid...</i>

45:39.485 --> 45:41.486
- Maybe we should stay up here.
- No. I don't think this mountain

45:41.488 --> 45:43.155
is completely stable.

45:43.157 --> 45:45.726
Look. Doesn't matter. We gotta
get back to the girls. Alright?

45:48.729 --> 45:51.665
Try this shortwave. Shortwave band.

45:53.334 --> 45:55.300
<i>And that's what I've been
saying all these years.</i>

45:55.302 --> 45:57.736
<i>Something like this was going
to happen, and civilization</i>

45:57.738 --> 46:00.338
<i>would be over just like that.</i>

46:00.340 --> 46:01.840
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

46:01.842 --> 46:04.207
Does anybody know what's happened?

46:04.209 --> 46:06.378
<i>And now, just wait, the
government will declare</i>

46:06.380 --> 46:10.481
<i>martial law and start
rounding us up. You'll see.</i>

46:10.483 --> 46:12.917
Try 2160.

46:12.919 --> 46:14.421
Okay.

46:15.456 --> 46:16.791
Here.

46:18.724 --> 46:24.095
W9GFO. W9GFO. This is
W7THX, do you read me?

46:24.097 --> 46:26.901
No way she's going to
remember her call sign.

46:28.836 --> 46:33.070
Kaley Mason, this is Dad. Do you read me?

46:33.072 --> 46:34.908
Maybe when we get out of the forest.

46:36.510 --> 46:38.575
<i>Mayday. Can anyone there?...</i>

46:38.577 --> 46:40.611
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

46:50.657 --> 46:53.561
- Kaley Mason...
- Dad, look out!

47:12.412 --> 47:17.080
It's like the entire city
just evacuated at once.

47:17.082 --> 47:18.218
Oh, God.

47:19.919 --> 47:24.592
W9GFO. Johanna. Kaley.
It's Matt, do you hear me?

47:26.825 --> 47:28.727
We're never going to get home this way.

47:28.729 --> 47:30.428
Oh, no, no, no.

47:30.430 --> 47:32.430
We got to get down.

47:32.432 --> 47:34.798
I was studying this mountain.
I'm a geologist at Caltech.

47:34.800 --> 47:39.873
If it keeps shaking we could
be in real trouble here.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.341
A back road, maybe?

47:43.343 --> 47:45.279
Good work, son. Which way?

47:46.914 --> 47:48.249
There.

48:03.097 --> 48:04.762
Johanna, come on.

48:04.764 --> 48:05.963
The electronic store is right up here.

48:05.965 --> 48:08.601
I got to get these girls out of this.

48:10.302 --> 48:11.638
Come on.

48:18.646 --> 48:20.343
Doesn't this make us looters too?

48:20.345 --> 48:23.615
We'll come back and pay for them tomorrow.

48:28.956 --> 48:30.354
Maybe we should go around back?

48:30.356 --> 48:32.490
- Go! Go!
- Come on. We gotta go.

48:32.492 --> 48:33.827
Come on.

48:39.365 --> 48:40.901
It's right up there.

48:46.072 --> 48:47.838
Ugh! Now what?

48:47.840 --> 48:52.176
Have any of you got a
paperclip or a hairpin?

48:52.178 --> 48:53.778
Or something like that?

48:53.780 --> 48:55.115
Yeah.

48:56.983 --> 48:59.216
There we go.

48:59.218 --> 49:00.450
Alright.

49:00.452 --> 49:02.120
Look out. Look out.

49:02.122 --> 49:04.155
Step aside.

49:04.157 --> 49:05.923
Alright.

49:05.925 --> 49:07.126
Okay.

49:19.238 --> 49:22.640
I wasn't always an old man, you know.

49:22.642 --> 49:24.142
Go on. After you.

49:26.146 --> 49:27.715
Alright.

49:34.354 --> 49:38.256
Guys, I have a real bad feeling about this.

49:38.258 --> 49:39.927
Drive faster.

49:51.472 --> 49:53.637
Hmm. It says you need a license.

49:53.639 --> 49:54.972
Yeah, I have one.

49:54.974 --> 49:59.811
This is W9GFO calling W7THX, over.

49:59.813 --> 50:01.546
I'm impressed.

50:01.548 --> 50:04.515
Yeah. Well, passing that stupid
test was one of the last thing

50:04.517 --> 50:06.584
I did with my mom.

50:06.586 --> 50:08.720
W7THX, do you read?

50:08.722 --> 50:10.224
Dad?

50:13.459 --> 50:15.662
Maybe we can try from up there.

50:21.468 --> 50:24.535
It's gonna be alright.

50:24.537 --> 50:29.640
<i>This is W9GFO calling
Matt Mason, W7THX, over.</i>

50:29.642 --> 50:30.977
Kaley? Is that you?

50:32.077 --> 50:33.213
Dad!

50:42.789 --> 50:46.124
It's a nice vehicle you got there.

50:46.126 --> 50:47.861
We're gonna need it.

50:48.994 --> 50:50.897
Alright. Stay in the car.

50:51.831 --> 50:53.700
No matter what.

51:00.506 --> 51:02.075
You two, out!

51:03.677 --> 51:06.311
Hey. I'm Matt.

51:06.313 --> 51:08.213
That's my son Ricky, and that's Rodney.

51:08.215 --> 51:10.314
Yeah. I don't care about introductions.

51:10.316 --> 51:12.182
I said, get out of the vehicle!

51:12.184 --> 51:14.084
Hey look, we got a winch in there.

51:14.086 --> 51:15.952
Maybe we could help you.
We'd be happy to pull

51:15.954 --> 51:17.387
your truck out the ditch.

51:17.389 --> 51:18.990
The radiator's busted. Have you got any...

51:18.992 --> 51:21.559
That truck ain't going nowhere, Oliver.

51:21.561 --> 51:23.497
We're taking yours.

51:24.697 --> 51:26.865
Stop!

51:30.137 --> 51:31.736
Stop!

51:31.738 --> 51:33.974
I said, you two out of the car!

51:39.646 --> 51:41.180
Dad.

51:42.881 --> 51:44.918
Your dad knows what he's doing.

51:46.552 --> 51:48.186
It doesn't seem like it.

51:48.188 --> 51:52.789
Come on, man. I'm just trying
to get my kid back to the city.

51:52.791 --> 51:55.760
Back to his mom and my daughters.

51:55.762 --> 51:57.028
We could take you with us.

51:57.030 --> 51:58.662
No. There's not enough room.

51:58.664 --> 52:01.198
Besides, you're a fool if
you're going back to the city.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.867
- Maybe they can come with us.
- Shut up!

52:02.869 --> 52:04.068
We just need to rendezvous with the...

52:04.070 --> 52:06.206
Shut up, Oliver!

52:08.541 --> 52:10.043
Come on. Please.

52:21.755 --> 52:23.122
Oh.

52:59.092 --> 53:00.894
What are you doing?

53:01.827 --> 53:03.162
Dad?

53:07.800 --> 53:10.200
Dad, no.

53:10.202 --> 53:12.171
It's the right thing to do.

53:13.939 --> 53:16.073
Let's go.

53:16.075 --> 53:17.874
This is just like her.

53:17.876 --> 53:21.014
You have to put your children first.

53:34.660 --> 53:36.195
Drop the guns.

53:37.463 --> 53:39.632
Come on. Get in! Just leave the guns.

53:50.010 --> 53:51.742
Thank you so much!

53:51.744 --> 53:53.311
The name's Oliver.

53:53.313 --> 53:57.084
Come on. Come on. Hurry up.

54:20.206 --> 54:21.909
Kaley, are you there?

54:23.142 --> 54:25.945
Alright, so where's this
other truck of yours?

54:35.255 --> 54:36.620
Dad, are you there?

54:36.622 --> 54:41.124
W7THX this is W9GFO, do you read me?

54:41.126 --> 54:43.827
That's it, Mr. Gianelli.
You're almost there.

54:43.829 --> 54:45.963
You're doing great.

54:45.965 --> 54:47.365
Did you reach him?

54:47.367 --> 54:48.865
Not yet!

54:48.867 --> 54:50.066
It's okay, honey.

54:50.068 --> 54:51.535
You're in the line of sight.

54:51.537 --> 54:53.037
Are you sure you're on the right frequency?

54:56.108 --> 54:58.477
It's Kaley, Dad. Over.

55:00.313 --> 55:04.582
Oy vey. I shouldn't
have quit my Zumba class.

55:04.584 --> 55:07.084
Mr. Gianelli, I'll do Zumba
classes with you any time!

55:10.789 --> 55:13.226
You should go with your
daughters. I'm fine. Go.

55:14.494 --> 55:17.197
They're not actually my daughters.

55:18.164 --> 55:20.200
Aren't they?

55:21.334 --> 55:22.469
Eh?

55:24.003 --> 55:25.338
Go on.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.374
Anyone?

55:29.843 --> 55:32.209
Can you make a reservation
to Club Med on that thing?

55:32.211 --> 55:35.278
I think we're all going to
need a vacation after this.

55:35.280 --> 55:37.080
How about Disney World?

55:37.082 --> 55:39.582
Dork.

55:39.584 --> 55:42.218
Look around. Disney World's toast.

55:42.220 --> 55:43.421
- Kaley!
- What?

55:43.423 --> 55:44.622
People are talking about it.

55:44.624 --> 55:46.057
It's happening all over the world.

55:46.059 --> 55:49.494
Earth was hit by some meteor or something.

55:49.496 --> 55:51.294
Everywhere?

55:51.296 --> 55:52.863
Not everywhere, Cassie.

55:52.865 --> 55:55.533
We know your dad's fine.
We just heard from him.

55:55.535 --> 55:57.204
Try again.

55:58.805 --> 56:01.372
<i>W9GFO, this is W7THX.</i>

56:01.374 --> 56:03.039
<i>Kaley, do you read me?</i>

56:03.041 --> 56:04.240
It's Dad!

56:04.242 --> 56:06.378
Dad! Dad, are you okay?

56:06.380 --> 56:07.611
Is Ricky?

56:07.613 --> 56:09.347
<i>Don't worry. We're okay.</i>

56:09.349 --> 56:12.082
<i>Are you with your sister?</i>

56:12.084 --> 56:13.850
<i>Is Johanna with you?</i>

56:13.852 --> 56:16.620
Yeah. Yeah. We're all together,
but the building collapsed.

56:16.622 --> 56:21.327
You say the building collapsed?
Everybody's okay? Nobody's hurt?

56:22.928 --> 56:26.263
Matt. Matt. We're all together.
We're fine. Where are you?

56:32.104 --> 56:34.472
Matt, the city is not safe.

56:34.474 --> 56:36.307
There's a lot of of rubble

56:36.309 --> 56:37.707
and people are getting out of control.

56:37.709 --> 56:39.977
I need to get these girls someplace safe.

56:39.979 --> 56:42.816
<i>Say again? Where safe?</i>

56:45.351 --> 56:47.421
Matt, where are you?

56:48.954 --> 56:50.954
Matt, are you there?

56:50.956 --> 56:54.527
W7THX, this is Kaley, over.

56:57.329 --> 56:59.028
We know where he is.

56:59.030 --> 57:00.865
He's coming down Route 38.

57:00.867 --> 57:03.600
Okay. We'll just have to head that way.

57:03.602 --> 57:04.667
Come on.

57:04.669 --> 57:07.403
No! No! Dad said we need to meet at home!

57:07.405 --> 57:09.273
We couldn't hear what he said.

57:09.275 --> 57:13.244
Johanna? Isn't the car under,
like, a million tons of rubble?

57:13.246 --> 57:16.115
How could we go anywhere anyhow?

57:17.150 --> 57:19.186
Maybe we can find some bicycles.

57:40.506 --> 57:42.876
I wish there was
something more we could do.

57:44.410 --> 57:46.276
Tsunami warnings are being activated.

57:46.278 --> 57:48.745
The USGS is monitoring the seismic quakes.

57:48.747 --> 57:51.347
The U.S. military is
getting it's act together to

57:51.349 --> 57:53.751
start relief operations.

57:53.753 --> 57:56.986
We're just an observatory. We're observing.

57:56.988 --> 58:01.658
I know. I said I wish
there was more we could do.

58:06.064 --> 58:08.467
So many people must be dying today.

58:13.171 --> 58:17.341
So how does someone end up
with the name Rajesh Vasquez?

58:17.343 --> 58:21.144
Was your mother Indian
and your dad Mexican?

58:21.146 --> 58:23.215
Yeah.

58:25.485 --> 58:27.986
And how does someone of Chinese descent,

58:27.988 --> 58:30.320
I'm guessing from, what,
the Shandong province,

58:30.322 --> 58:32.722
end up with the name like Noah Smith?

58:32.724 --> 58:36.630
Noah Smith is a very
traditional Chinese name.

58:41.901 --> 58:45.236
I was adopted. And it
was the Jiangsu province.

58:45.238 --> 58:47.303
Oh. Okay. Okay.

58:47.305 --> 58:48.872
I'm glad we cleared that up.

58:48.874 --> 58:51.441
Me too.

58:54.046 --> 58:55.345
Oh!

58:55.347 --> 58:56.814
What's going on?

58:56.816 --> 58:58.381
The weather satellites are going crazy.

58:58.383 --> 59:00.450
Looks like the superheated air created by

59:00.452 --> 59:02.919
the magma filling in the
hole is negatively charged.

59:02.921 --> 59:06.423
It's spin is creating static
discharges in the thermosphere.

59:06.425 --> 59:07.725
What does that mean?

59:07.727 --> 59:09.260
The mother of all electrical storms.

59:09.262 --> 59:10.961
Send this to the Pentagon.

59:10.963 --> 59:12.629
The same thing's happening
on the other side of the world

59:12.631 --> 59:14.434
with a positive charge.

59:28.079 --> 59:32.416
Our rendezvous with the rest of
our group is about a mile ahead.

59:32.418 --> 59:35.285
Alright, I'm not going to have
trouble with this guy, am I?

59:35.287 --> 59:37.521
You saved our lives when
you had no reason to.

59:37.523 --> 59:39.657
You seem to know what you're
doing, and I'm guessing

59:39.659 --> 59:41.628
this vehicle can go
anywhere and do anything.

59:44.396 --> 59:46.830
You'd be welcome to join
us. All three of you.

59:46.832 --> 59:48.465
We got a bunker in the
desert. It used to be

59:48.467 --> 59:50.300
an old missile silo.

59:50.302 --> 59:53.838
We got weapons and food
and water to last years.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.439
Nah. I got to get back
to my family. Thanks.

59:55.441 --> 59:58.274
Well, the offer stands.

59:58.276 --> 01:00:00.443
Bring your family.

01:00:00.445 --> 01:00:01.979
I'll come with you.

01:00:01.981 --> 01:00:04.314
If what we heard happened
actually happened,

01:00:04.316 --> 01:00:05.582
things are gonna get a lot worse before

01:00:05.584 --> 01:00:07.084
they get any better.

01:00:07.086 --> 01:00:08.952
Earthquakes and volcanoes
all over the world.

01:00:08.954 --> 01:00:10.854
That's a lot of ash and dust in the sky.

01:00:10.856 --> 01:00:12.525
Which can cause a nuclear winter.

01:00:13.593 --> 01:00:15.626
Plus the power grids are down.

01:00:15.628 --> 01:00:18.662
It could be years before
electricity is restored everywhere.

01:00:18.664 --> 01:00:21.097
And you just know some
fool is going to use us

01:00:21.099 --> 01:00:23.702
as an excuse to start a war.

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.937
I think a bunker...

01:00:26.939 --> 01:00:29.539
a bunker in the desert
sounds like a good idea.

01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:31.341
There's no telling what'll happen next.

01:00:31.343 --> 01:00:33.579
What the hell is that?

01:00:39.485 --> 01:00:41.421
That can't be good.

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:04.173
It looks like it's only hitting
the surface at volcanic events.

01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:06.843
Some kind of current
flow through the mantle?

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.979
- I've lost telemetry.
- Me too.

01:01:09.981 --> 01:01:12.552
It's frying the satellites! Damn!

01:01:23.162 --> 01:01:24.660
Is that Dad's mountain?

01:01:24.662 --> 01:01:26.632
Of course not, honey.

01:01:30.336 --> 01:01:33.671
Don't worry about your dad.
He knows what he's doing.

01:01:35.374 --> 01:01:36.840
We've got to get off this roof.

01:01:36.842 --> 01:01:39.609
But we can see where our
building was from here.

01:01:39.611 --> 01:01:41.678
We'll be able to tell when Dad gets back.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.149
We at least need to get you undercover.

01:01:51.957 --> 01:01:55.291
Girls, we can't stay here.
The city is the worst place

01:01:55.293 --> 01:01:56.861
to be in a disaster.

01:01:56.863 --> 01:02:00.564
There are too many people.
People who are desperate. Okay?

01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:02.300
You, Kaley, you know what can happens

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.934
when people lose control, right?

01:02:03.936 --> 01:02:05.436
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

01:02:05.438 --> 01:02:07.004
But we need to meet up with Dad.

01:02:07.006 --> 01:02:09.573
And we will. We just need
to move closer were the

01:02:09.575 --> 01:02:11.075
radio reception is better.

01:02:11.077 --> 01:02:14.412
We have to keep moving
there. Closer to him.

01:02:19.017 --> 01:02:21.952
Matt! Matt Mason!

01:02:21.954 --> 01:02:23.220
Are you there?

01:02:23.222 --> 01:02:28.128
W7... I can't! Dad! It's Kaley, over!

01:02:47.713 --> 01:02:50.347
What happened? Where's your truck?

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:53.684
Long story. This is Matt
and his son Rick, and Rodney.

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:55.452
They saved us from the lava.

01:02:55.454 --> 01:02:56.954
- Lava?
- Yeah. It's coming this way.

01:02:56.956 --> 01:02:58.655
- We gotta go.
- Rodney's joining us.

01:02:58.657 --> 01:03:00.323
I've invited Matt and his family too.

01:03:00.325 --> 01:03:01.791
Okay. Everyone's in the back.

01:03:01.793 --> 01:03:04.128
What the hell happened to him?

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:05.829
Same long story.

01:03:05.831 --> 01:03:10.502
If you find your family, we'll
be monitoring on 3.4 megahertz.

01:03:12.338 --> 01:03:15.138
- Thank you.
- No, thank you!

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.476
Let's go!

01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:20.109
Good luck. Keep your heads down.

01:03:20.111 --> 01:03:21.178
Alright. You too.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.579
Thanks for saving our lives, Rodney.

01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:25.548
- Anytime.
- Come on.

01:03:38.262 --> 01:03:39.495
W9GFO, are you there?

01:03:39.497 --> 01:03:40.997
How are we going to get to the girls?

01:03:40.999 --> 01:03:42.966
Remember what I told
you in case of emergency?

01:03:42.968 --> 01:03:44.568
Meet at home.

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:46.604
I'm sure they remember too. Okay.

01:03:46.606 --> 01:03:50.240
No one can protect them like
Johanna can. She's fierce.

01:03:50.242 --> 01:03:51.508
Fierce is good?

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:52.742
Fierce is very good.

01:03:52.744 --> 01:03:55.312
Oh, sh...

01:04:07.325 --> 01:04:08.658
No!

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:11.160
It's okay, Cassie. It's okay.

01:04:11.162 --> 01:04:14.733
Your dad was coming down
a long time ago. He's fine.

01:04:16.202 --> 01:04:17.968
You said that wasn't even his mountain.

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:20.338
Of course that's the
mountain! You've been there!

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.638
Kaley!

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.640
She's just trying to protect you!

01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:26.443
She's always trying to protect you!

01:04:26.445 --> 01:04:30.146
Why is she the one you're
always protecting, and never me?

01:04:30.148 --> 01:04:33.149
The minute you came into
our lives, it was always her!

01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:36.686
I was just treating you like an adult.

01:04:36.688 --> 01:04:39.523
I thought that's what you wanted.

01:04:39.525 --> 01:04:42.392
You knew I went out last night,

01:04:42.394 --> 01:04:44.663
and you didn't even care.

01:04:47.733 --> 01:04:49.836
You haven't said anything.

01:04:52.838 --> 01:04:55.742
You know, I wish Dad never married you.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:02.379
I thought...

01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:03.750
I...

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:08.818
I was just trying to be your friend, Kaley.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.657
Not judge you.

01:05:17.296 --> 01:05:21.898
Look. I knew that I could
never be your mother,

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.399
so I was just trying to be your friend.

01:05:23.401 --> 01:05:25.501
No. No! Don't you get it?

01:05:25.503 --> 01:05:27.606
I need a mom.

01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:39.586
Especially now.

01:05:40.785 --> 01:05:43.055
I don't have a dad.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.479
<i>This is the emergency alert system.</i>

01:06:09.481 --> 01:06:12.849
<i>This is not a test.
Following a celestial impact</i>

01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:14.452
<i>in northern Alaska,</i>

01:06:14.454 --> 01:06:17.053
<i>a catastrophic tsunami
warning has been issued</i>

01:06:17.055 --> 01:06:20.189
<i>for the entire west coast
of the United States.</i>

01:06:20.191 --> 01:06:24.327
<i>A wave exceeding 100 feet in
height may inundate coastal</i>

01:06:24.329 --> 01:06:27.463
<i>areas as far inland as 30 miles.</i>

01:06:27.465 --> 01:06:31.300
<i>The Pacific Northwest should
expect imminent landfall.</i>

01:06:31.302 --> 01:06:35.171
<i>Southern California, including
Los Angeles, should expect</i>

01:06:35.173 --> 01:06:37.073
<i>the wave within 30 minutes.</i>

01:06:37.075 --> 01:06:40.244
<i>Residents are urged to seek
high ground immediately.</i>

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.611
<i>This has been the
emergency alert system.</i>

01:06:42.613 --> 01:06:44.851
<i>This is not a test.</i>

01:07:06.438 --> 01:07:08.037
What do we do?

01:07:08.039 --> 01:07:10.874
I mean, even if we had a car,
the freeways will be jammed.

01:07:10.876 --> 01:07:13.246
Everywhere will be jammed.

01:07:14.313 --> 01:07:16.079
Come on.

01:07:16.081 --> 01:07:18.115
If we leave, how will we find Dad?

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:19.615
There's no time for that, Cassie.

01:07:19.617 --> 01:07:21.318
If we stay here, we die.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:25.421
If we could get to the
airport or find a helicopter.

01:07:25.423 --> 01:07:27.591
- Ladies.
- Can you fly, too?

01:07:27.593 --> 01:07:29.228
Ladies!

01:07:30.628 --> 01:07:32.329
Perhaps this is your solution.

01:07:32.331 --> 01:07:33.765
Huh?

01:07:39.572 --> 01:07:40.903
- Yes.
- Eh?

01:07:40.905 --> 01:07:43.041
Alright. Come on, girls.
We got to get down.

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:48.812
W7THX, this is W9GFO,
transmitting in the clear.

01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:51.914
Matt, there's a giant tsunami
heading towards Los Angeles.

01:07:51.916 --> 01:07:53.416
We're bugging out.

01:07:53.418 --> 01:07:56.486
Meet us in the hills where
we had our third date.

01:07:56.488 --> 01:07:59.890
I repeat, meet us in the
hills where we first...

01:07:59.892 --> 01:08:04.130
had a picnic. W9GFO out.

01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:07.497
Mr. Gianelli, come on.

01:08:07.499 --> 01:08:10.334
Whoa, now, hold on, hold
on. Before you get started.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:13.135
I am not gonna be able to ride
a motorcycle through the city

01:08:13.137 --> 01:08:14.937
on the brink of chaos,

01:08:14.939 --> 01:08:16.805
let alone slow on a driveway.

01:08:16.808 --> 01:08:18.475
And I'm certainly not
going to be able to make it

01:08:18.477 --> 01:08:19.676
down that ladder.

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:20.910
I'll help you.

01:08:20.912 --> 01:08:22.915
I'll slow you down.

01:08:24.282 --> 01:08:26.283
But...

01:08:26.285 --> 01:08:28.184
Listen.

01:08:28.185 --> 01:08:30.787
You've got those two girls to take care of.

01:08:30.788 --> 01:08:33.024
So don't you worry about me.

01:08:37.362 --> 01:08:39.462
You'll die.

01:08:39.464 --> 01:08:41.064
Hey! What's going on?

01:08:41.066 --> 01:08:47.970
Listen to me. I'm going
to be just fine. Okay?

01:08:47.973 --> 01:08:50.305
I thank you very much for getting me out

01:08:50.308 --> 01:08:52.109
of that old, dark stairwell.

01:08:52.111 --> 01:08:54.743
I think it's better to have
the sun on my face, huh?

01:08:54.746 --> 01:08:56.578
Come on!

01:08:58.317 --> 01:08:59.886
Go on.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.995
I think that's pretty well worth it!

01:09:14.532 --> 01:09:16.134
What about him?

01:09:30.515 --> 01:09:32.180
Cassie, you come with me.

01:09:32.183 --> 01:09:34.184
Kaley, it's like that
time we did motocross.

01:09:34.185 --> 01:09:35.752
It's not that different from your scooter.

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:37.288
Yeah. Don't worry, I got this.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.426
You're too late.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.298
Those your bikes?

01:09:48.901 --> 01:09:50.836
They are now.

01:09:55.907 --> 01:09:57.440
Forget about it, honey.

01:09:57.442 --> 01:09:59.912
I'm taking the other one to my buddy.

01:10:04.081 --> 01:10:06.015
Maybe we could work something out?

01:10:06.017 --> 01:10:08.952
Come along with you.

01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:11.023
Keep you company.

01:10:17.263 --> 01:10:18.861
Just you.

01:10:18.863 --> 01:10:21.601
Don't need no kids slowing me down.

01:10:23.268 --> 01:10:26.639
And you'd better be good company too.

01:10:51.429 --> 01:10:52.932
Come on!

01:11:09.581 --> 01:11:11.284
Oh, my God!

01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:14.954
You're like Wonder Woman!

01:11:22.428 --> 01:11:23.696
Okay.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.199
We got to get out of this traffic,

01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:39.237
get up into the hills.

01:12:55.452 --> 01:12:57.756
Let's try the freeway.

01:15:12.691 --> 01:15:14.024
Come on.

01:15:14.026 --> 01:15:16.595
Go. Go! Come on, hurry!

01:15:17.696 --> 01:15:19.465
Let's go.

01:15:44.555 --> 01:15:46.521
Come on. Almost there.

01:15:46.523 --> 01:15:48.393
Go.

01:15:50.394 --> 01:15:52.930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:52.932 --> 01:15:54.131
Mommy!

01:16:03.808 --> 01:16:05.244
Try the radio again.

01:16:06.644 --> 01:16:09.745
It must have fallen out somewhere.

01:16:09.747 --> 01:16:11.349
Dad.

01:16:31.268 --> 01:16:33.438
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:16:35.339 --> 01:16:37.573
- Come on, Cassie!
- Ricky!

01:16:37.575 --> 01:16:39.445
I missed you guys so much.

01:16:49.454 --> 01:16:51.053
You saved them.

01:16:51.055 --> 01:16:53.325
We saved each other.

01:16:55.094 --> 01:16:56.892
Okay.

01:16:56.894 --> 01:16:59.365
Oh, my God!

01:17:21.353 --> 01:17:23.586
Is anyone else seeing this?

01:17:23.588 --> 01:17:27.757
All the weather stations
north of L.A. are going crazy.

01:17:27.759 --> 01:17:29.891
And then just going dead.

01:17:29.893 --> 01:17:31.560
My god.

01:17:31.562 --> 01:17:34.163
The magma plug in the
hole must have collapsed.

01:17:34.165 --> 01:17:36.634
It's created a vortex that's
sucking in the atmosphere.

01:17:39.638 --> 01:17:42.070
It's expanding exponentially.

01:17:42.072 --> 01:17:43.538
The Coriolis effect
should dissipate it once it

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.208
expands to the equator.

01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:46.742
Okay.

01:17:46.744 --> 01:17:50.946
But first it will scour every
sign of life from the face

01:17:50.948 --> 01:17:52.550
of North America.

01:18:02.059 --> 01:18:04.194
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Go.

01:18:04.196 --> 01:18:06.663
Get in! Get in! Get in! Come
on. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:18:06.665 --> 01:18:09.599
Go, go, go, go. Come on! Get in.

01:18:09.601 --> 01:18:12.569
- Where are we going?
- The desert.

01:18:12.571 --> 01:18:14.471
We can't outrun that thing for long.

01:18:14.473 --> 01:18:16.439
We don't need long.

01:18:16.441 --> 01:18:18.410
We met some friends.

01:18:45.103 --> 01:18:46.502
Are you sure you know where you're going?

01:18:46.504 --> 01:18:47.770
Yeah. I got it! I got it!

01:18:47.772 --> 01:18:49.739
- Are you sure, Matt?
- I got it!

01:18:49.741 --> 01:18:51.777
What is this place?

01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:56.546
Alright. Just a little bit
further and we should be good.

01:18:56.548 --> 01:18:58.715
- Come on. Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

01:18:58.717 --> 01:19:00.717
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:19:00.719 --> 01:19:02.052
How are we doing over there?

01:19:02.054 --> 01:19:04.386
What are we looking for?

01:19:04.388 --> 01:19:07.925
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Matt, what are we looking for?

01:19:11.062 --> 01:19:12.294
Matt!

01:19:12.296 --> 01:19:13.896
Just hang on, girls. It'll be okay, okay?

01:19:13.898 --> 01:19:15.431
This is the place. It's got to be here.

01:19:15.433 --> 01:19:16.769
It's okay.

01:19:26.612 --> 01:19:28.614
Over there. I think that's it.

01:19:32.383 --> 01:19:33.583
- Faster!
- Almost there.

01:19:33.585 --> 01:19:36.351
- Dad! Go! Go!
- I mean it!

01:19:36.353 --> 01:19:38.087
Almost there! Almost there!

01:19:38.089 --> 01:19:39.556
Almost where?

01:19:39.558 --> 01:19:41.524
Ricky?

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:45.831
Sanctuary, sanctuary,
the Masons are inbound!

01:19:50.434 --> 01:19:53.002
- Where are you taking us?
- You wouldn't believe me

01:19:53.004 --> 01:19:54.206
if I told you.

01:20:19.496 --> 01:20:20.832
I missed you guys.

01:20:24.235 --> 01:20:25.501
Good work, Ricky.

01:20:25.503 --> 01:20:26.938
I love you, Dad.

01:21:14.786 --> 01:21:16.685
Gentlemen, how's that report coming?

01:21:16.687 --> 01:21:20.657
There's so much data from that
day, we're still collating.

01:21:20.659 --> 01:21:22.658
Well, what can you tell me
about dark matter now that

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.693
we didn't know a year ago?

01:21:24.695 --> 01:21:28.567
Uh, it's really bad.

01:21:29.933 --> 01:21:31.869
Keep up the good work.

01:21:45.549 --> 01:21:48.284
The latest seismographs show
the faults have stabilized.

01:21:48.286 --> 01:21:50.720
With the pressure released,
we won't see another earthquake

01:21:50.722 --> 01:21:52.221
for a hundred years.

01:21:52.223 --> 01:21:54.190
A hundred years. That's good news.

01:21:54.192 --> 01:21:56.325
We're able to start sending
scouting teams into the city,

01:21:56.327 --> 01:21:57.894
if you guys want to check on your home.

01:21:57.896 --> 01:22:00.032
Thanks. We'll let you know.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.869
Alright.

01:22:16.313 --> 01:22:19.649
What do you think, guys? You wanna go home?

01:22:19.651 --> 01:22:21.851
Everything we've ever known is gone.

01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:23.919
Yeah. I mean, I know
it was just a years ago,

01:22:23.921 --> 01:22:26.991
but it feels like a whole other world.

01:22:28.559 --> 01:22:30.592
I kinda like being a country girl.

01:22:32.562 --> 01:22:35.597
What do you think, Jo? You
want to go back to the city?

01:22:36.968 --> 01:22:39.935
It doesn't really matter where we go.

01:22:39.937 --> 01:22:43.073
So long as we do it as a family.

01:22:59.131 --> 01:23:04.131
