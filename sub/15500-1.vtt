00:07.974 --> 00:12.178
â™ª Pop Goes the Weasel

00:36.569 --> 00:38.204
- Looking back,

00:38.238 --> 00:43.143
I wonder sometimes if
my memory is flawed.

00:43.176 --> 00:44.744
I remember the
feeling of that day.

00:44.778 --> 00:49.115
The smell of my secondhand car.

00:49.149 --> 00:52.252
The sunshine from
the indian summer.

00:52.285 --> 00:55.155
That desperate
teenage hope that,

00:55.188 --> 00:58.158
in a few years it
would all get better.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.894
And it did get better,

01:00.927 --> 01:03.263
at least for me it did.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.867
Part of me thinks that Iris
stayed down there too long,

01:07.901 --> 01:10.770
and maybe it was something
in the air that got to her.

01:10.804 --> 01:14.174
That musty mist that
stayed on my clothes

01:14.207 --> 01:16.242
long after they were washed.

01:18.878 --> 01:20.747
A reminder...

01:21.314 --> 01:23.116
to feel guilty.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.263
- Hey Eddie, hey Derrick.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.231
- How ya doing kid?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.264
- Hey Iris.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.742
Hey, I found three
flashlights at my house

01:49.776 --> 01:50.777
and I brought one for ya.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.178
- Awesome, thanks.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.880
Hey, this has a
cute sticker on it.

01:53.913 --> 01:56.182
- Aw, just like my
cute little bro.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.519
- Hey guys!

01:59.552 --> 02:01.621
- Hey Caden, you're back!

02:03.423 --> 02:05.492
- You know, hay is for horses.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.408
- No, no, no.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.880
- You guys, seriously?

02:26.913 --> 02:28.715
I'm trying to drive.

02:29.782 --> 02:30.884
- Hey!

02:31.951 --> 02:35.321
- Am I really the only one
who knows where we're going?

02:35.355 --> 02:38.191
- Like mom would let
us go if she knew.

02:38.691 --> 02:42.529
- Well, all I'm saying is,
if you're not back on time,

02:42.562 --> 02:45.965
I'm not looking for you and
I'm not waiting for you.

03:11.424 --> 03:12.792
- Thanks for the ride Eddie!

03:12.825 --> 03:13.793
- Six o'clock!

03:13.826 --> 03:15.662
Don't be late!

03:18.665 --> 03:19.832
- Hey Marlene!

03:19.866 --> 03:20.833
- Hey Iris.

03:20.867 --> 03:21.668
- Hey Marlene, I can't
believe we're actually

03:21.701 --> 03:23.836
going to film inside
a crazy house.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.440
- It's not a crazy house,
it's called an asylum.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.642
- Ass-i-lum.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.277
- Hello to you too.

03:46.893 --> 03:47.961
Thanks.

03:47.994 --> 03:51.631
This grass is
giving me allergies.

03:51.664 --> 03:54.300
I brought flashlights
for everyone.

03:55.468 --> 03:56.970
- I'm good.

03:57.003 --> 03:57.804
- If we're going
to be underground,

03:57.837 --> 03:59.939
we're going to
need lots of light.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.542
- Whatever.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.982
It's broken.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.483
- Sorry.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.586
So, how'd you hear
about this place?

04:13.620 --> 04:15.331
- These high schoolers
were talking about it

04:15.355 --> 04:16.923
during bible study.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.959
They said it used to be a
big party place for drinking,

04:20.994 --> 04:23.763
until one night, like,
a super long time ago,

04:23.796 --> 04:25.965
one of the football
players went crazy.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.934
- What do you mean crazy?

04:27.967 --> 04:30.003
- He started screaming
about a bleeding cross

04:30.036 --> 04:32.005
and how he was being
chased by a nun.

04:32.038 --> 04:33.906
- Nuns are kinda creepy.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.942
- They're married to God.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.678
Anyways, he attacked his friends

04:38.711 --> 04:40.013
with a broken beer bottle,

04:40.046 --> 04:42.615
slashed his
girlfriend's neck so bad

04:42.649 --> 04:45.084
her head almost fell off.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.786
- Whoa.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.791
- What scene should
we shoot first?

04:53.059 --> 04:54.360
- I don't know.

04:54.394 --> 04:55.728
- It's gonna be so cool.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.096
- I know.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.833
Think it'll be all creepy?

05:05.605 --> 05:07.774
- What happened
to the rest of it?

05:07.807 --> 05:10.109
- It caught on fire
and burnt down.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.480
- It's real, I can't
believe it's actually here.

05:15.114 --> 05:16.416
- Yeah!

05:16.449 --> 05:18.818
Hey guys, I caught
a grasshopper!

05:19.719 --> 05:21.854
- Have you been inside it yet?

05:21.888 --> 05:24.691
- I'm not going in
there by myself.

05:24.724 --> 05:27.694
- Well, we're here
now, let's do this.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.637
- Really?

05:37.670 --> 05:38.950
You're just going
to stand there?

05:46.879 --> 05:49.615
- Wow, that's dark.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.952
You think these steps are okay?

05:53.686 --> 05:56.456
- I don't know about this, guys.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.467
There could be a law
against just being here.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.126
We're basically
trespassing, you know?

06:00.159 --> 06:02.462
- Only one way to find out!

06:02.495 --> 06:03.129
Woohoo!

06:03.162 --> 06:04.964
- Hey, be careful!

06:06.899 --> 06:08.067
Caden?

06:08.768 --> 06:10.036
Caden?

06:10.737 --> 06:11.437
Caden!

06:11.471 --> 06:12.638
- Yeah!

06:12.672 --> 06:14.941
This place is perfect
for a scary movie!

06:14.974 --> 06:16.075
- Caden!

06:16.109 --> 06:18.144
- Stop freaking us out!

06:18.811 --> 06:20.113
- Sorry.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.582
Come on, what are
we waiting for?

06:22.615 --> 06:24.016
Let's make a movie.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.586
- I think I'm gonna stay up here

06:26.619 --> 06:28.721
and stand guard in
case anyone comes.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.022
- Suit yourself.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.524
- What?

06:31.557 --> 06:32.525
Are you scared?

06:32.558 --> 06:33.960
- I'm not scared.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.028
- Have fun with your flashlight.

06:51.944 --> 06:55.615
- What is wrong with
you, you retard?

06:55.648 --> 06:56.916
- I'm sorry, it's just,

06:56.949 --> 06:58.851
it's colder down
here than I expected.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.787
I should've brought
an extra sweater.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.255
- Come on guys, let's not fight.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.257
We're here to make
a movie, okay?

07:04.290 --> 07:06.726
- That was seriously gross.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.895
- Derrick, shine the
light on Marlene's face.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.530
Marlene, I want you
to start back up

07:10.563 --> 07:11.831
at the top and come down.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.504
Caden, you're in charge
of the background noise.

07:18.538 --> 07:19.806
- Okay!

07:20.139 --> 07:21.974
- And, action!

07:44.130 --> 07:44.964
- Cut!

07:44.997 --> 07:46.232
Nice job, guys!

07:47.366 --> 07:50.069
- Hey guys, it's like a
miniature church in there!

07:50.102 --> 07:51.938
- Like, a chapel?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.105
- Whatever.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.807
- We can shoot the
next scene in there!

07:54.841 --> 07:56.209
I have a great idea.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.162
We can draw a pentagram
with the chalk I brought.

08:06.586 --> 08:07.586
- Yuck!

08:14.327 --> 08:15.795
- What?

08:15.828 --> 08:16.829
- Nothing.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.064
- What happened?

08:18.097 --> 08:21.133
- Nothing, I thought I heard
something, but it was nothing.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.936
Yeah, let's make a movie!

08:24.604 --> 08:25.304
- Should we really be drawing

08:25.338 --> 08:27.006
that kind of stuff in a church?

08:27.039 --> 08:29.842
- It's a chapel, whatever.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.712
If there's a God,
he should be helping

08:32.745 --> 08:35.681
starving children in
Somalia or something.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.659
- I wouldn't touch that if
I were you, it might be...

08:38.683 --> 08:39.919
- Might be what?

08:39.952 --> 08:41.621
- Ugh, get that
thing away from me.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.688
- Come on guys,
let's shoot this.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.294
- What are my lines again?

08:48.327 --> 08:49.896
- You don't remember your lines?

08:49.929 --> 08:51.831
- Shut up, you dork, I
have more lines than you.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.065
- You have six lines.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.867
- Six too many.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.068
- Here.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.072
- Thanks.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.910
- Marlene, help me move these.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.078
Caden...

09:39.812 --> 09:41.013
- Iris, hey.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.845
- Marlene, take a step back.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.914
Caden, we need
more light on her.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.853
- Hey what happened?

10:20.886 --> 10:23.022
- Are you okay?

10:23.055 --> 10:25.257
- I wanted to see what
was in the next room.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.859
- Did you fall?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.894
- Hm-mm, I guess I did.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.463
- You don't look so good.

10:30.496 --> 10:31.864
- I'm fine.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.333
Guys, can we get out of here?

10:34.367 --> 10:35.968
It's getting really cold.

10:36.002 --> 10:39.805
- But we haven't checked out
the rest of the ass-i-lum.

10:39.839 --> 10:40.973
- I'm not cold.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.310
- Ugh, this place
is covered in mold.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.912
I'm probably going to get sick
just by breathing down here.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.090
- We still have one
more scene down here

10:48.114 --> 10:49.815
before we can shoot
the scene in the woods.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.151
- I've got those
lines memorized.

10:53.352 --> 10:56.288
- Derrick, where are you going?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.823
Derrick?

10:58.924 --> 11:00.459
- This is bad.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.427
- I don't remember
seeing that door

11:01.460 --> 11:03.396
when we first came in here.

11:03.929 --> 11:06.232
- We are so observant.

11:06.866 --> 11:09.869
- She's right, I don't
remember seeing it either.

11:09.902 --> 11:11.737
Where did it come from?

11:11.771 --> 11:14.240
- It's really dark down here,
I bet we just missed it.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.742
- Let's just go back
up and get help.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.911
I have a bad feeling about this.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.055
- And leave Derrick down here?

11:20.079 --> 11:22.815
- Well, there's something
obviously wrong with him,

11:22.848 --> 11:24.817
like more than usual.

11:24.850 --> 11:25.985
- I'm going after him.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.387
- No, we have to stick together.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.955
What if you get lost too?

11:29.989 --> 11:31.891
- We'll be fine, just stay here.

11:31.924 --> 11:32.758
- And do what?

11:32.792 --> 11:34.193
Pray?

11:35.795 --> 11:37.763
You better not leave me here.

11:37.963 --> 11:39.799
Come on, come on.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.469
- Derrick.

11:43.502 --> 11:45.905
Hey Derrick.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.874
Where are you?

11:50.142 --> 11:53.312
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.181
Marco.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.049
No Polo, okay.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.492
- Come help me.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.368
- Marlene?

12:30.116 --> 12:31.217
Hey!

12:33.586 --> 12:36.188
Guys, let me out!

12:48.434 --> 12:50.069
- Derrick?

12:51.337 --> 12:52.337
Iris?

13:12.558 --> 13:13.826
Derrick?

13:15.494 --> 13:16.829
Iris?

13:19.665 --> 13:21.233
- Doesn't it feel
like we've been

13:21.267 --> 13:23.469
walking down this
hallway forever?

13:23.502 --> 13:26.972
- Yeah, maybe we
should turn back.

13:27.673 --> 13:30.543
- Just a little further,
I think I see the end.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.178
- Iris?

13:33.579 --> 13:35.181
- I think I see him!

13:35.548 --> 13:36.182
Derrick!

13:36.215 --> 13:37.850
Hey, Derrick!

13:38.050 --> 13:39.919
Why is he just standing there?

13:39.952 --> 13:42.321
Come on Caden, why
are you stopping?

13:43.455 --> 13:44.455
Caden?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.414
- Marlene!

14:08.447 --> 14:10.649
Marlene! Where are you?

14:10.683 --> 14:11.650
- Iris?

14:11.684 --> 14:12.651
- Can you see me?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.019
- Iris...

14:23.295 --> 14:24.530
Derrick?

14:24.563 --> 14:26.232
- What is that?

14:26.265 --> 14:27.466
- Where were you?

14:27.499 --> 14:29.501
- We have to get out
of here, where's Iris?

14:29.535 --> 14:30.536
- I'm here.

14:33.572 --> 14:34.572
- Run!

14:44.650 --> 14:46.318
- I said six o'clock.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.225
- What?

14:53.259 --> 14:54.593
- Where's the staircase?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.228
Did we take a wrong turn?

14:56.262 --> 14:59.598
- No, I remember this is
the way that we came in.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.300
It should be right here.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.935
- Guys look.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.304
- I don't remember
seeing that door.

15:05.337 --> 15:06.705
- Me neither.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.173
Maybe it's a way out.

15:08.207 --> 15:10.676
- Let's link hands so
we don't get separated.

15:12.711 --> 15:15.047
- Our father, who art in Heaven,

15:15.080 --> 15:16.482
hallowed be thy name.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.751
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.253
- I wish Caden were here.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.489
- You know he's
imaginary, right?

15:24.290 --> 15:27.159
- Yeah, but I feel
better when he's with me.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.563
- Guess that's kind of
like how I believe in God.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.666
- You think God's imaginary?

15:33.699 --> 15:35.668
- Maybe, I mean,

15:35.701 --> 15:38.103
at least you can see Caden.

15:38.137 --> 15:40.105
I pray every day to God,

15:40.139 --> 15:42.574
but I never hear him or see him.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.710
- Yeah.

15:46.145 --> 15:50.049
- Derrick, your hand is
like dripping with sweat.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.253
Ew, are those boogers
on your fingers?

15:56.722 --> 15:58.724
- Derrick, cut that out.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.258
- Hello, Iris.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.663
- Marlene?

16:07.733 --> 16:09.335
Derrick?

17:01.653 --> 17:03.188
- Iris!

17:05.624 --> 17:07.726
Derrick!

17:09.361 --> 17:11.430
It's time to go home!

17:24.742 --> 17:26.377
- Caden?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.315
Are you there?

17:34.353 --> 17:37.256
Please don't leave
me here by myself.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.825
Caden!

17:50.569 --> 17:51.537
- Iris!

17:51.570 --> 17:52.570
Iris!

18:00.179 --> 18:01.179
Iris?

18:08.787 --> 18:10.689
- Caden?

18:15.794 --> 18:16.929
Marlene?

18:16.962 --> 18:18.697
- Shh, it's gonna be okay kid.

18:18.730 --> 18:19.898
We're gonna get you home.

18:32.544 --> 18:33.579
- Listen.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.714
Yeah, the barn, I know.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.549
It wasn't a haunted barn,

18:37.583 --> 18:39.785
it apparently just
needed a new roof.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.454
No, they were there,
yes they were there,

18:42.488 --> 18:44.265
the so-called sufferers
of demonic possession.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.426
They suffered concussions
from the fallen roof.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.929
No, Iris, yeah we're on our
way to Black Falls right now,

18:50.963 --> 18:53.699
Iris finally set us
up with an asylum.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.667
Yes, I know...

18:57.870 --> 18:59.438
Apparently there
was this nurse there

18:59.471 --> 19:01.673
that just went crazy and
slaughtered everybody there

19:01.707 --> 19:03.609
and burnt the place down.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.478
It should be good, I know.

19:06.512 --> 19:07.846
Lennie?

19:07.880 --> 19:10.582
You're cutting, Lennie
you're cutting out.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.718
- Okay.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.855
- I'm listening, Lennie, I'm
trying to find reception.

19:16.889 --> 19:17.956
All right.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.867
- What are you
taking pictures of?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.569
- Just the river.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.871
- That's a nice camera,
can I take a look?

19:32.905 --> 19:34.273
- Actually, no.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.708
Excuse me, this is my car.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.911
- You from around here?

19:38.944 --> 19:40.546
- Not anymore.

19:40.579 --> 19:41.480
- What's not anymore mean?

19:41.513 --> 19:43.782
- I used to live a
couple miles from here.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.518
- Not much of anything a
couple miles from here.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.831
- I'm sorry, what did you
say your name was again?

20:00.499 --> 20:01.700
- Elvis.

20:07.806 --> 20:10.242
You crazy bitch.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.511
Just to let you know,

20:12.544 --> 20:14.713
I work at the gas
station down the road.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.748
Come on by if you
ever want a fill up.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.906
- Sorry about that, Lennie
was talking my ear off.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.550
He seems pretty excited that

20:42.574 --> 20:43.942
we're going to
Black Falls though.

20:46.678 --> 20:47.679
You okay?

20:47.713 --> 20:49.514
- Yeah, let's go.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.717
We should check in at the hotel.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.418
- Excited to be going home?

20:53.452 --> 20:55.787
- Excited to be going
into the heart of nowhere?

20:56.588 --> 20:58.557
- I don't like
other people getting

20:58.590 --> 20:59.801
all up in my business, you know?

20:59.825 --> 21:01.326
- Don't worry, from
what I remember,

21:01.360 --> 21:02.995
everyone was really nice.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.997
- Sure, from what you remember.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.838
Definitely a lot of
nothing out here.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.616
- We will get that
shower curtain

21:24.650 --> 21:26.652
replaced for you right away.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.920
- And the air conditioner
is way too loud.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.756
- It's too loud?
- Hey Iris, there's coffee.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.491
- Yes.

21:32.524 --> 21:33.358
- Sir, I would offer

21:33.392 --> 21:35.961
to move you to
another room, however,

21:35.994 --> 21:37.396
all of the air
conditioning units

21:37.429 --> 21:39.431
are the same in
all of the rooms.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.099
- No elevator, great.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.603
You want me to take
your bag for you?

21:44.636 --> 21:45.937
- That's fine.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.706
- All right.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.377
Take a nap, see you
in about an hour?

21:52.411 --> 21:54.112
- Yeah, just knock on my door.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.614
- All right, see you in a bit.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.005
- I'm coming, just a minute.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.689
Fuck.

23:47.859 --> 23:50.195
- Hey, you look like shit.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.606
- Yeah, that's
better than usual.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.132
- Right, you ready to go?

23:54.533 --> 23:56.635
- Yeah, give me a second.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.740
- Look at this, how do you
always get the nice room?

24:05.043 --> 24:06.678
- No no.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.681
- You all right?

24:12.951 --> 24:14.886
You're gonna change now?

24:14.920 --> 24:16.555
Really?

24:18.957 --> 24:21.726
So this Eddie guy,
who is he again.

24:22.594 --> 24:24.596
- She's a girl.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.666
Eddie is short for Edith.

24:27.699 --> 24:29.034
- Yeah, that makes sense.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.670
It's just, the entire
time I've known you,

24:31.703 --> 24:33.705
you've never dressed
up nice once.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.674
- Yeah, well, I will now.

24:35.707 --> 24:37.042
- All right.

24:37.075 --> 24:38.577
Twenty minutes?

24:38.610 --> 24:40.011
- Yeah.

24:47.619 --> 24:48.620
- Hello!

24:48.653 --> 24:50.689
- Eddie, hi, it's me!

24:50.722 --> 24:52.057
- Good to see you, come here!

24:52.090 --> 24:53.225
Hello, welcome.

24:53.258 --> 24:55.627
- This is my coworker Jacob.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.028
- Your coworker?

24:57.062 --> 24:58.697
- Yeah.

24:58.930 --> 25:01.666
- Okay, great, the
more the merrier.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.702
Please, come on in.

25:17.849 --> 25:21.686
So, you're really
making movies now, huh?

25:22.254 --> 25:24.956
- Yeah, you could say that.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.626
- More like television spots.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.779
I don't know if she'll ever
make it to the big screen.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.831
- I'm so proud of you, kid.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.933
- Thanks Eddie, you
always believed in me.

25:34.966 --> 25:36.701
- I always knew
something would come.

25:36.735 --> 25:40.038
You running around with
that camcorder all the time.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.373
How do you like L.A.?

25:41.406 --> 25:45.143
- Mm-mm. It's, um, different.

25:45.176 --> 25:48.747
But it's nice to
be back, you know?

25:48.780 --> 25:51.216
It's louder over
there, that's for sure.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.919
- Not too much isn't
louder than Black Falls.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.721
I'm so glad you called.

25:56.755 --> 25:57.856
It's been too long.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.724
- I know, thanks for picking up.

25:59.758 --> 26:01.660
- Yeah, thank you for coming.

26:01.693 --> 26:05.030
I mean, you know, things
get kinda crazy at school.

26:05.330 --> 26:06.998
Kids these days, right?

26:13.038 --> 26:14.673
He's just hungry.

26:17.876 --> 26:20.178
Okay, well, very good.

26:20.211 --> 26:21.980
Come with me.

26:22.013 --> 26:23.348
I'll show you the kitchen.

26:23.381 --> 26:25.417
I've gotta check on the soup.

26:25.450 --> 26:28.320
- Okay.
- I'm gonna take this.

26:28.353 --> 26:32.724
- Let me just get some food
in him and then we can eat.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.992
- Okay.

26:34.025 --> 26:36.094
- Do you want to say hello?

26:36.127 --> 26:37.696
He's pretty harmless.

26:37.729 --> 26:38.830
- Yeah, sure.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.001
- Yeah, so I would say this
is probably my favorite room.

26:43.034 --> 26:44.936
I spend a lot of time in here.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.237
- I can tell.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.672
- I know, I'm a mess.

26:47.706 --> 26:48.974
Here, follow me.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.109
The best time of
the year is summer,

26:51.142 --> 26:53.445
because, obviously,
I don't have to work,

26:53.478 --> 26:55.313
so I get to spend
a lot of time here,

26:55.347 --> 26:58.750
and kind of cozy in I guess.

27:00.218 --> 27:03.722
- It must be hard, taking
care of him by yourself.

27:03.755 --> 27:07.092
- Yeah, when mom passed,

27:07.125 --> 27:09.327
I said I would look
after him but...

27:10.328 --> 27:12.464
I'm starting to wonder if
there's an expiration date

27:12.497 --> 27:15.300
on promises like that, you know?

27:15.500 --> 27:20.739
Okay, over here, this
is the last room.

27:20.772 --> 27:24.009
Probably looks
pretty much the same,

27:24.042 --> 27:25.419
we haven't really
changed it much yet.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.846
But I'm actually planning
a big renovation here,

27:27.879 --> 27:29.381
maybe make it into an office,

27:29.414 --> 27:31.082
because the light is so nice,

27:31.116 --> 27:33.918
and there's this space
over here, which is just...

27:38.523 --> 27:40.291
Hey buddy.

27:40.925 --> 27:42.460
You ready for dinner?

27:45.497 --> 27:46.931
Open up.

27:49.868 --> 27:51.136
Open up.

27:53.872 --> 27:56.241
Brought some friends,
you wanna say hello?

27:57.008 --> 27:59.477
- Hey Derrick, remember me?

28:00.979 --> 28:04.049
- He seems to just
keep getting worse.

28:04.482 --> 28:07.485
At first, he...

28:08.219 --> 28:10.822
After the accident, he
seemed like he was okay.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.925
Like he was still there,

28:14.292 --> 28:16.461
he just didn't want
to talk about it.

28:16.494 --> 28:19.497
But he just keeps, regressing.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.934
And now he seems to have
the mind of a five-year-old.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.504
- I had no idea it
had gotten this bad.

28:27.505 --> 28:30.275
I should've been better
at staying in contact.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.388
- Don't take it
personally he just

28:34.412 --> 28:36.381
doesn't like it when
people touch him.

28:37.115 --> 28:38.917
- Does he talk to you?

28:38.950 --> 28:40.318
- Sometimes.

28:40.351 --> 28:43.488
I know he's still thinking,
there's still something.

28:43.521 --> 28:45.223
In there.

28:46.524 --> 28:48.493
He just started
that one yesterday,

28:48.526 --> 28:51.896
and now he's filled
almost the whole thing.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.406
He's having a seizure, help me.

29:01.439 --> 29:03.908
Help me, help me
get him to the bed.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.310
- Should I call 911?

29:05.343 --> 29:06.411
- No.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.289
Only if it lasts longer
than a couple of minutes,

29:08.313 --> 29:10.115
we just need to
get him to the bed,

29:10.148 --> 29:12.117
and get him on his side.

29:15.987 --> 29:19.491
Okay, okay, shh
Derrick, it's okay.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.930
Okay.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.368
Seems like he's stopped shaking.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.337
I think he's gonna be okay.

29:32.370 --> 29:33.404
- Thank God.

29:42.013 --> 29:45.250
- Okay, why don't we go
hang out in the living room?

29:55.593 --> 29:58.329
- So, has Eddie changed much?

29:58.363 --> 30:01.099
She seemed happy to see you.

30:06.437 --> 30:09.340
And Derrick, that was strange.

30:11.509 --> 30:13.845
Do you mind if I ask
what happened to him?

31:08.333 --> 31:10.635
- No, this isn't real.

31:24.082 --> 31:26.384
No, no.

31:26.417 --> 31:29.220
Why won't you leave me alone?

31:33.458 --> 31:34.492
Get out.

32:05.723 --> 32:08.293
- So how far of a drive is it?

32:08.326 --> 32:09.627
- 20, 25 minutes.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.129
- That's not bad.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.373
Think we'll get some good stuff?

32:12.397 --> 32:13.507
- Yeah, Lennie's definitely not

32:13.531 --> 32:15.533
gonna be disappointed
that's for sure.

32:15.566 --> 32:17.168
- Well, I hope so
when's the last time

32:17.201 --> 32:18.403
we got something good?

32:18.436 --> 32:19.437
- Now.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.473
- Try telling him that.

32:24.375 --> 32:28.046
Yeah, haunted barn,
midnight moaning.

32:28.813 --> 32:30.615
A dairy farm with
cows who happen

32:30.648 --> 32:32.684
to be awake at night,
that's all it was.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.118
- That's why we're
in Black Falls

32:34.152 --> 32:36.354
and I'm taking us to
this asylum, okay?

32:36.387 --> 32:37.622
- Mm-hm.

32:37.655 --> 32:40.091
I'm not doubting
you, it's just I,

32:40.124 --> 32:41.492
I want this to be good.

32:41.526 --> 32:44.329
What do you remember as a kid?

32:44.696 --> 32:46.297
It had to be
frightening enough then

32:46.331 --> 32:49.400
for you to want to come
back and do a show there.

32:53.404 --> 32:55.440
- We'll be there soon, okay?

32:55.773 --> 32:57.208
- Okay.

33:00.278 --> 33:02.380
We're on our way to the asylum.

33:02.413 --> 33:04.382
Da-da-da-da-dum.

33:05.616 --> 33:08.353
- I don't feel like
singing anymore, Jacob.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.728
- You should've told me
to bring better shoes,

33:16.761 --> 33:19.130
I have dirt in them all ready.

33:19.163 --> 33:22.433
- If I can do this when I'm
a kid, you can do this now.

33:40.351 --> 33:43.221
- How long you planning on
poking around down here?

33:43.254 --> 33:44.389
- Just today and tomorrow.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.090
We're on a deadline
to put together

33:46.124 --> 33:47.392
an episode for next week.

33:47.425 --> 33:50.428
- I'd tell you to reconsider
but no one wants to

33:50.461 --> 33:53.297
listen to what I have
to say about the asylum.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.235
Seems to me, there's
something down there

33:57.268 --> 33:59.270
that just shouldn't
be messed around with.

33:59.303 --> 34:01.339
- You mean the
nurse, sister Agnes?

34:01.372 --> 34:03.408
- Nurses are
supposed to heal you,

34:03.441 --> 34:06.144
she just made her
patients worse.

34:06.177 --> 34:08.379
She liked to watch them suffer.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.420
- See, this is why
I hate small towns.

34:20.658 --> 34:23.795
Yeah, tetanus shot and one
of those hospital masks.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.330
Can barely breathe down here.

34:34.472 --> 34:38.275
Oh man, the hell
went on down here?

34:38.876 --> 34:41.712
- Let's get some footage
of this hallway first.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.449
There should be a small
church down this way.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.552
- What, you mean like a chapel?

34:48.286 --> 34:50.487
- Yeah, a chapel.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.228
- Does it say
anything about crazy

34:57.261 --> 34:59.797
cave paintings of
eyes in the bible?

35:00.898 --> 35:02.266
- I wonder if anyone here was

35:02.300 --> 35:04.402
actually cured of
their insanity,

35:04.702 --> 35:07.605
or if this place just
made them crazier.

35:07.905 --> 35:10.308
- You know, not
everybody was insane.

35:10.341 --> 35:13.377
People were locked up for
all sorts of shitty reasons,

35:13.411 --> 35:15.713
being gay, slutty,
it was all a crime.

35:15.980 --> 35:18.449
Glad I wasn't alive back then.

35:20.751 --> 35:23.821
- If I remember correctly
from when I was a kid,

35:24.889 --> 35:28.159
there was a door... here.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.638
- Did you hear that?

35:49.914 --> 35:51.816
Oh man.

35:53.351 --> 35:54.485
Whoever was locked in here

35:54.519 --> 35:56.888
definitely did not
want to be here.

35:57.421 --> 35:59.290
The hell is that?

36:01.492 --> 36:02.827
What does this stuff even say?

36:02.860 --> 36:04.462
It's not even legible.

36:05.396 --> 36:06.640
I don't even think
they're words.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.499
I mean, half the
wall is torn up.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.907
What I wanna know is where
he got all the paint.

36:15.940 --> 36:18.609
I don't even know
if that is paint.

36:36.394 --> 36:38.362
Iris, you see this?

36:40.464 --> 36:42.366
What is that?

36:48.739 --> 36:50.541
This is what we need.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.980
- Wait, don't, don't.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.482
- But this is what
we're looking...

36:58.516 --> 37:00.351
- No, let's keep going.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.811
This all feels so familiar.

37:28.546 --> 37:29.981
- Say something to the camera.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.482
Come on, for Lenny.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.418
Fine.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.355
Look at this.

37:37.822 --> 37:39.757
See, this is why I
don't go to the doctor

37:39.790 --> 37:41.425
when I need to.

37:43.461 --> 37:44.428
Are you okay?

37:44.462 --> 37:46.397
- I'm fine.
I just need some water.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.999
- Are you sure?

37:49.634 --> 37:51.469
Take it easy, all right?

37:51.502 --> 37:53.437
You'll be fine.

38:01.078 --> 38:01.912
- Sorry.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.447
- What the hell?

38:06.684 --> 38:08.719
- Be a bit more
careful, all right?

38:08.753 --> 38:09.453
- Thanks.

38:09.487 --> 38:10.388
- Yeah.

38:10.421 --> 38:12.523
What kind of stuff went on here?

38:25.503 --> 38:27.672
- I can't believe
this is still here.

38:27.705 --> 38:29.140
- What's that?

38:29.173 --> 38:31.375
- It's an ice pick.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.377
You know, for ice
pick lobotomies?

38:33.411 --> 38:35.046
- Mm-hm.

38:35.079 --> 38:38.115
- You just slide it through
the top of the eye socket

38:38.149 --> 38:42.653
and tap it in a couple of times.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.458
To break through the skull
right into the brain.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.560
- Right.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.164
- Where are you going?

38:53.197 --> 38:57.601
- Just, uh, we should
get more footage, right?

39:09.213 --> 39:11.515
Five second rule, r right?

39:13.517 --> 39:14.518
Iris?

39:16.687 --> 39:18.689
Where are you off to?

39:20.124 --> 39:21.492
Iris?

39:31.502 --> 39:32.703
Iris?

39:34.805 --> 39:35.973
Marco?

39:47.818 --> 39:49.787
Did you see this tub?

39:50.621 --> 39:51.722
Iris?

39:52.990 --> 39:54.458
Iris?

39:54.892 --> 39:57.094
If you don't come out
for dinner I will eat

39:57.128 --> 39:58.229
all of the food.

39:58.262 --> 40:00.598
You will be left
here with dust, dirt

40:00.631 --> 40:02.209
and whatever the hell
is on the floor here.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.101
I don't even know what that is.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.669
Iris?

40:10.040 --> 40:12.877
Come on, pick up.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.479
I've got reception somewhere.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.488
- Jacob?

40:24.522 --> 40:27.925
- Hey Iris, there you are.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.962
- Are you okay?

40:31.996 --> 40:34.765
- W-W-Where have you been?

40:34.799 --> 40:37.067
- I thought you were behind me.
Are you okay?

40:39.136 --> 40:42.072
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

40:42.106 --> 40:46.143
I just, this place it's
making me sick, all right.

40:46.177 --> 40:49.079
There's the dust, the
mold, the blaring.

40:49.113 --> 40:52.216
I, where the hell did you go?

40:52.249 --> 40:55.820
You just, y-you just
walked off without me?

40:55.853 --> 40:58.088
- Like I said, I thought
you were following me.

40:58.122 --> 41:01.692
But when I turned
around you were gone.

41:11.836 --> 41:13.313
- I should have brought
a thicker sweater.

41:13.337 --> 41:15.906
I didn't realize how cold
it was gonna be down there.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.246
I, I don't think I'm
gonna make it to Marlene's

41:22.279 --> 41:24.148
for dinner.

41:24.181 --> 41:25.749
- It's fine, rest up.

41:25.783 --> 41:27.318
I'll just check on
you after dinner.

41:27.351 --> 41:29.086
- Okay thanks.

41:29.286 --> 41:33.224
If I, if I don't answer
I'm probably sleeping.

42:05.890 --> 42:09.360
- Must be exciting for you
living in the big city.

42:09.393 --> 42:12.196
- I miss Black Falls sometimes.

42:12.229 --> 42:14.965
It's nice to be
surrounded by nature.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.176
- Well you should go
for a hike as long

42:16.200 --> 42:17.167
as you're here.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.336
- Maybe, if I have time I will.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.839
We're on a tight shoot
schedule but I do

42:21.872 --> 42:24.174
want to visit a few
places from my childhood.

42:24.775 --> 42:25.843
- Fuck you.

42:25.876 --> 42:28.312
- Marlene we have company.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.315
Shall we say grace?

42:32.716 --> 42:36.220
Lord, thank you for
this great bounty.

42:36.253 --> 42:38.255
Bless us as we are
but your children

42:38.289 --> 42:40.958
in need of guidance.

42:40.991 --> 42:42.402
Bless our dear guest
Iris who has come

42:42.426 --> 42:44.361
a long way to our humble home.

42:44.395 --> 42:48.399
We are truly thankful
for her presence.

42:48.432 --> 42:51.368
Make us grateful for
all of your mercies.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.171
In Jesus' name we pray.

42:56.907 --> 43:00.044
- Thank you, this
looks delicious.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.112
- Oh, you're very welcome.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.381
It's not often that
we have visitors.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.217
- It's not often that I
get a home cooked meal.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.251
- Fuck you Iris.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.689
- You will be
grateful young lady.

43:11.722 --> 43:14.658
Or you will be sent
straight back to your room.

43:14.692 --> 43:17.261
- I'm sorry mother.

43:19.296 --> 43:20.931
- Salt?

43:20.965 --> 43:22.866
- No thank you.

43:22.900 --> 43:25.102
But these vegetables are great.

43:26.136 --> 43:27.771
- I'm glad you like them.

43:27.805 --> 43:32.042
I use only fresh vegetables
that I grow in my garden.

43:32.076 --> 43:34.044
Not something you can
get every day I imagine,

43:34.078 --> 43:35.412
where you live.

43:36.213 --> 43:38.916
- How is life in the big city?

43:38.949 --> 43:40.050
- It's fine.

43:40.084 --> 43:42.152
- You don't miss Black Falls?

43:42.186 --> 43:44.221
- Sometimes I do.

43:45.389 --> 43:48.058
- Remember when we
were kids and we used

43:48.092 --> 43:50.127
to play freeze tag?

43:50.160 --> 43:52.096
And make believe?

43:52.129 --> 43:54.298
- Yeah, I remember.

43:54.331 --> 43:56.700
- That was a lot
of fun wasn't it?

43:57.468 --> 43:59.036
- Yeah.

44:00.270 --> 44:04.141
- Yesterday below the
stairs I saw a girl

44:04.174 --> 44:06.076
who wasn't there.

44:06.110 --> 44:08.345
She wasn't there again today.

44:08.379 --> 44:10.381
I wish she'd fucking go away.

44:10.414 --> 44:12.182
- I made pie for dessert.

44:12.216 --> 44:14.385
Something for us
to look forward to.

44:14.418 --> 44:16.954
Perhaps with some ice cream.

44:21.158 --> 44:24.094
I'll be just downstairs
if you need anything.

44:24.128 --> 44:25.128
- Thank you Jean.

44:32.002 --> 44:34.204
- You stopped seeing Caden.

44:34.238 --> 44:37.041
- Yeah, on meds for that now.

44:37.074 --> 44:38.375
- It's too bad.

44:38.409 --> 44:40.477
He may have been imaginary but

44:40.511 --> 44:42.913
he was good for you.

44:42.946 --> 44:45.215
- Imaginary friends
are for kids.

44:45.249 --> 44:47.284
I needed to grow up eventually.

44:47.317 --> 44:49.186
- Growing up's overrated.

44:49.219 --> 44:50.954
- Apparently.

44:53.323 --> 44:56.360
- So you want to know
how I ended up like this?

44:56.393 --> 44:58.896
I know you're curious.

44:58.929 --> 45:00.898
Untie me and I'll tell you.

45:01.131 --> 45:02.366
- That's okay.

45:02.399 --> 45:04.101
You don't have to tell me.

45:04.134 --> 45:06.103
- But we never used
to keep secrets

45:06.136 --> 45:07.137
did we?

45:07.171 --> 45:08.172
- You don't have to.

45:08.205 --> 45:09.373
- I want to.

45:11.275 --> 45:14.078
Come on Iris, please, let me go.

45:14.111 --> 45:15.946
My wrist is starting to hurt.

45:15.979 --> 45:18.248
- Would your mom
be okay with that?

45:18.282 --> 45:20.417
- Fuck that bitch.

45:21.518 --> 45:23.854
Come on Iris, please?

45:25.189 --> 45:27.057
It's not fair that
you get to sit there

45:27.091 --> 45:28.892
while I'm tied up.

45:29.993 --> 45:33.197
It's not like I'm
gonna hurt you.

45:34.131 --> 45:35.933
Please?

45:36.133 --> 45:37.401
Please, please?

45:37.434 --> 45:38.202
- Okay.

45:38.235 --> 45:39.203
- Please.

45:39.236 --> 45:40.270
- Okay.

45:41.238 --> 45:43.040
- Thank you Iris.

45:44.575 --> 45:47.211
- That's what friends are for.

45:47.244 --> 45:49.079
- I used to have the
most beautiful eyes,

45:49.113 --> 45:50.581
didn't i?

45:50.614 --> 45:54.151
My mom used to tell me how
jealous she was of them.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.890
Two windows into a field
of dreams she'd say.

45:59.923 --> 46:03.193
But after you took us down there

46:03.227 --> 46:08.198
down that hell hole
I started seeing

46:08.232 --> 46:10.300
the most horrible things.

46:23.013 --> 46:25.449
Maggot are you.

46:30.120 --> 46:33.991
You know, I just
want to help you.

46:34.024 --> 46:37.294
Want you to be free.

46:38.162 --> 46:42.366
But you just disobey me.

46:46.904 --> 46:51.909
Father who art in
Heaven forgive those

46:52.442 --> 46:56.180
who sin.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.918
- Look at me!

47:00.951 --> 47:03.387
- Oh, do you see God?

47:18.368 --> 47:23.373
And if thine eye
offends the and it does,

47:26.076 --> 47:28.979
then I must pluck it out.

47:29.012 --> 47:30.180
You understand?

47:30.214 --> 47:34.218
You brought this
upon yourself sinner.

47:34.251 --> 47:38.088
Now you, you pay for thy debts.

47:38.121 --> 47:41.491
- No. No!
- And you shall come to light.

48:07.351 --> 48:09.219
- You know what I've
noticed about this

48:09.253 --> 48:11.521
world we live in?

48:12.556 --> 48:15.225
I don't feel pain anymore.

48:22.199 --> 48:24.668
Do you still feel pain?

48:27.204 --> 48:29.239
I can hear you.

48:29.273 --> 48:31.108
I know where you are.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.656
- Marlene.

48:50.761 --> 48:53.397
- Would you just wake up Iris?

48:54.765 --> 48:57.968
First Derrick, now you?

48:58.669 --> 49:01.538
I can't do this anymore.

49:01.571 --> 49:04.675
Am I the only one who
wants to get out of here?

50:06.269 --> 50:07.771
- Owe.

50:29.226 --> 50:30.627
- The number you are calling

50:30.660 --> 50:32.229
is no longer in use.

50:32.262 --> 50:34.164
Please try your call again.

50:39.469 --> 50:41.471
- Hey, how are you feeling?

50:41.505 --> 50:42.706
- Horrible.

50:42.739 --> 50:44.808
- Oh, okay I guess
I'll give Lenny a call

50:44.841 --> 50:46.843
and ask for an extension.

50:48.245 --> 50:49.355
Do you want to just
take a day to get

50:49.379 --> 50:50.614
over your cold?

50:50.647 --> 50:52.315
- Yeah.

50:52.349 --> 50:53.517
- Do you need anything?

50:53.550 --> 50:54.484
I can stop by the
pharmacy if you

50:54.518 --> 50:56.653
want something over the counter?

51:09.199 --> 51:11.268
- Jacob, Jacob.

52:14.331 --> 52:15.298
- The number you are calling

52:15.332 --> 52:16.633
is no longer in use.

52:16.666 --> 52:18.702
Please try your call again.

52:24.908 --> 52:25.918
- The number you are calling

52:25.942 --> 52:27.277
is no longer in use.

52:27.310 --> 52:29.279
Please try your call again.

52:32.015 --> 52:34.251
- Jacob, I'm having
trouble reaching Lenny.

52:34.284 --> 52:36.520
Do you know what's going on?

52:36.553 --> 52:38.722
I'm gonna head out,
grab some food.

52:38.755 --> 52:39.890
I'll text you okay?

52:41.558 --> 52:43.927
Oh I'm sorry I must
have the wrong room.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.396
- That's okay, I'm sure
it's an honest mistake.

52:46.429 --> 52:47.264
- Right.

52:47.297 --> 52:48.665
It's just...

52:49.366 --> 52:50.934
- Miss, are you okay?

52:50.967 --> 52:53.703
- No, my friend Jacob
was staying in this room.

52:53.737 --> 52:55.438
I'm positive of it.

52:55.472 --> 52:56.806
- I checked in two days ago.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.342
Are you sure you
have the right room?

52:59.376 --> 53:00.877
- Excuse me.

53:08.385 --> 53:09.486
- Can I help you?

53:09.519 --> 53:11.254
- Yes, I checked in two days ago

53:11.288 --> 53:12.756
with my coworker Jacob.

53:12.789 --> 53:13.866
He should be in the
room across from mine

53:13.890 --> 53:15.892
but he's not there anymore.

53:16.993 --> 53:18.895
- Jacob.

53:19.329 --> 53:20.430
That's strange.

53:20.463 --> 53:22.999
Um, what is his last name?

53:23.033 --> 53:27.003
- I, uh, his last name is, um...

53:31.474 --> 53:34.611
- Do you remember what
room number he was in?

53:34.644 --> 53:37.347
- No I can't remember.

53:38.448 --> 53:39.716
You know what, forget about it.

53:39.749 --> 53:40.927
I probably just made a mistake.

53:40.951 --> 53:43.253
I'll go check
again on my friend.

54:11.982 --> 54:13.350
- Hello?

54:13.383 --> 54:16.019
- Hello, did
you ask about room 204?

54:16.052 --> 54:17.954
- No I don't think so.

54:17.988 --> 54:19.465
- It says here that
you're currently staying

54:19.489 --> 54:20.991
in room 204.

54:21.725 --> 54:23.393
- No i'm not, I'm in room...

54:23.426 --> 54:24.728
- You're very welcome.

54:24.761 --> 54:26.863
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

54:26.896 --> 54:30.066
- No, I mean yes,
could you please...

54:30.100 --> 54:32.936
- You're going to burn in hell.

55:19.949 --> 55:23.853
- Iris, well come in, come in.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.757
What's wrong?

55:30.860 --> 55:32.595
Shh, it's okay.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.671
I brought you a clean towel.

55:41.705 --> 55:43.506
There's more in
the hallway closet.

55:43.540 --> 55:44.741
- Thanks Eddie.

55:44.774 --> 55:45.875
For everything.

55:45.909 --> 55:47.844
- No problem kid.

55:47.877 --> 55:52.515
So um, what's the plan?

55:53.583 --> 55:55.985
- Plan is to finish filming.

55:56.019 --> 55:58.755
I'm going back down to
the asylum tomorrow.

56:00.890 --> 56:03.893
- Why is it so important for you

56:03.927 --> 56:05.895
to finish filming
in that asylum?

56:05.929 --> 56:08.565
- I have to find out
what's down there.

56:08.598 --> 56:11.701
I saw her, when I was a kid.

56:11.735 --> 56:13.069
The nurse.

56:14.037 --> 56:16.706
- Sister Agnes is
a stupid urban myth

56:16.740 --> 56:18.842
that teenagers
keep perpetuating.

56:18.875 --> 56:20.810
- I have to know who she is.

56:20.844 --> 56:22.212
What she is.

56:22.245 --> 56:24.514
- I don't understand why
this is so important to you.

56:24.547 --> 56:26.092
I mean you don't
actually believe that...

56:26.116 --> 56:27.951
- I saw her.

56:28.918 --> 56:31.020
- Okay.

56:32.622 --> 56:33.999
I'm just trying to
look out for you.

56:34.023 --> 56:35.992
- I'll be fine Eddie.

56:36.025 --> 56:38.128
I just need some answers.

56:40.897 --> 56:42.041
- I should never have
let you kids go down

56:42.065 --> 56:44.033
there in the first place.

56:44.567 --> 56:45.902
I mean this is all my fault.

56:45.935 --> 56:50.740
If I had just stopped
Derrick than none of this

56:50.774 --> 56:52.809
ever would have happened.

56:52.842 --> 56:55.011
- No, it's my fault.

56:55.044 --> 56:56.613
I'm the one that
wanted to shoot that

56:56.646 --> 56:58.848
stupid horror movie
in the first place.

58:03.112 --> 58:04.948
- Hey.

58:05.348 --> 58:06.683
I made some dinner.

58:06.716 --> 58:07.951
Are you hungry?

58:07.984 --> 58:10.720
- Yeah thanks, I'll
be out in a minute.

58:18.995 --> 58:23.600
- Lobotomies, blood
letting and ice baths.

58:23.633 --> 58:25.668
Sounds like torture to me.

58:25.702 --> 58:27.704
- Yeah it is.

58:29.839 --> 58:32.876
- Agnes Dorschner.

58:33.109 --> 58:34.844
Orphan.

58:34.878 --> 58:38.114
Raised by nuns in the
Black Falls Sanctuary.

58:39.949 --> 58:41.985
Became a nurse when
the church refused to

58:42.018 --> 58:43.319
let her take her vows.

58:43.353 --> 58:44.954
Can the church do that?

58:44.988 --> 58:48.057
- No idea, but I'm sure they
had good reason for that.

58:49.759 --> 58:51.327
It's weird.

58:51.361 --> 58:52.996
- What's weird?

58:53.029 --> 58:54.697
- I've been able to
piece together some

58:54.731 --> 58:57.800
information about this
nurse Agnes Dorschner

58:57.834 --> 59:00.637
but only until the year 1942.

59:00.970 --> 59:02.739
She probably died
around that same time

59:02.772 --> 59:05.308
but there's no record
of an obituary.

59:05.975 --> 59:07.610
Jacob has more
research on his laptop

59:07.644 --> 59:10.046
but I can't seem to
find the password.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.315
- Who?

59:12.882 --> 59:13.983
- My coworker Jacob.

59:14.017 --> 59:16.619
You met him the last
time I was here.

59:21.991 --> 59:24.761
- You came here
by yourself Iris.

59:24.794 --> 59:26.062
- No, I came with someone else.

59:26.095 --> 59:27.964
You told me you saw him.

59:27.997 --> 59:29.832
- I can't keep
pretending for you.

59:29.866 --> 59:31.100
- You're lying.

59:31.134 --> 59:33.836
- I am just trying to
point out the obvious.

59:33.870 --> 59:35.838
- Ask Derrick, he saw Jacob.

59:35.872 --> 59:37.674
Derrick was in the
same room as us.

59:37.707 --> 59:39.342
- Ask Derrick?

59:42.845 --> 59:44.647
- I'm sorry.

59:44.681 --> 59:47.116
I didn't mean it like that.

59:47.984 --> 59:49.986
- I'm gonna be out there.

59:50.753 --> 59:54.791
If you want dinner come on out.

59:56.893 --> 59:58.194
- Eddie.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.182
- Sweet dreams kiddo.

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:53.409
- Hey, Derrick?

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:24.006
Derrick, can you hear me?

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:26.943
- Yes.

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.378
- Derrick.

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:33.082
- Some demons never die.

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:18.227
- You're going to burn in hell.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:31.974
- Eddie, Eddie get
me out of here.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.142
Eddie!

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.846
Eddie.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.055
Derrick?

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.090
Where's Eddie?

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:51.060
- Hungry?

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:52.962
- No.

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.630
- I'm not sure where she is.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:55.631
- She was just here.

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:57.900
I just saw her.

01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:00.436
When did you start
speaking again?

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:04.407
- Please don't scream.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.476
I don't like it when
people scream at me.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.179
- I mean this is the
first time I've heard

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:11.647
you talking in a while.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.616
- I talk all the time.

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:16.619
Maybe you should listen.

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:20.022
If you listen more you
might learn something.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.666
- I'm not hungry.

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:12.387
- Iris where are you going?

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.077
- Shh.

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:17.413
What...

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.615
No, no, no.

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.053
No.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.721
- Look at me, look at me.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.557
There's, there's nobody there.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:29.992
Shh.

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:47.009
Shh.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.079
I believe you.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.380
I believe you.

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:52.448
I believe you.

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:53.649
Shh.

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.367
- May I help you Miss?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.668
- I was just here this morning.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.370
I think I left
something in my room.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:15.747
- Okay, if you left
something in the room

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:18.207
the maid probably turned
it into lost and found.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.742
- I just need to see something.

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.610
It will only take a minute.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:22.788
- But you already checked out.

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.280
- Then I'll check in.

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.648
- Okay.
- Can you do that for me?

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:26.782
- Yes.
Yes I can.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:27.816
- Thank you.

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:05.521
Are you scared?

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.525
Should I be?

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.597
Are you gonna be okay?

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:28.210
Iris am I going crazy?

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.500
Jacob?

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:37.872
- Guys hurry!

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:42.877
- I'm stuck.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:43.645
- What are you doing?

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:44.680
Give me your arm.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:45.680
- Take it.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.383
Caden!

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:22.518
- Iris.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.420
- You shouldn't be here.

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.388
- I have to stop her.

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:28.457
- You can't.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.726
- I can't live my life
like this anymore.

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.428
- You can't stay here.

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:33.762
You have to go back.

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:35.631
- I can't just go.

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.800
You have to help me.

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:42.338
Please, just tell me what
I'm dealing with here.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:45.608
Is she ghost, a demon?

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:47.676
I can do this.

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:55.484
Sister Agnes is a real person.

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.019
There are photos
of her and she is

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.521
on the staff roster
at Black Falls.

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:02.992
But did she really
kill her patients?

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:05.694
I mean this was an asylum right?

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:09.732
Patients died all the time
from unnatural causes.

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:12.768
She was never really
accused of murder.

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.538
- Iris she's here.

01:11:16.572 --> 01:11:17.740
You have to go.

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:18.841
- No, not yet.

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.409
Not until I get answers.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.111
I need to know what happened.

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:23.612
- Iris please.

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.014
- It's not time yet.

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:27.549
- Just get a grip
and get out of here.

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:30.519
Once she gets you it's over.

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.621
There's nothing left to see.

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.056
You never used to
believe that crap

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:36.025
my mom preached, right?

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:40.362
Once you die you
just stop existing.

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:42.865
There's nothing left.

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:46.135
- Iris please, she
may not say much

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.703
but she's always listening.

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:48.971
You have to get out of here.

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:50.115
All she wants to do is hurt...

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.440
- Derrick!

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:52.908
- He's mine now bitch.

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:54.643
- Oh my God, Derrick.

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:55.811
We have to get out of here.

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:57.079
Derrick!

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.857
- You're me.

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:11.360
You're so young.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:18.600
Don't worry it will
all be over soon.

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:20.669
Just close your eyes.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.577
If you see my mom
tell her I'm sorry.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.880
I can't stand living
with her anymore.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:33.182
- Marlene.

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:37.186
My eye!

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.062
- Marlene!

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.898
I don't want to say
goodbye Marlene.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.901
I'm sorry.

01:12:58.707 --> 01:12:59.942
- Help!

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.538
- Hurry!

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.545
I'm stuck.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.753
Caden.

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:48.590
Caden.

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.971
Caden?

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:27.256
- A part of me wants
to believe Iris.

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:33.128
To accept it all as the truth

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:36.598
rather than the ramblings
of a fractured mind.

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:41.236
I like to image that she
made the right choice

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:45.641
and that she's in a
happier place with

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.342
the rest of them.

01:15:50.412 --> 01:15:52.381
That they all made
it out eventually

01:15:52.414 --> 01:15:56.952
and are running around
somewhere in this

01:15:56.985 --> 01:16:01.990
mess of grass and
trees and fresh air.
