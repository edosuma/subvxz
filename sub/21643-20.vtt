00:16.649 --> 00:19.285
Nobody say a word.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.722
-Ruth, I really--
-Shut the fuck up.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.176
Is everybody okay?

01:16.409 --> 01:17.277
-Yeah.
-All good.

01:17.343 --> 01:18.311
Jenny, you good?

01:18.845 --> 01:19.813
Yeah, I'm good.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.681
I'm not good.

01:24.617 --> 01:27.487
I feel like I should be
whispering in front of the scary men,

01:27.554 --> 01:29.122
but I don't think I am.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.726
I think that fourth shit-ball
really messed you up.

01:33.793 --> 01:36.296
Oh, really?
Because I had three more after that.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.269
I can't go to jail.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.206
I'm like catnip for lesbian prisoners.

01:48.875 --> 01:52.579
Look-- Look at this ass.
They will eat it alive.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.350
Maria, you're not going to jail.
It's a shakedown.

01:57.550 --> 02:01.821
They get some bullshit pretext to come in
and take the weed and the money, okay?

02:03.356 --> 02:04.824
But they're not getting the money,

02:05.291 --> 02:07.794
because you figured out
a brilliant way to hide our cash.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.430
Which I was going to implement tomorrow.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.834
Fuck a duck.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.438
Oh, God.

02:18.705 --> 02:22.809
Me tick-tick's boomeranging like a bogan's
joggles on the first day of Commonade.

02:25.245 --> 02:28.781
Pete, I don't know what you're saying,
but I think you're having a panic attack.

02:28.848 --> 02:31.551
The DEA raided my compound when I was 7.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.920
Just a young joey in the pouch of life.

02:38.191 --> 02:40.426
Listen, man,
I've lived through worse than this.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.361
Stay with me.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.263
Thanks, mate.

02:43.596 --> 02:44.931
You're a real Bloomin' Onion.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.468
How can they do this? Weed's legal.

02:48.535 --> 02:50.837
State legal, federally illegal.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.407
So, we exist in a gray zone
where they can still fuck us.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.211
And if you've ever been fucked in
your gray zone, you know it's no picnic.

03:01.447 --> 03:04.651
You're inappropriate
at the most inappropriate times.

03:05.885 --> 03:06.953
I know how this works.

03:07.220 --> 03:07.954
Any second now,

03:08.221 --> 03:12.458
the head agent, who I assure you
will be some roided-up meathead...

03:12.926 --> 03:15.361
is gonna charge through that door
barking orders.

03:15.428 --> 03:17.697
Pardon me, excuse me.
I'm sorry, pardon me.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.499
I have to get through. Thank you.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.335
Hey!

03:24.904 --> 03:27.974
You must be Ruth Whitefeather Feldman.

03:28.608 --> 03:29.509
What a name!

03:29.976 --> 03:32.645
I'm Special Agent Barry Schwartz.

03:33.580 --> 03:37.317
I like to say,
the government made me an agent,

03:37.383 --> 03:40.420
but my mother made me special.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.491
-Are you a Muppet?
-Shhh!

04:01.441 --> 04:02.875
What a beautiful day.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.912
Oh, best roof camping ever.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.349
Hell, yeah, I slept like a stoned baby.

04:09.983 --> 04:14.254
It's so pretty up here.
Way better than that shithole Yosemite.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.555
Fuck Yosemite, baby.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.589
Oh, hey, come look at the view.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.392
I can see all the way to the Ken-Taco-Hut.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.628
Oh, man.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.264
Oh, damn, look at all those cops
buying weed today.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.266
Dank...

04:26.666 --> 04:27.800
those are feds.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.402
Oh, shit.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.005
Look at all those feds
buying weed today.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.275
No, no, no! Ruth is getting raided.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.310
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

04:37.377 --> 04:40.046
What if they find us?
They're gonna kill the black guy first.

04:40.313 --> 04:41.948
Hey, don't worry about it, baby.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.984
They got Travis and Carter to choose from.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.052
Oh!

04:47.353 --> 04:49.022
So, I guess we're just stuck up here?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.391
Like those assholes on the space station.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.062
No, no, no, cool it, okay? Calm down.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.798
We'll just-- We'll just hang out here.

04:58.865 --> 04:59.866
-You know?
-Right.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.067
We'll get high.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.570
Maybe we'll bone a couple of times,
and call it a day.

05:04.671 --> 05:08.308
Oh. So, it's like a regular day,
but outside.

05:09.776 --> 05:10.810
Oh, shit.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.912
My lighter's not working. Can I use yours?

05:12.979 --> 05:14.781
Yeah, no doubt. I got it right here.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.449
Oh, oh, I left it at home.

05:28.961 --> 05:31.698
How you guys doing?
Are those tight? They look tight.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.434
You know,
I was reading somewhere that the wrist

05:34.500 --> 05:37.103
is the most delicate joint in the body.
Isn't that weird?

05:37.370 --> 05:38.571
I'd have guessed knee.

05:38.638 --> 05:39.639
Well...

05:39.706 --> 05:41.507
Fellas, could we cut them loose?

05:41.808 --> 05:42.675
You see?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.444
We're reasonable people.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.547
-Excuse me, sir? May I approach the bench?
-Okay.

05:49.816 --> 05:50.883
I'm Maria Sherman.

05:50.950 --> 05:54.921
I'm just a customer with a family and
a sterling reputation in the community.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.123
And I'm willing to do anything
to preserve that.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.693
Anything.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.498
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I've got a job to do.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.133
No, no, I'm-- I'm just saying that...

06:07.767 --> 06:10.837
I have a job I could do as well.

06:14.640 --> 06:19.612
Thank you, but I'm a happily married man,
and I like the one I get on my birthday.

06:23.483 --> 06:24.150
Okay...

06:24.584 --> 06:26.753
-I need to speak to the owner.
-Yeah, that's me.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.989
I'm a co-owner. So, if you wanna
harass somebody, start with me.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.023
No, no, no.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.992
Nobody's gonna harass.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.995
We'll talk, we'll kibitz, we'll schmooze.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.564
He's not gonna talk to you,
and neither am I.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.733
Ah! You just did.

06:41.934 --> 06:42.935
Don't feel bad.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.037
You've been Schwartzed.

06:45.972 --> 06:46.906
Come on.

06:48.508 --> 06:49.709
You think he's gonna crack?

06:49.776 --> 06:52.011
No, he's good. Black don't crack.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.750
Guys, I don't wanna alarm anybody,
but I am dying.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.921
You're not dying, you're just...

07:02.121 --> 07:03.623
-shitballing.
-No.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.527
No, I'm dying. I'm gonna die a virgin.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.098
Okay, a butt virgin.

07:14.867 --> 07:18.471
Come on, sun.
Don't be an asshole, light this shit.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.676
It's never gonna light it now,
you called him an asshole.

07:23.743 --> 07:24.777
Oh, man.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.548
How did that dipshit
from Cast Away make fire?

07:29.115 --> 07:31.851
I don't know.
He had a dumb-ass volleyball to help him.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.454
Man, I was gonna pack a volleyball.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.691
What about other movies?
Come on, we gotta think.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.593
- Well, in Hunger Games--
- Right.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.996
Katniss is on fire
because Cinna designed her a dress

07:44.063 --> 07:46.599
with a flaming train
for The Parade of Tributes.

07:46.666 --> 07:47.834
That's crazy.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.604
-Oh, shit.
-What?

07:52.071 --> 07:54.941
Did you just hear what I said, Dank?

07:55.475 --> 07:59.979
I just remembered plot details
from a movie I saw years ago.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.249
Holy shit, I remember that.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.686
-Oh, my God. We're getting not high!
-Oh, my God. We're getting not high!

08:06.752 --> 08:07.987
Oh, okay, okay.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.956
We gotta get this fire started.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.124
-I know, I got it.
-Yeah, what is it?

08:12.692 --> 08:15.261
-I'm gonna rub these sticks together.
-You know how to do that?

08:15.528 --> 08:17.597
I watched Survivor all the time
in college.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.632
Holy shit, I went to college!

08:25.638 --> 08:28.274
So, you're working with your mom.
That's nice.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.178
My dad wanted me
to join him at the shoe store.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.645
He still does.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.850
He calls me last week, 85 years young,
God bless him, says to me:

08:37.917 --> 08:40.953
"Son, as long as people have feet,

08:41.287 --> 08:42.822
they're gonna need shoes."

08:45.224 --> 08:46.826
Why are you here?

08:47.660 --> 08:48.661
Shoe-store trivia.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.831
The little thing you step into
to measure your feet?

08:52.298 --> 08:54.901
That's called a Brannock Device.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.304
Why are you here?

08:59.906 --> 09:02.875
All right, not a small-talker.
I appreciate that.

09:03.242 --> 09:08.748
Well, if you must know, a certain
YouTube video has come to our attention.

09:09.615 --> 09:10.950
Couple of your friends

09:11.017 --> 09:13.953
seen handing out some of your cannabis...

09:14.587 --> 09:16.622
to people of insufficient age.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.991
That's not so good.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.727
Those fuck-sticks.

09:24.897 --> 09:29.235
Oy, don't go all buggaro
taking my Sheilas, you wallaby lickers!

09:30.703 --> 09:34.674
Pete, Pete. Yelling at these guys
in fake Australian is not gonna help.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.243
Why do you talk like that anyway?

09:38.210 --> 09:40.279
Don't know. Good ask.

09:42.114 --> 09:43.883
Do you remember when it started?

09:44.917 --> 09:46.218
I don't wanna talk about it.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.121
You know, in therapy,

09:49.622 --> 09:52.224
I've learned that sometimes
it's better to talk about things

09:52.291 --> 09:54.060
instead of keeping them buried.

09:54.727 --> 09:55.595
Buried?

09:59.231 --> 10:00.766
Freeze! Police search warrant.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.902
- They're raiding the compound.
- Stay in your room, Pete.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.203
I have to get my plants.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.706
No, stay in your room
and keep watching the movie.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.107
Take the back and fan out.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.877
That's not a knife.
That's a knife.

10:12.211 --> 10:13.279
That's not a knife.

10:13.846 --> 10:14.814
That's a knife.

10:15.147 --> 10:16.315
That's not a knife.

10:16.816 --> 10:17.950
That's a knife.

10:18.684 --> 10:19.919
That's not a knife.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.787
That's a knife.

10:26.058 --> 10:27.360
That's Crocodile Dundee.

10:30.863 --> 10:33.332
-What?
-That's a line from the movie.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.702
The movie I watched while I was hiding.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.039
Oh, my God, Carter.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.074
That's not a knife.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.210
That's a breakthrough.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.181
You gotta get me out of here.
I'll do anything.

10:55.788 --> 10:56.856
Anything.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.795
Why don't I take
a rain check on that?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.334
Agent Sanchez.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.202
There's always a Sanchez.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.006
- Yeah?
- Agent San-- Oh.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.175
Ooh. I like your pretend dick.

11:19.111 --> 11:22.081
My friend Maria here, she's a patient
and she's very frightened.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.450
I mean, could you just check her ID

11:24.717 --> 11:26.919
-and send her home, okay?
-License.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.055
Um, about that picture,

11:29.722 --> 11:30.689
it's baby weight.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.224
Plus, I had just eaten a cake.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.031
I'm not gonna make it, Jenny.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.801
Just leave me here to die.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.005
Look, I was almost a doctor,

11:46.072 --> 11:48.441
and I'm not gonna let you die on me,
you son of a bitch!

11:49.708 --> 11:50.876
Olivia,

11:50.943 --> 11:52.778
I want you to put your right foot in.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.949
Great. Remember
that right foot you just put in?

11:57.016 --> 11:58.451
-Yeah.
-I want you to take it out.

11:58.717 --> 11:59.985
-But I'm so scared.
-Do it!

12:01.320 --> 12:03.089
I want you to put your right foot in,

12:03.155 --> 12:06.258
and this time, goddamn it,
I want you to shake it all about!

12:07.259 --> 12:08.894
Yes, yes!

12:09.728 --> 12:10.896
Yes!

12:12.865 --> 12:17.770
Look, all I need is something
to show my boss, so I can say:

12:17.837 --> 12:20.272
"Marjorie, here's what I confiscated.

12:20.739 --> 12:24.376
I've done my job.
Case closed, it's Miller Time."

12:27.179 --> 12:29.181
That's an old reference, you're too young.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.250
What do you wanna confiscate?

12:31.817 --> 12:34.353
You know, the weed, your assets.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.188
-Cash.
-Yes.

12:36.956 --> 12:41.327
Assets. It's a cash business,
I know you've got a safe somewhere.

12:41.393 --> 12:45.531
And don't tell me it's this safe,
because this safe is filled with Snapple.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.069
Peach Mango-steen.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.139
What is that,
Bruce Springsteen's fruity cousin?

12:54.807 --> 12:58.210
Oh, come on, Travis, that's funny.
Even Sanchez liked it.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.380
Look, I don't know anything about a safe.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.983
Ugh. You're killing me here, Travis.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.953
Now I gotta threaten you
with jail time for distro to a minor.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.522
Ooh.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.924
Slugs have four noses.

13:14.927 --> 13:15.794
So...

13:19.098 --> 13:20.099
where's the safe?

13:20.566 --> 13:21.934
I don't rat.

13:23.836 --> 13:24.503
Travis...

13:39.018 --> 13:40.019
That's good.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.325
You're not like your mother.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.828
You're not some firebrand
out to stick it to the man.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.531
You're not cut out for jail.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.369
Yeah, you're right. You know,
my mother and I are very different.

13:57.436 --> 13:58.437
You know, we don't...

13:59.305 --> 14:01.874
see eye to eye on a whole lot.
But there is...

14:02.341 --> 14:04.143
There's one thing we do agree on:

14:05.244 --> 14:06.612
Fuck you.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.386
Oy, the language.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.035
My goodness, I am so not high right now.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.572
-Why is my hair like this?
-I don't know.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.945
That is so much more sensible.

14:40.012 --> 14:40.880
Yeah.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.051
You know, now that we mention it,
this smells terrible.

14:48.954 --> 14:50.990
I wish we had something to read up here.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.392
Oh, I would kill
for a Wall Street Journal right now.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.329
You know, speaking of finance,

14:57.563 --> 15:02.334
I think it's time we lay out a realistic
five-year plan for our future together.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.637
I mean, five years?
Isn't that a tad shortsighted.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.940
We should do ten years at least
in this uncertain environment.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.441
I mean, no offense, darling.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.043
None taken, love.

15:15.114 --> 15:18.384
So, I'll focus on selling
my jewelry on Etsy

15:19.051 --> 15:20.920
and you can get your teaching certificate.

15:20.986 --> 15:21.954
Huh.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.223
You know, if I can just reach one child.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.457
Oh, just one.

15:26.125 --> 15:26.992
Just one.

15:31.363 --> 15:32.264
I'm feeling good.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.700
I'm feeling really good
about where we're at, Dabby.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.302
Me too, Steve.

15:42.308 --> 15:45.477
-We should write some of this down, no?
-Oh, yeah, that's smart.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.613
-Oh, here's a pencil.
-Okay.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.715
Do you have something to write on?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.251
We could write on this matchbook.

15:55.187 --> 15:56.722
-Steve.
-Yeah?

15:56.989 --> 15:58.490
Are you pulling my leg?

15:59.491 --> 16:03.662
How are you gonna write a ten-year plan
on a matchbook, you silly goose?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.465
It'd be a really fun challenge.

16:06.532 --> 16:10.035
We could write around the words here.
Write on this empty flap there.

16:10.102 --> 16:13.272
We could write on this empty flap.
We could move these matches and...

16:19.011 --> 16:19.745
Go, go, go.

16:20.412 --> 16:21.547
Yes, you got this, baby.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.248
You got this, baby.

16:23.449 --> 16:24.683
Yeah, light that shit.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.185
Yeah, light that shit.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.386
Oh, yeah.

16:29.188 --> 16:30.255
Mind if I hit the head?

16:30.723 --> 16:31.590
Yeah.

16:32.257 --> 16:33.359
Dope-ass rifle.

16:34.393 --> 16:35.260
AR-15?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.697
Collapsible stock, single-point sling...

16:40.165 --> 16:41.200
vertical foregrip.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.035
Did three tours in Iraq.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.104
Thank you for your service.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.308
No, no, thank you
for protecting vets, like me,

16:49.708 --> 16:52.144
from the medicine
that might actually help us.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.220
I'm gonna go pee-pee now.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.262
Well, I'm done with junior here. Ruth...

17:11.163 --> 17:12.031
you're up next.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.565
I didn't rat.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.267
That's my boy.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.667
That's my boy.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.271
That's my boy in there.
That's my son, Pete.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.173
Oh, this ought to be good.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.810
Hi, yeah, let the gentleman through.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.281
Peter, my son. Heh.

17:30.616 --> 17:31.750
Hi.

17:31.817 --> 17:35.054
I'm Tae Kwon Douglas
from Intensity Plus Fight School.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.825
What's wrong with him?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.795
He gets kicked in the head a lot.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.599
Okay, well, I'm Special Agent Schwartz

17:47.666 --> 17:49.768
of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.336
What can I do for you?

17:51.403 --> 17:53.705
Well, it's simple, really.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.407
I run the dojang next door,

17:55.474 --> 17:58.710
and my son Pete and I were playing
a little stickball in the alley.

17:58.777 --> 18:02.614
And I hit a pop drive right through
the back door of this opium den...

18:03.449 --> 18:05.284
and Pete followed the ball in here.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.119
Good hustle, son.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.355
You made your old man proud.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.560
Let's get you back to the house now
for a couple of ice-cream sodas, huh?

18:15.227 --> 18:19.198
-Douglas--
-I told you not to call me that, son.

18:19.665 --> 18:20.632
Kids.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.167
Douglas, Douglas.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.436
I appreciate you trying to help me,

18:24.503 --> 18:26.572
but I wanna stay here.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.574
This is my family.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.846
Pete, you could be in real trouble here.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.115
I'll be okay.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.251
As a wise man once taught me,

18:39.618 --> 18:43.122
when you choose a path,
you have to walk it with intensity...

18:43.856 --> 18:44.723
plus.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.329
-Wait a minute. Was that me?
-Yeah.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.232
That was good.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.400
Sir, this was a nice moment.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.637
Hearts were warmed,
but I'm gonna have to ask you to go.

18:59.538 --> 19:00.806
-I...
-It's okay.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.376
Okay.

19:14.153 --> 19:14.920
Ruth...

19:18.190 --> 19:19.324
take care of my boy.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.634
Well, he's fun. Come on, Ruth.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.369
Maria Sherman?

19:30.435 --> 19:31.303
Yes.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.739
-We ran your ID.
-Oh, great. Thank you.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.241
Bye, guys! Stay strong.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.913
-You're under arrest.
-What? Why?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.749
You've got
seven outstanding moving violations.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.752
But I had my housekeeper do
my online traffic school.

19:48.187 --> 19:48.854
Come with me.

19:48.921 --> 19:53.458
Oh, my God. I'm-- I'm being arrested
and they aren't. This isn't fair.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.727
Hands off the side-boob, Sanchez!

19:59.231 --> 20:00.799
Ruth Whitefeather Feldman.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.969
You know,
you're something of a legend at the DEA.

20:04.836 --> 20:05.737
You want a Snapple?

20:05.804 --> 20:06.872
Kiwi-strawberry.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.209
Let's get to it.

20:10.676 --> 20:11.543
Okay.

20:12.778 --> 20:15.414
We're here today
because two young people,

20:15.480 --> 20:17.783
Gabby Shapiro and Steve Dankerson--

20:17.849 --> 20:19.551
Those fuck-sticks.

20:20.452 --> 20:21.620
Oh, so you know them.

20:22.521 --> 20:26.358
Well, it seems that they made a video
that clearly incriminates Travis.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.860
He's looking at five to ten.

20:29.528 --> 20:30.896
So, even if he beats it...

20:31.830 --> 20:33.765
he's now got it on his record.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.771
You miserable fucking prick.

20:42.374 --> 20:43.742
How do you live with yourself?

20:45.377 --> 20:46.245
Hm?

20:47.546 --> 20:49.548
How do you go home every night...

20:50.716 --> 20:52.317
and look yourself in the mirror?

20:54.987 --> 20:59.658
Knowing that you're part
of this corrupt, stupid,

21:00.325 --> 21:03.262
pathetic, outdated, insidious...

21:04.396 --> 21:05.430
cluster-fuck.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.499
The war on drugs.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.570
Who are you helping?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.409
And then you threaten my son?

21:18.910 --> 21:20.879
A good, decent kid.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.382
He's never been in any trouble.

21:24.816 --> 21:28.854
What, you got a quota on
young black men you gotta send to prison?

21:28.920 --> 21:30.389
He's your one for the day.

21:32.357 --> 21:33.058
Good job.

21:34.059 --> 21:35.627
Go home to your wife,

21:35.694 --> 21:37.829
tell her what a hero you are.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.800
If you're finished with your big speech,

21:41.867 --> 21:45.504
please keep in mind that
I could have Travis in jail in 45 minutes.

21:46.071 --> 21:47.406
So, again, Ruth...

21:48.040 --> 21:49.341
where is the money?

21:50.542 --> 21:52.344
Where's the fucking money?

22:07.959 --> 22:09.428
Oh, shit.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.534
You didn't have to sledgehammer it.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.602
Just push on my nose, it pops open.

22:18.103 --> 22:19.838
But the thing about a sledgehammer,

22:19.905 --> 22:23.075
once you bother schlepping it somewhere,
shame not to use it.

22:24.476 --> 22:26.378
-Hey, Mom, you okay?
-Yeah.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.547
-I told them.
-What? Why?

22:28.947 --> 22:30.549
They were gonna arrest you.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.019
Oh.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.455
Beautiful stack work.

22:36.988 --> 22:40.692
Lot of these raids, you open the safe,
it's disgusting.

22:40.759 --> 22:42.127
You almost don't wanna take it.

22:42.627 --> 22:43.528
Gentlemen, take it.

22:44.830 --> 22:45.897
This is evidence.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.833
-You'll get a receipt.
-Bullshit.

22:47.899 --> 22:50.969
We're never gonna see that money again.
You're gonna get a Lexus.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.738
You know, I don't like the Lexus.

22:52.804 --> 22:54.840
I mean, it's nice and all,
but let's face it,

22:54.906 --> 22:56.775
it's just a fancy Toyota.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.611
You know what I test-drove the other day?

22:59.678 --> 23:00.879
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

23:02.881 --> 23:03.749
You see?

23:03.815 --> 23:06.384
This brought you closer together.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.386
Everybody wins.

23:10.989 --> 23:13.992
And that's the story
of how we weren't high.

23:14.059 --> 23:17.562
-The scariest 15 minutes of our lives.
-Hell, yeah.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.466
We came this close to joining a gym,
I shit you not.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.702
Yeah, oh, my God, yeah.

23:23.769 --> 23:28.406
So, the lesson for all of you,
especially any kids who may be watching:

23:28.673 --> 23:30.642
don't not be high.

23:31.943 --> 23:35.647
Perfect advice. Life is too long,
you gotta make the least of it.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.850
Yeah, yeah.
And if you ever go roof camping,

23:39.117 --> 23:41.853
make sure to pack a volleyball.

23:45.056 --> 23:48.160
I'm about to smoke
the shit out of your ass, Wilson.

23:48.426 --> 23:49.728
Oh, yes.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.973
Little baby boy

24:02.207 --> 24:04.676
Gazing up above

24:04.910 --> 24:09.714
Listen to your Mama's words
Sung to you in love

24:09.781 --> 24:12.517
We are doomed, we are doomed

24:12.584 --> 24:15.053
We are born to be entombed

24:15.120 --> 24:19.658
We are doomed, doomed
Doomed, doomed, doomed

24:21.193 --> 24:23.829
You're gonna grow so fast

24:23.895 --> 24:26.131
And when you are a man

24:26.731 --> 24:29.634
Please recall your Mama's words

24:29.701 --> 24:31.503
Every time you can

24:31.703 --> 24:34.206
We are doomed, we are doomed

24:34.472 --> 24:37.008
We're conceived to be consumed

24:37.075 --> 24:41.246
We are doomed, doomed
Doo-be-doo-be doomed

24:41.847 --> 24:44.983
Oh, we are doomed, we are doomed

24:45.217 --> 24:47.819
It can safely be assumed

24:48.019 --> 24:51.790
We are doo wah diddy dum diddy

24:52.190 --> 24:54.826
Doomed

24:58.597 --> 25:00.999
And that's the lullaby
you used to sing to Travis?

25:01.933 --> 25:04.870
He was a very happy baby,
he needed a reality check.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.740
Thought I left a bag
of the new weed in the car.

25:09.107 --> 25:10.809
Just enough for six joints.

25:11.743 --> 25:12.944
What did you name this one?

25:13.745 --> 25:15.080
I didn't get a chance.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.682
Maybe Stinky Tea?

25:18.083 --> 25:19.684
Crocodile Dunweed?

25:20.852 --> 25:22.520
I've Got A Kush On You...

25:22.587 --> 25:23.288
OG?

25:25.724 --> 25:26.958
Nana's Fudge Swirls?

25:27.559 --> 25:29.194
No, that shit-ball has sailed.

25:30.295 --> 25:31.930
How about The Worst?

25:32.297 --> 25:35.567
In honor of the worst day
we've ever had here.

25:36.768 --> 25:38.270
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:09.134 --> 26:10.001
Do you see that?

26:12.304 --> 26:13.171
I do.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.207
I see it.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.178
We all see it.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.591
Pete, hit the green light.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.460
Oh, man.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.297
That show's bullshit, man.
That's not what it's like to get high.

28:20.165 --> 28:21.833
Yeah, for one thing, man...

28:22.734 --> 28:25.103
-joints were way too small.
-Yeah.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.439
Whoa, when'd you roll that, man?

28:28.206 --> 28:29.340
I thought you rolled it.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.976
No, it's in your hand, man.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.146
-Oh, that's my hand?
-Yeah.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.750
Oh, shit, man, look.

28:39.050 --> 28:39.918
What?

28:40.919 --> 28:42.387
Far out, man.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.290
Hey, man, we got chips.

28:45.757 --> 28:46.858
You got any guac?

28:46.925 --> 28:49.060
Yeah, we got guac, man,

28:49.861 --> 28:51.329
but we don't have any chips.
