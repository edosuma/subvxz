WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:02.970
(wolf whistle)

00:03.003 --> 00:04.872
ANNOUNCER: It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.907
(laughing)

00:06.940 --> 00:10.811
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FXX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.147
(motors revving)

00:13.181 --> 00:16.850
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.020
- Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:20.054 --> 00:21.322
- I was in Berdoo yesterday.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.390
Told Packer I had
to pull anything

00:22.423 --> 00:23.591
I booked through his charter.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.026
This one has the info
for your folks.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.195
- Western Union.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.797
- The last four digits
ID the branch.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.832
Hermosillo,
Sonora, Mexico.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.467
- Sonora?

00:33.501 --> 00:35.002
- Give your little girl
a ride home.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.604
Get in some
daddy-daughter time.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.106
- What the fuck
is she talking about?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.640
- I'm your grandmother, kid.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.309
Do the bastard math.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.643
- Fuck!

00:42.676 --> 00:43.877
Shit.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.679
- Mercs got Adelita.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.248
- Oh, Jesus, thank God.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.382
- Angel?

00:48.416 --> 00:50.118
You have to go,
all of you.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.553
- Come on, Angel, we gotta go.

00:54.855 --> 00:55.989
- We'll be fine.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.226
- Please don't.
- You have to let me go.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.727
- Go, go, go, go, go!

00:59.760 --> 01:01.629
- I need your help, EZ.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.864
This Agra Park project,

01:03.897 --> 01:06.534
there's a bidding process
that we should have won,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.202
but our Chinese competitor,

01:08.236 --> 01:10.638
they bribed a clerk
in city planning.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.940
I just need somebody
to talk to him.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.175
- Cops are gonna pull
your email

01:14.208 --> 01:15.809
and phone records, Marlon.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.678
Only one way
you don't go to jail.

01:17.711 --> 01:18.879
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.014
You're doing this whole
tough-guy biker shit

01:21.048 --> 01:22.750
for your old piece of ass?

01:22.783 --> 01:24.185
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what the fuck?

01:24.218 --> 01:27.221
- Now, get me your phone
and your laptop.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.259
Shit!

03:19.467 --> 03:21.001
- I hope everything's okay.

04:04.812 --> 04:05.946
- Jesus.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.726
What the fuck we talk about?

04:18.759 --> 04:19.860
Dishes clean.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.363
Don't put empties
back on the shelves!

04:22.396 --> 04:23.864
Leticia!

04:23.897 --> 04:25.299
- Out here.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.608
I got us breakfast,
the place you like on 9th.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.709
- Thanks.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.445
- Mm-hmm.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.546
- You're up early.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.114
- The worm gets
the early stuff.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.085
- Yeah.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.023
- What, I can't
do something nice for you?

04:50.057 --> 04:51.725
It's my way
of saying thank you.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.594
Keeping your promise.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.832
- I like you living here.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.837
Fuck, we had a deal.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.907
No boys. No sucias.
- Coco, Coco, stop.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.844
She's my friend
from school, Gaby.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.816
- You don't have friends.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.789
This was a bad idea.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.391
He's not gonna be able
to help us.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.059
- Hey, wait, wait.
- Ow, ow.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.795
- Wh-wh-what the fuck?

05:29.262 --> 05:31.499
Who did this?

05:31.532 --> 05:33.767
Letty.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.003
- Gaby's family
just came over.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.105
Her mom and little brother
used a coyote.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.340
- This is already
a bad story.

05:40.374 --> 05:43.310
- Yeah, her family paid half
on the Mexican side,

05:43.343 --> 05:44.645
got here okay.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.279
When we met them,
tried to pay the balance...

05:46.313 --> 05:47.848
- They wanted more.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.817
That's the scam.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.184
Why were you there?

05:51.218 --> 05:53.654
- To help,
moral support.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.526
Plus, I loaned her
five grand.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.027
- Where the hell'd
you get 5K?

06:01.429 --> 06:02.963
Your fucking tuition money?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.832
- We will pay you back.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.400
She did it to help me.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.468
I'm sorry.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.103
- You're right.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.139
I don't have any friends.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.941
I'm trying
to change that.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.045
- They still have your family?

06:20.548 --> 06:21.949
You should have
come sooner.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.383
I mean, they could have
really hurt you.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.654
- I'm sorry.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.223
- Who are these guys,
the coyotes?

06:31.425 --> 06:32.893
- They were bikers.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.162
When they asked for more money,

06:35.195 --> 06:36.897
I kinda told them
my dad was a Mayan.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.832
- Fuck, you gotta
stop doing that.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.134
- It didn't matter, Coco.
They laughed.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.402
That's when they
fucked with me.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.208
- What club?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.878
- Patches said Vatos Malditos.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.349
- Fuck, let's go.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.587
- You get the email too?

06:59.620 --> 07:00.888
- I was hoping it didn't
mean what I thought.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.590
- Yeah, afraid
it's looking that way.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.627
- Jesus.
- Mayor.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.928
- Morning.

07:07.961 --> 07:08.996
We know anything?

07:09.029 --> 07:10.097
- They're estimating
time of death

07:10.130 --> 07:11.765
to be between midnight
and 3:00 a.m.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.066
Just started digging,
but we can already tell

07:13.100 --> 07:14.401
this kid was in
way over his head:

07:14.434 --> 07:18.506
credit cards, repos,
defaulted loans.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.373
That's just the legal debt.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.809
His phone's filled with texts
from bookies

07:21.842 --> 07:23.243
and other unfriendlies
waiting to get paid.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.546
Nothing threatening,
but he was buried.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.747
- Was anyone else home?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.949
- No, no, his mom's in Florida.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.217
She's on a flight back now.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.886
- I knew him a little
in high school.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.788
He was kinda odd,
you know, nerdy.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.124
- Any reason to suspect
this wasn't a suicide?

07:37.157 --> 07:39.192
- Not that I can see.
There's no other prints.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.628
We'll talk to a few
of the bill collectors,

07:40.661 --> 07:43.096
but right now,
there's no other motive.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.166
- Guess the bullet
was Marlon's backup plan.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.436
All debts paid.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.648
- * Mother of exiles

08:00.681 --> 08:02.783
* The torch of hope

08:02.816 --> 08:05.519
* In the toss of the tempest

08:05.553 --> 08:08.421
* Threw us Madison's rope

08:08.455 --> 08:10.791
* But the brazen giant

08:10.824 --> 08:13.661
* With limbs astride

08:13.694 --> 08:16.797
* Blocks the golden door

08:16.830 --> 08:20.634
* To the U.S. of Lies

08:20.668 --> 08:24.705
* Damn your huddled masses

08:24.738 --> 08:27.641
* Scrub our floors

08:27.675 --> 08:29.943
* Cut our grasses

08:29.977 --> 08:32.946
* I am a wolf

08:32.980 --> 08:35.583
* A wild cur

08:35.616 --> 08:37.785
* Cut from the pack

08:39.653 --> 08:41.655
* With blood on my fur

08:41.689 --> 08:44.324
* Every howl

08:44.357 --> 08:47.060
* Marks the debt

08:47.094 --> 08:50.664
* 'Cause a beaten dog

08:52.032 --> 08:55.636
* Never forgets

08:55.669 --> 08:58.271
* Every howl

08:58.305 --> 09:01.008
* Marks the debt

09:01.041 --> 09:05.846
* 'Cause a beaten dog

09:05.879 --> 09:08.682
* Never forgets

09:11.418 --> 09:14.454
* Never forgets

09:27.234 --> 09:28.501
- Pop!

09:29.402 --> 09:30.804
- In here.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.174
- Te quiero, Mama.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.347
I grew up here too,
you know.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.750
- Oh, I think I remember.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.517
You were the one
on the other side of the room,

09:44.551 --> 09:46.386
kept stealing
all my shit.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.525
Pop's in the garage,

09:52.559 --> 09:54.628
if you really want
to talk to him.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.702
- You okay?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.505
- Yeah, I'm good.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.044
Man, you know,
the upside to, uh,

10:11.078 --> 10:13.914
Pop not saying much is,

10:13.947 --> 10:15.448
he listens.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.121
He loves you, Angel.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.991
- Morning.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.192
- Pop.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.259
- Want something to eat,
breakfast?

10:26.293 --> 10:27.260
- No.
- I can make--

10:27.294 --> 10:28.395
- I'm good. I'm good.
Thank you.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.631
- I gotta get back.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.135
- Thank you.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.506
- I'll be there
in a few.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.144
- Some coffee?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.580
- Sure.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.453
You know, you can buy
a new coffeemaker

10:53.486 --> 10:54.955
for, like, 20 bucks.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.289
- Why?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.925
This one still
works fine.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.626
Coffee is coffee.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.268
- You look like shit.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.004
- Thank you.
I get that from you.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.817
You been out
to St. Maria's lately?

11:23.851 --> 11:26.586
- Every other Tuesday
with fresh flowers.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.192
- Did you decide
how much of her got buried

11:32.225 --> 11:34.461
and how much of her
got put into a jar?

11:36.163 --> 11:38.899
- What kind of fucking question
is that?

11:40.734 --> 11:42.269
- I'm sorry.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.673
I never--

11:48.842 --> 11:51.812
It's hard talking to you, Pop.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.113
You know, I know you
and EZ connect.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.347
I just--I...

11:54.381 --> 11:58.986
- No, that's on me, son.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.324
- When Mom was pregnant

12:04.357 --> 12:07.027
the first time, with me...

12:10.363 --> 12:13.400
Did you ever worry about the
kind of father you would be?

12:13.433 --> 12:16.904
- I still do.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.472
That worry never ends.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.212
- I'm gonna be a father.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.784
- I didn't know that, uh...

12:34.254 --> 12:36.023
That's wonderful, son.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.730
- No, man, not really.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.533
You know, I may not ever get
the chance to fuck it up.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.037
- Why?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.939
Who's the mother?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.078
- Her name's Luisa.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.049
She's with the rebels,

13:02.082 --> 13:03.650
Los Olvidados.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.988
Potter's got her locked up
somewhere.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.557
- Luisa Espina.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.793
- How'd you know that?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.967
- She came here...
to kill me.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.102
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

13:22.135 --> 13:25.205
- There's a lot in my past
that you don't know about.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.308
- Ignacio Cortina.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.747
EZ finally told me.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.253
- Jose Galindo...

13:40.287 --> 13:44.391
had more than half
the federales in Sonora

13:44.424 --> 13:46.659
on his payroll.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.098
It was safer to take the money

13:51.131 --> 13:53.300
than not.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.602
Galindo knew my family.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.472
He liked me.
He trusted me.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.143
Within a couple years,
I was in his circle.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.447
And so was my partner,

14:07.480 --> 14:09.649
Pedro Espina.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.688
Luisa came here
because she thought maybe

14:15.722 --> 14:19.326
I had something to do
with the death of her father.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.795
I didn't.

14:24.331 --> 14:27.167
The man who did...

14:27.200 --> 14:30.037
God sorted out.

14:31.038 --> 14:34.507
I left two years
before Pedro did

14:34.541 --> 14:37.810
'cause your mother
got pregnant with you.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.082
- I couldn't get her out.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.319
I couldn't protect
my family.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.554
- You don't know that.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.757
- Potter...

14:53.560 --> 14:56.829
He's a slippery,
arrogant fuck.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.100
But he's got weaknesses.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.136
He makes mistakes,

15:03.170 --> 15:05.405
like we all do.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.609
- Yeah.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.612
- You love her.
I can tell.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.317
You'll love your child.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.322
- Breaking news
in a developing

15:22.355 --> 15:24.057
and disturbing story.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.658
Police are at the scene

15:25.692 --> 15:26.859
where a local man...

15:26.893 --> 15:27.995
Has been found dead
in his home.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.429
- Here you are, Dita.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.064
- Officers arrived onto
the scene early this morning

15:31.098 --> 15:33.766
to discover the body
and the gruesome crime scene.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.102
Neighbors are shocked
to hear...

15:35.135 --> 15:36.436
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.704
- In their otherwise
quiet neighborhood.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.272
- Such a shame.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.540
- What's that?

15:40.573 --> 15:43.043
- A man who works
for the city was killed.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.877
Your age, so young.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.048
- Marlon Buksar,
a Santo Padre city clerk.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.050
We will keep you posted
as details on the story

15:50.083 --> 15:51.784
continue to come out.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.754
- The border crisis continues

15:54.787 --> 15:57.157
as more families
are separated...

16:13.606 --> 16:16.109
- It's the mother and brother
of Letty's friend.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.778
Coyotes brought them over
two days ago.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.347
Bait and switch,
want more money.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.651
- It's a fucked-up game,

16:24.684 --> 16:26.519
but why is it on our table?

16:26.553 --> 16:28.821
- Coyotes were a Mexican M.C.,

16:28.855 --> 16:30.490
Vatos Malditos.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.162
- They run TJ.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.030
What the fuck they doing
in our backyard?

16:37.064 --> 16:38.731
- Apparently,
anything they want.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.333
So these motherfuckers

16:40.367 --> 16:41.768
just strolled over the border,

16:41.801 --> 16:44.003
no calls, no respect?

16:44.037 --> 16:45.972
- Letty was there
at the exchange,

16:46.005 --> 16:47.340
told them her pops
was a Mayan.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.341
These bitches laughed.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.912
- Where was the exchange?

16:52.945 --> 16:54.681
- Dogwood.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.983
- Means they got
stash houses nearby.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.951
- Probably more than one.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.071
- You must be
Letty's friend.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.572
- Yes.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.674
This place is beautiful.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.512
- Haven't heard it described
that way before, but...

17:25.545 --> 17:27.847
I guess it has
a certain desperate charm.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.849
- Mm-hmm.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.184
- I'm Ezekiel.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.852
Everyone calls me EZ.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.687
- That will be easy.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.123
Gabriela.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.826
- Can I get you
something, beer?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.594
- Mm, it's morning.

17:42.762 --> 17:43.996
- Right.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.767
Uh...

17:47.800 --> 17:50.470
how about Coke?

17:50.503 --> 17:51.838
Got the kind
with real sugar.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.706
- Sure, thank you.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.269
It's de la Cruz.

18:23.736 --> 18:27.140
My mom, she...

18:27.174 --> 18:29.442
loved poetry.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.644
She'd make me read some
when I was a kid.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.079
- Hmm.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.114
And you remember
this poem.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.318
- I kinda remember
everything.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.087
- That must be awful.

18:42.489 --> 18:46.459
Some things...
need to be forgotten.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.466
- What up, Zeke?

18:53.500 --> 18:54.767
- What's up, trouble?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.603
- I see you guys met.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.439
EZ's not much to look at,
but he's really smart.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.607
That's Chucky.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.741
He's weird as fuck but...

19:01.774 --> 19:03.075
Kinda perfect.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.712
- Perfection
is the quest of fools.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.013
- See?

19:09.716 --> 19:10.883
How long they been in there?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.985
- Not long.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.230
- We fucked up.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.833
We've been so busy keeping
Galindo's plan on track,

19:26.866 --> 19:28.468
serving that master,

19:28.501 --> 19:30.903
we've forgotten who we are.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.405
So has everyone else.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.607
- Vatos are like
fucking hyenas,

19:34.641 --> 19:36.976
recruit deep,
barely prospect,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.578
run the pack
up and down the border

19:38.611 --> 19:40.813
looking for a stray calf.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.115
No pride.
No respect.

19:43.149 --> 19:46.519
Just numbers and money.

19:46.553 --> 19:49.656
All this shit going down
with immigration,

19:49.689 --> 19:51.524
lot of stray calves.

20:03.169 --> 20:06.739
A long time ago, Mexico,

20:06.773 --> 20:09.276
I patched the VM.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.712
I was young and dumb,
and they were dumber.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.148
Started with petty stuff:

20:16.182 --> 20:19.786
boosting cars,
some drugs.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.889
Then El Palo
became the shot caller.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.392
Took a turn, got dark.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.159
- Human trafficking dark.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.895
- Mm.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.233
I got out, came north.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.068
- Call Dogwood.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.372
Turn that fucking hood
upside down.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.407
- On it.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.874
- I got the address
of their exchange.

20:41.908 --> 20:42.909
Start there.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.545
- This club
does nothing else

20:45.578 --> 20:47.146
until we clean this shit up.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.636
Lunch?

21:09.669 --> 21:11.037
- That shit'll
kill you, Louie.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.706
- Eh, I like to live
on the edge.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.774
- Of chronic obesity?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.242
- Hey, why don't you shut--

21:16.275 --> 21:18.277
- So you got
something for us?

21:18.311 --> 21:22.248
- And if I do, you gonna knock
your cut back down to 12%?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.453
- All right, you show us,
then we'll talk.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.588
- All right.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.857
My primo said
this house down here

21:30.890 --> 21:33.192
got bikers coming and going
all day long.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.018
- Fuckin' idiot.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.388
- Our cut just
went up to 30.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.055
- Hey, that shit
ain't cool, man.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.624
Hey.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.393
- Any change
with your business?

22:06.426 --> 22:07.760
Someone stepping
on your game?

22:07.794 --> 22:10.262
- Nah, nah, uh,
shit's been pretty even.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.699
- Riz and Gilly,
nothing at the drop spot.

22:17.704 --> 22:18.838
- What?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.776
- If the VM have people
holed up in a stash house,

22:23.810 --> 22:25.778
that's a lot
of mouths to feed.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.680
- Hell yeah, Stanford.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.016
Yo, who does deliveries
around here?

22:30.049 --> 22:31.551
- Besides Imperial Junction,

22:31.584 --> 22:34.487
could check out Silvano's,
House of Phoenix.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.656
- You ain't got no Postmates,
DoorDash in this hood?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.190
- Yeah, we got DoorDash.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.659
That's when motherfuckers run
from their car to their house

22:39.692 --> 22:40.860
hoping not to get shot.

22:51.504 --> 22:52.805
- What you got?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.507
- I checked the pizza place
and two other spots.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.742
Nothing.

22:55.775 --> 22:56.976
- Silvano's looks like a front

22:57.009 --> 22:58.545
for something
I don't wanna know about.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.380
You got something?

23:01.414 --> 23:03.483
- Dumplings
and some egg rolls...

23:04.584 --> 23:06.052
And an address.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.854
Made five big deliveries
last week.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.722
- Let's go make
a delivery.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.330
- Windows are all covered up.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.132
Can't see any movement inside.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.301
It all looks kinda sketch.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.872
- No one's posted outside.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.440
They're not expecting company.

23:27.474 --> 23:30.042
-  Let's go give
these Vatos their dim sum.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.784
- Delivery.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.086
- Delivery?

23:41.954 --> 23:44.356
- Oh, come on, man,
someone did.

24:08.414 --> 24:09.982
- Oh, fuck.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.017
- Runner out the back!

24:12.719 --> 24:13.920
- Hola.

24:21.427 --> 24:22.729
- Hey!

24:26.733 --> 24:28.100
- Go.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.039
- Shit.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.607
All men.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.809
- Same here, four.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.210
- Go.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.154
- Jesus.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.493
- Gaby's mom ain't here.

24:54.527 --> 24:55.928
- No little brother either.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.268
- Four Vatos:
two dead, one fucked up,

25:02.301 --> 25:04.103
one still whole.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.748
- I don't know, man.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.164
- Gracias.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.506
- There were.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.209
But they took them away.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.144
- Took them where?

25:45.177 --> 25:46.846
- Closer to the border.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.916
The cages.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.684
That's where they take you
if you don't pay.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.687
They traffic the young ones
and put down the rest.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.388
- Where are the cages?

25:57.590 --> 25:59.525
- I don't know.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.393
I never been there.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.555
- Shit!

26:29.588 --> 26:31.157
- My bad.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.632
- Mm.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.416
- Here's fine.
- Yes, ma'am.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.265
- Hey.
- Mi amor.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.768
- Peña tell you why
she wanted to see us?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.103
- No. Hopefully it's about

27:17.136 --> 27:20.306
all your hard work
finally paying off.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.479
- Have a seat.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.928
One of our clerks,
Marlon Buksar,

27:41.961 --> 27:43.696
was found dead this morning.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.767
- I saw it on the news.
What happened?

27:47.800 --> 27:50.803
- Looks like he, uh--
he took his own life.

27:51.904 --> 27:55.074
It was very tragic,
very unexpected.

27:56.709 --> 27:57.944
- Uh, I'm sorry.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.646
I'm confused what any of this
has to do with us.

28:02.648 --> 28:05.785
- Marlon sent an email
last night to myself,

28:05.818 --> 28:09.021
city planning,
and several town councilmembers

28:09.055 --> 28:11.991
confessing to taking bribes
for insider information

28:12.024 --> 28:13.659
on the Agra Park project.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.462
Armed with these detailed
and unfair facts,

28:16.495 --> 28:19.198
ChinAgra presented
the best bid.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.300
- What does that mean
for the project?

28:21.333 --> 28:23.102
- We throw out the bid.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.404
ChinAgra's out of the running,

28:25.437 --> 28:27.940
which is why
I brought you in today.

28:27.974 --> 28:31.543
It won't be confirmed
until city council reviews it,

28:31.577 --> 28:34.346
but from what myself
and city planning has seen,

28:34.380 --> 28:38.350
Galindo Enterprises
has submitted

28:38.384 --> 28:41.153
the most advantageous proposal.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.624
- Hmm.

28:45.657 --> 28:49.361
Well, you know, the
circumstances with this clerk,

28:49.395 --> 28:51.798
they're sad and unfortunate,

28:51.831 --> 28:54.533
but this project
is too important.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.103
I'm glad it's finally
moving forward.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.570
- Yes, we all are.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.775
And moving forward,
I just need--

29:02.809 --> 29:05.577
Santo Padre
needs some assurances.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.847
- Of course.

29:07.880 --> 29:08.948
- We have to know that

29:08.981 --> 29:10.950
these sad and unfortunate
circumstances

29:10.983 --> 29:12.618
never happen again.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.687
- Of course it won't.

29:15.721 --> 29:18.057
This agricultural rebirth
will be the best thing

29:18.090 --> 29:20.159
that's ever happened
to Santo Padre.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.328
Thank you.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.911
Jesus, awful way
to get good news.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.412
- Yes, I--

29:42.048 --> 29:44.550
What did Peña mean,
that this sad

29:44.583 --> 29:47.219
and unfortunate circumstance
can't happen again?

29:47.253 --> 29:49.956
And this clerk, did you know
about any of this?

29:49.989 --> 29:51.457
- No, I've seen him
a few times.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.758
He works for Ileana.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.894
- That's my point, Emily.

29:54.927 --> 29:57.263
Ileana gave you
inside information,

29:57.296 --> 29:59.198
then her clerk does
the same thing for the Chinese,

29:59.231 --> 30:00.566
and when that bid wins--

30:00.599 --> 30:02.634
- He kills himself.
I get it.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.837
I don't know anything
more than you do.

30:04.871 --> 30:07.406
They said on the news
that he was troubled,

30:07.439 --> 30:08.941
that he owed a lot of money.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.745
What is it you're
asking me, Miguel?

30:16.648 --> 30:18.584
- Is there anything
I need to know?

30:18.617 --> 30:20.319
- Yes.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.989
You need to know
that Galindo Enterprises,

30:23.022 --> 30:24.590
your legacy,

30:24.623 --> 30:27.526
it moves one step further
from the border and bloodshed.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.263
Proud of you.

31:02.828 --> 31:04.396
- Flores Pequeñas?

31:04.430 --> 31:05.697
- Please.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.500
Nestor.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.102
- What's up, Mikey?

31:10.136 --> 31:12.905
- Keep me posted
when and where my wife goes.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.341
- 24-7?

31:16.242 --> 31:18.444
- Yes.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.026
- This is as close
as we're gonna get.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.228
Let's prep here.
Let Creep and Gilly know.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.763
- Right.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.167
- This shit could blow up,
get messy with the VM.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.401
You good with that?

31:42.434 --> 31:44.003
- You don't have
to ask me that question.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.371
- Mm.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.250
- You okay, Bish?

31:58.284 --> 32:00.886
- Yeah, just updating
the other Kings,

32:00.919 --> 32:02.254
letting them know
where this is at.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.590
- We will shut
this shit down,

32:04.623 --> 32:06.092
send a clear message
to the VM.

32:06.125 --> 32:09.061
- Ah, if I was doing my job,
we wouldn't need a message.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.496
- Come on, man.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.531
Shit you've done
for the M.C. in the last year,

32:12.564 --> 32:14.566
it's fucking epic.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.168
- Yeah.

32:16.202 --> 32:17.536
- Hey, if you want,

32:17.569 --> 32:20.106
I can recite some
profit growth statistics.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.807
- I'm sure you could.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.211
It's good
to have family close,

32:25.244 --> 32:26.712
in the club.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.914
I miss that with Alvarez.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.817
- Think he does too.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.654
- You know what separates us
from all the other scumbags,

32:35.687 --> 32:38.257
gives us the courage
to look into the mirror?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.925
This fuckin'
piece of leather,

32:39.958 --> 32:42.028
the history
that hangs on it.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.762
Means I've earned
the respect of men,

32:43.795 --> 32:46.265
men I love,
men I'd die for,

32:46.298 --> 32:48.067
men who'd die for me.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.203
The money, the weight,
it can't lead.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.173
We have to serve
something greater.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.509
- We all need
to be part of something.

33:00.946 --> 33:02.081
- We're set.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.315
- The old man
said that the cages

33:03.349 --> 33:05.284
are in the southeast corner
of the warehouse.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.919
He saw four,
maybe five VMs on watch.

33:07.953 --> 33:09.421
After crushing
their stash house today,

33:09.455 --> 33:10.856
we gotta figure
they're gonna be on alert,

33:10.889 --> 33:12.491
you know,
maybe more muscle.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.760
- Probably only travel
with who they need,

33:14.793 --> 33:16.162
which means if they
called for backup

33:16.195 --> 33:18.764
and they're coming from TJ,
they ain't here yet.

33:18.797 --> 33:21.833
- All right,
prep for an army.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.335
Pray for a squad.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.992
- Sí, jefe.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.127
Sí.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.195
Okay.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.529
Sí, jefe.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.246
- Shit!

34:09.415 --> 34:10.982
- Go, go!

34:13.585 --> 34:14.986
- Go, go, go, go!

34:21.893 --> 34:23.929
- No!
- Too close to the cages, man!

34:41.147 --> 34:43.349
- Go, go!

34:54.059 --> 34:55.261
- Angel!

35:03.569 --> 35:05.271
- Come on, let's go!
- Vamos, vamos!

35:05.304 --> 35:06.938
- Let's go! Hurry up!
- Vamos!

35:06.972 --> 35:08.607
- Let's go! Move!

35:08.640 --> 35:10.776
- Mama! Mama!
Mama!

35:10.809 --> 35:12.411
- Move! Let's go!

35:15.147 --> 35:17.949
- Go. Go.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.519
Okay, go, go.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.388
Let's get
the fuck outta here!

35:35.100 --> 35:36.468
- Señora!

35:38.237 --> 35:39.305
- Sí.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.513
- We the good guys,
boy scout?

35:52.818 --> 35:54.520
- I fucking hope so.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.802
- Gaby! Gaby!

36:10.836 --> 36:12.404
Mama.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.440
- Gaby. Gaby.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.642
- Leo.

36:29.821 --> 36:31.189
Mama.

36:33.225 --> 36:34.493
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.727
You?

36:43.702 --> 36:45.103
- You okay?

36:45.136 --> 36:46.805
- We never had that...

36:47.573 --> 36:49.207
Love from a mother.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.344
Guess we never will.

36:52.378 --> 36:55.180
- That's 'cause
I killed her.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.550
Hey.

36:58.584 --> 37:01.320
Past is the past.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.121
Dead is dead, mi'jita.

37:03.154 --> 37:05.391
You and I have a chance
to have that.

37:06.758 --> 37:09.395
That thing that you did
for your friend,

37:09.428 --> 37:11.397
proud of you.

37:11.430 --> 37:14.300
It almost got us killed,

37:14.333 --> 37:16.535
but you did the right thing.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.972
I love you, huh?

37:22.541 --> 37:24.510
- Thank you...

37:24.543 --> 37:25.877
Dad.

37:28.213 --> 37:29.581
- Mm-mm.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.350
- Nah.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.218
- Love you, Coco.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.957
- Hey.

38:48.293 --> 38:49.961
- Look who's here.

38:49.995 --> 38:52.964
Oh.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.066
You're home late.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.102
- Sorry, long day.

38:58.303 --> 39:01.507
- Mm.
Oh.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.477
- Dinner.
- Yeah.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.043
- On my way home.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.645
- I wish I was.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.480
Ileana called.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.048
This clerk's death
has hit her really hard.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.350
She's still at the office.
She asked me to come by.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.553
- Of course.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.754
I'm glad she
reached out to you.

39:48.787 --> 39:49.988
You're a good friend.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.923
- I'll have Luis wait for me.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.325
It shouldn't be too long.

39:54.359 --> 39:55.360
Love you.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.262
- I love you too.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.719
- We're alone.

40:53.752 --> 40:56.488
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

40:56.522 --> 40:58.590
- You didn't pick up
or answer my texts.

40:58.624 --> 40:59.891
I didn't--
- I'm sorry.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.593
I didn't know
what to say.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.194
I just figured
the less you knew, the better.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.130
- So what happened?

41:06.865 --> 41:08.600
EZ.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.768
- He pulled a gun.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.803
- Oh, my God.
I--

41:13.972 --> 41:15.707
I had no idea.
I thought he was just a--

41:15.741 --> 41:18.443
- It just happened.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.912
The gun was in my face,
I pushed it away,

41:20.946 --> 41:22.380
and it went off.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.352
- So you made it
look like a suicide.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.487
- After I went
through all his shit,

41:29.521 --> 41:32.257
I realized he had a lot
of reasons to pull the trigger.

41:33.391 --> 41:35.661
I just added your problem
to the list,

41:35.694 --> 41:37.295
sent out the emails.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.900
Had gloves on.
No trace of me there.

41:46.805 --> 41:49.340
- Someone is dead
because of me.

41:49.374 --> 41:51.176
- No.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.813
Marlon is dead because
he pulled a gun on me...

41:54.846 --> 41:57.448
while I was doing a favor
for someone I care about.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.286
- Is that how we do it?

42:03.054 --> 42:04.756
We tell our version
of the truth?

42:04.790 --> 42:06.858
- Our version
is all we have.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.539
Thank you.

42:21.573 --> 42:25.010
I know you did
all of that for me, and...

42:27.245 --> 42:30.215
If there's anything
I can do,

42:30.248 --> 42:31.917
you know, to help you
or your family,

42:31.950 --> 42:35.020
please, please
just let me know.

42:38.423 --> 42:40.425
I should get back.

42:42.193 --> 42:43.995
Good night.
- Night.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.169
Em.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.508
There might be something
you can help me with.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.089
It's a family thing.

44:06.845 --> 44:09.180
(hard rock music plays)

44:14.552 --> 44:16.554
(rock music continues)

44:21.559 --> 44:22.794
(motor revs)

44:30.702 --> 44:31.937
(hissing)

44:31.970 --> 44:33.839

44:41.279 --> 44:44.950
-Hey! Slow down!
-(gasping)

44:44.983 --> 44:46.117
(crying continues)

44:46.151 --> 44:47.819
(screams)

44:47.853 --> 44:50.121
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

44:50.155 --> 44:52.724

44:53.892 --> 44:55.426
-ALL: Three!
-I sharpen my teeth.

44:55.460 --> 44:56.862
-ALL: Two!
-Too hard, too fast.

44:56.895 --> 44:58.396
-ALL: One!
-Look what I just found.

44:58.429 --> 45:00.799
"Week long rental.
Bed to be shared with owners."

45:00.832 --> 45:02.500
What kind of people do you think
you're gonna attract?

45:02.533 --> 45:04.602
Bohemians
with no sexual boundaries.

45:04.635 --> 45:06.972
-(grunts)
-(snoring)

45:07.005 --> 45:08.940
-You guys know
what this means, right?
-No.

45:08.974 --> 45:10.375

45:10.408 --> 45:13.378

45:20.585 --> 45:22.487
-(man groaning)
-WOMAN: Oh, my God.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.489
Look at these
hardwood floors.

45:24.522 --> 45:26.124
(music resumes)

45:31.930 --> 45:34.165
You can't make people
like you,

45:34.199 --> 45:36.567
but if people
don't respect you,

45:36.601 --> 45:38.069
you can make 'em fear you.
