00:10.378 --> 00:13.114
Guys, come on, talk to me!

00:14.882 --> 00:16.484
<i>Habla, por favor?</i>

00:16.617 --> 00:18.052
<i>Yo soy abogado!</i>

00:18.186 --> 00:19.453
<i>Abogado! Abogado!</i>

00:19.587 --> 00:21.889
Oh. Crap,
you already knew that.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.657
Jesus, fellas?

00:23.791 --> 00:24.992
There's a better way
to do this!

00:25.759 --> 00:27.328
Hello?

00:27.461 --> 00:30.164
Ohh. Why are we--
why are we going off-road?

00:30.298 --> 00:32.533
Ohh! Ohh!

00:32.666 --> 00:35.569
Whatever this is,
can we please,
don't do it in the desert?

00:35.703 --> 00:37.071
Anywhere but the desert!

00:37.205 --> 00:40.208
Oh! Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.247
Ahh. Ahh.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.751
This, we can-- we can fix this.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.122
Whatever the problemo,
we can fix it with <i>dinero.</i>

00:54.255 --> 00:56.023
<i>Mucho dinero.</i>

00:56.157 --> 00:58.058
<i>Mucho, mucho, mucho dinero.</i>

00:58.192 --> 01:00.094
Come on, please.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.662
One of you, just you talk.

01:01.795 --> 01:02.863
<i>Habla.</i>

01:02.996 --> 01:05.433
Come on,
before mistakes are made.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.501
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

01:07.635 --> 01:09.903
Please, come on,
just tell me what you want!

01:10.037 --> 01:10.971
Geez!

01:12.573 --> 01:13.374
Whoa!

01:14.775 --> 01:16.644
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

01:16.777 --> 01:18.346
No! It wasn't me!

01:18.479 --> 01:20.348
It was Ignacio! He's the one!

01:56.884 --> 01:59.287
You can't put seeds and stems
in the sink.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.122
Put what or what?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.491
Seeds and stems.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.493
You can't put them
down the drain.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.061
Uh, we didn't do that.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.197
Then what's this?

02:10.398 --> 02:12.633
Regular sink stuff.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.935
Listen,
if you're gonna do this shit,

02:15.068 --> 02:16.704
at least flush it
down the toilet, not the sink.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.672
W-What're you, my mom?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.308
We don't have drugs here.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.276
Uh-huh.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.178
You don't believe us.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.946
She doesn't believe us.

02:26.079 --> 02:29.417
You sleep past noon,
you don't seem to have
regular employment.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.586
Plus, your whole place
smells like a skunk's butthole.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.689
Also, your sink is full
of stems and seeds.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, narca,

02:37.858 --> 02:39.360
we're not doing drugs,

02:39.493 --> 02:41.995
so stop trying to cast,
y'know...

02:44.665 --> 02:46.166
aspersions.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.568
Narca?

02:47.701 --> 02:48.769
Yeah. "Narca."

02:48.902 --> 02:50.638
The feminine version
of "narco."

02:51.972 --> 02:53.507
Conjugate much?

03:02.350 --> 03:04.184
I gotta go.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.387
Just leave the plunger outside
the door when you're done.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.223
But, uh,
it's still clogged, dude.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.792
You do it, dude.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.227
Hold up, where you goin'?

03:13.361 --> 03:15.529
Yo, lady, we pay rent.

03:15.663 --> 03:16.630
You can do it.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.399
It's a simple
up and down motion,

03:18.532 --> 03:19.667
like you're used to.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.758
Okay. Okay.

04:50.891 --> 04:51.759
Okay.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.540
Yeah.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.308
<i>Oh, good.
You're there. Great.</i>

06:16.043 --> 06:17.377
<i>Great.</i>

06:17.511 --> 06:19.780
<i>Unencumbered by curious
eyes and ears, I'm guessing.</i>

06:19.913 --> 06:21.214
Wouldn't have
picked up otherwise.

06:21.348 --> 06:21.882
<i>Right.</i>

06:22.783 --> 06:23.717
Excellent.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.053
Um, okay. Well, then.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.788
Lay it on me.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.856
<i>First things first.</i>

06:30.057 --> 06:32.726
No. I... I believe
we agreed "after."

06:33.894 --> 06:34.728
I'm hanging up.

06:34.862 --> 06:35.763
Okay! Okay, then!

06:35.896 --> 06:36.864
Geez, I...

06:40.167 --> 06:42.970
Okay, if you're...
if you're facing the phone,

06:43.103 --> 06:46.239
turn right 90 degrees
and, uh, walk straight.

06:46.373 --> 06:49.877
<i>You'll see some pieces
of broken concrete in the dirt.</i>

06:50.010 --> 06:54.214
Just pull back the one that's
kinda shaped like New Jersey.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.549
<i>New Jersey?</i>

06:55.683 --> 06:57.585
Alfred Hitchcock in a fez.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.852
Whatever.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.888
<i>Just</i>
<i>pull that one back,</i>

07:01.021 --> 07:03.491
<i>and you'll see
a, um, soda can tab.</i>

07:03.624 --> 07:05.058
<i>It's got a fishing line
tied to it.</i>

07:05.192 --> 07:06.460
Follow that line,

07:06.594 --> 07:08.228
it'll take you
to an old water line,

07:08.361 --> 07:09.963
and just keep pulling
the string,

07:10.097 --> 07:11.965
<i>and you'll get what I promised.</i>

08:11.391 --> 08:12.492
<i>Okay.</i>

08:12.626 --> 08:13.894
Great. Was it all there?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.896
I mean, the rats
didn't eat it or anything?

08:16.029 --> 08:17.197
<i>It's all here.</i>

08:19.466 --> 08:23.971
Okay, well, uh,
tell me, how hot?

08:24.805 --> 08:25.939
How hot?

08:26.073 --> 08:26.874
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:27.007 --> 08:29.743
Well... I still get followed.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.379
Not as often as when
the shit first hit the fan,

08:32.512 --> 08:34.347
but I still see them.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.185
My mail gets opened.

08:38.318 --> 08:42.122
My phone at home clicks
whenever I use it.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.192
So the maestro buying the farm,
it didn't change anything?

08:45.325 --> 08:47.728
<i>No. If anything,
it made it worse.</i>

08:47.861 --> 08:49.396
Skyler White got her deal.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.531
So the only ones left
to go after

08:51.665 --> 08:52.900
are you and Pinkman.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.568
And I heard they found his car
down by the border,

08:54.702 --> 08:57.404
so, <i>adios,</i> dopehead.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.239
Oh, so they're still into me.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.977
Well...

09:04.111 --> 09:05.813
Hey, what do you know
about the nail salons?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.414
<i>Nail salons are gone.</i>

09:07.547 --> 09:09.717
Wha-- Gone? All of them?

09:09.850 --> 09:10.684
<i>Yep.</i>

09:12.185 --> 09:13.520
What about
the vending machines?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.022
<i>- Gone.</i>
- Jesus!

09:16.023 --> 09:18.525
Ah, don't tell me... Laser tag?

09:18.659 --> 09:20.093
Feds found it all, Saul.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.528
<i>But how?</i>

09:21.662 --> 09:24.031
<i>It was shells within shells!</i>

09:24.164 --> 09:25.132
<i>Damn it!</i>

09:25.265 --> 09:27.034
Damn it, okay...

09:28.468 --> 09:29.269
Okay.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.940
Hey, oh, what if--

09:33.073 --> 09:35.542
Let's say there was
an overseas account,

09:35.676 --> 09:37.577
um, Antigua and Barbuda--

09:37.711 --> 09:39.546
Tigerfish Corporation?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.649
<i>- What?</i>
- Tigerfish Corporation?

09:41.782 --> 09:44.051
$850k? I gave it to the feds.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.319
You did what?
Why would you do that?

09:46.453 --> 09:47.420
<i>Time has expired.</i>

09:47.554 --> 09:49.089
God damn it!

09:49.222 --> 09:50.423
<i>- Please deposit...</i>
- <i>You--</i> <i>You put my name</i>

09:50.557 --> 09:52.259
<i>on the board
of a fictional corporation.</i>

09:52.392 --> 09:54.161
I had to give it up.
I didn't really have a choice.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.930
A-And a heads up
would've been nice, by the way.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.400
<i>So it's gone?</i>

10:00.533 --> 10:01.969
<i>It's all gone?</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:03.937
Those sons of bitches
took everything.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.605
<i>Except what you took with you.</i>

10:05.739 --> 10:07.875
<i>And I'm guessing
that wasn't chump change.</i>

10:09.777 --> 10:11.144
Yeah. Well...

10:13.146 --> 10:14.081
Well.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.484
Guess that's it. <i>- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:19.186
Come on,
I just put more quarters in.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.155
Can't you just, I don't know,

10:22.289 --> 10:23.791
gimme the lowdown.

10:23.924 --> 10:24.992
<i>There's nothing else.</i>

10:25.125 --> 10:26.293
Well, that's not true.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.461
After all this time? Come on.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.097
Just fill me in.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.101
What-- Um, how's Kuby?

10:34.935 --> 10:36.636
No idea.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.905
<i>All right, how about Huell?</i>

10:39.139 --> 10:40.708
Huell.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.677
I guess back home
in New Orleans.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.813
DEA held him under
false pretenses or something,

10:45.946 --> 10:47.781
so last I heard, he walked.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.019
Good. Um, how about Danny?

10:52.152 --> 10:54.254
Or, uh, or Ira?

10:54.387 --> 10:55.622
I mean,
any word on those two guys?

10:57.024 --> 10:59.026
<i>They have Internet
where you are?</i>

10:59.159 --> 11:02.329
Well, just, come on,
give me something.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.964
There's gotta be some news.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.269
Uh, remember Bill Oakley?

11:09.402 --> 11:10.537
He switched sides.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.040
He came out, huh?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.674
<i>No, he's not gay.</i>

11:14.808 --> 11:16.043
He's a defense attorney now.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.045
<i>Huh.</i>

11:19.012 --> 11:22.015
Well, I mean, what about you?

11:22.149 --> 11:23.450
How are you doin'?

11:23.583 --> 11:24.885
<i>Oh, I'm just great.</i>

11:25.018 --> 11:27.120
Prince Rainier proposed.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.590
The private jet is taking us
to the palace on Thursday.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.526
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

11:33.660 --> 11:36.329
<i>Well, I guess that's it, then.</i>

11:42.635 --> 11:45.038
I did get one call.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.339
After everything went down.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.177
<i>Kim.</i>

11:51.812 --> 11:52.880
<i>Checking in on me.</i>

11:54.681 --> 11:56.016
No kidding?

11:56.884 --> 11:57.818
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

12:00.020 --> 12:01.188
<i>Your name came up.</i>

12:02.522 --> 12:04.024
<i>Asked if you were alive.</i>

12:05.025 --> 12:06.193
She asked about me?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.498
What did you tell her?

12:11.631 --> 12:12.665
Nothing.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.102
<i>But she asked?</i>

12:15.235 --> 12:16.069
Yep.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.080
Oh, okay. Well...

12:28.148 --> 12:29.216
Uh, I guess...

12:30.750 --> 12:32.119
this is goodbye.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.221
Hello? Hello?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.283
Hi, I need a number in Florida.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.484
Titusville.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.120
Palm Coast Sprinklers.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.656
It's on a road, um...

13:45.158 --> 13:46.994
It's named after a fish.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.061
Uh...

13:48.962 --> 13:51.064
Tarpon Road, right.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.034
Uh, well, can you
put me through? I'll--

13:54.167 --> 13:55.535
Say again, how much?

13:55.668 --> 13:56.569
Okay.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.685
Hi.

14:12.819 --> 14:16.823
I'm looking for Kim Wexler.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.325
I believe she works there.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.130
Another good one.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.432
Oh, hey, Jeffie!
Look what the cat dragged in!

16:07.267 --> 16:08.635
Hey. Hey, Gene.

16:08.768 --> 16:09.936
Yeah. Your mom
was just showing me

16:10.070 --> 16:11.338
this computer you bought her.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.872
Yeah, well, he...
he got it for me,

16:13.006 --> 16:15.608
and I didn't know
what the hell
to do with it, but, uh,

16:15.742 --> 16:17.144
look, Gene showed me.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.946
- You... You go to the box up here...
- Mm-hmm.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.449
...and then you type in
"funny cat videos."

16:22.582 --> 16:25.385
I mean, that's it,
just "funny cat videos."

16:25.518 --> 16:29.022
These funny
cat videos just pop up!

16:29.156 --> 16:30.357
Look at this one. Look, look.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.459
Cat
eating an ice cream.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.027
Can you believe it?

16:34.161 --> 16:35.995
It's like <i>America's
Funniest Home Videos,</i>

16:36.129 --> 16:37.430
but you get to be the host.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.699
Ooh, wouldn't that
be something?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.568
Wow.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.737
Hey, uh, Jeffie,
get some glasses, and we can
pour the ol' Schnapps, huh?

16:44.871 --> 16:45.838
Yeah.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.678
I thought a computer would be
good for her, you know?

16:53.613 --> 16:54.681
It was on sale.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.919
Not a... big buy at all.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.856
Well, I think it's great.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.326
Treat your mom right,
that's what I say.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.694
- Hey, Marion...
- Hmm?

17:07.827 --> 17:10.497
How about, uh,
we leave you to the cat videos,

17:10.630 --> 17:14.033
and Jeff and I
take our drink to go?

17:14.167 --> 17:16.503
I mean, is that car running?
I'd love to take a gander.

17:17.904 --> 17:18.805
Come on.

17:21.841 --> 17:22.509
Okay.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.922
I swear, the computer's
the one big thing I bought,

17:36.055 --> 17:37.590
and it's not even that much.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.059
It's a... it's an old model
on discount.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.294

said nothing to nobody.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.595

just like you said.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.235
- Stop talking.
- But I want to--

17:48.368 --> 17:50.370
Jeff. Stop talking.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.871
I need you to answer
some questions.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.941
First up, you have
a night shift, right?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.409
You mean the graveyard shift?

17:56.543 --> 17:59.045
At the cab company? Yeah.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.113
What are the hours?

18:02.048 --> 18:04.751
They got a 9:00-to-6:00,
a midnight-to-9:00.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.720
- Why?
- Get on the 9:00-to-6:00.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.557
After that, we need to get
our hands on some barbiturates.

18:11.991 --> 18:12.592
What?

18:14.261 --> 18:15.395
You're shitting me?

18:17.230 --> 18:18.565
What're we gonna do with them?

18:22.569 --> 18:23.903
But you said we're done.

18:24.036 --> 18:27.207
You said, "Cross to
the other side of the street"

18:27.340 --> 18:28.575
if I see you coming.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.785

20:28.227 --> 20:29.696
That's right. You're not.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.600
You... You gotta believe
in yourself, little buddy.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.804

One more bet. One more bet.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.739

Viktor.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.715
This is an easy one.

20:51.684 --> 20:55.087
Now, you grab the hundo
before I do,

20:55.221 --> 20:56.889
you get to keep it.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.226
I grab the hundo first,
you buy another round.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.831
Only rule is,
you can't move until I move.

21:04.964 --> 21:08.234
Yeah, but I'm...
I'm so much closer to it.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.736

21:13.840 --> 21:15.742
Yeah, I'll take it.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.792
Yeah, I just wish
I knew how you did it.

22:05.925 --> 22:10.797
Well, you see,
I'm a man of many talents.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.701
And you

22:16.335 --> 22:18.204
Kidding. Maybe.

I need some night air.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.818
Well.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.721
Easy.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.956
Looks like
one of our cabs is here.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.892
Ohh. I'll bet you for it.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.161
No bets.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.596
Come on, now, hear me out.

22:43.730 --> 22:44.564
It's simple.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.232
Don't be such a pussy, baby.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.536
Look...

22:49.669 --> 22:50.803
What?

22:50.937 --> 22:53.072
Simple as simple can be.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.742
Balance this book of matches
on the back of your hand
for ten seconds.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.344
That's it, and the cab's yours.

22:59.345 --> 23:00.447
I'll even pay for it.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.148
You're just gonna punch me
or something...

23:02.281 --> 23:05.485
No, I promise.
My hands won't touch your body.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.587
And I won't blow it off
the back of your hand.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.655
Really?

23:10.089 --> 23:14.360
My body
will not touch your body

23:14.494 --> 23:15.261
or the matches.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.229
[scoffs, chuckling] Fine.

23:17.363 --> 23:18.565

- I gotta win one, right?

23:18.698 --> 23:20.433
All right.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.868
That's right, you do.

23:22.001 --> 23:22.902
Okay, now.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.037

you put in my pocket,

32:33.452 --> 32:35.254
that doesn't
just extend to this job.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.189
That will get you

32:37.323 --> 32:38.790

32:38.924 --> 32:40.092

It's not like he ain't gonna

32:54.273 --> 32:56.342
He is on a need-to-know basis.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.244
Oh. I didn't wanna
show my face.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.279
Did he need to know that?

33:00.412 --> 33:02.214
So, you're not
just distribution.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.783
You're the whole
freakin' package.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.289
You two
actually make the blue stuff.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.259
Here?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.462
That's amazing.

33:17.363 --> 33:18.997
Can you not touch--

33:19.131 --> 33:20.566
I mean, look at this.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.069
I had a fish that could've used
this as a vacation home.

33:23.202 --> 33:26.004
But you're using it
to make the goods, huh?

33:26.138 --> 33:28.340
Yeah. That's a, uh,
round-bottom flask.

33:28.474 --> 33:31.043
- Mm.
- Right?

33:31.777 --> 33:32.478
Round-bottom?

33:35.381 --> 33:37.849
It's a flask for distilling.

33:37.983 --> 33:39.651
It won't be if you break it.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.487
Now, please, put it down.

33:42.821 --> 33:47.226
Okay, so,
if you cook the blue stuff,

33:47.359 --> 33:48.494
then that means
you're Igor and--

33:48.627 --> 33:49.995
And that makes you--

33:51.830 --> 33:52.898
You're Heisenberg.

33:53.865 --> 33:54.700
Wow.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.903
Hey, tell me, how--

33:58.036 --> 34:00.339
How much product
can you churn out
with a set-up like this?

34:00.472 --> 34:02.341
No, we're done.
We're done with the questions.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.910
Mm. <i>- We</i> ask the questions.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.879

34:08.013 --> 34:09.348
and I still don't understand

34:09.481 --> 34:10.549
how you're
going to pull it off.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.084
Listen, when I get
all my ducks in a row,

34:12.218 --> 34:14.253
I'll give you a PowerPoint
down at the office.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.688
But until then, just...
just bring what
we talked about, okay?

34:16.822 --> 34:19.091
And don't worry,
I'm gonna make it work.

34:19.225 --> 34:20.426
I'm taking the $80,000

34:20.559 --> 34:23.061
as a starting point
for negotiation.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.531
Take it any way you want,
that's the price.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.699
And, uh...
I'm callin' shotgun.

34:33.172 --> 34:33.939
I will drive.

34:35.374 --> 34:39.945
Oh, yeah, sure,
I'll just stand, I guess.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.513
Dick.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.115
At least you won't be
rolling around

34:43.249 --> 34:44.516
like the last Christmas ham

34:44.650 --> 34:45.851
in the back
of the delivery truck.

34:45.984 --> 34:47.119
You know, I--

34:47.253 --> 34:48.754
I've got bad knees.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.123
Think you might've
messed up my rotator cuff.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.425
You're lucky I'm not charging
you for my chiropractor.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.826
She's expensive.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.062
But she adjusts everything.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.101
Damn it.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.570
You gotta give it some gas
when you're backing up.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.406
I gave it
the proper amount of gas.

35:07.539 --> 35:08.740
I guess that's why
we're moving, then.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.976
Look, it just was idling
too long.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.744
It'll start.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.547
Oh, you shoulda
just let me drive, yo.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.716
Look, nothing
would be different
in this moment

35:17.849 --> 35:19.951
except you panicking
and flooding the engine.

35:20.085 --> 35:21.587
Bullshit.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.955
Fellas, I was enjoying
the Laurel and Hardy vibe,

35:24.089 --> 35:25.991
but I'm not such a fan
of the Bickersons.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.294
Now, can you get me
back to my office?

35:28.427 --> 35:30.962
I, I got work to do if you
want me to make some magic.

35:31.096 --> 35:33.299
We just need to sit a moment.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.700
That's all.

35:34.833 --> 35:38.003
When it idles too long,
the fuel pump overheats,

35:38.136 --> 35:40.105
and so we just need
to let it cool down.

36:14.072 --> 36:15.006
So.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.008
Who's Lalo?

36:18.777 --> 36:20.111
Who?

36:20.246 --> 36:21.880
Lalo.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.649
You thought some dude
named Lalo sent us.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.551
You seemed pretty freaked out.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.654
Never heard of no Lalo
on the street.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.425
It's nobody.

36:33.559 --> 36:37.563
Hey, are you gonna
try that again, 'cause--

36:37.696 --> 36:39.865
or are they gonna find us,
you know, buried in a sandstorm

36:39.998 --> 36:41.066
a thousand years from now?

36:41.199 --> 36:41.900
Just please.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.182
Bravo.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.950
I second that.

36:59.084 --> 37:02.087
And let me give you
two free words of advice.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.623
Jiffy Lube.

37:04.756 --> 37:05.891
Hold on.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.089
Where did you read that?

38:44.222 --> 38:46.291
<i>Personal Finance for Dummies?</i>

38:46.425 --> 38:47.693
I mean, is it wrong?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.661
Yeah. Big time.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.599

You wanna know my trick?

41:59.450 --> 42:01.319
Play your own game,

42:01.452 --> 42:03.521
don't get caught up with
what the other guys are buying.

42:03.655 --> 42:04.489
Mm-hmm.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.057
Like the man says,

42:06.191 --> 42:09.194
you never know
who's swimming nude
until the tide goes out.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.997
I guess.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.532
But, I mean,
with this financial stuff,

42:14.666 --> 42:16.267
it feels like
the game is rigged.

42:16.401 --> 42:17.669
The big guys
always win.

42:17.803 --> 42:19.104
Well...

42:19.237 --> 42:21.907
I wish I could disagree
with you, Viktor, but I can't.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.975
There is definitely dishonesty.

42:24.109 --> 42:28.346
But the majority, I believe,
are straight shooters.

42:28.479 --> 42:31.016
Now, the...
the folks responsible

42:31.149 --> 42:32.718
for, uh,

42:32.851 --> 42:34.920
Enron, WorldCom...

42:35.053 --> 42:37.022
Madoff and his ilk...

42:37.155 --> 42:38.924
Mm.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.626
...I gotta believe
there's a special place in Hell

42:40.759 --> 42:41.693
for those people.

42:41.827 --> 42:42.594
Yeah.

42:44.696 --> 42:48.433
But in my experience,
that's the exception.

42:48.566 --> 42:53.371
Y-You can't let
a few bad apples
spoil it for the rest of us.

42:53.504 --> 42:55.373
In fact--

42:55.506 --> 42:56.742
Sorry.

43:10.521 --> 43:11.723
Those look exotic.

43:12.758 --> 43:14.425
I-I went through that phase.

43:14.559 --> 43:16.427
I took every vitamin there was.

43:16.561 --> 43:19.064
Hey, guess
how many pills I took

43:19.197 --> 43:20.331
to try to keep the hair
on my head.

43:20.465 --> 43:21.967
Worked like a charm.

43:23.301 --> 43:24.302
What are those for?

43:27.005 --> 43:28.573
Cancer.

43:30.942 --> 43:32.577
Oh.

43:32.711 --> 43:33.544
Sorry.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.247
Uh.

43:37.916 --> 43:41.086
Uh, is it, uh... is it bad?

43:41.987 --> 43:43.088
Well, it ain't the good kind.

43:45.423 --> 43:47.926
Come on. More drinks.
This one's on me.

43:48.059 --> 43:49.094
Get two more here, please?

43:55.166 --> 43:56.434
Hey, uh,
it's none of my business,

43:56.567 --> 43:57.468
but, um...

43:58.603 --> 44:00.105
should you be drinkin'?

44:06.812 --> 44:08.346
You only go around once.

44:12.417 --> 44:13.284
You got that right.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.476
You sure you don't want to
take this one, Vik?

44:38.609 --> 44:39.644
I can wait.

44:39.778 --> 44:40.946
No. It's all you.

44:41.079 --> 44:42.147
Ah, okay.

45:26.024 --> 45:27.425
Feed me, what do we got?

45:27.558 --> 45:28.827
<i>You remember
to take your fish oil?</i>

45:28.960 --> 45:29.761
I did. <i>- B-12?</i>

45:29.895 --> 45:31.362
Did it. <i>- L-arginine?</i>

45:31.496 --> 45:33.231
Got 'em all. Next.

45:33.364 --> 45:35.533
<i>You're supposed to file
that appellate brief
for Hemple by 4:00.</i>

45:35.666 --> 45:37.836
Crap. Um, hey,

45:37.969 --> 45:40.839
could you put down
the travel magazine
and help with that?

45:40.972 --> 45:42.040
<i>Not a paralegal, Saul.</i>

45:43.241 --> 45:45.310
<i>Anyway, your 12:30
just walked in.</i>

45:45.443 --> 45:46.644
Aces. Send him in.

45:48.046 --> 45:49.948
Oh! Enter, Sunshine.

45:50.081 --> 45:52.583
Cast some light
into my cold, dark world.

46:09.267 --> 46:10.936
Hello?
You're on the clock, right?

46:11.069 --> 46:13.304
So give with the info anytime.

46:13.438 --> 46:14.940
When you're done.

46:15.073 --> 46:16.307
No, I can multitask, please.

46:18.076 --> 46:20.178
I'm not gonna talk to you
while you're on...

46:20.311 --> 46:23.014
whatever that is.

46:23.148 --> 46:25.984
You know, LBJ used to have
his underlings give him reports

46:26.117 --> 46:27.618
while he was on the shitter.

46:28.719 --> 46:30.088
Uh-huh.

46:30.221 --> 46:33.624
Well, either I'm gonna leave,

46:33.758 --> 46:36.261
or I'm gonna put my foot
in your skull.

46:38.296 --> 46:39.430
Fine.

46:43.101 --> 46:44.602
But you should try
one of these.

46:45.736 --> 46:47.805
You walk like Frankenstein

46:47.939 --> 46:49.975
after he was probed by aliens.

46:50.108 --> 46:52.310
I can get you one.

46:52.443 --> 46:55.346
It would do wonders
for your chi.

46:59.084 --> 47:00.785
Let's go, lay it on me.

47:05.924 --> 47:07.292
All right. First.

47:08.759 --> 47:10.996
There's your
Mrs. Denise Gabler.

47:11.129 --> 47:12.297
She's cheating, all right.

47:14.132 --> 47:16.101
Limber.

47:16.234 --> 47:17.903
Ha-ha!

47:18.036 --> 47:20.171
Well, at least I know
they didn't spot you.

47:20.305 --> 47:21.572
No one could stay that aroused

47:21.706 --> 47:23.308
with your mug
peeking through the window.

47:26.111 --> 47:27.712
What else you got?

47:27.845 --> 47:30.048
Well, next,
I followed your bus driver.

47:30.181 --> 47:32.717
News flash. He really
does have a broken neck.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.220
Fantastic.

47:35.353 --> 47:37.388
That makes my life much easier.

47:37.522 --> 47:38.689
Keep it coming.

47:38.823 --> 47:40.491
Second story guy
out of Indianapolis.

47:40.625 --> 47:43.361
Lasky. Did a dime at Menard.

47:43.494 --> 47:44.829
Now, if you're looking
for a talent

47:44.963 --> 47:46.864
who'll keep his mouth shut,
you can trust him.

47:46.998 --> 47:49.167
I say he's worth
keeping an eye on.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.069
Second story guy,
second story guy.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.538
I got-- I got more
second story guys in my book

47:53.671 --> 47:55.706
than pimples
at a Junior prom.

47:58.309 --> 48:01.346
What about, uh,
that Heisenberg fella?

48:03.381 --> 48:05.150
High school chemistry teacher.

48:06.051 --> 48:08.086
You're shittin' me. Really?

48:08.219 --> 48:10.155
Walter Hartwell White.

48:10.288 --> 48:13.058
Chemistry teacher
over at JP Wynne.

48:13.191 --> 48:15.660
Working with a former student,
current meth head,

48:15.793 --> 48:16.861
one Jesse Pinkman.

48:16.995 --> 48:17.862
Wow.

48:19.064 --> 48:21.099
Uh, what else
about the teacher?

48:21.232 --> 48:23.234
He has lung cancer.

48:24.202 --> 48:25.270
Jesus.

48:27.205 --> 48:28.974
That's why he can't quit
with the coughing.

48:30.041 --> 48:31.076
How bad?

48:31.209 --> 48:32.910
Stage Three A.

48:33.044 --> 48:34.912
He's in treatment,
more tests to come,

48:35.046 --> 48:36.581
but it doesn't look good.

48:36.714 --> 48:38.449
Now, listen, even if
this guy was gonna live,

48:38.583 --> 48:39.917
I wouldn't go near him.

48:40.051 --> 48:41.386
He's a complete amateur.

48:41.519 --> 48:43.554
Well, you see an amateur.

48:43.688 --> 48:47.592
I see...
170 pounds of clay
ready to be molded.

48:47.725 --> 48:49.527
Well, if the cancer
doesn't get him,

48:49.660 --> 48:51.796
it'll be the cops
or a bullet to the head.

48:53.698 --> 48:55.967
Is that your appraisal
or is that what

48:56.101 --> 48:58.569
"He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named"
says about him?

48:58.703 --> 49:01.672
He doesn't say anything.
The guy's small potatoes.

49:01.806 --> 49:03.308
Yeah, okay. I hear you.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.809
I just--

49:04.942 --> 49:06.777
I got a feeling about this.

49:06.911 --> 49:09.447
This Heisenberg guy's
got something.

49:09.580 --> 49:12.317
It's top of the line product,
that's the buzz on the street,

49:12.450 --> 49:13.584
and I just think,
with the right management--

49:13.718 --> 49:15.987
You know, years ago,
I bought a Betamax.

49:16.121 --> 49:17.588
Good product.
"Top of the line."

49:17.722 --> 49:21.059
Experts said
it was better than a VHS.

49:21.192 --> 49:24.195
Turned out to be a complete
waste of time and money.

49:24.329 --> 49:25.263
Hmm?

49:25.963 --> 49:26.797
Let it go.

49:29.434 --> 49:31.469
Guy with that mustache

49:31.602 --> 49:33.538
probably doesn't make
a lot of good life choices.

49:33.671 --> 49:36.641
So, yeah, uh,
the second story guy.

49:36.774 --> 49:39.110
- Uh, Menard, you said?
- Yeah, right, right, right.

49:40.745 --> 49:42.580
All right,
part of a high-end crew

49:42.713 --> 49:44.815
fencing jewelry up into Canada.

49:46.551 --> 49:48.653
Now, the Lasky kid
caught a bad break.

49:48.786 --> 49:51.322
The cop was driving by
just as he was ducking
in a window.

49:52.557 --> 49:54.292
He did the time,

49:54.425 --> 49:58.496
no one else on his crew
went down. Solid.

49:58.629 --> 50:01.132

50:56.721 --> 50:58.089
W-- Uh.

50:58.223 --> 50:58.923
What do you mean?

51:02.160 --> 51:03.094
He what?

51:05.830 --> 51:09.700
Tell-- Tell him to get his ass
back to the garage right now.

51:14.205 --> 51:15.706
You cutie-patootie.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.412
You think you've seen everything.

51:44.235 --> 51:46.971
Shut that goddamn dog up
and get back in here.

51:50.841 --> 51:51.576
Get in.

51:56.247 --> 51:59.116
You're kidding me.
You're absolutely kidding me.

51:59.250 --> 52:00.318
I'm sorry, man. I couldn't--

52:00.451 --> 52:02.287
Do you know how much time,
how much effort,

52:02.420 --> 52:04.289
I put into finding
the perfect mark?

52:04.422 --> 52:06.090
I have to weed through
all these saps

52:06.224 --> 52:08.693
who have wives
and families at home,

52:08.826 --> 52:10.761
find somebody
who's alone with money,

52:10.895 --> 52:13.498
and, what,
so you can just wimp out?

52:13.631 --> 52:14.999
The guy has cancer, man.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.302
I found pills in his pocket.

52:17.435 --> 52:19.170
Okay? The same ones
my dad took.

52:19.304 --> 52:20.405
For, like, pancreatic cancer.

52:20.538 --> 52:22.740
So? A guy with cancer
can't be an asshole?

52:22.873 --> 52:25.776
Believe me,
I speak from experience.

52:25.910 --> 52:28.246
I can't rip off a guy
with cancer. I'm sorry.

52:28.379 --> 52:31.182
Do you know how many
of the suckers we've ripped off
have sob stories?

52:31.316 --> 52:32.617
Every single one of them.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.119
Besides, it'll be months

52:35.253 --> 52:36.821
before they even realize
they've been taken.

52:36.954 --> 52:38.389
This guy will already be dead.

52:38.523 --> 52:39.724
So, please,
get back in your truck,

52:39.857 --> 52:41.492
go back to the house,
and finish the job.

52:46.063 --> 52:48.633
No, man. I can't do that.

52:48.766 --> 52:49.900
I can't.

52:50.034 --> 52:51.636
Look, all right.
I get it.

52:52.470 --> 52:54.171
You get over it, okay?

52:54.305 --> 52:55.773
Please, believe me. Y--

52:55.906 --> 52:58.509
Before you know it,
you forget all about it.

52:58.643 --> 52:59.510
Go.

53:01.879 --> 53:03.881
Well, l-look,
we're doing really well, right?

53:04.014 --> 53:05.650
Hear me out, okay?
I mean, we're rolling in cash.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.052
We can just let this one go.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.454
Not your call.

53:09.587 --> 53:13.090
Yeah, but I,
I pulled the tape when I left.

53:13.224 --> 53:14.392
The door's locked.

53:14.525 --> 53:15.760
We couldn't get back in
even if we wanted to.

53:18.596 --> 53:20.965
Jeff, come on, man,
back me up here.

53:21.999 --> 53:23.401
Huh?

53:23.534 --> 53:24.835
Oh, well... I, I don't know.

53:24.969 --> 53:27.838
I mean, I can see
both sides, kinda.

53:27.972 --> 53:29.474
You know, forget it.
You're fired. Just go.

53:29.607 --> 53:30.675
Just gimme the camera and go.

53:32.176 --> 53:33.511
Fine.

53:33.644 --> 53:36.180
Good. Go. We don't need you.

53:36.314 --> 53:37.948
And I know
I don't need to tell you this,

53:38.082 --> 53:39.584
but since you're
such a goddamned amateur,

53:39.717 --> 53:41.419
I will anyway.

53:41.552 --> 53:42.753
Keep your mouth shut.

53:56.534 --> 53:58.202
If we're gonna do this,
we should leave now.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.205
We're really
gonna go back there?

54:02.473 --> 54:03.308
What'd I just say?

54:05.109 --> 54:05.910
Jeff, are you in or out?

54:23.328 --> 54:24.094
What?

54:25.430 --> 54:27.031
I'm down for this. I am.

54:27.164 --> 54:29.734
- But, uh...
- But what?

54:29.867 --> 54:31.302
What time did the guy
take the drugs?

54:31.436 --> 54:33.438
We gave it to him, what?
Three hours ago?

54:33.571 --> 54:35.105
I don't even know
if he finished it.

54:35.239 --> 54:36.273
He might be awake by now.

54:36.407 --> 54:37.908
Don't worry about it.

54:38.042 --> 54:39.344
Yeah, but--

54:39.477 --> 54:40.945
I said don't worry about it.

54:41.078 --> 54:41.812
It'll be fine.

54:55.626 --> 54:56.961
That's it. Right there.

55:04.101 --> 55:06.971
Come back
and get me in 20 minutes.

55:07.104 --> 55:09.173
Just roll up slow,
like you're picking up a fare.

55:10.441 --> 55:12.777
It'll be fine. Relax.
