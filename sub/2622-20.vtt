WEBVTT

00:11.803 --> 00:13.804
Are you kidding me?

00:15.890 --> 00:17.141
Joey?

00:17.350 --> 00:21.645
Joey? Joey, Joey, Joey,
Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey!

00:21.813 --> 00:24.898
Joey. Joey. Joey.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.484
Joey, Joey!

00:29.320 --> 00:31.030
Yeah.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.044
Oh. Oh, did I wake you?

01:38.515 --> 01:41.433
Gunther, could I get
another cup of coffee?

01:43.853 --> 01:46.980
So, uh, what do you do when
you're not working here?

01:47.148 --> 01:50.651
- You don't need to fill these silences.
- Okay, thanks.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.988
Chandler, that's your fourth cup of coffee.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.909
I'm drinking lots because I'm exhausted
because Joey started snoring.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.245
He's in a different room. He's that loud?

02:01.412 --> 02:02.704
Oh, you should hear me.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.751
It's not something to be proud of.
Go to a sleep clinic.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.586
I told you, I'm not going to any clinic.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.340
I don't have a problem.
You're the one with the problem.

02:13.508 --> 02:17.553
You should go to a "Quit-being-
a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.721
- They don't have those.
- Yeah, they do.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.224
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!

02:22.392 --> 02:24.810
There, you just had your first class.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.230
I used to go out with this guy
that was a light sleeper.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.524
And whenever I'd snore,
he'd roll me over...

02:30.692 --> 02:32.734
Oh, yeah.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.323
He'd roll me over,
and I'd stop snoring.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.243
Next time you snore,
I'm rolling you over!

02:41.828 --> 02:44.663
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.958
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.589
Oh, the Olympics!

02:56.259 --> 02:57.926
- Have you picked a date?
- Huh? Oh.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.094
No. Not yet.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.638
I still can not believe you're engaged.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.435
Just because it's happening so fast.
Not because you're a loser.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.606
Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?

03:10.773 --> 03:12.774
Mm, she's upstairs not doing the dishes.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.152
And I'll tell you,
I'm not doing them this time.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.071
I don't care if those dishes
sit until they're covered...

03:18.239 --> 03:20.199
I'll do them when I get home.

03:21.784 --> 03:22.910
Yeah. Oh, hey.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.495
Um, Emily found this
wedding dress in London...

03:25.663 --> 03:27.497
- Already?
- Yeah, but it didn't fit.

03:27.665 --> 03:31.084
Luckily, there's a store here
with one left in her size.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.628
But I'm the groom...

03:32.795 --> 03:34.713
- I'll pick it up for you.
- Thank you.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.133
She's got you running errands,
picking up wedding dresses...

03:38.301 --> 03:40.719
Ha-ha-ha. Wah-pah!

03:43.514 --> 03:45.474
What's "wah-pah"?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.476
You know. Whipped.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.519
Wah-pah!

03:51.981 --> 03:54.483
That's not whipped. Whipped is:

03:57.862 --> 03:59.613
That's what I did.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.323
Wah-pah!

04:02.825 --> 04:04.660
You can't do anything!

04:19.759 --> 04:20.841
Hey, Mon.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.595
- I was just doing these dishes. Oh...
- Hey.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.390
- Hi.
- Do you, uh, have a minute?

04:26.557 --> 04:30.227
Yeah, I was just about to
take a break anyway.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.689
So listen, uh...

04:34.691 --> 04:37.067
...I know you and I haven't
had a chance to talk...

04:37.235 --> 04:40.195
...since, uh, Emily and I
decided to get married.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.990
And I was just wondering
how you were.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.616
Ahem. Oh.

04:44.784 --> 04:49.329
If you were getting married,
heh, I would feel kind of...

04:51.833 --> 04:53.709
- You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:53.876 --> 04:57.838
It def... Uh, it definitely took me
by surprise. But, you know...

04:58.006 --> 05:00.299
...uh, I'm okay.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.883
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.802
I just wanted to check.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.555
Oh, that's sweet. Thank you.
Oh, ha, ha.

05:07.765 --> 05:08.890
- You're great.
- Hmm.

05:09.058 --> 05:12.477
And I know someday this will
happen for you too.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.481
- You just hang in there.
- Ahem.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.900
Uh, heh.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.694
"Hang in there"?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.612
Oh, no, I didn't mean...

05:22.780 --> 05:27.242
You haven't heard of a serious
relationship called "me and Joshua"?

05:28.453 --> 05:31.913
Oh. I thought you had
just been on four dates.

05:32.081 --> 05:35.375
I didn't realize that had
become anything.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.503
Oh, yeah. Oh, no, it has become.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.840
Yeah. Oh, no,
those were four great dates.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.259
- Oh. Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.179
I mean, and the connection!
I mean, you know.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.849
Emotionally, mentally. You know?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.726
Physically.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.605
- Wow. That's incredible.
- I know, isn't it?

05:56.773 --> 06:00.400
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.779
And it's kind of like it's a tie.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.868
I gotta get back to my dishes.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.037
- I gotta get to work.
- Oh, yeah.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.461
You know what would
make me happy?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.338
Oh, yeah, no, what's that?

06:21.506 --> 06:25.550
If the four of us could all,
you know, hang out together.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.719
Emily's coming into
town this weekend.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.806
Why don't, uh, we all
have dinner Sunday night?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.892
- That would be great!
- Yeah?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.812
- All right. It's a date!
- Right. Yeah.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.272
"Hang in there." You hang in there.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.985
- Did you say something?
- No, just singing.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.578
Oh, my God!

06:55.915 --> 06:58.542
Oh, look at this one!

06:58.709 --> 07:02.170
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah. Oof.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.589
About half of these will
end up getting divorced.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.343
May I help you ladies?

07:08.511 --> 07:11.012
Yes, um, I'm here to pick up
a dress on hold.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.597
What's the name?

07:12.765 --> 07:15.684
- Emily Waltham.
- Oh, yes, I have it right here.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.359
Would you like to try it on,
Miss Waltham?

07:28.698 --> 07:29.948
Okay.

07:37.206 --> 07:40.333
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.086
I am, aren't I?

07:44.964 --> 07:46.214
Miss Waltham?

07:46.757 --> 07:48.467
- Yes?
- We're closing.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.846
All right.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.056
And could I get my ring back?

08:06.694 --> 08:09.196
All right, buddy. Time to roll over.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.910
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

08:16.496 --> 08:19.748
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!

08:21.375 --> 08:23.168
And a pajama store!

08:28.216 --> 08:29.799
Does she use the cups?

08:29.967 --> 08:32.469
Yes, I believe she does.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.599
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!

08:40.770 --> 08:42.020
Hmm.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.527
Thank you. Heh.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.071
Aw.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.114
Thank you very much.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.034
Oh, thank you for coming.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.541
- Uh, just a second.
- No, no! Let me in!

09:02.708 --> 09:03.917
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.794
- Can you hold on a minute?
- No!

09:05.962 --> 09:08.213
You have to let me in right now!

09:09.882 --> 09:11.800
- Are you alone?
- Yes!

09:12.802 --> 09:13.969
All right.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.478
This sucks.

09:23.896 --> 09:28.149
I have to stay up all night
before I go to the stupid clinic.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.651
I'm so tired.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.154
It's 6:00.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.824
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.660
I hear you and Joshua
are going out with Ross and Emily.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.996
And I think... I think that's really cool.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.498
Yeah, I think you're handling
that really well.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.917
"Handling it"?

09:46.085 --> 09:48.169
What do you mean?
There's nothing to handle.

09:48.337 --> 09:52.757
Maybe I'd have a problem with this
if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.511
- They're not gonna get married anyway.
- What?

09:56.679 --> 10:00.682
Come on. They rushed into this thing
so fast, it's ridiculous!

10:00.850 --> 10:03.643
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?

10:03.811 --> 10:06.771
Somewhere, one of them is gonna
realize what they've done...

10:06.939 --> 10:08.148
...and call the thing off.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.776
You'll be dancing at my wedding
before you dance at theirs.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.029
You know, I don't dance at weddings.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.449
- Why not?
- Weddings are a great place to meet women.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.452
When I dance, I look like this.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.380
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.885
So, what are you guys doing
four weeks from today?

10:37.053 --> 10:38.261
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.472
I am...

10:42.058 --> 10:43.642
...free.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.978
Great, because we're getting
married in a month.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.106
- What?
- Yup.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.566
- In a month?
- Yeah.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.069
- You mean 30 days?
- Yeah.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.237
- From now?
- Yeah.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.199
- That's great!
- Yeah, ha, ha.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.952
Emily always wanted to get married
in this place her parents got married...

11:03.120 --> 11:05.914
...but it's gonna be torn down, so...

11:06.082 --> 11:09.834
I know it's crazy,
but everything's been so crazy...

11:10.086 --> 11:11.878
...and it just feels right, you know?

11:12.046 --> 11:16.091
Hey, that's the day after
I start menstruating!

11:26.727 --> 11:28.269
This isn't mine.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.614
- Ahem
- Hey, Rachel.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.116
Hi.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.992
- What's up?
- Oh, heh.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.162
Your voice sounded
all squeaky on the phone.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.790
Oh, nothing. I just wanted to see you.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.500
See you and hug you.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.086
Ha, ha. See you, heh.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.088
- Great.
- Yeah!

11:56.090 --> 11:57.257
Sit.

12:00.636 --> 12:01.928
You okay?

12:02.638 --> 12:07.517
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.980
Want to know why?

12:12.273 --> 12:13.982
Do I?

12:14.150 --> 12:17.026
Because I am really happy about us.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.321
I think we are so on the right track.

12:20.489 --> 12:24.242
I think we are working.
I think we are clicking.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.369
- You know?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.413
- We're... We're clicking.
- Yeah.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.832
If there was just one little area...

12:31.000 --> 12:34.377
...where I think we need to work on,
I would think...

12:34.545 --> 12:37.922
...it's that we're
just not crazy enough.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.719
I got to say, I'm not too sure
I agree with that.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.346
Well, yeah. You know, yeah, you're right.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.515
I mean, we have our fun. Yeah?

12:47.683 --> 12:49.517
But, uh...

12:50.144 --> 12:53.521
We ju... I mean, like crazy! You know?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.566
Okay. All right.

12:57.401 --> 13:01.237
This is going to sound,
you know, a little, um, hasty.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.989
But, uh, just go with me.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.953
What if we got married?

13:09.121 --> 13:10.705
Aah? Heh.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.419
- What?
- Oh, I know. It's so totally like:

13:16.587 --> 13:19.589
"Whoa, can we do this?" You know?
I mean...

13:19.757 --> 13:22.884
But it just feels right.
Don't you think? It does.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.137
I mean, it just feels right. Don't you...?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.266
Wow. Uh...

13:30.434 --> 13:31.893
Rachel, um...

13:32.061 --> 13:33.186
...you're...

13:33.979 --> 13:35.480
...a real...

13:35.689 --> 13:37.565
...special lady.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.612
But my divorce isn't final yet...

13:42.780 --> 13:45.532
...and we've been on four dates.

13:46.408 --> 13:50.537
So I'm thinking no...

13:50.704 --> 13:52.413
...but...

13:52.581 --> 13:54.249
...thanks.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.585
You idiot!

14:03.133 --> 14:05.176
- Your name, please?
- Joey Tribbiani.

14:05.344 --> 14:09.305
Mm-hm. Did you stay up all night
in preparation for your study?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.349
Uh, sir?

14:14.478 --> 14:15.937
Yes, he did.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.190
All right. We'll call you
in a few minutes.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.027
Whoa. Hey.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.614
Check out that girl.
She is really hot.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.242
Yeah, she is.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.286
Wow.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.706
How you doing?

14:37.960 --> 14:41.546
- What?
- You're coming on to the entire room.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.179
- I'm Chandler. Hi.
- I'm Marjorie. Hi.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.307
- Do you mind if I sit?
- No, please.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.892
So, uh, what are you in for?

14:54.059 --> 14:55.560
I talk in my sleep.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.896
What a coincidence.
I listen in my sleep.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.275
So why don't you
give me your number?

15:05.613 --> 15:07.447
- Are you ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.702
I got it! Mine! Aah!

15:15.456 --> 15:18.166
- Congratulations!
- Thank you! Ha-ha-ha.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.835
- Okay, my turn, my turn!
- Okay!

15:22.463 --> 15:24.088
Okay, ready?

15:27.343 --> 15:28.968
Okay.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.058
That was a terrible throw!

15:35.225 --> 15:37.936
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.649
Look at me. My big concern
is what's real?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.154
Oh, my God.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.490
We're really sad, aren't we?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.744
Yeah, I think we are.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.122
This isn't even my dress.

15:58.290 --> 16:02.418
At least you didn't rent yours from
a store called "It's Not Too Late."

16:09.927 --> 16:12.220
- I'm changing out of this.
- Me too.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.974
- In, like, a half an hour?
- Me too.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.894
- All right, now throw it straight this time.
- Okay.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.815
- I'm getting married next!
- Yay!

16:28.904 --> 16:31.114
I hate my regular clothes now.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.200
You know? I look down and I know...

16:34.368 --> 16:37.370
...this isn't gonna be the most
special day of my life.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.374
Yeah. I mean,
it was kind of fun for a while...

16:41.625 --> 16:43.626
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.420
I guess.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.423
Oh, my God!

16:49.758 --> 16:51.676
Oh, you're such a cheater!

16:53.429 --> 16:54.971
Hello, little ones.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.305
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.307
- So is Joey going to stop snoring?
- Yep!

16:58.475 --> 17:01.352
And a beautiful woman
agreed to go out with me.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.314
Joey wanted to ask her out,
but, uh, you know, she picked me.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.066
How'd that happen?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.361
Because I'm cooler.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.489
No, seriously.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.536
She's the kind of girl...
Joey was unconscious.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.125
Hey, you guys! What's happening?

17:24.710 --> 17:25.960
Oh, my God.

17:26.127 --> 17:29.964
- What is that?
- Oh! They gave it to me at the sleep clinic.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.884
And it's going to help me not to snore.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.055
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

17:37.514 --> 17:40.099
You don't have to
wear it unless you are.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.101
I know I don't have to.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.687
It tastes good.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.899
Plus, you look cool.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.240
Well, I just called Joshua.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.867
Oh, how'd it go?

17:58.035 --> 18:00.578
I did my best to
convince him that I'm not...

18:00.746 --> 18:03.456
...some crazy girl
who is dying to get married.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.417
- And I'm going through a hard time.
- What'd he say?

18:06.585 --> 18:09.253
Well, uh, his answering machine
was very understanding.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.259
I feel blue. Ugh.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.512
- Aw.
- Sweety.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.348
I bet you anything
he'll call you again.

18:20.516 --> 18:24.393
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,
I don't think I even care.

18:24.853 --> 18:28.523
I don't think he's
the one I'm sad about.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.569
I know I said I'm totally okay
with Ross getting married.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.655
But as it turns out...

18:35.906 --> 18:39.033
...I don't think I'm handling it
all that well.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.493
Yeah, maybe.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.705
And I'm just trying to figure out why.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.541
Any luck?

18:46.708 --> 18:49.252
Well, yeah. You know how Ross and I
have always been...

18:49.419 --> 18:51.671
...on-again, off-again,
on-again, off-again?

18:52.381 --> 18:55.716
I guess I just figured,
somewhere down the road...

18:55.884 --> 18:57.885
...we would be on-again.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.387
Again.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.890
You know what? I think we all did.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.018
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.436
Hey.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.525
- Ahem, hey.
- So.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.861
I got us reservations for Sunday night.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.821
How about Ernie's at 9:00?

19:17.281 --> 19:20.408
Yeah, well, you, uh,
better make it for three.

19:20.909 --> 19:24.203
See, I don't know if we're
going to be hungry at 3:00.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.875
Three people.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.002
Joshua's not going to be there.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.881
- What happened?
- Um, well, I think he broke up with me.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.133
No. Why?

19:38.552 --> 19:41.179
Apparently, he scares easy.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.806
Rachel, I'm sorry.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.309
Eh, it's okay.

19:47.769 --> 19:52.732
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you thought they would.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.693
Come here.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.286
Oh, hey,
don't you have to go pick up Emily?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.079
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.498
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.459
I got my girls.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.048
Okay.

20:22.679 --> 20:23.721
Ugh.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.481
Hey, you know what might
cheer you up?

20:34.399 --> 20:35.441
What?

20:39.738 --> 20:40.988
I got to tell you...

20:41.156 --> 20:44.116
...this really does put me
in a better mood.

20:45.327 --> 20:49.497
Ah, I wish there was a job where
I could wear this all the time.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.500
Maybe someday there will be.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.506
Oh, God, that's Chandler coming by
to borrow candles for his big date.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.050
No, Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!

21:01.218 --> 21:03.761
No, yeah!
The groom cannot see the bride.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.888
I'm not going to marry Chandler.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.224
Not after this!

21:09.685 --> 21:12.103
Okay guys, just relax.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.401
I do!

21:22.823 --> 21:25.616
- I gotta go.
- Wait, Joshua!

21:30.247 --> 21:33.165
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

21:38.171 --> 21:41.299
Food's here. Fair enough.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.509
Fifteen-minute warning.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.429
Late.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.779
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
