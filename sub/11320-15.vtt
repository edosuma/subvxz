WEBVTT

00:21.896 --> 00:22.856
All right.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.858
Let me give you a hug

00:25.817 --> 00:27.819
and let's give your mom a hug.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.612
I'll hug you both.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.869
Eun-seong, aren't you hungry?

00:35.952 --> 00:37.078
I am.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.872
-Shall we go and eat?
-Yes.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.466
Did something happen?

00:51.092 --> 00:52.177
Like what?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.304
Nothing. Never mind.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.440
Did you really think I'd be touched this?

01:08.651 --> 01:09.819
Don't do that ever again.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.032
Aren't you embarrassed to face Eun-seong?

01:16.993 --> 01:18.286
It's been taken care of.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.580
My dad overreacted.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.333
Has it really been taken care of?

01:23.416 --> 01:25.960
What's there to not be?
We've done nothing wrong.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.130
Hye-su.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.091
Don't make any decisions
on your own from now on.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.053
I'm your husband and Eun-seong's dad.

01:35.386 --> 01:36.846
The divorce hasn't been finalized yet.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.516
You know it gets nullified
if we don't go to court, right?

01:43.144 --> 01:44.270
Eun-seong,

01:44.729 --> 01:45.855
from now on,

01:46.272 --> 01:47.398
don't call me Mister.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.900
Call me Dad.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.780
Excuse me, sir.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.989
What do you mean, "sir"?

01:55.698 --> 01:56.908
I told you to call me by my name.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.910
No.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.288
Since "darling" or "sweetie"
is a bit too much,

02:02.372 --> 02:03.498
just call me "honey."

02:04.916 --> 02:07.293
And stop doing stupid things.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.670
Just do as I say.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.338
First,

02:10.547 --> 02:11.756
we should move in together.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.383
Let's find a place to live.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.467
Excuse me.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.552
Eun-seong,

02:16.636 --> 02:19.055
can you try calling me Dad?

02:23.184 --> 02:24.310
Dad.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.190
Eun-seong, one more time.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.025
Dad.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.444
Oh, my gosh. My daughter.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.573
You adorable little thing.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.326
Who am I?

02:40.702 --> 02:41.828
Dad.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.040
Not a single word

02:47.417 --> 02:50.295
from today's board meeting can reach
the media.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.963
First,

02:52.505 --> 02:54.007
silence the board members.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.259
Make sure no one talks about

02:57.218 --> 03:00.138
organ trafficking or anything like that.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.806
Yes, sir.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.725
Call Attorney Oh,

03:04.934 --> 03:06.728
and tell him to come up with a plan.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.021
Yes, sir.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.991
I heard Han Ji-hun resigned.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.868
He must have caused some big trouble.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.745
I heard he resigned before word got out.

03:23.828 --> 03:24.829
I see.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.206
Gosh, he was just promoted though.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.917
-I know.
-The older son must be happy.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.919
Goodness.

03:39.510 --> 03:40.637
Hello, Mr. Hong.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.473
You haven't forgotten your promise,
have you?

03:44.641 --> 03:46.351
Let's grab a meal sometime.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.773
Good work, everyone.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.858
Let's grab a drink.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.527
Good job, everyone.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.321
-Hello.
-Hello.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.697
Can I have a moment?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.413
Thank you for everything.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.167
I won't be working here anymore
after the end of this month.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.463
-What did he say?
-He's quitting.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.757
It's thanks to you

04:18.007 --> 04:20.093
that The Promise has come this far.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.428
If I upset you in any way,

04:22.887 --> 04:24.389
please be generous and forget about it.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.517
I know I did many stupid things.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.395
Why are you suddenly--

04:30.478 --> 04:31.771
You're here,

04:32.313 --> 04:33.439
Mr. Han.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.942
I'll take care of things before I leave.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.027
Let me know if there's
anything you're unhappy with.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.696
I'll try to handle it before I leave.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.419
Hey.

04:54.752 --> 04:55.920
What's going on?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.255
Spit it out.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.090
What are you talking about?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.635
I committed a crime,
so I should step down.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.345
What crime?

05:04.512 --> 05:06.973
Your mom didn't even get the surgery
with Hye-su.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.392
Why should you quit over that?

05:09.726 --> 05:12.979
You should've denied it
and stood your ground.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.814
It's okay.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.024
I feel relieved.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.650
Whatever.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.861
What will you do now?

05:19.944 --> 05:21.112
How will you support yourself?

05:22.071 --> 05:23.740
I found a job, so don't worry.

05:24.907 --> 05:25.908
Already?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.493
Ho-jun,

05:28.995 --> 05:30.288
I'm going to marry Hye-su.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.707
What?

05:32.957 --> 05:35.460
Well, we're already married.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.295
We're going to move in together.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.800
Did your dad approve?

05:42.884 --> 05:44.093
I'm not a minor.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.637
I don't need his permission
to get married.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.515
I decide who I marry.
What does it have to do with him?

05:50.767 --> 05:54.187
Did you get kicked out?

05:54.353 --> 05:56.439
Must you talk like that?

05:56.773 --> 05:59.567
What am I supposed to do now?

05:59.650 --> 06:00.651
Darn it.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.487
-Goodness.
-I'll get fired now.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.744
Hye-su, are you all right?

06:13.831 --> 06:15.333
Yes, I'm fine.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.960
Don't worry.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.713
Tell me if you need anything.

06:21.839 --> 06:22.965
Okay.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.918
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.169
Sit back down for a moment.

07:03.214 --> 07:07.135
I think we should stop the radiotherapy
for a while.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.596
You've gotten physically weak.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.015
And your immune system
is weak right now as well.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.809
The side effects are too harsh.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.228
I think it's doing more harm than good.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.816
You can't get treated
if your body doesn't recover.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.778
What happens if we stop the treatment?

07:29.073 --> 07:32.118
You said radiotherapy was the only option.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.621
My child starts school next year.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.962
Will I live until then?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.341
I think it's because you're young.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.596
The tumor is actually progressing
more quickly than we expected.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.516
Don't give up hope though.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.351
Stay strong.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.122
Has Kang Hye-su come in yet?

08:18.706 --> 08:21.417
She stopped her treatment.

08:22.710 --> 08:23.711
Pardon?

08:24.670 --> 08:25.963
What do you mean?

08:26.839 --> 08:27.965
I'm ready.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.091
-Okay.
-Hello.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.176
Hello.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.469
-Mr. Lee Sang-su.
-Yes.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.845
You may go in.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.100
Excuse me, Doctor.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.314
What does she mean
that my wife's treatment has been stopped?

08:46.192 --> 08:47.485
Has she gotten that much worse?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.153
Yes.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.781
Her condition has worsened drastically.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.116
And her state is deteriorating rapidly.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.287
Is there any way?

08:58.996 --> 09:00.331
We still need to treat her.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.958
You said she's getting worse.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.293
We can't stand by and do nothing.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.879
There's nothing we can do right now.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.882
I can't guarantee anything.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.260
Doctor, how could you say that?

09:12.343 --> 09:14.470
Anyone can say that.
How can you call yourself a doctor?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.597
You need to make her better.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.308
I'm a bad husband,
but you're a bad doctor.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.144
You need to say she'll live!
That's the only way she'll get better!

09:22.270 --> 09:23.521
Please calm down.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.863
Please, Doctor.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.117
Please save her.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.246
We must save Hye-su.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.767
I told you not to come alone.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.020
Why did you break your promise again?

10:04.687 --> 10:05.813
Why?

10:06.897 --> 10:08.024
Goodness.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.817
Good job.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.278
Aren't you hungry?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.906
I'm starving.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.035
Buy me something delicious.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.578
What do you want to eat?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.121
Tell me. I'll buy you anything.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.253
I want chicken.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.090
I want pasta.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.593
I want seolleongtang too.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.890
I want Korean food
with a whole lot of side dishes.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.028
Why aren't you eating?

10:55.404 --> 10:56.405
I will.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.074
If you don't, I'll eat it all.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.209
Let's switch hospitals.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.587
What?

11:12.088 --> 11:15.257
That doctor has a bad temper
and doesn't seem very competent.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.927
I'm looking around,

11:18.427 --> 11:19.553
so let's switch hospitals soon.

11:23.891 --> 11:24.892
No.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.104
I'd rather stay at
the hospital I'm used to.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.898
The doctor is pretty good.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.650
She is not.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.610
She seemed terrible.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.781
She said I was getting better.
Don't worry.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.119
I mean it.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.287
Look how well I'm eating.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.300
Here. Drink some water.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.261
Thanks.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.854
Do you want to go anywhere
after we're done?

12:13.691 --> 12:14.942
Don't you need to work?

12:15.234 --> 12:16.360
Why would I need to work?

12:17.194 --> 12:19.447
I'm rich, remember? I don't have to work.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.782
-Gosh.
-I thought you knew.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.462
Let's go check out places to live.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.882
Places to live?

12:37.965 --> 12:39.341
Didn't you hear me last time?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.218
People will talk bad about you.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.721
How could a married woman live
at a friend's place?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.307
I found a nice place.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.184
Don't worry.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.269
I'll move in only when you tell me to.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.731
When should we have our wedding?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.444
Should I propose to you first?

13:00.404 --> 13:02.531
Gosh. Everything is out of order.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.118
Who cares if it's out of order?

13:07.286 --> 13:08.287
Hye-su,

13:08.996 --> 13:10.122
will you marry me?

13:18.714 --> 13:20.090
Are you proposing?

13:20.382 --> 13:22.259
Yes, I'm proposing.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.969
Why?

13:24.261 --> 13:25.304
Do you not like it?

13:25.554 --> 13:27.264
Of course, I don't.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.683
Is this your first time proposing?

13:30.476 --> 13:31.769
I've gotten a few in the past.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.730
How can you call this a proposal?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.441
I don't know if I'll say yes
even if you do it right.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.363
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.073
The balloons,

13:44.156 --> 13:46.659
the fireworks, and the lasers.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.161
You need to sing and say,
"I love you, Hye-su."

13:49.286 --> 13:50.829
Isn't that
what a proposal should look like?

13:51.872 --> 13:53.290
Gosh.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.251
How immature.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.923
I'm not saying I want that.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.302
I'm just flabbergasted, that's all.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.390
I mean, what's the rush?

14:12.351 --> 14:13.978
So, you don't want to?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.232
I'll think about it.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.734
Marriage isn't a game.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.407
You're so tacky.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.576
Why do you want something so cliché?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.788
Forget it. Forget I proposed.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.542
I don't want it either.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.465
It's good.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.967
Right?

14:46.719 --> 14:47.845
Eat up.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.101
Eat this too.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.020
I am eating.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.316
This place is good.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.909
You said you were eating well.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.130
Here.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.469
Hurry up and eat.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.895
Ma'am, you have a guest.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.064
Hello, ma'am.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.452
I heard the surgery was a success.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.371
Congratulations.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.206
Please leave.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.583
How dare you come here?

16:04.254 --> 16:05.923
Ji-hun's life is at stake.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.925
You need to help.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.179
If he isn't careful,

16:12.554 --> 16:14.223
he'll be investigated by the police.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.767
What do you mean?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.312
Who ratted him out?

16:20.396 --> 16:22.064
He did it himself.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.191
That naive idiot.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.485
You were the cause,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.779
so I came here to ask you to fix it.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.907
If anyone asks,

16:32.282 --> 16:33.909
say that Ji-hun has been

16:34.034 --> 16:36.578
dating that girl for a while.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.373
And if you see Ji-hun,

16:39.832 --> 16:41.667
tell him to put off the divorce process.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.794
If he gets a divorce now,

16:44.211 --> 16:45.587
he'll just buy suspicion.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.591
We should get him divorced
after the rumors die down.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.177
The attorney says

16:52.553 --> 16:53.804
that's the only way.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.223
Why are you telling me to say that to him?

16:56.807 --> 16:57.766
Do it yourself.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.935
That punk isn't in his right mind
right now.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.396
He can't think straight
because of that single mom.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.107
He turned his back on me
and even left the company.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.111
What did you just say?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.990
He didn't tell you anything?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.952
That witch really knows what she's doing.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.580
That naive kid got caught in her trap.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.459
He's an adult.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.753
We shouldn't get involved
in his love life.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.006
He must like her
because she's a decent girl.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.884
-What?
-Please leave.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.469
I don't want to know.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.013
I owe you nothing,

17:36.221 --> 17:38.140
so don't ask me for anything.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.268
How dare you come and ask me for favors?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.812
Imagine how desperate I was to come here.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.024
It concerns Ji-hun. He's your son.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.235
Your son's life is about to end.
How can you ignore it?

17:51.570 --> 17:54.907
-And you call yourself a mother?
-Do you have any right to say that?

17:55.240 --> 17:56.533
And you call yourself a dad?

17:56.992 --> 17:59.745
You're doing all this for yourself.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.039
You think I won't know?

18:02.539 --> 18:05.876
Stop pretending to care about your son!

18:13.092 --> 18:16.512
Did you know that the girl is dying?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.099
What?

18:20.516 --> 18:21.517
Don't tell me

18:22.059 --> 18:23.352
you knew everything

18:24.061 --> 18:26.188
and were still going to get the surgery.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.234
What do you mean?

18:32.528 --> 18:34.404
-Eun-seong!
-Hi!

18:34.488 --> 18:35.489
Dad.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.241
Dad!

18:37.908 --> 18:39.409
-Hi.
-Let me open it.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.203
Congratulations.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.746
-Thank you.
-That's not it.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.248
Come to Dad.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.709
It's not like that.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.003
Did you miss Dad?

18:50.254 --> 18:51.505
I did.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.883
Where are we going?

18:55.551 --> 18:56.552
Us?

19:00.347 --> 19:02.683
Let's go, Eun-seong.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.477
We're going home.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.897
-We're going to our home.
-"Our home"?

19:10.691 --> 19:12.651
Here we are.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.154
All right.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.782
-Shall we go inside?
-Yes.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.159
Come in.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.536
Mom, you come too.

19:22.744 --> 19:23.829
Wait.

19:23.912 --> 19:24.913
Ta-da.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.291
Gosh, is this our home?

19:27.374 --> 19:28.667
Yes. Do you like it?

19:29.918 --> 19:31.044
You have your own room too.

19:31.587 --> 19:32.921
-Where?
-Do you want to see it?

19:35.215 --> 19:36.258
Here it is.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.802
Mom, this is my room.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.138
Look at this.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.848
Cool.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.977
When did you prepare all this?

19:47.603 --> 19:49.646
It was so hard trying
to get it done quickly.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.899
We'll buy the rest slowly.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.527
This was the only decent place
near Ju-yeon's.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.321
Stay here even if you don't like it.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.240
We'll move somewhere nicer
when Eun-seong gets older.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.705
Why are you rushing everything?

20:08.999 --> 20:11.168
I want to live with you
as soon as possible.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.295
A married couple should live together.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.465
Don't you want to see the master bedroom?

20:18.592 --> 20:20.177
What are you doing?

20:24.264 --> 20:25.390
Do you like where the bed is?

20:26.975 --> 20:27.976
Do you not like it?

20:28.644 --> 20:29.770
Whatever.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.438
Come on. Sit down.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.773
You can lie down too.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.611
Are you angry that
I chose everything on my own?

20:38.654 --> 20:39.780
That's right.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.114
I'm angry.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.159
If you're angry, then let's lie down.
My gosh.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.794
Wait a second. Stop. That tickles.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.922
Hi, Eun-seong.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.841
Eun-seong, do something about him.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.392
Do you not like the furniture?

21:08.642 --> 21:10.978
Shall I return them?
You can choose what you like.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.689
I'm sure I'm a better judge though.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.023
You have tacky taste.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.234
I like it.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.735
Mister...

21:18.819 --> 21:19.945
Dad.

21:20.570 --> 21:23.865
I knew it. My daughter knows me the best.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.412
Can the kittens live with us?

21:28.620 --> 21:29.621
Of course.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.039
Yes!

21:36.545 --> 21:38.672
Mr. Park, let's talk.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.382
Yes, Chef.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.678
What happened?

21:45.470 --> 21:46.638
Tell me everything.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.390
About what?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.975
Why is Mr. Han quitting?

21:50.559 --> 21:52.894
Why did he quit right after being promoted
to executive director?

21:55.772 --> 21:57.482
That organ trafficking rumor is true,
isn't it?

21:58.734 --> 21:59.943
It is not.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.611
It's a false rumor.

22:01.695 --> 22:02.904
Then why did he quit?

22:04.740 --> 22:06.491
Was it for sexually harassing Hye-su?

22:06.575 --> 22:09.036
Gosh, I said that's not true.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.747
Why would he sexually harass Hye-su?

22:11.830 --> 22:13.707
He loves her to death.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.627
What? He loves her to death?

22:18.003 --> 22:20.130
Yes, that's right.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.716
He quit because he really likes her.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.677
What does liking her have to do
with him quitting?

22:26.678 --> 22:29.139
Well, the thing is...

22:29.639 --> 22:30.891
Did his family kick him out?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.436
HEART NAIL

22:34.561 --> 22:35.687
Seung-ju.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.857
Hi. Where's Eun-seong?

22:38.940 --> 22:40.650
She's sleeping. What's up?

22:41.109 --> 22:43.070
Nothing. I just thought of you
while passing by.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.447
I bought some snacks.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.782
Give them to Eun-seong.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.159
Thanks.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.244
Mr. Han quit

22:51.620 --> 22:53.288
because he got caught, didn't he?

22:54.664 --> 22:55.707
He quit?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.917
Didn't you know?

22:57.626 --> 22:59.086
He's quitting the restaurant.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.922
I heard he is leaving the company too.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.177
Are you okay?

23:09.429 --> 23:11.431
Yes, nothing's up with me.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.935
Hey, I'm sure nothing will happen.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.770
You didn't even get the surgery.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.189
I think he just quit on his own.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.191
That's my guess.

23:24.027 --> 23:25.195
He seems to be

23:25.779 --> 23:27.280
a decent guy these days.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.325
He must really like you.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.369
Good luck with him.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.455
I just wanted to give you two my blessing.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.958
Receive all the love

23:38.375 --> 23:39.751
you couldn't get from Seok-hwan.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.089
Thanks.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.715
No need.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.342
I'll get going then.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.220
Get home safely.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.812
How are the rumors?

23:59.855 --> 24:01.523
Are they quietening down?

24:02.232 --> 24:03.775
Yes, we've told the board members

24:03.859 --> 24:05.986
that Mr. Han was upset and
said those things

24:06.278 --> 24:09.531
in a fit of anger because
you disapproved of their relationship.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.866
Good thinking.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.869
Is the media quiet?

24:13.994 --> 24:15.287
No one called?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.622
-Actually...
-What?

24:17.873 --> 24:18.999
Did something happen?

24:19.291 --> 24:22.419
I believe that a reporter named
Hong Jin-seok has been contacting

24:22.502 --> 24:24.963
the secretaries to get information
about the company's situation.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.173
What?

24:26.256 --> 24:27.424
Who is that?

24:27.674 --> 24:28.800
It turns out that

24:28.884 --> 24:32.179
he's a reporter who is very close
to Mr. Han Jeong-hun.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.766
Why that brat...

24:38.226 --> 24:39.895
Call that reporter right now.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.272
I'll explain it to him myself.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.274
-Yes, sir.
-My goodness.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.367
-Hello, Dad.
-Get over here.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.705
What is it?

24:58.788 --> 24:59.873
Get over here!

24:59.956 --> 25:03.043
I left something upstairs, so...

25:06.713 --> 25:08.173
You want to die, don't you?

25:09.090 --> 25:10.842
What did I tell you?

25:11.301 --> 25:14.638
I said I wouldn't let it go
if you told anyone about this.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.640
What did I do?

25:16.723 --> 25:17.933
Like you don't know?

25:18.308 --> 25:20.268
Do you really want to take me on?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.519
Honey!

25:23.939 --> 25:25.106
You stay out of it.

25:25.815 --> 25:28.526
You have no right to speak
after raising your child like this.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.615
Pack your things and leave tomorrow
for the US office.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.492
I already processed the transfer.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.286
What? The US office?

25:38.370 --> 25:40.956
Yes. If I let you stay here,

25:41.706 --> 25:43.792
you'll destroy the company.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.337
Go there and live quietly.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.632
If you cause trouble there too,

25:51.174 --> 25:53.051
I'll disown you right away.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.179
I will not let you receive
any of my fortune.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.639
Dad.

25:58.223 --> 26:01.101
This is so unfair.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.771
-Unfair?
-Yes, it's unfair!

26:04.854 --> 26:06.356
What's so unfair?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.526
You brat.

26:09.859 --> 26:10.986
Gosh.

26:12.195 --> 26:13.321
Mom.

26:13.863 --> 26:17.200
It's so unfair, Mom.

26:17.742 --> 26:20.495
I don't want to live anymore.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.914
This is so unfair.

26:23.039 --> 26:25.166
I'm going crazy.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.425
Leave. I want to be alone.

26:35.593 --> 26:37.429
Didn't you hear me?

26:38.013 --> 26:39.097
Fine.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.348
Be alone.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.351
I'll let you be alone forever.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.187
If Jeong-hun leaves,

26:46.980 --> 26:48.273
I'll go with him.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.693
Live here by yourself

26:52.235 --> 26:53.695
for a very long time.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.581
Do you even know

27:05.081 --> 27:07.500
what's going on right now?

27:08.043 --> 27:10.795
Your business has nothing to do with me.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.673
You lived for your work all your life,

27:14.174 --> 27:16.134
and I took a backseat.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.179
Do you think I did that
because I was stupid?

27:19.929 --> 27:23.224
I expected it to get better
as we grew old.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.061
Since you'll grow old too.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.772
I thought you'd change.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.191
That's what I hoped for.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.068
But

27:33.735 --> 27:35.320
I was mistaken.

27:35.945 --> 27:37.364
I regret marrying you.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.076
I regret it so much.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.829
Do you know whose fault it is

27:45.246 --> 27:46.706
that Jeong-hun ended up that way?

27:47.791 --> 27:49.209
It's because

27:49.876 --> 27:53.630
he never saw you and I care
for each other.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.133
Can't you love him
even if he's not perfect?

27:57.592 --> 27:59.010
Isn't that what families do?

27:59.344 --> 28:01.096
Imagine how bad he must be
for me to act this way.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.098
Forget it.

28:03.556 --> 28:06.518
I'm sick of hearing the same excuse.

28:07.143 --> 28:09.771
Everyone envies me
for being married to a chairman.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.982
No one knows how cruddy my life is.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.072
Live a good life.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.282
I'm leaving.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.203
I'll come back

28:26.913 --> 28:28.164
once you're dead.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.863
You should buy something.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.449
Mother.

29:44.532 --> 29:45.617
Hello.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.952
The customers just left.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.829
My gosh. What brings you here?

29:50.079 --> 29:51.289
Have you had lunch?

29:52.415 --> 29:54.250
What? Lunch? No.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.252
I'll buy you something nice.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.922
Okay, let's go eat.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.674
My legs. My aching body.

30:03.676 --> 30:04.594
Gosh.

30:04.886 --> 30:05.720
Here.

30:07.597 --> 30:08.723
Try it.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.644
Try these vegetables.

30:12.811 --> 30:13.937
They're so good.

30:15.230 --> 30:19.192
It's been so long
since we ate together like this.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.863
I feel so much better now that I'm full.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.616
My legs hurt so much today.

30:29.619 --> 30:30.745
You must be tired.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.372
It's okay.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.750
Making a living is tiring for everyone.

30:37.752 --> 30:41.339
Look at you though. Why do you look worse?

30:41.923 --> 30:44.342
Why do you keep losing so much weight?

30:47.929 --> 30:49.180
Actually,

30:50.640 --> 30:52.559
I have something to tell you.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.768
What is it?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.816
Actually,

31:01.568 --> 31:02.694
I am

31:03.570 --> 31:05.071
a little sick.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.198
See?

31:07.407 --> 31:08.700
I knew it.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.159
I was right.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.787
Tell me. How are you sick?

31:13.162 --> 31:14.163
Stomach problems?

31:15.665 --> 31:16.791
No.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.130
Just in case...

31:24.173 --> 31:27.176
I end up leaving suddenly,

31:29.137 --> 31:31.681
I wanted to let you know.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.226
What do you mean?

31:55.538 --> 31:57.457
They tell me I won't live for much longer.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.420
If I do end up leaving,

32:04.756 --> 32:07.091
please look after Eun-seong for me.

32:10.428 --> 32:13.389
I think I'll feel most at peace

32:14.098 --> 32:15.308
asking you.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.324
I'm quite shameless,

32:32.784 --> 32:33.910
aren't I?

32:52.095 --> 32:53.638
Tell me everything.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.641
What's going on?

33:05.692 --> 33:06.859
Who told you?

33:07.610 --> 33:08.861
Your dad.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.822
He came to see me.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.369
I'm flabbergasted
the more I think about it.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.288
I'm flabbergasted because of you

33:19.998 --> 33:21.374
and her.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.503
I didn't want to believe it,

33:26.129 --> 33:27.547
so I didn't call you

33:27.839 --> 33:29.590
and sat here blankly all day.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.094
Is it true?

33:34.095 --> 33:35.847
Is she really that sick?

33:42.228 --> 33:43.396
I'm sorry

33:44.814 --> 33:46.399
for making things hard for you

33:46.524 --> 33:47.650
while you're still recovering.

33:49.610 --> 33:50.737
So?

33:52.196 --> 33:54.615
Do you plan to stay with her?

33:58.286 --> 33:59.287
Yes.

34:05.710 --> 34:06.711
Mom,

34:09.088 --> 34:11.340
I need your encouragement right now.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.969
I need all the encouragement
that I can get.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.388
So please

34:17.847 --> 34:19.474
don't try to stop me

34:20.308 --> 34:21.976
or state the obvious.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.316
Do you like her that much?

34:31.778 --> 34:32.945
Couldn't you tell?

34:34.655 --> 34:36.074
I know you knew.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.619
How much time does she have left?

34:48.336 --> 34:49.962
How can you ask that?

34:50.505 --> 34:51.714
You survived too.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.716
You almost died, but you lived.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.552
She's going to live too.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.181
She'll live with me forever.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.225
We'll grow old together,

35:02.809 --> 35:04.393
and I'll die one day before she does.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.822
I'm sorry, Ji-hun.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.158
I understand how you feel,

35:19.242 --> 35:21.077
but I can't support you.

35:23.204 --> 35:26.541
What mother would want to watch
her son carry a heap of hay

35:26.624 --> 35:28.626
into a pit of fire?

35:29.669 --> 35:33.714
Do you know how difficult
and painful it will be?

35:34.507 --> 35:36.050
Can you even imagine?

35:39.137 --> 35:40.680
I know you feel bad for her.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.724
I know she's a good person too.

35:44.767 --> 35:45.893
But still.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.687
Ji-hun.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.320
Don't worry.

35:57.613 --> 35:59.240
It's not a pit of fire.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.367
It's because I want to.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.716
My goodness.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.075
Hi, Hye-su.

36:43.993 --> 36:46.078
Do you want to have dinner
with us tonight?

36:48.247 --> 36:50.708
I owe my friend a lot,

36:52.376 --> 36:53.711
so I want to cook for her.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.882
Let's eat at her place.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.092
Are you inviting me over?

37:08.768 --> 37:10.603
Yes, I'm inviting you.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.065
What do you want to eat?

37:14.690 --> 37:16.275
You like kimchi stew and japchae.

37:17.276 --> 37:18.527
And you hate broccoli.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.489
I know your preferences.

37:24.283 --> 37:25.660
I studied a lot.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.663
Okay, I'll come over later.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.210
Who were you talking to
that you're all smiles?

37:34.418 --> 37:37.171
Hi, Uncle. I was on my way to see you.

37:37.880 --> 37:38.798
Gosh,

37:38.881 --> 37:41.926
I heard your dad still hasn't come
to his senses.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.514
I don't know what it is,

37:47.431 --> 37:50.393
but your family is a mess too.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.939
Goodness. Even if you're poor,

37:55.273 --> 37:57.191
it's better to be at peace.

37:58.484 --> 37:59.610
Bye.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.320
Goodbye.

38:02.488 --> 38:03.531
HANNAM FOOD

38:03.656 --> 38:05.825
Jeong-hun and his mother just left.

38:11.539 --> 38:12.623
Hello, Chairman Seo.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.502
It's nice out.

38:16.585 --> 38:17.837
Let's go golfing.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.257
If Na-yoon is free, maybe...

38:22.591 --> 38:23.801
I'll call you back.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.137
Hi, Na-yoon.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.389
I was actually going to call.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.640
I'm glad you're here.

38:29.932 --> 38:31.559
I wanted to tell you something.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.186
Sit down.
I have something to tell you too.

38:42.653 --> 38:43.863
Ji-hun will be

38:44.280 --> 38:46.699
returning to work soon.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.993
I sent him out

38:49.577 --> 38:52.413
to stay quiet until things calm down.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.206
And don't worry

38:55.166 --> 38:56.625
about that woman.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.254
Everything will be resolved soon.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.423
Sir,

39:04.008 --> 39:06.635
please don't link me and Ji-hun
together anymore.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.889
Whatever's going on with him
or that woman,

39:10.723 --> 39:12.058
I don't want to care about it anymore.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.686
I do not want to waste my life,

39:16.562 --> 39:18.314
waiting around in hopelessness.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.902
I'm not that big of a hopeless romantic.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.864
I think I should stop here

39:28.407 --> 39:30.826
so that I can at least cherish
my memories.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.082
-Mom.
-Yes?

40:18.374 --> 40:19.500
Can I eat this?

40:19.875 --> 40:21.544
Of course. You can eat all of it.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.924
Are we having a party today?

40:28.509 --> 40:29.927
Yes, we are.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.178
For what?

40:31.345 --> 40:33.973
We're having a party with Mister
and Auntie Ju-yeon.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.809
I'm showing off my cooking skills
for the first time in a while.

40:37.601 --> 40:40.896
I'm thankful to Mister.
I'm thankful to Auntie Ju-yeon.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.940
And I'm thankful to you too.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.985
That's why I want to treat you guys.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.028
Why are you thankful to me?

40:48.404 --> 40:51.240
I'm thankful that you are you.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.200
No...

41:01.125 --> 41:02.585
Mom, are you okay?

41:05.921 --> 41:07.339
Yes, I'm okay.

41:17.766 --> 41:18.893
Mom!

41:20.144 --> 41:21.270
Mom.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.147
Don't come near, Eun-seong!

41:24.064 --> 41:25.191
Don't come.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.775
-Mom.
-Stay there.

41:27.026 --> 41:28.152
Stay there!

41:28.903 --> 41:30.029
Go away, Eun-seong.

41:30.946 --> 41:32.072
Go over there.

41:33.699 --> 41:34.825
I'm sorry, Eun-seong.

41:35.868 --> 41:36.994
I'm sorry.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.371
I'm sorry, Eun-seong.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.581
It smells good.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.416
I'm sorry.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.252
What's wrong, Eun-seong?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.921
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.339
It's okay.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.174
Hye-su.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.345
Please take her.

41:57.139 --> 41:58.849
Please take her.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.434
Okay.

42:01.769 --> 42:05.481
Eun-seong, shall we wait outside
for a moment?

42:05.564 --> 42:07.650
I know. It's okay.

42:07.816 --> 42:08.943
Good girl.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.986
You're a good girl, Eun-seong.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.082
Mom is being weird.

42:23.332 --> 42:24.708
It's okay.

42:25.584 --> 42:26.710
Mom...

42:28.504 --> 42:30.422
is feeling a little dizzy.

42:31.006 --> 42:32.633
Why is she dizzy?

42:33.259 --> 42:34.718
Well...

42:35.678 --> 42:36.804
She must be carsick.

42:37.179 --> 42:38.847
You know what that is, right?

42:39.682 --> 42:41.267
She must have been in a car

42:41.934 --> 42:44.019
for too long today. Right?

43:25.102 --> 43:26.228
Eun-seong,

43:26.979 --> 43:29.106
can you stay by yourself for a minute?

43:30.024 --> 43:32.651
Let me go and help your mom a little bit.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.903
No. Let me go with you.

43:35.446 --> 43:38.866
It'll be for just one minute.

43:39.533 --> 43:40.659
Okay?

43:41.160 --> 43:44.830
Eun-seong, shall we play with nail polish?

43:45.331 --> 43:48.584
What color will you put on for me today?

43:48.792 --> 43:51.378
-Hello.
-Dad.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.255
What's wrong?

43:54.048 --> 43:55.341
-What is it?
-I think

43:56.091 --> 43:57.968
you should go inside.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.554
Hye-su needs some help.

44:02.389 --> 44:03.390
Dad.

44:03.474 --> 44:05.392
Yes, Eun-seong. Don't cry.

44:05.476 --> 44:06.602
Don't cry.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.985
Eun-seong, shall we go and see
the kittens?

44:15.277 --> 44:16.278
Yes?

44:48.769 --> 44:49.895
Hye-su.

45:16.755 --> 45:19.007
Stay right here. Don't move.

45:57.754 --> 45:59.214
It's a mess.

46:00.466 --> 46:01.967
Were you that excited to see your husband?

46:03.969 --> 46:05.095
I guess so.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.271
I'll clean up and set the table.

46:26.950 --> 46:29.161
I wanted to cook something nice for you.

46:31.872 --> 46:33.081
I'll eat it all.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.043
I'll eat it all, so don't worry.

46:44.218 --> 46:46.428
You should've come a little later.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.183
You should've come a little bit later.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.232
Shall I go back out?

47:44.278 --> 47:45.571
Ju-yeon!

47:47.197 --> 47:48.407
Hello.

47:48.490 --> 47:50.284
Hi, Eun-seong.

47:50.492 --> 47:53.662
Eun-seong, do you want to go upstairs
to see the kittens?

47:54.788 --> 47:55.789
Okay.

47:56.331 --> 47:57.457
Go on.

47:58.834 --> 47:59.960
Oh, my.

48:00.294 --> 48:02.629
It's been so long after Hye-su quit.

48:02.838 --> 48:03.922
Gosh.

48:04.089 --> 48:06.008
You're even more beautiful today.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.051
Have you eaten?

48:08.510 --> 48:09.511
Not yet.

48:09.595 --> 48:12.514
Why haven't you eaten yet?

48:12.598 --> 48:14.474
You must be so hungry.

48:15.684 --> 48:18.937
Then give me something delicious to eat.

48:19.021 --> 48:21.189
-Really?
-Eun-seong will be hungry too.

48:21.607 --> 48:22.983
Eun-seong!

48:23.233 --> 48:25.277
Come down when you're done playing
with the kittens!

48:25.360 --> 48:26.945
Mr. Park here said that

48:27.029 --> 48:30.198
he'll buy us delicious steak!

48:30.282 --> 48:31.491
-Okay.
-Steak...

48:31.700 --> 48:32.868
Steak?

48:35.370 --> 48:36.413
Sure.

48:36.496 --> 48:37.998
Steak.

48:38.081 --> 48:40.125
I like mine medium well-done.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.418
I don't like any blood.

48:43.211 --> 48:44.463
You're just like me.

48:44.546 --> 48:45.839
I hate blood too.

48:47.549 --> 48:50.510
Blackie, Chubby, and Cutie.

49:12.366 --> 49:14.076
We'll be back after dinner.

49:14.159 --> 49:15.494
Enjoy a hot night.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.458
Eun-seong is going to eat out.

49:22.709 --> 49:23.835
I saw.

49:26.755 --> 49:29.675
I'm starting to get hot already.

49:29.758 --> 49:30.926
Oh, my gosh.

49:33.095 --> 49:34.680
Let me try this.

49:37.474 --> 49:38.600
How is it?

49:38.975 --> 49:40.102
My goodness.

49:43.271 --> 49:44.523
You really are a chef.

49:44.815 --> 49:45.941
-Do you mean it?
-Yes.

49:46.191 --> 49:47.317
I do.

49:49.069 --> 49:50.070
Thank you.

49:50.821 --> 49:51.947
For what?

49:53.824 --> 49:55.075
I have something to say.

49:57.953 --> 49:59.413
I said I have something to say.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.295
Promise me that once I'm gone,

50:10.716 --> 50:13.135
you'll go back to where you belong.

50:16.304 --> 50:18.932
I'll be a good wife until then.

50:31.319 --> 50:32.446
-Hye-su.
-Wait.

50:33.947 --> 50:35.866
As for Eun-seong,

50:37.826 --> 50:41.288
could you see her once every so often
and look after her?

50:42.414 --> 50:44.249
That's what I feel the worst about.

50:47.085 --> 50:48.879
I want you to do that for her.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.388
Are you kidding with me right now?

51:02.017 --> 51:03.351
Who said you could leave?

51:03.894 --> 51:05.145
And go where?

51:05.353 --> 51:06.605
Why are you being like that?

51:13.528 --> 51:14.738
Take it all back.

51:18.617 --> 51:19.743
Take it back.

51:30.378 --> 51:32.255
Okay, I take it back.

51:36.468 --> 51:37.844
I take it all back.

51:43.767 --> 51:45.519
I'm sorry, but I'd like to lie down.

51:47.562 --> 51:48.688
I'm dizzy.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.291
I'm going to sleep.

52:10.544 --> 52:11.878
Leave once you're done with your meal.

52:20.804 --> 52:22.848
Okay. Fine.

52:23.890 --> 52:25.392
Continue being pathetic.

52:27.602 --> 52:29.855
Leave if you want to. Whatever.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.598
I'm eating
because I don't want to waste it.

53:28.496 --> 53:29.748
At least it tastes good.

54:48.994 --> 54:52.038
MOTHER

54:53.289 --> 54:54.499
Hello, Mother.

54:56.209 --> 54:58.920
Listen carefully.

55:00.296 --> 55:01.423
You don't think

55:01.840 --> 55:03.842
you're going to die, do you?

55:09.264 --> 55:10.849
This is insane.

55:14.728 --> 55:17.856
I'll pretend I didn't hear
what you said earlier.

55:18.940 --> 55:19.858
I...

55:21.401 --> 55:22.861
I already lost my son.

55:24.696 --> 55:26.698
And I won't lose my daughter-in-law.

55:28.742 --> 55:31.369
Be strong and live.

55:33.747 --> 55:34.873
You must live.

55:35.749 --> 55:37.083
Think of Eun-seong,

55:38.168 --> 55:39.878
and do whatever it takes to live.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.130
Do you understand?

55:46.259 --> 55:47.385
Yes, Mother.

55:51.347 --> 55:52.557
I'll live.

55:55.268 --> 55:56.895
I promise I'll live.

57:11.803 --> 57:13.596
Ji-hun!

57:13.721 --> 57:15.974
Last night, Ju-yeon...

57:16.349 --> 57:17.350
Hey.

57:18.226 --> 57:19.436
Hey.

57:19.519 --> 57:20.770
What's wrong?

57:24.858 --> 57:27.318
Ho-jun, I have a favor to ask.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.196
I'm going to propose.

57:30.780 --> 57:31.865
I need your help.

57:31.948 --> 57:33.575
My gosh.

57:34.033 --> 57:35.160
Propose?

57:35.410 --> 57:36.703
To whom?

57:36.870 --> 57:38.037
To Hye-su?

57:38.288 --> 57:39.539
Who else would it be?

57:41.166 --> 57:42.417
Can you play the guitar?

57:42.709 --> 57:44.544
No, I can't play the guitar.

57:44.794 --> 57:48.756
I can play that one song called
"A Love That Cannot Come True."

57:52.385 --> 57:53.928
I will do my best.

57:54.012 --> 57:55.096
I'll do my best.

58:12.906 --> 58:14.908
The couch is being delivered
to our new home today.

58:15.366 --> 58:17.076
Come and see if you like it.

58:17.494 --> 58:18.661
I'll see you at five o'clock.

58:29.923 --> 58:31.799
Where are you going?

58:32.300 --> 58:34.135
Are you going on a date?

58:34.761 --> 58:35.887
No.

58:36.471 --> 58:38.932
He asked me to look at some furniture.

58:40.683 --> 58:43.144
Hye-su, you should enjoy it.

58:43.228 --> 58:44.646
What's the big deal?

58:46.022 --> 58:48.358
You're allowed to.

58:48.650 --> 58:50.777
Why not? Right?

58:52.070 --> 58:53.196
Thanks.

58:53.613 --> 58:55.073
I'll be right back.

58:56.616 --> 58:57.992
Be careful.

58:58.660 --> 58:59.994
Enjoy your date.

59:04.958 --> 59:06.709
HYE-SU, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

59:12.549 --> 59:13.675
Isn't it pretty?

59:14.050 --> 59:18.388
It is the love

59:18.972 --> 59:21.474
That cannot be

59:22.058 --> 59:23.184
Are you crazy?

59:23.309 --> 59:25.186
What? You don't like it?

59:30.024 --> 59:31.276
Whereabouts are you?

59:34.862 --> 59:38.658
I'M ON MY WAY

59:49.210 --> 59:50.461
I'm on my way.

59:54.299 --> 59:56.718
Eun-seong, watch.

59:56.843 --> 59:59.345
You stand there, holding the bouquet.

59:59.762 --> 1:00:03.266
Mister will walk out here.

1:00:03.558 --> 1:00:07.562
Then you run out and give him the bouquet.

1:00:08.229 --> 1:00:10.898
Get on your knee. And now it's your turn.

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:13.568
Please...

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:16.362
Come on! Tell her you love her.

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:23.494
I can't do this. It's making me cringe.

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:26.122
This was your idea.

1:00:26.372 --> 1:00:27.540
I can't do it.

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:28.750
Goodness.

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:31.336
You're the one who wanted to do this.

1:00:32.003 --> 1:00:32.962
Goodness.

1:00:33.046 --> 1:00:34.297
In that case...

1:00:34.714 --> 1:00:36.716
The proposal song.

1:00:37.050 --> 1:00:38.176
Sing.

1:00:43.973 --> 1:00:45.850
Sing the proposal song.

1:00:45.933 --> 1:00:47.935
Okay, ready?

1:00:50.688 --> 1:00:51.898
I can't.

1:00:52.482 --> 1:00:53.941
It's awkward.

1:00:54.609 --> 1:00:56.402
I don't think I can do this.

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:57.528
Must I do this?

1:00:57.612 --> 1:00:59.030
These are the basics.

1:00:59.113 --> 1:01:00.782
Everyone does it like this nowadays.

1:01:00.865 --> 1:01:02.283
Forget it.

1:01:02.367 --> 1:01:03.368
It's so childish.

1:01:03.451 --> 1:01:04.744
My goodness.

1:01:04.952 --> 1:01:07.789
What happened to the kid
who wanted to pursue a career in music?

1:01:07.872 --> 1:01:09.791
I didn't sing though.

1:01:10.083 --> 1:01:12.001
Dad, shall I sing, then?

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:13.795
Yes. You sing.

1:01:13.878 --> 1:01:17.799
Really? Then let's go! Ready?

1:03:09.869 --> 1:03:11.996
