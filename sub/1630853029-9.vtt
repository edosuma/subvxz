10:24.885 --> 10:27.627
- Yeah, I took a selfie
and posted it during dinner.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.933
- Ella was wearing
a diamond necklace.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.761
- Yes, beautiful.
[chuckles]

10:31.805 --> 10:34.242
- Reason I ask is
she wasn't wearing it

10:34.285 --> 10:37.375
when we found the body.
Just to confirm--

10:37.419 --> 10:39.769
she didn't take it off
for some reason?

10:39.813 --> 10:43.773
- Was she dating anyone?
- Uh...I'm not sure. Ha.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.080
Like I said, we met
a couple weeks ago, so...

10:46.123 --> 10:49.474
Well, it turns out
we did use the same matchmaker.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.259
- Matchmaker?
- Yeah.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.869
Yeah, her name's Tiffany.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.178
- I know lots of wealthy men

10:57.221 --> 10:59.441
and lots of young,
beautiful women,

10:59.484 --> 11:01.704
so I figured I might as well
find a way to monetize it.

11:01.748 --> 11:06.056
- So these people
pay you to set up dates.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.710
- The men pay me an annual fee.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.060
In exchange,
I send photos and resumes

11:10.104 --> 11:11.801
of my female acquaintances.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.282
If they're interested
in someone, I introduce them.

11:14.325 --> 11:15.718
- Okay.

11:15.762 --> 11:19.983
I'm guessing you
don't accept cops as clients.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.158
- [laughs]

11:21.202 --> 11:23.204
Only if you're worth
over 200 million.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.512
- Oh.
- What about Ella?

11:27.556 --> 11:29.210
- Thought she was
a great catch.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.952
Attractive, fun, full of life.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.694
- Did you introduce her to
any of your clients recently?

11:34.737 --> 11:36.130
- I've introduced her
to several.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.609
Some she liked,
some she didn't,

11:37.653 --> 11:40.874
but just last month
she met someone really special.

11:40.917 --> 11:44.138
Comes from a prestigious,
old-line family just like Ella.

11:44.181 --> 11:47.924
I was really optimistic
they'd hit it off, you know?

11:47.968 --> 11:50.971
It's much easier for people
from that type of wealth

11:51.014 --> 11:53.277
to relate to one another.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.722
- Excuse me. Wyatt Ackman?

12:02.765 --> 12:05.376
You mind if we ask you
a few questions?

12:05.420 --> 12:08.379
- About what?
- Ella Whitlock.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.860
- Did something happen to her?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.906
- I'm afraid so.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.951
She's dead.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.998
- Sorry for your loss.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.217
- Seems as if she got
into a little altercation

12:20.261 --> 12:23.568
at her nightclub downtown.
- Ohh...

12:23.612 --> 12:25.570
- You two were dating, correct?

12:25.614 --> 12:28.443
- Y-yeah, yes, yes.
So-sort of.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.053
- Were you two having
any issues?

12:30.097 --> 12:31.402
- No.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.448
- When was the last time
that you talked to her?

12:33.491 --> 12:36.756
- Yesterday.
Briefly over the phone.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.236
- And what did you talk about?
- The club.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.762
She couldn't wait to finish it.
Turn her dream into a reality.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.373
- More like a reality
into a dream.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.027
- What do you mean?
- Did you know

12:47.070 --> 12:48.942
that she was living
under an assumed identity?

12:48.985 --> 12:51.248
- And that she was
dead-ass broke?

12:51.292 --> 12:53.381
Didn't go to college,

12:53.424 --> 12:55.339
didn't have two nickels
to rub together,

12:55.383 --> 12:58.342
and her real name
was Mary Costello.

12:58.386 --> 13:03.173
- I...I had no idea.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.914
- If you don't mind me asking,

13:04.958 --> 13:08.526
what were you doing last night?
- Excuse me?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.572
- You know, the more people
we rule out, the better.

13:10.615 --> 13:13.923
- Oh, I-I see. Sure. Um...

13:13.967 --> 13:18.232
I was home for most of
the night working, watching TV,

13:18.275 --> 13:20.408
went out for a walk.
- Mm.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.367
- You can check with
my doorman.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.369
- Oh, we will.

13:26.675 --> 13:29.939
- Oh, did Ella
ever use Bluetooth

13:29.983 --> 13:32.289
or charge her phone
in your vehicle?

13:32.333 --> 13:34.901
- It's possible. Why?

13:34.944 --> 13:36.206
- It worked.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.860
When she synced her phone
in Ackman's Maybach,

13:37.904 --> 13:39.427
it stored
all of her personal data.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.429
So we have
all of her texts, emails.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.866
- Oh, you keep
surprising me, Frank.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.607
- I don't sell shoes
for a living.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.348
- Anything interesting?

13:47.391 --> 13:50.003
- Lots of complaints
from creditors,

13:50.046 --> 13:51.743
investors, contractors,

13:51.787 --> 13:53.789
but there was one guy
who was really aggressive.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.877
I mean, he wasn't just whining,

13:54.921 --> 13:57.488
he was firing off
legit threats.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.794
"Done playing with you, girl.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.491
Like for real.
I want my money."

14:00.535 --> 14:02.102
That was sent three days ago.
- Mm-hmm.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.234
And then the next day,
he sends this.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.671
"I better see you tonight,
or this ain't gonna end well.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.717
I promise."
- You got a name?

14:08.760 --> 14:11.763
- Yeah, Matthew Dooley.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.896
And it just keeps
getting better.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.813
He was arrested five months ago
for aggravated battery.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.642
- Let's find Mr. Dooley
right away.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.039
.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.868
- I went on a trip with her
to Istanbul.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.608
I was supposed to be her guest,

14:30.652 --> 14:33.046
but I ended up
getting stuck with the tab.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.570
I had to put it on
three credit cards.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.224
Dropped 48 grand.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.096
So yeah, I was pissed.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.012
- When was the last time
you saw Ella?

14:43.056 --> 14:45.058
- Two nights ago.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.016
She stopped by the bar
around 11:00 or so.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.062
Said she was gonna
pay me back real soon,

14:49.105 --> 14:51.412
but there was a problem
with her trust fund.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.588
Needed her trustee
to authorize the transfer,

14:53.631 --> 14:56.025
but he was in Prague.
It was all a bunch of crap.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.244
I knew she was a fraud,

14:57.287 --> 14:58.898
so I just told her
to get the hell out.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.509
- How did you know
she was a fraud?

15:01.552 --> 15:04.381
- She used the word jughandle
once to describe an offramp.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.383
You know, like
when you're on a highway.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.429
That's something
people from Jersey say,

15:08.472 --> 15:11.171
not people from Park Avenue.
- Hmm.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.999
- So I did some digging.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.826
I ran a reverse image search,
and I found

15:14.870 --> 15:17.351
a yearbook photo of her with
the name Mary Costello.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.179
- How'd that make you feel?

15:19.222 --> 15:22.269
- Like an idiot...
but I didn't kill her.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.575
- We're gonna need
a little more than that.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.970
- I was here working
till 3:00 a.m.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.973
Check the video.
- Oh, we will.

15:31.017 --> 15:35.456
- Can you think of anyone else
that Ella screwed over?

15:35.499 --> 15:38.198
- She said some Mexican guy
loaned her some money,

15:38.241 --> 15:39.764
but he wanted
to get paid back right away.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.636
He was threatening
all kinds of scary stuff.

15:41.679 --> 15:44.334
Like, real scary.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.989
She said his family was
connected to a drug cartel too.

15:47.859 --> 15:51.646
- Yeah, we talked to
the big, bad Mexican dude.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.909
Turns out he's just like
everybody else in that crowd.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.302
A poser.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.130
Father is a high school
science teacher.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.435
Said he was
only threatening Ella

15:58.479 --> 16:00.481
so she could pay him
his money back.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.178
- It worked too.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.919
She went over to his apartment
two nights ago around midnight,

16:03.963 --> 16:07.270
gave him 50 grand in cash.
- Is he telling the truth?

16:07.314 --> 16:09.316
- Hey, I've been pulling
traffic cam video

16:09.359 --> 16:10.882
outside this guy's
apartment building.

16:10.926 --> 16:14.495
Found footage of Ella hopping
into a cab at 12:07 a.m.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.888
I tried to track down
where it was headed, but...

16:16.932 --> 16:18.151
- It's okay.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.196
We'll just track down
the cabbie instead.

16:23.939 --> 16:26.550
- She's cute, but I still
don't remember picking her up.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.595
- Two nights ago,

16:27.638 --> 16:29.466
Upper East Side
around midnight.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.164
- I drive lots of people, bro.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.339
I never even
look at their faces.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.775
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't.

16:33.818 --> 16:36.343
Plexiglass is too thick.
I can barely see through it.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.388
- We spoke to your boss,

16:38.432 --> 16:41.391
and he was kind enough
to give us your GPS data.

16:41.435 --> 16:47.223
Picked her up at
919 First Avenue around 12:07,

16:47.267 --> 16:50.139
then you took her down
to the Lower East Side.

16:50.183 --> 16:53.447
841 Henry Street, to be exact.
- So?

16:53.490 --> 16:56.319
- So she ended up murdered
at that exact address

16:56.363 --> 16:59.192
not long after
you dropped her off.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.063
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.891
You're sayin' you thinking I--
- No, we're not saying

17:02.934 --> 17:05.067
a damn thing--we're just
asking you questions.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.416
- We just want to know
what happened

17:06.460 --> 17:08.636
after you dropped her off.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.203
- I know who
you're talking about,

17:10.246 --> 17:13.249
but nothing weird happened.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.990
I took her down
to the warehouse.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.079
She paid me, and that was that.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.081
Gave me a big tip too.
50 bucks.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.170
- And then what,
you just drove off?

17:21.214 --> 17:23.042
- Not right away.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.653
It's kinda creepy down there,
so I watched her go inside.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.350
Just wanted to make sure
nothing bad happened.

17:27.394 --> 17:31.528
- Was anyone around?
See some homeless dudes, cars?

17:31.572 --> 17:33.182
- Yeah.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.750
Yeah, there was a car
parked across the street.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.230
A nice one too.

17:37.273 --> 17:40.146
I think it was a Maybach.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.235
- This is a mistake!

17:42.278 --> 17:44.237
I didn't kill her, I swear!

17:44.280 --> 17:47.544
I was just--
- You were what? Huh?

17:47.588 --> 17:49.285
We already talked
to your driver, Wyatt.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.592
He puts you at the scene
at the time of the murder.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.550
- But if you want to tell us
your side of the story,

17:53.594 --> 17:55.770
we'd be happy to listen.
- There is no my side.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.251
I already told you,
I didn't kill Ella.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.427
I loved her.
Why would I want to hurt her?

18:00.470 --> 18:01.776
- Because you found out
her name was Mary.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.082
- The bartender Dooley

18:03.125 --> 18:05.127
sent you a text
telling you she was a fraud.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.260
- She played you
like a punk, Wyatt.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.957
So you beat her up
and threw her off a balcony.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.350
- No. I...

18:12.439 --> 18:15.572
I'm done talking.
I want a lawyer.

18:16.312 --> 18:20.360
- Lawyer? No.
You're gonna need a priest.

18:25.800 --> 18:25.974
.

18:26.017 --> 18:29.412
- Docket number CR20097-82.

18:29.456 --> 18:30.848
People v Wyatt Ackman.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.546
Charging murder
in the second-degree.

18:32.589 --> 18:35.592
- My client pleads not guilty.
- I'll hear the people on bail.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.943
- The defendant argued
and fought with his girlfriend

18:38.987 --> 18:41.555
then pushed his girlfriend
off a balcony.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.948
She fell 40 feet
and died instantly.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.864
Rather than calling 911,
the defendant fled,

18:46.908 --> 18:48.562
but not before removing

18:48.605 --> 18:51.130
a $200,000 necklace
from her person.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.262
A necklace
he had just given her.

18:53.306 --> 18:56.004
While Mr. Ackman
has no criminal record,

18:56.047 --> 18:59.181
he is heir to a $2 billion
pharmaceutical fortune

18:59.225 --> 19:02.489
and is therefore a flight risk.
People seek remand.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.578
- Ms. Greenough.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.145
- Your Honor,

19:06.188 --> 19:09.191
Mr. Ackman is battling
a severe opioid addiction.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.933
He's been receiving treatment
for this disease

19:11.976 --> 19:13.587
off and on
for the past two years.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.066
- Let's cut to the chase.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.808
You're asking me
to send him to rehab?

19:17.852 --> 19:19.462
- An inpatient
treatment facility.

19:19.506 --> 19:23.249
- Your Honor, he can detox
at Rikers like everyone else.

19:23.292 --> 19:27.078
- I agree.
The defendant is remanded.

19:28.515 --> 19:31.039
- The defense wants to use
settled insanity defense.

19:31.082 --> 19:34.042
- What the hell is that?
- A legal concept.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.000
As far as I know, it's never
been used in New York.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.002
- What's the theory?

19:38.046 --> 19:40.179
- It's a variation
of not guilty

19:40.222 --> 19:42.311
by reason of mental disease
or defect.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.617
And the basic idea is

19:43.660 --> 19:46.054
the defendant's
drug addiction is so severe,

19:46.097 --> 19:47.882
he or she can't form
the requisite intent

19:47.925 --> 19:49.144
to commit murder.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.146
- So he's looking for
a clever defense.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.452
Is that it?
- Yeah.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.018
He's trying to hide behind
his addiction.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.498
It's like killing your parents

19:55.542 --> 19:57.979
then begging for mercy
because you're an orphan.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.199
- File a motion to preclude
any evidence on the topic

20:00.242 --> 20:02.766
and in the meantime,
let's find out the nature

20:02.810 --> 20:04.812
and extent of
Mr. Ackman's drug use.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.729
[dramatic sting]

20:08.772 --> 20:10.296
- Wyatt Ackman had it bad.

20:10.339 --> 20:13.603
- When did he come here
for treatment?

20:13.647 --> 20:17.564
- First time, 18 months ago.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.783
Tried to go straight
on his own, bare knuckle it,

20:19.827 --> 20:21.350
but he was hurting.

20:22.830 --> 20:26.921
Shaking, vomiting,
chills, body aches.

20:26.964 --> 20:30.403
Chronic use like Wyatt's
alters the brain chemistry.

20:30.446 --> 20:33.232
Wreaks havoc on
the central nervous system.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.365
- How many times has
he been to this facility?

20:36.409 --> 20:38.672
- Three.

20:38.715 --> 20:41.327
Took me four.

20:41.370 --> 20:44.199
Destroyed my life
in the process, of course.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.768
Lost my wife and my career,
but I got clean.

20:48.638 --> 20:51.250
- When was the last time
you saw Wyatt Ackerman?

20:51.293 --> 20:54.862
- The day before the murder.
We met for coffee.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.646
- How did he appear?

20:56.690 --> 20:58.735
- Seemed to be doing great.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.781
Said he hadn't used in 64 days.

21:00.824 --> 21:03.131
- He say anything else?
- Yeah.

21:03.174 --> 21:05.089
Ella.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.483
Said he was
gonna propose to her.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.486
He was madly in love with her.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.751
[dramatic chords]

21:15.491 --> 21:17.798
- There's no evidence
this murder

21:17.841 --> 21:21.018
is even remotely connected
to the defendant's addiction.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.586
The defendant's
own treatment counselor

21:23.630 --> 21:26.415
will testify he was sober
around the time of the murder.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.287
- Just because he said
he was sober

21:28.330 --> 21:30.289
or appeared sober
to a treatment counselor

21:30.332 --> 21:31.768
doesn't mean he actually was.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.118
Moreover,
the settled insanity defense

21:34.162 --> 21:35.990
speaks to long-term drug use.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.731
Like I said,
it's a simple concept...

21:37.774 --> 21:39.123
- It's a simple concept,

21:39.167 --> 21:41.387
but that doesn't mean
it makes sense.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.736
- Excuse me?

21:42.779 --> 21:45.216
- Treating drug addiction
as a form of insanity

21:45.260 --> 21:50.265
is too big a stretch for me.
Your motion is denied.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.702
Are all parties
ready to impanel?

21:52.746 --> 21:56.315
- Actually, I'd like to discuss
a plea with the prosecution.

21:56.358 --> 21:59.013
- Even better.

21:59.056 --> 22:02.146
- We'd be willing to plead
to Man One. 15 years.

22:03.409 --> 22:07.326
That's not all.
We have a recording.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.632
A phone call between my client,

22:09.676 --> 22:11.982
the former chief operating
officer of Northwestern Pharma,

22:12.026 --> 22:13.375
and his uncle Charles Ackman,

22:13.419 --> 22:15.943
the founder and CEO
of Northwestern Pharma.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.689
- People die in cars
every day.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.212
Doesn't mean they're gonna
stop making them.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.083
- But you've seen the study.

22:26.127 --> 22:27.998
Our own scientists
are warning us

22:28.042 --> 22:30.000
that oxycodone
is up there with heroin.

22:30.044 --> 22:32.568
They say it penetrates the
pleasure centers in the brain

22:32.612 --> 22:35.049
seven times faster
and more efficiently

22:35.092 --> 22:37.660
than other opioids,
and with prolonged use,

22:37.704 --> 22:39.662
the pain relieving effect
diminished

22:39.706 --> 22:43.362
and pain can intensify.
The body may become dependent.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.364
This leads to
symptoms of withdrawal

22:45.407 --> 22:48.279
which makes it
extremely difficult to stop.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.151
We're killing people.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.675
- No, they're killing
themselves.

22:52.719 --> 22:56.287
We just happen to be the ones
getting rich from it.

22:58.551 --> 23:02.032
- There's more too.
A lot more.

23:02.076 --> 23:05.340
Conversation took place
five years ago.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.299
Not only did Uncle Charles
continue to produce the drug,

23:08.343 --> 23:11.128
he predicated his company's
entire marketing strategy

23:11.172 --> 23:13.696
and business plan
on getting people addicted.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.219
- That's horrific.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.526
- But what does it have to do
with the murder case?

23:17.570 --> 23:20.007
- My client can help you
bring a criminal fraud case

23:20.050 --> 23:22.226
against Charles Ackman
and his corporation.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.750
- He's killing people
every day.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.534
Every single day.

23:25.578 --> 23:29.364
- If you're so outraged,
why didn't you speak up sooner?

23:29.408 --> 23:32.062
Why'd it take a murder charge
for you to see the light?

23:32.106 --> 23:35.718
- My treatment counselor
relapsed.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.807
- What?

23:37.851 --> 23:40.027
- He overdosed last night.

23:40.070 --> 23:42.029
Died early this morning.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.987
- I just talked to him
yesterday.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.729
He seemed fine.

23:46.773 --> 23:52.431
- I just want to end
all the pain and suffering...

23:52.474 --> 23:54.258
and hold my uncle accountable

23:54.302 --> 23:56.435
for destroying
so many families.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.743
- Our murder case
against Wyatt Ackman

24:00.787 --> 24:03.006
is filled with holes.
There's no eyewitness.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.661
And let's not forget, we have
a less-than-perfect victim.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.315
- You're right,
she wasn't perfect,

24:07.358 --> 24:08.577
but she's still dead.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.144
- Oh, I understand,
but she conned him.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.754
His emotions were running high,

24:11.798 --> 24:14.627
which means he might have
a viable EED defense.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.499
- He's a rich brat who'll do
anything to save his own ass,

24:17.543 --> 24:19.806
including selling out
his own uncle.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.242
I think we should
reject the plea.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.462
- But if we move forward
on murder,

24:23.505 --> 24:25.942
there's a good chance we end
at manslaughter anyway.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.335
Why not take the plea

24:27.378 --> 24:29.903
and use Wyatt to build a case
against his uncle?

24:29.946 --> 24:33.254
- Because it's beyond
the scope of our jurisdiction.

24:33.297 --> 24:35.125
- He's a drug trafficker, Jack.

24:35.169 --> 24:37.737
He's knowingly
selling and marketing

24:37.780 --> 24:39.869
a highly addictive
and lethal product.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.958
If he were a heroin dealer,
we wouldn't think twice.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.091
- But he's not.

24:44.134 --> 24:47.224
He's the CEO of
a publicly traded company

24:47.268 --> 24:50.967
and the highly addictive
product he sells is legal.

24:51.011 --> 24:52.447
We're not the FDA, Nolan.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.145
It's not our job
to evaluate drugs.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.669
- But it's our job to prosecute

24:56.712 --> 24:59.454
a CEO who's been
defrauding the public.

24:59.498 --> 25:03.197
Who's been withholding crucial
information about oxycodone

25:03.240 --> 25:05.982
while incentivizing doctors
to over-prescribe it.

25:06.026 --> 25:09.638
- Let Congress or the
Justice Department handle it.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.946
- People are dying.

25:12.989 --> 25:16.427
Last year alone,
over 75,000 people

25:16.471 --> 25:20.040
died from opioid overdoses,

25:20.083 --> 25:22.564
but we have
a real opportunity here.

25:22.608 --> 25:27.308
If we take down Charles Ackman,
if we expose what he knows,

25:27.351 --> 25:31.225
we will literally save
hundreds of thousands of lives.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.667
- Okay.

25:38.711 --> 25:41.148
Take the plea.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.280
And bring an enterprise
corruption case

25:43.324 --> 25:45.413
against the uncle.

25:45.456 --> 25:49.765
- To hell with corruption.
If we're gonna do this,

about seven years ago.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.762
He was an accomplished
physician in his own right.

- What brought him
to your clinic?

27:58.241 --> 28:00.766
- He'd been in a car accident.
He was experiencing

28:00.809 --> 28:02.376
excruciating pain
in his back and neck.

28:02.419 --> 28:05.988
- And you prescribed oxycodone.
- Yes.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.990

28:08.034 --> 28:10.776
manufactured
by Northwestern Pharma?

28:12.429 --> 28:14.214
as the best medication
on the market.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.433

any incentives

28:16.477 --> 28:18.131

for speaking fees

28:21.612 --> 28:23.136
and consulting services.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.661
- Did you do any actual

- No, I'm not aware
of that statistic.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.005

marketed a product

35:38.048 --> 35:40.573

about the addictive qualities
of these pills, didn't they?

35:48.494 --> 35:51.149

percentage of the population

35:51.192 --> 35:53.020

to these drugs

35:53.063 --> 35:56.197

of them would overdose and die.

the medication because

These pills are legal.
They're FDA approved.

choose to abuse them

unaware of the risks.

someone and get away with it.

36:36.281 --> 36:39.240

personal circumstances

36:39.284 --> 36:42.112

to be fair and impartial.
