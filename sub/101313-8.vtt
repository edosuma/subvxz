06:15.249 --> 06:16.709
<i>In fact, from now on,</i>

06:16.793 --> 06:18.795
<i>think of me as your human shield.</i>

06:18.878 --> 06:21.297
<i>Or "Devil shield," rather.</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:22.632

<i>Lucifer, no.</i>

06:23.633 --> 06:24.509
<i>Listen.</i>

06:24.592 --> 06:27.095
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about the Whisper Killer case.</i>

06:27.178 --> 06:28.304
<i>Something isn't adding up.</i>

06:28.846 --> 06:32.266
<i>-But Klumpsky confessed to everything.</i>
<i>-Yes, but something is off.</i>

06:32.350 --> 06:34.977

<i>for someone they know,</i>

06:35.061 --> 06:36.646
<i>and then branch out to strangers.</i>

06:36.729 --> 06:40.024
<i>Klumpsky had no connection to</i>
<i>the first three victims, only the fourth.</i>

06:40.108 --> 06:41.818
<i>So it doesn't make sense.</i>

06:43.569 --> 06:46.322

<i>we could talk to.</i>

06:47.990 --> 06:49.283

<i>"The Husher."</i>

07:14.600 --> 07:16.561
<i>"The Shusher."</i>

<i>Ha.</i>

07:55.600 --> 07:56.434

07:57.435 --> 07:59.937
<i>Well, I followed her home one night.</i>

08:00.313 --> 08:04.150
<i>San Antonio is a nice town for stalking.</i>

08:04.233 --> 08:05.651

08:06.068 --> 08:07.320
<i>I'm sorry, it was Phoenix.</i>

08:07.403 --> 08:10.072
<i>Um, Olivia was in Phoenix, right?</i>

08:11.073 --> 08:12.200
<i>Right, yes.</i>

08:23.669 --> 08:25.880
<i>Uh, please ignore my partner,</i>
<i>and back to Olivia.</i>

08:25.963 --> 08:27.507
<i>Why did you move her body?</i>

08:37.683 --> 08:38.726

<i>not Olivia.</i>

<i>Agreed. He was completely useless</i>
<i>in my brainstorming session.</i>

09:06.587 --> 09:09.257
<i>Well, what I mean is I don't think</i>
<i>he killed the first three victims.</i>

09:09.340 --> 09:10.174
<i>So?</i>

09:10.258 --> 09:13.219
<i>He clearly killed that schoolteacher</i>
<i>Madison, and he took a swing at you.</i>

09:13.302 --> 09:16.055
<i>He belongs in prison, then Hell.</i>

<i>[Chloe] </i>Lucifer, I was right.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.296
<i>Klumpsky didn't kill the first three.</i>

11:12.755 --> 11:15.841
<i>There's another serial killer,</i>
<i>and he's still out there.</i>

11:15.925 --> 11:20.513
<i>Listen, I got a lead, tomorrow,</i>
<i>in the Arts District, so--</i> [screams]

11:22.431 --> 11:24.266
<i>[struggling sounds on phone]</i>

<i>[crashing sounds on phone]</i>

11:31.691 --> 11:33.109
<i>[static on phone]</i>

11:35.778 --> 11:36.821
<i>Detective!</i>

11:36.904 --> 11:38.155
<i>[panting rapidly]</i>

11:46.706 --> 11:47.623
<i>[gasps]</i>

11:49.583 --> 11:52.128
<i>[breathes nervously]</i>

11:52.920 --> 11:53.838
<i>Detective.</i>

<i>[police chatter on radio]</i>

12:10.563 --> 12:12.189
<i>Signs of forced entry,</i>

<i>obvious evidence of a struggle,</i>

<i>valuables left behind.</i>

12:16.318 --> 12:18.028
<i>This doesn't look like a robbery.</i>

12:18.112 --> 12:20.406
<i>Go ahead, Miss Lopez. You can say it.</i>

12:20.906 --> 12:22.575
<i>The detective's been kidnapped.</i>

12:23.409 --> 12:25.494
<i>I-I-I still haven't been able</i>
<i>to get a hold of Dan.</i>

12:25.578 --> 12:27.997
<i>Trust me,</i>
<i>he'll be of no use to us right now.</i>

12:28.080 --> 12:30.958
<i>-Trixie. Is Trixie okay?</i>
<i>-Yes, she's safe, at her grandmother's.</i>

12:32.501 --> 12:35.296
<i>The detective was re-examining</i>
<i>the Whisper Killer case.</i>

12:35.379 --> 12:39.633
<i>In her voicemail, she mentioned finding</i>
<i>proof of another serial killer out there.</i>

12:40.217 --> 12:43.304
<i>Wait, do you think that this other killer</i>
<i>found out that Chloe was onto him,</i>

12:43.387 --> 12:45.389
<i>-and this is him covering up his tracks?</i>
<i>-I do.</i>

12:45.973 --> 12:48.184
<i>I just wish we knew</i>
<i>what she'd figured out.</i>

12:48.434 --> 12:52.146
<i>[sighs] Well, her phone and her laptop</i>
<i>were smashed.</i>

12:52.229 --> 12:55.024
<i>Uh, tech team is trying to recover</i>
<i>what they can, but no guarantees.</i>

12:55.900 --> 12:58.903
<i>None of this would have happened</i>
<i>if I hadn't been distracting myself.</i>

12:58.986 --> 13:00.780
<i>I should have listened to the detective.</i>

13:03.532 --> 13:04.533
<i>Yeah, you should have.</i>

13:05.534 --> 13:07.203
<i>You should have!</i>
<i>You should have been there!</i>

13:07.286 --> 13:08.746
<i>-Miss Lopez.</i>
<i>-Why weren't you there?</i>

13:08.829 --> 13:10.539
<i>-Miss Lopez!</i>
<i>-You should have been there!</i>

13:10.664 --> 13:13.083
<i>We can't lose our heads right now.</i>

13:13.167 --> 13:14.668
<i>The detective needs us.</i>

13:19.965 --> 13:20.800
<i>You're right.</i>

13:21.759 --> 13:22.635
<i>She needs us.</i>

13:23.552 --> 13:24.804
<i>Okay, we'll keep looking.</i>

13:25.763 --> 13:26.889
<i>We'll keep looking.</i>

13:35.022 --> 13:36.524
<i>Hey, what about this? I mean,</i>

13:36.607 --> 13:39.109
<i>does this mean anything to you,</i>
<i>the name "Scotty Thomas"?</i>

13:43.781 --> 13:46.367
<i>No, but that address is downtown.</i>

13:46.450 --> 13:49.870
<i>In her message the detective mentioned</i>
<i>following a lead at the Arts District.</i>

13:50.496 --> 13:51.455
<i>Then that has to be it.</i>

13:53.123 --> 13:54.041
<i>Let's go.</i>

13:56.168 --> 13:57.545
<i>[metal grate squeaking]</i>

13:58.879 --> 13:59.880
<i>Lucifer,</i>

13:59.964 --> 14:03.259
<i>I-I-I'm a little out of my depth here.</i>
<i>I mean, I'm just a forensic scientist.</i>

14:03.342 --> 14:05.010
<i>Relax, Miss Lopez.</i>

14:05.094 --> 14:07.763
<i>We're just following a lead,</i>
<i>not walking into a killer's lair.</i>

14:07.972 --> 14:11.141
<i>Yeah, but still, I mean, don't you think</i>
<i>we should loop in an actual detective?</i>

14:11.225 --> 14:14.144
<i>We don't have time to brief someone new.</i>
<i>Here it is.</i>

14:15.145 --> 14:17.481
<i>-[grunts] Crap, it's locked.</i>
<i>-Is it?</i>

14:18.732 --> 14:19.650
<i>[snapping sound]</i>

14:20.943 --> 14:23.028
<i>-Weird. Guess not.</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

14:31.620 --> 14:34.331
<i>What was that about</i>
<i>not walking into a killer's lair?</i>

14:34.415 --> 14:35.249
<i>[Lucifer] Shh!</i>

14:36.834 --> 14:38.210
<i>Do you think Chloe's here?</i>

14:38.544 --> 14:39.670
<i>Should we call for backup?</i>

14:39.753 --> 14:41.380
<i>I'm all the backup we need.</i>

14:41.463 --> 14:43.048
<i>You're just an actor!</i>

14:43.132 --> 14:44.133
<i>[toilet flushes]</i>

<i>[man humming]</i>

14:52.182 --> 14:53.475
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>

14:53.559 --> 14:54.810
<i>-Where is she?</i>
<i>-[man whimpers]</i>

14:54.894 --> 14:56.520
<i>If you killed her,</i>
<i>I swear to Dad, I--</i>

14:56.604 --> 14:59.231
<i>Killed... Who are you?</i>
<i>Why would you think I would kill anyone?</i>

14:59.690 --> 15:02.318
<i>Oh, really? I wonder!</i>

15:02.401 --> 15:05.529
<i>[yelps] The knife? The lobby? No, no, no!</i>

15:05.613 --> 15:08.282
<i>This is just for inspiration, I swear.</i>

15:08.908 --> 15:11.911
<i>No, we got it all from a Hollywood</i>
<i>prop house that was going out of business.</i>

15:11.994 --> 15:14.371
<i>I use it to get my team</i>
<i>in the right headspace.</i>

15:16.332 --> 15:18.709
<i>What team? What headspace?</i>

15:18.792 --> 15:19.752
<i>My nerd squad.</i>

15:20.336 --> 15:24.256
<i>We're developing a virtual reality game</i>
<i>where the user gets to be a serial killer.</i>

15:24.340 --> 15:27.676
<i>[chuckles ironically] Humans. Honestly.</i>

15:27.760 --> 15:30.387
<i>Yeah, they're all blunts. Clearly props.</i>

15:31.805 --> 15:32.723
<i>Well, then...</i>

15:33.974 --> 15:36.185
<i>why did the detective</i>
<i>think this place was a lead?</i>

15:37.102 --> 15:38.437
<i>D-- Detective?</i>

15:38.896 --> 15:40.022
<i>Wait.</i>

15:40.105 --> 15:41.190
<i>Detective Decker?</i>

15:41.273 --> 15:42.191
<i>You two work with her?</i>

15:42.274 --> 15:43.734
<i>Are you Scotty Thomas?</i>

15:43.817 --> 15:44.693
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:45.194 --> 15:47.696
<i>The detective was supposed to meet me here</i>
<i>but she never showed.</i>

15:48.530 --> 15:50.491
<i>I even printed the transcripts</i>
<i>she asked for.</i>

15:53.452 --> 15:55.120
<i>Where are these transcripts?</i>

15:58.457 --> 15:59.833
<i>Show me.</i>

16:11.011 --> 16:12.972
<i>Sweet.</i>

16:13.597 --> 16:15.474
<i>Detective Decker reached out to me</i>
<i>on KillShare.</i>

16:15.557 --> 16:17.559
<i>And KillShare is...</i>

16:17.643 --> 16:21.313
<i>It's a dark web chat site</i>
<i>for those interested in, well, killing.</i>

16:21.897 --> 16:23.774
<i>Jeez, there's a site for everything.</i>

16:24.108 --> 16:25.150
<i>We use it as research.</i>

16:25.234 --> 16:27.361
<i>The posts are anonymous</i>
<i>and unmoderated.</i>

16:27.444 --> 16:30.030
<i>Anyone can post anything,</i>
<i>and I mean </i>anything.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.157
<i>People have some</i>
<i>pretty disturbing appetites.</i>

16:32.241 --> 16:35.244
<i>Appetites you'll be encouraging</i>
<i>with your serial killer game.</i>

16:35.327 --> 16:36.203
<i>Whoa, hey, man.</i>

16:36.286 --> 16:38.122
<i>As long as they're scratching </i>
<i>that itch in VR,</i>

16:38.205 --> 16:39.540
<i>they're not doing it in real life.</i>

16:39.623 --> 16:41.542
<i>Okay? I'm one of the good guys.</i>

16:41.625 --> 16:44.461
<i>And the KillShare crowd isn't exactly</i>
<i>into working with law enforcement,</i>

16:44.545 --> 16:45.754
<i>but I offered to help.</i>

16:45.838 --> 16:47.381
<i>Well, how, exactly?</i>

16:47.464 --> 16:49.633
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>Detective Decker was on KillShare</i>

16:49.717 --> 16:52.302
<i>tracking a user that</i>
<i>you guys apparently caught.</i>

16:52.386 --> 16:54.430
<i>Les Klumpsky, a.k.a. the Whisper Killer?</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:57.099
<i>I was one of the few</i>
<i>that he was direct messaging.</i>

16:57.182 --> 16:59.476
<i>And Chloe wanted to read your convos?</i>

16:59.560 --> 17:02.688
<i>Exactly. Now, the KillShare DM's,</i>
<i>they self-destruct,</i>

17:02.771 --> 17:04.732
<i>but I screencap everything.</i>

17:06.734 --> 17:08.861
<i>It's going to take forever</i>
<i>to go through all this.</i>

17:09.236 --> 17:10.404
<i>Wait, hold on.</i>

17:10.863 --> 17:13.949
<i>Klumpsky keeps referring to a "LilyMan85."</i>

17:14.033 --> 17:16.535
<i>LilyMan? Worst superhero name ever.</i>

17:19.371 --> 17:20.205
<i>[mumbles]</i>

17:20.914 --> 17:21.832
<i>Found it.</i>

17:23.292 --> 17:24.793
<i>Holy...</i>

17:26.045 --> 17:29.757
<i>All of LilyMan's posts are</i>
<i>first-hand accounts of murders</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:31.300
<i>that match the Whisperer Killer's,</i>

17:31.800 --> 17:33.969
<i>with deets that haven't even</i>
<i>gone public yet.</i>

17:35.220 --> 17:37.097
<i>Wait, Chloe said that our guy Klumpsky</i>

17:37.181 --> 17:39.516
<i>didn't do the first three murders</i>
<i>that he admitted to, right?</i>

17:39.600 --> 17:41.226
<i>Yes, that's what her message said.</i>

17:42.019 --> 17:43.270
<i>I know what she figured out.</i>

17:43.896 --> 17:45.314
<i>Klumpsky is a copycat.</i>

17:45.397 --> 17:48.984
<i>This LilyMan is the original killer,</i>
<i>the one that she said was still out there.</i>

17:49.068 --> 17:50.861
<i>Well, how do we find this LilyMan?</i>

17:51.236 --> 17:55.115
<i>Uh, well, I mean, I can get Cyber to track</i>
<i>the different IP addresses of his posts,</i>

17:55.199 --> 17:56.909
<i>but it's going to take some time.</i>

17:56.992 --> 17:58.702
<i>We don't have time!</i>

17:59.244 --> 18:02.998
<i>Well, m-maybe you can use the nerd squad.</i>
<i>Some of the best around. [chuckles]</i>

18:03.499 --> 18:04.833
<i>Oh, my gosh, thank you!</i>

18:06.543 --> 18:08.504
<i>Right. Well, while you do that...</i>

18:09.046 --> 18:11.256
<i>-I need to make a call.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

18:24.978 --> 18:26.480
<i>I thought you were supposed to help me.</i>

18:26.563 --> 18:28.774
<i>Sorry, Maze,</i>
<i>I have to get Charlie to the hospital.</i>

18:28.857 --> 18:31.819
<i>Linda's leaving her conference early,</i>
<i>so she's gonna meet us there.</i>

18:31.902 --> 18:33.153
<i>Aren't you overreacting?</i>

18:33.654 --> 18:36.907
<i>I mean, a fever of 101</i>
<i>doesn't sound like a big deal to me.</i>

18:37.449 --> 18:39.451
<i>In Hell, we kept it at a brisk 120.</i>

18:39.535 --> 18:42.538
<i>Right. Well, while 101 might not</i>
<i>be the end of the world for a normal baby,</i>

18:42.621 --> 18:45.707
<i>Charlie's part angel, so,</i>
<i>for him to be running a fever like this</i>

18:45.791 --> 18:47.668

<i>He kept my mother from me.</i>

19:11.108 --> 19:11.984
<i>No.</i>

<i>Are you sure? Because I know</i>
<i>we've been moving a little fast.</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:03.382
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>
<i>We've been moving a lot fast, and...</i>

23:04.758 --> 23:08.637
<i>I don't want to do anything</i>
<i>that would scare you away.</i>

23:09.179 --> 23:13.850
<i>Honestly, Pete, you have been</i>
<i>nothing but absolutely amazing.</i>

23:13.934 --> 23:17.396
<i>I don't even know why I've been worried</i>
<i>about moving too fast.</i>

23:18.188 --> 23:21.108
<i>See? No, but I could tell.</i>
<i>I could tell you were concerned.</i>

23:21.191 --> 23:22.859
<i>Yeah, kind of, but...</i>

23:24.027 --> 23:25.028
<i>You know what?</i>

23:25.112 --> 23:27.989
<i>For once, I know a good thing</i>
<i>when I see it, and...</i>

23:28.990 --> 23:30.450
<i>[sighs, kisses]</i>

23:30.534 --> 23:32.494
<i>I have got to rush back to the precinct,</i>

23:32.577 --> 23:33.745
<i>but you do your thing.</i>

23:33.829 --> 23:34.996
<i>This is perfect for you.</i>

23:35.080 --> 23:36.748
<i>It's connected to the Whisper Killer case.</i>

23:36.832 --> 23:38.959
<i>-Yeah, no, you got your hands full.</i>
<i>-Okay, yeah.</i>

23:39.584 --> 23:40.460
<i>-Hey.</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

23:40.544 --> 23:46.091
<i>This is probably dumb, but I did</i>
<i>a ton of research on the Whisper Killer.</i>

23:46.174 --> 23:49.302
<i>It's all in a box at my place,</i>
<i>if you would ever want it.</i>

23:49.928 --> 23:52.139
<i>Are you trying to make me like you</i>
<i>even more?</i>

23:52.222 --> 23:53.974
<i>Mm... Maybe.</i>

23:54.766 --> 23:56.351
<i>[sighs] You're just...</i>

23:56.435 --> 23:58.395
<i>Look, I-I-I'll call you later.</i>

23:58.478 --> 23:59.479
<i>-Bye.</i>
<i>-Bye.</i>

24:09.489 --> 24:10.574
<i>[grunts forcefully]</i>

24:12.325 --> 24:13.743
<i>I can't. I'm sorry.</i>

24:13.910 --> 24:14.995
<i>Try again, brother.</i>

24:15.078 --> 24:17.247
<i>I tried five times already, Lucy.</i>

24:17.330 --> 24:20.542
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>I cannot slow down time anymore.</i>

24:20.834 --> 24:23.503
<i>I haven't been able to</i>
<i>since that time I saved Linda.</i>

24:24.045 --> 24:26.173
<i>Speaking of which,</i>
<i>I should probably go find her.</i>

24:26.256 --> 24:27.757
<i>Charlie's test results should be in.</i>

24:27.841 --> 24:29.092
<i>Oh, well, thanks for nothing.</i>

24:29.509 --> 24:30.552
<i>[sighs]</i>

24:32.137 --> 24:34.264
<i>Listen, I really wish</i>
<i>I could help you find Chloe,</i>

24:34.347 --> 24:36.892
<i>-but I have faith in you, brother.</i>
<i>-Well, you shouldn't.</i>

24:36.975 --> 24:38.977
<i>I'm useless without her!</i>

24:39.561 --> 24:42.355
<i>How am I going to find the detective</i>
<i>without the detective?</i>

24:42.439 --> 24:45.400
<i>Maybe stop wasting time</i>
<i>trying to get me to slow it and just,</i>

24:45.901 --> 24:49.404
<i>you know, do some good old-fashioned</i>
<i>detective work.</i>

24:49.863 --> 24:50.906
<i>Detective work?</i>

24:51.198 --> 24:52.282
<i>[laughing] Me?</i>

24:53.241 --> 24:57.287
<i>Are you trying to tell me that after</i>
<i>all these years of working with Chloe...</i>

24:58.288 --> 24:59.998
<i>that you haven't learned anything?</i>

25:01.708 --> 25:02.584
<i>[grunts]</i>

25:03.001 --> 25:05.837
<i>Amenadiel. Dr. Subia wants to see us.</i>

25:06.171 --> 25:07.047
<i>Okay.</i>

25:07.839 --> 25:10.592
<i>You can find her, Detective Morningstar.</i>

25:27.400 --> 25:28.568
<i>[Ella] Whoa!</i>

25:29.027 --> 25:30.362
<i>Who did this for you?</i>

25:30.654 --> 25:32.405
<i>No one. I did this myself.</i>

25:32.489 --> 25:35.325
<i>I figured we needed to find similarities</i>
<i>between our victims</i>

25:35.408 --> 25:37.202
<i>in order to build our killer's profile.</i>

25:37.786 --> 25:40.080
<i>Be still my heart. Okay, what do we got?</i>

25:40.747 --> 25:43.750
<i>Well, uh, the victim we found this morning</i>
<i>is Phyllis Cameron,</i>

25:43.833 --> 25:47.128
<i>A-list movie director,</i>
<i>but based on the ME's report,</i>

25:47.212 --> 25:48.755
<i>she died a week ago, which means that</i>

25:48.838 --> 25:52.968
<i>LilyMan85 got to her before he killed</i>
<i>Diane Luna, the opera singer.</i>

25:53.051 --> 25:55.470
<i>Okay, so our guy clearly has a type:</i>
<i>powerful women.</i>

25:55.554 --> 25:57.097
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>-And Madison,</i>

25:57.180 --> 26:00.058
<i>our elementary school teacher,</i>
<i>is off-pattern because of--</i>

26:00.141 --> 26:02.143
<i>Because she was killed by</i>
<i>copycat Klumpsky.</i>

26:02.227 --> 26:04.521
<i>I mean, his sloppy trail of evidence</i>
<i>allowed us to catch him</i>

26:04.604 --> 26:06.189
<i>before he could strike again,</i>

26:06.273 --> 26:08.817
<i>but the original Whisper Killer, he's...</i>

26:09.651 --> 26:12.320
<i>He's cleverer, he's cleaner.</i>

26:12.988 --> 26:15.031
<i>Lucifer, I have got to say,</i>

26:15.115 --> 26:17.492
<i>very impressive with the detective work.</i>

26:17.867 --> 26:18.952
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:19.202 --> 26:21.580
<i>If only it were enough to find him, to...</i>

26:22.581 --> 26:23.623
<i>find her.</i>

26:23.707 --> 26:25.375
<i>And we need more than this!</i>

26:26.293 --> 26:27.502
<i>I talked to the copycat.</i>

26:28.295 --> 26:30.714
<i>Well, "talk" isn't exactly the right word.</i>

26:30.797 --> 26:32.382
<i>Well, did he scream anything of value?</i>

26:32.465 --> 26:35.218
<i>Maybe. He said that he was messaging</i>
<i>with the original killer,</i>

26:35.302 --> 26:38.972
<i>and found out that this LilyMan likes</i>
<i>to hunt his victims in restaurants.</i>

26:39.055 --> 26:43.393
<i>Copycat said, and I quote,</i>
<i>"LilyMan looks for windbags."</i>

26:43.935 --> 26:46.771
<i>So he targets women who talk a lot?</i>

26:47.647 --> 26:48.523
<i>-Gulp.</i>
<i>-Hold on.</i>

26:48.607 --> 26:51.901
<i>I think I remember seeing the last charges</i>
<i>three of the four victims made</i>

26:51.985 --> 26:52.986
<i>were at a restaurant.</i>

26:53.903 --> 26:55.780
<i>Wait, you went through</i>
<i>credit card statements</i>

26:55.864 --> 26:57.490
<i>-and cross-referenced them?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

26:57.574 --> 27:00.410
<i>Call the restaurants, find out </i>
<i>if any of them have surveillance cameras.</i>

27:00.493 --> 27:01.620
<i>I'm so on it.</i>

27:01.703 --> 27:02.704
<i>Uh, right.</i>

27:06.124 --> 27:09.336
<i>Did Klumpsky ever meet his inspiration?</i>

27:09.419 --> 27:11.379
<i>-Did he ever get a good look at him?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

27:11.463 --> 27:12.380
<i>Are you sure?</i>

27:13.840 --> 27:17.594
<i>Five broken ribs, a torn rotator cuff,</i>
<i>and "It's a Small World" on repeat?</i>

27:17.677 --> 27:19.137
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

27:19.220 --> 27:20.305
<i>[sighs]</i>

27:28.938 --> 27:31.816
<i>Okay, so only one of the places has CCTV.</i>

27:32.901 --> 27:35.403
<i>All right. Maze and I will check it out.</i>

27:35.487 --> 27:38.406
<i>And I don't know if this is helpful,</i>
<i>but...</i>

27:38.490 --> 27:41.159
<i>Pete has some pretty extensive research</i>
<i>on the Whisper Killer murders.</i>

27:41.242 --> 27:43.203
<i>I can see if he's got anything useful.</i>

27:43.286 --> 27:44.913
<i>Yes, thank you, Miss Lopez.</i>

27:45.914 --> 27:48.208
<i>Sorry, I can't show you the tapes.</i>

27:48.792 --> 27:51.252
<i>[sighs] We don't have time for torture.</i>

27:51.336 --> 27:53.380
<i>-Whoa! Torture?</i>
<i>-Do you have a better idea?</i>

27:53.463 --> 27:57.384
<i>Well, if I still had my mojo,</i>
<i>I'd just ask, "What is it you desire?"</i>

27:58.134 --> 27:59.928
<i>I want to be a dancer.</i>

28:02.097 --> 28:03.765
<i>Wait, did my mojo just work?</i>

28:06.059 --> 28:08.269
<i>I-- I've never told anyone that before.</i>

28:08.978 --> 28:11.106
<i>[chuckles] I'm back.</i>

28:11.481 --> 28:12.857
<i>Maze, I'm back!</i>

28:13.650 --> 28:16.945
<i>Right. Right, well, you're in luck,</i>
<i>Baryshnikov,</i>

28:17.028 --> 28:18.863
<i>because I happen to own a nightclub.</i>

28:18.947 --> 28:20.281
<i>So, you help us,</i>

28:20.365 --> 28:22.617
<i>I'll hire you and make your </i>Footloose
<i>dreams come true.</i>

28:22.701 --> 28:24.536
<i>-What do you say? Deal?</i>
<i>-Deal.</i>

28:24.619 --> 28:25.995
<i>[laughing] All right.</i>

28:27.330 --> 28:29.082
<i>Okay, boss. What are we looking for?</i>

28:29.165 --> 28:30.709
<i>We are looking for...</i>

28:31.418 --> 28:32.252
<i>her.</i>

28:32.335 --> 28:34.337
<i>-She was here Thursday evening.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

28:35.046 --> 28:36.297
<i>Good man.</i>

28:36.381 --> 28:37.549
<i>[keyboard clacking]</i>

28:38.133 --> 28:44.514
<i>So, have you ever heard of a demon getting</i>
<i>a soul?</i>

28:45.098 --> 28:47.392
<i>[scoffs] Of course not. That's impossible.</i>

28:49.269 --> 28:51.688
<i>Yeah, um... I've heard that all my life.</i>

28:53.022 --> 28:56.151
<i>Then again, you did fall in love.</i>

28:56.568 --> 28:58.653
<i>Amenadiel had a baby with a human.</i>

29:00.447 --> 29:02.323
<i>There's a first for everything, right?</i>

29:02.407 --> 29:06.119
<i>Well, that's different. We're angels.</i>
<i>You're just a demon.</i>

29:08.371 --> 29:09.497
<i>[computer bleeps]</i>

29:09.581 --> 29:10.790
<i>Oh! Ha!</i>

29:10.874 --> 29:13.084
<i>There she is!</i>
<i>Yes, that's definitely her.</i>

29:13.168 --> 29:15.879
<i>Right, we just need to wait</i>
<i>for the creepy guy stalking her.</i>

29:16.129 --> 29:18.339
<i>How do we even know who we're looking for?</i>

29:18.423 --> 29:19.382
<i>[groaning sigh]</i>

29:20.633 --> 29:21.509
<i>Okay.</i>

29:22.594 --> 29:23.595
<i>Never mind.</i>

29:27.307 --> 29:29.601
<i>Oh, my Dad.</i>

29:32.395 --> 29:33.271
<i>Pete?</i>

29:33.938 --> 29:36.232
<i>I haven't been able to get a hold of you.</i>
<i>Are you here?</i>

29:40.278 --> 29:41.112
<i>Pete?</i>

29:42.739 --> 29:43.615
<i>Pete?</i>

29:46.242 --> 29:47.160
<i>Guess not.</i>

29:48.828 --> 29:50.079
<i>Okay, here I go.</i>

29:50.163 --> 29:53.500
<i>Your not-at-all-creepy girlfriend,</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

31:40.231 --> 31:42.317
<i>Hey. Yeah, I...</i>

31:43.234 --> 31:47.447
<i>I called you but you didn't answer,</i>
<i>so I just...</i>

31:49.032 --> 31:53.494
<i>Anyway, I just came to grab</i>
<i>that research you offered.</i>

31:53.912 --> 31:56.414
<i>Sorry, sorry... Sorry, if I just...</i>

31:56.497 --> 31:57.457
<i>Sorry?</i>

32:01.210 --> 32:03.630
<i>That's the reason</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>No. We've only got one shot at this.</i>

<i>We can't risk him lawyering up or dying.</i>

<i>Where is Chloe?</i>

<i>We know you're LilyMan85, Pete.</i>
<i>The original Whisper Killer.</i>

<i>We have all the evidence we need</i>
<i>from your creepy little plant room.</i>

<i>God, just when I thought</i>
<i>I'd found a good guy.</i>

<i>I am a good guy.</i>

<i>Yeah, except for the whole, you know,</i>

<i>killing people part.</i>

<i>Exactly. Everyone has flaws.</i>

<i>Pete, it's not like</i>
<i>you left the toilet seat up.</i>

34:26.814 --> 34:28.483
<i>You kill people.</i>

34:28.566 --> 34:30.276
<i>Innocent women.</i>

34:31.611 --> 34:32.695
<i>Because why?</i>

<i>What, were you abused as a child?</i>

34:41.162 --> 34:41.996
<i>No.</i>

<i>and she didn't hit me,</i>

<i>she screamed at me all day, every day.</i>

<i>Is that why you cut</i>
<i>all those women's vocal cords?</i>

34:54.133 --> 34:57.261
<i>Was that too obvious? Should I have</i>
<i>cut their hearts out instead?</i>

34:59.388 --> 35:01.766
<i>All of this because</i>
<i>your mommy was mean to you?</i>

35:01.849 --> 35:03.851
<i>No, she wasn't just mean to me.</i>

<i>She didn't love me.</i>

<i>That whole time you were just using me</i>

35:21.869 --> 35:23.371
<i>to stay ahead of the investigation?</i>

35:23.454 --> 35:25.206
<i>Yeah, it started that way,</i>
<i>and then it...</i>

35:25.915 --> 35:26.958
<i>evolved.</i>

35:29.544 --> 35:30.545
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

35:32.338 --> 35:34.048
<i>You were going to kill me, weren't you?</i>

35:34.924 --> 35:36.134
<i>I mean, I...</i>

35:37.009 --> 35:38.469
<i>I fit your profile, I'm...</i>

35:38.970 --> 35:40.179
<i>I'm definitely a talker.</i>

35:40.263 --> 35:43.099
<i>Yeah, but everything you say is so nice.</i>

35:44.016 --> 35:48.729
<i>I thought with you I was finally</i>
<i>going to feel something, anything, but...</i>

35:49.230 --> 35:50.731
<i>Mm, nope.</i>

35:54.735 --> 35:58.531
<i>And I did everything right,</i>
<i>everything that you're supposed to do.</i>

35:58.614 --> 36:00.658
<i>Candlelit dinners,</i>
<i>I took you to that convention,</i>

36:00.741 --> 36:02.326
<i>I gave you a key to my apartment.</i>

36:04.370 --> 36:05.246
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:08.916
<i>You fooled me. Congrats.</i>

36:09.417 --> 36:11.711
<i>Thank you, but it didn't work.</i>

36:14.630 --> 36:17.258
<i>The only time I ever feel anything</i>

36:17.341 --> 36:19.927
<i>is when I'm hearing them</i>
<i>choke on their own blood...</i>

36:21.762 --> 36:24.015
<i>[exhales] unable to talk.</i>

36:29.228 --> 36:30.188
<i>Hmm.</i>

36:30.938 --> 36:31.856
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:32.481 --> 36:33.649
<i>Maybe... [sighs]</i>

36:38.529 --> 36:40.990
<i>Maybe if we got more time together.</i>

36:41.741 --> 36:42.700
<i>Time?</i>

36:42.783 --> 36:43.868
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

36:44.368 --> 36:47.705
<i>Time wouldn't change the fact that</i>
<i>you are a cold-blooded murderer.</i>

36:47.788 --> 36:50.791
<i>Good point, but you gotta admit,</i>
<i>we have a lot in common.</i>

36:50.875 --> 36:52.126
<i>We're nothing alike.</i>

36:52.210 --> 36:54.587
<i>Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.</i>

36:58.424 --> 37:01.844
<i>There is darkness in you, Ella.</i>

37:02.678 --> 37:05.389
<i>I recognized it the very first moment</i>
<i>that we met.</i>

37:09.894 --> 37:11.729
<i>Damn it, Pete! Just, where is Chloe?</i>

37:11.812 --> 37:15.024
<i>I don't know, okay?</i>
<i>I didn't do anything to her. I swear.</i>

37:18.194 --> 37:20.029
<i>You really have no idea where she is,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

37:20.738 --> 37:21.614
<i>Nope.</i>

37:24.575 --> 37:26.994
<i>Uh, Ells, just to be clear...</i>

37:27.078 --> 37:29.956
<i>This is you breaking up with me, right?</i>

37:30.998 --> 37:31.832
<i>Pete...</i>

37:32.708 --> 37:34.168
<i>you're going to burn in Hell.</i>

37:42.385 --> 37:44.220
<i>[whimpers]</i>

37:46.597 --> 37:47.640
<i>Damn it.</i>

37:48.140 --> 37:50.476
<i>This human stain is telling the truth.</i>

37:51.143 --> 37:53.896
<i>He has no idea where she is.</i>

37:54.689 --> 37:59.235
<i>I've wasted all this time</i>
<i>looking for the wrong bloody person!</i>

37:59.318 --> 38:01.279
<i>[growls, yells]</i>

38:02.655 --> 38:04.240
<i>This is all my fault!</i>

38:05.866 --> 38:07.034
<i>I don't understand.</i>

38:08.119 --> 38:09.495
<i>Where is she?</i>

38:10.329 --> 38:13.124
<i>Who else would want to hurt the detective?</i>

38:14.834 --> 38:16.544
<i>What if this isn't about her?</i>

38:18.421 --> 38:20.548
<i>Lucifer, what if it's about hurting you?</i>

38:23.968 --> 38:24.969
<i>[Chloe grunting]</i>

38:27.388 --> 38:28.306
<i>[coughing]</i>

38:37.356 --> 38:38.232
<i>[grunts]</i>

38:41.152 --> 38:42.486
<i>[footsteps approaching]</i>

38:52.246 --> 38:54.373
<i>Hello, Detective.</i>

39:10.139 --> 39:15.019
<i>One tall non-fat almond milk latte</i>
<i>with sugar-free caramel drizzle.</i>

39:15.728 --> 39:16.979
<i>It's your favorite, come on.</i>

39:17.563 --> 39:19.148
<i>Come on.</i>

39:23.861 --> 39:24.737
<i>Hey!</i>

39:25.571 --> 39:27.782
<i>That was, like, seven bucks.</i>

39:27.865 --> 39:29.617
<i>-God.</i>
<i>-What am I doing here, Michael?</i>

39:29.700 --> 39:30.868
<i>Don't worry.</i>

39:30.951 --> 39:32.495
<i>This is just temporary.</i>

39:33.371 --> 39:34.705
<i>It's all part of a bigger plan.</i>

39:34.789 --> 39:38.042
<i>Plan? What, to make me</i>
<i>dislike you even more?</i>

39:38.125 --> 39:38.959
<i>No.</i>

39:39.460 --> 39:41.420
<i>But... spoiler alert!</i>

39:41.504 --> 39:43.047
<i>It is gonna be epic.</i>

39:43.714 --> 39:44.757
<i>Just you wait.</i>

39:46.133 --> 39:47.593
<i>Till then, I, uh...</i>

39:48.969 --> 39:50.429
<i>I figured we should catch up.</i>

39:50.888 --> 39:53.933
<i>I mean, a lot has happened</i>
<i>since we saw each other last.</i>

39:54.016 --> 39:55.559
<i>And why would I talk to you?</i>

39:55.643 --> 39:57.478
<i>Because you want to know what they mean,</i>

39:58.312 --> 40:00.356
<i>the changes that my brother's</i>
<i>been going through.</i>

40:00.439 --> 40:01.690
<i>Although, deep down,</i>

40:01.774 --> 40:04.026
<i>I think you probably already know,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

40:04.110 --> 40:05.319
<i>Oh, so it's this again?</i>

40:05.403 --> 40:08.072
<i>Trying to make me afraid</i>
<i>about my relationship with Lucifer?</i>

40:08.155 --> 40:10.074
<i>Now, you see, that's just it, Detective.</i>

40:10.157 --> 40:13.953
<i>Just like Lucifer can't create desires,</i>
<i>I can't create fears.</i>

40:14.036 --> 40:14.912
<i>I just...</i>

40:15.621 --> 40:17.373
<i>expose what's already there,</i>

40:17.456 --> 40:21.252
<i>and, girl, you reek of fear. [chuckles]</i>

40:21.752 --> 40:23.546
<i>You don't know what you're talking about.</i>

40:24.004 --> 40:28.467
<i>So, what, you're not afraid of what</i>
<i>his newfound invulnerability means?</i>

40:29.218 --> 40:32.388
<i>'Cause you do know that we angels,</i>
<i>we self-actualize, right?</i>

40:32.471 --> 40:36.350
<i>Which means him choosing to be vulnerable</i>
<i>around you actually meant something,</i>

40:36.434 --> 40:38.394
<i>so I'm just, you know,</i>
<i>putting it out there,</i>

40:38.477 --> 40:42.106
<i>but I wonder what this new development</i>
<i>could mean.</i>

40:42.189 --> 40:43.065
<i>You're wrong.</i>

40:43.774 --> 40:45.651
<i>Lucifer and I are closer than ever.</i>

40:47.194 --> 40:48.112
<i>Huh.</i>

40:48.446 --> 40:49.613
<i>Yeah, you're probably right.</i>

40:49.697 --> 40:52.116
<i>I mean, we all know Lucifer doesn't lie.</i>

40:52.408 --> 40:56.912
<i>So, when he tells you he loves you,</i>
<i>you know he really means it, right?</i>

41:00.499 --> 41:02.126
<i>Unless...</i>

41:04.336 --> 41:05.171
<i>Oh, no.</i>

41:05.254 --> 41:08.466
<i>No, no. no. He hasn't said it yet, has he?</i>

41:08.924 --> 41:10.342
<i>Even though you said it to him?</i>

41:10.426 --> 41:12.470
<i>That is... [groans]</i>

41:13.929 --> 41:17.600
<i>Looks like you'll maybe need some time</i>
<i>to yourself, so...</i>

41:19.059 --> 41:21.437
<i>I have a quick errand to run,</i>
<i>but don't worry, Detective.</i>

41:21.520 --> 41:23.314
<i>I will be back before you know it.</i>

41:25.441 --> 41:26.567
<i>Enjoy the cave.</i>

41:27.151 --> 41:28.068
<i>[giggles]</i>

41:34.283 --> 41:35.493
<i>[roars]</i>

41:45.044 --> 41:46.795
<i>Found him in a bar, wasted.</i>

41:49.340 --> 41:50.216
<i>Daniel.</i>

41:50.299 --> 41:52.218
<i>No! No, no, no!</i>

41:52.301 --> 41:53.385
<i>Daniel! Daniel!</i>

41:53.469 --> 41:54.845
<i>Relax! Relax!</i>

41:56.555 --> 41:58.098
<i>Stay away from me, don't hurt me.</i>

41:58.182 --> 41:59.642
<i>Oh! Says the man who shot me.</i>

42:00.518 --> 42:02.394
<i>Listen, Daniel,</i>
<i>I know we've had our differences,</i>

42:02.478 --> 42:04.980
<i>but right now, what's happening</i>
<i>is far more important than us.</i>

42:05.439 --> 42:06.315
<i>Tell me...</i>

42:07.191 --> 42:08.776
<i>the night that you saw my face,</i>

42:08.859 --> 42:10.736
<i>why did you come back to the house?</i>

42:10.819 --> 42:11.820
<i>Wha--?</i>

42:12.530 --> 42:13.739
<i>Because you called me.</i>

42:14.406 --> 42:15.616
<i>You asked me to.</i>

42:15.699 --> 42:16.700
<i>[sighs]</i>

42:17.701 --> 42:21.247
<i>I didn't make that call, Daniel,</i>
<i>but I think I know who did.</i>

42:21.330 --> 42:22.289
<i>Who?</i>

42:22.373 --> 42:23.624
<i>My twin.</i>

42:23.707 --> 42:24.583
<i>Michael.</i>

42:25.751 --> 42:26.585
<i>Oh.</i>

42:27.711 --> 42:29.880
<i>[chuckles] Dreadful poker face.</i>

42:29.964 --> 42:32.007
<i>He's the one who told you to shoot me, </i>
<i>isn't he?</i>

42:32.633 --> 42:35.261
<i>Look, I hate to break it to you, Daniel,</i>
<i>but you have been played.</i>

42:35.970 --> 42:37.846
<i>But Michael's an angel,</i>

42:38.305 --> 42:40.182
<i>and you're the Devil,</i>
<i>you're the Prince of Lies.</i>

42:40.266 --> 42:41.475
<i>Dan!</i>

42:41.559 --> 42:44.603
<i>Chloe has been kidnapped by Michael.</i>

42:44.687 --> 42:46.230
<i>We need to find her before he does</i>

42:46.313 --> 42:48.983
<i>whatever angelic things</i>
<i>he's planning on doing!</i>

42:49.066 --> 42:50.651
<i>Wait, what do you mean, kidnapped?</i>

42:50.734 --> 42:52.486
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Is that why everyone's on high alert?</i>

42:52.570 --> 42:53.654
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

42:53.737 --> 42:55.864
<i>Somebody let me out of here so I can help!</i>

42:55.948 --> 42:57.741
<i>-Open the door!</i>
<i>-What are you going to do?</i>

42:58.450 --> 43:00.452
<i>Tell them that some archangel took her?</i>

43:00.661 --> 43:02.204
<i>We are on the same side here.</i>

43:02.288 --> 43:03.539
<i>Only we can save her,</i>

43:03.622 --> 43:07.334
<i>and the only way you can help</i>
<i>is by telling me where you saw Michael.</i>

43:08.252 --> 43:09.503
<i>You're hurting me.</i>

43:11.630 --> 43:12.631
<i>[gasps]</i>

43:17.928 --> 43:18.804
<i>Okay.</i>

43:20.014 --> 43:20.973
<i>Okay...</i>

43:22.099 --> 43:23.058
<i>Michael...</i>

43:23.684 --> 43:26.312
<i>He came to me at the cemetery.</i>

43:27.730 --> 43:30.482
<i>But then he... He flew me someplace else.</i>

43:31.400 --> 43:33.360
<i>Uh, someplace private so we could talk.</i>

43:33.694 --> 43:34.612
<i>It was, uh...</i>

43:34.695 --> 43:36.572
<i>It was some weird cave.</i>

43:36.655 --> 43:39.742
<i>Private? Well, that might be</i>
<i>where he has Chloe. Where's this cave?</i>

43:40.242 --> 43:42.036
<i>Well, I-I-I don't know exactly.</i>

43:42.119 --> 43:44.246
<i>How can you not know?</i>
<i>Did he blindfold you?</i>

43:44.913 --> 43:46.915
<i>Well, I kind... I-I kind of...</i>

43:47.916 --> 43:50.127
<i>maybe passed out on the flight there.</i>

43:51.378 --> 43:52.504
<i>-And back.</i>
<i>-[sighs]</i>

43:52.588 --> 43:54.965
<i>You have got to be kidding me!</i>

43:55.049 --> 43:57.885
<i>Come on, I'm afraid of heights.</i>
<i>You know what roller coasters do to me.</i>

43:59.219 --> 44:02.181
<i>And believe me, flying is... </i>
<i>It's way worse.</i>

44:02.264 --> 44:04.099
<i>Is there anything of value</i>
<i>that you can tell me,</i>

44:04.183 --> 44:06.185
<i>or are you just completely useless?</i>

44:07.353 --> 44:10.022
<i>Look, the cave, it was strange, all right?</i>
<i>It was... It was...</i>

44:10.522 --> 44:11.690
<i>Parts of it, it looked fake.</i>

44:12.358 --> 44:14.193
<i>There were... There were bars on it,</i>

44:14.526 --> 44:16.737
<i>and it seemed like nobody had been there</i>
<i>in a really...</i>

44:17.780 --> 44:18.822
<i>really long time.</i>

44:28.957 --> 44:30.084
<i>[metal door opening]</i>

44:35.673 --> 44:36.674
<i>[man grunts]</i>

44:37.257 --> 44:38.342
<i>[panting]</i>

44:38.842 --> 44:39.677
<i>[gasps]</i>

44:41.553 --> 44:43.889
<i>Maze, Dan, what are you doing here?</i>

44:45.432 --> 44:48.143
<i>That's a pretty mighty swing</i>
<i>you've got there, Detective.</i>

44:49.228 --> 44:51.313
<i>Are all abandoned zoos this dangerous?</i>

44:52.981 --> 44:54.024
<i>Lucifer...</i>

45:00.030 --> 45:01.115
<i>[both kissing, moaning]</i>

45:03.992 --> 45:06.120
<i>I'm so sorry. I thought you were Michael.</i>

45:06.203 --> 45:07.705
<i>Oh, it's okay.</i>

45:08.247 --> 45:09.790
<i>You can whack me anytime.</i>

45:10.916 --> 45:11.959
<i>[sighs]</i>

45:12.835 --> 45:15.045
<i>He really does care about her, doesn't he?</i>

45:17.464 --> 45:18.382
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:19.633 --> 45:21.176
<i>Freaking soulmates.</i>

45:27.725 --> 45:28.851
<i>Good news.</i>

45:31.228 --> 45:33.063
<i>Charlie's fever has subsided.</i>

45:33.147 --> 45:35.107
<i>Just your normal, run-of-the-mill cold.</i>

45:35.190 --> 45:36.358
<i>[both sighing]</i>

45:36.525 --> 45:38.235
<i>-Ready to see him?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

45:38.318 --> 45:39.403
<i>Right this way.</i>

45:44.032 --> 45:45.200
<i>Hello, brother.</i>

45:46.952 --> 45:47.786
<i>Michael?</i>

45:50.539 --> 45:51.582
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

45:51.665 --> 45:55.169
<i>I heard that Charlie was sick,</i>
<i>so I came to show my support.</i>

45:55.252 --> 45:57.171
<i>Yeah. "Support"?</i>

45:57.254 --> 45:59.715
<i>Despite our differences,</i>
<i>we're still family,</i>

46:00.215 --> 46:02.509
<i>and that includes Charlie.</i>

46:03.135 --> 46:05.846
<i>And I heard the doctor say it was</i>
<i>just a normal cold.</i>

46:05.929 --> 46:07.765
<i>I'm... I'm so sorry.</i>

46:08.807 --> 46:11.393
<i>What do you mean "sorry," Michael?</i>
<i>That's good news.</i>

46:12.519 --> 46:15.939
<i>But, brother, you understand</i>
<i>what that means, right?</i>

46:16.023 --> 46:18.025
<i>No, what?</i>

46:19.610 --> 46:20.527
<i>[sighs]</i>

46:24.740 --> 46:27.868
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

46:28.952 --> 46:30.370
<i>Surprised to see me?</i>

46:32.831 --> 46:33.749
<i>[chuckles]</i>

46:34.208 --> 46:36.627
<i>No, actually, Mazikeen,</i>

46:37.044 --> 46:39.338
<i>you are exactly the demon I wanted to see.</i>

46:39.421 --> 46:40.589
<i>In fact,</i>

46:40.672 --> 46:42.841
<i>you're a little earlier than I expected.</i>

46:42.925 --> 46:46.470
<i>I am so tired</i>
<i>of your bullshit games, Michael.</i>

46:47.513 --> 46:49.807
<i>Tired of you messing with me</i>
<i>and my friends.</i>

46:50.307 --> 46:51.475
<i>Kidnapping Chloe...</i>

46:52.643 --> 46:54.186
<i>that was a step too far.</i>

46:55.103 --> 46:57.481
<i>Now I'm going to have a little fun</i>
<i>carving you up.</i>

46:58.899 --> 47:00.359
<i>Come on.</i>

47:00.943 --> 47:03.529
<i>That's a little extreme, don't you think?</i>
<i>I mean,</i>

47:04.196 --> 47:06.490
<i>I was never going to hurt Chloe.</i>

47:08.742 --> 47:09.952
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

47:11.036 --> 47:16.458
<i>Mazikeen, I am the only one</i>
<i>who has been honest with you.</i>

47:19.086 --> 47:20.504
<i>Who told you about the ring?</i>

47:20.587 --> 47:23.173
<i>All that did was show me</i>
<i>how much my life sucks.</i>

47:23.257 --> 47:26.927
<i>Which is exactly why</i>
<i>I wanted to talk to you.</i>

47:29.805 --> 47:31.473
<i>Listen, I can help you,</i>

47:31.932 --> 47:33.433
<i>because when I get what I want,</i>

47:34.142 --> 47:35.227
<i>so can you.</i>

47:37.771 --> 47:40.065
<i>And we are so close, Mazikeen,</i>

47:40.148 --> 47:44.236
<i>so, so close to my plan</i>
<i>finally coming together.</i>

47:52.452 --> 47:58.208
<i>I just want to say how grateful I am</i>
<i>for all of your hard work and...</i>

47:59.042 --> 48:02.588
<i>for never giving up on trying to find me,</i>
<i>and, um...</i>

48:03.714 --> 48:08.176
<i>you know, words cannot</i>
<i>express this enough, but...</i>

48:14.141 --> 48:15.058
<i>thank you.</i>

48:16.226 --> 48:17.269
<i>Thank you, guys.</i>

48:17.853 --> 48:18.770
<i>Thank you.</i>

48:24.234 --> 48:25.861
<i>Brother! Brother, we need to talk.</i>

48:26.486 --> 48:28.196
<i>Something terrible has happened</i>
<i>with Charlie.</i>

48:28.280 --> 48:29.323
<i>What, did he get worse?</i>

48:29.406 --> 48:32.242
<i>No! No, he got better,</i>

48:32.326 --> 48:33.452
<i>but it's just...</i>

48:35.412 --> 48:36.788
<i>It's just a normal cold.</i>

48:38.373 --> 48:40.417
<i>[chuckles] Right, well, </i>
<i>I don't see the problem.</i>

48:40.500 --> 48:41.835
<i>That's what I've been saying.</i>

48:41.919 --> 48:44.087
<i>-No, listen, we really have to--</i>
<i>-No, I'm sorry, brother,</i>

48:44.171 --> 48:45.631
<i>but I'm a little busy at the moment.</i>

48:45.714 --> 48:48.008
<i>The detective and I</i>
<i>haven't yet had a chance to talk.</i>

48:48.508 --> 48:49.509
<i>Can this wait?</i>

48:49.593 --> 48:53.805
<i>-No! This is--</i>
<i>-Yes! Yes, it can. Come on.</i>

48:53.889 --> 48:55.933
<i>I... [scoffs lightly]</i>

48:56.391 --> 48:57.225
<i>Hi.</i>

48:57.309 --> 48:58.143
<i>Hi.</i>

48:58.226 --> 48:59.686
<i>-Hey.</i>
<i>-Hi.</i>

49:00.228 --> 49:01.438
<i>Uh... Um...</i>

49:02.731 --> 49:03.732
<i>Can we talk?</i>

49:04.524 --> 49:05.734
<i>Somewhere private?</i>

49:06.860 --> 49:08.862
<i>Yeah. Of course.</i>

49:09.947 --> 49:10.822
<i>Here.</i>

49:11.365 --> 49:12.449
<i>How's Ella doing?</i>

49:13.075 --> 49:13.951
<i>She's, uh...</i>

49:15.118 --> 49:16.995
<i>She's as well as could be expected.</i>

49:17.079 --> 49:18.997
<i>She's happy that you're safe, but...</i>

49:19.456 --> 49:21.625
<i>[sighs] Poor Ella.</i>

49:21.708 --> 49:23.168
<i>I feel terrible for her.</i>

49:23.627 --> 49:25.170
<i>I'll check in with her later.</i>

49:26.964 --> 49:27.881
<i>Detective...</i>

49:29.049 --> 49:31.343
<i>I am so incredibly sorry.</i>

49:32.761 --> 49:33.971
<i>For what?</i>

49:34.429 --> 49:37.182
<i>For taking so long to find you,</i>

49:37.265 --> 49:39.893
<i>for getting you caught up</i>
<i>in my family mess,</i>

49:39.977 --> 49:43.355
<i>for everything you had to endure</i>
<i>with my psycho twin brother.</i>

49:43.438 --> 49:45.357
<i>Lucifer, everybody has a weird family.</i>

49:45.440 --> 49:47.776
<i>-[scoffs] </i>
<i>-I'm not gonna lie,</i>

49:48.151 --> 49:50.445
<i>it wasn't fun being kidnapped, but...</i>

49:52.447 --> 49:53.782
<i>I knew you were out there</i>

49:54.366 --> 49:56.076
<i>the whole time, looking for me.</i>

49:59.037 --> 50:01.164
<i>What I'm worried about now</i>
<i>is Michael, he...</i>

50:01.623 --> 50:04.459
<i>He said that this was all part</i>
<i>of some bigger plan and...</i>

50:05.335 --> 50:07.129
<i>Sh-Sh-Should we go find him?</i>

50:07.212 --> 50:10.215
<i>Well, I'll deal with him later.</i>
<i>Right now I'm just...</i>

50:11.341 --> 50:12.968
<i>I'm just happy to have you back.</i>

50:13.510 --> 50:14.761
<i>[both sighing]</i>

50:16.596 --> 50:17.431
<i>Well...</i>

50:18.140 --> 50:20.392
<i>But from what I heard,</i>
<i>you really didn't need me.</i>

50:20.475 --> 50:22.561
<i>You caught a serial killer on your own?</i>

50:22.644 --> 50:27.524
<i>Uh, well, Maze and Miss Lopez helped a bit</i>
<i>but, yes, I suppose it was mostly me.</i>

50:27.607 --> 50:28.817
<i>[laughs]</i>

50:28.900 --> 50:30.527
<i>And you, in a way.</i>

50:31.319 --> 50:33.280
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-I channeled you, Detective.</i>

50:33.739 --> 50:36.658
<i>Did some actual case work.</i>
<i>I really was my best you.</i>

50:36.742 --> 50:38.994
<i>Oh! And my best me.</i>

50:39.453 --> 50:41.371
<i>By the way, my mojo's back.</i>

50:41.872 --> 50:42.831
<i>Isn't that great?</i>

50:44.416 --> 50:45.667
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

50:47.711 --> 50:49.421
<i>Yeah, that's... That is great.</i>

50:51.131 --> 50:52.049
<i>What's wrong?</i>

50:52.883 --> 50:54.676
<i>Nothing. Nothing.</i>

50:54.760 --> 50:55.844
<i>-Uh...</i>
<i>-[scoffs]</i>

50:55.927 --> 50:57.012
<i>I just...</i>

50:58.638 --> 51:00.807
<i>Do you think I can still mojo you?</i>

51:00.891 --> 51:03.560
<i>Well, there's no need.</i>
<i>I promise to tell you everything I desire,</i>

51:03.643 --> 51:04.603
<i>no mojo required.</i>

51:04.686 --> 51:07.147
<i>That's assuming you know what you want.</i>

51:08.231 --> 51:09.191
<i>Excuse me?</i>

51:11.693 --> 51:12.569
<i>[inhales]</i>

51:14.780 --> 51:15.989
<i>I'm just wondering...</i>

51:17.324 --> 51:20.077
<i>if subconsciously you might be</i>
<i>pushing me away,</i>

51:20.160 --> 51:23.163
<i>'cause you say that you want this and...</i>

51:23.246 --> 51:25.290
<i>you say that you want us, but...</i>

51:26.458 --> 51:27.292
<i>But do you?</i>

51:27.375 --> 51:29.002
<i>Where is this coming from?</i>

51:29.419 --> 51:30.754
<i>Well, if, mojo-wise,</i>

51:31.338 --> 51:32.881
<i>you're no longer letting me in,</i>

51:32.964 --> 51:35.175
<i>if, if now, you're...</i>

51:35.967 --> 51:37.761
<i>invulnerable all the time,</i>

51:37.928 --> 51:39.763
<i>doesn't that mean that you're...</i>

51:40.347 --> 51:43.809
<i>no longer choosing</i>
<i>to be vulnerable with me?</i>

51:44.851 --> 51:45.977
<i>I know what's happened here.</i>

51:46.061 --> 51:48.647
<i>Michael got inside your head, didn't he?</i>
<i>What did he say to you?</i>

51:48.730 --> 51:50.732
<i>You know he taps into people's fears.</i>

51:52.317 --> 51:53.443
<i>And, yeah, I...</i>

51:53.527 --> 51:56.738
<i>-Yes, I guess part of me is afraid.</i>
<i>-Of what?</i>

51:58.281 --> 51:59.199
<i>Um...</i>

52:00.325 --> 52:02.285
<i>Afraid that you don't...</i>

52:03.245 --> 52:05.956
<i>feel the same way that I feel about you.</i>

52:06.039 --> 52:06.998
<i>What?</i>

52:07.415 --> 52:08.250
<i>And...</i>

52:09.459 --> 52:10.961
<i>the last thing I want to do is</i>

52:11.628 --> 52:13.839
<i>push you into saying something</i>
<i>you don't want to,</i>

52:13.922 --> 52:15.215
<i>but I know you can't lie.</i>

52:19.010 --> 52:21.304
<i>So just tell me, is that...</i>

52:23.431 --> 52:24.891
<i>why you haven't said it back?</i>

52:25.767 --> 52:27.519
<i>Haven't said what back?</i>

52:32.440 --> 52:33.984
<i>-Oh...</i>
<i>-[Chloe sniffles]</i>

52:34.818 --> 52:36.444
<i>I... [exhales]</i>

52:36.987 --> 52:38.363
<i>But Detective, I...</i>

52:39.447 --> 52:40.949
<i>It's... It's complicated.</i>

52:42.284 --> 52:44.786
<i>-[sniffles] All right.</i>
<i>-No, I-I-I mean...</i>

52:45.453 --> 52:47.622
<i>Detective, I do, of course I do.</i>

52:47.706 --> 52:48.915
<i>-It's...</i>
<i>-Right, right.</i>

52:48.999 --> 52:50.584
<i>No, Dete-- Chloe.</i>

52:54.421 --> 52:55.297
<i>I...</i>

52:59.092 --> 53:00.051
<i>I lo--</i>

53:05.724 --> 53:06.725
<i>Detective?</i>

53:12.772 --> 53:13.648
<i>What?</i>

53:34.461 --> 53:35.545
<i>Amenadiel!</i>

53:39.633 --> 53:40.842
<i>Brother!</i>

53:40.926 --> 53:44.471
<i>Could you have chosen a worse moment</i>
<i>to slow down time?</i>

53:44.554 --> 53:46.890
<i>It hasn't slowed, it's stopped!</i>

53:46.973 --> 53:49.893
<i>Well, would you kindly</i>
<i>unstop it, then, please?</i>

53:50.268 --> 53:52.771
<i>Lucy, look. Just... look.</i>

53:54.231 --> 53:55.190
<i>He's frozen.</i>

53:55.857 --> 53:57.567
<i>Charlie. Charlie's frozen.</i>

53:57.651 --> 54:02.239
<i>Yes, as is everything and everyone else,</i>
<i>including the detective.</i>

54:02.322 --> 54:04.991
<i>Exactly. Everyone but us celestials.</i>

54:05.575 --> 54:08.036
<i>-Do you understand what that means?</i>
<i>-I... </i>

54:08.119 --> 54:09.704
<i>It means Michael was right.</i>

54:11.414 --> 54:13.166
<i>Charlie is... is mortal.</i>

54:14.334 --> 54:15.335
<i>And?</i>

54:15.877 --> 54:18.964
<i>And all of this time I thought...</i>

54:21.800 --> 54:24.469
<i>I assumed he was like me, like us.</i>

54:24.970 --> 54:25.971
<i>But he's not.</i>

54:26.513 --> 54:30.392
<i>He's just like every other</i>
<i>ordinary human child.</i>

54:30.475 --> 54:31.726
<i>He'll get sick again,</i>

54:32.686 --> 54:33.895
<i>he'll feel pain,</i>

54:33.979 --> 54:35.563
<i>grow old, suffer!</i>

54:36.731 --> 54:39.526
<i>Oh. Right, now I understand.</i>

54:40.026 --> 54:43.029
<i>You stopped time to prevent</i>
<i>all that from happening.</i>

54:44.155 --> 54:45.073
<i>Well,</i>

54:45.407 --> 54:48.576
<i>would you deal with</i>
<i>your parental anxieties later?</i>

54:48.660 --> 54:50.412
<i>Right now I need you</i>
<i>to hit the play button</i>

54:50.495 --> 54:52.122
<i>because I have a relationship to fix!</i>

54:52.205 --> 54:53.456
<i>I have no idea how!</i>

54:53.623 --> 54:56.209
<i>-Well...</i>
<i>-I didn't do anything to make this happen!</i>

54:56.293 --> 54:59.170
<i>Not consciously, obviously, but this is</i>
<i>clearly triggered by your fears,</i>

54:59.254 --> 55:02.007
<i>so just stop being afraid!</i>

55:02.340 --> 55:04.175
<i>Easier said than done.</i>

55:06.011 --> 55:10.223
<i>Amenadiel, I am impressed. [chuckles]</i>

55:10.307 --> 55:14.436
<i>I was hoping that you would</i>
<i>spiral out of control, but...</i>

55:14.519 --> 55:17.063
<i>completely stopping time? [laughs]</i>

55:18.315 --> 55:19.858
<i>Way to be an overachiever!</i>

55:19.941 --> 55:24.029
<i>Well, if it isn't</i>
<i>Mr. Bigger Plans himself.</i>

55:24.404 --> 55:26.406
<i>Of course you're behind this, too.</i>

55:26.489 --> 55:29.451
<i>How are you and the little lovebird doing?</i>

55:29.534 --> 55:32.620
<i>Hmm? Have you realized </i>
<i>it will never work yet?</i>

55:33.538 --> 55:37.751
<i>Look, I get going after me,</i>
<i>but why bring Amenadiel into this?</i>

55:37.834 --> 55:39.419
<i>What's your endgame here?</i>

55:39.502 --> 55:42.797
<i>Oh, you'll just have to wait and see.</i>
<i>And I didn't do anything to Amenadiel.</i>

55:43.673 --> 55:47.427
<i>I mean, I can't help it if he's afraid</i>
<i>of his son's snotty nose.</i>

55:49.262 --> 55:52.974
<i>Amenadiel, Michael is probably responsible</i>
<i>for Charlie's illness.</i>

55:53.058 --> 55:54.726
<i>Come on, I would never.</i>

55:54.809 --> 55:55.685
<i>He's lying.</i>

55:57.312 --> 55:58.480
<i>Amenadiel,</i>

55:58.563 --> 56:03.276
<i>what makes more sense,</i>
<i>that I somehow gave your child a cold,</i>

56:04.402 --> 56:08.198
<i>or that Chucky here got sick</i>
<i>because he's a frail, little mortal</i>

56:08.281 --> 56:11.034
<i>who's destined to suffer and die</i>
<i>a horrible human death?</i>

56:11.576 --> 56:13.703
<i>Amenadiel, Charlie's not going to die.</i>

56:13.787 --> 56:16.164
<i>-Now who's lying?</i>
<i>-I meant anytime soon.</i>

56:16.247 --> 56:17.791
<i>But they grow up so fast.</i>

56:17.874 --> 56:20.377
<i>Don't listen to him, brother.</i>
<i>Don't let him get inside your head.</i>

56:20.460 --> 56:22.170
<i>I'm just saying</i>
<i>what he's already thinking.</i>

56:22.253 --> 56:25.256
<i>[growls] Why? Why are you doing this?</i>

56:25.340 --> 56:27.050
<i>Oh, again with the blame game.</i>

56:27.133 --> 56:30.345
<i>It's not my fault you impregnated</i>
<i>one of these filthy little humans.</i>

56:33.181 --> 56:34.766
<i>[laughs]</i>

56:35.016 --> 56:37.018
<i>I mean, look at her.</i>

56:37.602 --> 56:38.728
<i>So helpless.</i>

56:39.979 --> 56:41.731
<i>Just like your son.</i>

56:43.316 --> 56:44.859
<i>-[roars]</i>
<i>-[woman grunts]</i>

56:46.486 --> 56:47.529
<i>[straining]</i>

56:53.284 --> 56:54.119
<i>Maze.</i>

56:55.328 --> 56:56.454
<i>Why are you defending him?</i>

56:56.538 --> 56:58.373
<i>Because he promised me a soul.</i>

56:58.873 --> 57:01.000
<i>[laughs] That's impossible.</i>

57:01.376 --> 57:03.962
<i>Why? Because I'm just a demon?</i>

57:04.796 --> 57:05.630
<i>Exactly.</i>

57:05.713 --> 57:07.048
<i>[roars] </i>

57:18.184 --> 57:19.102
<i>Get up.</i>

57:24.441 --> 57:25.358
<i>We're not done.</i>

57:26.609 --> 57:29.612
<i>Why would you ever trust Michael?</i>
<i>He's a liar!</i>

57:29.696 --> 57:31.531
<i>[grunting]</i>

57:32.991 --> 57:35.577
<i>He's only ever been honest with me.</i>

57:36.119 --> 57:37.579
<i>[both grunting]</i>

57:38.329 --> 57:39.164
<i>You...</i>

57:39.622 --> 57:41.166
<i>You hid my mother from me.</i>

57:41.249 --> 57:42.417
<i>How did you--</i>

57:46.796 --> 57:49.924
<i>I'm sorry, Maze,</i>
<i>but I gave Lilith my word.</i>

57:50.008 --> 57:52.969
<i>Which is apparently more important to you</i>
<i>than I am!</i>

57:53.052 --> 57:54.846
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-[yells]</i>

58:06.524 --> 58:07.775
<i>[both grunting]</i>

58:10.320 --> 58:13.281
<i>I can't believe you'd use</i>
<i>my infant son as a pawn!</i>

58:20.205 --> 58:22.707
<i>I can't believe how easy it was</i>
<i>triggering you! [giggles]</i>

58:22.790 --> 58:26.211
<i>I mean, way easier than turning</i>
<i>Lucifer's friends against him.</i>

58:34.010 --> 58:37.013
<i>[groans, laughs]</i>

58:50.193 --> 58:51.152
<i>[groans]</i>

<i>[Michael panting]</i>

<i>[groans]</i>

<i>[others grunting, shouting]</i>

1:00:02.015 --> 1:00:03.391
<i>[man] That's enough!</i>

1:00:15.570 --> 1:00:16.613
<i>Dad.</i>

1:00:23.202 --> 1:00:24.287
<i>Children.</i>

1:00:25.038 --> 1:00:26.789
<i>You know I hate it when you fight.</i>
