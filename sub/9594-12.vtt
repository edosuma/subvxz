WEBVTT

00:27.561 --> 00:29.663
Mandatory meeting
in one minute!

00:32.400 --> 00:35.503
You and your baby hands are
gonna have to wait.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.138
I'm having a mandatory
hamburger.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.441
Yeah, and I'm having a
mandatory burrito, Baby Hands.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.445
Forty-seven seconds!

00:45.579 --> 00:47.515
And I don't have baby hands.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.721
Mandatory meeting
in 37 seconds!

00:53.821 --> 00:57.725
Please, what is the meaning
of this mandatory word?

00:57.825 --> 01:00.594
Nice try. I know you
understand our language.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.731
-Baby Hands.
-I heard that.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.401
Mandatory meeting in...

01:09.803 --> 01:13.107
Mandatory meeting
in three, two, one...

01:14.942 --> 01:17.711
They just don't take this
meeting seriously anymore.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.348
I remember our very first
mandatory meeting.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.250
ROBIN: Things
were so different.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.586
Welcome to the very first
mandatory meeting
of the Teen Titans.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.655
I should have taught
them to respect me

01:27.755 --> 01:29.823
when they were still fresh
and impressionable.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.393
Back then, Raven was actually
happy to be here.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.362
Do I get extra credit
for showing up early?

01:34.462 --> 01:36.697
ROBIN: And Starfire was
fresh off the spaceship.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.499
She didn't even understand
the language.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.504
ROBIN: And Beast Boy
and Cyborg were still too
shy to gang up on me.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.273
They weren't even friends yet.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.875
Ah, those were the days.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.543
If only I could go back.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.412
Well, too bad you can't,
Baby Hands.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.782
-Oh!
-He got some baby hands.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.650
I do not have baby hands!

02:00.754 --> 02:03.191
Crime Alert!
Brother Blood is in Jump City.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.558
Titans!

02:04.658 --> 02:07.328
Don't bother to wait for me
to say go. Just go!

02:19.640 --> 02:21.675
Oh!

02:21.775 --> 02:24.478
The Titans have stopped
you before, Brother Blood,

02:24.578 --> 02:26.347
and we will stop you again.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.148
Of course you will.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.651
How could any villain
stand against such
a formidable team?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.255
Are you making
fun of us, dude?

02:34.355 --> 02:37.458
Why would I make fun
of the most amazing
superhero team of all time?

02:37.558 --> 02:39.593
Yep, definitely making
fun of us.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.562
I mean it sincerely when I say

02:41.662 --> 02:43.564
you're a well-oiled crime
fighting machine.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.166
He does have a point, we could
work together better.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.902
This is exactly why we need
those mandatory meetings.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.306
I'm trying to say your
teamwork is your
greatest strength,

02:52.406 --> 02:54.542
which is how I came
up with my latest plan.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.179
This device will amplify
my mind control powers,

02:59.280 --> 03:03.584
allowing me to erase every
memory you have ever had
together as the Teen Titans.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.487
No team, no one to stop me.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.389
Jump City will be mine!

03:10.291 --> 03:11.759
We'll never let you, Blood.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.487
Every moment you've spent
building the Teen Titans

03:39.587 --> 03:41.655
into what they are
is gone, Robin.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.857
Do you know what that means?

03:43.957 --> 03:45.893
I get a do-over!

03:45.993 --> 03:48.629
This time everyone will
respect me as a leader.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.665
And no one will ever make fun
of my baby hands again.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.801
This is the best
evil plan ever.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.936
Ooh. That's not exactly
what I was going for.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.771
Thank you, thank you, so much!

03:57.871 --> 03:59.540
Mwah, mwah, mwah,
mwah, mwah, mwah.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.642
Okay, that's enough!

04:01.742 --> 04:02.976
Really appreciate it.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.848
Finally a fresh start.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.384
This time I'll make such
a great first impression

04:10.484 --> 04:11.785
that they'll have
to respect me.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.522
Teen Titans' first mandatory
meeting starts...

04:14.622 --> 04:15.923
I didn't say now.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.491
Now!

04:17.591 --> 04:19.660
Uh, what's going on, bro?

04:19.760 --> 04:22.296
How did I get into this large
letter shaped building?

04:22.396 --> 04:23.431
I don't like this.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.735
Don't panic, you're just
a little confused

04:27.835 --> 04:29.937
because all of your
memories were erased.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.272
My name is Robin

04:32.373 --> 04:33.907
and I am your leader.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.276
All I ask is for your
unconditional respect

04:36.377 --> 04:38.812
and admiration
and we will get through this.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.815
Okay, first order of business.

04:43.551 --> 04:46.654
What do you guys
think of my hands?

04:46.754 --> 04:47.921
-They're fine.
-They look good to me.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.691
-Seem normal.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.826
Excellent. The ray might have
affected your memory,

04:52.926 --> 04:55.028
but your minds are
as sharp as ever.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.067
Why is the orange girl
talking all funny?

05:00.167 --> 05:03.404
She has forgotten our language
and reverted back
to her native tongue.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.640
Well, what's she saying then?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.809
She's a...
She's just flirting with me.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.445
Where to start?

05:11.545 --> 05:12.880
Wait a minute.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.415
Why are you the leader?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.517
Because I'm the strongest.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.719
I've got all sorts of powers.

05:18.819 --> 05:23.524
In fact, I single handedly
formed the Teen Titans. Yes.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.759
Really? I don't remember that.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.762
That's because your memory
was erased, Beast Boy.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.431
Hmm.
I don't remember that either.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.999
Listen up, once upon a time,

05:32.099 --> 05:35.736
in a land far away,
but also right here.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.639
I built this great big
T-shaped tower

05:38.739 --> 05:41.475
with my super
powerful robot suit.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.077
But then,
I came across poor Cyborg

05:44.177 --> 05:47.014
who was destitute
and just a head.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.749
I let him borrow my suit

05:48.849 --> 05:50.584
so he could be
awesome like me.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.453
Oh, thanks!

05:52.553 --> 05:53.887
And you, Beast Boy.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.089
I found you abandoned on
the top of Mount Everest.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.759
And I fed you like
a baby bird,

05:58.859 --> 06:01.094
until you grew up big
and strong.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.530
Wow.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.598
So that's how I got
so big and strong.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.633
What about me?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.535
Ah, yes, Raven.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.470
Back then you were

06:09.570 --> 06:11.038
just a little purple blanket.

06:11.138 --> 06:14.041
I used my magical powers
to bring you to life.

06:14.141 --> 06:17.545
Wow, I used to be a blanket
and now I'm a real girl.

06:17.645 --> 06:18.579
Thanks, Robin.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.948
And finally, Starfire.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.716
She's my girlfriend, so,
you know,

06:22.816 --> 06:24.618
-kinda had to let her
be on the team.
-Oh.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.686
-I get it.
-Been there.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.057
That's...
That's so sweet.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.960
Uh, she was telling me how
handsome I look.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.628
Uh, yes, Raven.

06:35.929 --> 06:36.764
I want to say how much
I'm enjoying this
mandatory meeting.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.467
-Teach us more, Leader!
-Yeah, this rocks.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.469
Ah, you flatter me.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.170
Uh, what else?

06:43.270 --> 06:46.674
Ah, Starfire, did you know
that Tamaraneans can learn
any language

06:46.774 --> 06:48.075
through lip contact?

06:51.812 --> 06:54.014
* Remember the days when
we used to kiss

06:54.114 --> 06:56.684
* Now somewhat
outta rhythm... *

06:58.852 --> 07:00.954
I love you too, baby.

07:07.094 --> 07:11.965
-King Robin.
-No, Raven. You used to just
call me King to save time.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.201
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That sounds right.

07:14.301 --> 07:18.706
King, I was hoping you could
regale us with some more tales
of your awesomeness.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.774
More

07:20.874 --> 07:23.544
I've been telling you about
my awesomeness all day.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.445
Please? You're just so cool.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.716
And then, we can have a
mandatory meeting afterwards.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.954
Okay, okay,
since you asked so nicely.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.489
One dark day,

07:35.589 --> 07:36.957
in the not so distant past,

07:37.057 --> 07:39.627
an evil super villain
named Brother Blood

07:39.727 --> 07:42.996
captured you guys and locked
you in an inescapable cage,

07:43.096 --> 07:46.466
hanging over a volcano,
on the moon.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.535
-Whoa!

07:47.635 --> 07:48.569
That's incredible.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.737
Yes.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.238
I had to use my
ability of flight

07:51.338 --> 07:53.741
to soar all the way
up to the moon.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.478
Then I blasted Brother Blood
into oblivion

07:58.579 --> 07:59.880
with my heat vision eyes.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.151
I used my magical telepathic
thought waves

08:05.986 --> 08:08.822
to float you to safety.

08:08.922 --> 08:12.125
-Ooh! That was intense!
-Whoa! Thought waves!

08:12.225 --> 08:14.261
Could we have that mandatory
meeting now?

08:16.597 --> 08:17.898
Uh-oh.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.499
The mandatory meeting is going
to have to wait.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.804
Brother Blood is robbing
the Jump City Weapons Depot.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.181
ROBIN: Hello, Brother Blood.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.784
This time you're going
down for good!

08:37.317 --> 08:38.919
Titans, go!

08:39.019 --> 08:41.789
No way! We want to see
you fight, great leader.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.156
Yeah, go get him!

08:43.256 --> 08:45.726
Use your awesome heat vision
to obliterate him.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.695
Uh, right.
About that heat vision...

08:48.996 --> 08:49.930
Ooh.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.666
What are you
waiting for, King?

08:52.766 --> 08:55.168
Do some magic or something.
Aah!

08:58.205 --> 09:01.074
Ah, it's just you
and me now, Star.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.946
You want to hug me now, Robin?

09:06.914 --> 09:08.782
-Ow!

09:10.951 --> 09:12.552
Oh, this is my fault.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.021
-You're a great leader.

09:15.422 --> 09:18.291
The, uh...
The stories I told you,

09:18.391 --> 09:19.559
I made them up.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.162
I just wanted you
to respect me.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.597
Here's the truth.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.667
Cyborg, I never gave you your
awesome robot body.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.201
-No!
-ROBIN: And, Beast Boy,

09:28.301 --> 09:30.237
I never raised you
from a wee chick.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.705
It can't be true.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.707
ROBIN: Raven, you were never
a blanket.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.175
I don't believe it.

09:35.275 --> 09:39.246
ROBIN: And sadly, Starfire's
never been my girlfriend.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.082
But there's one thing that
might trigger your memories.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.853
Take a cold, hard look
at my hands.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.259
-That dude's got baby hands!
-Look at them.

09:52.359 --> 09:55.062
-Say what.
-They're so small and chubby.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.999
Yes, I am your leader

09:59.099 --> 10:00.968
and I have baby hands!

10:01.068 --> 10:02.269
Baby hands.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.041
-Raven!
-Starfire!

10:08.141 --> 10:10.010
-Cyborg!
-Beast Boy!

10:10.110 --> 10:12.145
Your memories have
been restored.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.246
Titans, go!

10:21.855 --> 10:23.023
Oh yeah!

10:23.123 --> 10:24.992
The Teen Titans are back
and better than ever.

10:25.092 --> 10:29.062
So, I guess that means
you're going to stop
listening to me again.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.766
Hey, we may not listen
to you sometimes.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.034
Or respect you.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.169
And, sure, we like
making fun of you.

10:38.906 --> 10:39.907
But...

10:40.007 --> 10:41.408
There is no but.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.843
That is all.
