00:19.586 --> 00:20.883
Ship is gray, Captain.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.444
We've cut power
to Decks 4 through 9.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.819
Replicators, holodecks,

00:23.890 --> 00:26.358
and all other nonessentials
are off-line.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.327
Remaining systems are operating
at 20 percent capacity.

00:29.396 --> 00:32.331
Tom, how long
can you keep us flying?

00:32.399 --> 00:34.492
With the deuterium supply
this low,

00:34.567 --> 00:36.228
even at one-quarter impulse,

00:36.302 --> 00:38.429
we'll be out of gas
inside a week.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.097
Everyone redouble your efforts.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.698
Keep your eyes open
for new sources of deuterium.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.404
Tuvok, Chakotay,
l want recommendations

00:45.478 --> 00:47.469
for further methods
of conservation.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.675
Harry, you and l will
give them a hand in Geophysics--

00:50.750 --> 00:53.719
see if we can't synthesize
a substitute fuel.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.812
ln the meantime,
we stay in gray mode.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.483
lf anybody's got
any other ideas, l'm listening.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.150
We could set up a bicycle

01:00.226 --> 01:03.354
in the Mess Hall,
attach a generator, pedal home.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.828
Now, why didn't l think of that?

01:04.897 --> 01:08.493
And l volunteer Harry
to take the first shift.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.798
Living space will
be extremely limited.

01:14.874 --> 01:18.970
Take only those personal items
which are absolutely essential.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.672
Hello, there!

01:24.684 --> 01:27.517
What, may l ask, is this?

01:27.587 --> 01:31.648
That, Mr. Vulcan,
is the Selected Works of Jirex.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.419
Only essential items,
Mr. Neelix.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.755
Oh, Jirex is essential.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.228
He's the greatest writer
in the Talaxian canon.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.559
l never go to sleep

01:38.631 --> 01:40.895
without reading at least
one of his parables.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.264
A habit you will have to break,

01:42.335 --> 01:44.565
until we're able to restore
power to crew quarters.

01:44.637 --> 01:46.832
l suppose l can try.

01:46.906 --> 01:49.033
And... these?

01:49.109 --> 01:52.510
l... l get terrible
neck pains without them.

01:52.579 --> 01:53.705
l suggest you ask the Doctor

01:53.780 --> 01:55.179
to prescribe
an anti-inflammatory.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.719
Oh, fine.
l don't mind roughing it.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.415
Mr. Neelix, the blankets.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.651
No. No, that's
where l draw the line.

02:05.725 --> 02:07.590
My mother
knitted these herself.

02:07.660 --> 02:10.094
l've slept with them
since l was a child.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.529
You'll have to make do
with standard-issue bedding.

02:12.599 --> 02:15.193
But those Starfleet blankets
give me a rash.

02:15.268 --> 02:16.826
Then l suggest you
ask the Doctor...

02:16.903 --> 02:18.165
For some anti-itch cream.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.865
l might as well sleep
in Sick Bay!

02:22.041 --> 02:25.909
Thank you, Mr. Vulcan.
You've just given me an idea.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.612
What's going on here?

02:35.688 --> 02:36.814
l'm working.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.120
You were ordered to shut down
Astrometrics an hour ago.

02:39.192 --> 02:40.921
We can't afford the power.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.985
Seven, it's inefficient.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.087
Efficiency is relative,
Commander.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.359
lf l shut down Astrometrics,

02:46.432 --> 02:48.400
l won't be able to scan
for new fuel sources.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.935
l appreciate your efforts,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.937
but we'll have to use
conventional scanners until...

02:57.076 --> 02:59.977
Conventional scanners
would not have found this.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.308
What?

03:01.381 --> 03:03.246
Highly concentrated deuterium.

03:03.316 --> 03:04.749
Where?

03:04.817 --> 03:06.876
Computer, display source.

03:06.953 --> 03:10.389
A planetoid .4 light-years
from our present position.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.890
There are dense
pockets of deuterium

03:12.959 --> 03:14.221
just beneath the surface.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.592
Maybe so, but that's
a Demon-class planet.

03:16.663 --> 03:17.925
Demon-class?

03:17.997 --> 03:19.726
That's what Starfleet calls it.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.266
Also known as Class-Y.

03:21.334 --> 03:22.824
lt's got a toxic atmosphere

03:22.902 --> 03:24.733
filled with
thermionic radiation.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.602
Surface temperatures are
in excess of 500 Kelvins.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.370
Just entering a standard
orbit would be suicide.

03:30.443 --> 03:31.501
Our situation is desperate.

03:31.578 --> 03:32.704
True.

03:32.779 --> 03:36.840
When faced with desperate
circumstances, we must adapt.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.586
Captain's Log, supplemental.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.563
l've ordered adaptations
to our shields

05:32.632 --> 05:35.066
to repel
the thermionic discharges.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.534
Hoping that the benefits
will outweigh the risks,

05:37.603 --> 05:39.366
we're now trying
to beam deuterium

05:39.439 --> 05:41.339
from beneath
the planet's surface.

05:41.407 --> 05:44.570
Narrow the annular confinement
beam to .47 terahertz.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.271
Ready here, Captain.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.438
Stand by.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.572
Harry, shunt whatever
additional power you can

05:49.649 --> 05:50.877
to the containment field.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.976
l don't want any of those
atmospheric gases seeping in.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.350
Aye, Captain.

05:55.421 --> 05:58.356
A thermionic discharge
has struck the forward shields.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.857
They're holding.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.019
Let's get this over with
before you tell me otherwise.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.356
Seven, do it.

06:03.396 --> 06:04.624
Energize.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.735
Transport in progress.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.403
Shields are weakening.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.169
l'm reading an overload
in the pattern buffers.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.504
Abort transport.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.908
Controls not responding!

06:18.978 --> 06:20.002
Get out of there now.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.576
Computer, seal off
the Transporter Room

06:26.652 --> 06:29.587
and erect
a level-10 containment field.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.350
Containment field established.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.421
The good news is
Nozawa and Seven of Nine

06:36.496 --> 06:39.021
have both been treated
and released from Sick Bay,

06:39.098 --> 06:40.929
and the planetary gases
have been expelled

06:41.000 --> 06:42.365
from the transporter room.

06:42.435 --> 06:43.697
And the bad news?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.237
The transporters are off-line.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.703
lt'll take days
before they're back again.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.401
Great. We lose valuable
energy on a course change,

06:49.475 --> 06:52.069
and all we get for our trouble
is another downed system.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.080
Can we send a probe
to collect the deuterium?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.843
lt would incinerate
within seconds

06:56.916 --> 06:58.577
of entering
the upper atmosphere.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.915
Then l don't see
any other options.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.285
Tom, put us back
on our original course.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.618
One-quarter impulse.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.453
Captain, maybe l can help.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.461
Harry, the bicycle thing
was just a joke.

07:09.529 --> 07:10.791
l've been thinking.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.831
With Tuvok's shield
modifications

07:12.899 --> 07:15.424
and a few tweaks
to an environmental suit,

07:15.501 --> 07:16.798
l could take a shuttle
to the surface

07:16.869 --> 07:18.598
and mine the deuterium
from there.

07:18.671 --> 07:21.606
Need l remind you, Ensign,
that there is no environment

07:21.674 --> 07:24.302
less hospitable to humanoid life
than a Class-Y.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.675
Actually, Tuvok, no,
you needn't remind me.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.611
What's the alternative?

07:28.681 --> 07:30.273
Resume course, creep
along at quarter-impulse

07:30.349 --> 07:31.543
hoping we'll find fuel

07:31.617 --> 07:33.084
before we end up
dead in the water?

07:33.152 --> 07:35.643
We've got deuterium
within arm's reach.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.279
We can't let the
opportunity slip away

07:37.356 --> 07:38.345
without at least trying.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.686
He's got a point.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.226
You wouldn't be able
to communicate with us

07:41.294 --> 07:42.522
if you got in trouble.

07:42.595 --> 07:43.926
And until
we can get transporters back,

07:43.996 --> 07:45.020
we couldn't beam you out.

07:45.097 --> 07:47.156
Even with modifications,

07:47.233 --> 07:49.667
it wouldn't be long before
your suit began to corrode.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.363
Exposure to that atmosphere
could kill you within minutes.

07:52.438 --> 07:53.871
l know the risks.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.306
Even if l agreed,
l'd never let you go alone.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.637
Of course not.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.699
That's why l'm volunteering

07:58.778 --> 08:00.268
my good buddy Tom
here to go with me.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.620
You were pretty forceful
in there.

08:08.688 --> 08:09.950
So?

08:10.022 --> 08:11.284
So? l don't think

08:11.357 --> 08:13.257
l've ever seen you
that assertive

08:13.326 --> 08:14.793
in a staff meeting before.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.954
You must be bucking
for a promotion.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.088
l had an idea
and l spoke up, that's all.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.156
Oh, no, no, no.
lt was more than that.

08:21.234 --> 08:24.465
You put Tuvok in his place,
right in front of everybody.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.198
He was stating
the obvious again.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.864
Talking down to me
like l didn't

08:27.940 --> 08:29.965
know anything
about Demon-class planets?

08:30.042 --> 08:31.566
l am not criticizing you.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.669
Believe me, nobody enjoys seeing

08:33.746 --> 08:36.909
the Vulcan master put down a peg
more than l do.

08:36.982 --> 08:39.349
l was just surprised,
that's all.

08:39.418 --> 08:40.851
Why?

08:40.919 --> 08:42.547
lt didn't seem like you.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.023
Good.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.759
Cargo Bay 2.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.320
You trying to change

08:52.398 --> 08:54.195
your squeaky-clean image
or something?

08:54.267 --> 08:56.235
Not exactly.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.167
What, then?

08:58.237 --> 08:59.966
How do l explain this?

09:02.408 --> 09:04.239
When l first
came on board Voyager,

09:04.310 --> 09:06.073
l was pretty green, right?

09:07.113 --> 09:10.241
A deep,
almost fluorescent green,

09:10.316 --> 09:12.181
if l remember correctly.

09:12.251 --> 09:15.778
l was young, inexperienced,
and l acted like it--

09:15.855 --> 09:19.018
nervous about giving my opinion,
hesitant to make suggestions--

09:19.091 --> 09:22.151
so l usually just
kept my mouth shut,

09:22.228 --> 09:24.594
and l behaved that way
for so long,

09:24.664 --> 09:26.325
it became a habit.

09:26.399 --> 09:30.961
But, in the last four years,
a lot has happened.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.437
l've fought the Borg,

09:33.506 --> 09:35.371
been transformed into an alien,

09:35.441 --> 09:36.772
helped defeat the Hirogen.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.605
Hell, l've even
come back from the dead.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.044
lt's been a wild ride.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.082
l woke up the other morning
and it suddenly hit me--

09:44.150 --> 09:46.550
l've got a lot
of experience now,

09:46.619 --> 09:47.916
so why should l be afraid

09:48.020 --> 09:51.615
to take the initiative
or voice my ideas?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.553
Good for you, Harry.

09:55.628 --> 09:56.595
But...

09:56.662 --> 09:57.924
do me a favor.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.022
The next time you try
to assert yourself,

10:00.099 --> 10:01.361
leave me out of it.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.696
l hate hot weather.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.133
Don't worry,
we can cut some holes

10:04.203 --> 10:06.865
in the environmental suits,
get some ventilation going.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.375
Harry, while you're
busy improving yourself,

10:10.443 --> 10:12.070
you might try working
on your sense of humor.

10:12.144 --> 10:13.406
My sense of humor?

10:13.479 --> 10:15.743
What about that stupid gag
about the bicycle?

10:15.815 --> 10:17.077
Oh, ho-ho!
That was funny.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.446
No, that was not funny.

10:18.517 --> 10:19.848
You think that's humor?

10:27.026 --> 10:28.425
l can't thank you enough

10:28.494 --> 10:29.984
for getting me in
on this mission, Harry.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.996
Don't mention it.

10:32.064 --> 10:33.998
Remind me
to volunteer you to help

10:34.066 --> 10:37.331
the next time l have to clean
the warp plasma manifolds.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.633
Really, Tom,
you don't owe me anything.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.297
Oh, but l do.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.568
We've lost attitude control.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.044
Time to show off
your piloting skills.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.705
Think you can handle it?

10:48.781 --> 10:50.681
Watch me.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.547
Oh, l'll be watching you,
all right.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.051
Switching to manual control.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.181
Just sit back, relax,
and enjoy the ride.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.993
We're entering
the lower atmosphere,

11:02.061 --> 11:04.052
approaching
the landing coordinates.

11:04.130 --> 11:07.361
All right.
l'm going to set us down.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.060
On my mark...

11:14.106 --> 11:15.971
Mark.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.010
You did that on purpose,
didn't you?

11:27.620 --> 11:31.078
lt's almost 500 degrees Kelvin.

11:31.157 --> 11:35.093
Don't worry.
The suits can handle it.

11:35.161 --> 11:39.120
lf not, we'll be human barbecue.

11:41.133 --> 11:45.126
l'm picking up
traces of deuterium...

11:45.204 --> 11:47.638
50 meters... that way.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.140
Let's move.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.641
No sweat.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.143
Lame.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.689
lt's coming from in here.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.525
What is it?

12:11.597 --> 12:14.862
Some kind of metallic
compound...

12:14.934 --> 12:18.028
highly viscous...

12:18.104 --> 12:20.504
and if these readings are right,

12:20.573 --> 12:23.406
its temperature
is only 12 degrees?!

12:23.476 --> 12:25.137
ln this environment?!

12:25.211 --> 12:26.473
Whatever this stuff is,

12:26.545 --> 12:28.570
it's packed
with liquefied deuterium.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.908
Jackpot.

12:29.982 --> 12:31.244
There's another pool

12:31.317 --> 12:32.147
20 meters that way.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.583
Why don't you go check it out

12:33.652 --> 12:35.347
while l collect
a few samples here.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.513
Right.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.786
l don't know, Harry...

12:39.859 --> 12:42.259
a couple of lounge chairs,

12:42.328 --> 12:44.762
a big beach umbrella,

12:44.830 --> 12:47.230
maybe some dermalplast to
counteract the chemical burns,

12:47.299 --> 12:49.961
and l think we've found
ourselves a new vacation spot.

12:52.404 --> 12:53.462
Aw, come on.

12:53.539 --> 12:54.506
That was a little funny.

12:54.573 --> 12:55.835
Let me hear you do better.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.512
Harry?

13:07.553 --> 13:09.043
Harry!

13:16.695 --> 13:18.424
Oh, my God.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.772
l know it's hot out, Harry,

13:35.848 --> 13:38.578
but you picked a lousy time
to go for a swim.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.710
l don't know what happened.

13:40.786 --> 13:43.346
l leaned over
to collect a sample

13:43.422 --> 13:45.913
and it was like l was pulled in.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.424
Warning. Ensign Kim,

13:47.493 --> 13:50.656
an environmental seal
has been compromised.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.788
Oxygen depletion in 30 seconds.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.124
Hang in there, buddy,

13:57.203 --> 13:59.535
and l'll get you back
to the shuttle.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.008
Have you put on weight?

14:03.075 --> 14:04.372
You're just out of shape.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.569
Warning.

14:05.644 --> 14:09.171
Oxygen depletion in 15 seconds.

14:09.248 --> 14:11.682
l'll make you a deal--
you hold your breath

14:11.750 --> 14:12.842
till we get back
to the shuttle,

14:12.918 --> 14:15.011
and l promise l'll start
exercising every day.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.783
Maybe you should start
with the bicycle.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.290
l thought l told you
to hold your breath.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.425
Warning. Oxygen depletion
in five seconds.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.534
Hang in there, Harry.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.069
We'll make it.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.836
Warning. Lieutenant Paris,

14:34.907 --> 14:37.535
an environmental seal
has been compromised.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.805
Oxygen depletion in 30 seconds.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.772
You gotta be kidding me.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.644
We're in the same boat now,
buddy,

14:48.721 --> 14:50.348
but l'll get us out of this.

14:51.557 --> 14:55.118
Warning.
Oxygen depletion in 15 seconds.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.487
You're right.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.896
l definitely need
to get back in shape.

15:00.966 --> 15:04.595
Warning. Oxygen depletion
in five seconds.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.352
Out of the question.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.854
Be reasonable, Doctor.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.652
Take it up
with Commander Chakotay.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.248
He's on his way
here right now.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.055
But it's only
for a couple of days.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.824
Just until we get power back
in the crew quarters.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.161
l suggest you set up camp
in the Mess Hall.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.427
The Mess Hall is full.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.230
Where are we
supposed to sleep?

15:37.303 --> 15:38.327
Anywhere but here.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.235
This is a Sick Bay,
not a dormitory.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.274
But you have four empty beds.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.172
Bio-beds, reserved for patients.

15:44.243 --> 15:44.971
You don't have any patients.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.602
l may have one in a moment,

15:46.679 --> 15:49.341
if you and your fellow squatters
don't go elsewhere.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.178
You wanted to see me, Doctor?

15:51.250 --> 15:52.342
Oh, it's about time.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.477
Mr. Neelix is attempting
to turn my Sick Bay

15:54.553 --> 15:55.542
into a flophouse.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.986
We are short on beds for now.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.078
We've got to adapt.

15:58.157 --> 15:58.953
Aha.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.616
But what if there's

16:00.693 --> 16:02.490
a medical emergency?

16:02.561 --> 16:04.586
Then Neelix and the others
will get out of the way.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.096
Absolutely.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.725
But... this isn't just Sick Bay.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.268
lt's my residence.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.669
And we promise to be
the most perfect houseguests.

16:13.739 --> 16:15.229
What more can you ask for?

16:15.307 --> 16:16.274
But...

16:16.342 --> 16:17.866
l have a routine.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.207
l'm a night owl.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.541
What if one of them should snore

16:21.613 --> 16:22.910
while l'm listening to Puccini?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.075
Well, if you feel
that strongly about it, Doc,

16:25.150 --> 16:27.311
l suppose we'll have to consider
other options.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.081
Thank you, Commander.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.247
For example, we could
shut down your program

16:31.323 --> 16:32.290
until you're needed.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.258
The Captain asked me
to look for ways

16:34.326 --> 16:36.556
to conserve power,
and it would spare you

16:36.628 --> 16:38.425
from having to listen
to them snore.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.124
Commander Chakotay
to the Bridge.

16:40.199 --> 16:41.325
On my way.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.458
But...

16:46.772 --> 16:48.933
Make yourselves at home.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.101
Try scanning
for infrared signatures.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.838
There's too much interference.

16:53.912 --> 16:54.844
What's up?

16:54.913 --> 16:56.380
Tom and Harry
still aren't back.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.541
You want me to take another
shuttle down and look for them?

16:58.617 --> 17:00.141
And risk losing you, too?

17:00.219 --> 17:03.655
Either we keep waiting
until we run out or deuterium

17:03.722 --> 17:05.416
and get trapped in orbit, or...

17:05.491 --> 17:06.423
Or?

17:06.492 --> 17:07.720
We land the ship.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.090
As you know, Captain,
the landing procedure

17:10.162 --> 17:12.255
requires a significant
output of energy.

17:12.330 --> 17:13.763
With shield strength
as low as it is,

17:13.832 --> 17:14.799
we can't even be certain

17:14.867 --> 17:15.834
the ship will survive
the descent.

17:15.901 --> 17:16.867
What's the alternative?

17:16.969 --> 17:19.028
We're up here,
the deuterium's down there,

17:19.104 --> 17:20.401
and we're stuck without it.

17:20.472 --> 17:22.234
We've come this far.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.104
Janeway to Engineering.

17:24.175 --> 17:26.166
Vent all plasma
from the nacelles.

17:26.244 --> 17:29.544
Transfer any available power
to atmospheric thrusters

17:29.615 --> 17:31.810
and stand by
to commence landing sequence.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.908
Acknowledged, Captain.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.681
Commander Chakotay,
take the conn.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.916
Tom's going to be sorry
he missed this.

17:39.024 --> 17:39.922
Code Blue.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.515
Commander Tuvok to all hands.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.582
Go to Blue Alert

17:42.661 --> 17:44.788
and report
to Code Blue stations.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.093
Atmospheric controls at standby.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.758
Landing struts on line.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.802
lnertial dampers at maximum.

17:50.869 --> 17:53.167
All operative decks report
Condition Blue.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.069
Let us down easy, Commander.

18:05.217 --> 18:07.208
We're on
a declining glide trajectory.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.811
Altitude 150 kilometers.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.220
A thermionic discharge.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.316
Shields down to 81 percent.

18:17.896 --> 18:20.456
Shields at 43 percent.

18:20.532 --> 18:21.362
Chakotay.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.663
l think we're through
the worst of it.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.498
Almost.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.300
Shields at 22 percent
and falling.

18:27.372 --> 18:28.862
Can you shore them up?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.273
Negative. There's
no more available power.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.106
Engaging landing struts.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.614
Brace for impact!

18:47.893 --> 18:49.019
Status?

18:49.094 --> 18:52.257
l could give you a litany
of damaged systems, Captain,

18:52.331 --> 18:54.322
but suffice it to say,
now that we're down,

18:54.399 --> 18:55.923
we won't be going up again soon.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.663
Start organizing repair crews.

19:00.239 --> 19:03.072
Well, that was very good,
Commander.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.667
Take an away team
and find Harry and Tom.

19:17.189 --> 19:19.953
Chakotay... you're going out
to look for them, aren't you?

19:20.025 --> 19:21.424
-That's right.
-Take me with you.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.653
l can't do that, B'Elanna.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.218
You're needed here
to complete repairs.

19:24.296 --> 19:25.957
l've already handed
out assignments.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.123
Vorik's on top of it.

19:27.199 --> 19:28.757
l want to help you find them.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.029
Look... l know you're
concerned about Tom and Harry.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.161
We all are.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.228
l'll have them back
safe and sound in no time.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.273
Don't patronize me.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.308
We both know how dangerous
that environment is.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.775
They could be
in serious trouble.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.674
You're right.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.372
l don't know
what we're going to find.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.779
That's why l need cool heads.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.112
You think l can't
control myself?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.379
l think you're a little
too close to this.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.851
You're damn right l am.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.786
lf someone you loved
was missing on this planet,

19:50.856 --> 19:52.983
you would be the first one
out that door, and you know it.

19:53.158 --> 19:54.887
B'Elanna, the clock is ticking.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.087
Go back to Engineering,
do your job,

19:57.162 --> 19:58.891
and let me do mine.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.329
Do me a favor.

20:00.399 --> 20:01.832
What?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.629
Take Seven of Nine with you.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.095
You're recommending her?

20:07.172 --> 20:09.265
You said you needed cool heads,
didn't you?

20:09.341 --> 20:11.036
Nobody's head is cooler
than hers.

20:13.278 --> 20:14.267
All right.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.016
And bring them back safe.

20:21.253 --> 20:22.720
l will.

20:41.807 --> 20:42.831
Excuse me, Doctor.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.000
Yes, Mr. Neelix?

20:44.076 --> 20:46.374
We'd like to sleep now,
if you don't mind.

20:46.445 --> 20:47.377
Not at all.

20:47.446 --> 20:48.879
Make yourselves comfortable.

20:48.947 --> 20:51.177
But you seem busy.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.308
Oh, don't mind me.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.045
Just going about my routine.

20:54.119 --> 20:56.417
Sleep away.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.291
What about the lights?

21:02.361 --> 21:03.293
What about them?

21:03.362 --> 21:04.693
Could we turn them off?

21:04.763 --> 21:07.254
You don't expect me to work
in the dark, do you?

21:07.332 --> 21:08.526
Well, no,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.329
but l'll never be able
to fall asleep.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.563
That's not my problem, is it?

21:12.638 --> 21:16.574
l've got a very, very
busy day tomorrow

21:16.642 --> 21:19.907
and my next shift is
just four hours away.

21:19.978 --> 21:20.945
Perhaps you should've
thought of that

21:21.013 --> 21:22.776
when choosing
your accommodations.

21:22.848 --> 21:25.146
Well, if we can't sleep,

21:25.217 --> 21:29.847
l guess we'll just have
to find some other way

21:29.921 --> 21:31.980
to pass the time.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.719
How about a sing-along?

21:35.794 --> 21:39.457
l could teach you all
some Talaxian rondos,

21:39.531 --> 21:41.931
and l know
a Vulcan funeral dirge,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.662
not to mention
the classics of Klingon opera.

21:46.705 --> 21:49.230
Very well, Mr. Neelix, you win.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.275
Pleasant dreams.

21:54.913 --> 21:57.279
Computer, lights off.

22:19.304 --> 22:21.738
You're a little jumpy,
aren't you?

22:21.807 --> 22:23.331
l thought l heard something.

22:23.408 --> 22:26.343
Now you know why they
call it Demon-class.

22:26.411 --> 22:28.936
Demon implies a presence.

22:29.081 --> 22:32.209
This planetoid is unoccupied.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.650
l'm picking up the shuttlecraft.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.623
Nobody home.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.599
lt's unlikely
their environmental suits

22:49.668 --> 22:52.000
were able to survive
the elements for this long.

22:52.070 --> 22:53.935
l hope you're wrong.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.796
Looks like they went this way.

23:22.868 --> 23:25.598
My tricorder isn't picking up
any life signs.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.365
How did you reach
that conclusion?

23:27.439 --> 23:28.463
Footprints.

23:32.544 --> 23:35.604
l guess you never assimilated
any lndian scouts.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.431
High concentrations
of deuterium...

23:57.502 --> 23:59.629
coming from this fluid.

23:59.704 --> 24:01.501
l'll collect a sample.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.748
Let's find Tom and Harry first.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.685
We'll collect
the deuterium later.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.518
As you wish.

24:34.039 --> 24:37.668
Maybe they found
some shelter inside.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.614
Commander!

25:03.969 --> 25:07.063
Good to see you guys.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.972
Welcome to the Demon Planet.

25:24.589 --> 25:27.353
Our suits were corroding,
our lungs were burning--

25:27.425 --> 25:28.551
we were suffocating!

25:28.627 --> 25:29.924
You know what they say

25:29.995 --> 25:31.929
about your life
passing before your eyes?

25:31.997 --> 25:33.259
Well, it's true.

25:33.331 --> 25:34.923
l was finally
getting past puberty

25:35.000 --> 25:38.094
when suddenly,
l lost consciousness.

25:38.169 --> 25:40.569
l don't know how long
l was out, but...

25:40.639 --> 25:42.766
the next thing l knew,
l was awake

25:42.841 --> 25:45.867
and...
and l was breathing normally

25:45.944 --> 25:47.571
and l looked over at Harry.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.773
He was breathing normally, too--

25:49.848 --> 25:51.076
with his helmet off--

25:51.149 --> 25:53.617
and-and we just looked
at each other,

25:53.685 --> 25:55.550
and we just started laughing.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.212
l know it sounds crazy,

25:57.289 --> 26:00.486
but... it was
an exhilarating experience.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.789
His vital signs are normal.

26:02.861 --> 26:05.853
Apparently, he has adapted.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.261
Just the same, we'd better

26:07.332 --> 26:08.856
let the Doctor
take a look at you.

26:08.967 --> 26:10.093
Chakotay to Voyager.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.533
l've already tried that.

26:11.603 --> 26:14.037
The com signal
can't get out of the caves.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.800
Then we'll call again
when we get back outside.

26:15.874 --> 26:18.342
l'm telling you, Chakotay,

26:18.410 --> 26:21.140
it was an amazing experience.

26:21.212 --> 26:24.272
lt-lt's like when you're a kid
who's afraid of the water,

26:24.349 --> 26:26.749
and you suddenly realize
that you can swim.

26:26.818 --> 26:27.910
Go ahead.

26:28.019 --> 26:29.782
Take your helmets off.
Try it.

26:29.854 --> 26:31.651
l'm glad
you're feeling all right,

26:31.723 --> 26:33.918
but none of us
should be taking any risks

26:33.992 --> 26:36.017
until we know
exactly what's going on.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.028
Don't tell me
that a big, tough guy like you

26:38.096 --> 26:39.825
is afraid of a little
poisoned atmosphere.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.490
Where's Harry?

26:41.566 --> 26:43.090
He's further inside the cave.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.102
We found a huge cache
of deuterium.

26:45.170 --> 26:48.139
Let's find him and get you two
back to the ship.

26:48.206 --> 26:49.503
Whatever you say, boss,

26:49.574 --> 26:52.475
but l'm telling you, we could
breathe this air forever.

27:04.189 --> 27:05.156
Lieutenant.

27:05.223 --> 27:06.383
Yes.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.484
We should have transporters
back on line within the hour.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.392
Well, that's great,
but, right now,

27:11.463 --> 27:13.488
l'm more concerned
with little things,

27:13.565 --> 27:16.159
like, oh, l don't know,
say, life support?

27:16.234 --> 27:18.099
lndeed.
According to my calculations,

27:18.169 --> 27:20.501
environmental systems
will cease to function

27:20.572 --> 27:21.698
in two hours.

27:21.773 --> 27:23.570
You say that
like you're giving me

27:23.642 --> 27:24.768
the weather report.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.310
Well, l agree
the situation is dire,

27:26.378 --> 27:28.676
but losing our cool
will not help matters.

27:29.714 --> 27:31.841
Losing our cool?

27:31.916 --> 27:33.440
Where did you pick up
that expression?

27:33.618 --> 27:34.676
Mr. Paris.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.556
Well, there's hope for you yet.

27:38.623 --> 27:40.591
Now, how about giving me a hand?

27:54.005 --> 27:55.836
Harry.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.033
Commander.

27:57.108 --> 27:58.268
lsn't it incredible?

27:58.343 --> 28:00.811
That's what l've been
trying to tell them.

28:00.912 --> 28:02.539
Are you feeling okay, Harry?

28:02.580 --> 28:03.638
Never better.

28:03.715 --> 28:06.115
lf we could get some mobile
transporters down here,

28:06.184 --> 28:07.412
we could mine enough deuterium

28:07.485 --> 28:09.544
to get us all the way to the
Alpha Quadrant and back again.

28:09.621 --> 28:12.146
Tom tells me you've already
picked up 20 kilos.

28:12.223 --> 28:15.192
That should be enough to get
the main systems back on line.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.194
Let's get back to the ship;
have the Doctor take

28:17.262 --> 28:18.229
a look at you.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.786
l'd rather stay here
and keep working,

28:19.864 --> 28:21.024
if it's all the same to you.

28:21.099 --> 28:22.191
lt's not.

28:22.267 --> 28:23.757
Really, Commander, l'm fine.

28:23.835 --> 28:26.360
You should send some more
personnel out to help.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.668
They won't even need
environmental suits.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.469
l appreciate your enthusiasm,

28:30.542 --> 28:32.908
but we're going back
to Voyager-- now.

28:32.977 --> 28:33.909
lt's all right, Harry.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.503
Once the Doc takes a look at us
and sees we're fine,

28:36.581 --> 28:39.482
we'll get right back to work.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.711
Status, Mr. Tuvok.

28:40.785 --> 28:43.481
l've shut down life support
everywhere but Decks 1 and 5.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.544
lt should provide us

28:44.622 --> 28:45.884
with an extra hour
of breathable air.

28:45.957 --> 28:47.049
Chakotay to Voyager.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.353
Janeway here.

28:48.426 --> 28:49.723
We found Tom and Harry.

28:49.794 --> 28:51.489
First good news
l've had all day.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.495
What about the deuterium?

28:52.564 --> 28:53.656
We've got a few kilos.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.563
We're on our way back
to Voyager now.

28:55.633 --> 28:56.565
What's your position?

28:56.634 --> 28:58.829
About two kilometers
from the ship.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.097
Captain...

29:00.205 --> 29:01.866
Transporters are
coming back on line.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.464
We should be able
to beam you back

29:03.541 --> 29:05.236
from that distance,
but it may take a few minutes.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.800
Have the Doctor standing by.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.779
l think he's going to want to
take a look at Tom and Harry.

29:22.193 --> 29:23.820
Computer, lights.

29:23.895 --> 29:25.487
Maximum illumination.

29:25.563 --> 29:28.157
Everybody up.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.825
Rise and shine, Mr. Neelix.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.163
What's going on?

29:31.236 --> 29:32.794
lt's checkout time.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.463
lt's the middle of the night.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.097
Medicine knows no time clock.

29:36.174 --> 29:39.735
l've got patients on the way and
there's no more room at the inn.

29:39.811 --> 29:42.041
Patients? ls somebody sick?

29:42.113 --> 29:45.173
l can't answer that until
l've examined them, now, can l?

29:45.250 --> 29:46.808
Examine who?

29:46.885 --> 29:49.547
Ensign Kim and Lieutenant Paris.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.555
ls there anything
l can do to help?

29:51.623 --> 29:54.558
Yes. You and your friends
can vacate the premises.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.560
Right. Move!
You heard the Doctor!

29:56.628 --> 29:58.892
This is an emergency evacuation!

29:58.963 --> 30:01.158
Move! Move!

30:01.232 --> 30:02.563
Move!

30:02.634 --> 30:03.760
Doctor...

30:03.835 --> 30:05.894
Yes.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.631
thanks for your hospitality,

30:07.705 --> 30:10.173
and if you ever need
a place to stay,

30:10.241 --> 30:11.640
my door's always open.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.982
Energizing.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.360
Beam Tom and Harry to Sick Bay.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.133
What happened to them?

30:44.209 --> 30:46.734
As soon as we beamed aboard,
they started suffocating.

30:46.811 --> 30:48.642
Computer, erect
a level-7 force field

30:48.713 --> 30:49.907
around bio-beds 1 and 2.

30:49.981 --> 30:51.039
Force field established.

30:51.115 --> 30:52.047
What are you doing?

30:52.150 --> 30:54.209
Filling the area
inside the force field

30:54.285 --> 30:56.583
with the atmospheric gases
from the planet.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.679
Try to breathe normally now.

30:58.756 --> 31:00.951
Easy, or you'll hyperventilate.

31:03.261 --> 31:05.559
Slowly, in and out.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.190
ln... and out.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.730
Captain's Log, supplemental.

31:13.805 --> 31:17.070
The Doctor continues
to investigate Tom and Harry

31:17.141 --> 31:20.508
whose condition seems
as serious as it is strange.

31:20.578 --> 31:22.307
That stuff is in our blood?

31:22.380 --> 31:23.608
l'm afraid so.

31:23.681 --> 31:27.117
From what l can tell,
you've been bioformed.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.413
Bioformed?

31:28.486 --> 31:30.750
Think of it as the opposite
of terraforming.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.813
ln the same way we adapt
the environment of a planet

31:32.891 --> 31:36.486
to suit our needs,
this planet...

31:36.561 --> 31:37.755
has adapted you.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.319
How is that possible?

31:39.397 --> 31:41.922
This fluid somehow
entered your bloodstream

31:42.000 --> 31:43.991
and began altering
your physiology

31:44.068 --> 31:45.399
at the cellular level.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.870
l haven't had the time
to analyze the substance,

31:47.939 --> 31:48.997
but l hope to have
some answers soon.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.165
l'd like to run

31:50.241 --> 31:52.300
a few tests of my own,
if you don't mind.

31:52.377 --> 31:53.674
Of course.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.872
So, what's our prognosis, Doc?

31:55.947 --> 31:58.438
Well...

31:58.516 --> 32:00.484
you'll be fine.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.145
As long as you keep breathing
the planet's gases.

32:03.187 --> 32:06.884
You mean we have to stay
inside this force field?

32:06.958 --> 32:08.926
l'm afraid
it's worse than that.

32:08.993 --> 32:12.520
The atmosphere of this planet
can't be replicated safely.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.224
Which means...

32:14.299 --> 32:16.563
if we leave...

32:16.634 --> 32:19.125
we'll have nothing to breathe.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.568
Exactly.

32:20.638 --> 32:23.607
Either we find a way
to treat your condition...

32:25.643 --> 32:27.668
..or you'll have
to be left behind.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.992
Can the bioforming
process be reversed?

32:45.063 --> 32:46.325
As it stands,

32:46.397 --> 32:49.161
l don't know enough about
the phenomenon to undo it.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.758
l'll send Chakotay and
Seven back to the surface.

32:51.836 --> 32:54.202
They'll gather as much
information as they can.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.536
B'Elanna and l will start
running tests on this.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.598
Let me go with the away team,
Captain.

32:58.676 --> 33:00.234
l know the terrain.
l can help.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.744
Doctor?

33:01.779 --> 33:03.212
Right now, they're
better off out there

33:03.281 --> 33:04.509
than they are in here.

33:04.582 --> 33:06.311
But one of you will
have to remain,

33:06.384 --> 33:08.079
so l can monitor your condition.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.380
No problem.

33:09.454 --> 33:12.582
l volunteer Tom to stay here
and play guinea pig.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.459
Each square kilometer
of this planetoid

33:22.533 --> 33:24.865
is less appealing than the last.

33:26.237 --> 33:28.432
l think it's breathtaking.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.098
Breathtaking?

33:30.174 --> 33:31.471
Yes.

33:31.542 --> 33:34.943
Perhaps your recent experience
has impaired your perceptions.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.208
No, l don't think so.

33:37.281 --> 33:40.148
l wasn't really
seeing it before.

33:40.218 --> 33:41.947
Seeing what?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.544
The beauty.

33:43.621 --> 33:47.284
Would you care
to point out an example?

33:47.358 --> 33:49.553
Look over there.

33:49.627 --> 33:51.891
What do you see?

33:51.963 --> 33:54.397
l see monochromatic
geological formations,

33:54.465 --> 33:56.490
dust, haze.

33:56.567 --> 33:57.932
What do you see, Harry?

33:58.002 --> 34:00.698
To me,
those geological formations

34:00.772 --> 34:03.297
are a dozen shades
of red and gold.

34:03.374 --> 34:07.834
That dust-- it's glowing

34:07.912 --> 34:13.350
and the haze... it seems
to intensify the colors.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.909
l'm sorry.

34:15.987 --> 34:19.184
l know it's weird, but l feel
connected to this place.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.451
Connected how?

34:20.525 --> 34:22.686
l'm picking up
humanoid life signs.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.387
Location?

34:24.462 --> 34:26.554
100 meters this way.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.860
Magnify, factor 10.

34:35.039 --> 34:37.563
Deuterium, hydrogen sulfate,
dichromates.

34:37.641 --> 34:39.234
Add a little sodium chloride

34:39.310 --> 34:42.279
and it would probably taste
a lot like Neelix's soup.

34:42.346 --> 34:44.906
We should be so lucky.

34:44.982 --> 34:46.415
Oh, what's this?

34:46.484 --> 34:48.975
Magnify, factor 20.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.956
Captain?

34:56.194 --> 34:58.560
That's a protein molecule.

34:58.629 --> 35:00.290
This fluid has
organic properties.

35:00.398 --> 35:03.367
Let me see the sample that's
been treated with the reagents.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.669
Captain...

35:13.244 --> 35:15.109
Let's get you to Sick Bay.

35:15.179 --> 35:17.409
Wait.
That might not be necessary.

35:52.517 --> 35:53.984
Commander!

36:20.444 --> 36:21.911
Janeway to Bridge.
Report.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.004
A large pool
of the metallic compound

36:24.081 --> 36:25.605
is forming beneath the ship.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.014
We are sinking, Captain.

36:27.084 --> 36:28.517
On my way.
Get down to Engineering.

36:28.586 --> 36:29.314
Get thrusters on line.

36:29.387 --> 36:30.411
We're getting off this planet.

36:31.656 --> 36:33.521
l'm not sure how,
but they're still alive.

36:33.591 --> 36:35.252
Just barely.

36:35.326 --> 36:36.486
Tuvok to Chakotay.

36:36.561 --> 36:37.687
Go ahead.

36:37.762 --> 36:39.923
The Captain has ordered
an emergency ascent.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.794
We must bring you
back to the ship.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.493
Understood.
l've got five to beam back.

36:43.568 --> 36:44.626
Five?!

36:44.702 --> 36:47.193
We found another Paris and Kim.

36:47.271 --> 36:48.704
l can't explain it.

36:48.773 --> 36:50.832
l think l can.
Prepare for transport.

36:50.908 --> 36:52.569
Beam us directly to Sick Bay.

36:52.643 --> 36:53.940
No.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.376
l don't want to go back.

36:55.446 --> 36:56.606
Transporters are still
acting up.

36:56.681 --> 36:57.909
We can't get individual locks.

36:57.982 --> 37:00.143
We're going to have to grab you
in a wide beam,

37:00.251 --> 37:01.684
and bring you in as a group.

37:01.719 --> 37:02.777
Acknowledged.

37:05.256 --> 37:06.484
l belong here.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.785
Maybe so,

37:07.858 --> 37:09.587
but until we know
what's going on,

37:09.660 --> 37:11.287
you've got to come back
with us to the ship.

37:14.098 --> 37:14.996
Harry, no!

37:20.338 --> 37:22.738
Four of the away team
are in Sick Bay, Captain.

37:22.807 --> 37:25.105
l'm trying to get a lock
on the fifth.

37:25.176 --> 37:26.643
lt is Ensign Kim,

37:26.711 --> 37:29.145
or rather,
one of the Ensigns Kim.

37:29.213 --> 37:30.646
The ship is
continuing to sink.

37:30.715 --> 37:31.647
Then there's no time.

37:31.716 --> 37:32.705
We've got to get back
into orbit.

37:32.783 --> 37:33.750
We'll worry about Harry,

37:33.818 --> 37:35.308
or whoever he is, once we're up.

37:35.386 --> 37:37.820
Bring antigrav thrusters
on line.

37:37.888 --> 37:39.515
Thrusters enabled.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.854
lnertial dampers
to flight configuration.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.291
Dampers reconfigured.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.851
All stations report ready.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.022
lnitiating ascent.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.896
l need power to the thrusters.

37:49.967 --> 37:52.595
We are being restrained
by an electromagnetic force.

37:52.670 --> 37:53.728
Compensate.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.740
No effect.

37:56.807 --> 37:59.275
Decks 14 and 15 are submerged.

37:59.343 --> 38:01.174
The ship is continuing to sink.

38:13.190 --> 38:14.350
Report.

38:14.425 --> 38:16.188
Thrusters are off-line
due to an overload.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.660
Decks 13 through 15
are submerged.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.823
lf we don't lift off soon,
the hull will begin to corrode.

38:21.899 --> 38:23.298
Bridge to Engineering.

38:23.367 --> 38:24.356
Ensign Vorik here.

38:24.435 --> 38:25.732
l need thrusters back on line.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.293
Lieutenant Torres
has already sent a team

38:27.371 --> 38:28.599
to the thruster control
junction.

38:28.673 --> 38:29.605
How long?

38:29.674 --> 38:30.868
At least a half an hour.

38:31.008 --> 38:33.408
Even if thrusters are repaired,
they

38:33.477 --> 38:35.502
won't be of much use
if we sink any deeper.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.742
There must be some way
to disperse it.

38:40.217 --> 38:43.084
Try a nadion burst
from the phaser emitters.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.781
lt may weaken the
electromagnetic properties

38:44.855 --> 38:45.844
of the fluid.

38:45.923 --> 38:46.912
Aye, Captain.

38:47.024 --> 38:49.754
l'm on my way to Sick Bay
to check on Harry and Tom.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.192
You've got the Bridge.

39:00.304 --> 39:01.635
How are they?

39:01.706 --> 39:04.607
Lucky. The backup systems
in their environmental suits

39:04.675 --> 39:06.438
kept their
vital functions going.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.478
lt'll take time,
but they'll recover.

39:08.546 --> 39:09.740
And him?

39:09.814 --> 39:11.372
Aside from his ability

39:11.449 --> 39:13.815
to breathe the rarefied air
on this planet,

39:13.884 --> 39:15.852
he's the exact duplicate
of Mr. Paris.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.854
He even seems to share
his memories,

39:17.922 --> 39:19.947
not to mention
his winning personality.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.389
B'Elanna and l discovered

39:21.459 --> 39:23.654
that the fluid
has mimetic properties.

39:23.728 --> 39:25.821
Somehow, it reads the DNA

39:25.896 --> 39:28.160
of whatever
it comes in contact with

39:28.232 --> 39:30.097
and re-creates it.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.134
Fascinating.

39:36.407 --> 39:38.500
Can you tell me who you are?

39:38.576 --> 39:40.874
Please... just let me go back.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.106
Not until l find out
why two of my crew

39:43.180 --> 39:44.477
have been duplicated.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.413
Captain, you have to believe me.

39:46.484 --> 39:49.180
l don't know any more
than you do about this.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.915
Until he showed up,
l thought l was Tom Paris.

39:51.989 --> 39:54.753
A little changed by my
experience on the planet maybe,

39:54.825 --> 39:57.191
but now l don't know
who or what l am.

39:57.261 --> 40:00.025
All l know is that
l have to get off this ship

40:00.097 --> 40:02.190
and go back down
to the surface.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.598
We're ready to try
the nadion burst, Captain.

40:04.668 --> 40:05.760
Do it.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.037
What are you doing?!

40:10.107 --> 40:12.200
Captain, we're receiving
an urgent hail.

40:12.276 --> 40:15.143
lt's from Ensign Kim--
the one on the surface.

40:15.212 --> 40:16.179
Put him through.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.714
Captain, please!

40:17.782 --> 40:19.306
Stop what you're doing!

40:19.383 --> 40:22.113
lf you really do have
Harry Kim's memories,

40:22.186 --> 40:23.881
you know that l'm going to do
whatever it takes

40:23.954 --> 40:25.649
to get this ship back in orbit.

40:25.723 --> 40:26.985
You can't do that!

40:27.057 --> 40:28.149
Why not?

40:28.225 --> 40:31.388
l... l'm not sure
l understand it myself.

40:31.462 --> 40:34.727
Well, then you're going to have
to help me figure it out.

40:34.799 --> 40:37.927
Mr. Tuvok, l'm on my way
to Transporter Room 1.

40:38.002 --> 40:41.165
Erect a level-7 force field
around the platform.

40:41.238 --> 40:43.706
Fill it with atmosphere
from the planet

40:43.774 --> 40:47.505
and then beam Mr. Kim,
or rather his duplicate, aboard.

40:47.578 --> 40:48.636
Aye, Captain.

40:55.019 --> 40:56.043
Do you have a lock on him?

40:56.120 --> 40:57.052
Yes, ma'am.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.088
Energize.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.922
Release my vessel.

41:05.029 --> 41:05.927
We can't do that.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.759
''We''?

41:07.832 --> 41:12.895
The planet and l,
we're connected somehow.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.062
l can't explain it, Captain.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.332
l only know
that you've got to stop.

41:15.406 --> 41:16.771
And l'm willing to stop,

41:16.841 --> 41:19.173
but l'll say it again:
release the ship.

41:19.243 --> 41:21.507
No. We need you.

41:21.579 --> 41:23.809
Janeway to Tuvok.
Fire.

41:30.087 --> 41:31.315
What are you?

41:31.388 --> 41:32.980
Stop. No.

41:33.057 --> 41:33.921
l'll fire again.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.117
You're killing us.

41:35.292 --> 41:36.452
You're leaving me no choice.

41:36.527 --> 41:38.119
lt's not fair. lt's wrong!

41:38.195 --> 41:39.492
Janeway to Tuvok...

41:39.563 --> 41:41.087
No!

41:41.165 --> 41:42.792
No, no, no.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.665
Please... no more.

41:45.736 --> 41:46.828
Hold your fire, Tuvok.

41:46.904 --> 41:48.929
Captain, we are continuing
to submerge.

41:49.006 --> 41:49.938
Hold your fire.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.440
Acknowledged.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.976
l want some answers.

41:53.043 --> 41:56.479
l'm trying to understand.

41:56.547 --> 41:58.447
This is hard for me as well.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.882
You said you have
a connection to this planet.

42:00.985 --> 42:02.816
You talk about it
like it's alive.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.150
Alive?

42:06.457 --> 42:09.085
Yes...

42:09.159 --> 42:10.786
but not the planet.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.291
The silver blood.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.926
The compound that sampled
Harry's DNA...

42:18.002 --> 42:20.061
and created you.

42:20.137 --> 42:24.597
Yes... but it's never been
conscious, never sentient

42:24.675 --> 42:27.803
before now...
before me and the other.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.175
Tom Paris.

42:29.246 --> 42:30.645
We're the first.

42:30.714 --> 42:31.703
Don't you see?

42:31.782 --> 42:32.749
You came here.

42:32.816 --> 42:34.113
You showed us.

42:34.184 --> 42:38.814
When the compound came in
contact with Tom and Harry,

42:38.889 --> 42:42.325
it experienced awareness
for the first time.

42:42.393 --> 42:46.557
Before, it was only instinct--

42:46.630 --> 42:48.621
sound and light and heat.

42:50.868 --> 42:54.702
But those two...
showed us thought.

42:54.772 --> 42:56.967
l'm beginning to understand.

43:00.210 --> 43:03.304
This silver blood...

43:03.380 --> 43:06.679
experienced sentience...

43:06.750 --> 43:09.719
and now you want more.

43:09.787 --> 43:13.314
You want to duplicate
the rest of this crew

43:13.390 --> 43:15.324
and populate this planet.

43:15.392 --> 43:18.156
You're trying so hard
to reach home, but...

43:18.228 --> 43:19.820
this can be home.

43:19.897 --> 43:22.092
Not for me
and not for my people.

43:22.166 --> 43:24.794
Do you understand
why we can't stay here?

43:26.070 --> 43:27.731
l think so.

43:29.573 --> 43:32.041
Well, then release us.

43:32.109 --> 43:34.077
We'd rather die than be alone.

43:36.647 --> 43:39.081
We deserve life.

43:45.189 --> 43:47.521
This silver blood
that created you...

43:50.461 --> 43:53.453
...it duplicated Harry
without killing him.

43:56.133 --> 43:59.432
So you don't need our bodies...

43:59.503 --> 44:01.403
only samples of DNA.

44:07.444 --> 44:10.413
Release Voyager...

44:10.481 --> 44:12.745
and l'll speak to my crew.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.579
And if they're willing,

44:14.652 --> 44:17.177
l'll let you duplicate
the rest of us.

44:18.956 --> 44:20.116
Bridge to Janeway.

44:20.190 --> 44:21.316
We've stopped, Captain.

44:21.392 --> 44:22.552
We're no longer submerging.

44:22.626 --> 44:24.287
Understood.

44:24.361 --> 44:25.453
We're getting out of here,
Tuvok,

44:25.529 --> 44:29.431
but first, assemble the crew
in Cargo Bay 1,

44:29.500 --> 44:31.627
and have the Doctor
meet me there.

44:31.702 --> 44:32.566
Captain...?

44:32.636 --> 44:33.603
l'll explain later.

44:38.642 --> 44:41.133
lt's time to meet
your new family.

44:48.052 --> 44:50.077
All stations report
ready for liftoff.

44:50.154 --> 44:51.917
Code Blue status confirmed.

44:51.989 --> 44:53.422
Take us up, Mr. Paris.

44:53.490 --> 44:54.787
Aye, Captain.
