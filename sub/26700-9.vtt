WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.836
Previously on Legacies...
We need to learn more

00:02.836 --> 00:05.506
about Landon's past.
Who are your parents?

00:05.506 --> 00:08.141
My mom's name is Seylah.
Pretty much all I know.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.910
She gave me up for adoption
when I was young.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.812
I don't even know your name.
Landon.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.680
That's a beautiful one.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.482
Pretty sure you gave it to me.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.518
CLARKE:
What happened here?

00:17.518 --> 00:18.552
MAN:
Unscheduled absorption.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.987
Any idea who it was?

00:19.987 --> 00:23.023
Of course not,
but I did find this.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.460
What I don't understand is why I
can't remember how we found you.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.128
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

00:28.128 --> 00:29.563
What brought this on?

00:29.563 --> 00:31.031
I'm really happy
that you're back.

00:31.031 --> 00:35.002
I can lie to Landon about
all of this, but I'm sorry.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.571
Dr. Saltzman, I just
can't lie to you.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.773
I take it that's the urn
I don't remember.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.775
I figured it was better
to have it here

00:41.775 --> 00:43.777
than to leave it laying around.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.178
So what happens now?

00:45.178 --> 00:47.614
I think we're about to find out.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.393
No record of any employee
named Seylah.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.128
You sure she worked here?

01:07.167 --> 01:08.635
I can't think
of any other reason

01:08.635 --> 01:09.836
she'd have our logo
around her neck.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.577
I need access
to the backup archive.

01:16.577 --> 01:20.514
Access requires a password
only granted to employees

01:20.514 --> 01:22.883
with the highest level
security clearance.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.685
Takes longer than
a couple months here

01:24.685 --> 01:26.119
to work up to that, young buck.

01:26.119 --> 01:30.991
Echo four-seven-seven
Kilo Foxtrot Victor.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.734
That wasn't so hard, was it?

02:13.567 --> 02:16.903
Absorption date?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.107
If you went into the pit
20 years ago,

02:20.107 --> 02:21.875
how the hell
were you here last night?

02:21.875 --> 02:23.276
SECURITY GUARD:
You all right back there?

02:26.413 --> 02:30.150
Find what you're looking for?

02:30.150 --> 02:33.887
No. I guess I was wrong.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.089
First time
for everything, right?

02:36.089 --> 02:38.191
I'll show you out.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.216
(woman whispering)

03:11.358 --> 03:13.493
(woman whispering)

03:21.768 --> 03:23.637
(whispering continues)

03:31.445 --> 03:35.182
(whispering continues)

03:49.362 --> 03:51.798
(shrieking)

03:51.798 --> 03:53.967
(screaming)

03:56.069 --> 03:58.338
CHILD 1:
It's just a bad dream, Pedro.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.807
CHILD 2:
Go to sleep, Pedro.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.075
How long do you think it'll be

04:02.075 --> 04:04.244
before the next
monster shows up?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.346
It's hard to say.

04:06.346 --> 04:09.049
I've never actually seen
an artifact glow before.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.118
Where did you hide the urn,
by the way?

04:11.118 --> 04:15.021
I'm not sure I should tell you.
Excuse me?

04:15.021 --> 04:17.324
Isn't it safer if only one of us
knows where it is?

04:17.324 --> 04:19.226
Then that one of us
should be the adult.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.761
Funny, because I thought
it should be the one of us

04:21.761 --> 04:22.996
with high-level superpowers.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.364
What do we tell
everyone else?

04:24.364 --> 04:26.867
We should probably warn them

04:26.867 --> 04:28.902
before a cyclops
crashes exam week.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.672
It's usually best to start

04:32.672 --> 04:33.940
with some form
of the truth.

04:33.940 --> 04:38.011
What about those times the truth
is the one thing you can't say?

04:38.011 --> 04:41.014
Are you sure you want to keep
all of this from Landon?

04:41.014 --> 04:43.283
I mean, I understand you wanting
to protect him, but...

04:43.283 --> 04:46.086
He's been wondering about
his mother his whole life.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.088
He finally meets her
and then she dies.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.389
If I can keep him
from knowing

04:49.389 --> 04:51.324
what that feels like,
then it's worth it.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.963
(sighs) Look, it's my secret
to keep, Dr. Saltzman.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.400
Please.
Okay.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.302
Thank you.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.237
The trick is to give everyone
the right amount

05:04.237 --> 05:06.006
of information
without giving away too much.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.307
We've been through this
before with the knife,

05:07.307 --> 05:10.310
so it shouldn't come
as too much of a shock.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.814
This is our chance
to do things differently,

05:13.814 --> 05:16.850
more responsibly.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.385
Yesterday, I came
into possession

05:18.385 --> 05:21.354
of another Malivore artifact.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.323
It was my hope to find
a method of containment

05:23.323 --> 05:25.625
before it signaled
another monster,

05:25.625 --> 05:27.527
but given the
emergency meeting

05:27.527 --> 05:30.063
I've just called, I'm sure you
can guess how well that went.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.098
(students murmuring)
Do you see Hope anywhere?

05:32.098 --> 05:34.868
ALARIC: But rest assured we
are taking every precaution.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.336
Sheriff Donovan
has been kind enough

05:36.336 --> 05:39.039
to open the doors of the
Lockwood Mansion to us,

05:39.039 --> 05:41.241
so Mr. Williams and Ms. Tig
are now in the process

05:41.241 --> 05:44.110
of evacuating our students
from the lower grades.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.745
Why don't we just evacuate
the damn artifact?

05:45.745 --> 05:47.581
We are much more well-equipped

05:47.581 --> 05:50.717
than the world at large to
handle the arrival of a monster.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.619
Once we know what
we're dealing with

05:52.619 --> 05:54.087
and the problem
is contained,

05:54.087 --> 05:56.256
then we can reassess what
to do with the artifact.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.158
If any of you would
like to evacuate,

05:58.158 --> 06:00.927
please talk to Dorian or Emma.
However,

06:00.927 --> 06:03.096
exam week will continue
as scheduled,

06:03.096 --> 06:06.600
wherever you are.
I know. I'm sorry.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.002
I can't exactly call
the state accreditation board

06:09.002 --> 06:10.770
and tell them that we're
cancelling the exams

06:10.770 --> 06:12.806
because of monsters.

06:12.806 --> 06:16.676
We'll get through this,
I promise.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.078
Try and get
some rest, okay?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.846
Good night.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.085
You evacuating?
Hell no, man.

06:25.085 --> 06:29.689
I got four exams in the morning.
Need my beauty rest.

06:29.689 --> 06:33.026
(yawns)
Hope's M.I.A.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.795
Yeah, she's probably suiting
up in her battle armor.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.230
Girl's basically
Wonder Woman. (laughs)

06:37.230 --> 06:39.566
Either that or she's realized
she's made a mistake

06:39.566 --> 06:42.269
bringing me back here 'cause
where I go, danger follows.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.169
(sighs):
My God.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.672
Come on, bro.
Now, this one's not on you.

06:45.672 --> 06:48.842
I mean, her being distant today
has got to have something to do

06:48.842 --> 06:51.711
with us waking up in a field
with amnesia yesterday, right?

06:51.711 --> 06:53.313
Look, until one of you

06:53.313 --> 06:55.882
can remembers how you guys
got there, I just...

06:55.882 --> 06:57.284
I-I just wouldn't
think about it.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.352
Look, you're here. Think about
the good things in your life

06:59.352 --> 07:02.589
instead of getting caught up
in the bad for once, bro.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.058
Yeah.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.693
Uh, I'm gonna
grab my bags

07:06.693 --> 07:08.595
and hit the library.
Okay.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.799
I'll see you at breakfast
in the morning?

07:12.799 --> 07:14.267
Yeah, see you at breakfast.

07:16.169 --> 07:20.874
Hey, Lan, I'm glad
you're back.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.202
(roars)

08:40.787 --> 08:43.189
Raf.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.424
Hey.

08:44.424 --> 08:47.360
(groans)

08:47.360 --> 08:49.462
I passed out, huh?

08:49.462 --> 08:54.634
(chuckles)
You're very cute
when you sleep.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.536
What?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.804
What?

08:57.804 --> 09:00.840
Um, sorry, but I thought
you said, um...

09:02.609 --> 09:05.545
You know what, forget it.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.514
My brain's fried.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.749
Then maybe you should
take a break.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.225
Where is it?!
Kurt?

09:19.225 --> 09:21.561
What are you doing here?
You pathetic little punk.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.296
Where the hell is it?
Where's what?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.964
You know what I want!

09:24.964 --> 09:27.901
(crying): I don't know
what you want. I don't know.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.205
You know...

09:33.239 --> 09:35.308
...what I want.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.913
(shrieking)

09:39.913 --> 09:41.481
I don't know what you want!

09:41.481 --> 09:44.384
(panting)

10:07.440 --> 10:09.442
ALARIC: This happened
to you in a nightmare?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.244
Are you sure?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.213
Look, I know that
it sounds crazy,

10:13.213 --> 10:15.248
but I was studying
and then I fell asleep,

10:15.248 --> 10:16.316
and then I just started
dreaming about...

10:16.316 --> 10:18.318
About what?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.386
Um...

10:20.386 --> 10:21.721
Um...

10:21.721 --> 10:23.356
One of my old, uh, foster dads.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.925
He was in the library,
and he had this old belt

10:25.925 --> 10:28.161
that he used to use on me.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.797
Do you remember anything else?

10:30.797 --> 10:34.300
Yeah, there was, there was
this woman there, too.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.668
She was wearing an-an old,

10:35.668 --> 10:37.704
black dress and-and a veil.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.073
And she told me,
"You know what I want." But...

10:41.207 --> 10:43.176
The urn.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.744
Sounds like
our next monster showed up.

10:46.346 --> 10:50.316
You know, every culture on Earth
has legends about creatures

10:50.316 --> 10:53.086
that only appear in dreams.

10:55.088 --> 10:58.591
But a woman in a black dress
and a veil is pretty specific.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.529
So, does that mean
that she can, like,

11:02.529 --> 11:04.330
control what we see
in our dreams?

11:05.698 --> 11:08.167
That she can put stuff in
our, in our heads, right?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.536
It's possible.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.777
Does that look familiar?

11:21.848 --> 11:26.252
Our latest monster
is a Night Hag,

11:26.252 --> 11:29.188
a malevolent spirit
trapped on the astral plane

11:29.188 --> 11:31.658
that can only interact with us
through dreams.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.561
In this case, nightmares.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.729
So, like Freddy Krueger?

11:36.729 --> 11:38.865
Well, in the sense that what
happens to you in your dreams

11:38.865 --> 11:41.568
seems to also happen to you
in real life, yes.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.804
But the good news is we're safe,
so long as we stay awake.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.606
(students murmuring)
BOY: Stay awake?

11:46.606 --> 11:48.441
I've lined up
more evacuation shuttles.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.842
They should be running
all afternoon,

11:49.842 --> 11:53.379
so please, for those who don't
want to stay and fight,

11:53.379 --> 11:54.480
take advantage of them.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.582
All right, that's all.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.585
(students murmuring)

11:58.585 --> 12:00.820
LANDON:
What about you?

12:00.820 --> 12:02.221
You had any bad
dreams last night?

12:02.221 --> 12:05.625
No. I-I barely slept.
Just a lot on my mind.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.760
Yeah, same.
Just got the first-day jitters.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.395
(chuckles)

12:09.395 --> 12:11.397
So, has anything, um,
come back to you yet

12:11.397 --> 12:12.832
about our little
amnesia trip?

12:12.832 --> 12:15.401
I mean, this can't all be
a coincidence, right?

12:15.401 --> 12:19.272
Uh, you know, let's focus on
one problem at a time, okay?

12:19.272 --> 12:20.873
Okay, but, I mean,

12:20.873 --> 12:23.276
can I at least help you
solve this problem?

12:23.276 --> 12:24.877
I can be
a research assistant,

12:24.877 --> 12:26.746
I'm CPR certified,
and I know a little tai chi.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.781
Landon, I know
this isn't

12:28.781 --> 12:30.617
what you want to hear,
but the best way

12:30.617 --> 12:32.218
that you can help
is by evacuating.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.486
Well, are you leaving?

12:33.486 --> 12:34.887
No. I need to stay here.

12:34.887 --> 12:38.491
Okay, then thanks, but I should
probably get to class.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.794
(sighs)

13:35.348 --> 13:37.283
(ragged breathing)

13:41.688 --> 13:43.156
Yo, what-what is this?

13:43.156 --> 13:46.392
You can't say these things
about Big D, my man. Okay?

13:46.392 --> 13:47.660
Like, the guy,
you can't, you...

13:47.660 --> 13:50.096
Is that my presentation?

13:50.096 --> 13:52.198
Yo, just because
you need to dry out

13:52.198 --> 13:55.401
does not mean you need to take
down the entire vampire canon.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.572
Just because vampires have been
like this for the last century

13:59.572 --> 14:01.841
doesn't mean
we have to stay that way.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.243
What are you...?

14:04.243 --> 14:06.145
MG, what...?

14:06.145 --> 14:09.148
Dracula, as a novel,
has only retained relevance

14:09.148 --> 14:12.552
in modern times because of our
patriarchal culture's obsession

14:12.552 --> 14:15.188
with the idea of
a privileged, powerful man

14:15.188 --> 14:18.791
who does absolutely what
he wants with absolute impunity.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.427
Meaning we've spent weeks
in this class

14:21.427 --> 14:24.731
analyzing the literary value
of a character who basically

14:24.731 --> 14:27.033
abuses consent in every way...
(voice fades)

14:40.246 --> 14:41.347
What is it, Mr. Kirby?

14:41.347 --> 14:42.849
I think there's some
kind of mistake.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.684
I'm not-- I don't think I'm
supposed to be taking any tests.

14:44.684 --> 14:45.852
It's my first day.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.653
Of course you're
supposed to take an exam.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.622
If you don't pass,
you're not allowed to stay.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.424
But I haven't even started.
I didn't know.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.226
I suggest
you produce answers

14:53.226 --> 14:54.761
and not excuses.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.196
Five minutes left,
everyone.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.438
(sighs)

15:08.407 --> 15:10.843
I'm sorry.
I need another pencil.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.079
On the desk near the window.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.685
(laughter)

15:28.494 --> 15:31.264
(laughter echoing)

15:33.599 --> 15:36.769
This is a nightmare.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.538
How do I wake up?

15:38.538 --> 15:41.774
NIGHT HAG (echoing): You know
what you must do, Landon.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.744
Bring it home.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.683
(gasps loudly)
MG: ...because that is
what we deserve as...

15:50.683 --> 15:53.152
as the student body.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.666
ALARIC (over P.A.): The senior
witch faculty has mixed together

16:06.666 --> 16:09.101
a batch of energy herbs
to help you stay awake.

16:09.101 --> 16:11.537
So, for those of you who are not
getting on the evacuation bus,

16:11.537 --> 16:13.539
for lack of a
better term,

16:13.539 --> 16:17.343
please dose yourselves
responsibly.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.478
I'm gonna get sued.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.314
Or hexed, at
the very least.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.715
You don't have to be
so hard on yourself.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.983
At my last school,
the gym teacher was

16:23.983 --> 16:25.651
dealing coke
under the bleachers.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.385
Oh, yeah, that only

16:26.385 --> 16:27.954
makes me feel marginally better.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.455
Ow.
HOPE:
Hey, uh, hold still.

16:29.455 --> 16:30.556
I'm almost done, okay?

16:30.556 --> 16:32.158
Okay. What do you
think she meant

16:32.158 --> 16:33.459
when she said "bring it home"?

16:33.459 --> 16:35.127
I'm guessing she
means Malivore.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.596
It seems her plan is

16:36.596 --> 16:39.065
to torment us
until we produce the urn.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.801
Right.
But if the Night Hag

16:41.801 --> 16:43.836
is a monster that's trapped
on the astral plane,

16:43.836 --> 16:46.639
then how can she even physically
take the urn anywhere?

16:46.639 --> 16:47.940
Yeah, the book also says

16:47.940 --> 16:51.110
the Night Hag can't affect
our reality, but...

16:51.110 --> 16:54.080
Rafael's welt and your hand
seemed to prove that wrong.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.483
When your research consists of
fairy tales and urban legends,

16:57.483 --> 17:00.152
sometimes the stories
get twisted.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.621
Human dragon, anyone?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.456
Dorian might be busy
with the evacuation,

17:03.456 --> 17:04.957
but we'll figure
this out.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.492
When the Night Hag finds
a way to get the urn,

17:06.492 --> 17:08.027
we'll be there
to stop it.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.364
Well, at least it was
a pretty memorable first day.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.934
Yeah, and the Night Hag is
likely just getting started.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.403
You know, Landon, I really wish

17:17.403 --> 17:19.205
you'd just evacuate
with the others.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.108
I worked so hard to get here.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.977
If I run at the first sign
of trouble, what's the point?

17:24.977 --> 17:29.482
The point, Landon, is that
we're trying to look after you.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.251
Honestly, you two are
taking better care of me

17:32.251 --> 17:33.986
than anyone in my life ever has.

17:33.986 --> 17:38.424
Course, I had to stab myself
to get your attention.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.530
You know, we're all good here.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.240
I'm blowing this, aren't I?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.208
You know, Landon,

17:56.208 --> 18:01.580
sometimes the best thing for
Hope is to just let her be Hope.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.416
Stay busy.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.117
She'll talk when she's ready.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.292
(grunting loudly)

18:17.163 --> 18:18.965
Hey.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.233
Have something
against the bag?

18:21.233 --> 18:23.302
Yeah, I'm almost done here.
(chuckles)

18:23.302 --> 18:24.437
I'll get out your way.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.106
You know, no, actually,
I could use a sparring partner.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.643
If I don't punch someone,
I'm gonna fall asleep.

18:30.643 --> 18:34.380

19:25.698 --> 19:28.334
I'm really sorry about all the
things that happened to you

19:28.334 --> 19:30.603
in your life that made you
so good at brawling,

19:30.603 --> 19:33.406
but I really needed that
just now.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.374
(chuckles)

19:37.343 --> 19:39.278
(sighs)

19:41.814 --> 19:43.949
Listen...

19:47.820 --> 19:50.923
I don't mean to get
in your business, but...

19:50.923 --> 19:52.925
be cool with Landon, okay?

19:52.925 --> 19:55.361
I know him, and he's
not gonna believe

19:55.361 --> 19:58.164
that he's welcome here until
he's about to graduate.

19:58.164 --> 20:00.232
He's gonna be waiting
on the other shoe to drop.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.368
And look, if-if you're
gonna drop that shoe,

20:02.368 --> 20:05.371
all I ask is that you...
you be gentle, okay?

20:05.371 --> 20:08.374
What makes you think
that there's another shoe?

20:08.374 --> 20:10.309
Where we're from, there's
always another shoe.

20:10.309 --> 20:14.413
Sometimes it's-it's
an actual shoe or...

20:14.413 --> 20:17.416
a belt.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.717
But you get the point.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.586
Look, if you're
cooling off on him,

20:20.586 --> 20:22.588
fine.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.923
But just don't lie to him.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.592
I'm not cooling off on him.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.294
Why have you been avoiding him?

20:28.294 --> 20:29.729
Because there's a lot going on.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.198
It couldn't hurt to be
a little more honest about it.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.333
I'm being as honest as I can be.
Yeah.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.802
And somewhere still in that
is a lie.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.205
You've never lied
to protect someone?

20:39.205 --> 20:42.875
No, Hope. I haven't.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.248
LANDON:
Dr. Saltzman.

21:22.248 --> 21:25.351
"Dr. Saltzman, I have
changed my mind.

21:25.351 --> 21:26.952
"I've decided
to take you up on your offer

21:26.952 --> 21:29.655
and get the hell out with every
other sane person here."

21:29.655 --> 21:33.025
No, actually, I took your advice
and I stayed busy,

21:33.025 --> 21:34.660
and I think I found something.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.929
(sighs)

21:41.534 --> 21:44.303
Let's pretend for a second
that the research isn't wrong.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.539
Maybe the Night Hag can't
hurt us in real life.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.607
Maybe the Night Hag
can't leave the astral plane

21:48.607 --> 21:51.410
and get ahold of the urn,
so maybe we are not dealing

21:51.410 --> 21:53.345
with a Night Hag.
ALARIC: Well,
if it walks like a Night Hag,

21:53.345 --> 21:55.681
and talks like a Night Hag,
what else could it be?

21:55.681 --> 21:57.316
That's exactly what I was
wondering, so then I started

21:57.316 --> 21:59.585
going through
all these books, and boom.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.955
What's an Oneiroi?

22:02.955 --> 22:04.857
It's a black-winged
shapeshifting dream demon

22:04.857 --> 22:06.492
from Greek mythology.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.661
Yeah, of course he knows
what it is. (chuckles)

22:08.661 --> 22:11.530
Why would one monster disguise
itself as another monster?

22:11.530 --> 22:13.165
The Oneiroi sounds
freaky enough.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.934
Because if we knew
what it actually was...

22:14.934 --> 22:17.269
We'd know how to stop it.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.171
Hope, kiss him for me.

22:23.409 --> 22:24.944
A black-winged what?

22:24.944 --> 22:26.312
BOTH:
Shapeshifting dream demon.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.047
I know it sounds bad,

22:28.047 --> 22:29.982
but now that we know what the
creature is, we can fight it.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.618
How the hell are we supposed
to kill a dream demon?

22:32.618 --> 22:35.020
Leave that part to me.
But since I can't fall asleep

22:35.020 --> 22:37.289
without compromising
the location of the urn,

22:37.289 --> 22:40.059
I need someone else to pull it
out of the dream plane

22:40.059 --> 22:41.527
and into our waking reality.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.696
So, Freddy Krueger. Like I said.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.965
Wait, how the hell are
we supposed to do that?

22:45.965 --> 22:47.399
MG: If it's anything
like the movies,

22:47.399 --> 22:51.003
we just grab and pull.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.405
Yeah, okay. Is it too late to
get on the, uh, evacuation bus?

22:53.405 --> 22:56.308
No. I mean, I'm not gonna
ask all of you to stay

22:56.308 --> 22:58.143
for this,
it has to be your choice.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.982
I'm not leaving
unless Hope does.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.752
We already know
the answer to that, so...

23:06.752 --> 23:10.022
I'm not leaving Landon behind.

23:10.022 --> 23:13.158
MG: I'm a founding member
of the Super Squad,

23:13.158 --> 23:16.495
so I can't bail.

23:16.495 --> 23:18.430
Y'all gonna
get yourselves killed.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.868
(sighs)

23:22.868 --> 23:24.403
But if MG stays,

23:24.403 --> 23:25.604
I stay.

23:25.604 --> 23:27.473
No child left behind.

23:28.674 --> 23:31.543
In that case, it's naptime.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.820
(exhales)

23:46.892 --> 23:48.260
Hey, what are you doing?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.396
What any rational,
adult caretaker

23:50.396 --> 23:51.797
of children should be doing.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.332
We found out how to kill
the Night Hag,

23:53.332 --> 23:54.500
and now I'm taking the urn

23:54.500 --> 23:56.368
as far away as possible
to do just that.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.736
But we already have
a whole plan.

23:57.736 --> 23:59.505
Yeah. A plan that puts you
and your fellow students

23:59.505 --> 24:01.206
in the direct line of danger.
I didn't even tell you

24:01.206 --> 24:03.609
where I hid the urn.
Yeah, well,
you didn't have to.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.477
I found it, in the safe
with the Mikaelson crest

24:05.477 --> 24:08.213
that you built under the
floorboards of your closet.

24:08.213 --> 24:10.249
Like I said earlier,
it is my job

24:10.249 --> 24:11.684
to take care of all of you,

24:11.684 --> 24:13.319
and that's exactly
what I'm doing right now.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.622
No, you're doing
that thing that you do.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.524
Waving your adult card around,

24:18.524 --> 24:21.126
forgetting that it means
you're a father of two.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.361
You're fallible.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.129
You're human. You can be killed.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.899
I've also been kicking
supernatural ass

24:26.899 --> 24:28.834
longer than you've been alive.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.039
(rock music playing)

24:45.451 --> 24:46.985
(music stops)

24:49.788 --> 24:52.791
(phone beeps)
Hey, girls.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.260
I'm guessing you're with your
mother, taking your exams.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.396
Hers are much harder than mine,
so you're probably wishing

24:57.396 --> 25:00.966
you'd stayed behind to fight
the latest Malivore monster.

25:00.966 --> 25:04.937
About that:
I've done something very smart.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.939
Or very dumb.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.207
And if it doesn't work out,

25:08.207 --> 25:10.075
you're gonna be
really upset with me.

25:10.075 --> 25:13.946
Just know that I love you both
very much.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.398
What'd you do to him?

25:32.398 --> 25:34.133
Nothing.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.268
He's so tired, he must've
nodded off on his own.

25:38.437 --> 25:39.471
(rock music playing)

25:42.875 --> 25:44.376
(music stops)

25:49.848 --> 25:52.518
(tires screeching)

25:52.518 --> 25:54.286
Damn it.

25:55.421 --> 25:57.022
Hey, man,

25:57.022 --> 25:59.992
whatever you see in there,
it's not real, okay?

25:59.992 --> 26:02.428
Oh, I know. I've already faced
my worst nightmares

26:02.428 --> 26:05.898
in that cemetery,
so bring it on, Hag. (chuckles)

26:05.898 --> 26:07.299
HOPE:
Landon, I don't think

26:07.299 --> 26:08.834
you should do this.
No. Uh-uh. You don't get to

26:08.834 --> 26:10.869
ignore me all day, then
make decisions for me.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.438
You're gonna be inside
of a nightmare.

26:12.438 --> 26:13.539
Yeah.
This monster

26:13.539 --> 26:14.907
can get inside of your head,

26:14.907 --> 26:15.974
use your worst fears
against you.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.209
Are you kidding?

26:17.209 --> 26:18.911
My biggest fear was
fitting in here.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.579
(laughs):
Now I'm a dream warrior.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.915
Plus, I saved the day. Well, I--
no, I found the plan that saved

26:22.915 --> 26:25.017
the day. You're the one that's
actually gonna save the day.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.952
Which is so sexy, by the way.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.887
I'm staying,

26:28.887 --> 26:30.155
and I'm gonna help you
stop this thing.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.257
I don't know what it's gonna
take to stop it.

26:32.257 --> 26:36.562
But maybe there's one thing
that you can do to help me.

26:36.562 --> 26:38.497
(whispering):
I need you to hide the urn.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.537
Sweet dreams.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.073
(Alaric panting)

26:51.210 --> 26:54.513
This is all just a bad dream.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.483
(tires screeching)

27:01.954 --> 27:05.357
You know what I need.

27:05.357 --> 27:06.625

27:06.625 --> 27:08.293

27:28.680 --> 27:29.648
NARRATOR (over video):
Vampires are bad.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.517
Vampires are evil.

27:31.517 --> 27:34.520
Vampires are the scourge
of the Earth.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.255
Vampires are bad.
Vampires are evil.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.491
Vampires are the scourge
of the Earth.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.094
Vampires are bad...
(muffled screaming)

27:42.094 --> 27:43.495
Vampires are evil.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.405
(panting)

27:53.405 --> 27:56.975
(bones cracking)
(screaming)

28:18.530 --> 28:20.399
Raf. Hey. Hey.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.968
It's okay.
I'm here now.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.136
Get away, get away, get away.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.572
Hey, it's okay.
You can't hurt me.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.073
(exhales)

28:28.073 --> 28:30.442
It's okay.

28:34.079 --> 28:36.848
I'm not afraid
of hurting you.

28:36.848 --> 28:39.151
I want to be with you.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.621
Don't you want that, too?

28:52.698 --> 28:55.934
I guess I already lived
through my nightmare.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.972
So screw you
and your stupid test,

28:59.972 --> 29:02.474
because none of this is real!

29:02.474 --> 29:04.610
(low creaking)

29:08.480 --> 29:09.815
No, no, no!

29:14.052 --> 29:15.687
I-I didn't.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.956
I wasn't feeding.
I-I swore off that.

29:17.956 --> 29:20.359
NIGHT HAG (echoing):
It's who you are.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.395
Look around.

29:26.832 --> 29:29.568
(yelling, whimpering)

29:29.568 --> 29:33.772
NIGHT HAG: You defend your kind,
yet still fear you are wrong.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.742
You are nothing. Nothing!
(screams)

29:40.045 --> 29:41.780
(grunting)

29:41.780 --> 29:44.816
NIGHT HAG:
Small spaces, Landon.

29:44.816 --> 29:46.752
Getting smaller.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.356
This...

29:51.356 --> 29:54.459
is all...

29:54.459 --> 29:56.128
you.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.331
Fine. So be it.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.405
I would never do this to Landon.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.107
This isn't real.

30:09.107 --> 30:11.877
You're not real!

30:14.646 --> 30:16.248
But you wish it was,

30:16.248 --> 30:19.985
and that makes you
the worst kind of monster.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.019
(shrieking)

30:21.019 --> 30:22.521
(shouts)

30:22.521 --> 30:24.022
You know how to make

30:24.022 --> 30:26.491
your suffering stop.
You're damn straight I do.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.593
(cackles)

30:28.593 --> 30:30.729
You know what you need to do
to end this.

30:30.729 --> 30:33.031
Bring me the urn.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.666
You can drop the act.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.268
Show me your face.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.105
(shrieking)

30:40.105 --> 30:41.606
Your real face.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.483
(bellows)

30:52.417 --> 30:56.021
You know where it is.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.589
Yeah. I know where it is.

31:00.726 --> 31:03.195
You want the urn so bad?

31:03.195 --> 31:05.330
Let's go get it.
(shouts)

31:05.330 --> 31:07.566

31:07.566 --> 31:08.667

31:08.667 --> 31:11.570
Hope.
MG:
Are we alive, dude?

31:11.570 --> 31:13.371
Did we win?
Hey, is everybody okay?

Thanks.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.752
Are you okay?

33:42.921 --> 33:44.489
You know, all day it feels like
I've been waiting

33:44.489 --> 33:46.424
for the other shoe
to drop with you.

33:48.760 --> 33:54.466
You know, uh, when Landon and I
first met at Hector and Maria's?

33:54.466 --> 33:57.469
He told me the story about
this guy four towns over

33:57.469 --> 33:59.905
who used to burn him
with cigarettes for sport.

33:59.905 --> 34:02.874
Yeah, I heard about that.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.578
I felt this crazy need
to protect him.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.980
Even though I knew
it wouldn't change anything.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.783
So, one day I took
a couple buses,

34:11.783 --> 34:13.752
I knocked on that guy's door

34:13.752 --> 34:15.487
and I beat the crap out of him.

34:17.856 --> 34:20.325
I never told Landon
about it, either.

34:20.325 --> 34:22.494
I knew that he wouldn't want
to be a part

34:22.494 --> 34:23.495
of something like that.

34:26.331 --> 34:29.634
So, what I said earlier
about lying, I...

34:29.634 --> 34:30.936
I was being a hypocrite.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.638
Because when someone
is as important

34:33.638 --> 34:35.340
as Landon is to me,

34:35.340 --> 34:37.842
I'll do what's best for him.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.445
Even if that means
having to lie.

34:43.848 --> 34:45.083
But I'll also have to
protect him

34:45.083 --> 34:47.919
from being hurt
in other ways, too.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.059
So, you and I, we can't
talk like this anymore.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.607
(laughing) Yo.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.109
That's one more monster down.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.212
You two are now officially
part of the Super Squad.

35:14.212 --> 35:15.380
Dope.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.215
(laughs)
You made it.

35:17.215 --> 35:19.451
Are you ready?
What?

35:19.451 --> 35:21.353
(beatboxing)

35:21.353 --> 35:24.289
Oh, here we go. Yeah.
He said it. Super Squad.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.357
No one realer.

35:25.357 --> 35:28.460
Never dreamed I'd be the one
to be a dream killer.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.229
It's like Salvatore's School
meets "Thriller."

35:31.229 --> 35:34.032
It tried to creep up on me,
but it was sleeping on me.

35:34.032 --> 35:37.168
Couldn't touch it,
couldn't put my hand on.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.971

I can land on.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.673

always take a chance on.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.742
She killed a demon,

35:43.742 --> 35:45.477
and I just killed the damn song.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.012
(laughs)
What?

35:47.012 --> 35:48.179
No, that's crazy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:48.179 --> 35:49.614
Yo, that's nuts.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.416

like you were avoiding me,

36:57.082 --> 36:59.517
keeping things from me.

39:35.139 --> 39:37.542
How can we help you?
I have a few questions

39:37.542 --> 39:40.578
for one of your older
foster children, if he's around.

39:40.578 --> 39:42.080
No, sorry.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.215
Rafael was lucky to be adopted

39:44.215 --> 39:46.217
by a wonderful family
in Virginia.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.721
Actually, I'm here to speak
with Landon Kirby.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.357
Uh, we've discovered
some troubling

39:52.357 --> 39:54.125
information about
his birth parents.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.127
Landon was also lucky
to be adopted

39:56.127 --> 39:58.396
by a wonderful family
in Virginia.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.633
I see.

40:01.633 --> 40:05.637
Our records indicate that you're
still receiving subsidy checks

40:05.637 --> 40:07.438
for both those boys.

40:07.438 --> 40:10.675
If they're no longer
in your care, that's a felony.

40:10.675 --> 40:14.479
Well, two felonies, each.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.381
But I might be able

40:16.381 --> 40:19.250
to hold off on reporting
that accounting error

40:19.250 --> 40:20.718
if there's more
you could tell me

40:20.718 --> 40:22.120
about Landon Kirby's
whereabouts.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.588
HECTOR:
No, sorry.

40:23.588 --> 40:27.659
He was lucky to be adopted
by a wonderful family in...

40:27.659 --> 40:29.160
Virginia.

40:30.194 --> 40:31.796
I see.

40:31.796 --> 40:34.799
You've said
all you're able to say,

40:34.799 --> 40:37.001
literally.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.371
In that case,
would you happen to have

40:40.371 --> 40:42.140
any of this young man's
belongings?

40:42.140 --> 40:45.543
A journal, a letter,

40:45.543 --> 40:47.278
or a photograph?

40:47.278 --> 40:49.180
Why don't you come inside?

40:50.148 --> 40:53.418
(laughs softly)
Delighted.
