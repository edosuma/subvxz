00:59.484 --> 01:00.817
Hail, Hitler!

01:00.819 --> 01:02.886
Hail, Hitler!

01:06.658 --> 01:08.691
I got it.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.660
- I got it!
- Got what?

01:10.662 --> 01:12.762
Okay, when the Mothership
returned to the present,

01:12.764 --> 01:15.932
we tracked it down to this
50-mile area of Oakland, right?

01:15.934 --> 01:17.433
- None of this is news.
- Hold on.

01:17.435 --> 01:20.036
Well, I accessed the city
power grid's computers,

01:20.038 --> 01:23.540
and this electrical substation
here has massive power drains.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.643
We're talking enough power to
either stage Lollapalooza...

01:26.645 --> 01:28.311
Or recharge the Mothership.

01:28.313 --> 01:29.712
You're saying you've
narrowed its location

01:29.714 --> 01:32.048
- to this neighborhood?
- No.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.884
I'm saying I've narrowed
it to this block.

01:42.814 --> 01:44.948
Hey, how about some Black Sabbath?

01:46.584 --> 01:49.619
The music relaxes me.

01:49.621 --> 01:52.322
You want me relaxed.

01:59.430 --> 02:01.330
We got company.

02:03.334 --> 02:05.268
We gotta go. Power it up!

02:05.270 --> 02:07.003
How much longer?

02:07.005 --> 02:08.437
30 seconds.

02:08.439 --> 02:10.406
Anthony?

02:10.407 --> 02:13.676
If you wanna take this thing
on board without exploding,

02:13.678 --> 02:16.913
- it's 30 seconds.
- Move, move, go, go, go!

02:16.915 --> 02:17.880
Grab what you can.

02:23.188 --> 02:24.921
Go.

02:50.998 --> 02:52.832
Fire!

03:01.641 --> 03:04.676
Techs are combing
through everything now.

03:04.678 --> 03:06.678
Flynn left a lot behind, but
there's no sign of the nuke.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.979
Do we have a lock on where he went?

03:07.981 --> 03:11.249
December 9, 1944. Germany.

03:11.251 --> 03:14.485
The U.S. didn't have a
working A-bomb until 1945.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.021
If Flynn gives one to the
Nazis before the war is over...

03:17.023 --> 03:18.957
The war is over.

03:18.959 --> 03:21.326
We need to get you back
to Mason Industries.

03:21.328 --> 03:23.728
Flynn is somewhere inside
this 50 square mile area

03:23.730 --> 03:25.697
in northwest Germany, 1944.

03:25.699 --> 03:27.165
What's so special about there?

03:27.167 --> 03:28.933
That's the thing. Not much.

03:28.935 --> 03:30.802
Lots of forest,
farmland, a local castle.

03:30.804 --> 03:32.503
What about the date? Any significance?

03:32.505 --> 03:34.105
There is one thing.

03:34.107 --> 03:36.441
There was a tavern called
Das Stein Haus, here.

03:36.443 --> 03:39.243
It may have been a rendezvous
place for the Allied Resistance.

03:39.425 --> 03:41.793
It's not 100%. The accounts are spotty,

03:41.795 --> 03:44.362
but maybe someone there can
point us in the right direction.

03:44.364 --> 03:45.596
Just so I'm clear,

03:45.598 --> 03:47.398
you want to drop us into Nazi territory,

03:47.400 --> 03:49.200
roll up blind to some bar,

03:49.202 --> 03:50.868
and just convince someone there
that we don't know to help us?

03:50.870 --> 03:53.805
By the way, bring him?

03:53.807 --> 03:55.973
Well, it's either that or give
the Nazis a nuclear weapon.

03:55.975 --> 03:57.842
Well, does anyone
here even speak German?

03:57.844 --> 03:59.644
I do.

03:59.646 --> 04:01.279
Really? You do?

04:01.761 --> 04:04.061
Yeah, four languages, actually.

04:04.063 --> 04:05.229
- Oh.
- The Army drops us

04:05.231 --> 04:06.864
into other places than Palo Alto.

04:06.866 --> 04:08.966
Well, does anyone have any idea

04:08.968 --> 04:10.668
how we're gonna get lederhosen
in the next five minutes?

04:10.670 --> 04:12.636
Ah, about that.

04:15.808 --> 04:17.675
Wardrobe dock.

04:17.957 --> 04:21.190
Hundreds of expertly-crafted
outfits suitable for any era.

04:21.192 --> 04:23.860
Uh, sorted by geographic
area then by year.

04:23.862 --> 04:26.296
Germany's this way.

04:26.298 --> 04:27.831
Isn't this all a bit much?

04:27.833 --> 04:29.499
Well, it's better to have and not need,

04:29.501 --> 04:32.069
than need and not have.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.104
And it doesn't seem like
these missions are ending

04:34.106 --> 04:37.307
any time soon, so...

04:56.094 --> 04:58.094
Hey.

04:59.364 --> 05:00.997
You okay?

05:08.407 --> 05:10.073
Really? You do?

05:10.075 --> 05:12.375
Yeah, four languages, actually.

05:12.377 --> 05:13.944
- Oh.
- The Army drops us

05:13.946 --> 05:16.146
into other places than Palo Alto.

05:16.987 --> 05:18.347
So when we get to this tavern,

05:18.369 --> 05:19.616
how do we let 'em know we're friendly?

05:19.841 --> 05:22.669
Uh, well, the accounts that I've read

05:22.674 --> 05:25.971
said that you have to order
a specific Cognac at the bar.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.758
A '23 Remy Martin.

05:27.769 --> 05:29.562
These the spotty, unreliable accounts?

05:29.855 --> 05:31.183
Unfortunately, yes.

05:39.942 --> 05:41.297
All right.

05:41.745 --> 05:42.754
Hang on.

06:15.450 --> 06:17.597
We really need to start
bringing some Dramamine.

06:25.681 --> 06:27.150
Oh, my God.

06:38.867 --> 06:41.235
No way he's out here alone.

06:58.759 --> 06:59.832
So,

07:00.031 --> 07:01.558
how do we...

07:11.706 --> 07:12.769
You couldn't have,

07:13.067 --> 07:14.478
I don't know, tied him up or something?

07:14.512 --> 07:16.343
Yeah, I could of, but
he might have escaped.

07:16.381 --> 07:18.364
Look, I get that you
didn't have a choice

07:18.390 --> 07:20.393
with the first guy, but if
you don't have to kill someone,

07:20.432 --> 07:22.335
you shouldn't. We should at least try

07:22.355 --> 07:23.836
- and protect history.
- Protect Nazis?

07:23.878 --> 07:26.241
No, I'm just saying there
is a bigger picture here.

07:26.259 --> 07:27.458
Hey, hey!

07:27.480 --> 07:28.742
You guys hear that?

07:31.513 --> 07:33.461
Move. Now!

07:56.911 --> 07:59.462
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:07.042 --> 08:09.085
All right, Lucy and I head in,

08:09.087 --> 08:11.180
order the drink,
hopefully get some help.

08:11.673 --> 08:13.423
Or at least not die.

08:13.642 --> 08:15.058
- Rufus...
- Stays right here.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.127
No, I'm gonna need you
to get one of those cars.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.341
Rufus stays right here.

08:19.364 --> 08:21.311
We don't know who or what is in there,

08:21.349 --> 08:24.034
and if things go south, we need
a car with the engine running.

08:24.232 --> 08:26.727
- I can hot-wire one.
- All right, just, uh...

08:27.153 --> 08:28.738
make it fast.

10:45.584 --> 10:46.696
Ah.

10:56.977 --> 10:58.253
Sir...

11:24.460 --> 11:26.440
Put it away. Now.

11:26.496 --> 11:27.845
Before you get us all shot.

11:27.965 --> 11:29.516
Perhaps you can tell by my accent,

11:29.533 --> 11:31.442
but I'm not German, you idiot.

11:31.967 --> 11:34.153
Uh... What?

11:34.468 --> 11:36.200
- You're...
- Allied Resistance.

11:36.482 --> 11:38.020
I was in the middle of gathering intel

11:38.031 --> 11:39.570
until you two waltzed in.

11:39.619 --> 11:41.072
I swear, you Americans.

11:41.103 --> 11:42.956
You couldn't stand
out more if you tried.

11:42.973 --> 11:44.583
Don't move.

11:46.337 --> 11:47.803
- I stand corrected.
- Rufus!

11:47.830 --> 11:49.844
Rufus, it's... it's okay. He's...

11:49.894 --> 11:51.166
he's okay.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.642
We work with the OSS. I'm Agent...

11:54.872 --> 11:56.763
I'm Wyatt Logan. This is Lucy Preston.

11:56.763 --> 11:58.252
That's our pilot, Rufus.

11:58.372 --> 12:01.434
Well, relief to see a lovely
face in... an ugly place.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.934
Now, what are you lot doing here

12:03.951 --> 12:06.269
- besides cocking up my operation?
- If it's all the same,

12:06.302 --> 12:07.829
I would love to take this conversation

12:07.851 --> 12:10.080
someplace a little bit more Nazi free.

12:10.916 --> 12:12.454
I got a car.

12:12.456 --> 12:14.063
- Huh.
- Wai...

12:14.183 --> 12:16.391
um, what's your name?

12:16.675 --> 12:18.689
Fleming. Ian Fleming.

12:19.254 --> 12:20.495
6.

12:20.797 --> 12:22.351
Wait a minute, you're...

12:22.838 --> 12:24.033
Ian Fleming?

12:25.764 --> 12:27.230
Have we met?

12:27.232 --> 12:28.597
No.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.728
It's... I... no.

12:30.848 --> 12:31.962
Right.

12:32.404 --> 12:33.882
Shall we?

12:35.373 --> 12:36.720
- That's...
- I know.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.497
- That's Ian Fleming.
- The Ian Fleming, the dude

12:43.498 --> 12:44.781
- that wrote "James Bond."
- Yes.

12:44.901 --> 12:48.041
He was an actual spy in
World War II, a good one.

12:48.523 --> 12:49.884
You a Bond fan?

12:50.299 --> 12:51.621
Yeah, little bit.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.178
Me too. Love his movies.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.251
And the books.

12:55.450 --> 12:56.712
So...

12:56.832 --> 12:59.789
you lot are chasing an atomic weapon?

13:00.558 --> 13:03.280
- Those are only theoretical.
- No, they're real.

13:03.471 --> 13:05.148
This high-level threat we're tracking,

13:05.640 --> 13:07.056
he stole a functional prototype.

13:07.176 --> 13:08.751
We think he's going to
give it to the Nazis.

13:08.795 --> 13:10.229
We saw a convoy on the way over here.

13:10.251 --> 13:11.995
There was a flatbed truck
with a V2 rocket on it.

13:11.996 --> 13:13.944
And you think the Krauts
are going to try and arm it

13:13.964 --> 13:15.781
with this atom bomb?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.353
That's the theory.

13:18.561 --> 13:21.136
At least my intel is finally
starting to make sense.

13:21.138 --> 13:22.571
Here, take a look at this.

13:22.573 --> 13:23.696
Here.

13:24.008 --> 13:26.141
This is Castle Varlar, here.

13:26.144 --> 13:28.871
Next to it, the Nazis have
been building a launch pad.

13:28.991 --> 13:31.801
They're holding a demonstration
of that V2 rocket tonight.

13:31.805 --> 13:33.081
What kind of demonstration?

13:33.244 --> 13:35.688
Members of the High Command
are going to sip champagne

13:35.723 --> 13:38.320
as they watch the rocket
be launched into Belgium.

13:38.928 --> 13:41.623
The target is civilians
and Allied troops.

13:42.526 --> 13:44.638
How powerful is this atomic weapon?

13:45.878 --> 13:48.914
It'll completely obliterate
everything in a 3-mile radius.

13:50.795 --> 13:52.725
That'd be worst than
Britain during the Blitz.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.632
If you can get us to that launch pad,

13:54.634 --> 13:56.359
we can disarm that rocket.

13:56.616 --> 13:59.392
- Right?
- I mean, probably. Yeah.

13:59.954 --> 14:00.977
I guess so.

14:02.676 --> 14:03.840
All right.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.367
Well...

14:05.443 --> 14:07.692
First things first.

14:09.024 --> 14:10.937
- So we're drinking now?
- Well,

14:11.233 --> 14:12.899
with what you've been through,

14:13.066 --> 14:14.920
and what we're about to go through,

14:15.686 --> 14:17.633
- absolutely.
- Amen to that.

14:18.585 --> 14:19.791
Cheers, chaps.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.332
It's, uh,

14:26.934 --> 14:28.915
bad form to leave a poured glass full.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.345
Dude.

14:40.743 --> 14:42.762
James Bond just hit on Lucy.

14:51.403 --> 14:52.558
What?

14:53.802 --> 14:56.180
The purpose of a spy is to blend in.

14:57.255 --> 14:58.229
I'm the pilot.

14:58.902 --> 15:00.198
From Tuskegee.

15:01.010 --> 15:02.643
I'm the one that got us here.

15:05.693 --> 15:06.799
Can I, um...

15:07.609 --> 15:08.804
can I ask you something?

15:09.048 --> 15:10.354
About spying?

15:10.474 --> 15:11.407
Of course.

15:11.527 --> 15:12.910
How do you get used to it?

15:13.030 --> 15:13.890
Keeping secrets,

15:13.907 --> 15:15.793
lying to everyone all the time?

15:15.913 --> 15:18.838
- Even to people close to you.
- I don't consider what I do lying.

15:19.609 --> 15:20.614
What would you call it?

15:20.818 --> 15:22.269
Playing a role to get what I need.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.683
Yeah, but people that trust
you would see it different.

15:26.046 --> 15:28.915
Rufus, there are allies,
contacts, and women,

15:29.331 --> 15:30.644
but never trust.

15:30.938 --> 15:32.332
Only the mission.

16:26.031 --> 16:27.359
The bomb's not here.

16:27.572 --> 16:29.050
What do you mean? It has to be.

16:29.068 --> 16:30.683
I'm not picking up any
traces of radiation.

16:30.701 --> 16:32.038
It's nowhere near here.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.436
Well, perhaps we're early.

16:33.463 --> 16:34.981
Maybe the Nazis haven't attached it yet.

16:35.021 --> 16:36.942
Look, you can't just strap
it on with some duct tape.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.748
There is no way they
armed one of these rockets

16:38.764 --> 16:39.965
in time for the launch tonight.

16:39.970 --> 16:41.816
Maybe we're wrong
about why Flynn's here.

16:44.639 --> 16:45.741
We gotta move.

16:45.861 --> 16:46.945
We gotta move.

17:45.293 --> 17:47.581
Stop, stop. Don't shoot.

17:47.701 --> 17:48.944
You can't shoot.

17:49.552 --> 17:51.389
That's Wernher Von Braun
standing next to Flynn.

17:51.439 --> 17:52.700
Who the hell is that?

17:52.740 --> 17:55.141
Someone we can't risk getting
caught in the crossfire.

17:55.346 --> 17:57.790
- Flynn is right there!
- Please, Wyatt.

17:57.958 --> 18:00.172
You can't. You have to trust me.

18:01.008 --> 18:03.248
Explain again why I can't kill Flynn.

18:04.066 --> 18:06.638
We can't risk Von
Braun. We need him alive.

18:06.655 --> 18:08.076
He's the father of their rocket program.

18:08.092 --> 18:09.555
- He's a genius.
- Right, got it.

18:09.573 --> 18:11.075
Wouldn't wanna kill a smart Nazi.

18:11.077 --> 18:13.114
Any operative that spots
Von Braun has orders

18:13.114 --> 18:14.752
to apprehend him immediately.

18:14.951 --> 18:17.716
The Allies want him for
themselves. You know that.

18:18.262 --> 18:21.548
This man's rockets rained
on Britain during the Blitz.

18:21.548 --> 18:24.259
Yes, but there is a bigger picture here.

18:29.805 --> 18:31.126
Very well.

18:31.246 --> 18:33.678
If those are the orders,
those are the orders.

18:33.798 --> 18:35.953
We'll snatch him up and
take him to the Allies.

18:35.995 --> 18:37.281
Thank you.

18:37.288 --> 18:39.342
So it seems that this

18:39.384 --> 18:41.505
Von Braun will be at the
demonstration tonight.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.420
I can get us past the front door.

18:43.420 --> 18:45.894
Lucy can accompany me as my secretary.

18:46.175 --> 18:48.165
- How do I get in?
- You don't.

18:48.167 --> 18:50.536
You and Rufus can provide
backup from the perimeter.

18:50.553 --> 18:54.372
- She doesn't get in without me.
- I can barely get her in much less you.

18:54.374 --> 18:55.995
Besides, she's a capable operative

18:56.023 --> 18:57.608
just the same as you and I, isn't she?

18:59.391 --> 19:01.839
I'm sorry, but there
simply isn't another way.

19:02.415 --> 19:03.748
He's right.

19:04.484 --> 19:05.750
Then it's settled.

19:06.017 --> 19:07.351
Now, if you'll excuse me.

19:07.567 --> 19:09.581
I'll go and find you a uniform.

19:11.114 --> 19:12.723
If I have a shot at Flynn,

19:12.740 --> 19:13.891
- I have to take it.
- No.

19:13.957 --> 19:15.323
I'm sorry, but not this time.

19:15.373 --> 19:18.090
Von Braun is too important.
After the war, he comes to America

19:18.106 --> 19:19.794
and jumpstarts our
entire rocket program.

19:19.816 --> 19:21.172
He's the guy that gets us to the moon.

19:21.292 --> 19:22.496
NASA's because of him.

19:22.616 --> 19:25.505
- We win the space race because of him.
- And the Cold War. I mean,

19:25.550 --> 19:28.808
- he helped define modern America.
- And he's able to do all this

19:28.864 --> 19:30.635
because the U.S. pardons him.

19:31.011 --> 19:32.610
He never gets punished.

19:33.258 --> 19:34.591
Right?

19:35.869 --> 19:37.196
Yeah.

19:37.889 --> 19:40.025
You know, let... let me
ask you a question here.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.620
If Von Braun is so important to America,

19:43.450 --> 19:45.127
why didn't Flynn just kill him?

20:18.808 --> 20:19.904
Hey.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.244
Don't you know how to knock?

20:26.364 --> 20:27.610
I did.

20:27.803 --> 20:28.943
Twice.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.273
Oh, well...

20:33.294 --> 20:35.300
good for you.

20:35.726 --> 20:37.474
Uh, look , I don't...

20:37.541 --> 20:40.161
- I don't wanna fight about Von Braun.
- Me neither.

20:40.859 --> 20:42.585
Let's talk about something else.

20:43.193 --> 20:44.676
Okay, like what?

20:45.379 --> 20:47.603
Like you putting on a good front,

20:47.880 --> 20:50.281
but I've seen this 1,000
times with 1,000 guys.

20:50.331 --> 20:52.516
- Seen what?
- New soldier in the field.

20:52.715 --> 20:53.927
Freaking out.

20:54.047 --> 20:56.534
I am not freaking out. I...

20:57.121 --> 20:59.456
- I'm not freaking out.
- Guys in your spot,

20:59.638 --> 21:01.453
they got two options.

21:01.573 --> 21:03.046
Get over the hump...

21:03.478 --> 21:04.983
or crack up.

21:11.562 --> 21:12.779
How do I...

21:13.217 --> 21:14.627
Get over the hump?

21:14.694 --> 21:16.941
- You talk about what's bothering you.
- You never talk.

21:17.061 --> 21:18.673
I'm over the hump.

21:29.934 --> 21:31.302
I shouldn't even be here.

21:31.304 --> 21:33.409
Nazi Germany? Yeah, none of us should.

21:33.529 --> 21:34.706
No.

21:34.708 --> 21:35.931
I mean...

21:36.051 --> 21:38.095
when I was a...

21:38.645 --> 21:40.834
A sophomore in college,

21:41.181 --> 21:43.932
I was ready to abandon
the whole history thing.

21:43.943 --> 21:45.725
Really? To do what?

21:46.386 --> 21:47.994
I was driving to

21:48.337 --> 21:51.978
my mom's house to tell her that
I was dropping out of school

21:52.005 --> 21:53.853
to join a band,

21:55.612 --> 21:59.012
and I'm going over the whole speech

21:59.375 --> 22:00.758
in my mind,

22:00.878 --> 22:02.617
don't notice the oil slick on the road,

22:02.656 --> 22:04.737
spin out right into the river.

22:07.729 --> 22:11.580
The car started filling
up with water so fast.

22:11.818 --> 22:13.876
The car shut down, the
doors wouldn't open,

22:13.881 --> 22:15.429
and I'm thinking,

22:15.840 --> 22:17.400
"This is it."

22:18.429 --> 22:21.185
Someone happened by and pulled me out.

22:22.444 --> 22:24.090
But, every since then,

22:24.346 --> 22:27.316
I have always put myself in
situations that I could control.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.777
Right.

22:29.004 --> 22:30.503
I mean, this...

22:31.353 --> 22:32.916
what we're doing, I...

22:35.757 --> 22:38.565
Every time I get in that time machine,

22:39.127 --> 22:40.640
I feel like I am back in that car,

22:40.645 --> 22:44.144
like I am drowning all
over again, and I just...

22:48.538 --> 22:50.745
I don't think I can keep doing this.

22:51.786 --> 22:53.302
How do you keep doing it?

22:53.351 --> 22:55.852
I grew up in West Texas. Dirt poor.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.259
My dad was a world-class
son of a bitch, but

22:58.447 --> 23:00.301
my grandpa Sherwin,

23:00.970 --> 23:02.682
he picked up all the slack.

23:05.922 --> 23:09.614
Matter of fact, he's gotta be less
than 200 miles from here right now.

23:12.165 --> 23:13.476
Younger than me,

23:13.753 --> 23:15.778
in the 101st, killing Nazis.

23:19.163 --> 23:22.112
That's why saving Nazis
or letting Lincoln die,

23:22.112 --> 23:24.137
that's hard for me because...

23:26.118 --> 23:27.941
Feels like I'm letting him down.

23:32.069 --> 23:34.197
He's the reason I fight.

23:34.805 --> 23:36.772
To make him proud.

23:41.357 --> 23:43.105
You wanna know how to keep doing this?

23:43.225 --> 23:45.175
You figure out what
you're fighting for...

23:45.839 --> 23:47.659
and you'll be okay.

23:52.184 --> 23:53.905
Thank you...

23:54.591 --> 23:56.040
for talking.

23:56.523 --> 23:58.525
Even though you're over the hump.

24:00.501 --> 24:01.712
Sure thing...

24:02.100 --> 24:03.699
ma'am.

24:51.149 --> 24:52.847
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.970
Letting Nazis fire rockets at civilians

24:54.989 --> 24:56.162
- is where I draw the line.
- Yeah, well,

24:56.184 --> 24:57.334
that was supposed to fire.

24:57.352 --> 24:59.973
You know, Lucy's whole thing
about not changing history.

25:00.044 --> 25:01.509
This isn't for Lucy.

25:01.522 --> 25:03.863
It's for someone I know in the 101st.

25:18.028 --> 25:21.099
- Where's Von Braun?
- He's down there somewhere.

25:21.630 --> 25:22.958
Trust me.

25:23.318 --> 25:24.624
We'll find him.

25:27.551 --> 25:30.047
Are you serious?

25:31.165 --> 25:32.292
What?

25:37.848 --> 25:38.965
Dude...

25:39.331 --> 25:41.384
James Bond's hitting on Lucy...

25:41.909 --> 25:43.193
And she's into it.

25:43.492 --> 25:44.814
Gotta say,

25:45.146 --> 25:47.038
you're quite good at this.

25:48.526 --> 25:50.739
How did you get involved in
all of it in the first place?

25:50.917 --> 25:52.450
The Blitz.

25:53.728 --> 25:56.915
Surviving them has a way of
changing your perspective.

25:57.035 --> 25:59.438
- You were there when it happened?
- Not just me.

26:00.423 --> 26:02.293
My brother Michael

26:02.537 --> 26:04.656
came to visit me in London. So,

26:04.938 --> 26:07.207
naturally, I dragged him off to the pub.

26:08.031 --> 26:09.088
When we go to the door,

26:09.121 --> 26:11.318
I realized I had forgotten my wallet.

26:11.915 --> 26:13.675
Went back to the car to retrieve it,

26:13.795 --> 26:16.481
and suddenly...

26:17.527 --> 26:19.259
it was day,

26:19.607 --> 26:22.208
and they were pulling me
out from under the rubble.

26:22.513 --> 26:24.278
Pub wasn't there anymore.

26:26.861 --> 26:28.560
Along with...

26:29.113 --> 26:30.496
much of London.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.878
That symbol.

26:46.094 --> 26:47.870
I know that symbol.

26:48.075 --> 26:49.845
I read about it in college.

26:50.262 --> 26:52.556
There's something to do with it

26:52.589 --> 26:54.221
the Catholic Church.

26:54.631 --> 26:56.081
Dead ahead.

27:03.445 --> 27:05.524
Do you think you could catch his eye

27:05.559 --> 27:07.828
and lure him into that
hallway on the left?

27:09.161 --> 27:10.439
- Yes.
- Good.

27:10.559 --> 27:12.564
I'll take the long way
around and meet you there.

27:48.014 --> 27:50.587
I was wondering when you'd get here.

27:51.134 --> 27:52.640
Where's your friend Wyatt?

27:52.640 --> 27:55.356
He dropped in on me
this morning uninvited.

27:55.378 --> 27:56.860
Very rude.

27:57.282 --> 27:59.667
Don't worry. He's close by.

28:00.270 --> 28:02.899
So, this is about Von Braun?

28:03.690 --> 28:06.030
What I don't understand is
why don't you just kill him?

28:08.768 --> 28:10.222
Unless...

28:11.413 --> 28:12.683
you wanna give him to the Soviets?

28:12.686 --> 28:14.938
Killing Von Braun would be easy,

28:15.058 --> 28:16.709
but handing him to the Russians,

28:16.765 --> 28:18.529
assuring they'll win the Cold War,

28:18.533 --> 28:20.567
maybe even be the first to the moon...

28:20.569 --> 28:22.202
far more damaging.

28:22.204 --> 28:23.718
For who?

28:24.072 --> 28:25.338
To Rittenhouse?

28:26.308 --> 28:28.775
- This paranoid delusion of yours?
- They're very real.

28:28.983 --> 28:30.298
I just...

28:31.082 --> 28:34.170
wish you could recognize
there is a greater good here.

28:34.220 --> 28:36.915
Greater good? You've shot Lincoln.

28:37.738 --> 28:40.106
You're helping Nazis.

28:40.150 --> 28:42.054
It sounds insane even saying it,

28:42.076 --> 28:43.393
much less you doing it.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.782
You think I like this?

28:44.964 --> 28:46.901
You think I like helping these bastards?

28:46.935 --> 28:48.577
You think I sleep at night?

28:51.433 --> 28:52.966
One day, you'll understand.

28:52.968 --> 28:55.621
- I'm a patriot.
- You keep telling yourself that.

28:55.887 --> 28:57.631
And, by the way, you're
not getting Von Braun.

28:57.751 --> 28:58.881
What makes you so sure?

28:58.942 --> 29:00.878
Well, for one, the man behind your back.

29:04.541 --> 29:06.765
You found your way to the British spy.

29:07.755 --> 29:10.090
- Love your movies.
- Movies?

29:10.486 --> 29:11.952
You didn't think everywhere you went

29:11.954 --> 29:12.790
we wouldn't come after you?

29:12.818 --> 29:15.075
Oh, that's exactly
what I was counting on.

29:36.903 --> 29:38.835
Hey, they got Lucy.

30:10.385 --> 30:11.929
We gotta get down there now.

30:11.934 --> 30:13.903
- And the plan is?
- Shoot our way in and out.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.575
You wanna talk
alternatives for a minute?

30:15.577 --> 30:17.076
She's gonna be dead in a minute.

30:17.079 --> 30:18.311
We'll be dead in less than a minute

30:18.313 --> 30:19.828
- if we go in there guns blazing.
- Yeah?

30:19.846 --> 30:21.533
You got a better idea?

30:22.801 --> 30:24.018
Yeah.

30:24.986 --> 30:26.934
We're not gonna disarm
this rocket after all.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.023
Don't look so impressed,
it only holds two bullets.

31:24.051 --> 31:25.323
Now, quickly.

31:35.545 --> 31:36.463
Time to go.

31:36.474 --> 31:37.785
We still have to get Von Braun.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.418
Move, move, move!

31:59.355 --> 32:00.788
No windows, no other doors.

32:00.838 --> 32:01.989
- Great.
- We post up here.

32:01.994 --> 32:03.361
Soon as they come through
the door, we shoot.

32:03.383 --> 32:05.162
Wyatt, that's suicide.

32:05.436 --> 32:07.731
All right, but first...

32:08.070 --> 32:09.366
Oh, no, please!

32:09.370 --> 32:11.716
- What the hell are you doing?
- That bastard's rockets

32:11.782 --> 32:13.635
- destroyed London.
- I was just following orders.

32:13.635 --> 32:15.826
He has to pay for what he did.
You give him to the Allies,

32:15.838 --> 32:17.038
that's never gonna happen!

32:17.093 --> 32:19.029
There is right and there's wrong.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.677
Wyatt.

32:23.572 --> 32:24.662
Wyatt!

32:24.729 --> 32:26.350
I agree with him...

32:27.721 --> 32:29.381
but I trust you.

32:29.652 --> 32:31.213
We listen to her. End of story.

32:35.114 --> 32:36.146
Give me the gun.

32:38.417 --> 32:40.450
We really don't have time for this!

32:40.570 --> 32:43.020
Wyatt, they will be
in here in 10 seconds.

32:43.022 --> 32:45.656
- Give me the gun!
- Hold on.

32:45.776 --> 32:47.824
I remember why this
castle is so special.

33:17.466 --> 33:19.857
So you just knew there
was a secret passage there?

33:19.885 --> 33:22.302
In the 1500s, Catholicism
was outlawed here.

33:22.422 --> 33:23.669
So Catholics in that castle

33:23.702 --> 33:25.610
built a network of secret tunnels

33:25.611 --> 33:27.000
to get priests in and out.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.224
Through the fireplaces.

33:30.323 --> 33:32.085
They called 'em "Priest Holes."

33:32.425 --> 33:33.872
How did you know that?

33:35.728 --> 33:37.463
It was in "Skyfall."

33:45.838 --> 33:47.616
How long till you think
the Allies are here?

33:47.627 --> 33:48.723
Fleming made a call.

33:48.767 --> 33:50.156
They should be here any minute.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.591
He doesn't seem worried.

33:53.045 --> 33:55.132
- He looks happy.
- Yeah, wouldn't you?

33:55.165 --> 33:56.731
He knows how valuable he is.

33:56.969 --> 33:59.250
He's gonna get away with
everything he's ever done.

33:59.685 --> 34:01.345
He's gonna live a great life.

34:07.399 --> 34:08.958
Have a question.

34:09.391 --> 34:11.266
Why would I bother talking to...

34:11.387 --> 34:13.181
excuse me, what are you...

34:22.797 --> 34:24.574
I have a question.

34:30.859 --> 34:33.498
Do you ever think about the
people your rockets have hurt?

34:34.362 --> 34:35.545
No.

34:36.409 --> 34:40.293
Tens of thousands of people have died

34:40.683 --> 34:42.422
because of something you created.

34:42.453 --> 34:44.344
My concern is whether the rockets go up,

34:44.346 --> 34:46.194
not where they come down.

34:48.243 --> 34:49.327
Is that so?

34:49.447 --> 34:52.134
If I did care, it would
inhibit me from my goal.

34:53.422 --> 34:54.987
You see...

34:54.989 --> 34:56.904
getting there to the moon,

34:56.926 --> 34:58.697
that's all that matters.

34:59.123 --> 35:01.061
I don't care who provides
me with the means.

35:05.530 --> 35:08.984
I helped invent something
greater than you ever will,

35:09.874 --> 35:12.829
and all I can think about

35:13.299 --> 35:15.722
is the destruction it's doing.

35:16.486 --> 35:18.694
The people it's hurting.

35:19.325 --> 35:22.313
Yeah, but you weren't
thinking about that

35:22.346 --> 35:23.967
when you were creating it.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.652
Because if you did?

35:26.081 --> 35:27.945
You never would have
gone through with it.

35:28.065 --> 35:29.438
Hmm?

35:33.328 --> 35:35.444
I can't believe we pulled this off.

35:36.228 --> 35:37.766
Thanks for getting me over the hump.

35:38.286 --> 35:39.846
Yeah, well, don't get all soft on me.

35:39.874 --> 35:42.320
Flynn's still got a nuke.

35:53.236 --> 35:54.525
Hello.

35:54.696 --> 35:56.152
Hello.

36:00.794 --> 36:02.924
I hope you're right about this.

36:03.323 --> 36:04.651
We are.

36:05.508 --> 36:08.386
Well, I guess this is good-bye.

36:09.581 --> 36:11.363
But maybe not for you.

36:11.833 --> 36:15.374
I might find myself stateside
when all this is over.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.310
I'm sure you will.

36:17.858 --> 36:19.709
Will you be waiting?

36:25.517 --> 36:27.055
Definitely not.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.057
Well...

36:35.394 --> 36:36.760
never say never.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.595
Again.

36:45.586 --> 36:47.103
Seriously?

36:53.272 --> 36:56.659
After we escaped, we handed
Von Braun over to the Allies.

36:57.067 --> 36:58.495
That's...

36:58.497 --> 36:59.640
- What?
- Well, you're...

36:59.679 --> 37:01.947
you've just described, beat by beat,

37:01.970 --> 37:03.578
the plot of "Weapon of Choice."

37:03.579 --> 37:06.336
- What's "Weapon of Choice"?
- The Bond movie.

37:06.727 --> 37:08.481
- Mm, no such movie.
- Yes, there is.

37:08.504 --> 37:10.595
It's the one in the
castle with the rockets.

37:10.715 --> 37:12.609
Uh, Connery's finest,
as far as I'm concerned.

37:12.611 --> 37:15.494
Bond infiltrates the castle,
rescue evil scientist,

37:15.614 --> 37:17.229
with the help of CIA agents

37:17.268 --> 37:19.366
Wyatt, Lucy, and Rufus.

37:19.715 --> 37:22.076
How much you wanna bet Bond
sleeps with Lucy in that one?

37:22.109 --> 37:23.852
Okay, so you're telling
me there's a new Bond movie

37:23.880 --> 37:25.711
- with Sean Connery and we're in it?
- Yeah, but it's not new.

37:25.733 --> 37:27.910
- Came out in, what, '64?
- Well, it's new to me.

37:27.919 --> 37:30.269
Okay, I hate to put a
damper on all the fangirling,

37:30.308 --> 37:32.915
- but did you find any signs of the nuke?
- Nothing.

37:33.327 --> 37:36.014
- Not even radiation traces.
- I don't get it.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.080
If Flynn was gonna use it,

37:37.089 --> 37:38.523
this would have been the perfect time.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.439
Unless he wants to use
it for something else.

37:40.453 --> 37:41.422
Like what?

37:42.786 --> 37:45.646
Well, uh, something
Anthony talked about once,

37:45.655 --> 37:46.850
- but that was...
- Theoretical.

37:46.859 --> 37:48.174
There's no way he even could have.

37:48.245 --> 37:49.971
Could have what?

37:52.688 --> 37:55.429
How long will this battery
you've created last?

37:56.066 --> 37:58.930
If my math is right, and it is...

37:59.811 --> 38:01.555
about 300 years.

38:05.375 --> 38:07.021
All the power you'll ever need

38:07.141 --> 38:08.854
without having to plug in.

38:24.205 --> 38:25.415
Do you have it?

38:28.969 --> 38:31.129
- Rufus...
- I've been risking my life

38:31.629 --> 38:33.984
for Lucy and Wyatt.

38:36.569 --> 38:38.394
I didn't think I had it in me,

38:38.995 --> 38:40.239
but...

38:41.053 --> 38:42.040
I did.

38:43.049 --> 38:44.769
It's because I knew
they'd do the same for me

38:44.780 --> 38:47.196
because I trust them.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.963
Spies can't trust,

38:50.902 --> 38:52.415
and that's not me.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.097
I'm just not wired that way.

38:59.370 --> 39:00.613
I understand,

39:00.871 --> 39:03.606
but you need to
understand how deep I'm in

39:03.608 --> 39:05.487
with these Rittenhouse people.

39:05.876 --> 39:07.311
I need you to be

39:07.687 --> 39:08.940
on my side

39:09.214 --> 39:12.348
just as I've been on
your side all these years.

39:16.163 --> 39:17.522
I can't.

39:20.731 --> 39:22.692
It's wrong.

39:24.139 --> 39:25.697
I'm sorry.

39:38.781 --> 39:40.237
It's late, and there
are impatient people

39:40.264 --> 39:42.077
at the Pentagon waiting on my call.

39:42.455 --> 39:43.951
We have to talk now.

39:44.637 --> 39:46.943
I know how important
it is to stop Flynn,

39:47.196 --> 39:48.381
but God knows how long it's gonna take,

39:48.412 --> 39:50.444
and I am in for all of it,

39:50.621 --> 39:53.194
- but I have terms.
- Saving America isn't good enough?

39:54.243 --> 39:56.142
I have to take a leave
of absence from my job.

39:56.487 --> 39:58.089
I need you to provide a cover story

39:58.111 --> 39:59.613
that explains why I get called away

39:59.617 --> 40:01.050
on short notice at 3:00 a.m.

40:01.086 --> 40:03.140
I'm thinking historical consultant

40:03.149 --> 40:05.128
for Mason Industry's
confidential project.

40:05.181 --> 40:06.372
You guys come up with the paperwork.

40:06.389 --> 40:07.898
- Anything else?
- Yes.

40:08.319 --> 40:10.306
We need to fix history
and get my sister back.

40:10.310 --> 40:11.979
I want Mason's people working on it...

40:11.979 --> 40:13.232
- Or...
- Or else I walk.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.459
And, no, this is not a bluff.

40:17.522 --> 40:19.479
Someone told me, "figure out
what you're fighting for."

40:19.792 --> 40:21.398
Well, I'm fighting for my sister.

41:07.688 --> 41:09.091
Isn't it, Rufus?

41:13.902 --> 41:15.048
Who are you?

41:15.168 --> 41:17.253
Given your recent struggles, we felt

41:17.514 --> 41:20.006
direct intervention was necessary.

41:21.170 --> 41:22.994
You're with Rittenhouse.

41:27.048 --> 41:29.274

- All Connor Mason wants to do
