WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.240
This programme contains
some strong language

00:04.240 --> 00:09.320
The firearm used to kill Colin Foyle
was an M24 sniper rifle, probably
intended for military use.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.240
We have a lead suspect.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.240
This is Robert Dardis.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.840
Logic dictates that it's
a paramilitary shooting.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.400
I think Mrs Foyle
knows more than she's saying.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.040
Do you think Colin
worked for terrorists?

00:24.040 --> 00:26.560
Did your husband only do accounts?

00:26.560 --> 00:30.440
Did he hold on to items of value
for clients?

00:30.440 --> 00:31.680
SHE GASPS

00:31.680 --> 00:32.960
Not that I know of.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.360
We've found a hidden compartment
alongside the spare tyre casing.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.840
So much for a respectable
accountant.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.680
What does that look like to you?

00:47.440 --> 00:49.800
A sort code? Or a date.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.560
That date's come up before.
Why didn't the DCI flag this?

00:53.560 --> 00:55.560
On your knees, both of you.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.240
GUNSHOTS

00:59.240 --> 01:01.720
Why did you tell me
you didn't know Robert Dardis?

01:01.720 --> 01:03.760
He's been driving you
around for five months.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.280
If she is involved, then this
cannot be the work of one person.
We have to track down Dardis.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.120
Morning.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.440
Sir. Ma'am. We think Dardis is
alone. The house is abandoned.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.200
It belonged to his father
and he died seven years ago.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.760
It's about 80 metres through
the trees ahead of us.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.560
I'll lead my team in for
a hard knock through the window.

01:51.560 --> 01:57.040
Once we're in position, you're more
than welcome to join us and watch
from the inner cordon. Thanks. Sir.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.080
Sir!

02:08.080 --> 02:09.240
Sir, be careful.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.520
RADIO: All teams in position.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.680
Armed police! Armed police!
On your knees!

03:16.680 --> 03:18.840
I want your hands
where I can see them!

03:18.840 --> 03:21.800
RADIO: Go, go! Suspect is moving
upstairs. Go, go, go!

03:30.280 --> 03:33.080
RADIO: Suspect's exited the building
on the east side.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.880
HE PANTS

03:43.880 --> 03:45.000
Show me your hands!

03:46.680 --> 03:48.600
Show me your hands now!

03:58.480 --> 04:02.280
Robert Dardis, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of the
murder of Colin Foyle.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.160
You do not have to say anything,

04:04.160 --> 04:07.360
but I must caution you that, if
you do not mention when questioned

04:07.360 --> 04:10.520
something you later rely on in
court, it may harm your defence.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.120
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.040
Nothing underneath.
What about on this side?

04:31.200 --> 04:32.360
Nothing there either.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.160
Try the glovebox.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.040
Boss?

04:52.120 --> 04:54.840
No sign of the rifle? None yet.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.920
We're still looking for his phone.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.880
Let's get the search team in there.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.920
Sierra Romeo four five,
officers cleared to enter.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.320
We've arrested Dardis.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.800
He called me last night,
three times.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.560
What did he say? Well, he was angry.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.880
I've never heard him like that
before. He said that Colin owed him.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.720
Owed him what? I don't know.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.880
And what was your response?
I told him I was calling the police.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.560
So why didn't you?
Well, because he's not a murderer.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.000
Is he?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.040
He injured himself
when he was trying to escape.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.640
We haven't questioned him yet.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.280
There is something else, actually.
Erm...

05:48.120 --> 05:50.600
I got this last night as well.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.160
At first I thought it was Dardis,
but it's from a different number.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.000
Is this someone pretending
to be my husband?

05:58.280 --> 06:01.760
You were mentioning about
burner phones and code names.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.560
Could this be connected?

06:03.560 --> 06:06.120
You've heard no mention
of gold before? No.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.040
There was talk of gold,
a while back.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.400
You're sure you've never
heard of it before? No.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.040
Did your husband
ever mention Goliath?

06:19.040 --> 06:20.760
Why Goliath?

06:20.760 --> 06:23.560
He was an assassin, the real deal.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.200
He may have been a client
of your husband's.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.800
Yeah, no, I haven't.
So is this message from him?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.680
No. He's dead.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.520
I led the investigation into finding
him. His real name was Pat Keenan.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.400
So who sent this?

06:42.840 --> 06:44.280
I did.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.000
What? I needed to make sure.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.200
If you hadn't told me about it,
we'd have known something was up.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.760
So, what, like a test?
You're joking. We have to
find your husband's killer.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.480
Yeah, but you said you weren't...
I told you you wouldn't be
wrongly accused of the crime.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.800
That doesn't mean you
won't be investigated.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.040
Oh, Olivia...

07:07.400 --> 07:09.440
..you did the right thing.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.400
It was submitted to evidence.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.400
You didn't say anything about it.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.200
It had to be examined.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.760
What about the final page?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.480
What about it?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.520
What do you make of this?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.320
A sort code of some kind.

07:57.560 --> 08:02.320
If you turn the numbers around,
you get the 21st of February, 1998.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.760
OK.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.080
The first Goliath disappearance
was reported on that day.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.520
I know.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.600
You don't think that's significant?

08:11.600 --> 08:13.960
This could point
to the Goliath case.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.280
Goliath is dead.

08:16.280 --> 08:19.280
That doesn't stop him being
a lead in Foyle's murder.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.720
I hate to say it, but he's right.

08:22.720 --> 08:26.360
The circumstantial evidence
against Pat Keenan is strong.

08:26.360 --> 08:29.800
As far as we're concerned,
Pat Keenan was Goliath.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.600
Pat Keenan is dead
and so Goliath is dead.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.440
Then why are we so reluctant

08:34.440 --> 08:36.920
to involve his name
in this investigation?

08:36.920 --> 08:40.440
We're not reluctant -
we're just not going to.

08:40.440 --> 08:44.000
Sir...!
I have your best interests at heart.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.600
The seniors see the Goliath case
as a clusterfuck

08:48.600 --> 08:51.760
of convenient killings,
losing a valuable witness

08:51.760 --> 08:53.760
and blaming the dead guy.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.640
We can't let that happen again.
But there's no reason
to think it would, sir.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.880
Risk assessment...

09:01.840 --> 09:05.360
..stating that there's a serious
threat to the life of Robert Dardis.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.800
Anything happens to him and the
spotlight swings right back on us.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.120
HE SIGHS

09:13.760 --> 09:15.120
Drop the Goliath angle.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.040
It's unnecessary.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.240
Focus on gathering enough evidence
to put Dardis away for murder.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.000
What were you doing
at the Foyle house?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.440
I, erm...

09:32.440 --> 09:34.800
..came to take Mrs Foyle
to the airport.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.640
Why did you run?

09:36.640 --> 09:39.720
There was a woman with a gun.
I was scared.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.360
Why did you hide?

09:44.040 --> 09:47.320
Were you and Mrs Foyle close, Rob?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.640
You find her attractive, don't you?

09:49.640 --> 09:52.040
Your friend, Davy,
told us that much.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.080
She says you make her
feel uncomfortable.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.160
I'm sure she does.
Is it more of a two-way thing?

10:00.480 --> 10:03.640
This is your black...

10:03.640 --> 10:08.520
..BMW, registration uniform, echo,
Zulu, three, two, eight, one.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.680
I rent it from the company.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.960
And why would you disconnect
the GPS tracker

10:13.960 --> 10:16.560
that all your company cars
have installed?

10:17.920 --> 10:21.240
Do you go places you don't want
people to know about, Rob?

10:22.840 --> 10:25.040
I spoke to Mrs Foyle earlier.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.520
She says that last night
you called her

10:28.520 --> 10:31.520
one, two, three times
from this unidentified number.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.040
You said Colin Foyle
owed you something.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.880
She's lying.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.320
No.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.480
This is a concealed compartment
inside Colin Foyle's car.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.320
We believe he used it
to move money, a lot of it.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.240
Did he owe you money?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.760
We're aware of your
financial situation.

10:51.760 --> 10:55.600
Rob, we know you and your wife
both work several jobs

10:55.600 --> 10:56.960
to make the monthly payments.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.640
That's got to be tough.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.360
We spoke to Sandra.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.280
She loves you very much.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.360
Says you're a great daddy
to your wee boy.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.400
Was the financial pressure too much?

11:15.400 --> 11:18.960
Was stealing from a bent
accountant your best bet?

11:18.960 --> 11:22.320
Or did someone else
convince you to kill him?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.360
What was your job in the army?

11:28.280 --> 11:30.160
I was a driver.

11:31.160 --> 11:34.800
Says here you had infantry training.
Did that involve sniper training?

11:36.280 --> 11:38.920
Tours of Afghanistan and Iraq.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.880
No stranger to combat.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.880
You'd know what an M24 rifle was.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.360
How to operate it.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.080
We should probably move on
to social services.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.400
What have they got to do
with anything?

11:57.400 --> 12:00.680
If we can connect you
to this shooting, Rob,
which we think we can,

12:00.680 --> 12:03.040
they might want to take
your wee boy away.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.800
They can't do that.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.120
Well, they will if we raise concerns
about his wellbeing or safety.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.560
DCI Brannick...
We'd be well within our rights.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.240
What if there are reprisals for this
attack? Sir... They can fucking try!

12:26.160 --> 12:27.200
Incoming.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.320
Is it true?

12:38.960 --> 12:42.520
Did you threaten Robert Dardis with
losing his son to social services?

12:42.520 --> 12:46.160
I could see that he was vulnerable
when we talked about... Is it true?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.920
What happened, Tom?

12:51.920 --> 12:55.000
Too many concussions on the
rugby pitch? Dardis is involved.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.120
Dardis will walk free because you
played into the solicitor's hands.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.600
Oppression. Inducement.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.440
She can take her pick.

13:04.440 --> 13:08.080
He called Olivia Foyle several
times throughout the night.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.040
Was there a handset or a SIM
recovered from the siege?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.680
No, sir.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.000
So it remains
an unidentified number.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It's her word against his.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.560
I, erm...

13:19.560 --> 13:22.640
I wouldn't trust either of them.
My point.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.000
He ran from us!

13:24.000 --> 13:28.160
Well, he's footloose and fancy-free
now because we can't
legally keep him here.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.960
Well, that's ridiculous.
No, Tom, it's the law.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.160
And now we have a very expensive,
resource-heavy operation run

13:34.160 --> 13:36.280
just to keep the bastard safe!

13:38.760 --> 13:42.080
And seeing as how you made this
mess, it's up to you to sort it out.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.000
No... You'll need cameras
on his house for surveillance.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.480
I have a murder investigation...
You'll need a TSG team to
protect him. I see what this is.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.760
You're under pressure from above.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.360
Word is out that we have
a former soldier in custody

13:55.360 --> 13:58.040
and some politician has taken
exception. Is that it?

13:58.040 --> 14:00.720
Sometimes I think you forget
where you're standing.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.200
And I don't just mean
in front of a senior officer.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.640
I mean the fucking island
underneath your feet!

14:09.600 --> 14:12.080
Colin Foyle was a careful man.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.360
There's no trace
of an illegal operation
on his computer or in his files.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.400
No loose ends, until this.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.600
Any luck with these entries, Birdy?

14:19.600 --> 14:21.240
Not yet, sir.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.720
He nurses his wife
through ill health.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.120
After her death,
nearly two years ago,

14:27.120 --> 14:30.320
takes himself off to New York,
where he meets Olivia Deegan.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.640
They get married three months later.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.600
Fast work. Who proposed? He did.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.000
His Facebook post at the time reads,
"I can't believe she said yes."

14:39.000 --> 14:41.280
Then two exclamation marks.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.640
People who know him say
he's not one to flash the cash,

14:44.640 --> 14:47.800
but this house says otherwise.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.400
The new Mrs Foyle said she
encouraged him to buy it.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.640
By all accounts,
he was obsessed with her.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.560
So if she's driving the spending,

14:55.560 --> 14:58.120
do you think half
the money wasn't enough?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.560
I don't think she pulled
the trigger.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.320
The M24 rifle.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.600
It's serious, serious kit.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.080
High-powered,
very accurate in the right hands.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.960
A trained sniper will aim
at the chest from distance.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.560
Dardis fits the bill.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.720
KNOCK ON DOOR

15:14.720 --> 15:17.800
Sarge. Ops Hub say they're
ready on the Dardis move.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.600
Oh, thanks, Judith.
And your daughter's here, sir.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.840
Oh, cheers.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.560
It's the rifle. We need to find it.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.600
What are you doing here?
Need your signature to get
the mortgage approved, don't I?

15:35.600 --> 15:38.000
You didn't need to come all
the way down here for that.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.360
I trust you not to lose this
underneath all the other shite
that you've got going on.

15:41.360 --> 15:45.560
We're buying a house.
Now sign on the dotted line
so I can take you to the cleaners.

15:45.560 --> 15:50.360
Anyone ever tell you
that you are a bully?
I had a good role model growing up.

15:50.360 --> 15:54.320
Erm, I'm going to be working through
the night. How are you getting back?

15:54.320 --> 15:55.360
Train.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.200
No, no, no. Take a cab.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.000
I'll get one of my many minions
to organise it. Birdy!

16:03.680 --> 16:05.560
Come on! Sir?

16:05.560 --> 16:09.280
Can you look after Izzy,
make sure she gets home?

16:09.280 --> 16:10.320
Yeah, absolutely.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.640
I'm sorry. It's hectic here.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.680
No worries. I got what I came for.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.640
Excuse me. Hi, Izzy.
Hi. See you down there, sir.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.720
Yeah, I'll just be one sec.
Come and see me soon, eh?

16:21.720 --> 16:23.080
When the money runs out!

16:26.400 --> 16:28.360
Ah, I forgot my coat.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.960
How's it going?

16:45.080 --> 16:47.520
DC Ruddy, I need you
and your partner

16:47.520 --> 16:50.200
to head out to the safe houses
to provide overwatch.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.040
You take Lima.
Get your partner on Juliette.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.080
Sir.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.440
I have three older brothers,
so I'm the baby. That must be nice.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.280
I get bossed around a wee bit.
Kind of like in here.

17:03.280 --> 17:07.680
Mind you, I'd take a bollocking
from Jackie any day over rounds
in the kitchen with my ma!

17:07.680 --> 17:10.880
You just wait in here. Cab won't
be more than 15 minutes. Thanks.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.880
I was going to ask... What?

17:15.840 --> 17:17.880
Nothing, sorry. No, go on.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.400
I was going to say, ask,

17:22.400 --> 17:24.800
and only if you wanted to,
of course...

17:26.040 --> 17:29.320
..a drink, maybe, at some point?

17:30.680 --> 17:33.640
Billy Bird,
are you asking me on a date?

17:35.040 --> 17:36.800
Would that be good?

17:37.920 --> 17:39.720
My dad's your boss.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.040
Aye.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.000
So would that be bad?

17:45.240 --> 17:48.320
That would be bad, wouldn't it?
No, no, no. That would be good.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.560
Yeah? Erm...

17:52.520 --> 17:54.360
..what time do you finish work?

17:55.720 --> 17:57.760
Why not after this?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.080
Cancel the cab.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.720
I've got cash.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.560
In that case, aye. Class.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.560
Grand. I'll wait in here, then.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.760
I'll go call the cab company.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.680
OK. OK.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.920
That's the last of it.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.400
Here he comes.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.600
I remind you that we have
the TSG team on task here

19:52.600 --> 19:54.240
for your protection.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.680
Cameras will also be installed
for your security. Yeah, right.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.360
You shot him, didn't you?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.440
Worth a try.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.080
One concealed camera at
the front of the house,

20:29.080 --> 20:30.800
one at the back.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.160
The TSG team will rotate with
another team every couple of hours.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.200
Good work.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.360
Mmm.

21:11.280 --> 21:15.480
Mum, can I have the TV on?
Ten minutes and that's it.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.280
Thank you.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.600
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

21:31.480 --> 21:32.880
Olivia.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.680
Where's the gold?

21:34.680 --> 21:37.040
I'm still not going to tell you.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.760
This is my insurance policy now.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.520
All right. Just, erm...

21:45.800 --> 21:47.320
..stay calm.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.080
They don't have any evidence on us.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.840
We're going to be grand.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.560
We're in this together, Rob.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.760
You told lies about me, though.
Didn't you?

22:00.520 --> 22:02.240
What did you say?

22:04.440 --> 22:06.600
Olivia, what did you say?

22:08.240 --> 22:10.320
They're playing you, Rob.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.280
Don't make it easy for them.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.040
SHE HANGS UP

23:13.960 --> 23:15.760
Rob, what is it?

23:21.960 --> 23:24.200
Daddy! There's a fire!

23:26.480 --> 23:27.840
Daddy!

23:27.840 --> 23:30.240
Get dressed, both of you!

23:37.880 --> 23:40.080
Someone lobbed a fucking
petrol bomb at our shed!

23:40.080 --> 23:43.080
The Fire Service is on its way.
You need to come with me.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.800
Where's air support?
Don't know, boss. Get on to them.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.040
And keep an eye on the back gate.
Quickly now.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.640
Let's go, come on. What's going on?
Go on, love. I'm behind you. Go on.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.000
What's happening?

23:53.000 --> 23:55.320
Go on, love, go ahead.
You're all right.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.200
DS McGovern!

23:58.400 --> 24:01.040
Take that. OK. All right?
Just wait here. Wait.

24:02.600 --> 24:06.040
What is going on? You're coming
with me. The fuck I am.

24:06.040 --> 24:09.360
We need to go now, Sarge.
This is a targeted attack, Rob.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.200
There's at least a dozen pairs
of eyes on what you do next.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.120
You are the target.
If you're all together,

24:15.120 --> 24:18.240
there's a greater risk
of your family getting hurt.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.000
Rob!

24:21.560 --> 24:24.080
I'll see you later, OK?
What's going on, Rob?

24:24.080 --> 24:27.400
It's safer, all right? I love you.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.920
You're with me.
You, stick to procedure.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.000
Daddy, I'm scared.
Be a soldier, right?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.440
You take of your mummy,
all right? Copy?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.000
Daddy, don't leave us, please.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.360
Daddy.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.520
Go, go.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.480
You all right?

24:54.480 --> 24:55.840
You owe somebody money?

24:57.320 --> 24:59.040
Making sure my daddy's not there?

25:00.160 --> 25:01.440
Sorry.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.360
It's OK, Birdy.

25:03.360 --> 25:07.360
But you're off-duty. I'd rather
it wasn't the theme of the night.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.680
I won't do it again.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.920
I just... I respect your da.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.000
A lot.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.960
Sometimes I look at him and I think,

25:16.960 --> 25:18.480
"I could never be like that,

25:18.480 --> 25:20.320
"as good as that."

25:21.520 --> 25:23.800
You're chasing the wrong Brannick.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.120
So has it always just
been the two of you?

25:28.120 --> 25:30.240
Your da never
had any girlfriends, no?

25:30.240 --> 25:31.960
Really, Birdy, he's not into you.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.120
Forget it. I'm having you on.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.880
Erm, there were none that lasted.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.520
I'd hoped that, erm...

25:41.920 --> 25:44.720
It doesn't matter.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.640
What? Nothing.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.520
I'd hoped that one of them would
become something, that's all.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.120
Tori Matthews?

25:59.280 --> 26:01.120
She seemed kind of...

26:02.520 --> 26:05.840
..well, too good to be
true, if I'm honest.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.880
I didn't know that they were...
Daddy wanted to play it down.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.960
How is he?

26:11.960 --> 26:14.000
Your da? Seems grand.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.080
Can be a bit funny
this time of year.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.600
Around the time that
my mummy disappeared.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.400
I worry that...

26:28.840 --> 26:32.040
It's only ever been about
me since then, for him.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.080
And now I'm getting
my own house and...

26:37.040 --> 26:38.960
You're only in Belfast.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.880
Try telling him that.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.440
I just wonder what he'll
do now, you know?

26:47.560 --> 26:49.760
He needs a goal.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.320
He's, erm...

26:52.920 --> 26:54.600
..driven.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.320
Obsessive.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.000
Something like that, yeah.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.360
DC Ruddy, I have one guest. Sarge.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.040
Who do you think it is?

27:20.040 --> 27:21.760
Depends.

27:21.760 --> 27:25.040
Who wants revenge
for Colin Foyle's murder?

27:25.040 --> 27:27.640
Or who wants your silence?

27:27.640 --> 27:29.360
No-one you can think of, no?

27:32.120 --> 27:33.840
In you go.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.160
I'll be outside if you need me.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.240
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

28:04.800 --> 28:06.720
You OK? Yeah.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.840
The protection team took Dardis'
wife and son to House Juliet.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.320
I took Dardis himself
to House Lima.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.240
Are you with him now?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.440
No, I'm moving to Juliet

28:16.440 --> 28:19.680
to make sure the team
are properly debriefed.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.440
Have you alerted the Int Hub?
Yeah.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.800
OK.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.280
Sounds like you've
got it under control.

28:26.280 --> 28:29.360
Do you need anything from me?
Erm, no, I don't think so.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.080
But it looks like you
might be right, boss,

28:34.080 --> 28:36.520
about possible
paramilitary involvement.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.640
OK. Call me if the
situation changes.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.680
KNOCK ON DOOR

30:05.840 --> 30:07.640
KNOCK ON DOOR

30:28.640 --> 30:30.080
Listen to me carefully.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.760
Your family is safe.
My DS is with them now.

30:32.760 --> 30:36.960
But there's another problem.
We think there's a leak in our unit.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.400
Are you serious?

30:38.400 --> 30:40.960
Colin was an accountant
to the worst kind of people.

30:40.960 --> 30:44.600
They're after you. They've an
insider feeding them information.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.800
You need to come with me.
I can keep you safe.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.880
Have you got a phone on you?

31:00.880 --> 31:03.360
Aye. Give it to me.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.880
I need to turn it off.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.920
I can't afford a new smartphone.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.560
Come on.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.640
Where are we going?

31:39.640 --> 31:42.520
Another safe house.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.960
One your insider doesn't know about?

31:44.960 --> 31:46.720
Uh-huh.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.240
Wait.

32:18.360 --> 32:21.160
Are we not going in?
My DS is bringing the key.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.400
She'll be a few minutes yet.

32:57.960 --> 33:01.480
Did you know Colin Foyle worked
for a criminal organisation, Rob?

33:05.040 --> 33:06.440
Now is the time to tell me.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.760
Witness protection, relocation,
we can do all that for you.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.760
If you just give us something.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.960
Come on.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.440
She can't have that much
of a hold over you. What?

33:22.440 --> 33:25.080
Olivia Foyle.
She's obviously pulling the strings.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.240
You don't see it?

33:29.240 --> 33:32.400
Where is she right now? Tucked up
in her bed at home. Where are you?

33:33.680 --> 33:36.000
She's hanging you out to dry, Rob.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.880
Do you take instruction from her?

33:42.200 --> 33:45.000
Is that why you keep calling her?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.760
We're not talking about this.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.720
Or is it something else?

33:55.280 --> 33:57.000
Do you love her?

34:01.200 --> 34:03.200
Christ, are you stupid, man?

34:03.200 --> 34:04.560
Shut up.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.200
What, a nice wee bit of South Dublin
skirt flutters your eyelashes at you

34:08.200 --> 34:10.240
and you go all Bonnie and Clyde? No.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.440
So what was it?

34:14.840 --> 34:17.520
No sex until you murder the husband?
Fuck you!

34:22.120 --> 34:24.200
Did she tell you
where to find the rifle?

34:25.240 --> 34:27.000
Stop asking questions.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.960
Did she order you? Are you deaf?

34:33.960 --> 34:35.960
I bet you love taking
orders, don't you?

34:37.560 --> 34:39.360
What's that supposed to mean?

34:39.360 --> 34:42.080
Well, you know, something
you're not getting at home.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.760
Does your wife know?

34:46.760 --> 34:47.920
Your son?

34:51.800 --> 34:53.280
Is that eating you up inside?

34:56.400 --> 34:58.760
I'm not listening to this.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.440
If you had access to the rifle,
you had access to the gold.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.000
What?

35:13.120 --> 35:14.520
Well...

35:15.680 --> 35:17.920
..that's what this is really about.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.640
How do you know about...
How do I know?

35:26.200 --> 35:27.840
Did you take it from her husband?

35:29.120 --> 35:30.880
Did she get you to hide it?

35:32.400 --> 35:34.320
Where's your DS?

35:34.320 --> 35:35.760
Where did you put it, Rob?

35:37.200 --> 35:39.880
She's not coming, is she?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.600
Answer the question.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.720
I know where the gold is.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.480
And you don't. How do you know that?

35:50.560 --> 35:52.400
I helped Colin move it.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.920
And then you killed him.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.920
The man lost his nerve.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.160
Why?

35:59.160 --> 36:02.920
He got some information
that the gold belonged to the IRA.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.960
He panicked. And did what? Nothing.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.200
I told him that some
ex-IRA fella wanted a meeting.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.520
That's how you lured him.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.480
If you kill me, you've got nothing.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.640
You're fucked.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.440
You know, Colin thought
it was a police officer.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.040
Then that ex-IRA fella gets
killed. What was his name?

36:33.040 --> 36:34.120
Pat Keenan.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.880
Everyone thought it was him.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.440
But it wasn't, was it?

36:44.520 --> 36:48.360
Be careful, Rob. That's why Colin
hired me to be security for him.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.400
He knew you were still alive.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.920
I'm warning you.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.640
Warn away.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.080
You and I both know...

37:01.120 --> 37:03.240
..there's nothing you can do.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.880
Not if you want your gold back.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.080
Now, let's get back in the car...

37:12.120 --> 37:14.160
..Goliath.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.720
Fuck.

39:15.760 --> 39:18.400
Sorry if I got a wee bit heavy.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.840
Don't be.
I like spending time with you.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.400
Really?

39:24.400 --> 39:26.960
Oh, is that weird? No, I do too.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.400
What?

39:33.400 --> 39:35.520
Nothing.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.440
Just... That's pretty great.

39:40.680 --> 39:44.320
It's a bit late for you to be
going back to Belfast now. Aye.

39:44.320 --> 39:47.360
Oh, I'm not... I'm not
suggesting you stay at mine.

39:47.360 --> 39:50.360
I didn't...
I mean, of course you're welcome to.

39:50.360 --> 39:54.440
I do actually have a spare bed
that I could... No, no, it's...

39:54.440 --> 39:57.240
It's OK. I can stay with Daddy.
It's not far. Ah, course.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.680
I would like to do
this again though.

40:04.160 --> 40:07.040
Just so we're clear.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.840
So would I.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.120
I'll... Walk me to a cab?

40:23.120 --> 40:25.400
I'll walk you to a cab.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.320
Are you not back in Belfast?
I decided to catch up with a friend.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.720
You become OCD all of a sudden?

41:42.720 --> 41:44.560
Oh, no, I...

41:44.560 --> 41:47.920
I spilled coffee and decided
to give it a full valet.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.920
Hey. I tried ringing you.
Is your mobile off?

41:50.920 --> 41:53.560
No, you know what the
signal is like here.

41:53.560 --> 41:54.880
You OK?

41:56.120 --> 41:59.040
Yeah, yeah. Erm, here,
make yourself useful. Go on.

42:12.080 --> 42:15.960
After everything that happened and,
you know, who Tori really was and...

42:17.480 --> 42:21.680
..so determined to, like, dig up
the past, no matter the cost...

42:23.920 --> 42:26.240
..I was thinking, you know...

42:27.640 --> 42:30.960
..maybe it's for the best
if we put some more...

42:32.240 --> 42:33.840
..distance between us and that.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.120
It's probably a wee bit late for me.

42:40.440 --> 42:43.080
I'll get another bottle of wine.
You sure? Aye.

42:46.760 --> 42:48.560
Did you ever think about leaving?

42:50.840 --> 42:52.640
Putting this all behind you.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.080
No.

43:05.640 --> 43:08.760
No, it's the...
It's the next one along.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.920
But, no, didn't think of leaving.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.720
You were here.

43:19.920 --> 43:23.960
Mum and Dad were here,
which was helpful with you.

43:23.960 --> 43:25.640
My life was here.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.720
Believe it or not,
even after everything that happened,

43:29.720 --> 43:31.680
this is still my home.

43:32.840 --> 43:34.600
I'm part of it.

43:36.600 --> 43:37.720
And maybe...

43:39.120 --> 43:41.920
..a wee bit of me thought that,
you know, if we stayed...

43:43.080 --> 43:44.960
..as long as you and I were here,

43:44.960 --> 43:46.600
then your mother would...

43:51.320 --> 43:53.120
..she would know her way back to us.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.080
Sleep well.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.640
Daddy? Yeah?

44:15.040 --> 44:16.680
Have they made a connection yet?

44:18.480 --> 44:20.400
Between Pat Keenan and Mummy?

44:21.560 --> 44:22.800
No.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.720
No, they haven't.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.800
Get some sleep.

45:43.840 --> 45:45.520
Morning. Morning.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.240
PHONE MESSAGE:
Detective Constable Bird,

45:52.240 --> 45:54.560
this is Alan from Safe House
and Home Storage.

45:54.560 --> 45:58.160
You left a wee message yesterday
asking if we have a unit number 174.

45:58.160 --> 46:00.040
Well, we do indeed.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.800
SHSS is a Safe House
and Home Storage

46:07.800 --> 46:09.560
in Whiteside Industrial Estate.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.600
I just got off the phone with them.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.600
Units 174, 175 and 176 are all
registered to Colin Foyle.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.480
Get a search party together.
We'll meet them there.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.800
176.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.360
175.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.120
174. Thanks, mate.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.840
OK. These all belong
to Foyle. Open the lot.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.560
Mr Dardis?

47:17.200 --> 47:18.840
Shit.

47:24.400 --> 47:26.880
Just more furniture.

47:45.840 --> 47:48.040
What would have gone in those holes?

47:48.040 --> 47:49.640
By the looks of it, another rifle.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.960
We need to bring Olivia Foyle in.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.920
Sir?

47:59.400 --> 48:01.480
Sir?

48:01.480 --> 48:04.000
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

48:06.400 --> 48:07.600
Brannick.

48:07.600 --> 48:09.800
Sir, Dardis has gone missing.

48:09.800 --> 48:12.800
How could you let this happen?
I thought he was secure.

48:12.800 --> 48:15.480
We were headed there straight
after the storage facility.

48:15.480 --> 48:19.240
It's not her fault.
As far as I can see the DS
ran a well-executed operation.

48:19.240 --> 48:22.280
Have we spoken to Dardis' family
to see if he's been in touch?

48:22.280 --> 48:24.960
Sir, Birdy's been
trying to get a location

48:24.960 --> 48:27.160
on the phone Dardis had on him.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.960
I thought we didn't recover a phone.

48:29.920 --> 48:32.280
His wife says he had
a cheap replacement.

48:33.640 --> 48:36.760
Right. Well, if it was a smartphone,
we'd have more luck.

48:36.760 --> 48:40.480
The last triangulated location on
this one hadn't zeroed in precisely.

48:40.480 --> 48:42.840
It had him anywhere
in the Strangford area.

48:42.840 --> 48:46.440
Well, he can't have got far,
not with the injury he's carrying.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.640
Unless he had help.

48:48.840 --> 48:51.040
What about the storage facility?

48:51.040 --> 48:55.880
Storage unit 174 had two large rifle
cases and one M24 sniper rifle.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.440
The murder weapon?

48:57.440 --> 49:00.480
The CSI say the rifle is brand-new.
It's never been fired.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.560
But the presence of two cases
suggests there's a rifle missing.

49:03.560 --> 49:06.200
So now we have a missing weapon
and a missing person.

49:06.200 --> 49:08.200
For fuck's sake!

49:08.200 --> 49:10.560
We wouldn't be in this situation
were it not for you, sir.

49:11.760 --> 49:13.640
Come again?

49:13.640 --> 49:15.080
No, no, no, get it off your chest.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.720
Well, it's not the first time
you've put keeping the peace

49:18.720 --> 49:21.000
before the pursuit of justice.
I might have known.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.640
Well, the truth is, you're a
politician first

49:23.640 --> 49:25.360
and a policeman after.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.480
The difference
between you and me, Tom,

49:27.480 --> 49:30.360
is that I understand the balance
needed to do this job.

49:30.360 --> 49:33.280
Mm. And now there's
an even bigger mess to deal with.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.440
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

49:38.600 --> 49:41.600
I'm so sorry, sir.
Could have happened to anyone.

49:41.600 --> 49:44.200
Get out to the house,
see if you can pick up a trail.

49:44.200 --> 49:47.480
Birdy, you can help with the
Olivia Foyle interview. Sir.

50:07.120 --> 50:10.000
We should document everywhere Dardis
has been in the last ten days.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.040
Work backwards from his
hideout in the woods.

50:12.040 --> 50:13.840
We'll go to every
location if we have to.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.800
Use ANPR, CCTV,
everything at our disposal.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.320
Sir.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.160
That's the storage facility.

50:24.160 --> 50:27.440
48 hours after her husband's murder.

50:27.440 --> 50:29.880
And just after we
questioned her at the station.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.680
Room two.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.600
Mrs Foyle's solicitor is stuck in
traffic, so he might be a wee while.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.680
Thanks, Birdy. You ready for this?

51:02.680 --> 51:05.320
Absolutely. It's a step up.

51:05.320 --> 51:08.120
Don't disappoint me. I won't.

51:08.120 --> 51:10.080
Go get yourself prepped.
Thanks, sir.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.760
Sir. Sir.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.560
We're still waiting
on your solicitor.

52:20.560 --> 52:23.080
OK.

52:28.920 --> 52:30.760
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

52:48.920 --> 52:50.760
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

53:03.360 --> 53:04.760
There's that gold again.

53:07.440 --> 53:08.800
Wasn't from you this time?

53:12.160 --> 53:15.440
Rob Dardis has been using
a burner phone with this number.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.280
This is from him.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.600
He's gone missing. Missing?

53:22.760 --> 53:24.720
We had him in a safe house...

53:26.040 --> 53:27.880
..but he's on the run.

53:29.040 --> 53:31.360
But why would he message me this?

53:34.560 --> 53:36.680
Maybe he wants to make a deal?

53:42.400 --> 53:45.120
Do you think he's coming for me?

53:45.120 --> 53:46.640
Too risky.

53:52.520 --> 53:53.960
The question is...

53:57.080 --> 53:58.240
..where would he hide it?

54:02.280 --> 54:03.680
You could help me.

54:04.840 --> 54:06.680
"Help" you? Uh-huh.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.640
Find it.

54:18.080 --> 54:20.800
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.840
Help you, or...

54:23.840 --> 54:25.520
..the police?

54:28.440 --> 54:30.440
Same thing. Is it?

54:37.200 --> 54:41.840
Cos you're not tempted by
the idea of the gold, are you?

54:45.200 --> 54:47.120
They can't pay you enough.

54:48.440 --> 54:50.080
They don't.

54:57.680 --> 54:59.240
Still...

55:00.520 --> 55:03.160
..no reason to undertake
anything illegal.

55:20.960 --> 55:23.000
It's not going to happen.

55:26.280 --> 55:28.160
But if it did...

55:31.320 --> 55:33.720
..you'd have something more.

55:38.480 --> 55:40.920
But you don't know
where the gold is.

55:45.400 --> 55:47.520
You have nothing to offer.

55:49.920 --> 55:51.440
Don't I?

55:53.640 --> 55:56.880
I am very good at keeping secrets.
