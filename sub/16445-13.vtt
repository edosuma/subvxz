You talk of hate and revenge,

00:10.710 --> 00:12.510
but you still love James Gordon.

00:12.545 --> 00:15.513
I hope she knows what a
lying cheat you are, Maria.

00:15.548 --> 00:17.348
I had to leave, or they
were gonna take me to prison.

00:17.383 --> 00:19.183

00:19.218 --> 00:20.051

02:42.578 --> 02:44.911
It seems after shutting down
Indian Hill, the government

02:45.097 --> 02:47.330
just packed everything
up and shipped it here.

02:47.366 --> 02:49.966
To a Wayne Enterprises facility.

02:50.002 --> 02:52.169
They sent it back to the
same people who were running

02:52.204 --> 02:54.237
Indian Hill and funding
Strange to begin with?

02:54.273 --> 02:55.639
Yep.

02:55.674 --> 02:57.874
Do we know how Jerome
ended up at Indian Hill?

02:57.910 --> 02:59.543
No, but it makes sense.

02:59.578 --> 03:01.178
Strange was collecting
psychopaths, right?

03:01.213 --> 03:03.814
Fish, Galavan. Jerome fit the bill.

03:03.849 --> 03:07.584
The woman that walked out of the
morgue, that was Dwight's trial run.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.121
- He's gonna bring back Jerome.
- Oh, that's great.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.091
That's all this city needs...
Jerome Valeska sucking air with

03:14.126 --> 03:16.160

- Lucius.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.564
If you wanted to bring back
someone from one of these,

03:20.599 --> 03:22.166
what would be your next step?

03:22.201 --> 03:25.235
Thawing 'em out. These
pods run at 237 degrees

03:25.271 --> 03:28.105
below zero. You'd have to get
the body to core temperature

03:28.140 --> 03:30.107
before even attempting reanimation.

03:30.142 --> 03:32.443
I worked on the design of
these when I was at Wayne.

03:32.478 --> 03:34.478
Oh, good job. Thanks
for helping the bad guys.

03:34.513 --> 03:35.913
How long?

03:35.948 --> 03:37.481

03:37.516 --> 03:38.649

03:48.961 --> 03:52.596
GCPD. You're under arrest.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.001
He needs a hospital.

04:00.339 --> 04:02.773
No.

04:08.781 --> 04:11.915
Appreciate you boys seeing me so late.

04:11.951 --> 04:14.751
Doesn't seem like we had much of
a choice, Mr. Clemens, does it?

04:14.787 --> 04:16.920
Please, call me Cole.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.156
You want money.

04:20.237 --> 04:22.359
That bitch, Maria Kyle,

04:23.526 --> 04:25.472
she owes me 200 grand.

04:25.507 --> 04:26.635
I heard 100.

04:26.670 --> 04:29.967
Well, you got to figure
gas money coming out here

04:30.002 --> 04:31.435
and, uh...

04:31.470 --> 04:32.970
Well... (chuckles)

04:33.005 --> 04:34.638
think you can afford it?

04:34.673 --> 04:37.477
ALFRED: And what exactly
is the nature of this debt?

04:37.512 --> 04:41.044
Call it lost income due
to a broken contract.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.146
She said she'd do something.

04:43.182 --> 04:44.882
She didn't.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.451
Ergo, she owes me the
money I would've made,

04:47.486 --> 04:49.486
- plus interest.
- Or what?

04:49.522 --> 04:51.288
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:51.323 --> 04:53.490
I would never hurt a woman.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.359
However,

04:55.394 --> 04:58.862
I would feel justified in
giving the police enough evidence

04:58.898 --> 05:02.799
so that your little girlfriend

05:02.835 --> 05:05.569
could only talk to her mama

05:05.604 --> 05:10.073
every other Thursday through
a screen for the next 40 years.

05:10.109 --> 05:13.577
So, you give Maria
the money, she gives it

05:13.612 --> 05:15.078
to me...

05:15.114 --> 05:17.247
I'm out of your lives.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.249
Cash, obviously.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.366
He should have been taken to a hospital.

05:36.402 --> 05:37.568
He will be.

05:37.603 --> 05:38.869
I needed to talk to him.

05:38.904 --> 05:40.237
I can do that better here than there.

05:40.272 --> 05:41.238
Bending the rules,

05:41.273 --> 05:42.239
what a surprise.

05:42.274 --> 05:43.607
It's Jerome Valeska we're talking about.

05:43.642 --> 05:44.875
You remember what he's done.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.043
There's always a reason.

05:46.078 --> 05:48.278
He needs to go to a hospital.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.280
Lee...

05:50.316 --> 05:52.950
I know you had Falcone call off Zsasz.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.051
Thank you.

05:54.086 --> 05:55.052
You want to thank me?

05:55.087 --> 05:56.587
When you find Dwight,

05:56.622 --> 05:59.416
you have him bring back Mario
from the dead, how 'bout that?

06:04.897 --> 06:08.565
James Gordon.

06:08.601 --> 06:11.702
The James Gordon. Wow.

06:11.737 --> 06:14.571
It's actually you.

06:14.607 --> 06:16.406
So cool I'm meeting you.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.874
You should thank your friends.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.744
They're the ones who left you behind.

06:20.779 --> 06:22.245
Eh, I'd have done the same.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.414
Tell me where he took Jerome.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.883
Why? You can't stop it.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.018
Stop what?

06:28.053 --> 06:29.419
Um...

06:29.455 --> 06:30.988
the night of the awakening.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.807
You mean waking up Jerome?

06:32.946 --> 06:35.959
Jerome is just the first step.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.762
You think we're a small band.

06:38.797 --> 06:41.231
But we are everywhere.

06:50.142 --> 06:51.441

06:51.477 --> 06:53.443
I want every unit looking
for this symbol. Go, now.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.145
(cackling continues)

07:00.552 --> 07:02.552
(man humming quietly)

07:11.430 --> 07:13.497
We're almost done loading the vans.

07:13.532 --> 07:14.631
How are you doing?

07:14.667 --> 07:17.167
Ding...

07:17.202 --> 07:18.235
dong...

07:18.270 --> 07:20.871
And we are...

07:20.906 --> 07:23.407
(beeps) there.

07:29.314 --> 07:33.050
I hope you had a nice sleep.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.887
'Cause we got a busy,
busy day ahead. Hmm?

07:38.190 --> 07:40.691
(electrical buzzing)

07:40.726 --> 07:43.493
Well, hang on to your hats, folks!

08:33.432 --> 08:35.030

08:35.067 --> 08:37.567
You need to fix this situation.

08:37.602 --> 08:38.768
Who cares what people
think of the mayor?

08:38.804 --> 08:39.869
The city runs itself.

08:39.905 --> 08:41.438

08:41.472 --> 08:42.639

08:42.674 --> 08:44.474

08:44.509 --> 08:46.476
people start to smell

08:46.511 --> 08:47.711
Who?

08:47.746 --> 08:49.212
Tommy Bones.

08:49.248 --> 08:50.280
The Duke.

08:50.315 --> 08:51.982
The East Side gangs are holding,

08:52.017 --> 08:53.250
but south of the Narrows,

08:53.285 --> 08:54.451
the docks, there's chatter.

08:54.486 --> 08:56.453
The king is dead.

08:57.589 --> 08:59.256
Or soon will be. That kind of chatter.

08:59.291 --> 09:01.591
I need Ed, he's the only one...

09:01.627 --> 09:02.492
Listen to me!

09:02.527 --> 09:03.760
Ed's not here.

09:03.795 --> 09:04.928
I am.

09:04.963 --> 09:06.229
So get up, take a shower,

09:06.265 --> 09:08.431
do that disco vampire
thing with your hair.

09:08.467 --> 09:11.668
I will call a meeting of the
heads of the family, you will come,

09:11.703 --> 09:14.771
you will be your old self
and the rumors will stop.

09:14.806 --> 09:17.173
Why are you helping me?

09:17.209 --> 09:20.110
Because people think you like me, Ozzie.

09:20.145 --> 09:21.845
And as long as they're scared of you,

09:21.880 --> 09:23.813
I get to keep breathing.

09:25.217 --> 09:27.484
1:00, my place.

09:38.630 --> 09:40.797
Are you sure about this?

09:40.832 --> 09:42.232
Of course.

09:43.802 --> 09:45.368
You saved our lives.

09:46.405 --> 09:47.704
And other reasons.

09:47.739 --> 09:48.938
SELINA: This is so stupid.

09:48.974 --> 09:50.440
Cole is a weasel.

09:50.475 --> 09:51.808
Just call the cops

09:51.843 --> 09:53.376
and get his ass arrested.

09:53.412 --> 09:54.811
ALFRED: And what about your mom?

09:54.846 --> 09:56.646
I mean, a weasel he most definitely is,

09:56.682 --> 09:59.115
but if what he says is
true, she could go to jail.

09:59.151 --> 10:00.984
SELINA: And isn't that
why you have lawyers?

10:01.019 --> 10:02.485
You pay a guy like Cole,

10:02.521 --> 10:05.488
all that happens is he comes back again.

10:05.524 --> 10:06.823
And again.

10:06.858 --> 10:08.458
Look, worst case scenario,

10:08.493 --> 10:10.493
this buys us time to get
your mom's record cleared

10:10.529 --> 10:12.028
so he doesn't have a hold over her.

10:12.064 --> 10:13.563
Right, 'cause it's just money.

10:13.598 --> 10:15.665
Or another choice is I could leave.

10:17.369 --> 10:20.637
I don't want to, but...

10:20.672 --> 10:22.639
it is an option.

10:22.674 --> 10:24.140
SELINA: You know what?

10:24.176 --> 10:25.342
Fine.

10:25.377 --> 10:26.876
Fine.

10:26.912 --> 10:30.580
If he doesn't mind
paying, why not, right?

10:30.615 --> 10:33.583
But I'd start keeping
a lot of cash around.

10:43.128 --> 10:44.527
GORDON: They're all over the city.

10:44.563 --> 10:45.762
BULLOCK: Maybe they
were here the whole time

10:45.797 --> 10:47.163
and we just didn't notice.

10:47.199 --> 10:48.732
Seems most are concentrated

10:48.767 --> 10:50.533
in the Narrows, rougher parts of town.

10:50.569 --> 10:52.268
Abandoned buildings, warehouses.

10:52.304 --> 10:54.704
BULLOCK: You're thinking
this is how they communicate?

10:54.740 --> 10:57.006
Announce the next meeting
as the group moves around?

10:57.042 --> 10:59.275
Could be more than one group,
could be multiple chapters.

10:59.311 --> 11:02.712
Like the Elks, and Dwight's
the Grand Poobah or something.

11:02.748 --> 11:05.382
I'm thinking that son of a
bitch we found at the break-in

11:05.417 --> 11:07.617
could have been telling the truth.

11:07.652 --> 11:09.519
What, that they're everywhere?

11:09.554 --> 11:11.020
Huh? That Jerome's got thousands

11:11.056 --> 11:13.390
of disciples waiting for
him to wake up? Come on.

11:13.425 --> 11:15.759
- This is 50 wackadoos, tops.
- Maybe.

11:15.794 --> 11:16.893
Maybe not.

11:16.928 --> 11:18.661
I think I got something.

11:21.133 --> 11:23.933
You asked what Dwight
would need to revive Jerome.

11:23.969 --> 11:25.769
That girl, Melanie
Blake, his test subject...

11:25.804 --> 11:27.470
She received thousands
of volts of electricity.

11:27.506 --> 11:29.139
- That amount...
- GORDON: Would cause

11:29.174 --> 11:31.775
- a power surge in the electric grid.
- I was about to say

11:31.810 --> 11:33.710
that would cause a power
surge in the electric grid.

11:33.745 --> 11:35.578
Here. Ninth and Henry.

11:35.614 --> 11:37.280
The power company
recorded several surges

11:37.315 --> 11:38.982
around the time Melanie Blake
would have been brought back,

11:39.017 --> 11:40.617
and multiple surges as recent

11:40.652 --> 11:42.485
as 15 minutes ago, same location.

11:42.521 --> 11:43.787
I'll get the Strike Force.

11:43.822 --> 11:44.888
I'll get the car.

11:44.923 --> 11:47.223
I'll just...

11:47.259 --> 11:49.993
stay here, if that's okay.

11:50.028 --> 11:51.995
Yeah. That's okay.

11:52.030 --> 11:53.163
BULLOCK: Yo, Alvarez!

11:53.198 --> 11:56.199
We got a location on Dwight. Let's go.

11:58.837 --> 12:00.503
(line ringing)

12:00.539 --> 12:03.139
It's me.

12:04.943 --> 12:06.209
DWIGHT: No.

12:08.547 --> 12:09.946
It goes here.

12:09.981 --> 12:11.548
This goes here.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.986
Wake up.

12:17.022 --> 12:19.856
Come on. Wake up.

12:19.891 --> 12:22.258
GUS: I just heard from our guy in
the GCPD. They've got our location.

12:22.294 --> 12:25.762
The others are gonna wait
for us at the rendezvous.

12:25.797 --> 12:27.263
He's still dead.

12:27.299 --> 12:29.833
I know he's still dead.

12:29.868 --> 12:32.435
I ran into some technical difficulties.

12:32.471 --> 12:33.703
Nothing that I can't fix.

12:33.738 --> 12:35.038
Is everything plugged in?

12:35.073 --> 12:36.840
Yes.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.107
Try turning it on and off.

12:38.143 --> 12:39.342
I did! Three times.

12:39.377 --> 12:40.944
Look, you have spent the last year

12:40.979 --> 12:42.946
telling everyone that
the Prophet would return.

12:42.981 --> 12:45.715
People have made
sacrifices for you, Dwight.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.984
I left a really good
job at the post office.

12:48.019 --> 12:49.853
The police are coming,

12:49.888 --> 12:51.488
and you promised them Jerome.

12:51.523 --> 12:53.389
The others expect to hear him speak.

12:53.425 --> 12:55.158
They want to see his face

12:55.193 --> 12:56.593
and if you can't do that...

13:07.239 --> 13:10.807
You know, you make an interesting point.

13:10.842 --> 13:13.243
(electricity crackling)

13:15.881 --> 13:19.215
(sirens wailing nearby)

13:19.251 --> 13:22.418
They want to see your face.

13:24.289 --> 13:26.289
(sirens blaring)

13:32.063 --> 13:34.297
(electric buzzing)

13:40.038 --> 13:42.839
BULLOCK: No awakening for this guy.

13:42.874 --> 13:45.341
Looks like Dwight took off pretty quick.

13:45.377 --> 13:48.711
Yeah. Like he knew we were coming.

13:52.784 --> 13:55.118
Harvey.

13:56.388 --> 13:58.488
BULLOCK: Holy smacks. Is that Jerome?

14:02.494 --> 14:06.062
Why'd he take his face?

14:08.266 --> 14:10.533
(crowd clamoring)

14:10.569 --> 14:13.136
(heavy door opens, closes)

14:13.171 --> 14:16.773
DWIGHT: Brothers and sisters,

14:16.808 --> 14:22.412
I promised you Jerome
would return and today

14:22.447 --> 14:25.882
your faith is rewarded.

14:25.917 --> 14:30.053
Jerome is here.

14:30.088 --> 14:32.021
(cheering)

14:34.359 --> 14:38.361
Behold the Prophet.

14:42.367 --> 14:44.334
(breathing unsteadily)

14:46.304 --> 14:51.107
The Prophet is here.

14:51.142 --> 14:52.976
Where's Jerome?

14:53.011 --> 14:54.444
WOMAN: Where's the hell's Jerome?

14:54.479 --> 14:56.279
The Prophet is here.

14:56.314 --> 14:57.580
(crowd muttering) Where's Jerome?

14:57.616 --> 15:00.016
The Prophet is here!

15:00.051 --> 15:02.085
(shouting)

15:02.120 --> 15:04.454
Listen to me!

15:04.489 --> 15:08.157
Jerome is here.

15:08.193 --> 15:09.592
He never left us.

15:09.628 --> 15:12.595
Each of you kept him alive.

15:12.631 --> 15:15.365
Each of you is Jerome.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.267
I am Jerome.

15:18.303 --> 15:20.937
We are all...

15:20.972 --> 15:24.340
Jerome.

15:24.376 --> 15:26.109
WOMAN: I'm Jerome.

15:26.144 --> 15:27.977
MAN: I'm Jerome.

15:28.013 --> 15:29.212
- I'm Jerome.
- I'm Jerome.

15:29.247 --> 15:31.347
You are Jerome.

15:31.383 --> 15:33.016
You are Jerome. You are Jerome.

15:33.051 --> 15:34.550
And you, and you...

15:34.586 --> 15:36.686
(shouting)

15:36.721 --> 15:38.154
(chanting): We are Jerome.

15:38.189 --> 15:41.190
We are Jerome!

15:41.226 --> 15:42.892
We are Jerome!

15:42.927 --> 15:44.394
(cackling) We are Jerome!

15:44.429 --> 15:46.996
We are Jerome! We are Jerome!

15:47.032 --> 15:49.198
We are Jerome!

15:51.169 --> 15:53.069
Great. Thank you.

16:15.569 --> 16:18.181
I was going through the evidence
you recovered from the scene.

16:18.272 --> 16:20.372
That phone was on the
corpse next to Jerome.

16:20.407 --> 16:22.234
The last number came from the precinct.

16:22.309 --> 16:25.944
Wait. You're saying someone
in this house tipped them off?

16:25.980 --> 16:29.081
It would make sense. They cleared
out moments before we got there.

16:29.116 --> 16:30.849
So we got a freaking mole?

16:32.219 --> 16:34.386
I was gonna replace that lamp.

16:34.421 --> 16:36.588
Is there any way to know who called?

16:36.624 --> 16:38.257
The number came up as the main.

16:38.292 --> 16:39.892
So you can't make some kind of gadget

16:39.927 --> 16:41.126
to figure it out?

16:41.162 --> 16:43.095
Sure. I'll get on that.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.163
Let me see it.

16:46.567 --> 16:49.268
GORDON: Everybody listen up!

16:49.303 --> 16:51.637
Everyone stop what you're doing.

16:54.041 --> 16:56.942
We have a mole.

16:56.977 --> 17:00.078
The cult we've been tracking
was tipped off to our raid,

17:00.114 --> 17:02.514
and the call came from in here.

17:02.550 --> 17:05.617
It was sent to this phone.

17:06.787 --> 17:09.454
So...

17:09.490 --> 17:11.455
let's find out who the traitor is,

17:11.492 --> 17:14.292
shall we?

17:14.328 --> 17:16.060
(keypad beeping)

17:19.532 --> 17:20.499
GORDON: Grab him! (excited chatter)

17:20.534 --> 17:22.099
- Get him!
- Stop!

17:22.136 --> 17:23.101
(grunts)

17:23.137 --> 17:24.403
OFFICER: No, no, don't.

17:24.438 --> 17:26.939
Get him in the room.

17:26.973 --> 17:28.406
Get him in the interrogation room.

17:28.442 --> 17:30.509
Good bluff.

17:30.544 --> 17:32.811
Thank you, sir.

17:32.846 --> 17:34.413
BULLOCK: Everybody get back to work.

17:38.819 --> 17:40.385
BARBARA: My, my.

17:40.421 --> 17:42.654
You scrub up nice.

17:42.690 --> 17:44.189
Am I early?

17:44.225 --> 17:45.724
About that...

17:45.759 --> 17:47.192
I sent out the word.

17:47.228 --> 17:49.394
Said you wanted to see
everyone, express summons,

17:49.430 --> 17:50.629
et cetera, et cetera.

17:50.664 --> 17:52.397
And...

17:52.433 --> 17:54.366
See for yourself.

17:54.401 --> 17:55.968
This is a rebellion.

17:56.003 --> 17:57.569
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

17:57.605 --> 17:59.972
But... I did warn ya.

18:00.007 --> 18:03.342
You have been such a friend, Barbara.

18:03.377 --> 18:04.810
Tell me.

18:04.845 --> 18:07.145
What should I do now?

18:07.181 --> 18:11.750
Well. If it were me, I
would pick one of them,

18:11.785 --> 18:14.019
the Duke, maybe, or Tommy Bones,

18:14.054 --> 18:15.420
and teach them a lesson.

18:15.456 --> 18:17.856
They don't respect you, Oswald.

18:17.891 --> 18:20.926
In fact, you probably want to
kill Tommy Bones and the Duke.

18:20.961 --> 18:22.594
Just clean house.

18:22.630 --> 18:25.297
(laughs)

18:25.332 --> 18:27.499
I'm sorry. Just... (laughs)

18:27.534 --> 18:29.901
(stifled laughing)

18:29.937 --> 18:32.371
Well. I'm glad you can
find the humor in it.

18:32.406 --> 18:34.373
Did you really think

18:34.408 --> 18:37.242
I would be so easy to manipulate?

18:41.482 --> 18:43.081
What was your plan?

18:43.117 --> 18:44.349
Take advantage of me

18:44.385 --> 18:46.351
while I was in a weakened state?

18:46.387 --> 18:48.587
Trick me into attacking my subordinates

18:48.622 --> 18:50.289
so they truly did rebel?

18:50.324 --> 18:52.124
Inciting war,

18:52.159 --> 18:54.393
so that you could pick up the pieces?

18:54.428 --> 18:56.295
(laughing)

18:56.330 --> 18:59.965
My dear, you are tragically

19:00.000 --> 19:01.967
out of your depth.

19:02.002 --> 19:04.569
Oswald. I am your friend.

19:04.605 --> 19:06.772
Perhaps I should call
Tommy Bones. Or the Duke.

19:06.807 --> 19:09.041
Or any of the families,
and ask them if you

19:09.076 --> 19:10.876
really invited them to this meeting.

19:10.911 --> 19:12.878
What would they say?

19:12.913 --> 19:14.980
(phone ringing)

19:17.685 --> 19:20.285
Yes?

19:20.321 --> 19:21.987
He's right here.

19:23.257 --> 19:25.023
Tommy Bones.

19:28.195 --> 19:29.227
Yes?

19:29.263 --> 19:31.797
You get the message?

19:31.832 --> 19:33.932
We don't work for you no more.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.435
Your day is done, freak.

19:36.470 --> 19:39.071
How dare you?

19:39.106 --> 19:40.806
I will gut you!

19:40.841 --> 19:43.275
I will hang your entrails

19:43.310 --> 19:45.610
from every lamppost in Gotham!

19:45.646 --> 19:47.245
Then Nygma dies.

19:47.281 --> 19:49.081
What?

19:49.116 --> 19:52.751
Walk away quiet. Maybe we'll
send him back in one piece.

19:52.786 --> 19:54.786
We'll even let you keep being mayor.

19:54.822 --> 19:58.190
(phone clicks, beeps)

19:58.225 --> 19:59.424
They have Ed.

19:59.460 --> 20:02.527
They're holding him hostage.

20:02.563 --> 20:05.130
I will kill them.

20:05.165 --> 20:06.365
Every one of them!

20:06.400 --> 20:08.300
(panting)

20:08.335 --> 20:09.601
I have to go.

20:09.636 --> 20:11.036
I have to gather my men.

20:11.071 --> 20:13.405
(Penguin muttering indistinctly)

20:19.179 --> 20:20.278
(phone rings, beeps)

20:20.314 --> 20:22.681
Put her on.

20:27.521 --> 20:29.721
- Hey.
- He bought it.

20:33.394 --> 20:34.393
Well done.

20:34.428 --> 20:35.494
So we're good, now?

20:35.529 --> 20:38.063
I said all you told me.

20:38.098 --> 20:40.198
Yeah. We're good.

20:41.368 --> 20:44.202
(gunshot, body thuds)

20:44.238 --> 20:47.906
BULLOCK: Officer Andrew
Dove, six years with the GCPD,

20:47.941 --> 20:50.909
twice decorated.

20:50.944 --> 20:53.745
Up for promotion in six months.

20:53.781 --> 20:55.547
Well, congrats, pal,

20:55.582 --> 20:59.317
'cause you're going to Blackgate,
and they love cops there.

20:59.353 --> 21:01.586
I stopped being a cop a long time ago.

21:01.622 --> 21:03.655
The hell you did.

21:03.690 --> 21:05.690
No one ever stops being a cop.

21:05.726 --> 21:07.259
You were here

21:07.294 --> 21:09.161
when Jerome and the Maniax attacked.

21:09.196 --> 21:11.696
You defended this house against him.

21:11.732 --> 21:14.399
And that's the night I changed.

21:14.435 --> 21:16.668
BULLOCK: Don't waste your breath, Jim.

21:16.703 --> 21:18.236
Let's put him on a bus to Blackgate,

21:18.272 --> 21:19.571
stick a target on his back

21:19.606 --> 21:21.072
and forget about him!

21:21.108 --> 21:22.707
(chuckles): Good cop, bad cop

21:22.743 --> 21:24.376
doesn't work on cops.

21:24.411 --> 21:27.612
At the very least, you two
should have switched roles.

21:28.982 --> 21:30.749
You know what?

21:33.220 --> 21:34.219
You're right.

21:36.490 --> 21:38.190
You're gonna tell me
what Dwight's planning

21:38.225 --> 21:39.524
right now!

21:39.560 --> 21:41.092
(wheezing laugh)

21:42.996 --> 21:44.596
(maniacal laughter) You think
this is funny, don't you?

21:44.631 --> 21:46.264
How about this?!

21:47.568 --> 21:50.435
(chuckling weakly): Hilarious.

21:50.471 --> 21:51.636
Again!

21:51.672 --> 21:53.772
(maniacal laughter) If you insist!

21:58.612 --> 22:00.745
Harvey. Harvey, no! No.

22:05.052 --> 22:07.085
25 milligrams of sodium pentothal.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.255
Give him a few minutes, he'll
tell you what you need to know.

22:10.290 --> 22:12.090
Damn.

22:14.361 --> 22:15.427
Lee...

22:17.097 --> 22:19.197
- Lee, stop.
- Don't touch me.

22:20.334 --> 22:21.600
What the hell was that?

22:21.635 --> 22:23.235
You wanted Dove to
talk, so now he'll talk.

22:23.270 --> 22:24.636
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Really?

22:24.672 --> 22:26.905
Did I not just see Harvey
punch him in the face?

22:26.940 --> 22:28.273
What about you? You
brought a wounded suspect

22:28.309 --> 22:29.474
into the precinct

22:29.510 --> 22:30.876
instead of taking him to the hospital,

22:30.911 --> 22:32.377
because you wanted to interrogate him.

22:32.413 --> 22:34.046
You guys can bend the
rules, but I can't.

22:34.081 --> 22:37.215
None of us should... Me, Harvey, you.

22:37.251 --> 22:39.418
But especially not you.
You're better than that.

22:39.453 --> 22:40.419
Oh, that's so sweet.

22:40.454 --> 22:41.787
Would you stop it?

22:41.822 --> 22:43.989
Look, you want to blame me

22:44.024 --> 22:45.557
for Mario's death, that's fine.

22:45.592 --> 22:48.794
I can live with that,
knowing you're okay.

22:48.829 --> 22:50.329
But don't let your hatred of me

22:50.364 --> 22:52.331
turn you into something you're not.

22:52.366 --> 22:54.066
Or what, Jim?

22:54.101 --> 22:56.501
If I change too much,
you're gonna put two

22:56.537 --> 22:58.337
in my heart, like you did to Mario?

23:00.941 --> 23:03.175
I'll talk to Harvey.

23:03.210 --> 23:04.843
You came back to the job too soon.

23:04.878 --> 23:05.944
You need some time off.

23:05.979 --> 23:07.579
Yeah, you do that.

23:07.614 --> 23:09.581
And I'll tell the commissioner
how I saw the acting captain

23:09.616 --> 23:11.350
punch a suspect in the face.

23:11.385 --> 23:15.954
Don't ever touch me again
or tell me what to do.

23:18.392 --> 23:20.926
Jim, hey, it worked.

23:20.961 --> 23:22.027
Dove gave it up.

23:22.062 --> 23:23.328
Dwight's heading to Channel 9

23:23.364 --> 23:25.030
to make some sort of announcement

23:25.065 --> 23:26.298
on the 6:00 news.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.333
All right, call the station.

23:28.369 --> 23:30.913
- Have them evacuate...
- I'm already on it. Let's go!

23:33.507 --> 23:36.475
The GCPD has asked us
to evacuate the building.

23:36.510 --> 23:40.278
They assure me that
everything is under control.

23:40.314 --> 23:41.780
(employees screaming)

23:41.815 --> 23:43.782
No one's going anywhere.

23:43.817 --> 23:45.550
(alarmed cries)

23:51.258 --> 23:53.892
We've got a show to do, people.

23:53.927 --> 23:56.728
And, as you know, the show

23:56.764 --> 23:59.865
must go on.

24:02.503 --> 24:05.370
(maniacal laughter)

24:07.174 --> 24:08.774
(exhales in frustration)

24:11.412 --> 24:13.712
What the...

24:13.747 --> 24:14.880
(muffled cry)

24:14.915 --> 24:16.615
Boo. Ha, ha, ha...

24:22.978 --> 24:24.911
Wow. Well, that is quite a story.

24:24.947 --> 24:27.114
You know, I know I've been dead,

24:27.149 --> 24:29.649
but doesn't that seem
kind of crazy to you?

24:29.685 --> 24:31.351
Hey, maybe you're dreaming.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.853
Try shooting yourself.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.789
Huh. Oh...

24:36.792 --> 24:38.191
Nah. Hey,

24:38.227 --> 24:39.760
tell me more about this cult.

24:39.795 --> 24:41.361
They think I'm pretty great, huh?

24:41.396 --> 24:44.164
They're a bunch of raving
lunatics and idiots.

24:44.199 --> 24:45.532
<i>Lunatics and idiots?</i>

24:45.567 --> 24:47.067
Ooh, my kind of people.

24:47.102 --> 24:48.702
(gagging)

24:48.737 --> 24:51.705
Sorry. (groans)

24:51.740 --> 24:52.873
Head's still a little fuzzy.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.542
You know, I was just reborn.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.944
Last year was nothing but darkness...

24:59.248 --> 25:01.748
as far as the eye can see.

25:03.452 --> 25:05.085
I know you, right?

25:05.120 --> 25:06.887
- Yep.
- Hey,

25:06.922 --> 25:10.624
did you and I ever, uh...

25:10.659 --> 25:12.926
(clicks tongue) Oh, God, no.

25:12.961 --> 25:15.195
Why? Gingers not your type?

25:15.230 --> 25:16.696
Oh, I remember.

25:16.732 --> 25:20.634
You're Jim Gordon's little... Twinkie.

25:20.669 --> 25:21.902
Easy.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.937
How's it going between you and Jimbo?

25:23.972 --> 25:27.474
Huh? You still together, or...

25:27.509 --> 25:28.942
- No.
- No?

25:28.977 --> 25:32.512
Oh, that's a shame.

25:32.548 --> 25:34.781
I really liked you guys.

25:34.817 --> 25:36.950
What happened?

25:38.487 --> 25:41.121
He killed my husband
on our wedding night.

25:42.891 --> 25:44.624
(chuckling)

25:44.660 --> 25:46.526
Glad you find it funny.

25:46.562 --> 25:47.527
I do.

25:47.563 --> 25:49.596
(laughing)

25:49.631 --> 25:51.598
I get why you don't.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.767
(laughing)

25:53.802 --> 25:55.702
Wow.

25:55.737 --> 25:58.939
You miss a lot being dead.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.508
You know what? Go ahead, enjoy it.

26:01.543 --> 26:02.876
There's about a hundred cops

26:02.911 --> 26:04.077
on the other side of that door

26:04.112 --> 26:05.478
ready to kill you all over again.

26:05.514 --> 26:06.479
(chuckles)

26:06.515 --> 26:08.815
I see your point.

26:08.851 --> 26:10.217
It's a business.

26:10.252 --> 26:13.320
So, when I was last, you know,

26:13.355 --> 26:15.622
uh, alive,

26:15.657 --> 26:17.824
I was about to kill Bruce Wayne.

26:17.860 --> 26:20.160
I suppose I didn't manage to...

26:20.195 --> 26:22.195
No. Right.

26:22.231 --> 26:25.966
Theo Galavan killed me,
that jug-eared Judas.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.001
Well, I suppose I should
start by killing him.

26:28.036 --> 26:29.369
Theo Galavan's dead.

26:29.404 --> 26:32.038
Oh... Who beat me to it?

26:32.074 --> 26:34.407
W-Which time?

26:34.443 --> 26:37.477
Galavan came back to life, too?

26:37.512 --> 26:40.046
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm?

26:40.082 --> 26:43.316
That son of a bitch
is always upstaging me.

26:43.352 --> 26:47.754
Well, I guess I'm just
missing one thing, then.

26:49.391 --> 26:51.424
Where is my face?

26:52.928 --> 26:54.928
(sirens blaring)

26:58.634 --> 27:00.200
(tires screeching)

27:04.606 --> 27:06.239
Something's not right.

27:06.275 --> 27:09.242
(indistinct chatter)

27:09.278 --> 27:11.511
Whoa! Hold your position.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.580
Whoa! Hold!

27:19.888 --> 27:21.254
Son of a bitch!

27:22.557 --> 27:23.690
FEMALE REPORTER: I'm on the scene now

27:23.725 --> 27:25.091
and we're reporting live. (door opens)

27:25.127 --> 27:26.192
The Channel 9 news station

27:26.228 --> 27:28.628
seems to have had a hostage situation.

27:28.664 --> 27:31.231
Uh, we're not sure how many hostages...

27:38.674 --> 27:40.373
It's all here?

27:40.409 --> 27:42.442
200 grand.

27:43.460 --> 27:44.945
We did it, baby.

27:44.980 --> 27:46.780
Come on, let's just
get out of this town.

27:46.815 --> 27:49.082
Hey, smile.

27:50.652 --> 27:51.851
We won.

27:51.887 --> 27:55.455
Yeah, smile. You won.

27:55.490 --> 27:57.023
(sighs)

27:57.059 --> 27:58.792
You're rich.

27:58.827 --> 27:59.859
Go away, kid.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.761
Shut up, Cole.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.597
You caught me.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.568
What do you want me to say?

28:08.603 --> 28:10.570
I just want to make sure I got it right.

28:10.605 --> 28:13.173
You find out Bruce Wayne

28:13.208 --> 28:15.542
and your abandoned daughter are a thing.

28:15.577 --> 28:16.710
You figure,

28:16.745 --> 28:18.144
"There's an easy mark."

28:18.180 --> 28:20.280
You come back, make nice,

28:20.315 --> 28:22.515
do the whole mother/daughter
bonding thing,

28:22.551 --> 28:25.318
and then pull this scam.

28:25.762 --> 28:28.388
- That about it?
- Pretty much.

28:30.559 --> 28:32.525
You want to hate me,

28:32.561 --> 28:33.693
that's your choice.

28:33.729 --> 28:36.096
- You're damn right.
- Why so angry?

28:36.131 --> 28:37.864
It's not like your boyfriend
cares about the money.

28:37.899 --> 28:39.276
I know he doesn't care about the money.

28:39.311 --> 28:40.600
I don't care about the money.

28:40.635 --> 28:43.737
I care that my mother,

28:43.772 --> 28:46.506
who left me when I was a kid,

28:46.541 --> 28:48.208
only came back to use me!

28:48.243 --> 28:49.676
Easy.

28:49.711 --> 28:51.378
Selina!

28:51.413 --> 28:54.481
Please, don't.

28:56.184 --> 28:58.852
Don't ever...

28:58.887 --> 29:02.055
come back.

29:06.361 --> 29:07.660
(stage lamp explodes)

29:07.696 --> 29:09.129
(wild laughter)

29:09.164 --> 29:12.866
The time has come to reveal ourselves.

29:12.901 --> 29:15.635
Gotham will remember...

29:15.670 --> 29:19.205
No. History will remember.

29:19.241 --> 29:21.741
Dwight?

29:21.777 --> 29:22.876
Dwight?

29:23.574 --> 29:25.578
The police are outside.

29:26.214 --> 29:29.649
Detective Gordon is on the phone.

29:29.684 --> 29:32.752
It's just like when he called Jerome
outside the Children's Hospital benefit.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.892
Hello, Jimbo.

29:38.927 --> 29:41.227
Shut up, Dwight. We have
the building surrounded.

29:41.263 --> 29:43.763
There's no way out. Let the hostages go.

29:43.799 --> 29:46.433
You're outside?

29:46.468 --> 29:48.601
You are, aren't you?

29:48.637 --> 29:49.836
Goody!

29:49.871 --> 29:52.739
(laughter)

29:52.774 --> 29:53.740
GORDON: The cult will
never follow you, Dwight.

29:53.775 --> 29:56.609
I saw you, at the theater?

29:56.645 --> 29:58.011
You don't have what it takes.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.747
(inhales) Breathe, James.

30:00.782 --> 30:03.049
I haven't touched a hair on
your pretty girlfriend's head.

30:03.085 --> 30:06.419
(laughter)

30:06.455 --> 30:10.056
You're just repeating what
Jerome said to me last year.

30:10.092 --> 30:11.858
I am Jerome.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.193
GORDON: No, no.

30:13.228 --> 30:14.194
You're the understudy

30:14.229 --> 30:16.229
pretending to be the star.

30:16.264 --> 30:17.397
You're a fraud.

30:17.432 --> 30:19.399
No, I am Jerome!

30:19.434 --> 30:21.201
I am Jerome.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.570
And soon Gotham will know it.

30:23.605 --> 30:25.038
GORDON: Well, for the record.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.739
You're doing one thing Jerome never did.

30:26.775 --> 30:28.908
Boring me.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.645
So the back entrance is a no-go,

30:32.681 --> 30:33.880
but we think we might have found a way

30:33.915 --> 30:35.482
through the ventilation system.

30:35.517 --> 30:38.384
All right, let's go.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.986
Dwight's going live any minute.

30:41.823 --> 30:43.623
The Penguin killed the Duke and his crew

30:43.658 --> 30:45.592
because he thinks they kidnapped Nygma.

30:45.627 --> 30:48.728
Meanwhile, they're still
looking for Tommy Bones.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.097
Hmm. Who they won't find,
since you already killed him.

30:51.133 --> 30:53.633
And now these nimrods are
terrified for their life.

30:53.668 --> 30:56.803
Which is why they're here
with their guard down. Hmm.

30:56.838 --> 30:58.972
You gotta hand it to Nygma.

30:59.007 --> 31:01.174
He knew how to get Penguin
to turn on the five families.

31:01.209 --> 31:04.677
Poor Ozzie is tearing
apart everything he built.

31:04.713 --> 31:06.913
Remember, when this is
over, and we're in charge,

31:06.948 --> 31:08.915
Nygma dies.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.950
You made a promise.

31:14.689 --> 31:16.589
Sealed with a kiss, baby.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.691
Now, what about them?

31:18.727 --> 31:21.294
We've got option "A,"
appeal to their reason...

31:21.329 --> 31:23.930
Convince them we alone can
protect them from Penguin.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.466
Seems unlikely. They are men. Hmm.

31:26.501 --> 31:28.234
You just like option "B."

31:28.270 --> 31:29.802
Mm.

31:29.838 --> 31:31.738
Fine, option "B."

31:32.908 --> 31:37.277
(Schubert's "Ave Maria"
playing) ♪ Ave ♪

31:37.312 --> 31:38.778
MAN: All right, we worked it out.

31:38.813 --> 31:39.812
What the...

31:39.848 --> 31:41.714
Ed, honey, everything's set.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.283
Penguin's all yours.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.185
(men crying out)

31:45.220 --> 31:47.654
Yeah, yeah, option "B".

31:47.689 --> 31:50.123
(bullet casing tinkling on the floor)

31:50.158 --> 31:52.158
(chuckles)

31:52.194 --> 31:55.962
Four... three... two... one...

31:55.997 --> 31:58.898
(distorted): Brothers and sisters,

31:58.934 --> 32:01.834
my name is Dwi...

32:01.870 --> 32:04.504
(clearing throat)

32:04.539 --> 32:06.039
My name is...

32:06.074 --> 32:09.842
Jerome.

32:11.713 --> 32:15.848
History will call
tonight the night of...

32:15.884 --> 32:17.350
Look at that.

32:17.385 --> 32:20.753
No charisma, no stage presence.

32:20.789 --> 32:23.056
The time has come to reveal ourselves.

32:23.091 --> 32:25.892
Though he is a handsome
fellow, huh? (chuckles)

32:25.927 --> 32:28.761
Hey, Doc, keep watching.

32:28.797 --> 32:31.564
You don't want to
miss what happens next.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.882
Today, Gotham will remember.

32:45.851 --> 32:47.384
(man screams)

32:47.419 --> 32:50.187
Oh, sorry! Didn't see you.

32:50.222 --> 32:52.522
(cackles, siren whoops,
man continues screaming)

32:56.328 --> 32:59.963
OFFICER (over megaphone):
Put your weapons down.

32:59.998 --> 33:01.965
We want to talk to Jerome.

33:04.170 --> 33:05.803
We want to talk to Dwight.

33:05.838 --> 33:08.172
We won't hurt you.

33:08.207 --> 33:11.742
We just want to talk to you, Dwight.

33:21.487 --> 33:25.255
The Prophet told us
that we're all prisoners,

33:25.291 --> 33:28.659
slaves to a city that doesn't love us,

33:28.694 --> 33:31.495
but tonight...

33:31.530 --> 33:35.099
tonight we rise up.

33:35.134 --> 33:38.168
We are all Jerome.

33:38.204 --> 33:40.671
Each of you... (cackling)

33:40.706 --> 33:43.040
is Jerome. That's the truth.

33:43.075 --> 33:44.341
GORDON: Stop.

33:45.377 --> 33:48.979
All of us are Jerome.

33:49.014 --> 33:51.115
We are all... (door bangs open)

33:52.118 --> 33:53.684
GORDON: Drop it!

33:53.719 --> 33:56.420
BULLOCK: Cut the feed!

33:56.455 --> 33:58.155
(people screaming)

33:58.190 --> 34:00.390
Keep them up where I can see them.

34:00.426 --> 34:01.892
GORDON: Dwight, stop!

34:05.131 --> 34:06.396
- Just keep moving.
- All right, man, all right.

34:06.432 --> 34:08.232
DWIGHT: Don't make... (grunts)

34:08.266 --> 34:09.867
You can't do this. This is
the night of the awakening.

34:09.902 --> 34:11.435
This is the night of the awakening.

34:11.469 --> 34:13.804
Not anymore.

34:22.348 --> 34:24.481
Did you know?

34:25.918 --> 34:28.351
That she was only after the money.

34:28.387 --> 34:29.553
I-I wasn't sure.

34:29.588 --> 34:31.054
Did you know?!

34:31.090 --> 34:33.456
Yes.

34:33.492 --> 34:34.610
It was obvious.

34:34.661 --> 34:37.261
And you gave her the money anyway?

34:37.297 --> 34:38.562
The money wasn't important.

34:38.598 --> 34:39.597
She was lying!

34:39.632 --> 34:40.898
What were my options, Selina?

34:40.933 --> 34:43.367
If I didn't give her the money,
she would've skipped town.

34:43.402 --> 34:45.902
So, you thought you'd pay her.

34:45.938 --> 34:48.938
Have her stick around, maybe
get used to being my mom.

34:48.975 --> 34:50.107
Is that it?

34:50.915 --> 34:52.443
Yes.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.212
- You lied to me.
- I didn't tell you the truth.

34:55.248 --> 34:57.214
- It's the same thing.
- Perhaps, but telling you

34:57.250 --> 34:59.116
your mother was a con artist
who'd only sought you out

34:59.152 --> 35:02.053
for the purposes of
getting money from me...

35:02.088 --> 35:04.455
didn't seem like a very
attractive alternative.

35:04.490 --> 35:08.659
You... and her...

35:08.695 --> 35:11.162
you both lied to me.

35:11.197 --> 35:13.264
But for very different reasons.

35:14.300 --> 35:14.965
(grunts)

35:20.839 --> 35:22.339
Fight me!

35:22.874 --> 35:24.541
Hit me!

35:24.576 --> 35:26.209
Fight me!

35:27.179 --> 35:29.579
Fight me!

35:29.615 --> 35:30.847
No.

35:34.186 --> 35:39.222
You know... the only reason
she came back to Gotham,

35:39.258 --> 35:42.559
the only reason she tracked me down

35:42.594 --> 35:47.163
after 11 years...

35:47.199 --> 35:49.199
was you.

35:59.177 --> 36:00.510
WOMAN: We love you!

36:00.545 --> 36:02.345
We love you!

36:02.381 --> 36:05.382
WOMAN 2: We love you, Dwight!

36:05.417 --> 36:07.217
(shouts of support continue)

36:07.252 --> 36:09.386
I want Dwight taken
back for questioning.

36:09.421 --> 36:11.354
So much for the big awakening, huh?

36:11.390 --> 36:13.923
Yeah, still, we should get
some cars out on the street.

36:13.959 --> 36:15.892
Dwight got his message out.

36:15.927 --> 36:18.128
A few lunatics could still respond.

36:18.163 --> 36:21.031
(phone buzzing)

36:21.066 --> 36:22.232
Lee? What is...

36:22.267 --> 36:23.233
THOMPKINS: Jim.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.367
I don't know how,

36:24.403 --> 36:26.436
but Jerome is alive,

36:26.471 --> 36:28.071
and I think he's coming after Dwight.

36:29.875 --> 36:31.641
Where's Dwight?

36:31.677 --> 36:33.410
I saw a uni walking him that way. Why?

36:39.351 --> 36:42.719
JEROME: Hang on, Dwight.
We got a busy night ahead.

36:42.754 --> 36:44.821
What's that? (cackles)

36:44.856 --> 36:46.823
This guy's hilarious.

36:46.858 --> 36:47.891
(cackles)

36:53.564 --> 36:55.630
(grunting)

37:04.708 --> 37:06.708
(grunts, chuckles)

37:08.679 --> 37:11.179
So... how's it look?

37:11.215 --> 37:13.048
It's good. It looks good.

37:17.487 --> 37:21.623
You wouldn't lie to me, right, Dwight?

37:21.658 --> 37:23.425
No.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.594
It looks good.

37:25.629 --> 37:27.863
It's good.

37:31.468 --> 37:35.270
Say... you're not mad, are you?

37:35.305 --> 37:37.839
Mad?

37:39.309 --> 37:44.045
What could I possibly be mad about? Huh?

37:44.081 --> 37:46.548
You know, the whole
cutting off your face.

37:46.583 --> 37:49.551
Oh, buddy...

37:49.586 --> 37:52.320
you brought me back from the dead.

37:52.356 --> 37:56.024
What's a cutoff face between friends?

37:56.695 --> 37:58.528
I guess that's true.

37:58.563 --> 38:00.562
You guessed right. Bingo.

38:00.597 --> 38:02.397
(hums "Thunder and Blazes")

38:02.432 --> 38:04.666
What are, what are we doing? Ooh.

38:04.701 --> 38:06.401
(chuckles)

38:06.436 --> 38:08.336
You'll see.

38:08.372 --> 38:11.139
(whistling "Thunder and Blazes")

38:13.210 --> 38:16.611
Nothing? He is out
there! Someone has him!

38:16.647 --> 38:19.214
Sorry, boss. Mr. Nygma wasn't at any

38:19.249 --> 38:21.249
of Tommy Bones's or the Duke's hideouts.

38:21.285 --> 38:23.718
Santino. Hit Santino.

38:23.754 --> 38:25.720
He was close with Tommy Bones.

38:25.756 --> 38:27.722
I-I bet they are in this together.

38:27.758 --> 38:29.190
GABE: Boss, got to tell you,

38:29.226 --> 38:30.492
I'm hearing some weird things.

38:30.527 --> 38:31.526
Ed is in danger.

38:31.561 --> 38:32.661
I will tear this city apart

38:32.696 --> 38:34.462
brick by brick!

38:34.498 --> 38:36.197
(phone rings)

38:36.233 --> 38:37.666
<i>What?</i>

38:37.701 --> 38:39.034
NYGMA: Oswald.

38:39.069 --> 38:41.569
Ed, is that really
you? Are-Are you okay?

38:41.605 --> 38:43.571
I... I can't talk long.

38:43.607 --> 38:45.206
I snuck away to the phone.

38:45.242 --> 38:47.842
Ed, who has you? Where are you?

38:47.878 --> 38:49.577
Kane Chemicals.

38:49.613 --> 38:51.446
Hurry. Oswald, hurry, please.

38:51.481 --> 38:53.882
(dial tone hums) Ed? Ed?

38:53.917 --> 38:55.016
Ed?

38:55.052 --> 38:56.885
Uh, uh, c-come on.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.354
Now. No, Gabe. Not you.

38:59.389 --> 39:00.956
You stay by the phone
in case he calls back.

39:00.991 --> 39:03.458
Kane Chemicals, let's go. Move!

39:04.494 --> 39:05.860
Nothing on the news van,

39:05.896 --> 39:06.928
but reports are coming in.

39:06.964 --> 39:08.530
Random attacks,

39:08.565 --> 39:11.900
looting... at least six
fires in the past hour.

39:11.935 --> 39:12.968
You're telling me that ding-dong Dwight

39:13.003 --> 39:14.402
actually got people to go ape?

39:14.438 --> 39:16.338
You need to see this.

39:17.407 --> 39:18.873
REPORTER: As has been reported,

39:18.909 --> 39:20.108
Channel 9's van

39:20.143 --> 39:22.110
was stolen this evening.

39:22.145 --> 39:24.112
We are now getting video from the thief,

39:24.147 --> 39:28.149
which we will play in hopes
it leads to his apprehension.

39:28.185 --> 39:29.818
JEROME: Testing. Testing.

39:29.853 --> 39:31.252
BULLOCK: Campos, call Channel 9!

39:31.288 --> 39:33.455
Tell them to stop broadcasting this now!

39:33.490 --> 39:35.824
JEROME: Am I live?

39:35.859 --> 39:37.258
Am I on air?

39:37.294 --> 39:38.994
Can you hear me? Ah, screw it.

39:39.029 --> 39:41.896
Let's do it.

39:41.932 --> 39:43.465
Hi.

39:44.501 --> 39:47.068
Some of you may know, I died.

39:47.104 --> 39:48.470
Uh-oh.

39:50.207 --> 39:54.275
But take it from me, death is...

39:54.311 --> 39:57.579
dull...

39:57.614 --> 39:59.981
but coming back...

40:00.017 --> 40:02.951
that is something.

40:02.986 --> 40:07.622
Leave it to dying to give you
a whole new perspective on life.

40:09.226 --> 40:13.228
And I would like to share that with you.

40:13.263 --> 40:15.463
Uh, Officer, you look terrible.

40:15.499 --> 40:17.032
Hey, you got... oh.

40:18.068 --> 40:19.834
Tonight, Gotham,

40:19.870 --> 40:23.004
in the darkness, there are no rules.

40:23.040 --> 40:26.274
So, tonight, Gotham...

40:26.309 --> 40:28.009
do what you want.

40:28.045 --> 40:32.213
Kill who you want. Hmm?

40:33.984 --> 40:37.185
And when morning comes...

40:37.220 --> 40:41.723
you, too, shall be...

40:41.758 --> 40:43.625
reborn.

40:43.660 --> 40:46.161
(cackles)

40:46.196 --> 40:48.863
Oh, and, uh... Dwight.

40:48.899 --> 40:52.467
I don't forgive you for my face.

40:52.502 --> 40:55.103
(cackling)

40:59.376 --> 41:00.542
He's at the power
plant across the river.

41:00.577 --> 41:01.843
BULLOCK: You'll never make it in time.

41:01.878 --> 41:05.018
Go to the roof. Let me call a chopper.

41:05.053 --> 41:07.281
We need a bird to go now.
