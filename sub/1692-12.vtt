WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:01.400
He loves me.

00:01.918 --> 00:02.937
<i>Senator Harding?</i>

00:03.073 --> 00:07.074
But America needs him
and so I have to sacrifice.

00:07.109 --> 00:09.609
In three weeks Paddy Ryan
is taking over

00:09.643 --> 00:11.143
as chief clerk
of the fourth ward.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.111
Jimmy here'll be
Pat's man Friday.

00:13.145 --> 00:16.012
- What's your name, handsome?
- Nelson.

00:17.981 --> 00:19.515
You were 13 years old.

00:19.549 --> 00:21.883
I was one of
King Neptune's consorts.

00:21.917 --> 00:25.317
Your father saw me and
Nucky brought me to him.

00:25.352 --> 00:27.118
I'm dying, boy.
Where are you going?

00:27.152 --> 00:29.286
I'm not quite sure what
you're getting at, sweetie.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.621
This morning I found
this in his house

00:31.655 --> 00:34.324
hidden in the kitchen.

00:34.358 --> 00:37.126
- Half the team is indicted.
- What do you propose?

00:37.160 --> 00:40.230
Come here to Chicago.
I want you to think hard

00:40.264 --> 00:43.032
about who in this town
is willing to do you a favor.

00:44.401 --> 00:46.602
There are four more
brothers plus Luciano.

00:46.637 --> 00:48.337
How are we supposed
to get to them now?

00:48.372 --> 00:50.006
Pack lightly.
We'll meet here.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.574
Where are the Dittrichs?

00:51.609 --> 00:54.177
Snuck out yesterday,
dead of night.

00:55.613 --> 00:57.747
- Fletcher gets elected.
- You're telling me?

00:57.781 --> 00:59.448
This is my life on the line!

00:59.483 --> 01:01.884
- I'm making a change.
- Eli's out?

01:01.918 --> 01:05.354
Deputy Halloran, the star is yours
to wear, if you'll honor us so.

01:05.388 --> 01:06.722
Sure I will.

01:06.756 --> 01:08.056
I need men I can trust.

01:08.091 --> 01:09.791
You can trust me, God damn it.

01:09.826 --> 01:11.326
<i>What do I have to do
to convince you?</i>

01:11.361 --> 01:14.296
Look, what do you expect me...

01:18.235 --> 01:20.070
I won't have another child.

01:20.104 --> 01:21.605
That's not
your right to decide.

01:21.639 --> 01:24.407
What purpose did it serve
to make me a widow?

01:24.442 --> 01:27.377
I have not lost one second
of sleep over what was done.

01:27.412 --> 01:29.379
Neither have you.

01:31.615 --> 01:34.850
<i>- When I came back...
- They had disappeared.</i>

03:12.983 --> 03:15.384
"To Carthage then I came,

03:15.419 --> 03:17.886
where a cauldron
of unholy loves

03:17.921 --> 03:20.957
sang all about
mine ears."

03:20.991 --> 03:23.559
Those are the words
of Saint Augustine

03:23.593 --> 03:25.261
written 1500 years ago.

03:25.295 --> 03:27.997
His road to the lord
was an arduous one

03:28.031 --> 03:30.266
filled with many setbacks.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.802
In Carthage,
Carthage by the sea,

03:32.836 --> 03:35.671
<i>he found a city
devoted to appetite,</i>

03:35.705 --> 03:38.841
<i>to pleasure,
to the temptations</i>

03:38.875 --> 03:41.877
that keep us from our
better selves.

03:41.911 --> 03:44.079
And in that place
he did succumb

03:44.113 --> 03:46.047
to what was offered.

03:48.250 --> 03:51.119
He did succumb.

03:51.153 --> 03:53.588
Gentlemen, Atlantic City

03:53.622 --> 03:57.459
is the grandchild
of that vanished metropolis.

03:57.493 --> 04:00.929
Should you aspire
to replace me here,

04:00.963 --> 04:04.165
and should supervisor Elliot
accept you,

04:04.199 --> 04:06.634
you will be bribed, coerced

04:06.668 --> 04:09.237
and tempted on a daily basis.

04:09.271 --> 04:11.605
Bring on the dancing girls.

04:17.212 --> 04:19.980
My partner, Agent Eric Sebso,

04:20.014 --> 04:24.619
died in the line of duty
of a heart attack.

04:24.653 --> 04:27.455
I will not have
his memory sullied

04:27.489 --> 04:30.024
with infantile humor.

04:37.666 --> 04:41.235
The supervisor will review
your applications.

04:57.052 --> 05:00.954
Nelson, I wish
you'd reconsider.

05:00.989 --> 05:04.424
There's nothing here
for me, sir.

05:11.432 --> 05:14.333
<i>Did you see this?</i>

05:17.570 --> 05:20.071
Buy them drinks,
promise them jobs,

05:20.105 --> 05:22.173
do whatever you need to do
to get your people to vote.

05:22.208 --> 05:25.477
And once they do, send them over to
my ward and have them vote again.

05:25.511 --> 05:27.912
I still say replacing
Eli was a mistake.

05:27.947 --> 05:30.681
What "still"?
You never said a word about it.

05:30.716 --> 05:33.651
I want a big turnout Tuesday,

05:33.686 --> 05:35.620
men and women alike.

05:35.654 --> 05:37.388
Hell, Nuck,
you'll even get spooks.

05:37.422 --> 05:39.690
- The fuck you just say?
- What?

05:39.724 --> 05:43.261
I got my clerk combing the obituaries.
He's writing down names.

05:43.296 --> 05:47.031
Yet another Atlantic City
politician elected by dead people.

05:47.066 --> 05:48.900
It's Halloween, Ed.
Get in the spirit.

05:48.934 --> 05:52.503
Talk about your
absentee ballots.

05:52.538 --> 05:54.972
I hope you're half as amusing

05:55.007 --> 05:57.208
during your concession speech.

06:12.056 --> 06:13.657
We need to talk.

06:16.194 --> 06:19.096
Hey, come on.

06:20.866 --> 06:22.433
Let's go for a walk, guys.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.534
<i>Let's go blow the
stink off this place.</i>

06:27.704 --> 06:30.039
I've been approached
by the other side.

06:30.073 --> 06:32.008
Really?

06:32.042 --> 06:34.344
Fletcher and them
other democrats...

06:34.378 --> 06:37.547
They paint a nice, pretty
picture how it's gonna be

06:37.581 --> 06:40.316
if I throw my weight behind
them come election day.

06:40.350 --> 06:43.252
And savvy businessman
Chalky White believes them.

06:43.286 --> 06:45.287
Savvy businessman Chalky White

06:45.321 --> 06:47.722
tell them he believe them,

06:47.757 --> 06:49.757
then he pocket their money.

06:49.792 --> 06:53.795
I take it that means
you're sticking with me?

06:53.829 --> 06:57.098
Some recognition for my
loyalty would be nice.

07:02.237 --> 07:05.973
You realize you put the
bite on me every election?

07:06.007 --> 07:07.941
Except this time

07:07.976 --> 07:10.144
you could actually lose.

07:10.178 --> 07:12.780
What'd you have in mind?

07:12.814 --> 07:14.748
Oh,

07:14.783 --> 07:17.918
10 grand, a new car.

07:19.621 --> 07:23.090
And an invitation to that victory
party down at Babette's.

07:27.028 --> 07:29.362
That last part's
a tall order, Chalky.

07:29.397 --> 07:33.600
So is delivering 100%
of that colored vote.

07:37.605 --> 07:39.572
"Upon that night,
when fairies light

07:39.607 --> 07:42.342
beneath the moon's pale beams;

07:42.377 --> 07:45.446
there, up the cove,
they stray and rove

07:45.480 --> 07:48.381
and haunt
the Halloween."

07:48.416 --> 07:50.950
Boo!

07:50.985 --> 07:52.785
More, mama.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.755
That's all for now.
I need to finish the cake.

07:55.789 --> 07:57.757
You go and wash
your hands, please.

07:57.791 --> 07:59.859
And you help your sister.

07:59.893 --> 08:01.828
The poem...
Was that Frost?

08:01.862 --> 08:03.296
<i>Robert Burns.</i>

08:03.330 --> 08:06.199
My nana would read it each
year on All Hallows Eve.

08:06.233 --> 08:09.035
Will they recite it tonight
in the churchyard?

08:09.069 --> 08:10.870
That's more of
a religious service

08:10.905 --> 08:13.039
to pray for the souls
of the dead.

08:13.073 --> 08:16.743
You catholics certainly have
a flair for the dramatic.

08:16.777 --> 08:20.380
That we do.

08:20.414 --> 08:23.549
Warren loves poetry.

08:26.220 --> 08:29.622
Have you thought about
where you'll go

08:29.657 --> 08:31.557
<i>after Tuesday?</i>

08:31.592 --> 08:34.025
I hate to put you out,
but I'm sure

08:34.061 --> 08:37.029
Warren will send for us as
soon as he wins the election.

08:37.063 --> 08:40.198
I'm considering margate.

08:40.232 --> 08:43.703
I could get work
in one of the shops.

08:43.736 --> 08:45.704
Or perhaps I'll be rich.

08:45.739 --> 08:48.574
We'll see what the brack says.

08:48.608 --> 08:51.877
The cake...
It's called barmbrack.

08:51.911 --> 08:54.246
The Irish eat it on Halloween.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.682
You bake a sixpence, a ring

08:56.716 --> 08:58.583
and a small
piece of rag inside.

08:58.618 --> 09:01.086
<i>If you get the money,
you'll be rich.</i>

09:01.120 --> 09:03.688
The ring of course means
you'll be married.

09:03.723 --> 09:05.724
And if you get the rag, well,

09:05.758 --> 09:08.159
you'll be destitute.

09:09.829 --> 09:13.298
President Warren Harding.

09:13.332 --> 09:16.234
You'll come visit, of course,

09:16.268 --> 09:18.436
to the White House.

09:21.907 --> 09:25.109
And with the arsenic being
introduced slowly through food,

09:25.144 --> 09:27.378
the victim is often unaware
of being poisoned at all.

09:27.413 --> 09:29.714
He'd been complaining about
his stomach since Christmas.

09:29.748 --> 09:32.416
It would have to have been
going on for some time.

09:32.451 --> 09:35.687
<i>There were toxic levels in his
stew, in his tea biscuits.</i>

09:35.721 --> 09:37.888
Even his toothpaste
was tainted.

09:37.923 --> 09:40.591
How do you explain this,
Mrs. Pratt?

09:42.527 --> 09:45.696
Must have fell in there
somehow on accident.

09:45.730 --> 09:47.965
Yet your food
was uncontaminated.

09:47.999 --> 09:51.135
She killed Jerry,
for God's sake.

09:51.169 --> 09:53.337
I ate one of those
cookies, you know.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.040
Who's Jerry?

09:56.074 --> 09:58.675
His dog. He used to
feed him his leftovers.

09:58.710 --> 10:01.178
Treat that dog better than me.

10:01.212 --> 10:05.549
Best goddamned friend I had,
I can tell you that much.

10:05.584 --> 10:08.019
You goddamn ignorant bitch,

10:08.053 --> 10:09.854
after all I did for you.

10:09.888 --> 10:11.889
- Calm down, dear.
- The hell I will.

10:11.924 --> 10:13.657
She's a fucking murderer!

10:17.695 --> 10:19.430
Why did you do this?

10:19.464 --> 10:21.932
Poison him?

10:24.369 --> 10:27.271
'Cause

10:27.305 --> 10:30.974
if I used a shotgun,

10:31.009 --> 10:35.679
I'd have had to clean
the mess up myself.

10:35.713 --> 10:40.984
<i>I had all I could take
of his abuse.</i>

10:43.555 --> 10:45.656
Are you gonna arrest her
or not, sheriff?

10:45.690 --> 10:48.392
<i>No.</i>

10:48.427 --> 10:49.994
He's not.

10:50.028 --> 10:51.162
What?

10:51.196 --> 10:53.531
Come with me.

11:02.974 --> 11:06.043
I certainly understand
why you'd want to,

11:06.077 --> 11:08.245
but you can't go around
poisoning people.

11:08.279 --> 11:10.781
The hell's going on?

11:10.815 --> 11:12.716
<i>Just let him
handle it, dear.</i>

11:15.386 --> 11:16.486
Relax.

11:16.521 --> 11:19.289
Take this and go far away.

11:19.324 --> 11:21.892
Change your name
and don't come back.

11:21.926 --> 11:23.860
God bless you, sir.

11:23.895 --> 11:26.597
<i>- Bless you.
- Simmer yourself down.</i>

11:26.631 --> 11:29.233
<i>- And you be careful.
- It's okay.</i>

11:29.267 --> 11:31.535
It's not worth
giving yourself a fit.

11:31.569 --> 11:33.737
You take this.

11:40.044 --> 11:42.712
- What the hell are you doing, Nucky?
- Relax.

11:42.746 --> 11:45.915
<i>She's tried to kill me,
God damn it.</i>

11:53.925 --> 11:57.494
I've booked passage
for myself and Carolyn.

11:57.528 --> 11:59.529
Should I be indicted
personally...

11:59.563 --> 12:01.998
and my attorney assures
me that's imminent...

12:02.032 --> 12:04.467
He'll let you know
how to get in touch.

12:04.501 --> 12:06.435
Scotland in November?

12:06.470 --> 12:08.437
I hear the golfing is terrific.

12:08.472 --> 12:10.406
- Sure, in June maybe.
- Trick or treat!

12:10.441 --> 12:13.743
I'll tour the distilleries,
take up the bagpipes perhaps.

12:13.777 --> 12:15.812
There are any number
of ways to occupy myself

12:15.846 --> 12:18.748
until this baseball
business goes away.

12:18.782 --> 12:21.284
If you're indicted, it
don't sound like it will.

12:21.318 --> 12:24.287
Ain't there anybody in Chicago
whose palm you can grease?

12:24.321 --> 12:26.822
It's the world series, Charlie.

12:26.857 --> 12:29.726
I'm a pariah,
haven't you heard?

12:29.760 --> 12:31.428
So use a buffer.

12:31.462 --> 12:33.297
There's Johnny Torrio.

12:33.331 --> 12:34.631
He's new out there,

12:34.666 --> 12:36.667
doesn't have the political
connections.

12:36.701 --> 12:38.569
Nucky Thompson does.

12:38.603 --> 12:40.270
And Torrio can
connect you to him.

12:40.304 --> 12:43.572
Thompson's not exactly
a pal these days, is he?

12:44.641 --> 12:47.309
This war we're in...

12:47.344 --> 12:49.512
Charlie and I were talking...

12:49.546 --> 12:51.780
There's no percentage in it.

12:51.815 --> 12:53.782
I mean, I know I brung them in,

12:53.816 --> 12:56.117
but these greaseballs,
these D'Alessio brothers...

12:56.151 --> 12:58.086
not your best suggestion.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.888
You're a businessman, right?

12:59.922 --> 13:02.090
Maybe you cut your losses.

13:02.124 --> 13:04.425
I didn't realize I was
paying you boys for advice.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.661
Well, the advice is free.

13:06.695 --> 13:08.896
You pay us 'cause we'll
get our hands dirty.

13:33.889 --> 13:36.557
Hey.

13:36.591 --> 13:39.426
What are you
supposed to be, huh?

13:44.499 --> 13:46.467
Hey, Tommy,
I asked you a question.

13:46.501 --> 13:49.169
- Pirate.
- Pirate?

13:50.805 --> 13:52.773
Hey, why don't you go
put your shoes on

13:52.807 --> 13:55.175
and get ready for that party?

14:08.823 --> 14:10.890
You gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

14:14.228 --> 14:16.797
How long are you gonna
keep on doing this?

14:16.831 --> 14:18.665
Doing what?

14:18.700 --> 14:20.934
The silences,

14:20.969 --> 14:23.403
the cold shoulder,
the distrustful looks.

14:23.438 --> 14:24.905
If I was a different
sort of man,

14:24.939 --> 14:26.740
it would be worse than looks.

14:26.774 --> 14:29.509
For God's sake, Jimmy,
do you want us to leave?

14:29.544 --> 14:32.345
What do you mean "us"?

14:32.380 --> 14:36.016
He's my son too, Angela.

14:36.050 --> 14:37.751
And what's wrong with him?

14:37.785 --> 14:39.686
Nothing's wrong with him.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.921
He's disrespectful.

14:41.955 --> 14:44.590
He's terrified of you.

14:47.661 --> 14:48.861
We both are.

14:48.895 --> 14:52.665
What are you talking about?

14:52.699 --> 14:56.369
You did it again last night.

14:58.305 --> 15:00.640
You were screaming
in your sleep.

15:03.410 --> 15:04.543
What?

15:04.578 --> 15:08.347
You grabbed me.
You were shaking me,

15:08.381 --> 15:11.517
yelling something in German.

15:11.551 --> 15:13.485
Your eyes were open,

15:13.520 --> 15:16.588
but you weren't there, Jimmy.

15:19.058 --> 15:21.827
I'm afraid
you're gonna hurt us.

15:26.032 --> 15:28.867
I want to protect you

15:28.901 --> 15:32.704
and Tommy.

15:38.577 --> 15:41.213
Sit down.

15:46.518 --> 15:48.920
I didn't write you

15:48.954 --> 15:51.422
when I was away in France

15:51.457 --> 15:55.193
because I didn't think
I was coming back.

15:55.227 --> 15:57.662
There are things inside me

15:57.696 --> 16:01.499
that I brought home
from the war.

16:01.533 --> 16:04.135
But there were nights
over there

16:04.169 --> 16:07.972
in the trenches, I'd be asleep,

16:08.006 --> 16:11.509
dream that I could
feel you next to me,

16:11.543 --> 16:15.012
that I could touch
your hair against my face.

16:17.815 --> 16:20.116
You and Tommy, you're...

16:24.221 --> 16:26.856
We both did things

16:26.891 --> 16:29.091
when we were apart

16:29.126 --> 16:32.060
for whatever reason.

16:34.731 --> 16:37.866
Were you in love with her?

16:42.506 --> 16:45.308
I was lonely, Jimmy.

16:47.177 --> 16:50.847
I want to start fresh.

16:52.216 --> 16:55.786
I want to go back
to where we were.

16:58.856 --> 17:01.758
Can you do that?

17:03.094 --> 17:05.762
I think so.

17:05.796 --> 17:08.098
Can you?

17:11.102 --> 17:13.336
I'll try.

17:34.591 --> 17:37.660
<i>And on this eve
of All Hallows,</i>

17:37.694 --> 17:39.795
<i>we honor the saints</i>

17:39.829 --> 17:42.965
<i>and now pray for the souls
of the dead.</i>

17:42.999 --> 17:46.168
O lord, hear my prayer,

17:46.202 --> 17:49.438
listen to my cry for mercy;

17:49.472 --> 17:52.808
and in your faithfulness
and righteousness

17:52.843 --> 17:54.677
come to my relief.

17:54.712 --> 17:59.015
Do not bring your servant
unto judgment,

17:59.049 --> 18:00.983
for no one living

18:01.017 --> 18:04.286
is righteous before you.

18:05.588 --> 18:08.456
Do you pray much yourself?

18:08.491 --> 18:10.625
<i>- For the children mostly...
- Lord have mercy on us.</i>

18:10.660 --> 18:12.360
<i>- ...For their health...
- Christ...</i>

18:12.395 --> 18:14.796
<i>- ...And the ones I lost, of course.
- ...Have mercy on us.</i>

18:14.830 --> 18:16.464
And I pray for forgiveness.

18:16.498 --> 18:18.900
- For what?
- My own sins.

18:18.934 --> 18:20.602
Holy Mary, mother of God...

18:20.636 --> 18:22.637
<i>There's such a
peacefulness here,</i>

18:22.671 --> 18:24.972
<i>a special kind
of quiet.</i>

18:25.006 --> 18:28.041
It's like walking through a
wood on a crisp autumn...

18:30.478 --> 18:31.912
Oh.

18:34.715 --> 18:37.951
<i>...From the snares of the devil,</i>

18:37.985 --> 18:41.187
<i>from anger and hate...</i>

18:41.222 --> 18:43.723
So you have that in common.

18:46.660 --> 18:49.929
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to upset you.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.498
Mr. Thompson...
in Chicago...

18:52.533 --> 18:55.634
He told me he had
a son who died.

18:59.940 --> 19:02.308
<i>It's not suspicion.
It's prudence.</i>

19:02.342 --> 19:05.311
Come on, Nuck,
how long we know each other?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.546
I'd like to know what
I'll be walking into, John.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.981
<i>A business meeting</i>

19:09.015 --> 19:11.483
for which I'm asking you
to keep an open mind.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.986
I already bought the Brooklyn Bridge,
if that's what you're selling.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.889
<i>Noon tomorrow.
We'll pick a spot out by you.</i>

19:16.923 --> 19:18.189
Ow, God damn it.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.925
The train.
How you think?

19:20.960 --> 19:23.194
<i>Go see who that is.</i>

19:23.228 --> 19:24.595
What?

19:24.630 --> 19:26.430
<i>I'm on
the overnight train.</i>

19:26.465 --> 19:28.599
<i>The fuck's going on
over there?</i>

19:28.633 --> 19:31.168
Nothing.
I'm late for a party.

19:31.202 --> 19:33.770
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

19:53.455 --> 19:55.957
<i>Yes?</i>

19:55.991 --> 19:58.760
Someone wishes to see you.

20:11.140 --> 20:14.108
Leave it on.
It suits you...

20:14.143 --> 20:17.678
A dapper villain
in a Sunday serial.

20:17.713 --> 20:19.147
And you?

20:19.181 --> 20:21.149
What's your
get-up tonight...

20:21.183 --> 20:23.785
The devoted, pleading wife,

20:23.819 --> 20:25.820
the temperance firebrand,

20:25.854 --> 20:28.523
the crusading suffragette?

20:28.557 --> 20:31.292
You left out
"kept woman."

20:31.326 --> 20:34.662
But there wasn't any
keeping you, was there?

20:34.696 --> 20:38.999
When you met me I was pregnant.

20:39.034 --> 20:41.836
And then I lost the baby.

20:43.839 --> 20:46.941
<i>You lost a child...</i>

20:46.975 --> 20:49.276
<i>a son,</i>

20:49.311 --> 20:51.212
he was six days old...

20:51.246 --> 20:54.048
and your wife a month later.

20:54.082 --> 20:56.750
It's a bit late for this
game, wouldn't you say?

20:56.785 --> 20:59.286
<i>- What game?
- I tell you my sorrows.</i>

20:59.321 --> 21:01.455
You pretend to be sympathetic.

21:01.489 --> 21:02.956
And we wind up in bed.

21:02.991 --> 21:05.793
I can assure you
that won't happen.

21:09.831 --> 21:12.299
<i>Why are you here?</i>

21:12.333 --> 21:16.803
To find out
who Enoch Thompson is.

21:23.211 --> 21:27.180
Seven years ago, almost eight,

21:27.214 --> 21:31.084
I'd just become treasurer.

21:31.118 --> 21:35.121
I was new to the job,
very busy.

21:35.156 --> 21:38.958
My wife had just given birth.

21:38.993 --> 21:42.796
We named him Enoch after me.

21:42.830 --> 21:45.331
She wanted that.

21:52.071 --> 21:55.307
He was tiny, frail.

21:55.341 --> 21:59.611
I was terrified to hold him.

21:59.646 --> 22:02.381
A week passed.

22:02.416 --> 22:04.684
I had my hands full

22:04.718 --> 22:08.955
with some county business
or another, an audit.

22:08.989 --> 22:12.758
I was busy, very busy.

22:14.628 --> 22:17.496
I came home one night.

22:17.530 --> 22:19.498
It was late.

22:19.532 --> 22:21.500
She was in the nursery,

22:21.534 --> 22:24.537
rocking him in her arms.

22:24.571 --> 22:26.839
I crossed to them.

22:28.842 --> 22:31.410
She looked so calm,

22:31.445 --> 22:33.546
so contented.

22:33.580 --> 22:38.217
It gave me the courage to
finally want to hold him.

22:39.286 --> 22:42.355
I pulled back the blanket.

22:55.836 --> 22:58.471
And I looked at his face.

22:59.806 --> 23:01.974
And I could tell right away

23:02.008 --> 23:05.277
he'd been dead for days.

23:06.746 --> 23:11.150
She'd been caring for him
nearly a week...

23:11.184 --> 23:13.118
bathing him,

23:13.153 --> 23:17.790
changing his diapers,
his bedclothes.

23:20.393 --> 23:23.395
I took him from her

23:23.429 --> 23:27.065
and cradled him in my arms.

23:27.099 --> 23:30.735
That was the only time
I ever held him.

23:33.172 --> 23:36.141
We buried him
in the churchyard,

23:36.175 --> 23:38.743
but she couldn't accept it.

23:38.777 --> 23:43.281
She'd completely broken
with reality...

23:43.315 --> 23:46.084
melancholia.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.421
I saw it.

23:50.456 --> 23:52.590
I knew it.

23:52.624 --> 23:57.295
But the doctor said
time would heal her.

23:57.329 --> 24:02.900
And I was very very busy.

24:07.806 --> 24:09.740
A few weeks later

24:09.774 --> 24:14.011
she slashed her wrists
with my razor.

24:25.256 --> 24:28.925
The times with you
and the children

24:28.960 --> 24:31.461
in the house,

24:31.496 --> 24:33.897
eating breakfast...

24:33.931 --> 24:36.066
just that...

24:36.100 --> 24:41.004
I've never been happier

24:41.038 --> 24:44.674
or more terrified in my life.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.246
And now you know more about me

24:49.280 --> 24:52.382
than any other person on earth.

24:53.617 --> 24:57.620
<i>And you thought
I needed saving.</i>

24:57.655 --> 25:00.089
Didn't you?

25:02.493 --> 25:04.827
Not the way you chose.

25:11.201 --> 25:14.170
You'll leave Atlantic City?

25:15.973 --> 25:18.374
Is that your demand?

25:18.408 --> 25:20.810
It's just a question.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.248
I think it might be
for the best.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.856
- Let me...
- No.

25:33.890 --> 25:36.058
Thank you.

25:42.332 --> 25:46.034
There's a kindness in you.

25:46.069 --> 25:48.804
I know it.

25:50.239 --> 25:53.241
How can you do what you do?

25:54.310 --> 25:57.112
We all have to
decide for ourselves

25:57.146 --> 25:59.848
how much sin we can live with.

26:03.453 --> 26:05.454
Mr. Thompson.

26:05.488 --> 26:08.423
Mrs. Schroeder.

26:08.457 --> 26:13.061
I'm pleased to have finally
made your acquaintance.

26:35.484 --> 26:37.451
Would you care for a biscuit?

26:37.486 --> 26:39.653
The molasses hurts my filling.

26:45.660 --> 26:47.995
I was offered
a permanent assignment

26:48.029 --> 26:50.130
in Atlantic City.

26:50.164 --> 26:52.499
I discovered a large still

26:52.533 --> 26:54.401
near where Sebso expired.

26:54.435 --> 26:58.505
We had originally gone to
the area looking for it.

26:58.539 --> 27:01.007
Your supervisor
must have been pleased.

27:01.042 --> 27:02.208
He was.

27:02.243 --> 27:04.077
I was offered a raise in pay

27:04.112 --> 27:06.813
as well as two additional
agents under my command.

27:06.848 --> 27:08.748
That's wonderful.

27:08.783 --> 27:12.619
I turned him down.

27:12.653 --> 27:15.121
My Uncle Byron...

27:15.156 --> 27:18.158
I never told you this,
but a year ago

27:18.192 --> 27:21.261
last Easter he made me
a proposition...

27:21.295 --> 27:24.464
full partner
in his feed business.

27:24.498 --> 27:27.100
In Schenectady.

27:27.134 --> 27:28.768
You enjoyed our visit there...

27:28.802 --> 27:31.304
the winter with the snowshoes.

27:33.006 --> 27:35.608
Of course I'd have to buy in,

27:35.642 --> 27:39.078
but it's a going concern.

27:46.887 --> 27:49.088
You're being awfully quiet.

27:50.490 --> 27:53.626
I like being the wife
of a federal agent.

27:53.660 --> 27:56.796
Is that what's important...
your vanity,

27:56.830 --> 27:59.598
what your friends think
down at the Greengrocer's?

27:59.633 --> 28:00.766
Of course not.

28:00.801 --> 28:03.936
I'm unhappy, Rose,

28:03.970 --> 28:05.337
unfulfilled,

28:05.372 --> 28:09.809
increasingly so
these last few months.

28:12.079 --> 28:16.015
And now with
Agent's Sebso's death...

28:19.919 --> 28:24.256
You're doing God's work
there, Nelson.

28:27.260 --> 28:30.762
Then if God wants me
to stay in Atlantic City,

28:30.797 --> 28:33.198
let him give me a sign.

29:39.064 --> 29:40.364
What the hell is this?

29:40.399 --> 29:42.299
Thanks for coming.

29:42.334 --> 29:44.668
- How're you doing, kid?
- Mr. Torrio.

29:44.703 --> 29:46.337
I don't like being sandbagged.

29:46.371 --> 29:48.839
Come on, eh?
Costs nothing to listen.

29:51.909 --> 29:54.177
Then start talking.

29:55.413 --> 29:57.747
The last time
we was all together,

29:57.782 --> 29:59.616
there was
another man as well...

29:59.650 --> 30:01.985
- Big Jim Colosimo.
- May he rest in peace.

30:02.019 --> 30:05.088
He was a good man... Jim. Don't get me
wrong. But he didn't look ahead.

30:05.122 --> 30:08.724
He didn't look from behind neither,
from what Frankie Yale told me.

30:08.759 --> 30:10.426
Grow up, eh?

30:10.460 --> 30:12.228
With the stupid jokes.

30:12.262 --> 30:16.098
My point is, to survive
in a business like ours,

30:16.133 --> 30:18.701
you gotta look to the future.

30:18.735 --> 30:21.470
And to do that, sometimes you
gotta let go of the past.

30:21.505 --> 30:24.006
It was Arnold reached out,
asked that we meet.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.208
The son of a bitch
tried to have me killed.

30:26.243 --> 30:29.378
I'm interested, Mr. Thompson, in
putting an end to our hostilities.

30:29.412 --> 30:32.548
I would think you would be,
considering the way things are going.

30:32.582 --> 30:35.784
We could wage war for years.

30:35.819 --> 30:38.854
It benefits no one.
And the fact is

30:38.888 --> 30:41.123
I have enough problems already.

30:41.157 --> 30:42.658
Yes, I've seen the newspapers.

30:42.692 --> 30:45.327
Then you know I'm about to be
indicted for fixing the World Series.

30:45.362 --> 30:47.329
- So pay someone off.
- There's the rub.

30:47.364 --> 30:49.932
Though I'm quite
well known in Chicago,

30:49.966 --> 30:51.867
I'm decidedly not
well liked there.

30:51.901 --> 30:54.236
It sounds to me like
you're asking for a favor.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.371
I'm asking to make a deal.

30:56.406 --> 31:00.109
I need a man with your political
reach to quash the indictment.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.983
- That could be arranged.
- What?

31:08.017 --> 31:10.752
We're talking.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.458
In exchange for what?

31:16.492 --> 31:19.661
One million in cash.

31:23.199 --> 31:25.767
A million dollars.

31:25.801 --> 31:29.204
And the location of the
remaining D'Alessio brothers.

31:30.673 --> 31:33.041
Or you could take
your chances in Chicago

31:33.075 --> 31:35.577
with my good friend
Hartley Replogle.

31:35.611 --> 31:37.445
The state's attorney.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.614
So you've seen the papers also.

31:46.789 --> 31:48.590
This war ends here.

31:48.624 --> 31:50.558
Any bad blood,

31:50.593 --> 31:52.961
past transgressions
of whatever nature,

31:52.995 --> 31:55.497
business or personal,
are hereby nullified.

31:59.802 --> 32:01.769
I'll have the cash delivered
to you in the morning.

32:01.803 --> 32:04.238
Charlie here has the other
information you want.

32:04.273 --> 32:06.507
Good luck,
Mr. Thompson.

32:06.541 --> 32:09.343
And I do hope we haven't
seen the last of each other.

32:09.378 --> 32:12.113
Now if you'll excuse me,

32:12.147 --> 32:14.748
I've got a train to Chicago.

32:27.929 --> 32:29.863
Get my brother
on the phone, then call

32:29.897 --> 32:32.366
an emergency press conference
today at city hall.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.167
- What time?
- 3:00 P.M. sharp.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.670
I want every newspaper
in the county there.

32:48.917 --> 32:51.384
<i>Gentlemen of
the fourth estate,</i>

32:51.419 --> 32:54.087
tragic though it is,
I need hardly remind you

32:54.122 --> 32:56.723
that the passage
of the 18th amendment

32:56.758 --> 32:59.226
<i>has given rise to
a new breed of criminal...</i>

32:59.260 --> 33:01.161
<i>vicious thugs</i>

33:01.195 --> 33:04.998
<i>emboldened by the promise
of an easy dollar.</i>

33:06.267 --> 33:08.034
What the fuck are you doing?

33:08.068 --> 33:10.003
Halloween's over.

33:15.242 --> 33:17.343
<i>Last January,
in the woods</i>

33:17.378 --> 33:19.946
<i>only a few miles from where
I speak to you today,</i>

33:19.980 --> 33:23.683
<i>a horrible massacre
occurred.</i>

33:23.717 --> 33:26.419
<i>Five men,
bootleggers all,</i>

33:26.453 --> 33:30.356
<i>were cut down in cold blood
by a rival gang.</i>

33:30.390 --> 33:32.358
The suspected ringleader

33:32.392 --> 33:34.560
of the killers...
Hans Schroeder...

33:34.594 --> 33:37.029
was found dead days later,

33:37.063 --> 33:39.464
his body washed up
in a fishing net

33:39.499 --> 33:41.266
on one of our piers.

33:41.301 --> 33:45.204
Due to the tireless work
of my brother,

33:45.238 --> 33:47.773
<i>former sheriff
Eli Thompson,</i>

33:47.808 --> 33:50.009
<i>we have since learned</i>

33:50.043 --> 33:53.379
that Schroeder's conspirators
in this cowardly attack

33:53.413 --> 33:56.348
<i>were a group of killers
late of Philadelphia,</i>

33:56.383 --> 33:58.084
<i>well-known
to law enforcement</i>

33:58.118 --> 34:00.853
<i>as the D'Alessio brothers.</i>

34:00.887 --> 34:02.454
<i>I am happy to report</i>

34:02.489 --> 34:04.623
<i>they are being sought
for questioning</i>

34:04.658 --> 34:07.293
<i>as I speak.</i>

34:14.101 --> 34:16.436
<i>Motivated by
political gain,</i>

34:16.469 --> 34:18.438
the democrats have argued

34:18.472 --> 34:20.840
that the incumbent
administration

34:20.873 --> 34:23.208
has been rife with corruption,

34:23.243 --> 34:25.511
soft on crime.

34:25.545 --> 34:28.813
<i>On this election eve,
I submit to you this:</i>

34:28.849 --> 34:30.815
<i>While this heinous crime</i>

34:30.851 --> 34:33.853
<i>did certainly occur
on the republican watch,</i>

34:33.853 --> 34:36.489
<i>the apprehension
of those responsible</i>

34:36.523 --> 34:38.224
<i>did certainly occur
on the redid as well.</i>

34:57.309 --> 34:59.911
Vote for Edward Bader tomorrow

34:59.945 --> 35:02.146
and keep our city safe.

35:02.181 --> 35:04.182
I thank you all

35:04.216 --> 35:06.384
and God bless America.

35:08.554 --> 35:11.155
Mr. Thompson, how about
a picture with your brother?

35:13.225 --> 35:16.260
Mr. Thompson.
Mr. Thompson.

35:16.295 --> 35:19.063
No more pictures.
Let's go.

35:19.098 --> 35:20.998
Come on, go go go go.

35:33.378 --> 35:35.379
How are you today?
Nice to see you.

35:35.413 --> 35:37.080
Mr. Thompson, Mr. Thompson.

35:37.115 --> 35:38.815
All right, a good day to
vote, isn't it? Yes sir.

35:38.849 --> 35:40.784
Hey, how are you?
Hello, how are you?

35:40.818 --> 35:43.853
Nice to see you.
Congratulations, ladies.

35:43.888 --> 35:46.122
- A good day.
- Thank you.

35:46.157 --> 35:47.690
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

35:47.725 --> 35:49.992
All right, thanks for coming out.
Nice to see you.

35:50.027 --> 35:51.894
How are you?
Hello there.

35:51.928 --> 35:54.363
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you. Thanks for coming out.</i>

35:54.397 --> 35:56.498
- Hey, Mr. Thompson.
- How are you today? Hi, Francis.

35:56.533 --> 35:58.334
- How's your mother?
- Much better, Nucky.

35:58.368 --> 35:59.936
Hello, Bill.
How are you?

35:59.970 --> 36:03.073
- Good day, Mr. Thompson.
- Hi, Mr. Thompson.

36:03.107 --> 36:05.242
Hey there, Nuck.

36:09.815 --> 36:12.315
How are you?
Nice to see you today.

36:12.350 --> 36:15.284
Hey, squirt,
who you voting for?

36:15.318 --> 36:16.952
- Hey, good luck to you, Nucky.
- How are you?

36:16.986 --> 36:18.519
- Attaboy, Nuck.
- Hi.

36:18.554 --> 36:21.089
- Some turnout, eh?
- Say, Nuck, who you voting for?

36:21.123 --> 36:23.625
Ed Bader and the straight
republican ticket.

36:23.659 --> 36:25.660
And I suggest
you all do the same.

38:04.690 --> 38:07.024
Third ward results are in.

38:07.059 --> 38:09.093
We're up by over 20%.

38:12.364 --> 38:14.365
Easy, kid, eh?

38:14.399 --> 38:16.366
<i>- What, are you down a quart?

<i>- It's great times here.

38:21.906 --> 38:24.174
It just came over the wire...

38:24.208 --> 38:26.509
The state's attorney
in Chicago announced

38:26.544 --> 38:30.413
that Arnold Rothstein
will not be indicted.

38:30.447 --> 38:32.415
Anything on the Mayor's race?

38:32.449 --> 38:35.418
Well, the polls will be
closing shortly.

38:35.452 --> 38:37.687
Okay.

38:40.590 --> 38:43.125
Almost home, little brother.

38:43.160 --> 38:46.662
Just like that, eh?

38:46.697 --> 38:49.498
You wave your scepter and
everything's all forgiven?

38:49.532 --> 38:52.301
Your cut of the Rothstein
money isn't enough?

38:52.336 --> 38:53.703
Should I send flowers too?

38:53.737 --> 38:56.472
You fucked me over, brother.
You forget?

38:56.507 --> 38:59.175
And I told you
I'll make it right.

39:00.110 --> 39:02.979
You do this stuff...

39:03.013 --> 39:05.114
You say things.

39:05.149 --> 39:07.950
Maybe you're so used to spouting
bullshit, you don't realize it,

39:07.985 --> 39:09.885
but your words actually
do affect people.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.421
What's that...
Dale Carnegie?

39:12.456 --> 39:14.623
I'm fucking serious, Nucky.
There are consequences

39:14.658 --> 39:16.792
to what you say, to what you do

39:16.826 --> 39:19.761
that you can't buy yourself
out of with money.

39:20.897 --> 39:22.798
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.003
You have to trust me, Eli.

39:28.037 --> 39:29.838
What does that mean?

39:31.574 --> 39:35.044
That blood is thicker
than water.

39:35.078 --> 39:36.445
Yeah?

39:36.479 --> 39:39.014
Well, why'd it have
to be my blood?

39:39.048 --> 39:41.016
Happy days, boys, happy days.

39:41.050 --> 39:44.019
Edgar Caldwell from
campaign headquarters.

39:46.489 --> 39:48.658
Let me take this.

39:52.863 --> 39:55.531
Really?

39:56.833 --> 39:58.266
Hello.

40:05.807 --> 40:09.542
Frank Hague. What, did they
run you out of Jersey City?

40:09.577 --> 40:11.212
Who let the democrat in?

40:11.246 --> 40:12.680
You don't gotta be Irish

40:12.714 --> 40:14.649
to march in the St. Patty's day parade,
do you?

40:14.683 --> 40:17.553
No, but it helps. Come on.

40:17.587 --> 40:19.121
Good to see you.

40:19.155 --> 40:22.357
Gentlemen, fellow Republicans,

40:22.392 --> 40:24.459
may I have your
attention, please?

40:24.494 --> 40:26.995
I have just been informed
that as of three minutes ago,

40:27.029 --> 40:29.330
Atlantic City
has a new Mayor...

40:29.365 --> 40:31.232
Mr. Edward Bader.

40:34.036 --> 40:36.004
Congratulations.

40:37.408 --> 40:39.142
Thank you one and all

40:39.176 --> 40:41.511
for your kind applause
and your generous support.

40:41.545 --> 40:43.513
Now being a man of action,

40:43.547 --> 40:45.748
I feel I should get
right down to business.

40:45.783 --> 40:47.784
Sheriff Halloran.

40:47.818 --> 40:49.452
At your service,
Mr. Mayor.

40:49.486 --> 40:51.454
Sheriff Halloran,
after your long

40:51.488 --> 40:53.990
and meritorious service
to Atlantic City,

40:54.024 --> 40:57.159
I regretfully accept
your resignation.

41:00.130 --> 41:02.331
Is this a joke?

41:02.365 --> 41:05.201
Relax, kid.
It's what Nucky wants.

41:07.537 --> 41:10.506
And now, as my second
official act as Mayor,

41:10.540 --> 41:12.341
it is my pleasure to reappoint

41:12.375 --> 41:16.111
my good friend Eli Thompson
as sheriff of Atlantic County.

41:16.145 --> 41:17.880
Hear hear.

41:19.983 --> 41:22.451
Welcome back, Eli.

41:29.159 --> 41:31.226
Well, looks like there's
a new sheriff in town.

41:31.261 --> 41:33.529
Jimmy.

41:33.563 --> 41:35.464
You're looking well.

41:35.498 --> 41:38.300
Good old Paddy Ryan,

41:38.334 --> 41:41.236
chief clerk of the fourth ward.

41:41.271 --> 41:43.205
How you been?

41:43.239 --> 41:45.274
I'm aces, Paddy.

41:45.308 --> 41:47.109
How's life in politics?

41:47.143 --> 41:48.577
Swell.

41:48.611 --> 41:50.812
Nuck's taking good care of me.

41:52.915 --> 41:54.983
He must have pimped out
your mother as well.

41:55.018 --> 41:56.952
I beg your pardon?

41:56.986 --> 41:59.488
Your mother... He must have
pimped your mother out as well.

42:01.757 --> 42:04.092
The fuck is wrong with you?

42:04.127 --> 42:06.061
What?

42:07.896 --> 42:10.097
Nothing.

42:10.132 --> 42:12.733
You're my hero.

42:12.768 --> 42:14.235
What are you talking about?

42:14.269 --> 42:18.373
The way you work, Nuck,
you're like a machine...

42:18.407 --> 42:21.643
clean, fast, totally
devoid of any emotion.

42:21.677 --> 42:22.944
Halloran wasn't working out.

42:22.978 --> 42:25.213
Halloran?
You'll use anyone, Nuck...

42:25.247 --> 42:28.416
man, woman,
13-year-old girl.

42:29.919 --> 42:33.054
She was an orphan, James,

42:33.088 --> 42:34.989
living in a home
for wayward children.

42:35.024 --> 42:36.858
The commodore took
good care of her.

42:36.892 --> 42:39.594
I'll bet he did.
And then you took care of me.

42:39.628 --> 42:41.663
Well, I did, didn't I?

42:41.697 --> 42:43.831
Did you ever want for anything,

42:43.866 --> 42:46.634
need anything?
You ever miss a meal?

42:54.510 --> 42:56.477
So the learning at your feet,

42:56.512 --> 42:58.479
getting me into Princeton...

42:58.513 --> 43:00.414
That was all guilt, huh?

43:00.449 --> 43:02.450
Guilt, duty.

43:02.484 --> 43:05.453
You're a grown man now.
What difference does it make?

43:06.488 --> 43:09.423
I thought you loved me.

43:10.759 --> 43:13.494
I'm not your father, James.

43:15.731 --> 43:17.498
You're right.

43:17.533 --> 43:19.500
I'm going to go
take it up with him.

43:19.534 --> 43:22.236
Why don't you
do yourself a favor?

43:22.271 --> 43:24.872
Go home to your wife
and sober up.

43:24.907 --> 43:27.642
Why don't you do me
a favor, Nuck?

43:27.676 --> 43:30.678
Stop acting
like you give a shit.

43:40.722 --> 43:43.256
Oh, come on now,
everyone eat your cake.

43:43.291 --> 43:45.492
We still haven't found
the surprises.

43:48.563 --> 43:50.296
Anything in there?

43:50.331 --> 43:51.964
No.

43:57.838 --> 44:00.307
The ring.

44:00.341 --> 44:02.475
It means I'll be
married, right?

44:02.510 --> 44:05.545
May it bring you better luck
than it did me.

44:05.579 --> 44:09.549
The first lady
of the United States.

44:16.757 --> 44:19.258
What will you do, nan,

44:19.292 --> 44:22.194
if he doesn't send for you?

44:25.098 --> 44:28.568
Well, of course he will.
He said.

44:31.471 --> 44:33.573
I didn't get a prize.

44:33.607 --> 44:37.510
Well there's still
more cake left, dear.

44:41.415 --> 44:42.782
The rag.

44:44.518 --> 44:47.854
What does that mean, mama?

44:49.957 --> 44:52.358
Nothing, dear.

44:52.393 --> 44:55.428
It's just a silly superstition.

45:12.813 --> 45:14.180
- Sir.
- Hmm?

45:14.214 --> 45:16.682
There's some woman out front.
She's looking for you.

45:16.683 --> 45:20.019
Send her in.

45:52.951 --> 45:56.320
I went to your grooming house.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.989
The landlady told me
you worked here.

45:59.024 --> 46:01.992
What do you want?

46:06.031 --> 46:08.766
You a postman, Nelson?

46:09.935 --> 46:13.971
No, I'm a prohibition agent.

46:15.373 --> 46:18.208
Hmm.

46:20.845 --> 46:22.980
Well, you made me pregnant.

46:33.558 --> 46:35.860
Come on now.
Warm milk.

46:37.796 --> 46:40.664
Put a little brandy
in it, will you?

46:40.699 --> 46:43.567
We're trying to rebuild
your stomach lining.

46:43.602 --> 46:45.736
Well, cook me a steak.

46:50.842 --> 46:53.477
So we're a happy family
all of a sudden?

46:53.511 --> 46:56.913
You don't have to be
so fretful all the time.

46:56.948 --> 47:00.617
I'll make you some eggs.

47:04.088 --> 47:07.224
Jimmy, give me some of that.

47:30.614 --> 47:32.415
You realize this is
the first time

47:32.449 --> 47:34.083
we've ever had
a drink together?

47:34.118 --> 47:36.819
Don't tell your mother.

47:41.091 --> 47:44.727
The woman tries to kill me

47:44.761 --> 47:47.630
and Nucky lets her go.

47:47.664 --> 47:50.567
He's got an odd
sense of justice.

47:50.601 --> 47:52.735
Talk to me about justice?

47:52.770 --> 47:55.672
Fucking Woodrow Wilson,
when was governor...

47:55.706 --> 47:58.975
goddamn southern son of a bitch

47:59.009 --> 48:00.977
comes here to try to make
a name for himself

48:01.011 --> 48:03.146
so he can run for president.

48:03.180 --> 48:05.281
He's the reason
you went to jail.

48:05.316 --> 48:07.450
No, he's the reason
I got convicted.

48:07.485 --> 48:10.420
Nucky's the reason
I went to jail.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.561
What do you mean?

48:18.595 --> 48:20.563
Well, he was sheriff
at the time.

48:20.597 --> 48:23.633
We got caught up in some
election-rigging case.

48:23.667 --> 48:26.102
They couldn't get us both,
so this fucking Wilson

48:26.136 --> 48:28.538
makes a deal
with the prosecutor...

48:28.572 --> 48:31.807
One of us takes the fall;
Wilson gets the headline;

48:31.841 --> 48:34.743
the rest of the case goes away.

48:34.778 --> 48:36.678
Why you and not Nucky?

48:36.713 --> 48:40.249
I was hurt politically and
Nucky was the fair-haired boy.

48:40.283 --> 48:42.217
The plan was for me to go away.

48:42.252 --> 48:46.121
He'd take over and then square
things up when I got out.

48:46.155 --> 48:47.422
Did he?

48:47.457 --> 48:49.124
He squared things up all right.

48:49.158 --> 48:51.092
Five years in jail

48:51.127 --> 48:54.195
and I was just
a distant memory.

48:54.230 --> 48:56.898
<i>And there he is
with a diamond stick pin</i>

48:56.933 --> 49:00.402
and a Rolls-fucking-Royce...

49:00.436 --> 49:02.370
Nucky Thompson,

49:02.405 --> 49:05.974
the spawn of a drunken piney.

49:26.595 --> 49:29.730
I used to hate coming
here when I was a kid.

49:29.765 --> 49:32.633
My mother would bring
me here to see you.

49:35.003 --> 49:37.238
I know.

49:37.272 --> 49:39.907
I was afraid of
all the animals.

49:39.941 --> 49:42.076
I was afraid of you.

49:44.012 --> 49:46.713
Nucky told me, "it's your duty.

49:46.748 --> 49:48.849
Gotta be strong
for your mother."

49:48.883 --> 49:53.653
Manipulative son of a bitch.

49:53.688 --> 49:56.523
He can be.

50:01.462 --> 50:04.030
Jimmy,

50:04.065 --> 50:07.467
you think I don't know
why he brought you back

50:07.501 --> 50:09.736
from Chicago?

50:09.770 --> 50:12.906
To do what he doesn't
have the stomach for.

50:12.940 --> 50:15.942
And you said yes.

50:15.976 --> 50:19.312
What for?
A few percent off top?

50:19.346 --> 50:20.847
I made a good deal.

50:20.881 --> 50:23.750
Oh God, he made you
think you did.

50:23.784 --> 50:25.752
He made me think I did.

50:25.786 --> 50:27.687
That's the way he operates.

50:27.721 --> 50:29.823
You know him well.

50:29.857 --> 50:32.025
He was like a son to me.

50:32.059 --> 50:35.361
But you're my
flesh and blood, boy.

50:37.497 --> 50:39.298
So?

50:39.332 --> 50:43.536
So you're gonna take back
Atlantic City

50:43.570 --> 50:45.404
for the both of us.

50:46.773 --> 50:50.009
And how is that
supposed to work?

50:50.043 --> 50:52.778
Look around, son.

50:52.813 --> 50:56.449
I didn't get all this
by being stupid.

50:58.318 --> 51:01.353
Sir.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.601
You told him what we discussed?

51:16.636 --> 51:19.771
I was just about to.

51:26.612 --> 51:28.413
<i>So, you see,
if I were president,</i>

51:28.447 --> 51:30.314
<i>I'd run the country
like a Broadway show.</i>

51:30.349 --> 51:32.650
I'd pick my cabinet
and try them out

51:32.684 --> 51:34.952
right here in Atlantic City.

51:34.987 --> 51:38.255
Oh yes, the best audiences.

51:38.290 --> 51:40.258
And if they clicked here,
I'd let them open

51:40.292 --> 51:43.328
in New York
and a few other cities.

51:43.362 --> 51:46.365
We'd do one-night stands
for four years

51:46.399 --> 51:48.334
and by then they'd
have to reelect me

51:48.368 --> 51:50.870
so I could actually do
something at the White House.

52:25.805 --> 52:28.472
Mr. Thompson.
Mr. Thompson.

52:30.809 --> 52:32.876
Howdy do?

52:32.911 --> 52:37.013
Baxter, it's nice to see you.

52:37.048 --> 52:39.316
I see you've met Annabelle.

52:39.350 --> 52:41.618
George was telling me all
about the cutlery business.

52:41.652 --> 52:45.488
Oh yeah, I'll knife you and
spoon you and fork you as well.

52:47.491 --> 52:49.826
How about a dance?

53:36.741 --> 53:38.374
Margaret.

53:38.409 --> 53:40.009
Hello.

53:40.044 --> 53:42.812
What a pleasant surprise.

53:44.582 --> 53:46.749
Heard the news
about Mayor Bader.

53:46.784 --> 53:48.718
Congratulations.

53:48.752 --> 53:51.654
Well, I certainly owe
a debt of gratitude to you.

53:51.689 --> 53:54.190
Then you could
offer me a drink.

53:57.127 --> 53:59.295
Is champagne okay?

53:59.330 --> 54:03.333
Good news just isn't
the same without it.

54:13.510 --> 54:15.278
How are the children?

54:18.048 --> 54:20.649
They miss their Uncle Nucky.

54:24.054 --> 54:26.188
Quiet, everyone!
Quiet. Quiet.
