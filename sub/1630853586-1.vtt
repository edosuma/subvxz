WEBVTT

00:21.041 --> 00:22.125
Okay, Ray,

00:22.208 --> 00:26.166
you are an incarcerated volunteer
in the Spiderhead clinical trial program.

00:26.250 --> 00:30.208
Before we begin,
I need your permission to administer G-46.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.208
-Drip on?
-Acknowledge.

00:36.833 --> 00:38.958
What was the ghost's favorite fruit?

00:41.916 --> 00:42.875
Boo-berry.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.583
No shit, that's funny.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.708
What did the magician say
to the fisherman?

01:01.458 --> 01:03.291
Pick a cod, any cod.

01:10.666 --> 01:13.083
What do you call
cheese that isn't yours?

01:16.958 --> 01:18.000
Nacho cheese.

01:21.833 --> 01:26.291
All right, Ray, Ray, these next ones
aren't jokes, more just facts, okay?

01:26.375 --> 01:27.375
Oh, yeah?

01:34.833 --> 01:39.958
In the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
over 800,000 people died.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.791
You are serving…

01:50.875 --> 01:53.666
You're serving
four consecutive life sentences

01:53.750 --> 01:56.208
without the possibility of parole.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.958
Ray, thank you.
You're free to cruise, buddy.

04:40.416 --> 04:42.750
<i>Another beautiful morning, friends,</i>

04:42.833 --> 04:44.541
<i>time to rise and really shine.</i>

04:44.625 --> 04:47.791
<i>As volunteers in the Spiderhead</i>
<i>Penitentiary and Research Center…</i>

04:48.916 --> 04:51.208
<i>…you must do your part</i>
<i>and practice the golden rules,</i>

04:51.291 --> 04:55.041
<i>no abuse, physical, verbal, or otherwise</i>
<i>and label your food in the fridge.</i>

04:55.125 --> 04:58.000
<i>Jeff, please report to the dock</i>
<i>for remote field testing.</i>

05:10.541 --> 05:13.083
Okay, Jeff, we have
a new compound for you today.

05:13.833 --> 05:16.208
-Drip on?
-If it's N-31.

05:16.291 --> 05:18.375
Hilarious, N-40. Acknowledge?

05:19.250 --> 05:20.250
Acknowledge.

05:27.166 --> 05:28.875
Yeah, whenever you're ready, Jeff.

05:42.166 --> 05:43.166
It's really nice.

05:44.375 --> 05:47.416
Oh, boy. Okay if we pep up
your language centers, Jeff?

05:47.500 --> 05:48.333
Drip on?

05:48.416 --> 05:50.041
-Sure.
-Acknowledge?

05:50.625 --> 05:53.791
Oh, sorry. Yeah, acknowledge.

06:03.625 --> 06:04.458
Whoa.

06:08.375 --> 06:09.708
Hey, sorry, I'm late.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.166
Party's here.

06:20.083 --> 06:21.833
-Such a creep.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.500
-Where you been?
-Field trip.

06:25.583 --> 06:27.250
Oh, right, your phone call with Emma.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.916
No, uh, drug study.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.541
<i>N-40, I think.</i>

06:32.125 --> 06:34.958
<i>They have everyone</i>
<i>on these field trips but me.</i>

06:35.041 --> 06:35.958
You're still new.

06:36.041 --> 06:39.833
I'm not that new.
You know, I'd love some sunshine.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.166
Can I help you with the…

06:42.250 --> 06:44.333
Nectarines and prosciutto?

06:44.416 --> 06:46.791
What you gonna help with?
I'm done. You're late.

06:46.875 --> 06:47.916
Open up.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Enjoy that. Get it all.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.458
-Yeah.
-It's really good.

06:52.541 --> 06:54.875
-Good, right?
-I hope they keep you on snack.

06:54.958 --> 06:57.583
I always said they wasted
your talents on janitorial.

06:57.666 --> 07:00.500
Don't be too sure about that.
I've got a bit of a scrub fetish.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.875
-Okay.
-Hey…

07:03.458 --> 07:07.083
-Did you notice we kinda--
-Finish each other's sentences?

07:07.666 --> 07:09.541
I was gonna say, need new bowls.

07:14.208 --> 07:15.083
Uh…

07:15.166 --> 07:17.000
So, how was the N-40?

07:22.791 --> 07:24.458
<i>Flowers didn't grow…</i>

07:26.875 --> 07:30.916
They were sculpted. Painted.

07:32.875 --> 07:39.000
I mean, I would tell you about it,
but I'm just coming down off the--

07:39.083 --> 07:40.500
-Verbaluce.
-Yeah.

07:40.583 --> 07:44.208
That tip-of-the-tongue feeling
when you can't find the right word

07:44.291 --> 07:47.125
and you feel like
you'll never find the right word again?

07:47.208 --> 07:48.041
Yeah.

07:49.541 --> 07:51.416
Well, you're cute when you're stupid.

07:53.125 --> 07:56.875
Okay, but it sucks
because today was the day that…

08:00.291 --> 08:03.208
There was something that
I was gonna tell you today, Lizzy.

08:05.041 --> 08:08.625
Okay, well, we got time.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.291
Yes, we do.

08:11.375 --> 08:12.875
All we've got is time.

08:16.375 --> 08:17.458
Okay.

08:17.541 --> 08:18.958
What you know about this?

08:19.041 --> 08:20.458
You know nothing about this.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.166
So, to sum up…

08:35.833 --> 08:36.833
I love it.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.541
It's beautiful.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.708
-Where do you wanna take me?
<i>-Hmm.</i>

09:30.791 --> 09:34.000
What about that island, you know,
the one where they make water?

09:35.916 --> 09:37.000
Fiji?

09:37.083 --> 09:38.083
Fiji.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.500
-I'll take you to Fiji.
-Thank you.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.000
Just need a little money.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.750
Can we go to Mark's?
For his birthday?

09:44.833 --> 09:48.458
It was Tuesday, but he's
a celebrate-all-week motherfucker. Please?

09:48.541 --> 09:49.541
Gotta ask the boss.

09:49.625 --> 09:52.833
<i>You two go have fun.</i>
<i>I'm gonna stay here. Okay?</i>

09:52.916 --> 09:54.875
-Miss you.
-Miss you more.

10:00.833 --> 10:01.833
You cool to drive?

10:03.833 --> 10:04.958
Ice cold.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Whoo!

10:18.500 --> 10:19.708
Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

10:22.750 --> 10:23.750
Jeff!

11:41.916 --> 11:43.458
Sorry, I'm late, Mr. Abnesti.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.750
I'm gonna retire
the day you call me Steve.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.125
Not late at all.

11:49.791 --> 11:51.250
Heather, on the other hand…

11:51.791 --> 11:53.416
Yeah, speak of the devil.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
Sorry.

12:01.583 --> 12:02.958
All right.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.791
Oh, how rude of me.
Jeff, Heather. Heather, Jeff.

12:08.458 --> 12:13.041
For the record, either prior to or during
your incarceration here at Spiderhead,

12:13.125 --> 12:14.500
have you two ever spoken?

12:15.166 --> 12:16.250
-No.
-No.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.250
Ever interacted in any way?

12:19.750 --> 12:21.291
Did I not just say no?

12:21.375 --> 12:22.375
No.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.291
So, what do you think?

12:31.500 --> 12:32.750
Who are you asking?

12:32.833 --> 12:34.833
I'm asking both of you.
Let's start with Jeff.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.791
Yeah, she seems nice.

12:40.666 --> 12:43.541
You like that word, but no,
I mean, how attractive is she?

12:43.625 --> 12:45.500
What, Steve,
you can't see it for yourself?

12:45.583 --> 12:48.125
Can you shut up, please?
I'm asking Jeff. How's she looking?

12:48.208 --> 12:49.833
Come on, man.

12:49.916 --> 12:51.958
-A scale of one to ten?
-Um…

12:52.791 --> 12:55.333
Yeah, she's a seven and a half.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.666
And, Heather?

12:58.708 --> 13:02.416
He's all right. A five on a good day.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.666
-Did you give her Honest-Ease?

13:07.250 --> 13:08.708
No, I would have to ask. You know.

13:08.791 --> 13:10.416
I'm just kind of a bitch.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.500
Oh.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.875
Well, then I would like
to change my vote to an eight.

13:15.916 --> 13:17.583
All right, uh, Jeff, Heather,

13:17.666 --> 13:20.583
can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?

13:21.208 --> 13:22.333
Acknowledge.

13:22.416 --> 13:24.291
-Uh, yeah.
-Heather?

13:24.375 --> 13:26.833
God, she's a pain in the ass.

13:26.916 --> 13:29.375
-Acknowledge.
-Thank you.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.583
Come on, guys.
Words, words, words.

13:46.666 --> 13:49.541
Okay, yeah,
she's starting to look pretty good.

13:50.416 --> 13:51.458
Oh, my…

13:52.500 --> 13:58.000
Yeah, she's…
She's looking really, really good.

14:01.333 --> 14:02.333
Heather?

14:09.166 --> 14:11.541
Uh, same. Yeah.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.750
Okay, pump up the Verbaluce,
let's get 'em talking.

14:21.291 --> 14:22.958
Oh, God, she's so beautiful.

14:24.416 --> 14:26.083
Yeah, don't tell us, tell each other.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.000
You're… Oh, my God.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.875
You're stunning,
you're gorgeous.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.708
Sorry, I didn't see it before.

14:32.791 --> 14:36.833
It's okay, you're the most beautiful woman
I think I've ever seen in my life.

14:36.916 --> 14:37.958
Thank you.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.000
Wow.

14:39.083 --> 14:40.333
-Yeah.
-I could, uh…

14:40.416 --> 14:41.666
-Yeah?
-I could…

14:47.541 --> 14:48.958
You could what, Jeff?

14:59.208 --> 15:00.083
Oh, yeah.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.291
Are we getting this?

15:07.166 --> 15:08.458
-Oh, yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.083
-Oh, my God.

15:26.916 --> 15:27.916
You okay?

15:31.583 --> 15:32.583
Oh.

15:37.916 --> 15:39.833
What's so funny?

15:39.916 --> 15:40.916
Nothing.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.125
I didn't think it was possible.

15:55.583 --> 15:56.583
What?

15:57.416 --> 15:59.541
-I'm liking cuddling.

16:00.416 --> 16:02.791
Please send me home
with some of this shit.

16:02.875 --> 16:03.875
Heather…

16:05.875 --> 16:06.875
Yes?

16:11.916 --> 16:12.916
I love you.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.916
Holy shit.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.041
I love you too.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.791
N-fucking-40, baby.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.666
Yeah, God damn, we're good.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.833
The love drug.

16:24.916 --> 16:25.750
Gold star?

16:25.833 --> 16:27.791
Not yet, not yet. No, no.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.833
We're less interested in
what we just saw than the residual effect.

16:30.916 --> 16:34.333
I realize you're stretched thin,
but I need you to observe these two.

16:35.083 --> 16:38.708
After they come down, in the next hours,
days, do they seek contact?

16:38.791 --> 16:40.916
Profess feelings when
they're in the same room?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.875
Do they communicate non-verbally?
Look for isopraxisms.

16:44.458 --> 16:45.500
Uh, mirrored behaviors.

16:45.583 --> 16:48.000
People in love
unconsciously mimic each other's actions.

16:48.083 --> 16:51.333
They scratch their faces,
fiddle with their hair at the same time.

16:51.416 --> 16:53.291
It's like their bodies
can't help themselves.

16:53.375 --> 16:55.041
So watch Jeff and Heather.

16:55.125 --> 16:57.750
I want to know. I want to know, does love…

16:57.833 --> 16:59.875
Does this love last?

17:01.500 --> 17:04.958
Hey, guys, thank you.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.583
Thank you very much, no kidding.
We couldn't do it without you.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.208
Remember, what you're feeling,

17:09.291 --> 17:11.958
the sometimes
disquieting transitions are natural.

17:12.041 --> 17:14.500
We're bringing you back
to baseline. More to come.

17:17.291 --> 17:18.375
Am I back on snack?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.375
You don't
wanna know, trust me.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.083
Me and the girls at the group home,

17:24.166 --> 17:26.666
we swiped lottery tickets
from convenience stores,

17:26.750 --> 17:28.500
scratched them a hundred at a time.

17:28.583 --> 17:32.208
It looked like we were doing honest work,
you know, dirt under our nails.

17:33.375 --> 17:36.458
It's not like we thought
stealing was bad, right?

17:36.541 --> 17:38.875
No one needed it more than us
'cause we had nothin'.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.083
Yeah.

17:40.166 --> 17:43.625
This one Christmas Eve,
we're drivin' through neighborhoods,

17:43.708 --> 17:44.958
everyone's at church.

17:45.041 --> 17:47.250
We're breaking windows,

17:47.333 --> 17:50.000
stealing presents from
under people's Christmas trees…

17:50.083 --> 17:51.041
Here you go.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.958
Know what happens the next morning?

17:53.041 --> 17:56.250
We're openin' up other people's sweaters,
<i>The Grinch</i> comes on TV.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.208
Man.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.625
That part where
he gives back all the presents?

17:59.708 --> 18:01.125
-I felt so bad.
-Yeah, I bet.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.000
I cried like a little punk-ass.

18:52.041 --> 18:53.583
Afternoon, kids.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.291
Sarah, you know Jeff.
Jeff, you know Sarah.

18:58.916 --> 18:59.916
Hey.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.500
Hey.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.083
As you know,
we're wall-to-wall today.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.916
Boss man's breathing down our neck.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.625
-So, if it's cool--
-Acknowledge.

19:13.791 --> 19:16.708
Yeah, fine. Acknowledge.

19:22.375 --> 19:23.833
I can't watch.

19:23.916 --> 19:25.625
Sarah or the double dose?

19:25.708 --> 19:27.000
Sarah <i>on</i> the double dose.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.375
We're all here by choice, Mark.

19:45.041 --> 19:46.041
Is she…

19:46.791 --> 19:47.833
Yeah, I think so.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.958
-Yes! Yes!

20:01.083 --> 20:02.208
What's up, Ray?

20:02.291 --> 20:05.416
Someone wrote in shit
on the bathroom stall doors, that's what.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.500
Gross.

20:06.833 --> 20:09.916
I'll find out who's shit-finger.
Hope it ain't you.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.500
It's not.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.416
Damn, I will never be as good
at anything as you are with that.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.583
-You like that?
-Yeah.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.708
Hey, is there a drug
to make you forget shit?

20:32.791 --> 20:34.083
Yeah, it's called old age.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.416
I'm looking forward to it.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.041
How you feeling?

20:47.375 --> 20:49.500
I'm all right. A little sore.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.458
It must've felt pretty good
at the time though.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.250
Yeah.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.250
-We can get you some cream for that.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.791
I'm fine. Thanks, though.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.916
Hey, uh, do me a favor.

21:04.958 --> 21:08.375
While we're at it, try not to let
the girls touch your MobiPak.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.541
And don't… And don't touch theirs. Okay?

21:11.625 --> 21:14.958
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,

21:15.041 --> 21:16.208
they can flood.

21:16.291 --> 21:17.625
You could lose control.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.333
Cool.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.583
Uh, hey, Mark?

21:23.666 --> 21:24.875
Yeah?

21:24.958 --> 21:26.416
Can you take me off snack?

21:26.958 --> 21:30.458
Was something wrong? Problems with Lizzy?

21:31.416 --> 21:33.916
Nah, just, I'm ready for a change.

21:36.875 --> 21:39.000
Yeah. Okay.

21:42.291 --> 21:43.291
Thanks, man.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.666
God damn it.

21:59.583 --> 22:00.583
Oh, my God.

22:01.458 --> 22:02.541
Lizzy.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.791
Is she from Seattle?

22:04.333 --> 22:05.958
Prescott, Arizona.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.625
Ah, see? Jeff knows.

22:08.708 --> 22:10.541
It's cool when folks get acquainted.

22:10.625 --> 22:12.750
Speaking of,
I saw the box scores this morning.

22:12.833 --> 22:16.166
You Mariners are on a bit of a streak.
We should pipe in a game later, huh?

22:16.250 --> 22:18.375
Yeah, that'd be great.
Who're they playing?

22:18.458 --> 22:20.625
Crap. Hey, Mark, return this.

22:21.916 --> 22:24.541
Uh, Jeff, please take a seat.
Another full day ahead.

22:25.083 --> 22:27.500
If you could read the headlines,
you can't, but if you could,

22:27.583 --> 22:29.583
the world needs our help more than ever.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.208
Now, we got two rooms running today.

22:33.291 --> 22:35.125
Pay no attention to Dave, trust me.

22:35.208 --> 22:36.583
Seriously, trust him.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.375
Jeff…

22:42.708 --> 22:45.708
All right. Recognize them?

22:47.250 --> 22:48.416
That's very funny.

22:49.208 --> 22:51.958
I'm gonna present you with a choice.
This is what I'm after.

22:52.083 --> 22:53.583
-Mm-hmm.
-You see this remote?

22:54.166 --> 22:59.000
Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx,

22:59.541 --> 23:03.125
or you could slide this button
and Heather gets some Darkenfloxx.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.208
You see? You choose.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.833
-They have Darkenfloxx in their MobiPaks?

23:07.916 --> 23:08.916
Excuse me.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.750
Hey, Dave, how you feeling?

23:20.083 --> 23:21.083
Hungry.

23:22.875 --> 23:25.125
-Could he be shit-finger?
-Yeah, maybe.

23:25.208 --> 23:27.625
All that food's
gotta go somewhere.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.541
Where were we? Darkenfloxx.

23:29.625 --> 23:33.208
Mark put it in the ladies' MobiPaks
in anticipation of this very study.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.458
That make you feel uncomfortable?

23:37.541 --> 23:38.416
A little.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.041
Yeah? That's okay, it should.

23:40.541 --> 23:43.166
But you know as well as I
it's just an agitator,

23:43.250 --> 23:45.166
causes no permanent damage. All right?

23:46.916 --> 23:48.458
So what's your decision, Jeff?

23:48.541 --> 23:51.083
Is Heather getting
the Darkenfloxx or is Sarah?

23:53.250 --> 23:54.583
I don't know, I can't say.

23:55.208 --> 23:58.041
Can't say or won't say?
You kinda have to, you know that.

23:58.625 --> 24:02.083
I mean, it's random if I do.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.125
You feel your decision would be random?

24:04.208 --> 24:05.208
Yeah.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.791
This is what we're testing for…

24:08.875 --> 24:11.500
Is any residual fondness with…
With the ladies.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.875
So why don't you tell me
how you feel about Heather and Sarah?

24:15.750 --> 24:16.875
How I feel?

24:16.958 --> 24:18.041
Maybe some Verbaluce?

24:18.125 --> 24:19.083
No.

24:19.166 --> 24:24.458
I mean, it's not that I like 'em both,
or that I like one more than the other.

24:24.541 --> 24:29.666
It's just, I… I just don't really feel
anything towards either of them, you know?

24:29.750 --> 24:33.750
I mean, I can remember feeling
a certain way towards 'em,

24:33.833 --> 24:36.625
but that's all kind of
hazy and worn off now.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.708
And why such reluctance
to the Darkenfloxx then?

24:40.791 --> 24:42.916
Because I was a part of I-16.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.875
I mean, I know what it's like,
and you know what it's like.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.125
-It's…
-Yeah.

24:50.208 --> 24:51.375
It's… It's horrible.

24:51.458 --> 24:55.041
And I just…
I don't want to do that to anyone.

24:56.416 --> 24:58.291
Look, I don't know. It's random.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.750
Okay. I'll tell you what.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.541
I'm giving
the Darkenfloxx to Heather. Okay?

25:11.791 --> 25:13.833
Actually, I'm gonna give it to Sarah.

25:18.541 --> 25:20.416
All right, Jeff, you've convinced me.

25:20.958 --> 25:23.291
It would to you be random,
you truly have no preference.

25:23.375 --> 25:25.875
My preference is that nobody gets it.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.083
That makes two of us.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.166
Three.

25:28.708 --> 25:30.041
See what we just did.

25:30.125 --> 25:33.083
With your help, we learned
a lot more about N-40.

25:33.166 --> 25:35.583
"Luvactin," working title.

25:35.666 --> 25:38.083
So, no one's getting Darkenfloxx?

25:38.166 --> 25:39.125
Not today.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.541
But we do need
to understand N-40 a bit better.

25:41.625 --> 25:44.333
For instance, uh,
what's the drug's duration?

25:44.416 --> 25:46.625
What's the variable effect
of its dosage?

25:46.708 --> 25:49.458
You and Sarah were on double the dose
of you and Heather

25:49.541 --> 25:52.333
and yet your feelings for the two women
are largely the same.

25:52.416 --> 25:54.041
Don't you find that interesting?

25:55.166 --> 25:56.166
Yeah.

25:58.791 --> 26:02.208
Hey, uh, I, uh… I'm not one to bring
Darkenfloxx in any conversation,

26:03.083 --> 26:06.583
but we have to know more about N-40.
It could be a game-changer, Jeff.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.416
The work we do
could help millions of people.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.083
You ever loved?

26:15.416 --> 26:16.416
Yeah.

26:17.791 --> 26:19.875
Yeah, you were lucky. Not everyone can.

26:21.708 --> 26:25.125
You know that loneliness is as lethal
as smoking 15 cigarettes a day?

26:25.833 --> 26:26.708
Look it up.

26:27.291 --> 26:30.791
Imagine if we could destroy
all the world's cigarettes.

26:31.625 --> 26:35.541
We'd have people everywhere loving,
being loved, capable of love,

26:36.875 --> 26:38.708
and who would've made that possible?

26:39.041 --> 26:40.875
-Gold star for me.
-Yeah.

26:40.958 --> 26:43.500
Yeah. And your new friend, N-40.
Yay for us.

26:43.583 --> 26:44.791
Yay.

26:46.875 --> 26:49.083
Okay. Thank you, ladies.

26:51.625 --> 26:52.625
Excuse you, Jeff.

26:59.250 --> 27:02.041
Hey. Everything okay?

27:02.583 --> 27:03.583
Yeah.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.875
They don't know how close
they came to getting Darkenfloxxed.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.500
Yeah, I know. I get it.

27:10.208 --> 27:13.666
But listen, man, think if you'd had
the benefit of one of our products

27:13.750 --> 27:15.166
before your fateful night…

27:16.500 --> 27:19.791
What is it you want, Jeff,
more than anything in the world?

27:23.333 --> 27:24.208
To go back.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.833
<i>What you want is redemption.</i>

27:51.666 --> 27:53.750
And this is how you're gonna find it.

27:58.750 --> 27:59.750
Yeah, thanks.

28:22.541 --> 28:23.541
Hey.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.166
Hey.

28:25.875 --> 28:26.875
Meatball?

28:28.291 --> 28:29.291
Yeah, sure.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.291
Ah, sorry.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.833
It's all right.
I suck at this game anyway.

28:41.708 --> 28:44.083
-Hey, I wanted to--
-Hey, Jeff.

28:49.666 --> 28:51.166
Ah, Free Fridays.

28:51.958 --> 28:52.958
Lucky.

28:54.708 --> 28:56.208
Say hi to the missus for me.

29:21.083 --> 29:24.375
<i>Hi, it's Emma.</i>
<i>Leave a message or don't.</i>

29:25.375 --> 29:29.583
<i>Hey, babe, you're probably getting</i>
<i>sick of me leaving these things for you,</i>

29:29.666 --> 29:35.500
<i>but I just wanted to tell you</i>
<i>the usual that I miss you and I'm sorry.</i>

29:37.916 --> 29:39.833
<i>Something else I wanna tell you too.</i>

29:39.916 --> 29:44.083
<i>I, uh, met someone.</i>
<i>Yeah, her name's Lizzy.</i>

29:44.791 --> 29:46.875
<i>She kinda reminds me of you a little bit.</i>

29:49.916 --> 29:52.208
<i>So maybe I'll finally stop bugging you.</i>

29:54.375 --> 29:56.208
<i>This'll be my last, "I'm sorry."</i>

30:24.500 --> 30:25.375
Yeah, come in.

30:27.041 --> 30:27.958
Ho, ho, ho!

30:28.958 --> 30:31.500
Merry Christmas, Lizzy.

30:31.583 --> 30:34.041
-Have you been a nice girl?
-This is…

30:34.750 --> 30:35.916
This is Santa?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.500
Hello!

30:38.166 --> 30:40.291
Thought this might cheer us up.

30:40.375 --> 30:41.666
Aww. Wow.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.833
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

30:43.916 --> 30:46.041
-Ew! Ugh!

30:46.125 --> 30:47.125
God.

30:48.041 --> 30:50.166
It's not actually Christmas though, is it?

30:50.666 --> 30:51.916
October?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.916
-Yeah, just a guess.
-Okay.

30:55.083 --> 30:57.125
I'd play "Jingle Bells,"
but we get this instead.

30:57.208 --> 30:59.166
You know what? I'll make some eggnog.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.125
-Mm.
-Yeah?

31:00.208 --> 31:03.666
-Ooh, Santa like eggnog.
-Not the Santa voice.

31:16.750 --> 31:17.750
Hey, Rogan.

31:18.208 --> 31:19.458
Go fuck yourself.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.125
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.375
-No way, guys. Come on.
-Just relax.

31:42.458 --> 31:45.958
We know what it does. Okay?
We've all seen what it does.

31:46.041 --> 31:48.750
It's already proven.
This isn't some type of skin show.

31:48.833 --> 31:49.833
Tell 'em, Rogan.

31:49.916 --> 31:53.333
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
But fuck all y'all.

31:53.416 --> 31:56.750
-He has a future in greeting cards.
-I can fuckin' hear you!

31:56.833 --> 31:59.166
Guys, listen, listen to me, okay?

31:59.250 --> 32:01.000
I've never been with a… Uh…

32:01.083 --> 32:03.583
No offense, man. If you have, that's fine.

32:03.666 --> 32:05.083
It's not my thing. Whatever.

32:05.166 --> 32:07.958
Look, Mark, I'm not recovered, man.

32:08.041 --> 32:11.000
I asked for cream,
nobody brought me cream.

32:11.083 --> 32:12.875
So I'm not doing this. I won't.

32:12.958 --> 32:15.916
No, I'm not. No! No! No! No!

32:16.000 --> 32:18.333
I'm not, I won't. I won't acknowledge.

32:18.416 --> 32:22.333
Jeff, chill pill. It isn't what
you think. No romance novels today.

32:22.416 --> 32:23.416
Huh.

32:24.625 --> 32:25.708
Your loss.

32:27.000 --> 32:27.833
Funny.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.583
That's it, guys. Thanks.

32:42.708 --> 32:44.541
What the fuck was that about?

32:58.208 --> 33:00.666
<i>Ping-pong</i>
<i>tournament set for Saturday.</i>

33:00.750 --> 33:02.583
<i>Please see Ray if you're interested.</i>

33:03.125 --> 33:04.541
-Oh, hi, Jeff.
-Hey, Heather.

33:04.625 --> 33:05.541
It's not the time.

33:05.625 --> 33:09.250
Did Mr. Abnesti ask you
who to Darkenfloxx, me or Rogan?

33:09.333 --> 33:11.708
-He did present me with that dilemma--
-Heather.

33:11.791 --> 33:14.458
Did you recently have sex
with Rogan in addition to me

33:14.541 --> 33:16.875
and fall in love with him
like you did with me?

33:16.958 --> 33:17.791
Jeff, come on.

33:17.875 --> 33:19.833
That's an accurate assessment
of what's going on.

33:19.916 --> 33:21.875
-Heather, put a sock in it.
-Okay.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.291
Jeff, what are you doing?

33:23.375 --> 33:26.666
Now she's looking for her sock.
You get very literal on Verbaluce.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.416
Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.
Show yourself out, close the door.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.625
-Okay.
-Well done.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.958
Please show yourself out, thank you.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.833
-Jesus Christ, Jeff. It's--
-Wow. Yeah.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.083
What's going on, huh?

33:41.166 --> 33:43.958
-So everybody's just fucking everyone?
-Language.

33:44.041 --> 33:45.250
Everyone's fucking everyone.

33:45.333 --> 33:47.583
-Relax.
-And being asked to Darkenfloxx everyone.

33:47.666 --> 33:48.875
It's experimental design.

33:48.958 --> 33:51.416
I don't make the rules,
it's the Protocol Committee.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.791
Why don't you take a look? Look. Here.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.416
Here you go. Huh?

33:56.500 --> 33:58.041
You think I want to do this?

33:58.125 --> 33:59.333
Let me close the door.

33:59.416 --> 34:01.875
Mark, I mean, look, man,

34:01.958 --> 34:04.791
I've been on
some crazy-ass project teams, right?

34:04.875 --> 34:07.666
But this one…
Yeah, this one doesn't feel right.

34:07.750 --> 34:10.916
Jeff, you know,
I sympathize, but only to a point.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.125
I gotta take off my friendship hat
for a second and remind you,

34:14.208 --> 34:15.958
your presence in this facility,

34:16.041 --> 34:19.375
while technically a punishment,
is a privilege. Is it not?

34:19.458 --> 34:21.666
You applied for it,
you were approved for it.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.958
You could as easily be
at State with the general pop

34:24.041 --> 34:25.791
and you would be playing pitch-and-catch,

34:25.875 --> 34:27.666
in your case catch,
with the likes of Rogan.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.875
You don't wanna know
what he did in his last prison.

34:29.958 --> 34:32.916
And secondly,
our open-door policy is my greatest pride.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.958
I can come visit you, you can visit me.

34:35.041 --> 34:37.458
Even in my quarters
or up here in the Spiderhead.

34:37.541 --> 34:41.208
No other penal institution in the world
boasts such a respectful relationship

34:41.291 --> 34:42.958
between the jailer and the jailed.

34:43.041 --> 34:48.083
No bars, no guards, that's only possible
in a culture of mutual respect.

34:48.166 --> 34:51.500
Okay? Mutual respect.
I don't burst in on you, do I?

34:51.583 --> 34:52.583
Huh?

34:53.000 --> 34:53.916
-No.
-No.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.833
So, you don't burst in on me.
We must honor that or it's my ass.

34:59.291 --> 35:00.583
Doors close, locks go on,

35:00.666 --> 35:03.166
suddenly we're no different
from anywhere else, you get it?

35:03.250 --> 35:04.250
Yes.

35:04.791 --> 35:06.875
Jesus, is it all that terrible here?

35:07.458 --> 35:10.666
Huh? I'm asking
'cause I've taken great pains, Jeff.

35:10.750 --> 35:11.666
It's very nice.

35:11.750 --> 35:14.333
The food, the ping-pong, arcade games,

35:14.416 --> 35:16.958
freedom within reason
to move around as you please.

35:17.041 --> 35:18.541
I've insisted on that for you.

35:18.625 --> 35:20.916
I've flirted with violating
state compliance standards,

35:21.000 --> 35:22.625
-at no small risk to me.
-I know.

35:22.708 --> 35:24.333
In front of my bosses, my boss' bosses.

35:24.416 --> 35:25.875
Back me up here, Mark.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.958
-Hmm? Come on, say something.
-He's right.

35:32.416 --> 35:34.916
At least you could
return the sentiment.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.166
It's the least you could do.

35:39.625 --> 35:40.625
I'm sorry.

35:42.666 --> 35:43.791
Okay? I…

35:44.916 --> 35:48.625
It's just, all this talk of Darkenfloxx,
it gets me on edge. Okay?

35:50.916 --> 35:53.083
I hate this, Jeff and I'm sorry. Okay?

35:53.166 --> 35:54.166
I just…

35:55.625 --> 35:58.208
I need to know if we can count on you.

35:58.291 --> 36:01.333
Can we count on you in the future
to honor our arrangement?

36:12.916 --> 36:13.916
Hey, Sarah.

36:19.416 --> 36:22.791
This time, next week, we'll have
our last gold star, don't you think?

36:23.833 --> 36:27.041
Mark, smile once in a while, okay?
We're changing the world.

36:27.541 --> 36:28.541
Yeah.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.166
Not you too.

36:31.375 --> 36:34.333
Listen, Darkenfloxx is a tool, okay?

36:34.416 --> 36:36.875
It's gonna help us figure out
the important shit.

36:36.958 --> 36:40.000
This time, next week,
right back in the drawer, I promise.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.416
Yeah? What?

36:44.375 --> 36:47.708
Well, just something Jeff said
about wanting a drug to forget.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.375
You need to relax, okay?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.166
Enjoy your weekend, Mark.

36:52.791 --> 36:54.541
Hit the mainland, clear your head.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.291
You need it. We both do.

36:56.375 --> 36:59.208
Maybe wings, beer, Skee-Ball,
whatever you kids are into?

36:59.791 --> 37:02.000
Yeah, um… Oh, I think Skee-Ball.

37:02.083 --> 37:03.541
Okay.

37:07.666 --> 37:08.666
Bye, Mark.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.250
Holy fucking shit.

38:35.458 --> 38:38.166
I mean, it's hard to describe
without Verbaluce,

38:38.250 --> 38:44.041
but just imagine
the worst you've ever felt times ten,

38:45.125 --> 38:48.250
and even that doesn't even
come close to it, honestly, I mean…

38:50.000 --> 38:52.041
I felt like I was on fire.

38:53.541 --> 38:55.416
I wished I was on fire.

38:57.375 --> 39:01.166
I would have set myself on fire
to make it stop. It's horrible.

39:01.250 --> 39:03.375
So they give this Darkenfloxx to someone?

39:04.166 --> 39:05.958
I mean, not this time.

39:06.041 --> 39:07.458
Well, that's good.

39:08.791 --> 39:10.583
Jesus, you're shaking.

39:17.041 --> 39:18.041
You're a good guy.

39:27.041 --> 39:31.416
Look, I heard from Mark
that you asked to be taken off snack.

39:33.125 --> 39:35.708
I assume that meant away from me, right?

39:37.291 --> 39:38.375
It's 'cause of, uh…

39:38.958 --> 39:39.958
Emma?

39:40.458 --> 39:41.458
Yeah.

39:42.041 --> 39:43.291
No, she's…

39:45.166 --> 39:46.500
She's moved on.

39:49.625 --> 39:51.583
It just helps to hear her voice sometimes.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.541
Yeah, I know.
Of course, I get it, you know.

39:59.666 --> 40:01.791
This place can really mess with your head.

40:03.791 --> 40:09.166
I mean, they've been testing me up
and down a lot weirder stuff than usual.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.625
It's just been really tough lately.

40:17.708 --> 40:21.041
Sometimes, it's hard to remember
who I was before I came in here.

40:26.333 --> 40:27.583
But, Lizzy…

40:31.041 --> 40:32.250
When I'm with you…

40:34.458 --> 40:37.083
that's the only time
I really feel like myself.

40:46.333 --> 40:48.666
Hands up, Mark. Come on.
There you go.

40:49.166 --> 40:51.500
-So, I had a big idea for G-46.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.000
Oh, yeah? What, Laffodil?

40:53.083 --> 40:55.250
Yes, uh, we sell it to comedy clubs.

40:56.041 --> 40:59.208
That's a little idea, Mark. No offense.

40:59.750 --> 41:00.875
Offense kind of taken.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.416
Whoo-hoo!

41:04.041 --> 41:05.750
What do I keep saying to you, huh?

41:05.833 --> 41:07.125
I don't know, "Shut up, Mark"?

41:07.208 --> 41:09.166
I say you gotta think huge.

41:09.250 --> 41:12.041
You look at the world through
the wrong end of binoculars.

41:12.125 --> 41:14.208
That's weird. Don't be weird.

41:14.875 --> 41:16.708
Hey, uh, what time do we start?

41:16.791 --> 41:17.791
Ten minutes.

41:18.833 --> 41:20.875
Why don't you hit me? We got time.

41:20.958 --> 41:23.833
Come on, hit me. Let's go.

41:27.333 --> 41:29.500
-Two?
-Uh, make it three.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.041
Remember, at least 12 hours apart.

41:33.750 --> 41:36.125
Yeah, I've heard the dosing schedule.
Thank you.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.333
Say it. Come on,
you've been wanting to for a while.

41:41.416 --> 41:42.416
Best shot.

41:43.875 --> 41:44.958
You of all people--

41:45.041 --> 41:46.625
Should understand the risks?

41:46.708 --> 41:48.000
That's what I'm trying to do.

41:48.083 --> 41:50.708
-We can assess risks without taking them.
-Oh, can I?

41:50.791 --> 41:52.791
Someone has to answer
for our products, Mark.

41:52.875 --> 41:54.208
Doesn't that occur to you?

41:54.291 --> 41:57.291
Life out there is not life in here, okay?
Shit is messy.

41:57.375 --> 42:00.375
It's out of our control.
This is new frontier stuff here.

42:00.958 --> 42:04.625
And when, not if, when one of
our compounds falls on its face,

42:04.708 --> 42:07.458
one of us has to stand
in front of a bereaved loved one,

42:07.541 --> 42:10.666
or Mike Wallace, or God forbid, a jury,
and answer for what we do.

42:10.750 --> 42:13.083
What we made and bottled
and named and sold.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.250
Is that gonna be you?

42:14.333 --> 42:15.958
No, it's gonna be the guy who can say,

42:16.041 --> 42:18.750
"You're right I stand behind our shit.
I've taken it myself."

42:21.041 --> 42:22.166
Mike Wallace is dead.

42:22.250 --> 42:24.666
Really? Hard to keep track.
Ed Bradley then.

42:24.750 --> 42:25.750
Also dead.

42:26.250 --> 42:27.291
Morley Safer?

42:29.500 --> 42:32.708
Shit. Better to think someone's dead,
and find out they're alive.

42:33.958 --> 42:35.541
Yeah, when you first hired me--

42:35.625 --> 42:37.583
Yeah, you disapproved. Duly noted.

42:37.666 --> 42:40.541
Hey, Jeff, how are you?

42:41.583 --> 42:43.166
-Hey.
-Sorry, I didn't mean to…

42:43.250 --> 42:46.166
That's cool.
Maybe a bit of advance notice next time.

42:46.250 --> 42:47.250
Sure.

42:47.750 --> 42:48.916
Yeah, shall we?

42:49.000 --> 42:51.250
Nobel Prize ain't gonna
win itself.

42:51.875 --> 42:53.041
Mark?

42:53.125 --> 42:55.333
I'm gonna freshen up,
so be down in a second.

43:03.833 --> 43:04.833
Shit.

43:09.750 --> 43:11.916
-Is Heather…
-On her way.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.625
Beautiful people get away with too much.

43:15.708 --> 43:18.375
I say that having
benefited myself from time to time.

43:21.625 --> 43:24.125
Heather, thanks for joining us.
Be right with you.

43:25.250 --> 43:29.583
All right, uh, Jeff,
I want to start by apologizing.

43:29.666 --> 43:32.041
No, look,
I shouldn't have walked in on you.

43:32.125 --> 43:33.458
Oh. No, not that. Uh…

43:34.000 --> 43:35.958
Remember the other day when I asked you

43:36.041 --> 43:38.375
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to
and you said neither?

43:39.416 --> 43:40.250
Yeah.

43:40.333 --> 43:43.750
That was good enough for me,
but apparently not the Protocol Committee.

43:43.833 --> 43:45.875
-Mm-hmm.
-Three Horsemen of Anality.

43:45.958 --> 43:48.250
They're not convinced
you don't have residual feelings

43:48.333 --> 43:49.750
for Heather and Sarah.

43:49.833 --> 43:54.125
So, unfortunately today we gotta do
a kind of a confirmation trial.

43:54.208 --> 43:56.625
This time per
the Protocol Committee, Mark,

43:56.708 --> 43:59.916
uh, instead of me asking you
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to,

44:00.000 --> 44:04.375
which the Protcom felt was,
they say, "too subjective,"

44:04.458 --> 44:08.083
we're gonna give the girl
the Darkenfloxx and then see what you say.

44:08.166 --> 44:10.125
Once again on some Verbaluce.

44:10.666 --> 44:12.666
You refreshed his MobiPak?
His quantities good?

44:12.750 --> 44:16.041
They are. Plus
I already told you they are.

44:16.125 --> 44:17.375
And what about Heather's?

44:17.458 --> 44:19.833
You stood right there
and watched me, Steve.

44:21.375 --> 44:22.708
That I did, Mark.

44:25.458 --> 44:27.125
Sorry, Jeff, we're a little tense today.

44:28.250 --> 44:31.291
Not an easy day and everyone's
a little bit uncomfortable about this.

44:31.375 --> 44:33.416
I don't want you to Darkenfloxx Heather.

44:33.958 --> 44:34.833
Okay, good start.

44:34.916 --> 44:39.125
Uh, is that because you love her?
Feelings of love?

44:39.208 --> 44:41.208
No, I mean, I already told you that.

44:41.291 --> 44:42.458
Yeah, uh, and I agreed,

44:42.541 --> 44:46.166
but is this confirmation trial
about what you and I want?

44:46.250 --> 44:47.083
Not so much.

44:47.166 --> 44:50.333
What it is about
is about us recording what you say

44:50.416 --> 44:52.458
as you observe
Heather getting Darkenfloxxed

44:52.541 --> 44:53.791
for five minutes, that's all.

44:53.875 --> 44:55.666
One five-minute trial. Okay?

44:55.750 --> 44:58.541
So, here we go with the Verbaluce.

44:58.625 --> 45:00.083
Drip on, Jeff?

45:03.291 --> 45:04.416
Oh, come on, Jeff.

45:04.500 --> 45:06.416
You should be flattered.
Did we choose Rogan?

45:07.166 --> 45:08.333
You're afraid of Rogan.

45:08.416 --> 45:11.083
Yeah, Rogan could kill you
with a box of Kleenex.

45:11.166 --> 45:15.500
But no, we deemed your level of speaking
more commensurate with our data needs.

45:15.583 --> 45:16.583
Drip on?

45:21.083 --> 45:23.083
God, did you even know Heather's story?

45:23.166 --> 45:24.666
You don't. Legally, you can't.

45:24.750 --> 45:27.958
But does it involve whiskey,
gangs, patricide? I can't say.

45:28.041 --> 45:31.958
But can I imply that her past
did not exactly include a dog named Lassie

45:32.041 --> 45:35.041
and a lot of family talks about the Bible
while grammy sat doing macramé?

45:35.125 --> 45:37.583
Can I suggest if… Mark, empty.

45:38.250 --> 45:40.458
Can I suggest if you knew Heather's past,

45:40.541 --> 45:44.583
making her feel briefly sad,
nauseous, and/or horrified,

45:44.666 --> 45:47.166
it might not seem like
the worst idea in the world?

45:49.625 --> 45:50.666
I don't know.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.208
Am I a monster, Jeff?

45:53.833 --> 45:55.666
Do I remember birthdays around here?

45:55.750 --> 45:57.666
Who took you up
in his seaplane that one time?

45:57.750 --> 45:59.125
-You.
-Yeah. And when we had

45:59.208 --> 46:02.291
that outbreak of athlete's foot,
and your feet were rashed up,

46:02.375 --> 46:05.000
did a certain individual
rush to pick up a prescription,

46:05.083 --> 46:07.583
paying for it with his own personal money?

46:07.666 --> 46:09.000
-That was nice.
-Yeah.

46:09.083 --> 46:10.958
Seems unprofessional to bring up now.

46:11.041 --> 46:13.375
Come on, Jeff,
what do you want me to say here?

46:13.458 --> 46:15.541
Huh? Your Free Fridays are at risk?

46:16.041 --> 46:18.125
Look,
I'm trying to help, Mr. Abnesti.

46:18.208 --> 46:19.208
Steve!

46:23.666 --> 46:26.458
Can you make a call for me?

46:34.250 --> 46:35.333
Yeah, all right.

46:37.250 --> 46:41.000
Let me give it a shot. Okay? BRB.

46:50.041 --> 46:50.916
Lizzy.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.166
Uh, Mr. Abnesti.

46:52.250 --> 46:54.208
-My father in the room?
-Huh?

46:54.291 --> 46:56.333
Who am I kidding?
He split when I was eight.

46:57.250 --> 46:59.041
Shit, man. I'm sorry.

46:59.541 --> 47:01.291
We're so happy to have you, Lizzy,

47:01.916 --> 47:04.416
and not just 'cause of
your culinary skills.

47:04.500 --> 47:08.541
You won best brisket
at the Prescott Barbecue Festival,

47:08.625 --> 47:09.625
three years running?

47:09.708 --> 47:10.833
How did you know that?

47:10.916 --> 47:12.750
-It's my business to know.
-Wow.

47:13.333 --> 47:14.208
You know, myself,

47:14.291 --> 47:16.791
-I find brisket a little bit fibrous, but…
-Hmm.

47:18.125 --> 47:19.000
Okay.

47:20.250 --> 47:22.708
Did we snag you
those copper pots you're after?

47:23.958 --> 47:25.541
I've been meaning to thank you.

47:25.625 --> 47:27.583
Stop it, stop it, unnecessary.

47:27.666 --> 47:29.666
You've been such a welcome addition.

47:29.750 --> 47:31.750
-It's the least I could do.
-Thank you.

47:33.166 --> 47:34.166
Mm.

47:35.291 --> 47:37.291
In fact, you know, you made me feel, uh…

47:38.333 --> 47:40.125
Made me feel a little bit foolish.

47:40.916 --> 47:42.333
-Foolish?
-Yeah.

47:42.416 --> 47:44.041
Just, you get someone's file

47:44.125 --> 47:47.333
and, uh, you form these preconceptions,
even when you know

47:47.416 --> 47:50.083
there were plenty of circumstances
and not so many fair shakes.

47:50.666 --> 47:51.708
You still judge.

47:54.541 --> 47:55.541
Hmm.

47:57.791 --> 48:00.958
Anyone else here, um, know?

48:01.875 --> 48:04.166
Oh, no. Our little secret.

48:05.541 --> 48:06.541
Yeah.

48:09.666 --> 48:10.500
Whoo!

48:10.583 --> 48:14.416
This is good. A thousand copper pots
for Java like this.

48:14.500 --> 48:17.666
Or maybe a field trip?
An Arizona girl-in-the-sunshine, huh?

48:25.541 --> 48:27.083
Hi, Jeff. Uh…

48:29.208 --> 48:30.333
I'm sorry, man.

48:30.958 --> 48:33.666
Unfortunately, the committee
was very firm.

48:33.750 --> 48:37.125
They insisted the test must be
continued as scheduled.

48:37.208 --> 48:40.291
Otherwise, they're threatening
to remove you from this program

48:40.375 --> 48:41.791
and send you back to State.

48:43.833 --> 48:46.916
They need you to acknowledge, Jeff.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.541
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
one last time. Drip on?

49:01.000 --> 49:02.541
Yeah, acknowledge.

49:04.208 --> 49:05.208
Thank you.

49:12.458 --> 49:13.916
Heather, hello again.

49:14.625 --> 49:16.666
Good morning, again.

49:16.750 --> 49:17.750
Drip on?

49:19.708 --> 49:20.708
Acknowledge.

49:21.583 --> 49:22.583
Okay, Mark.

49:40.833 --> 49:41.875
I don't like this.

49:46.833 --> 49:48.416
Please. It's hurting.

49:51.208 --> 49:52.583
What's wrong with me?

49:52.666 --> 49:55.125
-It can't hurt you.
-Shit.

49:56.125 --> 49:59.500
Jeff, speak a lot, in detail.
Let's make something useful with this.

50:05.583 --> 50:06.791
Heather just vomited.

50:06.875 --> 50:08.791
She appears to be
in a highly aversive state.

50:08.875 --> 50:11.583
Why don't you back us up?
What happened first?

50:11.666 --> 50:12.916
She started to cry.

50:14.583 --> 50:16.625
She seems confused by how she's feeling.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.541
Now she's crying harder.
She seems unable to sit still.

50:21.625 --> 50:22.875
And what are you feeling?

50:25.958 --> 50:28.666
-Melancholy. Culpability.
-Oh, no, please.

50:28.750 --> 50:30.000
Mm-hmm.

50:30.083 --> 50:31.083
Go on.

50:31.416 --> 50:33.333
No, no, no.

50:33.416 --> 50:35.583
All I can think
is Heather was once a child.

50:36.666 --> 50:39.083
-Loved by her mother and father…

50:40.000 --> 50:43.083
…neither foreseeing that
one day she might do a terrible thing.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.458
A thing that would separate her
once and for all from love.

50:47.541 --> 50:49.041
Good, go on.

50:49.125 --> 50:52.916
Divorce her from joy
and cause her unspeakable sadness.

50:57.416 --> 50:58.958
And do you love her?

51:01.541 --> 51:03.708
Help! Please! Please!

51:05.958 --> 51:06.958
No.

51:11.041 --> 51:12.250
Hang in there, Jeff.

51:12.333 --> 51:14.208
Hey, Mark. Any vestige of romantic love

51:14.291 --> 51:16.041
-in Jeff's words?

51:16.125 --> 51:17.208
-No.
-Great.

51:17.291 --> 51:19.958
-Just basic human feeling.

51:20.041 --> 51:21.083
Excellent.

51:21.166 --> 51:22.166
-Steve.

51:22.250 --> 51:24.375
-Mm?
-I think it's flooding.

51:24.458 --> 51:25.458
Get back!

51:25.541 --> 51:26.375
Back off.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.791
-I did. The effects not--

51:28.875 --> 51:29.958
Try more red.

51:31.041 --> 51:32.666
Heather is in great torment.

51:32.750 --> 51:35.083
-Back it off.
-It's not working.

51:35.166 --> 51:38.958
Heather, listen to me. Sit down,
don't raise a finger, that's an order.

51:39.041 --> 51:40.375
Get away from me, please!

51:40.458 --> 51:42.458
-Are you kidding me?

51:42.541 --> 51:44.083
Are you fucking kidding me?

51:44.583 --> 51:45.583
Jesus.

51:45.666 --> 51:47.041
This is bad. Get in there, go.

51:48.833 --> 51:49.666
Shit.

51:49.750 --> 51:51.875
Heather's destroying everything
within reach.

51:51.958 --> 51:53.041
Sit down.
That is an order.

51:53.958 --> 51:55.208
I'm responsible.

51:55.916 --> 51:57.708
Stay the fuck away from me!

51:57.791 --> 51:58.625
I facilitated--

51:58.708 --> 52:02.083
Heather, listen to me, deep breaths,
everything's gonna be fine, okay?

52:02.166 --> 52:03.166
Just relax.

52:12.458 --> 52:13.416
Heather!

52:23.541 --> 52:24.625
Oh, shit.

52:26.500 --> 52:27.750
Oh, shit.

52:28.833 --> 52:33.958
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:35.375 --> 52:37.375
Oh, my God.

52:41.750 --> 52:42.791
Oh, shit!

52:44.291 --> 52:45.583
Oh, my God.

52:48.166 --> 52:49.416
Oh, shit.

52:50.375 --> 52:51.791
God damn it, Mark.

52:55.458 --> 52:56.708
I don't feel a pulse.

52:56.791 --> 52:59.291
What is wrong with you?
I told you to back it off.

52:59.375 --> 53:02.041
What? What?
What? I… I did back it off.

53:02.125 --> 53:04.500
-Forget your…
-I told you this would happen.

53:04.583 --> 53:06.791
She did not respond
to my direct order.

53:06.875 --> 53:08.083
You're talking shit.

53:08.166 --> 53:12.083
You are afraid to commit…
I told you every time, don't hesitate!

53:12.166 --> 53:14.208
I give an instruction, do what I say!

53:15.958 --> 53:17.750
"Abnesti Pharmaceuticals"?

53:17.833 --> 53:19.500
Steve, I warned you.

53:19.583 --> 53:21.333
-You did not.
-This is his company.

53:21.416 --> 53:23.208
-I told you.
-Do not blame me!

53:23.291 --> 53:25.791
You did not listen, I told you.
This is your fault.

53:25.875 --> 53:27.333
I told you. I told you.

53:27.416 --> 53:30.750
-Give me…
-You remember that?

53:32.583 --> 53:33.583
"Bingo"?

53:34.583 --> 53:36.083
You think I have one job?

53:39.250 --> 53:40.625
N-40.

53:40.708 --> 53:43.083
Can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?

53:43.166 --> 53:44.416
Acknowledge.

53:50.125 --> 53:51.500
You see this remote?

53:51.583 --> 53:55.416
Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx.

53:56.041 --> 53:57.041
I-16.

53:59.541 --> 54:00.541
What the hell?

54:06.250 --> 54:08.416
-Where are you going?
-Shut up, Mark.

54:11.791 --> 54:13.083
B-6.

54:14.041 --> 54:17.041
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,

54:17.125 --> 54:18.250
they can flood.

55:13.125 --> 55:14.208
It's not your fault.

55:16.541 --> 55:17.583
Not your fault.

55:58.708 --> 56:01.333
This has gone too far.
We need to report this.

56:01.416 --> 56:04.458
Grow up. You shouldn't act like
we've crossed some sort of line here.

56:04.541 --> 56:08.666
The time to worry about crossing lines
was a lot of lines ago.

56:10.500 --> 56:12.875
If anyone finds out
what happened to Heather,

56:12.958 --> 56:14.625
they'll shut us down, Mark.

56:15.250 --> 56:17.041
Everything I've accomplished will be lost,

56:17.125 --> 56:19.208
and don't think
they'll just come after me.

56:19.291 --> 56:20.625
You'll go down too.

56:22.125 --> 56:23.375
Yeah.

56:27.833 --> 56:28.833
Hey.

56:31.291 --> 56:32.291
I'm sorry.

56:34.416 --> 56:35.833
Okay, this was awful.

56:36.500 --> 56:38.791
But what do I always tell you? Hmm?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.291
Pressure forms diamonds.

56:43.250 --> 56:44.250
Yeah.

56:45.583 --> 56:47.833
This is fine, okay?

56:47.916 --> 56:50.166
You and I,
we're gonna redouble our efforts.

56:50.250 --> 56:54.291
<i>We're gonna gold star B-6,</i>
<i>and we'll change the world, Mark.</i>

56:55.583 --> 57:00.291
<i>And Heather?</i>
<i>Heather died for the best of causes, okay?</i>

57:02.750 --> 57:03.750
Okay.

57:04.666 --> 57:05.833
"Okay" okay?

57:07.166 --> 57:08.000
-Okay.
-Yeah?

57:08.083 --> 57:09.833
-Okay.
-Yeah? Sure? Huh?

57:09.916 --> 57:11.583
Come on, there you are.

57:12.125 --> 57:13.875
Hey, just go take some time, relax.

57:13.958 --> 57:17.125
Whatever helps you forget,
get out of here, go on.

57:29.958 --> 57:30.958
Damn it.

57:46.041 --> 57:47.041
Is she dead?

57:52.375 --> 57:53.583
She's not the best.

57:56.500 --> 57:59.750
That's not fair. Yeah. Yes, she's gone.

58:06.666 --> 58:09.125
This, uh… You know, this is science, Jeff.

58:09.875 --> 58:14.416
And in science,
we have to explore the unknown.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.958
The unknown can lead to the unforeseen,

58:17.041 --> 58:19.375
-and we had no way of predicting that--
-I get it.

58:21.333 --> 58:24.125
Uh, your tone
of voice there, Jeff,

58:25.458 --> 58:27.083
which I perfectly understand.

58:27.166 --> 58:30.666
But be fair. You think
what happened today, you think I liked it?

58:31.500 --> 58:34.291
I didn't. I'm a person too, you know, I…

58:35.500 --> 58:40.041
I have feelings, and no one
is more broken up about this than me.

58:41.791 --> 58:45.458
But in the long run,
our work will help ease suffering,

58:45.541 --> 58:48.375
it'll save lives,
not just one life, many lives.

58:49.583 --> 58:51.500
We're making the world a better place.

58:54.250 --> 58:55.083
Are we?

58:55.166 --> 58:56.416
Yes, Jeff, we are.

58:57.583 --> 58:58.583
You should be proud.

58:59.750 --> 59:02.250
Personal sadness aside,
you did terrific in there.

59:02.333 --> 59:04.958
We all did terrific. Heather, especially.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.041
Right up into the point where she…

59:09.291 --> 59:11.458
You know, it wasn't her finest moment,

59:11.541 --> 59:13.625
but everything prior to that,
she was doing great

59:13.708 --> 59:15.750
and she'll never be forgotten.

59:20.333 --> 59:21.333
What?

59:21.875 --> 59:22.875
It's just tough.

59:27.166 --> 59:28.166
Yeah.

59:30.708 --> 59:33.041
Can I get you something
for how you're feeling?

59:44.583 --> 59:48.208
I swear,
G-46 is good shit, right?

59:48.291 --> 59:49.125
Yeah.

59:49.208 --> 59:52.458
Maybe not change-the-world shit,
but it's good shit.

59:52.541 --> 59:55.375
It's definitely good shit.

59:55.958 --> 59:58.916
It's hard to have
even one sad thought on this stuff.

1:00:00.875 --> 1:00:02.291
What's your worst memory?

1:00:02.875 --> 1:00:03.875
What?

1:00:03.958 --> 1:00:06.541
I'm sorry, that's a stupid question.

1:00:10.291 --> 1:00:14.250
Mine, uh… Mine was… I was…

1:00:14.333 --> 1:00:15.541
I was eight years old

1:00:16.583 --> 1:00:20.791
and, uh, my dad told me
he was gonna take me to summer camp.

1:00:20.875 --> 1:00:22.291
I was so excited.

1:00:22.375 --> 1:00:26.666
And he dropped me off,
and it turns out it wasn't summer camp,

1:00:26.750 --> 1:00:28.208
it was foster care…

1:00:29.708 --> 1:00:31.250
…and I never saw him again.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.833
Oh, my God.

1:00:34.750 --> 1:00:35.833
I'm laughing too.

1:00:36.708 --> 1:00:38.416
That's just so terrible, man.

1:00:39.041 --> 1:00:42.333
It seems funny. Try it.

1:00:42.416 --> 1:00:43.708
He never came back.

1:00:43.791 --> 1:00:47.625
He never came back.
Not even for a weekend.

1:00:48.333 --> 1:00:50.208
I'm actually sorry to hear that, man.

1:00:51.458 --> 1:00:52.291
Damn.

1:00:52.375 --> 1:00:53.791
Oh, the dose is too strong.

1:00:56.958 --> 1:00:58.500
God.

1:00:59.375 --> 1:01:00.833
Man, look at us, huh?

1:01:02.166 --> 1:01:03.375
Jeff and Steve.

1:01:03.916 --> 1:01:05.750
Steve and Jeff hanging out.

1:01:06.416 --> 1:01:07.500
Friends.

1:01:07.583 --> 1:01:08.750
Ehh…

1:01:08.875 --> 1:01:10.166
-What?

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:12.541
Come on, we're up here together.

1:01:12.625 --> 1:01:15.041
Enjoying the view.
That's a friendly thing to do.

1:01:15.125 --> 1:01:16.875
You can… Well…

1:01:17.958 --> 1:01:22.958
You can walk out that door
anytime you want.

1:01:23.916 --> 1:01:24.916
I can't.

1:01:25.791 --> 1:01:28.250
No, I can't. Not anymore.

1:01:33.125 --> 1:01:34.166
What's stopping you?

1:01:36.791 --> 1:01:41.500
The same thing that's stopping you
and every decision I've ever made.

1:01:41.583 --> 1:01:45.333
The ones that led me here to this place.

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:48.625
This is my one true love, Jeff.

1:01:49.666 --> 1:01:52.666
And once you fall in love,
it's hard to fall back out.

1:01:56.750 --> 1:01:57.750
Okay.

1:02:00.666 --> 1:02:04.791
Jeff and Steve… stuck at summer camp.

1:02:08.791 --> 1:02:10.708
To Jeff and Steve. Not that different.

1:02:26.791 --> 1:02:28.833
Get that fucking thing away from me!

1:02:28.916 --> 1:02:31.958
Lizzy, listen. Deep breaths.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:02:32.041 --> 1:02:32.916
Please!

1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.041
For the record, can you tell us
what you're so afraid of?

1:02:36.125 --> 1:02:37.666
<i>Get it the fuck away!</i>

1:02:37.750 --> 1:02:39.375
The Verbaluce isn't doing shit.

1:02:40.208 --> 1:02:41.666
Yeah.

1:02:42.375 --> 1:02:43.625
This one's a goodie.

1:02:46.291 --> 1:02:47.166
Phobica.

1:02:47.250 --> 1:02:48.708
Please stop it! Please stop!

1:02:48.791 --> 1:02:51.416
Make people afraid of things
that are bad for them.

1:02:51.500 --> 1:02:52.500
What, like gluten?

1:02:52.583 --> 1:02:54.250
Yeah. Or thinking too much.

1:03:02.083 --> 1:03:04.541
Please, get that fucking thing
away from me!

1:03:05.833 --> 1:03:07.708
I'm worried about
post-traumatic stress.

1:03:07.791 --> 1:03:09.083
From the stapler?

1:03:09.666 --> 1:03:12.500
Hey, Lizzy? Lizzy, it's just a stapler.

1:03:12.583 --> 1:03:13.750
Just get away now!

1:03:13.833 --> 1:03:15.375
What, should we pack it in?

1:03:17.708 --> 1:03:19.375
Steve, should we pack it in?

1:03:20.791 --> 1:03:22.500
-Yeah, okay.

1:03:28.708 --> 1:03:31.333
The worst one yet. By far.

1:03:33.708 --> 1:03:34.916
How do you feel now?

1:03:37.916 --> 1:03:40.458
Not afraid. Just, uh…

1:03:40.541 --> 1:03:41.583
Ashamed?

1:03:44.458 --> 1:03:45.791
Yeah, I hate that feeling.

1:03:49.291 --> 1:03:51.375
I couldn't stand
feeling that way in front of you.

1:03:51.458 --> 1:03:53.250
That's why I asked to be off snack.

1:04:02.833 --> 1:04:04.916
You know, all the years I spent at State.

1:04:06.041 --> 1:04:07.666
I come here, and I'm, like…

1:04:08.375 --> 1:04:10.833
Is this place even really so much better?

1:04:10.916 --> 1:04:11.916
Hmm.

1:04:12.666 --> 1:04:14.500
I mean, I'd take some beatdowns.

1:04:15.125 --> 1:04:17.833
Instead of having a fear
of a goddamn stapler.

1:04:20.416 --> 1:04:22.541
Why do we keep saying yes?

1:04:23.125 --> 1:04:26.416
Acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge.

1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:30.083
And for what? A private hall pass?

1:04:30.166 --> 1:04:33.708
A bedroom to ourselves?
Copper freakin' pots? I mean…

1:04:40.416 --> 1:04:43.791
All the times you've said yes,
why did you?

1:04:49.458 --> 1:04:51.833
I guess I felt like I deserved it.

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.416
That's what I've been
meaning to tell you, Lizzy.

1:05:02.708 --> 1:05:05.083
<i>Yeah. I think I might go with them.</i>

1:05:07.208 --> 1:05:08.416
Hey.

1:05:11.708 --> 1:05:13.833
Hey. Wait up.

1:05:13.916 --> 1:05:16.416
-She can't live without me.

1:05:25.291 --> 1:05:26.291
You cool to drive?

1:05:26.916 --> 1:05:27.958
Ice cold.

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:32.500
Whoo!

1:05:55.375 --> 1:05:56.416
Whoo!

1:06:11.041 --> 1:06:12.666
Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

1:06:14.250 --> 1:06:15.625
-Jeff!

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.500
Emma. Come on, baby. Come on.

1:06:43.291 --> 1:06:46.041
Emma! Come on, baby. Come on.

1:06:58.250 --> 1:07:00.166
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

1:07:00.250 --> 1:07:03.500
<i>I know you're probably getting sick of me</i>
<i>leaving these things for you,</i>

1:07:03.583 --> 1:07:08.000
<i>but I just wanted to tell you</i>
<i>the usual that I miss you…</i>

1:07:09.625 --> 1:07:13.541
<i>-and I'm sorry.</i>

1:07:13.625 --> 1:07:15.916
<i>The mailbox</i>
<i>for this customer is full.</i>

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.666
<i>It cannot receive</i>
<i>any more messages at this time.</i>

1:07:25.333 --> 1:07:26.958
I'm so sorry.

1:07:31.208 --> 1:07:33.333
Two counts, voluntary manslaughter.

1:07:35.833 --> 1:07:37.708
And that doesn't include Heather.

1:07:39.250 --> 1:07:40.916
Don't do that to yourself.

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:42.875
That's not on you.

1:07:44.416 --> 1:07:46.125
You did everything you could.

1:07:46.208 --> 1:07:47.208
No.

1:07:48.458 --> 1:07:49.875
I said "acknowledge."

1:07:51.916 --> 1:07:53.500
And I don't even know why.

1:08:00.291 --> 1:08:01.666
You're a good soul.

1:08:40.791 --> 1:08:43.750
-We're bad. We're very bad.

1:08:48.875 --> 1:08:52.333
For what it's worth, I think
we're the least of all evils in here.

1:08:53.583 --> 1:08:55.125
Yeah? What makes you say that?

1:08:56.375 --> 1:08:57.500
You hear things.

1:08:57.583 --> 1:08:58.958
Oh, you hear things?

1:08:59.041 --> 1:09:00.750
Yeah. You know Ray?

1:09:00.833 --> 1:09:01.833
Mm-hmm.

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.125
So, after four times in jail for drugs,
Ray went to rehab

1:09:07.208 --> 1:09:09.791
and then to what they call
a rehab refresh,

1:09:09.875 --> 1:09:13.583
which is basically for people
who are so immune to rehab,

1:09:13.666 --> 1:09:15.375
-it stops working.
-Hmm.

1:09:15.458 --> 1:09:20.291
But he must have been immune to that too,
because then came his biggie.

1:09:21.041 --> 1:09:22.458
Triple murder.

1:09:23.958 --> 1:09:30.166
Yeah, his dealer, the dealer's sister,
and the dealer's sister's boyfriend.

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.083
Shit, man.

1:09:36.416 --> 1:09:37.416
You know Rogan?

1:09:38.416 --> 1:09:40.041
-Big diesel Rogan. Hell, yeah.
-Yeah.

1:09:40.125 --> 1:09:42.541
-Who doesn't know Rogan?
-He came home.

1:09:42.625 --> 1:09:47.125
Found his girlfriend cheating on him
and threw her out an eight-story window.

1:09:47.208 --> 1:09:48.416
Oh, shit.

1:09:49.916 --> 1:09:51.041
She did not survive.

1:09:53.333 --> 1:09:54.375
Crazy.

1:09:54.458 --> 1:09:55.750
Yeah, I don't get it.

1:09:55.833 --> 1:09:59.000
-Like, how's it possible, man?
-What?

1:10:00.125 --> 1:10:02.166
If we're all so bad, where's the bad?

1:10:04.416 --> 1:10:05.875
You guys are up late.

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:08.333
Yeah.

1:10:09.625 --> 1:10:10.666
Cheat day.

1:10:11.500 --> 1:10:16.125
Oh, Jeff, we may wanna reconsider
the community snack bowl, given, uh…

1:10:16.208 --> 1:10:17.166
Shit-finger.

1:10:17.250 --> 1:10:19.916
Yeah. Have a wonderful evening.

1:10:20.916 --> 1:10:22.166
-And you.
-And you.

1:11:02.916 --> 1:11:03.916
Bingo.

1:11:35.333 --> 1:11:36.166
Yes.

1:11:36.250 --> 1:11:39.541
Okay. I understand. Mm-hmm.

1:11:39.625 --> 1:11:40.625
Thank you.

1:11:41.416 --> 1:11:44.000
Hey, Jeff, thanks for coming in.
How're you feeling?

1:11:44.541 --> 1:11:45.541
Uh, I'm good.

1:11:46.250 --> 1:11:50.750
All right, good. Uh, listen,
this breaks my heart wide open.

1:11:50.833 --> 1:11:55.625
But Protcom are insisting
on one last trial to establish a baseline.

1:11:55.708 --> 1:11:56.541
Uh, we…

1:11:56.625 --> 1:12:01.041
You have to administer Darkenfloxx
to someone you've never shared N-40 with.

1:12:05.916 --> 1:12:06.916
Someone who?

1:12:07.958 --> 1:12:11.166
That's what breaks my heart, Jeff.
It really does.

1:12:12.333 --> 1:12:14.000
Eh, Mark, if you would.

1:12:28.166 --> 1:12:31.375
No. Sorry, I can't do it.

1:12:31.458 --> 1:12:32.750
Of course you can, Jeff.

1:12:32.833 --> 1:12:35.875
This is the last time
anyone's gonna get Darkenfloxxed, okay?

1:12:35.958 --> 1:12:37.625
Yeah, uh, Lizzy doesn't deserve this.

1:12:37.708 --> 1:12:39.875
It won't go as far this time.
You have my word.

1:12:39.958 --> 1:12:41.208
You're not listening to me.

1:12:41.291 --> 1:12:44.291
Jeff, come on. You sound nothing like
the guy that first arrived here.

1:12:44.375 --> 1:12:47.458
That guy would've done anything
to make his crime right.

1:12:47.541 --> 1:12:49.416
Would you just shut up, man?

1:12:53.791 --> 1:12:55.000
I'm not doing it.

1:12:57.916 --> 1:12:58.916
Calm.

1:13:06.375 --> 1:13:09.333
Maybe we should take the night. Yeah?

1:13:10.458 --> 1:13:12.541
Things always feel better in the morning.

1:13:15.291 --> 1:13:16.333
Yeah, sure.

1:13:26.291 --> 1:13:30.583
Just remember, Jeff, uh, what you did
won't have to happen to anyone again.

1:13:31.541 --> 1:13:33.833
Drugs like this
will prevent places like this.

1:13:34.958 --> 1:13:37.250
No more damage, no more damaged people.

1:13:38.458 --> 1:13:41.583
Only you can prevent another you.

1:13:48.916 --> 1:13:50.000
Double his dose.

1:14:05.958 --> 1:14:09.291
I know you're struggling,
but this will help.

1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:15.833
What's in the red one?

1:14:16.958 --> 1:14:19.416
-Sorry.

1:14:24.291 --> 1:14:25.500
It's just a toy.

1:14:30.041 --> 1:14:32.041
The red one's a placebo. We put it--

1:14:32.125 --> 1:14:33.125
Stop.

1:14:34.541 --> 1:14:35.625
Just stop.

1:14:41.125 --> 1:14:43.208
There is no Protocol Committee, is there?

1:14:45.583 --> 1:14:47.000
This is his company.

1:14:48.166 --> 1:14:49.875
I saw his letterhead.

1:14:53.625 --> 1:14:55.250
Abnesti Pharmaceuticals.

1:14:59.125 --> 1:15:00.875
He's the one in charge

1:15:00.958 --> 1:15:04.083
and he's naming the drugs
using a goddamn Bingo card, Mark.

1:15:05.208 --> 1:15:07.583
What are you doing
working at a place like this?

1:15:08.958 --> 1:15:11.875
I mean, all this talk of N-40,
I call bullshit, man.

1:15:13.958 --> 1:15:16.125
Abnesti doesn't care about love.

1:15:18.166 --> 1:15:19.833
No, he cares about the red one.

1:15:22.958 --> 1:15:23.958
B-6.

1:15:28.041 --> 1:15:29.875
How can you go along with this?

1:15:31.625 --> 1:15:33.000
You could work anywhere.

1:15:33.833 --> 1:15:36.250
<i>Why here? Why him?</i>

1:15:41.250 --> 1:15:43.500
There are so few geniuses.

1:15:46.625 --> 1:15:48.750
<i>He promised me we would change the world.</i>

1:15:51.333 --> 1:15:53.041
<i>I just wanted to help people.</i>

1:15:57.500 --> 1:15:58.666
You still can.

1:16:26.541 --> 1:16:28.833
Hey, Jeff, man of the hour.

1:16:31.583 --> 1:16:34.458
Hope you got some sleep,
thought things over, yeah?

1:16:35.333 --> 1:16:37.458
Why don't you, uh, take the driver's seat?

1:16:37.541 --> 1:16:38.708
Mark's out today.

1:16:38.791 --> 1:16:41.375
He's got a stuffed up nose
or something.

1:16:43.458 --> 1:16:44.500
Millennials, huh?

1:16:47.041 --> 1:16:49.875
Sorry, that's a… It's an unfair word.

1:16:49.958 --> 1:16:52.833
You think about it,
someone arbitrarily decides

1:16:52.916 --> 1:16:56.583
that everyone born between this date
and that date, they all act the same.

1:16:56.666 --> 1:17:00.333
It's like a… A horoscope, but stupider.

1:17:04.041 --> 1:17:05.791
You and Mark are nothing alike.

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:08.000
I don't know.

1:17:09.041 --> 1:17:10.958
It was Mark who made me reconsider.

1:17:12.125 --> 1:17:13.166
Ah.

1:17:13.250 --> 1:17:16.333
Well, I'll forgive his sniffles.

1:17:22.375 --> 1:17:25.958
Anyway, so it's you and me
and Lizzy, makes three.

1:17:26.833 --> 1:17:27.875
How're you doing, Lizzy?

1:17:29.375 --> 1:17:30.833
Could use some Vitamin D.

1:17:30.916 --> 1:17:33.000
We'll get you
some sunshine soon enough.

1:17:34.416 --> 1:17:35.250
All right, Jeff.

1:17:35.333 --> 1:17:39.666
Uh, I filled Lizzy's vials with
the last of the Darkenfloxx this morning.

1:17:39.750 --> 1:17:41.708
Dumped the rest. Gone.

1:17:42.916 --> 1:17:45.458
Shall we put this thing
behind us for good?

1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:48.291
Fine. Let's do this.

1:17:50.541 --> 1:17:52.416
Lizzy? Drip on?

1:17:53.250 --> 1:17:54.541
Yeah, acknowledge.

1:17:55.708 --> 1:17:59.166
And, Jeff,
give Lizzy the Darkenfloxx.

1:18:33.916 --> 1:18:34.916
Sorry.

1:18:37.041 --> 1:18:38.041
Hmm?

1:18:40.625 --> 1:18:42.000
The answer is still no.

1:18:43.875 --> 1:18:45.166
J… Jeff.

1:18:46.958 --> 1:18:49.375
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1:18:53.833 --> 1:18:56.625
Okay. What are we
up against here, Jeff? Huh?

1:18:57.291 --> 1:19:01.083
You think you love her?
You don't even know her.

1:19:01.166 --> 1:19:04.458
I swear, the judgment on display
in this fucking building!

1:19:05.625 --> 1:19:08.333
How about
a little share circle, huh? Yeah.

1:19:08.416 --> 1:19:10.833
Why don't you
tell Jeff what you're in for?

1:19:10.916 --> 1:19:13.125
-I don't care.
-That's what love is.

1:19:13.208 --> 1:19:15.708
Getting to know each other.
Let's get to know each other.

1:19:15.791 --> 1:19:17.458
Doesn't matter. She already told me.

1:19:17.541 --> 1:19:20.041
-Oh, did she?
-Robbery. Big deal.

1:19:20.666 --> 1:19:22.750
Really? Is that what you told him, Lizzy?

1:19:22.833 --> 1:19:24.666
Your future husband, father of your kids.

1:19:24.750 --> 1:19:27.416
He deserves to know the truth.
Tell him. Come on.

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:28.833
Hmm?

1:19:28.916 --> 1:19:29.833
You don't have to.

1:19:29.916 --> 1:19:31.041
Come on. Tell him.

1:19:31.125 --> 1:19:33.708
Come on, Lizzy, tell him. Tell him.

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:38.291
No? All right, I'll do it. Okay?

1:19:38.375 --> 1:19:41.583
It's cool. I got your files right here.
Let's, uh… Let's see.

1:19:42.291 --> 1:19:44.500
Yeah? Let's find out about Lizzy.

1:19:44.583 --> 1:19:46.500
-Get to know each other.
-I don't need you to.

1:19:46.583 --> 1:19:49.416
-I know who I am and what I've done.
-Elizabeth Dianne Harris.

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:51.458
Born in Prescott, Arizona.

1:19:51.541 --> 1:19:54.666
-Raised in a group home…
-I don't need you to. I know who I am.

1:19:54.750 --> 1:19:57.708
I know who I am!
I'm the mother who killed her baby.

1:20:10.583 --> 1:20:11.875
That's who I am, Jeff.

1:20:14.791 --> 1:20:17.875
The mother
who forgot her little girl in her car

1:20:17.958 --> 1:20:21.166
at a Walmart parking lot
in July for three hours…

1:20:24.041 --> 1:20:25.375
while I went to work.

1:20:28.791 --> 1:20:31.666
One count, reckless endangerment.
One count, manslaughter

1:20:33.541 --> 1:20:35.333
of my nine-month-old little girl.

1:20:38.333 --> 1:20:39.333
My own…

1:20:42.666 --> 1:20:44.291
My own flesh and blood.

1:20:54.958 --> 1:20:59.708
Now, I don't know what kind of
sick-ass experiment this is,

1:21:01.416 --> 1:21:05.708
but whatever he wants you to do to me,
come on, let's get on with it, okay?

1:21:05.791 --> 1:21:09.291
The quicker we get over with,
it'll be better for all of us.

1:21:12.250 --> 1:21:13.958
Come on, man. You can't hurt me.

1:21:18.208 --> 1:21:19.291
You can't hurt me.

1:21:20.291 --> 1:21:22.125
There's no greater pain
than having to wake up

1:21:22.208 --> 1:21:25.166
every fucking morning without her. Okay?

1:21:26.375 --> 1:21:28.666
And I know you think you love me,

1:21:28.750 --> 1:21:32.375
but anything in me worth loving
died with her long ago.

1:21:32.458 --> 1:21:36.041
So, come on. Let's do it.
Come on. Give it to me.

1:21:36.666 --> 1:21:37.833
Fucking give it to me.

1:21:38.625 --> 1:21:41.791
Give it to me! Fucking do your job, Jeff!

1:21:41.875 --> 1:21:43.416
Give it to me!

1:21:46.041 --> 1:21:47.250
Give it to me.

1:21:48.083 --> 1:21:49.083
Please.

1:22:18.541 --> 1:22:19.541
Sorry.

1:22:20.666 --> 1:22:21.708
What's so funny?

1:22:22.750 --> 1:22:24.208
Uh, no…

1:22:24.291 --> 1:22:26.083
Her sitting in there, this whole thing,

1:22:26.166 --> 1:22:28.958
you with that phone,
everyone acting all serious.

1:22:30.166 --> 1:22:32.333
Is it just me who finds this amusing?

1:22:34.208 --> 1:22:35.208
Yeah.

1:22:36.166 --> 1:22:37.666
-Only you.

1:22:50.291 --> 1:22:52.583
-Mark's not sick, is he?

1:22:54.583 --> 1:22:56.250
-Give me that.
-No.

1:22:59.250 --> 1:23:02.750
Stop it. Stop it, you're scaring me, okay?

1:23:02.833 --> 1:23:05.875
-Just stop. Stop. Please don't hurt me.

1:23:05.958 --> 1:23:07.458
Don't… Don't hurt me. Okay?

1:23:08.666 --> 1:23:11.166
-Oh, fuck. Christ.

1:23:13.708 --> 1:23:14.708
God…

1:23:15.083 --> 1:23:17.833
Mark spiked my MobiPak.

1:23:17.916 --> 1:23:22.750
That's right. He emptied my MobiPak
and gave you Darkenfloxx.

1:23:23.583 --> 1:23:25.916
<i>He's coming back here</i>
<i>right now with the police.</i>

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.666
<i>How could he?</i>

1:23:27.750 --> 1:23:29.875
He and I… You and I were…

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:32.458
Make it stop!

1:23:33.958 --> 1:23:36.041
-Can I get you something…
-Make it stop!

1:23:36.125 --> 1:23:37.458
…for how you're feeling?

1:23:38.583 --> 1:23:40.791
That was the first thing you said to me…

1:23:42.875 --> 1:23:46.416
…the acknowledgement that you needed
for the most important study of them all.

1:23:46.500 --> 1:23:48.291
-And what did we say?
-Yes!

1:23:49.375 --> 1:23:51.166
What were we saying yes to, huh?

1:23:51.250 --> 1:23:54.708
What were we agreeing
to put in our bodies every single day?

1:23:57.541 --> 1:23:59.375
-B-6.

1:23:59.458 --> 1:24:01.833
It doesn't make you
happy or hungry or horny.

1:24:01.916 --> 1:24:03.666
It makes you do as you're told.

1:24:03.750 --> 1:24:08.000
"Laugh, stop laughing.
Eat, stop eating. Fuck, stop fucking!"

1:24:08.916 --> 1:24:12.458
You weren't testing those other drugs.
You were testing B-6.

1:24:12.541 --> 1:24:14.083
Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry.

1:24:14.625 --> 1:24:16.208
-I'm sorry.

1:24:19.666 --> 1:24:21.583
What were you gonna call it?

1:24:25.083 --> 1:24:25.958
Fine then.

1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:32.458
What were you going to call it?

1:24:33.541 --> 1:24:35.583
O-B-D-X.

1:24:36.291 --> 1:24:37.833
Obediex.

1:24:39.708 --> 1:24:40.875
<i>And it did work.</i>

1:24:40.958 --> 1:24:44.916
Enough for you to live amongst killers.
But not enough for a gold star. Why?

1:24:46.375 --> 1:24:48.250
B-6 had to be perfect.

1:24:48.333 --> 1:24:50.125
The goal wasn't obedience.

1:24:50.208 --> 1:24:53.291
It was absolute obedience
without exceptions.

1:24:54.166 --> 1:24:57.166
We had to know,
could we get you to follow an order

1:24:57.250 --> 1:25:01.583
antithetical to
your deepest values and emotions.

1:25:01.666 --> 1:25:04.541
Do the very thing
you'd least want to do in the world.

1:25:05.458 --> 1:25:06.958
Hurt someone you love.

1:25:07.041 --> 1:25:10.791
B-6 could force you to repeat
the precise act you most regretted,

1:25:10.875 --> 1:25:13.375
to harm another,
someone you held dear.

1:25:13.458 --> 1:25:15.666
It could force anyone to do anything.

1:25:16.750 --> 1:25:18.125
I trusted you.

1:25:19.208 --> 1:25:21.833
We trusted you with our lives!

1:25:23.416 --> 1:25:26.083
You made us do
all this shit to each other,

1:25:26.166 --> 1:25:28.458
thinking it was our choice,
but it was yours.

1:25:29.791 --> 1:25:31.083
You took away our--

1:25:31.166 --> 1:25:33.000
Your what? Your free will, Jeff?

1:25:33.083 --> 1:25:35.875
Oh, God. Where did that get you, huh?

1:25:38.375 --> 1:25:39.750
Can't you picture it?

1:25:39.833 --> 1:25:43.041
A world filled with people
who do as they're told.

1:25:47.458 --> 1:25:50.083
We'd be selling peace and harmony itself.

1:25:50.166 --> 1:25:53.916
The ability to compel people to act
on behalf of the greater good.

1:25:55.791 --> 1:25:58.500
Behave, not as they want,
but as they damn well should.

1:26:00.333 --> 1:26:05.125
No more drunks crashing cars.
Husbands killing wives.

1:26:05.208 --> 1:26:06.625
Kids left at summer camp.

1:26:09.541 --> 1:26:11.375
What does it matter? B-6 failed.

1:26:12.708 --> 1:26:15.375
I want you to tell the world
what you did to Heather.

1:26:16.875 --> 1:26:20.541
Man, I could go to…
I could go to prison, it would ruin me.

1:26:20.625 --> 1:26:23.416
Everything I built.
I could go to prison, Jeff.

1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:27.125
Jeff and Steve. Not that different.

1:26:29.208 --> 1:26:30.041
Yeah.

1:26:31.583 --> 1:26:32.583
What's so funny?

1:26:35.833 --> 1:26:38.333
You were free to go seven months ago.

1:26:39.541 --> 1:26:42.750
And Lizzy, her appeal
just fell on very sympathetic ears.

1:26:43.208 --> 1:26:44.625
She's been free for a week.

1:26:52.791 --> 1:26:56.583
She's walking out of here. Today.

1:26:57.708 --> 1:26:59.458
Open the front door.

1:27:06.958 --> 1:27:10.291
I'm gonna make sure
you never do this to anyone ever again.

1:27:22.333 --> 1:27:23.541
Give me the knife.

1:27:26.625 --> 1:27:29.916
I said… give it to me.

1:27:30.958 --> 1:27:31.958
Why?

1:27:34.041 --> 1:27:35.875
Because I told you to, Steve,

1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:39.750
and because I put enough B-6
in your veins to tame a goddamn lion.

1:27:45.791 --> 1:27:46.916
Really works, huh?

1:27:48.250 --> 1:27:51.750
Not when someone has been told
to kill the only thing he's ever loved.

1:27:54.666 --> 1:27:55.833
I learned that from you.

1:28:12.833 --> 1:28:15.500
I just Darkenfloxxed Lizzy.
All four vials.

1:29:31.750 --> 1:29:33.000
Hey.

1:29:45.666 --> 1:29:47.833
-It's okay. You're okay.

1:29:50.875 --> 1:29:52.666
It's okay.

1:29:54.708 --> 1:29:56.791
I'm so… I'm so sorry.

1:29:57.333 --> 1:29:58.333
For what?

1:29:59.375 --> 1:30:01.416
I'm sorry I lied.

1:30:01.500 --> 1:30:03.083
Lizzy, I love you.

1:30:04.875 --> 1:30:06.791
Nothing you said or did
is gonna change that.

1:30:25.291 --> 1:30:26.958
Friends and neighbors,

1:30:27.041 --> 1:30:30.333
I'm sorry to interrupt,
particularly with news like this.

1:30:32.041 --> 1:30:33.833
We have an attempted escape.

1:30:34.625 --> 1:30:36.750
Most of you know Jeff and Lizzy.

1:30:41.583 --> 1:30:43.208
Most of you know Jeff and Lizzy,

1:30:43.291 --> 1:30:47.500
<i>and it saddens me to my core</i>
<i>that they have misled the authorities</i>

1:30:47.583 --> 1:30:49.000
<i>who are on the way here now.</i>

1:30:49.083 --> 1:30:51.375
I explained that that would mean
the end of the program

1:30:51.458 --> 1:30:55.125
and the comfortable life that it affords
us all, but they wouldn't listen.

1:30:57.708 --> 1:30:58.708
Oh, no.

1:31:02.541 --> 1:31:06.291
Do any of you relish
the thought of returning to State?

1:31:06.375 --> 1:31:08.708
<i>What would you</i>
<i>be willing to do to prevent that</i>

1:31:08.791 --> 1:31:11.375
<i>to preserve the noble mission…</i>

1:31:11.458 --> 1:31:12.291
<i>Fuck!</i>

1:31:12.375 --> 1:31:14.083
…to which we've devoted our lives?

1:31:15.708 --> 1:31:17.375
Fucking piece of shit!

1:31:23.291 --> 1:31:27.416
Stop Jeff and Lizzy, not for me, for you.

1:31:32.791 --> 1:31:33.958
Fuck!

1:31:50.125 --> 1:31:50.958
Shit-finger?

1:32:11.166 --> 1:32:12.625
I knew it was you, snack man.

1:32:55.208 --> 1:32:56.083
There they are!

1:33:17.500 --> 1:33:20.125
-Come on, get 'em. Get up! Come on!

1:33:28.583 --> 1:33:30.000
-Hold on, Dave.

1:33:31.958 --> 1:33:33.458
I have a key to the pantry.

1:33:35.541 --> 1:33:37.333
It has food in it for, like, six months.

1:33:40.875 --> 1:33:43.625
Awesome. Thanks.

1:34:22.458 --> 1:34:25.041
Alpha Whiskey Delta,
departing to the north.

1:34:31.916 --> 1:34:34.333
-Alpha Whiskey Delta…

1:34:34.416 --> 1:34:36.750
…on climb, 2,000 feet,

1:34:38.416 --> 1:34:40.458
heading east to track zero…

1:34:45.083 --> 1:34:46.083
Sorry.

1:34:48.166 --> 1:34:50.041
Zero-nine-zero…

1:34:50.541 --> 1:34:52.291
Heading zero…

1:34:53.583 --> 1:34:56.291
<i>Alpha Whiskey</i>
<i>Delta, that transmission was gargled.</i>

1:34:56.375 --> 1:34:58.000
<i>Do you require any assistance?</i>

1:34:59.291 --> 1:35:00.875
Handle your…

1:35:00.958 --> 1:35:03.291
Handle your… Handle your shit.

1:36:03.291 --> 1:36:05.625
<i>Alpha Whiskey Delta,</i>
<i>confirm intentions.</i>

1:36:05.708 --> 1:36:09.625
<i>We have you bearing northwest, 315,</i>
<i>descending below 500 feet.</i>

1:36:09.708 --> 1:36:10.833
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1:36:18.875 --> 1:36:21.916
-<i>Glide slope. Pull up.</i>

1:36:22.500 --> 1:36:24.833
<i>Glide slope. Pull up.</i>

1:36:25.666 --> 1:36:27.500
<i>Glide slope. Pull up.</i>

1:36:27.583 --> 1:36:28.625
It's beautiful.

1:37:08.791 --> 1:37:10.083
Sun feels nice.

1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.458
<i>I wish there was</i>
<i>a self-forgiveness drug.</i>

1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:31.166
<i>You take it and everything starts over.</i>

1:37:31.833 --> 1:37:34.875
<i>Everyone you ever loved,</i>
<i>you did right by them.</i>

1:37:34.958 --> 1:37:39.500
<i>Treated them like gold</i>
<i>and you feel like it's all ahead of me.</i>

1:37:40.041 --> 1:37:43.166
<i>This beautiful life,</i>
<i>all the pleasures of it.</i>

1:37:43.250 --> 1:37:46.125
<i>The love I could give,</i>
<i>the good I could do.</i>

1:37:48.416 --> 1:37:50.083
<i>But there's no drug like that.</i>

1:37:53.041 --> 1:37:55.208
<i>So, we're gonna</i>
<i>have to do it for ourselves.</i>
