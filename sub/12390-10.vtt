07:51.340 --> 07:54.468
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BITE.
WHAT'S THE JOKE?

07:54.510 --> 07:55.807
JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

07:55.850 --> 07:56.908
YOU GOT HOME ALL RIGHT
LAST NIGHT.

07:56.950 --> 07:58.019
FROM WHAT?
BAR.

07:58.050 --> 07:59.039
WHAT BAR?

07:59.090 --> 08:00.079
YOU WERE
AT A BAR?

08:00.120 --> 08:00.950
NO, I WASN'T
AT A BAR.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.848
I DON'T DRINK.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.027
YOU DON'T DRINK?

08:04.060 --> 08:05.891
WELL, OKAY, WINE.

08:05.930 --> 08:07.090
AT WEDDINGS.

08:07.140 --> 08:08.960
AN OCCASIONAL
SNIFI'ER OF BRANDY.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.102
MAYBE A GOOD SINGLE-MALT SCOTCH.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.505
SOUNDS LIKE DRINKING TO ME.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.006
SPENCER...

08:13.050 --> 08:15.484
STOP MAKING UP STORIES, OKAY?
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY BOGUS.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.250
OKAY, SO YOU WERE NOT
AT TOM BLAIR'S PUB LAST NIGHT?

08:18.290 --> 08:20.099
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO TOM BLAIR IS.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.360
MM-HM, AND HOW'D YOU GET
THAT SWEET BRUISE

08:22.400 --> 08:23.662
ON YOUR FOREHEAD?

08:23.700 --> 08:24.837
I HAD AN ALTERCATION.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.098
YES, WITH A TABLE.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.937
WITH A SUSPECT.
IF WE'RE DONE,

08:27.980 --> 08:30.278
I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO MOVE ON WITH MY DAY.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.049
I GET IT.

08:32.090 --> 08:34.285
YESTERDAY WAS A...

08:34.320 --> 08:35.856
A TOUGH ANNIVERSARY
FOR YOU.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.892
WHAT?

08:37.930 --> 08:39.989
WHO HAVE YOU
BEEN TALKING TO?

08:40.030 --> 08:42.169
NOBODY.

08:42.210 --> 08:49.480
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.351
OKAY...

08:51.390 --> 08:52.618
WE GOT TO SOLVE
THAT CASE.

08:52.660 --> 08:53.729
WHAT CASE?

08:53.760 --> 08:55.022
THE ONE LASSITER
CAN'T SOLVE.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.220
HE'S GOING TO HIRE US
FOR A CASE?

08:56.270 --> 08:57.669
OH, GOD, NO,
HE'D NEVER DO THAT.

08:57.700 --> 08:58.667
SO WE WON'T
GET PAID?

08:58.710 --> 08:59.665
EXACTLY.

08:59.710 --> 09:00.972
AND WE'RE JUST DOING IT
FOR THE GLORY?

09:01.010 --> 09:01.078
NOPE.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.149
WE GIVE LASSITER
ALL THE CREDIT.

09:03.180 --> 09:04.317
IN FACT, I DON'T
EVEN THINK

09:04.350 --> 09:05.647
HE CAN KNOW
WE'RE HELPING HIM.

09:05.690 --> 09:07.954
DUDE, THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA, SHAWN.

09:07.990 --> 09:09.014
I DITCH OUT OF WORK

09:09.060 --> 09:10.220
ON THE DAY WE RELEASE
THREE NEW PRODUCTS

09:10.260 --> 09:11.352
TO SPEND TIME
ON AN UNSOLVABLE CASE

09:11.400 --> 09:13.368
IN WHICH
WE WON'T GET PAID,

09:13.400 --> 09:14.662
AND SOMEONE ELSE
GETS ALL THE CREDIT.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.305
THAT WAS THE BEST NUT-SHELLING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

09:17.340 --> 09:18.671
WE MADE A DEAL.
YESTERDAY.

09:18.710 --> 09:19.779
WE'RE EQUAL PARTNERS.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.346
THAT MEANS WE
COLLECT IVELY DECIDE

09:21.380 --> 09:24.019
WHICH APPOINTMENTS TO MAKE,
WHICH CASES TO TAKE.

09:24.050 --> 09:25.187
WE HAVE TO LIVE BY THAT,
AT LEAST FOR A DAY.

09:25.230 --> 09:26.185
ESPECIALLY TODAY.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.152
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.497
THAT'S GOING TO BE
A PROBLEM, THOUGH.
WHY?

09:29.530 --> 09:30.394
BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY
GOT A MEETING

09:30.440 --> 09:31.429
WITH THE DEAD GUY'S
WIDOW.

09:31.470 --> 09:32.402
WHEN?
10 MINUTES.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.532
LOOK, DON'T WORRY.

09:33.570 --> 09:34.798
I'M GOING TO DO IT
IN THE CHIEF'S OFFICE.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.478
I JUST NEED YOU TO
STAND GUARD AT THE DOOR,

09:36.510 --> 09:38.046
MAKE SURE NO ONE
CATCHES US IN THERE.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.183
IT'S GOING TO DOUBLE
THE EXCITEMENT.

09:39.220 --> 09:40.312
MAYBE TRIPLE IT.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.521
NOW, COME ON,
WHO'S IN?

09:42.560 --> 09:44.050
DON'T FOOL AROUND.

09:44.090 --> 09:44.988
I CAN'T HOLD MY HAND LIKE THIS
FOR VERY LONG.

09:45.030 --> 09:47.362
GUS, I GET VERY
POOR CIRCULATION

09:47.400 --> 09:53.305
TO THE LIMBIC
REGIONS.

09:53.350 --> 09:55.568
NOW MY PINKY'S GOING NUMB.

09:55.620 --> 09:56.917
I GUESS EVERYTHING
STARTED TO CHANGE

09:56.960 --> 09:58.552
AT THE BEGINNING
OF LAST SUMMER.

09:58.590 --> 10:00.990
HE PARTNERED WITH
HIS OLD FRIEND, HUGO,

10:01.030 --> 10:02.327
AND THEY FINALLY GOT ACCEPTED
FOR EIGHT MONTHS

10:02.370 --> 10:03.428
ON THE NEW DIGITAL TELESCOPE

10:03.470 --> 10:05.233
AT THE SPACE CENTER.

10:05.270 --> 10:06.305
EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL
FOR TWO WEEKS,

10:06.340 --> 10:08.103
AND THEN, SUDDENLY,

10:08.140 --> 10:09.903
BRYANT STARTED TO WORK
REALLY LONG HOURS.

10:09.950 --> 10:12.180
I SEE.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.778
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?

10:13.820 --> 10:14.809
I LIKE IT.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.418
IT'S A GIFT FROM A FRIEND.

10:16.460 --> 10:19.293
HE'S A GLASS-BLOWER.

10:19.330 --> 10:21.389
WOULD YOU SAY THAT'S WHEN
HE STARTED FEELING SICK, MARY?

10:21.440 --> 10:23.305
NOT SICK, JUST A LITTLE OFF.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.479
OH, WE DID CANCEL
OUR 4th OF JULY TRIP,

10:25.510 --> 10:28.013
SO I GUESS IT WAS
AROUND THAT TIME.

10:28.050 --> 10:31.281
I'M SORRY,
SOMETHING IS REALLY BUGGING ME.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.321
YOUR NAME
IS LASSITER TOO?

10:32.360 --> 10:33.384
YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

10:33.430 --> 10:34.499
CARLTON LASSITER.

10:34.530 --> 10:35.792
BUT YOU'RE NOT AFFILIATED

10:35.830 --> 10:37.434
WITH THE DETECTIVE
CARLTON LASSITER

10:37.470 --> 10:38.459
WHO I MET BEFORE?

10:38.500 --> 10:39.603
NOT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.800
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.912
MATTER OF FACT,
I SPELL MINE WITH A "K."

10:43.950 --> 10:46.339
TWO OF THEM.

10:46.390 --> 10:49.689
MARY, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'RE...

10:49.730 --> 10:51.095
LEAVING OUT?

10:51.130 --> 10:52.324
MAYBE SOMETHING
THAT'S...

10:52.370 --> 10:53.564
SLIPPED YOUR MIND?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.295
SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME

10:55.340 --> 10:58.776
BECAUSE IT MAY EMBARRASSED
AND/OR SHAME YOU?

10:58.810 --> 10:59.879
IT COULD BE VITAL.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.549
I KNOW THIS PROBABLY ISN'T TRUE,

11:02.590 --> 11:04.285
BUT I STARTED TO SUSPECT
THAT HE...

11:04.320 --> 11:05.389
WAS CHEATING ON YOU?

11:05.420 --> 11:06.387
WELL, YES.

11:06.430 --> 11:07.522
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

11:07.560 --> 11:08.629
A SHOT IN THE DARK.

11:08.670 --> 11:09.625
THE LONG HOURS.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.228
HE WAS CONSUMED WITH HIS WORK.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.500
HE WAS DIFFERENT.
DISTANT.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.132
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
TO SAY IT OUT LOUD.

11:15.180 --> 11:16.579
PLEASE, DON'T.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.770
BRYANT WASN'T REALLY THE TYPE.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.412
WE WERE PLANNING
A FUTURE.

11:19.450 --> 11:20.587
HE WANTED TO TRY
FOR A BABY.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.281
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.925
THANKS AGAIN
FOR COMING IN, MARY.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.689
NO PROBLEM,
K-KARLTON.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.264
CARLTON?

11:28.300 --> 11:31.098
YES, KARLTON, WITH A "K."

11:31.140 --> 11:32.129
TWO "K"s.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.772
THE SECOND ONE
IS SILENT.

11:33.810 --> 11:35.175
MAY I SPEAK TO YOU
PRIVATELY

11:35.220 --> 11:39.486
IN YOUR OFFICE, K-KARLTON?

11:39.530 --> 11:40.451
CERTAINLY.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.819
THAN KS.

11:41.860 --> 11:44.192
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
REOPENING THE VALLERY CASE?

11:44.230 --> 11:46.130
REOPENING?

11:46.170 --> 11:48.104
COME ON, THAT WORD
HAS SO MANY SYLLABLES.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.801
THAT CASE WAS DETERMINED
NOT TO BE A CASE,

11:49.850 --> 11:52.045
DESPITE DETECTIVE LASSITER'S
BEST EFFORTS.

11:52.090 --> 11:54.752
[LAUGHS GRUDGINGLY]:
SHAWN...

11:54.790 --> 11:57.588
NOW, I NEED A WHOLE LOT
OF AN EXPLANATION FROM YOU,

11:57.630 --> 11:59.291
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH YOU DO
MAKE ME LAUGH

11:59.330 --> 12:00.763
OCCASIONALLY,

12:00.800 --> 12:01.437
IMPERSONATING AN OFFICER--

12:01.440 --> 12:03.135
IMPERSONATING?
PLEASE.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.400
I TOLD THAT WOMAN
I WAS IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.407
SHAWN!

12:06.450 --> 12:08.247
COME CLEAN.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.680
I WOULD LIKE TO SOLVE THIS CASE
FOR LASSITER.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.153
HE'LL NEVER ALLOW IT.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.657
THAT'S WHY HE CAN'T
KNOW I'M INVOLVED.

12:13.690 --> 12:16.227
I FIGURE I CAN GUIDE HIM
THROUGH THIS THING, RIGHT?

12:16.270 --> 12:17.862
BUILD HIM UP,
GET HIM BACK ON HIS FEET AGAIN.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.265
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

12:19.300 --> 12:20.369
YEAH.

12:20.410 --> 12:21.672
WHY?

12:21.710 --> 12:22.745
I JUST...

12:22.780 --> 12:25.442
FEEL LIKE HE REALLY NEEDS THIS.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.688
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

12:28.720 --> 12:29.721
OKAY, I'M IN.

12:29.760 --> 12:30.988
YOU'RE WHAT?

12:31.030 --> 12:41.144
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

12:41.180 --> 12:42.215
[GUS SIGHS HEAVILY]

12:43.390 --> 12:44.345
SO?

12:44.390 --> 12:45.459
SO HE'S ALWAYS HOME,

12:45.490 --> 12:46.479
AND HE ALWAYS ANSWERS HIS PHONE

12:46.530 --> 12:48.418
AFTER TWO RINGS.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.121
THIS IS ACTUALLY
SOMEWHAT TROUBLING.

12:50.170 --> 12:50.659
WHY?

12:50.700 --> 12:52.804
"WHY?"

12:52.840 --> 12:54.068
"FISH DERBY"'S ON.

12:54.110 --> 12:55.270
WHAT IS THIS?

12:55.310 --> 12:56.470
IT'S THE BRYANT VALLERY CASE.

12:56.510 --> 12:57.613
THE ONE FROM THIS MORNING?

12:57.650 --> 12:58.969
AND THE REST
OF THE WEEK.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.487
I PREDICT WE WILL
SOLVE IT FRIDAY

13:00.520 --> 13:01.555
AT 10:01 P.M.,

13:01.560 --> 13:03.357
AND THEN MAYBE WATCH SOME CABLE.

13:03.390 --> 13:04.482
SOUNDS GREAT.

13:04.530 --> 13:05.724
AND DID YOU FIND A PARTNER

13:05.770 --> 13:07.465
THAT'S WILLING
TO DO THIS WITH YOU?

13:07.500 --> 13:08.637
JULES IS IN,

13:08.670 --> 13:10.501
MY DAD IS CLEARLY MISSING,
OR SOMETHING...

13:10.540 --> 13:11.905
DUDE, THAT LEAVES YOU.

13:11.950 --> 13:13.008
GUS, YOU GET TO STEP UP

13:13.050 --> 13:14.142
IN A BIG FAT WAY.

13:14.180 --> 13:15.215
YOU HAVE ONE JOB.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.217
I HAVE TWO JOBS,
SHAWN.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.285
I HAVE PRESENTATIONS
TO MEMORIZE

13:17.320 --> 13:18.651
ON THREE NEW DRUGS,

13:18.690 --> 13:19.952
AND WHILE YOU WERE OUT DRINKING
LAST NIGHT

13:19.990 --> 13:21.025
AND TAKING ON
FREE CASES,

13:21.060 --> 13:22.493
I WAS UP
HALF THE NIGHT

13:22.530 --> 13:23.929
DREAMING ABOUT WHETHER
THE GELCAPS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE

13:23.970 --> 13:24.959
THAN THE TABLETS.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.706
FIRST OF ALL, TABLETS.

13:26.740 --> 13:27.707
ALWAYS TABLETS.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.298
THAT'S A GIVEN.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.773
SECONDLY, I'VE BEEN HAVING
THIS REOCCURRING DREAM

13:31.820 --> 13:34.687
WHERE I'M FLYING OVER AUCKLAND
ON THE BACK OF A SWAN

13:34.720 --> 13:36.051
MADE PRIMARILY
OF COCOA.

13:36.090 --> 13:37.193
HIS NAME IS CLEM,

13:37.230 --> 13:39.494
BUT YOUR DREAM WAS...

13:39.530 --> 13:40.736
PRETTY INTERESTING TOO.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.260
AND THIRDLY,

13:42.310 --> 13:44.608
I GUARANTEE YOU
THAT AFTER YOU HEAR THIS REASON,

13:44.640 --> 13:46.676
YOU WILL DEFINITELY
WANT TO TAKE THIS CASE.

13:46.710 --> 13:48.849
I DOUBT IT, BUT...
GIVE IT A SHOT.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.347
THE VICTIM WAS AN ASTRONOMER.

13:50.390 --> 13:51.687
YEAH.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.381
THEY GUY DIED WHILE HE WAS
WORKING THE NIGHT SKY

13:53.430 --> 13:54.624
AT THE OBSERVATORY.

13:54.660 --> 13:59.632
[LAUGHS DISDAIN FULLY]

13:59.670 --> 14:01.501
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK
THAT WOULD MATTER?

14:01.540 --> 14:02.677
OH, COME ON.

14:02.710 --> 14:05.144
I KNOW YOU GO DOWN
TO THE SPACE CENTER.

14:05.180 --> 14:06.442
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS, SHAWN.

14:06.490 --> 14:07.559
THURSDAYS.
I'M NEVER THERE--

14:07.590 --> 14:08.557
IN THE AFTERNOON,
AROUND 2:00.

14:08.590 --> 14:09.727
HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWING ME?

14:09.760 --> 14:10.681
MAYBE.

14:10.730 --> 14:12.322
SOMETIMES.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.295
TO SHARPEN AND REFINE
MY TAILING SKILLS, YES.

14:15.340 --> 14:16.307
THIS IS EXACTLY
THE SORT OF THING

14:16.340 --> 14:17.364
I WAS TALKING ABOUT,
SHAWN.

14:17.410 --> 14:18.536
OKAY, I APOLOGIZE,
GUS, I DO,

14:18.580 --> 14:19.808
BUT IT'S ALL GOOD.

14:19.850 --> 14:21.579
SO YOU LIKE ASTRONOMY.
I ACCEPT THAT.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.178
THIS CONVERSATION
IS OVER.

14:23.220 --> 14:25.051
OKAY, DON'T GO
ALL VINCENT GALLO ON ME.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.227
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED, MAN.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.727
LOOK,
SOME GUY DIES

14:27.760 --> 14:29.557
AT A SPACE CENTER THAT
YOU FREQUENTLY SNEAK OFF TO?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.568
WE GOT TO
GET DOWN THERE,

14:31.600 --> 14:34.000
AND WE GOT TO DO
SOME SERIOUS SPACE-DIGGING.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.075
NO, WE DON'T.

14:35.110 --> 14:36.646
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

14:36.680 --> 14:38.079
NOW THAT I KNOW YOU'RE
TAILING ME WHILE I'M AT WORK,

14:38.120 --> 14:39.473
GET READY TO GET LOST
IN MY DUST.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.589
OKAY, DUST?

14:40.620 --> 14:42.087
WHAT ARE YOU,
GOING OFF-ROADING?

14:42.120 --> 14:43.781
I'M GOING TO BE UN-CATCHABLE,
LIKE A JACKAL.

14:43.830 --> 14:45.821
LIKE A JACKAL?

14:45.870 --> 14:48.088
HOW ABOUT I JUST TAIL YOU
TO THE OBSERVATORY?

14:48.140 --> 14:52.042
CONSIDER ME
STEALTH, SHAWN.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.399
DUDE, THAT'S WEIRD.

14:53.450 --> 15:03.496
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE...
LIKE YOU'RE A BOBBLE-HEAD.

15:03.500 --> 15:13.512
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE...
LIKE YOU'RE A BOBBLE-HEAD.

15:51.060 --> 15:52.664
EXCUSE ME...

15:52.700 --> 15:54.224
I HAVE
AN ANNUAL PASS--

15:54.270 --> 15:56.135
OH, I'M SORRY, SIR,

15:56.170 --> 15:57.364
I DIDN'T SEE YOU STANDING THERE,

15:57.410 --> 16:01.744
YOU KNOW, BEING SO STEALTH-LIKE.

16:01.780 --> 16:09.221
[OVER INTERCOM]:
THE JACKAL HAS ARRIVED.

16:09.270 --> 16:10.396
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, SHAWN?

16:10.430 --> 16:11.431
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
DUDE, WE'RE UNDERCOVER.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.505
WE ARE NOT
UNDERCOVER.

16:12.540 --> 16:13.507
SURE WE ARE.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.564
I'M THE EMPLOYEE,
YOU'RE THE CUSTOMER.

16:14.610 --> 16:15.599
I AM THE CUSTOMER.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.709
SEE? YOU'RE ALREADY
IN CHARACTER,

16:16.750 --> 16:17.705
LIKE DON CHEADLE.

16:17.750 --> 16:18.774
I'M NOT INVOLVED
WITH THIS CASE.

16:18.820 --> 16:20.117
I ONLY NEED YOU
FOR A MINUTE,

16:20.150 --> 16:21.879
LIKE WHEN KENICKIE
NEEDED DANNY ZUKO,

16:21.920 --> 16:23.729
AND YOU GET TO BE TRAVOLTA
IN THE ANALOGY.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.829
TOMORROW
THEY'RE TRAINING ME

16:24.860 --> 16:26.020
ON THE MOTION
SIMULATOR.

16:26.070 --> 16:27.139
TELL ME YOU'VE NEVER
WANTED TO TAKE A RIDE

16:27.170 --> 16:28.535
ON ONE OF THOSE THINGS
BUCK NAKED.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.538
NO, I HAVEN'T.

16:30.570 --> 16:31.935
I'M ONLY HERE
FOR A FEW MINUTES ANYWAY.

16:31.980 --> 16:33.208
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.478
LOOK, THERE'S
THIS CREEPY JANITOR

16:34.520 --> 16:35.942
THAT LURKS ABOUT.

16:35.980 --> 16:37.447
DISTRACT HIM WHILE
I GRILL PLANETARIUM GIRL.

16:37.490 --> 16:39.082
YOU ARE NOT
GRILLING JESSICA.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.882
SHE'S JUST INTERNING HERE
TILL SHE GETS HER COLLEGE UNITS.

16:40.930 --> 16:41.897
JESSICA?

16:41.930 --> 16:43.022
YEAH.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.095
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HER NAME IS JE...

16:45.140 --> 16:46.107
OH, GUS...

16:46.140 --> 16:47.573
WHAT?

16:47.610 --> 16:50.306
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN COMING HERE
ON THURSDAYS TO STUDY THE STARS.

16:50.350 --> 16:52.443
YOU'VE BEEN
COMING HERE FOR HER.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.981
SHUT UP, SHAWN.

16:54.020 --> 16:54.987
IN IROVE
SHUT' UP.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.248
YOU UP.
NO, SHAWN!

16:56.290 --> 16:58.258
SHE IS MY CO-WORKER,
AND I HAVE THE INSIDE TRACK.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.518
LISTEN, THERE ARE WAYS
TO GO ABOUT DOING THIS.

17:00.570 --> 17:02.037
YOU DON'T JUST
WALK UP TO SOMEBODY

17:02.040 --> 17:04.508
AND START WORKING THEM OVER.
YOU GOT TO HAVE A PLAN.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.575
DO YOU HAVE
A PLAN?

17:05.610 --> 17:06.747
OF COURSE
I HAVE A PLAN.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.372
WELL, WOULD YOU MIND
CLUING ME IN, PLEASE?

17:08.420 --> 17:11.719
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN...

17:11.760 --> 17:13.159
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
A LOT LATELY.

17:13.190 --> 17:14.657
SHE JUST--
BROKE UP
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

17:14.690 --> 17:15.998
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

17:16.030 --> 17:17.292
IT'S MY CURSE, APPARENTLY.

17:17.330 --> 17:18.866
WELL, SINCE SHE'S JUST
OFF A BREAK-UP,

17:18.900 --> 17:20.731
I GOT TO MOVE GRADUALLY.

17:20.770 --> 17:21.873
JUST GO OVER THERE
AND ASK HER OUT.

17:21.910 --> 17:22.706
GET HER DIGITS.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.479
SHAWN, THIS IS A QUALITY GIRL.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.410
THAT MEANS I'VE GOT TO PUT IN
QUALITY TIME, OKAY?

17:26.450 --> 17:27.212
OH, HERE SHE COMES.

17:27.260 --> 17:28.750
ACT NATURAL.

17:28.790 --> 17:31.429
HEY, JESSIE...

17:31.460 --> 17:32.961
DO YOU KNOW GUS?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.888
YES.
GUS IS A REGULAR.

17:34.930 --> 17:35.897
THAT'S RIGHT--

17:35.940 --> 17:36.929
YOU KNOW, I WENT
TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH HIM.

17:36.970 --> 17:38.176
OF COURSE,

17:38.210 --> 17:39.768
I DIDN'T HANG OUT
WITH COOL KIDS LIKE GUS

17:39.810 --> 17:40.879
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:40.910 --> 17:43.287
HE WAS A CIF WRESTLING
CHAMPION BACK THEN.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.481
REALLY?
TRUE AS TOAST.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.782
AND IN COLLEGE,
HE WAS A HEISMAN CANDIDATE

17:46.830 --> 17:48.525
UNTIL HE BLEW
HIS KNEE OUT.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.891
DON'T ACT ALL SURPRISED.

17:49.930 --> 17:50.965
WE WERE ALL FOLLOWING YOU
IN THE NEWSPAPERS, MAN.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.092
YOU'RE KIDDING.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.232
WELL, HE IS, ACT UALLY--

17:53.270 --> 17:54.339
I DON'T KID,
EVER.

17:54.370 --> 17:56.474
I IDOLIZED
THIS GUY.

17:56.510 --> 17:57.977
COOLEST DUDE
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.808
WOW, GUS, IT SEEMS THERE'S
A LOT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

18:00.850 --> 18:01.817
WELL, THERE IS--

18:01.860 --> 18:02.155
YEAH, YOU GUYS
SHOULD TOTALLY TALK.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.855
YOU KNOW?

18:03.890 --> 18:05.027
SHARE STUFF
AND WHATNOT,

18:05.060 --> 18:06.994
AND DON'T LET THIS GUY
GRILL YOU TOO MUCH.

18:07.030 --> 18:08.258
[LAUGHING FORCIBLY]

18:08.300 --> 18:09.858
YEAH, WELL,
I'D LOVE TO,

18:09.900 --> 18:11.572
BUT I HAVE TO START
THE PLANETARIUM SHOW.

18:11.610 --> 18:12.804
YEAH, SHE HAS
A PLANETARIUM SHOW--

18:12.840 --> 18:13.875
OH, CAN I DO THAT?

18:13.910 --> 18:14.979
HAVE YOU BEEN TRAINED
ON THE SHOW?

18:15.020 --> 18:18.217
I DID THE CHECKLIST AN HOUR AGO.
PERFECT SCORE.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.352
UH...

18:19.390 --> 18:23.497
QUESTION 18 HAS A TYPO.

18:23.530 --> 18:24.827
OKAY, GREAT.

18:24.870 --> 18:25.939
GO AHEAD, THEN.

18:25.970 --> 18:27.232
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:27.280 --> 18:28.406
OH, THIS
IS GREAT!
GREAT.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.577
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
NO WORRIES.

18:29.610 --> 18:30.577
NO WORRIES.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.077
I GOT IT.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.815
THAN KS, SHAWN.

18:33.850 --> 18:34.817
THAT GUY...

18:34.860 --> 18:36.987
I HEARD ABOUT PLUTO.

18:37.030 --> 18:38.156
THAT'S MESSED UP, RIGHT?

18:38.200 --> 18:44.969
YEAH.

18:45.010 --> 18:46.705
HERE'S
THE BRYANT VALLERY FILE.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.513
W-WHAT?
THE ASTRONOMER?

18:48.550 --> 18:49.949
YES, AND I JUST FINISHED
THE FOLLOW-UP

18:49.980 --> 18:51.015
WITH MARY, THE WIDOW.

18:51.050 --> 18:52.085
YOU WHAT?

18:52.120 --> 18:53.451
YOU ASKED ME TO.
I DID?

18:53.490 --> 18:56.721
IT WAS IN PASSING, AND WOW,
DID IT EVER PAY OFF.

18:56.770 --> 18:57.794
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.899
I WAS?

18:59.940 --> 19:00.929
YEAH, THE WIFE
TOTALLY SUSPECT ED IT.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.005
SHE WHAT?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.873
THAT HE POTENTIALLY
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.717
WELL, ISN'T THAT INTERESTING?

19:06.750 --> 19:09.321
I WANT TO RE-INTERVIEW
EVERYBODY,

19:09.360 --> 19:10.622
AND GIVE ME A COPY
OF THE CORONER'S REPORT.

19:10.660 --> 19:16.667
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS
MORE TO THIS CASE.

19:16.710 --> 19:20.908
HELLO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

19:20.950 --> 19:22.838
I WILL BE YOUR NARRATOR.

19:22.890 --> 19:26.451
MY NAME IS AURORA BOREALIS.

19:26.490 --> 19:28.458
THERE ARE...

19:28.500 --> 19:31.025
OVER FOUR...

19:31.070 --> 19:34.836
HUNDRED STARS IN OUR GALAXY.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.029
MAYBE MORE.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.877
NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.047
MANY HAVE SAID
THAT THE UNIVERSE

19:40.080 --> 19:43.686
IS EVEN LARGER
THAN THE INDIAN OCEAN,

19:43.730 --> 19:46.119
AND THAT IS WHY
IT IS CALLED

19:46.160 --> 19:50.301
"INFINITUM STAROCTOPUSSIUM."

19:50.340 --> 19:53.309
AH, YES...

19:53.350 --> 19:55.614
OUR GLORIOUS CONSTELLATIONS.

19:55.650 --> 19:57.242
THERE THEY ALL ARE,
TAKE A LOOK.

19:57.290 --> 20:00.987
OVER HERE, WE HAVE...

20:01.030 --> 20:02.395
ONE WITH A GUY...

20:02.400 --> 20:05.198
HOLDING SOME SORT OF THING.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.105
OVER HERE,

20:07.140 --> 20:09.631
OUR BELOVED OLYMPIC RINGS,

20:09.680 --> 20:10.749
ALL SEVEN OF THEM,

20:10.780 --> 20:13.169
AND HERE...

20:13.220 --> 20:14.346
HERE'S ONE WITH A FISH.

20:14.390 --> 20:17.553
YOU GOT TO NAME 'EM.

20:17.590 --> 20:20.024
NOTICE, STRAIGHT...

20:20.060 --> 20:22.233
STRAIGHT ABOVE YOU,

20:22.270 --> 20:23.464
"THE HAMMER OF JEFF."

20:23.510 --> 20:25.000
AND OVER THERE, IN THE SOUTH--

20:25.040 --> 20:26.678
NORTH.
NORTH.

20:26.710 --> 20:29.873
YOU'LL SEE "MONKEY WITH RASH."

20:29.920 --> 20:34.596
THE EGYPTIANS USED TO
SET THEIR CLOCKS BY HIM.

20:34.630 --> 20:36.120
OH, LOOK,
THERE'S GOES AN ASTEROID--

20:36.160 --> 20:37.491
COMET.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.690
IT'S WHAT THEY NAMED
THAT CLEANING SOLUTION AFTER.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.641
I KNOW, IT MAY STINK
WHEN YOU LEAVE IT IN THE SINK,

20:42.680 --> 20:44.944
BUT, BOY, OH, BOY,
DOES IT CLEAN.

20:44.980 --> 20:46.914
IS THERE A REASON
YOU'RE STANDING SO CLOSE TO ME?

20:46.950 --> 20:48.156
JUST LOOKING.

20:48.190 --> 20:49.009
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
THE GREAT THING

20:49.060 --> 20:50.049
ABOUT LOOKING.

20:50.090 --> 20:52.854
YOU CAN DO IT
FROM FAR, FAR AWAY.

20:52.900 --> 20:56.199
YEAH.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.299
AND NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

20:58.340 --> 21:01.207
I IMPLORE YOU TO ENJOY

21:01.250 --> 21:04.139
THE MAJESTY...

21:04.190 --> 21:14.236
OF THE HEAVENS.

21:14.240 --> 21:24.252
OF THE HEAVENS.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.477
HEY!
OH!

22:08.520 --> 22:09.475
YOU WORK HERE?

22:09.520 --> 22:11.317
NO, I JUST, UH...

22:11.350 --> 22:12.988
I JUST HAPPEN TO OWN
MY OWN SPACE SUIT.

22:13.030 --> 22:13.985
[LAUGHS]

22:14.030 --> 22:15.088
A SMART ASS.
I LIKE THAT.

22:15.130 --> 22:16.768
GET OVER HERE, KID.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.062
DO ME A FAVOR.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.192
KEEP YOUR FINGER
ON THIS SPACE BAR

22:19.240 --> 22:20.901
WHILE I ADJUST THIS.

22:20.940 --> 22:21.929
LIKE THIS?

22:21.980 --> 22:22.969
UH-HUH.

22:23.010 --> 22:24.238
YOU'RE GOING TO
TRUST ME WITH THIS?

22:24.280 --> 22:25.372
I DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF OTHER OPTIONS,

22:25.420 --> 22:31.620
DO I, SPACE MAN?

22:31.660 --> 22:32.922
I GOT TO BE
HONEST.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.996
THIS SEEMS LIKE A JOB FOR TWO,
NO?

22:35.030 --> 22:36.190
SOMETIMES
IT IS.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.798
BUT ONCE THE SCOPE IS IN PLACE,

22:37.840 --> 22:39.034
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS WATCH THE MONITOR,

22:39.080 --> 22:40.604
HOPING TO CATCH THINGS
THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.674
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'VE
GOT A PARTNER,

22:41.720 --> 22:42.812
YOU CAN SWITCH OFF,

22:42.850 --> 22:43.942
YOU KNOW, REST YOUR EYES,

22:43.990 --> 22:45.548
MAYBE MAKE CALCULATIONS
ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN,

22:45.590 --> 22:46.955
OR JUST...

22:46.990 --> 22:50.027
BREAK UP THE SILENCE
OF STARING INTO THE UNKNOWN.

22:50.060 --> 22:51.266
SO WHERE'S YOUR PARTNER?

22:51.300 --> 22:53.029
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S THE BAD PART OF IT.

22:53.070 --> 22:56.608
HE PASSED AWAY
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.868
YOU KNOW, THE BUDDHISTS
HAVE THIS SAYING

22:57.920 --> 23:00.980
ABOUT MOVING ON,
HONORING THE WORK,

23:01.020 --> 23:02.055
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT.

23:02.090 --> 23:02.749
WHAT I DO KNOW

23:02.760 --> 23:04.455
IS THAT I REALIZE
I'M TOO OLD

23:04.490 --> 23:06.253
TO BE DOING THIS
ALL ALONE.

23:06.300 --> 23:07.995
SO YOU'RE, UH...

23:08.040 --> 23:09.064
YOU'RE CONTINUING THE WORK, HUH?

23:09.100 --> 23:10.192
BRYANT WOULD RETURN
FROM THE GRAVE

23:10.240 --> 23:11.400
IF I DIDN'T.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.600
[CH UCKLES]

23:12.640 --> 23:13.800
YOU KNOW, WE PETITIONED
FOR FIVE YEARS

23:13.850 --> 23:14.874
FOR USE
OF THIS SCOPE,

23:14.910 --> 23:16.172
AND WE GOT LUCKY.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.256
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, DON'T TOUCH.

23:18.290 --> 23:19.757
ONCE YOU GET IN HERE,

23:19.790 --> 23:20.927
YOU GOT TO FIND WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FAST.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.188
WE HAD EIGHT MONTHS.

23:22.230 --> 23:24.528
BRYANT SAW SIX.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.935
EIGHT MONTHS SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD CHUNK OF TIME.

23:25.970 --> 23:27.562
NOT IN ASTRONOMY.

23:27.610 --> 23:30.238
SEE, ONCE YOU FIND IT,
YOU GOT TO TRACK IT,

23:30.280 --> 23:31.508
OKAY, AND THEN
IT'S NOT A DISCOVERY

23:31.550 --> 23:32.710
UNTIL YOU CHART IT,

23:32.750 --> 23:33.842
AND THEN
IT GOES AROUND AGAIN,

23:33.890 --> 23:34.879
AND THEN
YOU PROVE IT.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.922
MUST GET LONELY.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.029
I LET YOU IN HERE,
DIDN'T I?

23:38.060 --> 23:39.891
LOOK, I JUST...

23:39.930 --> 23:41.124
I TALK, YOU KNOW?

23:41.170 --> 23:42.432
I'VE GOT THE GIFT
OF THE GAB.

23:42.470 --> 23:44.870
JEEZ, I'LL TALK
TO ANYBODY, I SUPPOSE.

23:44.910 --> 23:47.276
SO YOU, UH...
YOU STILL HAVEN'T FOUND

23:47.310 --> 23:49.039
WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR, HUH?

23:49.080 --> 23:50.581
NO, BUT WHEN I DO,

23:50.620 --> 23:52.258
YOU'LL READ ABOUT IT,
BELIEVE ME.

23:52.290 --> 23:53.587
YOU'LL READ ABOUT IT.

23:53.630 --> 23:55.723
[JESSICA]: MY REAL GOAL
IS TO BECOME AN ASTRONOMER.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.625
SEE SOMETHING
NO ONE ELSE HAS.

23:57.670 --> 24:00.036
I DON'T NEED TO MAKE
A BIG, FLASHY DISCOVERY,

24:00.070 --> 24:02.504
OR NAME A STAR,
OR BECOME FAMOUS,

24:02.540 --> 24:03.905
LIKE MOST
OF THESE GUYS WANT.

24:03.950 --> 24:05.645
ALL I'VE EVER
REALLY WANTED

24:05.680 --> 24:06.886
IS TO KNOW
I MADE A DIFFERENCE.

24:06.920 --> 24:07.909
THAT'S GREAT.

24:07.960 --> 24:08.915
KNOWING WHAT
YOU WANTED TO DO

24:08.960 --> 24:10.086
SINCE YOU WERE A KID?

24:10.120 --> 24:11.087
THAT'S A GIFT.

24:11.130 --> 24:12.097
THAN KS.

24:12.130 --> 24:13.495
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
A GREAT LISTENER, GUS.

24:13.530 --> 24:15.259
OH, WELL, IT'S EASY
TO TALK TO YOU, JESSICA.

24:15.300 --> 24:16.289
I MEAN...

24:16.340 --> 24:17.864
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

24:17.910 --> 24:19.946
THEY'VE BEEN IN THERE
45 MINUTES.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.072
SO?

24:21.110 --> 24:23.487
IT'S
A FOUR-MINUTE SHOW.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.782
AND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

24:24.820 --> 24:27.220
IS PRECISELY WHY TIME TRAVEL
IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE,

24:27.260 --> 24:38.068
BUT MAY HAVE
ALREADY HAPPENED.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.372
[CHUCKLING]

24:40.420 --> 24:42.115
[SHAWN]:
SO I MET THE OTHER ASTRONOMER.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.889
NICE GUY, CHATTY.

24:43.930 --> 24:45.056
HIDING SOMETHING.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.158
SOMETHING NEFARIOUS?

24:46.200 --> 24:47.360
I DON'T KNOW YET.
HOW'D YOU DO?

24:47.400 --> 24:48.936
PLEASE, SHAWN.

24:48.970 --> 24:50.005
HOW DO YOU THINK?

24:50.040 --> 24:51.064
[GASPS]
DIGITS.

24:51.110 --> 24:52.134
YOU KNOW THIS.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.272
NICE!

24:53.310 --> 24:54.402
WE'RE GOING OUT
TOMORROW.

24:54.450 --> 24:55.576
IT'S ALL
COMING TOGETHER, MAN.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.871
JULIET CALLED.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.012
SHE RAN OUR DEAD GUY'S
PHONE RECORDS.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.084
WE GOT TO MEET HER
AT THE STATION.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.280
YOU BET.
LET'S GO.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.423
OH, NOT NOW.
5:00.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.495
WHY 5:00?

25:02.530 --> 25:05.260
GUS, I CAN'T JUST LEAVE
WILLY-NILLY

25:05.300 --> 25:06.437
WHENEVER I WANT.

25:06.470 --> 25:14.218
I HAVE A JOB TO DO HERE.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.558
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE CORONER SAYS.

25:15.590 --> 25:17.387
HEALTHY HEARTS
DO NOT JUST STOP.

25:17.430 --> 25:18.749
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:18.800 --> 25:20.449
I'VE GOT A GOLF BUDDY
WHO'S A CARDIOLOGIST.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.865
I'M GOING TO RUN THESE
BY HIM.

25:21.900 --> 25:26.109
MIND THE STORE.
I'LL BE BACK.

25:26.140 --> 25:28.005
HEY!

25:28.050 --> 25:31.110
OKAY, SO WE RAN THE HOME,
THE WORK,

25:31.150 --> 25:32.708
AND THE CELL PHONE
RECORDS OF BRYANT VALLERY.

25:32.760 --> 25:33.727
WE GOT NOTHING
ON THE HOME PHONE,

25:33.760 --> 25:35.159
A FEW STRANGE HITS
ON THE WORK LINE,

25:35.200 --> 25:36.258
BUT WHEN WE RAN
THE CELL PHONE,

25:36.300 --> 25:37.562
WE HIT THE JACKPOT.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.261
WE FOUND A NUMBER
THAT HE CALLS

25:39.300 --> 25:40.267
ONLY FROM
HIS CELL PHONE,

25:40.300 --> 25:41.267
ALL HOURS
OF THE NIGHT,

25:41.310 --> 25:42.277
WAY TOO OFTEN
FOR BUSINESS...

25:42.310 --> 25:43.868
UNLESS IT'S MONKEY BUSINESS.

25:43.910 --> 25:44.842
SWEET!

25:44.880 --> 25:45.710
SO WE CONTACTED
THE CELL COMPANY

25:45.750 --> 25:46.978
FOR THE NAME.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.442
THE NUMBER IS

25:48.490 --> 25:50.253
555-01...

25:50.290 --> 25:51.325
9...

25:51.360 --> 25:58.277
WELL, WHERE IS IT?

25:58.310 --> 26:00.198
OH, HERE IT IS.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.877
555-019--

26:01.910 --> 26:03.116
9?

26:03.120 --> 26:04.883
WOW, THAT'S GOOD.

26:04.920 --> 26:11.928
NOT REALLY.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.460
SO SHE HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH A MARRIED GUY,

26:13.510 --> 26:14.636
AND PROBABLY LIED ABOUT IT.

26:14.670 --> 26:15.978
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S GUILTY.

26:16.010 --> 26:17.102
SHAWN,
YOU'RE CONFUSING ME.

26:17.150 --> 26:18.344
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LOVES
TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS,

26:18.380 --> 26:19.472
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN
HOPPING TOWARD THIS ONE?

26:19.520 --> 26:20.839
HOPPING? IT DOESN'T
TRACK, GUS.

26:20.890 --> 26:21.914
WHY WOULD SHE
KILL HIM?

26:21.960 --> 26:22.915
SHE BROKE UP
WITH A GUY.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.052
IT'S HIM.
HE DUMPED HER.

26:24.090 --> 26:25.455
SO WHY DOESN'T
SHE MENTION TO YOU

26:25.490 --> 26:26.559
THAT HER EX-BOYFRIEND
JUST BIT THE DUST?

26:26.600 --> 26:27.760
WHAT IS SHE
GOING TO SAY?

26:27.800 --> 26:29.290
"HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
MY BOYFRIEND JUST DIED,

26:29.340 --> 26:30.364
"HE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN KILLED,

26:30.410 --> 26:31.809
MAYBE IT WAS ME.
HEE, HEE, HEE!"

26:31.840 --> 26:32.875
I DOUBT
SHE CHORTLES.

26:32.910 --> 26:34.400
MAN, SHE WAS SO DAMN
GOOD-LOOKING.

26:34.450 --> 26:35.974
AND SHE STILL IS.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.750
GUS, EVEN IF WE HAVE A WHO,
WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR MOTIVE,

26:38.790 --> 26:40.451
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE
THE METHOD.

26:40.490 --> 26:42.219
WE CAN'T GIVE UP
ON OUR OTHER SUSPECTS.

26:42.260 --> 26:46.139
WHAT WE NEED TO DO
IS KEEP LOOKING.

26:46.170 --> 26:48.104
YOU'RE GOING TO
SET OFF THE ALARM.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.437
CLEARLY, I HAVE A SECURITY PASS.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.469
THEY GAVE YOU
A SECURITY PASS?

26:50.510 --> 26:51.477
THEY GAVE DAVE
THE CHEDDAR CORN GUY

26:51.510 --> 26:52.943
A SECURITY PASS.

26:52.980 --> 26:54.743
I MERELY STUMBLED UPON IT
BY HAPPENSTANCE.

26:54.790 --> 26:56.257
AND BY "HAPPENSTANCE,"
YOU MEAN--

26:56.290 --> 26:57.723
I SWIPED IT FROM HIS GYM BAG

26:57.760 --> 26:59.227
WHILE HE WAS SHAKING A MILKY WAY
LOOSE FROM THE VENDING MACHINE.

26:59.260 --> 27:01.763
DAMMIT, I...

27:01.800 --> 27:03.233
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, SHAWN?

27:03.240 --> 27:05.299
WHAT I DON'T HAVE IS A KEY.

27:05.340 --> 27:06.329
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
WHAT?

27:06.380 --> 27:07.506
I'M SORRY.

27:07.550 --> 27:08.972
I JUST, I LEFT MY
POGO STICK IN THERE,

27:09.020 --> 27:10.442
AND I JUST--

27:10.480 --> 27:11.617
NO, I MEAN
YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT.

27:11.660 --> 27:12.809
YOU GOT TO MOVE UPWARD

27:12.860 --> 27:13.656
IF YOU WANT TO GET THE LATCH
TO DISENGAGE.

27:13.690 --> 27:16.352
LET ME DO IT.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.732
DON'T YOU HAVE A KEY
FOR THAT?

27:18.770 --> 27:19.930
FOR THIS ROOM?
NO.

27:19.970 --> 27:21.062
BIG BAD BRYANT
TOOK IT AWAY

27:21.110 --> 27:22.236
A FEW WEEKS
AFTER THEY GOT HERE.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.406
WHY?

27:23.450 --> 27:26.078
A FEW SMALL ITEMS GO MISSING,

27:26.120 --> 27:27.109
SUDDENLY
EVERYONE GETS SUSPICIOUS.

27:27.150 --> 27:29.414
ITEMS SUCH AS...

27:29.460 --> 27:31.519
A WATCH, A COMB, SOME MAIL.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.652
WHOSE MAIL?

27:32.700 --> 27:33.769
THE DEAD GUY,
BRYANT.

27:33.800 --> 27:34.789
DID YOU READ IT?

27:34.830 --> 27:36.263
WELL, OF COURSE I DID.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.460
YOU KNOW,
HE BECAME QUITE A JERK.

27:37.510 --> 27:39.432
I DON'T KNOW
IF HUGO KNOWS THIS OR NOT,

27:39.480 --> 27:42.199
BUT HE WAS DISSOLVING
THE PARTNERSHIP.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.979
APPARENTLY, HE HAD
SOME BIG PLANS FOR HIMSELF.

27:44.020 --> 27:47.581
CORRESPONDENCE FOR JOBS
HE DIDN'T SEEM QUALIFIED FOR,

27:47.630 --> 27:49.951
LIKE HEADING
UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.319
AT NASA...
NASA?

27:51.370 --> 27:53.759
NOW, WHO ARE
YOU GUYS AGAIN?

27:53.810 --> 27:56.574
WE THINK SOMETHING BAD
WENT DOWN IN THERE.

27:56.610 --> 28:01.741
YES, SOMETHING BAD
DID GO DOWN IN HERE.

28:01.790 --> 28:03.348
DID YOU SEE
ANYTHING?

28:03.360 --> 28:06.249
NO, BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE DEAD GUY, HE CHANGED.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.426
THEY WERE FRIENDS
AT THE BEGINNING.

28:07.470 --> 28:10.098
HUGO WAS ALWAYS
BEING NICE TO HIM, YOU KNOW.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.131
HUGO'S THE ONLY ONE AROUND
HERE WHO'S NICE TO ME.

28:12.180 --> 28:14.444
HE BRINGS ME COFFEE
IN THE MORNINGS,

28:14.480 --> 28:15.504
ALTHOUGH HE BRINGS IT

28:15.550 --> 28:17.142
FOR EVERYBODY.

28:17.190 --> 28:18.248
ALL FOUR OF US.

28:18.290 --> 28:19.257
THREE OF US.

28:19.290 --> 28:20.257
STALLINGS,
I'LL BE NICE TO YOU,

28:20.290 --> 28:21.723
JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.523
STOP STEALING THE GUM
OUT OF MY LOCKER, OKAY?

28:23.570 --> 28:25.265
[LAUGHS AWKWARDLY]

28:25.300 --> 28:26.437
YOU SPOTTED THAT?

28:26.470 --> 28:27.903
SURE DID.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.271
HEY, UH...

28:29.310 --> 28:30.470
DO YOU KNOW
HOW THESE BOOKS WORKED?

28:30.510 --> 28:32.978
OH, THEY SWITCHED UP
EVERY COUPLE HOURS.

28:33.020 --> 28:34.282
ONE LOOKS,
ONE WRITES.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.753
YOU KNOW, THEY DO IT
FROM DARK TILL DUSK

28:35.790 --> 28:36.882
ALL THE TIME.

28:36.930 --> 28:38.158
HUGO'S HERE.

28:38.190 --> 28:39.828
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

28:39.860 --> 28:41.464
AH, HE GETS HERE
AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.138
YOU COULD SET
YOUR CLOCK TO IT.

28:43.170 --> 28:45.229
UM, HEY, YOU SHOULD HURRY.

28:45.270 --> 28:46.271
YOU DON'T HAVE LONG.

28:46.310 --> 28:47.277
THANKS, DUDE.

28:47.310 --> 28:53.112
UH-HUH.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.650
GUS, COME
CHECK THIS OUT.

28:54.690 --> 28:55.896
LOOK, THERE'S A PAGE MISSING
FROM THIS LOG BOOK.

28:55.930 --> 28:56.919
I NOTICED IT
THE FIRST TIME I WAS HERE.

28:56.970 --> 28:59.131
LOOK.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.694
JUNE 215t.

29:00.740 --> 29:01.729
WHAT DOES
THE BOOK TRACK?

29:01.770 --> 29:02.839
IT'S LIKE
STALLINGS SAID.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.007
IT'S, LIKE, EVERY MANUAL
ADJUSTMENT THEY MAKE,

29:05.050 --> 29:06.210
WHO DOES IT,

29:06.250 --> 29:07.615
WHICH GUY
WAS ON THE SCOPE.

29:07.650 --> 29:08.685
SEE, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY SWITCH SHIFTS

29:08.720 --> 29:09.857
ABOUT EVERY
TWO HOURS, RIGHT?

29:09.890 --> 29:11.221
SO WHY REMOVE
THIS PAGE?

29:11.260 --> 29:14.366
YOU GO FROM 8:39 WITH HUGO
TO 10:42 WITH BRYANT,

29:14.400 --> 29:15.560
SO THE QUESTION IS,

29:15.600 --> 29:18.637
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN 8:39 AND 10:42

29:18.670 --> 29:19.898
ON JUNE let?

29:19.940 --> 29:21.168
SOME BAD JUJU.

29:21.210 --> 29:22.370
WE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

29:22.410 --> 29:23.911
WHY?

29:23.950 --> 29:25.440
WHY?
GUS...

29:25.490 --> 29:26.514
IF SOMEONE
FINDS ME IN HERE,

29:26.560 --> 29:29.654
I COULD GET FIRED.

29:29.700 --> 29:33.067
WHY DO YOU KEEP RUNNING
LIKE THAT?

29:33.100 --> 29:34.237
HEY, YOU GUYS.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.500
UM, HEY,
WHAT'S UP?

29:36.540 --> 29:38.098
GUS, ABOUT TONIGHT...

29:38.150 --> 29:39.412
OH, IF YOU HAVE
OTHER OBLIGATIONS, THAT'S COOL.

29:39.450 --> 29:40.439
NO, I JUST
WANTED TO SEE

29:40.480 --> 29:41.788
IF WE COULD GO AT 6:30 INSTEAD.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.958
THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

29:44.990 --> 29:47.094
LOOK, I NEED TO BORROW
YOUR MOTORCYCLE TONIGHT.

29:47.130 --> 29:48.893
YOU CAN USE
MY LITTLE BLUE CAR.
OOH, YEAH,

29:48.940 --> 29:49.895
DO THAT, GUS.

29:49.940 --> 29:51.464
I GET A LITTLE NERVOUS
ON MOTORCYCLES.

29:51.510 --> 29:52.977
SETTLED. BYE, JESS!

29:53.010 --> 29:55.979
BYE.

29:56.020 --> 30:00.411
[SIGHS]

30:00.460 --> 30:01.757
[HUGO]: I THINK
YOU ARE THIS ONE.

30:01.790 --> 30:03.451
WHAT'S THAT
IN HIS CASE?

30:03.500 --> 30:04.990
TRACKING READOUTS.

30:05.030 --> 30:07.305
DUDE, IT'S JUST
A BUNCH OF PAPERWORK.

30:07.340 --> 30:09.137
I SAW IT
AT THE OBSERVATORY.

30:09.180 --> 30:10.477
WHY DOES HE KEEP IT
LOCKED UP LIKE THAT?

30:10.510 --> 30:11.772
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.573
MORNING, GENTLEMEN!
YOU OFF ALREADY?

30:13.620 --> 30:14.746
I HAD TO CHECK
THE TIMERS

30:14.790 --> 30:16.018
ON THE CRAB SPRAY.

30:16.060 --> 30:17.084
YOU NEED ANY HELP
WITH THAT GIANT THING?

30:17.130 --> 30:18.757
NAH, I CAN MANAGE IT.

30:18.790 --> 30:20.758
ONLY GOT TWO MORE WEEKS OF THIS
BEFORE MY TIME'S UP.

30:20.800 --> 30:24.406
MIGHT AS WELL
FOLLOW IT THROUGH TO THE END.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.032
YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.399
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.873
THAT MEANS HE'S NOT
AT HIS HOUSE.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.956
SO?

30:31.990 --> 30:34.254
RAINIER'S NOT EXACTLY
A HIGH ROLLER, HUH?

30:34.290 --> 30:35.427
NOPE.
LOOK AT THAT.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.264
I GOT A DATE ON FRIDAY.

37:35.300 --> 37:36.221
CAN YOU DO SATURDAY?

37:36.270 --> 37:37.669
NEVER MIND.

37:37.710 --> 37:39.507
DIGITALIS IS PRESCRIBED
FOR HEART CONDITIONS.

37:39.540 --> 37:41.474
HOW'S THAT HELP US?

37:41.510 --> 37:43.011
IT CAN CAUSE TOXICITY IN SOMEONE
WITHOUT A HEART PROBLEM.

37:43.050 --> 37:44.517
WOULDN'T THAT SHOW UP
ON AN AUTOPSY?

37:44.550 --> 37:45.619
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

37:45.650 --> 37:46.480
YOU HAVE TO TEST
FOR DIGITALIS SPECIFICALLY.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.420
NO ONE WOULD CONSIDER IT

37:48.460 --> 37:49.427
IN SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE
A HISTORY OF HEART PROBLEMS.

HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

37:54.200 --> 37:55.838
WE JUST GOT OUR MOTIVE
FOR MURDER, SPENCER.

37:55.870 --> 37:56.939
HUGO FOUND OUT

37:56.980 --> 37:58.004
THAT VALLERY WAS GOING TO
TAKE ALL THE CREDIT

37:58.050 --> 37:59.870
FOR THEIR DISCOVERY
HIMSELF.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.478
CUT HIM OUT OF IT ENTIRELY.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.215
BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE SCOPE
WHEN THEY MADE THE FIND.

38:03.260 --> 38:04.557
YES. MAYBE.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.289
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:06.330 --> 38:07.490
WELL, WE HEARD
YOU HAD THE MOTIVE,

38:07.530 --> 38:09.191
SO WE RUSHED DOWN HERE
TO VOLUNTEER.

38:09.230 --> 38:11.289
THANKS,
BUT I'LL TAKE THIS ONE MYSELF.

38:11.340 --> 38:13.399
OKAY, BUT AT LEAST TELL ME
ABOUT THE POISON.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.408
WHAT POISON? I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT POISON.

38:15.450 --> 38:16.644
YOU MOST CERTAINLY DID.

38:16.680 --> 38:17.612
I HEARD IT.
CLEAR AS DAY.

38:17.650 --> 38:19.288
MUST HAVE SLIPPED OUT.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.856
I HAVE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT POISON AS A METHOD,

38:20.890 --> 38:22.926
BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.064
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO READ
YOUR INNERMOST THOUGHTS?

38:25.100 --> 38:28.160
LIKE, DEEP, DEEP, DEEP ONES?

38:28.210 --> 38:30.132
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

38:30.180 --> 38:31.204
OKAY.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.343
I JUST WANT YOU
TO RELAX,

38:32.380 --> 38:33.449

HUGO'S HOUSE.

38:45.170 --> 38:46.603

OF GETTING A WARRANT.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.039
WHAT'D HE SAY?

38:48.080 --> 38:49.342
HE'S IN THE PROCESS
OF GETTING A WARRANT NOW.

38:49.380 --> 38:51.519

CHECK THE GARDEN.

38:51.550 --> 38:52.710
IT'S BURIED THERE?

38:52.760 --> 38:54.614
SOMETHING'S GROWING.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.150
OH, I'M GETTING SOMETHING...

39:06.080 --> 39:08.617

39:18.070 --> 39:19.037
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

39:19.070 --> 39:20.731
WE RAN
A TOXICOLOGY REPORT.

39:20.780 --> 39:21.906
THERE'S NO TRACE
OF POISON.

39:21.950 --> 39:23.508
OF COURSE.

39:23.550 --> 39:24.676
THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.210
SO WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS

39:26.250 --> 39:28.059

TO ADMINISTER IT

39:28.090 --> 39:29.318
VERY, VERY SLOWLY.

YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

BE THE TEA.
