There's 100,000 streets in this city.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.600
You don't need to know the route.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.300
You give me a time and a place,

01:54.400 --> 01:56.600
I give you a five-minute window.

01:57.300 --> 02:01.100
Anything happens in that
five minutes and I'm yours.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.700
No matter what.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.700
Anything happens a
minute either side of that

02:05.800 --> 02:07.700
and you're on your own.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.000
Do you understand?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.100
Good.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.600
And you won't be able to
reach me on this phone again.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.300
Hey, there you are!

02:55.500 --> 02:57.300

02:57.500 --> 02:59.800

02:59.900 --> 03:02.500
but I dropped in 300
horses on the inside,

03:02.600 --> 03:04.100
she is going to fly.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.900
You look like a zombie, kid.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.799
You getting any sleep?

03:08.800 --> 03:13.599
Can I offer you some Benzedrine,
Dexedrine, caffeine, nicotine?

03:13.600 --> 03:15.300
You don't smoke. That's right.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.800
Better off.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.600
There she is!

03:20.800 --> 03:25.200

car in the Stale of California.

minutes from that location.

Hey, kid, you know what?

14:28.400 --> 14:29.700
Director wants to see a roll over.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.200
Are you okay with that?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.600
Remember, if you don't feel
good, just abort the shot.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.800
There's no shame in that, all right?

14:35.900 --> 14:37.600
I mean, you're... You're
doubling for the star.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.400
You're not like a day
player or anything.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.700
And I got you 500 more.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.700
Of course, we split that.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.500
You okay? Ready to go?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.600
All right. Counting on you!

15:03.400 --> 15:05.500
Excuse me, pal. I just
need a minute here.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.899
Before I put you on camera, I
need you to sign this contract.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.900
It just basically releases
liability to the company

15:10.901 --> 15:14.200
in case you die, get
maimed, or seriously injured.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.300
And action!

15:24.700 --> 15:26.400
All right, that's a cut!

15:26.500 --> 15:28.200
Kid! That was fantastic!

15:28.300 --> 15:29.800
Just fantastic.

15:29.900 --> 15:32.700
Okay. How you doing? You all right?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.500
You were good. You were
good. That was perfect.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.000
- You're a monkey.
- No, you're the monkey.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.400
You're the monkey. You're the monkey.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
No, you're the monkey.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.600
Hey, tell me one thing.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.200
I love you. I love you.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.600
Where should I put this? In the kitchen.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.100
Thank you.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.100
Just be a second.

17:52.900 --> 17:53.900
Scary.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.000
Hey, you want a tooth pick?

18:06.300 --> 18:08.299
You want a glass of water?

18:08.300 --> 18:09.300
Okay.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.600
Thanks.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.900
So, you just moved to LA?

18:29.500 --> 18:31.600
No, I've been here for a while.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.800
You're just new here?

18:41.100 --> 18:43.000
That's Benicio's father.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.300
Where is he?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.800
He's in prison.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.600
What do you do?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.500
I drive.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.400
Like a limo driver?

19:02.300 --> 19:04.000
No, like, for movies.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.400
You mean, all the car chases and stuff?

19:09.600 --> 19:10.700
Yeah.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.400
Is that dangerous?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.000
It's only part-time.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.000
Mostly I work at a garage.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.300
Where?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.300
Reseda Boulevard.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.300
I gotta go.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.400
Okay.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.500
Thanks for the water.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.400
- Say bye.
- Bye.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.200
Mr. Rose, your food, sir.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.400
Okay.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.600
Chicken chow mein and some Peking duck.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.000
Okay. Where are the chopsticks?

20:37.100 --> 20:39.399
You Know. The guy just...

20:39.400 --> 20:40.900
Go get them. Go get them.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.900
I don't want that. I don't
want that. You eat it.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.500
Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.500
Put out the fucking
cigarette. I'm eating.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.400
Sorry.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.400
What's the matter with you?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.700
I'm just...

20:53.900 --> 20:55.500
What happened to all the
ashtrays in this town?

20:56.900 --> 20:58.600
You run a perfectly good business.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.500
I don't know why you wanna change now?

21:00.900 --> 21:03.800
You know how much my
business made last year?

21:04.100 --> 21:05.300
Thirty grand.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.500
I can build a car in six months

21:07.600 --> 21:10.399
and in six seconds, these
jerks write it off as a stunt

21:10.400 --> 21:11.900
that won't even make it into the movie.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.400
See, all I need is a
hard used stock car.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.800
That's all.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.800
And I figure we start off with small
town circuit and we work our way up.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.800
And once we get to the
show, we're talking millions.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.399
I have the chopsticks, sir. Yeah.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.700
Where's the cookies?

21:27.800 --> 21:30.400
You know, I...
Forget it. Forget it.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.400
So, you still haven't given me a number.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.500
All right.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.500
$430,000.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.000
Mr. Rose, I wouldn't
come to you with this

21:41.100 --> 21:43.900
unless I was absolutely sure about it.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.700
How can you be sure, Shannon?

21:46.100 --> 21:49.000
What do you got that the big
professional race teams don't?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.600
I got the driver.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.200
You just told me they
had half a dozen drivers.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.700
Not like this one.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.000
This kid is special.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.500
I've been working with him for a while.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.700
I've never seen anything like it.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.500
If I had the money, I'd back him myself.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.100
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.500
Mr. Rose, you put this
kid behind the wheel,

22:12.200 --> 22:13.900
there's nothing he can't do.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.300
There's money here. You can't lose.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Fuck you eating chink food
in my fucking restaurant?

22:20.400 --> 22:22.900
What's a Jew doing running a pizzeria?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.600
You remember Shannon.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.700
Take a fucking hike. I
want to talk to my partner.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.600
I'm just fucking with you.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.300
How you doing, Shannon?
How's the fucking leg?

22:40.100 --> 22:41.600
I paid my debt.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.200
I'll think about it. Okay?

22:46.800 --> 22:48.500
But I want to meet the kid first.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.700
That's all I ask.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.400
Come on, I want you to meet somebody.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.700
And whatever you do like about
the car, don't say anything.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.099
I want to drive the
price down a little bit.

23:10.100 --> 23:12.900
Kid, I want you to meet Mr. Bernie Rose.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.300
Nice to meet you.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.400
My hands are a little dirty.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.900
So are mine.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.300
Good driving out there.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.400
Thanks.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.000
He's a good kid.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.700
So, what do you think?
Do we get the 400?

23:41.300 --> 23:44.000
I'll give you 300 for 70%.

23:46.700 --> 23:47.800
Done.

23:50.100 --> 23:51.500
Right. Good.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.800
You won't be sorry.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.099
I'm Shannon. Hi. Irene.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.700
Irene. How can I help you?

24:03.800 --> 24:05.100
It just broke down.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.899
Just broke down. Just like that.

24:06.900 --> 24:08.200
- You want me to take a look at it?
- Yes, please.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.900
All right.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.700
We got all our bays full.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.600
Hey, pal, just drop it down here.

24:13.700 --> 24:14.700
We'll push it in, all right?

24:15.200 --> 24:18.100
We want to push her into number three.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.100
The car, not you. On, good.

24:20.700 --> 24:21.700
Hi. Hi.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.400
You two know each other?

24:25.500 --> 24:26.600
Don't.

24:26.700 --> 24:27.900
Look at that.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
We're neighbors.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.300
Neighbors? Very good.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.900
Well, we'll try to be neighborly too.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.300
You blinked.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.100
What?

24:57.100 --> 24:58.300
Can I call a cab from here?

24:58.400 --> 24:59.800
Yeah. Sure.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.900
What am I talking about?

25:03.200 --> 25:04.900
You and the kid are neighbors, right?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.699
He can take you home. No.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.100
I'd feel bad. No, no.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.600
Don't even think twice about it.

25:09.601 --> 25:12.900
He'd be happy to do it. He's a good guy.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.200
You know, he walked into my shop
here about five or six years ago.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.400
Right out of the blue.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.200
Asking for a job.

25:21.300 --> 25:24.500
So I put him to the test
to see what he could do.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.100
The kid's amazing. Yeah.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.500
So, I hire him on the spot,

25:28.600 --> 25:30.200
Boom.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.200
At about half the wages I normally pay.

25:32.300 --> 25:33.600
He didn't blink an eye.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.600
Hey, kid, come over here
for a second, will you?

25:37.700 --> 25:41.000
And I have been
exploiting him ever since.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.400
Don't tell him.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.999
Looks like we have a bigger
problem than I thought.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.500
And we're going to have to keep
the car here for a few days.

25:51.600 --> 25:55.200
So I offered your services to
take Benicio and Irene home.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.900
Would that be okay?

25:59.800 --> 26:01.000
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.900
I don't have wheels on my car.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.399
Okay.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.200
It's one thing you should know about me.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.500
Well, put the tires on.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.400
You got five minutes? Yeah.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.100
Hey, do you want to see something?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.000
Yeah.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.400
Okay.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.200
♪ Back against the wall and odds.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.300
He had a good time.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.100
Me, too.

29:04.300 --> 29:07.200
Sorry if I put you on the
spot showing up like that.

29:07.300 --> 29:08.600
It's okay.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.900
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.600
If you want a ride or something.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.800
Don't worry about her bumps and
bruises, that's just fiberglass.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.300
That's easily replaceable.

31:20.301 --> 31:23.299
Put a coat of paint on
there, some sponsor decals.

31:23.300 --> 31:25.799
Look at the tread on the
tire's still good, huh?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.400
We're in business.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.200
We paid 300 fucking grand
for this piece of shit?

31:31.300 --> 31:34.200
I paid for it. Out of my own pocket.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.800
This is just the shell.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.300
It's the inside that
counts, not the outside.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.900
- Right, Shannon?
- You are correct, sir.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.898
Fuck that shit. I pay 300 for something,

31:41.899 --> 31:43.400
I want everybody to fucking see it.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.300
Of course you do.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.200
Now, this.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.800
That is one motherfucking fine-ass
pussy mobile, motherfucker.

31:52.300 --> 31:53.300
Damn!

31:54.100 --> 31:55.800
Shannon, sell him the car.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.500
He wouldn't be able to
find pussy in a whorehouse.

31:59.800 --> 32:03.600
You know what? This car will
even make you good-looking.

32:03.700 --> 32:05.200
I'm already good-looking, pal.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.400
How's it going?

32:10.100 --> 32:11.900
When's our first race?

32:13.200 --> 32:14.800
Pretty soon.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.700
You gonna be ready?

32:19.500 --> 32:20.700
I hope so.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.000
"I hope so."

32:23.400 --> 32:26.700
Hey, no false modesty. I
got a lot of money in this.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.600
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.499
No.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.300
I used to produce movies.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.700
In the '80s.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
Kind of like action films. Sexy stuff.

32:40.100 --> 32:42.200
One critic called them European.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.300
I thought they were shit.

32:44.600 --> 32:48.199
Anyway, he arranged all the
cars for me. Did all the stunts.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.300
I liked him. I liked having him around.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.700
Even though he overcharged
the shit out of me.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.200
His next business venture,

32:56.400 --> 32:58.999
he got involved with
some of Nino's friends.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.399
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.700
They broke his pelvis.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.500
He's never had a lot of luck.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.000
The reason I'm telling you this

33:09.001 --> 33:11.600
is that he has a lot invested in you.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.300
And so do I.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.600
So anything you need, you call me.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.900
We're a team now.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.100
I'm excited.

33:23.300 --> 33:26.100
Nino, let's get the fuck out of here.

33:41.800 --> 33:42.900
Is he a bad guy?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.200
Yeah.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.500
How can you tell?

33:46.900 --> 33:49.900
Because he's a shark.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.500
There's no good sharks?

33:52.600 --> 33:55.600
No. I mean, just look at him.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.500
Does he look like a good guy to you?

34:00.700 --> 34:02.100
Hi. How are you?

34:02.200 --> 34:03.800
Good. How are you? Good.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.000
This is Cindy.

34:11.900 --> 34:12.900
Hi.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.000
That was my husbands lawyer.

34:54.900 --> 34:57.000
He's coming home in a week.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.500
♪ I don't eat.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.999
♪ I don't sleep.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.500
♪ I do nothing but think of you.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.799
♪ I don't eat.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.000
♪ I don't sleep.

36:04.100 --> 36:07.100

36:09.800 --> 36:16.600
♪ You keep me under your spell.

36:20.600 --> 36:26.400
We're here celebrating, but
it's a shameful thing what I did.

36:28.600 --> 36:32.200
And I have a lot of making
up to do to everyone.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.500
But second chances are rare.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.600
Right?

36:43.600 --> 36:46.100
And that's worth celebrating. Right?

36:48.300 --> 36:52.700
So I want to make a toast
to that lady right there.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.300
Thanks for staying. I love you, Innie.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.400
Salut.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.300
♪ I don't sleep.

37:03.400 --> 37:07.400
♪ I do nothing but think of you.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.999
♪ I don't eat.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.400
♪ I don't sleep.

37:12.500 --> 37:16.500

37:17.800 --> 37:24.800
♪ You keep me under your spell.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.400
♪ You keep me under your spell.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.000
♪ You keep me under your spell.

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
Hey.

38:17.100 --> 38:18.100
Hi.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.700
Sorry about the noise.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.600
I was going to call the cops.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.700
I wish you would.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.100
You're getting heavier.

38:44.300 --> 38:45.400
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:48.300 --> 38:49.800
Hey.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.100
How you doing?

38:53.600 --> 38:56.700
Hi. This guy's been
telling me a lot about you.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.000
Says you been coming
around, helping out a lot.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.800
Yeah? Helping out?

39:02.900 --> 39:04.000
Is that right?

39:05.500 --> 39:08.000
Is that right?

39:10.300 --> 39:13.300
That's very nice. That's
nice of you. Thank you.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.200
You're welcome.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.200
You drive for the movies?

39:21.400 --> 39:22.500
Yeah.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.700
I can take that. No, no, no. I got it.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.800
Let Mommy talk to her friend.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.600
Come on.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.300
Have a good night.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.900
You're Shannon's buddy, right?

40:37.000 --> 40:38.600
We met last year.

40:40.100 --> 40:43.300
You drove me and my brother
back from Palm Springs.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.700
We hired another wheelman.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.000
I spent six months in jail.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.500
My brother, he got himself Killed.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.299
I got this sweet job coming up.

40:58.300 --> 40:59.900
How about this?

41:00.300 --> 41:02.099
You shut your mouth.

41:02.100 --> 41:06.200
Or I'll kick your teeth down your
throat and I'll shut it for you.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.100
Nice seeing you again.

42:31.700 --> 42:33.800
Come on, it's okay.

42:33.900 --> 42:37.800
Come here. Don't be scared.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.500
Don't tell Mommy, okay?

42:46.200 --> 42:48.700
Okay? It's a secret between the boys.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.100
Fuck me.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.700
Who were they?

43:54.100 --> 43:55.900
What the fuck are you going to do?

43:56.000 --> 43:57.900
You're gonna go beat them up for me?

43:58.400 --> 43:59.900
Huh, stunt guy?

44:01.100 --> 44:04.200
Why the fuck do you want
to know who they are?

44:05.300 --> 44:06.400
Huh?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
There are some guys that
want me to do a job for them

44:18.100 --> 44:20.000
and I'm not going to do it.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.800
That's who they are.

44:24.100 --> 44:25.700
What's the job?

44:27.000 --> 44:29.800
They want me to rob a
pawnshop in the Valley.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.700
Why?

44:33.300 --> 44:36.100
'Cause I owe them some protection
money from when I was inside.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.800
It's 2,000 bucks.

44:38.900 --> 44:41.700
But as soon as I got
out, oh, it's 5,000 bucks.

44:41.800 --> 44:44.600
No, actually, it's $10,000. $20,000.

44:44.700 --> 44:48.000
Tomorrow I don't know what
the fuck it's going to be.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.800
What are you going to do?

44:52.300 --> 44:54.500
That's a really good question.

44:57.200 --> 45:01.000
They said they were going to
come after Benicio and Irene next.

45:22.900 --> 45:24.200
You okay?

45:25.900 --> 45:28.000
You want something to drink?

45:31.700 --> 45:33.700
What is that you got there?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.300
Can I see?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.100
One of those men gave you that?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.100
They told me not to lose it.

46:01.900 --> 46:04.099
You want me to keep that for you?

46:04.100 --> 46:05.200
Okay.

46:30.700 --> 46:32.100
How's Benice?

46:32.900 --> 46:34.100
Good.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.300
You just saying that?

46:39.400 --> 46:40.500
No.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.300
What do you mean?

46:47.800 --> 46:52.200
I saw that Standard was in an accident.

46:53.500 --> 46:54.500
Yeah.

46:58.300 --> 46:59.800
What happened?

47:03.600 --> 47:05.100
He got beat up.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.500
Why?

47:12.200 --> 47:13.700
Just drunk kids.

47:25.900 --> 47:27.700
You should come over.

47:30.300 --> 47:32.400
You should come and see him.

47:39.400 --> 47:42.100
You want to... You want to hear a story?

47:42.200 --> 47:44.300
Do you want to hear how
Mommy and me met? Yeah.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.800
Yeah? Okay.

47:48.700 --> 47:52.200
We were at a party. And
she was 19 years old.

47:52.300 --> 47:53.599
Seventeen.

47:53.600 --> 47:54.900
You weren't 17. I was.

47:55.700 --> 47:57.500
- Wow. So it was illegal?
- Yeah.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.500
All right. So I illegally walked
over to a 17-year-old girl.

48:05.700 --> 48:08.500
And I walk up and I say, "Hello, Miss."

48:09.900 --> 48:11.899
"What is your name?"

48:11.900 --> 48:14.500
And she didn't say
anything. And then I said., .

48:14.900 --> 48:17.400
"Well, my name is Standard Gabriel."

48:18.300 --> 48:19.500
Then what did you say?

48:24.800 --> 48:26.500
I said...

48:27.800 --> 48:29.300
"Where is the deluxe version?"

48:35.900 --> 48:37.900
She's good, man.

48:38.100 --> 48:39.200
Sharp.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.200
Man. It killed me.

48:45.700 --> 48:48.000
And then a year later,
you popped out, man.

48:54.300 --> 48:56.600
It was the best day of my life.

49:41.300 --> 49:43.100
If drive for you, you get your money.

49:43.500 --> 49:45.500
You tell me where we
start, where we're going,

49:45.600 --> 49:46.900
where we're going afterwards.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.700
I give you five minutes
when we get there.

49:49.500 --> 49:51.900
Anything happens in that
five minutes, and I'm yours.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.299
No matter what.

49:53.300 --> 49:56.400
Anything a minute on either side
of that and you're on your own.

49:56.500 --> 49:58.700
I don't sit in while
you're running it down.

49:58.800 --> 50:00.599
I don't carry a gun.

50:00.600 --> 50:01.700
I drive.

50:03.100 --> 50:04.600
You look like you're hard to work with.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Not if we understand each other.

50:08.600 --> 50:10.200
What's to understand?

50:10.800 --> 50:12.599
I can't do this thing alone.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.000
You got Blanche.

50:14.100 --> 50:15.300
Come on, man.

50:17.200 --> 50:18.900
She's beautiful. Look at her.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.700
What the fuck you
rolling your eyes at for?

50:26.200 --> 50:27.800
You know what, get the fuck out of here.

50:27.801 --> 50:28.900
Get up!

50:29.000 --> 50:31.700
Standard, take her with you
and go get her a fucking coke!

50:38.500 --> 50:40.500
Okay, here's the deal.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.900
This much for Blanche,

50:45.400 --> 50:48.000
this much for that asshole,
minus what he owes me,

50:49.900 --> 50:52.200
and this much for you.

50:55.900 --> 50:57.700
You still interested?

51:00.100 --> 51:02.200
Good. Anything else?

51:03.800 --> 51:06.600
When you get your
money, his debt's paid.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.100
He's out for good.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.400
And you never go near his family again.

51:12.700 --> 51:14.200
You understand?

51:18.500 --> 51:20.000
I'm here with my family.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.200
And my new friend.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.400
And...

51:25.700 --> 51:27.500
Toast to the future.

51:29.900 --> 51:31.200
To our future.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.500
Hey.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.100
I'll see you in five minutes.

52:04.300 --> 52:05.600
I'll see you in four.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
My...

55:10.200 --> 55:11.200
Shit!

55:13.700 --> 55:14.700
My God!

56:44.700 --> 56:46.900
How much did Cook say
we were going to get?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.400
Forty grand.

57:00.800 --> 57:02.100
Stay here.

57:21.600 --> 57:24.000
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

57:27.400 --> 57:29.300
Can you answer the question?

57:31.200 --> 57:32.500
Ma'am.

57:39.300 --> 57:40.300
Hello?

57:40.400 --> 57:42.300
Benicio? Is that you?

57:42.600 --> 57:43.700
Yeah.

57:43.800 --> 57:46.300
-Hey.
-Hi.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.899
Is your mother there?

57:48.900 --> 57:52.600
She's sitting down
talking to the police.

57:54.300 --> 57:57.100
Okay, just tell her I'm
going to call her back, okay?

57:57.200 --> 57:58.500
Okay, bye.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.900
In related news, an attempted
robbery turned tragic today

58:05.000 --> 58:08.400
when the owner of a local pawnshop
opened fire on an intruder.

58:08.500 --> 58:11.000
The armed robber was
pronounced dead at the scene.

58:11.100 --> 58:14.800
He has been identified as Standard
Gabriel of Echo Park, Los Angeles.

58:15.300 --> 58:17.799
Other details are unclear,
but the owner of the pawnshop

58:17.800 --> 58:20.400
told reporters that Gabriel acted alone

58:20.500 --> 58:22.300
and that no money had been stolen.

58:23.100 --> 58:26.000
In other news, four high
school athletes were arrested...

58:46.200 --> 58:48.600
If he saw you take the money

58:49.700 --> 58:51.600
and he saw you get in the car,

58:53.700 --> 58:55.700
then why didn't he say anything?

58:57.500 --> 58:59.000
I have no idea.

59:10.700 --> 59:13.200
Did you have any idea
there'd be a second car?

59:18.700 --> 59:20.900
I already told you everything.

59:26.600 --> 59:29.000
Now, you just got a
little boy's father killed.

59:30.300 --> 59:32.100
And you almost got us killed.

59:33.100 --> 59:34.500
And now you're lying to me.

59:35.900 --> 59:38.100
So, how about this?

59:38.200 --> 59:42.700
From now on, every word out
of your mouth is the truth.

59:44.500 --> 59:46.300
Or I'm going to hurt you.

59:47.700 --> 59:49.200
Do you understand?

59:50.400 --> 59:52.300
Now what did Cook tell you?

59:54.200 --> 59:56.700
He said there'd be
another car to hold us up,

59:56.800 --> 59:59.099
but he didn't say anything
about all this money.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.200
He didn't say anything
about anyone getting killed.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.200
You were going to rip us off?

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.800
What's his real name?

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.700
He says it's Chris, but
I just call him Cook.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.900
You're going to take
me to him right now.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.800
Do you understand?

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.300
Yes.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.100
Easy. Easy.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.500
What did you do with the cash?

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.900
'Cause I could keep it safe for you...

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.700
Will you just stop it?

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.700
This guy Cook, does he have a real name?

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.100
Chris.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.800
Maybe.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.000
I'll ask Bernie. See if he knows him.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.900
Jesus, I can't...

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.700
I can't stop thinking about what
we could do with all that dough.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.999
Will you just stop? All right.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.200
A lot of guys mess
around with married women,

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.300
but you're the only one
I know who robs a joint

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.600
just to pay back the husband.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.000
Crazy.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.900
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.599
Where's Cook?

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.400
He's in the dressing room.

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.000
Where's that?

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:09.600
It's over there.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.500
Whose money do I have?

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.600
Don't worry. They're
going to come get it.

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.000
No! No!

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.400
Call them.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.000
Somebody call Nino!

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.400
Do you remember this?

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.600
Hello.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.900
Nino?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.900
No, sorry, pal. Why
don't you call back later?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.500
We're closed.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.900
I could, but I think Nino would
be upset that you made him wait.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.600
Can I ask what this is about?

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.400
I have something of his.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.500
And that would be?

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.200
A million dollars.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.200
Please hold.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.800
You got something that
fucking belongs to me?

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.600
It seems that way.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.000
And you're calling me?

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.500
Why?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.500
You expect me to buy my
own shit back from you?

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.300
I'm not selling it.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.400
I'm going to give you a time and a place

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.700
and you're going to come and get it.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.500
Do you understand?

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.400
And what do you get out of it?

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.100
Just that.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.400
Out of it.

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.800
And your partners are happy with that?

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.500
I don't have any partners.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.500
You discuss this with anybody else?

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.300
No, just you.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.900
You're not very good at this, are you?

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.300
Go check out who this fucking guy is.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.200
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.000
Can't talk. I have to go.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.600
Can I just walk with you for a...

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.000
Yeah.

01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:20.600
I have to tell you something.

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:30.800
Standard was into some...

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.500
guys in prison for a lot of money.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.399
And they were going to hurt you
and Benicio if he didn't pay it.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.399
He asked me for my help.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:49.800
Everything went wrong.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.300
I'm sorry.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.100
I still got the money.

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.100
You can have it if you wanted to.

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.900
You can take Benicio...

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.500
I just thought you could get
out of here if you wanted.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.000
I could come with you.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.500
I could look out for you.

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.200
Sorry. Wrong floor.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.400
They came to my apartment, Shannon.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.300
How'd they know where I live?

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.400
I told you. I was going to call Bernie.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.900
I just warned him to know
that... That it wasn't about...

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.100
That you're not interested in the money.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.700
That you just did it for the girl.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.300
I just... Why did you have to
fucking tell them about Irene?

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.400
Calm down!

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.199
You told them about Irene!

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.000
Calm down, kid. Just calm down.

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.200
I should fucking kill you!

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.999
You told them about Irene.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.800
I just wanted him to know

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.100
that as soon as you returned the
money, that was the end of it.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.099
That's all. I didn't know...

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.400
How was I supposed to know?

01:14:50.401 --> 01:14:52.899
How was I supposed to know that? Okay?

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.600
Look, let me just talk to Bernie. Okay.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.000
Why you got to fuck
everything up, Shannon?

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.000
How was I supposed to know
everything led to Nino?

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.800
They're gonna come looking for me.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.699
And they're going to come for you.

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.400
Do you understand?

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.300
You got to get out of here.
And you got to get out now.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.700
Listen to me. God.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.200
Listen to me, Shannon.

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.700
Listen.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.500
You get out of here and
you never fucking come back.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.700
You never come back.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.100
What are you going to do?

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.400
I already gave you my advice.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.100
You should have taken the
money and left the guy alone.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.300
It's not that simple, Bernie.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.600
No, of course not. Now that
it's bounced up in your face.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.000
Nino, I owe you this guy.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.500
Just give me a little time
and I'll get rid of him.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.600
Shut the fuck up,

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500
you fucking monkey.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.500
The money belongs to some
half-assed wise guy out of Philly.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.200
Now, I'm tipped off,

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.600
he was stashing a million
bucks in a pawnshop.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.398
He was going to invest it here in LA.

01:16:21.399 --> 01:16:23.000
He was going to set
up a rival operation.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:26.099
So you stole from the East Coast mob?

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.300
No. I stole from some jumped-up punk

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.200
who was trying to step on our action.

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.000
Yeah? Then why didn't you come to me

01:16:33.001 --> 01:16:35.000
before you set up this dummy robbery?

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.000
Before you hire this piece of shit.

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.600
This is something off
to the side, Bernie.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.000
I didn't want to involve you in this.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.000
Well, I'm involved now!

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.900
I'm going to tell you something.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.200
Anybody...

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.800
Anybody finds out you
stole from the family,

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.399
we're both dead.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.900
What fucking family?

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.800
The family who still
calls me a fucking kike!

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.700
To my face!

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:07.000
Yeah, I'm 59 years old, Bernie.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.600
They still pinch my cheek
like I'm some fucking kid.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.700
Family.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.499
The money always flows up, Izzy.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.000
You know that.

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.900
That's why this driver's
gotta go, Bernie.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.000
He's gotta go.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:25.500
And your pal, Shannon.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.500
These are the only two guys
who can tie me to this robbery.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.900
Now it's your turn to clean up after me.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.300
All these priceless cars.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.500
One would think you'd have better locks.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.300
Why?

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.100
Going somewhere?

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.200
Thinking about it.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.300
I'm looking for your driver.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.300
You break in here, I
figure it's bad news.

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.600
No, Shannon. It's bad luck.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:50.100
2,000 heists a year in this city,

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.000
he has to pick the wrong one.

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.300
He tried to put it right.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.100
Well, he picked the
wrong guy for that, too.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.800
My partner is a belligerent asshole
with his back against the wall.

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.400
Right now, so am I.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.400
If I don't set this
straight, I'm in big trouble.

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:13.000
Any idea where he might be?

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.900

I wanted to see my name on this thing.

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.100
I think we would have
made a go at this business.

Hello?

You know the story about
the scorpion and the frog?

Your friend Nino didn't
make it across the river.

I think this has gone on long enough.

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.500
You see any reason for it to continue?

don't think I can come back.

I can't offer you the same.

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.900
