NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.461 --> 00:06.715
Patrolman Lawrence Swan,
he hung himself this a.m.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.800
What in the hell went on
in that back room last night?

00:08.883 --> 00:10.301
It was just a party, Captain.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.971
There's a couple of individuals
from the sanitation department

00:13.054 --> 00:14.639
got fired after one of your hatchet jobs.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.141
I know how it's gotta look, Captain.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.267
We wind up between his sheets,

00:17.350 --> 00:18.977
and her husband gets whacked
that same night.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.311
So you think Buttman did that girl?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.272
If he did, your silence
is letting him get away with it.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.565
And that's a felony, Jack.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.734
Randall Buttman, you're under arrest.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.902
John, wake up.
There's somebody downstairs.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.154
LaRue just killed somebody.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.490
(indistinct chatter)

00:32.574 --> 00:33.867
JABLONSKI: Item four,

00:34.909 --> 00:38.038
another hooker killing
in the Heights yesterday p.m.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.415
The same M.O. as the previous five.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.333
Either this kook is heatin' up,

00:42.417 --> 00:44.294
or else we're startin' to get copycats.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.211
Whatever.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.506
Expect a rise in hooker-related violence

00:48.590 --> 00:51.426
as these high-strung females
are gonna be more heavily armed

00:51.509 --> 00:54.763
and less inclined to indulge
their customers' quirks than usual.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.264
Item five,

00:56.514 --> 00:59.476
we had an officer involved
last night out of precinct.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.437
John LaRue, while off-duty,
shot and killed

01:02.520 --> 01:04.647
-an armed burglary suspect.
-MAN: Yeah.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.941
Uh, without the particulars, Detective,

01:07.609 --> 01:09.152
I'm sure the shoot was justified.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.529
In the meantime, you know the routine.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.115
I believe Captain Furillo
would like to see you on his arrival.

01:16.826 --> 01:17.952
Item six.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.289
In the wake of rookie officer
Larry Swan's suicide,

01:21.372 --> 01:24.959
rookie officer Randall Buttman
has been discharged from the force.

01:25.293 --> 01:29.297
And he faces criminal charges
of pandering, assault, and rape.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.259
Former Officer Buttman has been
out on bond, but as we speak,

01:34.094 --> 01:36.721
detectives Brannigan
and Schindler are rearresting him

01:36.805 --> 01:40.016
as per orders
of the district attorney's office.

01:40.558 --> 01:45.647
Additional disciplinary announcements
on the other rookies are due this a.m.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.358
(indistinct chatter)

01:48.441 --> 01:51.903
Item seven,
ah, advertising on the premises.

01:52.946 --> 01:57.659
A certain culinary establishment,
the, uh, the Bengal Pavilion,

01:58.284 --> 02:01.121
has been heavily papering
the precinct with fliers,

02:01.204 --> 02:04.541
offering 10 percent off tandoori chicken
or any curry dish

02:04.624 --> 02:06.960
between the hours
of 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.419
Does that include your mints?

02:10.171 --> 02:13.258
Yeah, that includes your mints,
"But it does not include

02:13.341 --> 02:16.302
your already-discounted
Businessman's Special."

02:16.386 --> 02:19.347
What-- Anyway, whoever's turning a buck

02:19.430 --> 02:21.099
littering the squad room
with these things,

02:21.182 --> 02:24.352
how about I don't want to see
any more of 'em, commencing now.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.895
WOMAN: Right, Sarge.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.022
(indistinct chatter)

02:28.106 --> 02:28.940
Item eight,

02:29.691 --> 02:32.527
rumor has it that our
own officers, Renko and Hill,

02:32.610 --> 02:36.781
are gonna be featured on TV
this a.m. on<i> Morning Report.</i>

02:36.865 --> 02:38.449
(applause)

02:38.533 --> 02:40.952
(chattering)

02:41.786 --> 02:44.330
Coffee and autographs
immediately following.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.292
All right, let's go. Let's get out there.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.961
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.964
(chattering)

02:53.047 --> 02:56.134
We're what you call
"media stars" there, Renko.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.136
(telephone rings)

02:58.219 --> 03:01.598
I'm telling you, if that woman decides
to crucify us on television,

03:01.681 --> 03:03.391
we can bend over and kiss it goodbye.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.101
Cowboy, I have good reason to believe that

03:05.185 --> 03:07.395
no one's reputation
is gonna be unduly soiled.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.439
MAN: Hey, Hill, Renko, check it out!

03:09.939 --> 03:10.773
Let's go.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.735
WOMAN (on TV):<i> Focusing today locally,</i>
<i>here's Lynn Williams.</i>

03:13.818 --> 03:15.153
WILLIAMS:<i> On our continuing series...</i>

03:15.236 --> 03:16.946

03:37.175 --> 03:38.301
<i>As you can see here,</i>

03:38.384 --> 03:41.137
<i>Officer Renko took in far more</i>

03:41.221 --> 03:42.347
MAN: Hey, where you puttin'
all that stuff, Renko?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.182
<i>And when confronted by this reporter...</i>

<i>...Williams reporting.</i>

04:00.323 --> 04:02.492
Move. Move!

MAN: I'm innocent! I didn't--

04:21.719 --> 04:24.013
All right, last name.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.099
G-u-e.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.480
Gué?

04:33.147 --> 04:34.023
Gue.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.067
First name?

04:36.567 --> 04:37.402
Lotta.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.030
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:43.199
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

MAN: Belker.

06:27.845 --> 06:28.971
Hi, Ma.

06:30.681 --> 06:31.682
How are you feeling?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.561
Did you see Dr. Zimmerman?

06:37.688 --> 06:38.523
Ma...

06:38.940 --> 06:42.360
Sweetheart, he has to feel 'em.
How else is he gonna tell?

06:43.778 --> 06:44.612
Ma...

06:45.488 --> 06:47.115
Ma. Ma!

06:47.532 --> 06:49.617
He's a doctor. He sees 'em all day long.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.160
(growls)

06:54.372 --> 06:55.998
Would you feel better if I called him?

06:56.624 --> 06:58.292
I certainly will. I'll call you back.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.462
I love you, too.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.716
Don't worry about a thing, Mom.
It's probably nothing.

07:06.759 --> 07:07.927
All right, goodbye.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.264
What?

07:12.890 --> 07:15.810
Uh, I thought you might
join me for lunch, Mick.

07:16.102 --> 07:16.936
(clears throat)

07:17.770 --> 07:19.021
Yeah, okay.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.357
(chuckles) Ten percent off.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.651
I like 'em just the way they are.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.361
Chocolate swirls comin' out of the oven!

07:25.445 --> 07:27.363
Hey, Renko, what's this? Ooh-hoo-hoo!

07:27.447 --> 07:28.990
Don't do me like that, Joe Coffey.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.159
Don't you all do me like that. Captain!

07:33.119 --> 07:36.080
Captain, I was on the TV this morning.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.081
Yeah, I saw.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.125
That woman took a cheap shot
at me, Captain.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.585
And you really gave it to her, didn't you?

07:40.668 --> 07:42.545
You mean, by exposing my stomach and all?

07:42.628 --> 07:45.715
Andy, it violates the uniform code,

07:45.798 --> 07:48.050
and it gives them footage
anybody would use.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.386
What do you think
they're gonna do to me now?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.471
Depends on Division.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.140
Just turn your log entries over
to Lieutenant Calletano.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.808
-I'll see what I can do.
-Yes, sir.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.228
(indistinct chatter)

07:59.312 --> 08:00.146
J.D.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.986
(telephone ringing)

08:08.654 --> 08:09.489
Shut the door.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.285
I just want you to know,
Captain, I know how bad--

08:14.368 --> 08:15.953
No, this is "LaRue listens,"

08:16.037 --> 08:18.206
and listen carefully,
because it's all you're gonna get.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.124
I just came from Midtown.

08:20.666 --> 08:24.212
The shooting at Caroline Reynolds'
is being pursued as a possible homicide.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.172
Justifiable, right? The guy broke in.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.299
As a possible<i> homicide.</i>

08:28.925 --> 08:31.385
Captain, I'll plead felony bad judgment

08:31.469 --> 08:32.637
for going over there, but seriously--

08:32.720 --> 08:34.889
Look, I told you not
to go back there, J.D.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.975
Right now, nobody's sure whether you were
just stupid or a lot worse.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.437
Now, Captain, this woman
was receiving weird phone calls.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.772
I went over there to protect her.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.566
-Now, I'd like anybody to try and--
-No. No more, J.D.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.569
Your old friend Shipman from I.A.D.
is waiting to have a word with you.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.540
Excuse me,<i> please.</i>

09:01.082 --> 09:02.750
I want to report someone missing.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.460
Who's missing, ma'am?

09:05.002 --> 09:08.422
My cat, Bentley, a white angora.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.132
Today is his 10th birthday.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.927
Ma'am, I think you want the city pound
or the humane society.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.971
Bentley is not lost.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.430
He was kidnapped.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.767
He was waiting for his birthday cake,
and then he was gone.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.812
The city pound or the humane society
are your best bets.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.357
Also, maybe you could post some signs
around the neighborhood.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.025
But you gotta do something.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.862
I know that you're upset, ma'am,
but we're very, very busy today.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.782
Uh, you try those two places.
You see how that goes, okay?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.742
You're not being very helpful at all!

09:39.745 --> 09:41.038
You're aware of your right to counsel?

09:41.122 --> 09:41.956
Yeah.

09:42.832 --> 09:43.874
And you're waiving that right?

09:43.958 --> 09:44.792
Yes.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.255
How about being a good guy, Shipman.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.673
Tell me what the hell's goin' on.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.967
How long have you known Caroline Reynolds?

09:53.050 --> 09:54.343
I told you yesterday.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.804
This is<i> today's </i>murder investigation.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.139
Very funny.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.974
How long have you known Caroline Reynolds?

10:00.057 --> 10:02.393
Two days. What, they think
she set somethin' up?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.979
What's the nature of your relationship
with Caroline Reynolds?

10:05.062 --> 10:06.897
Personal. Love.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.400
Come on, Shipman.
Do they think she set somethin' up?

10:09.775 --> 10:11.777
Was there any financial arrangement
between the two of you?

10:13.821 --> 10:14.655
No.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.664
Three stars on Irwin's forehead.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.335
Throwing Buttman back in the clink
scared the hell out of his lawyer, plus,

10:27.418 --> 10:30.338
I've convinced him Furillo's got this,
Furillo's got that.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.048
He's two steps from a murder indictment.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.383
-They've offered to plead.
-To what?

10:34.675 --> 10:36.719
-Assault one in the Swan case.
-What kind of time?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.429
Three years, the easy kind,
minimum security.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.973
-Irwin.
-Don't. Don't "Irwin" me, Frank.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.475
What have we got on this guy?

10:42.725 --> 10:44.769
Instigating the rape of Larry Swan?

10:45.311 --> 10:47.438
You want to sell a jury
a full-grown man gets raped?

10:47.521 --> 10:48.856
-I don't.
-You don't believe Buttman

10:48.939 --> 10:49.857
murdered that prostitute?

10:49.940 --> 10:52.026
We haven't got a single piece
of admissible evidence.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.361
Well, then give us time, damn it!

10:53.444 --> 10:54.779
Isn't that why we arrested him again?

10:54.862 --> 10:57.114
Give you time,
and the horror story I just fed them

10:57.198 --> 10:58.866
unravels like a Singapore suit.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.619
All right, just the day then.
Henry's already on it.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.746
Got witnesses to check, and Buttman.

11:06.582 --> 11:07.958
(sighs) The day.

11:09.835 --> 11:10.711
Talk on you later.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.049
Hey, slick.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.345
-Ronnie.
-Yeah, I got to hand it to you, man.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.888
You played it real nice.

11:20.971 --> 11:21.806
What's that?

11:22.264 --> 11:25.142
All the cheap music,
"Be right with yourself, Ronnie.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.770
Be a right cop. Be a right brother."

11:27.853 --> 11:29.230
I don't know what you're talking about,
Ronnie.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.315
What'd you get out of it, Washington?
You get yourself a promotion?

11:31.399 --> 11:33.317
-Out of what?
-Out of gettin' us fired!

11:33.901 --> 11:34.735
Fired?

11:35.194 --> 11:37.988
We're all fired,
suspended contemplating dismissal.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.657
You tellin' me you didn't know that?

11:40.032 --> 11:40.866
That's right.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.576
You know I don't believe you, Neal,

11:42.660 --> 11:44.620
because you've been
so straight with me till now.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.254
(knocks on door, opens)

11:54.213 --> 11:56.006
Is it true Garfield's fired?

11:56.298 --> 11:58.008
All the rookies who were at the incident.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.470
But Garfield gave 'em Buttman.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.514
After giving a perjured statement
to I.A.D.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.683
You tellin' me you never played
D and D to protect another cop?

12:05.766 --> 12:07.101
Never to conceal a felony.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.603
Captain, you're talkin' about a kid
takin' a few hours to find the guts...

12:09.687 --> 12:11.772
There were a lot of other
factors involved, Neal.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.357
And getting fired for doing it.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.527
If you're interested, I think maybe
they did come down hard on Garfield,

12:16.610 --> 12:18.446
but he wasn't my cop,
and it wasn't my decision.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.114
Oh, buck don't stop with you, is that it?

12:20.197 --> 12:21.157
Not this one.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.033
-A little selective, Captain.
-Neal.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.786
I have to ask you something about J.D.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.830
You have any reason to think
that he knew Caroline Reynolds

12:27.913 --> 12:29.540
-before two days ago?
-No.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.253
Oh, Sergeant, wait!

12:35.463 --> 12:37.131
Will this do for a poster?

12:38.215 --> 12:39.049
Sure, ma'am.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.969
Maybe his lips are a little fuller.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.014
Why don't you put 'em up outside?

12:45.473 --> 12:49.518
Oh, what kind of a police department
is this anyway?

12:50.019 --> 12:52.313
Sergeant, didn't you ever have
a pet you loved?

12:52.396 --> 12:56.442
I mean, how would you feel
if one day your friend was missing,

12:56.525 --> 12:58.194
maybe even in danger?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.656
What's his name?

13:04.784 --> 13:05.618
Blackie.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.286
Uh-huh.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.378
Buttman.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.715
(sighs)

13:20.966 --> 13:22.510
I went through your log entries.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.011
There are two gaps for yesterday.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.971
Drop dead, Goldberg.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.062
One for 45 minutes in the morning.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.021
(sighs)

13:34.104 --> 13:37.525
Another hour and 20 commencing
at quarter past 12:00.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.194
I took some personal time.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.071
You're allowed one break.

13:42.905 --> 13:43.823
I took<i> two.</i>

13:44.490 --> 13:45.991
You gonna take points off my score?

13:48.244 --> 13:50.412
Where were you the 45 minutes
that Coffey had to wait for you?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.749
I can't answer that, advice of counsel.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.794
How about the hour and 20?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.380
Oh, that's different, right?

14:00.005 --> 14:02.550
The first 45 I'm silent
on advice of counsel,

14:02.633 --> 14:03.968
but now for<i> this </i>hour...

14:04.677 --> 14:07.012
Look, Lieutenant,
I bought lottery tickets.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.305
I did my laundry.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.432
I planned my next vacation to Hawaii.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.062
Get this guy out of here.
I'm through talkin' to him.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.690
(sighs)

14:20.317 --> 14:21.485
Thanks. I'm done.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.995
You go get him, Mr. Hebroid!
Put a white cop away.

14:38.419 --> 14:42.214
(indistinct talking on radio)

14:42.298 --> 14:44.550
Renko, are you gonna talk today or what?

14:44.633 --> 14:47.428
No. I'm givin' you the silent treatment.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.096
-Well deserved.
-Come on, Renko.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.098
I went to see the woman
for the both of us. I didn't know

14:51.181 --> 14:53.392
-she was gonna do that to you.
-"Oh, that Bobby Hill, he's so cute.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.561
-Oh, man.
-I ain't gonna hang him out to dry.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.062
I'm not gonna publicly ridicule him.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.814
I'm gonna stick it
to his slob of a partner."

14:58.898 --> 15:01.400
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Units in vicinity,</i>
<i>1439 Van Buren.</i>

15:01.483 --> 15:03.319
<i>-Armed assault in progress.</i>
-We just passed it.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.820
2202 in response.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.615
(siren wails, tires screech)

15:07.698 --> 15:09.116
(baby crying)

15:09.199 --> 15:11.452
Down those stairs! He tried to kill me!

15:11.535 --> 15:13.078
Bobby, go around to the front.
Ma'am, you wait here.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.497
-I'll get you some medical, okay?
-Wait! Don't leave me!

15:15.581 --> 15:18.042
He's a freak! He's a murderer!

15:21.921 --> 15:24.715
(clicking)

15:25.799 --> 15:28.469
(stairs creaking)

15:41.732 --> 15:42.566
(grunts)

15:42.942 --> 15:44.068
(groans, grunts)

15:45.319 --> 15:46.153
(grunts)

15:46.820 --> 15:47.655
(grunts)

15:51.200 --> 15:52.034
Bobby!

15:55.412 --> 15:57.665
Backup!
I got a suspect with in the froose case

15:57.748 --> 15:58.707
goin' down the alley!

16:02.878 --> 16:04.129
(grunting)

16:05.297 --> 16:06.256
(grunting)

16:06.882 --> 16:09.760
(siren wails)

16:15.766 --> 16:18.185
(breathing heavily) You got anything?

16:18.268 --> 16:20.354
-(siren wails)
-BOBBY:<i> No. No.</i>

16:20.896 --> 16:22.189
Damn!

16:35.202 --> 16:36.620
I'm sorry, Detective, but you see,

16:36.704 --> 16:39.498
when you take potluck, usually,
usually you end up with brisket.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.166
Uh-uh. I want to see the chief.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.752
And I'm tellin' you you came down
without an appointment,

16:43.836 --> 16:45.879
and I'm gonna have to do.

16:46.463 --> 16:47.297
(sighs)

16:48.590 --> 16:50.300
It's about these rookies that got fired.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.553
-The hazing incident.
-Mm-hmm.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.595
It was disgraceful.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.431
I'll tell you something else
that's disgraceful.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.016
You ask a kid to be honest.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.018
You tell him to forget all
that stuff about the cop code,

16:59.101 --> 17:01.020
that the only guys you can trust
are your partners.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.688
You tell him to go ahead
and believe in the system,

17:02.771 --> 17:04.148
then you cut him off at the knees.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.067
Detective, I assume you're talking
about the rookie who came forward.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.028
Behind my askin' him to,
you're damn right,

17:09.111 --> 17:10.571
and you fired him for it.

17:11.947 --> 17:15.492
Under the prevailing circumstances,
detective, I had no choice.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.244
Well, I think it stinks.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.580
You're entitled to that thought.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.082
I'll be at the Rotary brunch.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.377
Maybe you could explain the larger picture
to Detective Washington.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.212
-Hey, wait a minute!
-Washington.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.381
Don't be stupid, hmm?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.175
You get your hand off of me.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.016
-Hey, talk to you guys?
-About Reynolds?

17:39.099 --> 17:40.225
I don't have the flu, okay?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.894
Will somebody just tell me
what the hell's happening?

17:41.977 --> 17:43.103
Ongoing, J.D.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.772
Hey, come on.
Just play me a couple of bars.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.024
-No way.
-Mayo, line four.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.695
Harry. Hey, hey, Harry. Harry. Harry.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.990
The headhunters are measuring
my hat size, and I'm clean, man.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.200
I told 'em I don't want a lawyer.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.951
I don't want nothin'. I just want a clue.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.578
Come on, man, huh? What do you say?

17:59.661 --> 18:00.579
J.D., the guy you shot

18:00.662 --> 18:02.748
is the same guy that killed
Caroline's husband.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.333
-Oh, man.
-Yeah. There's a ballistics match

18:04.416 --> 18:05.250
with his weapon.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.879
Plus, there was a snapshot
of her in the guy's wallet.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.048
-Caroline?
-Yeah, in the nude.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.175
So that puts two theories on the board.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.094
"A," the guy who took off the husband

18:15.177 --> 18:16.970
found out enough
about his crib and his wife

18:17.054 --> 18:18.222
to go after them, too.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.934
Or theory "B," Caroline got
involved outside of her marriage

18:22.017 --> 18:23.519
and suckered the guy
into killing her husband.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.687
So, now she's stuck
with a million insurance

18:25.771 --> 18:27.397
and a boyfriend
she don't want to share it with.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.858
So she changes the door locks.
She calls the boyfriend.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.402
She says, "Thomas, come quick.
There's a prowler."

18:32.486 --> 18:34.738
He does, but he can't unlock the door,
so he breaks in.

18:34.822 --> 18:35.948
You gotta be kiddin' me.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.700
Yeah, well, the thinking is that
if she set up the boyfriend,

18:38.784 --> 18:40.077
then she either suckered you, too--

18:40.661 --> 18:43.247
Oh, or made me a partner.
Great. Oh, that's just great.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.290
-You believe that?
-No.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.668
Plus, she'd have to have
called the boyfriend,

18:47.751 --> 18:49.503
and the phone company has no record.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.340
Man, this is the best woman
I met in the last 15 years.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.425
-(phone receiver clicks)
-Aw, brother.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.929
-You're a jerk.
-Oh, come on.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.848
Let's give the guy a break, huh?
He's a cop.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.516
You were out of policy, Harry.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.934
At the least he's a chronic screw-up.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.979
At worst he's a primary suspect
in a murder investigation.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.438
I worked too hard for my badge

19:08.522 --> 19:10.524
to bet it all on which
of the two we're dealing with.

19:10.858 --> 19:14.611
P.S., insurance policy
had an accidental-death kicker.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.655
Jacks it up to a million and a half.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.740
Frank! Frank.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.411
We've got Renko's description
on the assault out citywide.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.704
What did we get from the prostitute?

19:23.787 --> 19:26.290
Well, more descriptions,
and she'll press charges.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.293
-She says he talked weird.
-All right, stay on it.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.963
We have a lead on the prostitute killings.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.715
And it isn't Randall Buttman.

19:34.798 --> 19:35.716
Nothing from him.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.219
Still no murder weapon.
Witnesses gave us zip.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.305
The only forensics we have
is some tan pants fibers

19:41.388 --> 19:43.015
from Lois Jordan's bedspread.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.977
So you figure five,
maybe six tricks a day.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.147
-Which leaves us nowhere.
-Or maybe Buttman didn't do it.

19:50.772 --> 19:51.940
Maybe this other guy did 'em all.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.026
Don't give up.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.863
-Henry, are we on for a quick lunch today?
-Sure.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.282
Listen, I thought maybe we'd try this.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.451
-Okay.
-What's wrong?

20:02.534 --> 20:03.869
-You don't like Indian?
-No, it's great.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.956
(indistinct chatter)

20:08.040 --> 20:10.417
I was just downtown trying
to talk to Chief Daniels.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.127
-Oh?
-Well, you told me

20:12.211 --> 20:15.589
it was his call firing Garfield.
I figured he was the man to talk to.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.050
Get any satisfaction?

20:18.133 --> 20:21.220
I got about 2 1/2 seconds
on the prevailing public climate

20:21.303 --> 20:23.138
and looking at the big picture.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.599
You know, there may be
something to that, Neal.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.892
Maybe from where you sit, captain.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.810
Now the way I look at it,
it's a lot more simple.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.647
I told the kid to do the right thing,
and the department's making me a Judas.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.106
I've got to look at myself mornings.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.733
Neal, come on.
You're making a big mistake.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.235
Why don't you give it
the night to think it over?

20:36.318 --> 20:39.363
If I did, Captain, maybe I<i> would </i>start
thinking about the big picture.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.114
That's not the kind of person
I want to be.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.457
Proof, Sergeant. Proof of crime.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.042
What is it, ma'am?

20:53.293 --> 20:54.169
See here?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.088
Foreign men.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.632
They put cats in shopping bags,

20:58.715 --> 21:01.718
and then they must sell 'em
from behind their establishment.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.972
Uh, Sergeant Bates,
you wanna eyeball this?

21:07.516 --> 21:08.934
Oh, "catibalism."

21:10.477 --> 21:11.478
Well, you wanna check it out?

21:13.146 --> 21:13.981
Sure.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.028
All right. So, Ted, here's what I need.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.823
A record of all calls
in the last month to this residence

21:22.906 --> 21:24.241
from any one of these numbers--

21:24.533 --> 21:28.328
5571, 6807, 5692.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.664
These are pay phones.
They're all near each other on Spring.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.207
Can you do that through last night?

21:32.874 --> 21:34.793
We could if they're all toll calls,

21:34.876 --> 21:38.880
but, detective, I think I need
at least some kind of subpoena.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.258
Some kind of subpoena?

21:43.135 --> 21:45.554
Hey, Ted, Ted. Now look here, okay?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.348
Look at, look what it says.
See? It says, "subpoena."

21:48.974 --> 21:50.892
Oh, are you sure that's official?

21:51.226 --> 21:52.269
It's official as can be.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.938
Ted, man, this is a police emergency.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.690
-We need 'em now.
-(scoffs)

21:57.024 --> 22:00.444
Public-phone logs are enormous.
I can't just snap my fingers.

22:00.527 --> 22:01.987
Fast as you can will be just fine.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.156
WAITER: Some water for you.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.033
Thank you.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.993
So, anyway, yeah,
I'm feeling a little less punk.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.370
Are you gonna be able
to take some time off?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.539
Next week. Spend it with the kids.

22:12.622 --> 22:13.665
Give Rachel a break.

22:14.041 --> 22:14.875
How's she doing?

22:16.418 --> 22:19.129
Actually better.
All things considered, better.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.842
Listen, you know, I didn't know, but--

22:24.384 --> 22:25.594
Well, where was she, Midtown?

22:26.970 --> 22:28.388
Did she see the victims' aide there?

22:29.014 --> 22:29.848
Refused.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.309
If she ever changes her mind,
I've got some phone numbers.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.729
Thanks. How's your chow?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.856
Good. Lamb's a little tough.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.024
Excuse me.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.818
Very nice<i> bajji </i>this.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.866
I know she lives alone,
but isn't there a women's club or--

22:48.367 --> 22:49.743
Very nice<i> goja </i>this.

22:49.826 --> 22:52.204
Thank you.
And a couple of India pales, please.

22:52.579 --> 22:55.123
And, uh, the tandoori
is excellent, by the way.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.041
Thank you.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.756
See, she's made me her whole life,

23:03.006 --> 23:04.174
ever since my father died.

23:04.257 --> 23:06.843
Yeah, well,
the matriarchal-filial connection,

23:07.135 --> 23:09.596
especially in your persuasion,
Mick, is a highly charged one.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.015
Are you kidding?
My mother's a very emotional woman.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.225
Now, now, my mother,

23:13.809 --> 23:15.936
being more your white
Anglo-Saxon Protestant,

23:16.019 --> 23:17.646
keeps a tight rein on her feelings.

23:18.397 --> 23:23.318
The woman has positively mastered
the emotional mood swing.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.363
My mother calls me every single day.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.989
WOMAN: Hi, um, can I get something to go?

23:28.073 --> 23:29.366
-Every day?
-Yeah.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.909
Hmm. Jeez.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.328
It's been nearly a month
since I heard from Pensacola.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.871
Sometimes<i> twice </i>a day.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.166
You know, in an odd way, Mick,
I really envy your closeness.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.126
(sniffs)

23:39.501 --> 23:42.504
Considering, of course,
the probable oedipal ramifications.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.589
Do you know that all
she could talk to me about

23:44.673 --> 23:48.135
are her pains and her doctors
and her new pills?

23:48.218 --> 23:50.303
Yeah, well, nary a peep
from Mother Hunter in that regard...

23:50.387 --> 23:52.764
I don't want her to be a hypochondriac.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.516
Even when she was shot in action.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.059
(sniffs)

23:56.852 --> 23:57.686
What?

23:58.979 --> 23:59.813
Oh...

24:00.647 --> 24:01.606
Mother was a WAC.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.943
-Women's Army Corps.
-Jesus.

24:05.026 --> 24:06.653
And one hell of a commanding officer.

24:06.736 --> 24:07.571
Excuse me.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.574
Vishnu Gulwazi.

24:10.657 --> 24:11.491
WOMAN: He's over there.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.870
Mr. Gulwazi, this is a warrant
to inspect these premises.

24:14.953 --> 24:18.165
What means of insult is this?
Did Varuni put you up to this?

24:18.248 --> 24:20.625
No, no, no, we have reason
to believe that you are violating

24:20.709 --> 24:23.753
administrative code section 637,
"A" through "F."

24:24.504 --> 24:25.630
-Hey! Hey!
-Hey, you, hold it!

24:26.882 --> 24:28.008
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.678
-(cats meowing)
-(indistinct conversations)

24:31.761 --> 24:32.637
What's this?

24:33.430 --> 24:36.933
(meowing continues)

24:37.017 --> 24:38.810
Hey, what are all the cats for?

24:38.894 --> 24:40.729
-Vishnu?
-Mice-- severe mice!

24:40.812 --> 24:43.440
Vishnu... (speaking native language)

24:43.523 --> 24:46.610
(speaking native language)

24:46.693 --> 24:48.945
What is this, some kind
of ambiguous lunch loaf?

24:49.029 --> 24:50.989
-I bought this, all meat.
-Cat meat.

24:51.781 --> 24:55.827
Cat? Is this cat? Am I eating cat?

24:55.911 --> 24:58.246
-You buy these collars, too?
-Where did you find this?

24:58.330 --> 25:00.457
My wife's Mahatma
lost his collar weeks ago.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.917
COP: This doesn't say "Mahatma."

25:02.000 --> 25:03.043
Hey, how long you been serving cat?

25:03.126 --> 25:04.169
Oh, we do not serve cat.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.545
-You are under arrest.
-What for?

25:05.837 --> 25:07.506
BATES: You have the right
to remain silent.

25:07.589 --> 25:08.590
-VISHNU: What did I do now?
-BATES: Should you give up

25:08.673 --> 25:10.300
that right to remain silent...

25:10.383 --> 25:11.468
(siren wailing)

25:11.551 --> 25:14.262
(humming)

25:14.346 --> 25:16.681
<i>♪ Macaroni, macaroni ♪</i>

25:17.432 --> 25:19.267
-MAN: Mm!
-All right, what's the deal here?

25:19.351 --> 25:21.228
The guy's eatin' me out of business.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.897
Wish your girlfriend could have filmed me
on a day like today.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.150
What's with the taco salad?!

25:27.234 --> 25:29.319
You polished it off, fat boy.
Hope it makes you sick!

25:31.780 --> 25:34.658
Can't believe this! Beep, beep!

25:38.411 --> 25:40.872
That guy makes you look anorexic, Renko.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.833
He's eatin' for three. He<i> is </i>three.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.585
He's been here two hours already.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.003
He's a one-man plague of locusts!

25:48.463 --> 25:49.756
RENKO: Look, you got
our sympathy there, pal,

25:49.839 --> 25:51.091
but you've got a sign there that says

25:51.174 --> 25:53.009
"Salad Bar-- All You Can Eat."

25:53.093 --> 25:55.554
He's a menace! He hits every customer
that comes hear him.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.013
He's throwin' food!

25:57.097 --> 26:00.308
The rules also say food must
be carried back to the table!

26:00.392 --> 26:01.268
(indistinct)

26:01.351 --> 26:02.602
All right, what's the problem, sir?

26:02.686 --> 26:04.521
I paid my $4.99.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.731
I'll sit here until next Thursday.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.191
I love this restaurant. (chuckles)

26:08.275 --> 26:10.986
Listen, mister, why don't you just save
a little room for the dessert?

26:11.444 --> 26:12.862
There's plenty of room, don't worry.

26:12.946 --> 26:16.157
Now you look here, pal.
You are making a public pig of yourself.

26:16.616 --> 26:19.869
Pig? Don't call me pig! Pig! (snorting)

26:19.953 --> 26:22.289
That's it! You are under arrest,<i> giganto.</i>

26:22.372 --> 26:24.749
-Thank God. We're saved.
-What did I do?

26:24.833 --> 26:27.294
You are disturbin' the peace,
you are a fire hazard,

26:27.377 --> 26:29.462
and you are a public-health hazard,

26:29.546 --> 26:31.506
and there is danger here of assault,

26:31.590 --> 26:34.759
so you put your big fat arms
behind you, you bloat!

26:34.843 --> 26:36.219
I can't! They won't go.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.721
-MAN: Roll him out of here.
-On your feet.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.139
Make me!

26:41.808 --> 26:44.269
You don't want to arrest me, believe it.

26:44.352 --> 26:47.272
-(groans)
-WOMAN: I'm going somewhere else.

26:47.355 --> 26:48.815
-MAN: That's awful.
-WOMAN: Really.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.820
(siren wails)

26:53.903 --> 26:57.157
Of all the terrible things
that have happened in the last two days,

26:57.949 --> 26:59.951
the worst is what I hear in your voice.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.245
I'm a suspect, Caroline.
We're both suspects in a murder.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.913
You want me to sound like
the Good Humor Man?

27:03.997 --> 27:05.206
I don't want you to be happy.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.916
I just don't want you to suspect me.

27:07.000 --> 27:07.917
Aw, come on!

27:08.710 --> 27:11.212
I can't help it! I love you!

27:11.671 --> 27:14.174
And if you started from that,
knowing that I couldn't do this,

27:14.716 --> 27:16.968
then everything they've found
would have an explanation.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.055
(sighs) He went through
my husband's wallet,

27:20.138 --> 27:23.600
he found that picture of me
and the apartment address.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.268
Of course the bullets are gonna match

27:25.352 --> 27:28.104
if the same man who killed
my husband shot at you!

27:28.647 --> 27:30.690
God, of all the people
to have to explain this to!

27:30.774 --> 27:32.400
-What about the phone calls?
-What phone calls?

27:32.484 --> 27:33.860
I don't know what you're talking about!

27:33.943 --> 27:36.821
Not this phone,
the pay phone at the corner.

27:36.905 --> 27:40.033
Twenty four calls the last two weeks
from the pay phone outside here

27:40.116 --> 27:42.118
-to Thomas Lake's apartment.
-I don't know!

27:42.744 --> 27:45.038
Maybe my husband and he knew each other.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.706
Maybe the shooting wasn't a robbery.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.832
They might have been arguing.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.126
I told you some of the ways
that Warren made money.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.462
Which explains all the calls
except the one last night--

27:52.545 --> 27:53.922
Forty minutes before the guy broke in.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.548
Now, Warren was dead for that one!

27:55.632 --> 27:57.300
Maybe the thief called his own apartment.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.177
Maybe he had a girlfriend back there.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.971
Boy, you really got it down, don't you?
Every angle.

28:02.972 --> 28:04.349
You think I made that call?

28:06.017 --> 28:08.061
That I got out of bed
and went to the corner

28:08.144 --> 28:09.229
with you still here?

28:12.816 --> 28:14.442
Well, it's obvious
I can't make you believe

28:14.526 --> 28:16.820
that I'm as much a victim
in this as you are.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.615
I'm a suspect in a murder investigation,
Caroline.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.075
I'm on the verge of losing my career.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.285
All right, John. All right, listen to me.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.621
If you want it,

28:27.372 --> 28:28.957
and if it would help
under the circumstances,

28:29.040 --> 28:30.250
I could give you some money.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.795
Uh, 50,000 dollars if you need it.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.381
You mean...

28:37.006 --> 28:39.843
you mean so I'll sit on the evidence
about those phone calls.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.096
You said you were a suspect,

28:44.222 --> 28:45.890
that it was gonna ruin your career.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.350
I thought it would help.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.521
My God, what do you think I am?

28:51.938 --> 28:54.190
You honestly think I'm a murderer?

28:54.858 --> 28:56.109
You want to know what I think?

28:57.444 --> 28:59.404
I think you're heavier than me, Caroline.

29:00.655 --> 29:01.489
(exhales)

29:01.906 --> 29:03.658
I think you're way out of my league.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.707
(door opens, slams)

29:10.790 --> 29:12.459
You're the only cop smart enough
to check the phone booth

29:12.542 --> 29:15.044
and the only cop dumb enough
to go to her first with the evidence.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.130
Captain, you're not
understandin' some things.

29:17.505 --> 29:18.923
There was a love affair here, okay.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.550
Maybe I was a jerk, but I loved her.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.218
I thought she'd tell me the truth.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.720
I wanted to believe she would.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.221
Is it enough to bust her?

29:25.555 --> 29:27.766
Sure. Enough to hold her? I don't know.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.975
GARIBALDI: What about a conviction?

29:29.309 --> 29:31.561
I'll have to check and see how
much the phone record helps.

29:31.644 --> 29:33.938
Captain, maybe, uh,

29:34.397 --> 29:36.065
I can go back to her with a wire.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.445
I mean, she offered me the 50 grand once.
Maybe she'll do it again. I don't know.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.157
-Maybe I can get a confession.
-You're willing to do that?

29:46.326 --> 29:47.494
Without a confession,

29:47.911 --> 29:49.454
I mean, she didn't pull the trigger.

29:50.079 --> 29:53.166
There's nothin' in her apartment,
nothin' in the dead guy's apartment.

29:53.249 --> 29:54.542
It's real circumstantial.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.046
Get a court order for the wire.

30:04.719 --> 30:09.015
Uh, Mrs. Simmons,
your information was 100 percent--

30:09.098 --> 30:09.933
See?

30:10.683 --> 30:13.186
But I'm afraid
that we didn't find your Bentley.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.021
-No?
-No.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.981
Uh, fact is, Mrs. Simmons,

30:17.065 --> 30:19.317
odds are pretty good
that Bentley has been...

30:20.944 --> 30:21.903
Has departed.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.912
Trouble is, Mrs. Simmons,

30:30.995 --> 30:33.706
we found a couple of other
little guys in there,

30:33.790 --> 30:36.960
uh, pets with no owners.

30:37.043 --> 30:37.877
(meowing)

30:39.504 --> 30:42.215
Isn't that the cutest
little fellow you ever saw, Mrs. Simmons?

30:43.007 --> 30:44.801
-Huh?
-I want Bentley.

30:45.301 --> 30:46.886
I hate to think what's gonna happen to<i> him</i>

30:46.970 --> 30:48.972
if nobody claims him at the pound.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.432
-(meowing)
-What kind of a police department is this

30:51.516 --> 30:54.310
when you can't even protect
a poor pussycat?

30:54.394 --> 30:55.228
(meowing)

30:55.687 --> 30:57.897
You don't want him? I'll take him.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.859
RENKO: Get on in there! Hey, get in there!

31:05.572 --> 31:07.490
Hold it, hold it.
Anybody got change for a dollar?

31:07.574 --> 31:08.700
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

31:09.033 --> 31:11.661
Sarge, you got a place
we can park this Zeppelin?

31:11.744 --> 31:13.621
We're all filled up
with them restaurant people.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.206
-Put him in a squad room.
-Restaurant?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.667
Shut your snout, you feeder hog, you!

31:19.002 --> 31:21.504
Hey, Leo, that guy looks like
the box you came in

31:21.588 --> 31:22.422
before the diet.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.758
I hate my diet!
Everything comes in packets!

31:26.467 --> 31:27.844
-I'm hungry.
-Be quiet.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.512
-Just sit down here, Jumbo.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.226
What if I cook dinner for you tonight?

31:35.310 --> 31:38.396
How would that be?
Your rain check from last time.

31:40.398 --> 31:44.861
-Okay.
-Eight o'clock, home cookin', no packets.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.114
Chief.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.367
I need help with Neal Washington.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.912
Neal Washington needs help
from Dale Carnegie.

31:53.995 --> 31:57.040
The man came within a body hair
of being up on charges earlier today.

31:57.123 --> 31:57.957
He quit.

31:58.958 --> 32:00.376
Over this rookie business?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.629
What do they want us to do,
give 'em all medals?

32:02.712 --> 32:05.256
He felt it was wrong to punish
the rookie who came forward

32:05.340 --> 32:07.216
as severely as the ones
who kept stonewalling.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.093
In a more forgiving public atmosphere,

32:09.177 --> 32:10.803
I might have considered the possibility.

32:10.887 --> 32:14.057
I'd like to tell him you intend
to modify Garfield's punishment.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.477
Frank, it's bad enough being
second-guessed by one of my captains,

32:17.560 --> 32:19.729
but I will not tolerate it
from a beat cop!

32:19.812 --> 32:20.813
I appreciate your position,

32:20.897 --> 32:22.649
but I don't want to lose
one of my best detectives.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.192
He's hot. He'll cool down.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.610
I know the man. I don't think so.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.863
(sighs) Don't these people
ever think about time?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.157
Don't they ever realize
that pencils have erasers?

32:31.699 --> 32:32.575
Meaning?

32:33.451 --> 32:34.285
Meaning...

32:35.536 --> 32:38.456
I suppose Garfield's punishment
might possibly be modified

32:38.539 --> 32:40.583
in a few weeks at the
departmental review board.

32:40.667 --> 32:43.002
I'm not above rethinking a decision.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.253
I need something more definite.

32:44.879 --> 32:46.965
Twenty one days suspension without pay

32:47.048 --> 32:49.175
if he agrees to testify
at Buttman's trial,

32:49.258 --> 32:51.135
and that's as definite
as it's going to get, Frank.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.096
-May I tell that to Washington?
-Off the record.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.348
It's a generous decision, Chief.

32:55.974 --> 32:56.808
Thank you.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.937
-He was really gonna quit?
-He felt he'd broken his word.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.523
Hard to understand that kind of thinking.

33:16.035 --> 33:17.787
What I'm gonna tell you is off the record.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.540
They're willing to rescind
Garfield's termination

33:20.623 --> 33:21.874
at the departmental review.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.460
He'll get a 21-day suspension without pay.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.671
-Says who?
-Chief Daniels.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.047
Then why'd they put him
through all this, huh?

33:28.548 --> 33:30.508
We're not gonna get into
a policy discussion here.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.136
But I want you to reconsider
your resignation.

33:33.219 --> 33:35.555
-It's not that simple, Captain.
-Excuse me, but it<i> is </i>that simple

33:35.638 --> 33:37.098
unless you have some other agenda.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.059
You want to commit occupational suicide?

33:40.768 --> 33:43.021
You want to blow 14 years
toward a pension, be my guest.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.897
That kid came forward
because of me, captain,

33:44.981 --> 33:46.065
and the department shafted him!

33:46.149 --> 33:47.900
And now they're willing to unshaft him.
What are you looking for?

33:48.901 --> 33:49.736
I don't know.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.613
Maybe I'm looking for somebody
to say they're sorry.

33:52.905 --> 33:54.615
Maybe for once I want to see

33:54.699 --> 33:56.242
someone admit that they were wrong.

33:56.325 --> 33:57.326
Getting you exactly what?

33:57.410 --> 34:00.580
Some satisfaction,
not looking like such a chump.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.665
Neal, you stuck your neck out
for this kid.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.709
I'm not sure I would have
under the circumstances.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.085
You have my respect for that.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.756
But if you can't let go now,
I mean, if you're holding out

34:09.839 --> 34:13.301
because your ego says you need
some more, you lose me.

34:17.930 --> 34:18.931
Points taken.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.018
Points appreciated, captain.

34:25.813 --> 34:26.647
Good.

34:33.571 --> 34:36.115
-Coffee break?
-No way-- no food.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.535
-Renko, you're still allowed.
-Lost my appetite, Robert.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.038
That monstrous human
was like a nightmare vision.

34:42.121 --> 34:45.541
The possible deadly future
of an unchecked Andrew Renko

34:45.792 --> 34:48.961
ravaging the countryside
consuming everything in sight.

34:50.296 --> 34:51.672
-That's him.
-What?

34:51.756 --> 34:54.509
The guy, the slashin' guy this morning,
the guy with the hookers.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.177
All right, I got him.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.096
Stay behind him. Do not get next to him.

34:58.179 --> 35:01.140
-Do not get next to him.
-(siren wails)

35:01.933 --> 35:05.311
-(siren wails)
-Okay.

35:08.856 --> 35:12.318
All right,
I want you to get out of your vehicle

35:12.401 --> 35:13.903
with your hands above your head.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.030
Keep 'em above your head.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.867
-(gunshots)
-WOMAN: Get down! (screams)

35:19.951 --> 35:21.828
(tires screech)

35:21.911 --> 35:23.788
-Get him!
-(siren wails)

35:23.871 --> 35:26.582
RENKO: 202 northbound
in alley west 2-9 street.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.295
Armed, a dangerous suspect
with a blue Pontiac.

35:31.379 --> 35:34.924
Shots fired at officers.
Repeat, shots fired at officers.

35:36.008 --> 35:40.346
(tires screeching, siren wailing)

35:44.267 --> 35:46.936
(gunshots)

35:53.109 --> 35:54.777
Okay! Okay!

35:55.236 --> 35:56.404
I'm coming out!

35:57.029 --> 35:57.989
Don't shoot!

36:02.368 --> 36:04.036
-Don't shoot!
-Up against that wall, man.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.705
Get up against that wall, man!

36:09.333 --> 36:12.503
He slashed a hooker.
Maybe he slashed 'em all, huh?!

36:12.587 --> 36:14.338
You shot at me, too, didn't you, huh?

36:14.422 --> 36:16.174
All right, you got
the right to remain silent.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.092
If you give up the right to remain silent,

36:18.467 --> 36:19.594
anything you say can...

36:22.054 --> 36:23.764
(indistinct chatter)

36:23.848 --> 36:25.308
WOMAN: All right, let's get ready to roll.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.477
Pats, S.I.D. wants everything we voucher.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.645
-WOMAN: Ready, officer...
-Talk about a jerk,

36:29.729 --> 36:31.606
it's full of women's underpants.

36:32.398 --> 36:35.401
With me is Officer Andrew Renko
of Hill Street.

36:35.484 --> 36:37.361
This is a remarkable story.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.614
Just this morning on<i> Morning Reports,</i>

36:39.697 --> 36:42.074
I made this cop out to be a goldbrick,

36:42.158 --> 36:43.701
or maybe a donut brick.

36:43.784 --> 36:47.330
This afternoon, two rounds were
fired at him, point-blank range,

36:47.413 --> 36:50.291
by a maniac suspected
of murdering six women,

36:50.666 --> 36:54.212
and Officer Renko perseveres
to apprehend the suspect.

36:54.545 --> 36:58.883
Officer, please accept
this reporter's apologies, and, uh...

37:01.802 --> 37:02.637
May I?

37:03.512 --> 37:04.472
Why, thank you, ma'am.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.182
Thank you very much.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.935
I did Jeannette Brandon.

37:09.852 --> 37:13.189
I did a red-haired whore named... Mary.

37:14.106 --> 37:16.234
I did Tiffany Conlan.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.236
I did Donna Smith.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.197
And these are all women

37:21.280 --> 37:24.075
who give their sexual favors
for mere money.

37:25.493 --> 37:26.661
There'll be a lineup tomorrow

37:26.744 --> 37:28.621
for a woman who was attacked this morning.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.499
She said her name was Star.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.252
She wanted 40 dollars.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.045
She's filth.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.215
Our strategy is to get you evaluated,
Mr. Platt.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.551
Plus, we keep absolute silence.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.554
Wait and see what they have.

37:48.891 --> 37:49.976
Do you understand...

37:50.893 --> 37:53.604
that I'm not... ashamed?

37:54.522 --> 37:55.356
I understand.

37:58.985 --> 38:02.071
(indistinct chatter)

38:02.154 --> 38:02.989
Excuse me.

38:06.826 --> 38:07.660
What?

38:07.743 --> 38:09.453
Hey, we got some talkin' to do.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.540
-Yeah? You're good at that.
-Hey, you showed up, didn't you?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.959
You gotta have an idea that
I'm tryin' to straighten this out.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.168
How about I got nothin' else goin'?

38:16.252 --> 38:17.378
Aw, shut up, man.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.131
Maybe you got more future than you see.

38:22.174 --> 38:24.593
Now, I got somethin' to tell you, Ron,

38:24.677 --> 38:26.929
and you're gonna have
to trust me on how I know.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.181
Now I want you to lay low
until your D.R.B. review.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.516
No mouth to the press.

38:30.808 --> 38:34.020
If the department asks you to testify
against Buttman, you go ahead do it.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.105
-Why?
-They're gonna give you a better deal.

38:36.188 --> 38:37.940
Now there's been some talk
about the possibility

38:38.024 --> 38:40.026
of a 21-day suspension without pay.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.610
Tell me how you know.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.613
I got friends, including my captain,

38:44.697 --> 38:46.449
who has reason to believe
that's how it'll come down,

38:46.532 --> 38:47.616
and that's all I can say.

38:47.950 --> 38:48.784
Sure.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.371
Got you sittin' up like
a damn dog, don't they?

38:52.705 --> 38:54.206
-What do you mean by that?
-I mean, here you are

38:54.290 --> 38:56.000
tryin' to make me believe how lucky I am

38:56.083 --> 38:58.210
that they're only gonna
suspend me for 21 days

38:58.294 --> 39:00.046
-for tellin' the damn truth!
-Na-uh!

39:00.129 --> 39:03.132
Suspension's for what happened to Swan
and for lying about it afterwards.

39:03.215 --> 39:04.884
If I'd lied and stuck with it,
I wouldn't be in this mess!

39:04.967 --> 39:06.427
Now you listen to me, kid.

39:06.677 --> 39:09.805
What you did in that back room was wrong,
for a cop or anybody else.

39:09.889 --> 39:12.600
Now, you comin' forward doesn't mean
that you don't have to deal with it.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.977
Now, they're handin' you back your career.

39:15.811 --> 39:18.397
Now, you can sulk and think
that they did you wrong,

39:18.731 --> 39:20.066
and then you're gonna be the kind of cop

39:20.149 --> 39:22.860
who's always got a reason,
always an excuse.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.780
Or you can use this
as a chance to start over.

39:26.322 --> 39:29.408
Be a cop who considered he made a mistake
and tries to learn from it.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.077
Now, that's how I hope you go.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.914
Good collar on those hooker killings.

39:35.664 --> 39:37.166
You gonna be ready
for the grand jury tomorrow?

39:37.249 --> 39:39.585
On this morning's attack
and the three other killings,

39:39.668 --> 39:42.213
but there's no link to connect him
with the murder of Lois Jordan.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.923
He's certainly a suspect.

39:44.840 --> 39:45.758
Not if Buttman killed her.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.260
Can you prove that, Frank?
Because if you can't,

39:48.344 --> 39:50.805
I've got a serial killer
stone cold in this hand,

39:50.888 --> 39:53.516
Randy Buttman pleading
to a rape-assault in this.

39:53.891 --> 39:54.767
And that's by me a good day's work.

39:54.850 --> 39:57.019
Well, can we get Platt
to deny he killed Lois?

39:57.436 --> 39:58.938
Single out one murder for denial?

39:59.730 --> 40:01.857
He'd be indicting himself
inferentially in all the others.

40:01.941 --> 40:02.775
-No, no, competent counsel
-(knocking)

40:02.858 --> 40:03.734
would never allow it.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.528
Excuse me, gentlemen,

40:05.903 --> 40:07.780
Mr. Platt awaits the discovery process.

40:07.863 --> 40:09.532
Till then, no deals, no statements.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.158
Come and get us.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.578
And Mr. Platt has competent counsel.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.247
And Buttman gets away with murder.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.832
What you you rather, Lieutenant--

40:18.082 --> 40:20.584
a cosmetic murder trial
or putting the guy away?

40:22.002 --> 40:23.295
Come on, Frank, I gave you the day.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.463
If Buttman's attorney gets wind

40:24.547 --> 40:26.090
that you made a bust
in these hooker killings...

40:26.173 --> 40:28.050
He'll want to renege
on Buttman's plea bargain.

40:28.634 --> 40:29.844
All right, put him away. Close it.

40:30.386 --> 40:31.220
It's best.

40:32.012 --> 40:34.932
You know, sometimes "best"
just doesn't seem good enough.

40:35.307 --> 40:36.559
The ball took a funny bounce.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.854
You ready to move on Caroline Reynolds?

40:40.062 --> 40:41.564
We have the order for a wire.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.650
-(door closes)
-You want to take a little ride?

40:45.317 --> 40:48.612
Ooh. Law-enforcement work, Frank?
I wouldn't miss it.

40:51.198 --> 40:53.075
Ronald Garfield, sir. You got a moment?

40:53.576 --> 40:54.827
I'll just be a minute, Irwin.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.495
Yes, what?

40:56.954 --> 40:59.290
I just wanted to say
that if there's gonna be any charges

40:59.373 --> 41:01.500
against Officer Buttman,
I'm willing to testify.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.252
That's good.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.254
And I don't know how exactly,

41:05.337 --> 41:07.506
but I think I've got you
to thank for something.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.842
My understanding is you've been suspended.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.429
Right. Right. Anyway--

41:13.512 --> 41:15.431
Neal Washington is one
of my best detectives.

41:15.514 --> 41:17.391
If anybody did anything, it was for him.

41:18.392 --> 41:21.020
Anyway, I-I just want to say
I hope that maybe someday

41:21.103 --> 41:22.313
I can be under your command.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.690
A captain stands up for his men.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.859
You have a ways to go before I'd want you.

41:28.068 --> 41:31.238
I'll try to get there. Good night, sir.

41:36.368 --> 41:38.204
-MAN: I'll be right there, Jim.
-WOMAN: That's police brutality!

41:38.287 --> 41:39.288
Look at you.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.624
Here, kitty. Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

41:41.707 --> 41:43.000
-Sergeant.
-Kitty.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.919
Sergeant, is this what you're looking for?

41:45.002 --> 41:47.046
-Aha-ha.
-(meows)

41:47.129 --> 41:49.924
Where did you disappear to,
you little devil?

41:50.007 --> 41:52.927
He was under my desk,
using my leg as a scratching post.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.596
(chuckles) You had me worried sick.

41:55.679 --> 41:56.514
(meows)

41:57.139 --> 41:58.390
(doorbell rings)

41:58.974 --> 41:59.808
Can I come in?

42:01.060 --> 42:02.520
I had to see you to apologize.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.607
It was like I got hit with a tidal wave.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.192
I don't know what the hell was happening.

42:08.817 --> 42:10.819
Baby, just tell me it's not over for us.

42:10.903 --> 42:11.862
You know it is.

42:14.740 --> 42:15.574
Okay.

42:16.992 --> 42:18.452
I understand what happened here,

42:19.787 --> 42:21.872
but it doesn't have
to be too late for this.

42:22.873 --> 42:24.500
Now, whatever happened with your husband,

42:24.583 --> 42:26.710
whatever put that guy
in your apartment last night--

42:26.794 --> 42:28.212
Say what you mean, John.

42:29.171 --> 42:31.423
-LARUE:<i> All right, Caroline.</i>
-So much for a general confession.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.092
Nice try, J.D.

42:33.425 --> 42:35.678
I'm sayin' okay, forget the evidence.

42:36.637 --> 42:37.680
There's explanations for all of it,

42:37.763 --> 42:39.890
even the phone call last night,
which you might want to know,

42:39.974 --> 42:41.934
I lifted a clean fingerprint
off the receiver.

42:42.268 --> 42:44.270
-What fingerprint?
-LARUE:<i> How am I comin' through?</i>

42:45.771 --> 42:47.064
I don't know what you're talking about.

42:47.147 --> 42:49.608
How am I comin' through
if I say 50 grand's not enough

42:49.692 --> 42:51.110
for me to sit on the evidence?

42:51.193 --> 42:52.278
Like a blackmailer.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.530
You sayin' you didn't offer it
to me before?

42:54.613 --> 42:56.740
I offered you a loan
because your career was in jeopardy.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.200
Now you turn it into a shakedown.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.327
You're a stone lyin' bitch, lady!

43:00.411 --> 43:02.454
Oh, God, you ought to be president!

43:03.330 --> 43:04.623
<i>-CAROLINE: I really don't understand...</i>
-We've got as much as we're gonna get,

43:04.707 --> 43:05.958
Frank. He's losing it.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.710
CAROLINE:<i> And I don't know</i>
<i>what I ever did to be...</i>

43:07.793 --> 43:09.837
-Take her.
<i>-...talked to in this ugly way.</i>

43:11.213 --> 43:13.007
It was a setup from the jump,
right, Caroline?

43:13.340 --> 43:14.425
How'd you pick me out, huh?

43:14.508 --> 43:16.719
Guy most likely to follow
his sword into battle?

43:16.802 --> 43:18.137
I think you ought to go.

43:18.220 --> 43:19.888
We're both gonna go. You're under arrest.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.307
-(knocking on door)
-Come in.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.353
You're ready to sit still
for the bust, too, ain't you, baby?

43:26.437 --> 43:28.063
You figured you'd have
to sit still for it.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.149
Shouldn't you read me my rights?

43:36.572 --> 43:38.073
You have the right to remain silent.

43:39.366 --> 43:40.784
And you were afraid
I wasn't gonna get to try

43:40.868 --> 43:42.036
a no-win murder case.

43:42.911 --> 43:45.623
Maybe she'll be overcome by remorse.
Maybe she'll confess.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.458
The only way she was
ever gonna get punished

43:47.541 --> 43:49.168
is if we left her alone with LaRue.

43:49.793 --> 43:50.961
Five more minutes, he'd have killed her.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.463
Five more minutes, he'd have believed her.

43:55.007 --> 43:55.841
Full?

43:56.717 --> 43:57.551
Good.

44:10.022 --> 44:10.856
Was that okay?

44:11.190 --> 44:14.276
I don't know. (chuckles) I-I guess.

44:14.693 --> 44:15.569
Maybe... yeah.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.322
-Again?
-Uh-huh.

44:37.383 --> 44:39.802
Oh, Leo, you<i> are </i>hot.

44:40.427 --> 44:43.555
You have no idea how many times
I've imagined this moment.

44:45.057 --> 44:46.517
Wait. Stop.

44:47.101 --> 44:47.935
Why?

44:48.519 --> 44:49.353
I can't.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.063
It's wrong.

44:52.064 --> 44:53.065
Says who?

44:55.401 --> 44:56.235
I'm-I'm sorry.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.238
It's because I'm plain, isn't it?

44:59.738 --> 45:02.074
It has nothing to do with that.
I don't think you're plain.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.952
Leo, you are not even married anymore,

45:05.035 --> 45:06.578
and she's still looking
over your shoulder.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.081
I-I can't help it.

45:09.665 --> 45:12.167
-I still love her.
-And what am I then?

45:12.251 --> 45:14.086
Some slut you think
you can just come over here

45:14.169 --> 45:16.547
and scrounge a hot meal
and a cheap thrill off of, is that it?

45:16.630 --> 45:18.382
No! You're great.

45:18.924 --> 45:21.969
You're kind.
You're, you're extremely sensuous.

45:22.052 --> 45:22.886
It's just...

45:25.848 --> 45:28.308
the woman owns me, Natalie,
heart and soul.

45:30.811 --> 45:31.645
I'm sorry.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.189
Don't keep apologizing, Leo.

45:34.273 --> 45:35.607
-Okay.
-Just leave.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.786
The casserole was first-rate.

45:56.879 --> 46:00.174
(indistinct conversations)

46:00.257 --> 46:01.091
MAN: Hey, Neal!

46:05.345 --> 46:06.221
Hey, what's happenin'?

46:07.514 --> 46:08.974
I hear you're back on the payroll.

46:09.391 --> 46:10.768
Yeah, hear you are, too.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.145
Yeah, they took me off
the "10 most wanted list"

46:13.228 --> 46:15.689
and slapped an "injudicious conduct"
on my jacket.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.442
I'll never make chief.

46:18.817 --> 46:20.444
(chuckles)

46:21.236 --> 46:22.863
Well, look at the bright side of it, babe.

46:23.614 --> 46:27.326
It's still LaRue, 97, women, one.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.787
Hey, Jerry, let me get
a shot and a beer, okay?

46:29.870 --> 46:31.371
-You got it.
-Twice.

46:32.956 --> 46:36.251
For you. It's been a long day.
You gotta drink for both of us.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.837
(chuckles) Thanks, Jerry.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.756
Hit me again with the seltzer, Jerry.

46:41.465 --> 46:43.842
I gotta tell you, this seltzer,
it's a real pick-me-up.

46:43.926 --> 46:44.760
Ahh.

46:45.427 --> 46:47.805
WILLIAMS (on TV):
<i>I made this cop out to be a goldbrick.</i>

46:47.888 --> 46:49.306
<i>Or maybe a donut brick.</i>

46:49.389 --> 46:51.892
<i>This afternoon,</i>
<i>two rounds were fired at him,</i>

46:51.975 --> 46:53.769
<i>point-blank range, by a maniac...</i>

46:53.852 --> 46:56.438
-Bum one day, hero the next.
-Mm.

46:56.522 --> 46:58.774
<i>...Officer Renko perseveres</i>
<i>to apprehend the suspect.</i>

46:58.857 --> 47:01.151
Thanks for the cocoa, Joyce.
You're more than welcome.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.986
<i>...please accept</i>
<i>this reporter's apologies...</i>

47:03.070 --> 47:03.904
Thank you.

47:05.489 --> 47:08.033
-Honeymoon over that soon?
-WILLIAMS:<i> May I?</i>

47:08.116 --> 47:09.785
-Imagine it.
-RENKO:<i> Why, thank you, ma'am.</i>

47:09.868 --> 47:11.537
A woman gets her lover
to kill her husband,

47:11.620 --> 47:14.331
cons LaRue into killing her lover,
and we can't lay a glove on her.

47:16.291 --> 47:18.418
Gotta roll with the punches, big guy.

47:19.086 --> 47:21.213
Some weeks everybody
gets away with murder.

47:21.296 --> 47:23.090
-Yeah, great.
-Read the cup.

47:24.007 --> 47:26.468
MAN (on TV):<i> It said midnight tomorrow</i>
<i>is the strike deadline</i>

47:26.552 --> 47:28.178
<i>if no settlement is reached.</i>

47:28.595 --> 47:29.888
"Don't bring the office home."

47:30.722 --> 47:31.557
Mm.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.767
<i>...an insult</i>
<i>to the health care professionals...</i>

47:33.851 --> 47:35.602
-His and hers?
-Definitely.

47:36.061 --> 47:38.981
<i>...willingness to negotiate</i>
<i>around the clock to reach agreement.</i>

47:39.064 --> 47:39.940
Visual aids.

47:40.941 --> 47:41.775
(turns off TV)

47:41.859 --> 47:42.943
I like the concept.

47:51.952 --> 47:55.080
This friendly reminder
is also offered in Braille.

47:55.163 --> 47:57.624
(laughter)

48:04.506 --> 48:07.342
(closing theme playing)
