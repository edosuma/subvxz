WEBVTT

00:36.360 --> 00:38.760
I got through to the finals,
I can still make the State Team.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.880
Nothing you can say will make
a single bit of difference.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.480
-Mum!
-Get in the car.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.400
Please?

00:46.240 --> 00:48.400
We're going back to Shorehaven,
picking up your things,

00:48.480 --> 00:49.760
and getting on the
next flight home.

00:49.840 --> 00:50.800
Wait, what!

00:50.880 --> 00:52.400
I thought we were staying
for at least a few more days.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.600
That was before you guys
pulled the escape act.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.720
Summer! Where are you going?

01:00.800 --> 01:04.360
I just wanna catch one more
wave, I'll be right back.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.120
Come back here immediately.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.480
I am too jetlagged for this--

01:24.320 --> 01:27.280
Well what an
amazing day it's been folks.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.000
So much talent on show.

01:29.080 --> 01:32.280
You can't disqualify
him. My son is a gentleman.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.680
He would never do anything like
that unless he was provoked.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.480
I'm sorry, I saw it
with my own eyes.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.400
So did I.
He needs a fair hearing.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.800
The rules are
very clear on this.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.120
On come on!

01:43.200 --> 01:44.880
A bit of team bonding, Marlon?

01:44.960 --> 01:45.960
What happened?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.520
Just leave it okay?

01:49.120 --> 01:51.080
Oh no,
here she comes.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.040
Hey.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.280
Can I help you?

01:56.360 --> 01:58.440
Just checking to
see if you're okay.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.240
I'm great.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.880
What affirmations do
you use for a black eye?

02:05.960 --> 02:09.240
I've got no idea what
you're talking about.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.320
Oh sweetie,

02:10.640 --> 02:13.160
did you really think he
was into you or something?

02:13.240 --> 02:15.280
That's, really sad.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.200
-So embarrassing.

02:30.640 --> 02:34.640
Under 16 Girls
semi-final. Five minute warning.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.040
Hey.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.560
What's wrong?

02:42.240 --> 02:44.240
Griff and Sheridan being tools.

02:47.760 --> 02:48.920
What's new?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.160
You'll show him at
the finals tomorrow.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.000
But even if I come first,
Sheridan or Tran,

02:54.080 --> 02:56.560
only need to get second to
bump me out of contention.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.120
So what am I? Chopped Liver?

02:58.200 --> 03:00.200
How about I win this
and you come second.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.440
Then you'd be set.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.040
What did you do with Bodhi?

03:03.120 --> 03:05.960
Hey I'm just trying to
channel some Tetanui attitude.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.760
This is your fault.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.760
Look, forget about Griff.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.880
Forget all of them.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.040
It's you and me all the way.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.440
This should be
a really exciting showdown.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.880
I've been sent to get you.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.200
So is this your whole plan or..?

03:40.680 --> 03:44.240
No. I figured we'd float
out here until tomorrow,

03:44.320 --> 03:46.880
my mum decides I'm too
much work and bails again.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.440
Right oh.

04:03.640 --> 04:04.720
Under 16s semi-finals.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.200
These girls fighting to keep
their State Team hopes alive.

04:09.200 --> 04:13.120
Let's go, come on!
Go Bodhs!

04:28.120 --> 04:29.440
You okay?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.280
Just a bump on the head.
I'm good.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.160
The pressure's

04:44.240 --> 04:45.680
really starting
to show out there.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.040
Question is,
who can handle it?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.480
Here we go again.
Bodhi Mercer,

04:51.560 --> 04:54.320
squeezing every last
drop out of this one.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.720
Great work for chasing
down that section.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.240
She's killing it!

05:02.320 --> 05:04.800
Sheesh! Where'd she
get this fire from?

05:22.560 --> 05:26.000
Let's go Bodhi, you got this!
Come on, finish it!

05:30.600 --> 05:34.040
And an 8.1 for
Mercer puts her in the lead.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.080
-Bodhi!
-Yeah come on!

05:45.040 --> 05:47.720
-Let's go Bodhi!
-Yeah come on!

06:10.720 --> 06:12.400
I can't see her.
Where is she?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.720
Bodhi?

06:24.800 --> 06:26.240
Yo!

06:26.320 --> 06:28.000
Call for help! Come on!

06:28.080 --> 06:32.000
Over here! Hey! Help!

06:32.080 --> 06:33.440
Please!

06:34.760 --> 06:36.200
Help!

06:46.360 --> 06:47.600
So what's the latest?

06:48.080 --> 06:49.280
I passed the concussion test,

06:49.360 --> 06:51.600
but they're making me stay
overnight as a precaution.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.320
How'd you manage to smack
yourself in the head anyway?

06:54.400 --> 06:56.560
That's a proper kook move.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.200
Someone may have
distracted her.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.800
But apparently
someone also saved me.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.640
So, we'll call it even.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.040
You won that heat by a mile, so.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.120
They'll never let me
surf the final now.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.640
I'm sorry Pops.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.880
I really wanted to
come through for you.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.600
Don't be stupid.
You're okay.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.440
That's all I care about.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.360
Still. Not a post-worthy
end to the season,

07:20.440 --> 07:21.920
stuck in hospital.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.560
Hey, at least you're
not disqualified.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.280
Or the laughing stock
of Anchor Cove.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.720
Or grounded for life.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.440
Or being expelled
from the country.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.560
On the upside...

07:34.640 --> 07:36.040
Jello.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.920
Swiped them from
the nurse's office.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It's called jelly.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.280
It's called Jello.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.600
It's actually called gelatina.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.040
Got it. Got it.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.320
-Great, there you go.
-Thanks.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.800
I'm sorry they disqualified you.
It's not fair.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.000
I honestly
don't know why I moved.

08:02.080 --> 08:07.200
Yes you do. They're a big club
with heaps of resources,

08:07.280 --> 08:10.160
but we're trying to build
something at Shorehaven.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.520
It hurt us to lose you.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.600
You sound like your brother.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.080
Oh, no.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.240
Thanks for sticking up for me.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.360
Back at work already, Margot?

08:29.440 --> 08:30.200
If by work,

08:30.280 --> 08:33.280
you mean desperately reminding
potential employers I exist,

08:33.360 --> 08:34.360
then yes.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.520
Okay, Thommo and
Honey are going to come over

08:38.600 --> 08:39.720
with Bodhi's dad.

08:39.800 --> 08:42.200
So does that mean we
stay another night?

08:42.280 --> 08:43.200
Don't think this means

08:43.360 --> 08:45.040
I'm going to change my
mind about you surfing.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.920
No, no, no, totally
not what I was thinking.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.840
Who else is thinking pizza?

09:01.560 --> 09:04.840
So, photographing war zones
in the Middle East

09:04.920 --> 09:06.240
must get pretty
dangerous. Right?

09:06.320 --> 09:09.320
A lot of people in the
world live dangerous lives,

09:09.400 --> 09:11.000
it's important to document that.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.720
Yeah. No, that makes sense.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.160
But still, what you do
is really brave.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.720
Brave, crazy, selfish.
Depends who you ask.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.080
Yeah. Well that's
the thing, isn't it?

09:22.400 --> 09:25.560
Brave people can seem
crazy from the outside.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.640
Like, I really admire
people that have the courage

09:28.720 --> 09:29.600
to do their own thing.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.480
Is Ari a little obsessed?

09:34.520 --> 09:37.320
Sure. But the kid's
got a dream.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.800
Well, it's not the
ambition that bothers me.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.840
I mean, it's the lying.
I can't trust him.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.560
Obviously, Summer
doesn't play by the rules,

09:46.640 --> 09:49.600
but the important thing is that
she's learning and growing.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.720
I didn't know you
felt that way.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.760
Basically, when I got here,
I was a hot mess.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.600
And then I met Ari and he's
so focused and determined

09:58.680 --> 10:01.520
and it's honestly
kind of inspiring.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.600
Okay. Who's hungry?

10:09.280 --> 10:11.360
I think I really
got through to her.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.000
Yeah same. If this works,
we're officially geniuses.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.840
I'm just saying
he's a sweet kid.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.640
Banning him from surfing
seems a little harsh.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.120
Are you seriously going to
give me parenting advice?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.680
I mean, you should've
heard Summer just now.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.280
She's desperate for any
kind of decent role model.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.680
You're supposed to be
talking about my surfing.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.640
Yeah, I did. And you were
supposed to be gassing me up.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.280
Good old Saint Abbie,
still up on your high horse.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.160
Nothing has changed.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.600
Yeah, you can say that again.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.840
Oh, this is bad.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.240
Yeah. Come on.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.800
Ari I think there's
only one more option.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.640
Tell Abbie about your anxiety.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.240
You can't be serious.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.600
Yeah, just tell her
you're all messed up and

10:59.680 --> 11:02.080
that's why you tried Stairway
again. Why you ran away.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.560
Or how about we tell them
everything was your idea.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.640
Then maybe I'll
be allowed to surf.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.480
Abbie won't believe that,

11:07.560 --> 11:08.320
she knows you're
hiding something.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.080
No! No, she doesn't!

11:10.160 --> 11:11.480
Of course,
your version of a plan B

11:11.560 --> 11:14.280
is you getting what you want
and throwing me under the bus.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.280
You know what?

11:18.360 --> 11:21.200
I don't even think this is about
you getting into the State Team.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.880
You're just scared of
what people will think,

11:22.960 --> 11:24.040
like you'll look
weak or something.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.440
Well this, this right here,
this is weak, Ari.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.600
You judging other
people is too funny.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.800
Have you ever stopped
to think about why

11:30.880 --> 11:33.000
all your relationships
end up a flaming wreck?

11:35.880 --> 11:37.480
I know where this one's going.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.840
The Big Apple is arguably

11:45.920 --> 11:49.040
the most famous and
beloved city in the world.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.520
We'll be telling you stories

11:51.600 --> 11:53.480
from the people
who know it best.

11:53.560 --> 11:56.600
The people who
call New York home.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.640
Pops. Hey.
Can we chat for a sec?

12:54.760 --> 12:56.760
["Feels Right" by
Biig Piig playing

13:43.760 --> 13:45.000
You know,
for you to be surfing

13:45.080 --> 13:46.560
like that after six weeks.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.120
Are you about to
give me some metaphor

13:48.200 --> 13:50.360
about acorns
falling from trees?

13:51.680 --> 13:53.720
I really am sorry
for sending you away.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.240
There are worse places
to be sent.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.520
Since you could walk,
you were so independent.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.600
It might sound stupid but,

14:03.680 --> 14:07.440
I always felt like
the more I interfered,

14:07.520 --> 14:10.360
the more I was just
getting in your way.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.760
Really not the
greatest excuse.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.440
And that's what it was.
It was an excuse.

14:18.280 --> 14:22.000
But, when we
go back to New York,

14:23.360 --> 14:24.520
I'm going to be around.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.160
Pull back, work-wise.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.840
Mum, you shouldn't have to
throw your whole career away

14:33.920 --> 14:35.720
because I can't
control myself.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.720
My happiness shouldn't
mean everyone else suffers.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.080
I don't want to be
that person anymore.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.720
Okay. So we've both got
some things to work on.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.240
Yeah.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.600
Come here.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.040
Finals are about
to get underway here, folks.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.920
Soon we'll find out who
scored those coveted spots

15:15.000 --> 15:16.120
in the State Team.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.720
Morehouse and Tran have
been dominant all season,

15:22.800 --> 15:24.440
and with Mercer out injured,

15:24.520 --> 15:27.040
Tetanui is about to face
them single-handedly.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.080
No doubt the Anchor Cove
hot shots will do

15:30.160 --> 15:33.360
everything they can to
put her out of the running.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.000
I don't know why
they're pretending

15:35.080 --> 15:36.840
it's not already decided.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.720
Hey hey, look listen to me.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.920
Maybe you won't make it today.
But you will make it.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.200
I know this, okay?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.240
Now you're going to have
an incredible career.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.640
And you're already
better than me.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.720
So don't worry
about the points.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.520
You go out there and you
show them what you made of.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.440
Good pep talk coach.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.720
-Can I get one too?
-Whoo!

16:04.800 --> 16:06.080
What are you doing here?

16:06.160 --> 16:08.520
Surfing the final,
what do you think?

16:09.120 --> 16:10.520
You okay with this?

16:10.600 --> 16:13.960
Doc's given her the all clear,
as long as she's careful.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.480
Bodhs, you really
don't have to.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.040
I know, but I am.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.360
Go on.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.560
Come on Bodhi! Surf it up!

16:28.840 --> 16:30.320
Hey, do people say that?

16:30.400 --> 16:31.920
Ah, just say whatever
you like, mate.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.520
It's all made up anyway.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.360
Mercer and Tetanui

16:38.440 --> 16:40.520
still with just that
one decent score each.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.440
Great work by Mercer
to get back here today,

16:42.520 --> 16:44.440
but they are going
to have to hustle

16:44.520 --> 16:46.040
to have any chance of a win.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.040
Let's go, Bodhi.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.080
Manu, how are the girls going?

16:48.160 --> 16:49.720
Ah, they're psyching
themselves out.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.640
Are you okay?

16:50.720 --> 16:54.200
You look stressed for someone
that's not even competing.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.880
It's just weird that
Summer isn't here.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.280
She didn't want to miss this.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.720
Morehouse
needs to watch her back

17:07.800 --> 17:10.760
because Tetanui and Mercer
are working together here.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.560
Mercer needs perfection.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.240
Come on Bodhi!

17:22.320 --> 17:23.960
Does not disappoint!

17:24.040 --> 17:26.280
Mercer really
attacking that wave.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.160
Was that your psych-out look?

17:43.080 --> 17:44.480
No.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.200
Cool.

17:57.840 --> 17:58.880
Tetanui climbs into third

17:58.960 --> 18:03.080
behind Mercer and Morehouse
with only a minute left.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.680
Not a great wave for Morehouse.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.880
Can Tetanui do better?

18:12.320 --> 18:13.560
Let's go Bodhs!

18:16.760 --> 18:18.320
Huge ride
from Tetanui there,

18:18.400 --> 18:21.440
but will it be enough
to put her at the top?

18:23.960 --> 18:25.160
Crazy!

18:30.440 --> 18:32.200
Have they scored
Poppy's last wave yet?

18:32.280 --> 18:33.200
They're still deciding.

18:33.720 --> 18:37.280
Whatever happens,
I'm proud of you,

18:37.360 --> 18:39.840
and I know Mum would be too.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.920
And it's
a 9.8 for Tetanui!

18:48.000 --> 18:50.280
She's nabbed the win!

18:55.480 --> 18:58.160
Bodhi Mercer second,
Morehouse third...

19:19.480 --> 19:22.280
I guess Margot's
dragged Summer back

19:22.360 --> 19:24.080
to Shorehaven already, or?

19:25.600 --> 19:29.240
Actually they both left for
the airport about an hour ago.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.360
What?

19:30.640 --> 19:32.480
She left us a letter.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.760
She put it under
our door this morning.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.480
I mean, it was sort of
a confession, really.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.400
Going back to Stairway,
you running away,

19:42.480 --> 19:43.840
she said it was her idea.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.720
It's so typical.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.640
This whole thing has
just made us realise

19:47.720 --> 19:51.440
bringing her here,
forcing her onto you...

19:51.520 --> 19:53.440
I think it was
a really big mistake.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.000
We think that we might've
been a bit hard on you mate.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.680
So your mum and I,
we decided that,

20:00.760 --> 20:02.960
we're going to let
you surf your final.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.040
Well
there you go, best of luck.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.560
Thank you.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.080
-Ari go!
-Well done brother.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.200
Gearing up for
the Under 16 Boy's Final.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.560
Griff Temple almost
guarantee a place

20:55.800 --> 20:57.320
on the State Team
at this point.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.920
But Shorehaven's Ari Gibson
has been climbing the rankings,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.200
and is within striking distance.

21:04.480 --> 21:08.480
Finalists, this is your
three minute warning.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.920
Good luck out there.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.760
Ari what is it?

21:18.840 --> 21:19.920
I, um...

21:21.240 --> 21:23.560
..I've been having...

21:24.520 --> 21:25.800
Ari!

21:31.640 --> 21:32.640
What is it mate?

21:32.720 --> 21:36.680
Something's really wrong and
I don't know how to fix it.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.720
It's not Summer's fault,

21:37.800 --> 21:39.960
but I have to see her
before she gets on that plane.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.600
Just go Ari.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.760
Enough chat,
we've got a plane to catch.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.360
You okay?

22:09.160 --> 22:10.400
Okay, come on.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.640
Summer! Summer!
Wait! Wait! wait!

22:18.880 --> 22:20.720
Ari!?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.880
I did it, I told
them everything,

22:22.960 --> 22:24.520
they know it wasn't
your fault and, and,

22:24.600 --> 22:27.320
Summer can stay with us,
it's okay.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.440
Mum, can you
give us a second?

22:29.520 --> 22:31.200
Yeah, sure.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.440
Ari,

22:36.640 --> 22:38.480
you were right.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.520
I need to take responsibility
and clean up the mess I've made.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.760
And not just here.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.880
Okay.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.080
I get that but it's not just
that you're allowed to stay,

22:48.160 --> 22:51.360
I kind of need you to stay.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.800
Ari! You're definitely going
to be okay without me.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.400
Your family's amazing.
They've got you on this.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.760
I need to go back home.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.160
Don't miss me too much.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.800
-Oi!
-Hey Gibs!

25:23.880 --> 25:25.640
<i>This is Rockaway Beach.</i>

25:25.720 --> 25:27.600
<i>67th Street exit.</i>
