00:00.001 --> 00:05.704
Spring training was awesome, but
I can't wait to see my friends!

00:05.706 --> 00:08.307
I'm gonna catch up on some
Daring Do with Twilight,

00:08.309 --> 00:10.242
help Applejack make
my favorite cider,

00:10.244 --> 00:12.644
and have a sleepover
with Pinkie!

00:12.646 --> 00:15.347
We get it, you have
a fun week planned.

00:15.349 --> 00:19.718
Meanwhile I'm stuck here running
trials week at the Academy.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.421
But you love yelling and
blowing your whistle.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.289
Yeah. I do.

00:26.326 --> 00:27.526
See you gals later!

00:36.670 --> 00:38.504
Huh? Oh, the map!

00:46.413 --> 00:48.180
Hey Twilight! So
where am I going?

00:48.182 --> 00:50.182
The Crystal Mountains?
Vanhoover? Here?

00:50.184 --> 00:54.553
Well, the good news is we
both got called by the map.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.689
Awesome! Does that
mean there's bad news?

00:57.691 --> 01:00.459
No! Well, not exactly.

01:02.695 --> 01:05.431

All right newbies,
welcome to trials week

01:56.784 --> 01:58.717
for the Wonderbolt Academy!

01:58.719 --> 02:01.620
You'll be judged on your
speed, strength, agility

02:01.622 --> 02:05.257
and technique, culminating
in a final evaluation.

02:05.259 --> 02:09.294
Will it be hard? Yes.
Will you cry? Maybe.

02:09.296 --> 02:12.264
Will you fly so much
your wings fall off?

02:12.266 --> 02:14.333
That has only happened once.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.735
She's just exaggerating
to make a point, right?

02:16.737 --> 02:21.140
I mean, wings can't
really fall off, can they?

02:21.142 --> 02:23.509
You think you've got what it
takes to be an elite flyer?

02:23.511 --> 02:24.510
Yes, ma'am!

02:24.512 --> 02:25.911
Yes, ma'am!

02:25.913 --> 02:29.148
Well, let me tell
you, you don't.

02:29.150 --> 02:32.518
I remember when she
said that to me.

02:34.420 --> 02:39.758
[excited hero-worship chatter]

02:39.760 --> 02:41.827
You don't think Rainbow
Dash is the pony

02:41.829 --> 02:43.562
whose wings fell
off, do you?

02:43.564 --> 02:45.564
[whistle blast]

02:45.566 --> 02:50.202
Quit yer whisperin' and give me
five hundred laps! Go go go!

02:53.206 --> 02:55.274
Um... I just wanted you to know.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.510
You two are my favorite
ponies in all of Equestria.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.780
Well, isn't that sweet. Now
get going on those laps!

03:03.316 --> 03:05.250
Welcome, Princess
Twilight!

03:05.252 --> 03:07.186
What are you doing
back so soon?

03:07.188 --> 03:09.354
Official Friendship business.

03:09.356 --> 03:13.258
Have you noticed anypony having
a hard time with their friends?

03:13.260 --> 03:15.861
Not really. But it's
not my job to worry

03:15.863 --> 03:19.264
about their relationships. I'm
here to make them elite fliers.

03:21.801 --> 03:26.271
Adorable. They're so full
of hope and competition.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.774
Their technique could
use some work, though.

03:28.776 --> 03:32.644
I'm sure they'd appreciate
any notes from you.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.380
Nah. I wouldn't want to
mess with their confidence.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.983
But they'll never get better if
they don't know what to work on.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.752
Sloppy wing placement.
Crooked lines.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.654
I'm gonna have to drill
them on basic technique

03:42.656 --> 03:44.289
in the classroom portion.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.291
Classroom portion?

03:46.293 --> 03:49.494
Yeah. It's everypony's least
favorite part of trial week,

03:49.496 --> 03:51.396
but it has to be done.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.265
Maybe we can help.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.366
We can?

03:54.368 --> 03:58.670
Between your flying skills
and my teaching expertise,

03:58.672 --> 04:02.608
Plus, once they get to know us,
they'll be more comfortable

04:02.610 --> 04:04.576
coming to us with their
friendship problems.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.877
Count us in.

04:05.879 --> 04:06.878
Great!

04:06.880 --> 04:08.013
[tweet]

04:10.550 --> 04:12.684
You have your work
cut out for you.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.890
Thank goodness I had time
to whip up a few charts

04:18.892 --> 04:23.362
It's fresh in my mind from
when I learned to fly.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.496
This is so exciting!

04:25.732 --> 04:28.500
Maybe for you. I
practically fell asleep

04:28.502 --> 04:30.636
when I went through
this. Tell ya what.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.504
I'll leave the
teaching stuff to you

04:32.506 --> 04:34.406
and I'll just make
sure they stay awake.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.708
[blast]

04:36.710 --> 04:38.844
I'm pretty sure their thirst
for knowledge will keep them

04:38.846 --> 04:40.679
bright-eyed and bushy tailed.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.515
[laugh] Good
one, Twilight.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.718
[blast]

04:46.720 --> 04:50.289
Wake up, newbies!
Class is in session.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.890
Hello, students!

04:51.892 --> 04:55.360
I'm Twilight Sparkle and
this is Rainbow Dash.

04:55.362 --> 04:58.797
But you can call us T-Sparks
and the Dashinator!

04:58.799 --> 05:00.299
Twilight: Ahem!

05:00.301 --> 05:02.934
Heh heh. Just kidding.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.704
And we're here to go over
basic flying technique.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.972
Kid: Uggggggh.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.974
Who said that?

05:08.976 --> 05:11.777
Me. I mean, we're here because
we're amazingly awesome

05:11.779 --> 05:16.315
crazy good flyers. We're
waaaaay past basics.

05:16.317 --> 05:17.883
What's your name?

05:17.885 --> 05:21.420
Sky Stinger. You've
never heard of me?

05:21.422 --> 05:22.921
He set the record
for the fastest

05:22.923 --> 05:24.589
vertical acceleration rate.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.859
500 feet in two seconds.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.795
That's pretty impressive.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.096
It's amazing.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.964
Ahem. It is.

05:32.966 --> 05:37.002
And we can talk personal
records after class, Ms--?

05:37.004 --> 05:41.073
Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony.
I never fly without her.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.575
But you'll have to
in the solo trials.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.812
There are solo trials?

05:46.814 --> 05:49.881
Yup. It's a part of
your final evaluation.

05:49.883 --> 05:53.752
We'll ace that test with our
wings tied behind our flanks.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.121
My picture will go
right up there...

05:56.123 --> 05:58.423
...next to yours.

05:58.425 --> 06:02.728
That's a mighty big claim
considering everypony here is an

06:02.730 --> 06:05.597
"amazingly awesome
crazy good flyer."

06:05.599 --> 06:07.132
I know.

06:07.134 --> 06:10.669
[ahem] OK! Let's
get back on track.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.671
Now, who can tell me
the best wing angle

06:12.673 --> 06:14.840
to achieve minimal
air resistance?

06:14.842 --> 06:19.778
[snoring ]

06:19.780 --> 06:23.014
Wake up, newbies!
Class is in session.

06:27.854 --> 06:31.556
[chattering]

06:31.558 --> 06:32.858
Well, there were a
few hiccups,

06:32.860 --> 06:34.626
but overall that
went pretty well.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.561
[noisy yawn]

06:36.563 --> 06:39.164
Yeah. Nopony fell asleep.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.466
What? I'm not
a student!

06:41.468 --> 06:42.868
Hey, teach!

06:42.870 --> 06:45.937
Me? Or Twilight?
Probably Twilight.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.673
Uh, both. About
the solo test,

06:48.675 --> 06:50.575
I'm actually kinda
worried about it.

06:50.577 --> 06:54.513
We all have moments
where we doubt ourselves.

06:54.515 --> 06:58.717
No. No. I have absolutely
zero doubts about myself.

06:58.719 --> 07:02.888
I'm a strong flyer--like
really, really, really strong.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.724
But this isn't about me.
I'm worried for Vapor.

07:05.726 --> 07:10.429
Oh. Well... that is
very... kind? Of you.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.198
Tell you what. It's almost
time for freestyle training.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.700
Why don't you grab her and
show us what you've got?

07:15.702 --> 07:19.438
Yes! Prepare to be
impressed. By me.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.107
Like I said, Vapor
still needs work.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.516
Well, he may be full of
himself but I have to admit,

07:31.518 --> 07:35.654
Sky's an excellent flyer. He
must've shot up 200 feet!

07:35.656 --> 07:39.724
But did you see Vapor Trail?
Her wing was under his.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.927
I think she gave him a boost.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.995
I guess I didn't
even notice Vapor.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.664
I was too busy
watching Sky.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.702
Twilight: [gasp] I
think you're right!

07:50.704 --> 07:53.205
Vapor just created a gust of
wind that caught Sky's wing

07:53.207 --> 07:57.075
at a 45 degree angle, propelling
him into a flipping loop.

07:57.077 --> 08:00.011
Somepony paid
attention in class!

08:00.013 --> 08:03.515
Sky obviously has no
idea he's not actually

08:03.517 --> 08:05.750
"amazingly awesome".

08:05.752 --> 08:07.919
And Vapor's so busy making
her friend look good,

08:07.921 --> 08:10.789
she's not focused on
her own flying at all.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.924
This must be our
friendship problem,

08:12.926 --> 08:17.562
Fix it without
Tell them          telling them!
the truth!

08:22.201 --> 08:23.969
You don't want
to tell them?

08:23.971 --> 08:27.072
Of course not. Flying
is like 30 percent skill

08:27.074 --> 08:28.907
and 70 percent confidence.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.176
You can't mess with
a flier's confidence.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.912
But you can't improve if you
don't think you have to!

08:33.914 --> 08:36.715
Besides, Vapor's keeping a
pretty big secret from Sky

08:36.717 --> 08:38.517
and that can lead
to trouble.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.552
Yeah, but if we tell
them that they've been

08:40.554 --> 08:43.121
holding each other back,
that could be trouble too!

08:43.123 --> 08:45.657
I nailed that
flipping loop.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.692
I'm actually surprised
you're still here;

08:47.694 --> 08:49.794
I thought I blew
you away.

08:49.796 --> 08:53.999
You were [PANT]
great, Sky. [PANT]

08:54.001 --> 08:55.800
Come on, Vapor Trail.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.769
You're going to have to
build up your endurance

08:57.771 --> 08:59.738
if you want a shot
at the Academy.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.641
Wonderbolts don't
get winded.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.744
Angel Wings! You call
that cloud busting?

09:05.746 --> 09:08.680
That cloud barely
knew you were there!

09:08.682 --> 09:11.049
I love my job.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.552
We'll keep working
and who knows?

09:13.554 --> 09:17.589
One day you might come close
to being almost as good as me.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.691
Oh, I don't think so.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.928
You were voted Stratusberg's
Most Promising Flier.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.297
I was voted
Best Sneeze.

09:25.299 --> 09:28.934
You do have a
really great sneeze.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.770
Thanks, Sky. But I don't
think I can sneeze my way

09:31.772 --> 09:35.707
into the Academy.
[sigh] I'm pretty beat.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.008
I'm gonna hit the showers.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.879
You have to help her.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.113
Actually, she's
not the one...

09:42.115 --> 09:43.748
Will do!

09:43.750 --> 09:47.118
♪

09:47.120 --> 09:51.122
Hey, you did great. You're
a really strong flyer.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.124
Me?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.627
Vapor Trail, we know
what you've been doing.

09:55.629 --> 09:59.064
You've been doing... great!

09:59.066 --> 10:02.067
You've been helping Sky.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.169
Uh. I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.705
Sky doesn't need anypony's
help. He's amazing.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.611
Not without you. And it's
gonna be pretty obvious

10:12.613 --> 10:14.679
during the solo trials when
he can't get enough air

10:14.681 --> 10:16.214
to do a flipping loop.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.650
Oh no. I can't let
that happen.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.686
I mean--aww, sugarcubes!

10:21.688 --> 10:23.688
Why are you doing
this for him?

10:23.690 --> 10:28.793
[sigh] It started when we were
kids. You have to understand...

10:28.795 --> 10:32.731
...Sky grew up with a lot
of siblings. It was tough.

10:32.733 --> 10:36.067
He was always trying to
get his parents' attention.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.204
Meanwhile, I was an only child
who hated all the attention

10:39.206 --> 10:41.106
I got from mine.

10:41.108 --> 10:45.176
Mom: Vapor Trail! Where are
you? Do you need a snack?

10:45.178 --> 10:47.078
Do you want to do homework?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.980
Dad: Or we can just spend
some time together!

10:48.982 --> 10:51.816
All day is never enough!

10:51.818 --> 10:56.187
Mom! Dad! Up here! Look, look,
look, look, look, look, hey!

10:56.189 --> 10:58.823
Mom! Dad! Can you see?

11:08.934 --> 11:10.335
[sigh]

11:10.337 --> 11:12.203
That was amazing!

11:20.312 --> 11:23.915
Flying together gave
us both what we wanted.

11:23.917 --> 11:28.286
But I never told Sky how
much I was helping him.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.388
It started with a
small boost here

11:30.390 --> 11:32.724
or a little gust of
wind there.

11:32.726 --> 11:36.327
But I didn't think my help could
actually hurt his chances!

11:36.329 --> 11:39.397
I understand. But now
you're both in trouble.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.733
You need to work
on your tricks.

11:41.735 --> 11:45.737
And Sky needs to be able to fly
without you or he won't make it.

11:45.739 --> 11:48.907
Oh, but he has to! Flying
with the Wonderbolts

11:48.909 --> 11:51.943
has been Sky's dream
ever since he was a colt!

11:51.945 --> 11:53.778
What about you?

11:53.780 --> 11:56.448
I-I guess I haven't
thought about it.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.750
I just want to be
with my best friend.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.252
Then we have to find a
way to help both of you.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.354
Starting with telling
Sky the truth.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.725
No! You can't. Sky
will be crushed.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.160
And without his confidence
he won't fly as well.

12:10.863 --> 12:14.032
[sigh] Then I guess we'll
give Dash's method a shot.

12:14.034 --> 12:19.104
Yes! I love being right.
OK. Here's what we do.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.140
Sky needs to build his strength.
Air drills, wing lifts...

12:22.142 --> 12:24.008

methodical stuff.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.111
Sounds like my
cup of oats.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.179
But how will we
get him to do that?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.448
He doesn't think
he needs practice.

12:30.450 --> 12:34.018
We'll just tell Sky that he
should practice with Twilight

12:34.020 --> 12:35.787
so you won't feel so
self-conscious about getting

12:35.789 --> 12:37.856

you should...

15:58.490 --> 16:00.458
Yeah, they're still mad.

This is all my fault. If we
had just done things your way,

of my most promising students

16:29.189 --> 16:32.023

with a hole in it?

Well, apparently I
need a lot of practice.

some help from my friends,

the Princess of Friendship.

that. Come with me.
