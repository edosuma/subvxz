-[Zooey]
This is what

00:10.344 --> 00:11.724
our future looks like
if Luke doesn’t get back.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.215
-It’s time
to rattle his cage a little.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.887
So, you coming back,
or what?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.175
-Thinking Monday.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.888
-Not every house
has to be a horror show.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.848
[screaming]

00:19.978 --> 00:22.188
Luke, so you’re really just
going to do this yourself?

00:22.314 --> 00:23.574
Screw the process.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.400
-Why were you so nasty
to Susan?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.396
-[Phil] His name
was Edgar Cornell.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.528
He was a serial killer.
He murdered six people.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.075
-Stay back!
-[whoosh]

00:32.199 --> 00:35.079

Okay, you’re gonna
have to go!

01:33.218 --> 01:35.298
Go on! I-I...

01:35.429 --> 01:37.469

02:47.668 --> 02:50.378
Spirit Stalkers:
Paranormal P.I.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.214
I’ll use my link
to the beyond

02:53.632 --> 02:56.552

02:56.677 --> 02:58.507

02:58.970 --> 03:01.890

to this very day.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.846
I’ll walk the very halls

03:06.978 --> 03:08.898
where she committed
her heinous crimes.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.272
I’ll interview experts

03:11.400 --> 03:13.740
with verified
accounts of terror.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.780
-Oh, my goodness.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.074
-Ho!
Did you guys see that?

03:19.324 --> 03:21.534
Tonight, Grace Wexford,

03:21.660 --> 03:24.370
the Were-Lady
of Wexford Manor.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.753
On Spirit Stalkers:
Paranormal P.I.

03:30.377 --> 03:34.257
It’s time to send this she-beast
screaming back to hell.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.716
Gee...

03:37.843 --> 03:39.263
-What?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.926
-Great!
I am out of the moment!

Ileana!

03:44.099 --> 03:45.639
[several people talking]

03:47.853 --> 03:50.313
-Back to one and get a
release on her just in case.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.981
[mysterious score]

03:54.192 --> 03:56.152
-[Luke] I’m just telling you,
Doug, as your agent,

03:56.278 --> 03:57.608
I think you’re
making a mistake

03:57.738 --> 03:59.238
letting these TV people
in your house.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.744
They break things.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.276
-Luke, you’ve had my listing
for two months now.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.120
We still can’t shake this legend
of Grace Wexford,

04:06.246 --> 04:08.956
so I say we turn it
into a positive, lean into it.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.582
Some people like the idea

04:10.709 --> 04:12.129
of moving into a haunted house.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.502
-In my experience,

04:13.628 --> 04:14.958
they are fine with the idea.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.798
It’s the actual bleeding walls

04:16.923 --> 04:18.513
and tormented shrieks
of the damned

04:18.633 --> 04:20.683
that make it hard
to close escrow.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.182
-Spirit Stalkers plays
all over the world.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.684
Some Bulgarian prince could
see this on the TV and say,

04:26.808 --> 04:28.808
[Bulgarian accent]
"I must have that house!"

04:28.935 --> 04:31.345
-Bulgaria is a
parliamentary democracy.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.770
No princes.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.478
-You being a wiseass?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.148
-Sort of. Look, we know
this thing could be dangerous.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.447
-Could be? It nearly slashed
the shirt off my back!

04:40.572 --> 04:42.952
-These people could accidentally
unleash something

04:43.074 --> 04:45.164
they can’t
possibly comprehend.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.365
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:48.079 --> 04:50.289
I don’t know what
you’re talking about,

04:50.415 --> 04:51.825
but I comprehend

04:51.958 --> 04:53.458
comprehensively.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.045
Comprende?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.130
Our latest
ectoprobonometer readings

04:57.255 --> 04:58.715
are coming in at a G4,

04:58.840 --> 05:00.340
maybe even an L5.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.217
-[appreciative whistle]
-That’s not even a thing.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.854
-Frankly, Mister Pedersen,

05:03.970 --> 05:05.680
I’m just glad you didn’t wait
a moment longer

05:05.806 --> 05:07.346
to call in
the professionals.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.846
You may have saved lives.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.517
We haven’t met.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.401
Kit Rampart.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.026
Face, brains, brand

05:19.152 --> 05:20.652

05:21.571 --> 05:23.871
-Luke Roman. I sell houses.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.157
-So, that tall,

05:27.285 --> 05:28.825
gorgeous drink of water

05:28.954 --> 05:31.214
who was in our shot
she’s with you.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.211
You are the
real estate people.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.214
See, you’re already
getting in my way.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.170
-They’re getting in my way.
-They’re really sorry.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.917
-Okay. Well, let’s get
one thing straight:

05:42.050 --> 05:43.840
Anything that goes
bump in the night,

05:43.969 --> 05:45.929
that’s my side of the street.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.564
You don’t tell me my job,

05:47.681 --> 05:49.221
I won’t tell you about carpets

05:49.349 --> 05:51.349
or whatever decking
lasts longest.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.939
-Composite.
-The point is,

05:54.062 --> 05:55.562
you do you,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.229
and leave the ectoplasm to me.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.534
Doug, you made the right call.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.702
I’ll see you
under those bright lights.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.948
Magic!

06:05.073 --> 06:06.913
[Doug chuckles]

06:07.033 --> 06:08.583
Magic.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.587
-So, he’s a bit of a dick
but, uh, play nice, okay?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.421
-I’d hate to have to fire you.
-Well, that’d suck.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.968
-Mr. Pedersen, they’re ready
for your interview.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.052
-Oh. If you’ll excuse me.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.259
Magic time.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.599
[elevator arriving chime]
[elevator doors closing]

06:37.022 --> 06:38.612

Hi./Hi.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.780
[Luke clears throat]

06:41.568 --> 06:43.818
-So, Wexford’s moving forward
with the TV show.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.574
So, I think we take a step back,
we pivot and we let Kit Rampart

06:47.699 --> 06:49.239
give Doug
his 15 minutes of fame.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.617
-[gentle score]
-You really think that’s best?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.965
-Being seen in the same universe
as Spirit Stalkers

06:54.080 --> 06:56.830
does serious damage
to our brand, so, yeah.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.003
What?

07:03.381 --> 07:04.801
-I understand.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.635
I do.
You’re threatened.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.300
Without your--your special
"ground control to Major Tom,"

07:10.430 --> 07:12.310
you feel more like
Kit the Spirit Stalker

07:12.432 --> 07:14.312
than you want to admit.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.153
-Well, that’s just mean.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.654
-Sometimes
the truth is...

07:23.526 --> 07:24.986
mean.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.951
-[Zooey] Hey.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.714
-Oh, Zooey,
this message is for Luke.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.996
-Is it?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.500
-The Baumgartners.
Ted and Diane.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.169
Why are they calling Luke?

07:45.131 --> 07:47.511
-Luke said he wanted
everything routed through him.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.304
But I figured
they’re your clients, right?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.354
-Yes, they are.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.016
[Susan sighs]

08:00.730 --> 08:02.230
Thank you.

[click, hissing]

08:24.629 --> 08:26.049
Auggie?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.262
Are you free this weekend?
I need help with a PKT

08:28.383 --> 08:30.763
for the Baumgartners.
They’re that sweet couple

08:30.885 --> 08:32.885
who bought the B&B
up on the coast.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.723
-What seems
to be the problem?

08:34.848 --> 08:37.728
-Mm. "Voices,
rattling chandeliers,

08:37.851 --> 08:40.061
ghastly, murderous screams
in the night."

08:40.186 --> 08:42.896
Not ideal for a
relaxing weekend retreat.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.773
Can you help me?

08:44.899 --> 08:47.029
-Well, I have a, uh,
fencing match Saturday

08:47.152 --> 08:48.902
that can easily be moved.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.909
Saturday nights
I play with a jazz combo

08:51.031 --> 08:52.451
at a spot uptown.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.084
They could have
someone less gifted sit in.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.251
Sunday nights I play poker
with some old friends,

08:59.330 --> 09:02.080
but they can keep their money
a week longer.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.803
-As long as you’re not busy.
Pick you up around noon?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.880
-Ah, I still have to pop by
your Ensom house

09:08.006 --> 09:09.416
for its own PKT.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.219
-Don’t worry about my place.
It’ll keep.

was trying to hide

09:29.402 --> 09:31.652
Grace Wexford’s crimes.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.280
According to legend,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.947
this is where she
exhumed her father’s body

09:37.077 --> 09:39.657
and feasted on his
barely cold remains

09:39.788 --> 09:42.458
with her unspeakably large,
sharp teeth.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.094
That top window
was her bedroom;

09:47.212 --> 09:51.342
a perfect view of the graves
that drove her mad with hunger.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.675
It’s said on nights
just like this one,

09:54.803 --> 09:58.263
you can hear her shovel
digging through the wet earth.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.269
[scraping]

10:00.391 --> 10:02.101
Can you hear it?

10:02.227 --> 10:03.767
Sh, sh, sh.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.652
-The shovel.
-[metal scraping]

10:06.773 --> 10:08.523
The shovel!
It’s coming from just o--

10:08.650 --> 10:10.780
-[dramatic boom]
-Ah!

10:10.902 --> 10:15.112
Ah, God. I’m sorry, can we
take this again really quick?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.780
This isn’t working.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.698
-[Director] What was wrong
with that one?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.827
-The shovel sounds
are all wrong. It--

10:21.371 --> 10:22.961
It is supposed to sound

10:23.081 --> 10:25.671
like a girl unearthing
her rotting father,

10:25.792 --> 10:27.212
ready to feast on him.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.995
It sounds like
you’re planting azaleas.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.170
Can we give it
some gravitas?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.838
-Well, I’m sorry.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.507
The shovel that
studied at Juilliard was booked.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.216
-If you’re going to make me
fake this shit

10:38.346 --> 10:40.346
at least give me
a chance to make it good!

10:40.473 --> 10:42.353
-We’ve been over this.
We don’t have time

10:42.475 --> 10:43.845
for the real thing.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.517
So get rolling
because we’re burning moonlight.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.015
-There is something here.
I can feel it.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.728
We can make it real
this time!

10:49.858 --> 10:51.898
-As you say every time!

10:52.026 --> 10:53.736
I can’t make a show
that way.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.152
-What about the truth?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.160
-Ah-ha! The truth?

10:57.282 --> 11:00.372
Once you fake that,
you can fake anything.

Great shoveling, Denny.

[hums rhythmically]

12:27.330 --> 12:32.960
Red leather, yellow leather,
good blood, bad blood.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.626
[humming and blowing lips]

12:38.049 --> 12:41.089
Vocal warmups.
Tuning my instrument.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.679
-You might want to
use your instrument

12:42.804 --> 12:45.184
to remind your people
that this is somebody’s home.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.806
[cup hits garbage can]

12:46.933 --> 12:49.643
-Grace the Were-Lady.
Can you feel her?

12:50.895 --> 12:54.515
I can. It’s my seventh sense,
the substance of my being.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.069
-That substance
smells a lot like horseshit.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.653
[Kit chuckles]

12:58.778 --> 13:01.528
-Ghost Hunting 101:
you don’t hunt,

13:01.656 --> 13:03.276
you let it come to you.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.448
Nowadays, every kid
with a spectrograph

13:05.576 --> 13:07.116
thinks they’re Lorraine Warren.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.167
Touch, feel, finesse;
that’s what it takes.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.171
-I don’t think you know
what you’re talking about.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.843
-Hm.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.126
Terranova Cemetery,
Savannah, G-A.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.179
A poltergeist tossed
a broken pop bottle...

13:23.303 --> 13:26.313
Huh?
Three inches from my aorta.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.141
Yeah. Don’t see that kind of
excitement and danger

13:29.267 --> 13:30.807
in real estate, do ya?

13:33.229 --> 13:34.809
-Four-bedroom Craftsman.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.569
Minute hand shot off the
grandfather clock, cut me here.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.613
Four-point-seven inches
closer to my femoral artery,

13:41.738 --> 13:43.528
I’d never dance
professionally again.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.616
-Ooh! A ghost
did that to you.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.282
-Yeah.
-[Kit scoffs]

13:49.912 --> 13:51.962
-Emily’s Bridge,
Stowe, Vermont.

13:52.081 --> 13:56.291
This gnarled old hand with claws
grabbed my leg.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.249
Hurt like hell.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.009
-Gnarled old hand.
-Yeah.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.131
-Probably looked a lot like
a tree branch.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.718
-To the untrained eye.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.641
-Ooh.
-Split-level bungalow,

14:10.767 --> 14:12.227
Palo Alto, California,

14:12.352 --> 14:14.022

14:14.145 --> 14:15.775

third-acre.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.397
Demon with the head of a pig

14:17.523 --> 14:19.983
tried to pull me
into a convection oven.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.569
I had to pry his jaws off

14:21.694 --> 14:24.534
while my associate
read scripture in Latin.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.195
[Kit laughs]

14:26.783 --> 14:29.083
-Ha. God, is it that late?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.702
-Oh, the watch runs
a little fast since, you know,

14:31.829 --> 14:33.289
the thing
with the pig-demon.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.964
-I have to
get back on set.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.175
-Look, I’ve seen your show...

14:40.129 --> 14:41.669
And I don’t
believe a word of it.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.974
-All this was before the show.

14:45.093 --> 14:48.683
Back when I was just a kid
with a camcorder and a gift.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.265
[gentle score]

14:50.390 --> 14:52.850
It was all real
all the time.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.058
Spirits used to be
everywhere.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.647
All over me.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.482
-So why’d you start faking it?
What happened?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.570
-Success happened.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.993
Episode orders got bigger,
schedules got tighter.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.823
Tandem units!

15:07.323 --> 15:09.243
Couldn’t wait
for the magic to happen.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.367
Had to kinda,
you know...

15:12.078 --> 15:13.868
help it along.
Fake it to make it.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.535
-You must’ve hated that.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.211
-Worst part
is the silence.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.590
-Tell me about it.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.844
-I feel like I used to be

15:25.967 --> 15:29.547
surrounded
by legitimate phenomena.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.772
But look at me...

15:32.890 --> 15:36.190
explaining moral compromise
to a real estate guy.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.736
-[August] Doesn’t Luke need you
for the Wexford property?

15:50.199 --> 15:53.079
-[Susan] Luke doesn’t seem to
need me for anything these days.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.246
-[August] Oh, by the way,

15:55.371 --> 15:58.421
I drove past your house.
It’s quite something.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.627
-It’s funny, when clients
can’t find the right house,

16:01.752 --> 16:04.172
I always tell them
it’s out there.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.627
-Mm.
-The house that gets you.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.303
That loves you.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.677
-When Darla and I
were first married,

16:11.804 --> 16:14.604
we rented this tiny place.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.434
[gentle score]

16:16.559 --> 16:18.229
Danielle came along

16:18.352 --> 16:21.022
and the place
instantly seemed smaller.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.687
-What did you do?

16:23.399 --> 16:25.279
-I got a real job.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.902
An assembly plant.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.820
-Ah, what a waste.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.949
-Perhaps.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.410
But that job

16:37.955 --> 16:40.915
enabled me to buy a house
for my wife and daughters.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.548
It was small and austere

16:44.670 --> 16:47.210
and the windows
badly needed caulking,

16:48.424 --> 16:51.894
but it embraced my family
like a grandmother’s hug

16:52.970 --> 16:55.220
and we lived there 17 years.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.645
And the day we moved out
of that house into something

17:00.520 --> 17:03.400
much larger and more grand
was one of the three--

17:04.148 --> 17:05.688
no,

17:06.108 --> 17:08.278
four times

17:08.402 --> 17:09.992
in my adult life

17:12.198 --> 17:13.658
that I’ve wept.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.333
-Hm.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.503
Something about home.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.536
-[Diane] It was our
little corner of heaven.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.670
-[Ted] And then
the screaming started.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.837
The voices,
the shaking.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.427
-Only on Saturdays?

17:32.552 --> 17:34.342
-Saturday nights. Late.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.010
-[mysterious score]
-Sounds so...

17:36.597 --> 17:39.727
desperate, so agonized,
no one can sleep.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.440
-The customers leave so fast

17:41.561 --> 17:43.021
they don’t even stay
for breakfast.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.645
-We’re supposed to
be a bed and breakfast.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.652
-So, at best,
we’re just a bed.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.694
-You can get a bed
anywhere.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.028
-At a much
lower price point.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.784
-So you’ve, uh, checked
where the noises come from?

17:55.533 --> 17:57.243
-It’s all over the house.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.327
-My associate and I
will look a little closer.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.124
Are we alone in the house
this evening?

18:02.248 --> 18:04.118
-We don’t have any bookings.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.960
Which is, you know,
kind of the point.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.210
[exhale]

18:12.800 --> 18:14.680
-[August] Something is here.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.468
Watching.
And waiting.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.100
-Okay, this is the money shot,
people.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.767
Kit is gonna set up
the communing-with-Grace bit,

18:25.896 --> 18:27.606
recite a little
of the spooky rhyme.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.822
Great job, research team,
for turning that up.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.032
Then when he’s finished, bang!
Special effects trips the rig,

18:33.154 --> 18:36.204

as if thrown by the spirit.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.124
Camera, make sure
you’re in position.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.542
This is teaser material,
people!

18:41.412 --> 18:42.962
Any reason
not to roll camera?

18:43.914 --> 18:45.794
-Well, you have a
full glass of wine

18:45.916 --> 18:47.996
waiting to tip over
in an abandoned house.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.341
Anybody bumping on that?
Heh.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.678
And... Action!

18:58.638 --> 19:00.348
-There’s a nursery rhyme

19:00.473 --> 19:03.183

soon after Grace died.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.194
Our detailed records
show the phenomena

19:06.312 --> 19:08.192
first appeared
not too long after.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.734
It seemed to summon her.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.738
That’s why
we’re in Grace’s bedroom,

19:13.861 --> 19:16.861
where her life force
is most concentrated.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.319
It’s the perfect place
to reach out.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.368
Let’s see
what she has to say.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.173
Grace, Grace

19:26.749 --> 19:28.379
Teeth and lace.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.706
Eyes of black
and soulless face.

19:33.172 --> 19:37.182
Hide your loved ones,
hide your dears.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.721
She’ll eat your sons
and drink your tears.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.925
Whoa!
Did-did you guys see that?

19:45.976 --> 19:48.266
-Okay, let’s go again.
Can we shut that window?

19:48.396 --> 19:51.516
-No! No, no!
Keep rolling.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.689
The window’s closed.
We never opened it.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.900
Grace Wexford,

19:56.529 --> 19:59.569
are you here now
with us in this room?

20:02.284 --> 20:05.584

presence known! Speak!

had any of the magic

21:27.453 --> 21:30.213

you’re killing me

22:09.328 --> 22:11.198

boring death.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.580
Where’s the sexy,
salacious stuff from your books?

22:13.707 --> 22:16.747

I had to look up
that last one.

deserves to be told.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.952

what I need on cards.

I swear, it was
like old times.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.952
I was hearing the voices,

39:29.075 --> 39:31.735
Grace whispering
sweet things in my ear.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.909
The real thing.
For just a second,

it wasn’t about me,
or the sponsors, or the network.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.546

around 1870.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.027

-Oh.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.447
-In a shipwreck
on a Saturday night.

40:53.576 --> 40:56.826
And Gisela spent the rest
of her life here, just...

40:56.955 --> 41:00.085
standing at that window,
waiting for her love to return.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.248

about home.

It’s the ultimate
romantic getaway.
