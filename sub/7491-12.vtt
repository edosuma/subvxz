00:02.959 --> 00:05.291
All right, guys, your homework
was to watch the video

00:05.375 --> 00:07.542
of the "soaring crow" kata.

00:07.625 --> 00:09.041
Let's see what you got.

00:09.458 --> 00:11.250
And... Begin.

00:16.709 --> 00:18.458
None of you watched the video.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.583
Rudy, we're really busy at school.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.959
We're really busy with school.

00:25.417 --> 00:28.000
You want to feel pressure?
Wait till you're my age.

00:29.208 --> 00:32.333
Trust me, no one gives you an award
for being an adult.

00:32.417 --> 00:33.834
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

00:33.917 --> 00:36.208

00:37.792 --> 00:39.000
What do you mean?

00:39.083 --> 00:42.250
Seaford high is inducting me
into its hall of fame.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.000
Why?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.375
Starting to lose it.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.000
Someone please read this.

00:48.083 --> 00:49.625
Read it with some pizzazz.

00:49.709 --> 00:51.792

00:57.125 --> 00:58.834
In your face, mother!

00:58.917 --> 01:01.625
And they're giving you
a black tie pork chop dinner!

01:01.917 --> 01:03.083
Black tie?

01:03.458 --> 01:04.542
Pork chops?

01:05.375 --> 01:07.000

Hey, guys.

01:52.583 --> 01:54.083
I have favor to ask for you.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.000
My niece, Mika,

01:55.083 --> 01:56.709
she moved here from Hachmakistan.

01:56.792 --> 01:58.917
She will be ninth grader
in your learning house.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.417
And I was wondering if you

02:00.500 --> 02:01.917
would make the friendships with her.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.917
- Oh, yeah. Sure, man.
- Yeah, of course.

02:04.000 --> 02:04.917
Oh, thanks.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.458
There is something that
I need to tell you though.

02:07.792 --> 02:09.625
I love her very much, but...

02:09.834 --> 02:11.542
She is, how do you say...

02:11.834 --> 02:13.583
Ugly like a pig.

02:15.625 --> 02:16.500
<i>I will show you.</i>

02:16.583 --> 02:18.041
Let me summon the beast.

02:32.959 --> 02:35.583
That is not her.
That is my new busboy, Rafael.

02:37.834 --> 02:39.458
That is Mika.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.625
She is not like the beauties

02:50.709 --> 02:51.959
that we have in my country.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.959
Poor thing, with her separate eyebrows,

02:54.041 --> 02:55.250
hairless nose,

02:55.291 --> 02:56.542
and complete...

02:56.834 --> 02:58.542
lack of tail.

03:00.834 --> 03:02.041
Whoa.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.208
Swag.

03:03.291 --> 03:05.959
Mika, these are the boys
that I was telling you about.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.834
The ones who do the...

03:08.458 --> 03:10.041
Nice to meet you.

03:10.125 --> 03:11.792
What it do, Mika?

03:12.041 --> 03:13.000
<i>Okay, come.</i>

03:13.083 --> 03:14.667
I'm going to teach you how
to make sandwich.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.375
Okay. Bye-bye, boys.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.583
Phil's niece is hot!

03:23.875 --> 03:26.125
I just autographed my first baby.

03:27.125 --> 03:28.458
When his mom gets out of the bathroom,

03:28.542 --> 03:30.333
she is going to be so proud!

03:31.500 --> 03:33.250
Wait, so you signed a baby?

03:33.792 --> 03:35.291
Right across the face.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.709
" <i>Got some more pictures of me</i> "

03:37.792 --> 03:39.959
from my hall of fame induction video.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.792
Rudy, I think we have enough.

03:41.875 --> 03:45.083
We went through your school records,
photos, and video clips.

03:45.166 --> 03:46.875
Yeah, we got a great five minutes.

03:46.959 --> 03:48.000
Five minutes?

03:48.083 --> 03:49.834
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:49.917 --> 03:51.083
That's not gonna work.

03:53.291 --> 03:55.542
Don't forget, this night is about me

03:55.625 --> 03:56.583
and me alone.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.417
<i>Whoa, this isn't good.</i>

03:58.917 --> 04:00.834
Rudy, you have a problem here.

04:00.917 --> 04:02.875
According to this, you missed five days

04:02.959 --> 04:04.542
of mandatory attendance in ninth grade.

04:04.625 --> 04:05.792
Yeah, and?

04:06.125 --> 04:08.000
That means...

04:08.542 --> 04:10.875
Technically you didn't
complete high school.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.291
<i>Wait.</i>

04:12.667 --> 04:13.792
If he didn't graduate,

04:13.875 --> 04:16.792
then he's not eligible
to be in the Seaford High hall of fame.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.125
What?

04:19.709 --> 04:20.917
<i>What kind of animal</i>

04:21.000 --> 04:22.291
<i>would sign a baby's face?</i>

04:22.417 --> 04:23.792
We should probably get him out of here.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.834
You're the chairman
of the hall of fame committee.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.208
Can't you do something?

04:32.291 --> 04:33.917
I'm sorry, but your friends are right.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.667
You can't be in the hall of fame, Rudy.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.166
Please? Isn't there anything I can do?

04:38.542 --> 04:39.875
Well...

04:39.959 --> 04:41.667
There may be one thing.

04:42.875 --> 04:43.875
What's up?

04:43.959 --> 04:44.875
How's it going?

04:44.959 --> 04:46.375
Slap me some skin.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.458
All right, all right, I feel you.

04:48.542 --> 04:50.125
Wow.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.667
Rudy, you've actually come back to school.

04:52.875 --> 04:53.709
Yeah.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.709
I was the king here, once.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.542
Figured I'd spend five days

04:57.625 --> 04:59.041
back on the throne.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.834
Oh, my father once spent five days

05:00.917 --> 05:02.709
on the throne after he had cajun food.

05:04.792 --> 05:08.917
Well, guys. You got one week to learn
all you can from the king of cool.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.250
Will one of you guys please help me?

05:22.041 --> 05:24.166
So, uh, Mika...

05:24.625 --> 05:25.959
Maybe we could go out?

05:26.041 --> 05:27.625
Oh, Jerry.

05:27.709 --> 05:28.875
I like you very much,

05:28.959 --> 05:30.250
but I'm not ready for that.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.917
You will always be a very special friend.

05:39.083 --> 05:40.542
What?

05:42.041 --> 05:44.458
So it's true what everyone
is saying about you?

05:44.875 --> 05:47.166
That I got caught making out with
my uncle's bowling glove?

05:48.959 --> 05:49.959
No...

05:50.250 --> 05:51.166
Oh, okay, good.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.750
Yeah... 'Cause that never happened.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.542
Everyone is saying
that you and Mika are going out.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.208
I even heard Kathy Coburn say

06:00.291 --> 06:02.041
that if you can get a girl like Mika,

06:02.125 --> 06:04.000
it puts you in a whole new league.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.208
Well...

06:13.291 --> 06:15.208
I am in a new league.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.583
A brand-new league.

06:17.667 --> 06:21.458
Yeah, Mika and I
are boyfriend and girlfriend.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.291
Taken.

06:23.542 --> 06:24.792
Taken.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.709
Should have put a ring on it, Margaret.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.792
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

06:31.917 --> 06:34.709
I remember health class.

06:36.125 --> 06:38.291
I wonder if my
old girlfriend's still here.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.417
There she is.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.250
Hello, beautiful.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.667
Rudy, I wouldn't touch that thing.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.834
It's a 40-year-old slobberbag.

06:53.917 --> 06:55.834
This doll is not a slobberbag.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.792
It's designed to teach you cpr.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.750
Watch and learn.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.834
- Rudy, I--
- Jack.

07:04.208 --> 07:05.667
After pinching her nostrils,

07:05.750 --> 07:08.041
you use your breath
to fill her lungs with life.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.291
Ru...

07:13.417 --> 07:16.041
Rudy, are you sure
you're doing this right?

07:16.125 --> 07:17.083
Yes.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.750
Now, her stomach is filling up with air.

07:18.834 --> 07:20.166
Gently apply some pressure.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.375
- I am not touching--
- Do it!

07:21.458 --> 07:23.291
There's a life at stake!

07:30.375 --> 07:32.458
Little too much pressure, Jack.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.875
What is going on here?

07:39.208 --> 07:40.166
Learning.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.792
Learning's going on here.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.083
- Uh-huh.
- And who might...

07:48.166 --> 07:49.291
you be?

07:50.709 --> 07:53.000
I'm Bethany Applebaum,

07:53.083 --> 07:54.000
the teacher.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.709
I'm Rudy Gillespie,

07:56.166 --> 07:57.667
the teacher's pet.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.834
Oh, right.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.500
You're the student
who came back to graduate.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.709
Finishing your education.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.792
That is so...

08:08.333 --> 08:09.625
Adorable.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.417
Come here.

08:13.917 --> 08:16.250
Hello, Bethany.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.834
Who's this loser?

08:19.709 --> 08:21.083
He's not a loser, Martin.

08:21.208 --> 08:23.250
He's my student.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.667
I'm coach Funderburk.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.208
Me and Bethany kind of have a thing.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.625
No! No. We don't.

08:29.834 --> 08:30.750
There is no thing--

08:30.834 --> 08:31.917
Pretty big thing!

08:32.000 --> 08:33.750
Everybody's talking about it.

08:35.834 --> 08:36.709
Um...

08:36.792 --> 08:40.709
Rudy, I think you're having a reaction
to that 40-year-old phlegm?

08:41.792 --> 08:42.917
<i>So, Bethany.</i>

08:43.000 --> 08:44.041
You want to split a panini?

08:44.125 --> 08:45.250
I already ate, Martin.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.875
I'd get in on that panini.

08:46.959 --> 08:48.583
You're not touching my panini.

08:48.667 --> 08:49.959
So...

08:50.041 --> 08:51.250
Step off.

08:52.458 --> 08:55.291
Yeah, I think you should probably get
to the nurse's office.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.875
Yeah, you should go.

08:57.125 --> 08:57.959
All right.

08:58.041 --> 08:58.959
I'll go.

08:59.041 --> 09:01.458
But because m'lady asked me.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.625
Not because of you.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.875
And certainly not because

09:04.959 --> 09:07.166
of the excruciating, burning sensation

09:07.250 --> 09:09.458
that is taking over my entire face.

09:21.750 --> 09:22.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.166
Roll your slow.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.500
You are angry at the Jerry?

09:27.583 --> 09:28.583
Yes.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.625
Guess what he has been saying about me?

09:31.500 --> 09:33.750
That you are a two-browed,
pig-faced beast?

09:33.834 --> 09:34.917
I know.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.959
No. He has been walking around school

09:37.041 --> 09:39.000
telling people that I'm his girlfriend.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.166
Oh, he must pay.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.291
He has dishonored our family name.

09:47.208 --> 09:49.834
Well, I have a plan to get back at him.

09:52.875 --> 09:53.834
Ooh.

09:53.917 --> 09:56.709
You are as sneaky as you are ugly.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.125
Sweet!

10:06.208 --> 10:08.583
My old gym uniform still fits.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.166
<i>Well, well.</i>

10:11.250 --> 10:12.542
Happy to see you,

10:12.625 --> 10:14.959
Pudy.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.667
Uh, for your information,

10:16.750 --> 10:17.875
my name is Rudy.

10:17.959 --> 10:19.041
Says so right here.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.458
Part of the "R" fell off,

10:24.542 --> 10:26.041
so it does say "Pudy."

10:30.125 --> 10:31.667
Let's play a little dodgeball.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.959
Jocks against nerds.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.250
All right,

10:35.291 --> 10:37.375
let's annihilate these geeks!

10:37.458 --> 10:38.959
You're with them, Pudy.

10:47.667 --> 10:48.750
All right, guys. Don't worry.

10:48.834 --> 10:49.959
There's five of us.

10:50.041 --> 10:51.583
All right, there's four of us.

10:51.667 --> 10:52.667
There's three of us.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.000
Two. There's two of us, and...

10:56.875 --> 10:58.709
All right, it's Rudy time.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.125
Come on, men!

11:07.709 --> 11:08.750
<i>Come on.</i>

11:18.667 --> 11:20.083
Step aside.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.917
Oh, yeah.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.792
<i>Oh, face!</i>

11:24.875 --> 11:26.583
<i>Literally!</i>

11:27.792 --> 11:29.792
It's Funderburk time, Pudy.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.083
Rudy, are you okay?

11:34.709 --> 11:35.834
Oh.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.333
I gotta give Rudy credit.

11:42.417 --> 11:44.834
This hall of fame thing
is really important to him,

11:44.917 --> 11:46.250
and he's really hanging in there.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.041
Rudy's tough. He'll never let you see
it's getting to him.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.250
<i>Whoops.</i>

11:55.291 --> 11:57.750
Pudy! Pudy!

11:57.834 --> 12:00.125
Pudy! Pudy! Pudy!

12:00.208 --> 12:01.709
Aw, shut it!

12:02.583 --> 12:03.625
That's it!

12:04.041 --> 12:05.792
Stupid classes.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.458
Stupid school!

12:07.542 --> 12:08.917
Stupid...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.041
Fork jammed into my thigh!

12:15.125 --> 12:16.291
I'm done.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.625
I'm dropping out of high school.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.166
Come on, Rudy. You can't
drop out of school.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.750
You won't get into the hall of fame.

12:28.834 --> 12:29.667
I don't care.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.959
School is a mean, dark place.

12:32.041 --> 12:34.291
And if you kids had half a brain
in your heads,

12:34.375 --> 12:35.875
You'd drop out, too!

12:38.959 --> 12:41.542
Rudy, I had a teacher once.

12:41.625 --> 12:42.875
And he always taught me

12:42.959 --> 12:45.083
that no matter how difficult something is,

12:45.959 --> 12:46.875
you can't quit.

12:46.959 --> 12:48.875
School seems difficult now,

12:48.959 --> 12:50.709
but in a couple of days
you'll be through it

12:50.792 --> 12:51.792
and in the hall of fame.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.542
You've helped us all.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.458
And tons of other kids.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.458
You should be in the hall of fame.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.542
And I'll help you get there.

12:59.792 --> 13:01.291
We'll all help you.

13:02.417 --> 13:03.375
Thanks, guys.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.959
It really means a lot.

13:08.125 --> 13:11.041
So, I've been thinking about
what you asked me,

13:11.125 --> 13:12.625
and perhaps I would date you.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.375
Really?

13:14.500 --> 13:18.291
Yes. But first, you must
perform certain Hachmaki dating rituals.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.417
Okay.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.709
You will begin by drinking a bowl
of samasuka.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.417
To young love.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.583
You like it, Jerry?

13:44.166 --> 13:45.500
<i>It is yak urine.</i>

13:47.792 --> 13:48.959
What?

13:51.667 --> 13:52.875
Wait, so...

13:52.959 --> 13:55.750
Are we, like, boyfriend
and girlfriend for real now?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.333
Almost, just 27 rituals to go.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.375
Next up is the salmon slap.

14:00.458 --> 14:01.959
What the heck is a salmon--

14:07.500 --> 14:08.959
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

14:10.792 --> 14:11.667
Class.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.542
Stop talking, please?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.083
Hey.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.375
Your teacher said stop talking.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.041
Punks!

14:24.000 --> 14:26.291
Rudy, you've come back.

14:26.375 --> 14:27.792
Yes, I did.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.500
And I just wanted you to know

14:29.583 --> 14:30.959
that after class I was hoping to...

14:31.041 --> 14:33.083
clap your erasers.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.250
Oh.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.458
I'd like that.

14:38.959 --> 14:40.583
I'd like that a lot.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.291
I, uh, brought you this.

14:58.208 --> 15:00.417
Is anybody else as creeped out as I am?

15:04.792 --> 15:06.041
If you are my boyfriend,

15:06.125 --> 15:09.041
you must wear the traditional Hachmaki
courting outfit.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.291
Quick question.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.583
What's up with the jellyfish underpants?

15:21.667 --> 15:24.792
Every step I take, they sting!

15:27.250 --> 15:28.959
It is tradition.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.041
See you later.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.291
Hmm.

15:37.125 --> 15:38.959
Stay strong for love, Jerry.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.959
It can't get any worse.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.375
It just got worse.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.500
<i>♪ Here we go, let's start the party ♪</i>

15:49.583 --> 15:51.291
<i>♪ Chop it up like it's karate ♪</i>

15:52.208 --> 15:53.542
Well, Pudy.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.291
Looks like the only thing standing
between you

15:57.375 --> 16:00.875
and a hall of fame pork chop dinner
is passing my class.

16:01.166 --> 16:02.458
Oh, I'll pass it.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.500
I went through your records.

16:04.583 --> 16:07.792
And it seems there's one thing
you couldn't complete.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.000
So, your final exam is--

16:10.083 --> 16:11.041
Not the rope climb!

16:11.125 --> 16:13.625
Oh, I was gonna have you do 10 sit-ups.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.583
But rope climb it is!

16:21.166 --> 16:22.291
Here it is.

16:22.792 --> 16:26.792
I scraped all the gum
from the bottom of every desk in school.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.417
Oh, Jerry, before you...

16:29.500 --> 16:30.959
No, no, no. No.

16:31.041 --> 16:33.041
The last requirement on your list

16:33.250 --> 16:34.917
was for me to eat this gum.

16:36.041 --> 16:37.625
Let's do this.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.709
Jerry, all those rituals I had you do...

16:47.792 --> 16:49.208
I made them up.

16:49.583 --> 16:50.583
What?

16:50.875 --> 16:54.625
Well, you lied and told the entire school
I was your girlfriend.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.125
Wait, you knew about that?

16:57.208 --> 16:58.291
I did.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.291
I'm not dumb foreign girl.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.542
So all the stuff I've been through

17:03.625 --> 17:05.125
was just to get back at me?

17:05.208 --> 17:07.250
Yes, it was.

17:07.959 --> 17:10.583
Ohh...

17:15.500 --> 17:18.250
I think you're the coolest chick
I've ever met.

17:19.417 --> 17:22.083
You went through an awful lot
to be my boyfriend.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.959
Maybe we should try it for real.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.458
I got my first girlfriend.

17:28.542 --> 17:30.041
Whoo!

17:45.500 --> 17:47.542
I don't think I can do this.

17:47.625 --> 17:48.917
Don't look down.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.667
Don't look down, Rudy.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.000
Come on, Rudy.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.709
You can do this.

17:56.792 --> 17:58.625
Your kids believe in you.

17:58.709 --> 18:00.250
And I believe in you.

18:00.583 --> 18:01.709
You do?

18:01.792 --> 18:03.125
Yeah, I do.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.792
Get up that rope and ring that bell!

18:07.333 --> 18:08.458
When you get down,

18:08.542 --> 18:10.208
I'll have this waiting for you.

18:14.959 --> 18:16.792
Did you just take out your teeth?

18:17.625 --> 18:19.834
What? No.

18:19.917 --> 18:20.917
It's a kiss.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.125
- Oh.
-

18:22.208 --> 18:23.625
Right, no, that makes way more sense.

18:24.917 --> 18:25.959
I'm gonna go.

18:26.041 --> 18:28.208
Come on, Rudy.
All right. you've got this,

18:28.291 --> 18:29.125
come on, Rudy!

18:29.208 --> 18:30.875
- Climb that rope.
Come on, Rudy.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.166
You've got it! Come on, Rudy!

18:35.250 --> 18:36.542
- Go, go!
- Come on, Rudy!

18:41.709 --> 18:42.875
Listen up, class.

18:42.959 --> 18:46.792
The first person to knock Pudy
off of that rope with one of these balls

18:46.875 --> 18:49.291
doesn't have to run laps
for the rest of the year!

18:49.625 --> 18:51.458
- Take him down!
- Get the Pudy!

18:51.542 --> 18:52.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Eddie!

18:52.625 --> 18:55.250
Eddie! Are you really gonna
knock Rudy off that rope?

18:55.291 --> 18:56.750
To get out of running laps,

18:56.834 --> 18:58.834
I'd knock my mother off that rope.

18:58.917 --> 19:00.542
No! No, Eddie.

19:01.542 --> 19:02.542
Right there!

19:04.542 --> 19:05.959
On his arms.

19:06.041 --> 19:07.125
Knock his hands off!

19:08.250 --> 19:09.166
<i>Come on!</i>

19:09.250 --> 19:10.250
- <i>Hit him!</i>
-

19:11.792 --> 19:12.792
That's it.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.417
Throw it right there on his arms!

19:17.500 --> 19:18.667
Hit him in. Come on!

19:20.000 --> 19:21.291
Aah!

19:22.166 --> 19:23.542
I don't think I can do it, Jack.

19:23.625 --> 19:24.792
Don't you quit on me now, Rudy.

19:24.875 --> 19:25.917
You're so close.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
You gotta keep going.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.375
Get out of there.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
Oh!

19:45.208 --> 19:46.458
Yes!

19:46.542 --> 19:47.792

19:52.792 --> 19:53.834

19:53.917 --> 19:54.917
Thank you very much.

19:55.792 --> 19:59.458
Wow. That was one
amazing story, Dr. Hanft.

19:59.792 --> 20:01.583
You saved more than a village.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.625
You saved 10,000 lives.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.834
Up next is Rudy Gillespie,

20:07.917 --> 20:09.125
a karate guy.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.583
Thank you so much, chairman.

20:13.667 --> 20:14.875
Um...

20:14.959 --> 20:18.834
I could begin the story of my life
by starting with the day I was born,

20:18.917 --> 20:21.291
but that wouldn't be fair to you...

20:21.417 --> 20:23.834
For my story begins

20:23.917 --> 20:26.542
when my great, great, great grandfather

20:26.625 --> 20:27.834
Jebbidiah Gillespie

20:27.917 --> 20:30.542
came to America
with nothing in his pocket,

20:30.625 --> 20:33.834
but a spare pocket
in case the first one ripped.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.875
<i>And rip it did.</i>

20:37.875 --> 20:39.875
That is why I am the greatest person

20:39.959 --> 20:41.625

20:41.959 --> 20:42.959
Ever.

20:43.959 --> 20:46.000

20:49.083 --> 20:51.041
Jerry, I know it's our first date,

20:51.125 --> 20:53.250
but you don't have to be so nervous.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.750
Oh, no, I'm not nervous.

20:54.834 --> 20:56.917
I'm just a little weirded out
that a bunch of your relatives

20:57.000 --> 20:58.458
had to come on our first date with us.

21:01.709 --> 21:03.083
In my country,

21:03.166 --> 21:05.083
it is part of dating ritual.

21:05.417 --> 21:07.458
Well, I guess it beats
all those other rituals

21:07.542 --> 21:08.583
you made up, right?

21:08.667 --> 21:09.875
They were crazy.

21:09.959 --> 21:11.417
Yes, yes.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.000
Oh, but one of those I did not make up.
