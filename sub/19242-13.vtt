00:54.262 --> 00:55.597
<i>To the future Song Ma-rin.</i>

00:56.556 --> 00:59.893
<i>Right now, from what I've heard,</i>
<i>you are...</i>

01:00.769 --> 01:02.395
<i>regretting your past.</i>

01:03.980 --> 01:06.149
<i>You want me to end my marriage.</i>

01:07.525 --> 01:08.902
In the future...

01:10.403 --> 01:14.407
you told me to go back
and break up with you.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.451
Then make your choice.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.288
Is it a future you can't touch
or the present?

01:21.456 --> 01:22.290
Tell me.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.292
Is it her or me?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.295
Of course, it's you.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.471
<i>How desperate you felt...</i>

01:37.889 --> 01:39.641
<i>How much excitement you felt...</i>

01:40.683 --> 01:43.937
<i>How much joy you felt…</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:47.732
<i>It was the brightest time.</i>

01:49.025 --> 01:51.027
<i>A time filled only with love.</i>

01:52.362 --> 01:54.114
<i>How could you forget all of it?</i>

01:56.991 --> 02:00.453
<i>Even if I only live one day,</i>
<i>I'm happy right now.</i>

02:02.080 --> 02:04.791
<i>So, don't hurt So-joon from the past.</i>

02:05.959 --> 02:07.043
<i>He's my man.</i>

02:08.545 --> 02:11.923
<i>Also, I'll never become like you.</i>

02:13.675 --> 02:16.511
<i>Song Ma-rin living in November of 2016.</i>

02:20.223 --> 02:22.267
Send mail on future date...

02:22.725 --> 02:23.726
Okay.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.228
SEND LATER: NOVEMBER 25, 2017

02:25.937 --> 02:29.149
YOUR EMAIL HAS BEEN SCHEDULED.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.449
You're really quitting the other world?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.869
Do I really have to wear this?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.328
Don't change the subject.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.372
You're really not going?

02:45.999 --> 02:49.127
-You're not going on the subway?
<i>-</i>You told me not to go.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.922
-It's because of me?
-Hey!

02:53.006 --> 02:55.008
I'm getting changed.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.135
What's the big deal?

02:57.343 --> 02:58.803
It's not like I haven't seen it.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.724
It's different when you're undressed
and when you're getting changed.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.475
-Just leave.
-Wait.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.562
You're willing to quit the future for me.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.565
Yet you can't put on couple pajamas
that everyone wears.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.860
I don't like it because everyone does it.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.112
Also, I really hate these things.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.364
Should I put it on for you?

03:18.448 --> 03:20.658
-Here.
-No, take it off for me.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.327
Should I?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.539
Put it on and come out.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.750
Can't I just take it off?

03:29.083 --> 03:30.168
Put it on.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.337
You can take it off later.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.342
Wearing couple-pajamas?
I can't believe this...

03:37.842 --> 03:39.093
My goodness.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.597
I'll wear it just this once.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.687
Wow. You look so cute.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.774
We look so sweet.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.901
Why are you taking pictures of this?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.402
Why not?

03:57.278 --> 03:58.529
These are all memories.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.034
I'm going to take lots of pictures.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.953
I'm going to take lots.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.706
If our relationship happens to get bad,

04:09.249 --> 04:14.587
I'm going to look at these pictures
and say we look so good.

04:15.797 --> 04:16.881
I won't forget, then.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.591
You said you wouldn't worry.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.260
Who says I'm worried?

04:21.177 --> 04:22.470
I'm just irritated by her.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.473
-Do you like insulting yourself?
-She deserves it.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.309
Let's take pretty pictures
just to show her.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.858
Okay, I think we've taken enough pictures.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.402
So, now what?

04:37.902 --> 04:39.904
We have pictures, so that's good enough.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.490
You're supposed to take your pajamas off.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.951
We just put them on.
Why would we take them off?

04:45.034 --> 04:46.119
It's okay.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.829
What are you doing?

04:48.496 --> 04:50.707
It's a bit creepy. Like a pervert.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.376
Today, I'll go for the creepy,
pervert version.

04:53.501 --> 04:54.836
Should we do that?

04:57.046 --> 05:01.884
Will you really be okay even
if you don't go to the other world?

05:03.011 --> 05:06.222
Won't you be a little frustrated
trying to live a normal life?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.850
I'll just live like other people.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.061
I'll work hard and play hard.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.732
I'll think about tomorrow
when tomorrow comes.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.941
That's how I'll live.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.320
You're going to work hard? You?

05:21.446 --> 05:25.450
Yeah. I should work hard. Night and day.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.786
You're a bit racy today.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.289
It's night.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.713
MYREITS

05:38.963 --> 05:41.132
You heard about Director Kim?

05:41.299 --> 05:42.800
Why did he do that?

05:42.884 --> 05:45.178
How much did he take, exactly?

05:45.261 --> 05:46.846
I don't really know.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.973
How could he do that?

05:54.479 --> 05:57.815
Wow! Look at this.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.109
I knew it long ago.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.570
He shouldn't just be released
from his duties.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.697
He should totally be fired and punished.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.740
Good morning.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.785
Chairman, what brings you in
so early today?

06:10.328 --> 06:13.498
Since Director Kim is no longer here,
you will need to step up.

06:13.831 --> 06:18.544
Of course, I should step up when
the company is going through hard times.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.090
Also, let's try our best
to keep the matter as quiet as we can.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.800
Please exercise restraint.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.218
Yes, restraint.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.346
Oh, what brings you in so early?

06:28.888 --> 06:29.847
Hello.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.432
Have a nice day. I'll get going.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.558
Keep up the good work.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.645
You look tired.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.147
I was with the internal audit team
all night.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.775
Did you find anything?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.862
We didn't find anything else.

06:44.946 --> 06:50.159
Kim Yong-jin had lots of management fees.
One hundred million won per year.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.414
I think he has taken
about two billion won so far.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.292
How could he have taken so much
without getting caught?

06:58.459 --> 07:01.671
He took three to five percent
as commission from the expense fee.

07:02.213 --> 07:06.592
We've confirmed a total of seven.
You know that building for Taejung?

07:06.884 --> 07:08.761
He took 30 million per month
from there.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.433
We should have known
when he bought that nice house.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.103
Okay, I got it for now.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.815
Since we're still auditing,
let's see if anything more comes out.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.736
Hey, what are you going to do
about Secretary Hwang?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.656
He came to my place
and asked to transfer departments.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.492
I don't think he was working
with Kim Yong-jin.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.703
He started rumors
that we were dating,

07:33.786 --> 07:35.455
and dug into my background.

07:35.705 --> 07:40.877
When I think about that,
my hand still balls up into a fist.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.296
I know it's hard to forgive him.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.047
Well, there's that.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.176
You need to teach me about work.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.552
Huh?

07:50.803 --> 07:53.473
-I'm not going to the other world anymore.
-Why?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.644
My legs hurt when I take the subway.

08:00.229 --> 08:03.024
Let's work hard today.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.236
DELETE

08:17.538 --> 08:19.540
What kind of work do I do now?

08:23.920 --> 08:27.673
Wow! Is this your office,
Secretary Hwang?

08:28.424 --> 08:30.009
It's nice and big.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.264
Being wait-listed for job placement,

08:35.723 --> 08:38.059
it really requires endurance.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.228
I'm okay.

08:41.103 --> 08:44.857
What did you do wrong, Secretary Hwang?
You just met the wrong boss.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.818
-Thank you.
-No problem.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.197
So, just tell me.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.075
There's more going on
with Director Kim, right?

08:54.367 --> 08:57.954
Something much bigger than Jangho, right?

08:58.746 --> 09:00.248
-Well...
-Yes?

09:00.873 --> 09:01.916
I don't know.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.044
Why are you so loyal?

09:05.127 --> 09:07.463
-Are you a descendant of freedom fighters?
-No.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.800
My family was one of the first
to change their names to Japanese.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.970
So, I don't want that weak blood
passed down onto me--

09:14.053 --> 09:16.806
Yes, you have many burdens too.

09:17.223 --> 09:22.228
But, it will all be revealed
even if you keep your mouth shut.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.690
I don't know what Yong-jin did
with his business card.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.567
Wait until the rumors spread.

09:27.650 --> 09:31.153
All the people that Yong-jin fooled
are going to come running here.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.115
-Oh, then...
-Yes?

09:34.782 --> 09:35.700
I don't know.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.702
I want to be alone.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.704
Hello?

09:39.829 --> 09:42.373
Hello, it's me, Yong-jin. Kim Yong-jin.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.917
I was wondering who it was
from this unknown number.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.545
<i>My phone battery ran out.</i>

09:48.254 --> 09:50.756
If you recall, you asked last time...

09:51.090 --> 09:55.136
if we could have the contract date closed
on an earlier date.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.138
Yeah, did you talk it over?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.307
Yes, I was able to convince them.

10:00.099 --> 10:04.103
Why don't we do this?
We'll close three months earlier.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.605
Thank you.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.065
You're helping me out so much,
Director Kim.

10:08.149 --> 10:11.027
No, I am always indebted to you.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.738
Also, do you have time tonight?

10:14.155 --> 10:18.659
President Choi, if it's okay with you,
let's go night fishing.

10:18.951 --> 10:23.414
Please take me there.
I really liked it there last time.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.750
Yes, it's nice and quiet there.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.752
-Yes, let's go.
-Okay.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.713
Bring the contract when you come.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.006
Okay, see you then.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.008
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.015
Thank you.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.942
You want me to read all of this?

10:53.152 --> 10:57.156
-You're doing this to pick on me, right?
-You said you'll live like everyone else.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.493
The most important thing right now,
I forgot that.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.912
-Move.
-Ouch. That hurt.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.541
This is Director Wang's plans
for the Sammi district.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.584
Look at this first.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.294
Page one.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.758
Those are the basic plans
for the terminals in Sammi district.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.635
And plans
for the surrounding areas.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.889
We've already secured all the forms
and checked them.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.766
You just need to look over them.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.018
-I know that much.
-Do you really know?

11:27.603 --> 11:28.813
What's with that tone?

11:30.940 --> 11:32.024
Are you by chance...

11:33.275 --> 11:36.737
Gosh… are you looking down on me?

11:37.029 --> 11:40.366
Gosh, I'm looking down on you a lot.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.576
Next. Move.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.539
These are the regulations,

11:46.747 --> 11:49.208
our company's
fundamental management plan.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.502
They are put together in one.

11:51.585 --> 11:55.214
What happens if they're put together?
It becomes easier to understand.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.175
Give me something harder to understand,
for an expert.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.762
-I am a CEO.
-I hope our company doesn't disintegrate.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.389
-What did you just say?
-Hey.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.517
I bet you'll be back
on the subway within three days.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.018
Wow, seriously.

12:08.769 --> 12:13.107
Hey, must I show you my true potential?

12:13.524 --> 12:16.068
What is so hard about this? Oops.

12:18.612 --> 12:19.613
This is too easy.

12:35.504 --> 12:36.547
Ki-doong.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.468
I wasn't sleeping.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.435
Oh my.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.696
Ma-rin! I missed you.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.699
<i>Is work going well?</i>

13:04.200 --> 13:06.285
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>subway withdrawal symptoms?</i>

13:06.368 --> 13:07.953
<i>Work is perfect.</i>

13:08.412 --> 13:09.872
<i>But I miss you.</i>

13:10.498 --> 13:11.499
<i>Me too.</i>

13:11.791 --> 13:14.668
<i>I want to see you at work, missing me.</i>

13:15.294 --> 13:17.421
What are you doing
when I'm sitting right here?

13:18.005 --> 13:19.965
Hold on. Let me send this text.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.009
<i>I'm out eating with my mom.</i>

13:23.344 --> 13:25.513
<i>It would be nice if you could come too.</i>

13:31.060 --> 13:32.812
<i>Your husband needs to work.</i>

13:34.021 --> 13:36.649
<i>Also, your mom is scary.</i>

13:47.618 --> 13:48.702
Yes, Mister.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.457
Hey, talk to me too.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.417
Stop doing that.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.963
We should talk, since we're here.
Am I a wall?

14:00.005 --> 14:02.007
This is why he's scared of you.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.176
-Who?
-So-joon.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.887
You didn't explain things to him?

14:07.596 --> 14:08.597
I did.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.433
I told him I lied to you that he cheated.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.855
I heard you rolled around on the ground.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.189
Really?

14:19.149 --> 14:20.276
You did a good job.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.404
Since you hit him, he has really changed.

14:24.697 --> 14:28.909
I'm too ashamed to see So-joon anymore.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.245
I can't even go to the house anymore.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.623
Why would you make up a lie like that?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.667
That's why I'm buying you a steak.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.130
Are you sure he's not cheating?

14:41.338 --> 14:43.090
Of course not. He's not.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.720
You make a joke out of your mom.
You deserve that.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.264
You know how I get about cheating.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.143
Just thinking about your dad
going around doing that...

14:54.560 --> 14:55.394
Oh, my...

14:56.061 --> 14:57.438
Why would you bring that up?

15:00.482 --> 15:04.486
I thought you were in my situation
and my heart just dropped.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.449
I'm sorry. Just stop now.

15:09.158 --> 15:13.370
-We're eating out to feel better.
-I didn't get mad like that for no reason.

15:13.704 --> 15:17.374
I met the wrong husband
and suffered in all kinds of ways.

15:17.499 --> 15:21.128
-I chased the women he cheated with--
-Do you still have feelings for him?

15:22.588 --> 15:25.090
I don't know
why you always bring up the past.

15:25.549 --> 15:28.302
Can't I talk about things like this
with my married daughter?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.679
Why are these things so easy for you
to talk about?

15:31.305 --> 15:33.015
Do you think about who has to listen?

15:35.351 --> 15:37.394
It's because my life was so unfair, okay?

15:37.478 --> 15:39.063
So, forget it.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.440
You say you miss him,
then you resent him.

15:41.899 --> 15:46.445
Every time you bring him up,
I hate my supposed dad even more.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.449
Why do you make me resent him more?

15:50.699 --> 15:53.535
Can't you take it as it is,
and listen to me?

15:54.536 --> 15:56.372
Who am I supposed to talk to?

15:57.581 --> 15:59.500
Fine! You're just so great.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.087
-I've lived a useless life.
-Mom.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.382
Seriously...

16:13.055 --> 16:15.849
You're giving up on the future
and living only in the present?

16:16.725 --> 16:18.477
It makes Ma-rin so nervous.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.896
I'm going to go missing.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.233
Apparently, I never came back
after I went to take the subway.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.734
Yeah, that's right.

16:26.443 --> 16:29.697
You were stuck somewhere
in the future, so...

16:30.114 --> 16:31.198
To tell you the truth,

16:32.157 --> 16:34.076
I did go and look a few times.

16:35.703 --> 16:41.041
On November 30th,
I went to see myself ride the subway.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.212
I followed myself to see
if something happens to me.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.548
I turned around.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.390
So, I went again the next day.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.018
Do you know what I saw?

17:06.692 --> 17:07.860
What did you see?

17:08.402 --> 17:09.653
Me from the past.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.949
So, I couldn't stay and watch.

17:14.825 --> 17:19.121
If I continue to go,
there could be multiples of me there.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.752
I'm going to give up.
It could get really dangerous.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.505
You made the right decision, kid.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.215
Good kid.

17:30.382 --> 17:34.470
Se-young's dad was unavoidable,
and we couldn't do anything.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.306
You don't think it's like that, do you?

17:37.431 --> 17:40.851
Hey, this isn't life or death.

17:41.018 --> 17:45.397
We can change it, okay?
You need to stay put, I'll change it.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.152
You even know the exact time
and date of your death.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.281
I'm just bringing up
what you already know.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.414
Throw this away for me.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.877
I tried to throw it away myself,
but I'm having a hard time.

18:07.586 --> 18:12.508
Oh, you really are serious about this.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.219
Is there anything about me in here?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.222
Why would I write about you?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.099
You punk.

18:21.391 --> 18:25.854
By the way,
what's going on with Kim Yong-jin?

18:26.897 --> 18:28.899
The internal audit team
is investigating him.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.859
He has taken a lot.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.071
I don't think it's the amount
of nine billion won as you thought.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.658
I'm sure it will be revealed soon
if he's done something wrong.

18:38.575 --> 18:39.493
Yeah?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.329
I'll go to the other world
and look into it.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.747
Why bother?

18:44.623 --> 18:47.042
I told you
not to bother with Kim Yong-jin anymore.

18:49.878 --> 18:50.963
It was nine billion...

18:51.046 --> 18:52.798
Give that back. I'll throw it away.

18:53.715 --> 18:58.095
Why? Have you had a change of heart
now that I brought up the future?

18:58.303 --> 18:59.429
I thought about it.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.932
You tried to steal my journal
and throw it out.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.768
I have qualms about giving it to you.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.688
It feels like things
are going according to fate.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.690
Just give it to me. Huh?

19:10.232 --> 19:11.233
What is this?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.318
It's raining today?

19:13.652 --> 19:16.113
You didn't know?
You're already a common person.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.199
Gosh! Share with me, Mister.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.785
Gross. Get away from me.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.121
-Let's stick together.
-Gosh.

19:24.454 --> 19:28.083
Now, you'll have to just get rained on
if it suddenly rains like this.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.920
-I don't think I have to.
-What?

19:32.796 --> 19:35.382
I think I have someone
who'll bring me an umbrella.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.134
Hey, I'm a busy person.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.302
Ma-rin!

19:39.344 --> 19:40.679
Oh, Honey!

19:41.430 --> 19:43.140
-Realtor!
-I'm going to go.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.766
-Say hello.
-I have to go.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.726
Mister!

19:48.979 --> 19:49.855
Who is that?

19:49.938 --> 19:53.108
I told you before.
There's another person besides me.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.234
It's that man.

19:54.568 --> 19:57.738
-But why is he running away?
-He's a little strange like that.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.993
Oh, I brought you an umbrella
because it's raining.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.579
You have such good sense.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.707
Let's go inside. I'll show you my office.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.418
-I can go in?
-Of course.

20:14.421 --> 20:18.634
How did you know it would rain
that you thought to bring an umbrella?

20:19.259 --> 20:21.595
-I'm the best, right?
-You really are.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.805
-I have good sense, right?
-The best!

20:24.973 --> 20:26.266
It's so cold.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.438
It's suddenly pouring rain outside.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.981
-Do you have an umbrella?
-Hey!

20:33.065 --> 20:35.817
My wife came to meet me with an umbrella.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.527
Hello, there.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.364
-There's a sudden rain shower.
-Stop it!

20:40.447 --> 20:41.740
I didn't have an umbrella.

20:41.823 --> 20:45.619
But, my wife came here with an umbrella.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.913
Hello. You don't have umbrellas, right?

20:47.996 --> 20:49.289
-I have one.
-Come on!

20:49.373 --> 20:50.249
Because...

20:50.540 --> 20:51.458
This is my office--

20:51.541 --> 20:53.543
I was dying of embarrassment
because of you.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.796
-What was that?
-Who cares?

20:55.879 --> 20:57.631
I'm showing my lady off.

20:57.839 --> 20:58.882
Your missis?

20:59.549 --> 21:01.718
Hold on. You have water here.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.769
We probably shouldn't do this here.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.230
I fought with my mom.

21:14.898 --> 21:15.899
Why?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.444
Mom brought up my dad.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.030
I said some mean things.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.202
I think I'm a horrible person.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.204
You can make up with her.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.165
Before I got here...

21:33.500 --> 21:37.045
I thought I would make myself
feel better by seeing you.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.048
Now that I've seen you...

21:42.843 --> 21:45.178
"It must have been hard for my mom."

21:45.721 --> 21:47.222
"She must have been lonely."

21:48.890 --> 21:50.892
"She never had anyone to hold her hand."

21:51.560 --> 21:53.145
That's what I keep thinking.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.606
Come on.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.323
Get out.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.164
Do you know what I was just thinking?

22:12.956 --> 22:13.957
What?

22:15.042 --> 22:16.918
Ki-doong just came in, right?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.756
How embarrassing.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.633
But, this is so nice.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.721
Also...

22:29.431 --> 22:33.435
I am so grateful and happy
that you are by my side.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.023
You can't leave me lonely, like my mom.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.903
This is all that I amount to.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.616
Let's not have a daughter.
What if I give birth to one like me?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.370
Just the thought of it
makes me really happy.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.372
A little Flower.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.624
A little... little one?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.377
How cute.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.712
It's hard for you to talk about your dad.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.881
I'm sure your mom understands.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.928
-Right?
-Yes.

23:14.267 --> 23:17.020
I have to go home.
What are they doing in there?

23:18.688 --> 23:21.066
Why are you out here? Just go in.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.196
-What are you doing here?
-Can I go in now?

23:26.321 --> 23:27.948
Yes, I'm going to take Ma-rin home.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.866
No. You have work to do.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.660
-I'll go on my own.
-I'll take you.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.203
I'm going home. Let's go.

23:34.538 --> 23:38.458
That works out. Manager Kang,
take her home safely.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.001
Wife.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.671
Text me if you think
of what you want to eat.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.673
-I'll buy it on my way home.
-Yes, Husband.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.723
I should drop by your house
since we ran into each other.

23:54.766 --> 23:58.270
-Why do you need to come over?
-You have lots of So-joon's belongings.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.689
I can't let him live
in two places forever.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.400
I'll go pack up his things today.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.652
We'll go when he's not working
and pick it up.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.696
Oh, really?

24:07.779 --> 24:11.408
That's the most welcoming news
I've heard. Thank you.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.289
I feel so liberated.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.166
Freedom...

24:19.499 --> 24:20.333
Freedom.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.046
People would think my So-joon
was a big nuisance.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.298
It's okay.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.680
You already watched all these TV dramas
and movies.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.559
If he'd give these to fans,
they'd give him their soul.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.480
It's rare to have a time traveler
as a friend.

24:41.771 --> 24:45.275
Well, I don't mind waiting for movies
or TV dramas.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.487
But as a time traveler,
I am his very best friend...

24:48.570 --> 24:51.865
Couldn't he tell me
the winning lottery numbers just once?

24:51.948 --> 24:53.700
-He never told you?
-No.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.202
-Not even once?
-No.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.412
What did he say to me, again?

24:57.496 --> 25:01.458
He can't change my fate,
and I could get hurt if I know.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.335
He won it three times, though.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.754
I hate hearing about fate.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.839
-Right?
-I really do.

25:08.131 --> 25:12.052
-I'm getting upset just thinking about it.
-Should we have a beer to feel better?

25:15.055 --> 25:15.889
Beer?

25:20.143 --> 25:24.814
He says he's going to change the future
one moment.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.777
Then he says we can't change it.

25:30.737 --> 25:35.158
Just do it if you're going to,
or don't if you're not going to.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.995
He says things aren't good,
but won't tell me how.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.207
-Why?
-That's how I feel.

25:42.290 --> 25:45.168
That's exactly how I feel.
You're just like me.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.048
You know...

25:50.674 --> 25:54.594
Realtor knows the future me
that I don't even know.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.889
That makes me feel so creepy.
I know that feeling.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.767
Words don't adequately explain it.

26:01.059 --> 26:04.437
It's like...
like looking down from up here.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.773
He's looking down on me.

26:06.856 --> 26:08.608
You know what I mean.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.486
There's something else
that makes me upset.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.322
When he goes there,

26:14.406 --> 26:17.367
the phone doesn't work,
and it's so frustrating.

26:17.450 --> 26:20.120
I hate that the most. I hate it so much.

26:20.203 --> 26:24.541
When we were watching the World Cup,
I was so focused on it.

26:24.624 --> 26:27.127
He was like "A goal is going in.
They're going to tie."

26:27.210 --> 26:29.796
Jeez! You know what that's like, right?

26:31.506 --> 26:32.465
No.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.635
I haven't experienced that yet.

26:36.595 --> 26:40.181
Oh right! The World Cup
hasn't happened since we got married.

26:40.682 --> 26:44.561
Oh, you're right.
Then how about audition shows?

26:44.644 --> 26:48.064
Even before the winners were announced,

26:48.148 --> 26:51.401
I already knew that Seo In-guk
and Huh Gak would win.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.031
I haven't experienced that.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.699
What about future electronics?

26:57.782 --> 27:01.244
What good is it
if he buys clothes and bags?

27:01.328 --> 27:04.456
I'm so nervous that I'll lose them
and I can't take them anywhere.

27:04.539 --> 27:06.041
You know what that's like.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.504
I've never received anything.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.718
It doesn't seem hard for you.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.762
-What?
-Look.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.224
The goal goes in like he says.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.226
Seo In-guk wins first place.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.563
It sounds like it would be a lot of fun.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.778
Why didn't he tell me
any of those things?

27:34.986 --> 27:36.613
Why didn't he buy me anything?

27:38.740 --> 27:41.951
He was always telling me
depressing things.

27:42.786 --> 27:46.456
No, you can't sleep yet.
We have lots of beer left.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.167
-You can't get drunk.
-I'm not drunk at all.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.960
You are drunk.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.720
I'm not drunk, right? Can you do that?

28:02.722 --> 28:04.766
Right here, like this.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.811
Here.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.860
I'm going home now. Let's get going.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.354
CCTV
DO YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS FOLDER?

28:51.396 --> 28:54.607
Should I see what Kang Ki-doong
is up to one last time?

29:06.411 --> 29:07.245
What is this?

29:09.122 --> 29:09.956
Wait a minute.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.419
How many cans of beer did they drink?

29:17.505 --> 29:20.675
Why these little... Jeez!

29:20.884 --> 29:22.886
Oh, really?

29:22.969 --> 29:24.262
You're here.

29:25.638 --> 29:26.931
So-joon!

29:28.850 --> 29:29.934
So-joon!

29:30.226 --> 29:32.187
Hug me too. So-joon!

29:32.312 --> 29:33.605
Get off.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.900
Come on! Get off!

29:37.400 --> 29:40.403
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to drink?

29:40.487 --> 29:44.449
-I was only going to drink a little.
-Yeah.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.452
I started talking to my boy-friend
and we really bonded.

29:47.535 --> 29:50.413
-We bonded.
-Stop that "boy-friend" thing.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.541
Why would you give her alcohol?
She can't drink well.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.336
No. Ma-rin is like a monster.

29:56.419 --> 29:57.462
You want to die?

29:57.545 --> 30:00.423
She just drank it to be polite.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.509
-That wasn't it.
-It wasn't?

30:02.592 --> 30:06.012
Anyway. You're drinking
with your friend's wife at your home?

30:06.095 --> 30:08.765
-Do you have anything to say?
-You can drink with Se-young.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.517
Is Se-young your girlfriend?

30:10.600 --> 30:12.060
Stop fighting!

30:13.394 --> 30:15.104
I just need to go home.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.524
Ma-rin, you can't lie down there.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.818
Here we go. Let's get you up.

30:21.736 --> 30:24.072
Let's go sleep at home.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.616
Hey, go get her bag.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.701
Okay, I'll go get it now.

30:29.577 --> 30:32.121
-Did you drink a lot?
-Yeah. I'm sleepy...

30:32.205 --> 30:34.040
-I'm coming.
-Hurry up.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.834
-Here you go.
-You troublemaker.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.419
Stay warm and get home safely.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.713
Kang Ki-doong, I'll see you tomorrow.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.382
What? Are you mad at me?

30:42.465 --> 30:44.551
No, I'm not going to work tomorrow.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.303
Hey! I won't see you. You petty, dirty--

30:47.387 --> 30:48.304
Get lost, you punk!

30:48.721 --> 30:49.931
You petty jerk.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.309
I'm going to date and get married too!

30:53.560 --> 30:57.272
You better congratulate me
with a big amount of cash gift, you jerk!

31:04.737 --> 31:06.030
-There we go.
-No...

31:06.906 --> 31:08.449
You need to take off your coat.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.743
Don't leave.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.625
-Here we go.
-Don't taer it.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.005
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.591
I'll brush my teeth.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.385
Sleep here with me.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.275
Brush my teeth...

31:55.997 --> 31:57.081
Here's the paperwork.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.083
Read this over.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.879
There's no need to read it.
I'm sure you took care of it all.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.673
-I'll rip up the previous contract.
-Rip it.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.055
Right here. Just stamp there.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.432
You even changed the contract details
for me.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.310
I won't forget that you helped me out
with this.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.979
I brought
a really great bottle of alcohol.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.064
Oh my.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.733
-We should drink some.
-You have good sense.

32:31.574 --> 32:33.576
That is some strong alcohol.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.079
I should stop drinking.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.124
Drink some more. I'll drive you home.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.711
We can call a designated driver.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.214
Why would we do that?

32:47.215 --> 32:49.217
I should drive you home, of course.

32:52.971 --> 32:58.518
My job is to get on my knees and bow
in front of money.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.771
Honestly, that is what I do.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.023
What?

33:05.066 --> 33:06.693
I should stop doing this now.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.487
I can't do it anymore.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.323
-President Choi.
-Yeah?

33:12.949 --> 33:15.618
It will take time for people to find out

33:15.702 --> 33:18.663
about the fake bank account and our deal.

33:19.747 --> 33:22.917
I can just take your contract,
President Choi.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.211
That will be okay.

33:26.504 --> 33:29.007
You know that I like you, right?

33:30.216 --> 33:33.052
Of course, I know that.

33:33.636 --> 33:34.721
I'm sorry.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.141
I really am.

33:39.767 --> 33:40.935
But...

33:41.519 --> 33:44.439
I need you to disappear, President Choi.

33:45.148 --> 33:48.067
Then our twisted connection...

33:49.569 --> 33:50.778
will be unknown for now.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.033
I should quietly take care of things
and leave now.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.203
What are you talking about?

34:01.289 --> 34:02.540
President Choi.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.209
I even killed a person.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.299
I can't stop now.

34:11.674 --> 34:13.051
I can't do anything.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.932
I think I'm drunk.

34:21.684 --> 34:22.852
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.814
What are you doing?

34:26.898 --> 34:27.732
I'm sorry.

34:28.441 --> 34:29.650
What are you doing?

34:32.904 --> 34:33.821
Let go!

34:35.573 --> 34:36.741
Die!

35:20.076 --> 35:22.036
Get up. Take care of your hangover.

35:23.579 --> 35:27.083
Wake up, come on!
I need to feed you and go to work.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.334
I don't have time.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.548
Gosh, you smell alcohol.

35:35.967 --> 35:36.968
What are you doing?

35:37.510 --> 35:39.053
You said you're going to feed me.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.681
What did you do to deserve it?
Are you a child?

35:45.059 --> 35:48.729
I'm sorry.
I will try to quit drinking.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.816
Gosh, you're so lovable.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.360
I wish I could hate you, but I can't.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.698
Get up. Come cure your hangover.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.075
This is why I drink.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.708
Oh, my hangover feels better.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.043
This is really good.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.671
Number One Husband.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.341
I don't like it, even if it's Ki-doong.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.177
You better quit drinking.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.556
Are you getting jealous now?

36:24.140 --> 36:25.391
I'm setting boundaries.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.935
There is no alcohol in your life anymore.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.021
Yesterday was the last time.

36:31.647 --> 36:32.648
Okay.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.234
Not a big deal.

36:35.943 --> 36:38.905
You quit the subway,
so I can quit drinking.

36:40.948 --> 36:44.076
Are you really happy I quit the subway?

36:44.869 --> 36:45.745
You mean it?

36:46.162 --> 36:46.996
I mean it.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.919
I want things too.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.088
New things from the future.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.595
I want it like Ki-doong.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.305
Future things...

37:05.681 --> 37:07.683
I'm so envious of him.

37:07.975 --> 37:10.603
I was drunk and talking in my sleep.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.021
I really didn't mean it.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.858
Tell me if you want anything.
I should go when I can.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.945
-I really don't.
-I thought about it,

37:19.445 --> 37:21.781
and I never bought you anything.

37:21.864 --> 37:24.492
I really didn't mean it. I didn't.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.327
Things from the future?

37:27.662 --> 37:29.372
That thing alone gives me a headache.

37:29.956 --> 37:34.293
I really, really, really, really,
really don't want anything.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.212
Don't buy anything.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.424
You were crying an awful lot
for that to be true.

37:41.008 --> 37:44.387
There is a change from my previous plan.

37:44.804 --> 37:47.431
We are not going
into the business of a terminal complex.

37:47.598 --> 37:51.560
I think it might be better to bid
on the land across the terminal complex.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.771
That's too big of a job.

37:54.272 --> 37:58.150
We should invest in a commercial building
in Sungwoo district instead.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.695
How much equity do you need?

38:01.279 --> 38:02.530
What will the return be?

38:03.364 --> 38:04.240
DETENTION

38:05.408 --> 38:10.830
The equity needed is 20 billion
and the return is 50 billion won.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.291
Sungwoo needs equity of 20 biliion,

38:13.374 --> 38:15.668
with a return of 60 billion won.

38:16.043 --> 38:19.755
Director Wang's project
is a landmark of the city.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.008
It's not like commercial property.

38:22.091 --> 38:25.469
Our company has the ability
to push forward with something like this.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.472
That's what I've been saying.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.476
We've been talking about this for so long.

38:32.560 --> 38:36.188
We've had so many meetings,
but it's always the same thing.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.358
Chairman, please make the decision today.

38:39.608 --> 38:42.028
I will trust your feeling on this,
and follow it.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.697
How can we work based on feelings?

38:44.780 --> 38:46.032
This is no joke.

38:47.116 --> 38:50.828
These are projects worth a lot of money.
We need to work very hard.

38:51.245 --> 38:54.498
I understand there's more value
because it's a landmark.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.294
It will yield 10 billion won
less than Sungwoo.

38:59.045 --> 39:02.590
You need to cut financing costs,
or construction costs.

39:03.090 --> 39:05.968
If you can cut the costs of the project,
I will sign it.

39:06.802 --> 39:07.762
That's all for now.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.688
Oh, you were not bad today.
You must've studied a lot.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.358
-This is nothing, really.
-Let me see.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.819
Let me see how hard you studied.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.071
Why are you looking?

39:25.654 --> 39:27.907
Punk, you drew a piglet here.

39:28.282 --> 39:29.700
It's a habit.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.703
I don't feel at ease if I don't draw.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.456
Don't call it a piglet. It's Flower.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.582
Flower?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.002
It's from Flower.

39:42.296 --> 39:43.464
Yeah, Ma-rin.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.049
<i>Did your meeting go well?</i>

39:45.674 --> 39:47.009
You said it was important.

39:48.010 --> 39:51.180
I called because I was worried
that you messed up because of me.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.057
I messed up.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.684
You couldn't finish because of me
and messed up?

39:56.352 --> 39:59.146
Oh no, I'm sorry.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.650
Things are more serious than I imagined.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.152
Tens of billions are on the line.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.532
I think I need to go to the other world
and look at some land.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.701
I'll travel back and forth
for just one week.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.870
I won't go even if you tell me to,
after that.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.040
I can't really say anything to that.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.960
Shouldn't you keep your promise, though?

40:22.253 --> 40:23.671
You were drunk yesterday.

40:26.715 --> 40:29.635
Fine. Be careful when you go.

40:31.303 --> 40:33.264
Do you want me to get you something?

40:34.014 --> 40:36.809
It's only one more week.
This is a rare chance.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.394
Just don't meet that witch.

40:39.145 --> 40:41.939
Promise me you'll only work.
Don't go looking at weird things.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.025
Don't be late. I'm serious.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.028
See you.

40:51.615 --> 40:54.076
I blame alcohol, seriously.

40:54.410 --> 40:57.663
What did I say?
I said I'd bet on it.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.790
Yeah, you made the right decision.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.417
It's been a while, get some info--

41:01.500 --> 41:03.627
You think I'm going to the other world
to work?

41:03.711 --> 41:05.379
You just said you were.

41:05.463 --> 41:09.383
Why did you make my baby cry
and make her want all these things?

41:09.967 --> 41:12.178
When you say "baby",
are you referring to Ma-rin?

41:12.678 --> 41:13.637
Yes.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.766
Isn't Ma-rin a year older than us?

41:19.101 --> 41:21.103
To me, she is a baby.

41:22.188 --> 41:25.566
You punk. You made her cry.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.444
I was planning on staying here
on this land.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.946
You made things tiresome for me.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.581
He's totally crazy.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.294
I'm the one to blame.
I put my husband in fatal danger.

41:45.794 --> 41:47.463
You idiot.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.174
Why did you have to drink?

41:57.598 --> 42:01.560
2018 HIT PRODUCT
LIMEADE

42:03.562 --> 42:04.897
NEW ARRIVAL

42:04.980 --> 42:08.692
OHRI RAMEN

42:22.623 --> 42:23.916
2018 DSLR RELEASED

42:23.999 --> 42:26.001
Excuse me, I'll take that.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.213
Oh, this is turning out great.

42:29.588 --> 42:31.590
It would be great if you had coffee.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.259
Don't you think?

42:34.593 --> 42:36.262
That's good. Put out your hand.

42:37.763 --> 42:39.431
RYU SUN-GWANG
19TH PRESIDENT ELECTED

42:48.774 --> 42:51.235
<i>It seems like a dream.</i>
<i>By the way...</i>

42:51.902 --> 42:54.363
<i>How come you can only travel</i>
<i>two years into the future?</i>

42:54.947 --> 42:58.075
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I guess it's too far to travel further.</i>

43:00.911 --> 43:02.705
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

43:02.788 --> 43:03.914
Manager Shin.

43:04.248 --> 43:05.708
Two movie tickets.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.336
It's a gift from our sponsor,
two movie tickets.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.629
Thank you.

43:10.713 --> 43:12.047
"The Second Love"?

43:31.775 --> 43:32.776
KI-DOONG

43:40.409 --> 43:42.202
Hey. What is it?

43:42.620 --> 43:44.455
<i>Want to see a movie after work?</i>

43:44.538 --> 43:45.497
No.

43:45.998 --> 43:48.125
<i>Why don't you think about it</i>
<i>before you answer?</i>

43:49.627 --> 43:51.253
I'm thinking about it.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.591
I don't want to see it. Bye.

44:00.512 --> 44:01.639
Manager Shin.

44:02.264 --> 44:04.391
Do you want to see a movie together?

44:07.269 --> 44:10.481
-I'm curious about something.
-Yes?

44:11.732 --> 44:13.233
It's about a friend of mine.

44:13.359 --> 44:18.280
How would a man feel about a woman
who was in love with his best friend?

44:18.697 --> 44:20.616
Could he know that and still like her?

44:20.908 --> 44:22.368
It would depend on the person.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.702
Just on average.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.375
-She liked him for a long time?
-Yes.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.918
Is she completely over him?

44:31.335 --> 44:32.920
-Pretty much.
-Did they ever date?

44:33.212 --> 44:34.755
No.

44:37.883 --> 44:40.302
How would you feel about it?

44:40.636 --> 44:44.223
I would feel a bit weird about it.

44:44.306 --> 44:46.684
I think I'd end things
even if I started dating her.

44:47.267 --> 44:48.268
Oh...

44:49.061 --> 44:51.063
It would keep bothering you.

44:51.605 --> 44:52.648
If it were me, yes.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.194
Give these to someone else.

45:04.159 --> 45:05.035
TO FUTURE MA-RIN

45:31.145 --> 45:35.190
Oh, it sure is different
because the cream is from the future.

45:35.774 --> 45:36.734
So good.

45:38.819 --> 45:39.737
What are you doing?

45:40.362 --> 45:43.073
Ah, just putting on the cream.
It's the one you bought.

45:43.699 --> 45:44.533
Here.

45:44.950 --> 45:45.993
What is this?

45:50.873 --> 45:53.083
Wow! Kim Yun-a!

45:54.084 --> 45:55.586
It's Christmas Eve, next year.

45:55.919 --> 45:58.130
It was really hard to get.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.965
Go see it with your mom later.

46:01.216 --> 46:02.384
What will you be doing?

46:03.010 --> 46:04.678
Just in case I'm busy.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.973
Why would you be busy on Christmas Eve?

46:08.348 --> 46:10.642
I'm saying just in case.

46:11.226 --> 46:13.395
What do you mean, just in case?

46:14.188 --> 46:16.648
Isn't there anything to eat at home?
Aren't you hungry?

46:17.816 --> 46:19.067
Should I heat up dumplings?

46:19.359 --> 46:21.737
-Do we have dumplings at home--
-Dumplings!

46:21.820 --> 46:23.405
Oh, they're the best.

46:23.822 --> 46:26.283
There are dumplings
that become a huge hit next winter.

46:26.366 --> 46:28.076
I forgot to buy those for you.

46:28.243 --> 46:30.704
-Should I go right now?
-How can you go now?

46:31.288 --> 46:33.040
Dumplings are just dumplings.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.750
They are totally awesome.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.878
Tomorrow is the last day
I'll take the subway.

46:37.961 --> 46:39.171
I'll go right now.

46:39.755 --> 46:40.631
Is it that good?

46:40.714 --> 46:43.467
Once you try it, you'll be so shocked.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.135
I'll be right back.

46:48.639 --> 46:51.016
It makes me nervous
because he's being so good to me.

46:53.060 --> 46:56.522
Dumplings... Kim Yun-a!

47:00.859 --> 47:02.653
Dumplings.

47:02.861 --> 47:04.571
-Hello, Ma'am.
-Hello.

47:04.655 --> 47:07.741
-Two bags, two servings, please.
-Okay.

48:08.927 --> 48:10.929
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.432
Eating is not the issue right now.

48:13.515 --> 48:16.852
We just saw a legendary performance.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.400
-Give it a rest.
-Yun-a Kim!

48:24.568 --> 48:25.944
She was really great.

48:28.196 --> 48:31.617
Let's eat something good.
I'm treating you to something delicious.

48:31.700 --> 48:33.452
You treated us to Kim Yun-a's gala.

48:34.244 --> 48:36.747
-I think I can just eat this.
-What is that?

48:38.498 --> 48:40.500
I guess So-joon came by again.

48:42.210 --> 48:44.296
Can't you just run and go meet him?

48:45.088 --> 48:46.798
The past So-joon is him, too.

48:49.176 --> 48:52.012
I'll be fine, so you two should go out
and have a date.

48:52.346 --> 48:53.805
It's Christmas Eve.

48:54.806 --> 48:56.725
Is the robot doing that on its own?

48:57.225 --> 48:59.770
It's using that as its eye,
and playing on its own.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.396
So cool.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.483
But, I don't understand the game.
What is this?

49:04.775 --> 49:06.777
Is Alpha Craft winning right now?

49:06.860 --> 49:09.655
What are you talking about?
Yo-hwan is winning.

49:09.738 --> 49:10.697
Oh, really?

49:11.365 --> 49:14.368
-Good game.
-Good game.

49:14.451 --> 49:15.577
Good game.

49:15.661 --> 49:17.621
-Did he win?
-He won.

49:18.288 --> 49:21.917
You're watching a historic match
before anyone else.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.418
-Awesome, right?
-Yeah.

49:23.794 --> 49:25.212
-Awesome.
-Hey.

49:25.295 --> 49:28.382
You can't tell anyone about this.
You'll get in trouble.

49:28.715 --> 49:29.841
Okay, I won't.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.927
These dumplings are really good.

49:40.394 --> 49:43.438
<i>Hello, Song Ma-rin in the future.</i>

49:46.274 --> 49:50.529
<i>So, are you doing okay?</i>

49:53.115 --> 49:54.950
<i>If you are watching this right now</i>

49:55.867 --> 49:58.620
<i>it must mean I'm not by your side.</i>

50:00.122 --> 50:01.456
<i>I hate it.</i>

50:02.874 --> 50:05.585
<i>I'll do my best to prevent anything bad</i>
<i>from happening.</i>

50:06.586 --> 50:09.965
<i>But I might fail to change our future.</i>

50:10.966 --> 50:12.968
<i>This is a little cheesy.</i>

50:13.719 --> 50:15.804
<i>But I wanted to leave you a message</i>
<i>like this.</i>

50:20.350 --> 50:22.144
<i>I thought about it a lot.</i>

50:23.437 --> 50:27.566
I want to be there for you,
who is by my side now.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.736
I want to do my best
each and every day now.

50:32.738 --> 50:36.533
I'm going to do everything
that I can for her.

50:38.827 --> 50:40.078
As for you...

50:44.750 --> 50:45.834
just...

50:49.129 --> 50:51.131
wait until you forget me.

50:53.091 --> 50:54.760
When you can forget about me,

50:57.637 --> 50:58.847
just forget about me.

51:03.810 --> 51:05.187
For marrying me...

51:08.065 --> 51:10.067
and completing me,

51:11.902 --> 51:12.944
thank you.

51:16.364 --> 51:17.741
I love you.

51:19.284 --> 51:20.577
<i>I love you again.</i>

51:23.747 --> 51:24.915
<i>I love you.</i>

51:36.802 --> 51:37.928
<i>Thank you.</i>

51:39.179 --> 51:42.349
You're the first person to treat me
so well.

51:44.810 --> 51:46.895
But, you don't have to be so good to me.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.564
It feels like you're about to leave.

51:51.233 --> 51:53.443
You don't need to try so hard
to be good to me.

51:55.445 --> 51:56.488
Okay.

51:57.656 --> 51:58.573
By the way...

52:00.826 --> 52:02.452
can you get me the lottery numbers?

52:02.536 --> 52:04.704
Gosh, I said I can't.

52:04.788 --> 52:07.207
So-ri's piano school is not making money.

52:07.707 --> 52:09.042
I just can't.

52:09.417 --> 52:12.879
My rule is never to get involved
in other people's lives.

52:13.880 --> 52:14.798
Except for you.

52:17.300 --> 52:18.176
Okay.

52:19.511 --> 52:20.804
Let's watch the news.

52:25.725 --> 52:27.727
Watching news has become so fun
these days.

52:30.147 --> 52:32.816
No, it's not exactly fun.
It feels strange.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.527
I already know
how things will turn out later.

52:36.069 --> 52:38.196
This is right, or wrong.

52:38.697 --> 52:40.615
There is some sort of trouble,
or whatever.

52:41.533 --> 52:44.452
When they're doing this, it feels,
how should I put it...

52:45.537 --> 52:46.997
it all feels a bit silly.

52:48.623 --> 52:49.916
I felt that way too.

52:50.917 --> 52:54.171
The world felt easy,
and everything felt unimportant.

52:55.130 --> 52:56.423
It seemed silly.

52:56.631 --> 53:00.302
<i>Today at 2:00 a.m., there was an accident</i>
<i>on the highway...</i>

53:00.427 --> 53:03.930
Oh no. How terrible.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.892
Be careful when you drive.

53:07.350 --> 53:08.518
How awful.

53:09.394 --> 53:10.228
Yeah.

53:11.188 --> 53:13.815
Oh, I feel so bad for them.

53:24.451 --> 53:25.535
What's wrong?

53:33.084 --> 53:34.336
Are you crying?

53:36.880 --> 53:39.674
I don't know why.
I don't feel good about it.

53:42.761 --> 53:46.473
They must have people
who cared about them, too.

53:48.099 --> 53:52.020
The people left behind must be having
such a hard time.

53:56.691 --> 53:58.693
Why would you cry, though?

54:05.992 --> 54:08.328
Seriously...

54:08.954 --> 54:12.123
You have such a soft heart.

54:13.708 --> 54:14.751
Don't cry.

54:15.168 --> 54:16.753
That's enough. Stop.

54:19.297 --> 54:21.299
I will be loyal to you.

54:21.383 --> 54:26.054
Please tell the chairman
that I am very grateful to him.

54:26.429 --> 54:29.391
Manager Kang,
you are a very decent person.

54:29.474 --> 54:33.228
You will become the foundation
of this company.

54:33.561 --> 54:37.232
I will work proudly
for Myreits and for you, Director Wang.

54:37.315 --> 54:40.527
I promise to be loyal
with both my heart and body.

54:40.694 --> 54:43.738
The two are joined together,
and work well.

54:43.822 --> 54:45.615
I have high expectations. Good luck!

54:45.699 --> 54:48.994
Ouch. I shouldn't have lifted my hand.

54:49.536 --> 54:50.578
Yes, well.

54:51.329 --> 54:54.916
You know I never got along with
Kim Yong-jin, right?

54:55.000 --> 54:55.834
Yes.

54:56.209 --> 54:57.419
However,

54:57.585 --> 55:01.047
I opened up my heart to you because
the chairman requested it.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.883
-You need to know that.
-Yes, sir.

55:04.301 --> 55:07.637
I do admit that you are loyal.

55:07.721 --> 55:08.555
Thank you.

55:08.638 --> 55:11.891
I'm not anything like Yong-jin,
so you don't need to be scared.

55:13.018 --> 55:16.730
But, Kim Yong-jin is done for now.

55:16.813 --> 55:19.065
Why? Did something happen?

55:21.693 --> 55:25.488
Goodness, it served him right.
He was so sneaky.

55:25.697 --> 55:28.283
You told him many times
that Jangho wouldn't work out.

55:28.658 --> 55:30.493
How can a person fall to ruin like this?

55:31.161 --> 55:33.163
The audit team didn't find
anything else?

55:33.496 --> 55:36.583
I don't know if there's nothing more,
or if he just hid it well.

55:36.750 --> 55:40.045
You know the buildings that he managed?

55:40.587 --> 55:42.672
Look into the people
leasing the buildings.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.716
Why don't we look into the management?

55:45.175 --> 55:47.594
Find out if they heard rumors
about selling.

55:47.677 --> 55:49.679
You think he would try
to sell a building?

55:51.681 --> 55:53.266
I really hope he didn't.

55:53.975 --> 55:56.061
I'm sure Gun-sook's overreacting.

55:56.561 --> 55:58.855
Tomorrow, she'll be calling him
"My Yong-jin".

55:59.272 --> 56:00.940
That would be a relief.

56:07.155 --> 56:09.157
I'm getting a divorce.

56:10.241 --> 56:14.371
I really can't live another day with him.

56:14.788 --> 56:17.874
Yesterday, he was screaming by himself
in his study.

56:17.999 --> 56:21.086
I was so scared, I locked my bedroom door.

56:21.711 --> 56:23.713
It's getting worse and worse.

56:24.089 --> 56:25.757
He's out every night.

56:26.591 --> 56:29.511
I know he's my husband,
but he's a total psycho, a mental case.

56:29.803 --> 56:30.637
Psycho!

56:32.305 --> 56:33.848
You're sure he's not cheating?

56:34.766 --> 56:36.059
I don't know yet.

56:37.936 --> 56:40.397
I'm sure he's up to something strange.

56:44.401 --> 56:47.737
It's in the past, but...

56:48.696 --> 56:52.367
I wondered if Realtor was a spy,
or something.

56:52.659 --> 56:54.661
I had some ridiculous suspicions.

56:55.412 --> 56:58.164
You're a newlywed,
and you might just be sensitive.

56:58.998 --> 57:01.626
No. It's nothing like that.

57:02.335 --> 57:04.921
He completely disregards me,

57:05.380 --> 57:08.341
You know that thing
from your work, Happiness?

57:08.758 --> 57:09.717
Yeah.

57:09.843 --> 57:13.972
When I told him I threw away the pen,
he threw such a fit.

57:14.806 --> 57:16.182
There's something there.

57:16.599 --> 57:19.686
I'm sure he's hiding something from me.

57:22.063 --> 57:24.315
Have you looked at the dash camera
in his car?

57:24.983 --> 57:27.735
From what my sisters went through,
that's the direct way.

57:27.944 --> 57:30.864
I already looked. I'm not an amateur.

57:32.449 --> 57:34.284
He had already deleted it all.

57:34.868 --> 57:37.579
I found that weird.
Why would he delete it?

57:37.704 --> 57:39.706
What has he been going around doing?

57:40.623 --> 57:42.709
So, there <i>is</i> something going on.

57:45.003 --> 57:47.505
-Have you checked his GPS?
-GPS?

57:47.839 --> 57:49.883
You'll know where he's been going.

57:51.134 --> 57:52.886
He didn't take his car today.

57:54.471 --> 57:57.015
-Hey, you guys keep watch.
-Okay.

57:58.224 --> 58:01.102
It's daytime, but I'm nervous.

58:01.644 --> 58:03.688
-Yong-jin's not coming, right?
-No.

58:06.274 --> 58:07.984
LOADING
RECENT DESTINATIONS

58:10.278 --> 58:12.489
What is all of this? Hey!

58:13.114 --> 58:14.866
There's too much here.

58:15.658 --> 58:17.994
I think I need a pen and paper to write.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.456
-Take a picture with a phone.
-What?

58:21.706 --> 58:22.707
-Move over.
-Okay.

58:31.257 --> 58:32.759
Hwakyung-dong.

58:33.176 --> 58:34.552
Sangjin-dong.

58:35.136 --> 58:37.597
Those are addresses
of Happiness construction sites.

58:38.014 --> 58:38.890
What?

58:40.016 --> 58:42.268
-Happiness, again?
-Yes.

58:43.895 --> 58:46.022
They are the construction site addresses.

58:47.732 --> 58:49.901
-All right, let's get out.
-Okay.

58:54.447 --> 58:56.282
I'll send the pictures to you.

58:56.491 --> 58:57.492
Okay.

58:59.035 --> 59:01.829
What's with this Happiness?

59:12.966 --> 59:13.925
What?

59:14.509 --> 59:15.593
It's a nice car, right?

59:16.469 --> 59:17.679
Come on in.

59:32.110 --> 59:33.987
Nothing's been confirmed.

59:34.404 --> 59:36.906
Still, please tell me the details.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.909
Is the headquarters being built elsewhere?

59:39.993 --> 59:41.619
Why, and so suddenly?

59:41.703 --> 59:43.955
I don't know the reasons either.

59:45.081 --> 59:48.126
For certain, with Jangho...

59:48.585 --> 59:52.297
there is no progress being made
besides being chosen as a potential site.

59:52.505 --> 59:56.134
Actually, the area next to Jangho,
which is mostly hills...

59:56.509 --> 1:00:00.013
is getting a lot of updates
from the Ministry of Finance.

1:00:00.388 --> 1:00:01.681
I'm going crazy here.

1:00:02.223 --> 1:00:03.600
Jangho is not going to happen?

1:00:03.683 --> 1:00:07.228
I can't tell you any more on that
because it's confidential.

1:00:07.478 --> 1:00:08.479
What? Hey!

1:00:09.063 --> 1:00:13.234
How much money did you take from me?
What did you just say? Confidential?

1:00:13.651 --> 1:00:15.403
You are one funny punk.

1:00:16.195 --> 1:00:17.488
What did you just say?

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:20.283
Hey, just be quiet.

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:24.078
Be quiet, okay?

1:00:24.912 --> 1:00:26.497
You're laughing?

1:00:32.754 --> 1:00:34.047
You're a funny punk.

1:00:36.007 --> 1:00:37.759
Look away and be quiet.

1:00:39.010 --> 1:00:40.595
-Crazy psycho.
-Hey!

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:44.182
-What?
-What? You punk...

1:00:48.269 --> 1:00:49.812
No. Yes.

1:00:51.356 --> 1:00:55.860
What do you mean, fraud?
Why would you say that?

1:00:56.778 --> 1:00:58.446
You know I put my money in this.

1:00:58.529 --> 1:01:01.616
Would I put my money in it
if it were a fraud? I'm not stupid.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:04.202
Why are you being like this?

1:01:06.704 --> 1:01:11.334
Also, I just met the financial officer
from LE Group.

1:01:11.918 --> 1:01:14.128
He is certain they are going to Jangho.

1:01:15.129 --> 1:01:17.799
You are hearing false rumors.

1:01:17.882 --> 1:01:20.927
Don't be like that.
Don't be anxious. Trust me.

1:01:21.177 --> 1:01:24.597
Yes, of course.
No, no. I wasn't getting mad.

1:01:24.681 --> 1:01:28.142
Yes, I'm getting a call.
I'm hanging up now. Bye.

1:01:35.733 --> 1:01:37.151
From what I can tell...

1:01:38.194 --> 1:01:41.447
it is near the city of Jangho.

1:01:42.490 --> 1:01:45.284
Let's go beside it, right here.

1:01:47.912 --> 1:01:48.746
Here?

1:01:48.955 --> 1:01:50.123
Damn it!

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:55.253
<i>I thought it likely</i>
<i>the head office of LE would move.</i>

1:01:55.336 --> 1:01:58.089
"Highly likely" doesn't mean
it's determined.

1:01:58.256 --> 1:02:00.091
You will all thank me later.

1:02:00.633 --> 1:02:02.719
<i>Director Kim and your investors, as well.</i>

1:02:04.178 --> 1:02:05.847
Yu So-joon, what's with you?

1:02:08.099 --> 1:02:12.145
Do you think he's cheating
with an employee at Happiness?

1:02:13.146 --> 1:02:14.939
What's with that pen in the car?

1:02:15.398 --> 1:02:18.025
The construction sites were marked twice
in his GPS record.

1:02:20.194 --> 1:02:22.613
Maybe he was secretly volunteering
or something.

1:02:23.156 --> 1:02:25.158
That's not how it seems.

1:02:28.619 --> 1:02:30.288
What other reason could there be?

1:02:30.997 --> 1:02:34.792
What will Gun-sook do?
I'm worried she might get divorced.

1:02:37.962 --> 1:02:39.714
-Go on without me.
-What?

1:02:41.716 --> 1:02:44.343
Hey, hey! Ma-rin!

1:02:51.601 --> 1:02:55.354
Tell me if you have any requests.
I'll be quitting the subway after today.

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:58.149
Tomorrow, I'll be living a new life.

1:02:59.442 --> 1:03:01.903
First place in the lottery.<i> </i>Second place?

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:03.905
Stock information.

1:03:04.238 --> 1:03:05.114
See you tomorrow.

1:03:09.744 --> 1:03:11.287
Why did you even ask?

1:03:31.557 --> 1:03:35.561
NAMYEONG STATION

1:04:28.656 --> 1:04:29.699
Chairman.

1:04:35.580 --> 1:04:36.789
It's been a long time.

1:04:41.085 --> 1:04:43.087
I don't want to talk to you.

1:05:08.779 --> 1:05:11.073
What is it? What's going on?

1:05:12.366 --> 1:05:14.452
I just remembered something.

1:05:16.537 --> 1:05:19.498
There's a place where they can recover
the record of dash cameras.

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:22.335
Really? Where is it?

1:05:24.170 --> 1:05:25.630
Do you want to leave it with me?

1:05:26.172 --> 1:05:27.506
I know a place.

1:05:30.801 --> 1:05:32.803
Your husband's dashboard camera.

1:05:35.264 --> 1:05:36.432
Leave it with me.

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:40.645
What do you want?

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:09.674
<i>He suddenly vanished into thin air.</i>

1:06:10.091 --> 1:06:12.718
<i>Don't hang around me.</i>

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:16.138
<i>You're acting strange.</i>
<i>It's like you're getting ready to leave.</i>

1:06:16.514 --> 1:06:19.976
<i>You keep traveling back and forth on</i>
<i>the subway to look into Kim Yong-jin.</i>

1:06:20.267 --> 1:06:21.519
<i>That's when you go missing.</i>

1:06:21.602 --> 1:06:24.563
This man is your father, right?

1:06:25.439 --> 1:06:27.191
<i>You touched my dash camera, right?</i>

1:06:27.775 --> 1:06:29.777
<i>Make sure</i>
<i>Ma-rin doesn't get involved.</i>

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:31.445
<i>She's not home right now.</i>
