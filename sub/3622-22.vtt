rock stars to her.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.279
Psst!

10:15.581 --> 10:18.483
I can think of
a certain rocket scientist

10:18.485 --> 10:20.518
who's done some amazing work.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.220
Professor Alanford.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.322
Oh. Yeah... Alanford.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.790
He's a good egg.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.460
Thanks, Dad.

10:32.198 --> 10:35.533
( <i>groaning, bones cracking</i> )

10:36.535 --> 10:38.169
Sorry, honey bunny.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.471
( <i>clapping hands</i> )

10:41.807 --> 10:44.476
Oh... ah!

10:47.680 --> 10:49.180
( <i>gasps</i> )

10:49.182 --> 10:51.783
It's the lab of my dreams!

10:51.785 --> 10:52.817
Ready, honey bunny?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.519
( <i>sheepish laugh</i>)

10:54.521 --> 10:57.622
Is it completely necessary
to call me that?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.658
I like "sugar booger," too.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.292
Honey bunny it is, then.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.628
( <i>frustrated groan</i> )

11:04.697 --> 11:06.931
Ron, we're running out of time.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.566
I hear you, girlfriend.

11:08.568 --> 11:11.703
Look, I'm willing to do
my half of the work,

11:11.705 --> 11:13.638
but you got to step up, too.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.840
Monique, the system
I worked out with Kim

11:15.842 --> 11:17.709
has served me well
over the years.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.412
What system?!
You did nothing!

11:20.414 --> 11:22.247
Got to go with my strengths.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.782
Okay,

11:23.784 --> 11:24.783
you know what?

11:24.785 --> 11:28.253
<i>that's</i> when we get
this party started.

( <i>whirring</i>)

11:37.731 --> 11:41.399
DRAKKEN: At last, a
creature so terrifying,

11:41.401 --> 11:42.867
so fearsome, so...

11:42.869 --> 11:44.469
Aah!

11:44.471 --> 11:47.539
What is <i>that?</i>
<i>( loud panting</i>)

11:47.541 --> 11:50.275
Isn't he just the cutest thing?

11:50.277 --> 11:51.576
Precious.

11:51.578 --> 11:55.447
My mutant army must be
vicious and bloodthirsty.

11:55.449 --> 11:58.416
Cute and cuddly won't
take over the world.

11:58.418 --> 12:02.020
But I'm all about
cute and cuddly.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.622
Have you ever tried
vicious and bloodthirsty?

12:04.624 --> 12:06.758
Hmm... do you think I'd like it?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.359
I know I do.

12:15.367 --> 12:20.271
Oh, sugarfoot...
I don't have any meanie DNA.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.340
But I know where I can get some.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.877
KIM: <i>The Middleton
Institute of Technology.</i>

12:25.879 --> 12:28.546
Justine, I think you're
going to like this.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.583
Look... they're making
their own weather.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.551
Cool, huh?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.657
Pretty cutting edge, huh?

12:39.659 --> 12:42.293
And I care <i>why?</i>

12:42.295 --> 12:44.262
It's closed to all but the most

12:44.264 --> 12:45.663
advanced scientists,

12:45.665 --> 12:47.565
but I've gotten in.

12:47.567 --> 12:51.870
Kim Possible! Welcome.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.305
Professor Allenford,
thank you so much

12:57.511 --> 12:58.977
Oh, don't be silly.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.913
After the way you saved our
satellite from orbit decay,

13:01.915 --> 13:03.515
it's the least I can do.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.283
It was just a little space walk

13:05.285 --> 13:07.986
with a fraying tether line
and a blown oxygen tank.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.687
So not the drama.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.624
Oh, and this is
my partner, Justine.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.625
Justine?

13:13.627 --> 13:16.427
You're Justine Flanner!

13:16.429 --> 13:17.462
You know her?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.530
Miss Flanner,

13:18.532 --> 13:20.498
I keep this here to inspire me.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.401
The breakthroughs you've made
in particle physics...

13:23.403 --> 13:25.637
Eighth grade. Big year.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.805
If you wouldn't mind,

13:26.807 --> 13:28.473
uh, could you
make this out to...

13:28.475 --> 13:29.574
"Otto"?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.743
So, why are we here again,
Possible?

13:31.745 --> 13:33.044
Never mind.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.013
Here you go, Otto.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.381
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:36.383 --> 13:37.982
I have a continuum disrupter
to finish.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.517
Oh, man.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.687
Ted. Otto.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.989
You'll never guess
who's in my lab.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.092
No, no. Bigger... bigger...

Amy, we're here

14:02.776 --> 14:04.342
Right. Nasty, nasty,

Nice job, class.

21:41.267 --> 21:45.269
You worked together to push
the frontiers of science.

21:45.271 --> 21:49.573
Ah, baking soda volcano.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.575
A classic.

21:51.577 --> 21:57.381
But <i>you t</i> expect me
to believe...

21:57.383 --> 22:03.888
that this hunk of junk can tear
the fabric of time and space

22:03.890 --> 22:06.357
just by the flip of a switch?

22:09.561 --> 22:10.895
Come on!

22:10.897 --> 22:12.263
No!
No!

22:13.865 --> 22:15.166
BARKIN:
Possible!

22:15.168 --> 22:17.101
KIM:
Working on it.
