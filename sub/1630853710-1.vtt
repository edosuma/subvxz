WEBVTT

00:27.530 --> 00:28.800
- We have
an active shooter!

00:28.836 --> 00:30.598
We have an active shooter!

00:30.634 --> 00:33.937
- I got one down,
gunshot wound to the leg.

00:38.277 --> 00:39.847
- We have
multiple casualties!

00:39.882 --> 00:41.680
We have gunmen at
the medical check.

00:41.716 --> 00:43.081
Multiple casualties!

00:45.218 --> 00:49.088
- Turning and turning

00:49.124 --> 00:52.387
in the widening gyre.

00:52.422 --> 00:55.657
The falcon cannot
hear the falconer.

00:56.697 --> 00:58.691
Things fall apart.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.099
The center cannot hold.

01:01.134 --> 01:04.804
Mere anarchy is
loosed upon the world.

01:04.839 --> 01:07.537
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed,

01:08.742 --> 01:09.936
and everywhere

01:10.638 --> 01:14.148
the ceremony of
innocence is drowned.

01:14.948 --> 01:18.111
The best lack all conviction,

01:18.147 --> 01:19.854
while the worst

01:19.889 --> 01:22.684
are full of
passionate intensity.

01:24.058 --> 01:26.920
Surely some
revelation is at hand.

01:27.622 --> 01:30.857
Surely the Second
Coming is at hand.

02:07.833 --> 02:08.697
- Report.

02:12.070 --> 02:13.735
- Say the knowledge.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.214
- The merciless Macdonwald.

02:21.448 --> 02:25.615
The multiplying villainies
of nature swarm upon him.

02:27.116 --> 02:28.387
And fortune,

02:31.453 --> 02:34.025
on his damned quarrel smiling

02:34.060 --> 02:36.329
showed like a devil's whore.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.628
But all's too weak

02:40.795 --> 02:43.363
for brave Macbeth,

02:43.399 --> 02:45.470
with his brandished steel,

02:46.701 --> 02:49.606
which smoked with
bloody execution.

02:52.213 --> 02:56.283
He unseamed him from
the nave to the chaps

02:57.548 --> 03:01.486
and fixed his head
upon our battlement.

03:11.296 --> 03:14.228
- Worthy.

03:14.263 --> 03:15.962
- A fresh assault!

03:20.975 --> 03:23.343
I bathe in reeking wounds.

03:27.849 --> 03:29.613
My gashes cry for help.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.289
- Get him surgeons.

03:35.953 --> 03:36.818
- Aye.

04:09.388 --> 04:11.985
- When shall we
three meet again?

04:13.326 --> 04:16.528
In thunder,
lightning or in rain?

04:17.328 --> 04:19.658
When the hurlyburly's done,

04:19.693 --> 04:21.827
when the battle's lost and won,

04:21.863 --> 04:24.569
that will be ere the
set of sun, where?

04:26.337 --> 04:29.406
Fair is foul and foul is fair,

04:29.442 --> 04:32.577
hover through the
fog and filthy air.

04:33.542 --> 04:36.749
Where hast thou been, sister?

04:36.785 --> 04:38.319
Killing swine.

04:39.352 --> 04:41.854
And munched and
munched and munched.

04:42.490 --> 04:46.393
Like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, I'll do.

04:52.568 --> 04:53.931
A wind.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.410
- Ross!

05:05.477 --> 05:07.674
- A haste looks
through his eyes.

05:07.710 --> 05:10.344
It seems to speak
things strange.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.084
- God save the King.

05:12.119 --> 05:13.149
- Whence camest thou?

05:13.185 --> 05:14.421
- A dismal conflict.

05:15.022 --> 05:16.852
The victory fell on us.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.631
- Mmm.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.801
No more the thane of
Cawdor shall deceive.

05:33.206 --> 05:35.403
Go pronounce his present death,

05:35.438 --> 05:37.505
and...

05:37.540 --> 05:40.374
with his title, greet Macbeth.

05:40.410 --> 05:41.375
- I'll see it done.

05:41.411 --> 05:42.812
- What he hath lost,

05:43.479 --> 05:45.650
noble Macbeth hath won.

05:50.318 --> 05:51.392
Boom.

05:56.691 --> 05:58.597
- The second coming.

05:59.430 --> 06:00.964
Hardly are those words out

06:01.600 --> 06:06.506
when a vast image
out of Spiritus Mundi

06:07.174 --> 06:09.509
Somewhere in sands of the desert

06:10.445 --> 06:14.181
a shape with lion body
and the head of a man,

06:14.216 --> 06:17.683
a gaze blank and
pitiless as the sun,

06:18.453 --> 06:22.586
is moving its slow
thighs, while all about it

06:22.621 --> 06:26.024
reel shadows of the
indignant desert birds.

06:27.462 --> 06:29.895
The darkness drops again,

06:29.931 --> 06:31.025
but now I know

06:32.298 --> 06:35.060
that 20 centuries of stony sleep

06:35.095 --> 06:38.098
were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.442
- So foul

06:46.477 --> 06:48.779
and fair a day I have not seen.

06:57.686 --> 06:59.686
- And what rough beast

06:59.721 --> 07:02.460
its hour come round at last,

07:02.495 --> 07:06.060
slouches towards
Bethlehem to be born?

07:08.270 --> 07:11.437
♪ Fair is foul,
and foul is fair ♪

07:11.472 --> 07:15.209
♪ Hover through the

07:42.203 --> 07:45.004
Hail to thee, thane of Glamis.

07:45.039 --> 07:46.601
All hail, Macbeth.

07:46.636 --> 07:50.009
Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor.

07:50.044 --> 07:51.870
All hail, Macbeth.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.746
Thou shalt be king hereafter!

07:58.548 --> 07:59.949
- To me you speak not.

08:00.884 --> 08:02.786
If you can look into
the seeds of time

08:02.822 --> 08:05.757
and say which grains will
grow and which will not,

08:06.423 --> 08:07.792
speak then to me.

08:10.598 --> 08:15.135
- Lesser than
Macbeth, and greater.

08:15.170 --> 08:17.802
Not so happy, yet much happier.

08:22.037 --> 08:25.810
Thou shalt get kings,
though thou be none.

08:27.578 --> 08:30.276
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

08:58.310 --> 08:59.375
- Who's there?

09:01.882 --> 09:04.682
- We are sent to give thee
from our royal master thanks.

09:04.717 --> 09:06.950
- He bade me call
thee thane of Cawdor.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.154
Hail, most worthy thane.

09:10.190 --> 09:11.587
For it is thine.

09:11.622 --> 09:14.826
- What?

09:16.425 --> 09:17.493
What?

09:17.528 --> 09:19.028
Can a devil speak true?

09:21.698 --> 09:23.898
- The thane of Cawdor lives.

09:23.934 --> 09:28.672
Why do you dress me
in borrowed robes?

09:28.708 --> 09:32.408
- He labored in his
country's wrecks.

09:32.443 --> 09:33.880
Treason's capital,

09:34.516 --> 09:37.915
confessed and proved,
have overthrown him.

09:43.654 --> 09:45.219
- I thank you for your pains.

10:57.565 --> 10:59.563
- Have we eaten
on the insane root

10:59.598 --> 11:01.196
that takes the reason prisoner?

11:02.733 --> 11:06.168
- Your children shall be kings.

11:12.313 --> 11:13.439
- You shall be king.

12:08.667 --> 12:11.068
Duncan comes hither tonight.

12:24.715 --> 12:26.314
- And when goes hence?

12:28.654 --> 12:30.318
- Tomorrow, as he purposes.

12:42.934 --> 12:46.235
- O, never shall
sun that morrow see.

12:54.748 --> 12:56.949
Your face, my
thane, is as a book

12:57.883 --> 13:00.150
where men may read
strange matters.

13:03.523 --> 13:05.023
To beguile the time,

13:06.328 --> 13:07.355
look like the time,

13:09.123 --> 13:11.859
bear welcome in your eye,

13:11.894 --> 13:14.362
your hand, your tongue,

13:16.768 --> 13:18.432
look like the innocent flower,

13:20.475 --> 13:23.309
but be the serpent under it.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.956
Yet I do fear thy nature.

13:39.926 --> 13:42.120
It is too full the
milk of human kindness

13:42.156 --> 13:44.227
to catch the nearest way.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.396
Thou wouldst be great.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.166
Art not without ambition,

13:51.201 --> 13:53.566
but without the illness
should attend it.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.544
Hie thee hither,

14:06.986 --> 14:10.419
that I may pour my
spirits in thine ear

14:11.188 --> 14:13.586
and chastise with the
valor of my tongue

14:14.896 --> 14:17.623
all that impedes thee
from the golden round.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.037
The raven, himself,

14:26.406 --> 14:27.435
is hoarse

14:29.206 --> 14:33.138
that croaks the fatal
entrance of Duncan

14:33.173 --> 14:34.541
under my battlements.

14:39.517 --> 14:40.946
Come,

14:40.981 --> 14:42.450
you spirits.

14:43.723 --> 14:46.391
Attend on mortal thoughts,

14:46.427 --> 14:47.961
unsex me here,

14:49.258 --> 14:52.191
and fill me from
the crown to the toe

14:52.226 --> 14:55.529
top-full of direst cruelty.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.467
Make thick my blood.

14:59.236 --> 15:02.435
Stop up the access and
passage to remorse,

15:02.470 --> 15:05.412
that no compunctious
visitings of nature

15:05.447 --> 15:07.407
shake my fell purpose,

15:07.442 --> 15:11.149
nor make peace between
the effect and it.

15:11.184 --> 15:15.785
Come to my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall,

15:15.820 --> 15:17.251
you murdering ministers,

15:17.286 --> 15:19.790
wherever in your
sightless substances

15:19.825 --> 15:22.023
you wait on nature's mischief.

15:22.058 --> 15:25.191
Come, thick night, and pall thee

15:25.226 --> 15:27.196
in the dunnest smoke of hell,

15:27.232 --> 15:31.167
that my keen knife see
not the wound it makes,

15:31.203 --> 15:34.169
nor heaven peep through
the blanket of the dark,

15:34.205 --> 15:39.441
to cry "Hold, hold!"

15:45.446 --> 15:49.055
- If it were done
when 'tis done,

15:49.858 --> 15:52.520
then 'twere well it
were done quickly.

15:55.495 --> 15:56.460
If the...

15:57.197 --> 16:02.398
assassination could trammel
up the consequences,

16:04.300 --> 16:07.704
and catch with his
surcease success

16:07.739 --> 16:09.471
that but this blow

16:12.008 --> 16:13.541
might be the be-all

16:15.517 --> 16:17.149
and the end-all here,

16:18.518 --> 16:19.514
but here,

16:20.316 --> 16:23.254
upon this bank
and shoal of time,

16:25.187 --> 16:26.620
we'll jump the life to come.

16:33.431 --> 16:37.298
But in these cases we
still have judgment here,

16:37.334 --> 16:41.540
that we but teach
bloody instruction,

16:41.576 --> 16:43.307
which being taught,

16:44.041 --> 16:47.443
returns to plague the inventor.

16:53.214 --> 16:55.121
Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

16:56.151 --> 16:59.251
This even-handed justice

16:59.286 --> 17:01.322
commends the ingredients

17:01.357 --> 17:04.827
of our poisoned chalice
to our own lips.

17:12.707 --> 17:15.438
- Is execution done on Cawdor?

17:16.205 --> 17:18.606
- Nothing in his life became him

17:20.109 --> 17:21.345
like the leaving it.

17:26.621 --> 17:27.579
- There's no art to find

17:27.614 --> 17:30.688
the mind's construction
in the face.

17:30.723 --> 17:33.621
He was a gentleman

17:34.390 --> 17:36.855
on whom I built
an absolute trust.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.569
My worthy Cawdor.

18:09.995 --> 18:12.395
- He's here in double trust,

18:12.431 --> 18:16.736
first, as I am his kinsman
and his subject strong,

18:16.771 --> 18:19.568
both against the deed, then,

18:21.135 --> 18:22.606
as his host,

18:23.309 --> 18:25.403
who should against his
murderer shut the door,

18:25.439 --> 18:27.510
not bear the knife myself.

18:42.529 --> 18:43.557
Besides,

18:43.593 --> 18:48.531
this Duncan hath borne
his faculties so meek,

18:49.466 --> 18:52.731
hath been so clear
in his great office,

18:52.766 --> 18:56.704
that his virtues will
plead like angels,

18:57.678 --> 18:58.706
trumpet-tongued,

19:00.474 --> 19:03.414
against the deep damnation

19:04.685 --> 19:06.450
of his taking-off.

19:08.523 --> 19:09.448
And pity,

19:09.483 --> 19:12.658
like a naked new-born babe,

19:12.694 --> 19:15.294
striding the blast,

19:16.698 --> 19:18.357
or heaven's cherubim,

19:19.695 --> 19:22.730
horsed upon the sightless
couriers of the air,

19:23.599 --> 19:28.607
shall blow the horrid deed

19:28.643 --> 19:29.737
in every eye,

19:32.206 --> 19:33.279
that tears

19:35.013 --> 19:36.810
shall drown the wind.

20:25.429 --> 20:27.828
- This castle hath
a pleasant seat.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.197
The air...

20:30.966 --> 20:35.935
freely and nimbly recommends
itself to our gentle senses.

20:38.209 --> 20:40.445
My fair and gentle hostess,

20:42.543 --> 20:44.845
we are your guests tonight.

22:31.121 --> 22:31.985
- Macbeth!

22:42.197 --> 22:43.062
Macbeth!

22:48.335 --> 22:49.409
Macbeth!

22:51.811 --> 22:52.676
Macbe...

22:54.508 --> 22:56.180
Sleep no more.

22:56.215 --> 22:58.378
Macbeth has murdered sleep.

23:01.022 --> 23:03.385
Macbeth has murdered sleep.

23:03.420 --> 23:05.689
Macbeth shall sleep no more!

23:11.758 --> 23:14.159
Macbeth shall sleep no more.

23:16.730 --> 23:20.102
Ah, ah, ah!

23:33.051 --> 23:34.515
Oh, fuck.

24:33.047 --> 24:34.074
- The king's a-bed.

24:34.975 --> 24:37.077
He hath been in
unusual pleasure.

24:37.846 --> 24:40.884
This diamond he greets
your wife withal

24:41.620 --> 24:44.986
by the name of most
kind hostess, and...

25:00.103 --> 25:05.545
- False face must hide what
the false heart doth know.

25:11.981 --> 25:14.345
- I dreamt last night
of the weird sisters.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.117
To you, they have
shown some truth.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.355
- I think not of them.

25:49.384 --> 25:50.249
How now?

25:52.487 --> 25:53.351
What news?

25:56.929 --> 26:00.028
- He has almost supped, why
have you left the chamber?

26:00.794 --> 26:02.162
- Hath he asked for me?

26:04.501 --> 26:05.935
- Know you not he has?

26:09.142 --> 26:12.172
- We will proceed

26:13.676 --> 26:16.113
no further with this business.

26:20.952 --> 26:24.349
- Was the hope drunk wherein
you dressed yourself?

26:26.325 --> 26:27.891
Hath it slept since?

26:29.893 --> 26:33.429
And wakes it now, to
look so green and pale

26:33.465 --> 26:35.195
at what it did so freely?

26:38.605 --> 26:42.202
From this time, such
I account thy love.

26:44.309 --> 26:45.844
Art thou afraid

26:46.613 --> 26:49.577
to be the same in
thine own act and valor

26:49.612 --> 26:51.343
as thou art in desire?

26:54.786 --> 26:57.156
Wouldst thou have that
which thou esteems

26:57.191 --> 26:58.655
to the ornament of life,

26:58.691 --> 27:02.059
and live a coward
in thine own esteem,

27:02.728 --> 27:06.164
letting "I dare not'"
wait upon "I would?"

27:06.199 --> 27:07.865
- Prithee, peace!

27:08.997 --> 27:11.769
I dare do all that
may become a man

27:11.805 --> 27:15.504
who dares do more is none!

27:15.540 --> 27:17.169
- What beast was it, then,

27:17.204 --> 27:20.174
that made you break
this enterprise to me?

27:23.650 --> 27:26.785
When you durst do it,
then you were a man.

27:34.590 --> 27:36.993
I have given suck,

27:37.826 --> 27:40.926
and know how tender it is

27:40.961 --> 27:44.132
to love the babe that milks me.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.406
I would,

27:48.441 --> 27:50.873
while it was smiling in my face,

27:50.909 --> 27:54.004
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums,

27:54.040 --> 27:56.208
and dashed the brains out,

27:56.243 --> 28:00.412
had I so sworn as you
have done to this!

28:21.308 --> 28:23.204
- If we should fail?

28:24.210 --> 28:25.074
- We fail.

28:27.913 --> 28:30.875
But screw your courage
to the sticking-place,

28:30.911 --> 28:32.312
and we'll not fail.

28:35.689 --> 28:38.719
When Duncan is asleep,

28:38.754 --> 28:40.320
his two chamberlains,

28:42.696 --> 28:45.127
will I with wine and
wassail so convince

28:46.263 --> 28:51.232
that memory, the warder of
the brain, shall be a fume,

28:52.439 --> 28:53.806
and when in swinish sleep

28:55.005 --> 28:58.074
their drenched natures
lie as in a death.

28:59.541 --> 29:04.679
What cannot you and I perform
against the unguarded Duncan?

29:21.261 --> 29:24.199
- Is this a dagger
I see before me,

29:26.506 --> 29:29.437
the handle towards my hand?

29:29.472 --> 29:30.370
Come,

29:31.411 --> 29:33.241
let me clutch thee.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.410
I have thee not,

29:38.716 --> 29:40.853
and yet I see thee still.

29:43.356 --> 29:44.384
Art thou not,

29:45.622 --> 29:47.387
fatal vision,

29:49.159 --> 29:53.794
sensible to feeling as
to sight or art thou but

29:53.829 --> 29:57.397
a dagger of the mind,

29:58.635 --> 30:01.399
a false creation,

30:01.434 --> 30:06.879
proceeding from the
heat-oppressed brain?

30:10.381 --> 30:11.378
Oh.

30:13.483 --> 30:14.714
I...

30:14.750 --> 30:16.548
see thee yet,

30:17.850 --> 30:18.924
in form

30:19.886 --> 30:21.025
as palpable

30:22.129 --> 30:22.994
as this

30:24.023 --> 30:25.458
which now I draw.

30:26.828 --> 30:28.395
And on thy blade

30:30.402 --> 30:31.398
and dudgeon

30:33.604 --> 30:35.072
gouts of blood,

30:38.610 --> 30:40.638
which was not so before.

31:18.781 --> 31:19.919
- My husband.

31:28.990 --> 31:30.358
- I have done the deed.

31:31.498 --> 31:34.932
Didst I hear a noise?

31:34.968 --> 31:38.135
- I heard the owl scream
and the crickets cry.

31:38.801 --> 31:39.800
Did not you speak?

31:39.835 --> 31:41.303
- When?
- Now.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.342
- As I descended?

31:45.377 --> 31:46.242
- Aye.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.117
- This is a sorry sight.

31:54.382 --> 31:57.484
- A foolish thought,
to say a sorry sight.

31:58.656 --> 31:59.519
- There's one...

32:02.292 --> 32:05.195
did laugh in his sleep,
and one cried "murder"

32:05.230 --> 32:09.128
that they did wake each
other, I stood and heard them,

32:09.163 --> 32:10.262
but they did say their prayers,

32:10.298 --> 32:12.499
and addressed them
again to sleep.

32:13.233 --> 32:15.073
- There are two lodged together.

32:16.736 --> 32:19.944
- One cried "God bless
us" and the other, "Amen"

32:19.980 --> 32:21.913
as they had seen me with
these hangman's hands.

32:21.949 --> 32:24.177
Listening their fear,
I could not say "Amen,"

32:24.213 --> 32:26.150
when they did say
"God bless us!"

32:26.851 --> 32:28.647
- Consider it not so deeply.

32:31.321 --> 32:35.193
- But wherefore could
not I pronounce "Amen?"

32:35.228 --> 32:39.658
I had most need of blessing,
and "Amen" stuck in my throat!

32:43.537 --> 32:44.501
- Sleep no more.

32:44.537 --> 32:45.404
- Sleep no more.

32:45.439 --> 32:46.465
It's just murder.

32:46.501 --> 32:49.506
Sleep no more.
- Before I heard a voice cry,

32:49.542 --> 32:51.406
"Sleep no more!

32:52.206 --> 32:53.639
"Macbeth does murder sleep."

32:55.011 --> 32:58.143
- Macbeth does murder sleep.

32:58.178 --> 32:59.579
- The innocent sleep.

33:01.314 --> 33:04.122
Sleep that knits up the raveled

33:05.525 --> 33:06.586
sleeve of care.

33:07.859 --> 33:10.491
The death of each day's life,

33:11.459 --> 33:14.792
sore labor's bath
balm of hurt minds,

33:17.363 --> 33:20.171
great nature's second course,

33:21.004 --> 33:23.540
chief nourisher in life's feast.

33:23.576 --> 33:25.141
"Sleep no more,"

33:25.176 --> 33:29.343
steady cries, "Macbeth
hath murdered sleep!

33:29.378 --> 33:33.478
"Sleep no more, Macbeth
hath murdered sleep

33:33.513 --> 33:37.087
"and therefore,
Macbeth shall sleep

33:37.122 --> 33:38.855
"no more!"
- Why did you bring the dagger

33:38.891 --> 33:40.888
from the place?

33:40.923 --> 33:42.622
It must lie there.

33:45.962 --> 33:47.798
Give me the dagger.

34:28.401 --> 34:31.473
- Bring forth men-children only.

34:36.947 --> 34:38.414
- The king was murdered.

34:39.614 --> 34:42.450
Those of his chamber, as
it seemed, had done it.

34:42.486 --> 34:44.887
Their hands and faces
were an badged with blood,

34:44.922 --> 34:46.552
so were their daggers,

34:46.587 --> 34:49.359
which unwiped we found
upon their pillows.

34:51.259 --> 34:54.133
- I do repent me of my fury,

34:55.734 --> 34:56.762
I did kill him.

35:00.135 --> 35:01.503
- Wherefore did you so?

35:05.271 --> 35:06.509
- Here lay Duncan,

35:07.279 --> 35:09.676
his silver skin laced
with his golden blood.

35:10.651 --> 35:11.744
There, the murderers,

35:12.982 --> 35:14.252
who could refrain,

35:15.217 --> 35:16.749
that had a heart to love?

35:19.293 --> 35:22.693
- Let us meet to question
this most bloody piece of work

35:22.729 --> 35:23.723
to know it further.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.661
The great hand of God stand I,

35:29.099 --> 35:30.263
against the undivulged pretense

35:30.298 --> 35:31.398
I fight of treasonous malice.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.870
- Malcolm and
Donalbain, his two sons,

35:33.906 --> 35:36.206
are stolen away and fled,

35:36.241 --> 35:39.871
which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.448
- It seems most like
the sovereignty will

35:47.149 --> 35:48.550
- I am already named

35:50.149 --> 35:51.190
and...

35:53.321 --> 35:55.557
gone to Scone to be invested.

36:04.232 --> 36:06.497
Ride you this afternoon?

36:06.532 --> 36:08.069
- Aye, my good lord.

36:08.104 --> 36:09.538
- Is it far, your ride?

36:09.573 --> 36:12.007
- As far, my lord,
as will fill up the time

36:12.042 --> 36:13.811
'twixt this and supper.

36:13.846 --> 36:16.408
- Fail not our feast.

36:16.443 --> 36:18.915
- My lord, I will not.

36:31.065 --> 36:33.295
- I shall
drain him dry as hay

36:33.330 --> 36:36.263
and sleep shall
neither night nor day.

36:36.298 --> 36:38.364
Hang upon his pent-house lid,

36:38.399 --> 36:40.602
he shall live a man forbid.

36:56.118 --> 36:57.652
Macbeth doth come.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.087
♪ Macbeth ♪

37:00.122 --> 37:02.354
♪ Doth come ♪

37:02.389 --> 37:05.627
♪ Macbeth doth come ♪

37:12.199 --> 37:13.272
- Oooooo.

37:14.038 --> 37:16.273
Whence is that knocking?

37:16.309 --> 37:19.971
How is it with me, that
every noise appalls me?

37:22.178 --> 37:23.843
What hands are these?

37:24.683 --> 37:25.582
Ah!

37:25.618 --> 37:26.312
Ah!

37:26.348 --> 37:28.346
They pluck out mine eyes!

37:30.852 --> 37:36.295
Will all great Neptune's
oceans wash clean these hands?

37:36.629 --> 37:37.287
No!

37:38.057 --> 37:42.359
This, my hand, will rather
the multitudinous seas

37:42.395 --> 37:44.528
in incarnadine,

37:44.564 --> 37:47.064
making the green one red.

37:52.878 --> 37:53.637
Knock, knock.

37:53.673 --> 37:54.572
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

37:54.607 --> 37:56.876
- In the name of Beelzebub.

37:57.917 --> 37:59.779
- Here's a farmer...

37:59.815 --> 38:03.685
that hanged himself on
the expectation of plenty.

38:10.698 --> 38:11.589
Knock, knock.

38:11.625 --> 38:12.996
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

38:13.031 --> 38:14.692
- Here's an equivocator,

38:14.728 --> 38:17.633
that could swear
in both the scales

38:19.070 --> 38:20.768
against either scale.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.870
Who committed treason,

38:25.475 --> 38:28.677
yet could not
equivocate to heaven.

38:42.222 --> 38:43.661
Knock,

38:43.696 --> 38:45.029
knock.

38:45.065 --> 38:47.262
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

38:47.297 --> 38:50.094
- Here's an English tailor.

38:50.129 --> 38:52.002
- Snip, snip, snip, snip.
- Snip, snip, snip, snip.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.398
- Snip, snip, snip, snip.

38:55.505 --> 38:58.905
- Here, you will
roast your goose.

39:01.375 --> 39:02.645
What are you?

39:07.847 --> 39:10.983
But this place is
too cold for hell.

39:35.079 --> 39:36.811
- To be thus...

39:38.411 --> 39:39.517
is nothing.

39:42.021 --> 39:43.114
But to be safely thus.

39:58.838 --> 39:59.702
Our fears

40:00.466 --> 40:01.539
in Banquo

40:02.402 --> 40:04.003
stick deep.

40:06.706 --> 40:08.139
And in his royalty of nature

40:09.909 --> 40:13.045
reigns that which
would be feared.

40:14.251 --> 40:16.217
'Tis much he dares.

40:30.267 --> 40:32.163
There is none but he

40:33.138 --> 40:34.803
whose being I do fear.

40:38.604 --> 40:39.676
And, under him,

40:40.808 --> 40:43.713
my Genius is rebuked,
as, it is said,

40:45.281 --> 40:46.749
Mark Antony's was

40:47.920 --> 40:48.784
by Caesar.

41:30.690 --> 41:32.323
He chid the sisters

41:33.159 --> 41:38.067
when first they put the
name of king upon me,

41:38.102 --> 41:40.070
and bad him

41:40.908 --> 41:41.771
talk to them.

41:47.545 --> 41:52.782
Then prophet-like,

41:53.349 --> 41:54.685
they hailed him.

41:55.386 --> 41:58.557
Father to a line of kings.

41:59.422 --> 42:01.359
Hmm?

42:01.394 --> 42:06.026
And put a barren
scepter in my grip,

42:07.028 --> 42:11.031
thence to be wrenched
with an unlineal hand,

42:11.830 --> 42:13.334
Hmm?

42:13.369 --> 42:14.634
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

42:14.669 --> 42:19.207
No son of mine succeeding...

42:20.573 --> 42:21.877
If it be so,

42:22.579 --> 42:27.115
for Banquo's son

42:27.150 --> 42:28.447
have I

42:28.483 --> 42:29.819
filed my mind.

42:34.257 --> 42:35.253
For them,

42:36.063 --> 42:37.695
the gracious Duncan

42:39.098 --> 42:39.961
have I murdered

42:43.135 --> 42:44.295
only for them

42:45.270 --> 42:46.704
and mine eternal jewel

42:47.467 --> 42:48.332
given

42:50.474 --> 42:52.072
to the common enemy of man!

42:55.610 --> 42:57.409
To make them kings!

42:57.444 --> 42:59.180
The seed

42:59.216 --> 43:01.017
of Banquo

43:01.052 --> 43:02.349
kings!

43:21.134 --> 43:25.069
Was it not yesterday
we spoke together?

43:25.104 --> 43:27.041
- It was, so please
your highness.

43:29.015 --> 43:29.879
- Well then,

43:30.983 --> 43:32.076
now,

43:32.111 --> 43:34.114
Have you considered
of my speeches?

43:36.156 --> 43:38.151
Know that it was he

43:39.121 --> 43:42.659
in the times past which
held you so under fortune,

43:42.695 --> 43:46.223
which you thought had
been our innocent self,

43:46.259 --> 43:49.100
this I made good to you
in our last conference,

43:49.135 --> 43:50.630
"Thus did Banquo."

43:50.666 --> 43:52.198
- You made it known to us.

43:52.965 --> 43:54.869
- I did so, and went further,

43:54.904 --> 43:56.768
which is now our point
of second meeting.

43:56.804 --> 44:01.142
Do you find your patience

44:01.177 --> 44:04.611
so predominant in your nature
that you can let this go?

44:04.646 --> 44:06.810
- We are men, my liege.

44:09.450 --> 44:10.981
- Aye.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.186
In the catalog ye go for men,

44:14.261 --> 44:16.959
as hounds and greyhounds,

44:17.890 --> 44:19.764
mongrels, spaniels,

44:20.430 --> 44:22.060
curs, shoughs,

44:22.095 --> 44:24.835
water-rugs, demi-wolves,
are clept...

44:28.604 --> 44:30.808
By the name of dogs,

44:33.513 --> 44:35.205
I will put that
business in your bosoms,

44:35.240 --> 44:38.642
whose execution
takes your enemy off,

44:39.245 --> 44:42.248
grapples you to the
heart and love...

44:43.451 --> 44:44.415
of me.

45:03.309 --> 45:04.468
- I am one, my liege.

45:05.744 --> 45:07.705
Whom the vile blows and
buffets of the world

45:07.741 --> 45:09.143
have so incensed

45:10.211 --> 45:13.246
that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.

45:15.148 --> 45:17.019
- You know Banquo
was your enemy.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.021
So is he mine.

45:23.363 --> 45:25.723
- We are resolved, my lord.

45:29.734 --> 45:31.495
- Your spirits
shine through you.

45:34.274 --> 45:36.038
Must be done tonight.

45:37.639 --> 45:39.272
Fleance, his son,

45:40.445 --> 45:42.011
must embrace the fate

45:45.713 --> 45:47.445
of that dark hour.

45:53.525 --> 45:55.286
- Weary se'nnights,

45:55.322 --> 45:59.798
nine times nine shall he
dwindle, peak and pine!

46:02.096 --> 46:05.133
Though his bark
shall not be lost,

46:06.197 --> 46:09.500
yet it shall be tempest-tost.

46:14.280 --> 46:15.814
Macbeth doth come.

46:30.758 --> 46:32.428
Macbeth doth come.

46:32.464 --> 46:33.524
- How now, my lord?

46:36.600 --> 46:38.067
Why do you sit alone?

46:41.433 --> 46:45.008
Of sorriest fancies
your companions making,

46:46.339 --> 46:48.173
letting those thoughts
which should indeed

46:48.208 --> 46:50.775
have died with
them they think on?

46:54.651 --> 46:56.514
What's done is done.

47:03.155 --> 47:05.193
- Duncan is in his grave!

47:08.565 --> 47:10.465
He sleeps well!

47:12.365 --> 47:15.470
- Macbeth doth come!
♪ The newborn king ♪

47:15.505 --> 47:16.232

47:23.483 --> 47:26.513
malice domestic, foreign levy!

47:26.548 --> 47:28.012
Nothing

47:28.047 --> 47:29.382
can touch him further!

47:33.557 --> 47:34.519
- Gentle my lord,

47:36.529 --> 47:39.094
sleek o'er your rugged looks.

47:39.129 --> 47:41.926
Be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight.

47:47.908 --> 47:52.207
- Thou knows that Banquo,
and his Fleance, lives.

47:54.175 --> 47:55.710
What's to be done?

47:59.717 --> 48:02.386

48:58.009 --> 49:00.610

49:00.645 --> 49:01.738
- 'Tis Banquo's then.

49:05.078 --> 49:06.446
- Is he dispatched?

49:11.216 --> 49:12.919
- His throat is cut.

49:12.954 --> 49:14.223
- That I did for him.

49:20.762 --> 49:21.626
- Fleance?

49:26.867 --> 49:28.105
- Fleance...

49:28.934 --> 49:30.374
escaped.

50:28.466 --> 50:29.397
Bleed.

50:30.900 --> 50:32.598
Bleed, poor country.

50:34.166 --> 50:35.535
Great tyranny.

50:37.339 --> 50:40.973
I think our country
sinks beneath the yoke.

50:42.878 --> 50:44.241
- Sneakth on me?

50:44.276 --> 50:46.143
- Tis time, tis time.

50:47.415 --> 50:51.148
- Each new day, a gash

50:51.184 --> 50:53.124
opens up her wounds.

50:55.188 --> 50:57.420
A deed without a name.

50:57.455 --> 51:00.760
- Macbeth.

51:00.795 --> 51:01.660
Macbeth.

51:02.896 --> 51:04.098
Macbeth.

51:06.236 --> 51:09.039
- When I shall tread
upon the tyrant's head,

51:09.074 --> 51:10.874
or wear it on my sword,
yet my poor country.

51:10.910 --> 51:13.004
- O Scotland.

51:13.039 --> 51:14.512
O Scotland.

51:37.403 --> 51:38.268
Macbeth.

51:39.438 --> 51:40.468
Macbeth.

51:43.237 --> 51:46.474
Be bloody, bold, and resolute.

51:48.407 --> 51:50.511
Laugh to scorn the power of man,

51:52.348 --> 51:55.648
for none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

52:04.195 --> 52:07.561
- Yet my heart throbs
to know one thing.

52:09.468 --> 52:10.563
Tell me,

52:10.599 --> 52:14.867
shall Banquo's issue ever
reign in this kingdom?

52:14.902 --> 52:15.767
Tell me!

52:19.910 --> 52:22.609
- Seek to know no more.

52:24.376 --> 52:26.616
- I shall be satisfied!

53:33.379 --> 53:34.849
- Tomorrow

53:34.884 --> 53:35.913
and tomorrow

53:36.920 --> 53:38.256
and tomorrow.

53:40.357 --> 53:43.987
Creeps in this petty
pace from day to day

53:46.594 --> 53:49.692
to the last syllable
of recorded time.

53:52.435 --> 53:54.331
- Sit, worthy friends.

53:55.033 --> 53:58.342
My lord is often thus and
hath been from his youth.

54:01.374 --> 54:02.874
The fit is momentary.

54:03.677 --> 54:05.979
Upon a thought, he
will again be well.

54:10.153 --> 54:12.389
Feed, and regard him not.

54:21.232 --> 54:23.398
- And
all our yesterdays

54:23.433 --> 54:28.669
have lighted fools the
way to dusty death.

54:28.937 --> 54:30.305
Out,

54:30.340 --> 54:34.373
out, brief candle.

54:34.408 --> 54:37.007
Life is but a walking shadow,

54:38.410 --> 54:39.647
a poor player

54:40.847 --> 54:45.520
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

54:45.556 --> 54:50.287
and then is heard no more.

54:50.322 --> 54:51.626
It is a tale

54:52.259 --> 54:54.860
told by an idiot,

54:56.429 --> 54:58.501
full of sound and fury,

54:59.837 --> 55:00.701
signifying

55:02.608 --> 55:03.473
nothing.

55:06.238 --> 55:07.611
- See?

55:07.646 --> 55:08.577
There.

55:09.648 --> 55:10.678
Behold!

55:11.477 --> 55:12.781
- What, my good lord?

55:12.816 --> 55:13.681
- Look!

55:15.687 --> 55:17.181
Look!

55:17.217 --> 55:18.686
I saw him!

55:19.890 --> 55:21.625
I saw him!

55:21.661 --> 55:23.420
I saw him!

55:30.662 --> 55:34.266
When the brains were out,

55:34.301 --> 55:35.632
the man would die,

55:35.667 --> 55:37.606
and there an end but now...

55:39.472 --> 55:41.742
oh, they rise again.

55:48.117 --> 55:49.651
- Noble friends.

55:53.487 --> 55:56.227
- I have a strange infirmity,

55:56.262 --> 56:00.697
which is nothing to
those that love me.

56:00.732 --> 56:01.729
Come.

56:03.169 --> 56:05.601
Love and health
to all, fill full.

56:06.233 --> 56:07.097
Fill full!

56:08.267 --> 56:09.466
Drink!

56:09.501 --> 56:11.134
Give me some wine!

56:16.244 --> 56:17.043
Give me some wine?

56:17.079 --> 56:17.882
Fill full.

56:17.917 --> 56:19.477
I drink to the general.

56:19.512 --> 56:23.053
Joy of the whole table,

56:23.088 --> 56:25.086
and to our dear friend, Banquo.

56:27.860 --> 56:29.086
Whom we miss.

56:33.460 --> 56:34.458
Would he were here!

56:35.730 --> 56:39.265
To all, and him, we
thirst, and all to all.

56:40.940 --> 56:42.498
Let the earth hide thee!

56:43.537 --> 56:46.068
Thy bones are marrowless!

56:46.103 --> 56:49.943
Thy blood is cold, thou
hast no speculation

56:50.712 --> 56:54.551
in those eyes which
thou dost glare with!

57:06.196 --> 57:08.226
What man dare, I dare...

57:08.829 --> 57:11.998
Approach her like a
rugged Russian bear,

57:12.033 --> 57:16.667
the armed rhinoceros, or the
Hyrcan tiger, take any shape

57:16.702 --> 57:19.477
but that, and my firm nerves

57:20.346 --> 57:23.380
shall never tremble
or be alive again!

57:23.415 --> 57:26.880
And dare me to the
desert with your sword!

57:37.756 --> 57:40.861
- You have displaced the mirth,

57:42.595 --> 57:44.601
broke the good meeting,

57:46.633 --> 57:49.133
with most admired disorder.

57:52.606 --> 57:54.411
Think of this, good friends,

57:54.446 --> 57:57.273
as but a think of
custom, 'tis no other.

57:58.384 --> 58:01.178
Only it spoils the
pleasure of the time.

58:15.628 --> 58:17.700
- Can such things be,

58:18.833 --> 58:22.601
and overcome us like
a summer's cloud,

58:22.636 --> 58:24.773
without our special wonder?

58:26.078 --> 58:27.743
You make me strange

58:29.040 --> 58:31.613
even to the
disposition that I owe.

58:31.648 --> 58:34.077
When now I think you
can behold such sights

58:34.112 --> 58:36.983
and keep the natural
ruby of your cheeks.

58:40.819 --> 58:43.891
When mine is blanched with fear.

58:49.564 --> 58:50.760
- Speak not.

58:50.796 --> 58:52.562
He grows worse and worse.

58:55.940 --> 58:56.907
At once,

58:56.942 --> 58:57.806
good night.

59:00.143 --> 59:01.473
Go, at once!

59:14.391 --> 59:16.324
- It will have blood, they say.

59:16.359 --> 59:17.621
Blood will have blood.

59:19.363 --> 59:22.094
Stones have been known to move

59:22.968 --> 59:23.832
and trees

59:25.630 --> 59:26.703
to speak.

1:01:12.078 --> 1:01:13.408
- Help, help!

1:01:20.978 --> 1:01:22.450
Was my father a traitor?

1:01:22.485 --> 1:01:24.150
- Your father's dead.

1:01:28.327 --> 1:01:29.793
And what will you do now?

1:01:31.361 --> 1:01:33.126
How will you live?

1:01:36.928 --> 1:01:38.397
- What is a traitor?

1:01:38.432 --> 1:01:39.330
- Why?

1:01:40.306 --> 1:01:42.333
One that swears and lies.

1:01:49.515 --> 1:01:51.749
- And be all
traitors that do so?

1:01:53.315 --> 1:01:54.345
- Aye.

1:01:55.451 --> 1:01:56.347
- He is dead.

1:02:03.092 --> 1:02:05.928
- And must they all be
hanged who swear and lie?

1:02:07.131 --> 1:02:07.996
- All.

1:02:09.068 --> 1:02:12.795
Everyone.

1:02:12.830 --> 1:02:14.304
- Everyone.

1:02:27.586 --> 1:02:29.380
- Who
must hang them?

1:02:30.454 --> 1:02:32.520
- Why, the honest men.

1:03:00.814 --> 1:03:02.446
- His flight was madness

1:03:02.482 --> 1:03:06.450
when our actions do not, our
fears do make us traitors.

1:03:19.767 --> 1:03:21.135
- Came they not by you?

1:03:36.850 --> 1:03:39.184
- To leave his wife,

1:03:39.220 --> 1:03:42.957
to leave his babes, his
mansion and his titles

1:03:42.992 --> 1:03:45.522
in a place from whence
himself does fly?

1:03:48.432 --> 1:03:50.329
He loves us not.

1:03:54.237 --> 1:03:59.204
For the poor wren, the most
diminutive of birds will fight!

1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:02.440
Her young ones in her
nest, against the owl!

1:04:04.178 --> 1:04:08.010
All is the fear and
nothing is the love!

1:04:08.045 --> 1:04:09.117
- What's the boy,

1:04:10.749 --> 1:04:11.614
MacDuff?

1:04:13.459 --> 1:04:15.918
Was he not born of woman?

1:04:31.773 --> 1:04:33.636
Where is your husband?

1:04:37.276 --> 1:04:40.749
- I hope, in no
place so unsanctified

1:04:40.785 --> 1:04:43.514
where such as thou
mayst find him.

1:04:50.562 --> 1:04:52.460
God help thee, poor monkey!

1:04:55.061 --> 1:04:56.859
God help thee, poor monkey!

1:04:56.894 --> 1:04:58.465
Murder!

1:04:58.500 --> 1:04:59.730
Murder!

1:04:59.765 --> 1:05:00.630
Murder!

1:09:03.877 --> 1:09:05.381
- Oh!

1:09:05.417 --> 1:09:06.547
Oh!

1:09:06.583 --> 1:09:07.448
Oh!

1:09:15.519 --> 1:09:17.788
- Bring me no more reports.

1:09:21.259 --> 1:09:22.661
I cannot taint

1:09:23.766 --> 1:09:24.795
with fear.

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:29.167
What's the boy, MacDuff,

1:09:29.203 --> 1:09:33.743
was he not born of woman?

1:09:49.761 --> 1:09:52.124
What's the boy, MacDuff,

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:54.462
was he not born of woman?

1:09:55.932 --> 1:09:57.300
- Look not so pale.

1:09:59.664 --> 1:10:01.497
I tell you yet again,
Banquo's buried,

1:10:01.532 --> 1:10:03.372
he cannot come out on his grave.

1:10:06.944 --> 1:10:09.840
- I cannot taint with fear.

1:10:19.857 --> 1:10:23.219
The spirits that know...

1:10:23.255 --> 1:10:25.856
all mortal...

1:10:26.862 --> 1:10:28.127
consequences

1:10:28.163 --> 1:10:29.860
have pronounced me thus...

1:10:31.162 --> 1:10:32.801
Ha!

1:10:32.837 --> 1:10:34.436
"Fear not, Macbeth.

1:10:35.302 --> 1:10:38.733
"No man that's born of woman

1:10:38.769 --> 1:10:41.872
"shall e'er have
power over thee."

1:10:46.148 --> 1:10:47.878
- The thane of Fife had a wife.

1:10:49.050 --> 1:10:50.287
Where is she now?

1:10:53.987 --> 1:10:55.183
One,

1:10:55.219 --> 1:10:56.156
two,

1:10:56.191 --> 1:10:58.625
why then, 'tis time to do it.

1:11:04.030 --> 1:11:04.965
To bed.

1:11:06.296 --> 1:11:07.370
To bed!

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:10.637
Come.

1:11:11.741 --> 1:11:13.543
Come.

1:11:13.578 --> 1:11:14.874
Come.

1:11:14.909 --> 1:11:15.774
Come.

1:11:16.814 --> 1:11:18.274
Give me your hand.

1:11:34.559 --> 1:11:37.829
- What's done cannot be undone.

1:11:42.136 --> 1:11:43.399
Give me my armor!

1:11:44.809 --> 1:11:46.475
Give me my armor!

1:11:52.214 --> 1:11:54.412
- What's done cannot be undone.

1:11:54.447 --> 1:11:57.379
What's done cannot be undone.

1:12:58.717 --> 1:12:59.713
- Tomorrow

1:13:00.510 --> 1:13:01.748
and tomorrow

1:13:02.512 --> 1:13:03.750
and tomorrow

1:13:04.718 --> 1:13:08.723
creeps in this petty
pace from day to day.

1:13:09.426 --> 1:13:13.494
Till the last syllable
of recorded time,

1:13:13.529 --> 1:13:16.493
and all our yesterdays
have lighted fools

1:13:16.528 --> 1:13:18.999
the way to dusty death.

1:14:12.584 --> 1:14:14.150
- How does my wife?

1:14:16.223 --> 1:14:17.120
- Why, well.

1:14:21.296 --> 1:14:23.159
- And all my children?

1:14:24.869 --> 1:14:26.563
- Well too.

1:14:29.066 --> 1:14:33.136
- The tyrant has not
battered at their peace?

1:14:34.744 --> 1:14:39.114
- No, they were well at
peace the last time I saw.

1:14:40.986 --> 1:14:42.312
- Help!

1:14:42.347 --> 1:14:43.212
Help!

1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:46.985
Help!

1:14:48.993 --> 1:14:50.527
- If it be mine,

1:14:52.261 --> 1:14:53.860
keep it not from me.

1:14:57.563 --> 1:15:00.163
Quickly, let me have it.

1:15:03.041 --> 1:15:04.836
My castle is surprised,

1:15:04.871 --> 1:15:09.843
my wife and babes
savagely slaughtered.

1:15:12.710 --> 1:15:14.650
What, my children too?

1:15:20.719 --> 1:15:24.559
Wife, children, servants, all!

1:15:24.594 --> 1:15:27.755
All that could be found,
my wife killed too!

1:15:29.661 --> 1:15:30.930
He has no children!

1:15:36.335 --> 1:15:37.737
All!

1:15:37.772 --> 1:15:40.107
Did you say, "All,
all, my pretty ones."

1:15:40.143 --> 1:15:41.908
Did you say all?

1:15:44.515 --> 1:15:48.882
- Dispute it like a man.

1:15:51.682 --> 1:15:52.919
Get thee back.

1:15:53.924 --> 1:15:54.921
My soul

1:15:55.989 --> 1:15:59.860
is too much charged with
blood of thine already.

1:16:02.031 --> 1:16:02.929
I bear

1:16:04.167 --> 1:16:05.602
a charmed life,

1:16:09.602 --> 1:16:11.036
which must not yield,

1:16:13.573 --> 1:16:15.678
to one of woman born.

1:16:21.048 --> 1:16:25.281
- MacDuff was from his
mother's womb untimely ripped.

1:18:27.638 --> 1:18:28.672
- Out!

1:18:28.707 --> 1:18:30.643
Out, brief candle!

1:18:30.678 --> 1:18:33.845
Life is but a walking shadow,

1:18:33.881 --> 1:18:37.352
a poor player that
struts and frets

1:18:37.387 --> 1:18:39.415
his hour upon the stage.

1:18:41.586 --> 1:18:42.451
And then

1:18:43.995 --> 1:18:44.860
is heard

1:18:46.624 --> 1:18:47.723
no more.

1:19:27.368 --> 1:19:28.266
It is

1:19:29.337 --> 1:19:30.268
a tale

1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:32.105
told

1:19:33.474 --> 1:19:34.503
by an idiot,

1:19:37.413 --> 1:19:38.507
full of sound

1:19:41.383 --> 1:19:42.280
and fury,

1:19:44.951 --> 1:19:50.189
signifying...

1:19:52.063 --> 1:19:52.928
nothing.
