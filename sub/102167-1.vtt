WEBVTT

00:10.802 --> 00:14.515
They say that the United States
has had its day in the sun,

00:14.598 --> 00:17.017
that our nation has passed its zenith.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.937
They expect you to tell your children

00:20.020 --> 00:25.067
that the American people no longer
have the will to cope with their problems,

00:25.150 --> 00:28.779
that the future will be one of sacrifice
and few opportunities.

00:29.488 --> 00:33.200
My fellow citizens,
I utterly reject that view.

00:35.827 --> 00:40.207
We must go forth from here
united, determined

00:40.290 --> 00:44.503
that what a great general said
a few years ago is true:

00:44.586 --> 00:47.464
"There is no substitute for victory."

00:49.842 --> 00:53.178
Three, two, one...

00:59.685 --> 01:02.396
Further escalating tensions
in the ongoing space race.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.940
Another violation
of the International Space Treaty.

01:05.022 --> 01:07.025
...another Soviet military
satellite yesterday

01:07.109 --> 01:08.277
provoked a strong response...

01:08.360 --> 01:11.697
I will faithfully execute the office
of president of the United States.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.282
...Reagan administration announced

01:13.365 --> 01:15.200
that it was withdrawing
the United States...

01:15.284 --> 01:18.579
The first test-tube baby
was born today in the United Kingdom.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.961
Roman Polanski was arrested at the
Canadian border while trying to escape.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.173
Brezhnev said the decision
not to invade Afghanistan

01:29.256 --> 01:33.594
was part of a broader refocusing
of resources in the ongoing space race.

01:37.472 --> 01:41.185
The meltdown was prevented by
technology first developed for Jamestown.

01:41.268 --> 01:44.980
...nighttime raid by the US
military took the Iranians by surprise.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.482
...leaders of the Polish
Solidarity Trade Union

01:47.566 --> 01:48.859
were arrested in Gdansk today.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.446
President Reagan refusing to
bail out the Chrysler Corporation.

01:52.529 --> 01:56.241
The US hockey team failed to
overcome the heavily favored Soviets.

01:56.325 --> 01:59.661
...surprisingly close race,
President Reagan appears to have won

01:59.745 --> 02:01.455
a second term by defeating Senator...

02:01.538 --> 02:03.665
John Lennon narrowly escaped death

02:03.749 --> 02:05.834
when a would-be assassin's bullet
missed its...

02:05.918 --> 02:09.505
John Paul II was shot
and killed today in Saint Peter's Square.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.844
Leonid Brezhnev,
leader of the Soviet Union, has died.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.847
Yuri Andropov will become
the next premier of the Soviet Union.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.767
...a wedding gift from the queen,
Her Royal Highness,

02:21.850 --> 02:25.062
Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall,
is welcomed by the crowd.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.940
NASA announced that the first
space shuttle will be named Enterprise

02:28.023 --> 02:32.402
in honor of the fictional starship
in the television series, Star Trek.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.074
I believe that our nation
is in great danger,

02:37.157 --> 02:41.161
and that danger grows greater
with each passing day.

02:41.245 --> 02:46.750
Soviet strategic missiles are larger,
more numerous and more powerful

02:46.834 --> 02:48.627
than those of the United States.

02:49.336 --> 02:54.049
If we desire peace, the way
to achieve it is through our strength.

02:54.883 --> 02:58.762
We are today,
the last best hope of man on Earth.

02:58.846 --> 03:02.558
We who have thrown the windows
of our souls open to the sun.

03:03.642 --> 03:07.271
The eyes of all people are upon us
as they look to the heavens,

03:07.354 --> 03:09.565
to the highest hill in the sky,

03:09.648 --> 03:13.944
where we have built a city that will
bring the light of freedom to the world.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.751
Not another party, please.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.254
They already gave me
a birthday party up here last week,

03:32.337 --> 03:34.756
and they're giving me
a surprise going-away party next week.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.383
That's not much of a surprise.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.511
It's tough to keep a secret up here.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.055
Look, Senator Tower is
on the Appropriations Committee.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.140
I know.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.726
And I think this party
was his personal idea.

03:45.809 --> 03:49.062
His chief of staff said
he handwrote the invitation.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.565
Come on,
at least you know it'll have a great bar.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.988
Okay. But tell them it has to be
a welcome home party,

03:58.071 --> 04:00.324
not, I repeat, not a birthday party.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.577
I don't wanna see any more signs
or banners or tiki mugs

04:03.660 --> 04:04.995
with the big 4-0 painted on them.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.705
They did the whole luau thing?

04:06.788 --> 04:07.956
Tradition.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.125
I'm sure I can talk them into it.

04:10.209 --> 04:15.005
I think it's more about celebrating the
new job than your rapidly advancing years.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.175
Thank you for that.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.510
Aren't you gonna suit up?

04:19.593 --> 04:20.928
Cutting it pretty close.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.888
I'm staying inside this time.

04:23.889 --> 04:24.890
Really?

04:24.973 --> 04:28.060
Two weeks of darkness,
and you don't wanna see the sun come up?

04:29.144 --> 04:30.145
I've seen it.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.898
More times than I can remember.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.734
The next base commander
went out with them,

04:35.817 --> 04:39.029
and I wanted him to get a chance to bond
before I hand the keys over next week.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.282
So, while everyone else
is out enjoying the show,

04:42.366 --> 04:46.370
I'll have the whole base
pretty much to myself

04:46.453 --> 04:49.706
for what will probably be
the very last time.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.877
And I intend to enjoy every minute of it.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.212
Then I won't keep you.

04:55.754 --> 04:56.797
Love you.

04:56.880 --> 04:57.881
Love you too.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.309
Ten minutes. Mark.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.521
I have a watch, Wubbo.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.523
I don't need you to be timekeeper

06:37.606 --> 06:40.609
just 'cause you don't have
anything interesting to do.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.028
I have plenty to do.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.907
Currently, I'm maneuvering the rover for
the best position to capture the sunrise.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.450
I swear to God, Wubbo.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.702
You spend more time
looking through that camera

06:50.786 --> 06:53.747
than you do actually looking at the moon.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.417
But I will be shooting
something special today.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.754
No human has ever seen the sunrise

07:00.838 --> 07:05.676
through the glorious twin peaks
of the western rim of Shackleton.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.429
Be sure to tell
all the gals back in Amsterdam

07:09.513 --> 07:14.601
that Apollo 37 named
those glorious twin peaks

07:15.102 --> 07:17.271
Lenny and Squiggy.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.066
I'll not be mentioning that.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.011
This is Jamestown actual.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.680
Okay, people, ten seconds.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.099
Ten seconds... mark.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.059
Enjoy the show, everyone.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.715
Oh, shit!

08:26.798 --> 08:28.383
Yeah, baby.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.764
Awesome.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.077
-Wubbo.
-Yes?

08:55.160 --> 08:59.831
Stop staring at that screen,
turn around and enjoy the view.

09:19.434 --> 09:24.565
Rise up this mornin'
Smiled with the risin' sun

09:25.607 --> 09:29.361
Three little birds
Perched by my doorstep

09:29.987 --> 09:35.158
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true

09:35.784 --> 09:41.290
Sayin', This is my message
To you-oo-oo

09:41.999 --> 09:44.042
-Singin', Don't worry
-Don't worry

09:44.585 --> 09:46.670
About a thing

09:46.753 --> 09:49.464
'Cause every little thing

09:49.548 --> 09:51.508
Is gonna be all right

09:53.302 --> 09:54.970
-Singin', Don't worry
-Don't worry

09:56.263 --> 09:57.764
About a thing

12:56.568 --> 12:57.819
Emma.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.697
Good morning, Ms. Madison.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.533
Morning. Messages?

13:02.616 --> 13:03.825
One from your cousin, Adlai.

13:03.909 --> 13:06.828
Your aunt Hildy got through her surgery
without any complications

13:06.912 --> 13:08.580
and is expected to make a full recovery.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.332
I sent flowers and a note

13:10.415 --> 13:12.793
and arranged a little extra treat
from the hospital kitchen.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.754
Aunt Hildy won't eat anything
without bacon in it.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.840
They're gonna disguise
some turkey bacon for her.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.133
Good luck with that. What else?

13:20.217 --> 13:22.719
Various things. Nothing that can't wait.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.722
Okay, let's go around the world.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.683
Skylab is starting shift two.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.935
Their plan of the day is devoted
to more solar observations

13:30.018 --> 13:32.145
with the Apollo Telescope Mount.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.649
Astronaut Campbell is still
nursing a cold, poor thing.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.068
Be sure she's giving the flight surgeon
hourly updates.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.152
She'll dodge it if we let her.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.738
She is a wily one.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.366
The orbiter, Kon-Tiki,
remains docked at Skylab,

13:44.449 --> 13:48.036
but she's scheduled for reentry
and landing this afternoon in Florida.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.789
Unless you can work your magic.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.333
Pretty sure I can swing that one.

13:53.417 --> 13:56.503
The bigger problem is getting him
to agree to these polar launches.

13:57.588 --> 13:58.797
Did you get--

14:00.048 --> 14:01.091
Great.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.261
-Where is he?
-Deep in the rabbit hole.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.472
DOD COM just completed their ASAT test
over the Pacific missile range.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.642
General Bradford is probably getting
preliminary test results... right now.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.270
Okay. Let's hope this works.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.065
Perfect.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.317
Keep going.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.528
Columbia remains on station
in lunar orbit,

14:21.612 --> 14:23.405
scheduled to return home to Earth
next week

14:23.488 --> 14:25.616
with the Jamestown crew rotating home.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.119
Beagle was scheduled
to roll out to pad 39C today,

14:29.203 --> 14:31.705
but there's a report on some issues
in her main engine turbopumps

14:31.788 --> 14:33.916
which might delay her launch date
by a week or two.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.000
Great.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.836
Discovery, Enterprise and Endeavour
are still in turnaround on the West Coast,

14:37.920 --> 14:41.423
while Atlantis, Victoria and Constitution
are still in OMDP in Palmdale.

14:41.507 --> 14:44.176
What about Pathfinder's
thermal tile inspection report?

14:44.259 --> 14:46.553
We're expecting the official report
by digital mail by end of day,

14:46.637 --> 14:48.972
but the word is
she passed with flying colors.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.980
Jamestown reports
making a new geological claim

14:57.064 --> 15:01.235
on a site 30 kilometers from the base,
labeled "site 357/Bravo."

15:01.693 --> 15:04.905
Early data suggests there could be
significant deposits of lithium.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.240
Wouldn't that be nice.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.533
Have they notified the Soviets?

15:07.616 --> 15:10.410
Yes, ma'am. There's a hard copy
of the official notice in your in-box

15:10.494 --> 15:11.870
and a ghost copy in your d-mail.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.998
Be sure notice of the claim
is transmitted to the State Department

15:15.082 --> 15:16.875
for delivery to the Soviet embassy.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.335
There's a new procedure.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.129
State wants to deliver a formal hard copy
of mining claims

15:21.213 --> 15:22.756
directly to the Soviet ambassador now.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.800
-I'm sure that'll speed things up.
-Yeah.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.053
And as a reminder, the celebration
at Shackleton tomorrow morning, our time,

15:28.136 --> 15:29.513
in case you want to watch the festivities.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.306
-Has it really been two weeks?
-Yes, ma'am.

15:31.390 --> 15:34.476
-They're pretty excited up there.
-Always are. Wish me luck.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.483
-Morning.
-Morning.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.903
I can get you a better printer.

15:45.571 --> 15:48.282
Yeah, can you get the Pentagon
to approve it in less than a year?

15:48.365 --> 15:50.617
No, but I can have a new one
installed this afternoon.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.160
Brand-new, like, still in the box.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.539
Must be nice
to have your own revenue stream.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.916
Well, capitalism, it works.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.085
How'd the test go?

16:02.004 --> 16:05.340
Thirty pages of data,
all to say we missed.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.969
It's bad luck.
But the day does have its bright points.

16:16.727 --> 16:20.147
Army-Air Force tickets
at the 50-yard line.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.107
What'd you do,
get Emma to rob the White House?

16:22.191 --> 16:24.610
She's an old second-story gal
from way back.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.528
Wow. Thanks. Really.

16:28.697 --> 16:29.865
What's it gonna cost me?

16:30.449 --> 16:31.450
They're a gift.

16:33.202 --> 16:36.747
But if you wanted to make Emma feel
like her efforts were appreciated,

16:36.830 --> 16:40.042
you might consider allowing the Kon-Tiki
to land at Edwards tonight.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.671
And maybe also free up some space for a
couple of polar launches from Vandenberg.

16:45.881 --> 16:49.259
Well, I can clear the Kon-Tiki
to land at Edwards,

16:49.343 --> 16:51.220
but you know the Pentagon
really doesn't like

16:51.303 --> 16:53.388
having unsecured vehicles
and crews at Vandenberg.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.599
Come on, Nelson.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.935
I've got orbiters
double-parked at Edwards,

16:58.018 --> 16:59.770
and you've got three open launch windows

16:59.853 --> 17:02.105
before the next military shuttle's
even scheduled.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.191
Come on.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.401
I'll tell the crews to wear blindfolds

17:06.484 --> 17:08.487
so they don't see anything
they're not supposed to.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.406
I'm sorry.

17:12.491 --> 17:16.286
I wish I could, but everyone's still
on edge after what happened in Berlin.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.288
Berlin was almost a year ago.

17:18.372 --> 17:22.709
It hasn't gotten any better, and in
some ways it's gotten worse. So, sorry.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.752
Okay.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.922
-It was worth a try.
-Yeah. There you go.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.341
No. They're a gift.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.594
I hear the Falcons might be
headed to a bowl game this year.

17:32.678 --> 17:34.805
From your lips to God's ears.

17:35.639 --> 17:36.807
And, hey...

17:38.100 --> 17:39.101
I owe you one.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.019
You certainly do.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.315
Okay, keep going.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.651
-What else?
-Yes, ma'am.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.487
The profit and loss statement
for the last quarter is on your desk,

17:50.571 --> 17:52.781
along with projections
on the new licensing revenue

17:52.865 --> 17:55.117
from the microgravity
silicon growth patents.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.536
And I got a d-mail from
Administrator Paine's office

17:57.619 --> 18:00.581
asking if you and the general
are available for dinner tonight.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.249
Dinner? What's he up to?

18:02.332 --> 18:04.626
I think he's gonna press you
on that Pathfinder thing again.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.461
He's relentless.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.923
Where? Please not Mama's Porch.

18:10.007 --> 18:12.092
Afraid so.
He's got a thing about that chili.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.136
My hair's gonna
smell like chili for a week.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.804
-Good morning, Ms. Madison.
-Morning, ma'am.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.181
Gary. Helena.

18:18.724 --> 18:21.059
-God, she hates me.
-You think everyone hates you.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.270
Not everyone. Just management.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.314
If that were true,
you wouldn't be in the program.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.815
Sometimes the system screws up.

18:26.899 --> 18:29.151
Sounds like garden-variety paranoia to me.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.445
I just know when people are out to get me.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.155
That changes today, right?

18:34.573 --> 18:35.741
Right.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.160
I can't hear you, Captain.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.244
Right.

18:39.328 --> 18:43.707
Today you are not just
a miserable Air Force bus driver

18:43.790 --> 18:47.711
dreaming of flying in space like
the marine aviators you secretly worship.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.131
Today you will achieve your goal.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.300
And you will not take no for an answer.

18:54.259 --> 18:55.802
Well, he never says no.

18:55.886 --> 18:59.348
He just leans in real close and says,
"I'll let you know when you're ready."

19:00.140 --> 19:04.895
The admiral is a tough old squid,
and he'll be impressed by your courage.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.773
They say he hates redheads.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.609
-Yeah, that's just a rumor.
-The rumors are always true.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.112
Go in there and get your ticket punched.

19:14.947 --> 19:19.409
Or you can keep riding backup and water
my plants when I'm on Skylab next month.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.914
He's not that bad, Gary. Really.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.751
He freaks me out.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.048
Go.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.223
Come.

19:44.101 --> 19:46.520
Hey, Chief. You got a minute?

19:47.271 --> 19:50.274
Can't you see I'm on the green
at the ninth hole at Pebble Beach?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.401
Oh, right.

19:53.610 --> 19:57.239
-Okay, I can come back in a little bit.
-I'm on the carpet in my office.

20:00.993 --> 20:04.246
Right. Right.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.206
What can I do for you, Mr. Piscotty?

20:06.665 --> 20:08.125
Well, sir...

20:09.126 --> 20:13.422
I wanted to talk to you about my...
my career.

20:15.299 --> 20:18.385
Your career? That's a mighty big subject
for a Thursday morning.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.553
Yes, sir.

20:20.888 --> 20:23.891
I mean, not my whole career.
I was hoping to discuss with you--

20:23.974 --> 20:25.934
Yeah, yeah, you want a prime crew slot.

20:26.810 --> 20:27.895
Yes, sir...

20:29.021 --> 20:30.022
on Pathfinder.

20:30.105 --> 20:32.024
On Pathfinder?

20:33.901 --> 20:36.361
Wow. That's ambitious.

20:36.445 --> 20:37.946
You think you're ready to be prime crew

20:38.030 --> 20:40.157
on the maiden voyage
of America's next-generation shuttle?

20:40.782 --> 20:41.783
Yes, sir.

20:41.867 --> 20:44.745
The vehicle that will redefine
space travel as we know it

20:44.828 --> 20:47.080
and propel this country to Mars
and beyond?

20:47.164 --> 20:48.165
Yes, sir.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.002
I like ambition in a pilot.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.381
You're gonna be one hell of an astronaut.

20:57.466 --> 20:58.509
Thank you, sir.

20:59.927 --> 21:01.970
I'll let you know when you're ready.

21:15.234 --> 21:17.736
I've been here three years now, sir.

21:17.819 --> 21:21.031
Qualified as orbiter pilot, LSAM pilot,

21:21.114 --> 21:23.909
lunar prospector, robotic arms specialist,
and astro-astronomer.

21:23.992 --> 21:27.120
Been CAPCOM on five shuttle moon flights
and two orbital repairs.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.455
Been backup on six crew.

21:29.039 --> 21:31.834
And my performance evaluation
is consistently in the 95th percentile.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.877
I've done everything
this program has asked of me.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.504
And so far, the closest I've been to space

21:35.587 --> 21:38.006
is standing on top of the gantry
on pad 39A.

21:38.632 --> 21:39.925
Why can't I get a flight?

21:40.509 --> 21:42.719
I don't like redheads.
Everyone knows that.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.436
When do I get my shot?

21:52.855 --> 21:57.693
Just trust me when I tell you
that when you're ready...

21:59.736 --> 22:00.779
I'll let you know.

22:01.488 --> 22:08.287
Now, I think it'd be a great idea
for you to take your foot off my ball.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.332
Thank you.

22:16.211 --> 22:20.257
You can close the door behind ya.

22:41.904 --> 22:46.200
With the development of new and
exciting technologies like solar panels,

22:46.283 --> 22:48.577
NASA's making real contributions
back here on Earth.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.163
Even now, new electric vehicles

22:51.246 --> 22:54.875
made possible by batteries
originally designed for the lunar rover

22:54.958 --> 22:58.337
are beginning to hit the road
not only on the moon,

22:58.420 --> 23:00.631
but right here in the good old US of A.

23:09.139 --> 23:11.642
And with that,
I'll be happy to answer your questions.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.311
Yes, sir?

23:15.521 --> 23:17.856
How y'all go to the bathroom in space?

23:20.234 --> 23:22.486
Let me tell you, without gravity,

23:22.569 --> 23:26.406
they gotta use air suction to make sure
things go in the right direction.

23:26.490 --> 23:31.328
So you could say when you take a crap
in space, the shit really hits the fan.

23:36.625 --> 23:37.626
Yes.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.128
I'm sure you get this all the time,

23:40.212 --> 23:44.508
but would you mind telling us the story
of how you saved that poor girl

23:44.591 --> 23:46.385
who broke her arm on the moon?

23:56.103 --> 23:59.815
It had been a rough week
on the old Jamestown base.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.608
And it was different in those days.

24:02.484 --> 24:05.153
The base was just a single room.

24:05.237 --> 24:08.031
Barely enough space for three people
to live and work together.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.200
Not like the palace they got up there now.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.829
No, it was the pioneer days.

24:13.912 --> 24:16.790
We were the settlers,
and the Russians, they were the Indians.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.127
It wasn't an easy place to live,

24:20.711 --> 24:22.379
and a lot of things went wrong.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.423
Was a lot of turmoil.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.801
And sometimes the--

24:29.553 --> 24:31.889
sometimes the best of plans
falls apart on ya.

24:33.140 --> 24:34.766
Best equipment fails.

24:37.895 --> 24:39.146
Even the best people.

24:39.938 --> 24:42.983
Sometimes it all just falls apart on ya.

25:03.378 --> 25:04.379
Anyway...

25:05.756 --> 25:07.132
it was the middle of the night.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.551
I rolled out of my rack
before I was even awake.

25:12.471 --> 25:13.555
Come.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.850
Hey, Ed. You got a minute?

25:18.685 --> 25:21.855
Spaghetti night. I know.
How about I walk you to your car?

25:21.939 --> 25:23.565
Then I'm all ears.

25:25.025 --> 25:28.445
Look, the president has some concerns
about Pathfinder.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.950
Look, you don't need my approval.

25:33.450 --> 25:36.578
Payload's outside my lane
unless it affects crew or crew selection.

25:36.662 --> 25:39.790
I know, but the White House wants this
to be a unanimous decision

25:39.873 --> 25:41.083
on the part of NASA.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.627
You mean they don't want the press to say

25:43.710 --> 25:45.712
that they decided
to do a little saber-rattling

25:45.796 --> 25:47.714
over the objections of the experts at JSC.

25:47.798 --> 25:51.093
Come on, Ed, work with me here.
We're gonna arm it eventually.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.804
Why not test that capability
on the first flight?

25:53.887 --> 25:57.432
We need to send a message to the Soviets.
They're about to test their own shuttle.

25:57.516 --> 26:00.102
But we're already testing
our second-generation shuttle.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.855
Margo's just protecting her turf.

26:03.355 --> 26:05.816
She's worried that the second
we put weapons on Pathfinder

26:05.899 --> 26:08.735
that it'll become a military asset
and outside her jurisdiction.

26:08.819 --> 26:09.862
She's not wrong.

26:09.945 --> 26:12.739
I go to the Pentagon
a lot more than I'd like to these days,

26:12.823 --> 26:15.033
and I guarantee you,
the Joint Chiefs up there,

26:15.117 --> 26:18.662
they would love to add Pathfinder
to their little fleet out at Vandenberg.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.497
Even if that were true,

26:20.581 --> 26:24.501
there will be plenty of new shuttles
for everyone... eventually.

26:24.585 --> 26:27.796
Look, I'm having dinner with Margo
and the general tonight.

26:29.006 --> 26:32.467
If I can turn Margo around to support
putting ordnance on Pathfinder,

26:32.551 --> 26:33.677
are you in?

26:34.136 --> 26:36.930
Look, if you can turn Margo Madison around
over a bowl of chili,

26:37.014 --> 26:39.433
then who am I to stand in your way?

26:42.978 --> 26:44.021
Is that your car?

26:44.438 --> 26:45.689
You like it?

26:46.815 --> 26:48.483
No more gas stations.

26:48.567 --> 26:50.986
Just plug it in
and get 60 miles on a single charge.

26:51.737 --> 26:54.948
-Well, you do love your toys.
-It's not a toy.

26:55.032 --> 26:56.116
It's the future.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.118
Yeah, well, how fast does it go?

26:58.202 --> 26:59.828
Fast enough. Sixty-five.

26:59.912 --> 27:01.038
That's a toy.

27:02.039 --> 27:03.207
Speed limit's 55.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.792
For some people.

28:04.685 --> 28:06.687
-...twenty-five, twenty-six--
-Hey, babe.

28:06.770 --> 28:08.021
Hi, sweetie.

28:08.897 --> 28:10.941
-So, guess what.
-What?

28:11.441 --> 28:14.111
With the money I made
from last month's receipts

28:14.194 --> 28:18.031
plus the dividends from the LPH Investment
Fund you didn't want me to invest in...

28:18.115 --> 28:20.117
Keep beating that dead horse.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.579
I'm gonna be able to pay off the second
mortgage on the house next month.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.790
-Full year ahead of schedule.
-Wow.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.126
Hell of a job, honey.

28:30.002 --> 28:31.503
Congratulations.

28:31.587 --> 28:32.921
Thank you. I deserve it.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.590
Yes, you do.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.800
Deserve every bit of it.

28:38.844 --> 28:41.471
I gotta admit, I was skeptical.

28:41.555 --> 28:44.141
I know. Trust me, I'll remind you
of that for the rest of your life.

28:44.224 --> 28:45.559
Of that, I'm sure.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.394
-Make a hole.
-Sorry.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.397
Great. Let's just...

28:50.480 --> 28:52.524
-Thank you.
-I've been thinking about this all day.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.778
All right. Let's see.

28:58.447 --> 29:00.282
Bobby put too much oregano in that.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.451
He thinks he's improving it.

29:02.534 --> 29:04.203
Better not be improving the garlic bread.
Tell ya that.

29:08.665 --> 29:10.167
Where's the cheese?

29:10.834 --> 29:11.835
Right here.

29:11.919 --> 29:13.337
No, the cheese.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.380
You know what he wants.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.759
Come on, Dad. This is real Parmesan,

29:18.842 --> 29:22.054
not those plastic shavings
in the green container you call cheese.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.056
It's good enough for the customers.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.225
Not anymore.
Now it's fresh-grated every day.

29:26.308 --> 29:28.143
I gotta use a spoon?

29:29.394 --> 29:31.021
I can't even shake it over the spaghetti?

29:31.104 --> 29:33.315
I know, it's pretty tough.
You want me to show you how?

29:33.899 --> 29:34.983
Just--

29:37.653 --> 29:39.780
-Mom, can you pass the bread?
-Sure.

29:41.281 --> 29:43.408
Hey, did you get a chance
to look at those college catalogs?

29:43.492 --> 29:45.953
She means did you get a chance
to look at the new catalog

29:46.036 --> 29:48.497
from William & Mary
with that big pond on the cover.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.333
Not a pond, it is a lake. Lake Matoaka.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.710
And it was created by the colonists
in the 18th century,

29:53.794 --> 29:56.588
and it's one of the most beautiful places
on the East Coast.

29:56.672 --> 29:57.965
So fancy.

29:58.799 --> 30:00.843
No, not yet, but I will.

30:01.468 --> 30:04.054
Well, don't worry about it. No pressure.

30:04.137 --> 30:07.015
Wherever you choose to go
is completely your decision.

30:14.356 --> 30:17.985
William & Mary has one of the best
English programs in the entire country,

30:18.068 --> 30:19.903
not to mention,
a wonderful theater program.

30:19.987 --> 30:22.322
Wait, theater? You're talking about
studying theater now?

30:22.406 --> 30:25.826
I don't know. Maybe.
It was just a random thought.

30:25.909 --> 30:27.119
No, no.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.705
Engineering, physics, computer science.
That's the future.

30:29.788 --> 30:32.082
You got good enough grades to write
your own ticket to wherever you wanna go.

30:32.165 --> 30:35.210
But we're not gonna push any particular
course of study or college, are we, Dad?

30:35.294 --> 30:37.171
No, we're not. We're absolutely not.

30:38.714 --> 30:40.174
Could you pass me the salt?

30:40.799 --> 30:43.719
I think it's over there
by that William & Mary alumni mug.

30:46.972 --> 30:48.765
You should pursue anything that you want.

30:48.849 --> 30:50.601
All right, you find your passion.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.187
Yeah. Find the real cheese
while you're at it.

30:53.270 --> 30:55.731
-Ed.
-Dad, you're such an old man sometimes.

30:55.814 --> 30:57.566
-Come on.
-Look. It doesn't melt right. Look.

30:57.649 --> 30:58.650
Just mix it in. It will.

30:58.734 --> 30:59.902
-Try it. It's delicious.
-It's crumb--

31:11.580 --> 31:13.373
All right, we have returned.

31:16.168 --> 31:18.712
Hey, I think she's on next.
Hit the light. Turn it up.

31:21.298 --> 31:23.675
Sure. Okay.

31:23.759 --> 31:26.762
You know, the new TVs,
they have remotes and they come in color.

31:26.845 --> 31:27.846
Can you imagine that?

31:27.930 --> 31:30.516
Yeah, well, some things
shouldn't change, ever.

31:30.599 --> 31:33.435
My first guest
has flown three times in space,

31:33.519 --> 31:35.854
logging over 4,000 hours in orbit.

31:35.938 --> 31:38.482
But her most famous mission was Apollo 25

31:38.565 --> 31:42.236
when she risked her own life
to rescue astronaut Molly Cobb.

31:42.319 --> 31:43.320
Do you remember that?

31:43.403 --> 31:48.325
It's always a pleasure to have her on
the show. American hero, Tracy Stevens.

31:55.165 --> 31:57.501
Wow, what is she wearing?

31:58.043 --> 31:59.169
Not much.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.005
Great to see ya.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.925
Thank you. It's great to be back.

32:05.008 --> 32:06.802
How many outfits
does she have at this point?

32:06.885 --> 32:10.138
I understand you're just getting back from
vacation in South America. Is that right?

32:10.222 --> 32:12.432
That's right. We were in Rio mostly

32:12.516 --> 32:14.977
and then hopped over
to Aruba for a few days

32:15.060 --> 32:17.229
and then a last-minute visit to Vegas

32:17.312 --> 32:21.191
before coming to beautiful
downtown Burbank to see y'all.

32:21.275 --> 32:23.193
Highlight of your vacation, I'm sure.

32:24.403 --> 32:26.905
I bet Ronnie and Nancy
are watching this in bed right now.

32:26.989 --> 32:29.575
Yeah, in their pj's and their TV trays.

32:29.658 --> 32:32.661
So I have to ask,
is that a new ring on your finger?

32:32.744 --> 32:33.745
Yes.

32:33.829 --> 32:35.289
And does it mean something special?

32:35.789 --> 32:40.752
It does. When Sam and I
were in Vegas, we got married.

32:42.129 --> 32:43.839
Congratulations. Wow.

32:45.465 --> 32:47.217
That's great. Good for you.

32:47.801 --> 32:48.844
Oh, my God.

32:49.678 --> 32:51.471
Guys, can you grab a close-up of this?

32:52.639 --> 32:54.016
Oh, goodness.

32:55.851 --> 32:57.769
What the hell, Trace.

32:57.853 --> 32:59.354
How long have you and Sam...

32:59.438 --> 33:01.607
Just up and get married
without even a phone call?

33:01.690 --> 33:02.691
We can say his name, right?

33:02.774 --> 33:05.068
Sure. Everyone knows who Sam Cleveland is.

33:05.152 --> 33:06.236
Oh, right.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.447
You mean because he's as rich as J.R.?

33:08.530 --> 33:09.573
What?

33:10.866 --> 33:13.702
She left a message
on the machine yesterday.

33:14.870 --> 33:16.705
She didn't say she was getting married.

33:17.414 --> 33:18.832
She kinda sounded loopy?

33:19.499 --> 33:22.169
So I didn't think it was important,
Mom just being Mom.

33:22.252 --> 33:24.004
Left a message on the machine.

33:26.048 --> 33:27.549
Jesus H. Christ.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.051
You met after your last mission?

33:29.134 --> 33:30.511
I'm gonna go play Atari.

33:30.594 --> 33:33.472
That's right. I came back
from helping to repair the...

33:33.555 --> 33:35.307
Hey, Jimmy, wait.

33:37.059 --> 33:39.353
How do you feel about this?

33:39.436 --> 33:41.230
We met and hit it off.

33:41.313 --> 33:44.358
Your mom getting remarried
to Sam Cleveland?

33:46.401 --> 33:49.238
It was funny, actually. See, Sam had...

33:49.321 --> 33:52.491
I don't know.
It's what she wants to do, I guess.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.997
So, how long have you been engaged?

33:59.081 --> 34:01.500
The truth is we were never engaged.

34:01.583 --> 34:02.876
-Hello?
-You weren't?

34:02.960 --> 34:05.045
-Yeah.
-So it was a total surprise.

34:05.128 --> 34:07.631
That's right. Spontaneous,
spur-of-the-moment,

34:07.714 --> 34:09.424
whatever you wanna call it.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.927
-Yeah.
-You watching this shit?

34:12.010 --> 34:14.179
You mean about Mrs. Tracy Cleveland?

34:15.304 --> 34:16.431
Did you know about this?

34:16.514 --> 34:17.599
Hell no.

34:17.683 --> 34:20.268
Yeah. We were in Aruba like I said...

34:20.351 --> 34:23.647
-You okay?
-Yeah. No, I don't know.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.440
I'll take a break.

34:25.524 --> 34:28.402
Shit, I mean, I knew it was gonna
happen eventually, but--

34:28.485 --> 34:30.696
-Been there, done that, sure.
-Yeah.

34:30.779 --> 34:36.076
-This time, he seemed...
-Well, she's his problem now.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.494
You want some company?

34:37.578 --> 34:40.539
Maybe knock back a few?
Maybe more than a few?

34:42.248 --> 34:44.126
Nah, appreciate it. I'll be fine.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.210
Okay.

34:45.293 --> 34:47.838
So we go out to this private little beach,

34:47.920 --> 34:49.005
and I tell you, Johnny,

34:49.089 --> 34:51.884
it was the most beautiful sunset
I've ever seen in my life.

34:51.967 --> 34:53.844
I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.

34:53.927 --> 34:56.263
The sun was just setting,

34:56.346 --> 35:01.518
and the light was shining on the water in
these just brilliant blues and turquoise,

35:01.602 --> 35:05.564
and I looked down,
and next thing I know Sam is on one knee.

35:05.647 --> 35:07.399
And I think to myself,

35:07.482 --> 35:10.027
"Oh, goodness gracious.
What is wrong with this man's leg?"

35:11.486 --> 35:13.864
But I start to get what's going on.

35:13.947 --> 35:18.994
And before I can even take a breath,
he's got this ring in his hand and--

35:19.077 --> 35:21.455
Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos,

35:21.538 --> 35:23.373
whose Democratic Revolutionary Party

35:23.457 --> 35:27.711
recently declared its allegiance to
Marxist-Leninist principles and ideology,

35:27.794 --> 35:29.379
has issued a strong demand

35:29.463 --> 35:33.717
that the United States hand over control
of the canal to the people of Panama,

35:33.800 --> 35:36.929
a demand that Secretary of State
George Shultz rebuffed today

35:37.012 --> 35:38.889
in equally strong language.

36:51.461 --> 36:52.838
Houston, Skylab.

36:52.921 --> 36:55.716
Ready to begin
solar coronagraph observations.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.009
Hey, morning, Skylab.

36:57.092 --> 36:59.178
We got a new CAPCOM on now
with a new crew.

36:59.261 --> 37:03.932
Lab coats in the back room are eager
and waiting for your solar telemetry data.

37:04.016 --> 37:06.226
Is that you, Bill?
You're up bright and early.

37:06.310 --> 37:08.061
Must have drawn
the short straw this morning.

37:08.145 --> 37:11.356
Actually, I tried to
draw an inside straight last night,

37:11.440 --> 37:14.735
ended up swapping out
morning duty for an extra 50.

37:15.485 --> 37:18.697
That sounds like an American
poker reference to me, Bill.

37:18.780 --> 37:23.410
And I look forward to you explaining
all the rules to me in between ATM passes.

37:23.493 --> 37:25.871
It's easier to show you in person.

37:26.413 --> 37:29.708
Maybe you could join our little game
next time you're back in the world.

37:29.791 --> 37:30.792
That sounds grand.

37:30.876 --> 37:34.379
But I hope you don't think I am, as you
Americans would say, an easy mark.

37:34.463 --> 37:36.298
Never crossed my mind, Doreen.

37:37.299 --> 37:38.884
Bring your paycheck.

37:38.967 --> 37:42.346
Okay. I am at the ATM panel.

37:42.429 --> 37:43.764
Starting a run.

37:46.099 --> 37:47.726
Seeing some X-ray emission.

37:47.809 --> 37:50.229
And the particle count is rising.

37:53.106 --> 37:55.567
Image intensity count is exceeding 30.

37:56.693 --> 37:57.694
Fifty.

37:58.529 --> 37:59.530
Wait a minute.

38:04.910 --> 38:10.499
There is a large, a very large
prominence extending out into the corona.

38:10.582 --> 38:14.419
Looks like a major solar flare, but it's
bigger than anything I've ever seen.

38:15.546 --> 38:19.258
Houston, the prominence is at least
100,000 kilometers long already,

38:19.341 --> 38:22.678
and I'm reading
a shower of proton radiation.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.596
Solar flare that size,
there's a good chance

38:24.680 --> 38:26.515
we're gonna have interference
across the broadcast spectrum.

38:26.598 --> 38:28.433
Let's alert the FCC
and get them ready for that.

38:28.517 --> 38:31.478
Flight, JPL just lost contact
with the Mariner 14 probe.

38:31.562 --> 38:36.567
There was a surge in proton radiation
and then zip. Like, it got fried.

38:37.150 --> 38:40.779
Mariner 14 is just inside
the orbit of Mercury.

38:41.530 --> 38:43.866
So it can't be related to the flare.
It's too fast.

38:43.949 --> 38:45.826
Those plasma clouds
never move that quickly.

38:45.909 --> 38:49.329
Maybe, or maybe we've just
never seen them move that fast.

38:52.374 --> 38:53.876
Get management in here.

38:56.336 --> 38:58.380
Singin' sweet songs

38:58.797 --> 39:01.592
-Of melodies pure and true
-Pure and true

39:02.384 --> 39:07.639
Sayin'
"This is my message to you-oo-oo"

39:08.223 --> 39:10.642
-Singin', Don't worry
-Don't worry

39:10.726 --> 39:12.477
About a thing

39:13.270 --> 39:15.522
'Cause every little thing

39:15.606 --> 39:17.566
Is gonna be all right

39:18.817 --> 39:20.444
-Singin', Don't worry
-Don't worry

39:21.486 --> 39:23.280
About a thing

39:24.448 --> 39:26.575
Coronal mass ejection verified.

39:26.658 --> 39:28.785
This is a major solar event.

39:28.869 --> 39:32.539
It's well into S5, bigger than
anything recorded in our observations.

39:32.623 --> 39:35.083
That's bigger than anything
recorded period.

39:36.418 --> 39:37.586
Is that chili?

39:40.464 --> 39:42.841
We're looking at
a few billion tons of solar material

39:42.925 --> 39:44.968
being ejected into space
and heading this way.

39:45.052 --> 39:46.053
Is it dangerous?

39:46.136 --> 39:49.097
The Earth's magnetic field will filter out
most of the hard radiation,

39:49.181 --> 39:50.933
so there's no danger to life on Earth,

39:51.016 --> 39:54.353
but everyone outside of
Earth's atmosphere is at risk.

39:54.436 --> 39:55.604
Like my people on Skylab?

39:55.687 --> 39:57.814
Their orbit is relatively low,

39:57.898 --> 40:00.359
but we need to get them into
a more heavily shielded part of Skylab.

40:00.442 --> 40:02.152
Doreen, you're gonna need to take shelter.

40:02.236 --> 40:04.988
Columbia is still in lunar orbit.
Their crew will have to do the same.

40:05.072 --> 40:08.242
Charlie, get them to hunker down
in the hardened shelter on the mid-deck.

40:08.325 --> 40:11.578
Likewise for Jamestown, we need them
to get into the base storm shelter ASAP.

40:11.662 --> 40:13.580
-Copy, Flight.
-They'll be ready. They trained for this.

40:13.664 --> 40:16.208
But they never trained
for anything this fast.

40:16.291 --> 40:19.419
Coronal mass ejections usually take days
to travel from the sun to the moon.

40:20.128 --> 40:23.090
But this isn't a CME.
This is hard proton radiation.

40:23.173 --> 40:26.677
That's deadly, and it's traveling
at 30% the speed of light.

40:27.427 --> 40:29.054
Which is really fricking fast.

40:30.389 --> 40:32.891
Tell Jamestown to follow
emergency power protocols.

40:32.975 --> 40:35.310
Scram the nuclear reactor,
switch to reserve power.

40:35.394 --> 40:36.395
Copy.

40:36.478 --> 40:39.314
-How long do they have until it hits?
-Less than 30 minutes.

40:46.947 --> 40:50.701
Estimated time
to radiation limit exceedance: 27.

40:51.285 --> 40:53.745
This is Jamestown actual
to all astronauts.

40:53.829 --> 40:56.248
We've got a solar storm coming in,
and it's a hot one.

40:56.331 --> 40:59.084
We've got 27 minutes to get to shelter.

40:59.168 --> 41:00.919
Those of you who can make it
back to Jamestown in time,

41:01.003 --> 41:02.379
you need to get moving now.

41:02.462 --> 41:05.424
If you're too far away, you're
gonna have to find shelter in place.

41:05.507 --> 41:09.011
Find somewhere dark and deep
and sit tight. This is gonna be a bad one.

41:09.469 --> 41:11.054
Go, go, go!

41:11.763 --> 41:13.765
Back to the rover.

41:13.849 --> 41:15.851
Watch your oxygen rates.

41:16.435 --> 41:17.561
Copy that.

41:17.644 --> 41:20.522
Shaw, we're in emergency power protocols.

41:20.606 --> 41:23.942
I need you to take your team
and scram the nuclear reactor.

41:24.026 --> 41:25.652
Roger, Jamestown.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.907
We'll hold the elec cycle for you.

41:32.784 --> 41:34.661
Jamestown, this is Molly.

41:34.745 --> 41:36.955
Wubbo and I are too far out
to make it back.

41:37.039 --> 41:38.790
We're gonna shelter in place.

41:39.416 --> 41:40.792
I'm packing up the rover now.

41:41.502 --> 41:42.961
Copy that.

41:43.045 --> 41:47.382
Ideally, you're gonna need three meters
of regolith between you and the radiation.

41:47.466 --> 41:49.885
But anything is better than nothing
out there.

41:53.972 --> 41:57.267
Good luck. And keep an eye
on your dosimeter badges.

41:59.394 --> 42:01.104
Wubbo, what's your 20?

42:01.188 --> 42:02.606
I'm heading back to base camp.

42:02.689 --> 42:04.399
Probably about two kilometers away,

42:04.483 --> 42:07.903
but it's difficult terrain,
so it will take me at least 15 minutes.

42:07.986 --> 42:10.113
Yeah, same for me.

42:10.197 --> 42:13.659
There's a lava tube right next
to base camp. I'll meet you inside.

42:14.243 --> 42:15.244
Roger that.

42:26.088 --> 42:27.631
Twenty-five minutes.

42:28.674 --> 42:29.675
Mark.

42:49.570 --> 42:50.863
Yes, sir, I will.

42:56.910 --> 42:58.287
This is for Jamestown?

42:59.496 --> 43:00.497
Okay.

43:05.002 --> 43:06.044
I'll be back.

43:15.262 --> 43:17.222
Just got off the horn with NORAD.

43:17.306 --> 43:19.391
They're worried about
losing our early-warning satellites

43:19.474 --> 43:20.684
over the Soviet Union.

43:20.767 --> 43:23.854
Now, they're hardened against radiation
in case of a nuclear attack,

43:23.937 --> 43:26.190
but no one knows how
they're gonna hold up in this situation.

43:27.232 --> 43:28.859
Anything we can do to shield 'em?

43:29.276 --> 43:32.070
If we had more time,
we could try to move them to lower orbits,

43:32.154 --> 43:35.949
but for now, I think the best plan
is to ride it out and see what happens.

43:36.033 --> 43:40.037
If we lose eyes on the USSR, we
have no warning if they decide to launch.

43:40.829 --> 43:43.790
A first strike? Why?

43:44.541 --> 43:45.959
Because of the storm?

43:46.919 --> 43:49.421
That doesn't make any sense.
It's affecting both sides equally.

43:49.505 --> 43:51.256
There's no advantage to either of us.

43:51.340 --> 43:55.219
We can never know why or when the Soviets
might decide to launch a first strike.

43:55.302 --> 43:59.014
That's why we have to have continuous eyes
on the Soviet ICBM fields.

43:59.097 --> 44:00.682
If it makes you feel any better,

44:00.766 --> 44:03.477
they're probably gonna lose
some of their satellites over the US too.

44:06.396 --> 44:07.898
That doesn't make you feel better.

44:13.570 --> 44:15.030
This is Bradford.

44:15.113 --> 44:18.242
There's a strong possibility the Soviets
might lose eyes on North America.

44:20.452 --> 44:21.954
Recommend go to DEFCON 3.

44:23.747 --> 44:24.915
Understood.

44:25.624 --> 44:28.168
Hold on. DEFCON 3?

44:28.710 --> 44:32.339
That's two steps away from nuclear war.
This is a solar storm.

44:32.422 --> 44:34.800
If the Soviets lose eyes on us,
they're gonna worry

44:34.883 --> 44:37.427
that we might take advantage
of the situation and strike first.

44:37.511 --> 44:40.556
And in that case,
they might decide to launch their missiles

44:40.639 --> 44:42.808
to keep us from destroying them
on the ground.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.185
That's crazy.

44:47.646 --> 44:48.647
Let's hope so.

44:58.323 --> 45:00.826
No, just depressurize.
We can refill the tanks later.

45:01.994 --> 45:03.370
Copy that.

45:03.453 --> 45:05.539
All right. Make it safe and lock it down.

45:09.209 --> 45:10.627
Come on, time to go.

45:16.216 --> 45:18.260
How long you think
the storm's gonna last, Chief?

45:18.343 --> 45:20.637
Houston wants us to shelter
for at least three hours.

45:20.721 --> 45:22.806
We're gonna need
an air freshener down there.

45:23.557 --> 45:27.311
Okay. Come on, let's go, let's go,
let's go! Three minutes left. Move!

46:16.068 --> 46:19.530
Okay, Wubbo, I'm outside the lava tube.

46:24.826 --> 46:27.829
Wubbo, what's taking you so long?

46:30.040 --> 46:31.041
Wubbo?

46:31.959 --> 46:33.961
Wubbo. Wubbo Ockels, report.

46:34.044 --> 46:36.088
Earth contact... three...

46:36.171 --> 46:38.257
two... one.

46:39.758 --> 46:42.761
Jamestown colony, this is Houston.
Do you read?

46:45.681 --> 46:47.391
Jamestown, Houston. Do you read?

46:53.981 --> 46:55.232
Wubbo.

46:58.694 --> 47:00.320
Come on, Wubbo.

47:01.822 --> 47:02.990
Wubby-Wubby-woo.

47:04.283 --> 47:05.993
You're starting to scare me here.

47:17.087 --> 47:18.672
Oh, shit.

47:24.887 --> 47:26.847
Jamestown colony,
this is Houston. Do you read?

47:26.930 --> 47:28.432
CAPCOM, you can stand down.

47:28.515 --> 47:29.766
We're in the thick of it now.

47:29.850 --> 47:32.352
There's no way we'll reach them
until the storm has passed.

47:55.459 --> 47:57.419
What was the last head count?

47:57.503 --> 48:01.256
Ten minutes ago, 14 were in the shelter
and three within visual sight of the base.

48:02.716 --> 48:05.594
Don't worry. Ellen will get them inside
and buttoned up.

48:06.303 --> 48:08.222
What about Molly and Wubbo?

48:11.725 --> 48:13.268
Molly is a survivor.

48:13.936 --> 48:15.521
Trust me. They'll be okay.

48:22.819 --> 48:26.281
Three more satellites. Jesus.

48:28.742 --> 48:31.078
White House is about to put out
a statement to the country

48:31.161 --> 48:35.165
explaining the storm and that there might
be radio and television interruption soon,

48:35.249 --> 48:36.959
but that everyone should be fine.

48:37.042 --> 48:40.671
Be better if Reagan himself
got on TV and reassured people.

48:40.754 --> 48:43.090
-He's good at that.
-He can't.

48:43.173 --> 48:44.758
The president's on Air Force One.

48:47.469 --> 48:49.513
Joint Chiefs decided to get him in the air

48:49.596 --> 48:52.975
in case the Soviets try to make a move
during the satellite blackout.

48:54.518 --> 48:55.853
We staying at DEFCON 3?

48:57.062 --> 48:58.105
For now.

48:59.231 --> 49:01.275
The storm is about to hit the moon.

49:13.412 --> 49:15.080
Molly, this is Ellen.

49:15.706 --> 49:17.624
The storm is seconds from impact.

49:17.708 --> 49:21.420
All communication will be disrupted.
So you and Wubbo need to remain in place.

49:21.503 --> 49:26.049
Repeat, remain in place until
you have received the all clear from me.

49:27.134 --> 49:28.635
Good luck and Godspeed.

49:39.980 --> 49:41.106
My God.

49:56.580 --> 49:58.707
How much radiation can someone take?

50:00.876 --> 50:02.211
It varies...

50:02.294 --> 50:07.549
by gender, body weight, age,
a host of other factors.

50:07.633 --> 50:12.179
But basically, a dose of ten millirems
is like getting a chest X-ray.

50:13.430 --> 50:16.058
A thousand rems will kill you in an hour.

50:18.685 --> 50:20.938
And exposures in between,

50:21.522 --> 50:25.108
you're talking increasingly bigger
and bigger chances of developing cancer

50:25.192 --> 50:26.860
over a period of time.

50:29.154 --> 50:31.281
It becomes a numbers game.

50:34.368 --> 50:37.162
Each astronaut wears a dosimeter badge.

50:38.872 --> 50:43.418
It monitors their exposure to radiation
the whole time they're on the moon.

50:44.378 --> 50:45.629
Your badge is green...

50:46.630 --> 50:48.423
your body's clean.

50:49.466 --> 50:51.510
Your badge is red...

50:52.302 --> 50:53.679
You're dead?

50:55.347 --> 50:56.723
It's not good.

50:58.100 --> 50:59.560
Let's put it that way.

51:00.936 --> 51:02.396
It's not good at all.

52:13.091 --> 52:14.176
Wubbo.

52:16.094 --> 52:17.137
Wubbo.
