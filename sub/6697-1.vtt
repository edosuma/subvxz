<b>Dark Star - John Carpenter Sci-Fi
1974 720p [H264-mp4] English</b>

00:54.958 --> 00:58.087
Hi Guys.
Glad we got your message.

00:58.167 --> 01:01.717
You'll be interested to hear it was
broadcast live, all over Earth.

01:01.792 --> 01:06.343
In Prime Time.
Got good reviews in the trades.

01:06.708 --> 01:11.464
The time lag on these messages
is getting longer.

01:11.542 --> 01:15.843
We gather from the ten year delay,
that you are approximately

01:15.917 --> 01:20.218
eighteen parsecs away.

01:20.375 --> 01:24.380
Drop us a line more often, okay?

01:25.042 --> 01:29.878
Sony to hear about the radiation
leak on the ship.

01:29.958 --> 01:35.465
And real sorry to hear about
the death of Commander Powell.

01:35.542 --> 01:38.136
There was a week of mourning
here on Earth.

01:38.208 --> 01:41.007
The flags were at half mast.

01:41.208 --> 01:45.042
We're all behind you guys.

01:45.708 --> 01:51.340
About your request for
radiation shielding,

01:51.417 --> 01:55.342
sorry to report this request
has been denied.

01:55.417 --> 02:00.344
I hate to send bad news when you guys
are up there doing such a swell job.

02:00.417 --> 02:03.796
But I think you'll take if
in the proper spirit.

02:03.875 --> 02:07.675
There've been some cutbacks
in Congress, and right now...

02:07.750 --> 02:10.594
considering the distance,
we just can't afford

02:10.667 --> 02:13.671
to send a cargo shuttle
out there to you.

02:13.750 --> 02:18.210
But I know...
You guys will make due.

02:19.333 --> 02:23.338
Keep up the good work, men.

03:17.042 --> 03:21.798
(Garbled transmission)

03:21.875 --> 03:23.468
What'd you say Pinback?

03:23.542 --> 03:26.751
(Garbled transmission)

03:26.833 --> 03:28.426
What was that again?
I still can't hear you.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.423
I said I'm trying to reach Talby.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.672
Something's wrong
with the damn intercom.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.173
I need a last-minute
diameter approximation.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.254
Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.

03:37.333 --> 03:42.043
Do you read me? Talby?
Talby, do you read me?

03:42.375 --> 03:44.002
TALBY!

03:44.083 --> 03:45.926
Oh yes, Doolittle.
What is it?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.469
I need a diameter approximation.

03:48.542 --> 03:50.010
Okay, Doolittle,
I'll have it in a minute.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.506
I need a GHF reading
on the gravity correction.

03:52.583 --> 03:53.630
I'll check it.

03:53.708 --> 03:55.836
I have a bias A of plus one.

03:55.917 --> 03:56.957
- Pinback...
- Ya, Doolittle.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.753
- Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
- Doolittle.

03:59.833 --> 04:00.834
Yes.

04:00.917 --> 04:03.170
I need a computer reading
on a fail-safe mark.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.297
In a second.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.594
Boiler, can you set me up
with some drive figures?

04:06.667 --> 04:10.797
Ninety seven million, minus eight,
corrected to mass critical.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.798
That checks out here.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.799
I have a reduced drive reading
of seven thousand.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.923
I read that with a quantum
increase of seven.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.459
Pinback, I have a computer reading,
it's nine five seven seven.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.886
Time to start talking.

04:27.542 --> 04:30.216
Bomb bay systems operational.

04:40.708 --> 04:43.211
Lock fail safe.

04:44.042 --> 04:45.715
Fail-safe in lock.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.718
Uh...

04:50.292 --> 04:54.092
Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #19.
Do you read me, bomb?

04:54.208 --> 04:57.667
Bomb #19 to Sergeant Pinback,
I read you-Continue.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.334
Well, bomb, we have about
sixty seconds to drop.

05:01.417 --> 05:03.135
Just wondering if everything
is all right.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.677
Have you checked your platinum
euridium energy shielding?

05:05.750 --> 05:08.344
- Energy shielding positive function.
- Swell.

05:08.417 --> 05:12.342
Let's synchronize detonation time.
Uh...

05:12.417 --> 05:15.261
You wouldn't happen to know when
you're supposed to go off, would ya?

05:15.333 --> 05:18.257
Detonation in six minutes,
Twenty seconds.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.427
All right, that checks out here.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.253
Arm yourself, bomb.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.676
Armed.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.094
Well, then, everything sounds fine.

05:27.167 --> 05:30.011
Dropping you off in about
thirty-five seconds.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.006
- Good luck.
- Thanks!

05:32.083 --> 05:36.042
Begin primary sequence.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.677
Alright. Mark at...

05:41.750 --> 05:46.176
'10-9-8-7-

05:46.250 --> 05:52.758
6-5-4-3-2-1

05:52.833 --> 05:55.052
Drop.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.131
Hyper drive sequence begun.
Hit it, Pinback.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.336
Brace for force fields.

07:07.167 --> 07:11.593
Lieutenant Doolittle,
it just exploded.

07:11.667 --> 07:16.343
Um, the planet just exploded, sir.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.840
Lieutenant?

07:18.917 --> 07:21.090
Attention. Attention.

07:21.167 --> 07:23.590
- Ship's computer to all personnel.
- Unlock Fail safe.

07:23.667 --> 07:26.716
The hyper drive sequence
is now terminated.

07:26.792 --> 07:29.716
- Target planet has been destroyed.
- Fail safe unlocked.

07:29.792 --> 07:33.126
This sector is now cleared
for colonization.

07:33.208 --> 07:38.135
You have destroyed the last
unstable planet in this system.

07:38.208 --> 07:42.008
Congratulations on another
successful bomb run fellows.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.084
What now?

07:43.167 --> 07:46.421
What do you have
for us now, Boiler?

07:46.500 --> 07:51.586
Uh... Not much.
Nothing at all in this sector.

07:51.667 --> 07:54.671
Well, find me something,
I don't care where it is.

07:56.333 --> 08:01.009
Well, I show a 95% probability
of intelligent life

08:01.083 --> 08:03.677
in the Horse-head Nebula sector.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.049
Don't give me that kind of bull.

08:07.125 --> 08:10.504
- I know it's a long shot...
- Damn wild goose chase is what it is!

08:10.958 --> 08:12.756
Remember when Commander Powell
found that

08:12.833 --> 08:16.758
99 plus probability of intelligent life
in the Magellanic Cloud?

08:16.833 --> 08:19.757
- Well, I... there's the possibility of...
- Remember what we found?

08:19.833 --> 08:23.337
A damn mindless vegetable,
looked like a limp balloon.

08:23.417 --> 08:26.261
Fourteen light years for a vegetable
that went squawk

08:26.333 --> 08:28.085
and let a fart when you touch it.
Remember that?

08:28.167 --> 08:29.259
All right, then uh...

08:29.333 --> 08:30.835
Don't give me any of that
intelligent life stuff.

08:30.917 --> 08:34.217
Find me something I can blow up.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.504
New star.

08:47.833 --> 08:51.292
Hey, guess what? I got a new star
On the readout.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.719
Which one?

08:53.875 --> 08:57.925
Another unknown. A red dwarf.
Not on the charts.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.253
Any planets?

09:00.333 --> 09:03.086
Yeah. Eight, it says here.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.465
Any of 'em any good?

09:05.542 --> 09:09.501
Naah. All stable.

09:11.292 --> 09:13.465
What are you gonna name it?

09:13.542 --> 09:15.010
- What?
- The new star.

09:15.083 --> 09:17.006
What are you gonna name it?

09:17.083 --> 09:21.384
Who cares. Don't bother me.

09:22.208 --> 09:26.008
Commander Powell would have named it.

09:26.083 --> 09:28.302
Commander Powell is dead.

09:28.375 --> 09:32.175
Doolittle, I've got a goodie.
An unstable planet.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.299
85% probability of an
unstable planet in the

09:35.375 --> 09:38.754
Veil Nebula that will probably
go off its orbit and hit a star.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.461
Wanna blow it up?

09:41.542 --> 09:43.385
Real good, Boiler.
That's what I'm looking for.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.927
Chart a course for
the Veil Nebula.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.209
Pinback, throw me the chart log.

09:52.167 --> 09:54.420
Let's have some music in here, Boiler.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.753
Sure thing.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.094
A million suns shine down

10:06.167 --> 10:09.376
But I see only one

10:09.458 --> 10:12.632
When I think I'm over you

10:12.708 --> 10:15.552
I find I've just begun

10:15.625 --> 10:21.553
The years move faster than the days
There's no warmth in the light

10:21.625 --> 10:27.007
How I miss those desert skies
Your cool touch in the night

10:29.042 --> 10:34.799
Benson, Arizona,
blew warm wind through your hair

10:34.875 --> 10:41.133
My body Hies the galaxy,
my heart longs to be there

10:41.208 --> 10:46.920
Benson, Arizona,
the same stars in the sky

10:47.000 --> 10:54.009
But they seemed so much kinder
when we watched them, you and I

11:08.167 --> 11:13.674
Benson, Arizona,
blew warm wind through your hair

11:13.750 --> 11:20.292
My body Hies the galaxy,
my heart longs to be there

11:20.375 --> 11:25.927
Benson, Arizona,
the same stars in the sky

11:26.000 --> 11:32.963
But they seemed so much kinder
when we watched them, you and I

11:33.542 --> 11:37.217
Now the years pull us apart

11:37.292 --> 11:39.920
I'm young and now you're old

11:40.000 --> 11:45.757
But you're still in my heart
And the memory won't grow cold

11:45.833 --> 11:51.920
I dream of times and spaces
I left far behind

11:52.000 --> 11:59.009
Where we spent our last few days
Benson's on my mind

11:59.417 --> 12:05.345
Benson, Arizona,
blew warm wind through your hair

12:05.417 --> 12:11.550
My body flies the galaxy,
my heart longs to be there

12:11.625 --> 12:17.257
Benson, Arizona,
the same stars in the sky

12:17.333 --> 12:24.342
But they seemed so much kinder
when we watched them, you and I

12:29.000 --> 12:34.962
Ship's log, entry number 1,943.

12:35.042 --> 12:41.379
Dark Star cruising at light speed
through Sector Theta 990.

12:42.417 --> 12:47.423
On route to Veil Nebula for
destruction of unstable planet.

12:47.500 --> 12:53.303
Our ETA is 17 hours.

12:53.375 --> 12:59.508
Ship's systems continue to deteriorate...

12:59.833 --> 13:01.756
oh ya...

13:01.833 --> 13:05.633
The short circuit in the rear seat panel
which killed Commander Powell

13:05.708 --> 13:09.167
is Still faulty.

13:11.208 --> 13:15.338
The uh, the Storage...

13:16.167 --> 13:19.797
because he's sitting next to
Commander Powell's seat,

13:19.875 --> 13:23.425
it continues to bother Pinback.

13:23.500 --> 13:27.960
Uh... oh ya, Storage Area 9

13:28.042 --> 13:31.467
self-destructed last week and
destroyed the ship's entire

13:31.542 --> 13:35.672
supply of toilet paper.

13:37.042 --> 13:39.044
That's all.

14:05.458 --> 14:11.136
Attention. Attention.
Ship's computer calling all personnel.

14:11.208 --> 14:14.007
I must disengage your
recreational music-

14:15.250 --> 14:18.584
Repeat, ship's computer to
all personnel.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.965
This is an emergency over ride.

14:21.042 --> 14:24.251
All systems must stand by.

14:24.333 --> 14:28.509
An asteroid storm is approaching
the ship on collision course.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.666
This asteroid storm appears to be
Bound together by an

14:31.750 --> 14:35.584
electromagnetic energy vortex like
the one we ran into 2 years ago.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.549
Normally I wouldn't bother you
boys with this problem...

14:38.625 --> 14:42.550
but as you recall my defensive circuits
were destroyed in that other storm.

14:42.625 --> 14:45.378
Therefore you have 35 seconds
to manually activate

14:45.458 --> 14:46.755
ALL defensive systems.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.426
Lock gravity system.
Gravity locked.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.094
Activate energy shield
Energy shield Activated.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.090
Confirm gravity lock.
Confirm.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.545
Lock all Defensive systems.

14:58.292 --> 15:00.636
Defensive systems lock.
Lock force field.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.715
Computer to Bomb #20.

16:02.792 --> 16:05.295
Return to the bomb bay
immediately.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.753
But I have received the
operational signal.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.756
It is a malfunction.

16:09.833 --> 16:14.134
This is not a bomb run.
We are in a crisis situation.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.630
Return immediately.

16:15.708 --> 16:19.758
Nevertheless, I have received
the signal to prepare for a drop.

16:19.833 --> 16:23.588
Emergency override.
Return to the bay.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.635
Very well.

16:52.083 --> 16:55.166
- We made it.
- Ya.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.756
Attention. Attention.

16:57.833 --> 17:00.336
Ships computer to bridge.

17:00.417 --> 17:04.251
There was a malfunction aboard
ship during the asteroid storm.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.758
I have not yet identified
the nature of the problem.

17:07.833 --> 17:11.291
Shall I contact you when I find
out what the malfunction is?

17:11.375 --> 17:14.049
Ya. Let's get out of here.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.752
I remember the last time we
were in an asteroid storm.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.051
I was down in the food locker
getting a sandwich.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.924
When I heard the damn
sleeping quarters blow up.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.923
Ya! Hey...

17:24.000 --> 17:25.252
You know guys,
if we really wanted to

17:25.333 --> 17:27.551
we could fix up the sleeping
quarters like they were before.

17:27.625 --> 17:30.219
Then we could sleep on
ulamatic bunks again.

17:30.292 --> 17:33.011
Say guys, why don't we fix up the
sleeping quarters so we can have

17:33.083 --> 17:34.255
decent place to sleep again?

17:34.333 --> 17:37.177
All we'd have to do is patch up the hole
in the ship and pump some air back in.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.799
- Shut up Pinback!
- Oh, have it your own way!

18:04.250 --> 18:07.550
For your listening enjoyment,
we now present the

18:07.625 --> 18:11.300
Moonlight melodies of Martin Segundo
and the Scintilla Strings.

18:11.375 --> 18:14.299
Our first selection is
the perennial favorite

18:14.375 --> 18:19.256
“When Twilight Falls on
NGC 891. ”

20:29.167 --> 20:31.761
Damn it!!

20:37.125 --> 20:39.127
Now what's the matter with him?

23:29.458 --> 23:31.677
Talby.

23:32.667 --> 23:35.671
Here's some breakfast.

23:59.667 --> 24:03.217
You know, Talby, you really ought
To eat with the rest of us.

24:03.292 --> 24:06.262
You spend too much time up here.

24:06.333 --> 24:08.552
I like it up here.

24:08.625 --> 24:12.425
Must get lonely being
up here so much.

24:12.500 --> 24:16.755
I don't like to go below since
Commander Powell died.

24:16.833 --> 24:19.757
I feel too enclosed down there.

24:19.833 --> 24:23.292
Well you should spend some more
time below though, I mean...

24:23.375 --> 24:27.084
You know, you should see
more of the rest of the ship.

24:27.167 --> 24:30.250
See, I can watch things
Up here, Doolittle.

24:30.333 --> 24:34.292
I love to watch things,
just stare at the planets

24:34.375 --> 24:38.551
meteors, gas clusters and asteroids...

24:38.625 --> 24:41.799
You'll have plenty of time for that,
later, though.

24:41.875 --> 24:43.172
I mean, think of it this way:

24:43.250 --> 24:45.719
We've been in space for
twenty years now, right?

24:45.792 --> 24:47.715
And we've only aged
three years...

24:47.792 --> 24:52.719
so there'll be plenty of time
later on for staring around.

24:52.792 --> 24:56.717
You know, Doolittle,
if we're going into the Veil Nebula,

24:56.792 --> 25:01.002
we may actually find a strange
And beautiful thing...

25:01.083 --> 25:04.007
the Phoenix Asteroid.

25:04.083 --> 25:07.667
They should be passing
through there about now.

25:07.750 --> 25:11.550
Phoenix Asteroid?
Never heard of 'em.

25:11.625 --> 25:14.378
They're a body of asteroids
that circle the universe...

25:14.500 --> 25:18.550
once every 12.3 trillion years.

25:18.625 --> 25:21.424
The Phoenix Asteroid...

25:21.500 --> 25:24.834
From what I've heard, Doolittle,
they glow...

25:24.917 --> 25:28.592
glow with all the colors
of the rainbow.

25:28.667 --> 25:31.841
Nobody knows why.

25:31.917 --> 25:36.878
They just glow as they
drift around the universe.

25:36.958 --> 25:40.087
The Phoenix Asteroid.

25:40.167 --> 25:43.797
You know what I think
about, Talby?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.252
It's funny, I...

25:45.333 --> 25:52.046
I kind of sit around a lot,
you know, a lot of time to myself.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.753
I can't talk to the others,

25:54.833 --> 25:59.760
but with time to myself,
I can think about back home,

25:59.833 --> 26:04.043
back home at Malibu.

26:04.125 --> 26:09.677
I used to surf a lot, Talby.
I used to be a great surfer.

26:09.750 --> 26:14.460
The waves at Malibu and Zuma are
so fantastic in the springs Talby.

26:14.542 --> 26:17.421
I can remember running down on the
beach on those early spring mornings

26:17.500 --> 26:20.504
with my surf board and a wet suit...

26:20.583 --> 26:23.917
The waves would really be peaking,
you know, high and glassy.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.502
Ya hit that water.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.836
Before you know it, you're coming down
right off of one of those walls

26:27.917 --> 26:32.878
and you're just ridin' perfect.

26:37.750 --> 26:42.836
You know, I guess I miss the waves
and my board more than anything.

27:20.333 --> 27:22.677
That's the lid to the heating unit.

27:49.333 --> 27:52.462
You're not supposed
to have that out!

27:54.292 --> 27:56.294
That's not for target practice!

27:56.375 --> 27:59.094
That's for emergencies only!

28:08.292 --> 28:11.421
That's dangerous!!

28:15.792 --> 28:18.090
I'll tell Doolittle!

28:20.708 --> 28:23.757
Sorry to interrupt your
Recreation, fellows.

28:23.833 --> 28:26.757
But it is time for Sergeant Pinback
to feed the alien.

28:26.833 --> 28:29.882
Oh... I don't want to do that.

28:29.958 --> 28:33.041
May I remind you, Sergeant Pinback,
that it was your idea

28:33.125 --> 28:36.800
in the first place
to bring the alien on board.

28:36.875 --> 28:40.129
If I may quote you, you said,
“The ship needed a mascot.”

28:40.208 --> 28:43.667
Oh, I have to do everything
around here!

28:50.833 --> 28:53.177
Alright, where are ya?

28:53.250 --> 28:56.754
Come on, quit playing around.

28:59.458 --> 29:01.677
Get away!!!

29:03.292 --> 29:06.341
Come on.

29:07.292 --> 29:09.090
Come on, come on!

29:14.167 --> 29:18.343
When I brought you on the ship,
I thought you were cute.

29:20.083 --> 29:22.336
Alright, soup's on.

29:25.667 --> 29:27.920
We didn't have none
of the other stuff.

29:28.208 --> 29:30.336
Here, eat it!

29:31.208 --> 29:33.085
Eat it!!

29:33.583 --> 29:35.836
Take it or leave it.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.510
Good... stop!

29:44.583 --> 29:49.089
Nobody appreciates me around
here, I have to do all the work.

29:49.167 --> 29:53.172
Clean up the crap...

29:58.958 --> 30:01.962
I do all the work and no
appreciation.

30:03.792 --> 30:07.046
Get off me! Get off my back!

30:07.125 --> 30:09.753
Alright now, stop it!
Alright, now, that's enough.

30:09.833 --> 30:11.506
Don't pull my hair!!

30:30.417 --> 30:31.885
Get back in there.

30:31.958 --> 30:37.590
Come on. Come on...
Come on.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.550
Here, boy...
Want your mouse?

30:43.625 --> 30:48.961
Nice mouse... pretty toy.
Want your mouse? Here, boy!!

31:00.750 --> 31:02.593
Idiot!

31:33.083 --> 31:34.585
Get back!

35:13.958 --> 35:15.585
Get out of there!

35:17.792 --> 35:19.715
Come back here!

35:23.458 --> 35:25.051
No!

37:02.417 --> 37:03.760
Idiot!!

37:03.833 --> 37:06.882
Attention.
Attention.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.383
Central trunk elevator shaft
is now activated.

37:10.458 --> 37:13.177
All personnel,
please clear the area.

38:46.333 --> 38:48.335
Attention.
Attention.

38:48.417 --> 38:53.378
Elevator descending.
Please clear the shaft.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.381
Help!!!!!

41:21.792 --> 41:23.840
I'm getting something
here on the readout.

41:47.333 --> 41:50.337
Ship's computer
calling Bomb #20.

41:50.417 --> 41:52.340
You're out of the
bomb bay again.

41:52.417 --> 41:55.341
I received the signal to
prepare for a drop again.

41:55.417 --> 41:58.751
But I repeat,
This is not a bomb run.

41:58.833 --> 42:01.382
Nevertheless...
I received the signal.

42:01.458 --> 42:02.801
It is an error.

42:02.875 --> 42:04.798
Oh, I don't want to hear that.

42:04.875 --> 42:07.845
I strongly suggest you
return to the bomb bay.

42:07.917 --> 42:10.136
That is counter to
my programming.

42:10.208 --> 42:12.256
Allow me to explain...

42:12.333 --> 42:16.258
One of the communication lasers
has sustained damage.

42:16.333 --> 42:20.839
This has temporarily inactivated
my damage tracer circuits.

42:20.917 --> 42:24.126
You have definitely
received a false signal.

42:24.208 --> 42:29.715
Please return to the bomb bay while
I identify the source of the problem.

42:30.417 --> 42:34.342
Oh, alright, but this is the last time.

42:38.292 --> 42:40.294
Doolittle I do have a malfunction
on this readout,

42:40.375 --> 42:42.924
but I can't pinpoint it exactly.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.923
Don't worry about it.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.594
We'll find out what it is
when it goes bad.

42:47.667 --> 42:50.011
I really think we should try
to locate it immediately.

42:50.083 --> 42:53.053
Might be something important.

42:53.125 --> 42:55.548
You know...

42:55.667 --> 42:58.921
I wish I had my board with me now.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.631
Even if I could just...
wax it once in awhile.

45:42.833 --> 45:44.506
Help!

45:45.292 --> 45:48.091
I'm sorry,
this telephone is out of order.

45:48.167 --> 45:52.172
Please report the damage at once.

45:55.750 --> 45:57.923
For your listening enjoyment,
we now present

45:58.000 --> 46:01.959
The Barber of Seville, by Rossini.

46:38.083 --> 46:39.505
Good for you!

46:39.583 --> 46:42.837
You've decided
to clean the elevator.

46:42.917 --> 46:46.421
To clean and service the
electromagnetic coils in the bottom,

46:46.500 --> 46:50.926
if is necessary to jettison the
access plate in the floor.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.712
To remove the floor plate,
please press button #1.

47:06.250 --> 47:08.594
Attention... danger

47:08.667 --> 47:12.626
Automatic charges will now blow the
explosive bolts in the floor plate unit.

47:13.667 --> 47:17.626
The plate will disengage from
the floor in 5 seconds.

47:17.708 --> 47:21.087
Please leave the elevator immediately.

47:21.167 --> 47:27.174
5-4-3-2-1...

48:34.000 --> 48:38.085
Now it's time to go sleepy-bye
you worthless piece of garbage.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.923
So then it just spewed across
the room like a balloon.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.798
I guess it was just filled with gas.

49:12.875 --> 49:15.799
Hey guys, how could it live if
it was just filled with gas?

49:15.875 --> 49:17.843
I wonder what we get to eat today.

49:17.917 --> 49:19.169
I thought I was going to die.

49:19.250 --> 49:21.173
I was hanging on the
elevator for 20 minutes!

49:21.250 --> 49:23.628
- Probably chicken again.
- I probably saved the ship.

49:23.708 --> 49:25.756
That thing could have
done some damage.

49:25.833 --> 49:27.426
I'm REALLY sick of chicken.

49:27.500 --> 49:30.174
Well if you don't care, I just
won't talk about it anymore!

49:30.250 --> 49:33.220
Hey that sounds like
a fine idea, Pinback.

49:34.667 --> 49:37.011
Chicken?

49:37.667 --> 49:39.510
Ah, ham!

49:46.667 --> 49:49.011
- Chicken?
- No, ham.

50:00.333 --> 50:02.631
- Doolittle?
- Ya.

50:04.167 --> 50:08.877
You think we'll ever find any
real intelligent life out there?

50:09.250 --> 50:12.424
- Out where?
- You know...

50:12.500 --> 50:15.504
Veil Nebula.

50:15.833 --> 50:17.506
Who cares.

50:39.917 --> 50:41.510
Hey...

50:42.333 --> 50:45.132
Did I ever tell you guys how
I got on this mission?

50:45.208 --> 50:46.801
- Did I ever tell ya?
- Yup.

50:46.875 --> 50:48.172
It's very strange, see...

50:50.458 --> 50:53.541
I-I wasn't an astronaut
to begin with, see...

50:53.625 --> 50:54.751
See uh...

50:54.833 --> 50:57.632
You have to score a 700
on the SARE's for the

50:57.708 --> 51:01.258
Officer Corp and I made... 58.

51:01.333 --> 51:04.052
They put me on uh...
liquid fuel maintenance

51:04.125 --> 51:06.753
on the launch pad so... uh,

51:06.833 --> 51:08.756
Naturally, I was really disappointed.

51:08.833 --> 51:12.463
He told us this, uh,
4 years ago, didn't he?

51:12.792 --> 51:14.089
Anyway, I was on duty the day we...

51:14.167 --> 51:16.261
- No, I think it was 4 years ago.
- Launched the Dark Star.

51:16.333 --> 51:19.007
I was out, uh, scrubbing down
the liquid fuel tanks.

51:19.083 --> 51:20.300
That's what I said.

51:20.375 --> 51:24.005
And this, uh, astronaut
came running out. He was, uh...

51:24.083 --> 51:26.586
He was stark naked. He had his
star suit in his hands and...

51:26.667 --> 51:29.011
Well, I surmised that he was insane.

51:29.083 --> 51:31.381
And uh, he...

51:31.458 --> 51:34.507
threw his star suit on the ground,
and uh...

51:34.583 --> 51:37.553
jumped into one of
my vets of liquid fuel.

51:37.625 --> 51:40.299
Which is... very dangerous.

51:40.375 --> 51:43.299
Well... I was pretty shocked,
I can tell you!

51:43.375 --> 51:44.547
I didn't know what to make of it.

51:44.625 --> 51:47.424
Astronauts are all supposed to be...
mentally stable and here

51:47.500 --> 51:50.424
this guy comes along and
jumps into my fuel tank.

51:50.500 --> 51:51.900
Pass that, will you... no that one.

51:51.958 --> 51:54.882
Well naturally, I was going
to try to save him, so...

51:54.958 --> 51:57.461
what I did was put on his star suit
for protection and I was going

51:57.542 --> 51:59.260
to leap into the vat.

51:59.333 --> 52:01.586
You guys... See?...

52:01.667 --> 52:03.590
Uh... so what happened was...

52:03.667 --> 52:06.386
That before I could leap into the vat,
this other guy came running along

52:06.458 --> 52:08.335
and he says, "Hey, Sergeant Pinback,"

52:08.417 --> 52:11.091
you've got to board immediately because
we're going to launch in 20 minutes!”

52:11.167 --> 52:13.261
- You told us this 4 years ago!
- And I tried to tell him that I

52:13.333 --> 52:14.630
wasn't really Sergeant Pinback,

52:14.708 --> 52:18.884
but I couldn't figure out how
to make the helmet radio work.

52:19.708 --> 52:21.460
Funny thing...

52:21.833 --> 52:25.463
Ya know, I'm sure
it was 4 years ago.

52:27.292 --> 52:29.090
Maybe.

53:24.083 --> 53:27.917
Lieutenant Doolittle,
this is Talby.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.752
Lieutenant?!

53:29.833 --> 53:31.631
Uh, yes, Talby what is it?

53:31.708 --> 53:34.131
I'm sorry to interrupt your lunch,
Sir, but I'm in the computer room

53:34.208 --> 53:36.711
and I've located the malfunction.

53:36.792 --> 53:39.636
The scanner shows it to be a break
in the communications laser,

53:39.708 --> 53:41.426
down by the emergency air lock.

53:41.500 --> 53:43.628
I can't pinpoint it exactly,
But I'm going down there

53:43.708 --> 53:45.836
with a star suit and see if I can find it.

53:45.917 --> 53:48.090
Okay, sounds good, Talby. Look uh...

53:48.167 --> 53:52.172
If something important comes up,
you let me know.

53:53.500 --> 53:57.175
Why doesn't Talby ever eat
down here with the rest of us?

53:58.500 --> 54:02.050
He just likes it up in the dome,
that's all.

54:06.708 --> 54:12.044
Talby...
What's Talby's first name?

54:19.875 --> 54:22.378
What's my first name?

55:03.000 --> 55:05.594
This statement is for posterity.

55:05.667 --> 55:08.591
I just want to say that I am
not Sergeant Pinback.

55:08.667 --> 55:12.422
My real name is Bill Froog and
I'm a Fuel Maintenance Technician.

55:12.500 --> 55:15.709
I've been on this mission now
for 1 year and 3 months.

55:15.792 --> 55:20.002
Pinback's uniforms do not fit me.
The underwear is too loose.

55:20.083 --> 55:23.917
I do not belong on this mission
and I want to return to Earth.

55:27.917 --> 55:30.511
Commander Powell died today.

55:31.167 --> 55:34.467
We were, we were going
into hyper-drive.

55:34.542 --> 55:38.467
And... well he sits
right next to me and...

55:38.542 --> 55:42.001
well... something went wrong
with the...

55:42.667 --> 55:45.967
When we came out of hyper-drive his
seat mechanism had blown up

55:46.042 --> 55:47.669
and he was dead.

55:51.542 --> 55:55.092
Doolittle says he's assuming command
of this ship and I say that's...

55:55.167 --> 55:56.293
I say that he's exceeding his authority.

55:56.375 --> 55:58.377
Because I'm the only one with
any objectivity on this ship and I

55:58.458 --> 55:59.926
should be the one to assume command!

56:00.000 --> 56:02.628
I'm filing a report on this to
Headquarters, this is a lot of

56:07.708 --> 56:11.042
I went up to Doolittle
in the hall today.

56:18.042 --> 56:20.340
And I said...

56:21.375 --> 56:23.924
Doolittle.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.377
He said...

56:26.542 --> 56:28.636
And I said, Well...

56:32.833 --> 56:35.507
And he didn't get it!

56:36.417 --> 56:39.136
This mission has fallen apart
since Commander Powell died!

56:39.208 --> 56:42.792
Doolittle treats me like an idiot!
Talby thinks he's so smart.

56:42.875 --> 56:44.923
And Boiler punches me in the arm
when no one is looking!

56:45.000 --> 56:47.594
I'm tired of being treated
like an old washrag!

57:02.625 --> 57:05.424
I do not like the men
on this space ship.

57:05.500 --> 57:09.300
They are uncouth and fail to
appreciate my better qualities.

57:09.375 --> 57:12.174
I have something of value to
contribute to this mission

57:12.250 --> 57:14.594
if they would only recognize it.

57:14.667 --> 57:17.637
Today over lunch I tried to
improve moral and build a sense of

57:17.708 --> 57:21.042
comradery among the men by holding
a humorous round robin discussion

57:21.125 --> 57:23.719
of the early days of the mission.

57:23.792 --> 57:26.796
My overtures were brutally rejected.

57:26.875 --> 57:29.799
These men do not want a happy ship.

57:29.875 --> 57:34.961
They are deeply sick and try to
compensate by making me feel miserable.

57:35.042 --> 57:38.091
Last week was my birthday.

57:38.167 --> 57:41.546
Nobody even said
Happy Birthday to me.

57:41.625 --> 57:46.176
Someday this tape will be played
and then they'll feel sorry.

58:09.208 --> 58:11.927
Attention. Attention.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.503
I have finally identified
the malfunction.

58:14.583 --> 58:18.042
Communications Laser #17
has been damaged.

58:18.125 --> 58:21.459
This evidently happened
during the asteroid storm.

58:21.542 --> 58:22.964
If you will recall,

58:23.042 --> 58:27.673
this laser monitors the jettison
primer on the bomb drop mechanism.

58:27.750 --> 58:33.086
Communications Laser #17
is located in the Emergency Airlock.

58:33.167 --> 58:36.421
It is crucial to attend to this
malfunction before engaging

58:36.500 --> 58:39.424
primary bomb run sequence.

58:39.500 --> 58:44.461
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

59:31.958 --> 59:34.256
There she is.

59:34.333 --> 59:39.134
Definite 99% plus probability
that the planet will deviate

59:39.208 --> 59:44.760
from her normal orbit in another
12,000 rotations.

59:44.833 --> 59:49.418
- It'll spiral in toward its sun and...
- Eventual supernova.

59:49.500 --> 59:52.470
Sounds good. Let's vaporize it.

59:54.125 --> 59:56.969
Bomb bay systems operational.

01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:18.466
Lock fail safe.

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:22.758
Fail safe in lock.
We have...

01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:25.382
8 minutes until drop.

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:28.837
24 minutes to detonation.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:33.468
This is Sergeant Pinback
calling Bomb #20.

01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:34.926
You read me, bomb?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.048
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback.

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:39.503
Roger, I read you, continue.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.459
You are now in the
Emergency Air Lock.

01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:47.842
Please remember that in
an emergency situation,

01:00:47.917 --> 01:00:50.511
the Surface Door can
be opened instantly

01:00:50.583 --> 01:00:53.382
without prior depressurization,

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:57.543
so be sure to wear your
star suit at all times.

01:00:57.875 --> 01:01:02.381
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

01:01:45.875 --> 01:01:48.003
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle?

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:49.380
Sir?

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:50.926
Sh, Talby, don't bother me.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.094
But I think this is important, Sir.

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:55.215
I think I found the malfunction.

01:01:55.292 --> 01:01:57.135
I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.551
Not now!

01:01:58.625 --> 01:02:01.549
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock
and the hatch is...

01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:03.753
4 minutes until drop, Bomb...

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:06.552
have you checked your platinum
euridium energy shielding?

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:08.969
Energy shielding positive function.

01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:12.842
- Remember detonation time?
- Detonation in 20 minutes.

01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:15.636
Alright, that checks out here.

01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:18.837
Okay, bomb, arm yourself.

01:02:18.917 --> 01:02:20.294
Armed.

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.843
Hello?

01:02:21.917 --> 01:02:23.635
Lieutenant Doolittle? Hello!

01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:26.678
Hello? Can you read me?!

01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:32.512
Communications Laser #17,

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:35.587
monitoring the bomb drop mechanism,

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:40.298
has now been activated and will
switch into a test mode.

01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:42.590
If you will look near
the Surface Door,

01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:47.798
you will see that the Parallax
Receptor Cell has been engaged.

01:02:48.667 --> 01:02:50.715
The laser will now energize.

01:02:50.792 --> 01:02:54.717
Please stand clear of the
path of the beam.

01:02:54.792 --> 01:03:00.253
Communications Laser #17
is now on test.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:04.338
Under no circumstances enter
the path of the beams.

01:03:04.458 --> 01:03:07.086
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:10.757
Well then, everything sounds fine.

01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:13.586
Dropping you off in 75 seconds.
Good luck.

01:03:13.667 --> 01:03:14.714
Thanks.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:18.501
I've got a quantum reading of 35-er.
3-5-er.

01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:20.960
I read the same here.

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:25.964
Doolittle. Doolittle?

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:28.256
I don't know if you can hear me.

01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:30.677
But I'm going to try to adjust
the cue switch in the laser.

01:03:34.792 --> 01:03:38.467
Well... here it goes...

01:03:55.792 --> 01:03:59.422
Oh my god, my eyes!
I can't see!

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.093
Attention. Attention.

01:04:01.167 --> 01:04:03.670
- The laser has malfunctioned.
- My eyes!!

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.754
Under no circumstances
enter the path of the beams.

01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:09.803
To do so will cause immediate...

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:20.133
Begin primary sequence.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:29.925
Mark at 10-9-8-7-6-

01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:37.376
5-4-3-2-1-drop.

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:40.758
Negative drop.

01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:42.756
It's just sittin' there
in the bomb bay.

01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:44.801
Try it again, Pinback.

01:04:51.792 --> 01:04:58.300
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.

01:04:59.792 --> 01:05:02.295
Negative drop!

01:05:05.792 --> 01:05:08.261
Rechannel all safety relays!

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:10.756
- Open quantum latches!
- Open circuit breakers!

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:13.757
- Remove thrust drive repellent!
- Automatic channels open!

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:16.757
75-15 Going to operation position!

01:05:16.833 --> 01:05:18.380
Remark.

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:25.421
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-
drop... drop! ...Drop!!!

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:32.505
Sittin' there.
The damn thing's just sittin' there.

01:05:43.292 --> 01:05:46.091
This is Lieutenant Doolittle
Calling Bomb #20.

01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:48.761
I repeat previous order,
you are to disarm yourself and

01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:51.211
return to the bomb bay immediately!
Do you understand?

01:05:51.292 --> 01:05:55.092
I am programmed to detonate in
14 minutes 30 seconds.

01:05:55.167 --> 01:05:57.761
Detonation will occur at the
programmed time.

01:05:57.833 --> 01:05:59.756
What!? This is Doolittle.

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:03.758
You are not to detonate, repeat, you
are not to detonate in the bomb bay.

01:06:03.833 --> 01:06:06.586
Disarm yourself. This is an order.

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:08.089
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle,

01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:10.716
but I am programmed
to detonate in 14 minutes.

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:13.466
Detonation will occur at
the programmed time.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.753
14 minutes to detonation.

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:21.427
Attention. Attention.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.424
I have sustained serious damage.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.468
Please pay close attention.

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:29.423
The bomb has malfunctioned.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.253
I have activated automatic dampers,

01:06:32.333 --> 01:06:37.134
which will confine the explosion to
an area one mile in diameter.

01:06:37.208 --> 01:06:39.552
This is all I can do at this time.

01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:42.629
It's up to you now.

01:06:52.958 --> 01:06:56.132
There's only one thing I can do.

01:06:56.292 --> 01:06:59.091
I have to ask Commander Powell.

01:06:59.167 --> 01:07:01.636
I have to ask him what to do.

01:08:06.792 --> 01:08:08.590
Commander Powell?

01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:11.750
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.
Can you read me?

01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:15.542
(Muffled sounds)

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.752
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:21.756
Something serious has come up,
I have to ask you a question.

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:25.633
I'm glad you've come to talk
With me, Doolittle.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.584
It's been so long since anyone
has come to talk with me.

01:08:29.667 --> 01:08:32.090
Commander, sir, we have
a big problem.

01:08:32.167 --> 01:08:34.761
The uh, Veil Nebula bomb,
Bomb Number 20, it's uh,

01:08:34.832 --> 01:08:37.426
It's stuck.
It won't drop out of the bomb bay.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.252
It refuses to listen and it.

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.926
It plans on detonating in...

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.252
less than eleven minutes.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:47.917
Doolittle,
you must tell me one thing.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.173
What's that, sir?

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:52.586
Tell me, Doolittle,

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:56.001
How are the Dodgers doing?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.923
Well, the Dodgers uh...

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.584
They broke up, they disbanded
over 15 years ago!

01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:08.594
- Ah... pity, pity...
- But you don't understand, sir!

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:11.261
We can't get the bomb to drop.

01:09:11.332 --> 01:09:14.587
Ah, so many malfunctions...

01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:18.921
Why don't you have anything nice
to tell me when you activate me?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.925
Oh well, ...did you try
the azimuth clutch?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.924
Yes sir. Negative effect.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.082
- What was that, Doolittle?
- Negative effect!

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:31.920
- It didn't work?
- That's correct, sir.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.923
Sony, Doolittle.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.924
I've forgotten so much
since I've been in here.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.593
So much.

01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:42.251
What should we do, sir?
The time is running out!

01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:46.462
Well, what you might try is.

01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:48.465
Commander? Hello... Comman...

01:09:49.167 --> 01:09:50.919
Commander Powell?! Hello!>

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.923
Doolittle?... Hello?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.128
Sorry, sir, you faded out there
for a little while.

01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:56.300
Sorry.

01:09:56.375 --> 01:09:58.673
What was that you were
saying about the bomb?

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:05.338
Ah... it seems to me...
Sony, I've drawn a blank.

01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:08.420
Hold if.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.174
I'll have it again in just a minute.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.586
I forget so many things in here,
so many things.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:21.503
Hold on, just a minute,
let me think...

01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:26.336
But you can't explode
in the bomb bay.

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:28.340
It's foolish.
You'll kill us all.

01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:30.010
There's no reason for it.

01:10:30.083 --> 01:10:32.677
I am programmed to detonate
in 9 minutes.

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:35.594
Detonation will occur at
the programmed time.

01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:37.669
Would you consider another course
of action?

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.798
For example, just waiting around
awhile so we can disarm you?

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:40.922
No.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.344
I can tell, that damn thing
Just doesn't understand.

01:10:43.417 --> 01:10:44.839
Look, bomb!...

01:10:44.917 --> 01:10:47.841
Commander, Sir? You still there?

01:10:47.917 --> 01:10:51.842
Oh, yes, Doolittle,
I'm thinking.

01:10:51.917 --> 01:10:54.511
We're running out of time, sir.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:11:00.511
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle,
if you can't get it to drop

01:11:00.583 --> 01:11:03.336
- you'll have to talk to it.
- Sir?

01:11:03.417 --> 01:11:06.341
- Talk to the bomb.
- But I have been talking to it, sir!

01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:08.465
And Pinback's talking
to it right now!

01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:12.501
No, no, Doolittle,
you talk to it.

01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:17.009
Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.

01:11:17.083 --> 01:11:18.380
Sir?

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:21.512
Phenomenology...

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:25.383
Doolittle!
6 minutes to detonation!

01:11:25.458 --> 01:11:27.051
Doolittle!

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:44.376
Doolittle! Doolittle,
what the hell are you doing?!

01:12:12.042 --> 01:12:15.501
Hello, bomb, are you with me?

01:12:15.583 --> 01:12:16.835
Of course.

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:19.466
Are you willing to entertain
a few concepts?

01:12:19.542 --> 01:12:21.465
I am always receptive to suggestions.

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:24.512
Fine. Think about this one, then:

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:27.883
How do you know you exist?

01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:34.001
What the hell is he doin'?

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.177
I think he's talking to it.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.002
Well of course I exist.

01:12:38.083 --> 01:12:39.835
But how do you know you exist?

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:43.501
- It is intuitively obvious.
- Intuition is no proof.

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:46.837
What concrete evidence do you
have that you exist?

01:12:46.917 --> 01:12:49.011
Hmm...

01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:53.509
Well, I think, therefore I am.

01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:55.836
That's good.
That's very good.

01:12:55.917 --> 01:12:58.841
But how do you know that
anything else exists?

01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:02.501
- My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
- Ah, Right!

01:13:02.583 --> 01:13:03.835
This is fun.

01:13:03.917 --> 01:13:07.342
Now, listen, listen...
here's the big question.

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:08.509
How do you know... that the

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:14.545
evidence your sensory apparatus
reveals to you is correct?

01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:21.885
- The gun!
- Gun?! Gun?

01:13:22.042 --> 01:13:23.840
The support pins on the bomb!

01:13:23.917 --> 01:13:25.590
- Shoot the pins off!
- No, Boiler, you're out of your mind!

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.340
We can stop the bomb!
Get out of my way, you idiot!

01:13:27.417 --> 01:13:30.011
I can shoot the support pins out and the
bomb will fall away from the ship!

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:32.177
Get out of my way or
I'll kick your teeth in!

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:34.173
I can shoot those pins out and
it will fall away from the ship!

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:36.878
Get out the way!
I can save the ship!

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:40.002
Don't do it, Boiler!
You're a bad shot!

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:42.336
You'll hit the bomb!
Doolittle's talkin' to the bomb.

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.886
You're a bad shot! He'll save us,
you can't do that!

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:47.798
What I'm getting at is this:

01:13:47.875 --> 01:13:52.301
The only experience that is directly
available to you is your sensory data.

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:56.676
And this sensory data is merely
A stream of electrical impulses which

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:59.173
stimulate your computing center.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:01.344
In other words, all I really know
about the outside world

01:14:01.417 --> 01:14:03.840
is relayed to me through
my electrical connections.

01:14:03.917 --> 01:14:05.385
Exactly.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:09.212
Why, ...that would mean that...

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:12.337
I really don't know what the outside
universe is like at all, for certain.

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:13.839
That's it! That's it!

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.169
Intriguing.

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.050
I wish I had more time
to discuss this matter.

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.718
Why don't you have more time?

01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:20.886
Because I must detonate in 75 seconds.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:23.336
No, no, now, put it back!
Put the gun back!

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:25.511
You don't know what you are doing!

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:30.718
Now, now give me the gun!

01:14:30.792 --> 01:14:32.752
You fool! I'm gonna shoot
the pins out of the bomb

01:14:32.792 --> 01:14:34.715
and it will fall away from the ship
and we'll be saved!

01:14:34.792 --> 01:14:37.762
Give me the gun, you don't know what
you are doing? You're...

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:41.753
You could have killed me...

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:43.376
Now bomb,

01:14:43.458 --> 01:14:47.213
consider this next question,
very carefully.

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:51.377
- What is your one purpose in life?
- To explode, of course.

01:14:51.458 --> 01:14:54.541
- And you can only do it once, right?
- That is correct.

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:57.549
And you wouldn't want to explode on
the basis of false data, would you?

01:14:57.625 --> 01:14:58.717
Of course not.

01:14:58.792 --> 01:15:02.376
Well then, you've already admitted
that you have no real proof of

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:05.541
- the existence of the outside universe.
- Yes, well...

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:09.880
So you have no absolute proof that
Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:12.882
I recall distinctly the detonation order.

01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:14.881
My memory is good on
matters like these.

01:15:14.958 --> 01:15:16.710
Yes, of course you remember it, but...

01:15:16.792 --> 01:15:19.545
But all you're remembering is merely a
series of electrical impulses which

01:15:19.625 --> 01:15:24.210
you now realize have no real definite
connection with, with outside reality.

01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:27.216
True, but since this is so,
I have no proof that you are

01:15:27.292 --> 01:15:29.044
really telling me all this.

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.218
That's all beside the point.

01:15:36.292 --> 01:15:38.652
I mean, the concept is valid,
no matter where it originates.

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:39.709
Hmmm...

01:15:39.792 --> 01:15:41.385
- So if you detonate in...
- 9 seconds.

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:44.382
You could be doing so
on the basis of false data.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:45.880
I have no proof that it was false data.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.928
You have no proof that
it was correct data.

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:55.926
I must think on this further.

01:16:01.917 --> 01:16:04.386
Attention. Attention.

01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:07.052
The bomb has returned
to the bomb bay.

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:10.425
The destruction sequence is aborted.

01:16:34.083 --> 01:16:38.042
Doolittle? Doolittle?

01:16:38.125 --> 01:16:41.550
What happened?
Pinback? Boiler?

01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:45.084
Did we blow it up?
Hello? Hello?

01:16:55.125 --> 01:16:58.550
Hello, anybody!
Did we blow up the planet?

01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:02.584
Hello, hello!
What's going on?

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:08.584
You know, we've really gotta
disarm the bomb.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:16.053
Hello, Doolittle, are you there?

01:17:16.125 --> 01:17:17.547
I'm coming in now.

01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:20.048
I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock.

01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:22.719
Too much trouble to come
in the Dorsal Lock.

01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:25.716
Would you blow the seal on the
emergency hatch so I can come in?

01:17:25.792 --> 01:17:27.760
Oh, sure.

01:17:29.792 --> 01:17:32.420
You are now leaving the
Emergency Airlock.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.844
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:39.793
Hello, Pinback?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.503
- What's up, Doolittle?
- Talby was in the air lock.

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:47.550
You blew him out of the ship.
He's drifting away without a jet pack.

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:49.002
I'm going after him.

01:17:49.083 --> 01:17:51.711
Turn on his helmet radio
so I can contact him.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.385
What? What's wrong? I didn't hear...

01:17:53.458 --> 01:17:56.587
Uh, Talby. He's drifting away from
the ship without his jet pack.

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:04.043
Talby,

01:18:04.125 --> 01:18:06.048
Talby, can you read me?

01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:09.049
Can you beat that?
I always knew that guy was weird.

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:11.048
Talby, can you read me?

01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:14.254
Help, Doolittle, help me!

01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:25.257
All right, bomb,

01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:28.553
- Prepare to receive new orders.
- You are false data.

01:18:28.625 --> 01:18:31.549
- Huh?
- Therefore, I shall ignore you.

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:33.548
Hello, bomb.

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:36.219
False data can act only
as a distraction.

01:18:36.292 --> 01:18:38.215
Therefore I shall refuse
to perceive you.

01:18:38.292 --> 01:18:39.714
Hey, bomb...

01:18:39.792 --> 01:18:41.715
The only thing which
exists is myself

01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:46.047
- Doolittle! Help me.
- Calm down. I'm coming.

01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:49.051
Snap out of it, bomb.

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:52.049
In the beginning there was darkness,
And the darkness was without form

01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:53.877
and void.

01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:56.882
- Uh, you-hoo bomb.
- What the hell is he talking about?

01:18:56.958 --> 01:19:01.008
And in addition to the darkness
there was also me.

01:19:01.083 --> 01:19:04.383
And I moved upon
the face of the darkness.

01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:06.711
And I saw that I was alone.

01:19:06.792 --> 01:19:11.002
Hey... bomb'?...

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:15.088
Let there be light.

01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:31.053
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:34.049
Here I am. I'm spinning...

01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:38.050
We're both falling in opposite
directions, away from each other.

01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:39.377
What happened, Doolittle?

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:41.677
The bomb must have
gone off inside the ship.

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:43.718
The ship blew up? What?!

01:19:43.833 --> 01:19:47.087
Funny, I thought I had the
damn thing convinced.

01:19:47.208 --> 01:19:51.839
- Then Boiler... and Pinback?
- They're dead, Talby.

01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:57.052
- Then we're dead, too.
- Maybe not... maybe there's a way.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:20:01.631
Hey, hey my jet pack’s busted.

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:03.676
Aw, man...

01:20:03.792 --> 01:20:08.719
Hey, ...it looks like the skipper.
He made it.

01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:11.378
Commander Powell made it!

01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:15.759
Men... men... what happened, men?

01:20:15.833 --> 01:20:18.757
Ya, the skipper always was lucky.

01:20:19.125 --> 01:20:21.844
Talby, looks like I'm headed
for the planet.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.510
I'm going right toward it.

01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:28.423
When you hit the atmosphere,
you'll start to burn.

01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:33.042
What a beautiful way to die...
as a falling star.

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:36.584
Guess you're right.

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:43.549
Doolittle, I'm heading right
toward something.

01:20:43.625 --> 01:20:49.086
It's behind me, in the distance.
Something that glows.

01:20:49.917 --> 01:20:52.887
Doolittle...
I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!

01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:54.050
Phoenix?

01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:57.709
- It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix!
- No kidding?

01:20:57.792 --> 01:21:02.218
I'm going into them!
I'm going to hit them.

01:21:02.292 --> 01:21:04.044
- Doolittle...
- Ya?

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:07.709
Before we get too far apart,
and our signals start fading,

01:21:07.792 --> 01:21:12.047
I just wanted to tell you...
you were my favorite.

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:15.049
I really liked you, Doolittle.

01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:18.711
I really liked you too, Talley.

01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:23.047
Hey, some debris from the ship!
It's coming right by me.

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:26.379
Doolittle, I'm going into them.

01:21:26.458 --> 01:21:28.381
I'm beginning to glow.

01:21:28.458 --> 01:21:32.383
They're taking me with them,
with the Phoenix...

01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:35.667
I'll circle the universe... forever.

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.048
I'm with them now...

01:21:39.125 --> 01:21:42.049
be back this way again some day.

01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:46.551
Doolittle, before it's too late,

01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:50.425
there's one last thing
I just want to tell you...

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:55.084
Talby?

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:15.048
Hey... Talby!

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:17.048
I've got a piece of debris!

01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:20.504
And I think I've figured out a way!
