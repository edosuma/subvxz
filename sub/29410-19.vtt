00:03.264 --> 00:05.614
â™ª

00:15.102 --> 00:16.929
EVE:
It's why I have to go.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.976
This isn't your search anymore.

00:22.892 --> 00:25.416
AINSLEY:
Hello? Mom?

00:25.460 --> 00:27.244
Oh.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.246
No sign of her yet.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.596
Guess I'm not
as late as I thought.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.902
I'm on my second cup.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.947
-Sorry.
-[door opens]

00:34.991 --> 00:37.602
Malcolm.

00:37.646 --> 00:40.040
I thought I smelled coffee.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.781
-Good morning.
-And you must be Ainsley.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.696
My pleasure.

00:47.090 --> 00:50.441
I hope you can keep this off
the record. I'm Nicholas...

00:50.485 --> 00:52.095
Endicott.
I know.

00:52.139 --> 00:55.229
Sorry to be intruding.

00:55.272 --> 00:58.884
It's your mother's fault for
making such a damn good martini.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.582
Don't tell her
I crashed your party.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.975
I promised I'd be discreet.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.325
Mmm.

01:04.368 --> 01:06.022
Good coffee.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.809
[door opens]

01:10.853 --> 01:12.594
Way to go, Mom?

01:12.637 --> 01:15.553
I don't know.
I have done a lot of reading

01:15.597 --> 01:18.121
on Endicott Pharmaceuticals,
and honestly,

01:18.165 --> 01:19.731
they seem kind of shady.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.820
I mean, Dad used to do
research for them,

01:21.864 --> 01:25.085
and I'm pretty sure
he just gave me a once-over.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.260
[chuckles softly]

01:26.303 --> 01:28.088
Ainsley Whitly,
ever the romantic.

01:28.131 --> 01:31.091
Speaking of, how's Eve?

01:31.134 --> 01:33.745
She finally reached out
a couple weeks ago.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.486
And?
Did she apologize?

01:36.661 --> 01:38.620
Actually, she broke up with me.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.143
Via voice mail.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.014
[exhales]

01:42.058 --> 01:44.147
Turns out people
can still surprise you.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.845
All right.
Let's hear it.

01:46.889 --> 01:49.761
Ains, I'm not gonna
play my breakup for you.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.763
Well, you might have
misinterpreted.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.548
You know, women are from Venus
and all that.

01:53.591 --> 01:54.853
Let-let me hear it.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.159
Come on.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.552
Please?

02:04.298 --> 02:06.952
EVE:
Hey. I just...

02:06.996 --> 02:09.520
I wanted to say I'm sorry

02:09.564 --> 02:11.479
to leave you
and end things this way.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.959
But I have to do this
on my own.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.874
Please don't come
after me, okay?

02:15.918 --> 02:17.876
Take care of yourself, Malcolm.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.401
You deserve to be happy.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.491
Yeah, that was super clear.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.798
I'm sorry.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.278
I know it hurts.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.498
It's okay.
It really doesn't.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.543
-I'm fine.
-[phone dings]

02:34.154 --> 02:35.329
Gil.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.374
There's an emergency
at the precinct.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.376
-Give Mother my love.
-Nope. Nope, nope.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.291
Malcolm, do not
leave me stra... Malcolm!

02:44.251 --> 02:46.209
[indistinct whispering]

02:59.396 --> 03:01.398
What's going on?

03:08.623 --> 03:10.407
It's Eve.

03:10.451 --> 03:13.976
Oh. Wow.
News travels fast.

03:14.019 --> 03:16.587
Yeah, she broke up with me,
but I'm fine.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.117
Eve's dead.

03:25.161 --> 03:27.119
What?

03:27.163 --> 03:29.209
Suicide.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.516
[chuckles]:
No.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.692
Unis found her this morning
in the Hudson.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.478
Edrisa's examining her now.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.654
Kid, I am so sorry.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.572
Bright? Bright.

03:48.837 --> 03:51.970
Bloat is consistent
with prolonged exposure.

03:52.014 --> 03:55.147
Severe maceration
of the hand and feet.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.759
Foam at the mouth and nostrils

03:57.802 --> 04:00.979
appears antemortem.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.633
Hello, Edrisa.

04:02.677 --> 04:06.246
Bright?
I wasn't expecting the...

04:07.943 --> 04:10.772
Did you eat? I have half
a slamming breakfast burrito.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.077
No cheese, extra pico.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.775
I couldn't choke
the whole thing down.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.429
[sniffles, chuckles softly]

04:15.472 --> 04:17.779
I don't have
much of an appetite.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.912
Right.
So, what's up?

04:20.956 --> 04:24.612
I-I don't have anything for you.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.876
I... Ugh, I mean, you know,
she's just a floater.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.095
They pulled her
from the Hudson last night.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.272
It's pretty gnarly.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.930
Her name's Eve Blanchard.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.193
Oh, y...
Oh, you know her.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.806
I'm sorr...
Uh, Bright,

04:44.849 --> 04:47.330
-I'm so sorry.
-Please.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.549
Tell me what you know.

04:48.592 --> 04:51.029
Right.
Um...

04:51.073 --> 04:53.336
Well, I can tell from

04:53.380 --> 04:55.469
my initial examination

04:55.512 --> 04:58.210
that Eve has been dead for,

04:58.254 --> 05:00.300
um, approximately two weeks.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.869
She never even
made it out of town.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.871
Eve's death wasn't a suicide,

05:06.915 --> 05:08.656
it was a murder,
and I want on the case.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.049
Look, she had a dark past...

05:11.093 --> 05:12.312
-I have a dark past.
-JT: We talked to Homicide.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.922
They're calling it a suicide.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.315
Said Eve had a history
of depression,

05:15.358 --> 05:17.447
-that she's medicated...
-I'm medicated.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.144
Again, irrelevant.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.321
Eve died two weeks ago.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.975
Right after she found out
her sister was still alive.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.891
She wasn't depressed,
she was motivated.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.240
Driven to find her.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.938
I know what you're gonna say,

05:29.981 --> 05:32.462
that I'm too close to this
and I can't be objective...

05:32.506 --> 05:34.986
-All true.
-but I'm not gonna
let you bench me.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.684
Not this time.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.352
Dig in.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.529
Do what you got to do.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.531
But first...

05:57.574 --> 06:00.185
someone's got to
tell your mother.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.371
NICHOLAS:
Of course, as parents,
our first instinct

06:11.414 --> 06:13.416
is to protect our children.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.376
But you're suffering
just as much as Malcolm.

06:16.419 --> 06:19.379
You have to remember to make
space for your own grief.

06:20.684 --> 06:21.946
[exhales, sniffles]

06:21.990 --> 06:23.295
JESSICA:
Malcolm.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.123
Eve's office just called.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.995
I'm so sorry.

06:27.038 --> 06:30.215
Malcolm, you have
my deepest condolences.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.782
Thank you.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.784
Jessica tells me
your friend's death

06:33.828 --> 06:36.134
-was ruled a suicide.
-[sighs]

06:36.178 --> 06:38.093
The police are still
investigating.

06:38.136 --> 06:41.052
I'm sorry.
It's a needless tragedy.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.054
But I should be going.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.230
This is a time for family.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.755
-Take care of yourself.
-Mm.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.503
[door opens]

06:56.546 --> 06:58.330
Nicholas was with you
when you got the call?

06:58.374 --> 06:59.593
[door closes]

06:59.636 --> 07:00.855
He was.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.422
[exhales]

07:02.465 --> 07:04.772
I just wish
that Eve had reached out

07:04.815 --> 07:07.383
-to one of us...
-Eve was murdered.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.993
What?

07:09.037 --> 07:10.865
-Her office told me...
-They told you it was a suicide

07:10.908 --> 07:13.084
because that's what the killer
wanted us to believe.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.565
Dad warned me.

07:15.609 --> 07:19.569
And I think he knew who it was.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.267
Well, then, we have no choice
but to demand the truth.

07:22.311 --> 07:23.660
I'll have Dolpho
bring the car around.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.183
He'll never tell us.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.969
Oh, never bet against
your mother, darling.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.797
Your father's just a man.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.581
Grab him where it counts
and he'll squeal like a pig.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.902
-Ainsley?
-Mom...

07:47.945 --> 07:49.991
-Why are you here?
-[latch clicks]

07:51.035 --> 07:52.210
What is this?

07:52.254 --> 07:54.386
Well, isn't that obvious?

07:55.692 --> 07:57.694
It's a family reunion.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.183
Oh, we should celebrate.

08:08.226 --> 08:10.968
You know, the canteen sells
a very festive Cajun snack mix.

08:11.012 --> 08:14.058
[shouting]: Eddie, could you
grab us a few bags to nosh on?

08:14.102 --> 08:16.234
A-And get something
for yourself.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.932
I hope he heard that.

08:17.975 --> 08:21.413
My, uh, new friend has a touch
of wrestler's ear.

08:21.457 --> 08:24.112
If he comes back
with cheddar or ranch,

08:24.155 --> 08:25.417
just be cool about it.

08:26.897 --> 08:29.552
I uncovered some information

08:29.596 --> 08:30.858
on the girl in the box.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.253
Sophie Sanders worked
for Nicholas Endicott.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.431
What? No.

08:39.475 --> 08:40.824
No, that can't be true.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.261
Nicholas had absolutely nothing
to do with this.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.741
He is a good man.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.265
There's only one monster
in this story.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.530
You made a deal with Sophie.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.274
She had information,
dirt on someone.

08:56.318 --> 08:57.972
That's why you let her live.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.670
That information was on Nicholas
Endicott, wasn't it, Dad?

09:02.498 --> 09:05.762
He's the reason Dad got
the plea deal of the century.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.198
[Jessica scoffs]

09:07.242 --> 09:08.809
JESSICA:
No, that can't be true.

09:08.852 --> 09:12.377
Mom, this isn't a coincidence.

09:12.421 --> 09:15.337
Wait, why are you two here?

09:16.381 --> 09:19.123
Eve Blanchard was murdered.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.387
MARTIN:
My boy.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.085
Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:24.128 --> 09:27.088
Oh, she was
such a spirited girl.

09:27.131 --> 09:30.352
A real match
for your vigor, but...

09:30.395 --> 09:31.745
I did warn her.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.616
Why?

09:33.660 --> 09:36.227
Why did you want to stop Eve
from searching for her sister?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.839
I don-I don't think we should

09:38.882 --> 09:40.188
discuss this
in front of your mother.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.712
She's upset,
and understandably so.

09:42.756 --> 09:46.586
Let's leave the past
in the past.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.631
Focus on us.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.980
Our family.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.854
We are not your family.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.595
We are just a group of people

09:55.638 --> 09:58.162
tragically bound to you
by blood.

09:58.206 --> 10:01.209
Your children want answers.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.255
Talk!

10:04.299 --> 10:07.476
Or there will be
no more family reunions.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.999
With any of us.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.925
The kids are right
about Nicholas.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.014
I will tell you

10:24.058 --> 10:26.495
what Sophie told me,

10:26.538 --> 10:27.627
for your own good.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.717
To save you from the same fate

10:30.760 --> 10:32.980
that befell our poor Eve.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.463
Sophie told me...

10:38.507 --> 10:40.291
You can never say no to him.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.553
MARTIN: "Never

10:41.597 --> 10:42.946
tell him no."

10:42.990 --> 10:44.818
That's Nicholas Endicott's
one rule.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.038
Oh, he plucked Sophie
off the street,

10:48.082 --> 10:51.389
gave her a job,
turned her life around,

10:51.433 --> 10:53.609
and all she had to do

10:53.653 --> 10:55.176
was say yes.

10:55.219 --> 10:59.049
Nicholas' empire
is built on cruelty.

10:59.093 --> 11:02.705
And he saved his truly

11:02.749 --> 11:06.143
despicable requests for Sophie.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.755
I did everything he asked.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.105
I knew if I didn't...

11:11.148 --> 11:13.324
I'd be next.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.936
It takes a special
kind of monster

11:15.979 --> 11:17.764
to turn someone else into one.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.421
You're lying.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.510
Sorry, Jess.

11:25.554 --> 11:28.296
Another romantic
swing and a miss for you.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.733
[exhales]

11:30.777 --> 11:32.779
Please tell me he's lying.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.043
I can't.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.610
The profile makes sense.

11:38.654 --> 11:41.048
Nicholas Endicott
is a genetic narcissist.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.745
A born sociopath.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.747
But Eve must have
gotten too close.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.140
Please stop.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.750
I don't want to hear
any more about this.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.752
A sociopath
who no one ever said no to.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.886
And a man we will
all stay away from.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.452
-I said stop.
-Fine with me.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.758
Should we play
highlights/lowlights?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.064
Oh, you loved that

11:57.107 --> 11:58.065
when you were kids.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.240
I'm sorry.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.328
I know this is a shock.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.459
But if Nicholas killed Eve...

12:01.503 --> 12:02.939
MARTIN:
Uh, one quibble there.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.854
He would never have
done that himself.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.161
Remember, murder's just

12:07.204 --> 12:10.077
another business transaction--
a task for a loyal employee.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.469
A contract killer.

12:11.513 --> 12:12.601
I'll find him.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.777
Force him to flip on Endicott.

12:14.821 --> 12:15.865
Flip on Endicott?

12:15.909 --> 12:17.475
Did you hear what I said?

12:17.519 --> 12:19.651
-He will destroy us all.
-[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

12:19.695 --> 12:20.870
Goodbye, Dr. Whitly.

12:20.914 --> 12:21.915
Malcolm...

12:21.958 --> 12:23.438
I forbid you from continuing

12:23.481 --> 12:25.005
this investigation.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.223
Malcolm Whitly,

12:26.267 --> 12:28.138
I am still your father!

12:28.182 --> 12:29.618
JESSICA:
Well...

12:29.661 --> 12:31.402
I'd say that was a lowlight.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.100
You slept with him, didn't you?

12:35.711 --> 12:37.800
Good thing you never say no.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.193
[scoffs]

12:51.248 --> 12:53.250
I've completed Eve's autopsy.

13:00.692 --> 13:01.868
Cause of death?

13:01.911 --> 13:03.695
She drowned.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.089
And there are
injuries consistent

13:06.133 --> 13:08.135
with hitting the water
from a significant height.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.708
But it wasn't a suicide.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.841
Drowning is a diagnosis
of exclusion,

13:18.885 --> 13:20.669
meaning I've ruled out
literally every other

13:20.712 --> 13:22.889
possible cause of death.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.369
So most pathologists would have
toed the company line

13:25.413 --> 13:27.502
and ruled it a suicide.

13:27.545 --> 13:28.546
The company line?

13:28.590 --> 13:29.547
I got a call from

13:29.591 --> 13:30.548
the commissioner's office.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.028
They were wondering why

13:32.072 --> 13:33.856
I haven't made my determination.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.553
That's Endicott at work.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.686
What did you tell them?

13:37.729 --> 13:39.166
Don't worry, I am not like

13:39.209 --> 13:40.907
most pathologists.
[short chuckle]

13:40.950 --> 13:41.908
That's for sure.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.823
When a person inhales water,

13:43.866 --> 13:46.869
diatoms--
a kind of microalgae--

13:46.913 --> 13:49.089
enters into the lungs,
then circulates

13:49.132 --> 13:50.655
through the organs.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.571
I extracted the diatoms
from Eve's bone marrow,

13:53.615 --> 13:55.791
examined them,
revealing a slightly

13:55.835 --> 13:57.358
different level of chlorophyll

13:57.401 --> 13:59.186
than in the sample
water from the river.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.363
-Meaning?
-Someone drowned her.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.321
And then threw her
off that bridge.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.933
Bright...

14:06.976 --> 14:10.023
Our first profile
is straightforward.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.852
Nicholas Endicott
is the sociopath puppet master.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.071
He's already proven he can
pull strings at the NYPD.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.465
We have no way of knowing
how far his reach extends.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.989
He's the killer
who doesn't kill.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.905
Eve's murderer is different.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.385
We're looking for an assassin.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.300
They're almost
impossible to profile.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.258
So...

14:28.302 --> 14:29.694
I don't have one.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.566
EDRISA:
Oh.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.133
Bummer.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.004
If I have a blind spot...

14:35.048 --> 14:36.832
this is it.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.227
I might know a guy.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.622
â™ª Fly me to the moonâ™ª

14:44.666 --> 14:45.928
â™ª Let me playâ™ª

14:45.972 --> 14:49.192
â™ª Among the stars...â™ª

14:49.236 --> 14:51.064
Espresso, please.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.631
â™ª Spring is like on...â™ª

14:53.675 --> 14:56.069
How's the family, Ciro?

14:56.112 --> 14:58.071
â™ª In other words...â™ª

14:58.114 --> 15:00.725
16 grandchildren now.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.205
Shall I pull out the pictures?

15:04.512 --> 15:06.122
That's what I thought.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.430
â™ª In other words,
baby, kiss me...â™ª

15:09.473 --> 15:11.475
I need information.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.999
On a pro? [chuckles]

15:13.042 --> 15:15.349
Why bother?
You're never gonna catch him.

15:15.392 --> 15:18.395
Just like you never caught me.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.788
Indulge me.

15:19.831 --> 15:20.963
Gil...

15:21.007 --> 15:22.878
the arthritis...

15:22.922 --> 15:25.011
makes it so tough
to pull a trigger.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.931
The Five Families must have
been sad to see you go.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.498
You, uh, bring a friend?

15:34.542 --> 15:36.196
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.676
Nice coat.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.114
But it's in the wrong borough.

15:41.157 --> 15:44.117
I can smell a fed a mile away.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.598
Hey, tell the Bureau
what I told Arroyo here.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.383
I've closed up shop.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.647
The field office
is a busy place.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.388
There's only
so many bomb threats

15:54.431 --> 15:56.042
we can comb through in a day.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.827
But I'd be happy to put
your name back in the hopper.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.351
Or you could give
my colleague here

16:01.395 --> 16:02.962
the information he needs.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.704
Who was it?

16:06.748 --> 16:08.663
A woman.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.621
Eve Blanchard.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.493
-Nice girl.
-That's a shame,

16:12.536 --> 16:13.885
killing a woman.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.626
Special place in hell for that.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.714
Save it, Ciro.

16:16.758 --> 16:17.846
We both know assassins

16:17.889 --> 16:19.456
try to avoid overlap.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.546
Too many active hits in the same
city at the same time.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.722
What we need to know

16:24.766 --> 16:26.942
is who's been working New York.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.340
CIRO:
They call her The Nightingale.

16:35.951 --> 16:39.215
BRIGHT:
Ciro said she's
possibly in her mid-30s.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.912
-JT: Any other description?
-No.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.219
She's famously skilled
at concealing her identity.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.612
Oh, cool. Should be easy then.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.092
Yeah, but we're not
looking for her.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.572
We're looking
for her next target.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.532
The big data whistleblower,
Conrad Hulce,

16:51.575 --> 16:55.101
has a ticket on the 234 to D.C.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.672
Bar charging station,
poppy seed.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.675
Way too much cream cheese.

17:04.719 --> 17:08.375
Okay, let's keep our distance.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.420
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

17:22.476 --> 17:24.956
The Nightingale's here.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.567
Might not go down today,

17:26.610 --> 17:28.482
but she's watching him.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.571
I can feel it.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.486
JT [over radio]:
Bright, there are

17:32.529 --> 17:34.096
hundreds of women in this place.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.576
BRIGHT:
You're right.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.099
I'm working without a profile.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.406
Any one of them
could be the assassin.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.326
There's no way to get
the drop on her.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.371
We need to draw her out.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.120
When the commotion starts,

17:58.164 --> 18:00.122
one woman will remain
perfectly calm.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.254
What commotion?

18:01.297 --> 18:02.429
Find her.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.952
I'll take care of the rest.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.432
JT:
Bright?

18:05.475 --> 18:06.955
Bright.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.261
What commotion?

18:08.304 --> 18:09.610
What the hell's he doing?

18:10.915 --> 18:12.265
JT:
Bright.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.309
Come in, Bright.

18:13.353 --> 18:14.876
Bright, come in, Bright.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.574
Conrad Hulce!

18:18.662 --> 18:19.663
Is that you?

18:22.362 --> 18:24.277
-[crowd clamoring]
-WOMAN: A knife!

18:24.320 --> 18:25.843
MAN:
He just-just got stabbed!

18:25.887 --> 18:27.932
[grunts]

18:31.414 --> 18:32.937
[people shouting]

18:35.505 --> 18:37.942
-[yells, grunts]
-MAN: Come on, let's go!

18:37.986 --> 18:40.031
[people screaming]

18:40.075 --> 18:41.859
Squad Central, this is Tarmel.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.078
We need a bus.

18:45.646 --> 18:46.647
Fall to the ground.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.779
I'm gonna save your life.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.436
It's ketchup.
Start screaming.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.438
[grunts]

18:55.482 --> 18:57.745
[groaning]

19:03.533 --> 19:07.102
You definitely know
how to cause some commotion.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.060
WOMAN:
Just get out of here. Go, go!

19:09.104 --> 19:11.411
One o'clock, shopping bag.

19:12.499 --> 19:13.500
I'm on it.

19:20.376 --> 19:21.421
[grunts]

19:36.697 --> 19:38.264
[grunting]

19:46.272 --> 19:49.449
[grunting]

19:56.020 --> 19:57.805
[choking]

20:04.899 --> 20:06.379
CIA?

20:06.422 --> 20:07.902
NYPD.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.561
AINSLEY:
What am I doing?

20:14.604 --> 20:16.563
I should be working this story.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.913
I'm the one who figured out that
your boyfriend is super shady.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.784
Again, not my...

20:20.828 --> 20:23.134
Fine, your-your special pal.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.962
I don't care what we call him.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.400
I am not afraid
of Nicholas Endicott.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.663
Or any other old man

20:29.706 --> 20:31.578
in a $20,000 suit.

20:31.621 --> 20:34.581
I am not afraid of him, Ainsley.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.713
I liked him.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.674
He was the first man
in a long time that I could...

20:42.676 --> 20:44.460
He was a widower.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.983
I thought he was broken like me.

20:46.027 --> 20:48.029
I thought he understood.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.424
But I was wrong.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.603
So...

20:56.646 --> 20:59.475
until you have endured
a lifetime of heartache,

20:59.519 --> 21:02.304
maybe you could
give the old woman

21:02.348 --> 21:05.916
in a $20,000 suit
a little credit.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.311
Mom... two things.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.793
First, I am going
to take Endicott down.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.447
Second...

21:14.490 --> 21:15.970
you're not old.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.931
[laughs]

21:22.193 --> 21:23.369
Oh, no, please, Ainsley.

21:23.412 --> 21:24.631
I'm a reporter.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.372
This is what I do.

21:36.556 --> 21:40.777
Two weeks ago,
you took someone from me.

21:40.821 --> 21:43.345
Eve Blanchard
clawed her way out

21:43.389 --> 21:46.740
from a nightmare childhood.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.177
She built herself a life.

21:49.220 --> 21:52.354
She wasn't like you or me.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.877
She was good.

21:53.921 --> 21:56.358
It's a job.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.925
I know that.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.409
But you killed her.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.901
Maybe you know something
about nightmare childhoods.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.295
Is that accent Warsaw?

22:20.339 --> 22:23.080
Are you a profiler?

22:23.124 --> 22:24.255
I work with the police.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.257
Don't bother.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.781
You can't shrink me.

22:27.824 --> 22:30.000
[sighs heavily]

22:32.176 --> 22:33.569
I need to understand you.

22:36.267 --> 22:39.836
I need to understand
why Eve Blanchard is dead.

22:39.880 --> 22:43.753
My one phone call
was to the CIA.

22:43.797 --> 22:46.408
They've offered me a job before.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.628
Today I accepted.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.979
So our time together is limited.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.375
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.420
She sounds lovely.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.468
But I didn't kill her.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.861
I've been set up on Conrad
for the last month.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.388
How did she die?

23:10.606 --> 23:13.435
Drowned.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.741
Apparent suicide.

23:14.784 --> 23:17.787
Ooh.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.441
Tough job.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.791
You have to really sell it.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.097
[door opens]

23:25.491 --> 23:26.840
Your lawyer is here.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.668
[whispers]:
CIA.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.282
What do you mean,
"you need to sell it"?

23:40.854 --> 23:43.117
Staging a suicide
is complicated.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.947
In success, there is not even
a whisper of foul play.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.514
So you have to get close.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.646
You have to get to know them.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.996
Their home, their habits.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.347
It's tedious...

23:56.391 --> 23:58.567
but lucrative.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.488
I'm sorry.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.577
We'll keep eyes on her.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.492
What if she's telling the truth?

24:10.536 --> 24:14.453
Whoever it was found their way
into Eve's life.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.240
We need to go to her apartment.

24:24.724 --> 24:27.030
Any update on Mr. David's
illness?

24:27.074 --> 24:30.469
I'm not sure.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.992
I guess I can ask.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.690
Thank you.

24:34.734 --> 24:37.519
He and I have been together
such a long time now,

24:37.563 --> 24:41.044
I, uh, I can't help but worry.

24:41.088 --> 24:43.220
Hmm.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.135
And I requested the telephone.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.225
Where is it?

24:48.269 --> 24:50.184
I need to check on my family.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.012
I-I was told, on this unit,

24:52.055 --> 24:54.449
prisoners aren't
allowed phone access.

24:56.973 --> 24:59.759
I am not like other prisoners.

24:59.802 --> 25:01.630
[laughs softly]

25:03.589 --> 25:05.112
[lock buzzes]

25:07.070 --> 25:09.072
-[sighs]
-[door closes]

25:21.737 --> 25:23.434
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

25:41.365 --> 25:45.152
What do you think?
Is this acceptable?

25:45.195 --> 25:47.154
The guards call it
"the penthouse."

25:47.197 --> 25:49.939
I guess that's gallows humor,

25:49.983 --> 25:52.725
but it's apt,
all things considered.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.074
What's the square footage?

25:54.117 --> 25:56.076
I don't know, Martin.

25:58.905 --> 26:02.212
I could put some shelves here.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.040
A desk.

26:04.084 --> 26:07.957
A Persian rug would do wonders.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.358
[scoffs]
Don't look so paranoid, Martin.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.578
I'd never poison you.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.884
I just thought you might like
one last taste

26:21.928 --> 26:23.582
of ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape.

26:24.844 --> 26:27.281
You should have
let it breathe first.

26:49.216 --> 26:51.131
â™ª

27:00.227 --> 27:02.969
This is the last time we will
ever see each other again.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.145
I've secured you
a very comfortable cage.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.669
I hope that we can walk away

27:07.713 --> 27:09.366
two satisfied parties.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.892
As long as...

27:12.935 --> 27:14.720
I get certain assurances.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.507
To dÃ©tente.

27:20.813 --> 27:23.380
[speaking indistinctly]

27:30.605 --> 27:32.128
AINSLEY:
Oh, excuse me?

27:32.172 --> 27:34.696
-I-I didn't order this.
-NICHOLAS: You should have.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.699
Pinot grigio, as a rule,

27:37.743 --> 27:39.962
has no personality.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.051
[whispers]:
I think it's time we had a chat.

27:50.103 --> 27:53.236
Earthy, isn't it?
A bit gamey, even?

27:53.280 --> 27:55.282
-It's delicious.
-Well, of course it is.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.327
ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape.

28:00.287 --> 28:03.290
This is such a treat,
the two of us, sharing a drink.

28:04.857 --> 28:07.294
But I have to ask...

28:07.337 --> 28:09.339
are you spying on me?

28:10.384 --> 28:11.951
[exhales]

28:14.562 --> 28:16.999
It can be difficult for adult
children, when their parent

28:17.043 --> 28:19.480
enters into a relationship
with someone new.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.917
I'm very protective
of my mother.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.834
I think I'm falling for her.

28:25.878 --> 28:29.098
I would do anything to...

28:29.142 --> 28:32.754
make her life one
she's excited to live again.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.756
My mother doesn't hate her life.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.150
But what Martin did,

28:37.193 --> 28:39.369
it-it's... stifled her.

28:39.413 --> 28:42.808
There's so much potential
for happiness in Jessica.

28:42.851 --> 28:46.202
And Malcolm. And you.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.467
Tell me why you're here.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.429
I want to profile you.

28:55.472 --> 28:58.606
A prime-time segment
on Endicott Pharmaceuticals.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.782
You're ambitious.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.697
That's good.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.699
And what's your endgame?

29:04.743 --> 29:07.180
An anchor seat?
Chair on The View?

29:07.223 --> 29:08.747
Or maybe you want more.

29:08.790 --> 29:12.576
How about White House
press secretary?

29:12.620 --> 29:15.579
I don't know.

29:15.623 --> 29:19.018
I guess I never really let
myself think that big.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.324
Because you never
had a man like me

29:21.368 --> 29:23.370
in your corner.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.763
Now you do.

29:28.549 --> 29:29.855
[laughs softly]

29:34.729 --> 29:36.818
Where do you want to start?

29:36.862 --> 29:39.429
Doesn't matter.

29:39.473 --> 29:42.389
[laughs softly]
I don't need gloves.

29:46.088 --> 29:49.265
Tally has these red shoes.

29:49.309 --> 29:51.615
I don't know who makes them
or what you call them,

29:51.659 --> 29:53.400
but she wore them

29:53.443 --> 29:55.837
on this really good night out.

29:55.881 --> 29:59.101
And now, every time
I see them in the closet,

29:59.145 --> 30:00.537
it comes back.

30:00.581 --> 30:03.236
That feeling...

30:03.279 --> 30:04.933
of us.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.982
Sorry, man.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.680
[quietly]:
It's okay.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.377
I'll take the bedroom.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.439
[sighs]

30:36.835 --> 30:38.271
[laughs]

30:58.726 --> 30:59.814
JT:
Yo, Bright.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.512
Did you find one, too?

31:02.556 --> 31:06.690
-They're all over the apartment.
-The killer was upstairs.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.475
This whole time.

31:10.042 --> 31:12.958
Watching us.

31:15.134 --> 31:16.875
[door closes]

31:16.918 --> 31:19.965
[exhales] You can tell
my overprotective son

31:20.008 --> 31:21.183
that I am safe.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.837
Join me?

31:22.881 --> 31:25.492
I can't stay for long.
I just came to check on you.

31:27.798 --> 31:29.888
Yeah, okay.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.717
[drinks pouring]

31:33.761 --> 31:35.067
I'm sorry.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.897
I know Eve was your friend.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.551
You should be worried
about Malcolm, not me.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.424
I always worry about Malcolm.

31:45.468 --> 31:46.948
As much as he resists it.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.690
A quality he shares
with his mother.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.611
All Eve ever knew was pain.

31:59.613 --> 32:02.746
It's such a shame
that she'll never see justice

32:02.790 --> 32:05.227
brought to the man
who took her sister.

32:05.271 --> 32:06.750
[exhales]

32:06.794 --> 32:09.492
Are you talking about Martin?
Or Nicholas?

32:11.016 --> 32:12.974
[sighs]

32:13.018 --> 32:15.498
What's the difference?

32:15.542 --> 32:17.500
They are both malicious,

32:17.544 --> 32:20.112
deceitful criminals.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.635
And I chose them.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.854
-Jess...
-What is wrong with me?

32:23.898 --> 32:26.857
What is it about me
that I attract these...

32:26.901 --> 32:28.903
these horrible men?

32:33.864 --> 32:35.910
There is nothing wrong with you.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.044
And there are good men
out there, too.

32:40.436 --> 32:43.396
[softly]:
I had a chance with a good man.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.443
I screwed it up.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.402
We both did.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.452
Too bad we missed
our window, huh?

32:56.496 --> 32:58.977
[chuckles]

32:59.020 --> 33:00.413
Yeah.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.633
Too bad.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.723
The apartment above Eve's
wasn't rented.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.595
The killer must have broken in,
squatted.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.640
Who knows how long
they were watching her.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.165
I pulled all the security
footage from the past month.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.731
Tech Services is running
facial recognition

33:14.775 --> 33:16.733
and cross-referencing
these images

33:16.777 --> 33:18.953
-with the list of known tenants.
-That'll take days.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.043
-Stop.
-[taps keyboard]

33:22.087 --> 33:23.653
That guy.

33:23.697 --> 33:25.829
Yeah, his face is angled away
from the camera.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.135
It's like he's purposely
planning his movements

33:27.179 --> 33:28.354
to avoid it.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.488
JT:
Look, Bright,
there he is again.

33:32.532 --> 33:34.925
BRIGHT:
Hat. Headphones.

33:34.969 --> 33:36.405
Look.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.190
Hoodie.

33:38.233 --> 33:39.539
DANI:
What does it mean?

33:39.582 --> 33:40.801
And who wears
white pants every day?

33:40.844 --> 33:42.063
BRIGHT:
Hold on.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.413
His ears are always covered.

33:44.457 --> 33:45.501
Why?

33:45.545 --> 33:47.721
Because they'll identify him.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.375
The pants are his uniform.

33:49.418 --> 33:50.680
It's Eddie, the new guard.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.073
He's got
perichondral hematoma.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.466
Cauliflower ear.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.555
We have to get
to Claremont. Now.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.611
Doctor, you have a visitor.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.352
How wonderful.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.398
Is it my son?

34:12.441 --> 34:14.661
-EDDIE: Mm-hmm.
-Perhaps he's, uh,

34:14.704 --> 34:16.837
finally decided
to heed my warning.

34:18.491 --> 34:21.929
You were right,
you're not like other prisoners.

34:21.972 --> 34:25.454
You shouldn't have told
your family about Mr. Endicott.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.152
[choking, gasping]

34:32.374 --> 34:33.941
[choking, gasping]

34:33.984 --> 34:35.160
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

34:40.687 --> 34:43.472
NYPD!
Open the door!

34:47.520 --> 34:48.521
Dr. Whitly!

34:48.564 --> 34:49.565
Hey, we need help!

34:51.828 --> 34:53.308
[grunts weakly]

34:53.352 --> 34:56.311
Dad! No!

34:59.227 --> 35:00.881
[grunts] Oh!

35:13.850 --> 35:15.374
This is for my son.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.027
No. Stop.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.421
BRIGHT:
No!

35:19.465 --> 35:20.640
-No.
-[yelling]

35:21.641 --> 35:23.338
[Eddie continues yelling]

35:23.382 --> 35:26.211
Open this door.
Open this door.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.387
[yelling continues]

35:28.430 --> 35:30.389
-NYPD. Let him go!
-Dr. Whitly,

35:30.432 --> 35:32.042
-take your hands off him.
-Let him go!

35:34.088 --> 35:35.742
[handcuffs clicking]

35:37.396 --> 35:39.876
Call for medical assistance.
Go, go, go.

35:39.920 --> 35:43.358
You're under arrest
for the murder of Eve Blanchard.

35:46.709 --> 35:47.928
JT, you good?

35:47.971 --> 35:50.844
So, this is JT.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.716
I've met the whole team. Hi.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.849
I'm Martin.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.418
Good thing
you came in when you did.

35:59.461 --> 36:01.463
I was being brutally attacked.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.423
Yeah.

36:04.466 --> 36:07.077
Good thing.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.210
JESSICA:
And he... he threw

36:09.254 --> 36:10.951
-his little glove...
-No.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.301
...right at Luisa, and then
he marched back to the car

36:13.345 --> 36:15.085
with his little arms
pumping dramatically

36:15.129 --> 36:17.218
the entire way.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.828
[both laughing]

36:20.221 --> 36:21.657
Mm.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.268
-GIL: Mm.
-[laughs]

36:26.271 --> 36:27.620
[laughs]

36:31.014 --> 36:32.581
I should go.

36:33.582 --> 36:34.888
Oh. Yes.

36:34.931 --> 36:37.064
No, of course. It's late.
[chuckles]

36:37.107 --> 36:39.588
But thank you.

36:39.632 --> 36:41.199
I needed this.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.118
Gil.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.910
We didn't miss our window.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.260
I slammed it shut.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.914
You were right to.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.657
I met Jackie.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.008
Had a whole life.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.446
We moved on, Jess.
No regrets.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.056
I have regrets.

37:13.100 --> 37:17.017
I do. I told you
we were from different worlds.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.933
-We are.
-But that's not
why I ended things.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.850
[Jessica sighs]

37:23.893 --> 37:25.765
I was scared.

37:25.808 --> 37:28.289
You were the one good thing

37:28.333 --> 37:30.465
in my son's life.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.773
I let you believe...

37:33.816 --> 37:36.993
that you weren't
good enough for me...

37:37.037 --> 37:39.474
because it was...

37:39.518 --> 37:43.304
easier than admitting...

37:43.348 --> 37:46.481
that I could never be
good enough for you.

37:50.659 --> 37:52.792
You're good enough, Jess.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.315
[Jessica sighs]

37:55.708 --> 37:59.233
You have always
been good enough.

38:26.956 --> 38:29.176
[sighs]
Killer's in the hospital.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.700
We got a uni on him.
He's not going anywhere

38:31.744 --> 38:33.398
till we question him
in the morning.

38:33.441 --> 38:36.618
No matter what,
it's a good collar.

38:36.662 --> 38:39.012
It doesn't bring her back.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.277
I'm sorry.

38:44.670 --> 38:47.325
You did it.
You got the guy that killed Eve.

38:48.413 --> 38:49.762
That matters.

39:13.046 --> 39:14.656
He doesn't matter.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.789
There's no profile.

39:16.832 --> 39:19.661
And he killed Eve
because it was his job.

39:20.967 --> 39:23.796
Endicott hired him to do it.

39:25.319 --> 39:27.016
He'll make a deal.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.714
That's not gonna happen.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.067
You're right.

39:35.242 --> 39:36.417
Where are you going?

39:36.461 --> 39:38.027
Bright.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.426
I'm with Major Crimes.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.428
Lieutenant Arroyo sent me.

39:47.472 --> 39:48.908
[medical monitor beeping]

39:48.951 --> 39:50.649
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

40:07.013 --> 40:08.101
Hello, Eddie.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.933
MARTIN: What do you mean
by "assurances"?

40:13.976 --> 40:15.761
You're already locked up,

40:15.804 --> 40:17.980
and this cell suits you,
for now.

40:18.024 --> 40:21.027
But what happens in ten years,
when you're a caged animal

40:21.070 --> 40:24.465
and when you go stir-crazy
and decide to burn it all down?

40:24.509 --> 40:26.032
We have a deal:

40:26.075 --> 40:29.470
mutual assurance or...

40:29.514 --> 40:31.429
mutual destruction.

40:32.821 --> 40:34.606
I need more.

40:34.649 --> 40:38.087
I take comfort
in a certain measure of control,

40:38.131 --> 40:40.133
and my business
provides it for me.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.179
What do you want?

40:43.223 --> 40:46.226
[chuckles]: I broke some laws,
just like you...

40:46.269 --> 40:50.143
but my business trades in
the science of the human body.

40:50.186 --> 40:53.668
It's helped me realize that
there's one form of leverage

40:53.712 --> 40:55.801
that trumps all the others.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.151
So I use it.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.154
Don't cross me, Martin.

41:01.197 --> 41:04.070
If you tell anyone
about Sophie Sanders,

41:04.113 --> 41:06.376
I will do more than destroy you,

41:06.420 --> 41:08.378
I will destroy
your entire family.

41:08.422 --> 41:09.945
Do not threaten my...

41:09.989 --> 41:12.861
I will bankrupt your estate,
ruin your children,

41:12.905 --> 41:15.560
and make love
to your beautiful wife.

41:25.961 --> 41:28.268
But it probably
won't come to that.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.531
And in the meantime,

41:30.575 --> 41:33.403
I'll make sure
you get a nice rug.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.709
Deal?

41:54.033 --> 41:55.077
[laughs]

41:56.949 --> 41:58.864
I can't do this anymore.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.441
I need you to go.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.272
I said go!

42:18.144 --> 42:20.799
[distorted banging]

42:22.365 --> 42:23.932
Whoa.

42:23.976 --> 42:26.718
Whoa. My name's Malcolm Bright.
I work with the NYPD.

42:29.677 --> 42:30.896
Gil.

42:38.991 --> 42:40.427
Eddie was killed
in the hospital.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.647
Edrisa found DNA on the body.

42:43.778 --> 42:45.301
Your DNA.

42:45.345 --> 42:47.303
Well, he was alive
when I went to question him.

42:47.347 --> 42:49.044
This was not
an accidental transfer.

42:49.088 --> 42:50.829
It was hair...

42:50.872 --> 42:52.526
skin cells
under the fingernails.

42:54.528 --> 42:55.964
Too much to ignore.

42:56.008 --> 42:58.097
That's impossible.

43:00.882 --> 43:02.492
I'm sorry.

43:02.536 --> 43:04.582
Gil, you...
you know I didn't do this.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.714
JT:
Malcolm Bright, you're
under arrest for murder.

43:41.575 --> 43:44.143
MAN:
Greg, move your head.
