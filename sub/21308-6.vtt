WEBVTT

00:50.468 --> 00:51.968
Get it out,
all of it!

00:51.968 --> 00:53.888
This is my castle.
I don't want to see

00:53.888 --> 00:56.928
a single Butterfly face.
Move it!

01:01.218 --> 01:03.798
Wait, wait, wait.
What am I looking at here?

01:05.258 --> 01:08.718
No Butterflies.
Get that out of here.

01:11.888 --> 01:13.758
Is that the last
of it?

01:13.758 --> 01:16.798
And with that, everything
in my kingdom is in order.

01:18.298 --> 01:20.718
Corncobs here.
Get your corncobs.

01:20.718 --> 01:22.628
No, no, not again!

01:24.928 --> 01:27.258
These rats have eaten me
out of house and home.

01:27.258 --> 01:29.258
Right, they will do that.

01:29.258 --> 01:30.888
Okay, a few kinks
to work out,

01:30.888 --> 01:32.798
but overall, the citizens
of Mewni love me.

01:32.798 --> 01:34.548
Hey, merch vendor,

01:34.548 --> 01:36.428
how are the King Ludo
T

01:36.428 --> 01:39.388
Very, very,
very not good.

01:39.388 --> 01:40.838
Not good at all,
Your Majesty.

01:40.838 --> 01:42.468
What about the masks?

01:42.468 --> 01:44.838
Those especially.
Here, I'll show you.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.838
Greetings,
young man.

01:46.838 --> 01:49.758
Might I interest you
in a King Ludo mask?

01:49.758 --> 01:52.258
- Run, baby, run!

01:52.258 --> 01:53.928
Maybe it's the beard.

01:53.928 --> 01:56.388
No, my lord, they just
don't like you.

01:56.388 --> 01:58.178
Oh, honey, look at
all that great stuff.

01:58.178 --> 02:00.088
Wow, we should load up.

02:00.088 --> 02:02.468
Finally,
someone with taste.

02:02.468 --> 02:04.588
Let me just...

02:04.588 --> 02:05.888
This will look great
in our foyer.

02:05.888 --> 02:07.718
How much for
this handsome fella?

02:07.718 --> 02:09.298
Oh, well...

02:09.298 --> 02:10.928
It's not for sale.
Come on.

02:10.928 --> 02:13.088
You know what? That's it.
Levitato!

02:15.338 --> 02:17.888
There. All that terrible
Butterfly stuff is gone.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.718
Now, how about a nice
King Ludo coffee mug,

02:20.718 --> 02:23.088
- We don't want your stuff.

02:23.088 --> 02:26.758
Yeah, we don't
like you; nobody
likes you, dude.

02:26.758 --> 02:27.928
See what I'm
dealing with here?

02:27.928 --> 02:29.258
I am your king.

02:29.258 --> 02:31.048
I command you to like me.

02:31.048 --> 02:32.508
No.

02:37.548 --> 02:38.928
Checkmate.

02:38.928 --> 02:41.928
I'm bad at everything.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.888
First rule
of chess, Marco:

02:43.888 --> 02:46.128
you must always
protect your king.

02:49.928 --> 02:52.718
- You're coming with me.

02:52.718 --> 02:55.588
No way. I'm not
going anywhere with you.

02:55.588 --> 02:56.718
That's too bad.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.468
It's urgent royal business.

02:58.468 --> 03:01.758
I need you to command
the people to like me.

03:01.758 --> 03:05.008
Why would I do that?
I don't even like you.

03:05.008 --> 03:06.838
Shuffling about
and talking to
that wand hand of yours.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.128
It's weird.

03:09.128 --> 03:12.548
Fine. If you won't help me,
then you can just
rot in this cell.

03:12.548 --> 03:14.628
Say good-bye
to your freedom.

03:17.888 --> 03:20.838
Come on,
you stupid chain.

03:20.838 --> 03:22.258
Ha ha!

03:22.258 --> 03:23.888
Ho ho. Ludo.

03:25.968 --> 03:27.388
Butter.

03:30.048 --> 03:31.718
Change of plan.

03:31.718 --> 03:34.428
I'm giving you 24 hours
to figure out a way

03:34.428 --> 03:36.298
to make the people
of Mewni like me,

03:36.298 --> 03:38.088
or I'll...

03:38.088 --> 03:41.298
I'll levitato you
into the sky forever.

03:41.298 --> 03:43.678
Oh, I'm so scared.

03:43.678 --> 03:45.258
Twenty-four hours.

03:46.718 --> 03:48.758
Dude, Ludo's gone
completely nuts.

03:48.758 --> 03:50.298
You're telling me.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.718
He left behind
a perfectly good
stick of butter.

03:52.718 --> 03:55.628
Oh, I can...
almost taste it.

03:55.628 --> 03:57.888
River, now is no time for...

03:57.888 --> 03:59.838
butter.

04:01.428 --> 04:03.218
Yes, you're
young and limber.

04:03.218 --> 04:04.928
Reach out for it, boy.

04:04.928 --> 04:07.338
Excellent!
Ha ha!

04:07.338 --> 04:09.128
Ha ha!

04:09.128 --> 04:11.678
Careful. Save some
for the gruel, boy.

04:13.088 --> 04:14.718
Nice work, Marco.

04:14.718 --> 04:17.088
Here. Butter yourself up,
and I'll see if I can

04:17.088 --> 04:18.678
figure a way out of here.

04:18.678 --> 04:19.928
Try the AC vent.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.928
The dungeon has
air conditioning?

04:22.928 --> 04:24.838
It's a dungeon,
not a torture chamber.

04:24.838 --> 04:27.928
Nice. How are those
shackles coming?

04:27.928 --> 04:30.258
I don't think
this is going to work.

04:30.258 --> 04:33.258
River, did you
eat the butter, River?

04:33.258 --> 04:35.548
I used to be king.

04:35.548 --> 04:37.888
Okay, okay, I'll go
steal that key from Ludo,

04:37.888 --> 04:39.338
and then we'll both
get out of here.

04:39.338 --> 04:41.928
You should just go.
This isn't your fight.

04:43.758 --> 04:46.218
Marco, listen to your king.

04:50.298 --> 04:52.968
Whoa. The royal bedroom.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.888
Ludo.

05:05.928 --> 05:08.258
- Sh.

05:08.258 --> 05:10.718
Quiet, dude.
You're gonna
get us caught.

05:10.718 --> 05:14.048
Whoo, how'd I ever live
without a solid gold toilet?

05:14.048 --> 05:16.258
What the heck
is going on here?

05:16.258 --> 05:18.338
Since Ludo took over,
we've been hiding in
the vents.

05:18.338 --> 05:21.758
When he's not around,
we eat his royal leftovers.

05:21.758 --> 05:23.678
And bathe in
his royal bubble bath.

05:26.838 --> 05:28.888
And sleep in
his royal bed.

05:28.888 --> 05:30.968
She was miming that
we sleep in his royal bed.

05:30.968 --> 05:33.088
LUDO: Those villagers
are so ungrateful.

05:33.088 --> 05:34.968
And end scene.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.548
I don't get it.

05:41.548 --> 05:44.008
How are these things
not flying off the shelf?

05:44.008 --> 05:47.338
It can't be for my lack of
devilishly good looks.

05:47.338 --> 05:50.718
I've got that whole
levitatoing King River to do.

05:52.718 --> 05:55.548
Being a king is
simply exhausting.

05:59.628 --> 06:01.338
Now's our chance.

06:01.338 --> 06:03.388
If we can get
that key from Ludo,
we can free the king and--

06:03.388 --> 06:05.298
Whoa. I'm gonna have
to stop you right there.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.128
You see, as artists,

06:07.128 --> 06:09.088
our job is to comment
on the world around us,

06:09.088 --> 06:11.928
not "doing stuff."

06:11.928 --> 06:14.388
A heavy burden, yes,
but that's what it means

06:14.388 --> 06:16.388
to be an artiste.

06:16.388 --> 06:18.128
Oh, please.
You, an artist?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.798
- You're nothing but
a jingle scribbler.
- And you're a buffoon.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.928
The buffoon is merely
the facade

06:22.928 --> 06:24.678
for my pointed
social commentary.

06:24.678 --> 06:26.968
That's what makes me
a true artist.

06:26.968 --> 06:28.758
Not as much of an artist
as the mime.

06:28.758 --> 06:31.508
Obviously. We all know
the mime is an artistic genius.

06:32.758 --> 06:35.048
- BOTH: Genius.
- Guys, look.

06:35.048 --> 06:37.258
I'm not a soldier either,
but there's a time

06:37.258 --> 06:39.678
when you have to get
off the sidelines
and get involved.

06:39.678 --> 06:41.888
If the four of us
work together,

06:41.888 --> 06:43.798
we can save
the true king of Mewni.

06:43.798 --> 06:45.388
Now who's with me?

06:45.388 --> 06:48.548
Now, see, I wouldn't
use that hand gesture.

06:48.548 --> 06:50.798
It's just been
done to death.

06:50.798 --> 06:52.428
And you never want to
end a sentence with a pronoun.

06:52.428 --> 06:54.718
You all
make me sick.

07:03.718 --> 07:06.928
No. I don't want
to shave the corn.

07:20.628 --> 07:22.428
What

07:22.428 --> 07:24.388
Who's in
my royal bedroom?

07:24.388 --> 07:25.388
A guy in a mask.

07:25.388 --> 07:28.128
We're here to...

07:28.128 --> 07:30.338
entertain you,
my lord.

07:30.338 --> 07:32.088
What?

07:36.718 --> 07:38.548
In the middle
of the night?

07:38.548 --> 07:39.798
Oh, yeah, because, uh...

07:39.798 --> 07:43.128
And we wrote
this song about... you.

07:43.128 --> 07:45.678
You wrote a song

Three Artists
And A Buffoon.

08:53.178 --> 08:55.178
Okay, that's it.

08:55.178 --> 08:57.588
You're the buffoon.

08:57.588 --> 09:00.758
You make fart jokes.
I make art.

09:00.758 --> 09:02.838
You call that
noise art?

09:02.838 --> 09:04.338
Your rhymes are whack!

09:04.338 --> 09:06.588
Yeah, well, yours
are hack.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.588
Oh, good one.

09:08.588 --> 09:11.218
- Hey, hey.
- Hey!

09:13.838 --> 09:15.758
Stop.
You're all hacks,

09:15.758 --> 09:19.678
except for the mime.
She's a genius.

09:19.678 --> 09:20.798
Get them!

09:29.128 --> 09:30.758
I can't believe this.

09:30.758 --> 09:32.388
I almost had the key.

09:32.388 --> 09:34.508
Can't you two get along
for just one minute?

09:34.508 --> 09:35.798
We like not
getting along.

09:35.798 --> 09:38.218
Yeah. We're good at it.

09:38.218 --> 09:40.718
Wow! You guys
really had me fooled.

09:40.718 --> 09:43.888
No, we really do
hate each other.

09:45.928 --> 09:47.718
Ah!

09:47.718 --> 09:49.468
Marco!

09:49.468 --> 09:51.338
Hey, king, we're
busting you outta here.

09:51.338 --> 09:53.088
What are you doing?

09:53.088 --> 09:54.678
I won't abandon
my people.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.628
What?!

09:56.628 --> 09:59.258
Sometimes, you've got
to let the king go.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.258
Time's up.

10:05.258 --> 10:06.928
So, um... ready to...

10:06.928 --> 10:09.548
Where's my key?

10:11.758 --> 10:14.008
I must've dropped my key
right in front of you,

10:14.008 --> 10:16.258
and you didn't
even notice. What?!

10:16.258 --> 10:19.548
You could have been running free
by now, prancing in the fields.

10:19.548 --> 10:22.048
Must make you
feel pretty silly.

10:22.048 --> 10:24.048
Ha ha. Spider!

10:25.338 --> 10:27.888
So are you going to force
everyone to like me,

10:27.888 --> 10:29.678
or is it levitato time?

10:29.678 --> 10:32.838
You may have the crown,
but you will never be king.

10:32.838 --> 10:35.758
We'll see how you feel
once you've been levitatoed.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.838
No, River!

10:41.338 --> 10:42.678
Come on!

10:45.388 --> 10:47.218
Welcome to the reign
of King Ludo.

10:47.218 --> 10:50.388
This is what happens
to anyone

10:50.388 --> 10:54.258
who doesn't show respect
and adoration for their king.

10:54.258 --> 10:55.718
You have any last words?

10:55.718 --> 10:58.048
People of Mewni,
I am not afraid.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.928
Blah blah blah.
Levitato.

11:02.968 --> 11:04.968
What are we
gonna do now?

11:04.968 --> 11:08.048
Now?
We fight.

11:09.888 --> 11:12.798
