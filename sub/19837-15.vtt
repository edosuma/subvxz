00:27.490 --> 00:29.290

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

02:01.060 --> 02:01.930
<b><i>Now!</i></b>

02:06.300 --> 02:07.730
<b>I did it!</b>

02:08.430 --> 02:09.930
<b><i>I figured it out!</i></b>

02:09.930 --> 02:13.780

<b>Gon has learned the technique</b>

02:26.800 --> 02:30.390
<b>which will enable him to 
capture his target.</b>

02:38.320 --> 02:39.040
<b>Ow!</b>

02:40.310 --> 02:41.800
<b>My hands are all bloody...</b>

02:42.330 --> 02:46.560
<b>I've been swinging my fishing

02:57.540 --> 02:59.600
<b><i>If I utilize this technique properly,</i></b>

02:59.600 --> 03:01.780
<b><i>I'll be able to steal Hisoka's tag.</i></b>

03:02.330 --> 03:05.030
<b><i>All that's left is to find Hisoka!</i></b>

03:06.250 --> 03:07.040
<b>Ow...</b>

03:10.830 --> 03:14.330
<b>But how am I supposed to find Hisoka?</b>

03:15.850 --> 03:19.980
<b>I guess I'll just have to walk around, 
and trust my instincts.</b>

03:22.760 --> 03:23.780
<b>What?</b>

03:25.100 --> 03:26.560
<b>Why are they gathering around me?</b>

03:37.970 --> 03:39.070
<b><i>These butterflies...</i></b>

03:40.090 --> 03:43.570
<b><i>They're attracted to the scent of blood.</i></b>

03:54.810 --> 03:55.750
<b>Hisoka,</b>

03:55.750 --> 03:57.470
<b>have you taken your target's tag?</b>

03:57.470 --> 03:59.590
<b>No, not yet.</b>

04:00.240 --> 04:03.590
<b>You don't even know who 
your target is, do you?</b>

04:03.590 --> 04:04.690
<b>No.</b>

04:05.450 --> 04:07.100
<b>Want me to tell you?</b>

04:07.100 --> 04:10.100
<b>No, it doesn't matter.</b>

04:13.480 --> 04:16.110
<b>I'll just find three others to hunt.</b>

04:27.430 --> 04:31.870
<b><i>I remember that, back at the tower, 
Hisoka was injured.</i></b>

04:32.250 --> 04:36.380
<b><i>If this works, the butterflies 
might lead me to him.</i></b>

04:48.620 --> 04:49.390
<b>Ah...</b>

04:57.240 --> 05:00.320
<b>It's the guy who was grazed

05:06.090 --> 05:08.820
<b>Better luck next year!</b>

05:53.730 --> 05:55.080
<b><i>There he is!</i></b>

06:07.970 --> 06:09.140
<b><i>Stay calm...</i></b>

06:11.540 --> 06:12.850
<b><i>Stay calm!</i></b>

06:23.190 --> 06:24.670
<b><i>I just need to wait.</i></b>

06:28.050 --> 06:29.900
<b><i>For Hisoka to make his move.</i></b>

06:34.920 --> 06:39.120
<b>Man, where is everyone hiding?</b>

06:41.640 --> 06:45.130
<b>I haven't seen anyone for 
the past two days.</b>

06:48.200 --> 06:49.140
<b>Who's there?</b>

06:49.140 --> 06:50.970
<b>Oh, hold on!</b>

06:51.570 --> 06:53.350
<b>It's just me...</b>

06:53.350 --> 06:54.350
<b>Tonpa!</b>

06:54.350 --> 06:55.810
<b>Don't tell me that your target is...</b>

06:55.810 --> 06:56.990
<b>Hey, wait a second!</b>

06:56.990 --> 06:58.480
<b>Just calm down.</b>

06:58.480 --> 07:01.250
<b>You aren't my target.</b>

07:01.250 --> 07:02.680
<b>Prove it.</b>

07:02.680 --> 07:04.480
<b>Right...</b>

07:05.140 --> 07:06.130
<b>Here.</b>

07:12.520 --> 07:16.020
<b>Good thing I didn't throw it away.</b>

07:16.020 --> 07:18.170
<b>Fighting people who aren't my target</b>

07:18.170 --> 07:20.560
<b>is a waste of time and energy.</b>

07:23.660 --> 07:27.260
<b>Don't tell me that I'm your target!</b>

07:27.260 --> 07:29.320
<b>Unfortunately, you're not.</b>

07:31.350 --> 07:33.010
<b>#246.</b>

07:33.920 --> 07:35.190
<b>Ponzu, huh?</b>

07:35.190 --> 07:35.900
<b>Huh?</b>

07:35.900 --> 07:38.030
<b>You know who this is?</b>

07:38.030 --> 07:39.830
<b>You didn't already know?</b>

07:39.830 --> 07:41.890
<b>Uh, er, well...</b>

07:41.890 --> 07:44.040
<b>I wouldn't put it that way.</b>

07:44.040 --> 07:46.770
<b>I just didn't have a chance 
to find out...</b>

07:47.710 --> 07:48.880
<b>Heh.</b>

07:48.880 --> 07:50.530
<b>Want me to fill you in?</b>

07:50.530 --> 07:51.740
<b>What?</b>

07:51.740 --> 07:54.460
<b>Your target's appearance, weapons,</b>

07:54.460 --> 07:56.550
<b>special abilities, and weaknesses.</b>

07:57.530 --> 08:00.590
<b>However, I have one condition.</b>

08:03.670 --> 08:04.650
<b>Huh?</b>

08:04.650 --> 08:07.820
<b>I think I ate some bad fruit.</b>

08:07.820 --> 08:09.380
<b>Bad fruit...</b>

08:09.380 --> 08:12.620
<b>To be honest, I can barely stand...</b>

08:12.620 --> 08:14.590
<b>You want to become a doctor, right?</b>

08:14.590 --> 08:17.090
<b>Do you have any medicine on you?</b>

08:18.010 --> 08:19.350
<b>I got it...</b>

08:19.350 --> 08:20.270
<b>Don't soil yourself.</b>

08:23.200 --> 08:27.020
<b>I have all kinds of anti-diarrheal 
and stomach medicine.</b>

08:27.020 --> 08:28.150
<b>Oh...</b>

08:28.150 --> 08:29.640
<b>Thank you so much!</b>

08:30.130 --> 08:31.530
<b>First, tell me what you know.</b>

08:31.530 --> 08:34.530
<b>F-Fine...</b>

08:37.550 --> 08:40.300
<b>Ponzu is a female applicant.</b>

08:40.300 --> 08:41.540
<b>Female?</b>

08:42.120 --> 08:43.650
<b>As far as I know,</b>

08:43.650 --> 08:47.050
<b>five of the remaining 
twenty-four applicants</b>

08:47.050 --> 08:50.380
<b>use some sort of chemical weapon.</b>

08:50.380 --> 08:52.550
<b>Ponzu is one of those.</b>

08:55.650 --> 08:57.300
<b>So she's the one.</b>

08:57.300 --> 08:59.140
<b>This girl happens to</b>

08:59.140 --> 09:01.990
<b>specialize in all kinds of drugs.</b>

09:01.990 --> 09:04.250
<b>But her strategy is simple...</b>

09:04.250 --> 09:06.060
<b>Hide and wait.</b>

09:06.060 --> 09:07.000
<b>Hide and wait?</b>

09:07.000 --> 09:11.140
<b>She sets a trap and waits for 
her target to show up.</b>

09:11.140 --> 09:12.710
<b>I see...</b>

09:12.710 --> 09:16.300
<b>You shouldn't have to worry 
about anything else.</b>

09:16.300 --> 09:20.410
<b>If you make it a close-quarters fight, 
you're guaranteed to win.</b>

09:22.810 --> 09:24.060
<b>If you find her,</b>

09:24.060 --> 09:27.420
<b>watch your footing, and note which 
direction the wind is blowing.</b>

09:27.420 --> 09:31.500
<b>Sh-She's fully aware that 
someone else</b>

09:31.500 --> 09:33.640
<b>is targeting her.</b>

09:35.310 --> 09:37.380
<b>Th-That's pretty much it.</b>

09:37.910 --> 09:40.550
<b>G-Give me the medicine...</b>

09:40.550 --> 09:41.430
<b>Okay.</b>

09:41.430 --> 09:43.930
<b>To be safe, back up a bit.</b>

09:44.750 --> 09:46.440
<b>H-Hurry...</b>

09:46.440 --> 09:48.940
<b>I-I can't hold it in!</b>

09:59.320 --> 10:00.570
<b><i>Damn!</i></b>

10:07.640 --> 10:09.630
<b>Your tag is mine.</b>

10:09.630 --> 10:12.750
<b>I knew you were keeping your 
tag in your suitcase.</b>

10:12.750 --> 10:13.500
<b>Tonpa!</b>

10:13.500 --> 10:15.440
<b>You two are working together?</b>

10:15.440 --> 10:17.010
<b>Exactly so.</b>

10:17.010 --> 10:18.380
<b>I didn't need your medicine.</b>

10:18.380 --> 10:20.010
<b>I have my own.</b>

10:20.010 --> 10:21.680
<b>And I might as well confess</b>

10:21.680 --> 10:24.530
<b>that you actually are my target.</b>

10:26.020 --> 10:28.160
<b>Wh-What about the card you 
just showed me?</b>

10:28.160 --> 10:30.590
<b>That's my target.</b>

10:30.590 --> 10:32.520
<b>This is Tonpa's.</b>

10:32.520 --> 10:35.140
<b>We swapped cards.</b>

10:35.140 --> 10:38.530
<b>And you fell for our little trick...</b>

10:39.240 --> 10:41.150
<b>There you have it.</b>

10:43.370 --> 10:45.660
<b>Damn you!</b>

10:45.660 --> 10:47.620
<b>I'll make you pay!</b>

10:47.620 --> 10:48.910
<b>Uh-oh...</b>

10:50.030 --> 10:50.810
<b>Tonpa!</b>

10:50.810 --> 10:52.450
<b>We'll meet at the usual place!</b>

10:52.450 --> 10:53.570
<b>Gotcha!</b>

10:58.460 --> 11:00.580
<b>Hold up!</b>

11:00.580 --> 11:03.180
<b>I'm gonna kill you!</b>

11:03.180 --> 11:04.460
<b>Hey, now...</b>

11:04.460 --> 11:06.270
<b>I'm not the one with your tag!</b>

11:06.600 --> 11:08.020
<b>Shut up!</b>

11:08.020 --> 11:09.260
<b>Good grief...</b>

11:09.260 --> 11:12.440
<b>You still haven't learned 
your lesson, rookie?</b>

11:12.440 --> 11:13.730
<b>What was that?</b>

11:13.730 --> 11:15.900
<b>It's your own fault for letting us trick you!</b>

11:17.740 --> 11:18.400
<b>Besides,</b>

11:18.400 --> 11:21.910
<b>working in teams during the 
Hunter Exam is common sense!</b>

11:22.420 --> 11:25.530
<b>I agree with the latter, 
but I cannot accept the former.</b>

11:26.460 --> 11:27.040
<b>Huh?</b>

11:32.690 --> 11:35.440
<b>You shouldn't be tricking people, 
in the first place!</b>

11:35.440 --> 11:36.800
<b>Kurapika...</b>

11:37.990 --> 11:41.050
<b>Leorio, want to team up?</b>

11:41.070 --> 11:51.140
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

11:47.100 --> 11:51.140
<b>Target</b>

12:02.630 --> 12:06.910
<b>Please Do Not Feed!!</b>

12:11.790 --> 12:12.920
<b>Hey!</b>

12:12.920 --> 12:15.420
<b>Return my tag!</b>

12:16.870 --> 12:19.130
<b>If you want it back, catch me.</b>

12:37.190 --> 12:38.190
<b>Okay!</b>

12:38.190 --> 12:41.590
<b>I retrieved my tag.</b>

12:41.590 --> 12:45.700
<b>And we have the tags for 
#16 and #118, as well.</b>

12:45.700 --> 12:47.010
<b>So, Kurapika,</b>

12:47.010 --> 12:49.600
<b>Tonpa was your target?</b>

12:49.600 --> 12:51.270
<b>You saved me back there.</b>

12:51.270 --> 12:53.010
<b>You needn't thank me.</b>

12:53.010 --> 12:55.670
<b>I didn't want Tonpa to notice me,</b>

12:55.670 --> 12:57.280
<b>so I stayed hidden</b>

12:57.280 --> 12:59.210
<b>while you were jumped from behind.</b>

12:59.550 --> 13:00.280
<b>What?</b>

13:00.280 --> 13:01.530
<b>Well, that was because</b>

13:01.530 --> 13:04.360
<b>I figured there'd be no point in teaming up</b>

13:04.360 --> 13:07.220
<b>with you if you couldn't 
withstand that attack.</b>

13:08.220 --> 13:10.460
<b>I suppose that you barely qualified.</b>

13:10.460 --> 13:12.730
<b>You really are full of yourself...</b>

13:12.730 --> 13:14.090
<b>Well,</b>

13:14.090 --> 13:17.170
<b>I can't deny that it's easier 
to work as a team.</b>

13:18.020 --> 13:20.230
<b>Let's stick together for the 
remaining four days.</b>

13:20.850 --> 13:22.230
<b>Yes.</b>

13:22.230 --> 13:25.450
<b>You got your target's tag.</b>

13:25.450 --> 13:28.850
<b>So with your own, that adds 
up to six points.</b>

13:28.850 --> 13:31.520
<b>Assuming he doesn't take it back.</b>

13:31.520 --> 13:35.820
<b>The #118 tag is only worth 
one point for either of us.</b>

13:35.820 --> 13:39.500
<b>But it might still come in handy.</b>

13:39.500 --> 13:42.390
<b>Next, we need to find your target,</b>

13:42.390 --> 13:45.760
<b>#246, Ponzu.</b>

13:46.330 --> 13:48.260
<b>Stay alert, in case we're being followed.</b>

13:48.260 --> 13:50.280
<b>You shouldn't be talking.</b>

13:50.280 --> 13:51.170
<b>Yeah, yeah.</b>

13:51.170 --> 13:53.270
<b>You're absolutely right.</b>

14:27.160 --> 14:30.250
<b>I know you've been following me 
since the exam began.</b>

14:30.250 --> 14:32.020
<b>You fail at hiding.</b>

14:33.470 --> 14:34.850
<b>Show yourself.</b>

14:35.530 --> 14:36.810
<b>Let's play.</b>

15:14.320 --> 15:16.100
<b>Well, come on out.</b>

15:18.810 --> 15:20.100
<b>I know you're there.</b>

15:20.650 --> 15:22.600
<b><i>He noticed me?</i></b>

15:23.860 --> 15:27.860
<b>If you won't come out, I'll come to you.</b>

15:34.900 --> 15:36.490
<b><i>I guess that's it...</i></b>

15:36.870 --> 15:40.000
<b><i>In that case, it's all or nothing.</i></b>

15:49.160 --> 15:50.510
<b><i>When did he arrive?</i></b>

16:00.750 --> 16:02.390
<b>I challenge you to a duel.</b>

16:03.660 --> 16:04.900
<b>You'll die.</b>

16:12.400 --> 16:14.410
<b><i>This is my chance!</i></b>

16:28.500 --> 16:30.420
<b><i>My chance is about to come...</i></b>

16:30.420 --> 16:33.930
<b><i>In the moment Hisoka goes 
to finish off his prey!</i></b>

16:43.650 --> 16:44.980
<b><i>Why?</i></b>

16:46.670 --> 16:49.410
<b><i>Why isn't Hisoka fighting back?</i></b>

17:01.520 --> 17:03.750
<b>Hisoka, explain yourself...</b>

17:03.750 --> 17:06.750
<b>Why won't you attack me?</b>

17:07.840 --> 17:09.780
<b>If I continue to avoid your attacks,</b>

17:09.780 --> 17:12.010
<b>you'll die eventually.</b>

17:18.310 --> 17:21.570
<b>I can tell from the swarm of 
Hemotropic Butterflies</b>

17:21.570 --> 17:24.310
<b>that your wounds are grave.</b>

17:27.180 --> 17:30.520
<b>Someone else has already dealt 
you a fatal blow, yes?</b>

17:30.520 --> 17:34.870
<b>Though I do understand your 
desire to die in battle.</b>

17:35.410 --> 17:37.880
<b>If you...</b>

17:37.880 --> 17:40.780
<b>If you understand so well,</b>

17:40.780 --> 17:45.080
<b>why do you still refuse to fight me?!</b>

17:47.150 --> 17:49.700
<b>I have no interest in the dead.</b>

17:49.700 --> 17:51.080
<b>What?</b>

17:51.080 --> 17:53.930
<b>I'm not yet...</b>

17:53.930 --> 17:56.430
<b>You're already dead.</b>

17:57.250 --> 17:58.800
<b>It's in your eyes.</b>

18:04.950 --> 18:06.060
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

18:31.840 --> 18:32.840
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

18:33.460 --> 18:35.680
<b>I carelessly let him escape.</b>

18:35.680 --> 18:37.340
<b>Liar.</b>

18:37.340 --> 18:42.120
<b>He probably begged you to grant him</b>

18:42.120 --> 18:43.740
<b>one final wish, yes?</b>

18:43.740 --> 18:46.850
<b>Well, I felt sorry for the guy.</b>

18:46.850 --> 18:49.820
<b>Given that he was dead either way.</b>

18:49.820 --> 18:53.500
<b>You should cease pitying enemies 
who serve no purpose.</b>

18:53.920 --> 18:56.080
<b>You've done it before, haven't you?</b>

18:56.080 --> 18:58.860
<b>You've walked away from opponents 
before finishing them.</b>

18:59.380 --> 19:02.230
<b>I have standards.</b>

19:02.230 --> 19:04.870
<b>I'm not interested in people 
who have no purpose.</b>

19:05.300 --> 19:08.870
<b>I only spare those whose deaths 
would go to waste.</b>

19:09.500 --> 19:11.330
<b>What about his tag?</b>

19:11.330 --> 19:13.460
<b>Oh, I already took it.</b>

19:13.460 --> 19:16.850
<b>I have six points now, 
so I don't need this one.</b>

19:16.850 --> 19:18.090
<b>You can have it.</b>

19:19.730 --> 19:21.100
<b>Whose tag is this?</b>

19:21.100 --> 19:23.930
<b>It belonged to some guy 
who tried to snipe me.</b>

19:25.390 --> 19:29.700
<b>He ticked me off, so I killed him.</b>

19:35.230 --> 19:36.240
<b>Well, then...</b>

19:51.500 --> 19:53.380
<b>This is always so fascinating to watch.</b>

19:53.380 --> 19:56.880
<b>It's pretty hard on me...</b>

20:01.460 --> 20:04.140
<b>I feel much better.</b>

20:12.990 --> 20:15.750
<b>Well, I'll just sleep here 
until the final day.</b>

20:15.750 --> 20:16.990
<b>Good luck.</b>

20:43.860 --> 20:45.930
<b>It's completely dark now.</b>

20:45.930 --> 20:48.280
<b>Keep your guard up.</b>

20:48.280 --> 20:51.280
<b>Night provides the perfect chance for 
someone to attack their target.</b>

20:51.280 --> 20:52.940
<b>I know that.</b>

20:56.440 --> 20:58.940
<b>Well, I need two more points.</b>

21:00.570 --> 21:02.700
<b>I suppose I should go hunt someone...</b>

21:06.700 --> 21:08.180
<b>I'll get him this time!</b>

21:44.130 --> 21:47.240
<b>Found you...</b>

21:48.240 --> 21:50.740
<b>Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.</b>

21:51.550 --> 21:54.000
<b>Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.</b>

21:54.930 --> 21:59.280
<b>Four days remain before the 
exam's Fourth Phase ends.</b>

23:28.380 --> 23:31.100
<b>Next time: Defeat x And x Disgrace!</b>

23:31.100 --> 23:32.670
<b>Let's shake hands!</b>

23:32.670 --> 23:34.760
<b>With a firm grip.</b>
