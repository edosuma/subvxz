on Oak Road.

00:06.375 --> 00:08.458
They're offering
a free one-week trial!

00:08.542 --> 00:11.083
They have a pool,
all-new equipment,

00:11.166 --> 00:15.166
and a "designated area for old
men to blow-dry their balls."

00:15.250 --> 00:17.166
You had me
at old men's balls.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.750

they'll do anything
to keep you happy.
