dig deep enough

07:19.799 --> 07:21.233
into what you were saying
back then

go so upside down?

08:33.035 --> 08:36.438
81/2 years ago, it cost
about $1,000 per DNA test.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.774
We took over 200 samples
from the crime scene.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.277
We had a trial budget
of 50 grand.

their 25.

off the knife.

Did you find the tip
in Mrs. Reichman's body?

09:17.114 --> 09:19.281
No. The knife,
according to the suspect...

09:19.316 --> 09:21.250
it was taken from
their kitchen, by the way...

09:21.284 --> 09:22.952

It matched up to every wound
in the victim's body.

Provenza: Not to mention
Reichman bought

09:26.156 --> 09:28.089

some cement,

and a shiny new shovel

09:29.359 --> 09:31.493
one week before
his wife's murder.

09:31.528 --> 09:33.295
Which he claimed was
for the yard.

09:33.329 --> 09:35.164
He also claimed to give
his daughter a sleeping pill.

09:35.198 --> 09:37.132
Sleeping pill?
For a 10-year-old?

09:37.167 --> 09:39.268
Reichman said, whenever
he went away on business,

09:39.302 --> 09:40.802
the daughter became hysterical.

09:40.837 --> 09:42.805
Helping her nod off
was his wife's idea.

the little girl's cocoa

Now, the kid fell asleep
before she finished it.

09:47.911 --> 09:49.946
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
woken up in time

09:49.980 --> 09:52.114
to catch her father
with that knife in his hand.

09:52.149 --> 09:53.549
The defense was right.

09:53.584 --> 09:55.284
I never gave any credence
to the intruder theory.

09:55.319 --> 09:57.320
I always thought the husband
did it from the get-go.

he's guilty as hell.

What was Mr. Reichman's alibi,
Lieutenant Tao?

10:19.343 --> 10:21.210
He arrived
at the airport late,

10:21.245 --> 10:23.146
got stuck in a long security
line, and missed his flight.

10:23.180 --> 10:24.547
Here's Mr. Reichman

10:24.581 --> 10:27.550
staring directly into
an l.A.X. Security camera

10:27.584 --> 10:29.818
at 12:04 A.M.

10:29.853 --> 10:32.855
Who looks directly into
a security camera?

10:32.889 --> 10:34.823
Hey, look, I can
give him a break there.

10:34.858 --> 10:36.525
Sometimes you can't see
those cameras.

10:36.559 --> 10:39.528
He left airport parking
at 12:16 A.M.

10:39.562 --> 10:41.930
And reported the murder
at 22 minutes after 1:00.

10:41.998 --> 10:43.399
Sanchez: What, leaving, like,
an hour and change

10:43.433 --> 10:45.067
to drive
all the way to silver lake?

10:45.101 --> 10:47.836
Plus, cut the power,
stage a break-in,

10:47.870 --> 10:49.905
kill his wife,
and call 911?

10:49.939 --> 10:53.008
I drove from l.A.X. To
the crime scene dozens of times.

10:53.042 --> 10:54.910
Varied the route, speed.

10:54.944 --> 10:57.913
That late at night, it took me
anywhere from 35 to 45 minutes,

10:57.947 --> 11:01.450
which would have given Reichman
a window of 21 to 31 minutes.

11:01.517 --> 11:02.884
Flynn: Plenty of time
to commit murder.

11:02.919 --> 11:04.886
It all fits.

11:05.921 --> 11:07.955
Except the part where
he turns out to be innocent

11:08.023 --> 11:09.957
eight years after
I sent him to prison.

11:10.025 --> 11:12.260
Mike, Mike, you got to stop
beating yourself up.

11:12.294 --> 11:14.462
The guy did it.

11:14.530 --> 11:16.163
He outfoxed the system
somehow.

11:17.432 --> 11:20.467
Tell me about our new
alternate suspect, Lieutenant.

11:20.502 --> 11:23.937
The DNA says
he's a wanted embezzler

11:23.972 --> 11:26.340
named Benito "Benny" Zapata.

11:26.374 --> 11:28.408
He's lived and worked
in Colorado Springs.

11:28.443 --> 11:29.443
Last-known whereabouts?

11:30.511 --> 11:32.913
The crime scene, I guess.

11:32.947 --> 11:34.615
Lieutenant Provenza,

11:34.649 --> 11:37.585
let's start looking
for Mr. Zapata right now

11:37.619 --> 11:39.420
and contact
our FBI liaison,

11:39.454 --> 11:41.288
since they
seem to want him, too.

11:41.322 --> 11:45.960
Lieutenant Tao, I would like to
watch the initial interview

11:45.994 --> 11:48.462
that you did
with Mr. Reichman's daughter.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.170
I heard angry voices.

11:55.204 --> 11:56.972
<i>Mom screamed.</i>

11:57.006 --> 12:00.009
<i>Someone ran</i>
<i>out of the house.</i>

12:00.043 --> 12:02.178
<i>I thought</i>
<i>daddy was gone again.</i>

12:02.212 --> 12:04.180
But I could still
hear noises,

12:04.214 --> 12:06.282
like grunting
and groaning sounds.

12:06.317 --> 12:10.220
So I got my flashlight
and I went downstairs,

12:10.254 --> 12:14.258
and that's when I saw
my daddy with the knife.

12:14.292 --> 12:17.595
<i>What was he doing</i>
<i>with the knife?</i>

12:17.629 --> 12:20.599
<i>Hurting mommy.</i>

12:20.633 --> 12:22.934
<i>Hurting her how?</i>
<i>Can you show me?</i>

12:22.969 --> 12:24.303
<i>Like this.</i>

12:26.640 --> 12:30.509
<i>Lydia, your daddy said</i>
<i>he was pulling the knife out.</i>

12:30.544 --> 12:32.978
<i>Is that possible?</i>

12:33.012 --> 12:36.148
<i>Pulling it out</i>
<i>and putting it in.</i>

12:36.182 --> 12:38.383
<i>It made noises.</i>

12:42.488 --> 12:44.389
<i>Did you see anyone else</i>
<i>in the house?</i>

12:49.128 --> 12:51.330
<i>Are you sure?</i>

12:51.364 --> 12:55.267
Just mommy and daddy.

12:56.302 --> 12:58.270
Why did you
give this DVD to my daughter?

13:00.006 --> 13:02.674
After all we've been through.

13:02.709 --> 13:04.643
Haven't you
done enough damage already?

13:25.611 --> 13:27.779
[ Knock on door ] Reichman: <i>Instead of
dragging my daughter back through this,</i>

13:27.847 --> 13:29.281
why don't you talk to me?
Where's Sharon?

13:30.716 --> 13:32.784
<i>I'll tell you</i>
<i>anything you want to know.</i>

13:32.852 --> 13:34.486
Lieutenant Provenza,
do you know how to knot a tie?

13:34.520 --> 13:37.755
You're seriously asking
this guy for advice on a tie?

13:37.790 --> 13:39.824
Yeah. Why not? He's been wearing
'em for a hundred years.

13:39.859 --> 13:42.194
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:42.228 --> 13:44.029
Give me that thing.

13:46.032 --> 13:47.099
Can you man the ship?

13:47.134 --> 13:48.567
Aye-aye.

13:48.602 --> 13:49.335
Let me.

13:51.238 --> 13:53.906
Do you want a windsor
or a half-windsor?

13:53.941 --> 13:55.775
What's the difference?

13:55.809 --> 13:57.277
What's the occasion?

13:57.311 --> 13:58.778
Oh, well,
my sperm donor

13:58.813 --> 14:00.314
is taking me and Sharon
out to dinner.

14:00.348 --> 14:02.816
I thought you didn't want to
meet your biological father.

14:02.850 --> 14:04.084
I'm calling him
"Mr. Dunn."

14:05.152 --> 14:06.620
Uh, chin up, please.

14:06.654 --> 14:08.055
And it shouldn't
come as a surprise to you,

14:08.089 --> 14:09.756
but I can be bought.

14:09.790 --> 14:11.724
The suit is a bribe.

14:12.793 --> 14:13.960
A bribe?

14:13.995 --> 14:15.295
Well, Sharon
bought me this suit

14:15.329 --> 14:17.664
to bribe me into
having dinner with the donor.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.933
I've never had a suit before...
or a tie,

14:19.968 --> 14:22.235
and I got to pick it out myself,
so I figured,

14:22.270 --> 14:23.269
you know,
I should break it in.

14:23.304 --> 14:24.638
Looks good.

14:24.672 --> 14:26.907
This must be
some fancy restaurant, huh?

14:26.941 --> 14:29.743
Yeah, it's like
"Trat-o-ria Spo-leeto"

14:29.778 --> 14:31.245
or something like that...
I don't know.

14:31.279 --> 14:32.813
But it's not gonna be
about the meal.

14:32.848 --> 14:33.914
They have
a great marinara.

14:33.949 --> 14:35.249
No, I mean,

14:35.283 --> 14:37.151
Mr. Dunn is gonna be
on the hot seat tonight.

14:37.185 --> 14:39.853
I've got, like,
47 questions to ask him.

14:42.024 --> 14:43.824
Good God,
you're not kidding.

14:43.859 --> 14:47.227
"Number 12... which would you
pay me more to do...

14:47.262 --> 14:49.630
live with you
or stay away from you?"

14:49.664 --> 14:50.998
Yeah, that one may say
number 12,

14:51.032 --> 14:52.767
but really,
it's like number 1 or 2.

14:52.801 --> 14:54.602
Definitely
an up-front question.

14:54.636 --> 14:57.071
"Why should I believe
you never knew about me?"

14:57.105 --> 14:59.340
Rusty, you don't
need these questions.

14:59.374 --> 15:01.843
The man is blood, okay?

15:01.877 --> 15:04.679
You sit down,
you look him in the eye,

15:04.713 --> 15:07.048
and then you give the man
the benefit of the doubt.

15:07.116 --> 15:09.117
No, but he should be
on the defensive, not me.

15:09.151 --> 15:11.352
Rusty,
this is not chess.

15:11.387 --> 15:12.720
No one needs to be
on the defensive.

15:12.755 --> 15:14.189
You listen to me,
young man.

15:14.223 --> 15:16.892
You got out there tonight
and have a good time.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.828
Hey, buzz, a little red light
just came on.

15:19.862 --> 15:22.131
Is it flashing
or is it steady?

15:22.165 --> 15:23.666
Um, steady?

15:23.700 --> 15:24.900
N-no, flashing.

15:24.968 --> 15:26.736
Leaving you
in charge of the <i>Titanic.</i>

15:26.770 --> 15:28.905
So...

15:28.973 --> 15:30.873
Do I look more mature?

15:34.045 --> 15:36.179
Yeah.

15:36.214 --> 15:37.848
Sure you do.

15:49.995 --> 15:51.195
Why all these questions
<i>about my daughter</i>

15:51.230 --> 15:52.830
after nearly a decade?

15:52.865 --> 15:54.232
Sharon <i>we're just</i>
<i>trying to understand</i>

15:54.266 --> 15:56.001
<i>why Lydia</i>
<i>changed her statement.</i>

15:56.035 --> 15:57.903
<i>How about,</i>
<i>she finally grew old enough</i>

15:57.937 --> 15:59.371
<i>to understand</i>
<i>right from wrong?</i>

15:59.406 --> 16:01.807
Anything new from
the architect of our misery?

16:01.842 --> 16:03.376
He's suing Tao,
the police department,

16:03.410 --> 16:05.178
and the city
for wrongful imprisonment.

16:05.212 --> 16:06.779
Shocking.

16:06.813 --> 16:08.180
My story hasn't changed,

16:08.214 --> 16:09.682
<i>and my daughter's</i>
<i>new statement, by the way,</i>

16:09.717 --> 16:10.884
<i>corroborates</i>
<i>the blood evidence</i>

16:10.919 --> 16:12.286
and what I've been saying
all along.

16:12.354 --> 16:13.854
Lydia now realizes

16:13.889 --> 16:15.456
that she, too,
saw an intruder in the house.

16:15.490 --> 16:18.292
Which you say is
Benito Zapata.

16:18.327 --> 16:21.129
DNA doesn't lie,
and neither did I, Lieutenant.

16:21.163 --> 16:22.730
Did you know him?

16:22.765 --> 16:23.831
Zapata.

16:23.866 --> 16:25.200
No.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.401
But since I found out
who he was and what he did,

16:26.435 --> 16:27.702
I've been thinking
about that.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.771
Zapata owned
an auto-body shop

16:29.805 --> 16:31.306
that was fraudulently billing
for repair.

16:31.374 --> 16:34.209
My wife, Elaine,
was an insurance adjustor.

16:34.244 --> 16:35.911
It's possible
that she found out

16:35.945 --> 16:38.046
that this creep was
stealing from her company.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.348
And you have paperwork
to document that theory?

16:40.383 --> 16:42.817
She kept stuff like that
locked away in the safe.

16:42.852 --> 16:45.320
You're the professionals,
but maybe Zapata <i>did</i> take it.

16:45.388 --> 16:47.422
I was never able
to wrap my mind around

16:47.457 --> 16:49.157
why someone
would kill Elaine

16:49.192 --> 16:50.959
after getting everything
they wanted out of the safe.

16:50.994 --> 16:52.761
But it's beginning
to make sense.

16:52.795 --> 16:55.998
Would you mind if I walk through
your house one more time,

16:56.032 --> 16:58.133
just to refamiliarize myself
with the crime scene?

16:58.168 --> 17:00.870
I don't want you in my house
or in my life,

17:00.904 --> 17:03.272
and I especially want you to
stay away from my daughter.

17:04.241 --> 17:05.974
Excuse me.

17:06.010 --> 17:07.175
You still own the house?

17:07.211 --> 17:08.911
I am an architect, captain.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.948
That house was my child.

17:11.982 --> 17:14.083
And I wanted to
walk back through the front door

17:14.117 --> 17:15.218
as a free man.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.153
<i>Anything else?</i>

17:17.186 --> 17:18.854
<i>No. You've been</i>
<i>most helpful.</i>

17:18.888 --> 17:20.056
Thank you, Mr. Reichman.

17:21.425 --> 17:25.328
I promise you, I will do
everything in my power

17:25.362 --> 17:26.829
to finally
make this right.

17:26.864 --> 17:28.298
Can you give me back

17:28.332 --> 17:31.001
the time I lost
with my daughter?

17:31.035 --> 17:34.371
Can you give me back
my reputation, my career?

17:34.405 --> 17:36.406
My friends?

17:36.441 --> 17:39.977
Because that's what I need
to make this right.

17:40.011 --> 17:42.846
Sir...

17:42.881 --> 17:45.181
I am truly sorry.

17:45.216 --> 17:47.851
Just find
the man who murdered my wife,

17:47.885 --> 17:49.919
and let's
get this over with.

17:49.953 --> 17:52.054
Do you have any idea
where he is?

17:52.122 --> 17:54.456
Fritz:
According to interpol,

17:54.491 --> 17:56.992
not in Europe, South America,
or Mexico.

17:57.026 --> 17:59.794
The Bureau's had
a UFAP warrant on Mr. Zapata

17:59.828 --> 18:00.895
since late in '04.

18:00.930 --> 18:03.064
A u-who?
Sanchez: A UFAP...

18:03.098 --> 18:04.832
unlawful flight
to avoid prosecution, buzz.

18:04.867 --> 18:06.968
Got to love
a good FBI acronym.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.369
With a proper
fake passport,

18:08.404 --> 18:10.071
Zapata could be
almost anywhere in the world.

18:10.139 --> 18:14.208
If he's still alive,
the bureau thinks he might...

18:14.243 --> 18:15.209
Look something...

18:15.244 --> 18:17.979
Like this.

18:21.216 --> 18:22.517
Unless he's had
plastic surgery.

18:23.552 --> 18:26.087
Good to have you back,
Sykes.

18:26.155 --> 18:28.489
Little ray of sunshine
returns.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.359
Zapata
walked away from his wife,

18:31.393 --> 18:33.828
his job, his entire life.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.863
We didn't even realize
he was embezzling

18:35.898 --> 18:37.932
until almost a year
after he disappeared.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.400
Does he have children?
Not that we're aware of.

18:39.434 --> 18:40.868
How much
did he embezzle?

18:40.903 --> 18:43.237
$1.8 mill...
one million, 800 thousand.

18:43.272 --> 18:46.340
So Zapata hit the sweet spot
in terms of priority cases.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.209
Yeah, he took enough
to be wanted

18:48.243 --> 18:50.144
but not enough
to be <i>too</i> wanted.

18:50.179 --> 18:52.947
Back in '04, we were all
focused on terrorism,

18:53.015 --> 18:54.983
to the exclusion of
almost everything else.

18:55.017 --> 18:56.884
Are you sure Zapata
left the country?

18:56.919 --> 18:59.520
Well, we have records
of him flying to Costa Rica

18:59.555 --> 19:01.189
one month before the murder.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.524
Plus, he speaks
fluent Spanish, so...

19:03.559 --> 19:05.126
But where'd he put
the money?

19:05.160 --> 19:07.228
We never found it.
If he's been taking it out

19:07.262 --> 19:09.564
in increments
of like $90,000 a year,

19:09.598 --> 19:11.199
that's virtually untraceable.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.366
Sykes: Me... I'd be
interested in hearing

19:12.401 --> 19:14.135
what Zapata's
wife had to say.

19:14.202 --> 19:16.237
Bureau's been keeping tabs
on her phone calls and e-mails

19:16.271 --> 19:17.438
for the last eight years.

19:17.472 --> 19:18.940
She's still
in Colorado Springs.

19:18.974 --> 19:20.274
Flynn: Well, we ought to
fly her out here.

19:20.308 --> 19:22.109
She might remember
something useful.

19:22.143 --> 19:23.611
We don't have
the budget for that.

19:24.946 --> 19:29.083
Captain, I'll pay for it myself,
out of my own pocket.

19:29.118 --> 19:30.418
Or I'll fly to her.

19:30.452 --> 19:31.986
I'll use my vacation days.

19:32.054 --> 19:33.954
I have to try to find
this Zapata guy.

19:33.989 --> 19:35.089
It's the least I can do.

19:35.124 --> 19:36.424
No, Mike,
I was thinking that,

19:36.458 --> 19:38.359
since the federal government
has an interest,

19:38.393 --> 19:40.128
maybe the FBI could fly...
we don't want her to find out

19:40.162 --> 19:41.462
we've been keeping her
under surveillance.

19:41.497 --> 19:43.164
It's been
almost nine years.

19:43.232 --> 19:44.932
I think it's possible
to say

19:44.967 --> 19:47.134
that the "watchful waiting" part
of your operation

19:47.169 --> 19:49.103
hasn't worked out.

19:50.172 --> 19:51.473
Okay.

19:51.507 --> 19:53.441
Let me go check
with my fearless leaders.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.178
You must be Rusty.

19:59.014 --> 20:00.448
I'm Daniel Dunn.

20:00.482 --> 20:01.582
It's good to
finally meet you.

20:18.115 --> 20:19.489
Sharon: I'm sorry.

20:19.524 --> 20:21.658
He's usually
much more talkative.

20:21.693 --> 20:24.394
Maybe he's overwhelmed,
like me.

20:24.429 --> 20:26.597
Look,
you've raised kids.

20:26.631 --> 20:27.865
How do I
get him to warm up?

20:27.899 --> 20:31.335
Try something positive
about his mother.

20:31.369 --> 20:34.271
He won't admit it,
but he really misses her.

20:34.306 --> 20:35.473
Yeah [Sighs]

20:35.507 --> 20:37.241
I knew her intimately,
not well.

20:37.275 --> 20:39.477
[ Door opens ]
Think of something.

20:39.511 --> 20:43.848
Hey, that was
a pretty great dinner, huh?

20:43.882 --> 20:44.782
Uh, yeah.

20:44.816 --> 20:46.216
Yeah, thanks.

20:46.251 --> 20:49.520
So, uh, tomorrow's
a school day for me,

20:49.555 --> 20:51.389
so I should probably...
I-I'm going, I'm going.

20:51.423 --> 20:53.357
But I-I feel like I talked
so much tonight about myself

20:53.391 --> 20:56.727
that I really didn't get
a chance to hear much about <i>you.</i>

20:56.762 --> 20:59.296
And, also...

20:59.331 --> 21:01.366
You didn't
ask me about your mother.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.501
I thought that
you might find it interesting

21:03.536 --> 21:05.671
to know what she was like
when we were your age.

21:09.175 --> 21:10.175
Oh.

21:11.844 --> 21:15.414
Well, uh...
Sure.

21:16.616 --> 21:18.350
Well, she was, um...

21:18.384 --> 21:20.418
She was a really,
really sweet girl.

21:20.453 --> 21:21.620
She was beautiful.

21:21.654 --> 21:23.188
And she had eyes
exactly like yours.

21:24.356 --> 21:26.658
We met junior year.
She was a new kid in school.

21:26.693 --> 21:29.295
She was really shy at first,
but she had this laugh.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.163
People called it infectious.

21:31.197 --> 21:32.564
I bet she still has it.

21:32.599 --> 21:33.565
Not so much.

21:36.436 --> 21:38.171
Well...

21:38.205 --> 21:39.539
She wasn't at school
very long.

21:39.574 --> 21:41.308
You know, her family
moved around a lot.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.410
Yeah, I never met
my mom's family.

21:43.445 --> 21:45.312
I think...
I think her parents

21:45.346 --> 21:46.613
threw her out
when she got...

21:48.449 --> 21:49.450
you know...

21:49.484 --> 21:51.585
Pregnant with you?

21:51.620 --> 21:52.853
Yeah.

21:55.590 --> 21:56.824
That sucks.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.192
Yeah.

21:58.226 --> 22:00.494
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

22:01.764 --> 22:05.600
Daniel, you went to high school
with Rusty's mom.

22:05.635 --> 22:08.671
Do you have a yearbook that
might have a picture of her?

22:08.705 --> 22:10.239
Oh, my God.
I do.

22:10.273 --> 22:12.875
I do. Oh, my God.
I should have brought that.

22:12.909 --> 22:16.244
You know, Rusty, I could
come back tomorrow, if...

22:16.279 --> 22:18.380
I mean, if you don't mind
having another dinner.

22:21.817 --> 22:23.385
Um...

22:23.419 --> 22:25.687
Yeah, uh...

22:25.722 --> 22:27.422
How about hamburgers?

22:27.457 --> 22:29.891
Rusty knows the best places
to get hamburgers all over L.A.

22:29.926 --> 22:31.226
I love hamburgers.

22:31.260 --> 22:32.494
Yeah, y-you know,

22:32.528 --> 22:34.296
I might have
a lot of homework tomorrow.

22:35.764 --> 22:37.265
I'm not sure yet.

22:38.801 --> 22:41.570
Listen, you've...
you've been nice and all that,

22:41.604 --> 22:43.639
but how do I know
that you're not trying

22:43.673 --> 22:45.641
to create some kind of...

22:45.675 --> 22:46.809
False impression?

22:46.843 --> 22:48.310
False impression?

22:48.344 --> 22:50.245
You're the one
wearing a suit and tie.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.948
Is this how
you always dress for dinner?

22:52.983 --> 22:54.283
I think
I'm beginning to see

22:54.317 --> 22:56.718
some genetic markers
appearing.

22:58.421 --> 23:00.789
Look, Rusty,
there's no pressure.

23:00.823 --> 23:02.357
I'll call you.

23:02.392 --> 23:03.825
If you don't want me
to come back tomorrow,

23:03.860 --> 23:05.594
we'll make our visit
for some other time.

23:05.628 --> 23:06.728
How's that?

23:06.762 --> 23:08.463
Perfect.
Good night, Daniel.

23:08.497 --> 23:09.931
Thank you for
buying us dinner.

23:12.802 --> 23:13.935
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.

23:13.970 --> 23:15.504
No, no, no, thank <i>you.</i>

23:15.538 --> 23:18.440
It was fantastic
spending time with you, Rusty.

23:18.474 --> 23:19.908
It's... it was fantastic.

23:19.942 --> 23:21.877
So, we'll talk tomorrow.

23:27.450 --> 23:30.385
Thank you.
Thank you.

23:30.420 --> 23:31.720
[ Door closes ]

23:34.757 --> 23:35.991
Well?

23:36.025 --> 23:38.360
Why should I trust
anything that he says?

23:38.394 --> 23:39.661
You can't.

23:39.695 --> 23:42.864
But the DNA confirms
he is your father.

23:42.899 --> 23:45.334
He has legal rights.

23:45.368 --> 23:47.003
We can't stall him
forever.

23:48.639 --> 23:53.610
Rusty, you need to get to know
this man.

23:53.644 --> 23:55.979
I know
it's hard to trust him.

23:56.014 --> 23:58.782
Trust <i>me.</i>

23:58.817 --> 24:00.484
I'm on your side.

24:02.454 --> 24:04.722
Well, you sure as hell
aren't on Mike Tao's side.

24:04.756 --> 24:06.490
I'm on the side of
the victim

24:06.524 --> 24:09.926
and of figuring out how to
properly conclude this case

24:09.961 --> 24:11.995
so that we avoid
a civil action.

24:12.029 --> 24:13.730
By pursuing
every little lead

24:13.764 --> 24:15.732
on this
disappearing clown, Zapata,

24:15.767 --> 24:17.067
you make it seem like

24:17.101 --> 24:18.568
Mike screwed this case up
from the beginning.

24:18.603 --> 24:20.404
Lieutenant,
the court decreed

24:20.438 --> 24:22.940
that Lieutenant Tao
put the wrong man in prison,

24:23.007 --> 24:25.476
and Lieutenant Tao
offered to pay

24:25.510 --> 24:28.512
for Mr. Zapata's wife
to be flown in himself.

24:28.547 --> 24:29.947
Look,
just because he asked

24:30.015 --> 24:32.416
[laughing] Doesn't mean
you have to say yes.

24:32.451 --> 24:35.053
You know, sometimes
it's good to say no.

24:36.121 --> 24:38.122
Captain, all I'm asking

24:38.157 --> 24:40.592
is that you back Tao
a little more.

24:40.626 --> 24:41.693
It's not that hard.

24:41.727 --> 24:43.428
I need more information.

24:43.462 --> 24:45.931
For instance, Lieutenant,
maybe you could figure out

24:45.965 --> 24:47.766
why an embezzler
like Zapata

24:47.800 --> 24:50.768
left blood by the sink
of Mr. Reichman's house.

24:50.803 --> 24:52.604
Well, I could think of
a thousand reasons for that.

24:52.638 --> 24:54.739
I don't need
a thousand reasons.

24:54.774 --> 24:55.974
I need <i>one.</i>

24:58.444 --> 25:00.044
Mrs. Zapata,
do you know why your husband

25:00.079 --> 25:02.846
was at Mr. Reichman's house
3rd of April, 2004?

25:02.880 --> 25:04.114
How should I know?

25:04.148 --> 25:06.615
Did he have a reason
to come to Los Angeles?

25:06.650 --> 25:07.683
Probably
chasing a woman.

25:07.718 --> 25:09.452
What woman?

25:09.486 --> 25:11.554
Any woman he could con into
hopping into bed with him.

25:11.588 --> 25:13.389
There were a lot.

25:13.423 --> 25:15.057
Benny never
told me anything.

25:15.091 --> 25:17.927
Even when he was home,
he wasn't home.

25:17.961 --> 25:18.994
Know what I mean?

25:19.029 --> 25:21.530
I do. Yes.

25:21.565 --> 25:22.832
Tao: You didn't know

25:22.866 --> 25:24.533
he was committing
insurance fraud, embezzling?

25:24.568 --> 25:27.903
No. He never gave me anything,
never told me squat.

25:27.938 --> 25:29.939
So why the FBI
keeps on watching me,

25:29.973 --> 25:31.940
I don't know.

25:31.975 --> 25:33.642
Ma'am,
do you have any idea

25:33.676 --> 25:35.944
where your husband has been
the last 81/2 years?

25:35.978 --> 25:38.413
My guess?

25:38.447 --> 25:39.848
While I'm working
for minimum wage

25:39.882 --> 25:41.616
as a cashier at a drug store,

25:41.650 --> 25:43.718
Benny's lying somewhere
on a beach in Central America

25:43.753 --> 25:44.986
next to someone in a bikini.

25:47.789 --> 25:49.657
You want to find my husband,

25:49.691 --> 25:51.726
look for a woman
who disappeared

25:51.760 --> 25:52.827
around the same time
he did.

25:55.030 --> 25:59.066
I think we know someone
who fits that description.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.801
Elaine Reichman.

26:01.836 --> 26:04.138
<i>And how long ago</i>
<i>would Elaine Reichman</i>

26:04.172 --> 26:06.440
<i>have had an account</i>
<i>at our bank?</i>

26:06.474 --> 26:07.674
At least eight years.

26:07.709 --> 26:09.809
Mr. Valdez,
did you get the scan

26:09.843 --> 26:12.679
of the Interpol warrant
for Mr. Benito Zapata?

26:12.713 --> 26:14.681
Because we think
it might be related

26:14.715 --> 26:16.549
to the Elaine Reichman
account.

26:16.584 --> 26:20.620
<i>Sí, sí, sí, I have it,</i>
<i>Special Agent Howard.</i>

26:20.655 --> 26:21.722
<i>Can you see me?</i>
<i>I have it here.</i>

26:21.756 --> 26:23.456
Yes, yes.

26:23.491 --> 26:25.958
<i>Are you at FBI headquarters</i>
<i>in Washington, D.C.?</i>

26:25.993 --> 26:28.194
No, I'm in
the Major Crimes division

26:28.228 --> 26:30.162
of the Los Angeles
police department.

26:30.197 --> 26:33.899
Allow me to introduce
Lieutenant Tao, here.

26:33.933 --> 26:36.135
And now I'm gonna
turn you around, sir,

26:36.169 --> 26:41.873
and show the rest of the
division and where they work.

26:41.907 --> 26:44.642
This is Mr. Valdez
from Banco Nacional.

26:45.911 --> 26:48.179
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>an insurance office.</i>

26:49.281 --> 26:50.548
We agree.

26:50.582 --> 26:52.016
<i>I guess things are</i>

26:52.050 --> 26:54.886
<i>always more exciting</i>
<i>in the movies, huh?</i>

26:54.920 --> 26:56.821
<i>Um, can I have</i>
<i>the name again</i>

<i>and the social security</i>
<i>number?</i>

27:04.986 --> 27:07.188
I'm entering the social now.

27:09.090 --> 27:11.091
<i>Yes. Uh...</i>

27:11.125 --> 27:14.794
Ms. Reichman opened the account
<i>in march of 2004.</i>

27:14.828 --> 27:16.262
Flynn:
In the amount of?!

27:16.296 --> 27:18.931
<i>$1.8 million U.S.</i>

27:18.966 --> 27:21.600
<i>It's worth</i>
<i>quite a bit more now.</i>

27:21.668 --> 27:23.068
<i>Lucky for her,</i>

27:23.102 --> 27:24.535
<i>she stayed away</i>
<i>from the stock market.</i>

27:24.570 --> 27:26.070
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

27:26.104 --> 27:27.138
<i>De nada.</i>

27:27.172 --> 27:28.572
Fritz:
Thank you, Mr. Valdez.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.006
<i>Bye-bye.</i>
<i>We'll get back to you.</i>

27:30.041 --> 27:31.941
I just got off the phone
with the state department.

27:32.009 --> 27:33.909
Mrs. Reichman
renewed her passport

27:33.943 --> 27:35.777
one week
before she was murdered.

27:35.845 --> 27:37.646
She didn't catch Zapata
committing fraud

27:37.680 --> 27:40.181
in her capacity
as an insurance adjuster.

27:40.215 --> 27:41.815
She was helping him.

27:41.849 --> 27:43.950
The couple that feels together
steals together.

27:44.018 --> 27:46.885
They were planning to run off
to sunny Costa Rica.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.221
And Mr. Reichman
found that out somehow.

27:49.956 --> 27:52.957
Well, what have I been saying
all along?

27:52.991 --> 27:54.058
It's always the husband.

27:54.092 --> 27:55.960
It's always the husband.

27:56.028 --> 27:59.229
It's always the husband.
It's always the husband.

27:59.263 --> 28:01.164
And that's why Zapata's blood
was at the scene.

28:01.198 --> 28:03.166
Reichman didn't just
kill his wife.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.234
He also killed her lover.

28:05.269 --> 28:09.205
Zapata isn't a suspect.
He's another victim.

28:18.986 --> 28:20.386
I know we can't
go after Reichman again

28:20.420 --> 28:21.454
for killing his wife,

28:21.488 --> 28:23.122
but, hypothetically,
what if he

28:23.156 --> 28:25.257
killed two people
on the night of April 3, 2004?

28:25.292 --> 28:26.792
Two people?

28:26.827 --> 28:29.795
His wife,
her boyfriend.

28:29.830 --> 28:31.163
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:31.231 --> 28:34.766
You think he stabbed
Zapata to death, too?

28:34.801 --> 28:37.002
Why didn't we
know this before?

28:37.036 --> 28:38.971
Because we had a dead body
right in front of us

28:39.005 --> 28:41.006
and his daughter was
an eye-witness to the murder.

28:41.074 --> 28:42.775
Okay. We didn't think to
look for a second victim.

28:42.809 --> 28:44.743
I understand that.
But, hypothetically,

28:44.778 --> 28:46.745
how did Reichman manage
to pull off two murders

28:46.779 --> 28:48.480
and dispose of one body
in just 20 minutes?

28:48.514 --> 28:50.949
Architects are
good planners.

28:50.983 --> 28:54.353
Maybe his original design
was to get rid of both bodies.

28:54.420 --> 28:58.356
The one thing he didn't plan on
was his daughter waking up.

28:58.424 --> 29:00.925
And how do you propose to find
this second victim?

29:00.960 --> 29:02.994
Lydia.
