20:22.192 --> 20:24.794
You know what's the
biggest luxury?

20:24.928 --> 20:26.529
Pooping when
no one's home.

20:26.630 --> 20:28.564
(Ilana)
Oh, my God, yes, especially
when it's not your own house.

20:28.665 --> 20:29.865
(Abbi)
Wait, what?

20:29.966 --> 20:31.801
(woman)
Hey!

20:31.902 --> 20:34.537
You guys can't be here
if you don't have dogs!

20:34.638 --> 20:36.939
We have dogs!
We got dogs!

20:37.140 --> 20:38.708
Where are your dogs?

20:38.842 --> 20:41.310
Where are your dogs?

20:41.478 --> 20:43.412
Right here!

20:45.415 --> 20:46.515
Well, all right.

20:46.616 --> 20:48.718
Just...
Yeah, well, great.

20:48.819 --> 20:50.753
Happy-- I'm so
happy for you.

20:50.921 --> 20:52.888
You know, we're not
gonna molest your dogs!

20:53.056 --> 20:55.224
Unless we were dogs!
