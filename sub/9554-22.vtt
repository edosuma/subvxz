I still don't know
why Richie had to stay up

01:34.795 --> 01:36.673
all night studying--
I mean, it was only a quiz.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.174
He wants to keep
his grade average up.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.509
He doesn't want to get a

01:39.533 --> 01:41.111
What do you mean?
For a "C,"

01:41.135 --> 01:42.705
I'd sell my grandmother
to the gypsies.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.715
I like your grandmother.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.151
- Yeah, Tillie's all right.
- RICHIE: Hey! Guys!

01:48.175 --> 01:50.153
Guys, come here!
Come on, come on!

01:50.177 --> 01:51.655
- What?
- Outside. I saw...

01:51.679 --> 01:53.456
Up in the sky!
It was fantastic!

01:53.480 --> 01:56.026
It's a flying saucer!
Come on, you got to see it!

01:56.050 --> 01:57.861
- It's great! Come on, everybody!
- POTSIE: Flying saucer?

01:57.885 --> 01:59.023
(Snaps fingers)

02:03.891 --> 02:05.402

(Snaps fingers)

02:09.896 --> 02:12.075
Yeah, Fonz?

02:12.099 --> 02:13.910
Oh... it's getting worse!

02:13.934 --> 02:16.413
Now I'm getting chubby men!

02:16.437 --> 02:19.582
Boy, I don't care
if he is our best friend,

02:19.606 --> 02:22.218
-he's cracking up!
-(laughter)

02:22.242 --> 02:23.920
What do you mean?
What's cracking up?

02:23.944 --> 02:25.655
Who's cracking up?
What's going on here?

02:25.679 --> 02:29.092
I think Richie's wah, wah, wah
has gone woo, woo, woo.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.027
(laughter)

02:31.051 --> 02:33.730
POTSIE:
Hey, Rich! Rich, tell Fonz.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.065
I dare you.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.333
- Yeah, yeah, tell him, nutso.
-(laughter)

02:37.357 --> 02:39.202
All right, hold it, stop.
That's enough.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.905
I don't want to hear nothing
about my buddy Richie.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.274
'Cause what he says,
you believe.

02:44.298 --> 02:47.510
You think that
this face right here lies?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.879
Fonz, I just saw
a flying saucer.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.915
Hey, what are you, nutso?

02:51.939 --> 02:54.551
- Did you see any
little green men? -(laughter)

02:54.575 --> 02:56.252
Look, look,
the man's obviously overtired.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.722
Too much studying.
You better get some sleep, Rich.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.691
I'm telling you,
I saw a flying saucer.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.426
Uh, Rich,
this happens all the time

03:03.450 --> 03:06.062
to people that
live humdrum lives.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.732
- Humdrum? -Yeah. When you
got nothing else going

03:08.756 --> 03:11.367
in your life, your brain
kind of exaggerates, you know?

03:11.391 --> 03:13.303
Now, wait a minute,
I'm not humdrum.

03:13.327 --> 03:16.172
I may be a little tired,
but I... I'm not humdrum.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.875
You're not humdrum, huh?
What do you do with your nights?

03:18.899 --> 03:21.111
All right, fine.
I-l come home,

03:21.135 --> 03:22.412
- I eat dinner...
- Yeah.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.680
- Do my homework...
- Yeah.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.048
Watch a little TV,

03:25.072 --> 03:26.783
uh, Friday nights
I play basketball,

03:26.807 --> 03:29.619
Saturday nights I go on a date,
Sunday nights I rest.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.930
Well, here I am...

04:13.954 --> 04:16.867
eating leftovers, watching TV.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.837
I don't know,
maybe I am humdrum.

(knocking)

04:26.400 --> 04:28.107
Oh. Come in.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.788
Uh...

04:38.812 --> 04:40.256
hi, Ralph.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.325
Great Alvin the chipmunk
imitation.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.928
Now, come on in and sit down.
I'm trying to watch this show.

Boop...!

04:53.160 --> 04:54.867
Good evening, earthling.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.347
You're not Ralph.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.516
(speaks alien language)

05:06.540 --> 05:09.719
Now, wait a minute,
a-are you...

05:09.743 --> 05:11.287
I was right! You're...

05:11.311 --> 05:13.523
Did you say... "earthling"?

05:13.547 --> 05:14.525
(speaks alien language)

05:15.549 --> 05:16.793
Are you an alien?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.628

- All right, put 'em up!

05:18.652 --> 05:20.864
- Boop...!
- Yeah, right, cancel that.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.699
Right, now, just, uh...

05:22.723 --> 05:24.701
just-just take it easy,
all right?

05:24.725 --> 05:27.203
I mean, just-just stay...
very calm, because, uh...

05:27.227 --> 05:29.405
I come in peace.
No, no, you're the one.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.374
You-you come in peace. I...

05:31.398 --> 05:33.910
Look, will you just calm down?
Calm down for one second!

05:33.934 --> 05:37.447
Relax, earthling.
I mean you no harm.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.815
Oh.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.885
Sure. How am I supposed to know?

05:41.909 --> 05:44.888
(speaking alien language)

05:44.912 --> 05:49.359
What do you do, do you just, uh,
use that to scare people with?

05:49.383 --> 05:51.090
No, keeps rain off my head.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.298
Are you Richie Cunningham?

05:55.322 --> 05:57.700
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, th-that's me.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.270
- Is this your house?
- Uh-huh.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.296
Eh-eh, eh-eh.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.409
Wait a minute, who are you?

06:06.433 --> 06:09.107
I am Mork from Ork.
(speaks alien language)

06:10.671 --> 06:12.947
(speaks alien language)

06:17.144 --> 06:20.421
A-And those guys
said I was crazy.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.059
Hey, hey, I just...

06:23.083 --> 06:25.628
I... I got the best idea.
I want to show those guys, see?

06:25.652 --> 06:27.230
Will you come down
to Arnold's with me?

06:27.254 --> 06:29.766
-(speaks alien language)
- Oh.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.901
Right, right.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.737
Hey, if you're Mork from Ork...

06:34.761 --> 06:37.106
then I got
a tremendous scoop here!

06:37.130 --> 06:38.508
- Scoop?
- Uh, story.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.976
News story.
Uh, look, would you mind

06:40.000 --> 06:41.678
if I just ask you
a few questions?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.079
Fire away, bucko.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.515
Bucko. That's great.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.517
- Okay, would you just
mind having a seat? -Seat?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.953
- Yes.
-(speaking alien language)

06:57.684 --> 06:59.495
Mork, you...

06:59.519 --> 07:02.131
you know my nickname,
you know where I live--

07:02.155 --> 07:04.300
you don't even know how to sit?

07:04.324 --> 07:06.970
See, you just...
you put your, uh... down.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.838
Oh. (speaks alien language)

07:08.862 --> 07:12.342
-(beeping, whirring)
- Ah...

07:12.366 --> 07:14.243
Good.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.547
Okay, your name is, uh, Mork,

07:17.571 --> 07:20.216
and you come
from the planet Ork.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.720
Ever been to New York?
(chuckles)

07:25.479 --> 07:27.357
Just a little Earth humor.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.925
Oh, humor.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.760
(loudly):
Ah, ah!

07:30.784 --> 07:32.729
(laughs):
That's it.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.464
All right.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.468
What is that yellow stick?

07:37.491 --> 07:39.302
Oh, this is just a pencil.

07:39.326 --> 07:42.672
Uh, oh, it's what we use
to write with. What do you use?

07:42.696 --> 07:45.975
I use this. I can also use it
as a weapon to immobilize you.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.711
- Not now. (chuckles)
-(sighs)

07:48.735 --> 07:51.848
I can also point with it.
I can scratch with it.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.851
I can call people with it.
Hey, you, come here.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.253
Unique, isn't it?

07:57.277 --> 07:59.689
What is the purpose
of your visit to Earth?

07:59.713 --> 08:00.857
Purpose. Recall.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.258
(beeping, sputtering)

08:02.282 --> 08:04.761
Ah. I am here on your planet
to collect specimens

08:04.785 --> 08:06.596
for assembling on our planet.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.965
- No kidding?
-(speaks alien language)

08:08.989 --> 08:10.333
Anybody in particular?

08:10.357 --> 08:11.401
Yes.

08:11.425 --> 08:13.169
What, the president?!

08:13.193 --> 08:15.705
Oh, no, no, no,
not in Milwaukee. Uh...

08:15.729 --> 08:17.807
Are you gonna take Hank Aaron?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.410
Hank Aaron? (imitates bat
cracking, cheering) No, no.

08:20.434 --> 08:21.944
He is too famous.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.447
We would have to trade
the entire planet for him.

08:24.471 --> 08:27.550
- Oh. -What we need
is someone average.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.053
Humdrum.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.784
I know somebody humdrum.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.838
<i>RICHIE:
No, no, I-I can't go.</i>

08:48.862 --> 08:50.940
<i>I... Well, I can't
just leave like that.</i>

08:50.964 --> 08:52.341
Oh, it will
only take an instant.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.443
I'll bring you right back.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.710
Just an instant?

08:54.734 --> 08:56.079
(beeps)

08:56.103 --> 08:58.014
-I-I'll be back, just like that?
-(snaps fingers)

08:58.038 --> 09:00.450
Zabadee.

09:00.474 --> 09:03.920
- Just a zabadee?
-(speaks alien language)

09:03.944 --> 09:06.322
All right.
All right, what could it hurt?

09:06.346 --> 09:07.857
- I'm gonna go. I...
- Ah.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.792
All right, I-l got
to get some clothes.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.828
Uh, what do the men wear on Ork?

09:11.852 --> 09:14.097
Uh, same thing
our females do. Nothing.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.965
Females wear nothing?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.733
- Mm.
- What do they look like?

09:17.757 --> 09:19.302
- Ee-ee, ee-ee.
- Oh.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.338
Would you like to see
a picture of me and my girl?

09:22.362 --> 09:23.606
Yeah. Sure.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.234
Deebee.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.245
Oh, uh... which one is you?

09:29.269 --> 09:30.613
- Can't you tell?
- No.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.882
- That's why we don't bother
with clothes. -Oh.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.184
All right, uh... no clothes.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.587
So, I got to get a camera,
all right?

09:37.611 --> 09:39.021
And, uh, some film.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.124
I need more paper
and some pencils.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.259
See, I can't do that
with my finger the way you can.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.261
- Pity.
- Yeah.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.230
Would you mind if I just went
to my room and got that stuff?

09:47.254 --> 09:49.132
-(speaking alien language)
- Oh, fine. Thanks a lot.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.701
Oh, uh, listen,
just make yourself comfortable.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.069
You got the TV there.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.437
Oh, well, you broke that.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.838
No. Can repair instantly.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.273
(beep, music plays on TV)

09:57.297 --> 09:58.608
- Oh, very good!
-(speaks alien language)

09:58.632 --> 09:59.876
All right, and you got some food
there, too, all right?

09:59.900 --> 10:03.712
Food? Ah, fidba. Yay.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.015
(muttering)

10:06.039 --> 10:08.076
Needs salt.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.360
after these messages.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.092
I like that boy, Opie.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.806
Why does an Earth boy have
a Martian name, though?

10:30.830 --> 10:32.441
(indistinct voices on TV)

10:32.465 --> 10:34.610
- Well, I didn't like it.
- I liked it. I liked it.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.705
- No, I didn't like it.
- Well, it was so-so.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.508
It wasn't worth
the full price ticket.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.655
MARION:
Oh, my.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.191
Well, hello. Uh, you must be
a friend of Richard's.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.659
(grunts softly)

10:49.683 --> 10:51.661
Oh, I'm Howard Cunningham,
Richard's father,

10:51.685 --> 10:54.564
and this is Mrs. Cunningham
and our daughter Joanie.

10:54.588 --> 10:56.033
- JOANIE: Hi.
- I am Mork from Ork.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.334
Oh, thank you.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.773
Oh, I... Yes, O-R-K.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.441
- MORK: O-R-K.
- Yes.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.976
Well, Richard pledged A.T.0.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.678
He didn't have a suit like that.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.247
- MORK: Oh.
- No. They stuck feathers on him.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.081
I like feathers,
but I find them fattening.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.450
Oh, brother.

11:18.878 --> 11:22.091
He's another Ralph Malph.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.759
Uh, won't you make yourself
comfortable?

11:23.783 --> 11:25.785
Oh, thank you.

11:29.723 --> 11:33.402
Uh, well, I think
I'll just turn off the TV set.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.837
(high-pitched beeping)

11:36.763 --> 11:39.875
Jiminy Crickets,
there goes the TV again!

11:39.899 --> 11:41.244
Oh, dear.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.279
Uh, would you like something
to drink?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.081
Do you have any Pingee?

11:45.105 --> 11:47.183
MARION:
Pingee?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.018
It is a soft drink on Ork.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.386
Comes in five delicious flavors:

11:50.410 --> 11:53.789
Taz, Mah, Sheezba, Baba
and Shishwannee.

11:53.813 --> 11:57.159
Well, Mom, why don't you get
a case of Shishwannee?

11:57.183 --> 11:58.894
No, dear, it gives you cavities.

11:58.918 --> 11:59.895
Cavities.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.330
(loudly):
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

12:01.354 --> 12:03.356
(stifled grunting)

12:08.061 --> 12:10.573
I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

12:10.597 --> 12:14.110
(loudly): Richard, will you come
down here right away, please?

12:14.134 --> 12:16.045
Oh, Dad.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.847
Oh, Mom, good,
I'm glad you're here.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.549
Oh, a lot has happened
since the last time I saw you.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.518
I mean, I... well, I don't even
know where to start.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.986
I know where to start.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.388
You'll start with him.
Where did you find him?

12:25.412 --> 12:26.889
- Yeah, where did he come from?
-(overlapping chatter)

12:26.913 --> 12:28.357
What kind of man
did you bring in...?

12:28.381 --> 12:29.759
(high-pitched):
Boop...!

12:29.783 --> 12:30.793
Why did you do that?

12:30.817 --> 12:32.296
He drew first.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.769
Well, are they gonna be
all right?

12:39.793 --> 12:41.203
The effects wear off very soon.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.471
(low humming)

12:42.495 --> 12:44.540
Now we must hurry.
We do not have much time.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.109
All right. Okay, I just want
to make some, uh, sandwiches

12:47.133 --> 12:48.377
for the trip, okay?

12:48.401 --> 12:51.914
Do you have some of that
Earth delicacy, baloney?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.183
Uh, baloney? Well,
I-I'm not sure, but I'll check.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.744
We need it for fuel.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.090
Uh, how long are
we gonna be gone, anyway?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.658
Uh, about a bleem.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.926
Uh, a-a bleem.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.661
Okay, well how long
would that be in Earth time?

13:05.685 --> 13:07.196
- You know, a day, a week...
- Uh, Earth time.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.197
(electric beeping)

13:08.221 --> 13:09.962
2,000 years.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.647
Stop, Earth specimen.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.717
-(high-pitched): Eep!
-(pulsing)

13:27.741 --> 13:31.420
Shazbot, I missed.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.289
No one has ever
escaped from Mork.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.357
Think humdrum.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.492
Humdrum, humdrum, humdrum.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.086
(pulsing)

13:40.620 --> 13:43.065
<i>RICHIE: Fonz, I got to talk
to you; it's life and death.</i>

13:43.089 --> 13:44.166
What's up?

13:44.190 --> 13:45.835
Fonz, a guy's after me.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.532
Mork from Ork.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.507
I don't know him;
must be from the east side.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.775
No, no, no east side.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.009
I mean this is, uh,

13:54.033 --> 13:56.178
north through the Milky Way
and hang a right.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.381
It's a spacemen, Fonzie,
and he's after me.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.282
He's...

14:00.306 --> 14:01.984
A spaceman after you?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.319
What does he want with you?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.520
Because I'm average.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.788
- I told you.
- Yeah, I know.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.022
You're right.
He said I'm humdrum,

14:07.046 --> 14:08.391
-and that's why he wants me.
- Yeah.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.059
He wants to take me
in his spaceship.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.495
Oh, make sure you get
a, uh, window seat.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.662
(laughs)

14:13.686 --> 14:15.398
Fonz, I'm not joking
around here.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.267
Yeah, it must be serious, 'cause
why else would you tempt fate?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.202
That's right, it's serious.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.104
He wants to take me
away for a bleem--

14:22.128 --> 14:23.239
that's 2,000 years.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.941
Mr. Cunningham, you are
holding on to my jacket.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.544
- Well, what should I do?
- Let go of my jacket.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.080
Hey, that's much better.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.382
Now, because you're a friend
of mine, I'll check him out.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.651
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah. A bleem, huh?

14:35.675 --> 14:37.453
-2,000 years.
- Get out of here.

Oh, wait.

Fonz, hey.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.614
Fonz, you see,
it's that finger of his.

15:05.638 --> 15:06.949
- Hey...
- He just points it once,

15:06.973 --> 15:08.384

15:12.946 --> 15:14.290
you're packing, huh?

15:14.314 --> 15:17.092
Now, maybe we can work this out,
just you and me, you know?

15:17.116 --> 15:18.461
What is there to work out?

15:18.485 --> 15:19.862
It is settled.
Come along, specimen.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.730
Uh, wait a minute,
let me tell you something.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.065
You ain't taking my buddy here.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.167
You got to get through me first.

15:25.191 --> 15:28.798
Oh, splendid. A Holitacker.
I love a Holitacker.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.141
What is a Holitacker?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.943
In your language, specimen,
it is a challenge.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.645
If your champion defeats me,
you do not have to go with me.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.813
All right,
let me get this straight.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.182
If I win, you don't take
the specimen here.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.450
You read me, creature.

Rumble?

15:50.850 --> 15:53.362

(imitates a high-pitched horn)

15:54.888 --> 15:56.932
(imitates roaring crowd)

15:56.956 --> 15:59.134
Then we must introduce
the local celebrities.

15:59.158 --> 16:02.765
(speaking high-pitched
alien language)

16:04.964 --> 16:06.475
Can we get on with this, now?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.811
Anytime you're ready.

16:08.835 --> 16:12.181
I have been challenged on
200 planets. I am undefeated.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.216
So am I.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.518
Yeah, that's right.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.120
Fonzie's never lost
a Holitacker yet.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.385
Yeah, and we got
the home planet advantage.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.629
Just count to three,
then, specimen.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.730
All right.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.764
Get him, Fonz.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.633
One, two, three!

16:30.657 --> 16:34.637
Eep! No contest.
Let's go, specimen.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.606
Wait a minute.
Fonzie, he can't just...

16:37.630 --> 16:39.308
Well...

16:39.332 --> 16:40.576
Oh, Fonz, I'm sorry.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.978
I guess the finger
was just too much.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
Oh.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.722
So long, buddy.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.492
Let's go.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.927
Hey, wait a minute, wait.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.662
Look at his thumb.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.797
See what he's doing
with his thumb?

17:01.821 --> 17:04.199
Impossible. This has
never happened before.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.363
Yeah, well, you never ran up
against the Fonz before, bucko.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.702
Aaayyh.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.887
So, at last, a worthy opponent.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.622
(buzzes)

17:26.646 --> 17:28.257
(electric crackling)

17:28.281 --> 17:31.760
RICHIE:
Oh, what a great story.

17:31.784 --> 17:35.561
Fonzie's thumb saving us
from that deadly alien finger.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.535
- Uncle.
- Yeah.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.104
Would you like to try
for the next plateau?

17:42.128 --> 17:43.739
Anything you say, Jack.

All right, all right,
it's a draw! It's a draw!

18:10.623 --> 18:12.968
The jukebox was a draw.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.994
Can your champion
do this, specimen?

18:18.231 --> 18:20.233
- Eep!
-(pulsing)

18:29.509 --> 18:31.420
Aha.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.614
(blows)

18:41.888 --> 18:44.333
Good going, Fonz.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.701
So you want a good one.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.727
Watch this.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.776
Eep!

18:53.800 --> 18:55.811
Nee-nee, nee-nee,
nee-nee, nee-nee.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.947
Now, try this.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.278

19:12.785 --> 19:14.563
No, wait, Fonz. No, not her.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.331
All right, all right.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.357
(Snaps fingers)

19:19.926 --> 19:21.530
Interesting.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.674
- Eep.
-(pulsing)

19:34.273 --> 19:35.911
- All right, I'll give you
that one. -FONZIE: Yeah.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.079
How about a little
target practice, then?

19:41.481 --> 19:43.759
(grunts)

19:43.783 --> 19:45.761
- Eep!

20:03.336 --> 20:04.847
You give up now?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.249
Nothing can top this.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.151
I put my two fingers together,

20:09.175 --> 20:10.953
and the entire
building collapses.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.621
-(hums) -Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute!

20:12.645 --> 20:14.890
What are you talking about,
the whole building collapses?

20:14.914 --> 20:17.593
It's fantastic-- screams,
Technicolor, everything.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.728
What about the people
in the building?

20:19.752 --> 20:22.364
Wrecks them pretty bad,
kills a few, too.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.899
Well, you're in here,
too, you know.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.601
That's part of the fun.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.770
Must be a pretty tough bugger.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.338
No, not a question of toughness.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.507
I am protected by a stellar
force field. Watch.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.242
-(buzzes)
-(mouthing words)

20:33.266 --> 20:35.143
Xbuzzes)
.see?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.916
-(humming) -Fonzie, you can't
let him collapse the building.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.918
All right, all right, ho,
whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.387
Just stop.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.755
You admit defeat?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.781
Yeah, all right, you w...

20:51.651 --> 20:54.797
You w...

20:54.821 --> 20:56.231
- Tell him.
- Win.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.432
Yeah.

20:57.456 --> 20:59.334
Good.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.636
I'll go peacefully.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.904
No, not necessary.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.039
This is the best contest
I've had in 20 bleems.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.941
The only reason I won
is because your champion

21:05.965 --> 21:07.676
cared about
his earthling friends.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.744
Funny thing, this warmth.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.145
We don't have it on Ork.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.247
We tried it once
a long time ago. Didn't work.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.409
Overpopulation.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.685
Now I must leave
your planet Earth.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.587
But I tip my kripla to you, sir.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.181
(squeaks)

21:22.515 --> 21:24.726
You're telling me that, uh,

21:24.750 --> 21:27.496
you're not taking
my pal here, right?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.598
Well, I tip
my krila to you, too.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.134
(monotone squeak)

21:32.158 --> 21:33.669
Thank you.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.370
Thank you for not taking me.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.072
Oh, I'm not taking you,
I'm taking him.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.273
Hey, get out of here.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.641
-(high-pitched tone)
-(pulsing)

21:39.665 --> 21:41.410
We need a new champion on Ork.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.345
We must now enter the time warp.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.881
(deeply, slowly): We must now
enter the time warp.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.149
Hey, wait! No, wait!

21:47.173 --> 21:48.951
You're not taking Fonzie.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.886
No, I can't let you do... do it!

21:50.910 --> 21:52.487
Why are you taking him?

21:52.511 --> 21:54.022
You don't...
I mean, he's very...

21:54.046 --> 21:56.091
Fonz, don't let him
take you like that.

21:56.115 --> 21:59.561
Please, Fonzie, don't let him!
You could stop him!

21:59.585 --> 22:02.191
(deeply, slowly):
Whoa.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.336
Fonzie?

22:07.360 --> 22:09.204
Fonz!

22:09.228 --> 22:10.505
Oh.

22:10.529 --> 22:13.375
Don't take him! No, please!

22:13.399 --> 22:14.610
Please, don't take the Fonz!

22:14.634 --> 22:15.811
No, please don't take Fonzie!

22:15.835 --> 22:17.212
- Please!
- Richard?

22:17.236 --> 22:18.881
- I'll get you some baloney!
- Richard, wake up.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.382
- If you want baloney, I'll...
- Wake up, son.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.384
What? What?

22:22.408 --> 22:24.720
Oh, you'd better
go on up to bed, dear.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.855
You fell asleep
on the couch. Come on.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.358
No, wait, see, I-l...

22:29.382 --> 22:31.593
I came home right after
I saw the flying saucer.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.862
(laughs) Another crackpot.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.364
A lot of people
thought they saw it.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.498
It was a weather balloon.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.367
We heard it on the radio
on the way home.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.202
Oh, but this was so real.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.970
And then... and then
he came down here,

22:41.994 --> 22:43.672
and he wanted to take me,
but no.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.207
No, see, I escaped to Arnold's.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.109
And then... and then,
he and Fonzie were dueling.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.944
Mork and the Fonz,
and it was a... you know,

22:48.968 --> 22:51.346
the gun versus the thumb
and the finger, and... (buzzes)

22:51.370 --> 22:53.548
- It must have been some dream.
- It was.

22:53.572 --> 22:55.284
- Good night, Richie.
- Good night, Richard.

22:55.308 --> 22:57.219
Such a cute dream, dear.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.821
You have such
a good imagination.

22:59.845 --> 23:01.490
But, uh...

23:01.514 --> 23:04.324
When I was your age,
I used to dream about girls.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.797
I'll tell you one thing.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.966
I'll settle for humdrum
any day, now.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.267
- Good night, Richard.
- Night.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.602
(knocking)

23:13.626 --> 23:15.833
Oh, don't worry, I'll get it.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.108
(sighs)

23:20.132 --> 23:21.743
Uh, excuse me, um...

23:21.767 --> 23:23.545
<i>Mark'. You're Mark'.!</i>

23:23.569 --> 23:26.682
Dad, Dad, he's...
This is Mork!

23:26.706 --> 23:28.317
HOWARD:
Good night, Richard.

23:28.341 --> 23:29.618
Yeah, but he's gonna
take me away!

23:29.642 --> 23:31.887
Don't you care? If you...

23:31.911 --> 23:34.089
All right, fine, you don't care.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.624
I'll be gone for about a bleem.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.492
MARION:
Wear something warm.

23:37.516 --> 23:38.593
RICHIE:
Let's go.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.062
Oh, that's all right.
I was lost.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.831
I was looking for directions
to highway 41, but that's okay.

23:42.855 --> 23:43.865
- No, but you're...
- I'll just...

23:43.889 --> 23:45.600
I'll just close the door
real slow.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.467
No loud noises, okay?

24:02.475 --> 24:04.720
Hey, uh, what'd you get
on the Spanish quiz, Ralph?

24:04.744 --> 24:06.121
I passed.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.756
Well, I got a B-plus.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.125
You see, now that's why
I stay up all night studying.

24:10.149 --> 24:13.662
I flunked. But I'm well-rested.

24:13.686 --> 24:17.099
Okay, everybody, closing time.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.967
Everybody out!

24:18.991 --> 24:20.902
Hey, guys. guys!

24:20.926 --> 24:23.338
O-Outside, you won't
believe what I just saw!

24:23.362 --> 24:25.374
- Another flying saucer.
-(laughs)

24:25.398 --> 24:28.777
Better. The Hooper triplets
got new sweaters.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.781
- Come on, everybody, let's go!
- All right!

24:32.738 --> 24:35.384
That's the fastest
I've ever closed.
