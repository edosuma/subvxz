WEBVTT

00:34.909 --> 00:39.581
And the employee of the month is...

00:46.379 --> 00:48.590
Ah, look here. I'm sorry, folks.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.342
My breakfast burrito's
fixin' to say adios.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.345
What say we finish this ceremony
in my back office.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.601
Our employee
of the month is Hank Hill.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.978
Congratulations, Hank.
That's 41 times in a row.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.981
Uh, thank you, sir.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.984
I wish you could see
the expression on my face.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.569
- Okeydoke.
- But you can't.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.237
Meeting adjourned, y'all.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.656
Finally.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.951
- Oh. Oh, hey. One more thing, Hank.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.705
We need to hire
a new accessories associate.

01:21.247 --> 01:24.334
Well, I'll put together a short list
of candidates for you.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.461
Ho. You're the quarterback
of this panty raid.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.629
You make the pick.

01:27.629 --> 01:31.424
You want me to choose the next member
of Team Strickland?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.052
Well, this is a heck of an honor, Buck.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.512
- Don't let me down, Hank.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.555
You do, it'll be like spitting in my face

01:37.639 --> 01:39.390
41 times in a row.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.482
Are you married?

01:47.482 --> 01:50.235
My wife passed away two years ago.

01:50.693 --> 01:51.736
That's good, Bobby.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.071
Keep throwing me curveballs.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.072
Ask another one.

01:54.572 --> 01:57.367
Well, here's one that gets
at the heart of the matter.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.452
We're all Christians here.

01:59.994 --> 02:00.912
How about you?

02:00.912 --> 02:03.748
Hank, you can't ask
that question in an interview.

02:03.832 --> 02:04.958
It's against the law.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.670
You can't ask about age, race,
religion or sexual affiliation.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.881
Well, it's the legal equivalent
of asking a woman how much she weighs.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.342
Why don't you just hire me, Dad?

02:14.884 --> 02:16.386
That's good, son.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.221
Keep throwing those curveballs.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.306
If you could eat at Luly's

02:20.390 --> 02:21.850
with one of the following

02:21.850 --> 02:24.686
would it be A. Jesus

02:25.353 --> 02:26.938
B. Mohammed.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.732
C. Golda Meir.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.069
Uh, I, I don't eat at Luly's.
They use lard.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.697
Hmm. Okay.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.824
- Uh, Mr. Herrington.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.119
You seem to have a few gaps here
in your work history.

02:41.119 --> 02:47.083
Well, '33 to '45, F.D.R.
was in the White House

02:47.167 --> 02:49.836
so I was on the welfare, you know.

02:50.420 --> 02:55.008
And in the '60s,
you had Kennedy and L.B.J.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.843
so I was on the welfare.

02:56.843 --> 03:00.972
And then from '77 to '81, Jimmy Carter

03:00.972 --> 03:02.974
so I was on the welfare.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.936
Dale, what are you doing here?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.272
I have killed all the bugs in Arlen.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.400
It is time for me
to take on new challenges.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.236
My resume... A.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.782
1984 to present.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.869
Gribble and Sons Propane, Yuma, Arizona?

03:23.244 --> 03:25.955
Dale, I've known you
since we were in first grade.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.333
You don't know me.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.959
I am unknowable.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.129
Mario Montalvo.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.799
My name is Maria.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.301
Oh, my.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.844
I'm terribly sorry.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.765
You have to understand
this job requires a certain comfort level

03:43.765 --> 03:46.684
with barbecues so I just assumed
this was a typo.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.561
Ah, let me double-check.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.562
Mario?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.439
There is no man named Mario.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.234
There is only I, a woman named Maria.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.486
Huh. Well, how do you like that. Huh.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.863
As I walked through
your accessories department

03:58.947 --> 04:01.908
I could not help noticing you
feature the Vogner Char King.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.284
You know about the King?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.828
Dual side grills, three center racks

04:06.287 --> 04:09.415
35,000 B.T.U.S of propane-powered fury.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.293
As an accessories associate,
it is my job to know.

04:12.794 --> 04:16.297
Well, uh, your qualifications
are impressive,

04:16.381 --> 04:18.758
but I do have one last puzzler.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.760
Ms. Montalvo,

04:20.760 --> 04:23.596
you're at the Troy Aikman
fantasy sports camp.

04:23.972 --> 04:28.101
It's the toughest 14 days you'll ever love
and on the bus ride home...

04:28.101 --> 04:29.060
Excuse me.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.395
Who's Troy Aikman?

04:33.523 --> 04:35.984
On the one hand,
she booted the Aikman question.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.319
On the other,
she knew about the Char King.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.990
Wh-when you say "she",
are you talking about a woman?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.951
Yes, Bill. Maria Montalvo.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.370
Maria Montalvo?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.414
I worked with her in Arizona.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.124
She's no darn good.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.126
Yeah, well, these days,
you got to be careful

04:53.126 --> 04:55.837
about working with a girl... uh, woman.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.256
Why, in the army,
you can get in big trouble

04:58.256 --> 04:59.507
for harassing a woman

04:59.841 --> 05:01.759
even if you're her superior officer.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.344
Yeah, man, I tell you what, man.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.054
You go to work with a woman nowadays, man.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.098
You gotta pull duty like Kathleen Willey

05:07.098 --> 05:08.975
Slick Willy, man. Dang ol' Willy Wonka,

05:09.142 --> 05:10.184
wonk, wonk, wonk, wonk.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.062
Well, she's more qualified
than any other applicant,

05:13.146 --> 05:14.939
but that only goes so far. I mean,

05:15.023 --> 05:17.150
what are we going to talk about?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.484
Our feelings?

05:22.280 --> 05:24.824
Peggy, there's something
I've got to tell you.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.659
I interviewed a woman today and

05:27.327 --> 05:30.121
apparently, she's very handsome.

05:30.955 --> 05:34.250
She's also extremely
well-qualified and sharp as a tack.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.711
But don't worry.
I'm not going to hire her.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.546
Why would I worry? I feel for her.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.340
If people had been afraid to hire me

05:40.340 --> 05:42.091
because I'm pretty and smart

05:42.175 --> 05:44.427
I would have never gotten
where I am today.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.264
I just don't know what
the rules are anymore, Peggy.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.850
If Bob Cecil made a big sale,

05:50.850 --> 05:53.311
I could give him a pat
on the back or something.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.231
How can I do that with Maria Montalvo?

05:57.315 --> 05:58.775
Oh, please, honey.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.860
Women are nothing to be afraid of.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.612
Just give her a hug.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.698
- Just put your arms around her like this.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.619
I don't know, Peg. What if she gets
her cheek up against mine like this?

06:10.119 --> 06:10.995
Hmm.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.081
Well, in that case

06:13.081 --> 06:15.416
you can just start to struggle politely

06:16.084 --> 06:17.043
like this.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.477
We'll keep your resume
on file, Ms. Montalvo.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.237
Hi. I came about your ad.

06:44.737 --> 06:45.988
My name's Leon Petard.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.949
Hey, cowboys. All right.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.202
Leon, you just answered
my first six questions.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.704
There's just one more thing
I'd like to know.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.957
What do you think of propane?

06:56.999 --> 06:58.251
Well, sir... Whew!

06:58.251 --> 06:59.752
I probably shouldn't say this

06:59.836 --> 07:01.671
because it sounds kind of crazy.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.757
- But after God, country and family,

07:04.882 --> 07:09.011
what I love most is propane
and propane paraphernalia.

07:10.096 --> 07:14.058
Son, if that's crazy,
you've just walked into a funny farm.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.185
- Welcome to the team.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.188
<i>Leon's perfect, Peggy.</i>

07:19.272 --> 07:22.275
He's like Bobby
without all that stuff Bobby does.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.861
Yeah, but what about that woman
you were going to hire?

07:24.861 --> 07:27.697
You said she was the most
qualified of the whole bunch.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.658
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I passed her over.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.537
- So you were attracted to her.
- What?

07:34.537 --> 07:37.373
Oh, you must think she's one hot tamale

07:37.457 --> 07:39.459
if you couldn't even stand
to have her in the office.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.752
Peggy, I didn't hire her. She's gone.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.129
I'll never see her again.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.506
Uh-huh. Except when you
close your eyes and kiss me, right?

07:45.631 --> 07:46.841
Is that what you're saying?

08:09.614 --> 08:10.656
Leon, where have you been?

08:10.740 --> 08:12.033
You're over three hours late.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.701
I wasn't late. I was early.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.537
I got here at... what time do we open?

08:16.621 --> 08:17.622
8:00.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.458
Yeah, I got here at 7:00,
and you weren't here,

08:20.458 --> 08:21.959
so I went to get some coffee, right?

08:22.418 --> 08:25.087
But the waitress, uh,
it turns out her dog was sick,

08:25.171 --> 08:28.716
so I thought, hey,
if I take her dog to the vet,

08:28.716 --> 08:30.426
she might buy some propane.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.178
You know, from us.

08:32.762 --> 08:36.015
So there's this line at the vet
because of this farm accident.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.601
They're trying to keep it quiet
so you might not hear about it.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.355
But here I am with a customer's dog,

08:42.355 --> 08:43.981
and I just can't leave her.

08:44.065 --> 08:47.068
So I promise, I'll never come
to work early again.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.947
Well, that sure is a long story.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.823
Yeah, that's how you know it's true.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.700
So let's sell some gas.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.327
Team Strickley rules!

08:56.953 --> 08:58.162
Whoo!

09:04.919 --> 09:07.004
We work as a team here at Strickland.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.881
There are 15 of us, counting you...

09:08.965 --> 09:10.925
Fifteen, wow. What's
this thing called again?

09:10.925 --> 09:12.718
Uh, actually, I haven't told you

09:12.802 --> 09:14.887
- about this grill yet, Leon.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.349
It's called the Vogner Char King,
and it's the crown jewel...

09:18.349 --> 09:20.893
Yeah, sure, Char King. I remember.
It's almost lunchtime, right?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.896
- Well, it's getting close, I guess...

09:23.980 --> 09:24.939
Great, great, great.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.617
Hey, it's the Char King.

09:47.628 --> 09:48.462
<i>No! Dios mio!</i>

09:48.546 --> 09:51.007
<i>- Vaya con Dios.
- No. Dios mio! No, no.</i>

09:51.299 --> 09:55.177
Uh, hey, Leon, you might want
to unwrap that sandwich now.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.471
Lunch has been over for about 20 minutes.

09:57.930 --> 09:58.973
Okay, coach.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.309
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

10:02.810 --> 10:03.811
Uh...

10:03.811 --> 10:04.895
Okay, then.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.900
Hey, Hank, how's your new hire doing?

10:09.984 --> 10:13.529
Oh, I just think
he's going to work out great, sir.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.450
Yeah. Well, I could have sworn
I saw him over by the trucks

10:17.450 --> 10:18.576
puking his guts out.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.622
Well, he's pretty excited
about working in propane, sir, uh...

10:23.205 --> 10:24.832
but once he sells his first grill

10:24.832 --> 10:26.959
those highs and lows will smooth out.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.210
Well, I hope they do.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.671
Remember, Hank,
he's wearing the name Strickland

10:30.755 --> 10:31.922
over his man-teat.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.264
T-man? Oh.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.060
Strickland Propane.
Taste the heat, not the meat.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.019
Lord, no!

10:45.853 --> 10:46.937
Uh, hello? Hello?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.981
Oh, uh, hello, Ms. Shaddock.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.900
I want to sincerely apologize.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.487
Our slogan is,
taste the meat, not the heat.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.032
I hope our error has not
inconvenienced you, and, uh...

10:58.616 --> 10:59.825
Uh-huh.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.371
Well, I hope in the future,
you'll be a customer again.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.582
Taste the meat, not the heat.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.668
- Taste the meat, not the heat.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.920
Meat, heat. Meat, heat.

11:15.383 --> 11:19.387
<i>Fans of Mexican soap operas
know him as the evil Monsignor Martinez.</i>

11:19.387 --> 11:23.057
<i>But off screen, this man of the cloth
makes cloth...</i>

11:23.057 --> 11:25.309
<i>into his own line of casual pants.</i>

11:26.227 --> 11:27.436
Bobby, how would you like

11:27.520 --> 11:29.814
to help me out around
the shop for a few days?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.065
I can't pay you,

11:31.065 --> 11:33.442
but you can have all the snacks you want.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.613
We've got fruit pies, pretzels
all kinds of newtons...

11:39.156 --> 11:40.991
You had me at fruit pies.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.538
- Leon, this is Bobby.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.540
He's going to be helping you out today.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.874
Oh, that's great, that's great

11:48.958 --> 11:51.168
because I am just bursting
with ideas right now.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.716
Okay, listen up.
I got a whole new filing plan.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.051
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

12:01.512 --> 12:06.726
Oh, gosh... there's more files here
than there are stars in the universe.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.854
This would go a lot faster if you helped.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.897
I can't do this. You do it.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.575
What's the matter, Bobby?
You haven't even touched your marrow.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.993
I have to do all the work

12:23.993 --> 12:26.620
because dad's new employee
is a drug addict.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.540
Now, Bobby,
Leon's a little slow on the draw,

12:29.540 --> 12:31.333
but that doesn't mean he's on drugs.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.835
You got to trust me on this.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.423
When you've heard as many former athletes
lecture at your school as I have

12:37.423 --> 12:39.300
you get to know all the signs.

12:39.300 --> 12:43.554
Wait. You hired a drug addict
instead of that beautiful Chicana.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.390
My gosh, Hank, how badly
did you want that woman?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.225
- Now, just hold on, here.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.478
Leon's credentials are top-notch

12:50.686 --> 12:53.022
even if they are
from the nonprofit sector.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.025
Six months at Helping Hands Institute.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.902
One year at Covenant Place.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.403
Those are detox centers.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.613
Centers?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.031
No, look. Right here.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.657
Institute. Place.

13:03.741 --> 13:07.203
Uncle Hank, you're in denial.

13:07.703 --> 13:08.537
Yeah, Dad.

13:08.913 --> 13:12.416
You're what Too-tall Jones called
a codependent enabler.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.253
Well, Leon does do a lot of vomiting...

13:16.712 --> 13:18.339
even for a new employee.

13:18.839 --> 13:23.093
Ah, now, Ms. Throckmorton,
with our new electronic debit system,

13:23.177 --> 13:25.554
you never even have to check your bill.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.599
Oh, my, that does sound convenient.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.852
Uh-huh. We take the money
right out of your account.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.689
What in the Sam Hill?

13:35.773 --> 13:36.816
- Oh, no!

13:36.816 --> 13:39.276
This is your new accessories associate?

13:39.693 --> 13:42.154
Jeez, Hank, he's a drooling nincompoop!

13:42.238 --> 13:44.490
Don't worry, sir, he's as good as gone.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.618
Make sure you don't disgruntle him.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.913
We don't want him showing up tomorrow
morning punching the clock with a 45.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.799
You know, Leon,
maybe you don't have the tools

14:01.799 --> 14:04.260
that an accessories associate needs.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.596
You need to find a job
you can do with your tools.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.432
I've got a ratchet set
I haven't pawned yet.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.936
Yep, yeah, a lot of things you can do
with a good ratchet set.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.771
Maybe you can work on trucks.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.022
Wow.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.983
I don't know what to say.

14:19.859 --> 14:24.321
Hank, as your new chief mechanic,
what I'd like to do first is fire Enrique.

14:24.405 --> 14:28.075
Leon, what I'm trying to say is,
you're a drug user, and...

14:28.617 --> 14:31.078
there's no place for you
at Strickland Propane.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.455
As of 5 o'clock, you're fired.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.707
Oh, no!

14:35.291 --> 14:37.376
Here. It's a rehab center.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.379
Son, why don't you take
the rest of the afternoon off

14:40.379 --> 14:42.089
and get yourself some help?

14:49.513 --> 14:52.766
Leon's in the parking lot,
and he looks disgruntled.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.184
Oh! Hit the decks!

14:54.268 --> 14:55.394
Geez!

15:05.613 --> 15:07.364
I'm sorry I have to do this, coach.

15:08.866 --> 15:09.825
Hello, Mr. Hill.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.620
Anthony Page, group leader,
One Last Chance House.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.955
Are you aware that
you hired a drug addict?

15:15.456 --> 15:17.541
I am now. That's why I fired him.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.627
Oh, yeah. You're in trouble, all right.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.254
It's against the law to fire this man.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.714
He's a drug addict.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.383
Are you sure you don't want to shoot me?

15:30.512 --> 15:31.764
Thanks for the latte, Leon.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.516
You have to rehire this man, Mr. Hill.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.852
Legally, drug addiction is a disability,

15:37.186 --> 15:40.773
and now that Leon's in rehab,
the law prohibits you from firing him.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.358
Rehab? Since when?

15:42.858 --> 15:45.653
Since 4:30 yesterday afternoon.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.364
And I wasn't officially fired till 5:00.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.618
This is the Americans
with disabilities act.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.330
It ensures that no person
no matter how disadvantaged.

15:56.538 --> 16:00.250
How short or obese
or blind or gay or even stoned,

16:00.334 --> 16:03.337
can be discriminated against
once his healing has begun.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.882
Hell, right now I'd kill
for a big, fat, blind gay guy

16:06.966 --> 16:09.051
if we could just get some
darn work done around here.

16:09.593 --> 16:10.678
I can't believe this.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.556
Well, I may be stuck with you,
but you're stuck with me, too,

16:14.682 --> 16:17.101
and there's going to be
some changes around here.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.979
You will be here at 8:00 sharp
from now on.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.606
8:00! Uh, Anthony?

16:22.690 --> 16:24.650
Mm-mm. 8:00 is not going to work for Leon.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.568
He's got withdrawal therapy until 11:00.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.153
But, then I take my methadone.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.739
So I should be feeling pretty good
by the time I get here.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.867
What? I'm not going to let you
come to work late

16:33.951 --> 16:36.745
all hopped-up on goofanthol.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.956
And he'll need to have the lights dimmed.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.501
His pupils will be dilating
pretty big by 12:30.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.295
What kind of game
are you trying to play here?

16:45.421 --> 16:47.256
It's not a game, sir.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.632
It's the law

16:48.716 --> 16:49.883
and we win.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.093
Whoo!

16:53.429 --> 16:57.141
Let's see.
Any company with 15 employees or more

16:57.141 --> 17:00.602
must make reasonable accommodations
for their disabled workers.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.481
I can't believe I'm getting hog-tied
by a dope freak.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.484
Well, of course, you could
have hired Maria Montalvo.

17:07.776 --> 17:10.654
The only accommodation she would have
needed from you was the slobber gut.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.824
Now, if you can get her off
your mind for two seconds

17:14.324 --> 17:15.951
maybe we can get some sleep.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.453
- Oh, gosh.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.208
Now, please.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.253
That's great.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.464
I'm going to go throw up now, coach.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.967
Hank, I got a bone to pick with you.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.137
How come Jimi Hendrix
gets a futon in his work station?

17:35.721 --> 17:38.140
Because he's disabled, Joe Jack.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.892
It's all there in the fine print.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.894
Come on, you've got propane to haul.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.188
Well, honey, I'm too mad to drive a truck.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.231
It's almost like my anger is...

17:46.565 --> 17:47.983
handicapping me.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.735
Joe Jack!

17:54.198 --> 17:56.492
- Customer. Jason, can you get that?

17:57.117 --> 17:57.951
Sorry, Hank.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.412
I suffer from
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.956
If I get out of this chair,
Garth Brooks is going to die.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.833
Joe Jack, can you get that customer?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.089
Much too angry, honey.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.882
Melinda, a little help, please?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.301
Oh! Too bloated!

18:14.301 --> 18:16.053
- Aw, heck. I'll do it myself.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.477
What the hey is going on here?

18:23.477 --> 18:24.520
Shh!

18:24.520 --> 18:25.896
It's Leon.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.314
Now all my employees

18:27.314 --> 18:30.442
want in on that darn Americans
with disabilities act.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.568
She shushed me.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.403
Debbie's got the yuppie flu,

18:33.487 --> 18:36.782
and Hector claims
he has something call priapism.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.244
He wants a roomier work station
and view of Debbie.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.703
Nobody shushes me.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.872
Hank, you cannot stand by
while these greedy pigs

18:43.956 --> 18:45.791
suck the life out of Strickland Propane.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.918
Anybody's disabled,
if you think hard enough.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.462
- Hm.

18:52.214 --> 18:55.342
Hey, if we catch this guy
doing drugs on the job,

18:55.342 --> 18:56.677
we can fire him.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.803
So, here's the deal.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.223
Put on your fancy clothes,
hop a greyhound to Dallas,

19:01.223 --> 19:05.269
and buy every pill, pipe,
powder you can find, see?

19:05.269 --> 19:07.646
And you spread the stuff
around like roach traps,

19:07.646 --> 19:09.439
and we'll get that boy hooked again.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.569
With all due respect, sir,
I have a better plan.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.196
Hello, Mr. Hill.
I came as quick as I could.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.991
From your message, it sounded
as if you'd become the victim

19:18.991 --> 19:20.576
of some kind of discrimination.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.910
That's right, Anthony.

19:21.994 --> 19:26.874
You see, I recently came to realize
that I, too, suffer from a disability.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.168
It's called G.W.S.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.128
Good worker syndrome.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.422
I get sick to my stomach

19:33.422 --> 19:36.758
unless everyone around me
is giving 110 percent.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.928
The symptoms include pride, responsibility

19:40.012 --> 19:41.972
and a feverish enthusiasm.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.766
It used to be a common condition
among Americans.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.271
Ew! People like you who abuse the system

19:49.271 --> 19:50.856
ruin it for the rest of us,

19:50.856 --> 19:52.274
the truly disabled.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.778
I'm leaving. Call me if he gives you
any more trouble, Leon.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.363
Don't call me Leon anymore.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.782
That's the name I used drugs with.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.576
From now on, I want to be called...

20:03.035 --> 20:03.911
Um...

20:05.204 --> 20:06.121
Hank Hill.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.332
No! No, that's too far.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.500
I cannot accommodate that. I won't!

20:10.584 --> 20:12.461
It's not up to you, Hank.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.087
It's up to Hank.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.048
This man is not your slave.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.424
You don't get to name him.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.718
All right, Hank. Get yourself
a bus ticket to Dallas.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.721
I hate to do this,
but you leave me no choice.

20:22.846 --> 20:26.266
There's only room for one Hank Hill
at Strickland Propane.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.101
- I quit.
- What?

20:28.852 --> 20:29.978
What am I going to do now?

20:30.062 --> 20:31.438
Whatever you want, Buck.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.233
With me gone, you're down to 14 employees.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.152
And that makes this your business,
not the government's.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.530
Huh? Hey... Wait.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.699
Hot dang, Hank. You done it!

20:42.824 --> 20:43.867
Thank you, sir.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.202
Not you. You're fired.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.459
Now Strickland's just
small enough to skirt the law.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.669
Y'all get back to work.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.963
Debbie, you just lie right there.

20:59.633 --> 21:03.553
Well, son, you pulled our wieners
out of the campfire just in time.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.306
Well, I guess I did, Buck.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.350
Yeah, so, let's get this over with, Hank.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.811
Where do you see yourself in five years?

21:10.811 --> 21:14.398
Proudly serving as assistant manager
of Strickland Propane.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.483
Welcome back, son. You're rehired.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.860
After a six-month probation period,

21:18.944 --> 21:21.863
you will be eligible
for vacation and benefits.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.699
- Probation?
- Oh, yeah.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.367
You got to understand my position here.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.077
Last couple of Hank Hills I had

21:27.327 --> 21:28.537
one of them was a druggo.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.538
The other quit on me.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.123
Oh, hey...

21:31.123 --> 21:35.002
say howdy to our new
accessories associate.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.672
I am so happy to be
working with you, Hank.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.428
Peggy's in the parking lot.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.096
She looks disgruntled.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.282
Are we starting
a recycling program?

22:05.407 --> 22:09.119
Uh, not... not as such, no.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.370
It's well, uh...

22:10.454 --> 22:11.788
It's for... Uh...

22:12.372 --> 22:13.999
Have you ever been to the doctor,

22:13.999 --> 22:15.751
and the doctor gave you a cup?

22:15.751 --> 22:18.128
Yes, but that was to pee in.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.796
Yeah.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.716
You can go now.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.926
Hank, if you don't
give me another cup,

22:25.052 --> 22:26.845
the Oak-ridge boys are gonna die.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.388
<i>Oh, no!</i>
