WEBVTT

00:04.963 --> 00:06.339
Oh, what the [bleep].

00:06.381 --> 00:09.426
On our last boat, me and
Tash, we got together.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.105
You don’t know what you want.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.857
What the [bleep] are you doing?

00:23.898 --> 00:25.358
Three meters, getting closer.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.735
That is one meter.
She’s gonna hit it, man.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.279
So, I’m letting you go.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.780
I’m excited to see
where this goes.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.366
Why did you buy me a present?

00:36.244 --> 00:37.746
Nat is so
confusing, mate.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.414
Does she wanna be, like,
a really good friend,

00:39.456 --> 00:40.999
or does she wanna lie in bed
and kiss all night?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.667
That needs to be managed better.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.085
The boat’s a sh---show from
the bridge deck down,

00:44.127 --> 00:45.337
and nothing’s pulled at all.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.505
She just tries
to make me look bad.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.382
The pantry’s a mess,
all the décor from the night

00:49.424 --> 00:51.176
is still out, and so I’m
just getting overwhelmed.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.260
That’s not okay.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.928
Yeah, I’m a snitch.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.389
You’ve just said the head of
housekeeping was not here, Kyle.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.891
If you think you’re gonna
come for me like you come

00:57.932 --> 01:00.393
for everyone else, you’re
highly ----ing mistaken.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.645
Storm is stepping in
as the bosun.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.439
It’s been a dream of mine
to obviously become a bosun.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.483
I’m very nervous to be on deck.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.901
Courtney’s like a
little captain out there.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.235
I know!

01:09.277 --> 01:11.112
I’d like to make you
my lead deckhand.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.739
It is quite disappointing.

01:12.781 --> 01:16.659
If you wanna do a bowline,
you must do a proper bowline.

01:16.701 --> 01:20.413
I feel closer to the fish in
the water than the deck crew.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.706
I feel like I’m carrying
more than my load.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.249
-Replace me.
-No, that’s...

01:23.291 --> 01:24.334
-I’m telling you right now...
-Yeah.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.502
bring someone else in.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.338
Oh!

01:28.380 --> 01:30.590
Nat!
I twisted my ankle.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.426
He is not fired,
he’s just going ashore,

01:33.468 --> 01:35.428
and we’re taking
on a stewardess.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.223
My first interest
was linguistics.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.936
Can you cut my tail off, please?

01:42.977 --> 01:45.271
-Cut your tail off.
-Yeah.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.898
Wow, this girl is beautiful.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.444
Oh, they loved it.

01:51.486 --> 01:54.781
-We’re practicing folds.
-Okay.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.032
Final charter.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.409
They’re looking to
treat the company’s

01:57.450 --> 01:59.452
business partners
and NFL players.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.787
-I would like some pancakes.
-For dinner?

02:00.829 --> 02:02.288
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

02:02.330 --> 02:04.040
I’m not eating that sh--.
I did not ask for crepes.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.959
I specifically said "pancakes."

02:06.001 --> 02:07.127
Come on, man.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.128
-Woo!
-Oh!

02:08.169 --> 02:09.587
Ooh!

02:09.629 --> 02:10.797
-I lost my chain.
-It cost the price of a home.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.507
Oh [bleep].

02:22.517 --> 02:25.103
I do want Dave to realize
that there is this line

02:25.145 --> 02:26.479
that you cannot cross.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.231
I can’t deal with
the messages, like...

02:28.273 --> 02:29.691
I’m still in love with her,

02:29.733 --> 02:31.526
so I need to be able
to just push it away.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.114
He’s a ----ing wanker,
how dare he?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.824
He wants to bring
me into it too?

02:40.368 --> 02:43.204
What?
What do you mean?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.106
Woo-hoo!

03:10.148 --> 03:11.775
Go Coco!

03:11.816 --> 03:13.568
So girthy.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.363
How are you?

03:16.404 --> 03:17.989
Good, I’m wonderful,
how are you?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.240
I’m ready.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.992
<i>Tash, Tash, Nat.</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:23.745
<i>The guests are sitting around</i>
<i>waiting for breakfast service.</i>

03:24.621 --> 03:27.916
[alarm blares,
snoring]

03:30.543 --> 03:31.961
Could I have a
green juice, please?

03:32.003 --> 03:33.046
-Green juice?
-Sure thing.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.048
Is there another
green juice?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.841
It’s for her.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.718
Do you want me to run
downstairs, check laundry?

03:38.760 --> 03:39.886
Yes.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.471
One, two, three.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.849
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.186
Ellie, you’ve got the
twin available

03:48.228 --> 03:50.772
and also the double
cabin downstairs.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.736
Well, another day
of water sports.

03:56.778 --> 04:01.157
Don’t wear any
necklaces, watches.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.410
How’s the weather looking
for the rest of the day?

04:03.451 --> 04:06.746
I might have to go in tonight
to the dock, or we won’t...

04:06.788 --> 04:10.041
we may not be able to make it to
the dock, you know what I mean?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.377
We’ll just...
we’ll follow your lead, yeah.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.713
Yeah, we’re gonna
just monitor.

04:22.637 --> 04:23.847
Tash?

04:28.435 --> 04:30.937
Of all my seasons in yachting,

04:30.979 --> 04:36.484
I really have hit
the lowest that I’ve ever been.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.194
I take pride in what I do,

04:38.236 --> 04:39.654
but my personal life
feels like

04:39.696 --> 04:41.948
it’s infected the entire season.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.701
I told off my ex.
He reached out to Dave.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.203
It’s all just sh--.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.413
Tyler, you ready
for breakfast?

04:48.455 --> 04:49.622
Oh, they’re coming now.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.374
-Oh, that was great timing.
-Yeah.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.133
[snoring]

05:00.175 --> 05:01.718
Oof, oh, yeah.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.512
Dave, Dave, I have all the guest
sitting down for breakfast.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.514
<i>Natalya, please give</i>
<i>a hand on service.</i>

05:06.556 --> 05:08.099
Coming up...

05:08.141 --> 05:13.104
So, the special today is smashed
avocado on homemade toast.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.648
Otherwise, you can
choose whatever you prefer.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.817
You!

05:17.859 --> 05:19.319
I’ll do the avocado toast.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.570
Nicely done.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.238
-Three over-easy eggs.
-Yeah?

05:22.280 --> 05:25.617
Breakfast potatoes.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.495
So, if you were to improve
on last night’s pancakes?

05:28.536 --> 05:30.163
-A bit thicker.
-Thicker, yeah?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.832
Yeah, a bit thicker.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.793
Hey, Dave, I’ve got the orders.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.836
Got one special with
scrambled eggs on pita bread,

05:36.878 --> 05:39.422
one special
with a sunny-side up.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.132
What was that?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.550
[bleep]
I hat flies.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.470
This morning I’m asleep,
and all I hear it "zzt."

05:45.512 --> 05:46.763
Smacked the sh-- out of it.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.348
Here’s your pancake man.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.849
Did he want pancakes?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.434
I’m gonna send
the pancakes last.

05:51.476 --> 05:55.897
How ----ing cool would it be if
we did an ayahuasca retreat?

05:59.901 --> 06:02.237
There’s also theories that,
like, psychedelic drugs are,

06:02.278 --> 06:04.698
like, actually just,
like, gateways to better reality

06:04.739 --> 06:06.700
and better perception but,
like, people just hold them

06:06.741 --> 06:08.702
under control so then
they can keep us

06:08.743 --> 06:10.120
as, like, little robots.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.832
I know somebody
who microdoses

06:13.873 --> 06:16.584
and uses it as Adderall,
and she’s smart as sh--.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.466
Special with scrambled eggs
and pita bread.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.094
One special on homemade toast.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.595
Scrambled eggs and bacon.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.055
I can see that, actually.
Thank you so very much.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.348
You’re welcome.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.641
All right, pancakes.

06:31.683 --> 06:32.767
Mm, mm, good.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.269
How is it, dude, good?

06:34.310 --> 06:35.562
Yeah, straight.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.897
Look at my skin,
it’s like a snake.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.694
However I do it
is gonna be wrong.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.243
Yeah.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.745
Those aren’t thin,

06:51.786 --> 06:54.497
but I can already tell you
he doesn’t like them.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.916
He does not like...

06:56.958 --> 06:58.168
that’s not how he
likes his pancakes.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.170
No, they look good.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.091
They look raw on the inside...
oh.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.426
What happened?

07:06.468 --> 07:07.927
It’s... they’re still
batter on the inside,

07:07.969 --> 07:09.429
they’re not cooked all
the way through.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.764
That sh-- is just
----ing terrible.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.973
Look at it, that sh--
look like pudding.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.017
Because they’re
so Goddamn thick.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.560
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.686
Poor Tash.

07:16.728 --> 07:17.937
Look at this.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.105
Okay, so, how would
you prefer...

07:19.147 --> 07:22.776
-Cooked.
-Okay.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.319
It’s okay, don’t...
you don’t gotta...

07:24.361 --> 07:25.320
I don’t wanna hurt his feelings.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.613
Just tell him it was good.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.823
Oh, man, don’t show
him that plate.

07:28.865 --> 07:29.783
Sorry!

07:29.824 --> 07:32.118
Nice, swim platform done.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.620
Is he eating the pancake?

07:33.661 --> 07:36.873
He just said that it was a
bit batter-y, like, a bit raw.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.876
-Are you upset?
-No.

07:39.918 --> 07:40.960
Okay.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.796
Imma just wait till
I get back home

07:42.837 --> 07:44.631
so I can eat my pancakes
the correct way.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.468
He’s a prick.
[bleep] this guy.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.512
-Whatever.
-I need a break.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.644
Oh, my God.

07:57.686 --> 08:00.146
It is my second day
on board, and...

08:00.188 --> 08:01.481
Oh, my God!

08:01.523 --> 08:03.233
I’m late to work.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.693
Oh, my...
oh, my God.

08:07.696 --> 08:08.863
That was amazing.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.702
Natalya, Natalya, Tasha.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.040
-Ooh!
-Good morning.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.796
For [bleep]’s sake, I’ve got
enough on my mind at the moment.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.673
I don’t need this right now.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.677
Okay.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.556
I kinda wanna
get thrown around.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.683
Yeah, Tyler, you
do that, imma watch.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.101
Let me get you a lifejacket.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.103
Ashley and I are gonna
grab one of the skis.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.230
The Sea-Doos? Yeah.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.481
Thank you.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.233
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.741
Oh, okay!

08:56.077 --> 08:58.997
I feel like it was yesterday
I walked on this boat.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.462
Looking back at when I first
jumped onto Lady Michelle,

09:05.503 --> 09:09.090
I was fairly clueless about
every single operation on deck.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.925
Keep the line out of
the water, please.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.928
And looking at myself now,
I’m feeling fairly confident

09:13.970 --> 09:15.513
in most of the deck operations,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.807
and I’m really super proud
of where I’ve come.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.727
Past Mzi is definitely looking
up at future Mzi being,

09:20.769 --> 09:22.937
like, well done, my guy.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.774
I did join after y’all had
had, like, a system in place

09:25.815 --> 09:28.818
and things are going
smooth, you know?

09:47.170 --> 09:50.340
I’m still so, like,
infuriated with this guy.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.301
----ing pointing his finger
at me and calling me a bully.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.845
And Tash agreed to that.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.975
It’s my fault.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.647
Tash?

10:09.401 --> 10:10.944
Coming up...

10:10.985 --> 10:12.946
My rose was gelling into
my role with my crew.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.406
You forgot to mention
one of your roses.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.491
-Get your sh-- together.
-Like, that pisses me off.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.951
Oh, my God.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.120
-What is Storm doing?
-Wait, what is happening?

10:27.127 --> 10:27.752
Let’s see some tricks.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.088
[whistles]

10:32.590 --> 10:33.550
Ah!

10:33.591 --> 10:35.010
Good job!

10:57.657 --> 10:59.242
Tash?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.077
[knocks]

11:02.620 --> 11:03.955
Eh?

11:19.304 --> 11:20.472
I know.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.766
This season,
Dave’s behavior towards me

11:22.807 --> 11:24.309
was completely unacceptable,

11:24.351 --> 11:29.481
but I have learned a lot
about myself in a painful way

11:30.857 --> 11:33.360
that has also been
painful to others.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.570
I don’t know how to be alone.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.113
I should be able to be happy

11:37.155 --> 11:39.449
without relying
on another person.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.993
It’s something that
I’m continuously

11:42.035 --> 11:43.620
trying to work on.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.372
It’s just pretty sh--
when you have to go through it

11:45.413 --> 11:47.916
to learn from it.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.461
All right, Dave.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.129
All right, get some rest.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.516
The wind is gusting.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.184
Like, we’re gonna go
back to the dock.

12:06.226 --> 12:06.976
Okay.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.061
<i>Courtney, Storm.</i>

12:08.103 --> 12:09.646
<i>Just got the go-ahead from Cap,</i>

12:09.688 --> 12:10.855
<i>we’re gonna start</i>
<i>wrapping things up, okay?</i>

12:10.897 --> 12:12.023
Copy that.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.488
You know you have
a condom sticking

12:18.530 --> 12:19.989
out of your back pocket?

12:25.370 --> 12:26.788
[chuckles]

12:26.830 --> 12:27.831
I’m having dinner with them.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.332
-You are?
-Yeah.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.208
Okay.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.127
I didn’t do it last night.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.880
Dinnertime.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.224
It’s like, get going,
let’s do it.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.311
Anything that can
float is all in?

12:50.353 --> 12:51.521
Yep.

12:51.563 --> 12:54.024
What are you making for
dinner this evening?

12:54.065 --> 12:55.859
I’m gonna do, like,
Asian tonight.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.318
I’m gonna do sea bream.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.197
<i>-Anchor up.</i>
-Yeah, yeah, copy.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.494
The anchor is home.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.622
Tash, I did it.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.208
All the ----ing bullsh--,
I just did it.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.543
Yeah.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.754
Personally, I literally
took so many steps

13:15.795 --> 13:17.422
backwards this season.

13:17.464 --> 13:21.968
I [bleep] I’m so ----ed up.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.303
I feel like I caused
so much drama,

13:23.345 --> 13:25.221
it really affected
the other crew.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.599
They didn’t deserve it,
and the last I can do

13:27.640 --> 13:30.310
is cook something amazing
for the last dinner.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.316
Look how dope that is.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.610
-That’s crazy.
-Right at six.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.694
It’s insane.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.695
First, we’ll need bread plates.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.239
-Mm-hmm.
-Two, four, six.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.325
Courtney and Reid,
Courtney and Reid,

13:45.367 --> 13:48.578
when we turn into the marina
you can put your fenders out.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.996
Copy that, Storm-O.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.247
Do you have any
particular placemats

13:51.289 --> 13:52.749
that you want me to get?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.376
I’ve got these gold chargers.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.544
That’s a great idea.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.340
Okay, Mzi,
these two middle ones...

14:00.382 --> 14:01.424
Yeah?

14:01.466 --> 14:03.385
You’re gonna be on
the third one.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.345
<i>Courtney and Reid,</i>
<i>you’re gonna throw your spring</i>

14:05.387 --> 14:06.930
to the guy with the white shirt.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.140
Yeah, guy with the
white shirt, we see it.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.767
<i>Copy, thank you.</i>

14:10.809 --> 14:12.602
There’s a couple of elements
that could definitely add

14:12.644 --> 14:15.105
to how difficult a task
is a docking at night.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.439
We have got a lot of current,

14:16.481 --> 14:18.983
visibility ultimately is
your biggest fault.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.945
This is the last time I get
to show what I’ve learned

14:21.986 --> 14:23.446
about being a bosun, and

14:23.488 --> 14:25.699
to show Sandy she made
the right decision.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.117
Good throw, mate.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.452
Spring is on the dock.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.705
So, go around there
and then under the capstan,

14:31.746 --> 14:32.872
four tight turns.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.290
Give it a little
push down... yeah.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.459
Okay, let’s go,
let’s go, let’s go.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.293
I’m tight.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.837
We made it, great job.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.630
You know what’s funny, taking
the Staten Island ferry,

14:40.672 --> 14:42.799
they used to always hit the
side of the ----ing docks.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.051
-Oh, did they?
-Always.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.721
The last night,
all good, my bro.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.848
It looks so cute, aw.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.099
Look at this.

14:51.141 --> 14:54.644
Ellie, Ellie, Tash.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.105
Okay, on my way, thank you.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.149
Oh, now, that’s awesome.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.234
I mean, come on.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.361
It’s the last service.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.239
The pressure’s on.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.366
-Is everyone out there?
-I think so.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.785
-Tell them to start seating.
-Oh, my...

15:13.413 --> 15:15.749
All right, guys, let’s everyone
around the table.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.752
If you’re ready, you can
please take a seat,

15:18.793 --> 15:21.087
and we’ll start serving waters.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.422
Quickly to all, Captain Sandy,

15:22.464 --> 15:24.007
thank you for joining
us this evening.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.216
Aw, thank you.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.426
And love you all,
so, thank you.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.761
Cheers.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.304
Cheers, thank you for a
wonderful couple of days.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.307
Then I’ve got one,
and it goes like this.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.308
Wait, hold on,
you gotta stand up,

15:33.350 --> 15:34.392
you gotta stand up for this one.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.061
-You gotta stand up.
-Okay.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.271
Jack and Jill went up the hill
so Jack could lick her candy,

15:38.313 --> 15:40.273
but Jack got a shock and
a mouthful of [bleep]

15:40.315 --> 15:42.359
because Jill’s
real name was Randy.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.445
Cheers!

15:45.487 --> 15:46.654
Come on.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.202
All right.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.578
-Okay, guys.
-Stunning.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.996
Hey, Dave, you’re
a little wizard, bro.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.122
Look at these little tongues.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.416
This looks absolutely divine.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.876
What’s this right here?

15:59.918 --> 16:02.212
It’s gonna get announced
by the chef himself.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.755
Oh, wow, that’s amazing.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.549
Okay, guys, we’ve got a
cauliflower-lemongrass puree,

16:06.591 --> 16:08.760
and we’ve got grilled sea bream,

16:08.802 --> 16:09.969
dehydrated beetroot,

16:10.011 --> 16:11.221
and just a little
bit of kresh.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.683
Thank you so much.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.394
-What kind of fish is that?
-Sea bream.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.228
Wow.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.729
That is delicious.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.398
Picture-worthy.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.316
I mean, delicious.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.567
You can head back
to the cabins now.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.111
Okay.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.862
Reid, I think you’re gonna
be in the most luck tomorrow.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.323
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.036
Yeah, I could
see that happening.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.788
Yeah.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.667
What brought you to wanna be
in sailing and stuff?

16:40.709 --> 16:42.585
I got on that drug and
alcohol merry-go-round.

16:42.627 --> 16:43.712
Yeah.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.088
So, I got kicked out
in eleventh grade,

16:45.130 --> 16:46.589
so I needed to get a job.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.759
I started washing boats,
and then I did such a great job,

16:49.801 --> 16:51.511
this guy offered
me a full-time job,

16:51.553 --> 16:53.263
and then he sent me
to sea school.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.931
-That’s dope.
-That’s pretty cool.

16:54.973 --> 16:58.018
Do you wanna dry these and put
them in the cabin, thank you.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.436
If I have to.

17:00.645 --> 17:04.566
Can we have five minutes
in the day head?

17:04.607 --> 17:05.817
Can we have five minutes in
the day head?

17:05.859 --> 17:07.277
Yeah, I just wanna talk about...

17:07.318 --> 17:08.945
Next time, at least buy me
a cup of tea first.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.572
I’ll make you a cup of tea.

17:10.613 --> 17:11.948
Oh, my God, you’re freaky.
You’re, like, buzzing.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.742
I know.
I’m just stoked.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.744
I’m also sad at the same time,
because I’m stuck in the middle.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.955
If you weren’t here, I wouldn’t
be sad, so thanks for that.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.623
Thanks.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.376
I need to get plates,
you’re distracting me.

17:23.418 --> 17:24.961
It’s difficult with Nat.

17:25.003 --> 17:31.009
I think that she enjoys having
me be that person for her,

17:31.051 --> 17:33.219
but she doesn’t have a...

17:33.261 --> 17:36.639
you know, not that
she won’t miss me,

17:36.681 --> 17:38.683
but I think that it...
I’ll miss her more.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.019
When you tie your hair
like that, it’s my favorite.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.187
Oh my God.

17:44.606 --> 17:48.443
-Coming up...
-Is that Kyle?

17:48.485 --> 17:50.153
-Hello!
-Hello!

17:50.195 --> 17:51.529
It’s our last night out.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.491
I’m pent up, I kinda got
to remember my foot.

17:54.532 --> 17:55.867
Kyle!

18:00.246 --> 18:02.582
I don’t like mushrooms but these
----ing mushrooms are good.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.377
Dave, you want us to put the
plates on the table, right?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.212
-Yeah, I think so.
-Yeah?

18:07.253 --> 18:10.382
You have such a good aura,
energy, it’s positive.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.218
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah, no, I mean that, yeah.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.511
When you guys are
done your break,

18:14.552 --> 18:15.720
can you go help Ellie
in the cabins?

18:15.762 --> 18:16.763
Yeah.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.725
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.229
Please don’t.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.481
Ellie, Ellie, Courtney.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.899
-Mzi?
-Go ahead.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.526
She’s right here,
she’s right here.

18:29.567 --> 18:30.694
Oh.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.862
Reid’s on his was
to help you, Ellie.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.239
-Really?
-Yep.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.117
Okay.
You don’t need to.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.368
"Okay!"

18:39.994 --> 18:43.581
Okay, I’m gonna go.
Thank you.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.168
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.420
-Good night, Captain.
-You’re the best, thanks.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.838
Sleep well.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.131
I will, thank you.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.298
Okay, what do you
need help with?

18:52.340 --> 18:55.051
This.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.469
-David.
-Yeah?

18:56.511 --> 18:58.179
That was so good,
it was yummy, yummy, yummy.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.390
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

19:00.432 --> 19:01.933
-Reid?
-Yes, ma’am?

19:01.975 --> 19:04.644
Do you mind just grabbing
the other side of this suitcase

19:04.686 --> 19:06.312
so we can place
it on the floor?

19:06.354 --> 19:07.772
More than happy to help.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.357
I am single.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.777
I don’t look negatively upon
dating or hooking up on yachts.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.448
I think that
you can have fun with people

19:16.489 --> 19:18.116
and it not be serious.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.326
All right, awesome job.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.495
My grandmother’s
gonna kill me.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.205
We’re all good,
this is the last cabin.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.457
Oh, really?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.293
So, now you can help
with laundry.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.669
Ellie, Ellie, Tasha.

19:31.463 --> 19:32.756
Do you need help
with anything else?

19:32.797 --> 19:35.300
Do you mind running
the washers at all?

19:35.342 --> 19:36.301
Yeah, I can do that.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.385
I’m the Oprah Winfrey.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.637
You get a plate for dessert.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.930
If you wanna hold the box,

19:40.972 --> 19:42.140
and I’ll take the tongs
and serve it.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.767
That’s better.

19:43.808 --> 19:48.396
For desert, it’s actually
a cheesecake with ginger crumb.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.149
-It looks cute.
-Thank you so much.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.318
The crunchies and everything
together is really good.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.403
Stay like that.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.949
I’m good to go inside.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.117
I’m full.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.994
I love yachting.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.287
Chef, thank you.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.164
-You’re welcome.
-Phenomenal.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.248
I really appreciate that.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.708
-No, we do.
-Thank you.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.629
I love you guys.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.339
-Good night, love you.
-Love you.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.508
Good night.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.061
Hello.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.486
I gotta go, I’ve gotta go,
I’ve gotta go...

20:36.528 --> 20:37.737
okay.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.631
Good morning.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.299
-How are you?
-I like that top, baby.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.384
Mimosa.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.802
Oh, thank you so much.

21:00.844 --> 21:04.597
Two eggs over-easy,
a scrambled egg, whites...

21:04.639 --> 21:07.934
Storm, this is, like, our
last solid day together.

21:07.976 --> 21:08.935
I know, dude.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.687
Should I put it
on the lazy Susan?

21:10.729 --> 21:12.063
Thank you so very much.

21:12.105 --> 21:12.939
You’re welcome.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.232
The omelette’s really good.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.692
I tore mine up.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.986
Would you like me to
order some more pancakes?

21:18.028 --> 21:19.362
No, it’s fine.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.114
I don’t even wanna talk
about pancakes ever again.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.868
Do you wanna get changed
into your epaulettes, hon?

21:24.909 --> 21:25.827
Yeah.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.662
We got 30 minutes,
by the way.

21:27.704 --> 21:31.458
Oh, my God, it’s all ending,
what the [bleep].

21:36.087 --> 21:37.547
All packed.

21:37.589 --> 21:39.049
Where do we need to meet?

21:39.090 --> 21:41.885
Just on the docks, we just
line up on the dock.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.013
Luggage time, one last time.

21:45.055 --> 21:48.224
I’m so happy, I won’t miss
this pantry one bit.

21:48.266 --> 21:51.102
All crew, all crew to the dock
for guest departure.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.270
Hola, you guys.

21:52.312 --> 21:56.441
-[speaking Spanish]
-Woo!

21:56.483 --> 21:57.776
Oh, it’s raining.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.194
-Wow.
-Bye, guys.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.904
-It was good to meet you.
-It was such a pleasure.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.280
Yes, thank you, thank you,
I’ll see you again.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.782
It was so nice to meet you.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.075
Glad to have you on.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.493
-Chef, thank you.
-Thank you so much.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.494
-Really appreciate it.
-Of course.

22:07.535 --> 22:08.828
Captain, thank you.

22:08.870 --> 22:11.289
So, we would love to say
we had a wonderful time,

22:11.331 --> 22:12.999
and you made our experience,

22:13.041 --> 22:15.960
you know, everything that
we expected and more.

22:16.002 --> 22:16.836
Thank you.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.046
So, this goes to you and...

22:18.088 --> 22:18.963
Thanks, guys.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.131
We thank you all
very, very much.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.216
Thank you.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.884
Yeah, safe travels to all,
all right?

22:22.926 --> 22:24.803
-Same to you.
-It was so good to meet you all.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.887
-Thank you.
-We did it...

22:25.929 --> 22:27.597
Charter number nine, amazing.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.973
Let’s stay in our whites

22:29.015 --> 22:30.809
and meet in the main salon
for a tip meeting.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.060
-Woo!
-Perfect.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.436
Come on, Red Bulls
in the fridge.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.063
Let’s all roll out, boys.

22:35.105 --> 22:37.982
-It was a pleasure.
-Oh, yeah!

22:38.024 --> 22:42.237
[screaming]

22:47.200 --> 22:49.619
-Let’s go!
-Let’s get lit.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.204
Those look colorful.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.997
This is just Aperol spritz.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.666
Where’s Natalya?

22:54.708 --> 22:56.251
-Wait, we need nat.
-She’s on the bar.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.585
Natalya, Natalya.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.504
<i>Oh, sorry, is</i>
<i>everyone up there?</i>

22:59.546 --> 23:02.340
I’m just finishing,
I’ll be there in a second.

23:02.382 --> 23:03.383
Copy.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.427
Oh, my God, what is she up to?

23:05.468 --> 23:07.095
Oh, my God.

23:07.137 --> 23:10.056
[laughing]

23:10.098 --> 23:11.433
Coming up...

23:11.474 --> 23:12.809
Woo!

23:12.851 --> 23:14.060
OMG!

23:14.102 --> 23:15.103
Honestly.

23:15.145 --> 23:16.730
Woo!

23:16.771 --> 23:19.733
I’ve never seen anything like
this.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.660
Oh, my God, what is she up to?

23:34.289 --> 23:36.708
Oh, my God.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.794
Charter nine...

23:39.836 --> 23:43.089
charter nine, everybody.

23:43.131 --> 23:48.303
All I can say,
this envelope, it’s thick.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.931
We started off strong,

23:51.973 --> 23:54.684
we’ve ended strong... wow.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.938
High five.
High five.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.231
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

24:00.273 --> 24:03.193
Woo!

24:04.694 --> 24:05.779
So good.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.323
That was awesome... wow.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.284
[laughing]

24:11.326 --> 24:12.702
What can I say?

24:12.744 --> 24:13.870
We made it through the season.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.789
One man down, Kyle.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.291
Elena filled in like
a breath of fresh air.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.584
Yeah.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.796
Twenty thousand dollars,
$1,800 per person.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.881
-Woo-hoo!
-Wow.

24:24.923 --> 24:26.174
Blowing out the bank.

24:26.216 --> 24:30.970
So, our season total
is $188,100.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.639
-Woo!
-Holy crap.

24:32.681 --> 24:36.643
That’s incredible, and
that’s 17,000 per person.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.561
-Not bad!
-We’re rich!

24:38.603 --> 24:40.313
Oh, wow.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.607
So, it’s your final dinner,
and I’ll be joining you.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.984
-Yay!
-Woo-hoo!

24:45.026 --> 24:47.112
Cheers.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.573
-Thank you, Captain Sandy!
-Woo!

24:50.615 --> 24:52.701
No more laundry, woo-hoo!

25:02.544 --> 25:04.087
[bleep]

25:05.922 --> 25:07.674
Oh, my bag.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.676
Is that Kyle?

25:09.718 --> 25:12.387
-Hello!
-Hello!

25:13.805 --> 25:16.307
I’m back!

25:16.349 --> 25:17.809
Getting ready time.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.019
I’ll just jump in a guest cabin.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.186
Thank you so much.

25:20.228 --> 25:21.312
Welcome back.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.731
Just realized you’re
here, [bleep].

25:22.772 --> 25:24.107
Thanks, Dave.

25:24.149 --> 25:25.775
How you feeling,
how’s your foot?

25:25.817 --> 25:28.987
Really good, the shoe’s just
a bit tight around my ankle.

25:29.904 --> 25:30.947
There he is.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.532
Hey, bitches!

25:32.574 --> 25:34.492
Oh, hello!
How you feeling, eh?

25:36.244 --> 25:38.288
-In the twin, yeah.
-Ooh!

25:38.329 --> 25:40.040
It’s quite lonesome to be
by yourself

25:40.081 --> 25:41.750
during a recovery process,

25:41.791 --> 25:43.168
but I mean, it’s our
last night out.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.837
I’m pent up, I kinda
got to remember my foot.

25:45.879 --> 25:48.923
But I mean, I think
after two tequilas,

25:48.965 --> 25:50.383
magically, everything
feels great.

25:52.427 --> 25:55.722
Hey, Tash, do you think
this dress is okay for tonight?

25:55.764 --> 25:57.849
Ooh!

26:02.062 --> 26:03.063
Hey!

26:04.272 --> 26:05.982
Oh, my God, you look gorgeous!

26:06.024 --> 26:09.944
Thanks!
Sexy man.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.905
-Yeah, sure.
-Ooh, gorgeous.

26:11.946 --> 26:14.324
Did you get it?
Yay, thank you!

26:14.366 --> 26:16.576
Ooh! Look at you!

26:16.618 --> 26:17.827
Ready to party!

26:17.869 --> 26:19.412
Hi!

26:19.454 --> 26:20.872
You look so good.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.333
Everyone looks so ----ing hot...
everyone.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.752
I might sleep with
one of you tonight.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.212
Let’s go.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.716
Party bus!

26:31.758 --> 26:32.967
-Ah!
-Party bus!

26:33.009 --> 26:35.011
Oh, my God.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.472
-This is so adorable.
-Wow.

26:37.514 --> 26:38.556
This is gorgeous!

26:38.598 --> 26:40.183
This is awesome.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.309
Party bus!

26:45.897 --> 26:48.358
-All right, thank you.
-Thank you so much.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.194
Oh, yay, this looks
like our restaurant.

26:51.236 --> 26:52.612
Oh, wow.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.406
Hello, how are you?

26:54.447 --> 26:55.198
This is very nice.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.783
Where are you sitting at?

26:56.825 --> 26:58.827
I’ll sit next to you,
with the boys across... hello.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.537
Amazing, thank you so much.

27:00.578 --> 27:03.957
So, Captain, now that we’re
all here, out of me and Kyle,

27:03.998 --> 27:06.084
we can officially say who
was your favorite.

27:07.669 --> 27:08.837
If we were both
hanging off a cliff,

27:08.878 --> 27:10.672
who would you have picked?

27:10.714 --> 27:12.549
No, but we’re both dying.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.300
You can take any...

27:14.342 --> 27:16.469
Honestly, Nat, I’d give you a
longer life and I’d choose you.

27:16.511 --> 27:18.346
Unfortunately that isn’t
your decision,

27:18.388 --> 27:21.307
because Captain’s already stood
on your hand and kicked you off.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.226
I know if I was hanging off
a cliff with Kyle,

27:23.268 --> 27:24.561
that Sandy would pick me.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.521
So, I just need her
to actually say that

27:26.563 --> 27:28.565
so Kyle knows his place
as third stew.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.359
I have questions.

27:31.401 --> 27:32.694
Mm!

27:32.736 --> 27:34.446
I wanna know, like, what
were your highs and lows.

27:34.487 --> 27:37.198
I’ve had a few highs
this season for sure.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.451
I feel like I was so,
like, welcomed,

27:39.492 --> 27:42.078
as being a female
deckie and stuff.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.622
Like, yeah, obviously
getting lead deckhand

27:44.664 --> 27:46.583
and stuff, it was amazing.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.337
I’m gonna start
with my thorn, actually.

27:50.378 --> 27:53.673
I’ve probably been some of
the lowest times I’ve had.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.008
I’m not gonna get into it.

27:55.050 --> 27:57.844
But my rose is the fact
that how all of you guys

27:57.886 --> 28:01.348
have supported me, and
I’m super grateful for that.

28:01.389 --> 28:04.684
I’d say my rose, like,
Kyle, you’ve been a rock,

28:04.726 --> 28:06.227
you’ve really been there for me.

28:06.269 --> 28:09.606
And Natalya,
we’ve been like twins,

28:09.647 --> 28:12.359
and everyone’s seen it,
and they just feel the gel.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.526
Yeah.

28:13.568 --> 28:14.986
Dave, what can I say?

28:15.028 --> 28:17.530
Like, you’ve always been
super patient and super calm,

28:17.572 --> 28:21.701
and that has just made my job,
like, a million times easier.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.995
Are we supposed to do the
thorn first or the rose first?

28:24.037 --> 28:26.122
Whatever your heart desires,
my love.

28:26.164 --> 28:29.626
I think my thorn was
hitting the dolphin,

28:29.668 --> 28:32.128
and that was just the lack
of my own experience.

28:32.170 --> 28:35.382
But my rose was not just
getting along with this crew,

28:35.423 --> 28:38.093
with everyone, but specifically
gelling into my role

28:38.134 --> 28:39.719
with my crew,
and I’ll always carry it

28:39.761 --> 28:40.887
for the rest of my life.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.389
Like, for all my career,
you know?

28:42.430 --> 28:45.266
I just had a phenomenal
time on board.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.061
but that’s absolutely fine.

28:48.103 --> 28:49.229
Yeah, I was honestly
waiting for that.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.647
Mm.

28:50.689 --> 28:52.357
I had originally thought
about it, but then I was like,

28:52.399 --> 28:56.319
I know how much Nat hates,
like, public affection.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.405
I would have sat there
and, like, done an Oscar,

28:58.446 --> 29:00.532
like, Leonardo DiCaprio
vibes for her, you know?

29:00.573 --> 29:02.617
But I didn’t do it because
I knew she didn’t want it,

29:02.659 --> 29:05.161
and then when I didn’t do
it I got in sh--.

29:06.204 --> 29:07.997
-Okay.
-That’s a later...

29:18.216 --> 29:19.175
Forgot to mention one
of your roses,

29:20.218 --> 29:21.511
but that’s absolutely fine.

29:21.553 --> 29:23.179
Yeah, I was
honestly waiting for that.

29:23.221 --> 29:24.848
Yeah, I was waiting for the
proposal, but fine.

29:24.889 --> 29:26.433
I was... yeah, but he took it
from me, that’s the thing.

29:26.474 --> 29:27.475
It’s been a pleasure,
you guys have fun.

29:27.517 --> 29:29.019
-Mwah, mwah!
-Bye, Cap.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.645
-Good job, good job, good job.
-See you, Sandy.

29:30.687 --> 29:31.646
Oh, thank you.

29:31.688 --> 29:33.231
I’m so full.

29:34.065 --> 29:35.567
Come with me, man.

29:48.413 --> 29:51.124
But that’s not
her thing, though, bro.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.375
How can I keep up
with her sh--?

29:52.417 --> 29:54.419
She doesn’t like
public affection.

29:54.461 --> 29:57.213
Like to have my last night
with the woman...

29:57.255 --> 29:58.673
Yeah, don’t take it seriously.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.133
-that I ----ing...
-Don’t take it seriously.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.468
drinking whiskey on the rocks?

30:01.509 --> 30:02.635
I’m just drinking
whiskey straight.

30:05.388 --> 30:06.806
You’re wild.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.224
Why?

30:08.266 --> 30:10.101
I’ve never, like,
sipped at an alcohol.

30:10.143 --> 30:13.104
Mm, give it a try,
you might like it.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.147
Maybe I should.

30:14.189 --> 30:15.440
Whatever, dude.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.150
Everybody needs to make
sure we are awake,

30:17.192 --> 30:18.151
because we’re about
to go hard.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.736
Amen, sister.

30:19.778 --> 30:21.196
I wanna party, I don’t wanna
sit around and talk.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.655
All right, guys, let’s go!

30:22.697 --> 30:24.699
Woo!

30:24.741 --> 30:26.076
Need to get lit tonight.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.369
Woo!

30:27.410 --> 30:29.788
Here you go, Mzi.

30:39.297 --> 30:40.590
Thank you.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.552
He’s kinda making
me feel like, ooh,

30:44.594 --> 30:47.555
I wish I had more time
to get to know him better.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.313
You know what...

30:58.692 --> 31:00.819
Ah!

31:00.860 --> 31:04.614
I’m in a maxi-skirt, Kyle!
Not again, not again, Kyle!

31:04.656 --> 31:06.574
Natalya’s got a
genuinely good heart.

31:06.616 --> 31:08.576
She’s a massive ball of energy.

31:08.618 --> 31:11.955
After all the tears, farts,
tribulations, wars,

31:11.996 --> 31:17.085
I can easily forgive, but I will
not forget what you have done.

31:17.127 --> 31:18.253
But who’s counting?

31:25.635 --> 31:28.179
Oh, Mzi!

31:28.221 --> 31:30.181
Opa!

31:30.223 --> 31:32.017
Idiot!

31:32.058 --> 31:33.852
Let’s all go home.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.979
There ya go.

31:36.021 --> 31:39.357
Hi!

31:39.399 --> 31:41.568
Everybody in.
Everybody in.

31:41.609 --> 31:44.487
This is the girls’ car,
girls’ car!

31:44.529 --> 31:45.447
Woo!

31:45.488 --> 31:47.115
Kyle, that literally stinks!

31:47.157 --> 31:49.325
Are we continuing
our after-party?

31:49.367 --> 31:51.369
-Yes.
-Yay!

31:54.831 --> 31:57.125
The last time hanging out
with all you members.

31:57.167 --> 31:58.335
Because we’re ----ing--

31:58.376 --> 31:59.836
Slam it, homie!

31:59.878 --> 32:02.672
-An absolute time, dudes.
-To end of the season.

32:02.714 --> 32:06.343
-Power Rangers.
-Woo-hoo!

32:06.384 --> 32:07.969
All of you ----ers, listen here,

32:08.011 --> 32:09.804
when you get there, we’re
taking all our clothes off,

32:09.846 --> 32:12.724
and we’re jumping into
that little river, deal?

32:12.766 --> 32:14.184
No.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.853
Honestly, like...

32:16.895 --> 32:18.521
Ah!

32:20.899 --> 32:24.152
Whoa... wait, what is
happening over there?

32:24.194 --> 32:26.112
-Oh, my God, your boyfriend.
-Storm!

32:26.154 --> 32:27.322
We’re all going for a swim,
we’re going for a swim.

32:27.364 --> 32:28.406
No, you’re bloody not...

32:28.448 --> 32:29.407
No, Storm, it’s not even funny.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.408
What are you talking...

32:30.450 --> 32:31.868
Because you’re, no.

32:31.910 --> 32:33.745
-We all just said--
-No, no one else has got...

32:33.787 --> 32:35.038
everyone’s got their clothes on.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.748
They all just agreed to it.

32:36.790 --> 32:39.125
All right, well,
you’re sleeping by yourself.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.669
What is Storm doing?

32:40.710 --> 32:42.504
All of you said that you
wanted to swim in the car.

32:42.545 --> 32:43.797
Okay, come, come, come.

32:43.838 --> 32:45.590
Yeah, let’s go inside,
inside, inside.

32:45.632 --> 32:48.635
Storm can’t go swim that,
it’s been boarded up.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.513
How?

32:54.099 --> 32:57.018
Storm, mate, what’s happening,
mate, honestly?

33:00.855 --> 33:02.232
Uncle?

33:02.273 --> 33:04.067
Mate, you want to make me
look like a ----ing idiot.

33:04.109 --> 33:05.735
How?

33:05.777 --> 33:07.612
Can you just tell him that
you’re not disappointed in him?

33:09.739 --> 33:10.949
-Hi.
-Hi!

33:10.990 --> 33:12.242
Close the door, Mzi.

33:12.283 --> 33:15.745
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

33:17.122 --> 33:19.040
Get into bed.

33:19.082 --> 33:21.543
Money, money, money.

33:21.584 --> 33:23.461
Everyone in the car said
let’s take our clothes off

33:23.503 --> 33:25.672
in the water,
and I ----ing do that,

33:25.714 --> 33:27.424
and then I looked like an idiot
in front of you,

33:27.465 --> 33:28.633
and that’s what I care about.

33:28.675 --> 33:29.926
This is your last
night on board.

33:29.968 --> 33:31.136
Stop letting stupid stuff
ruin that.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.762
It’s not stupid stuff.

33:32.804 --> 33:34.347
If you see a future with me,
then all your focus should be

33:34.389 --> 33:37.225
on enjoying the rest of
our last time together.

33:37.267 --> 33:38.810
Right now, it’s gonna annoy me

33:38.852 --> 33:40.270
if you don’t get
your sh-- together,

33:40.311 --> 33:42.272
come have a drink,
and come join us.

33:42.313 --> 33:44.816
Oh, I’m still gonna have
a drink, of course, I’m fine.

33:44.858 --> 33:48.236
I’m not... am I...
okay, fair enough.

33:48.278 --> 33:49.612
-All right, let’s do it.
-Don’t be a little sourpuss.

33:49.654 --> 33:52.323
I’m not a sourpuss.

33:55.994 --> 33:57.245
Wait, are you...
what are you going...

33:57.287 --> 33:58.621
are you going to bed?

33:58.663 --> 34:00.749
-Do you want anything...
-I’m going... oh!

34:00.790 --> 34:02.208
Kyle!

34:02.250 --> 34:03.960
Ankle, what ankle?

34:04.002 --> 34:06.588
-Are you okay?
-I’m fine.

34:10.008 --> 34:11.926
You’re not jumping off
the sundeck.

34:11.968 --> 34:13.470
Sorry.

34:13.511 --> 34:15.722
I think I’m gonna have to
lay down for a minute.

34:20.352 --> 34:24.022
-Yeah!
-Woo!

34:24.064 --> 34:28.568
Yes, yes!

34:32.447 --> 34:34.366
You are such a stripper.

34:36.618 --> 34:39.496
Oh, my God, I’ve never
seen anything like this.

34:39.537 --> 34:41.206
Oh, my God!

34:41.247 --> 34:43.333
We’ve had, like, two hours’
sleep for, like, four days.

34:43.375 --> 34:44.459
We’re, like ----ed.

34:44.501 --> 34:45.835
This is the support I need.

34:45.877 --> 34:48.838
Like, I was just, like,
ah, going wild.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.384
Ooh, oh, oh!

34:52.425 --> 34:54.886
Woo!

34:56.388 --> 34:58.014
Woo-hoo!

34:58.056 --> 34:59.724
Oh, my God!

35:04.187 --> 35:06.690
Come on, girl!

35:06.731 --> 35:09.025
This night is definitely
the wildest sides

35:09.067 --> 35:10.276
I’ve seen of everybody.

35:10.318 --> 35:14.572
Like, Tash, I did not
see that side of her.

35:15.699 --> 35:18.785
Woo!

35:18.827 --> 35:21.871
Guys, I’m just gonna say we can
all do whatever we want but...

35:21.913 --> 35:22.956
Tash!

35:22.997 --> 35:24.708
I do feel like we should
start to unwind.

35:24.749 --> 35:26.543
Tash, get you in our bed, love.

35:26.584 --> 35:28.044
-Guys?
-Yes.

35:28.086 --> 35:29.879
I don’t mind Mzi sleeping
in Nat’s bed,

35:29.921 --> 35:31.548
if you both wanna
sleep in your room.

35:31.589 --> 35:33.758
-That’s her call.
-That’s up to you guys.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.346
Come on, Mzi-dawg.

35:38.388 --> 35:40.181
Our last night.

36:09.919 --> 36:12.464
I like him, too.

36:38.865 --> 36:39.199
[snoring]

36:40.325 --> 36:42.035
[alarm sounds]

36:42.077 --> 36:43.078
[bleep]

36:43.119 --> 36:44.871
Mm.

36:47.624 --> 36:49.167
Never do that.

36:49.209 --> 36:51.294
Do you know what happens if
you put a fork in a toaster?

36:51.336 --> 36:52.587
It explodes.

36:52.629 --> 36:54.673
-Really?
-Yes.

36:54.714 --> 36:56.716
How do I not know this?

36:56.758 --> 36:59.969
If one of you ----ing hos
have any makeup of mine...

37:07.602 --> 37:09.562
All right, guys,
I’m leaving now.

37:09.604 --> 37:10.855
Tash.

37:10.897 --> 37:12.649
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

37:12.691 --> 37:15.402
-Bye.
-Reid!

37:15.443 --> 37:17.696
Thank you for all your
positivity, you’re so amazing.

37:17.737 --> 37:19.614
-Of course!
-Let’s stay in touch.

37:19.656 --> 37:21.282
Yeah, of course we will.

37:21.324 --> 37:23.159
[sighs]

37:23.201 --> 37:24.536
-Shoot.
-Awesome.

37:24.577 --> 37:25.578
All sorted.

37:25.620 --> 37:28.039
-Okay.
-Bye again.

37:28.081 --> 37:29.749
Take care.

37:29.791 --> 37:31.501
I don’t wanna go home just yet.

37:31.543 --> 37:33.670
Guys, I’m leaving.

37:33.712 --> 37:36.256
-All right, see ya.
-All right, bye.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.049
There you are.

37:38.091 --> 37:39.592
Thanks for everything,
homie, you’re a legend.

37:39.634 --> 37:41.720
-Bye.
-Bye.

37:41.761 --> 37:42.887
Thanks for all the good work.

37:42.929 --> 37:44.556
It was a pleasure.
See you guys.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.391
Bye, Reid!

37:46.433 --> 37:47.434
Appreciate it.

37:47.475 --> 37:49.894
-Captain Sandy.
-Mzi.

37:49.936 --> 37:52.731
Thank you so,
so much for this season.

37:52.772 --> 37:54.858
It’s been amazing, you’ve
been absolutely incredible.

37:54.899 --> 37:56.067
The biggest inspiration,

37:56.109 --> 37:59.237
and just guiding
and everything and more.

37:59.279 --> 38:00.822
You’re always
welcome on board...

38:00.864 --> 38:02.699
-Yeah.
-wherever I’m the captain.

38:02.741 --> 38:03.742
Thank you, Captain,
I appreciate that.

38:03.783 --> 38:05.243
You’re a delight to have.

38:05.285 --> 38:06.703
This season, I’ve
definitely come a long way.

38:06.745 --> 38:08.455
-Cheers, Captain Sandy.
-Mwah!

38:08.496 --> 38:11.666
I’ve learned that I need
to be more assertive.

38:11.708 --> 38:13.084
Courtney, I’m leaving now.

38:13.126 --> 38:14.085
No...

38:14.127 --> 38:15.795
Thanks so much for
all your help.

38:15.837 --> 38:17.005
No, thank you, it’s been
an incredible season.

38:17.047 --> 38:19.466
-It’s been so much fun.
-It has.

38:19.507 --> 38:21.509
Thanks, bud.

38:21.551 --> 38:23.928
From here, I want to do my
yacht master’s

38:23.970 --> 38:26.222
and then I would like
to see myself become a bosun,

38:26.264 --> 38:27.474
like my brother.

38:27.515 --> 38:29.017
-You crushed it.
-I love you, mate.

38:29.059 --> 38:32.687
[bleep] me, I’m excited
for the future.

38:32.729 --> 38:34.272
Here you go, here,
I’ll take that.

38:34.314 --> 38:36.274
-I’ve got it, Dave.
-You have this, I’ll take that.

38:36.316 --> 38:37.525
Bless you!

38:37.567 --> 38:39.319
-Cap.
-Hi.

38:39.361 --> 38:41.988
I can honestly say being with
you, it was never a day’s job,

38:42.030 --> 38:43.948
it was passion every
single day, waking up.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.368
I could see that every time
you were on,

38:46.409 --> 38:47.619
so thank you for that.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.287
Thank you.

38:49.329 --> 38:51.998
Holy sh--,
I can’t believe I made it.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.166
Woo-hoo!

38:53.208 --> 38:56.044
I got a hole in my pants,
no one told me.

38:56.086 --> 38:58.296
[laughing]

38:58.338 --> 39:02.175
Oh, let’s cuddle
under the blanket!

39:02.217 --> 39:05.303
After this, I’m looking
forward to seeing Frank.

39:05.345 --> 39:06.846
Woo!

39:10.016 --> 39:11.851
Let’s all keep in good
faith that things

39:11.893 --> 39:13.144
will happen after this season,

39:13.186 --> 39:14.521
and there’s only one
way to find out,

39:14.562 --> 39:16.231
and that’s a one-way ticket
to New York.

39:16.272 --> 39:19.693
If that’s fireworks as well,
it’s in the bag.

39:19.734 --> 39:22.070
-I love you, Kyle.
-Love you, babe.

39:23.071 --> 39:24.531
-Capitano.
-Courtney.

39:24.572 --> 39:26.741
You’re such an asset to
any boat, and I mean that.

39:26.783 --> 39:28.118
You work so hard on deck,

39:28.159 --> 39:30.328
and then you’re serving
on the inside.

39:30.370 --> 39:31.663
Keep going.

39:31.705 --> 39:33.039
Thank you so much, honestly,

39:33.081 --> 39:34.666
it’s been such
an amazing season.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.001
Yeah.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.003
I am really proud of myself
for this season.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.340
And to be made lead deckhand,

39:42.382 --> 39:44.759
like, I feel like
I’ve learned a lot about myself.

39:53.768 --> 39:55.520
-Hi.
-Hello...

39:55.562 --> 39:56.688
hi, Sandy, I’m leaving.

39:56.730 --> 39:58.815
It was such a pleasure.

39:58.857 --> 40:01.067
Likewise, thank you for
such a wonderful season.

40:01.109 --> 40:04.237
Yeah, thank you for
bringing the level of service

40:04.279 --> 40:05.864
that you brought
to the table.

40:05.905 --> 40:09.159
I never saw you lose
your temper or spiral.

40:09.200 --> 40:13.038
Like, you just
showed up every day.

40:13.079 --> 40:17.375
I never had to worry about
service, so thanks for that.

40:17.417 --> 40:20.795
I just never had to worry about
anything, because I had you.

40:20.837 --> 40:22.088
Aw.

40:22.130 --> 40:23.298
All right, well,
it’s been wonderful.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.549
-Okay.
-I’ll see you later.

40:24.591 --> 40:25.759
-All right.
-Bye.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.052
Bye.

40:30.513 --> 40:32.223
I’m leaving the building.

40:32.265 --> 40:33.350
Oh sh--.

40:33.391 --> 40:36.394
The first time
in a decade I’m single.

40:36.436 --> 40:38.980
-It’s not been easy, has it?
-No.

40:39.022 --> 40:40.398
But we got there and we did it,

40:40.440 --> 40:41.900
and we made it
through to the end,

40:41.941 --> 40:43.735
so it just shows how strong
we actually are.

40:43.777 --> 40:46.029
Are you gonna be able
to carry all this?

40:49.574 --> 40:50.575
-You sure?
-Yeah.

40:50.617 --> 40:52.452
I’ve learned a lot about myself.

40:52.494 --> 40:55.288
I’ve learned to stand up
for myself more,

40:55.330 --> 40:58.541
I’ve learned not to
have more man drama

40:58.583 --> 41:00.335
and just be more
open in general.

41:00.377 --> 41:03.755
I just feel like
the future’s exciting now,

41:03.797 --> 41:05.382
and I have a lot
to look forward to.

41:12.472 --> 41:13.556
Finding a man.

41:19.562 --> 41:21.523
Jokes.

41:21.564 --> 41:22.732
Thank you so much, Sandy.

41:22.774 --> 41:24.651
Yeah, you kept
your galley clean,

41:24.693 --> 41:27.862
the art that you
brought to the food...

41:27.904 --> 41:28.863
thank you.

41:28.905 --> 41:30.115
It means a lot.

41:30.156 --> 41:31.408
-You’ve got my number.
-Yeah.

41:31.449 --> 41:32.701
-Yeah.
-I’ll see you around, then.

41:32.742 --> 41:34.369
-Yeah, awesome.
-Stay safe.

41:34.411 --> 41:36.121
Definitely haven’t been able
to be myself this season.

41:36.162 --> 41:38.540
I’ve literally been
treading water the whole season.

41:38.581 --> 41:42.669
I feel like I won’t ever
get the conversation

41:42.711 --> 41:44.337
I’m looking for from Tash.

41:44.379 --> 41:47.424
I’m terrified it’s gonna be
the last time I see her.

41:47.465 --> 41:50.135
Regardless of what’s happened,
I care about her.

41:50.176 --> 41:51.428
I want the best for her.

41:51.469 --> 41:53.513
Goodbye, eh?

41:53.555 --> 41:55.432
It’s goodbye.

41:55.473 --> 41:56.599
----ing hell.

41:56.641 --> 41:58.143
I’m gonna say goodbye
to Captain Sandy

41:58.184 --> 42:00.186
and then my bag’s
the little pink one.

42:00.228 --> 42:01.813
Oh, no!

42:01.855 --> 42:04.107
Oh!

42:04.149 --> 42:06.317
What an amazing human being.

42:06.359 --> 42:08.319
You are such a joy every day.

42:08.361 --> 42:09.237
Thank you.

42:09.279 --> 42:10.488
Because you really bring light.

42:10.530 --> 42:11.364
Okay.

42:11.406 --> 42:14.451
-Gosh. Bye!
-Mwah, bye.

42:16.411 --> 42:17.787
Aw...

42:17.829 --> 42:18.997
Well, we know who’s the most
upset out of both of us.

42:19.039 --> 42:20.999
-Who?
-Well, you.

42:21.041 --> 42:24.210
-Why?
-I’m gonna miss you.

42:24.252 --> 42:26.004
I don’t wanna cry,
so I’m just gonna...

42:26.046 --> 42:27.756
I had a lot of fun with you.

42:27.797 --> 42:29.841
I’m gonna miss you.

42:29.883 --> 42:31.593
I’m sad to say
goodbye to Storm.

42:31.634 --> 42:33.595
Like, it’s crazy, because,
like, you learn to, like...

42:33.636 --> 42:35.388
you’re living with this person,
you’re working with them,

42:35.430 --> 42:37.390
like, they’re, like, a
little bit of a part of you.

42:37.432 --> 42:40.810
-You keep in contact.
-I definitely will.

42:40.852 --> 42:42.729
But, like, at
the end of the day,

42:42.771 --> 42:44.856
I don’t think he is my person.

42:44.898 --> 42:47.734
All right, just walk on,
don’t look back.

42:47.776 --> 42:49.652
I’ll see you on the flip side.

42:49.694 --> 42:50.695
See ya later, skater.

42:50.737 --> 42:52.072
Nat knows how I feel.

42:52.113 --> 42:54.115
I’ve obviously grown
very fond of her.

42:54.157 --> 42:55.950
This is so tragic.

42:55.992 --> 42:59.079
Maybe we’ll see each other
in the future, who knows?

43:05.043 --> 43:06.544
I’m outta here.

43:06.586 --> 43:08.546
-Thank you so much for...
-Yeah.

43:08.588 --> 43:10.882
...a wonderful season,
and for giving me

43:10.924 --> 43:12.217
the opportunity that I got.

43:12.258 --> 43:14.344
I’ll forever be grateful.

43:14.386 --> 43:15.762
I know I made the right choice.

43:15.804 --> 43:16.888
You did an amazing job.

43:16.930 --> 43:18.431
-Like...
-Thanks, Cap.

43:18.473 --> 43:21.059
Your growth through this period
was incredible to witness.

43:21.101 --> 43:24.229
You’re a great bosun, and
I’d have you back any day.

43:24.270 --> 43:25.730
Thank you, Cap,
I wish you the best.

43:25.772 --> 43:26.731
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

43:26.773 --> 43:28.233
Thank you.

43:28.274 --> 43:29.442
Travel safely, and thank you
for everything again.

43:29.484 --> 43:30.485
Yeah. Thank you.

43:30.527 --> 43:32.153
I joined the season
as a deckhand

43:32.195 --> 43:36.324
and I got promoted to bosun,
and it was intense.

43:36.366 --> 43:37.742
I’ve learned a lot about myself,

43:37.784 --> 43:40.078
how I may come across

43:40.120 --> 43:42.622
when I’m under a certain amount
of stress.

43:42.664 --> 43:43.873
My dream is to be a captain,

43:43.915 --> 43:45.917
just doing dive
and surf charters,

43:45.959 --> 43:47.961
and just really living.

43:52.298 --> 43:54.009
This season we
went through a lot,

43:54.050 --> 43:57.262
but to end how we ended
was incredible.

43:57.303 --> 43:59.723
In a perfect world,
we learn through our mistakes.

43:59.764 --> 44:02.851
This crew did that in
so many different ways.

44:02.892 --> 44:08.106
To grow is to succeed,
and this season was a success.

44:08.148 --> 44:10.066
Another one down.
