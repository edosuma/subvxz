[upbeat music playing]

01:47.274 --> 01:48.440
We're all a family.
You know?

01:48.442 --> 01:51.877
- To us.
- All: Cheers.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.812
Izzie:
We're a weird

01:53.814 --> 01:56.515
tight-knit group
of fucked up people

01:56.517 --> 01:57.883
who found each other
in this town.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.359
Reed: Hey, Reed Worlders!
Thank you so much for tuning in!

02:07.361 --> 02:08.594
I hope that you are liking
the festival coverage

02:08.596 --> 02:10.128
this summer
that we've had so far.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.597
I have so much more
coming up for you

02:11.599 --> 02:14.266
including an interview with
The Rift & Le Youth!

02:14.268 --> 02:17.269
So look forward to that
in the next few weeks.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.904
Also, this weekend is
1/2 New Year.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.672
because
it's the last Saturday
in June.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.374
So make sure
you celebrate with
your friends.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.643
You have six months in,
you got six months more to go.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.445
All of my shows
are now gonna be brought to you

02:26.447 --> 02:29.448
by Infinite CBD,
which is my favorite CBD oil,

02:29.450 --> 02:31.617
and I'm putting the link
down in the bio

02:31.619 --> 02:33.485
as well as a little discount.
Go for it.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.588
And make sure that you like,
subscribe and share.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.441
[laughs] Oh.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.277
What're you doing?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.478
I was fucking...

02:59.480 --> 03:00.812
- Ewe.
- Myself.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.915
- Gross.
- No, I'm on a bike.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.784
Well, what happened to
"I'll call you when I'm done"?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.486
I know, I know,
it took forever.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.621
And then my mom called,
so it was like this whole thing.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.889
Got it.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.758
Is it gonna be like
champagne time

03:12.760 --> 03:15.194
or like shitty tequila,
straight from the bottle?

03:15.196 --> 03:17.729
- Pop that bubbly.
- Damn.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.232
Oh good.
Dude, I knew you'd crush it.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.901
Thanks for helping me study.
Those flash cards saved my life.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.770
Yeah. I'm the,
I'm the king of that...

03:24.772 --> 03:26.838
flash carding and shit.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.940
Yeah.
Soon it's gonna be like,

03:27.942 --> 03:29.575
"Oh, our favorite vet tech,

03:29.577 --> 03:31.710
Brynn, will take
your pup to the back now.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.313
Can you just
surround me with puppies for
the rest of my life, please?

03:34.315 --> 03:35.547
That's all I want.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.616
Are you gonna die
an old dog lady?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.484
Um, I mean, at this point,
it's the best case scenario.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.620
So, yeah, probably.

03:41.622 --> 03:42.821
I got the sponsorship.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.456
- Shut the fuck up!
- I swear.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.991
All you need to do
is just get a few more sponsors,

03:45.993 --> 03:48.427
and then, like maybe in a year
you can quit your job.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.230
- Uh. Things are happening.
- I know.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.398
We're really doing it.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.733
Uh, listen.
I'm gonna get ready.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.335
- Okay, have fun on your bike.
- Bye.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.470
- Fuck you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.947
- You're not dressed?
- I am skipping it, man.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.016
Nah, it's not a good idea.
I'm not gonna let you isolate.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.651
- So nice try.
- Look.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.620
I don't need the whole world
that I fucked up,

04:14.622 --> 04:16.454
- okay?
- All right.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.324
But you're not the only person
who's ever gotten fired before.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.659
And, also,

04:20.661 --> 04:22.661
if I put the tail
between your legs,

04:22.663 --> 04:24.997
it's kinda like
you have this like
lion dick thing,

04:24.999 --> 04:26.398
like a hairy beefy,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.900
like dick tail,
like a lion dick,

04:28.902 --> 04:31.870
like a,
like a meat hairy cock lunch,

04:31.872 --> 04:33.805
lion sandwich.

04:33.807 --> 04:37.342
You're like the shittiest
version of Simba imaginable.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.612
Dude...

04:40.614 --> 04:42.281
- Dude, please don't text her,
- Ah...

04:42.283 --> 04:44.049
I gotta make one.
- [outgoing text tone sounds]

04:44.051 --> 04:46.418
Who uses their birth date
as their passcode?

04:46.420 --> 04:47.886
[incoming text tone sounds]

04:47.888 --> 04:49.621
Well, she's in.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.291
So, brush your teeth,
wash your face, get lion'd out

04:52.293 --> 04:54.493
and, um,
let's have a nice party.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.329
What do you say?
Huh? Huh?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.632
I don't know how the fuck
you do this shit.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.067
It's a gift and a curse.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.503
Uh, drink time.
Oh!

05:04.505 --> 05:06.838
[music playing]

05:06.840 --> 05:08.440
[Blake]
All right, guys.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.543
Happy 1/2 New Year.

05:11.545 --> 05:16.315
[music playing loudly]

05:16.317 --> 05:17.749
Cheers. Woo!

05:26.894 --> 05:28.527
Light it up.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.395
Light it up!

05:30.397 --> 05:32.397
All:
[chanting] Light it up!

05:32.399 --> 05:34.733
Girl:
Don't you just love the way
LA brings people together.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.802
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.805
Because, you know,
just, it has to do with,
you know, survival.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.506
You know,
it really depends on that.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.508
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, absolutely.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.843
Um... Well,
uh, you know what?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.545
I need a, a drink.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.847
Why don't
you go, go that way.
Just, yeah.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.549
See you in a bit.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.050
Oh, thank-- thanks.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.420
- Nice one.
- Hi.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.389
- Who was that?
- I have no fucking idea.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.790
Where is Bishop?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.093
- Uh, probably hiding.
- Probably hiding? Okay?

06:01.095 --> 06:03.795
Uh, go pour
a shot down his throat
and find me later.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.431
- Funny.
- Oh, funny.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.013
I fricken love this life.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.782
You look good
for a tiger.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.921
[sighs]

06:31.024 --> 06:32.991
Hiya Chilly.
Long time no see.

06:32.993 --> 06:38.630
[background chatter]

06:38.632 --> 06:40.499
Are you gonna...

06:40.501 --> 06:41.833
Oh, you're so loud right now.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.168
- Just shut up.
- Screening your calls?

06:43.170 --> 06:44.536
- Oh.
- Oh.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.871
Looks like
you didn't miss me much.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.974
Oh my God!
You made it.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.509
MM, you're late.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.843
Yeah.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.545
- Ooh.
- Ut oh.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.414
I have got to go take this.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.815
- Man about a horse.
- Take it.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.650
- Girl?
- Drugs.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.552
Oh, because this is such
a special occasion?

07:00.554 --> 07:01.853
- Don't be Judgy.
- Yeah.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.555
Well, drugs are bad, okay?
- [together] Mm.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.790
You know that I work more than
80 hours a week, right?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.525
No.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.526
Yeah, and I get maybe five times
a year that I get high?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.960
- Five?
- And Coachella,

07:08.962 --> 07:11.163
but that counts as one,
so it's still five.

07:11.165 --> 07:12.964
Okay, you're being
annoying right now.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.499
- Do you want to drink?
- Yes. Okay.

07:14.501 --> 07:15.834
Okay.
Let's go get you your own

07:15.836 --> 07:17.803
'cause you can't have
that whole thing.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.672
You're gonna be
puking later, and I'm not
cleaning that up again.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.148
Fuck. You scared
the shit out of me, babe.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.053
That's it.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.121
I'm done.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.158
What are you,
what are you talking about?

07:40.160 --> 07:43.161
I saw you
getting into that same sedan.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.533
Come on, babe.
That is not...

07:48.535 --> 07:50.535
at all what it looks like.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.204
Really?

07:52.206 --> 07:53.839
Because this is what
it looks like.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.707
I got it for the party.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.509
I may do
a couple of lines
with Reed.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.778
- That's it.
- That's what you said
last time.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.746
And then you went on
a bender all night

08:01.748 --> 08:03.748
and spent the next
morning crying in my lap

08:03.750 --> 08:05.116
telling me how you don't
wanna do this anymore.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.651
Look. I get it.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.187
That is not
going to happen this time.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.489
Okay?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.859
You said you wanted
to marry me.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.530
I do want
to marry you, babe.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.832
You're not the same
when you're all coked out.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.269
You're a dick to me
and to all of your friends.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.806
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life with that, Josh.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.875
I don't even
want to be fucking friends
with that Josh.

08:29.877 --> 08:33.010
- I am not that Josh.
- No, you're not.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.946
And that's what
I'm afraid of.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.994
Okay.

08:52.599 --> 08:56.167
[upbeat music playing]

08:56.169 --> 08:58.236
[cheering]

08:58.238 --> 09:00.105
- Yeah, baby.
- You're making a mess.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.706
Bishop, get off my dick.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.842
Everybody, yo!

09:03.844 --> 09:06.811
- Happy 1/2 New Year.
- All: Woo!

09:09.616 --> 09:12.617
You guys are super coked out
right now, huh?

09:12.619 --> 09:13.952
Emma.
Emma.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.720
Emma.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.290
We put things up our noses.
We enjoy our youth.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.158
That's us.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.327
That girl over there
is eye-fucking the shit
out of you.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.329
I bet you 20 bucks
she's not wearing panties.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.997
That's Megan.
She lives across the street.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.099
- Okay, so hit it.
- She's not really my type.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.301
If you do not fuck her,

09:29.303 --> 09:31.002
we cannot be friends.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.771
Reed:
You can't live without me.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.639
Half true.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.974
Okay.
What you got for me?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.943
Um, Kevin Chandler
is single again.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.110
- Mm-mm.
- Uh-huh.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.612
- No.
- Uh-huh.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.846
- What do I do?
- Uh, well considering

09:41.848 --> 09:43.582
you're wearing panties,

09:43.584 --> 09:45.083
just boomerang 'em
into his face.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.886
- Ewe, that's gross.
- I need more of this.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.220
Just be you.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.755
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.057
- Go team.
- All right. Go get 'em, tiger.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.758
- Lion.
- Rarrr.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.597
Does it really
make you feel sexy?

09:58.599 --> 10:01.266
Why, you wanna,
wanna have a little taste?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.801
Wanna have a little taste?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.970
Ooh! You crazy.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.272
You gettin' crazy
up in here.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.974
Oh, okay.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.308
Up the shoot.
Up the shoot.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.843
Dude, my sister
is right over there.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.078
Fuck her.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.613
That's, that's great.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.947
- Bro.
- You should just continue to...

10:15.949 --> 10:18.116
Okay, that's disgusting.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.985
- Hey.
- Is not great.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.853
Are you okay?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.688
I'm fucking great.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.190
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.725
You just seem a little...

10:28.929 --> 10:30.261
I'm a big fucking boy.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.797
Okay, I'm just
checking on you.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.133
Okay, stop doing so much.
Why don't you get a drink? Okay?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.835
I'm gonna do
whatever the fuck
I want to do.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.703
- All right, then.
- Okay? You hang tight.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.205
Okay. I will.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.310
And what
just went up your nose?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.978
- My allowance.
- Be careful.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.747
- Yes, dad.
- So...

10:48.749 --> 10:50.048
what's your
1/2 New Year resolution?

10:50.050 --> 10:52.384
Um, to get out
more to nature

10:52.386 --> 10:54.085
- and get her off my phone.
- Yeah, that's happening.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.420
It can happen.
What's yours?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.188
Mm, stop eating hoagies.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.125
- I'm getting fat ass.
- Again?

11:00.127 --> 11:01.660
It can happen.
Yeah.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.094
Guys.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.262
Countdown.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.333
All:
Ten, nine,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.435
eight, seven, six,

11:10.437 --> 11:12.704
five, four, three,

11:12.706 --> 11:14.205
two, one...

11:14.207 --> 11:17.742
Happy 1/2 New Year!

11:32.459 --> 11:33.992
What's the matter?
Calm down.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.393
- Calm down.
- I need everyone

11:35.395 --> 11:36.861
- to get the fuck out.
- Dude, you're just...

11:36.863 --> 11:38.363
- You don't fucking get it.
- Stop.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.864
I don't want everyone
to see him like this.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.866
Everyone outside
for the fireworks.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.468
Reed:
Chill out.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.136
You all right?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.440
Dude, chill out.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.041
You're okay.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.910
- Put down the fucking camera.
- No way, dude.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.845
Dude, turn the camera off.
Please?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.780
Dude, put down
the fucking camera.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.015
I'm gonna show you this
when you're sober,

11:57.017 --> 11:58.883
and you're gonna
fucking see it.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.351
Stop, stop, stop.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.453
Ugh!

12:03.924 --> 12:05.790
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

12:05.792 --> 12:08.026
You fucking crazy?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.832
Josh!

12:18.905 --> 12:20.939
It's okay.
It's okay, babe.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.006
It's okay.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.476
It's okay.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.223
I know, mom.
It's a 36 hour drive.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.291
I did it five years ago,
remember?

12:45.766 --> 12:47.766
Can you
not stress me out
right now?

12:47.768 --> 12:50.101
I got a lot
of shit to do.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.436
I got to go.
I love you.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.871
Bye.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.211
Knock, knock.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.080
Mom's gonna
drive me to drink.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.481
What'd she say now?

13:03.483 --> 13:05.884
She's worried about me
driving cross-country.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.453
Well, then tell
mommy to pay to have all your
shit shipped over.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.456
God, she has been begging you
to move home for five years.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.159
If she wants something so bad,
maybe she should do it herself.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.294
Still pissed at her?

13:16.296 --> 13:17.428
No.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.332
I brought wine.
Want some?

13:21.334 --> 13:24.302
The girls and I
are gonna watch Real Housewives
reruns and talk shit.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.472
When was the last time you saw
me drinking anything alcoholic?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.941
Maybe that's your problem, Reed.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.010
You've been in this ridiculous
funk for almost a year.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.878
And to be honest,

13:33.880 --> 13:37.448
sometimes you're a real fucking
pain in the ass to be around.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.050
- You can leave now, Pam.
- Ah, what?

13:39.052 --> 13:41.085
a dose of reality
too hard for you?

13:41.087 --> 13:42.987
By, Pam.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.826
He's in a mood.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.327
Again.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.029
Be careful.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.096
I know.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.431
I know.
She's my sister.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.300
She's just trying to help.
I get it.

13:55.302 --> 13:58.236
- Yeah.
- I get it.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.571
I brought tequila.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.940
Mm.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.474
Just have a drink with me.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.476
I have a lot of packing to do.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.846
This might be the last time
we get to do this.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.050
- You know we'll
still talk, right?
- Yeah, of course.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.918
And then you'll get busy
and then I'll get busy,

14:13.920 --> 14:15.386
and then it'll be
next year at the 1/2
New Year's party

14:15.388 --> 14:17.155
and I'll be like,
"I don't know Reed. Who's Reed?"

14:17.157 --> 14:18.323
That's not true.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.191
- That's not true at all.
- Okay.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.927
So get your dick
out of your pussy and have
a drink with me.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.000
- Glasses, ice?
- All of the above.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.074
There's this one time
this girl pulled her hair.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.442
- Scary.
- Whoa.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.977
Come hangout with us, Reed.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.112
Um, Brynn's
gonna help me pack.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.115
You know you
could always say fuck packing
and just stay here in LA.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.119
Softer touches.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.621
He needs a swift kick
in the ass.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.155
Shut up.
Bishop's studying.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.024
Whatever.
Your boyfriend's a dork.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.025
Anyways.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.260
I know.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.528
- Finally.
- Hmm.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.497
You gonna fold my clothes
for me or what?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.266
- You wish.
- I pour.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.469
That's more than enough.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.005
You can finish
the rest of this.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.640
Okay.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.642
- To your life in LA.
- Yes.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.011
Though it was paved with
heartbreak and a mass layoff,

15:13.013 --> 15:16.314
it was for filled with
a lot of great memories.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.548
Cheers.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.154
And you'll always
have a home here.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.156
And I'm drunk.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.325
With Blake and Bishop.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.693
- And Josh.
- Hey.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.716
[upbeat music playing]

16:08.668 --> 16:11.369
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.538
- Is there coffee?
- French roast.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.207
Oh, you're too good to me.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.375
Avocado toast?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.377
Yeah.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.313
Oh, you did it
the way I like it.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.982
Is everything
ready for tonight?

16:23.984 --> 16:25.650
Yeah, yeah just,
uh, you know,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.352
decorations, DJ,

16:27.354 --> 16:29.454
just need help setting up.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.722
Where is everyone?

16:30.724 --> 16:32.490
They're still sleeping.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.459
What about the surprise?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.427
Right, uh...

16:36.429 --> 16:38.129
I think he'll love it.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.164
You know, he'll pretend
to hate it, but he'll love it.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.534
You know,
I still love you, right?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.603
Nothing's changed.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.774
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.579
This is so fucked up.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.180
Izzie:
It was just the whiskey.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.515
This is the fifth time.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.616
I know that.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.653
- Was it me?
- Obviously not.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.622
Well, last year,
we were all over each other.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.191
So, what, you're
saying you liked me better
when I needed a bump

17:07.193 --> 17:08.659
- in the morning to get going?
- I don't know.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.294
What do you want me to say?
It was better then.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.796
It's still good.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.664
We haven't had sex in a month.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.700
Look. I'm just going through
some shit right now, okay?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.201
We'll get back on track.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.736
Yeah.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.238
I'm sure we will.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.711
Together:
I think we should break up.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.759
And why are you in my bed?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.461
I can't hear you.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.797
I'm pretending to sleep.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.298
You know the rules.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.300
No sex, no bed.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.669
What?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.504
Where'd we end up last night?

17:59.846 --> 18:01.379
Did you blackout?

18:01.381 --> 18:03.414
No.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.083
You don't remember anything?

18:05.085 --> 18:07.852
It's foggy.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.488
We finished
four bottles of wine.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.823
Oh, fuck.
Why did you let me do that?

18:11.825 --> 18:13.524
I have so much packing to do.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.759
You're so loud.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.761
I got a pee.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.496
Just don't be a crybaby.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.857
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

18:45.859 --> 18:48.126
- You're a pig!
- I'm sorry.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.162
Marty?

18:51.164 --> 18:52.864
What the fuck
did you do to my sister?

18:52.866 --> 18:54.565
- He didn't do anything to me.
- You mean, you let him?

18:54.567 --> 18:56.267
What's it to you?

18:56.269 --> 18:57.602
Fucking Marty?

18:57.604 --> 18:59.303
Oh, I have seen the girls
you've boned.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.538
You let him bone you?

19:00.540 --> 19:01.672
Out!

19:01.674 --> 19:03.741
- You're fucking dead.
- Out!

19:08.148 --> 19:10.414
So, like what happened?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.918
- What do you mean?
- Ah, we were on the couch,

19:13.920 --> 19:15.786
we're watching a movie,
and then...

19:15.788 --> 19:17.655
Yeah, and then you passed out
on the couch,

19:17.657 --> 19:19.857
and I took a vantage
of your empty bed so.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.859
But then I woke up
and I came in here?

19:21.861 --> 19:23.661
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.
I was pretty drunk, too.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.363
Oh, okay.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.698
Um, well, I have a lot
of packing to do.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.567
And I have boot camp.
You know Pam.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.902
I do.
Um, I'll see you tonight.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.436
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

19:32.438 --> 19:33.905
- Okay.
- Okay.

Get me stoned,
get me a hoagie,

19:41.281 --> 19:42.914
get me anything to get rid
of this hangover.

Sex dick?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.560
I don't understand.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.428
I mean,
why would she just...

19:57.430 --> 19:59.764
Hello, sex dick?
English please.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.400
Pam, it's latex, lube,

20:02.402 --> 20:03.768

on your business.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.536
You had sex with Brynn.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.440
I don't remember any of it.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.242
Hey.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.643
This is a good thing.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.979
I always knew you guys
would end up together.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.982
She was gonna walk out
and act like nothing happened.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.984
Oh.
I'll talk to her.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.353
No, you won't talk to her.
You won't say anything.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.688
You won't say anything
to any of the girls,

20:23.690 --> 20:25.690
- to anyone else.
- Fine!

20:25.692 --> 20:27.758
My lips are sealed.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.736
Can I borrow a shirt of yours?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.271
No. We just broke up.
I'm not gonna let you
borrow anything.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.340
My dress smells like beer.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.878
Oh, oh, really?
So you're 13 now?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.747
Here.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.349
I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

if you're naked.

Oh, okay.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.861
brush your teeth,

21:03.863 --> 21:05.563
wash your bones.
One of those is not optional,

21:05.565 --> 21:06.731
by the way.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.266
Come out here and help me.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.600
And, what the hell
was that?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.736
- Nothing.
- Okay.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.738
You're lying to me.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.439
Hurts.

that I'm going to be

and back to my hometown
of Philadelphia.

you want to be closer
to your family.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.975
Okay, then don't say that.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.745
It's just not fun to admit
that you're a failure.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.914
Dude, you're not a failure.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.015
You're just...

22:31.017 --> 22:33.651
You're just broke, okay?

22:33.653 --> 22:36.120
So go home, save up,
and come back.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.822
I mean, does anyone
listen to me?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.657
You don't just go home
and come back.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.992
You get ties, you get a job,
you get responsibilities.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.862
You just
become my parents,
basically.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.530
Look.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.033
Can you at least fake a smile?
Like a small one?

22:49.035 --> 22:50.735
It's gonna be fun.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.471
I promise.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.973
- I'll be in my room.
- Dude.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.510
I can't get through to him.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.845
I know.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.483
You know,
Josh would know what to say.

23:05.485 --> 23:06.751
I know.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.592
Can I get you anything else?

23:18.731 --> 23:20.431
Well, that just cured
my hangover.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.799
Ooh, that guy is salty.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.601
Be still my ovaries.

23:23.603 --> 23:24.969
Did you see him
eye fuck your tits?

23:24.971 --> 23:26.570
Why didn't he do it with mine?

23:26.572 --> 23:29.073
Um, you have
marijuana porn on your shirt.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.076
I've hit rock bottom.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.979
Okay. I'm circling
what everyone owes,
23% tip included,

23:34.981 --> 23:36.547
20% is normal

23:36.549 --> 23:39.083
but 3% extra
because I mean,

23:39.085 --> 23:40.851
look at him.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.620
You're like a sexy rain man.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.922
I'm just smarter
than your average bear.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.424
Okay, you need to leave
your number on the table

23:46.426 --> 23:48.426
- when we go.
- No, don't do that.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.060
No, I'm not in the mood.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.062
All right. I'm just
gonna call him over here

23:52.064 --> 23:56.000
and tell him
that Brynn wants to do very
dirty things to him.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.637
- She slept with Reed.
- What, Reed?

23:59.639 --> 24:00.938
Why didn't you tell us?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.574
Because he said
he didn't remember.

24:03.576 --> 24:06.076
- Are you sure?
- He honestly doesn't remember.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.012
And told you
all the details of something
he doesn't remember.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.848
- Mm-hmm.
- No, he sort of figured it out.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.819
Have you girls
ever heard of sex dick?

24:15.621 --> 24:18.122
Oh.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.725
[music playing]

24:35.475 --> 24:37.007
Fuck.
This is crazy.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.748
[knocking on door]

24:48.621 --> 24:50.955
Hi. Um, I may have
the wrong house.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.957
I'm looking
for a Josh Mackey.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.192
You're Blake, right?

24:55.194 --> 24:56.727
Yeah.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.629
I had an entire premonition

24:58.631 --> 25:01.866
about this
during our meditation today.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.033
I'm so glad to see you.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.535
Come here.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.036
Hugging.

25:06.038 --> 25:09.039
I can tell by your aura

25:09.041 --> 25:12.009
that you're a good person,

25:12.011 --> 25:13.944
very compassionate and I,

25:13.946 --> 25:16.814
I know you're
going to do the right thing.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.049
Thank you.
Yeah. I could see that.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.952
It's a greenish purple,
by the way.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.053
This?

25:23.055 --> 25:25.222
Your aura, yeah.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.291
Okay. Um, I'm gonna run.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.862
Call me later, okay?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.564
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:36.602 --> 25:37.668
Dude.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.872
You look good, man.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.007
Thanks man. Same.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.875
How'd you, uh,

25:44.877 --> 25:46.710
how'd you know
where to find me?

25:46.712 --> 25:49.079
Bishop's been
talking to your mom so.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.614
- Yeah.
- She gave us the address.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.316
Of course she did.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.718
Shit.
I'm so rude, man.
Come on in.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.854
- Please.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.995
This place is great.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.063
Thank you, man.
Thank you.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.731
It's, uh,

26:07.733 --> 26:09.700
it's a quiet neighborhood,
but it's so nice here.

26:09.702 --> 26:12.102
Yeah, it's a lot nicer
than ours actually.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.172
Well, I mean,
you live in a child's
playpen so.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.242
So are you
gonna ask me or...?

26:18.244 --> 26:20.878
What're you talking about?

26:20.880 --> 26:23.047
Come on, man.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.215
Look. I'm not,

26:25.217 --> 26:26.884
I'm not on any medication,

26:26.886 --> 26:28.152
and I'm, I'm doing okay,

26:28.154 --> 26:29.320
I'm doing better,

26:29.322 --> 26:32.022
and, um,

26:32.024 --> 26:34.024
fuck man,
I just want to,

26:34.026 --> 26:36.627
I just wanted to say sorry
for so long.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.128
Listen man, no judgment.
All right.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.798
I was in a pretty shitty
spot last year myself.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.733
I appreciate that.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.903
The hippie chick was cute.

26:45.905 --> 26:48.772
Uh, no she's,
she's been, uh,

26:48.774 --> 26:50.007
pretty she's been
pretty pivotal.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.109
It's a long story though.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.278
Reed's moving back to Philly.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.347
And you really think he's going?

26:56.349 --> 26:59.717
He lost his job.
He lost his sponsorship.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.852
He could use somebody
to talk to, actually.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.623
You come over here to,

27:05.625 --> 27:07.391
to ask me to just waltz back
into a party and just be like,

27:07.393 --> 27:08.826
"Hey Reed,

27:08.828 --> 27:12.296
uh, what happened sucked
and, you know,

27:12.298 --> 27:14.665
you should just stay because,

27:14.667 --> 27:16.000
because I'm here."

27:16.002 --> 27:18.068
Not in those words,
but yeah, I do.

27:24.043 --> 27:27.177
Look man.
I, I really appreciate
you swinging through.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.046
Look.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.247
You know
we all want you there.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.049
You know you should be there.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.251
Okay?
And if not,

27:34.253 --> 27:36.720
well, maybe we'll see you
in another year.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.300
[cell phone ringing]

27:57.410 --> 27:59.276
Oh hi, it's you.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.979
I was just thinking about you.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.347
So how'd it go?

28:08.988 --> 28:12.956
Okay, I need you
to close your eyes,

28:12.958 --> 28:15.092
now in that darkness,

28:15.094 --> 28:17.928
I want you
to look at your soul.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.997
And I want you
to talk to your soul...

28:24.403 --> 28:27.271
Okay, okay,
I'm gonna be right over, okay?

28:27.273 --> 28:30.808
I'll bring all your favorite
warm calming oils

28:30.810 --> 28:32.476
and essentials.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.478
It'll be great, okay?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.180
Now don't isolate.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.715
Come on.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.249
This is what I'm here for.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.823
We've already been doing this
for 19 minutes and 35 seconds.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.825
Isn't that enough time
to make a difference?

28:47.827 --> 28:49.493
You counted that in your head?

28:49.495 --> 28:51.028
I can't help it.
It just happens.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.896
I can't believe Reed's leaving.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.365
We begged him to stay.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.501
- Like it's that easy.
- Just don't even think about

28:57.503 --> 29:00.037
getting into
a long-distance
relationship.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.371
What's so bad about a
long-distance relationship?

29:01.373 --> 29:04.775
Everything. No kissing.
No cuddling, no fucking.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.844
- It sucks.
- And no sucking either.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.846
Why are you
in such a bad mood anyways?

29:08.848 --> 29:10.748
I'm in a great mood.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.250
I'm too old for this shit.
Who wants a beer?

29:13.252 --> 29:15.085
- I'll make mimosas.
- I'll help.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.955
Hey! I'm not done
with you skinny bitches yet.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.823
- You're doing great.
- Hey, does anybody

29:19.825 --> 29:21.825
want to go halfsies
on some blow tonight?

29:21.827 --> 29:23.160
I thought you stopped doing that
when you and Blake got together?

29:23.162 --> 29:26.263
Yeah, well,
Blake and I broke up so.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.265
Get me a fucking drink.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.067
[woman]
How you feeling?
Are you feeling good?

29:30.069 --> 29:32.236
That's right...

29:34.206 --> 29:37.241
You are doing
a terrible job at packing.
You know that, right?

29:37.243 --> 29:39.209
Are you here to help

29:39.211 --> 29:40.811
or to judge?

29:45.317 --> 29:46.416
Thanks.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.526
Can you YouTube packing?

29:57.329 --> 29:58.529
We should do drugs.

29:58.531 --> 30:00.063
What?

30:00.065 --> 30:02.332
Tonight.

30:02.334 --> 30:05.035
I don't mess with
that shit anymore.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.171
Maybe some shrooms,
maybe some molly.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.507
I do still talk to the Messiah.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.510
Yeah, yeah,
let's go see him.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.280
Okay, fine.
But don't be weird.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.881
I'm not weird,
you're weird.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.850
- You're always weird.
- I'm not weird at all.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.351
You're being weird right now
calling me weird.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.420
No, your face is weird.
Come on.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.104
I just don't understand
why a drug dealer...

30:41.106 --> 30:43.440
- Stop it.
- ...would call himself
the Messiah.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.975
Look bro,
that's his real name.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.410
You're lying to me.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.846
His mother actually thinks
he's Jesus reincarnated.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.848
- That's ridiculous.
- It's, it's insane.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.182
Oh, I love him.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.052
- My friends.
- Messiah.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.424
Friend.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.491
Hi.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.266
Come, sit.

31:09.268 --> 31:12.002
Please.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.337
Tell me,

31:13.339 --> 31:15.105
how was your
constipation enema?

31:15.107 --> 31:18.175
Um, that wasn't us.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.912
Thanks for seeing us
on such short notice.

31:21.914 --> 31:24.948
Same as last time?

31:24.950 --> 31:26.450
Yeah, something fun.

31:26.452 --> 31:27.985
Ah, yes.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.219
The good shit.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.654
Yeah.

31:33.592 --> 31:36.960
Only the finest
from the Messiah's fault.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.296
I have the cocaine.

31:39.298 --> 31:42.266
I have the ecstasy.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.368
I have the angels dust...

31:44.370 --> 31:46.236
Angel, angel dust?

31:46.238 --> 31:48.538
- Do people still do that?
- Oh, yes.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.240
Carl.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.576
Oh, I think I met him.
That kind of makes sense.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.578
- The mushrooms.
- Um...

31:54.580 --> 31:58.181
Those are always a good time,
especially in the jungle.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.683
- Yeah they, they are.
- Yeah.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.219
I think we're gonna
stick with, um, the weed,

32:02.221 --> 32:05.255
uh, some molly,
and, um,

32:05.257 --> 32:08.592
maybe just
throw in a bag of coke,
small bag of coke.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.360
- Why are you doing coke?
- Shut up.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.929
So tell me Blake,

32:11.931 --> 32:13.363
why did you
and Isabella break up?

32:13.365 --> 32:16.033
Excuse me, what?

32:16.035 --> 32:17.367
The Messiah knows all.

32:17.369 --> 32:20.003
Facebook.

32:20.005 --> 32:22.139
Are we friends?

32:22.141 --> 32:24.308
- Add me.
- Okay.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.209
Love Facebook.

32:26.211 --> 32:28.545
It just wasn't meant to be.
That's it.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.548
All things
are meant to be, my son.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.151
You're like
two years older than we are.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.420
The Messiah has no age.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.955
Oh.

32:37.957 --> 32:40.123
We both wanted it to end,
so it ended.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.725
That's, that's it.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.027
Sometimes things have to end

32:44.029 --> 32:46.730
before they can have
a new beginning.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.265
Oh my God.

32:48.267 --> 32:51.268
You're Deepak Chopra
under there, aren't you?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.337
Fuck that soggy fuck.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.977
You know,

32:59.979 --> 33:03.113
it's like the great
Will Smith always says,

33:03.115 --> 33:05.115
"If it ain't broke,

33:05.117 --> 33:07.551
don't try to fix it."

33:07.553 --> 33:09.252
- Oh yeah.
- He did.

33:09.254 --> 33:10.587
- He does say that.
- Yeah, he did say that.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.557
- Yeah.
- Um, so we're gonna pay.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.725
Do you have cash on you?

33:14.727 --> 33:16.259
Why do I have to pay?

33:16.261 --> 33:18.261
I bought you that coffee
before we got here.

33:18.263 --> 33:21.031
That was like three dollars.
It's not gonna be three dollars.

33:21.033 --> 33:24.201
- Why do I always have to get...
- Let this be a gift for you.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.105
In exchange,

33:28.107 --> 33:30.440
you let me grace you
with my presence

33:30.442 --> 33:31.742
at your party.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.579
Yes, that'd be amazing.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.547
Thank you.
Thank you, Messiah.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.249
- Thanks.
- Sweet.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.318
I'm glad you
finally slept with Brynn.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.087
You know,
when one commits
to one path,

33:44.089 --> 33:47.791
often another one
falls in front of you.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.796
Okay. Uh,
my meter's running.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.500
See you tonight.
Thank you again.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.070
I'll bring my dancing shoes.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.642
No, no, no, no.
I hate that color.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.778
- I like that color.
- It's too dark for her.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.646
What're you talking about?
Everyone looks good in black.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.348
You've never worn black
in your life.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.681
I'm quoting you.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.217
Why are you being
so argumentative?

34:14.219 --> 34:15.385
Why are you being
such a bitch?

34:15.387 --> 34:17.353
Whoa.
Okay, one, because

34:17.356 --> 34:19.222
me being a bitch
makes your life more
interesting,

34:19.224 --> 34:21.725
you're welcome.
And two, I broke up with
my boyfriend today.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.159
What's your excuse?

34:24.830 --> 34:26.696
Bishop proposed.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.565
That's great news, right?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.534
He proposed
and he didn't get you a ring?

34:33.438 --> 34:34.771
- He has it.
- Because

34:34.773 --> 34:36.572
you've said no?

34:36.574 --> 34:38.641
Well, I didn't say yes.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.284
It was beautiful
and he was so sweet

34:48.286 --> 34:50.754
but everything
flashed before me,

34:50.755 --> 34:53.290
a house, kids.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.324
And all of a sudden,
you don't want that anymore?

34:55.327 --> 34:57.527
No. I do, it's just

34:57.529 --> 35:00.163
once you do it
you're kind of stuck.

35:00.165 --> 35:01.598
What if I get depressed?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.266
What if he gets cancer?

35:03.268 --> 35:06.203
- What if her first kid gets...
- Okay, we get it.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.370
Did you guys breakup?

35:07.372 --> 35:08.772
No, of course not.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.241
I love him.
I think maybe

35:11.243 --> 35:15.512
if I really loved him,
I'd be able to do this.

35:15.514 --> 35:18.548
Okay. I just have to say,
I do not support this at all.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.884
- Izzie.
- No. This is just
like senior year.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.420
- This is nothing like that.
- What happened senior year?

35:23.422 --> 35:26.890
- That was totally different.
- She got a B- on her midterm.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.892
Took her whole GPA down,
and she quit.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.427
- And she took off a semester.
- And I came back

35:30.429 --> 35:31.628
and I busted my ass
to make it up.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.363
You were
a semester behind.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.232
You were afraid of graduating,
afraid of any change.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.834
But you and Bishop don't have
anything to be scared of.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.370
Of course they do.
Sometimes you're gonna fight.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.639
And sometimes you're gonna be
really fucking bored

35:42.641 --> 35:44.508
and one time
you might come home

35:44.510 --> 35:46.776
and he's watching porn
instead of fucking you.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.312
- Izzie!
- My point is

35:49.314 --> 35:51.648
you were scared
of graduating, too.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.750
And life after college
hasn't been perfect either.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.586
But look at you.
You're doing it.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.491
So what do I do now?

36:03.195 --> 36:05.595
Okay.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.731
Mr. Deluca,
I've been a very naughty...

36:07.733 --> 36:10.333
[gasps, screams]

36:13.338 --> 36:14.871
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.673
I thought you were Reed.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.775
No, no,
definitely not Reed.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.243
He left a bit ago.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.345
Okay, then,
I'll just wait for him.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.915
You really don't
have to wait in here.

36:24.917 --> 36:27.450
Yeah, I'm gonna wait.

36:27.452 --> 36:28.818
You're gonna wait.
You're gonna wait.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.220
All right. Cool.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.821
- 'Kay bye.
- Yeah.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.456
[groans]

36:33.458 --> 36:35.592
- Whoa.
- Oh, Reed. Hey.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.394
What're you doing in my room?

36:37.396 --> 36:39.896
Right, room.
Um, it's your room. Right.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.665
[stammering]
I was putting boxes in there.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.466
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.835
- What's the matter with you?
- Look. Megan's in there.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.470
- Great.
- Okay.

36:47.472 --> 36:50.340
She's dressed
in some sort of weird...

36:50.342 --> 36:51.908
Are you into some
like Catholic thing?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.443
- What's your deal?
- No.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.945
You're asking
a lot of questions.

36:54.947 --> 36:56.546
You really don't want
to know the answer to these,

36:56.548 --> 36:58.281
- okay? I'll handle it.
- All right.

36:58.283 --> 36:59.883
You get in there.
Get that extra credit, buddy.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.351
All right.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.670
Why didn't you call me?

37:20.672 --> 37:23.373
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you this,

37:23.375 --> 37:25.709
I'm sorry,
but we're not together.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.245
Tell me you missed me.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.312
I haven't missed you.

37:29.314 --> 37:31.248
[gasps]
Daddy lies.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.883
Okay, Reed is not your daddy,
and Reed is very serious.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.585
You miss my boobies,
don't you?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.420
- Look at them.
- Look.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.923
I don't know
how else to tell you--
look at me--

37:39.925 --> 37:41.958
I don't know else
to tell you this, okay.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.994
- It's not gonna happen.
- Shush.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.629
- No, no, no, no.
- Stop.

37:45.631 --> 37:48.431
No no.
Just don't fight it.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.300
- Megan...
- Just don't fight it.

37:50.302 --> 37:51.635
- Megan...
- Just don't fight it.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.036
- Don't do it.
- Don't you fight it.

37:53.038 --> 37:54.571
- Don't do it.
- Don't you fight it.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.306
Can you stop?
Stop stop no.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.674
- Stop.
- Ugh!

37:57.676 --> 37:58.875
Oh.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.443
- Okay. All right.
- Oh my God.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.612
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.848
- Okay?
- I need ice.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.516
- Okay.
- Get out of my way.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.852
- All right.
- Get out of my face.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.553
Megan...

38:16.662 --> 38:18.628
Megan, let me help you.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.963
Um...

38:19.965 --> 38:21.498
I'm... Oh...

38:21.500 --> 38:24.034
- Okay, I'm so good.
- Okay.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.771
- I am so good.
- Okay.

38:27.773 --> 38:29.439
I'll see you later, okay?

38:29.441 --> 38:30.774
Okay.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.475
Not... Bye.

38:32.477 --> 38:33.777
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see you later.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.712
Okay.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.713
Okay.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.048
- Okay, um.
- Okay.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.916
- Thank you.
- See you.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.020
- Twice in one day, huh?

38:44.022 --> 38:45.789
- Bishop, not now. Wait.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.657
What do you mean.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.026
Dude, everyone knows
you slept with Brynn.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.003
[music playing]

39:11.016 --> 39:12.882
Just let me get
just one piece.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.417
You look good.
This is the same as
in high school.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.753
No, it's not the same, man.

39:16.755 --> 39:19.556
Just move one second.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.491
What is that?
What was that?

39:39.044 --> 39:40.777
- [knocking on door]
- Yo.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.612
- Is it done?
- Uh...

39:42.614 --> 39:44.614
Yeah, I just need the girls.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.783
Perfect.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.485
Um, anything else?

39:48.487 --> 39:52.122
Yeah, what you got there?

39:52.124 --> 39:54.858
It's just molly, man.
It's not hard stuff.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.559
How many you got?

39:56.561 --> 39:58.595
Seriously?
You gonna babysit me all night?

39:58.597 --> 40:01.598
No. man, I'm not,
I'm not trying to I just,

40:01.600 --> 40:04.401
you know, I want one.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.702
For what?

40:05.704 --> 40:06.936
To take.

40:06.938 --> 40:09.739
Are you fucking with me
right now?

40:09.741 --> 40:12.742
Look. I know it seems like
I have everything together,

40:12.744 --> 40:15.412
but I don't.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.913
Look, Bishop.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.448
I just don't
think it's a good idea,
all right?

40:18.450 --> 40:20.450
It's gonna be fine.

40:20.452 --> 40:23.119
Shit, man. All right,
just take half, okay?
They're strong.

40:23.121 --> 40:25.588
Half, right?

40:25.590 --> 40:26.990
Perfect.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.931
[music playing]

40:41.773 --> 40:43.973
All right.
Hand it over.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.975
Okay.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.744
Everybody say,
"Happy 1/2 New Year."

40:47.746 --> 40:50.680
All:
Happy 1/2 New Year.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.584
Hey.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.820
How're you doing?
Are you okay?

40:56.822 --> 40:59.722
Yeah.
I'm just breathing.

40:59.724 --> 41:01.691
Well, that's good.

41:01.693 --> 41:04.527
Keep that up.

41:04.529 --> 41:06.596
Okay.
This is fucking weird.

41:08.667 --> 41:09.999
Okay.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.935
Let me see it
before you post it.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.470
I love this.
We're almost ready.

41:13.472 --> 41:15.038
We might actually
be on time this year.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.140
I like the second one.
Will you text that one to me?

41:17.142 --> 41:20.577
Holy shit.
I look fucking banging.

41:20.579 --> 41:23.112
You guys, I can't go.
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

41:29.054 --> 41:31.688
[music playing]

41:46.872 --> 41:49.906
[music playing]

41:54.679 --> 41:56.746
Reed!

41:56.748 --> 41:58.181
I'm gonna miss you.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.116
You're so cute.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.684
When's your last day?

42:01.686 --> 42:03.086
Wednesday.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.621
It's not gonna be the same
without you.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.122
- So soon!
- I know it sucks.

42:06.124 --> 42:08.124
So when are you leaving?

42:08.126 --> 42:09.826
Um...
I'm gonna get a drink.

42:09.828 --> 42:11.895
I'll see
you guys in a sec, okay?

42:13.598 --> 42:14.697
Always loved him.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.581
Okay, I think...

42:31.583 --> 42:33.583
he spotted you.

42:33.585 --> 42:36.920
So go talk to him.

42:36.922 --> 42:39.622
I just don't
want to overwhelm him
right now, you know?

42:39.624 --> 42:42.191
Now if you don't do this,

42:42.193 --> 42:44.727
then you're
just another creeper
of the party.

42:44.729 --> 42:45.795
All right.

42:47.766 --> 42:49.299
Ugh, God
Okay.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.238
Blake...

42:55.240 --> 42:58.708
Blake, Look. Shit.
Everything's so bright in here.

42:58.710 --> 43:00.043
- Did you take a half--
- Hold on a second.

43:00.045 --> 43:02.045
This music... Is it me?
Am I amusing?

43:02.047 --> 43:03.580
- No, you are not amusing.
- Help me find an orange tree.

43:03.582 --> 43:04.781
I have to make oranges.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.249
We don't need oranges right now.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.184
Does anyone want to tell me
why Josh is here?

43:08.186 --> 43:10.019
Yeah, um...

43:10.021 --> 43:11.854
Everything's gonna be great.
Okay, just love each other.

43:11.856 --> 43:14.290
We all came from
a vagina. Okay?

43:14.292 --> 43:16.025
It would've been really nice
if you would've warned me, okay?

43:16.027 --> 43:17.594
Everything's gonna be fine.

43:17.596 --> 43:20.029
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Reed, come on, man.

43:20.031 --> 43:23.032
- See what you did, Bishop.
- I didn't do shit.

43:23.034 --> 43:24.734
Can you just calm down, man?

43:24.736 --> 43:26.069
I'm calm.
All right?

43:26.071 --> 43:28.137
You stop breathing
so damn heavy.

43:28.139 --> 43:30.840
I got to go.

43:30.842 --> 43:32.909
Is this a chalkboard
or a window.

43:36.114 --> 43:37.981
Kyle, give me that cigarette.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.349
Thanks.
You got a light?

43:42.287 --> 43:43.720
Thank you.

43:53.832 --> 43:55.298
So you're a smoker now?

43:58.069 --> 43:59.135
What're you doing here?

44:01.206 --> 44:03.206
I came to see you.
I heard you were leaving.

44:03.208 --> 44:04.841
You were correct.

44:08.246 --> 44:10.146
Look.
I think you're making
a big mistake.

44:10.148 --> 44:13.082
Your opinion means nothing.

44:13.084 --> 44:16.352
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It doesn't.

44:16.354 --> 44:17.687
No, doesn't.

44:17.689 --> 44:19.022
Was this your big plan,

44:19.024 --> 44:20.356
coming to the other party
and cornering me

44:20.358 --> 44:21.724
so I couldn't make
a big scene?

44:21.726 --> 44:24.193
It's not even like that.
I just...

44:24.195 --> 44:26.896
- I just came to see you.
- Cool.

44:26.898 --> 44:29.265
Well, maybe you could've texted
first or send me an email

44:29.267 --> 44:31.067
or some sort of communication
instead of nothing

44:31.069 --> 44:32.902
- for entire year.
Look.

44:32.904 --> 44:34.904
- I know that you're upset.
- No man, being upset would mean

44:34.906 --> 44:37.040
that I actually cared.

44:44.749 --> 44:46.916
Pam, I think
you have a visitor.

44:46.918 --> 44:49.886
- Oh my god. That's amazing.
- Look how cute he is.

44:49.888 --> 44:52.989
Why can I just
have a one-night stand
like a normal person?

44:57.262 --> 44:58.895
Hi.

44:58.897 --> 45:01.064
- I bought these for you.
- Listen Marty. I know--

45:01.066 --> 45:03.066
Just take it slow.

45:03.068 --> 45:05.735
No sweetie.
There is no slow.

45:05.737 --> 45:07.170
We can try, right?

45:07.172 --> 45:08.438
It's very simple.

45:08.440 --> 45:10.740
I need a fuck buddy

45:10.742 --> 45:12.241
and you
are right up my alley.

45:12.243 --> 45:13.776
I don't care
if you're tired.

45:13.778 --> 45:15.278
When I want to sex,
I want sex

45:15.280 --> 45:17.447
and I need to get it.
So you can be at my beckon call,

45:17.449 --> 45:19.148
do as I say,

45:19.150 --> 45:21.150
and we have
a wonderful time.
Capeesh?

45:21.152 --> 45:24.253
Uh... Okay.

45:24.255 --> 45:26.122
Uh, yeah, wow.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.825
You're like fucking amazing.

45:28.827 --> 45:31.160
And if you
fall in love with me,
we're done.

45:31.162 --> 45:33.229
And seriously,
red roses?

45:33.231 --> 45:34.964
What is this, prom?

45:34.966 --> 45:36.065
Buy me something
I could use.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.067
Like a Fendi bag.

45:38.069 --> 45:40.303
Okay. Fendi bag.

45:40.305 --> 45:42.338
Okay, yeah, yeah, all right.
Yeah, I could do that.

45:42.340 --> 45:43.973
Also...

45:43.975 --> 45:46.142
I wear six inch heels.

45:46.144 --> 45:48.745
I know you
and my brother are--
we're friends,

45:48.747 --> 45:51.247
but if he so much
as hears about this,

45:51.249 --> 45:53.816
my entire shoe
goes up your ass.

45:53.818 --> 45:56.119
You're not into that,
are you?

45:57.889 --> 45:59.756
No.

45:59.758 --> 46:01.991
I mean, are you?

46:01.993 --> 46:04.827
Ewe.

46:04.829 --> 46:06.162
Mm, maybe.
Okay.

46:06.164 --> 46:07.430
I'm gonna go in now,
you wait here.

46:07.432 --> 46:09.499
We, we should not
be seen together.

46:09.501 --> 46:11.334
Uh, okay. Yeah.

46:11.336 --> 46:14.470
- I'll count to 100-- Oh.
- No offense.

46:14.472 --> 46:16.339
They're gorgeous.

46:16.341 --> 46:17.473
[whispering]
Oh my God.

46:20.078 --> 46:21.244
She's so hot.

46:21.246 --> 46:26.082
[music playing]

46:32.390 --> 46:33.956
Please excuse me.

46:33.958 --> 46:35.792
I need to go change
my panties.

46:35.794 --> 46:37.960
What?

46:37.962 --> 46:40.830
[music playing]

46:44.469 --> 46:46.936
[babbling]

46:54.879 --> 46:56.279
There you are.

46:56.281 --> 46:57.880
Oh my God.
You taste like lavender.

46:57.882 --> 46:59.882
- What's gotten into you?
- Nothing.

46:59.884 --> 47:01.350
I'm good.
You look,

47:01.352 --> 47:02.852
you look fucking hot.
You know, you look like...

47:02.854 --> 47:04.520
Oh my God.
You're rolling.

47:04.522 --> 47:05.922
- I'm not rolling. I'm standing
- Your pupils were huge.

47:05.924 --> 47:07.323
This is how I look.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.258
I mean,
my eyes are naturally
this big.

47:09.260 --> 47:11.093
Look me in the eye
and tell me you didn't
take molly.

47:11.095 --> 47:13.095
Okay, fine. Fuck it.
I took the molly.

47:13.097 --> 47:14.530
Okay, but you know what,
I love it,

47:14.532 --> 47:16.833
all right, and I love you.
That's all that matters.

47:16.835 --> 47:18.234
- Who gave it to you?
- Who do you think

47:18.236 --> 47:19.836
gave it to him?

47:19.838 --> 47:21.270
I'm gonna kill your boyfriend.

47:21.272 --> 47:22.605
Yeah,
he's not my boyfriend
anymore.

47:22.607 --> 47:24.307
- So I don't care.
- You don't touch him.

47:24.309 --> 47:26.175
He's a national treasure, okay?

47:26.177 --> 47:28.311
I'm all right.

47:28.313 --> 47:29.846
You get out of here, girl.

47:29.848 --> 47:32.148
You get.

47:32.150 --> 47:34.483
[music playing]

47:41.292 --> 47:44.460
Whoa, hey.
Hey, did you talk to Reed?

47:44.462 --> 47:46.128
Yeah, but, man,
it's not the best time.

47:46.130 --> 47:48.197
No, it's the greatest time.

47:48.199 --> 47:49.632
That's a nice shirt.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.534
Look. I'm just gonna
holler up later.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.536
- That's it.
- No, you have to stay.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.538
Okay, if you leave now, you're
gonna ruin the goddamn surprise.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.974
But he clearly
doesn't want me here.

47:57.976 --> 47:59.542
So what.
You know what?

47:59.544 --> 48:02.511
If you fucking leave here,
you got to go through me.

48:02.513 --> 48:04.046
- Come on.
- Look. I'm not gonna...

48:04.048 --> 48:05.882
Make a move at me.
Fight!

48:05.884 --> 48:08.384
- Are you...
- Shit. How many are you?

48:08.386 --> 48:10.953
How, how fucked up are you?

48:12.390 --> 48:14.123
- Listen, man.
- Are you...

48:15.894 --> 48:17.560
- What is your...
- Hey, we got to stay.

48:17.562 --> 48:19.195
We staying.

48:19.197 --> 48:22.632
Do you know whose this is?
I just picked it up.

48:22.634 --> 48:24.166
Hey, ladies.

48:24.168 --> 48:26.535
Oh, you look lovely.

48:26.537 --> 48:29.672
Oh, are you surprised?

48:29.674 --> 48:32.508
This is Whitney.
Josh's girlfriend.

48:32.510 --> 48:34.577
- Did you just say Josh?
- Where is he?

48:34.579 --> 48:40.016
Josh is fulfilling
his life's purpose tonight.

48:40.018 --> 48:42.418
- Josh is making amends.
- Amends? What are you,

48:42.420 --> 48:43.986
his life coach?

48:43.988 --> 48:45.521
Actually...

48:45.523 --> 48:47.690
- here's my card...
- Oh.

48:47.692 --> 48:51.227
I'm gonna
put my purse down
in Reed's room.

48:51.229 --> 48:52.929
So you two are fucking, right?

48:53.698 --> 48:55.064
No.

49:01.639 --> 49:03.506
-Hi.
- I didn't know you were here.

49:03.508 --> 49:05.508
I just came to drop off
my purse.

49:05.510 --> 49:07.276
No, it's um...

49:07.278 --> 49:09.645
That's okay.

49:09.647 --> 49:12.415
I saw Josh.
Are you okay?

49:12.417 --> 49:14.016
Yeah, it's cool.

49:16.454 --> 49:19.588
Reed, come on. It's me.
You can be honest.

49:19.590 --> 49:23.559
Okay, uh, honesty...

49:23.561 --> 49:26.095
Um...

49:26.097 --> 49:28.597
Are we okay?

49:28.599 --> 49:30.333
- Why wouldn't we be?
- Come on, Brynn.

49:30.335 --> 49:32.101
- Don't do that.
Do what?

49:32.103 --> 49:34.236
You tried to walk out
and act like nothing happened.

49:34.238 --> 49:36.472
You didn't remember
anything that happened.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.407
- Yeah,
but that wasn't my fault.
- Yeah, so fuck me, right,

49:38.409 --> 49:42.678
for moving on
and just making things
normal again.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.747
I've never had anything
like that happen before.

49:44.749 --> 49:47.216
Please stop.

49:47.218 --> 49:49.185
I'm trying to be honest.

49:49.187 --> 49:51.454
What does it matter anyhow,
you're leaving?

49:54.292 --> 49:56.025
You're being
a real bitch right now.

49:58.763 --> 50:00.463
Cool.

50:00.465 --> 50:02.665
Calling me a bitch
like every other guy.

50:02.667 --> 50:05.234
Act like a bitch
like every other girl.

50:05.236 --> 50:07.269
Fuck you.

50:13.444 --> 50:16.379
[music playing]

50:20.785 --> 50:22.618
What the fuck
are you doing?

50:22.620 --> 50:24.320
Nothing.

50:24.322 --> 50:26.655
- You're being an asshole.
- What does it matter?

50:26.657 --> 50:29.091
All right,
you're not my girlfriend.

50:29.093 --> 50:31.227
He's all yours.

50:54.786 --> 50:56.385
[knock on door]

50:56.387 --> 50:57.787
Someone's in here.

51:03.661 --> 51:05.694
What do you want?

51:05.696 --> 51:07.696
Have you just been getting
fucked up all day?

51:07.698 --> 51:09.698
Maybe.
Jealous?

51:09.700 --> 51:11.767
No. Not really.

51:16.674 --> 51:18.207
I have to pee.

51:18.209 --> 51:19.442
Don't mind me.

51:26.851 --> 51:29.385
Do you remember what you thought
the first time you saw me?

51:30.555 --> 51:32.855
I thought you were trouble.

51:32.857 --> 51:35.291
You liked it.

51:35.293 --> 51:37.326
I know
I could be dangerous
with you.

51:45.536 --> 51:48.504
So be dangerous with me.

51:48.506 --> 51:50.840
How?

51:50.842 --> 51:52.541
Fuck me.

51:52.543 --> 51:54.310
Right here,
I dare you.

51:54.312 --> 51:56.445
You dare me?
What is this, seventh grade?

52:03.454 --> 52:05.554
Take your pants off.

52:17.802 --> 52:19.335
[knocking on door]

52:19.337 --> 52:20.469
Leave!

52:22.206 --> 52:24.173
You know,
I just feel like

52:24.175 --> 52:27.176
I'm the only person
working at this relationship.

52:27.178 --> 52:29.678
I don't understand
why you're just being so cold.

52:29.680 --> 52:31.380
You know, like

52:31.382 --> 52:34.383
you turned your parents
against me.

52:34.385 --> 52:36.385
I've been trying so hard

52:36.387 --> 52:39.355
and you just sit here
you're not saying anything,

52:39.357 --> 52:41.524
I just really think,

52:41.526 --> 52:43.225
you know,
like you can work at it

52:43.227 --> 52:45.294
like I want to work at it.

52:45.296 --> 52:47.763
I just thought
we had something, you know,
like really special.

52:47.765 --> 52:50.299
Yo, come on.
You been in there
15 minutes.

52:50.301 --> 52:52.234
Stop doing drugs
in my bathroom.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.437
Hello!

52:55.439 --> 52:56.772
Hey, buddy.

52:56.774 --> 52:59.475
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing.

52:59.477 --> 53:01.810
Why are you being weird?
What are you hiding?

53:01.812 --> 53:04.380
I got something
to talk to you about.

53:04.382 --> 53:05.948
What's up?

53:05.950 --> 53:09.451
You're like
the world's worst liar,
by the way.

53:09.453 --> 53:11.787
- Oh hi.
- Hi.

53:11.789 --> 53:14.323
Hi. You guys
getting the band
back together?

53:14.325 --> 53:16.325
- Together: No. No.
- Okay. Just a question.

53:16.327 --> 53:18.194
- I'm gonna go back
to the party.
- Okay.

53:19.564 --> 53:21.497
What's up with that?

53:21.499 --> 53:23.365
I think we both
just needed to make sure.

53:23.367 --> 53:25.534
- Make sure of what?
- Nothing.

53:25.536 --> 53:26.869
It's different.

53:26.871 --> 53:28.971
- It's not the same.
- Okay.

53:28.973 --> 53:30.839
Hey, man.
How long is this hallway?

53:30.841 --> 53:33.442
Look. We only have
an hour and a half.
All right?

53:33.444 --> 53:35.411
Oh my God. Do you think
we'll have enough time?

53:35.413 --> 53:36.745
Oh, you stop that shit out.

53:36.747 --> 53:38.280
Okay, you two
need to hash it out.

53:38.282 --> 53:40.282
You need to stop being
a baby penis.

53:40.284 --> 53:42.585
- Be a grown penis, okay?
- Okay.

53:42.587 --> 53:44.653
You two have snuck this shit
behind my back all day,

53:44.655 --> 53:46.622
- and it's fucked up.
- This is clearly
not the time for him.

53:46.624 --> 53:48.591
No, it's perfect timing.

53:48.593 --> 53:50.693
Okay, you got
five seconds to knock it off.
Look. I don't...

53:50.695 --> 53:52.861
You two,
you need to go in
the bathroom,

53:52.863 --> 53:54.496
seven seconds in heaven,
you don't need to make out,

53:54.498 --> 53:56.565
but you
just need to fucking
make up, okay?

53:56.567 --> 53:58.634
- You guys suck.
- Yeah, get in there.

54:01.772 --> 54:02.771
There we go.

54:02.773 --> 54:04.306
Dude, you're like MacGyver.

54:04.308 --> 54:05.641
I know.

54:05.643 --> 54:07.009
You know how long it took me
to do that?

54:07.011 --> 54:08.877
- You're smart.
- I am.

54:08.879 --> 54:10.713
- You are.
- I'm a genius.

54:10.715 --> 54:12.715
Come on.

54:12.717 --> 54:14.817
Reed:
Not funny.

54:22.393 --> 54:23.726
You better sip on that.

54:23.728 --> 54:25.728
You're gonna be a hot mess
if you don't.

54:25.730 --> 54:28.430
Cup.

54:28.432 --> 54:30.933
Drink to your reality.

54:30.935 --> 54:34.303
I think
you actually told me that.

54:34.305 --> 54:36.772
Yeah, that actually
does sound like something
I would say.

54:38.309 --> 54:39.942
Bishop told me
you haven't done it yet.

54:39.944 --> 54:42.311
Yeah.
It just didn't feel right.

54:43.648 --> 54:46.348
This could be your only shot.

54:46.350 --> 54:48.350
It's not like I'm never gonna
talk to him again so.

54:48.352 --> 54:51.887
Brynn, he loves you.

54:54.292 --> 54:55.424
I know.

54:57.795 --> 55:00.329
Well, then don't do something
you're gonna regret.

55:00.331 --> 55:01.997
Yeah, okay.

55:01.999 --> 55:03.532
Okay.

55:03.534 --> 55:04.867
- Okay.
- All right.

55:04.869 --> 55:06.735
Well, let's do this shit.

55:06.737 --> 55:08.304
Okay.

55:13.544 --> 55:16.045
Let's go!

55:16.047 --> 55:17.579
Let's go!

55:17.581 --> 55:19.882
I killed y'all.
On the first try!

55:26.023 --> 55:27.556
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:27.558 --> 55:30.726
- I love you.
- I love you.

55:30.728 --> 55:32.728
- Where's my ring?
- What?

55:32.730 --> 55:33.996
My ring.
Where is it?

55:33.998 --> 55:36.765
Oh, uh,
I keep it...

55:36.767 --> 55:38.367
I keep it close to my heart.

55:40.571 --> 55:42.905
Sell it.

55:42.907 --> 55:44.840
I don't want to sell it.

55:44.842 --> 55:49.611
No, I mean,
we don't need a pieces
of symbolical shit.

55:49.613 --> 55:51.113
Sell it for Reed.

55:51.115 --> 55:53.649
He's our family.

55:53.651 --> 55:57.419
Yeah, but I mean,
what does that mean for us?

55:57.421 --> 55:59.755
Bishop.

55:59.757 --> 56:00.923
Bishop...

56:00.925 --> 56:02.791
Yes.

56:02.793 --> 56:05.494
Bishop Miller...

56:05.496 --> 56:07.363
- Bishop...
- What are you doing?

56:07.365 --> 56:09.765
...Miller, wonderful man,

56:09.767 --> 56:12.634
will you marry me?

56:12.636 --> 56:14.937
Yes. I will marry you.

56:19.610 --> 56:21.477
I said yes!

56:21.479 --> 56:22.878
I said yes!

56:28.753 --> 56:31.086
I'm sorry
for what happened.

56:31.088 --> 56:34.089
If I could take that back,
I would.

56:34.091 --> 56:36.625
Well, you can't.

56:36.627 --> 56:38.494
I know that.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.829
And as much as you're gonna
hate me for saying it,

56:40.831 --> 56:43.165
I'm so glad that it happened.

56:43.167 --> 56:44.833
I needed that wake-up call.

56:44.835 --> 56:47.669
That's nice.

56:47.671 --> 56:50.839
Dude, this time last year,
I had no idea who I was.

56:50.841 --> 56:52.941
I lost my job,

56:52.943 --> 56:55.477
Lindsay, the band.

56:56.714 --> 56:59.047
I'm kind of where
you are right now.

56:59.049 --> 57:01.049
So maybe I should
try and find myself

57:01.051 --> 57:02.785
and be more like you.

57:04.054 --> 57:05.788
Yeah, something like that.

57:05.790 --> 57:08.490
It's a whole year.

57:08.492 --> 57:09.992
Now...

57:09.994 --> 57:12.528
here you are.

57:12.530 --> 57:15.130
Where you been, man?

57:15.132 --> 57:17.499
Different places.

57:17.501 --> 57:18.667
Rehab.

57:18.669 --> 57:20.903
For what?

57:20.905 --> 57:23.605
Anxiety,

57:23.607 --> 57:25.207
depression, stress.

57:25.209 --> 57:27.943
I didn't think
you'd go to rehab for that.

57:35.019 --> 57:36.785
I tried to kill myself.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.754
Twice before that night.

57:40.157 --> 57:41.590
But I couldn't
go through with it.

57:43.527 --> 57:45.461
When?

57:47.198 --> 57:49.598
Look.
It doesn't matter.
It's over now.

58:04.114 --> 58:06.648
I could've helped you.

58:06.650 --> 58:09.952
I could've done something.

58:09.954 --> 58:11.954
There's just
some things that

58:11.956 --> 58:13.789
you have to face
on your own.

58:13.791 --> 58:15.023
You know?

58:19.096 --> 58:22.664
There were so many times
when I just wanted,

58:22.666 --> 58:24.166
you know,
to talk to you

58:24.168 --> 58:26.168
or get your advice

58:26.170 --> 58:29.071
and I couldn't do that.

58:36.780 --> 58:40.115
So what,
you're just gonna
give up now?

58:40.117 --> 58:42.651
That's not fair, man.
You don't know what's
been going on.

58:42.653 --> 58:46.855
Oh, I got the Bishop's
cliff notes version.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.590
- Okay.
- So.

58:48.592 --> 58:50.592
I know everything.

58:50.594 --> 58:52.561
Way too many details.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.897
Oh God.

58:54.899 --> 58:56.265
That motherfucker.

58:56.267 --> 58:57.766
Dude.

58:59.837 --> 59:03.772
You can't leave here
with any regrets, man.

59:03.774 --> 59:06.708
You can't be afraid
to ask for help

59:06.710 --> 59:09.111
and you can't be
too stubborn to take it.

59:13.684 --> 59:15.684
So you're a shrink now?

59:15.686 --> 59:17.252
I've had lots of experience.

59:21.559 --> 59:23.125
I really missed you, man.

59:24.995 --> 59:27.596
Yeah, I missed you, too.

59:32.703 --> 59:34.803
So it is like,

59:34.805 --> 59:36.805
is it weird...

59:36.807 --> 59:39.107
to like hug?

59:39.109 --> 59:41.109
Yeah, it's fucking weird.

59:41.111 --> 59:42.644
I was thinking that.

59:42.646 --> 59:43.979
We'll just take
one step at a time.

59:43.981 --> 59:45.314
Can I see your phone though?

59:45.316 --> 59:46.915
Uh, yeah.

59:55.159 --> 59:56.692
Straight to voicemail.

59:56.694 --> 59:59.027
So my sister
doesn't give a shit.

59:59.029 --> 01:00:00.629
Uh...

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:05.734
Okay, well,
we could always
try screaming.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:08.604
Yeah, we can Jedi mind trick
the door open.

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:09.938
Oh, okay.
That's gonna work.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.107
- That might work.
- No, we should scream

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:14.109
- with like a...
- I don't feel like I should...

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.044
Tell me what to scream.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:18.880
You could do--
you could go like--
just go like, low,

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:20.215
like a base,
and I'll be like...

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:21.750
- Uh...
- Hah...

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:23.251
- That's not screaming...
- You guys.

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:25.354
I just heard
that whole fucking thing.

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:27.956
It was super cute
and your guy's relationship
is really weird,

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.192
but I figured
I can let you guys out now.

01:00:30.194 --> 01:00:31.727
Also, I just
had sex in the bathroom.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:32.928
So there's a little bit
of me on you.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:34.262
You're disgusting.

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:35.631
I love you.

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.132
- You're a gem.
- Oh by the way,

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:40.135
that girl
Whitney is insane,
so be careful.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.136
Thank you.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.371
Where'd you find her?

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:45.774
Um, I'm gonna get a drink.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:47.109
Can you have one?

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:48.977
Yes, I can have a drink.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.979
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:53.849
Where's that little Italian
sausage I love so much?

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.350
Megan, how's your face?

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:56.885
Oh, it's okay,
but you know

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:59.054
you could help me get better.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.889
How?

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:03.392
You could put your penis

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:06.328
into my vagina...

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:09.164
- a lot
- Okay, I can't do this.

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.667
Fine. You miss
my little boobies?

01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:14.036
Big boobies...
They're very...

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:16.204
Megan, you don't want a guy
like me, okay?

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:18.907
I'm boring,
and I'm in love with
somebody else.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:22.077
Oh, you mean Brynn.

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.854
Like everyone knows
that you're in love with Brynn.

01:01:23.855 --> 01:01:25.630
- It's so not a big deal.
- No one knows that.

01:01:25.631 --> 01:01:27.406
- That's bullshit.
- But listen.

01:01:27.407 --> 01:01:29.182
We're cool.
I was just trying to fuck.

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.854
- Uh, what?
- Yeah,like I thought

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.322
this was a sure thing,
but lately,

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:37.426
you've been like
a major drag so.

01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:39.294
Um, no hard feelings,

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.997
like let's just, you know,

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:43.965
and if you could just point me
in the direction of like

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:45.701
I don't know,

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:48.370
literally anything else
with a pulse that's like down.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:49.971
You know what I mean?

01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:54.242
Mm-hmm.

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:55.844
- Oh, fuck yeah.
- You're a doll.

01:01:55.846 --> 01:01:57.913
I like it.

01:01:57.915 --> 01:01:59.247
Enjoy it.

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.285
You got to write that down.
That's a movie.

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:05.087
Am I living in the fucking
Twilight Zone?

01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:07.422
Dude, you do not
wanna get into it with me about

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:09.958
- alternate universes and shit.
- No, I really don't actually.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.727
- Reed, get in here.
- What?

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:12.794
Reed.

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:16.865
No.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:19.868
[music playing]

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.737
[music stops]

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:27.943
Hey, you guys,
uh, real quick.

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:29.444
This is a special night,
you know,

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:33.081
it's our 1/2 New Year's
celebration party, right?

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.317
- [cheering]
- Right? Right? You love this.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:36.852
Hell yeah! Sorry.

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:40.288
Um, but it's also
a special night because

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:43.425
we say goodbye
to our beloved Reed.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.026
Reed, you've, you know,

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:46.194
you've influenced

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.164
all of us in many ways.

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:51.299
We love you, buddy.

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:55.437
I think I can speak
for all of us when I say,
we don't want you to go.

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:58.106
But, you know,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:01.109
But that doesn't mean
we can't send you off
with a gift.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.345
Blake.
There you go.

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:08.116
Reed, thank you for always
being the one to take charge

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:09.484
and keep us in line

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:11.887
and for never
being afraid of yourself.

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:13.121
We love you.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:19.294
My baby brother,
I know you feel you need
to move home

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.163
and I told you 100 times

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:23.899
you could stay with me
till you get back on your feet,

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:26.101
but you're stubborn
like mommy.

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:28.370
So I support what you choose.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:32.340
And even though
you're a fucking pain in the ass
to be around...

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:37.112
I'm gonna miss you,
Reed Deluca.

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:40.382
But, I know
when the time is right,

01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:42.384
you'll be back.

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:44.252
Okay, turn it off.

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:46.955
Blake, turn it off.

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.223
Reed,

01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:50.225
hey buddy, um,

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:51.860
it's never a party without you.

01:03:51.862 --> 01:03:54.196
So our parties
are obviously gonna suck.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:57.365
And, um,
all seriousness,

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:59.968
uh, you always have
a home here,

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.904
and I'm gonna miss you, bud.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:08.977
We're all a family.
You know, we're a weird
tight-knit group

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:11.980
of fucked up people
who found each other
in this town.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:14.316
But, I always
felt like Reed

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.318
was the glue,
you know?

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.486
He never let us get caught up
in our own bullshit.

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:21.590
He always helped us see things
from the other side.

01:04:21.592 --> 01:04:23.959
Yo, Reed.

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:25.026
Um...

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:30.866
Shit, I don't,
I don't know what to say.

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:32.367
My hope for you
is that you,

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:35.270
never lose this belief
of yourself and,

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:38.139
and others.

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:40.141
I'm gonna
miss you a lot, man.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:42.077
It's not gonna be the same
without you.

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:47.482
Fuck off.

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.217
Uh, Reed, man...

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.653
you were one
of the first people
that I met

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:53.655
whenever I came out here.

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:57.158
Um, you've been cool as hell...

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.493
the entire time,

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:01.363
probably too cool,
uh, most of the time.

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:03.365
And,

01:05:03.367 --> 01:05:05.533
I don't want you to go.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:08.003
Uh, you've always known
what you wanted.

01:05:08.005 --> 01:05:09.504
You were gonna fight for it.

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:11.339
You were never gonna
let anything get in your way.

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:13.174
I think
that's what everybody...

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:15.043
that's what I admire
most about you.

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:17.545
And, yeah,
I love you, dude.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.552
Brynn:
This is all so surreal.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.388
Who would've thought
that we would be living

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:29.024
hundreds of miles away
from each other.

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:34.262
It's crazy that
that's gonna be a reality.
I don't want it to be.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.097
I'm scared of that.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.034
I don't want you to leave.

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:44.339
I don't want
to know my best friend
through skype

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:47.609
or a random text,
and I don't want to be at home
on a Friday night

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.045
and think,
"If Reed were here...

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.681
what would we be doing?"

01:05:56.153 --> 01:05:57.552
I love you.

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:04.626
I love you so much.
And, um...

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:08.229
and I just
want you to know that
I'll love you forever.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.648
Can I,
can I steal you
for a sec?

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.650
Yeah, what's up?

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.352
Hold on.
Don't Leave.
One second.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:31.686
- Okay.
- There is.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.088
Oh.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.490
You make me
the happiest man.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.460
Um, it's not
really my style.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.761
- And I, I love you...
- No.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:41.062
- Why no?
- Sell it.

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:42.397
No.

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:43.732
No, no, no, no.
That's not even an option.

01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:45.166
I'm not gonna
take that from you.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.668
It's the only option.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.503
Okay?

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.117
- No, we can't.
- Why?

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:04.119
Because you're just
gonna leave me anyhow.

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:05.520
So give me a reason to stay.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:17.165
I was waiting
for the right opportunity

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.267
- to come talk to you.
- What'd I say, Marty?

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:23.171
Well, considering
fuck buddy status...

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:24.672
how about
we sneak out of here?

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:26.207
Where're you thinking?

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.209
Laundry room,
spin cycle.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:30.078
You wearing
boxers or briefs.?

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.048
Boxer-briefs.
Best of both worlds.

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:36.284
Okay,
but we can't look
suspicious.

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:37.619
I'll go set up.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.154
You're very strange,
aren't you?

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:41.222
You never had a problem
with that before.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:46.428
Oh shit. Um, hey guys.
Look, look, look.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.130
Um, we might be late
on this countdown, but fuck it.
We're gonna get right to it.

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:52.067
Ten, nine,
eight, seven,

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:55.203
six, five,
four, three,

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.704
two, one...

01:07:56.706 --> 01:07:58.273
Happy 1/2 New Year!

01:07:58.275 --> 01:07:59.641
Fuck yeah!

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:06.748
Reed:
All right. I guess he was
a little excited.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:11.219
I'm so proud of you.

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:14.722
Thank you.
I...

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:18.158
Like, I'm fucked up.

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:20.662
I know one day
I'm gonna be good,

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:23.198
and I'm cool with that.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.700
I...

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:27.569
I don't know
what else to say.
Thank you.

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:29.571
It's okay.

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:31.573
You don't have to say
anything else.

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:33.108
Um...

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.742
- I get it.
- Okay. Good.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.511
You have to work on
opening up your chakras.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:41.216
Yeah, it's um...

01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:44.452
It's a chakra thing is...

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.354
is what it is,
unfortunately.

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.457
- Okay, come on.
- Hold on.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.326
- What?
- My sheets are in the dryer.

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:52.660
It's okay. You're gonna
have to wash them anyhow.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:55.430
- No. Let me just get them.
- Okay.

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:56.764
Cycle. Spin cycle.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:59.734
Oh! Oh! Yeah. Ooh! Ooh!

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:02.270
Yeah! Yeah!
[moaning]

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:04.139
Yeah, baby! Yeah! Yeah!

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.474
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
You guys know what time it is?

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.743
It's resolution time.
Get out on the patio.

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:10.345
[pounding on door]

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.850
Okay.

01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:18.353
- There you.
- Yep.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.854
- Ooh.
- It's about time.

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.622
- Well...
- Welcome to the party.

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.457
Look who decided to join us.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.161
We're all basically
here so.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.363
Okay, let's pile in here guys.

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:30.598
Let's do it.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.698
Yo. We're gonna pop this
on three. Ready?

01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:32.700
Yeah.

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:34.469
One, two, three...

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.906
[cheering]

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:42.343
All right, guys.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.645
Okay, so to us.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.447
To us.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.715
All:
Cheers.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.218
Eyes. Eyes. Eyes.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.653
Eyeballs.
Eyeballs.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:54.522
Eyes.
This is to eyes.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.324
It's been a great night.
Right?

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:57.825
You know,
I have a fiancÃ©.

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:01.196
She fucked up.
She don't know.

01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:03.932
And my friends friends
are friends again.

01:10:03.934 --> 01:10:04.899
Right?

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:06.901
Reed, are you staying?

01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:08.736
Well, I mean,
that ring is worth
a lot, right?

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:10.605
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:10:10.607 --> 01:10:12.774
Well, I guess
I got a call mom?

01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:15.310
Um, I promise
to pay you back though.

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:17.312
- You fucking better.
- I will.

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:18.713
All right.
So resolutions, right?

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.381
We all know
if we don't say 'em out loud

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.784
they don't come true.

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:25.587
Well, not to be a bridezilla.

01:10:25.589 --> 01:10:27.722
She won't be.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:29.791
Josh.

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:32.327
Um, just to work on me.

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:33.661
Yeah.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:34.996
Yeah, me too.

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:37.665
I'm gonna work on me.

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:39.534
Yeah.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:41.236
Oh, my turn.

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:42.804
Um, yeah.

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.439
Maybe to, um,
find a new girlfriend
this year.

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:45.740
I think
that's what I'm gonna do.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:46.841
Dick.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.613
All right, Marty.
What you got?

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:53.381
Uh...

01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:55.016
To explore the unknown.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:56.284
Ewe.

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:00.788
Yo.
On that note.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.257
I'll say,

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:03.424
I'm gonna take it easy
and, you know,

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.460
- let things come to me.
- I swear.

01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:08.596
I'm gonna stop eating hoagies.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:10.665
Nah, that's not gonna happen.

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:11.933
Yeah, fuck it.

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.971
- All right, Brynn.
- Um, To be in the present

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:19.507
and be in the now
and not worry about the future.

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:20.742
I second that.

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:23.511
Oh, okay.

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:25.480
To a year of

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:28.283
excitement, adventure
and the unknown.

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.984
- Cheers again.
- All: Cheers.

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:32.453
All:
Eyes. Eyes. Eyes...

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:37.625
- Shots.
- Yeah.

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:40.495
- Can I be your maid of honor?
- Oh my God, of course.

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:42.497
You know,
I know what they're doing.

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.532
I saw what you were doing.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:47.368
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.640
Oh. I like your boobs so much

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:55.777
You have the sexiest boobs
I've ever...

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:57.679
Come back.

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:07.955
Hey Reed Worlders.
Thank you so much for tuning in.

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:10.625
Um, we just heard the house
is being demolished today.

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:13.494
So we wanted to come
check it out and say bye so.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:15.830
Come, come here.
Come in. Don't be shy.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.366
Please?
Thank you.

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:19.867
So wanted to say
bye to the house.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:22.870
Thank you for bringing us
all together in LA.

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:24.072
We love you.

01:12:24.074 --> 01:12:25.606
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:26.941
- Say bye to the house.
- Bye house.

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.376
- Blow the house a kiss.
- I don't wanna do that.

01:12:28.378 --> 01:12:30.878
Please.
Just blow the...
Please?

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.814
