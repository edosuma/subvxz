It's a black Nisan Maxima.

Alberta license plate, YR1 9142.

It's alen vehicle,

[dramatic music intensifies]

01:43.364 --> 01:46.367

Searching the vehicle now.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.158
Code 9. Code 9.

01:55.289 --> 01:58.335
I found some metal disks
hidden in the trunk.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.555
We're gonna need a special unit.

of Border Control here.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.443
- [Voiceover] Yes,
Michael, what is it?

02:19.487 --> 02:20.401
- [Voiceover] About 20
minutes ago a man was taken

02:21.706 --> 02:23.969
into custody in Montana
not far from the border.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.841
He was trying to smuggle
in around 10-pounds

02:25.971 --> 02:28.278
of weapons-grade uranium.

03:49.403 --> 03:52.319
- Tough son of a
bitch, ain't he?

03:52.449 --> 03:54.146
- By now he should be
on his knees begging us

03:54.277 --> 03:55.844
to let him confess.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.332
- Push harder.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.212
- [Long-haired man]
This should do it.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.910
- [Commander] What is it? KH-5?

04:19.041 --> 04:20.651
- The enhanced version.

04:20.781 --> 04:23.306
It attacks the nerve cells
even faster and the pain

04:23.437 --> 04:25.308
is ten-times worse.

04:25.439 --> 04:28.268
No one's lasted more
than a couple minutes.

04:28.398 --> 04:31.227

05:33.724 --> 05:36.161
What the hell?

05:36.205 --> 05:38.338
- Maybe we should up the dosage.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.774
- No.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.167
Max, get the hell out of there.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.740
Let's get blood work done,
let's run every test possible.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.570
I k we're dealing
with a far bigger problem

05:53.701 --> 05:56.007
than a few pounds of uranium.

06:00.447 --> 06:04.973
[rapid footsteps]
[dark atmospheric music]

Synthetic genes?

06:24.166 --> 06:25.646
Nano devices?

06:25.776 --> 06:28.388
- All that's missing
is a battery pack.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.521
Is this guy even human?

06:45.622 --> 06:48.190
Is he, asking...

06:49.800 --> 06:51.411
- Pen and paper.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.325

07:32.582 --> 07:34.715
Yeah, supernovae, comets.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.412
Something like that.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.633
I had a thing about
astronomy in high school.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.376
I have no idea what these are.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.469
- I think they're dates.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.471
- Dates.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.081
- Yeah.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.520
We live in the year
1433 according to
e Islamic calendar.

08:00.697 --> 08:04.092
Looks like our prisoner can
predict celestial events.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.311
It's 140-years into the future.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.617
- Bullshit.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.676
- The first day on
the list is tomorrow.

08:24.808 --> 08:28.769
[roaring thunder]
[moody atmospheric music]

08:36.951 --> 08:38.518
Oh, look at that!

08:38.561 --> 08:40.520
I'll be damned.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.740
- [Commander] The star blew
up exactly where he said.

08:46.351 --> 08:47.788
What do you think, Fischer?

08:47.918 --> 08:49.920
Who the fuck is this guy?

08:49.964 --> 08:52.532
[ominous music]

08:52.662 --> 08:54.446
- [Fischer] As
insane as it sounds,

08:54.577 --> 08:56.448
I think he's from the future.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.451
There is no other
explanation for it.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.715
- [Commander] A
time-travelling terrorist.

09:01.845 --> 09:04.369
That doesn't sound scary at all.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.002

[children giggling]

09:36.619 --> 09:40.405

10:00.208 --> 10:02.079

10:02.210 --> 10:03.733
[Carmen sighs]

10:03.864 --> 10:05.692
[typing]

10:05.822 --> 10:06.780
[bleeps]

10:06.910 --> 10:09.521
Well it's nice
and quiet up here.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.614
Almost makes one
believe that all is

10:14.744 --> 10:17.181
peachy in the world out there.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.317
If you need me I'll be outside.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.625
[door opening and closing]

10:27.714 --> 10:30.020
- Oh, Fischer.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.240
Why am I not surprised?

10:32.370 --> 10:34.808
- Forgive the intrusion, Carmen,

10:34.851 --> 10:37.680
but you left me no choice.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.248
In the envelope is the
directive terminating

10:40.291 --> 10:43.251
your leave of absence,
effective immediately.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.687
- Since when did
you become my boss?

10:44.818 --> 10:46.689
[Fischer chuckles]

10:46.820 --> 10:48.996
- It's signed by the President.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.564
- Well you can tell the
President that I've decided

10:52.695 --> 10:54.697
not to return to my job.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.134
- Well you can tell
him that yourself.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.833
But first I need
you to hear me out.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.791
The data disk contains
a brief on a prisoner

11:01.922 --> 11:03.837
I've been working
with for years.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.840
An extraordinarily-dangerous
individual who holds the fate

11:06.970 --> 11:08.711
of our world in his hands.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.107
- So that was your
top-secret assignment?

11:13.237 --> 11:16.023
- Look, I kept you out
of it for your own good.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.677
Yeah.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.896
Now I'm desperate.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.506
I need help.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.727
- You've got the entire
agency at your disposal.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.730
- [Fischer] I need
someone I trust.

11:27.861 --> 11:28.731
[small gasp]

11:30.777 --> 11:33.170
- Are you okay?
[ominous string music]

11:34.476 --> 11:36.086
- Whoa.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.609
[chuckles]

11:37.740 --> 11:39.046
Um...

11:41.135 --> 11:43.703
Things have gotten
strange, Carmen.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.096
And I feel like I'm
losing my mind but,

11:46.227 --> 11:48.620
I'm this close to
figuring it all out.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.187
- Fischer, don't you get it?

11:50.318 --> 11:52.668
I'm in no position to help you.

11:52.799 --> 11:56.541
- I know you're still looking
for answers for what happened.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.718
Trust me, I know how it feels

11:58.848 --> 12:01.895
to be haunted by the
what-ifs and if-onlys.

12:01.938 --> 12:05.725
To be tormented by
1,000 imaginary pasts.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.770
What if I told you
your imagination

12:07.901 --> 12:09.772
can be made real, Carmen?

12:09.903 --> 12:12.775
Look, if there's one thing
I've learned from this prisoner

12:12.819 --> 12:15.386
that I know to be
true is that time,

12:15.517 --> 12:17.824
time is not what
it seems, Carmen.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.304
Time is nothing.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.090
Please, help me.

12:32.534 --> 12:36.712
[sorrowful orchestral music]

13:26.109 --> 13:28.895
- That's the marine barracks.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.679
For a Special Ops Battalion.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.289
122 men.

13:32.420 --> 13:35.423
Luckily we haven't had
much use for them so far.

13:35.466 --> 13:38.208
I'm field station
captain Paul Williams.

13:38.252 --> 13:39.035
- Agent Reese.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.211
- Welcome to the Sandbox.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.271
Here's your keycard.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.839
Your com access has
been set up as well.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.231
- [Carmen] Air lock?

14:01.275 --> 14:03.712
- Sandbox is a
nuke-proof facility.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.845
You can't be too
careful these days.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.022

14:16.507 --> 14:17.769
Fischer's been paged.

He'll meet you on
the other side.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.686

15:34.846 --> 15:36.631
- Can I help you, ma'am?

15:38.676 --> 15:41.549
- Uh yeah, I'm looking
for Agent Fischer.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.393
- [Carmen] Friendly guys.
- [Escort] Sorry.

15:59.523 --> 16:02.135
We don't get many
women down here.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.398
You know Agent Fischer well?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.575
- Yeah, he was my mentor when
I joined the agency years ago.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.142
Likes to think he still is.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.057
- It's this one.
[door knock]

16:11.187 --> 16:12.797
Agent Fischer,
PFC Sullivan here.

16:12.841 --> 16:16.018
I have a visitor for you, sir.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.673
Yeah, he's a cool guy.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.197
He shares smokes with
us, tells us jokes.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.807
[door knock]

16:22.851 --> 16:25.201
- Fischer can be a funny
guy when he wants to.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.030
- I'll call him.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.553
- Yeah.

Fischer!

16:44.786 --> 16:46.875
[phone ringing]

16:47.006 --> 16:48.790
Williams, I'm
looking for Fischer.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.618
Do you know where he is?

16:50.748 --> 16:52.228
Fischer?

16:52.359 --> 16:54.056
- [Paul] Hold on.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.016
The last time he
used his keycard

16:57.146 --> 16:59.018
was to enter his apartment.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.022
But that was two days ago.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.023
- Fischer?

[loud rumbling]

17:28.699 --> 17:30.397
[camera snapping]

17:34.270 --> 17:36.838
- Agent Carmen Reese.

17:38.666 --> 17:39.928
- Commander Jefferson.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.103
- That's right.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.975
I'm the one supposedly
in charge here.

17:44.106 --> 17:47.022
Why didn't Fischer tell
me you were coming?

17:47.153 --> 17:48.502
- Oh, I don't know, sir.

17:48.632 --> 17:51.200
I'm sure if he didn't tell
you he had his reasons.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.507
- Well he's been
avoiding me all week.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.987
Now he goes and kills himself.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.077
- You know,

17:58.207 --> 18:00.775
Fischer was troubled
when he called but he,

18:00.905 --> 18:02.646
was not suicidal.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.128
- What exactly
did he say to you?

Tonight, no end in sight.

18:21.404 --> 18:24.103

In the grip of violence,
President Turner imposes

18:40.031 --> 18:42.991
a powerful explosion rips
through an industrial complex

18:43.122 --> 18:46.168
in Mumbai killing
over 50 workers.

18:46.212 --> 18:49.345
Indian authorities are
investigating the cause.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.739
The blast occurred shortly
after the workers returned

18:51.869 --> 18:54.176
from lunch and several eye
witnesses report to seeing--

you're from there.

If that's true,

20:17.912 --> 20:20.306
if you're really
a time-traveler,

20:20.436 --> 20:23.570
then it stands to reason
that you did not come alone.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.615
That others made the
journey with you.

20:25.659 --> 20:26.660
[ominous atmospheric music]

Where people just leap

20:41.065 --> 20:44.591
Tools and weapons that we

You've been trapped in a closet,

20:52.686 --> 20:56.255
the same closet

20:56.385 --> 20:59.475
And maybe, just maybe
you're starting to realize

20:59.606 --> 21:02.609
that your buddies, your
buddies from the future,

they have absolutely no

21:23.369 --> 21:25.371
Is that how far you jumped?

21:29.026 --> 21:32.856
[prisoner speaks

21:34.641 --> 21:37.774
- [Jefferson] We came
with our leader, Abraham.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.080
- Abraham?

21:41.038 --> 21:44.128
- The father of three
great religions.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.653
Which is why he took
that name for himself.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.396
- [Fischer] How many other
friends came with you?

21:51.919 --> 21:53.486
- They are not my friends.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.227
- Then why join them?

21:58.012 --> 21:59.709
- I believe in their cause.

You wanna change the past.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.153
Is that it?

22:09.284 --> 22:11.504

You're being helpful, sir.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.347
I'm Fischer.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.967
I'm pleased to know it, Ramiro.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.404

in that cell, Fischer.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.275

22:44.406 --> 22:46.974

Minimal requirements that
will earn you my cooperation.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.154

vague beginnings of a story

22:53.284 --> 22:55.504

gonna earn you much.

Do you want to defeat
Abraham and his men?

23:00.509 --> 23:02.772

24:42.698 --> 24:46.528
The next time, I
won't come back.

24:55.450 --> 24:58.497

from Lincoln, Nebraska?

24:58.627 --> 24:59.498

25:00.716 --> 25:02.849
Nothing has happened
there as far as we know.

years since I saw my family?

25:08.028 --> 25:08.985
It's hard.

25:09.943 --> 25:11.118

news down here,

25:11.161 --> 25:12.162
even when Indian
Point point happened,

25:13.337 --> 25:14.382
they didn't tell us
for a whole week.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.125
- What did they tell you?

25:18.255 --> 25:21.171
- That a dirty bomb went
off at the nuclear reactor.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.130
- No.

25:23.260 --> 25:26.002
It was not a dirty bomb,
it was a Soviet warhead

25:26.133 --> 25:29.615
that was supposedly
decommissioned 12-years ago.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.139

coming if that's what

25:41.757 --> 25:43.542
you're asking, ma'am.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.022
- I don't think that anyone did.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.634
But still you were the last
person to see him alive.

25:48.764 --> 25:49.548
- I was?

25:49.678 --> 25:51.158
- Yeah.

25:51.201 --> 25:54.553
So, what was his mood that
day when you spoke to him?

25:56.467 --> 25:57.556
- Actually, I didn't.

25:57.599 --> 26:00.341
Fischer didn't even say hi.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.996
He went straight in, same
thing when he came out.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.040
- [Carmen] How long
was he in there for?

26:04.171 --> 26:06.565
- Barely five minutes.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.262
- Fischer unplugged the cameras.

26:08.392 --> 26:11.700
So we have no idea
what happened in there.

26:15.051 --> 26:18.533
So he goes into his apartment,
he's alone for two days

26:18.664 --> 26:21.754
and nobody hears from
him or talks to him.

26:22.972 --> 26:25.627

I heard him.

I mean, I heard his voice
last night as I walked

26:29.370 --> 26:31.633

him talking on the phone.

what he was saying?

it sounded like he was

26:34.505 --> 26:36.595

He was my best friend in a way.

You must have made quite the

The fact that they handed you
this most crucial assignment.

now that you are going
to be my new best friend,

31:04.471 --> 31:06.342
I'd like to know a little
bit more about you.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.257
- What would you like to know?

31:08.388 --> 31:09.998
- Like,

31:10.129 --> 31:13.567
what have you been up to
since all of this began?

31:13.697 --> 31:15.699
- I served in Iraq for a while.

- Ah, searching for those
elusive WMDs, I suppose.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.792
- In the beginning, yeah.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.143
Then the insurgency began and

31:24.273 --> 31:27.276
my assignment changed.

31:27.407 --> 31:30.976
Suddenly I was given hundreds
of shackled prisoners

31:31.106 --> 31:33.979
and this checklist that
made no sense to me.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.110
At the time.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.504
- A checklist?

31:37.547 --> 31:39.375
- We were told that
our suspects would be

31:39.506 --> 31:41.987
in their 20's to 30's.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.858
They wouldn't be Iraqi.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.687
Probably not even Middle-Eastern
but that they would

31:46.730 --> 31:48.297
have strange accents.

31:50.169 --> 31:52.911
Maybe they wouldn't
have an accent at all.

31:54.608 --> 31:56.175
I tortured them.

31:58.046 --> 32:00.614

that these foreigners

would display an extraordinary
tolerance to pain,

32:04.052 --> 32:06.402
even in the worst
interrogations.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.361
- Tailored genes
and nano devices

32:08.491 --> 32:10.406
are quite common in my world.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.539
- Especially among the
impoverished, I understand.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.281
To help them deal with
their miserable lives.

32:16.847 --> 32:19.372
- I trust you took
blood samples.

32:19.502 --> 32:20.939
- Thousands.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.942
They were sent back home,
tested for key genes.

32:24.072 --> 32:27.075
- Genes that could be
easily hidden or removed.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.599
- Easily.

32:32.341 --> 32:34.822
- I warned Fischer.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.519
I couldn't be certain
regarding the genetics

32:36.563 --> 32:38.565
of the other warriors.

32:38.608 --> 32:41.176
Or their current identities.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.831
- But yet you knew that
they would be in Iraq.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.008
- Iraq was explicitly
mentioned to me.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.619
Please, allow me.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.187
- By who? By Abraham?

32:52.318 --> 32:55.364
- Yes, by Abraham himself.

32:55.495 --> 32:58.672
He said that Sadam would
be our primary focus.

33:00.282 --> 33:02.850
I can understand
your frustration.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.157
There are 30-million
people in Iraq.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.857
Your task was almost impossible.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.165
- Almost.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.780
- Did you find someone?

33:19.823 --> 33:21.651
- We found a young woman.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.479
No family, no papers.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.006
I worked her,

33:28.136 --> 33:31.226
and I worked her,

33:31.270 --> 33:34.055
and all I got was the name
of a river in Kashmir.

33:36.927 --> 33:38.016
[microwave bleeping]

33:38.059 --> 33:39.191
- Kashmir.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.412
Fischer never mentioned
the girl to me.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.417
Is she being helpful?

33:48.461 --> 33:50.506
- Not since she managed
to kill herself.

33:50.637 --> 33:52.030
- Oh.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.683
Suicide implants.

33:53.727 --> 33:56.425
- No, she slammed her forehead
into the corner of a desk,

33:56.469 --> 33:58.166
rupturing her cortex.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.516
- How awful.

34:00.647 --> 34:03.519
But look at the bright side,

34:03.650 --> 34:06.087
your success did
not go unnoticed.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.612
You earned yourself a promotion.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.009
- [Jefferson]
Sorry to interrupt.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.230
I need you to step out
for a moment, Carmen.

34:20.449 --> 34:24.496
[ominous music]

34:24.627 --> 34:25.976
- What is it?

34:26.107 --> 34:28.456
- Well it's not a
bomb or a weapon.

34:29.806 --> 34:33.114
It wound in the wreckage
of the blast in Mumbai.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.768
- The one a couple of days ago?

34:37.248 --> 34:39.641
- The one that destroyed
an entire industrial block.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.471
No one knows what caused it.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.648
- I bet Ramiro does.

34:48.824 --> 34:50.088
[buzzer]
[door opening]

34:52.351 --> 34:53.873
- Where did you get that?

34:57.356 --> 34:58.313
[chuckles]

34:59.445 --> 35:01.316
It's okay, it's
perfectly harmless.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.753
Please, allow me to show you.

35:06.582 --> 35:09.933
[tense music]

35:14.851 --> 35:18.942
[high-pitched humming]

35:19.073 --> 35:20.901
May I?

35:25.645 --> 35:26.472
[zapping]

35:29.736 --> 35:30.563
- Where did it go?

35:30.693 --> 35:31.738
- Nowhere.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.348
It's just suspended in time.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.220
Temporarily.

35:37.439 --> 35:41.313
Four, three, two, one.

35:41.356 --> 35:42.096
[zapping]

35:43.445 --> 35:45.534
Voila.
[dark atmospheric music]

35:45.665 --> 35:47.145
Which makes it the key component

35:47.275 --> 35:50.060
in the construction of
a portable time machine.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.720
- We need to keep
this off the grid.

35:57.851 --> 36:01.202
No one, and I mean no one,
needs to know about this.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.769
I will brief the
director myself.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.945
- If Abraham gets hold
of a new time machine,

36:05.075 --> 36:06.816
we'd have no defense.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.601
- He'd just go from
city to city setting off

36:08.731 --> 36:11.212
future explosions and...

36:11.343 --> 36:14.346
- [Jefferson] It'll be
Indian Point all over again.

36:14.389 --> 36:17.000
Only 1,000-times worse.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.137
- You didn't sleep, did you?

36:23.268 --> 36:24.573
- No.

36:24.617 --> 36:25.835
- What's going on?

36:27.272 --> 36:29.752
- Well this is going
to sounds crazy.

36:29.796 --> 36:32.015
I saw my son yesterday.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.757
Swear to God it was him.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.455
He had the same walk.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.326
He had the same smile.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.550
Just when you think you're
ready to forgive yourself,

36:44.680 --> 36:46.204
you know?

36:46.334 --> 36:48.206
- Jordan's death
wasn't your fault.

36:49.816 --> 36:51.165
- Yeah it was.

36:52.384 --> 36:55.125
should never be doubted.lt,,

36:55.256 --> 36:56.475
- Look at me.

36:57.954 --> 36:58.999
There was nothing that you
could have done, nothing.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.219
- Yes there was.

37:01.349 --> 37:02.394
There still is.

37:05.135 --> 37:07.181
- What's that supposed to mean?

37:09.531 --> 37:11.838
- Carmen.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.493
Nothing is set in stone.

37:14.623 --> 37:17.322
Time, it's not what it seems.

37:19.106 --> 37:21.239
- What are you talking about?

37:23.632 --> 37:24.851
- Time is nothing.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.463
Nothing.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.727
- Does this have to do with
your Sandbox assignment?

37:33.033 --> 37:35.253
Fischer, come on.

37:35.383 --> 37:38.691
If there's anybody that
you can tell, it's me.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.261
[TV jingle]

37:43.391 --> 37:44.914
- [Voiceover] Breaking news.

37:46.481 --> 37:47.395
- What's that?

37:48.570 --> 37:48.962
- [Voiceover] An
explosion has occured

37:50.529 --> 37:52.618
at the Indian Point power
plant north of New York City.

37:52.748 --> 37:55.969
The radioactive fallout
is rapidly drifting south,

37:56.099 --> 37:58.667
and the President has ordered
the immediate evacuation

37:58.798 --> 38:00.974
of cities in Northern
Pennsylvania,

38:01.104 --> 38:04.282
Virginia and the
entire tri-state area.

38:04.412 --> 38:06.501
- Oh my God.
[bleak atmospheric music]

38:06.632 --> 38:07.981
My sister is in Brooklyn.

38:09.504 --> 38:09.722
- [Newsman] A nuclear device,
likely smuggled on site

38:10.462 --> 38:11.680
via the Hudson River.

38:11.724 --> 38:13.334
Its type and origin
will be determined

38:13.465 --> 38:16.119
once the isotopic signature...

38:16.163 --> 38:20.254
[sorrowful orchestral music]

38:34.616 --> 38:36.923
- [Ellis] Bad news, Fischer.
The tests failed again.

38:36.966 --> 38:40.753
We haven't found a functioning
equation, that's the problem.

38:40.796 --> 38:43.364
- [Fischer] I am this close
to figuring it all out.

38:43.408 --> 38:46.149
And now I'm desperate,
I need help.

38:46.280 --> 38:49.152
- It doesn't make any sense.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.503
Do you know that Fischer
lost his wife and kid?

38:51.633 --> 38:53.548
If he was gonna commit
suicide, he would have done it

38:53.679 --> 38:54.984
a long time ago.

38:55.115 --> 38:58.118
- Maybe it all finally
caught up with him.

38:58.248 --> 39:02.209
[dark atmospheric music]

39:02.340 --> 39:03.558
What is it?

39:05.778 --> 39:07.388
- Signs of a struggle.

39:07.519 --> 39:08.128
Maybe.

39:08.258 --> 39:09.738
[thud]

39:09.782 --> 39:11.827
[scraping]

39:17.790 --> 39:19.966
- Snider, I need
you here please.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.359
Need to do blood--

39:21.489 --> 39:23.448
- [Carmen] And...
- [Jefferson] Wait. Hold on.

39:23.578 --> 39:24.710
Fingerprints?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.494
- I'm betting those
are from Wednesday.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.714
- Bring the chronoscan too.

39:28.844 --> 39:31.369
I need you to date fingerprints.

39:31.499 --> 39:35.373
[machine crackling and whirring]

39:37.375 --> 39:39.377
You think Fischer was murdered.

39:39.507 --> 39:40.682
- One way or another.

39:40.726 --> 39:42.989
- No one's stepped
inside that apartment.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.425
- Wouldn't even talk to
anyone on the phone either.

39:44.556 --> 39:47.167
- The autopsy was clean.

39:47.297 --> 39:49.952
- I think Abraham has
an agent inside Sandbox.

39:49.996 --> 39:53.173
[ominous music]

39:53.303 --> 39:55.088
- Yeah, the prints
are from Wednesday,

39:55.218 --> 39:57.525
and they're Fischer's.

39:57.656 --> 40:00.398
- Sweep the place for
foreign fingerprints.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.748
- Fischer's visitor,
whoever he was,

40:02.878 --> 40:04.576
managed to outsmart
the most advanced

40:04.619 --> 40:06.186
security system in the world.

40:06.316 --> 40:09.189
Do you really think that
he left fingerprints?

40:09.319 --> 40:10.973
- We may get lucky.

40:14.847 --> 40:17.545
- Just when you
think the situation
couldn't get any worse.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.200
- We've implemented Class-3
surveillance protocol

40:20.330 --> 40:21.419
and a comprehensive review

40:21.549 --> 40:24.030
of all Sandbox
personnel is underway.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.467
- Find the mole, Agent
Reese, and quickly.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.251
I don't need to tell you
what's at stake here.

40:28.382 --> 40:31.341
- Sir, I strongly suggest that
we undertake a similar review

40:31.472 --> 40:33.082
of all security agencies.

40:33.213 --> 40:35.389
Irrespective or
seniority, every agent,

40:35.520 --> 40:37.826
every official should
be thoroughly screened.

40:37.957 --> 40:38.436
- I'll recommend it to the--

40:38.566 --> 40:40.307
[dramatic chord]

40:40.438 --> 40:41.569
What is it?

40:46.487 --> 40:48.228
- Uh, nothing.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.099
- Do you think Abraham
is still in India?

40:50.230 --> 40:53.320
- I do. It's a lot easier to
hide among a billion people.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.149
And besides, India gives him
the right technological base

40:56.279 --> 40:58.151
for constructing
his time machine.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.675
- The Indians are
scared shitless.

41:00.719 --> 41:03.286
They're afraid we'll bomb them
into oblivion like Pakistan,

41:03.417 --> 41:05.637
which is exactly what the
President wants to do.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.508
- The Indians are our allies.

41:07.639 --> 41:09.031
I'm sure they're gonna give
us whatever help we need

41:09.075 --> 41:10.511
in finding Abraham.

41:10.642 --> 41:12.905
- We can't tell them about
Abraham, Agent Reese.

41:13.035 --> 41:15.124
Because then we'll have
to tell them about Ramiro,

41:15.255 --> 41:18.867
and that would be giving away
the store now, wouldn't it?

41:18.911 --> 41:22.349
[ominous ambient music]

41:28.442 --> 41:32.881
[indistinct whispers
in foreign language]

41:48.201 --> 41:52.553
- [Child] Birthday,
'cause she was big.

41:52.684 --> 41:55.295
Sally had made a cake.

41:55.425 --> 41:59.342
[adults cheering and clapping]

42:01.954 --> 42:04.522
- [Fischer] I am this close
to figuring it all out.

42:04.565 --> 42:07.350
Now I'm desperate. I need help.

42:07.481 --> 42:08.874
Please, help me.

42:10.745 --> 42:12.791
- [Ramiro] This world
is like a dream, Carmen.

42:12.921 --> 42:15.533
Are you ever
surprised in a dream?

42:21.408 --> 42:22.714
- Fischer.

42:22.757 --> 42:24.324
I missed you so much.

42:24.367 --> 42:25.238
[music swells]

42:25.368 --> 42:26.892
[loud thuds]

42:28.894 --> 42:30.635

42:30.765 --> 42:33.246
[alarm bleeping]

42:33.376 --> 42:36.554
[dark ambient music]

42:36.684 --> 42:37.903
[child's laughter]

42:40.209 --> 42:41.471
[child's laughter]

42:42.472 --> 42:44.431
Hello?

42:44.562 --> 42:45.911
Somebody there?

42:46.041 --> 42:47.956
[door creaking]

42:51.003 --> 42:53.483
[eerie music]
Sandra.

42:54.746 --> 42:57.487
- [Sandra] Catch me if
you can, Aunt Carmen.

43:03.885 --> 43:07.585
[Ramiro groaning]

43:08.934 --> 43:12.067
[Ramiro screaming]
[helicopter blades whirring]

43:12.198 --> 43:16.376
[intense atmospheric music]

43:19.118 --> 43:23.252
[bleak atmospheric music]

43:35.308 --> 43:36.962
[door opening]

43:42.837 --> 43:43.882
[door closing]

43:59.724 --> 44:01.247
- What do you mean
the camera's offline?

44:01.290 --> 44:03.075
- [Paul] Only for
about 10 seconds.

44:03.118 --> 44:06.252
It happens every 24 hours when
the camera does a re-sync.

44:06.382 --> 44:08.689
- Which Jim obviously knew.

44:08.820 --> 44:10.691
Okay Williams,
keep an eye on him.

44:10.822 --> 44:12.040
Send me his file.

44:12.084 --> 44:12.867
- [Paul] Will do.

44:12.998 --> 44:14.260
One more thing, Agent Reese,

44:14.390 --> 44:16.436
I'm not sure what to
make of it but it seems

44:16.566 --> 44:19.657
that Jefferson's been
communicating with
someone secretly.

44:19.700 --> 44:20.832
- Secretly?

44:22.181 --> 44:22.877
- [Paul] He sent a couple
messages last night

44:24.226 --> 44:25.532
then deleted the log
entries from the mainframe

44:25.663 --> 44:27.273
but he forgot the backup.

44:27.403 --> 44:28.709
- Messages to whom?

44:28.840 --> 44:31.277
- [Paul] Someone
at the Pentagon.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.670
Ah, it's probably nothing.

44:32.800 --> 44:33.888
Maybe we should just--

44:35.368 --> 44:36.674
- Find out exactly who he's
been communicating with.

44:36.717 --> 44:39.372
And be careful,
don't tip him off.

44:48.729 --> 44:50.078
- Elmez.

44:50.209 --> 44:52.080
That's where I'm from.

44:54.300 --> 44:57.695
It's a city in the
Balkan Peninsula that
doesn't exist yet,

44:58.913 --> 45:01.699
and in the time
that I come from,

45:01.829 --> 45:02.874
[muffled gunfire]

45:03.004 --> 45:05.703
it doesn't anymore.

45:05.833 --> 45:08.618
[muffled gunfire]

45:08.749 --> 45:10.882
It was destroyed during
the liberation of Albania

45:11.012 --> 45:12.710
by the United States.

45:14.320 --> 45:17.062
the last Islamic republic Ff

45:17.192 --> 45:18.890
in the world.

45:19.020 --> 45:20.848
- But what happened to the
rest, did the U.S. invade

45:20.979 --> 45:22.720
all the Muslim countries?

45:22.763 --> 45:24.286
- They didn't have to.

45:25.984 --> 45:27.986
They played the Arabs
against the Persians,

45:28.116 --> 45:31.119
the Asians against the Africans,

45:31.163 --> 45:33.905
and watched them
devour each other.

45:35.254 --> 45:36.734
Paranoia.

45:38.736 --> 45:41.651
It's the greatest
weapon there is.

45:41.782 --> 45:44.089
- So that's why you're here.

45:44.219 --> 45:46.831
But how, this whole
time-travel thing just seems

45:46.961 --> 45:48.746
preposterous to me.

45:50.312 --> 45:52.837
- I figured you'd ask.

45:52.967 --> 45:55.840
This should give you some idea.

46:02.934 --> 46:03.761
- [Fischer] Has this
something to do with the

46:03.891 --> 46:04.849
casimir effect?

46:06.198 --> 46:06.981
- Fischer.

46:08.374 --> 46:09.767
I'm impressed.

46:11.420 --> 46:13.422
- Parallel plates sat so close
together that they tap into

46:13.553 --> 46:15.250
the energy field of a vacuum.

46:15.381 --> 46:18.601
- Which then punches a
hole through space-time.

46:18.732 --> 46:20.560
- How was the machine tested?

46:20.690 --> 46:22.867
Was an object sent
into some distant past

46:22.997 --> 46:24.390
and then just dug up
from a fossil bed?

46:24.520 --> 46:26.174
[Ramiro chuckles]

46:26.305 --> 46:28.568
- That can't be done, my friend.

46:28.611 --> 46:29.830
- Why not?

46:29.961 --> 46:31.484
- Because when you
go back in time,

46:31.614 --> 46:34.182
an alternate reality is created.

46:34.313 --> 46:38.056
A new timeline branching
out from the original one.

46:38.186 --> 46:42.408
It's the Universe's way of
preventing time-paradoxes.

46:42.451 --> 46:43.757
Like I said before,

46:45.324 --> 46:46.978
we can't change the past.

46:47.108 --> 46:49.807
- But we can create a new one.

46:49.937 --> 46:52.940
- And nudge it in any
direction we want.

46:56.944 --> 46:59.599
- So when did you
time-travelling
Jihadists arrive?

46:59.642 --> 47:01.470
- September 9th, 1999.

47:01.601 --> 47:02.820
- Where?

47:02.863 --> 47:04.604
- Kashmir, near the Shyok River.

47:04.647 --> 47:06.432
- Why Kashmir?

47:06.562 --> 47:09.261
- Because that's where the
time machine was in my day.

47:09.391 --> 47:11.829
Point-to-point transfer
is how it works.

47:11.959 --> 47:12.830
- How many came?

47:12.960 --> 47:14.962
- 99 of us.

47:15.093 --> 47:17.008
- So on the ninth day,
of the ninth month,

47:17.138 --> 47:20.011
of the 99th year, 99
of your guys show up.

47:20.141 --> 47:22.622
- Nine is of
special significance

47:22.665 --> 47:25.016
in Islamic number-theory.

47:25.146 --> 47:27.279
It denotes Judgement Day.

47:27.409 --> 47:31.022
[ominous music]

47:31.152 --> 47:32.675
- I see.

47:35.765 --> 47:38.725
So what can you tell me
about your leader Abraham?

47:39.682 --> 47:41.075
- He's the smartest...

47:42.468 --> 47:44.992
The most tenacious
man I've ever met.

47:50.737 --> 47:53.566
Also the most ruthless.

47:53.696 --> 47:55.916
No one knows exactly where
he's from but he was born

47:56.047 --> 47:58.876
into one of the richest
families in the world.

47:59.006 --> 48:02.705
He used his entire inheritance
preparing for this mission.

48:02.836 --> 48:04.925
- Wait. It's the future.

48:06.187 --> 48:07.275
- Pardon me?

48:09.016 --> 48:10.757
- That's how the
machine was tested.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.367
If an object is
sent to the past,

48:12.498 --> 48:14.717
it lands up in a new reality,

48:14.761 --> 48:16.937
there's no way of retrieving it.

48:17.068 --> 48:19.070
But if it's sent into
the future, it remains

48:19.113 --> 48:21.899
in the same
timeline, doesn't it?

48:22.029 --> 48:23.509
Because the future
hasn't occurred yet,

48:23.552 --> 48:25.815
there aren't any
paradoxes, am I right?

48:25.946 --> 48:29.689
- The test object was sent a
few minutes into the future.

48:29.819 --> 48:31.996
And there it appeared.

48:32.126 --> 48:33.998
Just out of thin air.

48:34.128 --> 48:35.913
- Which makes me wonder.

48:40.004 --> 48:43.311
What would happen if you
threw small lumps of uranium

48:43.442 --> 48:45.313
ahead in time

48:45.444 --> 48:47.968
and aimed them to appear
at the exact same place,

48:48.099 --> 48:50.928
at the exact same moment?

48:51.058 --> 48:55.019
All that nuclear material pumped
into the same tiny volume.

48:57.021 --> 48:59.371
What kind of boom
would that make?

48:59.501 --> 49:03.027
[ominous music intensifies]

49:09.729 --> 49:11.861
[tape rewinding]

49:11.992 --> 49:13.341
What kind of boom
would that make?

49:15.039 --> 49:17.563
- [Carmen] Abraham
was constructing a
portable time-machine.

49:17.606 --> 49:20.392
- [Jefferson] Well now we know
why he was hiding from us.

49:20.522 --> 49:21.828
- Why tell us now?

49:23.003 --> 49:25.179
I mean, if Ramiro
hadn't have shown us,

49:25.223 --> 49:27.834
we never would have guessed
what that device was for.

49:30.619 --> 49:33.405
Have you considered
the possibility

49:33.535 --> 49:36.799
that his accident was staged?

49:36.843 --> 49:38.976
That he was sent
here on purpose--

49:39.019 --> 49:40.151
- No.

49:40.194 --> 49:41.065
- That he remains
here by choice.

49:41.195 --> 49:42.370
- Nonsense.

49:43.850 --> 49:45.678
- Okay, there's 329 nano
devices in that guy's body.

49:45.808 --> 49:48.637
For all we know, he could walk
through the fucking walls.

49:48.768 --> 49:50.117
- Then why would he
undermine his mission

49:50.248 --> 49:50.988
with all this intel?

49:51.118 --> 49:53.207
It was perfectly credible.

49:53.251 --> 49:55.166
Wherever he sent us
we found hard-evidence

49:55.209 --> 49:56.602
that Abraham and his
men has been there.

49:56.732 --> 50:00.606
In some cases, only a few
days before we showed up.

50:00.649 --> 50:03.174
Okay, it would be
terrific if we could

50:03.304 --> 50:05.002
get a hold of one
of Ramiro's buddies

50:05.132 --> 50:09.049
and corroborate his story
but until that happens...

50:10.224 --> 50:12.400
- ll what about the
woman that I found?

50:12.444 --> 50:14.011
From Baghdad. She talked, right?

50:14.141 --> 50:16.839
- She talked, she sang.

50:16.883 --> 50:18.363
The interrogation
she was put through,

50:18.493 --> 50:22.019
she told us exactly
what we needed to hear.

50:22.149 --> 50:24.630
- Are you suggesting
that she wasn't real?

50:24.673 --> 50:27.198
- They told her
apart, cell-by-cell.

50:27.328 --> 50:29.635
Not one nano device,
not one extra gene

50:29.765 --> 50:31.506
was found in her body.

50:31.637 --> 50:35.249
[ominous music]

50:37.034 --> 50:38.165
[phone ringing]

50:40.820 --> 50:42.300
- The Sec-Def, are you sure?

50:42.430 --> 50:43.866
- [Paul] Positive.

50:43.997 --> 50:46.391
Jefferson sent those
messages directly to him,

50:46.521 --> 50:48.741
bypassing his chief of staff.

50:48.871 --> 50:50.525
- The Secretary of Defense.

50:50.656 --> 50:53.050
- [Paul] And, I
discovered something else.

50:53.093 --> 50:54.921
Over the past year
we've had a few glitches

50:55.052 --> 50:56.488
with our video recorders.

50:56.618 --> 51:00.057
On five separate occasions
the same software error

51:00.187 --> 51:03.756
caused entire interrogation
sessions to be erased.

51:03.886 --> 51:05.714
- Do you think that
was done on purpose?

51:05.845 --> 51:07.064
- [Paul] Now I know it was.

51:07.194 --> 51:09.327
On Jefferson's orders.

51:18.945 --> 51:20.555
- Why didn't you tell me about
the secret interrogations?

51:20.686 --> 51:22.166
- What secret interrogations?

51:22.296 --> 51:24.777
- Don't fuck with me, Jefferson.

51:24.907 --> 51:26.735
- They were Fischer's
idea and I okayed them.

51:26.866 --> 51:28.085
- Why?

51:29.651 --> 51:30.087
- Look, I don't think I need
to remind you, Agent Reese,

51:31.218 --> 51:32.089
that I have full
authority to do so.

51:33.612 --> 51:35.092
- So do I, Commander Jefferson,
to demand an explanation.

51:35.222 --> 51:37.137
- Some of things that
Ramiro were telling us

51:37.268 --> 51:38.443
were damn-right scary.

51:39.922 --> 51:40.575
The kind of things that
are best kept off the grid.

51:40.706 --> 51:43.187
- What kind of things?

51:43.317 --> 51:45.102
- Ramiro suspected that

51:45.232 --> 51:47.974
another country,
an enemy of ours,

51:48.105 --> 51:50.803
has also captured
one of Abraham's men.

51:52.196 --> 51:53.110
- Based on what?

51:53.240 --> 51:54.894
- His intuition.

51:55.024 --> 51:58.071
Which psychological tests have
shown is highly-developed.

51:58.202 --> 52:01.118
[Carmen chuckles]

52:02.206 --> 52:04.817
- Wow. His intuition.

52:04.947 --> 52:07.167
He didn't happen to say
which country, did he?

52:07.298 --> 52:08.690
- No.

52:10.823 --> 52:13.130
- And what about the last
time Fischer went in?

52:13.260 --> 52:15.567
- I had nothing to do
with that and you know it.

52:15.697 --> 52:20.180
Ripping cables off a camera
is no way of keeping a secret.

52:21.703 --> 52:24.532
- Fischer didn't care.

52:24.576 --> 52:28.145
He knew Ramiro was gonna
tell him something so scary

52:28.275 --> 52:29.929
he didn't wanna take a risk

52:29.972 --> 52:32.323
and Ramiro didn't disappoint.

52:33.802 --> 52:36.805
And then his mysterious
visitor appeared,

52:36.936 --> 52:38.938
and whatever transpired next,

52:39.068 --> 52:42.811
drained away any hope Fischer
had of saving the situation.

52:42.942 --> 52:45.814
As far as he was concerned,

52:45.945 --> 52:47.381
it was game over.

52:47.512 --> 52:50.210
[ominous music]

52:50.341 --> 52:52.169
- What did Ramiro tell him?

52:52.299 --> 52:53.866
- [Carmen] I wish I knew.

52:55.433 --> 52:58.784
- Maybe he revealed theidentity of Abraham's agent.

53:00.438 --> 53:02.048
- That's an interesting thought.

53:02.179 --> 53:05.312
- But then, why would
Fischer kill himself, right?

53:05.443 --> 53:07.880
I mean, wouldn't he just
tell me like he always did

53:08.010 --> 53:10.012
after every single session?

53:11.623 --> 53:13.407
- I don't know. You tell me.

53:16.671 --> 53:19.108
- What's that supposed to mean?

53:19.239 --> 53:22.024
- [Newsman] Violence in the
Chinese province of Hunan.

53:22.155 --> 53:25.376
An overnight raid by Muslim
separatists on an army barrack

53:25.419 --> 53:29.118
resulted in the death
of four PLA soldiers.

53:29.249 --> 53:30.903
Meanwhile, the Foreign
Ministry announced that

53:31.033 --> 53:33.601
the Chinese Premier will
travel to Russia next week.

53:33.732 --> 53:36.213
The talks are aimed at
increasing cooperation to combat

53:36.343 --> 53:40.260
the growing Islamic insurgencies
in the two countries.

53:40.391 --> 53:44.264
A U.S. military build up in
the Indian Ocean continues.

53:44.308 --> 53:46.266
Today, two aircraft
carrier battle--

53:46.397 --> 53:47.659
- [Director] But what's that
got to do with any of this?

53:47.789 --> 53:49.878
- What if Abraham is
arming the separatists?

53:50.009 --> 53:51.489
They seem to be gaining
ground both in Russia

53:51.619 --> 53:53.099
and in China.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.883
- I still don't see why
we shouldn't strike India.

53:55.014 --> 53:56.581
- Because we don't even
know if he's there.

53:56.711 --> 53:58.670
- Well last time you
seemed pretty sure.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.280
- Iraq turned out
to be a handful

54:00.411 --> 54:02.239
and India is no Iraq.

54:02.369 --> 54:04.153
- We're a lot wise
now, Agent Reese.

54:04.284 --> 54:05.938
We know exactly what
to do this time.

54:06.068 --> 54:07.026
- Well don't you think
we should wait for some

54:07.156 --> 54:08.288
positive intel?

54:09.724 --> 54:10.203
- How can we wait when the
weapon we're up against

54:10.334 --> 54:12.161
is time itself?

54:12.292 --> 54:13.859
[phone ringing]

54:15.339 --> 54:16.731
Yes?

54:16.862 --> 54:18.733
What do they want?

54:18.864 --> 54:20.300
What the hell?

54:22.694 --> 54:23.216
[static]

54:24.348 --> 54:27.307
[beeping]

54:37.274 --> 54:40.712
- Kashmir. It's
a gorgeous place.

54:40.842 --> 54:44.150
But your arrival site
is even more impressive.

54:44.281 --> 54:46.979
It's like a passing
god has sneezed.

54:47.109 --> 54:50.678
Circle 50-feet-across
has been swept clear.

54:50.809 --> 54:52.201
And after all these years,

54:52.332 --> 54:55.509
the soil still
remains magnetized.

54:55.640 --> 54:58.730
But you know what
surprises me, Ramiro?

54:58.860 --> 55:01.863
Is that the local villagers
didn't see any strangers

55:01.907 --> 55:03.648
in the area.

55:03.691 --> 55:05.911
Not even one.

55:05.954 --> 55:07.739
- We travelled in small groups.

55:07.782 --> 55:11.351
Over the mountains towards
Pakistan and at night only.

55:11.482 --> 55:13.571
- But still, there
was 100 of you.

55:15.137 --> 55:17.314
So you made your way
to Canada via Europe.

55:17.444 --> 55:19.141
- The rest were
to slip into Iraq.

55:19.272 --> 55:20.534
That was the plan.

55:22.144 --> 55:23.450
- They lied to you.

55:25.060 --> 55:27.498
I don't think anyone from your
group stepped foot in Iraq.

55:27.541 --> 55:29.891
- But you said you found a girl.

55:30.022 --> 55:31.763
- It was a bluff.

55:31.893 --> 55:34.418
I wanted to see how you'd react.

55:35.854 --> 55:38.770
But when Iraq turned up
empty, people panicked.

55:38.813 --> 55:40.685
I mean, there was a lot of
other U.S.-hating dictators

55:40.815 --> 55:43.731
for Abraham to arm,
not to mention ISIS

55:43.775 --> 55:47.213
but you insisted on
Iran and Pakistan.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.389
Countries that you knew
we would have no chance

55:49.520 --> 55:51.696
of orchestrating a
popular revolution.

55:51.826 --> 55:55.526
- That's precisely why I
thought Abraham might be there.

55:55.569 --> 55:56.962
- Precisely.

55:58.442 --> 56:01.445
- not my fault that things
turned out the way they did.

56:01.575 --> 56:04.970
You people rushed to war.

56:05.013 --> 56:07.407
- Iran maybe, but
Pakistan was a no-brainer.

56:07.451 --> 56:09.757
I mean, if they could shelter
Bin Laden for so many years,

56:09.801 --> 56:11.455
they bloody-well
could do Abraham.

56:11.585 --> 56:13.282
- And now it's India's turn.

56:13.413 --> 56:17.548
[ominous music]

56:17.678 --> 56:19.376
- How did you know about that?

56:19.506 --> 56:21.552
- Well you found the device.

56:21.682 --> 56:23.989
- I didn't tell you the
device was in India.

56:25.207 --> 56:26.774
- I hear the guards talking.

56:26.818 --> 56:29.037
- The guards know nothing.

56:29.168 --> 56:31.779
- Then I must have
another source.

56:34.782 --> 56:38.003
- So Abraham hasn't
abandoned you after all.

56:39.483 --> 56:42.268
's got an agent in here,
helping you run the show,

56:42.399 --> 56:43.965
because that's what
this is, isn't it?

56:44.009 --> 56:45.314
Is a show.

56:45.445 --> 56:47.273
Your accident, your capture.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.449
15 years of bullshit!

56:49.580 --> 56:52.278
All designed to send us
on a wild-goose chase,

56:52.409 --> 56:54.411
invading country after country,

56:54.541 --> 56:57.326
keeping us from where
we really need to be.

56:57.457 --> 56:58.458
- Slow down.

56:58.589 --> 56:59.633
Hm?

57:00.939 --> 57:01.505
Where would you get a
crazy idea like that?

57:01.635 --> 57:02.419
- It's the truth!

57:02.549 --> 57:04.421
Admit it!

57:04.551 --> 57:05.683
[Ramiro sighs]

57:07.119 --> 57:10.427
- You really need to
get some sleep, Carmen,

57:10.557 --> 57:12.298
because now,

57:12.429 --> 57:15.083
you're just hallucinating.

57:15.214 --> 57:16.433
- You fuckin'...

57:16.563 --> 57:17.695
[tense music]

57:17.825 --> 57:19.653
Make you pay for my sister!
[thud]

57:19.784 --> 57:20.698
For Fischer!
[thud]

57:20.828 --> 57:22.221
For my niece!
[thud]

57:22.351 --> 57:23.309
Everyone else!
[thud]

57:23.440 --> 57:24.615
- Step back.

57:24.745 --> 57:26.138
Stop it.

57:28.532 --> 57:30.142
- Get on the floor.
[tense music]

57:30.272 --> 57:31.360
- What?

57:31.491 --> 57:32.449
- [Carmen] Get on
the God-damn floor.

57:32.579 --> 57:33.841
- What are you doing, ma'am?

57:33.972 --> 57:35.669
- You working for this
son of a bitch now?

57:35.800 --> 57:36.540
Huh?

57:36.670 --> 57:39.630
You an agent for Abraham?

57:39.760 --> 57:41.283
- What?

57:41.414 --> 57:43.677
- I saw you, Jim. In
the electrical room.

57:43.808 --> 57:45.374
What have you got in
there, a com device?

57:45.505 --> 57:46.463
A weapon?

57:47.725 --> 57:48.726
- It's nothing, ma'am.
It's just some weed.

57:50.945 --> 57:52.120
- Weed?

57:52.251 --> 57:53.513
- Look, they search
our quarters regularly.

57:53.644 --> 57:55.167
There's nowhere else to hide it.

57:55.297 --> 57:57.125
- What's going on here?

58:00.477 --> 58:02.174
- Then it's you.

58:02.304 --> 58:03.523
You're the mole.

58:03.654 --> 58:06.265
[dramatic music]

58:06.395 --> 58:08.485
Why else would you send
secret messages to the Sec-Def

58:08.615 --> 58:09.877
and then cover your tracks?

58:10.008 --> 58:11.488
- You're out of
your fuckin' mind.

58:11.618 --> 58:13.359
- [Carmen] Why?

58:13.490 --> 58:14.273
- Get her out of here.

58:14.403 --> 58:15.666
- Who else is involved? Huh?

58:15.796 --> 58:17.537
Who are the other traitors?

58:17.668 --> 58:19.931
- Bring her to detention, now.

58:26.024 --> 58:26.938
[gunshot]

58:28.069 --> 58:28.548
- I was trying to
be discreet, okay?

58:30.071 --> 58:31.333
It was a personal matter I
talked to the Sec-Def about.

58:31.377 --> 58:34.119
- A personal matter. Really.

58:34.162 --> 58:36.513
- My daughter is on one
of those aircraft carriers

58:36.556 --> 58:37.949
headed for the Indian Ocean.

58:38.079 --> 58:41.126
I'm gonna get her
transferred back to base.

58:41.256 --> 58:43.215
It's inappropriate,
I know but right now

58:43.345 --> 58:45.347
I don't give a rat's ass.

58:45.478 --> 58:48.350
I'll do whatever I can
to protect my family.

58:48.481 --> 58:50.570
Wouldn't you?
[ominous music]

58:50.701 --> 58:52.572
- But you didn't, Carmen.

58:52.703 --> 58:55.357
You abandoned your family!

58:55.401 --> 58:57.011
No wonder you can't sleep.

58:57.142 --> 59:00.101
Guilt, as they say,

59:00.145 --> 59:02.234
should never be doubted.

59:02.364 --> 59:04.366
- No.
[tense music swelling]

59:05.629 --> 59:07.239
- Calm down.

59:07.369 --> 59:08.588
What's the matter with you?

59:08.719 --> 59:12.592
[Carmen panting]
[dark atmospheric music]

59:12.723 --> 59:13.985
- Fischer had a lot
of faith in you.

59:14.115 --> 59:16.117
I think you're delusional.

59:26.998 --> 59:30.610
Your mission here is
terminated, Agent Reese.

59:30.741 --> 59:32.743
Now get out of my facility.

59:39.314 --> 59:41.142
- [Fischer] Things have
gotten strange, Carmen.

59:41.273 --> 59:42.491
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

59:42.622 --> 59:44.624
- [Sister] You
abandoned your family!

59:44.755 --> 59:46.365
- [Fischer] I saw
my son yesterday.

59:46.495 --> 59:48.236
- [Carmen] No wonder
you can't sleep.

59:48.367 --> 59:50.543
- [Fischer] Guilt, as they
say, should never be doubted.

59:50.674 --> 59:54.460
- [Sister] Guilt, as they
say, should never be doubted.

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:10.998
[phone ringing]

01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:14.611
[phone ringing]

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:18.484
- [Voiceover]
Agent Carmen Reese?

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:19.703
- Yep.

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:21.400
- [Voiceover] Please
hold for the President.

01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:24.795
[footsteps]

01:00:26.492 --> 01:00:27.667
[high-pitched whir]

01:00:27.798 --> 01:00:28.886
[bleeping]

01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:35.022
[buzzer]
[door hissing open]

01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:42.813
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.877
[helicopter blades whirring]
[metal detector whining]

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:34.821
- Mr. President.

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:38.912
- Well you've certainly ruffled
a few feathers, Agent Reese.

01:01:38.956 --> 01:01:41.959
I haven't seen the Sec-Def this
steamed up in a long while.

01:01:42.089 --> 01:01:43.656
Jefferson too.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:44.962
- It was a mistake.

01:01:45.092 --> 01:01:46.964
I went overboard with
my suspicions, sir.

01:01:47.094 --> 01:01:50.707
- No, you did exactly what was
needed in times like these.

01:01:52.578 --> 01:01:54.711
We could use more
people like you.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.715
The NSA sent this over today.

01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:00.368
They now believe that
Abraham and his men

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:03.720
have the capability to
impersonate anyone they want

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:06.113
through genetic manipulation.

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.161
Can you imagine that?

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:11.728
Anyone.

01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:20.519
Did you know that on the
day Indian Point was bombed,

01:02:20.562 --> 01:02:22.739
Fischer was out on leave?

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:26.743
- And?

01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:28.788
- Maybe he was one of them.

01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:32.792
- Sir, if Fischer was one of
Abraham's men then maybe I am.

01:02:32.923 --> 01:02:33.750
Maybe you are too.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.230
- How dare you.

01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:37.884
- Maybe you don't even know it.

01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:40.974
If our enemies have the
ability to impersonate us,

01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:42.802
they could rewire our brains.

01:02:42.933 --> 01:02:44.195
I mean, why not start
with the President

01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:45.631
of the United States?

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:46.763
- Well what happened
about Fischer then?

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:48.939
If he was innocent, why
did he kill himself?

01:02:52.072 --> 01:02:53.465
- I think it had something
to do with the message

01:02:53.595 --> 01:02:55.728
that he got from Doctor
Ellis a few days earlier.

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.164
- From Project Sigma.

01:02:57.295 --> 01:03:00.602
- Fischer was close to
figuring something out.

01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:03.780
He confronted Ramiro, we
have no idea what was said,

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.565
but Ramiro told him something

01:03:06.608 --> 01:03:09.002
that devastated him.

01:03:09.046 --> 01:03:12.484
- Fischer was already feeling
guilty and his visitor--

01:03:12.614 --> 01:03:13.833
- The mole?

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:17.576
- Fischer's visitor wasn't
one of Abraham's agents.

01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:19.056
- Then who was he?

01:03:19.186 --> 01:03:23.843
[dark atmospheric music]

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.802
- Do you realize
what you've done?

01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:29.457
All those lives lost.

01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:31.677
All the destruction.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.766
It's all your fault, Dad.

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:39.380
- Jordan, please stop.

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:40.817
Please stop. [sobbing]

01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:43.820
- What, you want me
to fucking pity you?

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:44.821
You want me to
take you in my arms

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.301
and tell you everything
will be okay?

01:03:48.302 --> 01:03:52.306
[muffled chatter]

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:58.835
- Stop. [sobbing]

01:03:58.965 --> 01:04:00.227
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:01.185
You're a God-damn hallucination.

01:04:01.228 --> 01:04:03.056
[thud]

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.232
- You wanna get rid of me?
[tense atmospheric music]

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:07.104
There's only one way to do that.

01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:10.455
And you know what it is.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.288
- [Turner] Fischer's dead son?

01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:20.204
- Jordan died of a
drug overdose, Fischer
was a single dad,

01:04:20.334 --> 01:04:21.683
he blamed himself.

01:04:21.814 --> 01:04:23.555
- But what's this
gotta do with Ramiro?

01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:26.036
- Because Ramiro
was the only one

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.342
that could give Fischer the
redemption that he needed

01:04:28.473 --> 01:04:30.040
in the form of a time machine.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:31.476
That's why Fischer
was so desperate

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:33.870
to make Project Sigma work.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.046
Whatever Ramiro told him
that day shattered it,

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.830
once and for all.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.963
- And that caused
him to hallucinate?

01:04:40.093 --> 01:04:42.139
- No, that was because
of his hyper-insomnia

01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:44.532
which he'd had at Sandbox
since he got there.

01:04:44.663 --> 01:04:46.926
- And how in all the world
would you possibly know that,

01:04:47.057 --> 01:04:48.754
Agent Reese?

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.539
- I knew Fischer very well, sir.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:55.326
And, I've been having the
same thing at Sandbox.

01:04:55.456 --> 01:04:57.154
Insomnia, hallucinations--

01:04:57.284 --> 01:05:01.158
- And you think
Ramiro's doing this.

01:05:02.594 --> 01:05:03.943
[phone ringing]

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:06.903
[phone ringing]

01:05:08.513 --> 01:05:09.731
Yes?

01:05:11.342 --> 01:05:12.691
Okay, do it.

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:18.479
Civil liberties are the least
of my concern right now.

01:05:21.656 --> 01:05:24.529
His name came up during
an internal review.

01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:26.618
- What did he do?

01:05:26.748 --> 01:05:27.924
- Nothing.

01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:34.104
Thank you coming, Agent Reese.

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:37.107
I'm gonna reinstate you
to your job for now.

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:40.893
I don't care what you
do, who you piss off,

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:44.810
just get me results, and soon.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:45.985
- [Carmen] Yes, sir.

01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:51.730
[helicopter blades whirring]

01:05:58.650 --> 01:05:59.956
- [Ramiro] You can't
change the past.

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:01.435
- [Fischer] But we
can create a new one.

01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:04.134
- And nudge it in any
direction we want.

01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:06.223
- What if Abraham is
arming the separatists?

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:08.965
They seem to be gaining ground
both in Russia and in China.

01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:09.966
- How many came?

01:06:10.096 --> 01:06:11.402
- 99 of us.

01:06:11.532 --> 01:06:14.013
We traveled in small
groups over the mountains

01:06:14.144 --> 01:06:15.362
towards Pakistan.

01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:17.408
- [Ellis] We haven't found
a functioning equation.

01:06:17.538 --> 01:06:18.975
That's the problem.

01:06:19.105 --> 01:06:21.064
- [Ramiro] They played the
Arabs against the Persians,

01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:23.457
the Asians against the Africans

01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:25.982
and watched them
devour each other.

01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:29.942
[dramatic music]

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:33.598
- Paranoia, the greatest
weapon there is.

01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:35.078
Mr. President.

01:06:36.688 --> 01:06:38.472
- What now, Agent Reese?

01:06:39.517 --> 01:06:41.823
- Mr. ident, I can
get you what you want.

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:44.000
But I need full-authority,
level five clearance.

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:45.653
- Level five?

01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:48.178
- I know you don't trust
anybody right now, sir,

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:50.832
but you don't have
another option.

01:06:53.313 --> 01:06:56.012
[tense music swelling]

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:04.020

[door knock]

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.293

01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:18.425
[door knock]

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:20.210

[door knock]

01:07:26.346 --> 01:07:28.131
- I've been pounding on
the door, are you okay?

01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:30.481
- Yeah. Yeah, Jefferson.

01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:32.700
Look, I'm sorry. I
owe you an apology.

01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:34.833
- Yeah well you can
forget about it.

01:07:34.963 --> 01:07:36.269
Russia's been hit.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.489
- [Carmen] Hit?
- [Jefferson] Moscow.

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:41.840
Half a megaton.
[air raid siren]

01:07:41.883 --> 01:07:43.146
- Holy shit.

01:07:43.276 --> 01:07:45.887
- And it's gonna get worse.

01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:47.498
Seems in the chaos
after Indian Point,

01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:49.630
someone with the necessary
skills ripped open

01:07:49.761 --> 01:07:53.243
an airforce bunker and
took eight warheads.

01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:57.029
This is just one of them.

01:07:58.813 --> 01:08:01.642
Looks like someone wants
payback for Indian Point.

01:08:01.773 --> 01:08:03.340
- Yeah but the Russians
weren't responsible.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:05.429
I mean, at least not directly.

01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:09.085
- Clearly not
everyone believes it.

01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:10.216
- What's the word
from the Kremlin?

01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:12.088
- There is no Kremlin.

01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:14.177
Luckily, their
President was talking

01:08:14.307 --> 01:08:16.353
to the Chinese Premier
in Saint Petersburg.

01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:19.356
We've talked to him a
couple of times since.

01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:22.533
I have to talk to the
Sec-Def for further updates.

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:25.100
- Okay, I'll talk to my sources
and see what I can find out.

01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:27.363
I'll call you in a bit.

01:08:27.493 --> 01:08:29.930
- I appreciate the apology.

01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.194
I guess I overreacted too.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:51.736
- It was with profound
shock and sadness

01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:53.129
that I learned of the
devastating attack on Moscow.

01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:55.218
[phone bleeping]

01:08:55.348 --> 01:08:58.786
On behalf of every American,

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:02.616
I wanna offer my
deepest condolences
to the Russian people.

01:09:04.051 --> 01:09:05.184
[phone ringing]

01:09:05.314 --> 01:09:06.533
- [Jefferson] So
what's happening?

01:09:08.055 --> 01:09:09.188
- Russian generals are pressing
for immediate retaliation,

01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:10.015
but the President is
willing to give us

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.191
the benefit of the doubt.

01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:14.106

another blast happens--

01:09:19.894 --> 01:09:20.286

01:09:20.852 --> 01:09:21.374
- Of freedom.

01:09:22.506 --> 01:09:24.421
We will stand against
them as our...

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:30.340

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.080

01:09:33.386 --> 01:09:34.779
- [Jefferson] Saint
Petersburg and Volgograd

01:09:34.822 --> 01:09:35.649
have just been hit.

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:37.999
We're going into full lock-down.

slept in four days.

01:12:37.483 --> 01:12:39.355
This morning he
didn't even pray.

01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:43.489
[Jefferson] Should
we tell him something?

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:46.971
- Let the uncertainty
gnaw at him.

01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:49.060
We've got him by the balls.

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:51.323

What's the use now?

Lincoln Nebraska, Jim?

01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:11.082
Your family, are they well?

01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:17.436
There's been
another attack, yes?

01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:19.307
[dark ambient music]

01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:22.006
Did the Indians sneak
in a couple of nukes?

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:27.446
Was a nearby military
base hit, or...

01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:28.404
A reactor, yes, of course.

01:13:29.492 --> 01:13:29.622
- We should get
him out of there.

01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:31.319
- No, wait.

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.365
- How long will we have to wait?

01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:36.368
Two weeks?

01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.762
A month, to be rescued?

01:13:46.117 --> 01:13:47.466
- A couple of nukes?

01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:51.514
Try 1,000.

01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:55.474
Every major city
has been wiped out.

01:13:55.605 --> 01:13:58.434
Wild fires and poisonous rain
are taking care of the rest.

01:13:58.564 --> 01:14:01.698
You can't tell the difference
between night and day,

01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:04.875
and forty-below is
the warmest it gets.

01:14:05.005 --> 01:14:07.355
- The Indians did this?

01:14:07.486 --> 01:14:09.445
- First it was the Russians
then the Chinese joined in

01:14:09.575 --> 01:14:12.317
but we bombed them
into the Stone Age.

01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:14.841
- Shit.

01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:17.061

01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:19.324

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.641
And put your gun down.

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:34.165
I will shoot if I have to.

01:14:36.863 --> 01:14:38.735

01:14:38.865 --> 01:14:40.563
Take it easy, okay?

01:14:40.693 --> 01:14:44.044
Killing him is not
gonna change anything.

01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:45.872

you talking about?

01:14:48.745 --> 01:14:50.486
We're done.

We're dead already.

Okay? You just need to trust me.

01:14:58.145 --> 01:14:58.842

A nuclear winter?
The end of all of us?

were so weak, reckless,

01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:40.536

01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:42.538

there's just you.

You arrive in Kashmir, alone.

A little bit of uranium.

A few odd gizmos

01:16:00.817 --> 01:16:03.602
enough physical evidence to
give your story some legs.

01:16:05.517 --> 01:16:09.477
I mean, why send an entire
army when one soldier

01:16:09.608 --> 01:16:12.393
armed with the right words
will do just as well?

01:16:13.394 --> 01:16:14.918
You were right.

I will give you that.

Draw the U.S. into

01:16:29.802 --> 01:16:33.284

01:16:34.502 --> 01:16:36.809
15, 20 years from now,

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.420
this world would

Fischer ever was.

01:16:57.787 --> 01:16:59.615
You just told him the truth.

And the poor guy realized that
every life that had been lost

01:17:08.058 --> 01:17:10.626
was because he
fell for your lies.

01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:13.063

You are like this,

You came here to torture us.

based on 99 of these guys.

01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:16.621
- I don't remember any equation.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.189
- You can remember
the coordinates of
dozens of supernovae

01:19:19.319 --> 01:19:21.713
but you can't remember
a single equation.

01:19:21.844 --> 01:19:23.410
- I don't remember it!

01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:25.804
- We're gonna figure it out
in a couple of years anyway.

01:19:25.935 --> 01:19:27.458
- We're getting
close to the surface.

01:19:27.588 --> 01:19:28.764
- Good luck, Ramiro.

01:19:30.156 --> 01:19:30.809
Your extra genes and your
gizmos aren't gonna be

01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:33.594
of any use against
radiation sickness.

01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:36.554
- Give me something
to write with.

01:19:36.684 --> 01:19:37.773
Anything!

01:19:39.426 --> 01:19:41.994
[tense atmospheric music]

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.779
- [Carmen] You have 15 seconds.

01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:55.791
- There it is.

01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:57.270
Now hit the button.

01:19:57.401 --> 01:19:59.011
- Where's the second part?

01:19:59.142 --> 01:20:00.796
- What second part?

01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:01.971
- Nine.

01:20:02.101 --> 01:20:03.015
Eight.

01:20:03.146 --> 01:20:04.234
Seven.

01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:05.670
Six.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.193
Five.

01:20:07.237 --> 01:20:10.631
[tense music builds]

01:20:10.762 --> 01:20:12.024
- That's the full equation!

01:20:12.155 --> 01:20:14.287
Now hit the fucking button!

01:20:21.555 --> 01:20:25.211
[music intensifies]

01:20:25.255 --> 01:20:26.256

[door hisses open]

01:20:37.223 --> 01:20:38.616
- Stand down.

01:20:38.659 --> 01:20:42.533
[somber string music]

01:20:50.889 --> 01:20:52.021
What happened?

01:20:56.329 --> 01:20:58.027
- He set off his
suicide implant.

01:20:58.157 --> 01:21:01.465
Think his brain is fried but
you should probably check.

01:21:01.508 --> 01:21:03.684
Take a picture of that equation
and send it to Doctor Ellis

01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:05.948
at DARPA, he's expecting it.

01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:07.427
- Right away.

01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:08.951
Medic team to the airlock.

01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:10.300
Level one.

[birds chirping]

01:21:24.662 --> 01:21:26.272
[Jefferson sighs]

01:21:32.583 --> 01:21:35.281
- Everything was faked.

01:21:35.325 --> 01:21:37.240
- Except Jim, of course.

01:21:37.283 --> 01:21:39.285
- Newscasts.

01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:40.373
Messages.

01:21:41.374 --> 01:21:42.549
- Digital magic.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.160
Some play acting by real people.

01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:45.596
- Even the President?

01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:49.730
- [chuckles] He was
pretty good, wasn't he?

01:21:49.774 --> 01:21:52.124
- But we felt the explosions.

01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:54.953
- A few nukes detonated in
some surrounding mine shafts.

01:21:55.084 --> 01:21:58.043
A little bit risky
but effective.

01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:03.919
Jefferson.

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:07.400
That equation will let
us change everything.

01:22:15.756 --> 01:22:17.106
- Thank you.

01:22:29.857 --> 01:22:33.992
