00:22.256 --> 00:23.622
It's too late for me.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.191
You have to save the baby.
And find Anaya.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.127
[Anaya]<i> There's a lady</i>

00:28.129 --> 00:30.462

-Yeah.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.381

05:13.814 --> 05:15.180
Yes, I did. [sighs]

05:15.182 --> 05:17.983
But you haven't said much
since we got here.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.687
I can't help you
if you won't tell me--

05:21.689 --> 05:24.489
Is this about that boy,
Khalil?

05:26.093 --> 05:27.759
Sort of. [sighs]

05:27.761 --> 05:29.995

to be having this conversation
with your parents.

No, they wouldn't... [sighs]

05:32.666 --> 05:38.437
Well, they don't like Khalil,
okay? Or me very much
right now.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.639
And what makes you say that?

05:40.641 --> 05:43.475
Because they treat me
like some sort of prisoner,

05:43.477 --> 05:46.645
they don't even
let me leave the house.
[sighs]

05:46.647 --> 05:49.748
I think they're trying
to protect you.
What do you think?

05:50.651 --> 05:53.085
I think they look at me
and see failure.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.321
You are not a failure.

05:56.323 --> 05:59.024
No, they see themselves
as failures.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.861
My dad thinks it's his fault
I turned out weird.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.697
And I know he's trying
to protect me from living
some awful life,

06:05.699 --> 06:07.866
but he's so busy doing that...

06:07.868 --> 06:10.635
They both are,
they're not letting me
live at all.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.207
I don't know. Being locked up
in a room is definitely
not a life.

06:15.209 --> 06:20.579
It's like
I'm being punished for...
being born this way. [scoffs]

06:20.581 --> 06:24.082
Well, they don't mean
to punish you. They love you.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.552
Yeah, I know, I just don't
how much more of this kind
of love I can take.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.689
So I'm definitely not talking
to them about, you know who.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.091
'Cause they might send me
to nun school if I do that.

06:33.093 --> 06:37.295

Well, all I can say is that
if you care for Khalil,

06:37.297 --> 06:39.231
and he cares for you,
just be safe.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.300
Make sure you use condoms.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.570
What? No. Uh, well, yes,
I know that,

06:45.572 --> 06:48.106
but that's not the kind
of advice I was looking for.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.543
[sighs]
I just don't wanna hurt him.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.578

because they were worried

06:53.580 --> 06:55.881
I wouldn't be able
to control my powers.

06:55.883 --> 06:59.718
So what if I'm with him
and I shock him to death
or something?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.653
Is that what you're scared of?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.656
Yes. Well, that and...

07:04.658 --> 07:05.724
And?

07:08.262 --> 07:10.595

the rest of my life like this.

understands me.

not my parents,
not my sister, not--

07:21.708 --> 07:23.742
Not me?

07:23.744 --> 07:27.279
[sighs] Well, no,
I didn't mean it like that.
I just...

07:28.949 --> 07:31.883
I miss the way things
used to be
when I felt like me.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.186

I miss the way we used to be.

are never gonna be
the same again.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.318

We both make sacrifices

don't even know.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.262
And the thing I like about you
the most is that you fight
for your people.

08:50.264 --> 08:53.398
I fight for mine.
You're a proud

I'm a racist?

No, your T-shirt would say,
"I kill and hang Perdi

going on, I really haven't had

you can afford to eat caviar.

you just need to focus

Great. Then buy some time,
go back to Reverend Holt
and make him leave.

-I already tried--
-Do whatever it takes.
Try harder.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.484

Now, where am I gonna go?

Focus on Reverend Holt

19:33.473 --> 19:37.141
I can't figure it out,
but somehow
she can sense the baby.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.677
What do you mean,
"sense the baby"?

19:39.678 --> 19:42.212

<i> "sense" the baby</i>

I'll send your black ass

you understand me?

No, you're not listening
to me, Reverend.

is in God's hands, son.

come back so soon.

29:23.829 --> 29:25.863
I don't know what to say,
I don't know
what they think of me.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.698
Look, you can't focus on
what they think of you.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.333
Sometimes it's
just best to talk it out.

29:29.335 --> 29:32.936
But I crossed a line
I don't know if I can
redeem myself from.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.840
Look, I'll watch the babies,

29:36.842 --> 29:40.010
but I think they need you
more than your fear's
allowing you to see.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.981
Okay? You got it.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.682
[sighs]

30:12.344 --> 30:14.645
[sobbing] No.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.184
[sobbing]

30:20.186 --> 30:22.986
No. No.

30:33.566 --> 30:34.998
[Anaya sobbing]

30:44.877 --> 30:45.943
[baby cooing]

31:17.977 --> 31:19.176
[Anaya sobbing]

31:26.552 --> 31:28.485
[Anissa chuckles]

31:28.487 --> 31:30.687
[sighs] Joan is a wilding.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.789
[on TV]<i> Shouldn't you be</i>
<i>writing that down? 'Cause that</i>
<i> should be in the article.</i>

31:32.791 --> 31:35.192
-[Anissa laughs]
-[laughter on TV]

31:36.128 --> 31:37.327
[sighs]

31:41.400 --> 31:42.866
Hey, you okay?

31:44.136 --> 31:45.602
I'm fine.

31:45.604 --> 31:49.306
Well, I know you're fine.
[laughing]

31:51.343 --> 31:52.843
But are you okay?

31:52.845 --> 31:56.847
-You are so corny.
-Whatever. [chuckles]

31:56.849 --> 31:58.682
I gotta go to the bathroom.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.753
[knock at door]

33:14.059 --> 33:15.859
You look pretty good
for a dead guy.

33:20.366 --> 33:21.698
You gonna invite me in?

33:34.980 --> 33:36.246
[Gambi sighs]

33:38.484 --> 33:40.083
I believe this belongs to you.

33:43.589 --> 33:46.523
It's not like you to leave
a live transmitter
lying around.

33:46.525 --> 33:51.762
Uh... It must have jammed
when it crashed.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.897
[clicking]

33:58.237 --> 34:02.839
I don't know whether to
hug you or hit you, old man.

34:04.343 --> 34:08.445
If slugging me
will make you feel better,
you can.

34:14.853 --> 34:15.919
So?

34:18.223 --> 34:23.293
Someone tried
to assassinate me.
I still don't know who.

34:23.295 --> 34:26.696
It's better that they
still think that I'm dead,

34:26.698 --> 34:29.399
safer for your family
that I stay dead.

34:33.072 --> 34:38.108
You gotta know by now,
you are my family.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.082
-[sighs]
-[muffled grunt]

34:51.490 --> 34:53.290
I'm sorry, man.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.433
[sighs] These damn kids could
not turn these lights off.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.536
[Lynn] Hey.

35:10.542 --> 35:11.808
Jen?

35:17.249 --> 35:18.415
Jen?

35:25.090 --> 35:26.289
Jen?

35:35.767 --> 35:38.001
<i> -Hey, this is Jen,</i>
<i> leave a message.</i>
-[beep]

35:38.003 --> 35:42.172
Jen, it's Mom.
It's really late.
Where are you?

35:49.915 --> 35:51.848
Look, where is she?

35:51.850 --> 35:54.050
-I can't tell you that.
-Can't or won't?

35:54.052 --> 35:56.086
I can't violate the trust
of those who confide in me

35:56.088 --> 35:57.521
or my work would be
rendered useless.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.557
Listen, I may not have powers
like the rest of my family,

36:00.559 --> 36:02.859
but trust and believe
you do not want
to get on my bad side,

36:02.861 --> 36:04.661
especially when it comes
to my kids.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.497
So tell me where the hell
is my daughter!

36:07.499 --> 36:10.500
I don't know... exactly.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.469
What do you mean, "exactly"?

36:12.471 --> 36:15.305
Stop talking like
a damn oracle
and speak plain English.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.307
I'm saying
that I can't tell you
where your daughter is

36:17.309 --> 36:20.343
-'cause I don't know.
All I know is...
-[sighs]

36:22.681 --> 36:24.047
What?

36:24.683 --> 36:26.416
She's most likely with a boy.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.218
A boy? Wait, what boy?

36:28.220 --> 36:32.155
And I also know
that I've worked with many
with powers over the years,

36:32.157 --> 36:35.559
and I've never seen anyone
like Jennifer. She's special.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.260
Yeah, we, we know that.

36:37.262 --> 36:41.598
Do you? Jennifer's powers
are extraordinary,
and I don't say that lightly.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.166
She's just like her father.

36:43.168 --> 36:47.771
No, Jennifer's powers
are beyond anything
any of us have seen.

36:47.773 --> 36:50.574
Teaching her to control them
has been both a joy
and a challenge,

36:50.576 --> 36:53.743
because I've never worked
with anyone with gifts
like that.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.478
Which is why
I must caution you.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.965
What are you saying?

36:58.966 --> 37:01.483
I understand you're upset.
I understand you want
your daughter back.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.119
But you must be very careful.

37:04.556 --> 37:08.024
If you push her further away,
and she retreats
with her powers,

37:08.026 --> 37:11.795
with no real support system
and no guidance,

37:11.797 --> 37:14.598
there'll be consequences
for us all.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.533
["Loveeeee Song" playing]

37:22.774 --> 37:24.541
[sighs] How're you feelin'?

37:25.477 --> 37:29.646
[sighs] Tired. Tired, awful...

37:30.782 --> 37:33.149
[chuckles softly] And great.

37:34.486 --> 37:39.889
[chuckles softly]
Tired I understand.
Awful I get. But great?

37:39.891 --> 37:42.158
I feel great because
you saved my life.

37:43.228 --> 37:45.462
Everybody gave up on me,
except you.

37:47.299 --> 37:49.032
That's 'cause I know
the real you.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.569
And now you know the real me.

37:52.571 --> 37:57.374
You're the only person
that understands
what it's like to be...

37:57.376 --> 37:58.708
Like us.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.617
You know, after I got shot,

38:07.619 --> 38:11.521
my mom kept telling me
I could still have
a normal life.

38:13.325 --> 38:16.059
She didn't understand
that normal stopped
for me that day.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.063
Things are never gonna be
normal again.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.999
It's like how I went from

38:23.001 --> 38:26.603
being the Queen of Garfield
one day to some sort of
freak overnight.

38:27.606 --> 38:30.340
Yo, you're not a freak, Jen.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.412
[scoffs]
Man, you're beautiful.

38:36.782 --> 38:40.317
Khalil, I have light
shooting out of me.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.719
[Jen chuckles]

38:42.720 --> 38:45.120
That doesn't freak you out?
It freaks me out. Like,
be honest, it's weird.

38:45.123 --> 38:49.959
[chuckles] Okay.
Yeah, and I have metal

38:49.961 --> 38:52.762
all up in my back,
and poison in my veins.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.364
What, so you think
that makes me weird?

38:55.300 --> 38:56.366
No.

38:58.904 --> 39:02.672
Yeah.
That makes you weird.
[chuckles] Just a little bit.

39:02.674 --> 39:06.543
Okay, so, like, your parents,
they don't get it.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.545
That just means
they're not like you.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.552
Oh, wait, are they?

39:16.855 --> 39:18.388
-Are yours like you?
-Of course not.

39:18.390 --> 39:20.190
Are you sure? I'm not going
to have to worry
about your mom

39:20.192 --> 39:23.193
shooting darts my way,
or something. [chuckles]

39:23.195 --> 39:26.596
[chuckles softly] Okay.
All right, so...

39:26.598 --> 39:28.231
So what exactly can you do?

39:28.867 --> 39:30.433
Does it matter?

39:30.435 --> 39:32.569
Uh, yeah, it matters.
Look, I need to know
what I'm up against

39:32.571 --> 39:35.271
next time we get into a fight
because I forget your birthday

39:35.273 --> 39:38.108
or for checking out some girl.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.076
Okay, look,
you roll your eyes,
but I need to know,

39:40.078 --> 39:41.578
what, you gonna
electrocute me?

39:42.547 --> 39:45.181
I might. [chuckles]

39:45.851 --> 39:47.350
[chuckles] Damn!

40:03.535 --> 40:04.701
[gasps]

40:04.703 --> 40:07.170
[sighs] Damn! Do it again.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.638
[clicks tongue]
Khalil, that ain't funny.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.075
Hey, yo, I'm not laughing.
Yo, that kiss was fire.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.577
Oh, come on, it was just
a little bit funny.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.881
And just think it, I mean,
our kids, their powers
would be insane.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.350
-Okay, homie, you need
to slow your roll.
-[chuckles]

40:20.352 --> 40:21.751
You need to calm down.
[chuckles]

40:21.753 --> 40:25.488
Okay. Okay. You're right.
You're right. We'll go slow.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.659
[sighs]

40:29.660 --> 40:32.594
Hey. Being here with you
right now is enough for me.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.209
Are you sure you wanna leave?

40:46.945 --> 40:48.878
Yeah, let's go.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.177
[closing theme music playing]
