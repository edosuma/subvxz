11:01.000 --> 11:02.416
Nigga, where the drugs at?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.041
'Cause that powdered sugar you sold me
ain't hitting on shit.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.416
What we should be talking about
is a… a… a layaway plan,

11:09.500 --> 11:12.166
or a… a motherfucking,
uh, uh, carryover or something,

11:12.250 --> 11:14.500
'cause you…
you fucking with the wrong nigga here.

11:14.583 --> 11:15.666
You can always give it back.

11:17.041 --> 11:18.750
But-- [sighing]

11:18.833 --> 11:20.083
-Listen.
-[Fontaine] Move, bitch.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.250
This is what I was thinking.

11:21.333 --> 11:24.041
How about we just wipe the slate clean,
Fontaine? Know what I'm sayin'?

11:24.125 --> 11:25.875
And we both just grow, my nigga. Huh?

11:26.750 --> 11:29.708
Hey, hey. Listen, listen.
Fontaine, why don't you take a ho on me?

11:29.791 --> 11:30.875
You look stressed.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.875
I don't really appreciate
how you coming in here, you know,

11:33.958 --> 11:36.750
attacking my castle like that,
you know, in front of my flowers.

11:36.833 --> 11:41.458
You know what I'm saying, Fontaine?
Fontaine! Fontaine! Fontaine, goddamn it!

11:41.541 --> 11:44.708
I was a 1995 International Players Ball
"Pimp of the Year."

11:44.791 --> 11:46.625
Show me some motherfucking respect!

11:46.708 --> 11:48.000
Childhood-ass nigga!

11:51.375 --> 11:54.291
Fontaine. Listen, we ain't liquid
like we used to be, okay?

11:54.375 --> 11:55.541
Look, they dehydrated.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.750
These chickens ain't clucking
like they used to.

11:57.833 --> 11:58.833
It's a cold front.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.750
That's all my contingency right there.

12:02.833 --> 12:03.666
Okay?

12:04.166 --> 12:06.666
Fontaine, why don't you
just give me some more days, huh?

12:06.750 --> 12:07.708
You is a grinch!

12:09.583 --> 12:12.958
-We can settle up another way if you want.
-You think I'm scared of you, nigga?

12:14.916 --> 12:15.833
[exhales]

12:16.875 --> 12:19.958
Why does it always gotta be
Black-on-Black crime? Hmm?

12:21.916 --> 12:24.166
Black men are supposed
to support they niggas!

12:26.583 --> 12:30.250
Take your shit. Dramatic ass.
You're lucky I’m a lover, not a fighter.

12:31.791 --> 12:32.833
Bitch-ass nigga.

12:33.458 --> 12:34.583
Hmm? What'd you say?

12:36.125 --> 12:39.916
That's what I thought. Get out of here.
Wasting my motherfucking air.

12:47.125 --> 12:48.416
Y'all ain't shit.

15:34.291 --> 15:35.125
You playing?

15:35.208 --> 15:37.250

15:43.916 --> 15:47.291
Youngblood, straighter is greater,
you hear me?

15:48.500 --> 15:51.208
Straighter is motherfucking greater!

15:51.291 --> 15:52.916
-[Fontaine] Yeah, yeah.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.208
[woman on TV] …says wasn't nobody.
Just Reggie down at the job,

16:43.291 --> 16:47.208
but, Your Honor, I can tell he was lying.

16:47.291 --> 16:50.208
Don't no friend on the job make you
all smiley face in no text message.

16:50.291 --> 16:52.000
So, you know, I waited,

16:52.083 --> 16:54.916
and while this fool went to the bathroom,
he left his phone.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.916
Wanted to see it, so, okay,
I picked it up and went through it.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.500
Let me tell you something, Your Honor,
it wasn't no Reggie from the job.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.041
-[knocking on door]
-Mama.

17:04.583 --> 17:05.708
[knocking on door]

17:05.791 --> 17:07.208
You want something to eat?

I'm watching my stories.

[funk music playing]

17:28.916 --> 17:29.875
[sighs]

17:30.416 --> 17:34.666
2Clean Perm Cream.
Because straighter is greater.

17:34.750 --> 17:35.833
Watch my cuticle now.

17:36.958 --> 17:37.833
[Charles wincing]

17:38.875 --> 17:41.458
Be gentle with it. Respect it.
Respect that cuticle.

17:41.541 --> 17:42.708
[woman] Hmm.

17:42.791 --> 17:43.958
[banging on door]

17:44.041 --> 17:45.958
[funk music playing over radio]

17:46.041 --> 17:48.625
Shit.
Y'all bitches have somebody come over?

17:48.708 --> 17:49.583
[woman] Mm-mm.

18:01.083 --> 18:04.083
-Who that? Shit!
-[Fontaine] We gotta do this every time?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.291
-Open the damn door.
-Ain't no way. It ain't no way.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.541
Damn. It's Fontaine. Ain't no way, Jesus.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.708
Jesus, what're you doing?
You send a ghost to a pimp?

18:10.791 --> 18:12.708
-[Fontaine] I want my money, man.
-Ain't no way!

18:13.458 --> 18:16.125
-[Fontaine] You got five seconds. Five…
-How did this happen?

18:16.208 --> 18:19.583
There's gotta be a logical explanation
to this. Am I seeing shit?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.750
[Fontaine] Man, three,
I'mma bust your shit open.

18:22.833 --> 18:24.291
Man, open the damn door!

18:24.375 --> 18:25.291
[banging on door]

18:27.208 --> 18:28.333
You know why I'm here?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.500
[Charles shuddering]

18:31.583 --> 18:34.041
I think we got more pressing issues
to talk about.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.041
-And what's that?
-They shot your ass.

18:36.958 --> 18:37.958
Nigga, where the money at?

18:38.041 --> 18:40.708
Do you not remember
getting lit the fuck up?

18:40.791 --> 18:43.500
You should be breathing
through some tubes right now.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.083
-Look. I don't have time--
-You took it. Fontaine, you took it.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.416
You came in here,
you went through my haberdasheries.

18:49.500 --> 18:53.208
You passed up on my beige bitch,
and you went outside and pulled a 50 Cent.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.166
[Charles panting]

18:54.250 --> 18:57.250
-I told your ass if you wanna settle--
-We can settle it another way.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.791
Ain't no way. Shit.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.375
You Ghost of Christmas Past-ass nigga.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.791
What the fuck kind of shit
you playing on, huh?

19:03.875 --> 19:07.958
You done sold your soul to the devil.
I know what you did. I know what you did.

19:08.041 --> 19:11.166
If there ain't no juice in this
motherfucker, throw the damn bottle away!

19:13.916 --> 19:15.041
[whispering] Fontaine.

19:15.708 --> 19:17.958
I seen them niggas
shoot your ass six times.

19:18.041 --> 19:18.958
Mm-hmm.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.541
[Charles panting]

19:22.625 --> 19:24.000
You think I'm lying, nigga?

19:24.958 --> 19:28.458
You ask Yo-Yo. She took off on me
just before your ass got in here.

19:29.208 --> 19:32.250
Ask that trifling ass bitch
which one of us is crazy.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.166
[funky music playing]

19:34.250 --> 19:35.583
-Uh-uh.
-[man] Come on, baby.

19:35.666 --> 19:38.666
You ain’t getting no motherfucking
David Carradine for 50 bucks.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.625
Most I can do for you is a Susan Sarandon.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.458
-Let me get that.
-[Yo-Yo] Maybe a Shalamar.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.041
Nigga, you better get this good deal.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.750
My bad, Yo-Yo.
Need to steal you for a minute.

19:47.583 --> 19:49.125
[man] Don't you see we busy here?

19:49.208 --> 19:51.166
Don't you see
we'll split your wig down the middle

19:51.250 --> 19:53.125
and you'll be a half a nigga?

19:53.208 --> 19:57.083
Get your beige ass the fuck out of here.
You fake Obama-looking motherfucker.

19:57.166 --> 19:58.666
That ain't Michelle, nigga.

19:59.375 --> 20:00.750
Y'all owe me 50 dollars.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.458
I am retired.

20:02.541 --> 20:05.000
I just need some more dough
before I can get to Memphis.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.625
[Charles] There it is again,
that slippery slope of recidivism.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.666
-I hate to see it.
-When I'm there, I'mma find me a real man.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.500
Yeah, I'll find you a real man,
'cause I'm a real motherfucker.

20:13.583 --> 20:16.708
[Yo-Yo] Not some McDonald’s-dollar-menu
has-been-ass nigga in a Goodwill suit.

20:16.791 --> 20:19.541
Keep talking goddamnit,
and I'mma slip out of this Goodwill suit

20:19.625 --> 20:21.958
-and slap that fake-ass wig off…
-What the fuck did you--?

20:22.041 --> 20:23.750
…with nothing but my Gucci boxers on

20:23.833 --> 20:25.250
and be back in this coat
before it wrinkles.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.291
You know I can do it.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.500
[Yo-Yo] Oh, here you go
with this ninja pimp shit.

20:28.583 --> 20:29.583
Hey!

20:31.083 --> 20:33.583
I just need to clear something up
with you real quick.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.958
And you can be right back
on your merry hoeing way.

20:36.041 --> 20:37.000
Uh…

20:37.083 --> 20:37.958
Okay.

20:40.375 --> 20:41.750
You seen me last night?

20:41.833 --> 20:42.833
[Yo-Yo] Not like that.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.833
No. Like, literally.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.166
You seen me?

20:49.166 --> 20:50.625
Are you Kevin Bacon?

20:50.708 --> 20:51.875
Wait. What?

20:51.958 --> 20:54.166
Hollow Man. [chuckling]

20:54.875 --> 20:58.166
-That was a good one. You liked it.
-Good movie. Good movie. Yeah.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.333
And I picked that one. You… mm-hmm. Okay.

21:00.958 --> 21:02.291
Yes, nigga. I saw you.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.958
You heard them shots after?

21:04.458 --> 21:07.583
I mean, I got ears, don’t I?
Somebody was letting them bitches loose.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.666
To be honest, I thought it was you
doing me a favor.

21:10.750 --> 21:11.791
Yo-Yo.

21:11.875 --> 21:14.000
So, what you tryin' to say?
You ain't seen nothin'?

21:14.083 --> 21:16.083
I mean,
I didn't say all of that. [scoffing]

21:16.166 --> 21:18.625
You know your girl gotta know
what’s going on in these streets.

21:18.708 --> 21:21.916
So, yeah.
I doubled back after a cool little minute.

21:22.958 --> 21:25.000
I think I saw the perpetrators leaving.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.583
-[Charles] I told you.
-[Yo-Yo grunting]

21:27.583 --> 21:28.625
Well, and?

21:28.708 --> 21:29.666
[Yo-Yo scoffing]

21:30.875 --> 21:35.208
Yeah. I recognize the whip,
'cause I do house calls over on Second.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.333
Hold on. I ain't sanctioned that shit.

21:37.416 --> 21:40.250
Sometimes, I see the car parked
a few driveways down.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.041
So, yeah. It looked mad familiar.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.250
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-[car engine starting]

21:47.333 --> 21:50.625
[scoffing] I'm done. You said I could go
on my merry hoeing way.

21:50.708 --> 21:54.375
[DJ] It's your boy, DJ Strangelove.
I know it's been a long day.

21:54.458 --> 21:57.625
I know you need that tall glass of wine.
I got that new Ruckus,

21:57.708 --> 21:59.166
"So Tired."

21:59.250 --> 22:01.125
Damn, I hate this motherfucking song.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.750
["So Tired" by Twelve'len playing]

22:02.833 --> 22:05.291
Fontaine, can you change
this depressing-ass shit?

22:06.250 --> 22:08.083
Every time this song come on, I get…

22:08.583 --> 22:10.000
[yawning] …sleepy as hell.

22:10.083 --> 22:11.625
[all yawning]

22:15.083 --> 22:19.000
Mm. The house coming up on the left
over here. Oh, that's the car right there.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.583
What the hell you looking at?
That ain’t the car.

22:21.666 --> 22:23.750
-That is the car.
-Yo-Yo, that ain't the car.

22:23.833 --> 22:26.250
-I know what I saw. Don't tell me--
-Wait a minute.

22:26.833 --> 22:28.333
[Fontaine] I know that car.

22:28.416 --> 22:30.083
[Charles] What you talking about?

22:30.166 --> 22:33.375
[Fontaine] I saw it earlier the other day
at the liquor store.

22:33.458 --> 22:36.166
[Charles] So? Every rapper
and ball player, they all drive that shit.

22:36.250 --> 22:38.250
-[car engine turns off]
-[keys jangling]

22:41.541 --> 22:43.125
[Charles] Oh, goddamn it.

22:43.208 --> 22:46.083
You know what, Fontaine? You got this,
uh, Rambo-esque look about you.

22:46.166 --> 22:50.500
So I'mma let you go and do your thing,
and I'mma just sit right here in the car.

22:51.916 --> 22:53.916
Fresh air might be good
for a nigga, though.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.291
[funky music playing]

23:01.083 --> 23:03.625
[Yo-Yo] Man,
I ain't with this X-Files shit.

23:03.708 --> 23:06.916
[Charles] Fontaine, this ain't no pimpin'.
There ain't nothing pimp about this.

01:24:59.041 --> 01:25:00.666
Then she dipped off
with one of them johns.

01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:03.291
Maybe a rapper or a ballplayer, I surmise.

-What you got in mind?
-That's what we gonna do.

[alarm blaring]

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:44.625
[announcer] Please remain calm

01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:47.458
and find your way
to the nearest egress point.

01:39:04.083 --> 01:39:07.791
You was the 1995 International
Players Ball Pimp of the Year.

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.541
-[computer beeping]
-[air hissing]

01:39:09.625 --> 01:39:11.541
Come on. Hey, hey.
Get your ass up out of here.

01:39:11.625 --> 01:39:13.291
There you go.
Put a little pep in your step.

01:39:13.375 --> 01:39:14.708
-[gun firing]
-Oh shit!

01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:16.750
[tense music playing]

01:39:16.833 --> 01:39:18.666
-[whispering] Fuck.
-[man] You know what?

01:39:19.166 --> 01:39:20.750
This is my fault.

01:39:21.333 --> 01:39:22.958
I should've killed you the first time.

01:39:25.333 --> 01:39:26.250
[gun firing]

01:39:26.333 --> 01:39:28.666
[man] Hell, I should've killed you
the second time.

01:39:30.708 --> 01:39:32.416
[Fontaine groaning]

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.291
[man] Yeah, no.
The east wing is compromised,

01:39:52.375 --> 01:39:55.000
but our department
has taken minimal losses, sir.

01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:00.500
Yes, sir.

01:40:01.916 --> 01:40:02.750
Of course.

01:40:03.708 --> 01:40:04.625
[receiver clicks]

01:40:08.916 --> 01:40:10.541
After all these years…

01:40:12.708 --> 01:40:15.291
still so strange.

01:40:20.416 --> 01:40:21.916
Good to see you, Fontaine.

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.583
-Flank around.
-[man] My wife says I'm getting soft.

01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:26.916
[mouthing] Come to you?

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:28.583
[man] Hell… [chuckling]

01:40:28.666 --> 01:40:30.875
[whispering] No, nigga.
Go the fuck around.

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:33.166
[man] A few too many mea culpas
these days.

01:40:34.125 --> 01:40:36.541
Me, I try to find
the brighter side of things.

01:40:37.375 --> 01:40:40.708
Learning from our mistakes,
well, that's how we grow.

01:40:40.791 --> 01:40:42.375
[screaming] Shit.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.375
[man] Maybe when this is over,
I'll have the boys come down

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:49.541
and scrape up some of your cells,
grow me a secretary.

01:40:49.625 --> 01:40:50.833
[Yo-Yo] Well, you know what?

01:40:50.916 --> 01:40:53.291
I might have
a few complaints to file with HR

01:40:53.375 --> 01:40:55.750
about the working conditions
in this bitch.

01:40:55.833 --> 01:40:59.250
[man] Speaking of Human Resources,
where are your friends?

01:40:59.333 --> 01:41:01.375
Fucking up your shit as we speak.

01:41:01.958 --> 01:41:04.500
Well, one problem at a time.

01:41:05.875 --> 01:41:07.041
[ominous music playing]

01:41:07.125 --> 01:41:08.125
You're

01:41:09.083 --> 01:41:09.916
me.

01:41:11.125 --> 01:41:11.958
No.

01:41:13.125 --> 01:41:14.500
You're me.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.625
One of the many
I've had to create over the years.

01:41:18.208 --> 01:41:21.000
So, what, you… you working for them?

01:41:21.833 --> 01:41:25.791
Let's just call it
a marriage of convenience.

01:41:26.875 --> 01:41:29.625
I'm the lead geneticist of this operation.

01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:32.041
But… but why?

01:41:34.541 --> 01:41:35.416
Ronnie.

01:41:37.208 --> 01:41:38.083
Ronnie,

01:41:39.166 --> 01:41:40.000
is he--

01:41:40.083 --> 01:41:40.958
No, no.

01:41:41.958 --> 01:41:42.791
He died

01:41:43.666 --> 01:41:45.458
just the way you remember.

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.000
It's the one thing
I wanted you all to have.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:53.083
But yes, he is the reason
I made a deal with the devil.

01:41:53.583 --> 01:41:54.416
[gun firing]

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:57.708
[man] A lot of paperwork, Yo-Yo.
You know I hate paperwork.

01:41:57.791 --> 01:41:59.625
-[Yo-Yo] Fuck paperwork!
-[whispering] Patience.

01:41:59.708 --> 01:42:02.125
-[Yo-Yo] I hope you get buried in it!
-Pimp hand raised.

01:42:02.208 --> 01:42:04.041
-[man chuckling] Well, that's funny.
-Ready.

01:42:04.125 --> 01:42:05.125
[gun clicking]

01:42:05.208 --> 01:42:06.416
What the fuck?

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:07.666
[gun firing]

01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:08.583
Shit.

01:42:08.666 --> 01:42:11.125
[man] You know,
we got operations everywhere.

01:42:11.666 --> 01:42:14.083
-Los Angeles, Chicago.
-Fuck.

01:42:14.166 --> 01:42:15.416
-[Charles grunting]
-[gun firing]

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:18.500
[man] But I picked the Glen
because it was supposed to be quiet.

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:21.250
Well, here you are causing a racket.

01:42:22.041 --> 01:42:25.541
You see, Fontaine,
the… the powers that be,

01:42:25.625 --> 01:42:29.083
the invisible people above me
who pull the strings,

01:42:29.166 --> 01:42:31.166
weren't getting the results they wanted.

01:42:31.708 --> 01:42:33.833
Years of experimentation.

01:42:33.916 --> 01:42:37.875
Billions of dollars spent,
yet no true peace in America.

01:42:39.208 --> 01:42:40.541
Hair products,

01:42:41.791 --> 01:42:44.291
songs on the radio, fried chicken.

01:42:46.166 --> 01:42:49.250
Clones maintaining the charade.

01:42:51.375 --> 01:42:54.458
Short-sighted, waste of resources.

01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:58.750
All because they couldn't see
what's so obvious to you and me.

01:43:00.083 --> 01:43:02.000
It's not enough to think the same,

01:43:03.333 --> 01:43:05.625
we have to be the same.

01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:08.250
Nah. You tripping, man.

01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:13.916
My work in the Cloning Initiative
helped me track down 378 unique genes

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.416
that separate you and your ghettos

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:21.875
from your counterparts
in the suburbs, the barrios…

01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:25.041
Chinatown.

01:43:25.958 --> 01:43:27.625
Once I sequenced them all,

01:43:27.708 --> 01:43:30.875
I approached my superiors
with an addendum,

01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:34.666
and I'm sure you're aware
of our first test subjects.

01:43:36.708 --> 01:43:37.708
In the lab,

01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:39.666
the tech,

01:43:40.625 --> 01:43:41.541
the manager.

01:43:41.625 --> 01:43:45.041
Not complete successes, but they pass.

01:43:46.125 --> 01:43:47.125
It's the hair.

01:43:47.208 --> 01:43:50.125
It's stubborn.

01:43:51.333 --> 01:43:53.666
But we have since perfected the process.

01:43:54.166 --> 01:43:55.541
I think niggas might notice

01:43:55.625 --> 01:43:58.666
if they wake up one morning
with blond hair and blue eyes.

01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:01.500
This won't happen overnight, Fontaine.

01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:05.791
It'll happen over generations.

01:44:07.125 --> 01:44:12.541
And now we are at the precipice
of our true national rollout.

01:44:13.583 --> 01:44:14.833
[ominous music playing]

01:44:14.916 --> 01:44:16.916
[eerie vocalizing]

01:44:19.916 --> 01:44:23.375
Assimilation is better than annihilation.

01:44:25.666 --> 01:44:26.666
[Yo-Yo] Shit.

01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:29.166
[man] Come on, Yo-Yo.
How about we wrap this up?

01:44:31.458 --> 01:44:32.875
[man grunting]

01:44:32.958 --> 01:44:33.791
Shit.

01:44:34.875 --> 01:44:38.541
[man] Krav Maga, Tuesdays and Thursdays.
How're you feeling, Slick Charles?

01:44:38.625 --> 01:44:40.291
-[Charles groans]
-Hey, motherfucker!

01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:41.708
[Fontaine breathing heavily]

01:44:41.791 --> 01:44:43.750
You think Ronnie would want this?

01:44:43.833 --> 01:44:45.000
[Old Fontaine scoffing]

01:44:47.958 --> 01:44:52.125
Don't presume because I gave you
a few memories you know my brother.

01:44:53.125 --> 01:44:54.833
You weren't really there that day

01:44:55.958 --> 01:44:57.083
when he died.

01:44:57.708 --> 01:44:59.833
[man] Come on out, now. Don't be shy.

01:44:59.916 --> 01:45:01.041
[gun cocking]

01:45:01.583 --> 01:45:02.583
[man] Come on, now.

01:45:12.375 --> 01:45:14.208
You see, Fontaine, he was shot.

01:45:15.791 --> 01:45:16.666
Violently.

01:45:18.125 --> 01:45:19.000
Right here.

01:45:19.625 --> 01:45:20.625
[Fontaine groaning]

01:45:20.708 --> 01:45:23.375
[Old Fontaine]
Between interior ribs five and six.

01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:25.208
Missed the heart.

01:45:26.083 --> 01:45:27.291
Pierced the lungs.

01:45:29.083 --> 01:45:30.666
That didn't have to be fatal.

01:45:33.083 --> 01:45:34.250
They left him there

01:45:35.708 --> 01:45:38.500
alone, scared,

01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:41.916
laid out on the cold concrete.

01:45:44.375 --> 01:45:46.375
Took him 15 minutes to die.

01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.875
[man] Why don't you toss
that peashooter over to me?

01:45:51.916 --> 01:45:52.916
Now!

01:45:54.916 --> 01:45:56.000
[gun clatters]

01:45:57.166 --> 01:45:58.000
Cute.

01:45:58.625 --> 01:46:01.208
You know, when I arrived at the morgue…

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:05.666
I just stood over him

01:46:07.333 --> 01:46:08.500
for a long time.

01:46:10.583 --> 01:46:13.125
I… I knew it was him. I just--

01:46:16.375 --> 01:46:19.083
They couldn't be bothered
to clean all the blood.

01:46:21.375 --> 01:46:23.541
And by that time, it had dried up…

01:46:25.791 --> 01:46:27.000
crusted black.

01:46:29.208 --> 01:46:30.125
So I…

01:46:31.458 --> 01:46:32.458
found a rag…

01:46:34.666 --> 01:46:36.333
and I cleaned it myself.

01:46:38.583 --> 01:46:40.250
I washed his skin.

01:46:44.125 --> 01:46:46.250
I spared you from that memory.

01:46:48.708 --> 01:46:51.291
I'mma go back to my fucking track.
You don't gotta worry about me.

01:46:51.375 --> 01:46:52.416
We'll get out of your hair.

01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:54.208
I never could understand
what you saw in him.

01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:57.791
I mean,
I don't want to kick a man when he's down,

01:46:57.875 --> 01:46:58.833
but he's an idiot.

01:46:59.625 --> 01:47:02.750
Well, I guess you could say
he's got a flair for the dramatic.

01:47:04.333 --> 01:47:05.625
He's Slick.

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:11.375
I… I know you think
you did something important here today,

01:47:12.166 --> 01:47:14.791
but what happened to Ronnie
can never happen again.

01:47:15.375 --> 01:47:17.875
So my work will continue all the same.

01:47:19.708 --> 01:47:20.625
It must.

01:47:21.708 --> 01:47:23.333
We all have a part to play.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.958
I have mine. You had yours.

01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:33.000
Wish we could do this forever,
but it's been a really long day.

01:47:33.083 --> 01:47:34.458
-You take care--
-And he got style.

01:47:34.541 --> 01:47:36.875
[stuttering] Nigga got style.

01:47:36.958 --> 01:47:39.208
Slick, I know
I talk a lot of motherfucking shit,

01:47:39.291 --> 01:47:41.208
but that's just a manifestation
of my frustration.

01:47:41.291 --> 01:47:42.625
I mean, look at this motherfucker.

01:47:43.666 --> 01:47:45.333
I can't let you do this.

01:47:45.958 --> 01:47:47.666
[Old Fontaine]
Oh, I wish I didn't have to.

01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:49.041
[ominous music swelling]

Olympia Black.

01:47:52.875 --> 01:47:54.416
[Yo-Yo] He look good, don't he?

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.458
From the alligators to the furs,

01:47:58.083 --> 01:48:01.666
the leather to the gold chains.

01:48:05.625 --> 01:48:07.125
And the motherfucking rings.

01:48:07.833 --> 01:48:09.291
Olympia Black.

01:48:09.375 --> 01:48:11.208
[Fontaine straining] Olympia Black.

01:48:11.291 --> 01:48:13.291
I am not a clone.

01:48:13.916 --> 01:48:14.833
No.

01:48:15.541 --> 01:48:16.666
He is.

01:48:17.541 --> 01:48:19.000
-Shoot him.
-[Old Fontaine] Wait--

01:48:22.625 --> 01:48:24.375
[Old Fontaine coughing]

01:48:24.458 --> 01:48:27.750
Ooh, you was taking
your precious-ass time. Damn.

01:48:28.708 --> 01:48:31.000
That Goodwill suit
ain't so bad now, is it?

01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:33.333
I was acting, motherfucker.

01:48:33.416 --> 01:48:35.041
[funky music playing]

01:48:41.458 --> 01:48:43.291
[Fontaine groaning]

[news theme music playing]

01:49:04.916 --> 01:49:09.333
Donna Kelley here reporting live
from an absolutely outrageous scene.

01:49:09.416 --> 01:49:11.250
I'm here at the Check Cashing Place

01:49:11.333 --> 01:49:15.833
where dozens of confused,
mostly naked people have emerged.

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:19.291
911 operators have been inundated
with hundreds--

01:49:20.333 --> 01:49:24.458
[reporter 2] What's amazing is how quickly
residents of the Glen have rallied help.

01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:29.000
We've got folks out here giving out water,
food, clothes off their own backs.

01:49:29.083 --> 01:49:30.125
In fact,

01:49:30.208 --> 01:49:34.083
I have some fellows who claim
to have been the center of all the action.

01:49:34.166 --> 01:49:36.708
Sir, could you tell us
what the heck is going on?

01:49:36.791 --> 01:49:38.458
-[man] A whole lot of gang shit.
-Shit.

01:49:38.541 --> 01:49:40.958
You know, boys had to click up,
storm the castle.

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:43.875
