00:03.499 --> 00:06.229
Hey! Mrs. Li, Hurry!

00:06.468 --> 00:10.029
Turn on the TV! Channel 2
is rerunning your series!

00:19.515 --> 00:22.712
"Heard you have a crush on
the baby face next door"

00:22.885 --> 00:24.546
"No... "

00:24.753 --> 00:26.618
- "You sure?" - "No... "

00:26.922 --> 00:28.116
"The one you said looks like Alan Tam"

00:29.525 --> 00:31.891
"I never said so!"

00:32.060 --> 00:34.221
Mrs. Li, you crying?

00:35.030 --> 00:37.863
Don't be sad; be strong

00:38.100 --> 00:40.125
Good night, Mrs. Li

01:23.979 --> 01:26.971
Headaches? And rashes?

01:27.282 --> 01:30.945
It's just nerves! You should be happy instead!

01:31.219 --> 01:35.087
You're 2 months pregnant! We've confirmed it

01:36.692 --> 01:38.853
- You sure? -Absolutely

01:39.528 --> 01:42.019
Peter, you told me I couldn't conceive!

01:42.164 --> 01:44.997
Not anymore! Now you can!

01:45.100 --> 01:47.534
- You sure there's no mistake
- Not a chance

01:47.803 --> 01:52.331
This is the best news for both Mr Li and you!

01:52.507 --> 01:54.941
I'll prescribe something to ease your tension

01:55.143 --> 01:58.340
You'll be fine in a couple of days

02:04.486 --> 02:06.784
- Nurse - Yes, Dr. Wong

02:06.989 --> 02:10.116
Mrs. Li's chauffeur will come
pick up her medication

02:11.093 --> 02:12.082
How many days' prescription?

02:12.294 --> 02:15.388
- Give her a week's worth - Okay

02:41.456 --> 02:42.445
Don't move!

02:46.094 --> 02:48.654
Dispatch, we've arrived at 2103

02:49.297 --> 02:52.858
Victim is male, badly cut;
we need an ambulance

02:53.769 --> 02:56.897
We have his wife under control

03:13.889 --> 03:14.913
Tell them to hurry

03:15.457 --> 03:18.722
The victim is alive, please hurry!

03:50.058 --> 03:51.491
So much stuff left

03:53.562 --> 03:56.554
What are these... so well-hidden?

04:35.103 --> 04:38.903
Shenzhen, China

04:42.443 --> 04:47.005
CUT

05:43.471 --> 05:45.234
Hello?

05:46.941 --> 05:48.602
Just a minute

05:51.045 --> 05:52.774
There, alright

05:53.614 --> 05:58.176
No, I'm not busy... I was just having dinner

05:59.220 --> 06:01.120
Have you eaten?

06:02.089 --> 06:04.353
I can't finish it

06:06.060 --> 06:08.187
Yeah, I've left it frozen

06:11.299 --> 06:14.393
My stomach doesn't feel so good

06:16.771 --> 06:18.295
Anyway...

06:18.506 --> 06:23.102
It's been 3 months since I moved here,
aren't you going to come over?

06:23.311 --> 06:24.801
How about tomorrow?

06:25.112 --> 06:27.376
We can have breakfast together...

06:27.848 --> 06:30.339
...if you don't mind cold leftovers

06:34.522 --> 06:36.786
You really want to hear me play?

07:05.119 --> 07:06.950
My stomach is really bothering me!

07:07.655 --> 07:09.418
I feel nauseous!

07:11.058 --> 07:13.925
Perhaps the food is past its expiration date

07:24.171 --> 07:28.471
Darling, it's killing me!

08:16.090 --> 08:18.115
And...

08:22.563 --> 08:23.530
What's scene 29 again?

08:23.764 --> 08:25.595
- Good-bye, sir -Good-bye!

08:25.933 --> 08:28.163
Scene 29 is where Young-Chae
draws blood with a water pump

08:28.369 --> 08:29.336
Right...

08:29.670 --> 08:31.831
- Good-bye, sir! -Good-bye!

08:33.640 --> 08:37.770
If we push it back to the 13th...

08:37.912 --> 08:40.813
Shoot the remaining inserts
during the morning of the 8th...

08:41.048 --> 08:43.914
...and I'll finish editing before the night shoot

08:44.217 --> 08:46.243
Then the crew can catch
some sleep in between

08:46.420 --> 08:48.911
But you won't get any sleep at all!

08:49.156 --> 08:51.056
Better just one, than all sixty
of the crew losing sleep

08:51.659 --> 08:52.853
Quite true

08:53.294 --> 08:55.387
- Take care, sir! -Yeah, you too!

08:56.564 --> 08:58.498
Kyung-ah, get the guys to do the heavy work!

08:59.166 --> 09:00.599
I heard you're going to Seoul

09:00.868 --> 09:02.529
- Could you drop me off at Hanam City?

09:02.803 --> 09:03.462
- Good-bye, sir!

09:03.704 --> 09:04.295
- Good-bye!

09:04.605 --> 09:05.094
- Good-bye, sir!

09:05.139 --> 09:05.867
- Good-bye!

09:06.140 --> 09:07.607
Sir... the daggers we talked about

09:07.875 --> 09:08.899
Good work!

09:10.845 --> 09:13.575
Good work everyone!

09:16.984 --> 09:21.216
I ran over from Studio 3 as
soon as I heard you're here

09:21.689 --> 09:24.715
Did you read the scripts I sent you?

09:25.126 --> 09:27.594
What do you think? Which one should I do?

09:27.762 --> 09:30.196
"Pink Panty", go for "Pink Panty"

09:30.498 --> 09:32.489
They say director Jang is
the John Waters of Korea

09:32.666 --> 09:35.328
Still... don't you think his film is a little sinister?

09:35.669 --> 09:40.072
- Kim Chang's film seems better
- Director Kim Chang...

09:40.441 --> 09:43.308
His film only makes the director look good

09:43.477 --> 09:45.672
The actors don't get noticed at all

09:46.547 --> 09:49.209
Just don't waste your time on him

09:49.650 --> 09:51.481
What about this...

09:51.685 --> 09:54.085
Trying something other than Mr. Nice Guy?

09:54.255 --> 09:56.382
Like a psycho-rapist-killer thing... huh?!

09:58.759 --> 09:59.589
Huh?!

10:00.461 --> 10:04.397
Don't worry, I ate already...
Just go back to your work

10:05.032 --> 10:07.193
We can have breakfast together tomorrow

10:07.368 --> 10:10.201
I'll take care of it if you
don't mind cold leftovers

10:11.505 --> 10:13.473
You should have come to see the set!

10:13.741 --> 10:15.504
It looks just like our house...

10:15.709 --> 10:18.906
Hey, I got the music for the film! Listen to this...

11:46.100 --> 11:48.568
The rehearsal will end late!
Don't forget your veggie diet!

13:45.552 --> 13:47.042
You've got...

13:48.889 --> 13:51.756
...such pretty hands, ma'am

13:58.766 --> 14:01.326
There's jewelry in the bedroom!

14:01.468 --> 14:03.993
Take it all! Just don't hurt anyone!

14:04.271 --> 14:05.533
Please, let us go!

14:17.084 --> 14:18.949
Darn...

14:19.386 --> 14:23.823
You're not supposed to start
off with this kind of talk!

14:24.058 --> 14:29.428
You shouldn't have started begging
until... like 20 minutes later

14:29.830 --> 14:34.324
"Wait"... till things fall apart first!

14:34.501 --> 14:37.061
You are, after all, the head of the house

14:37.438 --> 14:45.709
If you're only capable of "begging"
from the onset...

14:46.013 --> 14:49.380
...who else could your wife count on?

14:51.819 --> 14:57.883
Remember what happened when you
shot "Uninvited Guest" in 1998?

14:58.158 --> 15:03.095
When those gangsters
busted in on the shoot...

15:04.898 --> 15:06.297
"Stop it!"

15:06.667 --> 15:08.225
You shouted at them boldly!

15:08.569 --> 15:10.594
What happened to your guts now?

15:12.072 --> 15:13.562
Who are you?

15:13.774 --> 15:14.763
Who, me?

15:16.210 --> 15:18.770
Maybe you'll recognize me like this...

15:36.130 --> 15:37.461
Nope?

15:40.834 --> 15:43.302
Red Hunt! Huh?

16:07.127 --> 16:08.219
Water!

16:11.098 --> 16:12.429
Water!

16:14.535 --> 16:17.231
Water...

16:19.640 --> 16:21.608
What the hell!

16:23.343 --> 16:24.901
Ready, huh?!

16:25.045 --> 16:26.569
Action, huh?

16:29.883 --> 16:32.010
And... CUT!

16:48.669 --> 16:50.660
She's a pianist...

16:50.804 --> 16:54.501
I know that of course! I've done my research

16:55.075 --> 16:58.511
Got to be the pianist's fingers
for the "cut" to mean something

16:58.745 --> 17:03.478
Only an idiot would want her toes instead!

17:03.684 --> 17:05.549
Honey!

17:05.886 --> 17:09.583
Honey, I'll... take care of this somehow

17:09.890 --> 17:12.983
Honey, are you alright? It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

17:13.292 --> 17:15.989
I still don't know what's going on...

17:16.663 --> 17:19.530
But I'm sure... we can get out of this somehow

17:19.766 --> 17:21.097
Just trust me, okay?

17:22.269 --> 17:23.792
Does it hurt a lot, honey?

17:23.936 --> 17:26.872
Try and bear it a little longer!
Do that for me, okay?

17:27.074 --> 17:28.405
It will be all over soon

17:29.576 --> 17:33.910
I'll... I'll make sure you can play again

17:34.081 --> 17:36.413
I love you, honey

17:36.850 --> 17:39.478
Let's be strong

17:39.920 --> 17:42.616
One way or another, I'll...

17:49.663 --> 17:51.096
I remember you now!

17:51.598 --> 17:52.360
Yeah?

17:54.468 --> 17:55.457
An Extra

17:58.605 --> 18:03.633
I was in all five of your films, sir!

18:05.412 --> 18:08.279
You were such a kind man...

18:08.482 --> 18:12.077
...unlike any other directors
I've ever worked with

18:12.352 --> 18:16.049
So kind, no matter what mistakes I made

18:16.256 --> 18:22.718
Remember the mob scene in "The Desert"?

18:22.930 --> 18:26.161
You were shooting the crowd
running in the distance

18:26.366 --> 18:28.994
Some moron knocked over
a hornet's nest as we ran

18:29.269 --> 18:32.864
I got stung, I freaked out and I ruined the take

18:33.473 --> 18:34.497
Naturally...

18:34.808 --> 18:38.209
The damn assistant director gave me hell

18:38.412 --> 18:39.811
But then you said...

18:40.013 --> 18:43.710
How about using the time to set up
another take instead of yelling?

18:43.884 --> 18:45.818
It's not like he wanted to get stung

18:47.587 --> 18:48.986
Is your neck okay?

19:01.034 --> 19:02.524
You were so sweet

19:02.669 --> 19:07.436
But what's the use of all that?

19:09.109 --> 19:11.839
You don't even recognize me!

19:12.312 --> 19:13.745
Why are you doing this to me?

19:13.914 --> 19:16.075
What do you mean "Why"?

19:16.416 --> 19:20.147
"Because" this world is so fucked up!
That's why!

19:20.654 --> 19:22.918
Look at this, look!

19:23.123 --> 19:26.149
I didn't even know there are
houses like this in Korea!

19:26.293 --> 19:29.626
Lots of people are better off
than us! This house is merely...

19:31.798 --> 19:34.266
The rich people I've ever met...

19:34.534 --> 19:37.867
They're all scumbags, no respect for people

19:38.405 --> 19:42.671
I don't even consider them as human beings

19:44.544 --> 19:49.243
But you, you are a good man!

19:50.384 --> 19:54.821
That's so fucking unfair!

19:55.155 --> 19:58.522
You're rich, handsome, educated in America...

19:58.725 --> 20:00.955
...a genius director, and
you have a pretty wife!

20:01.228 --> 20:04.061
If you're also a "good" man on top of that...

20:04.297 --> 20:07.994
...what are guys like me supposed to get?!

20:10.003 --> 20:11.698
You know on TV shows...

20:11.872 --> 20:14.568
Only the poor folks are good people!
Never the rich!

20:14.908 --> 20:16.432
You've already got everything!

20:16.710 --> 20:19.577
Why do you have to corner us too?!

20:19.880 --> 20:22.474
Why are you a good man, too?

20:22.649 --> 20:26.415
You live well in this world and
you'll live well in heaven

20:26.653 --> 20:30.248
Our lives suck and we're going to hell!

20:30.524 --> 20:35.291
This is totally outrageous!

20:35.529 --> 20:36.996
That's not true

20:37.330 --> 20:39.457
"It's harder for a rich man to get into heaven... "

20:39.566 --> 20:42.694
"... than a camel to go through
the eye of a needle"

20:42.969 --> 20:43.697
It's in the Bible!

20:43.970 --> 20:45.631
Bull shit

20:47.040 --> 20:49.736
It's easier for a rich man to get into heaven...

20:50.243 --> 20:54.043
...than putting a needle into a camel's nostril!

20:55.749 --> 20:59.276
Face it, you've got no cause to sin

20:59.453 --> 21:00.977
Of course I have

21:01.288 --> 21:04.655
Then, prove it!

21:10.097 --> 21:11.291
What persistence

21:11.498 --> 21:12.692
I'm sorry...

21:26.146 --> 21:28.205
- ... for being a good person -Look at that!

21:28.381 --> 21:29.871
Look!

21:30.183 --> 21:32.617
What a good man?!

21:48.468 --> 21:51.494
I can let your wife go

21:51.872 --> 21:54.306
On one condition...

21:54.574 --> 21:57.566
You have to kill someone right here!
Can you do that?

22:07.053 --> 22:09.044
I'll do as you wish

22:09.389 --> 22:11.687
Let her go and I'll die in her place

22:59.706 --> 23:01.765
You don't need to die

23:02.075 --> 23:04.168
You just need to strangle
the little kid over there

23:04.344 --> 23:07.142
If you don't, in every five minutes...

23:07.414 --> 23:09.678
...I'll cut off another one of your wife's fingers

23:09.883 --> 23:13.114
Let's see how good you can stay!

23:16.356 --> 23:17.687
Ready...

23:18.191 --> 23:18.782
Go!

23:18.992 --> 23:20.323
Who is this kid?

23:20.493 --> 23:21.926
I don't know her either!

23:22.062 --> 23:24.963
Met her on my way here!
She looked bored so I brought her along

23:52.259 --> 23:54.159
Guess what

23:54.628 --> 23:59.224
I've been dirt poor ever since I was a kid

23:59.799 --> 24:05.203
My bastard father was always dead drunk

24:05.372 --> 24:09.308
He beat the hell out of us day in and day out

24:09.709 --> 24:15.170
Needless to say my grades were bad

24:15.548 --> 24:21.680
And this ugly face of mine could
get me nowhere near stardom

24:21.955 --> 24:25.413
So you see, now I'm the one
who always gets drunk

24:25.659 --> 24:30.096
I go home and I kick my boy's ass

24:30.330 --> 24:34.790
And, I beat my wife, too!

24:35.168 --> 24:37.329
When I sober up in the morning...

24:37.704 --> 24:40.104
...and see that beat-up face of hers

24:40.440 --> 24:43.000
Guess what I think of?

24:43.310 --> 24:45.710
Your face!

24:46.246 --> 24:51.980
Your nice handsome face overlapping hers...

24:52.152 --> 24:56.486
It makes perfect sense for a poor
kid to grow up to be a bastard...

24:56.823 --> 25:01.157
...and a rich kid to grow up to be a good man!
That's fate!

25:10.470 --> 25:11.698
Damn it!

25:11.871 --> 25:13.031
Hell, no!

25:13.373 --> 25:15.705
No...

25:22.816 --> 25:25.080
Time flies

25:35.195 --> 25:38.562
What should I do, honey? Whatever you say

25:38.932 --> 25:39.796
Should I kill her?

25:40.934 --> 25:42.265
Don't kill her?

25:45.538 --> 25:50.566
What a decisive man, my goodness!
What a decisive man!

25:52.178 --> 25:56.080
Listen to me, life has many stages

25:56.449 --> 25:59.748
I went through many difficulties
before getting this far

25:59.886 --> 26:04.152
It wasn't as easy as you think!
I didn't get it for free

26:04.391 --> 26:05.688
Someone once said...

26:05.859 --> 26:08.760
"No time to blink, keep striving for... "

26:08.928 --> 26:11.192
Fuck that! I ain't stupid!

26:11.531 --> 26:13.089
It's a line from your own film!

26:13.266 --> 26:16.099
Jin says that to Rose in "Last Wish"

26:16.269 --> 26:19.966
Want me to follow suit?

26:20.340 --> 26:24.071
Remember the cabaret scene
in "Dancing Factory"?

26:24.344 --> 26:26.403
You wrote the song lyrics as well

26:26.679 --> 26:29.273
I did some dancing there, too

26:55.942 --> 27:02.370
"I'm not going to listen to your words anymore"

27:02.615 --> 27:06.016
"All are a pack of lies! All out of hypocrisy!"

27:06.252 --> 27:13.624
"We'll make our own words"

27:16.396 --> 27:25.930
"We'll make our own truth"

27:26.239 --> 27:38.913
"I'm not going to listen to your words anymore"

28:06.412 --> 28:08.243
I'm sorry little one

28:09.015 --> 28:11.210
I really can't hold out

28:12.519 --> 28:13.747
I'm sorry!

28:18.691 --> 28:22.286
I ain't a good man... You don't even know me!

28:22.562 --> 28:24.462
How can you prove that I'm a good man!

28:24.697 --> 28:27.632
The truth is...

28:28.334 --> 28:33.203
Whenever an actor ask for my advice

28:33.439 --> 28:36.169
I always persuade them not to
work with Director Kim Chang

28:36.743 --> 28:38.005
Because...

28:41.047 --> 28:43.607
He's my sole rival

28:44.217 --> 28:50.019
I can't stand that jerk having
any good actors in his films

28:56.796 --> 29:00.630
You call this shit a confession?

29:01.034 --> 29:04.231
Do I look like an idiot to you?

29:05.939 --> 29:10.501
I've never said that you were a saint!

29:10.677 --> 29:15.307
Who the hell hasn't done a thing
as tedious as that?

29:15.782 --> 29:17.340
Give me a break

29:19.085 --> 29:24.113
Let me show you what a confession really is

29:24.290 --> 29:25.882
For example

29:26.326 --> 29:29.420
Before I left home this morning, I killed my wife

29:29.662 --> 29:31.653
I must have strangled her
for over 30 minutes

29:33.232 --> 29:38.295
Her tongue hung out all the way
and she shitted everywhere

29:39.339 --> 29:42.968
I was going to finish my son too,
but it was not that easy...

29:43.309 --> 29:47.040
I just couldn't do that...

29:49.282 --> 29:53.946
Now, that's what I call a confession!

29:54.687 --> 29:59.954
Your turn! Give me something nice and juicy

30:03.062 --> 30:06.293
Wait! I'll talk! I'll talk!

30:11.904 --> 30:14.134
There's a wardrobe called Kyung-Ah

30:16.776 --> 30:19.108
I offered to give her a ride home one day

30:20.313 --> 30:22.781
I lied that her home was on my way

30:24.851 --> 30:26.819
And then I drove her to a motel...

30:26.986 --> 30:30.854
We've been doing this for 3 years
already since "Bluebird"

30:34.961 --> 30:38.055
Love isn't a sin

30:38.164 --> 30:40.724
We dropped by a motel tonight, too

30:40.900 --> 30:43.630
Lakeside Motel, room 304

30:45.071 --> 30:47.938
We did it twice in three hours... No

30:48.341 --> 30:50.434
...three times in two hours

30:53.279 --> 30:54.974
I'm really sorry, honey

30:56.816 --> 31:01.446
Shouldn't have told you this when
you're already suffering so much

31:03.556 --> 31:05.251
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

31:08.094 --> 31:09.322
But then...

31:14.233 --> 31:16.394
You shouldn't mind this

31:17.270 --> 31:21.206
You've never had any real pains in
your life, and no worries either

31:22.475 --> 31:25.137
Know why I like Kyung-Ah?

31:28.181 --> 31:34.677
Unlike you, she's smart and
we can talk about many things

31:34.887 --> 31:37.947
As for you, I'd rather you
not to talk to me at all

31:38.124 --> 31:42.527
All you care to talk about are
clothes and plastic surgery!

31:43.830 --> 31:46.025
When I make love to you...

31:46.232 --> 31:50.498
I'm not sure whether I'm holding
a woman or a bag of silicon

31:50.703 --> 31:52.068
Guess how old my wife is

31:55.074 --> 31:56.939
Just one year younger than me...

31:57.143 --> 31:59.304
...but already a Botox junkie

31:59.512 --> 32:01.343
Now her expression doesn't
change even if she smiles

32:01.514 --> 32:03.982
What she has is not a face but a mask

32:04.250 --> 32:06.650
And that mask yelps at me everyday

32:06.919 --> 32:09.353
"I love you, honey!"

32:09.555 --> 32:15.516
Mi-ran, be honest for just this once in your life

32:15.828 --> 32:18.023
Do you know what love is?

32:18.264 --> 32:20.562
Don't pity yourself for losing your fingers

32:20.700 --> 32:23.828
They don't deserve any tears

32:24.137 --> 32:26.298
Because you can play shit

32:26.506 --> 32:27.973
Plus, you don't cook and you never clean...

32:28.174 --> 32:33.737
You hands have no use anyway
other than wearing jewelry

32:35.181 --> 32:37.081
Listen

32:37.283 --> 32:40.081
What is an artist without talent?

32:40.286 --> 32:41.651
"Nada"

32:41.821 --> 32:45.951
Not existing! A "nothing"

32:46.259 --> 32:53.791
Like a ring without a hole or a square ball!
Get it?

32:54.767 --> 32:58.066
If you can't play, it'll be nice and quiet here

32:58.237 --> 32:59.465
Also...

33:00.006 --> 33:02.998
It's so much lighter for you to wave "Bye-bye"!

33:03.910 --> 33:05.707
No, no, no, not yet

33:08.014 --> 33:12.075
There's something else I've been trying to say...

33:13.019 --> 33:15.920
I've been holding it back
for a whole 10 years now

33:17.190 --> 33:18.384
Curious?

33:21.093 --> 33:23.220
Screw you, bitch!

33:30.603 --> 33:33.333
Truth is, she has an affair too

33:33.472 --> 33:36.270
Know the tenor she plays accompaniment for?

33:36.442 --> 33:38.740
He's her lover! Do you know?

33:38.878 --> 33:41.972
I saw it all when I was following her around

33:42.515 --> 33:46.747
Am I wrong? Speak up for yourself

33:47.186 --> 33:50.553
Oh, I forgot you're gagged

33:50.723 --> 33:53.487
But you can nod, can't you?

33:53.693 --> 33:57.652
Do what you should do!

34:00.266 --> 34:03.030
Ah... You already knew!

34:03.169 --> 34:05.137
Didn't you? Didn't you?

34:06.839 --> 34:08.534
How about this

34:09.775 --> 34:12.243
I'm kind of depressed

34:12.411 --> 34:14.777
So if you really want to buy some time...

34:15.047 --> 34:17.174
...you can try to make me laugh

34:17.315 --> 34:20.752
Every time you succeed, I'll extend
the deadline for another 5 minutes

34:20.920 --> 34:24.286
You've made good comedies

34:24.357 --> 34:29.487
Now, you can try your hand on acting in one

34:30.161 --> 34:31.288
Okay

34:32.899 --> 34:34.092
Ready and...

34:34.333 --> 34:35.800
You son of a bitch!

34:36.534 --> 34:40.437
You... you've never seen me
losing my temper, right?

34:40.606 --> 34:42.870
I'm going to show it to you now

34:43.509 --> 34:45.443
You son of a bitch

34:45.678 --> 34:49.670
Your dad was a moron and
he made you a loser

34:49.949 --> 34:51.246
Is that my fault?

34:51.417 --> 34:53.748
Did I rob your blank?!

34:53.920 --> 34:57.014
Did I steal your wife?

34:57.356 --> 34:59.916
What do I have to do with
your unhappy existence?

35:00.159 --> 35:02.889
Shame on you, moron

35:03.062 --> 35:07.692
Why don't you just kill yourself?
Your life is a waste of time anyway

35:08.200 --> 35:09.827
Want me to make you laugh?

35:10.403 --> 35:13.133
Do you know who you're talking to?

35:13.339 --> 35:18.003
I'm Ryu Ji-ho, "the" Ryu Ji-ho!

35:18.344 --> 35:20.710
You're merely a lowlife extra!
Want me to make you... what?

35:21.614 --> 35:24.777
Get the hell out of here

35:25.384 --> 35:27.978
Just untie me and go home!

35:28.154 --> 35:31.487
Go fix your son some instant noodles, okay?!

35:35.061 --> 35:39.760
You've freaked me out and corrupted me!

35:40.099 --> 35:42.590
Your mission has been completed!

35:43.269 --> 35:45.464
I'll never mention what happened today

35:45.638 --> 35:47.970
If you want her fingers this much...

35:48.274 --> 35:50.071
...cut them all off!

35:50.710 --> 35:52.575
Or better, just cut off her hands!

35:52.812 --> 35:56.908
Why bother cutting off her fingers one by one?

35:57.717 --> 36:00.880
Just finish it quickly and get the hell out of here

36:01.153 --> 36:02.814
I want nothing more

36:04.724 --> 36:05.782
No, wait!

36:18.137 --> 36:20.037
My closing statement

37:24.270 --> 37:28.764
You've never gone for cheap laugh
like this in your comedies

37:29.975 --> 37:33.741
You're so disappointing!

37:33.913 --> 37:35.210
Wait, wait!

37:35.781 --> 37:38.614
I was too wound up and... I made mistakes

37:38.784 --> 37:42.276
I swear I didn't mean to do so... Wait! Wait!

37:45.925 --> 37:47.517
What are you doing now?

37:48.961 --> 37:50.519
What are you doing?

37:52.832 --> 37:54.732
Wait, wait, wait

37:55.301 --> 37:57.360
Give me one more chance

37:57.870 --> 38:00.998
Just give me one more try! Please! I beg you!

38:01.273 --> 38:05.937
My pose was bad, and I couldn't
help making that kind of mistakes

38:06.545 --> 38:08.012
Don't be so inflexible!
Just once more chance...

38:08.247 --> 38:09.441
Damn it

38:13.119 --> 38:18.648
I shouldn't have given you any false hope...

38:19.692 --> 38:23.219
Nowadays, if you get to
the hospital within 10 hours...

38:23.529 --> 38:26.020
...they can reattach the fingers neatly

38:36.509 --> 38:40.878
No! Wait! I'll do it! I'll kill her!
Look, I'm doing it now!

38:43.015 --> 38:44.243
You bastard!

38:44.416 --> 38:46.441
I said I was going to do it!

38:47.453 --> 38:49.717
Why didn't you wait?!

38:55.828 --> 39:00.697
You saw it too! You know I have no choice

39:00.966 --> 39:02.934
Honey, I'm going to do it, okay?

39:03.169 --> 39:05.899
That was three... Three, so, seven...

39:06.071 --> 39:08.437
You'll keep your seven, honey!

39:08.607 --> 39:11.576
I'm not doing this because I hate you, okay?

39:12.778 --> 39:16.214
You think I'm doing this
because I hate your wife?

39:16.415 --> 39:18.610
"Hate" is nobody's fault

39:19.151 --> 39:24.987
For example, who do you think
she hates more right now?

39:25.357 --> 39:27.188
Me or you?

39:27.560 --> 39:30.120
Let's hear it!

39:31.397 --> 39:32.295
Kill her!

39:32.498 --> 39:35.399
Kill her! What are you waiting for, idiot?

39:35.868 --> 39:40.601
Kill her! Kill her!

39:45.244 --> 39:47.405
You see?

39:49.415 --> 39:54.751
Easy, ma'am

39:55.221 --> 39:58.418
You probably will get one
finger left on each hand

39:58.924 --> 40:02.883
He's got to give in by that time

40:04.330 --> 40:07.322
You can still become a percussionist

40:07.566 --> 40:10.797
No law against playing drums
with "Chopsticks"

40:11.870 --> 40:17.274
Common folks like me prefer
drum beats to music

40:17.943 --> 40:20.935
No! No!

42:14.026 --> 42:19.089
You're right, better to just cut off her whole hand

42:24.069 --> 42:27.596
Damn time flies...

42:28.707 --> 42:30.504
47 seconds...

42:30.809 --> 42:32.606
46 seconds...

42:33.145 --> 42:34.908
- No! - 45 seconds...

42:35.247 --> 42:39.183
44 seconds, 43 seconds

42:39.752 --> 42:43.586
42 seconds, 41 seconds

42:43.956 --> 42:47.687
40 seconds, 39 seconds

42:48.026 --> 42:51.792
38 seconds, 37 seconds

42:53.465 --> 42:56.764
36 seconds, 35 seconds...

42:57.069 --> 43:00.903
34 seconds, 33 seconds

43:01.540 --> 43:05.704
32 seconds, 31 seconds

43:06.311 --> 43:08.279
30 seconds, 29 seconds

43:08.414 --> 43:10.143
25 seconds...

43:10.449 --> 43:12.440
22 seconds...

43:12.751 --> 43:15.845
20 seconds, 19 seconds

43:16.021 --> 43:19.149
18 seconds, 17 seconds

43:19.992 --> 43:23.359
16 seconds, 15 seconds...

43:23.729 --> 43:25.697
14 seconds, 13 seconds

43:25.964 --> 43:29.263
12 seconds, 11 seconds

43:29.601 --> 43:30.795
10 seconds

43:31.537 --> 43:33.095
9 seconds

43:33.672 --> 43:35.503
8 seconds

43:36.508 --> 43:38.533
- No! - 7 seconds!

43:38.944 --> 43:39.876
6 seconds!

43:40.579 --> 43:41.671
5 seconds!

43:42.381 --> 43:43.370
4 seconds!

43:43.882 --> 43:45.008
3 seconds!

45:15.641 --> 45:16.903
Mr. Director...

45:17.910 --> 45:20.037
How about this?

45:24.116 --> 45:26.414
For example...

45:49.641 --> 45:51.404
You scumbags...

45:56.815 --> 45:58.715
I'll take revenge!

46:39.558 --> 46:41.150
I'm sorry

46:42.361 --> 46:45.660
I'm sorry; it can't be helped

46:46.164 --> 46:48.928
I tried my best! You saw it all!

46:49.468 --> 46:51.595
Yes, you did!

46:51.737 --> 46:56.367
I have to do this for my wife, you know

46:58.343 --> 47:00.868
I really love her

47:01.747 --> 47:05.649
It's hard for a kid like you to understand

47:05.817 --> 47:08.877
The world is filled with things
you can't get away from

47:09.021 --> 47:11.615
No matter how hard you struggle...

47:12.257 --> 47:15.522
...there are things you're being forced to do

47:18.964 --> 47:20.261
Dear...

47:20.399 --> 47:24.267
Alright, honey! Just wait a bit!
I'll take care of it!

47:25.404 --> 47:28.840
I'm sorry... really sorry...

47:31.109 --> 47:32.167
- I'm sorry... -Ple... please!

47:32.310 --> 47:37.475
Don't rush me! I'm trying! It'll be over soon!

47:40.385 --> 47:44.185
I'm sorry I shouted, honey;
you know I love you!

47:45.724 --> 47:49.592
I don't believe you have another man!
I don't care even if it's true!

47:49.895 --> 47:51.328
I'm going to forget it all

47:51.496 --> 47:54.897
After all, I'm the head of the house

47:56.601 --> 48:00.264
I must forget everything happened today

48:00.372 --> 48:02.340
I'll just think of it as a dream

48:02.507 --> 48:03.633
I love you, honey!

48:05.711 --> 48:11.946
I'm so sorry, kid! I'm truly sorry

48:12.250 --> 48:13.808
Please forgive me

48:14.352 --> 48:16.946
I love you, Mi-ran!

48:17.489 --> 48:21.391
