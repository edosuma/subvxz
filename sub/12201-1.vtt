WEBVTT

02:57.693 --> 02:59.976
Alright, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.247
Tommy, I gotta go. Shit came up.

03:05.601 --> 03:10.239
Brady, it's the same shit every day.
You gotta go, you gotta go, you're done!

03:45.456 --> 03:49.508
Hey, Kate's in trouble. We gotta
go do a little lumpy bumpy. You in?

03:49.962 --> 03:51.451
Say no more.

04:00.605 --> 04:03.541
Don't you ever learn?
When are you gonna stop this shit?

04:03.641 --> 04:05.277
What the hell happened, Kate?

04:05.377 --> 04:08.884
We just went to the mini-mart to
get some smokes and they jumped me.

04:08.984 --> 04:10.883
Are you sure you weren't
fighting in the yard?

04:10.983 --> 04:15.282
No, I swear. They took my purse
and it's got all my shit in it.

04:18.656 --> 04:20.726
Get your ass in the car.

04:28.084 --> 04:32.188
Shit, it ain't shit. What you got, Stakes?

04:32.288 --> 04:34.639
What you mean, what I got? My house, my week.

04:34.739 --> 04:35.541
Alright.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.308
You think I got the name Stakes for nothin'?

04:37.408 --> 04:40.575
You got that Cirque du Soleil shit.
Come on, let me see it. There you go.

04:53.309 --> 04:55.359
What you do now, Gracey?

05:03.518 --> 05:04.887
- What else you got?
- What I got?

05:04.987 --> 05:08.005
- That ain't shit.
- Yo, Jabs is outside, we got a problem.

05:08.105 --> 05:10.680
Problem, there's a problem.

05:20.085 --> 05:21.098
Fuck you, bitch.

05:21.202 --> 05:24.023
Calm the fuck down. What's wrong with you?

05:24.123 --> 05:27.192
You know we gotta get the fuck out of here.
What's wrong with you, it's our fucking money.

05:27.292 --> 05:28.294
Fuck that bitch!

05:28.394 --> 05:32.806
Is that how you run shit up in here now,
Stakes? You let them go around robbin' people?

05:34.266 --> 05:37.883
Jabs, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.338
I'm sorry, Kate.

05:40.438 --> 05:43.525
Hey, yo! Bring them over here right now.

05:43.775 --> 05:45.611
Grace, come here.

05:45.811 --> 05:49.829
Gracey, come here. Bring your ass, woman.

05:51.383 --> 05:52.732
- Tell them you're sorry.
- Sorry.

05:52.832 --> 05:56.306
Tell the bitch you're sorry.
Stakes on his bullshit again.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.041
I'm sorry.

06:03.995 --> 06:06.837
I'm sorry I didn't knock
them motherfucking teeth out.

06:49.173 --> 06:52.190
Man, that's for you.

06:52.844 --> 06:55.947
You're doing a good job, alright?
Making quite a name for yourself, keep it up.

06:56.047 --> 06:59.217
Alright, let's go, people. Fight's over.

06:59.317 --> 07:02.053
50 bucks? What the hell is this?

07:02.153 --> 07:06.525
Like Gamble said, make a name
for yourself and you'll get to the yard.

07:06.625 --> 07:09.928
Look, these people just ain't
that into you yet, girl.

07:10.028 --> 07:13.534
There's only like 25 people here.
I prolly made less than you.

07:13.634 --> 07:17.436
Look, take your money, get on the bus,
get the fuck up out the Valley, okay?

07:17.536 --> 07:21.189
Pretty little white girls with cash don't last
long around here, you know what I mean?

07:24.643 --> 07:26.244
Hey.

07:26.544 --> 07:28.829
Not bad for a knock around girl.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.457
What the hell are you doin' here?

07:38.057 --> 07:40.892
- Got your ass beat, didn't ya?
- Hungry don't lose.

07:40.992 --> 07:44.530
- How do I look though, for real?
- You look like you got in a fight.

07:44.630 --> 07:48.100
The fuck is wrong with you, huh?
You fuckin' lie to me about where you are?

07:48.200 --> 07:52.103
One of these days, one of these big ass
bitches is gonna kick your fuckin' head in...

07:52.203 --> 07:54.974
...and I don't want that,
'cause I fuckin' love you, alright?

07:55.074 --> 07:59.445
You gotta quit this shit. Alright?
You do look really fuckin' sexy though.

07:59.545 --> 08:02.013
Alright, none of that.
Fight starts in 30 minutes.

08:02.113 --> 08:05.384
Jabs is fighting Payton
and I ain't missin' that shit.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.753
- Now you gotta pay our fee.
- And what fee is that?

08:07.853 --> 08:09.922
- The fee to get past us.
- Oh, yeah?

08:10.022 --> 08:12.492
No more! Let's get the fuck out of here.

08:13.492 --> 08:15.427
Your fee, huh?

08:15.527 --> 08:17.729
Let me know when you wanna come get it.

08:18.229 --> 08:21.634
- Here's your fuckin' fee.
- Girls, let's fuckin' go.

08:41.001 --> 08:43.955
- Come on, Payton, you got this.
- Do you mind, asshole?

08:44.054 --> 08:47.026
No, I don't mind. Jabs is gonna
get that ass whooped tonight.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.610
About time somebody knocked that bitch out.

08:52.164 --> 08:53.732
Hell, she's not.

08:53.832 --> 08:57.018
Yeah, Jabs, get it!
Come on, Jabs, you got this!

09:06.846 --> 09:09.547
You wanna make money, girl?
This is where you gotta be.

09:09.747 --> 09:11.450
This the pay lode right here.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.451
Maybe we should be saying
the same to you guys.

09:13.551 --> 09:16.055
I mean, clearly you're not
the promoters on this one.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.273
Maybe you two need to step up your game some.

09:18.373 --> 09:23.228
Ain't no more fighters around here anyway.
When there is, believe me, we'll be on that.

09:23.328 --> 09:26.999
- Speaking of real fighters.
- What's up, Church? What's up, Gracey?

09:27.099 --> 09:30.302
What's up? You owe me a thousand bucks,
what do you mean what's up?

09:30.402 --> 09:34.505
You're right, I owe you money. Come by
tomorrow night and you got your money.

09:34.605 --> 09:38.093
- I ain't gonna stiff my meanest fighter...
- Exactly, don't forget that.

09:42.147 --> 09:43.996
What are you looking at?

09:44.550 --> 09:46.819
Yo, you're in my seat.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.554
- You're in my face.
- I'mma need you to move.

09:49.654 --> 09:52.590
What the hell's your problem, Gracey,
could we watch the fight, really?

09:52.690 --> 09:55.444
- Am I interrupting your show?
- Guys, ignore her.

09:55.544 --> 09:57.695
- You know what she's trying to do.
- Ignore me?

09:57.795 --> 09:59.464
- Yeah.
- You can't ignore me.

09:59.564 --> 10:03.568
Gracey, can you back the hell up? Can we
please watch the fight? Is that possible?

10:03.668 --> 10:07.121
Can you go one single day without being
the biggest pain in the ass in this town?

10:07.221 --> 10:11.246
No, you got it all wrong, that's me.
Sit your bitch ass down.

10:11.346 --> 10:13.445
Come put me down.
I'm too crazy to be scared of you.

10:13.545 --> 10:18.123
Enough, damn. I can't believe
I paid 30 bucks for this shit.

10:18.223 --> 10:21.151
Oh, that's how much
you made at your last fight?

10:21.251 --> 10:24.546
- Hell with this shit! Outside now!
- Bitch!

10:35.000 --> 10:37.002
You don't want that.

11:35.493 --> 11:38.700
Jabs, back, come on,
Jabs, come on, calm down.

12:03.954 --> 12:07.426
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Tori Coro.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.896
I came into your gym
for a lesson about a year ago.

12:12.096 --> 12:16.166
No idea, but in case you haven't noticed,
I could use a little privacy.

12:16.266 --> 12:18.668
- Teach me how to fight like that.
- Like what?

12:18.768 --> 12:20.536
Like you.

12:20.636 --> 12:23.375
- How old are you?
- 22.

12:23.475 --> 12:26.978
- And you're a knock around girl?
- How did you know?

12:27.078 --> 12:31.012
Because I know everyone in the Valley.
Besides, your knuckles, they're way too pretty.

12:31.112 --> 12:35.000
Well, put me on the inside. Teach me.

12:35.954 --> 12:39.425
Look, I didn't learn to fight at 22.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.570
I have been beating the crap out
of girls since I was six years old...

12:42.670 --> 12:45.240
...because little Suzie didn't want
to share her dolls with me.

12:45.340 --> 12:49.683
Now you wanna learn how to throw a punch?
Go to L.A. Boxing, I am not interested.

12:50.243 --> 12:52.638
- Why do you run a gym?
- Because I can.

12:52.738 --> 12:56.107
Now get it through your head.
I don't train fighters.

12:56.207 --> 12:59.678
I fight for all the wrong reasons because
I'm pissed off when I get out there.

12:59.778 --> 13:03.081
You don't see me smiling
and hugging my opponents.

13:03.181 --> 13:06.619
No, all I see is a piece of meat
and a meal ticket.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.137
Now get out of my locker room.

13:13.191 --> 13:16.260
<i>In this country, you gotta make your money.</i>

13:16.810 --> 13:21.366
That's the thing though, Jabs always
been like that, like cold as ice.

13:21.966 --> 13:25.338
Took a lot of balls to do what you did.
You sure you ain't a dude?

13:25.438 --> 13:28.873
My baby definitely ain't a guy,
I can vouch for that.

13:31.176 --> 13:33.645
Jabs is turning you into a monster.

13:34.445 --> 13:36.915
Alright ladies, it's been real,
but I'm heading out.

13:37.015 --> 13:40.542
I'll walk with you, I'm going
that way anyway. Bye, baby girl.

13:40.642 --> 13:42.284
Later!

13:50.596 --> 13:52.711
Hey, how you doin'?

13:58.070 --> 14:01.339
Again? What the hell happened to you?

14:01.739 --> 14:05.144
- Were you down in the Valley fighting again?
- I'm fine, Dad, it's nothing.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.943
Nothing? You look like you got
dragged down the street by your feet.

14:09.043 --> 14:12.357
Dad, I'm good, I swear.
Just some girls were talkin' shit...

14:12.457 --> 14:15.556
...and I did what you always tell me
to do, stick up for myself, right?

14:15.967 --> 14:20.238
- Well, did you win at least?
- Of course she won, she's a Coro.

14:21.092 --> 14:24.029
- You taught her well, G-Note.
- G-Note?

14:24.129 --> 14:27.732
It's Gino, alright? Do I look like some
sort of rapper to you or something?

14:27.832 --> 14:31.903
No, but Gino sounds like G-Note,
so I thought I'd switch it up a little bit.

14:32.003 --> 14:36.040
Relax, homie, but you do look like
one of them gambino motherfuckers.

14:36.140 --> 14:39.611
Remember whose house you're livin' in,
whose roof you're under, who's feedin' you.

14:39.711 --> 14:41.403
- Sorry.
- You better chill out.

14:41.503 --> 14:45.016
- I'm just messin' with you, Gino.
- It's all good, pops, don't worry.

14:45.116 --> 14:48.076
Yeah, go inside.
Get out of here, leave me alone.

16:18.709 --> 16:23.615
- Is that you, sweetie?
- No, it's a robber, and I demand food.

16:23.715 --> 16:26.797
- Aunt Windsor's here!
- Yes!

16:27.651 --> 16:29.467
What's up?

16:31.221 --> 16:34.459
- What's this?
- I drew you a picture, do you like it?

16:34.559 --> 16:38.629
- I love it, thank you.
- Did you see dead bodies today?

16:38.729 --> 16:40.387
You and your questions.

16:40.487 --> 16:45.503
I saw your story, crazy stuff.
And right down the road, no less.

16:45.603 --> 16:49.256
Remind me to call Tom in advanced
securities and check on the security system.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.443
Yeah, I will.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.559
My book came?

16:55.413 --> 16:57.515
- Oh, my gosh.
- What is it?

16:57.615 --> 17:00.618
This is a book on profiling.

17:00.718 --> 17:03.596
It has great reviews,
but this guy's technique is awesome.

17:05.056 --> 17:07.693
What, is he a magician or something?

17:08.393 --> 17:10.328
No, you know what he does?

17:10.428 --> 17:12.731
He can tell if somebody's
lying to you or not...

17:12.830 --> 17:17.635
...by analyzing their nonverbals,
their body language, eye contact.

17:17.734 --> 17:20.573
So I could tell if you're lying or not?

17:21.772 --> 17:23.354
Yes.

17:24.008 --> 17:26.176
Oh, by the way, is Dale coming for dinner?

17:26.277 --> 17:27.826
No.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.482
You're lucky I'm tired!

17:31.882 --> 17:35.800
No, Mom, I just...
I need some space right now.

17:36.454 --> 17:40.522
Actually, I don't know what I want.
I just... I know I don't want him.

17:40.622 --> 17:43.895
Sweetie, you can't dump Dale.
He's one of the richest men in...

17:43.995 --> 17:47.599
Richest guys, Mom?
What's that got to do with anything?

17:47.699 --> 17:52.404
I don't care if he's rich or poor.
What about just good old fashioned love?

17:52.504 --> 17:55.406
Windsor, you need a man
to take care of you...

17:55.506 --> 17:58.276
...someone that can provide
the essentials in life.

17:58.376 --> 18:02.058
Mom, Mom. I don't need a man in my life.

18:02.158 --> 18:05.450
I'm 30 years old,
I can provide money for myself.

18:05.550 --> 18:09.123
I don't need a man, I want
someone that I'm attracted to...

18:09.223 --> 18:12.556
...because honestly,
if I don't have sex very, very soon...

18:12.656 --> 18:17.028
Windsor, I am your mother
and your nieces are here.

18:17.128 --> 18:20.332
My bad. Listen, I'm gonna
go freshen up, I'm starving.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.041
Okay.

19:00.572 --> 19:03.562
- What now?
- Why do you always have to say what now?

19:03.662 --> 19:06.464
Because every time I ask how are you...

19:06.564 --> 19:10.115
...there's some smart ass comment like,
do you really care?

19:10.215 --> 19:14.785
We both know I care how you are,
or I wouldn't ask the question.

19:14.885 --> 19:19.557
I just figured what now
gets right to the point.

19:19.957 --> 19:22.639
So, what now?

19:23.293 --> 19:25.784
- I need to borrow some money.
- No.

19:25.884 --> 19:28.165
Come on, Windsor, why the fuck not?

19:28.265 --> 19:31.248
Because you chose to live with Dad,
that's why the fuck not.

19:31.348 --> 19:34.404
Look, I just wanna get
out of this place, okay?

19:34.504 --> 19:36.991
Duke and I are trying to get
an apartment down in Cherry Hill...

19:37.091 --> 19:40.411
...all we need is the down payment,
that's it, Windsor.

19:40.511 --> 19:42.513
And since when do you have
something against Dad?

19:42.613 --> 19:44.955
<i>No, I happen to love Dad very much...</i>

19:45.055 --> 19:47.676
...but taking you
into the heart of gang world...

19:47.776 --> 19:51.602
...knowing that he couldn't support you
wasn't a very smart decision, was it?

19:51.702 --> 19:56.056
And him drinking his life away, not even
making it a priority to go get a job...

19:56.156 --> 20:00.397
...so that you don't have to call
your older sister begging for money.

20:01.197 --> 20:04.614
I'm sorry, Tori, I love Dad, I do...

20:04.714 --> 20:06.722
...but he has made some bad decisions.

20:06.822 --> 20:10.709
Yeah, and having you was one of them.
Thanks for nothin'.

20:29.359 --> 20:31.830
- So what'd she say?
- She said no.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.765
Just being a bitch like always.

20:33.865 --> 20:37.336
I mean, that's why I moved
out here in the first place.

20:38.786 --> 20:41.623
We only need like two grand and we
could get out of here, you know?

20:41.723 --> 20:45.242
- What about your mom? Why don't we ask her?
- Absolutely not.

20:45.342 --> 20:48.378
She's still pissed at me
for taking sides with my dad.

20:48.878 --> 20:51.782
Honestly, they don't give a shit about me.

20:51.882 --> 20:55.148
- They could care less if I was dead.
- Speaking of money...

20:55.248 --> 20:58.488
...I'm gonna go run to the consignment shop,
see if I can make us a couple bucks.

20:58.588 --> 21:01.819
- You wanna come or you wanna stay here?
- No, I'm good, babe. I'm just gonna...

21:01.919 --> 21:04.607
- ...stay here and clear my head.
- Okay.

21:05.561 --> 21:07.565
- I love you.
- I love you too.

21:07.665 --> 21:11.194
Yanni's gonna stay with you, okay?
See you later.

21:15.038 --> 21:18.041
- So you fight?
- Excuse me?

21:18.141 --> 21:20.311
Just asking.
Do you know this guy named Stakes?

21:20.411 --> 21:22.692
Yeah, I dealt with him.

21:22.846 --> 21:26.885
- You one of his fighters?
- I've thrown a couple punches, why?

21:27.685 --> 21:31.169
- Ever been to the yard?
- What yard?

21:32.123 --> 21:35.426
You don't know him very well then.
That's where his big fighters are.

21:35.526 --> 21:37.963
That's where you're gonna make the money.

21:56.714 --> 22:00.752
Is there anybody that she borrowed
money from or loaned money to?

22:00.852 --> 22:03.777
- No.
- Mom?

22:04.638 --> 22:07.025
- What's happening?
- I'm Detective Mackler...

22:07.125 --> 22:11.530
- ...this is my partner Detective Tillman.
- Unfortunately we have some bad news.

22:13.330 --> 22:16.534
We found your sister's body
a couple of hours ago.

22:22.907 --> 22:24.843
I don't understand.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.844
How did she die?

22:26.944 --> 22:29.447
Looks like she was in a fight with someone.

22:29.547 --> 22:31.316
They're still trying to investigate it.

22:31.416 --> 22:35.699
A fisherman had found her body
next to some brush down by the river.

22:36.653 --> 22:40.257
Ms. Coro, we'll contact you
if we have anything.

22:40.957 --> 22:43.450
We'll leave you to be with your family.

24:29.599 --> 24:33.829
I never got to tell you that I was... proud.

24:37.475 --> 24:41.159
You grew up so strong, stubborn...

24:43.213 --> 24:45.065
...but strong.

24:49.219 --> 24:51.269
Tough as you were...

24:52.723 --> 24:55.775
...someone still took your life...

24:58.429 --> 25:01.047
...and I can't trade places with you.

25:03.101 --> 25:05.148
But I promise you this...

25:05.902 --> 25:08.152
...I'm gonna find out...

25:08.906 --> 25:10.722
...who did it...

25:12.176 --> 25:15.205
...and I'm gonna take from them
what they took from you.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.461
Hey.

25:30.561 --> 25:33.598
Do you mind if I have
a word with my daughter?

25:33.698 --> 25:37.180
- Don't you mean our daughter?
- I beg to differ.

25:37.834 --> 25:41.685
You really gonna stand here
and argue me over Tori's body now?

25:42.239 --> 25:45.491
How could you let this happen, Gino?

25:47.045 --> 25:48.843
Wasn't it your idea to leave me?

25:48.943 --> 25:52.130
Oh, so I'm just supposed
to work my ass off every day...

25:52.230 --> 25:57.087
...while you sit around playing cards, doing
lines and drinking beers with your buddies?

25:57.187 --> 26:00.824
Incidentally you smell like
a goddamn brewery, Gino.

26:00.924 --> 26:04.962
- Well, I'm done, okay?
- I was done three or four years ago.

26:05.062 --> 26:08.697
- Now give me a word with my daughter.
- Have your word with your daughter.

26:17.341 --> 26:18.856
Windsor?

26:20.610 --> 26:22.326
That's right.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.648
I'm Duke.

26:24.748 --> 26:27.218
This is Jamie and that's Yanni.

26:28.352 --> 26:31.621
- You're Duke?
- Yeah, um...

26:32.221 --> 26:34.025
...I'm your sister's girlfriend.

26:34.125 --> 26:38.576
I wish we could've met on different terms
and I'm truly sorry.

26:39.330 --> 26:43.781
- So you're Duke?
- Yep, I'm Duke.

26:45.735 --> 26:49.406
Do you guys have any idea what happened here?

26:49.606 --> 26:53.476
- I mean, we have an idea, but...
- Wait, what do you mean you have an...

26:54.778 --> 26:57.614
Is there somewhere quiet we can go and talk?

27:00.014 --> 27:01.988
Think she was fighting for money.

27:02.102 --> 27:04.655
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

27:04.755 --> 27:08.526
Can't you guys just get jobs
like everybody else?

27:08.626 --> 27:12.462
And my mother!
She sent her money like every week.

27:12.562 --> 27:15.858
You keep saying you guys, like you think
we're some kind of minority or something...

27:16.058 --> 27:20.111
- ...like you're better than us.
- Yeah, you ever been around here before?

27:20.571 --> 27:23.307
There are no jobs. Not good ones anyways.

27:23.407 --> 27:26.777
So what we do is what
we have to do to get by.

27:27.777 --> 27:31.288
Not with my sister you obviously didn't.
She's fucking dead.

27:31.748 --> 27:35.252
Yeah, we know,
we were at the funeral, remember?

27:35.352 --> 27:38.990
You piece of shit!
You think this is funny? She's dead!

27:39.090 --> 27:42.125
Get her out of my face, Duke.
I don't wanna hurt this girl.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.795
- Back the fuck up.
- Don't do anything, Yanni, not here.

27:44.895 --> 27:46.711
Chill out!

27:47.365 --> 27:50.984
Do not say another fuckin' word.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.354
Do not do anything.

27:58.708 --> 28:01.060
You're just gonna listen, okay?

28:03.814 --> 28:06.896
She was our best friend.

28:07.300 --> 28:08.949
My life.

28:09.453 --> 28:14.070
You have no idea what it's like
to live every day where we do.

28:14.924 --> 28:17.800
You're not the one that had to hold her...

28:17.900 --> 28:20.769
...every night when she was crying.

28:21.732 --> 28:24.022
You're not the one...

28:24.122 --> 28:28.372
...that had to convince her not to
fucking kill herself every day of her life.

28:29.172 --> 28:31.298
You're not the one...

28:31.748 --> 28:36.589
...who had to watch her struggle
and try to feed herself, we were.

28:37.748 --> 28:43.200
But you are the one that had the money
and the power to save her.

28:43.654 --> 28:46.124
You're the one she called for help.

28:46.624 --> 28:50.045
Now I'm not saying that this is your fault...

28:50.694 --> 28:52.969
...but what I am saying is...

28:53.569 --> 28:56.381
...what that poor girl needs is closure.

28:57.435 --> 28:59.518
And to find that fucking son of a bitch...

28:59.618 --> 29:02.827
...that did this to her,
that's what Tori needs.

29:04.041 --> 29:06.109
I live with your father.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.714
Tori and I shared the basement together.

29:10.414 --> 29:13.618
I'll call you if I hear anything.
I'm sure Gino's got your number, right?

29:13.718 --> 29:15.400
Yeah.

29:17.854 --> 29:19.904
This was Tori's.

29:21.958 --> 29:25.581
She always said fight for what you love.

29:31.235 --> 29:33.037
What are you gonna do?

29:33.137 --> 29:37.421
- Why was she fighting for money?
- I don't know, I have no idea.

29:38.475 --> 29:41.149
I didn't have the cash flow to
give her the materialistic things...

29:41.249 --> 29:44.581
...that you and your mom have,
but she had what she needed.

29:44.688 --> 29:50.054
We have that stuff because we worked
for it, it wasn't just handed to us.

29:50.154 --> 29:53.817
And I, maybe, get to see Mom
for like two hours at night...

29:53.917 --> 29:57.153
- ...when I come home from work.
- How's it goin'?

29:57.253 --> 29:59.164
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

29:59.264 --> 30:01.598
- What's up, Yanni?
- Gino.

30:01.698 --> 30:04.267
Hey, what's up? What's up?

30:04.367 --> 30:06.268
- 'Sup?
- Hey Jamie, how you doin', sweetie?

30:06.368 --> 30:08.839
- Good.
- Everything alright?

30:08.939 --> 30:11.175
- You girls alright?
- We're good, thank you, Gino.

30:11.275 --> 30:14.877
- Alright.
- How you holding up, Windsor?

30:14.977 --> 30:17.428
You know, one day at a time.

30:24.055 --> 30:26.024
Whoa! My bad.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.359
What, you've never seen a naked girl before?

30:28.459 --> 30:32.043
No, it's just you're my sister's girlfriend.

30:32.143 --> 30:35.421
So wait, are you guys all like, um...

30:36.121 --> 30:37.400
What?

30:37.500 --> 30:38.969
Fuckin'?

30:39.569 --> 30:41.539
Look, we're all friends.

30:41.639 --> 30:45.290
We change in front of each other,
we hang out 'til four a.m. every night...

30:45.390 --> 30:47.474
...but we're not all lesbians.

30:48.378 --> 30:50.413
Not Yanni anyways.

30:50.713 --> 30:52.616
She walks me home at night.

30:52.716 --> 30:56.721
Number one rule of the knock around girls,
make sure the other one's safe.

30:57.321 --> 31:00.938
Besides, I love Tori very much.

31:01.492 --> 31:05.334
But you gotta watch out for this one,
Miss Out and Proud over here.

31:07.631 --> 31:09.566
Knock around girls?

31:09.666 --> 31:11.769
It's a term they use down in the Valley.

31:11.869 --> 31:15.505
If you not from there, then you one of us.

31:15.605 --> 31:18.509
- You a knock around girl.
- I don't follow.

31:18.609 --> 31:20.410
You ever get your ass kicked before?

31:20.510 --> 31:21.511
No.

31:21.611 --> 31:25.015
Been knocked around
by four or five girls at once?

31:25.815 --> 31:27.852
- No.
- Stabbed?

31:27.952 --> 31:29.553
No.

31:29.653 --> 31:33.723
Okay, well, that's what happens to outsiders
who wander down to the Valley.

31:33.823 --> 31:37.461
- So you might wanna make note of that.
- I see.

31:37.561 --> 31:39.630
You seem pretty proud of that.

31:40.930 --> 31:42.799
So this is it?

31:43.299 --> 31:45.735
This is where you guys spent your time?

31:46.035 --> 31:49.207
For the most part.
We didn't really go out that much.

31:49.307 --> 31:53.810
Maybe to go meet Jamie or grab a pack
of smokes, you know, just normal shit.

31:53.910 --> 31:57.014
But you said you're always banging knuckles?

31:57.114 --> 32:00.231
That does not sound normal to me.

32:00.851 --> 32:03.720
You're gonna need to rethink
your idea of normal.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.672
You did at least bring a taser, right?

32:08.266 --> 32:10.734
That was Tori's prized possession.

32:11.434 --> 32:13.484
She loved taking photos.

32:14.238 --> 32:17.807
She always talked about freezing time.

32:17.907 --> 32:19.762
Saving moments.

32:26.516 --> 32:30.169
- I'm off to bed.
- Yeah, I hear that, wait up.

32:32.623 --> 32:34.139
Duke.

32:36.593 --> 32:39.283
Welcome to the hood. See you around.

32:39.383 --> 32:42.214
Seriously, get a taser.

32:45.268 --> 32:47.608
You motioned for me to come down here.

32:48.037 --> 32:49.586
Why?

32:50.140 --> 32:52.223
I wanna know why you're here.

32:53.777 --> 32:58.047
- It's my house.
- No, uh-huh, it's my house.

32:58.147 --> 33:00.197
I wanna know why you're here.

33:00.517 --> 33:03.534
You're living with my father, it's...

33:04.588 --> 33:07.805
I'm sorry, you look...
you look so much like her.

33:10.059 --> 33:12.095
So where you staying?

33:12.565 --> 33:14.827
Well, I'm gonna be staying here...

33:14.927 --> 33:17.414
...until I find out who killed Tori.

33:18.268 --> 33:20.238
Have you heard anything?

33:20.338 --> 33:23.942
I don't know. We think she died
in a fight with another girl.

33:24.042 --> 33:26.911
Wait, what? Who?

33:27.011 --> 33:29.247
Word on the street is
she died in Fight Valley.

33:29.347 --> 33:32.567
What the fuck is Fight Valley?
Take me to them!

33:32.667 --> 33:36.295
Okay, listen, princess,
this isn't your little royal kingdom...

33:36.395 --> 33:39.197
...where you say fetch me my chariot
and you got little rose bearers...

33:39.297 --> 33:41.108
...throwing rose petals at your feet, okay?

33:41.208 --> 33:44.913
This is Camden, New Jersey,
the number one murder capital of the US...

33:45.013 --> 33:50.066
...so you can leave that take me to him
bullshit back at your castle, okay?

33:53.720 --> 33:56.222
This Fight Valley, where is it?

33:56.322 --> 33:59.727
It's about a couple miles
down the road. In Camden.

33:59.827 --> 34:03.280
It's one of the neighborhoods that got
its name from this guy they call Stakes.

34:03.380 --> 34:06.116
It's where you go to fight
if you got a problem.

34:06.216 --> 34:08.982
They give you a bunch of money
and you work out your problems.

34:09.252 --> 34:13.056
But you said someone told you
that she died at Fight Valley.

34:13.156 --> 34:15.925
Can't that someone tell you where it is?

34:16.025 --> 34:18.674
Everybody acts like they don't know anything.

34:18.928 --> 34:21.779
Plus Valley people don't talk to outsiders.

34:22.433 --> 34:25.264
You gotta start beef with somebody,
do a couple small fights...

34:25.364 --> 34:28.170
...earn some respect and guess what?

34:28.270 --> 34:30.244
I'm not about to become
an underground fighter.

34:30.370 --> 34:33.810
And Tori? She never mentioned this to you?

34:33.909 --> 34:37.614
Nope, not a word. Prolly because
she knew I wouldn't let her do it.

34:37.714 --> 34:39.917
Half the time she was fightin' I had no idea.

34:40.016 --> 34:41.952
She'd tell me she's gonna
go grab a pack of smokes...

34:42.052 --> 34:46.155
...come back a couple hours later
all bruised up, saying she got jumped.

34:46.255 --> 34:50.393
But what I do know is apparently you
gotta get invited to one of these things.

34:50.494 --> 34:52.896
There's a guy I'm gonna go talk to tomorrow.

34:52.996 --> 34:55.531
Tori did a couple small fights
for him for some cash.

34:55.630 --> 34:58.069
If anybody knows, he does.

34:58.469 --> 35:01.951
Alright, that's what I'm gonna do then.

35:02.205 --> 35:04.048
Where do I start?

35:04.775 --> 35:07.184
Your pretty little royal ass...

35:07.284 --> 35:11.148
...you step foot on that street and
they're gonna eat you alive, Cinderella.

35:11.648 --> 35:13.465
Goodnight.

35:25.862 --> 35:28.766
Guess they'll let just
about anybody in here, huh?

35:28.866 --> 35:31.268
What the hell happened, Jabs?

35:31.618 --> 35:34.703
It's called fighting, not ballet, princess.

35:35.403 --> 35:37.928
Stay the hell out of my cage,
you're not a cage fighter.

35:38.028 --> 35:42.112
Stick to the streets where you belong.
Hell, you're not even a professional.

35:42.412 --> 35:45.090
In case you haven't noticed, uh,
it looks like you're in a situation...

35:45.190 --> 35:48.485
...you can't control right now.
Might wanna go.

35:48.585 --> 35:50.821
Anytime, anywhere.

35:51.621 --> 35:54.792
This place smells like a litter box.
There's nothing but shit in here.

35:54.892 --> 35:58.061
- You know where to find me.
- Good. See you soon?

35:58.161 --> 36:01.241
Oh, one thing's for certain,
you'll see me soon.

36:05.668 --> 36:09.072
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there...

36:09.172 --> 36:11.241
In the balls? Really?

36:13.410 --> 36:17.465
- What can I get you?
- Um, cranberry juice, please.

36:23.419 --> 36:25.305
Thank you.

36:28.459 --> 36:30.308
Are you lost?

36:32.062 --> 36:34.231
No, I live right down the street.

36:35.131 --> 36:38.002
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

36:38.102 --> 36:42.153
I'm actually headed over
to Fight Valley after this.

36:43.907 --> 36:45.788
Wanna go?

36:46.342 --> 36:48.312
Fight Valley, huh?

36:48.412 --> 36:50.901
Yep. Ever been?

36:51.001 --> 36:53.153
Supposed to be a pretty good fight tonight.

36:54.283 --> 36:56.135
Never heard of it.

36:59.989 --> 37:02.159
Yo, what's good, mama?

37:02.259 --> 37:03.826
Hi, how are you?

37:03.926 --> 37:07.064
Not bad, how about yourself?
What you getting into tonight?

37:07.164 --> 37:09.466
Nothin, just killin' time.

37:09.566 --> 37:14.091
Waiting for my girlfriend to text me back
the address for Fight Valley.

37:14.571 --> 37:16.712
Yeah, we were supposed to meet there, but...

37:16.812 --> 37:19.777
...she forgot to send me the address, so...

37:19.877 --> 37:23.565
...thought I'd just pull in here and...

37:24.588 --> 37:27.207
...hopefully she gets back to me.
You wouldn't...

37:27.307 --> 37:29.740
...happen to know where it is, would you?

37:29.840 --> 37:34.357
- Fight Valley?
- Yep. Good ol' Fight Valley.

37:34.457 --> 37:38.128
- Nah, I'm good.
- So you can't help me?

37:38.228 --> 37:40.364
- Hey.
- Nah, I said I'm good.

37:40.464 --> 37:42.432
- Yo, I could help you.
- You can?

37:42.532 --> 37:47.571
Yeah. I can help you walk your pretty
ass the fuck up out of here, bitch.

37:47.671 --> 37:49.550
For a small fee though. See here?

37:49.650 --> 37:52.408
You don't pay to get in,
you gotta pay to get out.

37:52.508 --> 37:54.378
- That's right.
- Look, I was not trying to...

37:54.478 --> 37:56.846
I don't give a shit
what you was trying to do.

37:56.946 --> 38:00.917
Just don't do it here. Got it?
Now get the fuck up out of here.

38:01.017 --> 38:04.788
Ah, don't touch me. What's your problem?

38:05.188 --> 38:07.076
You say something?

38:07.492 --> 38:09.042
No.

38:12.295 --> 38:15.747
Oh, my God. What's that?

38:17.801 --> 38:19.016
Fear?

38:20.370 --> 38:22.206
I, um...

38:22.306 --> 38:25.375
I'm sorry, I don't want any problems.

38:25.475 --> 38:28.546
- Actually, no, I was just, um...
- Leaving. She was just leaving.

38:28.646 --> 38:32.615
Yo, Gracey, it's cool.
She just got lost, she's with us.

38:32.715 --> 38:35.689
- I thought you were in bed.
- Move your ass.

38:35.789 --> 38:38.756
- You better put a chain on your poodle.
- Fuck you, Gracey.

38:38.856 --> 38:39.857
Yo sis, you good?

38:39.957 --> 38:43.186
Yeah, you know me.
I can handle my own, big bro.

38:47.831 --> 38:52.502
You have got to learn proper hood protocol
if you're gonna go snooping around.

38:52.602 --> 38:55.351
And the first rule is you don't go out alone.

38:55.451 --> 38:57.545
Not after seven...

38:58.045 --> 39:00.304
...and certainly not in the Valley.

39:01.009 --> 39:03.513
- How'd you know where I was?
- Actually I didn't.

39:03.613 --> 39:07.114
I came to see Neeko, you just got lucky.

39:07.383 --> 39:09.353
- Neeko?
- My brother.

39:09.453 --> 39:11.475
He works down in the Valley at Jabs' gym.

39:11.575 --> 39:13.103
Oh.

39:14.257 --> 39:16.772
So are you like your sister?

39:17.627 --> 39:19.511
What do you mean?

39:21.665 --> 39:25.516
I mean, are you like your sister?

39:26.370 --> 39:28.201
A lesbian?

39:28.301 --> 39:30.207
No, definitely not.

39:31.807 --> 39:37.380
- Have you ever been kissed by a girl?
- What? Ew! No.

39:38.992 --> 39:42.953
I was the same way
and then I was kissed by a girl...

39:43.053 --> 39:46.190
...and I gotta tell you, it's, uh...

39:46.290 --> 39:49.302
- What?
- Well, I don't know...

39:49.402 --> 39:52.242
...I just never thought the touch...

39:52.342 --> 39:54.468
...of a female's lips...

39:55.048 --> 39:56.983
...would feel so...

39:57.933 --> 40:00.336
- ...incredible.
- Hey, you cool?

40:00.436 --> 40:03.139
- You need to talk to me about anything?
- No, I'm good, Neeko.

40:03.239 --> 40:05.542
Just another night in the hood.

40:05.642 --> 40:08.642
I'll see y'all tomorrow,
I'm taking it down for the night.

40:09.412 --> 40:11.629
I should be going as well.

40:13.943 --> 40:16.014
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

40:19.522 --> 40:21.273
<i>You guys have fun last night?</i>

40:21.373 --> 40:24.026
Oh, yeah. She's becoming quite the Tori.

40:24.126 --> 40:27.542
Really? Like sister, like sister, huh?

40:31.500 --> 40:33.329
Hey, Neeko?

40:34.087 --> 40:36.212
You know about this?

40:36.640 --> 40:38.976
God, I miss her so fuckin' much.

40:39.276 --> 40:43.446
- Wait, what are you talking about?
- Oh, nothing, I'm working on it.

40:43.546 --> 40:45.975
Hold up, come here.

40:46.583 --> 40:51.801
You sure you wanna take this girl in here?
I'm telling you right now, it's a bad idea.

40:52.821 --> 40:55.708
Come here. Rule number one
when we get in there...

40:55.808 --> 40:58.108
...you keep your mouth shut,
I do the talking, okay?

40:58.208 --> 41:01.931
- What, so I'm not allowed to ask questions?
- Let me explain to you how the Valley works.

41:02.031 --> 41:05.257
Those that are from here are entitled
to a certain amount of respect...

41:05.357 --> 41:08.406
...those that aren't are entitled
to a certain amount of ass-whoopin's...

41:08.506 --> 41:13.009
...hence the name knock around girls.
And you my little royal gem, can't fight.

41:13.109 --> 41:16.646
And... you ain't got no ass either.

41:16.746 --> 41:20.674
I mean, like, it's aight,
but it ain't no hood ass, so...

41:20.774 --> 41:24.887
...back to rule number one,
keep your mouth shut.

41:24.987 --> 41:30.564
You know what? I'm getting sick of
this royalty princess shit. It's annoying.

41:30.664 --> 41:34.056
And I thought rule number one
was keeping each other safe.

41:35.164 --> 41:40.600
Exactly, which is why we told you to keep
your mouth shut and you'll be safe.

41:44.008 --> 41:46.248
Ah, shit.

41:49.179 --> 41:51.147
- Mornin', ladies.
- What's up, Jay Jay?

41:51.247 --> 41:53.417
What up, babydoll? What's up, Yanni?

41:53.517 --> 41:55.451
- Where's Stakes at?
- Whoa, slow down.

41:55.551 --> 41:57.871
I'm sorry about your girl. Shit's crazy.

41:57.971 --> 42:02.253
Thanks, I miss her, man.
When's the last time you saw Tori?

42:05.161 --> 42:06.596
Whoa, who are you?

42:06.696 --> 42:10.526
You know who I am,
let me back to see Stakes or Gamble.

42:12.234 --> 42:13.936
Yo.

42:14.036 --> 42:16.972
White girl here to see you.
What's your name again, pretty?

42:17.072 --> 42:18.609
- Tori.
- Lori.

42:18.709 --> 42:21.126
It's Tori, you dumb ass.

42:45.234 --> 42:48.683
It's a white girl, says she got a problem,
she don't know captain.

42:52.241 --> 42:54.710
- What's the problem?
- I need you to get me in.

42:54.810 --> 42:56.612
I wanna fight at the yard.

42:56.712 --> 43:00.750
- Like I said, what's the problem.
- I need money, Stakes, come on.

43:00.850 --> 43:02.952
Ain't that easy unless
you got a serious pro...

43:03.052 --> 43:06.807
I do have a serious fucking problem.
I need money.

43:06.907 --> 43:10.260
Just want to get out of this shithole.
Can you help me or not?

43:10.360 --> 43:12.629
Enough with this
what's your problem bullshit.

43:12.729 --> 43:15.565
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?
You know where the fuck you're at?

43:15.665 --> 43:18.972
You might up missing
around this motherfucker.

43:20.170 --> 43:23.239
Hey, shut the fuck up
with all that loud ass shit.

43:23.939 --> 43:27.243
Who said that? Who the fuck said that?

43:27.343 --> 43:31.081
Tori, sit your whack white ass down
before I put you down, bitch.

43:31.181 --> 43:34.418
And I ain't even in the mood to be
beating on your ass today but I will.

43:34.518 --> 43:36.683
You better believe that shit.

43:37.521 --> 43:41.155
So, who the fuck said it?

43:43.026 --> 43:46.295
Angry white girl lookin' for a fight,
that's every day.

43:46.395 --> 43:49.857
No, no. He's lying. You would remember Tori.

43:49.957 --> 43:52.585
Slow down, ma, I remember you,
that's for sure.

43:52.685 --> 43:55.137
- Okay, alright, let's go.
- Whoa, first you got a nickel bag?

43:55.237 --> 43:57.874
- Fuck you, Jay Jay, let us in.
- Get the food stamps going, you know.

43:57.974 --> 43:59.990
Jay Jay, open the door.

44:07.551 --> 44:10.846
Alright, you guys, stay right here.
Right here.

44:11.754 --> 44:14.123
What did I tell you?
You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

44:14.223 --> 44:16.659
She's not your sister today, got it?
We're cousins.

44:16.759 --> 44:19.255
- I got it.
- Yeah?

44:21.013 --> 44:23.416
Don't look at anyone, not here.

44:28.171 --> 44:30.198
What is this place?

44:30.906 --> 44:34.955
The city therapy center. People
come here to work out their problems.

44:35.055 --> 44:37.514
- It's where fight starters hang out.
- Fight starters?

44:37.614 --> 44:39.818
Yeah, fight starters.
You got a problem with somebody...

44:39.918 --> 44:41.852
...you come here,
you talk to a fight starter.

44:41.952 --> 44:44.302
Tell 'em who you're beefing with
and they set up a fight.

44:44.402 --> 44:47.607
It's a way to earn money
and solve your beef at the same time.

44:47.707 --> 44:50.744
If they think your fight's gonna
bring money, they'll book it.

44:51.144 --> 44:55.980
Or you could just get a fuckin' job.
How do the cops let this happen?

44:56.080 --> 44:57.924
Cash, <i>mija</i>.

45:02.538 --> 45:04.744
What's the problem, ladies?

45:04.974 --> 45:07.843
How you gonna act like you don't know us?
What's the problem?

45:07.943 --> 45:10.727
Tori's dead and you ask
what's the problem? Come on, man.

45:12.015 --> 45:14.751
My bad, you're right.

45:14.851 --> 45:18.721
Look, I didn't mean any disrespect.
I'm really sorry about your girl.

45:18.821 --> 45:22.491
Yeah, Tori was a cool chick.
How you doin' baby, you okay?

45:22.591 --> 45:25.494
Tori was a cool chick?

45:25.594 --> 45:28.631
You say that so easy, man,
that's all you got?

45:29.431 --> 45:31.402
Hold up, who's this?

45:31.502 --> 45:33.770
It's my cousin, she's staying
with me for a couple days.

45:33.870 --> 45:35.372
- And you bring her here?
- What the fuck is your problem?

45:35.472 --> 45:38.042
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You know we don't allow that shit.

45:38.142 --> 45:39.576
I wanna know what happened to Tori.

45:39.676 --> 45:42.212
The cops said she died in a fight,
you control the fights.

45:42.312 --> 45:45.683
Listen, there's fights going all around
the goddamn Valley right now.

45:45.783 --> 45:48.953
Somewhere out in those streets someone's
getting an ass whoopin' right now.

45:49.053 --> 45:51.821
I'm not controlling that, am I?
Listen, I'm really sorry...

45:51.921 --> 45:55.859
No. Tori never, ever fought
without your permission.

45:55.959 --> 45:59.945
And you and I both know there aren't
a lot of girls that can fight like Tori.

46:00.045 --> 46:03.167
So whoever killed her fucked her up bad,
and maybe you didn't control that fight...

46:03.267 --> 46:05.968
- ...but you know who did.
- I don't know.

46:06.068 --> 46:08.267
Bullshit! Don't fuckin' lie to me, Stakes.

46:08.367 --> 46:11.183
I don't know what you think we are,
but I'm a business man...

46:11.283 --> 46:13.492
...and unless you have a problem
with someone in particular...

46:13.592 --> 46:17.296
...I strongly suggest you leave before you
get yourself into a real serious problem...

46:17.396 --> 46:22.134
- ...that you can't control, like right now.
- So what's up? What're you gonna do?

46:22.234 --> 46:24.237
- Get her out of here.
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm staying.

46:24.337 --> 46:26.232
I'm here for this.

46:26.940 --> 46:29.025
You better run, stupid skank.

46:29.125 --> 46:31.673
What is this, Charlie's friggin' Angels?
Get the fuck out of my way...

46:31.773 --> 46:33.812
...you bitches ain't gonna do shit.

46:34.112 --> 46:36.185
Really? In the back?

46:51.563 --> 46:54.395
Take her shirt off,
I wanna see some titties out.

46:57.903 --> 47:00.111
Yeah, I like that shit, yeah.

47:23.829 --> 47:26.132
- Is she okay?
- What's going on?

47:26.232 --> 47:31.505
She's pretty banged up, guys,
but she's Duke, she'll pull through alright.

47:32.245 --> 47:34.504
Girls, what the hell happened in there?

47:40.162 --> 47:42.039
Who the hell are you?

47:43.816 --> 47:46.246
Um, you know Tori Coro?

47:48.454 --> 47:49.922
I'm her sister.

48:04.937 --> 48:06.741
<i>Who said that?</i>

48:07.072 --> 48:09.543
Who the fuck said it?

48:09.643 --> 48:13.112
Tori, sit your whack white ass down
before I push you down, bitch.

48:13.212 --> 48:17.842
And I ain't even in the mood to beat on
your ass today, but I will, believe that.

48:19.151 --> 48:22.047
So who the fuck said it?

48:23.255 --> 48:25.979
- I did.
- You ain't bad enough, bitch.

48:26.079 --> 48:28.673
Isn't there anybody tougher in this place?

48:29.461 --> 48:30.923
Yo!

48:52.218 --> 48:56.689
- Fight Valley, huh?
- Yeah, that's what Duke said she heard.

48:56.789 --> 49:00.112
- She was fighting there?
- Well...

49:00.212 --> 49:02.061
...I suppose it's possible.

49:02.161 --> 49:05.215
But you need to understand, if you're
gonna try to fight in the streets...

49:05.315 --> 49:09.603
...shit gets serious fast.
People get hurt, it's not a game.

49:10.003 --> 49:12.783
- What are you even looking for?
- Well...

49:12.883 --> 49:16.335
...for starters, my sister's killer.

49:18.643 --> 49:22.082
It's that simple? That easy?

49:22.182 --> 49:26.785
Let's say you find the person
that killed your sister, then what?

49:26.885 --> 49:28.914
I would kill them.

49:30.422 --> 49:34.726
Then you're not seeking closure,
you're seeking revenge...

49:34.826 --> 49:37.897
...and there's a big fucking
difference, sweetheart.

49:37.997 --> 49:39.366
I guess I am.

49:39.466 --> 49:41.737
If you don't stop poking your nose around...

49:41.837 --> 49:45.205
...and asking stupid fucking questions
in all the bars around here...

49:45.305 --> 49:48.708
...you're gonna get yourself killed,
do you understand?

49:49.808 --> 49:51.785
I don't think you understand.

49:52.411 --> 49:54.657
Go throw those gloves on over there.

49:56.115 --> 49:58.756
Go, hurry up, get 'em on.

50:11.364 --> 50:13.793
- Got it?
- Yeah.

50:14.401 --> 50:16.260
Hit me.

50:16.368 --> 50:18.796
You want me to hit you?

50:19.204 --> 50:21.307
That's the idea.

50:21.407 --> 50:25.838
It's just so much easier when I'm mad,
this feels awkward.

50:26.646 --> 50:30.221
Somebody just killed your sister.
And you know what?

50:30.321 --> 50:33.586
You're gonna find them
and you know what's gonna happen?

50:34.086 --> 50:37.557
You're gonna get your ass kicked
because you don't know how to fight.

50:37.657 --> 50:41.160
How much madder do you need to get?
Your sister's dead.

50:53.212 --> 50:55.675
Now tell me what's wrong with this picture.

50:56.875 --> 51:00.047
You're on your ass,
that's what's wrong with this picture.

51:01.247 --> 51:04.527
- Damn, you're good.
- Get the fuck up.

51:09.489 --> 51:12.579
I own you. No more midnight strolls...

51:12.679 --> 51:15.485
...no more sticking your face in
every goddamn bar around here...

51:15.585 --> 51:17.953
...and asking your dumb ass questions...

51:18.053 --> 51:22.500
...until I say you're ready.

51:24.270 --> 51:26.473
Are you gonna train me to fight?

51:28.273 --> 51:30.829
No, I'm gonna train you to survive.

51:38.685 --> 51:41.698
Stay with me, good job.

51:43.789 --> 51:45.632
Out and proud, huh?

51:49.094 --> 51:51.164
This isn't even my shirt.

51:52.064 --> 51:54.896
Honey, why don't you go
tell Neeko we need some water.

51:56.336 --> 51:59.204
Get out of my gym.

51:59.304 --> 52:01.306
Why, because of my shirt?

52:01.406 --> 52:04.726
Because you're late.
Look, I didn't even wanna help train you.

52:04.826 --> 52:07.784
I offered to help you so you
wouldn't get yourself fucking killed...

52:07.884 --> 52:12.117
...and you don't even have
the decency to show up on time?

52:12.517 --> 52:15.802
- Listen, wait, there's...
- Get out!

52:41.714 --> 52:46.386
- You got that $10 for me?
- I'm not giving you my money. Excuse me.

52:47.786 --> 52:49.824
Don't touch me.

52:50.924 --> 52:53.794
Now it's $100, bitch.

53:05.505 --> 53:07.540
- Enough, enough!
- Get the fuck off of me.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.919
Get the fuck off my girl.

53:12.044 --> 53:14.090
He's got you, bitch.

53:49.347 --> 53:53.393
You're gonna need
to learn to fight, and fast.

53:56.145 --> 53:58.554
You don't have years and years to wait.

54:00.358 --> 54:02.778
So I'm gonna help you learn to fight.

54:14.340 --> 54:17.276
I am done playing your games.

54:17.376 --> 54:19.479
I have enough shit going on in my own life...

54:19.579 --> 54:22.247
...I don't have time to be
babysitting your ass all the time.

54:22.347 --> 54:25.589
This is your last chance.

54:25.951 --> 54:29.770
Do you want to fight?

54:36.896 --> 54:40.317
Then believe me when I tell you,
you're gonna hurt...

54:40.417 --> 54:45.609
...you're gonna bleed and you're gonna
feel pain like you've never felt before.

54:45.839 --> 54:50.449
You know what, honestly?
You don't even know what hurt is.

54:52.278 --> 54:54.113
I'm ready.

54:54.213 --> 54:57.175
Yeah, well, we'll see...

54:57.275 --> 54:59.283
...but I'm telling you now...

54:59.383 --> 55:01.588
...every time you say no...

55:01.688 --> 55:03.500
...every time you say you can't...

55:03.600 --> 55:07.860
...and every time you stop
because you're out of breath...

55:07.960 --> 55:11.203
...I'm gonna punch you square in the face.

55:13.765 --> 55:18.246
Now in a street fight, you're not gonna
have the luxury of wraps and gloves.

55:21.808 --> 55:24.275
And the first thing everyone tries to do...

55:24.375 --> 55:28.981
...is swing wild for the big knockout punch,
and that's the worst thing you can do.

55:29.081 --> 55:30.949
Really, why?

55:31.049 --> 55:33.285
Let me see you try to knock me out.

55:34.885 --> 55:36.723
I thought you said you were ready.

55:36.823 --> 55:40.008
I am, I just... I don't know, I can't...

55:41.828 --> 55:44.666
What the fuck? What the fuck was that for?

55:44.766 --> 55:49.051
Quit wasting my goddamn time, now get up.

55:49.901 --> 55:51.778
Now hit me.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.015
Again.

55:57.877 --> 56:01.752
With anger, somebody just killed your sister.

56:15.594 --> 56:17.930
That's why it's your biggest mistake.

56:18.030 --> 56:22.006
Because you're a fuckin' rookie,
and any fighter with any experience...

56:22.106 --> 56:26.145
...is gonna pick you apart
like the amateur you are.

56:28.007 --> 56:32.492
You break your hands, you're done.
These are your most valuable weapons.

56:42.554 --> 56:44.363
Drop 'em.

56:47.525 --> 56:50.362
You know, my father taught me
a lot about street fighting.

56:50.462 --> 56:53.930
I remember one day when I was in our garage,
I had my gloves all wrapped up...

56:54.030 --> 56:57.602
...and I was beating away on the heavy
bag and I thought I was so tough...

56:57.802 --> 57:01.373
...and he said to me, "If you're gonna
be punching girls in the streets...

57:01.473 --> 57:04.677
"...then why the hell
are you hitting a soft bag?"

57:04.777 --> 57:07.379
And I had no idea
what he meant at the time...

57:07.479 --> 57:10.650
...but a few years later
it clicked and I realized...

57:10.750 --> 57:15.220
...I didn't need these fancy gloves
and beautiful heavy bags.

57:15.320 --> 57:19.664
I needed to condition
my bare knuckles to break bones.

57:20.826 --> 57:22.833
Now push the car.

57:40.379 --> 57:42.253
I can't.

57:43.415 --> 57:48.745
Everything bends, everything moves,
and everything breaks.

59:00.713 --> 59:03.558
And the last two weeks she's been
having really bad pains in her stomach...

59:03.658 --> 59:05.937
...so I'm just getting a little worried.

59:07.299 --> 59:09.500
Can you show me where it hurts?

59:17.342 --> 59:18.887
Hey.

59:23.899 --> 59:26.092
Hey, guys.

59:26.192 --> 59:29.689
- What do the doctors say?
- Just that, uh...

59:29.789 --> 59:32.969
...she took a lot of trauma
to the head and...

59:33.069 --> 59:36.409
...she has a pretty bad concussion,
she just sleeps.

59:36.795 --> 59:39.072
She's gonna be okay, right?

59:42.934 --> 59:44.810
This is all my fault.

59:46.272 --> 59:49.474
Everyone around me is getting hurt, killed...

59:49.574 --> 59:52.278
Stop it. Not your fault.

59:52.378 --> 59:55.246
She loved Tori very much, okay?

59:55.346 --> 59:57.941
And she was gonna search to the end
of the earth just like you...

59:58.041 --> 01:00:00.151
...to find out who killed her.

01:00:00.251 --> 01:00:02.533
But you just happened to come along.

01:00:03.488 --> 01:00:05.291
Hey, hey.

01:00:05.391 --> 01:00:08.510
- Ow!
- Jesus, what the hell did you do?

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.664
Nothin'.
Jabs is just giving me a few lessons.

01:00:12.764 --> 01:00:16.845
Lessons? Like what are you doing?
Punching walls?

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:22.465
No, I'm pretty sure it was a 2x6
piece of pressure treated wood.

01:00:22.565 --> 01:00:26.145
Wow, you're really doing this, aren't you?

01:00:26.245 --> 01:00:30.116
You know you're just gonna start
more fights, right? More drama.

01:00:30.216 --> 01:00:34.443
That's what they want, it's a business.
I know you don't wanna hear it, Windsor...

01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:37.910
...but you're not gonna...
You're not gonna change anything.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.427
I know this all seems so dramatic to you
because you're new to this lifestyle...

01:00:41.527 --> 01:00:43.852
...we deal with this shit every day.

01:00:43.952 --> 01:00:46.126
And you're not gonna change
anything or anyone.

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:48.875
I'm not looking to change anyone.

01:00:52.537 --> 01:00:54.573
I'm looking to kill someone.

01:01:13.859 --> 01:01:16.177
Remember when we used to run five miles?

01:01:16.277 --> 01:01:18.524
Yeah, but we were 15.

01:01:23.986 --> 01:01:25.708
So do you miss it?

01:01:26.138 --> 01:01:28.840
- Miss what?
- Fighting in the Valley?

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.015
Kicking some ass?

01:01:32.177 --> 01:01:34.226
Careful what you wish for.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.987
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:01:37.699 --> 01:01:40.370
What's Stakes say about working
with the outsiders, Jabs?

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:44.856
It's aight, I don't wanna beat up on
old washed up white chicks anyway.

01:01:44.956 --> 01:01:47.392
You take the one on the right,
I got the two on the left.

01:01:47.492 --> 01:01:49.367
Just like old times.

01:02:05.711 --> 01:02:07.792
You know, I did miss this shit.

01:02:11.016 --> 01:02:13.069
Fuck. Windsor.

01:02:20.792 --> 01:02:23.864
Why does something tell me
this ain't a good thing?

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.990
Whatever happens, stay behind us, Windsor.

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:35.408
You ladies know where
I can find Fight Valley?

01:02:36.308 --> 01:02:37.526
You lost.

01:02:37.626 --> 01:02:41.119
No, I'm not lost, you guys just happen
to be on the wrong side of the tracks.

01:02:41.219 --> 01:02:44.249
No, sweetheart, I mean, you lost.

01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:46.083
How's Dyke?

01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:48.720
It's Duke, and she's fine.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.441
- What can we do for you, Gracey?
- You can't do shit for me, Yanni...

01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:54.676
...so back the hell up. I came to talk to her.

01:02:54.776 --> 01:02:58.696
She ain't got shit to say to you, and you're
on my street right now so you can talk to me.

01:02:58.796 --> 01:03:01.402
- Whatever.
- Don't touch her, Gracey.

01:03:01.502 --> 01:03:02.522
Or what?

01:03:02.622 --> 01:03:06.203
I guess we don't know what
until it happens, now do we?

01:03:06.303 --> 01:03:08.941
Oh, shit, that's my girl.

01:03:09.041 --> 01:03:12.577
See, you're lucky I don't crack you
in your motherfuckin' head right now.

01:03:12.677 --> 01:03:17.615
Yeah, you stand tall even though you
know damn well I'll whoop that ass.

01:03:17.715 --> 01:03:21.253
I'll like that. You rep us well.

01:03:21.353 --> 01:03:23.967
You don't touch her 'cause you know
I'll take that damn weave off your head...

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:27.693
...and strangle you with it. You can
get out of her face and off my street.

01:03:27.793 --> 01:03:30.863
- First off, they're twists, hoe.
- Keep tellin' yourself that.

01:03:30.963 --> 01:03:32.798
- Who are you?
- I'm Duke's cousin.

01:03:32.898 --> 01:03:35.434
- Bullshit, who are you?
- I just told you.

01:03:35.534 --> 01:03:38.804
Lookin' for a fight, Duke's cousin?
What's your name?

01:03:40.404 --> 01:03:43.107
You know what it is. I might be.

01:03:43.207 --> 01:03:45.544
- I got this, Windsor.
- We got a tough girl.

01:03:45.644 --> 01:03:48.815
- What do you know about Tori Coro?
- Never heard of her.

01:03:48.915 --> 01:03:51.017
- Why are you in my face?
- Why are you on my streets?

01:03:51.117 --> 01:03:53.351
I believe it's our street.

01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:58.023
- Looks like we've got ourselves a problem.
- Back the fuck up, Gracey.

01:03:58.673 --> 01:04:02.059
Bitch, back the fuck up,
don't you ever get in my face.

01:04:02.159 --> 01:04:04.395
I told you not to touch her.

01:04:24.183 --> 01:04:28.554
You know Church gonna fuck you up for this.
Out here trying to play captain save-a-hoe.

01:04:28.654 --> 01:04:33.592
You tell Church I said she's
a fucking amateur, any time, anywhere.

01:04:33.692 --> 01:04:36.365
You wanna fight this girl, huh?
You wanna fight this girl?

01:04:36.465 --> 01:04:39.599
Please, my street cred would go down
fuckin' around with that hoe.

01:04:39.699 --> 01:04:44.936
I ain't trying to catch a murder rap and
end up like Tori. Hell no, she ain't worth it.

01:04:45.036 --> 01:04:47.740
You worried about street cred?
I'm right here.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.643
- Can't get no better than me.
- What the fuck did you just say?

01:04:50.743 --> 01:04:54.841
- You know who killed Tori...
- Windsor! Not here, not now.

01:04:56.815 --> 01:05:00.757
You tell Stakes there's
a problem, Gracey. Set it up.

01:05:01.719 --> 01:05:03.267
Walk.

01:05:10.529 --> 01:05:12.654
Set it up, Gracey.

01:05:18.236 --> 01:05:22.778
No, I mean, it wasn't a rape,
she was definitely in a fight.

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:25.574
Well, that's what the cops are for, Windsor.

01:05:25.674 --> 01:05:29.353
<i>Go to the police, tell them
everything you know, okay?</i>

01:05:29.453 --> 01:05:32.116
That's just the thing, I don't know yet.

01:05:32.216 --> 01:05:35.553
I mean, not who anyway.

01:05:35.653 --> 01:05:39.090
But I'm close, I'm close.

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:42.302
- How are you doin'? You okay?
- I'm okay.

01:05:42.402 --> 01:05:45.481
I don't know, look, I just saw Duke
and she doesn't look so good.

01:05:45.581 --> 01:05:47.900
<i>What the hell have you guys
been doin', Windsor?</i>

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.368
<i>You know I can't deal
with this kind of shit right now.</i>

01:05:50.468 --> 01:05:53.005
<i>Dad, everything's gonna be fine,
I promise you.</i>

01:05:53.105 --> 01:05:55.754
<i>I just... I need your support right now.</i>

01:05:57.074 --> 01:06:01.946
Um, Dad, I'm gonna be staying at Jamie's.
I'll give you a call tomorrow?

01:06:02.046 --> 01:06:04.215
Alright, sweetie, bye.

01:06:05.315 --> 01:06:06.985
Bye.

01:06:07.085 --> 01:06:09.184
How's he doin'?

01:06:09.284 --> 01:06:12.995
He's okay.
He just wants this over as bad as I do.

01:06:13.725 --> 01:06:16.361
So what happens when this is all over?

01:06:16.461 --> 01:06:19.665
- What do you mean?
- You goin' home?

01:06:19.765 --> 01:06:24.208
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, that's cool.

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:27.972
What's the saying?

01:06:28.072 --> 01:06:31.650
Once a knock around girl,
always a knock around girl?

01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:34.112
Yeah.

01:07:42.213 --> 01:07:47.018
Jabs, Jabs, listen, I know I owe you money,
I owe almost got it all, I promise.

01:07:47.218 --> 01:07:49.286
You know you're lucky
I don't kick your ass right here.

01:07:49.386 --> 01:07:53.396
Super fuckin' disappointed in you.
You're one of my best damn fighters.

01:07:53.558 --> 01:07:55.994
You're about to pay up right now.

01:07:56.094 --> 01:07:58.806
What do you mean? What do you want me to do?

01:08:01.934 --> 01:08:03.628
Alright.

01:08:08.472 --> 01:08:10.373
What's up? I heard you're looking for Fight Valley?

01:08:10.473 --> 01:08:12.341
- No.
- Get the fuck out of the car.

01:08:12.441 --> 01:08:14.473
- No!
- Get the fuck out of the car.

01:08:14.573 --> 01:08:15.746
No.

01:08:15.846 --> 01:08:18.694
Punk ass sister Tori
would've got out of the car.

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.020
What the fuck did you
just say about my sister?

01:08:41.707 --> 01:08:44.115
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:08:46.377 --> 01:08:50.048
- What the fuck, Jabs?
- You need me for somethin'?

01:08:50.848 --> 01:08:53.051
Get your ass in the car.

01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:55.562
Now.

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:02.149
She's ready, she's good.

01:09:21.011 --> 01:09:23.479
You know, I don't even recognize you.

01:09:24.982 --> 01:09:29.247
You've got all the tools,
the rest is up to you.

01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:34.812
But I want you to keep something in mind.

01:09:35.593 --> 01:09:37.607
What you're about to do...

01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:45.160
...as much as it feels right...

01:09:45.804 --> 01:09:48.078
...could always be wrong too.

01:09:48.941 --> 01:09:52.154
Only two fighters are gonna
walk into that circle.

01:09:53.277 --> 01:09:55.485
One of you has to break...

01:09:56.747 --> 01:09:58.957
...one of you has to lose.

01:10:02.019 --> 01:10:05.040
But no matter how many people
are affected by it...

01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:07.994
...it never stops.

01:10:08.794 --> 01:10:12.998
It just recycles and recycles.

01:10:16.334 --> 01:10:20.343
I'm taking the training wheels off,
you're free to ride.

01:10:24.075 --> 01:10:26.612
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:26.712 --> 01:10:29.614
- You're awake.
- I wanna go home.

01:10:29.714 --> 01:10:33.135
Yeah, you will, you gotta get
a little better first, right?

01:10:33.235 --> 01:10:36.187
Doc said they wanna keep
an eye on her a little bit longer.

01:10:36.287 --> 01:10:39.994
- She tryin' to go home tonight.
- What the hell happened?

01:10:40.094 --> 01:10:44.211
You guys are all so squeaky clean
and I'm laying in this hospital bed.

01:10:44.311 --> 01:10:47.982
- That's 'cause you had to be Duke.
- This isn't over.

01:10:48.082 --> 01:10:50.618
No, Duke, it's over.
You don't even have to be thinking...

01:10:50.718 --> 01:10:52.837
She's right, this isn't over.

01:10:52.937 --> 01:10:55.574
First of all Windsor, none of this
would've happened if you hadn't...

01:10:55.674 --> 01:10:58.844
If what? If someone hadn't killed my sister?

01:10:58.944 --> 01:11:01.184
Like that was my request.

01:11:02.346 --> 01:11:04.349
What would you guys be doing
if I hadn't come here?

01:11:04.449 --> 01:11:06.919
Just forgetting about it? She's gone.

01:11:07.019 --> 01:11:09.501
You need to watch the way you talk to me.

01:11:09.601 --> 01:11:11.957
Duke was almost gone
and you're just gonna stand...

01:11:12.057 --> 01:11:16.271
I'm just gonna what? You're not from here,
you don't know how this works.

01:11:22.933 --> 01:11:24.966
She died at the yard.

01:11:28.106 --> 01:11:29.777
What?

01:11:32.911 --> 01:11:34.119
The yard?

01:11:34.219 --> 01:11:36.781
That's where Stakes
puts on all the big fights.

01:11:36.881 --> 01:11:40.168
Do you mean to tell me you knew
about this the whole time?

01:11:40.268 --> 01:11:43.855
What would you have done if you knew
about this four weeks ago? Huh?

01:11:43.955 --> 01:11:46.792
You would've ran up in there
and got yourself killed.

01:11:46.892 --> 01:11:49.586
I'm not about to have that on my shoulders.

01:11:51.342 --> 01:11:53.371
Who killed her?

01:11:54.883 --> 01:11:56.941
Her name is Church.

01:11:58.303 --> 01:12:00.378
Windsor, wait!

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.483
What the fuck are you talking about, Jabs?

01:12:08.345 --> 01:12:11.036
Please tell me you had nothin'
to do with this.

01:12:17.388 --> 01:12:20.191
You're a piece of shit, you know that?

01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:22.497
If anything happens to that girl...

01:12:22.597 --> 01:12:25.802
...I don't care who you are,
I'm coming after you.

01:12:27.898 --> 01:12:29.334
- Hey.
- Wait, where you going?

01:12:29.434 --> 01:12:31.836
You can't just can't come up in here
like that. What you want?

01:12:31.936 --> 01:12:34.072
- I wanna book a fight.
- Why're you trying to fight?

01:12:34.172 --> 01:12:37.207
I'm trying to make love.
We can combat racism in Camden...

01:12:37.307 --> 01:12:39.010
...roll up a little weed for the three of us.

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:42.635
If this door doesn't open
in three seconds, I'm fighting her.

01:12:42.735 --> 01:12:45.317
Whoa, you gonna fight her?

01:12:45.417 --> 01:12:46.992
Yeah.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.457
Yo, white girl here.

01:12:52.857 --> 01:12:55.093
She don't look happy.

01:12:55.393 --> 01:12:57.963
Look, I've been thinking, right.

01:12:58.063 --> 01:13:01.032
We need to relocate, shit's gettin' hot.

01:13:01.132 --> 01:13:03.608
- Need one more big...
- Hey.

01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:09.341
- Talk.
- That's not the question, asshole.

01:13:09.441 --> 01:13:13.512
- Okay, what's the problem?
- I got the biggest fight in history for you.

01:13:14.812 --> 01:13:17.083
You can retire after this one.

01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:19.157
I'm listening.

01:13:20.619 --> 01:13:22.954
I'm not Duke's cousin.

01:13:23.054 --> 01:13:26.792
- I'm Tori Coro's sister.
- Oh, shit.

01:13:26.892 --> 01:13:29.166
Okay, um...

01:13:30.128 --> 01:13:31.930
I see.

01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:34.399
- Gimme a few days.
- Now.

01:13:34.499 --> 01:13:36.568
It's not that simple, takes time, it takes...

01:13:36.668 --> 01:13:41.981
Now! $50,000 cash
plus $10,000 for the other fighter.

01:13:42.081 --> 01:13:45.577
I gotta check with the other fighters and
see if they're interested in your proposal.

01:13:45.677 --> 01:13:47.913
Plus I gotta have a sit down
with my man, Gamble.

01:13:48.013 --> 01:13:52.183
We sittin' down now. 60 Gs? Take it.

01:13:52.283 --> 01:13:57.005
Tell Church she has 24 hours to make
a decision, or I'm coming for her.

01:13:57.105 --> 01:13:59.275
Consider it done.

01:13:59.375 --> 01:14:02.043
Church? Really?

01:14:02.143 --> 01:14:04.314
You have no idea what you got yourself into.

01:14:04.414 --> 01:14:06.380
Careful, Gracey...

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.132
...the next time I come in here,
I'm comin' for you.

01:14:10.652 --> 01:14:12.495
Let's go.

01:14:15.557 --> 01:14:18.895
- I sure hope you know what you're doin'.
- What the hell did Jabs do to you?

01:14:18.995 --> 01:14:22.521
Look, we know now.
It was Church that killed Tori.

01:14:23.031 --> 01:14:24.813
But she couldn't have done it alone.

01:14:24.913 --> 01:14:28.448
Someone drug her body
into the woods and left her there.

01:14:30.138 --> 01:14:32.607
Fuck, she still could've been alive then.

01:14:32.707 --> 01:14:36.049
Somebody else had to have
been involved, I know that.

01:14:44.119 --> 01:14:46.359
I can't believe this is happening.

01:14:47.088 --> 01:14:50.992
If you ask me, we're still just adding fuel
to the fire, but what the hell do I know?

01:14:51.092 --> 01:14:54.497
No, Yanni, it's called putting the fire out.

01:14:55.197 --> 01:14:57.699
Is that what you still think this is?

01:14:57.799 --> 01:14:59.835
This girl don't get it.

01:15:00.535 --> 01:15:03.172
Either way you look at it,
Windsor, it's a fight.

01:15:03.272 --> 01:15:07.209
And with one fight comes another fight
comes another fight and it's not gonna stop.

01:15:07.309 --> 01:15:10.578
Well, thank you for updating me
on the proper statistics.

01:15:10.678 --> 01:15:12.215
- What's your problem?
- Guys, calm down.

01:15:12.315 --> 01:15:16.181
My problem, since you so respectfully asked,
is that after this fight...

01:15:16.281 --> 01:15:19.323
...you get to go back home to your mansion
and your little Rolls Royce...

01:15:19.423 --> 01:15:21.690
...or whatever bullshit ass
rich people car you have...

01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:23.726
...and we gotta stay here
and clean up your mess.

01:15:23.826 --> 01:15:26.696
- Guys, enough. It's okay.
- Excuse fucking me...

01:15:26.796 --> 01:15:29.931
- ...nobody ever said you had to be my friend.
- Would you guys just stop!

01:15:30.031 --> 01:15:33.569
Oh, no, no, no, no, it's okay,
rich girl finally got somethin' right.

01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:36.898
She's right, I don't have to be her friend
and I don't have to fight her battles...

01:15:36.998 --> 01:15:39.859
...and deal with her bullshit,
and you know what? I'm not going to.

01:15:39.959 --> 01:15:42.577
Let her figure it out for her damn self.

01:15:42.677 --> 01:15:44.543
I'm sorry about Tori.

01:15:50.018 --> 01:15:53.590
Yo. Jamie said she booked that fight.

01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:56.893
Hey, you prepared to carry
that weight on those shoulders?

01:15:56.993 --> 01:15:58.761
I mean, you trained them both.

01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:01.164
Hey, yo!

01:16:01.264 --> 01:16:03.734
Jamie says she booked a fight.

01:16:04.934 --> 01:16:07.383
If I would've known she was gonna
use it for the wrong reasons...

01:16:07.483 --> 01:16:09.425
...I wouldn't have trained her.

01:16:16.127 --> 01:16:18.603
Are you with me, or not?

01:16:19.565 --> 01:16:21.199
- What's up, bitches?
- You're out?

01:16:21.299 --> 01:16:24.288
- They let you out?
- Jabs called...

01:16:24.388 --> 01:16:27.900
- ...you guys don't answer your phones?
- Damn. What'd she say?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.033
- She said the fight's off.
- Bullshit the fight's off.

01:16:36.315 --> 01:16:37.982
I don't get it.

01:16:38.082 --> 01:16:40.783
The invitation said this was the address.

01:16:41.653 --> 01:16:42.788
Yo!

01:16:42.888 --> 01:16:44.904
- Yanni.
- My girl!

01:16:45.004 --> 01:16:48.194
Oh, straight from the bed to the yard,
baby, that's how we do it!

01:16:48.294 --> 01:16:51.901
- They let me out.
- You know I ain't gonna miss this shit.

01:16:52.001 --> 01:16:54.862
I don't know,
you think they're fuckin' with us?

01:16:55.201 --> 01:16:58.470
- Somethin's not right.
- Yo, who's this?

01:17:01.907 --> 01:17:04.186
$60,000 please.

01:17:10.248 --> 01:17:13.101
It better all be there. Get in.

01:17:25.963 --> 01:17:28.667
Okay, listen up.

01:17:28.767 --> 01:17:30.435
Rules.

01:17:30.785 --> 01:17:33.021
Whatever happens, happens.

01:17:33.121 --> 01:17:35.908
This is a fight, deal with it.

01:17:35.988 --> 01:17:39.311
She's gonna fuck you up
and you're gonna fuck her up.

01:17:39.411 --> 01:17:42.715
Now anytime one of you decides
you wanna call for your mommy...

01:17:42.815 --> 01:17:44.916
...you hold your hands up.

01:17:45.016 --> 01:17:49.221
If you opponent claws out,
get the hell off of her, got it?

01:17:49.921 --> 01:17:52.992
Gloves or no gloves?

01:17:53.692 --> 01:17:56.701
Well, alrighty then, let's begin.

01:17:57.363 --> 01:18:01.998
- All you need to think about is Tori.
- Hey, glad you ladies could make it.

01:18:02.098 --> 01:18:04.789
It's gonna be a damn shame.

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:06.421
Fuck this!

01:19:21.246 --> 01:19:25.535
- Neeko, we gotta find the girls.
- Nah, fuck that, you stay right there.

01:19:47.305 --> 01:19:49.629
I'm gonna find out who did it...

01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:52.746
...and I'm gonna take from them
what they took from you.

01:21:11.022 --> 01:21:14.360
Does your little ninja
know the truth yet, Jabs?

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:19.111
I bet you don't tell her how you
help me hide her sister in the woods.

01:21:42.954 --> 01:21:46.024
You have to help me, she's dead.

01:21:47.024 --> 01:21:49.427
Jesus Christ, Church.

01:21:49.527 --> 01:21:53.766
I don't know what's happening.
We just fight and I lose control.

01:21:53.866 --> 01:21:56.735
Please, Jabs, you have to help me.

01:21:56.835 --> 01:21:58.879
I don't know what to do.

01:22:02.441 --> 01:22:06.011
You killed her,
I was just trying to help you.

01:22:06.111 --> 01:22:10.815
Oh, yeah, you helped me all right.
You said, "Let's make it look like a rape."

01:22:10.915 --> 01:22:13.959
I will fucking kill you!

01:22:15.921 --> 01:22:17.463
Jabs?

01:22:20.975 --> 01:22:22.845
I'm sorry.

01:22:23.595 --> 01:22:26.697
- What is it?
- This is a book on profiling.

01:22:26.797 --> 01:22:29.201
You can tell if somebody's
lying to you or not...

01:22:29.301 --> 01:22:33.938
...by analyzing their nonverbals,
their body language, eye contact.

01:22:34.038 --> 01:22:36.678
So I could tell if you're lying or not?

01:22:38.076 --> 01:22:39.670
Yes.

01:23:00.112 --> 01:23:01.800
I want you...

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.707
...to tell my sister...

01:23:06.397 --> 01:23:08.484
...that you're sorry.

01:23:14.596 --> 01:23:16.854
I do every night.
