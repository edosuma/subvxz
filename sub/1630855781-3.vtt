00:08.200 --> 00:09.520
Hey!

00:09.520 --> 00:11.080
I haven't seen you in ages!

00:11.080 --> 00:12.680
Oh my God!

00:12.680 --> 00:14.040
Do I have to go?

00:14.040 --> 00:16.120
Camp's only for a couple of nights.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.640
And you're with all your schoolmates.
It'll be fun.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.959
You sure you don't want
to bring the special pants?

00:20.959 --> 00:24.360
Sh. No. It hasn't happened for ages, okay.

00:24.959 --> 00:25.920
I'm going now.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.200
Have fun, Rubes!

00:28.200 --> 00:29.160
Love you.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.119
- What is she wearing?
-"Love you!"

00:31.119 --> 00:32.040
She stinks.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.280
Been to the charity shop again, Ruby?

00:34.280 --> 00:36.000
Ew!

00:38.120 --> 00:42.120
Ruby, this is Sarah. She's new.
I want you to look after her, please.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.040
Hi.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.640
- Hi.
- Come on.

00:48.879 --> 00:51.960
- Which bunk do you want?
- This one looks good.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.360
Ew. Can anyone smell something bad?

00:55.360 --> 00:57.279
- It's just Ruby Matthews.
- Yeah.

00:57.279 --> 00:59.160
Poor people always stink.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.320
Who was that?

01:03.839 --> 01:07.039
That's Darla.
She doesn't let anyone into her group.

01:07.039 --> 01:09.040
She seems unpleasant.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.360
Hey. Do you wanna have
a burpin' competition?

01:12.360 --> 01:14.479

01:44.320 --> 01:45.920
Did you wet the bed?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.199
No. I spilled some water.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.399
I've got some spare pajamas.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.280
Please don't tell anyone.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.320
I won't.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.040
Did you clean, Mum?

02:41.040 --> 02:44.120
- No, I think Joanna did.
- Oh.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.560
Um...

02:45.560 --> 02:49.200
Have you seen
my bright green dress, darling?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.120
No.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.080
Um... I've gotta go.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.760
- I'm not gonna be back till late tonight.
- All right. Well, have fun.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.920
- Thanks.
- Ah!

03:05.360 --> 03:07.799
- See ya.
- Where are you off to looking all fancy?

03:09.120 --> 03:11.519
I'm going to a queer night later
with a friend.

03:11.519 --> 03:12.679
- I'm his wingman.
- Hmm!

03:12.679 --> 03:14.440
What do you think?

03:14.440 --> 03:15.760
Come here.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.280
Oh...

03:20.720 --> 03:21.880
- I don't--
- A bit of eyeliner.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.799
- Okay. Uh...
- Lovely. And now the other side.

03:24.799 --> 03:27.239
- Ah! Oh! Yeah, that's in my eye.
- There we are.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.440
- Now you're perfect.
- Really?

03:30.440 --> 03:32.280
Great. Thank you.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.239
- You're welcome.
- See you later.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.720
Oh,

03:38.600 --> 03:40.799
- Can I have my dress, please?
- What dress?

03:41.399 --> 03:44.519
- The one you're wearing.
- It was on the drying rack.

03:45.760 --> 03:49.920
There was a scarf on the drying rack too.
White with flowers.

03:52.239 --> 03:55.079
Are you gonna thank me
for, uh... the cleaning?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.160
Thank you for cleaning.
And for stealing my clothes.

03:59.160 --> 04:04.040
Oh, I've got this baby group thing.
Do you want to come with me?

04:04.040 --> 04:08.000
Um... No. I'm good.
I think I'm just gonna hang out here.

04:09.359 --> 04:11.959
What's that creepy tree house all about?

04:12.600 --> 04:15.280
My ex built it. Never really liked it.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.360
The ex that's not Joy's father?

04:19.399 --> 04:21.360
You can do your own washing later
if you want.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.920
- Hey.
- <i>Are you on your way?</i>

04:28.920 --> 04:31.080
- I need help.
<i>- With what?</i>

04:31.080 --> 04:32.880
Decidin' what to wear.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.440
I've got too many options.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.760
I've confused myself,
and I'm in fashion hell.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.960
But, dude, it's... it's only two o'clock.
What's the big rush?

04:39.960 --> 04:44.760
Otis, this is my first
proper gay night out.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.760
It is a big deal, and I must prepare!

04:47.760 --> 04:49.640
I know it's a big deal.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.720
<i>I just have to go to Ruby's first.</i>

04:52.479 --> 04:53.960
Does Maeve know you're hangin' out?

04:53.960 --> 04:56.880
We're not hangin' out.
She's helping with my campaign.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.960
And, no, Maeve doesn't know.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.919
<i>- I told you we had a fight.
- </i>  Is she still not talkin' to you?

05:01.919 --> 05:03.240
Uh... We...

05:03.240 --> 05:06.479
I don't know if she's not talking to me,
but I'm not talking to her.

05:06.479 --> 05:09.760
<i>- We're not even officially together, so...</i>
- What time are you gonna get here?

05:10.599 --> 05:11.880
I don't know, like...

05:12.400 --> 05:13.599
- Seven-ish.
- Seven?

05:14.240 --> 05:17.640
Otis, I can't glam myself alone
for five hours.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.400
Well, I'll be there as soon as I can.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.640
You--

05:22.599 --> 05:23.520
No!

05:23.520 --> 05:24.560
No...

05:24.560 --> 05:26.640
Go, go that way!

05:26.760 --> 05:30.400
- Molloy hasn't read your chapter?
- No, I haven't heard anything.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.240
I'd ask him what he thinks.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.359
No. I don't wanna seem desperate.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.000
You've gotta stop
being so meek and British.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.080
You're in America now.
You can ask for what you want.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.000
Mm-hmm. Really?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.800
Guys, I got the internship.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.520
Molloy just called me to his office.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.599
I'm going with him
to this book launch next week,

05:48.599 --> 05:50.960
where he's gonna introduce me
to his publisher.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.000
- Can you believe it?
- Wow.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.160
Congratulations.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.919
Yeah. Congrats, that's amazing.

05:55.919 --> 05:59.039
I gotta go call my mom.
She's gonna lose her shit!

06:07.320 --> 06:08.640
Are you okay?

06:10.400 --> 06:12.599
Yeah. How about you?

06:14.640 --> 06:18.160
It's stupid. I convinced myself
I might actually get it.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.799
I kinda knew she was gonna get it.

06:19.799 --> 06:24.400
Her brother went to Wallace, and, um...
her dad donated a building or somethin'.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.160
Her chapter was about
how hard it is to go to boarding school.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.080
Yeah.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.560
I mean, I... I love Ellen,
but she's never gonna get

06:33.560 --> 06:36.120
why an opportunity like this
is such a big deal for us.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.400
Don't worry about it.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.479
You're an amazing writer,
and there will be other things.

06:53.039 --> 06:54.280
Hello.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.120
- Hiya. I brought cakes.
- Hi.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.919
- What's on them?
- Oh, my squirrels. I miss them so much.

07:15.919 --> 07:19.479
It's Sadie, Simon, Selina, and Bruce,
'cause he looks like my stepdad.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.919
Right. Who are you?

07:21.919 --> 07:23.520
Oh, I'm Aimee. Is Isaac in?

07:23.520 --> 07:25.000
I said it's for me.

07:27.799 --> 07:28.760
- Aimee.
- Hi.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.000
This is my brother, Joe.

07:30.599 --> 07:32.000
- Who is leaving.
- Am I?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.159
Yes. I said
I needed the caravan today, remember?

07:35.159 --> 07:38.120
- Without you playing video games in it.
- Fine.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.599
I'm goin' out.

07:39.599 --> 07:41.479
Cool. Which one's Sadie?

07:43.880 --> 07:44.799
Bye, Isaac.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.479
Goodbye.

07:49.799 --> 07:51.080
Rubes!

07:51.080 --> 07:54.919
The person who I'm not allowed
to mention by name is here.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.960
How have you been?

08:00.599 --> 08:04.359
If you make my daughter cry again,
it will not be good for you.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.159
- Why do you look like a French pirate?
- I'm going to a--

08:09.159 --> 08:11.440
No, I don't have all day.
I'm meeting Anwar and Olivia.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.400
You'll just have to lose the eyeliner
and borrow some of Dad's clothes, okay?

08:15.400 --> 08:16.960
He's helping us with the video.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.039
What video?

08:27.799 --> 08:28.679
Ah, yes!

08:29.280 --> 08:30.919
- <i>Hey, Savior.</i>
- <i>Hi!</i>

08:30.919 --> 08:31.919
Hi!

08:31.919 --> 08:35.039
What are you doing? We're at Roman's.
Do you wanna come over?

08:35.039 --> 08:37.880
<i>I'm gettin' ready
to go to a queer night later.</i>

08:37.880 --> 08:38.919
<i>Emerald City?</i>

08:38.919 --> 08:40.320
<i>- </i>  Yeah.
<i>- We were thinkin' of goin'.</i>

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
- Let's all go together.
- Oh my God!

08:43.000 --> 08:44.039
<i>- Please!</i>
- <i>Come.</i>

08:44.039 --> 08:45.400
- Uh, yeah.
- <i>Please!</i>

08:45.400 --> 08:47.000
- <i>Please!</i>
- Yeah, let's do it.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.560
Do you wanna get ready together?

08:48.560 --> 08:53.000
<i>Well, I'm... I'm waitin'
for Otis to, uh... finish a thing.</i>

08:53.000 --> 08:55.320
<i>- Fine. Tell him he can swing by later.
- Yeah.</i>

08:55.320 --> 08:56.840
<i>Come. It'd be fun.</i>

08:56.840 --> 08:59.680
- <i>You know you want to.</i>
- <i>We'll have a ball.</i>

08:59.680 --> 09:00.600
Yes.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.079
<i>Yes!</i>

09:03.680 --> 09:04.600
Hmm...

09:07.120 --> 09:09.760
Don't you think
I should wear something a bit more hip?

09:10.360 --> 09:14.079
No. This outfit is great.
You could be anyone.

09:14.079 --> 09:18.040
Which means people
can project what they want onto you.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.360
Mmm.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.320
Oh, whoa. I don't need that, do I?

09:32.480 --> 09:34.000
He does need it.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.839
- Your skin looks like an onion, Otis.
- Um...

09:37.839 --> 09:39.520
- Uh...
- Thank you.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.839
Smile.

09:46.079 --> 09:47.240
Ugh...

09:47.240 --> 09:48.160
Okay!

09:48.160 --> 09:49.280
Here?

09:49.280 --> 09:50.600
Yes.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.280
Okay.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.079
And we're rolling.

10:00.880 --> 10:01.720
Should I start?

10:02.560 --> 10:03.400
Yes.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.120
Sorry, I thought you'd say "action."

10:06.280 --> 10:08.160
Oh my God. Dad, please say "action."

10:08.839 --> 10:10.920
And... action.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.640
<i>♪ I am Otis Milburn, and I'm here to say
I'm the best therapist you'll hear today ♪</i>

10:15.640 --> 10:16.600
Cut!

10:17.680 --> 10:19.079
What the hell are you doing?

10:19.079 --> 10:20.720
I'm responding to O's video.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.120
O is dynamic, interesting, and mysterious.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.360
<i>She</i> can rap.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.600
<i>You</i> are none of those things.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.199
So, you need a clean message,

10:31.199 --> 10:34.000
which is why I've made you a script.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.880
Just relax and be normal.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.920
And... action.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.360
Hello there.

10:45.880 --> 10:50.199
I'm the original sex therapist,
formerly practicing at Moordale Secondary.

10:50.959 --> 10:52.440
I'm compassionate and honest.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.400
I will meet you where you're at.
- This is bad.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.680
- Before starting my clinic...
- Why does he look so startled?

10:56.680 --> 10:59.480
- I don't know.
- ...the students were lost and uned---

11:00.680 --> 11:03.680
This isn't working. This is ridiculous.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.320
O is better at this than I am.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.000
She's better at being cool.
She's probably a better therapist.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.320
- Otis. Otis!
- I'm hot.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.880
Otis.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.400
Listen to me.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.640
You know you are good
at talking to people.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.040
You make them feel heard.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.600
Now, forget the camera. Forget the script.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.240
Pretend I'm a client,

11:23.240 --> 11:26.480
and you're telling me
why I should listen to you.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.320
Okay?

11:42.400 --> 11:45.880
Hi, I'm Otis Milburn,
and I'm running for student counselor.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.480
And I am also a bit of a mess.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.800
I am incredibly awkward,
and I struggle with public speaking.

11:54.719 --> 11:56.240
I suffer from anxiety.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.680
And I often don't like
the way my body looks.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.839
I didn't kiss anyone until I was 16,

12:04.839 --> 12:07.520
and I've had problems
wanking and fingering.

12:08.120 --> 12:12.199
I've had my heart broken by people I like,
and I've hurt people who like me.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.959
And I feel misunderstood
a lot of the time.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.440
So...

12:19.600 --> 12:22.640
I am a mess,
but I think all teenagers are,

12:22.640 --> 12:26.360
and I think that's why it's so important
that we can talk.

12:31.959 --> 12:32.800
Yeah?

12:48.320 --> 12:51.079
Welcome to Tickle Tots.

12:51.719 --> 12:53.719
Let's start by going around the room,

12:53.719 --> 12:56.800
saying you and your baby's names,
their age,

12:56.800 --> 12:59.520
and an interesting fact about yourself.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.400
Hello.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.680
My name's Jean, and this is Joy.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.000
She's eight weeks old.

13:13.599 --> 13:14.560
And, um...

13:15.800 --> 13:17.920
Interesting fact, well...

13:17.920 --> 13:19.040
Aah...

13:20.120 --> 13:23.040
I almost died when giving birth.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.360
It happened very suddenly,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.640
and I thought for a very split second

13:27.640 --> 13:31.880
that maybe I wouldn't get to meet my baby
or see my son again.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.800
And, um... well, it was terrifying.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.839
But, um... but we're fine now.

13:37.839 --> 13:42.280
And, uh...
Well, except Joy cries quite a lot.

13:42.280 --> 13:47.440
And I'm a little bit worried
that it might be because of my stress

13:47.440 --> 13:48.599
because of the birth,

13:48.599 --> 13:51.079
and, well, my sister's staying with us,

13:51.079 --> 13:52.839
and I've gone back to work.

13:52.839 --> 13:54.120
Um...

13:54.120 --> 13:56.959
And also, my partner left because he is...

13:58.400 --> 13:59.599
he's not the father.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.719
Sorry, um... it's not very interesting.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.640
Worries, I guess.

14:09.560 --> 14:10.839
Welcome, Jean.

14:10.839 --> 14:12.360
- Mmm.
- Hi, Jean.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.360
Hi, welcome.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.560
Ahem. I'm Geri. This is Marlow.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.000
She's ten weeks old,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
and I like to dip
the entire digestive in the mug

14:26.000 --> 14:29.319
and suck the tea through it
like a biscuity straw.

14:29.319 --> 14:31.400
I'm the same!

14:39.120 --> 14:40.280
Checks first.

14:43.199 --> 14:44.120
Okay.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.880
Now gently lift your left foot
off the clutch.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.680
Left foot. That's your right foot.

14:56.839 --> 14:58.599
Yeah. Mm-hm.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.079
Good. Now, stop.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.520
- Stop!
- You didn't teach me how to stop!

15:14.000 --> 15:16.640
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Adam!
- You didn't tell me how to stop.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.199
This was a mistake.

15:18.199 --> 15:21.079
I am capable of patience.
I am trying to be a better me.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.160
Adam, you're right.
I didn't teach you how to stop.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.400
It's my fault. I am sorry I yelled.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.040
Why do you keep saying sorry?
It's freaking me out.

15:32.719 --> 15:35.680
I'm doing an online course.
It's called <i>Being a Better Man.</i>

15:36.439 --> 15:38.040
It's helping, I think.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.839
Please.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.760
Shall we try again?

15:54.240 --> 15:55.959
Welcome to me humble abode!

15:55.959 --> 15:58.160
Hi! You look amazing!

15:58.160 --> 16:00.599
- Oh, thank you. So do you.
- Thank you.

16:00.599 --> 16:02.079
Make yourself at home.

16:02.079 --> 16:04.560
I forgot to say to bring swimmin' shorts.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.880
But you can borrow some of mine
if you feel like a dip in the pool.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.560
The pool?

16:14.240 --> 16:16.280
Stop it! Oi, oi! Hands up, Savior!

16:16.280 --> 16:18.400
Don't even dare! Don't even dare!

16:18.400 --> 16:20.319
No one's safe. Look.

16:20.319 --> 16:23.640
- I'll get you those shorts now.
- Um... Hold my flippin' glass.

16:24.719 --> 16:26.760
- Are you kiddin'?
- No, he's not.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.880
- Yes, she is!
- No, he is not!

16:28.880 --> 16:30.719
Whoo!

16:36.319 --> 16:38.120
So, you could do sculpture.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.319
Or there's printmaking as well, here.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.760
But it's about finding
what's the right expression for you.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.719
Yeah.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.520
I don't think I get art.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.079
What makes you decide
how to decorate your cakes?

17:00.800 --> 17:04.319
- Dunno, just what I feel on the day.
- Well, that's basically art.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.280
Is that someone's bed?

17:10.440 --> 17:11.280
Yeah.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.520
Yeah, that's Tracey Emin.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.119
It's what her bed looked like
after she'd had a depressive episode.

17:17.720 --> 17:21.119
And then she put it in a gallery.
How badass is that?

17:21.760 --> 17:24.560
And this over here is Ana Mendieta.

17:25.159 --> 17:26.960
She took loads of photographs of herself.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.640
A lot of female artists
like to use self-portraiture.

17:31.399 --> 17:34.440
Maybe it's because other people
don't see them how they really are.

17:36.159 --> 17:37.000
Yeah.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.120
Do you have a camera?

17:46.680 --> 17:50.760
Um... Do you have
any sort of regular income?

17:50.760 --> 17:56.240
Um, I work...
mainly in the wellness industry.

17:56.240 --> 18:00.720
I... I do Reiki,
and, um, I teach reflexology.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.480
And I sold cold press juicers for a bit.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.640
- Oh, okay.
- And these days, I am a nanny.

18:08.159 --> 18:10.640
Oh, I love babies. Babies are the best.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.240
- Oh.
- Uh...

18:12.919 --> 18:17.360
Cool. Okay. So, uh...
we will need to run a... a credit check.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.560
I...

18:18.560 --> 18:22.000
I don't have a... like, a credit... score.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.919
Yeah, I... I've recently just come back
from overseas, so...

18:24.919 --> 18:27.280
- Ah! Whereabouts?
- Oh, well, um... yeah, I...

18:27.280 --> 18:30.640
I've spent a lot of time
in Thailand and Malaysia.

18:30.640 --> 18:35.120
That's so cool. Uh, it's kind of my dream
to go to New Zealand, if I'm honest.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.120
I wanna see where they shot
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i> It's just...

18:38.120 --> 18:39.480
I know it's dumb, but...

18:39.480 --> 18:42.760
"We wants it."

18:42.760 --> 18:44.520
"And we needs it."

18:44.520 --> 18:46.280
"We must have the precious."

18:46.280 --> 18:48.880
It's such a... Ah, it's...

18:48.880 --> 18:53.200
Um. Ahem. Uh, anyway, where was I?
Sorry. Uh, do...

18:53.200 --> 18:55.440
- What sort of, um... assets do you own?
- Uh...

18:56.040 --> 18:59.720
None. In terms of material wealth.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.800
Oh.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.919
Okay, listen. I... Unfortunately,
I think it's pretty unlikely

19:05.919 --> 19:09.200
we're gonna be able to offer you
any kind of loan today, Joanna.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.399
- Can I just get a credit card?
- Absolutely not.

19:12.399 --> 19:13.480
- Right.
- No. But, um...

19:13.480 --> 19:17.480
What I did wonder was
whether or not it would be okay to...

19:19.240 --> 19:20.720
...ask for your number?

19:28.080 --> 19:30.399
Jo? I thought you were staying at home.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.000
Uh, yeah, the, uh...
the bank, uh... they blocked my card.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Fell for one of those
bloody text scam things.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.040
Right.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.960
Are you gonna take me home?

19:42.360 --> 19:43.440
Nice belt.

19:44.399 --> 19:46.720
- I found it on your bedroom floor, so...
- Mm-hmm.

Oh, uh, this is my mate. Dave.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.159
Dave.

20:23.679 --> 20:26.159
Do you take
any prescription medication?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.880
Cipralex. For anxiety.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.960
Are you a smoker?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.600
I had one. Once.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.200
I lost my voice.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.560
Do you have any health issues
in your family?

20:37.360 --> 20:40.520
Blood pressure problems,
heart disease, cancer?

20:40.520 --> 20:42.440
No. My mums are pretty healthy.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.560
I don't know my dad. He was a sperm donor.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.520
Okay, you're all done.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.360
- Was everything all right down there?
- Let's do some blood tests.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.640
And I'm going to refer you
for an ultrasound.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.200
Just to be on the safe side.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.399
Hmm.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.800
Why did you ask about my parents?

21:04.800 --> 21:09.159
Well, some illnesses can be hereditary.

21:20.560 --> 21:24.960
You know, I thought I was gay
for about a week when I was 15.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.640
I saw this film with Clint Eastwood.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.320
I couldn't stop thinking about him
carrying a gun.

21:33.399 --> 21:37.000
Then I realized I just wanted to be
Clint Eastwood, not have sex with him.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.840
Dad, this course you're doing
is making you really weird.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.919
I saw your friend...

21:51.800 --> 21:52.880
Eric at school.

21:54.840 --> 21:58.159
He said you weren't friends anymore.

21:59.399 --> 22:02.320
And I thought
maybe you'd want to talk about it.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.280
I'm okay.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.919
I mean, it was hard.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.159
But it doesn't...

22:16.760 --> 22:18.320
hurt as much as it did.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.439
Also, I'm not gay.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.919
I'm bisexual.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.000
They say Alexander the Great
may have been bisexual.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.080
What is it?

22:42.080 --> 22:44.520
It's a teacher from school
asking me out for dinner.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.600
- A date?
- No. No, just dinner, I think.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.360
She sent you a winky face.
She's asking you on a date.

22:56.159 --> 22:57.080
You should go.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.480
Is your mother seeing anyone?

23:01.399 --> 23:02.600
Um...

23:03.720 --> 23:05.720
She's taking self-defense classes,

23:05.720 --> 23:09.760
and I think she might be...
dating her instructor.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.880
Is it serious?

23:12.520 --> 23:14.240
I think she's seeing a few people.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.960
This is, uh... really good.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.360
I wanna wear this,
but I do want somethin' sparkly.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.880
- Mmm!
- Oh, look who it is! Hey!

23:32.399 --> 23:35.040
- No idea what to wear.
- You'll find something.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.960
What about this?
I reckon it's more you than me anyway.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.320
- Ooh, look at that.
- Ooh!

23:41.360 --> 23:42.800
This could be a vibe.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.800
- Do you want me to help?
- Yeah. Thank you.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.720
- Got it?
- Yeah.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.679
- Stunning.
- Yes!

23:47.679 --> 23:49.840
That was made for you!

23:49.840 --> 23:51.760
- Yes!
- I need a pic of this.

23:51.760 --> 23:52.760
- And pose.
- Oh!

23:52.760 --> 23:53.679
- Mmm!
- And pose.

23:53.679 --> 23:54.960
Oh, you look amazing.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.399
- No, I love it!
- Oh!

23:56.399 --> 23:59.120
Your friend has put up a campaign video.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.800
- Oh, okay!
- He's so cute.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.159
Oh!

24:04.159 --> 24:06.080
How long have you guys been friends?

24:06.080 --> 24:08.399
We've been best friends
since primary school.

24:09.439 --> 24:11.399
You seem really different.

24:11.399 --> 24:12.399
Yeah.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.520
Yeah. No, we are. Uh...

24:15.520 --> 24:19.000
He's always been my person, though.
But I guess...

24:20.720 --> 24:22.080
I don't know. I guess, um...

24:22.800 --> 24:27.360
Sometimes, I feel
like he doesn't entirely get me.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.120
I think that's why
I don't have many straight friends.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.120
Me either. So much emotional labor!

24:33.120 --> 24:34.800
Aah!

24:35.840 --> 24:39.640
I also think sometimes
straight people can just be a bit basic.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.360
Okay, Roman. Let's not be mean.
Otis is Eric's friend.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.080
I was only agreeing with Eric.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.880
Sometimes it's just hard to,
you know, bridge the gap.

24:47.399 --> 24:49.200
Okay, it's getting a bit heavy.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.800
Do you know what we need?
We need some of this.

- Just homework.

25:09.280 --> 25:12.240
- Do you want a snack?
- I'm good. Thanks.

25:12.880 --> 25:16.640
I was gonna do a face mask
and watch a film later. You fancy it?

25:17.159 --> 25:18.640
No, thanks. I'm good.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.439
Okay.

25:37.080 --> 25:38.439
I can't see anything.

25:38.439 --> 25:39.720
The lens cap's still on.

25:40.720 --> 25:41.600
Oh.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.360
If you move that front dial to the left,
then it will focus.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
The numbers behind that are the aperture.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.040
The lower the number,
the more light you let in.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.800
And there's a self-timer
you can use as well.

26:01.399 --> 26:02.960
Oh, right. Okay. Um...

26:08.199 --> 26:10.159
- Are these for your portfolio?
- Yeah.

26:10.159 --> 26:11.240
Can I?

26:12.880 --> 26:13.720
Yeah, sure.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.800
We moved around a lot
when we were younger.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.480
- Have you always lived with your brother?
- Yeah.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.159
- I wanna move out on my own soon, though.
- Oh.

26:27.159 --> 26:30.240
Maybe get a teaching degree
and earn a bit of money that way.

26:31.159 --> 26:34.679
But I just don't know
how to talk to him about it yet.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.919
I thought you did art
just 'cause you liked painting.

26:43.439 --> 26:46.240
- This looks very personal.
- Ah...

26:46.960 --> 26:48.159
Yeah, I... I suppose...

26:49.320 --> 26:51.800
I've had a lot of anger
growing up in care.

26:52.520 --> 26:56.000
And painting helped me feel less, um...

26:58.120 --> 26:59.120
sad.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.760
Yeah.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.679
When I got sad as a kid,

27:04.679 --> 27:07.880
I'd bury all my mum's jewelry
in the garden so she couldn't find it.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.000
- It's probably still there, actually.
- You're a maverick.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.399
What does that mean?

27:14.399 --> 27:16.760
It means that you don't think
like other people.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.439
I thought that was being stupid.

27:18.439 --> 27:21.679
No, no, no.
It means that you're your own person.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.040
I'm home.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.000
Oh.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.960
Do you have any cakes left?

27:36.960 --> 27:39.800
Yeah, loads. Have 'em all.
Um... I've gotta go.

27:40.399 --> 27:41.880
So... right now.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.040
Have a nice evening!

27:44.840 --> 27:47.520
- Don't forget the camera.
- Oh, thank you.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.720
- Bye!
- Bye.

27:53.159 --> 27:55.080
Bit of a strange fish, that one.

27:55.960 --> 27:59.159
<i>I've had problems wanking and fingering.
I've had my heart broken...</i>

27:59.159 --> 28:03.320

28:06.640 --> 28:10.320

28:10.320 --> 28:12.679

28:16.120 --> 28:18.679

You guys were great.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.240
It's fine.

28:24.199 --> 28:27.000
Righty-ho. I'm gonna get the nachos ready.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.919

<i>Third Wives of Miami</i> tonight.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.240
I thought you were seeing
Anwar and Olivia tonight?

28:36.240 --> 28:40.080
Oh, our plans changed.
Didn't you have somewhere to be tonight?

28:40.080 --> 28:43.040
Yeah, I need to find out where I'm going.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.240
- I love you guys so much.
- Cheers.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.639

29:55.480 --> 29:56.919
You so got uninvited.

29:57.600 --> 30:01.199
Eric's friends with the popular kids now,
and he doesn't want you tagging along.

30:02.840 --> 30:03.879
That's harsh.

30:05.159 --> 30:06.199
Even for you.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.320
Oh my God.
No, you're actually upset. Okay.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.280
Do you wanna stay
for nachos with me and my dad?

30:15.760 --> 30:16.679
Uh...

30:17.240 --> 30:20.560
I don't know, Ruby. I'm with Maeve now.
Kind of. It's a bit weird.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.480
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.679
Just that you're suddenly being
very nice to me.

30:26.679 --> 30:29.560
- And you're helping me with this campaign.
- Don't flatter yourself.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.159
If you must know,
I went to primary school with O.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.080
Except she was called Sarah Owen
back then.

30:36.639 --> 30:41.080
Never have I ever
kissed Henry Gold with tongues.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.040
New girl. Your go.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.240
Can you not speak or something?

30:54.080 --> 30:56.360
Never have I ever

30:57.760 --> 30:59.399
wet the bed on school camp.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.360
Oh my God. No.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.199
Ruby, you need to drink.

31:03.199 --> 31:06.159
She put the stinky piss sheets
under her mattress.

31:06.159 --> 31:08.720
- Oh my God!
- I always knew she was a bed wetter!

31:08.720 --> 31:10.679
- That's why she stinks.
- Pisser!

31:10.679 --> 31:12.480
- Please stop!
- Bed wetter!

31:12.480 --> 31:13.840
- Bed wetter!
- Bed wetter!

31:13.840 --> 31:17.040
Bed wetter! Bed wetter!
Bed wetter! Bed wetter!

31:17.040 --> 31:19.800
They put the video online,
so everyone found out.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.000
Ruby, that's awful.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.159
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Bed wetter! Bed wetter!</i>

31:23.679 --> 31:25.800
You know, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

31:26.320 --> 31:29.439
And being bullied can easily contribute
to nocturnal enuresis.

31:29.439 --> 31:31.280
- Ugh, I don't need you to go...
- It's a really...

31:31.280 --> 31:33.560
...into therapist mode right now, Otis.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.439
I saw a specialist. Got it under control.

31:36.439 --> 31:37.399
Obviously.

31:37.399 --> 31:39.439
Well, I'm glad you spoke with someone.

31:42.280 --> 31:46.320
I mean, primary school was... hell, anyway.

31:46.840 --> 31:51.080
I was the weird girl with the weird
parents whose mum made her clothes,

31:51.080 --> 31:54.639
I didn't think it could get worse.
And then this happened.

31:55.840 --> 32:00.480
I ate lunch every day
in the toilets by myself till I left.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.439
Because nobody wants
to sit with the bed wetter.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.240
Ruby. That's not fair.

32:07.240 --> 32:10.760
No, don't. Please don't look at me
like that with the pity eyes.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.199
- I will throw up.
- Okay.

32:13.719 --> 32:16.120
Looking at you with normal eyes.

32:18.679 --> 32:20.360
So this is about revenge.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.199
I just think it's rich
that she's walking around,

32:25.199 --> 32:28.760
preaching kindness,
and pretending she doesn't know who I am.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.120
Rubes, I feel a bit dizzy. Uh...
I think I'm gonna have to lie down.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.520
- Okay, Dad. Do you want some help?
- No. I'm okay.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.639
Uh, nachos are in the oven.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.760
Look, it's fine if you can't stay.
I get it's awkward with Maeve.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.320
No, I want to.

33:00.120 --> 33:03.040
Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

33:04.360 --> 33:06.000
My mom and dad are so happy.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.719
Writing's what I've always wanted to do
ever since I was a kid,

33:09.719 --> 33:11.560
and used to put on plays and stuff.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.919
Yeah.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.840
This is huge.

33:16.840 --> 33:20.120
He knows everyone. It will definitely
help me get into Wallace.

33:20.639 --> 33:24.919
I had a pretty good chance,
but now I probably will, you know?

33:25.520 --> 33:27.919
I'm so lucky. I am so lucky.

- See ya.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.799
And then t-here were two.

34:17.040 --> 34:20.080
So I was thinking
we could get a head start on trigonometry?

34:20.080 --> 34:23.040
- Particularly cofunctioning identities.
- You're so smart.

34:24.319 --> 34:27.520

but I... thought I'd say it.

34:28.040 --> 34:31.000

You love maths, and I love maths.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.639

34:34.440 --> 34:36.960
Sorry, Um... I know that's a lot,

34:36.960 --> 34:41.360
but I was talking to my dad about you,
and he said I should say how I feel.

34:41.360 --> 34:44.000
- You spoke to your dad about me?
- I tell him everything.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.440
We're close,
but he's not been well recently, um...

34:47.799 --> 34:51.600
He had a stroke,
so he can't speak very well.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.000
Can I... can I kiss you?

34:59.480 --> 35:00.400

37:41.799 --> 37:43.000
Well, I...

37:43.000 --> 37:46.160
<i>- </i>  [woman 2] <i>He said, "I want Margerita!"
- </i>  I'm glad he's moving on.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.920
<i>He's busy training,
and I'm really busy with...</i>

37:56.920 --> 38:00.440
So, Magdalena has just filed for divorce,

38:00.440 --> 38:04.240
and she's gotten highlights,
which have been very controversial.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.600
<i>But I've had a few people
looking through the window.</i>

38:06.600 --> 38:09.040
<i>I think I'm gonna do a launch party.</i>

38:09.040 --> 38:11.880
You know, if... if people found out
what O did to you,

38:11.880 --> 38:13.520
I don't think they'd vote for her.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.280
You cannot tell anyone.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.839
- I just thought you wanted to win.
- Not like this.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.640
I'm a different person now.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.680
Yeah, you are. What happened?

38:25.359 --> 38:26.600
Nothing happened.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.760
Just learned to protect myself
and stop letting my mum dress me.

38:34.359 --> 38:37.240
<i>...husband was born again,
and already being humiliated.</i>

38:37.240 --> 38:38.440
<i>Hey!</i>

38:41.080 --> 38:42.760
Ahem.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.000
So, what's happened with you and Maeve?

38:47.000 --> 38:47.920
Nothing.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.760
She's just over there
doing all these new things,

38:52.760 --> 38:54.839
and meeting all these new people, and...

38:56.080 --> 38:58.160
I sometimes feel
like I'm getting left behind.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.520
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

39:03.520 --> 39:06.400
I wasn't going to hang out
with Anwar and Olivia this evening.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.880
They have made loads of new friends,

39:10.960 --> 39:13.040
and they don't have time to see me.

39:17.839 --> 39:19.080
I'm glad we're hanging out.

39:19.880 --> 39:23.520
Stop talking, Otis.
You're ruining the episode.

39:35.839 --> 39:37.760
Come in.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.240
- Hi.
- Hi, Maeve.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.720
Can I help you with something?

39:45.760 --> 39:49.520
Yeah, um... I was wondering if you've had
a chance to read my new chapter yet.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.640
Yeah, I have.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.359
Okay, great. Um, what did you think?

39:57.640 --> 40:01.160
I thought it was a little soapy.
I could see what you were doing.

40:01.160 --> 40:04.839
It was like a Victorian novel
set in a modern-day trailer park,

40:04.839 --> 40:09.319
but it was underdeveloped,
and the characters weren't fully realized.

40:09.839 --> 40:10.799
Oh, okay.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.359
I thought I'd taken on your feedback.

40:13.359 --> 40:16.120
Trying to write from a more honest place.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.480
What did Ellen do differently?

40:29.720 --> 40:32.080
She... she just told us
she got the internship.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.960
I think she showed great potential.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.680
Why? Do you disagree with my choice?

40:39.680 --> 40:42.839
Do you somehow feel
like <i>you</i> are more deserving?

40:42.839 --> 40:45.920
No! No. I just...

40:46.560 --> 40:49.680
I'd like to know what I can do
to be better and get ahead.

40:51.480 --> 40:54.440
Well, after reading that,
and your Brontë piece,

40:55.680 --> 40:58.200
I'm not sure
you're cut out to be a writer.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.960
We have very high standards here.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.720
And like I said in our first class,

41:05.319 --> 41:07.359
writing is a very tough business,

41:07.359 --> 41:11.720
so I wouldn't want you
to... get your hopes up.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.359
Okay.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.799
Thanks for reading it.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.480
Okay.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.920
- Maeve?
- Yeah?

41:37.920 --> 41:41.280
They wanna see you at the front office.
Someone from the UK is on the phone.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.240

46:27.160 --> 46:29.120
I had it done last year.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.000
Honestly, it was
the best decision I've ever made.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.879
I finally just feel like myself.

46:35.760 --> 46:39.080
I've been on the waiting list

46:39.080 --> 46:41.839
for three years, almost.

46:41.839 --> 46:44.920
And, I dunno,
I'm hoping it's not much longer.

46:44.920 --> 46:48.640
I saw a private consultant
to get my T because I couldn't wait.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.920
Things are really bad right now.

46:50.920 --> 46:53.560
People wait up to five years
for their first appointment,

46:53.560 --> 46:57.799
and then it can be another few years
on top of that to get your surgery.

46:57.799 --> 47:00.520

that you're feeling left behind.

48:40.760 --> 48:41.680
I will.

48:44.080 --> 48:45.680
