WEBVTT

00:07.005 --> 00:09.603
If I have not returned in an hour,
you must fetch the police.

00:10.007 --> 00:11.447
Edmund!

00:12.567 --> 00:15.005
Don't fret, Effie, my dear.
All will be well.

00:15.007 --> 00:17.545
But we must get to the bottom of
this dark and queer business,

00:17.577 --> 00:18.977
no matter what the cost.

00:32.906 --> 00:34.544
Mrs Gillyflower!

00:34.546 --> 00:38.424
We have come about your husband,
my dear. A tragedy.

00:38.451 --> 00:39.849
My husband?

00:39.881 --> 00:42.199
Your... late husband.

00:42.201 --> 00:46.641
There must be some mistake.
My husband is quite well.

00:54.681 --> 00:56.921
We are so very sorry for your loss.

01:00.641 --> 01:03.481
Hell fire! That's put me
right off me mash.

01:05.521 --> 01:07.119
Another one! Another?

01:07.121 --> 01:10.599
He's not the first I've had in 'ere
looking like that.

01:10.601 --> 01:14.119
The Crimson Horror!
That's what they're calling it!

01:14.121 --> 01:17.559
I have no interest in the deplorable
excesses of the penny-dreadfuls.

01:17.561 --> 01:20.481
Hey, hey.
Payment in advance, flower.

01:25.641 --> 01:27.599
Taking a big risk, you see, I am.

01:27.601 --> 01:30.879
They'd have my vitals
for fiddle-strings if they knew

01:30.881 --> 01:34.919
I'd let you come to have a look at
one of their precious stiffs.

01:34.921 --> 01:37.359
This "stiff" is my brother.

01:37.361 --> 01:40.079
I've come up from London
to bring him home.

01:40.081 --> 01:41.559
Oh, aye?

01:41.561 --> 01:43.559
Thank you for agreeing to
this meeting,

01:43.561 --> 01:46.999
I'm told you are the investigator to
see if there are strange goings-on.

01:47.001 --> 01:48.959
I read of your brother's death.

01:48.961 --> 01:51.759
Another victim of
the Crimson Horror, I believe?

01:51.761 --> 01:53.159
So it is claimed.

01:53.161 --> 01:57.759
He was a newspaper man. He and a
young woman were working undercover.

01:57.761 --> 02:01.679
Tell me, Madame,
do you know what an optogram is?

02:01.681 --> 02:04.359
It is a silly superstition, sir.

02:04.361 --> 02:08.201
The belief that the eye can retain
an image of the last thing it sees.

02:24.481 --> 02:25.719
Good grief!

02:25.721 --> 02:26.881
Oh, God!

02:34.561 --> 02:36.679
Well, I'll be blowed!

02:36.681 --> 02:40.321
I think, Madame, that we'd better
make plans to head North!

02:48.838 --> 03:21.660

03:22.481 --> 03:25.679
According to my research,
Sweetville's proprietor

03:25.681 --> 03:28.879
holds recruitment drives
for her little community.

03:28.881 --> 03:32.559
She is only interested in
the fittest and the most beautiful.

03:32.561 --> 03:35.001
You may rely on me, ma'am.

03:36.801 --> 03:39.041
I was, in fact, speaking to Jenny.

03:40.881 --> 03:42.481
Jenny?

03:44.441 --> 03:48.359
If this weak and fleshy boy
is to represent us,

03:48.361 --> 03:51.839
I strongly recommend
the issuing of scissor grenades,

03:51.841 --> 03:55.439
limbo vapour
and triple-blast brain splitters.

03:55.441 --> 03:57.079
What for?

03:57.081 --> 04:03.601
Just generally.
Remember, we are going to the North.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.479
Bradford,
that Babylon for the Moderns,

04:11.481 --> 04:14.279
with its crystal light
and its glitter.

04:14.281 --> 04:19.079
All aswarm with the wretched
ruins of humanity.

04:19.081 --> 04:23.201
Men and women
crushed by the devil's juggernaut!

04:25.161 --> 04:29.679
And moral turpitude can destroy
the most delicate of lives.

04:29.681 --> 04:33.321
Believe me, I know. I know.

04:35.721 --> 04:37.719
My own daughter.

04:37.721 --> 04:42.001
Blinded in a drunken rage by
my late husband!

04:44.281 --> 04:50.841
Her once-beautiful eyes,
pale and white as mistletoe berries.

04:51.921 --> 04:55.159
And what, my friends, is your story?

04:55.161 --> 04:58.999
Will you be found wanting
when the End of Days is come,

04:59.001 --> 05:02.919
when judgement rains down
upon us all?

05:02.921 --> 05:07.601
Or will you be preserved against
the coming apocalypse?

05:08.721 --> 05:13.599
Do not despair! I offer a way out!

05:13.601 --> 05:17.241
There is a different path!
Sweetville!

05:24.521 --> 05:30.601
Join us! Join us in
this shining city on the hill!

05:32.121 --> 05:38.959
♪ Bring me my bow of burning gold

05:38.961 --> 05:44.761
♪ Bring me my arrows of desire... ♪

05:47.321 --> 05:49.079
You wish to join us, my dear?

05:49.081 --> 05:51.759
If it's all the same
with you, ma'am.

05:51.761 --> 05:54.121
Oh, yes, dear. You'll do very nicely.

05:58.281 --> 06:01.079
If our strategy is to succeed,
Jenny will infiltrate

06:01.081 --> 06:03.839
deep into the black heart
of this place.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.399
And how will she locate the Doctor?

06:05.401 --> 06:09.119
To find him, she needs only to
ignore all keep-out signs,

06:09.121 --> 06:11.279
go through every locked door,

06:11.281 --> 06:15.199
and run towards any form of danger
that presents itself.

06:15.201 --> 06:17.239
Business as usual, then.

06:17.241 --> 06:18.841
Business as usual.

06:53.441 --> 06:57.441
Did you think I'd forgotten you,
dear monster? Hmm?

07:17.241 --> 07:20.159
I have travelled from London
expressly to see Madame Vastra.

07:20.161 --> 07:23.399
If you'd be so kind as
to announce me, my good man.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.441
Whom should I say is calling?

07:33.001 --> 07:37.119
It asked for permission to enter
and then it fell over.

07:37.121 --> 07:39.359
What are we to make of it?

07:39.361 --> 07:43.599
I imagine Mr Thursday wants to know
what progress we are making.

07:43.601 --> 07:45.359
The question is,

07:45.361 --> 07:49.519
how did the Doctor's image come to
be preserved on a dead man's eye?

07:49.521 --> 07:51.799
It is a scientific impossibility.

07:51.801 --> 07:53.839
I wonder how Jenny is getting on.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.439
If she hasn't made contact
by nightfall,

07:56.441 --> 08:00.199
I suggest a massive frontal
assault on the factory, Madame.

08:00.201 --> 08:03.519
Casualties can be kept to perhaps
as little as 80%.

08:03.521 --> 08:07.479
I think there may be subtler ways
of proceeding, Strax.

08:07.481 --> 08:09.521
Suit yourself.

08:24.521 --> 08:26.599
I'm dead nervous, aren't you?

08:26.601 --> 08:30.679
They have to be sure, you see.
Only the best for Sweetville!

08:30.681 --> 08:32.841
I hope me teeth don't let me down.

08:34.721 --> 08:36.078
I'm Abigail.

08:36.081 --> 08:37.719
Pleased to meet you.

08:37.721 --> 08:40.359
You're not local, are you?
Nah. Up from London.

08:40.361 --> 08:42.198
Different here, I bet.

08:42.201 --> 08:44.481
Oh, yeah!
Like a bleedin' horse-market.

08:46.681 --> 08:48.919
Do you know anyone
who's come to live here?

08:48.921 --> 08:51.199
In Sweetville, I mean.

08:51.201 --> 08:53.719
I... I had a pal who come here
three month back.

08:53.721 --> 08:56.359
She wrote to tell me
how perfect it all were.

08:56.361 --> 08:59.879
Funny, though. I've not heard
a peep from her since.

08:59.881 --> 09:01.559
Next, please! >

09:01.561 --> 09:03.441
Hang on. We're moving.

09:11.201 --> 09:12.679
What you doin'?

09:12.681 --> 09:14.679
Do us a favour. Cause a distraction.

09:14.681 --> 09:16.159
What?

09:16.161 --> 09:18.879
Swoon. Have a funny turn.
Fit of the vapours.

09:18.881 --> 09:20.359
Are you crackers?

09:20.361 --> 09:23.479
Go on.
There's a guinea in it for you.

09:23.481 --> 09:26.001
Done.

10:19.121 --> 10:23.759
Them new manufacturers can do
'orrible things to a person.

10:23.761 --> 10:25.559
'Orrible.

10:25.561 --> 10:30.159
I've pickled things in here
that'd fair turn your hair

10:30.161 --> 10:32.681
snowy as top of Buckden Pike.

10:33.881 --> 10:36.239
You know what I'm looking for.

10:36.241 --> 10:39.919
Oh, aye.
All them bits found in't canal.

10:39.921 --> 10:42.001
The Crimson Horror!

10:54.441 --> 10:56.719
It hardly seems possible.

10:56.721 --> 10:58.039
Eh?

10:58.041 --> 10:59.441
I think...

11:00.641 --> 11:03.679
I think I've seen
these symptoms before.

11:03.681 --> 11:05.239
Oh, aye?

11:05.241 --> 11:06.599
A long time ago.

11:06.601 --> 11:08.359
Oh, aye? How long?

11:08.361 --> 11:11.441
About 65 million years!

11:16.401 --> 11:19.159
I trust you had
a pleasant day, Mama?

11:19.161 --> 11:20.761
Tolerable.

11:23.241 --> 11:26.759
Will Mr Sweet ever join us
for dinner, Mama?

11:26.761 --> 11:30.361
Mr Sweet is rather tired tonight,
I fear.

11:35.041 --> 11:39.599
Dear me. How clumsy I'm getting.

11:39.601 --> 11:41.721
To keep the Devil at bay.

13:10.081 --> 13:13.721
All right, mate.
You just stay calm now!

13:18.921 --> 13:23.201
I could open this door.
Would you like that?

13:25.241 --> 13:26.641
Thought you might.

13:28.121 --> 13:33.241
But you and me has got to come to
an arrangement, savvy?

13:36.961 --> 13:39.719
Now, you stand well back.
Do you hear me?

13:39.721 --> 13:41.319
I don't mean no harm to ya'.

13:41.321 --> 13:45.479
But you try anything funny
and I'll leave you here to rot.

13:45.481 --> 13:47.401
Is that understood?

13:49.481 --> 13:50.921
Right.

14:01.321 --> 14:03.001
Doctor?

14:06.521 --> 14:08.521
What's happened to you?

14:14.041 --> 14:16.281
Can't you speak?

14:23.521 --> 14:25.801
Right. We're getting out of here.

14:37.561 --> 14:40.041
Come on!

14:42.001 --> 14:43.801
Come on!

15:22.081 --> 15:24.161
Oh, my God.

15:39.401 --> 15:43.999
You're all I have, monster.
But all will be well.

15:44.001 --> 15:48.521
Imperfect as we are, there be will
room for us in the new Jerusalem!

16:00.601 --> 16:05.721
No... NO! Where are you, monster?
Where are you?

16:11.881 --> 16:14.601
What is it? You want to go there?

16:47.761 --> 16:49.439
Ah! Missed me? Doctor!

16:49.441 --> 16:51.999
Jenny! Jenny, Jenny, Jenny!

16:52.001 --> 16:54.199
Just when you think your favourite

16:54.201 --> 16:57.879
lock-picking Victorian chambermaid
will never turn up!

16:57.881 --> 16:59.361
Jenny!

17:03.121 --> 17:06.919
You've no idea how good that feels!
Right! Mrs Gillyflower!

17:06.921 --> 17:09.398
We've got to stop her!
And then there's Clara. Poor Clara.

17:09.401 --> 17:11.279
Where's Clara? Clara?

17:11.281 --> 17:13.638
Doctor, wait!
Can't. Clara. Got to find.

17:13.641 --> 17:17.079
What happened to you? How long
have you been like that?

17:17.080 --> 17:20.441
Days. Weeks. Don't know. Long story.
I'll keep it short.

17:24.721 --> 17:29.559
OK. Not London 1893.

17:29.561 --> 17:32.519
Yorkshire 1893. Near enough.

17:32.521 --> 17:35.519
You're making a habit of this.
Getting us lost.

17:35.521 --> 17:37.999
Sorry.
It's much better than it used to be.

17:38.001 --> 17:40.399
I once spent a hell of a long time
trying to get

17:40.401 --> 17:42.639
a gobby Australian
to Heathrow Airport.

17:42.641 --> 17:45.641
What for? Search me. Anyway...

17:48.201 --> 17:49.841
Brave heart, Clara!

17:54.841 --> 17:57.759
It's another one, don't you see?
Another victim!

17:57.761 --> 17:59.199
Why won't any one of you listen?

17:59.201 --> 18:00.801
We'll listen.

18:01.801 --> 18:04.519
Mrs Winifred Gillyflower.
An astonishing woman.

18:04.521 --> 18:07.399
A prize-winning chemist and
mechanical engineer. So why...

18:07.401 --> 18:10.999
Why has she decided to open up a
match factory in her old home town?

18:11.001 --> 18:14.761
And no-one who ever goes to live
there ever seems to come out.

18:19.521 --> 18:21.159
Same as the rest.

18:21.161 --> 18:24.759
All dead from causes unknown
and their flesh... glowing.

18:24.761 --> 18:27.279
Like something manky
in a coal cellar.

18:27.281 --> 18:31.039
They keep turning up in't canal.
The Crimson Horror!

18:31.041 --> 18:36.481
Ooh. Good name. Hey, that's good,
isn't it? The Crimson Horror!

18:38.081 --> 18:39.841
I wonder what it is.

18:41.241 --> 18:44.559
Do you know the old Romany
superstition, Clara?

18:44.561 --> 18:47.359
That the eye of a dead person
retains an image of

18:47.361 --> 18:48.759
the last thing it sees?

18:48.761 --> 18:50.079
Nonsense, of course.

18:50.081 --> 18:52.479
Unless the chemical composition
of the body

18:52.481 --> 18:54.081
has been massively corrupted.

19:00.761 --> 19:05.759
Wow. This is nasty.
An organic poison. A sort of venom.

19:05.761 --> 19:08.039
And you think it's connected
to Sweetville?

19:08.041 --> 19:09.439
I do.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.801
Well, then, we need a plan!

19:13.681 --> 19:18.759
Doctor and Mrs Smith. Oh, yes.
You'll do very nicely.

19:18.761 --> 19:21.159
Oh, grand. Smashing.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.321
Eh, the missus and I couldn't be
more chuffed, could we, love?

19:27.801 --> 19:31.199
Sweetville will provide you with
everything you need.

19:31.201 --> 19:34.079
You won't have to worry about
a thing... ever again.

19:34.081 --> 19:35.959
The name. Sweetville. Yes?

19:35.961 --> 19:39.199
Why not name it after yourself?
After all, it's your creation.

19:39.201 --> 19:40.999
Gillyflowertown?

19:41.001 --> 19:43.679
Gillyflowerland!
You could have roller-coasters.

19:43.681 --> 19:46.119
It is named in tribute to
my partner.

19:46.121 --> 19:47.599
Your late partner?

19:47.601 --> 19:52.599
No. My... silent partner. Mr Sweet
likes to keep himself to himself.

19:52.601 --> 19:54.479
Shall we move on?

19:54.481 --> 19:56.279
Who lives here?

19:56.281 --> 19:58.119
Oh, names don't matter here.

19:58.121 --> 20:02.281
All you need to know is that we only
recruit the brightest and the best.

20:23.001 --> 20:25.959
Like pretty maids all in a row.

20:25.961 --> 20:28.719
The process improves
with every attempt!

20:28.721 --> 20:31.759
Mr Sweet is such a clever old thing.

20:31.761 --> 20:36.359
Oh, into the canal with
the rejects, Ada.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.161
Yes.

20:45.561 --> 20:47.201
Ma...

20:54.081 --> 20:59.559
Sometimes, the preservation process
goes wrong. Only Mr Sweet knows why.

20:59.561 --> 21:02.639
And only Mama is allowed
to talk to Mr Sweet.

21:02.641 --> 21:06.439
But if you're very good,
you can stay here.

21:06.441 --> 21:08.401
You'll be my secret.

21:09.801 --> 21:12.121
My special monster.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.279
Poor Edmund must have come
looking for us.

21:46.281 --> 21:49.359
And then fallen into a vat of
the pure venom.

21:49.361 --> 21:53.119
Or was pushed.
Didn't stand a chance.

21:53.121 --> 21:54.959
What is that stuff, though?

21:54.961 --> 21:56.479
Deadly poison.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.279
And Mrs Gillyflower's dipping her
Pilgrims in a dilute form

21:59.281 --> 22:01.159
to protect them. Preserve them.

22:01.161 --> 22:04.359
Process didn't work on me.
Maybe because I'm not human.

22:04.361 --> 22:06.679
I ended up on the reject pile.

22:06.681 --> 22:08.719
Preserve them against what?

22:08.721 --> 22:11.281
Well, according to her,
the coming apocalypse!

22:12.721 --> 22:17.719
"When the End of Days is come and
judgement rains down upon us all..."

22:17.721 --> 22:20.279
What? Nothing. No, what?

22:20.281 --> 22:24.119
Something Mrs Gillyflower said.
One of her sermons.

22:24.121 --> 22:27.399
Madame will come looking for me.
We'd best get on.

22:27.401 --> 22:29.761
Yes! Clara, got to find Clara.
But, Doctor...

22:30.961 --> 22:32.521
Clara's dead.

22:33.721 --> 22:35.241
Isn't she?

22:36.561 --> 22:38.401
It's complicated.

22:44.481 --> 22:47.999
Horse!
You have failed in your mission.

22:48.001 --> 22:50.799
We are lost,
with no sign of Sweetville.

22:50.801 --> 22:54.161
Do you have any final words,
before your summary execution?

22:56.721 --> 23:02.959
The usual story. Fourth one
this week, and I'm not even hungry.

23:02.961 --> 23:04.679
Sweetville, sir?

23:04.681 --> 23:06.479
Do you know it?

23:06.481 --> 23:08.399
Turn around when possible.

23:08.401 --> 23:11.319
Then, at the end of the road,
turn right. What?

23:11.321 --> 23:13.279
Bear left for a quarter of a mile

23:13.281 --> 23:15.841
and you will have reached
your destination.

23:22.961 --> 23:25.479
Thank you. What is your name?

23:25.481 --> 23:27.559
Thomas, sir. Thomas Thomas.

23:27.561 --> 23:30.761
I think you will do well,
Thomas Thomas.

23:33.841 --> 23:38.039
Are we talking about the same
person? About that Clara?

23:38.041 --> 23:39.601
Doctor!

23:42.961 --> 23:44.639
Couldn't see much from where I was,

23:44.641 --> 23:47.279
but I think she survived
the process.

23:47.281 --> 23:48.879
She must be here somewhere.

23:48.881 --> 23:51.399
But Clara died. The Ice Lady...

23:51.401 --> 23:52.799
Doctor?

23:52.801 --> 23:55.559
Well... it's... er...

23:55.561 --> 23:57.201
It's complicated.

24:16.841 --> 24:20.199
What is the meaning of this?

24:20.201 --> 24:24.441
Oh, Mama, I have been foolish.

24:25.961 --> 24:30.081
I have formed
a... a sentimental attachment.

24:31.281 --> 24:33.799
An attachment? To whom?

24:33.801 --> 24:38.519
A young man. Unlike the others,
he survived rejection.

24:38.521 --> 24:41.839
He must be strong.
Worthy of salvation.

24:41.841 --> 24:46.279
Wrecker! Berserker! You have loosed
a reject onto the outside world!

24:46.281 --> 24:47.959
I have disappointed you.

24:47.961 --> 24:49.959
My plans must be accelerated.

24:49.961 --> 24:52.599
Nothing must interfere with
the Great Work!

24:52.601 --> 24:55.839
But please say there is still
room for me in your new Eden, Mama!

24:55.841 --> 24:57.279
Promise me that!

24:57.281 --> 25:00.239
I will set my Pilgrims onto him. No!

25:00.241 --> 25:04.559
Kindly do not paw
and slobber at my crinolines.

25:04.561 --> 25:07.559
You know I cannot bear
to look at sick people.

25:07.561 --> 25:10.839
Promise you will not abandon me,
Mama, promise me that!

25:10.841 --> 25:14.879
Do you not yet understand that
there can be no place

25:14.881 --> 25:16.839
for people such as you?

25:16.841 --> 25:21.481
That only perfection is good enough
for myself and for Mr Sweet.

25:24.041 --> 25:28.001
The bright day is done, child,
and you are for the dark.

25:37.121 --> 25:38.999
Can she be revived, like you were?

25:39.001 --> 25:40.681
I hope so.

25:46.961 --> 25:48.319
Doctor.

25:48.321 --> 25:51.279
Oh. Great. Great.
Attack of the supermodels.

25:51.281 --> 25:53.919
Time for a plan.

25:53.921 --> 25:56.361
Nah, Doctor. This one's on me.

26:10.521 --> 26:12.921
That is a plan!

26:14.321 --> 26:17.041
OK. Time for a new plan.

26:26.481 --> 26:27.919
Quickly! Let's go! No!

26:27.921 --> 26:29.559
No, ma'am! We're not escaping!

26:29.561 --> 26:31.841
We've got to help the Doctor
with Clara!

26:35.321 --> 26:36.999
Long story.

26:37.001 --> 26:39.719
What now, Madame?
We could lay mimetic cluster mines.

26:39.721 --> 26:42.239
Strax. Or dig trenches
and fill them with acid.

26:42.241 --> 26:44.039
Strax! You're overexcited.

26:44.041 --> 26:47.281
Have you been eating Miss Jenny's
sherbet fancies again?

26:48.561 --> 26:51.079
No. Go outside and wait for me
until I call for you.

26:51.081 --> 26:52.961
But, Madame... Go!

26:55.801 --> 26:58.121
I'm going to go
and play with my grenades.

26:59.361 --> 27:02.321
OK, I think she's about done.

27:05.561 --> 27:09.359
I know who you think she is,
but she isn't.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.879
She can't be.

27:10.881 --> 27:14.521
I was right, then. You and Clara
have unfinished business.

27:17.921 --> 27:19.759
Hello, stranger.

27:19.761 --> 27:21.599
Doctor?

27:21.601 --> 27:23.559
Uh-huh.

27:23.561 --> 27:25.361
Hi.

27:27.161 --> 27:30.119
What's going on?

27:30.121 --> 27:32.439
Haven't you heard, love?

27:32.441 --> 27:33.881
There's trouble at t'mill!

27:35.281 --> 27:36.961
She's a lizard.

27:39.561 --> 27:42.159
My people once ruled this world,
as well you know.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.519
But we did not rule it alone.

27:43.521 --> 27:47.239
Just as humanity fights a daily
battle against nature, so did we.

27:47.241 --> 27:48.639
And our greatest plague,

27:48.641 --> 27:53.319
the most virulent enemy
was the repulsive red leech.

27:53.321 --> 27:55.679
Ooh! The repulsive red leech!

27:55.681 --> 27:58.039
Nah. On balance, I think I prefer
the Crimson Horror.

27:58.041 --> 27:59.359
What was it exactly?

27:59.361 --> 28:01.879
A tiny parasite.
It infected our drinking water.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.839
And once in our systems,
it secreted a fatal poison.

28:04.841 --> 28:06.239
If it's been hanging around,

28:06.241 --> 28:10.359
lurking in the shadows,
maybe it's evolved.

28:10.361 --> 28:12.839
Or maybe it's had help.

28:12.841 --> 28:15.199
Doctor, I've been thinking,
the chimney...

28:15.201 --> 28:16.759
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way past that now!

28:16.761 --> 28:18.959
Yucky red parasite
from the time of the dinosaurs

28:18.961 --> 28:21.679
pitches up in Victorian Yorkshire.
Didn't see that one coming!

28:21.681 --> 28:22.919
Yeah, but the chimney...

28:22.921 --> 28:24.959
But what's the connection to
Mrs Gillyflower?

28:24.961 --> 28:27.241
"Judgement will
rain down on us all..."

28:30.721 --> 28:32.441
An empty mill.

28:34.681 --> 28:36.841
A chimney that doesn't blow smoke.

28:41.081 --> 28:44.121
Clever clogs. Missed me?
Yeah, lots!

28:50.201 --> 28:52.479
She's going to poison the air!

28:52.481 --> 28:53.961
How?

29:04.241 --> 29:07.001
With that, I should think.

29:10.121 --> 29:12.839
And there's the poison.

29:12.841 --> 29:15.561
All right, gang, I've got a plan.

29:19.441 --> 29:20.761
Shh!

29:22.481 --> 29:23.841
OK.

29:55.241 --> 29:58.081
Who's that? Who is there?

30:07.641 --> 30:11.399
You. It's you! My monster.

30:11.401 --> 30:16.679
You've come back! But you're...
Warm. And alive. Thanks to you, Ada.

30:16.681 --> 30:20.919
You saved me from your mother's
human rubbish tip.

30:20.921 --> 30:22.999
Now, what's wrong?

30:23.001 --> 30:27.841
She does not want me, monster!
I am not to be chosen.

30:28.921 --> 30:32.559
Perhaps it was my own sin,
the blackness in my heart,

30:32.561 --> 30:34.479
that my father saw in me.

30:34.481 --> 30:37.119
Ada, no. That's nonsense.

30:37.121 --> 30:40.121
Stupid, backwards nonsense,
and you know it!

30:41.641 --> 30:43.121
You know it.

30:46.601 --> 30:48.199
What is it?

30:48.201 --> 30:49.959
Who is that?

30:49.961 --> 30:56.079
I'm... I'm a friend, a friend of his.

30:56.081 --> 31:00.401
Then you are fortunate, indeed.
It isn't good to be alone.

31:02.641 --> 31:09.161
Now, Ada, I need you tell me
something - who is Mr Sweet?

31:11.081 --> 31:12.519
Ada?

31:12.521 --> 31:14.759
Oh, dear monster... Please. Tell me.

31:14.761 --> 31:18.121
I cannot! Even now, I cannot!
I cannot betray Mama.

31:23.241 --> 31:28.801
Well, come with us, then.
There's something you need to know.

31:47.961 --> 31:51.599
You do seem to keep turning up
like a bad penny, young man.

31:51.601 --> 31:52.759
Force of habit.

31:52.761 --> 31:55.679
Can I offer you something?
Tea? Seed cake?

31:55.681 --> 31:57.719
A glass of Amontillado?

31:57.721 --> 32:00.799
No, thanks. We've had a skinful
already, as you might say.

32:00.801 --> 32:02.679
Ha! Very funny.

32:02.681 --> 32:06.159
I'm the Doctor, you're nuts,
and I'm going to stop you.

32:06.161 --> 32:09.639
I'm afraid Mr Sweet and I
cannot allow that.

32:09.641 --> 32:13.039
Oh, yes. Would it be impolite to ask
why you and Mr Sweet are petrifying

32:13.041 --> 32:16.079
your workforce with diluted
prehistoric leech venom?

32:16.081 --> 32:17.919
So when do we get to meet him,

32:17.921 --> 32:20.959
this silent partner of yours?
Why's he so shy?

32:20.961 --> 32:23.039
Mr Sweet is always with us.

32:23.041 --> 32:26.079
You seem to have a very close
relationship, you and your pal.

32:26.081 --> 32:28.801
Oh, yes, Doctor. Exceedingly close.

32:31.041 --> 32:33.721
Symbiotic, you might say.

32:49.521 --> 32:52.199
Doctor... What is it?

32:52.201 --> 32:53.599
A survivor!

32:53.601 --> 32:58.319
He has grown fat on the filth
humanity has pumped into the rivers.

32:58.321 --> 32:59.879
That's where I found him.

32:59.881 --> 33:01.319
Very enterprising.

33:01.321 --> 33:04.999
His needs are simple. And in return,
he gives me his nectar.

33:05.001 --> 33:09.559
Mrs Gillyflower, you have no idea
what you're dealing with!

33:09.561 --> 33:14.319
In the wrong hands, that venom could
wipe out all life on this planet!

33:14.321 --> 33:16.121
Do you know what these are?

33:17.801 --> 33:20.161
The wrong hands!

33:36.561 --> 33:38.759
Planning a little fireworks party,
are we?

33:38.761 --> 33:42.279
You've forced me to advance
the Great Work somewhat, Doctor.

33:42.281 --> 33:45.719
But my colossal scheme
remains as it was.

33:45.721 --> 33:49.279
My rocket will explode
high in the atmosphere,

33:49.281 --> 33:53.839
raining down Mr Sweet's beneficence
onto all humanity.

33:53.841 --> 33:55.439
And wiping us all out! You can't!

33:55.441 --> 33:58.719
My new Adam and Eves
will sleep for but a few months

33:58.721 --> 34:02.439
before stepping out into
a golden dawn.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.441
Is it not beautiful, Doctor?

34:08.201 --> 34:11.079
Tell us about Ada, Mrs Gillyflower.

34:11.081 --> 34:12.399
What?

34:12.400 --> 34:14.679
Your daughter.
You do remember your daughter?

34:14.681 --> 34:16.399
Tell us about your daughter.

34:16.400 --> 34:20.079
How can you speak of such trivia
when my hour is at hand?

34:20.081 --> 34:23.998
The child is of no consequence.
Is that why you experimented on her?

34:24.001 --> 34:25.239
Experimented?

34:25.241 --> 34:27.679
The signs are all there.
The pattern of scarring.

34:27.681 --> 34:30.839
You used her as a guinea pig,
didn't you?

34:30.841 --> 34:31.998
God!

34:32.001 --> 34:34.161
Sometimes, sacrifices must be made.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.759
Sacrifices?

34:37.761 --> 34:39.478
It was necessary!

34:39.481 --> 34:43.319
I had to find out how much of the
venom would produce an anti-toxin.

34:43.321 --> 34:46.998
To immunise myself! Don't you see?
It was necessary!

34:47.001 --> 34:48.559
Mama?

34:48.561 --> 34:51.559
Is it... Is it true?

34:51.561 --> 34:52.958
Ada.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.518
It is. It's true. True.

34:56.521 --> 34:58.919
Ada, listen to me.

34:58.921 --> 35:06.359
You hag! You perfidious hag!
You virago! You harpy!

35:06.361 --> 35:10.039
All these years, I have helped you,
served you.

35:10.041 --> 35:14.719
Looked out for you. Does it
count for nothing? Nothing at all?

35:14.721 --> 35:16.921
Stop, stop.

35:18.081 --> 35:20.439
Hang on,
I've got the sonic screwdriver!

35:20.441 --> 35:22.759
Yeah? I've got a chair!

35:22.761 --> 35:24.761
No!

35:28.281 --> 35:35.681
Yeah. That worked. I'm afraid your
rocket isn't going anywhere, Mrs G.

35:50.401 --> 35:53.801
Please, come to me, Ada.

35:58.081 --> 36:00.319
My child.

36:00.321 --> 36:05.119
You have always been so very...

36:05.121 --> 36:07.119
useful.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.279
No, Mrs Gillyflower.

36:09.281 --> 36:11.959
Please, Mama. No more. No more.

36:11.961 --> 36:16.679
And now, if you'll please forgive us,
we must be going.

36:16.681 --> 36:20.919
It is long past Ada's bedtime!

36:20.921 --> 36:22.359
No... No, Clara.

36:22.361 --> 36:25.199
If we follow straight after her,
she'll shoot Ada on the spot.

36:25.201 --> 36:27.001
She wouldn't! She would!

36:30.361 --> 36:32.481
Chairs are useful!

36:37.041 --> 36:39.479
Come, Ada. Don't dawdle.
Please, Mama, stop.

36:39.481 --> 36:41.719
Has the venom been loaded?

36:41.721 --> 36:44.241
Yes, ma'am. Then heaven awaits ya'!

37:04.681 --> 37:06.201
Stop!

37:11.561 --> 37:15.199
Just let her go, Mrs Gillyflower.
Let Ada go!

37:15.201 --> 37:17.399
Secondary firing mechanism, Doctor!

37:17.401 --> 37:20.079
Mr Sweet and I are too smart for you,
after all.

37:20.081 --> 37:23.681
Just let your daughter go,
Mrs Gillyflower.

37:27.361 --> 37:30.839
Shoot, if you wish, Mama.
It is of no matter,

37:30.841 --> 37:32.961
for you killed me a long time ago.

37:39.041 --> 37:41.679
♪ I'll labour night and day

37:41.681 --> 37:44.361
♪ To be a pilgrim! ♪

38:02.561 --> 38:08.721
Now, Mr Sweet, now the whole world
will taste your lethal kiss!

38:09.801 --> 38:12.481
I don't think so, Mrs Gillyflower.

38:18.201 --> 38:20.479
Very well, then.

38:20.481 --> 38:25.719
If I can't take the world with me,
you will have to do.

38:25.721 --> 38:29.039
Die, you freaks! Die!

38:29.041 --> 38:30.919
Die!

38:30.921 --> 38:33.761
Put down your weapon, human female!

38:44.921 --> 38:46.641
Ouch!

38:57.681 --> 39:00.999
No... No!

39:01.001 --> 39:04.919
Mr Sweet? Where are you going?

39:04.921 --> 39:09.959
You can't leave me now, Mr Sweet.

39:09.961 --> 39:11.439
What's it doing?

39:11.441 --> 39:14.279
It knows she's dying.
She's no longer any use to it.

39:14.281 --> 39:15.561
Mr Sweet!

39:17.841 --> 39:19.721
Ada?

39:21.481 --> 39:22.961
Ada.

39:25.761 --> 39:27.561
Are you there?

39:29.401 --> 39:31.719
I'm here, Mama.

39:31.721 --> 39:36.561
Forgive me, my child. Forgive me.

39:40.281 --> 39:42.159
Never.

39:42.161 --> 39:45.001
That's... my... girl.

39:58.641 --> 40:00.879
What will you do with that thing?

40:00.881 --> 40:05.601
Take it back to the Jurassic era,
maybe. Out of harm's way.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.761
On the other hand...

40:20.721 --> 40:24.679
Right, London. We were
heading for London, weren't we?

40:24.681 --> 40:26.359
Was there any particular reason?

40:26.361 --> 40:30.719
No. Thought you might... like it.

40:30.721 --> 40:33.919
Yeah. Maybe had enough
Victorian values for a bit.

40:33.921 --> 40:35.399
You're the boss.

40:35.401 --> 40:36.839
Am I?

40:36.841 --> 40:39.841
No. No... Get in.

40:44.921 --> 40:48.079
Now, Ada, I'd love to stay
and clear up the mess, but...

40:48.081 --> 40:50.119
I know, dear monster,
you have things to do.

40:50.121 --> 40:51.719
And what about you?

40:51.721 --> 40:54.519
Oh, there are many things
a bright young lady can do

40:54.521 --> 40:56.159
to occupy her time.

40:56.161 --> 40:59.759
It's time I stepped out of
the darkness and into the light.

40:59.761 --> 41:04.441
Good luck, Ada.
You know, I think you'll be just...

41:08.721 --> 41:10.281
splendid.

41:14.721 --> 41:18.879
Well, thanks a million, you three,
as ever.

41:18.881 --> 41:22.361
Have some Pontefract cakes on me.
I love Pontefract cakes!

41:23.961 --> 41:27.319
See you around, eh?
I shouldn't wonder.

41:27.321 --> 41:33.081
But, Doctor, that girl - Clara.
You haven't explained.

41:42.001 --> 41:44.681
No. I haven't.

41:49.081 --> 41:52.641
Ah, look at the muck in here! Right!

41:54.321 --> 41:57.199
Another one for the vault.

41:57.201 --> 41:59.439
Ah! There you are.

41:59.441 --> 42:01.921
I called to see whether there had
been any progress.

42:15.641 --> 42:18.641
The boss, yep, that's me!

42:26.361 --> 42:28.041
I am the boss.

42:41.761 --> 42:46.959
It's you, isn't it? It's from
the '70s, but it's definitely you.

42:46.961 --> 42:48.639
Of course it's not.

42:48.641 --> 42:54.241
And that's you too, from 1983,
I found it at school.

42:55.601 --> 42:57.999
No, it's just someone
who looks like me.

42:58.001 --> 43:00.599
And that's someone
that looks like your boyfriend?

43:00.601 --> 43:02.239
Is he an alien?

43:02.241 --> 43:04.239
Why would he be an alien?

43:04.241 --> 43:05.479
The chin.

43:05.481 --> 43:07.321
And the time travel?

43:10.761 --> 43:12.159
That's not right.

43:12.161 --> 43:15.801
You were in Victorian London.
No, I was in Victorian Yorkshire.

43:17.921 --> 43:21.199
How come you didn't tell us?
Time travel, that's so cool!

43:21.201 --> 43:23.759
Can we have a go?
Can you have a what?!

43:23.761 --> 43:26.479
We want a shot at the time machine!
No, no, no! Listen...

43:26.481 --> 43:32.161
OK, or we'll have to tell Dad that
our nanny's a time traveller!

43:40.161 --> 43:41.439
Hedgewick's World,

43:41.441 --> 43:44.839
the biggest and best amusement park
there will ever be!

43:44.841 --> 43:48.319
Yeah, it's closed down,
reports of people just vanishing.

43:48.321 --> 43:50.119
No need to panic, my young friends.

43:50.121 --> 43:52.479
We all know there are no more
living Cybermen.

43:52.481 --> 43:54.719
Attack formation, quickly!

43:54.721 --> 43:56.401
Don't wander off!

43:59.601 --> 44:02.639
Take defensive positions!

44:02.641 --> 44:05.879
They're here!

44:05.881 --> 44:08.906
Hail to you, the Doctor!
Saviour of the Cybermen!
