Julian likes green.

She just changed
her mind, Brooke.

00:30.709 --> 00:32.343
She held her in her arms,

00:32.411 --> 00:33.745
and she just couldn't
go through with it.

00:33.813 --> 00:35.430
Quinn?
It's time.

Take your seats.

03:15.958 --> 03:18.092
Stop talking,
and let's begin.

03:21.430 --> 03:25.216
Well, it seems my class
gets younger every day.

03:25.267 --> 03:27.185
You must have done
exceedingly well

03:27.252 --> 03:28.919
on your advanced placement
exams.

03:28.971 --> 03:30.688
What's your name, son?

03:30.756 --> 03:32.256
Jamie Scott.

03:32.307 --> 03:34.726
Jamie Scott.
Of course.

03:34.777 --> 03:36.561
And your father is...

03:36.628 --> 03:40.815
Nathan Scott.
He's sitting right there.

03:40.899 --> 03:42.567
Mr. Scott.

03:42.618 --> 03:44.569
Is it because
you couldn't afford a sitter,

03:44.620 --> 03:46.954
or did you bring your son
to match wits with me,

03:47.039 --> 03:48.873
like your so-called
business partner,

03:48.940 --> 03:51.709
who, frankly, looked to be
about the same age?

03:51.777 --> 03:53.745
Nothing like that.

03:53.796 --> 03:55.463
He just wanted to
see you again.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.801
But I don't believe we've met.

03:59.885 --> 04:02.136
You have, briefly.

04:02.221 --> 04:04.272
We ran into each other
the night of the big storm.

04:06.008 --> 04:08.009
Well, actually,
you ran into Jamie.

04:08.093 --> 04:09.644
You were in your Wagoneer.

04:09.712 --> 04:11.929
You're sure it was
the night of the storm?

04:11.980 --> 04:13.765
Absolutely.
You were in your Wagoneer,

04:13.816 --> 04:16.951
and you were with your friend,
Mr. Phidian.

04:17.019 --> 04:18.435
And you were in a hurry,

04:18.487 --> 04:20.822
so we really didn't get a chance
to talk.

04:20.906 --> 04:22.523
Well, we should do that --

04:22.608 --> 04:24.642
perhaps after class
in my office.

04:24.693 --> 04:26.477
We know where to find you.

04:28.497 --> 04:31.282
Come on, Jamie.
We're holding up class.

04:45.931 --> 04:48.633
You know...

04:48.684 --> 04:50.551
You won't get another today.

Hey.

06:26.353 --> 06:29.105
Drugs -- more specifically,
drug stores.

06:29.190 --> 06:32.325
I do a story on drug stores?
What's the angle?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.727
The angle is how drug stores
are the new coffeehouses.

06:34.779 --> 06:36.446
Remember when there was
a new coffee shop

06:36.530 --> 06:37.897
on every block?

06:37.948 --> 06:39.332
Well, now it's drug stores.
They're <i>everywhere.</i>

06:39.399 --> 06:41.751
It's like caffeine used to be
the drug of choice,

06:41.836 --> 06:43.736
but now people
are skipping the coffee

06:43.788 --> 06:45.288
and going right for
the actual drugs.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.923
They could wash it down
with the coffee.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.007
What else you got?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.209
How 'bout the airlines?

06:49.260 --> 06:50.960
We keep bailing them out
with more money,

06:51.045 --> 06:52.462
and they keep sucking.

06:52.546 --> 06:55.231
You could do an exposé on
the worst airline on the planet.

06:55.299 --> 06:57.217
They have those planes that
don't ever leave the airport.

06:57.268 --> 06:59.235
I should probably keep it
more general than that.

06:59.303 --> 07:00.603
Okay, so talk about

07:00.688 --> 07:02.021
how the airlines charge
for everything now --

07:02.089 --> 07:03.422
snacks, bags,

07:03.474 --> 07:05.442
that ratty scrap of disease
they call a blanket.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.193
Not bad.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.728
<i>And</i> they lie.
They're such liars.

07:08.779 --> 07:11.147
They know when your flight's
gonna be three hours late,

07:11.232 --> 07:13.950
but instead of telling you,
they say your flight's on time.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.152
Then they change the status
every 20 minutes

07:16.237 --> 07:18.238
to give you 9 times' worth
of false hope,

07:18.289 --> 07:20.439
as if that somehow makes it
not as bad.

07:20.491 --> 07:22.408
Oh, how 'bout when they tell you
to turn off your phone

07:22.460 --> 07:23.910
for safety reasons?

07:23.961 --> 07:26.246
If the safety of the plane
could be affected by cellphones,

07:26.297 --> 07:28.414
do you really think they'd
let you bring them on board?

07:28.466 --> 07:29.749
I never thought of that.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.217
In this day and age,

07:31.285 --> 07:32.752
considering all
their restrictions,

07:32.803 --> 07:34.754
we're really gonna trust
first-time-flyer Carl

07:34.805 --> 07:36.923
back in 14C
to turn off his cellphone

07:36.974 --> 07:38.424
so we can all
land safely?

07:38.476 --> 07:40.376
I mean, considering he boarded
with the wrong group,

07:40.444 --> 07:41.627
reeks of cologne,

07:41.679 --> 07:43.730
and laughs out loud
at his own jokes,

07:43.797 --> 07:46.299
that's the guy we're gonna trust
to do the right thing?

07:46.350 --> 07:48.499
You're kind of angry,
Marvin McFadden.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.186
About flying?
Yeah, a little.

07:50.271 --> 07:53.323
Some idiot tries to light a bomb
with his stinking sweaty feet,

07:53.407 --> 07:54.858
and now I got to
take my shoes off

07:54.942 --> 07:56.860
to walk through the foot rot
of a million travelers

07:56.927 --> 07:58.027
every time I fly.

07:58.112 --> 07:59.863
They should have sentenced
that guy

07:59.947 --> 08:02.782
to stand near the security check
at every major airport,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.834
and we should get
unlimited kicks.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.156
My baby is cranky.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.842
Who's a fussy baby?

08:12.927 --> 08:14.677
Who's a fussy baby?

08:14.762 --> 08:16.296
No, there's no reason
to fuss.

08:16.347 --> 08:18.348
No, there's no reason to fuss,
baby.

08:18.432 --> 08:19.883
Oh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.635

with you.

08:22.686 --> 08:24.670
Oh, boy, a baby,
<i>and</i> a bunny.

08:24.722 --> 08:27.724
Well, the cute factor's high.
Why is Chester upset?

08:27.791 --> 08:29.142
Well, I kind of told him

08:29.193 --> 08:32.227
that Lydia's middle name was Bob
after of grandma's cat,

08:32.313 --> 08:34.280
and he was a little hurt
by it.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.649
Oh.
Gee, I'm sorry.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.635
Well, he does have
a good point.

08:38.702 --> 08:40.837
Lydia Chester Scott --
I don't know.

08:40.905 --> 08:42.488
It doesn't quite have
the right ring to it, does it?

08:42.539 --> 08:44.240
Does it?
I guess.

08:44.325 --> 08:45.375
But if I ever have
a kid...

08:46.744 --> 08:48.578
...Their middle name's
gonna be Chester.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.079
I suppose that's fair.

08:50.147 --> 08:51.998
So, what do you got going on
today, kiddo?

08:52.066 --> 08:53.216
Not much.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.751
Dad's gonna take me
to the Rivercourt

08:54.835 --> 08:56.085
every day this week
as a reward.

08:56.153 --> 08:57.620
A reward for what?

08:57.688 --> 09:00.223
For going to his class
and messing with his teacher.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.925
August Kellerman?

09:02.009 --> 09:05.211
Yeah, I think that's him.
He has the bulldog, right?

09:05.262 --> 09:06.980
Yeah, Dogust.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.698
I wonder if his son's
middle name is Dogust.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.103
She's pretty awesome, mom.

09:17.358 --> 09:19.242

the same thing.

Well, Haley asked me to help out
for a couple of weeks

09:45.919 --> 09:47.103

10:08.942 --> 10:10.943

10:17.617 --> 10:19.002
Damn it.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.786
No. No "damn it."

10:20.838 --> 10:23.890
Besides...
I know something you don't.

10:26.310 --> 10:29.012
Whatever you think you know,
you've made a mistake.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.014
I saw the car in your garage.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.332
First of all,

10:32.399 --> 10:35.184
my home and my vehicle
are my own business.

10:35.269 --> 10:37.787
Beyond that, I had an accident.
So what?

10:37.855 --> 10:39.105
So what?

10:39.156 --> 10:41.357
So you nearly killed my son
and a good friend.

10:41.442 --> 10:42.692
You're wrong.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.078
I swerved to miss some deer,
and I hit a light pole.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.280
You hit a car, Kellerman,
on the Gabel Bridge,

10:47.331 --> 10:48.481
and then you drove away

10:48.532 --> 10:50.483
and left two people drowning
in the river

10:50.551 --> 10:51.617
when the levee broke.

10:51.669 --> 10:53.202
I didn't --
You didn't what?

10:53.270 --> 10:55.705
You didn't do it,
or you don't remember doing it,

10:55.789 --> 10:57.924
considering the empty bottle
of bourbon I found

10:57.991 --> 10:59.192
underneath
your front seat?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.160
You're making a mistake.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.713
Okay.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.465
Okay.

11:05.516 --> 11:08.000
So, you had an accident
the night of the big storm,

11:08.052 --> 11:09.185
you smashed the front

11:09.253 --> 11:10.553
of your late-model
maroon Grand Wagoneer,

11:10.637 --> 11:13.556
and then you drove away
without anybody seeing.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.943
Meanwhile, a <i>different</i>
<i>late-model maroon Grand Wagoneer</i>

11:17.010 --> 11:19.445
crashed into my son's car
on the same night

11:19.513 --> 11:22.365
at around the same time,
and then also drove away.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.450
And the eyewitness
is mistaken.

11:24.518 --> 11:27.236
I have nothing else
to say to you.

11:27.321 --> 11:28.905
Well, I have something
to say to you.

11:30.741 --> 11:34.310
My son was trapped
inside that car.

11:34.378 --> 11:37.964
He was scared,
and he was alone,

11:38.031 --> 11:40.383
and you left him there.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.503
His godmother nearly died
that night in front of his eyes.

11:43.554 --> 11:46.005
And you could have helped them,
but instead,

11:46.056 --> 11:48.224
you slipped into the shadows
like a coward.

11:49.843 --> 11:53.045
Well, I'm about to shine a light
into those shadows

11:53.097 --> 11:56.315
because <i>I</i> know what you did,
and <i>you</i> know what you did.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.853
And this is going to be
made right by you or by me.

12:00.904 --> 12:02.605
You think about that.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.191
Brooke, it's okay.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.476
I know.

12:42.646 --> 12:44.280
I don't want you
to worry about this stuff.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.481
I'm gonna paint the wall,

12:45.566 --> 12:47.099
and we're gonna send
these things back,

12:47.151 --> 12:48.434
and we're gonna be
just fine.

12:48.485 --> 12:50.653
I know.
I'm all right.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.321
I can do it.

12:52.406 --> 12:53.873

17:08.739 --> 17:10.156

there's a sign up here

17:15.246 --> 17:16.329
Yeah.

17:18.915 --> 17:21.218
Hey, uh...

17:21.301 --> 17:23.336
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

17:23.387 --> 17:24.671
Okay. See you.

17:24.722 --> 17:27.473
Just the man
I wanted to see.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.509
I believe
I owe you an apology.

17:29.577 --> 17:30.677
It's okay.

17:30.728 --> 17:32.262
That's gracious of you,
Jamie,

17:32.346 --> 17:33.730
but it's
certainly not okay.

17:33.814 --> 17:36.783
Do you mind if I speak
to your father for a minute?

17:36.851 --> 17:39.152
Well,
we can't play anyway.

17:39.220 --> 17:41.771
Jamie, why don't you go ahead and
wait in the car  for a minute, okay?

17:41.856 --> 17:43.190
Okay.

17:43.257 --> 17:44.741
Thanks, buddy.

17:46.244 --> 17:48.195
Hey, Professor Kellerman,

17:48.246 --> 17:50.197
can your dog actually ride
a skateboard?

17:50.248 --> 17:51.448
He can.

17:51.532 --> 17:53.366
Cool.

17:58.289 --> 18:01.541
I've been "Professor Kellerman"
for nearly 30 years.

18:01.592 --> 18:04.244
I'm a senior academic
with tenure.

18:04.295 --> 18:06.463
Do you know
what that means?

18:06.547 --> 18:08.265
It means
they can't fire you.

18:08.349 --> 18:11.268
It means they can't fire you
without cause,

18:11.352 --> 18:14.137
usually stemming
from severe misconduct.

18:14.255 --> 18:15.372
You mind if we sit?

18:15.439 --> 18:16.723
I'd rather stand.

18:16.774 --> 18:18.642
I'll sit.

18:18.726 --> 18:21.594
Academic tenure
is primarily intended

18:21.646 --> 18:23.730
to guarantee the right
of academic freedom.

18:23.781 --> 18:26.283
It protects teachers

18:26.367 --> 18:28.785
when they dissent
from prevailing opinion,

18:28.869 --> 18:30.770
openly disagree
with authorities,

18:30.821 --> 18:33.606
or spend time
on unfashionable topics.

18:33.658 --> 18:35.909
It does not, however,

18:35.960 --> 18:39.246
allow you to drive drunk and
flee the scene of an accident,

18:39.297 --> 18:41.164
which is what I did.

18:43.951 --> 18:46.136
I was having a dinner
in Raleigh,

18:46.220 --> 18:48.455
and I-I didn't want to
wait out the storm.

18:48.522 --> 18:50.140
So you drove home drunk,

18:50.224 --> 18:52.759
with an open bottle of Phidian's
in the car.

18:52.810 --> 18:54.811
And that was wrong.

18:54.879 --> 18:56.947
So, as of today,

18:57.014 --> 18:59.549
I'm no longer
Professor Kellerman.

18:59.617 --> 19:01.351
I've resigned my position.

19:01.435 --> 19:03.803
And I'll pay for any damages
to the vehicle,

19:03.854 --> 19:06.156
hospital bills --
all of it.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.942
I'd appreciate that
the authorities not be involved,

19:08.993 --> 19:11.361
but I'll understand
if you feel it's necessary.

19:11.445 --> 19:14.447
And one more thing.

19:14.498 --> 19:17.000
I'm sorry.

19:19.253 --> 19:21.671
It's a good system,
tenure...

19:21.756 --> 19:23.790
Except when teachers
fail to use their freedom

19:23.841 --> 19:24.991
for the common good.

19:31.549 --> 19:32.932
Condos.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.134
It's a shame.

19:34.185 --> 19:36.019
Parks are important
to a community,

19:36.103 --> 19:39.022
for families,
fathers and sons.

19:41.192 --> 19:44.227
It's a shame.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.826
and just close
the rest of it out.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.211
It's like you told me
that night on the mound --

21:38.263 --> 21:39.897
he cannot touch you
out there.

21:39.981 --> 21:41.565
You throw the ball, you
strike them out, and that's it.

21:41.649 --> 21:43.383
We'll do the rest.

21:43.434 --> 21:44.685
Okay.

21:44.736 --> 21:47.070
But before that,
we need to get some drinks --

21:47.138 --> 21:48.388
celebrate that baby.

21:48.439 --> 21:49.740
What are you guys
doing tonight?

21:49.824 --> 21:51.141
I'm going to Tric.

21:51.209 --> 21:52.492
Olin & The Moon,
Alex Dupré.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.911
If you guys
want to roll through,

21:53.995 --> 21:55.028
I can put you on the list.

21:56.247 --> 21:57.531
I'm gonna try to make it.

21:57.582 --> 21:59.499
It'll probably be
a late night, though.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.952
Perfect.
I'm gonna get a workout in,

22:02.036 --> 22:03.737
and, um, I want to
avoid Alex Dupré.

22:03.788 --> 22:06.340
I was kind of working that,
but she totally blew me off.

22:06.407 --> 22:07.841
Smart girl.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.260
All right, I got to go.

22:10.345 --> 22:12.346
Clay, I will see you tonight
if you can get in.

22:12.413 --> 22:15.098
Ian, why don't you ask Clay
why Alex Dupré knows

22:15.183 --> 22:16.683
he can see the ocean
from his bedroom?

22:18.186 --> 22:20.187
I've never asked him.

22:25.693 --> 22:28.111
So?

22:28.196 --> 22:31.148
Uh...
I'm thinking pancakes.

22:32.533 --> 22:33.734
I can't believe

22:33.785 --> 22:35.702
they're gonna tear down
the Rivercourt.

22:35.770 --> 22:38.455
It's gonna be so weird
not to have it here.

22:38.539 --> 22:39.823
It's sad.

22:39.908 --> 22:42.108
Like...

22:42.160 --> 22:44.878
Reminds me that we're not
who we used to be anymore.

22:46.881 --> 22:49.216
I got an offer
to go to New York.

22:49.283 --> 22:50.717
What?

22:50.785 --> 22:55.789
A job offer
to move to New York and design.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.107
For who?

22:57.175 --> 22:59.009
Clothes Over Bros.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.094
Is that something
that you'd consider?

23:01.145 --> 23:03.463
Victoria thinks I should.

23:06.567 --> 23:10.771
Maybe it's good that
the Rivercourt will be gone.

23:10.822 --> 23:12.973
When we see it,

23:13.024 --> 23:15.025
it just reminds us
of what's gone...

23:16.978 --> 23:19.446
...Of who we thought we'd be
someday.

23:27.171 --> 23:30.257
"Future home of:
River View Condominiums"?

23:31.960 --> 23:34.378
Former home of
a river view condominiums sign.

23:34.462 --> 23:35.762
I can't believe it.

23:35.830 --> 23:38.331
We've spent
most of our lives out here.

23:38.383 --> 23:40.667
Yeah, every night --
and I mean <i>every</i> night.

23:40.718 --> 23:44.488
We called every game here --
me and...Jimmy.

23:44.555 --> 23:46.339
Maybe there's something
we can do --

23:46.391 --> 23:49.059
find out if it's definitely
happening and how soon.

23:49.127 --> 23:52.729
A lot of living
done right here, bro --

23:52.814 --> 23:54.531
the end of an era.

29:22.744 --> 29:25.379
So, Kellerman came to see me
yesterday.

29:25.463 --> 29:27.581
He admitted
that it was him.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.717
He resigned
his teaching position,

29:29.784 --> 29:32.803
and he offered to pay any costs
associated with the accident,

29:32.870 --> 29:34.421
and he apologized.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.757
He apologized?!

29:36.841 --> 29:38.342
I'm not defending him,
Julian.

29:38.393 --> 29:40.260
I just wanted you to know
what happened.

29:40.345 --> 29:43.314
He said that he was hoping
we wouldn't go to the cops,

29:43.381 --> 29:45.849
but if we did, he would accept
whatever happens.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.568
You see, this is
what I'm talking about, Nate --

29:47.652 --> 29:48.852
so now it's on us?

29:48.903 --> 29:51.689
So I got to feel guilty
if we turn in Kellerman

29:51.740 --> 29:54.024
for getting drunk
and driving like an idiot?

29:54.075 --> 29:56.760
Great!
That's on me now.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.412
And me.

30:01.449 --> 30:02.783
What do you think?

30:02.867 --> 30:04.368
I don't know.
What do <i>you</i> think?

30:04.436 --> 30:07.371
I think Kellerman's life
was academia,

30:07.439 --> 30:09.206
and he just lost that.

30:09.257 --> 30:10.758
But if you want to
turn him in,

30:10.825 --> 30:12.459
I'm completely fine
with that, too.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.845
This has nothing to do
with Ian or Fortitude.

30:14.912 --> 30:17.264
I know that,
but I want to talk to him.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.349
Ian?

30:18.416 --> 30:20.417
August Kellerman.

30:20.468 --> 30:23.920
I want to look him in the eye
and hear his side of things.

30:23.972 --> 30:25.723
I think that's fair.

30:31.379 --> 30:34.565
First off, I want to say "hi"
to my sister Haley.

30:34.616 --> 30:37.117
She's home tonight but,
uh, watching on her webcam.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.653
So, let's all turn around
and say, "hi, Haley!"

30:39.738 --> 30:40.621
Hi, Haley! Hi, Haley!
Hi, Haley! Hi, Haley!

30:42.574 --> 30:44.308
Hi!

30:44.409 --> 30:46.276
Say "hi," Lydia.

30:46.327 --> 30:47.494
Hi!

30:47.579 --> 30:49.430
<i>Perfect.</i>

30:49.497 --> 30:51.048

I've made a lot of mistakes
with you...

34:02.657 --> 34:04.575
And your mother
and in general.

34:04.642 --> 34:05.859
I'm sorry for that.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.494
Well, "sorry"
doesn't fix anything.

34:07.562 --> 34:10.280
They've accepted
my resignation.

34:10.348 --> 34:12.331
I told them I was done,

34:12.417 --> 34:14.067
that my heart wasn't in it
anymore.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.204
But if the accident goes public,
I'll deal with it.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.491
Does any of this matter
to you --

34:21.542 --> 34:23.326
that I loved my work?

34:23.378 --> 34:25.495
Then you shouldn't have
done it.

34:25.545 --> 34:29.299
I miss your mother,
more every day,

34:29.350 --> 34:31.301
but I'm thankful she's not alive
to see this...

34:32.887 --> 34:34.638

what's become of us.

34:36.556 --> 34:38.190

Good luck to you, son.

34:54.158 --> 34:55.742
My name is Julian Baker.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.328
My wife, Brooke,
was in the car you hit.

34:58.396 --> 35:01.665
I'm sorry for that.

35:04.201 --> 35:06.503
And you think
that's enough?

35:06.554 --> 35:08.538
I watched her lungs
fill with water

35:08.589 --> 35:09.890
because of what you did.

35:12.226 --> 35:13.894
I watched
her eyes go dim.

35:16.431 --> 35:18.432
I said I was sorry.

35:18.516 --> 35:20.984
Well,
"sorry" isn't enough.

35:21.052 --> 35:24.438
You insensitive jerk,
that's my wife --

35:24.522 --> 35:26.023
you understand?

35:26.074 --> 35:28.091
I nearly lost my wife.

35:30.061 --> 35:31.445
Nathan
nearly lost his son.

35:31.529 --> 35:32.829
Do you know
what that feels like?!

35:32.914 --> 35:35.398
Yes, I do.

35:35.450 --> 35:37.651
I've <i>lost</i> both.

36:23.376 --> 36:24.542
Hey.

36:24.593 --> 36:28.096
Very nice.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.165
Amazing technique
and showmanship.

36:30.232 --> 36:32.434
So you liked it?
I did.

36:33.702 --> 36:34.919
We're talking about that kiss,
right?

36:37.273 --> 36:39.557
Buy you a root beer?
I'll buy <i>you</i> one.

36:39.608 --> 36:42.811
So, how's that whole "hanging
out with the kid" thing going?

36:42.895 --> 36:44.729
Chuck Skolnick --

36:44.780 --> 36:46.448
he's a good kid
when he's not smarting off

36:46.532 --> 36:47.649
or punching me
in the stomach,

36:47.716 --> 36:49.234
which is most of the time.

36:49.285 --> 36:52.003
Well, I'm sure
he loves hanging out with you.

36:53.272 --> 36:54.906
I know I do.

36:54.974 --> 36:57.275
No, no, no. You don't get to say
flirty things

36:57.326 --> 36:59.744
after that badass performance
up there.

36:59.795 --> 37:01.246
Haven't you heard the whole thing
about a girl and a guitar?

37:01.313 --> 37:03.298
I thought it was
a <i>guy</i> and a guitar.

37:03.382 --> 37:05.967
It's both.
Trust me.

37:06.051 --> 37:07.385
That's you.

37:09.171 --> 37:11.222
I told Mia
you were amazing tonight,

37:11.290 --> 37:14.843
and she says congratulations
and she told you so.

37:14.927 --> 37:18.229
Speaking of girls with guitars,
you talk to Mia much?

37:18.297 --> 37:19.898
Sometimes.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.300
Just friends.

37:22.351 --> 37:25.970
Well, tell her
I said thanks and hi.

37:26.038 --> 37:27.939
Yeah?

37:27.990 --> 37:29.524
Baby steps.

37:31.777 --> 37:32.994
Now what?

37:33.078 --> 37:34.579
Chuck says you're hot.

37:36.482 --> 37:37.999
Awesome.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.033
Cheers.

37:39.118 --> 37:40.118
Cheers.

37:45.157 --> 37:47.675
So, Millie, what's your next
story gonna be about?

37:47.760 --> 37:49.660
I don't know.

37:49.712 --> 37:52.347
Marvin wants me to do an exposé
on the worst airlines.

37:52.431 --> 37:53.798
Oh, that ought to be easy,

37:53.849 --> 37:55.967
considering their airplanes
don't ever leave the airport.

37:57.353 --> 38:00.054
What if you did a piece
on the Rivercourt --

38:00.139 --> 38:02.607
you know, something about
the people who grew up here

38:02.675 --> 38:04.275
and what it means
to the community?

38:06.178 --> 38:08.062
I like it.

38:12.351 --> 38:15.703
♪ When I fall out,
who will leave me? ♪

38:15.788 --> 38:17.372

38:18.857 --> 38:21.042

38:25.197 --> 38:27.715

39:26.758 --> 39:29.594
Hey.

39:29.645 --> 39:32.497
I think you should take that job
in New York.

39:32.565 --> 39:34.983
Would you be okay
with that?

39:35.050 --> 39:36.451
I'd be great with that.

39:36.518 --> 39:37.602
Are you kidding?

39:37.653 --> 39:39.370
I think it'd be good
for both of us.

39:40.956 --> 39:42.290
Getting out of Tree Hill.

39:43.876 --> 39:45.209
What do you think?

39:49.131 --> 39:51.215
I think you're right.

39:51.283 --> 39:54.802
I think we'd be happy
in New York.

40:06.965 --> 40:08.900
So, I guess they accepted
his resignation,

40:08.967 --> 40:09.851
and he's done.

40:09.935 --> 40:11.986
We'll drink to that.

40:12.071 --> 40:13.471
Yeah.
So will I.

40:13.522 --> 40:14.822
We got to step it up,
though.

40:14.907 --> 40:16.574
What's the name
of that baby girl of yours?

40:16.642 --> 40:18.526
I told you -- Lydia.

40:18.611 --> 40:19.977
Mm, Lydia.

40:20.029 --> 40:22.830
Let's get a shot to Lydia.
What's your poison?

40:22.915 --> 40:25.199
Oh, not Tequila.

40:26.702 --> 40:27.869
You know what?
I got this.

40:27.953 --> 40:29.954
Hey, Chase, come here.

40:31.457 --> 40:34.042
Here we go.

40:34.126 --> 40:38.713
♪ She won't even know I'm gone ♪

40:38.797 --> 40:39.997
All right,
changing subjects,

40:40.049 --> 40:41.799
it is looking very strong
for your showcase.

40:41.850 --> 40:45.186
We're expecting at least
a dozen teams to send scouts.

40:45.270 --> 40:47.105
I'll drink to that,
too.

40:47.172 --> 40:47.939
Yeah.

40:48.006 --> 40:49.223
Yes, you will.

40:51.276 --> 40:52.977
Ohh!

40:53.028 --> 40:55.346
Gentlemen...

40:55.397 --> 40:58.232
Here's to Lydia,

40:58.317 --> 41:00.234
here's to my showcase,

41:00.319 --> 41:01.519
and here's to me being rich

41:01.570 --> 41:03.204
by the time I'm as old
as you guys are.

41:04.373 --> 41:06.240
Cheers.

41:06.325 --> 41:08.126
Uh, hold up.
What are we drinking?

41:08.193 --> 41:09.577
It's bourbon.

41:09.662 --> 41:11.579
It's not <i>just</i> bourbon.
It's Phidian's.

41:14.166 --> 41:16.584
It's all I drink.

41:16.669 --> 41:19.053
You hit a car, Kellerman,
on the Gabel Bridge.

41:19.138 --> 41:20.588
Whatever you think you know,

41:20.673 --> 41:22.006
you've made a mistake.

41:22.057 --> 41:24.676
If the accident goes public,
I'll deal with it.

41:24.727 --> 41:26.110
Good luck to you, son.

41:26.178 --> 41:27.395
To me.

41:29.047 --> 41:31.149
Fathers and sons.

41:31.216 --> 41:33.067
It's a shame.
