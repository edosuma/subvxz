00:01.566 --> 00:03.829
<i>Previously on "Reginald the Vampire"...</i>

00:03.916 --> 00:05.527
We can't just let
anyone join our ranks.

00:05.614 --> 00:08.269
And that vampire you made
is an abomination.

00:08.356 --> 00:09.705
Your assessment
is back on the books.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.011
3 and 1/2 days
until our certain doom.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.403
I'm a vampire.

00:12.490 --> 00:15.015
How stupid do you
think that I am?

00:15.102 --> 00:17.930
I'm being reassigned
to the Yukon?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.237
It's everything you need to
know about your assessment.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.978
Holy motherload.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.675
Is that what I think it is?
Angel's blood.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.547
If tonight is your
last night on Earth,

00:25.634 --> 00:26.983
then you should probably
say goodbye to your friends.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.332
What's in the bag?
<i>It's him.</i>

00:28.419 --> 00:29.986
<i>It's Logan the Re-animator.</i>

00:30.073 --> 00:31.727
I thought you'd be fatter.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.598
Reggie's special.
He just hasn't realized it yet.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.426
I had no idea
how amazing I was.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.427
That's his superpower.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.038
You're gonna die.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.430
Reg, you've gotta make me
a vampire.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.302
I think you're
onto something, Todd.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.912
I could be
your secret weapon.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.044
I got a date
with the final puzzle piece.

00:52.530 --> 00:53.662
- You're late.
- Sorry.

00:53.749 --> 00:56.578
Um... here.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.587
Look, I know
there's a difference

01:05.674 --> 01:07.806
between forgiving
and forgetting.

01:10.026 --> 01:12.289
Maybe I can't do one
without the other.

01:12.376 --> 01:15.249
But I know why you did
what you did.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.164
I know your history.

01:17.251 --> 01:20.428
I think I can do that now--

01:20.515 --> 01:23.431
forgive, forget.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.608
Thank you.

01:29.001 --> 01:30.655
Hey.

01:32.004 --> 01:34.311
You gonna be there tomorrow?

01:34.398 --> 01:36.618
- No.
- Why not?

01:38.141 --> 01:40.012
I don't want
to watch you die.

01:52.895 --> 01:55.158
I knew it was you
without even looking.

01:55.245 --> 01:57.595
Sire bond.

01:57.682 --> 02:00.729
Wherever you are,
I know where you are.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.818
And whatever you feel,
I can feel it, too.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.037
Shouldn't that
have worn off by now?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.779
Well, some bonds,
they last longer than others.

02:07.866 --> 02:09.825
Okay.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.392
Tell me what I feel.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.181
They're here.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.936
As duly appointed representative

02:34.023 --> 02:36.068
of the Council of the Americas,

02:36.156 --> 02:39.246
I, LeBron James,
bring with me a warrant

02:39.333 --> 02:40.943
requiring your presence...

02:41.030 --> 02:43.337
Wait, wait, wait.
Your name is LeBron James?

02:43.424 --> 02:46.296
At a meeting
of the Council of the Americas

02:46.383 --> 02:48.820
to determine your suitability
for inclusion

02:48.907 --> 02:50.300
in the vampire population...

02:50.387 --> 02:51.823
Because if I were you,
I'd probably go

02:51.910 --> 02:53.347
by a nickname or something,

02:53.434 --> 02:57.394
like Buddy or Sneaky Pete, Cheekbones.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.788
As measured by
the officially sanctioned

02:59.875 --> 03:03.835
Council assessment, henceforth
referred to as The Assessment.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.708
Or, you know, probably just
never use your last name.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.536
Like, you know there's

03:08.623 --> 03:10.668
a pretty famous basketball
player named LeBron James?

03:10.755 --> 03:12.670
I mean, he was born
right here in Akron.

03:12.757 --> 03:16.021
Said assessment to be held
on this morning

03:16.108 --> 03:19.808
at a time and place ordered
by our glorious leader,

03:19.895 --> 03:21.853
Logan the Impenetrable.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.942
I knew a guy named Ted Cruz.

03:24.029 --> 03:26.336
It made his life a living hell.

03:26.423 --> 03:29.209
How droll.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.908
Joke now. Die later.

03:32.995 --> 03:36.041
Sorry.
Performance anxiety.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.130
Your spawn is very chatty.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
But you have nothing
to say, Maurice?

03:40.307 --> 03:42.222
I don't blame you.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.660
If only you'd cooperated when
we came for you the first time

03:45.747 --> 03:47.270
instead of making
your little scene

03:47.357 --> 03:50.055
and siring this abomination.

03:50.142 --> 03:53.624
But that is
a very different world

03:53.711 --> 03:54.930
than the one we live in now.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.845
Yeah.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.803
Yeah, I'd rather
live in his world

03:58.890 --> 04:01.023
than live without him in mine.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.243
Sweet.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.508
Come with us, Maurice. Blob.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.823
Want me to tell you
how you feel?

04:20.477 --> 04:22.653
You're afraid
you're not enough.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.569
That's how you feel.

04:25.656 --> 04:29.443
Not smart enough to get us
out of this mess

04:29.530 --> 04:32.141
and not brave enough to face
the consequences if you do.

04:32.228 --> 04:35.362
"Not enough" is a feature,
not a bug.

04:37.625 --> 04:40.192
Then why do I believe
in you like I do?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.195
Low standards disorder?

04:43.283 --> 04:46.634
Do you think I can
really pull this off?

04:46.721 --> 04:49.114
I think this is
some of the craziest shit

04:49.201 --> 04:50.899
I've ever seen.

04:50.986 --> 04:53.075
And I've been living
the vampire life for 50 years.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.990
But do you think I can?

04:55.077 --> 04:57.297
Yeah, Reggie.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.255
I do.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.865
Thank you.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.609
My belief in you
doesn't require gratitude.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.090
Not for that.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.311
For saving my life.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.532
Kinda turned you to an undead
creature of the night.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.229
Point taken.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.971
There's definitely negatives
to the lifestyle.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.931
But... I don't know.

05:23.018 --> 05:26.543
My life before
all of this was...

05:26.630 --> 05:28.893
just a car
with spinning wheels.

05:28.980 --> 05:32.506
Maybe this was the life
I was supposed to lead.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.725
Is that weird?

05:36.118 --> 05:37.380
I don't know.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.208
Weird it is pretty
much your brand.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.481
So Vampire Guard,
am I right?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.353
Yeah. Um...

05:53.440 --> 05:55.180
Do you have to go to some
kind of Vampire Guard school

05:55.267 --> 05:57.835
or an academy?

05:57.922 --> 06:00.185
You ever hear of
the Yeoman Warders?

06:01.883 --> 06:03.450
Yeah, right.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.756
They guard the Tower of London
and, uh,

06:05.843 --> 06:07.802
according to one theory,
they're called the Beefeaters

06:07.889 --> 06:09.891
because they were allowed
to eat as much meat

06:09.978 --> 06:11.109
as they wanted to
when they dined with the king.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.024
Oh, right.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.636
Okay, picking up the pace.
I totally get it.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.464
I mean, I'm in no rush,
for obvious reasons.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.728
But hey, wouldn't want to
be late for my own--oof.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.078
Party.

06:26.168 --> 06:29.606
It is my great
and lasting honor

06:29.693 --> 06:34.655
to announce the presence
of Logan the Unquenchable.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.273
Whoa.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.901
My good vampires,
regional directors,

07:03.988 --> 07:06.034
the very best of our kind,

07:06.121 --> 07:08.558
we are gathered here today

07:08.645 --> 07:11.605
to evaluate
and assess the fitness

07:11.692 --> 07:15.609
of the newborn vampire
you see before you.

07:15.696 --> 07:19.787
The vampire known
as Reginald Andres.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.925
Mere decades ago...

07:33.757 --> 07:36.281
A blink of an eye
in the lives we lead,

07:36.368 --> 07:38.545
even less for those of us
fortunate enough

07:38.632 --> 07:41.809
to measure
our biography in centuries,

07:41.896 --> 07:43.288
it was determined

07:43.375 --> 07:45.987
that a kind of culling
was required,

07:46.074 --> 07:49.599
a way to shape
and perfect our race.

07:49.686 --> 07:52.776
And so the first Assessment
was held.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.778
And subsequent to that,

07:54.865 --> 07:58.042
every newborn vampire
participated in it

07:58.129 --> 08:00.828
in order to guarantee
our future,

08:00.915 --> 08:06.311
and to do so according to the
laws that bind and protect us.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.531
On a personal note,

08:08.618 --> 08:11.708
like many of you,
I was made

08:11.795 --> 08:15.625
long before The Assessment
came into being.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.322
But I have seen the benefit,

08:17.409 --> 08:23.198
seen how our species
has improved and evolved.

08:23.285 --> 08:26.070
Once, we were a race
united by our thirst,

08:26.157 --> 08:27.898
but only our thirst.

08:27.985 --> 08:31.728
Now, in this modern age,

08:31.815 --> 08:37.342
we are approaching
a kind of species divinity.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.083
Hey, yo, Deacon?

08:39.170 --> 08:40.476
Could we get
this show on the road?

08:40.563 --> 08:42.652
I got dinner plans.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.917
Fair warning.

08:47.004 --> 08:49.572
The Assessment is
of great meaning for us.

08:49.659 --> 08:54.359
It's as close to a holy ritual
as we maintain.

08:54.446 --> 08:58.320
Scorn it, ridicule it
at your own peril,

08:58.407 --> 09:02.367
if only because the amount
of pain and consequence

09:02.454 --> 09:05.675
you suffer after you fail

09:05.762 --> 09:08.373
is in direct proportion

09:08.460 --> 09:11.115
to how much you piss me off

09:11.202 --> 09:13.857
along the way!

09:13.944 --> 09:16.773
Look, I'm not here to be
a party poop or anything,

09:16.860 --> 09:19.123
but come on, man.
We're gonna be here all week

09:19.210 --> 09:21.212
if you don't cut it
with the yakety-yak.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.562
Oh.

09:24.738 --> 09:29.699
Very well. It is my distinct
pleasure to announce

09:29.786 --> 09:33.703
that the vampiric abilities
and potential assessment,

09:33.790 --> 09:36.140
henceforth known as
The Assessment,

09:36.227 --> 09:38.578
shall begin!

09:42.059 --> 09:44.366
Let there be bells.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.413
This dude puts
the D in douchebag.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.209
Hey.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.429
Hey.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.127
Ready?

10:08.346 --> 10:11.523
Visualize,
actualize, achieve.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.570
Defying Gravity.

10:14.657 --> 10:18.052
Visualize,
actualize, achieve.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.227
Um, you have to defy gravity.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.794
- I'm on it.
- Mm-hmm.

10:20.881 --> 10:23.187
Okay.

10:23.274 --> 10:26.321
Three, two, one.

10:29.411 --> 10:32.153
5 inches.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.503
Aw, wait, wait.
Come on, come on.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.331
I can do this.
Let me do it again.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.246
If you wish. A do-over.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.729
Okay.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.209
Really?

10:46.384 --> 10:48.735
4 inches.

10:48.822 --> 10:51.085
It's really pretty amazing
when you think about it.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.913
Fail.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.003
<i>The Dubious Arm-Bender.</i>

10:56.090 --> 10:57.395
<i>Fail.</i>

10:57.482 --> 10:59.136
<i>Identifying the Cheese.</i>

10:59.223 --> 11:00.311
<i>Fail.</i>

11:06.404 --> 11:08.885
Catch the Orb.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.323
You must catch the orb
before it hits the ground.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.847
I figured that out
all by myself,

11:13.934 --> 11:15.326
thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.981
On my mark.

11:18.068 --> 11:21.506
Three, two, one.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.209
Wrong shoes.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.734
Fail.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.001
<i>The Lonely Goatherd.</i>

11:38.088 --> 11:39.437
<i>Fail.</i>

11:39.524 --> 11:40.961
<i>Hell is Other People.</i>

11:41.048 --> 11:42.179
<i>Fail!</i>

11:42.266 --> 11:44.138
<i>They All Fall Down.</i>

11:44.225 --> 11:46.531
Ooh, ah.
Little known fact--

11:46.618 --> 11:48.185
there's a right way
and a wrong way

11:48.272 --> 11:49.883
to knock down the bottles,

11:49.970 --> 11:51.754
though the solution
may seem counterintuitive.

11:51.841 --> 11:55.062
But that's the point, right?
That's why no one ever wins.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.283
We assume the best place
to throw the ball

11:59.370 --> 12:00.850
is right at the middle.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.026
But as the bottom bottles
are weighted,

12:03.113 --> 12:04.767
that'll never knock them down.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.335
So we need to rely
on accuracy more than power.

12:07.422 --> 12:10.468
What you have to do is aim
between the two middle bottles

12:10.555 --> 12:12.340
on the bottom row.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.045
I once won
ten oversized teddy bears

12:22.132 --> 12:24.091
in one single night.

12:25.657 --> 12:26.746
Pass.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.880
Yeah. Yeah.

12:30.967 --> 12:34.188
Yeah. Yeah.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.842
Yeah.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.021
<i>A Fiendish Jumble. Pass.</i>

12:41.108 --> 12:43.371
<i>Name That Room. Pass.</i>

12:43.458 --> 12:47.114
The Finger Trap of Sorrow.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.550
Seriously?

12:48.637 --> 12:50.421
Does anyone ever fail this?

12:50.508 --> 12:53.947
I don't know why he says
that it's virtually impossible.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.601
Pass.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.604
The Golden Ratio.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.566
I'm sorry, but the hairline
to the upper eyelid

13:04.653 --> 13:08.135
should be 1.618 times the
length of the upper eyebrow

13:08.222 --> 13:09.571
to the lower eyelid,
but I mean,

13:09.658 --> 13:10.964
I just don't even know.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.096
Really?
This is just insulting.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.142
Fail!

13:16.491 --> 13:18.406
<i>After a very long day</i>

13:18.493 --> 13:21.801
<i>filled with failure
and some success,</i>

13:21.888 --> 13:25.456
<i>two tests remain.</i>

13:25.543 --> 13:28.503
Death's Sharp Sting.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.461
If he fails this test,

13:30.548 --> 13:33.160
he'll be
mathematically eliminated--

13:33.247 --> 13:36.250
and of course,
tortured and killed,

13:36.337 --> 13:38.643
along with you.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.036
I almost forgot.

13:43.735 --> 13:46.086
You must carry the nest
from one podium to the other.

13:46.173 --> 13:49.306
If you are stung, you fail.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.095
Little known fact.

13:55.182 --> 13:58.054
Bees--even hornets--

13:58.141 --> 14:00.927
are not evil,
like some monsters I know.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.712
They defend their home
when they perceive a threat.

14:03.799 --> 14:07.716
If you swat at them or do
some violent gesture to them,

14:07.803 --> 14:09.544
they will read that as trouble,

14:09.631 --> 14:12.808
and that encourages
them to sting.

14:13.765 --> 14:17.465
Now, most insects get their
cues from smells in the air--

14:17.552 --> 14:19.162
your own breath.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.338
That informs them
that you're near.

14:21.425 --> 14:25.734
But if you were to hold your
breath for 10, 30, 50 seconds,

14:25.821 --> 14:28.650
they will no longer detect you.

14:28.737 --> 14:32.175
They will leave you in peace...

14:32.262 --> 14:33.873
like so.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.369
Pass.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.204
Silence.

15:44.291 --> 15:47.163
There is only
one test remaining.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.471
It will decide
whether you live or you die.

15:50.558 --> 15:54.257
And I am thinking that you
will die in the most

15:54.344 --> 15:57.347
horrible--
- Bring it on, old man.

15:57.434 --> 15:58.740
I'm ready to do this.

16:07.879 --> 16:12.710
The Claw of Impossibility.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.522
Hey.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.002
I'm really sorry.

16:44.351 --> 16:47.136
- I appreciate the support.
- Yeah.

16:47.223 --> 16:51.227
The Claw of Impossibility.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.795
Do you just like
hearing yourself talk?

16:53.882 --> 16:55.753
You have 60 seconds.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.541
Okay.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.369
Uh, all right.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.726
Just calmly--okay.
Yeah, right there.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.252
Okay, cool.
That was a--

17:16.339 --> 17:17.906
that was just a mistake,
I feel like.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.387
Keep going, okay.

17:20.474 --> 17:21.562
Focus.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.651
45 seconds.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.222
Holy [mutters].

17:29.309 --> 17:31.702
Okay, I got this one.
I got this one.

17:35.532 --> 17:39.232
Ah.
Hello, Mr. Horse.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.408
I'm gonna get you a new home.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.105
Sarah lives there.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.368
She'll take great care
of you...

17:45.455 --> 17:47.327
lucky horse.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.719
Okay.

17:48.806 --> 17:52.375
25 seconds.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.554
Ohh.

17:57.641 --> 17:58.816
Okay.

17:58.903 --> 18:01.167
You have 10 seconds.

18:01.254 --> 18:03.821
Focus. Calm hands.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.736
Oh, my God.
I got it. I got it!

18:09.784 --> 18:11.264
This is it. Okay.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.222
Okay, okay.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.445
spectators: Oh!

18:18.532 --> 18:19.620
Fail!

18:19.707 --> 18:20.925
God damn it.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.668
Sorry you couldn't
get to meet Sarah.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.496
She's the best girl
in the world.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.891
This brings to an end
The Assessment.

18:29.978 --> 18:33.677
The subject, Reginald Andres,
does not pass.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.070
He is not worthy.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.767
He is not one of us.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.292
He is defective

18:39.379 --> 18:42.947
and an insult to the purity
that binds us together.

18:43.034 --> 18:46.647
Prepare the Chamber of the Sun.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.266
Welcome to the penalty phase
of The Assessment.

18:57.353 --> 19:01.531
We will begin
with a little light torture--

19:01.618 --> 19:04.665
as much or as little
as I command.

19:04.752 --> 19:07.929
After this appetizing
spectacle concludes,

19:08.016 --> 19:11.062
we will let the sunshine in

19:11.150 --> 19:15.502
and be rid
of this pestilent aberration.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.808
Oh, for----'s sake,
bring it on.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.463
Do not be impatient, blob.

19:20.550 --> 19:24.902
The end of your eternal life
will come soon enough.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.514
But it is not enough
for you to die.

19:27.601 --> 19:31.082
Your entire bloodline,
your progeny,

19:31.170 --> 19:32.823
must die with you.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.176
Bring in the progeny.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.876
I don't have any progeny.
He's not a vampire!

19:43.791 --> 19:46.054
No. No!

19:48.012 --> 19:50.276
You thought
you could fool us?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.018
Todd never hurt anybody.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.064
It's my fault.
I did this.

19:56.151 --> 19:59.546
Todd Sleater, aged
28 human years when turned.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.070
Vampire, age of one day.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.638
Hereby sentenced to death
as tainted blood

20:04.725 --> 20:06.379
in conjunction
with the sentencing

20:06.466 --> 20:07.858
of Reginald Andres.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.686
I would like to
formally thank

20:09.773 --> 20:13.386
the recently demoted director
of the Midwest region

20:13.473 --> 20:16.040
for making
this special moment possible.

20:16.127 --> 20:19.218
Your service
is greatly appreciated.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.871
You----ing bitch.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.657
I'm reminded, as his sire,

20:23.744 --> 20:25.702
that you will shortly
join the roundish one

20:25.789 --> 20:27.878
in death.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.272
Interrupt the ceremony
a second time,

20:30.359 --> 20:33.841
and you will die before him.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.540
I'm sorry, Reg.
I-I tried to save you.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.107
I tried to follow the plan.

20:39.194 --> 20:42.023
She stopped me.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.641
<i>The death of your spawn</i>

20:51.728 --> 20:54.557
<i>is not the only penalty
to be paid.</i>

20:54.644 --> 20:59.649
<i>As is customary and necessary
to the survival of our kind,</i>

20:59.736 --> 21:02.826
any human that knows
your secret must die

21:02.913 --> 21:05.829
<i>on the day that you die.</i>

21:05.916 --> 21:08.571
<i>It has come to my attention--
and again,</i>

21:08.658 --> 21:10.965
big shout-out
to the former director

21:11.052 --> 21:12.662
of the Midwest region--

21:12.749 --> 21:15.578
<i>that there are
two such humans,</i>

21:15.665 --> 21:19.887
<i>and their names
are Sarah and Claire.</i>

21:19.974 --> 21:20.975
<i>No.</i>

21:21.062 --> 21:23.412
Please, don't do this.

21:23.499 --> 21:26.372
I deserve to die,
but not them.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.548
Please, I'll do anything.

21:28.635 --> 21:31.290
You will only do one thing.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.422
You will die.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.816
And they will die with you.

21:35.903 --> 21:36.904
--- you!

21:38.732 --> 21:41.387
I haven't been
a vampire for very long,

21:41.474 --> 21:43.563
just a collection of days--
that's it.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.956
But that's all I needed
to know about you.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.569
You're empty.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.180
You're vain.
You're cruel.

21:52.267 --> 21:55.662
The last creatures on Earth
deserving eternity.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.447
Life is a finger trap,
and you're too stupid

21:58.534 --> 22:00.057
to see the beauty in it.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.059
That's why you're really dead.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.844
Dead and sentenced

22:03.931 --> 22:06.063
to an endless parade
of wasted years.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.501
But forever's a long time.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.895
Eventually,
time will catch up with you,

22:11.982 --> 22:15.334
because you are the past,

22:15.421 --> 22:17.858
and I am the future.

22:22.036 --> 22:24.473
Torture him now!

22:24.560 --> 22:27.607
Let the torture begin!

23:23.358 --> 23:25.404
Time to die, little girl.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.632
Holy shitballs.

23:36.719 --> 23:39.330
Just one cut--

23:39.418 --> 23:42.682
a cut that heals, but painful.

23:42.769 --> 23:45.815
Then a second cut.

23:45.902 --> 23:49.166
Then a third, each cut healing.

23:49.253 --> 23:52.474
And as many cuts as I determine

23:52.561 --> 23:55.695
before your torture is ended.

23:55.782 --> 23:59.133
You will die many deaths
before your true death,

23:59.220 --> 24:02.179
a death that you will welcome,
if only

24:02.266 --> 24:04.399
to end all this pain.

24:06.793 --> 24:11.493
But your final passing
will see your progeny burn

24:11.580 --> 24:13.452
as we let the sun shine in.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.979
Cut him.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.651
Enough!

24:38.738 --> 24:40.740
Is that all?
Cut me!

24:42.437 --> 24:44.352
Deeper. No mercy.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.879
Let the sun shine in.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.147
What is that?

24:57.234 --> 24:58.801
Oh, right.

24:58.888 --> 25:01.456
Sorry, I forgot
that was in there.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.953
Surprise, vampires!

25:20.040 --> 25:22.259
I'm still a human.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.392
Burn, vampires, burn!

25:26.307 --> 25:27.961
Off with his head.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.968
Thank you.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.884
You're on your own now.
Good luck, vampire.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.935
You're gonna want to take
cover for this next part.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.286
Aah!

25:49.373 --> 25:50.853
Angel's blood!

25:58.861 --> 26:00.820
Aah!

26:09.393 --> 26:11.657
Uh-oh, I'm out. Shit.

26:15.095 --> 26:20.361
I am Logan,
pure and powerful.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.493
Did you honestly think

26:22.581 --> 26:24.974
that you could kill me--

26:33.635 --> 26:36.029
As is mandated by our custom,

26:36.116 --> 26:37.683
I claim deaconship

26:37.770 --> 26:39.902
of the Council of the Americas henceforth.

26:39.989 --> 26:43.558
And as deacon,
my first official act

26:43.645 --> 26:47.040
is to pardon the prisoner
Reginald Andres.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.476
Yeah, you do.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.535
She killed the assassins.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.189
They didn't even make it inside.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.548
Welcome to the Slushy Shack.
How may I help you?

27:20.987 --> 27:22.466
You're still you.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.904
- Is that a problem?
- I don't think so.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.302
You did it.

27:32.389 --> 27:34.087
Not me.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.438
He did.

27:37.525 --> 27:38.918
I got a thing
with the final puzzle piece.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.224
Where?
Wait, what is it? Reggie!

27:45.272 --> 27:46.577
Hey, Angie.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.667
Can I come in?

27:48.754 --> 27:51.234
I think it's time
we have a little talk.

27:54.237 --> 27:57.501
So how will they know
I'm not still human?

27:57.588 --> 28:01.070
Because for all they know,
you're a newly-turned vampire,

28:01.157 --> 28:04.334
and newly-turned vampires
still have human blood in them.

28:04.421 --> 28:07.686
So all you have to do
is deliver him.

28:07.773 --> 28:11.211
And all you have to do
is sob like you mean it.

28:11.298 --> 28:13.039
And you'll have to
make Logan angry--

28:13.126 --> 28:14.823
like, really angry.

28:14.910 --> 28:18.653
Because the angrier he gets,
the worse the torture.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.350
The deeper the cuts.

28:20.437 --> 28:21.700
I can do that.

28:28.750 --> 28:32.232
Do you think I'm gonna need
a little more Angel's blood?

28:32.319 --> 28:34.060
I'm a first time shooter,
long-time pacifist.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.801
No, that's enough.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.107
Okay, you've got one target
and one target only,

28:38.194 --> 28:40.457
and that's Logan the Cockroach.

28:51.555 --> 28:52.818
Reggie, this is gonna hurt.

28:52.905 --> 28:54.515
- Don't worry.
- You sure, man?

28:58.214 --> 29:01.087
I was made for this.

29:13.142 --> 29:15.318
Well, that was a hoot.

29:15.405 --> 29:16.842
Logan is dust.

29:16.929 --> 29:19.583
Reginald won the day.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.238
Maurice is the new deacon
of the Council of the Americas.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.285
And I am what I was before--

29:25.372 --> 29:29.637
reinstated, the director
of the Midwest region,

29:29.724 --> 29:32.858
and not to mention,
your worst nightmare.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.424
I don't know
what I was thinking.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.775
It was a momentary
lapse of reason,

29:36.862 --> 29:38.777
some sort of witchcraft.

29:38.864 --> 29:41.388
- Let us live.
- Forgive us.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.433
- Please.
- Please.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.001
Well, I suppose
the company is preferable

29:46.088 --> 29:47.960
to me wandering
around this big old house

29:48.047 --> 29:49.570
like a ghost.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.180
And you do have your uses,

29:51.267 --> 29:53.139
despite your traitorous instincts.

29:53.226 --> 29:54.531
Thank you.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.969
We will do anything.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.928
Fair enough.
If that bitch survived,

30:00.015 --> 30:03.062
find Eve and bring her to me.

30:03.149 --> 30:06.500
And then I'll rip out her heart
and feed it to her.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.421
<i>♪ The beautiful corner... ♪</i>

30:14.508 --> 30:16.553
Big day.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.294
The best.

30:18.381 --> 30:21.645
Were you 100% sure
your plan was gonna work?

30:21.732 --> 30:23.430
Nope.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.171
Okay, now you tell me.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.869
But I had a pretty good idea.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.740
It turns out believing
in your friends

30:29.828 --> 30:32.047
is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.485
- I'm your friend.
- Right?

30:35.572 --> 30:37.618
- Oh...
- How weird is that?

30:37.705 --> 30:39.663
I mean, a lot of crazy
shit has happened recently,

30:39.750 --> 30:43.015
but that's just--whoa.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.538
I'm glad we're friends, too.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.933
Thanks, man.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.238
Yeah, buddy.

30:49.325 --> 30:52.459
<i>♪ The candle-lit table ♪</i>

30:52.546 --> 30:54.330
<i>♪ As we cut loose... ♪</i>

30:54.417 --> 30:56.115
- Turn me.
- I'm sorry, what?

30:56.202 --> 30:58.421
- Make me like you.
- Todd, we've been over this.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.423
Come on, man. I put my life
on the line for you.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.164
True.
But that's all the more reason

31:02.251 --> 31:03.731
for me to protect it.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.167
Dude, I would make
an awesome vampire.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.777
You know it.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.432
- Okay, probably also true.
- Right?

31:09.519 --> 31:11.957
But...[sighs] dude,

31:12.044 --> 31:13.872
th-that's something
I can't deal with right now.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.048
The responsibility of it.
- Turn me.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.180
Asking me over and over

31:18.267 --> 31:20.922
is not gonna increase your
chances of me changing my mind.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.361
Although it is nice
to be reminded

31:25.448 --> 31:27.886
of how I used to ask my mom
for a new bike.

31:29.670 --> 31:33.152
<i>♪ Make me feel so high... ♪</i>

31:33.239 --> 31:35.894
Maybe I will go see her sometime.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.118
So you're the top dog now,
deacon or something?

31:43.205 --> 31:44.598
Yeah.

31:44.685 --> 31:47.731
Kill the deacon,
take his or her chair.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.472
Kinda how it works.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.431
Very impressive.
Do you get a special hat?

31:52.388 --> 31:53.955
Not that I know of.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.696
You should have
a special hat.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.611
It'll make you stand
out in the crowd.

32:01.093 --> 32:03.443
Hey, you mind
if I ask you something?

32:03.530 --> 32:05.445
No.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.403
Reginald stashed you
at the tanning salon,

32:07.490 --> 32:09.144
put you there for
your own safety

32:09.231 --> 32:11.755
because the UV rays
would protect you.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.410
Logan sent assassins after you
like he sent them here.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.151
Well, how close
did they get to you?

32:18.414 --> 32:20.503
Pretty close.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.071
Claire, talk to me.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.249
They turned off the power.

32:27.336 --> 32:29.077
So no more tanning bed.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.558
- They found me.
- But how did you--

32:34.300 --> 32:36.780
Okay, um--

32:36.867 --> 32:38.478
How long have you been able
to do that?

32:38.565 --> 32:41.046
It's sort of been coming on
for a while.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.438
Now it's here.

32:42.525 --> 32:45.093
Okay.
Hey, you know what?

32:45.180 --> 32:48.662
Maybe, uh, you and I should
have a talk about that.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.577
Yeah?
- Okay.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.057
Okay.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.670
How old are you?

32:56.757 --> 32:58.411
Does it matter?

32:58.498 --> 33:01.805
Genuinely curious is all.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.851
I was born
on the day Mount Fuji erupted

33:03.938 --> 33:06.332
and blew fire and smoke
into the bluest of skies.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.203
1707?

33:10.901 --> 33:12.294
- How old are you?
- I was born

33:12.381 --> 33:14.340
on the day they broke ground

33:14.427 --> 33:17.560
for the largest shopping mall
in America.

33:17.647 --> 33:20.476
It's in Minnesota,
where I was born.

33:20.563 --> 33:23.175
Can I ask you a series
of probing questions?

33:23.262 --> 33:25.655
Why aren't you afraid of me?

33:25.742 --> 33:28.093
Why would I be afraid
of a friend?

33:31.487 --> 33:33.098
Ask me anything.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.969
- Are werewolves real?
- No.

33:35.056 --> 33:36.318
- Can vampires fly?
- I wish.

33:36.405 --> 33:37.972
So you don't turn into a bat?

33:38.059 --> 33:39.800
Why would anyone want
to turn into a bat?

33:39.887 --> 33:41.323
- Point taken.
- Hmm.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.934
Holy water--
turns out, can't hurt you.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.936
I once drank the blood
of a priest in Florence.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.200
- Garlic?
- Delicious if used correctly

33:48.287 --> 33:49.723
in many of my favorite meals.

33:49.810 --> 33:50.854
Are you sure
werewolves aren't real?

33:50.941 --> 33:52.291
Because I've got a feeling.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.206
- Can I ask a question?
- Sure.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.251
Do you want to go for a
long walk in the dark with me?

33:56.338 --> 33:58.558
Oh, yes I do.

34:10.439 --> 34:12.441
Go on, it's awesome.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.182
I've never had
a slushy before.

34:14.269 --> 34:15.966
Oh. Well, there's
a first time for everything.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.144
Cheers.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.544
Eh?
Like I said, right?

34:29.415 --> 34:32.331
It's... awful.

34:32.418 --> 34:35.464
Ugh.
- Oh. Um...

34:35.551 --> 34:37.423
Crap. Well, let me get
you another flavor.

34:37.510 --> 34:40.034
No. No, no.
I'm good, thanks.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.427
Okay.

34:45.213 --> 34:47.650
Mm.

34:50.305 --> 34:53.526
So... you're a vampire.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.963
You're not.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.660
Yeah.

34:57.747 --> 35:00.185
Well, I keep telling people
I should be.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.666
- "People"?
- Yeah, Reginald, Maurice.

35:03.753 --> 35:05.451
They don't listen to me.

35:05.538 --> 35:08.845
I mean, again, to repeat:
I'm in great shape.

35:08.932 --> 35:11.065
I'm easy on the eyes.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.415
I pretty much meet every
existing vampire standard.

35:13.502 --> 35:15.635
Reginald and Maurice
might have something

35:15.722 --> 35:17.115
to say about those standards.

35:17.202 --> 35:18.377
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, totally.

35:18.464 --> 35:19.856
Of course.

35:19.943 --> 35:22.032
And I support them
in their efforts.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.731
But, uh, you get my drift.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.646
I get your drift.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.565
Please make me a vampire
like you.

35:32.652 --> 35:35.089
I promise I will honor
every day,

35:35.176 --> 35:38.527
every moment
of my eternal life.

35:40.573 --> 35:42.009
Okay.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.359
- Sorry, what'd you say?
- I said, "Okay."

35:44.446 --> 35:46.840
I just asked if you'd
turn me into a vampire,

35:46.927 --> 35:48.885
and you are cool with it?

35:48.972 --> 35:50.583
Not tonight.

35:50.670 --> 35:52.411
Not tomorrow.

35:52.498 --> 35:55.501
Let's take it slow,
see what happens.

36:04.858 --> 36:07.034
Uh...

36:07.121 --> 36:08.688
I'm--I'm really sorry.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.080
I don't know what
happened there.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.257
Did you glamour me to do that?

36:12.344 --> 36:14.433
No, no.
That doesn't make sense.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.305
Uh, just, uh, I think I got
caught up in the moment.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.873
There was like a connection,
a vibe, you know?

36:19.960 --> 36:21.570
You were like,
"Oh, I'll make you vampire."

36:21.657 --> 36:23.572
I'm like, "Oh, of course."

36:23.659 --> 36:25.487
I don't know what I
was thinking, man.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.315
No worries, Todd.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.056
You've got a lot to learn.

36:48.902 --> 36:50.425
Who are you?

36:50.512 --> 36:53.994
I'm Uriel, one of seven.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.039
And we are your makers.

36:58.694 --> 37:00.435
You're Angels.

37:00.522 --> 37:04.396
You are emissaries
of the golden divine.

37:04.483 --> 37:06.572
I kneel before you.

37:06.659 --> 37:09.879
I welcome you.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.881
You're here to save us.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.622
No.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.321
We are here to eradicate
a grievous mistake we made

37:16.408 --> 37:18.845
and must now correct.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.325
Mistake?

37:31.249 --> 37:32.337
It's a start.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.998
Look at them.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.566
I got a rule
about friends and family.

37:44.653 --> 37:46.307
Pssh--I don't know.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.744
It feels like you got both now.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.703
It feels like it.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.531
- We're gonna be busy.
- Yeah.

37:52.618 --> 37:55.403
What do you got in mind?
- Change.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.406
We can make
a brand-new world for vampires.

37:58.493 --> 38:00.278
- It won't be easy.
- It never is.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.021
Well, where do
you want to start?

38:05.108 --> 38:09.983
Um, vampires can
no longer limit themselves

38:10.070 --> 38:12.768
by shunning those
who are different than them,

38:12.855 --> 38:16.555
especially when it comes to
shapes and sizes and colors

38:16.642 --> 38:18.470
and points of view.

38:18.557 --> 38:20.428
We can do that, right?

38:20.515 --> 38:23.692
Reggie, I'm the deacon of the
Americas, man, not the planet.

38:23.779 --> 38:26.608
Then we'll lead
the rest of them by example.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.523
We have a chance to rebuild
the vampire community

38:28.610 --> 38:29.959
from the ground up--

38:30.046 --> 38:31.918
or crypt up, I guess.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.789
Is that actually a thing?

38:33.876 --> 38:36.444
Reggie, that's a tall order.

38:36.531 --> 38:37.619
Look, the world
we're trying to build--

38:37.706 --> 38:38.968
it won't be built overnight.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.361
Well, we got time.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.886
Good night, man.

38:43.973 --> 38:46.019
Where are you going?
It's a party.

38:46.106 --> 38:48.282
Yeah. No, I know.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.284
I just got
a lot to think about.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.807
I think better when I walk.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.299
Maurice?

39:05.386 --> 39:07.388
Question.

39:07.475 --> 39:09.259
Okay.

39:09.347 --> 39:13.089
How many years, or decades,
or centuries

39:13.176 --> 39:16.136
does it take
for one to forgive?

39:18.007 --> 39:20.053
I don't know.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.534
But it's come to mind lately.

39:22.621 --> 39:25.232
Me and forgiveness.

39:25.319 --> 39:28.366
So you're in charge now.

39:28.453 --> 39:31.151
Yeah, looks like it.

39:31.238 --> 39:33.240
You gonna break
those mother-------?

39:35.764 --> 39:38.245
What we have here
is already broken.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.725
I'm gonna fix it.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.335
Ah, justice.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.165
Turns out I missed it.

39:47.515 --> 39:48.995
What about you, Angela?

39:49.082 --> 39:51.389
No.
I just love the game.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.956
You know I'm coming
for you, right?

39:54.043 --> 39:56.219
Sooner or later.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.917
Yeah.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.875
Yep.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.790
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

40:05.011 --> 40:08.754
I prayed for a different
life in this exact spot.

40:10.495 --> 40:11.974
I prayed here, too.

40:13.498 --> 40:14.629
Really?

40:16.979 --> 40:18.503
What did you pray for?

40:21.462 --> 40:24.639
I'll tell you about
it someday... promise.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.774
You know, in theory,
this should be

40:28.861 --> 40:30.993
the best day of my life.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.995
You sound like it's not.

40:35.737 --> 40:40.263
The best day of my life
was the day we first met.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.875
Oh, Reginald.

40:42.962 --> 40:45.443
If there's anything
I can do to get us back

40:45.530 --> 40:48.271
to where we were, I'll do it.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.317
Like, if there's some
sequence of words

40:50.404 --> 40:55.453
that act like a magic spell,
I will do that, too.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.107
I mean, it'll take me
a while to write it up, but...

41:02.242 --> 41:04.462
Nothing matters
if I lost you.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.118
Pretty much my baseline.

41:09.205 --> 41:11.469
But I'm human,
and you're not.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.558
True. Ha.

41:13.645 --> 41:19.477
You touched my heart,
and then you broke it.

41:20.521 --> 41:22.523
True.

41:22.610 --> 41:27.397
I accept the first
and forgive the second.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.704
That's great news.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.358
But--

41:31.445 --> 41:33.534
There's always a "but,"
in my experience.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.275
Go on.

41:38.887 --> 41:42.935
I don't know what
to do now or next.

41:45.241 --> 41:47.679
There's a lot
that I need to figure out.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.509
And that's about you,

41:51.596 --> 41:55.164
but it's about
other stuff, too.

41:57.645 --> 42:01.997
And for that,
I'll just need time.

42:02.084 --> 42:06.524
Say I have a chance,
and I'll wait forever.

42:07.916 --> 42:09.701
