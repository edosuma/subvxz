00:19.916 --> 00:23.332
BASED ON TRUE EVENTS

01:41.500 --> 01:47.082
RESCUE UNDER FIRE

03:46.333 --> 03:47.415
Abda, cut his shirt.

03:47.625 --> 03:48.624
Yes, ma'am.

03:49.916 --> 03:51.165
He's not breathing.

03:55.958 --> 03:56.582
Shit.

03:57.583 --> 03:58.290
Damn it!

03:58.458 --> 04:00.040
- IV ready.
- The Guedel won't go in.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.249
He's full of shrapnel.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.290
First get him breathing.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.374
We'll check inside after.

04:11.541 --> 04:12.790
- We'll do a crico.
- Okay.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.457
We're taking fire!

04:17.625 --> 04:19.332
- Isabel, hurry up!
- One second, please.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.624
Sobrino, talk to me!

04:20.833 --> 04:22.290
I can't see anything, damn it!

04:22.625 --> 04:23.290
Shit.

04:24.708 --> 04:25.499
Hold on!

04:25.791 --> 04:26.374
I'm cutting.

04:28.666 --> 04:29.249
Let's go!

04:29.416 --> 04:30.332
Give me a minute, Luis.

04:31.583 --> 04:32.082
We're leaving!

04:32.291 --> 04:33.124
Hold on, please!

04:34.833 --> 04:36.540
Quickly!

04:45.958 --> 04:47.040
Fuck!

05:04.750 --> 05:05.499
Now, Isabel!

05:05.708 --> 05:07.332
Captain! Captain!

05:13.708 --> 05:15.582
Hold on, hold on.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.332
I've got it.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.665
Come on.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.457
No, no, no.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.749
Shit.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.290
Come on.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.207
He's a wreck.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.999
He's not breathing, he's too messed up.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.540
Shit!

06:13.875 --> 06:15.499
- Abda, with me.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:18.666 --> 07:19.665
Yeah.

07:20.250 --> 07:23.165
Let's both calm down,
I'm not upset.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.665
Yeah, but I say no to buying him

07:25.833 --> 07:28.957
a cell phone until he's 12
and you go and buy him one.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.582
No, look, anything
can be justified.

07:42.541 --> 07:44.665
Whatever you want.

07:45.291 --> 07:46.665
Okay, I will.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.999
Your sister sends you a hug.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.499
Fine with me.

07:53.875 --> 07:55.624
What time did we land?

07:55.916 --> 07:57.665
At 14:03.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.540
Go get some rest,
I still have a while left.

08:10.750 --> 08:11.624
I'll wait for you.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.290
No, don't wait for me.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.499
See you tomorrow.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.332
See you tomorrow.

09:20.916 --> 09:26.207
HERAT MILITARY BASE
AFGHANISTAN, AUGUST 12TH, 2012

09:31.250 --> 09:33.499
Good morning, Captain.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.415
Good morning.

09:44.875 --> 09:45.832
Thank you.

09:57.291 --> 09:57.957
Captain.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.207
Captain.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.457
This is the new nurse,
Private Sanchez.

10:06.666 --> 10:08.374
- Morning, Captain.
- Welcome.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.249
- When did you arrive?
- One hour ago.

10:10.416 --> 10:11.957
We were expecting you
yesterday.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.624
Your first mission in Afghanistan?

10:13.791 --> 10:14.790
Yes, Captain.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.624
What experience do you have?

10:19.791 --> 10:22.624
As a civilian I worked at a clinic

10:23.083 --> 10:24.499
in Borne, in Barcelona,

10:24.666 --> 10:26.707
and when I enlisted they sent me
to Intensive Care.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.707
- Good place to learn.
- Morning, Captain.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.499
Private Sobrino, gunner.
Private Sanchez, nurse.

10:31.958 --> 10:32.915
- Welcome.
- How are you?

10:33.250 --> 10:35.374
Medical experience in combat?

10:36.541 --> 10:37.707
No.

10:43.916 --> 10:46.457
Do you have any other name
besides Private Sanchez?

10:46.833 --> 10:48.457
Raquel, Captain.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.415
Have you had breakfast,
Raquel?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.415
- Yes, on the plane.
- Good.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.624
Because our shift
has already begun.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.165
Fucking Ledesma.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.790
CANTINA
"THE BULL RING"

11:31.875 --> 11:34.332
Major, you're out of your mind!

11:34.500 --> 11:37.374
Yeah, but now we have somewhere
to grab a few beers.

11:37.541 --> 11:39.832
- And these won't eat themselves.
- After my shift.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.790
After your shift?
There won't be any left!

11:45.208 --> 11:46.249
What's going on here?

11:46.416 --> 11:48.957
Vital signs monitor,
respirator connected

11:49.125 --> 11:52.749
to the oxygen tank below,
the perfusion pump,

11:52.916 --> 11:54.832
suction apparatus,
intravenous fluids

11:55.000 --> 11:57.999
in those bags, the defibrillator
under that bench...

11:58.458 --> 11:59.665
Abda handles it.

11:59.833 --> 12:04.582
All small material and instruments
always ready in your vest.

12:04.750 --> 12:06.374
Isa, excuse me, can we talk?

12:06.541 --> 12:08.457
Not now, Luis.
I'm with Sanchez.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.207
Any questions?

12:11.375 --> 12:15.124
Yes. When we have to operate,
where do you want me?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.790
Always behind us.

12:16.958 --> 12:18.874
I'm here by the patient's head,

12:19.041 --> 12:21.165
Lieutenant Abda on this side
with the IV

12:21.333 --> 12:23.665
and you pass us materials
from those bags.

12:23.833 --> 12:24.665
Okay?

12:25.375 --> 12:28.332
Always have everything ready
because out here nothing ever happens

12:28.875 --> 12:30.790
until it happens.

12:43.208 --> 12:49.999
SOMEWHERE NORTH OF BALA MURGHAB
17:00 H

12:50.708 --> 12:51.957
<i>Greyhound, this is Falcon.</i>

12:52.291 --> 12:54.374
<i>How do you copy?
Over.</i>

12:54.916 --> 12:56.707
<i>This... Greyhound...</i>

12:56.875 --> 13:00.457
<i>Signal's weak, you're breaking up.
Clean the mike and try again.</i>

13:01.750 --> 13:04.499
<i>Falcon, this is Greyhound.
How do you copy now?</i>

13:05.208 --> 13:07.457
<i>Now it's loud and clear.</i>

13:09.291 --> 13:11.124
<i>Falcon to all units.</i>

13:11.625 --> 13:13.249
<i>Stay on the Husky tracks.</i>

13:13.416 --> 13:16.499
<i>I repeat, nobody leave the tracks.</i>

13:49.833 --> 13:54.832
<i>Falcon to the whole convoy.
IED, prepare for complex attack. Acknowledge.</i>

13:55.000 --> 13:56.165
Greyhound, copy that.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.624
Maño, Hook, Puma, fall out.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.832
<i>All units, station the snipers
on the hills.</i>

14:04.166 --> 14:06.624
Lynx, take a higher position.

14:06.791 --> 14:09.082
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Angulo, that hill.

14:09.291 --> 14:11.790
<i>Snipers, watch out
for booby traps up there.</i>

14:22.791 --> 14:24.207
Peña, are you okay?

14:24.375 --> 14:26.082
I'm okay, sir.
It's nothing.

14:26.250 --> 14:29.540
<i>Falcon to all unit leaders.
Situation report.</i>

14:30.333 --> 14:33.582
<i>Head of the convoy is clear.
No attack over here.</i>

14:35.250 --> 14:36.665
<i>This is Falcon.
Copy that.</i>

14:47.000 --> 14:50.457
POI (POINT OF INCIDENT) 17:15 H

14:50.625 --> 14:52.624
Conte, find a landing zone
for the MEDEVAC.

14:52.791 --> 14:55.957
I'll give you a platoon,
a sniper team and the interpreter.

14:56.416 --> 14:57.624
- Rashid.
- Yes, sir.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.040
Sergeant Aguilar will stay for support
with his platoon.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.374
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

15:02.541 --> 15:06.749
Once they evacuate the wounded,
get your ass out of here.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.999
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

15:09.791 --> 15:10.832
Ready.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.207
No need to tell you
who that is, right?

15:18.541 --> 15:20.415
General Conte's son.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.582
Who was also a lieutenant
at one point.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.749
Give him a hand.

15:56.833 --> 15:59.415
<i>We have two injured
American soldiers.</i>

15:59.625 --> 16:02.499
<i>One seriously with a chest
contusion and difficulty breathing</i>

16:02.708 --> 16:04.790
<i>and another less serious
with facial injuries.</i>

16:05.000 --> 16:08.790
Bruised thorax?
Asymmetrical breathing?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.207
<i>Affirmative.</i>

16:10.500 --> 16:11.874
Sounds like a pneumothorax.

16:12.291 --> 16:15.457
Lie him down
and elevate his head.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.040
<i>Copy that.</i>

16:17.208 --> 16:19.082
<i>More information.
A Spanish soldier</i>

16:19.250 --> 16:21.082
<i>with a rock impact on his helmet
and sand in his eyes.</i>

16:21.250 --> 16:22.374
<i>Doesn't look serious, over.</i>

16:22.583 --> 16:25.665
So he's still conscious.
Dizziness, disorientation?

16:26.291 --> 16:27.290
<i>Negative.</i>

16:28.041 --> 16:29.332
Keep him awake.
I'll pass you

16:29.500 --> 16:31.874
- to the captain.
- What's the terrain like?

16:32.083 --> 16:33.749
<i>Irregular and very dusty.</i>

16:33.958 --> 16:35.790
I need you to secure
a landing zone.

16:35.958 --> 16:37.082
<i>Copy that.</i>

16:37.291 --> 16:40.332
ETA in 9 minutes, over.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.374
Isabel, go to channel 2.

16:43.458 --> 16:44.124
Channel 2.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.874
I had to find out from your sister
that you're going back to Madrid.

16:49.958 --> 16:52.624
That's why I didn't tell you,
so you wouldn't give me shit.

16:52.833 --> 16:53.999
Why do you want to leave?

16:54.416 --> 16:55.665
Give me a break, Luis.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.790
I'll draw you a map later,
I have to prepare the evacuation.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.165
Changing to channel 1.

17:28.165 --> 17:29.374
Ready to land.

17:41.583 --> 17:43.457
Cover the other flank.
Spread out.

17:43.625 --> 17:44.707
I can't see anything, damn it.

17:44.875 --> 17:46.624
Go, go, go!

17:58.958 --> 18:00.999
- Changing to Fast Reduction, Luis.
- Okay.

18:13.125 --> 18:13.707
Hold on, we're tipping!

18:16.250 --> 18:16.832
Hold on!

18:21.291 --> 18:22.749
Watch out for the blades!

18:32.833 --> 18:33.832
Fucking great.

18:36.125 --> 18:36.957
Jesus!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.249
Everybody okay?

18:38.875 --> 18:39.874
Fine.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.999
- Abda?
- Yes, Captain.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.082
- Sanchez?
- Yes, Captain, all good.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.415
Let's go.

19:06.916 --> 19:09.874
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck?

19:10.041 --> 19:11.790
What a shitty landing zone!

19:12.125 --> 19:13.832
It's not so hard, damn it!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.249
We could have all been killed!

19:16.458 --> 19:17.499
Is everyone okay?

19:19.291 --> 19:20.374
Who are you?

19:20.750 --> 19:22.749
At your service, Captain.
Lieutenant Conte.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.082
Come on, move it!

19:36.083 --> 19:37.582
Damn, what a hard landing.

19:38.166 --> 19:39.415
Get all the gear.

19:40.083 --> 19:41.165
Yes, sir.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.707
Is everyone okay?

19:43.458 --> 19:44.665
Where are the wounded?

19:44.833 --> 19:46.207
Over there, Captain.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.665
- Get the gear.
- Let's go!

19:52.666 --> 19:54.040
Excuse me, Captain.

20:02.916 --> 20:05.290
It's a pneumothorax.
Sanchez, the gear.

20:05.458 --> 20:06.790
Here.

20:15.875 --> 20:16.790
Let's lower him.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.124
One, two...

20:24.500 --> 20:25.374
Needle.

20:38.625 --> 20:39.999
Herat, do you copy?

20:41.083 --> 20:42.290
Captain Torres.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.707
What? A rollover?

20:50.791 --> 20:54.124
The American convoy
continued its journey.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.290
The legionnaire escort
went with them

20:56.500 --> 20:59.707
and left five vehicles behind
at the POI.

20:59.958 --> 21:04.582
25 men, the two wounded Americans
and the crew of the crashed MEDEVAC.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.749
Lieutenant Conte is waiting
for orders.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.082
General, the Chinooks are ready
to fly and pick them all up.

21:10.291 --> 21:11.665
When could they leave?

21:11.833 --> 21:13.415
In 20 minutes, General.

21:13.583 --> 21:15.624
Inform Conte that we're on our way.

21:18.125 --> 21:19.040
General.

21:19.208 --> 21:20.082
Yes?

21:20.333 --> 21:23.790
If we bring back the helicopter on the
same mission, we won't have to return.

21:24.208 --> 21:25.874
You want to bring back
the helicopter?

21:26.041 --> 21:27.915
We can't leave it there...

21:28.083 --> 21:29.874
Ledesma, we'll blow up
the MEDEVAC.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.832
Just evacuate the crew
and the wounded Americans.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.124
Colonel, if the helicopter only tipped over,
it can be recovered for service.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.415
It can still save many lives.

21:40.791 --> 21:43.249
The Super Puma is at the limit
of what a Chinook can carry.

21:43.416 --> 21:45.499
Yeah, 7,900 kilos.
But it's lost its blades,

21:45.708 --> 21:47.457
which is 250 kilos less.

21:47.708 --> 21:50.415
I'm sure Captain Torres
can take off the rest.

21:53.666 --> 21:55.374
They'd have to spend the night there.

21:56.041 --> 21:56.832
General,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.707
we'd be turning a routine
rescue mission

21:59.875 --> 22:02.415
into a complex operation
with no guarantee of success.

22:04.916 --> 22:06.082
The problem is the photo.

22:08.541 --> 22:09.499
The photo.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.832
If we leave the helicopter there,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.457
blown up or not,

22:13.625 --> 22:15.957
the bad guys will take
a photo with it.

22:16.125 --> 22:19.124
And it fucking pisses me off,
if you'll excuse my language.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.999
But if we bring it back,

22:23.708 --> 22:26.999
we can turn this accident
into a victory.

22:35.041 --> 22:37.290
Put me through to the doctor
at the POI.

22:37.458 --> 22:38.499
Isabel!

22:39.166 --> 22:40.165
Herat!

22:44.541 --> 22:46.207
Yes? This is Doctor Varela.

22:46.375 --> 22:47.915
At your service, Colonel.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.290
We're considering
recovering the MEDEVAC

22:50.458 --> 22:54.415
<i>but before we decide we need to know
if the wounded can stay there overnight.</i>

22:54.583 --> 22:57.999
They're stable but we should
evacuate them as soon as possible.

22:58.166 --> 23:01.040
<i>That doesn't answer my question.
Yes or no, Varela?</i>

23:03.791 --> 23:05.207
Yes, they can, Colonel.

23:06.875 --> 23:08.332
Thank you, Varela.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.374
Colonel, can I talk to her?

23:13.583 --> 23:15.707
Varela, what's up?
Put Torres on.

23:15.875 --> 23:18.790
But tell him I'm the colonel.
Tell him, damn it.

23:20.958 --> 23:22.165
The colonel.

23:24.875 --> 23:25.624
Colonel?

23:26.083 --> 23:28.624
What's up, Luisito?
Did you forget how to park or what?

23:28.833 --> 23:31.540
<i>If you took your eyes
off Varela's tits...</i>

23:31.708 --> 23:34.165
Stop talking about tits,
this is serious.

23:34.666 --> 23:35.957
Are you getting us out of here
or what?

23:36.166 --> 23:38.665
<i>Now that you ruined my dinner,
I have to find something to do.</i>

23:38.833 --> 23:41.290
Listen, I need you to do
something for me.

23:41.666 --> 23:43.082
Anything you want.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.915
<i>You have to pluck your bird's
feathers.</i>

23:45.083 --> 23:47.207
It has to weigh 1,500 kilos less.

23:49.541 --> 23:52.249
You convinced them we can do it
without tools, what a bastard.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.999
Seriously, don't make me look bad.

23:56.166 --> 23:58.332
<i>- Pluck as much as you can.</i>
- We'll get right on it.

23:58.666 --> 24:00.749
Have a good night.
I'll see you in the morning.

24:00.916 --> 24:02.457
We'll be waiting.

24:03.333 --> 24:04.207
What's up, Vilches?

24:04.375 --> 24:06.499
- How's your leg, Captain?
- Much better.

24:06.666 --> 24:08.624
You were quick
disengaging the rotor.

24:08.791 --> 24:12.040
The engines, electrical and
hydraulic equipment are all fine.

24:12.541 --> 24:14.290
It's a bitch to have to blow her up.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.832
How can we reduce her weight
by a ton and a half?

24:17.375 --> 24:18.499
What are you talking about?

24:18.666 --> 24:19.790
She's coming with us.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.665
Awesome. We'll remove
the weapons support, the blades...

24:22.916 --> 24:24.999
And the armor plate weighs
at least 300 kilos.

24:25.166 --> 24:27.665
And the gasoline,
which must weigh a ton.

24:27.833 --> 24:28.749
It'll take a while.

24:28.916 --> 24:30.874
So the sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

24:31.041 --> 24:31.374
Yes, sir.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.290
You're not going anywhere
until I see that leg.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.290
- Not now, when we finish.
- Yes, now.

24:39.166 --> 24:41.707
"Yes, now." You're just as stubborn
as your sister.

24:41.916 --> 24:42.707
Come on.

24:42.875 --> 24:46.207
- Set up a tent for the wounded.
- Yes, sir.

24:46.416 --> 24:48.040
- Maño.
- Yes, sir.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.457
I want your vehicle
on this hillside,

24:50.625 --> 24:53.332
covering the area from this rock
to over here, got it?

24:53.500 --> 24:54.457
Yes, sir.

24:54.625 --> 24:56.415
- The RG. Hook, where are you?
- Here, sir.

24:56.583 --> 24:59.207
Parapet the exposed flank
from the wounded nest.

24:59.416 --> 24:59.874
Yes, sir.

25:00.041 --> 25:03.874
The rest of us will use that slope
as a trench to defend the south area.

25:05.083 --> 25:06.707
And, of course, the helicopter.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.207
Lieutenant.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.249
What is it?

25:10.416 --> 25:11.749
The heights behind us worry me.

25:11.916 --> 25:14.832
Why don't we park the vehicles
against the slope for cover?

25:19.083 --> 25:22.082
The snipers already have
those heights covered.

25:23.208 --> 25:24.499
How are we on food and ammo?

25:24.666 --> 25:26.957
Ammo? Barely enough.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.832
The Americans left some food
and water for one day.

25:31.208 --> 25:33.249
- Got it. Any questions?
- None.

25:33.416 --> 25:35.374
Anything? Questions? Anything?

25:36.083 --> 25:37.040
More questions?

25:39.041 --> 25:40.832
Gentlemen, get to work.

25:46.291 --> 25:48.540
Let's raise the tent.
One, two and three.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.540
And when I went to give her back
her pashmina,

25:58.750 --> 26:01.915
she dropped and covered her head
like she'd just seen the devil.

26:04.375 --> 26:06.290
That's probably because
she found you ugly as fuck.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.499
Movement at 10 o'clock.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.040
About 300 meters.

26:17.791 --> 26:18.999
It's a fox.

26:19.791 --> 26:20.749
Fucking awesome.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.790
<i>Lynx, this is Bull.</i>

26:22.958 --> 26:25.374
<i>We're reorganizing the perimeter
to spend the night.</i>

26:25.666 --> 26:27.040
Wait for instructions.

26:27.375 --> 26:28.415
<i>Copy that, Bull.</i>

26:35.458 --> 26:39.207
Lynx to Bull. If we're staying,
can Peña come up and support us?

26:39.375 --> 26:41.665
<i>Our backs are getting
a little cold.</i>

26:42.958 --> 26:43.749
Negative.

26:43.916 --> 26:46.415
<i>Peña's out of danger,
but his eyes are hurt.</i>

26:46.583 --> 26:48.790
<i>We'll send someone right up.
Over.</i>

26:49.375 --> 26:50.124
Copy that.

26:54.375 --> 26:56.540
Thanks, Isa. I know the helicopter
coming with us

26:56.708 --> 26:58.290
is thanks to you.

26:58.458 --> 27:01.665
Don't thank me.
I wanted to evacuate the wounded.

27:01.833 --> 27:04.540
Besides, it's better this way.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.415
We only have one MEDEVAC left.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.957
Without medical rescue,
there's no reason for us to be here.

27:11.333 --> 27:12.707
No reason for you, apparently.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.582
I've been offered a job

27:19.333 --> 27:22.290
as head of the Emergency Room
at Clínico Hospital in Madrid.

27:22.458 --> 27:23.457
It's a great offer.

27:23.916 --> 27:25.499
Like Sabina says,

27:27.125 --> 27:30.332
you'll feel like a bullfighter
behind the Iron Curtain.

27:30.666 --> 27:33.124
You're a military doctor, damn it.
You'll get bored there.

27:33.666 --> 27:35.457
Yeah, because this is so much fun.

27:37.166 --> 27:38.707
You mean the kid
the other day, right?

27:44.791 --> 27:46.415
I'm leaving, that's it.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.207
Puma, your vehicle is sticking out.
I want it in helmet defilade right now!

28:47.208 --> 28:48.999
<i>Greyhound, this is Lynx.</i>

28:50.500 --> 28:51.415
This is Greyhound.

28:51.583 --> 28:55.999
<i>A man, 300 meters south south-east
of your position. We'll keep watching.</i>

28:59.125 --> 29:00.165
Copy that.

29:00.791 --> 29:03.415
Greyhound to the whole squad.
Everyone stay alert.

29:24.166 --> 29:25.374
Looks like a shepherd.

29:25.666 --> 29:28.874
Yeah, they're all shepherds.

29:39.416 --> 29:40.415
Lynx, this is Greyhound.

29:40.750 --> 29:41.957
<i>Can you see if he's armed?</i>

29:42.125 --> 29:44.165
I don't see any weapons.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.457
Negative.

29:45.875 --> 29:47.624
<i>Should we fire a warning shot?</i>

29:48.541 --> 29:51.082
Negative, we'll follow
the rules of engagement.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.040
Maño, Hook, watch your sectors,
damn it!

30:17.875 --> 30:22.332
Lieutenant, by now he even knows
the size of our underwear.

30:27.625 --> 30:28.707
This is Lieutenant Conte.

30:29.208 --> 30:33.790
Unarmed non-combatant observing
our camp at 200 meters from our position.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.082
Request satellite tracking.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.665
Look, Lieutenant.
If he leaves, we're sold out.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.624
Rules of engagement.

30:42.791 --> 30:45.374
I need fucking confirmation
that he's hostile.

30:45.916 --> 30:47.332
Fucking rules.

30:49.708 --> 30:52.290
Whoever made them has never
been to Afghanistan.

30:53.166 --> 30:55.749
If he had he'd know
that all tucus look the same.

30:57.083 --> 30:58.832
The same turban,

30:59.666 --> 31:01.582
the same vest,

31:02.166 --> 31:03.874
the same Kalashnikov...

31:07.916 --> 31:10.624
Greyhound, this is Lynx.
He's only a kid.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.707
If he leaves, we're sold.

31:13.875 --> 31:16.499
Give the order, Lieutenant.
Make my day.

31:18.166 --> 31:18.790
Rashid!

31:18.958 --> 31:20.290
Come back here!

31:20.916 --> 31:22.582
Damn tucu!
Rashid, come back here!

31:42.166 --> 31:43.874
Son of a bitch!

32:00.791 --> 32:03.874
Greyhound, this is Lynx. I have a shot,
but he's about to disappear

32:04.041 --> 32:07.582
behind the hill.
Last chance, Lieutenant.

32:10.833 --> 32:11.707
No.

32:14.375 --> 32:15.957
Greyhound, this is Lynx.
I've lost him.

32:16.125 --> 32:17.790
I repeat, I've lost him.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.665
Are you crazy or what?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.707
What the fuck
were you two saying?

32:43.333 --> 32:45.874
Take it easy.
He's a boy. It's okay.

32:46.166 --> 32:47.790
He says he lives
in a village nearby.

32:47.958 --> 32:49.915
He heard the explosion
and came to see what it was.

32:50.083 --> 32:51.999
After all the time you spoke?
Don't lie to me, you bastard!

32:52.166 --> 32:52.582
Aguilar!

33:00.875 --> 33:01.874
We've got him.

33:10.166 --> 33:11.374
What's he doing?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.415
Copy that.

33:27.125 --> 33:28.165
Fuck!

33:29.291 --> 33:31.207
Shepherd my ass!

33:31.375 --> 33:32.624
Sergeant!

33:36.458 --> 33:39.165
Alert everyone that the insurgency
knows our position.

33:39.625 --> 33:40.915
Yes, sir.

33:55.416 --> 33:56.415
God!

34:06.416 --> 34:08.790
Castro, Rodriguez!
With me!

34:10.875 --> 34:12.498
Check the hook.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.581
Okay, everyone.

34:17.791 --> 34:20.831
We're going to calculate
for 20% overweight.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.081
Why the long faces?

34:26.708 --> 34:27.998
What are you worried about?

34:28.416 --> 34:29.873
The cables, sir.

34:30.083 --> 34:33.748
We can tie one end at the head
of the rotor to sustain the weight

34:33.958 --> 34:37.623
and another from the back hook
to the tail to keep it from swinging.

34:37.916 --> 34:40.123
We don't know what state
the tail is in.

34:40.416 --> 34:42.748
I think it's better to avoid it
so it won't bend

34:42.916 --> 34:44.665
and focus on the head of the rotor.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.790
If we lift from only one point,

34:47.958 --> 34:49.331
it's going to swing like crazy.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.581
Especially if it's windy.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.290
Yeah, that area is a bitch.

34:53.375 --> 34:54.248
No.

34:54.833 --> 34:56.540
We have to do it with two hooks.

34:57.875 --> 34:59.040
Let's see.

35:00.708 --> 35:03.665
We hitch to the head of the rotor,
so the helicopter won't bend.

35:03.833 --> 35:06.290
Then, one cable goes to the back hook

35:06.458 --> 35:08.415
and another to the front hook.
That's it.

35:08.791 --> 35:10.874
- How's the performance data table?
- It's coming.

35:12.916 --> 35:15.832
- Can I bring you some coffee or anything?
- Sorry, sir.

35:18.541 --> 35:20.249
Give me a hand.

35:20.416 --> 35:22.915
- Careful.
- Come on, grab it.

35:23.375 --> 35:24.082
Careful.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.582
Be careful.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.207
Captain.

35:30.625 --> 35:31.832
Are you almost finished?

35:32.208 --> 35:34.582
Even working all night
won't be enough.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.999
You're making too much noise,
Captain.

35:37.166 --> 35:38.999
We'll try to be more quiet.

35:39.250 --> 35:41.207
When night falls, there can't be
any light on the perimeter.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.374
I know, I know.

35:42.791 --> 35:45.040
I'm also going to need
one of your gunners.

35:45.250 --> 35:46.915
Take Sobrino, she's very good.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.124
Sobrino!

35:49.916 --> 35:51.124
Yes, sir?

35:51.291 --> 35:53.165
You're under the lieutenant's command.

35:53.375 --> 35:54.665
No problem, sir.

35:54.916 --> 35:56.040
Lieutenant.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.124
The accident wasn't your fault.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.040
I'm the pilot, I'm responsible.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.374
Yes, I know, Captain.

36:04.250 --> 36:05.290
Conte.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.540
When a superior apologizes,
accept his apology. All right?

36:14.083 --> 36:15.249
Yes, sir.

36:20.750 --> 36:21.749
Lynx, this is Greyhound.

36:21.916 --> 36:23.790
<i>I'm sending you
the Super Puma's gunner.</i>

36:23.958 --> 36:25.499
You're fucking kidding.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.915
Sir, with all due respect,

36:30.083 --> 36:32.915
<i>Maño can do it. He knows how
we do things in the Legion.</i>

36:33.125 --> 36:34.624
Negative, she'll do it.

36:36.000 --> 36:36.999
Sobrino.

36:37.666 --> 36:40.749
Climb the hill and report
to Corporal Carranza.

36:40.916 --> 36:42.040
Yes, sir.

36:44.666 --> 36:47.165
Don't blow her head off
on her way up.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.332
Damn. He's sending up
a girl grunt.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.957
Well, if she's hot...

37:11.166 --> 37:12.749
- Here she is.
- Yeah.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.707
Private First Class Sobrino
reporting for duty, sir.

37:18.208 --> 37:19.499
Okay. This is Angulo.

37:19.666 --> 37:23.040
Climb up there and protect our backs
with that machine. Let me see.

37:24.708 --> 37:27.374
Not bad, to defend the helicopter.
Tracer bullets, right?

37:27.541 --> 37:28.499
Yeah, that's right.

37:28.666 --> 37:31.207
It'll give away our position.
So only fire as a last resort.

37:31.541 --> 37:32.540
Yes, sir.

37:33.166 --> 37:34.165
Sir.

37:35.208 --> 37:36.957
How are things done in the Legion?

37:40.083 --> 37:40.999
Right.

37:52.958 --> 37:54.582
Yeah, she's hot.

37:57.791 --> 37:59.040
Go to infrared.

37:59.208 --> 38:00.665
Yes, sir.

38:03.583 --> 38:05.582
They don't have night vision.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.624
If they attack,
they'll wait until sunrise.

38:11.375 --> 38:14.207
Yes, but our men are in for
a long night.

38:14.583 --> 38:17.332
- So you bought it?
- Sure, I'm the best uncle in the world.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.165
How many kilos
have we taken off?

38:19.708 --> 38:21.832
600 and something,
we're not at 700 yet.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.165
Good lord.
Okay, let's get to it.

38:35.208 --> 38:36.999
- Lights?
- Lights out.

38:53.125 --> 38:54.249
Head...

38:54.541 --> 38:56.540
- Pain...
- Let me see.

38:57.666 --> 38:59.915
- You speak Spanish?
- A little.

39:00.708 --> 39:02.165
Paella...
One beer, please...

39:08.375 --> 39:10.457
These foreigners waste no time.

39:11.833 --> 39:14.249
Hey, beautiful.
You want to get down?

39:15.625 --> 39:17.040
Well, Sanchez?

39:18.833 --> 39:20.415
I think...

39:21.083 --> 39:23.624
you're more handsome
when you're quiet.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.290
Have you got a boyfriend...

39:29.250 --> 39:29.957
No.

39:31.750 --> 39:32.707
You just blew it.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.040
You're too green, Sanchez.
He'll be all over you now.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.540
All over and under,
with all due respect.

39:42.708 --> 39:45.874
- Did you bring the perfusion pump?
- I forgot.

39:46.041 --> 39:46.832
Okay, I'll get it.

39:51.416 --> 39:52.499
Sanchez, the light!

39:57.500 --> 39:59.707
Sorry, Captain.
I didn't realize.

40:00.291 --> 40:01.332
Lights!

40:02.708 --> 40:03.540
Lights out!

40:07.166 --> 40:09.415
What the fuck were you thinking,
Private?

40:09.583 --> 40:10.374
Sorry, Lieutenant...

40:10.541 --> 40:12.665
You think we're fucking
camping here?

40:13.333 --> 40:14.749
That's enough, Lieutenant.

40:15.375 --> 40:17.540
- It's her first mission here.
- I don't care, Captain.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.624
You need to know
you've come to a war.

40:21.041 --> 40:22.207
This is hostile ground.

40:22.416 --> 40:24.957
- Nothing happened.
- But it will, Captain.

40:25.125 --> 40:26.207
It will.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.124
I'm here to watch over
every single one of you.

40:30.541 --> 40:32.165
Including your precious
helicopter.

40:33.833 --> 40:37.374
My precious helicopter
has saved hundreds of lives.

40:37.541 --> 40:40.332
You know what the Afghans
call my precious helicopter?

40:41.041 --> 40:42.999
The Sound of Life.

40:44.708 --> 40:47.332
With all due respect
and subordination, Captain,

40:47.750 --> 40:48.707
this is a war.

40:48.875 --> 40:51.207
We're not an NGO,
we're soldiers.

40:52.125 --> 40:52.749
Sanchez,

40:52.916 --> 40:55.374
- act like one.
- Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

40:56.750 --> 40:57.624
Captain.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.290
Lights!

41:08.041 --> 41:09.999
With all due respect, Captain,

41:10.208 --> 41:11.540
the lieutenant has a stick
up his ass.

41:11.708 --> 41:13.624
Yes, but he's right, Abda.

41:14.583 --> 41:16.207
A tiny mistake and people die.

41:16.375 --> 41:18.540
And those are the ones
we always remember,

41:18.708 --> 41:20.207
not the ones we save.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.957
Be more careful, Private.

41:22.291 --> 41:24.874
- No more mistakes.
- No.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.457
Come on, gentlemen,
we're in deep shit.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.457
Francis, go ahead and start yours up.

41:36.708 --> 41:38.957
Alvite, call the tower
and request a slot to take off.

41:39.125 --> 41:41.290
- Weren't we leaving in the morning?
- Change of plans, we're leaving now.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.374
Where? Sir, where?

41:44.916 --> 41:47.040
Why do you want to fly
to Bala Murghab already?

41:47.208 --> 41:49.457
To be closer to the POI
at dawn.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.165
So we can go in as soon as
a window opens.

41:56.458 --> 41:59.082
<i>- Torques 100% joined.
- Check.</i>

41:59.250 --> 42:01.332
Transmission instruments
and engines green.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.082
Green.

42:02.291 --> 42:03.915
ACS locked on.

42:04.208 --> 42:05.457
Ready for take off.

42:05.625 --> 42:07.040
<i>We're ready back here.</i>

42:13.458 --> 42:14.249
Okay.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.332
- Mine.
- Yours.

42:16.750 --> 42:19.540
Take off in 5, 4, 3...

42:20.041 --> 42:21.499
<i>2, 1...</i>

42:21.750 --> 42:23.290
<i>Taking off.</i>

42:42.916 --> 42:46.582
1,200 meters to rocks by trail.

42:48.250 --> 42:50.124
So the bitch dumps him on Skype.

42:51.458 --> 42:53.915
Peña's really on a shit streak.

42:55.416 --> 42:58.665
950 meters to top of hill.

43:00.083 --> 43:01.582
She's super hot.

43:01.833 --> 43:04.332
If she's not with him,
I can bang her.

43:04.500 --> 43:06.499
Damn, Angulo, you're sick.

43:12.708 --> 43:15.499
Sir, I haven't seen the fox
in a while.

44:02.625 --> 44:03.749
Lynx, this is Greyhound.

44:04.083 --> 44:05.499
<i>You see the motorcycle?</i>

44:09.083 --> 44:10.249
Negative.

44:11.083 --> 44:11.915
No targets in sight.

44:14.791 --> 44:17.915
Come on, you bastards.
Show yourselves.

44:21.041 --> 44:22.290
Greyhound, this is Lynx.

44:22.791 --> 44:24.999
<i>I've got it.
Ready to fire.</i>

44:27.583 --> 44:29.540
<i>See any weapons
or hostile movement?</i>

44:29.875 --> 44:30.707
Negative.

44:31.166 --> 44:32.624
No weapons in sight.

44:33.250 --> 44:34.415
Wait, Greyhound.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.082
He's leaving.

44:48.875 --> 44:50.540
- This is Lieutenant Conte.
<i>- Conte.</i>

44:50.791 --> 44:53.332
4 SUVs and 3 motorcycles
are approaching your position

44:53.500 --> 44:55.207
from peak 405.

44:55.416 --> 44:56.832
I'll keep you posted.

44:57.083 --> 44:59.582
- How many?
- 47, sir.

45:00.625 --> 45:01.832
You hear that, Conte?

45:02.041 --> 45:03.290
47 insurgents in all.

45:03.458 --> 45:06.790
<i>For X-ray, 32570.</i>

45:07.416 --> 45:10.374
For Yankee, 69541.

45:10.625 --> 45:11.582
<i>Copy that.</i>

45:11.750 --> 45:15.040
Greyhound here. Everyone
on alert for possible attack.

45:17.333 --> 45:21.165
Don't move or speak
or even breathe.

45:21.666 --> 45:22.665
Do you copy?

45:39.833 --> 45:41.790
Damn!
She's going to crack our heads open.

45:41.958 --> 45:42.999
What's up?

45:51.125 --> 45:51.707
Goats.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.165
A herd without a shepherd
to the north.

46:00.041 --> 46:01.249
Shit.

46:02.166 --> 46:03.749
Greyhound, this is Lynx.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.790
Herd without a shepherd
362 meters north of our position.

46:07.958 --> 46:09.540
- We'll keep watch.
<i>- Copy that, Lynx.</i>

46:14.375 --> 46:17.040
Tell Sobrino to keep her head down.

46:17.208 --> 46:19.332
Not a single fucking shot until
they show their faces.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.540
We can't give away
our position.

46:31.750 --> 46:32.749
Damn it.

46:39.875 --> 46:41.707
Greyhound, this is Lynx.
Reporting.

46:41.916 --> 46:44.374
Motorcycle approaching
your position from the west.

46:44.791 --> 46:46.832
Copy that. We hear them
but we can't see them.

46:53.791 --> 46:54.707
There are two more.

46:55.208 --> 46:57.665
They're approaching in parallel
along the trail.

47:00.500 --> 47:01.540
Greyhound, Lynx here.

47:01.708 --> 47:04.707
<i>They've stopped 370 meters away
from your position.</i>

47:16.041 --> 47:17.415
What the fuck?

47:17.708 --> 47:19.415
They're raising dust.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.249
To hide the attack.

47:23.875 --> 47:24.707
Aguilar!

47:24.875 --> 47:26.582
Jump those rocks
to take their flank.

47:26.750 --> 47:28.374
Yes, sir.
Vazquez, with me.

47:28.541 --> 47:29.582
Yes, sir!

47:41.458 --> 47:42.582
Vazquez!

47:42.833 --> 47:43.624
Take cover!

47:46.083 --> 47:47.874
Return fire! Return fire!

47:48.041 --> 47:48.499
Medic!

47:50.583 --> 47:51.499
Medic!

47:53.791 --> 47:55.040
Suppressive fire on the ridge!

47:58.083 --> 47:59.665
Jaramillo, blast those bastards!

48:02.083 --> 48:03.165
Fuck!

48:04.208 --> 48:06.249
Lynx! Turn off that light!

48:24.500 --> 48:26.832
This is Lynx!
We're taking suppressive fire!

48:27.000 --> 48:27.874
We're pinned down!

48:28.041 --> 48:29.332
<i>Can't offer support!</i>

48:29.500 --> 48:30.165
Goddamn it!

48:31.791 --> 48:32.790
Lights.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.707
We have to go after them!

48:40.875 --> 48:42.707
We have to get them
out of the light!

48:43.041 --> 48:44.874
- Vazquez!
- They're using them as bait!

48:45.666 --> 48:47.249
Don't go near the light!

48:47.750 --> 48:48.915
Eliminate the threat first!

48:49.458 --> 48:50.749
Where are you going, Angulo?

48:51.666 --> 48:52.374
I've got them!

48:52.541 --> 48:54.790
15 meters to the right
of peak 804.

48:54.958 --> 48:56.124
- Across the valley!
- Get down!

48:59.416 --> 49:00.207
Shit!

49:02.166 --> 49:04.290
Greyhound, Angulo's wounded!

49:04.458 --> 49:06.124
<i>- Angulo's wounded!</i>
- Damn it!

49:06.333 --> 49:07.915
Fire, return fire!

49:08.083 --> 49:09.665
Concentrate your fire!

49:12.375 --> 49:13.374
Cover him!

49:17.875 --> 49:20.457
Touch it and I'll blow your head off,
you bastard!

49:20.625 --> 49:21.790
Fuck you!

49:25.208 --> 49:25.624
Help me!

49:29.833 --> 49:31.540
Lynx, the fucking lights!

49:38.000 --> 49:39.165
Now, sir!

49:45.583 --> 49:46.915
Take cover!

50:10.541 --> 50:11.749
Captain, get down!

50:15.875 --> 50:16.915
Shit.

50:17.208 --> 50:18.124
Bastard.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.707
Greyhound, this is Lynx.
Enemy snipers withdrawing.

50:33.041 --> 50:34.999
I took out a motorcycle
but the other one got away.

50:35.166 --> 50:35.915
I'm okay.

50:36.250 --> 50:38.999
They shot me in the ass!
Damn it.

50:39.166 --> 50:42.374
A little closer and you'd have
to bang Peña's girlfriend yourself!

50:44.583 --> 50:45.957
Quickly!

50:47.833 --> 50:50.999
This is Greyhound. Extreme precaution.
I don't want any more wounded.

50:51.166 --> 50:53.790
- Aguilar, are you okay?
- Yes, Lieutenant. How's Vazquez?

50:55.500 --> 50:57.749
Bullet wound with entry
in the shoulder blade.

50:58.125 --> 51:00.499
It punctured the lung.
We have to intubate him. Abda!

51:00.666 --> 51:02.582
The oxygen tank
is in the MEDEVAC.

51:02.750 --> 51:04.540
We'll take him there. Sanchez,
laryngoscope and tube.

51:04.708 --> 51:06.249
- Right away.
- Come on, pick him up.

51:06.416 --> 51:08.249
Hold the perimeter!

51:09.291 --> 51:10.249
Lynx, this is Greyhound.

51:10.416 --> 51:11.832
<i>How's Angulo?</i>

51:12.000 --> 51:13.707
He's okay. It's just a flesh wound.

51:13.875 --> 51:16.332
<i>Copy that. Come down.
Do you need help?</i>

51:16.833 --> 51:17.832
Negative.

51:18.041 --> 51:20.124
- Sobrino and I can handle it.
- Damn.

51:20.416 --> 51:22.790
My first time getting shot.
It's nice and warm.

51:22.958 --> 51:24.124
Like I peed myself.

51:24.375 --> 51:26.332
Abda, help the sergeant first.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.999
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant! The stretcher. Help.

51:29.166 --> 51:30.040
Yes, sir!

51:30.208 --> 51:31.874
Gavilan, bring two men over here!

51:32.708 --> 51:33.332
On three.

51:33.791 --> 51:35.665
One, two, three.

51:35.833 --> 51:38.915
Take care of Vazquez, sir.
I'll handle this.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.290
Squeeze tight.

51:42.125 --> 51:43.124
Here you go.

51:59.166 --> 52:00.999
Who do you think you are?

52:03.041 --> 52:03.790
So...

52:04.041 --> 52:06.790
The cops you trained
started shooting at you.

52:07.041 --> 52:08.082
What a shame.

52:08.708 --> 52:11.124
But I'm not like them,
you understand?

52:14.958 --> 52:17.665
The Taliban killed my whole family

52:17.833 --> 52:20.249
for taking me and my sisters
to Barcelona.

52:20.625 --> 52:22.207
I do have a reason to be here,

52:22.375 --> 52:23.707
more than you.

52:24.916 --> 52:26.915
I'm not like them!

52:48.333 --> 52:49.874
BALA MURGHAB
COMBAT OUTPOST (COP)

52:50.041 --> 52:52.207
Landing zone in sight,
permission to land.

53:06.500 --> 53:09.207
- Anything you need, sir.
- Captain, if I may...

53:09.375 --> 53:10.415
Come in.

53:13.416 --> 53:15.540
Excuse me, Major.
Captain Lazaro.

53:15.708 --> 53:17.832
- What's up?
- Bad news from the area.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.457
- What happened?
- There was an attack.

53:19.625 --> 53:22.999
The insurgents are concentrated
in the rearguard at this height.

53:23.166 --> 53:25.665
Our people are here,
trapped in this hollow.

53:25.833 --> 53:26.915
In this area.

53:27.208 --> 53:28.499
You said we're here, right?

53:28.958 --> 53:29.832
Yes, sir.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.207
Look closely.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.957
This is like a giant bowl
full of dust,

53:33.125 --> 53:35.332
it's where they make it,
that's our main problem.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.749
But we can fly in and position
ourselves on top of the cargo

53:37.916 --> 53:39.207
before all the dust covers it.

53:39.375 --> 53:40.874
Yes, but how do we stay in position?

53:41.041 --> 53:42.707
If we can't see the cargo,
we'll drift.

53:43.041 --> 53:45.957
We can put two vehicles
in the distance as a reference.

53:46.125 --> 53:47.582
If we focus on them,

53:47.750 --> 53:50.874
we can tell if we're drifting.
Then it's a question of skill.

53:51.416 --> 53:53.624
Skill? Then someone else
should do it.

53:54.416 --> 53:56.207
No, seriously.
It's a good idea.

53:56.375 --> 53:58.207
Between the two of us
we can pull it off.

53:58.375 --> 53:59.540
What do you say, Castro?

53:59.708 --> 54:01.790
- In theory, yes, we can.
- Nacho?

54:02.166 --> 54:03.540
I think so, sir.

54:04.291 --> 54:05.124
Good.

54:05.541 --> 54:07.457
- Get the gunners ready.
- I'll handle it.

54:07.791 --> 54:09.290
We'll eat and drink
in the Chinook.

54:09.916 --> 54:11.374
- Get to work.
- Yes, sir.

54:11.583 --> 54:15.499
Lazaro, I need plenty of ammo
for the vehicles. Food, water...

54:15.750 --> 54:17.874
- As much as you can give me.
- Anything you need, sir.

54:24.458 --> 54:26.457
Here, for the gunners.

54:27.083 --> 54:29.582
<i>Conte, I'll bring you up to date
on the new situation.</i>

54:29.750 --> 54:32.749
<i>Activity in the area
has picked up. We've identified</i>

54:32.916 --> 54:36.999
two pick-ups, three SUVs
and a large number of motorcycles.

54:37.166 --> 54:37.707
We think

54:37.875 --> 54:40.457
<i>they're preparing an attack
at dawn. I'll keep you posted</i>

54:40.625 --> 54:41.665
on their movements.

54:41.875 --> 54:43.332
Give me a count
of how many come in.

54:43.500 --> 54:45.707
The border is 350 kilometers
from the POI.

54:46.041 --> 54:49.540
How long have the Tigers
been out? Before they run out

54:49.708 --> 54:51.915
of fuel, pull them back
and send them over.

54:52.125 --> 54:54.665
Two groups of 6 men
at the top of the trail.

54:54.833 --> 54:55.915
Captain, they keep coming.

54:56.250 --> 54:59.082
<i>You have about 200 insurgents
in the area.</i>

54:59.458 --> 55:02.874
<i>Another truck in transit 4 kilometers
from the enemy position.</i>

55:03.041 --> 55:04.582
There will be more at dawn.

55:06.875 --> 55:08.499
Conte, this is Colonel Bermudez.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.874
If the position becomes
indefensible,

55:11.041 --> 55:13.957
you're authorized to blow up the MEDEVAC
and evacuate in the vehicles.

55:14.125 --> 55:15.874
Yes, sir.

55:30.708 --> 55:31.874
Captain.

55:39.250 --> 55:41.040
Captain, have you got a second?

55:41.458 --> 55:42.124
Yes.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.624
How is Vazquez?

55:55.708 --> 55:57.082
Stable.

55:57.708 --> 56:00.707
I wish I could say out of danger,
but it's still too soon.

56:00.916 --> 56:03.457
Could the wounded be moved
into in the vehicles?

56:04.666 --> 56:05.915
- Yes.
- Do it.

56:06.083 --> 56:08.249
And the MEDEVAC crew
as well.

56:11.750 --> 56:13.415
Don't worry, we're not going
anywhere.

56:15.041 --> 56:18.249
We control this location.
Not what's out there...

56:19.416 --> 56:21.582
Inside the vehicles you'll be safe
from gunfire.

56:22.166 --> 56:23.915
Next time start there.

56:24.916 --> 56:25.957
Next time.

56:26.750 --> 56:27.999
Captain.

56:31.916 --> 56:33.457
- Aguilar.
- Lieutenant.

56:33.750 --> 56:36.249
Remember what you said
about the vehicles against the slope?

56:36.458 --> 56:37.124
Yes.

56:37.875 --> 56:38.874
Do it.

56:39.750 --> 56:40.832
Yes, sir.

56:42.250 --> 56:44.999
The Americans can't send us
any Apaches. What about the Tigers?

56:45.166 --> 56:46.207
Almost empty.

56:46.375 --> 56:48.665
If we send them to the COP
for fuel and ammo,

56:48.875 --> 56:50.290
how long would that
set them back?

56:50.500 --> 56:52.249
40, 45 minutes.

56:52.416 --> 56:53.582
That's too long.

56:53.875 --> 56:57.207
The insurgents don't know
that we're almost out of ammo.

56:58.875 --> 57:00.749
Send two Tigers to the POI.

57:01.416 --> 57:04.582
If we're lucky, the insurgents
will fall for the bluff and flee.

57:04.833 --> 57:06.957
And send the other Tiger to refuel.

57:07.791 --> 57:10.832
Let's give Ledesma a chance
to go in and get them.

57:14.291 --> 57:15.832
Lower him carefully.

57:19.291 --> 57:21.499
Come on, Norris.
Up you go.

57:32.250 --> 57:33.415
Luis, Luis.

57:34.708 --> 57:35.999
Pick it up, pick it up!

57:40.708 --> 57:41.749
<i>Luisito.</i>

57:42.458 --> 57:44.624
It's great to hear your voice, sir.

57:44.791 --> 57:46.457
<i>Isabel, what did you do
to my friend?</i>

57:50.958 --> 57:55.249
We removed around 650 kilos
before the attack.

57:55.708 --> 57:57.665
I don't think we can
take off much more.

57:57.833 --> 57:58.540
Bullet in the ass!

57:59.250 --> 58:00.457
What's up? Yeah.

58:02.625 --> 58:03.624
Can he lie face down?

58:04.166 --> 58:05.249
Yeah.

58:05.583 --> 58:06.874
Yeah, I can hear you, Ramon.

58:07.041 --> 58:08.124
Go ahead.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.665
I'll tell Vilches.

58:10.166 --> 58:10.915
Yeah.

58:11.291 --> 58:12.665
Sure, sure.

58:13.333 --> 58:15.665
My anti-bullet charm must be
broken, Captain.

58:15.833 --> 58:17.707
Don't worry, this one
won't kill you.

58:17.875 --> 58:18.499
LUIS@Ok.

58:18.666 --> 58:20.540
I can't leave you guys alone
for a second.

58:20.708 --> 58:23.457
Watch and learn, Peña. She took out
4 tucus all by herself.

58:23.666 --> 58:24.874
Want to join the Legion?

58:26.041 --> 58:27.082
Negative.

58:29.375 --> 58:30.790
Hang in there, you're okay.

58:30.958 --> 58:33.249
- Take him to the RG.
- Yes, sir.

58:33.416 --> 58:34.374
All set.

58:34.750 --> 58:35.749
Peña, give us a hand.

58:36.125 --> 58:38.582
Will do. Bye, Ramon.

58:38.750 --> 58:39.832
...and three.

58:40.583 --> 58:41.874
- Isa.
- What's up?

58:42.041 --> 58:44.582
Tell Vilches to find a landing zone
for Alpha 2

58:44.750 --> 58:47.540
and Conte that we need
two of his vehicles as a reference.

58:48.208 --> 58:48.999
Anything else?

58:51.291 --> 58:52.624
Ana asked for a divorce.

58:53.541 --> 58:54.415
What?

58:54.875 --> 58:56.249
She wants a normal life.

58:56.416 --> 58:58.624
Just what I can't give her.

58:59.625 --> 59:00.707
Jesus...

59:02.416 --> 59:03.540
I'll...

59:03.791 --> 59:04.457
I'll go do that.

59:06.583 --> 59:07.540
Isa.

59:35.416 --> 59:36.999
Lieutenant.

59:37.791 --> 59:40.207
- Would you like some water?
- Yes, thank you, Sanchez.

59:45.291 --> 59:46.957
How are we on ammo?

59:48.166 --> 59:49.332
Dry.

59:50.875 --> 59:52.915
At most, to repel one attack.

59:54.416 --> 59:56.665
That's your father's medal,
isn't it?

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:05.665
There's something I never understood
about the general.

01:00:06.041 --> 01:00:09.290
How could he like
that beer with lemon crap?

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.999
He drank it by the liter.

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:12.582
My father didn't drink.

01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:17.332
He did with us.

01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:21.749
Your father was a great leader.

01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:26.957
The best man I've served with.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.082
He had the balls to give orders,

01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:32.624
to fight,

01:00:33.666 --> 01:00:36.040
to drink when he had to.

01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:39.999
And to cry, if necessary.

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:47.040
Why are you telling me this?

01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:52.624
With all due respect, because you're driving
me nuts with the damn medal, sir.

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:30.374
This is a last resort.

01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:33.540
Do your job and leave
the fighting to the legionnaires.

01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:36.707
Raquel.

01:01:37.416 --> 01:01:38.999
Everything will be fine.

01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:41.040
Don't worry.

01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:48.082
The hospital is getting
a great doctor.

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:54.457
If the Tigers don't come soon,
they won't get much.

01:02:06.666 --> 01:02:08.665
You're the best soldier
I've ever seen.

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:14.707
You're an extraordinary woman.

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:30.624
Please, take care of yourself.

01:03:40.916 --> 01:03:42.290
Lieutenant.

01:03:42.458 --> 01:03:45.082
I think we could all use
a quote from our creed right now.

01:03:49.416 --> 01:03:51.082
Legionnaire knights,

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:54.790
from our creed,

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:57.707
recite with me
"The Spirit of Death."

01:04:00.541 --> 01:04:01.332
Out loud.

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:04.082
"To die in combat is the greatest honor."

01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:06.749
"To die in combat is the greatest honor."

01:04:06.916 --> 01:04:08.540
"You only die once."

01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:10.457
"You only die once."

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:13.207
<i>"Death comes with no pain."</i>

01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:14.832
"Death comes with no pain."

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:18.290
"And dying isn't as horrible
as it seems."

01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:20.707
"And dying isn't as horrible
as it seems."

01:04:23.416 --> 01:04:25.040
"The most horrible thing is...

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.749
to live on as a coward."

01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:29.957
"...to live on as a coward."

01:04:51.625 --> 01:04:52.499
Take cover!

01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.374
On the ridge!

01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:12.707
Save your ammo!

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.124
Only take good shots!

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.124
Spread out!

01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:20.790
Only gunner and driver
on the vehicles!

01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:24.040
Hit the mortars!

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:33.540
<i>Everyone, hold the perimeter.
I repeat,</i>

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:34.832
hold the perimeter.

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:38.665
Keep them at bay!

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:42.249
Ramirez!

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:43.457
Medic!

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:44.999
Careful!

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:46.582
Now!

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.207
Last clip!

01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:54.290
I'm out!

01:05:56.416 --> 01:05:57.415
God!

01:06:03.708 --> 01:06:05.249
Last clip!

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:07.249
Red!

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.790
Shit!

01:06:12.125 --> 01:06:13.207
Damn!

01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:26.124
Captain, you know they're running
empty, right?

01:06:26.625 --> 01:06:28.665
Damn. Always the life
of the party, Lieutenant.

01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:43.832
<i>This is Ogre 1.
Enemy located.</i>

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.082
Positive identification.

01:06:54.166 --> 01:06:56.374
<i>I'm out. Ogre 2, take over.</i>

01:07:10.041 --> 01:07:12.124
<i>This is Ogre 2. I'm out too.</i>

01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:53.749
<i>Alpha 1, we've opened a window.</i>

01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:14.332
Two, you see the point?

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.874
<i>Alpha 2 here, we see it perfectly.</i>

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:19.540
<i>Go ahead, Alpha 2.
You can land.</i>

01:08:32.916 --> 01:08:33.749
Look at this mess.

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:35.749
It's worse than I thought.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.790
<i>Alpha 2 on the ground.</i>

01:08:37.957 --> 01:08:39.749
<i>Maintaining power
in case the ground gives.</i>

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.957
Okay, have the cargo crew
get off.

01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:49.332
Looks like Santa Claus
just got here.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.832
Let's see what he fucking brought!

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.499
- Who's in charge?
- I am. Lieutenant Conte.

01:08:57.666 --> 01:09:00.790
First Sergeant Rodriguez.
I've got rifle and machine gun ammo.

01:09:00.957 --> 01:09:04.582
Part of it is here and part
where the helicopter landed.

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:05.915
Captain Torres?

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:07.290
Over there.

01:09:08.832 --> 01:09:10.082
Gavilan!

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:11.749
Grab someone
and go get the ammo!

01:09:11.916 --> 01:09:13.207
Jaramillo, give him a hand!

01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:21.374
Maño, Hook, this is Greyhound.
Park vehicles for reference.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.915
- How are you, Captain?
- Everything secure.

01:09:41.082 --> 01:09:43.915
Perfect.
This dust is fucked up, huh?

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:44.999
I know, I know.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.582
Ground to Alpha 1!

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:47.624
<i>This is Alpha 1.</i>

01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:49.332
We're preparing the cargo.

01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:51.415
I'll put you through
to Captain Torres.

01:09:51.582 --> 01:09:53.290
Ramon, go ahead!

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:57.290
Thanks, Luis. Hey, good work
with the reference vehicles.

01:09:57.625 --> 01:09:59.082
<i>Thank you.
Here's Rodriguez.</i>

01:09:59.583 --> 01:10:00.499
Thanks, Captain.

01:10:02.916 --> 01:10:04.499
Ground to Alpha 1.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:06.665
The cargo is ready.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.124
Castro, what do you think?

01:10:24.166 --> 01:10:25.915
Fucked up, sir.

01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:27.332
<i>Really fucked up.</i>

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:29.124
Let's give it a try.

01:10:32.958 --> 01:10:34.040
Cargo in sight.

01:10:34.583 --> 01:10:36.040
Cargo underneath us.

01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:37.290
Out of sight.

01:10:37.708 --> 01:10:38.832
Cargo in sight back here.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.457
<i>Torques 100% joined.</i>

01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:41.874
Preparing hook.

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:43.749
<i>Instruments green.</i>

01:10:43.916 --> 01:10:45.040
<i>Releasing cables.</i>

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:52.124
Cables dropped 100 meters
over vertical.

01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:00.040
Begin descent.

01:11:00.416 --> 01:11:01.749
80 meters...

01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:10.624
<i>70 meters...</i>

01:11:21.458 --> 01:11:23.040
Fucking dust!

01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:25.165
<i>I can't see anything, sir.</i>

01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:27.374
I can, we're good.
Continuing descent.

01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:31.249
40 meters...

01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:41.749
Son of a bitch!

01:11:49.583 --> 01:11:51.124
Still at 40 meters.

01:12:03.666 --> 01:12:05.707
I still can't see anything.
Do you see the references?

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:08.415
<i>Can you see the ground, sir?</i>

01:12:10.416 --> 01:12:11.707
<i>Major?</i>

01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:15.999
Major, should we abort?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.165
Abort.

01:12:29.625 --> 01:12:31.415
Isabel, Isabel!

01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:33.124
What happened, sir?

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:34.374
Who's Conte?

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:41.374
Sorry, Luis.
What happened to you?

01:12:41.541 --> 01:12:43.207
- It's nothing.
- Who's Conte?

01:12:43.375 --> 01:12:44.999
At your service, Major.

01:12:45.291 --> 01:12:46.582
We have to blow up
the MEDEVAC.

01:12:47.333 --> 01:12:48.207
What?

01:12:48.375 --> 01:12:49.999
Luis, I can't see anything.

01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:52.082
I can't see the references
through the dust.

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:54.374
- What do you mean, blow it up?
- Yes, damn it.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.915
You have to take it, sir.

01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:58.832
With all due respect,

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:03.207
you can't imagine what we've been
through for that helicopter.

01:13:04.875 --> 01:13:06.290
There has to be something
you can do.

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:13.374
<i>This is Ogre 1.
We're out of fuel.</i>

01:13:13.541 --> 01:13:15.040
We have to leave.
Good luck.

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:41.874
Okay.

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:44.040
I think I've got it.

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:45.749
Let's see.

01:13:45.916 --> 01:13:48.707
We've got two 25-meter cables,
right?

01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:50.707
We join the two cables.

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:53.749
25 meters and 25 meters.

01:13:53.916 --> 01:13:55.957
From the main hook
of the Chinook.

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:58.040
That's 50 meters.

01:13:58.208 --> 01:13:59.874
No matter how much dust
gets kicked up,

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:03.040
I doubt it'll reach the Chinook.
I'll be able to see the references.

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:06.249
Yeah, but with only one cable,
it'll swing like crazy.

01:14:06.416 --> 01:14:09.374
And if the cable snaps,
it'll whip around and hit the rotor.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:11.707
Luis, what do you think?

01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:12.915
It's your chopper.

01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:18.832
Julia.

01:14:19.791 --> 01:14:20.999
Julia, damn it!

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:23.082
- Okay.
- Shall we try it?

01:14:25.625 --> 01:14:26.290
Let's go.

01:14:29.458 --> 01:14:30.374
Let's go!

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.415
Come on, gentlemen, let's go!

01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:40.624
Luis.

01:14:40.791 --> 01:14:43.249
I'll leave at the end with Rodriguez
and his crew.

01:14:43.416 --> 01:14:45.749
Sanchez, stay with Abda
and the wounded.

01:14:45.958 --> 01:14:47.332
Yes, Captain!

01:14:53.916 --> 01:14:55.249
- Mine.
- Yours.

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.249
<i>Ground, good luck.</i>

01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:18.082
Let's go get it.

01:15:27.666 --> 01:15:29.332
Cargo over vertical.

01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:33.540
<i>Don't drift too far right, sir.</i>

01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:37.957
Begin descent.

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:39.499
<i>80 meters...</i>

01:15:52.208 --> 01:15:53.415
<i>70 meters...</i>

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:56.082
I can't see anything, sir.
Like before.

01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:58.999
I can, I see the reference points.
Continuing descent.

01:15:59.958 --> 01:16:01.165
60 meters.

01:16:01.416 --> 01:16:03.165
<i>Don't back up, keep descending.</i>

01:16:04.416 --> 01:16:05.457
50 meters.

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:06.790
Stop.

01:16:23.875 --> 01:16:25.124
Releasing cable.

01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:27.249
Torques 100% joined.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.540
Preparing hook.

01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:30.124
Everything green.

01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:30.957
Releasing cable.

01:16:35.541 --> 01:16:36.540
Cable released.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.332
<i>Major, this is control.</i>

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:47.290
The insurgents are back.

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:49.582
They're regrouping.
Prepare for

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.082
<i>- an attack.</i>
- Quickly, ground.

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:56.832
- RPG on the right!
- Motherfucker!

01:16:58.791 --> 01:17:00.290
The cable is swinging!

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:04.082
Carranza!

01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:07.540
Shit!

01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:16.457
Come on, baby!

01:17:27.291 --> 01:17:28.499
Ground to Alpha 1.

01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:30.249
<i>Cargo is hooked!</i>

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:31.457
Begin ascent.

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.874
Cable tense, continue ascent.

01:17:39.125 --> 01:17:41.415
Sir, over vertical!

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:43.040
Six feet higher!

01:17:45.916 --> 01:17:47.415
Careful, don't drift left.

01:17:47.583 --> 01:17:48.832
<i>Keep rising.</i>

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.624
The cargo is vertical!

01:17:55.791 --> 01:17:57.040
Keep rising!

01:18:03.541 --> 01:18:04.665
Medic!

01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:06.040
Medic!

01:18:18.708 --> 01:18:20.124
70 meters.

01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:21.374
Free to fly.

01:18:31.458 --> 01:18:32.415
Ground, gather your team.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.082
<i>We're coming for you.</i>

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:35.207
Alpha 2,

01:18:35.375 --> 01:18:37.749
<i>- go down for them.
- Copy that, initiating maneuver.</i>

01:18:37.916 --> 01:18:39.957
Gunners, cover Alpha 2.

01:19:00.375 --> 01:19:03.332
Quit screwing around
and get on board!

01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:12.082
Jaramillo, in the valley!

01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:19.832
Captain, we need to get
the hell out of here.

01:19:20.166 --> 01:19:21.874
If we get lost,

01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:24.540
look for the heat
of the engines.

01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:25.957
Give me the okay.

01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:29.499
We move on three.

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:30.499
Three!

01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:40.332
Fuck!

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:44.040
<i>The cargo is swinging.</i>

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:58.624
Carranza! RPG!

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:07.124
Red!

01:20:08.083 --> 01:20:09.040
Green!

01:20:13.333 --> 01:20:15.207
It's spinning, sir!

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:28.790
Jesus!

01:20:29.375 --> 01:20:32.082
I'm here! Hold on!

01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:51.790
Alpha 2 at 9 o'clock.

01:20:51.958 --> 01:20:52.749
I know, I'm on it!

01:21:17.041 --> 01:21:17.999
Damn it...

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:45.332
Shit.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.249
Mine! Mine!

01:22:31.666 --> 01:22:33.207
The cargo is stabilizing.

01:22:46.083 --> 01:22:46.832
I've got it!

01:22:47.625 --> 01:22:48.999
Lieutenant, help me!

01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:51.499
We have to get him
to the Chinook.

01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:08.665
Sanchez, you take it.

01:23:29.916 --> 01:23:31.374
<i>Alpha 1, all set.</i>

01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:33.165
<i>All personnel aboard.</i>

01:23:33.333 --> 01:23:34.707
<i>Alpha 2, give us cover.</i>

01:23:34.875 --> 01:23:35.790
We're rising.

01:23:41.083 --> 01:23:42.665
Let's go, gentlemen!

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:07.332
- It's a car bomb!
- Jaramillo, don't ram it!

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.249
Aguilar, hit the pick-up!

01:24:33.583 --> 01:24:35.832
Damn it!
They're trapped.

01:24:38.166 --> 01:24:39.499
They're trapped. Luis!

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:40.707
They're trapped!

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:41.624
Sergeant.

01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:47.040
Ledesma, do you copy?

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:49.749
<i>Listen, the legionnaires
are trapped.</i>

01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:50.582
We have to go back
for them.

01:24:51.416 --> 01:24:52.332
Shit.

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:53.790
What do we do?

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.082
We have to dump the MEDEVAC.

01:24:58.333 --> 01:25:00.499
They're carrying the wounded,
it has to be us.

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:02.165
Are you sure, sir?

01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:03.249
Completely.

01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:04.832
Prepare hooks.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.499
Preparing hooks.

01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:12.915
<i>Hook prepared.</i>

01:25:15.041 --> 01:25:16.040
Ready to cut.

01:25:17.583 --> 01:25:18.915
Stop, stop, stop!

01:25:22.125 --> 01:25:24.165
<i>Ogre 3 to Alpha1, do you copy?</i>

01:25:26.666 --> 01:25:28.207
God bless your eyes, Major.

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:31.165
<i>Copy that, over.</i>

01:25:31.333 --> 01:25:34.082
<i>You almost missed the party, Ogre 3.
Did you bring gifts?</i>

01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:37.582
<i>Affirmative. Refueled and reloaded.
Can you mark the target?</i>

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:40.540
<i>Target marked by laser
from Romeo Golf. Positive ID.</i>

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:42.457
Ready to fire.

01:25:59.083 --> 01:26:00.957
<i>Come on, go, go, go.</i>

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:08.457
Come on, let's move our asses!

01:26:20.458 --> 01:26:21.582
Good work, everyone.

01:26:22.083 --> 01:26:23.332
Bravo!

01:26:27.041 --> 01:26:28.082
Jose!

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:29.749
Yes, sir!

01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:33.124
When we reach the base,
the beers are on me!

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:38.707
Are you a Real Madrid fan
like your dad?

01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:40.957
To the death!

01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:43.624
Then you can forget it,
Lieutenant!

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.332
Let me see...

01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:03.790
All good, Abda.

01:27:23.791 --> 01:27:25.207
I'll tell you something.

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:28.499
You're a bunch of fucking lunatics.
I'll never ride with you again.

01:28:10.458 --> 01:28:12.832
DEDICATED TO THE MEMBERS
OF THE ARMED FORCES

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.249
