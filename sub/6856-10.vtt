Directed by Atsushi Takeuchi

00:23.150 --> 00:25.110
Viceroy Gunray escapes!

00:25.600 --> 00:28.650
En route to Coruscant to stand trial for war crimes,

00:28.660 --> 00:32.674
evil Separatist leader Nute Gunray
has broken free of his Jedi escort.

00:32.676 --> 00:35.375
With the help of Count Dooku's sinister agents,

00:35.376 --> 00:38.112
the villainous viceroy has made a daring getaway.

00:41.635 --> 00:43.699
Alerted to the bold prison break,

00:43.700 --> 00:47.593
Jedi Master Kit Fisto has traced the
stolen ship to a remote system,

00:47.610 --> 00:51.265
hoping to recapture Gunray and return him to justice.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.800
I know we're in the middle of nowhere, R6,

00:57.801 --> 01:00.097
but that's the Republic beacon we're looking for.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.926
Contact the Outer Rim command.

01:08.490 --> 01:09.800
Master Luminara,

01:09.810 --> 01:13.529
I have tracked the location of
our stolen ship to the Vassek system.

01:13.530 --> 01:16.095
So has your old Padawan, Nahdar Vebb.

01:16.359 --> 01:18.009
He's already on the surface.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.277
It'll be great to see Nahdar again.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.057
I'll transmit the coordinates for the rendezvous point.

01:23.058 --> 01:24.450
And Master Fisto,

01:24.510 --> 01:27.400
sorry we lost that slimy double-dealer.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.895
Don't worry, Ahsoka,

01:28.896 --> 01:30.512
we'll catch Gunray yet.

01:30.770 --> 01:31.775
Good hunting.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.500

01:54.420 --> 01:56.103
Well, I can't see anything either.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.200
You'll be fine, R6.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.770
Just keep a lookout for me, okay?

02:02.950 --> 02:03.850
Nahdar.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.179
Congratulations on passing the trials.

02:07.180 --> 02:11.140
I'm sorry the war prevented me from
seeing your traing through to the end.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.340
You were missed, Master,

02:13.341 --> 02:16.900
but it is an honor to finally
serve beside you as a Knight.

02:16.901 --> 02:17.631
General,

02:17.661 --> 02:21.070
we've pinpointed the tracking beacon's
location to the south end of the gorge.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.026
Then let's have a look.

02:23.355 --> 02:25.010
Allow me to show the way.

02:32.987 --> 02:33.987
Charming.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.160
Let's not keep the Viceroy waiting.

02:37.078 --> 02:38.971
Niner, Bel, look after the ships.

02:39.110 --> 02:40.110
Yes, sir.

02:44.979 --> 02:46.180
No guards?

02:46.620 --> 02:47.500
That's odd.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.956
The entrance looks sealed.

02:48.957 --> 02:51.656
We specialize in making entrances.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.510
This will make less noise.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.228
Patience, the both of you.

02:58.650 --> 03:00.977
A second look usually pays off.

03:03.075 --> 03:04.075
What's this?

03:11.695 --> 03:14.050
I sense there's something here.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.815
Scanners are negative, General.

03:26.866 --> 03:28.455
Well, that was something.

03:36.789 --> 03:38.552
All droids stay on guard.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.756
Be ready for anything.

03:40.925 --> 03:41.790
Roger, roger.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.932
Double shifts for everyone.

03:49.686 --> 03:51.096
Uh, Viceroy?

03:51.097 --> 03:53.590
You must protect me at all costs.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.390
Uh, Viceroy, the Jedi are here.

03:57.225 --> 03:58.115
I know they're near.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.776
Once those Jedi pick up my trail,

04:00.777 --> 04:01.976
they never leave me alone.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.099
They're right behind you.

04:04.363 --> 04:05.474
What? Where?

04:05.915 --> 04:06.780
Do something.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.377
You! Blast them!

04:24.100 --> 04:26.429
I didn't forget to teach you restraint,

04:26.430 --> 04:27.760
did I, my old Padawan?

04:28.231 --> 04:29.630
I am sorry, Master.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.320
I got carried away.

04:31.321 --> 04:34.700
Those who have power should
restrain themselves from using it.

04:35.212 --> 04:36.179
Lieutenant.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.988
Did you get them?

04:37.989 --> 04:40.811
No, but we have you, Viceroy.

04:40.812 --> 04:43.665
You have nothing, Jedi fools.

04:43.667 --> 04:46.407
I welcome you to your doom.

04:49.059 --> 04:50.529
The tracking beacon.

04:50.530 --> 04:51.976
They knew we were coming.

04:51.977 --> 04:54.204
I should have known Gunray wasn't here.

04:54.255 --> 04:55.459
At the first sight of us,

04:55.460 --> 04:57.925
he would have run off screaming like the coward he is.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.469
I apologize for the deception, Master Jedi.

05:03.796 --> 05:04.861
Count Dooku.

05:05.256 --> 05:08.406
You have a great talent for unexpected appearances.

05:08.407 --> 05:11.500
It's a shame you came so far to be frustrated.

05:11.985 --> 05:15.180
While the Viceroy is unavailable for capture,

05:15.550 --> 05:18.515
allow me to offer you an alternative prize.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.890
This has got to be a trap.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.127
It looks like Dooku is trying to catch someone,

05:26.350 --> 05:27.850
and we're the bait.

05:27.855 --> 05:30.650
But who has the trap been set to catch?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.688
Shall we find out?

06:00.700 --> 06:04.380
This place looks like a shrine to that strange warrior.

06:18.725 --> 06:20.861
This is the lair of General Grievous.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.200
[Belbullab-22 starfighter, "Soulless One"]

06:27.423 --> 06:29.195
Yes, my lord?

06:29.396 --> 06:34.096
General, the ongoing stalemate
in the war has become unacceptable.

06:34.579 --> 06:37.568
There is concern you have lost your focus.

06:37.569 --> 06:41.236
Lord Sidious demands more dramatic results,

06:41.285 --> 06:43.823
more dead Jedi.

06:44.050 --> 06:46.815
You expect victory over Jedi,

06:46.816 --> 06:50.201
but all you give me to fight them is battle droids.

06:58.575 --> 07:02.205
These must be trophies taken from the Jedi he's murdered.

07:02.795 --> 07:04.375
There are so many.

07:05.590 --> 07:08.790
Why would Dooku want to set a trap for his best General?

07:09.210 --> 07:10.888
It doesn't make sense.

07:11.101 --> 07:14.388
Are we the bait, or is Grievous the bait?

07:14.389 --> 07:16.755
We must consider who this trap is for.

07:16.756 --> 07:19.484
General, your droid is tracking an incoming ship.

07:20.325 --> 07:22.650
It matches a description of General Grievous' fighter.

07:22.651 --> 07:23.614
It's headed our way.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.804
Keep out of sight and stand by for further orders.

07:27.218 --> 07:30.191
Capturing Grievous could turn the tide of the war.

07:30.392 --> 07:32.415
And if he doesn't know we're here,

07:32.796 --> 07:34.585
we could take him down easy.

07:35.110 --> 07:36.795
Don't underestimate him.

07:36.926 --> 07:38.215
We'll need a plan.

07:58.150 --> 07:59.300
Guards?

08:00.012 --> 08:00.835
Gore?

08:02.200 --> 08:04.796
Gore, where are you?

08:09.400 --> 08:10.720
Welcome home, General.

08:10.821 --> 08:13.356
I'm afraid I must request your surrender.

08:23.390 --> 08:24.669
Cooperate, Grievous,

08:24.685 --> 08:27.000
and perhaps the Senate will be merciful.

08:27.001 --> 08:30.009
It is you who shall get no mercy.

08:43.049 --> 08:43.751
Cables!

08:51.900 --> 08:52.876
Don't let him go!

08:54.000 --> 08:54.825
We got him.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.194
Don't let him cut the lines!

09:02.195 --> 09:03.150
Hold him.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.326
Don't make me destroy you.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.991
Come and get me.

09:34.135 --> 09:35.415
Cut him off!

10:03.000 --> 10:03.775
Where'd he go?

10:03.776 --> 10:05.653
The clones got in the way.

10:05.654 --> 10:06.911
I could have taken him.

10:09.559 --> 10:11.588
Let's take care of our wounded.

10:17.515 --> 10:19.795
Doctor, where are you?

10:20.220 --> 10:22.500
Don't be upset with me, master.

10:22.624 --> 10:24.099
If you were a better fighter,

10:24.100 --> 10:26.285
we would not be having this conversation.

10:28.335 --> 10:30.700
Look what you let those Jedi do to you.

10:30.701 --> 10:32.338
You're a walking scrap pile.

10:32.690 --> 10:33.801
What a mess.

10:33.805 --> 10:37.593
It's going to take me forever to
get you back into decent shape.

10:37.987 --> 10:39.955
I'll go fetch your spare parts.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.659
What happened to my bodyguards?

10:50.750 --> 10:53.310
They were remotely deactivated for recharge.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.659
I thought you did it.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.010
Lock down the perimeter.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.182
Let me go after Grievous myself, Master.

11:20.183 --> 11:21.438
Patience, Nahdar.

11:21.897 --> 11:23.715
You may no longer be a Padawan,

11:23.790 --> 11:26.362
but you are not ready to take on Grievous.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.973
It's time we retreated.

11:32.876 --> 11:35.832
You are not going anywhere.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.355
It looks like we're going to have to fight after all.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.885
Green scout to watcher base.

11:45.985 --> 11:46.669
Copy.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.135
This is watcher base, over.

11:48.390 --> 11:49.930
Contact the fleet at Besteene.

11:50.231 --> 11:53.110
Inform them we've engaged Grievous
and require reinforcements.

11:53.111 --> 11:53.932
Right away, sir.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.800
[Nu-class attack shuttle]

11:59.200 --> 12:01.500
Better warm up the shuttle's long-range transmitter.

12:18.850 --> 12:20.768
Get out of there, R6, now!

12:36.446 --> 12:37.958
R6? R6?

12:39.350 --> 12:41.490
You've run out of time.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.298
Why don't you come out, General?

12:43.299 --> 12:45.978
Show us some of that Separatist hospitality.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.415
Patience.

12:47.416 --> 12:48.726
In the meantime,

12:48.729 --> 12:52.382
please experience all my home has to offer.

12:52.483 --> 12:57.285
It has been prepared for uninvited guests like you.

13:15.970 --> 13:18.198
General, I know you're watching.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.800
We've seen the lower levels of your home.

13:21.150 --> 13:23.000
We're not impressed.

13:25.230 --> 13:28.100
Good, Jedi, good.

13:28.101 --> 13:31.540
You will provide some sport for me yet.

13:33.700 --> 13:37.250
Gore, time to entertain our guests.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.525
Stand firm.

13:47.140 --> 13:49.439
There might be worse things here than Grievous.

13:51.650 --> 13:53.379
It looks like you're right about that, sir.

14:01.305 --> 14:03.335
Good-bye, Jedi.

14:06.950 --> 14:09.200
Master, the armor patches are getting cold,

14:09.201 --> 14:12.551
and contrary to your belief,
I do have other things to do.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.376
Proceed with my repair.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.181
Sometimes I wonder why you submitted to the changes.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.857
Improvements.

14:20.858 --> 14:22.795
I submit to no one.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.611
I chose them.

14:24.612 --> 14:26.238
Now get on with it.

14:35.735 --> 14:38.600
There may be some discomfort.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.630
Shoot him, commander!

15:34.070 --> 15:35.935
Grievous is going to pay for this.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.300
I will destroy him.

15:39.222 --> 15:40.798
I understand your pain,

15:41.182 --> 15:42.873
but you forget your teachings, Nahdar.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.400
Revenge is not the Jedi way.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.000
But in this war, strength prevails.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.350
The rules have changed.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.563
Perhaps you are the one who has changed.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.599
Come now, we need to keep moving.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.200
Let's see if Gore is finished playing with the Jedi.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.200
Huh?

16:14.678 --> 16:15.869
Where are they?

16:16.940 --> 16:17.840
Gore?

16:21.820 --> 16:26.370
Master, you have an incoming
transmission from Count Dooku.

16:28.231 --> 16:32.966
General, I understand the Jedi
have infiltrated your lair.

16:33.500 --> 16:40.795
Your recent defeats at their hands have shaken
my faith in your ability to lead the droid army.

16:41.500 --> 16:46.078
I'm sure you can understand my
need to reassess your effectiveness.

16:47.120 --> 16:47.970
You!

16:48.150 --> 16:50.676
You deactivated my guards.

16:50.677 --> 16:55.839
You let the Jedi in here so you would test me.

16:56.190 --> 16:59.869
I do hope you emerge victorious.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.100
Ha!

17:02.030 --> 17:03.380
It's time for you to prove--

17:03.380 --> 17:04.076
Oops.

17:04.700 --> 17:05.939
All right, Count.

17:05.940 --> 17:08.308
I'll play your little game.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.150
In your condition, you need your rest.

17:12.550 --> 17:15.615
I will rest when the Jedi are dead.

17:23.536 --> 17:24.599
You were right, Master.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.656
That exit must lead to the control room.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.870
Oh, what have we here?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.156
The uninvited guests.

17:40.630 --> 17:41.430
Let's go.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.850
Master, the Jedi are about
to enter the control room.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.890
Nahdar, inside, hurry!

17:48.891 --> 17:49.500
No, you go.

17:49.501 --> 17:50.537
I will hold him off.

17:50.588 --> 17:52.300
There's no time to argue.

17:52.301 --> 17:53.486
We can't just run.

17:53.487 --> 17:54.599
We must finish him.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.050
Nahdar, hurry!

17:59.880 --> 18:01.569
I have been waiting for this.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.486
Nahdar!

18:14.259 --> 18:16.479
Greetings, young Jedi.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.800
Where is your Master?

18:20.801 --> 18:22.000
How exciting.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.938
You will find out soon enough.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.815
You can't defeat us all.

18:25.816 --> 18:27.685
Of course I can.

18:30.550 --> 18:31.669
Get him, master.

18:31.670 --> 18:32.805
Kill him.

18:33.732 --> 18:34.418
Wait.

18:34.419 --> 18:35.715
Where's the other Jedi?

18:36.532 --> 18:37.477
Oh, no.

18:52.835 --> 18:53.650
No.

18:58.031 --> 19:00.150
I will kill you all.

19:00.151 --> 19:02.191
Do you hear me, Jedi?

19:03.339 --> 19:04.239
R6?

19:04.400 --> 19:05.279
Is that you?

19:07.192 --> 19:09.028
Meet me at the south landing platform.

19:09.029 --> 19:10.233
I'll be right there.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.390
I'm coming for you next, Fisto.

19:14.658 --> 19:16.850
I'll be gone by the time you get here.

19:24.157 --> 19:25.885
R6, I'm at the platform.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.100
Where are you?

19:32.550 --> 19:34.295
Going somewhere?

19:47.030 --> 19:48.060
Huh?

19:58.400 --> 20:00.816
You might have been a proud warrior once,

20:00.817 --> 20:03.784
but now you're just a pawn in Dooku's game.

20:03.785 --> 20:07.024
I wield great power, Jedi fool.

20:13.063 --> 20:15.663
That power will only consume you.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.570
How quickly power can change hands.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.951
Surrender, and I promise you will die quickly.

21:03.700 --> 21:04.721
Stop him!

21:11.300 --> 21:13.065
Let's go home, R6.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.480
Count Dooku, the Jedi have been defeated.

21:24.550 --> 21:28.550
Victory over the clones and the young Jedi was expected,

21:28.720 --> 21:31.509
but to best a Jedi Master...

21:31.600 --> 21:35.968
This is truly an accomplishment worthy of recognition.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.200
The Jedi Fisto escaped.

21:40.701 --> 21:43.437
So there is room for improvement.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.850
What about your former Padawan?

21:52.265 --> 21:54.300
His heart was in the right place,

21:54.350 --> 21:57.350
but he tried to answer Grievous' power with his own.

21:57.600 --> 22:02.026
To answer power with power,
the Jedi way this is not.

22:02.330 --> 22:07.330
In this war, a danger there is
of losing who we are.
