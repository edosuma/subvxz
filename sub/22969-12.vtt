WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.771
Colonel, we have to perform
the Tethering Ceremony.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.040
You have three excellent
candidates in front of you.
Please pick one.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.608
Look, "The Selection of One."

00:07.608 --> 00:09.743
Jenkins: Fight to the death
between Librarians.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.780
I am the Library.
If you disobey my instructions,

00:12.780 --> 00:16.150
- I will kill Jenkins.
- ( screams )

00:16.150 --> 00:17.718
- It took Jenkins.
- Ezekiel and Cassie: I resign.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.953
Stone: I resign from the post
of Librarian.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.789
- Baird: This was you?
- Nicole: This has always
been me.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.225
- ( grunts )
- I killed the idea
of the Library.

00:24.225 --> 00:28.162
The only place
the Library exists now
is in your memories,

00:28.162 --> 00:33.234
and soon those too
shall fade.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.536
If Martin Luther
had had his way,

00:35.536 --> 00:37.771
bowling would be called
platzbahnkegeln,

00:37.771 --> 00:39.673
and there would only
be nine pins,

00:39.673 --> 00:41.242
but since we are
socially conditioned

00:41.242 --> 00:43.711
to finding order
in sets of ten...

00:43.711 --> 00:45.146
Why am I talking to you?

00:47.115 --> 00:48.116
Flynn.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.750
Nicole.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.420
I thought you left.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.587
I did.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.022
I want you
to come with me.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.324
( inhales sharply )

00:56.324 --> 00:58.492
Look, you're already packed.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.060
Nicole, when you told me
that I should fight against

01:00.060 --> 01:03.764
being a prisoner
of this place,
I realized...

01:03.764 --> 01:05.999
I'm not a prisoner
of this place.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.201
The Library
pushes me forward,

01:07.201 --> 01:08.969
it doesn't hold me back.

01:08.969 --> 01:09.970
Like Baird.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.572
Baird?

01:11.572 --> 01:12.740
Baird.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.708
To whom I owe
a bowling date,

01:14.708 --> 01:17.411
and with whom I intend
to tether to the Library.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.281
I don't want to be
uncertain anymore.

01:20.281 --> 01:24.352
I love the Library
and I love... Baird.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.719
And I'm ready.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.456
I see.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.125
I'm sorry.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.260
Uh, you know,
I wish--

01:32.260 --> 01:33.527
No, I'm sorry.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.628
( grunts )

01:37.765 --> 01:39.833
I should have specified...

01:39.833 --> 01:41.835
I wasn't asking.

01:41.835 --> 01:42.836
( soft chuckle )

01:42.836 --> 01:45.439
( theme music playing )

01:52.613 --> 01:55.249
- ( music playing )
- ( alarm blaring )

02:19.707 --> 02:21.141
You must
remember the Library

02:21.141 --> 02:22.876
or it'll be
gone forever.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.616
Flynn's tethering ring.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.652
I remember Flynn
from the-- the Library.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.521
( sighs )
How do you hold something

02:33.521 --> 02:34.922
as big as the Library
in your head?

02:34.922 --> 02:37.958
Flynn keeps everything
in his head using...

02:37.958 --> 02:40.728
um...

02:40.728 --> 02:42.296
a memory palace.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.001
( exhales )
I did it!

02:48.001 --> 02:50.338
I'm here!
( laughs )

02:50.338 --> 02:53.807
Okay, I just have to focus
on specific things

02:53.807 --> 02:56.109
and everything else will
fill into place around it.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.245
Okay.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.112
( panting )
Ah!

02:59.112 --> 03:00.414
The Spear of Destiny!

03:00.414 --> 03:01.749
( chuckles )
Yes!

03:01.749 --> 03:05.152
Okay.
And then... um...

03:05.152 --> 03:06.354
here,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.256
The Lions!
The Lions!

03:08.256 --> 03:10.023
Yeah. Whoo!

03:10.023 --> 03:12.360
And right there is...

03:12.360 --> 03:13.361
that's the, um...

03:13.361 --> 03:14.528
the Ark...

03:14.528 --> 03:15.996
the Ark of
the Covenant! Yes!

03:15.996 --> 03:17.365
I remember it.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.732
I remember it all.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.067
Okay.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.335
Okay, I did it.

03:21.335 --> 03:24.638
So where are you, Flynn?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.206
Where am I gonna
find you?

03:27.241 --> 03:28.709
"TV"?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.511
Okay.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.880
Let's go find a TV.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.307
Fat and Flour?

03:59.307 --> 04:00.608
That all they serve?

04:01.975 --> 04:02.976
What else is there?

04:13.554 --> 04:16.189
Announcer on TV:
It's the "I Fell Down!" show!

04:16.189 --> 04:18.392
- ( audience applauds on TV )
- Because everyone falls down.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.194
The only entertainment
you'll ever need.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.530
( slide whistle plays )

04:22.530 --> 04:24.665
- ( laughter )
- ( canned laughter )

04:24.665 --> 04:26.300
And now, here's your host...

04:26.300 --> 04:28.135
- ( TV static )
- Eve?

04:28.135 --> 04:30.971
Flynn?
Flynn, where are you?
What's going on?

04:30.971 --> 04:33.507
To answer your first question,
no, I can't hear you.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.343
- That wasn't my...
- This is a recording.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.645
I've transmitted it
directly into the glass
of my tethering ring,

04:37.645 --> 04:38.979
where it's stored
kind of like a hard drive.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.614
And if you're seeing this,
that means

04:40.614 --> 04:42.015
that you've found the ring
and that Nicole is close

04:42.015 --> 04:43.617
to completing her goal.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.953
Eve, brace yourself.

04:45.953 --> 04:46.954
Nicole is evil.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.422
Ya think?

04:48.422 --> 04:49.523
Da, da, da, da, da!

04:49.523 --> 04:50.891
Before you go
and defend her,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.493
she hit me on the head
and kidnapped me.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.762
Her plan is to get us
to abandon the Library.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.564
With it being untethered,
it would create a world

04:56.564 --> 04:58.599
not only where the Library
ceases to exist,

04:58.599 --> 05:00.568
but where it has
never existed.

05:00.568 --> 05:04.004
- ( imitates explosion )
- But how does the Library
never existing

05:04.004 --> 05:05.573
make it so food
doesn't have flavor

05:05.573 --> 05:06.807
or color doesn't exist?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.842
As you know,
the Library is much more

05:08.842 --> 05:10.611
than a storehouse
for artifacts,

05:10.611 --> 05:11.845
it is where we keep
our knowledge.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.547
And without the Library,
that knowledge

05:13.547 --> 05:15.549
would cease to have any value,
it would have no place.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.685
All intellect, all curiosity
would become worthless.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.753
I cannot even imagine what it's
like where you are right now

05:19.753 --> 05:21.422
in that world.
What is it like?

05:21.422 --> 05:23.357
Um, I mean,
it's a little--

05:23.357 --> 05:24.392
I keep forgetting,
this a recording,

05:24.392 --> 05:25.426
I can't hear you.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.694
- ( sighs )
- Anyway,

05:26.694 --> 05:28.228
to get our world back,

05:28.228 --> 05:29.963
you need to hold onto
your memories of the Library.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.932
Your new reality is gonna
try and wipe out the old,

05:31.932 --> 05:35.202
so you're gonna need to build
what's called a memory palace.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.204
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I already did that,
skip ahead, skip ahead.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.172
But you're very smart,
you probably already did that.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.074
Aw, sweetie.
Thank you.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.444
You need to find me
before you forget.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.945
And the others.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.314
It will take all of us together
to get the Library back.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.383
How? Ugh.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.685
I don't even know
where to begin.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.986
She's coming.
I have to go!

05:52.986 --> 05:54.488
( TV static )

05:54.488 --> 05:56.356
Announcer:
We'll be back
after these messages.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.125
- ( audience applause )
- Hey...

05:58.125 --> 06:01.061
do you need a way to get
from one place to another?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.830
Do you want to do
that in a car?

06:02.830 --> 06:03.664
Come on down

06:03.664 --> 06:05.733
to The Company's
Used Car.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.901
Where every car
is perfectly average.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.538
Come on down
and see me,

06:10.538 --> 06:11.739
Jacob Stone.

06:11.739 --> 06:16.109
Well, that's...
one place to start.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.721
Baird:
Spear.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.923
Lions,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.459
Ark.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.827
( sighs )

06:39.066 --> 06:41.469
- Stone!
- Well, hello, little lady!

06:41.469 --> 06:43.136
- Can I help you?
- I...

06:43.136 --> 06:44.438
Of course I can.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.739
No one can choose
between these fine cars

06:45.739 --> 06:47.307
without a little
of assistance.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.577
Let me ask you a question:
how do you feel about brown?

06:49.577 --> 06:50.911
I don't really
feel anything.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.713
Well, that's exactly right.
You're not meant to.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.616
This is perfect
for basic conveyance.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.518
Do you remember me?

06:57.518 --> 07:00.320
- Should I?
- Think, Stone.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.489
We used to
work together

07:01.489 --> 07:02.990
with a group
of amazing people

07:02.990 --> 07:04.692
who do
incredible things.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.994
Do you have any
memory of that?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.896
Listen, lady,
I don't know what you're--

07:08.896 --> 07:11.832
I'm talking
about The Library.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.635
The Li...

07:16.003 --> 07:17.004
That was a dream.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.438
You remember.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.041
I've never told
anyone about that.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.643
You-- this--
I've dreamt about that

07:22.643 --> 07:23.977
since I was a little boy.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.345
You...

07:25.345 --> 07:27.380
you are the thought police.
I can't--

07:27.380 --> 07:29.382
- The what? No.
- I can't be talking
to you right now, okay?

07:29.382 --> 07:30.851
- Stone...
- I can get in trouble.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.352
...you are the world's
leading authority

07:32.352 --> 07:35.055
on art, architecture,
history.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.725
You've travelled the world
and dug up mummies,

07:37.725 --> 07:39.326
and solved ancient
puzzle boxes

07:39.326 --> 07:41.328
that have stumped
scholars for centuries.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.863
This can't be real.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.664
It is.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.600
It's not a dream.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.536
You are not a used
car salesman, Jacob Stone.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.370
You?

07:50.370 --> 07:51.905
You're a Librarian.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.209
And if you come with me,
I'll prove it to you.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.050
Okay.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.051
Yeah.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.086
Uh, oh, a test drive?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.454
Yeah, yeah.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.489
Yeah, we could do
a test drive.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.025
( engine starts )

08:16.429 --> 08:18.398
Yes.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.534
Yes, she's with him now.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.236
They're going someplace.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.105
I don't know.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.041
She just appeared
out of nowhere.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.079
- Where are we going?
- To find the others.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.081
Although I have no idea
where I might do that.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.449
You can always look them up
in The Company directory.

08:36.449 --> 08:37.851
Company directory?

08:37.851 --> 08:40.420
Yeah, everyone,
in one way or another,

08:40.420 --> 08:41.689
works for The Company.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.056
Me included.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.125
Does this company
have a name?

08:45.125 --> 08:47.494
"The Company."

08:47.494 --> 08:49.830
Creative.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.032
What does
The Company do?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.068
You know, I never
thought to ask.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.774
( music playing )

09:17.958 --> 09:19.693
Cillian!

09:20.761 --> 09:22.195
Your stapling has
fallen off center

09:22.195 --> 09:23.430
by an entire millimeter.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.198
But I staple the NRW report
to the PDX report

09:25.198 --> 09:26.600
in the exact same
spot every time.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.569
Was your mind
wandering again, Cillian?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.071
We don't want to have
to report a problem.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.405
No, sir.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.374
My stapling will be perfectly
centered from now on.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.943
See that it is.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.011
Your reports
are backing up!

09:38.011 --> 09:39.412
( sighs )

09:39.412 --> 09:41.081
Cassandra.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.349
How do you
know my name?

09:42.349 --> 09:43.483
We're here
to help you.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.785
I promise,

09:44.785 --> 09:46.053
my stapling will
be perfectly centered.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.254
I don't need
oversight.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.856
That's not what I meant.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.693
You look familiar.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.461
Both of you.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.329
Have we met before?

09:56.329 --> 09:58.298
I think maybe.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.733
In a dream.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.601
Okay.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.136
It's been nice
talking to you.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.738
- I need to get back to work.
- What? No, no.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.806
I just saw it
in your eyes.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.940
You've had the dream!

10:06.940 --> 10:09.242
Baird:
Cassandra, it wasn't a dream.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.944
It's a memory.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.780
A memory
of the Library.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.648
I don't know
any Library.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.150
It's a place...

10:17.150 --> 10:19.987
um...

10:19.987 --> 10:22.589
um, it's a place...

10:22.589 --> 10:23.791
( sighs )
Right there was the...

10:24.958 --> 10:26.626
What was it?
It was...

10:26.626 --> 10:28.295
( sighs )
Okay.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.262
Right there

10:29.262 --> 10:31.264
was...
kitty, kitty, kitty.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.399
The Lions.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.035
And right there
was the-- the Ark!

10:35.035 --> 10:37.337
Okay, I still have it.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.572
I still have
the Library.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.109
Look, I can't have someone
who's dressed like
the thought police

10:42.109 --> 10:43.677
questioning me
about a library.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.678
I have a backup.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.213
Hey, I get it.

10:47.681 --> 10:48.849
I do.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.318
If you don't
do your part,

10:51.318 --> 10:53.653
then everything
stops, right?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.388
- That's right.
- Right.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.791
You don't have time
for anything else.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.628
You don't have
time for dreams.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.297
Dreams about a place

11:04.297 --> 11:05.298
with endless books,

11:05.298 --> 11:07.801
amazing artifacts.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.671
And stuff like this.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.673
Give that back,
they'll see it.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.908
What is it?

11:14.908 --> 11:17.845
I don't know.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.379
But it's beautiful.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.513
Baird:
It is.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.784
Cassandra, you're
a mathematical genius,

11:23.784 --> 11:26.887
with a brain that can connect
Einstein's Theory of Relativity

11:26.887 --> 11:29.356
to the smell
of pancake syrup.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.692
Come with us.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.829
I...

11:35.829 --> 11:38.799
No, I want to stay here
and keep doing my stapling.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.567
I don't want anyone
to think that I'm a problem.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.535
Too late for that.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.873
Is there something
I can help you gentlemen with?

11:51.611 --> 11:53.146
I haven't seen anything...

11:53.146 --> 11:54.848
( whispers )
I can't believe
you did this to me.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.049
Cassandra,
quick question:

11:56.049 --> 11:57.317
is there another
way out of here?

12:00.788 --> 12:03.390
We're looking
for Cassandra Cillian.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.792
Her desk
is right here.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.735
We won't reach the exit
without being seen.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.170
( paper rustling )

12:17.971 --> 12:19.306
I got this.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.778
( tube thudding )

12:24.778 --> 12:26.679
Go!

12:26.679 --> 12:28.782
What is that?

12:28.782 --> 12:30.317
Supervisor:
The tubes are jammed!

12:30.317 --> 12:32.652
She stapled
off-center!

12:32.652 --> 12:34.554
Oh, no!

12:34.554 --> 12:36.023
( explosion )

12:36.023 --> 12:38.425
Supervisor:
No, no!

12:38.425 --> 12:40.660
This is not my fault.
This is not my fault!

12:40.660 --> 12:41.862
This way!

12:46.299 --> 12:47.434
This way.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.970
- ( knocking on door )
- Hey!

12:49.970 --> 12:51.071
That should hold them.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.305
( sighs )
That was close.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.540
Now we just need
to find Ezekiel.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.942
Ezekiel?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.143
Ezekiel Jones.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.612
Do you know him?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.780
Announcer:
Welcome back

13:00.780 --> 13:02.715
to the
"I Fell Down!" show

13:02.715 --> 13:05.785
with your host,
Ezekiel Jones!

13:05.785 --> 13:06.954
Thank you! Thank you!

13:06.954 --> 13:07.955
You're too--

13:07.955 --> 13:09.789
( chuckles )
Oops!

13:09.789 --> 13:12.292
I fell down!
( laughs )

13:12.292 --> 13:15.362
Now, our last entry tonight
comes from Tom and Gary.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.630
And let's just hope this one
doesn't... fall flat.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.633
( canned laughter )

13:20.633 --> 13:21.701
Baird:
Delivery for Jones.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.270
I'll take those.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.212
I'm all for a good pratfall,
but an entire show?

13:32.212 --> 13:33.580
This is
the only show.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.582
Are you sure Ezekiel Jones
is a Librarian?

13:35.582 --> 13:38.318
I mean, he's like,
the most famous person
in the whole world!

13:38.318 --> 13:40.921
( laughing )

13:44.191 --> 13:46.293
( laughing subsides )

13:46.293 --> 13:48.061
I think he's better
looking in person.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.196
How are we gonna
get to him

13:49.196 --> 13:51.698
with all these people?

13:51.698 --> 13:53.600
I have an idea.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.536
Tom, how could you do
that to Gary? ( laughs )

13:56.536 --> 13:58.805
Well, that's our show for
tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.440
Make sure you
come back next time

14:00.440 --> 14:01.975
for everybody's
favorite segment,

14:01.975 --> 14:03.576
"Hey! You Startled Me!"

14:03.576 --> 14:05.278
- Good night!
- ( canned applause )

14:05.278 --> 14:06.980
- Director: And cut!
- ( laughter stops abruptly )

14:06.980 --> 14:09.182
- ( bell rings )
- Great work, Ezekiel,
as always.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.151
As always? You know I was
trying something new, right?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.386
Why on Earth would you
want to do something new?

14:13.386 --> 14:14.888
Now, here's your script
for tomorrow's show,

14:14.888 --> 14:16.189
and your itinerary
for the week.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.891
Oh, is it any different
from last week's?

14:17.891 --> 14:18.959
Of course not.

14:18.959 --> 14:19.960
( Cassandra and
Stone giggling )

14:19.960 --> 14:20.994
I can't believe
it's him!

14:20.994 --> 14:22.695
I think you're right,

14:22.695 --> 14:23.863
he is handsomer
in person!

14:23.863 --> 14:25.432
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

14:25.432 --> 14:26.967
Folks, you really
shouldn't be--

14:26.967 --> 14:28.535
Listen, we would like
to submit our audition.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.703
If you leave it
with me, I'll--

14:30.703 --> 14:31.804
No, we want to
audition in person!

14:31.804 --> 14:32.973
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:32.973 --> 14:34.507
We want to make sure
that it's 100%

14:34.507 --> 14:36.043
before we put it
down on camera.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.610
- Right...
- You walk in and it's--

14:37.610 --> 14:38.745
- Oh!
- Oh!

14:38.745 --> 14:40.147
( Cassandra laughs )

14:40.147 --> 14:42.115
Or maybe more classic,
like... ooh, ooh, ooh!

14:42.115 --> 14:44.484
That's fantastic.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.419
Um, unfortunately,
I actually have to go,

14:46.419 --> 14:48.388
but my producer Rachel here can
answer any of your questions.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.790
You guys are
natural fallers.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.092
If you put these
falls on tape--

14:52.092 --> 14:53.726
We want to make sure
that it's perfect.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.362
What about this?
( groans )

14:55.362 --> 14:57.330
Cassandra:
Also, I can go
forward like...

14:57.330 --> 14:58.365
Whoo!

14:58.365 --> 15:00.367
( giggling )

15:06.439 --> 15:09.042
( ticking )

15:11.144 --> 15:12.612
What's your best time?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.247
Oh! Who are you

15:14.247 --> 15:16.016
and how did you
get in here?

15:16.016 --> 15:18.485
The Ezekiel Jones I know
can pick a lock like that
in two seconds.

15:18.485 --> 15:22.222
Yeah, well, I am two seconds
away from calling security.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.557
You don't want to be
a problem now, do you?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.462
You've been
having dreams, right?

15:30.897 --> 15:33.100
What if I told you
those dreams were real?

15:33.100 --> 15:35.735
D-dreams are illegal.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.470
It's a big room,

15:37.470 --> 15:39.072
filled with...

15:39.973 --> 15:41.174
filled with...

15:42.075 --> 15:43.276
Books?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.613
Yes.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.582
Books.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.051
It's a real place.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.252
It's called the...

15:53.953 --> 15:55.655
It's called the...

15:55.655 --> 15:57.324
( sighs )

15:57.324 --> 15:59.092
No, that's missing.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.695
No, what's there
that's missing, too?

16:02.695 --> 16:05.165
Oh, no, no, no.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.666
Kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty...

16:06.666 --> 16:08.135
The Lions!

16:08.135 --> 16:09.969
The Lions are
still there.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.771
I still have it.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.240
It's the Library!

16:13.240 --> 16:16.109
Ezekiel, there is...

16:16.109 --> 16:18.845
a life that is
better than this.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.580
No, better
than this?

16:20.580 --> 16:21.814
No, no, I am the host

16:21.814 --> 16:24.284
of the "I Fell Down!" show.
I want for nothing!

16:24.284 --> 16:27.454
That doesn't mean you
don't want something else.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.489
Ezekiel you've got to come
help me, these people are--

16:29.489 --> 16:30.490
who's this?

16:30.490 --> 16:31.958
Call security!

16:31.958 --> 16:32.959
She's here
to to kidnap me!

16:32.959 --> 16:34.661
Really, Jones?

16:40.867 --> 16:42.001
What's she doing?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.203
I don't know.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.008
We got to get
out of here.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.243
Let's go.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.715
( gasps )

17:07.694 --> 17:09.096
Let me out!

17:10.029 --> 17:11.398
Let me out!

17:14.667 --> 17:16.569
I'm afraid not.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.373
You're in my world now.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.809
And I happily run it.

17:22.809 --> 17:23.943
This little

17:23.943 --> 17:26.613
anti-alternate
reality charm

17:26.613 --> 17:28.181
means I get to
keep my memory

17:28.181 --> 17:30.917
while the rest of
the world goes blind.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.753
And in the land
of the blind,

17:33.753 --> 17:36.055
the one-eyed man
is king.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.590
You're...

17:37.590 --> 17:38.925
the head of
The Company?

17:38.925 --> 17:41.494
I gave you a chance.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.497
You could have lived peacefully
like your friends.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.734
But you had
to be a problem.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.202
Trying to remember.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.904
Remember, remember.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.374
I have to remember.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.611
It's not...

17:58.611 --> 18:01.248
( crying )
I don't...

18:01.248 --> 18:03.082
No, no, no, no, no.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.353
It's all gone.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.854
( breathes deeply )

18:07.854 --> 18:09.756
It's all gone.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.092
You're not going
to like what happens next.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.395
You should
have just forgotten.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.664
Who are you?

18:17.664 --> 18:19.766
( laughs )

18:19.766 --> 18:21.534
Oh.

18:21.534 --> 18:25.138
I see you
already have.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.313
( indistinct conversations )

18:39.386 --> 18:42.422
- ( pops )
- ( gasps, sobs )

18:52.465 --> 18:54.167
Woman:
And then I wondered,

18:54.167 --> 18:57.069
"Who figured out
how to grind flour?

18:57.069 --> 18:58.638
And why?"

18:58.638 --> 19:01.508
And then I found my mind was
chewing on the question for days

19:01.508 --> 19:03.810
and imagining
the possible scenarios...

19:03.810 --> 19:04.844
Stop right there.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.547
I know the lure
of imagination is strong,

19:07.547 --> 19:09.982
but every time
you feel curiosity

19:09.982 --> 19:11.851
sneaking up on you,

19:11.851 --> 19:15.822
just remember, what you
already know is enough.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.690
All:
Remember,

19:17.690 --> 19:20.727
what I already know
is enough.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.662
Remember...

19:25.698 --> 19:28.435
Ezekiel on TV:
Ooh, he took a serious
nose dive there!

19:28.435 --> 19:31.838
And I hope he is rewarded
with some sliders.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.273
- ( Ezekiel laughs )
- ( laughs weakly )

19:33.273 --> 19:34.474
I'm just curious,

19:34.474 --> 19:36.776
aren't you?
What about telephonics?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.110
( yelling )
What about language?

19:38.110 --> 19:39.279
How did that evolve?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.580
Don't you want to know?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.215
What does fruit
taste like?

19:42.215 --> 19:43.750
Don't you
want to know?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.985
Poor woman.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.120
Terminal case of curiosity,
if I ever saw one.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.222
And I should know.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.324
( laughs )
He's funny.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.992
I like him,
in spite of myself.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.727
Hello. You're new.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.329
New,

19:56.329 --> 19:58.130
like you haven't
been here before.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.099
Well, I haven't
been here very long.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.034
Not haven't
been here, but...

20:02.034 --> 20:04.537
haven't been...
here in the gray,

20:04.537 --> 20:06.739
in the paste. There's
too much color to you,
too much bright.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.275
Are you from...

20:08.275 --> 20:09.376
the same words as me?

20:09.376 --> 20:11.143
"The same words"?

20:11.143 --> 20:12.712
Yeah, we define
our world with words.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.681
Chair, couch, TV;
well, those are letters.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.449
But everything
else has a name,

20:16.449 --> 20:17.617
has a purpose,
has a beauty.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.085
Judson had a name,
Jenkins has a name,

20:19.085 --> 20:20.587
Charlene has a name;
those are names

20:20.587 --> 20:22.255
that carry on
in my head.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.456
What's yours?

20:24.724 --> 20:25.725
Eve.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.795
- Eve Baird.
- Eve.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.030
Like the moment
of change in the day.

20:31.030 --> 20:35.668
Eve, I think that you could
really bring some changes here.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.338
I'm Flynn.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.773
Or patient 642,
if you like.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.444
Have we met before?

20:45.845 --> 20:48.080
Not in this place.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.517
And I don't
get out much.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.254
You're nice.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.524
And cute.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.725
And completely crazy.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.859
Well, two out of
three ain't bad.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.794
I like your yellow
and your smile.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.331
And you remind me of something
that I don't want to forget.

21:04.331 --> 21:07.133
Forget...

21:07.133 --> 21:09.469
I have this feeling
there's something
I'm supposed to remember.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.704
but I don't know what
it is, it's all fuzzy.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.905
I remember,
I remember what you don't.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.507
I remember my memory.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.142
They keep trying to take
little pieces of it,

21:16.142 --> 21:19.446
but I have the whole.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.947
And that's what
keeps it alive.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.582
Keeps what alive?

21:24.517 --> 21:25.752
Hold that thought.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.320
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What?

21:27.320 --> 21:30.323
- You're not supposed
to be here,
- Ah!

21:30.323 --> 21:32.258
Eve, if you want to
remember, find me.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.026
You know what
this means, right?

21:34.026 --> 21:36.162
You're gonna have
to go for a reset!

21:36.162 --> 21:38.097
Gentlemen!
Surely

21:38.097 --> 21:39.999
we can negotiate.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.167
Hoo!

21:41.167 --> 21:42.402
Hoo! Hoo!

21:42.402 --> 21:43.670
- ( whooshing )
- Ha-ha!

21:43.670 --> 21:46.272
Hello.
Goodbye.

21:46.272 --> 21:47.807
And extend!

21:47.807 --> 21:50.142
And dance with me!

21:50.142 --> 21:52.779
Ha-ha!

21:52.779 --> 21:53.813
Over here.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.281
Sound okay here?

21:55.281 --> 21:56.282
- In the tush!
- ( groans )

21:56.282 --> 21:58.818
( giggling )

22:01.320 --> 22:03.122
( groans )

22:03.122 --> 22:04.457
Up!

22:05.858 --> 22:07.994
Patient #642!

22:07.994 --> 22:10.830
642!

22:14.734 --> 22:17.169
Be gentle with me,
I'm a delicate soul.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.406
He got
out again?

22:19.406 --> 22:20.740
Do you know how
dangerous it is

22:20.740 --> 22:22.442
for him to be in
the general population,

22:22.442 --> 22:23.810
especially now?

22:23.810 --> 22:25.478
He wouldn't be a problem
if you would allow me

22:25.478 --> 22:27.013
to implement a more
permanent treatment.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.415
Nicole:
No.

22:28.415 --> 22:31.283
He just needs
another reset.

22:31.283 --> 22:32.419
Then everything
will be fine.

22:32.419 --> 22:33.986
Right, Flynn?

22:33.986 --> 22:36.255
You just need
a little help

22:36.255 --> 22:37.657
letting go
of your old reality

22:37.657 --> 22:39.959
and accepting
the new one.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.261
And once you let go,

22:42.261 --> 22:43.630
it will be
gone completely.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.398
Yeah, you don't have
to do this, Nicole.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.133
This is silly.
I'll be good.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.134
I'll be good.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.402
I know you will.

22:49.402 --> 22:50.403
( Velcro rips )

22:50.403 --> 22:53.039
Now... bite down.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.877
( creaking )

23:01.113 --> 23:03.916
- ( electricity buzzing )
- ( babbling )

23:07.319 --> 23:08.755
Well, folks,
I better wrap things up

23:08.755 --> 23:10.890
before I slip up.
( laughs )

23:10.890 --> 23:12.492
Good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.561
- Director: And cut.
- ( bell rings )

23:15.995 --> 23:17.664
What are they
doing here?

23:17.664 --> 23:19.265
We don't need them.
They already took the lady away.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.901
They just want to make sure
nothing else will happen.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.402
What did she want
with you anyway?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.104
Nothing.
It was just nonsense.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.439
What did she say?

23:28.140 --> 23:30.142
If she said anything
suspicious to you,

23:30.142 --> 23:31.210
you should tell them.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.779
Because as long as
they are here,

23:32.779 --> 23:34.113
they're disrupting
the show.

23:34.113 --> 23:38.518
And The Company needs
the show to run smoothly.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.820
Even if that means
getting a new host.

24:00.406 --> 24:01.407
- Hi there!
- ( yells )

24:01.407 --> 24:02.742
What are you
doing here?

24:02.742 --> 24:05.111
- Kidnapping you.
- ( car door opens )

24:05.111 --> 24:06.579
Company Men are just
behind that door.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.880
All I have to do
is scream.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.381
Yeah, but you're
not going to.

24:09.381 --> 24:10.717
'Cause they might
start wondering why

24:10.717 --> 24:12.585
you're attracting
so much attention.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.686
If they haven't already.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.822
I can't go
with you, okay?

24:15.822 --> 24:17.456
I have a great life
and I don't want to ruin it!

24:17.456 --> 24:18.591
Don't you guys
have your own lives?

24:18.591 --> 24:20.893
Ever since
I went with Baird,

24:20.893 --> 24:23.996
I'm starting to think this life
is less and less real.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.431
Come on, man, you really
want The Company

24:25.431 --> 24:27.066
watching you so closely?

24:27.066 --> 24:30.002
Your life can't possibly be
as good as you pretend it is.

24:30.002 --> 24:33.139
( laughs )
And how could you be
so sure, Cassandra?

24:35.207 --> 24:36.442
Because I know you.

24:36.442 --> 24:37.644
I can feel it.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.546
Because you know me, too.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.480
And...

24:41.480 --> 24:43.516
because I didn't
tell you my name.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.821
All right, what do you
want me to do?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.690
Help us rescue Baird.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.903
( elevator bell dinging )

25:09.709 --> 25:11.744
Sub-basement six.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.291
Hello?

25:26.559 --> 25:28.060
Flynn?

26:05.397 --> 26:06.398
Baird:
What is this?

26:06.398 --> 26:07.566
A sword.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.801
And a myth.
A sword myth.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.002
Hey, it's you,
the new one.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.904
I saw them drag
you down here.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.239
Yes, they do that.

26:13.239 --> 26:16.342
200 milliamperes
right into my noggin!

26:16.342 --> 26:18.544
But, fortunately, I knew
that they wanted my dreams,

26:18.544 --> 26:20.379
so I fortified myself,

26:20.379 --> 26:21.648
and built up

26:21.648 --> 26:23.082
a resistance.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.751
My dreams aren't gone,
just rearranged.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.986
Do you like my friend?

26:26.986 --> 26:28.154
- Your friend the sword?
- My friend the sword!

26:28.154 --> 26:29.622
He taught me how to
parry and thrust!

26:29.622 --> 26:31.290
These are all
my friends and family.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.859
I feel like...

26:32.859 --> 26:34.761
- I've been here.
- You have. And you haven't.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.962
It's very confusing

26:35.962 --> 26:37.329
when you jump
the parallel.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.265
How could you draw me
if we've never met?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.701
The answer to that is
in the question, Eve Baird.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.738
We know each other.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.774
We've been
in this place

26:47.774 --> 26:49.275
with the books,
together.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.343
That's where I go
in my dreams.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.214
It's really nice...

26:55.214 --> 26:56.215
in the Library.

26:56.215 --> 26:59.251
The Library.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.687
Both:
Yes!

27:00.687 --> 27:03.255
She tries to
take it from me,

27:03.255 --> 27:06.025
but I fight it, so I put
everything down here

27:06.025 --> 27:07.860
in case she ever was
able to cleave it out.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.361
Somebody else can find it
and they can build it.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.663
Do you want to see
my favorite one?

27:10.663 --> 27:12.131
- Yeah.
- This one here.

27:12.131 --> 27:16.202
They look like
they're... bursting.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.205
I've never
felt that way.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.206
Until I saw you.

27:23.575 --> 27:24.777
You're nice.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.416
And cute.

27:30.416 --> 27:31.951
And completely crazy.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.133
( gasps )
Flynn!

27:47.133 --> 27:49.802
- It's you.
- Eve, you found me.

27:49.802 --> 27:50.803
I knew that
you would.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.538
I missed you.

27:52.538 --> 27:53.605
You left.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.407
I didn't mean to.

27:55.407 --> 27:58.878
And I'm never leaving you
or the Library again.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.049
( door opens )

28:11.958 --> 28:15.527
I have been very
patient with you, Flynn.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.731
I've been kind enough
to let you live, Baird.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.768
And... this is how
you repay me?

28:21.768 --> 28:23.402
By trusting
our own memories?

28:23.402 --> 28:24.570
Getting our minds back?

28:24.570 --> 28:26.739
Your mind is not back.

28:26.739 --> 28:29.909
It simply wasn't
zapped hard enough.

28:29.909 --> 28:33.612
No amount of zapping
is gonna make us forget, Nicole.

28:33.612 --> 28:36.048
When I first met you,
you introduced me to the Library

28:36.048 --> 28:38.017
and it opened up
continents for me,

28:38.017 --> 28:40.052
as it does
for anybody, everybody,

28:40.052 --> 28:41.487
whether they
know it or not.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.823
I'm sorry that you feel
like it betrayed you,

28:43.823 --> 28:45.491
but the world
needs a Library, Nicole.

28:46.993 --> 28:51.097
No, the world doesn't
need the Library.

28:51.097 --> 28:54.200
Which is good, because
the world will never have it.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.302
Doctor.

28:56.302 --> 28:59.171
Does #642 need
to be reset again?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.907
No.

29:00.907 --> 29:04.110
Remember, that permanent
procedure you mentioned?

29:04.110 --> 29:06.345
- Do it.
- ( gasps )

29:06.345 --> 29:07.479
To both of them.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.316
Uh, uh...

29:20.492 --> 29:23.729
All right, there's like
a half a dozen guards here.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.197
So how do we get in?

29:25.197 --> 29:26.132
I don't know!

29:26.132 --> 29:27.867
It's not like
I've done this before.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.569
Actually, I have a feeling
that we have done this before.

29:30.569 --> 29:33.539
The three of us,
together.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.507
So how do
we do it?

29:35.507 --> 29:36.508
I remem...

29:38.710 --> 29:41.047
I remember you know
things about architecture.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.681
Oh, that's right,
you do!

29:42.681 --> 29:44.116
- Right?
- Yeah.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.751
But how exactly is that
gonna help us get in?

29:45.751 --> 29:47.219
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

29:50.289 --> 29:54.126
Judging by the foundation
of this building,

29:54.126 --> 29:57.363
it was built in the middle
of the last century.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.599
Which means the utility
rooms were built

30:00.599 --> 30:02.902
on the side of the building,
instead of the middle.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.237
We go around that corner,
through the door,
I guarantee you

30:05.237 --> 30:07.473
it's a utility room.
We go through the utility room,

30:07.473 --> 30:09.842
less chance for guards
being on the other side.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.277
That's great.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.478
How do we deal with
the guards on this side?

30:12.478 --> 30:13.745
- You!
- Me?

30:13.745 --> 30:15.214
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.815
You do this thing with
numbers and your hands,

30:16.815 --> 30:18.784
- and you figure stuff out.
- Oh, with the-- that's you!

30:18.784 --> 30:21.520
- With my hands?
- Yeah.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.757
Holy moly.

30:25.757 --> 30:26.758
Stone:
What?

30:26.758 --> 30:28.427
What do you see?

30:28.427 --> 30:30.462
Everything.

30:30.462 --> 30:36.468
Connections, numerals,
angles, physics.

30:36.468 --> 30:40.139
Timing.

30:42.041 --> 30:45.811
The average male walking
stride length is 30 inches,

30:45.811 --> 30:49.648
Average pace:
3.1 miles per hour.

30:49.648 --> 30:52.384
The pivot ratio
is 270 degrees,

30:52.384 --> 30:57.223
and this building has
a footprint of 1,596
square feet.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.158
( footsteps departing
in distance )

31:02.494 --> 31:04.796
Which means we have 43 seconds
until they come back around.

31:04.796 --> 31:05.998
Come on!

31:10.402 --> 31:12.538
Some sort
of alarm system.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.106
Looks like I'm up.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.782
Stone:
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

31:23.782 --> 31:25.617
Not a single clue.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.686
( electricity crackles,
latch opens )

31:27.686 --> 31:29.088
Oh.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.856
( scoffs )
I'm good.

31:30.856 --> 31:31.958
You're definitely
something.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.159
Go.

31:38.464 --> 31:41.133
Stone,
what are you doing?

31:42.601 --> 31:45.637
Just-- it doesn't feel...
( grunts )

31:47.039 --> 31:48.240
What?

31:50.676 --> 31:52.211
- ( gun cocks )
- Hold it right there!

31:52.211 --> 31:53.579
Identify yourselves.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.151
All:
We're the Librarians.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.621
Of course. Carry on.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.861
Okay, why did
that work?

32:09.861 --> 32:11.230
Cassandra and Stone:
I have no idea.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.165
Hey, guys, what's this
permanent treatment?

32:13.165 --> 32:15.467
- A girl could really use
some advanced warning.
- Don't worry.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.169
They don't drill holes
in your skull anymore.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.671
They do it through
the eye socket instead.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.173
- Doc?
- That's right.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.841
The, um, eye socket

32:22.841 --> 32:24.076
is easier.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.377
Uh, I can
take over from here.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.013
- You guys can go.
- Go?

32:27.013 --> 32:28.514
- What are you--
- ( orderlies grunt )

32:28.514 --> 32:31.217
Cassandra!
Stone! Ezekiel!

32:31.217 --> 32:33.352
Come on, let's get
out of here.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.620
Okay.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.423
Wait, there's someone
I want you to meet first.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.298
Oh, Flynn.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.401
I'm so sorry this
had to happen to you.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.503
I really am.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.843
( grunting )

32:57.843 --> 33:00.112
Let's go.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.180
Don't just stand there.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.448
Go after them!

33:03.315 --> 33:06.952
( alarm blaring )

33:06.952 --> 33:08.854
( patients clamoring )

33:08.854 --> 33:10.556
No! Retreat!

33:10.556 --> 33:12.524
Ah!

33:12.524 --> 33:14.126
Back, back, back,
back, back...

33:14.126 --> 33:15.527
Go! Ah!

33:15.527 --> 33:16.695
Go through here!

33:19.198 --> 33:21.433
( clamoring )

33:24.236 --> 33:25.437
Stone:
Go!

33:29.275 --> 33:31.377
- There!
- ( electricity crackles )

33:31.377 --> 33:33.179
This is not gonna
hold forever!

33:33.179 --> 33:34.380
All right, let's get
out of here then.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.014
Gah!

33:39.085 --> 33:40.086
We're trapped.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.554
Yeah.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.528
There's no way out!

33:49.528 --> 33:52.064
All right, there's not
a moment to lose.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.299
We have to manifest
the Library.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.267
Here? In the
insane asylum?

33:55.267 --> 33:57.236
What better place than
where the curious end up?

33:57.236 --> 33:59.371
We are the Library!

33:59.371 --> 34:01.840
It lives and breathes inside
of each and every one of us.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.410
Stone, it lives inside of you
because of your love

34:04.410 --> 34:09.148
of art and history
and architecture.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.119
( clamoring dies down )

34:13.119 --> 34:14.686
Cassandra,

34:14.686 --> 34:15.887
it lives inside of you

34:15.887 --> 34:18.124
because of your love
of science

34:18.124 --> 34:21.660
and math
and magic.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.265
Ezekiel,
you're a thief.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.066
Wait, that's it?

34:28.066 --> 34:31.170
That's it. You are a thief,
and the Library needs you

34:31.170 --> 34:34.773
because you know
the value of an artifact.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.508
You know how
to find it,

34:36.508 --> 34:38.144
and you don't let
anyone get in your way,

34:38.144 --> 34:39.578
not even me.

34:40.612 --> 34:41.780
Out of my way!

34:43.149 --> 34:45.050
You can't.

34:45.050 --> 34:47.419
I won't let you.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.520
Flynn,

34:48.520 --> 34:51.323
you are the heart
and the soul of the Library.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.692
You've walked
every inch of it,
every room.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.495
You stand ready
to guard against evil,

34:56.495 --> 34:58.330
ready to defend
the place you love

34:58.330 --> 35:00.832
with your last breath.

35:00.832 --> 35:03.635
( Baird panting )

35:04.803 --> 35:06.472
Kitty, kitty.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.106
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.810
We don't
have to go home.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.182
We're already there.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.086
I'm sorry!

35:21.086 --> 35:22.988
No. No.

35:22.988 --> 35:24.256
No!

35:29.094 --> 35:30.296
The Library.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.098
It's back.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.200
Stone:
We're back!

35:34.200 --> 35:36.735
Books!
The Lions!

35:36.735 --> 35:39.605
Ah! The jewels!

35:39.605 --> 35:41.540
When we manifested
the Library,

35:41.540 --> 35:43.409
that reality
disappeared.

35:43.409 --> 35:47.613
This is-- this--
it's all back to normal!

35:47.613 --> 35:48.847
Mr. Jenkins!

35:50.916 --> 35:52.751
Jenkins...

35:52.751 --> 35:54.686
Not everything's
back to normal.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.690
Some things
can't be fixed.

36:00.392 --> 36:03.229
There's one more thing
that I need to do.

36:05.264 --> 36:06.532
Baird:
What is it?

36:08.634 --> 36:09.901
This is the Book
of Nicole's life.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.470
Everything that she's
ever done is in here,

36:11.470 --> 36:13.705
including when she went
back in time 500 years.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.741
You want to
rewrite history?

36:15.741 --> 36:17.509
- You said it's too risky.
- I know.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.678
But we are going to totally
ignore all of that advice.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.613
All we need to do
to make that happen...

36:21.613 --> 36:23.715
the Toaster
of Albuquerque.

36:23.715 --> 36:26.852
The Toaster? But Jenkins never
figured out what it really does,

36:26.852 --> 36:28.554
other than burn down
national forests.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.155
Jenkins may not have,
but I did.

36:30.155 --> 36:33.459
It's a portal,
except it doesn't
lock on to time in place,

36:33.459 --> 36:35.261
it locks on to a person,
but not for very long,

36:35.261 --> 36:37.363
so we need to find where
Nicole is in history.

36:37.363 --> 36:40.332
before time
makes her dark.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.968
( beeping, static )

36:42.968 --> 36:44.169
- That's it.
- Flynn?

36:44.169 --> 36:45.737
That's the exact moment

36:45.737 --> 36:47.606
- that Nicole
went back in time.
- Flynn?

36:47.606 --> 36:50.075
- Flynn!
- Nicole! Nicole!

36:50.075 --> 36:51.176
- Anybody?
- No, no, no

36:51.176 --> 36:52.644
no, no, no.
Can't, lose it.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.247
Look,
according to this book,

36:55.247 --> 36:56.748
that's when
she became immortal.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.458
Nicole, no!

37:06.458 --> 37:07.659
I have to get to her

37:07.659 --> 37:08.794
before the connection
fades out.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.496
I'll hold down
the dial. Go.

37:16.535 --> 37:17.436
Flynn?

37:17.436 --> 37:19.605
Flynn, is that
really you?

37:19.605 --> 37:20.839
Oh.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.041
I almost made
a horrible mistake.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.277
But I knew
in my heart...

37:25.277 --> 37:27.579
you would always
come back for me.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.451
That's not
why I came.

37:33.685 --> 37:34.586
What?

37:34.586 --> 37:36.488
I'm came to
right a wrong.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.490
I never came back
for you the first time.

37:38.490 --> 37:42.294
I couldn't,
I was too consumed
with guilt and grief.

37:42.294 --> 37:45.030
And I can't take you
back with me now.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.066
Flynn, you'll
have to hurry.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.735
I'm sorry,
this isn't gonna hold!

37:49.735 --> 37:50.836
Who is that?

37:50.836 --> 37:52.203
My Guardian.

37:52.203 --> 37:54.105
- Your Guardian?
- Yeah.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.007
Flynn, what's going on?

37:56.007 --> 37:57.609
You look older.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.412
I know what you were
just about to do.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.748
And I know why you
were going to do it.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.282
And we still need
you to do it.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.784
Except, this time,
for the right reason.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.420
You are gonna have
an amazing life.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.821
And a surprisingly
long one,

38:09.821 --> 38:12.391
full of adventure
and loss

38:12.391 --> 38:13.759
and triumph and it's
all in this book.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.327
And you have to do everything
that's in this book

38:15.327 --> 38:16.328
to fulfill
the prophecy,

38:16.328 --> 38:19.331
only this time...

38:19.331 --> 38:21.367
do it for the Library,

38:21.367 --> 38:22.568
not against it.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.741
I always thought
I was your Guardian.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.213
Now, I know...

38:35.213 --> 38:37.416
I'm the Library's
Guardian.

38:39.184 --> 38:40.486
Baird:
Flynn!

38:40.486 --> 38:43.088
( beeping, static )

38:46.157 --> 38:48.059
Goodbye, Nicole.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.361
Flynn?

38:49.361 --> 38:51.930
See you in 500 years.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.077
( snoring )

39:06.077 --> 39:07.513
Mm, five more minutes.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.783
Ow!

39:11.783 --> 39:13.051
( gasps )

39:17.155 --> 39:18.890
Wait.

39:18.890 --> 39:19.858
We're back!

39:19.858 --> 39:22.461
We're back where
it all started!

39:25.196 --> 39:28.066
Hey! Guys!

39:28.066 --> 39:30.936
We're back to the Tethering
Ceremony Rehearsal Day!

39:30.936 --> 39:32.070
Isn't that great?

39:32.070 --> 39:33.672
Sure, man.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.874
You don't remember.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.843
It's just me.

39:37.843 --> 39:38.677
Okay.

39:38.677 --> 39:41.046
Uh, where in
time are you?

39:41.046 --> 39:44.115
The ultimate battle
between good and evil.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.316
Happened ages ago.

39:45.316 --> 39:46.552
Well, weeks, at most.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.219
Which is ages
in today's culture.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.590
- Or don't you have
a Twitter feed?
- And the cornerstones?

39:51.590 --> 39:54.259
The four cornerstones of
the Library of Alexandria,
where are they?

39:54.259 --> 39:55.961
Here, in the Library,

39:55.961 --> 39:58.029
where they've
always been.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.698
Then Nicole did it.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.299
She rewrote history.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.669
Did Cal hit you in
the head too hard last time

40:03.669 --> 40:05.170
your guys were sparring?

40:05.170 --> 40:06.171
Easy!

40:08.106 --> 40:10.175
He's just catching up.

40:12.310 --> 40:13.545
Eve.

40:13.545 --> 40:16.347
You're more beautiful
than I remember,

40:16.347 --> 40:17.816
and I have an
excellent memory.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.886
I think my memory
can match yours.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.890
Jenkins:
I apologize for
my tardiness.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.458
You'd think,
at some point in history,

40:26.458 --> 40:27.759
some Librarian
would have alphabetized

40:27.759 --> 40:29.294
our miscellaneous
collection,

40:29.294 --> 40:30.896
but no, so...

40:30.896 --> 40:32.397
- Baird and Flynn: Jenkins!
- Oh!

40:32.397 --> 40:33.532
Uh...
( chuckles )

40:33.532 --> 40:36.234
Immortal Jenkins.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.335
Immortal Jenkins?

40:37.335 --> 40:39.538
Yes, last time
I checked, sir.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.106
What's wrong?
Are you guys okay?

40:41.106 --> 40:42.708
Never better.

40:42.708 --> 40:45.110
You have on idea how
good it is to see you.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.277
Well...
( chuckles )

40:46.277 --> 40:48.213
Colonel, I appreciate
your appreciation, yes?

40:48.213 --> 40:50.882
But, please, we really
should rehearse.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.017
( stammers )

40:52.017 --> 40:53.952
You know what?
Enough with the rehearsal.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.053
Let's tether.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.923
Sir, it isn't
the equinox.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.290
We always tether
at the equinox.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.391
That's how it
was written,

41:00.391 --> 41:02.794
that's how it
has always been.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.329
Jenkins, just 'cause the thing
has always been done a way,

41:04.329 --> 41:06.665
doesn't mean it has to
be done that way now,

41:06.665 --> 41:09.300
especially when
all parties agree.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.537
Eve...

41:11.537 --> 41:13.939
do you want to tether
to the Library with me?

41:13.939 --> 41:15.907
I do.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.544
Do you want to tether
to the Library with me?

41:18.544 --> 41:20.946
I don't have
a doubt in my mind.

41:20.946 --> 41:25.016
Library, do you want Eve
and I to tether to you?

41:25.016 --> 41:26.585
- ( electricity crackles )
- ( Cassandra yelps )

41:26.585 --> 41:27.653
( laughs )

41:27.653 --> 41:28.654
I'll take that
as a yes.

41:28.654 --> 41:29.955
How about you guys?

41:29.955 --> 41:31.923
- I'm in.
- Yeah, as long as it means

41:31.923 --> 41:33.458
- we don't have to
practice anymore, yeah.
- Yeah.

41:33.458 --> 41:34.993
Oh, this is so exciting!

41:36.895 --> 41:39.030
Fine, sir!
Yeah, fine.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.832
And if you get hand-fasted
to some post office somewhere,

41:40.832 --> 41:43.001
please don't
blame me.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.136
But, if that's
what you wish.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.005
So...

41:47.005 --> 41:49.140
Librarians,

41:49.140 --> 41:50.441
Guardian,

41:50.441 --> 41:51.910
artifacts,

41:51.910 --> 41:54.379
we are gathered here
today to witness

41:54.379 --> 41:57.248
the eternal tethering...

41:57.248 --> 41:59.350
of this Librarian

41:59.350 --> 42:01.352
and this Guardian...

42:01.352 --> 42:04.222
in a ceremony handed
down through the ages.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.658
Flynn Carsen,

42:06.658 --> 42:09.094
Eve Baird...

42:14.800 --> 42:17.235
( music playing )
