at home?
That would be nice too.

- What is that?
- "A single brick salvaged

02:43.705 --> 02:46.833

residence of Edgar Allan Poe"?

by a horror writer?

I have to have that.
- Early anniversary present?

02:51.254 --> 02:53.506
- [exclaims] That is so mine.
- It's gonna be yours, baby.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.924

you were coming.

And it's great that you guys--
um, how are you?

03:09.689 --> 03:12.984
- You know what?
We are awesome.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.363
- Yeah, and we have Nathan
to thank because he set us up.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.781
- Yeah.
- Oh, I--no, I didn't.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.449
I--I definitely didn't
set you up.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.826
- No, no, you did.
You did, remember?

03:21.868 --> 03:22.911
I--I said he was hot,

03:22.952 --> 03:25.747
and then you said
he was good people.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.165
- Buddy, thanks.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.750
I owe you.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.543
- Good people?
[laughs drily]

03:31.920 --> 03:33.880
- Oop, excuse me.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.965
Thank you so much.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.385
Oh, my God,
these canapes are amazing.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.136

I've had, like, 17 of them.

[light ambient music]

03:44.599 --> 03:47.185
Uh... [scoffs]
Carlos is here.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.062
- Mm, mm-hmm.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.022
Yeah.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.732
- You invited Carlos?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.818
- Yes.
I want all my friends here.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.319
- Oh, my God.
You invite him to, like,

03:56.361 --> 03:58.405
socialize too?

03:58.446 --> 04:00.031
- Well, this is the first one,

04:00.073 --> 04:01.408
but Simon doesn't care.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.784
- Hey.
- See?

04:02.826 --> 04:03.785
All good.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.537
- You guys are
so fucking weird.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.914
[indistinct chatter]

04:07.956 --> 04:09.416
Hey, guys.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.419
Bring it in.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.254
Look at these new numbers.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.589
15 million downloads.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.133
- That's a lot
of fuckin' money.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.551
- Yeah, that's a lot
of money.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.427
- Like, a million dollars.
- Can you believe that?

04:20.468 --> 04:21.761
Can you believe that?

04:21.803 --> 04:24.097
- Yeah, but you know
what the next question is?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.515
How do we make it bigger?

04:25.557 --> 04:27.267
- Okay, let's just enjoy
this moment.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.601
- We gotta push it.
Look.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.395
I went on a bit
of a deep dive on Reddit.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.897
Okay, 24% of our fans,

04:32.939 --> 04:35.108
they want me to keep talking
about my greatest hits

04:35.150 --> 04:37.610
over and over
like I'm Billy fucking Joel,

04:37.652 --> 04:40.530
but 76%, guess what they want?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.449
- Don't say it.
- Fresh new content,

04:42.490 --> 04:43.450
motherfuckers.
both: No.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.784
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.827
- We're not talking
about that anymore.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.120
- They said it.
- Faking it worked

04:47.162 --> 04:48.413
pretty good in Vegas.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.330
- The fake was great.
It was great.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.665
It was a one-time thing.

04:50.707 --> 04:51.624
- How 'bout a two-time thing?
- It was great.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.584
- Why?
- No, we've gotten listen

04:52.625 --> 04:54.753
to our 15-million fanbase,

04:54.794 --> 04:56.296
and we gotta keep it real
for them.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.672
- Okay, listen to this.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.091
Spotify is talking about
a $20-million deal with us.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.551
- Yeah.
- So how 'bout that's keeping

05:01.593 --> 05:03.928
shit real, bro?
- That's keeping it real real,

05:03.970 --> 05:05.638
so just keep your shit
together,

05:05.680 --> 05:08.058
don't fuck it up,
and just keep cool.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.392

Come here. Come here.

Come here, boy,
you handsome boy.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.582
Ooh. [laughing]
Oh, good catch.

Oh, Duke is such
a handsome boy.

Come here.
- Hey.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.088
Do you wanna try
this edible flower?

06:20.130 --> 06:22.882
- Do you think
we could get the dog back?

06:22.924 --> 06:24.718
- Uh, sorry, what?
[laughs]

06:24.759 --> 06:26.094
Are you kidding?
- I just--I...

06:26.136 --> 06:28.096
- [laughing]
- I'm really feeling like

06:28.138 --> 06:29.514
he wants to come home.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.017
- Okay, babe.
We gave them the dog.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.060
You can't ask for something
like that back.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.603
That's insane.
- We gave him the dog

06:35.645 --> 06:37.272
because our yard was too small.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.273
- Yes.
- But that's about

06:38.314 --> 06:39.274
to fucking change.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.650
We're gonna have a huge yard.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.110
He should come home.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.486
I mean, look--
look at the way he's--

06:43.528 --> 06:45.363
he throws the ball
like such a pussy.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.823
He's like--
- Anybody see that?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.700
- It is kind of a lame throw.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.452
- Right? Just like--
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean

06:50.493 --> 06:51.619
you can steal the dog back.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.663
- Good catch, Duke!

06:53.705 --> 06:54.789
- His name is McEnroe.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.624
It's not Duke, and he knows it.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.209
- You gotta let it go, okay?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.461
We can't ask for the dog back.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.297
- Okay, fine.
We'll buy him back.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.674
- [sighs] You know how much
Simon loves this dog?

07:04.716 --> 07:06.551
He does. He's obsessed.
- [laughs]

07:06.593 --> 07:08.470
- He sleeps in the guesthouse
with him.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.013
- Do you think I give a shit?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.099
Hey, pal.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.102
It's us.
He's look--he's looking at--

07:16.144 --> 07:17.479
- Babe, he's not looking at us.
- He's looking at us.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.272
- No, he's not.
You can't take something

07:19.314 --> 07:20.273
like that away.
- Hey.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.316
- That's--that's nuts.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.442
- Yeah, um, can I--

07:22.484 --> 07:23.610
can I grab you for a second?
I just--

07:23.651 --> 07:24.819
- Yeah.
- I need a hand.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.697
- Yes. Please don't
steal the dog, okay?

07:27.739 --> 07:29.407
- Come here, Duke.
Come to me. Come to me.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.950
Oh, come here. Good catch.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.453
Good boy.
Come here. Come here.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.038
Okay, Duke.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.373
Go get it.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.458
Oh, good catch.
You're such a handsome boy.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.709
Bring it back. Bring it back.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.890
- Just love this room!

07:53.932 --> 07:55.850
It's so beautiful.
Where are the party favors?

07:55.892 --> 07:57.435
You hiding them up here?
- Ava--

07:57.477 --> 07:58.853
- Also, you have no pictures.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.356
It's really weird.
- Hey, are you okay?

08:01.398 --> 08:03.525
- What?

08:03.566 --> 08:06.736
[curious music]

08:06.778 --> 08:08.113
What--what is that?

08:08.154 --> 08:09.989
[laughs]
- I don't know. You tell me.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.033
I saw it fall out
of your pocket at CrimeCon.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.286
- I've--I've never seen that
before in my life.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.705
- You've never seen this before
in your life?

08:16.746 --> 08:17.831
- No.
- Ever?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.374
- No.
- Okay.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.752
"WTF? You killed Dahlia?

08:22.794 --> 08:24.254

08:24.295 --> 08:27.132
Meet us outside
in the corridor now."

08:28.842 --> 08:31.177
You're "Based on a True Story,"
aren't you?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.262
- The--
[laughs]

08:32.303 --> 08:35.015
"Based on a"--
the--the--the podcast?

08:35.056 --> 08:36.725
- Ava, I-I just--
I wanna help you.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.851
Are you in danger?
- No.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.644
- Because I--I called
the number

08:39.686 --> 08:40.770
on this phone,
and Matt answered.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.023
- I don't--no. What?

08:43.064 --> 08:45.400
- He's the Westside
fucking Ripper, isn't he?

08:45.442 --> 08:46.901
What is going on?

08:46.943 --> 08:48.361
- Okay--
- Why--why are you doing this?

08:48.403 --> 08:49.779
Is--is he threatening you...
- It's not what you think.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.072
- Or Nathan?
- Oh, my God, no.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.324
It's not--
it's not like that at all.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.243
- No? Then what is it?
Because it says right here

08:55.285 --> 08:56.911
that he killed
that girl in Vegas.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.747
- Okay, is that why
you invited Matt tonight?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.040
So you could ask me about this?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.750
- I mean, I invited him
to find out

09:01.791 --> 09:03.418
if he's the guy so I--
so I could help you,

09:03.460 --> 09:05.170
but if you don't want my help,
I'll just go to the cops with--

09:05.211 --> 09:06.629
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.798
There's no--we don't need to--
let's just all calm down.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.258
No cops.
You don't need to call anybody.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.427
Oh, fuck. Okay.
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.054
Okay?
- Okay.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.723
- Nathan and I are broke.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.850
We--we were gonna lose
the house.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.310
- What?
- I know, and Matt was over,

09:20.352 --> 09:21.936
and we started talking,
and it turns out

09:21.978 --> 09:25.106
he's a--he's this, like,
crime fanatic junkie like us.

09:25.148 --> 09:29.486
So the three of us decided
to make a fake podcast

09:29.527 --> 09:33.323
where Matt pretends
to be the Westside Ripper.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.121
- So Matt is pretending
to be a serial killer?

09:40.163 --> 09:41.498
- I know.
When you say it like that,

09:41.539 --> 09:42.624
it sounds really bad, but--

09:42.665 --> 09:45.251
it-it's so bad and--
and fucked up.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.253
I know it sounds like that,
but we were desperate,

09:47.295 --> 09:49.255
desperate,
completely desperate, and--

09:49.297 --> 09:51.466
and then Matt, like,
he got, like, really into it,

09:51.508 --> 09:53.218
and he pretended he was the guy

09:53.259 --> 09:54.761
that pushed that girl
off the roof.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.137
And people got obsessed.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.431
They couldn't get enough of it.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.601
- So you're saying
that all of this is--is fake

10:01.643 --> 10:02.811
and that guy's just a plumber?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.896
- Yes!
- Because this looks

10:04.938 --> 10:06.523
pretty fucking real to me.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.732
- Well, good.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.276
We--[laughs]
We got you.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.361
That's good.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.570
That--
[splutters]

10:12.612 --> 10:14.322
Come on.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.449
Do you think
that I would be in business

10:16.491 --> 10:18.993
with a real serial killer?

10:19.035 --> 10:21.996
I mean, you sound insane.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.666
That would be the biggest
fucking stupidest thing

10:24.708 --> 10:26.334
I could do, right?

10:26.376 --> 10:28.086
Right?

10:29.713 --> 10:30.839
- Yeah.
- Right.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.173
Please don't tell anybody.

10:32.215 --> 10:35.427
Truly, like, I--
I literally dragged Nathan

10:35.468 --> 10:36.886
into this shit show.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.388
There's a baby coming.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.141
Our lives could be over.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.392
Please.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.770
- Okay.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.772
Okay.
Yeah, no, no, no. I--I--

10:47.814 --> 10:48.857
I won't say a word.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.692
- [sighs] Thank you.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.111
Thank you.
- Wow. [laughs]

10:53.153 --> 10:56.197
I got to admit, this is--
this is kind of genius.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.742
"Based on a True Story"
is based on a fake story.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.827
- I know.
- I-I wish I'd thought of it.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.413
- Yeah. Well, yeah.
Well, yeah. Mm-hmm.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.748
Thank you.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.334
[sighs]
- I got your back.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.545
- Thank you. Okay. Okay.

Thank you.

- Yeah, I'm going
to UCLA Law in the fall.

- Awesome.

- "Crushed those midterms"?

I tried to put an ad

14:18.525 --> 14:21.820

"Based on a True Story."

14:21.861 --> 14:23.029
- Hot.
- Brilliant.

- Such a hot show.

- Right?

14:26.282 --> 14:27.742
- Yeah.
- Amazing.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.327
- Brilliant.
- Yeah.

- I love that.
- Oh, my gosh, it gets me hot.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.330
- So brilliant.
- It's so good.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.665
- I think it's fake.
- Oh, yeah?

14:33.707 --> 14:36.418
- Yeah, like, the, um--
the Orson Welles thing?

14:36.459 --> 14:37.585
- Uh, "War of the Worlds"?

14:37.627 --> 14:39.671
- It could be just
street theater.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.798
- Absolutely not.
Are you kidding me?

14:41.840 --> 14:43.133
You heard this guy's voice?

14:43.174 --> 14:44.759
That's a stabby voice.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.178
- What?
- I buy it 100%.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.847
That guy is the killer.
- Mm.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.307
- You should just ask them.
- There's no chance.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.852
- [gasps] Yeah.
- You never talk to anybody.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.145
- Oh.
- No, you--

14:55.186 --> 14:57.230
you email a shell corporation.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.773
You pay them in crypto.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.444
Nobody knows where they are
or who they are.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.988
- Wow.
- I wouldn't pay them a cent.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.866
Paul, the guy
is killing people.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.659
- Okay, Richard.

15:09.701 --> 15:13.496
Last time I checked, there is
still free speech in America.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.790
- Okay, even if that speech
is about

15:15.832 --> 15:17.292
how you just killed someone?

15:17.334 --> 15:18.626
- Yeah, especially then.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.129
You--you wanna outlaw
offensive speech?

what goes on the list?

15:22.881 --> 15:24.382

15:24.424 --> 15:26.176
- I listen to it, and I think

15:26.217 --> 15:28.178
it's totally
fucking disgusting.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.888
I think that you're right.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.514
I think that it's all true.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.141
I think he's a serial killer.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.018
And I think the people
that are helping him

15:35.060 --> 15:36.644
are far worse than he is.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.563
- Oh. What people?
- Preach, sister.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.856
- There's an interviewer.
- Hm?

15:39.898 --> 15:41.399
- Don't say that.
- Right? I mean, somebody...

15:41.441 --> 15:42.817
- No, that's not your word.
- Has to be helping him.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.823
but these parasites are
making money off of him.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.825
They should go to prison
longer than he does.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.078
- [coughs]
- That's a very good point.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.371
No, they really should.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.247
Think about it.
- Mm.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.625
- I don't know. I--

15:58.667 --> 16:00.835
there's nothing wrong
with makin' money.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.046
I love money. You love money.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.589
You love money.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.049
Money's great.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.384
Puts food on the table,

16:07.425 --> 16:09.386
puts our kids through school.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.513
Carlos loves money.
Right?

16:11.554 --> 16:12.806
- What?

16:12.847 --> 16:15.058
- Can't open your gym
on the East Coast

16:15.100 --> 16:17.310
without money, right?

16:17.352 --> 16:19.562
- Uh, it certainly
would help, yeah.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.524
- Mm, guys, I think it's time

16:22.565 --> 16:24.734
to start bidding
on the items, right?

16:24.776 --> 16:26.986
- I just wanna say
I love Carlos' business plan.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.322
- Oh, my God.
- And I--

16:29.364 --> 16:30.740
I want to invest in it.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.743
- Wait, you--you want
to invest in my gym?

16:33.785 --> 16:37.914
- Yeah, I want to finance
the whole thing by myself.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.207
[unsettling music]

16:39.249 --> 16:40.417
- Well, that's--
- [laughs]

16:40.458 --> 16:41.668
Wait, are you serious?

16:41.710 --> 16:42.919
- 100%.

16:42.961 --> 16:43.920
- Great.
- Yeah?

16:43.962 --> 16:45.046
- When do we start?

16:45.088 --> 16:46.923
* *

16:46.965 --> 16:48.883
[dishes clatter]
- Now.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.885
- [laughs]
- What?

16:50.927 --> 16:52.762
- [sharply] Now.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.055
Like, right now.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.223
Immediately.

16:56.766 --> 16:57.851
- Immediately?

16:57.892 --> 16:59.269
- [laughs] He's joking.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.312
He's just--

17:01.354 --> 17:03.565
- Go pack a bag,

17:03.606 --> 17:05.025
go to LAX,

17:05.066 --> 17:07.819
get on the red-eye,
go to New York, get to work.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.405
It's gonna take
a couple of years.

17:10.447 --> 17:12.198
I'm gonna need you there
the whole time

17:12.240 --> 17:14.826
overseeing construction,
the plans,

17:14.868 --> 17:18.371
and you're not gonna be able
to come back here ever.

17:18.413 --> 17:23.793
* *

17:23.835 --> 17:26.296
- Why you doing this?

17:26.338 --> 17:28.757
Hm?
- Hm?

17:28.798 --> 17:30.884
- Why are you doing this
right now?

17:30.925 --> 17:32.177
Is it 'cause I invited him?

17:32.218 --> 17:35.096
- [laughs] What?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.639
I believe in Carlos.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.808
I like Carlos' business plan.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.936
Unless there's something
that Carlos loves

17:41.978 --> 17:45.148
more than money here in LA.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.358
Then he should stay.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.652
* *

17:49.694 --> 17:51.654
Okay.

17:51.696 --> 17:55.450
I just
transferred you $250,000.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.409
- [gasps]
- What?

17:56.451 --> 17:58.370
[phone chimes]

17:58.411 --> 18:01.373
[music darkens]

18:01.414 --> 18:03.500
* *

18:03.541 --> 18:04.918
- When I get
my investment back,

18:04.959 --> 18:06.544
we'll go 50/50.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.381
If it works out, I'll finance
a national rollout,

18:09.422 --> 18:12.384
but you gotta go right now.

18:12.425 --> 18:19.766
* *

18:20.392 --> 18:21.351
- [whispers]
You don't have to go.

18:21.393 --> 18:24.229
Babe, please, stay for me.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.730
- You gotta go, Carlos.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.066
* *

18:28.108 --> 18:29.275
- I'm sorry.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.153
- [gasps]
- Oh.

18:32.195 --> 18:35.281
[indistinct whispers]

18:41.871 --> 18:42.789
[door shuts]

18:44.541 --> 18:47.043
- Are you fucking insane?

18:47.085 --> 18:51.256
* *

18:51.297 --> 18:53.425
Why would you do that?

18:53.466 --> 18:55.885
Why the fuck do you even care?

18:57.137 --> 18:59.222
- [scoffs]

18:59.264 --> 19:00.974
- God.
- [clears throat]

19:02.267 --> 19:03.435
- Hey, buddy.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.978
You got
some interesting friends.

19:05.020 --> 19:08.398
- Okay, let's help
some teen runaways!

19:08.440 --> 19:10.066
- [crying]

19:10.108 --> 19:12.277
- Oh, my God.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.154
I cannot believe that happened.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.655
[soft dramatic music]

19:15.697 --> 19:16.656
You okay?

19:16.698 --> 19:18.199
I know you really loved Carlos.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.743
- Oh, fuck Carlos.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.494
[sniffles]
I never loved Carlos,

19:21.536 --> 19:24.664
but fuck him for leaving.

19:24.706 --> 19:28.251
- Well, I mean, we all know
you're gonna be just fine.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.170
- Will I?
- Yes.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.089
- 'Cause I feel like
I'm pretty fucked right now.

19:33.131 --> 19:37.135
Ava, look at my life right now.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.720
Take a good look.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.097
You gotta let me in
on the podcast.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.808
Okay? It's--it's literally
all that I got.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.810
* *

19:45.852 --> 19:48.104
- Okay, uh, maybe we should
talk about this another time.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.148
- No, no, no, 'cause--
'cause I can help you.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.359
You know, you--you know
I'm great with marketing.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.944
Right? And branding,
and I know this world.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.364
And we're the "Wine & Crime"
girls, right?

19:57.405 --> 19:58.907
- Yeah, I can't do this.
- Oh, well, I--

19:58.948 --> 20:00.825
because do you remember
that guy--

20:00.867 --> 20:02.744
that guy that I had
a thing with in Cabo last year?

20:02.786 --> 20:05.205
'Cause he's huge at Wondery,

20:05.246 --> 20:06.331
and--and he's married,

20:06.373 --> 20:07.749
so he definitely owes me
a solid.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.918
I can get him to make us
a preemptive offer,

20:09.959 --> 20:12.629
you know, probably
a really, really big one.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.255
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

20:14.297 --> 20:18.635
- So some guy is gonna make us
a multimillion-dollar offer

20:18.677 --> 20:20.470
because he went down on you
in Cabo?

20:20.512 --> 20:23.348
- Yeah, that is
how the world works.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.225
How do you not know that?

20:25.266 --> 20:27.018
- Okay, just trust me.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.104
You shouldn't get involved
in this 'cause it's a mess.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.480
- Okay, hold on.

20:30.522 --> 20:31.648
Don't come at me like
you're my friend now.

20:31.690 --> 20:33.191
- What?
- No, I know exactly

20:33.233 --> 20:34.776
what's going on.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.529
I mean, I know
Matt's the killer.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.864
- I have no fucking idea
what you're talking about.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.324
- Okay.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.909
So if I took Matt's wine glass

20:42.951 --> 20:44.661
and took it down
to the police station,

20:44.703 --> 20:47.997
you're telling me that his DNA
wouldn't be an exact match

20:48.039 --> 20:49.499
to the Westside Ripper?

20:49.541 --> 20:52.669
[foreboding music]

20:52.711 --> 20:54.713
- If you tell a single person
about this,

20:54.754 --> 20:57.465
I will fucking end you.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.092
- But I already told Simon.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.387
- What?
- Yeah.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.389
I told him.
- You told--

21:04.431 --> 21:06.016
you told Simon?
Are you insane?

21:06.057 --> 21:08.351
Why would you do that?
- Because he's a lawyer,

21:08.393 --> 21:09.769
and he will protect me!

21:09.811 --> 21:12.022
- Oh, my God.
He's not gonna protect you.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.482
He fucking hates you.
He hates everything about you!

21:14.524 --> 21:16.693
- Oh, sweetie. [scoffs]

21:16.735 --> 21:18.111
That's just married talk.

21:18.153 --> 21:19.654
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I can't believe

21:19.696 --> 21:21.239
you would be stupid enough

21:21.281 --> 21:22.782
to fucking tell Simon!

21:22.824 --> 21:25.160
- Oh, I absolutely am
that stupid.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.703
And why not?

21:26.745 --> 21:29.914
I mean, it's worked pretty well
for me so far, right?

21:29.956 --> 21:31.416
Tell me something.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.044
Who's the one
living in a mansion

21:34.085 --> 21:36.880
in the Palisades,

21:36.921 --> 21:39.424
and who can't afford
their mortgage in Mar Vista?

21:40.550 --> 21:42.093
- Okay, you listen to me,

21:42.135 --> 21:44.637
you with your little
400 calories a day,

21:44.679 --> 21:46.848
your cool sculpt,
and your amazing blowjobs

21:46.890 --> 21:47.974
you can't stop bragging about--

21:48.016 --> 21:50.060
- They are amazing.
- Well,

21:50.101 --> 21:52.729
not amazing enough
to keep Carlos around.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.564
So if you wanna go steal

21:54.606 --> 21:56.399
the Westside Ripper's
wine glass,

21:56.441 --> 21:57.859
good fucking luck.

21:57.901 --> 21:58.985
- Fuck you.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.737
Fuck you, 'cause Nathan
will bring me in

22:00.779 --> 22:03.573
'cause he is nothing like you!

22:03.615 --> 22:05.575
He will cut me in!

22:05.617 --> 22:08.119
And my blowjobs
are the fucking best!

22:08.161 --> 22:09.329
[sniffles]

22:09.371 --> 22:12.415
Everyone in LA knows it...

22:12.457 --> 22:13.750
and Dubai.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.464
- 900, $900.
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:19.506 --> 22:20.757
it would be a dream
within a dream

22:20.799 --> 22:22.676
if we got to $1,000.

22:22.717 --> 22:25.470
Do I hear 1, $1,000

22:25.512 --> 22:26.721
for the Edgar Allan Poe brick.

22:26.763 --> 22:27.972
How 'bout a 1,200?
Who'll do a 1,200?

22:28.014 --> 22:29.432
There's a fan
of blood and murder for 1,200.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.267
- Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

22:31.309 --> 22:33.186
- Hold on, these fuckers are
trying to steal your brick.

22:33.228 --> 22:34.646
- $1,300.
- Okay, but--

22:34.688 --> 22:37.357
[sighs]
I need you for one second.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.025
- We're gonna lose the brick.
- I don't care.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.735
Just come on.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.070
So here's the thing--
don't panic

22:42.112 --> 22:43.780
when I tell you this--
but I lost the burner.

22:43.822 --> 22:44.781
- What?
- I got it back,

22:44.823 --> 22:45.824
but I dropped it in Vegas,

22:45.865 --> 22:47.242
and then Ruby, she found it,

22:47.283 --> 22:48.368
and now she's blackmailing...
- Oh, my fucking God.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.327
- Us and wants in
on everything.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.495
- Ruby?
- Yes.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.413
- How did you not
know you dropped it?

22:51.454 --> 22:52.414
- It was an accident! Okay?

22:52.455 --> 22:53.498
We had been using yours.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.624
I barely use mine.
I thought it was

22:54.666 --> 22:55.875
in my bag, but it fell out.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.335
I know I fucked up,
but she knows everything.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.170
She knows that Matt
is the Westside Ripper,

22:59.212 --> 23:01.131
and she told me
that she told Simon.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.883
- She told Simon?
- Well, she might be bluffing.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.635
I don't fuckin' know, but--
- This is fine. It's fine.

23:05.677 --> 23:06.845
[dog whines]
We're gonna figure this out.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.138
But this place is toxic.

23:08.179 --> 23:09.764
Okay? I'm telling you,
it's fucking toxic.

23:09.806 --> 23:12.017
They're nuts.
I'm taking McEnroe outta here.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.935
- Babe, who fucking cares
about the dog right now?

23:13.977 --> 23:15.478
Just forget the fuckin' dog.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.063
[phone chimes]
We have bigger problems.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.025
What? What?
- Oh, shit.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.069
Alba, she just came out
against us.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.279
- No, not Alba.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.530
- Jessica Alba just tweeted,

23:25.572 --> 23:27.907
"If #BasedOnATrueStory
is true, it's sickening.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.409
"If it's fake,
it might be even worse.

23:29.451 --> 23:30.702
"America,
we're better than this.

23:30.744 --> 23:33.455
#CancelBasedOnATrueStory."

23:33.496 --> 23:35.040
- Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.958
Okay, oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, my God.

23:37.000 --> 23:37.959
Okay, maybe
it's not gonna track.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.627
Maybe no one's gonna pick
this up.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.047
- Oh, shit.
Malia Obama just retweeted it.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.048
[phones chiming]

23:43.089 --> 23:45.050
- Oh, my God, so did Tom Hanks.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.260
- Kylie Jenner.
- Oh, my God.

23:47.302 --> 23:49.137
So did Dame Judi Dench.

23:49.179 --> 23:51.056
- Oh, I'm so sorry, babe.
- Oh, my God.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.558
- I know you love her.
- Are you seeing this shit?

23:53.600 --> 23:54.768
- Yes.
- We're gonna get canceled?

23:54.809 --> 23:56.811
Alba fucked us.
- Okay, is there anyone

23:56.853 --> 23:57.896
that's for us?

23:57.937 --> 23:59.481
- For us? Um--
- Who is? Look.

23:59.522 --> 24:00.732
- Kanye?
- Okay, Kanye?

24:00.774 --> 24:02.192
- Ugh, that's not good.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.234
- The dude from NXIVM.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.527
- Josh Duggar?

24:04.569 --> 24:05.862
- Jared from Subway.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.113
- That's not good.
- That's bad.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.198
- No.

24:08.239 --> 24:09.908
- This is fuckin' awful.
[phone chimes]

24:09.949 --> 24:11.076
- There goes iTunes.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.410
- We lost iTunes?
- Yes.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.536
- Okay.

24:13.578 --> 24:14.788
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.331
You and me,
we're gettin' outta here.

24:16.373 --> 24:17.916
We're takin' the dog.
We'll call you from the road.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.376
- You're taking
the fucking dog?

24:19.417 --> 24:20.418
Our brand is under attack.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.711
We gotta act now.
[dog whines]

24:21.753 --> 24:23.588
Here's our play, okay?

24:23.630 --> 24:25.131
The snowflakes can suck it.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.676
We're gonna double down
just like our fans want.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.010
I'm gonna go out tonight...
- No.

24:29.052 --> 24:31.888
- And I will--
- We are not doing that, okay?

24:31.930 --> 24:33.765
We have to do something,
but we are not doing that.

24:33.807 --> 24:34.766
You guys,
if we don't do something,

24:34.808 --> 24:37.102
we are gonna lose
the Spotify deal.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.812
Do you understand?
So what do we do?

24:38.853 --> 24:40.438
- Wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.648
Wait a minute.
Doesn't...

24:41.690 --> 24:44.818
doesn't Ruby know Alba?

24:44.859 --> 24:47.070
- Yes. You know what?
She was her body double

24:47.112 --> 24:48.363
in "Spy Kids 4."

24:48.405 --> 24:49.572
- Remember, she had the wig
and the costume on

24:49.614 --> 24:50.782
one night after shooting?

24:50.824 --> 24:52.409
- She loves to hold
that over me.

24:52.450 --> 24:53.618
- She went down on Kid Rock.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.869
Someone took a photo.
- Yeah.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.705
- Why don't we get Ruby
to tell Alba

24:56.746 --> 24:58.456
that we'll release
the fuckin' photo

24:58.498 --> 24:59.791
unless she pulls the post?

24:59.833 --> 25:00.959
- Why would Alba care?

25:01.001 --> 25:02.127
It's not her in the picture.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.920
- It doesn't matter.
It looks like her.

25:03.962 --> 25:05.797
- No, the tweet's out there.
It's taken flight.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.007
- You go talk to Ruby.

25:07.048 --> 25:08.299
I'll find out what Simon knows.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.593
- Ruby's not gonna do shit
for us right now.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.637
Trust me.
- It's all we fuckin' got,

25:12.679 --> 25:14.180
guys. Let's go. Go.
- [clapping]

25:14.222 --> 25:16.474
Big man, everyone!

25:17.517 --> 25:19.310
Big fuckin' man.

25:19.352 --> 25:22.397
What kind of control freak buys
his wife's boyfriend, huh?

25:22.439 --> 25:23.940
- You're the one
who invited him, honey,

25:23.982 --> 25:25.108
in front of all of our friends.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.693
- Yeah, you know why?
You know why?

25:26.735 --> 25:29.029
'Cause you can't get it up
unless you call me "Mommy."

25:29.070 --> 25:30.989
Do you guys know that?
What's up with that?

25:31.031 --> 25:33.324
You miss sucking
on Mommy's titties, huh?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.827
- Yes! Yes, I do!

25:35.869 --> 25:37.287
You know what?
I actually like

25:37.328 --> 25:39.622
sucking Mom's tits
better than yours!

25:39.664 --> 25:41.207
[dog barks]
- Guys, that's not great

25:41.249 --> 25:42.625
for the dog.
- Or anyone.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.962
- Even if I stitched
Michael Fassbender's foreskin

25:46.004 --> 25:47.881
onto Orlando Bloom's dick...
[dog barking]

25:47.922 --> 25:50.008
And Frankensteined
the perfect penis,

25:50.050 --> 25:51.926
I still couldn't get it up
for you!

25:51.968 --> 25:53.303
- Are you gonna finally
stroke out

25:53.345 --> 25:56.014
and leave me with all
your daddy's money, huh?

25:56.056 --> 25:59.768
- Come on. Come on, McEnroe.
Come on.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.979
Okay, stay here,
and stay quiet.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.397
I'm gonna get you outta here
tonight.

26:04.439 --> 26:05.482
Okay? Yeah.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.025
- You think that hurt me?

26:07.067 --> 26:08.860
You think sending him away
hurt me?

26:08.902 --> 26:10.195
- Okay!
- You can't fucking hurt me.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.780
- What do you want?
You want the spa day

26:11.821 --> 26:13.114
at the Peninsula, honey, huh?

26:13.156 --> 26:14.324
Do you want the deep tissue?

26:14.366 --> 26:16.034
Do you want me
to buy that for you?

26:16.076 --> 26:17.744
- You're gonna continue
to buy my love!

26:17.786 --> 26:19.245
You're a fucking monster,

26:19.287 --> 26:21.247
and you've never loved anything

26:21.289 --> 26:24.000
in your entire life
except that dog!

26:24.042 --> 26:26.378
That's it!
How pathetic is that, everyone?

26:26.419 --> 26:28.880
- So now it's the dog's fault?
- Oh, sure!

26:28.922 --> 26:30.173
Yeah, it's the dog's fault!
[dog barking]

26:30.215 --> 26:32.008
Sure,
it's the fucking dog's fault!

26:32.050 --> 26:33.343
- You want me
to shut the dog up?

26:33.385 --> 26:35.178
- Yeah, go shut
the fucking dog up!

26:35.220 --> 26:37.055
- Okay.
I'll shut the fucking dog up!

26:37.097 --> 26:38.056
- Do you need Mommy's help?

26:38.098 --> 26:39.808
You think you can handle that?

26:39.849 --> 26:40.767
You got that, hon?

26:40.809 --> 26:42.394
Goddamn it!

26:42.435 --> 26:44.813

a terrible time.

I'm so sorry,
but, um, you're friends

26:46.773 --> 26:48.024

actually.
