WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:03.904
(spoon scraping)

00:03.937 --> 00:06.040
(gasps)
Ticktock, little bird.

00:06.074 --> 00:10.411
ANNOUNCER: Legion.
All new, Mondays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.847
(dance music)

00:13.881 --> 00:16.284
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Pose.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.021
* One, two, three, hit it... *

00:22.423 --> 00:24.558
DAMON:
Okay, chin up, chin up.
I don't want to see you

00:24.592 --> 00:25.826
going on the floor.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.528
If you look down,
you're gonna be on the floor.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.398
Ow, one, two, three, hit it.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.566
Bitch, I'm gonna have to take
you to the balls with me.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.102
You are slaying that. No shade.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.903
Good job. Good-- great work.
Great work, ladies.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.771
Okay, I will
see you next week, okay?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.740
Excellent work. Excellent.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.375
-(turns off music)
-Payday.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.578
Ooh. Uh-huh,
what you got for me?

00:44.612 --> 00:46.914
What you got for me? Let's see.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.850
Am I gonna buy me a good dinner

00:49.883 --> 00:51.652
today or what?

00:55.789 --> 00:57.891
(sighs)
Just enough for bus fare.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.693
You get paid by the head.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.796
Maybe we can try
to put some flyers around

01:02.830 --> 01:05.799
-or something.
-Flyers won't put "Vogue"
back on the charts.

01:05.833 --> 01:06.867
People have moved on.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.702
We need to cancel
next week's class.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.439
It's just not worth it
for three students.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.974
I've had some requests
about learning the moves

01:14.007 --> 01:17.211
from the "U Can't Touch This"
video. Any interest?

01:17.245 --> 01:19.113
Girl, stop. Hammertime?

01:19.147 --> 01:21.915
It's just until the next
big thing comes along.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.952
Remember, white folks
like to visit,

01:24.985 --> 01:26.487
but they never move in.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.290
-That part.
-Mm-hmm.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.891
All right, well, I'll see you.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.993
-(crowd cheering)
-PRAY TELL: Who wants

01:33.026 --> 01:37.498
to dine with the ladies
at The Plaza?

01:37.531 --> 01:40.334
Because the category is...

01:40.368 --> 01:42.603
Realness.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.638
Bring it like a lady at brunch.

01:44.672 --> 01:48.809
Oh, shit,
look at these boozy bitches.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.812
Honey, after having
finished snoozing

01:51.845 --> 01:53.947
on fine sheets,

01:53.981 --> 01:58.186
they missed breakfast and
they booked a massage at lunch,

01:58.219 --> 01:59.853
and so now they indulge

01:59.887 --> 02:03.657
in an extravagant
in-between meal.

02:03.691 --> 02:08.162
Caviar, Bloody Marys, baby.

02:08.196 --> 02:11.265
Brunch is for some alcoholic
bitches that ain't got to work.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.633
(laughter)

02:12.666 --> 02:15.169
Yes, baby, this category
is informational.

02:15.203 --> 02:19.473
Judges, your scores.
Ten, ten, nine,

02:19.507 --> 02:20.874
nine, ten.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.476
Come on and get this trophy

02:22.510 --> 02:25.479
in this cream bobcat fur, bitch.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.549
You better have on
that bobcat today.

02:28.582 --> 02:29.817
(cheering)

02:29.850 --> 02:31.619
Uh-huh.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.020
* On the shelf above *

02:33.053 --> 02:35.889
* 'Cause it was built
for love... *

02:35.923 --> 02:36.890
All right, look.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.692
Listen, cut the music
for a second.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.894
-(music stops)
-Listen, I want to talk to y'all
for a second.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.396
I see what you see.
The looky-loos

02:42.430 --> 02:43.697
have left the building.

02:43.731 --> 02:47.568
America's obsession
with "Vogue" is dead.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.170
Now, I ain't gonna say
I told you so,

02:50.204 --> 02:54.242
even though I had told you so.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.177
(laughter)

02:57.211 --> 02:59.213
But I want y'all
to remember something--

02:59.247 --> 03:02.082
ballroom is gonna continue
to be ballroom.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.184
We're gonna continue to create

03:04.218 --> 03:06.887
like we always do,
and soon enough,

03:06.920 --> 03:10.424
the looky-loos will notice
and they'll be back.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.893
I don't want none of y'all
getting down on yourselves.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.194
You hear me?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.195
Yes?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.400
-All right.
-(cheering)

03:20.468 --> 03:22.436
(door opens)

03:22.470 --> 03:24.572
(footfalls approach)

03:24.605 --> 03:27.174
PRAY TELL:
The category is...

03:27.207 --> 03:30.511
Live...

03:30.544 --> 03:32.846
Work...

03:32.880 --> 03:36.550
Pose!

03:58.171 --> 04:00.308
My nerves are still tender
about that Frederica business.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.242
-You know what she did?
-What?

04:02.276 --> 04:04.612
She told Page Six
that all of us protesting

04:04.645 --> 04:08.048
-left hypodermic needles
and condoms...
-(groans)

04:08.081 --> 04:10.884
...laying around in a gutter
in front of my nail salon.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.586
-No, she didn't.
-Yes.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.722
It was on the news this morning.
And they didn't

04:14.755 --> 04:16.223
necessarily use the words HIV,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.058
but we already know
what they were implying.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.728
The world is scared of us,
and she's using that to beat me.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.297
Evil but smart.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.598
And you know what?

04:24.632 --> 04:27.901
I heard Lulu was in a bad way,
because of Candy,

04:27.935 --> 04:29.470
so I went to check on her.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.472
("Straight Up"
by Paula Abdul playing)

04:31.505 --> 04:33.574
(indistinct chatter)

04:33.607 --> 04:35.643
BLANCA:
Bad way was an understatement.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.482
You look terrible.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.016
I can see right
through your skin,

04:43.050 --> 04:44.785
and your eyes
look like glass marbles.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.921
I been hearing bad things
about you.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.623
PRAY TELL:
What did she say?

04:49.657 --> 04:53.193
She said her dehydrated look
came from her asthma inhaler.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.295
-Do you believe her?
-I don't know.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.430
But even if she
ain't on the pipe,

04:56.464 --> 04:58.766
that girl is falling apart.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.968
And it ain't just her;
the boys are straying, too.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.670
Damon's been sleeping until noon

05:02.703 --> 05:04.772
ever since his classes
got canceled down at the Y,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.440
and Ricky ain't no better.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.275
-He's always here.
-Are they back together?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.110
Nah, I think Damon
is through with all that.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.046
All they do is drink
wine coolers and watch TV.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.549
-(indistinct chatter on TV)
-(chuckling)

05:15.583 --> 05:17.385
BLANCA:
Oh, uh-uh, no.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.454
Y'all are not spending
another day sitting around,

05:20.488 --> 05:22.322
stinking up my house,
doing nothing.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.157
What you expect us to do?

05:24.191 --> 05:26.860
Well, here's a wild thought: get
a job, or maybe clean a dish.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.129
I need help keeping
this family afloat.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.398
Well, you just don't understand.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.665
I mean, it's just like
they got tired

05:31.699 --> 05:33.501
of what we had to offer
and just threw us away.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.968
-Damon.
-Damn, can't I get at least

05:35.002 --> 05:36.737
a minute just to regroup
before you have me

05:36.770 --> 05:38.138
go out there
and hurt myself again?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.674
I do understand, Damon.
Excuse me.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.645
(clears throat)

05:44.678 --> 05:46.313
Get your ass up
and do something.

05:46.346 --> 05:50.718
I remember when I first
found my way to New York City.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.352
Things were really bad,

05:52.386 --> 05:54.555
-but we survived.
-How?

05:54.588 --> 05:56.424
The elders.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.991
When the going gets tough,

05:58.025 --> 06:00.428
it's up to the elders
to light the way.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.262
And where are
these elders at now?

06:02.295 --> 06:05.065
You looking at 'em right here.

06:05.098 --> 06:08.836
Oh, excuse me? Oh, no, sir.
I refuse that title.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.771
Mm-hmm. Being a survivor

06:10.804 --> 06:13.006
is a blessing and a curse.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.276
And we're surviving
and we have to help those kids.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.713
Pray has a plan.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.582
What is it?

06:21.615 --> 06:24.885
(clears throat)
Those children need a caper.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.720
-Pray, a caper?
-Mm. And Daddy got

06:26.754 --> 06:30.591
a little something-something
up her sleeve.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.560
(laughs)

06:32.593 --> 06:34.428
BLANCA:
You're late.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.229
It's 10:00 in the morning.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.899
School's in session.
Have a seat.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.702
(exhales) What we learning?

06:41.735 --> 06:44.572
Self-respect. Responsibility.
Motivation.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.406
The three of y'all
have lost y'all way.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.577
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
We've worked hard.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.378
I mean, it's not our fault that
things in our professional life

06:51.411 --> 06:52.580
just didn't work out.

06:52.613 --> 06:56.083
I thought you were a tour
dancer. What happened to that?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.418
Callbacks with no hires.
That's what happened.

06:58.452 --> 07:01.755
And I'm trying,
but I'm just not booking.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.458
So you've hit a bump in the
road. Welcome to the world.

07:04.492 --> 07:07.260
BLANCA:
Y'all stories don't just
have to be about failure.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.630
It needs to be about resilience.

07:09.663 --> 07:14.234
So... me and Pray got a job
for you three.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.669
Well, how much does it pay?

07:15.703 --> 07:18.071
'Cause I'm still pulling
good tips down at the club.

07:18.105 --> 07:22.843
It pays in experience.
It pays in purpose.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.344
ACT UP is looking

07:24.377 --> 07:27.515
to make a statement
about safe sex,

07:27.548 --> 07:30.083
and they want to do something
that's gonna get on the news.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.186
So Blanca and I have come up
with a little caper

07:33.220 --> 07:35.589
with flair.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.290
The three of you
are gonna head upstate

07:37.324 --> 07:39.960
and wrap one of those high
society dames's country house

07:39.993 --> 07:41.461
in a giant condom.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.664
-(laughter)
-Are you serious?

07:43.697 --> 07:45.599
What's so funny?

07:45.633 --> 07:48.602
Girl, that's crazy.
I mean, whose house?

07:48.636 --> 07:50.638
Frederica Norman's.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.840
I thought I might kill two birds
with one stone.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.708
It's an opportunity
to highlight her bigotry

07:54.742 --> 07:57.144
and get the message out
about condom use.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.378
Yeah, this is crazy.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.681
How we gonna find a condom
that's big as a house?

08:00.714 --> 08:02.850
You got a week. Figure it out.

08:02.883 --> 08:06.620
A week? It'll take us three days
to put up a lemonade stand.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.288
It's not supposed to be easy.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.724
It's not just about being mad
you fell down,

08:10.758 --> 08:13.193
it's about loving you enough
to show you the way to get up.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.700
DAMON:
Okay,

08:19.733 --> 08:22.836
so what's on the brainstorming
list so far?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.304
Um...

08:24.337 --> 08:26.874
One, buy a thousand condoms
and glue 'em together.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.743
Two, use a thousand boxes
of plastic wrap

08:29.777 --> 08:31.745
from Key Food
to wrap around the house.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.547
That's it?

08:33.581 --> 08:35.883
(crying)

08:35.916 --> 08:38.185
What's wrong?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.156
(crying):
I feel so dumb.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.525
I used to be smart.

08:45.559 --> 08:49.897
I did community college
and I took accounting classes.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.566
And now...

08:52.600 --> 08:55.603
now I'm just some dumb stripper

08:55.636 --> 08:57.771
who can't do nothing on her own.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.607
-RICKY: Oh, come here.
-LULU: I didn't realize

08:59.640 --> 09:02.910
till Candy was gone how much
she took care of things.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.244
Mm-mm. You know what?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.847
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Listen to me.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.716
The world thinks we're dumb,

09:08.749 --> 09:10.050
'cause we don't have a fancy job

09:10.083 --> 09:12.786
or talk
like Masterpiece Theatre.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.923
But I would love to see some
of those Harvard types

09:15.956 --> 09:17.057
try to figure our life out.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.693
-They wouldn't last a day.
-Mm-mm.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.596
Right now if you still here...

09:22.630 --> 09:25.465
you know, living your life...

09:25.498 --> 09:27.701
you already a genius.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.603
-(sniffs)
-Hmm?

09:29.637 --> 09:32.305
Now, I know that's what Blanca
and Pray Tell want.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.776
They want us to remember
how smart we are.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.113
Which is why...

09:40.147 --> 09:41.815
okay, we need to try
to figure this out.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.451
We're struggling because
we're looking at this thing

09:44.484 --> 09:46.553
as a big, giant thing, okay?

09:46.586 --> 09:47.821
We need to just break it down
into pieces.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.589
One step at a time.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.060
And the first step is, we need
to go up and measure

09:53.093 --> 09:56.329
the house and figure out
how big the condom needs to be.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.231
How are we gonna find
a condom that big?

09:58.265 --> 10:01.835
I mean... we could always
just use one of mine.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.937
Maybe if we were wrapping
a doll house.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.272
Hold up.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.842
Y'all ever seen one of those
big inflatable houses

10:08.876 --> 10:11.011
they use at kids' parties
and, like, fairs and stuff?

10:11.044 --> 10:15.015
-Mm-hmm.
-What if there's a company
that can make us one

10:15.048 --> 10:17.450
that's the right size
and shaped like a rubber?

10:17.484 --> 10:18.585
I'll grab the Yellow Pages.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.088
DAMON:
All right, so step three...

10:21.121 --> 10:24.224
Figuring out how the hell
we're gonna pay for it.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.111
(knocking on door)

10:44.144 --> 10:46.714
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.015
Sorry to wake you.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.051
I heard you sneak in mad late
from work last night.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.554
Figured all that hard work

10:54.587 --> 10:58.225
deserved a...
a nice home-cooked meal.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.961
So then I took it upon myself...

11:00.994 --> 11:03.530
to prepare you one.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.133
Damn, girl.
I ain't even know you cooked.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.368
-(chuckles)
-I ain't never seen you
in no kitchen.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.170
Oh, my God.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.040
You know a lady
don't reveal her cards.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.175
-Not all of them at once.
-(laughs)

11:15.208 --> 11:18.211
-(giggles)
-So what you up to today?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.313
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.916
Miss Ford got me a membership
at this club.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.253
Called Nells.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.256
A lot of editorial people
and photographers be there.

11:29.289 --> 11:33.026
Apparently.
So she wants me to,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.995
she wants me to mingle
and be seen.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.530
-That's the one on
14th and 8th, right?
-That's the one.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.432
Yo, you know I used to pick
pockets at the velvet rope.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.268
-(scoffs) Of course you did.
-(laughs)

11:41.301 --> 11:43.103
Them people were so desperate
to get in,

11:43.136 --> 11:45.338
they never minded their wallets.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.607
Angel, you fancy now, girl.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.076
Aye, please.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.944
Come on, you moving up
in the world.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.383
I feel like a fake next to them
fancy-ass phony people.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.951
Why you say that?

12:02.555 --> 12:05.092
I feel like when they look at
me, they see a pretty picture

12:05.125 --> 12:06.559
-but they don't really see me.
-Mm.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.694
You know?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.196
They don't need
to know all that.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.965
It ain't their business.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.067
I'm sure mystery is good
for models, right?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.136
Makes y'all more interesting.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.106
I guess.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.274
But, Papi, what if they,
what if they find out about...

12:21.308 --> 12:22.810
About what?

12:22.843 --> 12:26.013
-You know...
-They're not gonna
find out, Angel.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.248
(phone rings)

12:28.281 --> 12:31.318
Look, you deserve to be
with them important people.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.920
You doing big things, Angel.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.288
-And the world is taking notice.
-(ringing continues)

12:38.992 --> 12:40.994
Run! Run!

12:42.863 --> 12:44.832
ANGEL:
Hello?

12:44.865 --> 12:46.834
Oh, my God!

12:46.867 --> 12:48.668
What?

12:48.701 --> 12:50.103
I promise.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.505
I will not disappoint you,
Miss Ford.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.276
Okay, bye.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.548
(Angel exhales)

13:03.016 --> 13:04.985
(exhales)

13:07.821 --> 13:10.523
-I'm the new Bebe girl!
-No!

13:10.557 --> 13:13.293
Yo, that's what
I'm talking about!

13:13.326 --> 13:15.929
Yo, I told you you fancy now!

13:15.963 --> 13:18.331
-You know what?
-(chuckles)

13:18.365 --> 13:20.200
We celebrating tonight.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.801
I'm coming with you to Nells.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.171
Only-only if you come
as my boyfriend.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.339
All right.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.379
Come on, come on!

13:33.413 --> 13:35.182
(quietly):
Get the measuring tape.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.854
(camera clicks)

13:40.888 --> 13:42.455
-(dog barks)
-Let's go, let's go!

13:42.489 --> 13:44.657
LULU:
So all we need

13:44.691 --> 13:46.526
-is just, you know...
-Some money?

13:46.559 --> 13:48.161
Absolutely not.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.662
I'm not a charitable foundation.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.498
I'm a single mother
with children to clothe

13:51.531 --> 13:53.166
and bills to pay.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.905
You know, it's a shame everybody
in the ballroom

13:57.938 --> 14:00.507
completely overlooked your
Marie Antoinette at the ball.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.977
Only because of Pray Tell
and his flaming preacher act.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.579
It would've been the stunt
of the century.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.349
You built a fucking guillotine
and a carousel,

14:09.382 --> 14:12.152
and all anyone ever talks about
is how he read you for filth

14:12.185 --> 14:14.754
because you didn't come
to that protest.

14:14.787 --> 14:18.091
His agenda tarnished
my icon status.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.828
Well, if you help me with this,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.363
you'll prove everybody wrong.

14:24.431 --> 14:28.235
You'll show Pray and the council
and the judges

14:28.268 --> 14:31.871
that you have a heart,
that you actually care.

14:31.905 --> 14:35.909
Not just about Wintours, but all
the children in ballroom.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.545
All the children in the world.

14:38.578 --> 14:43.083
This tiny donation will be
an investment...

14:43.116 --> 14:46.353
for your good image.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.889
It could raise the deck for you
for Mother of the Year.

14:49.923 --> 14:52.725
Who's supplying the condom?

14:52.759 --> 14:54.727
The same company that made
the big jump house

14:54.761 --> 14:56.629
for the Italian Pride parade
on Mulberry.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.431
The one with the giant
leaning tower on top?

14:58.465 --> 15:00.600
That was impressive.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.369
How much do you need?

15:02.402 --> 15:03.937
$2,500.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.279
That's $1,000.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.114
Giving you any more would
deny you the opportunity

15:14.147 --> 15:15.448
of earning your charity.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.584
But don't worry, Lulu dear.

15:21.654 --> 15:25.458
Mother Elektra is going to
help with that, too.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.735
(chain rattles)

15:35.768 --> 15:38.338
-(whip cracking)
-(man grunting)

15:40.773 --> 15:42.675
* Hangin' out for a body shop
at night *

15:42.709 --> 15:47.147
* Ain't it strange what we do
to feel all right? *

15:47.180 --> 15:49.682
I have a treat for you,
Mr. Hosiery:

15:49.716 --> 15:51.484
Mistress Lucinda.

15:51.518 --> 15:55.522
She's twice the mean bitch I am,
and costs double.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.598
-(grunts)
-(man groans)

16:05.632 --> 16:07.000
Harder.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.470
That's my baby girl.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.642
-(man cries out)
-(laughs)

16:15.675 --> 16:16.843
MAN:
Yes!

16:26.053 --> 16:27.287
Angel.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.656
-Hey.
-Darling.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.491
-Katie. How you doing?
-Good. How are you?

16:31.524 --> 16:34.527
So nice to-to see you.
This is Esteban. We're together.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.464
Yo, I know it's official
when you use my government name.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.631
(Angel chuckles)

16:38.665 --> 16:41.568
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.371
* A time to turn over *

16:44.404 --> 16:46.739
* A better life
for you and me... *

16:46.773 --> 16:49.376
Yo, look at these walls. God,
I can't believe we're in here.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.045
Oh, for sure.
Don't steal from nobody.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.081
-No pickpocketing.
-I can't promise nothing.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.848
-* Channel all this energy *
-ANGEL: Wow.

16:55.882 --> 17:00.053
Wow. Look, they got it
at the tables.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.821
Bella!

17:01.854 --> 17:03.756
-Mario!
-Where have you been
all my life, huh?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.726
What's going on? I didn't know
you was gonna be here.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.828
Darling, girl, I'm anywhere
with an open tab at the bar.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.598
-Thirsty?
-Yeah, let's get a drink.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.732
* When love takes hold... *

17:12.765 --> 17:13.733
-For you.
-Thank you.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.068
Do you like the bubbles,
handsome?

17:15.102 --> 17:16.736
Yeah. For sure.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.004
MARIO:
Cheers.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.872
BOTH:
Cheers.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.909
Now that we're all the best
of friends, follow me to VIP.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.778
-Follow you to VIP.
-All right. (chuckles)

17:25.812 --> 17:27.780
(faintly):
* Touch me... *

17:27.814 --> 17:30.450
-(sniffs)
-Bella! Save some for me, huh?

17:30.483 --> 17:34.221
Oh, there's plenty more where
that came from, Mario dear.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.123
Damn, they be doing this shit
out in public

17:36.156 --> 17:37.724
-in front of everybody?
-It's not public.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.094
This is members only, baby. VIP.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.130
(sniffs, exhales)

17:43.163 --> 17:45.031
You want?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.734
-Nah, we good. Thank you.
-I would not be a good friend

17:47.767 --> 17:51.638
if I don't let you know
this is the primo stuff.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.939
Medical-grade goods.

17:52.972 --> 17:56.042
Surely can't compare to
the street drugs uptown.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.877
-Who that bitch talking to?
-Yo, Angel, Angel.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.446
-MARIO: She didn't
mean nothing by it.
-No, no.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.482
-Not today.
-MARIO: But she is right.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.417
This is pharmaceutical flake.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.918
No side effects. No hangover.

18:05.952 --> 18:10.757
Just uninterrupted euphoria,
all night long.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.425
You two lovebirds want a taste?

18:12.459 --> 18:14.961
* Drive me crazy *

18:14.994 --> 18:16.829
* Touch me... *

18:16.863 --> 18:18.431
Hey, my man.
Where the, uh,

18:18.465 --> 18:20.667
where the bathrooms at?
Where the bathrooms at?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.235
Thank you.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.504
-Okay, let's go.
-Yeah.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.906
-Let's go pee.
-We'll be right back.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.107
All right?

18:28.141 --> 18:30.109
LIL PAPI:
Angel, you can't do that.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.744
You know how Blanca is
about drugs.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.813
Shit, I was homeless for, like,
a month for selling weed, mama.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.616
Imagine what she would do if
she heard we was sniffing coke.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.951
-Did you not hear him?
-I can't understand
what he's saying.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.187
Oh, my God.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.522
Pharmaceuticals is stuff
doctors prescribe.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.956
It's basically medicine.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.659
Why would they give it to them
if it's gonna hurt them?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.094
So, you're telling me
it's medicine,

18:48.127 --> 18:49.929
like-like the vities we've been
taking at home?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.097
Yeah.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.500
Shit, why didn't you
say that, then? Come on.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.609
* Let your conscience go. *

19:02.642 --> 19:04.477
("Do Me" by Bell Biv DeVoe
playing)

19:04.511 --> 19:06.779
* Do me, yeah *

19:06.813 --> 19:11.117
* Oh, yeah, oh, yeah *

19:11.150 --> 19:13.386
* Oh, ah *

19:13.420 --> 19:17.957
* Oh, yeah, oh, yeah *

19:17.990 --> 19:22.395
* Oh, yeah,
oh, yeah *

19:23.830 --> 19:27.066
* Take a look at me *

19:27.099 --> 19:31.304
* Tell me, do you like
what you see? *

19:31.338 --> 19:36.209
* Do you think you can *

19:36.243 --> 19:40.713
* Do you think you can do me? *

19:40.747 --> 19:45.518
* Kiss me, pretty baby *

19:45.552 --> 19:49.422
* Touch me all over *

19:49.456 --> 19:54.060
* Girl, what makes you think
you can do me? *

19:54.093 --> 19:58.064
* Do you think
you can do me, girl? *

19:58.097 --> 20:01.200
* Do me, baby *

20:01.234 --> 20:02.702
* Oh... *

20:02.735 --> 20:05.238
* Do me, baby *

20:05.272 --> 20:07.274
* Do you think you can *

20:07.307 --> 20:09.175
* Do me, baby *

20:09.208 --> 20:12.111
* Do me... *

20:12.144 --> 20:13.980
(Angel moaning softly)

20:17.417 --> 20:19.218
(gasps)

20:24.957 --> 20:29.762
I love you. I love you.

20:32.299 --> 20:36.135
I love you, too.
I love you, too.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.170
(moaning softly)

20:52.652 --> 20:53.920
(brakes screech)

20:57.457 --> 20:59.492
(grunts softly)

20:59.526 --> 21:03.162
Is there a Ritz-Carlton
or even a Marriott available?

21:03.195 --> 21:05.164
That is not in the budget.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.933
ACT UP gave us two rooms.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.669
One for the ladies
and one for the gentlemen.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.439
I call dibs on the most
comfortable bed.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.807
I pray I don't get scabies.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.743
All right, Elektra,
you do your entitled thing.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.346
The rest of us will make do
with our sleeping bags.

21:21.147 --> 21:23.115
You think they got room service
up in here?

21:23.149 --> 21:24.917
There's a vending machine
right here.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.619
Knock yourself out.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.956
Ooh. All right.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.491
-(clears throat)
-(sighs)

21:31.524 --> 21:33.360
So, I'm gonna take this bed
by the window

21:33.393 --> 21:36.262
and y'all can take the one
by the bathroom.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.164
-Uh-uh.
-Daddy needs her rest.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.466
-(clears throat)
-Mm-mm, mm-mm.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.534
I'm not sharing no bed with him.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.671
-Don't trust yourself?
-No, don't trust you, cheater.

21:44.704 --> 21:48.107
Maybe we can get you
a cot or something?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.877
I'll sleep on the cot,
but you got to go get it.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.311
Deal.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.386
(groans softly)

21:59.419 --> 22:01.821
(door closes)

22:01.854 --> 22:03.356
(Pray Tell humming)

22:03.390 --> 22:07.026
-Don't judge.
-(snickers)

22:07.059 --> 22:08.661
These are my creams
and moisturizers.

22:08.695 --> 22:11.831
My routine is the only thing
that keeps me sane.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.401
Damn, that's a lot of product,
Pray. (chuckles)

22:14.434 --> 22:16.636
(laughs)

22:16.669 --> 22:18.671
This your secret to looking
so good at your age?

22:18.705 --> 22:21.408
You complimenting me and
insulting me in the same breath?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.476
Nah, I ain't mean it like that.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.178
I'm just saying
you look good, that's all.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.415
Thank you.

22:28.448 --> 22:32.251
And yes,
this is my secret recipe.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.921
-Hmm.
-Skin is like leather.

22:34.954 --> 22:38.491
It must be moisturized
to remain supple.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.827
-I did not know that.
-(chuckles)

22:40.860 --> 22:43.596
It's funny, when I was your age,

22:43.630 --> 22:47.767
we had lots of older,
wiser men to look up to,

22:47.800 --> 22:50.570
aspire to.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.239
Now we're just
an endangered species.

22:53.272 --> 22:54.807
(sniffles)

23:02.549 --> 23:04.484
What's wrong with you?

23:06.486 --> 23:09.221
Um...

23:09.255 --> 23:13.726
I got a call from Chris
before we left today.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.296
-The one from the tour?
-Mm-hmm.

23:17.329 --> 23:21.434
He was crying, uh,
because he tested positive.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.938
That's terrible.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.608
Yeah.

23:28.641 --> 23:32.111
But you said you didn't
sleep with him.

23:32.144 --> 23:35.014
He just sucked my dick.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.585
Chris is a hungry bottom ho...

23:38.618 --> 23:40.953
Okay, okay. Enough of that.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.755
There's way too much
bottom-shaming

23:42.789 --> 23:45.658
going on in our community.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.260
Nothing wrong with a man
getting what he wants,

23:48.294 --> 23:50.763
-receiving intimacy.
-(exhales)

23:50.797 --> 23:53.500
(sighs, clears throat)

23:56.703 --> 23:58.471
You need to get tested.

23:58.505 --> 24:01.508
-Again?
-Yes, again.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.476
And it's not gonna be
the last time.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.445
And you need
to be honest with Damon.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.815
You have a responsibility.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.619
Listen,

24:12.652 --> 24:15.655
this is our life now.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.658
Remember this feeling.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.893
It'll help keep you responsible.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.363
(door opens)

24:26.799 --> 24:28.200
You two queens
gonna help or not?

24:28.234 --> 24:30.369
(Pray Tell laughs)

24:30.402 --> 24:32.972
-I will. I got it.
-I'm the elder, bitch.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.274
RICKY:
Just chill out. Don't-don't

24:35.307 --> 24:37.176
throw your back out.
(chuckles)

24:48.420 --> 24:50.757
(brakes screech)

24:55.061 --> 24:57.229
PRAY TELL:
All right, so we got 15 minutes

24:57.263 --> 24:58.698
to inflate this condom

24:58.731 --> 25:00.833
before the neighborhood watch
calls the po-po.

25:00.867 --> 25:04.470
Let's get to work.
No sauntering, children.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.405
-The news is here.
-I called them.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.240
TV stations love angry gays.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.843
No point doing this
if the world don't see it.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.079
Okay. So, what's the plan
for when five-o rolls up?

25:13.112 --> 25:14.513
Simple.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.749
-We take the fall.
-(scoffs) Oh, no,

25:16.783 --> 25:19.418
I am not posing for a mug shot
with that horrid lighting.

25:19.451 --> 25:22.689
We're the elders, Elektra.
Sacrifices must be made.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.223
-(laughs)
-(mocking laugh)

25:24.256 --> 25:25.725
-Bring your ass on...
-Get your ass over here.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.727
-Let's go.
-But...
-(mock stammers)

25:27.760 --> 25:30.262
-ELEKTRA: I am in heels.
-(Pray Tell laughing)
-BLANCA: Let's go.

25:33.966 --> 25:37.003
I think you need to stretch
that out just a little bit more.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.639
-You're not gonna help?
-It's very hot out here.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.143
LULU:
Clear down below!

25:49.448 --> 25:50.717
Does this come over the shrub?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.418
Yes, it must come
over the shrubs.

25:52.451 --> 25:53.686
That way it'll look better.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.955
Our hard work
is really paying off.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.423
She's trying to kill me.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.761
-(dog barking)
-NURSE JUDY: Uh-oh.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.395
Ah, shoot.
We got to distract her.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.031
You got the right bitch
for that.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.633
-Uh...
-Uh-oh.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.800
What's all this about?

26:07.834 --> 26:10.402
We're tenting for termites.

26:10.436 --> 26:13.973
-But don't worry, Frederica
knows all about it. We're close.
-(scoffs)

26:14.006 --> 26:15.908
I find that hard to believe.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.944
Just last week,
we had lunch at River Café,

26:17.977 --> 26:20.713
and she told me all about
how much she adores you.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.114
Now I know you're lying.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.883
She's the worst neighbor
I've ever had.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.886
That bitch can die in a fire.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.454
But I'm still calling the cops.

26:28.487 --> 26:29.922
Good, because you should be
arrested for showing yourself

26:29.956 --> 26:31.958
in that ratty old housedress.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.325
Now, run home, Wonder Bread.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.061
And take your ugly dog, too.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.163
This ain't
the Yellow Brick Road, bitch.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.799
(laughter)

26:39.832 --> 26:41.333
ELEKTRA:
What are you gawking at?

26:41.367 --> 26:43.069
Now get back to work.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.004
BLANCA:
It's the government,
it's churches...

26:45.037 --> 26:46.939
refuse to tell
the people the truth,

26:46.973 --> 26:48.941
that condoms
are the most effective way

26:48.975 --> 26:51.644
to prevent the spread
of HIV and AIDS.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.245
And what would you like
our audience

26:53.279 --> 26:56.348
to take away
from this unique protest?

26:56.382 --> 26:59.986
We're here,
and we ain't going nowhere.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.988
And if you think
that this disease

27:02.021 --> 27:05.591
ain't coming for you, too,
you're wrong.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.826
Exactly.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.295
You two make a good team.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.097
-(chuckles)
-BOTH: Thank you.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.965
We know it, sweetheart.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.533
-Ready!
-PRAY TELL: Ooh.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.869
Turn that camera back on.
The real show's about to start.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.038
All right, come on, y'all.
Get out here. Get out here now.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.540
(cheering, applause)

27:21.573 --> 27:23.375
(whooping)

27:23.409 --> 27:25.211
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.646
-Three...
-ALL: Two, one.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.215
(generator whirring)

27:29.248 --> 27:30.883
(whooping)

27:30.917 --> 27:33.853
-All right...
-Look at that.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.888
We did this, y'all.

27:35.922 --> 27:38.858
Can y'all believe
we made this happen?

27:38.891 --> 27:40.760
Lookee here, lookee here!

27:42.494 --> 27:43.996
See what happens when you put
your mind to it?

27:44.030 --> 27:46.032
BLANCA:
Baby, look at it rise, honey.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.967
-(cheering)
-RICKY: Oh, you like that?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.869
(laughter, applause)

27:49.902 --> 27:51.971
PRAY TELL:
Here she blows!

27:52.004 --> 27:54.473
-I'm impressed, I have to say.
-I'm impressed, too.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.977
I'm impressed.
Bravo, children. Bravo.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.713
-Yes, yeah.
-NURSE JUDY: Look at
this masterpiece.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.082
BLANCA:
You seen my mother's
cookbook anywhere?

28:03.115 --> 28:04.383
Oh, it's-it's in,
it's in my room.

28:04.416 --> 28:05.517
I was studying up
on those biscuits.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.054
-I'll be right back.
-Oh. Okay.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.091
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
-Yo, you ever heard
of knocking?

28:12.124 --> 28:14.193
Ooh-- oh, I didn't know
y'all were in here.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.595
-Relax.
-ANGEL: God...
-(vial drops)

28:16.628 --> 28:18.430
ANGEL:
You...

28:18.464 --> 28:19.665
-What the fuck is that, Angel?
-Nothing.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.933
-(sniffing)
-Don't be playing like

28:20.967 --> 28:22.935
I'm that naive.
I know what cocaine looks like.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.370
(shushing)

28:24.403 --> 28:27.273
You ain't seen nothing.
Shut your mouth.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.008
Get your hands off me.

28:29.041 --> 28:32.378
I'm sorry.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.881
Where the fuck did you get money
to afford blow?

28:34.914 --> 28:36.382
You know that shit is not cheap.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.050
It was a party favor.
We d-- we didn't,

28:38.084 --> 28:40.119
we didn't pay for--
we didn't pay for nothing.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.421
Just because it was free don't
mean it don't come at a cost.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.223
Now, you know Mother's rules.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.391
You know she don't play
about drugs.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.393
Papi, you of all people
should know that.

28:47.426 --> 28:51.630
Papo. Trust me,
it was nothing, man.

28:51.663 --> 28:53.199
We got caught up in the moment.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.634
A-Angel booked another
big campaign.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.237
-The new Bebe girl.
I'm the new Bebe girl.
-The new Bebe girl, man.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.571
-I'm the new Bebe girl.
-Come on.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.273
LIL PAPI:
We went out to celebrate,
and it was

29:01.307 --> 29:03.209
the first time we got to be
together as a legit couple.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.443
Exactly.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.913
Look, I'm happy for y'all,

29:06.946 --> 29:09.415
but if Blanca
catches a whiff of this,

29:09.448 --> 29:11.483
y'all gonna be buried
next to Candy.

29:11.517 --> 29:15.254
I know. That's why
you can't say nothing.

29:19.959 --> 29:23.262
You see? It's gone.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.564
-(vial shatters)
-All right, my lips are sealed.

29:25.597 --> 29:29.168
As long as you promise
you won't do that shit again.

29:29.201 --> 29:32.071
On my life, I promise.
Never again, man.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.406
-All right, now put some clothes
on. I done seen enough of you.
-Hey, come on, you know

29:34.440 --> 29:37.343
-you like what you see.
-Boy, get away from me.
(mutters)

29:37.376 --> 29:38.510
ANGEL:
So, wh-where were you?

29:38.544 --> 29:41.981
Oh, we wrapped Frederica's house
in a condom.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.516
Hold on, you-you're telling me
her house got AIDS or something?

29:44.550 --> 29:46.585
No, silly.
It was payback for the torment

29:46.618 --> 29:48.354
she put Mother under.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.457
Now, get dressed. I'll tell you
the whole story at dinner, okay?

29:53.225 --> 29:56.295
-(door closes)
-(sniffing)

29:56.328 --> 29:59.298
All right, all right, all right!
The grub is coming up!

29:59.331 --> 30:02.301
-Who ready to eat?
-(indistinct chatter)

30:02.334 --> 30:04.670
If this is not the best meal
that you've had,

30:04.703 --> 30:06.973
-I don't know what is.
-(excited chatter)

30:09.041 --> 30:11.477
Oh! All three of y'all cooked
that all by yourself?

30:11.510 --> 30:13.279
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
We had the help

30:13.312 --> 30:16.148
of Mother Blanca's recipe book
to guide us.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.450
It's looking like Chef Boyardee
went to work in that kitchen.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.620
Okay, boys, Lulu,
y'all done good.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.157
-Operation Condom Wrap
was a success.
-(applause)

30:25.191 --> 30:28.227
-RICKY: Good job, Lulu.
-Uh-huh. So, what's next?

30:28.260 --> 30:31.063
-Yeah, we want to do
another one.
-Well, that's up to y'all.

30:31.097 --> 30:33.832
But I will say that you first
should be focused on the things

30:33.866 --> 30:35.367
-that are coming...
-Hold up.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.870
Now, tonight's supposed
to be different.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.671
Tonight, we cooked
instead of Blanca,

30:39.705 --> 30:43.876
and tonight, we giving
the speech instead of Pray.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.677
PRAY TELL:
Oh...

30:45.711 --> 30:47.746
So, we're being schooled
on this evening?

30:47.779 --> 30:49.715
-RICKY: Just a little bit.
-PRAY TELL: Listen up.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.550
I just want to say thank you.

30:51.583 --> 30:55.354
You know, y'all saw that all of
us was struggling, falling down,

30:55.387 --> 30:57.356
and y'all could've
left us there.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.359
Or you could've picked us up,
but you gave us a chance

31:00.392 --> 31:03.229
to lift ourselves
up off the floor.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.596
-To learn something.
-And what was that?

31:04.630 --> 31:06.698
That there's a world
that is waiting

31:06.732 --> 31:08.234
for us to make our marks.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.102
LULU:
And a community,

31:10.136 --> 31:13.739
right here, waiting for us
to take the baton.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.008
Now, I don't know
what the ball's gonna look like

31:16.042 --> 31:18.077
in ten years, and God knows

31:18.110 --> 31:20.212
if any of us
gonna be here to see it.

31:20.246 --> 31:23.549
But whatever that future is,
it's gonna be managed by us.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.850
-(excited chatter)
-Okay?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.885
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

31:26.919 --> 31:28.687
RICKY:
I'll drink to that.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.322
-PRAY TELL: I'll drink to that.
-* Lovely day. *

31:37.096 --> 31:38.697
I was so happy to see you
up and running again.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.699
-No one does acrylics
like you, Blanca.
-Thank you, love.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.434
You know, my shady-ass landlord

31:42.468 --> 31:44.636
demanded the court
to rush our case.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.773
She was so sure she was gonna
win, but they ruled in my favor.

31:47.806 --> 31:50.542
Wait, so you beat
a rich white woman in court?

31:50.576 --> 31:52.711
Um, yes.
Sometimes right is right.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.713
-God bless the USA.
-(chuckles)

31:54.746 --> 31:57.516
-Keep the change.
-Ooh.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.225
Oh. You know what?

32:06.258 --> 32:09.228
I reserve the right
to refuse services to anyone,

32:09.261 --> 32:13.632
especially a homophobic, racist
witch who breaks contracts.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.801
I've been stiffed on payments,

32:15.834 --> 32:17.803
I've been double-crossed
on deals.

32:17.836 --> 32:19.738
That all comes
with the territory.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.674
But your assault on me,
my home, my reputation...

32:22.708 --> 32:24.743
Please, Frederica. You act like
the world didn't already know

32:24.776 --> 32:26.645
you was a stone-cold bitch.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.447
You basically bragged
about how hard you was

32:28.480 --> 32:29.948
the first day we met.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.484
This is different.
You humiliated me.

32:32.518 --> 32:35.154
Do you know how difficult it is
for a woman in real estate?

32:35.187 --> 32:36.855
Now they're laughing at me.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.625
And those Upper West Side
commies think I'm prejudiced.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.493
And all because of you.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.163
Good. Now, can you please leave
my establishment?

32:44.196 --> 32:47.099
Fine. I just came down here
to say congratulations, Blanca,

32:47.133 --> 32:48.600
or whatever your real name is.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.702
You won.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.205
I'm not easy to get the best of.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.307
I almost admire you.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.676
Underestimate me at your peril.

32:58.910 --> 33:01.013
Do be careful at night
when you leave here, though.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.314
This neighborhood
isn't improving

33:02.348 --> 33:03.815
as fast as I thought it would.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.351
Excuse me, is that a threat?

33:05.384 --> 33:07.386
You gonna send somebody
to bust my kneecaps?

33:07.419 --> 33:10.122
I'm just saying
that you should underestimate me

33:10.156 --> 33:13.825
at your peril, too, sweetheart.

33:13.859 --> 33:16.028
BLANCA:
So, next thing I know,

33:16.062 --> 33:17.896
she up and left. I mean,
she just hopped in her car

33:17.929 --> 33:19.165
and sped away.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.200
I can't believe we won.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.502
Ugh.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.871
Ew, what?

33:25.904 --> 33:27.873
I'm just proud of you, girl.

33:27.906 --> 33:33.679
We needed a win,
especially after... you know.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.681
Well, how are you holding up?

33:35.714 --> 33:38.684
I'm okay. I'm better.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.319
Hey.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.154
I appreciate
what you've done for me.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.689
For real.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.892
Candy's death
really fucked me up, girl.

33:46.925 --> 33:50.729
I was feeling lost
before she died.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.599
I've never been great
expressing my feelings.

33:53.632 --> 33:57.403
Losing Candy just...
made it worse.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.672
But there you were
to lift me up.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.342
-I'm getting back to good.
-I'm happy to hear that.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.377
Shit, I see what you've done.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.379
Your kids are taken care of.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.749
You got a great house.
Shit, you've got a business now.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.751
Girl, please do not be fooled.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.754
-None of this has been easy.
-Happiness don't come easy.

34:15.787 --> 34:18.857
Which is why

34:18.890 --> 34:22.561
I've... enrolled into
the Bronx Community College.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.862
-I'm gonna get
my accounting degree, girl.
-What?!

34:23.895 --> 34:26.898
-(laughs)
-Yo, Lulu, I am so proud of you.

34:26.932 --> 34:30.469
Yo, I got dreams, too. I figured
I'd make them a reality.

34:34.473 --> 34:38.477
Thank you for inspiring me.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.147
And for pulling me out the dark.

34:45.651 --> 34:48.220
We've been here an hour.

34:48.254 --> 34:51.223
You sure it's been
the whole ten days?

34:51.257 --> 34:52.991
I'm sure.
They called me yesterday

34:53.024 --> 34:55.527
and told me to come in here.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.101
This is the first time
I've been tested

35:03.135 --> 35:06.805
without having Damon
to hold my hand through it.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.913
It's all right.

35:14.946 --> 35:19.185
This is what being an adult
looks like.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.986
Ain't no different
than paying your electric bill

35:21.019 --> 35:25.023
or doing your taxes.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.692
I ain't never done taxes.

35:26.725 --> 35:30.028
Do I have to teach
you children everything?

35:30.061 --> 35:32.030
(chuckles softly)

35:32.063 --> 35:35.767
Maybe so... Daddy.

35:35.801 --> 35:40.506
Bitch, I may be your elder,
but I ain't your daddy.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.175
Well, what if I'm into daddies?

35:43.209 --> 35:48.180
(exhales) It gets real muggy
in these waiting rooms.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.982
(door opens)

35:51.016 --> 35:54.486
NURSE:
60918?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.488
That's me.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.990
Go in there and be strong.

35:59.024 --> 36:02.661
I'll be waiting for you
when you get out.

36:05.197 --> 36:08.900
Gay male,
birthday June 22, 1967?

36:08.934 --> 36:10.736
Yep.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.239
It says here that the test
came back positive.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.807
Do you have
a general practitioner,

36:15.841 --> 36:18.344
or will you be needing
a recommendation for a doctor?

36:18.377 --> 36:20.178
-Wh-What?
-We'll also need a list

36:20.212 --> 36:22.248
of all your sexual partners
with their phone numbers

36:22.281 --> 36:25.751
-so that we can contact them.
-Uh, hold on, um...

36:25.784 --> 36:27.486
What are you saying?

36:27.519 --> 36:30.356
You are HIV-positive.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.658
Were you expecting
a different result?

36:32.691 --> 36:34.260
Of course I was.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.262
In your questionnaire,
you stated that you had

36:36.295 --> 36:39.531
multiple same-sex partners,
and that you rarely use condoms.

36:39.565 --> 36:43.201
Well, yes, but... No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:43.235 --> 36:45.103
No, no, no.
Uh, run the test again.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.538
-We've run it twice.
-I ain't never had no fevers,

36:46.572 --> 36:49.007
no night sweats or nothing.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.911
Not all patients experience
the symptoms of seroconversion.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.981
(scoffs)

37:07.326 --> 37:10.095
(sniffles)
So, that's it?

37:13.299 --> 37:15.133
(sniffles)

37:20.639 --> 37:23.108
(door closes)

37:23.141 --> 37:25.110
(exhales)

37:25.143 --> 37:27.112
Baby, I'm so sorry.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.148
(sniffles)

37:30.181 --> 37:31.483
I'm gonna die.

37:33.319 --> 37:34.920
-I'm gonna die, Pray...
-No. No, you're not.

37:34.953 --> 37:38.490
No, you're not. No, you're not.

37:43.329 --> 37:45.331
(crying)

37:49.368 --> 37:53.939
I got you, I got you, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.974
It's okay.

38:08.153 --> 38:10.556
MISS FORD:
She didn't get in the car?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.592
What time is it?

38:13.625 --> 38:15.394
9:15, ma'am.

38:17.463 --> 38:19.565
Her call time was 7:30.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.773
You're late.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.176
Two hours, to be exact.

38:31.209 --> 38:34.212
-And you look like shit.
-(mutters) Damn.

38:34.245 --> 38:36.281
Good morning to you, too,
Miss-- Miss Ford.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.516
Are you hungover?

38:37.549 --> 38:39.317
Why would you party

38:39.351 --> 38:42.488
the night before
your most important shoot?

38:42.521 --> 38:45.123
This-this is Bebe.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.725
I'm sorry to interrupt.
How you doing, Miss Ford?

38:46.758 --> 38:48.560
I'm Esteban, Angel's boyfriend.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.396
I just wanted to say
I also appreciate everything

38:50.429 --> 38:52.197
-you've done to help Angel.
-Esteban,

38:52.230 --> 38:53.699
I've heard lovely things
about you,

38:53.732 --> 38:55.333
but can I take it from here?

38:55.367 --> 38:57.536
Of course.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.405
Break legs, mm-hmm?

39:03.208 --> 39:04.610
(clears throat)

39:05.877 --> 39:07.846
Oh, you want me
to g go. Yeah.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.382
Yeah.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.617
I'll be outside.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.820
(door opens)

39:14.853 --> 39:18.056
You see all of this?

39:18.089 --> 39:19.825
-This is for you.
-Ow.

39:19.858 --> 39:24.930
Everyone here is here for you.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.532
You are the star...

39:27.866 --> 39:31.102

39:34.139 --> 39:36.374
I don't care
to know the particulars

39:36.408 --> 39:40.412
of your nighttime activities
in the Bronx,

39:40.446 --> 39:42.681
but you are better than this.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.917
-You don't know me.
-(chuckles) Darling girl.

39:45.951 --> 39:50.088
Haven't we done
this routine before?

39:50.121 --> 39:53.191
I've been doing this
longer than you've lived.

39:53.224 --> 39:57.028
And I've seen bright
and shining stars like you

39:57.062 --> 39:58.564
dim their own light.

39:58.597 --> 40:01.099
You're so close to having

40:01.132 --> 40:06.171
everything you told me
you wanted, Angel.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.780
Do you want to burn out, too?

40:23.421 --> 40:26.091
Maddy, fetch the photographer.

40:26.124 --> 40:29.127
Hair and makeup, you know
what you guys have to do.
