KNOCK ON DOOR

00:37.320 --> 00:38.840
HE GIGGLES

00:38.840 --> 00:40.720
It's open. Clockwork.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.080
VICTOR WHISTLES

00:44.080 --> 00:46.960
Top of the morning, Jack boy.
Aye, morning, Victor.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.360
A wee bit nippy out there.
Is it? Aye.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.760
What's happening?
"What's happening?"

00:59.760 --> 01:02.080
Oh, give us a chance, Jack,
I've no' looked at the paper yet.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.519
No, the other paper.
My paper to read.

01:04.519 --> 01:05.840
Oh, I just got the one.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.800
That's no' how it works.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.160
One of us does the rolls, the
Penguins and the teas, and the

01:10.160 --> 01:12.880
other one jumps down to the shop,
gets two different newspapers,

01:12.880 --> 01:15.120
we read them, then we swap them.
Aye, but the two papers

01:15.120 --> 01:18.040
had the same headline, they put the
cost of the papers up...

01:18.040 --> 01:19.720
One will do us, eh?

01:19.720 --> 01:22.000
I'll read this,
then I'll give it to you.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.520
Jeezo, didn't see that coming.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.440
Ooft.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.080
That's a surprise.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.240
HE GASPS
He's no' dead, is he?

01:32.240 --> 01:33.560
Let me get this straight.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.040
You get to sit there and
get the news first-hand,

01:36.040 --> 01:38.760
while I've to sit here
with no news, like a daftie?

01:38.760 --> 01:40.200
Completely oot of the loop.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.720
A caveman, a Cro-Magnon.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.400
Put the telly on or something.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.680
Of course, they didn't have telly
back in Cro-Magnon times, did they?

01:47.680 --> 01:50.080
Make a fire or whatever
it is you people dae.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.280
Do you want the paper?

01:57.280 --> 01:59.920
No. Just give me that wee magazine
they always stick in the middle.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.960
I like that.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.080
HE IMITATES A CAVEMAN:
Magazine, gift.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.560
Good pictures.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.199
I will fashion a spear
and stick it up your arse.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.960
HE IMITATES A CAVEMAN:
Make eyes water.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.280
Ah, the Futuroo magazine,
I love this.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.600
Full of clever stuff
that you can only buy in the shops.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.960
Oh, a thermal cup.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.600
"Keep your cuppa piping hot."

02:23.600 --> 02:25.480
I don't see the
benefit of that, Jack.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.720
Oh, well, make a cup of tea,
you go to get a biscuit,

02:27.720 --> 02:29.680
you fall, you snap your leg.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.240
You're up the hospital,
lying on a gurney.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.920
Four hours - ignored.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.920
So then you're back doon the road
again, gasping for a cup of tea,

02:37.920 --> 02:40.160
greetin' with the pain.
Tea, tea, tea!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.960
And then you're like that,
"Oh, hello!"

02:41.960 --> 02:45.080
Roasting hot cup of tea on the
sideboard, just where I left it.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.040
Oh, that is a handy thing, aye.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.880
Bad fracture, nice hot cup of tea.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.120
Oh, it's the shite you get as well.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.000
Oh, dear. The Eggmaster 3000.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.800
This is aimed at the wankers, aye.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.240
You put eggs in it at night
before you go to bed.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.520
Uh-huh? And when you wake up
in the morning,

03:01.520 --> 03:03.840
they're boiled, ready for you.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.240
If you order it before the end
of the month,

03:06.240 --> 03:08.960
you qualify for a
toasty soldier companion.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.880
Gee us a look at that, Jack.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.640
No. I'll read it first and
then I'll gee it to you.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.320
Eggmaster 3000.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.600
What sort of windae licker would
stump up the cash for that, eh?

03:21.600 --> 03:24.200
Yes, the Eggmaster 3000, please.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.520
Am I still eligible for
the toasty soldier companion?

03:33.040 --> 03:34.280
You dancing bear!

03:35.480 --> 03:37.360
No, that's great.
Thanking you.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.480
Would I like expedited delivery?

03:42.520 --> 03:45.560
Um, what does expedited mean?

03:45.560 --> 03:46.680
Quicker?

03:46.680 --> 03:47.960
Oh, aye, hen.

Is that your signature, aye?

04:07.240 --> 04:10.200
Yes. Same as it's always been.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.800
Yingamee-yingam-yingam!

04:18.920 --> 04:19.959
Oh, dear.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.480
Better get the hoover out.

04:27.040 --> 04:32.600
# You and me are
always meant to be. #

04:34.040 --> 04:38.200
Isa. You know, I never
give you anything.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.600
How do you mean, Navid?

04:42.040 --> 04:44.040
Eh?

04:44.040 --> 04:46.320
Eh? A mop?!

04:46.320 --> 04:47.960
Not just any mop.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.520
I've got you something from
the Futuroo catalogue.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.560
This is the Floor Hero.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.760
I'm no' needing that, Navid.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.560
I like my string mop.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.840
Oh, come on, Isa.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.120
This looks like it's had chemo.

05:04.480 --> 05:08.080
And anyway, the Floor Hero
gives you Bluetooth.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.720
Bluetooth?

05:09.720 --> 05:12.000
It's normally just Dettol I use.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.160
Dear, oh, dear, Isa.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.320
Bluetooth gives you wireless music.

05:17.320 --> 05:21.600
Wireless? And it makes your
mopping a whole lot easier,

05:21.600 --> 05:24.680
because music makes a
chore pass much quicker.

Eh?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.720
Ah!

05:55.720 --> 05:57.920

normally get a wee one.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.080
Oh, a dozen eggs, no' six,

06:25.080 --> 06:28.080
and quilted toilet roll.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.920
You usually buy the cheap stuff that
you put your fingers through.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.000
You've got a house guest visiting.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.400
I'm asking when.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.240
Scary. See you, Isa...

06:40.320 --> 06:42.000
..you should grow a moustache.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.680
Well, a thicker one.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.160
And get it all waxed up
at the ends, eh?

06:46.160 --> 06:48.200
Get yourself a job mopping up on
the Orient Express,

06:48.200 --> 06:49.440

06:53.360 --> 06:54.800
Spider catcher.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.440

06:56.440 --> 06:57.880

06:57.880 --> 06:59.720
Boom! Batter it with a slipper.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.840
20 quid saved.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.200

07:05.200 --> 07:08.520
"That'll make my meaningless
life easier!"

07:08.520 --> 07:12.160
"Oh, this'll keep me out the
grave for another 15 minutes."

07:13.720 --> 07:14.880
Look at this.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.720
An electric bonnet.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.440
"Outsmart Jack Frost this
winter with a hot cap."

07:20.440 --> 07:22.080
Shite.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.760
No' shite, Bobby. Toasty.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.600
And it came the day.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.040
In there, there's a new PP3 battery

07:29.040 --> 07:31.920
and the liner is like
a mini electric blanket.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.280
Wait, wait.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.320
There you go.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.840
It's kicking in noo.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.800
Do you want a drink or no?
I'll take a pint of cider.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.960
A pint of ice, Bobby.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.720
I'm sweating like
Pavarotti's pallbearer.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.720
Oh, look who it is!

07:50.720 --> 07:52.280

07:52.280 --> 07:54.640
That's right, you put

07:54.640 --> 07:55.920
Two pints, prick.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.080
That's no' Winston.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.320
Walter! Walter.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.560
Hey.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.200
Long time no see.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.080
It must've been how long?

08:09.080 --> 08:11.720
Oh, let me think now.
15 year?

08:11.720 --> 08:12.840
Have you seen Winston yet?

08:12.840 --> 08:15.120
No. No, I thought I'd jump in
for a quick pint

08:15.120 --> 08:16.680
before I go over to see him.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.120
Winston!

08:18.120 --> 08:19.400
What you like, eh?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.480
In here entertaining
the troops before you come

08:21.480 --> 08:24.120
and visit your brother.
A drink for my brother!

08:24.120 --> 08:26.080
In fact, get one for everybody.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.440
Nice. Good, aye.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.400
Here, what happened to your leg?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
Eh? Oh, I lost it.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.360
Fags. Oh, dear.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.080
Anyway, how you been?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.120
Aye.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.640
What happened to your arm?

08:39.640 --> 08:41.799
Oh, I lost it. Rigs.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.840
Well, where have you been?
Where have I no' been?!

08:44.840 --> 08:47.800
I was over in that
Heimdal gas field there.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.760
Aye. Got transferred over to...

08:49.760 --> 08:51.080
SNORING

08:51.080 --> 08:53.400
Oh, here! Stop me if I'm boring you!

08:53.400 --> 08:55.080
No, no, you're no' boring him.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.720
It's the battery bonnets,
puts him to sleep.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.640
Eric! Wake up, you old tit!

09:00.640 --> 09:01.840
Oh!

09:03.000 --> 09:05.800
Argh! It's absolutely roasting!

09:07.720 --> 09:09.200
Whoa!

09:11.560 --> 09:13.280
My good bonnet!

09:13.280 --> 09:15.040

09:47.760 --> 09:49.600

09:49.600 --> 09:51.040
That's very funny, Chris.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.600
Have you got anything for us?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.600
I have, as it happens.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.400
I've got one for each of you.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.320
Ooh, here! Hee-hee!

09:58.320 --> 09:59.520
Nice one, Chris.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.000
Oh, all different sizes!

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
A wee gadget for each of us, eh?

10:05.000 --> 10:08.480
Something to make life that
bit easier.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.800
Who's going to kick things off?

10:10.800 --> 10:12.120
Allow me.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.440
Oh!

10:15.440 --> 10:16.800
A stone?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.160
At first glance.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.200
Observe.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.440
What's the good of that?

10:29.440 --> 10:31.480
Well, let's say
I come home one night

10:31.480 --> 10:34.560
after a convivial evening in the
Clansman and I can't find my keys

10:34.560 --> 10:36.920
because I'm, you know, pished
and what have you.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.840
Boom! I've got a set right here.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.320
Disguised as a common garden pebble.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.640
Which would not look out of place in
a garden, but this is a landing.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.400
Oh, aye. Aye, I mean, see a
robber would see that

10:51.400 --> 10:54.080
and say, "Oh, that's one of
they wee Futuroo hide your keys

10:54.080 --> 10:56.720
"in a pebble things. That'll save me
from kicking the

10:56.720 --> 10:58.800
"old guy's door in."

10:58.800 --> 11:00.840
Shut up! Looks good there.

11:00.840 --> 11:04.280
Like a rockery. Nah, it's only a
start on a rockery.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.560
It's like a one rock rockery.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.280
It's like a shitey rockery.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.240
Aye, you should get
doon the garden centre,

11:11.240 --> 11:13.680
get more rocks to put
round aboot it.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.040
Wait till you see.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.520
Hold that.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.360
Hey-hey!

11:21.360 --> 11:22.480
Watch.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.520
Put it there.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.560
Chap my door!

11:33.400 --> 11:34.920
Who is it, please?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.560
Victor McDade and Jack Jarvis.

11:40.560 --> 11:44.800
Er, Esquire. I'm sorry, I cannot
come to the door the noo

11:44.800 --> 11:49.200
for I'm making cock-a-leekie soup,
so bugger off!

11:49.200 --> 11:50.880
It's a good wee thing that.
I like it.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.360
It's a nice wee thing, that. I'd
like to get one of them, yeah.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.640
Right, come in and show me what
you've got, Jack.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.040
DOOR SHUTS

11:57.040 --> 11:58.440
Jack?

11:58.440 --> 11:59.640
Jack?

11:59.640 --> 12:00.680
Jack! Victor!

12:03.840 --> 12:06.040
That is the bollocks. Mm-hm.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.920
The business. The daddy of them all.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.800
What the hell is it?
What's your bath time routine?

12:11.800 --> 12:13.920
I don't take a bath routinely.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.040
Too much hassle. I do my ablutions
with my shower head.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.960
Ablutions? Aye, roond the hooses.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.800
Oxsters, arsehole, clackerbag.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.800
Thanks for that, Victor. I've now
got that in Panavision.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.560
I know what you mean though,
I'm the same.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.120
Normally a bath at our age is a pain
in the arse,

12:29.120 --> 12:31.800
but with the techno tub, no siree.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.960
Soap dispenser.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.600
Beer holder.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.040
Thermometer.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.080
Light.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.080
Book stand.
And the piece de resistance...

12:42.080 --> 12:44.000
MUSIC PLAYS

12:44.000 --> 12:45.440
Mm-hm.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.840
And with that,
bath time is a pleasure

12:47.840 --> 12:49.880
and I will be having one tonight.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.280
Nice. How much was that?

12:52.280 --> 12:55.280
34.99. That's better than
a dummy stone, right enough.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.560
OK, once you've used that tonight,

12:58.560 --> 13:01.120
I'll get a shot of it and have a
good steep myself.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.520
No, no, no, no, no.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.000
The techno tub's a personal thing.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.200
That would be like borrowing
another man's sponge.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.320
No, no, away you go
and fondle your stone.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.680
HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER

13:14.680 --> 13:17.440
He turns round and goes,
"No, you hold its heed,

13:17.440 --> 13:19.360
"I'll put the wellies on it!"

13:21.840 --> 13:24.080
What am I missing here? What's all
the laughing about?

13:24.080 --> 13:25.720
My ribs are sore!

13:25.720 --> 13:28.880
It's Walter here. He should be
a bloody stand-up comedian.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.600
Hey, you can be a double act.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.920
Winston, you'd need to be the
straight man.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.680
Or the clown that comes oot
before the main event!

13:38.080 --> 13:40.280
Cos he's it and you're shit.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.080
That could be the name of
your double act.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.640
Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand -

13:43.640 --> 13:46.920
oh, no offence, Walter -
for It and Shit!

13:48.800 --> 13:50.200
Thanks for that, Jack.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.520
Right, where are we going?

13:51.520 --> 13:53.840
The bookies? Let's flash some cash.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.640
No, no.
Stevie the bookie's a wrong 'un.

13:56.640 --> 13:57.960
How?

13:57.960 --> 13:59.560
It's a long story.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.960
What about the greyhounds?

14:00.960 --> 14:03.120
Where's Victor?
Oh, he's up the garden centre.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.480
He's buying bloody pebbles.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.760
What for? He's a crackpot.

14:06.760 --> 14:10.200
Are you coming with us? No,
I'm going up the road for a bath.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.440
I've not had a bath for two years.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.840
No, no, no, I've had showers
and that. No,

14:14.840 --> 14:18.000
away yous go and enjoy yourself.
Have a nice one.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.520
Oh, you're filling up lovely.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.800
Oh, temperature.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.640
Tickety-boo.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.480
Oh, book stand.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.240
CLASSICAL MUSIC
Lovely.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.760
Oh! Ho-ho!

14:51.760 --> 14:54.280
Well, I'll be getting
in to you shortly

14:54.280 --> 14:56.400
and I don't know
when I'm getting out.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.440
16 quid for this pile of shit.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.640
KNOCKING
Victor.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.440
Victor.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.360
Jack. Help.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.560
Have you fell?
No, I'm stuck in the bath.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.480
I've been in here all night. What?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.520
'What's all the commotion?'

15:25.680 --> 15:27.760
KNOCKING
Isa, Jack's stuck in the bath.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.760
'Who's calling?' It's Victor.
Open the door.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.920
'I'm sorry, I cannot
receive guests at the moment,

15:33.920 --> 15:38.560
'for I'm in my dressing gown, eating
my toast, reading Bella magazine.'

15:39.640 --> 15:43.000
Listen to me, you halfwit!
Open the bloody door.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.880
Jack is stuck in the bath.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.200
If you don't open
this bloody door now,

15:47.200 --> 15:49.520
I'm going to rip this dog's
legs off.

15:53.360 --> 15:58.040
It's locked. Well, put your shoulder
to it.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.080
Ooh!

16:10.200 --> 16:12.720
Move!

16:12.720 --> 16:14.880
Hiya-huh!

16:16.320 --> 16:19.880
Are you all right, Jack?
What happened here? What happened?

16:19.880 --> 16:22.680
Well, I thought this bath is so
good, I'll live in it.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.640
I'm stuck. I can't get out.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.720
Jack, your willy!

16:28.120 --> 16:31.440
Oh, I'll cover that up, Jack.
Bigger towel!

16:33.760 --> 16:37.040
Who the bloody hell takes a bath
first thing in the morning?

16:37.040 --> 16:39.920
I took it last night. And you took
another one this morning?

16:39.920 --> 16:42.800
I've been in here since last night.
Last night? Oh, my!

16:42.800 --> 16:45.440
Oh, it's a carry on, isn't it?
Look at my skin.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.840
I'm turning into
Judy Finnigan.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.880
You canny just lift yourself out?
No, I'm stuck to the sides.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.200
It's like... I don't know, suction.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.160
Well, just pull the plug out.
Do you no' think I've tried that?

16:56.160 --> 16:58.960
It doesnae work. The plug's located
directly below my ringer.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.360
Don't panic. Panic?
Oh, I'm way beyond panicking.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.640
I was panicking for about ten hours,
but that's passed now.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.640
Call 911.
What for? The American cops?

17:09.640 --> 17:11.440
Away you go, you dunderhead.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.640
"Hello, is that CSI Miami?
My pal's stuck in the bath."

17:14.640 --> 17:17.280
"Where?" "Glesga."
It's 999 you call.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.400
I'm no' dying, I just want to get
out the bath.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.040
There's a number you call when
you've got trouble with a bath.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.560
B&Q. Shut up!
I know what it is, it's 101.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.720
No, that's crime.
I'm no' being robbed.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.440
No, the only thing I'm being robbed
of is my dignity.

17:32.440 --> 17:36.560
I know what it is. This happened
to big Janice McCafferty,

17:36.560 --> 17:38.240
her with the eating disorder.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.280
Oh, you know who I'm talking about.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.120
She got banned from Greggs
for grazing.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.360
She got stuck in the bath and her
man called...

17:46.360 --> 17:48.200
Her man called? Her man called?

17:48.200 --> 17:51.000
Kenny. No, the number he called,
you dozy cow.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.960
NHS Ambulance Services.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.000
That's who you call.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.080
Navid.
Meet my brother, Walter.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.120
Nice to see you.
What can I do you for?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.160
Cigars. What have you got?

18:09.160 --> 18:12.120
Well, we have classy ones for the
men about town

18:12.120 --> 18:15.560
and the not-so-classy
ones for the man about scheme.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.880
Classy, always classy.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.200
I used to be a half Corona man
myself,

18:21.200 --> 18:24.920
back when we were in Gujarat.
I know Gujarat. You know Gujarat?

18:24.920 --> 18:27.800
Oh, aye. I worked in Lahore
for long enough.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.160
The boy I worked with was from
Gujarat.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.440
Aftab Jarwar.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.720
He was a good laugh.
Tiny wee fella.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.320
Must have only been
about four foot six.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.400
THEY LAUGH

18:54.440 --> 18:56.600
That's a cracker. Take that.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.520
That's a better laugh
than he's ever gave me.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.160
Very kind, thanking you.

19:01.160 --> 19:06.280
So, have you ever been anywhere
good, Winston? Aye, Rawalpindi.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.240
Oh, in the Punjab region? No, in the
Sauchiehall Street region.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.360
Right next to the dry cleaners.
Good pakora.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.480
GIGGLES NERVOUSLY

19:21.120 --> 19:23.480
What the hell are you doing?
Sorry, Jack.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.480
I've been putting it off for ages.

19:26.480 --> 19:30.200
I've had to park a loaf in your
lavvy. You animal.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.360
Who does that? You only live
next door.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.760
Ah, I couldn't leave you by yourself
in the bath.

19:34.760 --> 19:38.520
You've been asleep. You could have
done a Whitney Houston.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.920
When are these people coming
to get me out of here?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.520
It's been nearly two hours
since we found you.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.495
They must be due here now.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.120
Well, if they show up now they're
going to be confused, aren't they?

19:47.120 --> 19:49.600
"Oh, dearie me, what a dilemma.
Who do we save first?

19:49.600 --> 19:53.920
"The old fella in the bath or the daft
old duffer superglued to the shiter?"

19:53.920 --> 19:56.560
Finish your manky business
and get off my pan.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.920
Look away.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.520
Oh, you must be from the services.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.320
No, no, that's John
from down the stair.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.560
Hi, John. What's going on here?
Well, he's stuck in the bath, son.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.680
Oh, are you? Well, I have water
coming down into my bathroom,

20:16.680 --> 20:19.280
which I've been doing up for the
past three months

20:19.280 --> 20:23.760
and I've just finished only to look
up and see drip, drip, drip, drip.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.800
Let me take a look at it.

20:27.200 --> 20:31.120
Oh, look at that.
That's soaking, rotten.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.560
I told you about that two years ago.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.640
Keep the heid, son,
there's an ambulance coming.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.920
If I get any more water
coming down on me,

20:37.920 --> 20:39.960
it'll be a hearse you're needing.

20:39.960 --> 20:44.520
Charming. Where are these toe rags?
Are they no' here yet?

20:44.520 --> 20:47.960
Typical, isn't it?
Leaving an old man stuck in a bath.

20:47.960 --> 20:51.720
It's disgusting. It's because the
pensioner isn't a priority.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.400
Aye, that's it, dirty, lazy pigs.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.840
We're the bottom of the pile,
make no mistake.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.840
How long did they say they'd be?
Who? The services.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.880
What did they say?

21:02.880 --> 21:05.840
What did they say to me?
Aye, when you phoned them.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.120
I never phoned them, it was Victor
that phoned them.

21:08.120 --> 21:12.000
I was in there getting ready.
You daft couple of arseholes!

21:13.160 --> 21:15.280
Victor. Yes, Jack.

21:15.280 --> 21:17.280
Flush.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.520
Come on, then. Get up.
Come on, then. Oh, you...

21:26.520 --> 21:28.240
Bingo!

21:28.240 --> 21:31.000
Beat by a bawhair.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.320
Excuse me a minute, sir, if I could
just tend to this customer first.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.360
Of course.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.960
Just ignore him, Walter.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.040
How can I help you?
Wee accumulator came up there.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.080
Nice. Let me see.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.800
You started with £1.

21:55.800 --> 22:01.440
You predicted McPherson in round
three last night, score draw next,

22:01.440 --> 22:04.680
the winner at Hamilton.
And you never took the odds.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.800
That was clever. £210.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.800
Well done.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.840
How about me buying you a pint

22:14.840 --> 22:16.920
and picking your brains
about your process?

22:16.920 --> 22:19.880
Any time. Aye, any time.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.840
No, I was referring
to the winner's enclosure.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.920
Winston.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.760
You're not taking a dump and all,
are you?

22:37.760 --> 22:40.880
Indeed I am not. Filthy pig.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.560
What did they say?
Ah, you're not going to like it.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.640
They said it could be
up to six hours.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.960
No. I cannae go another six hours.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.320
The water's starting to get cold,
you know?

22:51.320 --> 22:53.680
Well, we can fix that
with a wee top up.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.000
It's not coming.
Isa, please.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.720
Ah! Away you go, you halfwit!

23:08.720 --> 23:11.720
What have you done?
That's scalding hot, that!

23:11.720 --> 23:14.480
That's too much.
Oh, it's absolutely roasting.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.960
You may as well put potatoes
in here.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.840
My balls are getting poached.

23:18.840 --> 23:21.560
It's now or never, Jack. Victor!

23:21.560 --> 23:25.160
Are you ready? One, two, three.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.280
GROANS

23:28.280 --> 23:30.480
THEY SHOUT

23:30.480 --> 23:33.080
Get off me!

23:39.800 --> 23:41.640
Victor, are you all right?

23:45.680 --> 23:47.880
That's a good gang of pals you've
got here, Winston.

23:47.880 --> 23:51.280
Oh, aye. I'm really lucky.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.280
Jack, Victor, Tam, Eric...

23:55.640 --> 23:57.680
..Isa, Navid.
CLEARS THROAT

23:58.760 --> 24:01.320
Oh, and Stevie the bookie.

24:04.440 --> 24:08.160
That was awful news about poor old
Auntie Lily dying, wasn't it?

24:10.560 --> 24:14.240
And there it is. There what is?
The reason for your wee visit.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.480
Your bus leaves in an hour,
but there's still one last

24:18.480 --> 24:20.560
wee bit of business
to take care of, isn't there?

24:21.640 --> 24:25.280
The bite. I don't know what you're
talking about.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.920
I've warned you.
My ceiling is soaking now.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.000
How can you still be stuck? It's a
hell of a carry on, right enough.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.640
I mean, they're saying on the phone
it could be up to six hours.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.160
Oh, shut up, I'm not wanting your
life story, you daft old trout.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.200
Have you any Fairy Liquid?

24:40.320 --> 24:42.040
In my kitchen, under the sink.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.720
What's he going to do with
Fairy Liquid, Jack?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.920
I don't know, maybe wants
to do a couple of dishes?

24:48.920 --> 24:52.200
Calm himself down a bit.
Oh, like therapy that, isn't it?

24:52.200 --> 24:55.480
Anger management.
Right, out the road.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.400
Oh, my.

25:07.720 --> 25:13.440
This is the letter that I got
telling me Lily had passed.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.960
As soon as that arrived,
I knew you wouldn't be long

25:16.960 --> 25:19.920
at the back of it because
that's how you operate.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.520
Four times in the last 40 years
I've seen you.

25:25.520 --> 25:29.640
Each time to borrow money,
which you never paid back.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.960
You never even came to
your ma or your dad's funeral

25:33.960 --> 25:36.080
because you knew they
had nothing.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.080
So, was there any...

25:43.080 --> 25:44.960
Money?

25:44.960 --> 25:47.800
Aye, she left 4,000.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.200
So that's 2,000 each? No.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.520
Take the lot.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.400
Aye.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.400
I really am sorry for letting
all that water down in your new

26:15.400 --> 26:19.000
bathroom, but I was stuck in that
bath for 20 hours.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.480
Well, what are you doing taking
a bath at your age?

26:21.480 --> 26:24.760
Ah, well, he normally takes a
shower, but he bought this, see?

26:24.760 --> 26:27.120
Well, what is it?
Oh, that's the Techno Tub.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.440
It's got everything.
Radio, lights, thermometer.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.960
Aye, it's a good thing.
Well, what do you do with it?

26:31.960 --> 26:34.000
Well, it just sits like this.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.240
Voila.
CRASHING

26:42.840 --> 26:46.080
Techno Tub. Bath tidy.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.120
Your bathroom really is lovely.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.120
Is that a new shower cubicle?

27:28.040 --> 27:30.920
That must be weird for you, eh,
Winston?

27:30.920 --> 27:33.120
How so? Well, you know.

27:33.120 --> 27:36.000
Having an older brother
that's the life and soul and...

27:36.000 --> 27:38.640
Funnier than me? ALL: No!

27:38.640 --> 27:42.200
Look, ye cannae be jealous
of family.

27:42.200 --> 27:47.720
Anyway, he's away now. So you'll
have to put up with the support act.

27:47.720 --> 27:51.960
Winston, over the last couple of
days, Walter ran up a tab here.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.000
£40.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.600
Calm down. He telt me about that.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.200
He gave me this to square you up.

28:04.200 --> 28:08.680
Did you think he'd done a runner?
No. That's great.

28:08.680 --> 28:13.840
Right, everybody. To Walter.
ALL: To Walter.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.040
To Walter.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.640
Still nae joy? Which one was it?

28:24.600 --> 28:28.240
'Want me to make up the couch?
Hee-hee!'
