WEBVTT

00:01.450 --> 00:03.450
You're too long
in Brittany, Henry Tudor.

00:03.450 --> 00:06.010
I can only beat what
you put in front of me, Uncle.

00:06.010 --> 00:08.170
HE GROANS AND COUGHS

00:08.170 --> 00:09.490
The King is dead.

00:09.490 --> 00:11.330
We must be ready to raise an army.

00:11.330 --> 00:14.730
I will work with all of you
to put Prince Edward on the throne.

00:14.730 --> 00:17.490
We're to escort the King to the
Tower for his protection.

00:17.490 --> 00:19.370
Secure the Prince's safety.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.730
How dare he terrorise my sons?!

00:21.730 --> 00:23.250
We're going into sanctuary.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.650
What's stopping him
from snatching my other son?

00:25.650 --> 00:28.810
Prince Richard must flee
secretly to Flanders.

00:28.810 --> 00:30.930
We must find a boy
that's the very image of you.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.970
If you didn't think it was safe for
Prince Richard to go to the Tower,

00:35.970 --> 00:38.290
then you must believe
Edward's at risk, too.

00:38.290 --> 00:40.650
Why did he want both sons?

00:40.650 --> 00:44.090
He knows that if you have the heirs,
you hold all the power.

00:44.090 --> 00:46.730
How can you crown a boy who'd
grow up to be your enemy?

00:46.730 --> 00:50.730
Name yourself King.
It is the safest option now.

00:50.730 --> 00:53.370
I'm Doctor Lewis, Lady Margaret
Stanley's physician.

00:53.370 --> 00:55.810
Richard, Duke of Gloucester,
plans to make himself King.

00:55.810 --> 00:58.690
Parliament declared your marriage to
Edward of York invalid

00:58.690 --> 01:00.170
and your sons as bastards.

01:00.170 --> 01:02.170
Lady Margaret, I need your help.

01:02.170 --> 01:03.970
We must free
Prince Edward from the Tower.

01:03.970 --> 01:07.250
We're working with her to get
the Princes out of the Tower.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.410
Is Buckingham with us?

01:08.410 --> 01:11.290
As much as he ever will be. His
claim's as strong as your son's.

01:11.290 --> 01:14.290
Well, then, Henry must
strengthen his claim, marry well.

01:14.290 --> 01:15.890
Princess Elizabeth.

01:15.890 --> 01:19.650
Your ambition will be
the death of the boys.

01:19.650 --> 01:23.890
I will restore your good names
and get my boys back.

01:23.890 --> 01:26.010
I will not stop until it's done.

02:09.370 --> 02:14.450
My affinity, my kin,
my loyal men at arms.

02:16.130 --> 02:17.450
I am the rightful King.

02:18.730 --> 02:24.490
You are guardians of my kingdom,
the men whom I rely on.

02:26.130 --> 02:29.170
Sir Robert Brackenbury,

02:29.170 --> 02:31.770
now Constable of the Tower.

02:40.410 --> 02:45.250
Harry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham...

02:48.410 --> 02:50.290
..Lord Chamberlain of England.

03:05.770 --> 03:09.090
Lord Thomas Stanley,

03:09.090 --> 03:12.730
Lord High Constable of England.

03:14.850 --> 03:17.850
And in place of Anthony Rivers...

03:20.730 --> 03:22.130
..the Order of the Garter.

03:32.010 --> 03:34.650
ALL: I swear my fealty to God

03:34.650 --> 03:35.690
and King Richard.

03:42.090 --> 03:43.890
I'm grateful for your loyalty.

03:53.330 --> 03:55.250
They will be loyal to us, Richard.

03:55.250 --> 03:59.770
You are the rightful King now
and England will grow to love you.

03:59.770 --> 04:02.090
London is against me still.

04:02.090 --> 04:03.890
They will come around.

04:03.890 --> 04:07.250
The North is loyal
and soon the South will follow.

04:07.250 --> 04:13.450
And when the time is right, we will
invest our boy as Prince of Wales

04:13.450 --> 04:16.649
and England will
blossom in your York sun again.

04:16.649 --> 04:17.690
Thank you, Anne.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.530
Nobody wanted a Rivers boy
on the throne whose mother would

04:22.530 --> 04:24.690
tear England apart.

04:24.690 --> 04:28.810
BELLS TOLL

04:35.370 --> 04:38.970
Your Grace, no-one ever mentions
the boys in the Tower

04:38.970 --> 04:40.210
or their mother.

04:40.210 --> 04:44.610
They may not mention them.
It does not mean they are forgotten.

04:44.610 --> 04:48.090
BELLS TOLL

04:55.290 --> 04:57.770
Do they think that if they ring
the bells for days on end,

04:57.770 --> 05:00.290
it will
make his coronation less a sin?

05:01.530 --> 05:03.130
England will not accept it.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.330
They love Edward's boys

05:06.330 --> 05:09.490
and Richard is a fool to think
he can usurp Prince Edward!

05:09.490 --> 05:11.970
Do you still have no word
from Prince Richard?

05:13.450 --> 05:15.010
The letter may have gone astray.

05:16.170 --> 05:19.490
Or perhaps we have sent him
to his death.

05:19.490 --> 05:23.210
Elizabeth! Maybe we shall all die,
now my father's gone.

05:24.290 --> 05:28.730
Maybe he and Richard Grey and
Uncle Anthony were just the first.

05:28.730 --> 05:30.570
No-one else will die, Elizabeth!

05:51.010 --> 05:54.570
I've had word from Buckingham.
He's, um...

05:56.850 --> 06:00.410
He's told me what his terms are
for joining us against the King.

06:04.850 --> 06:08.130
I'll tell Elizabeth and we'll
mount our attack on the Tower.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.330
Does she trust you?

06:11.330 --> 06:16.130
Yes. Once you've rescued her boys,
she'll rise with us against Richard.

06:16.130 --> 06:18.810
Those boys are still a problem,
though.

06:18.810 --> 06:21.490
Richard naming them as bastards
made no difference.

06:21.490 --> 06:25.690
The people still support them. I
know. Anne and Richard know it, too.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.570
But perhaps that might provide us
with a solution.

06:47.210 --> 06:48.530
Lady Anne.

06:48.530 --> 06:49.930
Sir Robert.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.210
I did not think to see you here.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.970
We are shortly
on our royal progress,

06:56.970 --> 07:00.130
but I should like to have sight
of those boys before I go.

07:17.690 --> 07:19.970
What will happen to them,
Your Grace...

07:21.090 --> 07:22.650
..now that both of them are here?

07:23.810 --> 07:27.050
They can be neither boys nor men
because just by living,

07:27.050 --> 07:28.210
they are a threat to us.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.330
We hoped by declaring
their illegitimacy, that they

07:32.330 --> 07:35.130
would lose their power,
but people still support them.

07:36.410 --> 07:37.810
Would you wish them killed?

07:40.010 --> 07:43.610
I can't wish it -
not a pair of innocent boys.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.810
You are too tender-hearted, then...

07:48.850 --> 07:50.530
..because boys become men...

07:53.130 --> 07:55.370
..and even boys can be a cause
that men will kill for.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.170
Then, I do wish it,

08:00.170 --> 08:02.450
else how will the King and I
ever be safe?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.370
..Nomine Patris...

08:24.730 --> 08:26.810
..Spiritus Sancti...

08:26.810 --> 08:29.210
I've received a message
from KING Richard

08:29.210 --> 08:31.610
that if we were to leave
sanctuary and go live at Grafton,

08:31.610 --> 08:33.330
then, my boys would be
returned to me.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.250
He says he would have peace now.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.730
Do you trust him?

08:36.730 --> 08:39.090
Of course I don't trust him!

08:39.090 --> 08:41.370
He killed my son
and my brother Anthony!

08:42.890 --> 08:45.610
My boys must be released to me
before I leave here.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.050
Take care, Your Grace.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.650
Lady Margaret fears the King
would play you false.

08:51.650 --> 08:53.770
She says the Duke of Buckingham
believes it, too,

08:53.770 --> 08:56.810
and that he is so aggrieved, he is
ready to turn against King Richard.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.890
Buckingham will turn?

08:59.890 --> 09:02.850
As evidence of his good faith,
he will storm the Tower with you

09:02.850 --> 09:04.010
to free the Princes.

09:07.890 --> 09:13.210
And what is Buckingham's price, hmm,
for betraying his dearest friend?

09:13.210 --> 09:15.930
The Duke asks that his eldest
daughter should marry your son,

09:15.930 --> 09:19.210
Prince Edward,
and that he himself be named Regent

09:19.210 --> 09:20.930
until the young King is of age.

09:22.450 --> 09:25.170
And no doubt
she wants her exiled son,

09:25.170 --> 09:26.690
Henry Tudor, returned to England.

09:26.690 --> 09:29.770
And Princess Elizabeth's
hand in marriage to Henry,

09:29.770 --> 09:32.490
and that Henry is named heir
after your Prince Edward.

09:34.330 --> 09:38.090
It means your daughter could be
Queen,

09:38.090 --> 09:40.450
and Lady Margaret says that such
a marriage would unite

09:40.450 --> 09:43.170
the Houses of York and Lancaster
and end these wars.

09:51.330 --> 09:53.010
Tell them I will accept,

09:53.010 --> 09:55.770
but my boys must be rescued
straight away,

09:55.770 --> 09:58.890
and my Grey son, Thomas, he will join
the raid to see that all goes well.

10:01.290 --> 10:03.410
Send this note to him
to come to see me.

10:07.290 --> 10:08.770
Your Grace.

10:34.290 --> 10:36.610
'Dear Henry and Jasper,
I greet you well.

10:39.810 --> 10:41.370
'I've much news.

10:41.370 --> 10:44.050
'We are to free Elizabeth's boys
from the Tower

10:44.050 --> 10:46.530
'and then she will bring her army
against Richard.

10:46.530 --> 10:47.770
'You must make ready.

10:49.930 --> 10:52.810
'Whoever wins must find you landed
in force, Lancaster rising,

10:52.810 --> 10:55.290
'and a second battle to fight
against your fresh troops.'

10:58.650 --> 11:00.570
My Lord?

11:00.570 --> 11:02.570
As you were, gentlemen.

11:07.050 --> 11:08.570
'I think this is our moment.'

11:27.610 --> 11:30.690
I have selected the men who will
join in the attack on the Tower.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.050
I have to know your will.

11:40.490 --> 11:41.890
My will is God's will.

11:45.050 --> 11:48.850
When they break down the door of the
Princes' room,

11:48.850 --> 11:51.370
is it your will or God's will

11:51.370 --> 11:55.370
that they slice their
little heads off there and then?

12:01.250 --> 12:04.490
Elizabeth's own son,
Thomas Grey, will be there,

12:04.490 --> 12:06.170
as will her man, Sir John.

12:06.170 --> 12:07.730
Kill them all.

12:09.490 --> 12:12.570
This is YOUR plan
to put YOUR son on the throne.

12:12.570 --> 12:16.330
If the Princes are dead,
then he is two steps closer.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.810
The people will not choose
Henry over them.

12:21.170 --> 12:23.450
I brought the little one to life
myself.

12:24.970 --> 12:29.250
War is hard.
What are your commands, my Lady?

12:32.890 --> 12:37.290
You would have me order the deaths
of two boys, only nine and 12?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.450
HE LAUGHS

12:38.450 --> 12:40.490
Well, say the word
and we will rescue them

12:40.490 --> 12:43.010
from their wicked uncle
and free the Queen, too.

12:45.090 --> 12:47.570
Would you like the royal family
of York restored,

12:47.570 --> 12:49.370
with a little Prince Edward
on the throne?

12:49.370 --> 12:53.690
Stop it. Well, then, you must choose!
Save or slaughter?

12:56.410 --> 12:57.570
Hmm?

13:00.530 --> 13:06.490
Which is it to be?
Save or slaughter?

13:06.490 --> 13:09.170
Obviously, the men must kill them.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.050
Father, the men are waiting.

13:29.010 --> 13:30.570
Do you know your orders?

13:30.570 --> 13:31.930
Yes, Lord Stanley.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.330
I must join the King.

13:35.330 --> 13:38.490
Wait until the men have reached
the gate, then send the letter.

13:38.490 --> 13:39.530
What letter?

13:39.530 --> 13:42.330
To Sir Robert Brackenbury at the
Tower, warning him of the attack.

13:42.330 --> 13:45.850
Warning him? So we are seen to be
on Richard's side if it goes wrong.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.250
Father.

13:51.450 --> 13:53.810
It won't go wrong!

13:55.850 --> 13:57.410
Stanley?

14:08.810 --> 14:10.010
(Oh, Thomas!)

14:14.410 --> 14:17.330
How do I fare as a fisherman,
Mother? It's so good to see you.

14:19.810 --> 14:22.290
Sir John. Thank you.

14:22.290 --> 14:25.010
I have been in mourning
for the King, your Grace,

14:25.010 --> 14:27.530
and aggrieved at your boys being
taken from you.

14:31.130 --> 14:34.730
You will watch them on the raid,
won't you? Buckingham and Stanley.

14:34.730 --> 14:36.810
Both are on the King's royal
progress.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.130
The King trusts no-one
so he's taken them with him.

14:39.130 --> 14:40.450
It's their men we're meeting.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.290
At least it shows
he has no true supporters.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.330
Mother?

14:43.330 --> 14:46.250
If Henry Tudor and Buckingham are
really on our side, we cannot fail.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.570
Richard will not stand a chance
against us all united.

14:48.570 --> 14:50.010
Just bring my boy to me.

14:50.010 --> 14:51.650
Be ready to leave when we send word.

14:54.130 --> 14:57.730
Thomas? John? Take care.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.130
Your Grace.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.250
Your Grace.

15:32.130 --> 15:35.610
Close the gate! Thomas, quickly!
Intruders in the camp!

15:37.970 --> 15:39.010
Secure the door!

15:42.130 --> 15:43.610
Edward! Thomas!

15:43.610 --> 15:45.890
Edward, you must be brave!

15:49.570 --> 15:51.130
We're coming for you!

15:52.850 --> 15:55.050
You must be brave and wait!

15:55.050 --> 15:56.090
Be brave and wait!

15:59.050 --> 16:00.450
LOUD KNOCKING

16:06.330 --> 16:07.450
Shh!

16:14.730 --> 16:17.450
Thomas. Sir John. Why...?

16:17.450 --> 16:18.970
We failed.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.490
The boys were better guarded
than we thought.

16:25.490 --> 16:27.410
The man who should have let us in
was cut down.

16:27.410 --> 16:29.130
You didn't even get inside?

16:29.130 --> 16:31.170
We tried to ram the door

16:31.170 --> 16:34.130
but the guards came from the
courtyard and we had to fight them.

16:34.130 --> 16:38.690
We heard doors slamming and shouting
as the boys were taken further in,

16:38.690 --> 16:41.730
but once we were discovered, there
was no chance we could get to them.

16:41.730 --> 16:44.090
I shouted to my brother,
"You must be brave and wait!

16:44.090 --> 16:46.810
"We are coming for you!"
He did not answer.

16:48.730 --> 16:49.970
My boy!

16:53.570 --> 16:55.290
Thomas, you're hurt.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.250
We must call all-out uprising.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.130
We must hope for a quick defeat

17:00.130 --> 17:02.930
so we can reach the boys before
they come to any harm.

17:02.930 --> 17:05.530
I'll write to Lady Margaret
and tell her to raise Buckingham.

17:05.530 --> 17:09.810
And do you trust your newfound
friends, Mother...

17:11.210 --> 17:14.609
..who suddenly flock to rescue the
boys and yet don't quite succeed?

17:14.609 --> 17:18.970
Because all of them feast quite
merrily at Uncle Richard's table.

17:18.970 --> 17:21.210
I cannot choose my allies,
Elizabeth.

17:21.210 --> 17:24.250
And to save my son,
I would plot with the Devil himself!

17:26.970 --> 17:28.890
I think that you already have.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.850
Richard, what is it?

17:53.930 --> 17:55.930
The Rivers have attacked
the Tower...

17:57.730 --> 18:00.210
..the moment we're in the North
and miles away!

18:01.770 --> 18:03.650
Sir Robert Brackenbury has
written to me.

18:05.530 --> 18:07.330
She did not get the Princes out?

18:07.330 --> 18:09.050
They're not Princes any more!

18:10.410 --> 18:11.450
I'm sorry.

18:12.530 --> 18:13.570
Your Grace?

18:13.570 --> 18:18.490
Your son, Lord Strange,
he found out and sent a warning.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.770
It came too late
but I am grateful to him.

18:23.330 --> 18:26.210
You must punish those concerned
and show no mercy.

18:26.210 --> 18:28.330
The boys are safe
under lock and key.

18:28.330 --> 18:32.650
It is HER and no-one else.
Of course it is!

18:32.650 --> 18:35.650
But how does she still have men
she can command?

18:35.650 --> 18:38.130
The boys command them
by their very living.

18:42.170 --> 18:45.690
We must have our boy
invested Prince of Wales.

18:45.690 --> 18:48.290
We'll do it here in York,
then there can be no question

18:48.290 --> 18:50.010
who is next in line
for the throne.

19:05.330 --> 19:06.930
Why could we not reach them?

19:11.490 --> 19:12.930
You want the boys to live?

19:22.490 --> 19:28.730
I am your obedient daughter, so
if it is your will that they should

19:28.730 --> 19:34.130
take the throne and not my son,
then you need to give me a sign.

19:38.730 --> 19:41.090
You need to give me a sign
right now!

20:23.450 --> 20:25.170
They botched it, then.

20:28.210 --> 20:30.050
If my son hadn't sent
his warning letter,

20:30.050 --> 20:32.290
Richard may well have pointed
his finger at me.

20:32.290 --> 20:35.490
How do I know it wasn't your son's
letter that caused us to fail?

20:36.890 --> 20:40.010
Richard plans to move
the Princes to the North.

20:40.010 --> 20:41.570
Once he does,
we'll never get to him.

20:41.570 --> 20:43.770
So you need a new plan quickly.
I have a plan!

20:43.770 --> 20:45.330
I just don't care to share it
with you

20:45.330 --> 20:46.770
in case you send any more letters.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.730
I risked my neck leaving
the King's side to see

20:48.730 --> 20:51.810
if this thing can be salvaged.
Do not exclude me now!

21:00.930 --> 21:05.490
I'm meeting Buckingham.
He has access to the Tower.

21:14.730 --> 21:17.050
You are older than I am,
and therefore wiser,

21:17.050 --> 21:19.530
and I...I trust your holy judgment.

21:23.610 --> 21:25.650
Do you think we must try again to
free the Princes

21:25.650 --> 21:27.810
and restore them to their state?

21:27.810 --> 21:29.930
If they were legitimate,
then of course.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.770
But Richard says they're not,

21:32.770 --> 21:35.610
so perhaps you'd risk everything
just for a witch's sons.

21:35.610 --> 21:36.930
Perhaps we might.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.010
I do fear for their lives, though.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.170
Richard will surely want them
out of the way

21:43.170 --> 21:45.730
now our plot to free them
came so close.

21:45.730 --> 21:47.850
You don't think
he would murder them?

21:47.850 --> 21:49.210
God forbid.

21:51.050 --> 21:53.970
Though if he did, it would mean
the end of the Rivers line.

21:53.970 --> 21:58.410
That would serve her right!
That witch, Elizabeth,

21:58.410 --> 22:00.650
who made me marry her yokel sister!

22:02.690 --> 22:06.370
Or if someone else were to kill them
in Richard's name,

22:06.370 --> 22:09.890
then who would doubt
it was really Richard's doing?

22:09.890 --> 22:12.170
And you, of course,
have access to the Tower.

22:13.610 --> 22:17.130
And the rebellion that overthrew him

22:17.130 --> 22:19.530
would leave the throne open
to someone...

22:21.610 --> 22:22.650
..new.

22:25.530 --> 22:27.690
But, of course,
you mean your own boy, Henry Tudor.

22:27.690 --> 22:31.130
Henry is direct Lancastrian heir.
It is his birthright. Humph!

22:31.130 --> 22:33.490
We should continue as planned -
you, my son

22:33.490 --> 22:36.250
and Elizabeth, working together
to overthrow Richard.

22:36.250 --> 22:38.610
Only, what SHE doesn't know is that
when he's defeated,

22:38.610 --> 22:40.450
we'll put MY son on the throne,
not hers.

22:42.450 --> 22:45.290
And if, God forbid,

22:45.290 --> 22:49.050
your Henry should fall in battle?

22:51.690 --> 22:53.810
Then, you would be King,

22:53.810 --> 22:55.690
as you would
if he should die without issue.

22:55.690 --> 22:58.970
But if he should live,
then you will have his gratitude

22:58.970 --> 23:00.290
and any price you name.

23:04.730 --> 23:06.730
Will you take my fealty to your son?

23:18.170 --> 23:22.850
I swear my fealty to God
and to King Henry Tudor!

23:25.090 --> 23:27.770
On behalf of my son, Henry Tudor,

23:27.770 --> 23:31.250
the rightful King of England,
I accept your fealty.

23:32.850 --> 23:35.970
Let us overthrow Richard
and his Standard of the Boar

23:35.970 --> 23:37.770
and bring joy back to England.

23:40.570 --> 23:42.610
Shall I really be King one day,
Father?

23:43.930 --> 23:47.970
Yes, Edward.
You will be King of England.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.170
I don't want to be King
if you will die.

23:55.410 --> 23:59.250
I won't die for a very long time.
I promise.

24:00.770 --> 24:03.130
And I always keep my word, don't I?

24:09.530 --> 24:12.770
Richard, Edward. It is time.

24:16.050 --> 24:18.290
'My beautiful boy.'

24:19.930 --> 24:21.090
Brave as your father.

24:22.530 --> 24:23.850
He'd be so proud of you.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.770
I will raise an army in Flanders,
like him,

24:27.770 --> 24:29.650
and come back to avenge Richard.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.250
SHAKES LETTER

24:46.250 --> 24:50.050
Thomas sends word that no-one has
seen our brother

24:50.050 --> 24:52.610
or the changeling since the raid.

24:52.610 --> 24:57.890
Our letters are returned to us
with the seals not even broken!

24:57.890 --> 25:01.850
And now Richard has made
his own son Prince of Wales.

25:01.850 --> 25:03.730
And that usurper will die for it!

25:07.850 --> 25:10.330
Haven't enough died, Mother?

25:10.330 --> 25:13.170
It is his birthright, Elizabeth,
the throne of England!

25:13.170 --> 25:16.570
And this is my LIFE and my sisters'!

25:16.570 --> 25:18.090
Lizzie, don't!

25:18.090 --> 25:21.930
You coop us up here like rats while
all you do all day is plot revenge!

25:21.930 --> 25:23.050
Elizabeth!

25:23.050 --> 25:26.290
You want the throne, but do you
even have a boy to put on it?

25:31.490 --> 25:32.530
No.

26:17.970 --> 26:19.890
Queen Elizabeth? Your Grace?

26:24.970 --> 26:26.130
Thomas!

26:29.130 --> 26:30.570
With love from Flanders.

26:36.050 --> 26:37.370
SHE LAUGHS

26:39.050 --> 26:42.930
Richard! He's safe!
My Prince Richard!

26:47.330 --> 26:49.690
'My dear Jasper and Henry.

26:49.690 --> 26:52.930
'Our London house is now the secret
headquarters of our rebellion.

26:54.410 --> 26:57.850
'Dr Lewis goes between Elizabeth
and myself almost daily

26:57.850 --> 27:00.850
'as she, in turn, draws out those men
still loyal to the York Princes

27:00.850 --> 27:02.490
'and signs them to our rebellion.

27:05.210 --> 27:08.010
'My spies report that Buckingham's
men are secretly arming,

27:08.010 --> 27:10.530
'as he promised, and will meet you
when you land in Wales.

27:12.210 --> 27:14.810
'He and Elizabeth think that you will
land your men in Tenby to

27:14.810 --> 27:18.930
'join them. They do not know
you will be off the coast, waiting

27:18.930 --> 27:22.570
'until their battle with Richard is
over so you can defeat the victor.

27:31.770 --> 27:35.210
'Only Richard, far away in the North,
has no notion of the plans

27:35.210 --> 27:37.850
'that are forming at the very heart
of his own capital.

27:39.650 --> 27:44.330
'And when the time comes,
he'll have no idea what hit him.'

27:46.850 --> 27:48.610
What's wrong, my love?

27:48.610 --> 27:52.290
I thought once the boys were
disinherited, we would be safe,

27:52.290 --> 27:56.810
but Henry Tudor is betrothed to
Princess Elizabeth, our niece.

27:56.810 --> 27:58.330
How do you know?

27:58.330 --> 28:00.330
Lord Stanley told me.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.250
I fear I must reprimand my wife.

28:02.250 --> 28:05.330
I thought
she'd respond to my authority but...

28:05.330 --> 28:07.130
The Tudors
and Elizabeth are in alliance?

28:07.130 --> 28:08.690
They're planning a rebellion.

28:08.690 --> 28:12.130
I must insist the Duke of Brittany
hands Henry Tudor over

28:12.130 --> 28:13.410
before he can attack.

28:15.050 --> 28:17.330
Thank you for your loyalty,
Lord Stanley.

28:17.330 --> 28:18.650
Your Grace.

28:20.010 --> 28:21.610
Your Grace.

28:28.850 --> 28:33.090
Richard, Lord Stanley would let you
lock up his own wife!

28:33.090 --> 28:34.690
How do you know you can trust him?

28:34.690 --> 28:39.130
He says he's loyal to me.
That's the thing with Stanley.

28:39.130 --> 28:42.770
No-one ever really knows
whose side he's on.

28:42.770 --> 28:45.170
You must arrest Lady Margaret.
She has betrayed us!

28:45.170 --> 28:46.570
Don't tell me what to do!

28:48.290 --> 28:50.290
I have enough enemies as it is.

28:50.290 --> 28:54.210
I cannot arrest a woman who is
notorious for her piety

28:54.210 --> 28:56.330
or I'll create a dozen more!

28:56.330 --> 28:59.330
Richard, you must not let this come
between us.

29:01.610 --> 29:03.930
We stand together
and then we are strong.

29:05.730 --> 29:07.050
I know. I'm sorry.

29:09.170 --> 29:13.170
I will intercept her letters.
I will set my spies on her.

29:13.170 --> 29:14.930
We will learn more that way.

29:14.930 --> 29:17.010
And if Brittany won't hand
Tudor over?

29:18.530 --> 29:22.170
He will invade
and I must prepare for war.

30:14.330 --> 30:15.930
Margaret.

30:15.930 --> 30:17.450
Margaret!

30:18.450 --> 30:21.410
I can't stay long.
The King trusts no-one any more.

30:21.410 --> 30:24.090
He knows there's a rebellion
in the making and he suspects you,

30:24.090 --> 30:25.210
and therefore me as well.

30:25.210 --> 30:28.290
So tell me quickly,
are the Princes dead?

30:30.850 --> 30:32.370
Yes.

30:32.370 --> 30:33.810
Have you seen the bodies?

30:35.690 --> 30:37.330
Of course I have not!

30:37.330 --> 30:39.490
How do you know they're dead?

30:39.490 --> 30:42.690
Because the Duke and I agreed it!

30:42.690 --> 30:47.170
How do you know he hasn't lied to you
and he holds them somewhere safe?

30:47.170 --> 30:49.210
What would he have to gain
from that?

30:49.210 --> 30:51.130
He wants them gone as much as we do.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.650
So you'd better be loyal.

30:59.210 --> 31:01.050
You'd better fight for Henry.

31:09.930 --> 31:11.490
It is Buckingham!

31:13.010 --> 31:17.450
My own true friend who is behind the
rebellion of Margaret Stanley's!

31:17.450 --> 31:19.530
I've intercepted her letters.

31:19.530 --> 31:20.810
Richard!

31:24.810 --> 31:26.010
Leave! Your Grace.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.730
A man with the best cause
to be true,

31:35.730 --> 31:39.090
I have given him everything
he's ever asked for.

31:39.090 --> 31:41.690
And never was a traitor
better treated.

31:43.370 --> 31:46.810
And now he is joining Elizabeth
and Henry Tudor,

31:46.810 --> 31:49.690
who is mustering to sail
from Brittany.

31:50.690 --> 31:54.570
Buckingham is false.
Lady Margaret too.

31:54.570 --> 31:57.610
Elizabeth we expect,
but all of them together...

31:58.650 --> 32:00.650
Now I must postpone my Parliament.

32:01.810 --> 32:04.930
Just when I'd called for it
and prepared.

32:04.930 --> 32:08.370
I just want to show England
what a king I can be

32:08.370 --> 32:10.770
and how I planned to serve them.

32:10.770 --> 32:14.170
And you will still show them.
You'll defeat this uprising.

32:14.170 --> 32:16.490
That is not even the worst of it.

32:16.490 --> 32:19.410
What? What is it?

32:19.410 --> 32:21.530
Buckingham is spreading a rumour

32:21.530 --> 32:24.530
that the Princes in the Tower
are dead.

32:24.530 --> 32:25.690
What?

32:27.090 --> 32:28.810
By my hand.

32:31.170 --> 32:33.490
It is all over the city.

32:33.490 --> 32:35.130
But why would they say that?

32:36.370 --> 32:40.850
Because Buckingham slanders me
to win men to his cause.

32:43.370 --> 32:44.690
And ARE they dead?

32:45.770 --> 32:47.130
It's not true.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.090
You know I have not harmed them.

32:53.250 --> 32:55.210
You know I would never do that.

32:56.930 --> 32:59.050
Would someone else have done it?

33:02.050 --> 33:04.170
They will be safely in the Tower.

33:05.570 --> 33:07.770
I have written to Sir Robert
to be sure.

33:16.050 --> 33:18.010
But now I must prepare for war.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.290
Sir John.

33:43.690 --> 33:46.330
I offer you my sympathy, your Grace.

33:46.330 --> 33:50.770
We prayed for the Princes,
and we hoped to rescue them in time.

33:50.770 --> 33:53.690
We are more sorry for your loss
than I can say.

33:55.650 --> 33:56.890
My loss?

33:58.810 --> 34:00.530
What?

34:00.530 --> 34:01.930
God spare me.

34:03.170 --> 34:06.570
Don't say you didn't know,
and I've just told you like a fool?

34:06.570 --> 34:11.690
Are you saying that my son,
Prince Edward, has been executed?

34:13.449 --> 34:15.330
All I've heard is dead.

34:15.330 --> 34:17.210
No. No.

34:18.850 --> 34:21.489
Forgive me
for being the one to tell you.

34:21.489 --> 34:24.050
All we wanted
was to know your wishes now.

34:24.050 --> 34:26.730
He has not been executed. No.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.090
Not publicly.

34:29.449 --> 34:31.969
We were just told the Princes
had been put to death,

34:31.969 --> 34:36.330
God save them, and the rebellion
would go on against Richard,

34:36.330 --> 34:39.610
but now we would put Henry Tudor
on the throne.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.489
Margaret Beaufort's boy?

34:41.489 --> 34:43.610
We mustered for your cause,
your Grace.

34:43.610 --> 34:45.770
Who told you they were dead?

34:45.770 --> 34:47.170
A man of Buckingham's.

34:47.170 --> 34:50.050
The false King had ordered
their deaths in secret.

34:51.850 --> 34:52.969
Listen to me.

34:55.290 --> 34:58.450
Go back to Kent
and tell your men to rise up.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.770
Tell them to destroy
this false King Richard

35:02.770 --> 35:05.850
and to take vengeance for me
and my poor boys.

35:47.250 --> 35:50.090
Buckingham and Tudor are to meet
in Wales.

35:50.090 --> 35:52.410
They will cross the River Severn
to invade.

35:52.410 --> 35:54.730
I must cut them off
and rout them there.

35:55.770 --> 35:57.810
May I give you a wife's blessing?

36:04.490 --> 36:08.130
Come back to me, my Richard.

36:08.130 --> 36:09.610
My love.

36:19.850 --> 36:22.330
There's a rumour
that my boys are dead.

36:22.330 --> 36:24.410
The Duke of Buckingham is saying it.

36:25.450 --> 36:28.210
I fear, your Grace,
it is more than just a rumour.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.770
The false King Richard has killed
his nephews to secure his throne.

36:34.250 --> 36:36.850
At least my Richard is safe, though.

36:36.850 --> 36:38.650
He's safe?

36:38.650 --> 36:40.450
They are both safe, please God.

36:42.530 --> 36:45.570
But they haven't been seen
since the Tower attack.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.370
The Duke and Lady Margaret
both believe

36:47.370 --> 36:48.890
that Richard had them killed.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.410
But why would Buckingham tell
the men

36:52.410 --> 36:55.130
in the very moment we muster them
to free my boys

36:55.130 --> 36:57.010
that our cause is already lost?

36:57.010 --> 36:59.650
So that everyone knows it was
the false King Richard who gave

36:59.650 --> 37:03.130
the order. That he's to blame.
But who would doubt it was Richard?

37:03.130 --> 37:05.050
No-one would doubt it, of course.

37:11.770 --> 37:12.970
Your Grace...

37:14.290 --> 37:17.970
..what did you mean when you said,
"At least my son Richard is safe"?

37:21.530 --> 37:24.770
Doctor, if you had two rare jewels
and you feared thieves,

37:24.770 --> 37:27.970
would you put both of them
in the same box?

37:27.970 --> 37:30.370
Richard was not in the Tower? Hush!

37:30.370 --> 37:33.050
But two boys were killed
in their beds!

37:35.010 --> 37:36.530
In their beds?

37:36.530 --> 37:38.050
Were they?

37:39.450 --> 37:40.970
You know that for sure now?

37:42.250 --> 37:44.290
How do you know it?

37:44.290 --> 37:47.010
Please! How are you suddenly
so very sure? Your Grace, I...

37:47.010 --> 37:49.530
If you had the slightest hand in
this, then you will go to hell

37:49.530 --> 37:51.050
and so will Lady Margaret!

37:53.410 --> 37:55.490
Mother, what's happened?

37:55.490 --> 37:57.290
Elizabeth?

37:57.290 --> 38:00.810
Have you heard the river singing,
as it did when Anthony

38:00.810 --> 38:03.210
and your brother Richard Grey died?

38:03.210 --> 38:04.890
Not like that night.

38:04.890 --> 38:06.290
But you hear something?

38:07.330 --> 38:09.250
Faintly.

38:09.250 --> 38:11.330
Like a lullaby. Don't you?

38:15.530 --> 38:16.570
No.

38:19.730 --> 38:23.090
They're saying that your brother
Prince Edward is dead.

38:28.090 --> 38:29.770
No. No.

38:29.770 --> 38:33.050
Mother...
Lizzie, I think I was mistaken,

38:33.050 --> 38:35.130
and that the people who I thought
were on our side

38:35.130 --> 38:37.210
are our bitterest enemies.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.850
And all our safety now depends
on Buckingham

38:40.850 --> 38:43.810
and Henry Tudor losing this battle.

38:45.050 --> 38:47.770
I thought King Richard was our enemy

38:47.770 --> 38:50.890
and that's why we rose up with them
against him?

38:50.890 --> 38:53.250
Richard stole the crown

38:53.250 --> 38:57.210
but I think it was Buckingham
and Lady Margaret who killed my boy.

38:58.610 --> 39:00.450
I must write to my son and Sir John

39:00.450 --> 39:03.970
and tell them
that we are changing sides

39:03.970 --> 39:07.250
and that they now must turn
against Tudor and Buckingham.

39:17.330 --> 39:19.290
Elizabeth summoned me
to sanctuary tonight.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.610
She begged me to tell her
that the Princes are not dead.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.210
I didn't know what you would have
me say

39:23.210 --> 39:25.010
so I told her what everyone
is whispering,

39:25.010 --> 39:26.770
that Richard had them killed.

39:26.770 --> 39:29.330
But, Lady Margaret,
she said something else.

39:31.250 --> 39:32.890
Tell me.

39:32.890 --> 39:35.330
She said,
"At least my Richard is safe."

39:36.890 --> 39:39.370
Prince Richard, how can he be?

39:39.370 --> 39:41.890
She looked at me in the most
determined manner and she said,

39:41.890 --> 39:45.650
"Doctor, if you had two rare jewels,
would you put them in the same box?"

39:47.250 --> 39:49.690
She would say nothing more.

39:49.690 --> 39:52.010
She became most angry
and I took my leave.

39:54.050 --> 39:55.530
Lady Margaret, is it true?

39:57.290 --> 39:58.850
Are the boys both dead?

40:03.250 --> 40:05.890
They are like all of us,
in the hands of God.

40:08.330 --> 40:09.450
Goodnight.

40:11.650 --> 40:12.930
Lady Margaret?

40:35.730 --> 40:37.730
Mother?

40:37.730 --> 40:39.890
I can't sleep. Nor I.

40:42.050 --> 40:44.850
Where are they meeting?
Buckingham and Tudor?

40:46.050 --> 40:49.170
In Wales, to cross the river.

40:52.530 --> 40:54.610
Then, we must do something.

40:59.010 --> 41:00.810
I wish that it would rain.

41:04.970 --> 41:06.210
Let it rain.

41:19.890 --> 41:23.450
THUNDER RUMBLES

41:33.850 --> 41:36.210
You must not worry
about your father.

41:37.450 --> 41:40.130
He will be home soon
and we'll all be safe again.

41:41.130 --> 41:44.210
Buckingham's army will wait in Wales
for Henry Tudor.

41:51.170 --> 41:53.250
HORSE WHINNIES

41:55.130 --> 41:59.730
Lady Margaret will know that her son
cannot set sail in this.

41:59.730 --> 42:02.370
Not if it's this bad
over the Channel.

42:02.370 --> 42:03.690
And it will be.

42:14.410 --> 42:15.930
5,000 mercenaries.

42:18.050 --> 42:21.690
A force that cannot fail against
whoever wins the first battle.

42:23.410 --> 42:25.970
Except we cannot even get there
for the rain.

42:32.810 --> 42:35.170
'My dearest Anne.

42:35.170 --> 42:37.610
'I am in hell.

42:37.610 --> 42:40.450
'Our march is slower than torture,

42:40.450 --> 42:43.010
'the horses chest-deep in the mud,

42:43.010 --> 42:44.890
'and half the bridges
are washed away

42:44.890 --> 42:47.410
'so we have to go for miles
to find a ford.

42:49.050 --> 42:51.210
'My men march with their heads down.

42:52.370 --> 42:55.730
'When we rest, we can't light fires,
as everything is soaked.'

42:59.810 --> 43:01.770
THUNDER RUMBLES

43:01.770 --> 43:04.570
Buckingham will give up his wait
for Tudor.

43:06.610 --> 43:09.330
He will be forced to fight Richard
on his own.

43:19.610 --> 43:23.570
'Buckingham's life will shrink
to a long march in the rain.'

43:26.290 --> 43:28.850
'He will pray God for a miracle.'

43:29.850 --> 43:31.130
But not in this rain.

43:32.330 --> 43:33.850
'There are no miracles.

43:34.970 --> 43:38.290
'And God is raging at what
they have done to my poor boy.'

43:43.690 --> 43:44.770
'Lady Margaret.

43:46.610 --> 43:50.250
'Your son has not arrived to join
me, and most of my men have fled.

43:52.810 --> 43:56.850
'I cannot win against Richard with
these numbers, and he knows it,

43:56.850 --> 43:58.690
'and is hunting me.

44:02.810 --> 44:06.850
'When I am routed, he will build
a scaffold for all the traitors,

44:06.850 --> 44:10.410
'and he will search the Tower
for the Princes.'

44:11.770 --> 44:13.050
Edward?

44:13.050 --> 44:14.090
Richard?

44:16.970 --> 44:20.050
Guard! Quickly, man, open the door!

44:21.610 --> 44:22.810
Your Grace.

45:22.530 --> 45:25.410
SHE LAUGHS

45:39.610 --> 45:40.970
Richard?

45:40.970 --> 45:42.490
What are you doing?

45:42.490 --> 45:44.850
You must sentence the traitors.

45:44.850 --> 45:47.410
They are gone.
They've just vanished.

45:47.410 --> 45:50.410
It'll be that witch!
She will have spirited them away.

45:50.410 --> 45:53.210
That is why you must drag her
out of sanctuary and punish her!

45:53.210 --> 45:56.130
I've searched every room
and stairwell.

45:56.130 --> 45:57.930
Where can they be?

45:57.930 --> 46:00.050
Richard, please!

46:00.050 --> 46:03.050
Name the traitors
and call your Parliament!

46:03.050 --> 46:05.490
It's what you've always wanted!

46:05.490 --> 46:09.210
Do the good for England you've
dreamed of and then we can be happy.

46:11.290 --> 46:13.810
The guards said
they put the boys to bed one night,

46:13.810 --> 46:15.370
and in the morning they were gone.

46:15.370 --> 46:18.050
Sir Robert Brackenbury
raised the alarm.

46:18.050 --> 46:19.290
Sir Robert?

46:20.610 --> 46:22.490
What did Sir Robert say of it?

46:24.570 --> 46:25.850
That he was sorry.

46:28.410 --> 46:29.610
He is sorry.

46:31.370 --> 46:32.850
So, where are they?

46:35.050 --> 46:36.650
Then it must be Buckingham.

46:38.930 --> 46:41.090
Surely it must.
Who else could it be?

46:44.450 --> 46:46.930
Will you ask him...

46:46.930 --> 46:48.890
if he has killed them?

46:50.090 --> 46:52.170
I will execute Buckingham

46:52.170 --> 46:55.570
for ruining my good name
and my peace.

47:47.490 --> 47:48.770
He knows.

47:50.850 --> 47:53.170
Richard knows you've been
working with the Queen.

47:54.410 --> 47:56.050
You're guilty of treason...

47:57.330 --> 47:58.810
..punishable by death.

48:02.410 --> 48:04.610
If...if he thinks
that you're faithful?

48:04.610 --> 48:05.890
I AM faithful.

48:05.890 --> 48:09.450
While you were betraying him,
I was at his side.

48:09.450 --> 48:10.890
Richard's shocked!

48:12.290 --> 48:14.810
He feels you're as faithless
as your kinsman Buckingham.

48:14.810 --> 48:16.090
He's been executed.

48:21.890 --> 48:22.930
What do I do? I...

48:24.210 --> 48:27.490
I cou... I cou... I cou...
I could, I could run away?

48:27.490 --> 48:29.890
I could go to Brittany?
I have...I have my money chest.

48:29.890 --> 48:32.770
But I've been nominated
as your jailer.

48:32.770 --> 48:35.130
Richard's decided
that all your lands

48:35.130 --> 48:37.130
and your wealth will come to me.

48:37.130 --> 48:39.370
My men are in your chambers now
removing your goods

48:39.370 --> 48:41.010
and your money chest.

48:41.010 --> 48:42.490
And your wine.

48:42.490 --> 48:44.330
You are robbing me?!

48:47.010 --> 48:49.570
You led me to the plot to rob me!

48:49.570 --> 48:52.530
You'll be under house arrest
at my country house at Bletsoe.

48:52.530 --> 48:56.010
Your servants will be dismissed,
you will not meet with anyone.

48:56.010 --> 48:58.250
You betrayed me to get my fortune.

48:59.330 --> 49:02.370
No, Margaret. I've saved you
from a traitor's death.

49:03.610 --> 49:07.490
And I'm still in place to hear
of Richard's plans against your son.

49:07.490 --> 49:10.090
You signed his death warrant
with your failure.

49:10.090 --> 49:13.450
You can write to him, but all
your letters should come through me.

49:13.450 --> 49:16.850
I must have the appearance
of controlling you completely.

49:16.850 --> 49:18.530
The "appearance"?!

49:21.850 --> 49:25.090
You'll give the appearance
of being on both sides!

49:27.130 --> 49:28.690
Always.

49:44.210 --> 49:46.370
Sister, let me in.

49:46.370 --> 49:48.170
You're not my brother!

49:48.170 --> 49:49.290
I am the King.

49:49.290 --> 49:51.050
Not to me.

49:51.050 --> 49:53.570
Let me in, Elizabeth,
for all our sakes.

50:14.250 --> 50:15.650
Tell me, please.

50:16.650 --> 50:20.010
Do you have your son Edward
and his brother somewhere safe?

50:21.210 --> 50:22.970
They're not in the Tower?

50:22.970 --> 50:28.690
In God's name, if you have,
I swear I will not hunt them.

50:28.690 --> 50:30.170
Just tell me that they are safe.

50:30.170 --> 50:31.250
No.

50:32.490 --> 50:33.770
No.

50:42.090 --> 50:45.690
Everyone is saying they are dead
and that I did it.

50:47.690 --> 50:48.770
And did you?

50:52.050 --> 50:54.650
Think, Elizabeth.

50:54.650 --> 50:59.090
When we killed King Henry,
we had his body shown to the people.

50:59.090 --> 51:03.890
The whole point was to tell
the world that his line had ended.

51:06.610 --> 51:08.330
If I killed your sons...

51:09.850 --> 51:11.490
..I would have done the same.

51:16.970 --> 51:18.530
I am sorry for your loss.

51:20.770 --> 51:23.810
You have nothing to gain now
by staying in sanctuary.

51:25.490 --> 51:29.690
I'll make you an agreement
and promise for your safety

51:29.690 --> 51:32.050
and that of your girls,
if you come out.

51:32.050 --> 51:35.050
I shall go home?
Be under house arrest.

51:35.050 --> 51:37.970
I cannot trust you
not to come against me.

51:39.010 --> 51:40.930
I cannot trust anyone, anywhere.

51:54.210 --> 51:57.250
You have grown beautiful, Elizabeth.

51:57.250 --> 52:00.050
Lizzie, Cecily, leave us.

52:06.050 --> 52:09.810
People are saying
that I killed your brothers...

52:12.930 --> 52:15.890
..but I want you to know
that I am innocent.

52:17.610 --> 52:18.850
You have my word.

52:25.650 --> 52:28.210
Whoever killed my sons,
I will curse them.

52:30.170 --> 52:32.330
We will both curse them...

52:33.970 --> 52:36.930
..down the years,
until all their sons die out.

52:39.050 --> 52:40.330
Take care.

52:41.610 --> 52:43.610
Your curses last too long...

52:45.210 --> 52:47.250
..and may turn on someone you love.

53:04.410 --> 53:06.330
Bless me, Father, for I have...

53:09.010 --> 53:10.890
I do not know what I have done!

53:12.890 --> 53:14.970
I'm afraid I have done something.

53:16.050 --> 53:17.730
I...

53:17.730 --> 53:20.250
I said things to someone...

53:22.170 --> 53:24.330
..and what if he has acted
upon them?

53:27.050 --> 53:29.850
What if I killed two little boys?

53:50.970 --> 53:52.410
What should I do?

53:52.410 --> 53:55.890
Read it aloud. Melusina will take
the curse and see it's done.

54:01.610 --> 54:03.730
Our boy Edward was in the Tower.

54:05.970 --> 54:09.050
But he is gone
and we think he is murdered.

54:11.850 --> 54:14.290
BOTH: We come to you, Lady Mother,

54:14.290 --> 54:18.090
and we put into your depths
this curse -

54:18.090 --> 54:21.210
whoever took our firstborn son,

54:21.210 --> 54:24.170
you will take his firstborn son
from him,

54:24.170 --> 54:26.490
and his grandsons too,

54:26.490 --> 54:30.130
and his firstborn boys
all down his line.

54:30.130 --> 54:34.290
And we will know the murderer
by the workings of our curse.

54:37.130 --> 54:38.490
Burn it.

55:03.330 --> 55:05.410
Lizzie come, come.

55:18.450 --> 55:20.370
Richard, what are you doing?

55:21.970 --> 55:24.250
Parliament is waiting for you,
my love.

55:25.650 --> 55:27.690
Elizabeth doesn't have the boys.

55:29.730 --> 55:32.490
She doesn't know where they are.

55:32.490 --> 55:33.810
You have seen her?

55:35.210 --> 55:37.130
I had to know.

55:37.130 --> 55:39.130
I had to ask her.

55:39.130 --> 55:40.490
What did she say?

55:41.930 --> 55:45.610
She said she would curse
whoever killed them.

55:45.610 --> 55:47.290
She cursed us? Not us!

55:49.410 --> 55:51.170
I did not order their deaths.

55:53.330 --> 55:55.010
How could you think that of me?

56:05.130 --> 56:07.810
I've said Elizabeth can come out
of sanctuary.

56:10.770 --> 56:12.130
What?

56:12.130 --> 56:14.850
She will go to Grafton
under house arrest.

56:16.130 --> 56:18.250
The older girls will come to court.

56:19.810 --> 56:23.490
I want to keep Princess Elizabeth
close to me.

56:23.490 --> 56:25.330
What are you doing?

56:25.330 --> 56:27.130
They are witches!

56:27.130 --> 56:30.410
She rose against you
and only God's rain saved you.

56:30.410 --> 56:31.610
Please, Richard!

56:32.850 --> 56:34.130
Richard?

56:35.850 --> 56:37.530
What is happening to us?

56:59.610 --> 57:02.290
Thomas Grey sends his love
from Brittany.

57:02.290 --> 57:04.890
He's fled to safety
at Henry Tudor's court.

57:05.970 --> 57:07.250
Lucky him!

57:10.530 --> 57:13.170
Well, I take it I no longer need
to marry Tudor?

57:14.210 --> 57:17.450
Now we think his mother killed
my brother Edward.

57:17.450 --> 57:21.250
I've written to Lady Margaret
that your betrothal still stands.

57:21.250 --> 57:23.610
Wha... What?

57:23.610 --> 57:25.050
Mother... Lizzie, it was you

57:25.050 --> 57:27.250
who told me you foresaw
you would be Queen.

57:28.570 --> 57:30.690
I said that I feared it!

57:30.690 --> 57:32.650
Not that I wanted it!

57:32.650 --> 57:35.650
Henry Tudor could be killed
the moment he sets foot in England.

57:35.650 --> 57:37.370
But he will come.

57:37.370 --> 57:39.810
He has his army
and he will not waste it.

57:39.810 --> 57:42.010
He will try again
for the throne of England

57:42.010 --> 57:45.770
and we have not sacrificed this much
to step aside if he should win.

57:47.210 --> 57:49.010
I will not marry him, mother.

57:51.250 --> 57:53.130
No matter what you say.

57:58.890 --> 58:00.930
Fortune will send me someone else.

58:01.305 --> 58:07.710
