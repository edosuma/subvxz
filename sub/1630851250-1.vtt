<i>In the void, pairs of
particles are continuously created.</i>

02:30.073 --> 02:34.712
<i>Their only destiny is to meet
and disappear into each other.</i>

02:42.019 --> 02:44.922
<i>When two particles that have
interacted with each other</i>

02:44.954 --> 02:49.926
<i>are separated, they're
no longer distinct particles.</i>

02:52.763 --> 02:56.033
<i>The same thing happens
when two people fall in love.</i>

02:57.601 --> 03:00.137
<i>Even if life pulls them apart,</i>

03:00.169 --> 03:04.007
<i>they'll always carry some trace
of the other person inside.</i>

04:13.577 --> 04:15.679
Excellent time, Steve.
Better than yesterday.

04:15.711 --> 04:16.947
Thanks, coach.

04:19.714 --> 04:21.619
- We're not there yet, somehow.
- I know.

04:21.652 --> 04:24.054
Hey, Roy, keep this up,
you're not gonna make the team.

04:24.087 --> 04:25.256
Which means no meet in Rome,

04:25.289 --> 04:27.791
out of college,
no more scholarship.

04:27.823 --> 04:28.893
You stopped.

04:28.926 --> 04:30.761
- What were you thinking?
- Nothing.

04:30.794 --> 04:32.196
No, no.
What were you thinking?

04:32.229 --> 04:34.698
It's none
of your fucking business!

04:34.730 --> 04:36.966
So you can afford
to throw this away?

04:36.999 --> 04:39.302
- Yeah, what if I want to?
- Did you win the lottery?

04:39.335 --> 04:41.271
- Don't need the scholarship?
- Are you my dad?

04:41.304 --> 04:43.674
I already have one.
I fucking hate him!

04:43.707 --> 04:46.777
Hey! Everything you do in this
place is my fucking business.

04:46.809 --> 04:50.680
So you don't like that?
Yeah, there's the door. Go! Go!

04:52.583 --> 04:55.585
Come back
when you wanna fucking swim!

05:27.249 --> 05:29.586
Steve, wait.
You told him I'm single

05:29.619 --> 05:32.655
- and he didn't even react?
- I've never seen him with a girl.

05:32.688 --> 05:35.292
I mean, he never goes out,
not even with the team, so...

05:35.325 --> 05:37.595
Yeah, well,
maybe he's super brainy

05:37.628 --> 05:39.229
and spends
all his time studying.

05:39.261 --> 05:41.064
Like little Miss Physics here.

05:42.198 --> 05:43.900
He's hot as hell

05:43.934 --> 05:46.869
and he's Italian too.

05:46.902 --> 05:49.607
Would you really date a guy
like that, though?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.741
- Thank you.
- I wouldn't have to marry him.

05:51.775 --> 05:53.710
I'd be fine
with a good one-night stand.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.746
Jesus, you're worse than a guy.

05:56.780 --> 05:59.616
Let me remind you that there
is this thing called "equality"

05:59.650 --> 06:01.217
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- Right.

06:01.251 --> 06:03.821
Anyway, he is
definitely a hothead.

06:03.854 --> 06:05.823
And he better
watch his mouth too.

06:05.855 --> 06:08.958
If he keeps fighting with coach,
he'll never take him to Rome.

06:08.991 --> 06:10.027
When's the meet?

06:10.059 --> 06:11.694
- In two weeks.
- In two weeks.

06:11.727 --> 06:13.830
Oh, so you're
finally bugging off

06:13.864 --> 06:16.866
- and leaving me your girlfriend.
- I'm gonna miss you, baby.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.702
I'm gonna miss you too.

07:01.078 --> 07:02.746
I don't know
who you are anymore

07:02.778 --> 07:04.881
since you've been with him.

07:04.914 --> 07:07.984
What is your problem?
That Steve's a good guy?

07:08.018 --> 07:11.755
That he's not strange and
mysterious enough for you?

07:11.787 --> 07:14.424
- I'm happy.
- No, you're not happy.

07:14.458 --> 07:17.160
You're, like, serene,
which is totally different

07:17.193 --> 07:19.996
and is terribly sad.

07:20.030 --> 07:23.700
Well, happiness in love
is overrated.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.003
Wow, did I...
Did I really just say that?

07:26.035 --> 07:27.704
- Yes!
- I feel guilty!

07:29.472 --> 07:32.876
Well, you know, I hope
the sex is at least...

07:32.909 --> 07:36.080
Sex is also overrated.

07:36.112 --> 07:38.314
Well, that depends
on who you do it with.

07:46.857 --> 07:50.761
- You're a fucking bitch!
- Get in the fucking car

07:50.794 --> 07:53.496
- and get over here!
- What up, dog?

07:53.530 --> 07:55.399
♪ Ice cream,
ice cream Cherry on the top ♪

07:55.431 --> 07:58.402
♪ Who's your best friend?
I forgot ♪

07:58.434 --> 08:00.269
- Hey, monkey!
- Hey!

08:00.302 --> 08:01.971
You finish
all your homework?

08:02.004 --> 08:04.475
Yeah. Well, all except math.

08:04.508 --> 08:06.977
- You're gonna need math.
- When?

08:07.010 --> 08:08.445
When I'm driving cross-country

08:08.477 --> 08:10.446
and you're in charge
of grocery shopping.

08:10.479 --> 08:13.150
- But I'm coming with you.
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

08:13.183 --> 08:14.151
Come on.

08:15.818 --> 08:17.754
But why can't I come?

08:17.787 --> 08:20.490
Gotta do it on my own. It's
kind of a growing experience.

08:20.523 --> 08:22.059
Well, I'm all grown up.

08:22.092 --> 08:24.161
- I could help you.
- Really?

08:24.193 --> 08:25.828
How?

08:25.862 --> 08:27.498
I could tell you
which road to take

08:27.530 --> 08:29.398
- when you're driving.
- How about this?

08:29.431 --> 08:33.369
I'll bring you back a present
from every city I go to. Okay?

08:33.402 --> 08:36.840
- No.
- You wanna help? I have an idea.

08:36.873 --> 08:38.508
How about you set the table?

08:38.542 --> 08:41.244
Fine.

08:41.277 --> 08:44.348
- Thanks, kiddo.
- You're welcome.

09:02.364 --> 09:03.433
Hey, kids.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.003
Hi, Dad.

09:06.036 --> 09:08.405
Sorry I couldn't
get home sooner.

09:08.437 --> 09:10.506
It's okay,
dinner's not ready yet.

09:10.540 --> 09:13.110
If I didn't get
this guy's car fixed by tonight,

09:13.143 --> 09:14.478
he would have lost his shit.

09:17.379 --> 09:18.515
So how did it go today?

09:20.016 --> 09:21.919
How did it go?

09:21.951 --> 09:23.320
Okay.

09:23.353 --> 09:26.824
- Time?
- All right.

09:26.856 --> 09:28.825
But you don't win
with "all right."

09:28.859 --> 09:30.828
Your future depends on this.

09:30.860 --> 09:33.095
I know.
You keep reminding me every day.

09:33.128 --> 09:35.532
You know, since O'Connor left,
I'm working for two.

09:35.565 --> 09:37.200
Either take
your swimming seriously

09:37.234 --> 09:39.168
or you come work for me
at the garage.

09:39.201 --> 09:42.239
Did you ever think that maybe
I'm not good enough?

09:42.272 --> 09:44.041
You wouldn't have
gotten this far.

09:44.074 --> 09:46.844
Yeah. It's never enough for you.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.545
No, it's never enough for you!

09:48.577 --> 09:51.981
You're the one
who's setting the bar so high!

09:52.014 --> 09:54.585
- Roy! We're eating soon.
- Yeah, I'm not hungry.

10:02.658 --> 10:05.162
I wish you guys
wouldn't fight so much.

10:07.162 --> 10:08.198
Yeah, me too.

10:11.234 --> 10:14.071
The repair guy said we
have to replace the heating.

10:14.104 --> 10:16.073
It's broken again.

10:16.105 --> 10:18.609
<i>Relax. I'll be home soon.</i>

10:18.642 --> 10:20.109
<i>I'll get it done.</i>

10:20.143 --> 10:22.144
Daddy, please help us.

10:22.177 --> 10:25.014
We can't live without you.

10:25.047 --> 10:26.883
- <i>I know.</i>
- Oh, and by the way,

10:26.917 --> 10:29.186
Mom cooked tonight.
Can you believe it?

10:29.219 --> 10:30.988
<i>I wouldn't believe it
if I saw it.</i>

10:31.021 --> 10:34.358
Oh, come on, you two.
I did a great job.

10:34.391 --> 10:36.926
Well, except for the vegetables.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.930
<i>Hang in there, Viv. I'll be
back in a couple of days.</i>

10:39.963 --> 10:41.298
<i>You ready for your test?</i>

10:41.330 --> 10:45.668
I'm a little bit nervous.

10:45.701 --> 10:47.571
<i>You just do the best you can.</i>

10:47.604 --> 10:50.340
- Okay, I love you.
- <i>Love you too.</i>

11:49.331 --> 11:51.301
<i>Based on quantum physics,</i>

11:51.334 --> 11:54.171
<i>particles that have spent
some time together,</i>

11:54.204 --> 11:56.440
<i>once they interact
with their environment,</i>

11:56.473 --> 12:00.243
<i>they go back to being
independent, separate</i>

12:00.276 --> 12:03.280
<i>and apparently more distant
from each other.</i>

12:07.249 --> 12:11.455
<i>The connection between
these particles is so strong</i>

12:11.488 --> 12:15.058
<i>that the moment something
happens to one of them,</i>

12:15.090 --> 12:17.393
<i>the other one feels it.</i>

14:16.513 --> 14:19.249
Honey,
don't wait up for me tonight.

14:19.282 --> 14:21.417
I'm meeting with some clients.

14:24.888 --> 14:26.223
Okay.

14:58.955 --> 15:00.523
- I was a dick last night.
- Yeah.

15:00.556 --> 15:02.526
I was gonna
text you earlier, I...

15:05.662 --> 15:07.364
But you didn't.

15:07.397 --> 15:09.166
No.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.835
I really, really needed you
last night,

15:12.869 --> 15:14.838
like I needed you
the night before that

15:14.870 --> 15:16.472
and the night before that.

15:16.505 --> 15:18.641
I'm sorry.
I was busy training.

15:18.675 --> 15:20.577
You're always busy.

15:20.609 --> 15:22.645
I'm always busy
with quantum physics,

15:22.678 --> 15:25.314
and I still find time for you.

15:25.348 --> 15:27.817
I know. You're right. I just...

15:27.850 --> 15:29.552
I got the big meet coming up

15:29.585 --> 15:31.754
and I'm under
a lot of pressure, you know?

15:33.489 --> 15:36.160
How about you?
How's the prep coming along?

15:39.394 --> 15:45.301
Quantum physics is
fascinating and complicated...

15:45.335 --> 15:47.836
and so exhausting.

15:47.869 --> 15:49.605
You don't have
to know everything

15:49.638 --> 15:53.310
- before you go to college.
- I have to know enough to get in.

15:54.610 --> 15:55.778
I feel like...

15:58.013 --> 16:01.917
all I do is study,
and I'm still not ready.

16:01.950 --> 16:03.619
I'm sure you are. Come here.

17:24.965 --> 17:27.368
I'm a fucking gangster,
that's how I fucking roll!

17:27.403 --> 17:29.639
Somebody explain to me what
the fuck happened right now!

17:29.671 --> 17:31.674
What are you talking about?

17:31.707 --> 17:33.575
- Where the fuck are my drugs?
- What you talking about?

17:33.609 --> 17:35.912
- My drugs!
- Chill the fuck out!

17:35.945 --> 17:37.746
- What are you tripping over?
- Whoa, whoa!

17:37.780 --> 17:40.417
- What the fuck is your problem?
- Ooh, shit.

17:40.449 --> 17:42.751
- You looking for someone?
- Uh...

17:42.784 --> 17:44.353
- Fine-ass red hair.
- What?

17:44.387 --> 17:46.388
- That's a nice coat.
- She's a rich bitch.

17:46.421 --> 17:49.091
That's a nice bag, huh? Uh-uh.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.994
Oh, rich girl. She wanna play.

17:52.028 --> 17:55.098
Come on, let's play a game.
Come on, catch it.

17:55.130 --> 17:56.999
Oh! Just catch it.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.369
It's not that hard.
Just catch it, girl.

17:59.401 --> 18:03.505
- We're just playing with you.
- Grab his ass, girl.

18:03.539 --> 18:05.709
- Give it back.
- You don't need your bag.

18:05.742 --> 18:07.476
- I got something for you.
- Don't hold it too long.

18:07.510 --> 18:09.979
- Chill with us, baby!
- Oh, hey!

18:10.012 --> 18:12.816
Let me see, let me see,
let me see.

18:12.849 --> 18:15.784
- Leave her alone, bro.
- Hey, you kept us waiting, bro!

18:15.818 --> 18:18.388
How are you?
How are you doing?

18:18.420 --> 18:20.956
- We're just having fun.
- I said, leave her alone.

18:20.990 --> 18:23.526
- We're just having fun.
- Give me the fucking bag.

18:23.559 --> 18:25.428
Here, just take her bag.

18:27.129 --> 18:28.764
This is yours.

18:28.798 --> 18:30.032
Thank you.

18:37.607 --> 18:40.644
- Can I call you a ride?
- No, I got it, thanks.

18:44.446 --> 18:46.582
This is no place
for girls like you.

18:48.517 --> 18:50.753
What do you even mean by that,
"girls like me"?

18:50.786 --> 18:52.554
You don't even know me.

18:52.588 --> 18:55.591
I don't know you,
but I know your boyfriend.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.627
He wouldn't like you to be here.

19:00.495 --> 19:03.966
Well, can you just not tell him
that you saw me here, please?

19:06.002 --> 19:07.436
We're cool.

21:14.664 --> 21:15.898
You're early.

21:17.032 --> 21:19.668
Oh, what's up?

21:19.702 --> 21:23.673
What is the strongest thing
you have?

21:23.705 --> 21:25.774
Oh, you're drinking now?

21:25.808 --> 21:27.676
Tonight, I drink.

21:27.709 --> 21:29.611
Okay, then.

21:29.645 --> 21:31.915
Vodka, straight from Ukraine.

21:31.947 --> 21:35.817
I think my dad brought it back
the last time he went there.

21:35.850 --> 21:39.321
Uh, yeah, maybe not straight.

21:39.355 --> 21:41.824
- Yeah...
- It so hurts.

21:41.857 --> 21:43.593
- Oh, my God!
- Give it here.

21:43.626 --> 21:45.595
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna get you

21:45.628 --> 21:47.563
some water with that.

21:49.764 --> 21:52.301
Wow, your place
looks literally amazing.

21:52.334 --> 21:57.206
Thank you. I wanted to go
for lights and mystery.

22:06.881 --> 22:08.051
Okay.

22:13.121 --> 22:14.157
What's wrong?

22:18.224 --> 22:18.661
Nothing's wrong.

22:20.896 --> 22:23.866
Roy, will you read me a story?

22:23.898 --> 22:26.636
One of those old ones
about animals?

22:29.105 --> 22:31.975
All right.
But not too many questions

22:32.007 --> 22:34.076
or I'll turn off the lights

22:34.109 --> 22:36.178
and no more fairy tales.

22:36.212 --> 22:37.847
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

22:37.879 --> 22:40.617
"The cicada and the ant.

22:42.818 --> 22:45.855
The cicada sings in the sun.

22:45.888 --> 22:47.389
The ant works."

22:47.423 --> 22:49.759
Did Mom ever read you stories?

22:51.260 --> 22:53.229
Of course she did.

22:53.262 --> 22:56.733
Well, did she ever read
from this book?

22:56.765 --> 23:00.102
Well, it wasn't the same book,
but it was the same story.

23:00.136 --> 23:02.939
She used to read it when she
was a little girl your age.

23:07.142 --> 23:09.411
"The cicada wants to play.

23:09.445 --> 23:11.348
'But I can't, ' says the ant.

23:13.049 --> 23:15.184
'I need food for the winter.'"

23:15.216 --> 23:16.820
Do you miss her?

23:26.195 --> 23:28.164
I miss her as much as you do.

23:34.235 --> 23:36.305
But that's
enough questions, okay?

23:45.080 --> 23:47.417
"The cicada wants to play.

23:47.449 --> 23:50.385
'But I can't, ' says the ant.

23:50.418 --> 23:53.355
'I need food for the winter.'

23:53.388 --> 23:56.292
'But it's summer, '
says the cicada.

23:56.324 --> 24:01.063
'Winter will come, and you
will be hungry, ' says the ant.

24:01.097 --> 24:02.799
But the cicada sings

24:02.831 --> 24:05.801
and the ant carries
more and more corn."

24:32.794 --> 24:37.734
No, no, that's not right.

24:39.467 --> 24:42.839
Too pink, too long.

24:42.871 --> 24:44.840
So, what am I supposed to be?

24:44.873 --> 24:47.242
I think
you should wear this one.

24:47.275 --> 24:49.745
It's a sexy cop outfit.

24:51.981 --> 24:53.782
Isn't it like too tight?

24:53.815 --> 24:55.050
Yeah, that's the point.

25:10.965 --> 25:13.002
I swear,
I don't wanna be with her.

25:13.034 --> 25:14.836
You sure about that?
I don't know.

25:14.869 --> 25:17.340
Maybe you're the one
that's scared, huh? Heh-heh.

25:17.372 --> 25:19.307
How's it going in college?

25:19.340 --> 25:21.944
I like it better here with you.

25:21.976 --> 25:24.213
Do you wanna come
over to my place later?

25:24.245 --> 25:26.916
I can't, there's a big
party, everyone's going.

25:26.948 --> 25:28.183
The guys from my dorm.

25:28.216 --> 25:30.352
I'm starting to like this.

25:30.386 --> 25:32.555
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

25:32.588 --> 25:35.491
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

25:35.523 --> 25:37.859
You're gonna have to
make up your mind, Steve.

25:37.892 --> 25:40.495
I guess we'll
have to find out tonight.

25:41.863 --> 25:44.167
So you are coming?

25:44.199 --> 25:46.068
Yeah, I might swing by.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.848
Okay, okay, okay.

26:14.929 --> 26:16.264
- Hey.
- Yo.

26:16.298 --> 26:18.167
How long you been
standing there?

26:18.199 --> 26:20.235
A while.

26:20.269 --> 26:22.605
How did you get in?
The pool's closed.

26:22.638 --> 26:24.240
I come here every night.

26:25.407 --> 26:26.542
Why?

26:28.510 --> 26:31.113
You gotta train
if you wanna be number one.

26:31.146 --> 26:33.148
So, uh...

26:33.182 --> 26:35.184
What did you see?

26:35.216 --> 26:36.551
You don't wanna know, bro.

26:36.584 --> 26:40.889
- Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, I... Heh.

26:40.923 --> 26:43.926
I don't wanna tell him you break
into the pool every night.

26:43.958 --> 26:45.393
That's not what I do, you know?

26:45.426 --> 26:47.330
You'd probably get
kicked off the team,

26:47.362 --> 26:50.565
- whole big ordeal, right?
- The fuck are you talking about?

26:50.599 --> 26:52.534
Nothing, man.
I just don't wanna see you

26:52.568 --> 26:55.905
go down like that, that's all.
You're a good swimmer.

26:55.937 --> 26:57.907
I want you on the team.
We need you.

26:57.939 --> 26:59.374
So are we good?

27:04.112 --> 27:06.414
You don't wanna be living
in that trailer-camp shithole

27:06.447 --> 27:07.984
the rest of your life,
do you, Roy?

27:08.016 --> 27:09.384
You don't want
the team to know

27:09.417 --> 27:11.087
you fuck the coach, do you?

27:11.119 --> 27:14.156
Or is it just for that
pretty girl you're dating?

27:14.188 --> 27:18.026
You wanna lose that scholarship?
Huh?

27:18.060 --> 27:20.629
Fuck up any chance you have?

27:20.663 --> 27:22.899
I fucking own you, man!

27:22.932 --> 27:24.934
I fucking own you, motherfucker!

27:24.966 --> 27:26.902
You do what I say
or I'll fuck you up!

27:26.936 --> 27:29.071
You got that, <i>cumpà?</i>

27:31.572 --> 27:34.076
Why don't you
get the fuck out of here?

29:12.174 --> 29:14.609
Who are you?

29:14.642 --> 29:17.012
Show your hands!
You stole my watch!

29:21.250 --> 29:22.585
- Give me my watch!
- What the fuck, man?

29:22.618 --> 29:24.552
- I saw you!
- Back off!

29:24.586 --> 29:25.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

29:25.821 --> 29:27.656
- Hey, Adam! Chill.
- Hey, get out!

29:27.688 --> 29:29.291
- Hey, Adam!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

29:29.323 --> 29:31.060
Take it easy, bro. Take it easy.

29:31.092 --> 29:32.794
Give it here!

29:41.302 --> 29:42.638
Oh, my God! Oh!

29:50.478 --> 29:52.547
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Calm down!

29:55.650 --> 29:57.586
People are calling the cops.
Let's go.

30:11.100 --> 30:14.736
Why do you hang out with
that guy? He's kind of a dick.

30:14.770 --> 30:17.306
I grew up with him.
He did all my tattoos.

30:17.339 --> 30:19.340
I'm stuck with them
like I'm stuck with him.

30:19.373 --> 30:21.676
What age did you get
your first tattoo?

30:21.709 --> 30:26.414
- I was 13. I was just a kid.
- Wow, my goodness.

30:26.447 --> 30:27.816
That must be...

30:27.850 --> 30:31.553
so interesting, growing up
in your neighborhood.

30:32.821 --> 30:35.624
- What were you doing there?
- It's a secret.

30:35.657 --> 30:37.827
What are you, a kid?
You have secrets?

30:37.859 --> 30:40.562
Um... Yes.

30:41.830 --> 30:44.133
How about we play a game?

30:44.166 --> 30:46.534
What kind of game?

30:46.568 --> 30:50.873
Mm, you tell me a secret
and I'll tell you a secret.

30:50.906 --> 30:54.243
Sounds stupid, and
I don't have secrets anyway.

30:57.879 --> 31:01.583
Wow, really?
You don't have one secret?

31:01.617 --> 31:04.153
Not one? Okay, well,
I'll just go, you know,

31:04.186 --> 31:06.554
fuck off with all my honesty.

31:06.588 --> 31:08.090
You go first.

31:10.492 --> 31:15.330
I was supposed to take
a test today, and I didn't.

31:15.363 --> 31:16.631
You go.

31:17.899 --> 31:19.467
Huh.

31:19.501 --> 31:21.904
Every night I go to the pool
and train on my own.

31:21.936 --> 31:24.873
What's the point of training
all night in a pool

31:24.907 --> 31:26.676
if you're not on the team?

31:28.609 --> 31:30.411
What's the point
in studying all day

31:30.445 --> 31:32.115
for a test you won't even take?

31:33.182 --> 31:34.250
Huh?

31:36.752 --> 31:37.853
Touché.

31:37.886 --> 31:39.754
So, what's to like
about physics?

31:39.788 --> 31:44.693
It's so much simpler
than actual life.

31:44.725 --> 31:49.665
I like numbers.
What's your favorite number?

31:49.697 --> 31:50.832
Seven.

31:53.334 --> 31:55.837
Oh, wow. My goodness.

32:00.742 --> 32:04.747
- You're bleeding.
- Really? I didn't notice.

32:06.581 --> 32:08.583
I'm gonna find you some ice.

32:10.484 --> 32:12.420
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

32:30.472 --> 32:33.943
So they didn't have ice, but...

34:40.634 --> 34:42.103
You're an early bird.

34:42.136 --> 34:44.472
The early bird
catches the worm, coach.

34:47.676 --> 34:48.911
If you say so.

34:50.411 --> 34:52.647
I stopped...

34:52.681 --> 34:55.318
I stopped because I thought
I had already blown it.

34:56.784 --> 34:58.053
Has it ever happened to you?

34:59.888 --> 35:01.556
Time me.

35:24.779 --> 35:26.982
You can't believe it,
can you?

35:27.014 --> 35:28.516
How did you do it?

35:29.951 --> 35:33.889
Same way you need to. No fear.

35:33.922 --> 35:36.792
Winning isn't just about talent.

35:36.824 --> 35:38.893
I know you train here
in the middle of the night,

35:38.927 --> 35:41.130
and I admire that,
but it's not gonna matter

35:41.163 --> 35:42.731
if you keep holding back.

35:42.764 --> 35:44.066
Give me a chance.

35:44.098 --> 35:46.033
I'll prove to you I'm worth it.

35:46.067 --> 35:49.571
You gotta beat Steve,
his best time.

35:49.603 --> 35:52.640
If I do, will you put me on the
team and take me to the meet?

35:52.674 --> 35:54.009
Show me you can do it first.

35:54.042 --> 35:57.112
I'm not gonna leave
a winner behind.

35:58.647 --> 35:59.849
All right!

36:01.081 --> 36:02.717
Eight laps, freestyle!

36:04.585 --> 36:05.821
All right!

36:12.493 --> 36:13.428
All right!

36:16.565 --> 36:19.168
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

36:21.002 --> 36:22.871
Good!

36:22.904 --> 36:25.808
I wanna see those flip turns!

36:25.840 --> 36:27.141
Come on!

36:30.811 --> 36:34.516
Steve, Roy, get on the blocks!

36:34.549 --> 36:36.652
Time trial! This is all out!

36:44.759 --> 36:45.994
Ready...

37:17.826 --> 37:19.661
Roy, that is exactly
what I meant.

37:19.694 --> 37:21.596
- Two tenths off the team record.
- Really?

37:21.630 --> 37:22.731
You did good!

37:44.219 --> 37:46.722
Where the fuck were you
last night?

37:46.755 --> 37:48.957
Where the fuck was I?

37:48.989 --> 37:51.893
Where were you? I called you
at least a hundred times.

37:51.927 --> 37:54.596
I was at practice. What?
You don't trust me anymore?

37:56.096 --> 37:58.667
Right now
I don't really trust anyone.

37:58.699 --> 38:00.167
What's wrong with you, Viv?

38:00.201 --> 38:02.571
Lately it's like
you're always somewhere else.

38:02.603 --> 38:05.107
I mean, did you even notice
I just lost my race?

38:05.139 --> 38:08.877
Did you even think
to ask about my test yesterday?

38:11.612 --> 38:14.750
- I forgot.
- Of course you did.

38:14.782 --> 38:16.652
How did it go?

38:16.685 --> 38:19.755
It went
like fucking shit, Steve!

38:19.788 --> 38:21.657
But you wouldn't know

38:21.690 --> 38:24.159
because you never
have time for me anymore.

38:24.192 --> 38:25.894
Listen, I'm sorry
about your test.

38:25.927 --> 38:28.163
And I'm sorry
about last night, okay?

38:28.196 --> 38:30.998
Can we let it go
and fucking move on?

38:31.031 --> 38:33.968
That's all you ever wanna do!

38:34.002 --> 38:36.170
Like, if you don't
fight right now,

38:36.203 --> 38:39.607
Steve, for me and us,
our relationship,

38:39.641 --> 38:42.177
then that's it, then I'm done.

38:45.346 --> 38:47.348
Yo, Roy!
You coming with us, dude?

38:47.382 --> 38:48.317
Yeah, man!

38:52.654 --> 38:54.156
I have to go talk to coach.

39:09.938 --> 39:11.940
You beat him, bro! You beat him!

39:11.973 --> 39:13.175
Great, awesome!

39:20.848 --> 39:25.119
- It's not easy for me, okay?
- It's not easy for me either,

39:25.152 --> 39:26.988
but it's not for much longer.

39:27.022 --> 39:31.360
- What are you guys talking about?
- Hey, honey.

39:33.261 --> 39:34.897
It's so good to see you.

39:36.096 --> 39:39.400
Oh! How did the test go?

39:39.433 --> 39:41.268
I don't wanna talk about it.

39:41.302 --> 39:44.339
Come on, kiddo, I know
it's important for you.

39:44.371 --> 39:47.842
But if you failed,
it's not a big deal, right?

39:47.875 --> 39:49.810
What do you mean,
it's not a big deal?

39:49.844 --> 39:51.947
She's studied the whole year
for this test.

39:51.980 --> 39:55.317
- Do you know how hard it is?
- Do you know how hard it is, Mom?

39:55.350 --> 39:57.985
I've been spending my whole life
thinking about numbers,

39:58.018 --> 40:03.824
and I get there and
all I can think about is you...

40:03.857 --> 40:05.994
fucking your new boyfriend.

40:09.063 --> 40:10.232
Viv...

40:11.366 --> 40:14.902
we've decided to take a break.

40:20.141 --> 40:21.710
Mmm.

40:21.743 --> 40:25.313
What? For how long?

40:25.346 --> 40:27.815
It's been a year.

40:27.848 --> 40:30.451
We wanted to wait for you
to take that test

40:30.485 --> 40:32.921
and go off to college and...

40:32.953 --> 40:37.825
You've been lying to me
for a year?

40:37.859 --> 40:41.163
Is this why you're traveling
so much lately?

40:41.196 --> 40:45.333
Because... Because
you're hiding it from me?

40:45.366 --> 40:48.270
Viv, I'm so sorry.

40:48.302 --> 40:52.139
So you're both liars.
Okay, okay! Good to know.

40:52.172 --> 40:53.808
Viv, wait!

43:37.938 --> 43:39.641
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:39.674 --> 43:43.511
Um, my boyfriend went out
and took his key with him,

43:43.543 --> 43:46.580
and I just forgot something
in his room.

43:46.614 --> 43:49.284
So if I could grab an extra key,
that would be great.

43:49.317 --> 43:50.918
Could you please tell me
his name and room number?

43:50.951 --> 43:53.654
Steve Miller, and, heh,

43:53.688 --> 43:56.958
damn, I forgot the room number.

43:56.991 --> 43:58.326
Jet lag, you know?

43:58.359 --> 44:00.027
Besides his key and room number,

44:00.060 --> 44:02.930
it looks like you forgot
to leave your bags inside.

44:02.964 --> 44:05.032
Should we blame jet lag
for that too?

44:05.065 --> 44:06.935
I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do.

44:06.967 --> 44:08.636
I'm really sorry.
Look, I just...

44:08.670 --> 44:10.338
I've been flying all day

44:10.371 --> 44:12.607
and I really wanna
surprise my boyfriend

44:12.639 --> 44:15.143
and just go say hi
before I leave.

44:15.176 --> 44:17.578
- Steve Miller, you said, right?
- Yeah.

44:17.612 --> 44:20.148
What I can do
is walk you up to his room,

44:20.181 --> 44:22.951
and if he knows who you are
and confirms your story,

44:22.984 --> 44:25.686
then I guess
it won't be a problem.

44:25.719 --> 44:27.555
Thank you! Thank you, thank you.

44:34.628 --> 44:35.964
After you.

44:49.243 --> 44:52.580
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

44:52.612 --> 44:56.051
- What are you doing here?
- Is he your boyfriend?

44:56.083 --> 45:02.056
Yes. Hi. Hi! Babe, surprise!

45:02.089 --> 45:03.657
- Uh...
- Hello.

45:03.690 --> 45:06.660
Okay, here's the key.

45:06.694 --> 45:08.330
Have a pleasant stay.

45:08.362 --> 45:10.397
- Thank you.
- And watch out for that jet lag.

45:10.431 --> 45:12.701
Thank you so much
for all the help.

45:14.601 --> 45:17.404
Oh! Thank you
for playing along with that.

45:17.438 --> 45:20.575
I'm sorry. I've been trying
to surprise Steve

45:20.607 --> 45:22.676
and he wasn't gonna
let me up and...

45:22.710 --> 45:25.981
Yeah, anyways...
Uh, where is Steve's room?

45:26.014 --> 45:29.084
- Steve's room is 511.
- Okay.

45:29.116 --> 45:31.118
- Yeah, just... Yeah.
- Down the hall. Okay.

45:31.152 --> 45:35.623
Okay. I'll just keep
following you, then, heh.

45:35.656 --> 45:38.460
- Yeah, I left something inside.
- Okay.

45:38.493 --> 45:40.594
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay.

45:40.627 --> 45:45.032
Uh, thanks again
for playing along with that.

45:45.065 --> 45:46.968
Oh, that's fine.

47:46.487 --> 47:47.489
Surpr...

47:48.889 --> 47:50.324
Everything okay?

47:50.357 --> 47:52.860
Yeah, do you know
where Steve is?

47:54.427 --> 47:56.196
He was at practice this morning,

47:56.230 --> 47:58.199
but I don't know where he went.

47:58.232 --> 47:59.434
Wanna go for a walk?

47:59.467 --> 48:01.269
I know some really dope places.

48:02.469 --> 48:05.739
- It depends.
- It depends on what?

48:05.772 --> 48:11.445
If you're going to dump me
as soon as I'm getting you ice,

48:11.478 --> 48:15.282
- which I think is very nice.
- Yes, um...

48:15.315 --> 48:18.752
About that... I think
I can make it up to you.

48:18.786 --> 48:20.355
I'm sure.

48:20.388 --> 48:23.690
Come on.
We can have some fun.

48:23.723 --> 48:25.259
Okay.

48:31.232 --> 48:35.302
I'm so excited to see all the
photos you've taken from today.

48:35.335 --> 48:37.839
Did you get any good ones of me?

48:37.871 --> 48:39.741
I hardly ever
take pictures of people.

48:39.773 --> 48:42.576
So does that mean I've been
posing this entire time

48:42.610 --> 48:44.878
and you don't have
one photo of me?

48:44.911 --> 48:47.714
I take pictures
of places I find interesting.

48:47.748 --> 48:50.451
So is it just people
you don't find interesting

48:50.484 --> 48:52.619
or is it just me?

48:52.652 --> 48:56.590
No, I do. I just don't need
pictures to prove it.

48:56.623 --> 48:59.259
It's not about proving anything,

48:59.293 --> 49:01.763
it's about
keeping the people you love

49:01.795 --> 49:04.631
close to you at all times.

49:04.665 --> 49:08.636
People I love are always
with me. I keep them inside.

49:08.668 --> 49:12.206
Ah, okay, but your brain
can't store all your memories

49:12.239 --> 49:13.607
since you were born.

49:13.641 --> 49:15.843
Thank God.

49:15.875 --> 49:17.611
So how are you
supposed to remember

49:17.645 --> 49:19.947
this amazing day
we've spent together?

49:19.980 --> 49:22.549
Who says
I wanna remember it, huh?

49:22.583 --> 49:23.851
Can you please

49:23.884 --> 49:25.353
move out of the frame?

49:27.888 --> 49:30.290
Hey! That's not fair.

49:30.324 --> 49:32.327
- What are you doing?
- Got you! Got you! It's mine!

49:41.002 --> 49:43.638
Whoa! You can't catch me!

49:44.839 --> 49:46.574
Hey, hey, hey!

50:00.788 --> 50:04.859
Should we go...
Um, should we walk around it?

50:07.627 --> 50:09.796
How long did you live here for?

50:09.830 --> 50:11.498
Till the end of middle school.

50:11.531 --> 50:13.700
Then my dad wanted to move
back to the States.

50:13.734 --> 50:17.505
But didn't you want
to stay here?

50:17.538 --> 50:22.476
Yes, no. It's... It's a long
story. You don't wanna hear it.

50:22.509 --> 50:24.645
How about
you climb up the steps

50:24.679 --> 50:26.848
and look back
only when I tell you?

50:26.880 --> 50:29.449
- Why?
- Just trust me.

50:29.482 --> 50:31.385
Why would I trust you?

50:31.418 --> 50:34.556
I'll tell you a story about
trust my mom used to tell me.

50:38.625 --> 50:40.961
A long time ago,
there was this guy.

50:40.994 --> 50:44.364
His name was Orpheus,
and he was madly in love

50:44.397 --> 50:46.967
with this beautiful nymph,
Eurydice.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.504
She's hot. Like, she's fire,
but one day she dies.

50:50.538 --> 50:52.407
- What?
- So he makes a deal

50:52.440 --> 50:54.909
- with the king of the underworld.
- What kind of deal?

50:54.942 --> 50:58.012
He can bring her back to life
on one condition:

50:58.045 --> 51:02.050
On the way out, he can't look
at her, he can't turn around.

51:02.083 --> 51:04.085
So she's right behind him
the whole time.

51:04.118 --> 51:05.920
She knows nothing
about this deal.

51:05.953 --> 51:08.790
So, what,
she starts talking to him?

51:08.822 --> 51:10.090
Much worse.

51:10.123 --> 51:12.592
She keeps
calling out his name.

51:12.625 --> 51:15.763
"Orpheus. Orpheus."

51:20.400 --> 51:21.869
Now, close your eyes.

51:23.404 --> 51:25.407
Where are you taking me?

51:26.674 --> 51:28.310
Out of the underworld.

51:38.886 --> 51:41.355
♪ I love you, baby ♪

51:41.389 --> 51:45.026
♪ And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby ♪

51:45.058 --> 51:47.060
♪ To warm the lonely nights ♪

51:47.094 --> 51:49.731
♪ I love you, baby ♪

51:49.764 --> 51:53.701
♪ Trust in me when I say ♪

51:53.734 --> 51:56.436
♪ Oh, pretty baby... ♪

51:56.469 --> 51:58.438
Okay, there is a step now.
There is a step.

51:58.471 --> 52:00.607
One... Another step.
Yes. Okay.

52:03.576 --> 52:05.679
Now you can open your eyes.

52:39.813 --> 52:42.783
So you never even
told me how the story ends.

52:42.817 --> 52:45.920
- What story?
- Orpheus.

52:45.953 --> 52:47.855
Oh. Yeah.

52:47.888 --> 52:50.424
Right at the end,
Eurydice falls silent,

52:50.458 --> 52:52.460
so he turns around and looks.

52:52.493 --> 52:55.196
- And what happens to her?
- She's gone.

52:56.663 --> 52:58.832
Greek mythology is fucked up.

52:58.866 --> 53:00.967
No, that's love.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.170
Life pulls people apart
and love ends.

53:03.203 --> 53:05.739
It can't last forever.

53:07.674 --> 53:10.177
You are such a pessimist,
but I'm a numbers girl,

53:10.210 --> 53:12.846
so I kind of respect it.

53:12.880 --> 53:15.583
What's math got to do with love?

53:15.616 --> 53:20.888
Well, there's all these numbers
that surround the word "love,"

53:20.920 --> 53:26.060
and it used to make
so much sense to me, and I...

53:28.094 --> 53:29.464
Now I'm not so sure.

53:31.632 --> 53:33.134
Do you believe in love?

53:34.768 --> 53:35.970
Yes, I do.

53:37.837 --> 53:39.706
I just don't want it.

53:52.685 --> 53:54.688
Do you mind calling Steve again

53:54.721 --> 53:56.656
and seeing
if he answers this time?

53:56.690 --> 53:58.193
Sure, sure.

54:15.643 --> 54:16.644
He's not answering.

54:20.214 --> 54:22.549
You wanna grab a drink?

54:22.583 --> 54:23.685
I owe you one.

54:51.978 --> 54:56.750
So why are obtuse angles
so depressed?

54:56.784 --> 55:00.821
- Why?
- Because they're never right!

55:02.623 --> 55:04.891
- You get it, right? Because...
- I... I got it.

55:04.924 --> 55:06.259
Why aren't you laughing?

55:06.293 --> 55:08.696
Like, he doesn't love,
he doesn't laugh, he...

55:10.730 --> 55:12.832
That's the funniest thing
you've done today!

55:12.866 --> 55:15.636
- I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.
- No worries, it happens.

55:15.668 --> 55:17.638
I'm such a klutz when I drink.

55:17.670 --> 55:21.875
- Two more margaritas, please.
- Are you guests at our hotel?

55:21.909 --> 55:23.878
Oh, yes. Room 222.

55:25.179 --> 55:28.749
What if she finds out?

55:28.781 --> 55:30.350
I have a plan.

55:30.384 --> 55:32.820
Thank you! I'm sorry again,
by the way.

55:32.853 --> 55:34.655
- No worries.
- Cheers.

55:34.688 --> 55:36.691
Cheers.

55:36.723 --> 55:39.793
We change location
without attracting attention.

55:43.931 --> 55:45.166
That's worse!

55:45.199 --> 55:47.101
I feel like
this is really stealth.

55:50.304 --> 55:52.639
You're making me drink
the day before the meet.

55:52.672 --> 55:56.810
I'm not making you do anything
you wouldn't already be doing.

55:56.844 --> 55:58.145
I'm not sure about that.

55:58.177 --> 56:00.246
So are you nervous
about the meet tomorrow?

56:00.279 --> 56:03.750
Why should I be?
I'm not gonna win it.

56:03.784 --> 56:05.753
But you won last time.

56:05.786 --> 56:07.855
Winning a one-time trial
is no big deal.

56:09.656 --> 56:11.992
Everybody gets lucky
sooner or later.

56:12.025 --> 56:16.029
Wow! Are you always
so supportive of yourself?

56:16.063 --> 56:18.766
Only when you're around.

56:18.799 --> 56:20.900
So, what are you gonna do
if you win?

56:20.933 --> 56:25.872
If I do win, my dad's gonna find
another reason to give me shit.

56:25.906 --> 56:29.777
What about your mom? I'm asking
because mine lately is...

56:29.810 --> 56:31.012
Mine is dead.

56:34.380 --> 56:35.750
I'm so sorry, Roy.

56:35.782 --> 56:37.083
- I...
- That's okay.

56:37.116 --> 56:38.952
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

56:38.985 --> 56:41.221
It's okay,
it was a long time ago.

56:41.255 --> 56:44.025
Actually, she taught me
how to swim.

56:49.228 --> 56:52.000
Can I ask how it happened?

57:01.808 --> 57:06.046
We were on vacation, and my dad
and my sister went for a walk.

57:08.315 --> 57:10.818
My mom was swimming in...
In the sea.

57:12.286 --> 57:14.355
Something went wrong.

57:14.388 --> 57:16.223
She must have blacked out.

57:16.255 --> 57:18.393
She couldn't get back to shore.

57:23.130 --> 57:25.166
I... I tried to get to her.

57:31.138 --> 57:33.040
I tried and I failed.

57:35.509 --> 57:37.311
I'm so sorry.

57:49.522 --> 57:51.191
222's empty.

57:52.359 --> 57:53.761
Wait, what's happening?

57:53.793 --> 57:55.196
- Hey, they're skipping out.
- Escape!

57:55.228 --> 57:56.931
- Go, go, go!
- What? We're leaving?

57:56.964 --> 57:58.799
- Stop them!
- Oh, my God!

58:00.900 --> 58:02.036
Come on, come on!

59:16.543 --> 59:19.280
YOLO, right? Heh.

59:22.549 --> 59:23.518
Turn around.

59:49.976 --> 59:52.045
Did you really say "YOLO"?

59:54.313 --> 59:56.984
Whatever. You only live once.

59:57.016 --> 59:59.986
If there was ever
a time to use it,

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.089
now would be the time.

01:00:28.047 --> 01:00:32.018
Did you know
that chlorine is the main...

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.142
We should go...

01:00:57.543 --> 01:00:59.614
before we get in trouble.

01:01:16.295 --> 01:01:19.332
So I...

01:01:19.366 --> 01:01:21.302
I guess it's good night.

01:01:21.335 --> 01:01:22.503
Yeah.

01:01:24.036 --> 01:01:26.072
I had fun.

01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:29.476
Um... I... I did too.

01:01:33.547 --> 01:01:36.016
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.137
Baby, it's not
what it looks like.

01:01:57.337 --> 01:01:58.605
- What...?
- I can explain.

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.409
Viv?

01:02:06.746 --> 01:02:08.081
Did you know?

01:02:09.715 --> 01:02:13.520
Viv... Viv, wait!

01:02:20.226 --> 01:02:21.561
Leave me alone!

01:02:25.565 --> 01:02:29.235
- Leave me alone, Roy, seriously!
- Vivien. Vivien.

01:02:29.268 --> 01:02:31.671
Fuck you!

01:02:31.705 --> 01:02:35.009
- Please, stop. Please.
- I don't wanna talk to you!

01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:37.643
- Leave me alone! You get it?
- Please, calm down.

01:02:37.677 --> 01:02:39.380
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Calm down!

01:02:39.413 --> 01:02:41.048
Why didn't you tell me?!

01:02:43.315 --> 01:02:46.085
What was I supposed to do?

01:02:46.118 --> 01:02:50.089
You were supposed to tell me
the truth! What do you think?

01:02:50.123 --> 01:02:52.793
Were you trying to use this
to your advantage?

01:02:52.826 --> 01:02:55.596
What was that?
Like we... We go out,

01:02:55.628 --> 01:02:58.498
we get drunk
and then you kiss me?!

01:02:58.531 --> 01:03:00.400
- Huh? What was that about?
- Oh, come on!

01:03:00.433 --> 01:03:03.669
You wanted the kiss
as bad as me! You wanted it!

01:03:03.703 --> 01:03:06.105
Is it my fucking fault if
your boyfriend cheats on you?

01:03:06.139 --> 01:03:09.109
Is it my fault
if you find out? Is it?!

01:03:09.141 --> 01:03:11.210
And that whole story
about trust?

01:03:11.243 --> 01:03:15.815
I could never
trust someone like you!

01:03:15.848 --> 01:03:18.351
What'd you think was gonna
happen after you kissed me?

01:03:18.384 --> 01:03:20.821
That we would just be
happily ever after?

01:03:20.853 --> 01:03:23.756
I could never be
with someone like you!

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:26.226
Someone who tries and fails!

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.768
Fuck.

01:03:37.436 --> 01:03:39.040
Roy!

01:03:42.174 --> 01:03:44.811
- Roy!
- Fuck off!

01:03:44.844 --> 01:03:48.114
Hey, I'm sorry!
I didn't mean that, okay?

01:03:48.147 --> 01:03:50.650
I didn't wanna say that!
I'm sorry! I...

01:03:53.353 --> 01:03:54.722
Vivien!

01:05:23.944 --> 01:05:26.380
How did they get her
back here?

01:05:26.413 --> 01:05:27.880
Luckily she was stable,

01:05:27.913 --> 01:05:29.883
so they could put her
on a plane.

01:05:31.284 --> 01:05:33.587
The doctors in Rome okayed it.

01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:35.822
How come you guys
weren't together?

01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:40.527
The meet was the next day,
I couldn't go out.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.697
Yeah, but Roy was out with
Vivien, so where were you?

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:47.735
What happened that night?

01:05:49.335 --> 01:05:50.471
I don't know.

01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:55.274
I can't figure out
why they were together.

01:05:55.308 --> 01:05:58.978
- Did you have a fight? Or...
- We had dinner.

01:05:59.011 --> 01:06:01.915
I was tired and focused on the
meet, so I went to bed early.

01:06:03.315 --> 01:06:04.951
I should have been there!

01:06:07.386 --> 01:06:08.555
I should have been there.

01:06:10.956 --> 01:06:14.860
Unfortunately, she suffered
a serious concussion.

01:06:14.893 --> 01:06:17.464
But the good news is
that her CAT scan shows

01:06:17.496 --> 01:06:20.766
no cerebral lesions
or focal neurological signs.

01:06:20.799 --> 01:06:23.269
And she's got
no significant injuries.

01:06:23.302 --> 01:06:25.339
- So we can hope she'll wake up?
- Of course.

01:06:25.371 --> 01:06:27.607
She's young and strong.

01:06:27.641 --> 01:06:29.543
How long will it take?

01:06:29.576 --> 01:06:31.778
I'm afraid
I don't have the answer to that.

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:35.481
All we can do is continue
to monitor her condition.

01:06:35.514 --> 01:06:37.717
Let's be optimistic.

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.386
We'll get through this, okay?

01:07:08.514 --> 01:07:09.850
Oh, hand me a 13.

01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:25.632
I said 13. This is an 18.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.476
No, don't worry, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

01:07:40.846 --> 01:07:42.482
Let's take a break.

01:07:42.514 --> 01:07:45.051
We've been at this for hours.
Go get two beers.

01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:59.433
Coach passed by yesterday.

01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.569
He said he hasn't
seen you in a while.

01:08:04.371 --> 01:08:05.739
You really wanna quit?

01:08:07.607 --> 01:08:09.676
The team won anyway.

01:08:09.708 --> 01:08:10.877
They don't need me.

01:08:12.444 --> 01:08:14.113
What's the point
of fighting for something

01:08:14.147 --> 01:08:15.782
that's gonna get me nowhere?

01:08:18.151 --> 01:08:20.087
All right, listen.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.788
What I'm about to tell you
goes against my own interests,

01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:24.622
because since
you've been helping out,

01:08:24.656 --> 01:08:26.692
work's gotten a lot easier.

01:08:26.725 --> 01:08:28.728
But shouldn't you take
some time to think this over?

01:08:28.761 --> 01:08:30.663
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:08:30.696 --> 01:08:32.865
You beg me for years to come
and help you in the shop.

01:08:32.898 --> 01:08:35.968
Now I'm here, you tell me
to think it over?!

01:08:36.002 --> 01:08:37.837
Are you fucking crazy?

01:08:40.506 --> 01:08:43.377
I don't want you
to rush this decision, okay?

01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:44.978
I told you, Dad. I'm done.

01:08:51.183 --> 01:08:52.453
Roy!

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.856
How's the girl doing?

01:08:58.825 --> 01:08:59.827
She's stable...

01:09:01.861 --> 01:09:03.663
but she's lost somewhere.

01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:12.071
I'll finish up.
Go on, get out of here.

01:10:20.072 --> 01:10:22.875
- Visiting times are over.
- I know.

01:10:22.909 --> 01:10:24.844
So why do you
always come so late?

01:10:24.878 --> 01:10:26.580
I've got a job.

01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:31.685
Is she your girlfriend?

01:10:41.093 --> 01:10:42.562
You've got five minutes.

01:10:46.132 --> 01:10:47.901
She's not my girlfriend.

01:13:13.413 --> 01:13:14.848
Vivien?

01:13:16.348 --> 01:13:17.817
How are you feeling?

01:13:19.017 --> 01:13:20.386
Can you hear me?

01:13:22.789 --> 01:13:24.758
Can you please follow my finger?

01:13:29.262 --> 01:13:30.364
Good.

01:13:38.471 --> 01:13:41.308
Do you remember
anything about that night?

01:13:43.241 --> 01:13:45.978
I mean, uh,
the night of the accident.

01:13:49.014 --> 01:13:54.186
I don't remember,
um, anything.

01:13:55.855 --> 01:13:58.223
You went to see
your boyfriend Steve.

01:13:58.257 --> 01:14:00.125
Do you know who Steve is?

01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:04.097
- Yes, I know who Steve is.
- Okay.

01:14:04.129 --> 01:14:09.935
Um, could you please draw two
triangles with the same base?

01:14:26.352 --> 01:14:29.822
- It's kind of wonky.
- Heh, well, thank you, Vivien.

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.860
Will I be the same me...

01:14:34.893 --> 01:14:36.730
as I was...

01:14:36.762 --> 01:14:38.831
before everything?

01:14:38.865 --> 01:14:41.101
Well, you're making
great progress

01:14:41.133 --> 01:14:43.069
and we think
you're gonna be fine.

01:14:43.102 --> 01:14:46.139
But it may take a little time,

01:14:46.172 --> 01:14:49.342
so you'll need to be
patient, okay?

01:14:54.446 --> 01:14:55.414
Okay.

01:14:56.481 --> 01:14:57.950
Vivien is doing fine.

01:14:59.317 --> 01:15:01.020
However, as we suspected,

01:15:01.053 --> 01:15:02.989
there's a gap
in her short-term memory.

01:15:03.021 --> 01:15:05.124
This is pretty common
in patients

01:15:05.157 --> 01:15:08.194
who experience
this kind of trauma.

01:15:08.227 --> 01:15:10.096
So we'll need to take
some precautions

01:15:10.129 --> 01:15:12.866
- in dealing with her condition.
- What kind of precautions?

01:15:12.898 --> 01:15:14.267
Let her rest.

01:15:14.299 --> 01:15:17.003
Don't try to force her
to remember what happened.

01:15:17.035 --> 01:15:19.038
And don't worry
if she seems confused

01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:20.873
when she talks about it.

01:15:20.906 --> 01:15:23.843
Just let her work it through.

01:15:25.277 --> 01:15:26.847
Take her home.

01:15:30.249 --> 01:15:32.152
She's doing well!

01:15:36.588 --> 01:15:38.057
We all are.

01:17:12.651 --> 01:17:14.186
How are you feeling?

01:17:15.922 --> 01:17:18.290
- Better. Yeah.
- Mm?

01:17:18.324 --> 01:17:21.227
- I feel... I'm feeling good, yeah.
- Yeah?

01:17:21.259 --> 01:17:23.428
So fill me in.

01:17:23.462 --> 01:17:29.569
Did you see anything
or feel anything?

01:17:29.602 --> 01:17:34.907
When I woke up, I felt,
um, like, a presence.

01:17:36.475 --> 01:17:38.611
- Yeah, the brain's so weird.
- Heh, yeah.

01:17:38.643 --> 01:17:41.313
- It's a crazy place.
- Here you go, baby.

01:17:41.347 --> 01:17:42.514
Hey.

01:17:44.215 --> 01:17:46.186
- For you.
- Thanks.

01:17:50.021 --> 01:17:54.493
Did you take photos of us
that night, right?

01:17:54.526 --> 01:17:56.929
With a Polaroid camera?

01:17:56.963 --> 01:18:01.234
Yeah, but, um, I left them
at the hotel.

01:18:01.267 --> 01:18:06.139
Everything got so crazy so fast,
I just forgot them in the room.

01:18:06.172 --> 01:18:08.607
Really? 'Cause I...
That's too bad.

01:18:08.641 --> 01:18:11.611
- Look, I found one.
- Oh, yeah.

01:18:11.643 --> 01:18:13.213
It's cute.

01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:19.352
Yeah, this is, um...

01:18:21.587 --> 01:18:24.691
You know, that night, um,

01:18:24.723 --> 01:18:26.993
I was so afraid
that I'd lose a lot more

01:18:27.026 --> 01:18:28.395
than just those pictures.

01:18:30.195 --> 01:18:31.597
- I missed you.
- Mmm.

01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:35.167
I missed you too.

01:18:42.074 --> 01:18:43.676
I'm not gonna do anything.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:50.517
Hey! Who are you?
You want a beer?

01:18:52.651 --> 01:18:54.554
You're real hot, you know that?

01:18:54.587 --> 01:18:57.490
What's a princess like you
doing in a shit place like this?

01:18:57.522 --> 01:19:00.493
I'm looking for Roy.
Do you know him?

01:19:00.526 --> 01:19:01.695
Over there.

01:19:02.794 --> 01:19:05.464
He always gets the hotties.

01:19:05.498 --> 01:19:07.200
Come see me later!

01:19:13.271 --> 01:19:15.140
What do you want?

01:19:15.173 --> 01:19:18.710
Did you take any Polaroids of
Vivien the day of the accident?

01:19:18.744 --> 01:19:20.413
Yes, why?

01:19:20.445 --> 01:19:23.482
And was one of those
a picture of her in a park?

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:29.088
- Yes. Why are you asking?
- She woke up, Roy.

01:19:31.289 --> 01:19:33.725
How is she doing?
Is she home?

01:19:33.758 --> 01:19:37.796
Yeah, but she's remembering
a bunch of strange stuff.

01:19:37.829 --> 01:19:41.299
And she's convinced that
she was with Steve that night.

01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:43.803
And Steve is telling
the same story.

01:19:43.835 --> 01:19:45.471
Did you tell her anything?

01:19:45.504 --> 01:19:48.541
- No, she was already upset.
- So don't.

01:19:50.109 --> 01:19:52.411
Wait, you're giving up
on her? Just like that?

01:19:53.678 --> 01:19:54.813
It's best for everyone.

01:19:54.847 --> 01:19:57.784
Are you scared of
how she'll take it?

01:19:57.816 --> 01:19:59.484
- No.
- Oh, don't tell me

01:19:59.517 --> 01:20:01.721
- you're trying to protect Steve.
- Fuck Steve!

01:20:01.754 --> 01:20:03.523
Well, then why?

01:20:03.556 --> 01:20:05.590
'Cause I almost killed her,
Christine.

01:20:05.624 --> 01:20:08.127
Because every time
I get close to someone I love,

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.730
it ends up in disaster.
I get there too late.

01:20:10.762 --> 01:20:14.800
But this time, I can go away
before I fuck it up.

01:20:14.834 --> 01:20:17.270
What happened between
the two of you that night?

01:20:18.471 --> 01:20:20.540
It's complicated.

01:20:20.572 --> 01:20:24.110
- But something happened.
- Yes, and it shouldn't have.

01:21:15.861 --> 01:21:17.363
What's wrong?

01:21:20.633 --> 01:21:21.768
She woke up.

01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:24.770
What did I tell you?

01:21:24.803 --> 01:21:26.372
It was just a matter of time.

01:21:28.574 --> 01:21:29.776
Roy.

01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:34.446
It wasn't your fault.

01:21:35.847 --> 01:21:37.616
I'll never forgive myself.

01:21:39.285 --> 01:21:41.354
I'm the one
you have to forgive.

01:21:42.721 --> 01:21:45.424
It's like I drowned with her
that day.

01:21:47.793 --> 01:21:50.130
I tried to forget, but I can't.

01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:55.400
I, too, was afraid of moving on,
of standing around

01:21:55.433 --> 01:21:58.737
while you're stuck with this
guilt that's not yours to bear!

01:22:10.348 --> 01:22:11.650
I'm sorry.

01:22:21.794 --> 01:22:23.830
You have to make up your mind.

01:22:26.632 --> 01:22:27.834
Okay?

01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:31.737
Don't be the fuckup I've been.

01:22:33.271 --> 01:22:35.374
This is what I'm trying
to tell you.

01:22:40.478 --> 01:22:41.880
Come here.

01:22:49.588 --> 01:22:52.425
I tried to get her
all shiny and new,

01:22:52.458 --> 01:22:55.393
but then you just showed up.

01:22:55.427 --> 01:22:56.795
Take the other side.

01:23:09.842 --> 01:23:11.277
She's yours.

01:23:12.578 --> 01:23:13.780
If it breaks, you fix it.

01:23:21.352 --> 01:23:22.521
You can go now.

01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:26.326
How are you gonna manage
without me?

01:23:27.558 --> 01:23:30.262
Let's just say, uh...

01:23:30.295 --> 01:23:33.865
your relationship with wrenches
has forced me to let you go.

01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:42.475
So I'm fired?

01:23:42.508 --> 01:23:44.911
Yeah. Go hit the road.

01:23:57.789 --> 01:23:59.258
Let's go.

01:24:14.373 --> 01:24:16.808
- Come on, bro.
- It's not fucking opening.

01:24:16.842 --> 01:24:18.009
Fuck yeah.

01:24:18.043 --> 01:24:20.346
- Thank you, man.
- I got your back.

01:24:28.587 --> 01:24:30.455
Thank you, sweetie.

01:24:30.489 --> 01:24:32.859
- Not too much.
- Why not?

01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:37.896
Well, I may be tempted
to take advantage of you!

01:24:37.929 --> 01:24:40.732
- I dare you.
- Watch me.

01:24:48.507 --> 01:24:49.776
What are you eating?

01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:53.679
Mm, fish? Oysters?

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:11.798
Guys, you can stop pretending.

01:25:13.398 --> 01:25:14.933
What are you talking about?

01:25:17.636 --> 01:25:19.672
I know.

01:25:19.704 --> 01:25:21.706
I... I remember.

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:25.077
You don't
have to pretend for me.

01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:26.846
We're not pretending.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.016
I mean, we had
decided to separate,

01:25:31.048 --> 01:25:32.717
that's true.

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:36.054
But after your accident,
we got close again.

01:25:36.088 --> 01:25:41.393
And we realized
that we still need each other.

01:25:41.427 --> 01:25:43.396
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25:43.428 --> 01:25:45.498
We needed someone
in the kitchen.

01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:49.401
- Heh-heh, thank you.
- Really?

01:25:49.435 --> 01:25:51.504
Yes.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.843
- Honey...
- Wow.

01:25:58.477 --> 01:25:59.846
Oh, thank God.

01:26:02.614 --> 01:26:04.549
No, no, no, no....

01:27:09.181 --> 01:27:10.883
Hi, baby!

01:27:10.915 --> 01:27:12.750
This is so sweet.

01:27:12.784 --> 01:27:15.120
Oh, my goodness,
I love the surprise!

01:27:15.152 --> 01:27:18.257
Steve, seriously,
thank you so much!

01:27:18.289 --> 01:27:20.158
So romantic!

01:29:20.379 --> 01:29:23.048
I thought no one was here.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.583
What's going on?

01:29:26.817 --> 01:29:29.722
After everything
that happened, I, uh...

01:29:29.754 --> 01:29:32.790
realized I needed a break.

01:29:32.824 --> 01:29:34.160
Why?

01:29:40.831 --> 01:29:43.768
- I've been struggling.
- Struggling with what?

01:29:45.803 --> 01:29:49.708
Struggling with seeing you
every day, Steve, okay?

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.209
I can't do it anymore.

01:29:54.679 --> 01:29:56.081
What about the team?

01:29:59.316 --> 01:30:00.986
New coach is coming tomorrow.

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.423
I hate goodbyes.

01:30:05.456 --> 01:30:08.628
So you were just gonna disappear
without saying goodbye?

01:30:12.731 --> 01:30:14.032
Goodbye.

01:30:16.468 --> 01:30:17.870
You can't just quit!

01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:21.072
You can't just leave like this!

01:30:23.275 --> 01:30:25.911
Who am I quitting on, Steve?

01:30:28.213 --> 01:30:30.715
The team? Or you?

01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:40.793
Yeah.

01:31:41.253 --> 01:31:43.522
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

01:31:43.554 --> 01:31:45.790
What you up to?

01:31:45.824 --> 01:31:48.794
Were we together
the day of the accident?

01:31:48.826 --> 01:31:51.029
Yeah, of course.
Remember, I told you.

01:31:51.062 --> 01:31:53.365
- Why are you asking?
- 'Cause my brain

01:31:53.397 --> 01:31:55.933
is not as reliable
as it used to be.

01:31:55.967 --> 01:31:59.972
So... I feel like
I just need clarification

01:32:00.004 --> 01:32:02.273
on a couple things.

01:32:02.307 --> 01:32:05.377
- Okay.
- What's happening in this photo?

01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:09.414
That's a, um, fountain
in a square.

01:32:09.446 --> 01:32:11.816
Heh, obviously
it's a fountain in a square,

01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:14.386
but what... What is it
actually a picture of?

01:32:14.419 --> 01:32:16.121
Where are we?

01:32:16.154 --> 01:32:18.022
Why are you being so hostile?

01:32:18.056 --> 01:32:19.792
I'm not being hostile,
I'm just...

01:32:19.825 --> 01:32:22.995
I'm just asking questions.
How did we spend that day?

01:32:23.027 --> 01:32:26.264
Uh, we went for a walk
and had dinner.

01:32:26.298 --> 01:32:28.200
Where did we have dinner?

01:32:28.232 --> 01:32:30.369
The restaurant,
we went to a restaurant.

01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:35.039
Was there a terrace there?

01:32:35.072 --> 01:32:37.276
Yeah, there was, Viv.

01:32:37.308 --> 01:32:38.910
What was I wearing?

01:32:40.579 --> 01:32:44.116
Um, heh,
I can't remember, I don't...

01:32:44.148 --> 01:32:46.017
Are you serious?

01:32:46.051 --> 01:32:50.188
The day I almost died, you can't
remember what I was wearing?

01:32:51.455 --> 01:32:53.458
Are you serious?!

01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:56.261
Why are we not in
any of these pictures?

01:32:57.395 --> 01:32:59.865
Not in one of them.

01:32:59.897 --> 01:33:03.368
Where's any photos of us?
Where's your camera even?

01:33:03.401 --> 01:33:05.971
I told you, I left
everything at the hotel.

01:33:06.004 --> 01:33:08.273
This is crazy, baby. I...

01:33:08.306 --> 01:33:10.209
If you left everything
at the hotel,

01:33:10.241 --> 01:33:12.610
then how did all of these
get here?

01:33:12.643 --> 01:33:14.579
Where did these come from then?

01:33:14.612 --> 01:33:17.182
- You weren't with me!
- Yes, I was.

01:33:17.214 --> 01:33:21.319
No, you weren't!
You were not with me.

01:33:21.352 --> 01:33:23.121
So where were you then?

01:33:24.388 --> 01:33:26.859
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not lying.

01:33:26.892 --> 01:33:28.961
Why are you lying? Why are you
lying to me right now?

01:33:28.994 --> 01:33:31.263
- I'm not lying!
- You're driving me crazy!

01:33:31.295 --> 01:33:33.999
This is already so hard!

01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:37.201
And you're making it so much
harder. Why are you lying?

01:33:37.235 --> 01:33:40.239
Why? Where were you that night?
Where were you that night?

01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:43.542
- Where were you that night?
- I was with Dylan! Okay?

01:33:43.575 --> 01:33:46.111
Okay?

01:33:46.143 --> 01:33:50.014
In Rome, the night of the party,

01:33:50.048 --> 01:33:52.284
for the past three months
and 12 days...

01:33:53.584 --> 01:33:55.320
I was with him, okay?

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:40.398
<i>Trust what you feel.

01:34:40.432 --> 01:34:44.136
<i>Keep walking.
Don't turn around and go on.</i>

01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:46.338
<i>Orpheus.</i>

01:34:47.605 --> 01:34:50.542
<i>I'll be waiting.
401 Edgar Road.</i>

01:35:38.757 --> 01:35:41.093
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:54.172
This is pretty.

01:35:55.406 --> 01:35:58.576
Yeah? You... You like it?

01:36:02.179 --> 01:36:03.281
Mm-hmm.

01:36:04.449 --> 01:36:06.118
Can I take your jacket?

01:36:18.195 --> 01:36:19.530
I missed you.

01:36:21.665 --> 01:36:23.634
It was you...

01:36:23.668 --> 01:36:25.471
when I woke up.

01:36:27.539 --> 01:36:31.309
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:36:31.342 --> 01:36:33.210
I did...

01:36:33.244 --> 01:36:35.380
in my own way.

01:36:35.413 --> 01:36:37.115
I've been thinking
about that kiss

01:36:37.147 --> 01:36:40.618
every second of every day
since it's happened.

01:36:40.651 --> 01:36:45.656
But a lot of things, bad things
happened after that kiss.

01:36:50.195 --> 01:36:52.130
Should we take the risk again?

01:41:33.977 --> 01:41:36.980
<i>The bond between two
particles that have interacted</i>

01:41:37.013 --> 01:41:40.819
<i>is only valid
in the microscopic realm.</i>

01:41:40.852 --> 01:41:43.355
<i>It cannot be applied
to the human world</i>

01:41:43.387 --> 01:41:48.892
<i>because human beings are much

01:41:48.926 --> 01:41:50.861
<i>unpredictable.</i>
