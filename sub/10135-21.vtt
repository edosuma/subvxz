Here come my girls.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.186
And I bet they can't wait

01:40.976 --> 01:43.186
to hug their dad.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.981
Would you tell DJ

01:43.228 --> 01:45.981
to stop hogging the bathroom?

01:46.023 --> 01:48.525
It just so happens

01:46.023 --> 01:48.525

02:09.421 --> 02:11.548
I got to start screening

02:09.421 --> 02:11.548
those junior rangers.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.008
I had a crier, two wetters

02:13.050 --> 02:15.176

02:13.050 --> 02:15.176
a splinter in his butt.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.911
that we use cornstarch

03:22.953 --> 03:24.079
when we diaper the boys.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.914
Ah, but we want

07:38.125 --> 07:40.252
Listen, Beck.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.836
I've been thinking about

07:40.294 --> 07:41.836
this extra cheese thing.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.463
I think it's a rip-off

07:41.878 --> 07:43.463
because how do you really know

07:43.504 --> 07:46.216
if you're getting extra cheese

07:43.504 --> 07:46.216
or not? You don't.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.551
I was talking

07:46.258 --> 07:48.551
about the baby's<i> hat.</i>

07:48.593 --> 07:49.928
The one I asked you to put on

07:49.970 --> 07:52.139
if you took the baby

07:49.970 --> 07:52.139
out into the cold air?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.765
Oh yeah, I know the hat.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.765
I put it on.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.017
It just, uh, must've fallen off

07:53.807 --> 07:56.017
on my way out, that's all.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.477
- Really?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.477
- Hm.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.604
And landed behind

07:57.518 --> 07:59.604
this pillow?

07:59.646 --> 08:01.148
[laughs]

08:01.189 --> 08:03.775
What are the odds of that,

08:01.189 --> 08:03.775
a million to one, say?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.986
- Probably.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.986
- Yeah.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.197
Aw, just look at this.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.197
His head is freezing.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.616
You know, my mother says that

08:09.239 --> 08:11.616
sixty percent of the body's heat

08:11.658 --> 08:12.951
is lost through the head.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.204
Sixty percent

08:12.993 --> 08:16.204
of his body<i> is</i> his head.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.831
That's why he should

08:16.246 --> 08:17.831
be wearing a hat!

08:17.872 --> 08:19.540
He's gonna get sick.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.337
Becky, he can't wear

08:21.709 --> 08:23.337
the hat in the house.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.213
It'll stunt his hair growth.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.381
What hair?

08:26.423 --> 08:27.882
The hair I'm tryin' to grow

08:27.924 --> 08:29.092
if we can get some sunlight

08:29.134 --> 08:31.886
and fresh air

08:29.134 --> 08:31.886
on his bald little head.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.055
You know what,

08:31.928 --> 08:34.055
if you don't believe me

08:34.097 --> 08:36.433
maybe you'll believe my mother.

08:36.475 --> 08:40.437
She always said, "A hat on the

08:36.475 --> 08:40.437
head keeps a child out of bed."

08:40.479 --> 08:42.189
Alright, well, I'll call

08:40.479 --> 08:42.189
my mom on the other line.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.940
She's got a few

08:42.230 --> 08:43.940
sayings of her own.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.485
My favorite is,

08:43.982 --> 08:46.485
"My boy is always right."

08:47.277 --> 08:49.404
Ha! Oh, hi, mom.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.365
Yeah, mom, listen.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.365
Could you talk to Jesse?

08:51.406 --> 08:54.242
He has a very cavalier

08:51.406 --> 08:54.242
attitude with the babies.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.162
Hi, ma. Becky is<i> really</i>

08:54.284 --> 08:57.162
overprotective of these kids.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.913

08:58.955 --> 09:01.124
(both)

08:58.955 --> 09:01.124
She wants to talk to you.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.084
- I don't wanna talk to her.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.084
- Talk to her.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.127
Be nice to my mom.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.127
Right now!

09:04.169 --> 09:05.337
- No, you--

09:04.169 --> 09:05.337
- Yes!

09:05.379 --> 09:07.422
- Hi, Nedra.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.422
- Hi, Irene.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.631
- How are you?

09:07.464 --> 09:08.631
- Hello.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.133
- Yeah. Fine.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.133
- Mm-hmm.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.676
- Right. Yeah, well.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.676
- Listen.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.178

09:11.718 --> 09:13.178
- My mom said that--

09:17.224 --> 09:19.434
"A hat on the head

09:17.224 --> 09:19.434

Uh-huh.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.020
Really?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.524
You stitched it on a sampler?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.524
Right. I got it.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.026
"A scarf on the throat

09:25.565 --> 09:28.026
goes great with a coat."

09:28.068 --> 09:30.404
Right.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.404
Mm-hmm.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.239
Uh-huh. Oh, yes.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.239
I'm writing these down. Yeah.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.367
- Oh, yeah. Got 'em.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.367
- O-okay. Hold on.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.743
Your mom wants

09:35.409 --> 09:36.743
to talk to my mom.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.870
Good. Because your mom

09:36.784 --> 09:38.870
wants to talk to my mom.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.429
Hi, Becky's mom.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.306
No. Oh, no, no. I didn't say,

09:55.470 --> 09:58.306
"squawk like a chicken."

09:58.348 --> 09:59.640
No, no, no. I said..

10:14.531 --> 10:16.450
You can't go charging

10:16.491 --> 10:18.659

- See, Beck, there you go again.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.425
Y-you're treating 'em

10:31.631 --> 10:33.425

Jess, he doesn't

10:36.344 --> 10:38.930

10:38.972 --> 10:40.723
Babies need to feel secure.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.100
Their personalities are affected

10:42.142 --> 10:43.851
by every decision that we make.

10:43.893 --> 10:44.978
That why we got to be cool

10:45.019 --> 10:46.813
so they'll grow up to be cool.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.441
Beck, these kids

10:46.854 --> 10:49.441
were born to be wild.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.068
Excuse me, they were born

10:49.483 --> 10:52.068
to be little gentlemen.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.862
That'll make a fine tattoo.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.824
Beck, you're turning

10:54.904 --> 10:57.824
our kids into wimps.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.742
Beck, I-I just think that

10:57.865 --> 10:59.742
from now on you ought to let me

10:59.784 --> 11:01.786
make the parenting

10:59.784 --> 11:01.786
decisions around here.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.204
Oh, well,

11:01.828 --> 11:03.204
that would be a good plan

11:03.246 --> 11:06.416
except every decision

11:03.246 --> 11:06.416
you make is wrong.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.876
The point is, I know more

11:06.458 --> 11:08.876
about raising kids than you do.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.378
- Ha!

11:08.918 --> 11:10.378
- Yeah.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.089
I bet if I raised Alex

11:10.420 --> 11:13.089

13:57.044 --> 14:00.548
Mommy, Nicholas

13:57.044 --> 14:00.548
just called me a dork.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.925
[sobbing]

14:02.967 --> 14:04.427
Oh, baby.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.427
Yes, baby.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.179
You see how you messed up Alex?

14:06.220 --> 14:08.889
Ha! Not as bad as you

14:06.220 --> 14:08.889
messed up Nicky!

14:08.931 --> 14:10.558
Well, at least he doesn't cry.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.311
He can't help it.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.311
He has a rash.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.398
He's got a rash,

14:14.771 --> 14:17.398
he-he should take it like a man.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.484
Now you see what'll happen

14:17.440 --> 14:19.484
if we baby these kids?

14:19.526 --> 14:22.945
Oh! My kid would never

14:19.526 --> 14:22.945
turn out to be such a wimp.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.614
But your kid,

14:22.987 --> 14:24.614
that was pretty scary.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.282
No, that would never happen.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.993
Are you saying that your kid

14:26.324 --> 14:28.993
<i>wouldn't</i> be out of control?

14:29.035 --> 14:31.287
No. I'm saying

14:29.035 --> 14:31.287
I'll never lose my hair.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.997
If I do, I'll get

14:31.329 --> 14:32.997
one of those rugs that stays

14:33.039 --> 14:35.291
on in the wind

14:33.039 --> 14:35.291
and in the pool and everything.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.086
Hey, Jess?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.798
Does this baby

14:39.128 --> 14:41.798
look a little flushed to you?

14:42.757 --> 14:44.592
Yeah, he does.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.637
He's warm, too.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.056
He sounds congested.

14:50.097 --> 14:53.059
Becky, what do we do? Our kids

14:50.097 --> 14:53.059
have never been sick before.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.143
Alright. Don't panic. Um..

14:54.185 --> 14:55.562
I-I'll take his temperature.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.855
Alright, I'll get

14:55.603 --> 14:56.855
the humidifier.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.356
- I'll call the doctor.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.356
- Yeah.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.774
You know, I'll-I'll take..

14:59.816 --> 15:02.360
...take him out

14:59.816 --> 15:02.360
just in case he's contagious.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.612
It's okay, sweetie.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.612
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.740
Mommy's going to take

15:04.654 --> 15:06.740
your temperature, okay?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.076
[instrumental music]

15:12.453 --> 15:15.998
What is taking

15:12.453 --> 15:15.998
my dinner so long?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.958
Are my friends looking at me?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.002
DJ, nobody is looking at you.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.714
[indistinct chatter]

15:22.756 --> 15:25.550
[sighs]

15:22.756 --> 15:25.550
Can I wait in the car?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
Honey, there is no fun

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
happening in the car.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.554
All the fun is right here.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.472
Ugh!

15:34.475 --> 15:36.394
Why did I order this?

15:37.478 --> 15:39.355
Here, Michelle.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.943
Ew, gross!

15:40.940 --> 15:43.943
Kill it, daddy!

15:43.984 --> 15:45.779
Michelle, it's just an octopus

15:45.820 --> 15:47.530
and it's already dead.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.078
Excuse me, sir, could you, uh

15:54.120 --> 15:56.122
put our little

15:54.120 --> 15:56.122
eight-legged cephalopod

15:56.163 --> 15:58.082
back in the tank, please?

15:59.375 --> 16:02.169
Are you<i> sure</i>

15:59.375 --> 16:02.169
it's not my birthday?

16:02.211 --> 16:03.880
Yes, sweetheart,

16:02.211 --> 16:03.880
for the hundredth time

16:03.922 --> 16:05.590
it's<i> that</i> little girl's

16:03.922 --> 16:05.590
birthday.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.426
And that's why<i> she</i> gets

16:05.632 --> 16:08.426
the chocolate cake, alright?

16:08.468 --> 16:11.679
Is she going to eat

16:08.468 --> 16:11.679
the<i> whole</i> thing?

16:11.721 --> 16:14.641
Michelle, just suck it up

16:11.721 --> 16:14.641
and move on.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.477
Ahoy!

16:17.518 --> 16:21.314
Knackwurst and potato

16:17.518 --> 16:21.314
pancakes for the landlubber.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.150
Well, it's about time.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.152
Hey! I know you!

16:26.193 --> 16:28.279
You're Ranger Joe from TV!

16:28.321 --> 16:30.573
Hey, kids, look who's here!

16:28.321 --> 16:30.573
It's Ranger Joe!

16:30.615 --> 16:32.074
- Ranger Joe!

16:30.615 --> 16:32.074
- Look at this.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.993
- There you go.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.993
- Kids.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.578
I-I'd like to sign your

16:34.034 --> 16:35.578
autographs, but could you wait

16:35.620 --> 16:37.079
till<i> after</i> I finished my dinner?

16:37.121 --> 16:39.206
[sneezes]

16:40.500 --> 16:42.335
I'm finished. Okay.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.628
Where's that pen?

16:43.670 --> 16:47.089
- Hi, DJ!

16:43.670 --> 16:47.089
- Oh, hi, Shelly.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.424
What are you guys doing here?

16:48.466 --> 16:50.176
We thought it'd be

16:48.466 --> 16:50.176
a riot to come goof

16:50.217 --> 16:52.720
on all the lame

16:50.217 --> 16:52.720
families that come here.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.138
[chuckling]

16:54.180 --> 16:55.974
That's why we're here too.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.226
Uh-uh. It's Tanner Family

16:56.015 --> 16:59.226
Fun Night.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.647
I got to tell

17:00.478 --> 17:02.647
the guys this one.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.150
I've got to find a new school.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.111
Ew!

17:09.153 --> 17:12.114
This one has eyes!

17:12.156 --> 17:15.117
I'm sorry, but I can't eat

17:12.156 --> 17:15.117
anything that's looking at me.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.078
Sweetheart, you can't let

17:16.536 --> 17:18.078
all this food go to waste.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.413
Joey, you want to eat it?

17:19.455 --> 17:21.624
Danny, that's not dinner.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.624
It's marineland.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.378
A whole semester

17:23.417 --> 17:25.378
trying to be cool

17:25.419 --> 17:28.923
wiped out by<i> one</i> night

17:25.419 --> 17:28.923
of Tanner Family Fun.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.217
Okay, that's it.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.217
We're out of here.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.761
- Check, please!

17:31.258 --> 17:33.761
- Not so fast, matey!

17:33.803 --> 17:37.139
I spy a landlubber who hasn't

17:33.803 --> 17:37.139
finished his Sunken Treasure.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.266
And that means

17:37.181 --> 17:39.266
you walk the plank!

17:39.308 --> 17:42.353
[all chanting]

17:39.308 --> 17:42.353
Plank! Plank! Plank!

17:42.395 --> 17:44.647
[bell ringing]

17:44.689 --> 17:46.190
Plank! Plank!

17:46.232 --> 17:47.400
- Enough!

17:46.232 --> 17:47.400
- Plank, plank!

17:47.441 --> 17:49.193
Harr!

17:49.235 --> 17:50.611
That's your favorite letter,

17:49.235 --> 17:50.611
isn't it?

17:50.653 --> 17:53.364
Any last words?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.909
Yes. There's something

17:53.406 --> 17:55.909
I'd like to say to my family.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.955
Tonight...I had a dream..

18:00.997 --> 18:04.000
...that people who love each

18:00.997 --> 18:04.000
other could go out together..

18:04.042 --> 18:07.837
..to laugh, have fun..

18:07.879 --> 18:09.756
...to eat fish.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.884
But who was I kidding?

18:12.926 --> 18:13.968
Only myself.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.386
Okay, I'm ready now.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.514
[all chanting]

18:15.428 --> 18:18.514
Plank! Plank! Plank!

18:18.556 --> 18:20.808
- 'Wait!'

18:18.556 --> 18:20.808
- Plank!

18:20.850 --> 18:22.268
[sighs]

18:20.850 --> 18:22.268
This is my fault.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.603
I'm the one who ordered

18:23.644 --> 18:27.565
"The Undersea World

18:23.644 --> 18:27.565
Of Jacques Cousteau."

18:27.607 --> 18:30.317
And if<i> anyone</i> deserves

18:27.607 --> 18:30.317
to walk the plank, it's<i> me!</i>

18:30.359 --> 18:32.737
[all chanting]

18:30.359 --> 18:32.737
Plank! Plank! Plank!

18:33.487 --> 18:35.782
Hold on.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.242
I should be the one

18:35.823 --> 18:38.242
who has to walk the plank.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.493
The reason we didn't

18:38.284 --> 18:39.493
have fun tonight

18:39.535 --> 18:41.662
was because of<i> my</i> bad attitude.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.790
So someone sneezed

18:41.704 --> 18:43.790
on my knackwurst.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.332
Big deal.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.001
Dad, Joey's right.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.587
We all had bad attitudes.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.714
I admit, when I first came here

18:51.756 --> 18:53.549
I was a little embarrassed.

18:53.591 --> 18:57.053
But now that I'm up here

18:53.591 --> 18:57.053
standing on a boat..

18:57.095 --> 18:59.055
...and seeing

18:57.095 --> 18:59.055
everybody stare at me

18:59.097 --> 19:01.015
I'm totally humiliated.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.851
My turn!

19:03.893 --> 19:06.562
Sarah, are you going

19:03.893 --> 19:06.562
to eat<i> all</i> that cake?

19:10.190 --> 19:11.734
Oh, you know..

19:11.776 --> 19:14.070
...this was really sweet

19:11.776 --> 19:14.070
of you guys to come up here.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.280
This was kind of the Tanner

19:14.112 --> 19:16.280
Family Fun I was hoping for.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.865
[all chanting]

19:16.322 --> 19:17.865
Plank! Plank! Plank!

19:17.907 --> 19:20.326
Okay, okay,

19:17.907 --> 19:20.326
I'll walk the plank.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.620
But not because

19:20.367 --> 19:22.620
I didn't clean my plate.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.581
Because I came here

19:22.662 --> 19:25.581
for Tanner Family Fun Night

19:25.623 --> 19:27.541
and gosh, darn it, we Tanners

19:25.623 --> 19:27.541
are gonna have some fun!

19:27.583 --> 19:29.376
- Am I right, me buckos?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.376
- Harr!

19:29.418 --> 19:30.503
Yeah!

19:30.544 --> 19:32.212
Okay.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.090
Man overboard! Ho!

19:34.132 --> 19:36.216
[thud]

19:36.258 --> 19:38.719
Well, blow me down! Whoa!

19:38.761 --> 19:40.138
[thud]

19:40.179 --> 19:42.306
Cannonball!

19:43.265 --> 19:44.934
Cowabunga!

19:44.976 --> 19:46.477
[thud]

19:46.519 --> 19:47.770
I'll go wait in the car.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.730
Harr!

19:49.772 --> 19:51.691
What the heck!

19:51.732 --> 19:53.693
- Hey, hey.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.693
- Thank you.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.320
[all squealing]

19:58.405 --> 19:59.448
Look out!

19:59.490 --> 20:01.283
Help me!

20:01.325 --> 20:03.911
[indistinct chatter]

20:08.374 --> 20:10.459
It's okay, honey.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.459
You're gonna be alright.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.419
Jess, when is the doctor

20:10.501 --> 20:12.419
gonna call?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.629
It's been over an hour.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.297
[sighs]

20:13.671 --> 20:15.297
I don't know.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.509
Becky, I'm sorry. This-this

20:15.339 --> 20:18.509
whole thing's my fault.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.511
- Jess, it's not your fault.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.511
- Oh, yes it is.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.680
I should've listened to you

20:20.553 --> 20:22.680
in the first place. I mean..

20:22.722 --> 20:25.099
You know, I took-I took Alex

20:22.722 --> 20:25.099
out without a hat to get pizza

20:25.141 --> 20:27.267
and now he's got a fever.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.267
I'm sorry.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.396
Honey, it was Nicky

20:27.309 --> 20:30.396
you took out without a hat.

20:31.522 --> 20:32.815
It was?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.778
Becky, I-I don't know

20:34.567 --> 20:37.778
what I'm doing here anymore.

20:37.820 --> 20:38.863
I know what you mean.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.198
I feel like

20:38.905 --> 20:40.198
these kids should come

20:40.239 --> 20:41.615
with an owner's manual.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.159
[telephone ringing]

20:44.785 --> 20:46.495
Hello? Yes, Dr. Arnold.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.039
Okay. Thanks for calling back.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.290
Listen, Alex has

20:48.081 --> 20:50.290
a-a temperature of 101.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.545
Yeah, yeah, we did the compress.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.630
Right, we did the humidifier.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.841
I took the other baby out.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.841
Yeah, right.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.219
We did it.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.970
Did it.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.472
That's it? What am I

21:03.012 --> 21:05.472
paying you for?

21:06.432 --> 21:07.641
Just kidding.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.018
Alright. Thanks, doc.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.394
Bye.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.188
What did he say?

21:12.230 --> 21:13.397
He said we're doing

21:12.230 --> 21:13.397
everything right

21:13.439 --> 21:15.524
and there's nothing else to do.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.152
Hey, Jess?

21:18.194 --> 21:19.486
Look at this.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.322
[sighs]

21:19.528 --> 21:22.322
Alex's temperature

21:19.528 --> 21:22.322
is back to normal.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.117
That's it? We did it? We got him

21:22.364 --> 21:24.117
through his first fever?

21:24.158 --> 21:25.701
Yes and we didn't even

21:24.158 --> 21:25.701
argue about it.

21:25.743 --> 21:26.786
Or even call our moms.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.913
[laughing]

21:30.998 --> 21:32.499
Beck, I'm sorry, I..

21:32.541 --> 21:34.752
...I've been a real pain.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.503
I'm sorry, too.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.883
Honey, we both want

21:38.131 --> 21:40.883
what's best for our kids

21:40.925 --> 21:43.677
and we just disagree sometimes

21:40.925 --> 21:43.677
on how to get there.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.722
Yeah, about this parenting

21:43.719 --> 21:46.722
thing, I mean..

21:46.764 --> 21:48.099
...these kids are gonna be

21:46.764 --> 21:48.099
hanging around the house

21:48.141 --> 21:49.934
for a good 18 to 19 more years.

21:49.976 --> 21:50.977
[laughs]

21:51.018 --> 21:52.270
We better come up with a plan.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.521
Okay, I think, instead

21:52.311 --> 21:54.521
of arguing so much

21:54.563 --> 21:56.565
we should really

21:54.563 --> 21:56.565
listen to each other.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.234
And then we can take

21:56.607 --> 21:58.234
the best of what each of us

21:58.276 --> 22:00.069
has to say and compromise.

22:00.111 --> 22:01.361
That's a good plan.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.156
- Well, we make a great team.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.156
- Mm-hmm.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.909
Actually, I, uh,

22:04.240 --> 22:06.909
smell an opportunity

22:06.951 --> 22:09.078
for teamwork as we speak.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.747
Okay, so what do

22:09.120 --> 22:11.747
we use, partner?

22:11.789 --> 22:13.207
Cornstarch or baby powder?

22:13.249 --> 22:16.836
Well, I say, we go

22:13.249 --> 22:16.836
for a little combo platter.

22:16.877 --> 22:20.840
Alright. We'll make a very

22:16.877 --> 22:20.840
special baby butt blend.

22:20.881 --> 22:24.426
Here we go.

22:20.881 --> 22:24.426
I'll mix and you apply.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.179
- Ah, what a team!

22:24.468 --> 22:26.179
- Yeah!

22:26.220 --> 22:28.430
Alright. We're ready.

22:26.220 --> 22:28.430
Let's take 'em off.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.641
- Wh-whoa!

22:28.472 --> 22:30.641
- Ohh! Whoo!

22:33.936 --> 22:36.897
♪ Aah aah aah aah ♪♪

22:49.327 --> 22:52.412
[music continues]
