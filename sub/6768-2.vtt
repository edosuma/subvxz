WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:07.424
(panicked, overlapping chatter)

00:07.507 --> 00:09.592
{\an1}Brandon, talk to me.
It's okay, baby.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.635
We're at the hospital now.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.761
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.221
You're gonna be okay.

00:13.304 --> 00:14.764
{\an6}Tell me what
you've got.
Gunshot to the abdomen.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.599
Blood pressure's 80 over palp.
Pulse is 120.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.101
She's in shock.
Let's get her to Trauma One.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.936
Do you have allergies?
No, she doesn't.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.271
{\an5}Are you taking any
medications?
No, she isn't.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.397
{\an1}You have to let us
work here.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.314
{\an5}Do you have any past
medical problems?
Please!

00:23.398 --> 00:25.275
{\an3}Brandon, don't leave me.
I want a pulse ox

00:25.358 --> 00:26.317
and a monitor.
Brandon! Brandon!

00:26.401 --> 00:27.569
{\an1}W need a second IV,
a hematocrit

00:27.652 --> 00:28.611
and get her blood typed
and crossed.

00:28.695 --> 00:29.446
{\an1}NURSE:
Cardiologist.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.488
{\an3}On three.
Ready.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.573
One, two, three.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.951
{\an1}Hey, is she gonna
be okay?

00:35.034 --> 00:37.287
{\an3}I-I told them that she
doesn't have any allergies.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.372
That's right, isn't it?
I...

00:42.709 --> 00:43.752
Oh, my God.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.629
Pulse ox is 88% and corrolating.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.714
Spun crit is 30.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.215
{\an1}Let's hang two units
O negative.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.383
{\an1}Call the OR.
Tell them we're coming up

00:50.467 --> 00:51.801
for an exploratory laparotomy,

00:51.885 --> 00:54.679
and I want an orthopedist
standing by. Let's go!

00:57.348 --> 00:58.725
How is she?

00:58.808 --> 00:59.809
{\an3}She's in very
serious condition.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.436
She's gonna be okay,
isn't she?

01:01.519 --> 01:02.479
A surgeon has been called in,

01:02.562 --> 01:03.688
and as soon as he's finished,

01:03.772 --> 01:05.815
{\an3}I'm sure he'll come
and talk to you.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.818
Excuse me,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.445
I'm Detective
Woods, LAPD.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.489
{\an3}I'd like to ask you all
a few questions.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.448
We're a little preoccupied
right now.

01:13.531 --> 01:14.491
Can we deal with this later?

01:14.574 --> 01:15.325
No, we can't.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.160
Not if you want
to catch the chump

01:17.243 --> 01:18.661
who did this.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.121
Come on.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.123
I'll expense the coffee.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.503
{\an3}MAN:
Code D in four.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.546
DONNA:
<i>She would never hurt anyone.</i>

01:28.630 --> 01:31.090
She's the kindest person
that I know.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.967
You said you got a good look
at the car, right?

01:33.051 --> 01:35.970
We'd just gotten back
from Hawaii.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.514
We celebrated her birthday
there.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.307
{\an3}You'd said it was
a two-door.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.142
Four-door.
Definitely a four-door.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.560
Can you describe the passengers?

01:42.644 --> 01:43.645
{\an1}STEVE:
Three white kids.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.480
Uh, two with black hair.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.648
One blond.

01:46.731 --> 01:47.690
{\an3}Their age?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.317
Mid-20s.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.527
There were two of them.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.321
{\an1}They were tall
and thin.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.156
Hispanic, maybe.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.200
{\an3}And how many shots
were fired?

01:57.283 --> 01:58.243
Two.
One.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.370
Well, actually
the truth is,

02:00.453 --> 02:03.039
{\an3}after the first shot, I really
don't remember too much.

02:03.122 --> 02:05.041
WOODS:
And the shooter?

02:05.124 --> 02:06.835
Short and stocky.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.752
{\an1}NOAH:
A teenager, I'd say.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.380
18, probably.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.006
19 tops.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.384
Did you get any kind
of look at his face?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.010
Dark eyes. Almost black.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.053
Narrow, crooked nose.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.055
Thin lips, small teeth.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.348
{\an3}Hispanic?

02:20.431 --> 02:22.058
No, white.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.852
Early 20s.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.521
Wearing jeans and
a dirty blue T-shirt.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.439
Five-nine, probably 160.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.442
{\an3}You know it was pretty
dark out there.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.944
{\an3}You sure of your
description?

02:33.027 --> 02:34.237
Absolutely.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.239
Anything else?

02:36.322 --> 02:37.907
{\an1}Yeah.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.909
You put him in front of me,

02:39.993 --> 02:43.037
I'll kill him.

Where's my baby?

04:51.124 --> 04:53.167
she's still in surgery.
How could this happen?

04:53.251 --> 04:55.294
Could somebody please tell me
how this could happen?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.047
{\an3}You're here with
Miss Taylor?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.007
Yes, I'm her mother.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.216
How is she?

05:00.299 --> 05:01.884
The operation went well.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.845
Bullet fragments punctured
your daughter's

05:03.928 --> 05:05.388
small intestine
in two places.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.889
I cut out the damaged sections

05:06.973 --> 05:08.933
and stitched together
the injury free portions.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.935
So she's okay?

05:11.019 --> 05:13.062
A bullet fragment also lodged
in Kelly's thigh,

05:13.146 --> 05:14.105
severing an artery.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.024
That was also reattached.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.525
What's the bottom line, Doc?

05:17.608 --> 05:19.027
She should be fine.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.029
Great.

05:21.112 --> 05:21.946
When can we see her?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.032
{\an3}She's sedated and should
sleep until morning.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.742
You've all had a long night.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.410
{\an1}I suggest you go home
and get some rest.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.078
You can see her tomorrow.
There's some paperwork

05:29.162 --> 05:31.080
{\an3}for you to fill out.
I'll walk you over

05:31.164 --> 05:32.081
{\an3}to Admitting.
Okay.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.083
Come on, man,

05:34.167 --> 05:35.960
{\an5}I'll give you a ride.
Ah, that's
all right,

05:36.044 --> 05:37.336
I think I'm gonna stay here.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.880
No, come on.
Doctor's orders.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.131
Maybe we should all stay.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.424
No, no, you guys go ahead.
I'll be fine.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.258
{\an3}Sure?

05:42.341 --> 05:43.384
Yeah, yeah, positive.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.136
Bran, will you call us
with any news?

05:45.219 --> 05:46.054
I sure will.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.305
All right, man.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.765
See you, guys.
Bye.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.224
{\an3}Can you give me a
lift to the marina?

05:50.308 --> 05:51.517
Yeah, definitely.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.911
{\an3}NAT:
Hey.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.621
Kid's got colic,
wife's got the flu,

06:11.704 --> 06:14.499
and I got a waitress that quits
the week before school starts.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.501
{\an3}Thank God it's almost
closing time.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.877
You haven't heard?

06:17.960 --> 06:20.088
{\an3}What, about your Hawaiian
visit? Happily, no.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.841
{\an3}A news report from paradise
I don't need right now.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.095
{\an1}Oh, man, am I psyched
to see you.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.138
And you would be?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.099
{\an1}Jack Hooper,
KEG rush chairman,

06:31.182 --> 06:33.768
feebly following your
gargantuan footsteps.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.812
Yeah, look, now's not a good
time all right, man?

06:35.895 --> 06:36.896
Check it out, see,

06:36.979 --> 06:39.315
{\an1}me and the guys got a couple
pledges over there, right?

06:40.399 --> 06:42.151
Not now. I'm sorry.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.028
{\an1}Come on, man, just give me
two minutes, all right?

06:44.112 --> 06:46.114
{\an1}They're leaning
toward to Sigma Chi.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.365
I said no.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.825
{\an4}JACK:
Yeah, well, thanks
for nothing.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.828
Some alumni rep you are.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.414
So, uh, what didn't I hear?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.125
Kelly was shot.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.001
What? Is she all right?

06:59.085 --> 07:00.294
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.089
I just stopped by to the Peach
Pit After Dark, but it's locked.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.007
{\an1}I wanted to get a drink.
Do you have the keys?

07:05.091 --> 07:05.842
Yeah. Wh-What happened?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.176
I mean did they get
the son of a...

07:07.260 --> 07:08.845
Just-- can I have the keys?

07:09.887 --> 07:10.930
(key jangling)

07:11.013 --> 07:13.224
{\an3}Sure. Side door.
Thanks.

07:15.434 --> 07:17.311
All right, my man,

07:17.395 --> 07:19.313
{\an1}I knew you wouldn't
leave me hanging like that.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.983
You know Moe, Larry
and Curly, right?

07:22.066 --> 07:25.319
And this is Charlotte Campbell.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.280
{\an1}C.U.'s answer
to Michael Jordan.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.574
Right, so, these

07:29.657 --> 07:32.160
{\an1}are the lowly worms who need
to know how joining KEG

07:32.243 --> 07:34.162
{\an3}is gonna change
their lives.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.205
{\an1}KEG's not gonna
change your lives

07:36.289 --> 07:37.999
one bit, boys.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.167
Nice.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.210
Real inspirational.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.213
But if you care
to taste a drink

07:44.297 --> 07:45.715
{\an1}that's gonna make
your eyes burn,

07:45.798 --> 07:48.009
your tongue hang out
and your memory fade,

07:48.092 --> 07:49.051
then follow me.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.387
{\an1}Otherwise,
have a nice life.

08:07.778 --> 08:08.738
{\an3}What?

08:08.821 --> 08:10.823
What's wrong?

08:11.824 --> 08:13.743
{\an1}Nothing.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.578
{\an1}(sighs)

08:15.661 --> 08:17.580
I guess, um, part of me

08:17.663 --> 08:19.165
{\an1}just expects
to open the door,

08:19.248 --> 08:22.251
{\an1}find Kelly standing there
on the other side.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.050
{\an3}Come here.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.191
Life is so fragile.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.495
It's things like this
that make you realize

08:57.578 --> 09:00.414
{\an1}how much we take
for granted, you know.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.627
Yeah.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.427
{\an3}So, I noticed that you left
your suitcase in the car.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.433
{\an1}Donna, we discussed
this already.

09:21.018 --> 09:24.021
{\an3}And I promised to tell
my parents about us.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.024
I will.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.654
{\an1}Well, I'm not moving in
until you do.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.331
(car engine roaring)

09:44.083 --> 09:46.085
NOAH:
<i>We're here. Pull over.</i>

09:50.089 --> 09:52.174
Well, I thought you wanted
to look out over the city.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.467
I do.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.719
Well, the turnout's up there.

09:54.802 --> 09:58.723
{\an1}Uh, the house we're going in
is right there.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.101
Nice.

10:02.184 --> 10:05.021
Of course, I prefer New England
Colonial style myself.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.481
You know, white with black
shutters, snow falling.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.401
Your basic currier and ives.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.486
So, whose house is this anyways?

10:12.570 --> 10:14.572
I have no idea.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.035
Okay.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.044
{\an1}All right, come on,
we're gonna get caught.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.712
Maybe.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.554
Okay, you've had your fun.

10:38.637 --> 10:41.432
{\an1}Look, we're gonna get arrested
for trespassing.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.730
It seems peaceful, doesn't it?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.231
(distant car horns honking)

10:49.315 --> 10:52.568
You know, you read
about people getting shot,

10:52.651 --> 10:55.112
but you never think it's gonna
be somebody you know.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.365
The City of Angels.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.200
What a joke, huh?

11:00.826 --> 11:02.119
Are you one?

11:02.203 --> 11:04.246
Hardly.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.582
That's good.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.613
{\an3}So why are we
doing this?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.241
{\an1}Because we're
not supposed to.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.302
(heart monitor beeping)

12:03.180 --> 12:06.183
I talked to the detective
about what happened.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.979
He said you tried
to protect her.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.272
(sighs)
I mean, I...

12:11.355 --> 12:13.023
I confronted them,

12:13.107 --> 12:15.276
one of them, and...

12:15.359 --> 12:17.319
and then they drove away.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.364
{\an3}I mean, I heard
the car drive away,

12:20.448 --> 12:22.992
and then I heard it turn around

12:23.075 --> 12:25.995
and then all of a sudden,

12:26.078 --> 12:27.997
the window came down

12:28.080 --> 12:31.208
and he started firing.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.919
{\an3}He didn't even
slow down.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.006
Have you told Erin yet?

12:37.089 --> 12:40.217
How do you explain something
like this to a six-year-old?

12:43.929 --> 12:46.599
Mel's waiting for my call.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.275
Did you hear the good news?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.945
You're gonna be okay.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.908
(sighs)

13:05.284 --> 13:07.286
Kel, I am so sorry.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.168
If I hadn't been so stupid

13:14.251 --> 13:17.838
and stood up to those guys...

13:20.299 --> 13:22.301
...none of this would
be happening right now.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.341
(heart monitor beeping)

14:15.854 --> 14:17.273
Hi.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.233
Hi.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.239
How are you feeling?

14:25.322 --> 14:26.615
Mm...

14:26.699 --> 14:28.617
I don't know yet.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.245
Am I gonna be all right?

14:31.328 --> 14:34.331
{\an3}The doctor expects
a complete recovery.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.626
{\an3}I guess we should
tell the nurses

14:37.710 --> 14:39.211
{\an3}they have a patient
to take care of.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.796
No.

14:40.879 --> 14:43.173
No, not yet.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.302
{\an1}I just want
to be alone with you.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.019
{\an5}DAVID:
<i>You'll tell Kelly</i>
<i>why I can't come by, right?</i>

14:55.102 --> 14:57.313
{\an1}Yeah, as soon as I get
to the hospital.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.316
She probably shouldn't
have too many visitors

15:00.399 --> 15:01.859
this morning anyway.

15:02.901 --> 15:05.154
David, she's gonna understand.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.655
{\an1}The After Dark's
reopening tonight.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.198
You have to get things
taken care of.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.325
(sighs)

15:09.408 --> 15:11.160
(knocking on door)

15:11.243 --> 15:13.454
{\an3}I'm gonna stop by
this afternoon.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.496
Well, just take your time.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.497
Tonight's a big night.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.665
You want it to be a success.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.000
(insistent knocking)

15:18.083 --> 15:19.293
Who is that?

15:28.927 --> 15:30.846
Oh...
Mom!

15:30.929 --> 15:32.640
What a surprise.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.849
Jackie called me.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.017
Are you all right?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.185
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.020
{\an3}Well, I mean fine,
considering

15:38.103 --> 15:40.022
what happened.
It must have been awful.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.398
{\an1}It was.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.486
I mean, awful.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.488
Poor thing.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.490
I wish you'd come to the house
last night.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.034
To think of you here all by
yourself after what happened--

15:52.117 --> 15:53.535
I just can't imagine.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.870
I'm sure you can't.

15:54.953 --> 15:59.124
{\an1}Mom, can you excuse me
for a second?

16:09.593 --> 16:10.844
Okay, my mom's here.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.429
Oh, really?

16:12.513 --> 16:13.764
Tell her I'll be right out.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.182
Well, that's not funny.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.101
Donna, relax.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.520
Come on, what's the worst thing
that could happen?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.021
Oh, uh, I could burn in hell.

16:21.105 --> 16:25.526
{\an3}Okay, what's the second worse
thing that could happen?

16:25.609 --> 16:27.903
Donna, I thought you said you
were gonna come clean today.

16:27.986 --> 16:28.904
Yeah, I did, and I will,

16:28.987 --> 16:30.906
but not with you hiding here
in my bedroom.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.533
So will you please just go hide
in my closet?

16:32.616 --> 16:34.076
I don't want to
hide anywhere.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.244
{\an1}Please!

16:35.327 --> 16:37.079
{\an3}No, not unless you
promise to tell her.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.414
Sweetheart?

16:38.497 --> 16:39.081
(gasps)

16:40.999 --> 16:42.543
Donna, I know you're upset,

16:42.626 --> 16:45.129
{\an1}but, honey, you don't have
to hide it from me.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.797
Huh? What? Oh, no.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.757
{\an3}I'm, I'm not hiding
anything. I...

16:48.841 --> 16:51.343
{\an3}was just grabbing
some clothes.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.263
(sighs)

16:55.472 --> 16:57.099
FELICE:
Donna, I know you.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.143
It feels like you're holding
something back.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.772
You're right.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.065
Um... I am.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.359
And mom, it's, uh...

17:10.612 --> 17:12.614
{\an3}It's something
that's gonna upset you.

17:14.031 --> 17:15.325
I...

17:15.409 --> 17:17.536
{\an3}got fired from my job
in Hawaii.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.540
{\an1}(sighing):
Oh, honey.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.127
He was average.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.172
Five-nine, a hundred and fifty

17:28.255 --> 17:29.965
{\an1}pounds, a hundred
and fifty-five.

17:30.048 --> 17:36.013
He had, um... dark eyes
and this really...

17:36.096 --> 17:37.848
thin, evil smile.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.267
Brandon, we're putting together
a lineup.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.020
I want you to come down,
see if you can ID the guy.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.189
Yeah, sure, just give me
a minute here, will you?

17:45.272 --> 17:46.607
Yeah, I'll be outside.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.609
Oh, you know,

17:48.692 --> 17:50.652
I went to Intensive Care first.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.738
They told me that they had
to kick you out.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.991
I'm glad you're doing better.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.284
Thanks.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.663
Did good.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.165
You okay with this?

18:03.248 --> 18:04.333
I just couldn't face him.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.543
{\an3}I'm looking
forward to it.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.464
I'll see you later.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.509
JACKIE:
Before you guys go,

18:13.592 --> 18:15.177
would you mind getting
your blood typed?

18:15.260 --> 18:16.720
The head nurse says that
Kelly's AB negative

18:16.804 --> 18:18.013
which is very rare.

18:18.096 --> 18:20.849
And they don't have a supply,
so it there's an emergency...

18:20.933 --> 18:22.309
Yeah, no problem.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.895
Ah, still in bed?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.980
Gosh, you'd think you'd
been shot or something.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.899
Looks like you took a few
shots yourself, big man.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.859
Yeah, baker's dozen or so.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.860
Flaming, of course.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.237
And I am still standing.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.530
{\an3}Barely.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.325
FELICE:
Could you stand taking Erin

18:38.408 --> 18:40.327
to her soccer practice
this afternoon?

18:40.410 --> 18:42.371
She loved being with you
last week.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.414
20 screaming six-year-olds?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.668
Okay. Why not?

18:47.751 --> 18:51.004
{\an3}We were really worried
about you, Kelly.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.048
{\an5}DAVID:
<i>What do you mean the corporate</i>
<i>account's overdrawn?</i>

18:53.131 --> 18:55.217
I know I haven't made
any deposits lately

18:55.300 --> 18:56.927
but I haven't made
any withdrawals either.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.013
The club has been closed.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.390
Four kegs, three in the back,

19:01.473 --> 19:03.225
one under the bar
already tapped.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.854
Thanks.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.398
Okay, there's, there's
gotta be some mistake.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.735
I'm sorry, is there
something else?

19:13.819 --> 19:16.029
Boss says the delivery is COD.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.198
Let me call you back.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.951
16th street, Food
and Liquor, right?

19:21.034 --> 19:22.870
Last I checked.

19:22.953 --> 19:23.829
See, I don't understand.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.039
My account has never
been cash on delivery.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.041
Boss says you're late
on some payments.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.211
What is this, National Dump
On The Little Guy Day?

19:42.222 --> 19:46.226
You know, the least you could've
done was leave a note

19:46.310 --> 19:47.603
saying, "Had a great time.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.605
Will call."

19:49.688 --> 19:51.732
I had a great time.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.734
Toss me that sheet?

19:53.817 --> 19:54.818
Sheet?

19:54.902 --> 19:56.278
The line, the rope.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.613
{\an4}MAN:
Tie it up.
I'll be right over.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.947
{\an1}WOMAN:
All right!

19:59.031 --> 20:00.115
(over radio):
♪ 'Cause when the blues come

20:00.198 --> 20:02.117
♪ In the morning ♪

20:02.201 --> 20:05.787
♪ Oh, they hang around
all day... ♪

20:05.871 --> 20:07.789
You going somewhere?

20:07.873 --> 20:08.957
Going back to Hawaii
or something?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.001
Just a little toot
around the harbor.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.252
Want to come?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.630
You know, people say
I'm reckless,

20:14.713 --> 20:16.632
but you definitely
take the prize.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.133
That's why you should
stay away from me.

20:18.216 --> 20:20.093
So you're doing me a favor now?

20:20.177 --> 20:22.137
It's on the refrigerator door.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.013
What?

20:23.096 --> 20:24.431
The note I left you.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.516
Well, what'd it say?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.646
See ya.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.315
{\an3}Look, a terrible thing
happened last night.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.775
We were looking for comfort.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.610
And, uh, things went too far.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.154
You know, you can
be honest with me.

20:39.237 --> 20:40.280
Is there somebody else?

20:41.281 --> 20:43.241
I like you.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.202
I want you to come for a ride.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.162
No, thanks.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.081
You've already taken me for one.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.547
Come on.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.341
(groans)

20:59.424 --> 21:00.342
Ow!

21:00.425 --> 21:02.094
{\an3}If that little halfback
shoves him again,

21:02.177 --> 21:03.095
{\an3}I'm gonna take her
out myself.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.179
Go left! Go left!

21:04.262 --> 21:05.347
{\an3}No, go right!
Go right!

21:05.430 --> 21:08.392
Carly, why don't you
take it down a notch.

21:08.475 --> 21:12.104
{\an1}Keep the energy,
just quieter, please.

21:12.187 --> 21:16.817
{\an3}Like the fiery yet smooth
tequila you downed last night?

21:16.900 --> 21:19.194
{\an1}Do we know each other
this well?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.153
Sure.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.072
{\an3}I mean, after all,
you did get me fired.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.035
You smell nice.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.038
Yeah, well, you
look like hell.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.873
{\an1}I didn't get any sleep
last night.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.041
Oh, let me guess.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.168
Uh, legs up to here.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.337
Brainpower down to...
well, you know where.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.880
{\an3}You see her across
a crowded bar--

21:38.964 --> 21:39.798
{\an3}a sports bar,
of course--

21:39.881 --> 21:42.259
and she's standing
in front of the TV,

21:42.342 --> 21:45.053
{\an3}so you figure,
"Ha, what the heck?"

21:45.137 --> 21:47.055
{\an3}Two birds with
one drink, right?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.515
So you pull her aside,

21:48.598 --> 21:50.559
clearing the screen
for better viewing.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.061
{\an3}You pretend to listen
to her life story,

21:53.145 --> 21:55.063
{\an3}all the while keeping
your eye on...

21:55.147 --> 21:56.732
{\an3}the score.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.900
So, did you?

21:58.984 --> 22:00.777
You are so wrong.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.738
Uh-huh. What was her name?

22:02.821 --> 22:04.740
Kelly.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.575
Took you a little while
to get it, but you got it.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.784
That-that's pretty good.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.536
She's one of my oldest friends.

22:09.619 --> 22:10.829
Hmm.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.914
This random freak thing
happened.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.375
Couple of guys trying
to steal a car.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.336
She got shot.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.923
If this is a lie,
I'll rip you in half.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.258
I wish it were.

22:23.341 --> 22:25.927
{\an1}She just got out
of Intensive Care.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.095
I feel like an idiot.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.930
Why didn't you tell me before?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.265
I was trying to.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.435
But I wouldn't shut up.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.605
Look, about that job...

22:36.688 --> 22:39.274
I know a place
that's looking to hire.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.151
I think you'll really
like it there.

22:41.234 --> 22:44.571
That's really nice of you,
but you really don't have to.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.573
I want to.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.919
Hi.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.212
Hi.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.008
{\an3}I promised myself
I wasn't going to do this.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.760
(sniffles)

23:06.843 --> 23:08.637
{\an3}I, uh... I saw your mom
in the hallway.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.930
She said you're doing good.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.182
I am, silly,
so there's no reason to cry.

23:12.265 --> 23:13.350
Come in here.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.311
I'm just happy to see you.

23:16.394 --> 23:17.979
Me, too.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.481
Oh, my purse.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.149
Yeah, no one, uh...

23:21.233 --> 23:23.985
no one picked it up last night.

23:24.069 --> 23:27.489
So I grabbed it, and I
got your makeup case,

23:27.572 --> 23:29.491
{\an3}a few magazines
for you.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.201
News from the outside.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.744
(laughs)

23:32.828 --> 23:35.288
I'm so tired of talking
about myself.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.707
Sit down.
Tell me something about you.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.294
{\an3}Well, my mom completely
freaked out

23:41.378 --> 23:43.213
{\an3}when I told her
I got fired in Hawaii.

23:43.296 --> 23:45.173
No surprise.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.341
Go on.

23:46.424 --> 23:49.386
My dad immediately lined up
another interview for me.

23:49.469 --> 23:52.055
Some patient of his
that's a fashion designer.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.182
He calls her "real hip".

23:54.266 --> 23:55.142
No, he didn't.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.018
Oh, he's so cute.

23:57.102 --> 23:57.978
Oh, please.

23:58.061 --> 24:01.064
His idea of real hip
is designer sweat suits.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.900
And on the home front?

24:03.984 --> 24:05.694
I had a chance to tell my mom

24:05.777 --> 24:07.320
about David and me
moving in together,

24:07.404 --> 24:09.698
and I couldn't.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.200
You know what?

24:12.284 --> 24:15.328
This...

24:15.412 --> 24:18.832
is my key
to the beach apartment.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.876
I want you to give it
to David, okay?

24:20.959 --> 24:24.171
Well, David's not going to move
in until I talk to my parents.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.755
Then talk to them.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.051
Donna, last night,

24:30.135 --> 24:33.972
when we were walking to the car,
I told Brandon I loved him.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.100
{\an1}Then I got shot,
and all I

24:37.184 --> 24:40.520
could think about when I
was lying there in his arms

24:40.604 --> 24:43.899
was how happy I was
that I told him.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.902
{\an1}And I'm lying there
and I'm bleeding,

24:46.985 --> 24:49.404
and I think I'm dying,

24:49.487 --> 24:52.115
and even though he's heard me
say "I love you"

24:52.199 --> 24:55.202
probably a thousand times,

24:55.285 --> 24:57.913
all I can think

24:57.996 --> 25:00.916
is how happy I am
that I told him one more time.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.130
(sighs)

25:07.214 --> 25:09.758
We think we can wait on things.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.220
Even important things.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.224
We can't.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.117
{\an3}Number one,
step forward.

25:39.537 --> 25:41.498
DETECTIVE WOODS:
Turn to the side.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.585
That's him: number four.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.962
You sure?

25:47.045 --> 25:48.171
Positive.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.173
WOODS:
Put number four in lockup

25:50.257 --> 25:52.092
{\an3}and release
all the others.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.094
Thank you very much
for coming down.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.846
If we need anything else,
we'll be in touch.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.021
{\an1}WOODS: Brandon,
you did your job.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.148
Now let us do ours.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.660
KELLY:
<i>Okay.</i>

26:18.743 --> 26:20.120
I love you, too.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.788
Bye.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.999
Brandon made a positive
identification.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.042
{\an4}Oh, that's great.
They're charging
the guy

26:26.126 --> 26:27.711
with attempted murder.

26:27.794 --> 26:28.837
{\an3}DAVID:
Hi.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.130
Am I interrupting?

26:30.213 --> 26:31.965
Mmm. Thank God.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.133
Come in.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.468
Oh, they're beautiful.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.970
You... mm...

26:37.053 --> 26:38.221
are looking much better.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.848
{\an1}Thank you.

26:39.931 --> 26:40.849
Donna says you're very busy.

26:40.932 --> 26:41.850
Thanks for coming.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.018
{\an4}Ah.
FELICE:
Yes, it sounds

26:43.101 --> 26:44.811
like you have a lot going on.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.396
{\an4}Does it?
DONNA:
You know, at the club,

26:46.479 --> 26:48.189
with you reopening it
and everything.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.025
And that's all you told them?

26:51.067 --> 26:52.694
(laughing):
Is there more?

26:55.613 --> 26:57.032
No, I guess not.

26:57.115 --> 27:00.035
Well, I hear there's a sale
at Burnett's.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.037
Mm. Bye, Mom.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.039
(chuckles)
May I look in on you later?

27:04.122 --> 27:05.040
Yes.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.541
Okay.

27:06.624 --> 27:07.876
Good luck, David.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.252
Dr. Martin and I wish you

27:09.336 --> 27:11.171
{\an1}great success.
Thank you.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.172
Bye.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.506
Bye.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.052
{\an1}I thought you weren't
going to push.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.262
Well, excuse me. I'd like
to come out of the closet.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.932
Look, it's my mother.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.100
I'll tell her when I'm ready.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.894
{\an1}Uh, Donna, I...
No, you know what?

27:25.977 --> 27:28.104
I'm sorry.
We shouldn't be doing this here.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.107
You know where I stand.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.028
I have to get to my interview.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.071
Bye.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.280
{\an3}Bye.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.366
{\an3}Thanks.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.082
Nat Bussichio, this
is Carly Reynolds.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.792
{\an6}Oh, hi. Nice
to meet you.
Hi.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.585
{\an1}Steve tells me
you're looking for a job.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.212
{\an3}That's right. If
you need any ref...

27:52.295 --> 27:54.464
Can you start today?
That's it?

27:54.547 --> 27:55.715
{\an3}I'm hired?

27:55.799 --> 27:57.675
{\an1}Well, if he vouches
for you,

27:57.759 --> 27:58.718
{\an1}that's good enough
for me.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.471
{\an1}Listen, let me get through
this rush, and then, uh,

28:01.554 --> 28:03.056
{\an5}we'll come back
and talk, okay?
Great, yeah.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.265
{\an4}Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.434
Sure.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.062
Well, what can I say?

28:09.145 --> 28:11.064
How about yes?
To a date.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.941
Uh, Steve...

28:13.024 --> 28:14.609
Well, as a fallback...

28:14.692 --> 28:16.111
perhaps, ice cream!

28:16.194 --> 28:17.445
I want chocolate!
I want strawberry!

28:17.529 --> 28:19.614
{\an6}Ah.
You can have
ice cream

28:19.697 --> 28:21.199
as soon as you finish
your broccoli, okay?

28:21.282 --> 28:24.119
And here I thought you didn't
know how to celebrate.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.496
Ah... is that Brad Pitt?

28:30.375 --> 28:31.334
(laughing)

28:31.418 --> 28:33.294
Not even...

28:33.378 --> 28:34.796
close... ah.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.965
Very funny for a six-year-old.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.342
Well, I'm very young at heart.

28:39.426 --> 28:40.760
(laughing)

28:41.761 --> 28:42.929
You know, I have to say,

28:43.012 --> 28:44.305
I thought
I had you figured right off.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.141
Most people do; then they see

28:46.224 --> 28:49.144
that I'm a deep,
richly textured intellectual.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.520
(laughs)

28:50.603 --> 28:53.106
So, tell me,
when you're not getting people

28:53.189 --> 28:55.525
fired and hired,
what exactly do you do?

28:55.608 --> 28:57.485
Well, I just graduated from CU.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.404
Mm. Define "just."

29:00.405 --> 29:01.364
Three months ago.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.994
But, in that time,
I... I've gotten involved

29:06.077 --> 29:08.788
with some very interesting,
very cutting-edge things.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.790
Uh, I'm a, um...

29:10.874 --> 29:12.250
I'm, I'm, um...

29:14.085 --> 29:15.962
Uh, I'm a sports agent.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.839
And there's one of my clients
right now.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.132
Excuse me.

29:21.384 --> 29:23.219
So, how you feeling?

29:23.303 --> 29:25.680
{\an3}When I get feeling back,
I'll let you know.

29:25.763 --> 29:27.223
{\an1}Well, listen, there's
some big things going on

29:27.307 --> 29:29.017
at the Peach Pit After Dark
tonight.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.643
I can get you
on the guest list if you'd like.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.854
Promise a little
hair of the dog?

29:32.937 --> 29:34.481
Ah. Bullmastiff.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.191
You know, I was just thinking
you're a junior now,

29:36.274 --> 29:37.859
you're probably thinking
about the WNBA,

29:37.942 --> 29:38.985
the Olympics,
about representation.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.362
I've been thinking about
all that since junior high.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.990
Well, when it comes time
for you to look for an agent,

29:44.073 --> 29:45.158
keep me in mind, okay?

29:50.955 --> 29:52.999
Thanks.

29:53.082 --> 29:54.542
Miss Schulze?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.544
Do you have any idea
how busy I am?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.713
No, but I can come back.

29:58.796 --> 30:00.882
We did $75 million last year,
a hundred million

30:00.965 --> 30:03.718
this year and, according to this
projection, we're going to do

30:03.801 --> 30:05.762
$125 million next year.

30:05.845 --> 30:06.888
Towel.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.728
Did my assistant
show you our catalogue?

30:13.811 --> 30:15.021
Yes, while I
was waiting.

30:15.104 --> 30:17.065
{\an3}Everything
looks great.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.900
(scoffs)
Then you have terrible taste.

30:18.983 --> 30:19.984
Excuse me?

30:20.068 --> 30:21.945
Our clothes are hideous.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.405
They're boxy, bland-- boring!

30:24.489 --> 30:26.074
I, um, I-I thought

30:26.157 --> 30:27.033
you said you were doing well.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.118
Apparently, hideous is in.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.912
Oh.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.413
Come on, cut the bull.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.207
Tell me what you really think.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.085
Okay, well, um,

30:37.168 --> 30:39.879
the designs aren't, uh...

30:39.963 --> 30:42.465
you know, um,
exactly what I would do.

30:42.549 --> 30:45.260
In other words, you wouldn't
be caught dead wearing them.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.220
Well, I wouldn't take it
that far.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.721
I'd wear some of them.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.266
You know, around the house or...

30:51.349 --> 30:54.102
Well, not when I knew anyone
was coming over, but...

30:54.185 --> 30:58.106
Well... congratulations.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.819
{\an1}You're way too stylish
to work here.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.070
No, I'm not.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.405
Please, I can do boxy.

31:05.488 --> 31:06.614
I can do bland.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.782
I can do whatever you need.

31:07.865 --> 31:10.285
Of course you can,
but why would you?

31:10.368 --> 31:12.120
Because I need a job.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.372
Did I mention how busy I am?

31:15.540 --> 31:17.083
Did I tell you
that making clothes

31:17.166 --> 31:18.668
for the masses leaves me

31:18.751 --> 31:21.629
{\an1}exactly no time
to tend to my own needs?

31:21.713 --> 31:24.591
{\an1}Did I tell you that
my closet's in crisis?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.968
I'm, uh, sorry. I think.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.596
I need someone with taste
to buy my clothes.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.307
Be my fashion eyes and ears,
so to speak.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.474
Interested?

31:33.558 --> 31:36.144
In working directly for you?

31:36.227 --> 31:38.104
In being my personal shopper.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.690
I-I... I don't know.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.275
Is it yes or no?

31:42.358 --> 31:43.610
Can I take it part-time

31:43.693 --> 31:45.695
until something involving
design opens up?

31:47.030 --> 31:49.115
It's a yes.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.116
Good.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.201
And a thank you.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.955
(indistinct chatter)

31:56.039 --> 31:58.333
Wow, the band sounds great.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.960
{\an1}It's too bad
it's not a bigger crowd.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.504
I'm sure it'll pick up.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.632
Yeah, I'm not worried.

32:06.799 --> 32:08.635
It's okay, Ron.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.430
Hi.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.349
Enjoy the club, ladies.

32:15.808 --> 32:18.019
{\an3}I know this doesn't
sound very agent-like,

32:18.102 --> 32:19.145
but you look great.

32:19.228 --> 32:20.355
Oh, thanks.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.524
And, uh, for the invite
and the free pass.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.234
Place is really happening.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.527
Yeah, it will be.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.363
Just like you.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.697
If you stick with me.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.532
Oh, you just don't quit, do you?

32:31.616 --> 32:34.243
Well, that's what's going
to make me a great agent.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.996
{\an1}Oh, Steve, I know you're
going through a tough time

32:37.080 --> 32:38.706
with your friend
in the hospital,

32:38.790 --> 32:41.000
and for you to think of me
like this...

32:41.084 --> 32:44.379
Well, I just don't think
I've had the chance to properly

32:44.462 --> 32:45.463
thank you.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.342
Well... Carly! Hey!

32:49.425 --> 32:50.510
How's it going?

32:50.593 --> 32:53.054
{\an1}Well, things are slow,
next door anyway.

32:53.137 --> 32:56.057
{\an3}Uh, Carly's a
waitress next door.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.558
Charlotte's a client.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.560
Potential client.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.938
Tonight, I'm just
an honored guest.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.648
Right.

33:03.731 --> 33:04.941
Well, I should be getting back.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.526
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

33:06.609 --> 33:08.069
Please, I have to go.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.987
You know about that thing you
asked me, you know, the date?

33:10.071 --> 33:12.699
Well, the answer is no.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.578
Operator, I've tried her
direct line twice.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.581
I can't get an answer.
Could you try it for me?

33:20.665 --> 33:22.375
Yeah, it's room 305.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.502
Thanks.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.422
{\an6}(phone ringing)
She had a sudden
shortness of breath,

33:27.505 --> 33:28.756
{\an3}blacked out;
X-rays are on the way.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.633
{\an1}B.P. is
70 over palp.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.218
Heart rate's 140,
she's desaturated

33:32.301 --> 33:34.429
{\an1}down to 80 percent.
She's got JVD.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.264
{\an3}Right side of her heart's
totally distended.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.598
{\an3}It's a pulmonary embolus.
(ringing continues)

33:37.682 --> 33:39.434
She's post-op
and if we use a thrombolytic,

33:39.517 --> 33:41.060
she'll bleed through her wounds.
Let's get her in surgery.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.312
{\an3}Now!

33:43.396 --> 33:45.440
(ringing continues)

33:46.816 --> 33:48.317
Hello.

33:48.401 --> 33:49.986
Kel, is that you?

33:50.069 --> 33:51.279
Who is this?

33:51.362 --> 33:52.780
This is Kelly's boyfriend.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.532
I brought her in last night.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.617
Could you just tell her
it's Brandon on the phone?

33:56.701 --> 33:58.286
Kelly's developed
a complication.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.079
She's been taken up
into emergency surgery.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.456
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

34:01.539 --> 34:03.458
Listen, I can't talk right now.

34:03.541 --> 34:04.417
You should just come down here.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.710
(slams phone down)

34:15.887 --> 34:17.847
A pulmonary embolus?

34:17.929 --> 34:19.639
{\an3}A blood clot that passed
through Kelly's heart

34:19.724 --> 34:20.808
and lodged in her lungs.

34:20.891 --> 34:21.684
{\an3}But you got
it out, right?

34:21.768 --> 34:23.770
We restored blood flow
to her lungs.

34:23.853 --> 34:24.853
So she'll be okay, right?

34:24.937 --> 34:27.315
We were able to find a donor
with her blood type...

34:27.398 --> 34:28.440
That's Noah.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.692
...which should help
a great deal.

34:29.775 --> 34:32.820
But for a short time, Kelly's
brain was deprived of oxygen.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.405
We won't know for sure

34:34.489 --> 34:37.617
what damage, if any,
she suffered until she wakes up.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.664
(blues music playing)

34:43.748 --> 34:45.166
{\an1}I'm sorry about
this morning.

34:45.248 --> 34:48.043
Peace offering.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.641
{\an3}(gasps)

35:01.724 --> 35:03.518
Where did you find this?

35:03.601 --> 35:05.019
Well, if you must know,

35:05.103 --> 35:06.729
{\an1}the hospital gift shop
was selling them.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.191
It's beautiful.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.195
{\an3}Yeah, uh, David went
to the hospital

35:14.278 --> 35:15.822
{\an3}when Steve called
with the news.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.950
{\an1}So I'm kind
of closing up for him.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.204
You guys sure look after
each other.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.705
You're lucky to have that.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.958
What, and you don't?

35:29.961 --> 35:31.712
I love your taste in music.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.381
(volume increases)

35:33.464 --> 35:36.425
Yeah, growing up
I had these neighbors

35:36.509 --> 35:38.344
who loved to play the blues.

35:38.427 --> 35:41.305
You know, like Joe Turner
and Billie Holiday

35:41.389 --> 35:43.432
and Muddy Waters.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.433
I would lie in bed

35:44.517 --> 35:46.727
and listen to the songs
with the windows open

35:46.811 --> 35:48.855
over and over again.

35:49.981 --> 35:53.734
There was a lot of sadness
at my house.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.988
That song you were playing at
the dock.

35:57.071 --> 35:59.574
Yeah, that's how I met the
Blues. It's my favorite.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.784
Mine too.

36:01.868 --> 36:05.037
♪ ♪

36:28.144 --> 36:31.564
{\an1}I just can't stop thinking
if this had happened to you...

36:32.690 --> 36:34.734
(shudders)

36:36.193 --> 36:37.570
(sighs)

36:37.653 --> 36:39.405
You were right...

36:39.488 --> 36:41.991
in the apartment.

36:42.074 --> 36:44.452
{\an3}There was something
that I wasn't telling you.

36:48.205 --> 36:51.834
David and I...

36:51.918 --> 36:54.670
we, um...

36:54.754 --> 36:57.673
Oh, sweetheart, whatever it is,
just, just say it.

36:57.757 --> 37:00.176
We want to live together.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.681
I see.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.768
{\an3}We've put a lot
of thought into it.

37:08.851 --> 37:10.603
We both agree that it's time.

37:10.686 --> 37:13.439
Obviously, he's pressuring you.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.650
It's what <i> I</i> want.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.655
Is he pressuring you
to have sex?

37:24.283 --> 37:26.035
He doesn't have to.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.747
We love each other.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.626
I don't want to talk about this.
Mom...

37:33.709 --> 37:37.004
{\an3}I waited until I was
in a committed relationship.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.173
I said I don't want
to talk about this.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.050
{\an3}But, Mom,

37:41.133 --> 37:43.678
{\an3}it was...

37:43.761 --> 37:45.554
it was so loving.

37:45.638 --> 37:48.474
So romantic.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.559
It was perfect.

37:51.727 --> 37:54.355
{\an3}And I'm that proud
that I waited so long.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.525
I don't feel any guilt.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.241
{\an3}I wish that you
could be happy for me.

38:05.324 --> 38:08.119
I'm sure that you do.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.677
Hey, any update?

38:24.760 --> 38:26.345
No, nothing yet.

38:29.306 --> 38:30.599
Hi.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.560
{\an1}Hey, um,
will you walk with me?

38:32.643 --> 38:33.894
Please?

38:33.978 --> 38:35.604
Yeah.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.529
So I talked to my mom.

38:45.322 --> 38:46.741
You did?

38:46.824 --> 38:49.827
Yeah. It didn't go so well.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.164
Before we get into this...

38:54.623 --> 38:55.416
I want you to know

38:55.499 --> 38:57.376
{\an3}I'm really proud of you
for doing it.

39:01.213 --> 39:03.257
Thanks.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.930
All right, give me
the blow by blow.

39:10.014 --> 39:13.059
Okay, um...

39:13.142 --> 39:15.770
{\an1}I told her we wanted
to live together.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.605
And she said?

39:17.688 --> 39:19.940
Nothing... at least

39:20.024 --> 39:22.610
not until I told her
we'd slept together.

39:22.693 --> 39:23.861
You did? You didn't.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.241
Wow.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.578
{\an3}Whew, I'm really glad
you had this conversation

39:32.661 --> 39:33.913
{\an3}in a hospital;
did she check in?

39:33.996 --> 39:36.624
(laughs)
David...

39:36.707 --> 39:38.417
{\an3}I'm sorry it
went so badly.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.212
Aren't you glad it's out
in the open, though? I mean...

39:49.887 --> 39:51.680
{\an1}David?

39:51.764 --> 39:53.224
Tell me the truth.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.602
Are we committed
to each other or not?

39:56.685 --> 39:58.145
Donna...

39:58.229 --> 39:59.438
Just tell me.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.315
Of course we are.

40:02.566 --> 40:05.194
{\an1}Well then,
the answer is "yes."

40:06.695 --> 40:08.864
I am glad that
it's out in the open.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.789
No more sneaking around.

40:16.872 --> 40:18.874
No more secrets.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.677
{\an5}BRANDON:
I picked up our pictures
from Hawaii.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.929
Here we are on the beach.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.891
{\an3}This is the group shot
we took at the luau.

40:37.226 --> 40:41.021
{\an3}Ah, Steve's glow
in the dark sunburn.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.151
And this is the model
that used him as a night-light.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.236
(heart monitor beeping)

40:49.405 --> 40:51.699
This is the picture

40:51.782 --> 40:54.618
that Donna took of the two
of us at the luau.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.873
The "posterity shot."

40:58.956 --> 41:01.167
Remember?

41:02.585 --> 41:06.046
{\an3}She threatened to use
it as an invitation

41:06.130 --> 41:07.840
for the party
she wants to throw

41:07.923 --> 41:10.384
for our 50th wedding
anniversary.

41:26.442 --> 41:29.361
I'm trying really...

41:29.445 --> 41:33.073
really hard
to be strong here, Kel.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.996
Losing you once was hard enough.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.459
I don't know if I could take it
a second time.

41:50.716 --> 41:53.093
You got to come back to me.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.221
(sighs)

42:09.360 --> 42:11.237
Kel?

42:17.117 --> 42:18.160
(click)

42:18.244 --> 42:19.745
NURSE (over intercom):
Can I help you?

42:19.828 --> 42:22.623
Yeah, it's, uh, it's Kelly.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.291
I think she's waking up.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.964
{\an3}Kel?

42:31.173 --> 42:32.591
Hi.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.179
{\an3}Boy, am I glad
to see you.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.392
How you doing?

42:43.143 --> 42:44.520
Who are you?
