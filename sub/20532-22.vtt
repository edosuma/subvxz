01:11.605 --> 01:13.372
[pipes play tones]

01:13.374 --> 01:16.175
- What are you guys doing?
- Warming up our voices.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.610
¶ I'm so excited ¶

01:18.612 --> 01:20.612
¶ To check out ¶

01:20.614 --> 01:25.751
[harmonizing]
¶ The Performing Arts Academy ¶

01:25.753 --> 01:28.053
Wow, you guys sound great.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.789
That must be the Institute
for Science and Alchemy tent.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.857
Hi, Zandar.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.394
[fireworks whistling]

01:35.396 --> 01:38.730
And the Corinthian
Sports School tent.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.432
It all looks so fun.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.034
And you know about the wall,
don't you?

01:42.036 --> 01:45.737
- The wall?
- Oh, come on, I'll show you.

01:45.739 --> 01:49.608
This is the wall of next steps.
It's a time-honored tradition.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.911
- You write your school choice
on a tablet.
- That sounds interesting.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.813
Then you take the tablet
to the royal chiseler.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.649
And then he carves your choice
of school in stone.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.752
After that, your tablet
is magically put on the wall,

02:00.754 --> 02:02.721
and at noon,
there's an unveiling,

02:02.723 --> 02:05.824
and we get to show everyone
what schools we've picked.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.627
Hmm, which tent
should I go to first?

02:08.629 --> 02:10.496
I know, come with me, Sofia.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.797
Where are we going?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.832
To my favorite tent,
of course.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.767
It's a school where you learn
to be in charge

02:15.769 --> 02:17.169
and tell people what to do.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.671
Hey, Desmond, are you lost?

02:19.673 --> 02:21.673
The Science and Alchemy tent
is back that way.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.309
Well, deep down, I've always
wanted to be a hero.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.813
Wait, are you really interested
in becoming a knight?

02:27.815 --> 02:30.449
- But maybe I should
stick to books.
- Why?

02:30.451 --> 02:32.818
Because I really
don't know the first thing

02:32.820 --> 02:34.853
- about being a knight.
- It's a school!

02:34.855 --> 02:36.421
They'll teach you
how to do everything.

02:36.423 --> 02:39.691
Come on,
let's go in together.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.793
- Brilliant!
- [man] Welcome!

02:41.795 --> 02:45.831
As some of you may already know,
I am Sir Finnegan.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.867
Now, as a former student
of Chivalry Hall,

02:48.869 --> 02:50.669
they've asked me to show you

02:50.671 --> 02:52.871
what this fine school
is all about.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.873
Allow me to demonstrate

02:54.875 --> 02:57.276
the kinds of skills
you'd be learning,

02:57.278 --> 03:00.612
like how to toss a javelin!
[grunts]

03:00.614 --> 03:03.515
- Whoa!
- Amazing.

03:03.517 --> 03:08.554
Now [chuckles] who'd like
to give it a try?

03:14.562 --> 03:17.763
Impressive form,
my knights to be!

03:22.136 --> 03:25.070
Wow, it's like they're already
real knights.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.506
Want to give it a go, lad?

03:27.508 --> 03:29.908
Don't worry, Des,
those two may be good,

03:29.910 --> 03:32.077
but this isn't a competition.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.646
Come on,
what do you have to lose?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.251
[grunts]

03:42.690 --> 03:44.890
Ah, not the best effort,

03:44.892 --> 03:47.359
but if you want
to get better at it,

03:47.361 --> 03:50.062
Chivalry Hall
is the school for you.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.863
Here we are, Sofia,

03:51.865 --> 03:54.499
the school you were
meant to go to.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.935
[sighs]
Doesn't it just feel right?

03:56.937 --> 04:00.072
All the greatest rulers
and their advisors went here--

04:00.074 --> 04:01.773
Grandmum, Daddy--

04:01.775 --> 04:05.777
Oh! And just think,
if you go here,

04:05.779 --> 04:08.614
you can become
<i>my</i> royal advisor one day.

04:08.616 --> 04:12.918
Welcome to the finest tent
at the Royal School Fair.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.954
At EverRealm Academy,
you will learn

04:15.956 --> 04:19.424
how to be future rulers
and advisors, just as I,

04:19.426 --> 04:22.127
King Habib,
did when I studied there.

04:22.129 --> 04:25.297
To show you the kinds of things
you would learn at EverRealm,

04:25.299 --> 04:28.934
we will start by making
a magical coat of arms

04:28.936 --> 04:30.969
for your own personal kingdom!

04:30.971 --> 04:33.972
But how do we know
what to put

04:33.974 --> 04:35.874
on our coat of arms,
King Habib?

04:35.876 --> 04:38.243
Ah, I'm so glad you asked.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.213
Think about three symbols
you would want

04:41.215 --> 04:43.215
to represent your own kingdom.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.617
Only three?
That's tough.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.820
Indeed it is.
As is ruling a kingdom.

04:48.822 --> 04:53.125
Hmm, well, I'd want
my kingdom to have heart,

04:53.127 --> 04:54.693
so...

04:56.430 --> 05:00.599
Wow, okay,
I also can't imagine a kingdom

05:00.601 --> 05:04.136
without family and friends.

05:06.507 --> 05:11.677
I see this in rubies,
diamonds and... pearls.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.645
Perfect.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.981
Very nice, Princess Sofia.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.650
Oh, exceptional,
Princess Amber.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.019
See? Isn't this fun?

05:21.021 --> 05:23.188
Ooh, can't you see yourself
going here?

05:23.190 --> 05:27.626
It is fun, but I could see
myself at other schools, too.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.861
Oh, this is just the tip
of the royal iceberg.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.664
Can you imagine
if we both went here,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.434
the two Enchancian princesses?

05:35.436 --> 05:38.270
- [violin music playing]
- Do you hear that?

05:38.272 --> 05:41.206
I think it's coming from the
Performing Arts Academy tent.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.008
Next up, my young royals,

05:43.010 --> 05:45.877
how to throw a royal ball.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.947
Sofia? Where are you going?
Don't you want to stay?

05:48.949 --> 05:52.217
I just want to check this out.
I'll see you later, Amber.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.885
[violin music continues]

05:57.124 --> 06:00.025
[yelps and gasps]

06:00.027 --> 06:02.461
So this is where
everyone's been hiding.

06:04.298 --> 06:08.133
[laughs]
Welcome, my darlings,

06:08.135 --> 06:11.136
to the Performing Arts
Academy tent!

06:11.138 --> 06:15.240
Oh, I never would have been
as legendary as I am

06:15.242 --> 06:18.710
if I hadn't gone
to this wonderful school.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.046
So grab an instrument.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.248
Join in the music making!

06:23.250 --> 06:26.685
Thank you, but I already know
what school I'm going to.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.554
I'm just here to see a friend.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.591
Cleo, it's time to go visit
our school now,

06:32.593 --> 06:34.526
the School of Royal Fashions.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.595
Our top choice, remember?

06:36.597 --> 06:38.630
Uh, Cleo?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.770
Ha ha!

06:44.772 --> 06:48.373
Magical music is just one
of the very fun things

06:48.375 --> 06:50.675
you will learn at our school.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.911
[lilting music plays]

06:58.752 --> 07:01.753
Ah, excellent, Princess Cleo.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.088
That was so fun.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.557
- A-mazing.
- Whoo-hoo!

07:05.559 --> 07:09.628
I suppose, but I must be going
to my dream school now.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.396
Cleo, did you hear me?

07:11.398 --> 07:13.965
- I'm leaving.
- Bye, Hildy, have fun!

07:13.967 --> 07:18.403
Don't try to stop me.
I'm really going now.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.105
Ohh!

07:20.107 --> 07:24.976
Next I will demonstrate
a dance you will learn

07:24.978 --> 07:27.612
if you come to
the Performing Arts Academy,

07:27.614 --> 07:29.414
the Tangu tango!

07:29.416 --> 07:31.216
[grunting]

07:36.623 --> 07:38.623
Isn't this school the best?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.792
We've got to go here,
you guys.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.395
Let's put all of our choices
down at the same time.

07:43.397 --> 07:45.597
Oh, Sofia,
are you going to join us?

07:45.599 --> 07:49.100
I don't know.
I do love performing.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.937
But I also liked making
my coat of arms.

07:51.939 --> 07:55.173
Jun! I'm going to see
how she's doing.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.175
I'll see you guys later.

07:57.177 --> 08:01.146
Jun, you look confused.
Are you having trouble deciding?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.614
'Cause I am, too.

08:02.616 --> 08:06.117
No, I just can't get
this pen to work.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.019
Oh, there we go.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.922
- You decided already?
- Yep, see?

08:10.924 --> 08:12.691
I'm going to the Science
and Alchemy school.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.992
What about you?

08:13.994 --> 08:17.128
I'm still not sure,
but that's great, Jun.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.698
- I'm happy for you.
- Can I help you, Sofia?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.199
They'll be unveiling
the wall soon.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.435
No, that's okay,
I better get going.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.669
I need to pick something,

08:24.671 --> 08:27.105
and I've got a lot
of tents to visit.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.706
Sofia, I've been looking
all over for you.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.742
Have you decided what school
you're going to choose?

09:03.744 --> 09:06.044
Well... not yet.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.179
It sort of seems
like everyone knows

09:08.181 --> 09:09.881
where they want to go but me.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.817
You've got to pick something.
Time is running out.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.252
- Yeah.
- Come on.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.689
- You have to choose.
- I'm still not sure.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.691
There must be a tent
I haven't tried yet.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.192
What about Chivalry Hall?

09:21.194 --> 09:22.727
James and I are headed
back there now.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.930
Yes! I haven't been
to that one yet.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.064
Show me!

09:28.335 --> 09:29.568
[horse whinnies]

09:29.570 --> 09:32.070
So, what's this school
all about, guys?

09:32.072 --> 09:34.906
Well, this is where we practice
our jousting skills.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.708
Why don't you give it a try,
Sof?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.443
Jousting? Sounds fun.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.187
Yah!

09:52.759 --> 09:54.192
[grunts]

09:56.296 --> 09:58.363
[crowd cheers]

09:58.365 --> 10:01.266
- Way to go, Sofia!
- Yeah, Sofia!

10:01.268 --> 10:06.071
[laughs] Nicely done, Princess.
Have you jousted before?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.073
Uh, no, not really.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.242
Well, you could've fooled me.
Anyone else want to try?

10:11.244 --> 10:14.913
I can't believe you were so good
at that on your first try.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.982
How do you know you won't be
good at it, too?

10:16.984 --> 10:18.316
I know I won't be<i> that</i> good.

10:20.487 --> 10:23.888
The trick is to hold the lance
firmly, like this.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.925
You see? Come on,
give it a try, boy-o!

10:26.927 --> 10:28.360
Yah? Whoa!

10:31.665 --> 10:32.731
Oh, no!

10:51.485 --> 10:53.585
Des, are you okay?

10:53.587 --> 10:55.253
Everyone's better than me
at this stuff,

10:55.255 --> 10:57.789
even other kids
who never tried it before.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.592
Who am I kidding?
I don't belong at Chivalry Hall.

11:00.594 --> 11:04.996
- Come on, Des.
- So much for being a hero.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.299
Looks like it's
Science and Alchemy for me.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.701
[horse whinnies]

11:09.703 --> 11:11.536
What about you, Sof?

11:11.538 --> 11:13.371
Is it gonna be
Chivalry Hall for you?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.840
Eh, it could be, I guess.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.442
Sofia, what are you doing?

11:17.444 --> 11:19.377
The wall unveiling's
going to start soon.

11:19.379 --> 11:23.348
Amber, I know,
it's just how can I choose

11:23.350 --> 11:27.185
between magical music,
enchanted ice dancing, jousting?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.853
Everyone has to decide.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.389
If you don't, you may not have
a school to go to.

11:31.391 --> 11:36.027
But it really seems unfair
to make us decide in one day.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.297
Oh, Sofia, don't overthink it.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.966
This is how it's been done
for years.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.836
Generations of royals
can't be wrong.

11:44.838 --> 11:48.973
<i> ¶ So you're having a hard time</i>
<i> deciding what to do ¶</i>

11:48.975 --> 11:52.644
<i>¶ It's a good thing I'm here to</i>
<i>help you see things through ¶</i>

11:52.646 --> 11:56.047
<i>¶ The choice you need is clear,</i>
<i>anyone can see ¶</i>

11:56.049 --> 12:00.552
<i> ¶ You've got to go to</i>
<i> EverRealm Academy with me ¶</i>

12:00.554 --> 12:03.154
[sighs] I don't know.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.156
<i> ¶ Come on, Sofia ¶</i>

12:05.158 --> 12:07.425
<i> ¶ All you've got to do</i>

12:40.460 --> 12:42.527
- Maybe.

But it's so permanent.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.931
<i> ¶ Yes,</i>
<i> we really want to know ¶</i>

13:52.933 --> 13:57.435
<i> ¶ Just what you're gonna do ¶</i>

13:57.437 --> 14:01.172
<i> ¶ What you're gonna do ¶</i>

14:01.174 --> 14:06.644
<i> ¶ What you're gonna do-o-o ¶</i>

14:06.646 --> 14:09.614
So?
What's it gonna be, Sofia?

14:09.616 --> 14:12.817
-[bell tolling]
- I-- [grunts]
I just don't know, okay?

14:12.819 --> 14:15.153
Hurry, children.
The bell is rung.

14:15.155 --> 14:19.157
The unveiling of the wall
will be starting soon.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.860
Oh,
Sofia's going to miss out.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.729
It would be wrong
to pick for her.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.866
But if I don't
put something down,

14:27.868 --> 14:30.301
she might not<i> have </i>
a next school.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.406
[sighs]
Sorry, again, Zandar.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.476
Des, you can't just give up
on your dream.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.245
[sighs] I'm just facing facts.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.547
Science and alchemy
is my thing.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.582
Being a hero is not.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.418
Come on, it was only
a couple of demonstrations.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.587
Yeah,
if I can't even do those,

14:49.589 --> 14:51.723
there's no way I'll make it
in knight school.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.559
[sighs] Face it, James,
this is where I belong,

14:54.561 --> 14:57.462
where I know what I'm doing
and nothing can go wrong.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.568
Let's go, children,
hurry now, to the wall.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.241
Sofia, I have exciting news.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.511
I know, I know, but I still
haven't picked a school.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.513
Well, then you'll love this.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.616
Because surprise!
I picked one for you.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.719
- What?
- It's already at the wall
waiting to be carved in stone.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.621
Amber, how could you?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.256
Time was almost up,

15:25.258 --> 15:26.925
and you had to put
something down.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.726
I figured since
you had to go somewhere,

15:28.728 --> 15:30.929
the best place was with me.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.730
But I like other schools, too.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.800
Well, you have to pick one.
That's the rules.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.436
That doesn't mean you get
to choose my school for me.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.606
- I need to fix this.
- Sofia, wait!

15:41.608 --> 15:43.708
[crash]

15:53.586 --> 15:55.720
Is there anyone inside
that armor?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.288
Doesn't look like it.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.489
Then how is it dueling?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.558
The only thing
that could possibly cause that

16:00.560 --> 16:03.628
- is a come-to-lifeium potion.
- A what?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.397
It's a potion that makes
inanimate objects come to life.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.066
Some must have spilled
on the armor.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.838
Sofia, look out!

16:17.677 --> 16:19.577
Hold on, Sof, I'm coming!

16:24.184 --> 16:26.150
I'll make a potion to stop it!

16:29.689 --> 16:32.156
Oh, please, let me pass.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.694
Look, Mr. Knight,
there's a tablet

16:36.696 --> 16:38.696
with my face on it
that I really need to find.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.599
Ah! Oh, boy.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.503
Here, take this!

16:52.946 --> 16:55.747
Here, pour this on the armor.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.891
Thanks, guys, I owe you one.

17:09.963 --> 17:11.629
Well done, lads.

17:11.631 --> 17:15.400
Now that was quick thinking
on your part, Prince Desmond.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.169
I didn't do anything.
James poured the potion.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.804
Which you made.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.240
I never would've stopped
that armor if it wasn't for you.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.542
- You're a hero!
- But I'm not a knight.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.346
No one ever said you had
to be a knight to be a hero.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.648
That's right,
you're a hero alchemist.

17:30.650 --> 17:34.252
Indeed, and there is
a long tradition of alchemists

17:34.254 --> 17:37.622
and knights working together
to save kingdoms.

17:39.592 --> 17:45.263
Welcome to the finale
of the Royal School Fair,

17:45.265 --> 17:49.767
the unveiling
of the Wall of Next Steps.

17:49.769 --> 17:53.938
[fanfare plays]

17:53.940 --> 17:55.039
I'm too late.

17:55.041 --> 17:58.409
The curtain, if you will.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.477
Oh, no!

18:02.682 --> 18:04.882
As you can see on our wall,

18:04.884 --> 18:07.618
each member
of our graduating class

18:07.620 --> 18:12.223
has chosen where they will go
after they leave Royal Prep.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.626
So, children, come forward

18:15.628 --> 18:18.029
and see
what your fellow students

18:18.031 --> 18:21.532
have chosen
for their next schools.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.268
Wow, Zoe, you're going to
the School for Adventure?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.603
Well, where else would I go?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.773
Oh, Chivalry Hall.
Way to go, James!

18:28.775 --> 18:31.809
Khalid, you're going to
the School of Royal Fashions?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.811
Surprise!

18:33.813 --> 18:35.913
[gasps]
EverRealm Academy!

18:35.915 --> 18:37.748
Congratulations, Amber.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.784
You're following
in your family's footsteps.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.252
What about you, Hildy?

18:41.254 --> 18:44.655
Oh, the School
for Royal Fashions, of course.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.291
It'll be weird going
to a different school

18:47.293 --> 18:48.659
than you, Hildy.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.761
I know
that you're mad at me, but--

18:50.763 --> 18:53.631
Actually, Cleo,
you made the right choice.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.734
You were born to perform.
I'll miss you.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.469
I'll miss you, too, Hildy.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.671
Sofia, you're going
to EverRealm Academy?

19:00.673 --> 19:01.639
Amazing.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.174
No, I'm not.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.909
Sofia, what are you doing?

19:04.911 --> 19:06.777
But it says so right there.

19:06.779 --> 19:07.845
No, it doesn't.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.280
It does so!

19:09.282 --> 19:11.349
No, Amber, it doesn't.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.986
I didn't choose that school.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.388
I'm going to erase it.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.193
[all gasp]

19:22.195 --> 19:24.929
Children, well,
what's going on here?

19:24.931 --> 19:28.299
Sofia,
what happened to the wall?

19:28.301 --> 19:30.368
I'm sorry,
Miss Merryweather,

19:30.370 --> 19:32.670
but the truth is
I like all the schools.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.772
I don't want to pick just one.

19:34.774 --> 19:39.143
I'm sure this is all
a big misunderstanding.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.679
You had the most fun
with me at EverRealm.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.147
Right, Sofia?

19:43.149 --> 19:45.516
I had fun
at all the schools today.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.819
So? Which school do you want
to go to then?

19:48.821 --> 19:51.789
Sofia, it's a simple question.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.959
It's not simple at all.
That's the problem.

19:58.898 --> 20:02.366
At first, I was really excited
about the fair,

20:02.368 --> 20:04.202
but it's too big a decision.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.037
I don't know
what I want to do.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.540
You know, I'm not really sure
what I want to do either.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.709
- You're not?
- Not really.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.811
I just put something down
so I wouldn't miss out.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.313
Me too.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.748
[sighs] I'm so glad
I'm not the only one.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.917
It's too hard
to decide in one day.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.719
I wish
we didn't have to pick.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.854
Children, please, please.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.891
This tradition exists
for a reason.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.894
There comes a time
in each of our lives

20:29.896 --> 20:32.496
where we all
must make a choice.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.733
But that doesn't mean
your choice has to last forever.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.936
Did you know that
once upon a time,

20:38.938 --> 20:41.939
I wanted to be
a tooth fairy?

20:41.941 --> 20:45.109
- You did?
- That was my first choice.

20:45.111 --> 20:49.280
But after a while,
I found a different path,

20:49.282 --> 20:51.849
and perhaps so shall you.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.017
Ladies?

21:02.762 --> 21:07.798
In keeping with tradition,
you must all make a choice.

21:07.800 --> 21:13.104
But if you're not sure,
you can always change your mind.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.541
So go forth and write

21:17.543 --> 21:20.244
whatever school you wish
on this wall.

21:20.246 --> 21:24.048
And no matter what we choose,
it won't be forever?

21:24.050 --> 21:25.883
Oh, nothing is, my dear.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.389
Sofia, I hope
you're not mad at me.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.659
It's just we're all going off
in different directions,

21:34.661 --> 21:38.596
and I didn't want that
for you and me.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.799
It's okay, Amber.
I know you were trying to help.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.468
But how about next time
asking

21:44.470 --> 21:46.937
before making such a big
decision for someone else?

21:46.939 --> 21:48.973
Great idea.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.009
So which school
<i> are</i> you picking?

21:57.984 --> 21:59.784
Actually, Amber,

21:59.786 --> 22:02.653
I think I'll be happy
with you at EverRealm.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.522
For now.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.823
Yes!

22:05.825 --> 22:09.093
[laughs]
Well, I'm glad that's settled

22:09.095 --> 22:11.028
because it's time to celebrate.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.197
