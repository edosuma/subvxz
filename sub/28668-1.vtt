When my husband passed,

you know after I took
care of everything,

17:42.522 --> 17:45.621
I used what was left of the

So.

17:47.189 --> 17:48.089

33:49.588 --> 33:50.922
- Don't make me
lay your ass out.

33:50.922 --> 33:51.755
Leave.

33:57.456 --> 33:58.489
- Girl, what's going on?

33:58.489 --> 34:00.322
- Girl, niggas, shit.

34:00.322 --> 34:02.588
(laughing)

34:02.588 --> 34:06.356
("Summertime" by Lena Horne)

34:07.755 --> 34:11.155
- Tracey girl, it feels so
good to be away from the office

34:11.155 --> 34:12.489
and just relax.

34:12.489 --> 34:14.755
- I know exactly
what you mean girl.

34:14.755 --> 34:15.955
Not being in that office.

34:15.955 --> 34:17.322
Not dealing with any clients.

34:17.322 --> 34:18.556
Not dealing with any cases.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.588
I love all of my home time.

34:20.588 --> 34:21.922
- I know.

34:21.922 --> 34:24.289
And I have so much
I need to tell you.

34:24.289 --> 34:26.788
About what's going on.

34:26.788 --> 34:28.989
- Okay now, let me turn this
music down for a little bit.

34:28.989 --> 34:30.989
And sit down with you.

34:30.989 --> 34:32.989
(sighs)

34:34.389 --> 34:37.389
Come on now lady, tell me
what's going on with you okay?

34:37.389 --> 34:38.922
- Okay.

34:38.922 --> 34:42.621
Well, lately I've been having
these really crazy nightmares.

34:42.621 --> 34:44.055
And it's crazy because every

34:44.055 --> 34:46.055
since these nightmares
have started,

34:46.055 --> 34:47.289
David's been distant.

34:47.289 --> 34:49.788
And he's just not the same.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.422
He's not acting the same.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.422
And I haven't told anyone
else about my nightmares

34:53.422 --> 34:56.655
or anything but they're
really starting to scare me.

34:56.655 --> 34:59.022
- You haven't thought about
seeking professional help?

34:59.022 --> 35:00.556
Not talking to anyone?

35:00.556 --> 35:02.456
- I have not thought
about doing that.

35:02.456 --> 35:03.289
No.

35:04.356 --> 35:05.788
No.

35:05.788 --> 35:08.255
- Mona, you're gonna
have to talk to somebody.

35:08.255 --> 35:10.655
You're gonna have to get this
taken care of right away.

35:10.655 --> 35:12.588
You can't let this come
between you and David.

35:12.588 --> 35:14.588
You know how much
that man loves you.

35:14.588 --> 35:16.356
- I know, I know.

35:16.356 --> 35:18.755
- You do know that I will always
be here for you, don't you?

35:18.755 --> 35:20.022
- I do.

35:20.022 --> 35:23.688
(reflective dramatic music)

35:33.055 --> 35:35.255
- So Mona, what
brings you in today?

35:35.255 --> 35:39.588
- Well, I have been having
these horrible nightmares.

35:39.588 --> 35:40.922
I mean they're terrible.

35:40.922 --> 35:44.189
And they always seem
to involve death.

35:44.189 --> 35:45.588
I wake up in a cold sweat.

35:45.588 --> 35:47.022
I'm screaming.

35:47.022 --> 35:50.722
And now, my husband
David has been showing up

35:50.722 --> 35:54.755
in these dreams along with
my first husband, John.

35:54.755 --> 35:56.888
And I don't know
what's going on.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.588
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

35:59.588 --> 36:01.055
I don't know what's going on.

36:01.055 --> 36:04.322
You have any idea what
could be happening to me?

36:04.322 --> 36:06.788
- Have you been
working a lot of hours?

36:06.788 --> 36:08.755
- Mmm, yeah a little bit.

36:08.755 --> 36:10.888
- You been getting
the proper rest?

36:10.888 --> 36:13.356
- Probably not like I should.

36:13.356 --> 36:16.422
- Well maybe you need
something to help you to relax.

36:16.422 --> 36:19.389
And I can probably give you
something that will help.

36:19.389 --> 36:20.621
- Okay.

36:20.621 --> 36:22.055
- Yeah, but there's
no guarantees though.

36:22.055 --> 36:25.389
- I mean well if, if you
think it'll help, I'll try it.

36:25.389 --> 36:27.089
I'll try anything.

36:27.089 --> 36:29.489
- Well let's monitor
it and see how it goes.

36:29.489 --> 36:30.322
- Okay.

36:32.922 --> 36:35.588
(phone ringing)

36:36.955 --> 36:39.289
- Detective Brown, Homicide.

36:40.556 --> 36:44.189
And whom may I ask,
I'm speaking with?

36:44.189 --> 36:45.022
Okay.

36:47.089 --> 36:50.122
Yes, your name can
remain anonymous.

36:50.122 --> 36:52.456
(dramatic music)

36:52.456 --> 36:54.688
Let me get a pen and a pad.

36:56.189 --> 36:58.189
I do remember that case.

36:59.422 --> 37:01.556
Yeah, it was brutal.

37:01.556 --> 37:03.222
A cold case at that.

37:05.289 --> 37:06.122
Really?

37:08.122 --> 37:10.422
You have information on that?

37:57.588 --> 38:00.189

- Well the good part will
be there tomorrow too.

38:10.755 --> 38:13.289

important you have to do that

38:17.955 --> 38:18.788

going on around here?

- Good morning.

39:30.688 --> 39:31.655
- Good morning.

39:31.655 --> 39:32.855
- Is mom okay?

39:32.855 --> 39:35.489
She's usually up by now.

39:35.489 --> 39:37.322
- I hope so baby girl.

39:37.322 --> 39:39.621
She's been having bad
nightmares lately.

39:39.621 --> 39:41.422
- Well I'm sure ma will be okay.

Stop pointing that gun at me.

40:11.855 --> 40:12.988
What's wrong with you?

40:12.988 --> 40:14.189
- You don't love me.

40:14.189 --> 40:15.522
- What?

40:15.522 --> 40:17.621
- You don't love Armani.

40:17.621 --> 40:18.955
- You don't love this house.

40:18.955 --> 40:20.621
And you don't love God.

40:20.621 --> 40:21.588
(laughing)

40:21.588 --> 40:22.522
You don't.
- Uh ha.

40:22.522 --> 40:23.456
- Wait wait wait wait wait.

Have you lost your damn mind?

Really.

I'm out!

40:59.489 --> 41:00.322
I'm out!

41:01.556 --> 41:04.255
(dramatic music)

41:12.255 --> 41:15.322
- Hey Tracey, this is Hazel.

41:15.322 --> 41:16.855
I tried to call Mona.

41:16.855 --> 41:18.189
I'm up here at work.

41:18.189 --> 41:19.022
And she's not here.

41:19.022 --> 41:20.389
This is not like her.

41:20.389 --> 41:21.621
I don't know what to do.

41:21.621 --> 41:24.356
I called and all I can
hear is some breathing.

41:24.356 --> 41:25.588
- [Tracey] Okay look, now look.

41:25.588 --> 41:27.055
I'm about to call Dawn
and I'm on my way okay.

41:27.055 --> 41:28.722
- Okay, okay

41:28.722 --> 41:29.922
- All right.
- All right.

41:29.922 --> 41:30.755
- Okay.
- All right.

41:30.755 --> 41:31.688
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:31.688 --> 41:33.122
- You know I hope Mona is okay.

41:33.122 --> 41:34.556
- [Dawn] I hope she is too.

41:34.556 --> 41:38.089
You know I just got off
the phone with Hazel.

41:38.089 --> 41:40.855

41:40.855 --> 41:43.322
I just hope we don't find her
dead, that's what I'm hoping.

41:57.222 --> 42:00.189

42:03.322 --> 42:04.155
- Whew.

42:04.155 --> 42:06.022
(faint dialogue)

42:06.022 --> 42:08.722
(dramatic music)

42:11.556 --> 42:12.888
- [Dawn] Oh hell no.

42:12.888 --> 42:14.888
- What's going on, Mona?

42:14.888 --> 42:15.988
Mona!

42:15.988 --> 42:16.822
- Mona!

42:16.822 --> 42:17.955
- Mona!

42:17.955 --> 42:20.289
(dramatic music)

42:20.289 --> 42:21.688
- What is going on?

42:21.688 --> 42:22.855
- Girl, I don't know.

42:22.855 --> 42:24.456
I just hope we
don't find her dead.

42:24.456 --> 42:27.522
(dramatic music)

42:27.522 --> 42:29.055
- It's open, oh God.

42:29.055 --> 42:30.356
Mona.

42:30.356 --> 42:31.189
- Mona?

42:32.722 --> 42:33.556
Mona.

42:35.688 --> 42:36.688
Mona
- Mona!

42:38.788 --> 42:39.621
- Mona?

42:43.722 --> 42:45.322
Mona.
- Mona!

42:45.322 --> 42:47.255
- Mona.
- Mona.

42:47.255 --> 42:48.556
- Mona!

42:48.556 --> 42:50.888
Mona, what happened?

42:50.888 --> 42:52.489
What happened Mona?

42:52.489 --> 42:54.089
Where is David?

42:54.089 --> 42:55.289
- Mona, what's wrong?

42:55.289 --> 42:56.122
Talk to us.

42:56.122 --> 42:56.955
- Snap out of it.

42:56.955 --> 42:58.189
What's wrong?

42:58.189 --> 42:59.556
- Can you hear us
talking to you?

42:59.556 --> 43:01.422
- Mona.
- Mona.

43:01.422 --> 43:03.788
- Dawn, I need for
you to call David.

43:03.788 --> 43:05.489
And tell her that we're
taking her to the hospital.

43:05.489 --> 43:06.489
- Oh hell no.

43:06.489 --> 43:07.755
We need to call 911.

43:07.755 --> 43:09.422
We can call David later.

43:09.422 --> 43:11.155
- Okay, what I need
for you do then

43:11.155 --> 43:12.389
is to look anywhere
for her medicine.

43:12.389 --> 43:13.655
I don't know where it is.

43:13.655 --> 43:14.722
But she told me that she
was going to the doctor

43:14.722 --> 43:16.222
a few days ago

43:16.222 --> 43:17.621
and we need to be sure that
she did not take too much.

43:17.621 --> 43:18.655
- [Dawn] You know
what, you right.

43:18.655 --> 43:20.155
- Mona.

43:20.155 --> 43:21.955
- Oh my God, all this?

43:21.955 --> 43:23.255
(dramatic music)

43:23.255 --> 43:25.989
(pills rattling)

43:29.422 --> 43:30.621
This is all I could find.

43:30.621 --> 43:31.456
- [Tracey] Okay that's fine.

43:31.456 --> 43:33.621
(faint dialogue)

43:33.621 --> 43:36.389
(dramatic music)

43:38.755 --> 43:40.089
- Come on, come on.

43:40.089 --> 43:42.855
(dramatic music)

43:48.022 --> 43:49.055
Sit, go on over there.

43:49.055 --> 43:49.888
Come on Mona.

43:49.888 --> 43:52.655
(dramatic music)

44:04.122 --> 44:06.688
(somber music)

44:13.189 --> 44:16.055
- Now I prescribed
Zoloft and Tegrital.

44:16.055 --> 44:18.055
Now I think the Zoloft
should help her to relax

44:18.055 --> 44:19.456
and get a little rest.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.755
And now she's been
having these dreams.

44:21.755 --> 44:24.489
So the Tegrital should
help take care of that.

44:24.489 --> 44:27.122
I think that combination
is probably the best way

44:27.122 --> 44:29.621
to go to things under control.

44:33.456 --> 44:34.722
- Where is she?

44:34.722 --> 44:37.389
- Calm down David,
she's in room 303.

44:38.788 --> 44:39.989
- Are you the husband?

44:39.989 --> 44:41.222
- Yes, I am.

44:41.222 --> 44:42.788
- Well sir, she's
resting comfortably.

44:42.788 --> 44:44.189
She will be okay.

44:45.588 --> 44:49.788
- (sighs) Thank God 'cause
she wasn't okay this morning.

44:49.788 --> 44:51.688
- Follow me this way.

44:51.688 --> 44:54.422
(dramatic music)

45:01.122 --> 45:02.822
- Hey Doc!

45:02.822 --> 45:04.722
What kind of fucked
up medication you
got my wife on man?

45:04.722 --> 45:07.055
- Look I'll answer any
questions you might have

45:07.055 --> 45:09.755
but you have got to calm down.

45:09.755 --> 45:11.688
Ladies, give us a moment.

45:11.688 --> 45:14.389
(dramatic music)

45:17.289 --> 45:20.755
Look sir, we're trying to get
the situation under control.

45:20.755 --> 45:22.922
- (scoffs) Whatever man.

45:22.922 --> 45:24.955

45:24.955 --> 45:26.489
- David, what's happening?

45:26.489 --> 45:28.456
Are you guys okay?

45:28.456 --> 45:29.289
- No.

45:32.588 --> 45:34.422
- Nurse Roxie, could you
tell us a little bit more

45:34.422 --> 45:37.122
about this PTSD
disorder that Mona has?

45:37.122 --> 45:40.189
- PTSD is a combination
of symptoms that occur

45:40.189 --> 45:42.089
from traumatic events.

45:42.089 --> 45:44.955
This is usually characterized
by intrusive behavior,

45:44.955 --> 45:46.989
flashbacks and
nightmares of things

45:46.989 --> 45:48.822
that have happened
in their past.

45:48.822 --> 45:50.289
Please watch her carefully.

45:50.289 --> 45:52.022
- Okay.
- We will allow her to go home

45:52.022 --> 45:53.988
but this is something
that's really gonna need

45:53.988 --> 45:55.055
to be watched.

45:55.055 --> 45:56.255
- Okay thank you.

45:56.255 --> 45:57.222
- Can she work?

45:57.222 --> 45:58.722
- Yes.

45:58.722 --> 46:00.688
- Can y'all give her
something different?

46:00.688 --> 46:01.922
- It's up to the doctor.

46:01.922 --> 46:03.855
You're gonna have
to ask him that.

46:03.855 --> 46:05.189
- Roxie thank you so much.

46:05.189 --> 46:06.389
- Thank you so much.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.456
- We really appreciate
it, thank you.

46:08.456 --> 46:10.122
- I appreciate it and I
hope she feels better.

46:10.122 --> 46:11.189
- Thank you.

46:12.222 --> 46:15.888
(faint TV background noise)

46:24.489 --> 46:25.755
- Good evening.

46:29.955 --> 46:31.621
I said good evening!

46:34.189 --> 46:36.122
- (sighs) What's up Bee?

46:36.122 --> 46:39.222
- Why you not at the
hospital with Mona?

46:39.222 --> 46:42.022
- I've been there already.

46:42.022 --> 46:43.788
I'll go back when
they release her.

46:43.788 --> 46:46.389
Well hell, whatever David.

46:46.389 --> 46:47.722

Don't worry.

50:09.588 --> 50:11.022
I'll see him.

50:11.022 --> 50:12.822
- Girl, I'm so sorry, I
brought him over to meet you.

50:12.822 --> 50:13.955

We're gonna do an autopsy.

1:06:03.089 --> 1:06:05.255
So we can determine
what happened.

1:06:05.255 --> 1:06:06.556
- And I know she's behind this.

1:06:06.556 --> 1:06:07.788
I just know it.

1:06:10.322 --> 1:06:12.755

1:06:12.755 --> 1:06:15.589
We were not able to
save your husband.

some things I want to
have clarification about

1:07:09.389 --> 1:07:10.922
regarding her husband.

1:07:10.922 --> 1:07:13.122
- Obviously not today because
she did just lose her husband.

1:07:13.122 --> 1:07:14.621
- [Detective Brown]
Right, right, right.

1:07:14.621 --> 1:07:16.722
- So let me think about
this for a few days.

1:07:16.722 --> 1:07:17.922
And I'll get back with you.

1:07:17.922 --> 1:07:18.855
How about that?
- No problem.

1:07:18.855 --> 1:07:21.022
No problem, take your time.

1:07:25.621 --> 1:07:28.222
How did your first husband die?

1:07:29.122 --> 1:07:30.556
Hmm?

1:07:30.556 --> 1:07:33.322
Did you get money
from his death?

1:07:38.456 --> 1:07:40.855
Did you talk to him that day?

1:07:43.089 --> 1:07:44.522
Do you know you were the
last one who spoke with him?

1:07:44.522 --> 1:07:46.522
(sighs)

1:07:50.222 --> 1:07:51.688
What's your plans?

1:07:51.688 --> 1:07:53.289
You were with him earlier.

1:07:53.289 --> 1:07:54.122
Come on!

1:07:55.122 --> 1:07:57.289
What you got Banks?

1:07:57.289 --> 1:07:59.055
- So did you know that
you were the last one

1:07:59.055 --> 1:08:02.489
to talk to him 10
minutes before he died?

1:08:04.655 --> 1:08:08.055
Why did you ask him
to stop at the store?

1:08:08.055 --> 1:08:11.922
Were you planning on
divorcing him or something?

1:08:11.922 --> 1:08:15.489
Now I know you know he had
another woman he was seeing.

1:08:15.489 --> 1:08:19.522
Do you know he had a
relationship with another woman?

1:08:19.522 --> 1:08:21.888
Is that why you
wanted to kill him?

1:08:21.888 --> 1:08:23.556
Wanted him dead?

1:08:23.556 --> 1:08:28.155
- Oh you mean, you and husband
were having marital problems?

1:08:28.155 --> 1:08:31.522
- That's why you
wanted him dead.

1:08:31.522 --> 1:08:32.589
- You telling me
you and your husband

1:08:32.589 --> 1:08:34.788
had marital problems mama?

1:08:34.788 --> 1:08:35.621
Huh?

1:08:36.522 --> 1:08:37.356
Huh!

1:08:39.621 --> 1:08:43.389
- I know this is a very
difficult time for you Mona.

1:08:43.389 --> 1:08:47.788
But I do wanna let you know
that we are here for you.

1:08:49.222 --> 1:08:53.489
- (sighs) With all
due respect Dr. Big,

1:08:53.489 --> 1:08:56.022
you have absolutely no idea

1:08:56.022 --> 1:08:58.788
how difficult this
has been for me.

1:08:58.788 --> 1:09:00.389
You know I have cried.

1:09:00.389 --> 1:09:01.855
I have begged.

1:09:01.855 --> 1:09:04.755
I even prayed to God that
he would forgive those

1:09:04.755 --> 1:09:07.089
who came against David and I.

1:09:07.089 --> 1:09:10.922
Now, I'm just gonna take
it one day at a time.

1:09:12.155 --> 1:09:13.722
- Mona, look at me.

1:09:15.788 --> 1:09:18.222
Mona, I just really
want to let you know

1:09:18.222 --> 1:09:20.322
that we are here for you.

1:09:22.055 --> 1:09:24.655
(somber music)

1:09:39.688 --> 1:09:41.322
- It's okay mommy, I love you.

1:09:41.322 --> 1:09:42.922
- I love you too baby.

1:09:42.922 --> 1:09:44.422
- We all love you.

1:09:46.389 --> 1:09:47.722
- You know we're here
if you need us, right.

1:09:47.722 --> 1:09:48.556
- Yes.

1:09:49.522 --> 1:09:52.189
(ominous music)

1:09:53.722 --> 1:09:57.655
- (scoffs) Look
at her over there.

1:09:57.655 --> 1:09:59.189
You think she's sorry?

1:09:59.189 --> 1:10:00.022
I don't!

1:10:03.422 --> 1:10:06.022
- Look baby, just
leave it alone.

1:10:06.022 --> 1:10:06.955
You know, it's over.

1:10:06.955 --> 1:10:08.255
Our son's gone right now.

1:10:08.255 --> 1:10:09.688
Just leave it alone.

1:10:09.688 --> 1:10:10.888
Please.

1:10:10.888 --> 1:10:13.356
- I'll be damned
if I let her profit

1:10:13.356 --> 1:10:14.522
off of my son.

1:10:16.255 --> 1:10:17.655
- Man.

1:10:17.655 --> 1:10:18.621
- I love you Mona.

1:10:18.621 --> 1:10:19.655
- I love you too.

1:10:19.655 --> 1:10:22.422
(dramatic music)

1:10:23.855 --> 1:10:26.988
- I'm here on behalf of the
hospital if you need anything,

1:10:26.988 --> 1:10:29.089
I am here for you 24/7.

1:10:29.089 --> 1:10:29.922
- Thank you.

1:10:29.922 --> 1:10:30.922
- May God bless you.

1:10:30.922 --> 1:10:33.456
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:10:33.456 --> 1:10:34.988
- It's gonna be all right.

1:10:34.988 --> 1:10:36.356
We praying for you.

1:10:36.356 --> 1:10:37.322
We love you Mona.

1:10:37.322 --> 1:10:38.255
- I love you too.

1:10:38.255 --> 1:10:39.855
- It's okay mommy, I love you.

1:10:39.855 --> 1:10:41.621
- I love you too
baby, thank you.

1:10:41.621 --> 1:10:43.722
- Ain't no sense of us
getting upset right now.

1:10:43.722 --> 1:10:45.621
You upset, I'm upset.

1:10:45.621 --> 1:10:48.621
Just leave it alone
right now, please.

1:10:48.621 --> 1:10:50.422
- Mona, I need to speak
with you for a second baby.

1:10:50.422 --> 1:10:52.255
Can you come over to the side?
- Okay.

1:10:56.122 --> 1:10:58.788
- Okay Mona, we need to get
this paperwork handled quickly.

1:10:58.788 --> 1:11:00.055
So come to my office next week

1:11:00.055 --> 1:11:01.456
so we can handle this quickly.

1:11:01.456 --> 1:11:02.289
Okay, baby?

1:11:02.289 --> 1:11:03.722
- Okay, all right.

1:11:03.722 --> 1:11:06.688
(suspenseful music)

1:11:10.089 --> 1:11:11.855
- Brown, what you think
about this case man?

1:11:11.855 --> 1:11:12.955
Something ain't right
about this case.

1:11:12.955 --> 1:11:15.589
How you feel about this case?

1:11:15.589 --> 1:11:16.621
- You right Banks.

1:11:16.621 --> 1:11:18.022
There is something strange.

1:11:18.022 --> 1:11:19.522
But you know what?

1:11:19.522 --> 1:11:21.356
You can learn a lot
by looking and seeing

1:11:21.356 --> 1:11:24.055
who can come in and
out of her house.

1:11:24.055 --> 1:11:28.589
(laughing)
(faint dialogues)

1:11:28.589 --> 1:11:30.589
- Something ain't
right about this case.

1:11:30.589 --> 1:11:32.655
- But there is something
fishy about this man.

1:11:32.655 --> 1:11:33.988
- Something very fishy.

1:11:33.988 --> 1:11:35.621
- Well we gonna find out.

1:11:35.621 --> 1:11:36.822
- Don't worry.

1:11:36.822 --> 1:11:40.055
- I think we got enough
here man, let's go.

1:11:45.822 --> 1:11:46.955
- Hey Mona.
- Hey.

1:11:46.955 --> 1:11:48.556
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

1:11:48.556 --> 1:11:50.155
- My condolences on your loss.

1:11:50.155 --> 1:11:51.356
- Thank you.

1:11:51.356 --> 1:11:52.621
- Well these are the
forms that we discussed.

1:11:52.621 --> 1:11:54.522
Tracey wanted me to
have you sign these.

1:11:54.522 --> 1:11:55.822
She'll be in, in a minute.

1:11:55.822 --> 1:11:57.089
She's on a call.

1:11:57.089 --> 1:11:58.556
But if you have any
questions or concerns,

1:11:58.556 --> 1:12:00.022
just let me know okay?

1:12:00.022 --> 1:12:00.988
- Okay.
- All right girl.

1:12:00.988 --> 1:12:01.722
- Thank you.
- See you later.

1:12:01.722 --> 1:12:02.688
- All right.

1:12:13.589 --> 1:12:15.222
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:12:15.222 --> 1:12:18.422
- Hey sweetheart, it
is so good to see you.

1:12:18.422 --> 1:12:20.422
I'm so glad that you
could make it in.

1:12:20.422 --> 1:12:21.489
- Yeah.
- So we can finally take care

1:12:21.489 --> 1:12:22.922
of this business, okay.

1:12:22.922 --> 1:12:24.155
- Mmm hmm, yeah.

1:12:24.155 --> 1:12:25.489
- I've been putting
in a lot of hours.

1:12:25.489 --> 1:12:27.255
I've gone through
all the policies

1:12:27.255 --> 1:12:28.855
and everything is set.
- Okay.

1:12:28.855 --> 1:12:30.389
- At this point, all
I need for you to do

1:12:30.389 --> 1:12:31.955
is sign the power of attorney

1:12:31.955 --> 1:12:33.155
so we can get the rest

1:12:33.155 --> 1:12:35.222
of the things wrapped
up fairy quickly.

1:12:35.222 --> 1:12:36.655
But on a personal note baby,

1:12:36.655 --> 1:12:38.255
how is Armani holding up?

1:12:38.255 --> 1:12:40.922
- (sighs) Girl, she's
having a hard time.

1:12:40.922 --> 1:12:43.055
You know, with David's family.

1:12:43.055 --> 1:12:45.422
She doesn't understand
why they're treating us

1:12:45.422 --> 1:12:46.855
the way that they are.

1:12:46.855 --> 1:12:48.955
So I don't know how to
explain it to her, you know.

1:12:48.955 --> 1:12:50.022
- They're getting on my nerves.

1:12:50.022 --> 1:12:51.255
This is ridiculous.

1:12:51.255 --> 1:12:53.988
They need to understand
that you were his wife

1:12:53.988 --> 1:12:55.389
and his sole beneficiary.

1:12:55.389 --> 1:12:56.556
End of story.

1:12:56.556 --> 1:12:57.621
End of story.

1:12:59.989 --> 1:13:01.389
- Hey Tracey.

1:13:01.389 --> 1:13:02.955
- Hey Mona, are you
done with these?

1:13:02.955 --> 1:13:04.489
- Oh yeah, I'm done.

1:13:04.489 --> 1:13:06.089
- Okay, I'll go ahead and
get them filed away for you.

1:13:06.089 --> 1:13:07.222
- Okay, thank you.

1:13:07.222 --> 1:13:08.621
- You're welcome.

1:13:10.189 --> 1:13:11.655
- Mona, everything's
gonna work out.

1:13:11.655 --> 1:13:12.989
It's gonna work out fine, okay.

1:13:12.989 --> 1:13:14.456
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:13:14.456 --> 1:13:17.055
(somber music)

1:13:18.489 --> 1:13:20.155
- Dr. Kirk.

1:13:20.155 --> 1:13:22.289
You called me today.

1:13:22.289 --> 1:13:23.988
For some reason I knew
this call would come

1:13:23.988 --> 1:13:25.556
from the hospital.

1:13:25.556 --> 1:13:27.888
What, you got something for me?

1:13:27.888 --> 1:13:31.155
- Detective, I've been
doing this a long time.

1:13:31.155 --> 1:13:35.755
So on a haunch, I had some
additional tests performed.

1:13:35.755 --> 1:13:38.122
And I just got the results back.

1:13:38.122 --> 1:13:41.621
Turns out David Jones had
arsenic in his system.

1:13:41.621 --> 1:13:42.589
- Oh.

1:13:42.589 --> 1:13:44.089
- It wasn't a lot.

1:13:44.089 --> 1:13:46.922
But it was there nonetheless.

1:13:46.922 --> 1:13:49.289
- (laughing) So
what's your opinion?

1:13:49.289 --> 1:13:50.755
- I don't have one.

1:13:50.755 --> 1:13:53.422
I'll leave that to you
and your department.

1:13:53.422 --> 1:13:55.189
I can just report what I find.

1:13:55.189 --> 1:13:56.356
- And we will.

1:13:57.255 --> 1:13:58.089
Thank you.

1:13:59.122 --> 1:14:00.522
- You're welcome.

1:14:02.155 --> 1:14:02.989
- Hello?

1:14:04.456 --> 1:14:05.556
Hi detective.

1:14:07.822 --> 1:14:10.489
I'm getting ready to leave work.

1:14:12.489 --> 1:14:15.888
Yes sir.
(ambient music)

1:14:17.089 --> 1:14:21.155
You know I can't give
you that information.

1:14:21.155 --> 1:14:24.222
You want me to lose
my job detective?

1:14:25.922 --> 1:14:27.422
No sir.

1:14:27.422 --> 1:14:29.489
Just like you have your
job, I want to keep mine.

1:14:29.489 --> 1:14:32.589
(ambient music)

1:14:32.589 --> 1:14:35.422
Yes sir, you have a good night.

1:14:35.422 --> 1:14:36.255
Bye.

1:14:36.255 --> 1:14:38.922
(ambient music)

1:14:43.589 --> 1:14:48.589
(ambient music)
(engine revs)

1:14:49.322 --> 1:14:52.155
(phone rings)

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:54.289
- Law offices, how
may I help you?

1:14:54.289 --> 1:14:56.189
- [Barry] Okay my
name's Barry Clark

1:14:56.189 --> 1:14:58.222
from Agency Insurance Company.

1:14:58.222 --> 1:14:59.622
I'm calling for attorney Jones.

1:14:59.622 --> 1:15:01.122
- Okay Mr. Clark, I apologize,

1:15:01.122 --> 1:15:03.322
she's in a meeting at this time.

1:15:03.322 --> 1:15:04.822
- [Barry] Okay um.

1:15:05.955 --> 1:15:07.222
I will definitely
need to speak to her.

1:15:07.222 --> 1:15:08.688
Actually I'm calling
just to let her know

1:15:08.688 --> 1:15:10.389
that we're not gonna be
able to release those funds

1:15:10.389 --> 1:15:11.988
at this time.

1:15:11.988 --> 1:15:15.955
- Okay, but what does this
have to do with our case?

1:15:15.955 --> 1:15:18.855
- [Barry] We can
discuss that in privacy.

1:15:18.855 --> 1:15:20.655
But just let her
know that we will not

1:15:20.655 --> 1:15:22.788
be able to release those
funds at this time.

1:15:22.788 --> 1:15:24.489
- Okay, I'll be
happy to let her know

1:15:24.489 --> 1:15:26.489
and have her give
you a call okay?

1:15:26.489 --> 1:15:29.655
(rhythmic music)

1:15:29.655 --> 1:15:31.522
- [Detective Banks] Brown.

1:15:31.522 --> 1:15:33.322
- What's up man?
- What you doing this weekend?

1:15:33.322 --> 1:15:35.389
You wanna go fishing with me?

1:15:35.389 --> 1:15:37.456
- Man you been asking me about
fishing for the longest man.

1:15:37.456 --> 1:15:38.988
Look, let's go
fishing this weekend.

1:15:38.988 --> 1:15:40.456
Let's make it a deal.

1:15:40.456 --> 1:15:44.289
- [Detective Banks] All
right, bet. (phone ringing)

1:15:44.289 --> 1:15:46.622
- Detective Brown, homicide.

1:15:52.289 --> 1:15:53.122
Really?

1:15:55.722 --> 1:15:56.556
You sure?

1:16:00.988 --> 1:16:02.122
Thank you.

1:16:02.122 --> 1:16:03.622
Thank you so much.

1:16:06.389 --> 1:16:08.189
Man you won't believe,
I just got a tip.

1:16:08.189 --> 1:16:09.122
- [Detective Banks] From who?

1:16:09.122 --> 1:16:10.589
- From an insurance company.

1:16:10.589 --> 1:16:11.456
- [Detective Banks]
Think it got something

1:16:11.456 --> 1:16:12.822
to do with the case?

1:16:12.822 --> 1:16:14.589
- Hell yeah, it has something
to do with the case.

1:16:14.589 --> 1:16:15.522
Man we got work to do.

1:16:15.522 --> 1:16:16.356
Let's go.

1:16:17.955 --> 1:16:20.722
(dramatic music)

1:16:31.622 --> 1:16:32.888
(sighs)

1:16:32.888 --> 1:16:35.622
(dramatic music)

1:16:43.556 --> 1:16:45.422
- Senior and junior?

1:16:45.422 --> 1:16:48.189
(dramatic music)

1:16:50.289 --> 1:16:51.556
What kind of stuff is this?

1:16:51.556 --> 1:16:52.955
I guess my wife did this here.

1:16:52.955 --> 1:16:55.688
(dramatic music)

1:16:57.055 --> 1:16:57.955
What?

1:16:57.955 --> 1:17:00.722
(dramatic music)

1:17:03.688 --> 1:17:05.022
(gun bangs)

1:17:05.022 --> 1:17:07.755
(dramatic music)

1:17:38.022 --> 1:17:39.255
- What we got Banks?

1:17:39.255 --> 1:17:40.722
- Looks like we got a
cold blooded murder.

1:17:40.722 --> 1:17:43.722
(suspenseful music)

1:17:47.255 --> 1:17:50.922
- Looks like he was
shot point blank range.

1:17:50.922 --> 1:17:52.155
No robbery.

1:17:52.155 --> 1:17:53.755
Don't appear to be
no kind of robbery.

1:17:53.755 --> 1:17:54.888
- [Detective Brown] No robbery?

1:17:54.888 --> 1:17:55.822
- Still got everything
in his pocket.

1:17:55.822 --> 1:17:58.356
Got his wallet, got his keys.

1:17:58.356 --> 1:17:59.755
- Looks like he's a married man.

1:17:59.755 --> 1:18:00.988
Where's his wife?

1:18:00.988 --> 1:18:02.855
- [Detective Banks] No
one's seen his wife yet.

1:18:02.855 --> 1:18:04.422
We haven't located her.

1:18:04.422 --> 1:18:05.755
- Is that right?

1:18:07.655 --> 1:18:10.556
(papers shuffling)

1:18:15.755 --> 1:18:18.589
(camera flickers)

1:18:23.022 --> 1:18:25.755
- This wasn't no robbery.

1:18:25.755 --> 1:18:26.589
Hold up.

1:18:32.556 --> 1:18:34.389
We got what we need right here.

1:18:34.389 --> 1:18:35.222
(dramatic music)

1:18:35.222 --> 1:18:36.522
Let's go man.

1:18:36.522 --> 1:18:37.556
Take care of that.

1:18:37.556 --> 1:18:40.322
(dramatic music)

1:18:41.489 --> 1:18:43.788
(camera flickers)

1:18:43.788 --> 1:18:46.389
(siren alarms)

1:18:48.389 --> 1:18:51.389
(suspenseful music)

1:19:46.989 --> 1:19:47.988
- Damn girl.

1:19:47.988 --> 1:19:49.989
This is David's old car.

1:19:53.055 --> 1:19:54.589
Oh okay.

1:19:54.589 --> 1:19:55.422
Bye.

1:20:00.788 --> 1:20:01.722
- Hey.

1:20:01.722 --> 1:20:03.022
- Hey, how you doing?

1:20:03.022 --> 1:20:04.122
- All right.

1:20:04.122 --> 1:20:05.356
- Are you David's mom?
- Yes I am.

1:20:05.356 --> 1:20:07.556
- Hey I'm just up here
checking up on Mona.

1:20:07.556 --> 1:20:09.222
- Really, me too.

1:20:09.222 --> 1:20:12.489
(woman screaming)
(dramatic music)

1:20:12.489 --> 1:20:15.988
(loud slashing)
(dramatic music)

1:20:15.988 --> 1:20:18.655
(ominous music)

1:20:35.822 --> 1:20:37.055
- Mama mama!

1:20:37.055 --> 1:20:38.255
I heard somebody
screaming outside.

1:20:38.255 --> 1:20:39.089
- What?

1:20:39.089 --> 1:20:39.922
Go to your room.

1:20:39.922 --> 1:20:42.589
(ominous music)

1:21:07.289 --> 1:21:09.888
(dramatic music)

1:21:09.888 --> 1:21:11.522
(woman screaming)

1:21:11.522 --> 1:21:14.655
(labored breathing)

1:21:14.655 --> 1:21:15.622
(woman screaming)

1:21:15.622 --> 1:21:17.222
- You stupid bitch.

1:21:18.589 --> 1:21:21.389
You ruined everything for me.

1:21:21.389 --> 1:21:22.389
I had plans.

1:21:23.589 --> 1:21:26.489
And do you think they
meant something to me?

1:21:26.489 --> 1:21:28.356
(laughing) No they didn't.

1:21:28.356 --> 1:21:29.922
And neither do you.

1:21:30.788 --> 1:21:31.755
- No.

1:21:31.755 --> 1:21:33.322
No, no!

1:21:33.322 --> 1:21:34.155
- Drop it!

1:21:34.155 --> 1:21:36.489
(gun bangs)

1:21:39.356 --> 1:21:40.788
- You okay?

1:21:40.788 --> 1:21:42.356
- Yeah.

1:21:42.356 --> 1:21:43.456
- She killed your husband.

1:21:43.456 --> 1:21:44.655
- What?

1:21:44.655 --> 1:21:46.122
- Yeah and also
your friend outside.

1:21:46.122 --> 1:21:49.255
- Oh my God. (sobbing)

1:21:49.255 --> 1:21:50.489
- It's over, it's over now.

1:21:50.489 --> 1:21:52.022
(sobbing)

1:21:52.022 --> 1:21:54.622
Mona, I'm here to take you out.

1:21:54.622 --> 1:21:57.222
Let's go.
- Oh my God.

1:21:57.222 --> 1:22:02.189
(chanting)
(dramatic music)

1:22:02.822 --> 1:22:05.122
(dramatic music)

1:22:09.888 --> 1:22:12.722
- Local police have reported
that a double homicide

1:22:12.722 --> 1:22:16.955
linked to another murder has
occurred at this residence.

1:22:16.955 --> 1:22:20.589
The motive is still
unclear at this moment.

1:22:20.589 --> 1:22:22.556
- (sighs) Oh my God.

1:22:22.556 --> 1:22:23.422
Where's my baby?

1:22:23.422 --> 1:22:24.788
- Oh my God.

1:22:24.788 --> 1:22:27.556
(dramatic music)

1:22:29.988 --> 1:22:34.988
(rhythmic music)
(native singing)

1:22:54.356 --> 1:22:57.122
(rhythmic music)

1:23:21.422 --> 1:23:23.289
- Because when we
make our jingles,

1:23:23.289 --> 1:23:26.189
our jingles become
singles. (laughing)

1:23:26.189 --> 1:23:28.556
- [Mona Voiceover] My
first husband John.

1:23:28.556 --> 1:23:31.556
This was the first man
I ever truly loved.

1:23:31.556 --> 1:23:32.955
The man of my dreams.

1:23:32.955 --> 1:23:34.322
Truly.

1:23:34.322 --> 1:23:35.988
He gave me my Armani.

1:23:35.988 --> 1:23:38.989
And I guess he'll
always be with me.

1:23:41.822 --> 1:23:42.755
David, hmm.

1:23:43.855 --> 1:23:45.988
David was a good man.

1:23:45.988 --> 1:23:49.189
But I always knew he
was a momma's boy.

1:23:49.189 --> 1:23:51.189
(laughing) Too bad
his momma didn't feel

1:23:51.189 --> 1:23:52.855
the same way about him.

1:23:52.855 --> 1:23:54.389
- [David] I just stopped
by for a hot second okay.

1:23:54.389 --> 1:23:55.888
- Oh really, okay.

1:23:55.888 --> 1:23:58.556
Well look, you
need to leave her.

1:23:58.556 --> 1:24:01.456
(reflective music)

1:24:03.888 --> 1:24:08.022
- [Mona Voiceover] Dawn,
what can I say about Dawn?

1:24:08.022 --> 1:24:12.155
She was my friend and I
loved her zest for life.

1:24:12.155 --> 1:24:16.022
She left town after she
broke up with Vince.

1:24:16.022 --> 1:24:18.389
Found out he was
cheating I guess.

1:24:18.389 --> 1:24:20.589
I don't know where she is now.

1:24:20.589 --> 1:24:23.255
Probably chasing some other man.

1:24:24.822 --> 1:24:27.055
- Come on lady, tell me
what's going on with you okay?

1:24:27.055 --> 1:24:28.922
- [Mona Voiceover] Tracey.

1:24:28.922 --> 1:24:32.189
She's like the big
sister I never had.

1:24:32.189 --> 1:24:35.556
I knew I could always count
on her to look out for me.

1:24:35.556 --> 1:24:37.522
- Lord Jesus, just the
coming of a new day.

1:24:37.522 --> 1:24:40.155
- [Mona Voiceover]
Aunt Bee. (laughing)

1:24:40.155 --> 1:24:43.522
I should have listened to
you in the first place.

1:24:43.522 --> 1:24:45.622
- Well I'm sure ma will be okay.

1:24:45.622 --> 1:24:49.222
- [Mona Voiceover]
Armani, my baby.

1:24:49.222 --> 1:24:51.888
That's the real love of my life.

1:24:54.788 --> 1:24:56.855
Well, I'm gonna relocate.

1:24:58.055 --> 1:25:00.722
I just want to live
and be happy again.

1:25:00.722 --> 1:25:01.922
No more drama.
