WEBVTT

00:03.370 --> 00:06.706
Mommy, can you please draw a
picture of a Christmas tree?

00:06.773 --> 00:09.409
Christmas tree? It's, like,
ten months 'til Christmas.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.644
I know. I just want
to see you draw it.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.146
Okay.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.481
There we go.

00:14.547 --> 00:19.986
Uh, this is my Christmas tree,
do a little star at the top.

00:20.053 --> 00:24.357
Now can you write, "You make
the best cookies. Love, Santa."

00:24.424 --> 00:26.359
That seems like kind of a weird
thing to want me to write,

00:26.426 --> 00:27.827
but, okay, what is it?

00:27.894 --> 00:34.000
"You make the best
cookies, love..."

00:34.067 --> 00:36.302
Santa.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.302
"Santa."

00:36.369 --> 00:39.406
There you go.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.107
Now write it like
you're in a hurry.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.243
Like I'm in a hurry?

00:43.309 --> 00:46.613
Okay, uh,
"You make the best

00:46.679 --> 00:50.884
cookies. Love, Santa,"
I gotta go!

00:50.950 --> 00:52.285
All right.
It's not you.

00:52.352 --> 00:55.088
Honey, why would you think
that mommy was Santa Claus?

00:55.155 --> 00:56.456
Yeah, come on.

00:56.523 --> 01:00.160
Opal's brother said Santa
was really just parents.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.528
What?

01:01.594 --> 01:05.031
You think I have nothing better
to do than stay up late and,

01:05.098 --> 01:07.600
and fill stockings
and wrap presents?

01:07.667 --> 01:10.236
What do I like to do more than
anything else in the world?

01:10.303 --> 01:11.371
Sleep.

01:11.438 --> 01:12.872
You do like to sleep.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.707
I knew it wasn't you.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.712
[whispering]
Hey, you know what?

01:19.779 --> 01:22.182
Fuck you--
I am Santa.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.450
It's me.

01:23.516 --> 01:25.118
[singing whisper]
♪ I do you presents ♪

01:25.185 --> 01:27.787
♪ I fill your stockings ♪

01:27.854 --> 01:29.355
That felt good.

01:29.422 --> 01:34.294
♪

01:46.372 --> 01:48.241
And what side would you like
with your sandwich?

01:48.308 --> 01:49.876
What are my choices?

01:49.943 --> 01:52.679
We have French fries,
salad, rice... [sniffling]

01:52.745 --> 01:54.481
and for an extra dollar
you can have fruit.

01:54.547 --> 01:55.682
Okay, I'll have salad.

01:55.748 --> 01:58.051
Okay. What kind of dressing
would you like?

01:58.117 --> 02:00.787
We have Ranch,
Thousand Island, balsamic.

02:00.854 --> 02:01.955
You know what,
I'm just gonna have rice.

02:02.021 --> 02:03.556
Rice sounds great.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.791
Okay, I'll put that right in.
Thank you.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.260
Thank you so much.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.260
Yummy.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.795
[whispering]
Is she okay?

02:08.862 --> 02:10.930
I mean, she's, like,
fully about to cry, right?

02:10.997 --> 02:13.166
Ooh. I feel terrible.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.166
Yeah.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.400
All right.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.135
Where are we on Bumbling?
Are we Tindering?

02:16.202 --> 02:18.371
Are we-- is it happening?

02:16.202 --> 02:18.371
I hate it.

02:18.438 --> 02:20.306
I just can't.
The whole internet dating thing.

02:20.373 --> 02:21.541
Come on.

02:20.373 --> 02:21.541
It's "What do you do?

02:21.608 --> 02:22.976
"What do I do?
Are you a serial killer?

02:23.042 --> 02:24.544
I'm not one."

02:24.611 --> 02:26.946
I got, like, two kids.
I don't have time for it.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.982
I just need to find a Mike,
is what I need to find.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.718
No... [mumbling]
No, no, no, I mean, yeah,

02:31.784 --> 02:32.986
eventually, sure,
that's the dream.

02:33.052 --> 02:35.788
But right now, you need to
enjoy yourself, okay?

02:35.855 --> 02:37.156
This isn't gonna
last forever.

02:37.223 --> 02:41.160
Right now you need to be
knee-deep in dick.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.263
What does that mean?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.565
Well, when I first said it,
I was visualizing, like,

02:45.632 --> 02:47.967
vertical dicks
as high as your knee.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.136
Like a field of dicks?

02:48.034 --> 02:50.136
A field of dicks,

02:50.203 --> 02:52.338
but now I'm just going more of,
like, a horizontal one

02:52.405 --> 02:55.408
flopped over the next,
like a penis lasagna.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.510
Yummy.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.510
Or parfait.

02:57.577 --> 02:59.913
I'm so sorry, we are
all out of turkey burgers.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.414
Can I get you
something else?

03:01.481 --> 03:03.583
Oh, yeah,
that's totally fine.

03:03.650 --> 03:07.420
Umm, uh, is there--
should I look at the menu?

03:07.487 --> 03:10.423
Uh, yeah, I can--

03:07.487 --> 03:10.423
Oh, no, God, uh,

03:10.490 --> 03:12.225
that's, uh, I don't
even need a menu.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.260
Whatever she has--

03:12.292 --> 03:14.260
I'll have the same as
what she's ordering.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.763
You know what-- okay.
Any, any sandwich.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.765
Her sandwich is great.
Thank you.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.067
Okay. Um, what side
would you like?

03:21.134 --> 03:24.337
We have French fries,
salad, rice.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.440
Rice, the rice, I'll definite--
rice sounds great.

03:27.507 --> 03:28.908
Thank you.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.176
Okay, something
is definitely going on.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.145
Should we ask her
if she's okay?

03:32.211 --> 03:33.346
What--
do you know her?

03:33.413 --> 03:35.415
No, but she's upset.
She's looking for

03:35.481 --> 03:36.416
some sort of human--

03:36.482 --> 03:37.984
She does not want to
talk about it.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.320
Okay, you know what,
let's get back to you...

03:40.386 --> 03:41.854
[singing]
♪ Livin' the life ♪

03:41.921 --> 03:43.656
♪ That dreams were made of ♪

03:43.723 --> 03:45.692
Why are you so excited
about me dating?

03:45.758 --> 03:47.126
Because you can.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.662
And now I get to live
vicariously through you.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.863
All right, want me
to be honest with you?

03:50.930 --> 03:52.832
Yes.
Please, finally.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.335
I have a very detailed fantasy
about being a divorcee.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.469
And I know
I'm happily married

03:56.536 --> 03:57.971
so it's probably
never gonna happen,

03:58.037 --> 04:00.940
but I would kill it
out there.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.610
I just feel like
it's who I was meant to be.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.044
A divorcee.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.044
Yes!

04:05.111 --> 04:07.513
Who says "divorcee"?

04:05.111 --> 04:07.513
Who? Me, I do.

04:07.580 --> 04:11.918
It's just like a sultry moniker
from a bygone era, you know?

04:11.985 --> 04:14.053
Like a divorcee--

04:14.120 --> 04:17.924
she's not afraid to storm
into a bank and demand a loan

04:17.991 --> 04:19.792
for her small business.

04:19.859 --> 04:22.595
She walks in a room and women
grab their husbands and, like,

04:22.662 --> 04:24.864
"Don't talk to her,
she's a divorcee."

04:24.931 --> 04:26.065
Hmm.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.065
And then they just wanna

04:26.132 --> 04:27.967
talk to me more.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.967
Even more.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.636
Yeah, yeah,
'cause it's forbidden.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.105
I gotta say, I feel like you
have a really inaccurate picture

04:32.171 --> 04:33.973
of what it means to be
a divorcee, though.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.642
No, I feel like I have
a pretty good understanding.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.977
Here's your...
tuna sandwiches,

04:38.044 --> 04:41.814
with rice, um, can I get you
anything else? [sniffles]

04:41.881 --> 04:43.449
You know what,
I'm sorry, I don't mean to

04:43.516 --> 04:46.719
pry, but are you okay?
We feel like there--

04:46.786 --> 04:48.721
that maybe you're
having a rough time.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.223
If there's anything
we can do.

04:50.289 --> 04:53.159
Um, I'd really rather
not talk about it.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.395
Can I get you some water?

04:55.461 --> 04:57.296
No, I think we're good.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.296
Thank you.

04:57.363 --> 05:00.833
No, thank you, thanks.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.569
That's a divorcee.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.071
All right, dad,
where's the rest of my stuff?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.239
What else do you
need me to take?

05:06.305 --> 05:08.307
Oh, I think
that's good enough.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.009
Seriously?
This one box?

05:10.076 --> 05:12.545
You said my stuff
was taking over your garage.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.081
You used the word
"overwhelmed".

05:15.148 --> 05:16.416
Well, it was in the way.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.218
As opposed to the three
birdcages for the bird

05:19.285 --> 05:20.553
you've never purchased?

05:20.620 --> 05:22.555
Those were always
supposed to be decorative.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.591
Yeah, they really give
an air of whimsy to your garage.

05:25.658 --> 05:29.028
As does those super necessary
collection of fedoras.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.196
Don't touch those hats.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.432
I wasn't planning on
touching those.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.067
I'm saving them for
my New Year's Eve party--

05:34.133 --> 05:35.435
the theme is Prohibition.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.604
By the way, I went clubbing
with Bonnie last night.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.740
I think you and Mike
would really like this place.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.909
Bonnie's daughter
Stephanie dances there.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.378
I'm gonna take
this in pieces.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.280
You and Bonnie went
clubbing yesterday?

05:47.346 --> 05:48.848
Yeah.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.848
Dad...

05:48.915 --> 05:51.050
I don't think you mean clubbing.
You went to a bar?

05:51.117 --> 05:52.051
No, it was a club,
a dance club.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.519
Like, for elderly people?

05:53.586 --> 05:57.523
No, it's, it's a club
called Xscape, with an "X".

05:57.590 --> 06:00.760
What? Oh, God, okay, was that,
and that was fun for you?

06:00.827 --> 06:03.396
Yes. L.A. has some of
the best clubs of anywhere

06:03.463 --> 06:06.165
in the country, I mean, that
and all the weed dispensaries.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.600
Have you heard about edibles?

06:07.667 --> 06:09.769
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow!

06:09.836 --> 06:13.039
You, you partaking?

06:09.836 --> 06:13.039
Bonnie and I like to party.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.741
Super cool, super cool.

06:14.807 --> 06:18.277
Okay, okay, well, it sounds
like you guys are really, uh,

06:18.344 --> 06:19.979
exploring a whole new world.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.547
Okay, good for you.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.547
Yep.

06:21.614 --> 06:24.751
And you said Bonnie's daughter
dances at Xscape with an "X"?

06:24.817 --> 06:27.053
Yes, she does.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.856
I hesitate to ask this, but...

06:29.922 --> 06:32.725
Does she wear a top?

06:29.922 --> 06:32.725
Oh, for Christ's sake.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.393
Okay! I didn't know!

06:34.460 --> 06:36.362
She wears a little,
like a bra thing

06:36.429 --> 06:38.631
and there's kind of like
a bootie shorts--

06:38.698 --> 06:40.299
gorgeous thing.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.299
Oh, Jesus!

06:40.366 --> 06:43.369
Oh, please, dad, never,
ever say "bootie short"

06:43.436 --> 06:47.807
or gesture in this way
in any capacity again.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.809
You will meet Stephanie
at my birthday party.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.477
Great. I look
forward to that.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.045
And by the way,
speaking of your party,

06:53.112 --> 06:54.580
you need to give me
the invite list.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.415
I want to get the invites out
this weekend.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.151
What do you have planned
for my birthday?

06:58.217 --> 07:00.853
I don't know,
I'm exploring some options.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.789
Hmm.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.789
Dad, maybe you could slip into

07:02.855 --> 07:06.225
one of these super cool leather
jackets for your birthday.

07:06.292 --> 07:09.328
You seem to have a very
extensive collection.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.631
If you want any of those,
please, help yourself.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.967
Oh, there we go.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.570
I cha-cha-cha,
da-lata-ta, ooh-da.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.071
Is that a tell?

07:17.637 --> 07:19.071
Come on.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.273
You're a terrible bluffer.

07:20.339 --> 07:21.374
Yeah, come on.

07:20.339 --> 07:21.374
That's a terrible bluff!

07:21.440 --> 07:23.309
Really? I think
it was the best bluff ever.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.877
Ooh, guys,

07:24.944 --> 07:26.245
it's official.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.414
My friend Jennifer
is on Bumble

07:28.481 --> 07:32.018
and open for biz!

07:28.481 --> 07:32.018
Hey, I'm on Bumble.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.052
What's your friend's
last name?

07:33.119 --> 07:34.253
No offense, Gavin,

07:34.320 --> 07:36.889
but you clearly
have herpes on your head.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.359
I just-- I don't actually
feel comfortable--

07:40.426 --> 07:41.928
It was a surfing accident.

07:41.994 --> 07:42.929
You said you couldn't
even notice it.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.263
Yeah, you can't.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.898
It's hardly noticeable.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.898
He's lying to you.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.068
It's... very noticeable,
and honestly, hard to look at.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.171
Also, I'm not gonna set you up
with a living, breathing saint,

07:52.238 --> 07:54.407
so go fuck yourself.

07:54.473 --> 07:55.875
Whoa.

07:54.473 --> 07:55.875
It's okay, she's right.

07:55.942 --> 07:57.610
I have been meaning to go
fuck myself.

07:57.677 --> 07:58.845
See?

07:57.677 --> 07:58.845
Wow.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.680
By the way, he is delightful.

08:00.746 --> 08:02.315
Why did you say
he was gonna be terrible?

08:02.381 --> 08:04.116
I never said that.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.116
I can't work with you anymore.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.418
Um, let me ask you
a question.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.320
How long was your friend
married for?

08:05.484 --> 08:07.320
Nine years.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.088
Which sucks for her,
because had she made it

08:09.155 --> 08:11.023
to the ten year mark,
then she could've gotten alimony

08:11.090 --> 08:12.525
until she remarries.

08:12.592 --> 08:15.361
Now she's only getting it for
half the length of the marriage,

08:15.428 --> 08:16.829
which, you know, 'cause it's
California, in other states

08:16.896 --> 08:18.130
they're slightly different.

08:18.197 --> 08:20.533
Um, you seem to know
an awful lot lot about divorce.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.768
Honey, you know I have a fantasy
about being a divorcee.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.203
Yeah. I don't love that
about you.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.340
Uh, can we lose the leather now?
I mean, it's a little...

08:27.406 --> 08:29.475
No!

08:27.406 --> 08:29.475
...snug and smells like

08:29.542 --> 08:31.777
Cool Water in there.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.777
You look like a marionette.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.779
A good marionette, not like
one of the creepy ones.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.947
I would disagree.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.682
I think you look like
a creepy marionette,

08:36.749 --> 08:38.451
but I find that
very attractive.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.019
I'll take it.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.221
I love my jacket, and I can't
wait to wear it out to a club.

08:42.288 --> 08:44.390
Great-- you know what, you
should go to Xscape with an "X".

08:44.457 --> 08:46.292
That's the club
my 70-year-old father

08:46.359 --> 08:48.728
and his allergist girlfriend
are frequenting these days.

08:48.794 --> 08:49.962
That sounds amazing.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.464
No, no, it's a new
development.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.900
He's only newly amazing.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.900
That's sounds awesome.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.735
My dad is turning
into a recluse.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.904
Oh, that sounds adorable.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.305
But your dad seems
cool as hell.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.373
You know what, you want my dad,
you can have him.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.074
Then you can plan
his 70th birthday.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.476
Well, you should do it
in a club.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.311
I'm not encouraging
this behavior of my dad's.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.213
No, come on, you should.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.748
I mean, what do you care?
He'd probably love it.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.983
Ugh, he probably would
love it, I don't know.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.487
I'm like, I... I mean, I guess
I could lean into it and, what,

09:14.553 --> 09:16.322
look into something like
a burlesque club or something?

09:16.389 --> 09:17.490
Ooh, yes.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.490
Yes!

09:17.556 --> 09:18.824
So now I gotta watch
women take their clothes off

09:18.891 --> 09:20.493
while celebrating
your dad's birth?

09:20.559 --> 09:21.594
Come on, first of all,
you're making it sound like

09:21.661 --> 09:22.728
a strip club.

09:22.795 --> 09:25.064
This is more like
old-timey whores,

09:25.131 --> 09:26.832
like in a saloon.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.467
I like old timey whores.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.503
Ooh-- I'm leaving you
for Gavin.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.503
Great.

09:36.208 --> 09:39.145
Why is he still needing help
to get to the bathroom?

09:39.211 --> 09:40.780
Isn't he blind?

09:39.211 --> 09:40.780
I know, I'm just saying

09:40.846 --> 09:42.248
he's here all the time

09:42.315 --> 09:44.750
and he's always asking people
to lead him to the bathroom.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.452
I led him to the bathroom.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.452
So what?

09:46.519 --> 09:48.354
So isn't that one of
the perks of being blind,

09:48.421 --> 09:50.856
like your other senses step up
and then it's easier for you

09:50.923 --> 09:52.992
to learn the lay of the land?

09:53.059 --> 09:55.194
Are you serious, a perk?
That's a perk of being blind?

09:55.261 --> 09:57.296
Actually, it is a perk.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.296
That term is not--
[phone vibrating]

09:57.363 --> 09:59.865
Dealing with it, that is
one of the upsides, I would say.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.535
What's wrong?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.535
This guy just texted me
on Bumble.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.371
Ooh, let me see,
let me see, let me see.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.706
"Hi, Jennifer,
how's it going?

10:06.772 --> 10:08.674
"I'm in town from Chicago
for a few days.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.376
Would you want
to grab a drink?"

10:10.443 --> 10:11.811
Yah, yah, you do want
to grab a drink.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.512
No, I don't.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.512
How do I respond?

10:13.579 --> 10:15.948
He doesn't even live here, and
he's only here for a few days.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.050
Exactly, that's what
we're looking for.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.458
Just a powerful
musical diversion.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.660
I'm like the Lin Manuel Miranda
of fuck songs.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.363
Okay, listen, let's write back
something like,

10:30.429 --> 10:32.231
"Do you need
a place to stay?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.632
"I've got an extra room,

10:33.699 --> 10:36.569
Oh, my God.

10:36.635 --> 10:37.737
No!

10:36.635 --> 10:37.737
It's a joke.

10:37.803 --> 10:38.804
I can't--

on these sites, okay?

Do you know how hard it is
to know that I have a gift

10:45.144 --> 10:47.413
that I'm never gonna be able
to share with the world?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.914
This didn't exist
when I was single.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.484
Mm-hmm.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.484
Oh, he is cute, though.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.720
I could see myself with him.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.720
You're married, though, so...

10:54.787 --> 10:57.490
Yeah, happily, that's
my cross to bear, okay?

10:57.556 --> 11:00.159
Just let me have
this one thing?

11:00.226 --> 11:01.327
Sorry, go ahead.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.929
Ooh, he likes trying
new foods.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.766
You know what, Erin,
I'll try new foods with you...

11:06.832 --> 11:08.300
all over your body!

11:08.367 --> 11:11.170
I mean, nothing spicy
or dairy, although, ooh,

11:11.237 --> 11:13.939
I'd throw back a couple
of Lactaids for this guy.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.474
I find it really interesting

11:15.541 --> 11:17.843
that in your fantasies you're
still lactose intolerant.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.678
Well, I just like to be
responsible

11:19.745 --> 11:21.680
even in my fantasies.

11:21.747 --> 11:22.948
Who else do you got in here?

11:23.015 --> 11:24.950
I don't know,
just a bunch of dudes.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.519
What age did you put
in here?

11:26.585 --> 11:29.422
Forty-five to 70.

11:26.585 --> 11:29.422
Forty-five to 70?

11:29.488 --> 11:32.658
I know, like, to a 70-year-old,
then I'm gonna be,

11:32.725 --> 11:34.326
like, you know...

11:32.725 --> 11:34.326
Yeah?

11:34.393 --> 11:36.762
Ha-cha-cha.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.762
You could be a cha-cha-cha to,

11:36.829 --> 11:38.297
like, a 50-year-old.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.167
This is what, this is what
you're looking for, Brad?

11:41.233 --> 11:42.802
He's on the older end.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.802
Yeah.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.005
I'm just-- I'm looking for,
like, a long-term relationship.

11:46.072 --> 11:49.341
He's not gonna be around that
long, so, not the route to go.

11:49.408 --> 11:50.743
I understand what
you're saying, but, like,

11:50.810 --> 11:52.445
what am I gonna do with,
like, a 25-year-old?

11:52.511 --> 11:53.879
Have sex with him.

11:53.946 --> 11:55.681
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I could
have sex with a 25-year-old.

11:55.748 --> 11:56.882
Wait, I was joking.

11:56.949 --> 11:58.617
Do you really think we could
have sex with a 25--

11:58.684 --> 12:00.419
Let's do-- that's the plan.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.419
What is "we"?

12:00.486 --> 12:02.455
What is "we"?

12:00.486 --> 12:02.455
I'm having sex through you.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.190
Such a weird thing to say,

12:04.256 --> 12:06.292
like, a really weird
thing to say.

12:06.358 --> 12:09.128
No... but I love it so much.

12:06.358 --> 12:09.128
I don't think--

12:09.195 --> 12:10.463
I'm so glad that you're happy.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.798
I feel like I'm not
ready to date yet.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.767
I tried, I just, I can't,
I'm not ready.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.001
Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.803
Let's take men
out of the equation.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.272
You still need to go out
and have some fun

12:20.339 --> 12:21.640
like a single person would.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.076
I'm not going to a club.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.076
No, you're not my father.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.646
But, can we just go, like,
to a fun, trendy bar?

12:27.713 --> 12:29.648
Okay, fine.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.151
We can go to a bar,
but I'm not washing my hair.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.419
Hmm?

12:32.218 --> 12:33.419
It's off my hair cycle.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.221
I'm not washing my hair.
You need a cycle.

12:35.287 --> 12:39.492
Oh, my God, look--
seriously? Again?

12:39.558 --> 12:41.160
Did he just get side boob?

12:41.227 --> 12:43.796
Oh, my God,
he just got side boobs.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.265
I can't handle you right now.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.265
You didn't see his hand?

12:46.332 --> 12:47.666

No.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.370

12:58.711 --> 13:00.546
I got a specialty drink
named after him--

13:00.613 --> 13:02.181
the Martinini.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.083
It's not my best.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.083
It's not your worst.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.418
How dare you?

13:06.485 --> 13:09.655
I do still think it's weird
that this is now dad's life,

13:09.722 --> 13:12.658
that he's drinking,
doing drugs, going to clubs.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.260
Well, you know,
he's recently divorced,

13:14.326 --> 13:16.095
and that's one of the upsides,
you can do whatever you want.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.097
That's what I say.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.499
Mom, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.535
I have a little fantasy
about being a divorcee.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.837
Me too!

13:22.601 --> 13:24.837
You've been one twice!

13:24.904 --> 13:26.572
Both times you jumped
right back into marriage.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.740
I know, I never
did it right,

13:27.806 --> 13:29.608
so I fantasize about
the next one.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.277
"The next one"?

13:31.343 --> 13:32.678
Don't you think you're
gonna be more of, like,

13:32.745 --> 13:34.747
a widow that time,
less of a divorcee?

13:34.813 --> 13:38.017
Yeah, but isn't that
the dream scenario?

13:38.083 --> 13:39.952
I also have thought
that, right?

13:40.019 --> 13:41.220
Right, I mean,
it ups the sympathy,

13:41.287 --> 13:42.621
it cuts down on a lot
of the paperwork.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.790
And there's, like, a clean
break, there's no guilt.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.300
Dad RSVP'd no
to his own party.

13:54.366 --> 13:56.035
Why do I let him near
technology?

13:56.101 --> 13:57.203

I'm only dating men

13:57.269 --> 13:58.571
who are good at technology.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.072
Yeah, well, that's gonna be
tough in your age group, mom.

14:00.139 --> 14:03.209
You might want to just aim
for good breath.

14:03.275 --> 14:04.610
Yeah, that's a good one.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.378

You RSVP'd no
to your party.

14:12.785 --> 14:13.919

Year's party for some time now,

14:18.624 --> 14:21.560

<i>my party was going back in time</i>

14:21.627 --> 14:23.629
<i>to a time of cocktails--</i>

14:23.696 --> 14:27.032
an era of more thought towards
dress and fun in a past era.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.401
Ah, right, right,
one of those classic parties.

14:29.468 --> 14:33.572
And while I appreciate your
efforts, I'm a little bit upset

14:33.639 --> 14:36.408
that your premise and invite
steals some of the thunder

14:36.475 --> 14:38.344
and excitement
from my event.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.080
What? I, I am so confused
right now.

14:41.146 --> 14:43.515
What, what exactly
is happening right now?

14:43.582 --> 14:46.986
Well, my party theme was
the Roaring '20s.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.021
You copied it!

14:47.052 --> 14:49.021
First of all, dad,

14:49.088 --> 14:52.224
you said that your theme
was Prohibition,

14:52.291 --> 14:54.159
and also,
my party is not '20s.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.161
You called it
"The Great Grandsby".

14:56.228 --> 14:58.831
I was trying to give it a cutesy
name to disguise the fact

14:58.897 --> 15:01.333
that it's a bunch of old people
heading out to a club.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.736
There was a flapper
on the invite.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.604
'Cause she was dancing,

15:05.671 --> 15:07.940
and apparently
that's your new hobby.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.576
Dad, I was trying to
throw you a party, okay?

15:10.643 --> 15:12.244
Not insult you.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.013
Well, between the two
things, honey--

15:14.079 --> 15:15.180
All right,
you know what, dad?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.449
Assuming that this
was a legitimate beef,

15:17.516 --> 15:19.351
which, by the way,
is insane,

15:19.418 --> 15:21.687
<i>this is the way</i>
<i>you chose to go about it,</i>

15:21.754 --> 15:25.624
by just casually RSVP-ing no
to your own party and then,

15:25.691 --> 15:27.426
and then just waiting
for me to notice?

15:27.493 --> 15:29.028
Well, I knew it would
get your attention.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.763
You know what, dad,
I put a lot of time and effort

15:30.829 --> 15:32.431
into this party, and if
that's not something

15:32.498 --> 15:34.300
that you're gonna
appreciate, I honestly,

15:34.366 --> 15:36.101
I don't know what else
to say, okay?

15:36.168 --> 15:38.804
I gotta go.
[phone beeps]

15:40.673 --> 15:44.343
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.711
[Mike]
So, what are you gonna do?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.379
Oh, I cancelled the party.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.715
I sent out the email already.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.450
Whoa.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.450
What was I supposed to do?

15:51.517 --> 15:54.687
He's acting like a 17-year-old
girl at prom who's crying,

15:54.753 --> 15:56.188
not because someone
has the same prom dress,

15:56.255 --> 15:58.891
but someone's got one
with a similar sleeve.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.727
The similarities of your dad
and a teenage girl are striking.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.962
This is why you shouldn't do
nice things for people.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.464
I don't want to get in trouble
for being nice, but...

16:05.531 --> 16:07.900
Well, then don't.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.900
You're looking good.

16:07.966 --> 16:11.136
Why are you wasting this on
going out with Jennifer, huh?

16:11.203 --> 16:13.439
Mmm, okay, you know
when you say stuff like that

16:13.505 --> 16:16.909
you make it very hard for me to
fantasize about divorcing you.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.712
Okay. There's been a lot
of divorce talk lately.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.648
Should I be concerned?

16:19.778 --> 16:22.648
No, sadly we're definitely

16:22.715 --> 16:25.384
gonna die in each other's arms.

16:25.451 --> 16:26.785
Cool?

16:25.451 --> 16:26.785
I mean, obviously,

16:26.852 --> 16:29.922
I don't want to divorce you,
I love you, blah-blah-blah.

16:29.988 --> 16:33.325
But, you know, I mean,
you gotta admit,

16:33.392 --> 16:35.828
if you were, like, free
from me for, like, three weeks,

16:35.894 --> 16:38.797
you could date, just like,
do whatever you want...

16:38.864 --> 16:40.666
I'm all onboard
with that, but...

16:38.864 --> 16:40.666
Right?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.634
Would you be able to get
all that you want done

16:42.701 --> 16:44.737
in three weeks?

16:42.701 --> 16:44.737
Yeah, good call, actually.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.171
You know what,
let's jam it up to a year.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.740
Wow, a year.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.740
Yeah.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.007
Listen, this isn't
just for me, you know.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.376
Hmm.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.376
You know that

16:50.442 --> 16:52.945
if you're out there,
on the market, you're, like,

16:53.011 --> 16:54.913
a hot commod.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.913
Wow, thank you.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.915
I mean, I do feel like
you'd probably, like,

16:56.982 --> 16:59.985
just fall into something serious
with one person right away.

17:00.052 --> 17:01.286
I'm gonna play the market,

17:01.353 --> 17:03.355
gonna find,
like, 40 dudes.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.090
Wow, that's excessive.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.025
That's not even
one a week, Mike.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.160
It still seems high to me.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.428
I'm being conservative.

17:09.495 --> 17:11.830
I could go up to 52
with a whole year.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.366
I could go up to 104,
really.

17:14.433 --> 17:15.701
I could get
two done in a week.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.269
Now you're just showing off
your math skills.

17:17.336 --> 17:18.837
Wish me luck.
I love you.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.205
Good luck-- good luck?

17:20.272 --> 17:22.174
Hey, that doesn't
start tonight.

17:22.241 --> 17:23.976
It might be-- it depends
how tonight goes.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.549
See, nothing crazy,
it's just a bar.

17:30.616 --> 17:31.884
You've been in them
before, right?

17:31.950 --> 17:34.453
How are there so many people
here on a weeknight?

17:34.520 --> 17:35.821
They're single.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.322
I mean, some of these
people are, like, our age.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.891
They have to have
kids and stuff.

17:38.957 --> 17:41.393
It's one of the perks of
being divorced, you can go out.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.962
Again, I feel like we have
really different definitions

17:44.029 --> 17:45.364
of the word "perk".

17:45.431 --> 17:47.266
I don't think we do.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.266
What can I get for you ladies?

17:47.332 --> 17:50.502
Um, I will have a white wine.

17:47.332 --> 17:50.502
Don't be an asshole.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.504
Um, can we have two
Manhattans, please?

17:52.571 --> 17:53.672
Thank you.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.907
You're welcome.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.907
She's the boss.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.775
Listen, it is a perk,
because now

17:56.842 --> 17:58.477
you have a built-in
baby sitter, okay?

17:58.544 --> 18:01.280
Who else loves your kids
as much as the spouse you hate?

18:01.346 --> 18:02.381
[scoffs]
Okay.

18:02.448 --> 18:03.382
And by the way...

18:02.448 --> 18:03.382
Hmm?

18:03.449 --> 18:05.217
He also is gonna
take them for, like,

18:05.284 --> 18:07.753
a week or more
in the summer.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.823
So you are just like,
what do I do with myself?

18:10.889 --> 18:12.991
You can go to Europe,
you can go to England,

18:13.058 --> 18:15.394
you can go to on one of those
horrible looking cruises

18:15.461 --> 18:17.262
they're always pushing
in front of "Downton Abbey".

18:17.329 --> 18:18.363
On the river?

18:17.329 --> 18:18.363
On the river.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.598
I don't want to do that.

18:19.665 --> 18:20.966
Literally, and I've
thought about this,

18:21.033 --> 18:22.401
the only way to have a great
vacation when you have kids

18:22.468 --> 18:23.802
is to get divorced.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.405
That's a dark perk,
but it is a perk nonetheless.

18:26.472 --> 18:27.573
That's my specialty.

18:27.639 --> 18:28.841
Yes.
[laughing]

18:28.907 --> 18:30.309
Cheers.

18:30.375 --> 18:34.146
[background conversations]

18:34.213 --> 18:36.748
[laughing]

18:37.916 --> 18:39.418
It's like riding a bike.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.254
Yeah, and, like, she can only
do it for 20 minutes at a time.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.756
And you end up with a sore
crotch at the end of the night.

18:44.823 --> 18:45.858
It's your turn.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.430
You raise chickens
in your yard?

18:51.497 --> 18:52.764
I would love to have
fresh eggs.

18:52.831 --> 18:54.366
I should get
some chickens.

18:54.433 --> 18:58.003
Yeah, I see absolutely
no downside to that plan.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.439
[laughing]

19:00.506 --> 19:03.509
And I tried to grab her,
and I'm yelling, "Are you okay?"

19:03.575 --> 19:05.711
And she vomited into my mouth.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.246
Shut up!

19:07.312 --> 19:08.780
I love this story so much.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.082
All right, well, I just text
you then the next time

19:10.148 --> 19:11.617
I'm in Griffith Park.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.151
All right, the next time I'm
in Atwater Village

19:13.218 --> 19:15.787
I'm gonna text you.
Amazing.

19:15.854 --> 19:18.724
Ooh, I got a good photo
of you mid-dart throw.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.325
I am so very drunk.

19:20.392 --> 19:21.860
You are such a lightweight.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.263
What did you have, like, one
drink and part of a beer?

19:24.329 --> 19:25.998
Yeah, I think I just
don't go out very often,

19:26.064 --> 19:27.766
so it just went
straight to my head.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.334
Is it bad that I feel fine?

19:29.401 --> 19:32.371
I'm glad we Uber-ed but...

19:32.437 --> 19:34.439
Are you okay?

19:34.506 --> 19:36.375
[whispering]
I really, I don't feel good.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.012
[monitor beeping]

19:40.078 --> 19:42.080
You're in a hospital.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.615
You were roofied.

19:43.682 --> 19:44.750
What?

19:44.816 --> 19:47.085
I know, I, I, I was with you
the entire time,

19:47.152 --> 19:48.787
you're completely fine.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.422
As soon as we saw
that anything was wrong,

19:50.489 --> 19:51.857
we went straight
to the Emergency Room.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.859
Oh, my God, I was roofied?

19:53.926 --> 19:58.764
Yes, apparently
you were roofied.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.866
We, we, we got fluids
going through you,

20:00.933 --> 20:02.034
we're getting it
out of the system.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.635
This happened
at the bar?

20:03.702 --> 20:06.972
I assume so, I, I,
I don't know.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.308
I'm so sorry for
forcing you to go out.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.344
You were right, it is
a shit show out there.

20:12.411 --> 20:13.579
Listen, if you still want
companionship,

20:13.645 --> 20:15.247
I will share Mike
with you in,

20:15.314 --> 20:17.816
in, like a "Sister Love"
situation.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.785
You mean "Sister Wives".

20:19.851 --> 20:21.587
The wives, the wives,
the wives situation.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.990
"Sister Love,"
that's a darker, darker thing.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.226
How are you feeling?

20:25.057 --> 20:28.226
I guess I'm just glad I'm okay.

20:28.293 --> 20:29.928
I can't believe
that happened.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.331
I thought only college students
and stupid people

20:32.397 --> 20:34.900
who go to raves
get roofied.

20:34.967 --> 20:39.404
On the bright side, I guess
it means you still got it.

20:39.471 --> 20:40.672
[mumbling]
Don't...

20:40.739 --> 20:41.840
Sorry.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.840
I don't like that.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.041
So sorry.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.041
Yeah.

20:43.108 --> 20:44.409
Way too soon.

20:44.476 --> 20:47.145
You know what, I'm gonna go
grab you a juice.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.514
Promise I won't
put anything in it.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.484
Again, I joke when I'm
uncomfortable, you know that.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.752
I'm sorry.

20:53.819 --> 20:56.488
You were drugged.
[laughing]

20:56.555 --> 20:58.256
That is not something
to laugh at.

20:58.323 --> 21:00.425
That is a fact.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.027
Hmm.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.027
I will be right back.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.597
Um, do you want this open or...

21:02.094 --> 21:05.597
Go get the juice.

21:09.901 --> 21:10.936
[sighing]

21:11.003 --> 21:12.004
[mumbling]
Hi.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.272
Hi.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.407
Is she okay?

21:15.474 --> 21:16.775
Yeah.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.211
She's groggy
but she's gonna be fine.

21:19.277 --> 21:20.479
[sighing]

21:20.545 --> 21:23.148
It's so crazy.

21:20.545 --> 21:23.148
I know.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.817
I mean, I feel like this
is my fault.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.154
She told me she didn't want to
go, and I forced her to go out.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.389
It's not your fault.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.091
You didn't know
that would happen.

21:33.158 --> 21:34.626
I know, but what if
this is, like,

21:34.693 --> 21:37.095
the thing
that makes her, like,

21:37.162 --> 21:38.563
never go out again?

21:38.630 --> 21:42.000
She was just
getting out there,

21:42.067 --> 21:46.505
and then... she needed
to get fucking roofied?

21:46.571 --> 21:48.907
She'll be all right,
she's strong.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.910
There was one, though, good
thing that did happen tonight.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.679
Mm-hmm? What?

21:53.745 --> 21:55.313
She was chatting with
some of the night nurses

21:55.380 --> 21:57.883
and now they're all planning
a little girls weekend

21:57.949 --> 21:59.217
in Santa Barbara together.

21:59.284 --> 22:00.919
Oh, that's nice.

21:59.284 --> 22:00.919
Yeah.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.888
Plus, all the nurses are
in their 60's,

22:02.954 --> 22:06.258
so she'll probably look the best
in her bathing suit, which,

22:06.324 --> 22:09.094
obviously should not matter,
but let's be honest,

22:09.161 --> 22:11.096
feels pretty good.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.900
[chuckling]
Yeah, there's my wife.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.234
All right.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.273
I never want to get divorced.

22:21.339 --> 22:23.775
It's nice to know all it took
was a drugging to get there.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.244
Well, you know, that's how
I make most of my decisions.

22:26.311 --> 22:27.946
I have to witness a drugging

22:28.013 --> 22:31.049
and then I really kind of
come to my senses.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.285
You know that, right?

22:31.116 --> 22:33.285
Hmm, yes.

22:33.351 --> 22:35.854
Oh, by the way, um,

22:35.921 --> 22:39.925
I may have offered to share you
with Jennifer in, like,

22:39.991 --> 22:43.495
some sort of "Big Love"
situation, so...

22:43.562 --> 22:45.030
Are you kidding?
I've always had a fantasy

22:45.097 --> 22:47.332
about being a polygamist.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.868
Really? That's your fantasy?

22:47.399 --> 22:49.868
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

22:49.935 --> 22:52.704
While you're married you
fantasize about more marriages.

22:52.771 --> 22:56.308
You sick motherfucker.

22:52.771 --> 22:56.308
[chuckling]

22:57.776 --> 22:58.877
Yours looks good.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.979
Yeah, never go with that,
always go with this.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.148
Always go--

23:01.046 --> 23:03.148
[phone vibrating]

23:03.215 --> 23:05.383
My dad.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.383
Can you pick it up, please?

23:05.450 --> 23:08.053
Someone's gotta end
the madness.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.823
[phone vibrating]

23:08.120 --> 23:11.823
All right, I'll be right back.

23:11.890 --> 23:12.958
Hello.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.893
You cancelled the whole party?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.728
Oh, you mean the party that
you're not going to

23:16.795 --> 23:18.663
for your own birthday?
Yeah, I cancelled it.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.565
Now everyone's asking me
what happened.

23:20.632 --> 23:22.334
Well, did you tell them
it's because you're upset

23:22.400 --> 23:24.970
that my party invitation
slightly tread on

23:25.036 --> 23:27.839
your roaring '20s thing that's
happening ten months from now?

23:27.906 --> 23:29.407
<i>By the way, dad,</i>
<i>mine was burlesque,</i>

23:29.474 --> 23:31.143
which is more '40s
and '50s, okay?

23:31.209 --> 23:33.645
Burlesque was popularized
in the '20s.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.180
Okay, you know what,

23:35.247 --> 23:38.216
I'm sorry I'm not up to date
on my history of sex dancing.

23:38.283 --> 23:39.551
You know, I feel like
this whole thing

23:39.618 --> 23:41.419
is just really a big
misunderstanding.

23:41.486 --> 23:42.587
It's a misunderstanding?

23:42.654 --> 23:44.456
Personally I thought
your invite was insensitive,

23:44.523 --> 23:46.992
but now I can see that
it was unintentional.

23:47.058 --> 23:48.760
You just don't know anything.

23:48.827 --> 23:51.229
Wow! That's the apology?

23:51.296 --> 23:52.731
I mean about
the '20s, honey.

23:52.798 --> 23:54.332
You know tons of
other stuff.

23:54.399 --> 23:55.433
You didn't let me
finish there.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.701
Oh, my God.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.504
Dad, is this really what
this whole thing is about?

23:59.571 --> 24:03.341
Just because my invite
touched on your decade?

24:03.408 --> 24:05.677
Well, yeah.

24:03.408 --> 24:05.677
<i>Would it be helpful if I just</i>

24:05.744 --> 24:08.446
bumped mine to the next
decade, the '30s?

24:08.513 --> 24:09.881
I'd love that.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.384
Great-- wait, was there
burlesque in the '30s?

24:12.450 --> 24:15.453
[condescending]
<i>Well, if it started in the</i>
<i>'20s, doesn't it make sense--</i>

24:15.520 --> 24:17.656
Okay, perfect, then I don't have
to change anything else, right?

24:17.722 --> 24:19.858
Nope. Now I'm excited
about the party.

24:19.925 --> 24:22.027
So happy.

24:19.925 --> 24:22.027
I love you.

24:22.093 --> 24:24.296
I love you too, bye.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.064
[phone beeps]

24:24.362 --> 24:26.064
Everything okay?

24:26.131 --> 24:29.401
Yeah, I mean, the party is
going to be literally exactly

24:29.467 --> 24:32.037
the same, but instead
of the '20s it's gonna be

24:32.103 --> 24:34.172
whatever the call the '30s.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.842
The Depression.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.842
Yeah, that feels right.
