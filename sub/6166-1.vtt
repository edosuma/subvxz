<i>Goat Man took me
on my first trek when I was 11.</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:29.088
<i>Not long after that,
he taught me how to do bong hits.</i>

01:30.173 --> 01:32.049
<i>It doesn't matter
where we go on these treks.</i>

01:32.133 --> 01:33.509
<i>We just wander.</i>

01:34.969 --> 01:37.805
<i>Goat Man says it's
the journey that counts.</i>

01:37.847 --> 01:39.640
<i>Which I know is clich√©.</i>

01:42.727 --> 01:46.021
<i>In a few days, I leave
for the prep school my father went to.</i>

01:47.774 --> 01:50.359
<i>Goat Man's calling this my "farewell trek."</i>

01:50.985 --> 01:53.987
<i>He says I should soak up as much
of the Sonoran sun as I can.</i>

01:54.572 --> 01:56.782
<i>But he's the one doing
most of the soaking.</i>

02:04.249 --> 02:06.875
You won't have all this at Gates Academy.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.088
Naked men shouldn't squat.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.885
Do you ever worry about your parents?

02:19.222 --> 02:21.348
Did you ever?

02:21.391 --> 02:22.599
No.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.018
Not really.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.188
Wendy will be fine.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.190
I'll watch her.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.700
<i>Goat Man once told me
that in certain Native American tribes,</i>

02:39.742 --> 02:42.911
<i>an elder leads a young man out
into the wilderness to fend for himself</i>

02:42.954 --> 02:44.538
<i>until he has a vision.</i>

02:45.665 --> 02:47.374
She never lets me milk her.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.336
<i>In one tribe, if no vision comes
they'll chop off a fingertip</i>

02:51.421 --> 02:53.755
<i>and sacrifice it to the Great Spirit.</i>

02:53.840 --> 02:54.923
Thanks.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.551
<i>Goat Man says I'm not quite ready
for this rite of passage.</i>

02:57.594 --> 02:59.428
Sorry I messed up the trek, Goat Man.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.762
It's not your fault.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.327
I should have never let you
come out here with brand new boots.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.034
I should have oiled them
and let you walk around in them

03:06.077 --> 03:08.453
for a couple days before coming out here.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.441
<i>Goat Man was my parents' friend first.</i>

03:14.611 --> 03:16.531
<i>My mother claims
she can't remember how they met,</i>

03:16.613 --> 03:19.281
<i>but Goat Man told me
he used to sell them peyote.</i>

03:20.116 --> 03:21.950
<i>At one point Goat Man was broke,</i>

03:21.993 --> 03:25.287
<i>so in exchange for cleaning the pool
and taking care of the landscaping,</i>

03:25.371 --> 03:27.289
<i>they let him live in our pool house.</i>

03:27.373 --> 03:29.625
<i>When I was a baby, my father left</i>

03:29.709 --> 03:31.460
<i>and Goat Man stayed.</i>

03:43.806 --> 03:46.642
<i>My mom hasn't paid
a bill in her entire life.</i>

03:46.726 --> 03:47.976
<i>Yet somehow she always knows</i>

03:48.061 --> 03:50.646
<i>how much money she has in her trust fund.</i>

03:54.817 --> 03:55.817
Ten more minutes.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.656
I'm going away to school, Frieda.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.784
I need you to listen
to Goat Man while I'm gone.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.257
<i>This is my neighbor Aubrey.</i>

04:19.341 --> 04:20.341
<i>She's hot, yes,</i>

04:20.385 --> 04:23.011
<i>but at the risk
of sounding like a misogynist...</i>

04:23.054 --> 04:24.346
I see you, Ellis!

04:24.722 --> 04:26.306
What, are you jacking off back there?

04:26.349 --> 04:28.016
<i>...she's sort of a rancid bitch.</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:29.851
No, Frieda just stopped to eat.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.187
- That's a goat.
- You're so dead!

04:35.233 --> 04:36.275
Pervert!

04:39.946 --> 04:41.613
Ignore the pain.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.908
Luckily, her meatheaded boyfriend
was barefoot.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.662
Messed up feet and
a big cut on your forehead.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.414
Not a very good send off.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.167
Thanks, Goat Man.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.045
Are you packed yet?

04:57.714 --> 04:59.214
Yeah, I finished this morning.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.174
I prepared a bag of buds for you.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.720
That shit'll cream your spinach.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.097
Ever heard of security checks?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.058
I'll mail it to you.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.813
My roommate better be cool.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.608
He could have the best weed
on the East Coast.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.029
Probably a Facebook addict with halitosis.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.245
My boy's leaving me tomorrow.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.916
Leaving me for the big bad world
of Gates Academy.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.711
Ellis, your feet are all red!

05:38.421 --> 05:39.921
From my new hiking boots.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.966
Figures Fucker Frank would send you
third-rate hiking boots.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.595
- Tightwad.
- Those are, like, $300 boots from Italy.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.929
I wish I had a pair.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.890
That's not good parenting.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.572
He should try calling
you once in a while,

05:51.601 --> 05:53.268
at least pretend to care.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.229
I ordered you 14 Oxford shirts.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.981
You'll barely ever have to do laundry.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.066
- Okay?
- Thanks.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.276
Not to mention everything else
that I bought you.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.028
I appreciate it.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.198
You don't have to leave, you know.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.283
You can still change your mind.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.328
You act like I'm going off to war.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.663
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.500
- I'm sad.
- You still have me.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.001
Jav!

06:20.171 --> 06:22.297
I paid 700 extra to the electric company,

06:22.340 --> 06:26.510
so you won't have to worry about that
for another three months.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.638
All the other bills are paid,
and I renewed the insurance on the Volvo.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.265
You don't even know
how much I'm going to miss you.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.644
You don't know. You don't know.
You don't know.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.357
I'm gonna miss you, too.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.776
A lot.

07:07.885 --> 07:08.885
Mom.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.222
My flight's in two hours.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.651
<i>The white zone is for</i>

07:24.694 --> 07:27.195
<i>immediate loading
and unloading of passengers...</i>

07:27.238 --> 07:28.363
You don't have to wait.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.157
My flight's not, like, for another hour.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.908
- You sure?
- Yeah.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.804
Go on.
The goats are roasting in there.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.495
I'll be fine.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.789
You take care of Wendy, all right?

07:38.416 --> 07:40.792
- I'll call you once I get there...
- Don't worry.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.551
Many rivers to cross, partner.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.474
Bye, guys.
Be good.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.602
- I think Frieda ate a map.
- Bullshit.

07:58.686 --> 07:59.769
Frieda!

08:00.980 --> 08:02.063
Damn it.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.590
<i>Wendy has referred to my father
as "Fucker Frank"</i>

08:28.633 --> 08:30.592
<i>for as long as I can remember.</i>

08:30.635 --> 08:32.501
<i>So you can imagine her reaction
when I told her</i>

08:32.528 --> 08:34.971
<i>I had secretly applied
and was accepted here,</i>

08:35.056 --> 08:37.097
<i>the same prep school he went to.</i>

08:38.976 --> 08:41.602
So I heard this story
about this guy who went to Berkeley,

08:41.645 --> 08:43.337
and every night when
he would go to sleep,

08:43.422 --> 08:45.131
he would wake up
and his ass would be sore.

08:45.174 --> 08:47.416
So after three months of this,
'cause it got really bad,

08:47.501 --> 08:50.236
he decided to go to the doctor
and try to find out what's going on.

08:50.279 --> 08:53.005
And the doctor said, "Well, have you
been having any anal sex lately?

08:53.048 --> 08:55.491
"Because that's what it looks like
your ass has been doing."

08:55.575 --> 08:58.410
And the guy's like, "No, no. I'm straight.
Why would I be doing that?"

08:58.453 --> 09:01.533
So the guy calls the cops to see if they
can maybe figure out what's going on,

09:01.581 --> 09:02.957
and it turns out that his roommate

09:03.041 --> 09:05.161
was knocking him out
with colorform every single night

09:05.210 --> 09:06.727
and butt fucking him.
Crazy, right?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.296
Can I hang this on the door?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.346
You must be Barney Cannel.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.098
Yes, sir.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.977
I was hoping Wilt Chamberlain there
was Barney Cannel.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.186
How tall are you, son?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.313
I was 5'10" last time I checked.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.650
- I'm out of shape, though.
- Get in shape. Run for us.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.860
I don't think I'd be any good.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.405
Come on, don't tell me
you're not going to play any sports.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.290
I haven't really thought about it.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.508
Well, think about it.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.536
Dough boy,
we practice every day from 3:00 to 4:00.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.997
You miss two, you're off the team.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.498
Yes, sir.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.745
Where are you going to go to college?

09:48.829 --> 09:50.205
My brother Todd, he goes to Yale.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.840
That's where I'm going.
Yale.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.260
- Are you serious?
- Is that guy homeless?

09:55.553 --> 09:57.762
No.
He's a botanist.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.723
And a goat trekker.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.725
Is he your dad?

10:03.978 --> 10:05.061
No.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.484
You're only supposed to be buttoned up
for the convocation, moron.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.111
Welcome to Gates, boys.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.322
Hi, I'm Barney Cannel,
Todd Cannel's younger brother.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.364
Right.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.908
Todd told me to tell you
that he very much enjoys Yale.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.201
Thank you.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.704
- And you're Ellis Whitman?
- Yes, sir.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.665
Dr. Eldridge.
We're happy to have you at Gates.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.710
Your father Frank and I were roommates,
you know,

10:28.753 --> 10:30.879
and I was lucky enough
to run with him senior year.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.631
My father ran for student government?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.758
He was class president,
but I meant cross-country.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.522
We were on
the cross-country team together.

10:37.887 --> 10:38.970
How is he?

10:40.097 --> 10:41.514
He's fine, I guess.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.391
You look like him, you know.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.335
Tell him to give me a phone call, will you?

10:46.387 --> 10:47.595
- Yeah, sure.
- See you, boys.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.318
Hey, I didn't know
Eldridge and your dad boned.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.999
<i>It's been 23 days
and four hours since I last got high.</i>

11:08.084 --> 11:09.717
<i>The one kid I thought was a stoner here</i>

11:09.760 --> 11:11.419
<i>turned out to just be a slob.</i>

11:11.504 --> 11:14.339
<i>There's no good Mexican food
in a 200-mile radius.</i>

11:14.674 --> 11:16.508
<i>Goat Man's been incommunicado.</i>

11:17.176 --> 11:19.177
<i>And when my classless,
Teletubby of a roommate</i>

11:19.261 --> 11:20.595
<i>isn't whining about his grades,</i>

11:20.680 --> 11:22.389
<i>he's copying my homework.</i>

11:23.974 --> 11:25.100
Sorry.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.645
I shouldn't even be here.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.107
Our secret.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.281
You know that one girl
who works in the dining hall?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.078
The one who Rosenberg says
is a prostitute?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.830
That trashy townie chick?

11:46.914 --> 11:49.416
She's always sneaking in the library
and using our shit.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.668
Todd told me she is a prostitute.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.379
She'll do juniors and seniors
for, like, 50 bucks.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.549
Your brother's full of shit.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.594
At least he's not a drug addict
who hangs out with goats all day.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.806
Pot's not addictive.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.517
Todd writes me and sends me letters.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.769
Mr. Goat hasn't sent you shit.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.147
His name's Goat Man, asshole.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.605
Whitman.
Come here.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.716
I thought we weren't supposed
to talk to each other out here.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.111
Only if you're going to go jerk off.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.738
Rosenberg's from Maui.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.824
He's one of three Jews on the island.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.743
He can't seem to get better than a C
in any of his classes,

13:48.786 --> 13:51.746
but he's smart enough
to get his weed through airport security.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.915
Man, I knew you were a stoner.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.336
- How?
- I saw your High Times calendar

13:58.420 --> 14:01.089
and Barney said you smoke up
with your gardener.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.716
He's not my gardener.
He's...

14:03.759 --> 14:05.385
Mr. Rosenberg.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.846
Mr. Cannel's roommate.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.726
Enjoying a little cannabis, I see and smell.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.603
Just me, sir.
Rosenberg didn't have any.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.471
He was actually trying to convince me to...

14:17.556 --> 14:18.631
I'll deal with you later.

14:18.674 --> 14:21.634
I need a moment alone
to talk to the tall one.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.570
Keep it moving.

14:26.907 --> 14:27.991
Well.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.578
Looks like you'll be enjoying
cross-country after all.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.042
We practice at 3:00 tomorrow.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.300
Pick it up, fellas.
Pick it up!

14:46.468 --> 14:49.345
I have bowels that run faster than you,
let's move!

14:52.391 --> 14:54.142
Come on, Quadzilla, pick it up.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.810
I can't.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.062
You can't or you won't?

14:59.690 --> 15:02.442
You weren't joking.
You really are out of shape?

15:03.027 --> 15:04.110
I have blisters.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.989
Did those blisters stop you
from hiking into the woods

15:08.032 --> 15:10.241
to smoke weed with Rosenberg?

15:13.537 --> 15:15.955
Move it, move it, move it!

15:17.291 --> 15:19.292
Five more hills, let's go!

15:23.213 --> 15:24.964
Hounds misses Sharky.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.174
Let go.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.468
Her teeth!

15:32.514 --> 15:34.682
Here comes Mrs. Sharky!

15:35.267 --> 15:36.267
Let go!

15:38.187 --> 15:40.188
That one scares me a little bit.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.151
Who are you?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.695
I'm Bennet, Wendy's lover.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.157
Boy, oh, boy.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.826
Oh, yeah.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.664
Must be nice, Javier, living here.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.542
Rent-free, just cleaning the pool.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.129
Taking care of the landscaping.
No worries.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.090
It is nice.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.843
That's your name, isn't it?
Javier?

16:11.345 --> 16:12.428
Sure.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.056
That's so funny,
you don't look like a Javier.

16:15.599 --> 16:19.727
Right, Wendy told me
about your goat treks.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.770
Where do you go?

16:22.064 --> 16:24.607
- I wander.
- Where?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.067
I can't be specific.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.069
Why not?

16:29.446 --> 16:30.738
It's my job.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.326
What do you do?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.914
I'm an artist.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.499
Do you get high?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.420
I've moved beyond that.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.672
Sadness.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.470
Hey!
Quit it, Lance!

16:56.932 --> 16:58.766
It's about time.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.686
What's up?

17:02.604 --> 17:04.689
I got a package to mail.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.442
Hey, is this enough stamps?

17:07.526 --> 17:09.468
If this is what I think it is,
you might as well

17:09.511 --> 17:11.271
just go check yourself
into prison right now.

17:11.346 --> 17:13.372
Once I handed it to you, I was home free.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.950
Not even close.
How's Ellis out there, anyway?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.719
I haven't heard from him yet,
but I'm sure he's okay.

17:18.762 --> 17:20.054
What about all my stamps?

17:20.372 --> 17:21.455
Peel them off.

17:22.665 --> 17:23.790
Hey, you wanna get high?

17:24.334 --> 17:25.792
I can't today.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.673
Hey, leave it.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.925
All right, come on, goats.

17:46.857 --> 17:47.940
Shit!

17:51.945 --> 17:53.488
I don't know why you're surprised.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.157
All stoners are unreliable.
He's not going to send you anything.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.241
Shut the hell up.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.615
It just doesn't make any sense.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.868
I haven't seen him in years,

18:07.953 --> 18:10.095
and he thinks I'm just gonna
show up on his doorstep?

18:10.138 --> 18:11.872
Well, at least your
dad sends you letters.

18:11.915 --> 18:13.499
Mine's not allowed to.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.011
Look, I'll be down there in DC
for Thanksgiving, too.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.930
We can hang out and party in Georgetown.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.183
What are you going to do?

18:22.226 --> 18:25.812
Sit around here and wait for pot
in the mail that probably won't come?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.024
Don't stay here.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.901
It's not gonna be any fun.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.236
You're gonna do nothing.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.072
And you're just gonna get depressed,
all right?

18:36.156 --> 18:37.990
Come to DC with me.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.409
What about her?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.370
Go ahead and ask her.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.206
We both will.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.961
Excuse me, ma'am?

18:50.546 --> 18:53.047
Please don't call me ma'am.
I'm barely 31.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.049
May we ask you a favor?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.717
Let me guess, you go to Gates,

18:56.802 --> 18:59.554
and you want me to buy you beer
or cigarettes or porno.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.223
Just Budweiser.
A six pack of Budweiser.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.604
Bottles or cans?

19:08.689 --> 19:09.981
- Cans.
- Bottles.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.482
Bottles.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.903
Then she made me and Todd
watch a slide show on her laptop

19:15.988 --> 19:19.157
of my dad kissing another man
on Poodle Beach in Rehoboth.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.826
"There's your father, boys.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.163
"There's your father and his boyfriend,
in love."

19:26.206 --> 19:27.686
Then she came over and made Todd say,

19:27.749 --> 19:29.083
"My dad's a faggot."

19:30.669 --> 19:33.087
I wouldn't say it,
so she tried to move my jaw

19:33.130 --> 19:36.132
and that's when she burnt me
with her cigarette.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.760
By mistake.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.931
- My mailman's gay.
- My dad's not gay.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.893
That was just a phase.
He lives with some woman in Houston now.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.352
I'm not allowed to see him.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.108
I don't know if my dad's
in New York or DC.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.154
- He's always with some new slut...
- I gotta pee.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.460
Shit.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.152
Fucker Frank.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.156
Runners, come on, let's go.
Knees up!

20:55.170 --> 20:56.170
Hello?

20:58.006 --> 21:00.883
Who's this?

21:01.510 --> 21:02.551
Let me talk to Wendy.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.053
Tell me who this is.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.647
Hello?

21:15.691 --> 21:18.359
Is this 520-887-4311?

21:18.568 --> 21:19.735
Who is this?

21:20.654 --> 21:21.654
Put Goat Man on.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.739
Tell me who this is.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.550
My mom has a new asshole boyfriend.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.726
She'll have a meltdown
if I go to Frank's.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.064
So you'll stay here and eat
depressing meals with the teachers

21:57.107 --> 21:58.941
and their grubby families?

21:59.443 --> 22:00.901
Come to DC.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.470
That one question where
you're supposed to find out

22:03.555 --> 22:05.331
how many grandchildren
does Mrs. Smith have,

22:05.373 --> 22:06.507
I kept getting negative six.

22:06.550 --> 22:09.118
Yeah, Mrs. Smith and her
grandchildren can suck my dick.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.537
Some dick got a 96
and messed up the curve.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.874
Ellis and I studied our asses off all night,
and I only got a 73.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.876
What'd you get, Ellis?

22:16.918 --> 22:18.878
- Ninety-six.
- Douche.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.421
Hey, here's my girl.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.882
I see her here every Tuesday
and Thursday at this time.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.259
Yeah, after she's done servicing
the juniors and seniors.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.182
- You're an asshole, Barney.
- Shut the hell up.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.764
Hi, Ellis.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.015
Hey.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.518
Ellis, how does she know your name?

22:41.943 --> 22:46.072
This is the doll.
She's brand new today, ladies.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.429
We've done a version of Sasha before.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.120
But this is a new configuration.

22:54.831 --> 22:55.952
So it's the only day that...

22:55.957 --> 22:57.208
Hello?
Who is this?

22:58.543 --> 23:00.928
Tell Wendy that I'm spending
Thanksgiving with Fucker Frank

23:01.012 --> 23:02.429
and his girlfriend in Washington.

23:02.472 --> 23:04.807
If she doesn't want me to,
she knows how to contact me.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.302
And remind her that the Volvo
is supposed to be serviced this month.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.721
So, this is Ellis?

23:11.640 --> 23:12.807
Just tell her.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.267
Oh, boy!

23:25.821 --> 23:27.488
Ellis!
Your mom just called.

23:27.572 --> 23:31.075
She wants you to go to Tucson
for Thanksgiving, and not to go to DC.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.829
So she calls now?

23:34.913 --> 23:36.914
She sounded really stoned!

23:39.668 --> 23:41.043
Come on.
Let's go.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.521
Oh, shit!

24:02.649 --> 24:04.558
Could you come over here
and clean this, Javier?

24:04.601 --> 24:06.060
I'll switch chairs.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.780
Excuse me?

24:09.865 --> 24:12.992
You just got to pick up the shards

24:13.034 --> 24:15.619
and spray the juice with the hose
before it gets sticky.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.707
- You broke the glass, not me.
- Yes?

24:19.791 --> 24:22.501
Get up off your ass and clean it.
I'm busy with this bush.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.212
Well, it's your job, not mine.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.881
Hey, buddy, fuck you.

24:33.889 --> 24:34.889
What did you say to me?

24:36.766 --> 24:38.350
You're free-balling, man.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.102
What?

24:40.729 --> 24:42.229
One of your nuts wants out.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.278
There you go.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.907
I think that you and me and Wendy
need to have a talk

24:52.991 --> 24:54.450
about your place around here.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.661
You mean the pool house?

24:59.372 --> 25:03.542
- Who's awake!
- Me! Me! Yeah, I needed to sleep!

25:03.627 --> 25:04.627
Yeah.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.171
I've been so worried.
You know, Ellis never called.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.759
The pool looks really nice, Javier.
It's so blue.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.013
Aren't you the chick
that threw the rock at Ellis?

25:16.097 --> 25:17.515
Yeah.
So what?

25:17.599 --> 25:20.851
- Besides, Ellis was spying.
- Come on.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.561
I need to feel like a mom again.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.772
It's been so long since Ellis left.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.649
I'm going to take Aubrey to the mall.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.660
I'll pick you up some of those
boxer shorts you like.

25:29.744 --> 25:31.245
What about me?

25:32.447 --> 25:33.989
We'll get you a new swimsuit.

25:34.658 --> 25:35.783
That is so sick!

25:35.867 --> 25:38.702
And Bennet, clean up that juice mess
before the ants come.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.793
What do you mean,
you're leaving right now?

25:45.835 --> 25:46.919
It's Thanksgiving!

25:46.962 --> 25:49.255
Stop, right now.
You need to behave.

25:49.297 --> 25:50.798
Why do you have to go?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.280
You know what, because I need to go.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.384
Please!
This isn't fair!

25:53.468 --> 25:54.760
It's totally fair.

25:54.803 --> 25:58.222
Because you're acting out.
This is totally fair, now I feel justified.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.646
She's such a bitch.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.326
Tastes like ass.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.329
You would know.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.961
If your friend's sleeping over,

26:29.004 --> 26:31.964
I don't want him touching anything
in the guest room.

26:32.007 --> 26:35.009
I leave in two hours.
Don't touch anything.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.885
The credit card is in the kitchen.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.610
You can have Thanksgiving
at the Beckers'.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.847
Fine.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.717
At least you can do whatever you want
the whole weekend.

26:44.352 --> 26:48.689
If she weren't so selfish, she would be
going to Paris on Monday instead.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.235
My mom wrote the book on selfish.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.738
Fuck.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.542
- I'll call you later, okay?
- All right.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.432
It's good to see you.
You look tall.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.810
I grew, I guess.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.189
- You look different, too.
- Yeah?

27:30.231 --> 27:31.231
Yeah.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.269
Judy will be glad to know
that you think I look different.

27:35.353 --> 27:40.190
She's been sort of
cultivating my new image.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.326
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

27:43.745 --> 27:47.331
I forgot to show you my store
back there on the right.

27:49.668 --> 27:53.295
I actually sold all 48 stores
to a furniture conglomerate.

27:54.130 --> 27:57.341
They're changing the name to Adobe,
which I think is dumb, but...

28:00.428 --> 28:01.637
What do you do now?

28:03.014 --> 28:05.849
I still... I keep pretty busy.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.309
Yeah, I read a lot.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.274
Yeah.

28:14.609 --> 28:18.779
A senator from Georgia lived
in this house for 30 years in the 1800s.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.240
That's actually a portrait of him there.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.283
Dog lover, I guess.

28:25.453 --> 28:27.955
Listen, about Judy and me,

28:28.289 --> 28:30.290
the reason I wanted you to visit...

28:32.335 --> 28:34.653
I thought I smelled it in the car.
Have you been drinking?

28:34.695 --> 28:36.113
Hey, guys.

28:37.006 --> 28:40.843
Ellis, it's so nice to finally meet you.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.722
You, too.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.766
You been hitting the bottle today?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.226
That's what I thought.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.815
Why don't you bring your bag upstairs?
It's the first bedroom on the left,

28:54.899 --> 28:56.817
and then you can meet us at the table.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.486
You can eat off any lingering inebriation.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.201
He'll be okay.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.837
I don't share Judy's cavalier attitude
about your drinking.

29:17.338 --> 29:20.257
I don't have a cavalier attitude.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.281
Ellis, do you want some more stuffing?

29:24.679 --> 29:25.846
Yes, ma'am.

29:26.055 --> 29:28.056
Ellis, you can call me Judy.

29:34.355 --> 29:37.232
You know, you're the one who's cavalier.
You're married again.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.998
I'm gonna have a new brother or sister,
and you didn't even tell me.

29:40.862 --> 29:41.904
Brother.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.490
A new brother.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.074
You're only 14 years old.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.618
What were you drinking?

29:47.702 --> 29:49.669
And where the hell
were this kid's parents anyway?

29:49.712 --> 29:50.946
I'm 15 years old.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.540
We were drinking scotch,
and Barney's mother's in Paris.

29:54.542 --> 29:55.876
He never sees his father.

29:57.378 --> 29:58.778
Is that supposed to mean something?

30:00.924 --> 30:02.591
He spilled the scotch on me, by the way.

30:02.675 --> 30:04.555
That's why you could smell it.
I barely had any.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.638
Okay.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.264
Excuse me.

30:15.396 --> 30:19.149
Hey, Frank knows you're 15.

30:19.901 --> 30:23.111
I mean, that's how he refers to you,
as his 15-year-old son.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.406
He sent you those hiking boots
for your birthday last June.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.784
I was with him when he bought them.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.544
When he got your midterm grades,

30:39.003 --> 30:42.089
he called to tell me about them.
All As.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.758
He said he never once
got all As at Gates.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.803
He's proud of you, Ellis.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.889
No.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.141
Thanks.

30:53.226 --> 30:56.186
You've never heard of Gates Academy?
It's very famous.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.437
It's very traditional.

31:00.024 --> 31:03.277
No cell phones, no Internet in the dorms,

31:03.319 --> 31:04.528
they force you to take Latin.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.115
Tell Ellis not to worry.
I mean, Latin's a dead language.

31:08.157 --> 31:10.158
- It's useless.
- I'm taking Spanish.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.120
Say something in Spanish, honey.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.500
That one's smart.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.452
She just said, "I want to eat cheese."

31:20.495 --> 31:21.703
Sorry I'm late.

31:22.463 --> 31:25.090
Ellis is with Frank, and he hasn't called.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.884
He'll call.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.219
- You stoned?
- No.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.388
I told you I'm not.

31:31.472 --> 31:32.806
I'm not.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.060
I love your tie.
It's so tribal.

31:37.353 --> 31:38.812
Okay, everybody,

31:40.315 --> 31:43.650
we are going veggie this year.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.194
This is faux turkey.

31:47.822 --> 31:51.325
- It smells wonderful.
- Tofu turkey. Who would've thought?

31:52.827 --> 31:55.328
I wonder what kind of shit
they're feeding Ellis in Washington.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.247
You promised.
No Frank talk.

31:57.498 --> 32:00.876
So, Javier, tell me about
the next goat trek you're planning.

32:01.669 --> 32:03.170
It's still in the works.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.340
The goats are in training.
They're afraid of the water.

32:06.674 --> 32:10.052
I'll be taking them up
to higher elevation soon, to snow.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.804
Black and tan male
with the horns, Lance...

32:12.847 --> 32:14.848
- Yeah, that's him.
- Lance. Yeah.

32:14.891 --> 32:19.019
He bothers me when I'm reading
my paper by the pool. Very bad gas.

32:19.062 --> 32:22.272
If goats don't fart,
their intestines will explode.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.858
- I highly doubt it.
- No, I've seen it. A major mess.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.947
I saw a baby goat once, born inside out.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.741
- Inside out.
- Gross!

32:33.201 --> 32:36.328
You know, Jav, I think you may be
onto something with these goat treks.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.413
Yeah, a return to the earth.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.958
You know, I bet Johanna would love

32:41.042 --> 32:43.335
to hear about these goat treks,
wouldn't she?

32:43.544 --> 32:45.796
Wouldn't she?
She's our spirit coach.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.298
She's always interested
in new forms of spirit healing.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.717
I'm not sure these treks
have healed my spirit.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.219
I bet they have.

32:52.553 --> 32:56.056
You didn't even notice,
'cause you're not in touch with your spirit.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.224
It's a good point, Javier.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.415
What?

33:22.250 --> 33:23.709
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom, it's me.

33:23.751 --> 33:27.379
Ellis, I told you
I needed you here this weekend.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.589
Why didn't you at least
call me yesterday?

33:29.632 --> 33:32.259
Ellis!
Do you want me to wash your fleece?

33:33.136 --> 33:34.594
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.310
What does she look like?

33:43.688 --> 33:44.938
It's not the same Judy.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.356
It's not the same Judy?

33:46.607 --> 33:48.316
This one's really nice and attractive.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.110
Attractive?

33:50.778 --> 33:52.446
Okay.
How young is she?

33:52.947 --> 33:54.748
I don't know.
Maybe a little younger than you.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.533
Figures.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.620
- What about Frank?
- He's fine, I guess.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.832
He has new glasses.
Poetry glasses.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.543
Poetry glasses?

34:06.711 --> 34:09.629
Hey, Ellis, Frank's home.
It's time to go.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.005
Okay, thanks.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.632
Hey, Mom.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

34:14.217 --> 34:15.302
Why?

34:15.386 --> 34:18.221
Frank has some kind of tour planned.
He just got back.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.893
You're making a big mistake.

34:25.646 --> 34:27.147
Mom, I have to go.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.070
- Bye. Okay?
- Fine.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.413
I've been looking
for this record for years.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.791
I can't even find it on the Internet.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.417
Do you even have a turntable?

34:48.002 --> 34:50.378
- Yeah, Goat Man got me one.
- Of course he did.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.259
So, you like Judy?

34:57.512 --> 34:59.096
Yeah, she's really nice.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.432
Look, don't tell her I told you this,

35:02.517 --> 35:04.250
but when you wrote for me
to come down here,

35:04.293 --> 35:06.268
at first I thought you were talking
about the Judy

35:06.353 --> 35:07.962
you brought to Tucson a few years ago.

35:07.988 --> 35:09.768
- The loud obnoxious one...
- That was Trudy.

35:09.798 --> 35:12.217
And she wasn't obnoxious.
She was nervous.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.996
You know it was your mother
that kept me away from Tucson

35:17.081 --> 35:18.206
for all that time.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.767
Every time I'd show up,
she'd start some new drama,

35:20.809 --> 35:22.810
even if I didn't bring along a lady friend.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.794
Does she still refer to me as
"Fucker Frank"?

35:46.435 --> 35:48.937
- Hello.
- Can you put Wendy on the phone?

35:49.730 --> 35:50.730
Who's calling?

35:51.315 --> 35:53.817
You know who this is.
Just put her on the phone.

35:54.068 --> 35:57.320
I can't. She went to a healing
vortex workshop in Sedona.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.822
She won't be back till tomorrow.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.408
Okay, when she gets back,
tell her I've gone on a trek,

36:01.492 --> 36:02.742
backside of Mt. Lemmon.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.911
Four days.
She likes to know where I go.

36:05.079 --> 36:08.540
Why? As far as I can tell,
she wouldn't care if you disappeared.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.792
She's done
with your chemically-induced lifestyle.

36:13.462 --> 36:16.256
I didn't ask for your response to that...
Hello?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.343
Dick!

36:20.428 --> 36:25.223
He's a dick!

37:11.312 --> 37:12.312
Hey, guys.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.988
You fuckers ate my weed!

37:33.000 --> 37:34.251
That's it, you win!

37:36.504 --> 37:37.837
We're going home.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.465
Idiots.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.225
Yikes.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.906
You ordered the health food?

38:48.409 --> 38:50.035
Dig in.

38:50.077 --> 38:51.328
Pizza.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.455
I already feel like a cow.

38:53.539 --> 38:56.041
You're not a cow.
Not even close.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.417
He can come back anytime.

38:58.377 --> 39:02.172
Hey, you know, you should really think
about joining us in Telluride this summer.

39:02.256 --> 39:05.300
You can mountain bike and camp and swim.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.260
And we'll have the baby by then.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.557
Hello?

39:12.641 --> 39:14.726
Hello.
May I please speak with Ellis Whitman?

39:14.769 --> 39:15.810
Just a minute.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.437
It's for you.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.189
Is it my mother?

39:19.815 --> 39:22.484
No, it's your roommate.
He's very polite.

39:24.236 --> 39:25.695
- What?
- I got pot!

40:53.868 --> 40:56.035
I meant what I said about Telluride.

40:56.245 --> 40:58.746
I think it'd be great
for you to come out this summer.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.207
I don't think so.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.003
- Frank, come on.
- Are you kidding, honey?

41:05.045 --> 41:06.796
He shows up drunk for Thanksgiving dinner.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.048
You sneak out last night
to do God knows what.

41:09.091 --> 41:10.717
How are you going to stay in school?

41:10.801 --> 41:13.219
I'm getting all As
except for an A-in Latin.

41:13.387 --> 41:14.471
Mea culpa.

41:18.767 --> 41:21.102
How do you expect me to do this
when you don't give a shit?

41:22.563 --> 41:24.063
You don't give a shit, either.

41:24.106 --> 41:26.441
- Are you kidding me?
- Okay. Guys?

41:27.234 --> 41:28.401
All right.

41:39.413 --> 41:40.705
You know,

41:40.748 --> 41:43.541
if you were getting an inheritance
from your dad,

41:43.584 --> 41:45.376
now you have to split it.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.215
Haven't you had enough of that shit?

41:53.552 --> 41:55.094
Don't tell me what to do.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.979
You're gonna have
to wash those in the sink.

42:13.063 --> 42:14.647
I can smell the alcohol from over here.

42:17.826 --> 42:19.644
You can't leave them there,
we'll get busted.

42:19.686 --> 42:22.188
- Go wash them in the sink.
- Fuck you, you're not my boss.

42:23.666 --> 42:24.832
What's your problem?

42:24.917 --> 42:26.417
Wash the fucking pants!

42:35.511 --> 42:37.303
My award!
You asshole!

42:48.148 --> 42:50.066
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get up!

42:50.150 --> 42:52.652
Get up.
Both of you calm down!

42:52.695 --> 42:53.820
Are you okay?

42:58.367 --> 43:01.369
Let's get to the bottom of this
so we can all get on with our lives.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.288
Tell me what happened tonight.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.957
Barney was being obnoxious,
so I tackled him.

43:06.125 --> 43:07.166
And before that?

43:07.376 --> 43:09.460
Barney was being obnoxious before that.

43:09.503 --> 43:11.671
He means,
what did you do before the fight?

43:11.839 --> 43:14.841
Like, were you and Barney
drinking any alcoholic beverages?

43:15.509 --> 43:18.177
I'm quite capable of expressing myself,
Mr. Rosenberg.

43:18.220 --> 43:19.512
And why are you here, anyway?

43:19.555 --> 43:21.806
I'm not feeling good.
I think I have the flu.

43:22.850 --> 43:25.491
You can wait in the hall until I'm done
speaking with Whitman here.

43:25.561 --> 43:29.397
But I'm suffering from FACT.
Fever, aches, chills, and tiredness.

43:29.690 --> 43:30.857
The hall.

43:35.988 --> 43:37.322
I'll tell you what happened.

43:38.657 --> 43:41.034
You and Barney, Mr. Cannel.

43:41.118 --> 43:43.620
You and Mr. Cannel
were drinking on the bus.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.539
You argued, you started to fight,

43:46.582 --> 43:50.001
you threw his award against the wall,
and he kicked you in the testicles.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.004
That sounds pretty close, sir.

43:55.507 --> 43:58.843
I've looked at your midterm reports,
Mr. Whitman. You're doing well.

43:59.261 --> 44:01.012
I study a lot.

44:02.598 --> 44:05.975
So tell me about your visit with your father.
How's he doing?

44:10.189 --> 44:11.856
Okay.

44:12.441 --> 44:13.858
Now, business.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.069
No more weekend privileges,

44:16.111 --> 44:18.312
and you're going to have
sequestered detention dinners

44:18.397 --> 44:19.605
until next semester.

44:19.865 --> 44:21.907
And, of course, you know
I'm going to have to call

44:21.992 --> 44:24.032
your mother in Texas
to inform her of this incident.

44:24.035 --> 44:25.945
- I live in Arizona, sir.
- Of course. Phoenix.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.664
- Tucson.
- You bet.

44:50.062 --> 44:51.396
Hi, Wendy.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.529
Get down here and roll.

45:00.072 --> 45:03.616
Listen to your body, Javier.
You know, it's good stress therapy.

45:03.659 --> 45:04.909
No, thanks.

45:07.413 --> 45:08.955
I was wondering if...

45:09.415 --> 45:10.957
You know where your checks are?

45:11.041 --> 45:12.917
If I could maybe...
I was thinking I could...

45:12.960 --> 45:14.502
I could write myself one,

45:14.837 --> 45:16.504
for, you know, last month.

45:16.672 --> 45:19.966
I ordered that Fortunella japonica,

45:20.008 --> 45:22.176
the kumquat bush for outside
the den window.

45:27.015 --> 45:29.600
The headmaster called
from Gates this morning.

45:30.018 --> 45:32.979
Ellis did some drinking
on the way back to school

45:33.063 --> 45:35.273
from his stay with Fucker Frank.

45:35.691 --> 45:37.650
He and his roommate got into a fistfight.

45:37.735 --> 45:42.739
And I have to write a check for $700
to patch a wall that Ellis broke.

45:43.615 --> 45:46.200
I can't see Ellis in a fight like that.
Is he okay?

45:46.285 --> 45:49.162
No, of course he's not all right.
What do you think?

45:49.246 --> 45:51.873
After a weekend with Frank,
I'm sure he's a total wreck.

45:53.667 --> 45:56.669
The headmaster also said that Ellis
has the highest grades in his class.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.338
They're turning him into a Frank clone.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.550
They're already talking to me
about colleges.

46:02.634 --> 46:04.051
- He's only 15.
- I know.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.262
He shouldn't have to worry about
things like that.

46:06.346 --> 46:09.849
I can't take care of him from here, Javier.
I can't.

46:09.892 --> 46:11.392
I can't do it.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.810
I miss him.

46:13.395 --> 46:17.356
I miss him so. I miss him
way more than I thought. Way more.

46:17.399 --> 46:20.067
- How are the bills and stuff?
- That's not why I miss him.

46:20.903 --> 46:23.529
I'm a mother
and my son is 3,000 miles away.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.406
I am missing a piece of myself.

46:26.492 --> 46:27.825
He'll be home soon.

46:27.868 --> 46:33.039
Johanna said that mothers and sons,
even though we share the same blood,

46:33.081 --> 46:36.083
can sometimes be as cosmically distant

46:36.168 --> 46:38.419
as two strangers on different continents.

46:38.504 --> 46:43.633
I don't see why a mother should be
concerned about relating cosmically.

46:43.717 --> 46:45.134
You should just call him up,

46:45.761 --> 46:50.348
and ask him about school, food, girls.

46:52.559 --> 46:54.977
I should really just be mainstream?

46:55.854 --> 46:57.188
Sure.

47:07.032 --> 47:08.616
Sorry, nothing came for you.

47:10.285 --> 47:11.410
Thanks.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.120
You can check again tomorrow.

47:22.422 --> 47:23.840
Hey.

47:28.554 --> 47:31.264
Someone hasn't been at dinner in a while.

47:32.057 --> 47:34.642
I got sequestered detention dinners
until next semester.

47:36.645 --> 47:38.479
I never took you for a bad boy.

47:42.234 --> 47:45.820
- You're always in here.
- I'm not illiterate.

47:48.615 --> 47:53.536
I'm working my way through a list
of the 100 best novels of all time.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.042
This is my third favorite book.

48:01.461 --> 48:02.461
The Great Gatsby.

48:03.839 --> 48:06.048
My second's To Kill a Mockingbird.

48:12.389 --> 48:14.599
All right.
What's your favorite?

48:18.770 --> 48:20.771
Wouldn't you like to know.

48:36.955 --> 48:39.957
You know, you can play your music louder.
I don't mind.

48:41.543 --> 48:42.752
Thanks.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.525
I'm gonna fail algebra tomorrow,

49:06.568 --> 49:09.195
and I'm gonna fail history on Wednesday,

49:09.279 --> 49:11.322
and I'm gonna flunk out of Gates.

49:13.325 --> 49:15.159
I guess you're not going to Yale.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.412
I probably deserve it
for kicking you in the nuts.

49:18.497 --> 49:20.373
That was a cheap kick.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.292
I'm sorry.

49:24.711 --> 49:25.711
I just...

49:25.796 --> 49:27.880
I can't even do completing the square

49:27.965 --> 49:30.257
and I only know
the first cycle of the Krebs cycle

49:30.342 --> 49:33.052
and all the kings in history seem the same.
And I just...

49:33.136 --> 49:35.304
I don't know what to do anymore.

49:35.847 --> 49:38.849
I'm gonna flunk out of Gates.
I'm never gonna do anything.

49:57.119 --> 50:01.163
Here's a good trick for history
that Goat Man taught me, all right.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.749
See this portrait of Pope Leo X?

50:06.294 --> 50:10.297
Look at him.
Remember his name and read what he did,

50:10.716 --> 50:13.092
then imagine him doing it.
Okay?

50:36.033 --> 50:39.243
You know, I owe you one.
You really saved my ass.

50:41.121 --> 50:42.121
I know.

50:42.205 --> 50:45.624
I'm going to study over break,
so I'm not such a loser next semester.

50:46.918 --> 50:51.172
I'm gonna float on a raft in the pool
and smoke a bale of pot

50:53.133 --> 50:54.967
and go running a lot.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.678
- Won't the pot cancel out the running?
- Hey, bad boy!

50:59.264 --> 51:00.931
Merry Christmas.

51:04.186 --> 51:06.854
You know, Smythe and Van Buren
were in the car with Minnie.

51:08.815 --> 51:11.417
She's probably giving them a ride
to the bus station or something.

51:11.459 --> 51:13.627
I bet she's giving them a ride.

51:14.821 --> 51:16.405
The water's nice.

51:17.407 --> 51:18.991
It's nice and warm.

51:19.451 --> 51:21.035
I love the water.

51:21.661 --> 51:23.496
Yes.
Yeah.

51:23.538 --> 51:24.830
Okay, boy.

51:24.915 --> 51:25.998
Right there.

51:26.208 --> 51:27.458
Good boy.

51:28.502 --> 51:29.919
There you go.

51:34.007 --> 51:36.133
You have pretty nice arms for a stoner.

51:39.012 --> 51:40.012
Hey!

51:41.556 --> 51:42.807
What are you doing?

51:43.058 --> 51:46.060
The goats hate water,
so I'm training them not to.

51:46.770 --> 51:49.772
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but there's no water in there.

51:49.856 --> 51:52.691
Well, you obviously
know nothing about training goats.

51:52.734 --> 51:54.568
First they have to get used to the pool.

51:55.695 --> 51:57.196
What are you doing later?

51:59.658 --> 52:00.950
You sure are nosy.

52:01.743 --> 52:03.953
I just want to know
what makes you tick, Javier.

52:04.621 --> 52:06.372
For example, what are those?

52:12.587 --> 52:14.004
Ever hear of art?

52:18.176 --> 52:19.885
Bennet and Wendy are in Sedona

52:19.928 --> 52:23.097
on that New Age bullshit
spirit workshop, right?

52:25.142 --> 52:26.725
When do they get back?

52:51.293 --> 52:54.211
That was quick.
I was just getting comfortable.

52:58.550 --> 53:00.134
What do you do?

53:00.760 --> 53:02.595
What do you do all day?

53:04.472 --> 53:06.056
Do?

53:13.523 --> 53:15.691
You know, I do the landscaping.

53:16.902 --> 53:18.485
Work with the goats.

53:20.405 --> 53:21.989
Clean the pool.

53:23.742 --> 53:25.242
Don't you get bored?

53:27.704 --> 53:29.455
Well, I do other stuff.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.419
Like get high all day?

53:38.965 --> 53:42.134
Is it true what they say
about you and your goats?

53:43.011 --> 53:45.429
That you know them in the biblical sense?

53:46.640 --> 53:48.224
It's not true.

53:48.934 --> 53:50.517
I hate my goats.

54:14.167 --> 54:15.167
What the hell?

54:15.961 --> 54:18.295
- Sorry. Are you Ellis?
- Give me my bag!

54:18.338 --> 54:19.421
Pervert.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.132
I'm not a pervert, I'm Bennet.

54:34.896 --> 54:35.980
Wendy?

54:37.190 --> 54:38.274
Mom?

54:38.942 --> 54:40.025
Ellis.

54:40.402 --> 54:42.278
You scared the hell out of me, Ellis.

54:43.196 --> 54:44.280
Sorry.

54:46.366 --> 54:49.201
I've had these miserable headaches
since September.

54:49.953 --> 54:54.081
Starts in my heart, goes around my head,

54:54.165 --> 54:56.208
and back down to my heart.

55:00.797 --> 55:04.091
Come here, come give your mom a hug
and tell me how was your trip.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.723
- I slept on my flights.
- Yeah.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.977
Did you miss me?

55:17.897 --> 55:20.482
- Of course I missed you.
- I couldn't tell.

55:32.746 --> 55:35.706
Yeah, that's it.
Toke the fat pappy, girlie.

55:36.249 --> 55:38.083
Hey, Ellis!

55:38.668 --> 55:39.918
Aubrey?

55:40.295 --> 55:41.295
That's my bong.

55:44.466 --> 55:46.925
I thought your plane
didn't get in till tonight.

56:03.276 --> 56:04.651
Lance, leave it!

56:05.612 --> 56:07.446
Lance, quit it!

56:13.787 --> 56:16.163
I can't even get him to follow me.

56:18.666 --> 56:20.667
Maybe he's disappointed in you.

56:22.629 --> 56:25.798
- I know you think I'm a traitor, but...
- She's not even half your age.

56:26.966 --> 56:29.802
She looks older, you have to admit.

56:34.974 --> 56:36.975
You could have at least written me
or something.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.143
Yeah.

56:41.564 --> 56:43.565
I'm bad at that.

56:45.819 --> 56:46.985
Sorry.

56:47.821 --> 56:49.321
And Bennet.

56:51.032 --> 56:52.741
You should have warned me about him.

56:52.826 --> 56:53.867
Yeah.

56:54.661 --> 56:56.703
He's a royal dick.

56:59.165 --> 57:03.252
Hey, I'm going on this big trek
the day after Christmas.

57:03.837 --> 57:05.587
Down into Mexico.

57:06.756 --> 57:08.257
You want to come, partner?

57:10.510 --> 57:11.718
I don't know.

57:13.263 --> 57:14.638
Frieda, come on.

58:21.164 --> 58:22.748
- Ellis!
- Hi, Jonathan.

58:23.124 --> 58:24.541
How's the fancy prep school?

58:24.584 --> 58:26.919
It's fancy.
I study a lot.

58:26.961 --> 58:29.087
I got blackmailed
into running cross-country.

58:29.172 --> 58:30.881
- What about the girls?
- What girls?

58:31.299 --> 58:33.300
- It's all boys.
- Exactly!

58:34.761 --> 58:38.305
Did the Goat Man have any luck
sending you any provisions?

58:38.681 --> 58:41.600
He tried sending something
via US Mail, but I stopped it.

58:41.643 --> 58:42.643
Really?

58:43.269 --> 58:45.270
It isn't worth the risk these days.

59:01.955 --> 59:03.956
We have to make this fast!

59:07.961 --> 59:10.462
Because your Spanish is horrible.

59:13.466 --> 59:15.867
It's past 6:00 already.
I should be home wrapping presents.

59:15.910 --> 59:16.593
I appreciate it.

59:16.636 --> 59:18.679
You haven't shown me
how much you appreciate it.

59:18.763 --> 59:21.682
I appreciate it this much.

59:25.019 --> 59:27.479
What have you been
getting up to lately anyway?

59:28.523 --> 59:34.361
I've been breeding non-eco intrusive goats
for the biosphere.

59:34.696 --> 59:36.738
Plus some rescue goats

59:36.823 --> 59:41.118
that are trained to sniff survivors
out of the rubble in a disaster,

59:41.160 --> 59:43.328
should there be a disaster.
Disaster goats.

59:43.997 --> 59:46.364
- Sounds important.
- I'm going to make this easy for you.

59:46.407 --> 59:48.766
Just use the clippers.
Just, you know...

59:48.835 --> 59:51.044
- You sure?
- Yeah, make me look like Steve McQueen.

59:54.173 --> 59:55.716
I'm a scientist.

59:55.883 --> 59:57.426
Not a hippie.

59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.186
- No, olives are a party favor.
- When's the last time

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.612
you got olives as a party favor?

01:00:01.697 --> 01:00:03.489
That's 10 points
because it's a double word.

01:00:03.573 --> 01:00:04.516
Mexican casserole!

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:07.102
"H". A party favor that begins with "H".

01:00:08.354 --> 01:00:09.855
- "Hookah."
- That's a foreign word.

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.106
It doesn't count.

01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:13.066
Sorry I'm late.

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:18.478
I'm cleaning up my act.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.033
You look amazing.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:22.826
Let me touch.
Touchy-feely.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.870
Hi, baby.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:28.206
Okay, if everybody's done
fawning over Goat Man,

01:00:28.249 --> 01:00:30.242
hookah is a foreign word,
so that's doesn't count.

01:00:30.284 --> 01:00:32.565
I'll look it up in the dictionary,
the English dictionary,

01:00:32.578 --> 01:00:34.898
- if you really want to challenge.
- Yeah, challenge. Yeah.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.383
Bennet. Bennet, honey,
you're going to lose your turn.

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:42.471
- "Hookah, an Oriental tobacco pipe..."
- Oriental.

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:45.349
"...with a long flexible tube
that draws the smoke through the water

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:47.525
- "in a tin bowl."
- So that's still a foreign word.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.186
No, but it's in the English dictionary.

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:52.522
- Like "charlatan" is.
- Yeah.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:55.067
Or "gigolo."

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:57.903
Or "fellatio."

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.490
Honey, you lose your turn.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:02.866
All right, okay.

01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:04.451
Honey!

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:05.744
Hey, hey, honey.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:06.870
"Hissy," noun.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.081
- "A fit of anger. Temper tantrum."
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:01:09.123 --> 01:01:11.249
Hey, you know what,
that's the kind of snarky bullshit

01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:13.335
that Frank used to pull all the time.

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:17.381
My God, you are turning into him.
You're turning into him.

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:19.633
Wait, are you talking about Fucker Frank?

01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:21.876
You know, you never finished
telling me that story...

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.000
- Aubrey! Aubrey!
- I know.

01:01:23.003 --> 01:01:25.371
Well, you want to know more
about Fucker Frank, ask Ellis.

01:01:25.398 --> 01:01:26.515
He's his new best friend.

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:29.518
And she should know the hell
that that man put me through.

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:33.897
And now he sends you an old sweatshirt
and everything is hunky-dory?

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:37.025
I bought you a $2,000 mountain bike,

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.653
and you don't have the
decency to try it out.

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:42.082
- I said thank you, like, 100 times.
- I didn't hear it.

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.531
- Feelings check.
- Did you hear it?

01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:46.201
Feelings check.

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:49.121
I feel that you might
be reacting negatively.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.292
- Feelings check.
- Right, Wendy? Feelings check.

01:01:51.457 --> 01:01:53.375
Feelings check.
Shut the hell up!

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:59.464
You know, marrying that man was
the worst decision I have ever made.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.802
Why don't you tell Aubrey about the time
that you and Frank got in a fight

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.637
and how you disappeared for six days?

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.806
And he had to find you
living in a cheap motel?

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.142
- So?
- Or why don't you tell everyone

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:12.561
why Frank never visits Tucson anymore?

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:15.363
How you hid the keys to his rental car
and made him miss his flight.

01:02:15.448 --> 01:02:18.892
Okay, I don't need to be attacked
by my own son!

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.485
Fucking genetics!

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.447
You are the biggest, selfish prick
I have ever met!

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:25.157
Bigger than your fucking father!

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:29.161
Mister, you are coming with me
to Sedona tomorrow,

01:02:29.203 --> 01:02:31.663
and you are going to do
that workshop with Johanna!

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:35.167
Yes, you are!
No more fucking goat treks!

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.668
Good job.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:52.684
Listen, this is a special trek.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.853
We're on a mission of philanthropy.

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:58.190
- What do you mean?
- We're helping a refugee

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.776
from Honduras into the United States.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.445
That's illegal, isn't it?

01:03:04.363 --> 01:03:06.448
She's a political refugee.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:10.076
- You're joking, right?
- No.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.579
My cousin Jesus set it up.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.710
Is Jesus real Mexican or fake Mexican,
like you?

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.880
Fake Mexican?
What does that mean, fake Mexican?

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:25.383
Yeah, you know how you make
everyone call you Javier

01:03:25.426 --> 01:03:28.053
even though your real name's Stephen
and you're Irish-Italian.

01:03:30.097 --> 01:03:33.225
I don't make everyone call me Javier.

01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:34.768
They just do.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.314
How are we gonna get the goats
across the border?

01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:42.067
No one's gonna stop us.

01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:43.777
Getting them to Mexico is no problem,

01:03:43.861 --> 01:03:45.862
we'll be crossing the desert
on the way back.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:08.260
After we meet Jesus at the Super Puerco,

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.928
we can party all night.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.098
Don't use "party" as a verb.
It sounds vulgar.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:17.519
Vulgar in the common, pedestrian sense,
not in the obscene sense.

01:04:17.603 --> 01:04:19.604
I knew what you meant by "vulgar."

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:22.607
The bar's either to the
left or to the right.

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:24.818
That's helpful.

01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:35.453
Try to look presentable.

01:04:35.496 --> 01:04:36.705
Like me.

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.140
Jesus!

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.268
What the fuck do you want?

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.855
It's me, Javier.
I cleaned up for the trek.

01:05:01.939 --> 01:05:03.356
You look like a cop, man.

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:05.817
Who's the kid?

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.320
This is Ellis.
He's good with the goats.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:12.991
Go outside and wait with the goats.

01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:20.874
All right.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.171
Can we do this in English?

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:34.179
Those are the ugliest dogs I've ever seen.

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:35.889
Thanks.

01:05:36.557 --> 01:05:38.016
Get out of here, please.

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:42.437
Sorry about Jesus.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:45.231
Isn't Jesus married with some kids?

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.275
Those prostitutes were, like, my age.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.694
Where's the refugee?

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:51.446
The refugee?

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:54.032
She had to go back to Tegucigalpa.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.034
Family issues.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.862
So this whole thing was a waste of time?

01:05:58.904 --> 01:06:01.322
No, this was a good practice run.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:14.552
You're setting it up in a wash?
That's dumb.

01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:16.346
They're rain clouds.

01:06:16.555 --> 01:06:18.239
If you're so concerned
about being spotted,

01:06:18.324 --> 01:06:20.325
why the hell do you have
a bright orange tent?

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:24.312
- I'm starving.
- Frieda's right there. She's full of milk.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.732
I'm looking for my power bars
and I find your sandwich, cheater.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.694
What about Javier's golden rule
of goat trekking?

01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:32.779
- Goat milk only.
- Hey! Put that back!

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:35.490
Jesus.

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:41.663
This wasn't my idea.

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:44.749
Not everyone is as
fortunate as you, Ellis.

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:48.086
Wendy and Bennet might kick me out,
and I don't have any money!

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:55.135
There never was a refugee, was there?

01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:58.805
I swear, you don't know what it's like
having to ask Wendy for money.

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.849
Then get a job like a normal person!

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.351
I'm not a normal person.

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:06.563
Come on, let's go.
Pack up the tent.

01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:08.106
We'll camp somewhere else.

01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:10.483
Let's go.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.444
Would you just give me a second?

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.208
- Come on. Get up.
- Get your hands off me.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.036
Damn it!
Lance!

01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:23.288
Lance!

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:30.962
Goat Man.

01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:47.979
Goat Man!

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:52.817
Goat Man.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:50.291
Goat Man's going to be okay.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.970
- Ellis, sweetie!
- That goat's not riding in my Jeep.

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:03.638
Are you okay?

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:05.765
Did Goat Man call?

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:13.439
The healing workshops were great.
Thanks for asking.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.857
Aren't you even the slightest bit
worried about him?

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:21.072
The Hopi shaman at the workshop
said that I worry too much.

01:09:22.073 --> 01:09:23.408
Yeah, about yourself!

01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:27.828
Okay, I can't leak my energy right now
worrying about Goat Man.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.749
I have been advised to let it pool inward.

01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:35.086
Frank and Judy are married
and they're having a baby.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.801
He's lying, hon.
He's trying to hurt you.

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:51.644
Let's go.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:19.130
Okay, I know you're at Gates.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.715
I know you're smart.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.635
You make pretty good decisions.

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:27.180
But I do worry about you.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.682
All the time.

01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.311
I'm your mother.

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:38.399
And just so you know,

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.986
I was on the phone with
Johanna and the shaman,

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:46.032
and without me telling anything
about what happened,

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:50.828
the shaman mentioned
that Goat Man knows the desert

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:55.250
and knows how to survive.

01:10:57.211 --> 01:10:58.378
Okay?

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.047
And notice,

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.342
I haven't said anything about Frank

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:06.678
or his child bride.

01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:47.051
- May I please speak to my mother?
- Who is this?

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.220
How many children does Wendy have?

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.556
- Did he call?
- Who?

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.057
Don't be a prick!

01:11:53.225 --> 01:11:57.228
You never even bother to ask
about me or your mother. That is rude.

01:11:57.938 --> 01:11:59.439
Did Goat Man call or not?

01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:01.816
Well, I have a slight cold,
and your mother...

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:09.574
Maybe you should have Se√±or Levy
call the police in Mexico and ask

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.943
- if they've heard anything...
- I'm sure Goat Man's fine.

01:12:11.985 --> 01:12:13.236
Stop whining about him already.

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:14.912
Line up, girls!

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.667
Eat my shit.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.098
Quick one.

01:12:36.268 --> 01:12:37.852
Not bad, Whitman.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.864
Did you have PE today?

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:51.991
Did you get sweaty?

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.365
We should get drunk and go see that,
that'd be awesome.

01:12:57.414 --> 01:12:58.998
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:06.297
Nice bike.
Is that carbon fiber?

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:07.799
Yeah, I think so.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:09.967
Give it to me.

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:11.135
What?

01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:20.436
Ellis!

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:22.146
Ellis.

01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:23.981
Oh, no.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.819
Come on, sit up.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:28.945
Sit up.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.352
I read To Kill a Mockingbird.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:06.691
And at first I thought
Atticus was sort of self-righteous.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.861
But by the end...

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:13.489
You think there are people
like Atticus Finch in real life?

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:19.412
I hope so.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.728
Enjoy the Percocets.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.482
Bye.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.401
Once you have made a cut
around the eyeball,

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:52.278
separate the eye into two halves.

01:14:52.529 --> 01:14:54.722
Let the vitreous humor
and any associated structure...

01:14:54.806 --> 01:14:56.199
Barney, we're already on step six.

01:14:56.241 --> 01:14:58.201
Can I finish?
This is step seven.

01:14:58.243 --> 01:15:00.328
- Can I finish reading?
- I'm already done.

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:02.288
You may need to tease the vitreous humor

01:15:02.372 --> 01:15:04.332
gently away from the lining of the eye.

01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:06.667
I think I'm just gonna cut the retina.
Yeah.

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:08.586
That's definitely not the retina.

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.863
It doesn't look like
you're doing anything right.

01:15:10.947 --> 01:15:13.107
- I got it.
- Wait, no, no, that's the cornea.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.842
No, that's the cornea, you moron.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.678
Careful, you don't want
to blind that cow forever.

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:19.597
What are you doing here?

01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:23.809
I felt like taking a drive, I guess.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:24.977
What happened to your head?

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.981
He got bike-jacked.
Four stitches.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.442
By a townie.
They hate all Gates students.

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:32.818
What do you mean?

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:34.903
It's fine. It's healing quickly.
Where's the photo?

01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:40.618
I'd like to introduce you
to your new brother,

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.620
Gabriel.

01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:46.123
He looks like Judy.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.085
Actually, he's a dead ringer for you
when you were a baby.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:57.218
You know, it's a known fact that all babies
look like old Jewish men.

01:16:01.014 --> 01:16:03.933
Oh, boy, go easy on me.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.269
Senior year.

01:16:07.604 --> 01:16:09.605
It's not as dorky as I thought.

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:13.901
Wait, Latin club?
Young Historians?

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.143
I was only in those for my dad,

01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:19.615
who was convinced I was too stupid
to get into college on grades alone.

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:21.492
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:23.578
- Eldridge said you were a brain.
- No.

01:16:24.329 --> 01:16:26.706
When I was admitted to Princeton,
my father said,

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:30.626
"Everyone wins the lottery once.
Don't blow this, Frank."

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:37.258
Ellis, do you like it here?

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:42.513
I mean, you know you can go back
to Tucson, or you could even come to DC.

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:44.807
There are a lot of good day schools there.

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.269
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.272
I like it here, though.

01:16:51.898 --> 01:16:53.224
We have our first meet next week.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:57.461
Coach put me on the varsity team.
I'm actually pretty fast.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:58.904
Really?

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:03.659
Yeah, that was my room
junior and senior years.

01:17:04.244 --> 01:17:05.870
- You lived in Stillwell?
- Yeah.

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:07.371
It's all nerds now.

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:10.416
It was all nerds then, too.
You saw my yearbook photos.

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:13.419
You think Goat Man's all right?

01:17:14.838 --> 01:17:18.257
Disappearing for a few months
is a very Goat Man thing to do.

01:17:20.218 --> 01:17:22.219
- What about Wendy?
- Why?

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.015
I don't know.
She seems weird.

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.392
She never returns my calls.

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:32.229
She's really into New Age spirituality
and freaks out a lot.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:35.399
Well, when I first met her,
she was really into The Grateful Dead

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:37.193
and she freaked out a lot.

01:17:38.945 --> 01:17:40.938
Ellis, I've always had a hard time
with your mom,

01:17:41.022 --> 01:17:42.606
but that's not an excuse.

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:46.035
I'm sorry I've been absent from your life.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:50.706
Thanks.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.862
I'm sure you've had your fill
of the Gates food,

01:17:56.946 --> 01:18:00.115
so we'll go out for dinner tonight.
Barney, too, if he wants.

01:18:02.552 --> 01:18:04.113
Are you sure you want to invite Barney?

01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:06.931
So Yale's application process
is really tough,

01:18:06.973 --> 01:18:09.758
but I've been studying hard,
and Ellis has been helping me out a lot,

01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:11.911
so I think I've got a really good shot
of getting in.

01:18:11.995 --> 01:18:14.647
But if I don't get into Yale,
I'm gonna try for Tufts.

01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:17.942
It's a little early to be
worrying about college, isn't it?

01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:21.153
This isn't the right way to the restaurant.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.782
Yeah, we got a little business
to take care of before dinner.

01:18:27.285 --> 01:18:30.029
I'll talk reasonably to his parents
and if I don't make any progress,

01:18:30.113 --> 01:18:31.447
I'll call the police.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.083
- Hello.
- Yes?

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.252
I've come to retrieve my son's bicycle.

01:18:36.294 --> 01:18:37.795
I believe you assaulted him and...

01:18:41.341 --> 01:18:45.344
Mr. Whitman,
are you still taking us to dinner?

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:57.314
Thanks for coming.

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:00.317
Thanks for getting my bike back.

01:19:00.944 --> 01:19:02.778
Think about Telluride this summer.

01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:04.989
Judy would love it if you were there.

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.323
I mean, I would, too.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:11.495
Actually, so would your brother
if he could distinguish shapes.

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:13.873
I will.

01:19:14.499 --> 01:19:15.916
I almost forgot.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.170
It's a prospectus for my new company.

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:21.881
Solar panel technology for vehicles.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:25.426
I assembled a team of geniuses,
aside from myself.

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.762
I didn't want you to think
I wasn't doing anything.

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.348
I'll look through it.

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:39.440
Good luck with the race next week.

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:42.777
I'm really proud of you, Ellis.

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:44.528
Thanks.

01:19:45.363 --> 01:19:46.989
See you soon.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.209
You got a package.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.377
You're studying history already?

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.962
Who's it from?

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.057
Goat Man!

01:20:14.726 --> 01:20:16.143
It's from Goat Man!

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:22.566
Close the door.

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:28.906
Well, of course!
Look at what's happening!

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.866
Bullshit.
You're a liar.

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:33.402
- You're a liar. You're a big, fat liar.
- It's the only thing.

01:20:33.445 --> 01:20:36.789
I can't help but think that if you could
just corral your energy, just redirect it,

01:20:36.873 --> 01:20:39.808
- then you wouldn't be doing this.
- No matter how I redirect my energy,

01:20:39.851 --> 01:20:40.935
you will always be a pig.

01:20:41.019 --> 01:20:42.336
The jig is up.
Leave.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:45.313
- It's disgusting to think...
- But I still have to go through with it.

01:20:45.356 --> 01:20:48.166
- ...that you would put...
- 'Cause I've got to put food in my mouth!

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:52.346
...your slimy penis into me after that.
That's disgusting!

01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:53.810
- Get out of my face!
- All this...

01:20:53.823 --> 01:20:55.999
- Get out of my face, you slut.
- ...seems so drastic.

01:20:56.083 --> 01:20:57.768
You're a big fat slut.
Get out of my face.

01:20:57.810 --> 01:20:59.044
If that's what you want, I...

01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:00.396
I'm done bankrolling you.

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:01.981
- Leave.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:13.492
Runners, take your mark.

01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:22.561
Hey.

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.147
Hi, there.

01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:26.857
What are you doing here so early?

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:29.944
Picking up my pathetic check.

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:37.159
I got my bike back.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.410
That's good.

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:39.912
Good.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.334
I was thinking,

01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:52.591
if you wanted to meet me off campus,
you could.

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:01.934
I don't think so.

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:03.394
Come on, Ellis.

01:23:03.436 --> 01:23:05.316
Why don't you spend
some of that allowance money

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:09.566
your parents send you
for being the perfect boy?

01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:18.075
- If you change your mind...
- I won't.

01:23:31.756 --> 01:23:33.507
Grapes of Wrath.

01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:37.803
It's my favorite novel.

01:24:33.526 --> 01:24:35.110
We gotta get you home.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:37.696
I think Wendy wants to take you out
to dinner for your birthday

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:41.658
and maybe show you your birthday present,
if you're up for it.

01:24:41.993 --> 01:24:44.036
I almost forgot it was my birthday.

01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:59.009
You know, when I was little,

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.470
I used to love to hear Wendy
do a primal screaming.

01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:03.514
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:06.058
It meant she'd actually be happy
for the few days afterwards

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:07.351
and play with me.

01:25:08.478 --> 01:25:10.145
Thank God Bennet's gone.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.357
- Yeah, she actually kicked him out.
- No?

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.525
It was awesome.

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:16.568
You know what else?

01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:19.530
She milked Frieda
the whole time I was gone.

01:25:19.572 --> 01:25:21.031
Kept her lactating.

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:25.661
Yeah, exactly.

01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:34.628
Forty acres.

01:25:35.547 --> 01:25:38.298
There'll never be a 7-Eleven
or a Wal-Mart out here.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.219
I forget how cool Wendy can be, you know.

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.388
I helped pick it out.

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:51.603
That house all the way over there is
owned by a surgeon from Canada.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:55.482
The rest is National Forest land.

01:25:56.776 --> 01:25:58.777
It even smells good out here.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.155
This is the coolest birthday present.

01:26:01.906 --> 01:26:02.906
Hey.

01:26:03.032 --> 01:26:04.658
Welcome home spliff?

01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:06.785
No, thanks.

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.955
I got plenty.
Enough for the whole summer.

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:12.291
The greenhouse is going strong.

01:26:14.127 --> 01:26:18.088
I was thinking of maybe going
to Telluride with Frank and Judy

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:19.840
and Gabriel for the summer.

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:23.760
Gabriel?

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:26.221
That's the baby's name, Gabriel?

01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:27.431
Yeah.

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:31.143
I think you should go.

01:26:31.811 --> 01:26:33.812
I think that would be good for you.

01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:37.107
Yeah.

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:39.276
That'll be good for you.
