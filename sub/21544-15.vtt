WEBVTT

00:05.434 --> 00:07.049
So why are we at the gala

00:07.096 --> 00:09.986
for the Flintheart Glomgold wing
of the Natural History Museum?

00:10.063 --> 00:12.354
Uch, yeah,
and look at this tacky setup.

00:12.431 --> 00:15.174
Somebody is trying
waaay too hard.

00:15.297 --> 00:16.882
I'll have a virgin peach julep

00:16.959 --> 00:19.377
in your fanciest glass,
thank you!

00:21.446 --> 00:24.533
All these exhibits are just
from times Glomgold lost to you.

00:24.610 --> 00:26.685
A pebble from
the Lost City of El Dorado.

00:26.762 --> 00:29.219
A singed kilt
from that fire pit in Krakatoa.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.275
And this "Glomosaurus Rex"

00:31.352 --> 00:33.598
is clearly just a bunch of
random parts stuck together.

00:33.675 --> 00:35.661
Honestly, how could
you know it wore a crown?

00:35.764 --> 00:37.932
So what are we doing
here anyway?

00:38.009 --> 00:39.713
As upstanding citizens of note,

00:39.790 --> 00:44.494
it's our responsibility to support
Duckburg's cultural institutions.

00:44.719 --> 00:48.148
And these cocktail weenies are
on Glomgold's dollar.

00:48.225 --> 00:49.295
Aren't you rich?

00:49.372 --> 00:50.708
Why do you need free food?

00:50.785 --> 00:52.908
I didn't get rich
by wasting money.

00:52.985 --> 00:55.651
I got rich
by besting my enemies.

00:56.382 --> 00:58.130
Stock up, lads!

00:58.794 --> 01:00.790
Uch, these custom suits
are the worst.

01:00.867 --> 01:02.114
I think I'm gettin' a rash.

01:02.393 --> 01:03.858
That's the plastic lining.

01:03.935 --> 01:06.315
Saves on dry cleaning
and you lose less dip.

01:07.103 --> 01:08.617
It's not the cut of the suit,

01:08.694 --> 01:10.116
it's how you wear it.

01:10.193 --> 01:12.270
Take my playfully loose bow tie.

01:12.347 --> 01:14.250
Is he coming? Is he going?

01:14.327 --> 01:17.181
Did he party so hard
it just flew open?

01:23.374 --> 01:24.809
What is it, a cursed villain?

01:24.886 --> 01:27.352
- A villainous curse?
- A... um...

01:27.996 --> 01:29.486
Man, I hate going third.

01:29.571 --> 01:32.852
Worse. It's my ex!

02:31.479 --> 02:34.938
Your ex?! As in "ex-girlfriend"?

02:35.015 --> 02:38.073
Ex-partner,
ex-rival, ex-everything.

Episode Title:
<font color=#FFFF00>"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!"</font>

02:44.596 --> 02:46.767
Watch your wallets, boys.

02:47.064 --> 02:48.611
Please, Scrooge.

02:48.681 --> 02:50.558
I wouldn't steal from children.

02:50.635 --> 02:52.790
Unless they had something
I really wanted,

02:52.867 --> 02:54.236
or I was bored, or...

02:54.313 --> 02:55.894
Goldie O'Gilt,

02:55.971 --> 02:58.019
the Ice Queen of Dawson.

02:58.096 --> 03:00.845
I thought I heard the
clatter of cloven hooves.

03:00.922 --> 03:03.941
Scroogey McMoneybags,
the tightwad of Duckburg.

03:04.018 --> 03:08.177
That clatter was probably your brittle
bones settling, ya gilded geezer.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.277
I feel both disturbed
and intrigued.

03:10.611 --> 03:12.386
Oh, hello, Scrooge!

03:12.463 --> 03:14.007
This is my date, Goldie.

03:14.084 --> 03:16.520
What's that?
Your ex, you say?

03:16.597 --> 03:19.418
How awkward
this must be for you.

03:20.799 --> 03:22.144
I'm not your date.

03:22.221 --> 03:25.421
Does it make your blood
boil with jealousy, Scrooge?

03:25.498 --> 03:27.746
You're just a sad third wheel.

03:27.823 --> 03:29.379
Deadwood! A...

03:32.619 --> 03:34.238
What?! Gah!

03:34.315 --> 03:35.918
Touché, Goldie.

03:35.995 --> 03:38.637
Let the love games begin.

03:46.322 --> 03:48.759
It's been a long time, Scrooge.

03:48.836 --> 03:51.575
And yet it still feels too soon.

03:51.710 --> 03:55.402
Ooh, your tango's as rusty
as your joints, old man.

03:55.518 --> 03:57.719
How's this for rusty?

03:59.257 --> 04:02.805
Oh! Not bad,
but let the lady lead.

04:06.863 --> 04:08.296

Ooooh! Scrooge has a crush!

04:20.849 --> 04:22.613
True love is truly ageless.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.098
Ooh-ooooh!

04:24.192 --> 04:25.470
Somebody dance with me!

04:25.547 --> 04:27.116
I need to make her jealous!

04:29.520 --> 04:32.366
You're looking younger
than the last time I saw you.

04:32.496 --> 04:35.409
Found a fountain of youth
in Wronguay. You?

04:35.486 --> 04:37.175
Stuck in
a timeless demon dimension.

04:37.252 --> 04:38.402
Which one?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.195
Pandemonium or Demogorgona?

04:40.272 --> 04:42.636
Demogorgana.
Went to stop an uprising.

04:42.713 --> 04:45.354
Get out! I caused that uprising!

04:45.431 --> 04:47.373
Nabbed the Eye of Demogorgon.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.037
Makes you impervious to burns.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.506
I must've just missed you.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.459
What are you really up to?

05:05.536 --> 05:07.480
Why do you always think
I'm up to something?

05:07.557 --> 05:11.623
Because wherever you go, you leave
a flaming wreck in your wake.

05:11.700 --> 05:14.764
Can't start a fire
without a spark, Scroogey.

05:15.443 --> 05:18.307
Ladies and gentleman,
hated rivals,

05:18.384 --> 05:21.544
I am proud to unveil
a brand new exhibit,

05:21.621 --> 05:24.761
dug up by me very own oil crew
in the Yukon.

05:24.838 --> 05:26.088
Behold!

05:26.165 --> 05:31.966
The feared, the terrible...
Glacier Monster of the Klondike!

05:32.090 --> 05:34.763
I know that beast!

05:37.132 --> 05:38.695
What?!

05:39.390 --> 05:40.652
- What's going on?
- Is this a surprise?

05:40.986 --> 05:42.418
Goldie!

05:43.615 --> 05:44.899
Step on it, Launchpad!

05:44.976 --> 05:46.100
I need to get to the mansion!

05:46.177 --> 05:49.462
Ooh! Tell us about
your new old girlfriend!

05:50.793 --> 05:52.764
Ooh! Did you smooch in the dark?

05:52.841 --> 05:54.664
Ooh, smooching!

05:54.741 --> 05:57.602
We weren't smooching,
ya wee nupties.

05:57.679 --> 06:01.082
It was all part of her plan
to steal that mammoth skull!

06:01.159 --> 06:04.332
Oooh, so you could
smooch it together?

06:04.444 --> 06:06.250
- Eww.
- What?

06:06.327 --> 06:08.885
No! Because that was
no ordinary skull.

06:09.055 --> 06:10.563
<i>Back during the Gold Rush,</i>

06:10.640 --> 06:13.152
<i>when I was prospecting for
my fortune in the Klondike...</i>

06:13.229 --> 06:17.009
Gold Rush? Wait...
how old <i> are</i> you?

06:17.890 --> 06:20.826
<i> I let that swindler</i>
<i>Goldie repay a claim</i>

06:20.903 --> 06:25.557
<i>by helping me search for the legendary
Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains.</i>

06:25.634 --> 06:28.477
<i>But that mendacious minx
stole my map!</i>

06:28.554 --> 06:30.004
<i>I managed to catch her,</i>

06:30.081 --> 06:33.111
<i>but in the scuffle,
the map tore in half!</i>

06:33.366 --> 06:34.561
<i>Before I could get it back,</i>

06:34.638 --> 06:37.631
<i>we were attacked by the Glacier
Monster of the Klondike:</i>

06:37.708 --> 06:39.923
<i>A Woolly Mammoth!</i>

06:40.007 --> 06:41.368
<i>Goldie dodged his attack,</i>

06:41.445 --> 06:44.566
<i>but lost her half of the map
inside the teeth of that beast.</i>

06:44.643 --> 06:46.720
<i>We escaped with our lives!</i>

06:46.869 --> 06:49.220
<i>By being promptly frozen
in the ice.</i>

06:49.304 --> 06:52.738
<i>For five years I was stuck
in that cursed glacier,</i>

06:52.815 --> 06:56.403
<i>forced to stare at her
thievin' mug before we thawed.</i>

06:56.480 --> 06:58.860
<i>The Golden Lagoon
of White Agony Plains</i>

06:58.937 --> 07:02.366
<i>is the one treasure that greedy
gillie could never find...</i>

07:02.443 --> 07:05.878
<i>until Glomgold dug up
the Glacier Monster's skull.</i>

07:05.955 --> 07:08.852
That's the real reason
Goldie came to the gala.

07:08.999 --> 07:11.280
Launchpad, brakes!

07:16.023 --> 07:17.712
She's here.

07:20.156 --> 07:22.478
Hey, Moneybags, where's the
other half of the map?

07:22.555 --> 07:25.095
Where are Beakley and Webbigail?

07:26.646 --> 07:29.198
How did you let
that thief back into...

07:29.275 --> 07:31.509
You reprehensible recreant!

07:31.586 --> 07:33.639
Please stop flirting
in front of the children.

07:33.716 --> 07:35.984
Ooohh!

07:36.063 --> 07:37.296
Aah!

07:37.937 --> 07:41.357
Takes a fossil to find
a fossil, eh, Goldie?

07:41.434 --> 07:44.376
Says the man who still
wears spats and a top...

07:44.460 --> 07:45.529
hat.

07:45.606 --> 07:46.802
Give me my map!

07:46.879 --> 07:48.543
Get your pilfering paws
off my headpiece!

07:48.620 --> 07:49.876
I got the map!

07:52.168 --> 07:53.789
Fine. We team up.

07:53.866 --> 07:55.059
With our two halves of the map,

07:55.136 --> 07:56.875
we can finally find
the Golden Lagoon.

07:56.952 --> 07:59.544
And why should I trust you?

07:59.621 --> 08:02.014
Ohh, because it's gold.

08:02.091 --> 08:03.853
Because it's a treasure
you never found.

08:03.930 --> 08:05.814
And because
you're Scrooge McDuck.

08:05.934 --> 08:09.314
- You think you know me so well.
- You think you know me so well.

08:10.919 --> 08:13.338
Date! Date! Date!

08:13.415 --> 08:15.493
It's not a date!

08:22.125 --> 08:24.076
I'll take the pickaxe,
this lamp,

08:24.153 --> 08:25.672
rope, locator beacon,

08:25.749 --> 08:28.655
uh, and I'll need some
buckskin waterproof spats.

08:28.732 --> 08:30.503
We don't carry those.

08:30.580 --> 08:33.618
Fine, fine, I'll take a pair of
boots and your sharpest knife.

08:40.597 --> 08:41.921
- Uh, no food?
- No.

08:41.998 --> 08:44.169
Just one discount jug of mustard

08:44.246 --> 08:45.849
for these delicious
hors d'oeuvres.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.939
And whatever the lady needs.

08:48.283 --> 08:51.212
Uh, what lady?

08:51.304 --> 08:53.355
Goldie, you backstabbing...

08:53.432 --> 08:54.532
Scroogey...

08:57.969 --> 08:59.779
If we're going
to make it through this alive,

08:59.856 --> 09:01.562
we need to be able
to trust each other.

09:01.639 --> 09:02.867
Agreed.

09:02.999 --> 09:06.526
Now give me back the map
you stole from my bag.

09:11.039 --> 09:12.882
Take my girl, will ya?

09:12.959 --> 09:15.540
No one steals
from Flintheart Glomgold.

09:15.696 --> 09:18.674
Wait, are those
my teriyaki skewers?!

09:23.578 --> 09:27.743
Ahh, the Ice Caverns
of White Agony Plains. Ha!

09:27.821 --> 09:30.133
Sure brings back memories,
eh, Scrooge?

09:30.223 --> 09:33.135
No matter how hard
I try to forget.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.653
One of yours?

09:44.730 --> 09:46.073
You can't blame me for that.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.445
It was over a hundred years ago.

09:47.522 --> 09:48.804
We were different people then.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.652
Aye, that's what worries me.

09:50.729 --> 09:53.085
You've had a century's
worth of practice.

09:53.524 --> 09:54.993
What happened to you,
Moneybags?

09:55.070 --> 09:56.499
Domestic life turn you soft?

09:56.576 --> 09:58.263
What you'll never understand

09:58.371 --> 10:00.425
is that trust is
the cornerstone of...

10:00.492 --> 10:01.972
 Wait!

10:02.519 --> 10:03.955
Ooh!

10:04.246 --> 10:05.723
One of yours?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.440
Heh heh heh...

10:07.525 --> 10:10.172
You used to be
so much more fun.

10:11.990 --> 10:14.458
Hoo! Looks like it's
only big enough for one.

10:14.535 --> 10:16.576
I'll go down first
and send it back up to you.

10:16.653 --> 10:19.101
So you can get the jump on me?

10:19.240 --> 10:20.879
Fine, you go down first.

10:20.956 --> 10:22.839
Oh, so you can cut the rope?

10:22.916 --> 10:24.640
Well, what do you suggest?

10:26.020 --> 10:27.767
Would you move your elbow?

10:27.844 --> 10:31.483
Gladly, if you'd stop
sweating all over me.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.440
I'm only sweating because
I'm doing all the work!

10:34.517 --> 10:35.890
Oh, really? Oops.

10:36.579 --> 10:38.523
Aah!

10:41.148 --> 10:44.818
Stupid McDuck
and his stupid clever traps!

10:45.328 --> 10:46.341
Hah!

10:47.203 --> 10:50.556
Ha! A one-man elevator!

10:52.241 --> 10:53.296
Heh heh heh.

10:53.373 --> 10:55.335
So long, Scroogey.

10:55.412 --> 10:57.975
To the last,
I grapple with thee.

10:58.052 --> 11:01.189
From Hades' heart,
I... Oww!

11:01.461 --> 11:03.791
Eh, I'm sure
he got the gist of it.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.689
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

11:10.959 --> 11:12.026
Whoo!

11:12.101 --> 11:14.089
All that sweat must
have made you lose your grip.

11:14.159 --> 11:16.254
- For the last time, I...
- I get it.

11:16.322 --> 11:17.379
I make you sweat.

11:17.447 --> 11:18.856
I'll take that as a compliment.

11:18.933 --> 11:22.127
Ha. A gross,
salty compliment.

11:28.761 --> 11:30.803
The Rainbow Caves!

11:30.880 --> 11:32.720
We're nearly
at the Golden Lagoon!

11:38.468 --> 11:42.423
What? Just giving you a
little reading light is all.

11:54.074 --> 11:55.253
Got a light?

11:57.418 --> 11:58.852
What are you doing?

11:58.929 --> 12:00.534
I'm just lighting
this trail of gunpowder

12:00.611 --> 12:02.331
I've been leaving
behind us to distract you.

12:02.408 --> 12:04.252
What?! You're insane!

12:04.329 --> 12:06.107
A cave-in will
get us both killed!

12:06.184 --> 12:07.908
Oh, you'll stop the cave-in.

12:07.985 --> 12:09.725
You're Scrooge McDuck.

12:11.077 --> 12:13.745
Ooh!

12:13.822 --> 12:15.171
Mwah!

12:17.325 --> 12:18.982
Ohhh!

12:20.086 --> 12:21.093
Aah!

12:26.668 --> 12:28.896
Uh... heh heh.

12:33.174 --> 12:34.766
Sorry, Scrooge,

12:34.843 --> 12:36.834
but the Golden Lagoon is mine.

12:46.612 --> 12:48.866
Wait, what?! But how?

12:48.943 --> 12:51.412
I'm Scrooge McDuck!

13:06.807 --> 13:08.569
I don't understand it.

13:08.646 --> 13:13.889
The completed map says the path to
the falls should be right here.

13:17.217 --> 13:19.514
Ack, I thought
I'd never have to gaze

13:19.591 --> 13:21.693
upon this grievous glacier
again.

13:21.770 --> 13:25.022
Aww! Why don't you hop in the
ice to relive old times?

13:25.099 --> 13:28.295
We'll need to set up camp
until I figure this out.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.747
You're really
not gonna untie me?

13:40.824 --> 13:42.380
And spoil the entertainment?

13:42.457 --> 13:45.643
Come on. Why do you hold such
a grudge against me, Scrooge?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.725
You left me for dead
in the Gobi Desert,

13:47.802 --> 13:49.620
sold me to Portuguese pirates,

13:49.697 --> 13:51.704
threw me out of an airship
over the Himalayas...

13:51.781 --> 13:53.811
Like you didn't
love the challenge!

13:54.534 --> 13:56.808
Why, that biplane
was a disaster.

13:56.885 --> 13:59.109
Remember that deranged pilot.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.585
What was his name?

14:00.662 --> 14:01.765
Frogurt?

14:01.842 --> 14:02.973
Oh, Foghorn!

14:03.050 --> 14:05.103
With the weird glass eye
that turned out to be...

14:05.180 --> 14:07.000
- a marble!
- A marble!

14:09.611 --> 14:11.977
Oh, what happened, Scrooge?

14:12.054 --> 14:14.707
Why is this time
any worse than the others?

14:14.805 --> 14:17.369
You really don't know, do you?

14:18.730 --> 14:21.725
We spent five years here,
trapped in the ice

14:21.802 --> 14:24.586
<i>with only our hatred for
each other to keep us warm.</i>

14:24.795 --> 14:26.338
<i>But after half a decade</i>

14:26.415 --> 14:28.917
<i>stuck staring
at your thievin' face</i>

14:28.994 --> 14:30.871
<i>something changed.</i>

14:30.948 --> 14:34.132
<i>And that warmth
came from something else.</i>

14:53.147 --> 14:54.842
Huh?

14:59.947 --> 15:02.143
<i>You could have freed me.</i>

15:02.646 --> 15:04.150
But even after all that,

15:04.227 --> 15:07.342
you still abandoned me
and left me for dead.

15:07.419 --> 15:09.428
You were supposed to follow me!

15:09.505 --> 15:10.859
That was our whole thing!

15:10.936 --> 15:13.426
I was frozen in a giant glacier!

15:13.503 --> 15:15.486
You're Scrooge McDuck!

15:15.563 --> 15:18.125
Wha... That can't be
your reason for everything!

15:18.202 --> 15:19.690
Scroogey...

15:20.624 --> 15:23.526
It's the only reason
that matters.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.768
You loved gold
more than you loved me.

15:26.898 --> 15:29.361
And that's why you loved me.

15:29.592 --> 15:31.040
Uh...

15:36.719 --> 15:38.076
Ah, cork it, Nanook,

15:38.153 --> 15:39.903
I already gave you
half my salmon puffs.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.523
That's no bear.

15:46.891 --> 15:50.731
It sounds like a... waterfall!

15:50.897 --> 15:53.077
We always believed
this was a dead end.

15:53.154 --> 15:55.851
But years of erosion
must have thinned the walls!

15:55.928 --> 15:57.074
Nanook!

16:00.094 --> 16:01.290
Ohh!

16:01.415 --> 16:04.073
Pure liquid gold!

16:06.228 --> 16:07.869
Whoo ha ha!

16:07.946 --> 16:11.031
The Golden Lagoon
of White Agony Plains!

16:11.108 --> 16:12.786
We finally found it!

16:12.863 --> 16:14.784
Yes, we did!

16:19.181 --> 16:20.872
That's right, Scrooge,

16:20.949 --> 16:24.260
we were workin' together
this whole time!

16:31.596 --> 16:32.938
Goldie!

16:35.102 --> 16:38.010
Annnd backstabbed.

16:39.282 --> 16:40.678
Once again, Scrooge,

16:40.755 --> 16:43.580
you see there is nothing
you can possess that I cannot...

16:43.696 --> 16:46.777
I'm sorry, is that a sack
of Swedish meatballs?

16:47.151 --> 16:49.601
That's it. Next gala, no buffet.

16:49.678 --> 16:50.945
What are you doing here?

16:51.022 --> 16:52.578
I told you I was handling it!

16:52.655 --> 16:54.267
And I was handling Scrooge!

16:54.344 --> 16:56.786
I mean, I almost had him
with that one-man elevator!

16:56.863 --> 17:00.120
You idiot, I was in
that one-man elevator, too.

17:00.618 --> 17:04.304
What were you doing in a
one-person elevator with Scrooge?!

17:04.381 --> 17:06.255
How many times
do I have to tell you?

17:06.332 --> 17:08.633
We are not a thing.

17:08.724 --> 17:13.190
Ah, classic GlomGoldie repartee.

17:13.930 --> 17:16.481
Wait, how did this happen?

17:16.558 --> 17:18.890
Oh, you mean, the greatest
love story of all time?

17:18.967 --> 17:21.156
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

17:21.233 --> 17:23.385
Oh! It was yesterday.

17:23.462 --> 17:25.222
Exactly.

17:25.625 --> 17:28.990
<i>I arrived at the party
in my finest finery.</i>

17:29.100 --> 17:31.406
<i>When we locked eyes it was as if</i>

17:31.483 --> 17:34.951
<i>we were struck by an arrow
from Eros himself.</i>

17:35.082 --> 17:41.381
<i>Yes, it was the beginning of
a love written in the stars.</i>

17:41.499 --> 17:43.018
You know we were there

17:43.095 --> 17:45.008
and literally
none of that happened.

17:45.087 --> 17:46.823
We teamed up to con you
out of the map

17:46.900 --> 17:48.237
so that you'd find
the treasure for us.

17:48.314 --> 17:49.354
End of story.

17:49.431 --> 17:50.805
We had a deal.

17:50.882 --> 17:52.901
I untied you from a bear!

17:52.978 --> 17:54.455
How could you do this to me?

17:54.532 --> 17:56.393
Because I'm Goldie O'Gilt.

17:56.470 --> 17:59.169
Funny.
Somehow I keep forgetting.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.911
As much as I enjoy watching this
hilarious scene of rejection,

18:02.988 --> 18:04.307
I'd really love to destroy you

18:04.384 --> 18:06.563
before our dinner reservation
at 6:00.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.263
We'll see about that!

18:15.578 --> 18:17.126
Yah!

18:20.267 --> 18:21.870
Nice parry!

18:23.845 --> 18:25.079
Thanks.

18:27.491 --> 18:29.162
But let the lady lead.

18:29.446 --> 18:31.680
Hey! I have a pickaxe, too!

18:31.757 --> 18:32.900
Hah!

18:33.387 --> 18:34.570
Aah!

18:36.329 --> 18:37.783
Whoa! Uh!

18:38.001 --> 18:39.118
- Oh!
- Hah!

18:39.186 --> 18:40.280
Aah!

18:52.727 --> 18:54.142
Aah!

19:00.061 --> 19:01.061
Aha!

19:03.496 --> 19:07.388
Flintheart Glomgold will
not be a third wheel!

19:10.582 --> 19:11.597
What?!

19:11.698 --> 19:13.256
Oh, Scrooge!

19:14.806 --> 19:16.902
- Goldie!
- Aaaah!

19:24.316 --> 19:25.838
Ohh!

19:26.598 --> 19:28.142
Help me, Scroogey!

19:28.219 --> 19:31.116
I'm stuck at the bottom
of the boilin' lagoon!

19:31.193 --> 19:33.034
Ha ha ha! Fooled ya!

19:33.111 --> 19:36.085
Look who's ended up
with Goldie <i> and</i> the gold!

19:36.162 --> 19:37.855
Classic GlomGoldie-gold!

19:37.932 --> 19:39.269
Aw, Goldie.

19:39.371 --> 19:41.170
I was so busy looking
for treasure,

19:41.247 --> 19:43.996
I ignored the one
staring me in the face.

19:44.119 --> 19:46.109
And stabbing me in the back.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.692
Goodbye, sweet princess.

19:48.769 --> 19:52.092
If I had to choose between
lovin' you and killin' him,

19:52.169 --> 19:53.582
it was kind of a no-brainer.

19:53.713 --> 19:55.126
When I pull this lever,

19:55.203 --> 19:57.783
liquid hot gold will
spew out of this derrick,

19:57.884 --> 20:00.634
and I will complete
the Glomgold trifecta:

20:00.711 --> 20:03.149
Stealin' your girlfriend,
endin' you,

20:03.226 --> 20:06.433
and becomin' the richest duck
in the world!

20:09.780 --> 20:12.698
Oh, pity you're not alive
to witness this, sweetums.

20:12.775 --> 20:14.732
I know how much you would
have wanted this for me.

20:14.809 --> 20:16.299
Can we wrap this up already?

20:16.376 --> 20:18.053
Fair enough. Three, two, one,

20:18.130 --> 20:19.462
Glom-Go!

20:21.161 --> 20:22.667
What's happenin'?!

20:23.501 --> 20:26.659
Stupid cheap Glomgold
brand derricks!

20:27.209 --> 20:28.245
What?!

20:28.322 --> 20:30.971
What?! What?! What?!
What?! What?!

20:36.557 --> 20:38.175
What?! Where'd she go?!

20:38.252 --> 20:40.083
Hoodleehoo, boys!

20:42.336 --> 20:43.729
Ahh!

20:44.260 --> 20:46.072
But... how?

20:46.149 --> 20:48.575
She should have been
burnt to a crisp!

20:50.180 --> 20:51.612
Don't worry!

20:51.689 --> 20:53.989
At least you have each other!

20:54.066 --> 20:58.205
The Eye of Demogorgon
makes you impervious to burns!

20:58.282 --> 21:00.864
She knew the whole time!

21:03.791 --> 21:07.517
Ohh! That two-timin',
backstabbin' thief!

21:07.594 --> 21:10.227
Get back here with my gold!

21:10.304 --> 21:12.770
Isn't she fantastic?

21:17.731 --> 21:20.173
Oooooh!

21:20.384 --> 21:22.699
Oooh-hoo-hooo!

21:22.776 --> 21:27.386
Ooh! Tell us about your date
with your girlfriend!

21:27.463 --> 21:30.824
Yeah, and your marriage and your
baby in your baby carriage!

21:30.901 --> 21:32.170
Ooh, and if we get a new aunt,

21:32.247 --> 21:33.819
will she give us lots
of fancy presents?

21:33.896 --> 21:35.146
Wait. She's not
in the will, is she?

21:35.214 --> 21:36.770
Oh, grow up!

21:49.897 --> 21:52.211
"Next time you need
some gold in your life,

21:52.288 --> 21:54.383
come find me."
