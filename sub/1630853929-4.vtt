But before
their fame and renown,

00:08.704 --> 00:11.750
most started out
with only hopes and dreams.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.101
And I'm like, "Oh, my God.
He's gonna make the Olympics."

00:14.275 --> 00:15.754

you know, I'd be like,

00:15.928 --> 00:16.973
"Come on, push yourself.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.127
"You guys need to go
chase your dreams."

00:40.301 --> 00:41.128
You changed
the course of my life,

In college, um,

is she to have

03:09.101 --> 03:10.059

So, what's the style
that we're going for?

06:19.988 --> 06:22.817
Um, I think that the space
needs to evolve

06:22.991 --> 06:24.862
just like our family
has evolved.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.691

and dining room combo

07:13.520 --> 07:15.957

and great floors,

07:16.131 --> 07:17.654

07:17.828 --> 07:19.700

out of the 1990s.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.919

living area

07:22.093 --> 07:25.183
with an eclectic mix of
new furniture, new lighting,

07:25.357 --> 07:28.317
a larger dining room table,
and plenty of accent pieces.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.058
We'll relocate the family photos

07:30.188 --> 07:32.060
so we can bring some color
into the living area,

07:32.190 --> 07:35.324

fireplace a beautiful facelift.

07:44.812 --> 07:47.336
She loves blue.
She loves, um, creams.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.946
I think also, in general,

07:49.120 --> 07:51.253
the whole house,
it feels really kind of

07:51.427 --> 07:53.429
dark and needs, like,

07:53.603 --> 07:56.301
some light and bright,
which is also my mom.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.521
She's, like, so bubbly and fun.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.567
SABRINA:
The layout of the kitchen
is really nice,

08:00.741 --> 08:01.959
but the whole space
needs to be newer

08:02.133 --> 08:04.353
and in the color palette
that Holli really loves.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.747
What's going
on with this pantry?

08:06.921 --> 08:09.010
So, I think they put that there

08:09.184 --> 08:12.187
'cause that's the only place
they thought they could put one?

08:12.361 --> 08:13.493
I could tell right away

08:13.667 --> 08:15.756
that this was
a do-it-yourself project.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.235
They just put a hole
in the wall?

08:17.409 --> 08:18.759
So they just put a hole
in the wall?

08:18.933 --> 08:20.151
Yeah, and on the other side,
in the laundry room,

08:20.325 --> 08:21.718
there's a big box.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.372
And you're like
"Why is there a box?"

08:23.546 --> 08:24.460
-'Cause it's a pantry.
-You're kidding me.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.244
There's a cut out here
for, like,

08:26.418 --> 08:27.594
the fridge
that you had in college.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.596
-Yes.
-Why do we have two fridges?

08:29.770 --> 08:31.206
-Lots of parties.
-Really?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.469
ANNALEIGH: Lots of people
over all the time.

08:33.643 --> 08:36.732
ROB:
This single pantry cabinet
just does not belong here.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.866
So I can't wait to get rid of it

08:39.039 --> 08:42.390
and give Holli some
storage space somewhere else.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.133
Tell me what's going on
with this.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.396
ANNALEIGH:
Okay, so I thought
we needed a family crest

08:47.570 --> 08:50.530
on the wall, so I hand-painted

08:50.704 --> 08:51.966
what I believe to be
our family crest.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.924
-That's pretty good.
-I love that.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.230
-ANNALEIGH: Thank you.
-You did such a good job. Okay.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.840
But are you okay
with all of this going away?

08:57.014 --> 08:58.363
Oh, we can totally take it away.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.495
If we feel like
we need the crest--

08:59.626 --> 09:01.628
'cause I know
my parents love it--

09:01.802 --> 09:03.064
maybe I can, like, repaint it
for them and we can frame it.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.892
SABRINA:
Okay. Okay.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.807
We'll need to start
with a full gut job,

09:06.937 --> 09:09.505
including taking out that
DIY pantry and mini fridge.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.203
We'll be sure to save
the Swanson family crest

09:12.377 --> 09:14.858
so it can be repurposed
for Annaleigh's parents.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.034
We'll install
modern gray cabinets,

09:17.165 --> 09:19.646
including a beautiful
large pantry where it belongs,

09:19.820 --> 09:22.083
and an island in Holli's
favorite blue

09:22.257 --> 09:23.650
to make it really pop.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.434
Then, we'll finish off
the kitchen

09:25.608 --> 09:27.001
with beautiful white
quartz countertops

09:27.175 --> 09:29.743
to brighten everything up.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.483
ANNALEIGH:
Since my grandma passed away,

09:31.658 --> 09:34.008
my mom really has become
the matriarch.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.967
My grandma, she was
an incredible entertainer.

09:37.141 --> 09:40.971
And I'm just super excited for
my mom to have a cozier, warmer,

09:41.145 --> 09:43.104
brighter space to have all of
our family and friends over.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.106
All right.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.108
SABRINA:
So, this used to be the garage?

09:47.282 --> 09:48.675
-ANNALEIGH: This was the garage.
-ROB: This is a big space.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.502
SABRINA:
This family room

09:50.677 --> 09:51.852
should be the party room,
but right now,

09:52.026 --> 09:53.593
there's definitely
no party going on.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.638
So wait, this is
where everybody hangs out,

09:55.769 --> 09:57.335
-but we only have
seating for five?
-ANNALEIGH: Exactly.

09:57.509 --> 09:58.685
There's not enough seating.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.512
There's a very large
beanbag in the middle.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.383
SABRINA: Oh, right.
I forgot about the beanbag.

10:01.557 --> 10:02.863
ANNALEIGH:
Yes, the beanbag.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.560
There's an old beanbag
on the floor.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.910
The TV's gone
because it was broken.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.870
The brown tile
makes the space feel cold.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.654
I need to get this place
back on track.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.438
Sabrina, what about this space?

10:13.569 --> 10:16.137
Do you think we could
do something over here?

10:16.311 --> 10:18.052
-I want to get
more seating here.
-Right.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.315
SABRINA:
So if we just solely
keep this seating,

10:20.489 --> 10:21.925
we can make that,
like, an entertaining bar.

10:22.099 --> 10:24.101
Sabrina's ideas are amazing.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.582
I mean, who doesn't
want a beverage center?

10:26.756 --> 10:27.670
That door leads to the backyard,

10:27.844 --> 10:29.454
so that's sort of perfect.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.847
-Great.
-Awesome.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.762
SABRINA:
Family rooms are so fun

10:32.936 --> 10:34.155
because they're
where everyone gathers.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.026
And for Holli's,

10:36.200 --> 10:37.941
I'm going to triple
the amount of seating

10:38.115 --> 10:40.683
with a huge comfy sectional
and bar seating for four.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.467
I'll bring in a media console

10:42.598 --> 10:44.687
that doubles as a modern
electric fireplace

10:44.861 --> 10:46.776
to warm up
this converted garage.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.692
And I'll top it
with a 83-inch TV,

10:49.823 --> 10:51.955
which will be perfect
for watching the big game.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.566
Then, I'll brighten
everything up with new paint,

10:54.741 --> 10:56.830
lighting and upgraded flooring.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.962
And to replace
that DIY mini fridge,

10:59.136 --> 11:01.573
we'll create a beautiful
beverage station

11:01.748 --> 11:03.706
that will include
a brand-new refrigerator

11:03.837 --> 11:06.796
and ice maker for all of
their future viewing parties.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.537
But first, we need to get
everything out.

11:08.711 --> 11:11.105

17 water bottles in here.

this great privilege

24:08.055 --> 24:11.537
that I am allowed to take
a little design trip with you?

24:11.711 --> 24:13.408
I just used the app,

-Really?
-Absolutely.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.642
I like that one. That's pretty.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.253
It's got, like, a little bit
of pearl undertone...

24:32.427 --> 24:34.864
Put it up next to it. Let's see.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.605
-You see that?
-That's nice.

24:36.779 --> 24:37.998
I feel like we need
a little bit more pizzazz.

Man, I knew it wasn't
going to be this easy.

-Okay.
-No, there are options
for a reason.

-What about this guy?
-I mean, that looks
exactly like that one.

24:49.139 --> 24:51.794
-Except it's gray.
-This has tons of brown in it.

24:51.968 --> 24:54.188
This has lots
of gray undertones.

-Sabrina?
-Yes.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.586
A little bit of blue,

25:00.760 --> 25:03.153
a little bit of gray,
and mostly white.

25:03.327 --> 25:05.678
I love that.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.027
I think it's got
a little personality.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.420
It's got that
classic Carrara feel,

25:09.595 --> 25:11.248
but the low maintenance
of the quartz.

25:11.422 --> 25:14.600

SABRINA:
Annaleigh's mom, Holli,
loves to entertain,

but the seating in her family
room was lackluster at best.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.790
It only had
couch seating for five

25:30.964 --> 25:33.140
and an old beanbag
center stage.

25:33.270 --> 25:36.622
So I'm going to bring the party
to Denver with seating for 15,

25:36.796 --> 25:38.798

some bar-style seating

25:38.972 --> 25:40.713
and tables behind the couch

this morning.

25:53.377 --> 25:56.946
And the first one was ready
to go in about an hour.

The angle that you have
on the wall right now...

-Are they all 45?
-Well, that's what I was
gonna ask you.

26:19.403 --> 26:21.057
They're not.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.494
They're not all 45s,

26:23.669 --> 26:25.018
with the tape
and that whole thing?

26:25.192 --> 26:27.760
Maybe in the tape,
but not in the real design.

you get to levels of success

39:44.294 --> 39:45.644
and you can do a lot of things,

39:45.818 --> 39:47.689
but to be able to put
your heart in it, too.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.779
She put her whole heart and soul
into this for you guys,

39:50.910 --> 39:53.216
and I hope it just shows you
a little piece

39:53.391 --> 39:55.044
of how much she loves you.

39:55.218 --> 39:57.699
-CHRIS: Yes.
-Thank you, baby.
-I love you guys.

39:57.873 --> 39:59.353
-I love you.
-I love you, guys.

39:59.527 --> 40:02.269
Oh, I love a family hug.
Yes!

40:02.443 --> 40:03.879
You know, I was saying earlier

40:04.053 --> 40:06.578
that I feel like
you need to be celebrated

40:06.752 --> 40:08.362
because you did just retire,
and you're so amazing.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.885
Oh, thank you.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.931
And so,
that's what we're going to do.

40:12.105 --> 40:14.107
ANNALEIGH:
We're gonna to celebrate you!

40:14.281 --> 40:15.500
NISCHELLE:
We're going to celebrate you.
Look, everybody's here.

40:15.674 --> 40:18.111
[overlapping chatter]

40:18.285 --> 40:20.287
-[laughter]
-We brought the party!

40:20.461 --> 40:21.897
Come on in.

40:22.071 --> 40:24.378
NISCHELLE:
It's a party!

40:24.552 --> 40:26.641
Come on in, guys.
Check it out.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.904
ANNALEIGH:
It feels special

40:29.078 --> 40:32.168
and such a relief

40:32.342 --> 40:34.344
to sort of be at the end
of this journey.

40:34.519 --> 40:35.433
ANNALEIGH:
Look, it's your own chair.

40:35.607 --> 40:36.912
NISCHELLE:
It fits you perfectly.

40:37.086 --> 40:38.697
ANNALEIGH:
Oh, yes!

40:38.827 --> 40:40.699
I'm so grateful
that I got to give my parents

40:40.873 --> 40:43.136
this beautiful gift,

40:43.310 --> 40:45.181
and I'm just excited to

40:45.355 --> 40:46.661
see them share this with
all the people that they love.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.097
[overlapping chattering]

40:50.012 --> 40:52.188
You know, this house has
a lot of history for our family.

40:52.362 --> 40:53.320
It has been in the family

40:53.494 --> 40:55.104
for 50 years,
and I feel like

40:55.278 --> 40:58.194
today was the beginning
of a new chapter,

40:58.368 --> 41:00.980
one that's filled with
even more love and light.

41:01.154 --> 41:04.679
Hey, Mom, we have
a little surprise for you.

41:04.853 --> 41:06.333
You know, my mom
has been a PE teacher

41:06.507 --> 41:08.335
for the last 30 years,

41:08.509 --> 41:10.772
and her classroom is the gym.

41:10.946 --> 41:13.079
Of course, it took 30 years
for them to replace the carpet,

41:13.253 --> 41:15.081
so we want to present you

41:15.211 --> 41:18.258
-with a little piece
of the school.
-[laughter]

41:18.432 --> 41:19.781
All the sweat,

41:19.955 --> 41:21.609
all the love that went in
on this floor.

41:21.783 --> 41:23.829
And we want to make sure
that you remember...

41:24.003 --> 41:25.961
-Thank you.
-...all the years
that you gave to kids.

41:26.135 --> 41:27.659
ANNALEIGH:
The fact that they were able

41:27.833 --> 41:29.574
to save a piece of that carpet,
I think is just

41:29.748 --> 41:31.576
a magical momento.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.229
I mean, it's hilarious

41:33.403 --> 41:36.929
and also so heartfelt
at the same time.

41:37.103 --> 41:39.279
[cheering and applause]

41:39.453 --> 41:41.934
Saving a spot, right here.

41:42.108 --> 41:43.762
[laughing]

41:43.936 --> 41:45.938
Yes, there we go!

41:46.112 --> 41:47.461
To Holli!

41:47.592 --> 41:49.202
HOLLI:
We were talking about,

41:49.376 --> 41:51.552
this is gonna be so beautiful

41:51.726 --> 41:53.119
and the kids won't mess it up.

41:53.249 --> 41:54.599
They won't be here
to throw parties...

41:54.773 --> 41:56.252
[laughing]
...unless we're here.

41:56.426 --> 41:58.777
So we're gonna keep it
really nice

41:58.907 --> 42:00.605
and, yeah, this is
a new chapter in our life.

42:00.779 --> 42:02.607
-Hey, how do you guys feel?
-I love it.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.391
-You love it?
-It's amazing.
-Yes.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.132
-Yeah?
-Thank you so much.

42:06.262 --> 42:07.481
-Simply amazing.
-You're so welcome. I love you.

42:07.655 --> 42:08.961
I'm so glad we got to do this

42:09.135 --> 42:10.832
-for you guys.
-CHRIS: Thank you for doing it.

42:11.006 --> 42:13.008
HOLLI:
I'm just gonna
tell you something.

42:13.139 --> 42:15.924
You really make it life when
your friends become your family

42:16.055 --> 42:17.709
and when your family
are your best friends.

42:17.839 --> 42:20.146
-Oh, Mom.
-That's all you can ask for.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.148
-You're my best friend, baby,
I love you so much.
-I love you, too.

42:22.322 --> 42:24.193
-I love you so much.
-Thank you, you're
my best friend, too.

42:24.367 --> 42:25.630
I love you.
And now we have new friends.

42:25.804 --> 42:27.632
-Yes, you do.
-Friends.

42:27.806 --> 42:30.199
And there's so much joy
in this house today.

42:30.373 --> 42:31.853
And that's the way
it's supposed to be,

42:32.027 --> 42:33.463
Ain't that right, Jack?

42:33.638 --> 42:34.856
Jack, you want to bring us
some popcorn?

42:35.030 --> 42:36.292
-Jack, come on in here.
-Come on.
