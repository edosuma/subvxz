00:00.880 --> 00:02.245
(Male announcer) Previously
on  Hell's Kitchen...

00:02.850 --> 00:04.351
Chef Ramsay challenged the chefs...

00:04.352 --> 00:05.983
(Gordon) Last ten minutes!

00:05.984 --> 00:07.851
(Announcer) To be creative
within certain time constraints.

00:07.852 --> 00:09.483
(Gordon) 90 seconds to go!

00:09.484 --> 00:11.251
(Announcer) And although
Jennifer lacked confidence...

00:11.252 --> 00:12.817
No way is this gonna be ready.

00:12.818 --> 00:15.016
It's probably the worst dish
I ever made in my life.

00:15.017 --> 00:16.818
(Announcer) Her 30-minute
seared lamb was impressive.

00:16.819 --> 00:18.717
The lamb's delicious. Good job.

00:18.718 --> 00:21.317
(Announcer) But Paul's 20-minute
Pan-roasted sea bass...

00:21.318 --> 00:22.783
It's got finesse.

00:22.784 --> 00:24.118
(Announcer) And Will's
10-minute lemon prawns...

00:24.119 --> 00:25.550
It's cooked beautifully.

00:25.551 --> 00:26.551
(Announcer) Clinched the
victory for the Blue Team.

00:26.552 --> 00:29.217
You win the challenge.

00:29.218 --> 00:30.916
(Announcer) Then at the
first ever   Hell's Kitchen

00:30.917 --> 00:32.116
vip charity dinner...

00:32.116 --> 00:33.582
I'm a say a prayer for us.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.049
We need a lot of prayers.

00:35.050 --> 00:36.982
(Announcer) Each chef was
responsible for two courses.

00:36.983 --> 00:38.584
Elizabeth, you're in charge.
This is your moment.

00:38.585 --> 00:39.917
Yes, chef.

00:39.918 --> 00:41.551
(Announcer) Elizabeth had problems leading.

00:41.552 --> 00:43.183
You're five minutes too early.

00:43.184 --> 00:46.450
I'll let them rest right now.
They're ready perfectly now.

00:46.451 --> 00:47.984
(Announcer) Jennifer had
problems with the Elise.

00:47.985 --> 00:50.550
[Bleep] What the hell
is wrong with you guys?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.782
Trying to sabotage me?

00:51.783 --> 00:53.118
(Announcer) And Will's
10-minute lemon prawns...

00:53.119 --> 00:54.483
Back off.

00:54.484 --> 00:56.549
(Announcer) And Elise had
problems with everybody.

00:56.550 --> 00:57.716
Let's go! More prawns.

00:57.717 --> 00:59.384
We already made 'em wait long enough.

00:59.385 --> 01:01.083
Wipe the rims, please.

01:01.084 --> 01:02.982
(Announcer) The Blue Team was united...

01:02.983 --> 01:04.581
Paul, is that what you want?
Everything looks good.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.082
(Announcer) And won convincingly...

01:06.083 --> 01:07.549
Congratulations. Thank you, chef.

01:07.550 --> 01:09.051
(Announcer) And were
rewarded with black jackets.

01:09.052 --> 01:10.450
Well done.

01:10.451 --> 01:11.982
(Announcer) The Red Team
continued to bicker...

01:11.983 --> 01:13.582
Can you lead a team? Can you listen?

01:13.583 --> 01:14.649
Why don't you shut up for five seconds?

01:14.650 --> 01:15.916
(Elise)   I'm not gonna shut up,

01:15.917 --> 01:17.051
'cause I'm fighting for my life.

01:17.052 --> 01:19.617
Chef, this is exactly what happens all day.

01:19.618 --> 01:21.816
(Announcer) But in the end,
both Jennifer and Elise

01:21.817 --> 01:22.918
received their coveted black jackets.

01:22.919 --> 01:24.717
Oh! Back in line.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.083
Thank you, chef!

01:26.084 --> 01:27.584
(Announcer) And in spite
of a passionate plea...

01:27.585 --> 01:29.350
Please give me another shot, chef.

01:29.351 --> 01:31.383
(Announcer) It was... Elizabeth.

01:31.384 --> 01:33.118
(Announcer) Whose dream
of becoming head chef

01:33.119 --> 01:36.017
at BLT Steak in New York City...

01:36.018 --> 01:39.117
Went up in flames.

of  Hell's Kitchen

02:44.784 --> 02:46.051
You're now one team.

02:46.052 --> 02:48.383
Oh, my God.

02:48.384 --> 02:49.382
Now get out of here.

02:49.383 --> 02:50.384
Have a good night, chef.

02:50.385 --> 02:52.250
Oh, my God.

02:52.251 --> 02:53.317
This is huge.

02:53.318 --> 02:55.018
Black jackets is a huge accomplishment.

02:55.019 --> 02:56.683
It's like winning without winning.

02:56.684 --> 03:00.517
I always felt that I was good
enough for a black jacket.

03:00.518 --> 03:03.050
[Cheering]

03:03.051 --> 03:05.417
Yeah! Yeah, boy!

03:05.418 --> 03:08.083
I never worked with Elise, but
now that we're on one team,

03:08.084 --> 03:11.150
I Hope that all the [Bleep] that
happened in the red kitchen

03:11.151 --> 03:13.150
dies with the red kitchen.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.718
No hard feelings. One team. Nothing.

03:14.719 --> 03:16.583
Down to the [Bleep] wire.

03:16.584 --> 03:17.918
Yeah, guys, for real. The [Bleep]...

03:17.919 --> 03:20.050
Is done. It better be done.

03:20.051 --> 03:21.650
Yeah, we got to hold it down.

03:21.651 --> 03:24.650
I don't know what's gonna
happen when this team collides.

03:24.651 --> 03:26.650
The guys on the Blue Team hate the drama

03:26.651 --> 03:29.317
and I don't think being in
a black jacket is gonna

03:29.318 --> 03:30.617
help Elise's attitude.

03:30.618 --> 03:32.018
I think it's gonna make it worse.

03:32.019 --> 03:33.883
Black coats, black final five.

03:33.884 --> 03:34.951
(All) Final five!

03:34.952 --> 03:36.383
Hoorah.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.918
It's on.

03:42.351 --> 03:43.884
(Announcer) After a night of celebration,

03:43.885 --> 03:46.050
the final five are eager to tackle

03:46.051 --> 03:48.383
whatever chef Ramsay has in store for them.

03:48.384 --> 03:51.117
(Gordon)   wow.   chefs in black.

03:51.118 --> 03:54.517
Okay, your first individual challenge

03:54.518 --> 03:57.117
is all about presentation.

03:57.118 --> 03:58.917
You'll be working with

03:58.918 --> 04:02.383
ugly foods.

04:02.384 --> 04:04.782
There's foods like meatloaf,
who, let's be honest,

04:04.783 --> 04:06.716
we have to sort of   work really hard

04:06.717 --> 04:08.251
to transform them into something stunning.

04:08.252 --> 04:11.617
Now, Andy and Scott are
in the dining room

04:11.618 --> 04:13.083
moving plates around.

04:13.084 --> 04:15.950
There are five possibilities.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.350
When I say, "go..."

04:17.351 --> 04:18.350
Oh, my God.

04:18.351 --> 04:20.517
Run and grab the plates

04:20.517 --> 04:21.517
with the name of the dish   that you want.

04:21.519 --> 04:22.683
Oh, my God.

04:22.684 --> 04:24.750
(Gordon)   on your Marks,

04:24.751 --> 04:27.083
set...

04:27.084 --> 04:30.617
Go!

04:30.618 --> 04:32.683
I have to make it to that eggplant parmesan

04:32.684 --> 04:33.684
no matter what.

04:33.685 --> 04:35.217
I Will knock somebody down

04:35.218 --> 04:36.884
and drag 'em down the steps before they get

04:36.885 --> 04:38.450
to that eggplant before me.

04:38.451 --> 04:39.584
Get off me! Get off me!

04:39.585 --> 04:41.817
Jeez, I'm not gonna make it up there.

04:41.818 --> 04:43.482
Everybody already beat me to the stairs.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.084
So instead of turning upstairs
into a wrestling arena...

04:45.085 --> 04:46.783
[Bleep]

04:46.784 --> 04:48.218
I took a leisurely stroll
to the back of the room

04:48.219 --> 04:50.583
and grabbed the chicken and dumplings.

04:50.584 --> 04:52.518
Yeah, I was pissed that I
didn't get the eggplant,

04:52.519 --> 04:54.517
but unfortunately Elise got it.

04:54.518 --> 04:55.783
Yes!

04:55.784 --> 04:57.618
(Paul) My backup was gonna be the lasagna,

04:57.619 --> 04:59.617
but Jenn grabbed it.

04:59.618 --> 05:00.884
We was killing the game.

05:00.885 --> 05:03.050
(Paul) So I got to make tuna casserole.

05:03.051 --> 05:04.983
Okay, little miss speedy knickers,

05:04.984 --> 05:06.916
did you push Paul   down the stairs?

05:06.917 --> 05:08.218
Paul tried to jump over me

05:08.219 --> 05:10.050
and I told him, "get back."

05:10.051 --> 05:11.818
(Gordon)   wow.   that's right.

05:11.819 --> 05:15.650
Okay, you have 50 minutes   to transform

05:15.651 --> 05:16.951
those ugly dishes into something

05:16.952 --> 05:19.617
that look phenomenal   and taste delicious.

05:19.618 --> 05:21.583
And your time starts...

05:21.584 --> 05:22.950
Now.   off you go.

05:22.951 --> 05:24.917
Don't run me over. Right here.

05:24.918 --> 05:27.250
(Announcer) For their first
individual challenge,

05:27.251 --> 05:29.917
chef Ramsay is testing the
chefs' presentation skills,

05:29.918 --> 05:33.517
as they attempt to transform
a classic comfort food dish

05:33.518 --> 05:35.717
into something beautiful and delicious.

05:35.718 --> 05:37.418
I've never made tuna casserole before.

05:37.419 --> 05:39.017
That's a rough one, Paulie.

05:39.018 --> 05:41.051
(Will)   anybody have butter
out   that they're not using?

05:41.052 --> 05:43.517
Yeah.

05:43.518 --> 05:45.449
(Will) For me, meatloaf is amazing.

05:45.450 --> 05:46.718
If I was ever on death row,

05:46.719 --> 05:50.450
my last meal would be my mother's meatloaf.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.649
(Tommy)   I like where
your head's at,   buddy.

05:51.650 --> 05:52.716
Thank you, Tommy.

05:52.717 --> 05:54.016
20 minutes to go. Yes, chef.

05:54.017 --> 05:55.684
(Will)   20 minutes left, chef.

05:55.685 --> 05:57.950
Nosy?

05:57.951 --> 05:59.383
Just was looking.

05:59.384 --> 06:01.717
Elise is a pain in the ass,
man, with everything.

06:01.718 --> 06:04.517
It was just, like, every seven seconds

06:04.518 --> 06:05.849
I looked over, she had nine pans

06:05.850 --> 06:07.018
working for one dish.

06:07.019 --> 06:09.350
Elise, you made eggplant parm.

06:09.351 --> 06:12.117
It's not rocket science, man.
You don't need nine pans out.

06:12.118 --> 06:14.317
I need another Pan.

06:14.318 --> 06:16.383
Five minutes to go!

06:16.384 --> 06:17.650
Chef.

06:17.651 --> 06:18.751
I got to get moving here.

06:18.752 --> 06:21.717
[Bleep] You, dumplings.

06:21.718 --> 06:23.383
Behind, behind, behind. Mm-hmm.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.651
(Gordon)   30 seconds to go!

06:24.652 --> 06:27.083
Come on!

06:27.084 --> 06:28.117
Ah!

06:28.118 --> 06:31.883
Five, four, three, two, one.

06:31.884 --> 06:34.283
And serve.

06:34.284 --> 06:36.450
Right. Listen carefully.

06:36.451 --> 06:38.851
For your first individual
challenge, I have brought in

06:38.852 --> 06:41.617
the most amazing esteemed
panel of judges.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.050
Oh, my God.

06:43.051 --> 06:44.482
Let's give a round of applause
for our judges, please.

06:44.483 --> 06:45.684
[Applause] Welcome.

06:45.685 --> 06:48.250
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

06:48.251 --> 06:52.083
First, Lesley Bargar Suter,
dine editor of  L.A. magazine.

06:52.084 --> 06:54.517
Susie Heller,   author of cookbooks.

06:54.518 --> 06:55.618
She's worked with Julia Childs.

06:55.619 --> 06:57.117
Amazing.

06:57.118 --> 06:59.450
(Gordon)  Valerie Aikman-Smith,
food stylist,

06:59.451 --> 07:01.583
on some of Hollywood's biggest movies.

07:01.584 --> 07:04.717
Deborah Jones, award-winning
food photographer.

07:04.718 --> 07:06.817
Phenomenal chef Eric Greenspan,

07:06.818 --> 07:10.818
executive chef, owner of
the foundry on Melrose.

07:12.551 --> 07:14.083
Are you ready? (All) Yes, chef.

07:14.084 --> 07:16.650
Let's start off with Tommy.

07:16.651 --> 07:18.350
This is impossible to carry.

07:18.351 --> 07:21.550
(Announcer) Each judge Will rate the
dishes on a scale of one to ten.

07:21.551 --> 07:22.951
Looks like he's walking with a bomb.

07:22.952 --> 07:24.383
There we are.

07:24.384 --> 07:26.251
(Announcer) First, they Will
score it on presentation,

07:26.252 --> 07:29.183
and then they Will score it on taste.

07:29.184 --> 07:32.583
A perfect score is 100 points.

07:32.584 --> 07:33.816
I had to put a visually appealing twist

07:33.817 --> 07:35.318
on a traditional chicken and dumpling.

07:35.319 --> 07:38.483
(Will)   20 minutes left, chef.

07:38.484 --> 07:42.617
Which I petaled out to
resemble a water Lily.

07:42.618 --> 07:43.682
(Gordon)   thank you.

07:43.683 --> 07:44.749
Lesley, did it float your boat?

07:44.750 --> 07:46.216
It's beautiful, great color.

07:46.217 --> 07:47.351
I think it's a lovely dish.

07:47.352 --> 07:49.417
The top, the little garnish is perfect,

07:49.418 --> 07:50.649
because of the contrast.

07:50.650 --> 07:51.882
I especially love

07:51.883 --> 07:53.049
the use of the onions.

07:53.050 --> 07:54.484
The presentation's beautiful.

07:54.485 --> 07:58.350
Would you be so kind to have a taste?

07:58.351 --> 07:59.917
The dumpling...

07:59.918 --> 08:00.918
It's a little bit undercooked.

08:00.919 --> 08:02.917
It's like a hard matzah ball.

08:02.918 --> 08:07.050
The dumpling is a little...Tough.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.682
Judges, would you be so kind to score

08:08.683 --> 08:10.018
Tommy's dish on presentation?

08:10.019 --> 08:12.483
[Applause]   (Tommy)   all right.

08:12.484 --> 08:14.217
Total of 44 out of 50.

08:14.218 --> 08:16.283
That's what I'm talking about.
Thank you, guys.

08:16.284 --> 08:17.418
(Gordon)   great start.

08:17.419 --> 08:22.017
Now your Marks for taste,   please.

08:22.018 --> 08:24.083
Great news on   the presentation.

08:24.084 --> 08:25.783
Taste... slightly disappointing,

08:25.784 --> 08:27.317
however, a good start.

08:27.318 --> 08:28.583
Let's go.

08:28.584 --> 08:30.283
(Announcer) Up next is Paul

08:30.284 --> 08:33.017
with his fine-dining
take of tuna casserole.

08:33.018 --> 08:34.549
I like it.

08:34.551 --> 08:36.384
I think it's very simple,
almost like a crab cake.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.517
Thank you.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.582
Honestly, the little round brown thing

08:39.583 --> 08:41.717
makes it kind of look cat food-like.

08:41.717 --> 08:46.117
Wow.

08:46.118 --> 08:48.217
(Gordon)   please, judges.

08:48.218 --> 08:49.649
For me, it was a little heavy on tuna.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.016
I don't know whether   you used

08:51.017 --> 08:52.151
fresh tuna or canned tuna.

08:52.152 --> 08:55.250
I used canned tuna.

08:55.251 --> 08:56.617
I mean, canned tuna?

08:56.618 --> 08:59.950
You had a chance to really
do something wild.

08:59.951 --> 09:01.351
You gave us tuna casserole.

09:01.352 --> 09:02.950
I'll eat it.

09:02.951 --> 09:04.718
Judges, scores for presentation, please.

09:04.719 --> 09:07.717
Wow.

09:07.718 --> 09:09.783
33 out of 50.

09:09.784 --> 09:13.383
Taste.

09:13.384 --> 09:14.617
Oh, dear.

09:14.618 --> 09:16.183
27.

09:16.184 --> 09:17.717
At the individual challenges,

09:17.718 --> 09:20.050
that's when it's your time to shine,

09:20.051 --> 09:21.349
but I didn't put up today.

09:21.350 --> 09:22.784
I was very disappointed in myself.

09:22.785 --> 09:25.050
(Announcer) Fell short, casserole

09:25.051 --> 09:26.550
scoring only 60 points,

09:26.551 --> 09:29.083
leaving Tommy as the chef to beat.

09:29.084 --> 09:31.150
Next up...
Jennifer, let's go, please.

09:31.151 --> 09:33.717
(Announcer) With her version
of an Italian classic.

09:33.718 --> 09:35.518
I have lasagna,   which is ironic,

09:35.519 --> 09:37.383
'cause I absolutely hate lasagna.

09:37.384 --> 09:38.883
Who hates lasagna?

09:38.884 --> 09:41.117
Yikes.

09:41.118 --> 09:44.450
She was like, "I hate lasagna, and, um,

09:44.451 --> 09:45.849
you gon' hate this dish too."

09:45.850 --> 09:47.118
I was like, "dang."

09:47.119 --> 09:49.850
Not a good way to start off.

09:49.851 --> 09:51.550
For me, it's a little confusing,

09:51.551 --> 09:53.749
'cause I look at it and I'm not
really sure what I'm looking at.

09:53.750 --> 09:54.751
But I do love the color.

09:54.752 --> 09:55.751
Thank you.

09:55.752 --> 09:59.150
Please dig in.

09:59.151 --> 10:00.518
(Eric)   Well, lasagna it is.

10:00.519 --> 10:04.950
Delicious it's not.

10:04.951 --> 10:06.884
Um, this is a little disappointing.

10:06.885 --> 10:08.617
Damn it.

10:08.618 --> 10:12.817
Score for presentation, please.

10:12.818 --> 10:15.983
Presentation score is 28.

10:15.984 --> 10:17.082
(Jennifer)   wow.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.849
(Gordon)   taste scores, please.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.251
Wow.   (Gordon)   wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.817
24.

10:21.818 --> 10:23.883
That's a total of 52 out of 100.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.350
That's bad.

10:25.351 --> 10:26.883
They did not like my lasagna.

10:26.884 --> 10:29.950
I mean, seriously, these
judges, like, ripped me apart.

10:29.951 --> 10:32.550
(Gordon)   your dish. Ase present

10:32.551 --> 10:34.016
there wasn't any doubt in my mind

10:34.017 --> 10:35.951
that they were gonna love it
because I put a lot of thought

10:35.952 --> 10:37.550
and preparation into my dish.

10:37.551 --> 10:38.784
The dish that you're about   to enjoy

10:38.785 --> 10:42.317
is what I call a tower
of eggplant parmesan.

10:42.318 --> 10:44.117
Um, thoughts on presentation.

10:44.118 --> 10:46.150
It's impressive, 'cause
if a plate like that

10:46.151 --> 10:47.749
goes past you in a restaurant,
you kind of want

10:47.750 --> 10:49.482
to tackle the waiter and take a bite of it

10:49.483 --> 10:51.282
before it gets to the other person.

10:51.283 --> 10:52.316
I see the crispy fried-ness of it.

10:52.317 --> 10:53.851
I see the drip, the ooze of cheese.

10:53.852 --> 10:57.817
It's screaming out, "eat me."

10:57.818 --> 11:00.083
Mmm. It's delicious.

11:00.084 --> 11:02.583
(Susie) I'm amazed how it holds together.

11:02.584 --> 11:04.384
It is not overwhelmed by the cheese,

11:04.385 --> 11:06.717
so I think you did a great job. Thank you.

11:06.718 --> 11:09.517
Scores for presentation, please, judges.

11:09.518 --> 11:12.183
42 out of 50.   brilliant.

11:12.184 --> 11:14.750
Great start.   scores for taste, please.

11:14.751 --> 11:17.250
Wow.   44.

11:17.251 --> 11:18.250
Great job.

11:18.251 --> 11:20.383
Total of 86.

11:20.384 --> 11:21.584
That's the score to beat.

11:21.585 --> 11:23.450
You've raised the bar. Thank you.

11:23.451 --> 11:24.651
Will, let's go   with the meatloaf, please.

11:24.652 --> 11:26.150
Thank you.

11:26.151 --> 11:27.682
(Announcer) Elise is now in the lead

11:27.683 --> 11:29.616
and all that stands in her way of victory

11:29.617 --> 11:30.951
is Will and his meatloaf.

11:30.952 --> 11:32.650
Uh, for me,

11:32.651 --> 11:34.516
meatloaf is one of the most
comforting foods in the world.

11:34.517 --> 11:35.882
So I did bacon-wrapped   meatloaf.

11:35.883 --> 11:38.351
I poached it, caramelized
the bacon in butter.

11:38.352 --> 11:41.217
And the sauce is a fresh
morel and ketchup jus.

11:41.218 --> 11:42.418
The sauce, visually, for me,

11:42.419 --> 11:43.918
doesn't look that appetizing.

11:43.919 --> 11:45.417
Okay.

11:45.418 --> 11:47.850
Judges, please.

11:47.851 --> 11:49.051
The texture's nice. It's even.

11:49.052 --> 11:50.683
It's pleasing. It's delicious.

11:50.684 --> 11:51.916
Thank you very much.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.518
I'm not a big meatloaf fan and I really...

11:53.519 --> 11:55.850
I liked it.

11:55.851 --> 11:57.584
Scores on presentation, please, judges.

11:57.585 --> 12:00.450
Wow.

12:00.451 --> 12:02.550
38 out of 50, presentation.

12:02.551 --> 12:03.950
Oi.

12:03.951 --> 12:05.550
Will, in order to beat Elise,

12:05.551 --> 12:09.150
you need a nearly   perfect score.

12:09.151 --> 12:10.249
(Will) I know my food tastes good.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.349
I'm just hoping that the judges get

12:11.350 --> 12:12.618
what I'm trying to do it.

12:12.619 --> 12:14.618
Scores, please.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.578
(Announcer) It's the first

12:27.579 --> 12:29.213
individual challenge for the final five.

12:29.214 --> 12:32.379
The chefs have put their
spin on classic dishes

12:32.380 --> 12:33.879
and Elise holds the lead.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.245
86 to beat.

12:35.246 --> 12:37.512
(Announcer) Will just scored 38 out of 50

12:37.513 --> 12:40.045
for presentation on his meatloaf.

12:40.046 --> 12:43.045
And now it all comes down to
the judges' score for taste.

12:43.046 --> 12:45.145
(Gordon) Will, in order to beat Elise,

12:45.146 --> 12:47.846
you need a nearly perfect score.

12:49.546 --> 12:52.046
Scores, please.

12:57.180 --> 12:58.779
Wow.

12:58.780 --> 12:59.880
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

12:59.881 --> 13:02.145
49 out of 50.

13:02.146 --> 13:04.645
An almost perfect score. Thank you, chef.

13:04.646 --> 13:06.846
The winner of the challenge and
many congratulations, Will.

13:06.847 --> 13:08.912
Great job.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.912
Really good job.

13:10.913 --> 13:12.945
(Will) My taste scores were tens.

13:12.946 --> 13:15.912
I definitely think that this is
one of my proudest moments here.

13:15.913 --> 13:18.612
My mom's gonna be very happy with that.

13:18.613 --> 13:19.944
Elise, great job as well.

13:19.945 --> 13:21.411
That was a close second.

13:21.412 --> 13:22.746
Thank you, judges. Thank you very much.

13:22.747 --> 13:24.945
Thank you, guys.

13:24.946 --> 13:27.212
All right, Will, here's the good news.

13:27.213 --> 13:29.879
I've arranged for you to have
a phenomenal dining experience

13:29.880 --> 13:31.280
of some of the most unique
restaurants in L.A.

13:31.281 --> 13:33.312
Awesome.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.779
(Gordon) But it's no fun to dine
alone.

13:35.780 --> 13:38.180
I'd like you to choose one
of your fellow chefs

13:38.181 --> 13:42.312
to dine with you.

13:42.313 --> 13:43.645
Who you taking?

13:43.646 --> 13:46.579
I am gonna do the honorable
thing and I'm gonna

13:46.580 --> 13:47.944
take Elise 'cause she came in second.
Really?

13:47.945 --> 13:49.046
Yes. Thank you, Will.

13:49.047 --> 13:51.779
You did a good job, girl.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.213
Will made an honorable decision.

13:53.214 --> 13:55.412
But if I won, would I have took Elise?

13:55.413 --> 13:56.779
No!

13:56.780 --> 13:59.479
Outside, you have a chauffer-driven

13:59.480 --> 14:00.845
Rolls Royce Phantom.

14:00.846 --> 14:02.045
What? [Laughs]

14:02.046 --> 14:04.145
Ballers. Ballin'!

14:04.146 --> 14:05.145
[Laughter]

14:05.146 --> 14:07.545
That's awesome. What?

14:07.546 --> 14:09.745
Uh, Will and Elise, get ready.

14:09.746 --> 14:12.145
Your phantom is waiting.

14:12.146 --> 14:13.380
(Elise) Thank you, Will!

14:13.381 --> 14:16.045
Thank you!

14:16.046 --> 14:18.112
The rest of you,   it's laundry day.

14:18.113 --> 14:19.579
Oh, my God.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.212
You'll be spending
the afternoon

14:22.213 --> 14:24.412
washing in the old-fashioned way.

14:24.413 --> 14:27.212
Washboards, clotheslines,
and please be so kind

14:27.213 --> 14:29.379
to finish my jacket.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.145
Get out of here.
Yes, chef.

14:31.146 --> 14:34.112
[Sighs]

14:34.113 --> 14:35.612
Thanks for taking me, Will!

14:35.613 --> 14:38.945
Now you and I get to spend
a little one-on-one.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.511
I'm hoping that Elise coming
with me on this reward

14:40.512 --> 14:42.480
helps build team morale,
because in the past,

14:42.481 --> 14:44.478
a lot of people have had
problems with Elise,

14:44.479 --> 14:45.513
and I don't want those problems.

14:45.514 --> 14:47.545
Hell yeah.

14:47.546 --> 14:49.011
(Elise) Rhat's what I am talking about.

14:49.012 --> 14:50.013
(Will) That is exactly
what I'm talking about.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.645
The chariot awaits, madame.

14:51.646 --> 14:52.946
This is absolutely insane.

14:52.947 --> 14:55.813
(Elise)  Woo-hoo-hoo!
Stuntin'!

14:58.480 --> 14:59.979
(Will)   all right.

14:59.980 --> 15:00.980
(Both) That's Wolfgang Puck.

15:00.981 --> 15:02.545
Look at them.

15:02.546 --> 15:03.880
That's [Bleep], dude.

15:06.246 --> 15:07.379
Hello.

15:07.380 --> 15:08.711
You guys are traveling in style here.

15:08.712 --> 15:10.144
How are you, chef? How are you?

15:10.145 --> 15:12.244
(Will)   that is exactly
what I'm talking about.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.078
Can't wait to get inside
and actually eat his food.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.080
Enjoy. Thank you, chef.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.879
Very excited, chef.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.213
This is crazy. I know.

15:18.214 --> 15:20.612
Oh, my God. It looks so extravagant.

15:20.613 --> 15:22.244
(Will)   thank you very much, chef.

15:22.245 --> 15:23.913
(Lee)   this is basically
the celebration of beets.

15:23.914 --> 15:25.845
It's really the epitome of spring.

15:25.846 --> 15:27.011
It's beautiful.

15:27.012 --> 15:28.011
Enjoy it, all right?

15:28.012 --> 15:29.111
Thank you very much, chef.

15:29.112 --> 15:30.244
Thank you. Appreciate it.

15:30.245 --> 15:31.513
Whoa. Shall we?

15:31.514 --> 15:32.812
Let's go.

15:32.813 --> 15:34.712
Mmm.
That is so good.

15:34.713 --> 15:36.245
As an up and coming chef, to me,

15:36.246 --> 15:38.544
this is the absolute perfect
way to spend the day.

15:38.545 --> 15:40.346
This is one of the best   rewards yet.

15:40.347 --> 15:43.712
(Announcer) While Elise and Will
enjoy some of L.A.'s finest cuisine,

15:43.713 --> 15:46.545
back in Hell's Kitchen...

15:46.546 --> 15:47.644
I can't believe I'm doing this.

15:47.645 --> 15:49.113
(Announcer) Tommy, Jennifer, and Paul

15:49.114 --> 15:51.079
are suffering through laundry day.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.845
(Jennifer)   I'm hoping that one
of you   has done this before.

15:53.846 --> 15:55.046
(Will)   thank you very much, chef.

15:55.047 --> 15:56.145
Seriously.

15:56.146 --> 15:58.179
We use washing machines, lady.

15:58.180 --> 16:00.745
I have never hand-washed
laundry in my life.

16:00.746 --> 16:02.113
This is, like, super nasty.

16:02.114 --> 16:03.912
[Raspberries]

16:03.913 --> 16:07.279
Boil, bubble, toil, and trouble,

16:07.280 --> 16:09.445
what do you put   in a witch's brew?

16:09.446 --> 16:10.446
I've never worked with Tommy,

16:10.447 --> 16:13.712
so this is my first experience,

16:13.713 --> 16:15.745
and, uh, Tommy's very different.

16:15.746 --> 16:18.945
God help me right now.

16:18.946 --> 16:21.979
(Announcer) While Tommy marches
to the beat of his own drummer...

16:21.980 --> 16:23.711
(Eric)   welcome to foundry on Melrose.

16:23.712 --> 16:25.778
(Announcer) Will and Elise have
moved on to their second restaurant

16:25.779 --> 16:27.713
and a special meal prepared for them

16:27.714 --> 16:29.013
by chef Eric Greenspan.

16:29.014 --> 16:30.779
Look at that. It's so pretty.

16:30.780 --> 16:32.112
This is our duck breast.

16:32.113 --> 16:33.311
(Elise)   ooh.

16:33.312 --> 16:34.513
(Eric)   New York strip loin.

16:34.514 --> 16:36.279
Can we eat it? Yay! Grub.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.544
I got to tell you.

16:37.545 --> 16:39.044
Really, really impressive stuff today.

16:39.045 --> 16:40.346
Thank you, chef.
It is a pleasure   having you guys.

16:40.347 --> 16:41.845
Thank you very much.

16:41.846 --> 16:44.379
It's a pleasure being here.
It's a pleasure to be here.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.812
That's bomb.

16:45.813 --> 16:46.945
Mmm.

16:46.946 --> 16:48.813
You and I have never cooked together.

16:48.814 --> 16:50.612
You know what I'm saying?

16:50.613 --> 16:52.478
And, uh, all the [Bleep] with the Red Team,

16:52.479 --> 16:53.980
we just got to   make sure that

16:53.981 --> 16:55.579
we do what we got to do as a team.

16:55.580 --> 16:56.978
Kick ass and take some names

16:56.979 --> 16:58.111
on your way out the door.

16:58.112 --> 16:59.346
Maybe some of your "prequestions"

16:59.347 --> 17:01.479
or thinking to yourself,
"oh, she's about drama,"

17:01.480 --> 17:02.845
Will be erased.

17:02.846 --> 17:06.012
I know I was the most hated
member of the Red Team,

17:06.012 --> 17:07.877
but I don't have to explain
myself to anybody,

17:07.878 --> 17:09.846
especially in a competition setting.

17:15.180 --> 17:17.545
[Phone rings]

17:17.546 --> 17:18.811
Hello?

17:18.813 --> 17:21.412
I'd like to see everybody
in the dining room

17:21.413 --> 17:23.479
with their jackets on urgently.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.645
Yes, chef.

17:25.646 --> 17:30.145
Downstairs to the dining room   urgently.

17:30.146 --> 17:31.946
Oh, my God.   what the hell is going on?

17:33.846 --> 17:35.879
(Gordon)   listen carefully.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.845
Tomorrow night,

17:37.846 --> 17:42.045
you will be in one kitchen together.

17:42.046 --> 17:46.046
But there will be another
team inside the red kitchen.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.579
They too

17:50.580 --> 17:53.879
have had the honor of
wearing a black jacket.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.179
Awesome.

17:55.180 --> 17:56.479
Oh, my God.

17:56.480 --> 18:01.312
And I want you to meet
your opponents right now.

18:01.313 --> 18:03.979
From hell's kitchen  five...

18:03.980 --> 18:05.512
You want to hear something, dude?

18:05.513 --> 18:07.045
I Will cook circles around you.

18:07.046 --> 18:08.313
You couldn't cook my [Bleep].

18:08.314 --> 18:10.579
(Gordon) Say hello to Ben.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.545
[Applause]

18:12.546 --> 18:14.778
I used to have a crush on
Ben, so I recognize Ben.

18:14.779 --> 18:16.380
Look at me. I'm, like, all blushing.

18:16.381 --> 18:18.345
Our next chef,

18:18.346 --> 18:20.279
from  Hell's Kitchen six...

18:20.280 --> 18:21.580
I'm earning my way back
into the kitchen, chef.

18:21.581 --> 18:22.845
You...

18:22.846 --> 18:23.845
Let's go.

18:23.846 --> 18:24.880
I am a fighter.

18:24.881 --> 18:26.712
Get off my station, please!

18:26.713 --> 18:28.979
(Gordon) Tennille.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.645
What? What?

18:30.646 --> 18:31.979
I remember Tennille.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.580
She's a strong woman. She's tough as nails.

18:33.581 --> 18:36.012
I want to be just like her.

18:36.013 --> 18:38.512
And now, from  Hell's Kitchen eight...

18:38.513 --> 18:39.879
How's my sides?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.011
You need... I got...

18:41.012 --> 18:42.380
I just need you to say, "I'm ready."

18:42.381 --> 18:44.779
Well done, trev. Let's go!

18:44.780 --> 18:45.913
(Gordon)   trev.

18:45.914 --> 18:47.779
(Elise)   what?

18:47.780 --> 18:50.812
Holy [Bleep].

18:50.813 --> 18:52.845
Now, from  Hell's Kitchen eight...

18:52.846 --> 18:54.745
What happened to your eyebrows?

18:54.746 --> 18:55.913
Did you singe 'em off? No.

18:55.914 --> 18:58.312
I got 'em tattooed on.

18:58.313 --> 18:59.780
(Gordon)   scallops cooked perfectly.

18:59.781 --> 19:01.612
Come back to me! I Will, chef!

19:01.613 --> 19:02.813
(Gordon)   Jillian.

19:02.814 --> 19:05.545
(Elise)   Jillian. Okay.

19:05.546 --> 19:06.612
[Applause]

19:06.613 --> 19:08.045
And last...

19:08.046 --> 19:09.280
Brace yourselves.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.579
This is crazy.

19:10.580 --> 19:13.445
From  Hell's Kitchen six...

19:13.446 --> 19:14.644
Don't touch me, bro.

19:14.645 --> 19:15.713
Bitch, move over.

19:15.714 --> 19:17.279
Let me put this [Bleep] food out.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.879
Now! Let's go!

19:18.880 --> 19:20.444
You're gonna love it, brother.
You're gonna love it.

19:20.445 --> 19:21.778
My name's van, by the way.

19:21.779 --> 19:23.046
(Gordon)   van.

19:23.047 --> 19:25.412
Yeah, baby! Game time!

19:25.413 --> 19:27.112
Game time!

19:27.113 --> 19:29.812
Whoo!

19:29.813 --> 19:30.880
It's great to see you all,   yes.

19:30.881 --> 19:32.812
Welcome back. I really mean that.

19:32.813 --> 19:35.445
Chefs, trust me.

19:35.446 --> 19:38.912
They are here...

19:38.913 --> 19:40.945
To kick your ass.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.812
Let's get it on. Whoo!

19:42.813 --> 19:44.145
You're not. Bring it.

19:44.146 --> 19:45.644
Did you guys bring your sunglasses?

19:45.645 --> 19:46.646
'Cause we're about to shine.

19:46.647 --> 19:50.212
Nah, I just brought body bags.

19:50.213 --> 19:51.480
See what happens tomorrow night.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.045
Game on.

19:53.046 --> 19:54.511
I think the returning chefs are
gonna bring their "a" game.

19:54.512 --> 19:56.011
They all have a chip on their shoulder

19:56.012 --> 19:57.580
that they came here and they
didn't make it to the end.

19:57.581 --> 20:00.078
They're our stiffest competition
so far in Hell's Kitchen

20:00.079 --> 20:01.346
and I'm not taking it lightly.

20:01.347 --> 20:02.612
Okay.

20:02.613 --> 20:04.479
Each team Will be cooking

20:04.480 --> 20:06.879
a menu that you design.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.279
What?   that's right.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.345
Awesome.

20:09.346 --> 20:11.745
You Will have one hour   to decide

20:11.746 --> 20:13.812
what your menus Will be, yes.

20:13.813 --> 20:14.845
All right.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.512
Your hour starts from now.

20:16.513 --> 20:17.613
Get going. Let's do it.

20:17.614 --> 20:19.112
Let's light this candle.

20:19.113 --> 20:21.912
(Will) Much respect to the returning vets.

20:21.913 --> 20:25.245
They're badass people. Whoo!

20:25.246 --> 20:27.345
But we are going to kick
their [Bleep] asses.

20:27.346 --> 20:28.645
Let's go, baby.

20:28.646 --> 20:31.245
This ain't mama first time at the rodeo.

20:31.246 --> 20:33.078
I think the current chefs should
be shaking in their boots,

20:33.079 --> 20:34.411
'cause not only have we been here,

20:34.412 --> 20:36.480
but this is a chance for
us to come in and compete

20:36.481 --> 20:37.879
for our reputations.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.046
For us, it's a pride thing.

20:39.047 --> 20:40.579
Second chance, baby. Come on.

20:40.580 --> 20:41.879
We all know the routine.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.279
Apps first. Apps first, knock 'em out.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.144
A leafy salad, a nice tomato salad.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.144
We could just do... straight up...

20:47.145 --> 20:48.278
(Both) Fried green tomatoes.

20:48.279 --> 20:49.480
Fried green tomato? That sounds awesome.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.079
Sounds delicious.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.246
We're on top of our games tonight

20:52.247 --> 20:53.779
planning this menu.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.079
We all got along.
It's 'cause we're vets, baby.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.344
We been through this before.

20:57.345 --> 20:58.480
Cool beans, guys.

20:58.481 --> 21:00.579
I'm liking this.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.812
What about lemon parmesan Risotto?

21:02.813 --> 21:03.980
With what garnish for it?

21:03.981 --> 21:05.679
Wild mushroom.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.045
Do a lemon thyme Risotto
with the mushroom, yeah.

21:08.046 --> 21:09.411
I'm putting on the lemon parmesan Risotto.

21:09.412 --> 21:10.911
Elise, write "lemon thyme Risotto,"

21:10.912 --> 21:12.480
'cause it's obviously gonna
have parmesan cheese.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.145
I heard you. Okay.

21:14.146 --> 21:15.144
All right, take it easy.

21:15.145 --> 21:16.413
It's not all what you want!

21:20.313 --> 21:21.346
What about my idea   with tuna tartare?

21:21.347 --> 21:23.445
I'll do tuna tartare.

21:23.446 --> 21:25.113
(Will) Much respect to the returning vets.

21:25.114 --> 21:26.745
All right, tuna tartare with, um...

21:26.746 --> 21:27.746
(Tommy)   do, like, a wasabi avocado...

21:27.747 --> 21:29.145
Yeah.

21:29.146 --> 21:30.711
Look, if I feel like everybody's ideas

21:30.712 --> 21:32.211
ain't being considered,
then we gonna start

21:32.212 --> 21:33.511
nixing ideas, 'cause no person
here is gonna dominate,

21:33.512 --> 21:34.644
'cause it's a team effort.

21:34.645 --> 21:35.646
We are. We're making tuna tartare.

21:35.647 --> 21:36.845
You are.

21:36.846 --> 21:38.445
Everything that you guys say,

21:38.446 --> 21:39.746
I notice you try to stick with.

21:39.747 --> 21:41.345
You wanted tuna tartare.

21:41.346 --> 21:42.344
Anything that we're saying, you don't want.

21:42.345 --> 21:43.411
You don't want tuna tartare?

21:43.412 --> 21:44.844
You can't say that at all, girl.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.780
You got your Risotto up...
No, that's his Risotto.

21:46.781 --> 21:49.745
I said "lemon parm." I didn't say "thyme."

21:49.746 --> 21:51.446
What do you guys   think of that, uh,

21:51.447 --> 21:52.446
wasabi crust...

21:52.447 --> 21:54.979
Nope. I don't like it.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.212
I think the tuna tartare
idea was a good idea.

21:57.213 --> 21:58.912
I do too. You brought it up.

21:58.913 --> 22:00.611
I said "tuna tartare," and
he completely dominated

22:00.612 --> 22:02.078
everything that was said.

22:02.079 --> 22:03.380
I didn't even get to finish my thought.

22:03.381 --> 22:04.845
So finish your thought.

22:04.846 --> 22:06.578
What's the point? What's the point?

22:06.579 --> 22:08.746
Because we're here to listen.
No, you're not listening...

22:08.747 --> 22:10.579
[Overlapping arguing]

22:10.580 --> 22:11.913
(Jennifer)   you know what?
We need to chill right now.

22:11.914 --> 22:14.279
Seriously, we all just need to chill.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.079
[Overlapping arguing]

22:17.080 --> 22:18.412
Shut up!

22:18.413 --> 22:19.445
Elise...

22:19.446 --> 22:20.646
You need to sit down for a minute!

22:20.647 --> 22:22.712
We need to get this going!

22:22.713 --> 22:24.679
[Overlapplng arguing]

22:24.680 --> 22:25.911
I'm not [Bleep] cooking Will's menu.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.444
I'm not [Bleep] cooking Paul's menu.

22:27.445 --> 22:28.780
This is not Red Team...

22:28.781 --> 22:29.780
[Screams]

22:29.781 --> 22:31.245
I'm sick of this!

22:31.246 --> 22:33.244
Me too.   this is exactly
what   I was talking about

22:33.245 --> 22:35.713
when I said that we didn't
want the Red Team's [Bleep]

22:35.714 --> 22:37.146
Coming over here!

22:40.646 --> 22:42.312
You had to have been the problem.

22:42.313 --> 22:43.679
Whatever.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.613
I'm not the problem, 'cause I'm still here.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.613
Elise...   no!

22:46.614 --> 22:48.545
You're trying to overstep and...

22:48.546 --> 22:49.644
I'm not overstepping.

22:49.645 --> 22:50.711
You [Bleep] came out here with a list

22:50.712 --> 22:52.078
you been writing for a week.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.511
Just write "Elise's menu" on top.

22:53.512 --> 22:54.878
You do what you want to do.

22:54.879 --> 22:56.078
Why don't we write "Blue Team menu"?

22:56.079 --> 22:57.311
If you want to make the
whole menu, go ahead,

22:57.312 --> 22:58.578
but I'm gonna vote you out if we lose.

22:58.579 --> 22:59.778
(Will)   I'm done.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.346
I'm done. I'm not dealing with this.

23:01.347 --> 23:02.812
I'm done.

23:02.813 --> 23:04.645
I'm gonna go home right now. So?

23:04.646 --> 23:06.779
(Will)   yeah.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.779
Please come back.
Come back for what reason?

23:08.780 --> 23:10.113
Please stop the dramatics, Jennifer.

23:10.114 --> 23:11.579
Oh, my God. Elise, God.

23:11.580 --> 23:12.711
"Oh, please. Oh, please."

23:12.712 --> 23:13.778
This is so [Bleep].

23:13.779 --> 23:15.246
(Jennifer)   no, please, Will.

23:15.247 --> 23:17.279
Oh, my God.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.312
Bye-bye!

23:18.313 --> 23:20.745
Fine. Less competition.

23:24.339 --> 23:26.904
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay is putting
the final five to the test

23:26.905 --> 23:30.571
by having them cook against five
chefs from previous seasons.

23:30.572 --> 23:31.837
I'm not [Bleep] cooking Will's menu!

23:31.838 --> 23:33.203
I'm not [Bleep] cooking Paul's!

23:33.204 --> 23:34.772
Sit down.   this is not
Red Team,   Blue Team...

23:34.773 --> 23:35.772
[Screams]

23:35.773 --> 23:37.104
I'm sick of this!

23:37.105 --> 23:38.738
(Announcer) But Elise's antics

23:38.739 --> 23:40.604
have put Will over the edge.

23:40.605 --> 23:42.270
You had to have been the problem. Whatever.

23:42.271 --> 23:43.970
You had to have been the
problem on the Red Team.

23:43.971 --> 23:45.503
I'm not the problem, 'cause I'm still here.

23:45.504 --> 23:46.505
(Will)   I'm gonna go home right now.

23:46.506 --> 23:47.671
So?

23:47.672 --> 23:48.838
Will.

23:48.839 --> 23:50.037
This is some [Bleep].

23:50.038 --> 23:51.405
(Jennifer) No, please, Will.

23:51.406 --> 23:53.438
Oh, my God.

23:53.439 --> 23:55.971
Bye-bye!

23:55.972 --> 23:58.371
If he wants to act like
that about it, then fine.

23:58.372 --> 23:59.603
Less competition.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.772
I don't tolerate disrespect.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.504
Drop the [Bleep]!
We got to get this done!

24:03.505 --> 24:07.038
(Will) There's just something
about Elise that lights my fuse.

24:07.039 --> 24:08.871
But I came here to win.

24:08.872 --> 24:10.437
I got to stay focused on the prize.

24:10.438 --> 24:12.370
And if it entails me
having to remove myself

24:12.371 --> 24:14.005
from the situation,
that's what I need to do.

24:14.006 --> 24:16.071
Tuna tartare
with shaved pickled cucumbers.

24:16.072 --> 24:18.538
Are we gonna ever finish this?

24:18.539 --> 24:19.670
(Trev)   I'm loving this, man.

24:19.671 --> 24:21.139
This is a total setup for success menu.

24:21.140 --> 24:22.838
All right, so everybody's good?

24:22.839 --> 24:24.003
Yeah, definitely.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.405
Okay, we'll see you guys tomorrow.

24:25.406 --> 24:27.204
(Announcer) Winds down, hour clock

24:27.205 --> 24:30.238
the returning chefs are feeling
confident in their menu,

24:30.239 --> 24:34.239
while the current chefs are
forced to settle on theirs.

24:35.639 --> 24:37.838
I like the menu.
Do you like the menu? It's fine.

24:37.839 --> 24:39.470
Do you like it or is it fine?
No, it's good. It's a good menu.

24:39.471 --> 24:40.639
Yeah. You like it? All right.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.605
I'm gonna throw up.

24:45.372 --> 24:47.203
(Announcer) After a combative evening,

24:47.204 --> 24:49.172
the chefs prepare for their
first dinner service

24:49.173 --> 24:50.804
together as the black team.

24:50.805 --> 24:53.438
How's everyone looking?
Everybody feel confident?

24:53.439 --> 24:54.571
(All) Yeah.

24:54.572 --> 24:55.839
(Announcer) But the veteran chefs competing

24:55.840 --> 24:57.204
in the red kitchen...

24:57.205 --> 24:58.805
Everybody just start
setting up the stations.

24:58.806 --> 25:00.704
(Announcer) Are all business.

25:00.705 --> 25:02.172
I've got garnish almost set up.

25:02.173 --> 25:03.404
Let's go.

25:03.405 --> 25:04.405
I think that the energy on the returning

25:04.406 --> 25:05.903
alumni black team is strong.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.772
All of us feel like there's
unfinished business,

25:07.773 --> 25:10.571
and the advantage that we have
is that we're not concerned

25:10.572 --> 25:11.639
about who's gonna be eliminated.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.571
We're here to just do the food.

25:14.572 --> 25:16.338
Jennifer, that's how you want 'em?

25:16.339 --> 25:18.004
They look good.   okay.

25:18.005 --> 25:20.604
I'm not gonna say the black
team are bffs with Elise,

25:20.605 --> 25:23.204
but when service comes, we
have to work as a team.

25:23.205 --> 25:24.270
I didn't have time to put whipped cream

25:24.271 --> 25:25.339
in a pastry bag yet.

25:25.340 --> 25:27.071
I'll help you work on all that.

25:27.072 --> 25:28.904
We can't have a blow up tonight.

25:28.905 --> 25:30.603
For Elise's sake, she better make sure

25:30.604 --> 25:32.003
that this service goes flawlessly.

25:32.004 --> 25:33.805
'Cause if it doesn't, it's [Bleep] over.

25:33.806 --> 25:34.904
Okay, James.

25:34.905 --> 25:36.471
Yes, chef? Open Hell's Kitchen.

25:36.472 --> 25:37.472
Let's go. Yeah.

25:48.039 --> 25:49.039
(Announcer) For tonight's dinner service,

25:49.040 --> 25:50.938
each team has created menus

25:50.939 --> 25:52.604
consisting of four appetizers,

25:52.605 --> 25:55.204
four entrees, and three desserts.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.871
On order, 4 couples, table 20,

25:56.872 --> 25:58.303
two scallop, two Risotto, two beet salads.

25:58.304 --> 25:59.303
(All) Yes, chef.

25:59.304 --> 26:00.337
Excellent. Let's go.

26:00.338 --> 26:01.805
3 1/2, Paul. 3 1/2 on the first 2,

26:01.806 --> 26:05.104
5 on the second 2.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.738
Returning chefs, here we go.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.203
On order, 4 couples,   table 30,

26:08.204 --> 26:09.603
2 gnocchi, 1 prawn, 1 tomato salad.

26:09.604 --> 26:10.937
Entree, two tuna, two beef.

26:10.938 --> 26:12.105
(All) Yes, chef.

26:12.106 --> 26:13.104
Whoo!

26:13.105 --> 26:14.170
This the moment.

26:14.171 --> 26:15.337
Time to leave it all in the kitchen.

26:15.338 --> 26:16.837
Let it all happen. Let it all hang out.

26:16.838 --> 26:18.372
Tonight is the night
where it all goes down.

26:18.373 --> 26:19.471
Oh, [Bleep].

26:19.472 --> 26:21.338
It's game time, baby. Game time!

26:21.339 --> 26:23.805
(Announcer) While van pumps
himself up in the red kitchen...

26:23.806 --> 26:25.704
Hello! Five minutes to the window!

26:25.705 --> 26:27.337
(Announcer) Back in the blue kitchen...

26:27.338 --> 26:28.339
How long on those beet salads?

26:28.340 --> 26:30.138
That's on Tommy.

26:30.139 --> 26:31.505
(Will) There's just something
about Elise that lights my fuse.

26:31.506 --> 26:34.171
To get their team off to a
strong start on appetizers.

26:34.172 --> 26:35.570
Yo, you got to keep it clean, bro.

26:35.571 --> 26:36.637
You got to make sure   they're clean.

26:36.638 --> 26:37.903
I'm gonna say what I have to say

26:37.904 --> 26:39.737
to try to get a fire under Tommy's ass.

26:39.738 --> 26:42.137
Get the [Bleep] beets off the
[Bleep]damn rim of the plate.

26:42.138 --> 26:43.203
Will, how long on that?

26:43.204 --> 26:44.437
3 1/2 minutes, he's out on that.

26:44.438 --> 26:45.472
How's that look?

26:45.473 --> 26:47.671
I would go a little less dressing on it.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.503
Tommy was just, like, Will's bitch boy.

26:49.504 --> 26:50.937
Good. Yeah, it's good, right?

26:50.938 --> 26:52.303
Will was so busy holding his hands,

26:52.304 --> 26:53.539
both of 'em, and his [Bleep].

26:53.540 --> 26:57.539
Dude, the [Bleep] wonton chips, Tom.

26:58.105 --> 26:59.339
(Tommy)   sorry, man.

26:59.340 --> 27:00.904
Let's go. Come on, guys.

27:00.905 --> 27:02.271
Roll the orders, yes.

27:02.272 --> 27:03.771
Trev, take control. Come on.

27:03.772 --> 27:05.237
All right, let's go! How long?

27:05.238 --> 27:06.303
Yes, chef? Open Hell's Kitchen.

27:06.304 --> 27:07.503
I'm more confident in the kitchen.

27:07.504 --> 27:09.037
You're gonna have three
gnocchis all day coming.

27:09.038 --> 27:10.770
You're gonna have two prawns coming.
I got it.

27:10.771 --> 27:11.937
I used to operate mile a minute.

27:11.938 --> 27:13.839
Now I'm more cool, calm, collected.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.438
Pull out those. What did we decide?

27:16.439 --> 27:17.603
Ready, ready, ready.

27:17.604 --> 27:18.737
If you're rushing around like an idiot,

27:18.738 --> 27:19.803
you're gonna look like an idiot.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.137
I need three tomato salads...

27:21.138 --> 27:22.839
They're right there. They're right there.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.038
I have that leadership about me now where,

27:25.039 --> 27:26.503
you know, people listen when I talk.

27:26.504 --> 27:27.705
Prawn, prawn, prawn, plate.

27:27.706 --> 27:30.438
Ben, Ben, Ben, need you. Prawn, plate.

27:30.439 --> 27:32.137
I've learned now to slow
down in the kitchen,

27:32.138 --> 27:33.405
take your time, do it right.

27:33.406 --> 27:35.338
Frisee salad to the window.

27:35.339 --> 27:36.772
We don't need to make it that fast out

27:36.773 --> 27:38.438
or it's gonna sit.

27:38.439 --> 27:40.170
All right, I just want to
have... I want to be ahead.

27:40.171 --> 27:41.239
Just keep calm.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.971
Yeah, buddy, yeah!

27:42.972 --> 27:45.439
What salad is that for?
That's for the next one there.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.571
Trev! Yeah.

27:46.572 --> 27:48.704
You give me the frisee
salad for the next table.

27:48.705 --> 27:49.737
We're jumping ahead   of ourselves.

27:49.738 --> 27:50.739
Come on, big boy. One minute.

27:50.740 --> 27:52.038
Take it back.

27:52.039 --> 27:54.004
Trev, we don't even need this.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.904
Now you gotta make it again.

27:55.905 --> 27:58.037
(Announcer) It's 45 minutes into
dinner service and thanks to Will...

27:58.038 --> 27:59.772
Walking to the window, chef.
Walking to the window.

27:59.773 --> 28:01.938
(Announcer) The black team of current chefs

28:01.939 --> 28:04.138
is off to a great start with appetizers...

28:04.139 --> 28:05.337
That's fantastic.

28:05.338 --> 28:07.303
(Announcer) And is now
moving on to entrees.

28:07.304 --> 28:08.403
I'm walking if you're walking 'em up.

28:08.404 --> 28:09.405
(Elise)   oh, you're walking?

28:09.406 --> 28:11.438
I'm walking if you're walking.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.272
Uh, what do you think?
This one's perfect, right, Paul?

28:13.273 --> 28:14.272
Paul? Paul?

28:14.273 --> 28:16.238
This one's perfect, right?

28:16.239 --> 28:17.571
Yeah. Huh? Yes or no?

28:17.572 --> 28:18.705
(Paul)   yes, yes.   yes, Elise.

28:18.706 --> 28:20.771
Elise was constantly questioning herself,

28:20.772 --> 28:22.305
which is not... a great chef doesn't do.

28:22.306 --> 28:24.004
That looks good to you?

28:24.005 --> 28:25.704
Yes. Thank you.

28:25.705 --> 28:28.538
That just proves to me you
don't know what you're doing.

28:28.539 --> 28:31.104
Paul...   yes?

28:31.105 --> 28:32.439
(Elise)   you think that's medium
or you think that's okay?

28:32.440 --> 28:34.004
I think that's fine. All right.

28:34.005 --> 28:35.003
(Gordon)   where's the filet?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.105
Give me that filet, Elise!

28:36.106 --> 28:38.371
Right behind you.

28:38.372 --> 28:39.738
Looks nice, the dish.

28:39.739 --> 28:42.138
That beef's cooked perfectly.
Thank you, chef.

28:42.139 --> 28:44.604
(Announcer) Elise has
delivered perfect meat

28:44.605 --> 28:46.971
with a little guidance from Paul.

28:46.972 --> 28:48.372
Meanwhile, in the other kitchen,

28:48.373 --> 28:50.671
Tennille is ready with her entrees.

28:50.672 --> 28:51.772
(Tennille)   two tuna coming up, chef.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.538
Two tuna.

28:53.539 --> 28:54.839
Guys, come here, quick! All of you!

28:54.840 --> 28:56.338
30 seconds! Quick!

28:56.339 --> 28:58.271
Touch that! It's ice cold!

28:58.272 --> 29:01.938
Hell's Kitchen is definitely
what I remembered it to be...

29:01.939 --> 29:03.738
Tennille! Yes, sir.

29:03.739 --> 29:04.771
And worse.

29:04.772 --> 29:05.872
How long, Tennille?

29:05.873 --> 29:07.771
I have two tuna, right?

29:07.772 --> 29:10.404
Chef talks like a car auctioneer.

29:10.405 --> 29:12.205
Tennille, are we ready, are
we going, are we moving?

29:12.206 --> 29:13.304
Let's go!

29:13.305 --> 29:14.672
My head is about to explode.

29:14.673 --> 29:17.738
Somebody give me butter.
Anybody got butter over there?

29:17.739 --> 29:18.805
Can you grab me saute pans?

29:18.806 --> 29:21.538
Tennille on the fish station...

29:21.539 --> 29:23.338
[Raspberries] Bad.

29:23.339 --> 29:24.871
What is this?

29:24.872 --> 29:26.304
Tennille! Chef?

29:26.305 --> 29:27.904
The tuna's overcooked.

29:27.905 --> 29:29.571
It's like canned tuna. Come on!

29:29.572 --> 29:30.970
Whoo.   (Tennille)   yes, chef.

29:30.971 --> 29:32.739
(Announcer) While Tennille
makes yet another attempt

29:32.740 --> 29:35.138
at the tuna, over in the blue kitchen,

29:35.139 --> 29:36.904
chef Ramsay is waiting on the...

29:36.905 --> 29:38.438
Lobster. How long, Paul?

29:38.439 --> 29:39.503
I'm walking it up right now, chef.

29:39.504 --> 29:40.872
Come on, Paul.   drive it.

29:40.873 --> 29:43.038
Let's go!

29:43.039 --> 29:44.105
Lobster's overcooked.

29:44.106 --> 29:45.638
Really overcooked.

29:45.639 --> 29:47.138
Paul, come here. Yes, chef?

29:47.139 --> 29:48.272
Your butter's too hot.

29:48.273 --> 29:49.838
It's like rubber there, yes.

29:49.839 --> 29:51.039
Come on. Sorry, chef.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.871
Drop me two more in there quickly.

29:52.872 --> 29:55.471
Paul talks a good game, but
when it comes to service,

29:55.472 --> 29:57.004
he just can't handle the pressure.

29:57.005 --> 29:58.239
How long do you need, Paul?

29:58.240 --> 29:59.571
Uh, four min... five.

29:59.572 --> 30:01.171
Paul was hesitating.

30:01.172 --> 30:02.905
I've been a leader since the
first day I stepped in here.

30:02.906 --> 30:05.038
Now it's my time. I'm taking over.

30:05.039 --> 30:06.439
Three minutes to the window, Paul?

30:06.440 --> 30:08.439
No, no, no. Two minutes for you, Jennifer?

30:08.440 --> 30:09.937
All right. Come on, let's go.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.237
Elise, slow down. Slow it down.

30:11.238 --> 30:13.037
I need to get this lobster out first.

30:13.038 --> 30:14.903
You're not gonna be bossing me around.

30:14.904 --> 30:16.105
So you need more than three minutes?

30:16.106 --> 30:17.638
Just hold it.

30:17.639 --> 30:18.870
Elise tries to bully everybody,

30:18.871 --> 30:20.270
but she ain't getting
the [Bleep] best of me.

30:20.271 --> 30:21.439
Lobster, Paul, how long, please?

30:21.440 --> 30:22.804
Three min...

30:22.805 --> 30:24.304
Two minutes to the window!

30:24.305 --> 30:26.204
Oh, please.

30:26.205 --> 30:27.370
Paul, it's your call!

30:27.371 --> 30:28.439
Two...   (Elise)   I'm ready.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.338
I'm ready.

30:30.339 --> 30:33.405
Holding on Paul.

30:39.954 --> 30:41.919
(Announcer) It's a hour and a half
into service,

30:41.920 --> 30:44.352
and while the returning chefs
are pushing out entrees...

30:44.353 --> 30:45.821
(Van)   yeah, buddy!   yeah!

30:45.822 --> 30:47.220
Ha-ha!

30:47.221 --> 30:48.719
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay
is pushing Paul for...

30:48.720 --> 30:49.921
(Gordon)   lobster.   how long, please?

30:49.922 --> 30:50.921
Three min...

30:50.922 --> 30:52.421
Two minutes to the window!

30:52.422 --> 30:54.353
Oh, please.

30:54.354 --> 30:55.552
Paul, it's your call!

30:55.553 --> 30:56.554
Two...   (Elise)   I'm ready.

30:56.555 --> 31:00.120
I'm ready. Holding on Paul.

31:00.121 --> 31:01.886
You're in control! Yes, chef!

31:01.887 --> 31:03.452
I'm looking for a leader, not a line cook.

31:03.453 --> 31:04.721
Come on! Yes, let's go!

31:04.722 --> 31:06.653
Three minutes!

31:06.654 --> 31:08.519
(Announcer) As Paul tries to control
Elise on the meat station...

31:08.520 --> 31:09.619
I need garnish for two fish,

31:09.620 --> 31:11.085
garnish for two lobster in three!

31:11.086 --> 31:12.285
Three minutes heard!

31:12.286 --> 31:13.452
(Announcer) Over in the red kitchen...

31:13.453 --> 31:14.921
Mahi-mahi, tuna, lamb, beef.

31:14.922 --> 31:16.686
Runnin' it! Coming at you!

31:16.687 --> 31:18.819
It took me a few minutes,
but once I got my bearings

31:18.820 --> 31:20.687
in the kitchen, it was just
like riding a bicycle.

31:20.688 --> 31:22.453
Coming behind. Very hot.

31:22.454 --> 31:24.553
Fired back up, baby! Whoo!

31:24.554 --> 31:26.586
All right, how we doing? How we doing?

31:26.587 --> 31:27.821
Lamb's requested...

31:27.822 --> 31:29.453
Oh, [Bleep], here we go.

31:29.454 --> 31:30.821
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

31:30.822 --> 31:32.920
Come on! All of you, come here!

31:32.921 --> 31:34.019
Lamb requested medium well.

31:34.020 --> 31:35.019
Is that medium well?

31:35.020 --> 31:36.185
(All) No, chef.

31:36.186 --> 31:37.319
Come on! Come on, van!

31:37.320 --> 31:38.452
Pull it back, baby!

31:38.453 --> 31:39.552
I undercooked a lamb dish,

31:39.553 --> 31:41.054
and chef Ramsay threw 'em back at me.

31:41.055 --> 31:42.420
What's new?

31:42.421 --> 31:44.120
Van, slow down!

31:44.121 --> 31:45.720
[Bleep]. I know you can cook

31:45.721 --> 31:47.187
perfectly well, and your temperatures.

31:47.188 --> 31:48.786
Yes, chef. Let's go.

31:48.787 --> 31:50.254
Five minutes to the window.

31:50.255 --> 31:52.053
Two lamb, two beef!

31:52.054 --> 31:54.053
[Clapping] Let's go, van!

31:54.054 --> 31:56.053
This is why we're here, baby.

31:56.054 --> 31:58.353
(Announcer) Into dinner service,

31:58.354 --> 32:00.353
and with van bouncing back...

32:00.354 --> 32:01.985
Hey, van, they're cooked
beautifully... the filet.

32:01.986 --> 32:03.019
Thank you, chef.

32:03.020 --> 32:04.154
(Announcer) Food is now flying

32:04.155 --> 32:06.086
out of both kitchens.

32:06.087 --> 32:07.786
That's really good.

32:07.787 --> 32:10.286
Wow, that's quite different
than what I thought.

32:10.287 --> 32:11.854
All of you, come here.
All of you, hurry up!

32:11.855 --> 32:13.486
Right now, it's neck and neck.

32:13.487 --> 32:14.552
There's three tickets left for you,

32:14.553 --> 32:15.552
and three tickets left for you.

32:15.553 --> 32:16.752
Come on, let's go!

32:16.753 --> 32:18.021
(Announcer) And with major bragging rights

32:18.022 --> 32:19.019
on the line...

32:19.020 --> 32:20.187
Out of my [Bleep] way then!

32:20.188 --> 32:21.786
(Announcer) It's anybody's game.

32:21.787 --> 32:22.953
(Paul) Go, go!

32:22.954 --> 32:24.552
Immediately go with two more bronzini.

32:24.553 --> 32:25.619
Four bronzini all day.

32:25.620 --> 32:26.719
We all know what the all day is,

32:26.720 --> 32:27.819
just get the [Bleep] up.

32:27.820 --> 32:28.885
Tuna, beef, lamb. How long?

32:28.886 --> 32:30.085
One of everything!

32:30.086 --> 32:31.319
If someone can help me,

32:31.320 --> 32:32.452
we'd be out of here in, like two seconds.

32:32.453 --> 32:33.719
Push it out, you guys.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.854
Watch your back, watch your back!

32:34.855 --> 32:37.421
Coming down, coming down, coming down.

32:38.654 --> 32:40.353
It's just stone cold.

32:40.354 --> 32:42.353
All of you, come here! All of you!

32:42.354 --> 32:43.819
Just touch that. Don't be scared.

32:43.820 --> 32:44.921
I'm not going to hurt you.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.053
No, it's... stone [Bleep] cold!

32:47.054 --> 32:48.185
I don't understand.

32:48.186 --> 32:49.485
I need to [Bleep] win a service.

32:49.486 --> 32:50.785
Get your [Bleep] together, put the bok choy

32:50.786 --> 32:52.452
in the [Bleep] damn Pan,
get it hot, let's go.

32:52.453 --> 32:53.585
Give them to me, Paul. Give them to me.

32:53.586 --> 32:54.985
In no way, shape, or form at that moment

32:54.986 --> 32:56.152
did my heart sink.

32:56.153 --> 32:57.585
The only thing that it did was make me

32:57.586 --> 32:59.521
grab that Pan and put it
on fire and do it myself.

33:00.954 --> 33:02.586
One minute to the window, chef!

33:02.587 --> 33:04.485
Wait, wait, wait, wait, give me a minute!

33:04.486 --> 33:05.885
Come on, guys. We're almost there.

33:05.886 --> 33:07.152
Two tickets left.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.821
I want to win so [Bleep] bad right now.

33:08.822 --> 33:10.486
Men, let's go, let's go!

33:10.487 --> 33:11.886
Service, please.

33:11.887 --> 33:13.053
Elise! Go, go.

33:13.054 --> 33:14.219
Right behind, right behind. Coming behind.

33:14.220 --> 33:15.352
Pickup, let's go.

33:15.353 --> 33:16.787
Come on, guys. Let's finish strong.

33:16.788 --> 33:18.353
Last ticket, guys.   yes, chef.

33:18.354 --> 33:20.019
They're on their last
ticket, and so are you.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.387
Let's show them what's what.

33:21.388 --> 33:23.420
Two filet ready to go.
Let's not [Bleep] around.

33:23.421 --> 33:25.021
Let's get this out now. Come on, guys!

33:25.022 --> 33:26.820
30 seconds on garnish. 30 seconds.

33:26.821 --> 33:29.053
Go, please.

33:29.054 --> 33:30.820
Good job. Good job.

33:30.821 --> 33:32.021
Shake hands. Thank you very much.

33:32.022 --> 33:33.853
Good job, guys! Come on.

33:33.854 --> 33:35.721
Come here quickly. Come around quickly.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.120
Tonight proved that you

33:37.121 --> 33:39.019
are all worthy of wearing a black jacket.

33:39.020 --> 33:40.685
Now I've got some serious thinking to do.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.054
Clear down. Good job, well done.

33:42.055 --> 33:45.586
(All) Yes, chef.

33:46.356 --> 33:48.055
Okay.

33:48.056 --> 33:50.722
Both kitchens   performed quite well.

33:50.723 --> 33:52.390
As a matter of fact, I've gone through

33:52.391 --> 33:54.522
each and every customer   comment card.

33:54.523 --> 33:56.355
Yes?

33:56.356 --> 33:57.755
There is one question

33:57.756 --> 34:02.556
on the comment card that
determines tonight's winner.

34:04.256 --> 34:07.722
It's the fairest way   I could decide.

34:07.723 --> 34:08.723
The question is

34:08.724 --> 34:11.589
"would you return?"

34:11.590 --> 34:15.590
In one kitchen,   80% of your diners

34:16.856 --> 34:19.822
said they would return.

34:22.656 --> 34:25.089
In the other kitchen,

34:25.090 --> 34:29.022
96% of the customers...
[Whistles and chatter]

34:29.023 --> 34:32.522
Said they would return.

34:32.523 --> 34:36.523
The winning team tonight is...

34:37.356 --> 34:39.956
[Indistinct]

34:42.917 --> 34:45.716
(Announcer) Both the newly-formed
black team and the returning chefs

34:45.717 --> 34:47.516
had strong services,

34:47.516 --> 34:49.315
and chef Ramsay has decided to use

34:49.317 --> 34:53.315
customer comment cards to
determine the winning team.

34:53.317 --> 34:54.516
(Gordon)   in one kitchen,

34:54.518 --> 34:58.282
96% of the customers...
[Whistles and chatter]

34:58.283 --> 35:00.382
Said they would return.

35:00.383 --> 35:04.050
The winning team tonight is...

35:05.517 --> 35:09.282
Current chefs! [All cheering]

35:09.283 --> 35:11.616
[Overlapping chatter]

35:11.617 --> 35:13.416
Oh, my God. This is awesome.

35:13.417 --> 35:15.549
Like I said, cream rises to the top.

35:15.550 --> 35:17.616
(Gordon)   I must say a big thank you

35:17.617 --> 35:19.049
to our returning chefs.

35:19.050 --> 35:20.116
Great job.

35:20.117 --> 35:22.082
(Jennifer)   thank you, guys.

35:22.083 --> 35:24.282
(Gordon)   it was an absolute pleasure.

35:24.283 --> 35:26.050
But get the hell out of Hell's Kitchen.

35:26.051 --> 35:27.149
Let's go!

35:27.150 --> 35:29.016
[Overlapping chatter]

35:29.017 --> 35:30.649
(Van) About right now, m frustrated

35:30.650 --> 35:32.050
this is my second chance,

35:32.051 --> 35:34.016
and I still can't shine, man.

35:34.017 --> 35:35.849
But let them have it.

35:35.850 --> 35:38.082
I'm executive chef, baby.
I'm executive now!

35:38.083 --> 35:39.917
(Gordon)   okay, here's where   it gets

35:39.918 --> 35:43.182
a little bit sad.

35:43.183 --> 35:45.049
Because unfortunately,

35:45.050 --> 35:47.016
I need you to go back to the dorm

35:47.017 --> 35:49.582
and give me the name   of two people

35:49.583 --> 35:50.883
that should be up for elimination.

35:50.884 --> 35:52.516
What?

35:52.517 --> 35:54.149
(Gordon)   go upstairs.

35:54.150 --> 35:57.350
You got some serious talking to do.

36:00.417 --> 36:02.748
(Tommy) It sucks knowing
that somebody has to leave

36:02.749 --> 36:03.750
after we've had a good service.

36:03.751 --> 36:05.849
But it's a competition,

36:05.850 --> 36:09.316
and someone's always got to go.

36:09.317 --> 36:10.350
All right, I'll go first just because

36:10.351 --> 36:12.082
I hate talking about this [Bleep].

36:12.083 --> 36:14.416
Paul had a lobster come back.

36:14.417 --> 36:16.116
Jennifer had a bok choy come back.

36:16.117 --> 36:18.516
Will? Jenn...

36:18.517 --> 36:19.916
And I'm gonna say Elise,

36:19.917 --> 36:22.982
based on the fact that
it was so difficult

36:22.983 --> 36:24.615
to come up with something as stupid

36:24.616 --> 36:26.048
as conceptualizing a menu.

36:26.049 --> 36:28.248
But we came up with a menu and
it was a good menu, so...

36:28.249 --> 36:29.848
But it was like pulling teeth.
But I didn't make   any mistakes,

36:29.849 --> 36:31.315
so you can vote for whoever you want.

36:31.316 --> 36:33.050
I'm voting for Elise because I think she's

36:33.051 --> 36:35.316
[bleep] Detrimental to the team.

36:35.317 --> 36:36.982
That's [Bleep].

36:36.983 --> 36:38.681
I didn't have any mistakes tonight.

36:38.682 --> 36:39.815
You [Bleep] asked everybody in the kitchen

36:39.816 --> 36:40.917
if your steaks were on temp.

36:40.918 --> 36:43.149
No, I asked one steak...

36:43.150 --> 36:44.815
You asked three... you're a [Bleep] liar.

36:44.816 --> 36:46.181
No, I'm not a liar.
I asked you one [Bleep] steak

36:46.182 --> 36:47.515
if you thought it was over.

36:47.516 --> 36:49.348
One [Bleep] steak.
It was three times, Elise.

36:49.349 --> 36:50.517
I asked you once!

36:50.518 --> 36:51.682
Paul.   yeah?

36:51.683 --> 36:53.317
This one's perfect, right? Yes or no?

36:53.318 --> 36:54.382
Yes, yes.

36:54.383 --> 36:56.416
That looks good to you? Yes.

36:56.417 --> 36:57.917
You think that's medium,
or you think that's okay?

36:57.918 --> 36:59.516
I think it's fine.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.116
You want to put me out
because you're scared. No.

37:02.117 --> 37:04.017
I... I Will beat you. If I don't go home...

37:04.018 --> 37:06.182
If I don't go home, you better watch it.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.982
[Overlapping arguing]

37:08.983 --> 37:10.348
You're intimidated. Yeah, you are.

37:10.349 --> 37:11.615
Elise, you are cancer.

37:11.616 --> 37:12.617
Your [Bleep] dish at the
challenge yesterday

37:12.618 --> 37:13.816
was [Bleep].

37:13.817 --> 37:15.750
You keep making the same
[Bleep] over and over again

37:15.751 --> 37:18.016
because you don't have
no [Bleep] creativity.

37:18.017 --> 37:20.049
Hold on, wait, let's
squeeze a [Bleep] lemon

37:20.050 --> 37:21.350
and put some pieces of bread
on it and that's fine.

37:21.351 --> 37:23.049
Oh, yeah, whatever. [Bleep]

37:23.050 --> 37:24.483
Go [Bleep] yourself, Elise.
I'll see you later. Whatever.

37:26.150 --> 37:27.750
Diplomacy is over.

37:29.683 --> 37:33.282
(Jennifer) All I can think
is, "I could be going home."

37:33.283 --> 37:34.650
I don't want to look back

37:34.651 --> 37:36.282
and say, "I should've done this."

37:36.283 --> 37:37.683
I'm gonna say what I have to say.

37:37.684 --> 37:40.583
Hey, can I talk to you
alone for a minute? Yes.

37:44.283 --> 37:46.750
Well, before I leave, 'cause
I feel like I'm going home...

37:46.751 --> 37:50.116
Um, I think   you are adorable.

37:50.117 --> 37:52.216
And I've had a huge crush   on you

37:52.217 --> 37:54.182
from day one. Aw, you're so cute.

37:54.183 --> 37:56.349
I love you, too, Jen. [Laughing]

37:56.350 --> 37:58.148
But you're from Boston,
and I'm from New York.

37:58.149 --> 38:00.017
It's not gonna work, but
I love you, anyway.

38:00.018 --> 38:01.849
Come here. Come here, love.

38:01.850 --> 38:03.216
Aw.

38:03.217 --> 38:04.949
Ooh.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.816
(Jennifer) I am so embarrassed right now.

38:07.817 --> 38:10.516
Gym socks loves me.

38:10.517 --> 38:12.449
She wants to hug me.

38:12.450 --> 38:15.483
I am adorable.

38:26.050 --> 38:27.982
Elise...

38:27.983 --> 38:30.816
First nominee, and why, please?

38:30.817 --> 38:32.449
Jennifer, chef... [sighs]

38:32.450 --> 38:35.182
Because Jennifer had
food come back tonight.

38:35.183 --> 38:36.783
Team's second nominee...

38:54.717 --> 38:57.816
(Announcer) The chefs successfully
completed their first dinner service

38:57.817 --> 38:59.050
as the black team,

38:59.051 --> 39:01.549
and they defeated the
team of returning chefs.

39:01.550 --> 39:03.982
But chef Ramsay asked for two nominees.

39:03.983 --> 39:05.749
The first one is...

39:05.750 --> 39:08.882
Jennifer, chef. [Sighs]

39:08.883 --> 39:11.317
Team's second nominee...

39:15.050 --> 39:17.016
Me, chef.

39:17.017 --> 39:19.049
Excuse me? Myself.

39:19.050 --> 39:22.549
Why? Because I'm overly abrasive.

39:22.550 --> 39:25.782
Overly abrasive? Yep.

39:25.783 --> 39:28.617
Okay, Elise, Jennifer,
step forward, please.

39:34.417 --> 39:36.148
Jennifer,   tell me why you think

39:36.149 --> 39:37.548
you should stay in Hell's Kitchen.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.115
Chef, I think I should
stay in Hell's Kitchen,

39:39.116 --> 39:40.783
because I have so much more to show you.

39:40.784 --> 39:42.849
I think I'm a better chef than Elise.

39:42.850 --> 39:45.049
I think I have better leadership skills.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.449
I'm here to show you

39:46.450 --> 39:47.882
that I can be a leader.

39:47.883 --> 39:49.949
Truthfully, for me, on a personal note,

39:49.950 --> 39:51.549
you're just a little too quiet.

39:51.550 --> 39:53.549
Elise, why do you think   you should stay

39:53.550 --> 39:54.681
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:54.682 --> 39:55.881
Chef, I think I should
stay in Hell's Kitchen,

39:55.882 --> 39:57.217
you're looking for someone who takes charge

39:57.218 --> 39:58.816
and can deliver,

39:58.817 --> 40:00.050
and that's me.

40:01.650 --> 40:03.882
I'm up here because they're intimidated.

40:03.883 --> 40:05.182
They're not intimidated.

40:05.183 --> 40:06.950
Yes, they are. Yes, they are. They're not.

40:06.951 --> 40:09.549
I can be less abrasive,

40:09.550 --> 40:11.115
but one thing I'll never be is a follower,

40:11.116 --> 40:13.081
like some people that are still here are.

40:13.082 --> 40:14.883
Dude, honestly, get over yourself.
Enough.

40:16.183 --> 40:17.317
Okay.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.217
My decision is...

40:23.250 --> 40:25.516
[Sighs]

40:25.517 --> 40:26.982
[Sighs]

40:26.983 --> 40:28.549
Jennifer...

40:28.550 --> 40:30.517
Take off your jacket. What?

40:31.817 --> 40:34.049
Listen to me.

40:34.050 --> 40:37.749
This jacket is filthy dirty.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.316
Get this one on

40:39.317 --> 40:41.617
and get back in line. Oh, my God.

40:43.250 --> 40:44.817
Wow.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.183
Elise...

40:48.950 --> 40:52.349
Let me tell you something
really important.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.782
No one performed

40:53.783 --> 40:56.982
in such a way that they deserved
to leave this competition.

40:56.983 --> 40:59.782
You have   one more chance.

40:59.783 --> 41:00.817
Get back in line.

41:00.818 --> 41:02.150
What the [Bleep]?

41:05.617 --> 41:09.382
I brought in competition

41:09.383 --> 41:11.716
to raise your game.

41:11.717 --> 41:15.082
And tonight you made me proud.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.582
Good job tonight. Thank you, chef.

41:16.583 --> 41:18.316
Get out of here.

41:18.317 --> 41:21.016
They're mad because I won't
let them push me around.

41:21.017 --> 41:22.916
I don't care about any of them.

41:22.917 --> 41:24.117
I'm here for me...

41:24.118 --> 41:25.682
Not for them, for me.

41:25.683 --> 41:27.682
(Paul) Elise's problem

41:27.683 --> 41:29.150
is that she trusts absolutely nobody else.

41:29.151 --> 41:31.650
You can't be a good leader
unless you know how to follow.

41:31.651 --> 41:33.849
She's not gonna win Hell's Kitchen.

41:33.850 --> 41:36.316
I'll be damned if I let that happen.

41:36.317 --> 41:38.416
I am so embarrassed right now.

41:38.417 --> 41:41.649
I shouldn't have told Paul, but I did.

41:41.650 --> 41:43.882
I'll never live this down at all.

41:43.883 --> 41:47.649
(Gordon) Tonight's service was
the best yet in Hell's Kitchen.

41:47.650 --> 41:50.316
Just like the returning chefs
received a second chance,

41:50.317 --> 41:52.482
I decided to give Elise and Jennifer

41:52.483 --> 41:54.049
a second chance as well.

41:54.050 --> 41:56.650
Hopefully they'll make the most of it.

(Announcer) Next time on  Hell's Kitchen...

42:02.704 --> 42:04.769
You thought you knew Elise.

42:04.770 --> 42:07.036
Do you take medication? Elise, stop.

42:07.037 --> 42:09.437
Because I think that you are
living in another world.

42:09.438 --> 42:12.203
(Announcer) You thought you'd
seen her at her worst.

42:12.204 --> 42:13.870
(Gordon) Tonight's service was
the best yet in Hell's Kitchen.

42:13.871 --> 42:16.303
But, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet.

42:16.304 --> 42:19.003
I told you two minutes ago. Don't start.

42:19.004 --> 42:20.636
Get off my stove. Get off of it.

42:20.637 --> 42:23.236
You got to get out of my space.
Are you [Bleep] kidding me?

42:23.237 --> 42:26.336
(Announcer) Can anyone stop
the diva chef from hell?

42:26.337 --> 42:27.703
Oh, hell, no.

42:27.704 --> 42:30.203
(Gordon) A [Bleep] Table.Te

42:30.204 --> 42:31.503
no one's picking it up!

42:31.504 --> 42:33.404
We're waiting on her. For a change.

42:33.405 --> 42:35.869
Watch her throw a tantrum now.

42:35.870 --> 42:38.703
[Bleep] You. [Bleep] You.
And [Bleep] You, too.

42:38.704 --> 42:40.769
(Announcer) She will take
the entire kitchen down with her?

42:40.770 --> 42:42.004
When a restaurant   stops serving,

42:42.005 --> 42:44.103
everyone gets [Bleep] fired!

42:44.104 --> 42:45.636
I'm done!

42:45.637 --> 42:47.869
All of you, [Bleep] Off.

42:47.870 --> 42:49.268
(Announcer) Find out next time

42:49.269 --> 42:51.137
on the most intense episode
of  Hell's Kitchen...

42:51.138 --> 42:53.236
Go stick your [Bleep] head in that oven,

42:53.237 --> 42:54.902
and I'll talk to you through
the [Bleep] gas burner.

42:54.903 --> 42:56.170
