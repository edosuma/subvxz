WEBVTT

02:24.003 --> 02:25.470
Hey, what's up, guys?

02:25.504 --> 02:26.939
Hey.

02:33.478 --> 02:34.881
Hey.

02:34.914 --> 02:36.883
Nice car.

02:36.916 --> 02:38.550
Thanks, man.

02:38.583 --> 02:40.452
It's good for a job like this.

02:40.485 --> 02:41.888
Save a lot of money.

02:41.921 --> 02:44.556
And then you can get
a real car.

02:44.589 --> 02:48.393
Yeah, I can't say I've won
very many races in this car.

02:48.426 --> 02:49.962
So what you reading?

02:49.996 --> 02:52.397
Fairy Boy and the Lost Ring.

02:52.430 --> 02:53.431
Check this out.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.967
No, that's The Ring of Kings.

02:55.001 --> 02:57.904
- It's a classic.
- Wait, do you like fantasies?

02:57.937 --> 03:00.907
I was basically addicted
to Man of Quest.

03:00.940 --> 03:03.608
My parents almost sent me
to rehab.

03:03.643 --> 03:08.047
But, yeah, I was an artist
on, um, Elf Queen.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.048
Are you kidding me?

03:09.081 --> 03:10.750
That's the mobile game,
right, with the woman

03:10.783 --> 03:12.617
with the giant, like, uh...

03:12.652 --> 03:14.053
- Gigantic breasts.
- Giant breasts.

03:14.086 --> 03:16.555
Oh my gosh, that's so cool.

03:16.588 --> 03:18.124
Yes, I drew those breasts.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.992
What? No way.

03:20.026 --> 03:22.427
Is that weird
if I say I'm a huge fan

03:22.460 --> 03:23.095
of your breasts?

03:23.129 --> 03:25.363
Yes, it would.

03:26.699 --> 03:28.134
Right.

03:38.177 --> 03:41.948
Hey, so, I'm an artist, too.

03:41.981 --> 03:42.882
I'm just not
a very good drawer,

03:42.915 --> 03:46.518
but I have these ideas
for these stories.

03:46.551 --> 03:48.520
Yeah? Like what?

03:48.553 --> 03:50.522
So there's this one, right,
like a knight,

03:50.555 --> 03:51.924
and he's kind of, like,
down on his luck.

03:51.958 --> 03:53.558
He's a really good guy,
you know,

03:53.592 --> 03:54.961
and things just aren't
really going his way in life...

03:54.994 --> 03:58.898
So when does the knight
drop off the URIDE passengers?

04:10.676 --> 04:12.611
We're here.

04:16.849 --> 04:20.086
Hope you guys enjoyed
your ride.

04:32.164 --> 04:35.567
Hey, um, sorry about
my boyfriend earlier.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.603
He can be kind of...

04:38.638 --> 04:39.672
Yeah, never mind.

04:39.705 --> 04:41.941
Um, anyway,

04:41.974 --> 04:43.743
your story sounds
really awesome.

04:43.776 --> 04:45.811
I think you should
write it down,

04:45.845 --> 04:47.747
you know, make something
out of it.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.750
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

04:50.783 --> 04:53.052
And, uh...

04:53.085 --> 04:54.921
For the trouble.

04:54.954 --> 04:56.689
Thank you.

04:56.722 --> 05:00.558
And that is a really good book,
by the way.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.567
Ooh, ten bucks.

05:11.904 --> 05:14.240
You're not supposed
to tip him.

05:14.273 --> 05:18.811
Hey, it's my money
and I do what I want with it.

05:21.881 --> 05:23.950
He's still here.

05:23.983 --> 05:26.218
He's watching us.

05:26.252 --> 05:28.586
He's probably just making sure
that we get in, okay?

05:28.620 --> 05:30.256
It's polite.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.992
I'm gonna tell him to leave.

05:33.025 --> 05:35.061
Babe...

05:35.094 --> 05:36.528
Come on.

05:36.561 --> 05:39.231
My buzz is wearing off.

05:39.265 --> 05:40.800
Let's go open a bottle of wine
or something.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.234
Come on.

05:42.268 --> 05:44.502
Okay.

06:04.690 --> 06:05.992
Hey, Jesus.

06:06.025 --> 06:07.559
- How you doing, man?
- Hey, I'm good.

06:07.592 --> 06:08.661
What's going on, dude?

06:08.694 --> 06:10.629
- How are you?
- Good.

06:12.231 --> 06:14.734
You know, you're in here
every Friday night.

06:14.767 --> 06:17.169
You know, I'm in here
all the time.

06:17.203 --> 06:21.573
What I'm getting at is, um,
don't you, like, go out,

06:21.606 --> 06:24.043
have fun with friends
or something?

06:24.076 --> 06:25.811
I do, but it's just
that most of my friends

06:25.845 --> 06:27.079
are in college.

06:27.113 --> 06:29.849
Ah, your friends
are children, okay.

06:34.586 --> 06:35.988
Wow.

06:36.022 --> 06:37.757
Hey, you know,
I did meet a girl tonight.

06:37.790 --> 06:40.092
You did? Woo!

06:40.126 --> 06:42.061
What happened?

06:42.094 --> 06:43.629
Is she interested?

06:43.662 --> 06:44.663
I don't know, I hope so.

06:44.697 --> 06:47.833
It's just that, um...

06:47.867 --> 06:50.970
She's got this asshole
boyfriend, you know?

06:51.003 --> 06:53.239
Oh. A boyfriend.

06:55.007 --> 06:58.077
Jesus, you should take
the first exit,

06:58.110 --> 07:01.680
because the vulture game
is kind of a hard road.

07:05.284 --> 07:08.254
I'll beat you,
nosy-ass cashier.

07:34.213 --> 07:35.948
Aren't you gonna have breakfast?

07:35.981 --> 07:37.383
I did.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.919
I had something
at the gas station.

07:39.952 --> 07:41.220
Let me make you something.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.755
I have to go to work, Mom.

07:42.788 --> 07:43.856
You just came from work.

07:43.889 --> 07:45.157
To real work, all right?

07:45.191 --> 07:47.760
Not driving these drunks around

07:47.793 --> 07:50.196
who make fun of my car.

07:50.229 --> 07:52.031
I'm sorry.

07:53.732 --> 07:55.301
Maybe it's time
I call your father.

07:55.334 --> 07:57.803
What? No.

07:57.837 --> 08:01.073
I don't miss that asshole
and neither should you.

08:01.107 --> 08:02.942
- We need him.
- No, we don't.

08:02.975 --> 08:04.677
We never needed him.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.846
All right, I can take care
of everything.

08:06.879 --> 08:09.415
Let me make you an egg.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.016
Fine.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.852
Just one, all right?
Real quick.

08:25.364 --> 08:26.999
Hey, gringo is here.

08:27.032 --> 08:28.367
I told you,
I ain't no gringo, man.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.002
You speak Spanish?

08:30.035 --> 08:31.704
Un poquito.

08:31.737 --> 08:34.340
Just like a gringo.

08:37.376 --> 08:40.146
Hey, Jesus,
go take the barrels out.

08:40.179 --> 08:42.448
Waste management will be by
in an hour to pick 'em up.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.283
All right.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.419
Miguel. Miguel, hey.

08:47.453 --> 08:50.022
Circles.

09:09.275 --> 09:11.710
Long-ass day, man.

09:13.279 --> 09:14.446
Hey, Jesus.

09:16.515 --> 09:17.983
Hey.

09:19.418 --> 09:21.987
- Jesus.
- Huh?

09:22.021 --> 09:24.089
It's a lunchroom.

09:24.123 --> 09:26.392
Yeah.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.105
So tell me
how I'm supposed to feel

09:40.139 --> 09:43.008
when my girlfriend is going
on dates with other guys.

09:43.042 --> 09:46.312
It's a girls' night
with people from work.

09:46.345 --> 09:48.247
If you want to sit around
feeling sorry for yourself,

09:48.280 --> 09:50.516
that's your fault, okay?

09:50.549 --> 09:53.485
Maybe I should go with you.

09:53.519 --> 09:55.387
And how am I supposed
to explain that?

09:57.323 --> 09:58.924
Just send me pictures.

09:58.958 --> 10:01.026
Kaiden, you can trust me.

10:05.831 --> 10:08.767
Why is the guy
from the other night here?

10:08.801 --> 10:10.202
That's just the URIDE driver.

10:10.236 --> 10:12.104
It's not even the same car
as last night.

10:12.137 --> 10:13.806
I know what the car
looked like.

10:17.176 --> 10:19.144
Don't play me.

10:19.178 --> 10:23.215
Don't you dare grab
my fucking hand.

10:28.354 --> 10:31.523
Can we pick somebody up
on our way to the bar, please?

10:31.557 --> 10:32.958
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, let's just get

10:32.992 --> 10:34.560
the fuck out of here.

10:57.082 --> 10:59.885
Hey, uh, would you mind
keeping what happened earlier

10:59.918 --> 11:01.854
just between us two?

11:03.389 --> 11:04.857
Hey, Brianna.

11:04.890 --> 11:08.260
I'm gonna buy you
so many drinks.

11:08.294 --> 11:11.997
Oh, God. What happened?

11:12.031 --> 11:14.466
We didn't get the licensing deal
for Courage Drop.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.303
The author thinks
that video games

11:17.336 --> 11:20.472
are not a dignified medium
for her work.

11:20.506 --> 11:22.241
Fucking start-ups, man.

11:27.446 --> 11:29.248
So when is the new launch date?

11:29.281 --> 11:30.983
Well, the game is ready,

11:31.016 --> 11:34.320
uh, except for the story tweaks
and the new art

11:34.353 --> 11:36.255
so we don't have to delay
the launch.

11:36.288 --> 11:39.325
Dammit, Diane, you need
an entire year's worth of art

11:39.358 --> 11:41.193
in a month?

11:44.029 --> 11:48.033
You're gonna buy me
every single drink.

11:50.069 --> 11:52.004
So how's Kaiden?

11:52.037 --> 11:53.872
He's fine.

11:53.906 --> 11:55.441
We're fine.

11:55.474 --> 11:56.475
Let's take a selfie.

12:03.182 --> 12:04.416
So how's your night?

12:04.450 --> 12:07.453
Have any crazy passengers?

12:07.486 --> 12:09.355
Uh, no.

12:09.388 --> 12:12.624
It's been
kind of a quiet night.

12:26.338 --> 12:27.439
You know, I just want
to get fucked up

12:27.473 --> 12:29.174
at this point, okay?

12:29.208 --> 12:30.142
Mel's having a house party.

12:30.175 --> 12:31.343
Let's just go to that.

12:31.377 --> 12:32.945
I'll update the route.

13:00.105 --> 13:01.173
This dress is too tight.

13:01.206 --> 13:03.575
This is what I get for...

13:03.609 --> 13:06.412
Oh my gosh!

13:06.445 --> 13:08.046
I am ready to drink.

13:20.492 --> 13:23.562
Hey. Hey, are you a URIDE?

13:23.595 --> 13:25.431
Hey.

13:25.464 --> 13:27.032
Hey, are you a URIDE?

13:27.065 --> 13:28.534
Look, I'm not working, sorry.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.169
Oh, come on, man.

13:30.202 --> 13:32.471
- Give me a ride, man.
- Use the app,

13:32.504 --> 13:34.139
and somebody will
give you a ride, okay?

13:34.173 --> 13:36.643
Yeah, but you're
right here, man.

13:36.676 --> 13:38.377
Come on, we're...

13:38.410 --> 13:41.380
We're two "condensing" adults
here, right?

13:41.413 --> 13:44.283
I give you the money
and you give me a ride home.

13:44.316 --> 13:48.020
Sorry, but I'm not working.

13:48.053 --> 13:50.222
- Goodbye.
- Come on!

13:50.255 --> 13:52.458
Come on, man! You know...

13:52.491 --> 13:54.661
You're a bitch!

13:54.694 --> 13:55.695
Yeah.

13:55.728 --> 13:57.630
You're a bitch.

14:57.422 --> 14:58.457
Who's this?

14:58.490 --> 15:00.425
You look familiar.

15:01.593 --> 15:02.629
Well, that was fast.

15:02.662 --> 15:04.664
Were you waiting for us?

15:04.697 --> 15:07.599
No. It's just a slow night.

15:07.634 --> 15:08.835
It's a Saturday.

15:21.848 --> 15:24.483
Sorry, I crossed the line.

15:24.516 --> 15:26.719
I just want you to be happy.

15:26.753 --> 15:29.154
I am happy.

15:46.438 --> 15:48.440
Ugh.

15:54.781 --> 15:56.548
Are you coming?

15:56.582 --> 15:57.817
What?

15:57.850 --> 15:59.418
Oh, no, no, no.

15:59.451 --> 16:01.420
I have to get home to...

16:01.453 --> 16:04.857
I think it's best
if you just come with me.

16:04.891 --> 16:09.629
No, Diane, I can't
just stay out all night, okay?

16:09.662 --> 16:10.863
Okay, you're a grown woman.

16:10.897 --> 16:11.965
You don't have to do anything.

16:11.998 --> 16:15.334
It's okay. I can make sure
she gets home safe.

16:15.367 --> 16:17.202
Ugh.

16:17.235 --> 16:18.403
He's fine, okay?

16:18.437 --> 16:20.505
He's... he's writing a book

16:20.539 --> 16:22.875
and he's reading a book
that I like,

16:22.909 --> 16:27.814
and I actually think
that you really like him.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.851
Look, I'm not gonna fuck you
or anything.

16:31.884 --> 16:34.486
Get home safe, Brianna.

16:46.633 --> 16:51.603
Do you ever feel
like nobody wants you?

16:51.638 --> 16:54.641
I'm sure people want you.

16:54.674 --> 16:58.911
No, they just want
something from me.

16:58.945 --> 17:01.848
Like, sex or something?

17:01.881 --> 17:04.884
Yeah, but...

17:04.917 --> 17:07.452
Sex is easy.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.389
Yeah, I can relate.

17:10.422 --> 17:13.726
I mean with people using you.

17:15.494 --> 17:18.530
You know, at both my jobs,

17:18.563 --> 17:21.600
people don't even look me
in the eye anymore.

17:21.634 --> 17:24.469
I'm just like this donkey
pulling a cart, you know?

17:27.372 --> 17:29.441
I love my boyfriend.

17:29.474 --> 17:33.345
I just wish he was
someone else sometimes.

17:34.914 --> 17:36.214
So why don't you just do it,
why don't you just leave

17:36.248 --> 17:37.382
your boyfriend?

17:40.887 --> 17:42.689
I'm...

17:42.722 --> 17:44.957
I'm tired.

18:11.416 --> 18:12.284
Whoa, whoa, whoa, careful.

18:12.317 --> 18:13.720
I'm okay.

18:13.753 --> 18:15.888
I got it, I got it.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.829
What do you think
of my friend, Diane?

18:24.396 --> 18:28.433
I mean, she's all right.

18:28.467 --> 18:31.904
Well, she thinks
you're really cute.

18:33.538 --> 18:37.043
Doesn't she, like,
have a thing for you?

18:37.076 --> 18:38.678
I mean...

18:38.711 --> 18:40.345
She has a crush on everyone.

18:40.378 --> 18:42.749
She's kind of just,
like, in love

18:42.782 --> 18:44.751
with being in love, you know?

18:46.018 --> 18:47.987
I mean, is that
such a bad thing?

18:48.020 --> 18:50.422
If you started just working
around her house

18:50.455 --> 18:51.924
and driving around there,
I'm sure that you would

18:51.958 --> 18:54.426
pick her up sooner or later.

18:55.661 --> 18:57.697
Thanks, but, um...

18:59.531 --> 19:03.703
I kind of have my heart
set on someone else.

19:06.806 --> 19:08.406
Oh...

19:08.440 --> 19:10.509
Um...

19:10.542 --> 19:12.577
It's okay. Don't...

19:12.611 --> 19:14.446
- Don't worry about it.
- It's for the ride.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.551
Thanks.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.589
Get in safe.

19:43.843 --> 19:47.013
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just the URIDE driver.

19:47.046 --> 19:49.816
- I know what the fuck you are.
- Okay, look, she was drunk.

19:49.849 --> 19:52.517
- You were gonna fuck her?
- You're crazy.

19:55.888 --> 19:59.058
If I see you around here again,
I'll kill you.

20:06.699 --> 20:11.103
Fucking hit me? Oh, she don't
even fucking love you.

20:11.137 --> 20:13.072
So don't fuck with me!

20:13.105 --> 20:14.539
Huh?

20:14.573 --> 20:15.540
Try to fucking touch me,

20:15.574 --> 20:18.376
I'll take your fucking life,
motherfucker!

20:18.410 --> 20:19.745
Fuck you!

20:40.132 --> 20:42.134
Hey there...

20:42.168 --> 20:44.170
...Scarface.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.772
You're looking
a bit underdressed today.

20:46.806 --> 20:48.074
Where's your gear?

20:48.107 --> 20:50.475
Oh, come on.

20:50.508 --> 20:52.611
It's just one day.

20:52.645 --> 20:55.181
How's it gonna look if I keep
playing favorites with you?

20:55.214 --> 20:58.684
Okay, look, just... I can
go home real quick, all right?

20:58.718 --> 21:03.055
Or better yet, look, I can
just borrow a vest and a hat.

21:03.089 --> 21:05.057
Please, come on,
I need the hours.

21:05.091 --> 21:06.792
Please, please, please.

21:06.826 --> 21:09.128
All right, look, uh,
I was gonna send you

21:09.161 --> 21:13.465
to the store anyway,
so take the company card,

21:13.498 --> 21:15.500
go pick up the product
at the store,

21:15.533 --> 21:16.601
then get your shit.

21:16.636 --> 21:18.536
Oh, thank you so much.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.172
- Thank you.
- It's fine, all right?

21:20.206 --> 21:23.175
You're not like the other guys.

21:23.209 --> 21:25.177
- Huh.
- Hey, if we have a problem,

21:25.211 --> 21:27.113
I can send Mr. White.

21:28.814 --> 21:30.016
Oh, no, no, no.

21:30.049 --> 21:32.118
Look, I appreciate
the second chance, okay?

21:32.151 --> 21:34.720
Thank you so much, thank you.

21:34.754 --> 21:36.155
Fucking asshole.

21:36.188 --> 21:37.857
Hey, and, kid,

21:37.890 --> 21:39.158
there's no place in America
for someone

21:39.191 --> 21:40.793
who can't take a compliment.

21:52.504 --> 21:53.839
You're jumpy.

21:53.873 --> 21:57.542
Yeah, well, I wasn't
really expecting anyone.

21:57.575 --> 21:58.978
Well, I thought
you'd want to go for a run

21:59.011 --> 22:01.747
or maybe watch a movie.

22:03.581 --> 22:05.184
I'm tired.

22:06.886 --> 22:08.988
I thought that'd be
your answer,

22:09.021 --> 22:12.091
which is why
I brought you coffee.

22:12.124 --> 22:16.494
Oh, you are a beautiful man.

22:21.901 --> 22:24.170
So how was last night?

22:24.203 --> 22:26.205
It was good.

22:26.238 --> 22:28.908
Anything interesting happen?

22:32.845 --> 22:34.714
No.

22:34.747 --> 22:36.983
Not really, just...

22:37.016 --> 22:39.551
...too many drinks.

22:41.020 --> 22:44.290
Diane finally made
a pass at me, though.

22:44.323 --> 22:48.526
We fought about it,
but I think we'll be okay.

22:50.763 --> 22:53.531
Did you not sleep
in your pajamas?

22:53.565 --> 22:55.835
Hey, I barely got
out of my clothes.

22:55.868 --> 22:57.136
I didn't make it to bed.

23:01.073 --> 23:03.709
My head hurts.

23:03.743 --> 23:05.311
Let me.

23:24.330 --> 23:26.632
What time did you get home?

23:26.665 --> 23:29.135
Mm, I don't know.

23:29.168 --> 23:32.071
Like, midnight maybe?

23:34.240 --> 23:36.776
Did you take a URIDE back?

23:36.809 --> 23:37.843
Yeah.

23:37.877 --> 23:40.679
Sure as hell wasn't driving.

23:40.713 --> 23:42.281
Why?

23:45.818 --> 23:47.953
No reason.

23:50.656 --> 23:53.225
Tired of driving
your rough commute to work?

23:53.259 --> 23:55.828
A URIDE will come
right to your door,

23:55.861 --> 23:59.665
driven by one of our many
Class A/Class C drivers.

23:59.698 --> 24:02.835
Download the app
and start your ride today.

24:02.868 --> 24:06.906
And now, a look at last night
with our Morning Rewind.

24:06.939 --> 24:08.140
We're looking for
a white Chevy Camaro

24:08.174 --> 24:09.775
that ran a Toyota Prius
off the road

24:09.809 --> 24:11.377
off of Mill Creek
and First Street.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.345
He then stared the victim down
and left.

24:13.379 --> 24:14.980
The motive is unknown,
but this is

24:15.014 --> 24:17.049
the second such report
we've received.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.151
- No further questions.
- You okay?

24:19.185 --> 24:20.986
What happened?

24:21.020 --> 24:22.620
I'm fine.

24:22.655 --> 24:25.091
I just... I forgot my shit.

25:13.739 --> 25:16.208
- Is that everything?
- Uh-huh.

25:22.214 --> 25:24.016
We want to send
a special shout-out

25:24.049 --> 25:27.686
to all the drivers out there
doing good work.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.954
Ah!

25:28.988 --> 25:31.123
Do we want to send out
a shout-out

25:31.157 --> 25:33.759
to the drivers
who are not doing good.

25:33.792 --> 25:36.228
Hey, drivers out there...

25:36.262 --> 25:37.897
- Jesus?
- Michael?

25:37.930 --> 25:39.098
- Yeah.
- All right, Mike,

25:39.131 --> 25:40.065
how's it going today?

25:40.099 --> 25:41.333
It's awesome, thanks.

25:41.367 --> 25:43.769
- We're heading to Akbar?
- Yeah.

25:43.802 --> 25:45.004
You should have it on your...

25:45.037 --> 25:46.705
Yeah, no, no, no, I got it.

25:46.739 --> 25:49.275
Got it right here.

25:49.308 --> 25:50.843
So we're meeting up
with friends tonight

25:50.876 --> 25:52.077
or what's going on?

25:52.111 --> 25:55.014
- Uh, just, yeah.
- All right.

26:04.790 --> 26:07.259
So, do you, like,
hate your life?

26:08.961 --> 26:11.430
Did you want to be
a URIDE driver?

26:11.463 --> 26:14.867
Nobody wants to be
a URIDE driver, stupid.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.302
I don't know.

26:16.335 --> 26:18.737
It seems fun.

26:18.771 --> 26:21.807
So, what went wrong
in your life?

26:21.840 --> 26:23.909
Are you a virgin?

26:27.213 --> 26:31.283
Um, are you aware
there's a pipe back here?

26:36.355 --> 26:38.090
Thank you, Jeeves.

26:38.123 --> 26:41.493
It's so awkward
when they don't talk.

26:56.575 --> 26:59.111
Why do you have to make
everything a fight?

26:59.144 --> 27:01.513
I'm not trying to fight
right now, babe.

27:01.547 --> 27:03.015
It's just I wasn't
expecting you

27:03.048 --> 27:03.916
to come over today and, look,

27:03.949 --> 27:06.385
I'm really glad
that you did, okay?

27:06.418 --> 27:11.123
But I just need to take care
of real-life bullshit now,

27:11.156 --> 27:12.992
you know?

27:13.025 --> 27:17.129
So you were happy I came
and now you want me to go.

27:24.903 --> 27:26.038
Yes, Kaiden.

27:26.071 --> 27:27.406
I called a URIDE, okay?

27:27.439 --> 27:29.341
That's a perfectly normal thing
to do.

27:29.375 --> 27:32.144
Okay, and you called
the same guy.

27:32.177 --> 27:35.547
I just pick whichever driver
is closest to me, okay?

27:35.581 --> 27:37.483
You always get
the same black Prius.

27:37.516 --> 27:40.219
Oh. Okay, yeah, you caught me.

27:40.252 --> 27:42.988
I just call the same guy
every single time.

27:43.022 --> 27:46.091
Hm, I wonder why a woman
would continue to hire

27:46.125 --> 27:49.528
the same person that she knows
isn't a murderer or a rapist

27:49.561 --> 27:51.563
instead of taking a chance
with some random stranger?

27:51.597 --> 27:55.301
Clearly, the only answer
is that she wants to fuck him.

27:55.334 --> 27:56.602
So you want to fuck him.

27:56.636 --> 28:00.139
Oh my God, you pathetic,
insecure motherfucker.

28:00.172 --> 28:01.540
Why won't you trust me?

28:01.573 --> 28:03.409
How can I trust you?

28:03.442 --> 28:05.978
All you do is lie to me.

28:06.011 --> 28:07.913
About the cabs that I get.

28:11.283 --> 28:13.018
You said you came home
at midnight,

28:13.052 --> 28:14.453
but I saw him
leaving your place

28:14.486 --> 28:17.156
- at 1:00 in the morning.
- Oh my God, I was drunk, okay?

28:17.189 --> 28:19.124
I'm sorry I don't remember
exactly what time

28:19.158 --> 28:20.893
I got home last night.

28:20.926 --> 28:22.261
Why was he here?

28:22.294 --> 28:24.196
He wasn't even inside!

28:24.229 --> 28:25.998
I know what I saw.

28:26.031 --> 28:28.367
You know, I would get
really mad at you

28:28.400 --> 28:31.303
for spying on me again,
but if you were spying on me,

28:31.337 --> 28:33.339
you would know what happened.

28:33.372 --> 28:35.240
So what happened?

28:35.274 --> 28:36.942
Nothing!

28:36.975 --> 28:39.244
You are crazy.

28:39.278 --> 28:41.480
Please, don't do this.

28:41.513 --> 28:43.449
Hey!

28:43.482 --> 28:45.250
Hey, leave her alone.

28:45.284 --> 28:47.986
I thought I taught you not
to come around here anymore.

28:48.020 --> 28:49.221
What do you think you're doing?

28:49.254 --> 28:53.058
I just want to go to the store.

28:53.092 --> 28:55.227
Don't you dare go with him.

28:55.260 --> 28:57.496
God, babe, I think
you should just go home.

28:57.529 --> 28:59.031
What's that supposed to mean?

28:59.064 --> 29:03.435
Just don't be here
when I get back.

29:29.995 --> 29:33.666
Sorry you had
to go through that tonight.

29:33.700 --> 29:37.102
No, I'm sorry I dragged you
through my drama, so...

29:37.136 --> 29:39.639
Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

29:42.341 --> 29:44.343
Why am I with that asshole?

29:44.376 --> 29:46.646
Why are you with that asshole?

29:46.679 --> 29:49.148
You're right,
that is a personal question.

29:49.181 --> 29:51.483
Okay, what is it?
What's the answer?

29:51.517 --> 29:53.285
I love him? I don't know.

29:53.318 --> 29:55.254
Bullshit.

29:55.287 --> 29:57.156
What do you love about him,
the paranoia

29:57.189 --> 29:59.391
or the homicidal violence
from the paranoia?

29:59.425 --> 30:01.126
Can we just not do this
right now?

30:01.160 --> 30:03.362
Okay, I've had a bad day,
I'm hungry,

30:03.395 --> 30:05.264
and I just want
to get some food.

30:18.110 --> 30:21.180
So I was thinking
maybe after everything,

30:21.213 --> 30:25.017
tonight could be a sit-down
restaurant type of night.

30:25.050 --> 30:26.418
I'm not dressed for it.

30:26.452 --> 30:28.554
Or...

30:28.587 --> 30:32.057
Not sit-down restaurant,
not fast food place.

30:36.361 --> 30:38.197
My treat.

30:38.230 --> 30:39.331
I don't want to be
a burden, okay?

30:39.364 --> 30:41.133
What? No.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.301
Not a problem at all.

30:42.334 --> 30:44.436
Look, I got this client, right,

30:44.470 --> 30:47.406
and she tips me really well,

30:47.439 --> 30:50.677
so technically,
she's paying for it.

30:50.710 --> 30:51.811
Oh, yeah?

30:51.845 --> 30:53.780
Why don't you tell me
about this client of yours?

30:53.813 --> 30:54.747
Oh, no, no, no.

30:54.781 --> 30:57.483
I can't talk about that.

30:57.516 --> 30:59.752
I took a sacred oath,
all right,

30:59.786 --> 31:02.755
to never talk about my clients
and never take a tip.

31:06.358 --> 31:08.126
Goodbye, Jesus.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.168
Hey! Hey.

31:18.070 --> 31:19.672
Uh...

31:19.706 --> 31:22.474
Um, you forgot to tip me.

31:22.508 --> 31:25.611
Well, I wouldn't want you
to break your sacred oath.

31:25.645 --> 31:27.814
Sacred oath.

31:27.847 --> 31:30.349
It's more like
a sacred philosophy.

31:30.382 --> 31:32.618
Sacred instruction manual
at best.

31:34.319 --> 31:37.055
Okay.

31:37.089 --> 31:40.058
Look, I know I came off
kind of strong, all right,

31:40.092 --> 31:43.161
but I was just trying
to be funny,

31:43.195 --> 31:46.298
you know, get your mind
off things,

31:46.331 --> 31:49.234
elevate your mood a little bit.

31:49.268 --> 31:52.237
What are you now,
like my therapist?

31:52.271 --> 31:53.673
Sorry.

31:53.706 --> 31:55.642
I should probably
get going now.

31:55.675 --> 31:58.110
Yeah, me too.

32:20.867 --> 32:22.134
Hey.

32:22.167 --> 32:23.736
So...

32:23.770 --> 32:27.674
What's this not sit-down,
not fast food place?

32:27.707 --> 32:29.241
Get in. I'll show you.

32:38.417 --> 32:39.886
What are these?

32:39.919 --> 32:41.486
They're so tiny.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.855
'Cause these are authentic.

32:42.889 --> 32:44.824
Well, that's not acceptable.

32:44.857 --> 32:47.626
I mean, we could just order
a shit ton more.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.697
Now that is acceptable.

32:53.231 --> 32:55.467
You know, if you want
large tacos,

32:55.500 --> 32:57.202
Tacos Grande is the spot.

32:57.235 --> 32:59.471
We should definitely go there
sometime.

32:59.504 --> 33:01.774
Yeah, for sure.

33:03.776 --> 33:05.277
You seem like
you're in a better mood.

33:08.347 --> 33:12.584
Yeah, well, I still have
some thinking to do, you know?

33:12.618 --> 33:15.354
Guess what? I got
the perfect spot for that.

33:32.471 --> 33:34.573
Wow.

33:34.606 --> 33:35.908
So this is it.

33:35.942 --> 33:37.910
This is my favorite spot
in town.

33:37.944 --> 33:42.214
Well, out of town, actually.

33:44.616 --> 33:47.787
It's so quiet up here.

33:47.820 --> 33:50.188
Yeah, I used to come up here
in high school.

33:51.758 --> 33:53.392
And, then, when I first got
my driver's license,

33:53.425 --> 33:55.427
I would just...

33:55.460 --> 33:56.796
...drive around
just to get away

33:56.829 --> 33:58.765
from my problems at home,
you know?

33:58.798 --> 34:02.601
Yeah, nothing
is more complicated than home.

34:06.939 --> 34:08.540
I don't get it,
if you need space,

34:08.573 --> 34:10.242
why are you still with him?

34:12.712 --> 34:13.880
It's hard to explain, okay?

34:13.913 --> 34:16.749
I...

34:16.783 --> 34:19.852
I think of love
as like a contract,

34:19.886 --> 34:21.386
so when you love somebody,

34:21.420 --> 34:24.523
you're bound to them, you know?

34:25.624 --> 34:27.660
That's terrifying.

34:27.694 --> 34:30.595
Maybe that's the difference
between you and me.

34:30.630 --> 34:31.831
I take love seriously.

34:31.864 --> 34:34.701
No, I take love seriously.

34:34.734 --> 34:36.268
No.

34:37.536 --> 34:40.605
Guys always think they do.

34:44.509 --> 34:47.013
I should probably get going.

35:24.316 --> 35:26.786
Huh? What the fuck?

36:03.856 --> 36:05.390
Fuck.

36:15.433 --> 36:17.036
Oh, Jesus.

36:17.069 --> 36:18.771
You're usually in here
for, like,

36:18.805 --> 36:19.872
energy drinks and shit.

36:19.906 --> 36:21.506
What's with the downers?

36:21.540 --> 36:23.910
They're for a party.

36:23.943 --> 36:25.377
Come on, Jesus.

36:25.410 --> 36:28.446
Thirty racks and kegs
are for parties.

36:28.480 --> 36:32.652
Six-packs I like to call
"masturbatory packs."

36:33.753 --> 36:35.788
Get it?

36:35.822 --> 36:36.756
- No?
- Can you

36:36.789 --> 36:39.692
just ring them up, please?

36:39.725 --> 36:41.359
You want to try that again
with some manners?

36:44.496 --> 36:48.000
Look, I'm having
a rough night, okay?

36:48.034 --> 36:50.435
Okay, that's all you had to say.

36:53.039 --> 36:54.372
So is this about that girl

36:54.406 --> 36:56.876
that you've been
vulturing around?

36:56.909 --> 36:59.011
I'm not a fucking vulture, man.

36:59.045 --> 37:01.446
All right, you're right,
that was mean.

37:01.479 --> 37:04.817
Is this about that that girl
you've been circling around,

37:04.851 --> 37:07.086
waiting for her relationship
to die?

37:07.119 --> 37:09.055
Do you ever just focus
on your job?

37:09.088 --> 37:12.424
This job doesn't take
a lot of focus.

37:12.457 --> 37:14.559
There's no one here.

37:16.561 --> 37:18.865
So come on.

37:18.898 --> 37:20.633
It's just that...

37:21.934 --> 37:23.501
...at the end of the night,

37:23.535 --> 37:26.072
she got a ride home
from somebody else.

37:26.105 --> 37:27.807
What do you mean?
Like, her mom?

37:27.840 --> 37:29.775
After our date.

37:31.811 --> 37:32.712
I don't know,
maybe she just felt

37:32.745 --> 37:34.180
like it would be weird
to hire me again,

37:34.213 --> 37:35.982
you know what I mean?

37:36.015 --> 37:38.184
Yeah, it would've been weird.

37:38.217 --> 37:39.819
Why didn't you just
take her home for free

37:39.852 --> 37:41.988
like a gentleman?

37:43.956 --> 37:45.825
Ah.

37:45.858 --> 37:50.428
So for this date, did you
ever use the word "date"?

37:51.463 --> 37:52.698
It was a date.

37:52.732 --> 37:54.466
- I know dates.
- I'm just saying,

37:54.499 --> 37:56.035
sometimes you can be on a date

37:56.068 --> 37:58.905
and, you know,
you think it's going well

37:58.938 --> 38:01.674
and you think
you're gonna get a hand job,

38:01.707 --> 38:03.475
but then she calls the cops.

38:03.508 --> 38:06.879
The point is, she doesn't
think it's a date,

38:06.913 --> 38:10.082
and I think that's
your situation, buddy.

38:11.951 --> 38:14.586
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

38:15.821 --> 38:17.589
Yeah.

38:17.622 --> 38:20.660
Saw 'em at the mall
a couple of months ago.

38:20.693 --> 38:23.461
- Yeah?
- Jesus,

38:23.495 --> 38:24.964
are you still awake?

38:24.997 --> 38:27.465
Yeah.

38:27.499 --> 38:30.136
Are you feeling okay?

38:30.169 --> 38:33.605
Yes, I'm fine, Mom.

38:33.639 --> 38:35.540
Did you take anything?

38:35.573 --> 38:37.243
Yeah.

38:37.276 --> 38:38.711
I'm medicating.

38:38.744 --> 38:41.579
...a month ago
and it still hasn't happened.

38:41.613 --> 38:43.215
What about work?

38:44.984 --> 38:46.986
I called off.

38:47.019 --> 38:47.853
Okay.

38:47.887 --> 38:49.487
You know, your mind
keeps you awake

38:49.521 --> 38:52.224
when you don't have
any time for yourself.

38:52.258 --> 38:54.794
Yes, Mom! Thank you!

38:56.963 --> 38:59.531
Mijo, is there anything
I can do for you?

39:02.168 --> 39:04.170
Jesus?

39:05.905 --> 39:09.507
For the love of God, Mom,
I'm fine, all right?

39:09.541 --> 39:11.644
Just leave me alone!

39:11.677 --> 39:13.545
Jeez!

39:15.815 --> 39:17.283
What about me?

39:27.827 --> 39:30.162
- Hello?
- Hey, Jesus.

39:30.196 --> 39:32.564
I was wondering
if you were coming in today.

39:32.597 --> 39:33.799
I called out sick.

39:33.833 --> 39:35.935
Yeah. Yeah, I got that message.

39:35.968 --> 39:38.671
I was wondering
if you could come in anyway.

39:38.704 --> 39:40.906
I'm sick.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.041
Funny.

39:42.074 --> 39:43.109
You know what else is funny?

39:43.142 --> 39:46.611
It's funny that I thought
you needed this job.

39:54.887 --> 39:57.790
So how's that year's worth
of art coming along?

39:57.823 --> 40:01.227
On a scale of one to 12,
I would say February.

40:01.260 --> 40:02.628
At least it's not a leap year.

40:08.267 --> 40:09.969
I'm sorry about what happened
the other night.

40:12.104 --> 40:15.207
It's cool. I mean, objectively,

40:15.241 --> 40:17.343
it's the least shitty thing
going on in my life

40:17.376 --> 40:19.945
right now, so...

40:19.979 --> 40:21.847
I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

40:23.315 --> 40:25.885
The URIDE driver and Kaiden
almost got into a fight

40:25.918 --> 40:27.186
the other night.

40:27.219 --> 40:29.822
Jesus. Why?

40:29.855 --> 40:34.060
Jesus is kind of a stalker,
and Kaiden's...

40:34.093 --> 40:36.362
Jesus is just too nice of a guy
to start a fight,

40:36.395 --> 40:38.097
so what happened?

40:38.130 --> 40:39.965
I don't want to hear it, Diane.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.667
Okay, he's a really great guy,

40:41.700 --> 40:45.905
and my father gave him
his blessing to marry me.

40:45.938 --> 40:47.940
Why did Kaiden start the fight?

40:47.973 --> 40:50.810
God, I said
nothing happened, okay?

40:52.144 --> 40:55.915
Boys are just crazy.

40:59.418 --> 41:01.287
You know I'm here for you
if you need anything.

41:15.868 --> 41:18.137
So that's why you smell
like cerveza and sadness.

41:20.973 --> 41:23.142
Yeah, I guess I'm not being
that much of a man about it.

41:23.175 --> 41:25.277
Before I got with my girl,

41:25.311 --> 41:27.813
went through shit like that
all the time.

41:27.847 --> 41:29.148
I learned the key is
you got to figure out

41:29.181 --> 41:30.349
if this shit is viable

41:30.382 --> 41:32.318
before you do something stupid.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.989
We went on a date.

41:37.022 --> 41:38.824
How's that not a sign
of viability?

41:38.858 --> 41:41.260
Look, if it were me,
I would try to get in good

41:41.293 --> 41:43.129
with one of her friends,
you know?

41:43.162 --> 41:45.097
The friends will let you know
whether you need to step down

41:45.131 --> 41:46.098
or step up.

41:48.234 --> 41:50.803
That's actually
some good advice.

41:50.836 --> 41:51.770
What do you mean "actually"?

42:05.718 --> 42:07.887
I was hoping I'd get you
one of these days.

42:07.920 --> 42:11.257
Yes, and welcome
to the front seat.

42:12.491 --> 42:14.894
You don't remember me?

42:14.927 --> 42:17.062
Yeah, you're, um...

42:17.096 --> 42:18.831
- Diane.
- Diane, yes.

42:18.864 --> 42:20.332
Brianna's friend.

42:20.366 --> 42:22.067
Right, I do think
I know a Brianna.

42:22.101 --> 42:24.069
Maybe it's another
URIDE driver

42:24.103 --> 42:26.038
who stalks my friend,
fights her boyfriend,

42:26.071 --> 42:29.475
and then takes her out
for Mexican food.

42:29.508 --> 42:32.378
Oh, yeah, that Brianna.

42:32.411 --> 42:34.914
Yeah, except I didn't
fight her boyfriend,

42:34.947 --> 42:36.415
and I definitely don't
stalk her, okay?

42:36.448 --> 42:38.717
She just happens to be
where I drive by.

42:38.751 --> 42:40.252
Oh, you just happened
to drive by

42:40.286 --> 42:42.321
where she lives, works,
and hangs out?

42:42.354 --> 42:44.490
No, it's not even...

42:46.091 --> 42:47.459
Is that what she thinks of me?

42:47.493 --> 42:50.029
Don't worry. I think it's cute.

42:50.062 --> 42:51.964
It's like a romantic comedy.

42:51.997 --> 42:53.232
Girl has abusive boyfriend,

42:53.265 --> 42:56.969
she meets some nice guy
with a humble job

42:57.002 --> 43:00.839
who does crazy things
to get her attention.

43:00.873 --> 43:05.778
I wish someone would do
insane things for me.

43:05.811 --> 43:08.447
I'd settle for Mexican food.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.949
So she doesn't think it's cute.

43:11.550 --> 43:13.152
Selective hearing,
my one weakness.

43:15.254 --> 43:17.823
Um...

43:17.856 --> 43:21.293
How about we go
to Mexican food, too?

43:21.327 --> 43:22.361
Really?

43:29.969 --> 43:33.272
That is a big burrito.

43:33.305 --> 43:35.407
Hey, can I get your number?

43:35.441 --> 43:37.443
Yeah, of course, of course.

43:37.476 --> 43:38.877
'Cause that way
if we want to text

43:38.911 --> 43:41.046
or hang out or whatever,

43:41.080 --> 43:42.281
we don't have to use
the URIDE app.

43:44.516 --> 43:46.252
And for what it's worth,

43:46.285 --> 43:48.921
I hope she chooses
not asshole boyfriend.

43:48.954 --> 43:50.489
And picks me?

43:50.522 --> 43:52.992
I wouldn't go that far.

43:53.025 --> 43:55.294
I mean, faint heart
never won fair lady,

43:55.327 --> 43:58.464
but no one likes a creeper
who won't give you your space.

43:58.497 --> 43:59.832
You're on her radar,
just let her decide

43:59.865 --> 44:00.966
to come to you.

44:12.845 --> 44:15.914
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

44:15.948 --> 44:17.182
I just haven't heard from you,

44:17.216 --> 44:19.051
and I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

44:19.084 --> 44:20.919
Are you crazy?

44:20.953 --> 44:22.554
Me, crazy?

44:22.588 --> 44:24.156
You're the one
that's breaking up with

44:24.189 --> 44:27.092
a homicidal boyfriend,
and I'm the crazy one

44:27.126 --> 44:28.894
for checking to see
if you're okay?

44:28.927 --> 44:32.164
Everything all right?

44:32.197 --> 44:33.999
No, babe, it's fine, um,

44:34.033 --> 44:37.236
somebody just lost their way.

44:37.269 --> 44:39.104
Yeah, see, you are looking for

44:39.138 --> 44:40.839
East Hollyway,

44:40.873 --> 44:43.942
and this is just Hollyway.

44:46.945 --> 44:49.281
You didn't break up with him.

44:49.315 --> 44:52.318
Look, this... this isn't the time
and place for this conversation.

44:52.351 --> 44:54.086
Okay?

44:54.119 --> 44:57.256
We'll talk about it later.

44:57.289 --> 44:58.957
Where?

44:58.991 --> 45:01.093
- When?
- I don't... I don't know.

45:01.126 --> 45:04.363
I'll just... I'll just
summon you, okay?

45:09.068 --> 45:10.369
Did you give him
the right directions?

45:10.402 --> 45:13.372
He'll figure it out.

45:17.209 --> 45:19.211
Um, I'm gonna have
to run by Diane's

45:19.244 --> 45:22.649
- a little bit later.
- Yeah, of course.

45:22.682 --> 45:24.383
Whatever you want.

45:28.454 --> 45:32.024
Hey, did you work out
new levels to the game?

45:32.057 --> 45:33.459
No, we just had
to change the look

45:33.492 --> 45:35.027
of all the old stuff,

45:35.060 --> 45:37.296
since we couldn't
secure the license.

45:37.329 --> 45:40.165
Oh, that sucks.

45:40.199 --> 45:42.534
But, I have new art.

45:42.568 --> 45:45.003
Hm, can I see it?

45:45.037 --> 45:46.939
Yeah.

45:54.079 --> 45:56.014
That must be the pizza man.

45:56.048 --> 45:58.250
Or maybe it's your lost traveler

45:58.283 --> 46:00.486
who didn't understand
your directions.

46:00.519 --> 46:03.589
This is my place
and my area, okay?

46:03.622 --> 46:06.458
- I'll take care of it.
- Or maybe we should both get it.

46:06.492 --> 46:09.194
Babe, just sit down, relax,

46:09.228 --> 46:10.663
play the game.

46:10.697 --> 46:12.632
I need to know
what you think of it.

46:15.635 --> 46:18.270
Yeah, I couldn't find it.

46:18.303 --> 46:20.506
I couldn't find the phone,
but you know what I did find?

46:20.539 --> 46:23.710
That my balls have abilities
kinda like a fly trap.

46:23.743 --> 46:25.712
Um, it's gonna be, uh,

46:25.745 --> 46:27.379
$13.52.

46:27.413 --> 46:29.281
Okay, let's see.

46:29.314 --> 46:31.450
Gettin' chilly out there.

46:37.156 --> 46:40.159
- Go ahead and keep the change.
- Oh, thanks.

46:40.192 --> 46:43.195
- Enjoy your pizza.
- Thanks, have a good night.

46:52.504 --> 46:54.973
So, what do you think?

46:55.007 --> 46:56.575
I love it.

46:56.608 --> 46:58.577
I didn't get the original.

46:58.610 --> 47:01.714
This one's a lot easier
for me to follow.

47:42.822 --> 47:45.792
Hey, it's the nugget.

47:45.825 --> 47:47.660
- What are you doing here?
- Your mom and I

47:47.694 --> 47:50.262
are getting back together, boy.

47:50.295 --> 47:51.731
For now.

47:51.764 --> 47:53.766
We're back together for now.

47:53.800 --> 47:57.069
It's a Christmas
fucking miracle.

47:57.102 --> 47:59.438
Can I talk to you for a second?

48:04.476 --> 48:06.646
Hey, hey, I thought we were
gonna take care of things.

48:06.679 --> 48:10.182
Mhm, and how well
is that working out?

48:10.215 --> 48:12.217
You know, I checked
the mileage on the Prius.

48:12.251 --> 48:13.820
It's out there just
sitting there all night lately.

48:13.853 --> 48:15.621
I am trying, Mom.

48:15.655 --> 48:17.289
All right,
don't you think I'm trying?

48:17.322 --> 48:18.725
Just think you're
killing yourself

48:18.758 --> 48:20.827
for not very much money.

48:20.860 --> 48:23.262
Eric said he'll change.

48:23.295 --> 48:25.330
He's not gonna change.

48:25.364 --> 48:27.634
All right? It takes a lot
for somebody to change,

48:27.667 --> 48:29.601
and he's not the type of person
to put in the effort.

48:29.636 --> 48:31.236
Hell, he's not even
the type of person

48:31.270 --> 48:33.171
that thinks there's
something wrong with him.

48:33.205 --> 48:34.540
It's just until
the lawyers can get me

48:34.573 --> 48:36.208
the worker's comp money.

48:36.241 --> 48:38.510
They know you didn't
hurt yourself at work, Mom.

48:38.544 --> 48:41.179
All right, they're just trying
to find a way to prove it.

48:41.213 --> 48:43.248
I hurt it at work.

48:43.282 --> 48:46.385
Yeah, then why aren't you
wearing the sling?

48:46.418 --> 48:47.787
'Cause he did this.

48:47.820 --> 48:51.758
If you have a problem
with a man, boy,

48:51.791 --> 48:54.159
you bring it up to his face.

48:54.192 --> 48:56.261
You don't go hiding
around the corner

48:56.295 --> 48:57.630
and complain to Mommy.

48:57.664 --> 48:59.766
You can't handle
what I have to say to you.

48:59.799 --> 49:02.769
I could handle exactly what
you have to say to me, son.

49:02.802 --> 49:05.772
Enough, both of you.

49:05.805 --> 49:08.407
This is my house.

49:08.440 --> 49:10.342
Things are different this time.

49:12.177 --> 49:13.813
Things are different this time.

49:16.582 --> 49:18.183
You're right, baby.

49:18.216 --> 49:20.452
I'm sorry.

49:24.590 --> 49:27.694
You.

49:27.727 --> 49:30.429
I'm not a fraud.

49:30.462 --> 49:32.899
I'm a good person, Catholic,

49:32.932 --> 49:35.267
and your mother.

49:35.300 --> 49:36.836
You're not God.

49:36.869 --> 49:40.606
- Don't judge me.
- Okay, look, I'm sorry.

49:40.640 --> 49:44.343
All right? I just think things
are better when he's gone.

49:44.376 --> 49:46.646
This house
was my father's house,

49:46.679 --> 49:48.213
and after the doctors' bills,

49:48.246 --> 49:49.716
it was all he had to give me.

49:49.749 --> 49:52.417
I am not losing it
so you can play big man.

49:54.186 --> 49:56.221
Take the gift.

49:56.254 --> 49:57.657
Go back to college.

49:57.690 --> 49:59.424
I can't go back to college,
I already dropped

49:59.458 --> 50:02.227
- all my classes...
- Then go back next semester.

50:02.260 --> 50:03.696
Become someone
who can take care of us,

50:03.730 --> 50:07.466
then you can decide
what happens in this house.

50:07.499 --> 50:10.903
I'm not having my son
drive an underpaid taxi

50:10.937 --> 50:14.206
and pretend he has a future.

50:45.570 --> 50:48.407
I hear this is a great place to
think through tough decisions.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.643
Yeah, are you okay?

50:50.677 --> 50:53.311
You're a really nice guy, Jesus.

50:53.345 --> 50:55.380
Oh, God.

50:55.414 --> 50:58.651
And Diane has taken
a liking to you,

50:58.685 --> 51:02.421
and I think you guys would be
really great for each other.

51:02.454 --> 51:04.857
- I don't want Diane.
- Well, I don't want you.

51:07.559 --> 51:10.228
I thought we had a connection.

51:12.732 --> 51:15.567
I mean, if you can honestly say
that you didn't feel anything,

51:15.600 --> 51:17.970
then I'll leave right now.

51:18.004 --> 51:21.406
I love Kaiden, okay?

51:21.440 --> 51:23.976
That's not love,
it's Stockholm syndrome.

51:24.010 --> 51:26.478
Love is serious for me.

51:26.511 --> 51:28.280
It's not just something
I'm gonna throw away

51:28.313 --> 51:31.583
because some cute guy
happens to come along

51:31.616 --> 51:32.919
with a little bit less damage.

51:32.952 --> 51:35.454
Kaiden's not damaged,
he's wrecked!

51:35.487 --> 51:37.890
Well, you know what?
Maybe I am, too, then.

51:37.924 --> 51:40.625
And what about your kids?

51:40.660 --> 51:42.294
What are they gonna do, huh,
when he gets out of control?

51:42.327 --> 51:44.764
Well, you know what?
That's not your problem.

51:44.797 --> 51:46.398
You can't control him.

51:46.431 --> 51:48.901
I'm sorry, Jesus,

51:48.935 --> 51:51.336
but I've made my decision.

51:53.706 --> 51:56.608
- You still want a ride?
- Sure.

52:07.552 --> 52:09.722
What are you doing here?

52:09.756 --> 52:11.456
I'm here to see Brianna.

52:11.490 --> 52:13.760
We're hanging out.

52:13.793 --> 52:15.560
You can talk to her later.

52:15.594 --> 52:18.631
- Are you sure?
- Just leave.

52:18.664 --> 52:19.966
Okay.

52:19.999 --> 52:22.635
Well, you fucked up,
you know that right?

52:22.668 --> 52:24.971
I didn't come here
to see if she was here.

52:25.004 --> 52:27.472
Came here to see
if you'd lie for her,

52:27.506 --> 52:29.374
and since you did
means she's doing something

52:29.407 --> 52:30.843
she's not supposed to,

52:30.877 --> 52:32.511
probably with
that URIDE driver.

52:32.544 --> 52:34.613
I don't know what she's doing,
but I lied to you

52:34.647 --> 52:36.015
because you're an abusive prick

52:36.048 --> 52:37.950
who doesn't deserve
to be with Brianna.

52:37.984 --> 52:40.385
Oh, please.

52:40.418 --> 52:42.320
You just hate me
'cause you're in love with her,

52:42.354 --> 52:44.589
- and she's not.
- Fuck you.

52:44.623 --> 52:47.026
And if I were abusive,
she would've left me.

52:47.059 --> 52:49.427
- Get out before I call the cops.
- The cops?

52:49.461 --> 52:52.397
- Mhm.
- Go ahead.

52:52.430 --> 52:54.332
Didn't think so.

53:10.917 --> 53:13.753
I just... I just don't understand

53:13.786 --> 53:16.454
why I've lost everything.

53:16.488 --> 53:18.791
All right? My mom kicked
my dad out for abusing her.

53:18.825 --> 53:21.093
All right, her work knows

53:21.127 --> 53:23.062
that she's committing fraud
and they cut off her checks,

53:23.095 --> 53:24.997
and then I had to move back home
or else the bills

53:25.031 --> 53:28.600
- wouldn't get paid.
- Look, that all really sucks,

53:28.634 --> 53:30.636
okay, I get it, and...

53:30.670 --> 53:32.972
and you're a great guy for
coming back to help your mom.

53:33.005 --> 53:34.941
So, then why are you picking
that asshole instead of me?

53:34.974 --> 53:36.943
Oh, God, this fucking cliché.

53:36.976 --> 53:40.012
Not every guy that I meet
is just automatically

53:40.046 --> 53:42.581
thrown into some competition
with the guy

53:42.614 --> 53:44.784
that I've been dating
for the past four years.

53:44.817 --> 53:47.385
Okay, somebody that I said,
"I love you" to.

53:47.419 --> 53:49.487
That's a real promise.

53:49.521 --> 53:52.058
Yeah, but Jesus fucking Christ,
it's not a wedding vow.

53:52.091 --> 53:55.895
Well, you know what?
For me it basically is, okay?

53:55.928 --> 53:58.164
I know that my relationship
is broken right now,

53:58.197 --> 54:01.399
but I am trying to fix it.

54:01.433 --> 54:03.468
I'm not just gonna
throw away all those years.

54:03.501 --> 54:06.138
That time has to mean something.

54:06.172 --> 54:08.506
You're just gonna give
more of your life to misery

54:08.540 --> 54:11.509
by trying to fix the unfixable.

54:11.543 --> 54:14.479
All right? The only way
to deal with abusive men

54:14.512 --> 54:15.982
is to kick them
out of your life,

54:16.015 --> 54:17.650
- and you know how I know...
- Well, I'm sorry that you

54:17.683 --> 54:19.118
didn't love your dad enough
to try and help him.

54:19.151 --> 54:20.987
- Fucking Christ...
- You are really making me

54:21.020 --> 54:23.723
wanna leave my boyfriend
for you right now.

54:23.756 --> 54:26.659
Look, you said you were unhappy,

54:26.692 --> 54:29.028
and it's only gonna get worse.

54:34.734 --> 54:37.870
You said,
"Make this time matter."

54:37.904 --> 54:40.538
Well, I've spent
the last few months

54:40.572 --> 54:42.909
of my life

54:42.942 --> 54:44.509
trying to free
my mom from my dad,

54:44.542 --> 54:46.611
and now he's back.

54:46.646 --> 54:49.916
All right? So everything that
I sacrificed was for nothing.

54:53.252 --> 54:54.720
Except I got to meet you.

54:54.754 --> 54:56.756
Ugh, no.

54:56.789 --> 55:00.625
- No, Jesus.
- Look, the only way

55:00.660 --> 55:02.161
that this time
is gonna be meaningful

55:02.194 --> 55:04.864
is if we hook up together.

55:04.897 --> 55:07.166
- What?
- I mean,

55:07.199 --> 55:09.902
think about it, it...
it's our destiny,

55:09.936 --> 55:12.638
- it's our fate, it's...
- Look, I am sorry

55:12.672 --> 55:16.508
that you did a noble deed
for no reward,

55:16.541 --> 55:19.011
but as the random woman
whom you barely know

55:19.045 --> 55:21.479
and happen to have feelings for,

55:21.513 --> 55:24.582
I am not obligated
to compensate you

55:24.616 --> 55:27.053
on behalf of
the fucking universe, okay?

55:34.160 --> 55:37.163
No.

55:37.196 --> 55:39.899
Fuck this, I just...
this whole fucking thing.

55:45.104 --> 55:47.073
What are you doing?
I don't live this way.

55:47.106 --> 55:48.606
Fuck, nothing's
coming out right, okay,

55:48.641 --> 55:50.276
- just give me a minute.
- No, no, no.

55:50.309 --> 55:53.145
- Take me home now.
- No, no, no, I'll take you home

55:53.179 --> 55:55.881
as soon as I can prove to you
why you're making a mistake

55:55.915 --> 55:58.718
- staying with Kaiden.
- Let me out or I'm getting out.

55:58.751 --> 56:00.252
Can you honestly say
that you feel safer

56:00.286 --> 56:02.620
jumping out right here
than just staying in this car

56:02.655 --> 56:04.991
and talking with me?

56:06.192 --> 56:09.729
Help! Help!

56:09.762 --> 56:11.297
- Help!
- Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

56:11.330 --> 56:14.100
- Calm down.
- I'm calling 911.

56:14.133 --> 56:15.668
This is kidnapping.

56:21.606 --> 56:23.075
911.

56:25.678 --> 56:27.279
You asshole!

56:27.313 --> 56:29.148
Oh, crap!

56:29.181 --> 56:32.818
No, no, I... I'm not going

56:32.852 --> 56:34.552
anywhere with you, okay?

56:34.586 --> 56:36.255
You are gonna have to stop
at a light eventually,

56:36.288 --> 56:39.692
and I am getting
the fuck out of this car.

56:39.725 --> 56:41.327
If you want me
to run all these lights,

56:41.360 --> 56:43.829
I will.

56:43.863 --> 56:46.265
You win, I'll just be your

56:46.298 --> 56:49.035
- good little captive.
- You're not a captive!

57:01.080 --> 57:02.982
Any available units
near District 14,

57:03.015 --> 57:06.919
be advised of a dropped call
near 27-53 Big Leaf Parkway.

57:06.952 --> 57:09.221
Hey, that's not far from here.

57:09.255 --> 57:12.291
- You wanna check it out?
- Why not?

57:12.324 --> 57:14.727
Uh, it's Detective Nwafor,

57:14.760 --> 57:16.028
20's close to the location.

57:16.062 --> 57:17.863
We can check that out
for you guys.

57:17.897 --> 57:20.833
10-4, Nwafor.

57:20.866 --> 57:23.002
Pop the lights, let's go.

57:51.197 --> 57:53.232
The number you have called
is not available.

57:53.265 --> 57:55.935
Please leave a message
for... Jesus.

57:55.968 --> 57:57.803
Hey, Jesus, it's Diane.

57:57.837 --> 57:59.405
Brianna isn't answering.

57:59.438 --> 58:00.940
Kaiden just came to my place

58:00.973 --> 58:04.276
with his
hyper-masculine bullshit,

58:04.310 --> 58:06.245
looking for Brianna.

58:06.278 --> 58:08.013
He says he's been
tracking her phone.

58:08.047 --> 58:09.415
He suspects you're together.

58:09.448 --> 58:12.017
Look, you cannot...

58:12.051 --> 58:14.353
you cannot be found together.

58:14.386 --> 58:16.222
I don't know,
I have this feeling

58:16.255 --> 58:17.323
that something bad's
gonna happen to Brianna,

58:17.356 --> 58:18.958
you know?

58:18.991 --> 58:20.926
I don't know,
I guess I'm saying,

58:20.960 --> 58:23.095
look out for my friend, okay?

58:40.446 --> 58:42.081
So,

58:42.114 --> 58:43.949
what are you gonna do to me?

58:46.051 --> 58:48.387
We're just gonna talk.

58:48.420 --> 58:50.923
Look, I know what
I did earlier was crazy,

58:50.956 --> 58:53.959
but we're gonna laugh about it
when we're done.

58:53.993 --> 58:56.395
Okay?

59:01.367 --> 59:03.102
Bitch!

59:11.443 --> 59:13.279
Why won't you let me save you?

59:14.847 --> 59:16.782
Look at me!

59:21.020 --> 59:24.423
Jesus, look at
the situation, okay?

59:24.456 --> 59:25.958
What makes you think
that you're the knight

59:25.991 --> 59:28.794
and not the fucking dragon?

59:28.827 --> 59:31.964
Kaiden is dangerous.

59:31.997 --> 59:34.300
You think that you can save me

59:34.333 --> 59:36.936
from my boyfriend by beating me

59:36.969 --> 59:39.305
with a fucking lead pipe?

59:42.074 --> 59:45.411
Go on, hit me then, daddy's boy.

59:45.444 --> 59:48.214
Give in to your
fucking feelings.

1:00:04.863 --> 1:00:06.765
And did you see
how I took control

1:00:06.799 --> 1:00:08.367
of that situation?

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:10.336
Half your size, no weapon,

1:00:10.369 --> 1:00:13.472
and yet you're the one
who got hurt.

1:00:13.505 --> 1:00:15.975
I don't need saving.

1:00:16.008 --> 1:00:18.978
- Please don't do this.
- You are going to jail.

1:00:19.011 --> 1:00:22.181
You don't treat women that way.

1:00:22.214 --> 1:00:25.117
Not only could you not
save your mom,

1:00:25.150 --> 1:00:26.218
but when she finds out
that you're on

1:00:26.252 --> 1:00:29.255
the sexual predator list,

1:00:29.288 --> 1:00:32.258
it's probably gonna kill her.

1:00:40.065 --> 1:00:41.900
Oh, shit.

1:00:47.606 --> 1:00:49.875
Oh, shit!

1:01:04.990 --> 1:01:07.893
She's fine, everything's fine,
we're fine.

1:01:07.926 --> 1:01:10.863
That was a nice swing, slugger.

1:01:10.896 --> 1:01:12.531
What are you doing here?

1:01:12.564 --> 1:01:16.502
Well, your mom sent me outside
to see what all the noise was.

1:01:16.535 --> 1:01:18.404
We're lucky she didn't
come out herself.

1:01:21.073 --> 1:01:22.474
No usable fingerprints
even though

1:01:22.508 --> 1:01:25.311
he was just touching it.

1:01:25.344 --> 1:01:26.945
I wonder how that happened.

1:01:26.979 --> 1:01:28.480
That's my girlfriend's phone.

1:01:28.514 --> 1:01:30.582
We're wasting time,
she's in danger.

1:01:30.616 --> 1:01:32.418
We have people looking for her.

1:01:32.451 --> 1:01:34.253
But how did you know
the phone was here?

1:01:34.286 --> 1:01:36.588
I had a tracker installed.

1:01:36.622 --> 1:01:38.324
Did you install it
with her consent?

1:01:38.357 --> 1:01:40.626
Yeah, and she'll tell you that.

1:01:40.660 --> 1:01:42.995
But do you have consent
to search her phone?

1:01:43.028 --> 1:01:44.563
An unlocked phone
is an open phone.

1:01:44.596 --> 1:01:47.099
- That doesn't seem legal.
- Sir, do you have a problem

1:01:47.132 --> 1:01:49.501
with us finding your girlfriend?

1:01:49.535 --> 1:01:51.236
No.

1:01:51.270 --> 1:01:53.405
Why did she have
a tracker on her phone?

1:01:53.439 --> 1:01:56.041
Was she concerned something
like this might happen?

1:01:56.075 --> 1:01:57.644
Yeah, there was
this creepy URIDE driver

1:01:57.677 --> 1:02:00.612
who's been harassing her
the past several days.

1:02:00.647 --> 1:02:03.415
We installed it for safety.

1:02:03.449 --> 1:02:07.152
- I don't see a tracking app.
- It's hidden.

1:02:07.186 --> 1:02:09.888
Look, she makes video games.

1:02:09.922 --> 1:02:11.390
She didn't want anyone
at the office thinking

1:02:11.423 --> 1:02:13.192
something weird was going on.

1:02:13.225 --> 1:02:15.027
You said it was a URIDE driver?

1:02:15.060 --> 1:02:16.395
Yes, ma'am.

1:02:18.997 --> 1:02:22.134
- Is this him?
- Yes.

1:02:22.167 --> 1:02:24.637
You find him, you find Brianna.

1:02:41.019 --> 1:02:43.455
Oh, that is good,
throw that rag on the ground

1:02:43.489 --> 1:02:45.991
and spread the DNA everywhere.

1:02:46.024 --> 1:02:47.626
Are you gonna help me or not?

1:02:47.660 --> 1:02:50.095
- Now you want my help.
- What do you want?

1:02:51.964 --> 1:02:53.966
A simple exchange.

1:02:53.999 --> 1:02:57.069
You don't ruin my life,
and I won't ruin yours.

1:02:59.605 --> 1:03:02.341
Stop trying to get me
kicked out of the house.

1:03:02.374 --> 1:03:05.310
Let your mom's crooked lawyers
bleed her workman's comp dry,

1:03:05.344 --> 1:03:07.079
and above all else,
stop telling her

1:03:07.112 --> 1:03:10.048
that there's a world outside
that she could survive in

1:03:10.082 --> 1:03:13.218
without me.

1:03:13.252 --> 1:03:16.155
I'm not selling you my mom.

1:03:16.188 --> 1:03:17.657
Fuck that.

1:03:17.690 --> 1:03:20.660
It's more like
you're leasing her to me,

1:03:20.693 --> 1:03:22.494
and you did just club a girl
in the head with a pipe.

1:03:22.528 --> 1:03:25.264
I wouldn't exactly say
you're a third wave feminist.

1:03:25.297 --> 1:03:27.332
So, what's it gonna be?

1:03:27.366 --> 1:03:29.334
Are you gonna get to live life
like a man who's never kidnapped

1:03:29.368 --> 1:03:31.103
and murdered a woman?

1:03:31.136 --> 1:03:34.406
- I didn't murder her.
- You're gonna have to.

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:37.509
If you catch a tiger by the toe,

1:03:37.543 --> 1:03:39.646
there's no letting it go.

1:03:39.679 --> 1:03:41.748
Just stop talking, Dad.

1:03:41.781 --> 1:03:43.683
Every single family has a curse.

1:03:43.716 --> 1:03:46.452
This violence and rage,

1:03:46.485 --> 1:03:48.620
that's ours.

1:03:48.655 --> 1:03:50.522
Justice,

1:03:50.556 --> 1:03:53.425
fairness, goodness.

1:03:53.459 --> 1:03:57.162
Those are all
social constructs, man.

1:03:57.196 --> 1:03:59.097
Selfishness
is the way of nature.

1:04:01.533 --> 1:04:04.303
I'm still a good person.

1:04:07.272 --> 1:04:09.208
No, you're not,

1:04:09.241 --> 1:04:11.076
and neither am I.

1:04:11.109 --> 1:04:13.312
Bro, all you have is your life.

1:04:13.345 --> 1:04:16.315
Are you gonna let this girl
put your entire universe

1:04:16.348 --> 1:04:20.052
behind a prison cell
for the rest of your existence?

1:04:23.188 --> 1:04:25.123
He's lying.

1:04:25.157 --> 1:04:27.493
This girl regularly used
this Jesus driver.

1:04:27.526 --> 1:04:29.528
She liked him or at least
felt safe with him.

1:04:29.561 --> 1:04:32.064
The stalker story
doesn't pan out.

1:04:32.097 --> 1:04:33.700
Doesn't that white Camaro
match the description

1:04:33.733 --> 1:04:35.300
of the vehicle
from the road rage incident

1:04:35.334 --> 1:04:38.070
a few days ago?

1:04:38.103 --> 1:04:41.507
The victim's car was
a dark Toyota Prius, right?

1:04:41.540 --> 1:04:43.810
Yeah, why?

1:04:43.843 --> 1:04:46.378
So, am I under arrest
or can I go?

1:04:46.411 --> 1:04:49.348
Should you be under arrest...

1:04:49.381 --> 1:04:50.750
Kaiden?

1:04:50.783 --> 1:04:52.417
It's all circumstantial,
we don't have enough

1:04:52.451 --> 1:04:55.153
to keep him.

1:04:55.187 --> 1:04:57.824
One part of the story
does hold up.

1:04:57.857 --> 1:05:01.159
The URIDE driver was one of
the last people to see Brianna.

1:05:01.193 --> 1:05:03.730
You're free to go.

1:05:03.763 --> 1:05:05.531
But don't leave town.

1:05:10.737 --> 1:05:12.271
What are you doing?

1:05:12.304 --> 1:05:14.106
You need to leave some water
in the barrel.

1:05:14.139 --> 1:05:16.241
- For what?
- To drown this puppy

1:05:16.275 --> 1:05:18.076
like the bitch that she is.

1:05:18.110 --> 1:05:20.579
- I'm not killing her.
- Fine.

1:05:20.612 --> 1:05:22.281
- I'll do it.
- No!

1:05:22.314 --> 1:05:24.583
If you leave a girl alive
long enough in a barrel,

1:05:24.616 --> 1:05:26.518
the first thing she's gonna do
when she wakes up

1:05:26.552 --> 1:05:28.387
is scream like a banshee.

1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:29.822
I'm not drowning her.

1:05:41.734 --> 1:05:43.870
Incoming call from Jesus.

1:05:45.738 --> 1:05:47.606
- Diane.
- I've been calling and texting.

1:05:47.640 --> 1:05:49.241
I got your voicemail,
have you talked to Brianna?

1:05:49.274 --> 1:05:51.209
Is she with you, what happened?

1:05:51.243 --> 1:05:53.412
She called me to pick her up
from the spot that I showed her.

1:05:53.445 --> 1:05:56.548
- She said she wanted to talk.
- What did she wanna talk about?

1:05:56.582 --> 1:05:59.652
Um... she said
she wanted to leave Kaiden,

1:05:59.686 --> 1:06:01.721
and that he made her
fear for his life.

1:06:01.754 --> 1:06:04.122
- Then what happened?
- And then, he showed up.

1:06:04.156 --> 1:06:06.224
- Oh, God, are you okay?
- I don't know how he found us

1:06:06.258 --> 1:06:08.327
until I got your voicemail.

1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:10.697
He said that I was
sleeping with her,

1:06:10.730 --> 1:06:13.165
and that he wanted to kill her
for being a whore.

1:06:13.198 --> 1:06:14.634
Well, that sounds like Kaiden.

1:06:14.667 --> 1:06:17.737
And then, I told him to get back
in his little pony car

1:06:17.770 --> 1:06:20.472
and get out of here.

1:06:20.505 --> 1:06:22.174
He just let her go?

1:06:26.311 --> 1:06:28.848
- Jesus, are you there?
- Somebody's here.

1:06:28.881 --> 1:06:30.482
If it's the cops,
send them to my place.

1:06:30.515 --> 1:06:32.150
If he did anything to her,
I wanna be the one

1:06:32.184 --> 1:06:33.585
- to make him pay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotta go.

1:06:33.619 --> 1:06:35.387
I gotta go, I gotta go.

1:06:50.469 --> 1:06:51.938
Hi, Jesus?

1:06:51.971 --> 1:06:54.373
- Yes?
- I'm Detective Clarkson.

1:06:54.406 --> 1:06:56.809
This is my partner,
Detective Nwafor.

1:06:56.843 --> 1:06:58.945
Do you mind if we ask you
some questions?

1:06:58.978 --> 1:07:00.680
- Sure.
- Do you work

1:07:00.713 --> 1:07:02.749
as a URIDE driver?

1:07:02.782 --> 1:07:04.349
Yes.

1:07:04.383 --> 1:07:06.853
Did anything interesting
happen to you tonight?

1:07:08.587 --> 1:07:10.255
What do you mean?

1:07:10.288 --> 1:07:12.424
For instance,
where'd you get that black eye?

1:07:12.457 --> 1:07:14.593
Yeah, that's a mean shiner.

1:07:14.626 --> 1:07:16.561
A passenger's boyfriend hit me.

1:07:16.595 --> 1:07:18.563
And why would he do that?

1:07:18.597 --> 1:07:21.433
Because he's a psychopath.

1:07:21.466 --> 1:07:23.602
I'm sorry, it's getting
a little cold out here.

1:07:23.636 --> 1:07:27.472
Do you mind if we
continue this inside?

1:07:27.506 --> 1:07:30.375
Yeah, come on in.

1:07:34.814 --> 1:07:36.281
You got a bathroom?

1:07:38.350 --> 1:07:40.385
Sit down, son.

1:07:40.419 --> 1:07:42.220
Nice place you got here.

1:07:42.254 --> 1:07:43.790
You live with your mom and dad?

1:07:43.823 --> 1:07:46.458
I live here with my mom.

1:07:46.491 --> 1:07:48.861
You know,
we can all save people,

1:07:48.895 --> 1:07:51.964
whether it's a missing person
or someone.

1:07:51.998 --> 1:07:53.598
We just need someone
heroic enough

1:07:53.633 --> 1:07:55.500
to tell us what they know.

1:07:58.805 --> 1:08:00.472
I know certain people
might feel threatened,

1:08:00.505 --> 1:08:03.843
but you can talk to me.

1:08:03.876 --> 1:08:06.913
So, come on, there must be
something you can tell me.

1:08:12.384 --> 1:08:14.721
Okay.

1:08:14.754 --> 1:08:17.023
If it'll help Brianna.

1:08:17.056 --> 1:08:20.258
She snuck out to a spot
that we'd been to before.

1:08:20.292 --> 1:08:21.761
She said that
she wanted to be with me,

1:08:21.794 --> 1:08:23.896
but she was afraid of
what her boyfriend might do.

1:08:25.765 --> 1:08:28.366
I told her I understood.

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:29.969
He'd threatened me before,
told me that

1:08:30.002 --> 1:08:32.471
if I came around there again,
he'd kill me.

1:08:34.674 --> 1:08:36.508
He stepped out, screaming,
"Slut, whore, bitch,

1:08:36.541 --> 1:08:37.744
I'll kill you!"

1:08:39.611 --> 1:08:41.613
Rushed us,
punched me in the jaw.

1:08:41.647 --> 1:08:43.482
I don't know how he found us.

1:08:46.686 --> 1:08:49.856
In the end, she chose
to go with her boyfriend.

1:08:49.889 --> 1:08:52.457
What could I do?
I had to respect her wishes.

1:08:54.861 --> 1:08:58.664
Did you confront him
even though he threatened you?

1:08:58.698 --> 1:09:00.800
Faint heart never won fair lady.

1:09:02.068 --> 1:09:04.871
So, between the threats,
reckless driving,

1:09:04.904 --> 1:09:07.439
and physical assault,
you never thought

1:09:07.472 --> 1:09:10.442
to report any of this
to the police?

1:09:10.475 --> 1:09:12.044
Certain people

1:09:12.078 --> 1:09:14.814
don't like to talk to the cops.

1:09:19.451 --> 1:09:21.386
You wanna check on your partner?
She's been gone a while.

1:09:29.695 --> 1:09:31.396
Sorry about that.

1:09:31.429 --> 1:09:33.633
- I'm here.
- Did you hear any of that?

1:09:33.666 --> 1:09:36.803
Ah, I overheard bits
after "fair lady."

1:09:36.836 --> 1:09:39.337
Where did this woman live?

1:09:39.371 --> 1:09:41.439
Around Hollyway.

1:09:41.473 --> 1:09:43.709
Where the road rage incidents
have been.

1:09:43.743 --> 1:09:45.577
And he ran you off the road?

1:09:47.079 --> 1:09:49.816
Do you mind if we take
a look at your car?

1:10:27.954 --> 1:10:29.789
Good evening, officers.

1:10:29.822 --> 1:10:31.456
What did my son do?

1:10:31.489 --> 1:10:33.125
Nothing, as far as I can tell.

1:10:37.196 --> 1:10:39.899
You said
he ran you off the road?

1:10:39.932 --> 1:10:41.634
Yes.

1:10:43.035 --> 1:10:45.503
There's no mud or dirt.

1:10:45.537 --> 1:10:47.940
Well, he didn't literally
run me off the road.

1:10:47.974 --> 1:10:50.408
It's just a figure of speech.

1:10:50.442 --> 1:10:52.044
Just stopped his car
in front of me.

1:10:52.078 --> 1:10:54.947
- Okay.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1:10:54.981 --> 1:10:56.749
Okay means okay.

1:10:56.782 --> 1:10:58.150
Don't mind Sherlock.

1:10:58.184 --> 1:11:00.720
You're not under suspicion
at the moment.

1:11:13.699 --> 1:11:16.568
What's in the back of the car?

1:11:16.601 --> 1:11:18.638
It's a barrel.

1:11:18.671 --> 1:11:20.740
I work in a warehouse,

1:11:20.773 --> 1:11:23.142
all right, and URIDE's
just my side job.

1:11:23.175 --> 1:11:25.845
I mean, they use me
as a gopher sometimes.

1:11:25.878 --> 1:11:27.579
We are looking for
a missing young woman,

1:11:27.612 --> 1:11:29.148
and you happen to have
a young-woman-sized container

1:11:29.181 --> 1:11:31.516
- in the back of your car.
- Okay.

1:11:31.549 --> 1:11:34.220
Okay, you guys
can't come in here

1:11:34.253 --> 1:11:36.222
without a warrant
and start throwing accusations

1:11:36.255 --> 1:11:38.556
at my son, especially
when he has done nothing

1:11:38.590 --> 1:11:41.894
but cooperate with both of you...
in fact, Jesus,

1:11:41.928 --> 1:11:43.863
don't answer any more
of their questions.

1:11:43.896 --> 1:11:46.732
If you're concerned
with warrants,

1:11:46.766 --> 1:11:48.901
we can get you a warrant.

1:11:48.935 --> 1:11:50.169
Get a warrant.

1:11:50.202 --> 1:11:51.938
If you're not
the owner of the car,

1:11:51.971 --> 1:11:55.507
then you do not have a say in
whether or not we can search it.

1:11:55.540 --> 1:11:58.110
Jesus.

1:11:58.144 --> 1:11:59.679
Can we search your car?

1:12:02.148 --> 1:12:04.482
I'm not gonna fight it.

1:12:18.030 --> 1:12:21.033
- It's heavy.
- Did you not drain the water?

1:12:21.067 --> 1:12:23.970
So we can drown this puppy
like the bitch that she is.

1:12:33.079 --> 1:12:35.181
Um...

1:12:35.214 --> 1:12:36.983
- I'm sorry to bother you folks.
- Let us know

1:12:37.016 --> 1:12:39.819
- if there's anything else.
- Well, her friend Diane

1:12:39.852 --> 1:12:42.121
said that she was confronted
by her boyfriend as well.

1:12:44.156 --> 1:12:46.058
I can give you her address.

1:12:46.092 --> 1:12:47.592
- Okay.
- Also, I had to show

1:12:47.625 --> 1:12:50.696
Brianna something
in the URIDE app,

1:12:50.730 --> 1:12:52.798
so I had to touch her phone
to do it.

1:12:52.832 --> 1:12:54.166
Wanna give us that number?

1:13:25.798 --> 1:13:27.833
What the fuck did you do to her?

1:13:27.867 --> 1:13:29.235
Did you fucking kill her?

1:13:29.268 --> 1:13:31.804
Absolutely not.

1:13:31.837 --> 1:13:34.106
And shut the fuck up,
the whole goddamn neighborhood's

1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:36.142
gonna hear you.

1:13:36.175 --> 1:13:38.044
I would've killed her,
but you decided

1:13:38.077 --> 1:13:39.577
to let the police in
without even asking for

1:13:39.611 --> 1:13:42.782
- a fucking warrant...
- Hey, fuck you!

1:13:42.815 --> 1:13:45.151
All right.

1:13:45.184 --> 1:13:48.054
I'm done, I just saved you
from the electrical chair,

1:13:48.087 --> 1:13:50.322
and you wanna still act
like you're better than me.

1:13:54.860 --> 1:13:57.063
Do it yourself.

1:15:18.911 --> 1:15:20.913
Woo! God, it's cold.

1:15:20.946 --> 1:15:22.114
I'm telling you,
Kaiden had "guilty"

1:15:22.148 --> 1:15:24.216
written all over his face.

1:15:24.250 --> 1:15:25.784
I don't think he's
as innocent as he says,

1:15:25.818 --> 1:15:29.855
but his pleas for us to help him
seemed real.

1:15:29.889 --> 1:15:31.257
You know you don't have shit.

1:15:31.290 --> 1:15:32.925
Look.

1:15:32.958 --> 1:15:36.228
A bad, thinly veiled story
about a love triangle.

1:15:36.262 --> 1:15:38.330
The woman rejects the hero,
and doesn't even seem

1:15:38.364 --> 1:15:40.232
like he realizes it.

1:15:40.266 --> 1:15:42.868
When we were leaving,
Jesus offered us an alibi

1:15:42.902 --> 1:15:44.436
for his fingerprints, like...

1:15:44.470 --> 1:15:46.405
Yeah, fingerprints
that weren't even there,

1:15:46.438 --> 1:15:48.140
'cause Kaiden kidnapped Brianna,

1:15:48.174 --> 1:15:49.441
then he went back
and messed with the evidence,

1:15:49.475 --> 1:15:51.877
AKA the phone.

1:15:51.911 --> 1:15:53.345
You got hoof prints,
try looking for horses

1:15:53.379 --> 1:15:55.447
before unicorns.

1:15:57.483 --> 1:15:58.984
Help!

1:15:59.018 --> 1:16:00.920
Can anyone hear me?

1:16:00.953 --> 1:16:03.289
Help me!

1:16:13.899 --> 1:16:15.434
Somebody help!

1:16:15.467 --> 1:16:18.070
Help me!

1:16:18.103 --> 1:16:19.772
Let me out!

1:16:19.805 --> 1:16:22.041
You fucking freak!

1:16:22.074 --> 1:16:23.442
Help.

1:16:23.475 --> 1:16:25.177
Let me out!

1:16:45.097 --> 1:16:47.066
Help, can anyone hear me?

1:16:47.099 --> 1:16:49.835
Calm down, Brianna,
just calm down.

1:16:49.868 --> 1:16:51.103
- Please.
- Let me out!

1:17:24.103 --> 1:17:27.439
Can anyone hear me?

1:17:27.473 --> 1:17:29.275
Help.

1:17:29.308 --> 1:17:31.443
Help, help me!

1:17:33.612 --> 1:17:35.314
It's over, asshole.

1:17:35.347 --> 1:17:37.116
Where's Brianna?

1:17:43.589 --> 1:17:45.291
Kaiden.

1:17:45.324 --> 1:17:47.192
- I'm in here.
- Hold on.

1:18:06.011 --> 1:18:07.946
Kaiden, Kaiden!

1:18:14.987 --> 1:18:17.623
Jesus.

1:18:17.657 --> 1:18:19.491
I... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:18:19.525 --> 1:18:21.193
No!

1:19:18.050 --> 1:19:19.618
911, what's your emergency?

1:19:19.652 --> 1:19:21.253
- Hello?
- Yes, this is 911,

1:19:21.286 --> 1:19:23.322
- what's your emergency?
- Hi, yeah, I spoke with

1:19:23.355 --> 1:19:25.357
Detective Clarkson about the man
that was running Priuses

1:19:25.391 --> 1:19:27.192
- off the road.
- Have you come in contact

1:19:27.226 --> 1:19:29.228
with the suspect?

1:19:29.261 --> 1:19:30.663
Yeah, he followed me to my work.

1:19:30.697 --> 1:19:32.364
Where do you work, sir?

1:19:32.398 --> 1:19:35.267
I work at the warehouse
off Temple Street.

1:19:35.300 --> 1:19:36.669
- Is anyone injured?
- Yeah, he...

1:19:36.703 --> 1:19:39.037
he came at me.

1:19:39.071 --> 1:19:42.341
He attacked me,
and I had to defend myself.

1:19:42.374 --> 1:19:44.711
Is the suspect armed?

1:19:44.744 --> 1:19:47.413
- Sir?
- Can you...

1:19:47.446 --> 1:19:49.248
can you just
please get down here?

1:19:49.281 --> 1:19:50.650
I think his girlfriend's
in danger.

1:19:50.683 --> 1:19:52.618
Officers are on their way, sir.

1:20:23.515 --> 1:20:25.117
Where is she?

1:20:25.150 --> 1:20:26.985
It's over, Kaiden,
Brianna's dead.

1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:30.757
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1:20:30.790 --> 1:20:32.558
Yeah, well if you're gonna
do it, you better do it now.

1:20:44.169 --> 1:20:46.673
He's a murderer!

1:20:46.706 --> 1:20:48.240
He fucking killed Brianna
and put her

1:20:48.273 --> 1:20:50.542
- in the fucking trunk!
- You lying bastard!

1:21:11.129 --> 1:21:12.632
- Sir, stay back.
- Miguel,

1:21:12.665 --> 1:21:15.467
- what the hell's going on here?
- Some guy messed up Jesus.

1:21:15.501 --> 1:21:16.803
Oh, man!

1:21:16.836 --> 1:21:19.505
The one day
he shows up early, too.

1:21:19.538 --> 1:21:21.708
You know, this wouldn't
have happened if I was here.

1:21:21.741 --> 1:21:23.542
No one messes with my employees.

1:21:23.575 --> 1:21:25.377
Yeah, except for el jefe.

1:21:29.348 --> 1:21:31.483
Step back.

1:21:45.464 --> 1:21:48.500
Well, got the bad guy.

1:21:48.534 --> 1:21:51.136
You mean we're gonna
book Jesus, too?

1:21:51.169 --> 1:21:54.373
Why in the hell are you
still chasing unicorns?

1:21:54.406 --> 1:21:57.609
All of the evidence points to
an honor-killing-style homicide.

1:21:57.644 --> 1:22:00.647
It's just that Kaiden
trips my lie detector.

1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:04.349
You just have your own bias
against the nice guy thing.

1:22:04.383 --> 1:22:07.219
We'll go back to the station,
review their surveillance tape,

1:22:07.252 --> 1:22:09.321
and we'll show you I'm right.

1:22:09.354 --> 1:22:11.356
I hope so.

1:22:11.390 --> 1:22:13.760
Otherwise, Jesus just used
the law as a weapon.

1:23:11.216 --> 1:23:14.419
The King will answer
and say to them,

1:23:14.453 --> 1:23:15.922
- "To the extent..."
- I really appreciate you coming.

1:23:15.955 --> 1:23:17.790
"...that you did this
for your fellow man,

1:23:17.824 --> 1:23:20.192
- you did it to me."
- I shouldn't be here.

1:23:20.225 --> 1:23:23.195
As long as she had
gone to our church,

1:23:23.228 --> 1:23:26.365
Brianna had cared for
the needs of others,

1:23:26.398 --> 1:23:28.801
taking care of her father,

1:23:28.835 --> 1:23:31.904
who was also
taken from us too soon.

1:23:31.938 --> 1:23:34.373
Though she had lost God,

1:23:34.406 --> 1:23:36.508
she shall find Him
in His kingdom.

1:23:36.541 --> 1:23:38.510
- Amen.
- Amen.

1:23:40.747 --> 1:23:43.548
I'd like to ask
Brianna's friend Diane,

1:23:43.582 --> 1:23:45.752
come please, say a few words.

1:24:02.601 --> 1:24:04.637
I love Brianna.

1:24:06.371 --> 1:24:07.740
I can't bring myself to say it

1:24:07.774 --> 1:24:10.509
in the past tense.

1:24:10.542 --> 1:24:12.411
To know Brianna is to have

1:24:12.444 --> 1:24:14.947
an understanding friend,

1:24:14.981 --> 1:24:16.448
a forgiving friend.

1:24:18.751 --> 1:24:21.688
She saw past people's faults,

1:24:21.721 --> 1:24:25.557
and loved everyone
wholeheartedly.

1:24:25.590 --> 1:24:27.259
I can't give everyone here

1:24:27.292 --> 1:24:30.429
consolation for their grief.

1:24:30.462 --> 1:24:31.998
What I can offer you

1:24:32.031 --> 1:24:34.767
is the certainty of justice.

1:24:37.402 --> 1:24:40.305
The man who did this is gone.

1:24:40.338 --> 1:24:42.240
There's nothing in this tape.

1:24:42.274 --> 1:24:43.575
Fuck.

1:24:43.608 --> 1:24:46.846
He will rot in prison,

1:24:46.879 --> 1:24:48.948
not because we are cruel people,

1:24:48.981 --> 1:24:50.615
but because there is
one basic rule

1:24:50.650 --> 1:24:53.485
to a safe society.

1:24:53.518 --> 1:24:55.520
A civilization

1:24:55.554 --> 1:24:58.024
is where the biggest psychopath
doesn't get to win.

1:24:59.892 --> 1:25:01.861
We are only as safe as long

1:25:01.894 --> 1:25:04.529
as evil deeds have consequences.

1:25:07.566 --> 1:25:09.367
It is our responsibility

1:25:09.401 --> 1:25:11.570
to not play along with evil,

1:25:11.603 --> 1:25:14.473
enable evil, or join evil,

1:25:14.506 --> 1:25:16.776
or let it tempt us
with our desire.

1:25:18.745 --> 1:25:21.047
If we can still pick
what is right for others

1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:22.815
over what we want
for ourselves...

1:25:25.752 --> 1:25:27.419
...then there is still hope.
