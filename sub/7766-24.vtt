00:13.458 --> 00:14.375
- Tonight on "Vanderpump Rules:

00:14.042 --> 00:14.375
Secrets Revealed,"

00:16.208 --> 00:17.958
- Oh, my God.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.042
- Lisa Vanderpump
and the staff of Sur

00:22.042 --> 00:24.458
serve up never-before-seen
moments...

00:24.500 --> 00:25.708
- Like that.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.542
- I'll choke for Lisa anytime.

00:27.542 --> 00:29.792
- Wait, wait, wait, Kristen
hasn't slept with this guy yet?

00:29.833 --> 00:32.042
- And behind-the-scenes
secrets.

00:32.083 --> 00:35.875
- Take a grapefruit in the size
of your man's yumminess.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.042
- So you like stinky feet?
- I like them dirty.

00:38.042 --> 00:39.542
They're in my mouth
right off the bat.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.458
- I do need some makeup.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.958
- Ooh, that's a nice pose.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.875
- I am way too drunk
for my own good.

00:44.875 --> 00:47.375
- White-girl wasted.
- Hey! Hey!

00:47.417 --> 00:48.875
- Weird-ass s*** like this.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.042
Secrets Revealed."

00:56.208 --> 00:58.083
Jax, I was shocked
that you went to Vegas

00:58.125 --> 01:01.917
and didn't impregnate anyone.

01:01.958 --> 01:03.375
You behaved yourself,

01:03.417 --> 01:06.542
and I think you were maybe
the most shocked of all.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.250
- I was.
You know, I***

01:08.250 --> 01:09.917
- Times they are a-changing.
- Yeah.

01:09.917 --> 01:12.167
I guess I'm just getting older,
like,

01:12.208 --> 01:14.333
getting older and starting to
wise up a little bit, I guess.

01:22.625 --> 01:25.667
- Obviously,
we're all good boyfriends,

01:25.708 --> 01:30.125
but there's nothing saying
we can't be social, right?

01:30.125 --> 01:32.708
To being good boys.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.208
- It's okay to look
at the menu.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.625
You just got to know
where to go home to eat.

01:35.625 --> 01:36.917
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:36.958 --> 01:40.583
We set parameters,
so we are allowed to look or no?

01:40.625 --> 01:42.792
- Dude, no.
We can be social. It's fine.

01:42.833 --> 01:44.417
- If we went to a monastery

01:44.458 --> 01:47.708
and behaved, that would--
that would mean nothing.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.958
We're gonna be
putting ourselves to the test.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.625
Someday I want just, like,
a very small, small Lab.

01:52.625 --> 01:53.917
Please, tell him.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.750
Please, tell him
to take off his f***ing...

01:55.792 --> 01:58.208
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.125
- Just do it, man.
Come on.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.458
- Yeah.
- There we go.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.458
- Yeah!

02:03.458 --> 02:05.292
- I'm a little insecure,
because I don't see

02:05.333 --> 02:06.958
a lot of dad bods.

02:06.958 --> 02:08.958
Everyone's, like, ripped,
and tan, and gorgeous,

02:08.958 --> 02:12.417
and I'm feeling
a little insecure over here.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.750
- It's Peter's birthday
and, like, we wanted to--

02:13.792 --> 02:15.833
- Oh.
- Who's Peter?

02:15.875 --> 02:17.333
- Peter has the longer hair.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.958
- This is the "I'm in
a relationship dance."

02:20.000 --> 02:22.333
I'm in the best relationship
of my life, ever.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.292
- We don't need a ring or
anything to know, like,

02:24.333 --> 02:25.333
where we're at.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.833
- You're probably already there.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.417
- I mean, dude,
I'm--I'm f***ing proud.

02:28.458 --> 02:29.917
- I mean, guys,
we could be a little cool.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.583
I mean, we don't have
to walk around with signs

02:31.625 --> 02:33.833
around our necks saying, "We are
in committed relationships."

02:33.875 --> 02:38.250
- I have--Jax--
zero temptation right now.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.458
- Oh, yeah. Me too.
- Not even 1%.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.000
- I mean, if we say it
enough in our heads,

02:42.042 --> 02:43.500
it might even turn true.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.417
- I like this.
I like this us.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.000
We are at a pool party
with alcohol,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.500
and there are girls
wearing hardly anything,

02:50.500 --> 02:52.083
but that doesn't mean
we're shut-ins...

02:52.125 --> 02:53.167
- Whoa, hi.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.833
- Or rude to people.

02:54.875 --> 02:55.833
- I love you.

02:55.875 --> 02:56.958
- Let's be honest.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.292
We are going
to keep on drinking...

02:59.333 --> 03:00.375
- Watch this. Watch this.

03:00.417 --> 03:01.375
- And drinking...

03:01.417 --> 03:02.625
- Whoo!

03:02.667 --> 03:04.333
- And drinking.

03:04.375 --> 03:05.375
- I can't stop it.

03:05.375 --> 03:06.750
- It's not really our fault.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.458
- Peter,
where are you taking us now?

03:15.500 --> 03:16.708
- We're eating.
- Okay.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.708
- Peeter's in charge now.

03:19.708 --> 03:20.833
- God, I'm hurting.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.542
- I'm hurting.
- Hurting

03:22.583 --> 03:24.792
- You guys,
first and foremost,

03:24.833 --> 03:26.333
I am way too drunk
for my own good.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.792
- Yeah, tell...
- He's laughing at me.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.167
- Why are you-
- He knows I'm drunk.

03:30.208 --> 03:32.333
- He's so wasted.
- I know. I know.

03:34.042 --> 03:36.250
- Dude, I lost count,
I lost count.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.500
- White-girl wasted.

03:38.542 --> 03:41.250
- Top ten most wasted
I've ever been in my life.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.083
- I want to say top five.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.250
- Thank you, Jax.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.000
- Top five.
- I'm struggling.

03:46.042 --> 03:49.500
I'm, like, still drunk,
still hammered.

03:49.542 --> 03:52.083
You overindulge
in every capacity,

03:52.083 --> 03:53.875
The maturity level falls.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.583
The IQ falls.

03:55.625 --> 03:56.917
- How did you sleep last night?

03:56.917 --> 03:58.667
That was awesome.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.667
- Dude, you got a lot of ass
this weekend, straight up.

04:15.250 --> 04:19.625
You ravaged me.

04:30.958 --> 04:33.458
- You all need
to f***ing grow up.

04:37.417 --> 04:40.292
This is why I get excited
about these guys' trips.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.958
Yeah, weird-ass s*** like this.

04:42.958 --> 04:47.292
Hey, guys, you're being drunken
idiots but not ass****.

04:47.292 --> 04:49.625
- There you go.
- There you go.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.792
- To never drinking Fireball
again, ever

04:52.792 --> 04:55.292
- Schwartz is kind of like
their punching bag at times.

04:55.292 --> 04:56.792
- We do pick on him.
- But, like, in a loving way.

04:56.833 --> 04:58.417
- You don't understand the
hazing I went through, Andy.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.667
- He's like a little brother.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.333
- And it's so much fun.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.833
We have so many ideas.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.125
They're always going like,
"We should do this.

05:04.167 --> 05:05.292
We should do this."

05:05.333 --> 05:07.250
- Doesn't that sound
like something out of,

05:07.292 --> 05:08.333
like, second grade?

05:08.333 --> 05:09.833
- It makes me laugh.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.167
- How can you not laugh at it,
Andy?

05:11.208 --> 05:13.833
I mean,
it's kind of ridiculous.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.000
- Lisa, everyone
knows there's not

05:15.042 --> 05:16.500
a bigger animal lover than you.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.000
How many animals do you have
right now at Villa Rosa?

05:19.042 --> 05:21.958
- I have seven turtles,
eight swans,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.750
two ponies,
and eight dogs.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.292
So what's that, 25?
I don't know.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.792
- It's bordering
on Neverland, is it not?

05:26.833 --> 05:28.125
- Well, yeah, it probably is.

05:28.167 --> 05:29.792
- Is this within code?

05:29.833 --> 05:32.000
- I'm zoned for horses
and livestockm,

05:32.000 --> 05:33.958
wild animals,
so yes.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.958
- Can you name them all?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.667
- Do I have to?

05:42.708 --> 05:45.708
Now, you guys,
are you hungry?

05:45.708 --> 05:47.292
Hanky?

05:47.333 --> 05:48.292
- Hanky, come on.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.042
- Hanky's really put on weight.

05:50.042 --> 05:52.042
He's looking so much
better now, isn't he?

05:52.083 --> 05:53.542
- He's beautiful now.

05:53.542 --> 05:56.375
- I feel like we're running
a zoo here, don't you?

05:56.375 --> 05:58.792
I guess I'm like the old lady
with a lot of cats.

05:58.833 --> 06:00.500
I have a lot of animals.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.667
Come on, bath time.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.167
Come here.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.625
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.875
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

06:07.917 --> 06:10.500
Come on.

06:10.542 --> 06:12.542
Now hold her ass still
for a second.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.042
And look what I'm doing.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.375
And I'm washing a horse's ass.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.625
I have Pikachu, Giggy.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.042
Oh, hold on one second
and let me think about it.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.875
Pink Dog, Lollipop,
Pikachu, Giggy.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.708
f***.
What's wrong with me?

06:27.750 --> 06:29.917
- An armful of puppies.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.667
Take Little Man.

06:31.708 --> 06:34.417
- Little Man,
Little Man's okay, isn't he?

06:34.417 --> 06:35.708
Let me try and do it again.
Okay.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.875
I have Pink Dog, Pikachu,
Giggy, Lollipop, Daddio,

06:38.917 --> 06:41.750
Rumpy, Pumpy, Diamond's Rose.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.542
I have Hanky, Panky,
six other swans,

06:44.583 --> 06:47.542
seven turtles,
and a pot-bellied pig.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.292
But sometimes I call him
my husband.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.708
I mean, is that eccentric?

06:52.750 --> 06:54.583
Yes it is.
Am I apologizing for it?

06:54.583 --> 06:55.542
No, I am not.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.250
Come on, Pink Dog.

06:58.250 --> 07:02.333
- Schwartz, are the mini ponies
scarier in person?

07:02.375 --> 07:04.958
- That was f***ing hilarious.
- So funny.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.542
- Dude.
Oh, s***.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.750
Come here. Come here. Come here.
S***. Go to go back.

07:08.792 --> 07:11.125
- Schwartzie, are you crazy?

07:11.125 --> 07:12.625
Take him out.
He's gonna do a big poop.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.917
- Come on.
Oh, God.

07:14.958 --> 07:16.458
I'm scared of horses.

07:16.458 --> 07:18.792
That whole moment was kind of
like a fantasy for me, you know.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.417
It's like the ponies
are coming in, the white ponies,

07:21.458 --> 07:24.292
and Lisa comes down the stairs
in a robe.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.083
It was, like,
I've had that dream,

07:26.125 --> 07:27.292
that fantasy before.

07:27.292 --> 07:30.750
And it was all happening;
it was just, like...

07:30.792 --> 07:32.458
- Schwartz,
one of your high points

07:32.458 --> 07:33.625
was when you told Katie

07:33.625 --> 07:35.792
that she was never
really a model.

07:35.833 --> 07:38.875
- I was trying to transition
out of acting and modeling.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.292
- You never did it
in the first place,

07:40.292 --> 07:41.417
so don't compare
what you did to me.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.583
- Never did what?

07:42.625 --> 07:46.333
- You never-- I mean,
acting and modeling, really.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.667
I guess I was a little--
I was--

07:47.667 --> 07:49.667
- I mean--like, I mean,
I wasn't as much a model

07:49.667 --> 07:51.167
as I was into acting.

07:51.167 --> 07:52.958
I'd done, like, theater since
I was, like, seven years old.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.833
Like, it was, like,
the one thing I knew how to do

07:55.833 --> 07:57.167
and do well
from the time I was little,

07:57.167 --> 07:59.167
and so for him to be like,
"Well, what have you done?"

07:59.208 --> 08:00.833
I'm sorry.
What have you done?

08:00.833 --> 08:02.167
- Oh, I've booked
a decent amount of work.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.792
- Oh, the music video
and the suit of arms?

08:03.833 --> 08:05.167
- What are you talking--
I've booked a ton of jobs--

08:05.208 --> 08:07.500
- Oh, my God.
- Are you serious?

08:07.500 --> 08:08.667
Do you want me to go
down the list?

08:08.708 --> 08:10.167
- No, but do you know how
hurtful it is

08:10.167 --> 08:11.167
and how dismissive it is?

08:11.167 --> 08:12.417
- No, because you-

08:12.458 --> 08:15.125
- Katie, you called his goals
a pipe dream.

08:15.167 --> 08:16.167
- It is a pipe dream.

08:16.167 --> 08:17.500
- No, it's not.
- It's not.

08:17.542 --> 08:19.333
Being, like,
in the modeling industry

08:19.333 --> 08:21.667
is an every day commitment.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.167
You wake up every morning;
you have to submit yourself.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.750
You have to chase down
every job.

08:25.792 --> 08:27.542
It's really easy
to come out here

08:27.542 --> 08:29.208
and get lost in the sauce.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.167
- ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

08:31.208 --> 08:33.042
♪ It's time to get ♪

08:33.042 --> 08:34.292
- What's up?

08:34.333 --> 08:36.167
- How you doing?
- Good, man.

08:36.208 --> 08:38.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:38.042 --> 08:39.042
Oh.
- Oh, my God.

08:39.042 --> 08:40.792
So I'm excited, you guys.

08:40.833 --> 08:43.208
- I've actually only done one
other photo shoot with Ariana

08:43.208 --> 08:45.500
and that was Lisa
and the '50s gear.

08:46.542 --> 08:48.042
- More attitude.

08:48.042 --> 08:49.625
Now work it.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.042
Have we got it?
- Cool, yeah.

08:51.042 --> 08:52.292
- Okay, good.

08:52.333 --> 08:53.708
- We both are building a career

08:53.750 --> 08:58.542
and having really good
pictures, fashion, headshot,

08:58.542 --> 08:59.708
they all really help...

08:59.750 --> 09:01.542
I'm gonna throw this jacket
over this vest.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.167
In getting yourself out there.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.042
I need about 35 minutes to get
into character if that's cool.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.833
- Tom has packed enough luggage

09:09.875 --> 09:12.250
to travel around the world
for this photo shoot.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.250
I did not bring
as much stuff as Tom.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.250
- Oh, okay.
No big deal.

09:16.250 --> 09:19.250
- My strategy
for photo shoot wardrobe

09:19.250 --> 09:22.917
is bring
the underneath essentials.

09:22.917 --> 09:24.750
This is all of my-

09:24.750 --> 09:26.208
- Oh, lingerie.
- Lingie-type stuff.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.750
- Okay, perfect perfect.

09:27.792 --> 09:31.250
- Tom's perspective is,
f*** the stylist.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.042
- This is just shoes.

09:33.083 --> 09:36.583
- I'm gonna bring everything
I've ever worn ever in my life.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.667
- It looked like we're moving
out of the house.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.250
- I did make two trips
to the car.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.167
- Tom can be a little
high-maintenance.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.333
- More pants.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.667
I brought some glasses too.

09:44.708 --> 09:47.333
- You really did bring a lot,
Tom.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.167
- I don't need makeup, right?

09:49.208 --> 09:50.458
- You could put a little bit on
if you want--

09:50.458 --> 09:51.625
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- Oh, okay.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.250
- I do need some makeup.

09:54.292 --> 09:55.875
Last thing
you ever want is to have, like,

09:55.917 --> 09:59.417
a different color face
than neck.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.458
Such a rookie move.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.458
So here we go.
I'm excited.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.458
Got to get into character.
My hair looks good.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.708
I got to bring on my sexy.

10:06.750 --> 10:07.958
Nice.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.583
Let's do this.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.792
- Ready?
- Yeah.

10:11.792 --> 10:12.792
- Nice.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.958
Nice.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.917
Ooh, that's a nice pose.
Don't move.

10:16.958 --> 10:20.292
- I'm in love with Tom
for his heart

10:20.292 --> 10:25.125
and his brain
and his thoughtful nature,

10:25.167 --> 10:26.792
but it's convenient

10:26.792 --> 10:29.417
that he's also
f***ing beautiful.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.417
- I love that.
Ariana, look at the camera.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.625
Right there.
That's perfect, yeah.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.750
- And he knows
how to take a picture.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.167
It works our well for today.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.250
- That's a wrap!

10:39.292 --> 10:41.333
- Yes.
- Whoo!

10:45.500 --> 10:49.333
- That's how we do it.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.292
- Because I don't want people
to know that we're not perfect.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.833
- I don't think
anybody thinks you have

10:53.833 --> 10:55.833
the perfect relationship,
Scheana.

10:55.833 --> 10:57.208
- Everybody does.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.083
- Kristen,
we saw you and James

11:06.125 --> 11:08.500
try to save the relationship
in couples' therapy,

11:08.542 --> 11:12.458
but what we didn't see is that
you went to a crystal healer.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.625
- A what?

11:13.667 --> 11:15.333
- What did you think
crystals could do for you?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.458
- I'll tell you; how about
anybody here will just tell you?

11:16.500 --> 11:18.042
- The thing is,
I'm a total, like,

11:18.083 --> 11:20.125
gypsy, freak, crystal believer.

11:20.167 --> 11:23.208
- James, what did you think
about the new age idea?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.875
- I think it was cool;
I mean, like,

11:24.917 --> 11:26.542
I'm open
to different things.

11:26.583 --> 11:30.375
I think crystals can do
good things for people.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.167
What are you doing, babe?
You staging it up?

11:32.208 --> 11:34.042
- Cleansing the energy.

11:34.042 --> 11:36.250
- Ooh, yes, cleanse me.

11:37.875 --> 11:42.875
So you think this crystal woman
is gonna help our relationship?

11:42.917 --> 11:44.208
- I hope so.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.375
James and I have been
arguing a lot lately,

11:46.375 --> 11:48.792
and we definitely have
our share of problems.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.833
I've done a lot of research
on crystal therapy.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.875
One crystal therapy session
is equivalent

11:53.875 --> 11:57.500
to ten actual therapy sessions,
so I'm down.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.375
- Hi, how are you, Heather?
- Good. How are you?

11:59.417 --> 12:00.750
- I'm Kristen.
- Nice to meet you.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.917
- So I was thinking the table?
- Okay.

12:03.917 --> 12:06.167
- Holy crap.
Look at that.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.917
Yeah, this is something
I can be down with, you know?

12:07.917 --> 12:10.583
I'm not too interested with
the whole f***ing therapy thing,

12:10.583 --> 12:11.750
You know, I think that's a bit
of a waste of money

12:11.750 --> 12:13.417
at this point,
but this crystal thing,

12:13.417 --> 12:15.042
let's do it.

12:15.083 --> 12:17.833
- What's great about stones is
that each stone has a meaning.

12:17.875 --> 12:22.083
This is about what's going on
right now in your life

12:22.125 --> 12:25.417
and how you can use
the energy of the Earth,

12:25.458 --> 12:27.750
and you obviously know
this isn't Aquarius.

12:27.792 --> 12:30.083
I'm humbled to be
in your energy,

12:30.125 --> 12:33.042
because there is an energy
of that kind of

12:33.083 --> 12:34.875
in the woods kind of thing too.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.375
So have you ever
had anything like that?

12:37.417 --> 12:39.792
- I've had this dream, like,
my whole life of,

12:39.792 --> 12:42.542
it's, like,
this planet or something that--

12:42.583 --> 12:44.083
it's, like, these, like,
purple flower things

12:44.125 --> 12:46.125
that I always dream about,
but it's, like, this field.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.625
There's, like,
this huge mountain,

12:47.667 --> 12:49.625
and there's, like,
woods going up it.

12:49.625 --> 12:52.125
But yeah, there's, like,
little levels on the way up too.

12:52.167 --> 12:54.208
Like, there's this one part
where there's, like--

12:54.250 --> 12:55.875
like, a waterslide
on the top of it,

12:55.917 --> 12:57.625
and I always slide down it.

12:58.958 --> 13:01.125
I've always been very,
like, into energy

13:01.167 --> 13:04.375
and, like, you know,
spirituality around the room

13:04.417 --> 13:06.125
and, like, in the Earth.

13:06.125 --> 13:09.750
Crystals are very,
like, high-energy,

13:09.792 --> 13:10.792
like, rocks, right?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.917
They're rocks?
I don't know.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.917
- So let's just set
the intention that today

13:14.958 --> 13:17.542
we're just gonna be
completely openhearted.

13:17.583 --> 13:18.792
- That's cool.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.500
- All right,
pick whichever ones you like.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.167
- You picked one
that I was gonna pick.

13:29.167 --> 13:30.500
- Which one were you gonna pick?
- That blue one.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.500
- Okay.

13:35.833 --> 13:39.292
You have one, two, three,
four, five, six.

13:39.333 --> 13:42.083
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.167
- So trippy.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.667
- Six is really
about having a time

13:45.667 --> 13:47.833
in your life
where love is important.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.500
- So tell me exactly
what happened.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.250
- Well, we didn't have sex,
Kristen.

13:51.292 --> 13:54.667
The truth is, you know, Jenna
and I were definitely boning.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.958
- What's interesting is that
there's a mutual respect there.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.625
- Stop coming here to my place
of work and f***ing

13:59.667 --> 14:01.042
s*** up for me.

14:01.042 --> 14:02.625
- You guys
really are on the same page.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.458
- Get the f*** out of my face.
- Ow!

14:04.500 --> 14:06.375
- So you guys
are an interesting duo together,

14:06.417 --> 14:09.292
intellectually stimulate
each other; that's for sure.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.958
- That's crazy.
- See, there's...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.875
- I feel great about the whole
crystal session, you know.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.667
Kristen,
I hope she feels the same way

14:15.708 --> 14:17.875
about the whole situation, so we
can both take our good energy

14:17.917 --> 14:20.958
and mesh it into
one perfect energy being.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.833
- Both are highly intuitive
people.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.500
You guys are tapped in.

14:24.542 --> 14:25.958
- I mean, I don't know if it
was because of the crystals

14:26.000 --> 14:27.208
or because I believed
in the crystals.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.708
Does it matter?

14:28.708 --> 14:32.208
When I've held crystals
in my bra, good things happen.

14:34.042 --> 14:38.458
- Schwartz, you said
that it was Jax's foot fetish

14:38.500 --> 14:40.708
for Brittany's feet
that first got them together.

14:40.750 --> 14:41.708
- That was a huge selling
point, Andy.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.417
- I do.
Her feet did sell me.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.875
Yeah, I was sold on them.
I love them.

14:46.917 --> 14:48.542
Those things went
right in my mouth right away.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.542
- Oh, my God.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.000
- Remember
when he first told us?

14:51.042 --> 14:52.833
He's like, "I made her put
the Converse on, barefoot,

14:52.875 --> 14:54.583
run around the block,
and then we hooked up."

14:54.583 --> 14:56.042
- I'm sorry;
everybody has a fetish

14:56.083 --> 14:57.083
whether they admit or not.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.250
Everybody has their thing.
I like feet.

15:04.917 --> 15:06.083
- Guys, this is great, huh?

15:06.125 --> 15:08.250
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.875
- Is this a mani-pedi party?

15:09.917 --> 15:11.583
- Scrubbies.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.167
- Wow, you're really good
at that.

15:13.208 --> 15:14.500
Just wrapped it
around my foot like that.

15:14.542 --> 15:15.875
- I thought you didn't like
to be touched?

15:15.917 --> 15:17.208
- Isn't that weird
that I have a foot fetish,

15:17.250 --> 15:18.375
but I hate people
touching my feet?

15:18.417 --> 15:19.833
- Really?
- Isn't that weird?

15:19.875 --> 15:20.917
- You told Brittany
to not wear sox, didn't you?

15:20.917 --> 15:22.583
- I did, I did.
- You sick puppy.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.417
- He likes when she wears shoes

15:27.458 --> 15:29.292
with no socks,
so they're extra stinky.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.542
- Ew.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.083
- I like--I like feet.

15:32.125 --> 15:34.292
I have a foot fetish.

15:34.292 --> 15:36.250
Everybody has fetishes, okay?

15:36.292 --> 15:38.208
Whether it's feet
or hands or back

15:38.250 --> 15:40.125
or ass or tits or whatever.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.708
It's what I like.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.042
Sorry.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.125
You know, why do you like
chocolate ice cream

15:44.125 --> 15:45.458
as opposed to vanilla?

15:45.458 --> 15:46.958
I don't know.
That's just what you like.

15:46.958 --> 15:48.625
You can't really help
what you like; it is what it is.

15:48.625 --> 15:50.292
- But it's the fact
that you like them stinky.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.458
- Ew.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.958
- Like I said,
we all have weird--

15:52.958 --> 15:54.792
we're all different people;
we all like certain things.

15:54.792 --> 15:57.958
- So you like stinky feet?
- It's just--I like them dirty.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.625
I don't know why.
Don't ask me why.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.292
- He throws them right
in his mouth; I've seen it.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.792
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yeah.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.292
- Yeah, he devours those things.
- She loves it.

16:04.292 --> 16:05.750
I've never had an issue with it.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.667
I don't think I could
date somebody with ugly feet.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.000
I think that's a deal breaker.

16:10.042 --> 16:11.333
Because even girls
that are kind of like,

16:11.375 --> 16:12.833
"Ooh, I'm weird about it,"
after a little while,

16:12.833 --> 16:14.083
they like it;
trust me.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.000
- Wow.
- He's weird.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.083
- A stinky foot
is like a fine cheese.

16:19.125 --> 16:21.000
They're in my mouth
right off the bat.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.000
I just like her little feet,
and I like them dirty.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I don't know.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.167
- Ew.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.958
- I know; it's gross.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.500
- But what do you like to do
with them? That's what--

16:31.542 --> 16:33.167
- He puts them in his mouth.
- In his mouth?

16:33.167 --> 16:35.333
He does?
Dirty feet in his mouth?

16:35.333 --> 16:36.750
- Dirty, smelly feet
in his mouth.

16:36.792 --> 16:38.125
- And you can relate to that?
- No

16:38.167 --> 16:39.500
- No.
- No, but respect it.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.750
- I love it.
I love it.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.667
- Okay, there's something else
I've been wanting to ask.

16:43.667 --> 16:46.625
Scheana, you said you wouldn't
date someone who was sober.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.208
- Date, initially.
- Okay.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.958
- But I really--
I think I drink the least

16:51.000 --> 16:52.542
out of almost everyone in here.

16:52.542 --> 16:55.792
So I'm not a person who,
like, encourages going out

16:55.833 --> 16:56.875
and getting s*** faced.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.542
- Just watching it myself,

16:58.583 --> 17:02.375
I was--I was taken
with your approach here.

17:05.708 --> 17:07.167
- Can I get something
to drink, baby?

17:07.208 --> 17:11.375
- Sure.
- Thank you.

17:11.375 --> 17:12.792
Thank you.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.042
- You're welcome.
- Oh.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.875
Thank you, dear.
- Uh-huh.

17:16.917 --> 17:20.042
I think Sandoval
is coming by in a bit.

17:20.083 --> 17:22.875
He is very persistent

17:22.917 --> 17:26.000
on helping Shay kind of
get out of this funk.

17:26.042 --> 17:27.125
- He's a good friend.

17:27.167 --> 17:30.042
- Yeah,
he was in our wedding.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.875
That makes me pretty sad.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.000
- Don't do that.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.250
- About six months ago,

17:34.292 --> 17:37.875
Shay had a really big problem
with the drinking,

17:37.917 --> 17:40.750
and I'm kind of worried
he's gonna go back to that.

17:40.750 --> 17:44.000
He's not sitting in that chair
right there like he always is.

17:44.042 --> 17:45.875
- We've got to get him back
to a good place

17:45.917 --> 17:48.250
so he feels good
about himself, you know?

17:48.250 --> 17:53.000
- I thought we were
in such a happy, good place,

17:53.042 --> 17:56.500
and now my whole world has just
been turned upside down.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.833
I didn't even tell,
like, our friends

17:57.875 --> 17:58.917
a lot of the stuff about him.

17:58.917 --> 18:00.417
I didn't even tell you,

18:00.417 --> 18:04.250
because I don't want people
to know that we're not perfect.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.875
- I don't think
anybody thinks you have

18:05.917 --> 18:07.917
the perfect relationship,
Scheana.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.083
- Everybody does.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.875
They just said it last week.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.458
I need more wine.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.625
Some people,
like myself,

18:17.625 --> 18:21.208
can just casually have a drink
and not think anything of it.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.375
Other people, like Shay,
have that personality

18:24.417 --> 18:26.125
where one drink just
isn't enough.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.958
It's something
not to be taken lightly.

18:28.958 --> 18:31.083
- Maybe next time you can have,
you know, the little berries.

18:31.125 --> 18:34.458
- I want to do my job the best
that I can to keep him on track

18:34.500 --> 18:36.417
and not have him
fall off the wagon.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.292
I'm gonna grab the bottle.

18:38.292 --> 18:40.083
- It's a bottle of wine night.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.375
Just bring
the whole thing in here

18:42.417 --> 18:43.792
because I bet we'll finish it.

18:43.792 --> 18:47.792
- What he needs to do
is learn how to cut back,

18:47.792 --> 18:50.458
how to not get drunk.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.458
- Hi.
- What's up?

18:52.500 --> 18:53.667
How you doing?
Good to see you.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.167
- Oh, you know,
I've been better.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.000
- I brought over some stuff
to make drinks,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.125
you know,
maybe help take the edge off,

18:59.167 --> 19:00.500
but it looks like
Scheana and her mom

19:00.500 --> 19:03.083
have already started
to take the edge off.

19:03.125 --> 19:04.125
Cheers.

19:04.167 --> 19:05.500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.167
- Do I double-fist it,
or I finish this

19:07.208 --> 19:08.333
and then go with this?

19:08.333 --> 19:11.125
- I think you pound that
like a shot,

19:11.167 --> 19:13.000
then drink this.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.333
Okay, chug, chug, chug.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.958
- It's not a shot, babe.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.833
- Look, Scheana's stressed out.
Her mom's stressed out.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.083
It's a drinking occasion.

19:22.125 --> 19:25.083
I fortunately don't have
an addictive personality.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.833
I've never had
an addiction problem.

19:27.833 --> 19:32.208
- What he needs to work on...

19:34.417 --> 19:35.792
Is drinking...

19:39.042 --> 19:41.042
- Not drinking so much.

19:41.042 --> 19:43.042
- I get it.
It's not that easy.

19:43.042 --> 19:45.875
I just don't personally
understand

19:45.875 --> 19:48.500
what that mental battle is like,

19:48.542 --> 19:51.542
because I fortunately
don't have that problem.

19:51.542 --> 19:53.333
So it's hard
for me to help someone

19:53.375 --> 19:55.667
with that problem
when I don't understand it.

19:57.542 --> 20:00.000
I need more wine.

20:00.042 --> 20:01.875
- Should I ask you,
like, awkward questions?

20:01.917 --> 20:03.125
How many times have you had sex?

20:15.250 --> 20:16.917
- I am not getting involved
in anger this soon.

20:16.917 --> 20:18.042
- Yeah,
that's what my other problem is,

20:18.083 --> 20:19.542
that you text me
all these nice things.

20:19.583 --> 20:21.583
- I'm Sweden or Switzerland
or...

20:21.583 --> 20:23.083
I'm gonna be--
- Switzerland.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.083
- Is it Switzerland?

20:24.125 --> 20:25.333
What is it?

20:25.375 --> 20:26.750
Switzerland.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.583
Because my metaphors are just
so off; it's ridiculous.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.250
You know, that country
that plays neutral?

20:31.250 --> 20:32.917
Sweden, Switzerland, I mean,

20:32.917 --> 20:34.875
they're kind of close
to each other, right?

20:34.917 --> 20:36.250
- It's Switzerland.
They're different countries.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.417
- All right.
Okay, tomato-tomahto.

20:38.417 --> 20:39.875
Oh, f*** it.
Canada.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.667
I know Kevin's had a crush
on her for a while now,

20:41.708 --> 20:43.417
but I do,
I want her f***ing bad.

20:43.458 --> 20:44.833
Well, sure enough, the next day,

20:44.875 --> 20:46.417
that guy came and buried
his own bridge.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.500
Buried--what?

20:48.875 --> 20:51.417
- I'm usually kind of the bunt
of all jokes.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.208
You want to kill 2 birds
with 13 stones.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.875
- That's not what it means.
- Yes, it does.

20:54.917 --> 20:56.750
- It's supposed to be kill
two birds with one stone.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.917
- No, you just kill 2 with,
like, 13 stones.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.583
He's a big boy;
he puts his pants just,

21:00.625 --> 21:02.625
you know, two feet at a time
like everybody else.

21:02.625 --> 21:03.958
- Usually it's one foot
at a time.

21:03.958 --> 21:07.083
- That's what I--what did I say,
two feet at a time?

21:07.125 --> 21:08.208
f***.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.792
It was like the--what do they--
what is it,

21:09.792 --> 21:11.292
the Monigles and the--
what was it

21:11.292 --> 21:12.917
from "Romeo and Juliet,"
the Capulets

21:12.958 --> 21:14.625
and the...
whatever they were.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.083
It's really no skin
off my nose ether way.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.917
- Is it "skin off my nose"
or "skin off my back?"

21:18.958 --> 21:20.292
- No, it's "the shirt
off your back."

21:20.333 --> 21:21.958
- Damn it.
I knew it.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.417
- It's "the shirt off your back"
and "the skin off your nose."

21:25.458 --> 21:27.375
God,
why am I so bad at these?

21:27.417 --> 21:29.458
We've all been, you know,
friends for,

21:29.458 --> 21:30.958
you know, cumulative--

21:30.958 --> 21:32.458
- Did you say cumulative?
I'm very proud if you.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.375
- Thank you. I know.
I was reaching for that word.

21:34.417 --> 21:35.792
I reached for it.

21:35.792 --> 21:37.375
I was looking for a word,
and I didn't know if that word

21:37.417 --> 21:40.417
was gonna fit,
but it did.

21:40.458 --> 21:41.500
Right?
I don't know.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.583
Cumulative.

21:43.625 --> 21:44.958
I swear.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.500
- Kristen, one thing
that I loved this year

21:46.500 --> 21:49.583
was the rise of Kristen
the serial dater.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.833
Kevin moved in,
then you were sucking face

21:51.833 --> 21:54.792
with Alex from "Below Deck."

21:54.833 --> 21:56.917
- Paying these bills
is brand-new to me.

21:56.958 --> 21:59.625
- Oh, really? You used
to being carried by the boys?

21:59.667 --> 22:01.167
- It's, like,
the most fun I ever had

22:01.208 --> 22:03.000
until I met Carter,
and now it's...

22:03.000 --> 22:04.750
- You'd have been single,
and, like--

22:04.792 --> 22:05.958
- I've never been single, ever.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.792
- We wanted her to be single
and have some fun.

22:07.833 --> 22:09.167
I don't think
she's ever been single.

22:09.167 --> 22:10.667
I didn't know what I wanted;
that was the thing.

22:10.667 --> 22:11.917
I knew what I didn't want,

22:11.958 --> 22:13.833
but I had no idea
what I wanted or what was even,

22:13.875 --> 22:15.000
like, out there.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.792
- I'm just, like, dating
too many people right now,

22:23.833 --> 22:25.375
and it gets confusing.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.042
- I don't think I've ever
done that in my entire life.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.000
- Neither have I; I don't know
what the f*** I'm doing.

22:29.042 --> 22:33.042
I'm not putting all my eggs
in one basket, though, because,

22:33.083 --> 22:35.208
I mean, obviously I'm going out
with Alex tonight.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.542
- Yeah, well,
you've only gone on one date.

22:36.542 --> 22:38.042
You can't out your eggs
in any basket.

22:38.042 --> 22:40.292
- That's true.
I don't spread my eggs, right?

22:40.333 --> 22:42.000
- Spread the eggs around.

22:42.042 --> 22:43.500
- Keep my eggs right
where they are.

22:43.542 --> 22:46.042
- Donate that s*** everywhere.

22:46.042 --> 22:47.375
- Alex just texted me.

22:47.417 --> 22:48.833
He is here.
He's coming up right now.

22:48.875 --> 22:50.208
Will you do me a fave?

22:50.208 --> 22:53.625
There is a bottle of Chardonnay
in the fridge.

22:53.667 --> 22:55.167
Will you just pour him
a glass of wine

22:55.208 --> 22:56.375
so I can change really fast?

22:56.417 --> 22:58.208
- Yep.

22:58.208 --> 23:00.375
I'm super excited
that Kristen's, like,

23:00.417 --> 23:02.333
being single
and putting herself out there

23:02.375 --> 23:03.833
and meeting lots of guys.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.250
I mean, I'm worried
on who she's, like,

23:07.292 --> 23:08.708
actually gonna settle on,

23:08.750 --> 23:10.375
because she hasn't been good
about that in the past.

23:10.417 --> 23:11.375
Hello.

23:11.417 --> 23:12.708
- Ola.
How are you?

23:12.750 --> 23:14.750
- Good. How are you?
- Good. Nice to see you.

23:14.750 --> 23:16.375
- I'm, like, Kristen's dad.

23:16.417 --> 23:17.583
She's still getting ready,

23:17.583 --> 23:19.083
so you're just
gonna have to wait around.

23:19.083 --> 23:21.083
- Typical.
Got anything to drink in here?

23:21.083 --> 23:23.542
- Yes, should I ask you,
like, awkward questions?

23:23.583 --> 23:24.708
- Yeah,

23:24.750 --> 23:26.083
- Like, what are your intentions
with my friend?

23:27.083 --> 23:28.542
We'll see where it goes.

23:28.583 --> 23:31.042
- Have you guys--how many times
have you had sex?

23:31.083 --> 23:32.542
- We haven't have had sex yet.

23:32.583 --> 23:33.750
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:33.750 --> 23:36.000
Kristen hasn't slept
with this guy yet?

23:36.042 --> 23:37.750
Wow, okay.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.417
I don't think she's, like,
100% into him,

23:40.417 --> 23:44.292
but that's, like, really
never stopped her before, so...

23:44.333 --> 23:47.250
See, she doesn't tell me
all these things.

23:47.292 --> 23:48.583
- What's up?
- Hey.

23:48.625 --> 23:49.625
You got a whole bottle?

23:49.667 --> 23:50.792
- Yeah, just for me.

23:50.792 --> 23:52.417
- How are you?
- Hi.

23:52.458 --> 23:54.917
- Oh, you guys
are so cute together.

23:54.958 --> 23:56.417
Your tans match.

23:56.458 --> 23:57.792
I feel like I should start
working on yachts

23:57.792 --> 23:59.917
so I can save money
on all my spray tans.

23:59.958 --> 24:02.792
Listen, I mean,
this Alex guy, he seems nice,

24:02.792 --> 24:04.792
and that's, like,
huge for Kristen.

24:04.792 --> 24:05.875
See you guys later.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.458
- Bye, Mom.
- Thanks, Mom.

24:07.458 --> 24:09.958
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Are you gonna make our bed?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.125
- No.
- See you.

24:12.167 --> 24:16.625
- Definitely not.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.458
- Jax, one thing we didn't see
was you

24:18.458 --> 24:20.625
showing off your new ink.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.625
- I know.
- What inspired the tattoo?

24:21.625 --> 24:23.917
- Oh, yeah.

24:23.958 --> 24:25.708
- Well, obviously,
I've been through hell

24:25.750 --> 24:26.958
and high water with these two,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.417
so it was just something
I wanted to do.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.958
I took them to the bouncy house,
and we had a moment.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.625
We had shots,
and I kind of did my reveal.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.667
- So romantic.
- Yeah, it was.

24:35.667 --> 24:37.958
- That is so romantic.
- "Bromantic.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.000
Hey, hey.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.500
- You again.
- I'm back.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.917
What's up, Brian?
- What's up, man? How you been?

24:50.958 --> 24:52.958
- Good to see you.
- It's been a little while.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.167
- I am back for another tattoo,

24:55.167 --> 24:58.000
and I'm back for another name

24:58.000 --> 24:59.667
as kind of a joke
to my two buddies

24:59.667 --> 25:01.792
who have stuck around with me
for so damn long,

25:01.833 --> 25:03.625
my two best friends,
Tom and Tom.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.500
They're like my brothers.
- You could do "Tom and I."

25:05.500 --> 25:07.000
- "Tom and I,"
but there's two Toms.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.208
So I got to do Tom--
- "Tom, Tom, and I."

25:08.208 --> 25:09.500
- "Tom, Tom, and I."

25:09.542 --> 25:11.208
- I think
that would be funny s***.

25:11.208 --> 25:12.625
- He's the expert.
- All right.

25:12.667 --> 25:15.333
Tom, Tom, and I, we've been
through a lot together,

25:15.375 --> 25:16.375
a lot of ups,
a lot of downs.

25:16.417 --> 25:17.833
Do you want to get
my name tattooed on you?

25:17.875 --> 25:19.333
- No, thanks.

25:19.375 --> 25:21.042
- The fact that we were able
to get through all of that

25:21.083 --> 25:24.208
and still be as close
as we are means a lot.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.125
- At least it's your boys
this time.

25:26.167 --> 25:29.333
- Yeah.
- You're learning.

25:31.708 --> 25:33.958
- You got tattooed here
four times?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.375
- About three years ago, I
thought it would be a good idea

25:36.417 --> 25:39.500
to get my ex-girlfriend's
name, Stasi,

25:39.542 --> 25:41.500
hoping that
maybe it would win her back.

25:41.542 --> 25:45.375
- Let me see the inside
of your arm.

25:45.417 --> 25:47.042
- Oh, my God.

25:47.042 --> 25:48.542
Oh, my God.

25:48.542 --> 25:51.208
That didn't really work out,
so I waited about a year later,

25:51.250 --> 25:53.875
I covered that up
with a black rose.

25:53.917 --> 25:55.083
Oh, it looks great.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.917
Oh, I'm so happy.

25:56.917 --> 26:00.250
Then I decided to get in another
relationship with Carmen,

26:00.292 --> 26:03.583
who I'd been dating,
oh, I don't know, a month,

26:03.625 --> 26:08.500
and decided to put
her name on this arm.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.375
Then I broke up with her,

26:13.417 --> 26:15.583
decided to date somebody else,

26:15.625 --> 26:18.750
and we decided to cover that up
with Tiffany's favorite flower

26:18.750 --> 26:21.375
which is a lily.

26:21.417 --> 26:22.708
That's really good.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.083
That's clean.
I like that.

26:28.125 --> 26:29.083
That looks good, right?
Nice and clean.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.792
- Oh, yeah.
It looks perfect.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.292
Best friends forever.
- It's on there.

26:35.833 --> 26:37.125
She's like,
"Best friends forever."

26:37.125 --> 26:38.458
- It's true.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.458
- Whee!

26:43.458 --> 26:44.625
- Hey, boys.

26:44.667 --> 26:45.625
Tom.
- Yeah.

26:45.667 --> 26:47.083
- Tom, come here for a second.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.125
But I got to take you
in the bounce house

26:48.125 --> 26:49.958
to talk about something.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.417
- This is a safe zone; you can
tell all your secrets in here.

26:53.458 --> 26:55.417
This better be good.

26:55.458 --> 26:58.792
- So yesterday,
I went with Brittany

26:58.792 --> 27:02.250
to a little place
that we're all familiar with.

27:02.292 --> 27:07.125
So here it is,
"Tom, Tom, and I."

27:07.125 --> 27:09.375
Holy s***, dude.

27:09.417 --> 27:12.125
- Dude, you're f***ing--
that's not permanent.

27:12.125 --> 27:13.417
- It's very, very permanent.

27:13.458 --> 27:14.583
- It looks fake.

27:14.625 --> 27:16.458
- So you guys
are my two best friends,

27:16.500 --> 27:18.500
and I figured,
listen, all the s***

27:18.542 --> 27:20.625
that I f***ing put you guys
through--over in life,

27:20.667 --> 27:23.458
I figured the least I can do
is f***ing brand myself

27:23.500 --> 27:24.667
with your guys' names.

27:24.667 --> 27:25.958
- I think you just
jinxed us, though.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.625
No.

27:27.667 --> 27:29.000
- I would like to think
that having my name

27:29.000 --> 27:31.167
tattooed on Jax's arm
is permanent,

27:31.167 --> 27:33.458
but there's a lot
of flowers on his arm

27:33.500 --> 27:35.125
that suggest otherwise.

27:35.167 --> 27:36.333
- Holy s***.
It's raised.

27:36.375 --> 27:38.167
It is real.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.500
- Wow, man, I'm honored.

27:39.542 --> 27:41.083
I mean, like,
I'm f***ing touched.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.333
- Dude,
I'm f***ing touched for real...

27:42.333 --> 27:43.417
- Okay.
- Sincerely touched.

27:43.458 --> 27:44.667
- Good.
- Yeah, thanks, Jax.

27:44.667 --> 27:46.292
- Cheers. No problem.
- I love you, dude.

27:46.333 --> 27:47.667
- Love you guys.
- Jeez, man. Love you dude.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.500
- We're in rare company,
you know?

27:49.500 --> 27:51.333
I'd say, like,
maybe one in five people

27:51.333 --> 27:54.583
he meets get a tattoo
on his body, so it's an honor.

27:54.625 --> 27:55.792
- All right, dude.
- Bring it in.

27:55.833 --> 27:57.042
- Bring it in.
- Yes.

27:57.083 --> 27:58.375
- When's the last time
we all hugged?

27:58.375 --> 27:59.542
- I don't know.
- Dude, seriously.

27:59.542 --> 28:00.542
when's the last time
we all hugged?

28:00.542 --> 28:03.292
- Whoo!

28:03.333 --> 28:04.833
- You cut a hole
in the middle

28:04.875 --> 28:07.167
the size
of your man's yumminess.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.958
- I'm just gonna pop into
Whole Foods real quick.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.667
- Ariana, how have you enjoyed
having Lala around Sur?

28:19.708 --> 28:21.208
- I like her.

28:21.208 --> 28:24.833
I think that, you know,
she riles people's feathers,

28:24.875 --> 28:26.542
and she gets a kick
out of doing it,

28:26.583 --> 28:28.125
and so, of course,

28:28.167 --> 28:30.958
she's gonna rub some people
the wrong way, and that's fine.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.958
Whatever; she's never
done anything to anybody.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.708
- I know that I can come off
a certain way

28:34.750 --> 28:36.083
when you first meet me.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.708
Some people are like,
"Okay, like, I get her."

28:38.750 --> 28:41.083
And then there are people
where it's like,

28:41.083 --> 28:43.250
"I'm gonna keep you
at arm's length."

28:53.417 --> 28:55.417
How are you?
- Good.

28:55.417 --> 28:58.000
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

28:58.042 --> 29:00.250
- So while we thought we had
a wild and crazy

29:00.292 --> 29:02.042
girls' night,
which...

29:02.083 --> 29:04.208
- Oh, I heard about it.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.667
- Fifa decided that she was
gonna give us a lesson in--

29:06.708 --> 29:07.875
- Grapefruiting.

29:07.917 --> 29:10.250
Have you never
grapefruited anybody before?

29:10.250 --> 29:12.333
- I mean, this sounds like
some Urban Dictionary s***,

29:12.375 --> 29:14.083
but apparently it's a thing.

29:14.125 --> 29:15.750
- I haven't really heard of it,
and I've done some freaky s***

29:15.750 --> 29:16.750
in my life, so...

29:16.792 --> 29:18.708
Lala can act super flirtatious.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.583
It's, like, damn.
I f***ing like that.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.125
I think that's hot as f***.

29:22.125 --> 29:23.958
- You just take,
like, a grapefruit,

29:23.958 --> 29:25.625
and you cut it
in half, obviously.

29:25.625 --> 29:26.958
Then you cut a hole
in the middle

29:26.958 --> 29:29.208
the size
of your man's yumminess.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.458
- Right.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.458
- And then you move it up
and down

29:32.500 --> 29:33.625
while you give him head.

29:33.667 --> 29:36.125
And so it feels
like he's up in there,

29:36.125 --> 29:38.292
but he's blindfolded,
so he's like, "Oh, my gosh.

29:38.292 --> 29:39.958
What? Like I have no--
what's happening?"

29:40.000 --> 29:41.458
- I feel like that could
get really messy.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.708
I don't think--

29:42.750 --> 29:44.250
- Messy's good, girl.

29:44.292 --> 29:46.458
- I don't think I'll be trying
that out myself anytime soon.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.625
- You know, for this being
a sexy unique restaurant,

29:49.667 --> 29:51.792
there are a lot
of prudes working here.

29:51.792 --> 29:54.750
- You're a guy; if you got
any kind of acidic juice

29:54.792 --> 29:56.250
on the tip of your wiener,
would it hurt?

29:56.292 --> 29:57.542
- I think if it was, like,
on the tip,

29:57.583 --> 29:59.292
it wouldn't bother me,
quite frankly.

29:59.333 --> 30:00.958
But I think if it went inside,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.833
yeah, I mean,
it can sting a little bit.

30:02.833 --> 30:04.292
- Well, that's why you got
to blindfold your man,

30:04.333 --> 30:05.958
because of he sees it
he's gonna be like,

30:06.000 --> 30:07.125
"That is gonna burn me so bad."

30:07.167 --> 30:08.958
- Be like, "Babe,
what's that smell?"

30:09.000 --> 30:10.917
- That's crazy.
- I'm not, like, a prude.

30:10.958 --> 30:12.417
But this conversation is making
me feel a little uncomfortable.

30:12.458 --> 30:13.958
- Oh, my God.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.167
- So you're just gonna waste
a grapefruit like that?

30:16.167 --> 30:18.583
For me, the grocery store
is not a sex shop.

30:18.625 --> 30:22.250
It's where I go to buy stuff
that I'm going to eat,

30:22.292 --> 30:26.750
not put in or around
anyone's genitalia.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.250
- It's just, like,
happiness for everybody.

30:29.292 --> 30:30.792
- Happiness all around, Lala.

30:30.833 --> 30:32.167
That's what it's about.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.833
I'm just gonna pop
into Whole Foods real quick.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.000
I'll be back in a second.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.375
I enjoyed that.
Thanks, guys.

30:37.833 --> 30:40.000
- Okay, let's switch gears
for a second.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.500
Jax, we got a lot
of tweets about your mom.

30:42.542 --> 30:45.208
- She's a wonderful person,
and I love her very much.

30:45.208 --> 30:46.792
- How did she give birth to Jax?

30:46.833 --> 30:48.667
- I know.
Jax, what happened?

30:48.708 --> 30:49.708
- I have no idea.

30:55.542 --> 30:56.542
- I love going to get ice cream

30:56.583 --> 30:57.667
after a night
of drinking Fireball.

30:57.708 --> 30:59.333
- Let's do it downtown.

30:59.375 --> 31:02.000
This is the creamery
I wanted to take you to, Mom.

31:02.042 --> 31:03.667
- Peddler's Creamery.

31:03.708 --> 31:07.000
- This is my mom's first time
really exploring California

31:07.042 --> 31:08.542
and meeting all my friends
for the first time.

31:08.542 --> 31:10.167
- Is it good?

31:10.208 --> 31:11.458
- Knowing my friends,
I feel like they're gonna be

31:11.500 --> 31:13.667
on a mission
to embarrass me a little bit.

31:13.708 --> 31:14.958
And I feel like my mom,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.458
she's gonna be out
to embarrass me as well.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.542
- Do you refer to him
as Jax or Jason?

31:20.542 --> 31:22.292
- I refer to him as Jason.

31:23.417 --> 31:25.083
Jason or Jay.

31:25.083 --> 31:28.750
- Jax's mom is so sweet,
and I'm thinking to myself,

31:28.792 --> 31:30.583
"Was Jax adopted?"

31:30.625 --> 31:34.042
- He was like, "Hey, dude, can
I, uh, can I stay on your couch

31:34.083 --> 31:35.875
for, like,
a week or something? "

31:35.917 --> 31:37.083
And I'm like, "Okay, well, I
know it's not gonna be a week."

31:37.083 --> 31:39.250
- No,
but tell them what he said.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.208
- And I said,
"Tell him that's fine

31:41.250 --> 31:43.250
as long as he's not too big
of a presence."

31:44.458 --> 31:45.667
The biggest, loudest,

31:45.708 --> 31:48.583
most-in-your-face
human being ever.

31:48.583 --> 31:50.083
- He had the air mattress,
right?

31:50.083 --> 31:51.167
- He would come in
and let the air

31:51.208 --> 31:52.417
out at 4:00 in the morning

31:52.458 --> 31:54.375
and then I would just wake up
and be on the floor.

31:54.417 --> 31:55.833
- After I let the air out,
it wasn't funny anymore,

31:55.875 --> 31:58.250
so then I started taking
steak knives and stabbing it.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.500
- And it was so depressing.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.083
As if my life wasn't bad enough
at that moment.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.917
I mean, I had no money,
you know.

32:04.917 --> 32:07.583
Did he not get scolded
enough as a child?

32:07.625 --> 32:09.625
- He's always
had that cute smile

32:09.625 --> 32:13.208
and always doing things for,
you know, the moment.

32:13.250 --> 32:15.625
Jason--and everyone knows--
is ADD.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.750
I spent most of his childhood

32:18.792 --> 32:22.417
with teachers, principals,
neighborhood families,

32:22.458 --> 32:24.292
pretty much everywhere
explaining

32:24.333 --> 32:26.292
the mind of Jason Taylor.

32:26.333 --> 32:27.625
My God, do you know
how many times

32:27.667 --> 32:29.625
that boy's lived in his room?

32:29.625 --> 32:31.542
Grounding him
was just ridiculous.

32:31.583 --> 32:35.750
You had to mow many lawns
for many weeks to apologize,

32:35.792 --> 32:38.125
but it's the ADD kid
that needs the attention.

32:38.167 --> 32:40.542
Good or bad, it didn't matter
as long as it was attention.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.708
- That makes so much sense.

32:42.750 --> 32:45.458
- A little medication

32:45.500 --> 32:47.417
probably wouldn't hurt
at this point in your life.

32:47.458 --> 32:48.750
They've come out
with some great things.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.000
- Yeah.
- He's a grown man now.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.125
I can't ground him anymore
or I certainly would, Tom.

32:52.167 --> 32:54.750
- I'm thinking now that
you're here and we're with you,

32:54.792 --> 32:59.625
maybe you could grant me and Tom
the power to ground Jax.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.292
- Absolutely.

33:01.333 --> 33:03.333
- So we'll get one
of those dog collars,

33:03.333 --> 33:05.083
like the bark collars.

33:05.125 --> 33:07.958
- He might get used
to that and start liking it.

33:09.708 --> 33:11.792
- That girl is
a f***ing piece of s***,

33:11.833 --> 33:15.000
disgusting, kangaroo pouch,
chain smoking,

33:15.042 --> 33:16.875
piece of s*** whore.

33:42.208 --> 33:43.708
- Hi.
- Hey, girl.

33:43.750 --> 33:46.208
- How are you, girl?
- What's up?

33:46.208 --> 33:49.042
- Having Jesse at Sur is great.

33:49.083 --> 33:51.042
He's one of my best friends,

33:51.042 --> 33:54.042
and being at a big,
gay pool party

33:54.042 --> 33:56.208
as a woman is amazing

33:56.208 --> 33:58.375
because none of these dudes
are checking me out

33:58.375 --> 33:59.792
or trying to hit on me.

33:59.833 --> 34:03.375
They just want to dance,
get drunk, and have some fun.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.292
Wait, so is Jax coming?
- I think so.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.708
- You know, I was thinking,
Jesse invited us

34:07.750 --> 34:09.708
to a pool party, it's like,
"Okay, cool," you know?

34:09.708 --> 34:12.250
Girls in bikinis.
Have a few drinks.

34:12.292 --> 34:16.167
I show up, there's
about 500 dudes in Speedos.

34:16.208 --> 34:17.417
This is not
what I signed up for.

34:17.417 --> 34:19.750
- So is this gonna get,
like, crazy over here?

34:19.750 --> 34:21.708
- Well, Kristen
and James are coming,

34:21.750 --> 34:25.083
so that answers that question.

34:25.083 --> 34:28.000
- Oh, ooh, whoo!

34:28.042 --> 34:31.750
- Oh, s***.
- What's up, guys?

34:31.750 --> 34:34.708
Is it a party or are we going
to court right now?

34:34.750 --> 34:36.042
- Oh, God.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.250
I'm ready to go.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.417
Kristen and James
are both the kind of people

34:39.417 --> 34:41.583
who have to prove
to the world

34:41.625 --> 34:43.250
how awesome
and great their lives

34:43.250 --> 34:45.583
are by sticking their tongue
down each other's throats.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.250
- Give me that!

34:47.292 --> 34:49.250
- Oh!

34:49.292 --> 34:51.208
- This is all about respect,

34:51.250 --> 34:53.958
and right now Kristen
is not respecting the fact

34:54.000 --> 34:55.917
that I do not want
to lose my lunch

34:55.958 --> 34:58.292
and puke all over
the awesome gay pool party.

34:58.292 --> 35:01.292
That girl is a f***ing piece
of s***, disgusting,

35:01.292 --> 35:03.625
kangaroo pouch,
chain smoking,

35:03.625 --> 35:05.125
piece of s*** whore.

35:05.125 --> 35:08.125
I don't bother myself
with people like that.

35:08.167 --> 35:10.958
- Look around.
There's hundreds of people here.

35:10.958 --> 35:12.083
We're all having fun.

35:12.125 --> 35:13.458
Even if Kristen's here,

35:13.500 --> 35:16.042
you're still allowed
to have some fun.

35:18.125 --> 35:19.125
- We're gonna go
check out the clothes.

35:19.167 --> 35:20.792
You want to come?

35:20.792 --> 35:23.458
Try on some Speedos.
It's kind of intimidating.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.625
These guys are,
like, in really good shape.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.875
I mean, they're all,
like, jacked and ripped.

35:28.917 --> 35:30.792
- Can I get the ones
that say radical on the ass?

35:30.792 --> 35:33.667
- Duh, those are perfect.

35:33.708 --> 35:36.000
- Maybe I'll try the 33s or 32s.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.250
- Yeah, here they are.

35:37.292 --> 35:39.917
- Wow, look at
those tighty-ass-whities.

35:39.958 --> 35:41.958
- Tighty whities.
- Oh, my God.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.292
Those are ridiculous.
- He bought them for me.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.250
- Dude, they were white when
I bought them for you though.

35:46.292 --> 35:47.792
That's not white.
- This is the first time

35:47.833 --> 35:49.000
I've worn them.
- At least they're designer.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.917
They look so cute.

35:50.958 --> 35:52.833
- Underwear.

35:52.875 --> 35:55.292
- I'm not really confident
enough yet to wear those.

35:55.333 --> 35:56.750
- Spare me.

35:56.792 --> 35:58.500
- You've got to remember,
I got my winter bod right now.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.167
Summer bod is on its way.

36:00.208 --> 36:03.083
I'm not Speedo ready,

36:03.125 --> 36:05.667
but I'm nowhere near a dad bod.

36:05.667 --> 36:07.667
Maybe I've let
myself go a little bit,

36:07.667 --> 36:09.000
but that's normal.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.833
I mean, I'm in a relationship.

36:11.875 --> 36:14.167
- Put that s*** on right now.

36:14.167 --> 36:15.958
- I'm just thinking,
"When in Rome."

36:16.000 --> 36:19.875
And this is some Caligula s***
going on here, so why not?

36:19.917 --> 36:22.375
- No!
- Oh, no.

36:22.417 --> 36:25.000
God, I saw
your penis and your balls.

36:31.583 --> 36:34.375
- Oh, my God, stop it.
- No, you need to put that away.

36:34.375 --> 36:37.000
- I don't know
what it is about guys,

36:37.042 --> 36:39.458
when they put a Speedo on,
that they immediately want

36:39.500 --> 36:40.875
to start bouncing
their junk around.

36:40.875 --> 36:42.375
- No!
- No, no!

36:42.417 --> 36:45.458
- Maybe if I had a package,
I would feel differently,

36:45.500 --> 36:47.708
but I don't understand it.

36:47.750 --> 36:49.708
- I like to tease them
a little bit and be unbuttoned.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.292
- Oh!

36:51.333 --> 36:52.292
- Are you a little
hungry right now?

36:52.333 --> 36:53.875
Oh, my God.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.042
- Oh!

37:00.083 --> 37:01.375
- Hey, it's
the middle of the day.

37:01.417 --> 37:03.750
It's gorgeous out.
We got a pool party.

37:03.750 --> 37:05.583
So what if it's gay?
It's f***ing awesome.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.208
If you don't like it,
you can suck it.

37:07.250 --> 37:09.208
- One, two, three.

37:14.958 --> 37:18.583
- By a show of hands,
who would have left Jax in jail?

37:18.583 --> 37:21.417
- For the day, we were--
- Yeah, just for a week or so.

37:21.458 --> 37:23.250
- We were totally okay
with that.

37:23.250 --> 37:24.583
- Oh, my God.

37:24.583 --> 37:26.583
Oh, my God.

37:26.625 --> 37:29.583
Here we have the dumbass
of the f***ing century.

37:29.583 --> 37:32.375
He gets arrested in Hawaii
for getting too f***ed up

37:32.417 --> 37:36.125
and stealing some f***ing
$300 plastic sunglasses.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.792
I'm f***ing so happy about this.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.958
I'm sorry, I don't
feel bad one part.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.750
You're like,
"Oh you're dumb, mate."

37:44.792 --> 37:47.917
Like, you are the most ignorant,
stupid piece of s***

37:47.958 --> 37:49.792
I think I've ever
seen in my life.

37:49.833 --> 37:52.875
Not to mention it was
a mere five days ago

37:52.917 --> 37:55.375
when you were
calling me a liability.

37:55.417 --> 37:56.625
I just heard about
the Hawaii trip.

37:56.667 --> 37:58.958
I just wanted to know,
like, where I stood.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.208
- Like, you're a liability.
- f***ing Jax is an idiot.

38:02.250 --> 38:03.625
An absolute fool.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.958
Like, how embarrassing
for Brittany.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.208
It's like, "This is the man
that you're dating, honey.

38:08.250 --> 38:09.375
This is the man."

38:09.417 --> 38:11.292
- I'm just in shock right now.

38:11.292 --> 38:12.750
- I can't even call him a man.

38:12.792 --> 38:15.125
He's like a f***ing
four-year-old child

38:15.167 --> 38:17.208
that's eaten
too much candy that steals

38:17.250 --> 38:19.417
this f***ing toy
that his mom won't buy for him.

38:19.458 --> 38:22.417
- I'm sorry.
I feel like an idiot.

38:22.458 --> 38:23.667
- It's like, "Mate,

38:23.708 --> 38:25.417
buy yourself
some f***ing glasses."

38:25.458 --> 38:28.167
Like, ugh, he's
such a douche bag.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.458
What the hell were you thinking?

38:30.500 --> 38:34.333
You know, this is just
such a win-win-win-win for me.

38:34.375 --> 38:37.417
I'm winning so hard right now,
and Jax is losing so hard.

38:37.458 --> 38:40.292
Now, Lala's gonna see the piece
of s*** he truly is.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.625
- After this trip, I'm like,

38:42.667 --> 38:45.750
"You could not be
any more unattractive to me."

38:45.792 --> 38:47.792
- It's gonna also show Lisa

38:47.833 --> 38:50.333
that Jax
is the irresponsible prick

38:50.375 --> 38:52.167
that you've known
him to be always.

38:52.208 --> 38:53.833
- How do I trust you?

38:53.875 --> 38:55.667
- I screwed up,
and I screwed up big time.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.125
- I'm sorry, but Christmas came
very f***ing early this year

38:58.167 --> 38:59.500
because this is
the best Goddamn present

38:59.500 --> 39:01.167
I think I've ever
gotten in my life.

39:01.167 --> 39:03.958
Wrapped up with a bow,
Jax's f***ing ass in jail.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.208
Thank you very much.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.208
Thank you, Santa Claus.

39:07.208 --> 39:09.208
I guess the last thing
there is for Jax to do

39:09.208 --> 39:10.542
is to move to Canada,

39:10.542 --> 39:13.500
start his life over again
for the third time,

39:13.542 --> 39:17.292
and, you know, best of luck
over there, buddy.

39:17.333 --> 39:18.375
Have fun in Canada.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.958
Say "Hi" to Sarah Palin
for me, mate.

39:22.250 --> 39:23.542
- Find his belly button.

39:23.542 --> 39:25.167
- I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

39:25.208 --> 39:27.875
- Oh, God. Just tell me,
is it lower, higher?

39:27.875 --> 39:31.333
Just squeeze like that,
doesn't it?

39:51.625 --> 39:53.333
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:53.375 --> 39:57.000
- Okay.
Hello, all of you.

39:57.042 --> 39:59.375
- Hi, Lisa.
- Thank you for coming.

39:59.417 --> 40:03.750
- Bina's here to teach you
some first aid and CPR.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.208
At some point,
when you work in a restaurant,

40:06.250 --> 40:08.417
unfortunately, somebody
starts to choke,

40:08.417 --> 40:10.875
and if somebody there knows
what they're doing,

40:10.917 --> 40:12.083
you can save a life.

40:12.083 --> 40:13.708
Please pay attention.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.250
This is serious.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.375
- I need two volunteers.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.417
We're gonna practice
mouth-to-mouth on the floor,

40:19.458 --> 40:20.917
and you're gonna practice
on each other,

40:20.917 --> 40:22.583
so I just need
two people for that.

40:22.583 --> 40:24.542
Can we have you come
and help us please?

40:24.583 --> 40:26.292
- Oh, my God, okay.
- Do you want to help us?

40:26.292 --> 40:27.292
- Me?
- Yes, please.

40:27.292 --> 40:28.583
- To lay on the floor?
- Yeah.

40:28.625 --> 40:30.458
- No, I can't.
I just got Botox.

40:30.458 --> 40:32.625
I have to stay upright
for three hours, I'm not--

40:32.667 --> 40:34.792
- Oh, please.
- No, I'm not doing it, sorry.

40:34.792 --> 40:35.958
Doctor's orders,

40:36.000 --> 40:37.917
and you can all make fun of me,
l don't care.

40:37.958 --> 40:39.625
I'm not doing it.
I'm sorry.

40:39.625 --> 40:42.208
- That is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard.

40:42.250 --> 40:43.625
- Sorry, it's the truth.

40:43.625 --> 40:46.125
- She's dying, for God's sake.
- I'm dying.

40:46.125 --> 40:48.542
- Sorry, I'd love to save you,
but I have Botox.

40:48.583 --> 40:50.458
I can't.
- I'm dying.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.792
- Clearly my forehead
doesn't move.

40:52.792 --> 40:54.417
That's called Botox.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.417
- Okay,
so let's have someone else.

40:56.458 --> 40:58.083
- Why don't we have Faith out?

40:58.125 --> 41:00.625
- So you're gonna save Ariana.

41:00.667 --> 41:03.625
Show me positioning
for mouth-to-mouth.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.958
- It's a mouth condom.

41:11.375 --> 41:13.667
- For your compressions,
you're gonna place

41:13.667 --> 41:15.500
the heel of your hand
right on the sternum

41:15.542 --> 41:17.125
just between the nipples.

41:17.167 --> 41:18.667
Now you're gonna keep
your elbows locked

41:18.667 --> 41:20.833
and shoulders squared
directly above.

41:20.833 --> 41:22.500
- I don't think that's right.
- I mean, come on.

41:22.542 --> 41:24.000
We can't do this.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.667
- Come on the side of her.

41:26.667 --> 41:28.833
- From the looks of this,
if Ariana comes back to life,

41:28.875 --> 41:30.333
she's gonna have an orgasm.

41:30.333 --> 41:32.958
- So we need two more volunteers
to do the choking.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.333
So let's have you back there,
and we'll have you do it also.

41:36.375 --> 41:37.458
- Come on, darling.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.792
Let's go, darling.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.833
- So go ahead and be the victim.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.167
- Okay.
- Now you're gonna go ahead

41:43.167 --> 41:44.917
and find her belly button
from the front. Good.

41:44.958 --> 41:46.500
- I think he knows where it is.

41:46.542 --> 41:47.667
- He does not.
- Thanks, Lisa.

41:47.667 --> 41:49.333
- Well, he knows where that is.

41:49.375 --> 41:52.375
Another hole, no, though.
- And then--

41:52.417 --> 41:53.792
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

41:53.833 --> 41:55.667
Save my life.

41:55.708 --> 41:58.500
James with me is like a kid
in a candy store,

41:58.542 --> 42:00.375
but, like, when
I see the kid running,

42:00.375 --> 42:02.875
I, like, put the closed sign up.

42:02.917 --> 42:04.667
My goodies are on lock.

42:04.708 --> 42:06.542
- Now push in
and up towards you.

42:06.542 --> 42:08.292
- Ow! All right, we got it.
It's out.

42:08.333 --> 42:11.875
- Hey, Jax, get up here.
Let's have a go at you.

42:11.875 --> 42:13.458
- He gets up real quick.
He gets up real quick.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.208
- We're doing this?
Okay, okay.

42:16.250 --> 42:18.125
- Just depending
on the person's size,

42:18.167 --> 42:20.958
you're gonna have to adjust
the strength of it, obviously.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.458
So she's gonna go ahead
and find his belly button.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.667
- Oh, I can't do this.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.458
- I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.708
- Oh, God.
Okay, where is it?

42:28.708 --> 42:30.375
- This is exciting.
- All right, feel free.

42:30.375 --> 42:32.750
- Just tell me,
is it lower or higher?

42:32.750 --> 42:34.917
Where is it?
- It's right here.

42:34.917 --> 42:36.250
- Oh, my God,
I cannot believe

42:36.292 --> 42:39.042
you were ever, ever born
and connected to somebody.

42:39.083 --> 42:40.500
- Ken, where are you?
This is love, this is love.

42:40.542 --> 42:42.083
- So you're gonna place

42:42.125 --> 42:43.583
the heel of your hand,
place it on his belly button,

42:43.625 --> 42:45.083
- Watch that ring--there,
right there, there you go.

42:45.125 --> 42:47.917
- It really has
to be like that, doesn't it?

42:47.917 --> 42:49.500
As hard as that, isn't it?

42:49.542 --> 42:51.542
