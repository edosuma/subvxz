WEBVTT

00:01.389 --> 00:02.323
Detective Williams,

00:02.348 --> 00:04.149
this is Special Agent Callen.

00:04.150 --> 00:06.401
Are you telling me
Comescu is in Hawaii?

00:06.403 --> 00:07.285
We found his prints

00:07.287 --> 00:08.603
<i>at a murder scene.</i>

00:08.605 --> 00:10.288
<i>He may have gotten his hands</i>
<i>on a smallpox virus.</i>

00:10.290 --> 00:11.957
We're on our way.

00:11.959 --> 00:14.209
Dracul is not an idealogue.

00:14.211 --> 00:16.444
Our guess is
that he found a buyer

00:16.446 --> 00:17.829
looking for a biological weapon.

00:17.831 --> 00:19.080
DANNY:
What the hell is this?

00:19.082 --> 00:20.782
CHIN: <i>Looks like</i>
<i>a quarantine station.</i>

00:20.784 --> 00:23.335
We did find smallpox virus
samples but not all of them.

00:23.337 --> 00:25.670
Apparently several
vials are missing.

00:26.472 --> 00:27.889
KONO:
<i>The vials you recovered</i>

00:27.891 --> 00:30.725
<i>from Comescu</i>
<i>did not contain smallpox.</i>

00:30.727 --> 00:31.927
It wasn't us,
I swear to you.

00:31.929 --> 00:33.628
- The doctor was gone.
- What doctor?

00:33.630 --> 00:34.846
Jarrod Prodeman--

00:34.848 --> 00:36.765
he's a formerly
highly respected epidemiologist.

00:36.767 --> 00:40.485
Our suspect is on the mainland
with nine vials of smallpox.

00:40.487 --> 00:43.254
I need Hetty to send a team
to LAX right now.

00:48.444 --> 00:50.311
(jet engines whooshing,
cabin alert chiming)

00:50.313 --> 00:52.647
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, as we begin</i>

00:52.649 --> 00:54.482
<i>our descent, please make sure</i>
<i>your seat backs and tray tables</i>

00:54.484 --> 00:56.668
<i>are in their full</i>
<i>upright position.</i>

00:56.670 --> 00:58.336
Your seat belt should
be securely fastened

00:58.338 --> 00:59.704
and all carry-on luggage
should be stowed

00:59.706 --> 01:01.256
underneath the seat
in front of you

01:01.258 --> 01:03.491
or in the overhead bins.

01:03.493 --> 01:05.593
Please turn off all
electronic devices

01:05.595 --> 01:06.878
until we are safely parked
at the gate.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.097
Thank you.

01:13.269 --> 01:15.437
Excuse me,
we're on final approach.

01:15.439 --> 01:17.689
You need to take your seat
and buckle in.

01:19.525 --> 01:20.508
(knocking)

01:20.510 --> 01:22.827
Hello, can
you hear me?

01:24.013 --> 01:26.715
The other passengers say
she's been in there for a while.

01:26.717 --> 01:29.150
Hang on, I'll get the key.

01:37.359 --> 01:39.160
(quiet gasp)

01:41.530 --> 01:43.031
Oh, my God.

02:06.154 --> 02:07.404
Suspect's name
is Jarrod Prodeman.

02:07.906 --> 02:09.239
He's traveling
from Hawaii to Los Angeles

02:09.241 --> 02:12.191
on board Hanalei Air flight 792.

02:12.193 --> 02:14.577
He switched boarding passes with
a man named Benjamin Gallagher

02:14.579 --> 02:17.547
in order to travel with an
unidentified female companion.

02:17.549 --> 02:20.884
He could be carrying
a biochemical weapon, and so...

02:20.886 --> 02:23.336
How long ago?

02:23.338 --> 02:24.587
Damn it.
What is going on

02:24.589 --> 02:26.890
with this equipment?
Problem?

02:26.892 --> 02:27.891
Yeah, I'm trying
to contact Callen,

02:27.893 --> 02:29.092
but the communication
keeps freezing

02:29.094 --> 02:30.727
and nothing I do seems to help.

02:30.729 --> 02:31.761
Okay, let me take a look.

02:31.763 --> 02:32.896
We don't have time for this.

02:32.898 --> 02:34.013
You're right,

02:34.015 --> 02:35.398
but we also don't have
time to make mistakes,

02:35.400 --> 02:37.150
so let's just take a step back.

02:37.152 --> 02:39.886
- Okay?
- Okay.

02:42.689 --> 02:44.056
Try it now.

02:44.058 --> 02:46.942
Callen? Callen,
can you hear me?

02:46.944 --> 02:49.028
See?

02:49.030 --> 02:50.229
What about you?

02:50.231 --> 02:51.897
Did you get in touch
with the flight crew?

02:51.899 --> 02:53.866
No, the plane already landed.

02:53.868 --> 02:55.234
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry.

02:55.236 --> 02:56.869
Kensi and Deeks
are at the airport.

02:56.871 --> 02:58.237
This is a disaster.

02:58.239 --> 03:00.039
I can't believe the one time
we want a flight delayed,

03:00.041 --> 03:01.624
the freaking thing's on time.

03:01.626 --> 03:03.092
- Try it again.
- Callen?

03:03.094 --> 03:06.011
Sam? Does anybody copy?

03:06.013 --> 03:07.012
(sighs)

03:07.014 --> 03:08.247
Come on!

03:08.249 --> 03:09.532
Really?

03:11.718 --> 03:13.753
NELL:
Oh, shoot, it worked.

03:13.755 --> 03:15.271
You need to do it again.

03:15.273 --> 03:17.690
Don't tell Hetty.

03:17.692 --> 03:18.707
Mm-hmm.

03:20.427 --> 03:22.445
Pilot says he's going
to shake the rivets loose

03:22.447 --> 03:23.612
if he pushes any harder.

03:23.614 --> 03:26.315
Well, that's why they
invented parachutes.

03:26.317 --> 03:28.617
Uh, the civilians on board
prefer to land in one piece

03:28.619 --> 03:29.952
if that's okay with you.

03:29.954 --> 03:31.704
You've never jumped
out of a plane?

03:31.706 --> 03:33.706
No, I've never jumped
out of a plane on purpose.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.941
I've also never been involved
in a blood feud either, so...

03:35.943 --> 03:36.959
CHIN:
Well...

03:36.961 --> 03:38.577
unless you count
your mother-in-law.

03:38.579 --> 03:40.212
How does that even
happen, anyway?

03:40.214 --> 03:41.547
It's a Romani thing.

03:41.549 --> 03:43.416
You're a Gypsy?
NELL (distorted): Callen.

03:43.418 --> 03:44.934
Callen.

03:44.936 --> 03:47.119
Uh, we're here, Nell,
can you hear us?

03:47.121 --> 03:48.754
Yeah, copy that.

03:48.756 --> 03:51.140
Okay, we've got audio
and video back up.

03:51.142 --> 03:52.842
Sam and I are with Detective
Lieutenant Kelly

03:52.844 --> 03:55.060
and Detective Sergeant Williams
from the Five-O Task Force.

03:55.062 --> 03:57.313
We're heading back to
L.A. as fast as possible.

03:57.315 --> 03:58.731
Did they secure the plane?

03:58.733 --> 04:01.633
Uh, Kensi and Deeks are at the
airport with the authorities.

04:01.635 --> 04:04.236
We tried to contact the pilot
before they landed but couldn't.

04:04.238 --> 04:06.322
Is the plane secured, yes or no?

04:06.324 --> 04:09.492
No.

04:12.312 --> 04:14.497
Okay, okay.

04:14.499 --> 04:16.148
You know, uh,
I've really been looking forward

04:16.149 --> 04:17.416
to getting back to the mainland

04:17.418 --> 04:18.701
but not under these
circumstances.

04:18.702 --> 04:20.119
KENSI:
<i>Move!</i>

04:20.120 --> 04:22.004
Get out of the way!

04:22.005 --> 04:24.840
Watch it! Move! Move!

04:26.626 --> 04:29.044
Is this Hanalei Flight 792?
Yes.

04:29.046 --> 04:30.763
You have to keep the
passengers onboard.

04:30.765 --> 04:31.797
But they've already deplaned.

04:31.799 --> 04:33.466
Is this about the passenger
who died?

04:33.468 --> 04:35.100
The passenger that--
wait, what happened?

04:35.102 --> 04:36.352
Well, there was a death
on the flight.

04:36.354 --> 04:37.720
Uh, they waited to
remove the body

04:37.722 --> 04:39.138
until the rest of the
passengers were off.

04:39.140 --> 04:40.806
We need to see that body
right now.

04:42.476 --> 04:43.726
Okay.

04:44.778 --> 04:46.812
NCIS.
Where's the body?

04:46.814 --> 04:48.697
WOMAN: We're still waiting
for the coroner.

04:48.699 --> 04:50.533
We have no idea
what happened to her.

04:53.403 --> 04:54.537
That's not Prodeman.

04:54.539 --> 04:55.854
Who is she?

04:55.856 --> 04:57.873
Where are her
personal belongings?

04:57.875 --> 04:59.408
We didn't find anything
left on the plane.

04:59.410 --> 05:01.544
No, the seating chart has
her name as Sharon Walker,

05:01.546 --> 05:03.529
and according to this, she was
traveling with a companion.

05:03.531 --> 05:05.130
Guess who?

05:05.132 --> 05:06.632
- Jarrod Prodeman?
- Bingo.

05:06.634 --> 05:08.133
Hemorrhagic smallpox
could have caused her

05:08.135 --> 05:09.585
to bleed out...
everywhere.

05:09.587 --> 05:10.669
Are we gonna
get sick, too?

05:10.671 --> 05:12.721
There were 230 people
on this plane.

05:12.723 --> 05:14.473
Prolonged face-to-face
exposure

05:14.475 --> 05:16.926
or direct contact with infected
bodily fluids

05:16.928 --> 05:18.394
is required for transmission.

05:18.396 --> 05:19.895
The Health Department's
gonna do a follow-up

05:19.897 --> 05:20.980
with everybody on the plane.

05:20.982 --> 05:22.565
Okay, Eric, I'm sending
you a photo.

05:22.567 --> 05:24.733
Jarrod Prodeman was
traveling with someone.

05:24.735 --> 05:26.101
Want to head him off
at baggage claim?

05:26.103 --> 05:28.687
Do not let anybody else
come in contact with the body.

05:30.723 --> 05:33.192
The dead woman's name
is Sharon Walker.

05:33.194 --> 05:34.743
According to airline records,

05:34.745 --> 05:36.495
she was traveling
with a man we think

05:36.497 --> 05:38.280
is carrying the virus--
Jarrod Prodeman.

05:38.282 --> 05:40.533
And so far, I haven't
spotted him in the airport.

05:40.535 --> 05:42.835
And I find nothing that
links these two together,

05:42.837 --> 05:44.453
aside from the fact
that they were staying

05:44.455 --> 05:45.737
in the same hotel in Hawaii.

05:45.739 --> 05:48.507
Maybe Virus Boy made
a love connection.

05:48.509 --> 05:51.544
Or maybe he knew we'd be looking
for a Single White Male

05:51.546 --> 05:53.762
and not a happy
vacationing couple.

05:53.764 --> 05:55.264
HETTY:
I'll update Granger.

05:55.266 --> 05:57.016
KENSI:
<i>Guys, move out of the way!</i>

05:57.018 --> 05:58.384
DEEKS:
<i>Back up, back up, back up!</i>

05:58.386 --> 06:01.353
You guys! Back up!
Back up! Back up!

06:01.355 --> 06:02.805
DEEKS: Back up.
Excuse me, excuse me.

06:02.807 --> 06:04.139
Eric, we got
this place locked down.

06:04.141 --> 06:05.591
Holler out if you've
got eyes on him.

06:05.593 --> 06:07.259
Okay, Jarrod Prodeman,
five-nine,

06:07.261 --> 06:09.595
about 180, brown hair,
brown eyes.

06:09.597 --> 06:10.980
You guys have his photograph.

06:10.982 --> 06:12.114
He may be in disguise.

06:12.116 --> 06:14.266
He may be carrying two sets
of carry-ons,

06:14.268 --> 06:16.068
including a purse.

06:16.070 --> 06:17.620
Do you see him?
Maybe.

06:17.622 --> 06:19.572
Baseball cap, denim jacket.

06:24.711 --> 06:26.945
No, it's not him.
It's not him.

06:26.947 --> 06:28.614
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this.

06:28.616 --> 06:30.332
Eric, do you see him?

06:32.135 --> 06:33.118
Got him.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.119
Where is he?

06:37.123 --> 06:38.340
Eric, where is he?

06:38.342 --> 06:40.643
He left.

06:40.645 --> 06:42.011
What do you mean, he left?

06:42.013 --> 06:43.896
He never went to baggage claim.

06:43.898 --> 06:47.149
He got in a cab and drove off
six minutes ago.

06:48.218 --> 06:50.585
He's gone.

07:13.438 --> 07:15.289
KENSI: Eric and Nell are still
trying to track down the cab.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.107
Do you know that we live
on the only planet

07:17.109 --> 07:18.942
in the known universe
with life on it?

07:20.629 --> 07:23.247
A planet with
a fragile ecosystem;

07:23.249 --> 07:24.965
small, breathable
atmosphere,

07:24.967 --> 07:26.617
all of which could be
wiped out in a second

07:26.619 --> 07:29.470
by a meteorite or
a mega-quake or...

07:29.472 --> 07:30.454
This isn't your B'ak'tun '12

07:30.456 --> 07:32.957
end of the world
apocalypse theories again?

07:32.959 --> 07:35.626
No, I'm just saying,
it's a shame, you know?

07:35.628 --> 07:37.011
We're all alone on this rock,

07:37.013 --> 07:39.063
and yet we're still finding
ways to kill each other.

07:39.065 --> 07:40.631
Oh, don't get
philosophical on me.

07:40.633 --> 07:41.899
It creeps me out.

07:43.134 --> 07:44.435
What's the worst
that can happen, right?

07:44.437 --> 07:47.104
Global pandemic,

07:47.106 --> 07:50.324
wipes out half
the world's population.

07:50.326 --> 07:52.326
Kind of puts things in
perspective, doesn't it?

07:52.328 --> 07:53.861
How's that?

07:53.863 --> 07:55.529
Well, sometimes you don't
know how lucky you are

07:55.531 --> 07:59.433
to have something until you
realize you might lose it.

08:01.486 --> 08:02.653
(Eric whistles)

08:03.421 --> 08:05.656
You guys might
want to see this.

08:11.829 --> 08:13.547
This is a simulation

08:13.549 --> 08:16.267
of the predicted spread
of a smallpox pandemic

08:16.269 --> 08:17.968
beginning in Los Angeles.

08:20.972 --> 08:22.473
Oh, my God.

08:22.475 --> 08:25.008
ERIC: It's a worst-case
scenario.

08:25.010 --> 08:26.527
With containment,

08:26.529 --> 08:28.028
isolation and inoculation,

08:28.030 --> 08:31.181
we can, theoretically,
prevent this.

08:31.183 --> 08:33.067
Did you find the cab yet?

08:33.068 --> 08:36.236
Um, I lost him
in airport traffic,

08:36.239 --> 08:39.022
but, uh, Nell's on the phone
with the cab company

08:39.024 --> 08:41.575
trying to determine where
the driver dropped him off.

08:41.577 --> 08:43.544
And Jarrod Prodeman?

08:43.546 --> 08:45.629
Uh, Jarrod Prodeman.

08:45.631 --> 08:50.251
Jarrod Prodeman was a respected
epidemiologist from Pittsburgh.

08:50.253 --> 08:52.086
Divorced, no kids.

08:52.088 --> 08:55.089
He was disgraced
back in 2007

08:55.091 --> 08:58.375
when it was revealed
he cooked some data

08:58.377 --> 08:59.710
to pump up his research.

08:59.712 --> 09:02.546
Wh-what is this?
Is it revenge?

09:02.548 --> 09:04.098
Maybe.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.766
But who's paying for it?

09:05.768 --> 09:07.518
Not Prodeman.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.019
He's broke.

09:09.021 --> 09:11.221
He's been living in Hawaii for
the last several months,

09:11.223 --> 09:13.390
no apparent means of income.

09:13.392 --> 09:14.408
KENSI:
Okay.

09:14.410 --> 09:15.743
Follow the money trail,

09:15.745 --> 09:17.745
it might lead us to Prodeman
and the virus.

09:17.747 --> 09:19.062
(sighs)

09:24.869 --> 09:26.537
(sighs)

09:28.356 --> 09:30.174
Detective Sergeant
Danny Williams,

09:30.176 --> 09:32.009
Detective Lieutenant
Chin Ho Kelly,

09:32.011 --> 09:32.926
Five-O Task Force.

09:32.928 --> 09:34.428
This is Special Agent
Kensi Blye

09:34.430 --> 09:37.765
and our LAPD liaison,
Detective Marty Deeks.

09:37.767 --> 09:38.599
Hey. How are you?

09:38.601 --> 09:39.633
KENSI: Hi.
Hey.

09:39.635 --> 09:41.135
Nice to finally meet you.

09:41.137 --> 09:43.420
Thank you. Wish it was under
different circumstances.

09:43.422 --> 09:44.938
This place is great.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.223
I feel like
we should be eating nachos

09:46.225 --> 09:47.558
and ordering a pitcher
of margaritas.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.760
Our building is
a fine example

09:49.762 --> 09:53.280
of the Spanish Mission style
of California.

09:53.282 --> 09:56.950
The least we could do is
to preserve its heritage.

09:56.952 --> 10:01.455
After all, first impressions
are so important.

10:01.457 --> 10:04.274
Operations Manager
Hetty Lange,

10:04.276 --> 10:05.376
this is Detective Sergeant...

10:05.378 --> 10:07.444
Oh... Detective
Daniel Williams,

10:07.446 --> 10:09.880
and Detective Chin Ho Kelly.

10:09.882 --> 10:13.467
I appreciate your being here
to help us out, gentlemen.

10:13.469 --> 10:15.336
Well, there's too much at stake
for us not to see this through.

10:15.338 --> 10:16.670
HETTY:
Agreed.

10:16.672 --> 10:20.090
You're the first outsiders
to ever step foot

10:20.092 --> 10:21.892
in this operations center.

10:21.894 --> 10:25.396
It shows you the
severity of the situation.

10:25.398 --> 10:28.315
Well, I appreciate you
not blindfolding us.

10:28.317 --> 10:29.966
(wry laugh)

10:31.469 --> 10:33.354
Right. The good news is
we were able to detain

10:33.356 --> 10:34.938
most of the passengers
at baggage claim,

10:34.940 --> 10:36.273
along with the flight crew.

10:36.275 --> 10:38.442
The Health Department's
looking over them now.

10:38.444 --> 10:39.576
Any leads on Prodeman?

10:39.578 --> 10:41.245
Eric's still trying
to track him down.

10:41.247 --> 10:42.813
HETTY:
Well, um...

10:42.815 --> 10:45.582
perhaps you and Mr. Deeks could,
uh, brief our guests.

10:45.584 --> 10:47.618
I need to speak
with the two of you.

10:47.620 --> 10:48.819
KENSI:
Okay.

10:48.821 --> 10:50.987
This way.

10:52.323 --> 10:53.624
She, uh, come with the building?

10:53.626 --> 10:55.509
Easy, tiger.
She's got ears like a bat.

10:55.511 --> 10:57.044
Really? She sleep
upside-down, too?

10:57.046 --> 10:58.379
Okay, I'll be over here.

10:58.381 --> 10:59.880
Okay.

10:59.882 --> 11:03.934
We are up to our asses
in alligators on this one,

11:03.936 --> 11:05.969
gentlemen.
You know what

11:05.971 --> 11:08.389
will happen when the media gets
ahold of this.

11:08.391 --> 11:10.190
All hell's going to break loose.

11:10.192 --> 11:13.143
It's gonna make hell
look organized.

11:13.145 --> 11:15.946
Misinformation and confusion
will lead to panic.

11:15.948 --> 11:19.400
Fear will lead to a mass exodus,
traffic jams, rioting, looting.

11:19.402 --> 11:20.784
Market will drop,

11:20.786 --> 11:23.854
America will become a pariah,
even to its allies.

11:23.856 --> 11:26.290
Fundamentalists will think
it's an act of God.

11:26.292 --> 11:27.975
It'll be a cluster...
Bomb.

11:28.910 --> 11:30.193
At some point,
you're going to have

11:30.195 --> 11:31.829
to alert the public
for their own safety.

11:31.831 --> 11:35.582
Unfortunately, yes.

11:35.584 --> 11:39.386
But until then, you've been
granted plenary power

11:39.388 --> 11:44.591
to do whatever it takes
to stop this here and now.

11:52.150 --> 11:54.017
KENSI:
Okay, thank you. Bye.

11:54.019 --> 11:56.353
So, the taxi company told Nell

11:56.355 --> 11:58.355
that a man matching
Preman's description

11:58.357 --> 12:01.658
paid in cash and was dropped off
at the Seaward Hotel in Venice.

12:01.660 --> 12:03.560
We also have an address
for Sharon Walker.

12:03.562 --> 12:06.029
Excellent.
But Detectives Deeks,

12:06.031 --> 12:07.865
Williams and Kelly need
a smallpox

12:07.867 --> 12:10.048
inoculation before
we can go any further.

12:10.073 --> 12:11.235
DEEKS:
Wh-why...

12:11.236 --> 12:12.503
why-why just us?

12:12.505 --> 12:15.205
'Cause everybody else
already had the vaccine.

12:16.624 --> 12:18.258
DEEKS: Isn't there some sort
of pill we can take?

12:18.260 --> 12:19.376
How about a patch?

12:19.378 --> 12:20.961
Maybe some nasal spray?

12:20.963 --> 12:22.078
No.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.297
I'm not a...

12:23.299 --> 12:25.081
not a <i>huge</i> fan of needles.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.266
Oh, well.

12:26.268 --> 12:27.384
Guests, uh...

12:27.386 --> 12:29.085
You should probably go
to the guests first.

12:29.087 --> 12:30.521
You should go first.

12:30.523 --> 12:32.139
No, uh, I, uh... You go ahead.

12:32.141 --> 12:33.807
I got to work
on my... sleeve here.

12:33.809 --> 12:35.025
Ten bucks says
one of 'em goes down.

12:35.027 --> 12:36.393
CHIN:
Come on, boys.

12:36.395 --> 12:37.260
Man up.

12:37.262 --> 12:38.595
Come on, Deeks.

12:38.597 --> 12:40.230
I'll buy you ice cream
if you don't cry.

12:40.232 --> 12:41.765
(clears throat)
I don't want any ice cream.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.734
Hmm, hmm...

12:43.736 --> 12:46.453
Really?

12:53.745 --> 12:56.630
That's it.

12:56.632 --> 12:58.966
So, you might feel a...

12:58.968 --> 13:00.884
tiny little prick.

13:00.886 --> 13:03.637
I'm sorry, wait,
I may feel a little what?

13:03.639 --> 13:05.472
It's probably not
his first time.

13:05.474 --> 13:06.924
(Deeks screams)

13:06.926 --> 13:07.975
(body thuds)

13:07.977 --> 13:09.459
DANNY:
<i>Man down.</i>

13:18.403 --> 13:20.737
Would you stop
scratching it?

13:20.739 --> 13:22.305
It burns.
Did you see her?

13:22.307 --> 13:25.475
She stabbed me like she
was fending off a bear attack.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.078
How's your head doing?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.479
It's fine.

13:29.481 --> 13:31.665
What?

13:31.667 --> 13:33.650
I didn't pass out, I tripped.

13:33.652 --> 13:34.785
You dropped like a rock.

13:34.787 --> 13:35.953
Like I tripped
on a rock.pass out, I tripped.

13:35.955 --> 13:37.087
Okay.

13:37.089 --> 13:39.006
Well, don't fall out there,
Stumbles.

13:39.008 --> 13:41.258
You know what?
I find it rather unbecoming

13:41.260 --> 13:43.310
that you laughed at me
in front of the Five-O boys.

13:43.312 --> 13:44.878
It was funny.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.213
I'm glad
that you all bonded

13:46.215 --> 13:47.764
over the hilarity
of my misfortune.

13:47.766 --> 13:49.383
Oh, come on, don't be
such a drama queen.

13:49.385 --> 13:50.717
What about your little
performance back there?

13:50.719 --> 13:51.969
What are you
talking about?

13:51.971 --> 13:53.136
What am I talking about?

13:53.138 --> 13:54.638
The over-the-top laughing,

13:54.640 --> 13:56.273
the hair flip,
the pelvic tilt.

13:56.275 --> 13:58.308
You were throwing out
more flirtation signals

13:58.310 --> 14:00.143
than a divorcée
on a singles' cruise.

14:00.145 --> 14:02.896
Oh, my God, you
have a concussion.

14:02.898 --> 14:04.681
No, what I have is
a partner who freaks out,

14:04.683 --> 14:05.899
turns into a schoolgirl

14:05.901 --> 14:07.150
every time there's cute
new boys hanging around.

14:07.152 --> 14:08.852
Okay, you are a liar.

14:08.854 --> 14:10.871
And, by the way, I find
it very interesting

14:10.873 --> 14:12.155
that you thought that
they were cute.

14:12.157 --> 14:14.190
Got a little island
fever going on? Huh?

14:14.192 --> 14:16.293
You know what, tell me,
tell me that you didn't do this.

14:16.295 --> 14:18.245
(giggling):
Danno.

14:18.247 --> 14:19.496
Adjust my ponytail?
Uh-huh.

14:19.498 --> 14:20.581
You adjusted your ponytail

14:20.583 --> 14:22.215
so you could present
your armpits.

14:22.217 --> 14:24.301
What?

14:24.303 --> 14:26.720
The armpit is the center
of pheromone production.

14:26.722 --> 14:29.205
You are certifiably insane.

14:29.207 --> 14:31.258
I'm not the one presenting
my scent glands to everybody.

14:31.260 --> 14:33.209
I'm glad you didn't because the
only thing that you give off

14:33.211 --> 14:34.478
is repellent.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.812
Oh, you know what?
You love my scent.

14:35.814 --> 14:37.364
In fact you probably sleep
with one of my old T-shirts.

14:37.366 --> 14:38.548
I am missing one,
actually.

14:38.550 --> 14:40.550
That's because it crawled
out of your gym bag,

14:40.552 --> 14:42.552
and I shot it to put
it out of its misery.

14:42.554 --> 14:43.737
(chuckles)

14:43.739 --> 14:46.239
Oh, and, um, for the record...

14:47.909 --> 14:50.077
...I don't sleep
with anything on.

14:51.412 --> 14:54.247
Unless it's a costume.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.900
(inhales deeply)

14:56.902 --> 14:58.418
That was uncalled for.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.020
(knocking on door)

15:04.876 --> 15:06.209
Can I help you?

15:06.211 --> 15:08.929
Yeah. I'm Special
Agent Blye, NCIS.

15:08.931 --> 15:11.515
This is Detective
Deeks, LAPD.

15:11.517 --> 15:13.183
Is this the home
of Sharon Walker?

15:13.185 --> 15:14.968
Yes. Why?

15:14.970 --> 15:16.720
Is my sister okay?

15:16.722 --> 15:18.472
You're Sharon Walker's sister?

15:18.474 --> 15:21.024
Carol. Yes, she's my twin.

15:22.110 --> 15:24.061
Perhaps it would be better
if we came inside to talk.

15:24.063 --> 15:25.646
Perhaps it would be better
if you told me

15:25.648 --> 15:27.464
what the hell's going on.

15:29.233 --> 15:31.118
I'm afraid we have
some bad news.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.986
What sort of bad news?

15:32.988 --> 15:34.655
About your sister, Sharon.

15:34.657 --> 15:35.939
Look, Sharon's
on her way

15:35.941 --> 15:38.075
back from Hawaii-- she's going
to be here any minute.

15:38.077 --> 15:41.294
I'm sorry, but your sister
passed away on the flight home.

15:50.588 --> 15:52.222
Maybe you should slow down.

15:52.224 --> 15:53.790
Maybe you should
remember our rule

15:53.792 --> 15:55.258
about not criticizing
each other's driving.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.760
I'm not criticizing.

15:56.762 --> 15:58.178
I just don't want you to lose
the Five-O guys.

15:58.180 --> 16:00.847
If they can tail a suspect,
I'm sure they can follow me.

16:00.849 --> 16:02.099
They live on an island.

16:02.101 --> 16:04.317
They're cops,

16:04.319 --> 16:06.903
not the Skipper
and Gilligan.

16:08.072 --> 16:11.608
Maybe you and I should retire
to a nice warm island.

16:11.610 --> 16:13.076
What about my family?

16:13.078 --> 16:14.027
Oh, you could bring them.

16:14.029 --> 16:15.912
(chuckles)
Gee, thanks.

16:15.914 --> 16:17.581
No, I mean it.

16:17.583 --> 16:19.082
After this is all over,

16:19.084 --> 16:22.986
we ought to settle down
somewhere nice and quiet.

16:22.988 --> 16:25.789
Do some fishing,
some golfing,

16:25.791 --> 16:28.291
build things.

16:28.293 --> 16:29.659
What kind of things?

16:29.661 --> 16:30.761
I don't know.

16:30.763 --> 16:32.162
Whatever guys build
when they retire.

16:32.164 --> 16:34.347
You know, like hobby stuff.

16:34.349 --> 16:35.682
Hobby stuff?

16:35.684 --> 16:37.500
Yeah.

16:37.502 --> 16:38.719
You don't fish,
and you don't golf.

16:38.721 --> 16:39.836
I'm not retired.

16:39.838 --> 16:41.188
You don't have
any hobbies.

16:41.190 --> 16:44.641
The only way a guy like you
would retire is with a bullet.

16:44.643 --> 16:46.810
Nice.
Wh...

16:46.812 --> 16:49.229
Thanks.
What I meant to say...

16:49.231 --> 16:50.614
What I meant to
say was that

16:50.616 --> 16:52.482
I can't see you giving
this up. All right?

16:52.484 --> 16:53.900
Then say that, okay?

16:53.902 --> 16:56.653
Don't jinx me by saying
that I'm gonna to get...

16:56.655 --> 16:58.188
you know what.

16:58.190 --> 16:59.522
Okay.

16:59.524 --> 17:01.357
I've been, "you know what"
several times.

17:01.359 --> 17:02.542
I know.

17:02.544 --> 17:04.359
I'm already pressing my luck.

17:04.362 --> 17:05.878
You know what I'm doing
after we get this guy?

17:05.881 --> 17:07.030
What's that?

17:07.031 --> 17:08.131
I'm getting a hobby.

17:08.133 --> 17:11.550
Maybe you should start
scrapbooking our cases.

17:27.151 --> 17:28.735
CALLEN: <i>Eric.</i>
ERIC: <i>Yo.</i>

17:28.737 --> 17:30.403
Yeah, I need you to track
Prodeman's movements

17:30.405 --> 17:31.721
after he arrived
at to the hotel.

17:31.723 --> 17:34.407
I'm on it, but it's not going
to be easy, G.

17:34.409 --> 17:36.243
I know, just do your best.

17:36.245 --> 17:37.577
Will do.

17:37.579 --> 17:39.913
Sharon Walker's carry-on and
purse were in the closet,

17:39.915 --> 17:42.165
but Hazmat didn't find
any signs of the virus.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.451
Room safe was empty, too.

17:44.453 --> 17:45.952
You think he's in the wind?

17:45.954 --> 17:48.922
I think Sharon Walker's death
wasn't part of the plan,

17:48.924 --> 17:51.041
which means he may be
improvising.

17:51.043 --> 17:53.076
Great, he's more likely
to make a mistake that way.

17:53.078 --> 17:54.744
Makes him more dangerous, too.

17:54.746 --> 17:56.179
If we don't find this guy fast,

17:56.181 --> 17:58.081
we may want to head back
to Hawaii.

18:01.135 --> 18:02.969
CHIN: So, the manager says Prodeman
hasn't had any incoming

18:02.971 --> 18:05.021
or outgoing phone calls
or any visitors.

18:05.023 --> 18:06.589
The room's only rented
for a night.

18:06.591 --> 18:08.308
He hasn't been here long enough
for any of the guests or staff

18:08.310 --> 18:10.060
to have really gotten
a good look at him.

18:10.062 --> 18:11.278
Did you try the locals?

18:11.280 --> 18:13.079
Yeah, not so helpful, although
I did speak to a woman

18:13.081 --> 18:15.782
who said she saw Jesus fishing
off the pier yesterday.

18:16.868 --> 18:18.368
She say what he was using
for bait?

18:18.370 --> 18:20.537
No. Los Angeles-- where
the crazy come to vacation.

18:20.539 --> 18:21.938
CHIN:
I kind of like it.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.373
It's like being at the circus.

18:23.375 --> 18:24.407
You may not want
to be down here

18:24.409 --> 18:26.459
during the full moon though.

18:27.295 --> 18:29.379
You know, maybe we missed him.

18:30.214 --> 18:33.133
Maybe not.

18:35.970 --> 18:37.554
Is that him?

18:43.761 --> 18:45.461
I'd call that a yes.
Federal agents!

18:57.641 --> 18:59.326
(grunts)

18:59.328 --> 19:02.762
(panting)

19:03.397 --> 19:05.081
(cries out)

19:05.083 --> 19:07.300
Think that hurt
as bad as it looked?

19:07.302 --> 19:09.586
Yeah, that's going
to leave a mark.

19:23.382 --> 19:25.350
I want a lawyer.

19:26.923 --> 19:29.241
What do you think, Sam?

19:31.044 --> 19:35.264
I think... if I was him...

19:35.266 --> 19:36.766
I'd want to be the one
in the courtroom

19:36.768 --> 19:38.634
who tried to stop
a deadly pandemic,

19:38.636 --> 19:41.354
not the one who helped kill
millions of people.

19:41.356 --> 19:43.522
I didn't know
that it was smallpox.

19:43.524 --> 19:47.059
Okay? I thought we were pirating
someone's drug research.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.528
So how do you explain the death
of Sharon Walker?

19:50.364 --> 19:52.281
Sharon had cancer.

19:52.283 --> 19:55.735
Okay? She was in Hawaii
celebrating a remission.

19:55.737 --> 19:58.487
She must have relapsed
or something.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.956
Why'd you steal
her personal belongings?

20:01.825 --> 20:03.876
I panicked.

20:03.878 --> 20:06.045
Okay? I panicked.

20:06.047 --> 20:08.080
I didn't want to stick around
and answer questions.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.716
I was going to give them to her
family first chance I got.

20:14.954 --> 20:18.174
Nice try.

20:21.311 --> 20:22.561
PRODEMAN (recording):
Patient beta developed

20:22.563 --> 20:24.897
flu-like symptoms
20 hours ago.

20:24.899 --> 20:27.566
Temperature of 38.5 degrees
Celsius.

20:27.568 --> 20:29.351
Eight hours later,
a rash emerged on the tongue

20:29.353 --> 20:30.686
and in the mouth.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.521
I expect a pustular
rash period

20:32.523 --> 20:34.990
to begin within the next ten
or 12 hours.

20:34.992 --> 20:37.359
Your voice was matched
to those experiments

20:37.361 --> 20:39.695
you performed on the
people in Hawaii.

20:39.697 --> 20:43.249
Combine those
with Sharon Walker...

20:43.251 --> 20:46.285
that's five murders
with a class "A" select agent.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.504
That's a Title 18,
Section 2332--

20:48.506 --> 20:51.624
bioterrorist attack
on American citizens.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.175
That's the death penalty.

20:53.177 --> 20:55.461
Times five.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.171
Last chance.

21:07.858 --> 21:09.725
Who was paying you off?

21:09.727 --> 21:12.194
Her name is...

21:12.196 --> 21:14.697
Dr. Rachel Holden.

21:16.783 --> 21:19.034
I hope it was
worth it.

21:21.855 --> 21:23.322
No, monkey, everything is fine.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.659
Okay? I just needed to come here
for a couple days for work.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.244
Look, I gotta go.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.962
Um, I'll call you both
in a little bit.

21:31.715 --> 21:34.800
I just thought that I should
call my daughter.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.837
How's this going?

21:37.839 --> 21:39.805
We just got a name.
Dr. Rachel Holden.

21:39.807 --> 21:41.390
Your guys are already
running it down.

21:41.392 --> 21:42.875
I just hope they're
quick about it.

21:45.479 --> 21:47.580
What about
an abandoned missile silo?

21:47.582 --> 21:49.515
Underground?

21:49.517 --> 21:51.250
Uh, thanks,
but no, thanks.

21:51.252 --> 21:52.485
If I'm going
to be bugging out,

21:52.487 --> 21:55.437
I'm want to be on
a deserted tropical island.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.891
Just me, couple hundred
of my favorite books.

21:58.893 --> 22:01.410
I have excellent
tropical survival skills.

22:01.412 --> 22:04.330
Just putting it out there,
for the record.

22:04.332 --> 22:07.867
Okay, there are tons of Dr.
Rachel Holdens in this country--

22:07.869 --> 22:10.169
doctors, dentists,
veterinarians,

22:10.171 --> 22:12.004
not to mention
those with PhDs.

22:12.006 --> 22:13.956
Uhp, I think
I may have found her.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.758
I have a Dr.
Rachel Holden,

22:15.760 --> 22:18.344
she's an epidemiologist
at the Malibu Cancer Institute.

22:20.013 --> 22:21.931
Yeah, just knock my stuff
out of the way.

22:21.933 --> 22:23.549
She doesn't look like
a mad scientist.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.217
You know what they say
about crazy women.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.052
No, I don't.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.437
What do they say?

22:28.439 --> 22:30.055
I don't know.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.441
Uh, but they probably
say something.

22:32.443 --> 22:34.276
I'll alert the others.

22:36.062 --> 22:37.796
CALLEN:
<i>Why was she making it?</i>

22:37.798 --> 22:38.764
I don't know.

22:38.766 --> 22:39.949
Who was paying her?

22:39.951 --> 22:42.201
I don't know.

22:42.203 --> 22:44.036
Okay, I brought it here.

22:44.038 --> 22:46.038
She met me at the hotel
and paid me.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.823
That was the end of it for me.

22:47.825 --> 22:48.908
She had to have a buyer.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.226
She never told me who.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.833
CALLEN: Smallpox is a weapon
of mass destruction...

22:57.835 --> 22:59.802
DANNY: I know, Monkey,
I miss you, too.

22:59.804 --> 23:01.921
But I'll see you
in a couple days, okay?

23:01.923 --> 23:03.956
All right, I
love you too.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.424
Bye, Monkey.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.009
CHIN: None of
the victims in Hawaii

23:07.011 --> 23:09.979
have any connections to L.A.
or to Jarrod Prodeman.

23:09.981 --> 23:11.797
This doesn't make any sense.
We must be missing something.

23:11.799 --> 23:14.299
Yeah. Besides a couple nights
of sleep?

23:14.301 --> 23:15.901
Right.
DANNY: I'm really hungry.

23:15.903 --> 23:19.405
Is there anything to eat in
this secret hideout of yours?

23:19.407 --> 23:21.139
There's a taco truck
around the corner,

23:21.141 --> 23:22.942
if you want to grab a pencil,
start taking orders.

23:22.944 --> 23:23.909
Wow.

23:23.911 --> 23:24.944
I was under the impression

23:24.946 --> 23:26.161
that Hetty packed your lunch.

23:26.163 --> 23:28.080
(chuckles): Oh, Hetty packs my--
That's funny.

23:28.082 --> 23:29.365
This guy, he's funny.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.500
I hope that my witty banter
isn't this annoying.

23:31.502 --> 23:32.768
Whoever said you were witty?

23:33.486 --> 23:34.653
Oh, touché.

23:34.655 --> 23:37.172
That's it?
You're out?

23:37.174 --> 23:38.841
- I'm out.
- Wow.

23:38.843 --> 23:41.110
So did McGarrett ever find out
what Shelburne meant?

23:42.545 --> 23:44.997
Yeah, he thought he did,
but, uh...

23:44.999 --> 23:46.331
But?

23:46.333 --> 23:48.934
But he's still
looking for answers.

23:50.136 --> 23:52.187
Can I help you with something?

23:52.189 --> 23:54.340
Just thinking about your hair.

23:55.275 --> 23:56.675
Is it bulletproof?

23:56.677 --> 23:57.610
(laughs):
That's good.

23:57.612 --> 23:59.344
I mean, you got,
you got a haircut

23:59.346 --> 24:00.512
like my neighbor's
Schnauzer,

24:00.514 --> 24:01.814
and you're talking
to me about grooming.

24:01.816 --> 24:02.993
- This-- style by pillow.
- Yeah.

24:02.994 --> 24:03.993
I don't know what that means.

24:03.995 --> 24:05.211
It's a lot less hair spray.

24:05.213 --> 24:06.212
Ah.

24:06.214 --> 24:07.496
(laughs):
That's good.

24:07.498 --> 24:08.998
Just warming you up
for the A game.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.716
The A game? All right.
Yeah.

24:10.718 --> 24:12.301
Well, I'll be careful; I don't
want you to hurt yourself.

24:12.303 --> 24:13.719
- Please get that.
- Yeah.

24:13.721 --> 24:14.837
Sorry to interrupt you,

24:14.839 --> 24:16.505
but we have an address
for Dr. Rachel Holden.

24:16.507 --> 24:17.690
Thank God.

24:20.227 --> 24:23.012
Uh... don't, uh...

24:23.014 --> 24:24.146
don't break anything, yeah?

24:24.148 --> 24:25.665
All right.

24:27.184 --> 24:28.351
Okay, thanks, guys.

24:28.353 --> 24:30.552
So, Dr. Rachel Holden is
supposedly on sabbatical,

24:30.554 --> 24:32.905
except for the fact her house
has been foreclosed on

24:32.907 --> 24:34.156
and her car was repossessed.

24:34.158 --> 24:35.825
Sounds like someone
going into hiding.

24:35.827 --> 24:37.660
Or someone fleeing the country.

24:37.662 --> 24:39.111
So Eric and Nell
requested access

24:39.113 --> 24:40.729
to her files and to her office,

24:40.731 --> 24:44.083
but the hospital is
refusing further cooperation

24:44.085 --> 24:45.668
until they talk to
their legal council.

24:45.670 --> 24:47.870
Are you kidding me? We
don't have time for this.

24:47.872 --> 24:50.456
Which is why you and I
will be playing doctor.

24:50.458 --> 24:51.874
Well, actually,
that's not true.

24:51.876 --> 24:53.843
I'll be playing doctor,
and you'll be playing my nurse.

24:53.845 --> 24:55.878
Why? Because you look more like
a doctor than I do?

24:55.880 --> 24:57.763
No, because you look
more like a nurse than I do.

24:57.765 --> 24:59.081
That is really sexist.

24:59.083 --> 25:01.417
You say sexist, I say sexy.

25:01.419 --> 25:04.020
Okay, I am playing the doctor,
you are playing the nurse.

25:04.022 --> 25:05.805
Too late. I
already called it.

25:05.807 --> 25:08.090
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

25:10.593 --> 25:11.593
(clears throat)

25:11.595 --> 25:13.779
Doctor.

25:18.068 --> 25:19.035
(gasps)

25:20.871 --> 25:22.071
Who is this?

25:22.073 --> 25:23.489
This is Murray.

25:23.491 --> 25:24.907
They took out my spleen.

25:24.909 --> 25:26.959
And he was only here
visiting someone.

25:26.961 --> 25:29.111
And what are we gonna do
with Murray?

25:29.113 --> 25:30.946
Murray is our cover.

25:30.948 --> 25:32.498
Are you gonna check me?

25:32.500 --> 25:34.467
Yes, Murray,
she's gonna check you.

25:34.469 --> 25:35.501
No, no.

25:35.503 --> 25:36.585
I'm not.

25:36.587 --> 25:37.953
What is Dr. Holden's
office number?

25:37.955 --> 25:39.472
150-- right up here.

25:39.474 --> 25:40.673
Cover me.

25:40.675 --> 25:42.958
(clears throat)

25:42.960 --> 25:44.760
Now I'm gonna
check you.

25:44.762 --> 25:45.644
Take what's yours, Murray.

25:45.646 --> 25:47.229
Take a deep
breath for me.

25:48.631 --> 25:49.915
One more time.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.769
Excuse me.
Who are you?

25:53.771 --> 25:54.820
What? Who? Who, me?

25:54.822 --> 25:56.021
You don't work here.

25:56.023 --> 25:57.156
Oh, I'm actually, uh...

25:57.158 --> 25:58.491
I'm a private nurse.

25:58.493 --> 26:00.476
I'm Mr. Edelstein's
home health care provider.

26:01.428 --> 26:02.811
My patient pulled
his catheter out again.

26:02.813 --> 26:05.364
I need somebody to hold him down
while I put it back in.

26:05.366 --> 26:06.499
Wow, you're in luck, because

26:06.501 --> 26:07.583
that's actually
Dr. Blye's specialty.

26:07.585 --> 26:08.868
She's a urologist.

26:08.870 --> 26:10.586
Why don't you go help her
with that; I can handle this.

26:10.588 --> 26:11.670
Great, thanks.

26:11.672 --> 26:13.339
(clattering in room)
Oh.

26:13.341 --> 26:14.957
(sighs)

26:14.959 --> 26:17.927
You are so going to
pay for this.

26:17.929 --> 26:19.628
You're the one that wanted
to be the doctor.

26:19.630 --> 26:20.713
I even called it.

26:20.715 --> 26:22.515
See you later. Hey, Murray?

26:23.333 --> 26:24.666
Keep an eye out, yeah?

26:24.668 --> 26:25.718
High-five.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.886
You're awesome.

26:26.888 --> 26:28.938
(door opens, closes)

26:34.010 --> 26:36.178
(typing)

26:42.319 --> 26:46.489
"And the four angels, who had
been prepared for this very hour

26:46.491 --> 26:49.858
"and day and month and year,
were released to kill a third

26:49.860 --> 26:51.710
of mankind..."

26:53.530 --> 26:55.815
Oh, my God.

27:05.704 --> 27:06.671
(Nell sighs)

27:06.673 --> 27:08.973
Why do you keep
running this?

27:08.975 --> 27:11.392
(sighs) When I get
tired or frustrated,

27:11.394 --> 27:13.244
it helps me to
remember the victims.

27:13.246 --> 27:18.048
Their loss pushes
me to keep going.

27:18.050 --> 27:19.650
Try a little harder.

27:19.652 --> 27:21.652
It's so disturbing.

27:21.654 --> 27:24.555
That's why I'm running it down
here instead of up in OPS.

27:25.824 --> 27:29.243
So, uh, did you find anything
else about Dr. Rachel Holden?

27:29.245 --> 27:31.996
Uh, yeah. She hasn't used her
credit card for several weeks,

27:31.998 --> 27:34.749
but two of the last things she
purchased were plane tickets.

27:34.751 --> 27:36.867
One for Jarrod Prodeman
to Amsterdam,

27:36.869 --> 27:40.671
the other for herself, uh--
Taca International Flight 529.

27:40.673 --> 27:42.875
It leaves LAX tomorrow
at 7:42 a.m.

27:42.876 --> 27:44.709
for San Jose, Costa Rica.

27:44.711 --> 27:47.345
Whoa, she's fleeing the
country in less than 24 hours.

27:47.347 --> 27:49.047
Which means, whatever
she's doing with the virus,

27:49.049 --> 27:50.081
it's going down today.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.217
We just don't know
what, when or with whom.

27:52.219 --> 27:55.386
Well, Kensi and Deeks are
bringing me her hard drive.

27:55.388 --> 27:56.805
Hopefully there's
something on it.

27:56.807 --> 27:59.257
I just don't understand why
somebody would want to do this.

27:59.259 --> 28:00.859
Money? Revenge?

28:00.861 --> 28:02.560
Religious
fanaticism, maybe?

28:02.562 --> 28:06.114
Yeah, but it's just so stupid,
for lack of a better word.

28:06.116 --> 28:08.399
I mean, if you're smart enough
to regenerate this virus,

28:08.401 --> 28:09.701
then you're smart enough
to understand

28:09.703 --> 28:11.236
the dangers that surround it.

28:11.238 --> 28:14.289
No kidding. It's hard enough to
get your hands on the vaccine.

28:14.291 --> 28:15.573
Hold up.

28:15.575 --> 28:16.658
You're a genius.

28:16.660 --> 28:17.742
Well, yeah.

28:17.744 --> 28:20.444
Wait, what
do you mean?

28:20.446 --> 28:21.612
The vaccine.

28:21.614 --> 28:23.248
Whoever is
handling this stuff

28:23.250 --> 28:24.949
understands how
dangerous it is, right?

28:24.951 --> 28:27.785
So they're going to want to be
vaccinated before they touch it.

28:27.787 --> 28:30.121
Yeah, but you can only
get the vaccine if you're

28:30.123 --> 28:32.290
in the military or a
specialized health care worker.

28:32.292 --> 28:34.309
Exactly.
And if you're not...

28:34.311 --> 28:36.227
Well, you'd have
to... steal it.

28:36.229 --> 28:37.962
From either a military base

28:37.964 --> 28:39.564
or a State Health Department
facility.

28:39.566 --> 28:41.132
Worth a shot.

28:41.134 --> 28:42.133
Here we go.

28:42.135 --> 28:43.434
Two weeks ago, break-in at

28:43.436 --> 28:45.469
the State Health Department
facility in Torrance.

28:45.471 --> 28:48.356
So, like you were
saying, I am a genius.

28:48.358 --> 28:50.492
Right. I'll tell Hetty.

28:50.494 --> 28:52.277
Hope that high-five
means good news.

28:52.279 --> 28:54.245
We'll find out soon enough.
How'd you guys make out?

28:54.247 --> 28:55.864
Well, we learned that
Kensi missed her calling.

28:55.866 --> 28:57.081
She should have been a doctor.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.116
It was disgusting.

28:58.118 --> 28:59.417
Have you ever put in a catheter?

28:59.419 --> 29:00.502
Not professionally.

29:00.504 --> 29:03.087
Is that Rachel
Holden's hard drive?

29:03.089 --> 29:04.589
Yeah, but I think
it's been wiped clean.

29:04.591 --> 29:05.423
There's nothing on it.

29:05.425 --> 29:07.175
(chuckles)
For you maybe.

29:07.177 --> 29:08.960
Ah, I bet this
baby's got

29:08.962 --> 29:11.129
plenty of secrets to tell
me, don't you, honey?

29:11.131 --> 29:12.630
You're a good little
girl, aren't you?

29:12.632 --> 29:13.631
You know it.

29:13.633 --> 29:14.933
I...

29:14.935 --> 29:16.667
I'll let you know
what I find.

29:16.669 --> 29:18.136
You do that.

29:18.138 --> 29:19.670
What do you think
the chances are

29:19.672 --> 29:21.122
that he has
a homemade sex robot?

29:21.124 --> 29:22.390
Why, did you break
yours again?

29:22.392 --> 29:23.507
No, Robo-Kensi's
still going strong.

29:23.509 --> 29:24.675
Oh, you disgust me.

29:24.677 --> 29:27.478
Robo-Kensi never
talks to me like that.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.148
This is the man the LAPD
suspects in the break-in

29:30.150 --> 29:31.649
at the State Health
Department facility.

29:31.651 --> 29:33.651
His name is Gabriel Marchal.

29:33.653 --> 29:35.036
Pretty name

29:35.038 --> 29:36.621
for an ugly man.

29:36.623 --> 29:39.574
Robbery has passed the case
over to Narcotics.

29:39.576 --> 29:42.493
Narcotics doesn't want to move
on the case because they feel

29:42.495 --> 29:44.495
nothing of significant
street value was stolen;

29:44.497 --> 29:46.030
they want to build their case.

29:46.032 --> 29:47.465
None of which helps us.

29:47.467 --> 29:49.551
No, but Marchal is linked
to several unsavory groups.

29:49.553 --> 29:51.169
Remember the ELE?

29:51.171 --> 29:52.887
Enhanced Law Enforcement.

29:52.889 --> 29:54.672
They're a homegrown
militia group.

29:54.674 --> 29:57.008
The ELE took it upon themselves
to secure the border

29:57.010 --> 29:58.092
by killing innocent people.

29:58.094 --> 30:00.228
But we took those guys
down two years ago.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.013
Apparently not all of them.

30:02.015 --> 30:03.547
Well, it makes sense,
in a sick way.

30:03.549 --> 30:04.899
You want to stop
immigration forever,

30:04.901 --> 30:07.185
release an epidemic
of smallpox in Mexico.

30:07.187 --> 30:09.103
Our government
would have no choice

30:09.105 --> 30:10.772
but to lock down the border.

30:10.774 --> 30:12.991
So where do we find these guys?

30:19.582 --> 30:22.283
Have backup ready to roll in
and lock this place down

30:22.285 --> 30:24.369
the minute you hear from me.

30:24.371 --> 30:25.536
(camera clicking)

30:25.538 --> 30:28.089
Hey, so I got three out front,
two on the inside,

30:28.091 --> 30:29.257
that I can see, anyway.

30:29.259 --> 30:30.741
And every one of them
is packing.

30:30.743 --> 30:33.711
This place will clear out
once the sun goes down,

30:33.713 --> 30:35.046
but we don't have time for that.

30:35.048 --> 30:36.431
SOP would be
to evacuate the area

30:36.433 --> 30:37.882
and send in
a tactical hazmat team.

30:37.884 --> 30:38.850
I like that.

30:38.852 --> 30:41.102
Send in the professional
bug hunters.

30:41.104 --> 30:42.586
Unfortunately, these people
are paranoid by nature.

30:42.588 --> 30:44.555
They see us clearing area,
they're going to go ballistic.

30:44.557 --> 30:46.557
Same thing if they see
someone in a hazmat suit.

30:46.559 --> 30:47.591
Yeah, Callen's right.

30:47.593 --> 30:49.093
We can try and take
these guys quietly,

30:49.095 --> 30:51.396
but if they decide to open up
with all these tourists around,

30:51.398 --> 30:52.697
there's going to
be a blood bath.

30:52.699 --> 30:55.766
Maybe we don't
take them quietly.

30:55.768 --> 30:57.051
Why are you smiling?

31:00.723 --> 31:02.657
Chin, why are
you smiling?

31:02.659 --> 31:04.542
Why are you smiling now, too?
Everybody's smiling.

31:04.544 --> 31:05.710
Everybody's smiling except me.

31:05.712 --> 31:06.711
You can smile.

31:06.713 --> 31:08.129
No, no, I only smile
when I'm happy.

31:08.131 --> 31:10.248
And this does not make me happy,
it makes me very nervous.

31:10.250 --> 31:11.449
So give me your nervous smile.

31:11.451 --> 31:12.634
(laughs)
Like that?

31:12.636 --> 31:14.218
Yeah, something
like that.

31:19.808 --> 31:23.094
(bulldozer revving)

31:23.096 --> 31:24.012
(loud clattering)

31:24.014 --> 31:25.647
DANNY:
Earthquake!

31:37.226 --> 31:39.410
CALLEN:
Federal agents!

31:39.412 --> 31:40.361
Out of there!

31:40.363 --> 31:41.496
Move!
Go on.

31:41.498 --> 31:43.297
Hands where I can see
them. Hold them up.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.451
It's not here.

32:05.837 --> 32:07.305
What does that mean?

32:07.307 --> 32:09.524
I think that means
they didn't find it.

32:11.393 --> 32:13.528
It means we're screwed.

32:30.374 --> 32:33.126
(line ringing)

32:33.128 --> 32:34.711
NELL:
Callen.

32:34.713 --> 32:37.997
Gabrielle Marchal denies getting
anything from Dr. Rachel Holden.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.550
Well, I've got proof
he wired over $100,000

32:40.552 --> 32:43.052
to a bank account in Honolulu
six weeks ago.

32:43.054 --> 32:45.838
So he and his group bankrolled
her in exchange for the virus,

32:45.840 --> 32:47.507
but she ripped them off instead?

32:47.509 --> 32:49.175
The good doctor
has a death wish.

32:49.177 --> 32:50.927
Yeah, she does.

32:50.929 --> 32:52.845
For all of us.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.814
Did Eric get anything
off her computer?

32:54.816 --> 32:57.150
Dr. Rachel Holden did
a fairly decent job

32:57.152 --> 32:58.434
of erasing her
hard drive.

32:58.436 --> 32:59.802
Looks like she
never used it

32:59.804 --> 33:00.987
for anything
other than work.

33:00.989 --> 33:01.988
She left it behind

33:01.990 --> 33:03.656
because there was
nothing for us to find.

33:03.658 --> 33:04.791
I did, however, find

33:04.793 --> 33:06.409
some of her published
research articles,

33:06.411 --> 33:07.810
several of which
deal with pandemics.

33:07.812 --> 33:10.146
She's an immunologist--
that's what she does.

33:10.148 --> 33:12.582
Yeah, but it's the nature
of her later articles

33:12.584 --> 33:14.584
that's a little disturbing.

33:14.586 --> 33:16.903
How so?

33:17.871 --> 33:19.539
KENSI: In her most
recent article,

33:19.541 --> 33:21.624
Holden posits that pandemics
are a natural part

33:21.626 --> 33:23.676
of the ebb and flow of
life on this planet,

33:23.678 --> 33:24.961
and that by
interfering with it,

33:24.963 --> 33:26.796
we are meddling
with nature

33:26.798 --> 33:28.848
in a way that could lead
to our undoing.

33:28.850 --> 33:30.666
Mm.

33:30.668 --> 33:32.552
The Gaia theory.

33:32.554 --> 33:36.272
The idea that the Earth
is a complex interactive system

33:36.274 --> 33:39.392
that keeps life
in balance.

33:39.394 --> 33:41.878
Essentially, the planet
is a self-cleaning oven.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.312
KENSI:
Exactly.

33:43.314 --> 33:45.514
She also posits that
by wiping smallpox

33:45.516 --> 33:47.367
off the face
of the Earth,

33:47.369 --> 33:50.570
we've eliminated one of
the planet's regulating systems.

33:50.572 --> 33:53.623
She believes
she's doing God's work

33:53.625 --> 33:57.026
by releasing a plague
of biblical proportions.

33:57.028 --> 33:59.328
In her mind, the only way
to save the planet

33:59.330 --> 34:02.248
is by allowing it to naturally
thin out the human herd--

34:02.250 --> 34:04.300
in this case, through smallpox.

34:04.302 --> 34:06.469
KENSI: She's intending
on leaving in the morning,

34:06.471 --> 34:08.504
which means whatever
she's planning

34:08.505 --> 34:10.956
is going to go down
in the next few hours.

34:12.476 --> 34:14.010
DANNY (sighs):
Okay.

34:14.012 --> 34:15.812
Maybe Dr. Holden is planning

34:15.813 --> 34:17.397
on taking the
virus with her.

34:17.399 --> 34:19.849
Costa Rica looks like
a place more to hide out

34:19.851 --> 34:21.234
than to launch
a pandemic.

34:21.235 --> 34:23.052
You'd want to spread it
as quickly as possible.

34:23.054 --> 34:24.821
Like at an
international airport.

34:24.822 --> 34:27.239
Maybe she left it
at the airport.

34:27.242 --> 34:29.574
International passengers
come in contact with it,

34:29.577 --> 34:31.226
take them with them
wherever they go.

34:31.228 --> 34:32.829
But she's got to know
we'll be looking for her.

34:32.831 --> 34:34.464
I mean, all the airports
are on high alert.

34:35.282 --> 34:37.399
Okay, so I think
I got something.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.400
Two months ago, she ordered
enough office supplies

34:39.402 --> 34:40.703
to stock a small business.

34:40.705 --> 34:43.539
Didn't think anything of it
until I found this.

34:43.541 --> 34:47.009
An order for 300 custom T-shirts
from a local clothing company.

34:47.011 --> 34:48.878
And when I called
the office supply store,

34:48.880 --> 34:50.246
they confirmed
that most

34:50.248 --> 34:51.746
of the purchases
were school supplies.

34:51.748 --> 34:53.099
DANNY:
Wait a minute.

34:53.101 --> 34:54.750
She's targeting kids?

34:54.752 --> 34:56.552
That's her dispersal mechanism.

34:56.554 --> 34:57.920
Like the British giving blankets

34:57.922 --> 35:00.422
infected with smallpox
to Native Americans.

35:00.424 --> 35:01.858
You give a kid a T-shirt,

35:01.860 --> 35:03.810
he takes it home,
he infects his family.

35:03.812 --> 35:05.845
She could be donating it
to schools.

35:06.780 --> 35:08.764
Do you remember
when we were at the airport?

35:08.766 --> 35:11.150
There was that group
of teenagers at baggage claim?

35:11.152 --> 35:13.035
It was a class trip of sorts.

35:13.037 --> 35:14.954
It's too late
for spring break, right?

35:14.956 --> 35:16.539
KENSI:
I don't know, but there was

35:16.541 --> 35:18.574
a group of Japanese students,
and I'm pretty sure

35:18.576 --> 35:21.577
I heard other kids
speaking German.

35:21.579 --> 35:22.995
(sighs) Damn it.

35:22.997 --> 35:25.114
International Leaders
of Tomorrow.

35:25.116 --> 35:26.199
"High School seniors

35:26.201 --> 35:27.500
"representing 36
different countries

35:27.502 --> 35:30.837
"are gathering for a series
of lectures and exercises

35:30.839 --> 35:33.222
"designed to encourage
dialogue, understanding,

35:33.224 --> 35:35.007
tolerance and friendship."

35:35.009 --> 35:36.625
That's definitely not
as fun as spring break.

35:36.627 --> 35:37.927
We need to shut it down.

35:37.929 --> 35:39.595
It's too late.

35:39.597 --> 35:41.814
It started
an hour ago.

36:05.639 --> 36:07.790
Hey, hey.
You... you got to put

36:07.792 --> 36:08.824
that bag down.

36:08.826 --> 36:10.659
CHIN: Drop the bags!
Okay.

36:10.661 --> 36:12.995
Whoa, what's
your damage, dude?

36:12.997 --> 36:15.298
My damage, genius,
is that I'm a cop

36:15.300 --> 36:16.883
and I just saved
your life.

36:16.885 --> 36:18.601
- Where'd you get this?
- Get your own, man.

36:18.603 --> 36:19.752
They're giving them away
for free.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.438
We got a location.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.505
Southeast corner.

36:23.507 --> 36:24.607
I see her.

36:24.609 --> 36:25.892
Blue awning.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.109
Federal agents!

36:29.046 --> 36:29.962
Callen, she's running!

36:29.964 --> 36:31.197
CALLEN:
We got her, Kensi.

36:31.199 --> 36:33.149
Lock it down
and scramble hazmat.

36:41.275 --> 36:42.909
(engine starts)

36:49.483 --> 36:52.285
(tires squealing)

37:04.648 --> 37:05.765
We got the vials.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.567
Get out of the car.

37:07.569 --> 37:09.302
Out of the car now.

37:13.156 --> 37:14.657
Rachel Holden,
you're under arrest.

37:14.659 --> 37:18.861
The Earth is dying,
and we are the disease.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.947
I was just trying to give
the planet a fighting chance.

37:20.949 --> 37:22.782
By killing millions of people?

37:22.784 --> 37:25.251
It took tens
of thousands of years

37:25.253 --> 37:28.120
for the planet's population
to reach a billion.

37:28.122 --> 37:31.958
But we've gone from six
to seven billion in 12.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.909
You do the math.

37:33.911 --> 37:35.344
No, I hate math.

37:35.346 --> 37:37.096
What happened if your pandemic
killed the people

37:37.098 --> 37:38.747
who could one day solve
our problems?

37:38.749 --> 37:40.600
You didn't think
about that one, did you?

37:40.602 --> 37:42.134
It's all right.

37:42.136 --> 37:43.585
You'll have
plenty of time

37:43.587 --> 37:45.421
to think about
it in prison.

37:46.756 --> 37:48.824
Get her out of here.

37:57.034 --> 37:59.101
The Health Department
and the CDC

37:59.103 --> 38:01.954
have secured the gift bags
and are vaccinating

38:01.956 --> 38:03.572
anyone who may
have been exposed.

38:03.574 --> 38:05.074
ERIC: And Assistant
Director Granger

38:05.076 --> 38:07.710
called to thank the Five-O
Task Force for their assistance.

38:07.712 --> 38:08.777
What, that's it?

38:08.779 --> 38:10.379
I think that's
pretty much everything.

38:10.381 --> 38:12.164
Did we miss something?

38:12.166 --> 38:13.215
Yeah, you missed the fact

38:13.217 --> 38:14.450
that we basically
saved the world.

38:14.452 --> 38:16.285
DEEKS: Oh, that's a tad
dramatic, my friend,

38:16.287 --> 38:17.586
but accurate nonetheless.

38:17.588 --> 38:18.554
He's right--
it's a big deal.

38:18.556 --> 38:20.289
I mean, we should get
some sort of medals

38:20.291 --> 38:21.957
or at least some sort
of presidential commendation.

38:21.959 --> 38:23.259
We don't need medals.

38:23.261 --> 38:25.845
I'd like it if Air Force One
picked us up and flew us

38:25.847 --> 38:27.796
over to Vegas and gave us
a complimentary suite

38:27.798 --> 38:29.432
in one of the
high roller rooms.

38:29.434 --> 38:31.684
Nice. That's what I'm talking
about. This man has vision.

38:31.686 --> 38:33.769
You know what? I'll settle for
a hot shower and a cold beer.

38:33.771 --> 38:36.188
Well, the shower's on you guys,
beer's on us.

38:36.190 --> 38:37.657
It's the least we could do.

38:37.659 --> 38:39.408
Uh, we appreciate it,
but we really should go.

38:39.410 --> 38:40.743
What, you're not
going to stay for a drink?

38:40.745 --> 38:41.777
You got a hot
date, Danny?

38:41.779 --> 38:42.978
No. Uh, we left
the kids in charge

38:42.980 --> 38:44.363
of the island, so we got to go.
Ah.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.699
Well, there's that,
and he's scared of Hetty.

38:46.701 --> 38:47.833
I'm not scared of Hetty.

38:47.835 --> 38:49.669
Okay, I think she's
a delightful lady,

38:49.671 --> 38:50.652
but have you
ever seen

38:50.654 --> 38:52.038
<i>Trilogy of Terror?</i>

38:52.040 --> 38:53.839
You know the little, uh,
voodoo doll,

38:53.841 --> 38:55.124
comes to life?
Shh.

38:55.126 --> 38:56.042
(clears throat)

38:56.044 --> 38:59.178
HETTY:
Starring Karen Black.

38:59.180 --> 39:03.015
I worked with her and Nicholson
on <i>Five Easy Pieces.</i>

39:03.017 --> 39:06.602
Or, as I like to call it,
<i>Six Hellish Weeks.</i>

39:06.604 --> 39:08.170
(chuckles)

39:09.222 --> 39:11.774
That's, uh... that's very cool.

39:11.776 --> 39:13.392
Hmm.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.444
HETTY:
Fortunately,

39:15.446 --> 39:17.513
your talent for police work

39:17.515 --> 39:20.682
far exceeds your gift
for discourse, Detective.

39:21.451 --> 39:24.620
Well, on behalf
of myself

39:24.622 --> 39:26.455
and NCIS, I'd like to thank

39:26.457 --> 39:28.357
Detective Williams
and Detective Kelly

39:28.359 --> 39:30.359
for their assistance.

39:30.361 --> 39:32.244
You are most welcome.

39:33.046 --> 39:34.997
I don't bite,
Detective.

39:34.999 --> 39:36.966
Unless provoked.

39:36.968 --> 39:38.334
Okay. I will never
provoke you.

39:38.336 --> 39:39.802
I promise.

39:39.804 --> 39:41.921
Uh, we really do
have a plane to catch.

39:41.923 --> 39:43.672
But next time,
we will take you up

39:43.674 --> 39:45.007
on your offer for drinks.

39:45.009 --> 39:47.309
And maybe we can take a
little side trip to Disneyland.

39:47.311 --> 39:48.644
Disney...? What are you, 12?

39:48.646 --> 39:49.812
I will have you know

39:49.814 --> 39:51.880
that it is
the happiest place on Earth.

39:51.882 --> 39:53.265
See, that's not cool.

39:53.267 --> 39:55.935
Uh, good luck
with your Gypsy blood feud.

39:55.937 --> 39:57.186
Yeah, let's do it again
sometime.

39:57.188 --> 39:58.988
Just not any time soon.

39:58.990 --> 40:00.439
Aloha.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.108
Aloha.

40:04.277 --> 40:07.496
Well, I think they would make
good NCIS agents.

40:07.498 --> 40:10.232
Yeah, now we know where to go
if we need a Deeks replacement.

40:10.234 --> 40:12.451
Can't we just get one
from the pound, like last time?

40:12.453 --> 40:13.753
(laughter)

40:13.755 --> 40:15.121
HETTY: Detective
Williams is just

40:15.123 --> 40:17.573
a tad cheeky for my liking.

40:17.575 --> 40:19.408
No kidding.

40:19.410 --> 40:20.909
Reminds me of another
detective I know.

40:20.911 --> 40:22.011
DEEKS:
What? Me?

40:22.013 --> 40:23.179
No, no. No, no.

40:23.181 --> 40:24.547
I'm not cheeky; I'm charming.

40:24.549 --> 40:26.682
And I'm so much funnier
than him, am I not?

40:26.684 --> 40:28.050
Guys?

40:28.052 --> 40:30.302
Can you back me up on this?
I'm actually much funnier?

40:30.304 --> 40:32.638
I just want you to stop
and think for a second

40:32.640 --> 40:34.557
what this place
would be like without me.

40:39.293 --> 40:40.827
Let me see.

40:40.829 --> 40:43.498
Peaceful, professional,
sanitary.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.383
Feel free to stop me
any time, Mr. Deeks.

40:45.385 --> 40:49.385
