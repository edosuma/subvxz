just chasing Mosaic, do we?

Oh, God.

You'll love him.

how well we're doing,

to renegotiate

and try PacBell,

You know, you didn't have to sit
around and wait for me.

actually been available...

for me.

away wasn't far enough.

than it had any right to be,

32:17.236 --> 32:19.438

with a lot of my own stuff.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.107
Oh, right, your game.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.475
I'm sure that was tough,
being funded, promoted, coddled.

investments.

Let's get started.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.415
Well, first off,
let me just say,

34:09.448 --> 34:11.350
on behalf of the Rover
brain trust,

34:11.383 --> 34:13.085
it's great
to see you again.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.753
We're moving past
the beta phase.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.289
We are already underway
in three med schools,

34:17.323 --> 34:18.790
with requests
for two more.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.162
A little more sobering,
though,

34:23.195 --> 34:25.697
is that we've gone
through our seed round

34:25.731 --> 34:28.567
just a hair faster
than expected, and now...

34:28.600 --> 34:30.169
Now you need more money.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.503
Vera: Well, yes.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.872
It's either that
or we let some people go --

34:33.905 --> 34:35.307

But this is still

only on medical records.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.414
Yes, through binary queries
into the data pool,

34:42.448 --> 34:45.651
but we're refining comparisons
to make things more versatile.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.187
Okay, I'll just cut
to the chase here.

34:48.220 --> 34:51.690
I've given you enough funding
for a medical database program.

34:51.723 --> 34:54.826
If you want more funding,
I will need a bigger idea.

in 24 hours.

quick turnaround.

be the door.

Maybe it's not a browser.
In fact, it shouldn't be.

like a directory.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.469
Yes, but more than that.

thing yet, but --

right there.

was that party, Gordon?

I wanted to celebrate
our success.

to convince yourself

that it's okay to stop
when every fiber of your being

36:01.960 --> 36:03.929

to keep going.

I've been telling you for years
that you are a builder.

You need to build.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.736
You know what, Joe?
I built this.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.704
I built all of this
when you were downstairs

36:12.738 --> 36:14.873
in the basement screwing around
with Post-it notes.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.442
Did Cameron put you
up to this?

36:16.475 --> 36:18.176
I noticed
that she stopped by today.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.714
Of course she did.

is that you put

the game's controls
in the manual.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.429
-No.
-That's it.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.731
No, the worst thing
you can do with a magic trick

36:39.765 --> 36:40.999
is explain how it works.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.235
No matter how much
the audience asks,

36:43.269 --> 36:44.736
it's so much
more rewarding

36:44.770 --> 36:46.972
if they get to discover it
for themselves.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.740
You have to respect
the player.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.379
Hey!

36:53.412 --> 36:55.481
[Door closes]

36:59.651 --> 37:00.719
[Door opens]

37:00.752 --> 37:01.753
So?

37:01.787 --> 37:03.622
[Door closes]

37:03.655 --> 37:05.691
It's a trip, huh?

37:08.460 --> 37:10.629
Cameron,
what are you doing here?

37:10.662 --> 37:12.798
I told you.
I have to promote the game.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.833
No, I mean,
what are you doing here?

37:14.866 --> 37:17.002
This shit
was all behind us.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.970
The browser?

37:19.004 --> 37:20.406
Joe.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.441
You have no idea how hard
he's worked

37:22.474 --> 37:25.944
to get back to where he is --
how hard I've worked.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.613
And now, all of a sudden,
you know,

37:27.646 --> 37:29.548
you feel guilty
about no-showing on Loadstar.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.717
You come back into his life
and you got him spinning.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.685
-I didn't do anything.
-Look, you spent five minutes

37:33.719 --> 37:35.554
with him in the basement,
and now he's convinced

37:35.587 --> 37:37.456
that you've handed him fire
from the mountaintop.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.558
Look, I'm not saying that
you're doing this on purpose,

37:39.591 --> 37:41.693
but every single time that you
come back into his life --

37:41.727 --> 37:43.395
I owed him that work.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.397
I owed both of you.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.867
You know, yesterday
you asked me if you were cruel.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.838
[Knock on door]

37:55.341 --> 37:57.409
Sorry. We only have the room
until 10:00.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.412
[Door closes]

38:02.481 --> 38:05.517
It was great
to see you, Gordon.

38:08.620 --> 38:13.992
**

38:14.025 --> 38:17.563
[Door opens, closes]

38:24.803 --> 38:25.937
Gordon: Yeah. I mean, isn't that
why God created hangovers --

38:27.806 --> 38:29.775
teach teenagers
not to drink so much?

38:29.808 --> 38:31.042
Drinking is one thing.

38:31.076 --> 38:33.111
Okay, well,
it's better off at home

38:33.144 --> 38:35.681
with one of us
than somewhere else, right?

38:35.714 --> 38:37.949
Gordon, it's fine.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.951
She told you
she's not going to college yet,

38:39.985 --> 38:42.087
or is she still
just torturing me with that one?

38:42.120 --> 38:45.724
It's a positive that our
daughter has such a free spirit.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.360
Well, Joanie
is certainly resourceful.

38:48.394 --> 38:50.362
You wouldn't believe the variety
of household items --

38:50.396 --> 38:51.730
fruit, even --

38:51.763 --> 38:54.466
she's found a way
to smoke pot out of.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.569
Well, there's your selling point
right there.

38:57.603 --> 38:58.970
She'd love Berkeley.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.807
I'll talk to her.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.074
Thank you.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.479
It was weird to see Cameron
the other day,

39:07.513 --> 39:09.515
especially
in your sweatpants.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.417
Oh, well, you know,

39:11.450 --> 39:15.587
she's always had a major, major
thing for me.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.389
No.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.491
Yeah, well,
I liked that you thought

39:19.525 --> 39:20.992
it was even
a possibility.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.529
You know what she said to me
about Mosaic?

39:23.562 --> 39:25.831
She said, "I was surprised
it wasn't you."

39:25.864 --> 39:27.699
What is that
supposed to mean?

39:27.733 --> 39:29.134
I don't know.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.136
Her latest visit's
got Joe jumping up and down

39:31.169 --> 39:32.904
-about some new idea.
-Of course.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.673
Yeah, I mean,
he suddenly thinks

39:34.706 --> 39:38.510
he should index
every website in existence.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.479
How would you
even do that?

39:40.512 --> 39:44.015
Trust me, he's been meticulously
building a list of URLs --

39:44.049 --> 39:46.552
by hand --
for the last three years.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.520
That sounds
awfully tedious.

39:48.554 --> 39:49.821
Yeah, well, you know.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.458
Joe -- dog with a bone.

39:52.491 --> 39:54.192
That he is.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.995
And Cameron loves
to shit out rainbows

39:57.028 --> 40:00.432
to distract
from her asshole behavior.

40:02.534 --> 40:03.769
Wow.
[Clears throat]

40:03.802 --> 40:06.438
I'm gonna do the salmon.
You?

40:06.472 --> 40:08.940
Sounds good.
I'll do the same.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.642
Here's to Mosaic...

40:10.676 --> 40:13.945
and the respective death
of our competing browsers.

40:17.783 --> 40:20.986
Good news.
We nailed it.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.988
Magazines.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.457
We use the algorithm
to index back catalogs

40:25.491 --> 40:27.793
of major publications
one magazine at a time.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.861
Voilà --
a trove of text documents

40:29.895 --> 40:31.897
with an unstructured
data problem

40:31.930 --> 40:33.699
just waiting
to be solved.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.870
No, that's not it.

40:38.904 --> 40:42.641
Oh. Uh, we also discussed
legal service --

40:42.674 --> 40:45.744
backlogs of briefs
and precedents.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.179
-Well, we --
-Look, this is all dead data.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.081
What's growing?

40:50.115 --> 40:55.654
What can we apply
the algorithm to that's dynamic?

40:55.687 --> 40:57.956
We're in the future
business here.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.526
I don't know
how we index live data.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.894
Ah, well,
then that's unfortunate.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.531
Cecil: Uh, well,
what about the Web?

41:05.564 --> 41:08.934
The -- The number of websites
has grown 500% this year alone.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.603
By next year,
it could grow exponentially.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.573
At that point, the data pool's
theoretically limitless.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.107
We'd have to adjust
the algorithm,

41:16.141 --> 41:19.745
but we could endeavor
to index the entire Web,

41:19.778 --> 41:21.246
make it searchable.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.148
And how would you index it?

41:23.181 --> 41:24.783
W-With the algorithm.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.518
It'd be fully automated
and computerized.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.219
That means it'd be up to date
almost instantly

41:28.253 --> 41:30.221
with every
new site addition.

41:30.255 --> 41:38.129
**

41:38.163 --> 41:41.266
[Sighs]

41:41.299 --> 41:46.705
**

41:46.738 --> 41:49.541
That's it.

41:49.575 --> 41:51.943
That's the idea.

41:51.977 --> 42:01.887
**

42:01.920 --> 42:04.155
[Telephone rings]

42:07.292 --> 42:09.961
Joe: Don't tell me the reward
for solving Enso puzzle

42:09.995 --> 42:13.198
was getting transported back
to the beginning of the game.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.903
[Chuckles]

42:17.936 --> 42:19.971
I'm afraid I've got some
bad news for you.

42:20.005 --> 42:22.073
Oh.

42:22.107 --> 42:25.611
So the Enso is a zero,
and I've got to start over.

42:25.644 --> 42:29.314
Or maybe it means
everything.

42:29.347 --> 42:32.350
Now you can approach
the path you've taken

42:32.383 --> 42:34.085
in an entirely new way.

42:34.119 --> 42:36.622
Mm.

42:36.655 --> 42:40.659
I'm sorry
about the other day.

42:40.692 --> 42:43.128
I was just having trouble

42:43.161 --> 42:46.965
believing that the browser
was done,

42:46.998 --> 42:54.172
and I know that
that is...over now.

42:54.205 --> 42:56.875
I do.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.277
Regardless,
I don't want five months

42:59.310 --> 43:02.347
or five years to go by
before I hear from you.

43:02.380 --> 43:03.682
[Sighs]

43:03.715 --> 43:05.116
So don't
disappear again.

43:05.150 --> 43:10.355
I want to...
know you in my life.

43:10.388 --> 43:13.892
You already
know me, Joe.

43:13.925 --> 43:14.926
[Chuckles]

43:19.230 --> 43:21.867
I'm not going
back to Japan.

43:26.404 --> 43:28.206
Tom left me.

43:28.239 --> 43:38.049

43:38.083 --> 43:40.218

43:43.955 --> 43:49.695
