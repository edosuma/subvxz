08:06.402 --> 08:08.362
at the rec center,
and I am not gonna let Barton

08:08.446 --> 08:10.656
run that little girl's
big night.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.283
{\an1}- Wow.
You see, Stamps?

08:12.366 --> 08:13.618
She does have a heart.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.203
{\an1}- 'Cause if that brat
gets on the news,

08:15.286 --> 08:17.747
{\an1}we can kiss the
Latino vote good-bye.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.126
{\an3}- Well,
look who missed us.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.420
{\an3}Brown sugar
at two o'clock.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.255
{\an1}- I know that walk
anywhere.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.591
228 Wilmore Street.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.760
- You remember my address,

08:30.843 --> 08:32.761
{\an3}but you forgot
to pick these up.

08:32.845 --> 08:36.097
{\an3}- Well, if you have a complaint,
why don't you come up here

08:36.182 --> 08:38.851
{\an3}and tell it to
the Complaints Department?

08:42.104 --> 08:43.522
Oh, she's coming over here.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.982
{\an1}- Why'd you tell her
to come over here?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.568
{\an3}- They usually
never come over here.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.279
{\an3}- All right, guys, this is how
this is going to go.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.199
You will drive by my house;
you will pick up my garbage.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.825
{\an3}If you pick up
my neighbor's trash

08:54.909 --> 08:56.953
{\an3}and you don't pick up mine,
we got a problem.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.037
Do you want to have
a problem with me?

08:58.120 --> 09:00.498
{\an1}- No, no, no, ma'am.
No, we don't.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.208
{\an1}We're just
following orders.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.626
{\an3}- Mm-hmm.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.253
And what do you do

09:05.336 --> 09:07.797
when you receive orders
that you know are wrong?

09:07.880 --> 09:12.843
- In the army, I think
you still have to follow 'em.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.095
- Are you in the army?

09:14.178 --> 09:15.471
{\an1}- No, ma'am, no.
No, ma'am.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.348
{\an3}- Good.
I didn't think so.

09:17.431 --> 09:21.102
{\an3}So the question is, are you
gonna do the right thing?

09:21.185 --> 09:23.187
Are you garbage men,

09:23.271 --> 09:25.606
or are you garbage boys?

09:25.690 --> 09:30.569
- Well, we prefer the term
"sanitation technicians,"

09:30.653 --> 09:31.988
but we see your point.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.364
{\an3}- Good.
I got four bags

09:33.447 --> 09:35.533
{\an3}of lawn clippings
in my car, so come on.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.368
- Well, actually, ma'am,
those go to the facility--

09:37.451 --> 09:38.411
{\an1}- Oh.
We can take those.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.162
- Not a problem.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.248
- How long
we doing this?

09:42.331 --> 09:44.959
- Until we get justice.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.669
- Well, how long
is justice gonna take?

09:46.752 --> 09:49.046
'Cause I need to pee.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.091
{\an1}- I told you to pee
before we chained ourselves.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.302
- I did,
but a girl in her 40s

09:54.385 --> 09:56.679
can't hold her water
all day.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.390
{\an1}- 40s!
[laughs]

09:59.473 --> 10:01.517
- Yes, Frank, 40s!

10:01.600 --> 10:04.645
Same age as them
raggedy-ass pants you got on.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.189
- Pop, we're here
to take you home.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.151
- Yeah, come on, Dad, let's go.
The fun's over.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.652
- We're not leaving.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.279
I don't care
if we're here for a week.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.365
{\an1}- Oh, man.
Now I got to pee too.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.326
- Look, we can all
go home and pee

10:18.409 --> 10:21.537
like we're in
a public swimming pool.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.040
{\an3}-<i> ¿Quién es usted?</i>
<i>¿Por qué está aquí?</i>

10:24.123 --> 10:26.500
{\an3}<i>Tenemos la quinceañera</i>
<i>de mi hija in dos horas.</i>

10:26.584 --> 10:28.127
- Wha--what's she saying?
- Uh-uh--

10:28.210 --> 10:29.545
- Boyce, let me.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.297
<i>Señoras, lo siento.</i>

10:31.380 --> 10:35.134
{\an3}<i>Es muy triste.</i>
<i>Mi padre es viejo y loco.</i>

10:36.761 --> 10:38.054
- Now, I don't know Spanish,

10:38.137 --> 10:39.805
but I know <i> "loco"</i>
means "crazy."

10:39.889 --> 10:42.099
{\an3}- That's right, uh--
I said that you were crazy

10:42.183 --> 10:43.684
for justice.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.102
- Okay, yeah.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.730
I am <i> loco</i> for justice.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.733
- What the hell
is a quiny-cera?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.903
- It's a birthday party
for a little girl, fool.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.696
- Well, why is she
in a wedding dress?

10:55.780 --> 11:00.076
{\an3}- I don't know.
Maybe it's laundry day.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.162
{\an3}- Frank, Shirley,
can we have some privacy?

11:03.245 --> 11:04.830
{\an1}- No.

11:04.914 --> 11:08.417
{\an3}- Well, just scoot around
to the other side of the pole.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.925
{\an3}Come on, Dad, seriously,
let's go.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.134
- No.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.928
{\an3}- Look, you've made
your point.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.805
{\an3}You can hold your bingo
someplace else.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.098
- No, I won't.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.308
{\an3}- Of course you won't.
Why would you?

11:24.392 --> 11:26.268
{\an3}'Cause then you wouldn't
be able to complain

11:26.352 --> 11:28.270
that everything
is so lousy now

11:28.354 --> 11:30.231
compared to the way
things used to be.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.941
{\an1}- You think I want
to live in the past?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.484
- Yes, I do, Dad.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.026
- Oh, really?

11:34.110 --> 11:36.404
When, exactly?

11:36.487 --> 11:37.697
Do I want to go back

11:37.780 --> 11:40.324
{\an1}to growing up in the '50s
in Alabama?

11:40.408 --> 11:44.078
{\an1}Or how about the '60s?
You think I miss George Wallace?

11:44.161 --> 11:46.455
{\an1}He was a real hoot,
wasn't he?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.332
{\an3}- That's not
what I'm saying, Dad.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.959
{\an1}- Son, I was told
to back down by people

11:50.042 --> 11:52.002
{\an1}a hell of a lot scarier
than Saxby,

11:52.086 --> 11:55.423
{\an1}dozens of them,
in helmets, with sticks.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.050
{\an1}And I didn't back down,
even if it meant

11:58.134 --> 12:00.594
{\an1}getting hauled off to jail,
and you know why?

12:00.678 --> 12:03.889
{\an1}Because I believed that
if I stood my ground,

12:03.973 --> 12:05.141
my own children would have

12:05.224 --> 12:08.394
{\an1}an easier time of it
than I did.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.313
{\an1}Maybe I shielded you
too much, made you soft.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.690
- I'm not soft.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.860
{\an1}- Okay, not soft--
girly.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.903
- That's not better, Dad.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.031
{\an3}Look, Dad,
I'm angry too.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.283
I mean, I am.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.742
{\an3}The man cut off
my water and power.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.121
{\an3}But I'm trying
to run for mayor here.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.331
- I don't care!

12:29.415 --> 12:31.167
{\an1}Saxby is a tyrant
and a bully.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.169
{\an1}Him taking this room
away from us was wrong.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.839
{\an1}And you need to know,
I don't take wrong lying down.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.508
{\an1}So you can tell that
nice, little Spanish girl

12:39.592 --> 12:41.844
{\an1}in the wedding dress
that's she free to have

12:41.927 --> 12:43.846
her party around me,

12:43.929 --> 12:46.223
but I ain't leaving.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.391
{\an3}- Damn it.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.726
- I'm sorry, son.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.186
{\an3}- [sighs]
No.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.812
{\an3}I mean, damn it,
you're right.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.397
{\an3}I don't care what
Alicia says.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.441
{\an3}I've been laying down
too long.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.901
{\an3}It's time for me
to fight back.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.360
{\an1}- But before you go
fight back,

12:58.444 --> 13:00.362
{\an1}could you bring me
a bucket?

13:00.446 --> 13:01.989
- Make that two.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.908
{\an3}- What the hell
has happened to my life?

13:07.578 --> 13:09.205
<i>- Lollipop!</i>
- I'm in the kitchen!

13:09.288 --> 13:10.748
- Hey, babe.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.625
I made a decision.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.418
It's time to fight back.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.670
{\an3}- Great.
What are you gonna do?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.714
- I have no idea.

13:18.797 --> 13:22.009
I just know it's not a time
to sit around and be girly.

13:22.092 --> 13:25.054
{\an3}- [laughs]
Sounds like somebody's

13:25.137 --> 13:26.931
{\an3}been talking to
their daddy.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.557
- Yeah, but look,

13:28.641 --> 13:30.726
{\an1}the reason Saxby
is killing me right now

13:30.809 --> 13:33.395
{\an1}is because he has
the unions on his side.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.939
{\an1}I got to find a way
to get to them.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.234
{\an3}- What? Wait a minute.
Do garbage men have unions?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.735
{\an1}- Well, they prefer
to be called...

13:39.818 --> 13:41.403
[together]
Sanitation technicians.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.696
- Yeah, yeah.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.698
<i>- Guys, let me ask you</i>
<i>a question.</i>

13:44.782 --> 13:46.575
{\an1}You seem like decent,
stand-up guys,

13:46.659 --> 13:47.785
{\an1}but when the city
asks you

13:47.868 --> 13:49.620
{\an1}to do something
you know is wrong,

13:49.703 --> 13:51.163
doesn't it make you mad?

13:51.247 --> 13:52.414
- Yeah, but what can I do?

13:52.498 --> 13:53.916
{\an3}I got student loans
up the wazoo.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.418
{\an3}I thought I was
gonna be a doctor.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.628
- Oh.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.088
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.882
- No, I'm in a good place.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.593
- But see, that is the
only thing that really matters.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.222
{\an1}- Excuse me, I--
I-I was getting to something.

14:08.305 --> 14:11.976
Look, guys, look, I have
a message that you need to hear,

14:12.059 --> 14:13.727
but your union leadership

14:13.811 --> 14:15.396
won't even let me
through the door.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.398
So if you can just
get your guys together,

14:17.481 --> 14:20.526
get your union rep,
and just give me five minutes,

14:20.609 --> 14:22.111
that's all I ask.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.862
- Man, I don't know.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.990
{\an1}- Boy, he's trying
to improve your life!

14:26.073 --> 14:28.075
{\an1}Now, I know we not
gonna have a problem.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.411
- No.
- No, we'll make some calls.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.537
- Good.
That's good news.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.956
{\an1}Now, I look forward to
talking to you, all right?

14:34.039 --> 14:35.791
And by the way,

14:35.874 --> 14:37.376
she scares me too.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.336
- Boyce!

14:41.213 --> 14:43.299
{\an3}- Barton,
enough is enough.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.634
{\an3}The KTAZ news van
just pulled up.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.470
Let's end this before
any more damage is done.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.638
- Bring on the cameras.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.640
{\an1}Until we get justice,
the only way we're leaving

14:51.724 --> 14:54.518
{\an1}this rec center
is in cuffs or body bags.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.978
- Huh?
- Oh, whoa, whoa!

14:56.061 --> 14:58.314
Body bags?
This is just bingo.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.482
Now, I'll miss
a few of my stories for it,

15:00.566 --> 15:02.192
but I ain't ready to die.

15:02.276 --> 15:06.071
{\an1}- Yeah, I got a bingo app
on my phone.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.823
- Go ahead, quitters, go!

15:07.906 --> 15:09.325
You're dead to me.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.659
- See you Sunday.
- Bye, Barton.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.871
- Yeah, see you Sunday.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.289
- What's the problem here?

15:15.372 --> 15:18.626
- Well, what do you know?
They called in the po-po.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.171
- Officer,
this confused man

15:22.254 --> 15:24.340
accidentally chained himself
to the column.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.343
{\an1}- I'm not confused.
I'm standing up for my rights.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.804
{\an1}I'm <i> loco</i>
for justice.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.057
- Either way, just cut him loose
and get him out of here.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.475
- Well, I don't know.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.517
{\an3}What I'm seeing
is a peaceful demonstration.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.519
{\an3}- Peaceful?

15:37.603 --> 15:39.355
{\an3}He made that
15-year-old girl cry.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.398
- Ma'am,
she's a 15-year-old girl;

15:41.482 --> 15:44.026
it's what they do.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.862
{\an3}- Thank you so much
for mansplaining puberty.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.031
{\an3}Now, why don't you
do your job, Sparky?

15:49.114 --> 15:51.533
- No, uh--
excuse me, Officer.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.702
[chuckles]

15:53.786 --> 15:54.870
{\an1}Are you listening
to yourself?

15:54.953 --> 15:56.121
You need to calm down.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.998
{\an3}- Yeah, but this
whole thing is so stupid.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.500
{\an1}- Not to them,
it's not.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.502
{\an1}Look, there's a way out of this
where everybody wins.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.754
{\an1}Just be quiet for a minute
and watch me catch some flies.

16:03.837 --> 16:07.049
- Don't want flies.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.012
{\an3}- Listen, um,
Officer...Rhone.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.472
{\an3}[chuckles]
You know, my father

16:13.555 --> 16:14.848
{\an3}can really be stubborn
and set in his ways,

16:14.932 --> 16:16.892
{\an3}but he means
the world to me.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.060
Can you do me a favor?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.604
- What?
- Arrest him.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.814
- Arrest him?

16:21.897 --> 16:23.148
{\an3}- Yeah,
just do me a solid.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.234
- Arresting your dad
is doing you a solid?

16:25.317 --> 16:26.652
{\an3}- Trust me.
You don't know my dad.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.070
He won't back down.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.530
{\an3}I mean, this will go on
and on and on and on.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.031
{\an3}This girl's party
will be ruined.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.574
You'll be here
day after day

16:32.658 --> 16:33.826
listening to him chant,

16:33.909 --> 16:36.245
"No bingo, no peace."

16:36.328 --> 16:38.914
Come on, arrest him.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.040
The guy needs a win.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.333
{\an1}- [sighs]

16:41.417 --> 16:42.626
{\an1}All right.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.004
Sir,
you're under arrest.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.089
- What are the charges?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.132
- Uh...

16:48.215 --> 16:49.842
{\an1}- Trespassing,
being a public nuisance.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.970
- Yeah, trespassing and
for being a public nuisance.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.680
- Oh, what a surprise.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.641
{\an3}I challenge the city's power,
and what do you know?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.393
They bring the hammer down.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.352
Ah, you don't have to tell me

17:00.436 --> 17:02.438
I have the right
to remain silent,

17:02.521 --> 17:04.732
{\an3}'cause that ain't
gonna happen.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.775
{\an3}Somebody get
Jesse Jackson on the phone.

17:06.858 --> 17:11.320
{\an3}Bingo lives matter!
Call the AARP!

17:11.405 --> 17:13.656
- And that's why
I'm here today--

17:13.741 --> 17:16.242
{\an1}is to tell you
that I'm on your side.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.453
[all murmuring in agreement]

17:17.536 --> 17:18.704
- Look what's happened to you

17:18.787 --> 17:20.329
under two terms of Ron Saxby.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.459
{\an1}You've had a wage freeze
for three years.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.127
Your hours have gone up,

17:25.210 --> 17:28.547
{\an1}while your health benefits
have gone down.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.548
all: Yeah!

17:29.631 --> 17:30.758
- Look, my friends,

17:30.841 --> 17:33.677
{\an1}you may be
sanitation technicians,

17:33.761 --> 17:36.180
{\an1}but you should not
be treated like garbage.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.431
all: No!

17:37.514 --> 17:38.766
- Saxby is a tyrant...
all: Mm-hmm.

17:38.849 --> 17:42.978
- And a bully, and the way
that he treats the unions

17:43.061 --> 17:45.314
that make this city work
is wrong.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.106
- Wrong!
- Yeah!

17:46.190 --> 17:48.484
- The way that he uses you

17:48.567 --> 17:50.652
to do his dirty work--

17:50.736 --> 17:52.946
Bill, Sully--
is wrong!

17:53.030 --> 17:54.490
[all shouting]

17:54.573 --> 17:55.741
And everybody knows

17:55.824 --> 17:57.159
that two wrongs
don't make a right.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.535
all: No, no.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.954
{\an1}- The thing about being wrong
is that my dad told me

18:01.038 --> 18:03.999
{\an1}you don't take wrong
lying down.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.626
all: Yeah!
- He is right!

18:05.709 --> 18:06.960
Saxby playing us
for some chumps.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.213
- Yes, he is. Yes, he is.
- You tell 'em, Boyce.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.923
- And we're not
gonna take it anymore!

18:11.006 --> 18:12.591
all: No!
- There you go!

18:12.674 --> 18:14.593
Let's throw that trash
out of city hall!

18:14.676 --> 18:16.011
all: Yeah!

18:16.095 --> 18:17.679
- He's right!
We got to fight back!

18:17.763 --> 18:20.516
all: Yeah!
- We going on strike.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.351
- Uh, say what now?
- Say what now?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.560
- No, no, no, no, no,
that's not what he meant.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.187
all: Strike, strike, strike,
strike, strike...

18:25.270 --> 18:27.439
{\an1}- I just wanted
your endorsement, guys.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.900
{\an1}That's all I wanted.
"Boyce, Boyce, Boyce, Boyce."

18:29.983 --> 18:32.361
all: Strike, strike, strike...

18:32.444 --> 18:34.571
- No, no, no, no, no...

18:37.241 --> 18:38.742
<i>- And as the</i>
<i>sanitation workers' strike</i>

18:38.826 --> 18:40.702
<i>enters its second week,</i>
<i>the piles of garbage</i>

18:40.786 --> 18:44.039
<i>and residents' tempers</i>
<i>are running high.</i>

18:44.122 --> 18:45.707
- Nice work, Boyce.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.377
- Again, I didn't
tell them to strike.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.420
- Well,
I'm proud of you, son.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.381
You took a stand.

18:52.464 --> 18:56.385
You didn't pay the heavy price
that I did, but...

18:56.468 --> 18:57.803
still, I'm proud.

18:57.886 --> 19:01.640
{\an1}- Dad, you were in jail
for five minutes.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.934
- They let you keep
your pocket knife.

19:04.017 --> 19:07.145
- The point is,
I did my stretch,

19:07.229 --> 19:09.273
and now we got
bingo back.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.484
- Well, good for you,
Shawshank.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.570
Boyce, when this
is all said and done,

19:14.653 --> 19:17.030
I think people are gonna
see you as a hero.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.740
{\an1}- Not if Saxby
has his way.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.285
Listen to this statement
he made earlier today.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.328
"This is what happens
when a <i> singer</i> decides

19:23.412 --> 19:26.999
he can run the city--
it stinks."

19:27.082 --> 19:30.127
- "It stinks"?
That's not even clever.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.837
- Boyce, don't even
worry about it.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.672
You know,
Saxby's full of it.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.632
The people aren't gonna
blame you for this.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.760
{\an3}all: Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

19:38.844 --> 19:42.890
- The people might
blame you a little.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.349
