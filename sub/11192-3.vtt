WEBVTT

00:21.199 --> 00:23.157
What a mess!

00:23.160 --> 00:25.236
This temple was destroyed long ago.

00:25.239 --> 00:29.189
Let's get a move on before we meet
somebody who remembers why.

00:40.039 --> 00:42.115
<i>No signs of human life.</i>

00:42.557 --> 00:44.634
This could be some forbidden zone.

00:44.637 --> 00:47.009
<i>Wait. I hear something.</i>

00:46.996 --> 00:48.539
Sounds like dogs.

00:58.597 --> 01:00.673
No! Help!

01:03.476 --> 01:05.468
Help me!

01:12.635 --> 01:15.590
<i>Go on! Get out of here!</i>

01:18.593 --> 01:20.468
You OK?

01:20.674 --> 01:22.750
O... K?

01:24.075 --> 01:27.442
Yes, I am. Thanks be to you.

01:27.993 --> 01:31.078
But forgive me. I am Abu of the Shavadai.

01:31.274 --> 01:33.396
Shavadai?

01:33.394 --> 01:35.469
The people of the steppe.

01:36.712 --> 01:39.832
Uh... Hello. I'm Daniel Jackson. This is...

01:41.033 --> 01:42.277
- Jack.
- Jack.

01:42.871 --> 01:46.537
You are not from the people of the river.

01:46.472 --> 01:48.548
Uh... no.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.283
We're travellers from very far away.

01:52.272 --> 01:54.561
The Sea of Ogada?

01:54.991 --> 01:56.616
Sure.

01:57.790 --> 02:00.495
Never have we met anyone
from that far away.

02:00.471 --> 02:03.009
You will be doubly welcome
in my father's camp.

02:02.990 --> 02:06.489
This is Teal'c. And this is Dr. Carter.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.753
- The dogs are gone.
- For now.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.036
This is a woman?

02:15.031 --> 02:16.609
Oh, yeah.

02:17.349 --> 02:20.268
Do I have something
growing out of my nose?

02:21.469 --> 02:25.799
He looks really upset. It must be
some sort of cultural thing.

02:27.307 --> 02:29.300
No! I cannot look at you!

02:29.829 --> 02:32.533
<i>OK, now I'm hurt.</i>

02:34.108 --> 02:35.483
Abu!

02:35.508 --> 02:37.832
You must take her. Take her and go!

02:37.828 --> 02:39.903
Go!

02:46.507 --> 02:50.421
Raga. Raga. These people,
they are from the Sea of Ogada.

02:50.346 --> 02:53.182
- One is a woman?!
- Yes.

02:53.786 --> 02:58.033
- Colonel, I think they're Mongols.
- Is this good news?

02:58.105 --> 03:01.474
Daniel, find out what I did wrong
so I can fix it.

03:02.066 --> 03:04.818
No. No. Let them go.

03:04.784 --> 03:08.153
He's right. We'll just
take her with us and go.

04:49.617 --> 04:51.692
My son.

04:51.696 --> 04:55.396
When you did not return,
I feared you were dead.

04:55.334 --> 04:59.497
I would be in a dog's stomach now...
but for these.

05:04.415 --> 05:06.574
Is this any way to greet a stranger?

05:06.574 --> 05:09.065
That one is a woman.

05:10.173 --> 05:11.834
Observant bunch.

05:12.132 --> 05:16.463
Father, they come from the Sea of Ogada.
They do not know our ways.

05:16.374 --> 05:18.579
<i>Law is law.</i>

05:19.893 --> 05:23.177
<i>- What manner of weapon is that?
- It's a firearm.</i>

05:23.132 --> 05:26.004
It shoots like your bow shoots an arrow.

05:25.973 --> 05:27.430
She speaks!

05:27.454 --> 05:30.240
- She dies. Son!
- No! She saved my life!

05:38.372 --> 05:42.036
If a woman saved a life,

05:42.531 --> 05:44.191
hers cannot be taken.

05:46.409 --> 05:49.495
Now, you are my guests.

05:49.649 --> 05:54.276
If you will travel this country,
you must learn our ways.

05:55.209 --> 05:58.875
I'm thinking we should just
go back while we're ahead.

05:58.810 --> 06:01.098
If we learn their customs, we'll be OK.

06:01.088 --> 06:05.964
It's an incredible opportunity
to study an ancient culture up close.

06:21.088 --> 06:24.124
<i>They return! They found Abu!</i>

06:55.004 --> 06:57.081
This is unbelievable.

06:58.483 --> 07:01.603
The Mongols in Persian China
adapted to the local customs.

07:01.564 --> 07:06.523
But one tribe - the Chagatai - kept
the traditional life of the steppe nomad.

07:06.403 --> 07:09.358
Maybe these Shavadai
are their descendants.

07:11.603 --> 07:14.723
This camp could literally
belong to Genghis Khan.

07:14.682 --> 07:19.261
It's a living exhibit of a way of life
that's been extinct for 900 years.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.209
Please sit.

07:26.201 --> 07:28.574
Now you may talk.

07:28.562 --> 07:32.641
Good, cos I still don't understand
what happened out there.

07:32.562 --> 07:37.141
Among our people, it is death
for a woman to show her face in public.

07:37.441 --> 07:41.603
- Or to wear the clothes of a man.
- The old laws weigh heavily.

07:43.439 --> 07:49.858
<i>It is well you saved Abu from the dogs.
It gave me a way to prevent your death.</i>

07:50.079 --> 07:51.740
Uh... Thank you for that.

07:52.798 --> 07:58.670
Soon, the old laws and the old ways
will no longer serve us.

07:59.319 --> 08:04.658
Trade will one day replace war.
This is the future.

08:05.596 --> 08:10.343
We have the strongest, fastest
horses and camels,

08:10.237 --> 08:12.942
- The finest wool...
- And medicines.

08:14.237 --> 08:16.194
Drugs of unheard-of power.

08:16.197 --> 08:19.483
Oh, we've got some
pretty swell drugs of our own.

08:19.437 --> 08:24.396
Colonel, many breakthroughs in medicine
come out of the mountains and jungles.

08:24.276 --> 08:26.731
We should really see what he's got.

08:27.637 --> 08:30.970
I will show you. Follow me.

08:31.836 --> 08:36.414
I'm afraid you cannot go
until you are properly attired.

08:36.754 --> 08:41.333
- Properly attired?
- You should probably do what they want.

08:41.235 --> 08:46.360
Anthropologists do it all the time - dress
and live as the people they're studying.

08:47.033 --> 08:50.568
- I'm not an anthropologist.
- You are today.

09:10.952 --> 09:15.413
<i>I used the medicine on this wound
from a fire arrow in a recent skirmish.</i>

09:15.312 --> 09:17.054
The shoulder was badly burned.

09:17.072 --> 09:20.736
From the moment I began treatment,
there was no pain.

09:20.671 --> 09:26.293
- An anaesthetic we haven't seen before.
- We should take some back and test it.

09:37.629 --> 09:40.797
Daniel, find me an anthropologist
who dresses like this

09:40.750 --> 09:42.826
and I will eat this headdress.

09:48.349 --> 09:54.269
You are the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

10:04.988 --> 10:07.230
Guess the kid doesn't get out much.

10:07.227 --> 10:11.972
I will not wear this thing over my face.
I don't care how much embroidery is on it.

10:11.866 --> 10:17.739
And this... dress, or whatever it's called...
I can't move, I can't walk.

10:17.586 --> 10:19.662
I don't know.

10:20.186 --> 10:23.769
It... It kinda works for me.

10:24.265 --> 10:26.554
It's... It's you. It's...

10:29.184 --> 10:32.020
- It's you.
- Definitely you.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.831
The good news is, you were right.

10:38.823 --> 10:41.528
One of Abu's plants
seems to work as an anaesthetic.

10:41.504 --> 10:44.125
We're taking some home to be analysed.

10:44.104 --> 10:47.020
All things considered, Samantha,

10:47.984 --> 10:53.109
if we have to come back here, it might be
better if we brought an all-male team.

10:52.984 --> 10:54.607
No offence.

10:54.623 --> 10:57.375
In view of the fact that
you all get to go to this party

10:57.342 --> 11:00.462
while I stay in this yurt
that smells of rancid yak-butter,

11:00.423 --> 11:02.414
none taken.

11:02.422 --> 11:07.332
I'll just get a good night's sleep
and hope for better luck next time.

11:09.542 --> 11:12.163
See you. Good night.

11:18.780 --> 11:21.615
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Still doubting me?

11:21.580 --> 11:24.783
I haven't been afraid of the dark
since I was two.

11:24.740 --> 11:26.447
You look great.

12:19.416 --> 12:22.120
<i>Doctor, we're about ready to go!</i>

12:24.774 --> 12:26.850
Doctor, we're about ready to...

12:40.013 --> 12:42.421
<i>You better kill me now
because I am gonna talk.</i>

12:42.413 --> 12:46.113
- Here. You may drink and eat.
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

12:46.052 --> 12:49.138
There is something I want,
more than life itself.

12:49.452 --> 12:52.370
Until yesterday,
I thought it was impossible.

12:53.692 --> 12:56.562
And then I saw you, dressed like that,

12:56.533 --> 13:00.482
and I knew your beauty
would buy it for me.

13:01.052 --> 13:04.503
- What do you mean, "buy"?
- I will trade you.

13:04.571 --> 13:07.655
- You... you can't do that.
- I can.

13:07.610 --> 13:10.183
I'm a human being, not property.

13:11.970 --> 13:17.509
Where we are going, the men
are not as tolerant as my father.

13:17.370 --> 13:19.494
Be warned.

13:24.690 --> 13:28.437
- Any signs?
- No. No one's seen her since last night.

13:28.369 --> 13:32.448
Find Teal'c. I want everybody
ready to move out in 15 minutes.

13:32.369 --> 13:36.317
Well, let me talk to Moughal.
This could be another misunderstanding.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.739
- Cultural differences.
- The hell with culture.

13:38.729 --> 13:41.647
A member of my team is neutralised.
That's a hostile act.

13:41.607 --> 13:45.107
How is it that you always
come up with the worst-case scenario?

13:45.048 --> 13:47.124
I practise.

13:47.886 --> 13:50.557
I found fresh hoof prints
leading out of the camp.

13:50.528 --> 13:53.481
- That's great.
- The horse should be identifiable.

13:53.447 --> 13:57.230
- One of the hooves was splayed.
- The horse belongs to my son.

13:57.167 --> 14:01.163
- He is also missing.
- OK, Dad. What's goin' on here?

14:01.606 --> 14:04.893
- I am as ignorant as you.
- I don't think so.

14:05.047 --> 14:07.620
He took Captain Carter.
I want to know why.

14:09.046 --> 14:13.458
Among the Shavadai,
women are valued highly for trade.

14:13.365 --> 14:16.153
Foreign women most of all.

14:16.125 --> 14:20.039
- Can you help me track 'em?
- Now that I know what to look for, yes.

14:19.963 --> 14:23.298
If Abu gives her up peacefully,
no one will get hurt.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.744
Right?

14:26.524 --> 14:28.682
We'll do our best.

14:28.683 --> 14:31.389
I will give you horses,
and guide you myself.

14:32.323 --> 14:34.946
<i>My son has betrayed me as well as you.</i>

15:25.599 --> 15:30.344
Turghan may wish to bid me welcome.
I have come to trade.

15:36.157 --> 15:38.232
Then come, Shavadai.

15:46.557 --> 15:48.928
See the son of my enemy.

15:49.836 --> 15:52.956
How he pales in my presence.

15:58.475 --> 16:00.552
You risk your head coming here.

16:01.634 --> 16:03.876
For what? You think this interests me?

16:05.034 --> 16:06.695
Yes.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.889
I don't belong to this man.
I was abducted against my will.

16:16.953 --> 16:19.576
- Where is she from?
- The Sea of Ogada.

16:19.552 --> 16:21.345
My friends will come after me.

16:21.352 --> 16:23.975
They have powerful weapons
and won't hesitate...

16:23.952 --> 16:26.028
Silence!

16:27.354 --> 16:29.760
Or I will have you beaten.

16:30.994 --> 16:35.455
You may do whatever you wish with her...
when she is yours.

16:36.152 --> 16:38.227
Then I would see her.

16:41.873 --> 16:44.279
- Turn around.
- No.

16:51.509 --> 16:53.586
Slowly.

17:07.309 --> 17:09.634
Her skin is very fair.

17:12.469 --> 17:14.545
Look at me!

17:17.230 --> 17:19.306
Her eyes...

17:19.309 --> 17:22.394
are the colour of blue river stones.

17:25.387 --> 17:26.633
Sit.

17:33.866 --> 17:36.654
<i>Are you satisfied?</i>

17:38.906 --> 17:40.567
Name your price.

18:03.065 --> 18:05.141
<i>Why do you hesitate?</i>

18:07.144 --> 18:11.058
So name it. Gold? Horses? Weapons?

18:10.983 --> 18:13.938
I have the finest metal craftsmen
in the mountains.

18:13.904 --> 18:16.904
- No.
- What, then?

18:18.263 --> 18:20.055
Nya.

18:24.542 --> 18:27.080
You would trade a woman
for another woman?

18:27.501 --> 18:29.661
Nya is not just another woman.

18:29.662 --> 18:32.330
No. She is my daughter.

18:32.582 --> 18:36.626
She will marry a chieftain.
The desert warlord Chimakka.

18:37.622 --> 18:39.827
- Father, please...
- It is done!

18:40.101 --> 18:44.479
- Chimakka will come on the next moon.
- That's three days.

18:44.380 --> 18:47.166
How can you do that
to your own daughter?

18:48.739 --> 18:53.900
Your beauty will not
soften my anger much longer.

18:55.940 --> 18:59.771
The offer for the woman
is 300 weights of gold.

18:59.701 --> 19:02.903
Take it or die.
Either way, the woman is mine.

19:08.338 --> 19:10.330
Done.

19:28.537 --> 19:30.196
Here...

19:30.217 --> 19:35.423
a woman does not speak
unless she is spoken to.

19:47.375 --> 19:52.203
- They stopped here.
- To rest the horses. And so must we.

19:53.015 --> 19:55.386
For two marks.

19:59.733 --> 20:06.104
If we do not find them, I will pay
whatever you ask for the loss of Carter.

20:05.932 --> 20:08.683
We can't do that.
We don't "own" our women.

20:08.653 --> 20:10.730
- Truly?
- Yes.

20:11.452 --> 20:12.567
Um...

20:14.973 --> 20:18.840
And we heard stories
about Shavadai women,

20:18.772 --> 20:23.398
that once they were free, some even
fought with their husbands in battles.

20:23.291 --> 20:26.412
Mongol women might have been
the legendary Amazons.

20:26.372 --> 20:28.696
We do not speak of it.

20:29.172 --> 20:32.291
The laws for women were made
to protect and hide them

20:32.250 --> 20:35.666
from the demons
who brought us to this place.

20:35.612 --> 20:37.070
Demons?

20:37.089 --> 20:42.760
It is only in legend, and a long time ago,
in the dawn of our time.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.939
If the demons are gone,
why have not the laws been changed?

20:46.849 --> 20:49.174
Some say they will return.

20:49.169 --> 20:53.084
I think it is an excuse
for men to have their way.

20:53.009 --> 20:58.383
Among the Shavadai, even the lowliest
man is chief among his women.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.954
Is that why you only have one wife?

21:00.930 --> 21:03.171
To... set a kind of example?

21:05.528 --> 21:07.686
My people see it as a weakness.

21:09.488 --> 21:11.859
Because you love her?

21:42.244 --> 21:46.705
- My father will kill you.
- Come away with me. Tonight.

21:47.325 --> 21:50.278
You know I cannot. Now go,
before they find you here.

21:50.243 --> 21:52.319
I have listened to the wind.

21:53.203 --> 21:55.279
You will come.

21:56.044 --> 21:58.201
I will wait for you by the Tem tree.

22:06.481 --> 22:09.732
Now you are Toughai,
a woman of the forest.

22:11.563 --> 22:14.019
What can you do? Can you cook?

22:14.002 --> 22:16.493
Spin? Weave? Make dyes?

22:16.482 --> 22:20.432
I'm a lousy cook, and I couldn't spin,
weave or dye if my life depended on it.

22:20.362 --> 22:22.438
You made yourself a bad deal.

22:25.441 --> 22:28.691
Where you come from,
you must have done something.

22:29.400 --> 22:33.183
In my world, I am a warrior and a scholar.
I do the work of men.

22:38.119 --> 22:40.195
A warrior?

22:41.999 --> 22:44.075
Let me tell you what I do.

22:45.279 --> 22:48.197
I raid and burn the tents of my enemies.

22:48.159 --> 22:51.574
I slaughter the men
and trade the women and children.

22:52.718 --> 22:55.125
For this, I am feared.

22:57.238 --> 22:59.729
And because of that fear,

22:59.719 --> 23:04.511
I have the allegiance of 22 tribes.

23:04.397 --> 23:07.767
But you have to sell
your daughter off to make it 23?

23:07.718 --> 23:10.042
How would you like
to be hung upside down

23:10.038 --> 23:13.821
with dust-filled rags stuffed
in your mouth and nostrils?

23:14.676 --> 23:18.342
A slow death... from suffocation.

23:23.595 --> 23:26.714
I'm sorry. I'm sure
you know what's best for her.

23:34.434 --> 23:39.808
The spirits have brought you here
to teach you how to be a woman.

24:58.708 --> 25:02.373
- You belong to Turghan!
- Get your hands off me! Let me go!

25:07.905 --> 25:09.981
What kind of woman are you?

25:10.425 --> 25:13.628
Do you respect nothing?
Care for no one but yourself?

25:15.506 --> 25:20.712
These were responsible for you. Now,
because of you, they will be punished.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.470
No!

25:31.503 --> 25:35.548
<i>It was my fault. If you need to beat
a woman to feel like a man, try me.</i>

25:38.743 --> 25:41.827
I value spirit in my horses,
not my women.

25:49.342 --> 25:54.502
You belong to me. You will
learn your place and be obedient,

25:54.383 --> 25:57.252
or you will suffer far worse than a beating.

26:05.980 --> 26:08.388
I heard what you did for my mother.

26:08.380 --> 26:10.455
- I am grateful.
- That's OK.

26:12.819 --> 26:14.777
We are all afraid.

26:14.779 --> 26:17.567
If you do not obey, my father will kill you.

26:17.540 --> 26:18.915
I know.

26:18.940 --> 26:20.932
My father is a good man.

26:20.940 --> 26:24.807
He never mistreats a woman
unless she has done something wrong.

26:24.740 --> 26:27.065
There is no excuse to beat a woman, ever.

26:27.058 --> 26:29.347
He is a powerful warlord.

26:29.338 --> 26:33.252
Our women and our children are
always protected, always have food.

26:33.179 --> 26:37.590
How can you defend him? He's packing
you off to marry a total stranger!

26:38.457 --> 26:42.501
I have no choice. I'm not free to choose.

26:43.618 --> 26:46.618
And you never will be
until one of you says no.

26:54.977 --> 26:58.012
I want to say it. Will you help me?

27:08.536 --> 27:11.108
The tracks lead directly there.

27:11.096 --> 27:14.595
<i>- Who owns the place?
- An enemy.</i>

27:15.854 --> 27:17.930
A man who kills for pleasure.

27:19.294 --> 27:22.913
- This is very bad.
- Then we'll go in and get her out tonight.

27:23.453 --> 27:26.490
If we attack, there will be war.

27:27.294 --> 27:31.243
Turghan is allied with 22 clans,

27:31.174 --> 27:35.752
and when he fights,
he takes no prisoners.

27:37.532 --> 27:40.902
- You mean they'd kill all of you?
- Yes.

27:40.852 --> 27:44.351
If you will wait until morning,

27:44.291 --> 27:47.292
I will go and request trade.

27:48.051 --> 27:50.507
He cannot refuse.

27:50.491 --> 27:53.528
But what will happen to Dr. Carter
tonight if we wait?

27:55.612 --> 27:58.647
Turghan will partake
in his newest purchase.

28:00.051 --> 28:02.460
Oh, there's not a chance in hell.

28:04.770 --> 28:08.435
In our land, if a man
wants a woman, she can say no.

28:09.369 --> 28:13.865
No one refuses Turghan... and lives.

28:16.849 --> 28:18.426
Then we go now.

28:21.130 --> 28:23.205
<i>Stop! Dismount!</i>

28:30.448 --> 28:31.990
<i>Yes!</i>

29:07.125 --> 29:09.201
Go. Go, Nya, go!

29:16.804 --> 29:20.256
I paid 300 weights of gold.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.917
- Is that a lot?
- Enough to buy ten women.

29:25.123 --> 29:28.124
How much are you willing
to spend to get her back?

29:28.083 --> 29:31.665
We will offer 350 weights of gold.

29:32.042 --> 29:36.336
She is difficult... but beautiful.

29:38.682 --> 29:40.592
A rare prize.

29:40.961 --> 29:43.250
- 400?
- 400.

29:44.642 --> 29:48.686
- I may even make her a wife.
- Oh, for cryin' out loud. 500.

29:50.559 --> 29:52.137
We'll pay you back.

29:52.319 --> 29:54.395
Why this one?

29:55.561 --> 29:59.605
I have others - younger,
fit to bear many sons.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.596
Enough to start your own tribe.

30:01.601 --> 30:05.266
She is a woman of power for our people.

30:05.881 --> 30:08.585
Not only a warrior, but a...

30:08.558 --> 30:10.634
a shaman.

30:11.238 --> 30:16.030
The spirits of our land tell her when
to plant grain, when water will be scarce.

30:15.919 --> 30:19.252
<i>- Do you take me for a fool?!
- He speaks truly.</i>

30:19.198 --> 30:24.109
In the land of Ogada, the women
are as ours were, long ago.

30:25.678 --> 30:29.461
That, and more. Carter is our chieftain.

30:29.597 --> 30:31.756
Our people need her.

30:33.718 --> 30:37.465
Get out. You have nothing I want.

30:38.636 --> 30:40.546
Oh, yeah?

30:59.875 --> 31:01.416
Done.

31:07.792 --> 31:11.493
There's only five more rounds
in that clip. Time to go.

31:22.953 --> 31:27.082
Whoo! What a relief. I've never
been so happy to see you guys.

31:26.992 --> 31:29.032
Oh, sure you have.

31:29.031 --> 31:34.452
Remember that time on P3X-595? You
drank that stuff that made you take off...

31:34.311 --> 31:36.980
Ahem! We won't get into that right now.

31:37.672 --> 31:40.210
Moughal, I want to thank you
for your help.

31:42.230 --> 31:44.852
We'll leave at first light.

31:47.230 --> 31:51.275
I don't blame you for what Abu did.
I don't blame him either now.

31:52.151 --> 31:54.476
He is suffering the madness,

31:55.348 --> 31:57.637
as I did when I was young.

32:00.470 --> 32:04.005
- It's what they call "love".
- Ah. Got it.

32:32.067 --> 32:34.023
Please! You must help me!

32:34.027 --> 32:36.518
- What happened? Where's Nya?
- She came to me.

32:36.506 --> 32:38.830
Just like the wind said she would.

32:38.826 --> 32:42.361
But before we could make our way,
her father caught us.

32:42.306 --> 32:45.805
Now, if you don't help me,
she will be stoned to death!

32:55.625 --> 33:00.665
Curse me for the madness.
Better to have left her to marry Chimakka.

33:01.144 --> 33:05.605
I would not see anything I cared for
go to Chimakka.

33:05.503 --> 33:08.505
Can I get a little clarification here?

33:08.462 --> 33:11.961
Her own father ordered her
stoned to death - is that right?

33:11.903 --> 33:14.477
Because she broke the law of the land.

33:14.462 --> 33:17.133
Turghan is compelled to uphold the law,

33:17.102 --> 33:20.352
even more if it applies to his own.

33:20.303 --> 33:23.753
He must rule by example.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.612
We have to go back - now!

33:25.621 --> 33:29.452
- Negative.
- She can't be more than 16 or 17.

33:29.381 --> 33:34.375
If we try and get that little girl out,
we could be starting a war on this planet.

33:35.141 --> 33:38.057
- Since when are you a politician?
- Easy, Captain.

33:38.020 --> 33:40.427
<i>"De Oppresso Liber" -
"To Free from Oppression".</i>

33:40.421 --> 33:43.422
- Special Forces motto.
- I know what it is.

33:43.380 --> 33:45.622
<i>That's our world. This is theirs.</i>

33:45.619 --> 33:49.700
Do we have the right to interfere
in their customs or reinterpret their laws?

33:49.619 --> 33:51.778
Yes! Maybe you guys aren't getting this,

33:51.778 --> 33:56.156
but they are about to kill this teenage girl
simply for being in love with this boy!

33:56.058 --> 33:59.474
Please, use your weapons, and free her!

34:00.778 --> 34:05.903
Colonel is right. It would mean war, Abu.

34:06.978 --> 34:10.762
My son, you must choose...

34:11.619 --> 34:15.367
between one woman... and your people.

34:15.697 --> 34:17.773
I cannot.

34:19.775 --> 34:24.105
Neither can I. Nya broke the law because
of me. I can't leave her here to die.

34:24.335 --> 34:26.045
But if it is one life or many...

34:26.056 --> 34:29.056
Wait. There has to be another way.

34:29.016 --> 34:31.139
Moughal, what about the old laws?

34:31.135 --> 34:33.672
- Isn't there something we can...
- Yes.

34:34.295 --> 34:38.375
Yes, if we fight with law,
Turghan cannot make war.

34:38.295 --> 34:41.248
Father, please, think.

34:41.215 --> 34:43.291
Remember. There must be a law.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.369
There is one.

35:15.492 --> 35:18.742
Father! Forgive me.

35:30.291 --> 35:32.449
I forgive you.

35:46.528 --> 35:48.072
Stone her!

35:50.449 --> 35:52.108
<i>Do not!</i>

35:55.927 --> 35:58.170
You have no say here, Shavadai.

35:58.168 --> 36:01.501
A stoning may be challenged,
by another chieftain.

36:01.447 --> 36:04.235
- There is no such law.
- There is.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.929
In the song of Arkhan-Tyr.

36:11.367 --> 36:15.744
The spirits will strengthen
the hand of the just.

36:16.126 --> 36:18.202
I will not fight a cripple.

36:18.206 --> 36:19.865
You must.

36:22.286 --> 36:26.697
You insult my honour by implying
that I would engage in such a slaughter.

36:27.206 --> 36:30.242
You will lose,
and my daughter will still die.

36:30.646 --> 36:35.188
So unless there's another chieftain
who will challenge my decision...

36:37.885 --> 36:40.376
I challenge it.

36:44.923 --> 36:47.081
You!

36:47.083 --> 36:49.789
You plague me.

36:50.043 --> 36:53.744
Then fight. Here's your chance
to shut me up once and for all.

36:58.764 --> 37:02.927
I will abide by the wisdom of the spirits!

37:06.880 --> 37:11.045
<i>Let them decide justly.</i>

37:14.041 --> 37:17.041
When you're up against the wall
and there's no tomorrow,

37:17.001 --> 37:22.838
take one day at a time, and remember:
the bigger they are... etc.

37:22.681 --> 37:25.052
- You don't think I can win.
- Sure I do.

37:25.039 --> 37:27.875
I assume you've had
basic hand-to-hand training?

37:27.840 --> 37:29.916
Yeah. Level three, advanced.

37:29.918 --> 37:31.994
You'll do fine.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.643
Just out of curiosity, how do
the spirits determine who wins?

37:49.358 --> 37:51.646
It is a fight to the death.

37:54.757 --> 37:56.630
Death?

38:02.036 --> 38:03.994
Hey, no one said anything about...

38:06.356 --> 38:08.432
knives.

39:10.231 --> 39:13.065
- Carter, do not kill him!
- I don't want to.

39:13.030 --> 39:15.485
You have won. I am free to go with Abu.

39:15.469 --> 39:17.960
I want to hear it from you.

39:18.469 --> 39:20.925
She is free to go.

39:20.911 --> 39:23.199
<i>And the Shavadai?</i>

39:23.590 --> 39:27.338
By law, there can be no war between us.

39:27.269 --> 39:28.893
And me?

39:30.708 --> 39:32.251
And me?!

39:34.588 --> 39:36.960
You have won.

39:36.947 --> 39:39.320
You are also free to go.

39:57.626 --> 39:59.702
You will not stay for the wedding?

39:59.706 --> 40:04.581
Oh, a six-day wedding?
You know, we really should get back.

40:05.186 --> 40:07.012
It is a joyous time.

40:07.027 --> 40:10.443
But we all wish you and Nya
many years of happiness,

40:10.385 --> 40:12.673
and many sons, too.

40:13.664 --> 40:15.289
And daughters.

40:23.543 --> 40:26.213
<i>All Shavadai... be free!</i>

40:37.342 --> 40:41.422
It is how you will be remembered, Carter.

40:55.661 --> 40:59.077
<i>Will this new anaesthesia
be a miracle drug on Earth?</i>

40:59.021 --> 41:04.063
<i>If it is, somebody else will get the
credit. We can't say where it came from.</i>

41:03.940 --> 41:08.188
<i>Damn. I guess I'm gonna
have to cancel that Oprah interview.</i>

41:08.099 --> 41:10.175
<i>What is an "Oprah"?</i>
