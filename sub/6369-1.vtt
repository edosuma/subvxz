00:14.082 --> 00:15.816
Man:
This is Thomas Jefferson,

00:15.849 --> 00:18.619
founding father
of my adopted home
of America,

00:18.652 --> 00:20.588
which I love
with all my heart.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.557
But then, fuck, he had
to go and write that line,

00:23.591 --> 00:26.360
"Life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness."

00:26.394 --> 00:29.697
Life, sure.
Liberty, I understand
the basic concept.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.700
But happiness?
I mean, what the fuck
is happiness?

00:32.733 --> 00:35.769
A BMW?
1,000 Facebook friends?

00:35.803 --> 00:38.372
A million Twitter followers?
I wish he had been more honest.

00:38.406 --> 00:41.642
I wish he had just said,
"Life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness,

00:41.675 --> 00:43.577
whatever the fuck
that is."

00:43.611 --> 00:45.179
Just don't keep us
guessing, Tom.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.381
Guessing and pursuing
and failing.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.383
Fuck you,
Thomas Jefferson!

00:49.417 --> 00:53.121
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

00:53.154 --> 00:55.623
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

00:55.656 --> 00:58.526
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

00:58.559 --> 01:01.362
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

01:01.395 --> 01:04.498
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands. *

01:05.766 --> 01:09.670
Group:
* Happy birthday to you

01:09.703 --> 01:13.807
* Happy birthday
to you *

01:13.841 --> 01:19.680
* You look like a monkey

01:19.713 --> 01:25.519
* And you smell
like one, too. *

01:26.454 --> 01:28.522
( cheering )

01:31.259 --> 01:34.562
The game is half over, people.
The race is half run.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.430
- Here we go.
- Speech, speech.

01:36.464 --> 01:40.768
Well, "They give birth
astride a grave,

01:40.801 --> 01:42.803
the light gleams
an instant,

01:42.836 --> 01:44.705
then it is night
once more."

01:44.738 --> 01:47.708
Half run?
Buddy, you're
gonna be lucky

01:47.741 --> 01:49.843
if you make it
to the end of the week.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.912
She's right, Dad.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.448
44, that's like a million.

01:54.482 --> 01:57.285
- Whoo!
- Hey, hey, Mom is--

01:57.318 --> 01:58.852
Mom's almost
as old as me.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.554
But Mom's pretty.

02:00.588 --> 02:05.193
- Thanks, Jules, so much.
- Oh! Give it up.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.461
- Oh, manners, mister.
- Wait, get, get--

02:07.495 --> 02:10.398
Yeah, have some manners
like the adults.
Right, Julius?

02:10.431 --> 02:12.566
( laughing )

02:12.600 --> 02:14.235
Num, num, num!

02:15.703 --> 02:17.538
I have that one.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.541
I have, like,
five of that one.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.476
Mine are
pretty good, though.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.178
Mine came in a set,

02:24.212 --> 02:26.947
so I also have
the Dragon Copter

02:26.980 --> 02:28.916
and Sensei Wu.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.952
Yours is junk.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.923
Hey, hey, you know
what I've noticed
about your kid?

02:37.725 --> 02:40.594
- He's an asshole.
- Yes, he's a fucking asshole.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.631
- I don't know how
that happened, but...
- So it's not just Julius?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.966
No, no, he's an asshole
to everybody. Kids hate him.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.437
He's an asshole because
his father was an asshole.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.971
Still.
Your ex is still
an asshole.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.707
An asshole doesn't fall
far from the tree.

02:53.741 --> 02:57.645
- He'll grow out of it.
- I don't think that's the kind
of assholeness you outgrow.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.615
We're just hoping for,
you know, an average prick.
Just a run-of-the-mill dick.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.852
I don't know, Thom.
Couple years from now,
Jules could be an asshole, too.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.755
I don't think so.
A pussy, maybe.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.524
Well, I would rather have
an asshole than a pussy.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.926
It is tough
out there, people.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.229
Asshole's not
a bad way to go.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.998
- Not a bad way to go.
- Come on, lady.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.269
- ( women laughing )
- Oh, my God.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.873
You ask me,
Julius is just too happy.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.676
- Too happy?
- You make a kid happy
in this world,

03:28.709 --> 03:30.411
you're setting them up.
That's child abuse.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.747
Trust me, Thom.
Your only shot at
happiness in this world

03:33.781 --> 03:37.017
is a miserable childhood.
The shittier the better.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.287
That's what I should
call my book.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.355
Yeah, "The Joy of Misery"
by Thom Payne.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.656
- A book?
- Yeah.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.025
- What's a book?
- Yeah, no shit.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.295
( women laugh )

03:47.328 --> 03:48.962
( crows cawing )

03:48.996 --> 03:51.565
It's okay.
They're watching "Frozen."

03:51.599 --> 03:53.534
See? Pussy.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.569
Speaking of pussies,

03:55.603 --> 03:56.837
Monica is getting
hers done.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.839
- Her what?
- Her pussy.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.309
- Done?
- Tightened.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.377
- What the fuck
are you talking about?
- What?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.979
She's 37,
she's done having kids,
she wants a tighter cooch.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.915
That's bullshit.
That's totally for Jason.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.783
I don't know.
My sister had three kids.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.419
She said she can park
her car up in there now.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.288
- But like a Smart car.
- The girl drives a Hummer.

04:14.322 --> 04:17.057
Wait a minute.
I want to get
this straight.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.793
Her pussy is good enough
for him to fuck,

04:19.827 --> 04:21.529
good enough
for him to eat,

04:21.562 --> 04:23.531
good enough
to bear his child,

04:23.564 --> 04:24.965
now he just wants
it tighter?

04:24.998 --> 04:26.800
Think he should
just go fuck himself.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.602
Can he say how tight
he wants it?

04:28.636 --> 04:29.870
Well, she's at
a beer can now.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.705
So he probably wants,
what, a shot glass?

04:31.739 --> 04:33.006
He looks like
a pencil dick to me.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.675
Maybe she should
just go with sharpener.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.943
( laughing )

04:35.976 --> 04:39.079
Could he go in the surgery
and, you know, like test
the vagina?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.815
Yo, Doc, you're close,
but can you give it
another turn or two?

04:41.849 --> 04:45.353
- Oh, my God.
- Mr. Lesko, I got it down
to a 22-year-old.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.688
Legally, I can only
go to an 18.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.590
Hey, Doc,
while you're down there,

04:49.623 --> 04:51.559
can you loosen up
her shithole?

04:51.592 --> 04:54.462
- ( laughter )
- Okay, they're coming.
They're coming.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.398
Where's the joint?

04:58.766 --> 05:01.902
Thom:
"George was a very,
very good monkey.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.605
He was also
very curious."

05:04.638 --> 05:07.775
And he was a real
pain in the butt.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.910
- Dad.
- He deserved
a good slap,

05:09.943 --> 05:11.779
somebody to teach
him a lesson.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.847
"You can't just steal
a spaceship

05:13.881 --> 05:15.583
and fly it to the moon,
monkey boy."

05:15.616 --> 05:17.718
Dad, read it normal.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.788
Hey, hey.
I love you, buddy.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.756
You're old.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.759
I'm not old.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm--

05:25.793 --> 05:27.761
I'm oldish.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.830
Are you going to die?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.901
Am I gonna die?
Boy...

05:39.172 --> 05:41.909
You know,

05:41.942 --> 05:44.412
the truth is, Julius,
I am going to die,

05:44.445 --> 05:48.048
but not for a very,
very long time.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.818
( high-pitched )
First I got to start
speaking like this.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.086
- ( giggling )
- And then I got to start
losing my teeth.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.390
- Then I got to start
pooping in my diapers.
- ( squealing )

05:58.526 --> 06:00.127
Hey, how about tomorrow

06:00.160 --> 06:03.664
we get burgers at Five Guys,
then Funny Farm?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.033
Yes.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.035
Low.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.538
Okay.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.806
You know the drill.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.083
- ( woman moaning on laptop )
- Man: You like that? Yeah.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.185
Woman:
Oh, yeah, baby.
Fuck my ass.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.187
There we go.
In through the out door.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.922
Come on,
take it seriously.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.191
- She's in agony.
- ( laughs )

06:31.224 --> 06:34.862
- She's faking it.
- No, she is not
faking it.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.731
There's a gigantic cock
shoved up her asshole.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.133
Hang on, you can't say
that she's faking
the pleasure,

06:40.167 --> 06:42.135
but she's not faking it
when it's pain.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.972
You got to be consistent.
I was watching that.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.940
Oh, I think it's easier
to fake pleasure.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.742
Yeah?
Well, that's reassuring.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.077
( laughs )

06:50.110 --> 06:52.212
Is this a birthday
present or what?

06:52.245 --> 06:55.182
Porno, shaved pussies.

07:00.220 --> 07:04.024
You know,
I read something about
Alzheimer's the other day.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.094
( sighs )
Are we gonna fuck?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.597
It said that not sleeping
could be an indicator

07:09.630 --> 07:11.499
of early-onset
Alzheimer's.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.166
Are we gonna fuck?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.968
So now I can't sleep
because I'm worried

07:15.002 --> 07:16.236
that my not sleeping
means I have Alzheimer's.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.905
I mean, why are they
telling me this?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.240
Is it the not sleeping
that causes Alzheimer's

07:20.273 --> 07:22.510
or Alzheimer's
that makes you not sleep?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.978
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do
with that information.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.147
( clears throat )

07:27.180 --> 07:29.650
Do you think my pussy
needs tightening?

07:29.683 --> 07:31.519
What?

07:31.552 --> 07:35.589
I thought maybe
it would be better
for you if it was tighter.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.858
Oh, baby, baby, listen.
Come here. Hey.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.727
Why bother
with you at all?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.995
I could just
get a bottle of wine
and a blood pressure cuff.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.931
- ( laughs )
- You know, baby?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.666
It's not--
honey, it's not you.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.901
It's the fucking Prozac.
It's a hard-on killer.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.904
Why don't we
just try a Viagra?

07:50.938 --> 07:52.640
They're a client, right?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.775
Keebler gives you
all those fucking cookies.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.546
I'm worried the Viagra will
interfere with the Prozac,
you know?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.147
That's life.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.083
You know, happy and soft
or miserable and hard.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.286
I would be totally fine
with miserable and hard.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.623
- ( laughs )
- Just for the record,
if you--

08:09.657 --> 08:11.825
Julius:
Mom!

08:11.859 --> 08:14.094
( sighs )

08:14.127 --> 08:16.029
- We're not fucking.
- We're not fucking.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.298
- ( groans )
- Mom!

08:18.331 --> 08:20.568
Coming, honey.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.071
You know, I used
to like shaved pussies.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.673
Oh, here we go.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.575
But now whenever I see them,
all I can think of

08:27.608 --> 08:29.910
is that fucking
Vietnamese girl
running down the street

08:29.943 --> 08:31.545
covered in napalm.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.246
I can barely
watch porn anymore.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.783
That is the real tragedy
of chemical warfare.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.251
- Julius: Mom!
- I'm right here, sweetheart.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.722
Hey, can you not read Julius
"Curious George" before bed?

08:41.755 --> 08:43.323
He's terrified
of the Man in the Yellow Hat.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.593
He's fearful.
He's a fearful child.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.961
No, you're fearful.
He's six.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.730
I'm fearful
that he's fearful.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.565
( groans )

08:52.600 --> 08:53.834
( sighs )

08:53.867 --> 08:55.636
Fucking asshole.

08:56.970 --> 09:00.040
( train whistle blows )

09:03.176 --> 09:05.946
Check it out.
Steve Jobs' book.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.948
- Read it.
- You read the hardcover.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.482
I read the hardcover
and the paperback.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.252
This is the Kindle
version of the paperback
of the hardcover.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.087
- No way.
- Way.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.223
Wanted to read the new format
before the movie came out.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.291
90 pages of new material.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.361
So, it's the night before
the launch of the iPod.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.731
Jobs goes down to the factory
to check things out,

09:23.764 --> 09:26.299
- only he doesn't
like the sound.
- What sound?

09:26.333 --> 09:29.002
- The headphone jack sound.
- The click?

09:29.036 --> 09:31.705
The sound.
He wants a better sound.

09:31.739 --> 09:36.143
So he gets a team
of 100 engineers to work
all night to replace them.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.377
- 100?
- All night.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.112
Guy was a genius.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.615
Guy was
a fucking genius.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.916
( train whistle blows )

09:42.950 --> 09:45.252
Thom:
Which brings me back
to Thomas Jefferson.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.254
Thomas Jefferson
isn't the problem.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.657
Jefferson was trying
to help.

09:49.690 --> 09:53.293
It's me.
I'm the fucking problem.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.996
My name is Thomas Payne
and I...

09:56.029 --> 09:59.867
( sounds overlapping )

09:59.900 --> 10:02.169
Thom:
I work for Satan.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.872
I've worked for the Dark Lord
for 20 years now

10:04.905 --> 10:07.941
and so I say this with
a fair degree of authority,

10:07.975 --> 10:09.409
fuck "Mad Men."

10:09.442 --> 10:12.012
There's nothing cool
about advertising.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.413
There's nothing
interesting.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.215
We do the same thing
that everyone else

10:15.248 --> 10:16.416
in the world does
these days.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.418
We kiss
the zit-covered asses

10:18.451 --> 10:21.054
of arrogant,
know-nothing teenagers.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.060
It's "Lord of the Flies"
out there, folks.

10:27.094 --> 10:30.998
And everyone over 18
is Piggy.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.768
Woman:
I'm fucked, Thom.
We all are.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.303
When did he make
this announcement?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.038
This morning.
Do you know them?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.040
I know of them.
They're the Swedes.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.843
- That's what
everyone calls them.
- Gustaf and Gottfrid.

10:42.876 --> 10:46.179
So, what, Jonathan
just announces these
new creative directors,

10:46.213 --> 10:47.380
calls you into his office
and fires you?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.050
No, but they will.
I know it.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.920
Debbie, you're the best
account director
this company has.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.387
( scoffs )
I could be their mother.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.056
That doesn't mean
they want to fire you.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.190
It means they want
to fuck you.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.692
Oh, they're gonna
fuck me.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.393
Trust me,
they are gonna fuck me!

11:00.427 --> 11:02.062
They're not gonna fire you.
I won't let them.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.197
You don't have any power.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.933
I have some power.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.134
Not anymore.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.802
So why are you
bitching to me?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.403
Because you have heart.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.205
And that's why
you have no power.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.241
( knocks )
Jonathan wants
to see you at 12:00.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.076
Am I being fired?

11:16.109 --> 11:18.712
Mikal phoned,
wants to know
if he's being fired.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.480
Tracey phoned, wants to know
if she's being fired.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.816
Larry phoned,
wants to know
if you're being fired.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.818
- It's gonna be a fun day.
- You know what? Fuck this.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.720
- Tell Jonathan
I want to see him now.
- I'll tell Jonathan

11:26.754 --> 11:28.288
you want to see him
now regardless of prior
schedule commitments.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.823
I don't care which
Swedish dick he's sucking.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.258
What is that,
some kind of Radar thing?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.260
She's been with me
way too long.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.429
- Radar?
- O'Reilly.
From "MASH."

11:36.463 --> 11:37.898
What's "MASH"?

11:37.931 --> 11:40.267
Oh, my God.
How old aren't you?

11:40.300 --> 11:43.236
Can you do a 5:30
face-to-face with
Gustaf and Gottfrid?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.305
Who schedules
a meeting at 5:30?

11:45.338 --> 11:48.141
- Gustaf and Gottfrid.
- Maybe they're still
on Swedish time?

11:48.175 --> 11:51.879
Well, I promised
Jules I'd take him
to Five Guys tonight.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.346
Okay.

11:55.282 --> 11:59.319
Fuck it!
All right, tell them
I'll be there.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.454
Got it.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.123
Reporter:
The Charlie Hebdo shootings

12:03.156 --> 12:05.058
suggest a new al-Qaeda,
experts say.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.393
You got to hand it
to bin Laden.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.196
What'd he spend on 9/11?
Couple hundred grand?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.865
I couldn't make
a Web film for that much.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.802
Al-Qaeda's been
on the cover of every
magazine ever since.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.270
9/10, no one ever
heard of that brand.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.339
9/12, not a person
alive who hadn't.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.042
ISIS comes along,
expands the market
to the West.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.945
- Women are joining that group.
Did you know that?
- Yeah.

12:24.978 --> 12:28.148
These homicidal
motherfuckers are
fantastic marketers.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.017
Al-Qaeda is not
a brand, Jonathan.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.551
It's a terrorist
organization.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.021
Everything's a brand, Thom.
I'm a brand, you're a brand.

12:34.054 --> 12:37.324
- God's a brand.
And a brand in trouble.
- ( TV turns off )

12:38.258 --> 12:39.960
Are you getting fired?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.461
Things have changed, Thom.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.031
Thinking is not
as important as tweeting.

12:44.064 --> 12:48.802
Gustaf and Gottfrid have
thousands of followers
and you're on AOL.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.839
Sorry, am I getting
fired for not having
a Facebook account?

12:51.872 --> 12:54.107
You test poorly, Thom.
You taste great,

12:54.141 --> 12:56.109
but it's
a less filling world.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.979
Your clothes suck,
you're out of shape.
You're 44.

12:59.012 --> 13:02.182
Fuck you,
you 52-year-old,

13:02.215 --> 13:03.984
skinny jeans-wearing
asshole.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.452
Executive level, Thom.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.520
The City of Refuge
for the bespectacled

13:07.554 --> 13:10.123
lumpenproles
of the 50-plus crowd.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.393
The board has given
the Swedes control of
the creative department.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.096
- They want
to turn things around.
- I have to report to them?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.531
Jesus Christ, Thom.
The industry is in
the shitter.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.100
You know that.
They all are.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.334
We've hit peak America.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.070
We're sitting
in a puddle of was.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.306
In a couple of months,
I expect to be replaced
by a fucking app.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.544
Look, I love you, Thom,

13:31.578 --> 13:34.614
but if you want
to survive this,

13:34.647 --> 13:37.284
you've got
to play the game.

13:37.317 --> 13:42.189
So marketer,
rebrand thyself.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.160
Thom:
There must be
somewhere I can go.

13:47.194 --> 13:50.130
Where do you want to go?
You want to go to some
fucking digital company

13:50.163 --> 13:53.033
where you're coming up
with shitty Facebook
ideas all day?

13:53.066 --> 13:56.403
They won't touch you.
Do you know that
the average age

13:56.436 --> 13:59.239
of the Facebook
employee is 26?

13:59.272 --> 14:02.175
31 at Google.
33 at Apple.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.544
You stay at MGT.
Kiss some Nordic ass.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.314
Write your fucking novel.
And I'm a headhunter.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.882
I lose money
telling you this shit.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.318
You still need
a copywriter, right?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.386
Did you check out
Gwen's portfolio?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.922
She's a fucking genius.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.991
Great work for Geico gecko
and the Aflac goose.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.426
It's a duck,
by the way.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.395
Oh, now, that's
even funnier.
( laughs )

14:22.429 --> 14:24.531
I just think,
I don't know,

14:24.564 --> 14:29.069
I'd be happier
someplace else.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.670
That's a myth, Thom.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.406
You're as happy right now
as you can ever be.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.675
We each have our own
joy ceiling.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.478
It doesn't matter how much
fucking money you have

14:38.511 --> 14:40.313
or how perfect
your family is

14:40.347 --> 14:42.282
or how many Pulitzers
you win.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.684
You hit your joy ceiling
and you're done.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.188
That's why Jesus wept.
Low joy ceiling.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.924
Richard Simmons,
high joy ceiling.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.625
And that fucking monk,
what's his name?

14:52.659 --> 14:55.495
Thich Nhat
whatever the fuck,
very high joy ceiling.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.631
Thom Payne,
low joy ceiling.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.634
It's not the pursuit
of happiness that's
our problem.

15:01.668 --> 15:05.472
It's our inability to accept
when we have maxed out.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.307
You think
you're not happy?

15:07.340 --> 15:11.378
Trust me, Thom, you couldn't
possibly be happier.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.470
Forta-Dude.

15:37.504 --> 15:42.409
"Get amped and ripped
as you max out those reps
like never before."

15:42.442 --> 15:44.211
Jesus, fuck.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.346
Man:
Okay, Thom Payne.

15:46.379 --> 15:51.218
By show of hands,
how many of you find
Thom likable?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.752
( group laughs )

15:52.785 --> 15:55.022
Does anybody here
find Thom likable?

15:55.055 --> 15:57.991
- ( group laughs )
- Nobody? Interesting.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.493
How many of you would like
to be like Thom someday?

16:00.527 --> 16:03.163
- Man: Hell, no.
- Hey, let me ask you this.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.499
How many of you think
Thom should just kill himself?

16:06.533 --> 16:09.436
- That's a yes.
- Why?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.372
Because I don't look
like this shithead?

16:12.405 --> 16:15.442
I'm not supposed
to look like that.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.411
I have a job,
a wife, and a child.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.148
Do you know how much time

16:21.181 --> 16:24.584
this ridiculous asshole
spends to look like that?

16:24.617 --> 16:26.353
Hours every fucking day.

16:26.386 --> 16:30.457
Do you know how much
self-loathing it requires
to have washboard abs?

16:30.490 --> 16:34.794
How much you've got
to hate yourself to work
that fucking hard?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.730
Abs don't tell the world
you're healthy.

16:37.764 --> 16:42.169
They tell the world
you're one Twinkie away
from killing yourself.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.137
It's true.
I hate myself.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.207
I pursue
an impossible standard
of physical perfection

16:47.240 --> 16:49.076
in the hope it will
make me worthy of love.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.678
- Thank you.
- Again with the projection.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.713
Bitch projects like
a motherfucker, yo.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.183
Chill out, Thom.
Camus said Sisyphus

16:56.216 --> 16:58.218
was happy in his absurd
existence, a'ight?

16:58.251 --> 17:00.620
Camus also said that
the ridiculousness of life

17:00.653 --> 17:02.755
requires revolt,
not suicide.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.793
Okay, show of hands,
how many of you think Thom
is capable of revolt?

17:08.195 --> 17:10.563
- ( group snickers )
- Interesting.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.766
Mmm, interesting.
Go fuck yourselves.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.768
Nice tits, asshole.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.771
Lee:
Hey, honey, it's me.
It's about 4:00.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.841
Listen, don't worry about it.
Jules is gonna be fine.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.844
Fathers miss dinner
all the time.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.746
So why don't you
just get in there,

17:26.779 --> 17:30.450
tell those Swedes
how much you love IKEA

17:30.483 --> 17:32.752
and Douchen-Baggen
duvet covers

17:32.785 --> 17:37.524
and freestanding
Bergen-Belsen lamps,

17:37.557 --> 17:40.327
and we'll meet you
at the Funny Farm, okay?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.562
- I love you.
- ( sighs )

17:53.373 --> 17:55.442
( belches )

18:01.248 --> 18:03.516
( applause )

18:03.550 --> 18:05.418
( cheering )

18:05.452 --> 18:09.222
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:09.256 --> 18:13.760
Now, what we have
to do first is take a look
at all the accounts

18:13.793 --> 18:17.430
and say where can we be
doing the better work?

18:17.464 --> 18:22.435
Yeah? Where are
the opportunities
for disruption?

18:22.469 --> 18:24.637
For misruption?

18:24.671 --> 18:28.908
Business today travels
at the speed of ideas.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.179
And you don't
have to like it,
but you can't ignore it.

18:32.212 --> 18:36.183
First we had
the black and white, yeah?

18:36.216 --> 18:38.651
Then came color.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.853
What comes after color?

18:40.887 --> 18:43.323
You tell us.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.793
What would Steve Jobs do
with the Army account?

18:46.826 --> 18:49.662
Yeah? Or even at brands
like Keebler?

18:49.696 --> 18:53.933
How are we using
the social?

18:53.966 --> 18:57.270
Maybe it's time we shipped
the little elves off to Miami.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.673
- ( laughter )
- For a, uh, how do
you say it?

19:00.707 --> 19:02.409
( whispering )

19:02.442 --> 19:04.311
A forced retirement.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.679
( laughter )

19:06.713 --> 19:10.183
( mocking laughter )

19:11.651 --> 19:13.720
- Why?
- Why what?

19:13.753 --> 19:17.324
Why does Keebler need
a social media plan?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.826
Because
it isn't the '90s.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.829
- ( laughter )
- It's a cookie, Gustaf.

19:22.862 --> 19:26.333
- I'm Gottfrid.
- Oh, right, well,
you know, unfriend me.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.301
- ( laughter )
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.436
You know,
I bought some--

19:29.469 --> 19:31.471
excuse me--
Pepto-Bismol yesterday.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.341
That's what I get for eating
in the downstairs cafeteria.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.344
- ( laughter )
- And on the side
of the package

19:37.377 --> 19:40.347
- I swear it said,
"Follow us on Twitter."
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.651
Who the fuck wants to follow
Pepto-Bismol on Twitter?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.519
Are you that lonely?

19:46.553 --> 19:50.657
I mean, what the fuck
is wrong with your
fucking asshole

19:50.690 --> 19:54.261
that you need to follow
Pepto-Bismol on Twitter?

19:54.294 --> 19:57.230
What is it?
Is it like I need
to take a shit.

19:57.264 --> 20:01.668
Hmm, I wonder what's going on
in the pink bismuth world.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.938
- ( murmuring )
- ( man clearing throat )

20:05.972 --> 20:08.741
Look, Keebler had
its best year last year

20:08.775 --> 20:12.412
and old or not,
those elves are beloved
in this country.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.481
Gottfrid:
My grandparents
are beloved, too,

20:14.514 --> 20:18.285
- but I'm not going
to hire them, am I?
- ( laughter )

20:18.318 --> 20:21.488
Gottfrid, I don't think
we have enough money in
the budget for both of them.

20:21.521 --> 20:25.292
- ( laughter )
- That right there is something
that we need to change.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.427
This technophobia.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.830
I agree.
Why don't we fire
your grandparents?

20:30.863 --> 20:33.366
- Maybe, Thom.
- Maybe, maybe.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.835
I'm sorry, I'm feeling
a little strange.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.637
I'm gonna take
a lie-down.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.307
But if any of you
are Pinterested,

20:40.340 --> 20:43.976
you can follow
my fucking asshole
on Twitter.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.279
( murmuring )

20:46.313 --> 20:49.682
Okay,
some strong opinions.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.418
( laughter )

20:51.451 --> 20:54.854
( gunshots )

20:54.887 --> 20:57.957
Fuck!
What the fuck?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.063
Thom:
Fast Eddie.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.165
( gunshot )

21:10.036 --> 21:11.904
Ernie?

21:13.740 --> 21:15.342
Ernie?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.577
Hold it right there.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.347
Ernie, what the hell
are you doing?

21:20.380 --> 21:22.014
46 years, Thom.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.817
46 fucking years
I gave that company

21:24.851 --> 21:26.819
living in this
fucking tree, Thom.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.688
And now they're
going to fire me?

21:28.721 --> 21:30.957
Well, not if I
kill us all first.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.426
Ernie, Ernie,
no one's gonna fire you.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.828
- I won't let them.
- You fucking pussy.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.730
You'll be lucky
if they don't fire you.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.733
Ernie, what about
JJ and Buckets?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.101
And Elmer?
Little Elmer.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.437
Doesn't Elmer
deserve a father?

21:44.471 --> 21:46.906
A father who takes it up
the ass his whole life.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.609
Shit, they might as well
just move in with you.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.845
No, no, no, stop.
We can make this
right, Ernie.

21:52.879 --> 21:56.849
We can make it right.
Like-- like Steve Jobs.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.718
Like Steve what?

21:58.751 --> 22:01.053
The jack.
The iPod jack.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.756
He wanted to make
a bad situation right,

22:03.790 --> 22:05.858
so he had 100 engineers

22:05.892 --> 22:08.528
fix every single one
and work all night.

22:08.561 --> 22:11.531
Just to make
it right, Ernie.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.600
They worked all night?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.134
All night, buddy.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.137
He sounds like
a fucking prick.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.874
- ( gunshot )
- ( screams )

22:21.908 --> 22:24.544
- Ma!
- Oh, my Ernie.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.646
My Ernie.
Oh, no.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.481
- So sorry.
- ( sobbing ) No!

22:28.515 --> 22:30.550
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.084
Oh!

22:32.118 --> 22:34.787
( moaning )

22:36.656 --> 22:39.426
Oh, my stars!

22:39.459 --> 22:42.028
So soft.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.896
So chewy.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.966
Oh, Thom.
What are you doing?

22:46.999 --> 22:51.103
Oh, Thom.
Thom, I have waited
so long for this.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.640
Oh, my, Thom.

22:53.673 --> 22:56.909
That's uncommonly good.
Ooh!

22:56.943 --> 23:00.112
You're double-stuffed.
( moaning )

23:00.146 --> 23:02.715
You're so fucking
double-stuffed. Huh?

23:02.749 --> 23:05.718
- Thom?
- You gonna take
your teeth out, hmm?

23:05.752 --> 23:08.888
Ahem, Thom,
they canceled.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.659
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.727
- I'm late.
- They canceled.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.663
- Jules?
- The Swedes.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.865
Oh, motherfuckers!

23:19.766 --> 23:22.802
( children playing )

23:22.835 --> 23:25.938
Julius, want to go
down the slide, honey?

23:25.972 --> 23:28.741
No, I don't want
to go down.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.878
Okay, you don't--
you don't have to go
down the slide

23:31.911 --> 23:34.146
if you don't want to.
Don't do it for me, honey.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.583
If you don't
want to go down,
don't go down.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.954
My Alexander
used to be like that.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.524
Now he goes down
headfirst.

23:45.858 --> 23:48.227
- Used to be like what?
- What?

23:48.260 --> 23:51.598
You said your son
used to be like that.
Be like what?

23:51.631 --> 23:53.232
Oh, just, you know.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.067
Why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

23:56.936 --> 23:59.639
Jules, just--
just come on down.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.608
We're here
to have fun.

24:01.641 --> 24:04.511
- I was just
trying to be helpful.
- No, you weren't.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.846
You were
trying to be superior
at the Funny Farm.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.849
- It's fucking pathetic.
- ( phone rings )

24:09.882 --> 24:11.851
Hi.

24:11.884 --> 24:15.121
- They canceled.
- Are you kidding me?

24:15.154 --> 24:18.057
- Oh, this is bullshit, Thom.
- There's nothing I can do.

24:18.090 --> 24:21.193
Oh, well, they don't have
families, they don't have kids,
why would they give a shit?

24:21.227 --> 24:24.664
They are fucking kids.
I still can't tell them
to fuck off.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.099
Thom, it's fucking
bullshit.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.136
How's Julius?

24:30.169 --> 24:32.672
Is he just sitting there
doing nothing?

24:32.705 --> 24:34.240
No, he's having
a great time.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.546
Let me talk to him.

24:39.579 --> 24:40.913
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.650
It's Dada.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.652
Hi, Dada.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.086
Hey, buddy boy.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.522
What's going on?
You having fun?

24:49.556 --> 24:50.890
Not really.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.760
Hey, Dad,
your balloon is dying.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.562
The red one
from your party.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.830
Thom:
Hey, I'll get you
a new one, I promise.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.533
And, hey,

25:00.567 --> 25:03.302
I'm really sorry
I wasn't there today, okay?

25:03.335 --> 25:05.705
Sure, I know.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.239
Next week, I promise.

25:07.273 --> 25:11.310
Okay, we'll go next week.
Bye, Dada.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.112
Bye, buddy.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.161
Jonathan?

25:50.783 --> 25:53.019
( sniffing )
Martini?

25:53.052 --> 25:56.989
( sniffing )
A little dirty.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.358
( sniffing )
Vodka. Vodka?

25:59.391 --> 26:02.361
Gin. Face-to-face
with the Swedes

26:02.394 --> 26:04.964
down at the bar cleaning up
your fucking mess.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.833
You can't remember
their names, can you?

26:06.866 --> 26:09.368
- Fuck you, Thom.
- Excuse me?

26:09.401 --> 26:12.772
'Tis pity
we're all whores,
isn't it, Thom?

26:12.805 --> 26:14.106
Everyone but you.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.843
I must say, that was
a stirring oratory

26:16.876 --> 26:21.147
you delivered earlier on
the rights of animated elves.

26:22.281 --> 26:25.785
You suck the same cocks
we all do, Thom.

26:25.818 --> 26:29.121
Wincing at the taste
doesn't make you
a better man,

26:29.155 --> 26:31.658
it only makes you
a worse whore.

26:31.691 --> 26:35.862
So if you're gonna show me
the error of my ways,

26:35.895 --> 26:39.265
do it from the cedar deck
of your four-bedroom,

26:39.298 --> 26:41.267
two-and-a-half-bath
American dream

26:41.300 --> 26:43.770
that you earned
the same way I earned mine.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.306
You should drink more, Jon.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.677
I couldn't possibly.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.825
( whispering )
What's that?

27:38.858 --> 27:40.793
That's just balloons.

27:40.827 --> 27:44.030
Oh, thank you, you dick.
I meant in the bag.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.934
Oh, that's
some champagne.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.736
Hmm.

27:49.769 --> 27:53.139
And 50mg of hard-on.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.842
Are we fucking?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.476
Yes, we're fucking.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.212
"Chemical cock."
My favorite.

28:00.246 --> 28:03.382
Except I took
some 20 minutes ago
and nothing's happened.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.017
Oh, no, wait.
There it is.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.153
- Stand back.
- Yeah, mmm.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.488
Whoa.
( laughs )

28:09.521 --> 28:12.124
- Our safe word is "Swede."
- Let's do it.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.360
- Yeah.
- Imagine the scenario...

28:14.393 --> 28:16.262
Thom:
Sometimes
on the way to work,

28:16.295 --> 28:19.265
I like to imagine
Samuel Beckett

28:19.298 --> 28:21.433
waiting for,
let's say,

28:21.467 --> 28:24.403
the 6:47 to Grand Central.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.039
And Sam's pissed off.
He hates his job.

28:27.073 --> 28:30.176
Wants to write,
wants to do something
that matters.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.879
But he does
his shitty job every day

28:32.912 --> 28:35.782
because Sam loves his wife
and they love their child.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.384
And somehow Sam's found
a sliver of happiness

28:38.417 --> 28:40.452
in this shitpile
of a world.

28:40.486 --> 28:43.189
So basically,
Sam's fucked.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.358
( clamoring )

28:50.229 --> 28:51.998
My apologies.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.533
Thom:
Because if he wants
to keep that happiness,

28:54.566 --> 28:57.469
Sam's got to suck
some cock.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.906
The same cocks we all do.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.475
So Beckett takes
his seat on the train,

29:03.509 --> 29:06.078
fires up his iPad
and he thinks,

29:06.112 --> 29:10.182
"I can't go on.
I'll go on to Target.

29:10.216 --> 29:13.085
It's 30% off
all skinny jeans

29:13.119 --> 29:15.154
till next
motherfucking Monday."

29:15.187 --> 29:18.490
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

29:18.524 --> 29:21.193
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

29:21.227 --> 29:24.096
* If you're happy and you

29:24.130 --> 29:26.833

29:26.866 --> 29:29.301
* If you're happy and you

* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

29:32.204 --> 29:35.074
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

29:35.107 --> 29:37.810
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

29:37.844 --> 29:40.512
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

29:40.546 --> 29:43.249
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

29:43.282 --> 29:46.085
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

29:46.118 --> 29:48.855
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

29:48.888 --> 29:52.091
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands. *
