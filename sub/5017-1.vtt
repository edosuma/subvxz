<i>I've heard people say
that life is like a river.</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:48.196
<i>And we're all
just tiny minnows</i>

00:48.198 --> 00:52.634
<i>struggling through the freeze,
the thaw and the flow.</i>

00:54.803 --> 00:57.070
<i>Sometimes it's
a momentous event,</i>

00:57.072 --> 01:01.675
<i>a birth or a death that
causes the currents to shift.</i>

01:03.352 --> 01:05.906
<i>And sometimes it's
something as simple</i>

01:05.928 --> 01:08.690
<i>as your best friend going
home early one night.</i>

01:20.259 --> 01:21.793
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:21.795 --> 01:25.163
What is wrong with me for
ever fucking being with you!

01:25.165 --> 01:27.965
- Listen...
- You make me so mad!

01:27.967 --> 01:30.234
Will you listen to me? Please.

01:30.236 --> 01:33.003
Sleep in the
fucking greenhouse.

02:10.003 --> 02:11.805
Dad.

02:11.807 --> 02:14.573
Hey! Look who's still up.

02:14.575 --> 02:16.475
Where's your best bud Teddy?

02:16.477 --> 02:18.110
He went home hours ago.

02:18.112 --> 02:19.478
He did, huh?

02:19.813 --> 02:21.814
Here, sit down. Join me.

02:21.816 --> 02:23.181
Take a load off, my man.

02:23.183 --> 02:24.816
Okay.

02:24.818 --> 02:28.011
- I bet you're wondering why Mom
has me out here, huh? - Mmm.

02:28.303 --> 02:31.623
Well, can I tell you
something, hmm?

02:31.625 --> 02:34.691
I'd like to talk
to another guy.

02:35.059 --> 02:37.661
You know mommy's friend,
Mrs. Donahue,

02:37.663 --> 02:39.096
did you know she's pregnant?

02:39.098 --> 02:41.331
Hmm? She's gonna have a baby.

02:41.333 --> 02:42.431
Oh.

02:42.433 --> 02:45.334
The trouble is you know
who made her pregnant?

02:48.338 --> 02:49.639
Me.

02:49.641 --> 02:50.873
Mmm.

02:51.641 --> 02:52.540
Is Mom pissed?

02:52.542 --> 02:55.977
She is. I mean,
she's really pissed.

02:55.979 --> 02:58.013
She doesn't think she wants
to be married to me anymore

02:58.015 --> 02:59.648
and now she's gonna be even
more pissed that I told you,

02:59.650 --> 03:02.416
but I think, you know, you
deserve to know the truth.

03:02.418 --> 03:03.984
You're a big guy now.

03:04.152 --> 03:06.520
What's gonna happen
to the baby?

03:07.288 --> 03:09.723
Some babies are never
born at all, you know?

03:09.725 --> 03:12.058
And some babies are born,
their parents take care of 'em,

03:12.060 --> 03:15.094
some babies, you know,
somebody else raises 'em.

03:15.096 --> 03:16.129
You know, like, uh...

03:16.131 --> 03:19.065
What's that stupid TV show you
always watch with your sister?

03:19.067 --> 03:22.234
With the two little black kids
and the rich white guy.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.468
<i>Oh, Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

03:23.470 --> 03:24.970
Right, okay. Well
they're adopted, right?

03:24.972 --> 03:27.406
So, you know all
about that, right?

03:27.408 --> 03:28.273
I mean, that's...

03:28.275 --> 03:30.207
That's another thing I've
been wanting to tell you,

03:30.209 --> 03:31.575
you know, but
your mom's like...

03:31.577 --> 03:35.279
You know, it's
gotta be the perfect time.

03:36.549 --> 03:40.316
But I think that you should
know, you know?

03:40.885 --> 03:41.851
Know what?

03:41.853 --> 03:43.953
The truth about your life.

03:43.955 --> 03:44.721
You're adopted.

03:44.723 --> 03:47.657
It's not a big deal.
I mean Aristotle was adopted.

03:47.659 --> 03:49.124
Lee Majors, you know him,

03:49.126 --> 03:51.674
The Six Million Dollar Man, right?
He was adopted.

03:51.929 --> 03:55.631
Tons of people are adopted
and you wouldn't even know it.

03:55.816 --> 03:57.800
Yeah, so...

03:58.201 --> 03:59.867
I mean, there it is.

04:00.602 --> 04:03.638
Does that mean
Mr. Donahue is my dad?

04:03.640 --> 04:05.039
No!

04:05.041 --> 04:06.307
Champ, come here.

04:06.309 --> 04:07.375
Come here, come
here, come here.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.875
I'm your dad for
crying out loud.

04:08.877 --> 04:10.944
I'll be your dad forever.
Get up here.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.879
Get up here.

04:12.881 --> 04:14.781
Can I sleep
here with you, Dad?

04:14.783 --> 04:16.750
Oh, I'd love that.
Mmm.

04:17.052 --> 04:20.820
But I think your mom's pissed
enough at me, don't you?

04:20.822 --> 04:24.423
So get your butt
back in bed, huh.

04:25.827 --> 04:29.127
You'll be here
in the morning, right?

04:31.230 --> 04:34.466
Mmm, we'll see what
tomorrow brings.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.578
<i>I often wondered</i>

04:48.580 --> 04:51.214
<i>if Teddy hadn't left
so early that night,</i>

04:51.216 --> 04:55.618
<i>maybe I would never have had
that conversation with my dad.</i>

04:56.053 --> 05:00.021
<i>Maybe our lives would have
stayed secure and naive.</i>

05:01.290 --> 05:04.192
<i>Maybe we would never
have met Eliza.</i>

05:05.294 --> 05:07.995
<i>Maybe this whole story
would never have happened.</i>

05:14.302 --> 05:15.436
Oh, fuck!

05:24.345 --> 05:26.345
Oh, God damn it, Teddy.

05:27.947 --> 05:29.481
Okay. Okay.

05:31.217 --> 05:32.050
Thanks, man.

05:32.052 --> 05:34.886
Jesus, we have
a front door, you know.

05:34.888 --> 05:36.254
Uh, yeah, yeah.

05:37.890 --> 05:39.023
Guess what?

05:39.025 --> 05:42.393
- What?
- My mom took off again.

05:42.395 --> 05:43.161
Shit.

05:43.163 --> 05:44.327
She got shit faced last night

05:44.329 --> 05:45.862
and then when I woke up
in the morning

05:45.864 --> 05:48.665
her and all her stuff
were just gone.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.867
Well, I mean she'll come back.

05:50.869 --> 05:51.601
She always does.

05:51.603 --> 05:54.436
Yeah, well, fuck it.
I don't even care.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.839
I'm all about trying
to get to New York now.

05:56.841 --> 05:58.674
My brother had the right idea.

05:58.676 --> 06:00.943
Well, I'm all about
getting some weed.

06:00.945 --> 06:04.312
It's New Year's Eve
and we're bone dry.

06:05.548 --> 06:08.817
Hey, Prudence, can
I borrow 40 bucks?

06:08.819 --> 06:10.752
What happened to
your glasses, Teddy?

06:10.754 --> 06:11.653
I got contacts.

06:11.655 --> 06:14.454
Oh, you looked better
with glasses.

06:19.627 --> 06:23.262
My, uh, my brother, he was
telling me about this college.

06:23.264 --> 06:24.931
It's like, right
next to CBGB's.

06:24.933 --> 06:26.732
It's free, it's just
really hard to get in.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.802
You know colleg is gonna suck
just as much as high school.

06:29.804 --> 06:31.270
Yeah, but we'll
be in New York.

06:31.272 --> 06:33.672
What's so great
about New York anyway?

06:33.674 --> 06:35.173
No parents for one.

06:35.175 --> 06:37.142
Speak for yourself.

06:40.681 --> 06:41.746
Oh, shit!

06:41.748 --> 06:44.248
- What is in there?
- It's resin.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.916
I scraped it
out of my mom's pipe.

06:45.918 --> 06:48.986
Well, at least she
left you something.

06:50.722 --> 06:53.552
I think my dad's down
in New York too, actually.

06:53.779 --> 06:55.046
What?

06:55.393 --> 06:57.927
I thought you said
your dad died.

06:57.929 --> 07:00.363
Yeah, that's what
my mom says, but...

07:00.365 --> 07:03.432
Well, Johnny seems
to think she's full of shit.

07:05.703 --> 07:08.670
Well, you know, this is beat.

07:12.007 --> 07:13.541
Oh, shit.

07:14.209 --> 07:16.510
- Check it out.
- What?

07:23.252 --> 07:24.918
What are you doing?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.856
Oh, dude, gross.

07:30.858 --> 07:33.392
Oh, yeah, it's Sandy McCoy's.

07:33.394 --> 07:35.060
I'm telling you.

07:48.340 --> 07:49.239
Oh, great.

07:49.241 --> 07:50.507
Oh, it's hitting me hard.

07:50.509 --> 07:52.776
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Wait.

07:52.778 --> 07:54.111
Is it panty or panties?

07:54.113 --> 07:55.812
Oh, okay, so panties
is plural...

07:55.814 --> 07:58.581
Shut up and take it.

08:14.063 --> 08:15.297
Hey, Mom.

08:15.299 --> 08:16.731
Hey, Mrs. H.

08:17.466 --> 08:18.832
Hey, guys.

08:19.067 --> 08:21.001
Mom, can I get a loan?

08:21.003 --> 08:23.137
I already gave you
your birthday present.

08:23.139 --> 08:24.505
Yeah, but I spent it.

08:24.507 --> 08:25.472
Your father called again,

08:25.474 --> 08:27.507
that girl Eliza will be
here at 6:05 now.

08:27.509 --> 08:29.142
She's taking a different bus.

08:29.144 --> 08:30.643
Who's Eliza?

08:30.645 --> 08:31.711
Eliza Caplan.

08:31.713 --> 08:32.645
The ballerina's daughter.

08:32.647 --> 08:34.780
- Who's a ballerina?
- My dad's girlfriend.

08:34.783 --> 08:38.482
Apparently Eliza was up at a
ski trip with some prep school girls.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.720
She's making a pit stop here before
heading home after midnight.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.755
That's even more of a reason
I'll need some money.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.891
Well, let's hope your dad
sent her with some.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.225
You know, I don't even
know why he sent her.

08:48.227 --> 08:49.393
I don't know her.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.595
Well, maybe he's finally
reaching out to you

08:51.597 --> 08:54.298
without getting his own
hands dirty, of course.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.033
You know my dad is an
absolute fucking asshole!

08:57.035 --> 09:01.237
I mean, what, I've seen him a few
times in the last seven years?

09:01.239 --> 09:03.907
And out of nowhere he
sends this fucking girl.

09:03.909 --> 09:06.976
Yeah, I mean like, your
average Manhattan girl is

09:06.978 --> 09:10.512
way hotter than the cream of
the crop here in Lintonburg, so...

09:10.514 --> 09:12.014
Dude.

09:16.251 --> 09:19.153
- You think that's...
- I don't know.

09:21.890 --> 09:24.826
Excuse me are you, uh,
are you Eliza?

09:26.060 --> 09:28.395
Which one of you is Jude?

09:29.464 --> 09:31.498
That would be, uh, me.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.967
You don't look like
a Prudence.

09:34.868 --> 09:37.003
Oh, uh, no, Prudence, uh...

09:37.005 --> 09:38.170
She's at home, I'm Teddy.

09:38.172 --> 09:39.405
What's on your face, Teddy?

09:39.407 --> 09:42.908
Is that some sort of Dracula
skate punk thing, uh...

09:42.910 --> 09:43.843
Oh, right, um...

09:43.845 --> 09:47.879
It's, we get it from...
We huffed turpentine.

09:47.881 --> 09:48.747
Shit.

09:48.749 --> 09:52.384
That is like, that's sad.

09:55.086 --> 09:58.833
- Happy New Year!
- Wow!

09:59.094 --> 10:01.325
Welcome to
exciting Lintonburg.

10:01.327 --> 10:04.327
Yeah, this should be
interesting, right?

10:04.329 --> 10:08.431
You know we should probably just
crash Tory Ventura's party.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.899
I mean, he's a total douche,

10:09.901 --> 10:11.434
but he is a
major drug connection.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.968
Everyone goes.

10:12.970 --> 10:14.736
Yeah, unfortunately
it'll be filled with

10:14.738 --> 10:16.571
like, jocks and metal
heads, I don't know

10:16.573 --> 10:18.173
if your boyfriend's
one of those, but...

10:18.175 --> 10:19.775
No, uh... No, I
don't have a boyfriend

10:19.777 --> 10:23.377
and if I did he wouldn't be
a jock or a metal head.

10:25.113 --> 10:27.748
So you guys strike me
as Misfits fans.

10:27.750 --> 10:28.649
- Yeah.
- Yes.

10:28.651 --> 10:30.151
- Yeah.
- No, we love Misfits.

10:30.153 --> 10:32.552
I mean, we're into
all kinds of hardcore,

10:32.554 --> 10:33.920
but, uh...

10:33.922 --> 10:34.788
Are you? Nice.

10:34.790 --> 10:36.756
Uh, my brother
actually has a band

10:36.758 --> 10:38.558
in the East Village,
it's uh, Army of One.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.399
They're like hardcore but they're
also like, Straight Edge.

10:41.593 --> 10:42.898
What's Straight Edge?

10:42.933 --> 10:45.597
It's a whole other scene,
no drugs, no sex, no meat,

10:45.599 --> 10:48.485
- like drinking or weed...
- Boring. - Basically. - Yeah.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.936
- That's pretty boring. - But, uh,
their music's pretty awesome.

10:50.938 --> 10:53.871
I saw the Misfits once at
Irving Plaza when I was 11.

10:53.873 --> 10:57.341
It was my first show with the
Necros and the Beastie Boys.

10:57.343 --> 10:59.677
You went to a show
when you were 11?

10:59.679 --> 11:02.045
Yeah, I mean
I didn't go alone.

11:02.047 --> 11:03.480
Who did you go with?

11:03.482 --> 11:04.481
Your dad.

11:04.483 --> 11:05.615
He put me on his shoulders.

11:05.617 --> 11:08.399
I could see everything.
It was such a good show.

11:11.537 --> 11:12.414
Christ!

11:12.523 --> 11:14.779
Look, how long are you gonna keep
writing, huh? It's New Year's Eve.

11:14.782 --> 11:17.059
No, I've got to
finish Eliza's essay

11:17.061 --> 11:17.927
for the Taft Academy.

11:17.929 --> 11:20.631
- Yeah, well shouldn't she do
that herself, hmm? - She did.

11:20.997 --> 11:23.398
And she answered the question
about her future goals

11:23.400 --> 11:27.836
with a 250-word essay on her
ambitions to be a makeup artist.

11:27.838 --> 11:29.970
- Mmm.
- Written in eyeliner.

11:29.972 --> 11:32.439
- I applaud her creativity.
- Yeah.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.241
- You would.
- Mmm.

11:34.375 --> 11:38.345
You got any New Year
resolutions, Princess Di?

11:38.347 --> 11:40.780
- Yes.
- What are they?

11:41.014 --> 11:42.748
To stop dating my dealer.

11:42.750 --> 11:43.583
Why would you do that?

11:43.585 --> 11:44.784
With me you get the
whole package.

11:44.786 --> 11:48.321
- Sex and drugs, huh.
- Oh, yeah I forgot.

11:48.323 --> 11:51.957
<i>...clocks, and then 1988!</i>

12:02.367 --> 12:05.169
I wonder how Eliza's
doing in Vermont.

12:05.171 --> 12:06.904
She's doing great. Mmm.

12:06.906 --> 12:10.206
Well, if your children
are anything like their father

12:10.208 --> 12:11.508
I should be very worried.

12:11.510 --> 12:13.009
Mmm, my kids are good eggs.

12:13.011 --> 12:15.478
You'd have to actually be around
them to know that, wouldn't you?

12:15.480 --> 12:20.315
Well, I've been around your daughter
for years and let me tell you something.

12:20.317 --> 12:22.484
She is no delicate flower.

12:23.454 --> 12:28.089
Dude, did I piss you off before when
I said that thing about your dad?

12:28.190 --> 12:29.857
Why would I be pissed at you?

12:29.859 --> 12:32.493
It's not your fault
my dad's a prick.

12:33.495 --> 12:34.862
Les is not a prick,
all right?

12:34.864 --> 12:38.198
I actually think he feels
extremely bad about everything.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.799
What's everything?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.169
Deserting you, uh...

12:42.171 --> 12:43.336
Not being there for you guys.

12:43.338 --> 12:45.172
You should have seen
him at Christmas.

12:45.174 --> 12:48.557
He got drunk, all right, and he was
outside on the balcony crying like a baby.

12:48.576 --> 12:51.577
It was right after he
talked to you on the phone.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.747
You were standing there
when I talked to my dad?

12:54.749 --> 12:56.414
He was in my apartment.

12:56.416 --> 12:57.515
I mean, don't you
think it's sad though?

12:57.517 --> 13:02.453
No, what's sad is how he sent
you to be his little messenger.

13:02.755 --> 13:04.022
Oh, my God.

13:04.024 --> 13:05.356
Les would never do that.

13:05.358 --> 13:07.424
In fact, he called me
a drama queen

13:07.426 --> 13:10.027
and a sad story addict
for wanting to come.

13:10.029 --> 13:13.397
No, you know my dad
is a sad fucking story.

13:13.399 --> 13:15.098
Not me, all right?

13:21.138 --> 13:22.371
Whoo!

13:23.574 --> 13:24.973
Did I say something?

13:24.975 --> 13:26.675
No. I'll be right back, okay?

13:26.677 --> 13:28.610
Can you hold this?

13:33.616 --> 13:35.516
Jude!

13:37.185 --> 13:38.886
Oh, shit.

13:42.290 --> 13:44.457
Whose car is this, man?

13:45.960 --> 13:47.961
Who cares?

13:50.331 --> 13:54.566
Jude, are you just gonna sit there
and be pissed off at the world?

13:54.901 --> 13:56.435
Eliza was just
trying to be nice.

13:56.437 --> 13:58.704
She was also being
pretty fucking nosey.

13:58.706 --> 14:01.506
Yeah, but she's also
pretty fucking pretty.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.674
Right? You've got to admit.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.343
She's pretty enough.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.177
Enough?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.945
Wow, you're picky.

14:08.313 --> 14:10.663
You think she's hot,
don't you?

14:10.917 --> 14:12.083
You got a boner for her, huh?

14:12.085 --> 14:14.050
- Will you stop, asshole?
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

14:14.052 --> 14:16.586
- Dude! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- What?

14:16.588 --> 14:17.587
Dude!

14:17.589 --> 14:19.055
I lost my contact, man.

14:19.057 --> 14:22.025
- Aw, shit.
- I spent all my money on that.

14:24.327 --> 14:25.394
Uh...

14:25.396 --> 14:27.763
Oh, wait. Wait, is this it?

14:28.265 --> 14:30.099
Jesus, you found it.

14:30.867 --> 14:34.702
I'm gonna find the bathroom.
Are you gonna come back to the party?

14:47.415 --> 14:48.148
Teddy!

14:48.150 --> 14:50.550
There you are.
I've missed you, baby.

14:50.552 --> 14:51.984
- Hey, Annabelle.
- Annabelle?

14:51.986 --> 14:54.287
Yeah,
keep going just go.

14:54.289 --> 14:56.322
Where are you going?

15:01.962 --> 15:06.531
Oh, my God, that guy was
totally about to maul me.

15:06.533 --> 15:08.166
Did you see that?

15:11.603 --> 15:13.804
Why are you looking
at me like that?

15:14.706 --> 15:16.273
Is that coke?

15:16.775 --> 15:19.009
You can't be that country.

15:19.011 --> 15:21.010
Have you never
done it before?

15:21.512 --> 15:23.112
I, uh, snorted some

15:23.114 --> 15:26.316
ground up chalk as a
joke once.

15:26.483 --> 15:29.885
Well, your luck's
about to change.

15:35.391 --> 15:36.958
Oh, yeah.

15:38.995 --> 15:40.394
Oh, shit!

15:40.396 --> 15:42.396
Whoa, whoa.

15:43.298 --> 15:44.231
Oh, shit!

15:44.233 --> 15:45.132
- Fucker!
- Oh, I'm sorry!

15:45.134 --> 15:46.767
What the fuck are you
doing in my car, huh?

15:46.769 --> 15:47.768
I didn't!
No, I wasn't!

15:47.770 --> 15:48.835
You touching my
herb in my car?

15:48.837 --> 15:50.170
- You fucking leaf thief!
- I wasn't!

15:50.172 --> 15:53.606
- Have you lost your
fucking mind, Judy?

15:55.419 --> 15:57.010
Uh...

15:57.012 --> 15:59.645
Jude so hates
my guts, doesn't he?

15:59.947 --> 16:05.150
And I came here to be friends
and as usual I've screwed it up.

16:06.286 --> 16:07.519
No.

16:07.787 --> 16:09.387
Jude's actually really sweet.

16:09.389 --> 16:12.056
He just doesn't like
to show it.

16:12.758 --> 16:15.827
Something tells me
you're the sweet one.

16:21.966 --> 16:22.799
What's this?

16:22.801 --> 16:25.102
Oh, it's um, it's a
token for the subway.

16:25.104 --> 16:27.037
Get out!

16:27.905 --> 16:30.072
Yeah, uh, my brother
gave it to me.

16:30.074 --> 16:31.640
It's supposed to be good luck.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.776
I'm sure.

16:35.312 --> 16:37.979
Hey, can I ask
like a weird favor?

16:37.981 --> 16:39.214
Depends.

16:39.382 --> 16:43.017
If I gave you his address,
could you go see him

16:43.019 --> 16:45.720
and get him to call me?
He doesn't have a phone.

16:47.222 --> 16:49.022
Are you Indian?

16:49.024 --> 16:50.424
What?

16:50.426 --> 16:52.059
Uh, yeah...

16:52.061 --> 16:52.893
Half.

16:52.895 --> 16:55.962
Uh, Gandhi not Geronimo.

16:56.063 --> 16:59.298
You have the most
amazing eyelashes.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.502
Like the women in the
Bollywood movies.

17:02.504 --> 17:03.936
Thank you.

17:12.044 --> 17:13.377
There.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.913
I like that better.

17:14.915 --> 17:15.945
Oh, it doesn't matter to me.

17:15.948 --> 17:19.784
I can't see anything anyway.
My contact fell out.

17:20.819 --> 17:22.353
And where is it?

17:22.686 --> 17:24.121
In my hand.

17:30.361 --> 17:32.429
Wait, what are you doing?

17:32.730 --> 17:34.563
I'm getting it moist.

17:35.398 --> 17:36.765
Come here.

17:40.170 --> 17:41.737
Which eye is it?

17:52.080 --> 17:53.447
Is it in?

17:54.248 --> 17:55.615
Think so.

17:56.017 --> 17:57.717
I think so too.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.241
Oh! Oh, my God.

18:30.882 --> 18:32.515
Oh, fuck.

18:34.652 --> 18:38.754
Three, two, one,
Happy New Year!

18:41.113 --> 18:43.124
Jude!

18:43.426 --> 18:46.361
- Jude!
- I'm fucking over here!

18:47.029 --> 18:48.263
Jesus!

18:50.800 --> 18:51.899
You okay, man?

18:51.901 --> 18:54.268
- Untie me.
- Jesus.

18:54.270 --> 18:55.169
What happened?

18:55.171 --> 18:57.271
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck happened?

18:57.273 --> 18:58.305
Oh, my God!

18:58.307 --> 18:59.840
Let me get this out.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.820
Where were you guys
all that time?

19:14.822 --> 19:17.055
Uh, just, you know, talking.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.157
Did she say anything about me?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.359
No. No.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.195
Just that maybe
that you hated her.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.564
I don't hate her.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.399
This whole night
is just fucked up.

19:30.401 --> 19:32.168
Pretty pissed, huh?

19:51.153 --> 19:52.787
Sure you okay?

19:53.322 --> 19:54.722
Yes.

19:54.724 --> 19:58.258
We can begin with the panties
again if you want, man.

19:58.826 --> 20:01.962
No, I have a better idea.
Come here.

20:06.501 --> 20:08.834
What are you doing?

20:09.736 --> 20:11.170
Freon, dude.

20:11.172 --> 20:12.905
It's free.

20:14.508 --> 20:16.909
You sure you know
what you're doing, man?

20:16.911 --> 20:18.710
Yes, I've done it before.

20:18.712 --> 20:20.745
I kind of just wanna go home.

20:20.747 --> 20:22.280
- Jude...
- Jesus!

20:22.282 --> 20:24.015
Stop being a pussy.

20:26.052 --> 20:27.685
You owe me.

20:31.389 --> 20:32.656
Okay.

20:34.926 --> 20:36.160
Okay.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.963
I think we're good.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.948
Dude, dude!

21:02.851 --> 21:04.218
Take it!

21:05.320 --> 21:06.319
Oh!

21:06.321 --> 21:08.688
Oh, my God!

21:14.161 --> 21:15.094
Oh!

21:25.772 --> 21:27.271
Happy New Year's.

21:27.273 --> 21:28.906
You're a dick.

21:29.642 --> 21:32.243
- It felt good.
- Oh, shit!

21:56.932 --> 21:57.866
Hey.

21:57.868 --> 22:01.069
What the hell are you
two doing out here?

22:05.140 --> 22:06.507
Jude!

22:08.810 --> 22:10.044
Jude!

22:11.713 --> 22:13.346
You okay?

22:14.348 --> 22:15.882
Are you okay?

22:16.350 --> 22:18.117
What is it?

22:21.922 --> 22:23.755
Oh, my God!

22:23.856 --> 22:25.390
Oh, Teddy.

22:26.159 --> 22:28.060
Teddy, wake up, honey!

22:28.394 --> 22:30.495
Teddy, Teddy, honey, wake up!

22:30.497 --> 22:31.729
Teddy!

22:32.931 --> 22:33.664
Stay here, I'm gonna...

22:33.666 --> 22:36.067
Don't move. Jude,
don't move, okay?

22:36.069 --> 22:37.034
Don't move.

22:37.036 --> 22:40.404
I'm gonna call an
ambulance.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.658
Jude.

23:31.283 --> 23:34.519
<i>And a happy
New Year's Day, New York.</i>

23:34.521 --> 23:38.757
<i>Here's to your hangover
with this classic from Traffic.</i>

24:04.514 --> 24:06.014
Jesus Christ.

24:11.853 --> 24:13.487
Lester's pad.

24:15.957 --> 24:17.290
Hey, Harriet.

24:17.292 --> 24:18.224
How'd it go?

24:18.226 --> 24:20.059
You and Eliza have fun?

24:20.194 --> 24:22.562
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what?

24:22.963 --> 24:25.031
What? Who?

24:31.271 --> 24:32.437
Oh, my God!

24:36.475 --> 24:39.644
What you want, baby?
I got what you need.

24:54.892 --> 24:56.792
Who are you
looking for?

25:00.597 --> 25:02.898
I'm looking for Johnny.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.967
His brother Teddy sent me.

25:06.435 --> 25:07.869
You just found him.

25:07.871 --> 25:09.804
You want a cigarette?

25:09.872 --> 25:12.373
No, I'm Straight Edge
and Krishna.

25:13.209 --> 25:14.442
Wow.

25:14.577 --> 25:16.977
That's, uh, quite
a double bill.

25:16.979 --> 25:17.811
Well, not really.

25:17.813 --> 25:20.347
They complement
each other perfectly.

25:20.349 --> 25:24.084
Clean living, transformation,
and transcendence.

25:24.418 --> 25:27.744
It's funny you, uh, having a brother
that's like completely opposite you.

25:28.890 --> 25:32.325
We have different fathers but
we're more alike than we look.

25:32.327 --> 25:36.361
Yeah, I don't really even know
him that well. We just met actually.

25:36.363 --> 25:38.530
So, you got no phone
in your place?

25:38.532 --> 25:42.200
I've got no nothing in my
place. I'm squatting.

25:42.735 --> 25:43.801
Rise and shine, Louie.

25:43.803 --> 25:45.469
Need to use the phone.

25:45.471 --> 25:46.971
All right, Johnny.

25:47.906 --> 25:50.774
- Jesus, you all right?
- Yeah, thanks, man.

26:03.820 --> 26:04.820
Mom?

26:04.822 --> 26:06.722
What are you home now?

26:06.789 --> 26:08.891
Where the hell have you been?

26:10.360 --> 26:11.593
What?

26:16.298 --> 26:18.599
<i>What the
fuck are you saying?</i>

26:25.406 --> 26:27.507
<i>This is all your fault.</i>

26:27.975 --> 26:29.109
This is all your fault.

26:29.111 --> 26:30.610
You fucking cunt!

26:34.814 --> 26:38.884
For the Lord does not
abandon anyone forever.

26:38.886 --> 26:43.254
The book of Jude tells us
that when Christ reappears,

26:43.256 --> 26:44.489
he will not be alone.

26:44.491 --> 26:49.027
But instead surrounded
by 10,000 saints.

26:49.161 --> 26:52.262
Let us take comfort
in knowing that today

26:52.264 --> 26:56.400
<i>this number becomes
10,001.</i>

27:02.439 --> 27:04.340
Who's "TM"?

27:04.741 --> 27:06.609
Just a boy who died.

27:19.522 --> 27:20.788
Jude!

27:21.556 --> 27:24.358
Is he ever
gonna go back to school?

27:53.986 --> 27:55.219
Hey.

27:56.121 --> 27:57.355
It's me!

28:01.592 --> 28:02.993
Whoo!

28:05.262 --> 28:06.596
I hope I didn't alarm you.

28:06.598 --> 28:09.665
I just thought maybe
it'd be good if we had a few,

28:09.667 --> 28:13.068
few seconds before the
girls knew I'm here, huh.

28:13.670 --> 28:15.404
Nice.

28:15.406 --> 28:17.472
What the fuck are
you doing here?

28:17.474 --> 28:19.140
Come to kidnap you.

28:19.808 --> 28:22.377
What did you...
What's with your hair?

28:22.379 --> 28:23.544
Huh?

28:27.648 --> 28:31.585
I'm sorry about your
buddy, Teddy, you know.

28:31.652 --> 28:32.419
You hardly knew him.

28:32.421 --> 28:35.055
Yeah, but I'm still
sorry, you know.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.275
- You got weed in here?
- Maybe.

28:42.607 --> 28:44.263
Maybe. Come on,
don't bullshit me.

28:44.265 --> 28:46.097
Where is it?
Let me see it.

28:53.139 --> 28:54.372
Mmm.

28:59.477 --> 29:01.412
Ugh!

29:01.414 --> 29:04.536
- Where did you get
this ditch weed? - I stole it.

29:04.717 --> 29:06.783
Yeah, well stealing's
not cool, Jude.

29:06.785 --> 29:08.484
It's not cool at all.
All right?

29:08.486 --> 29:12.755
From now on, you're only
smoking your dad's shit.

29:14.425 --> 29:15.657
Phew!

29:17.927 --> 29:22.097
What did you mean when you
said you were here to kidnap me?

29:22.099 --> 29:23.799
I'm rescuing you.

29:23.801 --> 29:25.166
Taking you to the Big Apple.

29:25.168 --> 29:26.534
And why would I go with you?

29:26.536 --> 29:29.203
I'm offering you
Manhattan, champ.

29:29.205 --> 29:31.205
Don't play hard to get.

29:33.508 --> 29:35.408
Would I have to go to school?

29:35.410 --> 29:36.543
Afraid so.

29:36.545 --> 29:38.645
Well, fuck that.
I'm never going back.

29:38.647 --> 29:40.780
Except for, I mean,
driver's ed, but...

29:40.782 --> 29:42.382
Okay, New York public
schools blow anyway.

29:42.384 --> 29:43.149
You're safer on the street.

29:43.151 --> 29:44.650
But you're gonna have to
have gainful employment

29:44.652 --> 29:46.852
and promise not
to tell your mom.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.755
When will we leave?

29:51.024 --> 29:52.624
Tomorrow morning.

29:53.025 --> 29:56.027
Don't you just feel the
bad vibes in this place?

29:56.029 --> 29:57.095
Seriously.

29:57.097 --> 29:58.663
Pack up your shit, huh?

29:58.665 --> 30:00.631
I'm gonna go say
hi to your mom.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.033
Good talking to you.

30:02.035 --> 30:04.497
You know what?
Fuck you! Uh...

30:06.438 --> 30:09.840
- Hey, hold on a second.
- Prudence, my baby girl, hi!

30:10.575 --> 30:12.608
Um...

30:12.610 --> 30:14.499
- What are you doing here?
- Look at you.

30:14.534 --> 30:18.247
Growing up into
a stone-cold fox.

30:18.415 --> 30:21.250
Uh, I'll be off in a
couple of secs, okay?

30:21.252 --> 30:23.251
Yeah, I'm back. Sorry.

30:23.652 --> 30:26.254
No, that, yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

30:28.591 --> 30:29.524
Mmm-hmm.

30:40.169 --> 30:42.468
Mmm...

30:43.137 --> 30:44.370
Hello, Les.

30:44.372 --> 30:46.572
- Remember me?
- Yeah, hello.

30:46.574 --> 30:47.940
How long have you been here?

30:47.942 --> 30:49.142
Damn you look good, huh.

30:49.144 --> 30:52.544
Long enough to have a
successful father-son reunion.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.746
- Really? It went well?
- Yeah, yeah. No, it went great.

30:54.748 --> 30:56.148
We're gonna leave in
the morning.

30:56.150 --> 30:59.651
I figure you might make us
something delicious, you know?

30:59.653 --> 31:01.252
And then, maybe I
crash with you?

31:01.254 --> 31:02.486
- Oh, really?
- For the night, yeah.

31:02.488 --> 31:04.388
- Is that the plan?
- That's the plan, yeah.

31:04.390 --> 31:06.524
Thinking you wouldn't have
worn that patchouli,

31:06.526 --> 31:10.860
- if you didn't want a little bit of Lester.
- Come on!

31:10.862 --> 31:12.295
Stop, please!

31:25.441 --> 31:26.675
Les.

31:27.043 --> 31:30.077
- Come on, wake up.
Flashback's over. - Mmm...

31:30.335 --> 31:33.487
- I thought we were gonna
have a lost weekend. - Oh, no.

31:33.650 --> 31:35.583
I've had enough of
those to last a lifetime.

31:35.585 --> 31:36.317
- One more time.
- No.

31:36.319 --> 31:37.852
You have a long road
ahead of you.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.653
- Come on, come on.
- Get up.

31:39.655 --> 31:40.687
It'll only take
another second.

31:40.689 --> 31:42.522
Your son is packed
and ready to go.

31:42.524 --> 31:45.091
Harriet, come on,
come on, come on.

31:45.093 --> 31:45.992
Baby.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.245
This place is a shoebox.

32:44.247 --> 32:46.546
Yeah, well it's a rent
controlled shoebox.

32:46.548 --> 32:51.184
I got it off this lady friend of mine
who went back to her husband.

32:51.186 --> 32:55.154
The one you got pregnant
and left your family for?

32:55.156 --> 32:57.055
Uh, no.

32:57.057 --> 32:57.990
A different one.

32:57.992 --> 33:00.959
She never had that
kid, by the way.

33:01.027 --> 33:02.594
What about Eliza's mom?

33:02.729 --> 33:05.323
- Did you break up that
marriage too? - Uh, no.

33:05.665 --> 33:09.534
Eliza's dad dropped dead of a
heart attack when she was about...

33:09.772 --> 33:11.030
Three.

33:11.065 --> 33:14.504
He was some kind of fancy
pants lawyer I think.

33:14.506 --> 33:16.139
Eliza's dad,

33:16.141 --> 33:17.140
Teddy,

33:17.142 --> 33:19.109
the almost-Donahue kid.

33:19.111 --> 33:22.545
It's almost as easy to not
be here as it is to be here.

33:22.547 --> 33:23.446
Yeah, pretty much.

33:23.448 --> 33:25.481
Okay, I cleaned this
off for you.

33:25.483 --> 33:27.583
Okay, this is your domain.

33:27.585 --> 33:28.584
No pets.

33:28.586 --> 33:30.686
Otherwise anything goes.

33:31.388 --> 33:35.223
How about a little
pack-a-lolo before unpacking?

33:35.225 --> 33:36.591
Hmm?

33:37.059 --> 33:38.559
- That's fine with me.
- Yeah?

33:38.561 --> 33:41.663
This is one of your
mother's finest.

33:41.665 --> 33:42.664
I call her Gertrude.

33:42.666 --> 33:45.666
"Hamlet, cast thy
knighted color off. "

33:46.969 --> 33:48.368
I guess you can see why

33:48.370 --> 33:50.937
Eliza's mom won't spend
time here, huh?

33:50.939 --> 33:52.539
Would you hold this for a sec?

33:52.541 --> 33:54.874
It's all part
of my master plan.

33:54.876 --> 33:59.512
These are tips that you need
to learn on your way to manhood.

33:59.514 --> 34:04.382
Truthfully you'll probably be pulling a
lot of ass now that you're a New Yorker.

34:04.650 --> 34:06.918
Did I already tell you
that I have a handgun?

34:06.920 --> 34:07.919
You're serious?

34:07.921 --> 34:08.786
Yeah, yeah.
.38 Special,

34:08.789 --> 34:10.455
it's right underneath
the kitchen sink there.

34:10.456 --> 34:12.889
His name's McQueen,
but don't ever touch it,

34:12.891 --> 34:14.257
unless I tell you to.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.192
Why would you tell me to?

34:15.194 --> 34:18.106
I guess we should probably
talk about curfew, right?

34:18.268 --> 34:20.166
- What curfew?
- Exactly.

34:20.299 --> 34:22.398
As long as you demonstrate
that you are somewhat

34:22.400 --> 34:24.667
in control of your
faculties, all right?

34:24.668 --> 34:28.103
As long as you return at night
from wherever it is you go,

34:28.106 --> 34:31.639
I am willing to forgo
any curfew.

34:31.641 --> 34:33.742
Is Mom cool with all this?

34:33.744 --> 34:35.277
If you stay out of trouble,

34:35.279 --> 34:36.210
your mother doesn't need
to know everything.

34:36.213 --> 34:40.382
She seems to be of the opinion
that this is some kind of rehab clinic.

34:40.384 --> 34:43.317
Which it clearly is not.

34:52.025 --> 34:53.525
Understood?

34:55.596 --> 34:57.030
Understood.

34:57.032 --> 34:58.365
Glad to hear it.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.981
Eliza!

35:18.217 --> 35:20.183
I've got good news.

35:20.418 --> 35:21.251
Les' son is in town,

35:21.253 --> 35:22.285
and we're all having
dinner tonight,

35:22.287 --> 35:25.922
which is, you know, I...
I think's a really good thing.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.924
I'm in the shower.

35:31.862 --> 35:35.364
You see, Diane used to be
a world-class ballerina.

35:35.366 --> 35:37.133
And the thing about
ballerinas is,

35:37.135 --> 35:39.234
when they're dancing,
they do a ton of blow.

35:39.236 --> 35:42.737
And when they're retired,
they smoke a ton of grass.

35:42.739 --> 35:43.972
So that's how you met her?

35:43.974 --> 35:47.642
Yeah, well, no, actually I was
dating her friend first...

35:47.644 --> 35:49.042
Hello.

35:49.044 --> 35:50.811
Thank you.

35:52.714 --> 35:55.716
Hi. We have a table for...

35:57.185 --> 35:58.818
Oh, hey, hey!

35:59.386 --> 36:00.520
Ladies...

36:00.522 --> 36:02.789
Hi. Come and join us
for a drink.

36:02.791 --> 36:05.024
- Look at you.
- Hi.

36:05.026 --> 36:06.826
How are you?

36:07.161 --> 36:08.460
Jude!

36:08.462 --> 36:10.695
Well, we're all
just so thrilled

36:10.697 --> 36:14.332
you're here with us in
New York, aren't we Eliza?

36:15.368 --> 36:17.916
Eliza, come on, you've been whining
about meeting my kids forever

36:17.951 --> 36:21.472
and now one of them finally
materializes and you check out.

36:21.474 --> 36:23.374
I'm not checking out, okay?

36:24.309 --> 36:26.543
How do you like it
so far in New York?

36:26.545 --> 36:28.278
Oh, it's so much better
than Vermont.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.480
And the music's great too.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.816
And what kind of music
do you listen to?

36:32.818 --> 36:34.451
Hardcore mostly.

36:34.453 --> 36:36.151
Hardcore...

36:36.153 --> 36:38.821
Is that one you know, Eliza?

36:38.823 --> 36:39.788
Eliza knows it.

36:39.790 --> 36:42.376
And she even saw The Misfits
in concert. Right, Dad?

36:42.597 --> 36:45.294
And what does
it sound like?

36:45.528 --> 36:48.329
Um, have you ever
heard of punk?

36:48.797 --> 36:50.164
Darling, I'm from England.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.399
What do you mean,
The Clash, the Sex Pistols?

36:51.401 --> 36:55.569
It's kind of, but a huge scene in New
York right now is Straight Edge,

36:55.571 --> 36:58.538
which basically means
no drinking, no drugs,

36:58.540 --> 37:02.142
and, uh, just not
being promiscuous.

37:02.144 --> 37:04.444
In the old days we
called that "square. "

37:04.446 --> 37:06.245
- I'm not square, Dad.
- Yeah, well...

37:06.247 --> 37:08.647
- Some of them are recovering addicts.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:08.649 --> 37:11.584
Some of them have
parents who are addicts.

37:14.554 --> 37:16.387
Well, do you know what,
I think that sounds

37:16.389 --> 37:19.824
like a fabulous organization,
don't you, Eliza?

37:19.826 --> 37:22.093
Fabulous, darling.

37:22.095 --> 37:23.628
Eliza.

37:23.928 --> 37:26.597
Teddy's brother is in a really
popular Straight Edge band.

37:26.599 --> 37:28.031
- Is he? - I'm trying to
find out where he lives.

37:28.033 --> 37:31.301
Well, that shouldn't be too difficult,
doesn't his mother know where he lives?

37:31.303 --> 37:33.536
Oh, his mother's nice but...
She's crazy.

37:33.538 --> 37:36.639
Off her rocker, yeah,
that too, right?

37:37.474 --> 37:38.674
Do you have, um,
some more sake?

37:38.676 --> 37:42.245
Yes, I'm dying for some more sake.
Let's get some immediately.

37:42.247 --> 37:45.814
Excuse me, hi, could we have
another large sake, please?

37:45.816 --> 37:47.148
You have Johnny's address?

37:47.150 --> 37:49.718
That's right by us. I mean,
it's a fourth tier hell,

37:49.720 --> 37:51.586
but I'll take you over
there if you want.

37:51.588 --> 37:53.420
This is Teddy's
handwriting.

37:53.422 --> 37:54.588
How'd you get this?

37:54.590 --> 37:56.290
Yes, how did you get
that, darling?

37:56.292 --> 37:59.927
Excuse me, I need
to use the restroom.

38:27.686 --> 38:30.454
Feels weird that she
got to Johnny's before me.

38:30.456 --> 38:32.022
Yeah, but now I
get to show you.

38:32.024 --> 38:33.657
I'm the best tour guide
in the world, man.

38:33.659 --> 38:37.394
I'll tell you everything there is to
know about this lovely little hamlet

38:37.396 --> 38:39.930
known as Alphabet City.

38:40.097 --> 38:43.832
Okay, the A in Avenue A
stands for, "Asking. "

38:43.834 --> 38:45.768
As in, "You're asking
for it. "

38:45.770 --> 38:49.805
The B stands for
"Buddy, watch your back. "

38:49.807 --> 38:52.640
The C stands for "Crazy. "

38:52.642 --> 38:55.910
As in, "Are you fucking
crazy?"

38:55.912 --> 38:58.780
And D is for "Dude,
you are dead. "

38:58.782 --> 39:00.782
- What, you serious?
- I'm absolutely serious,

39:00.817 --> 39:03.984
but the road to hell is paved
with some fun along the way.

39:03.986 --> 39:06.520
Like check this out, right,
you see this right here?

39:06.522 --> 39:07.955
- Does that ring a bell?
- Not really.

39:07.957 --> 39:10.389
<i>Album cover to Led Zeppelin's
Physical Graffiti.</i>

39:10.391 --> 39:11.624
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:11.626 --> 39:14.093
You got Lenny Bruce's
apartment somewhere down here

39:14.095 --> 39:15.761
and Abbie Hoffman was
somewhere up here.

39:15.763 --> 39:18.965
Back a block, you got the most
famous bathhouse in the world.

39:18.967 --> 39:20.799
- Bathhouse?
- Yeah, it's like a place where

39:20.801 --> 39:24.743
- dudes like to soap each other up and
get crazy, you know. - That's gross.

39:24.778 --> 39:27.772
Yeah, that's what the city thought too,
that's why they shut it down, man.

39:27.774 --> 39:30.407
AIDS is changing everything
around here.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.478
Look how lucky
we are, you know?

39:34.480 --> 39:38.314
World-renowned Tompkins
Square Park is right outside our door.

39:38.316 --> 39:40.316
Doesn't look,
uh, very park-like.

39:40.318 --> 39:42.118
You sound like
all the yuppies

39:42.120 --> 39:45.622
who want to get the homeless
out of here and make it look pretty.

39:45.624 --> 39:46.556
Like that's going to happen.

39:46.558 --> 39:49.992
Well, don't be so sure, champ,
money's got a big mouth.

39:49.994 --> 39:53.295
All right, this is you,
this is your block.

39:53.297 --> 39:54.463
Should be right down there.

39:54.465 --> 39:58.699
Yeah, but this is about as far as I'll go,
it's too dangerous.

39:59.468 --> 40:00.501
Well, thanks, Dad.

40:00.503 --> 40:01.702
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

40:01.704 --> 40:03.738
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

40:07.475 --> 40:10.210
Jude, run! Run!

40:13.914 --> 40:15.448
Keep running, white boy.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.883
Fuck you!

40:33.333 --> 40:39.136
Hey, Johnny, it's, uh...
It's Jude, Teddy's friend.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.205
I just moved here with my dad.

40:42.207 --> 40:45.875
Thought you know, uh...

40:46.309 --> 40:49.078
You made it out
of Vermont, buddy.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.613
Come here, man.

40:51.448 --> 40:55.316
It's like a little piece of
Teddy just walked in my door.

40:59.522 --> 41:00.989
Guys, guys.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.090
Meet Jude K-Horn.

41:02.092 --> 41:07.828
He's a kid from my old hood who just
relocated to live with his drug-dealer dad.

41:07.830 --> 41:09.697
He was my brother's
best friend.

41:09.699 --> 41:11.532
It says everything about him.

41:12.534 --> 41:13.567
Hey.

41:13.569 --> 41:15.268
- Hey, what's up.
- Hey, man.

41:15.270 --> 41:16.636
Here, sit down.

41:16.937 --> 41:18.871
- Cool dragon tattoo, man.
- Thanks.

41:18.873 --> 41:21.441
Yeah, Johnny's masterpiece.

41:21.443 --> 41:25.143
He's an artist with a
needle or a sharpie.

41:26.746 --> 41:29.548
So, uh, Jude, tell me...

41:29.550 --> 41:35.252
Word is that daddy's weed is
pretty out-of-this-world, huh?

41:35.254 --> 41:38.019
- Yeah, no, it's incredible.
- Oh, excellent.

41:38.511 --> 41:40.467
How long do you plan
to exist in the greatest

41:40.654 --> 41:43.430
city in the world like
a fucked up zombie?

41:43.672 --> 41:45.428
Indefinitely?

41:46.976 --> 41:51.920
Gentlemen... Army of One has just
inherited their first official charity case.

41:53.204 --> 41:54.636
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

41:56.372 --> 41:57.609
Oh, whoa, wait.

41:57.644 --> 41:58.607
- What are you doing?
- Well, you still play, don't you?

41:58.609 --> 42:02.010
- I mean, a little, but... - Yeah, okay,
let's see what you got, Vermont.

42:02.012 --> 42:06.013
We'll start at the basics.
Minor Threat.

42:58.830 --> 43:02.030
Darling, do you like
this shade of red?

43:03.167 --> 43:07.302
Just bought it at Saks and
I'm not sure it's my color.

43:07.304 --> 43:09.470
- Looks fine.
- Really?

43:11.840 --> 43:13.574
We've got to go shopping
when I get back.

43:13.576 --> 43:17.144
They've got some really cute
new things for spring, you know.

43:17.146 --> 43:18.546
Right.

43:20.781 --> 43:22.582
Okay, darling, well the
car's downstairs.

43:22.584 --> 43:26.953
I'm only going to be at this silly
dance conference for three nights.

43:29.189 --> 43:32.891
All my contact info is on
the fridge, Nina's here.

43:32.893 --> 43:34.459
- Curfew's at 9:00, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

43:34.461 --> 43:36.495
And Les is around if you
need him for anything.

43:36.497 --> 43:38.629
I love you.
I'm going to miss you.

43:38.631 --> 43:41.399
- You won't be lonely,
will you? - No.

43:42.401 --> 43:46.737
All right, sweetie, call
me anytime, okay?

43:46.805 --> 43:48.271
Have fun.

44:18.733 --> 44:20.267
Your bag, miss.

44:20.368 --> 44:22.369
- I'm sorry?
- Your handbag, miss.

44:22.371 --> 44:25.706
- I'm just... I'm just
going in here. - It's policy.

44:33.580 --> 44:36.882
Fine, I'll just... I'll just
go leave it in the car then.

45:03.741 --> 45:05.274
Hey.

45:08.344 --> 45:09.945
Hey.

45:11.347 --> 45:13.882
It feels weird that we
haven't hung out, you know?

45:13.884 --> 45:17.218
Yeah, I know. I've
been kind of preoccupied.

45:17.220 --> 45:20.688
Well, I'm psyched you want
to check out Johnny's matinee.

45:24.191 --> 45:25.792
You seem so different.

45:25.794 --> 45:27.327
What do you mean?

45:27.329 --> 45:28.662
More serious.

45:28.664 --> 45:31.564
Well, look, I think I know
how to change that.

45:31.566 --> 45:33.199
Check this out.

45:33.533 --> 45:34.833
What is that?

45:34.835 --> 45:36.368
It's shrooms.

45:36.370 --> 45:37.403
I thought it'd be fun.

45:37.405 --> 45:39.939
And Johnny mentioned something
about going to a Krishna temple,

45:39.941 --> 45:43.274
which could be, like,
seriously trippy, you know?

45:43.276 --> 45:45.877
I thought you were going
whole-hog Straight Edge

45:45.879 --> 45:48.279
with the new haircut
and all, no?

45:48.281 --> 45:50.548
I just say that to bug my dad.

45:50.550 --> 45:53.283
I'm mainly into it
for the music.

45:53.285 --> 45:54.651
Well, I don't want any.

45:54.653 --> 45:56.486
Come on, a little won't hurt.

45:56.488 --> 45:58.355
I said no, Jude!

45:59.691 --> 46:02.558
How come you would with
Teddy, but not with me?

46:02.826 --> 46:04.961
What is that supposed
to mean?

46:04.963 --> 46:07.565
You know,
they found coke in his system.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.365
So I figured, he had to
have gotten it from you.

46:09.367 --> 46:10.666
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

46:10.668 --> 46:13.268
Why would you say something
so shitty to me?

46:13.270 --> 46:15.203
Do you have any idea
what I'm going through?

46:15.205 --> 46:17.539
Calm down! I just...
I just thought...

46:17.541 --> 46:18.373
You thought what?

46:18.375 --> 46:22.276
I just... I just
thought we could party

46:22.278 --> 46:23.544
a little.

46:23.546 --> 46:25.612
Like when Teddy was here.

46:25.747 --> 46:30.217
And maybe it would feel like
he was still with us, you know?

46:33.921 --> 46:35.588
I'm sorry, Jude.

46:45.698 --> 46:46.898
Yeah!

47:47.320 --> 47:49.521
<i>What's going on?</i>

47:52.992 --> 47:57.694
<i>We're right here with you,
we're on the train going to Brooklyn.</i>

47:57.696 --> 47:59.496
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

47:59.498 --> 48:01.331
<i>Am I dead?</i>

48:01.333 --> 48:03.000
<i>We're right here
with you.</i>

48:03.002 --> 48:05.402
<i>Please, God, tell me
he's going to be okay.</i>

48:05.404 --> 48:07.336
<i>This can't happen
to me again,</i>

48:07.338 --> 48:09.272
<i>tell me he's going to be okay.</i>

48:09.406 --> 48:11.808
Am I dead?

48:11.909 --> 48:14.277
- Am I dead?
- No, you're fine.

48:14.279 --> 48:15.511
You're all right.

48:16.680 --> 48:17.946
- Oh!
- What is going on?

48:17.948 --> 48:20.315
Listen, you guys are
both just shrooming out, okay?

48:20.317 --> 48:23.151
You got trampled on and
she got paranoid.

48:23.153 --> 48:24.686
Is this your idea of fun?

48:24.688 --> 48:25.953
She didn't take any.

48:25.955 --> 48:27.354
Eliza, are you okay?

48:27.356 --> 48:28.222
What the fuck?

48:28.224 --> 48:30.958
Everything is
my fault, Jude.

48:30.960 --> 48:34.361
I'm the one who gave Teddy
coke, don't you get it?

48:34.363 --> 48:36.029
That's why I'm being punished.

48:36.031 --> 48:37.597
No, no, I made him huff

48:37.599 --> 48:39.833
fucking Freon, okay?

48:39.835 --> 48:42.969
I'm the one who needs
to be punished.

48:42.971 --> 48:45.004
My God!

48:46.239 --> 48:48.240
This isn't about
punishment, okay?

48:48.242 --> 48:50.008
I just want to stop it all.

48:50.010 --> 48:54.213
No more drugs,
no more fucking up.

48:54.547 --> 48:56.747
Abstinence and restraint

48:56.749 --> 48:58.182
make one fit for immortality.

48:58.184 --> 49:02.854
That's what these people here believe,
that's what needs to come out of all this.

49:02.856 --> 49:04.955
True commitment, all right?

49:04.957 --> 49:06.490
Commitment from you, Jude.

49:06.492 --> 49:08.258
- I'm ready to commit.
- Yeah.

49:08.260 --> 49:09.493
I'm ready to stop.

49:09.495 --> 49:12.295
- Eliza?
- I have to stop.

49:12.430 --> 49:14.163
Don't you two get it?

49:14.165 --> 49:16.398
I'm fucking pregnant.

49:25.332 --> 49:27.755
<i>- Les.
- Yeah.</i>

49:27.790 --> 49:30.912
<i>What's going on? I haven't
heard from Jude in over a week.</i>

49:30.914 --> 49:34.615
<i>Harriet, Harriet, that's
too much stress, too early.</i>

49:34.617 --> 49:36.783
It's not healthy
for you, babe.

49:36.785 --> 49:38.252
Not healthy at all.

49:38.254 --> 49:39.586
Put Jude on.

49:39.588 --> 49:41.421
Hold on, hold on.

49:43.657 --> 49:46.192
Oh, looks like he's
up and at 'em.

49:46.194 --> 49:49.495
It's 7:00. You told me he
leaves for school at 7:40.

49:49.497 --> 49:50.897
Yeah, well...

49:50.899 --> 49:54.032
Just hold on one second,
okay? I got another call.

49:54.034 --> 49:55.600
<i>Les.</i>

49:55.602 --> 49:57.068
- Yello?
- Yeah, I, um...

49:57.070 --> 49:58.069
I just spoke to
the housekeeper

49:58.071 --> 50:01.006
and she told me that Eliza
was out all night with Jude.

50:01.008 --> 50:04.375
<i>You do know that she's on
strict orders to be home by 9:00?</i>

50:04.377 --> 50:07.311
Oh, yeah, well,
they went to, uh...

50:07.313 --> 50:10.381
Uh, Johnny's show I guess,
and it got late.

50:10.383 --> 50:11.614
Who the hell is Johnny?

50:11.616 --> 50:12.582
<i>Jude's new best bud.</i>

50:12.584 --> 50:14.918
You know, he's Mr. Clean,

50:14.920 --> 50:17.420
brainwashing my kid
to stay off drugs.

50:17.422 --> 50:18.588
<i>Just put her on, will you?</i>

50:18.590 --> 50:21.690
She is there, isn't she? That's
what she told the housekeeper.

50:21.692 --> 50:24.805
Well, yeah, look,
she's just, uh...

50:24.880 --> 50:26.183
She's in the shower

50:26.449 --> 50:27.829
and so why don't I just have
her call you back in 10, okay?

50:27.831 --> 50:29.898
Listen, I got somebody else
on the other line, all right?

50:29.900 --> 50:32.833
Just hold on, hold on
one second, yeah.

50:32.835 --> 50:34.902
That's good.

50:37.706 --> 50:39.607
Should we tell your mom?

50:39.609 --> 50:42.809
She'll just make
me get an abortion.

50:42.811 --> 50:45.045
What makes you say that?

50:45.346 --> 50:48.552
Because she said to me,
"Eliza, darling, if you ever get pregnant,

50:48.587 --> 50:51.483
"you're getting an abortion. "

50:51.685 --> 50:54.687
You know, it's like Teddy
died that night

50:55.989 --> 50:58.357
to be born again
inside you.

50:59.025 --> 51:01.459
Yeah, that's kind of
how I feel.

51:03.729 --> 51:05.964
Like it happened for a reason.

51:07.967 --> 51:10.601
But sometimes I don't
know how I feel.

51:11.469 --> 51:16.306
"For the soul, there's neither birth
nor death at any given time. "

51:16.574 --> 51:19.141
What is that,
the Old Testament?

51:19.143 --> 51:20.876
The Bhagavad Gita.

51:23.480 --> 51:25.248
Maybe we should tell my dad.

51:25.250 --> 51:27.083
He'll just tell my mom, Jude.

51:27.085 --> 51:29.017
We shouldn't tell anybody.

51:29.552 --> 51:31.653
That way we can control it.

51:31.921 --> 51:34.122
Well, I obviously can't
keep it a secret forever.

51:34.124 --> 51:39.093
Yeah, but after a certain point,
they can't take it away from you.

51:39.894 --> 51:42.162
And where is the baby
going to live?

51:42.164 --> 51:44.565
I mean, are you planning
on staying in school?

51:44.567 --> 51:48.001
You cross one
bridge at a time.

51:51.739 --> 51:54.307
At the very least,
you should see a doctor.

51:54.608 --> 51:57.075
I'm sure he'll ask to
see an adult.

51:57.077 --> 51:58.744
Well, Johnny is an adult.

51:58.746 --> 52:00.379
From here on out,

52:00.381 --> 52:03.582
I'm going to be anybody
Eliza needs me to be.

52:04.884 --> 52:08.019
We're in this together now,
we're a little family.

52:08.021 --> 52:09.020
Right, Jude?

52:10.490 --> 52:11.922
Jude!

52:13.692 --> 52:15.559
- Jude!
- Shit!

52:16.662 --> 52:18.395
Okay, okay, okay.

52:21.832 --> 52:26.268
Jude, we need to discuss
this whole curfew again.

52:30.273 --> 52:34.410
I thought we had kind
of a working arrangement.

52:36.578 --> 52:38.012
You know?

52:43.252 --> 52:44.485
Huh?

52:44.820 --> 52:49.756
So you're just going to play father now
and lay a whole new set of rules on me?

52:49.758 --> 52:51.525
No, no.

52:51.527 --> 52:55.561
I am going to revisit all this

52:55.563 --> 53:01.534
after I have digested
my vegan breakfast, eh?

53:02.836 --> 53:06.237
You know what I'd
like to know is

53:06.605 --> 53:09.908
what my girlfriend's
daughter and my son,

53:09.910 --> 53:14.611
and some weird Hare Krishna
dude are all doing together.

53:15.413 --> 53:17.514
We're just friends, okay?

53:17.516 --> 53:19.083
No, I'm not judging.

53:19.085 --> 53:21.585
I mean, I met your mom
at an orgy.

53:26.156 --> 53:29.959
So tell me, what did you think
of the show, last night?

53:30.561 --> 53:34.329
That was last night? Feels
like 100 years ago.

53:34.331 --> 53:36.331
I thought you guys
were really good.

53:36.333 --> 53:38.667
It's a very weird
scene though.

53:38.669 --> 53:40.402
In what way?

53:40.404 --> 53:41.370
Well, I mean...

53:41.372 --> 53:46.340
First of all, I might as well have been
invisible to most of the guys there.

53:46.342 --> 53:49.643
Do I look that disgustingly
pregnant already?

53:49.645 --> 53:50.911
No. Don't take that
personally,

53:50.913 --> 53:53.012
Straight Edge guys
are different.

53:53.014 --> 53:55.181
They're not just about
meeting girls.

53:55.850 --> 53:57.884
Well, what about you?

53:58.519 --> 54:00.220
What about me?

54:00.222 --> 54:01.654
Well, are you gonna...

54:01.656 --> 54:04.456
Are you gonna wait till
you're married, or what?

54:04.458 --> 54:06.291
I mean, that's what the whole
thing's about, right?

54:06.293 --> 54:09.595
Not that there is anything
wrong with it, I'm obviously

54:09.597 --> 54:11.696
a walking advertisement
for abstinence.

54:11.698 --> 54:14.532
What the whole thing is
all about is community.

54:14.534 --> 54:18.403
A hardcore family that's
free from all the bullshit

54:18.405 --> 54:19.871
that was spoon-fed to
us by a generation

54:19.873 --> 54:23.273
that would rather fry their
brains than purify them.

54:24.609 --> 54:25.409
But I was,

54:25.411 --> 54:28.278
I was asking specifically
about you.

54:28.280 --> 54:32.248
Oh, well, you know, I'm committed
to the Straight Edge life

54:32.250 --> 54:36.352
but I'm also just as
red-blooded as the next guy.

54:36.354 --> 54:39.622
Well, that's a very
vague answer.

54:40.589 --> 54:45.427
It's none of my business.
I don't even know why I'm asking.

54:45.429 --> 54:47.362
Hey, listen...

54:47.463 --> 54:50.531
I happen to think
you look really great.

54:51.299 --> 54:52.533
Thank you.

54:52.535 --> 54:54.334
And I meant what
I said before,

54:54.336 --> 54:57.838
about being anybody that
you need me to be.

55:00.607 --> 55:01.340
I know you did.

55:01.342 --> 55:04.977
Hey, I thought I'd never
get away from him.

55:04.979 --> 55:06.612
You didn't tell him
anything, did you?

55:06.614 --> 55:10.215
Of course not. I promised
Eliza I wouldn't.

55:10.349 --> 55:14.486
So when Eliza's mom finally
finds out about our secret,

55:14.488 --> 55:18.272
- I think we should tell her
I'm the father. - Why you?

55:18.758 --> 55:21.792
Well, I'm Teddy's
brother, so it's blood.

55:21.794 --> 55:23.994
And I'm also not a minor,
which you know,

55:23.996 --> 55:26.931
could help us out in a lot
of legal situations.

55:26.933 --> 55:27.798
And, and then what?

55:27.800 --> 55:31.134
And then we tell her, Eliza
and I are a committed couple.

55:31.302 --> 55:33.069
Why would we do that?

55:33.537 --> 55:35.038
'Cause maybe we should be.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.574
Except for the fact that you
barely know each other.

55:37.576 --> 55:40.943
We're already getting to know
each other, right, Eliza?

55:40.945 --> 55:43.045
We did have a nice brunch.

55:43.047 --> 55:44.046
Yeah.

55:44.048 --> 55:47.115
Anyway, look, nothing
should get in the way

55:47.117 --> 55:50.852
of what is in the best
interest for Teddy's child.

55:51.320 --> 55:52.954
You know.

55:53.422 --> 55:55.289
This is about love.

55:56.525 --> 56:01.828
Plus, there's nothing
not to like about me.

56:04.131 --> 56:05.866
I got to go.

56:06.267 --> 56:08.634
- I'll call you.
- All right.

56:09.870 --> 56:11.504
Spare change?

56:12.105 --> 56:14.907
She's something, isn't
she, Uncle Jude?

57:56.565 --> 57:57.865
Gross!

57:57.867 --> 58:00.101
<i>Mademoiselle Eliza?</i>

58:04.372 --> 58:07.001
Okay, we're here. I agreed,
we're on the train.

58:07.058 --> 58:09.053
You want to tell me
what's going on?

58:11.084 --> 58:13.846
Eliza's bleeding.

58:14.448 --> 58:16.983
Bleeding? What kind
of bleeding?

58:16.985 --> 58:20.086
You know, like a,
like a woman bleeding.

58:20.088 --> 58:23.121
Okay. So what makes you think
I'm more qualified to deal

58:23.123 --> 58:25.724
with that situation
than her mom?

58:31.429 --> 58:33.130
She's pregnant.

58:37.702 --> 58:39.969
Are you shitting me?

58:40.838 --> 58:41.804
Jude, what are you
thinking about?

58:41.806 --> 58:44.941
You know I got a buttload
of condoms in my pad.

58:44.943 --> 58:46.109
It's not mine, Dad.

58:46.111 --> 58:49.178
And even if it was, you're
in no position to preach.

58:49.180 --> 58:51.747
Okay, okay, well who...

58:52.215 --> 58:54.483
Who's done the deed then?

58:54.760 --> 58:56.881
- Johnny.
- Johnny?

58:56.916 --> 58:59.987
Why is Johnny not on the
train going to meet her?

58:59.989 --> 59:01.822
He doesn't have a phone.

59:03.425 --> 59:04.592
Perfect.

59:04.594 --> 59:07.595
You can't tell Diane yet, Dad.

59:08.530 --> 59:10.664
You have to promise.

59:14.636 --> 59:16.436
<i>In downtown
Manhattan's Alphabet City,</i>

59:16.438 --> 59:21.073
<i>tensions continued to rise today, when a
stand-off occurred between squatters,</i>

59:21.075 --> 59:25.310
<i>their supporters and the police
over a building deemed unsafe.</i>

59:25.312 --> 59:26.612
If she loses the baby, okay...

59:26.614 --> 59:30.314
I mean, you hate to say this,
but it's probably for the best.

59:30.416 --> 59:33.251
You know, she's not
ready to be a mom.

59:33.552 --> 59:36.320
It's nature's way of
taking care of things.

59:36.855 --> 59:38.755
How does it happen?

59:38.856 --> 59:41.925
I mean, is it just
like blood or...

59:41.927 --> 59:43.260
I do not know.

59:43.262 --> 59:44.828
I'll tell you this though.

59:44.830 --> 59:48.431
It's a relief to me that
you're not the dad, okay?

59:48.799 --> 59:50.099
You don't want to get
tied up in that.

59:50.101 --> 59:52.702
You know, the lady's
grieving, she's distraught,

59:52.704 --> 59:56.138
she feels guilty,
you feel guilty.

59:56.140 --> 59:58.206
Babies.

01:00:05.881 --> 01:00:09.149
You know you were born here?

01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:11.652
It's true.

01:00:11.986 --> 01:00:15.922
The night we adopted you,
your mom and I we were

01:00:16.423 --> 01:00:17.390
up in the nursery

01:00:17.392 --> 01:00:20.827
in these rocking chairs, they gave
us scrubs with these little

01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:23.262
shower caps for our heads
and for our feet,

01:00:23.264 --> 01:00:26.164
like they thought we were
going to give you the plague.

01:00:27.633 --> 01:00:31.737
We just waited and waited
and waited

01:00:31.739 --> 01:00:33.038
for you.

01:00:33.439 --> 01:00:35.806
Seemed like we'd wait forever.

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:38.676
Rocking back and forth,
you know,

01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:40.311
your mom was so uptight.

01:00:40.313 --> 01:00:44.315
She was so worried your
birth mother changed her mind.

01:00:44.382 --> 01:00:47.617
She had this king size
bag of M&M's right,

01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:50.754
and she just
ate the whole thing

01:00:50.756 --> 01:00:53.389
while she was waiting
for you.

01:00:54.524 --> 01:00:58.127
And then they, uh...
They let us hold you.

01:01:00.463 --> 01:01:03.532
And you were so little,
like a rabbit or something,

01:01:03.534 --> 01:01:07.935
you know, with this
shock of black hair.

01:01:07.937 --> 01:01:11.539
And you looked at me
and I was like, "Holy shit!

01:01:12.141 --> 01:01:13.840
"This kid is mine,

01:01:13.842 --> 01:01:17.744
"and the world's a fucking
mess and I just wanna...

01:01:19.313 --> 01:01:21.615
"I want to protect him
from everything, you know. "

01:01:21.617 --> 01:01:24.850
I mean, I have to protect
him from everything.

01:01:25.787 --> 01:01:30.156
Oh, I walked out of here
a different person.

01:01:30.824 --> 01:01:33.625
Yeah, well...
So I thought.

01:01:33.859 --> 01:01:35.960
And then Prudence
miraculously shows up.

01:01:35.962 --> 01:01:38.396
Right, first they tell you,
it's impossible.

01:01:38.398 --> 01:01:42.133
Next thing, you're swimming
in babies, two in one year.

01:01:43.234 --> 01:01:44.168
You know women,

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:49.673
they make their decisions and men,
we just do our best not to be men.

01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:54.610
The whole system needs
a looking over.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:56.445
Les.

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:57.980
Oh, Jesus...

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:01.050
Hey, sweetheart.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.659
"Bacterial vaginosis. "

01:02:11.193 --> 01:02:12.593
Sounds exotic.

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:14.128
It's just an infection, Les.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.398
Yeah, still, it sounds
scary, you know?

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.301
He saw her on the monitor,
you know?

01:02:21.335 --> 01:02:24.604
She was jumping around
like a jumping bean.

01:02:25.239 --> 01:02:26.072
She?

01:02:26.074 --> 01:02:28.408
- So they told you?
- No.

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.976
No, I mean, I didn't
want to know.

01:02:31.578 --> 01:02:34.847
For some reason I keep
calling it Annabelle.

01:02:35.949 --> 01:02:38.884
Oh, well, your mom's
gonna be psyched.

01:02:39.052 --> 01:02:41.419
You know, we're getting
you home before 9:00.

01:02:53.365 --> 01:02:55.565
- No screaming, okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:55.567 --> 01:02:57.534
All right. Okay.

01:02:57.536 --> 01:03:00.936
I can't believe you, of
all people, ratted us out.

01:03:00.938 --> 01:03:01.837
I didn't tell her!

01:03:01.839 --> 01:03:05.441
She got the one bill the hospital
didn't send to my apartment.

01:03:05.443 --> 01:03:07.343
That's how far I've gone
to cover for your asses.

01:03:07.345 --> 01:03:08.544
Anything for
a pound, right, Les?

01:03:08.546 --> 01:03:10.545
Leave the actual parenting
to somebody who has the time.

01:03:10.547 --> 01:03:12.447
Okay, you can blame me for
screwing up my own kids,

01:03:12.449 --> 01:03:14.115
- but this one you can't pin
on me, okay? - Thank you.

01:03:14.117 --> 01:03:15.683
Well, I suppose I could've
kept better tabs on her,

01:03:15.685 --> 01:03:18.352
if I just let her drop out and
smoke reefer all day, hey?

01:03:18.354 --> 01:03:19.620
I don't smoke reefer anymore.

01:03:19.622 --> 01:03:21.788
Okay, listen, you two are
peas in a pod, all right?

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:23.123
You know why she doesn't
tell you anything, Diane?

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:26.627
Because you try to control every
situation you get your hands on.

01:03:26.629 --> 01:03:31.631
And you know why she does that, 'cause
you are totally out of control, all right?

01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:35.301
What, you been kicked out of
19 schools already.

01:03:35.303 --> 01:03:36.502
Two, Les, two.

01:03:36.504 --> 01:03:37.469
You love to exaggerate,
don't you?

01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:41.573
Yeah, well no wonder she wants you
to go to this Florence Critteren facility.

01:03:41.575 --> 01:03:42.407
Shit!

01:03:42.409 --> 01:03:44.409
- Florence who?
- Oh, God.

01:03:44.411 --> 01:03:45.944
Why would I need to go
to a facility?

01:03:45.946 --> 01:03:47.278
It's the only place
that'll have you.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.046
It's a place where
they take your baby.

01:03:49.048 --> 01:03:50.848
No, no, they don't take it.

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:53.083
- They don't sell it into slavery.
- They don't.

01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:58.621
They give it to loving parents who
can take care of it properly.

01:03:58.623 --> 01:04:01.090
You mean people
like my dad?

01:04:04.863 --> 01:04:06.895
Oh, God! Okay.

01:04:07.063 --> 01:04:08.730
Okay, that's this, this,
what's his name?

01:04:08.732 --> 01:04:11.400
- Johnny.
- Johnny, thank you.

01:04:11.402 --> 01:04:16.303
- Okay, so what I don't want right now,
is a big scene, okay? - Okay.

01:04:16.339 --> 01:04:21.142
This is an adult situation which
we're all going to get through

01:04:21.343 --> 01:04:23.811
like civilized people, right?

01:04:23.813 --> 01:04:27.614
I've even had Nina make us
all a nice leg of lamb.

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:29.049
We're vegan.

01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:37.489
So I hear you three have been
spending quite a bit of time together.

01:04:37.491 --> 01:04:38.624
Oops, sorry.

01:04:38.626 --> 01:04:41.660
It's like they speak
in code, isn't it, Les.

01:04:41.662 --> 01:04:44.796
They say, um, "Straight Edge,"

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:45.697
- vaygan...
- Vegan.

01:04:45.699 --> 01:04:48.566
- Vegan's are from the the
planet Vega. - Vegan, sorry.

01:04:48.568 --> 01:04:50.034
Vegan, yeah.

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:54.105
We just go to the
temple mostly.

01:04:54.639 --> 01:04:57.874
Yeah, I heard.
The, the temple.

01:04:58.042 --> 01:05:00.944
Not like the temple where
Eliza was bat mitzvah'ed, no.

01:05:00.946 --> 01:05:05.481
- Hmm. - It's the Hare Krishna
temple in Brooklyn.

01:05:05.882 --> 01:05:07.717
No, of course it is.

01:05:09.953 --> 01:05:12.922
So what do you do for
a living Johnny?

01:05:12.924 --> 01:05:14.255
I'm a musician.

01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:16.224
I'm also a tattoo artist,

01:05:16.226 --> 01:05:18.660
but I don't... I don't tell
too many people that,

01:05:18.662 --> 01:05:20.795
'cause it's illegal in
the city right now.

01:05:20.797 --> 01:05:22.263
- You don't have
to worry about

01:05:22.265 --> 01:05:25.499
telling her anything, she's practically
married to a drug dealer.

01:05:25.501 --> 01:05:29.470
- Uh-uh, a botanist. - No, we're
not even remotely married.

01:05:29.472 --> 01:05:31.238
Specialty in cannabis.

01:05:31.674 --> 01:05:36.142
So do you manage to make a
decent living applying your tattoos?

01:05:36.144 --> 01:05:37.677
Um, I'm getting there.

01:05:37.679 --> 01:05:39.178
I work out of my
squat right now,

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.614
so there's not a whole
lot of overhead.

01:05:41.616 --> 01:05:45.884
- That's smart.
- In fact, there's none.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.689
What about your family,
where do they live?

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:55.526
You know, I don't really
have much family, ma'am.

01:05:55.894 --> 01:05:58.729
- But I will soon.
- Christ!

01:05:59.464 --> 01:06:00.731
Sorry.

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:02.265
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Mom.

01:06:02.267 --> 01:06:05.268
I'm sorry that my
entire existence

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:06.202
- has disappointed you.
- Okay...

01:06:06.204 --> 01:06:09.973
You know I bet that first kid you
aborted would have been a real winner.

01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:12.207
- Eliza! - You obviously
picked the wrong fetus.

01:06:12.209 --> 01:06:14.143
- For God's sake, Eliza!
- Oh, my God!

01:06:14.145 --> 01:06:16.779
Here's the fact, ma'am.

01:06:17.914 --> 01:06:20.282
I want this baby just as
much as Eliza does

01:06:20.284 --> 01:06:24.986
and nothing in this world
is going to change that.

01:06:24.988 --> 01:06:30.657
So given that, I feel like
now is as good a time as any.

01:06:31.325 --> 01:06:33.994
What, no, stop.
Wait, okay, okay...

01:06:33.996 --> 01:06:36.830
Sorry, hello? Dinner
is officially over. Les!

01:06:36.832 --> 01:06:39.066
Yeah, okay, yeah.
Hey, hey, Johnny, Johnny...

01:06:39.068 --> 01:06:40.566
It's a school night,
so I think you should leave.

01:06:40.568 --> 01:06:41.767
- Les, could you help him go?
- Yeah, come on, man.

01:06:41.769 --> 01:06:43.436
- I thought this is what we wanted.
- Bad timing, bud.

01:06:43.438 --> 01:06:47.540
- Bad timing. - Good night, sweetheart.
It was really nice to meet you.

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:49.674
I'm sure I'll see
you again soon.

01:06:49.676 --> 01:06:52.177
Um, thanks for coming, okay?

01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:54.312
You're not going anywhere.

01:07:03.855 --> 01:07:05.622
Les!

01:07:05.624 --> 01:07:09.225
Shh, shh! Hey, come on now.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.597
Hey, it's 3:30 in the morning,
all right? Jude's asleep.

01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:16.566
Good. I need to talk
to you alone.

01:07:16.568 --> 01:07:18.400
Oh, my God!

01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:19.534
How did you escape?

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:24.039
Waited for her Valium to kick in
and slipped out the service stairwell.

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.974
Oh, great, great.

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:29.510
So, what, you're gonna,
you're gonna move in with us?

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:32.146
- Only temporarily.
- Yeah?

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:37.151
Johnny and I are getting married
and I'm going on tour with the band.

01:07:38.018 --> 01:07:39.252
Okay, well, just so you know,

01:07:39.254 --> 01:07:44.190
that's about the worst fucking plan
I've ever heard in my whole life, okay?

01:07:44.192 --> 01:07:46.826
I do know. Have you got
a better one?

01:07:46.828 --> 01:07:48.193
I do. You have the baby here

01:07:48.195 --> 01:07:49.394
and then, you know, we sell
it on the black market.

01:07:49.396 --> 01:07:53.799
I got a dude in Brooklyn who says he'll
give us an easy 10 grand for a white one.

01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:54.933
And what if it's not white?

01:07:54.935 --> 01:07:59.904
Well, that sounds like a conversation
you should have with good old Johnny.

01:08:01.907 --> 01:08:04.709
Come on, you really
want to marry this

01:08:04.711 --> 01:08:07.277
necklace-wearing Hare Rama?

01:08:07.279 --> 01:08:09.446
You love this guy?

01:08:10.448 --> 01:08:13.116
- I love how much he cares.
- Right, and...

01:08:13.118 --> 01:08:18.187
And we can't get a real marriage license
till I turn 18 without parental consent

01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:20.689
and that's obviously not
going to happen.

01:08:20.691 --> 01:08:24.126
It's more of a spiritual
union thing at the temple.

01:08:24.127 --> 01:08:26.127
Okay. All right, well.

01:08:26.261 --> 01:08:30.665
Why don't you just try playing
it all a little bit by ear, you know?

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:32.901
Is that what you do, Les?

01:08:32.903 --> 01:08:34.301
You just play it all
by ear?

01:08:34.304 --> 01:08:37.638
Yeah, I find it's the best
organ to play by.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.509
Yeah, I mean, I have been accused
of playing by another, but, uh...

01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:44.962
Come on.
No, hey.

01:08:45.013 --> 01:08:48.514
Come on, you're just so young,
sweetheart. You are.

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:51.951
I just need some place
safe to go, Les.

01:08:52.853 --> 01:08:56.054
Some place
I can actually think,

01:08:56.055 --> 01:08:58.055
away from her.

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:01.326
You know, if I help you out,

01:09:01.328 --> 01:09:07.264
it'll pretty much destroy what's left
of my relationship with your mother, right?

01:09:09.935 --> 01:09:11.335
Well...

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:13.603
Oh.

01:09:13.604 --> 01:09:17.040
Did you meet my old lady when
you were out there in Vermont?

01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:19.509
No. We were too busy
with sex and drugs.

01:09:19.511 --> 01:09:23.645
Well, she's a piece of work,
you know, but...

01:09:24.481 --> 01:09:28.317
...she's better at this kind
of shit than I am.

01:09:29.852 --> 01:09:33.554
You know, I believe in
this and I have to do it

01:09:33.555 --> 01:09:34.287
for Teddy.

01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:36.557
Neither of us had
a father in our life.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.761
It would mean a lot to me if
you'd say, you'd understand.

01:09:40.763 --> 01:09:42.796
I can't say that
because I don't.

01:09:42.798 --> 01:09:44.631
There's a strong tradition
in lots of cultures

01:09:44.633 --> 01:09:47.901
that when a man dies,
his brother steps in to marry his wife.

01:09:47.903 --> 01:09:51.870
<i>It's even in Krishna consciousness,
re-read the Laws of Manu.</i>

01:09:51.872 --> 01:09:54.707
They call it
"widow inheritance. "

01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:57.209
Now that's fucking romantic.

01:09:59.079 --> 01:10:03.548
So you're just going to carry your
brother's ashes around with you, forever?

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:07.151
Rooster, come on.

01:10:07.519 --> 01:10:10.221
Not even the dead
get to be free.

01:11:07.507 --> 01:11:08.873
Les!

01:11:10.542 --> 01:11:13.511
Open the door, you fuck.
I know you're in there.

01:11:14.446 --> 01:11:17.548
- Just trying to get
my daughter. - Oh, all right.

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:21.351
Les!

01:11:24.422 --> 01:11:25.689
Hey!

01:11:25.923 --> 01:11:28.223
Take good care of her,
Saint Jude.

01:11:28.225 --> 01:11:29.958
It's a bit late for that, Dad.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.026
The van's a piece of shit.

01:11:31.028 --> 01:11:33.529
I'm talking about
Eliza, champ.

01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:36.765
- You should talk to
Johnny about that.

01:11:36.767 --> 01:11:38.399
- He's her husband now.
- Mmm.

01:11:38.401 --> 01:11:39.300
At least in the
eyes of Krishna.

01:11:39.302 --> 01:11:42.403
You don't sound too
happy about that.

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.274
- What are you going to do?
- Hmm.

01:11:46.276 --> 01:11:48.775
Try to get Princess Di
off your trail,

01:11:48.777 --> 01:11:50.711
if she'll even talk to me.

01:11:53.748 --> 01:11:56.482
You know, I really
appreciate all this.

01:11:56.783 --> 01:11:59.719
What else am I gonna do?
After being such a useless shit for...

01:11:59.721 --> 01:12:01.487
Let's get this show
on the road!

01:12:01.489 --> 01:12:04.290
Yeah, all right, all right!

01:12:38.455 --> 01:12:40.689
- Take it easy, Jude.
- Sorry.

01:12:40.691 --> 01:12:43.458
God, he's only had his
license for, like, a week.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.494
Oh, I hope we make
it there alive.

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.296
Is, uh, is Rooster
not coming at all?

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.664
Oh...

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:52.933
Rooster is, uh...

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:56.336
He's gonna play with
another band for a bit.

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.571
Why's he doing that?

01:12:58.906 --> 01:13:01.307
Well, the lead singer, uh,

01:13:01.309 --> 01:13:03.009
had a really bad
heroin problem

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.777
and needed a good influence.

01:13:04.779 --> 01:13:07.713
So who's gonna play
guitar for Army of One?

01:13:09.349 --> 01:13:10.582
Well...

01:13:10.784 --> 01:13:13.818
There is an open slot, my man.

01:13:15.587 --> 01:13:17.355
<i>This time
you've really crossed</i>

01:13:17.357 --> 01:13:20.091
- the line. - Okay, tell me,
what was I supposed to do?

01:13:20.093 --> 01:13:23.727
Certainly not lend
them your van, Les!

01:13:24.762 --> 01:13:27.097
They were gonna run away
to God knows where.

01:13:27.099 --> 01:13:31.375
I convinced them to take her to
Harriet's where she will be safe.

01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:33.531
- Well, now you can take me
there then. - No, I can't... - Okay?

01:13:33.566 --> 01:13:36.038
No, she says if you show up there,
she's gonna go on tour with the band.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.041
Hopping from
motel to motel...

01:13:39.043 --> 01:13:43.445
Come on, that's no life
for a pregnant teenager.

01:13:46.115 --> 01:13:49.250
Why is she
doing this to me?

01:13:53.421 --> 01:13:55.456
Look, I, I have their
confidence, okay?

01:13:55.458 --> 01:13:58.859
There's a, there's a open line
of communication, right?

01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:02.962
Now, Harriet will tell
me everything.

01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:05.598
Eliza is in good hands.
Come on, babe.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.233
I know it doesn't
seem like it,

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:10.169
but I've been doing
all this for you.

01:14:15.741 --> 01:14:18.743
You really need
to leave now, Les.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.361
- Jude.
- Hey, Mom.

01:14:38.363 --> 01:14:40.195
Hi.

01:14:40.530 --> 01:14:42.364
Look at your hair.

01:14:42.432 --> 01:14:44.833
- Is it really you?
- It really is.

01:14:45.668 --> 01:14:48.036
- Something smells good.
- Mmm, come in.

01:14:48.038 --> 01:14:49.770
And you must be Eliza.

01:14:49.772 --> 01:14:51.138
- Hi.
- Hey, Prudence.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:53.241
Tell me, sweetie,
you're how far along?

01:14:53.243 --> 01:14:55.009
- I'm almost six months.
- Wonderful!

01:14:55.011 --> 01:14:57.245
Then you're way past all that
morning sickness nonsense.

01:14:57.247 --> 01:15:02.148
- Mom says you started smoking.
- I hope it's only cigarettes.

01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:03.483
Come in, it's nice to see you.

01:15:03.485 --> 01:15:04.518
Come in, I have a
vegetarian dinner...

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.354
- Oh, my God.
- ... or breakfast, or whatever, on.

01:15:07.356 --> 01:15:10.322
- Hey, hi. - Well, come on,
come in. Hello, Johnny.

01:15:12.492 --> 01:15:14.660
Harriet's so great.

01:15:15.295 --> 01:15:17.196
So easy to talk to.

01:15:18.297 --> 01:15:19.531
Yeah.

01:15:20.199 --> 01:15:24.235
She was... She was so
good to Teddy too.

01:15:24.706 --> 01:15:26.095
You know?

01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:29.206
She was like... She was like
the mom he never had.

01:15:57.599 --> 01:15:58.933
So I guess this is, uh...

01:15:58.935 --> 01:16:01.669
It's kind of like
our honeymoon, huh?

01:16:02.537 --> 01:16:03.771
Yeah.

01:16:04.639 --> 01:16:05.872
Well...

01:16:05.973 --> 01:16:09.208
It ain't exactly
Hawaii, but it'll do.

01:17:34.319 --> 01:17:36.353
Yeah, but it tastes
so much better without the...

01:17:36.355 --> 01:17:39.757
No, I asked for a salad and you would
come back with one-inch carrots!

01:17:39.759 --> 01:17:41.758
- I remember that,
I remember that.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.194
"Okay, need a few more. "
Very sweet.

01:17:45.196 --> 01:17:49.399
No, no. We were just gonna
have one carrot, that was dinner.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:50.900
How much of this do you want?

01:17:50.902 --> 01:17:53.735
Um, well, I see four
there, so probably four.

01:17:53.737 --> 01:17:54.670
I'm hungry.

01:17:54.672 --> 01:17:56.938
Excuse me one
second, guys.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.473
Sure, hon.

01:18:22.929 --> 01:18:24.163
Hello?

01:18:25.965 --> 01:18:27.199
Hello?

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.403
Eliza?

01:18:33.806 --> 01:18:35.073
<i>Eliza?</i>

01:18:42.747 --> 01:18:45.949
Yeah, but... But...
Why, why...

01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:48.752
Why would you move
to California?

01:18:53.857 --> 01:18:55.591
That isn't fair.

01:18:55.593 --> 01:18:58.860
It's not like we ever
had anything that was defined,

01:18:58.862 --> 01:19:00.228
you know?

01:19:02.098 --> 01:19:04.599
That's how you wanted
it, Rooster.

01:19:11.639 --> 01:19:15.209
Maybe we both use the scene
as a cover, huh?

01:19:19.813 --> 01:19:21.214
I know.

01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:26.119
Please don't do anything
until I see you.

01:19:26.453 --> 01:19:30.122
I just lost my brother,
I don't need to lose you too.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.429
And the first leg of our
world tour comes to an end.

01:19:38.431 --> 01:19:39.363
Whoo!

01:19:59.315 --> 01:20:02.351
What're you doing
up at this hour?

01:20:03.419 --> 01:20:06.020
I could ask you
the same question.

01:20:07.190 --> 01:20:10.258
Annabelle won't let
me sleep anymore.

01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:13.594
Plus...

01:20:14.129 --> 01:20:16.396
Johnny boy snores.

01:20:20.735 --> 01:20:22.769
What're you writing?

01:20:23.738 --> 01:20:26.138
- It's just some lyrics.
- Hmm.

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.339
For a song.

01:20:27.341 --> 01:20:29.108
Is it about a girl?

01:20:29.843 --> 01:20:31.277
No.

01:20:31.279 --> 01:20:32.745
No, it's not like that.

01:20:32.747 --> 01:20:34.013
Oh, come on.

01:20:34.015 --> 01:20:36.047
With that beautiful face,

01:20:36.049 --> 01:20:39.717
I'm sure you have to beat
the groupies away by now.

01:20:39.985 --> 01:20:43.221
You know that's not
what our scene's about.

01:20:43.223 --> 01:20:44.555
Jude...

01:20:44.557 --> 01:20:47.257
Are you really gonna
let those stupid,

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:51.395
Straight Edge rules keep you
from finding true love?

01:20:59.803 --> 01:21:02.638
You know, today is
Teddy's birthday.

01:21:08.311 --> 01:21:10.445
He would have been 18.

01:21:23.557 --> 01:21:25.859
Happy birthday, Teddy.

01:21:51.515 --> 01:21:52.215
I don't, I don't understand.

01:21:52.217 --> 01:21:54.684
You said that whenever you weren't
playing, you would be with me.

01:21:54.686 --> 01:21:58.021
I know. I got to make
sure my squat's okay.

01:21:58.023 --> 01:22:01.957
You know, the city, they're
evicting people left and right,

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:06.262
now that the yuppies want
to live there. It's crazy.

01:22:09.266 --> 01:22:10.932
Don't be mad, okay?

01:22:10.934 --> 01:22:13.868
I'm working on a new
plan for both of us.

01:22:41.928 --> 01:22:43.461
Jude, have you...

01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:45.797
Have you ever thought about...

01:22:47.099 --> 01:22:49.800
Searching for
your birth parents?

01:22:53.872 --> 01:22:54.872
Not really.

01:22:54.874 --> 01:22:58.008
I, uh, I was talking
to Eric in your band.

01:22:58.475 --> 01:23:01.110
He told me he met his
birth mother in Korea.

01:23:01.445 --> 01:23:03.746
He said it was
a great experience.

01:23:04.181 --> 01:23:05.248
Eric's adopted?

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:08.483
His last name's Steinberg,
what do you think?

01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:11.853
I don't know, I mean,
he never talks about it.

01:23:11.855 --> 01:23:13.155
That's because
he's okay with it.

01:23:13.157 --> 01:23:17.959
He's got such an interesting perspective
on how life works, that guy.

01:23:17.961 --> 01:23:21.829
Why're you talking to Eric
about stuff like this?

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.634
I think Johnny's got
someone else.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:34.174
Why aren't you
saying anything?

01:23:35.609 --> 01:23:37.776
I don't know what to say.

01:23:38.144 --> 01:23:39.511
Maybe you do.

01:23:40.647 --> 01:23:43.649
Maybe you do, Jude,
and you just won't.

01:23:58.162 --> 01:23:59.629
Eliza...

01:24:01.399 --> 01:24:02.799
Just say it.

01:24:03.501 --> 01:24:06.936
Johnny and I
are a sham.

01:24:07.304 --> 01:24:10.606
Oh, God.
This whole thing's a big joke.

01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:14.076
You're gonna have Teddy's baby
and it will be beautiful.

01:24:14.078 --> 01:24:18.313
I don't even remember
what Teddy looks like.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.680
Fuck!

01:24:20.969 --> 01:24:22.418
I try.

01:24:22.453 --> 01:24:25.319
I try really hard when I'm
falling asleep at night, but I just...

01:24:25.321 --> 01:24:28.022
I can't seem to put his face
together in my mind.

01:24:28.024 --> 01:24:29.990
You should have said.
I, I have pictures of him.

01:24:29.992 --> 01:24:33.127
It's not... It's not
about pictures, Jude.

01:24:33.129 --> 01:24:34.927
You and Johnny are
exactly the same.

01:24:34.929 --> 01:24:38.698
You both want some little
replacement for Teddy.

01:24:38.899 --> 01:24:40.867
That's why I call her
Annabelle.

01:24:40.869 --> 01:24:42.702
So that everyone
will just stop it

01:24:42.704 --> 01:24:45.804
and think about me
once in a while.

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:51.910
Listen...

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:54.879
I will always be here for you.

01:24:59.518 --> 01:25:01.285
- Hey.
- Hmm?

01:25:17.333 --> 01:25:18.567
Eliza...

01:25:19.169 --> 01:25:20.469
Jude, Jude...

01:25:20.471 --> 01:25:23.771
- Stop.
- No, I wanna be with you.

01:25:25.374 --> 01:25:27.108
Jude, Jude...

01:25:27.376 --> 01:25:29.444
Do you really want to lose
your virginity

01:25:29.446 --> 01:25:32.712
to some messed up, pregnant
girl in a green house?

01:25:33.214 --> 01:25:34.481
Yeah.

01:25:36.417 --> 01:25:40.187
Wait, what makes you think
I'm a virgin?

01:25:41.389 --> 01:25:44.023
Teddy told me you both were.

01:25:47.461 --> 01:25:49.228
Thanks, Teddy.

01:25:52.798 --> 01:25:54.766
Oh, God.

01:25:57.536 --> 01:25:59.771
Sorry.

01:25:59.872 --> 01:26:01.371
Oh, Jude...

01:26:06.144 --> 01:26:08.212
So, how long
will you be gone?

01:26:08.214 --> 01:26:10.446
I don't know. I just
need to confront Johnny

01:26:10.448 --> 01:26:11.481
and then I'll decide.

01:26:11.483 --> 01:26:13.015
I can't just sit
around here anymore.

01:26:13.017 --> 01:26:16.319
- But you'll come back before?
- Yes, I will.

01:26:16.321 --> 01:26:17.253
Whether he wants it or not,

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:20.322
I want you, of all people,
to be there when it happens.

01:26:22.859 --> 01:26:24.960
That means the world
to me, hon.

01:26:27.029 --> 01:26:28.563
Thank you.

01:26:30.699 --> 01:26:34.308
You'll come back soon? So I can
tell you how very proud of you I am.

01:26:34.769 --> 01:26:36.370
I will, Mom.

01:27:00.726 --> 01:27:01.959
Hello?

01:27:01.961 --> 01:27:02.760
Harriet?

01:27:02.762 --> 01:27:04.929
- Mmm-hmm.
- Diane.

01:27:06.131 --> 01:27:07.498
Diane Caplan.

01:27:08.699 --> 01:27:11.268
Oh, shit!

01:27:12.403 --> 01:27:16.173
So, I'm sure you've heard
that I was against all this.

01:27:16.175 --> 01:27:17.240
But I'm...

01:27:17.242 --> 01:27:19.308
I've had some time
to think about it now

01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:20.943
and I'm prepared to accept it,

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:25.347
and to help her in
whatever way she needs.

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:28.383
That's what I came
to tell her.

01:27:28.385 --> 01:27:29.384
Well, I feel awful.

01:27:29.386 --> 01:27:33.222
It didn't occur to me that you
would actually come, when I called.

01:27:33.257 --> 01:27:35.256
I just wanted you to know
how much she missed you.

01:27:35.258 --> 01:27:37.958
No, you were just trying
to help. I...

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.527
I'm famous for my bad timing.

01:27:40.529 --> 01:27:41.962
I actually would have
been here sooner

01:27:41.964 --> 01:27:43.230
but I was terrified of
driving myself and...

01:27:43.232 --> 01:27:45.399
God, that must sound so silly
to a woman like you, but...

01:27:45.401 --> 01:27:47.033
I didn't want Les
to bring me here

01:27:47.035 --> 01:27:49.468
because I thought
that might be, um...

01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:51.470
You know... Awkward.

01:27:51.472 --> 01:27:53.940
That could be awkward.

01:27:53.942 --> 01:27:55.840
Little bit.

01:27:56.008 --> 01:27:56.841
Well, I'm curious,

01:27:56.843 --> 01:27:59.578
you just said,
"A woman like you. "

01:28:00.213 --> 01:28:02.113
Uh, what did you mean by that?

01:28:02.115 --> 01:28:03.615
No! I didn't mean...

01:28:03.617 --> 01:28:06.550
God, no. I, I just
meant that you, you...

01:28:06.552 --> 01:28:08.485
Strike me as
somebody who's, um...

01:28:08.487 --> 01:28:10.221
You know, who's hardy.

01:28:10.223 --> 01:28:15.039
- Ha, that sounds like a polite
way of saying bumpkin. - Gosh!

01:28:15.427 --> 01:28:17.694
- I've insulted you already, haven't I?
- No, no. It's fine.

01:28:17.696 --> 01:28:20.763
I am a bit of a bumpkin, and I'm
hardy too. It's okay, it's okay.

01:28:20.765 --> 01:28:25.267
But you know what, believe it or not,
I don't drive either.

01:28:25.269 --> 01:28:27.269
- Really?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:28:27.437 --> 01:28:29.271
God, how do you
manage that out here?

01:28:29.273 --> 01:28:31.873
You're in the middle
of nowhere.

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:33.108
Wow!

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:45.952
What's so funny?

01:28:50.057 --> 01:28:53.826
Do you think that when
we get older and...

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.929
We've, like, drifted
apart 'cause...

01:28:57.497 --> 01:29:00.833
Let's face it, the odds
are that we will, right?

01:29:01.668 --> 01:29:06.204
Will you remember me as the most
fucked up girl you ever knew?

01:29:09.875 --> 01:29:11.109
Hmm.

01:29:11.111 --> 01:29:12.743
I would.

01:29:23.186 --> 01:29:24.020
<i>And in the East Village</i>

01:29:24.022 --> 01:29:26.622
<i>the police set up a perimeter
around Tompkins Square Park</i>

01:29:26.624 --> 01:29:30.459
<i>in anticipation of a clash over
the community board's new rule.</i>

01:29:30.461 --> 01:29:32.794
<i>Angry locals blame
gentrification...</i>

01:29:32.796 --> 01:29:34.596
Just leave us off here.

01:29:43.905 --> 01:29:45.272
Excuse me?

01:29:46.641 --> 01:29:47.696
What is all this?

01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:50.210
Fucking mayor wants a curfew in
the park to get rid of the homeless.

01:29:50.212 --> 01:29:52.578
But we know he wants
to get rid of us too.

01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:55.348
Come on, let's get
out of here.

01:29:55.582 --> 01:29:58.785
I really don't know how to thank
you for everything you've done.

01:29:58.787 --> 01:30:00.652
I feel like I should offer
you money or something.

01:30:00.654 --> 01:30:03.355
Don't be silly, I've enjoyed
having Eliza here.

01:30:03.357 --> 01:30:05.290
I think it was good for me.

01:30:05.292 --> 01:30:06.858
In what way?

01:30:07.593 --> 01:30:09.795
I don't know, really. I...

01:30:10.762 --> 01:30:15.766
I suspect it had something to do
with the idea of Jude's birth mother.

01:30:15.768 --> 01:30:18.736
She was apparently
the exact same age.

01:30:18.738 --> 01:30:20.937
- Was she?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:30:21.272 --> 01:30:23.306
What happened to her?

01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:26.343
I don't know.

01:30:32.215 --> 01:30:34.950
I do think that even
with all this mess

01:30:34.952 --> 01:30:36.251
we've somehow managed
to raise spirited,

01:30:36.253 --> 01:30:38.520
- smart kids, you know?
- Right, in spite of ourselves.

01:30:38.522 --> 01:30:40.488
Yes, and especially

01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:42.990
- despite Lester.
- Yeah.

01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:51.565
Hey, Mr. Clean.
Come on in, there.

01:30:52.266 --> 01:30:54.234
- Yeah.
- Hi.

01:30:54.335 --> 01:30:57.604
Okay, I, uh, I
organized this little soiree.

01:30:57.606 --> 01:30:58.571
Have a seat, uh...

01:30:58.573 --> 01:31:01.073
These two showed up
at my doorstep.

01:31:01.075 --> 01:31:03.676
And it seemed like
there was some serious air

01:31:03.678 --> 01:31:06.779
- that needed to be cleared.
- Yeah, I know.

01:31:07.547 --> 01:31:09.280
You haven't called us
for two weeks.

01:31:09.282 --> 01:31:11.082
You really think
that's acceptable?

01:31:11.084 --> 01:31:12.917
Only because I needed to wait.

01:31:12.919 --> 01:31:15.720
For what, Johnny?
For the baby to be born?

01:31:15.722 --> 01:31:18.088
No. To be 100% sure,

01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:20.124
but now I am.

01:31:20.126 --> 01:31:22.926
So I'm really glad
you're both here.

01:31:22.928 --> 01:31:24.528
Sure about what?

01:31:36.773 --> 01:31:38.540
What is this?

01:31:38.808 --> 01:31:41.977
That's Ravi Milan
and his wife, Arpeeta.

01:31:41.979 --> 01:31:43.378
Ravi's a lawyer.

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.180
Why do we need a lawyer?

01:31:45.882 --> 01:31:48.449
Ravi's also Teddy's dad.

01:31:49.384 --> 01:31:52.386
I knew, I knew from my mom
he was in New York somewhere

01:31:52.388 --> 01:31:53.387
but I, I never
attempted to find him.

01:31:53.389 --> 01:31:57.123
I, I always figured that Teddy
would do that someday, but...

01:31:57.125 --> 01:31:59.025
You know, lately,
it occurred to me

01:31:59.027 --> 01:32:02.295
that Teddy's dad might be able
to help us out with money.

01:32:02.297 --> 01:32:04.464
You know, for the baby.

01:32:04.466 --> 01:32:06.865
And, and after having
finally met him,

01:32:06.867 --> 01:32:10.636
I think he can help us out
with so much more.

01:32:10.638 --> 01:32:12.070
Like what?

01:32:13.473 --> 01:32:14.806
Well...

01:32:14.808 --> 01:32:16.574
Like with a home.

01:32:17.109 --> 01:32:18.943
What're you saying?

01:32:19.178 --> 01:32:21.379
The Milans, they have
no children.

01:32:21.381 --> 01:32:22.780
When I spoke to Ravi

01:32:22.782 --> 01:32:24.848
he was crushed by what
happened to Teddy.

01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:27.217
He felt like he completely
missed out on the chance

01:32:27.219 --> 01:32:30.187
to ever get to know him
because of my mom's insanity.

01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:31.038
What're you saying?

01:32:31.073 --> 01:32:36.158
Adoption is something the Milans
have discussed for some time now.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.327
Oh, my God.

01:32:38.595 --> 01:32:41.330
This is what you've wanted
the whole time, isn't it?

01:32:41.332 --> 01:32:42.264
- No, no.
- Isn't it?

01:32:42.266 --> 01:32:44.866
Well, why didn't you just fuckin'
say so from the beginning?

01:32:44.868 --> 01:32:47.535
- Why did you have to put me
through all this? - Whoa, whoa...

01:32:47.537 --> 01:32:48.903
Eliza, Eliza, what I wanted

01:32:48.905 --> 01:32:52.540
was for Teddy's child
to be with family.

01:32:52.542 --> 01:32:55.213
- Teddy's child?
- Teddy's child.

01:32:55.248 --> 01:32:57.344
- At the time I thought that that could
only mean me. - It's Teddy's child?

01:32:57.346 --> 01:32:59.780
I can't believe this.
I can't fuckin' believe this.

01:32:59.782 --> 01:33:02.982
But Ravi has so much more
to offer a child than us.

01:33:02.984 --> 01:33:07.186
It's everything
we wanna give Annabelle.

01:33:07.188 --> 01:33:08.955
But better.

01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:12.291
I can't believe this.

01:33:12.725 --> 01:33:13.425
Oh!

01:33:13.427 --> 01:33:15.427
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Hey, Jude...

01:33:15.429 --> 01:33:19.064
You're a fraud! He just wants
to be with his fuckin' boyfriend.

01:33:19.066 --> 01:33:20.298
He wants to run to California,

01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.333
just toss Eliza and
the baby aside.

01:33:22.335 --> 01:33:24.268
- That's not how it is.
- Tell the truth!

01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:25.469
Jude, hey, hey.

01:33:25.471 --> 01:33:27.338
Fuckin' liar!

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:28.309
Eliza!

01:33:28.344 --> 01:33:30.841
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:33:45.154 --> 01:33:47.890
I don't really know
what's going on.

01:33:47.892 --> 01:33:49.791
Jude is right.

01:33:50.426 --> 01:33:52.226
I've fucked everything up.

01:33:52.561 --> 01:33:56.097
All I wanted was to finally
do right by Teddy.

01:33:56.431 --> 01:33:58.866
We say fuck you!
We say fuck you!

01:33:58.868 --> 01:34:00.234
Eliza!

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:04.971
We say fuck you!
We say fuck you!

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:08.875
Eliza!

01:34:15.515 --> 01:34:16.782
Eliza!

01:34:20.052 --> 01:34:22.420
I have the
right to be here!

01:34:32.764 --> 01:34:33.997
Eliza!

01:34:35.366 --> 01:34:36.700
Eliza!

01:34:43.807 --> 01:34:45.308
Get back here!

01:34:58.553 --> 01:34:59.820
Hey, hey!

01:34:59.822 --> 01:35:01.188
<i>Eliza!</i>

01:35:02.924 --> 01:35:04.158
Asshole!

01:35:08.162 --> 01:35:10.096
Hey, Eliza! Are you okay?

01:35:10.098 --> 01:35:11.864
All right, watch out, all right?
She's pregnant!

01:35:11.866 --> 01:35:16.102
- Nobody gets to lay a claim on
this baby but me, Jude. - I know.

01:35:16.104 --> 01:35:17.469
Nobody!

01:35:18.705 --> 01:35:20.205
I wanted to have a family.

01:35:20.207 --> 01:35:23.041
Just a family, a good family
who wants a baby,

01:35:23.043 --> 01:35:24.409
not people trying to
bring Teddy back,

01:35:24.411 --> 01:35:26.744
not some long-lost father
who's trying to make up

01:35:26.746 --> 01:35:28.579
- for his shitty past, okay?
- I know.

01:35:28.581 --> 01:35:30.581
I just want a family,
that's all I want!

01:35:30.583 --> 01:35:34.035
Whatever you want,
that's what we'll do. Okay?

01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:36.786
Now let's just get
the fuck out of here.

01:36:03.245 --> 01:36:04.412
Is the baby okay?

01:36:04.414 --> 01:36:08.248
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
the patient speaks.

01:36:09.317 --> 01:36:11.885
Baby's right as rain,
sweetheart.

01:36:12.487 --> 01:36:13.920
How are you?

01:36:13.922 --> 01:36:16.922
Oh, I kept my eyes shut
tight the whole time.

01:36:17.024 --> 01:36:18.624
I didn't want
to see anything.

01:36:18.626 --> 01:36:21.927
- Then I asked for them to give
me something to sleep. - Mmm.

01:36:21.929 --> 01:36:23.829
You know, you've been
asleep for seven years.

01:36:23.831 --> 01:36:26.264
- This is your fourth child.
- Stop it, Lester.

01:36:26.266 --> 01:36:28.633
It's okay, Harriet.

01:36:28.635 --> 01:36:30.335
He means well.

01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:35.567
Sweetheart, the nurse wants to
know if you'd like to hold the baby.

01:36:39.444 --> 01:36:42.680
They say it's too easy
to fall in love.

01:36:44.782 --> 01:36:46.549
Are you sure?

01:36:50.354 --> 01:36:51.587
Yeah.

01:36:53.056 --> 01:36:54.856
But I want Jude to.

01:36:58.995 --> 01:37:00.295
Now?

01:37:01.764 --> 01:37:02.997
Yeah.

01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.001
Follow me, Jude.

01:37:15.242 --> 01:37:16.609
Oh, my girl.

01:37:17.278 --> 01:37:19.279
My brave, brave girl.

01:37:32.958 --> 01:37:34.559
You know, I was
thinking that, uh...

01:37:34.561 --> 01:37:37.895
You know, if you wanna be
we could be roommates again.

01:37:37.897 --> 01:37:39.297
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:39.299 --> 01:37:41.598
I got a lead on
an apartment that...

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:45.102
Looks like it could be a lot bigger,
you know, two rooms.

01:37:45.104 --> 01:37:46.369
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.
- Hmm.

01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:49.606
If a guy's gonna get his shit together,
you know, he needs a little space.

01:37:49.608 --> 01:37:51.807
And I'm speaking
for both of us.

01:37:51.809 --> 01:37:53.309
Here it is.

01:37:59.282 --> 01:38:02.083
I always thought
he'd look like Teddy.

01:38:03.652 --> 01:38:06.588
He doesn't look
like Eliza either.

01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:10.557
He just looks like himself.

01:38:13.094 --> 01:38:15.763
You think I'll ever
see him after this?

01:38:21.068 --> 01:38:25.738
In 10 years, he's going to be
a completely different person.

01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:28.241
And so are you, champ.

01:38:30.476 --> 01:38:33.011
Go in there. Go say hi.

01:38:38.284 --> 01:38:39.600
There you go.

01:38:39.635 --> 01:38:42.253
Make sure to
support his head.

01:38:48.125 --> 01:38:49.793
It's okay.

01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:48.812
<i>If Teddy hadn't
left us for good,</i>

01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:52.950
<i>if he was still somewhere
up there, 10 years later</i>

01:39:52.952 --> 01:39:57.353
<i>hovering above the city in
the troposphere of the earth,</i>

01:39:57.588 --> 01:40:00.957
<i>he'd see a little part
transformed.</i>

01:40:02.492 --> 01:40:04.794
<i>He'd find Eliza in Brooklyn,</i>

01:40:04.796 --> 01:40:06.394
<i>starting her own family.</i>

01:40:06.396 --> 01:40:09.164
<i>And his best friend,
believe it or not,</i>

01:40:09.166 --> 01:40:12.667
<i>about to become
a father himself.</i>

01:40:14.136 --> 01:40:16.837
<i>He'd know that he had
not been forgotten</i>

01:40:16.839 --> 01:40:18.672
<i>even if the outlines
of his face</i>

01:40:18.674 --> 01:40:22.142
<i>grow fuzzier with
each passing year.</i>

01:40:23.111 --> 01:40:24.611
<i>Maybe he'd also see</i>

01:40:24.613 --> 01:40:27.680
<i>how fragile each
and every life is.</i>

01:40:27.682 --> 01:40:31.384
<i>And that they all just fall
to earth and scatter</i>

01:40:31.386 --> 01:40:34.486
<i>hoping to settle
somewhere and stick</i>

01:40:35.355 --> 01:40:38.190
<i>like big, dry snowflakes</i>

01:40:38.458 --> 01:40:40.792
<i>from a white Vermont sky.</i>
