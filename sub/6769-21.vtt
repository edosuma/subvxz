00:02.168 --> 00:04.921
{\an5}DYLAN:
You should've seen me and Matt
at the pool hall last night.

00:05.004 --> 00:07.257
{\an5}Wow. A thousand bucks
just like that?
Sweet.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.760
{\an5}MATT:
Mikey's an ex-client
of mine who wouldn't pay.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.053
{\an3}You know, I've got
some dice in my purse.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.889
We could go out back and take
some kids for their lunch money.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.225
MATT:
The guy was scamming me.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.601
I had to beat him
at his own game.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.603
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:20.687 --> 00:24.107
Okay, this one's on Mikey.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.317
Get out of here. All right,
I'm getting a coffee to go.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.694
MATT:
Excuse me.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.654
{\an3}You know what? You
are a bad influence.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.281
Yeah. Isn't it great?

00:31.364 --> 00:33.450
{\an1}Are you going to
finish those eggs?

00:33.533 --> 00:35.076
Actually, no. I'm late.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.453
Remember, I told you
Oksana's in town.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.246
We're going to hang out
at her beach house today.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.122
{\an3}Oksana?

00:39.205 --> 00:41.124
As in Oksana Baiul?

00:41.207 --> 00:42.125
{\an3}Yeah. We used to
train together

00:42.208 --> 00:43.001
after she won the gold

00:43.084 --> 00:45.003
at Lillehammer.
See, I was actually, um,

00:45.086 --> 00:46.755
thinking that Matt
and I would go back

00:46.838 --> 00:50.341
to the pool hall tonight, you
know, and you two could come.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.302
Mm. A double date.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.596
{\an6}Mm.
Mm, me without
my poodle skirt.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.140
Look, if Oksana
and I don't go

00:57.223 --> 00:59.309
{\an3}to Cherry, then
maybe I'll stop by.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.643
{\an1}DYLAN:
Yeah, right.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.857
(clears throat)
She'll be there.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.443
There you go.

01:08.526 --> 01:09.611
Thanks, Nat.

01:09.694 --> 01:10.820
MAN:
A little more mud over here?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.822
{\an3}Sure.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.199
There you go.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.411
Sonny Sharp,
the morning DJ.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.372
(laughing)

01:21.456 --> 01:22.832
I can't believe this.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.125
I'm David Silver.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.127
{\an3}I used to listen to
your show every morning

01:26.211 --> 01:27.253
before high school.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.838
{\an3}Last I heard, you
were in, um...

01:28.922 --> 01:29.964
Des Moines.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.341
{\an3}Des Moines.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.052
When disc jockeys mature,
that's where they go.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.845
Right.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.138
So, what are you doing back?

01:37.222 --> 01:40.141
Uh, I've got an afternoon gig at
a little station in Riverside.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.142
It's a temporary thing.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.019
A lot of fun.

01:43.102 --> 01:44.437
Your last show that aired...

01:44.521 --> 01:47.482
{\an3}I skipped three classes
just to hear it.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.234
{\an3}You're one of the reasons
I got into radio.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.277
Is somebody paying you?

01:51.361 --> 01:54.030
(laughing):
No.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.573
(both laughing)

01:55.657 --> 01:58.993
{\an3}Listen, I have a...
at the club next door.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.037
{\an3}I do a radio show, you know?
It's, like, dance music

02:01.120 --> 02:02.664
and interviews
and phone-ins.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.666
It's a lot of fun.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.084
{\an3}Maybe you'd want to come
and do it sometime.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.168
Sure, kid.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.378
{\an3}How about later on tonight?
Maybe around 10:00?

02:09.461 --> 02:12.173
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.383
{\an3}Okay.
Great.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.425
Sonny Sharp.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.846
All right. So, I'll s... Okay.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.722
(entry bell rings)

02:19.806 --> 02:21.558
{\an3}And before you start planning
a summer road trip,

02:21.641 --> 02:22.684
for the four of us,
I have to tell you,

02:22.767 --> 02:24.936
{\an3}this is a little weird,
you and Matt buddying up.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.021
(laughing)
Let me tell you something.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.984
First of all, I don't buddy up,
and B) the guy needed a favor.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.278
Still, it's like
worlds colliding.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.904
I'll race you
to the fallout shelter.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.286
What did I miss?

02:45.164 --> 02:46.583
DONNA:
So, we totally sold out

02:46.666 --> 02:48.626
of the satin skirts,
and everyone really likes...

02:48.710 --> 02:50.628
Damn it. I've told
Olympia 50 times,

02:50.712 --> 02:52.755
"No mini marshmallows
in the fruit salad."

02:52.839 --> 02:54.257
I like it that way.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.176
Go ahead. That's wonderful.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.096
And Tish Leventhal wants
to give us an exclusive

03:00.179 --> 03:01.431
on her new jewelry line.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.391
{\an3}Excellent.
What's next?

03:03.474 --> 03:05.226
Bologna
on white bread for lunch?

03:05.310 --> 03:07.353
Just pick them out, Felice.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.189
Now, let Donna finish, please.

03:12.191 --> 03:15.653
Okay, um,
and here's the best part.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.238
Here's the money
that you loaned us

03:17.322 --> 03:19.282
{\an1}for the boutique renovations,
plus interest.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.992
And don't tell me
you're not taking it,

03:21.075 --> 03:22.368
because Kelly will
just write you another check.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.454
Oh, no. I'm taking it.
I'll take it.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.623
I may not cash it,
but I'll take it.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.124
Honoring obligations.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.585
Keeping business business.
I'm very impressed.

03:30.668 --> 03:31.628
Thank you.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.087
It's not possible.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.505
What happened to the little girl

03:34.589 --> 03:37.842
who once put two contacts
in the same eye?

03:37.926 --> 03:39.594
Don't remind me.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.137
She's an adult.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.722
Yeah, she is.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.433
{\an3}What?

03:45.516 --> 03:47.518
Oh, no. Don't tell me
it's finally time

03:47.602 --> 03:49.103
to clean out my high-school
bedroom, because that's

03:49.187 --> 03:50.271
going to take a while.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.314
{\an1}DR. MARTIN:
No.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.692
It means that you can handle
some difficult news.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.613
Your father and I
are separating.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.290
♪ ♪

04:36.067 --> 04:38.069
♪ ♪

05:01.968 --> 05:03.845
♪ ♪

05:10.393 --> 05:11.394
♪ ♪

05:49.682 --> 05:51.059
Okay, um...

05:51.142 --> 05:52.435
These are going
to the shelter,

05:52.518 --> 05:55.438
{\an3}and I've organized all
of your shoes, so...

05:55.521 --> 05:57.440
{\an1}You've cleaned
the beach apartment,

05:57.523 --> 06:00.109
you've balanced your checkbook,
and you've washed both our cars.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.779
Yeah, well I'm, I'm worried,

06:02.862 --> 06:03.905
{\an3}and when I'm worried,
I like to...

06:03.988 --> 06:05.281
{\an1}Organize.
Yeah.

06:05.364 --> 06:07.450
{\an1}I know.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.369
It's just, if I, um, slow down,

06:10.453 --> 06:12.622
{\an3}I might realize how much
this actually hurts.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.124
{\an3}They've been married
for 25 years.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.168
{\an3}How do you just go
and throw that away?

06:17.251 --> 06:18.503
I don't know.

06:18.586 --> 06:21.089
{\an1}They didn't give you
any reasons, huh?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.883
{\an3}I guess I was too shocked
to probe for details.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.763
Look, I'm sorry.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.139
(sighs)

06:30.223 --> 06:33.476
And it's awful
to even think this,

06:33.559 --> 06:37.480
but I just know
that it's my mother's fault.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.316
She's overbearing
and she's bossy.

06:40.399 --> 06:45.154
And back
when I was in high school,

06:45.238 --> 06:47.156
I actually caught her
having an affair.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.618
I don't even want
to think about this.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.453
Look, you got to talk to them.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.164
I'm just afraid
of what they might say.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.044
{\an1}Well, it is magic night
at the club tomorrow.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.838
(both laugh)

07:01.921 --> 07:04.340
You can go backstage.
You can saw me in half

07:04.423 --> 07:05.341
if it makes you feel better.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.009
{\an1}Hmm?

07:07.093 --> 07:10.388
Well, as tempting
as that sounds...

07:10.471 --> 07:13.349
{\an3}(sighing):
I need to deal with this.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.434
Starting with my mother.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.360
So, the acceptance letter
from Harvard came today?

07:24.443 --> 07:27.363
{\an1}Along with the ones from Yale,
Brown and Northwestern.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.906
{\an3}Wow.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.032
{\an3}That's in Evanston,
Illinois.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.284
What about CU?

07:31.367 --> 07:33.744
Oh, uh...
Peter doesn't do state schools.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.539
Berkley's passable,
but I'm not in love

07:36.622 --> 07:38.124
with their neuropsych
department.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.918
So, what do you think about

07:41.002 --> 07:42.587
this headline for our story?

07:42.670 --> 07:44.338
"The 11-Year-Old Freshman."

07:44.422 --> 07:45.882
Sophomore.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.508
I have AP credits.
Oh.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.218
Do you know who the Lakers are?

07:51.679 --> 07:54.182
I'm sorry you have to work
with such a dullard.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.434
(chuckles)

07:57.476 --> 07:59.520
Thank you.
Bye.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.732
Amazing.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.108
No, it's disgusting.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.776
{\an3}The kid's not
allowed to be a kid.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.403
He's missing out
on all the fun.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.280
{\an1}Peter is a kid.
He's just special.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.741
And you're just jealous.
Jealous?

08:11.824 --> 08:15.494
I could whup that kid in
any video game I wanted.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.415
Dullard.

08:19.498 --> 08:20.458
It's with a "D."

08:32.678 --> 08:35.056
{\an1}Gina? K.T. Liss.
Right.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.765
{\an1}Oksana's assistant.
You're late.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.267
And you're an assistant.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.936
{\an3}(laughing)
Where's Oksana?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.102
Rehearsing in Montreal.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.772
{\an1}She's sorry
she couldn't be here.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.232
{\an1}You know how crazy
those shows can get.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.275
Yeah, I have a vague
recollection.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.237
{\an1}Anyway, thanks in advance
for doing this.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.155
{\an1}My first vacation
in three years.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.156
{\an1}You ever been
to South Beach?

08:52.240 --> 08:53.366
Yeah. It's humid.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.243
Great for the skin.
So, here's the deal.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.452
{\an1}No guests.

08:56.535 --> 08:57.954
You can sleep in the house,

08:58.037 --> 08:59.538
{\an1}but you've got
to bring your own sheets.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.290
{\an1}Water the plants
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.292
Feed the fish every night.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.460
{\an1}Uh, Mercedes:
strictly off-limits,

09:04.543 --> 09:05.753
{\an1}unless, of course,
there's an emergency.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.672
{\an1}Then the keys
are in the kitchen.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.423
{\an1}Um, I'm not leaving
till day after tomorrow,

09:09.507 --> 09:11.300
so I will check in

09:11.384 --> 09:13.135
{\an1}and make sure
all the gears are greased.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.553
Thanks again.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.139
{\an1}Okay, now, let's be really
clear about this.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.350
{\an1}I'm doing this
as a favor to Oksana.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.143
And it's so sweet of you.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.521
{\an1}Do not treat me
like an employee!

09:23.604 --> 09:27.316
Well, technically, you are.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.323
SONNY:
I remember this.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.950
{\an1}Up all night.
Dancing like crazy.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.159
Right.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.327
Hey, that reminds me,

09:38.411 --> 09:39.370
{\an3}did you ever have
any problems sleeping

09:39.453 --> 09:41.163
{\an3}because of ringing
in your ears?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.291
What? Joking.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.333
{\an3}(laughs)

09:44.417 --> 09:47.628
{\an1}Remind me to bring in
a better screen for that mic.

09:47.712 --> 09:48.921
{\an1}You're popping
all over the place.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.301
{\an3}Okay, people,
I would really love

09:53.384 --> 09:55.177
{\an3}to thank my partner
in crime this evening,

09:55.261 --> 09:56.220
Mr. Sonny Sharp,
for being here.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.471
Thank you, sir.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.140
My pleasure.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.725
{\an3}Do you have any brilliant
parting words of wisdom

10:00.808 --> 10:02.768
{\an3}for our young
audience out there?

10:02.852 --> 10:05.688
{\an1}Uh...
'fraid I don't have any.

10:05.771 --> 10:10.359
{\an3}Okay. Uh, well...
(laughs)

10:10.443 --> 10:13.571
{\an3}Anyone that remembers
Sonny's shows from years past,

10:13.654 --> 10:18.242
knows that he ended
each one with this.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.243
(flips switch)

10:19.327 --> 10:20.870
Sonny, come back any time.

10:20.953 --> 10:26.167
♪ Somewhere there's a girl
who I could love... ♪

10:30.463 --> 10:31.797
Take it easy, Kel.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.215
{\an1}Tequila shot
and a beer, please.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.051
{\an3}What, were you
practicing sit spins?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.011
{\an3}I was getting ready
to get a new partner.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.729
{\an3}How about little girls
against boys?

10:46.812 --> 10:48.230
Looks like we're
back in business.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.274
Just like last night?

10:51.442 --> 10:54.278
{\an1}You jerked us around.
We want our money back.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.113
{\an3}Come on. I mean, what
did your mother tell you

10:56.197 --> 10:57.573
{\an3}about being such
sore losers?

10:57.656 --> 10:58.908
{\an1}She told us
to kill the winners.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.076
How do you feel about that?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.744
{\an3}Uh...
He likes it.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.454
{\an3}(glass breaking)
Hey, Mikey.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.749
(women shrieking)

11:06.832 --> 11:08.292
(punches landing, man groans)

11:11.504 --> 11:13.881
(fists smacking, man grunting)

11:13.964 --> 11:15.966
(glass shattering)

11:17.676 --> 11:18.969
Good.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.513
(punches landing, man grunting)

11:21.847 --> 11:24.266
{\an5}DAVID:
So, Sonny, I was thinking of
coming down to Riverside.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.436
You know, seeing how you do
what you do, if that's cool.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.437
Shouldn't be a problem.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.231
{\an3}Cool.
(knocking)

11:30.314 --> 11:31.190
{\an3}Rick.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.192
Hey, uh, Sonny, this is,
this is Rick Miller.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.193
This is my station manager.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.903
{\an1}Hear that?

11:35.986 --> 11:37.279
It's the sound of radio dials

11:37.363 --> 11:38.489
{\an1}being switched
all over the city.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.074
And I don't want to speak

11:40.157 --> 11:42.410
for the After Dark, but I'm sure
they don't appreciate

11:42.493 --> 11:43.869
having an empty dance floor.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.913
Look the song was my idea.

11:45.996 --> 11:49.083
{\an1}Then I suggest you get
back to your bingo game.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.293
{\an1}And you'd better start playing
some music from this decade.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.503
Now!

11:55.256 --> 11:57.425
A real fun guy.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.676
{\an1}Look, I...

11:58.759 --> 12:00.636
I... I gotta go.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.054
Son...

12:07.726 --> 12:09.395
You want my coleslaw?
Hmm.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.357
Your father always asks me that.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.485
Well, he's already
found an apartment.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.863
{\an1}He wants to take
the leather couches

12:18.946 --> 12:20.322
from the den.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.490
The ones I picked out.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.492
Mom, don't fight over couches.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.662
He'd just better realize I'm not
giving up the club membership.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.372
{\an3}Thank you.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.499
{\an3}Do you know how selfish
you sound?

12:30.583 --> 12:33.043
God, it's always about you.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.004
Don't talk to me like that.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.338
Do you remember that time

12:36.422 --> 12:37.506
that I caught you in the
Bel Age with that man?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.341
Donna, I've heard enough.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.178
No, I, I never asked you what
was wrong with your marriage.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.305
{\an3}You and Dad just
fixed the problem.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.349
Ever since then, every fight
that you two have,

12:47.433 --> 12:48.559
every argument you...

12:48.642 --> 12:50.519
What? I'm to blame for this?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.855
Well, you put the first nail
in the coffin.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.485
And you call me selfish?

12:57.568 --> 12:59.904
Well, maybe it's because

12:59.987 --> 13:02.364
I'm in this marriage
all by myself.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.741
You know, for the
last two months,

13:03.824 --> 13:07.536
my husband has
completely shut me out.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.079
He won't talk to me.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.498
He comes home
from the office late.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.376
Your father wants
this separation.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.004
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.214
Yeah, well, so am I.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.509
But if your goal in this whole
mess is to point fingers,

13:21.592 --> 13:23.552
I think you need to start
with your father.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.222
I'm gonna go.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.306
Mom...

13:38.692 --> 13:41.237
{\an5}STEVE:
It's like two pages.
If you increase the margins,

13:41.320 --> 13:42.238
it should fit, right?
Yeah.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.531
Okay, so we can do it.
Hi.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.115
Hi.
Hi.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.117
{\an1}A small token of
Peter's gratitude.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.078
{\an3}Oh, it's a calendar.
How nice.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.122
Whoa, not just a calendar,
a Peter calendar.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.124
{\an1}How useful.
We just so appreciate

13:54.208 --> 13:56.085
that article you wrote
about him.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.711
It's led to a virtual
media onslaught.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.089
{\an1}Beating them back
with a stick, are you?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.132
Actually, they're still
on Peter's tail.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.760
Right now, he's doing
an interview for the local news.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.720
Oh, that's wonderful.
Obviously, the masses

14:06.804 --> 14:08.931
want to learn about
special people like Peter.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.475
{\an1}Oh, speaking
of learning, uh...

14:11.559 --> 14:15.771
{\an1}Ooh, do you know anything
about this magic show?

14:15.854 --> 14:18.566
{\an3}Oh, yeah, actually a couple
of our friends are running it.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.943
Peter saw this ad,
and he just begged to go.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.113
It's a shame, because
I have plans tonight.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.157
See, magic is such a challenging
brain teaser for Peter.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.785
Well, really they're not such
good friends of ours, and...

14:29.868 --> 14:31.078
{\an3}JANET:
But we'd love to take him.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.999
{\an3}So, um, just drop him by
like around 5:00.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.292
Thank you.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.169
Peter will be so excited.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.423
Bye.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.924
(door opens)

14:58.355 --> 15:00.983
Hi. Sweetheart, I-I was...

15:01.066 --> 15:03.360
{\an1}Yeah, just moving out.
I can see.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.613
New car?

15:05.696 --> 15:08.657
{\an3}Yeah, yeah. I've really
always wanted a convertible.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.117
{\an1}It's nice.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.453
That's funny, 'cause I could've
sworn you told me

15:12.536 --> 15:13.537
convertibles were dangerous.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.164
I guess I've changed my mind.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.333
Noah, would you help me with
those boxes over there, please?

15:17.416 --> 15:20.753
No, no, we're not helping him
walk out on this family.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.796
I'd better go.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.049
{\an3}I hope that you're off
to get some help.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.970
Could you excuse us, please?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.347
Sure.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.310
You care to explain
that little outburst?

15:36.393 --> 15:38.312
Are you talking to someone
about this?

15:38.395 --> 15:40.481
Because Mom and I-- we're
completely in the dark here.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.191
Dad, what's going on?

15:42.274 --> 15:44.026
{\an1}You got a new car,
a new apartment.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.903
Is there a new girlfriend, too?

15:45.986 --> 15:47.613
{\an3}Look, I know this is
tearing you apart.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.366
I know that you need
some kind of explanation.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.742
Yeah, that's right.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.202
I don't have one. I'm sorry.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.912
That's not good enough.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.205
It's all I've got.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.049
That's the price you guys pay
for defending the honor of...

16:07.132 --> 16:09.218
{\an3}What were they defending
last night?

16:09.301 --> 16:11.053
{\an5}KELLY:
Pool hustling.
Easy.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.888
They were defending the
honor of pool hustling.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.682
{\an3}Oh, that's right,
but they can't help it,

16:14.765 --> 16:16.266
{\an3}'cause, you know,
when you're a Jet...

16:16.350 --> 16:17.393
So how long do you
have Oksana's car?

16:17.476 --> 16:20.229
Oh, as long as I want.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.022
Wow, I had no idea
you guys were so close.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.691
Oh, yeah, after the Olympics,
you know,

16:23.774 --> 16:24.858
we trained together

16:24.942 --> 16:27.528
and our coach
was so intense

16:27.611 --> 16:29.071
and we got really close.

16:29.154 --> 16:29.905
Oh.

16:29.988 --> 16:31.448
So you two are
really friends, huh?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.283
Is that a tough concept for you?

16:33.367 --> 16:34.451
For some reason?

16:34.535 --> 16:36.161
No, no.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.081
What, you need proof?

16:39.164 --> 16:40.124
{\an3}Well...
Huh?

16:40.207 --> 16:41.041
{\an3}You guys should come over
to the house tomorrow.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.085
{\an3}Oksana has this
really beautiful pool

16:43.168 --> 16:44.086
that overlooks the ocean.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.755
Oh, in that case, we need proof.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.257
Yeah.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.933
{\an5}MATT:
So what should I do, should I
try to get us a table or...?

16:58.016 --> 16:59.435
Actually I already have us one
up front there.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.269
You know, ownership
has its privileges.

17:00.352 --> 17:04.106
{\an1}This is Oksana's Red Arowana.
(gasps)

17:04.189 --> 17:05.232
And he's dead,

17:05.315 --> 17:07.443
because someone failed
to follow explicit instructions.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.609
{\an3}What is she
talking about?

17:08.694 --> 17:09.653
I just missed one
little feeding.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.738
It couldn't have
starved to death.

17:10.820 --> 17:11.530
I don't want to hear it.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.157
Now I have to cancel
my vacation.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.285
Well, it's a fish.
I'll just buy her a new one.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.662
It cost $3,000!

17:18.746 --> 17:20.955
{\an1}Oksana gave you
this job as a favor.

17:21.039 --> 17:22.124
She felt sorry for you,

17:22.207 --> 17:24.542
tanking your career so early.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.131
Why don't we just
take this outside?

17:29.214 --> 17:31.008
That Mercedes better
be back in the garage

17:31.091 --> 17:32.134
by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.429
{\an1}Oh, P.S.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.139
I put a stop payment
on your check.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.766
Tell me, Gina,

17:38.849 --> 17:41.310
are you mediocre
at everything you do,

17:41.393 --> 17:43.645
or is the list complete at
house-sitting and skating?

17:50.527 --> 17:52.613
What are you looking at?

18:01.163 --> 18:03.499
Father Ledley,
when Donna told me her plans

18:03.582 --> 18:05.375
to take over the first grade
Sunday school class,

18:05.459 --> 18:06.460
I was so proud.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.046
I didn't know Donna wanted
to teach Sunday school.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.507
I kind of made that up.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.302
You lied?

18:15.385 --> 18:17.721
{\an1}Yeah. And that's
why I would be

18:17.805 --> 18:19.848
{\an1}such a very bad influence
on the kids.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.060
Donna, what's going on?

18:23.143 --> 18:25.229
Well, it's just
you and Dad seem

18:25.312 --> 18:27.815
so unwilling to talk
about your problems.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.817
And I just figured

18:29.900 --> 18:31.401
that if there was an objective
third party there,

18:31.485 --> 18:32.778
someone that you guys
trusted, that maybe...

18:32.861 --> 18:35.072
I'm so embarrassed.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.573
{\an3}Father...
Don't be.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.033
Felice, I've counseled
couples for years.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.159
You know that.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.081
Well, I'm-- of course
I'm willing to try,

18:44.164 --> 18:46.708
but I just don't think
that John would agree to it.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.085
(doorbell ringing)

18:48.168 --> 18:50.254
That's probably Dad now.
What?!

18:50.337 --> 18:53.006
{\an1}Well, yeah, when I called
earlier to apologize to him,

18:53.090 --> 18:56.218
{\an1}I told him that I need help
hooking up my new stereo.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.427
{\an3}And you don't have
a new stereo.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.720
When I'm done
with these two,

18:58.804 --> 19:02.349
you and I are going to have a
little talk about deceit, Donna.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.101
Yes, Father.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.066
Hi.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.568
So, where's the ster...

19:15.153 --> 19:16.071
Hello, John.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.614
What is this?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.575
Dad, you and Mom need to talk.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.119
Ambushed by my own daughter.

19:24.705 --> 19:25.873
That's right, leave.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.916
{\an1}It seems to be
your new specialty.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.710
Very nice, Felice.
That's good!

19:31.295 --> 19:34.923
I asked you
to respect my privacy,

19:35.007 --> 19:36.717
not to violate it.

19:45.183 --> 19:47.102
{\an5}STEVE:
Can you show us this one,
Dr. Van Fertle?

19:47.185 --> 19:48.729
Ah, the Box of Death.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.647
{\an1}STEVE:
Box of Death, ooh.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.735
His assistant slips
into the top half.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.111
A string operates
the fake leg.

19:56.194 --> 19:56.778
Next.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.989
Yeah, okay kid.
(chuckling)

19:59.072 --> 20:00.449
{\an1}You leave it alone
or you'll be pulling

20:00.532 --> 20:02.075
{\an1}rabbit droppings out
of your hair for weeks.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.119
So you're also
a hypnotist?

20:04.202 --> 20:05.746
Yeah, oh, of course.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.123
{\an3}A person can't be hypnotized
if they don't want to be.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.292
Contrary to popular belief,

20:10.375 --> 20:12.294
the mind is quite resistant
to suggestion.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.171
Is it?

20:14.254 --> 20:17.090
{\an1}Watch carefully as I count
backwards from ten.

20:17.174 --> 20:20.594
{\an1}As I count, you will become
more and more relaxed.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.846
You will hear nothing
but the sound

20:22.930 --> 20:24.306
of my voice. Ten...

20:24.389 --> 20:26.600
{\an4}We gotta get this
kid out of here.
What? Why?

20:26.683 --> 20:28.310
{\an3}The show hasn't
even started yet.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.938
{\an4}STEVE:
But there might not be one
if little Mensa boy

20:31.021 --> 20:33.607
exposes any more of
Van Fertle's tricks.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.317
...three...
Fine.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.320
...two... one.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.157
You are completely relaxed.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.283
{\an1}JANET:
Hey, Peter,

20:43.367 --> 20:44.284
are you ready to go?

20:44.368 --> 20:45.327
Yeah.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.664
{\an1}Scat. You're nothing
but a dumb kid.

20:48.747 --> 20:52.167
Hey! Watch it, Van Fertle.

20:52.250 --> 20:56.630
{\an1}Was the kid right
about the Box of Death?

20:56.713 --> 20:58.757
Uh, sorry.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.178
Hey, thanks for coming.

21:03.261 --> 21:05.347
{\an3}I never miss a chance
for a free beer.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.556
What's up?

21:06.640 --> 21:09.810
{\an1}I just wanted to apologize
for yesterday.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.229
My station manager Rick can
be a little rude sometimes.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.522
Don't worry about it.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.148
It's radio.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.569
Listen, I didn't know
how else to find you

21:19.653 --> 21:21.905
so I went down to that
station in Riverside.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.365
They told me that

21:23.448 --> 21:25.283
you're not a deejay there.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.203
Well, it was just a
one-time guest shot.

21:28.286 --> 21:30.831
I thought I told you
about that.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.249
Actually, they said you
worked there full-time

21:32.332 --> 21:34.167
as the music librarian.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.502
Well, there you have it.

21:35.585 --> 21:36.753
What's going on, man?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.296
You're Sonny Sharp.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.381
You're emperor of the Airwaves.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.049
Yeah, I was, kid.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.092
Not anymore.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.052
Now all my best stuff

21:44.136 --> 21:46.221
is said and done.

21:46.304 --> 21:47.097
I'm a has-been.

21:47.180 --> 21:47.889
I don't think so.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.308
{\an3}When you hear
something enough,

21:50.392 --> 21:51.435
you start to believe it.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.566
GINA:
Um, I think I'm gonna go.

21:57.649 --> 22:01.445
{\an1}Gina, that was the nastiest
woman I have ever seen.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.030
Don't let her ruin your night.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.740
{\an1}It's too late.
No. Come on.

22:04.823 --> 22:05.907
We were just starting
to have fun.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.075
I want you to stay.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.744
{\an3}Yeah. I don't want
to walk home.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.788
Fine.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.582
I'm going to...

22:13.665 --> 22:15.667
go help Matt with the drinks.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.424
All right.
Welcome to Magic Night.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.134
Are you all ready to be amazed?

22:24.217 --> 22:26.470
(cheering)

22:27.512 --> 22:29.890
Then allow me to present
Dr. Van Fertle,

22:29.973 --> 22:32.434
Master of Illusion.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.353
{\an1}(whistles)

22:38.315 --> 22:39.357
(laughter)

22:39.441 --> 22:41.443
Okay, there was supposed
to be a lot of smoke and...

22:41.526 --> 22:47.240
Anyway, I'm Vincent Van Fertle,
doctor of prestidigitation.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.284
(laughter)

22:49.367 --> 22:51.119
Okay.
(clears throat)

22:51.203 --> 22:52.746
As...

22:56.249 --> 22:57.542
(clattering, horn honking)

22:58.668 --> 22:59.795
{\an3}(laughing)

22:59.878 --> 23:02.839
For my first trick,
um, the amazing...

23:02.923 --> 23:05.300
disappearing flowers!

23:06.551 --> 23:08.595
Uh, there should have
been a bottom of this...

23:08.678 --> 23:10.055
Oh, poor guy.

23:11.556 --> 23:15.602
Hey, I'm gonna need a volunteer.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.188
{\an3}Uh, young lady would...
would you please help me?

23:18.271 --> 23:20.190
Hmm... No.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.316
Please.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.860
{\an4}(applause)
WOMANl
All right!

23:23.944 --> 23:26.655
(Dylan whistling)

23:26.738 --> 23:28.740
{\an5}WOMAN: Yeah!
VAN FERTLE:
All right.

23:28.824 --> 23:32.244
I'm now going to show you
the power of suggestion.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.495
I'm going to hypnotize you.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.039
{\an3}But, uh, don't worry,
I won't make you

23:36.123 --> 23:39.709
{\an3}do anything embarrassing.
Well, not too embarrassing.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.836
{\an1}WOMAN:
Yeah, right.

23:40.919 --> 23:45.173
Okay, um, let's start with
some really deep breaths.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.217
(both breathing deeply)

23:47.300 --> 23:49.010
{\an3}Okay, now...
(clears throat)

23:49.094 --> 23:51.179
{\an5}VAN FERTLE:
Watch the watch.
I'm going to count

23:51.263 --> 23:53.515
backwards from ten.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.518
{\an3}As I do, you will become
more and more relaxed.

23:56.601 --> 24:00.355
{\an3}You will hear nothing but
the sound of my voice.

24:00.438 --> 24:03.442
Hey, I'm here to help.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.193
You know, there's nothing wrong
with a job like house-sitting.

24:05.277 --> 24:09.030
{\an1}Not unless you used to train
alongside the homeowner.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.575
{\an1}I used to be ranked
above Oksana.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.035
Now I'm fluffing her towels.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.706
{\an3}Life isn't a
competition, Gina.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.874
You know, you shouldn't...

24:18.957 --> 24:21.042
{\an3}You shouldn't focus
on other people.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.295
Yeah?

24:23.378 --> 24:24.880
{\an1}Why do I always feel
like I'm losing, then?

24:24.963 --> 24:26.715
{\an3}DR. VAN FERTLE:
What is your name?

24:26.798 --> 24:28.049
Kelly Taylor.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.426
{\an3}Oh, God.
(laughing)

24:29.509 --> 24:32.220
Let's get to the table.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.056
Kelly Taylor, uh, may I ask
you to cluck like a chicken?

24:35.140 --> 24:38.059
(clucking)

24:38.143 --> 24:40.562
(laughter)

24:40.645 --> 24:42.564
Okay, chickie.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.608
{\an3}I'm going to ask you
a few questions,

24:44.691 --> 24:48.028
and you will not
be able to lie.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.071
{\an3}Have you ever lied
on your taxes?

24:50.155 --> 24:51.781
No.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.117
{\an3}I said you have
to tell the truth.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.203
{\an3}Uh, you're a very
beautiful woman, Kelly,

24:56.286 --> 24:58.622
and I bet you have
a lot of suitors.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.373
If you had to be stuck

25:00.457 --> 25:04.753
on a desert island
with one of them,

25:04.836 --> 25:07.088
who would that be?

25:07.172 --> 25:08.757
Dylan McKay.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.592
{\an3}Well, he's a
very lucky man.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.635
Uh, I'm now going to count

25:11.718 --> 25:12.928
{\an3}backwards from five,
and when I do,

25:13.011 --> 25:16.139
{\an3}you will awake and
you will be refreshed

25:16.223 --> 25:18.600
{\an3}and happy and you
will remember nothing.

25:18.683 --> 25:24.105
{\an3}Five, four,
three, two, one.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.274
{\an3}(snaps fingers)
Uh...

25:26.358 --> 25:27.943
Intermission.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.528
(applause)

25:36.368 --> 25:37.577
Oh, thanks for the martini.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.828
{\an1}Yeah.

25:39.871 --> 25:40.956
KELLY:
What's wrong?

25:41.039 --> 25:44.501
What did he make me do?

25:44.584 --> 25:45.627
Nothing.
Just tell the truth.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.942
{\an3}Matt, let... Just
let me explain, okay?

26:09.025 --> 26:10.777
{\an1}You just got up on stage
and said you'd want

26:10.860 --> 26:11.820
{\an1}to be trapped
on a desert island with Dylan.

26:11.903 --> 26:12.988
What is there to explain?

26:13.071 --> 26:15.991
He was the last person I saw
on my way up to the stage.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.826
I mean, come on.
You can't take this seriously.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.995
I guess tonight, I feel
like being a serious guy.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.003
Gina, Gina, Gina!

26:28.086 --> 26:29.045
What? Five minutes ago,

26:29.129 --> 26:30.505
Kelly was my new best friend.

26:30.588 --> 26:32.340
{\an3}Fake bitch.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.009
Just cool it, all right?

26:34.092 --> 26:35.802
Listen, Gina, I wanted to...

26:36.594 --> 26:38.471
{\an1}WOMAN:
Hey, what's going on?

26:39.889 --> 26:41.182
You all right?

26:41.266 --> 26:45.061
Yeah. I'm fine.

{\an1}Peter's going to go
on the <i> Charlie Rose Show,</i>

27:05.957 --> 27:07.334
{\an1}and she invited us
to tag along.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.210
{\an3}Yeah, well, when he's
the center square,

27:09.294 --> 27:10.712
{\an3}that's when I'll
be impressed.

27:10.795 --> 27:11.755
{\an3}Till then, if he
keeps this up,

27:11.838 --> 27:14.007
{\an3}he's going to have an ulcer
by the time he's 12.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.884
You don't know that.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.427
{\an3}I know his childhood
is being stolen.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.678
I don't like that.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.430
This is boring.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.848
I want to go to Burger World.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.099
They have a playland.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.602
Peter, what's gotten into you?

27:25.685 --> 27:27.854
Burger World. Burger World!

27:27.937 --> 27:32.609
{\an1}Peter, what's
the square root of 647?

27:32.692 --> 27:34.611
What's a square root?

27:36.654 --> 27:38.365
Oh my God, the hypnotist.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.575
{\an1}He told Peter that
he was just a dumb kid.

27:40.658 --> 27:41.910
{\an3}So?

27:41.993 --> 27:45.038
{\an1}So, now he's acting like
a normal 11-year-old!

27:45.121 --> 27:46.623
We broke him.

27:46.706 --> 27:49.834
{\an3}Oh, no. Do you know
what that means?

27:49.918 --> 27:50.752
{\an3}(chanting):
Burger World.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.754
Burger World!

27:52.837 --> 27:54.964
PETER AND STEVE:
Burger World! Burger World!

27:55.048 --> 27:56.758
Burger World! Burger World!

27:56.841 --> 27:58.927
{\an3}Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!

28:07.394 --> 28:10.063
That's just perfect.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.898
(grunting)

28:14.526 --> 28:15.777
Okay.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.278
Are you okay?

28:17.362 --> 28:20.448
Uh... yeah.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.076
I just must have
picked up a nail.

28:23.159 --> 28:25.829
{\an3}It's just a flat tire.
I mean, I could handle it.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.956
That's okay, really.
I'm just gonna...

28:28.039 --> 28:29.749
I'll tell you what.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.292
I'm supposed to meet a friend
at Lola's in a couple minutes.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.920
{\an3}Why don't I fix your car,
you can give me a lift,

28:34.003 --> 28:36.339
and, uh, we can have a drink

28:36.423 --> 28:37.799
{\an3}toasting the kindness
of strangers?

28:37.882 --> 28:39.134
What do you say?

28:39.217 --> 28:40.844
Look, I'm sorry.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.554
It's, it's not that
I don't appreciate this,

28:42.637 --> 28:44.013
'cause I...

28:44.097 --> 28:45.974
I really actually do.
It's just that my...

28:47.016 --> 28:48.309
Get in the car!

28:48.393 --> 28:49.811
(screams)

28:49.894 --> 28:50.562
{\an3}(kicks)
(groans)

28:51.563 --> 28:52.814
(screaming)

28:55.567 --> 28:57.527
{\an1}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?

28:57.610 --> 28:59.028
{\an1}Someone just attacked me
with a knife.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.113
{\an1}What?
Right over there.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.364
Call the police.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.740
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.825
He was right over
there by the car!

29:03.908 --> 29:04.951
{\an1}Wait a second. Slow down.
What happened?

29:05.034 --> 29:06.995
Someone just attacked me.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.121
There's nobody down here!

29:08.204 --> 29:09.289
{\an1}He was right over
by the car.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.331
Maybe he jumped the wall.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.000
{\an3}GINA:
I don't know.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.961
Maybe he's a magician, too.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.671
The parking lot's empty.

29:16.754 --> 29:17.714
I don't understand.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.841
I do. When your boyfriend
didn't chase after you,

29:19.924 --> 29:21.801
you counted to ten
and started screaming.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.012
Are you calling me a liar?

29:24.095 --> 29:25.972
{\an3}Wouldn't be the first time
tonight, Gina.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.849
{\an3}You know, I was going
to wait for my cab

29:27.932 --> 29:31.019
out here, but on
second thought...

29:33.605 --> 29:36.024
I...

29:43.448 --> 29:45.450
You guys got to check
this place out.

29:47.785 --> 29:49.370
Oh, get out of here.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.830
I've always wanted
to try one of these things.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.707
{\an3}All right.
(knocking)

29:52.790 --> 29:55.251
{\an3}20 bucks says you cannot
make yourself disappear, man.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.920
Twenty?

29:57.003 --> 29:59.088
Easy money.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.216
Okay.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.593
Make sure it
stays secure.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.678
{\an3}You got it?
Yep.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.388
(rattling)

30:07.472 --> 30:10.016
(laughing nervously)

30:10.099 --> 30:11.768
I can't, uh...
I can't find the latch.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.269
The, uh... the song's

30:13.353 --> 30:15.730
almost over, so just unlock
the door for me, okay?

30:15.813 --> 30:17.899
No, no. Not till you cough
the cash, man. Sorry.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.859
No, it's very funny.
Come on. Open the door.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.195
Okay.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.032
(pounding on lock)

30:26.115 --> 30:27.992
{\an3}Oh, man.
"Oh, man"?

30:31.162 --> 30:33.790
{\an3}Dude, it's locked.
I can't open it.

30:33.873 --> 30:34.958
If there's dead air,
I'm screwed.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.126
We could string a mic cord.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.753
No. Sonny, you got to,
you got to cover for me.

30:38.836 --> 30:39.921
Oh, no can do, kid.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.589
Let me go find
that magician.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.924
There's no time.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.801
No one wants
to hear my voice anymore.

30:44.884 --> 30:46.594
Your listeners
will never forgive you.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.097
They'll love you, okay?
I promise.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.224
Okay. It's your pink slip.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.601
(door opens)

30:53.685 --> 30:55.687
Is he gone?
Yep.

31:00.024 --> 31:00.942
Violà!

31:01.025 --> 31:02.610
My lovely assistant Noah.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.949
SONNY (over the air):
Good evening, Beverly Hills.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.326
I'm Sonny Sharp and I'm back.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.370
Nice work, my friend.

31:12.453 --> 31:13.997
Good deal.
Mm-hmm.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.373
All right.

31:16.874 --> 31:18.668
{\an5}DONNA:
My parents
are breaking my heart.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.671
Do you think their
marriage is over?

31:21.754 --> 31:24.007
I don't know.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.634
I just don't understand

31:26.718 --> 31:31.764
how two people who have shared
so much suddenly can't connect.

31:31.848 --> 31:35.977
{\an3}I've seen it happen
more than once.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.980
{\an1}Nothing makes sense
to me anymore.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.065
I'll second that.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.612
{\an1}So, what really
happened last night?

31:45.695 --> 31:48.156
{\an3}I told you,
the magician was horrible,

31:48.239 --> 31:49.407
and it was just like...

31:49.490 --> 31:53.661
And were you really hypnotized?
This is me you're talking to.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.456
Yes. I mean, I think so.

31:56.539 --> 31:59.000
{\an3}I don't remember
choosing Dylan over Matt,

31:59.083 --> 32:00.835
{\an3}and I have no idea
why I would do that.

32:00.918 --> 32:04.172
{\an1}Well, maybe because
that's how you really feel.

32:11.929 --> 32:15.183
(club striking ball)

32:15.266 --> 32:18.019
{\an1}Not bad.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.729
Mind if I join in?

32:21.272 --> 32:22.982
{\an3}I didn't know
you were a golfer.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.068
From time to time.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.946
Donna send you?

32:30.448 --> 32:31.532
{\an1}NOAH:
No.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.827
I came on my own.

32:34.911 --> 32:35.870
{\an1}That's nice.
That's very nice.

32:35.953 --> 32:37.205
{\an3}Thank you.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.502
Look, Dr. Martin...

32:45.922 --> 32:47.924
Yeah?

32:49.092 --> 32:52.303
{\an1}Um, I was just
wondering if, um...

32:53.429 --> 32:55.890
{\an3}Noah, is there something
I can help you with?

32:55.973 --> 32:57.433
I was just wondering

32:57.517 --> 33:00.019
why you're throwing
your whole life away.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.480
{\an1}I mean, I watched
my own dad do the same thing.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.023
I'm still trying
to figure out why.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.401
Next to those two trees,

33:06.484 --> 33:08.361
{\an3}you can just make out
the eighth hole.

33:08.444 --> 33:11.322
{\an3}Right there,
two months ago,

33:11.406 --> 33:15.034
{\an3}my friend Hugh Shapelle
just keeled over.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.621
Heart attack.
52 years old.

33:18.705 --> 33:19.747
Heart attack.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.084
{\an3}He was dead before his knees
even hit... hit the green.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.294
{\an3}I'm sorry.
And you add to that

33:25.378 --> 33:28.297
the stroke I had
a couple years ago,

33:28.381 --> 33:31.884
and I started to think about all
the things that I planned to do

33:31.968 --> 33:33.636
when I retired,

33:33.720 --> 33:35.805
but never did.

33:35.888 --> 33:38.558
A separation somehow
is gonna fix all that?

33:38.641 --> 33:39.600
I asked Felice

33:39.684 --> 33:43.479
to climb Mount Kilimanjaro
with me.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.940
She said that
her collapsed arches

33:46.023 --> 33:47.942
really wouldn't be able
to handle it.

33:48.025 --> 33:51.446
{\an3}So I suggested maybe we should
take some skydiving lessons.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.073
All she could talk about
was motion sickness.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.491
If you try explain it to her...

33:55.575 --> 33:56.951
How can I do that?

33:57.034 --> 33:59.954
It's not her fault.
I've changed.

34:00.037 --> 34:01.456
{\an3}She hasn't.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.792
I can't expect her to be
a new person overnight.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.795
{\an3}I mean, you haven't
even asked her.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.300
{\an1}Well, Felice doesn't
really bend very well.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.969
How can she

34:15.052 --> 34:17.221
when she doesn't even know
what you're going through?

34:28.065 --> 34:30.150
(knocking)

34:35.239 --> 34:38.326
{\an1}I just read in the paper
that they caught a guy

34:38.409 --> 34:40.828
who has been forcing women
into their cars at knifepoint.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.039
He raped four women
in the last two weeks.

34:45.081 --> 34:46.958
I almost lost you.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.043
You did.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.232
{\an1}I just got off the phone
with Dr. Van Fertle.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.858
He said he's gonna meet us

35:10.942 --> 35:11.859
{\an1}in half an hour
to reverse the hypnosis.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.320
Okay, just give me five
more minutes with him.

35:17.448 --> 35:21.035
{\an3}Mrs. Foley thinks that we're
at the Van Gogh exhibit.

35:21.118 --> 35:23.996
And if we take care of this now,
she'll never know what happened.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.289
I'm making inroads here.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.791
{\an3}Inroads?

35:26.874 --> 35:30.878
Steve, this kid could
find a cure to cancer

35:30.962 --> 35:32.338
{\an3}or write the next
great symphony.

35:32.421 --> 35:34.799
Those are all things he can
do when he's older, Janet.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.717
{\an3}Yeah, but not if
you keep meddling.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.095
I mean, at this rate,
his IQ is diminishing

35:39.178 --> 35:40.721
{\an3}faster than a
Brazilian rainforest.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.223
Why's it so important to you?

35:42.306 --> 35:44.600
Because I used to be like Peter.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.602
Well, not quite as smart,

35:46.686 --> 35:49.522
but I had really big plans
for myself,

35:49.605 --> 35:52.108
and somehow,
I just got sidetracked.

35:53.150 --> 35:55.278
He shouldn't have any regrets.

35:55.361 --> 35:57.238
And neither should you.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.366
Hey, you're the editor
of a very successful newspaper.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.159
You're a great person.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.245
You're the best girlfriend
a guy could have.

36:04.328 --> 36:07.582
Janet, one thing I know
for sure, at the end of the day,

36:07.665 --> 36:09.083
happiness matters.

36:09.166 --> 36:10.793
And Peter needs to learn that.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.133
He's terrible.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.260
Yeah, but he won you
a pair of wax lips.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.638
{\an1}Aw...
Well, I picked them out.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.932
You know, if you divide
the density of the ball

36:25.016 --> 36:26.309
{\an3}by the circumference
of your windup,

36:26.392 --> 36:28.769
{\an3}I think you can
maximize your score.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.104
What'd you say?

36:30.187 --> 36:33.816
Uh, I mean...

36:33.900 --> 36:36.319
can I have a corn dog?

36:41.157 --> 36:44.535
{\an1}Hey, did you know this thing
has one-touch dialing?

36:44.619 --> 36:47.496
It's a triple fudge brownie.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.416
Kind of a pastry
peace offering.

36:50.499 --> 36:52.084
Hmm.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.127
{\an3}Look, Matt,

36:53.210 --> 36:55.504
I'm sorry about last night.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.298
So you said.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.467
{\an3}Some feedback would
be nice here.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.178
What do you want me to do,
Kelly?

37:02.261 --> 37:03.971
You want me, you want me
to throw a fit?

37:04.055 --> 37:06.098
You want me to ask you to leave?
You want me to punch something?

37:06.182 --> 37:07.183
I'm not going to.

37:07.266 --> 37:10.144
Anybody else would get upset.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.313
Well, you're not dating
anyone else, you're dating me.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.942
Look, we're not married.

37:16.025 --> 37:16.984
I don't own you.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.486
If you want to go, then go.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.404
I'll be fine.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.157
The only claim I have on you
is that I love you.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.076
I love you, too.

37:25.159 --> 37:26.160
I know that.

37:26.243 --> 37:29.372
So what do we do now?

37:29.455 --> 37:32.667
I may need a little time.

37:32.750 --> 37:36.379
Time. Okay.

37:38.255 --> 37:40.174
{\an1}Okay...

37:40.257 --> 37:42.176
time's up.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.863
{\an3}Let's go, the movie is
gonna start in 15 minutes.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.073
Maybe it'll be a comedy.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.616
{\an3}Yeah.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.330
Mom, you okay?

38:13.249 --> 38:15.543
Everything just...

38:15.626 --> 38:19.213
just seems
so out of control.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.214
(sobbing)

38:20.297 --> 38:21.882
I wake up every morning,
thinking

38:21.966 --> 38:24.343
this just can't be happening,
but it is.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.595
Come on.
And then I think

38:26.679 --> 38:28.055
maybe you're right,
but what did I say?

38:28.139 --> 38:31.726
{\an1}What did I do?
Nothing.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.812
You're not responsible
for my unhappiness.

38:41.610 --> 38:42.903
I needed to talk.

38:42.987 --> 38:46.365
{\an1}I should've made it easier
for you to listen.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.701
So why now?

38:50.494 --> 38:53.247
Because someone
made me realize

38:53.330 --> 38:55.958
how really important it is

38:56.042 --> 38:58.252
to make this work.

38:58.335 --> 39:01.130
{\an1}We need help.
And I called Father Ledley.

39:01.213 --> 39:05.634
{\an1}And we're his first
appointment next week.

39:05.718 --> 39:09.889
So, you think we can
give this a try?

39:09.972 --> 39:12.391
Okay.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.784
Hi.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.994
Well, I know you're not here
to help me with this.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.121
Lose the attitude, Gina.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.164
Spit it out, Kelly.

39:35.247 --> 39:38.584
Look, I'm here
to apologize, okay?

39:38.667 --> 39:41.504
For last night,
for the... hypnotist,

39:41.587 --> 39:43.339
for not believing
you were attacked.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.174
For not being able
to shake my boyfriend?

39:45.257 --> 39:47.468
Never mind.

39:47.551 --> 39:50.096
Well, at least you're honest.

39:51.388 --> 39:55.601
No one else in this town
seems to have that trait.

39:55.684 --> 39:57.853
Especially the guys.

39:59.522 --> 40:03.359
This was supposed to be mine.

40:03.442 --> 40:07.196
The car, the glamorous life,
all of it.

40:07.279 --> 40:10.991
Life takes unexpected turns.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.034
Yeah, I know.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.662
You're never gonna be happy
until you let it go.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.206
Can you do that?

40:17.289 --> 40:20.126
Can you promise me
you'll let Dylan go?

40:23.129 --> 40:25.965
I promise.

40:34.431 --> 40:35.808
(car door closes)

40:35.891 --> 40:37.434
(car engine starts)

40:39.562 --> 40:42.565
Peter, were you or were you
not hypnotized?

40:42.648 --> 40:44.024
Well, a conflux of sunspots

40:44.108 --> 40:45.860
and the current orbit
of Neptune may have...

40:45.943 --> 40:47.611
Peter.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.405
I was faking.

40:50.948 --> 40:54.326
{\an1}Hey. it's okay.
You can tell her.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.206
{\an1}Because I don't want
to go to college.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.000
Not yet, at least.

41:01.083 --> 41:04.295
Well, honey, why didn't you
just say so in the first place?

41:04.378 --> 41:07.423
{\an5}PETER:
I didn't want
to disappoint you.

41:07.506 --> 41:09.884
And then when I saw ho much fun

41:09.967 --> 41:11.343
Steve has every day...

41:11.427 --> 41:13.220
I do have fun.
Fun is key.

41:14.430 --> 41:19.685
Well, then college
will have to wait.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.063
Yeah but Magic Mountain can't.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.066
{\an1}Did you know that the
probability of being killed

41:26.150 --> 41:29.945
on a rollercoaster
is one in 70 million?

41:30.029 --> 41:32.114
{\an1}No, I didn't know that.
(laughter)

41:33.824 --> 41:37.077
As promised.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.746
{\an1}You know, you didn't
have to do this.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.247
{\an3}You gave me a chance
to do what I love,

41:40.331 --> 41:41.874
and I'm grateful.

41:41.957 --> 41:44.210
{\an3}It was brief, but thanks.
(knocking)

41:45.836 --> 41:48.130
Rick, uh...

41:48.214 --> 41:49.798
(nervous chuckle)

41:49.882 --> 41:51.258
About last night...

41:51.342 --> 41:52.801
{\an3}The station was
flooded with calls.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.595
It was an emergency.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.764
{\an3}And everyone wanted to know
how we got you back.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.475
{\an3}So guess what,
you're back.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.810
I believe the last time
we chatted,

42:01.894 --> 42:03.270
I was late for a bingo game.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.564
{\an3}Oh, it's, it's radio.
It's all forgiven.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.566
{\an3}Now, look, I've talked
to the higher-ups.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.276
We want to broaden
our audience base,

42:09.360 --> 42:10.611
you know, nab some of
the older listeners.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.780
{\an3}You'll fit right into
our lunchtime slot.

42:12.863 --> 42:14.156
So?

42:14.240 --> 42:16.951
So sign me up.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.203
Make sure the kid
gets a finder's fee.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.288
Thanks.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.998
Thanks, man.

42:26.877 --> 42:29.964
What do you want?

42:30.047 --> 42:32.132
Look, I'm... I'm tired
of pissed-off people.

42:32.216 --> 42:34.134
Mm, lucky for you,
I've cooled down.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.595
Really?

42:38.722 --> 42:40.099
I talked to Kelly.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.684
{\an3}(groans)

42:41.767 --> 42:45.980
{\an1}It helped, shockingly.
(sighs)

42:46.063 --> 42:46.772
So...

42:46.855 --> 42:50.234
So?

42:53.570 --> 42:57.157
Does this visit include...
an apology?

42:57.241 --> 42:58.784
Yeah.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.162
That doesn't count, Dylan.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.331
All right.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.583
I am sorry.

43:10.379 --> 43:12.047
That wasn't so bad.

43:12.131 --> 43:14.425
I'm sorry, too.
