23:52.198 --> 23:53.500
THAT'S RIGHT.

23:56.803 --> 23:57.737

WHO IS HE?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.438
HE'S MY FRIEND
AT THE SENATOR'S OFFICE.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.608
COLIN SELVIN,
ALL RIGHT.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.175
HE SAYS YOU CAN
SAVE YOURSELF
IF YOU JUST--

24:03.209 --> 24:04.477
I WON'T
BETRAY MY MEN.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.745
BUT YOU WILL GIVE UP
ALL OF THE YEARS

24:05.778 --> 24:06.813
YOU SPENT GETTING
TO WHERE YOU ARE.

24:06.846 --> 24:09.949
TOM, YOU CAN END UP
PROSECUTED WITH YOUR MEN,

24:09.982 --> 24:11.684
PERHAPS JAILED,
HUMILIATED,

24:11.718 --> 24:14.020
DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED,
CAN'T GET A JOB.

"WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS?"

24:16.489 --> 24:17.524
"OH, I CAN'T TELL YOU."

24:17.557 --> 24:18.658
YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW THAT?

24:18.691 --> 24:21.093
OR, YOU CAN COOPERATE
WITH WHOMEVER
THEY DIRECT YOU TO

24:21.127 --> 24:22.995
IN WHATEVER WAY
THEY ASK YOU TO,
UNDER THE LAW,

24:23.029 --> 24:26.132
AND THEN YOU ARE
IN A POSITION
TO HELP YOUR MEN,

24:26.165 --> 24:27.033
LEGALLY AND CORRECTLY.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.468
AND WHAT IF LEGALLY
WON'T WORK?

24:29.502 --> 24:30.469
THEN...

24:30.503 --> 24:33.540
I WON'T GIVE UP MY MEN.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.609
MY FAULT.
I DID THIS TO MYSELF.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.310
I WAS SO MAD, I JUST--

24:38.344 --> 24:39.278
STOP PROTECTING HIM.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.880
I SAID I DID THIS
TO MYSELF.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.015
YOU CUT YOURSELF?
THAT'S RIGHT.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.224
LEAVE HIM!

24:52.258 --> 24:53.292
MAYBE SHE SHOULD.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.395
BUT WHAT
DO YOU ADVISE
SHE DO AFTERWARD?

24:56.428 --> 24:57.697
LEAVE HIM NOW.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.966
AND GET AS FAR AWAY
FROM THIS PLACE

AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

SIR, 30 DAYS,
WHATEVER THE CHARGES,

SUFFICIENTLY TO ALLOW ME
TO REFUTE THEM.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.855
GIVE ME JUST 30 DAYS,
AND I WILL DO SO
TO YOUR SATISFACTION.

MY CONSIDERED BELIEF

26:02.228 --> 26:04.096
THAT YOU HAVE FAILED
IN THAT PRIMARY DUTY.

TO PREPARE, TRAIN AND FIELD.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.640

TO BENCH ME, FINE.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.774
BUT IF YOU TAKE THOSE MEN
OUT OF THE FIGHT,

26:14.807 --> 26:16.108
YOU'LL BE HANDING
A VICTORY TO OUR ENEMIES.

26:16.142 --> 26:21.113

OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE
TO THIS NATION.

AT THE STATION,

27:19.205 --> 27:21.540
I HEARD HIM

SO WHERE IS IT?

27:42.428 --> 27:43.629
