00:01.520 --> 00:04.298
Cafe Khalil, four o'clock. There's
something I have to tell you.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.880
- I was set up.
- You think it was me?

00:07.881 --> 00:10.519
- Do you expect to come back to work?
- I'm your best operative.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.919
Target is Jack Turner.

00:11.920 --> 00:16.199
Mr Turner is currently bidding to
acquire the Upper Khyber Dam.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.359
Eddie!

00:17.360 --> 00:19.759
Hey! Dad!

00:19.760 --> 00:21.879
Dad, this is Alex Kent, she saved Eddie.

00:21.880 --> 00:22.920
Something's going on.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.000
Hello, Eddie.
Have you come to stay for a bit?

00:26.001 --> 00:29.039
You're somewhere that you don't
belong. You're dead.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.039
Keel says there's a mole on the team.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.998
Someone betrayed me.
Someone on the team.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.240
Removal is authorised.

00:34.241 --> 00:36.959
Kill me and you will never find out
who wants you dead.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.200
What are you talking about?

00:44.640 --> 00:47.840
This programme contains some violent
scenes and some scenes of a sexual nature.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.719
We're going to be late.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.519
Calm down, Lars.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.760
We've got plenty of time.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.520
Great.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.639
Just great.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.839
Help me!

02:12.840 --> 02:15.200
Help me, please!
He's going to kill me! Please!

02:16.680 --> 02:18.440
Please,
look he's coming, he's got a knife.

02:18.441 --> 02:19.799
Please help me, please!

02:19.800 --> 02:22.559
- Police, we get the police...
- There's no time!

02:22.560 --> 02:26.479
Please, please just open the door.
He's going to kill me!

02:26.480 --> 02:27.840
Thank you.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.680
Oh, my God. Go drive, drive!

02:32.720 --> 02:33.840
(TYRES SCREECH)

02:39.720 --> 02:41.520
- You hurt?
- Pull over.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.759
I said, pull over. Lars!
Count of three, Lars.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.199
He sent you, didn't he?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.680
- One... Two..!
- Jack Turner!

02:48.681 --> 02:50.280
For God's sake, put that down!

02:51.520 --> 02:53.479
No!

02:53.480 --> 02:54.600
I said, pull over!

02:56.160 --> 02:57.360
Lars!

03:37.920 --> 03:40.080
You wasn't supposed to
crash it, you wanker.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.079
No.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.719
Eddie?
Get away from me.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.719
No!

04:04.720 --> 04:06.880
Eddie?
(EDDIE GASPS)

04:11.120 --> 04:12.440
What is it, Eddie?

04:17.640 --> 04:19.399
I might be able to help if you tell me.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.639
I keep seeing his face.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.199
Who?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.160
That man.
The one who tried to take me.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.399
It was scary, wasn't it?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.240
He looked so angry.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.519
You don't need to be afraid.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.799
That man won't ever bother you again.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.319
How do you know?

04:44.320 --> 04:46.040
I just do.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.479
No hurry.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.840
Sam's not here yet.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.719
Miss Morgan, what are you doing
sitting all alone in the dark?

05:29.720 --> 05:32.519
Hoping for a word with you, actually.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.399
Sounds serious.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.519
Keel says we have a mole.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.640
So I gather.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.599
Thoughts?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.640
Present company excepted?

05:44.920 --> 05:47.320
Well, Fowkes is new to the team.
No-one really knows him.

05:47.321 --> 05:48.959
I know he's loud, rude

05:48.960 --> 05:51.759
and opinionated with no
command of the facts whatsoever.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.400
Unless it's all an act,
in which case he deserves an Oscar.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.319
Deacon?

05:57.320 --> 06:02.439
Religious, a family man with
a brilliant career at Byzantium.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.439
Not the likeliest suspect either.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.879
Which just leaves Sam.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.399
I'd never have suspected her.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.480
But she still won't talk about why
she disappeared.

06:09.481 --> 06:11.599
Keel could be wrong.
Maybe there isn't a mole.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.159
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.759
- But?
- Hasan.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.640
He was too careful to
get pinched like that.

06:18.641 --> 06:20.440
Someone had to have set him up.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.639
- You looking for someone?
- I'm just going for a run.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.719
Eddie finally settle down?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.000
He's still pretty upset.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.879
Thanks for coming tomorrow.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.280
It's important I keep him close right now.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.919
You're late.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.519
Yeah, well, Edward's been having
nightmares about Hasan.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.879
That's unfortunate,

07:11.880 --> 07:14.318
but that boy's distress got you
invited into the house.

07:14.319 --> 07:16.000
And to the conference this weekend.

07:16.001 --> 07:19.599
Which is what we're here to discuss.
Sam - report, please.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.679
Jack's been working round the clock.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.959
Those men that I saw when I first
went to the house, one of them

07:24.960 --> 07:27.919
had a meeting privately with Jack
about half a dozen times this week.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.639
Yeah, we've seen him coming
and going. That's Patrik Lindberg.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.119
He's the head of KPEK.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.759
He's second in command to
the chairman Lars Holm.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.959
KPEK is the Norwegian firm that will
operate the dam if Turner wins.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.159
Their support is vital. Without
KPEK's signature the Turners cannot

07:41.160 --> 07:42.999
submit their financial bid.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.800
They had a big row two days ago.

07:47.130 --> 07:47.769
About?

07:47.894 --> 07:49.774
Lindberg was saying
he couldn't sign the deal,

07:49.775 --> 07:51.320
not without his chairman's approval.

07:51.321 --> 07:52.759
And the financial bid?

07:52.760 --> 07:55.439
They've been putting it
together on Jack's laptop.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.878
It's complicated. It
must run thousands of pages.

07:57.879 --> 07:59.240
All we need is the total.

07:59.241 --> 08:01.600
What's Turner prepared to pay for the dam?

08:03.461 --> 08:05.120
When he's not at the laptop,

08:05.121 --> 08:07.611
Jack stores the data on a memory
stick in his pocket.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.999
I'm going to need a duplicate.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.239
Corrupted,
so it appears the data's been lost.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.840
I'll swap it out with the original.

08:15.841 --> 08:17.079
OK.

08:17.080 --> 08:21.519
You're aware we have 32 hours only
in which to acquire the bid?

08:21.520 --> 08:23.360
I'm aware.
Zoe.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.879
OK. There are four bidders
including the Turners.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.279
Ceuxron, Chinese Industries Group,
Prohurst and JTRP.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.240
The Chinese are considered the favourites.

08:33.241 --> 08:34.958
The meetings with the bidders

08:34.960 --> 08:37.039
and their technical partners
take place tomorrow.

08:37.041 --> 08:39.719
The tenders will be unsealed at
08:00 hours this Saturday.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.198
The highest bidder wins.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.239
Byzantium has acquired all the other bids.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.879
But we need the Turner bid to
ensure our client prevails.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.920
So our client must be
one of the other bidders.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.478
But you're not going to tell us which one.

08:54.479 --> 08:56.080
You know what you need to do your job.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.519
Anything else, Sam?

08:59.520 --> 09:01.280
Nope.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.760
Nothing like team spirit, eh?

09:53.080 --> 09:55.120
The killed her to get to you, didn't they?

10:01.400 --> 10:02.640
I said, "Who do you work for?"

10:28.720 --> 10:30.200
This is the story of the Snow Maiden.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.520
Where is it you're from again, Miss Kent?

11:01.521 --> 11:04.479
I'm sorry?
Bloomington, is it? Indiana?

11:04.480 --> 11:05.598
Yeah, that's right.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.040
I guess school teachers
from Bloomington, Indiana,

11:08.041 --> 11:10.719
don't get to stay in luxury
hotels very often.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.359
No. I guess we don't.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.080
Well done, then.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.519
I'm here to help Edward.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.520
Course you are.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.599
Doesn't keep you from helping
yourself, though, does it?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.720
Alex? Eddie, come on.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.359
And they're off.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.719
Sam spends the weekend in a bloody
five-star hotel,

11:36.720 --> 11:40.279
while we're locked up in this shit
hole, staring at an empty house.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.439
We've got a problem.
What's that?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.878
You now that tracking device
I planted on that case that

11:44.879 --> 11:46.120
Turner gave Dave Ryder?

11:46.121 --> 11:48.759
Yeah, I've lost the signal.
Do you think Ryder found it?

11:48.760 --> 11:51.799
I don't know. It could just be a bad
transponder. You planted it wrong.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.520
I know how to plant a tracking device.

11:53.521 --> 11:56.439
After all the trouble I went to,
getting banged up on that bike...

11:56.440 --> 11:57.960
I planted it correctly.
Sure you did.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.560
Right... there?

12:38.115 --> 12:38.984
Mr. Turner.

12:39.314 --> 12:40.799
- Thank you.
- No problem.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.079
- Just on the second floor.
- Great. OK.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.520
Mr Bingham.
Do you have everything ready for us?

12:49.040 --> 12:52.159
See that, Eddie? Putting on
fireworks especially for you.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.919
Grandad had a word with the manager,
didn't he, Stevie?

12:54.920 --> 12:57.119
I don't believe you.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.879
People always do what Grandad tells them.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.719
Didn't have fireworks when I was your age.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.480
Caught a blaze once - huge.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.439
Flames as tall as trees.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.599
- A bonfire?
- No, a paint factory down the road.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.439
I knew the boys who started it.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.119
One of them was still inside.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.319
Eddie doesn't need to hear
this story, Dad.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.280
Thank you.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.800
OK.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.279
If you could scan your thumb, Mr Bingham.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.160
Your laptop will go right in there.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.439
Eddie! Come on,
you shouldn't be doing that here.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.960
It's OK, I've got it.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.600
Sorry.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.600
This must be yours.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.599
What do you say?

14:19.600 --> 14:20.640
Thank you.

14:22.440 --> 14:23.600
Everything OK here?

14:25.040 --> 14:26.160
Yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.480
(PHONE BEEPS)

15:08.920 --> 15:10.719
I have to go.

15:10.720 --> 15:11.960
What's the matter?

15:11.961 --> 15:13.479
It's nothing.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.519
You've been on edge lately.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.519
I think you know why.

15:18.073 --> 15:21.119
- How did Keel find out?
- That's a question for you to answer.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.359
I'm the only one who knows it's you,
Aidan.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.960
I promise you that.
No-one in MI6 has your name.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.439
Once Keel has the scent,

15:28.440 --> 15:31.120
he won't lose it
until he finds out who the mole is.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.719
- You think you're being watched?
- I know I am.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.880
You want to stop seeing each other,
is that it?

15:38.760 --> 15:41.120
Listen.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.200
We have to.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.679
Are you sure Keel's the reason?

15:48.680 --> 15:52.240
Of course.
What other reason would there be?

15:57.727 --> 15:58.335
Alex?

15:58.680 --> 16:00.600
Dad said you can take me to the fireworks.

16:00.601 --> 16:03.159
Ah, yeah, Dad did say that.
But as you're missing school,

16:03.160 --> 16:05.000
I expect you to get some work done today.

16:05.001 --> 16:07.959
The meeting will take a few hours.
I'll be back in time for dinner.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.959
Have fun, you two.
Sounds like Dad's got a good plan.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.600
What will it be then, history or math?

16:12.601 --> 16:14.720
Maths.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.599
- Where's Lindberg?
- He'll be along.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.999
It's not good going in there
without our technical partner.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.519
Look, I'll bring him
in as soon as he gets here.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.600
Well, you go on.
Don't keep the Pakistanis waiting.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.600
See if you can finish these two
pages, then I'll come back

16:43.601 --> 16:44.920
and check your answers, OK?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.720
OK.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.640
Oui.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.720
If you're going to kill me,
just get it over with.

17:59.920 --> 18:04.879
I won't kill you - not
when you can still be helpful to me.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.440
How could I be helpful to you?

18:11.040 --> 18:12.720
You're spying on the Turners.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.839
I want their bid.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.320
You're not listed as a bidder.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.600
After the damage you did to me last year,

18:21.601 --> 18:24.160
I thought it wise to
keep my name out of it.

18:27.480 --> 18:31.360
I don't... I... I don't have their bid.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.719
You're going to have an envelope
delivered to me

18:36.720 --> 18:39.120
by eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.400
The Turner bid will be inside it.

18:46.360 --> 18:47.960
Now get out of my sight.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.519
You're late, Patrik.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.799
I can't reach Lars.
What, and that's bad news?

19:01.800 --> 19:04.599
He's the chairman of the board, Mr Turner.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.039
I can't sign the documents,
not without his approval.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.319
Here's what you're going to do -
you and me,

19:10.320 --> 19:12.280
we're going to walk through that door.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.159
You're going to smile, you're going
to tell Mr Soomro how pleased

19:17.160 --> 19:20.152
KPEK is to be in business
with Jack Turner.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.760
And then you're going to
sign on the dotted line.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.639
You want me to act like everything
is fine, when I know it's not?

19:30.640 --> 19:31.720
Look at it this way...

19:32.880 --> 19:34.520
..what choice do you have?

19:44.480 --> 19:46.560
(MANGLED AUDIO)

20:03.240 --> 20:06.640
Deacon? How many times you
going to watch that?

20:08.720 --> 20:12.119
Someone called Turner twenty
minutes before Hasan got grabbed.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.880
You think the caller told them
how to find him?

20:16.160 --> 20:17.400
They must have.

20:17.401 --> 20:19.400
If I could just make out what
they were saying.

20:19.401 --> 20:22.039
It still wouldn't tell you who the
mole is. You know that.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.720
It would get me one step closer.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.202
I don't like casualties on my watch.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.040
You don't seriously think it was Aidan?

20:35.440 --> 20:37.359
What makes you think that?

20:37.360 --> 20:40.160
Just the way you were
looking at him before.

20:42.107 --> 20:42.850
Hello.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.320
- What?
- They're chucking something out.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.159
Well, it's not the recycling, is it?

20:55.160 --> 20:57.200
- What, then?
- Hasan.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.599
Surprised it took them this long.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.040
Where were they taking him?

21:02.041 --> 21:04.440
They'll probably dump him somewhere.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.758
Bollocks to that.
What are you gobbing on about now?

21:07.759 --> 21:08.880
A man's dignity.

21:08.881 --> 21:12.080
Or did we sign that
away in our contracts too?

21:14.880 --> 21:16.159
Go.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.159
What? You're not serious?

21:18.160 --> 21:21.240
See where they dump him. Could be
useful information.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.200
You coming?

21:31.320 --> 21:32.360
I'm driving.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.200
- Anything?
- Nothing. Thank you.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.920
All his movements are consistent
with the reports

21:54.921 --> 21:56.319
he's been giving you.

21:56.320 --> 22:00.159
If he is hiding something,
he's extremely good at it.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.639
What about that?

22:01.640 --> 22:03.000
Right there.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.319
He's just moving out of CCTV range.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.919
How often does he do that?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.119
All the time.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.078
There might be 10,000 cameras
in this city,

22:11.079 --> 22:12.998
but that still leaves
plenty of dead ground.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.918
I'm interested in his longest absences.

22:14.919 --> 22:16.760
- Aside from building interiors?
- Right.

22:20.240 --> 22:23.399
Here. Suicide Bridge, two weeks ago.

22:23.400 --> 22:26.279
Comes in here at 14:22:37

22:26.280 --> 22:30.639
and goes out the other side
at 14:28:54.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.399
Six minutes 17 seconds.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.599
Long time to spend
walking across a bridge, isn't it?

22:36.600 --> 22:37.639
Hmm.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.239
Unless he was thinking of jumping.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.520
He always runs late.
It's kind of a thing with him.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.920
Run back ten minutes.
See who else shows up.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.359
Stop!

22:52.360 --> 22:54.080
Go forward.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.880
Who is she?

23:01.160 --> 23:02.160
A ghost.

23:19.880 --> 23:22.399
- Would you like a hot chocolate?
- Yes, please.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.440
- You stay where I can see you, Ok?
- Ok.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.240
Hot chocolate, please. Thank you.

23:36.360 --> 23:39.039
Good work. What's the problem?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.519
I got a lovely surprise upstairs.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.040
Bernard Faroux.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.520
Did he see you?

23:47.521 --> 23:50.319
Oh, yeah. We had a lovely chat.
Caught up on old times.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.160
Then he stuck a gun between my legs.

23:52.161 --> 23:54.359
But he didn't expose you.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.800
He's a stealth partner in another
company. He wants the Turners' bid.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.279
We need to get you out.
I'm going nowhere.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.239
You think he ordered the hit in Tangier?

24:05.240 --> 24:06.799
It's a possibility.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.719
And all this time you were convinced
it was me that was responsible.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.400
I said it was a possibility.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.799
You on your own, Master Turner?

24:17.800 --> 24:19.720
No.
Alex is around here somewhere.

24:19.721 --> 24:21.080
Whereabouts?

24:22.120 --> 24:25.279
Sam. This isn't the bid.
It has to be.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.679
It's some kind of personal diary.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.879
For Jack?

24:28.880 --> 24:30.999
No. For Lars Holm.
The Chairman of KPEK.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.359
What's Jack walking around with this for?

24:33.360 --> 24:34.520
And where's the bid?

24:35.600 --> 24:38.679
It must be on the laptop.
I saw Bingham take it somewhere.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.400
The hotel vault probably.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.880
Problem. I'll take care of it.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.920
- There you are.
- Oh, thank you.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.000
- Something's happened.
- Yeah.

25:25.234 --> 25:27.074
I think I've seen one of those
blokes before.

25:27.075 --> 25:27.515
Yeah? When?

25:27.600 --> 25:30.079
Dragging Hasan into the house.
Wearing a hoodie.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.840
Not this time. Smile, boys.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.120
Hey! Where do you think you're
going?

25:41.121 --> 25:43.120
See where they take him, of course.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.400
Oh, no.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.560
You're even heavier than you look, mate.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.920
Shit.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.480
- Come on.
- Ok.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.600
Stupid bugger. Where are you?

27:36.600 --> 27:39.919
Bastards chopped him up.
Burned all the bits and pieces.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.000
Bits and pieces?

27:41.001 --> 27:44.199
Yeah. They've got their own little
crematorium down there.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.760
Wasn't a total waste of time, though.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.879
Waited for them to leave.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.560
Snagged poor old Hasan's boot.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.239
Yeah.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.640
Hasan didn't wear boots.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.839
Well done, Patrik.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.480
- Thank you, Mr Soomro.
- Pleasure.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.639
- If that's all?
- For now.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.680
Thank you, Mr Lindberg. We're really
looking forward to working with you.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.880
- He seem ok to you?
- You don't you worry about him.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.319
You did well, Stevie.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.679
Well, it's not going to come down to
technical specs though, is it?

28:39.680 --> 28:42.319
- Soomro's all about the money.
- Aren't we all?

28:42.320 --> 28:45.399
Dad, we're up against three
of the biggest utility

28:45.400 --> 28:46.880
contractors in the world.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.640
The only ones we need to
worry about are the Chinese.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.640
What do you mean?

28:57.596 --> 28:58.959
You've seen the other two bids?

28:59.958 --> 29:01.959
We're higher. I've made sure of it.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.240
That's why we're leveraged to
the max on this thing?

29:04.241 --> 29:06.439
£970,000,000, Dad.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.679
Bingham tried to get the Chink bid,
as well,

29:08.680 --> 29:11.159
but they're more careful than
the Europeans.

29:11.160 --> 29:12.800
You've got to admire them for that.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.399
Come off it, Stevie.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.880
You don't think they're trying to
steal our bid as well?

29:25.320 --> 29:27.599
I was hoping I'd run into you two.
You hungry?

29:27.903 --> 29:28.560
Starving.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.445
Good. Let's get ready for
dinner, shall we?

29:30.446 --> 29:32.366
I've just got to grab
a couple of things first.

29:32.367 --> 29:33.960
Sure. See you in a minute.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.000
Denise said I don't have a daddy.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.199
And what did you tell?

29:40.200 --> 29:43.400
I told her I've a big strong daddy
who's in London fighting bad men.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.680
That's right.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.200
That's what you have.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.239
When am I going to see you again?

29:54.150 --> 29:55.000
I don't know.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.400
Before long.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.120
- I have to go to work now, angel.
- Ok.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.240
- How much does Daddy love you?
- All the way to Hawaii.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.319
And back. Tell Mommy I said hi.

30:11.320 --> 30:13.399
I will, Daddy. Bye.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.160
Bye.

30:18.160 --> 30:22.319
- So no body, then?
- No, we couldn't retrieve it.

30:22.320 --> 30:26.399
But I managed to get snaps
of the guys that chopped him up.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.919
Nice.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.160
And I got this.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.039
Hasan's boot.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.720
Hasan didn't wear boots.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.919
Yeah, he did.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.520
(PHONE RINGS)

30:40.040 --> 30:41.959
What?

30:41.960 --> 30:44.679
I had to retire one of Turner's
security men.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.519
Is it clean?
Yeah...

30:46.520 --> 30:48.599
For now.
What about the bid?

30:48.600 --> 30:51.159
Sam thinks it's on the laptop,
in the vault.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.719
No way to access it.
But she's got bigger problems.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.400
Such as?
Bernard Faroux.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.160
What are you talking about?

30:58.161 --> 31:00.160
He's here.
He's one of the other bidders.

31:00.161 --> 31:02.039
Has it compromised Sam?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.439
No, not yet.
But he wants the Turner bid.

31:05.202 --> 31:06.018
I'll talk to Keel.

31:06.348 --> 31:07.828
We need to get her out of there, now.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.800
Not until I've talked to Keel!

31:11.960 --> 31:15.080
You've already lost one of your team.
Are you really willing to lose another?

31:15.081 --> 31:17.360
I'm still looking into
how I lost the first one.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.960
Vodka martini, dirty.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.880
You have it already?

31:33.881 --> 31:37.039
- I'm not here to give you the bid.
- Then what do you want?

31:37.040 --> 31:39.600
Offering you a chance to save your life.

31:40.680 --> 31:44.159
- You're offering me...?
- My employers know you're here.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.598
But they haven't pulled me out.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.520
Which means they're happy to see you dead.

31:47.521 --> 31:49.520
Unless it is your life they're
willing to risk.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.239
But your boss, Mr Keel...

31:54.240 --> 31:56.400
asked to meet with me last week.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.480
He didn't know you'd be here.
No?

32:04.680 --> 32:08.399
Then why would he want to see you?
You went missing in Tangier.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.520
He wanted to know
if I had anything to do with it.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.360
- And did you?
- Your drink, sir.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.160
Bring me the bid. Then we'll talk.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.960
You tell me what you know...

32:30.920 --> 32:32.920
..or I'll kill you.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.319
You can't do anything to me
until after the bidding.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.480
Nor I to you.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.840
Make sure I have the Turner bid by
eight o'clock.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.960
Aidan's requested an immediate exfil.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.999
But Faroux hasn't exposed her?

33:16.000 --> 33:19.760
He wants the Turner bid.
He's a stealth partner with Ceuxron.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.280
He was in London last week.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.640
- How do you know that?
- I met him.

33:27.160 --> 33:31.079
Sam disappeared immediately after
she betrayed him in Tangier.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.279
I thought there might be a connection.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.359
Did he tell you anything?

33:35.360 --> 33:38.399
He denied all knowledge.
He was lying, of course.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.800
- I'll pull her out and scrub the op.
- Let it play.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.159
I believe Sam can handle Bernard Faroux.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.800
And we might learn something
about why she went missing.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.320
All right.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.960
- How long has our man been missing?
- Nearly an hour.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.999
The bid secure?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.359
It's in the vault.
No-one's accessed it.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.759
You bet your bollocks on that?

34:12.760 --> 34:14.040
Of course.

34:15.960 --> 34:19.239
Somebody's screwing with me.
Or trying to.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.520
Where's Lindberg?

34:27.364 --> 34:28.702
- Found something.
- Tell me.

34:29.170 --> 34:32.359
Those men chopping up Hasan - one's
clean...

34:32.360 --> 34:34.399
the other's on probation for assault.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.039
He did community service
out of a club in East London

34:37.040 --> 34:39.520
less than a mile from where
we lost the signal to that case.

34:39.521 --> 34:41.839
I don't see the connection.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.679
Well, it says here that

34:43.679 --> 34:45.998
that club is owned by one David Ryder.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.840
- Jack Turner's buddy.
- No need to thank me.

34:47.841 --> 34:50.679
- For what?
- Finding that missing case.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.799
You haven't found it yet.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.399
Folks...

34:54.400 --> 34:56.880
don't you still have a bone
to pick with Dave Ryder?

34:59.360 --> 35:01.319
(KNOCK ON DOOR) Alex?

35:01.320 --> 35:03.040
Coming.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.480
Would you mind?

35:32.480 --> 35:34.480
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

35:36.960 --> 35:39.519
Your father says that
you should go to dinner without him.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.000
Is something wrong?

35:42.400 --> 35:44.280
He says he'll try to join you later.

35:59.280 --> 36:02.319
Right, make friends. Find the case.
Do you think you can manage that?

36:02.320 --> 36:04.040
Come in with me.
I'll buy you a drink.

36:04.041 --> 36:05.600
Lager and lime girl, right?

36:26.160 --> 36:28.040
Hello, mate, is Dave Ryder about?

36:29.880 --> 36:30.720
Cheers, fella.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.999
- What the hell are you doing here?!
- You should be surprised.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.760
Lucky I can walk after your motor hit me.

36:50.761 --> 36:53.439
You ran out in front of it, boy.

36:53.440 --> 36:56.319
That's your memory playing you up,
Grandad. Alzheimer's.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.640
Terrible disease.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.799
I'll give you ten seconds to walk
away or you'll end

37:05.800 --> 37:07.319
up in a wheelchair.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.519
I'll give you five seconds to
get my two grand.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.679
Two grand, you say?

37:11.680 --> 37:13.480
Get twice that if I went to a solicitor.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.400
Cash or cheque?

37:37.800 --> 37:39.000
How about a drink?

37:58.200 --> 38:00.280
Mr Lindberg? Come with me, please.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.400
Our worries always catch up to us
late at night, don't they?

38:09.320 --> 38:10.760
I brought you something.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.840
My mother used to read it to me
when I was little.

38:19.440 --> 38:21.320
Did it make you feel better?

38:22.520 --> 38:23.480
It did.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.120
Then I'll read it too.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.960
- Good night.
- Night.

39:06.400 --> 39:10.159
You got a face on, Patrik.
Not losing your bottle, are you?

39:10.160 --> 39:12.759
Lars and Polly Holm were
found this evening.

39:13.078 --> 39:14.051
They keeping well?

39:14.381 --> 39:16.239
I think you know how they're keeping.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.559
They're dead.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.679
Tragic.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.719
Good job you didn't wait for him to sign.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.719
Lars Holm was a man of conscience.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.080
Well, you shouldn't let him

39:26.081 --> 39:28.999
find out you were taking backhanders
then, should you, Patrik?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.239
Killing board members wasn't
part of the deal.

39:31.240 --> 39:34.120
I don't remember you moaning
when you were getting paid.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.719
Why did you bring me out here, Mr Turner?

39:45.720 --> 39:48.399
One of my men has gone missing.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.799
I don't know anything about that.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.519
No-one's approached you?
Asked questions about us? Our bid?

39:54.520 --> 39:55.600
Of course not.

39:56.276 --> 39:59.199
I just want out of this whole
filthy business.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.240
It's too late for that, Patrik.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.960
You signed the deal.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.200
(KNOCK ON WINDOW)

41:10.366 --> 41:11.318
I'm staying.

41:11.443 --> 41:13.723
What do you mean, you're
staying? Did you find the case?

41:13.724 --> 41:15.599
Not yet. Dave's not a bad old bugger,
is he?

41:15.600 --> 41:17.439
We're having a bit of a lock-in.

41:17.440 --> 41:20.319
You're getting pissed with Dave?
That's your big plan?

41:20.320 --> 41:22.278
A few more bevvies may be necessary.

41:22.279 --> 41:24.360
But I will find that case for you,
don't you worry.

41:36.349 --> 41:37.479
Who are you?

41:37.480 --> 41:41.519
You were in financial trouble.
Jack Turner offered you a way out.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.720
- Is that it?
- You didn't answer my question.

41:45.160 --> 41:48.799
I'm someone who wants to stop
Turner. Just like you.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.839
I'm calling security.

41:50.840 --> 41:55.279
He's going to kill you, Mr Lindberg.
You do know that?

41:55.280 --> 41:57.599
Turner needs a technical partner.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.599
Turner already killed Holm and his wife.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.320
Do you think he'd hesitate to kill you?

42:01.321 --> 42:03.239
You see, you know too much.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.160
And you've already signed where
Lars Holm refused.

42:08.720 --> 42:11.719
I begged Lars to change his mind.

42:11.720 --> 42:15.039
But I never thought Turner would
hurt him... never.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.040
I believe you.

42:17.520 --> 42:18.960
No-one else will.

42:19.840 --> 42:24.000
- You said you want to stop Turner.
- I do. But I need your help.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.440
I told you we needed to stop.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.720
Natalie?

42:47.160 --> 42:49.399
You think screwing me gives you a pass?

42:49.400 --> 42:50.880
What are you talking about?

42:54.360 --> 42:56.320
You didn't tell me she was back.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.600
I should expose you to Keel right now.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.840
You want to get me killed?

43:05.160 --> 43:06.840
Just like you tried killing her?

43:09.440 --> 43:10.999
What are you accusing me of?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.559
You are the only person I told
about meeting Sam at that cafe.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.120
Tangier?

43:16.600 --> 43:19.199
This whole time,
you thought I put the hit on her?

43:19.200 --> 43:20.800
I know I didn't.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.600
You could've just asked, Aidan...

43:25.800 --> 43:27.479
..instead of screwing me.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.360
Like you'd have confessed.

43:30.800 --> 43:32.480
You bastard.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.039
You've just been using me.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.758
Waiting for me to give something away.

43:36.759 --> 43:38.160
And what have you been doing?

43:40.720 --> 43:43.040
Blackmailing me
to spy against my own employer.

43:44.320 --> 43:47.039
I had nothing to do with
the attempt on Sam Hunter's life.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.000
Then someone else at MI6 did.

43:50.680 --> 43:52.000
You love her, don't you?

43:54.040 --> 43:55.960
That's what this whole thing's about.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.320
This is over between us.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.280
I decide when this is over.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.319
Come on, you're needed.

44:41.320 --> 44:42.400
Come on.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.879
He wants it sorted this morning.

45:10.880 --> 45:13.280
Keep it tidy this time, understand?

45:22.680 --> 45:24.359
Mr Turner, I need to speak to you.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.199
Not a good time, Patrik.

45:26.200 --> 45:28.520
The Frenchman, Bernard Faroux.
He says he has your bid.

45:33.560 --> 45:34.759
He's bluffing.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.960
You told me a man of yours
went missing yesterday.

45:38.680 --> 45:41.599
What about him?
Faroux said he paid him off.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.919
Used him to access your hard
drive in the hotel vault.

45:44.920 --> 45:47.319
He has your bid, Mr Turner.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.280
You can't win.

45:53.560 --> 45:54.640
Bingham.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.320
Monsieur.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.320
- Fish is on the line.
- Standing by.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.159
Hook, line and sinker.
You getting this?

46:47.160 --> 46:49.799
I got it.
Turner's hard drive cloned.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.880
Calling Keel now.

46:55.040 --> 46:59.559
Well? False alarm.
Nobody's copied our bid.

46:59.560 --> 47:01.119
How can you be so sure?

47:01.120 --> 47:02.959
The laptop hasn't been touched.

47:02.960 --> 47:06.560
The file can't be cloned unless
the hard drive's been powered up.

47:10.720 --> 47:12.760
It's powered up now, isn't it?

47:34.400 --> 47:36.240
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

47:36.241 --> 47:39.079
We will now open the financial bids.

47:39.080 --> 47:42.120
Please pass your boxes to the ladies
as they come round, thank you.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.720
Just give me two minutes.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.960
Mr Soomro, unfortunately my father
is running a couple of minutes late.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.640
Just two minutes, that's all I'm asking.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.240
He's here.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.200
The bids have been collected.

48:45.201 --> 48:47.400
We will now open them
in the order received.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.360
Back in a minute.

49:01.440 --> 49:04.679
The first bid is from Ceuxron Investments.

49:04.680 --> 49:07.240
£940,000,000.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.879
Excuse me, do you have the time, please?

49:19.880 --> 49:21.800
Yes, it's eight o'clock. Thanks.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.400
Allons-y.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.720
The second bid
is from Prohurst Investments.

49:34.377 --> 49:36.560
£875,000,000.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.920
The bid from the
Chinese Industries Group...

50:05.160 --> 50:07.840
..is £980,000,000.

50:09.800 --> 50:12.080
It's over, Dad. We're finished.
Wait.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.760
And the final bid...

50:45.440 --> 50:47.080
JTRP Holdings...

50:55.720 --> 50:57.800
£1,000,000,000.

50:58.960 --> 51:02.119
A billion? Our bid was
£970,000,000.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.239
I changed it.

51:04.240 --> 51:05.480
You changed it?

51:05.481 --> 51:07.799
They stole our bid.
We were going to lose.

51:07.800 --> 51:10.519
But it's fraud, Dad.
We're short thirty million quid.

51:10.520 --> 51:12.240
Then we'll just have to get it, won't we?

51:12.241 --> 51:15.159
As the two final bids are within
a tolerance margin...

51:15.160 --> 51:17.599
Tolerance margin?
What's a "tolerance margin"?

51:17.600 --> 51:20.039
There will be a run-off
between JTRP Holdings

51:20.040 --> 51:22.039
and the Chinese Industries Group.

51:22.040 --> 51:24.759
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
We are adjourned for the day.

51:24.760 --> 51:27.640
A run-off. Sodding run-off.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.240
On your knees.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.440
Cafe Khalil.

51:51.640 --> 51:52.680
Was it you?

51:56.040 --> 51:59.480
- And you think I'll tell you now?
- Answer me!

52:08.960 --> 52:12.080
I didn't need to come
looking for you, they already were.

52:13.960 --> 52:15.439
Who?

52:15.440 --> 52:18.320
You're going to die.
They're going to kill you.

52:46.640 --> 52:48.039
Who sent them?

52:48.040 --> 52:49.400
Who?

52:53.760 --> 52:55.400
Hourglass.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.720
What's Hourglass?

53:04.843 --> 53:08.040
You're already dead, you bitch.

53:45.120 --> 53:47.799
Jack Turner's still in the bid.
Despite your best efforts.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.799
He's committed to paying £30,000,000
he doesn't have.

53:50.800 --> 53:54.039
The Pakistanis won't
check his finances until Friday.

53:54.040 --> 53:56.400
By which time he'll have to
forfeit the bid.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.520
Unless he finds the money somehow.

54:01.400 --> 54:02.800
You left behind three bodies.

54:02.801 --> 54:05.600
That's a big clean-up operation,
even for you.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.520
It was your decision to leave me in.

54:08.521 --> 54:11.000
Faroux tell you
anything before you killed him?

54:41.890 --> 54:43.000
You OK?

54:48.403 --> 54:50.563
What's it going to take to get you
to trust me again?

54:53.960 --> 54:55.880
You want me to trust you?

54:57.486 --> 54:59.120
Then you tell me what you know.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.880
No more excuses. No more denials.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.759
Just...

55:05.760 --> 55:07.920
just tell me the truth.

55:15.240 --> 55:16.600
There's nothing to tell.

55:57.040 --> 55:58.879
Find what you're looking for?

55:58.880 --> 56:00.640
One never knows.

56:04.040 --> 56:06.319
This is excellent work, Natalie.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.360
Thank you.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.559
You look tired, George.

56:15.560 --> 56:16.720
You should go home.

56:16.721 --> 56:19.399
To face a garden full of weeds
and a kitchen full of nothing

56:19.400 --> 56:21.560
but ready meals? I think I'd rather
stay here.

56:29.840 --> 56:31.319
Something on your mind?

56:31.320 --> 56:33.280
I was just wondering...

56:36.200 --> 56:37.840
..these reports on Byzantium...

56:39.560 --> 56:41.560
..where do they go?

56:43.160 --> 56:44.280
What do you mean?

56:45.320 --> 56:46.360
I mean...

56:49.240 --> 56:50.760
..who do you share them with?

56:52.480 --> 56:54.239
No-one...

56:54.240 --> 56:56.199
obviously.

56:56.200 --> 56:57.520
Just the Minister.

56:59.240 --> 57:00.200
You're sure?

57:02.400 --> 57:06.960
I give you my word.
If that's still good enough for you.

57:10.840 --> 57:12.920
Good night, Natalie.

57:13.920 --> 57:14.960
Good night, sir.

57:46.640 --> 57:49.159
Jack will kill you.
I said I can handle it.

57:49.160 --> 57:51.319
You said last night
you saw a woman and a man.

57:51.320 --> 57:54.199
Might not have been her.
Might not.

57:54.200 --> 57:57.599
Our mole can't be anyone else,
it's got to be Aidan.

57:57.600 --> 58:00.759
Have you met Natalie Thorpe.
MI6's liaison officer for Byzantium?

58:00.760 --> 58:02.879
The lives of my team are still in danger.

58:02.880 --> 58:05.479
That's what we pay them for, Deacon,
and you.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.440
So what did you get me over here for?

58:07.441 --> 58:09.480
Still want a job?
If you got one going.

58:11.160 --> 58:13.040
Do you know anything about Hourglass?

58:13.041 --> 58:15.680
What's Hourglass?
That's what I need you to tell me.
