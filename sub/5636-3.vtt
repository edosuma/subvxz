Can you help us?

01:03.480 --> 01:06.097
Our planet was taken over

It absorbed

02:11.715 --> 02:12.921

Oh, stop affecting

03:06.895 --> 03:09.853
Stop shifting the cross hairs
to my ironic urban patois

03:09.940 --> 03:11.806
just because your relationship
with your father

03:11.900 --> 03:13.686
is to' up

for yourself, but hey.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.339
So, what's next?

03:41.430 --> 03:43.341
After I become
a type-one civilization,

03:43.432 --> 03:47.050
this world will be invited
into the Galactic Federation.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.134
Oh, goody.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.184
From there,

03:49.271 --> 03:51.057
countless planets

Hey, listen, where can we get
a drink around here?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.957
I watched you assimilate
a whole police station

04:12.043 --> 04:14.125
just to get your hands on
the evidence locker.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.704
Rick, when we met,
I was a young hive mind

04:16.798 --> 04:19.586
with the population
of a small town.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.757
People change...

04:20.844 --> 04:22.005
Especially
when I change them.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.335
I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.012
but I've grown.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.009
Hey, listen,
I've grown, too.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.761
I have!

See, I've -- I've reconnected
with my family, right?

04:30.562 --> 04:32.052
Hm.
Why's that, I wonder?

04:32.147 --> 04:33.854
Maybe it's
part of getting old.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.649
Maybe I just missed
being with a collective.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.736
Yes, Rick. Yes.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.278
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes. Yes.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.322
Wait, wait. Stop.
Hold it.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.025
Not like this.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.029

04:47.120 --> 04:48.360

Uncle Sam costume,

of your largest stadium

04:50.791 --> 04:52.407
covered end to end
with naked redheads,

04:52.501 --> 04:53.957

stands packed

04:54.044 --> 04:56.411

resembles my father.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.338

So coordinated.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.841

They're making you into
a Mount Rushmore.

Morty, open your eyes.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.475
There is no "They."

05:12.562 --> 05:14.929
These poor people's bodies
are being used.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.104
They're a planet

05:16.191 --> 05:17.807

- Ugh.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.359
Well, it seems like
everybody here's cool with it.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.810
Except for
all those redheads.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.191
They seem like
they're in a hurry

05:23.281 --> 05:24.362
to be somewhere else.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.531
Balloon, Summer?
Balloon, Morty?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.529
No, we don't want
your dumb balloons, okay?

05:28.620 --> 05:30.236
We're bored.
Take us back to Rick.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.071
Now's not a good time.

Oh, you know my dad

05:49.182 --> 05:50.343
once he puts his mind
to something.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.015
You're spinning this
to his credit?

05:54.646 --> 05:55.477
I'm going down there.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.180

- Beth, this is my house,

05:57.274 --> 05:59.390
which makes this my garage,
my secret hatch,

05:59.484 --> 06:02.977
my hidden subterranean lair,
and my faceless gargler.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.732

hating this playa

06:04.823 --> 06:06.484
or are you gonna
jack my steez?

06:17.419 --> 06:18.705

06:22.966 --> 06:24.206

06:24.301 --> 06:26.167

hive-mind species,

06:28.054 --> 06:29.089
Beta Seven.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.966
Our planets maintain
a practical alliance

06:31.057 --> 06:32.673
for exchange
of vital resources,

06:32.767 --> 06:34.428
so be nice.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.509
Unity,

06:37.063 --> 06:38.679
is it a bad time?

06:38.773 --> 06:42.732

06:42.819 --> 06:45.561
Beta Seven,
this is my single-minded friend

06:45.655 --> 06:46.736
from Earth, Rick.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.814

06:49.451 --> 06:50.566

Ha ha!

06:52.454 --> 06:53.660
Bleeeeeeeeeh!

06:53.747 --> 06:55.033
Oh, Jesus Christ.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.706
Beta Seven, if my allies
are a problem for you,

06:57.792 --> 06:59.658
perhaps our alliance is,
as well.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.369
Our alliance is beneficial.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.420
When Beta Seven
expresses concern,

07:03.506 --> 07:05.042
it -- it's only
be-because --

07:05.133 --> 07:07.670
Oh, snap!
Powdered neutronium?

07:07.761 --> 07:08.751

07:15.018 --> 07:16.679
It's --

07:16.770 --> 07:19.057
Uh...okay, what the hell.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.935
We can purify the resin
and make fractal dust.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.517
Oh, I was thinking
velocitinis, but --

07:24.611 --> 07:27.524
Aw, old man Rick can't party

07:29.449 --> 07:32.658

you do and more, baby.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.695
You know, I think
Beta Seven over there

07:36.790 --> 07:38.997
is hoping your alliance
can be more than practical.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.620
Stop.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.587
Well, this explains
the $6,000 electric bill.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.085
Whoa!

07:53.682 --> 07:56.800
Well, nice. <i>Real</i> nice.

Wake up, people!
You have to fight it!

08:07.529 --> 08:09.941
You're under the spell
of an evil monster!

08:10.031 --> 08:12.773

08:14.202 --> 08:15.909

Summer?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.072
I'm not talking to you.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.579
I'm talking to...
Steven Phillips.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.162
Steven,
set yourself free.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.543
Summer, before I took
over this planet,

08:28.633 --> 08:31.125
this man was
a registered sex offender.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.881
Yeah? Well, so what?
At least he was himself.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.929
This woman was a drug addict
on the verge of suicide.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.849
Now she's
a marine biologist.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.846
Listen, Unity, I don't think
my sister's trying to say

08:40.937 --> 08:42.222

I think she's just saying
that life would be,

08:44.024 --> 08:45.264
you know, life.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.100
I have transformed life
here into a paradise.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.151
Prostitutes

15:47.655 --> 15:48.861
You think supporting the family

15:48.948 --> 15:50.484
you've got two children

And you force me to
watch it happen...

15:54.495 --> 15:56.987
...because you'd rather
lose them and lose me...

15:57.081 --> 15:58.446
...it's like to be afraid
of losing anything

15:58.541 --> 15:59.531
- than lose him!
- Because you cling...

15:59.625 --> 16:00.581
And why? Because
you're the child, Beth!

16:00.668 --> 16:03.535
You, not me! You!

16:03.629 --> 16:05.165

- Aah!

16:05.256 --> 16:06.746
- Oh, my god.
- Aah!

16:12.221 --> 16:14.337
Um, first of all, hello.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.514
Uh, my name is
Blim Blam the Korblok.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.387
Second of all,
cards on the table,

16:18.478 --> 16:20.185
I'm a murderer
that eats babies,

16:20.271 --> 16:22.763
and I came to this planet
to eat babies.

16:22.857 --> 16:27.602
However, I am also carrying
a highly infectious disease

16:27.695 --> 16:30.983
that I suppose you could call
"Space AIDS" as you put it.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.188
And Rick did
chain me up

16:32.283 --> 16:34.194
so that he could
attempt to cure it.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.322
At the same time,

16:36.412 --> 16:38.323
Rick's motivation
to cure my disease

16:38.414 --> 16:40.496
was not to save my life
or anyone else's,

16:40.583 --> 16:43.746
but to patent and sell the cure
for billions of blemflarcks.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.292
But you know
the reason why

16:45.379 --> 16:47.336
I ripped my chains
out of the wall?

16:47.423 --> 16:50.211
And do you know why I'm never
coming back to this planet?

16:50.301 --> 16:54.169
Because the two of you
are the fucking worst!

16:54.263 --> 16:56.846
You both hate yourselves
and each other.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.174
And the idea that it has
anything to do with Rick

16:59.268 --> 17:00.804
is laughable.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.057
I'd laugh,
but I'm biologically incapable.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.854
<i>That's</i> how alien I am.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.308
And even I'm sitting here
listening to the two of you

17:07.401 --> 17:10.233
and being like,
"What the fuck"!

17:10.320 --> 17:12.436
So good luck
with your shitty marriage,

17:12.531 --> 17:15.569

to deal with <i>either</i> of you.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.027
Blim Blam out.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.371
You know what?
I'm taking this.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.544
How do you --
what is this?

17:34.178 --> 17:37.011
Uh, is there
a slow setting?

17:37.098 --> 17:40.011
Best door ever.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.524
Okay, okay. Now make them cry,
but happy crying.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.818
Now make them all
make fun of the blonde one.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.270
Now make them all
do it on the table.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.527
I can't believe you created
a whole show for me.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.153
Now cancel it.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.279
Okay, now put it back on.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.952
All right, I'm bored.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.450
Rick,
is there a way for you

18:03.541 --> 18:05.077
to call Summer
and Morty?

18:05.167 --> 18:07.499
- I feel bad that they --
- Pbht. Screw those guys.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.999
Ugh.
I'll be right back.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.126
Don't waste your brain
on those weirdos, Unity.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.172
They're no different
from any of the aimless

18:13.259 --> 18:14.545
chumps that you occupy.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.046
They just put you at
the center of their lives

18:16.137 --> 18:17.298
because you're powerful.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.878
And then because
<i>they</i> put you there,

18:18.973 --> 18:20.259
they want you
to be less powerful.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.339
Never gonna happen
though, right?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.515
<i>Never.</i>

18:22.602 --> 18:24.593
Never.
Back in a flash.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.603
Best weekend ever, Rick.

18:31.694 --> 18:35.028
I agree, Rick.
Let's see how long we can go.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.947
Hey, Une.
You got any more --

18:40.536 --> 18:42.948
<i>Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes.</i>

18:43.039 --> 18:46.532
<i>I'm not strong enough
to do it in persons.</i>

18:46.626 --> 18:48.242
<i>I realize now that I'm attracted to you</i>

18:48.336 --> 18:50.577
<i>for the same reason
I can't be with you.</i>

18:50.671 --> 18:52.253
<i>You can't change.</i>

18:52.340 --> 18:54.547
<i>And I have
no problem with that,</i>

18:54.634 --> 18:57.467
<i>but it clearly means
I have a problem with myself.</i>

18:57.553 --> 18:59.885
<i>I'm sure there's no
perfect version of me.</i>

18:59.972 --> 19:02.714
<i>I'm sure I'll just unify
species after species</i>

19:02.808 --> 19:04.549
<i>and never
really be complete.</i>

19:04.644 --> 19:06.555
<i>But I know how it goes with us.</i>

19:06.646 --> 19:09.513
<i>I lose who I am
and become part of you.</i>

19:09.607 --> 19:10.938
<i>Because in a strange way,</i>

19:11.025 --> 19:13.608
<i>you're better at what I do
without even trying.</i>

19:13.694 --> 19:18.655
<i>Yours, and nobody else is,
Unity.</i>

19:19.992 --> 19:22.324
<i>P.S., I don't know where
those coal miners were</i>

19:22.411 --> 19:23.526
<i>before they
were assimilated.</i>

19:23.621 --> 19:25.157
<i>You might want
to get checked.</i>

19:28.376 --> 19:29.366
Hey.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.664
Dad.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.506
I, um -- Jerry and I

19:36.592 --> 19:39.175
were looking for
our weed whacker

19:39.261 --> 19:41.719
and found
your subterranean lair

19:41.806 --> 19:44.298
and your alien prisoner,

19:44.392 --> 19:46.258
and he got away.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.717
And I know
I sound like Mom,

19:47.812 --> 19:49.553
but I can't sacrifice
this whole family's safety

19:49.647 --> 19:51.479
just because I'm afraid
you'll leave again,

19:51.565 --> 19:53.397
so no more alien prisoners

19:53.484 --> 19:56.192
and no more
subterranean excavation

19:56.278 --> 19:57.689
without consulting us.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.771
- Okay.
- Okay?

20:00.116 --> 20:03.029
"Okay" -- like you're gonna
quietly teleport somewhere

20:03.119 --> 20:05.406
- and never come back?
- No. It's your house.

20:05.496 --> 20:08.614
Grandpa Rick,
what happened with Unity?

20:08.708 --> 20:11.325
Who? Oh, Unity.
Yeah, well...

20:11.419 --> 20:13.160
I mean, honestly,
we're talking about an entity

20:13.254 --> 20:14.540
that thrives on
enslavement, you know?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.712
It's not cool. Fun's fun,
but who needs it?

20:16.799 --> 20:18.210
I'll be in the garage.

Unity!

22:09.036 --> 22:10.151
<i>How can I assist you?</i>

22:10.246 --> 22:12.453
I want to talk to
Unity, Beta Seven.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.621
I know it's in there.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.243
<i>You're classified
as a hostile entity,</i>

22:15.334 --> 22:16.950
<i>and Unity
doesn't want to talk to you.</i>

22:17.044 --> 22:17.954
I know your game,
Beta Seven.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.206
I've meta billion of you,

22:19.296 --> 22:21.503
you little on-deck,
in-the-wings shoulder to cry on!

22:21.590 --> 22:24.673
<i>You are classified
as a hostile entity.</i>

22:24.760 --> 22:26.171
Oh, you're just loving this, mother--

22:26.262 --> 22:28.253
this isn't gonna
shake out like you think, pal.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.587
Unity's not into other
hive minds.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.172
It's gonna suck you in
and use you up,

22:31.267 --> 22:32.473
and a month from now,

22:32.560 --> 22:33.550
I'm gonna be making out
with all of you

22:33.644 --> 22:34.509
in a bunch of red wigs!

22:34.603 --> 22:36.594
Unity! Unity!

22:37.189 --> 22:39.305
Unity, I know you can hear me.
Get out here.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.606
<i>Weapons systems engaged.</i>

22:40.693 --> 22:42.400
Oh, in your dreams
you have weapon systems.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.818
Ugh, Rick, you said
we were going to a movie.

22:44.905 --> 22:45.815
We are, Morty.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.567
All right,
Beta shit Seven,

22:47.658 --> 22:49.615
you just got
saved by the bell, bitch!

22:51.287 --> 22:52.618
Did you get any of that?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.070
It's-a good show-a.
