00:01.760 --> 00:03.720
(theme music playing)

01:12.360 --> 01:13.400
(Angela)<i> Love...</i>

01:14.240 --> 01:16.320
<i>is when you look into someone's eyes...</i>

01:17.200 --> 01:22.000
<i>and suddenly you go all the way inside...</i>
<i>to their soul...</i>

01:23.440 --> 01:24.920
<i>and you both know...</i>

01:26.280 --> 01:27.880
<i>instantly.</i>

01:30.880 --> 01:34.920
<i>I always imagined I would fall</i>
<i>in love nursing a blind soldier...</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:37.600
<i>who was wounded in battle.</i>

01:39.200 --> 01:41.880
<i>Or maybe while rescuing someone</i>
<i>in the middle of a blizzard,</i>

01:41.960 --> 01:44.720
<i>seconds before the avalanche hits.</i>

01:46.400 --> 01:50.000
<i>I thought at least by the age of 15,</i>
<i>I would have a love life.</i>

01:50.880 --> 01:53.200
<i>But I don't even have a like life.</i>

01:56.320 --> 01:59.680
And, so, then what did he say?

02:00.160 --> 02:01.480
I think I'm coming down
with something.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.440
-Honey, you're just tired.
-That's what you always say.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.800
-Honey.
-What if I'm not tired?

02:06.880 --> 02:09.240
What if this is
what I really look like now?

02:09.320 --> 02:11.000
Well, then I want a divorce.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.120
Patty, come on.
What did the repair guy say?

02:13.200 --> 02:18.000
He said...
I have not gained six pounds!

02:18.080 --> 02:19.960
Get off. Get back on.
Sometimes it sticks.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.120
Seven pounds?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.120
Oh. Ow!

02:28.200 --> 02:30.640
Excuse me. Could I just have
a little tiny space up here in the corner?

02:32.200 --> 02:35.480
He said that we need
a new printer. He said...

02:35.560 --> 02:38.920
-Do I seem bloated to you?
-Oh, please, not this subject.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.120
-Please, not this subject.
-No, really. Do I seem...

02:42.200 --> 02:44.840
How shall I phrase this, fat?

02:46.760 --> 02:47.720
(spits)

02:48.840 --> 02:50.240
-Um...
-Shut up.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.760
-What day is this?
-Thursday.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.960
No. I mean, the date.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.640
The...12th.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.640
Are you ever coming to bed?

03:12.280 --> 03:14.600
(Angela)
<i>Field trips are so intense.</i>

03:15.760 --> 03:19.200
<i>It's like everybody's been let</i>
<i>out of their cages or something...</i>

03:20.040 --> 03:22.320
<i>and we're all roaming around...</i>

03:23.520 --> 03:26.440
<i>-loose.</i>
-Stay with the group, okay?

03:26.520 --> 03:29.600
The most important thing to remember
is to stay with the group.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.000
The most important thing to remember
is stay with the group.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.760
What is the big deal
with staying with the group?

03:37.840 --> 03:39.840
What if Amelia Earhart
had stayed with the group?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.360
Or Diana Ross?

03:43.200 --> 03:44.920
I have to show you something.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.120
What's that?

03:49.720 --> 03:51.720
I wrote it last night.
I couldn't sleep.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.360
It contains every feeling I've ever wanted
to express about Jordan Catalano.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.880
-"Dear Jordan...."
-Shh!

04:01.160 --> 04:03.520
So, what, are you going to send it to him?

04:03.600 --> 04:07.040
No. Are you crazy?
It's, it's private. I just...

04:08.360 --> 04:09.920
I'm proud of thi...

04:10.760 --> 04:13.440
I don't know. I think...

04:14.440 --> 04:16.160
I'm finally over him.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.600
But, like, what's in it?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.440
Just, you know, everything.

04:22.240 --> 04:26.520
Like, I admit how I was overpoweringly
attracted to him or whatever,

04:26.600 --> 04:29.600
but I point out that he could've
handled things differently,

04:29.680 --> 04:32.640
and he really did not know me at all.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.000
Even though he acted like he did.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.800
And, you know.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.360
Yeah.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.240
I was somewhat obsessed with him
at one time. But, you know, I...

04:44.000 --> 04:47.840
Not anymore because
I've, like, moved beyond that.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.160
So can I read it?

04:50.240 --> 04:51.800
Yeah. Wait.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.720
Don't show this to anyone.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.960
I won't!

04:56.920 --> 04:58.280
God!
(chuckles)

05:12.800 --> 05:14.800
(tranquil music playing)

05:39.000 --> 05:41.680
Chase, she said to stay with the group.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.000
So, you want my number?

06:42.520 --> 06:43.560
So, do you?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.880
(humming)

07:00.920 --> 07:02.600
I've been humming this tune all day.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.320
Oh, like, you can't get it out
of your mind or something?

07:08.120 --> 07:09.400
(Angela)<i> If only there was a button</i>

07:09.480 --> 07:12.400
<i>that I could just push</i>
<i>to force me to stop talking.</i>

07:19.080 --> 07:20.800
I could use a cup of coffee.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.680
-You drink coffee?
-Yeah.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.920
With, like, cream or...

07:28.040 --> 07:30.280
Black with three or four sugars.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.440
-Anyway...
-What is that song?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.560
Is that a Crowded House song?

07:37.280 --> 07:40.440
No. Just this song
that I'm writing.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.160
I'm in this band now,
Frozen Embryos?

07:43.240 --> 07:45.920
You know, with Tino?
So, you should hear us sometime.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.320
We're starting to sound okay.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.240
-Not really, but...
-That's, that's great.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.040
I, I would love to. I mean...

07:54.120 --> 07:56.040
(Rayanne) Angela! Angela!

07:56.120 --> 07:59.000
Yeah, well, anyway.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.240
-Angela, okay, just listen.
-Rayanne, you will not believe this.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.240
-Rayanne, you won't believe this!
-Angela, just listen.

08:05.320 --> 08:08.960
Jordan Catalano was having
a conversation with me, like, on purpose.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.520
-Like, a really nice conversation!
-Don't hate me.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
What?

08:16.280 --> 08:18.680
Do you know that letter thing?

08:18.760 --> 08:22.480
-Oh, no.
-I'm really sorry.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.200
What did you do?

08:24.280 --> 08:26.480
-Did you show it to him?
-No!

08:26.560 --> 08:28.240
(scoffs)

08:30.440 --> 08:31.560
I lost it.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.640
You what?

08:34.720 --> 08:37.480
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I'll find it for you, I swear.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.440
On the plus side...

08:40.040 --> 08:42.520
I met this really cute guard!
(giggles)

08:42.600 --> 08:45.920
Not that at all makes it
worthwhile on, like, any level.

08:47.800 --> 08:52.760
You lost my letter... which means
somebody could have found it.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.960
And Jordan Catalano
was being nice to me...

08:58.080 --> 08:59.560
like, out of nowhere.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.000
(humming)

09:06.680 --> 09:08.240
Oh, my God.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.840
(humming)

09:26.760 --> 09:28.840
(bell ringing)

09:34.440 --> 09:36.160
So, Chase...

09:37.800 --> 09:39.560
you still have
my <i>Malcolm X, </i>right?

09:39.640 --> 09:41.000
Yeah. So?

09:42.720 --> 09:45.520
-So I need it back. Okay?
-Okay.

09:51.560 --> 09:55.760
Look, yesterday on the field trip, this is
going to sound a little weird, but...

09:55.840 --> 09:59.080
Oh. I almost forgot. Here.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.520
I found it at the museum.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.840
You wrote it, right?

10:07.680 --> 10:12.840
Yeah. But when I wrote this,
I wrote this about someone else.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.480
I... this guy...

10:16.560 --> 10:21.560
I had a boyfriend last summer,
and, I wrote everything...

10:23.160 --> 10:24.560
I wanted to remember him

10:24.640 --> 10:29.520
and I used your name
because I wanted...

10:30.840 --> 10:32.960
I didn't want other people
to know it was about him

10:33.040 --> 10:35.480
because he died.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.080
He's dead.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.600
Look, I didn't read it, okay?
So you don't have to, like...

10:47.680 --> 10:49.360
You expect me to believe that?

10:50.640 --> 10:53.520
-I don't care what you believe.
-(laughs)

10:53.600 --> 10:56.600
Well, you find a five-page
letter in a museum,

10:56.680 --> 10:58.760
it starts "Dear Jordan,"

10:58.840 --> 11:00.840
you expect me to believe
you didn't read it?

11:02.080 --> 11:03.440
Never mind.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.280
-Look, I read parts of it, okay?
-What?

11:08.280 --> 11:10.760
You must really think I'm stupid.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.920
It just didn't hold my interest,
okay?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.480
Oh, really? Why is that?

11:15.560 --> 11:18.880
I'm curious.
I'd really like to know what it was

11:18.960 --> 11:21.160
that made it so incredibly boring.

11:21.240 --> 11:25.160
Just tell me. Was it, was it
too emotional? Too personal?

11:25.240 --> 11:27.280
-Too many big words...
-Shut up!

11:27.360 --> 11:28.480
Jeez.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.280
You couldn't read it.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.880
That's it, isn't it?

11:52.960 --> 11:56.320
I never told anyone, before.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.720
Catalano.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.240
I just talked to Tino.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.480
Man, he said he can get us
that loft tonight.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.160
-Cool.
-Yeah. So rehearsal's on.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.520
Okay, well...

12:14.600 --> 12:16.200
We should tell the other Embryos.

12:17.720 --> 12:18.800
I guess so.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.680
So you have rehearsal tonight?

12:22.760 --> 12:24.760
I guess so. Yeah.

12:25.720 --> 12:29.160
Maybe I could hear that song
you wrote sometime.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.120
Sure. I mean, yeah.

12:32.200 --> 12:36.520
We're rehearsing tonight at this
loft that Tino found, so...

12:38.160 --> 12:41.520
So you mean I should
go to the loft tonight?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.160
Well, you know...

12:45.120 --> 12:47.480
-Whatever.
-(Kyle) Catalano! Let's go!

12:54.600 --> 12:57.880
-Wait. Say this again?
-Something has happened

12:57.960 --> 12:59.800
between Jordan Catalano and me,

12:59.880 --> 13:03.680
and I can't, I can't explain it.
I seriously can't.

13:03.760 --> 13:09.960
Don't even ask me, but,
I understand him in this way

13:10.040 --> 13:12.200
I didn't even know existed,

13:12.280 --> 13:16.120
and it has completely changed everything.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.840
-Everything.
-(laughs)

13:19.880 --> 13:22.360
-Well, how late?
-Eight days.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.240
-Eight fun-filled...
-You're eight days late?

13:25.320 --> 13:29.600
-Shh! Yeah.
-You're never late!

13:29.680 --> 13:32.920
Of course, this could just,
you know, mean,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.560
well, it could be pre-menopause.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.280
What?

13:37.360 --> 13:40.440
Don't get all insulted.
I said "Pre."

13:40.520 --> 13:45.160
Pre-menopause? What...
Is that like pre-death?

13:45.240 --> 13:48.080
Well, it just means
at this stage of the game,

13:48.160 --> 13:52.160
that, you know, your periods
could get a little funky.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.040
-Funky.
-Sporadic.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.080
Look, let's face it.

13:59.280 --> 14:04.440
Finally, someday we are gonna
come to the end of our eggs.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.520
(slurps empty cup)

14:06.600 --> 14:09.320
You know that this had never
occurred to me?

14:09.400 --> 14:11.120
God, this is so depressing.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.120
A man loses a little hair,
he buys a great sports car.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.760
I know.

14:16.840 --> 14:19.440
But it's supposed
to be very gradual.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.640
It's going to take,
like, 10 years or something.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.960
We end up looking like Germaine Greer
on the back of that book.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.440
I plan on looking like
Tina Turner when I'm 50.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.280
Patty, we're 40!

14:36.360 --> 14:38.520
40 is still considered young!

14:38.600 --> 14:40.960
Look, you're not going
through menopause!

14:41.040 --> 14:46.440
Well, so what are you saying,
that, I could be pregnant?

14:47.040 --> 14:50.080
Are you kidding? At your age?

14:50.160 --> 14:52.200
Tell her the best part!

14:53.720 --> 14:56.600
He asked her to watch
Frozen Embryos rehearse tonight,

14:56.680 --> 14:58.960
which I have been wanting
to do so bad.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.280
So, wait.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.640
What was this thing
that changed him?

15:03.720 --> 15:06.400
It's not something I can talk about.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.400
All I can say is that it involves
that letter.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.280
Aah! I knew it!

15:12.360 --> 15:14.640
He found the letter,
it made him want you.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.360
Right? Am I right?

15:18.080 --> 15:21.960
Angelica!
Do you know what this means?

15:22.040 --> 15:24.360
-Yes, I do.
-Yes!

15:26.240 --> 15:27.440
What does it mean?

15:29.200 --> 15:33.200
It means this is happening.
You're happening.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.040
You and Jordan Catalano.

15:37.280 --> 15:41.040
And who's the person without
who none of this would be happening?

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
Hmm?

15:42.200 --> 15:47.000
Who is the genius, who lost the
stupid letter in the first place?

15:47.080 --> 15:50.080
Who should you be thanking
for the rest of your life?

15:50.160 --> 15:51.440
Thank you.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.600
Don't mention it. I gotta go.
I gotta beep George.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.200
George?

15:57.280 --> 15:59.800
-That museum guard?
-Mm.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.160
So...

16:04.000 --> 16:05.160
congratulations.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.160
I haven't seen him
since it happened.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.120
If I ran into him,
I'd probably faint.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.920
You won't. He has shop fifth
period Mondays and Wednesdays,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.560
and he never cuts shop.

16:17.120 --> 16:20.640
I know because I used to
pass him on the way to computer.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.080
Oh. Great.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.520
When?

16:25.560 --> 16:26.520
I don't know.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.640
The night we watched
<i>The Nutty Professor</i> on cable?

16:30.720 --> 16:34.240
-That was like two months ago.
-I put the stupid thing in.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.600
-I mean, the diaphragm.
-Oh, right.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.920
Look, it's not like
there were that many times.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
How can you say that?
There've been tons of times!

16:43.080 --> 16:46.200
What about... what about the night
that Danielle stayed over at Stacy's?

16:46.280 --> 16:48.280
How many of these have you eaten?

16:48.360 --> 16:49.640
Graham...

16:51.680 --> 16:52.880
What if it's a boy?

16:54.320 --> 16:55.880
Patty, it's not a boy.
It's not anything

16:55.960 --> 16:58.280
because it's not happening.
You're not pregnant.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.040
-You feel like it might be a boy?
-No.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.760
What am I saying?
There's no way that I could...

17:05.840 --> 17:07.120
Brian.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.560
Honey, look. It's, it's Brian. Krakow.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.000
It was open.

17:11.080 --> 17:15.560
See, I loaned Angela <i>Malcolm X.</i>

17:15.640 --> 17:18.520
I read it already,
but I have to reread it.

17:18.600 --> 17:22.640
Well, Angela's not here.
She's at band practice...

17:22.720 --> 17:23.720
-Yes.
-Tonight.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.520
I guess she's thinking of joining.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.680
You're in band, aren't you?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.440
At least, you play the flute.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.040
He plays the saxophone.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.640
So, actually, I play both.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.120
Because they say colleges like it
if you play more than one instrument.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.840
You have to play them both
at once, or...

17:47.040 --> 17:50.600
Well, I'm not allowed
in Angela's room without a visa.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.520
I'll tell her you came, though.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.480
Right.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.400
Okay.

17:55.480 --> 17:59.400
So, what's this thing
that Angela went to again?

17:59.480 --> 18:00.600
I don't know.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.120
But there must be
someone there she likes.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.560
She changed clothes
eight different times.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.000
Is the saxophone hard to play?

18:07.960 --> 18:10.040
I'm interested in the saxophone.

18:10.120 --> 18:13.080
-Maybe you could teach me to play.
-Sure, I guess so.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.080
When?

18:15.480 --> 18:17.480
Maybe tomorrow night.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.800
Uh, so she changed clothes?

18:19.880 --> 18:23.280
Yeah. So did you mean it,
about the lessons?

18:23.880 --> 18:25.320
Will Angela be there?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.120
I mean, 'cause I need that book.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.960
Just come over.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.120
I can find the book.

18:30.200 --> 18:34.560
(door opens and closes)

18:37.000 --> 18:39.080
(man 1) Hey, plug in my amp.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.640
Make sure the gain's turned down.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.440
(man 2) Hello.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.400
Let's go.
They're totally ignoring us.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.720
Not yet.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.680
If only Tino would get here
so they'd play something.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.880
Or I could at least drink more.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.160
I'm calling George again.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.520
(Angela)<i> Huge events take place</i>
<i>on this earth every day.</i>

19:10.600 --> 19:14.520
<i>Earthquakes, hurricanes,</i>
<i>even glaciers move.</i>

19:15.240 --> 19:18.680
<i>So why couldn't he just,</i>
<i>look at me?</i>

19:18.760 --> 19:19.560
(Jordan) Hey.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.560
You wanna hear the song
I was telling you about?

19:27.520 --> 19:29.840
(guitar playing)

19:35.760 --> 19:39.600

19:39.680 --> 19:43.480

20:43.160 --> 20:46.200

20:48.040 --> 20:49.960
That's all I have so far.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.280
-Oh, my God, Rickie.
-Angela...

20:57.360 --> 20:59.680
So, you are gonna stay, right?

20:59.760 --> 21:02.560
-I don't know.
-Well, stay. You should.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.160
I mean, that's the whole point,
right?

21:04.240 --> 21:06.040
Stay.
Hear the rest of the rehearsal.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.840
We have to go. We should go.
But if you wanna stay...

21:08.920 --> 21:10.520
-Do you wanna stay?
-Do you?

21:10.600 --> 21:12.480
-I could...
-Then stay.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.800
We're going. Bye. Bye!

21:25.760 --> 21:27.360
I don't think Tino is coming.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.240
I'm gonna get out of here.
You want a ride somewhere?

21:32.320 --> 21:33.440
Okay.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.920
Okay.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.960
(crickets chirping, dog barking)

21:49.480 --> 21:51.160
I was just thinking...

21:53.680 --> 21:55.560
could you maybe have dyslexia?

21:56.160 --> 21:57.680
What, that backwards thing?

21:59.280 --> 22:01.480
Lots of people have it.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.400
My father's brother has it.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.600
It makes reading incredibly difficult
'cause your mind, like...

22:07.680 --> 22:09.840
Let's not talk about this.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.040
Reverses things.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.280
I'm sorry.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.080
It's actually not...

22:21.480 --> 22:25.280
I mean, a lot of really
intelligent people are dyslexic.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.080
Just because a person
can't read...

22:27.160 --> 22:30.160
Hey. I can read. Okay?

22:32.560 --> 22:33.560
Just not...

22:35.280 --> 22:36.640
No. I know.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.560
Just not that good.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.600
You know those guys...

22:51.760 --> 22:53.080
up in the mountains?

22:56.680 --> 22:57.680
What guys?

22:59.720 --> 23:01.280
Who make snow, like...

23:04.640 --> 23:06.080
like, as their job.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.120
Yeah.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.240
I'd really like to do that.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.640
You mean, part time, or...

23:35.440 --> 23:36.520
Sorry.

23:38.920 --> 23:39.800
For what?

23:41.600 --> 23:43.760
I interrupted you.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.320
Yeah.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.400
Thanks.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.000
(slow music playing)

23:56.560 --> 23:57.640
Okay.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.400
Yeah.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.440
Okay.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.960
(door opens)

24:13.040 --> 24:14.280
(engine starts)

24:15.400 --> 24:16.640
(door closes)

24:46.120 --> 24:50.080
(door opens and closes)

24:55.640 --> 24:59.160
(theme music playing)

25:13.840 --> 25:17.920
(Patty) Angela, do you hear me?
You're going to be late.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.120
Exactly when did I turn
into Auntie Em?

25:20.200 --> 25:22.040
How soon can you take the test?

25:22.120 --> 25:24.080
Tomorrow. Tomorrow,
I will take it. And hopefully...

25:24.160 --> 25:26.040
Yes, honey? What is it?

25:26.120 --> 25:27.400
Angela's in love.

25:35.520 --> 25:38.240
(humming)

25:39.320 --> 25:41.480
She's drinking coffee.

25:41.560 --> 25:42.880
And humming.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.480
I can go out on dates, right?

25:57.960 --> 26:00.280
Of course, you can go out on dates.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.240
But we do have ground rules.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.440
Like what?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.400
Like what?

26:04.480 --> 26:06.960
(liquid pouring)

26:07.880 --> 26:11.640
Like, you have a curfew...

26:12.800 --> 26:15.800
and... we have to know
where you're going

26:15.880 --> 26:19.000
and whoever else
is going to be there,

26:19.080 --> 26:21.800
and we have to have
an understanding about drinking,

26:21.880 --> 26:24.080
namely that you're not going
to be doing any.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.480
If a boy that you're out with
takes a drink,

26:27.560 --> 26:29.800
then you have to swear
on a stack of bibles

26:29.880 --> 26:32.240
that you won't
let him drive you home,

26:32.320 --> 26:34.200
and...

26:34.800 --> 26:37.640
And, of course, we have to
meet him first, whoever he is...

26:39.200 --> 26:40.760
and...

26:42.840 --> 26:44.080
that's it.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.600
Wow.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.440
You have to meet him first?

26:50.560 --> 26:51.920
Uh, yes.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.160
Like a little milk in your coffee?

26:55.560 --> 26:58.200
No. I take it black
with three or four sugars.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.560
Oh, I see.

26:59.640 --> 27:03.600
Why do you have to meet him first?
That's humiliating.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.000
I mean, this person
means something to me.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.320
There is a person
who means something to you?

27:09.320 --> 27:12.280
Yeah. I don't see
why you can't trust that.

27:12.360 --> 27:15.400
Why do I have to parade him
around in front of you?

27:15.480 --> 27:19.200
'Cause we want to drag you down
to our level.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.240
So, say it was somebody
you knew.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.440
Then I wouldn't have
to introduce him to you

27:29.520 --> 27:32.000
'cause you'd already know him.
Right?

27:33.280 --> 27:34.280
Go to school.

27:37.640 --> 27:38.560
(chuckles)

27:39.520 --> 27:42.120
And you want to go through
with this with a third one?

27:42.200 --> 27:45.240
I'm not saying I want to.
I'm just saying...

27:46.840 --> 27:48.400
what if it's true?

27:51.480 --> 27:53.120
Hm. Do you want it to be true?

27:54.600 --> 27:55.960
Do you?

27:58.520 --> 28:01.320
When he's, uh, 40, we'll be...

28:02.800 --> 28:03.760
dead.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.960
Rayanne Graff's staring at us.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.720
So?

28:16.800 --> 28:18.400
She's so low.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.360
She's so disgusting.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.600
The other day at the museum,

28:22.680 --> 28:25.200
I heard she had sex
with one of the guards.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.560
Oh, get over it.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.760
What?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.200
Well, face it.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.160
If a guy did that
on a field trip,

28:33.240 --> 28:35.240
you and your friends
would give him a medal.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.120
Hey, I'm just making conversation.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.880
Besides, I thought you hated her.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.080
I do. Of course, I do.

28:43.920 --> 28:47.240
I just think there's a lot
of great reasons to hate her

28:47.320 --> 28:49.280
without dragging in her sex life.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.200
It was amazing.

28:54.280 --> 28:58.200
I keep running it over
and over in my mind like it was a movie.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.800
That's just what I would do.

28:59.880 --> 29:04.800
I want to see him so much,
but I don't just want to see him

29:04.880 --> 29:06.960
with, like, no preparation.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.880
That's exactly how I would be.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.480
Look, he usually goes
to P.E. on Thursdays,

29:13.560 --> 29:17.160
so be on the north side of the gym
as fifth period lets out...

29:17.880 --> 29:19.040
Rickie.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.280
You don't have to say it.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.360
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.840
Hi.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.720
Oh, hi. Hi.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.960
Hi.

29:36.520 --> 29:37.320
Hi.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.800
Hey.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.080
So, what's up?

29:45.120 --> 29:47.960
I can't get that song you wrote,
like, out of my mind.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.000
I'm still not done
writing that, so...

29:50.480 --> 29:52.360
Well, there's this movie,

29:52.440 --> 29:55.520
and, and it kind of reminds me
of your song,

29:55.600 --> 29:58.640
or your song kind of reminds me
of the movie,

29:58.720 --> 30:03.000
but hearing it kind of makes me
want to go to the movie again.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.000
(indistinct chatter)

30:09.360 --> 30:10.360
Oh.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.320
Yeah. We could do that.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.000
Yeah, but the thing is...

30:17.640 --> 30:19.920
this is going to sound so weird.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.320
My parents are,
like, from the stone age,

30:22.400 --> 30:24.600
but they have to meet you...

30:25.960 --> 30:26.960
before.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.480
Before what?

30:32.240 --> 30:34.160
Before we could go to the movie.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.000
Oh.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.360
Yeah. Okay.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.560
Yeah. I mean,
you could just come by,

30:46.640 --> 30:51.000
like, tonight, you know,
anytime, and it'd be settled.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.440
We could just go to the movie
anytime this weekend.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.480
Catalano, let's go!

30:57.640 --> 31:02.480
So would you want to do that,
like, tonight, say, around 7:30?

31:03.360 --> 31:05.800
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

31:11.400 --> 31:13.320
-What was that about?
-Just shut up.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.360
(Graham) I wasn't expecting
to meet this guy so soon.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.400
I wasn't expecting to meet
any guy so soon.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.680
Well, neither was I, I guess, but we are.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.560
I guess she's serious about him.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.440
Listen, I think you'd
better prepare yourself.

31:29.520 --> 31:33.840
I get the definite feeling that
this kid is very good-looking.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.040
So, what,
you think I can't handle that?

31:37.120 --> 31:39.480
-God, how did it come to this?
-I don't know.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.760
-You and your ground rules.
-What should I suppose to say?

31:42.840 --> 31:45.000
We can't keep her locked
in her room.

31:45.080 --> 31:50.320
Why not? No, really. How did locking
kids in their room get such a bad rap?

31:50.400 --> 31:53.840
I don't know.
Look at me. I'm bloated,

31:53.920 --> 31:56.280
and I'm very, very interested
in chocolate.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.080
(doorbell rings)

32:00.120 --> 32:01.520
Okay.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.280
Aah! It's only Brian.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.840
Come on in.
Angela, Brian's here.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.160
(Brian) Anyway,
so Danielle seemed interested,

32:18.240 --> 32:20.160
so I thought I'd show her
how the sax works.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.920
-And I still need my <i>Malcolm X.</i>
-Here's your book.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.720
-How come you look like that?
-Like what?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.320
(Patty) Brian, you like
something to drink?

32:30.400 --> 32:33.000
I definitely need a drink.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.800
You just look like you're going to
a costume party as someone else.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.200
So, where we're gonna have it,
the lesson?

32:43.280 --> 32:46.320
Look, if you must know,
Jordan Catalano is coming over.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.480
What?

32:47.560 --> 32:51.040
Yeah, shut up. Why is it so amazing?
I'm sorry if you disapprove.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.840
I don't disapprove.
I'm just sickened.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.120
-Please just get out here, will you?
-(Patty) Danielle!

32:55.200 --> 32:56.640
(Graham)
Honey, come in here for a second!

32:56.720 --> 32:58.680
No. Anyway, he's here to see me.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.640
So what, you and Jordan Catalano are,
like, a couple?

33:00.720 --> 33:02.680
Yes.
Why is that so hard to accept?

33:02.760 --> 33:03.880
He's coming over.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.520
And we're probably gonna see
the <i>Bicycle Thief</i> this weekend together.

33:07.600 --> 33:11.280
What? You think Jordan Catalano will
understand one word of <i>Bicycle Thief</i>?

33:11.360 --> 33:12.200
Shut up!

33:12.280 --> 33:13.680
You only understand because I explained...

33:13.760 --> 33:15.280
That's such a lie!

33:15.360 --> 33:17.360
You're bringing Jordan Catalano,
that idiot...

33:17.440 --> 33:19.280
Don't you dare call him that!

33:20.240 --> 33:22.520
You don't know.
You don't understand.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.520
Not for one second.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.560
You think you understand,
but you don't!

33:26.640 --> 33:29.480
You just analyze everything
until it barely even exists.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.960
(guitar tuning)

33:45.040 --> 33:48.120
It's Tino. He says we should meet him
over on Clybourn. There's a party.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.120
Yeah.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.480
Okay. Yeah.

33:55.320 --> 33:59.320
Let's go. There's nothing to eat
here anyways. Yo, Catalano.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.400
Come on.

34:00.480 --> 34:01.960
(guitar picking)

34:02.040 --> 34:06.160
No, there's this,
this thing I said I would do.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.040
What thing?

34:08.120 --> 34:11.720
Just this thing,
that I said I would do.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.840
(Tino) Well, whatever.

34:14.440 --> 34:17.960
(guitar melody and humming)

34:37.960 --> 34:39.200
We kept it loose.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.800
It wasn't definite.
It wasn't like a date.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.680
Oh, we know that.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.600
Actually, I'm pretty tired.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.040
I think I'm going to go to bed.

34:58.120 --> 35:01.560
(guitar melody
and humming resume)

35:04.760 --> 35:10.360
<i>♪ She's my shelter from the storm ♪</i>

35:10.440 --> 35:16.680
<i>♪ She's a place to rest my head ♪</i>

35:16.760 --> 35:18.280
<i>♪ Late at night ♪</i>

35:18.360 --> 35:21.600
<i>♪ She keeps me safe ♪</i>

35:21.680 --> 35:25.800

35:25.880 --> 35:27.960
(crying)

35:31.920 --> 35:33.880
<i>♪ Red ♪</i>

35:45.840 --> 35:48.320
(Angela)
<i>This life has been a test.</i>

35:51.080 --> 35:52.840
<i>If it had been an actual life,</i>

35:52.920 --> 35:57.360
<i>you would have received instructions</i>
<i>on where to go and what to do.</i>

36:15.080 --> 36:17.560
(toilets flush)

36:29.080 --> 36:30.680
What?

36:30.760 --> 36:32.480
So have you and Kyle
gone all the way yet?

36:35.280 --> 36:38.080
That is completely
none of your business.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.080
Duh?

36:40.960 --> 36:43.280
Look, I know
it's none of my business.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.640
And we're totally not friends,

36:44.720 --> 36:46.960
due to the fact neither of us
can stand each other.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.200
That's why I asked you.

36:51.040 --> 36:54.680
Go ahead. Ask me anything.
Go ahead, it's, like, relaxing.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.720
You're so weird.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.560
Duh squared.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.520
Okay, look...

37:14.720 --> 37:16.680
I made a solemn promise to myself

37:16.760 --> 37:19.240
that I would not go all the way
until I was ready.

37:20.840 --> 37:24.200
And I'm, like, sticking to that.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.320
Oh.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.440
I was just vaguely curious,

37:31.520 --> 37:35.240
'cause, I mean, when I saw you
making out with Kyle in the hall...

37:36.600 --> 37:41.080
I mean, you act
like you're reaching ecstasy.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.080
Well, yeah.

37:45.040 --> 37:49.040
Well, I mean, I mean,
well, you know how that is.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.760
Oh, yeah.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.320
In a way.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.280
I mean, it's fun and all,
you know, but...

37:58.360 --> 38:00.640
I don't always feel anything.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.200
Sometimes I feel, like...

38:03.640 --> 38:05.360
numb or something.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.840
Maybe you just haven't found
the right person yet.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.280
I've tried every type of person.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.880
Look, no big deal.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.160
You don't have to look
all worried or anything.

38:25.160 --> 38:28.560
(Angela) God, Rayanne,
I wish I could be like you.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.800
I mean, your relationships may be short,
but at least they're real.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.600
At least you're not
making them all up.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.360
You haven't
even heard his side yet.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.920
I don't want to hear his side.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.400
I never want to see him again
for the rest...

38:46.960 --> 38:50.440
(Angela) <i>It was kind of like driving</i>
<i>by a horrible car accident.</i>

38:51.840 --> 38:53.920
<i>You just had to look.</i>

39:09.120 --> 39:10.680
She's a little upset.

39:12.200 --> 39:16.680
I guess, well, because...
Well, never mind.

39:16.760 --> 39:17.920
No, what?

39:20.040 --> 39:21.920
I guess she figures,
you know...

39:22.000 --> 39:24.680
Why didn't you,
you call or something?

39:28.160 --> 39:29.720
Yeah, that makes sense.

39:32.560 --> 39:36.000
She just... she, like, wanted me
to meet her parents.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.160
I just...

39:39.480 --> 39:41.800
I wasn't in the mood, you know?

39:41.880 --> 39:45.480
It's like she, she, she knows
too much about me or something?

39:46.400 --> 39:51.920
Not really, but she just makes
too big a deal out of everything.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.320
I mean, she makes everything
too complicated.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.760
Anyway...

39:58.840 --> 40:03.160
Well, it, it was partly
that song that you wrote.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.760
She, she really liked it.

40:04.840 --> 40:09.200
And it was obvious
what, what it was about, so...

40:09.280 --> 40:10.560
Yeah.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.240
My car.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.520
(bell rings)

40:21.200 --> 40:22.840
Patty?

40:22.920 --> 40:25.000
So how's the test going?
Did you flunk?

40:26.360 --> 40:28.880
No, seriously, hon,
do you know anything yet?

40:30.120 --> 40:31.280
I can't believe it.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.160
Huh.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.120
It's a miracle.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.120
Oh, sweetheart.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.800
-Oh, God.
-I got my period.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.280
-Oh.
-(both chuckles)

40:52.360 --> 40:53.760
Okay.

40:53.840 --> 40:58.000
-Just for a second, I thought...
-I feel such relief,

40:58.080 --> 41:02.120
such gratitude for my life,
my freedom.

41:02.960 --> 41:08.480
I mean, the idea of actually
starting over again

41:08.560 --> 41:12.600
right now with another child,
when I'm just beginning to...

41:12.680 --> 41:13.640
Ohh.

41:15.280 --> 41:19.120
I just... don't want to go back
there now.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.400
(sighs)

41:30.040 --> 41:31.640
Oh, Graham.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.560
-Hunh.
-Oh, sweetheart...

41:36.680 --> 41:38.640
you wanted a son.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.160
Well, maybe just a little.

41:42.240 --> 41:46.360
It's not like I go around
wanting one, all the time.

41:52.120 --> 41:55.080
I guess I just sort of fell
in love with the idea of...

41:56.200 --> 41:57.200
having a son.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.560
Honey, I'm sorry.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.320
I thought you were past
all that now.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.000
I thought so, too.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.720
(knock on door)

42:12.440 --> 42:13.520
(door opens)

42:15.040 --> 42:16.840
I come bearing ice cream.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.320
It's cookie dough.

42:20.360 --> 42:23.400
You can... eat it
right out of the carton.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.960
Mom, if you care
about me at all,

42:25.040 --> 42:28.200
do not attempt to cheer me up
because it's not possible.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.760
You can leave the ice cream.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.440
You know, I wasn't going
to try to cheer you up.

42:41.840 --> 42:46.720
I wouldn't presume to think
that anything I could say

42:46.800 --> 42:48.160
would lift your spirits.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.680
Well, good, because you can't.

42:53.040 --> 42:56.040
It's ironic, isn't it? Emotions.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.320
(chuckles)

42:58.400 --> 43:01.720
I mean, all this week, I was
so afraid that I was pregnant...

43:01.800 --> 43:02.880
What?

43:05.400 --> 43:06.920
You're not, are you?

43:07.000 --> 43:10.280
No. I said I thought,

43:10.360 --> 43:13.000
incorrectly as it turns out,
that I might...

43:14.320 --> 43:15.400
accidentally...

43:15.480 --> 43:16.720
(exhaled laugh)

43:16.800 --> 43:18.360
...have become pregnant.

43:18.440 --> 43:19.840
Mom!

43:19.920 --> 43:22.520
(laughs)

43:22.600 --> 43:25.480
It wasn't that funny.

43:28.120 --> 43:30.080
Oh, I'm so pleased,

43:30.160 --> 43:32.280
that I've been able to
brighten your day.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.400
(laughing louder and louder)

43:35.480 --> 43:37.640
(kid 1) Come on. I said pass it.

43:37.720 --> 43:39.280
(thwack)

43:39.360 --> 43:40.320
I got it.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.480
-(Graham) Hi.
-Hi.

43:42.560 --> 43:43.960
Angela isn't there.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.080
Would you still like me
to give you a saxophone lesson?

43:48.160 --> 43:49.280
No.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.160
I guess that answers
your question, huh?

43:59.000 --> 44:02.800
Why is dad playing catch
with Brian Krakow?

44:02.880 --> 44:04.760
I guess if you live
with three women,

44:04.840 --> 44:06.720
that would make any man desperate.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.760
Hello.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.240
Here. Why don't you play?

44:13.320 --> 44:14.800
Take over.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.200
What did your parents think
of Jordan Catalano?

44:22.280 --> 44:24.760
Were they, like, revolted?

44:24.840 --> 44:28.040
We are not talking about
Jordan Catalano ever again.

44:28.880 --> 44:29.840
We're not?

44:32.680 --> 44:34.240
Okay, we're not.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.760
Why not?

44:38.560 --> 44:41.800
Because you are incapable
of understanding.

44:42.400 --> 44:43.640
Oh, yeah? Why?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.240
Because it's never
happened to you.

44:47.320 --> 44:51.440
I'm just... wait till it happens to you,
Brian.

44:52.360 --> 44:55.000
Seriously, I cannot wait
until it happens to you

44:55.080 --> 44:58.560
because I'm going to look at you
and I'm going to laugh.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.120
And I'll say, "See?

45:01.080 --> 45:02.040
See?

45:03.640 --> 45:05.400
I told you so."

45:05.480 --> 45:08.840
(dramatic music playing)

45:22.720 --> 45:25.960

46:02.040 --> 46:06.440
