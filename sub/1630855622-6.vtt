[knife scraping]

00:11.469 --> 00:14.222
- You know what
a death roll is?

00:14.264 --> 00:17.517
It's how alligators
kill their prey.

00:17.559 --> 00:23.023
You see, gators
are ancient creatures,

00:23.064 --> 00:25.817
violent things.

00:25.859 --> 00:30.238
Their bite's strong
it can cut through bone.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.532
But they can't chew.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.869
So when they clamp down
on their prey

00:35.910 --> 00:37.662
and they pull it underwater

00:37.704 --> 00:41.958
and they start flipping over
faster and faster,

00:42.000 --> 00:44.544
round and round,

00:44.586 --> 00:48.256
it's like a washer
on a spin cycle,

00:48.298 --> 00:51.926
'cept it's not cleanin'
dirty undies, uh-uh.

00:59.100 --> 01:03.396
It's tearin' limbs from sockets

01:03.438 --> 01:07.108
and muscle from bones.

01:07.150 --> 01:13.114
The prey is literally
ripped to shreds.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.576
So why am I telling you this?

01:16.618 --> 01:20.747
Because that's what
you're doin' to us, Lorraine.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.750
You're putting us
in a fucking death roll!

01:23.792 --> 01:25.043
- Ma'am, I understand

01:25.085 --> 01:27.212
that COBRA can be
an expensive option

01:27.253 --> 01:29.089
for continued
health insurance coverage.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.926
- Oh, you think?
It's fuckin' $700 a month

01:32.967 --> 01:34.636
per participant!

01:34.678 --> 01:37.222
- It's only intended
as an emergency option

01:37.263 --> 01:39.641
after job loss,
but the good news is,

01:39.683 --> 01:43.019
your current plan doesn't
expire for another ten days.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.646
- Ten fucking days?

01:44.688 --> 01:47.524
I tried to book a cardiologist
for Ray-Nathan.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.276
They didn't have an appointment
for six months.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.653
- I don't need a cardiologist,
Mom.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.822
- You got the high blood
pressure, Ray-Nathan.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.198
- And I'm cutting back
on my sodium.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.117
I switched from McGriddles
to McMuffins.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.368
- Ma'am,
if there's nothing else,

01:58.410 --> 01:59.619
I'd appreciate if you could
stay on the line

01:59.661 --> 02:02.122
for a quick
customer satisfaction survey.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.415
- Oh, I'll give you
your feedback

02:03.456 --> 02:05.125
right fuckin' now.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.002
You're part of the cancer

02:07.043 --> 02:11.798
that is destroying the soul
of America, Lorraine!

02:11.840 --> 02:14.634
- Okay, well, we understand
that you have a choice

02:14.676 --> 02:15.844
when it comes
to health insurance,

02:15.885 --> 02:17.929
and we do appreciate
your business.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.889
- I hope you die, Lorraine!

02:19.931 --> 02:22.142
Zero stars!

02:27.105 --> 02:29.232
- Craig,
if you're watching this,

02:29.274 --> 02:31.401
I want you to know
that I am okay,

02:31.443 --> 02:32.944
but the Boones will hurt me

02:32.986 --> 02:35.071
if you don't do
exactly what they say--

02:35.113 --> 02:36.865
- No, no, no. Cut. God damn it.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.159
How many times
do I have to tell you

02:39.200 --> 02:40.952
to sound more scared?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.287
- I'm sorry. I am scared.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.372
It's just that I smile
when I'm nervous.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.166
- It's not your smile.
It is your goofy voice.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.917
Can you just say it regular?

02:47.959 --> 02:50.420
- I guess I could try
an American accent.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.755
Give me one second.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.049
Hot dog. Hot dog.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.216
Hot dog.
- All right.

02:55.258 --> 02:59.095
You are scared to death.
Action.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.847
- Craig,
if you're watching this,

03:00.889 --> 03:03.350
I want you to know that I'm--
- That's fucking worse.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.101
Is that the only accent
you got?

03:05.143 --> 03:07.687
- Um, I could do Marge Simpson.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.773
[raspy voice] Hello, Homie.
Would you like--

03:09.814 --> 03:11.941
- Fuck this!

03:11.983 --> 03:14.527
She don't sound scared
'cause she ain't!

03:14.569 --> 03:18.948
Maybe it's time
we escalate this situation.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.241
God damn it!
- [laughs]

03:20.283 --> 03:21.993
- Stop laughing at me!

03:22.035 --> 03:24.704
You know women's laughter
is the sound I hate the most.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.415
I don't think my sister
has conveyed the gravity

03:27.457 --> 03:29.834
of this situation to you, girl.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.420
So I'm just gonna
ask you one question:

03:32.462 --> 03:37.300
Picker, tickler, pinkie,
stretch, or thumb?

03:37.342 --> 03:39.052
- What?
- Which finger do you want me

03:39.094 --> 03:40.220
to cut off--

03:40.261 --> 03:42.514
picker, tickler,

03:42.555 --> 03:45.725
pinkie, stretch, or thumb?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.852
Picker, tickler, pinkie,
stretch, or thumb?

03:47.894 --> 03:51.022
Come on! Picker, tickler,
pinkie, stretch, or thumb?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.483
- Please, I don't want you
to cut off any of my fingers.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.151
- Don't tell me.
Tell the camera. Action!

03:55.193 --> 03:57.779
- Hey, Craig, I'm okay,
but Ray-Nathan has a knife

03:57.821 --> 03:59.364
and I'm pretty sure
he's angry with women.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.574
They said they're not gonna
hurt me if you do everything

04:01.616 --> 04:03.076
that they say, but I'm scared.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.453
I'm really, really scared.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.330
- Nice work, kids.
- I mean, I did it.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.916
- Ray-Nathan dropped his knife.
- Why would you kidnap Jillian?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.376
I'm the only one
that cares about her,

04:11.418 --> 04:12.752
and my net worth
is a minus sign.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.254
- We want our fake jobs back.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.588
- But here's the good news.

04:15.630 --> 04:19.050
Unlike COBRA, I am reasonable.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.302
Rehire us in the next ten days

04:21.344 --> 04:23.388
and nothing happens
to your friend.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.016
After that, let's just say

04:26.057 --> 04:29.102
we won't be the only ones
needin' health insurance.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.854
- Oh, and one more thing.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.314
Before you think about calling
the cops, you might wanna

04:33.356 --> 04:36.985
check on who runs the Port
Everglades sheriff's station--

04:37.027 --> 04:39.112
Tyler Boone.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.197
- No relation,

04:41.239 --> 04:43.324
but a very close friend.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.952
- No relation?
No, relation.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.954
Natalie-Ray,
that's your first cousin.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.247
- Yeah, well,
you could have told me that

04:49.289 --> 04:50.957
before I gave him a hand job
at Nana's funeral.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.667
- Why did you think
he was there?

04:52.709 --> 04:54.794
- Uh, 'cause everyone
loved Nana.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.463
She was a pillar
of our community.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.630
- That's just nasty.
- Yeah, well,

04:57.672 --> 04:59.299
it's not like I got off
or anything.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.717
You all are freaking out
over nothing.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.927
- In a church?
- Uh, yeah.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.971
Hello? God can just forgive it
right away.

05:05.013 --> 05:05.972
- What the fuck?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.099
I wanted this sign
to be jacked.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.476
Does it look jacked to you?

05:09.517 --> 05:11.394
- Yes. It's a really big sign.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.854
- No, this sign
doesn't look jacked.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.148
It looks like it sucks
its own dick on the elliptical.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.025
You're fired.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.026
What about you, big man?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.903
You think
this sign looks jacked?

05:19.944 --> 05:21.571
- I don't know.
Rodney, I actually have

05:21.613 --> 05:22.572
something really serious
to tell you.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.990
- I got an influencer event

05:24.032 --> 05:25.367
happening in eight hours.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.744
More serious than that?
- The Boones took Jillian.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.121
They're gonna hurt her.
- So no, not more serious.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.873
- You have to rehire them.
- Don't do it.

05:31.915 --> 05:32.916
Too expensive.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.709
- Sorry,
she's my little "Rain Man"--

05:34.751 --> 05:37.420
number, number, number, number.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.505
I'm just kidding.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.256
We're a family of Tom Cruises.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.966
- Rodney, please,
I'm begging you.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.968
- I was so proud of you
in San Diego,

05:44.010 --> 05:46.971
lying to all those people
about curing cancer.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.848
I thought my shit clicked
with you, bro.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.642
- Yo, Rodney,
a truck just pulled up.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.602
- Oh, holy shit! It's here?

05:52.644 --> 05:54.145
- Rodney got a shark
for the party tonight.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.772
- Yeah, I'm gonna put it
in the pool and fight it.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.691
- What do you mean, "fight it,"
like bop it on the nose?

05:57.732 --> 05:59.442
- It's a shark.
I'm gonna kill the thing.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.985
- Sounds dangerous.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.862
- I mean, it's a blacktip,
not a great white.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.322
- 'Cause they wouldn't let me
buy a great white

06:04.364 --> 06:06.658
because we are a nation
of girls,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.493
but still a shark,

06:08.535 --> 06:10.787
still a killing machine.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.580
You'll see tonight.
- No, I won't see

06:12.622 --> 06:14.958
because I won't be
at your influencer event.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.502
My friend is kidnapped,
and you won't help.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.004
- Ugh.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.588
Craig, your drama.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.883
All right, where's
that fish I'm gonna murder?

06:23.925 --> 06:25.593
- I'm telling you, man,
you should come to the party,

06:25.635 --> 06:27.387
take your mind off stuff.
- By "stuff," do you mean

06:27.429 --> 06:28.930
my best friend
getting kidnapped?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.473
- Wow.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.891
I thought
I was your best friend.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.060
[laughs] I'm just kidding.
We don't get along.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.895
- [groans]
- Bro, will you relax?

06:35.937 --> 06:37.480
Is anything gonna happen
to Jillian tonight?

06:37.522 --> 06:40.233
- No, but--
- Isaiah, Rodney wants you.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.277
- I'll be right there.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.528
Man, just trust me, okay?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.989
It's like Tyrese says,
"God has a plan."

06:46.031 --> 06:48.324
- Are you seriously
quoting Tyrese to me right now?

06:48.366 --> 06:49.909
- Or Drake
or Floyd Mayweather--

06:49.951 --> 06:52.203
I don't know, they all pretty
much got the same take on God.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.580
- Well, they sent a dud shark.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.665
It's all full of Xanax
or some shit.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.167
It's all sleepy.
Threw a baseball right

06:57.208 --> 06:58.752
at its head.
It just bounced right off.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.170
- The drugs are
for the transport.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.713
It'll wear off soon.
- Yeah, and what if it doesn't?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.923
People are gonna watch me fight
some low-T beta shark?

07:03.965 --> 07:05.508
- You could give it
some of mom's Adderall.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.093
- No. [laughs]

07:07.135 --> 07:08.762
Mama needs that to get out
of bed in the morning

07:08.803 --> 07:10.347
and go to the gym.
Let's think.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.890
Uh, I know.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.059
We get that crate of EpiPens
from the office,

07:14.100 --> 07:15.310
wake that fucker up.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.644
Come on. Let's go.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.563
- Well, looks like you got
a lot on your plate.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.107
I'ma take off.
- Craig, I promise,

07:21.149 --> 07:22.317
there's a plan.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.362
[light percussive music]

07:25.403 --> 07:27.822
- Gabriel, Angel, let's go.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.367
If Rodney won't help,
we'll do this ourselves.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.451
Suit up.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.454
[dramatic music]

07:34.496 --> 07:41.628
* *

07:43.296 --> 07:44.798
- Hold on.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.383
What do we need machetes for?

07:46.424 --> 07:48.051
- Yeah, I thought maybe
I missed a text or something.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.803
- Well, Jillian's
been kidnapped

07:49.844 --> 07:51.388
by that creepy swamp family.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.391
- So the machetes
are for fighting?

07:54.432 --> 07:57.310
- I was hoping we could just
show up and wave 'em around,

07:57.352 --> 07:58.770
look scary.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.689
- But if that doesn't work,
you want us to stab 'em?

08:00.730 --> 08:03.400
- I mean--
- Or cut part of them off?

08:03.441 --> 08:05.527
- I'm not exactly sure how
it's gonna go down, Angel.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.488
- I'm sorry, Mr. Foster,
but I have a family.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.448
I can't be your Batman.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.200
I quit.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.827
- Look...

08:13.868 --> 08:15.620
I get that you're scared.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.455
I'm scared too.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.166
But this is for Jillian.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.836
You love Jillian!
She started Margarita Mondays.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.546
- I hated Margarita Mondays,

08:24.587 --> 08:27.716
but she pays me,
so I couldn't say no.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.177
- Forced fun is not real fun.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.595
- I don't wanna die
for my boss.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.557
- Nah, you guys don't have
to quit.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.350
I'll think of something else.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.269
Sorry for asking.

08:39.310 --> 08:43.815
* *

08:43.857 --> 08:46.818
[phone buzzing]

08:49.154 --> 08:52.115
Hello?
- Hi, it's Brandy from carWOW.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.575
- [sighs]
- I was just calling to see

08:53.616 --> 08:55.076
if you were still in
the market for a used vehicle,

08:55.118 --> 08:57.203
because our fall-forward
sale's event--

08:57.245 --> 08:59.414
- Aah! What the fuck?

08:59.456 --> 09:00.790
- I'm coming down.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.252
- What are you doing here,
Prada,

09:04.294 --> 09:05.795
and why'd you bring
your own chair?

09:05.837 --> 09:08.256
- Because everything in here
obviously has bedbugs.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.550
And I came to help you
save your partner.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.760
- Wait, seriously?

09:11.801 --> 09:12.927
I didn't think
you liked Jillian.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.096
- I don't.
She's got shelter-dog vibes.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.723
- Then why are you gonna
help save her?

09:16.765 --> 09:18.224
- Because in return,

09:18.266 --> 09:21.227
you're going to help me
destroy my father.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.314
* *

09:29.235 --> 09:31.988
- If my dad goes down,
I take over Dominine.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.032
If you help make that happen,

09:34.074 --> 09:36.284
I'll give you your farm back,
free and clear.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.037
- What's the catch?
- The catch is you help me.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.872
I already said the catch.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.248
Jesus, this is gonna be hard.

09:42.290 --> 09:46.628
I feel like I'm explaining
what PDFs are to a cat.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.046
- Don't you like your dad?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.339
You guys have so much
in common.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.924
You're the only two people
I've ever seen

09:50.965 --> 09:52.842
throw lit matches at valets.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.260
- My father taught me
everything I know.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.929
He poured all his knowledge
into me.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.098
But when you finish
a gallon of milk,

09:58.139 --> 10:00.517
you don't leave
the empty carton lying around.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.852
You throw it away.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.062
My time has come.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.147
- Your time? You're 12.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.483
- You only think
that 12 is young

10:08.525 --> 10:10.318
because you're a dinosaur.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.404
What are you, 34?

10:12.445 --> 10:15.073
- Yes, you're really good
at guessing ages.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.282
But why should I trust you?

10:16.324 --> 10:18.326
You've been really, really mean
to me,

10:18.368 --> 10:21.454
which I know sounds childish,
but it's true.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.872
- You should trust me

10:22.914 --> 10:25.458
because I have
the perfect plan,

10:25.500 --> 10:28.795
and because you don't
really have any other options.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.132
Do you?
- [sighs]

10:32.173 --> 10:34.384
Okay.
What do you need me to do?

10:34.426 --> 10:36.553
- My father recently
made five payments

10:36.594 --> 10:39.472
of $1,000,000 each
to a woman named Sophia.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.682
- That's why you mad.

10:40.724 --> 10:41.850
You think
he's having an affair.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.768
- No.
I know he's having an affair.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.437
His mistress bought me
a birthday gift,

10:45.478 --> 10:48.982
but he's spending company funds
on her.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.483
And if we can get proof,

10:50.525 --> 10:52.152
the board will have
to replace him.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.155
- Okay, so how do we get proof?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.239
- I hope you have a nice suit

10:56.281 --> 10:58.283
because you're going
to a party.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.328
- Predator Power party is epic.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.040
There's a freaking shark.
Chomp, chomp, bitches.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.960
- Okay, so I just waited
for sliders behind Seth Green.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.296
Predator Power party is insane.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.466
- Okay. Who's next?
Come on up.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.509
All right,
say "Predator Power."

11:16.551 --> 11:17.844
- Predator Power.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.429
- All right, now say--

11:19.471 --> 11:22.015
- Well, the suit thing
was a mistake.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.725
That's on me.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.102
- What are you doing here?
What happened to Jillian?

11:26.144 --> 11:27.771
- Nothing. It's fine.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.064
I just--

11:29.105 --> 11:31.816
I needed get my mind off
all that drama.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.026
You told me to come.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.195
- Yeah, that's the problem.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.155
It's actually really suspicious
you took my suggestion.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.115
- I told him to come.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.784
He's still employed by us.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.118
And you know what my dad says,

11:42.160 --> 11:45.205
"Time is money,
so time off is stealing."

11:45.246 --> 11:46.331
- Yeah, it just feels
like the Craig I know

11:46.373 --> 11:47.999
would be off saving his friend.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.459
- Maybe you should
worry about the fact

11:49.501 --> 11:52.879
that the predatory hashtag
isn't even trending locally.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.547
Go do your job.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.927
How hard is it to come up
with a reasonable explanation

11:58.968 --> 11:59.969
for why you're here?

12:00.011 --> 12:01.179
Watch this.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.890
I'm a sad farmer
who's never had a quiche.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.184
- I've had a quiche,
Prada Lamonca.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.104
- Shh! I don't wanna be seen
talking to you.

12:09.145 --> 12:14.234
Wait 15 seconds,
then meet me at the buffet.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.695
- One Mississippi,
two Mississippi...

12:19.280 --> 12:21.032
- That was only 12 seconds.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.076
- Nuh-uh,
I used the Mississippi method.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.452
One Mississippi--
- Shh!

12:24.494 --> 12:26.830
Don't look at me.
Just stare straight forward

12:26.871 --> 12:28.540
and pile your plate.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.376
Do you know what
you're supposed to do?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.294
- Yeah, you made me
go over it 1,000 times.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.171
- Well, my confidence
in you was shaken

12:35.213 --> 12:36.756
after the whole suit debacle.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.258
- Okay.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.884
So as soon as it gets dark,

12:39.926 --> 12:42.178
Rodney is gonna make
his big announcement.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.431
[air horn blares]
- Ladies, gentlemen,

12:44.472 --> 12:46.766
and Predators, thank y'all
so much for coming.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.477
I stole a saw palmetto farm
from this dude Craig,

12:49.519 --> 12:51.980
and now I'm gonna go fight
a shark for no real reason.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.566
Yada, yada, yada.
I'm a dream killer.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.443
[cheers and applause]

12:56.484 --> 12:58.695
- That's not what
he's gonna say.

12:58.737 --> 12:59.904
- I was paraphrasing.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.781
- Do you wanna
save your friend or not?

13:01.823 --> 13:04.993
- Fine, so as Rodney's giving
his electrifying,

13:05.035 --> 13:06.745
logical introduction,

13:06.786 --> 13:08.705
I sneak
into the downstairs bathroom,

13:08.747 --> 13:11.750
second door past the kitchen,
and hide.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.709
Wouldn't it make more sense

13:12.751 --> 13:14.085
for you to hide
in the bathroom?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.837
I feel like you're a lot
less conspicuous than I am.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.172
- I'm very conspicuous.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.548
I have presence.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.176
Also, I have my sober companion
watching over me

13:21.217 --> 13:22.844
at all times.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.305
Hi, Meryl.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.974
[scoffs] Why don't people
in recovery wear makeup?

13:28.016 --> 13:29.976
- Aren't you a little young
to have a sober companion?

13:30.018 --> 13:31.436
Is everything okay?
- I had a period

13:31.478 --> 13:33.605
of youthful rebellion
when I was ten.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.482
I'm past it. Keep going.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.942
- Okay, so Rodney comes in
to change.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.319
- Now it's time
to kill an animal

13:39.361 --> 13:41.071
like a fucking psychopath!

13:41.112 --> 13:42.405
- Craig.
- I can imagine your dad

13:42.447 --> 13:43.490
calling himself a psychopath.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.824
I bet he thinks that's cool.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.451
Anyway, he leaves his phone
in there.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.952
- Which phone?
- Both of them,

13:47.994 --> 13:49.954
his regular phone,
and the secret burner

13:49.996 --> 13:51.331
he uses for illegal shit.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.375
Then he locks the door

13:53.416 --> 13:55.293
and gives the key to Isaiah
for safekeeping.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.213
- Hold on to this.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.215
- Then while he's off
murdering a shark--

14:00.256 --> 14:02.092
- Grow up.
It's not murder.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.385
If the shark attacks first,

14:03.426 --> 14:04.719
he's allowed
to stand his ground.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.054
This is Florida.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.515
- Okay, so while your dad's off
defending himself

14:08.556 --> 14:10.725
against a shark aggressor,

14:10.767 --> 14:14.270
I'll use the dongle
you gave me to copy his phone.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.272
It'll take 14 minutes,
which we have

14:16.314 --> 14:18.149
because even
if the fight ends early,

14:18.191 --> 14:19.693
Rodney still has
to pose for pictures

14:19.734 --> 14:22.487
as some kind of activation
for the influencers.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.447
- Say "I'm a predator"
on three.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.367
One, two, three.
all: I'm a predator!

14:27.409 --> 14:29.369
- I leave,
lock the door behind me,

14:29.411 --> 14:30.704
and give you back the dongle.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.872
Did I get
that very simple plan right,

14:32.914 --> 14:34.082
Prada Lamonca?

14:34.124 --> 14:36.418
- Jesus, how much food
did you take?

14:36.459 --> 14:37.919
- It was a long plan.
I had to stall.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.213
- Well, throw it away,

14:40.255 --> 14:41.506
and make sure
you're in the bathroom

14:41.548 --> 14:43.842
by the time my dad
finishes his announcement.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.056
- Fucking Prada Lamonca.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.100
Fucking portion police.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.811
I'm eating this crab rangoon.
Fuck you.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.604
- Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.606
Oh, holy shit.

14:58.648 --> 14:59.774
- Brock,
what you doing here, man?

14:59.816 --> 15:02.402
- Oh, where the fuck else
would I be, huh?

15:02.444 --> 15:04.904
It's only the influencer event
of the season.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.740
Brother,
I am just surfing trends

15:06.781 --> 15:08.783
and riding the waves
where they take me.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.118
Let's get you a drink, huh?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.578
Come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.788
- Yeah, gotta get you involved
here.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.708
Maybe later we go smoke
a cigarette and touch tips.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.837
Then I fucking worked
with those two ladies

15:20.879 --> 15:23.923
who talk to each other,
which only led to more growth.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.593
I mean, collabs beget collabs.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.220
Anyway, guess how many
subscribers I have.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.180
Let me give you a hint.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.057
It rhymes with a million.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.641
- A billion.
- Half a million!

15:33.683 --> 15:35.602
[laughs]
- It's the same word.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.104
It's not a rhyme--
- Half a million people.

15:38.146 --> 15:41.107
Half a million people care
what I have to say about life,

15:41.149 --> 15:42.692
love, not race.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.778
That was a mistake.
I took that video down.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.196
- Nice, well, it sounds like
everything's going good

15:46.237 --> 15:47.655
for you, buddy.
- Hey, hey, hey.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.449
You know what people ask me
about all the time?

15:49.491 --> 15:51.910
That video where I gave you
and Jillian 20k.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.036
Yeah, did huge numbers.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.913
What do you say
we do a funny follow-up,

15:54.954 --> 15:59.459
where, uh, I don't know,
maybe, uh, you pay me back?

15:59.501 --> 16:00.627
- Well, I don't have
that cash anymore.

16:00.669 --> 16:01.711
- All right, fine.
Then fuck it.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.004
We'll do something else.
We'll fuckin'

16:03.046 --> 16:04.506
shoot it right here.
- I'm not shooting a video

16:04.547 --> 16:05.965
with you.
I'm here for work.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.176
And I gotta go.
Good luck with everything.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.178
- Craig,

16:10.220 --> 16:11.930
I need this.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.515
Okay?

16:13.556 --> 16:17.185
Do you remember when I told
you that shit was awesome?

16:17.227 --> 16:19.646
- Ten seconds ago.
- That was a fuckin' lie.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.564
Shit is very much not awesome.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.650
I mean, Corby went off
to college

16:23.692 --> 16:25.777
like a fucking show-off,
and my wife left me.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.112
- What about
all your followers?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.405
- I need content.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.698
I mean,
they're fucking insatiable.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.658
How much content
can one man make?

16:31.700 --> 16:35.078
I'm like a--
like a moldy old grapefruit,

16:35.120 --> 16:37.372
and they're just
juicing me dry.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.499
- Okay.
- I had one video

16:39.541 --> 16:41.459
that got some traction,
where I shot a bottle rocket

16:41.501 --> 16:44.671
out of my eye socket,
so I leaned into that gimmick.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.339
Guess what fucking happened
next.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.758
- Burned your face really bad?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.635
- No! Well, yes,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.346
but I rebranded myself
Socket Man.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.015
I came up
with a killer theme song,

16:55.056 --> 16:57.475
and then fucking Elton John's
label sued me.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.060
Now all my God damn money
goes to the lawyers.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.771
[air horn blaring]

17:01.813 --> 17:04.649
- Ladies, gentleman
and Predators,

17:04.691 --> 17:06.901
thank you all so much
for coming.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.903
Tonight's all about--
- Well, thank you

17:08.945 --> 17:11.322
for that deeply depressing
download, Brock,

17:11.364 --> 17:12.657
but I really gotta go.
- Hey, hey, hey.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.451
I didn't even get invited
to this party.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.036
I lied and said
I was Jake Paul's uncle

17:16.077 --> 17:18.163
who does funny pornos.
- You think I'm doing well?

17:18.204 --> 17:20.040
I'm working for Rodney Lamonca.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.583
I can't help you.
- Craig, please?

17:21.624 --> 17:23.543
- I'm sorry, Brock. I gotta go.
- God damn it.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.628
Come on. Get--
[mumbles angrily]

17:25.670 --> 17:28.048
That slippery motherfucker!
Fuck!

17:28.089 --> 17:31.051
[tense music]

17:31.092 --> 17:37.974
* *

17:39.976 --> 17:42.937
[phone buzzing]

17:45.607 --> 17:47.150
- Jillian, are you okay?

17:47.192 --> 17:48.860
- Um, still kidnapped.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.779
Just calling because
the Boones hadn't heard

17:50.820 --> 17:52.572
from you, and they want me
to remind you

17:52.614 --> 17:54.115
what will happen to me
if you don't get them

17:54.157 --> 17:55.575
their insurance back.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.410
- I know. I'm trying.
- They'll cut off my pinker.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.536
- Your picker!

17:58.578 --> 18:00.163
Pinker isn't one
of the options.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.456
- She's thinking of pinkie.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.999
- Well, I don't wanna lose
either of them.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.460
- Jillian, I really gotta go,
but I have a plan.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.419
It's all gonna to be okay.
- Thanks, Cra--

18:06.461 --> 18:07.712
[door clicks open]

18:11.925 --> 18:13.677
- I'm not trying
to be mean, Meryl,

18:13.718 --> 18:16.471
but a lash would go a long way.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.557
- Fuck you.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.017
- Prada.
- Isaiah.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.560
- You're spending a lot
of time with my brother.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.022
- You're spending a lot
of time with my dad.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.607
- Hold on to this.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.612
Hey, who wants to see me
kill a shark

18:32.654 --> 18:34.531
like a fucking psychopath, huh?

18:34.572 --> 18:37.117
[cheers and applause]

18:37.158 --> 18:44.040
* *

18:56.094 --> 18:57.595
[phone chimes]

18:57.637 --> 19:00.598
[cheers and applause]

19:00.640 --> 19:02.726
[suspenseful music]

19:02.767 --> 19:05.145
[chanting]
Predator! Predator!

19:05.186 --> 19:07.355
Predator! Predator!

19:07.397 --> 19:10.316
[cheers and applause]

19:10.358 --> 19:17.532
* *

19:19.075 --> 19:20.660
[crowd gasps]

19:20.702 --> 19:22.287
[crowd whispers concernedly]

19:22.328 --> 19:25.290
[crowd screaming]

19:25.331 --> 19:31.004
* *

19:31.046 --> 19:32.547
- [screaming]

19:39.471 --> 19:42.015
- This is so messed up.
Rodney Lamonca might die.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.725
[cries] I don't know
a lot about him,

19:43.767 --> 19:46.019
but I do know
that he has a mom.

19:46.061 --> 19:49.230
And as a mom myself, it's just
really emotional, you know?

19:49.272 --> 19:50.648
[crowd yelling]

19:50.690 --> 19:52.692
- Oh, this is bad!

19:52.734 --> 19:55.570
You guys, this is really bad.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.988
- Thanks
for sending the hearts.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.698
I love you guys.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.659
[suspenseful music]

20:01.701 --> 20:05.538
[screaming]

20:05.580 --> 20:09.459
[panicked screaming]

20:09.501 --> 20:10.919
- What the fuck's going on?

20:12.629 --> 20:14.422
- Is there a doctor?
Is anyone a doctor?

20:14.464 --> 20:16.049
- What happened?

20:16.091 --> 20:18.301
- The shark ate him.
The shark ate Rodney!

20:18.343 --> 20:19.636
Is anyone a doctor here?

20:19.678 --> 20:21.513
- I'm a pimple popper!
- I review lotions.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.181
- Let's go! Come on!

20:23.223 --> 20:24.808
- Is he dead?

20:24.849 --> 20:26.935
- What are you doing in there?

20:26.976 --> 20:28.478
- Everyone was screaming.
I got lost.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.313
- Wasn't that door locked?
- No.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.731
I don't know. Who cares?

20:31.773 --> 20:33.358
Is Rodney dead?
- He's fuckin' fine.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.734
- Fine? A shark ate him.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.569
What are you talking about?

20:36.611 --> 20:37.696
- [sighs] Motherfucker.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.197
[dramatic musical sting]

20:39.239 --> 20:40.740
- What the fuck?

20:40.782 --> 20:42.242
You're okay?
You weren't in the pool?

20:42.283 --> 20:43.451
- Of course I wasn't
in the fucking pool.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.953
You think I'd get
in the water with a shark?

20:44.994 --> 20:47.080
- I mean, yes, you've been
bragging about it all day.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.248
- Well, you didn't listen
close enough.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.500
I said someone
is gonna fight the shark.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.586
- You said, "Where's the fish
I'm gonna murder?"

20:53.628 --> 20:54.921
- So I tricked you. [laughs]

20:54.963 --> 20:56.339
- I don't understand.
Who got eaten?

20:56.381 --> 20:58.591
- Stunt double.
We got the idea from Pitbull.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.051
- Well, how did
this even happen?

21:00.093 --> 21:01.886
I thought we're supposed
to get some dinky Muppet shark.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.054
- That you shot full
of EpiPens.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.973
- No. No. This is not on me.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.600
That legless fuck out there
said he could fight a shark.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.102
If he couldn't do the job,

21:09.144 --> 21:10.937
he shouldn't have taken
the 300 bucks.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.439
- That's all he got?
- Yeah, for, like,

21:12.480 --> 21:13.732
five minutes of work.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.942
Expand that out
to eight hours a day,

21:15.984 --> 21:18.653
five days a week,
52 weeks a year, that's--

21:18.695 --> 21:20.947
Prada, what is that?
- 7.48 million.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.241
- I'm so sorry
that I hired a guy

21:23.283 --> 21:25.952
for 7.48 million dollars
a year.

21:25.994 --> 21:28.121
Now can we just focus up here?

21:28.163 --> 21:30.623
I'm gonna look like
a giant pussy if I go out there

21:30.665 --> 21:32.250
and admit
that I faked the shark bite.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.961
But if I do pretend
that I was in the pool,

21:35.003 --> 21:37.714
people are gonna ask,
"Why does he still have legs?"

21:37.756 --> 21:40.300
Solutions, go!

21:40.342 --> 21:42.635
Come on.
Use your brain, rapid-fire.

21:42.677 --> 21:43.887
Let's go. Think, think, think.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.221
First thing
that comes out of your head.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.890
- Stairs.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.267
- Stairs? You fucking dumb?

21:49.309 --> 21:51.644
- That was the first thing
that came to my mind.

21:51.686 --> 21:54.689
- You know, I'm just gonna fix
this myself, as usual.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.108
Behold!
- [gasps]

21:57.150 --> 22:01.571
- I rise like Jesus Christ.

22:01.613 --> 22:05.992
From the blood in the water,
I stand before you,

22:06.034 --> 22:09.704
and that is the regenerative
power of Predator Pills,

22:09.746 --> 22:11.206
ladies and gentlemen.

22:11.247 --> 22:14.209
[uneasy music]

22:14.250 --> 22:15.919
* *

22:15.960 --> 22:18.421
I did it to prove a point.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.006
It was a stunt,

22:20.048 --> 22:22.967
and the fake me
is gonna be fine.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.594
- [moaning]
I'm gonna be okay.

22:24.636 --> 22:25.929
Don't leave me, okay?

22:25.970 --> 22:27.222
- Well, that fucking ruled.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.015
They ate that shit up.
You see their snouts?

22:29.057 --> 22:30.767
They're wet with drool.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.310
All right, let's bounce.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.561
Where's my phone?

22:33.603 --> 22:35.313
- Right there.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.023
- No, my other phone.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.192
They're both in the bathroom.
I have a secret phone

22:39.234 --> 22:40.568
with important shit on it.
- There was only one phone

22:40.610 --> 22:43.071
in the bathroom,
right, Craig?

22:43.113 --> 22:44.948
- Yeah.
Yeah, that was the only one.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.659
- Someone took it.
I cannot lose my secret phone.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.828
Activate the Omega Protocols.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.622
- The what?
- The--Jesus fucking Christ!

22:52.664 --> 22:54.040
It's like I'm talking
to a baby.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.458
The Omega Protocols!

22:55.500 --> 22:58.294
Lock down this party
right the fuck now!

23:01.256 --> 23:03.967
Listen up! Party's over!
Come here.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.261
No one gets out of here
without gettin' searched.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.555
You got that?
- Let's go! Form a line!

23:08.596 --> 23:10.849
Step up. Arms up.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.227
- Welcome to Omega Protocols,
motherfuckers!

23:14.269 --> 23:15.395
- Step up.
- Why didn't you

23:15.437 --> 23:17.230
pocket the phone?
- Everyone was screaming.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.314
I didn't know
what was happening.

23:18.356 --> 23:19.858
- You didn't just assume
the stunt guy

23:19.899 --> 23:21.151
got eaten by the shark?

23:21.192 --> 23:23.278
- No, I did not assume that,
Prada Lamonca.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.238
But listen,
it finished copying.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.448
Let's just put the phone back

23:26.489 --> 23:28.033
and say we found it
on the ground.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.743
- You think he's gonna fall
for that?

23:29.784 --> 23:31.244
Are you calling my dad stupid?

23:31.286 --> 23:32.912
- Why are you insulted?
You trying to destroy him.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.497
- To prove myself.

23:34.539 --> 23:35.665
To win his love.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.417
Dump the phone
in the houseplant

23:37.459 --> 23:39.002
and sneak the dongle out.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.921
- How?
They have metal detectors.

23:41.963 --> 23:45.675
Prada! Prada!

23:45.717 --> 23:47.927
[metal detector beeping]

23:49.888 --> 23:51.931
Brock?

23:51.973 --> 23:54.225
Hey, crazy what happened,
right?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.102
Did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

23:56.144 --> 23:58.438
Went over there to help 'cause
I'm a wild animal expert.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.732
I'm the one that said,
"Shark ate this guy's legs."

24:00.774 --> 24:04.486
- Well, I need your help,
not a big deal, tiny favor.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.238
I was hoping you could stick
something in your eye socket.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.907
I'll do the video with you.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.159
- Here's my counteroffer.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.121
Go fuck yourself.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.540
- Brock, please, we're friends.
- We are not friends.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.959
You just wanna get in my socket
like all the rest.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.379
- The rest of who?
- I gave you 20k.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.130
You couldn't give me
five minutes.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.715
Why the fuck would I help you?

24:25.757 --> 24:27.967
- Jillian is in danger.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.803
- What the hell
are you talking about?

24:29.844 --> 24:31.137
- So we started our farm.

24:31.179 --> 24:32.764
Then there were these snails.

24:32.806 --> 24:34.140
Then I had to make a side deal

24:34.182 --> 24:36.309
with these crazy swamp
criminals to survive.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.478
Then Isaiah screwed me over
and sold me out to Rodney.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.689
- God damn, you getting
fucked in every hole.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.190
- You have no idea.

24:42.232 --> 24:44.693
The second our business
got even a tiny bit of success,

24:44.734 --> 24:46.736
people showed up
trying to take it.

24:46.778 --> 24:49.823
All these... predators,

24:49.864 --> 24:51.491
fighting over my carcass,

24:51.533 --> 24:54.202
ripping me to shreds.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.329
- All right, yeah. Fuck it.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.748
I'll help.
- Oh, my God.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.291
Thank you, Brock.
- In exchange

25:00.333 --> 25:02.252
for part ownership
of your farm.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.336
- What?
- You gave

25:03.378 --> 25:04.921
a very effective little speech.

25:04.963 --> 25:07.549
Gave me an idea.
People are predators.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.009
I need to be a predator.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.593
- That wasn't supposed
to be your takeaway.

25:10.635 --> 25:13.179
- Well, it was. 5%.

25:13.221 --> 25:16.057
Are you in, or are you out?

25:16.099 --> 25:22.105
* *

25:22.147 --> 25:24.274
- Hey, not to be a backseat
driver, but I think

25:24.315 --> 25:26.151
the dongle's sticking out
of your socket a little.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.111
- Oh, come on.
No one's gonna notice that.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.738
People been trained
their whole life to look away

25:29.779 --> 25:31.239
from those with disabilities.

25:31.281 --> 25:34.492
I remind them of their frailty,
so they just ignore me.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.786
Pretty much get away
with anything.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.413
It fucking rules. [laughs]

25:38.455 --> 25:40.040
- Does it hurt having stuff
up there?

25:40.081 --> 25:41.207
- Mm, not really.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.376
I mean, I get dizzy
from time to time

25:43.418 --> 25:45.211
and my spine hurts
if I push it into far.

25:45.253 --> 25:47.005
I can't form any
short-term memories.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.340
Big deal.
- Arms up.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.924
- It's okay. I work for Rodney.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.217
- There's no one I trust less

25:51.259 --> 25:52.344
than the people
who work for me.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.720
Wand him.

25:53.762 --> 25:56.765
[metal detector whirring]

25:56.806 --> 25:58.350
- He's clear.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.601
- Hey, thanks for the party,
Rodney.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.227
It was memorable.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.897
- There he is, huh,
the fucking legend.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.440
- Check the patch.

26:05.482 --> 26:06.733
- Oh, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:06.775 --> 26:08.401
I don't want that cancer stick
up near my brain.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.528
- All right, then lift it up.

26:10.570 --> 26:13.239
Let's see that hole.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.866
- All right, well,
as long as you don't mind

26:14.908 --> 26:16.076
being grossed out.
- The only thing

26:16.117 --> 26:18.119
that grosses me out
is a pregnant woman.

26:20.121 --> 26:22.165
Fucking placenta,

26:22.207 --> 26:23.375
fuck that shit.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.668
Lift it.

26:24.709 --> 26:27.629

26:27.671 --> 26:31.257

26:31.299 --> 26:34.302
He's good.
- All right.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.596
Thanks for the party.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.306
- That was gross.

26:40.725 --> 26:43.853
- [laughs] Ho, ho, ho, yeah.
- Whoa.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.438
Holy shit, Brock...
- Yeah.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.148
- That was
some David Blaine shit.

26:47.190 --> 26:48.066
- Mm-hmm.
- Where'd you hide the dongle?

26:48.108 --> 26:49.401
Did you palm it?

26:49.442 --> 26:50.860
- Nah, just shoved it deeper
in the socket

26:50.902 --> 26:52.070
when I took the patch off.

26:52.112 --> 26:54.114
- Oh, deep-socketed it. Damn.
- Yeah.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.699
- You good?

26:55.740 --> 26:56.741
- No problem.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.034
Nat-wah.

26:58.076 --> 26:59.577
- Huh?

26:59.619 --> 27:02.706
- Yeah, just--
yeah, just having a little, uh,

27:02.747 --> 27:05.500
a little balance--
a little balance thing here.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.836
Just might have shoved it
in there a little too deep.

27:07.877 --> 27:11.798
[groans] Oh, shit!

27:11.840 --> 27:16.803
- Brock? Brock?

27:16.845 --> 27:19.931
Brock! Brock!

27:19.973 --> 27:24.060

27:24.102 --> 27:25.645
- He just woke up.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.272
His vitals look good.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.648
We think
he's gonna be all right.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.316
- Except the doctor
made me promise

27:30.358 --> 27:32.902
to stop sticking stuff
in the socket.

27:32.944 --> 27:35.613
- Good, I've been telling you
that for the last year, Dad.

27:35.655 --> 27:37.282
- And you're not a doctor,
Corby.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.243
You're a fuckin' child
majoring in sports management.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.828
Look, it doesn't matter
if this is the end

27:41.870 --> 27:43.913
of my YouTube career

27:43.955 --> 27:45.707
'cause I'm a farmer now.

27:50.086 --> 27:51.296
- Nurse, I think
he's having a stroke.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.965
- No, no, no.
I'm winkin' at you.

27:54.007 --> 27:55.133
- Well, I don't even have
the farm

27:55.175 --> 27:56.843
until we get that dongle
to Prada Lamonca.

27:56.885 --> 27:58.887
Speaking of which,
what happened to the thing

27:58.928 --> 28:00.347
that was stuck in his socket?

28:00.388 --> 28:01.848
- Oh, I gave it
to his old neurologist.

28:01.890 --> 28:03.767
He came by to check on him.
- Neurologist?

28:03.808 --> 28:05.935
I don't have a neurologist.
- Yes, you do.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.812
He was just here, Dr. Todd.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.230
- Who the fuck is Dr. Todd?

28:09.272 --> 28:12.108

28:12.150 --> 28:13.860
- Oh, shit!
