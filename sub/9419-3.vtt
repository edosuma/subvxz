01:13.841 --> 01:15.107
Comments, some of them

You know?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.396
>> this is old news, yeah.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.430
>> I don't really care to talk

06:05.432 --> 06:06.431
To anyone here.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.332
>> when you think about t-lights

06:07.334 --> 06:07.999
And you think about

06:08.001 --> 06:09.601
The possibility of meeting him,

06:09.603 --> 06:10.902
What's sort of your dream

06:13.507 --> 06:14.339
And I want to live by the beach.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.141
And he grew up there.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.909
So maybe I would, like,

06:17.911 --> 06:19.077
Move there and then,

06:19.079 --> 06:19.911
Potentially, like,

06:19.913 --> 06:21.279
Live together if we keep

06:21.281 --> 06:21.947
Getting, like, closer

06:21.949 --> 06:23.281
And closer on that level.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.549
>> do you feel like

06:24.551 --> 06:25.450
You love him?

06:25.452 --> 06:26.918
>> we, like, you know--

06:26.920 --> 06:28.520
We don't say, like, "I love you"

06:28.522 --> 06:29.254
Because I'm gonna, like,

06:29.256 --> 06:29.921
Guard my heart.

06:29.923 --> 06:30.989
Like, I'm not just gonna say

06:30.991 --> 06:32.157
That when I haven't met

06:32.159 --> 06:32.824
The person.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.025
He, like, tells me that he

06:34.027 --> 06:35.160
Trusts me, which, like,

06:35.162 --> 06:35.894
Means a lot.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.896
I don't trust a lot of people,

06:37.898 --> 06:38.797
So that's attractive

06:38.799 --> 06:40.866
When guys are like that.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.602
I have a voicemail,

06:43.604 --> 06:45.036
If y'all want to hear his voice.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.238
>> yeah. I'd like to.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.072
I'll--we'll swing around

06:47.074 --> 06:49.141
A little bit.

06:49.143 --> 07:00.185
>> at what point did you guys

07:00.187 --> 07:01.620
Exchange cell phone numbers?

07:01.622 --> 07:02.287
>> he asked me for my kik

07:02.289 --> 07:02.954
So we didn't have to

07:02.956 --> 07:03.922
Put our numbers on instagram.

07:03.924 --> 07:04.923
And then he kiked me,

07:04.925 --> 07:05.891
And we exchanged numbers there.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.225
>> but instagram's public,

07:07.227 --> 07:08.126
So someone could have seen

07:08.128 --> 07:09.795
That this guy spoke to you on

07:09.797 --> 07:11.930
Instagram, and then impersonated

07:11.932 --> 07:12.931
Him on kik.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.266
>> that's a stretch, but sure.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.734
>> we've seen that before.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.102
>> let's just go to his

07:17.104 --> 07:19.171
Instagram.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.206
Wow, okay.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.707
Cute guy.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.508
He says, "I sing in the

07:23.510 --> 07:24.943
Twentys," which is his group.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.411
>> he has almost 30,000

07:26.413 --> 07:27.913
Followers.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.314
He's insta-famous.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.182
>> there you go.

07:30.184 --> 07:30.916
>> uh-oh.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.217
>> nothing crazy.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.718
He's kind of like a more manly

07:33.720 --> 07:35.153
Version of justin bieber.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.221
>> they have a brand-new

07:36.223 --> 07:36.888
Music video.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.556
>> yeah.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.157
That's one of their newest ones.

07:39.159 --> 07:39.825
>> ♪ I said, baby

07:39.827 --> 07:41.393
♪ what's good? ♪

07:41.395 --> 07:43.462
♪ I know it's kind of fun ♪

07:43.464 --> 07:44.963
>> which one is he?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.097
>> he's on the left.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.834
Gabi's on the right.

07:48.836 --> 07:49.701
>> this is, like,

07:49.703 --> 07:50.936
A pretty legit video.

07:50.938 --> 07:51.603
>> yeah.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.270
>> and what's this

07:52.272 --> 07:53.038
Techno Tuesday?

07:53.040 --> 07:53.738
>> I think it's at, like,

07:53.740 --> 07:54.406
A club they do.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.440
>> wait. On December 17th.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.374
What day is today?

07:56.376 --> 07:57.843
>> the 15th, I think.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.811
>> holy smokes.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.812
We got to go.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.813
>> I know. I noticed that.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.481
>> we should go.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.315
>> I know.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.449
He's been talking about it to me

08:04.451 --> 08:05.317
On text messages.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.352
>> this guy seems to have

08:07.354 --> 08:08.553
A lot going on.

08:08.555 --> 08:09.488
>> yeah.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.422
>> so what are the things

08:10.424 --> 08:11.423
That don't add up?

08:11.425 --> 08:12.491
>> in the very beginning,

08:12.493 --> 08:13.792
I've asked him to facetime,

08:13.794 --> 08:14.626
But that was, like, literally

08:14.628 --> 08:16.161
The first, like, week or two

08:16.163 --> 08:17.362
That we started, like, texting.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.430
He said he was, like, doing

08:18.432 --> 08:19.164
Something in the studio,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.699
Which is usually what he says.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.500
"I'm in the studio."

08:21.502 --> 08:22.234
That's always his biggest

08:22.236 --> 08:23.702
Excuse for different things.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.870
It still stresses me out,

08:24.872 --> 08:26.137
Like, all the time.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.706
Oh, this is another thing

08:27.708 --> 08:28.840
That was kind of weird to me

08:28.842 --> 08:30.108
That was bothering me also.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.309
He'll be lurking on me on

08:31.311 --> 08:32.777
Instagram, and he'll randomly

08:32.779 --> 08:33.578
Take a screenshot and send it

08:33.580 --> 08:34.246
To me.

08:34.248 --> 08:35.113
And he'll be like, "you'll be,

08:35.115 --> 08:36.014
Like, so perfect, bae."

08:36.015 --> 08:36.681
Or something.

08:36.683 --> 08:37.749
Like, he'll send that

08:37.751 --> 08:38.817
At random times.

08:38.818 --> 08:39.985
>> that is weird,

08:39.986 --> 08:41.553
To take screen grabs

08:41.554 --> 08:42.953
And send them back.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.222
Something's not adding up.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.557
>> there is positive things that

08:45.559 --> 08:47.158
Make me believe he is who he is,

08:47.160 --> 08:48.260
But there's stuff that's, like,

08:48.262 --> 08:49.928
Sketchy that bothers me and that

08:49.930 --> 08:50.896
I think about all the time.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.265
So there's obviously doubts.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.767
>> is what you want to have us

08:55.769 --> 08:57.035
Help you go and meet him?

08:57.037 --> 08:57.969
Or is what you want just to--

08:57.971 --> 08:58.637
>> yes.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.304
Because I would, like,

08:59.306 --> 09:00.739
Never go by myself to do it.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.173
I feel like this is the biggest

09:02.175 --> 09:03.008
Support system that you could

09:03.010 --> 09:03.708
Have.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.809
And, like, I cannot do something

09:04.811 --> 09:05.677
Like that by myself.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.745
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't

09:06.747 --> 09:08.179
'cause I'm just smart enough

09:08.181 --> 09:09.681
To know that that's ridiculous

09:09.683 --> 09:11.283
And too dangerous.

09:11.285 --> 09:12.884
>> are you ready to deal with

09:12.886 --> 09:16.655
What could be some bad news?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.490
>> I'm prepared to get answers.

09:18.492 --> 09:19.991
>> well, then we've got a lot

09:19.993 --> 09:22.127
Of work to do.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.195
Investigation time.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.431
We're gonna go.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.098
>> okay.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.033
We're gonna get straight to

09:28.035 --> 09:29.200
Work.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.235
Hopefully, we'll figure this

09:30.237 --> 09:31.670
Out, and we'll get you answers.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.337
All right.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.004
>> thank you.

09:33.006 --> 09:33.672
>> bye.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.140
>> bye.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.041
>> all right, nev.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.409
That's kind of a new one.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.143
>> this is interesting.

09:38.145 --> 09:38.810
>> yeah.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.744
>> she's skeptical.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.413
Like, she's protecting herself,

09:41.415 --> 09:42.113
And she's looking for--

09:42.115 --> 09:43.949
>> she's pretty, like, on it.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.883
>> totally.

09:44.885 --> 09:45.917
>> I mean, she's observant.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.252
She's looking for things

09:47.254 --> 09:47.919
That look weird.

09:47.921 --> 09:48.587
>> yeah.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.255
The big sort of weird thing,

09:50.257 --> 09:52.123
Though, is if I was that guy,

09:52.125 --> 09:54.426
And I had this very beautiful

09:54.428 --> 09:55.660
Girl who I had been talking to

09:55.662 --> 09:56.695
For years interested in me...

09:56.697 --> 09:57.529
>> yeah.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.097
>> I would want to see her.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.166
So what is he hiding?

10:01.168 --> 10:07.939
>> max, close your eyes.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.673
Do you trust me?

10:08.675 --> 10:09.574
>> yes.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.976
>> so if I say, bend your knees

10:10.978 --> 10:12.410
And sit back, do you trust that

10:12.412 --> 10:13.545
There's a chair there for you?

10:13.547 --> 10:14.212
>> yeah.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.313
>> all right, sit down.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.681
No, you can't do that.

10:16.683 --> 10:17.616
You can't feel.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.650
That's the trust.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.551
Do it, buddy.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.519
Yeah!

10:21.521 --> 10:23.588
>> I guess I can trust you.

10:23.590 --> 10:26.925
>> so basically what we've got

10:26.927 --> 10:27.759
Is a girl who really likes

10:27.761 --> 10:29.394
This guy t-lights.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.896
But she's being careful because

10:31.898 --> 10:33.231
She knows she's never met him.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.368
She has no hard evidence that

10:36.370 --> 10:37.802
He is exactly who he says he is

10:37.804 --> 10:40.105
On his instagram and on youtube,

10:40.107 --> 10:40.905
And on all these different

10:40.907 --> 10:41.973
Platforms.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.442
He seems very able to post

10:44.444 --> 10:46.978
And share video content.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.847
And yet, he's never once

10:48.849 --> 10:50.548
Sent a little three-second video

10:50.550 --> 10:51.583
Or 10-second video

10:51.585 --> 10:52.617
Of him playing the guitar.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.952
>> why doesn't he post anything

10:53.954 --> 10:55.320
That's directed at her?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.755
>> something's going on.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.456
>> so where do we even start?

10:58.458 --> 10:59.758
>> here's his twitter.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.327
His real name is albert ambrose.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.995
>> he's got his soundcloud

11:03.997 --> 11:04.763
Listed.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.098
>> 8,700 followers.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.566
>> that's an interesting

11:08.568 --> 11:10.635
Picture.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.004
>> and then he's got

11:13.006 --> 11:14.272
An instagram.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.974
>> this is the instagram page

11:15.976 --> 11:17.342
For the band, the twentys.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.243
>> and they have a lot

11:18.245 --> 11:19.344
Of followers.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.545
>> so all of these accounts

11:20.547 --> 11:22.614
Reference each other.

11:22.616 --> 11:26.685
He's practicing.

11:26.687 --> 11:27.485
>> ♪ say the [bleep]

11:27.487 --> 11:28.787
♪ that you said

11:28.789 --> 11:30.488
What?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.090
>> his saying "what" sounded

11:32.092 --> 11:33.358
A lot like antoinette's

11:33.360 --> 11:34.659
Voicemail.

11:34.661 --> 11:37.462
Go to their soundcloud.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.364
Boca raton, florida.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.232
And that's him in the front.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.168
>> what seemed to be a big red

11:43.170 --> 11:44.903
Flag--oh, he's a rap artist

11:44.905 --> 11:46.404
Musician--it's very

11:46.406 --> 11:47.272
Realistically sort of

11:47.274 --> 11:48.540
Small and modest,

11:48.542 --> 11:49.974
And they're doing local gigs.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.209
>> but we need to know that this

11:51.211 --> 11:53.344
Guy from this group is actually

11:53.346 --> 11:55.747
The guy that's talking to her.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.415
How do we prove that?

11:57.417 --> 11:58.883
>> the only thing that we have

11:58.885 --> 12:00.885
For him is a phone number.

12:00.887 --> 12:01.886
>> we know that she's been

12:01.888 --> 12:02.887
Talking to him on the phone,

12:02.889 --> 12:03.988
So we know that that number

12:03.990 --> 12:05.390
Belongs to whoever she's been

12:05.392 --> 12:06.224
Talking to.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.460
Let's run it.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.527
What are we going to get?

12:09.529 --> 12:10.495
[sighs]

12:10.497 --> 12:11.362
Whoa.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.230
Who's that?

12:12.232 --> 12:15.266
Carmen essaye,

12:15.268 --> 12:18.570
55 to 59 years old.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.772
That's an interesting twist.

12:20.774 --> 12:21.806
>> white pages,

12:21.808 --> 12:23.208
There's associated people,

12:23.210 --> 12:24.976
Which often means relatives.

12:24.978 --> 12:25.777
And there's someone named

12:25.779 --> 12:26.478
Joseph.

<i>Answer some questions</i>

<i>For the past few years,</i>

14:18.825 --> 14:19.691
<i>What would be great is if you</i>

<i>Could just tell us if it is</i>

14:21.628 --> 14:23.695
<i>His cell phone number.</i>

<i>Right, so--</i>

14:27.334 --> 14:27.999
<i>No, totally.</i>

14:28.001 --> 14:29.200
<i>So all I'm asking is if I give</i>

14:29.202 --> 14:31.135
<i>You the number that we have,</i>

14:31.137 --> 14:32.837
<i>If you could just say yes or no,</i>

14:32.839 --> 14:35.406
<i>That's his number.</i>

<i>The number we have is 561-</i>

14:38.078 --> 14:40.144
<i>[bleep].</i>

14:40.146 --> 14:45.650
<i>That is not his number.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

14:46.920 --> 14:47.986
<i>You don't happen to know whose</i>

14:47.988 --> 14:50.054
<i>Phone number that is, do you?</i>

14:50.056 --> 14:53.691
<i>Have you ever heard him talk</i>

14:53.693 --> 14:55.760
<i>About a girl named antoinette?</i>

14:55.762 --> 15:06.738
<i>>> does he have anyone helping</i>

15:06.740 --> 15:08.373
<i>Him sort through all that social</i>

15:08.375 --> 15:11.309
<i>Media, mail, and whatnot?</i>

15:11.311 --> 15:16.314
<i>>> and his older brother</i>

15:16.316 --> 15:18.116
<i>Joseph is--he's the married</i>

15:18.118 --> 15:21.085
<i>Brother, right?</i>

15:21.087 --> 15:22.387
<i>And they have pretty similar</i>

15:22.389 --> 15:24.455
<i>Sounding voices.</i>

15:24.457 --> 15:34.599
<i>I really appreciate your help.</i>

15:34.601 --> 15:35.867
<i>All right. Later.</i>

15:35.869 --> 15:38.169
<i>>> brothers' voices are so</i>

15:38.171 --> 15:39.938
<i>Similar that he can't tell</i>

15:39.940 --> 15:40.605
<i>The difference.</i>

15:40.607 --> 15:41.372
<i>>> even a close friend can't</i>

15:41.374 --> 15:42.040
<i>Tell the difference.</i>

15:42.042 --> 15:44.175
<i>And that's not</i>

15:44.177 --> 15:47.879
<i>His cell phone number.</i>

15:47.881 --> 15:49.280
<i>Okay, wait a second.</i>

15:49.282 --> 15:51.549
<i>One weird thing that now</i>

15:51.551 --> 15:53.251
<i>Kind of makes sense</i>

15:53.253 --> 15:54.485
<i>Is remember when antoinette</i>

15:54.487 --> 15:57.021
<i>Said, "he just screen grabs</i>

15:57.023 --> 15:59.891
<i>My posts and texts them to me."</i>

15:59.893 --> 16:01.326
<i>She showed us one.</i>

16:01.328 --> 16:02.393
<i>It was a screen grab of</i>

16:02.395 --> 16:03.261
<i>The instagram post with some</i>

16:03.263 --> 16:05.129
<i>Comments, and then his text</i>

16:05.131 --> 16:06.464
<i>Underneath.</i>

16:06.466 --> 16:07.999
<i>He's not actually using</i>

16:08.001 --> 16:09.834
<i>The albert ambrose instagram.</i>

16:09.836 --> 16:10.768
<i>>> pretty weird, yeah.</i>

16:10.770 --> 16:12.003
<i>>> yeah, that's weird,</i>

16:12.005 --> 16:12.971
<i>Which would make sense</i>

16:12.973 --> 16:14.439
<i>If it wasn't really albert.</i>

16:14.441 --> 16:15.173
<i>>> right.</i>

16:15.175 --> 16:16.541
<i>>> it's not impossible</i>

16:16.543 --> 16:18.276
<i>That two years ago,</i>

16:18.278 --> 16:21.012
<i>Albert was showing his brother</i>

16:21.014 --> 16:22.580
<i>This super-hot girl,</i>

16:22.582 --> 16:23.381
<i>And that he was like, "wow.</i>

16:23.383 --> 16:24.682
<i>She is really hot."</i>

16:24.684 --> 16:25.917
<i>And then he noticed</i>

16:25.919 --> 16:27.785
<i>That she had posted her handle.</i>

16:27.787 --> 16:28.987
<i>He was like, "oh, I want to talk</i>

16:28.989 --> 16:29.654
<i>To this girl."</i>

16:29.656 --> 16:31.556
<i>And he hit her up.</i>

16:31.558 --> 16:33.324
<i>If it is the brother,</i>

16:33.326 --> 16:34.759
<i>We're entering into a sort of</i>

16:34.761 --> 16:36.661
<i>Very sticky situation.</i>

16:36.663 --> 16:38.296
<i>Because as far as we can tell,</i>

16:38.298 --> 16:39.764
<i>He is currently married.</i>

16:39.766 --> 16:41.332
<i>>> so his whole life could</i>

16:41.334 --> 16:42.633
<i>Essentially be ruined</i>

16:42.635 --> 16:45.303
<i>If we go to florida to meet him.</i>

16:45.305 --> 16:47.205
<i>>> how do we deal with that?</i>

16:47.207 --> 16:48.272
<i>Albert's a real dude.</i>

16:48.274 --> 16:49.273
<i>He's in this band.</i>

16:49.275 --> 16:50.174
<i>Pictures are him.</i>

16:50.176 --> 16:51.242
<i>He's legit.</i>

16:51.244 --> 16:52.110
<i>We just don't know</i>

16:52.112 --> 16:54.178
<i>Who's holding that phone.</i>

16:54.180 --> 17:02.687
<i>>> holy [bleep].</i>

17:02.689 --> 17:06.190
<i>>> why would she post that?</i>

17:06.192 --> 17:08.593
<i>>> I feel like we glossed over</i>

17:08.595 --> 17:09.894
<i>The image that she's putting</i>

17:09.896 --> 17:10.994
<i>Forth on instagram.</i>

17:10.997 --> 17:11.796

17:11.798 --> 17:13.330
<i>For antoinette now.</i>

17:13.333 --> 17:15.532
<i>And we have some information</i>

<i>We can give her.</i>

17:24.644 --> 17:26.810
<i>We've got some leads,</i>

<i>If we can come and meet you</i>

<i>I dress or anything like that.</i>

<i>>> the concern that I would have</i>

<i>Is that, you know,</i>

18:59.005 --> 19:00.338
<i>A year or two from now</i>

<i>You might go for a job</i>

<i>Application somewhere,</i>

19:02.909 --> 19:04.242
<i>And they might search your name.</i>

19:04.244 --> 19:05.510
<i>And the first ten things that</i>

19:05.512 --> 19:07.378
<i>Come up might be things that</i>

<i>You might not want them to see.</i>

<i>>> yeah.</i>

<i>Depending on what you're trying</i>

<i>To get as your job.</i>

19:10.617 --> 19:11.282
<i>>> right. Exactly.</i>

<i>>> yeah, that's an obvious.</i>

19:12.852 --> 19:14.886
<i>>> my concern with this</i>

<i>Different than what she really</i>

19:19.592 --> 19:21.526
<i>Is.</i>

19:21.528 --> 19:23.261
<i>And I certainly don't want her</i>

19:23.263 --> 19:24.162
<i>To feel like she has to live up</i>

<i>To that when she does meet him.</i>
