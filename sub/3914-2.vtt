00:08.217 --> 00:09.832
LUCY: Previously
on Killjoys...

00:09.927 --> 00:10.962
Killjoys, huh?

00:11.094 --> 00:12.345
Reclamation agents.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.294
We offer one simple service.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.637
Find who or
what you’re
looking for,

00:15.766 --> 00:17.631
and bring it back to you
in the condition requested.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.259
If I don't terminate
you by the warrant's end,
they'll send another agent,

00:20.395 --> 00:21.646
and another, until it’s done.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.683
D'AVIN: Look,
you don't want me here,
I don't want to be here.

00:23.774 --> 00:24.934
So, why don't you
just drop me off

00:25.067 --> 00:26.432
at the next port
and I'll be on my way?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.183
Do you even know
what he did to
earn this warrant?

00:28.278 --> 00:30.564
No, but I know him.
He's my brother.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.028
D'AVIN: Someone obvious/y
put a lot oftime and money
into training her.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.733
Don't you want to
know who or why?

00:37.955 --> 00:39.786
KHLYEN: I'll show you
how to use this, shall I?

00:40.791 --> 00:42.577
Each time you
receive a red box,

00:42.668 --> 00:44.659
you will have
a duty to perform.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.007
(MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

01:02.479 --> 01:03.514
(CRAFT RUMBLING)
Oh!

01:03.689 --> 01:06.146
And we have stick.
Make it count, Dutch.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.768
DUTCH: Just keep it tight
and keep him busy.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.110
JOHN: That's what she said.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.695
John.
Sorry.

01:10.988 --> 01:15.527
Monsoon. Monsoon.
This is reclamation
agent John Jaqobis.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.867
I'm staring at
a warrant for 200 crates
of primo Qreshi sea salt

01:18.996 --> 01:21.112
that magical/y got up
and walked into your ho/d.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.707
So, what say you throttle down

01:22.833 --> 01:25.290
and see ifwe can't
turn that cargo back
towards Westerley?

01:25.502 --> 01:29.120
Killjoy, you think you can
slow me down back there, huh?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.546
You can take your warrant

01:31.675 --> 01:34.166
and shove it where
the air ain't sweet.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.338

01:35.804 --> 01:38.671

got ourselves a live one.

DUTCH: Damn it, John, are you
on a pee break? Level out.
(THUDDING)

01:42.519 --> 01:44.055
I told you,
harpooning a heavy hauler

01:44.187 --> 01:45.643
is not like
catching satellites, Dutch.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.847
We're bruising.
Lucy, engage thrusters.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.518

Ow!

02:04.583 --> 02:07.541
Look, Lucy's not
built for this abuse,
nor does she deserve it.

02:07.753 --> 02:08.868
LUCY: Thank you, John.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.710

I’m almost there.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.379
Thirty seconds.
I'll give you 10.

Well, where's the we?
ljust see you.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.556
Yeah, Dutch had
the bright idea to...

02:28.899 --> 02:30.389
Lucy, what the hell was that?

02:30.525 --> 02:32.390
LUCY: ljust lost
my rear gyroscope.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.142
Tight outfit you guys
are running here.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.363
Dutch, I've got to cut bait.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.982
Lucy can't take this.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.232
Here goes nothing.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.488
LUCY: Much better, John.
Thank you.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.160
(EXHALES)

02:45.082 --> 02:46.242
You hear that, Killjoy?

02:46.375 --> 02:48.331
That's the sound of me
toasting the windfall

02:48.418 --> 02:49.828
that you let me get
away with. (CHUCKLES)

02:50.545 --> 02:51.580

02:55.050 --> 02:56.165

02:56.885 --> 02:58.250
That's the sound
of a Killjoy

02:58.345 --> 03:00.051
breaching your ship
and laying hands.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.091
Cute knife.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.354
Marry me.
Tempting.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.777
But let's turn this
baby back to space port
and lighten your load.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.736
I will say this.
You do have some
fine taste in gear.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.951
JOHN: Dutch, you pushed us
too close to the edge
on that one.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.282
And bribing me
with sleazoid's gear?

03:30.377 --> 03:32.618
That's not going
to make up for it.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.370
DUTCH: Copy that.
No buying of love.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.926
Hello.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.801
Peace torch accepted.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.893
Hey, I know what you like.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.142
You know what I'd like?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.144
Not to stand in line
for my own shower.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.149
I know D'av can't
stay here without papers,

03:57.279 --> 03:59.486
but I haven't had
a minute between gigs
to talk to him.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.157
lfyou're not up to it,
I'd be happy to help.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.614
No,no,no.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.483
He's my brother,
he's my responsibility.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.818
Obviously,
he's a little fragile.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.819
Just got to warm
him up a little,
ease into it, and...

04:07.956 --> 04:09.492
DUTCH: Hey, soldier boy.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.078
I said you could stay
on my ship one night.
It's been a week.

Find another crash pad.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.665
So,yeah.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.417
Johnny,Pdlove
get out of your hair.
But you know my situation.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.754
No money, no ship, no papers
for any world in this system.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.840
Then, let me help.
Oh, here it comes.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.515
We'll find you work,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.935
which means papers for
Westerley at least, and money.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.262
And all the time
in the world

04:33.356 --> 04:35.187
to figure out your
next steps together.

04:35.317 --> 04:38.525
John, I've been
under the boot of
the army nine years.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.523
Six months stuck in
a cage on a fight ship.

I'm not going to get
stuck in some mining job

04:42.866 --> 04:44.982
or whatever crap-slinging gig
you want me tied to.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.655
I need to be free.
How are you free
stuck inside Lucy?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.871
Hey, I'm not done with you.
You know what?
You want me gone?

To drink. A lot.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.297
You know you can't.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.794
You want me off,
you want me on...

05:02.886 --> 05:04.501
Make up your damn minds.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.713

05:16.566 --> 05:17.851
It's your new warrant.

ain't optional.

She got nabbed last night.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.264
Piece of work
holding her is named R'yo.

Let me guess. The brother's
the freak on my ship?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.026
Simon Muraayn.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.522
Been cooling his
jets in Westhole Prison
the past three years

06:06.616 --> 06:08.868
on attempt theft,
Company gear.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.153
We bought a hostage exchange
warrant with the RAC.

06:12.289 --> 06:16.032
You give Simon to his sister,
you bring Vena home safe.

the Mayor's baby,

06:29.556 --> 06:33.014
Her Worship becomes
a loyal friend
in a high place.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.436
That's why we need Killjoys.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.806
Can't have Company
boots on the ground.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.147
Ifwe hire you people,
it can't be traced to us.

to arrange the meet.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.326
One, Hills,

06:54.414 --> 06:56.575
I don't work for the Company,
I work for the RAC.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.748
I pick my own warrants. Two,

06:59.044 --> 07:00.625
I really need a break.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.545
Look, let's
make this simple.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.001
You don't take the warrant,

07:06.092 --> 07:07.673
I charge you for
letting an illegal

07:07.761 --> 07:09.626
step off your ship.

07:09.721 --> 07:13.805
And I burn your
docking privileges.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.767

let him on in the first place.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.182

you mightwant him.

07:24.736 --> 07:25.771
What's Sugar Point?

07:25.862 --> 07:28.478
It's not like I wanted
a pint at the Royale and
a tumble in the back room,

07:28.573 --> 07:29.608
like, ever again.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.280

DUTCH: Don't blame me.
Blame your brother.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.653
Excuse me?
So, this R'yo, she's...

07:32.744 --> 07:35.076
A warlord. Smuggles
in weapons and drugs.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.619

what's Sugar Point?

07:36.706 --> 07:37.741

07:47.550 --> 07:49.632
brush your teeth.
SIMON: I got a bad gut.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.797

to make me...

07:51.888 --> 07:53.674

to make me hurl.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.922
Please, chief, maybe, uh...

07:56.017 --> 07:57.223
Maybe you could
leave it off?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.811
Nausea. Right.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.137
This is a warrant,
not a pleasure cruise.
Full Iockdown.

back home to his sister.
He's not a flight risk.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.605
I don't know him,
I don't trust him.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.485
Already got one of those
running loose on my ship,

08:09.572 --> 08:11.779
don't need another.
Holler when we're
ready to bounce.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.662
She your partner
or your boss?

She's my partner.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.410

08:22.210 --> 08:23.916
Partner-boss. Whatever, so?

08:24.254 --> 08:27.166
Okay, look. Stuck on
the ship's got me on edge.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.296
I know it's done
a number on you guys, too.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.420
So, when we're back

08:31.511 --> 08:33.593
I'll take your advice
and find work.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.254
Yeah?

08:37.767 --> 08:39.883
Good. Good.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.851
And whenever you're
ready to talk about

08:41.938 --> 08:43.849
why you're here or
where you've been...

08:43.940 --> 08:45.396
I'll find a pretty
girl who will listen.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.814
Right.

08:51.448 --> 08:52.688
Better?

08:52.824 --> 08:54.234
(EXHALES)

08:55.952 --> 08:57.658
LUCY: Biohazard detected.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.121
Maybe you can
leave it off, huh?
Just to be safe.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.407
You get the mop.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.759
KHLYEN: One name. One weapon.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.425
From the time you
receive the box,

09:14.512 --> 09:17.470
you'll have one week
to do as I've asked.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.303
What happens if I don't?

09:25.523 --> 09:26.979
Very bad things.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.308
JOHN: Fueled and ready.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.273
What's the box?

09:33.364 --> 09:34.865
Nothing. Souvenir.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.324
Let's make this warrant.
Lucy, take us out.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.988
JOHN: Welcome to Sugar Point.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.160
D'AVIN: What the hell
happened here?
JOHN: Rebellion.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.412
The whole city was one
big sweet gas operation.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.119

better conditions,

09:49.214 --> 09:50.624
the Company answers with guns,

09:50.882 --> 09:55.342
gas wells go up in flames,
executives get beheaded,
the ushe.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.089
But the Company
ended the rebellion

09:57.180 --> 09:58.340
by bombing
the hell out of the place

09:58.431 --> 10:01.468
and put the wall up.
Now it's no one in or out.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.933
I've seen bad,
but not with people
still living there.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.180
Not by choice.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.683
Anyone that was left
was punished by the Company.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.477
Forced to work
for crap wages.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.400
They strip what's
left of anything
valuable and ship it out.

10:12.487 --> 10:15.479
Or, you know, become a warlord
and smuggle contraband in.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.023
Like our new friend, R'yo.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.828
Company intel says
yellow's R'yo's turf.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.535
Dangerous.
And the green?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.863
Even worse.
Desperate scavengers.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.869
Recycling meets gang warfare.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.745
The only thing R'yo
and the scavengers

10:28.837 --> 10:30.793
hate more than each
other is the Company.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.005
Nice. So, that's why they
hired you. Neutral party.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.549
We close?
Got to come in low
'cause of the smoke.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.752
But that tower?
That's our rendezvous.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.131
D'AVIN: Looks like
a plasma cell on the roof.
What's it for?

10:42.225 --> 10:44.637
LUCY: I’m afraid
the more immediate danger
is on the ground,

10:44.727 --> 10:46.263
south by southwest.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.011
(ALARM BLARING)
Hey, Lucy, what the
hell was that?

10:48.148 --> 10:51.060
LUCY: A ground-based hostile
is showing unwanted attention.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.564
Get down for cover.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.687
It's too tight.
Peel starboard and high.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.858
We don't know
where the weapon is.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.277
John's good.
He can squeeze us through.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.570
Do you have
a death wish?
Do you?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.113
I don't. Both of you, shut up.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.070

Oh, could it?
John.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.077
Emergency power online.
Asses in both hands, you guys.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.503
We're coming in hard.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.335
(GRUNTING)

11:16.676 --> 11:19.213
Lucy? Are you there?
I need a full diagnostic.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.090
LUCY: Processing.
What are we carrying?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.050
Carrying?
Weapons, shields.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.176
We're sitting ducks here.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.427
Whoever shot us down
is going to come after us.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.928
Yeah, yeah, about that,
who did shoot us down?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.885
What do they want?
We're the ones here
to do the exchange.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.346
John, why are you
opening the cargo door?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.185
I'm not.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.646
Simon. (SIGHS)

11:37.989 --> 11:39.195
Why would he do that?

11:39.574 --> 11:40.780
We had
a gentleman's agreement.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.983
DUTCH: Remind me to shoot
one of you geniuses later.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.869
John, I know
who shot us down.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.296
Scavengers.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.498
We landed on the wrong side.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.180
JOHN: Look, why would he run?

12:03.264 --> 12:04.720
He knows we're
bringing him back
to his sister.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.139
And may I add,
how the hell did he
slip the restraints?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.467
JOHN: I...
Just don't.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.268
Gear up.
Long guns and survival packs.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.972
We're running down Simon
and walking him to the
exchange with R'yo.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.773
And then what?
You're going to
need an extraction.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.600
I'm the only one that can
get Lucy flying again.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.072
So, I have to stay here.
You have to take D'av.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.855
No way.
He is no Killjoy.
No.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.111
I need you, John.
D'AVIN: You're a
stationary target

12:24.202 --> 12:26.534
with hostiles on all sides.
Sitting here alone is suicide.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.452
That girl is out there
waiting for rescue.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.279
So, take D'av, use his skills.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.373
The warrant is all.

Here, I've tuned this
to Lucy's ion signature.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.057
Now, Simon would have
picked it up from the flight.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.179
But it's fading fast.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.431
You sure you're good alone?

touch me. Go. Go.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.810
Go.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.228
LUCY: Are you confused, John?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.902
The defense protocols
will deplete my battery.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.325
They don't need to
know that, Lucy. Besides,

13:08.788 --> 13:11.905
I'll have you back in shape
long before then, sweetheart.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.206
But thanks for
the vote of confidence.

So, Iwant to set
your mind at ease.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.846
Sorry, what?

13:25.930 --> 13:28.387
I told Johnny I'd get
a job when this is over.

13:29.684 --> 13:30.890
Good plan.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.387
Yeah, well, I lied.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.553
You can't live on Westerley

Sure.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.857

in the sewers of Old Town.

Outlaws in the Badlands.
I've been doing my research.

13:46.617 --> 13:47.652
This way.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.986
I've put 100
outlaws behind bars.
You're no outlaw.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.828
All I'm asking is,
when this is over,

13:52.915 --> 13:54.200
you drop me off
in the Badlands.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.078
You never have
to see me again.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.493
Why are you
really here, D'avin?

make a thing of it.

I'll make a thing
of it ifyou don't.

Simon's trail, barely.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.787

15:20.420 --> 15:22.911
Front-door-only access,

15:23.297 --> 15:24.798
Not the easiest
place to recon.

make some sketches?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.965

15:28.052 --> 15:29.337

get on your knees.

from here to the Stank Belt.

to say goodbye.

A great deal ofit.

Never come to
Sugar Point, man.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.958
Never come to Sugar Point.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.418
So, a Killjoy badge
always get you in
the door like that?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.170
Pretty much,
The Company may
own Westerley

18:15.303 --> 18:17.009
but everyone in the Quad
respects a RAC warrant.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.341

the RAC was the Company.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.515
Nope. But they're
our biggest clients
in this system.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.928

are complicated.

One planet, three moons,
lots of borders.

Warrants served
by a neutral party
helps keep things clean.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.983
You should have mentioned
you wanted a side trip.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.659

it into the tour.

They'd tend the

from throat to crotch.

R'yo moved orbits
and tides because

19:54.735 --> 19:56.191
she loves you and
wants you with her again.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.779
She doesn't care about me.

34:31.361 --> 34:34.148
LUCY: John, you sound
distressed. Can lhelp?

34:34.990 --> 34:36.696
Big balls. Big target.
(G ROANS)

34:46.585 --> 34:48.371
Hey, can we discuss
this like gentlemen?

34:49.004 --> 34:50.414
How about a peace offering?

34:53.675 --> 34:55.040
DUTCH: That was fun.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.213
As promised,
high ground.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.837
How are you for ammo?
Drained.

35:00.765 --> 35:01.925
You didn't wonder
why I was throwing

35:02.017 --> 35:03.678
finger grenades for
the last two floors?

35:03.768 --> 35:05.383
Figured you were
a blow-up-shit kind of guy.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.096
I'm out, too.

35:12.694 --> 35:13.729
Are we trapped?

35:15.113 --> 35:16.614
I don't know.

35:16.865 --> 35:17.900
Hope you've got a plan

35:18.033 --> 35:20.024
to get us down from here
because Mama can't fly.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.033
Lazlo chamber
inferno missile.

35:23.413 --> 35:26.746
Two hundred click range,
burns like the sun.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.539
No one should
have one of these.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.618
That's what
the code is for.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.294
Did you take us up
just to disarm it?
No.

35:33.715 --> 35:35.205
But while we're up here,
we might as well.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.381
(BEEPING)

35:38.219 --> 35:40.380
Keep it holstered,
darling.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.724
DUTCH: Look who's talking.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.803
That's some junk
you've got hoisted.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.977
R'YO: Do you know what
happened here, little girl?

35:49.105 --> 35:51.721
The Company unleashed
a firestorm on us.

35:52.734 --> 35:56.602
My parents, my friends.
Iwatched them burn.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.732
Then they made the survivors

35:58.823 --> 36:01.075
strip our own homes
down to dirt.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.736
This is payback.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.819
An unopened love letter
I'm returning to sender.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.079
Right in
the heart of Old Town.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.407
Where itwill hurt
the Company most.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.667
Too bad we fried
your launch codes.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.290
I'll find another
way to get them.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.459
Get rid of this trash.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.092
D'AVIN: I'll draw their fire.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.215
You make a run for it.
Like hell.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.263
JOHN: (ON PA)
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your social director.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.224
Those ofyou not wishing to be
blasted into a dewy mist,

36:32.315 --> 36:34.271
please step away
from your firearms.

36:34.401 --> 36:35.766
DUTCH: Johnny.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.815
Smart and punctual.
Two hours on the dot.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.900
JOHN: Would
you look at that?

36:45.995 --> 36:47.735
You guys didn't kill
each other after all.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.787
Glad you made it
to the party.

36:49.999 --> 36:53.082
Looks like someone
had some fun with his
new plasma torch.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.665
Let's get Vena
home to Leith.

36:55.797 --> 36:59.415
You know, I could strip some
really great gear off that
missile down there.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.008
Yeah, I might have made
a few modifications.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.177
(MISSILE BEEPING)

37:07.767 --> 37:09.052
R'YO: Hurry it up.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.429
Shit, it's going to blow.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.815
Clean your weapon.
Get back to your
chambers.

37:23.450 --> 37:24.485
(SNIFFLES)

37:24.659 --> 37:28.026
Itwas him or you.
Never let it be you.

37:29.164 --> 37:32.201
But who was he? Why him?

37:34.127 --> 37:37.119
Why is a question
my little bird must
never ask.

38:01.905 --> 38:02.985
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

38:03.072 --> 38:04.323
Open.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.865
Vena's mother
says thank you,
via a hefty bonus.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.371
Warrant fee and tip,
minus the RAC's

38:14.501 --> 38:15.581
10% skim
on all gratuities,

38:16.503 --> 38:19.370
and minus the outstanding bill
for damages on Qresh.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.588
And we're flush.
Finally.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.133
So, let me ask you this.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.381
Yes, take a week off.
You earned it.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.721
We all did.
Who broke into Lucy?

38:31.601 --> 38:32.716
No one.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.476
You increased security.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.349
I was paranoid
about your brother.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.102
Before I got
to know him.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.230
Dutch.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.947
If you have any business
that you need squared away...

38:49.452 --> 38:52.239
I'll square it away. Promise.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.410
Good.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.274
Not that I'm complaining,

39:24.612 --> 39:26.022
but why has this
delicious thing

39:26.114 --> 39:28.105
been allowed
off-ship without papers?

39:28.449 --> 39:29.950
Temporary permit.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.366
Damn. How did
you swing that?

39:32.453 --> 39:34.114
Hills owed us, after
what we just pulled off.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.948
I mean, I don't like to use
the word heroes, but

39:38.543 --> 39:39.703
(WHISPERS) we're heroes.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.785
We cleaned up a mess
they didn't see coming.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.207
We agreed to keep our
mouths shut, and barn.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.376
One shiny new
visitor's permit for me.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.917
One week to find
a job or clear out.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.217
Hmm.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.387
Bar-back position is filled.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.725
But I have sexer—rooms
for rent upstairs.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.800
If you're willing to
work with someone's legs
around your ears.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.393
Pree, please. Let's not lower
the Royale's standards.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.972
(SCOFFS) Sweetums,
this is Westerley.
Low is the standard.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.480
You're just in time.
We're helping D'avin
decide on a job.

40:09.616 --> 40:13.234
Hey, I got it. I got it.
Algae farm night watchman.

40:13.328 --> 40:14.408
Boom.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.281
Actually, John,
there's something
I should tell you.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.994
I know you want me to stick
around and get a regularjob.

40:20.126 --> 40:23.664
But I've been
considering another option.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.414
Killjoy.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.920
Killjoy?

40:30.345 --> 40:34.509
IJlsponsoryou.
Ifyou pass the tests,
you have a berth on Lucy.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.260
VVhy?

40:37.352 --> 40:38.512
Well, you don't suck at it.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.260
And new blood's
good sometimes.

40:40.355 --> 40:41.640
Keeps things interesting.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.098
Plus, for some dumb reason,
Johnny seems to like you.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.184
Sort of.
Say I was a badass today.

40:48.613 --> 40:52.652
I'm saying you helped us make
the warrant, save the girl,

40:52.825 --> 40:55.362
and keep a weapon
of mass destruction
away from a crazy lady.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.695
If you want to scrub toilets
in the Badlands, fine.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.197
But if you want more of that,

41:01.876 --> 41:02.956
come be a Killjoy.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.284
Killjoy.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.539
You've got a week
to think about it.

41:05.630 --> 41:06.710
Yes.

41:10.176 --> 41:14.385
Enjoy your night, boys.
I've got some business
to get squared.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.139
Well, all right.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.556
The Jaqobis brothers
together as Killjoys.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.228
That's awesome.

41:24.524 --> 41:25.730
Right?
Yeah.

41:58.766 --> 41:59.755
(GROANING)

42:00.768 --> 42:04.932
Khlyen wants you dead.
And I want to know why.
