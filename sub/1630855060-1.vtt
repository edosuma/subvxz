Zoe!

02:08.750 --> 02:11.042
- Aunty Aisha.
- Lovely to see you, Zoe.

02:11.042 --> 02:12.833
You're looking fresh.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.792
- Oh. Excuse me. Sorry.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.708
Hello. No, no, I can talk.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.000
She's always going!

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh. Oh, right. Um...

02:23.917 --> 02:26.083
Well, can I come in
and discuss this with you?

02:26.083 --> 02:27.750
I have other ideas.

02:28.917 --> 02:30.917
That's great. Okay, goodbye.

02:31.417 --> 02:32.458
Long time no see,

02:32.458 --> 02:34.292
Miss award winning
documentary maker.

02:34.292 --> 02:35.375
Can I have your autograph, please?

02:35.375 --> 02:36.500
Kaz.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.417
What are you doing up there?

02:38.417 --> 02:40.917
- Same as always. Sneaky ciggy.
- Oh.

02:40.917 --> 02:42.167
Come up.

02:42.167 --> 02:43.833
Please don't tell me

02:43.833 --> 02:46.042
your parents still don't know you smoke?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.333

I'm an oncology registrar.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.042
It's not the best look, is it?

02:50.042 --> 02:52.458
But they're happy
now I'm getting married.

02:52.458 --> 02:55.792
You are? Hey, congratulations.

02:55.792 --> 02:58.042
- Who's the lucky lady?
- Don't know yet.

02:58.042 --> 02:59.458
What do you mean?

02:59.458 --> 03:00.708
I'm going old school
on this one.

03:00.708 --> 03:02.042
I'm getting
an arranged marriage.

03:02.042 --> 03:03.333
"Assisted marriage".

03:03.333 --> 03:05.000
That's what we're calling it
these days.

03:05.375 --> 03:06.583
Huh...

03:06.583 --> 03:08.625
What, like assisted suicide?

03:10.125 --> 03:11.375
I can't get my head round

03:11.375 --> 03:13.292
marrying someone
you don't know.

03:13.292 --> 03:14.333
It might be easier

03:14.333 --> 03:15.833
than marrying someone
you do know.

03:15.833 --> 03:16.917
Mmm.

03:16.917 --> 03:18.083
Did you never wanna
get married?

03:18.083 --> 03:21.125
Ooh,
"never" is a bit harsh.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.375
I'm still interviewing.

03:22.375 --> 03:25.417
- I haven't yet met the one.
- Ah, the one.

03:25.417 --> 03:26.917
You know, just
someone who I could commit

03:26.917 --> 03:29.708
to watching a whole
TV series with, would be nice.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.208
Be nice.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.083
Hey, where's your little
sister? I haven't seen her.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.375
- Jamila?
- Yeah.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.542
- She couldn't make it.

03:36.542 --> 03:37.625
Sounds like
it's kicking off in there.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.000
We should...
Let's go back inside.

03:40.083 --> 03:42.000
I'm gonna have
to find a new hiding place.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.292
They're cutting down the tree.

03:43.292 --> 03:44.792
- No?
- Yeah.

03:44.792 --> 03:48.667
That's... That's so sad!
This is our tree!

03:48.667 --> 03:49.792
I know. Come on.

03:54.875 --> 03:57.500
Look at Farooq. He's so happy.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.625
Oh, God. Mum dancing.

04:01.042 --> 04:02.708
- Thank you, Aisha, darling.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.042
That was just heaven.

04:04.042 --> 04:05.625
I'll be back
for a <i>gupshup</i> tomorrow.

04:05.625 --> 04:06.750
Bye.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.292
- Oh.

04:08.292 --> 04:10.708
Wasn't it just
so wonderfully exotic?

04:10.708 --> 04:14.625
I felt... I felt like some
sort of glorious concubine.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.541
Exotic meaning
good foreign rather than

04:16.541 --> 04:18.083
- threatening foreign.
- Yeah, exactly.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.416
Cath, I forgot to give you
some biryani.

04:20.416 --> 04:22.667
Oh, darling,
thank you so much.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.667
Oh! I cannot believe
that you did not tell me

04:25.667 --> 04:28.542
that Kaz has asked you
to find him a wife.

04:28.542 --> 04:29.917
Oh, my God. You are so lucky.

04:29.917 --> 04:33.458
Zoe would kill me if I even
tried to choose her clothes,

04:33.458 --> 04:34.792
let alone a husband.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.792
That's because you'd choose
someone ill-fitting

04:36.792 --> 04:39.292
- and insist I grow into him.
- That's mean.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.958
- That's what you would do.
- Stop it, both...

04:40.958 --> 04:42.417
- Bye-bye.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.708
- Goodnight.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

04:44.708 --> 04:46.708
Night, Mum.
- Bye, darling. Buckle up.

04:49.917 --> 04:53.875
So, Zoe, we loved your doc.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.375
Oh, loved it.

04:55.375 --> 04:58.000
- Kids in care?
- Yes, that one.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.583
That's great.
Because I was hoping...

04:59.583 --> 05:01.125
Unfortunately,

05:01.958 --> 05:04.792
your ideas
for your next one...

05:04.792 --> 05:08.292
The bankruptcy courts,
honour killings...

05:08.292 --> 05:10.208
They're a bit bleak.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.042
- Downbeat.
- Yeah. And, you know...

05:12.042 --> 05:13.917
Your scratchier,
darker stuff...

05:13.917 --> 05:14.667
- Which we love.
- We love it

05:14.667 --> 05:16.917
right down to the bones.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.250
- Yeah.
- But...

05:18.250 --> 05:19.708
It's not really rating
for us right now.

05:19.708 --> 05:21.500
I think, look,
what we're after

05:21.500 --> 05:23.458
is sort of more upbeat...

05:23.458 --> 05:24.875
Yeah.
- Character-led stories.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.417
- Warm heart...
- Yeah.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.500
Um, feel-good, really.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.750
And we were
kind of brainstorming,

05:28.750 --> 05:30.708
and we think
that there probably isn't

05:30.708 --> 05:34.500
a feel-good version
of honour killings.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.542
- Probably not.
- But, er...

05:36.542 --> 05:39.750
Thank you very much
for coming in.

05:39.750 --> 05:40.958
We've connected now.

05:40.958 --> 05:42.417
Look, we've got
your details now.

05:42.417 --> 05:43.625
So, silver lining.
Always look at the upside.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.167
Actually, hang on.

05:46.167 --> 05:49.875
Arranged marriages in modern
multi-cultural Britain.

05:51.167 --> 05:53.500
- Sorry, I wasn't listening...
- I'm sorry...

05:53.500 --> 05:56.000
I was just explaining
that my childhood friend

05:56.000 --> 05:57.833
whose parents
are from Pakistan...

05:57.833 --> 05:59.083
He was born in Pakistan? Cool.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.333
No, he was born here.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.250
But he lived literally
next door to me,

06:02.250 --> 06:03.458
and we grew up together.

06:03.458 --> 06:06.292
And he's just decided
to have an arranged marriage.

06:06.292 --> 06:08.375
I could follow him
on his journey

06:08.375 --> 06:10.167
to marry a stranger

06:10.167 --> 06:12.292
chosen by his parents.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.917
What's he... What's he like?

06:16.917 --> 06:19.000
Well, he's great,
he's funny, good-looking.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.875
- Funny's good.
- Really funny!

06:20.875 --> 06:22.750
Kind. Er, you know...

06:23.333 --> 06:25.042
Literally, the last person
you'd ever expect

06:25.042 --> 06:26.750
to do something like this.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.708
I could interview
other British couples

06:28.708 --> 06:30.417
who've also had
arranged marriages.

06:30.417 --> 06:32.833
Um, older, younger,
happy, unhappy.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.208
Yeah, like in
<i>When Harry Met Sally.</i>

06:34.208 --> 06:35.958
Ooh, erm, don't you mean

06:35.958 --> 06:37.958
When Harry Was Forced
To Meet Sally?

06:37.958 --> 06:39.583
-  Right. Nice.

06:39.583 --> 06:43.083
Well, this isn't
a forced marriage, actually.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.375
This is his idea.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.750
My Big Fat Arranged Wedding.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.458
Instead of Greek, yeah.
Oh, love it.

06:49.458 --> 06:52.792
Everyone thinks
that arranged marriages

06:52.792 --> 06:54.917
are some sort of
mediaeval chattel swap,

06:54.917 --> 06:56.667
but actually they've evolved

06:56.667 --> 06:59.333
into what's called
assisted marriage

06:59.333 --> 07:01.375
with the parents
just suggesting someone

07:01.375 --> 07:03.042
who they think would be
a good match.

07:03.042 --> 07:04.542
Yeah, love that.
Absolutely love that.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.417
Now, I'm just thinking.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.375
Meet The Parents First.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.875
- Meet The Parents First.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.125
- Right. Erm, Or, erm...
- It's called <i>Meet The Parents.</i>

07:11.125 --> 07:14.167
I Hope She's
A Pretty Woman.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.875
Love Contractually.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.750
- I <i>Love Actually</i> it.
- Yeah.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.875
I mean, think about it.
You got... You got eth, tick.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.667
Female director. Double tick.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.500
Huh!

07:33.083 --> 07:34.125
Wow.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.458
Are him
and his family on board?

07:41.125 --> 07:42.500
Totally.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.708
Absolutely not. No.

07:43.708 --> 07:46.000
<i>Come on, Kaz. I'm down
on my knees. I'm begging you.</i>

07:46.000 --> 07:47.417
Out of the question, Zoe.

07:47.417 --> 07:49.375
<i>Kaz, will you please just
do this for me?</i>

07:49.375 --> 07:50.458
Zoe...

07:50.458 --> 07:52.750
-<i>Please!</i>
- I can't talk right now.

07:52.750 --> 07:53.958
<i>I don't know if you've heard,</i>

07:53.958 --> 07:56.292
but I'm an award-winning
documentary film-maker.

07:56.292 --> 07:58.250
- Yeah. I did hear that, yeah.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.708
<i>Also, aren't you...
I mean, listen...</i>

07:59.708 --> 08:01.375
<i>Aren't you proud
to be a Muslim?</i>

08:01.375 --> 08:03.500
Of course I'm a proud Muslim.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.875
<i>Yeah, then wouldn't it be
a good thing to see</i>

08:06.875 --> 08:08.542
someone like you
on TV for once?

08:08.542 --> 08:11.000
Don't extremist madmen
make more entertaining TV?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.292
No, it's important.
Come on, Kaz, please.

08:13.292 --> 08:14.458
<i>We'll get to hang out,</i>

08:14.458 --> 08:15.625
<i>we'll get to spend
some time together.</i>

08:15.625 --> 08:17.708
It'll be fun. Like old times.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.042
Old times? I just remember you

08:19.042 --> 08:20.958
and my sister constantly
trying to shake me off.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.000
<i>- Does that sound a bit weird?</i>

08:24.042 --> 08:25.542
Come on, please.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.417
Oh, God, Zoe, stop.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.583
<i>You owe me.</i>

08:28.583 --> 08:29.958
<i>I never told Aunty Aisha</i>

08:29.958 --> 08:31.250
<i>what you got up to
in that treehouse.</i>

08:32.042 --> 08:33.500
<i>All right.
Well, what about this?</i>

08:33.500 --> 08:35.707
<i>We'll meet up,
play a little table tennis.</i>

08:35.707 --> 08:37.832
<i>And if you beat me,
I'll think about it.</i>

08:37.832 --> 08:39.792
Yeah. Sounds good.
No pressure.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.417
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.542
I'm getting...
It's been a while

08:43.542 --> 08:45.083
since I've played this.

08:45.792 --> 08:49.375
Er, dare I ask?
What about love?

08:50.042 --> 08:52.375
It's just a different way
of getting there.

08:52.375 --> 08:53.750
You don't have
to start with love.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.042
You end with love. You know?

08:55.042 --> 08:56.125
And over time,

08:56.125 --> 08:58.500
you grow to love the person
you're with.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.833
Hmm. What?
Like Stockholm Syndrome?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.292
You know, my parents aren't
making me do this.

09:04.292 --> 09:06.583
No, I know.
That's why I'm so surprised.

09:08.292 --> 09:11.083
Do you know what the UK
divorce rate is? I found out.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.167
No. Er, 50%?

09:12.875 --> 09:14.667
- 55%.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.250
And guess what it is for
Arranged marriages? 6%. Boom.

09:18.833 --> 09:20.667
Thing is, Zoe,
I've seen it work.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.708
I want my kids to have
what I had. Stability.

09:22.708 --> 09:24.542
Marriage isn't just about
two people being in love.

09:24.542 --> 09:26.750
It's a bigger thing than that.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.667
It's about what's best
for children,

09:28.667 --> 09:30.542
and the whole family. Society.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.167
Just say all that weird,
old-fashioned,

09:32.167 --> 09:33.833
conventional shit on camera.

09:33.833 --> 09:35.708
- Fuck, that is so annoying.

09:36.792 --> 09:38.583
If I win this rally, right,

09:39.167 --> 09:40.833
you're doing the film.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.375
-  Yes!

09:42.375 --> 09:44.125
God.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.583
You know where we're going.
I just told you.

09:45.583 --> 09:46.708
I know. But just say it
for the camera.

09:46.708 --> 09:47.875
And look in my eyes.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.000
- What, down to you?
- Yeah, tell me.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.833
Can you give me two seconds?
It's literally just here.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.667
And how is this

09:54.667 --> 09:57.958
any different from, say,
dating apps?

09:58.500 --> 10:01.750
Well, I guess you could say
it's kind of like a bespoke,

10:01.750 --> 10:05.333
3D halal Tinder,
operated by your parents.

10:06.417 --> 10:07.875
<i>I'm Aisha Khan.</i>

10:07.875 --> 10:10.750
I'm the cultural consultant on
this very positive documentary

10:10.750 --> 10:12.292
- on arranged marriage.
Great.

10:12.292 --> 10:13.417
If you could just, um,

10:13.417 --> 10:14.833
- ignore the camera.
Hi, guys.

10:15.583 --> 10:18.917
<i>Salam aleikum.</i> Mo here.
Mo the matchmaker.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.250
And if you're looking for
a suitable match for your son,

10:21.250 --> 10:22.917
then you've come
to the right place.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.583
We do daughters as well.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.792
Again, just...
You can just pretend

10:25.792 --> 10:27.583
I'm not here.
Sorry, I'm invisible.

10:27.583 --> 10:30.417
Natural. Bring it down
a little bit. Sure, okay.

10:30.417 --> 10:31.542
Okay.

10:33.208 --> 10:36.458
So, platinum services,
they also include me

10:36.458 --> 10:38.333
checking out
the girl's family.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.792
Seeing that she's
from a good family home,

10:39.792 --> 10:40.417
nice, tidy, clean.

10:40.417 --> 10:42.375
Okay. So, guys, tell me,

10:42.375 --> 10:45.167
what kind of lovely lady
are we looking for today?

10:45.167 --> 10:47.917
Someone intelligent
and attractive

10:47.917 --> 10:49.792
and who I click with,
I suppose.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.958
People keep talking
about this click. You know?

10:51.958 --> 10:53.583
He needs a companion,
not a click.

10:53.583 --> 10:55.875
You know, just someone
who can tolerate my parents.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.917
You know, a girl
from the same background.

10:57.917 --> 11:00.250
Soft-spoken, long hair.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.583
Er, not too dark.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.625
Wheatish complexion,
at the most.

11:03.625 --> 11:04.958
Wheat, beige?

11:04.958 --> 11:06.583
Did you bring your
Pantone colour chart?

11:07.208 --> 11:08.875
Be serious about this, okay?

11:08.875 --> 11:11.500
Brother, have a look at these
and tell me what you think.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.750
- No photos?
- No photos yet.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.583
Think about it,
if she's too fit,

11:15.583 --> 11:17.458
then you won't know
if she's a good fit.

11:17.458 --> 11:18.875
You're gonna see the picture.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.875
Yeah. You're thinking
with your little...

11:20.875 --> 11:23.542
You need to be thinking
with your... Okay?

11:24.292 --> 11:25.833
So, religious observance.

11:25.833 --> 11:28.042
Do you want practising,
moderately practising?

11:28.042 --> 11:30.417
- Practising.
- Not too conservative.

11:30.417 --> 11:31.875
And beard or no beard?

11:31.875 --> 11:33.125
What?

11:34.208 --> 11:37.000
Uh, wrong list.
Sorry, give that back.

11:37.417 --> 11:38.542
Sorry.

11:38.542 --> 11:41.708
Um, okay, and modesty,
are we talking hijab?

11:41.708 --> 11:44.000
Are we talking niqab?
Are we talking jilbab?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.125
Niqab is not necessary.

11:45.125 --> 11:47.208
We are a modern family
after all.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.625
Okay. Now, do we want
a housewife kind of lady,

11:49.625 --> 11:50.958
or do we want career lady?

11:50.958 --> 11:53.125
Seriously, as long as
we're on the same wavelength,

11:53.125 --> 11:54.667
and we have things
in common...

11:54.667 --> 11:55.833
But not too ambitious,

11:55.833 --> 11:58.208
or too much into this, er,
women's lib.

11:59.417 --> 12:01.458
And, er, community?

12:01.917 --> 12:04.042
- Pakistani.
- We're open to any background.

12:04.042 --> 12:05.292
But they just said Pakistan.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.417
- As long as she's Muslim.
But not Indian.

12:07.417 --> 12:10.792
Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi.
All these are okay.

12:10.792 --> 12:12.208
- Sure, cool.
Actually, it would

12:12.208 --> 12:15.042
be best if she is a, you know,
Jalandhar KPK Pathan mix.

12:15.042 --> 12:16.750
This is getting kind of niche.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.583
Okay, and what's, er...
What's your education, bro?

12:18.583 --> 12:20.458
Bachelors in Biology.
Then medical school.

12:21.917 --> 12:22.708
- He's a doctor.
- Oof.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.000
Listen, top of the food chain.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.417
- See?
Easy.

12:25.417 --> 12:27.083
And any vices
I should know about?

12:27.083 --> 12:28.500
Any drinking, smoking?

12:28.500 --> 12:30.542
Dogging? S and M?
Anything like that?

12:30.542 --> 12:31.958
- None.
- No.

12:31.958 --> 12:32.750
Okay, Uncle, Aunty,

12:32.750 --> 12:34.500
I will find your son
a brilliant match.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.292
You don't worry about that.
Thank you very much.

12:36.292 --> 12:37.875
Thank you very much.

12:37.875 --> 12:38.833
No dogs, no pets.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.458
No, no. Dogging means
something... Don't worry.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.875
Cats are okay.
Cats?

12:42.875 --> 12:44.958
I'll write that down. "Cats".

12:46.333 --> 12:48.333
We met on our wedding day.

12:49.375 --> 12:51.542
My parents, you know,
they showed me her photograph

12:51.542 --> 12:53.917
and I said, "Okay, it's fine."

12:55.333 --> 12:56.583
My mother asked me,
but I said,

12:56.583 --> 13:00.000
"No, you choose.
So, later I can blame you."

13:01.000 --> 13:04.125
Her father was Deputy
Commissioner of the district,

13:04.125 --> 13:07.042
and my father was a doctor
in the same village.

13:07.042 --> 13:08.167
They were friends,

13:08.167 --> 13:09.792
so, they arranged
the marriage.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.125
I remember, on the wedding,

13:12.125 --> 13:15.083
we were sitting on the stage
and the lights went out.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.250
In Pakistan, there is
an electricity problem.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.750
And she got scared,

13:19.750 --> 13:21.125
so I leaned over to her
and said,

13:21.125 --> 13:23.042
"Don't worry, it's nothing."

13:25.167 --> 13:26.750
Then I felt okay.

13:27.292 --> 13:29.625
After that,
it was simple sailing.

13:31.292 --> 13:33.833
You know,
when the lights came on,

13:33.833 --> 13:35.875
I felt he was looking at me.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.375
She looked tip-top.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.000
I thought to myself,

13:43.000 --> 13:46.125
"They made
a first-class choice."

13:47.958 --> 13:50.250
<i>♪ Gone cold ♪</i>

13:51.542 --> 13:53.708
<i>♪ It's horrible weather ♪</i>

13:56.667 --> 13:58.083
<i>♪ It's gone stone cold ♪</i>

13:58.083 --> 14:02.000
<i>♪ And you know
we should've got it together ♪</i>

14:05.292 --> 14:07.083
<i>♪ Well, it's nice ♪</i>

14:08.708 --> 14:10.833
<i>♪ It's nice to be wanted ♪</i>

14:10.833 --> 14:13.250
What was wrong with him?
He looked nice.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.083
No!
- Him, him. Stop.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.042
He's hot enough
that I'll overlook

14:17.042 --> 14:18.542
that inspirational quote.

14:18.542 --> 14:21.208
"My mantra is..."

14:21.208 --> 14:22.750
No.

14:22.750 --> 14:25.083
"...you have
to endure the rain

14:25.083 --> 14:27.875
"if you want
to see the rainbow."

14:27.875 --> 14:29.167
What does that mean?

14:29.167 --> 14:31.042
It means I'll have to toss
a Viagra in his mouth

14:31.042 --> 14:32.167
- when he's talking.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.667
Daddy's home.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.167
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!

14:36.167 --> 14:37.625
What are you doing?

14:37.625 --> 14:39.958
I thought the one upside
to getting married

14:39.958 --> 14:41.500
is that you get
to let yourself go?

14:41.500 --> 14:42.917
Yeah, what's a Viagra?

14:42.917 --> 14:44.500
Aunty Zoe here, by any chance?

14:44.500 --> 14:46.208
I'll go read to the kids

14:46.208 --> 14:47.292
so you can enjoy
some alone time.

14:47.292 --> 14:50.375
Oh, shut up.
Nothing inappropriate, please!

14:50.375 --> 14:52.083
- Mmm-mmm. Never.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.333
Come on. Come here.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.708
Once upon a time...

14:57.125 --> 14:59.875
He can come and listen to me
on my shoulder.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.542
- Ready?
- Yes.

15:01.542 --> 15:03.458
Oh, come here, Maud.

15:03.458 --> 15:04.667
Once upon a time,

15:04.667 --> 15:07.458
there was a girl
and she met a frog.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.625
And he promised her

15:09.625 --> 15:11.958
"If you kiss me,

15:11.958 --> 15:14.625
"I'll turn into
a handsome prince."

15:16.000 --> 15:17.833
And
she said, "I'm not interested

15:17.833 --> 15:20.125
"in fixing anyone but myself.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.958
"And anyway,

15:21.958 --> 15:24.833
"I'd far rather have a cool,

15:24.833 --> 15:27.958
"talking frog
than a boring old prince."

15:27.958 --> 15:30.292
- That's not a good story.

15:30.292 --> 15:31.625
Do Cinderella.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.458
All right, I'll do Cinderella,
if you're in bed in

15:34.458 --> 15:37.250
five, four, three, two...

15:37.250 --> 15:38.583
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

15:38.583 --> 15:41.000
<i>Cinderella met
a handsome prince.</i>

15:41.917 --> 15:44.083
<i>And sometimes, kids,
you meet someone,</i>

15:44.083 --> 15:45.667
<i>and you know in a heartbeat</i>

15:45.667 --> 15:48.250
<i>that you want
to spend the rest of your life</i>

15:49.417 --> 15:50.583
<i>without them.</i>

15:52.833 --> 15:55.208
<i>Once upon another time,</i>

15:55.208 --> 15:56.458
<i>Cinderella met another prince.</i>

15:56.458 --> 15:58.542
- You can probably tell...
<i>Because in fairy tales,</i>

15:58.542 --> 16:00.708
<i>a heroine is incomplete
without one.</i>

16:00.708 --> 16:02.208
...how well I've done
out of everything,

16:02.208 --> 16:03.750
And do you know what?

16:03.750 --> 16:05.125
You'd be bloody right, actually.

16:05.125 --> 16:08.000
<i>And another prince.</i>

16:10.958 --> 16:13.250
<i>And he asked her to marry him.</i>

16:14.667 --> 16:16.167
<i>And she said,</i>

16:17.292 --> 16:18.375
<i>"No".</i>

16:19.083 --> 16:21.375
<i>Cinderella focused
on glass ceilings</i>

16:21.375 --> 16:22.708
<i>instead of glass slippers,</i>

16:22.708 --> 16:24.208
<i>which means she focused on work</i>

16:24.208 --> 16:28.208
<i>and realised she was fine
without a boring old prince.</i>

16:28.208 --> 16:29.667
<i>The End.</i>

16:34.625 --> 16:37.000
Check, one, two...

16:37.000 --> 16:39.750
<i>Asalam aleikum,</i>
brothers and sisters.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.750
Welcome to this very,

16:41.750 --> 16:44.125
very special Muslim
marriage event.

16:44.125 --> 16:47.083
I go by the name
of Mo the Matchmaker.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.417
And I'm here
to find you a match.

16:49.417 --> 16:53.417
We are gonna end the spinster
crisis together, guys.

16:53.417 --> 16:54.792
Come on.

16:54.792 --> 16:56.125
There's someone
out there for everyone.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.833
And we all have needs.

16:57.833 --> 17:01.125
Divorcees. Disabled people.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.542
Women over 30.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.083
Okay, brothers,

17:05.083 --> 17:06.208
you may now approach

17:06.208 --> 17:08.250
any sisters
that you like the look of.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.750
Good. Rotate. Very nice.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.000
Oh, look at that chemistry.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.666
We keep it halal, here.
We keep it halal.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.458
Be honest. You're not
gonna get what you want

17:15.458 --> 17:17.000
if you don't say
what you want.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.583
Guys, you want a good cook,
say you want your Nigella.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.166
Girls, you want the money man,

17:21.166 --> 17:22.708
say, "I'm looking
for my Elon Musk."

17:22.708 --> 17:25.000
Use your best lines.

17:25.666 --> 17:28.416
Now we are gonna
form a circle of ten.

17:28.416 --> 17:31.208
Five guys, five girls.
Chaperones at the back.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.250
Come on, guys, let's do it.

17:34.167 --> 17:35.875
Your parents are gonna be
so happy, trust me.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.667
Come on.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.333
And, guys,
I want you to be honest, okay?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.750
Is this your first time?

17:42.750 --> 17:46.250
Mate, here,
it's everyone's first time.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.042
At least that's what
they'll tell you.

17:48.833 --> 17:49.917
- Boys, boys, boys.

17:49.917 --> 17:52.083
What's going on? Why are you
talking to each other?

17:52.083 --> 17:53.792
There's girls here. Okay?

17:53.792 --> 17:56.250
Unless you want marriage
outside of Islamic sharia,

17:56.250 --> 17:58.167
I suggest you stop talking
to the same sex.

17:58.167 --> 17:59.958
All right, boys? Enjoy.

17:59.958 --> 18:02.042
I'm looking for someone
who has patience

18:02.042 --> 18:03.583
and an understanding
of culture.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.792
Someone who's supportive
and honest,

18:06.792 --> 18:07.917
who likes to travel.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.875
Well, just someone
who's great.

18:09.875 --> 18:11.583
And who's British enough
for me,

18:11.583 --> 18:13.583
and, er, Pakistani enough
for my family.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.583
Someone down to earth
with a sense of humour,

18:17.583 --> 18:19.583
who will encourage me
in my religion.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.458
Where are you from?

18:22.458 --> 18:24.333
Erm, Birmingham.
How about you?

18:24.333 --> 18:26.125
Well, I'm from...
Well, I'm from London.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.417
- What do you do?
- I'm a banker.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.625
- What do you do?
- I... Well, I'm a doctor.

18:36.417 --> 18:38.000
Oh, Kaz.

18:38.708 --> 18:41.208
Isn't this a massive,
crazy gamble?

18:41.208 --> 18:42.625
I mean...

18:43.083 --> 18:45.583
What if there's no chemistry?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.708
How are you even gonna know,

18:47.708 --> 18:49.125
if you don't believe in sex
before marriage

18:49.125 --> 18:50.542
all of a sudden?

18:50.542 --> 18:53.667
I'm not sure I believe in sex
after marriage.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.208
Most of my friends have
no sex after marriage.

18:56.208 --> 18:57.542
And that's with the loves
of their lives.

18:57.542 --> 19:00.500
That's a fair point.
It's depressing.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.333
I think you can usually tell

19:04.333 --> 19:06.083
if the sex would work.

19:12.167 --> 19:14.750
Do you wanna go
and get a drink?

19:14.750 --> 19:16.625
A Bloody Mary for me,
and a Virgin for you.

19:19.417 --> 19:21.042
I've got lunch
with my parents.

19:21.042 --> 19:23.292
- Oh.
- It's Mother's Day.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.000
Oh, shit.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.458
See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

19:32.708 --> 19:33.833
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.000
Hi, Zoe.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.333
Ah! <i>Allah kum salam,</i>
Aunty Aisha.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.583
- What?

19:49.583 --> 19:50.917
You still can't say it.
It's...

19:50.917 --> 19:52.542
<i>Asalam aleikum,</i> Aisha.

19:52.542 --> 19:53.625
There you go.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.167
That's exactly
what I just said.

19:55.167 --> 19:57.083
Happy Mother's Day.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.042
Wish I could say
the same to you.

19:59.042 --> 20:01.875
I was just saying I wish
I could say the same to her.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.458
<i>- Inshallah.</i>
Fat chance of that.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.708
I cannot, for the life of me,

20:06.708 --> 20:08.292
find my other
washing-up glove.

20:08.292 --> 20:10.417
And these are new.
I've looked everywhere.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.208
Gosh, hasn't Kazim
got so good...

20:12.208 --> 20:13.542
Where are you? Oh.

20:13.542 --> 20:15.375
...so good-looking?

20:15.375 --> 20:16.708
It's hardly surprising, is it?

20:16.708 --> 20:18.208
Look at his mother.
I mean, she...

20:18.208 --> 20:20.167
She's so elegant,
she could be Greek

20:20.167 --> 20:21.833
or Italian.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.750
The compliment
that's actually an insult.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.750
You wouldn't think
they were Muslims

20:26.750 --> 20:28.083
to look at them, would you?

20:28.083 --> 20:28.917
I don't know, Mum.

20:28.917 --> 20:31.375
What do 1.8 billion Muslims
all look like?

20:33.208 --> 20:35.125
- Careful.
- Just...

20:35.125 --> 20:36.833
We've been very lucky to
have them as neighbours.

20:36.833 --> 20:38.208
Actually, they've become
like family to me

20:38.208 --> 20:40.708
since your father left
for that teenaged whore.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.833
- She's 35.
- Exactly.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.167
Oh, is that Grindr?

20:44.167 --> 20:45.917
My hairdresser's
never off that.

20:45.917 --> 20:47.625
- Anyone we should meet?
- No.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.750
Oh, well, don't leave it
too late.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.875
Human eggs have
a sell-by date, too, you know.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.583
Maybe I'll freeze them.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.583
I could be a 90-year-old
pushing a triple pram.

20:57.583 --> 21:01.500
Well, that's no good to me,
is it? Because I'll be dead.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.875
Oh...

21:02.875 --> 21:04.292
How is your egg?

21:04.292 --> 21:06.375
It looks a bit raw.

21:06.375 --> 21:07.625
Mmm.

21:07.625 --> 21:11.333
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
My Marigold!

21:11.708 --> 21:13.250
That's where it got to.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.542
He eats your
washing-up gloves?

21:15.542 --> 21:16.750
He eats everything.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.792
At least now you can tell
which way round he is.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.542
Oh!

21:21.083 --> 21:23.042
I'm ringing
my lovely vet.

21:23.042 --> 21:24.458
You're going
to have to take him

21:24.458 --> 21:26.417
to James the vet
for me tomorrow.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.125
Why can't you take him?

21:28.125 --> 21:30.167
It's my day visiting cancer
patients at the Marsden.

21:30.167 --> 21:32.167
I can't. I've got
a really important meeting.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.167
It's the children's ward.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.958
He'll be fine.

21:35.958 --> 21:37.875
He's eaten my HRT patches
as well.

21:37.875 --> 21:38.917
He'll grow breasts.

21:38.917 --> 21:41.375
You'll grow breasts,
you silly dog.

21:41.375 --> 21:42.708
- It's not funny, ZoZo.

21:42.708 --> 21:44.083
It is funny, actually.

21:44.083 --> 21:47.042
James, it's me. I... Erm...

21:47.042 --> 21:49.208
It's the dog. I can't explain,

21:49.208 --> 21:50.792
but something
is hanging out of him

21:51.375 --> 21:53.125
at the wrong end.

21:55.417 --> 21:56.458
How's it going then, boy?

21:56.458 --> 21:57.875
Did you find
your missus today?

21:57.875 --> 21:58.833
Don't start with me, man.

21:58.833 --> 22:00.417
I knew you were gonna start
with me today.

22:00.417 --> 22:01.792
- Let me just enjoy my...
Anyone good?

22:03.333 --> 22:05.875
There was no one
I clicked with. There was...

22:05.875 --> 22:07.333
Click and collect.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.208
<i>Ammi,</i> come on.
There has to be a spark.

22:11.208 --> 22:13.625
- There wasn't even a flicker.
- You know what I say.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.375
Simmer first, then boil.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.458
You all want to boil first,
then simmer.

22:19.458 --> 22:21.583
And when it cools down,
you get disappointed,

22:21.583 --> 22:22.917
and throw out the chai.

22:22.917 --> 22:24.125
Yeah, well,
simmer for too long,

22:24.125 --> 22:25.417
you end up with a dry pot.

22:25.417 --> 22:27.333
No-one likes a dry pot, bro.

22:28.625 --> 22:30.125
He threw
the thing at me, tell him off.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.833
The problem is, people have
too many options.

22:34.208 --> 22:36.625
The distant drum
sounds more exciting.

22:37.542 --> 22:40.333
Did you tell him
about the girl

22:40.333 --> 22:41.958
that Mo <i>bhai</i> rang about, huh?

22:42.833 --> 22:45.417
There's a very nice girl
in Lahore.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.750
Convent educated,
excellent family.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.875
Height is okay, five foot two.

22:49.875 --> 22:52.083
If she were five foot,
I would hesitate.

22:52.083 --> 22:53.208
Why wasn't I told?

22:53.208 --> 22:55.000
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.917
Supposed to have
a very good nature.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.792
What am I gonna have in common
with someone from Pakistan?

22:58.792 --> 23:00.208
Besides culture, religion,

23:00.208 --> 23:01.875
language, colour,
family, genes.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.125
Should I go on?

23:03.125 --> 23:05.042
Yeah, think about it. And your
surname will be the same.

23:05.042 --> 23:06.500
She's a Khan?

23:06.500 --> 23:09.167
Passport, credit cards.
No change.

23:09.167 --> 23:11.375
But she's not a relation?

23:11.375 --> 23:13.750
No. But nothing wrong
with that.

23:13.750 --> 23:16.167
You know, Victoria and Albert
were first cousins.

23:16.167 --> 23:17.583
And they had a museum
named after them!

23:17.583 --> 23:18.833
Okay, yeah, I know.

23:18.833 --> 23:19.917
Listen, we are meeting

23:19.917 --> 23:21.583
the family over Skype
this evening.

23:21.583 --> 23:23.208
You see if you like her.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.375
Please.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.958
Okay. Don't.

23:29.958 --> 23:31.833
Our parents
both knew each other.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.125
They wanted us to meet.

23:33.125 --> 23:35.083
But we were both like, "Nah".

23:35.083 --> 23:36.917
"No way".

23:37.333 --> 23:39.000
- Sorry, sorry.
- Okay.

23:40.500 --> 23:43.250
Then I saw him at Rumi's Cave.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.083
It's like
this cultural centre.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.042
And we were both part
of the Muslim archery club.

23:47.042 --> 23:48.167
But we never spoke.

23:48.167 --> 23:51.042
- She was on Minder.
- But he was on Muzmatch.

23:51.042 --> 23:53.083
So we were on different paths.

23:53.083 --> 23:56.458
But we were on the same team
for the Muslim muggles quiz.

23:56.792 --> 23:58.417
It's for Harry Potter fans,

23:58.417 --> 24:01.042
looking at Islamic values
in the series.

24:01.042 --> 24:04.083
- And we identified loads.
- And we won!

24:04.500 --> 24:06.167
Team Hufflepuff!

24:06.583 --> 24:08.750
So, then, after that,
we agreed to meet.

24:09.250 --> 24:12.000
And I remember saying
to myself, you know,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.875
"You wander from room
to room sometimes

24:13.875 --> 24:15.583
"looking for the diamond

24:15.583 --> 24:17.625
"that's already
around your own neck."

24:18.167 --> 24:19.375
Rūmī.

24:25.875 --> 24:26.875
Okay.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.000
Er, hi.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.083
<i>Hi.</i>

24:40.750 --> 24:43.375
Maymouna.
That's a very lovely name.

24:43.375 --> 24:44.500
It's very beautiful.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.167
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:47.708 --> 24:50.375
Are you named
after anyone in your family?

24:50.833 --> 24:52.083
<i>Mmm.</i>

24:52.083 --> 24:53.333
<i>No.</i>

24:54.125 --> 24:56.500
<i>I think my parents
just liked it.</i>

24:57.625 --> 24:59.125
Great. That's...

24:59.500 --> 25:01.167
You're... You're studying law?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
<i>Yes.</i>

25:04.000 --> 25:05.750
Well, I thought
about doing law.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.875
But then I didn't.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.333
<i>Do you have any siblings?</i>

25:12.333 --> 25:15.792
I have a brother
who lives here with his wife.

25:15.792 --> 25:17.583
And a sister.

25:18.833 --> 25:21.083
I have one brother, and, um,

25:22.417 --> 25:23.375
and...

25:32.458 --> 25:35.167
My sister lives
in the Northern Areas.

25:35.750 --> 25:38.208
Her husband is posted there.

25:38.208 --> 25:39.417
<i>The roof of the world.</i>

25:39.417 --> 25:41.833
<i>That's my favourite place
on earth.</i>

25:42.417 --> 25:44.292
I haven't
been there yet, but...

25:44.292 --> 25:45.583
<i>I remember the first time
I went.</i>

25:45.583 --> 25:47.000
Um...

25:47.000 --> 25:48.167
My grandfather took me.

25:48.167 --> 25:51.083
That was his favourite place
as well. And, um...

25:51.083 --> 25:52.417
I was just a little boy,

25:52.417 --> 25:54.125
and I'd wandered off
and got lost,

25:54.125 --> 25:57.500
and it was weird,
I wasn't scared. It was...

25:58.250 --> 26:01.167
It was the first time
I felt connected

26:01.167 --> 26:03.333
to something bigger
than myself, you know?

26:03.833 --> 26:05.667
Bigger than
my own fear, and...

26:06.208 --> 26:07.250
My grandfather gave me

26:07.250 --> 26:08.958
a tight slap when he found me,
though.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.375
That's still the place I feel
closest to God. Definitely.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.583
<i>And to my grandfather.</i>

26:17.583 --> 26:20.500
How do you feel about possibly
moving to London?

26:20.500 --> 26:23.042
- Um...
- She's fine with it.

26:23.042 --> 26:24.542
She will love London.

26:24.542 --> 26:25.875
It's a very multi-cultural
place.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.458
Full of Pakistanis.

26:27.458 --> 26:32.042
It's like
living in a giant brothel.

26:32.042 --> 26:33.083
I'm sorry about this.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.333
<i>- This is my big brother.</i>
- It's okay.

26:34.333 --> 26:35.458
- Farooq.
- He gives me pocket money.

26:35.458 --> 26:36.500
It's normal.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.875
They take their dogs to dinner

26:38.875 --> 26:41.667
and leave their children
at home.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.125
Don't mind her.

26:44.667 --> 26:46.250
Very nice.
- Yeah.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.417
What's he been eating
this time?

26:53.417 --> 26:55.375
- Mum's HRT patches.
- Ah.

26:55.375 --> 26:56.583
And her washing-up glove.

26:56.583 --> 26:59.750
Last time,
it was her pop socks.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.042
Oh, God.
He's like a fluffy Pac-Man.

27:02.042 --> 27:03.167
Let's take a look at him,

27:03.167 --> 27:04.250
- shall we?
- Mmm.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.375
If you could just hold him
nice and still.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.333
Okay. Come on, Barney.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.458
- Oh.
- There you go.

27:09.458 --> 27:10.625
- Oh, I'm just gonna...
- Sorry.

27:10.625 --> 27:12.542
-  Sorry.
- Sorry.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.375
Sorry. Does he
come here often?

27:14.375 --> 27:17.958
So often, I know all his
deepest, darkest secrets.

27:17.958 --> 27:20.250
And even some of yours.

27:20.250 --> 27:22.750
No, I'm kidding.
I'm just kidding.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.875
- But your mum has told me...

27:24.875 --> 27:26.875
- ...all about you, though.
- Oh, God.

27:26.875 --> 27:29.083
Film school in London.

27:29.083 --> 27:32.750
Two documentaries.
And a <i>Radio Times</i>

27:32.750 --> 27:33.833
Viewers' and Listeners' Award.

27:33.833 --> 27:36.750
- She gave you my actual CV.
- And your complete works.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.708
- I'm so sorry.
-  Don't worry.

27:38.708 --> 27:40.000
I haven't had a chance
to watch them yet,

27:40.000 --> 27:41.250
but they do look really,
really great.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.917
Now, this guy
is gonna be just fine.

27:43.917 --> 27:45.083
If he hasn't passed them
by Friday,

27:45.083 --> 27:47.292
bring him back in,
we'll get him X-rayed.

27:47.542 --> 27:49.000
- Okay.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.708
Thanks.
Come on, you silly dog.

27:51.708 --> 27:52.833
Good to see you again, Barney.

27:52.833 --> 27:54.125
And, um, it's lovely to

27:54.125 --> 27:56.375
meet you, too,
for the first time, Zoe.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.000
And you.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.333
If you ever felt
like going out

27:59.333 --> 28:01.917
to get a drink or something, sometime,

28:01.917 --> 28:03.625
- we could...
- Thank you.

28:03.625 --> 28:05.125
I'm a bit snowed under
with work

28:05.125 --> 28:06.417
- at the moment.
- Yeah, sure.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.708
Just 'cause your mum said
that you... But never mind.

28:08.708 --> 28:09.917
Um...

28:10.292 --> 28:12.417
- Let me get the door for you.
- Yeah.

28:12.417 --> 28:14.542
Thank you. Sorry about that.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.292
- Ta-da!
- Er, mmm...

28:17.167 --> 28:19.000
- Uh, look after that guy.
- I will, thanks.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.125
- Thanks so much.
- And let me know

28:20.125 --> 28:21.458
if your workload...

28:22.125 --> 28:23.208
eases.

28:23.708 --> 28:25.250
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

28:25.250 --> 28:27.875
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Mum ♪</i>

28:27.875 --> 28:29.375
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

28:29.375 --> 28:30.458
<i>Thank you!</i>

28:30.458 --> 28:31.750
I can't actually
talk right now

28:31.750 --> 28:33.833
because I'm about to, um...
I'm about to go and

28:33.833 --> 28:36.958
put some grand eggs on ice
for your birthday present.

28:36.958 --> 28:38.083
<i>Ooh!</i>

28:38.083 --> 28:39.167
Yeah. So, you can stop

28:39.167 --> 28:40.833
setting me up
with total strangers.

28:40.833 --> 28:43.417
<i>What a wonderful
birthday present.</i>

28:43.417 --> 28:44.875
Would you like them
gift wrapped?

28:46.125 --> 28:48.958
Is there an express service?

28:48.958 --> 28:50.625
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

28:50.625 --> 28:51.875
Just come in here
on your lunch break.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.583
And then in your 60s,

28:53.583 --> 28:55.500
we defrost your baby.

28:57.625 --> 28:58.917
No.

28:59.625 --> 29:00.708
No.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.500
Egg harvest.

29:02.833 --> 29:04.958
Yeah. Sounds festive, huh?
It's not.

29:06.083 --> 29:08.792
Listen, how much
do you want to be a mother?

29:08.792 --> 29:10.750
Mmm. Well,
I'd rather be a father.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.167
Then you don't have

29:12.167 --> 29:13.292
- to juggle everything.
- Yeah.

29:14.958 --> 29:16.625
No, I, um...

29:18.083 --> 29:20.000
Of course,
I want to be a mother.

29:20.542 --> 29:22.125
I just...

29:22.125 --> 29:25.833
You know, I want to find
the right person. And not yet.

29:26.708 --> 29:27.708
That's why I'm here.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.917
I keep seeing all these women
in their 50s having babies.

29:30.917 --> 29:32.708
So, that's gotta be
frozen eggs, right?

29:32.708 --> 29:34.625
Ah. The same women
that have, like,

29:34.625 --> 29:36.833
really nice skin
and no eye bags

29:36.833 --> 29:38.625
because they use
the right moisturiser?

29:39.083 --> 29:40.708
Yeah, highly unlikely.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.708
Do you know the success rate
for frozen eggs?

29:42.708 --> 29:43.792
Well, I know

29:43.792 --> 29:45.167
- it's not a guarantee.

29:45.167 --> 29:46.792
No.

29:46.792 --> 29:47.833
It's...

29:48.583 --> 29:49.625
1%.

29:49.625 --> 29:53.500
1% of frozen eggs
result in a live birth.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.375
Really?

29:55.375 --> 29:57.625
But much better odds
for frozen embryos.

29:58.958 --> 30:00.208
- Okay.

30:00.208 --> 30:03.208
Um, how do I freeze
an embryo, then?

30:03.208 --> 30:04.917
Just come in with a partner.

30:04.917 --> 30:06.875
Or, you know,
pick a sperm donor.

30:06.875 --> 30:10.000
Or just find a nice
gay friend. That's...

30:10.000 --> 30:11.583
I don't have a partner.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.333
I thought that was the whole
point of this egg freezing,

30:13.333 --> 30:16.167
is that I don't have to put
all my eggs in one bastard.

30:21.625 --> 30:24.500
He texted me instead of her
by mistake.

30:27.375 --> 30:29.875
- Who is she?
- Someone in his office.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.750
I should have known.

30:32.250 --> 30:33.458
He kept not remembering

30:33.458 --> 30:34.542
- her name.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.333
- Hang on.

30:42.750 --> 30:45.458
Where are you going?
That's not him, is it?

30:45.458 --> 30:47.250
Can you deal with the kids?

30:50.208 --> 30:51.958
Oh, my God.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.292
Once upon a time,

31:01.292 --> 31:04.042
there was a girl called
Little Red Riding Hood.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.875
<i>She'd had a bad week.</i>

31:07.667 --> 31:10.083
<i>And all she wanted
was to feel better.</i>

31:11.833 --> 31:14.375
<i>Or to feel nothing.</i>

31:22.958 --> 31:26.167
<i>So, when her mother warned her
not to stray off that path,</i>

31:26.167 --> 31:28.208
<i>and talk to any strangers</i>

31:28.208 --> 31:30.625
<i>Little Red Riding Hood
thought to herself,</i>

31:31.333 --> 31:34.000
<i>"Where's the fun
on a well-trodden path?"</i>

31:34.250 --> 31:37.417
<i>And of course, she met a wolf.</i>

31:39.625 --> 31:41.042
<i>In an instant,</i>

31:41.042 --> 31:45.333
<i>all those bad feelings
disappeared, like magic.</i>

31:47.125 --> 31:48.958
<i>"What's the worst
that could happen?"</i>

31:48.958 --> 31:50.458
<i>she thought to herself.</i>

31:54.583 --> 31:57.417
<i>"So, a bad boy wolf
wants to eat me?</i>

31:59.667 --> 32:02.458
<i>"A little nibble here
and there can't hurt.</i>

32:04.250 --> 32:05.583
<i>"Can it?"</i>

32:31.083 --> 32:32.958
I was in the shower.

32:32.958 --> 32:34.000
Yeah.

32:34.958 --> 32:35.625
Yeah.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.083
Mmm-hmm.

32:41.708 --> 32:43.625
Sorry. Yeah, I, um...

32:43.917 --> 32:46.250
I fell asleep with my phone
on silent.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.750
- Ooh!

33:22.542 --> 33:25.083
- Man down.
Ah, come on. Bloody sub .

33:27.625 --> 33:28.750
You're on.

33:32.125 --> 33:33.208
Did you get the goal,
at least?

33:33.208 --> 33:35.375
No, I just got you going
down like a skittle.

33:35.375 --> 33:36.458
Great.

33:36.917 --> 33:39.417
That looked painful. Oh.

33:40.292 --> 33:41.583
Hang on,
let me just get this mic on.

33:41.583 --> 33:44.000
I've definitely
pulled something.

33:46.375 --> 33:47.375
So...

33:48.625 --> 33:50.250
What was...

33:50.250 --> 33:51.708
- What was so urgent?
- I, er...

33:51.708 --> 33:53.875
- I've got news.
- Yeah?

33:54.500 --> 33:56.042
I'm, er...

33:56.458 --> 33:58.333
I, er... I got engaged.

34:00.250 --> 34:01.333
Wait, what?

34:01.333 --> 34:03.875
Yeah, I know. It's crazy,
right? But we've...

34:05.042 --> 34:06.708
been talking quite a lot.

34:07.875 --> 34:10.125
And been texting and FaceTime.

34:10.125 --> 34:12.042
And we keep talking.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.250
I really like her.

34:17.250 --> 34:20.250
And the wedding's not for
a whole 'nother month, so...

34:20.250 --> 34:22.292
- A month?
- Yeah, I know.

34:22.292 --> 34:24.625
My mum's already handed out
sweets to the whole street.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.333
- It's love at first Skype.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.542
Well, obviously not, no.

34:27.542 --> 34:29.958
Love at first anything's
a mental health issue.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.708
So, um, how old is she again?

34:31.708 --> 34:33.917
Willmore, track! Willmore!

34:35.875 --> 34:38.625
- 22.
Leaving the party early.

34:38.625 --> 34:40.000
Not worried about the age gap?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.833
I knew you were
gonna ask that.

34:41.833 --> 34:43.375
No, she's super smart.

34:43.375 --> 34:47.042
And you reckon that you have
enough in common?

34:47.042 --> 34:48.417
Well, we will have.

34:48.417 --> 34:49.542
She gets it.

34:49.542 --> 34:50.833
She understands
how it all works.

34:50.833 --> 34:51.917
You know, she wants to be

34:51.917 --> 34:52.917
- a human rights lawyer.
- Wow.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.583
Sorry.

34:55.583 --> 34:57.500
I'm just taking it all in. Um...

34:57.500 --> 35:00.125
So you really will be
marrying a stranger.

35:01.417 --> 35:03.292
I guess, in the end,
so is everyone else.

35:03.958 --> 35:05.667
Everyone turns out to be
someone else,

35:05.667 --> 35:07.125
or fucking someone else.

35:07.125 --> 35:08.708
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

35:08.708 --> 35:10.250
Can you turn the thing
on the...

35:10.250 --> 35:11.333
No, no, no. Sorry. Sorry.

35:11.333 --> 35:12.375
Zoe, off!

35:14.750 --> 35:16.000
What's up?

35:22.375 --> 35:23.875
Uh, sorry.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.417
Oh, it's just been
a challenging week.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.167
What? Another date with
someone you already hate?

35:36.333 --> 35:38.667
What you need is a holiday.

35:38.667 --> 35:40.000
Yeah.

35:41.458 --> 35:42.875
In Lahore.

35:45.958 --> 35:47.292
Mmm.

35:49.125 --> 35:50.375
Oh, darling.

35:50.375 --> 35:52.875
Just in time for a quick bite
before we leave.

35:52.875 --> 35:55.167
Great. Oh, sorry. Eggs again?

35:55.167 --> 35:57.208
No, no, no. Omelettes.

35:57.958 --> 35:58.958
Come on.

35:58.958 --> 36:02.375
Ooh, now in there
is a little care package

36:02.375 --> 36:03.500
I've put together for us.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.250
Just the basics.
Imodium, HobNobs, rape alarm.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.000
Is Barney joining us?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.083
Don't be silly.
Although, um...

36:11.083 --> 36:12.792
No, James is coming
to pick him up

36:12.792 --> 36:14.042
- and I thought that... Ooh!

36:14.042 --> 36:16.167
There he is. I thought
he might like to join us

36:16.167 --> 36:18.958
for a little... Little lunch.

36:18.958 --> 36:20.208
- James!
Hi.

36:20.208 --> 36:21.875
My favourite
dog whisperer.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.125
Oh, come in.

36:24.125 --> 36:26.250
Zoe. You remember James,
don't you?

36:26.250 --> 36:28.542
James delivered
your pop socks. Hi.

36:28.542 --> 36:30.375
Talking of which...

36:30.375 --> 36:33.083
- So, how have you been?
- Oh, you know, saving lives.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.375
A gerbil, a cat,

36:34.375 --> 36:37.708
octogenarian tortoise
who's making a slow recovery.

36:39.542 --> 36:41.333
- Sorry.
- He's so funny.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.042
He's so... He's so funny.

36:43.042 --> 36:44.292
Why don't you just sit,

36:44.292 --> 36:46.833
and have a chat
while I cook the toast?

36:46.833 --> 36:48.708
So, you're off to
a fancy wedding

36:48.708 --> 36:50.875
- in Pakistan, I hear?
- Yeah.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.333
I've never missed
a Khan wedding,

36:52.333 --> 36:54.375
and I can't wait
to wear a burkini

36:54.375 --> 36:56.417
- on the subcontinent.
- Wow.

36:56.417 --> 36:59.458
Except for Lahore
is nowhere near the sea.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.125
Well, you never know
where we might end up.

37:01.125 --> 37:02.542
And when we come back,

37:02.542 --> 37:03.833
we should have dinner
with James.

37:03.833 --> 37:05.083
We'll get Helena
and Harry over.

37:05.083 --> 37:06.583
Helena is Zoe's
very good friend.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.458
She's married
to a lovely man called Harry.

37:08.458 --> 37:09.583
Who's been having an affair.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.167
- Harry?
- Yes.

37:11.167 --> 37:12.750
- No? I can't believe it.
- Yes!

37:12.750 --> 37:14.375
I'm pretty sure most
married men would cheat

37:14.375 --> 37:15.792
if they could get away
with it.

37:15.792 --> 37:16.875
James wouldn't.

37:18.208 --> 37:20.750
Even if you're sure
your wife would never know?

37:20.750 --> 37:22.042
No, of course not.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.042
Why not?

37:25.042 --> 37:26.417
Because I'd know.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.875
Bon appétit.

37:32.875 --> 37:33.958
Mmm.

37:33.958 --> 37:35.375
- Wait a minute, pet.

37:35.375 --> 37:36.708
Oh!

37:36.708 --> 37:38.125
So, erm...

37:39.292 --> 37:40.500
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Hello!

37:40.500 --> 37:42.167
You're early.
Why are you so early?

37:42.167 --> 37:43.333
Flight doesn't leave
for hours.

37:43.333 --> 37:44.458
I know. I know. We just need

37:44.458 --> 37:45.958
to allow extra time
for security.

37:45.958 --> 37:47.083
Why?

37:47.083 --> 37:49.125
So, I can be
randomly selected.

37:49.833 --> 37:51.333
Oh! Oh.

37:51.792 --> 37:52.875
Oh...

37:52.875 --> 37:54.833
Well, that's a shame.

37:54.833 --> 37:55.917
James was about to tell us

37:55.917 --> 37:57.042
something

37:57.042 --> 37:58.125
- absolutely hilarious.

37:58.125 --> 38:01.333
Look who's here.
He says we've got to go.

38:01.333 --> 38:04.042
Sorry, Mum, that your enormous
efforts have gone to waste.

38:04.042 --> 38:07.125
But, you know, we've got
a plane to catch, and...

38:07.125 --> 38:08.250
Kaz, the doctor...

38:08.250 --> 38:09.333
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:09.333 --> 38:10.458
...meet James the vet.

38:10.458 --> 38:12.917
I've heard all about you.
Good luck with the wedding.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.542
- Thank you.
- Oh. Barney. Barney.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.042
- Mummy go shopping.

38:16.042 --> 38:17.167
Mummy go shopping.

38:17.167 --> 38:18.833
Don't tell Barney that
I'm off to Lahore,

38:18.833 --> 38:19.917
because he'll get...

38:19.917 --> 38:22.958
Shopping. Shopping.
Stay. Shopping. Stay. Stay.

38:22.958 --> 38:24.250
Let me help you
with the cases.

38:24.250 --> 38:25.417
No, I'll get them.

38:25.417 --> 38:27.750
Well, I'm looking forward
to hearing how it all goes.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.375
- Yeah, you, too.
- Great. Well...

38:29.375 --> 38:31.000
-  Oh...
- I mean, thanks.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.708
- Great. Yeah.
- Bye. Bye.

38:33.458 --> 38:35.500
Oh, James.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.917
I am so sorry
that we've got to go. But...

38:38.917 --> 38:41.875
Well, I'll FaceTime you both
from Pakistan

38:41.875 --> 38:44.042
or, or...

38:44.958 --> 38:47.208
Cover my FaceTime.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.708
You set me off.

38:49.708 --> 38:52.250
Keep that, just in case
you might want to go shopping.

38:52.250 --> 38:55.292
Bye. Darling, bye.
Eat the omelettes.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.417
- Okay. Yeah.
- Bye. Bye.

38:57.417 --> 38:58.500
Bye!

39:01.792 --> 39:02.792
Barney.

39:09.208 --> 39:12.792
And this is her in
the nativity play where...

39:12.792 --> 39:14.458
You don't know
what that is,

39:14.458 --> 39:16.000
but I'll explain later.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.458
Her when she was
a little baby.

39:17.458 --> 39:18.875
She was only three months old.

39:28.125 --> 39:29.625
Are you all right?

39:31.542 --> 39:33.625
It's thought field therapy.
It's, er...

39:34.458 --> 39:35.792
...a technique.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.792
I don't like flying.

39:43.292 --> 39:45.125
Even the lingo's morbid.
It's what?

39:45.125 --> 39:47.125
"Final destination".
"Departed".

39:48.417 --> 39:50.542
Or "Terminal".

39:52.167 --> 39:53.667
Some nuts, sir?
- Thank you.

39:53.667 --> 39:54.625
You're welcome.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.750
Who was that guy
at your mum's house?

39:58.750 --> 40:00.292
Mmm.

40:01.333 --> 40:03.792
If I were Pakistani,
he'd be my arranged husband.

40:05.333 --> 40:08.167
- Sounds ideal.
- Except that he's not my type.

40:09.625 --> 40:11.458
- What is your type?
-  Oh!

40:13.042 --> 40:15.208
- But is that wrong?
- Yeah.

40:15.208 --> 40:17.833
Uh, don't know.

40:22.083 --> 40:23.833
Can I ask you a question?

40:26.667 --> 40:29.708
Would you cheat if you knew
you'd never get caught?

40:29.708 --> 40:32.542
Be honest.
If your wife would never know.

40:32.542 --> 40:33.583
No.

40:34.542 --> 40:35.875
Why not?

40:37.625 --> 40:38.667
Well, he'd know.

40:40.208 --> 40:41.583
Oh.

40:43.458 --> 40:45.667
- He's listening.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.250
Aren't they
desperately uncomfortable

41:02.250 --> 41:03.417
covered up like that
in this heat

41:03.417 --> 41:04.792
except for their eyes?

41:04.792 --> 41:07.625
No, not as uncomfortable
as those poor women

41:07.625 --> 41:10.083
who are uncovered
except for their eyes.

41:10.083 --> 41:12.542
Like on <i>Love Island.</i>
You see, Cath,

41:12.542 --> 41:14.375
our women are valued
for what's on the inside.

41:14.375 --> 41:16.917
Which is why we don't have
plastic surgery

41:16.917 --> 41:18.042
and anorexia,

41:18.042 --> 41:19.833
and all these
Western diseases.

41:19.833 --> 41:21.125
Well, I suppose a burka's

41:21.125 --> 41:23.042
wonderfully forgiving,
isn't it?

41:25.208 --> 41:26.625
A rupee for your thoughts?

41:43.583 --> 41:46.500
Oh, it's even better
with my sunglasses off.

41:49.042 --> 41:51.292
What a beautiful hall.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.875
I'm not trying
to upset you.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.583
We can't go on like this.

41:57.583 --> 42:00.500
You know this has caused me
the greatest pain in my life.

42:00.500 --> 42:02.625
And that of
your grandmother, too.

42:02.625 --> 42:05.708
Then, there's nothing
we can do about it.

42:06.542 --> 42:07.542
Okay.

42:11.875 --> 42:13.292
I'm so proud of you.

42:14.250 --> 42:16.833
Let's not spoil
this happy occasion.

42:16.833 --> 42:19.292
They met on their wedding day.

42:19.292 --> 42:22.042
He came to her village
on a white horse

42:22.042 --> 42:23.750
to take her away
from her home.

42:24.417 --> 42:27.583
In youth,
even a crow looks princely.

42:28.208 --> 42:30.208
Er, like a charming prince.

42:30.208 --> 42:32.250
I was allergic to horses.

42:32.625 --> 42:35.375
And they rode off together.

42:36.208 --> 42:38.333
And did they
fall in love?

42:38.333 --> 42:41.458
Fall in love,
lose your peace.

42:42.583 --> 42:45.083
You know,
we always say, it is, uh,

42:46.208 --> 42:50.792
better to fall into like,
and walk into love.

42:52.458 --> 42:53.667
It was a good match.

42:55.583 --> 42:56.833
It was a good match.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.375
<i>- Asalam o aleikum.
- Waleikum salam.</i>

43:10.375 --> 43:12.167
<i>- Asalam o aleikum.
- Waleikum.</i>

43:37.792 --> 43:39.833
<i>- Asalam o aleikum.
- Waleikum salam.</i>

43:42.167 --> 43:45.458
What a beautiful girl!

43:46.458 --> 43:48.542
Thank you.

43:49.208 --> 43:51.125
Pleased to meet you
in person, finally.

43:52.083 --> 43:53.667
Thank you.

43:59.333 --> 44:01.542
How are your studies going?

44:01.542 --> 44:02.625
Good.

44:03.667 --> 44:04.833
Good.

44:04.833 --> 44:07.708
Um, I was thinking
we could maybe

44:07.708 --> 44:10.083
do something together
this evening.

44:40.750 --> 44:43.208
We met on Skype.

44:43.208 --> 44:44.917
Um...

44:44.917 --> 44:46.417
I thought she was...

44:47.167 --> 44:50.250
You know, attractive,
obviously. And intelligent.

44:50.708 --> 44:52.542
Full of life.

44:53.625 --> 44:56.000
I don't know
what you thought of me.

44:56.750 --> 45:00.250
I thought he seemed
nice and reasonable.

45:01.917 --> 45:03.583
That's great. Um...

45:04.708 --> 45:06.500
Can you tell me

45:06.500 --> 45:08.542
how... How did you propose?

45:09.083 --> 45:10.083
Um...

45:11.125 --> 45:13.292
Well, actually, my...

45:14.333 --> 45:16.500
parents proposed
to her parents.

45:19.333 --> 45:21.167
It must have been

45:21.583 --> 45:23.750
daunting for you, Maymouna,

45:24.375 --> 45:26.708
deciding whether
to spend the rest of your life

45:26.708 --> 45:28.708
with someone you hardly know.

45:29.292 --> 45:30.292
Mmm.

45:31.667 --> 45:33.750
If my parents are comfortable
with their decision,

45:33.750 --> 45:35.125
I'm okay with it.

45:35.125 --> 45:36.917
And we talked a load
on the phone.

45:36.917 --> 45:38.917
And then we got
to know each other.

45:40.667 --> 45:43.417
Can you sum up
how you both feel?

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Good.

45:46.292 --> 45:48.458
Feels... Feels
like the timing's right.

45:50.375 --> 45:51.542
And...

45:53.250 --> 45:55.833
Can you see yourselves
falling in love?

45:56.917 --> 45:58.625
Yes, <i>inshallah.</i>

45:59.333 --> 46:01.167
Whatever "in love" means.

46:04.167 --> 46:05.167
Hmm.

46:22.792 --> 46:24.000
Did he remember you
from when you were a kid?

46:24.000 --> 46:25.333
- Yeah, that's family...
- Well?

46:25.333 --> 46:27.750
- Hey, morning.
- Where are you going?

46:27.750 --> 46:29.625
You haven't even
had breakfast.

46:29.625 --> 46:31.000
I need to go to the tailor.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.083
Then I was gonna take Zoe
to Anarkali bazaar.

46:33.083 --> 46:34.167
You're gonna love it.

46:34.167 --> 46:35.667
It's a massive bazaar

46:35.667 --> 46:37.500
named after
a beautiful dancing girl.

46:37.500 --> 46:40.167
Who was buried alive
by Emperor Akbar

46:40.167 --> 46:42.833
because she was an unsuitable
match for his son.

46:44.125 --> 46:46.042
Buried alive.

46:46.042 --> 46:47.458
I'll see you later.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.708
Yasmin. Take this
for Nani Jan.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.250
I can't believe you said...

47:18.958 --> 47:20.875
"Whatever love means".

47:20.875 --> 47:22.042
Huh?

47:22.042 --> 47:24.500
That's what Prince Charles
famously said

47:24.500 --> 47:26.250
when he got engaged to Diana.

47:26.958 --> 47:29.208
I thought
that sounded familiar.

47:29.208 --> 47:30.917
They basically had
an arranged marriage.

47:30.917 --> 47:32.333
Yeah.

47:32.333 --> 47:33.833
That worked out really well.

47:33.833 --> 47:37.000
Princess Diana wanted
to marry a Pakistani man.

47:38.042 --> 47:40.708
- Doctor Hasnat Khan.
- Doctor Khan.

47:41.625 --> 47:44.125
- Mother said no.
- What happened to him?

47:44.125 --> 47:46.208
He had an arranged marriage.

47:46.208 --> 47:48.000
Lived happily enough
ever after?

47:49.000 --> 47:50.583
Got divorced.

47:50.917 --> 47:53.167
He'd become too much Western.

48:03.042 --> 48:04.708
Okay, question.

48:04.708 --> 48:07.333
What did you think of her?
In real life?

48:08.667 --> 48:11.583
- She's great.
- Yeah, but, um,

48:11.583 --> 48:13.083
did you fancy her?

48:13.083 --> 48:16.167
Zoe, please. Do I have to say
that on camera? Come on.

48:16.167 --> 48:17.958
- So annoying.
- Fine.

48:17.958 --> 48:21.542
And are you nervous
about the <i>mehndi</i> tonight?

48:21.542 --> 48:23.750
Actually, just tell me
what that is.

48:23.750 --> 48:26.625
Well, in Pakistan,
we really like

48:26.625 --> 48:28.542
to draw out
the wedding celebrations.

48:28.542 --> 48:30.250
It's over three days.

48:31.125 --> 48:32.292
Uh...

48:32.292 --> 48:34.708
And first it's the <i>mehndi,</i>
which is tonight.

48:34.708 --> 48:36.250
And, uh...

48:36.250 --> 48:39.250
Kind of like a stag
and a hen rolled into one.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.333
Except your grandparents are
there, which is lovely.

48:41.333 --> 48:43.167
And the groom
isn't stripped naked

48:43.167 --> 48:44.833
and tied to a lamppost.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.000
And then the next day
is the <i>nikah,</i>

48:47.000 --> 48:48.667
that's the actual marriage.

48:49.250 --> 48:51.667
And the <i>shaadi.</i>
Then, er, <i>walima.</i>

48:52.375 --> 48:54.375
Where the main thing is
you have to look

48:54.375 --> 48:56.583
like you haven't enjoyed
your first night together.

48:58.792 --> 49:00.625
What if
you haven't enjoyed

49:00.625 --> 49:01.750
your first night together?

49:02.417 --> 49:04.167
- No comment?
- No comment.

49:04.792 --> 49:06.250
Can we go in?

49:07.417 --> 49:10.208
My mum would love this.
Can I film in here?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.333
Afghanistan.

49:19.958 --> 49:22.333
It's beautiful.
How much is it?

49:23.458 --> 49:24.917
15,000.

49:32.167 --> 49:33.625
Give him 10,000.

49:33.625 --> 49:35.000
Here.

49:35.417 --> 49:36.667
Thank you.

49:40.083 --> 49:41.417
Thanks, Kaz.

49:43.708 --> 49:44.875
You know

49:45.833 --> 49:46.792
all that stuff,

49:48.625 --> 49:50.208
passion, and...

49:50.458 --> 49:52.875
chemistry, whatever you want
to call it,

49:55.500 --> 49:57.333
it's not
the most important thing.

49:58.583 --> 50:00.333
Doesn't last, anyway.

50:16.750 --> 50:18.000
It's amazing.

50:20.125 --> 50:21.375
He thinks you're my wife.

50:23.833 --> 50:25.833
I'm saying
that you're just a friend.

50:25.833 --> 50:27.667
Just friends.

50:28.208 --> 50:30.083
I was your first kiss, too.

50:33.208 --> 50:34.625
In the treehouse.

50:40.292 --> 50:42.625
I just can't believe
you've forgotten.

50:48.958 --> 50:50.458
Kaz.

50:50.458 --> 50:51.833
Hmm?

50:53.375 --> 50:55.750
What was that row
with your mum about?

50:58.708 --> 50:59.708
It's...

51:01.292 --> 51:04.292
Just about Jamila
coming to the wedding.

51:04.583 --> 51:07.542
Why is what she did so bad?

51:07.542 --> 51:08.750
A Muslim woman isn't supposed

51:08.750 --> 51:10.875
to marry a non-Muslim guy.
It's <i>haram,</i> innit?

51:10.875 --> 51:12.375
- I know.
- She ran off with this guy,

51:12.375 --> 51:14.750
broke my grandfather's heart. Literally.

51:15.375 --> 51:17.167
He died a week later.

51:17.167 --> 51:19.208
You can't blame that on her.

51:19.500 --> 51:20.792
Then she didn't even come
to the funeral.

51:20.792 --> 51:21.917
Why not?

51:21.917 --> 51:23.625
She wanted him...

51:24.375 --> 51:26.708
David, to be welcome, too.

51:26.708 --> 51:28.042
Can I film you saying
this stuff?

51:28.042 --> 51:29.583
- No.
- Please, Kaz.

51:29.583 --> 51:31.083
I can't just show
what you want me to show.

51:31.083 --> 51:33.000
If it's not truthful,
it just won't have any value.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.292
Please.

51:34.917 --> 51:37.625
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- You know they've had a baby?

51:38.208 --> 51:41.625
My mum's first grandchild
who she's never even met.

51:41.625 --> 51:44.333
All this unhappiness.
All she did was fall in love.

51:44.333 --> 51:45.583
No, that's not
all she did, Zoe.

51:45.583 --> 51:47.167
She chose love over family.

51:47.167 --> 51:48.917
But isn't that the whole point
of marriage?

51:48.917 --> 51:50.125
There are some things

51:50.125 --> 51:51.333
I don't expect you
to understand.

51:51.333 --> 51:52.500
Can you explain to me

51:52.500 --> 51:54.000
how it's so different
even though we grew up

51:54.000 --> 51:55.042
on the same street?

51:55.042 --> 51:56.250
- How are we different?
- Yes.

51:56.250 --> 51:58.417
- Are you serious?
- Please.

51:59.083 --> 52:00.833
Okay.

52:02.042 --> 52:03.167
For a start, you don't
get asked every week

52:03.167 --> 52:04.250
where you're from originally,

52:04.250 --> 52:06.208
or how often you
go back to Pakistan.

52:06.208 --> 52:07.708
You're British,
I'm British born,

52:07.708 --> 52:09.958
which we all know is just code
for non-white.

52:09.958 --> 52:11.250
Brit-ish, you know.

52:13.333 --> 52:15.125
And you're not expected
to apologise profoundly

52:15.125 --> 52:16.417
on behalf of all brown people

52:16.417 --> 52:17.750
every time there's
a terror attack

52:17.750 --> 52:18.833
anywhere in the world.

52:21.167 --> 52:22.750
There was an entire continent

52:22.750 --> 52:25.458
between number 49 and 47, Zoe.

52:25.458 --> 52:28.042
Isn't that why
you're making the film?

52:35.792 --> 52:37.500
I have to pray. I'll be back.

54:06.375 --> 54:07.500
Thank you.

54:45.583 --> 54:46.583
Zoe.

54:47.292 --> 54:48.292
Zoe.

54:48.792 --> 54:50.458
You're in the bride's way.

55:13.833 --> 55:15.958
You look very beautiful.

55:17.792 --> 55:19.333
Thank you.

55:21.042 --> 55:22.042
Hi.

55:25.417 --> 55:26.708
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:26.708 --> 55:28.125
Why are all the women here

55:28.125 --> 55:29.625
dressed in easy access
garments?

55:29.625 --> 55:32.000
This is Pucci. Baby.

55:34.083 --> 55:37.833
And that's Mousey,
Toffee and Binky.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.625
Do they have
no shame?

55:41.250 --> 55:42.583
I want to go home.

55:42.583 --> 55:44.458
Nani Jan,
please don't leave.

55:44.458 --> 55:45.792
Not yet. It's...

55:45.792 --> 55:47.375
Let her leave.

55:47.375 --> 55:49.875
When dinosaurs leave,
at least we all can relax.

56:50.958 --> 56:52.625
Sorry about this.

56:54.375 --> 56:56.125
Not too much smiling.

57:00.458 --> 57:02.417
Now the party starts.

57:02.417 --> 57:03.792

57:26.917 --> 57:28.292
It's Coke masala.

57:28.292 --> 57:30.000
- Masala?
- It's really good.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.250
- It's so good.

57:32.250 --> 57:35.042
- Whisky.

Congratulations.

57:48.208 --> 57:49.875
Selfie, selfie.

57:53.958 --> 57:55.625
Have you seen Maymouna?

57:56.167 --> 57:58.500
- I think she was...
- There she is.

57:59.833 --> 58:01.958
And she's a blonde.

58:01.958 --> 58:03.833
Kaz! Come!

58:09.583 --> 58:11.083
Ooh!

58:11.083 --> 58:14.125
Kaz, you... You still haven't
met my friend.

58:14.667 --> 58:15.708
- Taqi.
- Ah.

58:15.708 --> 58:17.125
Lahore's hair king.

58:17.125 --> 58:18.583
Er, queen, darling.

58:18.583 --> 58:20.875
And don't the honeymoon
highlights look fabulous, huh?

58:20.875 --> 58:22.167
- Amazing.

58:22.167 --> 58:23.208
- Mmm-hmm.
- Nice to meet you.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.625
- Hi. How are you?
- High. How are you?

58:28.167 --> 58:30.417
He means,
"How high are you?"

58:31.958 --> 58:34.917
Sorry. This is my friend, Zoe.
We're friends from London.

58:34.917 --> 58:36.708
- Hi. You want a jay?
- Hey.

58:36.708 --> 58:38.583
Oh, no. No, thanks.

58:38.583 --> 58:39.917
Take one.

58:39.917 --> 58:43.542
Taqi brings all the treats
to the party. Always.

58:43.542 --> 58:45.167
Darling, I'm only
following the rules.

58:45.167 --> 58:46.250
The Quran says,

58:46.250 --> 58:47.458
if a man lies
with another man,

58:47.458 --> 58:49.500
- he should be stoned.

58:51.667 --> 58:53.458
Married tomorrow.

58:53.458 --> 58:55.917
- Sin tonight?
- I'm good, thank you.

58:55.917 --> 58:57.167
Oh, my God.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.500
I hope I'm not gonna be
calling you <i>chachoo.</i>

59:00.708 --> 59:03.292
- What's <i>"chachoo"?</i>
- It means "uncle".

59:03.292 --> 59:06.042
I thought
that you'd all be more...

59:06.042 --> 59:07.167
More modern,

59:07.167 --> 59:09.333
living in London and all,
you know.

59:09.333 --> 59:11.875
But I mean, hello?

59:14.250 --> 59:15.583
Oh...

59:15.583 --> 59:16.708
Finally.

59:18.708 --> 59:19.667
Hmm.

59:24.958 --> 59:27.667
- Let's... Let's dance.

59:27.667 --> 59:29.542
- You coming?
- Uh, not right now.

59:29.542 --> 59:31.583
- You guys go. Have fun.
- Aw...

59:33.375 --> 59:35.000
I think I'm gonna just...

59:35.625 --> 59:36.958
You want?

59:36.958 --> 59:38.833
No, I'm gonna go and follow...
Nice to meet you guys, though.

59:38.833 --> 59:40.083
Bye!

59:51.875 --> 59:53.250
Whoo!

59:57.625 --> 59:59.333
She likes a party.

1:00:05.250 --> 1:00:06.292
Yeah.

1:00:11.292 --> 1:00:14.208
Not exactly what my parents
had in mind.

1:00:22.667 --> 1:00:23.792
We should go.

1:00:39.208 --> 1:00:40.917
Are you okay?

1:00:40.917 --> 1:00:42.542
Just tired.

1:00:43.417 --> 1:00:45.167
You're sure it's okay to

1:00:45.625 --> 1:00:47.625
leave your own <i>mehndi?</i>

1:00:47.625 --> 1:00:49.875
No-one's gonna notice,
trust me.

1:00:51.292 --> 1:00:52.542
<i>Chachoo.</i>

1:00:57.042 --> 1:00:58.292
One second.

1:01:04.208 --> 1:01:07.250
Oh, wow.
I wanna show you something.

1:01:07.542 --> 1:01:09.625
- Come. Come.
- What?

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.708
Sufi music.

1:01:28.750 --> 1:01:31.333
No, Zoe. Just listen.
Just listen. He's...

1:01:31.792 --> 1:01:33.542
He's singing to God.

1:01:37.417 --> 1:01:39.000
Singing about a...

1:01:40.625 --> 1:01:42.208
dangerous love.

1:01:43.167 --> 1:01:44.500
Keeps him awake at night.

1:02:04.750 --> 1:02:06.167
You see?

1:02:06.750 --> 1:02:08.333
He's going mad.

1:02:12.958 --> 1:02:13.958
I told you, Zoe.

1:02:13.958 --> 1:02:15.958
Love is a dangerous
mental illness.

1:03:18.708 --> 1:03:20.958
What?

1:03:23.625 --> 1:03:25.292
I didn't forget it.

1:03:28.458 --> 1:03:30.167
The treehouse.

1:04:54.208 --> 1:04:55.500
If it wasn't for Islam,

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:57.167
there would have been
no Reformation.

1:04:57.167 --> 1:04:58.625
- No Renaissance.
- Hi.

1:04:58.625 --> 1:05:00.042
No toothbrushes.

1:05:00.042 --> 1:05:01.125
Hi.

1:05:02.417 --> 1:05:04.583
Hello, everyone.
That was a hoot, wasn't it?

1:05:04.583 --> 1:05:06.333
Have something to eat?
- I'm fine.

1:05:07.208 --> 1:05:08.333
Where did you all go?

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:10.792
I was perfecting my Hollywood,

1:05:10.792 --> 1:05:13.125
Dollywood, Bollywood,

1:05:13.125 --> 1:05:16.167
thingies, and I turned round,
you'd all disappeared.

1:05:16.167 --> 1:05:18.167
What else did Muslims invent?

1:05:18.167 --> 1:05:19.417
Algorithms.
- Bicycles.

1:05:19.417 --> 1:05:21.292
- Coffee. Algebra.
- Chickens?

1:05:21.292 --> 1:05:23.708
No, that's...
- Chicken korma?

1:05:24.667 --> 1:05:26.292
- The first flying machine.
- Yes.

1:05:26.292 --> 1:05:27.750
- Yes, well done.
- That's right!

1:05:29.500 --> 1:05:31.792
I could do
without algorithms myself.

1:05:32.125 --> 1:05:33.167
Thank God

1:05:33.167 --> 1:05:35.708
the bride didn't
join the dancing last night.

1:05:35.708 --> 1:05:37.958
Oh, well, no, you...

1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:41.375
No, she didn't.

1:05:42.375 --> 1:05:43.542
- You enjoyed yourself.
-  Hi.

1:05:43.542 --> 1:05:44.792
That's important.

1:05:44.792 --> 1:05:47.042
Um, do you think we can talk?

1:05:47.042 --> 1:05:50.208
5:00 p.m. sharp for the <i>nikah,</i>
everybody, okay?

1:05:50.208 --> 1:05:53.542
- I'm not sure...
- No, on camera, I mean.

1:06:02.042 --> 1:06:04.625
You're getting married
in a few hours.

1:06:05.375 --> 1:06:06.375
Yeah.

1:06:07.333 --> 1:06:08.458
How are you feeling?

1:06:08.458 --> 1:06:10.583
Feeling fine.

1:06:10.583 --> 1:06:13.208
No pre-wedding nerves, or...

1:06:13.208 --> 1:06:14.500
No.

1:06:20.500 --> 1:06:21.917
I'm all good.

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.500
You're still fully signed up
to this?

1:06:32.125 --> 1:06:33.125
Yes.

1:06:39.125 --> 1:06:41.167
And this is what you want?

1:06:42.583 --> 1:06:44.333
Yes, this is what I want.

1:06:56.417 --> 1:06:58.167
Is that it, or...

1:06:59.208 --> 1:07:00.792
Got everything you need?

1:07:01.792 --> 1:07:03.333
Kaz, this is mad.

1:07:04.375 --> 1:07:05.750
What's... What's mad?

1:07:06.458 --> 1:07:09.208
I just, um...

1:07:09.208 --> 1:07:11.792
I just... I feel
like everyone's pretending.

1:07:11.792 --> 1:07:13.500
- Who's pretending?
- Er...

1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:14.917
Everyone.

1:07:15.833 --> 1:07:19.042
I mean, just you're pretending
Jamila doesn't exist.

1:07:19.042 --> 1:07:21.708
Er, pretending Maymouna
doesn't dance.

1:07:21.708 --> 1:07:24.917
Pretending no one has sex!
Kaz, you're 32 years old!

1:07:24.917 --> 1:07:27.250
And your parents don't even
know you smoke.

1:07:27.250 --> 1:07:29.833
Oh, my God. I told you before.
That's about respect, Zoe.

1:07:29.833 --> 1:07:32.167
This is not a veil
on your sins.

1:07:32.167 --> 1:07:36.375
This is a bloody great burka
shrouding your whole identity.

1:07:38.417 --> 1:07:39.750
What do you want?

1:07:39.750 --> 1:07:42.417
I don't want you to marry
someone you don't love.

1:07:44.042 --> 1:07:45.792
Life's too short.

1:07:46.375 --> 1:07:48.667
And too long
to marry the wrong person.

1:07:49.375 --> 1:07:50.833
What do you want for you?

1:07:50.833 --> 1:07:52.125
Well, this isn't about me.

1:07:52.125 --> 1:07:53.792
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

1:07:53.792 --> 1:07:55.375
You keep questioning
my decisions.

1:07:55.375 --> 1:07:56.625
Maybe you should focus
on your own choices.

1:07:56.625 --> 1:07:57.958
What is that supposed to mean?

1:07:57.958 --> 1:07:59.250
Maybe the reason
you haven't got anyone

1:07:59.250 --> 1:08:01.167
to watch a TV series with

1:08:01.167 --> 1:08:02.250
is that you actively

1:08:02.250 --> 1:08:03.500
search out anyone
who is wrong.

1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:05.542
Oh, my God. This is bullshit.

1:08:05.542 --> 1:08:06.833
No, it's not bullshit.

1:08:06.833 --> 1:08:08.625
A man could be wearing
a literal red flag,

1:08:08.625 --> 1:08:10.833
and you'd think it was
a sexy colour on him.

1:08:11.083 --> 1:08:13.333
If the first person you date
is a dick, you're unlucky.

1:08:13.333 --> 1:08:16.082
If the next ten people
you date are dicks,

1:08:16.082 --> 1:08:17.167
then maybe you need

1:08:17.167 --> 1:08:18.667
to take a long look
at yourself in the mirror,

1:08:18.667 --> 1:08:20.332
and ask yourself why.

1:08:25.457 --> 1:08:26.750
Have you got any more

1:08:26.750 --> 1:08:29.292
profound psychological
insights?

1:08:29.292 --> 1:08:30.542
I have a question.

1:08:32.457 --> 1:08:34.792
Does it hurt less
when you aim low and miss?

1:08:41.542 --> 1:08:42.875
Huh.

1:09:09.917 --> 1:09:12.000
Be careful.

1:09:14.542 --> 1:09:15.707
I didn't see you,
Nani Jan.

1:09:15.707 --> 1:09:17.375
But you heard me.

1:09:20.957 --> 1:09:24.000
Don't break our hearts again.

1:09:48.167 --> 1:09:49.292
Agreed.

1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.250
All Pakistani brides
always cry

1:11:15.250 --> 1:11:16.875
as they leave their family.

1:11:16.875 --> 1:11:17.917
It's a tradition.

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:21.375
Isn't it gorgeous?

1:11:35.750 --> 1:11:37.833
<i>Can we have</i>
Beauty And The Beast?

1:11:37.833 --> 1:11:39.458
<i>Yes, please.</i>

1:11:39.458 --> 1:11:42.125
Yeah, of course you can.

1:11:42.125 --> 1:11:43.208
Come on, then.

1:11:43.208 --> 1:11:44.500
- Coming.

1:11:46.208 --> 1:11:48.750
<i>Beauty And The Beast.</i>

1:11:50.125 --> 1:11:52.250
<i>Well, Beast had his faults.</i>

1:11:52.917 --> 1:11:55.125
<i>But persistence pays off.</i>

1:11:55.125 --> 1:11:58.167
<i>He didn't actually lock Beauty
in his cellar.</i>

1:11:58.500 --> 1:11:59.958
<i>That's just
what a relationship</i>

1:11:59.958 --> 1:12:01.750
<i>felt like to Beauty.</i>

1:12:01.750 --> 1:12:02.958
<i>Over time,</i>

1:12:02.958 --> 1:12:05.375
<i>Beauty grew to enjoy
Beast's company.</i>

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.042
<i>You know,</i>

1:12:07.042 --> 1:12:08.750
<i>he was dependable
and available,</i>

1:12:09.167 --> 1:12:11.833
<i>and there's a lot to be said
for those qualities.</i>

1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:15.333
<i>Was the Beast
her dream hunk? No.</i>

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:18.333
<i>Did he sweep her
off her feet? No.</i>

1:12:18.333 --> 1:12:21.458
<i>Did he take her breath away?
Perhaps not.</i>

1:12:21.458 --> 1:12:22.833
<i>But Beauty had learnt</i>

1:12:22.833 --> 1:12:25.083
<i>that it's better
to simmer, then boil.</i>

1:12:25.083 --> 1:12:28.458
Do you not have to be a vegan
to do your job?

1:12:28.458 --> 1:12:29.792
To be a vet.

1:12:29.792 --> 1:12:30.958
No, actually, normally,

1:12:30.958 --> 1:12:32.083
I'm only allowed to eat

1:12:32.083 --> 1:12:33.458
the animals I put down.

1:12:33.458 --> 1:12:34.375
- I'm kidding.

1:12:34.375 --> 1:12:35.708
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

1:12:35.708 --> 1:12:36.917
I'm...

1:12:39.708 --> 1:12:42.125
That's so close
to the bone.

1:12:50.500 --> 1:12:52.625
Right,
does anyone want anymore?

1:12:52.625 --> 1:12:55.125
<i>What the Beast was, kids,</i>

1:12:55.125 --> 1:12:57.500
<i>was good enough.</i>

1:12:58.042 --> 1:12:59.875
And sometimes,

1:13:00.667 --> 1:13:04.167
good enough is good enough.

1:13:04.625 --> 1:13:07.542
And she was in love
with the Beast.

1:13:07.542 --> 1:13:10.042
She was in like with him.

1:13:10.042 --> 1:13:11.667
What do you mean, "in like"?

1:13:11.667 --> 1:13:14.667
In like with him,
which is way more important.

1:13:21.458 --> 1:13:22.958
- Zoe.
- Great crowd.

1:13:22.958 --> 1:13:24.250
Mmm.
Yeah.

1:13:24.250 --> 1:13:25.958
- Diverse.
Tick.

1:13:26.625 --> 1:13:28.833
- Ooh. Grey pound.
- Tick.

1:13:28.833 --> 1:13:30.333
This is my mum, actually.

1:13:30.333 --> 1:13:33.292
Mum, this is Olly and Sam
who commissioned the film.

1:13:33.292 --> 1:13:36.125
Oh, important.

1:13:36.125 --> 1:13:38.333
So nice to meet you.
Am I in it?

1:13:38.333 --> 1:13:39.583
Oh, you'll have
to wait and see.

1:13:39.583 --> 1:13:41.750
Yeah.

1:13:41.750 --> 1:13:42.958
Oh, that's James.

1:13:42.958 --> 1:13:44.458
This is Zoe's boyfriend. Saintly.

1:13:44.458 --> 1:13:45.875
And he's a top vet.

1:13:45.875 --> 1:13:46.958
Aren't you?

1:13:46.958 --> 1:13:48.042
Oh, well,
don't know about that.

1:13:48.042 --> 1:13:49.708
Britain's Top Vet?

1:13:49.708 --> 1:13:51.167
Here we go. Here they come.

1:13:51.167 --> 1:13:52.500
Leading vets compete

1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:53.625
in a range
of medical challenges.

1:13:53.625 --> 1:13:54.792
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- James, yes.

1:13:54.792 --> 1:13:56.833
- Okay, yeah.

1:13:57.833 --> 1:13:58.875
Hi.

1:13:59.583 --> 1:14:00.958
Hi.

1:14:01.667 --> 1:14:02.625
How are you?

1:14:04.667 --> 1:14:05.667
Good.

1:14:06.375 --> 1:14:08.250
How... How's married life?

1:14:08.250 --> 1:14:10.500
I'm getting settled. It's...

1:14:11.125 --> 1:14:12.167
Mmm-hmm.

1:14:13.375 --> 1:14:16.208
- I heard you met someone.
- Kind of. Um...

1:14:17.542 --> 1:14:20.958
My mum did.
I followed your example.

1:14:20.958 --> 1:14:22.625
- So, yeah. Not a dick.

1:14:23.958 --> 1:14:25.375
Result.

1:14:27.833 --> 1:14:28.958
Are you happy?

1:14:29.625 --> 1:14:30.625
Mmm-hmm.

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.208
And you?

1:14:33.208 --> 1:14:35.333
Yeah. I'm getting there.

1:14:36.917 --> 1:14:38.500
Good.

1:14:40.417 --> 1:14:42.292
- Hi.
- Hi, Maymouna.

1:14:42.292 --> 1:14:45.000
Hi. How are you doing?
How are you enjoying London?

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.708
London is good.

1:14:46.708 --> 1:14:48.708
She's missing home.

1:14:48.708 --> 1:14:51.625
- Which is only natural.
- Of course.

1:14:51.625 --> 1:14:53.333
But, hey, listen. Um...

1:14:53.792 --> 1:14:55.375
About the film.

1:14:55.625 --> 1:14:58.250
I just... I wanted to
warn you. It's a rough cut,

1:14:58.250 --> 1:14:59.750
so, it's just...
There's still...

1:14:59.750 --> 1:15:03.083
Okay, everyone.
We are ready to kick off.

1:15:03.083 --> 1:15:04.833
- So, Zoe, okay?

1:15:05.792 --> 1:15:07.667
Shall we?

1:15:07.667 --> 1:15:09.750
- Good luck.
- Yeah. Thanks. You, too.

1:15:17.458 --> 1:15:19.583
Hello.

1:15:19.583 --> 1:15:21.542
Hi, everyone. Um...

1:15:22.458 --> 1:15:25.583
Wow, thank you so much
for coming. Thank you.

1:15:25.583 --> 1:15:27.167
I just wanted
to say a few words

1:15:27.167 --> 1:15:28.833
about my own journey

1:15:28.833 --> 1:15:30.042
making this film.

1:15:30.667 --> 1:15:33.833
So, I used to think
that arranged marriages

1:15:33.833 --> 1:15:37.542
were this mad, out-dated idea.

1:15:38.208 --> 1:15:41.292
And, when my friend and
neighbour, Farooq, had one,

1:15:41.292 --> 1:15:43.333
I couldn't believe
he could ever be happy.

1:15:44.625 --> 1:15:47.750
But I was wrong.

1:15:47.750 --> 1:15:50.875
I was wrong.
Um, and now I wonder

1:15:50.875 --> 1:15:54.375
as someone with a slightly
chequered romantic history...

1:15:54.375 --> 1:15:55.917
- Oh, no heckling, please.

1:15:55.917 --> 1:15:57.042
Thanks, Mum.

1:15:57.042 --> 1:16:00.583
Now I wonder whether there
is something to be learned

1:16:00.583 --> 1:16:03.917
from a social system which
offers the opportunity to meet

1:16:03.917 --> 1:16:06.208
available, like-minded,

1:16:06.792 --> 1:16:09.625
non-commitment phobic men, um,

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.625
chosen by the person
who knows you best.

1:16:13.250 --> 1:16:15.167
Me. Like me.

1:16:16.250 --> 1:16:19.875
And also, you know,
maybe between the two extremes

1:16:19.875 --> 1:16:21.500
of no choice
in forced marriages,

1:16:21.500 --> 1:16:24.583
and just too much choice
on dating apps...

1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.125
I'm always on dating apps.

1:16:27.125 --> 1:16:28.333
You know,

1:16:28.333 --> 1:16:30.583
maybe somewhere between
passion and pragmatism,

1:16:30.958 --> 1:16:33.833
maybe there's a path
to happy ever after.

1:16:33.833 --> 1:16:34.958
<i>Inshallah, inshallah.</i>

1:16:34.958 --> 1:16:36.250
<i>Inshallah.</i>

1:16:36.250 --> 1:16:37.750
Um, okay,
I'm gonna stop waffling now.

1:16:37.750 --> 1:16:39.583
I'm talking way too much.

1:16:39.583 --> 1:16:42.333
But I do want to say
just the biggest thank you

1:16:42.333 --> 1:16:43.750
to Kaz and Maymouna.

1:16:43.750 --> 1:16:45.625
Thank you so, so much

1:16:45.625 --> 1:16:47.208
- for allowing me to film...

1:16:47.208 --> 1:16:50.208
...you walking into love.

1:17:09.542 --> 1:17:11.917
- Er, hi.
- Hi.

1:17:11.917 --> 1:17:14.708
- All right. Can I just take?
- Yeah, of course.

1:17:14.708 --> 1:17:15.833
Cheers.

1:17:24.625 --> 1:17:27.667
<i>Is it that different from
using filters on your Tinder?</i>

1:17:27.667 --> 1:17:29.167
<i>It's not really lying, is it?</i>

1:17:29.167 --> 1:17:30.208
<i>It's...</i>

1:17:30.667 --> 1:17:31.917
We're just told to put

1:17:31.917 --> 1:17:33.208
- a veil on our sins.
Ooh.

1:17:33.208 --> 1:17:36.458
<i>Nikah is a sacred
marriage contract.</i>

1:17:36.458 --> 1:17:38.083
According to Islam,

1:17:38.083 --> 1:17:40.708
bride and groom must both

1:17:40.708 --> 1:17:43.083
define their own terms
and conditions.

1:17:43.083 --> 1:17:47.708
<i>Power of divorce is available
to both partners equally.</i>

1:17:47.708 --> 1:17:50.583
Mahr <i>is a token commitment</i>

1:17:50.583 --> 1:17:52.333
<i>of the husband's
responsibility.</i>

1:17:56.250 --> 1:17:57.292
Hi.

1:17:57.292 --> 1:17:59.125
Oh, hi.

1:18:01.875 --> 1:18:04.000
- How's it going down?
- Yeah, good.

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.958
I don't dare go back in.

1:18:06.958 --> 1:18:08.042
- What?
- Huh?

1:18:08.042 --> 1:18:09.542
You're super talented.

1:18:09.542 --> 1:18:10.625
Oh.

1:18:12.792 --> 1:18:13.833
Ugh!

1:18:13.833 --> 1:18:15.250
- Zoe.
- Mmm?

1:18:16.250 --> 1:18:17.708
Can we talk?

1:18:21.042 --> 1:18:23.750
Nothing good's ever come
after those three words, but...

1:18:23.750 --> 1:18:24.792
Look...

1:18:26.333 --> 1:18:27.250
You're the dream.

1:18:27.875 --> 1:18:29.500
If I ever thought I'd end up
with someone like you,

1:18:29.500 --> 1:18:31.375
I never would have
been a tortured teenager.

1:18:31.375 --> 1:18:32.417
Ooh.

1:18:33.958 --> 1:18:36.750
You're either proposing to me
or breaking up with me.

1:18:36.750 --> 1:18:38.167
I can't figure out which.

1:18:44.542 --> 1:18:46.250
Oh, shit.

1:18:49.208 --> 1:18:50.667
I just don't want...

1:18:55.042 --> 1:18:57.125
I just can't be your plan B.

1:19:00.458 --> 1:19:01.958
- I want more than that.
- Don't...

1:19:01.958 --> 1:19:04.250
What are you doing?
This is fine.

1:19:04.250 --> 1:19:05.625
All right? This is going fine.

1:19:05.625 --> 1:19:08.875
Yeah, but I don't want fine.

1:19:08.875 --> 1:19:10.000
Why?

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.125
Everyone likes fine!

1:19:12.125 --> 1:19:14.750
Zoe, you don't
want fine either.

1:19:22.333 --> 1:19:24.625
How do you know what I want?

1:19:37.250 --> 1:19:40.500
- What am I gonna tell my mum?
- Oh, um...

1:19:41.583 --> 1:19:44.583
Tell her
that I will probably end up

1:19:44.583 --> 1:19:46.750
being your sensible
second husband.

1:19:51.875 --> 1:19:53.875
Well, I mean, either that
or I'll marry the dog.

1:20:09.625 --> 1:20:11.375
<i>It was devastating.</i>

1:20:13.542 --> 1:20:15.500
I think the worst moment
for me was

1:20:15.500 --> 1:20:18.042
when we had
our beautiful little girl,

1:20:19.125 --> 1:20:23.042
and I realised that she would
never know her grandparents.

1:20:23.708 --> 1:20:26.542
<i>I had such a special
relationship with mine.</i>

1:20:27.750 --> 1:20:30.125
<i>But I always knew that</i>

1:20:30.125 --> 1:20:33.167
<i>that would be the price
we'd pay to be together.</i>

1:20:33.917 --> 1:20:37.708
I, um... I did read the Quran
before we got married

1:20:37.708 --> 1:20:40.083
just to try and understand it
a bit.

1:20:40.917 --> 1:20:42.750
It says, "A husband and wife

1:20:42.750 --> 1:20:45.125
"should be like garments
to each other.

1:20:45.125 --> 1:20:47.417
"To protect and keep
each other warm".

1:20:48.083 --> 1:20:50.083
We used that
in our wedding vows.

1:20:51.083 --> 1:20:53.083
<i>Do you have any regrets?</i>

1:20:53.458 --> 1:20:56.792
I regret that I caused
my family so much pain.

1:20:57.625 --> 1:21:00.292
Especially my <i>nani jan,</i>
my grandmother.

1:21:02.042 --> 1:21:04.458
<i>I can never forget her face
when I left.</i>

1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:08.667
<i>But, I...</i>

1:21:08.667 --> 1:21:10.500
I don't believe that

1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:13.208
we choose who we fall
in love with. It's...

1:21:13.208 --> 1:21:16.792
It's too overwhelming
to be in our control.

1:21:18.292 --> 1:21:21.875
<i>But even if it had been
a choice and not my kismet,</i>

1:21:22.500 --> 1:21:24.375
<i>I'd still have chosen him.</i>

1:21:36.583 --> 1:21:38.000
Hey.

1:21:38.750 --> 1:21:40.667
What were you thinking, Zoe?

1:21:41.167 --> 1:21:42.500
I trusted you.

1:21:43.167 --> 1:21:45.083
I was just doing my job.

1:21:45.083 --> 1:21:46.667
Your job isn't
to humiliate my family

1:21:46.667 --> 1:21:48.625
by broadcasting our issues
to the world.

1:21:48.625 --> 1:21:51.292
I had to include Jamila.
Come on.

1:21:51.292 --> 1:21:53.792
Please, why is that
so humiliating?

1:21:57.333 --> 1:21:59.167
Number 47...

1:21:59.167 --> 1:22:00.875
number 49.

1:22:00.875 --> 1:22:02.667
Different continents.

1:22:09.542 --> 1:22:11.333
It was beautiful.

1:22:11.333 --> 1:22:13.292
- Maymouna.

1:22:16.042 --> 1:22:17.333
Thank you.

1:22:45.875 --> 1:22:47.458
Zoe, that was a bit cruel.

1:22:47.458 --> 1:22:49.083
You could have told me
that outfit made me look

1:22:49.083 --> 1:22:50.375
like a pile of dirty washing.

1:22:50.375 --> 1:22:53.542
- Oh! Mum, not now!
- Where's... Where's James?

1:22:53.542 --> 1:22:56.042
He just dumped me. So...

1:22:56.042 --> 1:22:59.042
Oh, Zoe,
what have you done now?

1:22:59.042 --> 1:23:02.375
Oh, no! I thought
he was finally the solution.

1:23:02.375 --> 1:23:04.875
Oh! You sound like Hitler!

1:23:05.750 --> 1:23:06.750
Zoe...

1:23:07.042 --> 1:23:10.250
Come on, he's the best one
you've ever picked.

1:23:10.250 --> 1:23:12.292
I didn't pick him. You did.

1:23:21.125 --> 1:23:23.417
I'm worried
you're gonna end up alone.

1:23:25.292 --> 1:23:28.000
You're alone. You seem fine.

1:23:29.833 --> 1:23:31.958
- That's different...
- Am I

1:23:31.958 --> 1:23:34.375
just half a person
when I'm not with a man?

1:23:34.375 --> 1:23:35.667
Is that what you think?

1:23:35.667 --> 1:23:37.667
Am I just not enough for you
as I am?

1:23:39.208 --> 1:23:42.625
Oh, darling, that's not fair.
That's not fair!

1:23:42.625 --> 1:23:44.042
- I can't do this.
- I didn't...

1:23:46.625 --> 1:23:47.583
Zoe.

1:24:38.958 --> 1:24:40.958
Do you need to get that?

1:25:12.958 --> 1:25:14.292
Why didn't you tell me?

1:25:33.042 --> 1:25:34.667
So, what do we do now?

1:25:37.458 --> 1:25:38.542
Pretend.

1:25:39.708 --> 1:25:41.292
Like everyone else.

1:25:50.458 --> 1:25:51.542
"Pretend".

1:26:05.375 --> 1:26:06.958
<i>Sleeping Beauty</i>

1:26:08.292 --> 1:26:09.792
<i>tried to</i>

1:26:10.667 --> 1:26:13.042
<i>fake it to make it.</i>

1:26:25.708 --> 1:26:27.542
<i>She was just sad.</i>

1:26:29.750 --> 1:26:32.083
<i>And so she went to sleep</i>

1:26:33.708 --> 1:26:36.042
<i>for 100 years.</i>

1:26:41.125 --> 1:26:43.292
<i>Snow White was also sad.</i>

1:26:44.583 --> 1:26:47.292
<i>She ate a poisoned apple
on purpose</i>

1:26:48.958 --> 1:26:50.833
<i>because she was depressed.</i>

1:26:52.167 --> 1:26:53.917
<i>Which literally means</i>

1:26:55.750 --> 1:26:57.417
<i>"deep rest".</i>

1:26:59.583 --> 1:27:00.583
<i>And...</i>

1:27:01.458 --> 1:27:04.125
No-one lived
happily ever after

1:27:07.125 --> 1:27:09.333
because that never happens
in real life.

1:27:11.125 --> 1:27:13.792
<i>- Only in fairy tales.</i>

1:27:20.167 --> 1:27:21.250
So, yeah,

1:27:21.250 --> 1:27:22.250
if we look
at the section here...

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.500
What are you doing here?
All good?

1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:37.750
I keep calling and calling,
you never answer my phone.

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:42.208
All okay?

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.083
Yeah, everything's okay.

1:27:50.708 --> 1:27:52.625
How's Maymouna? And...

1:27:54.167 --> 1:27:56.083
How are you both getting on?

1:27:56.625 --> 1:27:57.792
It's all fine.

1:28:05.125 --> 1:28:07.125
<i>Beta,</i> it takes time to adjust.

1:28:09.042 --> 1:28:11.542
It wasn't easy for me either
at the start.

1:28:12.667 --> 1:28:15.542
Your father and I hardly spoke
for the first month,

1:28:15.542 --> 1:28:16.625
and now look at us.

1:28:18.667 --> 1:28:22.208
Sorry, <i>ammi,</i> I'm...
So much to do. I'm busy today.

1:28:28.125 --> 1:28:29.125
Okay.

1:28:30.208 --> 1:28:32.375
So I'll see you both
for <i>Eid</i> tomorrow.

1:28:32.833 --> 1:28:33.792
If it's confirmed.

1:28:34.750 --> 1:28:36.208
I'll call you later, huh?

1:28:39.875 --> 1:28:41.458
You know, <i>beta,</i>

1:28:41.458 --> 1:28:43.333
why the Prophet said,

1:28:43.333 --> 1:28:46.083
"Paradise lies
at the mother's feet"?

1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.833
Because there is no love

1:28:50.833 --> 1:28:53.083
greater than a mother's love
for her child.

1:28:57.250 --> 1:28:59.417
That's why our prayers
are double.

1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:04.083
You know what I pray for
every night?

1:29:06.458 --> 1:29:08.458
I pray for your happiness.

1:29:09.542 --> 1:29:11.833
And the happiness
of all my children.

1:29:14.750 --> 1:29:16.583
That's all that matters.

1:29:25.708 --> 1:29:27.958
You know, I just wanna be
a good son, <i>ammi.</i>

1:29:28.833 --> 1:29:30.500
That's it.

1:29:51.875 --> 1:29:54.292
<i>For your messages, press two.</i>

1:29:54.292 --> 1:29:57.375
<i>Received, 3:34 p.m.</i>

1:29:57.375 --> 1:29:59.708
<i>Hi, Zoe.
Olly and Sam here</i>

1:29:59.708 --> 1:30:01.167
<i>from Big Bull Productions.</i>

1:30:01.167 --> 1:30:02.417
<i>Look, we loved the doc,</i>

1:30:02.417 --> 1:30:04.625
<i>but we've got a problem, okay?
White lens.</i>

1:30:04.625 --> 1:30:06.375
<i>Yeah,
diverse subject, great.</i>

1:30:06.375 --> 1:30:08.542
<i>White director,
it's not so great.</i>

1:30:08.542 --> 1:30:10.417
<i>Yeah, so, we're gonna
have to hit pause</i>

1:30:10.417 --> 1:30:11.917
<i>- on the project, okay?</i>

1:30:11.917 --> 1:30:13.083
<i>We're really sorry, obviously.</i>

1:30:13.083 --> 1:30:14.167
<i>Really sorry.</i>
<i>Obviously.</i>

1:30:14.167 --> 1:30:15.667
<i>And give us a call
if you want a chat.</i>

1:30:15.667 --> 1:30:16.958
Oh, shit.
<i>- Okay. Bye.</i>

1:30:16.958 --> 1:30:19.375
<i>Press two to repeat.</i>

1:30:21.875 --> 1:30:23.375
You shouldn't
leave your knickers

1:30:23.375 --> 1:30:26.208
just lying about on display.

1:30:26.750 --> 1:30:28.625
I don't understand.

1:30:28.625 --> 1:30:31.417
- Why are you all dressed up?
- It's <i>Eid.</i>

1:30:31.417 --> 1:30:32.917
I'm going to the Khans.

1:30:34.167 --> 1:30:35.625
That's good.

1:30:36.708 --> 1:30:38.208
Do you want to come?

1:30:38.917 --> 1:30:39.875
No, thank you.

1:30:42.250 --> 1:30:44.042
I'm the last person

1:30:44.042 --> 1:30:45.333
that they wanna see.

1:30:45.792 --> 1:30:46.958
Anyway, I'm packing.

1:30:48.292 --> 1:30:50.583
- Where are you going?
-  Turkey.

1:30:50.583 --> 1:30:51.708
For a break.

1:30:51.708 --> 1:30:54.833
Since everyone hated my film.

1:30:59.500 --> 1:31:02.000
- I must just say...

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.542
I do admire your independence.

1:31:08.917 --> 1:31:10.500
And I...

1:31:11.083 --> 1:31:12.292
You're wrong.

1:31:14.583 --> 1:31:17.750
I don't value you less
when you're not with a man.

1:31:19.417 --> 1:31:23.083
And I'm very, very proud
of everything you've achieved.

1:31:25.917 --> 1:31:27.167
But...

1:31:27.167 --> 1:31:29.792
But, nothing counts
before the "but".

1:31:31.500 --> 1:31:33.417
Well, but...

1:31:35.125 --> 1:31:38.292
There's a difference
between independence

1:31:39.042 --> 1:31:40.458
and being so cut off

1:31:40.458 --> 1:31:42.250
that no-one
can get close to you.

1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:46.833
We all need other people.
Even you.

1:31:47.500 --> 1:31:50.042
There's no weakness
in that, Zoe.

1:31:51.500 --> 1:31:52.583
Zahid's right.

1:31:52.583 --> 1:31:54.917
Loneliness is
a Western disease

1:31:54.917 --> 1:31:56.917
and it's far more deadly
than cancer.

1:31:56.917 --> 1:31:58.417
The only cure is to allow

1:31:58.417 --> 1:32:01.667
other people to care
about you, and not...

1:32:01.667 --> 1:32:04.625
Not to always
push them away.

1:32:10.792 --> 1:32:13.167
They say it takes a village
to raise a child.

1:32:13.167 --> 1:32:14.500
But what about the adults?

1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:18.750
I'd say it takes a village
to sustain an adult.

1:32:18.750 --> 1:32:21.167
And I'm so lucky

1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:24.500
to have found my village

1:32:24.500 --> 1:32:26.125
next door and...

1:32:27.625 --> 1:32:29.542
All I want

1:32:29.542 --> 1:32:31.875
is for you to find yours,
that's all.

1:32:43.667 --> 1:32:44.833
Come here.

1:32:53.125 --> 1:32:55.458
- That was you then.
- That was my phone.

1:32:56.333 --> 1:32:58.583
Saved by the bell.

1:32:58.583 --> 1:33:00.792
- Oh, it's from Kaz.
- That's nice.

1:33:04.708 --> 1:33:06.083
Can I have a biscuit?
- Yeah.

1:33:09.708 --> 1:33:11.875
<i>- Do I look nice?
- Yeah, you look great.</i>

1:33:13.333 --> 1:33:14.958
<i>Do you wanna...
Do you wanna...</i>

1:33:14.958 --> 1:33:17.125
<i>Okay, okay. Um...</i>

1:33:17.125 --> 1:33:18.417
<i>Hi.</i>

1:33:18.417 --> 1:33:19.500
<i>Uh...</i>

1:33:19.500 --> 1:33:22.208
<i>I loved your film, Zoe. And...</i>

1:33:22.208 --> 1:33:24.167
<i>I'm sorry if this kind of
ruins your ending,</i>

1:33:24.167 --> 1:33:25.250
<i>but...</i>

1:33:26.042 --> 1:33:28.292
<i>I think it's gonna
make it more truthful.</i>

1:33:32.667 --> 1:33:33.833
<i>Eid Mubarak.</i>

1:33:33.833 --> 1:33:34.625
<i>Eid Mubarak.</i>

1:33:43.125 --> 1:33:44.208
Just get the spoon. Uh...

1:33:44.208 --> 1:33:46.042
No, no, wait, I'll get that...

1:33:46.042 --> 1:33:48.000
- Help me cut.
- What do you want me to do?

1:33:49.125 --> 1:33:50.875
No, no, not like that!

1:33:53.375 --> 1:33:55.000
So festive, as ever!

1:33:56.542 --> 1:33:57.667
<i>Eid Mubarak.</i>

1:33:57.667 --> 1:34:00.000
Don't you look
gorgeous as always.

1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:01.542
I've brought you something
very, very boring.

1:34:01.542 --> 1:34:04.250
- Oh, you needn't have.
- And, erm, Zoe's here.

1:34:04.250 --> 1:34:05.792
Zoe.

1:34:05.792 --> 1:34:07.000
I'm sorry to gatecrash,

1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.917
but I really need
to talk to Kaz, please.

1:34:10.542 --> 1:34:11.833
You've been talking
quite a lot

1:34:11.833 --> 1:34:14.250
to all my children lately.

1:34:14.250 --> 1:34:15.375
Jalebis.

1:34:15.375 --> 1:34:16.958
I made them
especially for you.

1:34:16.958 --> 1:34:18.292
Well, thank you.
It's just you're trying

1:34:18.292 --> 1:34:19.375
- to give me diabetes.

1:34:19.375 --> 1:34:21.000
I know you are.

1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:22.083
- I'll eat it later.

1:34:22.083 --> 1:34:23.583
Can you just get the...

1:34:23.583 --> 1:34:24.625
Mmm.

1:34:30.792 --> 1:34:33.667
How is everything?
Everyone all right?

1:34:33.667 --> 1:34:35.875
Yeah, it's tense.
That's quite a thing.

1:34:35.875 --> 1:34:38.292
I mean, I can't...

1:34:38.292 --> 1:34:40.417
- Where's Maymouna?
- She's not coming.

1:34:40.417 --> 1:34:41.708
What do you mean
she's not coming?

1:34:46.958 --> 1:34:50.000
- Hello, darling. <i>Eid Mubarak.</i>
- Happy <i>Eid.</i>

1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:51.958
You smell lovely.

1:34:55.708 --> 1:34:57.917
Are you okay?
I just saw your email.

1:34:59.333 --> 1:35:01.667
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

1:35:02.250 --> 1:35:04.000
I'm glad you're here.

1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.792
Kazim.
Why isn't Maymouna here?

1:35:06.792 --> 1:35:07.958
Is she sick?

1:35:13.333 --> 1:35:15.500
<i>Ammi,</i> Maymouna's not sick.

1:35:22.542 --> 1:35:24.750
Unless you call heartbreak
a sickness.

1:35:24.750 --> 1:35:27.458
What do you mean?

1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:33.750
Turns out our marriage
was more

1:35:34.292 --> 1:35:36.875
"insisted" than "assisted".

1:35:36.875 --> 1:35:39.042
That's not possible.

1:35:39.042 --> 1:35:40.208
They're a modern family.

1:35:40.208 --> 1:35:41.833
Everybody was so happy
at the wedding.

1:35:41.833 --> 1:35:43.667
Where is she now?

1:35:44.708 --> 1:35:47.208
She is working up
the courage to

1:35:48.292 --> 1:35:50.958
tell her parents
we're divorced.

1:35:53.833 --> 1:35:54.875
Divorced?

1:35:55.958 --> 1:35:57.208
What do you mean?
Just like...

1:35:57.208 --> 1:35:59.917
All you have to say is,
"I divorce you,

1:35:59.917 --> 1:36:02.125
"I divorce you,
I divorce you".

1:36:02.625 --> 1:36:05.833
Oh, really?
I wish we had that here.

1:36:05.833 --> 1:36:09.667
<i>Beta,</i> triple <i>talaq</i>
is banned in Pakistan

1:36:09.667 --> 1:36:11.333
to stop people
from making rash decisions.

1:36:11.333 --> 1:36:12.917
<i>Ammi,</i> this isn't rash.

1:36:12.917 --> 1:36:15.375
It's... Maymouna was... is...

1:36:15.917 --> 1:36:17.958
in love with someone else.

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.917
Neither of us wants
to pretend any more.

1:36:25.417 --> 1:36:28.125
Okay,
since it's a day for

1:36:28.125 --> 1:36:29.208
bombshell disclosures.

1:36:29.208 --> 1:36:30.042
Um, I think we all need

1:36:30.042 --> 1:36:32.167
to try and just be
a bit more honest.

1:36:34.417 --> 1:36:36.542
You may as well all know
that I smoke.

1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:39.083
That's very bad for you.

1:36:39.083 --> 1:36:41.125
And I have done
since I was 15.

1:36:41.125 --> 1:36:44.500
But you're a doctor now,
so, not in public.

1:36:45.125 --> 1:36:47.375
I kept asking myself,

1:36:47.375 --> 1:36:48.542
"Why is this grown man

1:36:48.542 --> 1:36:50.083
"always up there
in that treehouse?

1:36:51.042 --> 1:36:52.292
"Does he think he is Tarzan?"

1:36:54.625 --> 1:36:56.208
And I drink sometimes.

1:36:56.208 --> 1:36:59.708
Just some red wine
for your cholesterol.

1:37:00.417 --> 1:37:02.667
Alcohol has some
medicinal value.

1:37:02.667 --> 1:37:03.958
That's a relief.

1:37:03.958 --> 1:37:06.125
Obviously,
I never ever touch pork.

1:37:06.125 --> 1:37:07.708
Of course not.

1:37:07.708 --> 1:37:09.375
You are Muslim, mmm?

1:37:10.833 --> 1:37:14.000
Okay. But there's something
way more important. Um...

1:37:15.333 --> 1:37:16.292
<i>Ammi...</i>

1:37:18.333 --> 1:37:21.083
You always say that <i>Eid</i> is
about family coming together.

1:37:21.083 --> 1:37:22.083
Yes.

1:37:25.167 --> 1:37:27.625
And if Zoe's film
has shown us one thing,

1:37:27.625 --> 1:37:28.958
it's that...

1:37:29.250 --> 1:37:30.500
it's that there's been
an important member

1:37:30.500 --> 1:37:32.750
of our family missing
for too long.

1:37:34.625 --> 1:37:36.292
Too long, <i>ammi jan.</i>

1:37:39.667 --> 1:37:41.917
Just give me one second.

1:37:42.833 --> 1:37:43.833
Sorry.

1:38:49.625 --> 1:38:50.625
<i>Inshallah.</i>

1:38:58.667 --> 1:39:00.250

1:39:00.250 --> 1:39:01.458
Beautiful.

1:39:02.750 --> 1:39:03.958
Sweetheart.

1:39:05.167 --> 1:39:07.667
<i>Eid Mubarak,</i> David,
<i>Eid Mubarak.</i>

1:39:15.750 --> 1:39:17.583
And I need my <i>nani jan.</i>

1:39:42.708 --> 1:39:43.708
Nani Jan.

1:39:47.583 --> 1:39:48.583
Nani Jan.

1:39:51.333 --> 1:39:52.542
Please.

1:40:52.208 --> 1:40:53.333
Oh.

1:40:53.333 --> 1:40:54.667
Where's Zoe gone?

1:40:54.667 --> 1:40:57.208
Is she gone already
without saying goodbye?

1:40:57.208 --> 1:40:58.583
I've spoken to her about that.

1:40:58.583 --> 1:41:00.000
She's halfway
to Constantinople by now,

1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.458
- I shouldn't wonder.
- Wait, what?

1:41:04.875 --> 1:41:06.583
- Kazim?

1:41:17.833 --> 1:41:19.375
- Where have you gone?

1:41:53.917 --> 1:41:55.167
Oi, Rapunzel.

1:41:57.708 --> 1:41:59.375
Let down your hair.

1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:03.208
I'm pretty sure I'm the witch
in this fairy tale.

1:42:32.042 --> 1:42:33.042
Hi.

1:42:34.792 --> 1:42:35.792
Hi.

1:42:39.833 --> 1:42:41.375
It's your turn.

1:42:41.375 --> 1:42:42.750
Yeah. Um...

1:42:45.542 --> 1:42:47.250
I can't speak.

1:42:47.250 --> 1:42:49.917
Okay. Sorry. Um...

1:42:51.208 --> 1:42:54.125
Okay. I'm gonna put myself
on the line here.

1:42:55.125 --> 1:42:56.250
Go on.

1:42:56.250 --> 1:42:59.208
-  This isn't easy.
- I know. I know.

1:42:59.208 --> 1:43:00.292
I'm really high up

1:43:00.292 --> 1:43:01.667
- and there's no safety...
- Zoe.

1:43:08.167 --> 1:43:11.000
Would you like to watch
a whole TV series with me?

1:43:16.708 --> 1:43:18.208
Are you sure?

1:43:18.875 --> 1:43:20.625
- Mmm...
- Because we...

1:43:21.583 --> 1:43:23.417
We should take it very...

1:43:24.125 --> 1:43:26.042
- You know, take it slowly.
- Yeah.

1:43:26.458 --> 1:43:28.250
Yeah, like an episode
at a time.

1:43:28.250 --> 1:43:30.542
- No bingeing.
- No bingeing.

1:43:33.375 --> 1:43:34.833
Just please don't
forget it this time.

1:43:34.833 --> 1:43:36.708
I never forgot. Never.

1:43:39.958 --> 1:43:41.292
And maybe we could just...

1:43:41.292 --> 1:43:44.125
Like, we could have a break
clause halfway through.

1:43:44.125 --> 1:43:46.167
Always a break clause. Always.

1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:51.875
- I... Just...
- Hmm.

1:44:43.708 --> 1:44:46.208
We couldn't have
arranged it better ourselves.

1:44:46.208 --> 1:44:47.250
<i>Mashallah!</i>

1:44:48.083 --> 1:44:49.833
That means, "Thank God".

1:44:53.125 --> 1:44:54.417
<i>Ammi jan</i> always said

1:44:54.417 --> 1:44:56.083
this would happen
if we came here,

1:44:56.083 --> 1:44:58.042
and he went
to a mixed university.

1:44:58.667 --> 1:45:00.833
Can't be expected to bowl
a googly every time.

1:45:01.875 --> 1:45:03.583
So, we moved out.

1:45:03.583 --> 1:45:05.125
Only down the road
to number nine.

1:45:05.125 --> 1:45:08.000
Except, er, we call it nine
and three quarters.

1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:09.542
Harry Potter!

1:45:10.583 --> 1:45:12.542
David's getting
to know the family.

1:45:12.542 --> 1:45:15.583
He's even learning Urdu
so he can understand Nani Jan.

1:45:16.250 --> 1:45:18.583
Poor little zebra,

1:45:18.583 --> 1:45:20.667
never knowing
what colour she is.

1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.250
It's called
mixed heritage, Nani Jan.

1:45:23.250 --> 1:45:24.792
Mixed heritage?

1:45:25.833 --> 1:45:28.333
I don't know
what you were expecting.

1:45:28.708 --> 1:45:30.542
My head on a stick?

1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.417
I'm fine.

1:45:33.417 --> 1:45:35.167
I am graduated.

1:45:35.167 --> 1:45:37.167
I'm a human rights lawyer.

1:45:37.167 --> 1:45:39.292
And my parents
are super proud.
