WEBVTT

00:02.194 --> 00:05.652
Captain's Log, Stardate 44429.6.

00:05.697 --> 00:08.894
We are on a mapping survey
near the Cardassian sector.

00:08.934 --> 00:12.062
It has been nearly a year
since a peace treaty ended

00:12.104 --> 00:15.403
the long conflict between
the Federation and Cardassia.

00:15.440 --> 00:20.377
Captain, we are nearing
the periphery of Sector 21503.

00:20.412 --> 00:21.572
Be on the lookout

00:21.613 --> 00:23.672
for a Cardassian patrol ship,
Mr. Worf.

00:23.715 --> 00:25.649
They should be hailing us soon.

00:25.684 --> 00:28.175
Even with the treaty,
they're still skittish

00:28.220 --> 00:29.847
about protecting their border.

00:29.888 --> 00:32.186
Last time I was in this sector

00:32.256 --> 00:34.191
I was on the <i>Stargazer</i>

00:34.226 --> 00:36.854
running at warp speed
ahead of a Cardassian warship.

00:36.895 --> 00:38.385
Running, Captain?

00:38.430 --> 00:40.364
You? That's hard to believe.

00:40.399 --> 00:41.798
Believe it.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.393
I'd been sent to make
preliminary overtures

00:44.436 --> 00:46.927
to a truce,
and I'd lowered my shields

00:46.972 --> 00:49.304
as a gesture of goodwill.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.070
The Cardassians
were not impressed.

00:51.109 --> 00:52.974
They had taken out
most of my weapons

00:53.011 --> 00:57.072
and damaged the impulse engines
before I could regroup and run.

00:57.115 --> 00:59.640
The Cardassians have no honor.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.915
I do not trust them.

01:01.953 --> 01:03.921
They're our allies now,
Mr. Worf.

01:03.955 --> 01:05.422
We have to trust them.

01:05.456 --> 01:08.949
Trust is earned, not given away.

01:12.264 --> 01:14.494
I hope their scout ship
makes contact soon.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.730
It's not a good idea to stay
too long on a Cardassian border

01:17.769 --> 01:19.828
without making
your intentions known.

01:26.745 --> 01:29.179
What... what is it?

01:29.247 --> 01:33.445
Kelp buds, plankton loaf
and sea berries.

01:33.485 --> 01:35.350
Oh.

01:38.657 --> 01:42.855
Sweetheart, I'm not a fish.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.191
It's very healthy.

01:44.262 --> 01:46.560
I had this every morning
when I was growing up.

01:46.598 --> 01:49.931
What? No muffins or oatmeal

01:49.968 --> 01:51.629
or corned beef and eggs?

01:51.670 --> 01:52.694
For breakfast?

01:52.738 --> 01:56.765
Keiko, I've been thinking.

01:56.808 --> 01:59.834
You've been introducing me
to all this wonderful food

01:59.878 --> 02:01.470
that you're accustomed to.

02:01.513 --> 02:03.071
I'd like to do the same.

02:03.115 --> 02:05.015
Isn't that
what marriage is about?

02:05.050 --> 02:06.347
Sharing?

02:06.385 --> 02:08.250
What kind of foods?

02:08.286 --> 02:11.778
Scalloped potatoes,
mutton shanks

02:11.823 --> 02:13.256
oxtails and cabbage.

02:13.291 --> 02:14.553
Kind of heavy.

02:14.593 --> 02:17.391
Oh, you'll love it.
I promise.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.556
Oh, I can still remember
the aromas

02:19.598 --> 02:21.293
when my mother was cooking.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.267
She cooked?

02:23.301 --> 02:25.269
Oh, she didn't believe
in a replicator.

02:25.303 --> 02:28.170
She thought real food
was more nutritious.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.003
She handled real meat?

02:30.041 --> 02:32.168
She touched it and cut it?

02:32.210 --> 02:34.269
Yeah, like a master chef.

02:34.312 --> 02:36.303
She was fantastic.

02:36.348 --> 02:38.942
Of course, I'll have to use
the replicator.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.612
I'll make something special
for you tonight.

02:41.653 --> 02:43.348
You'll love it.
I promise.

02:43.388 --> 02:44.946
Okay.

02:44.990 --> 02:48.187
Maybe I'll have something
special for you tonight too.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.057
Mmm...

02:52.197 --> 02:54.131
Something's wrong.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.599
Red Alert.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.761
Take emergency stations.

02:59.204 --> 03:01.729
Cardassian ship
preparing to fire again, sir.

03:01.773 --> 03:04.503
Increase power
to the forward shields.

03:06.511 --> 03:08.240
Hail them again, Mr. Worf.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.145
What the hell is he doing?
Damage report.

03:10.248 --> 03:11.772
Minor damage to secondary hull

03:11.817 --> 03:13.580
before we put up our shields,
sir.

03:13.618 --> 03:15.916
No casualties.
Structural integrity intact.

03:15.954 --> 03:17.922
Engineering to Bridge.

03:17.956 --> 03:19.924
Starboard power coupling
is down.

03:25.764 --> 03:27.561
Evasive action... Delta sequence.

03:27.599 --> 03:28.759
Ready phasers, Mr. Worf.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.132
Delta evasion plan initiated.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.262
Limit targets
to engines and shields.

03:33.305 --> 03:34.363
Aye, sir.

03:34.406 --> 03:35.896
Ready.

03:35.941 --> 03:37.704
Fire.

03:40.745 --> 03:42.110
Direct hit, sir.

03:42.147 --> 03:44.513
Moderate damage
to their aft shield generators.

03:44.549 --> 03:46.517
Continue phaser fire.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.884
Multiple hits, sir.

03:49.921 --> 03:52.287
Power failure
in their forward shields.

03:52.324 --> 03:55.384
The Cardassian ship
is standing down, sir.

03:57.162 --> 03:59.187
Well, let's see
if they'll answer

03:59.231 --> 04:00.698
our hail now, Mr. Worf.

04:00.732 --> 04:02.495
Frequency open.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.229
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

04:04.269 --> 04:06.260
of the Federation
Starship <i>Enterprise. </i>

04:07.973 --> 04:12.876
I am Gul Macet,
of the Cardassian ship <i>Trager. </i>

04:12.911 --> 04:14.845
Why have you fired on us?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.904
A curious question, Captain.

04:16.947 --> 04:21.009
In war,
one attacks one's enemies.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.613
There is a treaty
between our peoples.

04:24.656 --> 04:28.251
Perhaps that fact was unknown
to the Federation starship

04:28.293 --> 04:31.729
which destroyed our space
station in the Cuellar system

04:31.763 --> 04:33.253
two days ago.

04:33.298 --> 04:35.095
Federation starship?

04:35.133 --> 04:39.467
Attacked an unarmed
science station.

04:39.504 --> 04:42.996
They had barely enough time
to send an emergency signal

04:43.041 --> 04:45.976
before they were incinerated.

04:46.011 --> 04:49.606
Gul Macet, the Federation
and the Cardassians

04:49.648 --> 04:53.015
have struggled too hard
for peace

04:53.051 --> 04:55.611
to abandon it so easily.

04:55.654 --> 05:00.182
We are not the ones
who have abandoned it, Captain.

05:00.225 --> 05:04.958
Let me talk to my superiors,
find out what is behind this.

05:04.996 --> 05:07.123
Give me one hour.

05:07.232 --> 05:08.494
The alternative is for us

05:08.533 --> 05:10.228
to continue firing
at one another.

05:10.268 --> 05:14.932
And in such a contest,
you would be at a disadvantage.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.769
Very well.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.175
One hour.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:54.914 --> 05:59.317
Space, the final frontier.

05:59.351 --> 06:03.082
These are the voyages
of the Starship <i>Enterprise. </i>

06:03.155 --> 06:05.089
Its continuing mission...

06:05.157 --> 06:09.093
to explore strange new worlds

06:09.128 --> 06:13.565
to seek out new life
and new civilizations

06:13.599 --> 06:17.933
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.629
Captain, we've confirmed
your report.

07:20.664 --> 07:22.689
It was the Starship <i>Phoenix</i>

07:22.733 --> 07:26.225
under the command
of Benjamin Maxwell.

07:26.270 --> 07:28.295
Ben Maxwell...

07:28.339 --> 07:32.070
but he's one of Starfleet's
finest Captains.

07:32.109 --> 07:33.770
He... he must have
had provocation.

07:33.811 --> 07:35.073
I wish we knew.

07:35.145 --> 07:36.772
He's gone on silent running.

07:36.814 --> 07:39.078
Doesn't answer our communiques.

07:39.116 --> 07:41.084
Then he's still
in Cardassian space?

07:41.118 --> 07:44.986
The station he destroyed
was in Sector 21505.

07:45.022 --> 07:47.047
You're the nearest starship.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.322
We want you to go in
and find him.

07:50.361 --> 07:52.921
Will the Cardassians cooperate?

07:52.963 --> 07:54.988
They've granted you
safe passage.

07:55.032 --> 07:57.398
We've agreed that you'll take
along a delegation

07:57.434 --> 08:00.460
of observers,
as a show of good faith.

08:02.339 --> 08:05.831
Jean-Luc, I don't have
to tell you

08:05.876 --> 08:11.678
the Federation is not prepared
for a new sustained conflict.

08:11.715 --> 08:14.183
You must preserve the peace

08:14.218 --> 08:17.187
no matter what the cost.

08:19.156 --> 08:20.953
Haden out.

08:27.731 --> 08:31.258
There will be three Cardassians
transporting aboard.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.462
Their Captain, Gul Macet,
and two of his aides.

08:33.504 --> 08:35.995
My intention is to be
as open as possible with them.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.634
Allow them to share
in our search for the <i>Phoenix. </i>

08:38.676 --> 08:40.337
Captain, it is necessary

08:40.376 --> 08:42.607
to assign them
a security detail.

08:42.645 --> 08:43.738
They're our guests, Mr. Worf.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.339
I don't want them to feel
like prisoners.

08:45.382 --> 08:47.043
I tend to agree
with Mr. Worf, Captain.

08:47.084 --> 08:49.644
I think we should limit their
access while they're on board.

08:49.687 --> 08:51.985
I don't think they need
to have the run of the ship.

08:52.022 --> 08:53.580
At least allow me to post guards

08:53.624 --> 08:55.785
in some of the sensitive areas
of the ship.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.294
Very well.
Let's limit their access

08:58.329 --> 09:01.787
but you instruct your people
they are our guests.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.424
Aye, sir.

09:03.467 --> 09:04.729
Counselor, I want you to stay

09:04.768 --> 09:06.235
as close to the crew
as possible.

09:06.270 --> 09:08.602
Some of them may feel
uncomfortable

09:08.639 --> 09:10.266
with Cardassians on board.

09:10.307 --> 09:12.036
I don't want any incidents.

09:12.076 --> 09:14.271
Yes, Captain.

09:14.311 --> 09:15.938
Mr. Data, is there
anyone else on board

09:15.980 --> 09:18.312
who served previously
with Captain Benjamin Maxwell?

09:18.349 --> 09:20.715
Accessing.

09:20.751 --> 09:23.242
Chief O'Brien served
under his command

09:23.287 --> 09:24.879
aboard the <i>Rutledge, </i> sir.

09:24.922 --> 09:27.049
Indeed.

09:28.258 --> 09:29.953
Number One, will you
and the Counselor

09:29.994 --> 09:31.859
meet our guests
in Transporter Room Three?

09:31.895 --> 09:34.193
And inform Chief O'Brien
I will be calling on him.

09:34.231 --> 09:36.392
Yes, sir.

09:43.273 --> 09:45.332
Welcome to the <i>Enterprise. </i>

09:45.376 --> 09:46.968
I'm First Officer William Riker.

09:47.011 --> 09:49.605
Counselor Deanna Troi.

09:49.647 --> 09:51.979
I am Gul Macet.

09:52.016 --> 09:54.849
My aides, Glinn Daro

09:54.885 --> 09:56.512
Glinn Telle.

09:56.553 --> 09:58.282
This is our Transporter Chief

09:58.322 --> 10:00.620
Mr. O'Brien.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.987
Shall we?

10:20.465 --> 10:22.194
Captain's Log, supplemental.

10:22.234 --> 10:24.065
We have entered
Cardassian territory

10:24.135 --> 10:27.502
and are proceeding on our quest
to locate the <i>Phoenix. </i>

10:27.539 --> 10:28.870
And with long-range sensors

10:28.907 --> 10:32.240
we've been scanning a radius
of ten light-years.

10:32.277 --> 10:35.075
We can effectively scan
one sector a day.

10:35.180 --> 10:36.579
We're scanning Sector 21505 now.

10:36.615 --> 10:39.584
And there's still no sign
of the <i>Phoenix. </i>

10:39.618 --> 10:42.212
In fact, you have no assurance

10:42.254 --> 10:45.189
that the ship is still
in Sector 21505.

10:45.223 --> 10:47.418
In fact, we have no idea
where it is.

10:47.459 --> 10:49.324
We thought
the last known coordinates

10:49.361 --> 10:53.525
were a reasonably good place
to start.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.226
Captain Picard

10:55.267 --> 10:59.101
you can understand
that we are skeptical.

10:59.204 --> 11:01.866
Do you expect us to believe
that you are using

11:01.907 --> 11:05.707
every means at your disposal
to track down one of your own?

11:05.744 --> 11:08.577
Of course you are concerned,
Gul Macet.

11:08.613 --> 11:11.275
It is precisely
because of that fact

11:11.316 --> 11:15.275
that I have included you
in every aspect of our effort.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.947
You're present with my staff.

11:16.988 --> 11:19.320
You're hearing reports
as I hear them.

11:19.357 --> 11:22.588
Nothing edited,
nothing withheld.

11:22.627 --> 11:23.787
Very well.

11:23.828 --> 11:28.390
Transporter Chief O'Brien served
with Benjamin Maxwell.

11:28.433 --> 11:32.062
I thought that he might be able
to provide some insights.

11:32.170 --> 11:34.764
Mr. O'Brien, I understand

11:34.806 --> 11:37.036
that Captain Maxwell lost
his family

11:37.075 --> 11:38.906
during a raid on an outpost.

11:38.944 --> 11:40.844
More like sabotage, sir.

11:40.879 --> 11:42.972
It was on Setlik III.

11:43.014 --> 11:47.610
A squad of Cardassian militia
made a sneak raid on an outpost.

11:47.652 --> 11:50.212
Wiped out
close to 100 civilians.

11:50.255 --> 11:52.746
Then it's revenge he's after.

11:52.791 --> 11:55.055
That's not what I meant.

11:55.093 --> 11:57.653
Maxwell is taking retribution
for his own loss.

11:57.696 --> 11:59.630
Captain Maxwell would never...

11:59.664 --> 12:01.928
Gentlemen, please, let's not
indulge in speculation.

12:01.967 --> 12:06.529
Can we confine our discussion
to the facts?

12:06.571 --> 12:08.129
Now, Mr. O'Brien...

12:08.173 --> 12:09.800
Worf to Captain Picard.

12:09.841 --> 12:11.365
Go ahead, Mr. Worf.

12:11.409 --> 12:14.503
Long-range sensors have located
the <i>Phoenix. </i>

12:14.546 --> 12:18.812
Gul Macet, will you join me
on the Bridge?

12:33.765 --> 12:35.062
Deck six.

12:36.668 --> 12:37.828
Deck ten.

12:48.013 --> 12:50.504
Your Captain is most impressive.

12:50.548 --> 12:53.676
Yes, he is.

12:53.718 --> 12:56.278
Chief O'Brien

12:56.321 --> 12:59.256
our transporting system
is still operating

12:59.290 --> 13:01.383
with active feed
pattern buffers.

13:01.426 --> 13:04.884
I would like to talk with you
about your technology.

13:04.929 --> 13:06.021
I'll have to get

13:06.064 --> 13:08.555
Commander La Forge's
approval on that.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.125
I understand.

13:11.169 --> 13:12.864
In the meantime

13:12.904 --> 13:15.964
we're going to your Ten-Forward.

13:16.007 --> 13:17.634
Will you join us?

13:19.978 --> 13:21.536
If my Commander tells me

13:21.579 --> 13:25.606
to discuss the transporter
with you, I will.

13:25.650 --> 13:28.244
If Captain Picard orders me
to tell you everything I know

13:28.286 --> 13:30.948
about Ben Maxwell, I will.

13:32.323 --> 13:35.724
But who I choose
to spend my free time with

13:35.760 --> 13:37.853
that's my business.

13:49.808 --> 13:54.040
Captain, the <i>Phoenix</i>
is in Sector 21505.

13:54.079 --> 13:55.944
Ensign, set a course, warp six.

13:55.980 --> 13:58.244
Mr. Worf,
send a message by subspace.

13:58.283 --> 14:00.376
Tell them to prepare
for a rendezvous.

14:00.418 --> 14:01.385
Yes, Captain.

14:01.419 --> 14:03.478
Captain, a suggestion?

14:03.521 --> 14:04.783
Yes.

14:04.823 --> 14:08.259
We have a number
of ships in Sector 21505.

14:08.293 --> 14:11.956
If you will give us
more precise coordinates

14:11.996 --> 14:15.432
and the ship's coded
transponder frequency

14:15.467 --> 14:18.027
we would be able
to intercept Maxwell

14:18.069 --> 14:19.934
far more quickly than you.

14:19.971 --> 14:21.529
I'm sure that's true.

14:21.573 --> 14:23.905
However, given the circumstances

14:23.942 --> 14:27.673
I would prefer to make
the initial contact myself.

14:27.712 --> 14:29.043
I'm sure you would

14:29.114 --> 14:30.706
if the situation were reversed.

14:30.748 --> 14:33.308
Captain, time is crucial.

14:33.351 --> 14:35.911
You have a dangerous
man out there

14:35.954 --> 14:38.684
with a huge arsenal
at his command.

14:38.723 --> 14:41.590
If he is intent upon
revenge against my people

14:41.626 --> 14:44.891
he must be stopped
before he can do more damage.

14:44.929 --> 14:47.989
Captain, so far, we have
an isolated incident.

14:48.032 --> 14:49.659
If I can reach him first

14:49.701 --> 14:51.532
then perhaps
diplomacy can prevail

14:51.569 --> 14:54.265
but if one of your ships
should decide to retaliate

14:54.305 --> 14:55.397
there is a danger

14:55.440 --> 14:57.704
we could lose control
of the situation.

14:57.742 --> 14:59.767
Then you will not
give us the means

14:59.811 --> 15:01.540
to find his precise location?

15:01.579 --> 15:03.638
No, I won't.

15:09.954 --> 15:12.855
There you are.

15:12.891 --> 15:15.917
Potato casserole,
a dish fit for kings.

15:24.502 --> 15:26.333
What's that you're singing?

15:26.371 --> 15:27.338
What?

15:27.372 --> 15:29.203
Oh, it's just an old song.

15:31.209 --> 15:33.837
A bunch of us used to sing it
together on the <i>Rutledge. </i>

15:33.878 --> 15:36.346
I hadn't thought
about it in years.

15:36.381 --> 15:38.042
What's it about?

15:38.149 --> 15:41.983
Oh, it's about war and glory.

16:02.941 --> 16:05.933
Captain Maxwell
always liked that song.

16:05.977 --> 16:09.003
I guess it's all this business
about him and the Cardassians

16:09.080 --> 16:11.412
brought it back to me.

16:11.449 --> 16:14.577
You know, sitting
with the staff this morning

16:14.619 --> 16:17.645
I could tell
there were people in that room

16:17.689 --> 16:20.453
who still don't like
the Cardassians.

16:20.491 --> 16:23.153
I imagine that's to be expected.

16:23.194 --> 16:24.684
You do?

16:24.729 --> 16:26.287
Sure, the war lasted
a long time.

16:26.331 --> 16:27.696
That takes its toll on people.

16:27.732 --> 16:29.666
What are these little,
dark things?

16:29.701 --> 16:31.828
Capers.

16:31.869 --> 16:34.030
But the fighting's over now.

16:34.105 --> 16:36.801
Why should anyone still feel...

16:36.841 --> 16:38.672
however they feel?

16:38.710 --> 16:41.338
You fought the Cardassians,
didn't you?

16:41.379 --> 16:44.644
Well, there were some skirmishes
when I was with Captain Maxwell.

16:44.682 --> 16:47.310
Well, how do you feel
about them?

16:47.352 --> 16:49.377
Me?

16:49.420 --> 16:51.149
Well, I feel fine.

16:51.189 --> 16:53.783
I mean, the war's over now.

16:59.572 --> 17:01.597
The pursuing ship
is the <i>Phoenix. </i>

17:01.641 --> 17:03.632
And the other?

17:03.676 --> 17:06.702
It appears to be
a Cardassian supply ship.

17:06.746 --> 17:08.509
How would you know that?

17:08.548 --> 17:12.143
We are able to make
that determination.

17:12.185 --> 17:15.211
You can read
our transponder codes.

17:15.255 --> 17:16.744
The important thing
at the moment

17:16.789 --> 17:18.848
is that one of your ships
may be in jeopardy.

17:18.892 --> 17:21.724
Mr. Worf, has there been any
answer to our communication?

17:21.761 --> 17:23.228
No, Captain.

17:23.262 --> 17:25.628
Put out a repeating message
on all subspace channels.

17:25.665 --> 17:26.790
Priority one communique.

17:26.833 --> 17:28.323
Break off your pursuit
immediately.

17:28.367 --> 17:29.665
Aye, sir.

17:29.702 --> 17:31.932
Gul Macet, you see
we are doing everything

17:31.971 --> 17:33.734
in our power to reach
the <i>Phoenix. </i>

17:33.773 --> 17:37.265
Yes, and accomplishing nothing,
I'm sorry to say.

17:37.310 --> 17:39.369
Can you show me the location

17:39.412 --> 17:41.004
of our other ships?

17:41.047 --> 17:42.207
Mr. Data?

17:43.283 --> 17:45.217
There, you see?

17:45.251 --> 17:47.549
We have a warship
which could intercept

17:47.587 --> 17:49.555
the <i>Phoenix</i> before it's too late

17:49.589 --> 17:52.422
if you will give us
the transponder frequency.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.188
Or are you going to stand there

17:55.228 --> 17:58.425
while our ship
is destroyed, Captain?

18:04.737 --> 18:06.637
Mr. Worf

18:06.673 --> 18:09.039
has there been
any response to our hails?

18:10.510 --> 18:12.535
No, Captain.

18:15.848 --> 18:17.577
Very well.

18:19.752 --> 18:21.743
Mr. Worf...

18:27.126 --> 18:29.651
relay the prefix codes
of the <i>Phoenix</i>

18:29.696 --> 18:31.527
to the Cardassian warship.

18:31.564 --> 18:35.159
Sir, they will be able
to dismantle its shields.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.328
The <i>Phoenix</i>
will not have a chance.

18:37.370 --> 18:41.033
I cannot allow Maxwell
to ambush that supply ship.

18:42.809 --> 18:44.936
Mr. Worf, now!

18:46.613 --> 18:48.444
Yes, Captain.

19:01.561 --> 19:04.553
Sir, the Cardassian warship
is moving on the <i>Phoenix. </i>

19:04.597 --> 19:08.556
Mr. Data, overlay
weapon ranges of the two ships.

19:10.436 --> 19:12.529
The warship is 300,000
kilometers from the <i>Phoenix. </i>

19:12.572 --> 19:15.507
It is opening fire.

19:15.541 --> 19:17.975
The <i>Phoenix</i> has taken
a direct hit.

19:18.044 --> 19:21.673
The <i>Phoenix</i>
is beginning evasive maneuvers.

19:21.714 --> 19:23.579
It has positioned itself outside

19:23.616 --> 19:25.948
the weapons range
of the opposing ship.

19:27.487 --> 19:29.216
The <i>Phoenix</i> has powered up

19:29.255 --> 19:32.190
both phasers
and photon torpedoes.

19:34.293 --> 19:37.524
The <i>Phoenix</i> is firing
photon torpedoes.

19:42.201 --> 19:45.170
He has destroyed our warship.

19:46.706 --> 19:49.004
Does the supply ship
have any weapons?

19:50.843 --> 19:52.470
Very limited.

19:52.512 --> 19:54.241
Certainly not enough

19:54.280 --> 19:57.443
to defeat
a Nebula-class starship.

19:57.483 --> 20:00.714
Sir, the <i>Phoenix</i> is firing
on the...

20:00.753 --> 20:05.554
The warship carried
a crew of 600.

20:05.591 --> 20:08.651
The supply ship, 50.

20:08.695 --> 20:13.155
Mr. Data, estimated time
to intercept with the <i>Phoenix? </i>

20:13.199 --> 20:15.497
At our present speed
of warp four

20:15.535 --> 20:17.332
16 hours, 44 minutes.

20:17.370 --> 20:20.771
Ensign, increase to warp nine.

20:35.021 --> 20:36.318
Captain.

20:36.355 --> 20:38.983
Chief, I wanted to talk to you.

20:39.025 --> 20:42.324
Anything I can do, sir.
You know that.

20:42.361 --> 20:45.819
Ben Maxwell...
he must be quite a man.

20:45.865 --> 20:47.162
He's a rare one, all right.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.929
I count myself lucky, sir.

20:48.968 --> 20:52.631
I've served with the two
finest Captains in Starfleet.

20:54.407 --> 20:58.036
From your knowledge of the man,
what has gone wrong?

20:58.077 --> 21:01.376
Well, there's a reason
for what he's doing.

21:01.414 --> 21:03.507
Those Cardassians
were up to something.

21:03.549 --> 21:06.017
I'm sure of it.

21:06.119 --> 21:09.577
When his family was killed,
how did he take it?

21:09.622 --> 21:11.920
I'd say he took it well.

21:11.958 --> 21:14.426
Oh, I know
he was broken up inside.

21:14.460 --> 21:15.757
Who wouldn't be?

21:15.795 --> 21:18.161
But you'd never
know it to see him.

21:18.197 --> 21:20.427
He never missed a minute's duty.

21:20.466 --> 21:23.026
Always had a smile, a joke.

21:23.136 --> 21:25.297
Hmm. I see.

21:25.338 --> 21:27.169
He would never retaliate
out of vengeance

21:27.206 --> 21:28.798
no matter what
that Cardassian says

21:28.841 --> 21:30.638
They're up to something, sir.

21:30.676 --> 21:33.645
They're the ones you
should be investigating

21:33.679 --> 21:34.976
not Captain Maxwell.

21:35.014 --> 21:36.982
You don't care
for the Cardassians.

21:37.016 --> 21:39.985
Oh, I like them fine.

21:40.019 --> 21:41.452
It's just...

21:41.487 --> 21:43.182
Well, I know them.

21:43.222 --> 21:46.783
You learn to watch your back
when you're around those people.

21:46.826 --> 21:50.922
Ben Maxwell has just sent
more than 600 of them

21:50.963 --> 21:53.022
to their deaths.

21:53.065 --> 21:55.363
I don't know what to say, sir

21:55.401 --> 21:58.370
but he must have had
his reasons.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.901
I think...

22:02.942 --> 22:05.001
when one has been angry
for a very long time

22:05.111 --> 22:06.908
one gets used to it.

22:06.946 --> 22:09.471
And it becomes comfortable

22:09.515 --> 22:11.881
like... like old leather.

22:13.152 --> 22:16.212
And finally...

22:16.255 --> 22:17.916
it becomes so familiar

22:17.957 --> 22:20.755
that one can't ever remember
feeling any other way.

22:23.162 --> 22:25.153
Thank you, Chief.

22:46.144 --> 22:48.169
<i>Kanar. </i>

22:54.018 --> 22:56.009
Mind if I join you?

22:58.256 --> 23:00.224
You want another?

23:01.993 --> 23:03.961
And an ale.

23:06.464 --> 23:08.932
<i>Kanar. </i>

23:08.967 --> 23:12.368
I never could develop
a taste for it.

23:12.403 --> 23:15.270
It takes a bit
of getting used to.

23:17.709 --> 23:20.542
I wanted to say I...

23:20.578 --> 23:22.170
I owe you an apology.

23:22.213 --> 23:24.738
I shouldn't have
popped off like that

23:24.782 --> 23:26.249
in the turbolift.

23:26.284 --> 23:27.512
I think...

23:27.552 --> 23:29.679
Here's your ale, Mr. O'Brien.

23:29.721 --> 23:33.213
This has been hard on all of us.

23:33.258 --> 23:37.661
I know I'll be happy
when I'm back on my own ship.

23:37.695 --> 23:39.322
I guess that's true.

23:39.364 --> 23:41.696
I hadn't thought about that.

23:44.402 --> 23:46.370
I was on Setlik III
with Captain Maxwell

23:46.404 --> 23:49.601
the morning after the massacre.

23:51.709 --> 23:54.678
We were too late, of course.

23:56.214 --> 23:58.444
Almost everyone was dead.

23:58.483 --> 24:01.384
That was a terrible mistake.

24:01.419 --> 24:04.877
We were told the outpost
was a launching place

24:04.923 --> 24:08.256
for a massive attack
against us.

24:10.161 --> 24:13.494
The only people left alive

24:13.531 --> 24:16.227
were in an outlying
district of the settlement.

24:16.267 --> 24:19.668
I was sent there with a squad
to reinforce them.

24:19.704 --> 24:23.663
The Cardassians
were advancing on us...

24:23.708 --> 24:28.805
moving through the streets,
destroying, killing.

24:28.846 --> 24:31.508
I was with a group
of women and children

24:31.549 --> 24:35.246
when two Cardassian soldiers
burst in.

24:35.286 --> 24:37.254
I stunned one of them.

24:37.288 --> 24:39.256
The other one jumped me.

24:39.290 --> 24:42.123
We struggled.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.526
One of the women threw me
a phaser

24:44.562 --> 24:47.497
and I fired.

24:56.774 --> 25:00.005
The phaser was set at maximum.

25:00.044 --> 25:02.376
The man just...

25:02.413 --> 25:05.473
just incinerated there

25:05.516 --> 25:08.041
before my eyes.

25:08.086 --> 25:11.817
I'd never killed
anything before.

25:11.856 --> 25:13.949
When I was a kid

25:14.058 --> 25:17.858
I'd worry
about swatting a mosquito.

25:24.035 --> 25:27.436
It's not you I hate, Cardassian.

25:27.472 --> 25:31.806
I hate what I became
because of you.

25:42.387 --> 25:44.685
I will protest this, Klingon.

25:44.722 --> 25:46.713
Lieutenant?

25:46.758 --> 25:48.988
He was found
at a computer station on deck 35

25:49.093 --> 25:52.392
attempting to access information
on our weapons systems.

25:52.430 --> 25:54.728
A lie, Gul Macet.

25:54.766 --> 25:57.234
I was studying
the terminal interface systems.

25:57.268 --> 25:59.634
They're more efficient
than ours.

25:59.671 --> 26:02.606
I have no idea
what was in the files.

26:04.242 --> 26:06.210
What business did you have

26:06.244 --> 26:09.213
going near
one of their computers?

26:11.582 --> 26:14.176
But, Gul Macet, I meant nothing.

26:14.218 --> 26:15.947
There was no harm done.

26:16.054 --> 26:18.318
Go to your quarters.

26:18.356 --> 26:19.948
You're confined there

26:19.991 --> 26:22.516
for the duration
of this expedition.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.858
As you wish.

26:24.896 --> 26:26.386
Sir.

26:27.899 --> 26:30.299
Mr. Worf, please accompany him.

26:30.335 --> 26:32.326
Gladly, Captain.

26:40.478 --> 26:45.973
Captain, may we speak
in private?

26:46.017 --> 26:48.485
You have the Bridge, Number One.

26:59.731 --> 27:03.064
I deeply regret
what my aide has done, Captain.

27:03.101 --> 27:05.569
You have my word
he will be disciplined

27:05.603 --> 27:06.900
upon my return.

27:06.938 --> 27:08.769
You may take whatever action
against him

27:08.806 --> 27:09.932
you feel is appropriate.

27:10.007 --> 27:11.872
I consider the matter closed.

27:11.909 --> 27:14.537
I'm not sure
I would be so generous

27:14.579 --> 27:16.342
in your place, Captain.

27:16.381 --> 27:17.905
Thank you.

27:17.949 --> 27:20.918
If there is to be
a lasting peace, Gul Macet

27:20.952 --> 27:23.921
neither you nor I must allow
any one man

27:23.955 --> 27:26.287
to undermine our efforts.

27:34.465 --> 27:37.923
There are those who...

27:37.969 --> 27:40.267
crave war...

27:40.304 --> 27:42.636
who need it.

27:42.673 --> 27:45.642
I am not one of them, Captain

27:45.676 --> 27:51.137
and I'm beginning to see
that neither are you.

27:51.182 --> 27:54.379
We have had our full measure.

27:54.419 --> 27:58.150
The lasting peace begins here

27:58.189 --> 28:00.487
with the two of us.

28:00.525 --> 28:02.390
Bridge to Captain.

28:02.427 --> 28:04.156
Picard here.

28:04.195 --> 28:05.890
We have located
the <i>Phoenix, </i> sir.

28:05.930 --> 28:08.455
We will intercept it
in 22 minutes.

28:18.013 --> 28:22.313
Captain's Log, Stardate 44431.7.

28:22.350 --> 28:23.908
We have established
communication

28:23.952 --> 28:24.919
with Captain Maxwell

28:24.986 --> 28:26.977
and he has agreed
to come on board.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.918
Welcome aboard, sir.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.793
I'm Commander Riker,
First Officer.

28:35.830 --> 28:37.889
I know all about you, Commander.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.924
Fine work you did with the Borg.

28:40.035 --> 28:41.764
We all owe you on that one.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.634
Thank you, sir.

28:43.672 --> 28:44.639
O'Brien?

28:44.673 --> 28:46.664
Miles O'Brien?

28:46.708 --> 28:48.733
Hello, Captain.

28:48.777 --> 28:49.835
Good to see you again.

28:49.878 --> 28:50.936
How are you?

28:50.979 --> 28:52.947
I had no idea you were
on the <i>Enterprise. </i>

28:52.981 --> 28:55.108
This was my tactical officer
on the <i>Rutledge. </i>

28:55.150 --> 28:56.742
Best I ever had.

28:56.785 --> 28:57.877
Thank you, sir.

28:57.919 --> 28:59.580
O'Brien has the ability

28:59.621 --> 29:01.418
to size up a situation instantly

29:01.456 --> 29:04.289
then come up with options
to fit all contingencies.

29:04.326 --> 29:05.418
Remarkable!

29:05.460 --> 29:08.156
Well, if that's true,
I learned it from you, sir.

29:08.196 --> 29:11.632
But you got that silver tongue
by kissing the stone

29:11.666 --> 29:13.657
right?

29:15.337 --> 29:18.568
Well, Commander, best I see
your Captain straight away.

29:18.607 --> 29:20.632
We've got a lot to talk about.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.438
Yes, sir.

29:38.193 --> 29:42.323
Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
Captain Benjamin Maxwell.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.696
That will be all, Commander.

29:46.701 --> 29:47.929
Captain.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.503
A pleasure, Captain.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.528
Please sit down.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.803
You must think I've gone mad.

29:59.114 --> 30:01.082
The thought had occurred.

30:01.116 --> 30:03.107
Picard, I have to tell you.

30:03.151 --> 30:06.143
I was grateful
when I realized it was you

30:06.187 --> 30:08.382
Starfleet had sent after me...

30:08.423 --> 30:11.517
someone who knows what
it's really like out here.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.891
I know of nothing out here
that could possibly justify

30:13.928 --> 30:15.862
what you have done.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.195
Then listen to this.

30:18.233 --> 30:21.066
The Cardassians
are arming again.

30:21.102 --> 30:23.195
That so-called science station?

30:23.238 --> 30:26.366
Military supply port.

30:26.408 --> 30:27.773
How do you know this?

30:27.809 --> 30:29.868
Information comes my way.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.742
From whom?

30:31.780 --> 30:33.543
Where is your documentation?

30:33.581 --> 30:35.139
I know what they're doing!

30:35.183 --> 30:37.845
I can smell it.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.215
There's no good reason
for a science station

30:42.257 --> 30:43.815
in the Cuellar system.

30:43.858 --> 30:45.553
But it's
a hell of a strategic site

30:45.593 --> 30:47.561
for a military
transport station...

30:47.595 --> 30:50.655
a jumping-off point
into three Federation sectors.

30:50.699 --> 30:54.135
They're running supply ships
back and forth.

30:54.169 --> 30:57.400
And nobody's going to tell me
it's for scientific research.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.805
But whatever circumstances
you encountered

30:59.841 --> 31:01.706
why didn't you notify Starfleet?

31:01.743 --> 31:04.541
And wait six months

31:04.579 --> 31:08.037
while the bureaucrats
sit around reading reports

31:08.083 --> 31:10.381
trying to figure out
what to do?

31:10.418 --> 31:13.410
They don't know
what's going on out here.

31:15.390 --> 31:17.517
But you should, Picard.

31:17.559 --> 31:20.494
You know what it's like
to be under fire.

31:20.528 --> 31:22.393
You weren't under fire.

31:22.430 --> 31:23.954
Lives were at stake.

31:24.065 --> 31:24.963
Whose lives?

31:25.066 --> 31:26.897
We had to act now!

31:26.935 --> 31:28.425
Why?

31:32.340 --> 31:35.503
Smells musty in here...

31:35.543 --> 31:38.706
like a bureaucrat's office.

31:38.747 --> 31:41.648
You have killed
nearly 700 people

31:41.683 --> 31:45.141
and you have taken us
to the brink of war.

31:45.186 --> 31:46.710
I have prevented war

31:46.755 --> 31:49.883
or at the very least delayed it
a good long time.

31:49.924 --> 31:53.189
The peace treaty was a ruse,
to give them breathing room

31:53.228 --> 31:54.718
time to regroup.

31:54.763 --> 31:58.199
And so, all alone, you decided
to dispose of the treaty.

31:58.233 --> 31:59.894
I took the initiative.

31:59.934 --> 32:02.027
I did what had to be done.

32:02.070 --> 32:03.731
What had to be done?

32:03.772 --> 32:06.536
Hmm? For whom?

32:06.574 --> 32:08.269
Why would a man

32:08.309 --> 32:10.504
with a long
and brilliant service

32:10.545 --> 32:12.877
abandon
the fundamental principles

32:12.914 --> 32:16.042
that he has believed in...
even fought for...

32:16.084 --> 32:18.678
all of his life?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.415
Well, I believe

32:20.455 --> 32:23.424
it is because of what they did
to your wife

32:23.458 --> 32:24.948
and your children.

32:25.059 --> 32:26.287
Not true... not true.

32:26.327 --> 32:28.557
To avenge their deaths.

32:33.902 --> 32:36.871
You're a fool, Picard.

32:36.905 --> 32:41.399
History will look at you
and say, "This man was a fool."

32:42.744 --> 32:45.338
I'll accept the judgment
of history.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.872
When it becomes clear
what the Cardassians have done

32:48.917 --> 32:50.908
I will be vindicated.

32:50.952 --> 32:54.888
What the Cardassians have
or have not done is irrelevant.

32:54.923 --> 32:57.391
Irrelevant?!

32:57.425 --> 32:58.517
Then come with me.

32:58.560 --> 33:02.496
Find one of their supply ships
and we'll see

33:02.530 --> 33:04.327
how "irrelevant" it is.

33:04.365 --> 33:08.563
We're not going after
any more Cardassian ships.

33:08.603 --> 33:11.902
You're going
to return to your Bridge

33:11.940 --> 33:15.842
and set a course
for Starbase 211.

33:15.877 --> 33:18.471
The <i>Phoenix</i> and the
<i>Enterprise</i> will return

33:18.513 --> 33:20.481
to Federation space together.

33:20.515 --> 33:22.847
Those are Starfleet's orders.

33:24.519 --> 33:27.955
I will permit you the dignity

33:28.022 --> 33:31.150
of retaining your command
during the voyage

33:31.192 --> 33:34.821
but the only alternative
is to put you in the brig

33:34.863 --> 33:38.424
and to tow your ship back
to the Starbase in disgrace.

33:44.539 --> 33:47.201
I will return to my ship.

33:47.242 --> 33:50.541
You understand your orders?

33:50.578 --> 33:52.546
Yes, Captain.

33:52.580 --> 33:55.981
Mr. Worf, report
to my ready room.

33:56.050 --> 33:57.677
My guest is departing.

33:57.719 --> 33:59.744
Aye, sir.

34:09.775 --> 34:11.801
Captain's Log, supplemental.

34:11.844 --> 34:14.143
With the <i>Phoenix</i>
in close formation

34:14.181 --> 34:17.014
we are proceeding directly
to Starbase 211.

34:17.050 --> 34:19.541
Mr. Data, how long until
we clear Cardassian space?

34:19.585 --> 34:22.885
At our present speed,
three hours, 20 minutes, sir.

34:22.989 --> 34:25.356
Mr. Worf, send a message
to Admiral Haden at Starfleet.

34:25.391 --> 34:27.326
Inform them of
our projected time of arrival.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.886
Aye, sir.

34:29.996 --> 34:33.398
Captain, the <i>Phoenix</i>
has changed course.

34:38.405 --> 34:40.737
What is he doing?

34:40.774 --> 34:43.106
Ensign, change course to pursue.

34:44.777 --> 34:47.746
Mr. Worf, will you hail
Captain Maxwell?

34:47.781 --> 34:50.716
No response, Captain.

34:50.751 --> 34:52.844
Data, project his new course.

34:52.886 --> 34:55.320
The <i>Phoenix</i> is headed directly
for a Cardassian vessel

34:55.355 --> 34:57.346
.12 light-years
from our location.

34:57.391 --> 35:01.020
He'll attack that ship,
just as he did the others.

35:01.061 --> 35:02.653
Continue the hail, Mr. Worf.

35:02.696 --> 35:05.187
Priority one message.

35:05.232 --> 35:07.757
Do you know
what that ship might be?

35:07.801 --> 35:11.066
I imagine it's a supply ship

35:11.104 --> 35:14.335
headed for the research station
in the Kelrabi system.

35:14.374 --> 35:17.172
The <i>Phoenix</i> still
does not respond, sir.

35:17.210 --> 35:19.440
Ensign, warp eight.
Overtake him.

35:19.479 --> 35:21.879
Captain, the <i>Phoenix</i> has
accelerated to warp nine.

35:21.982 --> 35:23.609
We will not be able to reach him

35:23.650 --> 35:25.777
before he intercepts
the Cardassian vessel.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.218
Ensign, warp nine.

35:27.254 --> 35:28.721
Aye, sir.

35:28.755 --> 35:30.450
Mr. Worf, arm phasers.

35:30.490 --> 35:31.855
Continue the hail.

35:31.892 --> 35:33.223
Aye, sir.

35:33.260 --> 35:36.718
Captain, Chief O'Brien was
Maxwell's tactical officer.

35:36.763 --> 35:38.856
Get him up here.

35:41.735 --> 35:44.898
Sir, the <i>Phoenix</i> has
dropped out of warp.

35:44.938 --> 35:47.463
They have reached
the Cardassian vessel.

35:47.507 --> 35:49.099
Slow to impulse.

35:49.142 --> 35:51.042
Vessels are within visual range.

35:51.078 --> 35:52.602
On screen.

35:54.214 --> 35:56.842
Has the <i>Phoenix</i> activated
its weapons systems?

35:56.883 --> 35:57.907
Negative, sir.

35:58.018 --> 35:59.815
Their phaser banks
are not armed.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.377
What about the Cardassians?

36:01.421 --> 36:04.686
Sensors are unable
to determine the status

36:04.725 --> 36:06.488
of the Cardassian
defensive systems.

36:06.526 --> 36:08.585
Their ship is running
with a high-powered

36:08.628 --> 36:10.721
subspace field.

36:12.766 --> 36:16.532
Mr. O'Brien,
your former Commander

36:16.570 --> 36:18.561
a Federation Captain,
is about to place me

36:18.605 --> 36:20.402
in the position
of firing on his ship.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.374
I need your knowledge
of the man

36:22.409 --> 36:25.867
how he thinks,
what he's capable of doing.

36:25.979 --> 36:27.105
Aye, sir.

36:27.147 --> 36:29.377
Sir, Captain Maxwell
is hailing us.

36:29.416 --> 36:31.247
On screen.

36:32.919 --> 36:34.887
All right, Picard.

36:34.921 --> 36:36.286
You need proof?

36:36.323 --> 36:37.881
You've got it now.

36:37.991 --> 36:41.154
Captain Maxwell, you have
disobeyed a direct order.

36:41.194 --> 36:42.559
Board the ship.

36:42.596 --> 36:45.394
You'll see that everything
I've been saying is true.

36:45.432 --> 36:48.333
The Cardassian vessel
will not be boarded.

36:48.368 --> 36:51.826
You will transport yourself
aboard the <i>Enterprise. </i>

36:51.872 --> 36:55.831
Picard, if you don't board
that ship

36:55.876 --> 36:58.003
I'll destroy it.

36:58.045 --> 37:01.105
And I will use
whatever force is necessary

37:01.148 --> 37:04.345
to prevent you from taking
that action, Captain.

37:08.255 --> 37:09.620
Sir, Captain Maxwell...

37:09.656 --> 37:12.420
if he feels his back
is against the wall

37:12.459 --> 37:13.790
he'll strike.

37:13.827 --> 37:16.227
Captain, the <i>Phoenix</i>
is transferring power

37:16.263 --> 37:17.355
to its shields.

37:17.397 --> 37:18.864
They are arming phasers

37:18.965 --> 37:20.728
and loading forward
torpedo bays.

37:20.767 --> 37:21.756
Red Alert.

37:21.802 --> 37:23.531
Seems you were right,
Mr. O'Brien.

37:23.570 --> 37:25.367
Ready phasers, load torpedoes.

37:25.405 --> 37:26.497
Phasers armed.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.701
Loading forward
and aft torpedo bays.

37:28.742 --> 37:30.710
Sir, let me beam over.

37:30.744 --> 37:32.712
Try to talk to him.

37:32.746 --> 37:34.441
We served together a long time.

37:34.481 --> 37:36.506
When you've been through
what we have

37:36.550 --> 37:38.279
you tend to get inside someone.

37:38.318 --> 37:39.376
He might listen.

37:39.419 --> 37:40.852
He'd never lower his shields

37:40.887 --> 37:42.650
and allow you
to transport on board.

37:42.689 --> 37:46.147
The <i>Phoenix</i> is using
a high-energy sensor system.

37:46.193 --> 37:47.990
It cycles every 5.5 minutes.

37:48.028 --> 37:50.895
Between cycles, there's a window
of a 50th of a second.

37:50.997 --> 37:53.261
Trust me.
I can get through.

37:53.300 --> 37:55.291
Make it so.

38:04.644 --> 38:06.703
Not now!

38:12.452 --> 38:13.942
I'm not armed.

38:13.987 --> 38:16.649
How the devil
did you get over here?

38:16.690 --> 38:19.659
I had the thought
that if we could talk

38:19.693 --> 38:22.662
we could figure a way
out of this mess.

38:22.696 --> 38:24.425
The way out of this is clear.

38:24.464 --> 38:25.761
Talk to Picard.

38:25.799 --> 38:27.664
Get him to board the damn ship.

38:27.701 --> 38:29.635
He won't do that, sir.

38:29.669 --> 38:32.433
But he'd turn his weapons
on a Federation starship

38:32.472 --> 38:33.632
to protect the enemy?

38:33.673 --> 38:35.368
I don't believe it.

38:35.408 --> 38:36.375
He will.

38:36.409 --> 38:38.309
Count on it.

38:38.345 --> 38:42.247
What the hell has happened
to this war?

38:42.282 --> 38:44.807
Sir...

38:44.851 --> 38:47.843
there is no war.

38:47.888 --> 38:50.686
The war is over.

38:53.860 --> 38:55.828
You're wrong.

38:55.862 --> 38:58.490
The Cardassians live
to make war.

38:58.532 --> 39:01.433
That's what everybody thinks
about the enemy.

39:01.468 --> 39:04.437
That's probably
what they think about us.

39:04.471 --> 39:05.961
We're not the same at all.

39:06.006 --> 39:08.304
We do not start wars.

39:10.310 --> 39:14.269
We do not make surprise
attacks on manned outposts.

39:14.314 --> 39:18.341
We do not butcher women and
children in their homes.

39:19.719 --> 39:21.710
Children...

39:23.490 --> 39:27.017
who never had the
chance to grow up.

39:33.333 --> 39:36.097
You were with me on Setlik.

39:36.136 --> 39:38.798
You saw what they did.

39:38.838 --> 39:40.499
Yes, sir.

39:46.146 --> 39:47.841
What was the name of that fellow

39:47.881 --> 39:50.076
who always hung around you
like a puppy?

39:51.351 --> 39:53.342
Will Kayden.

39:55.355 --> 39:56.982
Stompie.

39:57.023 --> 39:59.150
Stompie!

40:02.329 --> 40:05.321
As cool under fire
as a mountain lake.

40:05.365 --> 40:07.356
Yes, sir.

40:13.206 --> 40:16.664
He died at Setlik, didn't he?

40:16.710 --> 40:18.644
Yes, sir.

40:22.382 --> 40:24.179
What was that song of his?

40:24.217 --> 40:26.344
The one he always sang?

40:26.386 --> 40:28.047
The one I liked?

41:33.453 --> 41:36.650
I'm not going to win
this one, am l, Chief?

41:39.059 --> 41:41.391
No, sir.

41:47.896 --> 41:49.864
Captain's Log, supplemental.

41:49.898 --> 41:52.731
Captain Maxwell has turned his
ship over to his First Officer

41:52.768 --> 41:54.736
and transported
aboard the <i>Enterprise. </i>

41:54.770 --> 41:58.729
I have confined him to quarters
for the return voyage.

41:58.774 --> 42:00.765
Thank you, Chief.

42:02.811 --> 42:06.941
I'd just like to say, sir,
he was a good man.

42:06.982 --> 42:10.782
What he did was terribly wrong,
I know that now

42:10.819 --> 42:13.982
but I'm still proud
to have served with him.

42:14.022 --> 42:15.956
Thank you, Chief.

42:15.991 --> 42:17.618
And well done.

42:17.659 --> 42:19.650
That'll be all.

42:22.931 --> 42:26.230
Well, his loyalty is admirable

42:26.268 --> 42:29.203
even if it is misplaced.

42:32.074 --> 42:34.304
The loyalty that you would
so quickly dismiss

42:34.343 --> 42:37.710
does not come easily
to my people, Gul Macet.

42:37.746 --> 42:40.715
You have much to learn about us.

42:40.749 --> 42:42.717
Benjamin Maxwell
earned the loyalty

42:42.751 --> 42:45.276
of those who served with him.

42:47.022 --> 42:51.083
You know, in war,
he was twice honored

42:51.126 --> 42:54.186
with the Federation's
highest citation

42:54.229 --> 42:56.789
for courage and valor.

42:56.832 --> 43:01.769
And if he could not find
a role for himself in peace

43:01.803 --> 43:06.433
we can pity him, but we
shall not dismiss him.

43:06.475 --> 43:09.501
You are welcome to
your opinion, Captain.

43:09.544 --> 43:15.107
l, for one, am grateful
he is under lock and key.

43:15.150 --> 43:17.380
One more thing, Gul Macet.

43:19.221 --> 43:22.190
Maxwell was right.

43:22.224 --> 43:26.092
Those ships were not carrying
scientific equipment, were they?

43:26.128 --> 43:29.825
A research station
within arm's reach

43:29.865 --> 43:32.356
of three Federation sectors?

43:32.401 --> 43:33.868
Cargo ships running

43:33.969 --> 43:36.563
with high-energy
subspace fields

43:36.605 --> 43:39.472
that jam sensors?

43:39.508 --> 43:41.874
If you believe
the transport ship

43:41.977 --> 43:44.138
was carrying weapons, Captain

43:44.179 --> 43:46.807
why didn't you board it

43:46.848 --> 43:48.645
as Maxwell requested?

43:50.118 --> 43:53.212
I was here
to protect the peace...

43:53.255 --> 43:56.884
a peace that I firmly believe
is in the interest

43:56.925 --> 43:58.222
of both our peoples.

43:58.260 --> 44:00.524
If I had attempted
to board that ship

44:00.562 --> 44:02.723
I'm quite certain that you and I

44:02.764 --> 44:05.824
would not be having
this pleasant conversation

44:05.867 --> 44:09.633
and that ships on both sides
would now be arming for war.

44:09.671 --> 44:11.502
Captain, I assure you...

44:11.540 --> 44:15.101
Take this message
to your leaders, Gul Macet.

44:15.143 --> 44:18.670
We'll be watching.
