WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:03.961
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.045 --> 00:06.047
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.800
- WE HAVE ON THE LINE WITH US
VICTORIA FROM CLEVELAND.

00:08.883 --> 00:11.428
TELL US, VICTORIA,
WHY ARE YOU SO EXCITED

00:11.511 --> 00:13.972
ABOUT THESE
AMAZING SPACE BAGS?

00:14.055 --> 00:15.265
- WELL, THE LOVE OF MY LIFE

00:15.348 --> 00:16.599
WAS RECENTLY THROWN
INTO PRISON,

00:16.683 --> 00:18.977
AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT JAIL CELLS

00:19.060 --> 00:22.105
HAVE NO CLOSET SPACE AT ALL.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.566
I'LL TAKE 500.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.776
- VICTORIA!

00:26.860 --> 00:28.570
MS. CHASE WILL NOT
BE PURCHASING

00:28.653 --> 00:29.446
SPACE BAGS AT THIS TIME.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.239
THANK YOU.

00:31.322 --> 00:34.617
- WHY ARE YOU
SHOP-BLOCKING ME?

00:34.701 --> 00:37.704
- I HEARD NOISES.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.915
- IS THAT THING LOADED?

00:40.999 --> 00:44.002
- ONE OF US IS.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.923
- WELL, WE'RE HAVING
AN INTERVENTION FOR VICTORIA.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.427
- BECAUSE OF HER DRINKING?

00:52.510 --> 00:53.762
- NO.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.138
- SHE'S GRIEF-SHOPPING.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.639
- OH, CAN YOU BLAME ME?

00:56.723 --> 00:59.309
EMMET'S IN JAIL,
I CAN'T SEE HIM,

00:59.392 --> 01:01.144
AND HIS LAWYERS WON'T TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.937
- OH, HONEY. I KNOW IT HURTS.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.022
BUT NOW
YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG.

01:05.105 --> 01:05.982
- OH, MELANIE,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE

01:06.065 --> 01:07.484
TRYING TO CHEER ME UP.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.319
YOU SHOULD BE BACK
AT YOUR APARTMENT WITH ALEC.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.988
JOY CAN STAY
AND KEEP ME COMPANY.

01:12.071 --> 01:15.658
SHE HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.160
- AGAIN FOR THE RECORD,

01:17.243 --> 01:19.078
I'M WORKING FOR
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

01:19.162 --> 01:20.121
AND GOING TO COLLEGE.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.539
- OH, SEE?

01:21.623 --> 01:26.211
JOY'S RICH FANTASY LIFE
WILL ENTERTAIN ME.

01:26.294 --> 01:28.046
- ALEC'S OUT OF TOWN,
SO I CAN BE HERE

01:28.129 --> 01:29.464
AS LONG AS YOU NEED ME.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.174
- WELL, THANK YOU.
- YOU KNOW...

01:31.257 --> 01:33.468
SOMETIMES THE BEST WAY
TO GET OVER

01:33.551 --> 01:35.345
FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF
IS TO DO SOMETHING NICE

01:35.428 --> 01:36.346
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.680
- YEAH, YEAH, "IN BED."

01:37.764 --> 01:40.558
WE'VE ALL GOTTEN
THAT FORTUNE COOKIE.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.477
- NO, I'M BEING SERIOUS.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.771
MY PR AGENCY REPRESENTS
THE KIDNEY FOUNDATION.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.064
AND <i> GOOD MORNING AMERICA</i>

01:46.147 --> 01:47.857
IS GONNA GIVE US
AN ON-AIR SPOT.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.569
SO WE NEED A BEAUTIFUL,
CHARISMATIC SPOKESPERSON.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.823
- [chuckles]
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.286
- SHE MEANT VICTORIA.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.164
- SELFLESS THROUGH
THE TEARS...

02:03.248 --> 02:05.875
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD ROLE
FOR ME.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.044
MELANIE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.545
I NEED TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT ME

02:09.628 --> 02:14.133
AND START THINKING ABOUT ME
ON TELEVISION.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.352
{\an8}- SO YOU THINK YOU'RE READY

02:24.435 --> 02:26.354
{\an8}FOR YOUR FIRST
DETECTIVE ASSIGNMENT, JOY?

02:26.437 --> 02:28.398
{\an8}- I KNOW I AM.
- GREAT.

02:28.481 --> 02:33.361
{\an8}'CAUSE I WANT YOU TO BE
MY HONEY TRAP.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.697
{\an8}- WHATEVER THAT IS,
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.241
{\an8}SO JUST TELL ME
WHAT THE ASSIGNMENT IS.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.118
{\an8}- THAT IS THE ASSIGNMENT.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.745
{\an8}A HONEY TRAP IS AN OPERATIVE

02:42.829 --> 02:45.999
{\an8}WHO TRAPS A SERIAL CHEATER
IN A COMPROMISING POSITION.

02:46.082 --> 02:49.043
{\an8}NOW THIS IS OUR MARK.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.796
{\an8}- OUR MARK.
[laughs]

02:51.880 --> 02:53.590
{\an8}THE BEST PART ABOUT BEING
A DETECTIVE

02:53.673 --> 02:55.174
{\an8}IS GETTING TO USE THE LINGO.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.595
{\an8}- LINGO?
NO, HIS NAME IS MARK.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.054
{\an8}- OH.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.765
{\an8}SO MARK'S OUR PATSY.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.310
{\an8}- NO, PATSY'S THE WIFE.
HERE.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.270
{\an8}SHE'S THE ONE THAT HIRED ME.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.480
{\an8}NOW YOU'RE GONNA MEET MARK
IN FRONT OF HIS OFFICE.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.607
{\an8}YOU'LL PRETEND TO FALL.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.442
{\an8}WHEN HE HELPS YOU UP,

03:12.525 --> 03:14.611
{\an8}YOU OFFER TO BUY HIM
A DRINK TO SAY THANKS.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.945
{\an8}YOU TAKE HIM TO A BAR

03:16.029 --> 03:18.573
{\an8}WHERE I'LL BE READY TO SNAP
A PICTURE.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.491
{\an8}- OOH, I HAVE
THE PERFECT COVER STORY.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.286
{\an8}I'M A DOWN-ON-MY-LUCK BALLERINA
NURSING A HIGH ANKLE SPRAIN.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.456
{\an8}- I'M GONNA STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.124
{\an8}IF A MAN WANTED TO HEAR
A WOMAN TALK,

03:28.207 --> 03:31.753
{\an8}HE'D JUST STAY HOME
WITH HIS WIFE.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.922
{\an8}YOU JUST TELL HIM
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD TIME.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.214
{\an8}AND WHATEVER HE SAYS,

03:35.298 --> 03:38.134
{\an8}YOU ANSWER WITH,
"I BET YOU ARE."

03:38.217 --> 03:40.470
- THIS IS SO EXCITING.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.097
SO WHO DO YOU USE
AS THE HONEY TRAP

03:43.181 --> 03:44.933
WHEN A HUSBAND WANTS
TO CATCH HIS WIFE CHEATING?

03:45.016 --> 03:47.477
- WELL, ME, OBVIOUSLY.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.437
I MEAN, WHY HIRE HAMBURGER

03:49.520 --> 03:51.940
WHEN YOU'VE GOT STEAK
RIGHT HERE?

03:52.023 --> 03:55.443
- AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY TRAPPED
CHEATING WIVES?

03:55.526 --> 03:57.320
- NOT A ONE.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.280
NO.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.990
ONE THING CLEVELAND
CAN BE PROUD OF

04:01.074 --> 04:04.786
IS HOW LOYAL THEIR WIVES
ARE TO THEIR HUSBANDS.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.164
- OKAY, WE'RE GOING LIVE
ON <i> GOOD MORNING AMERICA</i>

04:08.247 --> 04:10.708
IN FIVE, FOUR, THREE...

04:10.792 --> 04:14.504
- HI, I'M DR. LORI HERNANDEZ
WITH THE CLEVELAND CLINIC.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.214
I AM HERE WITH HOLLYWOOD
ACTRESS VICTORIA CHASE

04:17.298 --> 04:19.634
DISCUSSING KIDNEY DONATION.

04:19.716 --> 04:22.011
- YOU KNOW, KIDNEY DONATION
IS MUCH EASIER

04:22.095 --> 04:23.388
THAN MOST PEOPLE THINK.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.348
I URGE ALL OF YOU
TO REGISTER.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.683
YOU COULD SAVE A LIFE.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.850
- THAT'S CORRECT.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.185
RIGHT NOW,
THERE ARE HUNDREDS

04:29.269 --> 04:30.311
OF PATIENTS IN CLEVELAND
WAITING

04:30.395 --> 04:31.896
FOR SOMEONE
TO DONATE A KIDNEY,

04:31.980 --> 04:33.982
INCLUDING LISA SLOPEY,

04:34.065 --> 04:37.193
JUST TEN YEARS OLD AND
IN DESPERATE NEED OF A KIDNEY.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.320
- OH, WHAT A SWEET CHILD.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.697
YOU KNOW,
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING

04:40.780 --> 04:42.532
TO DONATE MY KIDNEY TO HER,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I--

04:42.615 --> 04:45.827
- YOU CAN.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.037
WE CAN TAKE A BLOOD SAMPLE
AND SEE IF YOU'RE A MATCH.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.872
IT'S QUICK AND SIMPLE.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.457
- NO,
I-I HATE TO CORRECT YOU

04:51.541 --> 04:53.209
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION,
DOCTOR,

04:53.293 --> 04:55.169
BUT I HAVE AN ADULT KIDNEY,

04:55.253 --> 04:57.588
AND SHE NEEDS
A LITTLE GIRL KIDNEY, SO--

04:57.672 --> 05:00.633
- A COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.678
KIDNEYS ARE EASILY TRANSFERRED
BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.888
SO SHALL WE GET YOU TESTED?

05:05.972 --> 05:10.268
- YES. ABSOLUTELY.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.437
KIDNEY DONATIONS...

05:12.520 --> 05:16.399
KNOW THE FACTS FIRST.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.071
YOU SAID DOING SOMETHING
FOR SOMEONE ELSE

05:22.155 --> 05:23.531
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.241
NOW I FEEL WORSE.

05:25.324 --> 05:27.410
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
GONNA VOLUNTEER ON AIR.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.370
- I WAS PLAYING THE PART
OF SOMEONE WHO CARES.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.164
I GOT CAUGHT UP
IN MY CHARACTER.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.458
- OKAY, HONEY, LISTEN.
I'LL TAKE THE TEST TOO.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.043
I'M A REALLY GOOD TEST TAKER.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.170
I'LL PROBABLY BE A MATCH.
- OH, PLEASE.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.005
WE BOTH KNOW IT'LL BE ME.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.757
IN THE MOVIES,
IT'S ALWAYS THE STAR,

05:40.840 --> 05:44.052
NEVER THE QUIRKY BEST FRIEND.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.307
- SO, MARK,
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.226
- I'M JUST A SINGLE GUY
WHO LIKES TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.353
- I BET YOU ARE.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.775
OH, MY GOD. SEAN.

05:58.858 --> 05:59.942
- YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

06:00.026 --> 06:02.820
- YES, HE'S MY...BROTHER.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.447
- GOOD-LOOKING FAMILY.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.909
- HE SURE IS.
I MEAN, WE ARE.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.786
OH.

06:09.869 --> 06:10.953
I JUST REMEMBERED.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.247
MOM WANTS ME TO TELL HIM
SOMETHING.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.624
- WELL, HURRY BACK.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.251
I'M EAGER TO HEAR MORE
ABOUT YOUR BALLET THINGY.

06:17.335 --> 06:21.339
- HUH?
OH, I BET YOU ARE.

06:23.007 --> 06:23.966
HI, SEAN.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.302
- JOY.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.513
WOW. IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.973
- YOU TOO.
HOW'S CHLOE?

06:31.057 --> 06:33.726
- ACTUALLY,
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WITH US.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.187
- OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.481
YOU KNOW,
AFTER I BROKE UP WITH YOU

06:38.564 --> 06:39.857
WHEN I FOUND OUT
YOU WERE A--

06:39.941 --> 06:41.484
YOU KNOW.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.486
- A BRONY?

06:43.569 --> 06:45.780
JOY, I KNOW YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS A LITTLE STRANGE.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.990
BUT I AM NOT ASHAMED TO BE
ONE OF THE MANY BROS

06:48.074 --> 06:50.868
WHO ARE INTO <i> MY LITTLE PONY:</i>
<i>FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC.</i>

06:50.952 --> 06:52.620
- AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

06:52.703 --> 06:56.833
I'M SORRY I WAS SO
SHORT-SIGHTED AND JUDGMENTAL.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.001
ELKA AND I ACTUALLY WATCHED
A COUPLE OF EPISODES

06:59.085 --> 07:00.086
OVER MARGARITAS.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.338
IT WAS FUN.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.341
WE DRANK EVERY TIME
WE SAW A RAINBOW.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.593
- I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'VE OPENED UP TO IT.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.805
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN ME
FOR DINNER?

07:10.888 --> 07:12.682
- I'D LOVE TO.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.184
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

07:15.268 --> 07:18.604
I NEED TO USE
THE LITTLE PONY'S ROOM.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.899
- JOY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

07:21.983 --> 07:24.527
- REKINDLING AN OLD FLAME.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.028
- YOU DATED HIM?

07:26.112 --> 07:28.406
WHAT IS HE,
RICH OR SOMETHING?

07:28.489 --> 07:29.699
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.075
HE'S PERFECTION.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.535
HE'S A FIREMAN--A HERO.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.704
- A CIVIL SERVANT?

07:34.787 --> 07:38.249
JOY, NO, I SEE YOU MORE
WITH A SEXY LONER

07:38.332 --> 07:39.667
WHO OWNS HIS OWN BUSINESS,

07:39.750 --> 07:43.004
A GINGER-HAIRED MAN
OF MYSTERY.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.381
- NO.
I SEE MYSELF WITH HIM.

07:45.464 --> 07:46.549
- WELL, WHATEVER.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.050
QUIT FLIRTING WITH THAT HERO

07:48.134 --> 07:51.387
AND GO MAKE OUT
WITH THAT ZERO.

07:51.470 --> 07:54.015
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.933
BUSINESS BEFORE PLEASURE.
GET YOUR CAMERA READY.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.643
- RIGHT.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.732
- LOOK,
I'M ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING

08:02.815 --> 08:04.108
THAT MIGHT SEEM A BIT WEIRD.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.904
BUT REMEMBER THAT EPISODE
OF <i> MY LITTLE PONY</i>

08:07.987 --> 08:09.530
WHERE PINKIE DUST
HAD TO PRETEND

08:09.614 --> 08:11.115
TO BE SOMEONE SHE'S NOT

08:11.199 --> 08:12.909
TO CATCH HER NEMESIS,
THUNDER TAIL,

08:12.992 --> 08:15.077
BEING A NAUGHTY PONY?

08:15.161 --> 08:17.914
- OF COURSE.
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.584
- WELL, KEEP THAT IN MIND
TILL I GET BACK.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.919
- HEY. HOW'S YOUR BROTHER?

08:23.002 --> 08:23.920
- GREAT.

08:24.003 --> 08:24.921
WANT TO MAKE OUT?

08:25.004 --> 08:25.796
- SURE.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.469
- WOW.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.096
SHOULD I GET A ROOM?
- YES.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.600
IN ONE OF THOSE DEPRESSING
PLACES FOR DIVORCED MEN.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.101
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.227
- I'M CONFUSED.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.480
- I BET YOU ARE.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.943
[cell phone rings]

08:47.026 --> 08:47.944
- IT'S THE HOSPITAL.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.111
- YOU ANSWER IT.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.697
- HELLO?

08:51.781 --> 08:54.450
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.285
WELL, THAT IS WONDERFUL NEWS.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.454
THANK YOU, DR. HERNANDEZ.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.997
IT REALLY IS GOOD NEWS.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.958
VICTORIA, WE'RE GONNA SAVE
A LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.418
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WE"?

09:04.502 --> 09:05.628
- WELL, MOSTLY YOU,
BUT I'M GONNA BE WITH YOU

09:05.711 --> 09:09.298
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.759
- EXCEPT FOR THE STEP WHERE
THEY BUST HER OPEN

09:11.842 --> 09:15.763
LIKE A PINATA
AND PULL OUT HER KIDNEY.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.683
- OH, MY GOD!
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.352
ANY SURGERY THAT DOESN'T HAVE
THE WORD "PLASTIC" BEFORE IT

09:21.435 --> 09:23.020
IS POINTLESS.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.313
I BLAME YOU, MELANIE.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.148
- I KNOW IT'S SCARY,

09:26.232 --> 09:29.277
BUT IT REALLY IS
A VERY SIMPLE OPERATION.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.696
AND--AND THE SCAR IS MUCH
SMALLER THAN IT USED TO BE.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.157
- OH, MY GOD.
I FORGOT ABOUT THE SCAR.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.659
- OH, BIG DEAL.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.828
YOU KEEP SAYING
YOU'RE WAY TOO OLD

09:38.911 --> 09:41.163
TO STILL BE WEARING
A BIKINI.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.291
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

09:44.375 --> 09:48.462
- MAYBE I SAID IT.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.548
POINT IS, IT'S BEEN SAID.

09:56.220 --> 09:56.971

10:04.562 --> 10:09.108

10:09.191 --> 10:11.360
- ACTUALLY, I PREFER TO DO
EVERYTHING IN MODERATION.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.155
- MM. EXCEPT WORK OUT, HUH?

10:14.238 --> 10:16.157
OR DO YOU TAKE STEROIDS?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.366
I MEAN, YOU DON'T GET
A BODY LIKE THAT

10:17.450 --> 10:18.659
HITTING THE GYM
ONCE A WEEK.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.537
I LEARNED THAT THE HARD WAY.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.332
HEY, WHAT'S WITH
ALL THESE NAPKINS

10:24.415 --> 10:25.750
WITH PHONE NUMBERS ON THEM?

10:25.833 --> 10:26.751
- AH, YOU KNOW HOW WOMEN ARE.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.337

I PREFER TO DATE

10:42.224 --> 10:43.434
ONE WOMAN AT A TIME.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.186
IN FACT, I'M MEETING
SOMEBODY HERE TONIGHT

10:45.269 --> 10:46.354
THAT I REALLY LIKE.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.563
- PROSTITUTE.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.649
MAKES SENSE.
NO MUSS, NO FUSS.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.277
- NO, SHE'S NOT A PROSTITUTE?
- NO?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.196
SO WHAT DO YOU DO FOR KICKS?

10:55.279 --> 10:58.115

IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.594
I HAVE FIVE EPISODES DVR'D
RIGHT NOW.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.596
- OH, WELL, SPOILER ALERT--

11:20.679 --> 11:22.765
THE ESTATE
IS BEING MISMANAGED.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.308
- NO.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.601
- I KNOW.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.437

11:34.318 --> 11:36.112
- HE'S MY BOSS.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.614
SHALL WE GET A TABLE?

11:38.697 --> 11:41.742
- YEAH, I COULD EAT.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.994
- OKAY. I'LL ASK THE HOSTESS
FOR A BIGGER TABLE.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.871
- GREAT.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.791
WOW, WHAT A CRAZY
COINCIDENCE, HUH?

11:48.874 --> 11:51.293
- THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.754
- JOY,

11:53.838 --> 11:56.090
FOR PROFESSIONAL REASONS,
YOU AND I CANNOT BE LOVERS.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.968
- OH, GOD.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.220
- BUT I STILL CARE ABOUT YOU.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.514
SO I CAME DOWN HERE
TO CHECK OUT THIS SEAN GUY,

12:03.597 --> 12:05.433
SEE IF HE'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU.

12:05.516 --> 12:09.854
AND GOOD NEWS IS
HE IS.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.690
AND IT MAY JUST BE
THE JACK TALKING,

12:12.773 --> 12:14.692
BUT HE'S PRETTY EASY
ON THE PEEPERS.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.654
- DAMN.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.156
- SEAN STILL NOT RETURNING
YOUR TEXTS?

12:20.239 --> 12:21.824
- HE AND BOB TURN
THEIR PHONES OFF

12:21.907 --> 12:23.826
WHEN THEY'RE WATCHING
<i>DOWNTON</i>

12:23.909 --> 12:26.787
OR PLAYING <i> HALF-LIFE</i>
OR GOING TO BASEBALL GAMES.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.165
THEIR BROMANCE IS
RUINING MY ROMANCE.

12:29.248 --> 12:33.669
- BROS BEFORE HOS, JOY.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.337
- ELKA!

12:35.421 --> 12:38.299
- DID I SAY IT WRONG?

12:38.382 --> 12:40.134
THEY'RE THE BROS,
SHE'S THE HO.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.927
NO, THAT'S RIGHT.

12:44.763 --> 12:45.848
- I'VE GOT A PLAN.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.850
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE'S HEARD THE STORY

12:47.933 --> 12:49.685
OF SOMEONE WHO WAKES UP
IN A HOTEL BATHTUB

FULL OF ICE
MISSING A KIDNEY, RIGHT?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.231
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.027
I NEED TO FIND
THE GUY WHO DOES THAT.

- YOU SERIOUSLY WANT TO STEAL
SOMEONE ELSE'S KIDNEY?

13:01.447 --> 13:02.698
- WELL,
IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

13:02.781 --> 13:06.368

- YES, IT'S AN OPERATION.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.289
AND YES, IT'S A BIG DEAL.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.041
BUT THERE IS A LITTLE GIRL
OUT THERE

13:12.124 --> 13:13.167
THAT IS GOING TO LIVE

13:13.250 --> 13:14.710
BECAUSE YOU DO THIS.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.545
- IF SHE DOES IT.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.424
WELL, I'M HALF AFRAID I'M GONNA
WAKE UP WITHOUT A KIDNEY.

13:22.426 --> 13:26.222

OH, I SEE.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.859
YOU'RE GOING IN
A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.528
WITH SOMEONE YOUNGER.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.446
[laughs] NO, OF COURSE
I'M DISAPPOINTED,

13:42.530 --> 13:44.532
BUT I UNDERSTAND.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.951
GOOD-BYE.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.202
- DID YOU LOSE A PART?

13:48.285 --> 13:52.331
- NOPE. I GAINED ONE.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.749
THEY FOUND A BETTER MATCH.

13:53.832 --> 13:54.917
I AM KEEPING MY KIDNEY.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.880
OH! SO MANY EMOTIONS ARE
FIGHTING EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW.

13:59.964 --> 14:04.260
HAPPINESS, EUPHORIA,
UTTER JOY.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.262
- THEN WHY DID YOU SOUND SO SAD
ON THE PHONE?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.931
- WELL, SO I'D STILL GET CREDIT
FOR WANTING TO DO IT.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.934
OH, THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN
WHEN I TOLD MY CHILDREN

14:12.017 --> 14:14.687
I'D TAKE THEM TO DISNEYLAND,
AND THEY ALL GOT CHICKEN POX.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.235
- IS THAT SEAN'S JACKET?

14:21.318 --> 14:22.278
- YEAH.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.904

14:23.988 --> 14:25.614
WHEN WE WENT TO
THE INDIANS GAME TOGETHER

14:25.698 --> 14:27.950
AND I GOT A LITTLE BIT CHILLY.

[sniffs]

14:30.327 --> 14:33.080
IT STILL SMELLS LIKE HIM.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.001
- LOOK, BOB.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.295
I REALIZE SEAN IS A NICE GUY.

- REALLY NICE.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.256

14:42.339 --> 14:44.967
- SUPER FUN.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.011
- BUT I NEED YOU TO BACK OFF,

14:47.094 --> 14:49.930
SO I CAN SPEND MORE TIME
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

14:50.014 --> 14:54.018
- SO ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO STOP SEEING HIM?

14:54.101 --> 14:55.352
- I CAN'T BELIEVE

WHY WE CAN'T HANG OUT ANYMORE.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.332
WAS IT SOMETHING I DID?

15:16.415 --> 15:19.168
- NO, IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S ME.
- BUT YOU SAID--

15:19.251 --> 15:22.004
- LOOK, WE BOTH SAID
A LOT OF THINGS.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.007

ALL REAL AND TRUE AT THE TIME.

IS GETTING A LITTLE CONFUSING.

FOR LETTING ME COME OVER.

THROUGH.

WOULDN'T DO THAT.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.231
NOT TALK ABOUT STUFF
BECAUSE I'M SICK.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.608
- I'M SORRY.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.959
- WHO CARES?
YOU'LL STILL BE MARRIED.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.420
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.297
I MEAN, WHY SHOULD I STAY HOME
AND FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF?

16:47.381 --> 16:49.091
I HAVE TO JUST BELIEVE
THAT EVERYTHING

16:49.174 --> 16:50.592
IS GOING
TO TURN OUT OKAY

FOR ME.

THEY DID SOME MORE TESTS.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.410
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT

17:16.492 --> 17:18.244
THAT OTHER KIDNEY
ISN'T GONNA WORK OUT,

17:18.328 --> 17:20.998
SO I GET TO GIVE YOU

AGAINST YOU DOING THAT.

A LITTLE CHILLY.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.225
SHE'D LIKE THAT BLANKET.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.894
- WELL, SHE CAN'T HAVE IT

19:46.977 --> 19:48.103
BECAUSE IT'S A GIFT.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.063
ELKA MADE IT FOR EMMET.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.440
- I THOUGHT
HE MIGHT LIKE SOMETHING

19:51.523 --> 19:54.610
TO CUDDLE UP WITH
TO REMIND HIM OF

ELKA,

20:15.047 --> 20:19.301
I WOULD LIKE MY INITIALS
IN MY CAPPUCCINO FOAM.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.055
AND NOT THE TWO LETTERS
YOU PUT IN THERE YESTERDAY.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.644

20:28.727 --> 20:30.979
- SHE'S ONLY GOT
THE ONE KIDNEY.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.024
IT WOULDN'T TAKE MUCH.
