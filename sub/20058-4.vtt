[Stealth Elf grunting]

00:22.500 --> 00:24.125
-Take note, students.
-[snoring]

00:24.208 --> 00:26.542
See how Stealth Elf
strikes with precision?

00:26.625 --> 00:29.042
-And her reflexes, unparalleled.
-Ha-yah! Ha-yah!

00:29.125 --> 00:30.750
[all grunting]

00:34.792 --> 00:36.917
[grunting continues]

00:44.375 --> 00:46.667
-[Pop Fizz] Ah! [chuckles]
-[gasps]

00:46.750 --> 00:49.375
Um, you guys are doing good, too.

00:52.708 --> 00:53.750
[pants]

00:54.667 --> 00:57.375
[sighs] Huh.
Thought there'd be more to it than that.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.292
Congratulations, Stealth Elf.
You've set a new record.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.500
Way to go, Elfy. [grunts]

01:02.583 --> 01:05.875
Thanks. But never let your guard down
in the middle of a training simulation, E.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.000
[grunts]

01:07.083 --> 01:08.958
-Words to live by.
-[yells]

01:09.042 --> 01:11.917
And you displayed remarkable
resourcefulness in the battlefield.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.708
That's why I'd like you to do
a "Skills, Elements, and Defense" Talk.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.958
-[gasps] Me?
-[Spyro] Whoa, a SED Talk?

01:18.042 --> 01:19.417
That's huge.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.958
Seriously, Elfy, congratulations.

01:22.042 --> 01:23.042
-[Stealth Elf gags]
-What an honor.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.917
Hmm, yes, well, typically SED Talks
come from graduates of distinction,

01:27.000 --> 01:29.125
and accomplishment,
and a certain amount of experience.

01:29.208 --> 01:32.417
Ah, I'm... I'm sure
he'll ask you someday, dude.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.250
This is just... Wow!

01:34.333 --> 01:35.917
-[snores]
-I'll do my best.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
[grunting excitedly]

01:37.083 --> 01:41.125
I have full faith that the minds
of these young, impressionable cadets

01:41.208 --> 01:43.083
-are in good hands.
-[gulps]

01:43.167 --> 01:44.458
Class dismissed!

01:44.542 --> 01:46.458
-[Dreamcatcher clears throat]
-[gasps]

01:46.542 --> 01:48.542
I'm so excited for you.

01:48.625 --> 01:49.667
Are you excited?

01:50.375 --> 01:52.667
I can't tell because your eyes
don't have pupils.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.417
It makes you very hard to read.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.000
You must be the youngest Skylander
to ever do a SED Talk.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.167
It's usually, uh, old Skylanders
with fake hips.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.042
-Or middle-aged Skylanders with fake legs.
-[clangs]

02:03.125 --> 02:05.792
Why do so many SED Talkers
have missing limbs?

02:05.875 --> 02:08.417
Probably because they were all wounded
defending the Skylands

02:08.500 --> 02:10.208
in brave, heroic battles.

02:10.292 --> 02:12.667
Is that what I'm missing?
Not missing a limb?

02:12.750 --> 02:13.875
Because I don't need my tail.

02:13.958 --> 02:16.250
Uh, pretty sure you're focusing
on the wrong part of the criteria.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.333
[Hugo screaming]

02:17.417 --> 02:18.833
[Stealth Elf] Whoa.

02:18.917 --> 02:20.917
Is it just me, or is he
screamier than usual?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Nah. Hugo's always like that.

02:23.083 --> 02:27.000
[gasping] Get away,
you blanched beast of burden.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.417
Well, his alliterations
are getting better.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.167
Morning, Elfy.
You're up early.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.250
Never slept.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.625
Of course.
You're prepping for your SED Talk...

03:09.708 --> 03:11.458
by throwing blades?

03:11.542 --> 03:13.833
Yup. Obviously.
Ha-yah!

03:13.917 --> 03:17.333
Ah, yes. Keeping your mind
as sharp as a blade.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.750
That was good.
Feel free to use that.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.500
Ah, you don't need to.
You're gonna crush it.

03:21.583 --> 03:24.708
Good thing too, because guess what we did.

03:24.792 --> 03:27.458
[both] We made flyers
and invited everyone we know.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.208
And some randos that we don't know.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.500
Probably doesn't mean as much,
but they're coming.

03:31.583 --> 03:33.208
[chuckles nervously] Wow.

03:33.292 --> 03:35.125
Uh, you guys
really didn't have to do that.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.917
Sure we did. 'Cause you're gonna
drop some knowledge bombs

03:38.000 --> 03:39.667
and everyone will be blown up by them.

03:39.750 --> 03:43.625
-This is why you're not giving a SED Talk.
-Not arguing with that.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.917
[chuckles] That was really sweet, guys.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.750
Anytime. I mean,
probably just this one time

03:48.833 --> 03:51.542
because this
is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.417
[sighs] Yup.
That's why I'm gonna be amazing.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.583
-[bleats]
-[gasps]

03:55.667 --> 03:56.958
[Spyro] Get it away from me.

03:58.042 --> 03:59.667
-Don't hide behind me.
-[bleating]

03:59.750 --> 04:02.250
I... I don't wanna be
any closer to it than you are.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.375
[chuckles] Is this a joke?

04:03.458 --> 04:04.500
-What are you guys doing?
-[both gasping]

04:04.583 --> 04:06.958
-Don't let it... Don't let it get us, Elf.
-[whispers] Please.

04:07.042 --> 04:09.750
Since when are you two so scared of sheep?

04:09.833 --> 04:11.583
Have you been hanging out
with Hugo or something?

04:11.667 --> 04:13.667
They're herding us.
They're herding us.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.125
-[bleating]
-Whoa, whoa. It's okay. I've got you guys.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.833
Elf, you don't have time for this.

04:17.916 --> 04:19.708
You have a SED Talk to prepare for.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.541
Don't get distracted.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.208
I just realized...
[yelling] Sheep are terrifying!

04:24.292 --> 04:26.167
-Get them away!
-You, too?

04:26.250 --> 04:27.958
Something's definitely up.

04:28.042 --> 04:30.417
Don't worry. I'm gonna figure out
what's happening to you.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.292
What's happening is
we've spent our whole lives

04:32.375 --> 04:34.292
being irrationally brave around sheep.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.625
Really? All of you?
Oh, boy.

04:37.708 --> 04:40.417
Don't worry about us. Work on your SED--
[screams] Sheep!

04:40.500 --> 04:42.292
[gasping] Oh! Oh, it was just a cloud.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.458
[chuckling] I thought it was a sky sheep.

04:46.917 --> 04:49.750
I know, I know.
I had tickets for the whole series.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.625
-[banging on door]
-But then the pianist comes down

04:51.708 --> 04:52.958
-with whooping cough...
-[Kaos grunting]

04:53.042 --> 04:57.250
...so they scrap the concerto,
and substitute a mime with a pan flute.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.875
-[clattering]
-[grunting]

04:58.958 --> 05:01.500
-[sighs] Gotta go, Your Eminence.
-[Kaos laughs maniacally]

05:01.583 --> 05:04.250
Now, sir, your mother left
specific instructions

05:04.333 --> 05:05.875
that you were not to leave the castle.

05:05.958 --> 05:08.292
Oh, don't you start too, Glummy.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.208
I'm still furious
about the whole job kerfuffle.

05:11.292 --> 05:15.167
First, I'm forced to caper around
in this gizzard getup to pay the bills,

05:15.250 --> 05:17.333
and now Mother forbids me
from leaving the lair?

05:17.417 --> 05:19.375
Ah, the indignity never ends, sir.

05:19.458 --> 05:20.542
I know, right?

05:20.625 --> 05:23.458
And, apparently, after my most
recent attempt to get my hands

05:23.542 --> 05:24.875
on the map to the Core of Light,

05:24.958 --> 05:28.917
she's "worried" that the Skylanders
might actually capture me.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.292
Well, she has had to move
the castle several times

05:31.375 --> 05:32.417
to avoid your getting caught.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.625
Maybe getting caught would be better.
I'm basically grounded.

05:35.708 --> 05:38.125
[chuckles] That's putting
a rather negative spin on it, sir.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.833
Although in this case...
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

05:40.917 --> 05:45.542
You know, I was only considering
forcing you to eat this, but now...

05:45.625 --> 05:49.625
Mother might not have faith in me,
but if the Skylanders are after me,

05:49.708 --> 05:52.292
-it proves that I am a legitimate threat.
-[beeps]

05:52.375 --> 05:53.417
Huh.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.583
Mmm. To a select few, yes.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.167
-[coughs]
-And I'm quite sure

05:59.250 --> 06:00.292
the moment I get the map,

06:00.375 --> 06:02.625
Mother will be singing
a very different tune.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.625
But if I'm grounded, I can't even try.

06:04.708 --> 06:07.625
Well, it's not like the Core of Light
is going anywhere.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.542
And even the most evil masterminds
need a day off now and then.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.792
For instance, there's plenty to do
here in the plotting room

06:12.875 --> 06:15.333
to pass the time
till your mother calms down again.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.583
I mean, just look at how disorganized
your villainous collectibles are.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.042
You can't leave until they're
properly arranged, can you?

06:21.125 --> 06:24.542
And I bet by the time that's done,
Kaossandra will have forgotten

06:24.625 --> 06:28.083
all about this unsavory
grounding business.

06:28.167 --> 06:31.417
[softly] If it keeps you busy
per your mother's specific orders.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.250
What? I can't hear you.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.583
I said it's like the Internet.
If you heard it, it must be true.

06:40.833 --> 06:41.875
-[bleating]
-[gasps]

06:41.958 --> 06:43.792
-Uh, no, no, no.
-[all gasping]

06:43.875 --> 06:45.458
What is going on here?

06:45.542 --> 06:47.125
Oh, she's got a sheep.

06:47.208 --> 06:50.958
Sheepophobia is pervasive.
Almost everyone's been affected.

06:51.042 --> 06:53.750
The situation is more serious
than I thought.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.792
-[bleats]
-[all screaming]

06:56.875 --> 06:58.333
[yells]

06:59.333 --> 07:01.042
What is it about sheep that terrifies you?

07:01.125 --> 07:02.583
It's their eyes.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.000
Definitely the wool.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.875
They just grow their own sweaters.
What is that?

07:06.958 --> 07:09.083
It's the fact that it's a sheep.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.625
By the way, we made signs
for your SED Talk.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.083
[chuckles] Oh. You shouldn't have--
Ahhh!

07:13.958 --> 07:15.125
Knowledge bombs.

07:15.208 --> 07:17.458
When did you first realize your fear?

07:17.542 --> 07:21.208
Yesterday. I woke up and knew
they're the scourge of the Skylands.

07:21.292 --> 07:23.125
Uh... Yesterday.
Can I go now?

07:23.208 --> 07:26.208
Their cloven hooves
are harbingers of doom.

07:26.292 --> 07:30.125
Okay. That wasn't my question,
but thank you for your time.

07:34.167 --> 07:36.375
Hey, Stealth Elf,
I thought of another SED quote.

07:36.458 --> 07:39.917
"When life gives you lemons,
you have to ask,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.583
'When did life get hands
and take up lemon farming?'"

07:42.667 --> 07:44.583
I... I'm kind of in the middle
of something, JV.

07:44.667 --> 07:45.792
Yes, I can see.

07:45.875 --> 07:48.333
You seem really preoccupied
with this whole-- [screams]

07:48.417 --> 07:49.417
Oh!

07:49.500 --> 07:52.208
Uh, sorry. I looked at a picture
and it just felt so real.

07:52.292 --> 07:56.375
See? I just know that someone
is doing this to the Skylanders.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.958
If our enemies find out
we have this random fear,

07:59.042 --> 08:00.375
they could use it to destroy us.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.333
Solving this is really important.

08:02.417 --> 08:04.417
So is giving a SED Talk.
It's a huge honor.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.208
I know! I've been to every single SED
since I was a junior cadet.

08:08.292 --> 08:09.667
Then why aren't you
thinking about it at all?

08:09.750 --> 08:10.750
I am.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.583
It's all I can think about.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.292
I haven't slept in days.

08:14.375 --> 08:17.708
Oh, you wanna know why I'm so desperate
to solve the sheep thing?

08:17.792 --> 08:20.958
Because I know I don't deserve
to be giving one of these talks!

08:22.500 --> 08:24.292
[gasps and sighs]

08:24.375 --> 08:27.250
Stealth Elf, what are you talking about?

08:27.333 --> 08:29.458
You absolutely deserve to do a SED Talk.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.833
No, I don't.

08:30.917 --> 08:34.000
I mean, think about all the Skylanders
who have done it before.

08:34.082 --> 08:36.582
Cobalt, the Brave,
Sharon, the Victorious,

08:36.667 --> 08:40.042
Edwin, the Meek At First
but Eventually Brave and Victorious.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.375
They all have these distinguished titles.

08:42.457 --> 08:45.333
-I'm just... me.
-I see.

08:45.417 --> 08:49.125
You're hoping to become
Stealth Elf, the Sheep Vanquisher.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.500
Well, something cooler than that,
but you get the idea.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.208
Well, I, for one, don't think
you need a bunch of words

08:54.292 --> 08:56.042
after your name to be cool.

08:56.125 --> 08:59.167
But only you can jump the hurdles
you've created for yourself.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.917
Oh!
Another good one.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.333
I'm just going to keep working
on these in case you need them.

09:03.417 --> 09:07.042
Thank you for... all that.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.333
Uh, could you do me one more favor?

09:08.417 --> 09:10.708
-[grunts]
-Could you not tell anyone?

09:10.792 --> 09:14.375
Of course. Just call me
Jet-Vac, the Non-Teller.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.333
Oh, no, that's a terrible name.

09:16.417 --> 09:19.792
I won't tell anyone if you promise
never to call me Jet-Vac, the Non-Teller.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.125
Deal.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.750
[Kaos] Well, Glumshanks,

09:22.833 --> 09:24.667
I'm all finished organizing my collection

09:24.750 --> 09:27.750
of villains who wish they were
as villainous as me.

09:27.833 --> 09:31.000
Now then, back to planning
the destruction of the Core of Light.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.667
My latest scheme involves
shipping containers

09:33.750 --> 09:36.958
and holding our breath
for an extended period of time.

09:37.042 --> 09:38.167
[Glumshanks chuckles] Sounds great.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.583
But are you sure you're done
organizing those, sir?

09:41.667 --> 09:42.708
What?

09:42.792 --> 09:45.042
How did Pepper Jack
get in front of the Golden Queen?

09:45.125 --> 09:47.208
I am so sorry, Golden Queenie-weenie.

09:47.292 --> 09:50.625
Did that evil chef
try to steal your spotlight?

09:50.708 --> 09:52.750
Now you know how Mother makes me feel.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.792
[clears throat] Now,
as I was saying, Glummy--

09:54.875 --> 09:56.250
I'm so sorry to interrupt, sir,

09:56.333 --> 09:58.875
and I am definitely interested
in hearing more about this fiendish plot,

09:58.958 --> 10:03.042
but, uh, have you noticed
the complete and sudden disarray

10:03.125 --> 10:04.667
-of your comic book collection?
-What, what, what?

10:04.750 --> 10:06.125
This simply will not do.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.750
My thoughts exactly.
[exhales heavily]

10:10.833 --> 10:12.125
[sighs] Day three.

10:12.208 --> 10:14.458
Sheepophobia continues to run rampant.

10:14.542 --> 10:17.458
And I think I'm the only Skylander
who hasn't been affected.

10:17.542 --> 10:19.000
What am I not seeing?

10:19.083 --> 10:22.625
It all started at the dorms.
And it happened overnight.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.000
So our villain must be a student.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.542
But how are they doing it?

10:26.625 --> 10:28.708
What do all the victims have in common?

10:28.792 --> 10:30.792
Something that they're doing
that I'm not doing.

10:30.875 --> 10:32.208
-[knocking on door]
-[Spyro] Elf?

10:32.292 --> 10:33.458
I know you're probably working,

10:33.542 --> 10:36.208
but you missed breakfast,
and dinner last night, so...

10:36.292 --> 10:37.625
-[door closes]
-It's morning already? [sighs]

10:37.708 --> 10:39.042
Guess I forgot to sleep again.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.417
[gasps] That's it.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.875
You're a genius.

10:41.958 --> 10:44.458
I know, right?
My pancakes are pretty amazing.

10:44.542 --> 10:46.917
I'll tell you what it is.
It's the smiley face.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.917
See, the trick is to do it backwards,
so when you flip it--

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
No. That can't possibly matter.
It'd be the same both ways.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.500
Right. See, that's why you're giving
the SED Talk and not me.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.292
Not really, but I can't explain right now.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.500
I gotta go to sleep.

10:57.583 --> 10:59.375
[sighs] Still a genius.

11:00.167 --> 11:02.833
-[voice recorder clicks]
-[Stealth Elf] Dreamcatcher. Age 14.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.542
Silly floating head in the real world,

11:04.625 --> 11:07.958
but incredibly powerful
in the dream realm.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.083
Get ready to face off in my dreams.

11:12.917 --> 11:15.292
[groans] Solving a case
gives me such a rush.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.375
Might take a minute. [snoring]

11:18.500 --> 11:20.333
[grunting and panting]

11:23.667 --> 11:25.542
-[gasps]
-[laughs]

11:25.625 --> 11:27.667
Hello, Stealth Elf.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.583
Yes, you're right.

11:30.667 --> 11:34.333
You are small, insignificant.

11:34.417 --> 11:37.417
You have no knowledge to impart.

11:37.500 --> 11:41.500
-You're nothing, a nobody.
-[grunts]

11:41.583 --> 11:43.458
Come out, Dreamcatcher.
I know it's you.

11:43.542 --> 11:44.625
[laughing maniacally]

11:44.708 --> 11:46.833
You're the one behind
everyone's sheepophobia.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.417
Yay for you.
You figured it out.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.708
But why?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.875
Because being good is so boring.

11:52.958 --> 11:55.625
Especially when you get to hang out
in the dream realm.

11:55.708 --> 11:58.292
You can do anything you want.

11:58.375 --> 11:59.708
[gasps]

11:59.792 --> 12:03.000
The real world's full
of lame goody two-shoes, like Eon

12:03.083 --> 12:04.542
and my parents.

12:04.625 --> 12:08.083
They thought they could reform me
by sending me to this stupid school.

12:08.167 --> 12:10.792
But sometimes you just gotta do you.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.958
-And I'm super evil.
-[grunts]

12:13.042 --> 12:15.917
Besides, watching you all
run away from sheep? Hilarious.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.875
Well, it stops now.

12:17.958 --> 12:20.917
Nah. Since you figured out it was me,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.250
I'm just gonna have to keep
you here forever.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.208
I can't have you ruining my fun.

12:25.292 --> 12:26.958
[sheep laughing maniacally]

12:31.208 --> 12:32.208
[screams]

12:33.417 --> 12:34.750
Sleep tight.

12:34.833 --> 12:35.917
[grunts]

12:36.000 --> 12:37.417
[stutters] I don't understand.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.375
[chuckles] Let me break it down for you.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.333
This is the dream realm,

12:41.417 --> 12:46.292
where I have
ultimate power over you because...

12:46.375 --> 12:48.458
you're asleep
for as long as I want you to be.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.292
[laughs]

12:50.375 --> 12:52.792
And I can do stuff like this.

12:54.042 --> 12:58.333
[laughs] Sorry, it's, like, super hard
to take you seriously with those shoes.

12:59.750 --> 13:00.750
[grunting]

13:00.833 --> 13:02.375
Uh-uh.

13:04.875 --> 13:06.458
Uh, did you seriously not hear

13:06.542 --> 13:09.708
the part about me being
the ultimate power in the dream realm?

13:09.792 --> 13:10.792
Oh, I heard you.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.917
But I have friends to save
and a SED Talk to give.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm not giving up.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.958
Goody. More fun for me.

13:17.042 --> 13:18.417
[grunting]

13:19.458 --> 13:21.250
Incoming pie!

13:21.333 --> 13:22.375
[screaming]

13:22.458 --> 13:24.708
[laughing maniacally]

13:25.917 --> 13:27.667
[indistinct chatter]

13:29.792 --> 13:31.500
I can't wait to hear Elf's SED Talk.

13:31.583 --> 13:32.958
[chuckles] I know, right?

13:33.042 --> 13:35.167
-[both] Elf! Elf! Elf!
-Elf--

13:35.250 --> 13:36.417
Wait, she's not here yet.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.667
-[sighs] Has anyone seen Elf?
-[Eruptor] Nope.

13:39.750 --> 13:43.458
But that may be because I've been
hiding out in my room, avoiding sheep.

13:43.542 --> 13:44.875
Uh, okay.

13:44.958 --> 13:49.000
I haven't seen her since she weirdly
hugged me and told me I was a genius.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.250
That was my way of letting you know

13:50.333 --> 13:52.667
that someone who's giving a SED Talk
called me a genius.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.750
Well, until she arrives,
I don't suppose any of you

13:55.833 --> 13:57.958
have something
you would like to give a talk on?

14:00.208 --> 14:04.750
Oh. Uh, I suppose I might have
a few pearls of wisdom to share.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.125
Like, um... Oh!

14:07.208 --> 14:11.875
"The road not taken is a mystery
because you didn't take that road."

14:14.250 --> 14:16.292
Uh, I mean...
[clears throat] Uh...

14:16.375 --> 14:20.208
"When life shuts the door in your face,
learn to stop putting your face in doors."

14:20.292 --> 14:21.625
[takes deep breath]

14:21.708 --> 14:22.833
Yes. Oh, dear.

14:22.917 --> 14:25.542
Uh, I can't do this.
I... Pass. Not it.

14:25.625 --> 14:26.792
-[clears throat]
-Anyone else?

14:28.208 --> 14:29.792
[chuckles] I got this.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.792
Uh...

14:37.875 --> 14:39.250
-[snoring]
-[thuds]

14:39.333 --> 14:40.542
[gasps]

14:41.292 --> 14:42.375
[thudding continues]

14:43.667 --> 14:44.792
[Kaos grunting]

14:47.292 --> 14:49.667
-[sighs]
-Oh, good, Glummy. You're awake.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.750
[grunts] I finally figured it out.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.667
It's a test. [continues grunting]

14:53.750 --> 14:55.042
Mother wants me to escape.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.500
Uh... Oh, I'm not so sure about that, sir.

14:57.583 --> 15:01.333
You see, once I'm out, I'll either be free
to destroy the Core of Light,

15:01.417 --> 15:03.333
or go to prison.
Ha-yah!

15:03.417 --> 15:06.542
Either way,
the legend of my evilocity will grow.

15:06.625 --> 15:07.625
-[Kaos] Yah!
-[sighs]

15:07.708 --> 15:11.375
-"Evilocity" isn't even a word.
-[thudding]

15:12.292 --> 15:13.333
[sniffs]

15:13.417 --> 15:16.000
Ah! All righty then, Glummy.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.500
Ready to get the Core of Light?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.125
I really think we should just stay here.

15:19.208 --> 15:22.583
I mean, the sun is starting to go down,
and it is bath night, remember?

15:22.667 --> 15:24.833
We're gonna walk on the wild side, Glummy.

15:24.917 --> 15:26.625
-[groans]
-Let's go!

15:26.708 --> 15:28.375
Sir, that is a terrible-- [grunts]

15:31.708 --> 15:32.917
[grunting]

15:34.167 --> 15:37.875
You can't just... [grunts]
mess with Skylanders in their dreams...

15:37.958 --> 15:40.750
[grunting] ...because it's fun.

15:40.833 --> 15:42.250
What are you talking about?

15:42.333 --> 15:46.125
That's, literally,
the perfect reason to do it. [laughs]

15:51.500 --> 15:52.708
[gasps]

15:53.833 --> 15:56.417
Your SED Talk was gonna stink anyway.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.625
You can't save your friends.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.000
You're nothing.

16:00.083 --> 16:01.167
[grunting] No!

16:02.042 --> 16:03.375
[Dreamcatcher laughing]

16:05.833 --> 16:07.625
[Stealth Elf grunts] You win.

16:07.708 --> 16:08.833
The sheep are right.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.333
Maybe it's a good thing
I'm missing my SED Talk.

16:11.417 --> 16:15.250
-I can't even beat you in my own dream.
-[Dreamcatcher laughing]

16:15.333 --> 16:16.375
Unless...

16:16.458 --> 16:18.792
Of course you can't beat me.

16:18.875 --> 16:21.875
In the dream realm,
I am all-powerful. I...

16:21.958 --> 16:24.333
Unless what? I'm interested
in where you're going with this.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.792
[grunting]

16:27.167 --> 16:28.833
-[both groan]
-This is my dream.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.375
Yeah. And?

16:30.458 --> 16:32.875
You can't be all-powerful in my dream.

16:32.958 --> 16:35.042
It's happening in my head.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.750
That's my property.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.042
What? How are you doing that?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.208
Yah!

16:42.833 --> 16:43.958
[groans]

16:44.042 --> 16:45.833
No way. Huh.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.792
I meant to turn those into butterflies
that matched my bow, but...

16:48.875 --> 16:50.375
[scoffs] No matter.

16:52.625 --> 16:53.917
[grunting angrily]

16:57.125 --> 16:59.750
[distorted] Pop.
No, pop!

16:59.833 --> 17:00.833
Whoa!

17:00.917 --> 17:02.042
No!

17:02.125 --> 17:04.875
I'm supposed to be all-powerful
in the dream realm.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.416
Like, seriously, how many times
do I have to say it?

17:07.500 --> 17:10.208
I guess if I believed that, you would be.

17:10.291 --> 17:13.458
-But, I don't. Wake up, Elf.
-[bleating]

17:14.583 --> 17:15.875
[gasps]

17:15.958 --> 17:17.166
Oh. [chuckles]

17:17.250 --> 17:19.416
Hey, hey, girl.
So, um...

17:19.500 --> 17:21.250
You feeling rested?

17:21.333 --> 17:23.166
No crazy dreams, I hope. [chuckles]

17:23.250 --> 17:25.500
So nice of you to come by.
[grunting]

17:25.583 --> 17:28.333
Makes it that much easier to do this.
[grunting]

17:31.542 --> 17:33.583
[groans] Oh, come on.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.500
And that's how I got the name Spyro.

17:37.583 --> 17:40.792
Oddly, I... I never heard
from Gyra again and, um...

17:42.708 --> 17:46.000
Um, right. So, uh...

17:46.083 --> 17:48.583
Well, first off, there's a lot more to me
than just my name.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.542
I can, uh, let's see...

17:51.625 --> 17:55.042
Oh, I can make music with my armpit.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.792
Check it out.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.250
[clamoring]

17:59.958 --> 18:02.167
-[indistinct chatter]
-She's here!

18:02.250 --> 18:03.625
Hi, everybody.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.333
My SED Talk is about...

18:06.417 --> 18:08.083
[snaps fingers]
"Hitting Your Mark."

18:08.167 --> 18:09.458
What is a mark, exactly?

18:09.542 --> 18:10.875
It can be anything. [snapping fingers]

18:10.958 --> 18:12.792
A target, a villain,

18:12.875 --> 18:14.458
an annoying cousin named Mark.

18:14.542 --> 18:15.542
-Ooh...
-[all laughing]

18:15.625 --> 18:17.292
I, too, have an annoying cousin
named Mark.

18:17.375 --> 18:18.417
So relatable.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.167
But for me, it was a goal.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.750
You see, when I was asked
to do this SED Talk,

18:22.833 --> 18:24.375
I didn't think I was worthy of it.

18:24.458 --> 18:27.792
I mean, what could I say
to inspire a bunch of cadets

18:27.875 --> 18:30.250
when it feels
like I just graduated yesterday?

18:30.333 --> 18:33.208
That's not true, Elfy.
You're awesome.

18:33.292 --> 18:34.542
Aw, thanks, E.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.500
But I had to believe it for myself.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.667
These blades?
Not a big deal.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.000
You know, I train with them,
I fight with them,

18:42.083 --> 18:43.667
and I've cut apples with them.

18:44.875 --> 18:45.875
[chomps]

18:46.792 --> 18:48.750
This is a metaphor.
I just know it.

18:48.833 --> 18:51.750
But just because these babies
haven't won an epic battle

18:51.833 --> 18:53.167
doesn't mean they can't.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.750
Just because they mostly hit
practice dummies

18:55.833 --> 18:58.833
doesn't mean they won't defeat
our greatest enemies someday.

18:58.917 --> 19:01.583
They don't have to do those things
to be amazing,

19:01.667 --> 19:05.125
because I already know they are amazing.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.625
You're more than one achievement.

19:06.708 --> 19:09.458
You're the sum
of everything you do, every day.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.708
And as long as you believe
you can do something,

19:11.792 --> 19:14.167
and you can go after it
with all you've got,

19:14.250 --> 19:17.500
you'll be surprised
what you're capable of. [grunts]

19:17.583 --> 19:19.625
-[all gasp]
-Whoa!

19:19.708 --> 19:24.958
And knowing you can do it is the key
to hitting your mark.

19:25.042 --> 19:27.417
-[all gasp and cheer]
-All right!

19:27.500 --> 19:29.167
-Whoo!
-That's the way you do it!

19:29.250 --> 19:31.792
-[cheering]
-[Ka-Boom] That's how it's done.

19:31.875 --> 19:32.875
[Jet-Vac] Most impressive!

19:32.958 --> 19:35.083
[Dreamcatcher] Yay.
Or whatever.

19:35.167 --> 19:37.875
Oh, also, I caught this villain,
who's been crashing your dreams

19:37.958 --> 19:39.250
to make you all scared of sheep.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.417
[all gasp]

19:40.500 --> 19:41.750
But as long as you remember

19:41.833 --> 19:45.042
you're the most powerful
in your own head, she can't get to you.

19:45.125 --> 19:48.375
-[indistinct chatter]
-Stealth Elf, you are amazing.

19:48.458 --> 19:49.625
[Jet-Vac] Most impressive.

19:49.708 --> 19:53.542
Wow. My whole life, I thought
I had a deep-seated fear of sheep,

19:53.625 --> 19:54.792
but I don't.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.458
[yells] I was wrong.

19:56.542 --> 19:59.500
Get away, you terrifying
cotton ball of calamity.

19:59.583 --> 20:00.792
-[growls]
-[whimpers]

20:01.708 --> 20:04.625
Oh, I hate to admit it,

20:04.708 --> 20:07.000
but this is the most not-boring SED Talk
I've ever been to.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.583
Oh, thank you. The sheep thing
added a really nice button.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.167
So, you know, you helped.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.458
Cool.

20:12.542 --> 20:14.833
Does this mean I can go back
to being a cadet,

20:14.917 --> 20:17.958
and we can pretend this never happened
and you don't have to tell my parents?

20:18.042 --> 20:20.000
Oh, heck no.
You're going to jail.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.417
And you're expelled,
and I'm calling your parents.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.583
[groans]

20:24.583 --> 20:25.667
Yes! Jackpot!

20:25.750 --> 20:27.000
[yelps]

20:27.083 --> 20:29.167
What an evil genius you are, sir.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.625
-Your mother couldn't help but be proud.
-[Kaos groans]

20:31.708 --> 20:33.833
Can you please just take us away already?

20:33.917 --> 20:37.250
Sure. But popping up
in a room full of Skylanders?

20:37.333 --> 20:40.208
Not that I'm complaining,
but what was the plan here, guys?

20:40.292 --> 20:43.000
Oh, believe me, there wasn't one.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.000
[Jet-Vac grunting]

20:48.083 --> 20:49.917
Well done, Stealth Elf.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.792
I'm glad that when you look in the mirror,

20:51.875 --> 20:55.500
you finally see what we've always seen
in your reflection.

20:55.583 --> 20:56.917
[Eruptor] Uh, how does that work?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.542
-[Spyro] What?
-Uh... Who's standing where?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.583
Thanks, JV.
I don't know what you're saying,

21:00.667 --> 21:02.792
-but I get what you're trying to say.
-[Dreamcatcher] Ugh!

21:02.875 --> 21:04.208
[mockingly] "I'm a Skylander.

21:04.292 --> 21:06.042
We do nice things for each other,

21:06.125 --> 21:08.167
and kiss puppies, and chase rainbows."

21:08.250 --> 21:09.250
Gross.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.667
Whatever. You don't have to be
around us anymore

21:11.750 --> 21:15.167
because you've got a one-way ticket
to Cloudcracker Prison.

21:15.250 --> 21:19.625
Fine. At least there I won't be
surrounded by boring losers.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.500
-[helicopter approaching]
-So true, prison buddy.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.792
We'll become fast friends,
and when we get out,

21:23.875 --> 21:25.417
I'll let you play
with my evil action figurines.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
[grunts]

21:26.583 --> 21:28.125
[Kaos] Even the limited-edition ones.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.208
I had to send away for them.

21:29.292 --> 21:32.292
And then you have to go
get the door-busters at the toy store.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.833
It takes forever.

21:34.833 --> 21:35.917
[Glumshanks grunts]

21:36.833 --> 21:38.167
[Stealth Elf] You three have fun.

21:38.250 --> 21:41.000
Bye, now.
Anyone else want pie?

21:41.083 --> 21:42.833
I've been craving it.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.208
