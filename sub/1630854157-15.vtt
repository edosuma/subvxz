Well, we were in our house,

18:21.008 --> 18:22.992
except the laundry machine
was in our kitchen,

18:23.085 --> 18:24.251
if you can believe it.

18:24.345 --> 18:26.329
And it wasn't like
our normal laundry machine.

18:26.422 --> 18:27.663
It was more like
our refrigerator.

18:27.756 --> 18:28.922
PETER:
Yeah, run with that.

18:29.109 --> 18:32.501
Oh, and Bonnie's brother
was there, too, for some reason,

18:32.595 --> 18:34.503
which is totally random
'cause I haven't seen him

18:34.522 --> 18:36.522
in, like, oh, my God,
seven years.

18:36.674 --> 18:38.783
But, you know, I did see
a Facebook post of him

18:38.934 --> 18:40.118
from, like, a month ago,

18:40.269 --> 18:42.102
so maybe that had something
to do with it.

18:42.196 --> 18:43.270
Let's just go.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.956
No. I want to hear
how this ends,

18:45.125 --> 18:46.365
then tell her my dream.

18:46.517 --> 18:48.851
Anyway, I was doing the wash,

18:48.870 --> 18:50.962
and smoke was coming out
the machine,

18:51.113 --> 18:53.464
but it was more like a fog
than a smoke.

Lois, the reason I've been
giving Tatum so much attention
