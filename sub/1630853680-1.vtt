to the mayor of Halloween right now.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.786

-Moved back? You used to live here?

I'd rather focus
on getting into a good school.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.474
Oh! So that's why we never met.
You're a nerd.

05:09.142 --> 05:09.976
Yeah.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.276
Oh, miss.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.488

05:25.533 --> 05:27.410

05:27.910 --> 05:29.996
Okay, you said it like it was a bad word.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.709
No, but I bet it's actually good.
Which is the annoying part,

05:34.792 --> 05:36.794
'cause it should be bad.
But I'm sure it's great.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.087
Why is it annoying?

05:38.713 --> 05:42.383
'Cause I bet you're one of those people
that's, like, good at everything.

05:43.634 --> 05:48.348
The rest of us are out here overthinking,
and you're the king of karaoke.

05:49.265 --> 05:53.436
I bet you're gonna go off
and become, like, a famous musician.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.357
Actually, it's gonna be med school for me.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.274
Hmm.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.360
Yeah, both my parents are doctors,

06:00.443 --> 06:03.154
so they kind of expect me
to follow in their footsteps.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.656
But you don't want that?

06:07.575 --> 06:09.202
I mean, my dream, honestly,

06:10.370 --> 06:12.080
would be to apply to Berklee.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.626
It's my favorite music school,
but my parents don't think it's practical.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.132
Well, then you should change their minds.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.014
Come on.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.605
There.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.944
I mean, you get into the perfect school.
And then what? What's next?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.030
And then I become a lawyer.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.659
I'm gonna fight for people
that need protecting.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.577
Something my mom and I talked about.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.163
Like the next RBG.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.417
Sounds like you got
your whole future mapped out.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.210
Yeah, I don't know.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.338
You move around as much as I do,
and you crave a little stability.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.345
My parents were
actually high school sweethearts

07:09.429 --> 07:10.430
that didn't pan out.

07:12.765 --> 07:16.269
And since the divorce,
my mom's kind of taken us all over,

07:16.352 --> 07:19.772
and usually, each stop means
falling in love with a new guy.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.817
And right now, that guy is Steve.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.069
-We don't like Steve.
-He's fine.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.781
But no, I'm just…
I give her credit for never giving up.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.825
I mean, she just…

07:32.076 --> 07:34.537
I don't know, she sounds
like a hopeless romantic.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.289
Maybe.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.918
I just don't wanna…

07:43.296 --> 07:44.922
…make the same mistakes she did.

07:48.009 --> 07:48.843
Yeah.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.930
One…

07:54.932 --> 07:56.267
two…

07:58.603 --> 07:59.437
Three!

08:03.149 --> 08:03.983
Sorry.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.038
-I think it's gonna rain.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

08:18.122 --> 08:21.542
And we're still, like,
six blocks from my house.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.377
-Yeah.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.213
All right.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.590
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.647
This is me.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.236
I'm glad to have witnessed
you live up to your party-animal name.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.153
Mmm.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.201
I'm not looking for a boyfriend.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.621
-Oh, yeah--
-I'm sorry.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.122
You didn't even ask and…

09:00.706 --> 09:03.793
I'm just afraid. We've had this night.
If we kiss, we'll wanna kiss again.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.087
Or at least I will,
and I don't wanna do this whole thing

09:06.170 --> 09:08.839
if we'll break each other's hearts
in ten months when we graduate.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.341
I'm sorry.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.845
What? Why do we have
to break each other's hearts?

09:14.929 --> 09:17.640
This whole thing,
high school, this is the prologue.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.684
It sets the stage
for the rest of our lives,

09:19.767 --> 09:23.020
and no offense, but I'm not
gonna be taking my prologue with me.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.275
Okay, you think I'm insane. Look.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.822
We… we… Okay.
We… we… we can kiss. That's fine.

09:33.322 --> 09:36.617
But I just…
I needed you to know all the facts,

09:36.701 --> 09:37.702
'cause, like, I…

09:44.709 --> 09:47.253
-So… okay, that--
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.755
-I think you need a new plan.
-My plan's pretty set.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.050
It doesn't include me, so I'd like
to make an amendment if I may.

09:53.926 --> 09:54.969
I'll allow it.

09:55.052 --> 09:58.598
Okay, how about… we kiss again?

09:58.681 --> 09:59.515
Mmm.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.559
If that kiss leads to something else,

10:01.642 --> 10:04.979
then we make it
the best year ever, you know?

10:05.062 --> 10:06.981
And then we'll just end it. It's done.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.651
-Like a breakup pact?
-I'm proposing a breakup pact.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.237
So what's gonna happen
in ten months when this is over?

10:13.321 --> 10:16.032
I'll take you on
some kind of epic date, you know?

10:16.115 --> 10:19.327
And then… and then…
and then we just go our separate ways

10:19.410 --> 10:20.703
to close out the…

10:20.786 --> 10:23.039
-Prologue. Yeah.
-Prologue. That's the one.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.458
Do we have a deal?

10:34.133 --> 10:34.967
Deal.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.012
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:38.095 --> 10:38.929
Um…

10:39.847 --> 10:43.059
Yeah, I'll just go for it.
I'd like to take you on a proper date

will be your new favorite.

-Long game, now?
-Yes, it's very long.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.795
Well, the long game's
gonna have to speed it up

13:15.878 --> 13:17.505
because time is running out.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.508
Time's kind of running out
for you too, dude.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.636
It's for the best.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.806
I'm not gonna be like my parents, Stel.
I'm not doing that.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.015
Okay.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.811
Casually pivoting,

13:31.894 --> 13:36.315
uh, I think a few people are
maybe going to South Point Beach later--

13:36.398 --> 13:40.778
-Tess is going to South Point Beach later.
-Don't make me sound like a stalker, dude.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.280
-I'm not.
-We did Spring Awakening together.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.198
We're bonded.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.575
That's one
of Broadway's horniest musicals.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.952
It was hot and heavy.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.663
Mrs. G didn't even make us
do the junior version.

13:50.746 --> 13:54.083
-We straight up got to do regular.
-I think you should message her.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.211
I think you should slide into her DMs,
but that's just me.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.170
Clare?

13:58.254 --> 13:59.505
Oh f…

13:59.588 --> 14:00.506
No.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.007
What?

14:02.591 --> 14:04.593
I just sent a crying reaction.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.303
-To… to Tess?
-To Tess.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.473
Okay, fine, you DMed her.
That's good. This is a good thing.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.600
Just say it was an accident
at the bonfire tonight.

14:11.684 --> 14:16.021
Are you gonna be next to me
while I have to suffer and do this?

14:16.105 --> 14:20.192
I'm at the mercy of Aidan tonight,
but, um, we'll see. I'll try.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.029
Speaking of, he should be here,
like, any minute now.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.741
-Okay.
-You need help.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.536
-It's okay to ask.
-I don't need help.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.454
-You do need help.
-Look, it's going.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.956
-Look at that.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.167
Something ugly's in here that's asking
to not be brought to college.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.545
-That's what's happening.
-Probably the whole bag.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.797
-But don't worry about it.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.884
All right, well, um,
call me if you need backup.

14:48.804 --> 14:52.266
You, uh… sure you're ready for this?

14:52.766 --> 14:55.477
Yeah. Yeah, no, for sure.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.981
It's obviously not gonna be
the easiest night in the world,

14:59.064 --> 15:00.274
but it's a good goodbye.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.071
-Lilies.
-Hi.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.741
-Good choice.
-It's the flower of funerals.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.658
I like it.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.375
-You ready?
-Final date.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.045
-Whoa.
-Ah, damn it.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.296
Oh, Mom.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.381
-Hey.
-Hey there.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.217
My folks are right behind me.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.427
Good to see you. Let me help.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.805
I mean, we were all ready,
minus the chaos.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.641
Let's get this up.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.226
We're gonna be lost without you.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.189
You kids break up yet?

15:40.981 --> 15:42.733
-Hi.
-How are you?

15:46.070 --> 15:48.781
-You know everyone thinks you're idiots?
-Of course.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.074
-Hi.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.993
-My favorite sister.
-Oh, my only brother.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.625
Okay, here we go.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.011
While no parent loves their teen dating,

16:11.679 --> 16:14.932
Clare did manage to find
the one thoughtful high-school boy.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.350
I did.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.186
And even though
she's letting him get away,

16:20.229 --> 16:23.607
Aidan, I loved
having you in our family this year.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.568
And, Clare Bear,

16:27.903 --> 16:30.823
God knows things
have not always been easy for us,

16:31.323 --> 16:33.117
but somehow, you have managed

16:33.200 --> 16:36.286
to grow into this brilliant,

16:36.787 --> 16:40.290
caring, and determined young woman.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.672
I'll kill you if you're late
for our- 00 a.m. departure, so…

16:46.755 --> 16:50.092
Okay, we know it'll be me
dragging you out of bed in the morning.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.176
Ooh!

16:51.260 --> 16:53.262
-Okay. Yeah, maybe.
-It's true.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.973
Okay. To Clare.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.683
-Yes.
-To Clare.

16:57.766 --> 16:58.600
Clare.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.310
Steve.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.646
I… I wanna thank you

17:04.231 --> 17:05.941
for letting me into your life.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.943
I mean, who would've thought

17:08.027 --> 17:12.656
that a year after getting kicked off
the city council, I'd be living in a house

17:13.323 --> 17:16.618
with a beautiful,
intelligent, capable woman

17:16.702 --> 17:20.039
and sending a pseudo stepdaughter
off to college.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.040
Not me.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.167
Clare, most importantly,

17:24.209 --> 17:26.462
do not get mono in college.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.172
Steve! He's not wrong.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.633
-It spreads like wildfire, guys.
-He knows what I'm talking about.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.885
Cheers.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.928
This is why
we didn't need to do the toast.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.014
-To Clare and Aidan.
-Okay.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.226
-So, Clare.
-Yes.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.395
-Poli-sci at Dartmouth.
-Mm-hmm.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.522
-That's amazing. So cool.
-I'm excited.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.441
And Aidan is pre-med.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.943
-I thought you'd do something with music.
-Oh--

17:50.027 --> 17:53.238
No, Mr. Perfect over here
is gonna follow in their footsteps.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.699
Yep. Cardiologist, like his old man.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.867
Excuse me.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.828
He's gonna be a radiologist,
just like his mama.

18:01.080 --> 18:01.955
Well…

18:03.749 --> 18:06.085
-I think we have places to be.
-Yeah.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.670
We should, uh… we should get going.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.672
It's a lot on the itinerary.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.882
Itinerary?

18:14.551 --> 18:16.095
-Bungee jumping?
-Yes.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.471
We're going to buy a dog?

18:17.554 --> 18:20.015
I've been really patient.
You need to tell me what's going on.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.768
You texted me 13 times
asking me what we were doing.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.061
It was me holding back.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.773
It is my epic date. It's my rules. Period.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.610
Technically, the whole "go to college
single" thing was my idea, so…

18:32.277 --> 18:33.445
Clare, do you trust me?

18:34.029 --> 18:35.447
Yes, I trust you.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.077
-Even though everyone thinks we're crazy.
-Oh, please.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.454
They wish that they could end
a relationship this well.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.915
We're like the anti-broken hearts club.

18:44.998 --> 18:49.586
-Poster children of modern relationships.
-The king and queen of ending things.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.380
I'm breaking up with you
because I love you.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.344
Easy breezy.

I thought you said this was sold out.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.736
Summersets is like a big deal.
How did you manage to pull this off?

19:14.820 --> 19:18.448
-I, uh… have my ways.
-Okay.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.659
This takes me back to our first date.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.578
One, two. One.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.164
Check. Check.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.206
-One.
-Aidan.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.543
Colette, thank you so much
for hooking us up.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.421
I can't believe you hooked him up
after he bailed on your band.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.423
-How dare he bail on us?
-Whoa.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.092
I'm still mad at him
for not applying to Berklee.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.094
I am too. I told him.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.471
But he just had to go pre-med.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.766
-The golden boy has lives to save.
-Okay, I'm standing here.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.518
-Yeah, we know.
-Yeah, we see you.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.817
Have a good breakup or whatever this is.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.569
Thank you.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.323
Hey, we're Milk & Bone.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.825
It's a first for us
to do a breakup shout-out,

20:01.909 --> 20:04.369

21:42.301 --> 21:44.636
So… you were right.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.973
This is, like,
a lot harder than I thought.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.309
Wait, take a breath.
What's going on?

21:50.809 --> 21:55.564
Just… what if I'm throwing away, like,
the best thing that ever happened to me?

21:56.064 --> 22:01.028
But maybe I'm… I'm also just clinging
to that, 'cause Aidan's safe and easy.

22:01.111 --> 22:05.157
But also it, like, wouldn't be easy at all
if we were long-distance.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.076
Also, we're supposed to go off
and be our own people

22:08.160 --> 22:10.203
and have our own experiences and…

22:11.872 --> 22:15.000
That was the point of this whole pact
in the first place. Yep.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.878
Know what? I'm being
really stupid right now. I'm sorry.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.839
-How we doing?
-Great. Clare'll be out any second.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.050
I wanted to make sure we're still good.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.801
Yeah, we're all set, man.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.137
This can't be the end.

22:27.637 --> 22:28.722
We're making the right call.

22:28.805 --> 22:31.266
Aidan knows it. I know it.
We're gonna have our last date,

22:31.350 --> 22:33.769
and it's gonna be incredible,
and then that's it.

22:34.770 --> 22:38.607
I feel like we can make it, and hopefully,
by the end of the night, she'll…

22:39.441 --> 22:40.525
she'll feel that too.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.538
Thank you…

22:55.540 --> 22:56.458
for everything.

23:02.422 --> 23:05.300
You don't want to be
the douchey guitar guy in your dorm.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.677
Bring, like, a keyboard or something.

23:07.761 --> 23:11.598
You think my dad is gonna let me haul
a whole-ass keyboard to school?

23:11.681 --> 23:13.850
I mean, he's not the grandma from Coco.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.269
I don't know. Music's allowed at college.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.562
I don't know, you say that,

23:17.646 --> 23:20.232
but he's downloaded
an eight-part cardiology lecture

23:20.315 --> 23:21.149
for the trip.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.776
-Rough.
-I'm dead serious.

23:23.652 --> 23:27.114
Well, at least your parents can road trip
without killing each other.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.616
Once, mine fought so bad
that, I kid you not,

23:29.699 --> 23:31.535
my mom made us stop
on the Golden Gate Bridge

23:31.618 --> 23:33.120
so she could get out and walk.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.955
No. No, no, no.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.249
Hockey?

23:38.375 --> 23:39.793
What gave it away?

23:39.876 --> 23:42.462
-I've no idea.
-Like the hockey rink?

23:42.546 --> 23:44.047
Wait, okay, what are we doing?

23:45.173 --> 23:46.883
What're we doing?
Tell me what we're doing.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.969
-You got an hour.
-Thanks, Rhoda.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.720
Thanks, Rhoda.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.056
Who's Rhoda?

23:56.059 --> 23:56.935
Oh m…

23:59.396 --> 24:01.481
-The whole place?
-Oh, all of it.

24:03.567 --> 24:07.028
-You're impressed, right?
-I… I… I'm speechless.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.739
Just take it all in.
No, just take it all in.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.534
Everything that the light touches

24:13.326 --> 24:15.829
is all ours for the next hour.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.081
Whoo!

24:23.086 --> 24:24.045
-Okay.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.465
Tonight, we are reliving our firsts.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.801
All right?
We've already gone on our first date,

24:30.385 --> 24:33.180
and now we return
to our first hockey game.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.725
Okay, but that hockey game
was our first fight.

24:36.808 --> 24:41.188
I don't know why we need to memorialize
our first fight on our last date.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.482
A first fight is momentous.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.983
It's a moment of growth.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.695
That is such bull.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.409
I don't know why
you just can't admit you farted.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.578
I don't know why you're bringing this up.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.079
Aidan and Clare?

24:58.163 --> 24:59.289
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.833
This way.
The race's about to start in one minute.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.252
You guys look good. Ba-boom!

25:05.045 --> 25:07.339
Aidan, you can't say that you farted.

25:07.422 --> 25:11.301
I announce it. Like, "Yo, I let one rip."
It's funnier if you do it like that.

25:11.384 --> 25:14.304
You don't have to be perfect all the time.
Not with me.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.806
Please turn your attention to center ice

25:16.890 --> 25:19.851
for the intermission race around the rink.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.230
We've got the hot dog and the popcorn.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.565
We've got the mustard and the ketchup.

25:25.649 --> 25:29.319
"Sorry, I let one rip. My fault."
It's not a big deal. Admit the truth.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.988
I didn't fart. I don't know
what else you want me to say.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.575
I was in the car with you.
Okay, so is it disgusting if I fart?

25:35.659 --> 25:38.036
You can fart if you wanna fart.
Everybody farts.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.956
I'll hold it in.
Whenever I'm around you, I'll never fart.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.958
You have my word. Oops, I just farted.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.709
-Let me just move.
-Three!

25:44.793 --> 25:46.795
-But that's what you're acting like.
-Two!

25:46.878 --> 25:49.005
-One!
-Team Hot Dog, baby! Team Hot Dog!

25:49.089 --> 25:49.965
Go!

25:50.757 --> 25:53.093
-You can't admit it.
-Can we just focus on the race?

25:53.176 --> 25:54.886
You were so excited two minutes ago.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.680
-I'm over it.
-It's for Ellie's Deli.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.306
I'm over it. I gotta go.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.850
Are you actually leaving
'cause you think I let one rip?

26:00.934 --> 26:03.812
I'm leaving because
you don't trust me enough to admit it.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.693
I do think we owe it to ourselves
to finally win not only one

26:10.318 --> 26:11.611
but two pastries…

26:11.695 --> 26:12.612
Oh my God.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.322
…from Ellie's Deli. What're you… No, no.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.824
Are you… Excuse me?

26:15.907 --> 26:19.661
Oh, no, no. You gotta win these bad boys.
We gotta right this wrong.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.037
What are…

26:24.833 --> 26:26.042
What are you doing?

26:30.130 --> 26:30.964
Okay.

26:32.048 --> 26:32.882
It's on.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.261
Booyah!

26:36.344 --> 26:38.430
-No, no, no, no, no.
-One, two, three.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.849
Ready? We'll play nice and fair.

26:40.932 --> 26:44.686
-You won't play fair.
-I'm a fair… I'm a fair player.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.232
You ready? Three, two, one, go.

I farted on the way to the game.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.630
That might be the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.384
Hour's up, lovebirds.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.177
Let's go!

27:59.719 --> 28:02.847
-I wanna watch Shark Tank.
-Thanks, Rhoda.

28:03.765 --> 28:04.683
Thank you.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.852
This has all been so perfect.

28:18.321 --> 28:20.323
Whoo!

28:22.325 --> 28:25.120
First time you kept
outdoing yourself on a date?

28:37.298 --> 28:39.259
Oh, first time we went waterskiing?

28:39.342 --> 28:42.429
No, think, um… think more sentimental.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.723
More meaningful to us as a couple.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.350
-If I can find it.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.435
Here it is.

28:49.477 --> 28:50.979
Maybe this'll jog your memory.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.649
The first time you ever
proposed to me on a boat.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.234
-Oh, you wish.
-Aw.

28:56.317 --> 28:57.944
No, open that.

28:58.528 --> 28:59.446
Thank you.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.745
It's a rocket.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.038
Flip it over.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.381
Easy breezy.

29:18.965 --> 29:21.092
Hey! Slow down, Scotty!

29:21.176 --> 29:23.136
No, I wanna get off! No, no, no!

29:30.894 --> 29:31.728
Yes!

29:33.480 --> 29:35.190
It's good. I got you.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.942
-Easy breezy.
-Easy breezy?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.027
Easy breezy.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.905
Easy bre… easy breezy.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.244
Here we go!

29:48.328 --> 29:49.746
Yeah!

29:52.415 --> 29:54.125
Let's go! In three…

29:54.209 --> 29:55.335
Scotty!

29:55.418 --> 29:57.128
-…two…

29:57.212 --> 30:00.340
-Here we go!

30:00.423 --> 30:01.257
Scotty!

30:08.223 --> 30:10.058
Clare! Scotty, pull around.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.852
Where the hell did she go?

30:13.728 --> 30:14.604
Clare!

30:16.439 --> 30:18.107
-Clare!
-I'm over here.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.526
Clare, Clare, you're good.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.152
That's what I like to see.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.571
Okay, okay, I got you.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.531
Aidan.

30:25.740 --> 30:26.574
I got you.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.911
I got you. I got you.

30:30.703 --> 30:31.830
Come here.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.541
Yes!

30:35.124 --> 30:37.502
Yes! Yes!

30:37.585 --> 30:38.419
Hey.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.423
-Oh my God

30:43.883 --> 30:45.009
I love you.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.845
That was not easy.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.059
What did you say?

30:53.726 --> 30:54.602
I love you.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.605
Easy breezy.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.150
Okay.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.988
You got rocketed!

31:05.071 --> 31:07.574
-You got rocketed, Clare!

31:07.657 --> 31:09.367
-Let's go.
-Whoo!

31:19.627 --> 31:21.212
The first "I love you."

31:23.256 --> 31:25.258
This was definitely worth the trip.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.763
Clare, um…

31:32.098 --> 31:34.350
I know we made a deal.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.476
We don't…

31:42.817 --> 31:45.904
I wanted to know what it was like
to be launched into the air.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.740
-I mean, you were flying.
-Stop. Enough.

31:48.823 --> 31:52.076
-It was crazy though, right?
-I mean, it was crazy.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.202
I made that work.

31:55.371 --> 31:56.289
-You hungry?
-Yeah.

31:56.372 --> 31:58.082
-Pizza? All right, let's go.
-Mm-hmm.

just chill here. Wait for me.

32:34.452 --> 32:35.411
Will do.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.877
You need to be
shutting this down, immediately.

You can put me facedown all you want,

33:30.049 --> 33:32.802
-Okay, well, I just texted Stella--

33:32.885 --> 33:35.263

No, no, no, no, no. One is enough.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.438
-Hi.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.817
He'll hold you back from becoming
the woman you were meant to be.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.236
Or… or he'll be
your biggest supporter along the way.

33:50.319 --> 33:52.155
-Doubtful.
-Guys, I have a plan.

33:52.238 --> 33:54.532
And I'm gonna…
I'm gonna stick to that plan.

33:54.615 --> 33:57.994
You can't fault someone for loving
big, romantic gestures. It's kinda cute.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.997
You can't fault someone
for wanting to do their own thing.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.249
You wanna move forward
from your true love?

34:03.332 --> 34:05.626
-We are too young to know.
-Okay.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.712
Thank you, but this is more than enough.

34:07.795 --> 34:10.673
I'm getting a little anxious right now,
so let's stop.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.426
-Don't wanna mess this up.
-No, look at me.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.887
You give an inch,
and you can lose your whole future.

34:15.970 --> 34:18.639
-You wanna move away…
-We need to stay strong.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.059
I'm trying to. Wow.

34:21.142 --> 34:22.477
It's okay. I'm here.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.397
Okay, and so is James Bond.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.109
You called Stella?

34:30.193 --> 34:31.778
You're wearing a tux?

34:32.945 --> 34:34.155
We never got a prom.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.532
It's our next stop.

34:38.117 --> 34:40.661
Stella. What's up?

34:43.289 --> 34:45.708
-It's a… it's a big energy shift.
-Yeah.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.461
-I told you guys it was good.
-I like it.

34:48.544 --> 34:50.296
Come on.

34:51.672 --> 34:52.673
That's adorable.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.218
-This is a production.
-Planning the night for a while.

34:55.301 --> 34:58.179
-You stud.
-I'm gonna miss this.

34:58.262 --> 35:01.891
-Miss what?
-Us just, I don't know, all hanging out.

35:01.974 --> 35:02.892
I mean…

35:03.476 --> 35:06.104
-Not to be sappy or anything, but--
-Uh-huh.

35:06.187 --> 35:09.941
Okay, stop. I never thought
I'd have a group of friends like this.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.360
'Cause you did
nothing but school.

35:12.443 --> 35:13.861
-Ow-wah!

35:13.945 --> 35:16.948
No. Well, like, a little bit.
But because I, like…

35:17.031 --> 35:18.407
I moved around so much.

35:18.908 --> 35:23.496
And, I don't know, it's our last night
before we all go off to our new lives.

35:23.996 --> 35:28.417
Aidan and I are celebrating our firsts,
but how often do you know that

35:29.627 --> 35:32.130
this is, like, the last time of something?

35:33.297 --> 35:34.215
Damn.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.137
For real. I got suspended
before I even got to tag the senior wall.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.013
Never got to leave my mark.

35:41.597 --> 35:44.767
I'm pretty sure you did that
when you streaked at the soccer game.

35:44.851 --> 35:48.437
Well… well, yeah. I mean,
you know I like to show my school spirit.

35:48.521 --> 35:51.524
Everybody saw your ding-dong, my guy.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.986
-Aight, uh, this has been a blast.
-But I'm saying…

35:55.069 --> 35:56.529
-Okay.
-This has been a blast.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.114
You guys are awesome. I love you both.

35:58.197 --> 36:00.199
-But Clare and I--
-We should go tag it.

36:01.117 --> 36:01.951
What?

36:04.370 --> 36:07.582
I think you should tag the wall.
We have time, right, Aid?

36:08.499 --> 36:10.960
Yeah, I mean,
it's kind of a full night planned.

36:11.043 --> 36:14.630
I know, I know, but it's our last night
as a group together too.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.757
And Scotty, Scotty needs to make his mark.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.217
Absolutely.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.970
We can't leave him hanging like that.
We can't let him be forgotten.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.347
No, we don't want him to be forgotten.

36:23.431 --> 36:26.934
-Don't you have to work tonight?
-Dude, I got off like an hour ago.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.229
Aidan, it's just one stop,
and we get back to our night.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.522
For Scotty.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.732
Break into the school?

36:32.815 --> 36:34.650
And also there's…

36:35.651 --> 36:36.861
My…

36:37.987 --> 36:40.072
-Your character shoes.
-Character shoes.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.741
-Your what?
-Character shoes.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.659
-In your locker.
-In my locker.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.703
Let's go. Let's go tag the wall.

36:45.786 --> 36:46.746
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

36:46.829 --> 36:49.457
Let's go tag that wall
and save Stella's character.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.666
-Yes.
-Close enough.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.668
This is gonna be really fun.
Am I crazy?

36:52.752 --> 36:54.128
-Aidan? Dude?
-Come on.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.254
Let's go.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.464
Aidan.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.342
-It's gonna be fun.
-Come on.

36:59.425 --> 37:00.885
-Please?
-Come on.

37:00.968 --> 37:01.969
Come on.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.640
-I mean, I guess it is our only--
-Come on! Wow!

37:05.723 --> 37:07.350
-Let's go.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.560
-Yeah.
-Okay, okay, okay.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.604
-To the school.
-Party bus!

Yo!

38:40.443 --> 38:42.194
So there's no plan at all?

38:43.446 --> 38:44.613
Here we go.

38:48.868 --> 38:49.869
That's all I got.

38:49.952 --> 38:52.121
Okay, follow me. Follow me.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.289
I know what to do.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.375
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Be quiet, man.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.670
-Trying to get us in trouble.
-I know people who've done this before.

38:59.754 --> 39:02.882
-You're breaking and entering.
-I'm not breaking and entering.

39:02.965 --> 39:06.260
So technically, this is the only door
in the school that doesn't fully lock.

39:06.344 --> 39:10.014
I know 'cause of fire safety checks.
Whatever. Watch this. You go like…

39:11.015 --> 39:14.393
What the… Okay, Clare,
you legit just made me a feminist.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.604
-Well-done.
-A lot better than my attempt.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.189
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

39:18.272 --> 39:21.359
-Student Council paid off. Maybe not.
-Football. Aidan, go long.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.736
-Nope, took too long.
-I don't like this.

39:23.819 --> 39:27.073
-Scotty, why? Why would you do that?
-Okay.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.533
Okay, you and me,
we're gonna go to the art room

39:29.617 --> 39:32.119
and get our paint for the hands.
You guys, character shoes?

39:32.203 --> 39:33.204
-Meet back here?
-Yeah.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.997
-Let's go. Ready?
-Wait, what?

39:35.081 --> 39:37.249
-Oh. Okay.
-Scotty, we're out, okay?

39:37.333 --> 39:39.794
-Pick up your feet, guys. Let's go.
-All right. All right. Okay.

39:39.877 --> 39:40.753
Okay.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.511
Nothing like the theater, I tell ya.

39:49.845 --> 39:54.308
Well, okay,
time to find my character shoes.

39:54.392 --> 39:57.853
-Which are in my locker.
-Stella, you can drop the act.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.108
Yeah, we cleared these out in May,

40:02.191 --> 40:05.152
and honestly, I've never owned
a pair of character shoes.

40:05.236 --> 40:10.074
I mostly work on set stuff,
but you knew that.

40:13.119 --> 40:16.163
You know, we should be recreating
our prom night right now.

40:20.167 --> 40:23.087
You know,
when Clare got sick before the prom,

40:24.713 --> 40:27.174
she was actually relieved
she didn't have to go.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.468
Stella, you know good and well

40:29.552 --> 40:31.762
that she would've had a great time
if we would've gone.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.723
I actually don't think I know that.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.601
You can't control
everything, Aidan.

40:37.685 --> 40:41.397
You can't…
"Aidan" your way out of situations.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.815
Aidan my way out of situ…

40:42.898 --> 40:45.067
-What in the world… Please tell me what--
-You know what…

40:45.151 --> 40:46.610
I think you know what I mean.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.071
I have no clue. You used my name
as a verb. What does it mean?

40:50.865 --> 40:53.993
Positively, when one,

40:54.076 --> 40:57.788
an Aidan for example,
behaves in a sort of manner

40:57.872 --> 41:01.625
where, you know, you sort of…

41:01.709 --> 41:04.378
You know?
And then things kind of go your way.

41:05.713 --> 41:06.714
I'm just saying,

41:07.548 --> 41:10.593
you both set the rules at the start.

41:10.676 --> 41:13.053
You can't be upset
if she doesn't wanna break them.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.763
There's no way we could've known

41:14.847 --> 41:16.891
it would've turned out
to be as good as it is though.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.100
It's good.

41:18.184 --> 41:21.020
Yes, you guys are my favorite couple.
I'm obsessed with you.

41:21.103 --> 41:22.521
So you think I should keep trying?

41:24.523 --> 41:27.568
You just need to be honest with her.

41:28.152 --> 41:32.615
Just… be real with each other.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.702
And then when you're done with that…

41:39.288 --> 41:41.707
hope for the best, my light-skinned king.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.172
Thank you. Yeah.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.089
Okay.

41:50.090 --> 41:51.425
I feel like mixing black…

41:51.509 --> 41:54.178
-Wow, that's a lot.
-Just gotta get the right color.

41:54.261 --> 41:55.930
You did just mix black paint--

41:58.432 --> 42:00.935
Now, can you check
that there's blue, please?

42:01.018 --> 42:02.645
Or purple, for that matter?

42:04.522 --> 42:05.356
Thank you.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.150
You need to hurry up
because they're waiting.

42:08.734 --> 42:11.278
What's the rush? I thought you'd be happy

42:11.362 --> 42:13.781
about avoiding your relationship
a little longer.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.576
-No, I… wasn't.
-I'm messing.

42:18.577 --> 42:19.912
Sort of. Kind of.

42:21.705 --> 42:22.540
Not really.

42:28.003 --> 42:29.213
This isn't working.

42:30.589 --> 42:31.590
I know.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.301
I just wish Aidan would see that too.

42:35.344 --> 42:37.346
I was talking about the paints.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.058
Right, the paints.

42:41.141 --> 42:44.228
Do you wanna just go
with a… a solid color?

42:44.979 --> 42:46.230
Not whatever that is.

42:47.439 --> 42:48.691
Let's… let's go with red.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.408
Dude, tonight just wasn't the clean break
I was hoping it would be.

42:57.491 --> 42:59.910
Please, Clare,
it was always gonna be messy.

42:59.994 --> 43:01.120
And you know it.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.914
I don't know, maybe if Aidan were
more excited about school,

43:03.998 --> 43:07.293
or if he ended up
deciding to, you know, like--

43:07.376 --> 43:08.544
Go to Berklee?

43:10.254 --> 43:11.088
Yeah.

43:12.089 --> 43:13.173
I've heard that.

43:13.716 --> 43:17.136
You know, he's just so talented,
and I know his parents think

43:17.219 --> 43:20.306
it's a huge risk or whatever
to pursue that, but I don't know.

43:20.389 --> 43:23.934
I don't know if it would end up actually
being that much of a risk with him.

43:27.229 --> 43:28.063
Well,

43:29.481 --> 43:32.401
I don't think Aidan thinks
it'd be much of a risk with you.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.544
Oh, there she is.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.297
In the flesh.

43:56.550 --> 43:57.635
My Everest.

43:59.511 --> 44:01.221
What color you going with?

44:01.847 --> 44:03.974
Red. The color of war.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.353
Disturbing.

44:08.729 --> 44:13.067
-Scotty! Scotty!
-Oh, yeah.

44:13.150 --> 44:15.361
Ready for the Senior Week suspension.

44:15.444 --> 44:17.446
Scotty! Scotty!

44:17.529 --> 44:18.530
Scotty!

44:18.614 --> 44:19.573
Ooh!

44:19.657 --> 44:22.034
-Scotty!
-Yo!

44:22.701 --> 44:25.287
-Okay, a bold choice.

44:25.371 --> 44:28.582
-But we'll take it though.
-There's so much paint and no towel.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.584
-Okay, well--
-Well, thank you.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.462
What you gonna do?
Wipe it on my jacket? Who raised you?

44:33.545 --> 44:35.297
-Go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

44:35.381 --> 44:38.008
-Why would I voluntarily…
-I don't know.

44:38.092 --> 44:41.136
-That is barely a handprint.
-Yeah.

44:45.474 --> 44:48.060
How many couple prints
you think actually last?

44:51.939 --> 44:52.815
I don't know.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.736
Jade and Marcus already broke up.

44:59.446 --> 45:03.242
Stella said she hooked up with some guy
at MSU before school even started.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.120
Wow.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.414
Didn't even last a month.

45:09.289 --> 45:11.667
-Is that what you're afraid of?

45:18.924 --> 45:20.384
I don't know, Aidan. I just…

45:22.344 --> 45:25.180
I wanna give ourselves
the chance to be our own people.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.975
Don't you just wanna be able
to jump into any situation

45:28.058 --> 45:31.019
and not have to give it
a second thought, you know?

45:31.103 --> 45:32.813
I want that, and I want that for you too.

45:32.896 --> 45:36.066
It's one of those things
I've always had in the back of my mind.

45:36.150 --> 45:40.362
And I'm sorry if that sounds selfish,
but that's always been my plan--

45:40.446 --> 45:43.657
For two seconds, forget…
forget about your plan.

45:44.533 --> 45:46.785
Okay? What… what do you want?

45:54.626 --> 45:55.461
Aidan…

46:00.424 --> 46:02.009
I may have triggered the alarm.

46:02.092 --> 46:04.928
He definitely did.
It's the one that's ringing right now.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.181
It really doesn't matter.
Just run.

46:07.264 --> 46:11.018
-♪ I feel, feel like a cokehead ♪

46:11.101 --> 46:14.605
-♪ I feel, feel like I can't get drunk… ♪
-Go, go, go, go, go.

46:15.522 --> 46:18.108

46:18.192 --> 46:20.527

46:24.448 --> 46:26.116

-Go, go, go, go!

46:26.700 --> 46:29.119
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

46:31.246 --> 46:33.415
Think someone's
actually chasing us?

46:34.875 --> 46:35.876
To safety.

46:37.294 --> 46:38.504
Here. I got you.

46:45.552 --> 46:47.137
-Come on.
-Dude, hurry.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.389
Come on!

46:53.477 --> 46:55.687
-Oh shit.
-Oh my God, are…

46:55.771 --> 46:57.523
Oh my God. Are you okay?

46:57.606 --> 46:59.858
-I'm good. Yeah.
-You're okay? Okay.

46:59.942 --> 47:00.776
Oh God.

47:00.859 --> 47:02.444
Oh no.

47:02.528 --> 47:03.403
No.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.113
Stella, no, no, no.

47:05.197 --> 47:07.157
-Stella, no.
-Should I call the driver?

47:11.495 --> 47:13.580
-You feel okay? Okay.
-I'm good.

47:15.457 --> 47:18.168
-Just one more stitch here.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.784
How's our patient doing?

47:51.285 --> 47:53.704
I'm all right, Mom.
I already told you, I'm good.

47:53.787 --> 47:56.373
Well, you're lucky it's me on call
and not your dad.

47:57.499 --> 48:00.377
You know, Dr. Olsen,
my son is gonna be pre-med this fall.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.462
-Is he now?
-Mm-hmm.

48:02.546 --> 48:06.967
He'll be just a short drive from Clare.
She's off to Dartmouth in the morning.

48:07.467 --> 48:08.886
Bright and early.

48:12.431 --> 48:13.390
Oh.

48:13.473 --> 48:14.600
-That was good.
-Yeah.

48:16.685 --> 48:18.520
Ooh!

48:18.604 --> 48:20.856
-Come on. Yeah.
-I mean, you know?

48:20.939 --> 48:24.484
What's your plan? Like, after school…

48:24.568 --> 48:26.570
-I got a houseboat.
-You got a houseboat?

48:26.653 --> 48:29.281
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have a houseboat.
That's my plan.

48:29.364 --> 48:30.574
-Okay.
-What about you?

48:30.657 --> 48:33.035
-You're going to college, right?
-Yeah.

48:33.118 --> 48:35.996
-Is that--

48:36.079 --> 48:38.081
-Meeting new people.
-That is what it is.

48:38.165 --> 48:39.791
That stuff takes time, you know?

48:39.875 --> 48:44.296
It takes people actually, like, being, uh,

48:45.005 --> 48:46.590
interested in you, maybe?

48:46.673 --> 48:48.050
I was interested in you.

48:48.133 --> 48:51.887
-Sorry.
-I had a really big crush on you.

48:51.970 --> 48:53.847
-Yeah, in seventh grade.
-Huh.

48:53.931 --> 48:56.850
On the bus back from Lansing.
I brought mints on it,

48:57.434 --> 48:59.186
'cause I was gonna make out with you.

48:59.269 --> 49:00.979
The mints are a nice touch.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.940
If there's one thing I know,

49:03.523 --> 49:05.233
you gotta be bold.

49:06.109 --> 49:08.445
Be bold.

49:09.738 --> 49:11.782
Tell me more about what women want.

49:11.865 --> 49:13.992
I'm telling you,
it's gonna get you places.

49:14.076 --> 49:15.243
Like a houseboat?

49:16.286 --> 49:19.873
-So, your last stop is a bonfire?

49:20.582 --> 49:21.458
Sort of.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.545
It… The beach was supposed to be
just the two of us,

49:25.629 --> 49:27.881
but the night's taken a few turns.

49:27.965 --> 49:31.885
Ah. Well, if I were a better parent,
I'd make you both go home right now.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.887
Oh, thank God you're so terrible then.

49:33.971 --> 49:34.846
Ah.

49:34.930 --> 49:35.931
We'll be okay.

49:36.431 --> 49:38.016
-Mmm.
-He's alive.

49:38.100 --> 49:41.103
Ooh, let's see those stitches. Mmm.

49:43.563 --> 49:45.649
This is gonna be the last time I see you.

49:46.733 --> 49:49.236
-Clare, you're gonna do great things.
-Thank you.

49:49.736 --> 49:52.823
And if you ever change your mind,
he won't be too far away.

49:53.573 --> 49:56.952
When he didn't get into Berklee,
he was at least excited about that.

49:59.287 --> 50:01.081
Oh, sorry, I… I thought

50:01.164 --> 50:03.917
that, um, he wasn't allowed
to apply to music school.

50:04.001 --> 50:06.003
Oh, honey, no. Uh…

50:07.337 --> 50:08.338
He didn't get in.

50:11.299 --> 50:12.843
Aidan didn't tell you.

50:15.012 --> 50:15.929
Um…

50:16.596 --> 50:18.140
No, he didn't.

50:19.975 --> 50:22.102
-But it was good to see you.

50:23.729 --> 50:24.604

51:16.031 --> 51:18.075
Uh, we're gonna meet you guys over here.

51:18.158 --> 51:20.911
We patched him up really good, though.
Really good.

51:25.332 --> 51:27.501
Dude, I'm sorry
I dragged you into all this.

51:28.001 --> 51:29.544
It's a lot.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.755
Yeah,
sort of like my whole night.

51:31.838 --> 51:33.673
But I am willing to excuse it

51:33.757 --> 51:36.802
on the grounds of you being
in the midst of the most

51:37.803 --> 51:41.014
complicated breakup of maybe all time.

51:42.307 --> 51:43.266
You didn't lie.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.149
But thank you.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.026
Like, for real.

51:57.155 --> 52:00.617
You know, this is, like,
our last night together too.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.202
I know.

52:06.414 --> 52:07.457
Mmm.

52:09.626 --> 52:13.338
Aidan is not the only one
who can do a big gesture, okay?

52:13.421 --> 52:14.256
Okay.

52:14.339 --> 52:18.969
-I… I've been planning for months, and I--
-Don't joke about that.

52:19.052 --> 52:21.638
I present you this pine cone…

52:22.222 --> 52:23.056
Oh.

52:23.140 --> 52:24.474
…which represents…

52:24.558 --> 52:25.433
Mmm.

52:25.517 --> 52:27.853
…how I felt when… when you moved.

52:29.312 --> 52:31.148
All sappy inside.

52:31.231 --> 52:32.149
Sappy.

52:32.232 --> 52:33.275
I give you this.

52:35.777 --> 52:37.946
-Cheers, bitch.
-Cheers.

52:38.029 --> 52:41.449
And may this pine cone
burn like our friendship.

52:43.493 --> 52:46.204
-I don't know, I can be sentimental.
-Is that sentimental?

52:46.288 --> 52:48.081
-Yeah.
-You put a hex on me.

52:48.165 --> 52:50.750
-That's not a hex.
-That's a bad omen.

52:50.834 --> 52:53.670
I'm saying, like,
our friendship is like heat. It's like…

52:53.753 --> 52:56.006
Okay, for sure.

52:56.089 --> 52:59.342
No, I got there. I got there.
No, but you know what's heat though?

52:59.926 --> 53:01.303
This seaweed.

53:01.386 --> 53:03.096
-Oh no, it's a sock.
-That's nasty.

53:04.514 --> 53:05.640
Oh!

53:07.350 --> 53:08.518
It's a sock.

53:09.728 --> 53:11.354
Did you just throw a sock at me?

53:11.438 --> 53:12.314
Mmm.

53:12.814 --> 53:15.942
Tess. Uh, that was… that was an accident.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.028
We were, like, doing, like, a bit thing.

53:18.862 --> 53:21.907
Uh, 'cause here I thought
the sock and the crying emoji

53:21.990 --> 53:24.159
were you acting out
'cause summer's ending.

53:24.910 --> 53:28.079
Uh, yeah, no, for sure. Yeah.

53:28.163 --> 53:30.749
Some people have love languages.
I have a grief language,

53:30.832 --> 53:34.794
where I throw debris
and send random emojis.

53:34.878 --> 53:39.382
Yeah, a few of us are heading up the beach
to Ladarian's house, if you wanna come?

53:39.466 --> 53:41.676
-We kind of like--
-That would be so cool.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.678
-We'd love to come.
-Cool.

53:43.762 --> 53:47.265
-Uh, yes, that is cool with me.
-I'll meet you guys in a sec.

53:48.808 --> 53:51.061
-Hey. Do you--
-Yeah, let's--

53:51.144 --> 53:51.978
Yeah.

53:53.939 --> 53:57.317
For the record, um, the beach was all part
of the date night anyway.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.069
We're just hitting it kinda late.

53:59.152 --> 54:03.573
Uh, yes. I assumed you wanted us
to relive the senior swim out to Rusty.

54:04.282 --> 54:06.076
Yeah, had to happen at some point.

54:06.159 --> 54:10.455
I mean, you kind of bailed
on the whole graduation race thing.

54:10.538 --> 54:13.625
-Yeah, well, the water was freezing and--

54:13.708 --> 54:17.045
I… I just don't understand the tradition
of swimming out to a buoy.

54:17.128 --> 54:19.047
I know, it's stupid.

54:19.130 --> 54:20.048
No, it's…

54:20.131 --> 54:22.592
But Rusty is still bobbing out there,

54:23.093 --> 54:24.761
and it's waiting for us.

54:29.182 --> 54:31.559
Aidan, your mom told me about Berklee.

54:33.103 --> 54:37.065
-Whoa. What?
-Why would you have kept that from me?

54:38.692 --> 54:41.987
Clare, I'm… It's not…
There was nothing to talk about.

54:42.737 --> 54:45.490
-Not a big deal.
-All I've ever been is honest with you.

54:45.573 --> 54:46.783
Clare, it… it… it…

54:50.203 --> 54:52.622
I don't… I don't know
what you want me to say.

54:54.624 --> 54:57.002
I just thought tonight
was about saying goodbye.

54:58.378 --> 55:00.297
Or is that just another lie too?

55:12.851 --> 55:14.060
It's dare.

55:15.061 --> 55:16.104

59:21.349 --> 59:24.727

without bringing it back
to the beginning, right? So that said, um,

59:59.929 --> 1:00:02.599
I would love to invite Clare to come over.

1:00:03.558 --> 1:00:05.101

I don't know what the hell
that was back there.

1:01:36.401 --> 1:01:40.697
Oh, it's just… it's me

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:43.366
I'm sorry that you put
an impossible expectation on the night.

1:01:43.449 --> 1:01:45.660
-That's not my fault.
-Impossible expectation?

1:01:45.743 --> 1:01:48.454
Clare, we… we made a ridiculous joke pact,

1:01:48.538 --> 1:01:51.040
and you somehow
turned it into a binding agreement.

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:54.836
It wasn't a joke. I know you think it was,
but I was very serious

1:01:54.919 --> 1:01:57.672
when I said I wasn't going
to college in a relationship.

1:01:57.755 --> 1:02:01.634
That was before we fell for each other.
That's… Sometimes things change.

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:05.054
Eventually, the prologue
turns into the book, Clare.

1:02:05.138 --> 1:02:06.764
Right, because we're the ones who make it.

1:02:06.848 --> 1:02:08.975
We're gonna feel the same way
for the rest of our lives.

1:02:09.058 --> 1:02:10.685
We're not gonna hurt each other.

1:02:10.768 --> 1:02:13.938
It's already starting.
We can't do this the rest of our lives.

1:02:14.021 --> 1:02:16.482
Oh my God,
you should be studied for your ability

1:02:16.566 --> 1:02:18.568
to see the worst possible outcome.

1:02:18.651 --> 1:02:20.361
Aidan, but that's… Aidan!

1:02:21.112 --> 1:02:23.865
That's not the worst possible outcome.
That's the most realistic one.

1:02:23.948 --> 1:02:26.576
I'm sorry you can't be real,
but I kept it real with you,

1:02:26.659 --> 1:02:28.494
and you couldn't even tell me
about Berklee.

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:31.330
What do you want me
to say about Berklee?

1:02:31.414 --> 1:02:34.876
My parents finally let me apply,
I went to the audition and bombed it?

1:02:34.959 --> 1:02:37.837
It was the most humiliating thing
I've ever experienced?

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:40.465
-There. There you go. There's Berklee.
-Oh my God.

1:02:42.133 --> 1:02:44.719
Oh my God, Aidan, it's… it's the fart.

1:02:45.219 --> 1:02:47.847
-It's always the fart.
-What are you talking about?

1:02:47.930 --> 1:02:51.225
You have this impossible expectation
to be perfect all the time.

1:02:51.309 --> 1:02:52.685
It's bleeding into everything.

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:54.771
-I'm not trying to be perfect.
-Yes, you are.

1:02:54.854 --> 1:02:58.524
Berklee's not the only program.
There's hundreds of other programs.

1:02:58.608 --> 1:03:02.028
You know what? Maybe if you told me
and let me in, I could've helped.

1:03:02.111 --> 1:03:04.322
-But it's too late.
-No, no, you're right.

1:03:04.405 --> 1:03:07.575
You're right. Is there a world
where I wish I could say screw it

1:03:07.658 --> 1:03:10.578
and go to LA or New York
and try to make it work

1:03:10.661 --> 1:03:13.164
and most likely fail doing so? Yeah, 100%.

1:03:13.247 --> 1:03:15.374
And you say I'm unrealistic

1:03:15.458 --> 1:03:19.212
when I'm going to school close to you
so we could try to make this work.

1:03:19.295 --> 1:03:21.964
Don't use that as an excuse.
It's not why you're going to that school.

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:25.927
It's not an excuse when you believe in us.
It's not an excuse when I love you.

1:03:26.010 --> 1:03:29.847
And maybe you would feel the same way
if… if… if you could actually say it.

1:03:33.518 --> 1:03:37.021
-What are you talking about?
-Easy breezy. "I love you." "Easy breezy."

1:03:37.104 --> 1:03:40.525
Do you have any idea how much it sucks
to tell someone you love them,

1:03:40.608 --> 1:03:43.444
and their response is "easy breezy."
What does it even mean?

1:03:45.029 --> 1:03:47.281
-You know exactly what it means.
-Just say it.

1:03:55.873 --> 1:03:56.749
Just say it.

1:04:03.631 --> 1:04:04.465
Yeah.

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:08.928
So we're… we're done.

1:04:11.931 --> 1:04:12.765
Okay.

1:04:42.003 --> 1:04:44.505
-Come on.

1:04:54.557 --> 1:04:55.558
Honey.

1:05:01.314 --> 1:05:03.691
I feel like I can't breathe or something.

1:05:06.444 --> 1:05:08.863
My heart's like beating out of my chest.

1:05:11.198 --> 1:05:12.700
Okay, okay.

1:05:22.251 --> 1:05:26.464
I know that you wanted it
to be painless between you and Aidan,

1:05:28.299 --> 1:05:30.551
but that's… that's not how it works.

1:05:31.260 --> 1:05:32.553
Not when it's real.

1:05:38.351 --> 1:05:40.394
I just thought I was so careful.

1:05:44.523 --> 1:05:45.566
You and Dad…

1:05:48.069 --> 1:05:50.154
you know, you committed so young and…

1:05:50.738 --> 1:05:52.406
and fought until you broke.

1:05:52.490 --> 1:05:54.909
I just… I didn't wanna do that.

1:05:57.995 --> 1:05:59.705
You were so unhappy, Mom.

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:05.294
Well, I'm no expert at love,

1:06:06.337 --> 1:06:07.713
no need to tell you that,

1:06:08.798 --> 1:06:13.427
but there is one thing that I do know.

1:06:14.345 --> 1:06:15.513
And that's

1:06:16.097 --> 1:06:18.474
a relationship doesn't have a shot in hell

1:06:18.557 --> 1:06:21.560
if you start planning its end
before it even starts.

1:06:25.815 --> 1:06:27.650
I just don't wanna lose myself.

1:06:28.567 --> 1:06:31.362

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:52.670
I was afraid.

1:08:57.383 --> 1:09:00.761
I was afraid of falling for you

1:09:00.845 --> 1:09:05.391
because I was worried that if I did,
I wouldn't be able to be on my own again.

1:09:06.934 --> 1:09:08.686
I don't know.
I've moved around my whole life,

1:09:08.769 --> 1:09:11.397
and I've always been
just so focused on the future

1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:13.482
and picturing what that was like.

1:09:13.566 --> 1:09:17.695
I never put much energy into the now.

1:09:20.781 --> 1:09:22.199
Then I met you…

1:09:24.493 --> 1:09:26.579
…and I… I had the best time of my life.

1:09:29.832 --> 1:09:31.667
But I was terrified. I…

1:09:32.626 --> 1:09:35.212
You messed with my plan.

1:09:38.257 --> 1:09:43.888
So here I am in the middle of the night
on a beach giving you this speech,

1:09:43.971 --> 1:09:46.724
because I'm not afraid of that anymore.

1:09:46.807 --> 1:09:50.019
And I wanna swim out to that buoy,
and I wanna finish this night,

1:09:50.102 --> 1:09:53.022
and I wanna have our last first,
because I love you so much.
