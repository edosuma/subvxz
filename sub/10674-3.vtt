WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:01.288
Previously on Underground...

00:01.585 --> 00:03.085
Tell me what I think
they are... map to freedom.

00:03.137 --> 00:06.505
It's a song, and the map
may be hidden in the words.

00:06.557 --> 00:10.345
The biggest weapon that
the Underground has is secrecy.

00:10.564 --> 00:11.563
In the eyes of the law,

00:11.598 --> 00:12.931
we are the criminals.

00:12.983 --> 00:15.671
I don't want James out in the field.

00:15.673 --> 00:17.519
He'll be wherever you want him.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.689
Once we get north,

00:19.725 --> 00:21.772
we're gonna need some
freedom papers to stay free.

00:21.807 --> 00:24.039
Papers ain't gonna matter
without the massa's seal.

00:24.064 --> 00:25.981
You gonna stop testing me.

00:26.017 --> 00:27.480
Momma, is there more?

00:27.482 --> 00:29.249
Run with me.

00:32.570 --> 00:35.655
Sunday is the day of reflection.

00:35.657 --> 00:39.826
It's a day the Lord has given us
to set aside our toil.

00:39.828 --> 00:41.494
To think on who we are

00:41.546 --> 00:43.830
and what's God's plan for all of us.

00:43.832 --> 00:46.800
Been that way since the
very first words of the Bible.

00:46.835 --> 00:48.752
What's Sam got you making?

00:48.804 --> 00:51.004
He said he'd get us across that bridge.

00:51.039 --> 00:52.339
God said,

00:52.341 --> 00:53.807
"Let there be light."

00:53.842 --> 00:55.258
So there was light.

00:55.310 --> 00:58.345
Then he separated the light
from the darkness,

00:58.347 --> 01:01.514
calling the light "day"
and the darkness "night."

01:01.516 --> 01:05.047
And then the Lord, he said,
"Let there be a canopy

01:05.099 --> 01:07.020
between bodies of water."

01:07.022 --> 01:09.689
And he called it "the sky."

01:09.741 --> 01:10.471
Come on, now!

01:10.496 --> 01:12.660
 "Let the waters
beneath the sky come together

01:12.694 --> 01:15.328
into one area,
and let dry ground appear."

01:15.364 --> 01:18.782
Now, then Lord,
he fashioned two great lights,

01:18.834 --> 01:22.168
the larger one to shine during the day.

01:22.204 --> 01:25.372
And he called the light
in the day "the Sun."

01:25.407 --> 01:27.207
And he called that light in the night,

01:27.242 --> 01:28.508
he called it "the Moon."

01:28.543 --> 01:30.239
- Yeah!
- When we gonna run?

01:30.241 --> 01:31.511
And them smaller lights
up in the night sky...

01:31.546 --> 01:34.381
Don't know.
We got to find the right moment.

01:34.433 --> 01:37.384
Then he asked the land and the water

01:37.436 --> 01:40.437
to swarm with fish and birds.

01:40.472 --> 01:42.022
He asked upon them to be fruitful.

01:42.057 --> 01:43.556
Then it was the sixth day,

01:43.608 --> 01:45.392
and the Lord said,

01:45.427 --> 01:48.395
"I will make mankind..."

01:48.397 --> 01:52.532
"...in my image to be
the master of the Earth itself."

01:52.567 --> 01:54.234
Now, on the seventh day,

01:54.269 --> 01:56.236
God had completed the work.

01:57.406 --> 01:59.105
The Lord stopped working.

01:59.141 --> 02:00.123
He rested.

02:00.158 --> 02:02.492
I-I said... he rested.

02:02.544 --> 02:05.245
Hey. Saturday, last thing, what happens?

02:05.297 --> 02:07.247
Final head count before quarters.

02:07.249 --> 02:08.798
And when's the next one?

02:08.834 --> 02:10.883
Uh, at lineup, Monday morning.

02:12.054 --> 02:14.804
That makes Sunday the Lord's gift to us.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.639
Oh, yeah.

02:16.675 --> 02:17.924
We go Saturday night.

02:17.976 --> 02:20.226
Yeah, get a head start
before anyone notice we gone.

02:20.262 --> 02:22.929
Oh, in six days,
while everyone else is resting,

02:22.981 --> 02:24.764
we gonna be running.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074

03:17.119 --> 03:18.701
Now, when Massa Tom first came here,

03:18.737 --> 03:21.404
he was pulling in twice
the cotton of old man Macon.

03:21.456 --> 03:22.822
That old bridge was crumbling,

03:22.874 --> 03:24.991
falling down under weight
of the new haul.

03:24.993 --> 03:27.377
Now, this new bridge needed
to hold 5,000 pounds.

03:27.412 --> 03:29.412
Which means the support beams

03:29.464 --> 03:31.692
needed to be stronger
and closer together.

03:31.727 --> 03:33.416
What any of that got to do with us

03:33.468 --> 03:34.968
getting across that bridge
without the rollers seeing us?

03:35.003 --> 03:39.055
Well, we built that new bridge

03:39.090 --> 03:41.508
the exact same time
we built this here shop.

03:41.510 --> 03:44.344
Which means that them beams up there,

03:44.346 --> 03:46.896
they're the exact same length
and distance from each other

03:46.932 --> 03:49.399
as the ones underneath this
there bridge.

03:49.434 --> 03:52.268
So what you're saying is we
figure a way across these beams,

03:52.320 --> 03:53.691
we can get underneath that bridge.

03:53.743 --> 03:55.688
Mm-hmm. And them rollers...

03:55.740 --> 03:58.024
standing right on top of us
if they have to.

03:59.077 --> 04:01.244
And we'll use this here harness

04:01.279 --> 04:02.885
and them there hooks.

04:02.920 --> 04:07.917
And we'll each go across one at a time.

04:09.704 --> 04:11.871
Uh, this gonna be tricky

04:11.873 --> 04:14.040
getting them hooks
underneath that bridge, though.

04:19.380 --> 04:22.048
Hooks won't matter we can't get
the harness to hold.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.550
Well, maybe we try overlaying it.

04:23.552 --> 04:25.073
Like a rope. Reinforce it.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.687
No, it ain't gonna hold you,
let alone Zeke.

04:27.722 --> 04:28.773
We need something stronger.

04:28.808 --> 04:30.557
Well, you gots to figure it quick

04:30.559 --> 04:31.858
if we leaving in six days.

04:31.893 --> 04:33.600
Might be you overestimating your plan.

04:33.635 --> 04:36.729
My plan works long as everybody
do what they 'posed to.

04:36.781 --> 04:38.398
- How them papers coming?
- They finished.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.566
Looking real nice.

04:39.618 --> 04:41.415
But that ain't gonna mean nothing

04:41.467 --> 04:42.818
without the massa's seal.

04:43.822 --> 04:45.405
Only way I see it,

04:45.407 --> 04:47.123
we got to steal it,
stamp our papers quick

04:47.158 --> 04:48.875
and get it back
before he notice it's gone.

04:48.910 --> 04:50.410
This the big house we talking about.

04:50.462 --> 04:52.212
Massa's own office.

04:52.247 --> 04:54.747
Yeah, you get caught there,
ain't gonna be no lashes.

04:54.799 --> 04:56.594
You gonna be swinging from a tree.

04:57.135 --> 04:58.635
You right.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.588
This got to be a crime of opportunity.

05:01.590 --> 05:03.726
And, uh, which one of us
has that kind of opportunity?

05:08.430 --> 05:11.314
If you believe the rumor... and I do...

05:11.349 --> 05:14.517
that Mr. Cato had his way
with the old mistress.

05:14.569 --> 05:16.436
And she was clashing her faith.

05:20.825 --> 05:22.242
Sarah, stop all that gossiping now

05:22.277 --> 05:23.660
and watch out for them frog eyes.

05:23.695 --> 05:25.245
I don't want none of my 'lasses burnt.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.362
I was just telling Corra

05:26.414 --> 05:27.864
Miss Shaw gonna want
30 pieces this time,

05:27.916 --> 05:30.166
and at two cent apiece
since she getting so much.

05:30.201 --> 05:31.251
I said I'd ask you.

05:31.286 --> 05:32.835
You already know the answer.

05:32.871 --> 05:35.455
It's three cent
apiece for the white folk.

05:35.457 --> 05:38.041
Always. No exceptions.

05:39.261 --> 05:41.794
Lord knows they can afford it.

05:41.796 --> 05:43.096
Sam, what's wrong?

05:43.131 --> 05:44.464
Ain't nothing wrong, Momma.

05:44.516 --> 05:47.216
Can't I just say hi to my kin
on my day of rest?

05:47.269 --> 05:49.769
Long as you keep your hands
out of my 'lasses.

05:49.804 --> 05:52.138
Oh, here, here. Uh, let-let me help you.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.474
Let me help you.

06:01.449 --> 06:03.199
Is it true?

06:03.234 --> 06:05.652
You running with us?

06:05.654 --> 06:07.320
Noah ask, but...

06:07.372 --> 06:09.372
I ain't made up my mind yet.

06:09.407 --> 06:10.623
Your momma know?

06:10.659 --> 06:11.708
No.

06:11.743 --> 06:13.209
You better not tell her nothing.

06:13.244 --> 06:15.044
I ain't.

06:16.131 --> 06:17.380
You don't want me to go.

06:17.415 --> 06:18.998
You ain't cut out
for something like this.

06:19.050 --> 06:21.050
You ain't gonna do nothing but
slow us down, get us caught.

06:21.086 --> 06:22.969
And if a catcher get
a hold of a girl like you,

06:23.004 --> 06:24.355
he just gonna...

06:25.056 --> 06:27.006
he gonna eat you up.

06:28.810 --> 06:30.003
I ain't scared.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.016
Fine.

06:37.018 --> 06:39.352
You get a chance
to prove that you ain't.

06:39.354 --> 06:42.689
Noah want you to steal the massa's seal.

06:48.863 --> 06:50.067
You've been quiet.

06:51.027 --> 06:53.833
I was unprepared for that... for Kyle.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.541
Bitsy.

07:01.543 --> 07:03.209
I thought that was you.

07:05.430 --> 07:06.429
Where you two coming from?

07:06.464 --> 07:08.348
Uh, John's brother's, down South.

07:08.383 --> 07:10.466
By way of Pittsburgh.

07:10.518 --> 07:11.934
Of course, we were getting off

07:11.970 --> 07:13.052
a southbound train.

07:13.054 --> 07:14.470
Oh, he didn't think anything of it.

07:14.522 --> 07:16.356
- You can't be sure of that.
- I certainly can.

07:16.391 --> 07:18.558
One doesn't just forget an engagement.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.309
How long has it been now?

07:20.362 --> 07:22.231
I-I-I'm not really sure.

07:22.283 --> 07:23.748
You're wearing your hair
like you used to

07:23.783 --> 07:24.998
when we were kids.

07:25.033 --> 07:26.627
With Mr. Still...

07:27.619 --> 07:29.068
... everything happened so fast.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.788
I never gave any thought
as to how our new roles

07:31.823 --> 07:33.956
would affect our everyday lives.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.410
Not until Kyle dropped
those slave bills.

07:37.412 --> 07:39.912
- Let me help you with your bag.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

07:39.964 --> 07:42.749
Oh, I'm sorry. No...

07:42.801 --> 07:44.500
I wasn't aware it was

07:44.552 --> 07:46.969
the constable's duty
to recover escaped slaves now.

07:47.005 --> 07:48.921
It's not. A, um, recent promotion

07:48.973 --> 07:50.473
has me wearing a marshal's star.

07:50.508 --> 07:54.093
I suppose we're gonna
have to wear two faces now.

07:54.145 --> 07:55.762
One for our new duties,

07:55.764 --> 07:58.097
the other for our public lives.

07:58.149 --> 08:01.434
And what if we lose ourselves
in all the lying?

08:02.570 --> 08:04.687
Well, congratulations are in order.

08:04.739 --> 08:06.447
And I hate to cut it short,

08:06.472 --> 08:08.074
but we're a little worn from the travel.

08:09.327 --> 08:11.444
Hope to see you again soon, Kyle.

08:13.248 --> 08:14.447
You'll see me tonight.

08:14.449 --> 08:16.449
I've been invited
to the governor's ball.

08:16.451 --> 08:18.835
A perk of the new job.

08:18.870 --> 08:20.920
Don't you two go every year?

08:20.955 --> 08:22.004
We do. Yeah.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.956
And we will definitely see you there.

08:49.317 --> 08:51.734
Zeke's the key
to getting across that river.

08:51.786 --> 08:54.821
Me and him will sneak out
to the bridge every night.

08:54.856 --> 08:56.489
Get two hooks in at a time.

08:56.491 --> 08:58.541
All right? That'll get us
across ten beams by Friday.

08:58.576 --> 09:00.460
Now, we need to get
that harness strong enough

09:00.495 --> 09:02.578
to get everyone across
by Saturday night.

09:02.630 --> 09:04.464
Why don't we just cut
up the whole saddle

09:04.499 --> 09:06.549
instead of taking a piece
off of each? Be faster.

09:06.584 --> 09:08.301
Somebody will notice a saddle missing.

09:08.336 --> 09:10.386
We got to be patient, invisible.

09:10.421 --> 09:12.138
For six more days, anyhow.

09:12.173 --> 09:14.474
Well, can I come with you
to test out the new harness?

09:14.509 --> 09:16.175
No, you ain't got no business
in the shop on a Sunday.

09:16.227 --> 09:17.176
Be too suspicious.

09:17.228 --> 09:18.728
I can help if you let me.

09:18.763 --> 09:19.979
Hey. You want to help?

09:20.014 --> 09:21.514
You think on that song.

09:21.516 --> 09:23.983
It's the most important part
of our plan.

09:24.018 --> 09:25.651
Gourds and wolves and the devil's grin.

09:25.687 --> 09:27.019
Can't make no sense of it.

09:27.021 --> 09:28.237
Hey, you got an advantage

09:28.273 --> 09:29.522
over all of us.

09:29.524 --> 09:31.691
All right? You hear a lot
in these stables

09:31.693 --> 09:33.910
about the travels of white folks.

09:33.945 --> 09:36.529
Maybe something
you remember could be key.

09:36.531 --> 09:39.365
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.083
All right.

09:41.119 --> 09:42.702
Zeke!

09:42.704 --> 09:45.204
Where's Zeke?

09:47.041 --> 09:48.674
Zeke! Zeke!

09:48.710 --> 09:51.594
It's your...

09:51.629 --> 09:55.348
It's your wife, Seraphina.

09:57.218 --> 09:59.838
Zeke, they's taking her.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.105
The slave traders, they taking her.

10:04.442 --> 10:06.559
They-they taking...

10:08.229 --> 10:12.064
It's a nasty bit of business
on the Lord's day.

10:12.066 --> 10:15.568
But I cannot have a child killer
on my plantation.

10:23.411 --> 10:26.495
Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

10:26.548 --> 10:28.247
I shall fear no evil,

10:28.249 --> 10:30.249
for thou art with me,

10:30.301 --> 10:31.634
for thy rod

10:31.669 --> 10:34.754
and thy staff comfort me.

10:49.771 --> 10:51.771
You're mine, boy!

10:56.911 --> 10:58.578
Settle down. Settle down.

10:58.613 --> 10:59.946
You gonna...

10:59.948 --> 11:01.831
Settle down. You gonna
get yourself killed.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.592
Our property was destroyed by yours,

11:18.644 --> 11:20.510
and my boss is strict
about these things.

11:20.562 --> 11:23.096
Which is why your cargo is
on one of my wagons as we speak.

11:23.098 --> 11:24.314
We'll repair your wheel

11:24.349 --> 11:25.849
while you go about
your business of the day.

11:25.901 --> 11:27.984
And when you come by on
the way back tonight,

11:28.020 --> 11:30.904
we swap wagons, it'll be like
this never happened.

11:30.939 --> 11:32.272
Well, there is another
issue, I'm afraid.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.191
This, uh, Seraphina,

11:34.243 --> 11:37.194
she appears to be more broken
than you described.

11:37.246 --> 11:39.362
I may not be able to take
her in that condition.

11:40.582 --> 11:42.782
Tell you what.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.751
I'll cut the price on her as well.

11:44.786 --> 11:46.119
How's that sound?

11:50.292 --> 11:52.008
I don't know.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.461
I really should talk
to my boss about that.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.129
What do you think of that whiskey?

11:57.382 --> 11:59.299
Oh, that's some of the
best I've ever had.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.301
Secret's in the branch water.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.688
The Macon stretch of the Yellow
River is the best, bar none.

12:09.394 --> 12:12.479
Consider both the whiskey
and the water yours,

12:12.531 --> 12:14.731
for your own trouble.

12:14.783 --> 12:17.651
Your boss need not know about it.

12:17.653 --> 12:21.021
Everyone gets what they want.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.212
One of our own out there being sold off,

12:29.248 --> 12:31.882
you in here starching your shirts.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.000
Preening like a peacock.

12:34.002 --> 12:36.002
I ain't care much for that girl anyway.

12:36.004 --> 12:38.505
She was lazy even before
she kilt that baby.

12:38.557 --> 12:39.923
You need to get Zeke out the box.

12:39.975 --> 12:41.258
Why don't you do it yourself?

12:41.310 --> 12:43.810
Oh, I would if I could,
but you the one got Bill's ear.

12:43.845 --> 12:45.929
And that's because I don't go
sticking my neck out for nobody.

12:45.981 --> 12:48.098
You think I like coming down
here, asking you for anything?

12:48.150 --> 12:49.099
We need him.

12:49.151 --> 12:50.183
He part of the group.

12:50.235 --> 12:51.735
From what I see, your group ain't made

12:51.770 --> 12:53.236
of nothing but bitches.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.072
And that's before you let women
and little girls run with us.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.941
I guarantee each and every one of them

12:57.993 --> 12:59.910
gonna fold under the slightest pressure.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.861
Zeke nearly broke
a wagon and Bill's nose

13:01.914 --> 13:03.947
for a wife he ain't even talking to.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.532
Didn't fold for nothing.

13:05.584 --> 13:08.535
That kind of strength,
that kind of loyalty.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.204
We out there on the road
facing God knows what,

13:11.256 --> 13:13.790
you rather have Zeke
by your side or not?

13:17.045 --> 13:19.258
You want him free,

13:20.349 --> 13:22.799
I think it's about time
you teach me that song.

13:28.523 --> 13:31.141
Who are they?

13:31.193 --> 13:33.276
I have no idea.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.498
Mr. and Mrs. Hawkes.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.483
We're here to begin
construction on your nursery.

13:40.535 --> 13:41.818
Construction?

13:41.870 --> 13:43.236
Believe there's been a mistake.

13:43.288 --> 13:44.904
A friend of a friend sent us.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.072
- Oh.
- Oh.

13:46.124 --> 13:47.240
- Yes, of course.
- Sorry.

13:47.292 --> 13:48.575
We weren't expecting you so soon. Sorry.

13:48.627 --> 13:49.576
My name's Clyde.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.577
The man with the lumber is Theo.

13:50.629 --> 13:51.578
And this is...

13:51.580 --> 13:53.330
Hollander. You know each other?

13:53.382 --> 13:54.631
He's a bailiff at the courthouse.

13:54.666 --> 13:56.132
I never would have guessed.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.584
As is the design.

13:57.636 --> 13:59.586
Pardon the ambush,
but we have a pressing need

13:59.638 --> 14:01.004
for the help y'all have offered.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.675
Can I have some now?

14:05.727 --> 14:08.261
After dinner.

14:08.263 --> 14:09.980
Oh, please, we just want one piece.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.431
I said you got to wait.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.099
Now, I hear any more of that whining,

14:13.101 --> 14:15.101
I'm-a sick Patty Cannon on you.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.821
Y'all better run.

14:17.856 --> 14:21.300
Y'all got the
plantation smelling so sweet,

14:21.335 --> 14:23.410
we thought we'd see if we could help.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.861
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

14:24.913 --> 14:28.531
Boo, keep those boys in line, okay?

14:28.583 --> 14:30.867
I got the papers whenever you're ready.

14:38.618 --> 14:40.133
There goes the massa.

14:42.597 --> 14:45.098
As long as the mistress
playing, you safe.

16:13.805 --> 16:16.272
Can't turn no house girl
into no field slave.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.857
Shoot.

16:18.171 --> 16:20.665
She ain't been tested like
the rest of us... she's soft.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.836
Sam, you talking to yourself?

16:22.889 --> 16:26.093
Oh, no, no, no, massa,
I was... I was just...

16:26.145 --> 16:27.344
Uh...

16:27.397 --> 16:29.013
This, uh... I was just, uh...

16:29.065 --> 16:30.264
Oh, there's no need to be embarrassed.

16:30.316 --> 16:31.515
I do it myself sometimes.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.684
Some say it's a sign of a strong mind.

16:33.736 --> 16:35.653
How's the slaver's wheel coming along?

16:35.688 --> 16:37.321
Uh, almost all put together now, sir.

16:37.356 --> 16:39.523
Just go to, uh, finish
curling the felloes.

16:39.525 --> 16:41.025
I'll get right to it.

16:41.027 --> 16:43.027
Come get you at the big house
when it's finished.

16:43.079 --> 16:44.278
How about I give you a hand?

16:44.330 --> 16:45.579
Oh, no, massa, don't-don't...

16:45.615 --> 16:47.331
Don't-don't go troubling yourself.

16:47.366 --> 16:48.666
Ain't no trouble at all.

16:48.701 --> 16:50.451
Pass me a hammer.

16:59.915 --> 17:01.248
A-All right, here, sir.

17:01.283 --> 17:03.750
Uh, hammer there now quick,
quick before it lose its shape.

17:05.871 --> 17:07.537
You know, this shop is
one of my favorite spots

17:07.539 --> 17:08.839
in the entire plantation.

17:08.874 --> 17:11.040
Would you believe me if I told
you I was jealous of you?

17:11.093 --> 17:12.459
It's true.

17:12.511 --> 17:13.844
Uh, I think in another life,

17:13.878 --> 17:15.545
I would have liked
to work with my hands more.

17:15.547 --> 17:18.013
There's something
about setting your mind

17:18.050 --> 17:21.268
to a task and seeing the
tangible fruits of your labor.

17:24.473 --> 17:26.106
There, you done good now, sir.

17:26.141 --> 17:28.725
Just, uh, the rest...
the rest is a one-man job.

17:31.063 --> 17:33.396
You know?

17:33.448 --> 17:36.116
You should consider taking
James as an apprentice.

17:36.151 --> 17:37.567
He's as smart as you.

17:37.569 --> 17:39.569
He might be a little bit smarter.

17:40.906 --> 17:42.122
I'm sure he'd pick up things real quick.

17:42.157 --> 17:43.573
How'd you like that?

17:43.575 --> 17:46.376
Oh, that-that'd be... that'd
be real nice, sir, real nice.

17:46.411 --> 17:48.078
Now you let me know when that
wheel's finished, straightaway.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.246
Oh, yes, sir, yes.

17:49.298 --> 17:50.330
All right.

18:00.842 --> 18:03.593
At least we know the harness holds.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.451
Quick now.

18:21.162 --> 18:22.862
Here, let me do it.

18:27.286 --> 18:29.953
Noah made sure there's
one in there for you too.

18:30.368 --> 18:32.122
If you comin' with us.

18:35.294 --> 18:36.626
With Moses,

18:37.269 --> 18:39.930
h-how you know when you love him?

18:40.785 --> 18:42.182
Well, you ask him,

18:42.217 --> 18:44.267
he'd tell you we fell
in love the night we met

18:44.303 --> 18:46.186
at a plantation dance.

18:46.221 --> 18:48.021
But it took me a little while longer.

18:49.059 --> 18:51.391
He was always talking
about his preaching.

18:51.443 --> 18:53.665
Enough so I'd go see for myself.

18:55.480 --> 18:59.199
Back then, he was all lanky and sweaty.

18:59.234 --> 19:01.401
All over the place.

19:01.453 --> 19:04.241
His command for the Word was wanting,

19:04.273 --> 19:06.905
but his passion was not.

19:07.804 --> 19:12.128
He went walking through
the slaves spreading hope.

19:12.164 --> 19:15.665
And when he came to me, he just stopped.

19:17.836 --> 19:19.349
As did my heart.

19:20.232 --> 19:22.005
And it ain't never beat right again.

19:28.764 --> 19:30.180
Music.

19:31.233 --> 19:32.682
It stopped.

19:50.419 --> 19:51.980
Rosalee.

19:52.754 --> 19:54.009
Yes, ma'am.

19:55.374 --> 19:57.374
I'll have my lemonade out on the porch.

19:57.426 --> 19:59.542
Not too bitter this time.

20:14.893 --> 20:16.976
Did you need something?

20:21.817 --> 20:23.483
This tunnel will allow your cargo

20:23.535 --> 20:25.535
to enter the house when it's safe.

20:25.570 --> 20:28.071
We can move the nursery down
here and cover the hideaways.

20:28.073 --> 20:30.407
There's a clear line of sight
to the river from here.

20:30.409 --> 20:33.076
This will let those seeking know
this is a safe haven.

20:33.078 --> 20:35.078
About how long should we be expecting

20:35.130 --> 20:36.579
to harbor runaways at a time?

20:36.581 --> 20:37.747
"Cargo."

20:37.749 --> 20:39.082
Right, "cargo."

20:39.134 --> 20:42.552
This is how you move cargo?

20:42.587 --> 20:44.587
How often do you cross
with law enforcement?

20:44.639 --> 20:46.589
More frequently as of late.

20:46.641 --> 20:48.641
The old governor turned
a blind eye mostly.

20:48.677 --> 20:49.926
But the new one is looking to D.C.

20:49.928 --> 20:51.010
I heard he's increased

20:51.063 --> 20:52.595
the marshal presence in the area.

20:52.597 --> 20:54.230
Boat patrols as well.

20:54.266 --> 20:56.245
Used to be a foot in Ohio
is a foot in freedom.

20:56.980 --> 20:59.495
Now the battlefield
has extended across the river.

21:00.613 --> 21:02.605
We need soldiers as well as saints.

21:03.050 --> 21:05.018
And what about spies?

21:06.549 --> 21:08.995
Elizabeth and I are attending
the governor's ball tonight.

21:09.030 --> 21:10.280
That's an exclusive invitation.

21:10.332 --> 21:12.115
One my firm gets every year.

21:12.117 --> 21:13.783
If Ohio and the marshals
are coordinating their efforts,

21:13.785 --> 21:15.835
evidence of that could be found
in the governor's office.

21:15.871 --> 21:18.588
Like patrol schedules
and names of new marshals.

21:18.623 --> 21:21.419
Information that would put us
at a considerable advantage.

21:36.691 --> 21:39.277
First time I hit a white man, shit...

21:40.479 --> 21:42.061
that felt like freedom.

21:46.485 --> 21:47.890
But it wasn't.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.988
Landed me in the stocks,
overseer's eyes glued on my ass.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.563
That small taste of victory
wasn't worth the trouble.

21:55.410 --> 21:58.133
Nah, but you don't want to hear
nothing about that, do you?

21:58.830 --> 22:01.095
You just want to kill them all.

22:02.717 --> 22:06.002
I know what it feels like not
to have control over nothing,

22:06.054 --> 22:09.353
not able to protect yours
the way a man supposed to.

22:10.175 --> 22:13.426
And all that anger,
all that pain you feelin'...

22:13.478 --> 22:15.693
there's gonna be plenty
on the run to work that out on.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.598
Maybe by the time we get up North,

22:18.650 --> 22:20.447
you'll be able to leave it behind.

22:21.937 --> 22:23.284
Start fresh.

22:27.826 --> 22:30.243
Noah was gonna leave you in this box.

22:30.278 --> 22:31.361
Leave you behind.

22:31.413 --> 22:33.029
But I stuck out my neck
to Mr. Bill for you

22:33.031 --> 22:34.197
'cause I know the only person

22:34.249 --> 22:36.583
Noah's gonna look out for is that boy.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.454
Now, I say...

22:41.506 --> 22:43.623
we look out for each other.

23:02.727 --> 23:04.277
Run with me.

23:04.312 --> 23:06.646
You ain't cut out
for something like this.

23:06.698 --> 23:09.032
I ain't scared.

23:11.987 --> 23:13.620
Everybody out front right now.

23:18.376 --> 23:19.909
Momma, what's wrong?

23:19.961 --> 23:21.578
Miz Suzanna on another one
of her warpaths.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.796
Massa's seal gone missin'
and she up my ass about it.

23:23.832 --> 23:25.481
Don't worry.

23:25.483 --> 23:28.251
If one of these girls got it,
I find it quick.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.875
I don't ask much of you.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.638
Work ethic.

23:42.482 --> 23:43.795
Loyalty.

23:43.831 --> 23:44.963
Honesty.

23:45.404 --> 23:47.435
And what do I get in return?

23:48.002 --> 23:49.801
I get lying. And thieving.

23:49.837 --> 23:52.087
Bitin' the hand that feeds you.

23:53.841 --> 23:55.794
That slaver is coming back tonight.

23:56.637 --> 23:58.805
I would no sooner bat an eyelash

23:58.840 --> 24:01.263
than put the whole
lot of you in my pocket

24:01.265 --> 24:03.432
just like that child killer.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.771
Miss Suzanna?

24:09.773 --> 24:11.940
I done seen one of the field slaves

24:11.992 --> 24:12.908
creepin' about earlier.

24:12.943 --> 24:14.443
Which one?

24:14.495 --> 24:16.772
I... couldn't tell.

24:17.681 --> 24:18.774
But I'll think on it.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.371
No matter.

24:22.703 --> 24:24.953
My husband will take care of it.

24:26.448 --> 24:28.986
This has turned out to be an
eventful Sunday, now, hasn't it?

24:29.760 --> 24:30.697
Now...

24:31.572 --> 24:33.795
we can do this all day.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.263
And we will.

24:35.299 --> 24:36.738
'Cause I'm a patient man.

24:38.212 --> 24:41.263
Any one of you could end this
at any time.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.893
If I don't have that seal
back in my possession

24:47.945 --> 24:50.897
by the time the last of these
railroad ties hit the ground,

24:50.922 --> 24:52.491
it's gonna be 50 lashes

24:53.117 --> 24:55.117
for every single one of you.

25:11.752 --> 25:13.835
They always talkin' heaps

25:13.837 --> 25:15.921
about us stealin' when they
know they done it first.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.807
Went over to Africa
and round us up like horses.

25:18.842 --> 25:21.476
You really think she seen
one of 'em round this way?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.106
You three, go get the rest of

25:26.131 --> 25:27.764
the wax paper from the storehouse.

25:40.030 --> 25:41.879
Where is it?

25:45.085 --> 25:46.668
I don't know...

25:48.422 --> 25:49.671
Lie to me again.

26:17.901 --> 26:20.118
I'm sorry, Momma,
I didn't mean nothing...

26:20.154 --> 26:22.904
We gonna get to the why, believe you me.

26:22.906 --> 26:26.334
But right now, I got to figure
a way to fix your mess.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.919
Do you know where
the governor's office is?

26:37.921 --> 26:40.082
Just upstairs on the left.

26:41.058 --> 26:44.086
I'll have a better chance
to slip up unnoticed alone.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.928
You ready to do this, "Bitsy"?

27:30.641 --> 27:32.807
... quite different than it is here.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.059
Or even up North.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.027
Oh, and the shows. Mon dieu.

27:36.063 --> 27:37.145
There's this dance I saw.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.030
It was splendid.

27:49.826 --> 27:51.409
Oh, perfect timing.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.711
John, my brightest barrister.

27:52.746 --> 27:53.712
Help me out here.

27:53.747 --> 27:54.829
We're discussing the Scott case.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.164
There's not much to discuss.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.999
The law says his kind
don't have rights in court.

27:58.001 --> 27:59.167
Could you please tell the marshal

27:59.169 --> 28:01.169
it's more complicated than that?

28:01.171 --> 28:02.504
I can't.

28:02.556 --> 28:05.090
My legal opinion actually
falls in line with Kyle.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.475
The current law has Mr. Scott in chains.

28:07.527 --> 28:09.060
Well, I've had too many.

28:09.096 --> 28:10.228
John Hawkes is agreeing with me.

28:10.264 --> 28:12.681
Well, we're both officers of the law.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.733
Marshal Risdin. You wanted a moment?

28:14.768 --> 28:15.684
Sir.

28:15.686 --> 28:17.519
Yes, Governor, I want to show you

28:17.521 --> 28:18.737
the map of our boat patrols.

28:18.772 --> 28:20.689
Let's talk in my office.

28:21.703 --> 28:24.192
This looks to be a dying effort.

28:24.194 --> 28:26.628
Your last chances are waning.

28:29.283 --> 28:32.867
And yet not one of you
has said a word about my seal.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.036
Go on, Rosalee.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.393
Your eyes don't need
to bear witness to this.

29:11.575 --> 29:14.125
Just one group left,

29:14.161 --> 29:16.544
and there's lashes for all of you.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.011
I got you, Ma.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.812
I got you.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.348
You already holdin' up her end.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.816
You ain'thelpin' us none.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.068
We all right, just... just hold steady.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.074
No, no.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.682
No, no! Leave him.

30:03.718 --> 30:06.102
I like his fire.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.686
It won't burn forever.

30:14.112 --> 30:16.062
Come on. We can do it.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.731
Moses.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.282
Move your right arm

30:20.318 --> 30:23.702
three fingers closer to your left.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.238
Noah, kick that right arm back now.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.290
Kick it!

30:28.326 --> 30:30.459
Henry, get under Pearly Mae's left.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.212
Fight for it.

30:33.247 --> 30:35.047
You know you can.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.832
Fight for it.

30:40.288 --> 30:41.720
Fight!

31:08.199 --> 31:10.616
Thomas Roberts!

31:10.618 --> 31:12.251
Where did you get that?

31:12.286 --> 31:13.419
Pa's office.

31:18.292 --> 31:20.709
Ernestine! Rosalee!

31:22.213 --> 31:24.430
Clean up this mess.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.686
And let my husband know
I found his seal.

31:52.793 --> 31:54.543
Who takes a business meeting

31:54.579 --> 31:56.378
in the middle of a gala in their honor?

31:56.414 --> 31:58.547
A man with two left feet.

32:01.135 --> 32:02.301
Risdin and the governor

32:02.336 --> 32:03.502
are blocking the stairs to his office.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.671
You need a distraction.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.141
You remember Boston?

32:09.177 --> 32:12.311
I wager I remember Boston
far better than you do.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.142
You would win that wager.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.080
I'm much less certain
it's that sort of crowd.

32:19.586 --> 32:22.438
It is always that sort of crowd.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.919
Laney.

32:36.954 --> 32:38.671
Teach us that dance.

32:38.706 --> 32:39.538
Sure.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.260
I'm sorry to call on you like this.

34:08.295 --> 34:10.618
Came across some
unexpected cargo at the river.

34:10.620 --> 34:12.880
Trouble is, all the stations
in the area are full.

34:12.933 --> 34:14.016
Where's the cargo now?

34:14.051 --> 34:15.100
In your shed.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.101
I know you're not
fully prepared yet, but...

34:17.138 --> 34:18.387
We'll figure it out.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.306
I'll get some blankets

34:20.308 --> 34:21.857
and what food I can muster up.

34:21.891 --> 34:23.641
Don't want to miss the cargo
I was scheduled to pick up.

34:23.643 --> 34:24.643
Let me walk you out.

34:24.695 --> 34:25.811
I need to share with you the information

34:25.862 --> 34:26.978
that we got from the governor's.

34:27.031 --> 34:29.315
Ports, times, manpower...

34:35.539 --> 34:37.156
It's all my fault.

34:38.292 --> 34:39.291
I froze.

34:39.873 --> 34:41.159
Ain't know what to do.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.547
It ain't just on you.

34:45.862 --> 34:47.203
We all had a hand in it.

34:50.221 --> 34:51.637
What went down today
is just another example

34:51.672 --> 34:53.755
why we got to get out of here.

34:55.426 --> 34:58.010
If we go, we leavin'
James and Momma behind.

34:58.045 --> 35:00.045
You know how much I love him, but...

35:02.249 --> 35:04.249
... Momma left me behind
long ago, when she

35:04.285 --> 35:05.851
moved into that big house.

35:06.358 --> 35:08.106
I know you think that but...

35:08.656 --> 35:11.157
you don't know how hard she work
to make life better for us.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.220
Protect us.

35:14.462 --> 35:16.195
And I needed it today.

35:18.499 --> 35:21.077
It's suffocatin' bein'
in the massa's house.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.188
Ain't never a moment to be yourself.

35:25.406 --> 35:27.373
At least, out here, no matter how small,

35:27.408 --> 35:29.274
least you got somethin' of your own.

35:30.745 --> 35:34.113
Me and Momma just a shadow
in somebody else's world.

35:39.553 --> 35:40.986
You ain't scared?

35:41.914 --> 35:43.555
Not even a little?

35:43.591 --> 35:46.502
No. No.

35:50.865 --> 35:52.008
I am.

35:55.069 --> 35:57.180
You were right.
I ain't made for runnin'.

36:02.268 --> 36:04.460
Will you tell Noah for me?

36:08.299 --> 36:09.692
Way Noah talkin', I...

36:10.251 --> 36:12.070
I think he'll need
to hear that from you.

36:32.573 --> 36:33.939
Hand me them hooks.

36:44.084 --> 36:45.284
Ain't nobody gonna think twice about

36:45.286 --> 36:48.036
a fishing lure left at the riverbed.

36:48.088 --> 36:50.622
These hooks are gonna be ready
for a quick run, every night.

36:52.956 --> 36:54.927
We gonna cross that bridge in six days.

36:55.433 --> 36:57.796
Seems longer than it did
this morning, don't it?

36:57.798 --> 36:58.964
Five days, now.

37:00.801 --> 37:03.018
We got a strong group.
Proved that today.

37:03.518 --> 37:04.720
We can muster through it.

37:04.772 --> 37:06.555
All I want to do right now is take that

37:06.607 --> 37:08.440
big old spoon in the sky and
fill the whole river with it.

37:08.476 --> 37:09.608
I'd drink every drop.

37:11.028 --> 37:12.311
What spoon?

37:13.197 --> 37:14.413
Them stars.

37:14.448 --> 37:15.614
Yeah, you see?

37:15.649 --> 37:17.318
Starting with the big one, right there.

37:23.374 --> 37:24.990
I'll be goddamn.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.658
If massa hadn't near wore us out today,

37:26.660 --> 37:27.993
we might never cracked it.

37:28.438 --> 37:29.995
See, the sun rises on the right,

37:30.047 --> 37:32.998
sets on the left, that means
that that big spoon in the sky

37:33.050 --> 37:34.735
always points north.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.837
Follow the drinking gourd.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.005
Come on, boy.

37:40.057 --> 37:41.757
You just figured out a part
of the map to freedom.

37:52.653 --> 37:53.902
Hey, girl!

37:56.023 --> 37:57.489
Hey!

37:57.525 --> 37:59.431
I know you hear me talkin' to you.

38:00.548 --> 38:01.915
Come here.

38:03.102 --> 38:04.580
Come here.

38:28.722 --> 38:30.666
That's a nice dress.

38:33.227 --> 38:36.111
Nicer than anything my Peggy ever wore.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.137
She was my wife.

38:48.959 --> 38:51.145
Passed before I came here.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.610
Sick one day, gone the next.

39:12.149 --> 39:14.168
She's buried at the church.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.757
Just a simple stone.

39:23.677 --> 39:25.844
I know some people, they...

39:25.879 --> 39:29.448
they go in for them real fancy
gravestones, you know?

39:31.385 --> 39:32.384
Mausoleums, too.

39:34.922 --> 39:36.655
I'm sure you seen 'em.

39:36.690 --> 39:38.824
I think my Peggy would've liked

39:38.859 --> 39:41.493
somethin' simple, you know?

39:41.528 --> 39:45.197
She, uh... she wasn't

39:45.232 --> 39:47.849
one for frivolities, you know?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.458
But still, I...

39:54.975 --> 39:57.225
I-I liked to surprise her, you know,

39:57.277 --> 40:00.896
with somethin' nice,
every now and then, you know?

40:04.868 --> 40:07.536
I could pick some flowers for you,

40:07.571 --> 40:09.655
put on her grave next Sunday.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.830
That'd be real nice.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.862
You think you're better
than me, don't you?

40:51.915 --> 40:52.700
Don't you?

40:53.446 --> 40:54.728
Speak up, girl!

40:59.373 --> 41:02.874
You like when the boss's uppity friends,

41:02.876 --> 41:05.043
they fawn all over you,

41:05.095 --> 41:07.963
but not poor, sad Bill, huh?

41:08.015 --> 41:10.515
Massa expectin' me back at the,
at the big house, is all.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.934
I ain't gonna let no nigga gal
stick her nose up at me!

41:24.565 --> 41:26.148
No, no!

41:28.452 --> 41:31.570
Hey, go on and get
started guttin' dinner.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.705
I'm gonna take the long way around.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.041
Trying to get a look
at that girl, ain't you?

41:40.798 --> 41:42.047
Get over here!

41:46.754 --> 41:48.887
Oh, let me go!

42:12.613 --> 42:14.696
Rosalee?

42:14.748 --> 42:15.747
Rose...

42:15.783 --> 42:16.865
Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose.

42:16.917 --> 42:17.833
What happened?

42:17.868 --> 42:19.951
We-we-we have to go. Now.

42:19.953 --> 42:21.286
No, we can't, we can't. We got to plan.

42:21.338 --> 42:22.921
No, we gotta run. Now.

42:23.957 --> 42:25.707
He dead.

43:21.732 --> 43:23.098
I know you the man.

43:23.150 --> 43:25.066
You sold my wife.
