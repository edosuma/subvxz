00:00.001 --> 00:02.601
Scott: <i> Previously on</i> Teen Wolf...

00:02.602 --> 00:03.936
Liam: Where are you going?
Paris.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.437
You have orientation tomorrow.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.406
You're going to be
safe 3,000 miles away.

00:07.408 --> 00:13.012
I'm here to guide you, not
push, not prod, guide.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.480
We can't leave.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.848
Who are you?

00:15.850 --> 00:19.752
Someone who recognizes raw
talent when he sees it.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.977
He's gaining too
much ground on us,

02:24.979 --> 02:27.012
we should be moving faster.

02:30.116 --> 02:32.518
You're talking like an amateur.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.653
An amateur that
killed a hellhound.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.355
Who was wounded and bleeding.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.423
And I took out a werewolf.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.559
Also injured and alone.

02:40.561 --> 02:43.495
Let's not mistake
luck for skill.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.697
The longer we wait, the
weaker he will be.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.167
And the more time he'll
have to find help.

02:48.169 --> 02:52.337
"The greatest victory is that
which requires no battle."

02:52.339 --> 02:54.706
Sun tzu. Got it.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.942
Can we at least keep moving?

02:58.379 --> 03:00.112
Did you hear that?

03:02.048 --> 03:03.615
It's him.

03:42.789 --> 03:45.757
Mason: No. No.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.792
No!

03:47.861 --> 03:49.161
You swear you weren't cheating?

03:49.163 --> 03:50.562
I swear to god.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.364
Fine. One more game.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.567
I have to get back to studying.

03:55.569 --> 03:59.471
Uh, you need any
help with anything?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.440
What, you wanna help me study?

04:01.442 --> 04:04.509
I'm your best friend,
i can help you study.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.545
Nah, go home, dude.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.617
Uh... You, you mind if I...

04:11.619 --> 04:14.186
I mean is, is it cool if...

04:15.256 --> 04:17.221
What, you wanna stay over?

04:17.224 --> 04:19.358
Yeah, is that all right?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.493
I mean, yeah, if
you tell me why.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.395
What do you mean why?

04:23.397 --> 04:26.999
Maybe I just wanna hang out.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.234
What about Corey?

04:30.503 --> 04:33.305
Nah, he's at a
library study group.

04:34.674 --> 04:37.843
We haven't had a sleepover
since we were 10.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.846
What's going on?

04:49.555 --> 04:53.225
You remember that
body that we found?

04:54.594 --> 04:58.030
You know, the one
without the face?

04:59.633 --> 05:02.034
I can't get it out of my head.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.171
Yeah, me, too.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.774
No. Dude, I'm...

05:08.776 --> 05:11.610
I mean, I, I literally

05:11.612 --> 05:14.012
can't get it out of my head.

05:19.585 --> 05:21.987
You know what after images are?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.290
Uh, you mean, like, when
you look at a light bulb

05:25.292 --> 05:27.459
and when you look away you
still kind of see it?

05:27.461 --> 05:29.428
Yeah.

05:31.130 --> 05:36.501
Well, there's this more extreme
version called palinopsia.

05:38.938 --> 05:42.007
It literally means
"seeing again."

05:43.176 --> 05:46.912
I mean, the image just
stays with you...

05:47.914 --> 05:51.216
And you see it again.

05:51.617 --> 05:53.785
And again.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.322
So, where are you
seeing the body?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.961
Everywhere.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.045
Lori...

06:58.618 --> 07:00.185
Lori: I found this.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.654
It's Brett's, and he's
missing, and I heard gunshots.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.989
How do you know
this is his blood?

07:03.991 --> 07:07.125
Because he's my brother.
It's mine, too.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.294
Get it together, Melissa.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.625
Oh, god!

08:46.627 --> 08:47.993
Okay.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.231
Oh, god!

09:06.246 --> 09:07.846
Hey.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.881
I thought you were hanging
out with Liam tonight?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.616
Brett's missing.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.919
"Missing," as in no one can find
him and they're really worried?

09:13.921 --> 09:18.957
"Missing," as in his sister found
blood all over his lacrosse stick.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.426
Why's our missing
always involve blood?

09:21.428 --> 09:23.228
Because it's beacon hills.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.163
Come on, we're meeting Lydia.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.231
How come?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.699
Because we're gonna go find him.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.712
You all right?

09:40.714 --> 09:42.981
Yeah, why?

09:43.950 --> 09:46.251
Just checkin'.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.787
No, it's okay, i
don't see anything.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.488
Huh?

09:50.490 --> 09:51.890
Nothing.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.892
Quiet! Please.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.360
Both: Sorry.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.665
She ever tried this before?

10:02.568 --> 10:05.303
Initiating a premonition?

10:05.305 --> 10:06.705
A few times.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.441
They usually find her.

10:11.043 --> 10:13.645
How will it help us find him?

10:13.647 --> 10:15.380
I don't know.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.683
But if Brett's dead, i
think she'd already know.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.354
Do you think it's working?

10:22.356 --> 10:24.723
It might if you stop talking.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.245
Both: Sorry.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.392
Liam: Here.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.328
I think he set a trap.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.863
He's fighting back.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.265
And now we know he's alive.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.504
But he's still hurt. We need to find
him, he needs to know we're here.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.741
You want the hunter to
know we're here, too?

11:49.743 --> 11:51.876
He's new. We can take him.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.144
Malia: What if Brett howls back?

11:53.146 --> 11:55.680
He'll lead the
hunter right to him.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.315
No, we could find him first.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.051
There's no human that can track
sounds faster than we can.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.853
And we've got the advantage,
we've done this before.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.022
We know what we're doing, guys.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.990
How come I can't
catch his scent?

12:05.992 --> 12:07.092
Lori: He's masking it.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.727
Malia: Can someone
tell him not to?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.695
He went this way.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.332
His trap didn't work.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.534
Maybe this hunter is
not such an amateur.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.437
Or maybe he's learning.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.746
Corey: Does anyone
speak Chinese?

12:28.647 --> 12:30.381
My phone does.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.823
Lux-v...

12:38.825 --> 12:41.960
No, it's a Roman numeral, "68."

12:41.962 --> 12:43.094
Mason: "Sixty-eight."

12:43.096 --> 12:44.896
That's what the
Chinese says, too.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.097
"E, r."

12:46.099 --> 12:48.733
"E, r." "E, r," what?

12:49.301 --> 12:51.269
Erbium.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.404
The atomic number
for erbium is 68.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.273
Corey: What if this whole
thing just says "68"?

12:55.275 --> 12:58.076
Mason: "Sixty-eight" what?
I have no idea.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.345
Okay, so what do we try next?

13:00.347 --> 13:02.647
I'm going back to where
my last premonition was.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.518
And I'm going alone.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.688
I'm surprised you called me.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.425
Well, someone had
to call someone.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.628
I need a tissue
sample from a body.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.264
I was hoping you would go
in there and get it for me.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.535
It's a dead body? Right?

13:58.971 --> 14:00.371
Mostly.

14:03.142 --> 14:04.442
Mostly?

14:04.444 --> 14:07.512
Maybe you should just
go see for yourself.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.087
That's not just a dead body.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.989
You felt it, too, didn't you?

15:24.991 --> 15:26.591
Yeah. Fear?

15:27.927 --> 15:30.094
Terror.

15:37.703 --> 15:38.970
The trail ends.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.673
Gerard: The trail ends
when you've found him.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.441
Remember what I told you?

15:43.443 --> 15:46.344
Look for signature prints,
look for heel marks.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.179
And why the heel marks?

15:48.181 --> 15:50.315
Because the heel
comes down first.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.582
It bears all the weight.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.217
So what do you see?

15:54.687 --> 15:56.387
No prints, nothing.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.922
And that tells you what?

15:57.924 --> 15:59.490
It's a misdirect.

15:59.492 --> 16:03.594
Good. And what does that tell
us about our young wolf?

16:05.097 --> 16:07.165
Monroe: He feels us
closing in on him,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.701
he wants to escape the pressure.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.103
Don't ask yourself what
a teenager would do,

16:12.105 --> 16:15.039
ask yourself what
an animal would do.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.641
An animal would run and hide.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.311
And where do wounded
animals go to hide?

16:28.253 --> 16:31.689
They go underground.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.127
Lydia: Sixty-five, 66,

16:36.129 --> 16:40.398
67, 68.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.520
"Sixty-eight."

17:32.151 --> 17:33.851
I've seen it, too.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.654
What are you talking about?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.156
How he shows up out of nowhere.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.525
Don't pretend you
haven't noticed.

17:43.495 --> 17:46.464
I'm not sure what I've seen.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.933
Do you wanna be sure?

17:53.572 --> 17:57.875
If you really wanna
know, i know a way.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.914
Malia: The trail's gone.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.184
Scott: Uh, maybe he
just stopped bleeding.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.919
Liam: God, I think
we should split up.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.121
Lori and I go this way,
you guys go that way.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.556
Or maybe we go in
four directions?

18:11.558 --> 18:13.424
We should stick together.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.426
We have the advantage,
it's four against one.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.028
Not if we split up.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.130
Right. I've been doing this the past
three months without your help.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.965
I think I can make a decision.

18:20.967 --> 18:24.035
Well, if you're deciding to do something
stupid and die, then go ahead.

18:24.037 --> 18:27.071
It's one hunter, one amateur who
doesn't know what they're doing.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.573
Scott?

18:35.247 --> 18:38.483
The hunter. He's
covering his tracks.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.618
Scott: There's another.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.253
Two of them?

18:42.255 --> 18:43.688
Maybe more.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.857
How many hunters have you
seen out here before?

18:47.426 --> 18:49.293
A lot.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.262
Still wanna split up?

18:51.264 --> 18:52.864
We can deal with it.

18:52.866 --> 18:55.032
We just need to
find Brett's trail.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.567
No, we don't.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.970
Rock balancing.
Satomi taught us.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.973
It's him, and I know
where he's going.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.621
He's been poisoned.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.822
That's why he's not healing.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.457
What if he only has a
few hours to live?

19:19.459 --> 19:20.958
Well, if we howl,
we can find him.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.226
That's too risky.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.961
Who cares about the risk?
He could be dying.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.030
He's still moving.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.767
We just need time to think.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.802
I need him to know that I'm
here, that I'm coming for him.

19:31.804 --> 19:35.039
Yeah, Lori's right. He
has to know we're here.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.240
Liam, wait!

19:55.961 --> 19:57.695
How did he get behind us?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.897
He didn't. That wasn't Brett,

19:59.899 --> 20:03.000
that was a werewolf
making a mistake.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.702
Monroe: His friends
are coming for him?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.705
Gerard: It's safe to assume
they're coming for us.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.740
Why are we going back?
What if there is a pack?

20:09.742 --> 20:13.844
Oh, there is. We
can count on it.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.714
Wait, how many are
we talking about?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.049
That's not the right question.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.684
You're thinking from
a place of fear.

20:29.928 --> 20:32.763
I'm thinking logically
and mathematically.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.266
Two of us against
too many of them.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.867
Try thinking strategically.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.704
That's Scott McCall's
achilles' heel.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.607
Like most teenagers, he
thinks with his heart.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.475
So what's our strategy?

20:44.477 --> 20:46.377
Right now?

20:46.379 --> 20:48.813
Divide and conquer.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.720
Melissa: Okay.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.656
There's a perfectly logical
explanation for this,

20:58.658 --> 20:59.890
but if it moves...

20:59.892 --> 21:02.326
I'll empty a clip into it.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.302
Sorry.

21:12.504 --> 21:14.305
Talk.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.540
What?

21:16.542 --> 21:19.010
You said there's a
logical explanation.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.512
Tell me what it is.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.514
You mean to distract myself?

21:24.249 --> 21:25.483
And me.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.817
Okay.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.219
Okay, okay.

21:28.887 --> 21:31.122
Okay, sure.

21:31.124 --> 21:35.793
It could be a toxin or gases,

21:35.795 --> 21:37.261
chemicals released by the body.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.729
This thing?

21:38.731 --> 21:40.598
Yeah. Carbogen,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.566
carbon dioxide and oxygen gas

21:42.568 --> 21:46.637
mixed can, uh, make your brain
think that you're suffocating,

21:46.639 --> 21:49.907
and then your body reacts with
intense anxiety and fear.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.643
What else?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.579
Any noxious smells
can induce fear.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.215
Or even infrasounds,

21:58.917 --> 22:00.584
sounds below 20 hertz.

22:00.586 --> 22:01.919
Just do it.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.587
Yeah.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.755
Melissa, now.

22:06.725 --> 22:08.059
Melissa!

22:09.261 --> 22:10.328
I got it!

22:18.570 --> 22:19.870
Why didn't he answer?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.839
Maybe, maybe, he didn't hear us.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.274
Maybe, he can't.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.314
Lori, no!

22:51.504 --> 22:52.870
They knew we were coming.

22:52.872 --> 22:56.474
Don't talk, just heal, and
let us figure this out.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.442
They've been a step ahead
of us the whole time.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.911
I'm sorry, but i can't wait around.
We have to go.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.947
We still have the
numbers, three-to-two.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.515
We're faster, and
we're stronger.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.850
They're smarter.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.518
I don't care who's smarter
or faster or whatever,

23:07.520 --> 23:08.786
my brother's going to die.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.921
Something's not right.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.858
That arrow, the trip
wire, the poison.

23:13.860 --> 23:14.992
These aren't amateurs.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.160
But they've never
fought us before.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.295
And you've never
fought hunters, Liam.

23:18.297 --> 23:19.397
We need to stick together.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.865
I need to go.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.433
No, you're not going alone.
I'll go with you.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.102
Liam, you don't
know who they are

23:25.104 --> 23:26.570
or what they're capable of.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.172
Liam: Look, i know who we are.

23:28.174 --> 23:32.777
We never give up, especially
when it's someone innocent,

23:32.779 --> 23:35.446
when it's someone alone, when
it's one of our friends.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.717
Okay, go, go. All of
you, I'll catch up.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.853
Go, Malia, go with them.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.725
I just need a minute, go.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.994
You just need to shut up.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.503
I think the scary part's over, this
is just the boring science part.

24:00.705 --> 24:03.774
I'm not gonna leave you
alone with that thing.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.846
I bet you wanna know what
scared the hell out of you.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.248
I'm curious.

24:11.250 --> 24:15.052
Let me guess, not very much.

24:17.088 --> 24:18.522
Very little.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.136
What is it?

24:36.041 --> 24:37.975
It's nothing.

24:37.977 --> 24:41.479
No DNA, no cell structure,
there is nothing here.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.147
How is that possible?

24:43.849 --> 24:44.982
It's not.

24:57.230 --> 24:58.529
Which way?

24:58.531 --> 24:59.964
There's gotta be something.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.366
Did he leave anything
for you to find, like,

25:02.368 --> 25:04.335
like a signal, or, more rocks?

25:04.337 --> 25:05.903
I don't see anything.

25:06.571 --> 25:08.005
I don't hear anything.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.908
We'll find something.
He's gonna be okay.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.643
How do you know?

25:14.145 --> 25:16.046
'Cause, 'cause he's strong.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.917
He's really strong.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.753
He's knocked me down on the
lacrosse field more than once.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.055
Now, when i see him coming,

25:25.057 --> 25:27.791
I do everything I can to get
the hell out of the way.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.562
Brett actually started
playing lacrosse for me.

25:31.564 --> 25:32.930
For you?

25:32.932 --> 25:34.965
I didn't have any friends
at my old school.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.701
Devenford prep needed
lacrosse players,

25:37.703 --> 25:40.237
and Brett practiced all summer.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.873
And he got a scholarship
and told them that

25:42.875 --> 25:45.409
they had to take me
if they wanted him.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.747
Hey, we're gonna find him.

25:57.656 --> 25:59.189
Do you smell that?

25:59.191 --> 26:01.892
It's... it's sour.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.461
It smells like
something's rotting.

26:07.699 --> 26:08.999
I think it's poison.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.435
That's how we'll find him.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.282
It's been too long.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.517
Don't worry,

26:27.385 --> 26:29.320
they'll have to come this way.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.822
How do you know?

26:31.824 --> 26:35.793
Well, I wouldn't be down here if I
didn't know exactly where I was.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.275
Why did you let them go?

26:51.277 --> 26:55.479
Because this isn't about
killing just one werewolf.

26:57.983 --> 27:02.353
Sixty-eight miles, 68 degrees...

27:03.722 --> 27:05.823
Route 68?

27:05.825 --> 27:08.258
Lydia will call us when
she has something.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.928
Yeah, I just wish
i could be there.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.596
You know, to help her...

27:12.598 --> 27:14.031
Be alone?

27:14.033 --> 27:16.533
Yeah, good point.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.504
Hey, Nolan.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.108
Studying for bio test?

27:25.543 --> 27:27.111
Trying. Yeah.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.947
Um, trying to understand

27:29.949 --> 27:32.282
how organisms evolve and change.

27:33.952 --> 27:37.054
Like, how a fish can
turn into an alligator.

27:37.756 --> 27:40.591
Uh, alligators aren't fish,

27:40.593 --> 27:42.326
um, they're reptiles.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.228
They, they hatch from
fertilized eggs...

27:44.230 --> 27:46.964
And isn't the test
on DNA versus rna?

27:48.099 --> 27:50.234
Do you think DNA changes?

27:51.970 --> 27:54.371
If it's damaged, yeah.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.241
A change in DNA
could cause cancer.

27:57.809 --> 27:59.743
So organisms can change,

27:59.745 --> 28:02.813
organisms change.

28:02.815 --> 28:06.350
They can change right
in front of your eyes.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.853
I don't think this
is on the test.

28:09.855 --> 28:15.292
Yeah. I wonder if
organisms can change,

28:16.461 --> 28:18.228
and then change back.

28:18.230 --> 28:23.500
Like, they can be
two things at once.

28:25.170 --> 28:29.440
Uh, parrotfish are
protogynous hermaphrodites,

28:29.442 --> 28:31.041
both male and female.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.911
Um, hawkfish change
and change back.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.480
As well as earthworms,
of course, but...

28:36.482 --> 28:38.148
Corey: That's definitely
not on the test,

28:38.150 --> 28:41.118
or any high school test.

28:41.120 --> 28:46.623
I wonder if any of
us have changed.

28:46.625 --> 28:50.394
And if we did, would there
be any way to tell?

28:52.630 --> 28:55.365
Like a DNA test?

28:57.569 --> 29:01.371
I was thinking a different
type of test...

29:06.511 --> 29:08.078
Ow!

29:08.080 --> 29:09.713
What the hell is wrong with you?

29:13.685 --> 29:16.320
Look, look at him. Look!

29:20.525 --> 29:22.860
Wait, he's fine.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.394
It's just a scratch.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.512
Malia: How did we miss that?

29:43.849 --> 29:46.750
Scott: We underestimated them.

29:46.752 --> 29:50.087
Malia: But, how did they
rig a trap that big

29:50.089 --> 29:52.022
with us down here
in the tunnels?

29:54.626 --> 29:58.228
Scott: They didn't. They
rigged it a long time ago.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.064
But we've been through these
tunnels a hundred times.

30:01.066 --> 30:03.267
And whoever this hunter is,

30:03.269 --> 30:05.435
he's been through
them a hundred more.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.839
And he knew we were here, he was
waiting for us, tracking us.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.975
He was prepared and we weren't.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.554
There aren't a lot of people who
spend time in these tunnels.

30:23.556 --> 30:26.290
Who was the last hunter
we saw down here?

30:27.458 --> 30:29.126
Argent...

30:30.595 --> 30:32.062
And Gerard.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.864
The trap wasn't lethal.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.432
It slowed us down.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.700
And split us up.

30:36.702 --> 30:39.169
He's planning something
else, another trap.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.071
And Liam and Lori are
walking right into it.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.252
Sorry.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.257
Hey, sixty-eight.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.426
Hey. Hey.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.695
Do you know anything
about Brett?

31:04.697 --> 31:05.829
Who?

31:05.831 --> 31:08.498
Brett Talbot. Lacrosse player.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.167
What happened to him?

31:10.169 --> 31:11.835
I don't know any Brett.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.374
You're one of them, aren't you?

31:17.376 --> 31:18.642
One of who?

31:23.848 --> 31:26.383
Lori: They all look the same, are
you sure we're going the right way?

31:26.385 --> 31:28.986
I'm positive. I've gotten lost
down here before, more than once.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.020
Just follow the scent.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.489
I hate that scent. Wait.

31:32.491 --> 31:36.260
I hear something.
It sounds like...

31:36.262 --> 31:38.195
A heartbeat.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.172
Brett!

31:51.075 --> 31:52.309
You found the rocks.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.177
Yeah, I found the rocks.

31:55.313 --> 31:58.448
Liam. Hey, we're gonna
get you out of here.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.318
You're a dumbass for doing this.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.653
Oh, is that your way
of thanking me?

32:02.655 --> 32:06.390
No, that's my way of
calling you a dumbass.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.592
But, thanks.

32:20.772 --> 32:21.872
They're coming.

32:21.874 --> 32:23.173
Okay, go, I'll hold 'em off.

32:24.543 --> 32:25.609
Go, go!

32:47.298 --> 32:48.832
There's nobody here.

32:49.901 --> 32:50.968
Lori.

32:53.037 --> 32:56.306
Monroe: Seems like we're letting a
lot of opportunities pass us by.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.808
Gerard: I know we only just met,

32:57.810 --> 33:00.077
but I'm gonna have to ask you
to trust me a little longer.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.412
I'm generally not a
very trusting person.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.815
That's why you are
gonna be good at this.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.116
Good at what?

33:06.118 --> 33:07.718
I thought we're trying
to hunt down a werewolf.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.120
Anyone can learn to
hunt one werewolf.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.488
We are building an army.

33:12.223 --> 33:13.323
An army?

33:13.325 --> 33:16.493
To hunt them all.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.043
I'm sorry.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.145
Let me try again.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.780
Scott: No, no, no,
it's just not working.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.815
I don't think that we
should waste any more time.

33:38.817 --> 33:39.883
Quiet.

33:47.291 --> 33:48.425
Why isn't it working?

33:48.427 --> 33:50.227
How come i can't take your pain?

33:50.229 --> 33:51.428
It's okay.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.164
No, it's not okay.
None of this is okay.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.199
We should've called stiles.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.868
We promised we wouldn't.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.302
It was a stupid promise.

33:59.304 --> 34:00.637
We almost lost him last time.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.706
Yeah, and now I'm
gonna lose you, too.

34:05.076 --> 34:06.977
"You?" You're gonna lose...

34:06.979 --> 34:09.513
Yeah, me. All of us.
You know what I mean.

34:09.514 --> 34:11.681
Yeah, I think so.

34:11.683 --> 34:16.119
And, you know, stiles
wouldn't be okay with this.

34:16.121 --> 34:19.056
If he knew all the things that we
were trying to do without him,

34:19.058 --> 34:20.690
he'd, he'd kill us.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.193
I think he'd be okay.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.661
With this?

34:26.097 --> 34:27.230
With us...

34:28.099 --> 34:30.300
What do you mean?

34:30.302 --> 34:32.335
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't pass out.

34:32.337 --> 34:34.237
I don't think you're
supposed to pass out.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.739
Plus, I'm really confused by what we're
talking about, so, Scott, wake up.

34:36.742 --> 34:37.808
Scott?

34:54.992 --> 34:56.525
What happened?

34:56.661 --> 34:57.828
It worked.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.243
Now, you let me know
if you wanna upgrade

35:13.245 --> 35:15.178
to something with a
little more kick.

35:15.180 --> 35:18.682
Oh, I... I think this
is good enough for now.

35:18.684 --> 35:20.317
Okay.

35:20.319 --> 35:24.287
Uh, you let me know if you remember
anything about your family history

35:24.289 --> 35:26.923
that deals with any of the bizarreness
that we've been dealing with.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.859
Bodies with no DNA?

35:28.861 --> 35:32.629
Or bodies with no DNA that
somehow make you feel terrified.

35:32.631 --> 35:36.700
I don't know if the body's
actually causing the fear.

35:36.702 --> 35:40.370
Maybe it's just amplifying it?

35:40.372 --> 35:42.005
You still feel it, don't you?

35:42.007 --> 35:43.740
Yeah, it's like something
crawling on the back of my neck.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.408
Me, too.

35:47.512 --> 35:49.980
Well, if you find
anything, uh...

35:49.982 --> 35:52.382
I'll call. Great.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.017
Or I'll call if i
remember anything.

35:54.019 --> 35:55.252
Okay. Or not.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.521
Okay, okay.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.993
I should've called.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.063
But you didn't, and that's okay.

36:08.866 --> 36:11.168
Should I have called?
Did you wanna call?

36:11.170 --> 36:12.469
Yeah, I wanted to call.

36:13.037 --> 36:14.804
So did I. Good.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.106
Yeah. Yeah.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.441
Okay, good.

36:18.443 --> 36:20.710
That is good
information to have.

36:23.881 --> 36:25.448
I should go.

36:27.451 --> 36:28.885
You don't have to go.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.027
Lydia: It was about Nolan.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.629
Would've been nice to know
before he attacked me.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.965
No, he wasn't
trying to hurt you.

36:44.468 --> 36:46.369
He was trying to expose you.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.371
That was a test.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.307
Well, you definitely failed.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.510
It was a geyser, half
the library staring.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.145
You didn't even have a scratch.

36:55.147 --> 36:57.080
Yeah, I remember, because it
was, like, five minutes ago.

36:58.382 --> 36:59.816
Why would Nolan do that?

36:59.818 --> 37:00.850
He's afraid.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.787
Of me? Of us.

37:03.789 --> 37:06.923
I thought your premonition was about
people turning on each other?

37:07.858 --> 37:09.025
I was wrong.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.532
They're gonna turn on us.

37:23.541 --> 37:25.475
And I think it's
already started.

37:34.585 --> 37:37.120
Just a little further,
we're almost out of here.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.304
Lori, no!

38:00.645 --> 38:02.078
Lori, wait!

38:02.847 --> 38:04.180
Lori, wait!

38:21.266 --> 38:22.399
No...

38:53.164 --> 38:54.597
Close your eyes.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.508
I couldn't take away his pain.

39:26.931 --> 39:28.064
Liam.

39:53.691 --> 39:54.991
Monroe: You set this up.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.192
Of course I did.

39:57.161 --> 39:58.428
Is this part of the lesson?

39:58.430 --> 40:01.297
Everything's a lesson,
every moment with me.

40:01.299 --> 40:04.501
And if there's one thing you
learn today, it's this,

40:04.503 --> 40:09.305
the best way to build an
army is through fear.
