WEBVTT

00:08.857 --> 00:12.266
- Where the fuck have you been hiding?
- I messed up.

00:12.892 --> 00:15.258
<i>-Where you staying?
- Back at the flat.</i>

00:15.536 --> 00:19.120
<i>-What, you're squatting?
- No, Selby sorted it.</i>

00:20.025 --> 00:22.460
So, Florian Selby's
back in the free world.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.139
<i>-God help us all.
- When the shit hits the fan,</i>

00:25.139 --> 00:28.584
<i>-sometimes you need a man like Selby.
- That's just not true.</i>

00:29.766 --> 00:32.550
- I've gotta go to work.
- I'll make it up to you, yeah?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.803
How are we this fine morning?

00:38.152 --> 00:41.283
Tired. And I've got
a gushing case of the thrush.

00:41.596 --> 00:44.204
Not perfect conditions
for showing my minge.

00:45.214 --> 00:47.127
But, hey, at least we're not homeless.

00:47.127 --> 00:48.798
Heard you got rolled
by the Feds the other night.

00:48.798 --> 00:51.511
Yeah, me and the kid got accused
of breaking and entering

00:51.511 --> 00:53.946
into our own home,
which is fucking madness.

00:54.782 --> 00:56.835
- All sorted now?
- Yep.

00:56.835 --> 00:58.608
Normal service has resumed.

00:58.608 --> 01:01.148
I'm skint
and shit out of luck, as usual.

01:07.063 --> 01:09.081
Get on the Only Fans like everyone else.

01:09.081 --> 01:11.377
No, I don't want that shit
on the internet.

01:12.456 --> 01:15.170
And I want people to take
my writing seriously.

01:19.136 --> 01:20.110
Okay.

01:21.224 --> 01:24.215
Pussy check, ladies. Chop, chop.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.847
Costello Jones, isn't it?

01:46.168 --> 01:48.917
- Who the fuck are you?
- Sophie Fenster.

01:48.917 --> 01:52.084
<i>I... I write for the London Reformer.
I follow you online.</i>

01:52.084 --> 01:55.528
I'm... I'm a big fan
of what you write and stand for.

01:55.528 --> 01:59.112
I think you're mistaken, darling.
I don't stand for a fucking thing.

02:05.861 --> 02:10.384
- I don't talk to journalists either.
- No, I... I get it. We... we're awful.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.124
Do you wanna see my fanny?

02:14.072 --> 02:17.412
I'm not here to judge you.
I'm here to pass the mic.

02:18.178 --> 02:21.413
Well, be prepared
to have it returned sticky.

02:23.188 --> 02:26.597
I'd love to do an interview
with you, Costello.

02:26.910 --> 02:33.033
Fuck your interview, I'm a writer.
I tell my own stories. Thank you.

02:37.626 --> 02:39.331
Come on, you fucking slut.

02:41.349 --> 02:44.410
Okay, well,
how about you write your story?

02:45.175 --> 02:47.959
About working here. In your own words.

02:49.282 --> 02:52.621
- Yeah, but I want paying for it.
- Well, how much do you want?

02:53.700 --> 02:57.492
Five hundred.
And I'm not writing any sad stories.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.553
I'm not gonna be your liberal's
victim of the week.

03:00.553 --> 03:03.267
I think this might be the break
you've been dreaming of.

03:03.267 --> 03:08.312
What is this? A fucking job center?
Take off your knickers, come on.

03:14.853 --> 03:17.149
- Fuck you, I'll do it.
- Yes.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.594
Yes. Yes.

03:22.472 --> 03:24.387
It was well weird when you weren't here.

03:24.838 --> 03:28.944
Mom went wine crazy.
I think I'm gonna need therapy.

03:29.710 --> 03:34.093
- Who do you think you are? Tony Soprano?
- Well, I'm more of a Christopher type.

03:34.963 --> 03:38.789
And I don't want none of that CBT crap.
It's Dr. Melfi or nothing.

03:38.789 --> 03:39.833
Oh, you want to go private, do you?

03:40.147 --> 03:41.191
- Harley Street?
- Yeah.

03:41.191 --> 03:42.617
Well, look, it never worked for me,

03:42.617 --> 03:44.635
but I can certainly
look into it for you.

03:53.055 --> 03:54.273
How long you
are you gonna keep this up for?

03:54.273 --> 03:56.151
I've apologized like 15 times.

03:56.951 --> 04:00.570
- What you apologizing for?
- Dad, everything.

04:01.057 --> 04:04.570
Taking a selfie with that hot dead guy.
And getting pissed at work.

04:05.266 --> 04:07.910
Taking a shit in the mourners' toilet
and blaming it on the old widow.

04:08.885 --> 04:10.867
Driving the hearse while high
on E that time--

04:11.146 --> 04:15.565
- Stop talking.
- Do a girl a favor and forgive me.

04:17.270 --> 04:18.279
Good job on him.

04:21.445 --> 04:22.871
How many guests we got?

04:24.228 --> 04:27.150
Poor old bastard had hardly any family
and no money, so probably none.

04:27.707 --> 04:30.908
But make it nice. Put some music on,
in case someone does show up.

04:35.849 --> 04:37.658
Now, don't show 'em
to Fen, he's a big cheat.

04:38.493 --> 04:41.276
I don't need to cheat
to beat a child.

04:41.763 --> 04:42.772
Go easy on him.

04:44.998 --> 04:47.434
So, what was it like
looking after your mom?

04:48.095 --> 04:49.069
Tiring.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.757
It was a nightmare.
I was very frightened.

04:53.557 --> 04:55.157
And sometimes
I thought I'd never get out.

04:55.157 --> 04:58.497
Never get away from her.

04:58.985 --> 05:02.846
- Well, it sounds horrible.
- She made me sleep in a bunk bed.

05:03.647 --> 05:05.804
- No, that's cool.
- No, it wasn't cool.

05:05.804 --> 05:08.448
Creaked every time I turned over,
the mattress was lumpy

05:08.796 --> 05:10.918
and the sheets scratched my skin.

05:11.475 --> 05:15.302
Liar. He was in prison,
not visiting his mum.

05:15.302 --> 05:16.555
Shut up.

05:17.633 --> 05:21.530
- What's he saying?
- Nothing. Now, say "Mahjong."

05:23.617 --> 05:26.470
- Mahjong!
- And take everyone's money.

05:29.219 --> 05:32.768
No. When you win, you don't say
"Mahjong" you say, "Hu Le."

05:33.568 --> 05:37.430
- So, you lose.
- Hu Le!

05:40.317 --> 05:41.779
Little cunt.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.110
Watch your mouth.

06:26.104 --> 06:29.025
- This looks like my kinda party.
- Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

06:29.652 --> 06:30.835
Nah, it's fine, mate.

06:37.619 --> 06:39.046
I am sorry for your loss.

06:40.646 --> 06:41.864
Let's get a look at him then.

06:47.430 --> 06:49.900
This is the first time
I seen him in 45 years.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.032
He looks better than I remember.

06:54.563 --> 06:57.520
- I'll give you some time alone.
- Would you mind staying?

06:58.356 --> 06:59.677
Wanna have a drink with the old man.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.644
Start that track again, will ya?
He'd have loved it.

07:08.723 --> 07:10.881
As long as you're not expecting
me to dance for you.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.327
Not for me.
I don't day drink... no more.

07:33.425 --> 07:34.399
Fuck it.

07:46.994 --> 07:48.038
To Dad.

07:58.093 --> 08:01.328
Selby, I feel like I'm
in a movie montage.

08:01.989 --> 08:03.938
That's how I live my life.

08:04.459 --> 08:06.408
Just make sure
it's a good movie, darling.

08:10.792 --> 08:11.801
Mahjong!

08:17.263 --> 08:21.368
- Is this disrespectful?
- From what I remember of him,

08:21.716 --> 08:24.048
this might be the only thing I've done
that would've make him proud.

08:52.089 --> 08:55.429
- Hello, bubs.
- How's the genius writer doing?

08:58.213 --> 08:59.395
Come on, you need a break.

09:01.623 --> 09:05.554
Just need to make sure
that this is really good.

09:05.554 --> 09:09.102
Yes, it will be, just stick some duck
in your gob and take five minutes.

09:12.512 --> 09:15.191
- Give me a sec.
- Come on!

09:18.183 --> 09:20.375
Can't believe you're writing
for those champagne socialists.

09:20.375 --> 09:21.801
Look, look, look.

09:22.288 --> 09:23.889
The only way they'd let you
into the liberal palace

09:24.167 --> 09:25.838
is if you're bloody cleaning it.

09:25.838 --> 09:28.725
I'll just have to break the locks then.

09:31.578 --> 09:32.553
Here.

09:41.946 --> 09:43.964
Wish we could do this
all again tomorrow.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.861
- We can't 'cause Ava's party.
- Hmm.

09:48.313 --> 09:50.227
Can we get her a decent present?

09:52.557 --> 09:55.688
Can't give rich people shit
from Argos, can you?

09:59.969 --> 10:03.064
- I love you.
- Love you too.

10:04.595 --> 10:08.387
Costello, I've got a new man.
He's old as fuck, let me in.

10:09.153 --> 10:11.554
- Hey!
- How you doing, all right?

10:12.771 --> 10:15.938
- This is Paul.
- I can't believe you've done this.

10:16.946 --> 10:18.268
Chill out, you soppy bitch.

10:18.268 --> 10:20.113
Dad was gonna throw it
in the skip anyway.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.983
- Selby is here.
- Is he?

10:25.366 --> 10:28.533
Well, we aren't afraid
of Florian Selby, are we, Paul?

10:28.533 --> 10:33.542
- Might be. Who's Florian Selby?
- Yes, Gloria, who is Florian Selby?

10:34.343 --> 10:36.673
- Some public school prick.
- Objection!

10:36.673 --> 10:40.605
- And he just got out of prison.
- For protecting Costello, Paul.

10:41.058 --> 10:45.754
This is all very entertaining,
but I do have a deadline, tomorrow.

10:45.754 --> 10:50.416
Yes. Thank you for stopping by.
Absolute pleasure to meet you, Paul.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.443
And, uh, if you are planning intercourse
with this one,

10:53.443 --> 10:55.113
may I suggest three condoms.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.714
Two on the cock,
one on the head, just be safe.

10:57.061 --> 10:58.523
Costello, he's insane.

11:03.706 --> 11:07.568
This is why you were locked up,
Selby. Go away!

11:27.261 --> 11:28.513
That's not helping.

12:09.463 --> 12:11.272
Lenny, are you decent?

12:20.561 --> 12:21.883
Aren't you filthy?

12:25.641 --> 12:26.615
Right.

13:05.304 --> 13:06.278
Here we go.

13:13.027 --> 13:14.001
Sir.

13:18.212 --> 13:19.498
We're waiting for you to start.

13:26.179 --> 13:27.153
Ah, yes.

13:29.310 --> 13:30.284
Yes.

13:32.754 --> 13:33.728
Gentlemen...

13:36.686 --> 13:37.834
welcome to Punch Club.

13:40.373 --> 13:43.923
First rule of Punch Club,
you don't punch anyone.

13:45.384 --> 13:50.811
Second rule of Punch Club,
you do not punch anyone,

13:51.125 --> 13:53.978
seriously, it defeats the purpose of you
being here. It's kind of the point.

13:53.978 --> 13:57.770
- The third rule of Punch Club...
- What are you doing?

13:59.544 --> 14:01.040
I'm your new group leader.

14:01.353 --> 14:04.415
- God.
- What's your name?

14:05.528 --> 14:08.103
- Selby.
- Fucking dickhead.

14:08.103 --> 14:10.086
- Florian Selby.
- That's right.

14:10.086 --> 14:11.303
Sit down, please, Florian.

14:18.088 --> 14:19.236
My name is Matt.

14:19.549 --> 14:21.462
And this is a rehabilitation group
for men

14:21.462 --> 14:23.028
who have committed violent crimes.

14:23.933 --> 14:26.647
You should know it is a requirement
of your probation to regularly attend

14:26.647 --> 14:29.778
this group
or you will be returned to prison.

14:31.378 --> 14:32.388
This is no joke.

14:43.555 --> 14:44.530
Would you...

14:54.411 --> 14:55.385
Thank you, darling.

14:55.906 --> 14:57.577
<i>I'm writing a thing
for the London Reformer</i>

14:57.959 --> 15:00.291
and they are getting
all the gory details, so...

15:00.291 --> 15:02.169
Come on, do your worst.

15:02.621 --> 15:05.578
Be as filthy as you like,
it's all going in my article.

15:06.275 --> 15:08.501
Well, don't they dare change my name.

15:08.501 --> 15:12.642
I'm Lenny Wilson. Proud pervert.
Don't piss on my hard-on.

15:13.685 --> 15:19.078
I may not be famous for my art.
But I wanna leave something behind.

15:20.226 --> 15:22.348
What are you doing? You cold?

15:22.348 --> 15:26.489
Oh, no, darling, just nothing worse
than frigid hands on a warm cock.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.472
Oh, God...

15:29.620 --> 15:33.864
Tell your readers
why I've been banned from the peep show.

15:33.864 --> 15:39.188
Because it's bad etiquette to spunk
on a peep booth window. It stains.

15:41.414 --> 15:43.363
Wokeness gone mad.

15:44.858 --> 15:48.059
Not my fault I've got stubborn cum.

15:50.669 --> 15:55.296
You are a cleaner, Costello.
You've done such a good job.

15:57.036 --> 15:58.984
You're a real cleaner, aren't you?

15:59.749 --> 16:02.219
Tell me you're a real cleaner,
I've always wanted one.

16:02.916 --> 16:04.725
Yes, I'm a real cleaner.

16:09.351 --> 16:10.918
I mean, it really isn't coming out.

16:10.918 --> 16:12.274
I'll have to get
some white vinegar on it,

16:12.274 --> 16:14.536
but want me to keep going?

16:18.363 --> 16:20.346
I knocked my missus around for years.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.634
She always let me back.
But I'd never change.

16:26.539 --> 16:32.105
This time though, it's different.
Tell you what it is.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.334
Paintball.

16:40.455 --> 16:43.240
I go paintball every Saturday.

16:44.248 --> 16:49.432
Shoot a load of kids,
treat myself to some extra ammo,

16:49.849 --> 16:53.016
smoke bombs, armed to the teeth.

16:53.677 --> 16:57.817
Get generations of violence
out of my system.

17:00.669 --> 17:01.713
Then I go home.

17:02.618 --> 17:07.871
Missus cooks a nice bit of dinner.
We make love. Lovely.

17:11.385 --> 17:14.064
Oh, my God! I think I prefer prison.

17:17.683 --> 17:21.302
Matthew, who do I need
to suck off to get out of here?

17:39.985 --> 17:44.960
Ugh. It's an awful life we live,
but we do it with such dignity.

17:48.369 --> 17:49.413
Thanks, babe.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.727
Lenny, can I steal one
of your paintings?

17:54.109 --> 17:55.884
Iris has a birthday party.

17:56.232 --> 17:58.668
Better take a present
for the mom, stuck-up bitch.

17:59.364 --> 18:00.650
Take... take that.

18:02.669 --> 18:03.956
Your ex-wife's vag?

18:04.721 --> 18:09.975
- You can't give that away.
- She always did, very generous woman.

18:13.558 --> 18:15.228
What does that remind me of?

18:15.228 --> 18:18.847
How should I know it? All I see is gash.

18:20.377 --> 18:23.927
You're like a dad to me Lenny.
One who rapes me.

18:27.197 --> 18:28.589
Oh, God.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.929
Might work.
Really looks like a pussy though.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.469
Oh, oh, I love it.

18:40.209 --> 18:41.670
Thank you.

18:43.097 --> 18:47.272
That is a very moving sunset.

18:47.619 --> 18:51.899
It looks familiar.
Somewhere in India, perhaps?

18:52.282 --> 18:54.857
I see a symbol of transience.

18:55.969 --> 18:59.449
Oh, I don't think we're looking
at something tangible.

18:59.449 --> 19:00.492
Right.

19:02.963 --> 19:07.416
So, Iris told Ava you're a writer.

19:09.469 --> 19:10.513
Yes.

19:10.513 --> 19:12.461
What are you working on
at the moment?

19:12.948 --> 19:18.062
An undercover, uh, project.
At... at a peep show.

19:18.793 --> 19:20.324
That is fascinating.

19:20.324 --> 19:23.525
Yeah. I mean,
I get right in amongst it. It's...

19:23.525 --> 19:25.334
What, like Stacey Dooley?

19:25.647 --> 19:30.240
Yeah, a little bit.
But think more Tom Wolfe,

19:30.623 --> 19:34.728
Joan Didion, you know,
like, reporting the truth, subjectively,

19:34.728 --> 19:36.954
using fictional techniques.

19:37.337 --> 19:40.155
- Sounds amazing.
- You are very bright.

19:40.608 --> 19:43.112
You should have gone to university.

19:43.112 --> 19:47.670
I did.
I got a first in English at Durham.

19:48.853 --> 19:50.071
Well.

19:50.071 --> 19:53.654
I might have a cracking pair of tits,
but I'm also pretty fucking clever...

19:55.185 --> 19:56.646
We can't wait to read it.

20:03.187 --> 20:07.815
- Oh, God.
- And it's in.

20:16.095 --> 20:19.122
Costello, a respectable man
is here for you.

20:20.235 --> 20:21.697
- Come.
- Hi. Hi, Costello.

20:21.697 --> 20:24.410
- Yeah.
- I'm Richard. Hi.

20:26.114 --> 20:29.455
I'm here to...
Yeah, get some photos for your article.

20:30.047 --> 20:33.665
Um, everyone else here,
you can just relax, like I'm not here.

20:34.847 --> 20:37.840
I read some
of your old pieces online the other day.

20:38.431 --> 20:41.005
Very funny.
I'm looking forward to this one.

20:41.458 --> 20:42.502
Thanks.

20:43.581 --> 20:45.668
Where do you want me?

20:48.590 --> 20:50.261
- Yeah, wherever you're comfortable.
- Okay.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.600
Yeah.

20:54.644 --> 20:57.984
That's very nice. Very good.
Yeah. To me. Oh, yeah.

20:59.306 --> 21:04.316
Just head down, just a touch.
Yeah. Wonderful. Well done. Yeah.

21:07.239 --> 21:08.421
What do you think? Cool, yeah?

21:10.649 --> 21:12.214
Right, shall we get a picture
of you in your costume?

21:12.528 --> 21:13.536
No.

21:14.754 --> 21:17.885
No one asked Hemingway
to get his tits out, did they?

21:22.304 --> 21:26.444
<i>- Good night with Aunty G?
- Yeah, showed her The Sopranos finale</i>

21:26.826 --> 21:31.037
- and she said she felt cheated.
- What do you expect? It's Aunty G.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.228
God, look at this prick on his scooter.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.917
Today, Mommy,
your name's gonna be in the newspaper,

21:37.264 --> 21:41.092
- and not for a crime.
- Yeah, you're right.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.631
All my friend's moms
are gonna read about it.

21:43.631 --> 21:46.971
And soon we won't be poor.
You're a real writer now.

21:47.250 --> 21:50.485
Yeah, suppose I am.
I am a real writer.

21:51.912 --> 21:54.382
What you got?
A fucking paper round?

21:55.286 --> 21:56.712
Her Majesty treat you well?

21:56.712 --> 21:59.044
As well as she would treat
one of her sons.

22:00.435 --> 22:02.801
Prison's like boarding school I bet.

22:02.801 --> 22:05.062
No, no, no, no, no,
it's much lovelier than that.

22:13.831 --> 22:15.153
It's not your article, darling.

22:15.153 --> 22:17.970
They've turned your words
into a sad little interview.

22:23.816 --> 22:24.894
They fucked me.

22:27.329 --> 22:28.652
Of course she lied to me.

22:41.872 --> 22:42.846
Come on.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.352
Come on, come, come, come.

22:49.597 --> 22:52.901
Costello Jones says, "I'm not ashamed
to use my body to pay the rent."

22:52.901 --> 22:55.058
"Sex work is real work."

22:55.649 --> 22:57.528
I never fucking said that.

23:02.887 --> 23:05.079
Iris is gonna be so embarrassed.

23:06.644 --> 23:08.036
God, I want a drink.

23:10.506 --> 23:11.550
No, you don't.

23:11.550 --> 23:15.446
I'm 106 days sober, is this my life now?

23:15.829 --> 23:19.447
Why can't I have a glass of wine
like a normal human being?

23:19.447 --> 23:22.057
Because, darling, when you drink,
bad things happen.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.771
I knew it was risky, writing this.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.251
Well, writing
is the most dangerous sport.

23:34.338 --> 23:35.695
Do you want me to have her whacked?

23:37.678 --> 23:42.688
Fuck her. She's going in my novel,
and she's going to be a fucking monster.

23:42.688 --> 23:47.628
Yeah, well, the best revenge, of course,
is winning the Man Booker Prize.

23:54.935 --> 23:57.301
They would have done
the same to Jean Genet

23:57.301 --> 23:59.040
if he had a cunt, wouldn't they?

24:00.850 --> 24:01.858
Undoubtedly.

24:05.372 --> 24:08.017
<i>Fuck her. Just keep doing your writing.</i>

24:08.782 --> 24:11.635
- What you calling this book?
- Oh, fuck knows.

24:12.574 --> 24:17.515
I need to get my head down,
finish it, find a publisher...

24:19.081 --> 24:21.029
finally make Iris proud.

24:22.108 --> 24:24.264
I gotta hand it to you,
you don't die easy.

24:29.344 --> 24:30.352
Why you are here?

24:30.701 --> 24:34.006
There's still customers out there
with handfuls of coins and cocks.

24:36.232 --> 24:38.634
Done for the night,
so I'll see you next week.

24:39.225 --> 24:40.373
Get back on stage.

24:51.228 --> 24:55.647
Okay then, get your hairy ass
out of here. You're fired.

24:55.647 --> 24:57.560
She ain't got no hairy ass.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.683
And don't forget
to take your pussy with you.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.909
And I ain't no pussy. Rude!

25:05.563 --> 25:07.128
Do you think he's got
little man syndrome?

25:07.128 --> 25:09.285
- Yeah.
- He's a bit of a weirdo.

25:09.598 --> 25:11.094
Solidarity, sister.

25:12.277 --> 25:15.269
As performative gestures go,
I've seen better.

25:16.278 --> 25:17.809
- Seen better today.
- What's this?

25:18.575 --> 25:20.835
The photographer from that thing.

25:20.835 --> 25:22.993
Yeah, I... I just wanted you
to know that

25:22.993 --> 25:25.046
I had no idea
that Sophie was going to fuck you over.

25:25.671 --> 25:27.655
I mean, it is fucking weird,

25:27.655 --> 25:30.020
but you've got to hand it to him.
Done a thing.

25:30.856 --> 25:34.091
Would you like to grab
a coffee or something?

25:35.205 --> 25:38.649
Do you pick up girls
outside peep shows often or...

25:38.649 --> 25:41.920
Uh, no. No, no, this...
this would be my first.

25:43.032 --> 25:45.016
Well, he's good value, ain't he?

25:47.834 --> 25:49.956
- Okay, go on then.
- Yeah?

25:51.278 --> 25:55.245
Taking real risk with that one.
Big old mouth on her.

25:55.245 --> 25:59.385
- And very mangled minge.
- Thank you for that, Konstantin.

26:00.115 --> 26:01.437
Well, no one's perfect.
