00:19.083 --> 00:20.619
There was a time

00:20.625 --> 00:22.616
when about the worst thing
you could say about a man

00:23.083 --> 00:24.619
was that he was a horse thief.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.616
In some places,
that's still true today,

00:27.625 --> 00:30.116
particularly when the horse
that gets stolen

00:30.125 --> 00:31.615
belongs to a king.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.115
And it's considered to be

00:33.125 --> 00:35.616
maybe the most
expensive horse alive.

01:08.166 --> 01:10.657
When's it's a tribal leader
who does the stealing,

01:10.667 --> 01:13.158
you've got the makings
of a small war.

01:13.667 --> 01:15.157
And 'cause small wars
have a way

01:15.667 --> 01:17.157
of becoming big ones,

01:17.166 --> 01:19.157
it saves a lot of trouble
if the horse gets back

01:19.166 --> 01:20.155
to where it belongs.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.740
No!

02:30.750 --> 02:31.739
Don't shoot!

02:31.750 --> 02:33.741
You'll hit the horse!

03:34.834 --> 03:36.290
Typical.

03:36.291 --> 03:38.828
Just when you're getting ahead,

03:38.834 --> 03:40.825
somebody always
changes the odds.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.825
Halt!

03:49.834 --> 03:52.325
He is mine.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.324
You know, we could go back
to your place

04:11.333 --> 04:12.322
and talk about this.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.870
Nah, didn't think so.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.331
Hyah!

04:37.375 --> 04:39.366
Kill him!

05:49.458 --> 05:50.447
I'm with you, pal.

05:50.458 --> 05:53.450
I hate heights.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.491
You know, my life is
like a rubber ball.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.991
No sooner
do I get the horse returned,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.993
and I bounce right
into another assignment.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.992
Intelligence agents
are a very cautious bunch.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.537
Take Nicolai Grodsky,
for example,

07:04.542 --> 07:06.533
an old buddy of mine.

07:06.542 --> 07:08.533
He's got some
top secret information,

07:08.542 --> 07:09.998
and, like any good agent,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.537
he'll only hand it over
to someone he trusts,

07:12.542 --> 07:14.999
in this case, me.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.991
And that's just fine.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.991
I get to visit Budapest again.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.992
And having a big road rally
in town is like a bonus.

08:12.583 --> 08:14.073
Sorry.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.073
Hey!

08:17.083 --> 08:18.072
No!

08:23.583 --> 08:25.619
Good opening move.

08:25.625 --> 08:28.082
Nice fast dip,
good carry.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.074
On a scale of one to
ten, ten being best,

08:30.083 --> 08:32.073
give you about a
six, maybe a seven,

08:32.082 --> 08:33.619
but you looked
down at your hand.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.616
That's a
cardinal no-no!

08:35.625 --> 08:37.616
You gypsy?

08:37.625 --> 08:40.082
No, not that
I know of.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.619
Why?

08:41.625 --> 08:45.117
'Cause it takes a gypsy
to catch a gypsy.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.114
You look American.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.615
Want a guide?

08:47.625 --> 08:49.616
Jana is the best.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.115
I don't think I'll
be needing no guide.

08:51.125 --> 08:53.116
I've been here quite
a few times before.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.114
Thank you.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.116
Okay, then I sell you
a special gypsy blessing.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.615
Keep you safe.

08:57.625 --> 08:58.614
Sell? You wanna
sell me something?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.115
I just caught you...
Okay, okay.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.615
For free.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.115
'Cause you caught me.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.114
That's right.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.661
Taught me a lesson.
Uh-huh.

09:05.667 --> 09:06.656
For free.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.658
All right!

09:14.125 --> 09:16.116
Go in safety.

09:16.125 --> 09:18.662
Find what you seek.

09:18.667 --> 09:19.656
Thank you, Jana.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.658
That was very nice.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.657
She did it again!

09:55.709 --> 09:59.702
He has been walking around
for three hours.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.700
Grodsky is a cautious man.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.165
Not surprising in
a double agent,

10:03.166 --> 10:05.202
which is why Moscow
wants pictures

10:05.208 --> 10:06.698
of whomever he contacts.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.700
The watch looks very valuable.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.200
Valuable? It contains the name

10:11.208 --> 10:13.699
of a dozen key KGB agents
in England.

10:13.709 --> 10:17.201
We want the watch and Grodsky
and his contacts.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.700
Yo, Grods!

10:22.709 --> 10:23.698
MacGyver!

10:23.709 --> 10:26.746
I didn't expect you,
old friend.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.742
Yeah, kind of a
surprise to me, too.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.741
A pleasant one,
I might add.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.206
How are you
doing, Nicki?

10:33.208 --> 10:36.200
With you as my contact now,
perfect.

10:36.208 --> 10:39.200
I have the names
in my watch, but not here.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.199
The Cafe Mozart,
remember?

10:48.750 --> 10:51.241
Keep taping!

10:55.750 --> 10:56.739
Whoo!

10:59.250 --> 11:00.740
Here's your
newspaper, sir.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.240
Oh, thank you.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.786
Grodsky!

11:08.792 --> 11:11.784
Nicolai Grodsky!

11:29.291 --> 11:30.781
Is he all right?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.282
He is dead!

11:43.291 --> 11:44.280
The American

11:44.291 --> 11:46.282
he spoke to at
the trash barrel--

11:46.291 --> 11:48.282
where is he?

11:52.291 --> 11:53.280
That's him!

11:53.291 --> 11:54.280
Yo, Grods!

11:54.834 --> 11:55.823
Freeze.

11:55.834 --> 11:57.825
Now close up.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.280
Now fast-forward
until...

12:03.291 --> 12:04.326
...there.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.322
Here's your newspaper, sir.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.825
Tighter.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.825
The watch.

12:11.834 --> 12:12.823
Uh-huh.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.825
I want that girl.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.825
And the man.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.325
Both, Inspector.

12:21.834 --> 12:25.326
Well, I will try, but
it may be difficult.

12:25.333 --> 12:28.325
Inspector Messic,
I am Russian,

12:28.333 --> 12:29.322
you are Hungarian.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.867
But I'm sure we are comrades
in socialist reality.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.331
Please, Comrade Kossov,

12:34.333 --> 12:36.870
my government has
given me instructions.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.866
I am at your disposal.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.331
We will run
this man's photograph

12:40.333 --> 12:42.870
through the border control,
through all the hotels,

12:42.875 --> 12:45.366
the banks, the railways,
the airport authorities.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.366
We will find him.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.865
And have you
checked the girl?

12:50.375 --> 12:51.364
A Gypsy.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.866
Budapest has Gypsies
like a dog has fleas.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.366
They have no papers,
no addresses.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.364
They change their names...

12:57.375 --> 12:59.366
Inspector Messic,

12:59.375 --> 13:02.867
Ivan, I love Budapest--

13:02.875 --> 13:06.914
good food, excellent wine,
charming women.

13:06.917 --> 13:10.910
But if I do not
retrieve Grodsky's watch,

13:10.917 --> 13:14.364
I will return to
Moscow in disgrace.

13:14.375 --> 13:17.913
An ugly,coldcity.

13:17.917 --> 13:20.909
And if I am cold,

13:20.917 --> 13:23.909
you could freeze to death.

13:40.417 --> 13:41.406
Thank you.

13:41.417 --> 13:42.907
Thank you, thank you.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.953
Luck to you, sir.

13:44.959 --> 13:47.951
May your beauty increase,
if that were possible, ma'am.

13:47.959 --> 13:48.948
Thank you.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.950
Hi.

13:50.959 --> 13:52.950
I'm in the market for
a Swiss Army knife.

13:55.959 --> 13:57.415
Jana!

13:57.417 --> 13:59.954
Don't worry about Jana.

13:59.959 --> 14:03.406
She can vanish
like a shadow in the sunshine.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.447
All right. Okay.
I've got it.

14:31.458 --> 14:32.447
Right here.

14:32.458 --> 14:33.994
Thank you very much.

14:34.001 --> 14:35.992
Now I want the watch.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.457
Gypsies don't
need a watch.

14:37.458 --> 14:38.447
They don't tell time.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.995
Jana, don't mess with me.

14:41.001 --> 14:43.447
It's worth a lot, huh?

14:43.458 --> 14:45.995
A very good friend of mine
was killed for that watch.

14:46.001 --> 14:47.992
What do you think?

14:50.500 --> 14:54.493
Okay, MacGyver,
I'll get your watch.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.990
''Get''?

14:56.001 --> 14:58.993
You will get me the watch?

14:59.001 --> 15:01.993
I gave it to my brother, Bruno.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.991
All right, let's go talk
to your brother, Bruno.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.490
Police!

15:09.500 --> 15:10.990
Hey...

15:14.500 --> 15:16.991
Bruno!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.490
Let me go!

15:18.500 --> 15:19.489
Let me go!

15:19.500 --> 15:22.492
My brother!
My brother!

15:24.542 --> 15:26.533
They killed your friend?

15:28.542 --> 15:30.999
Yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.538
So what are they gonna do
to my family?

16:05.041 --> 16:08.033
They confess
to everything...

16:08.041 --> 16:10.032
and nothing.

16:10.041 --> 16:12.578
They tell a lie
and lie about lying.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.574
They're Gypsies.

16:14.583 --> 16:17.575
They're trying
to protect the girl.

16:17.583 --> 16:20.040
Eh, she's family.

16:20.041 --> 16:22.578
But the American...

16:22.583 --> 16:25.074
MacGyver.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.574
We have a name
and a picture

16:27.583 --> 16:29.574
while he has the watch.

16:29.583 --> 16:33.075
So, we hold them here
in Borza,

16:33.083 --> 16:34.573
and we'll continue to look

16:34.583 --> 16:36.574
for the American
and the girl.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.575
I assume
suitable pressure

16:39.583 --> 16:43.075
will be applied
to this scum.

16:43.083 --> 16:47.622
I don't like that,
Comrade Major.

16:48.625 --> 16:53.073
I will do what I must
to get the watch back.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.074
I'm not a sadist.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.074
I'm a realist.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.620
24 hours. No more.

16:59.625 --> 17:02.082
Then, my way.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.616
Shh. Hush.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.124
You want a drink, Gypsy?

17:43.667 --> 17:46.659
Ah, Gypsies,
they're like mongrel dogs.

17:46.667 --> 17:49.158
It's a public service
when you kill one.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.658
Why do they hate us?

17:54.667 --> 17:56.157
Some people are scared

17:56.166 --> 17:58.657
of anybody
who runs free.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.157
Don't worry, Jana.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.157
We'll figure a way
to get them out.

18:33.709 --> 18:35.700
Jana, you say
the supply truck

18:35.709 --> 18:37.199
gets here about 5:00?

18:37.208 --> 18:39.199
Yeah, MacGyver.

18:39.208 --> 18:42.700
But... but they search it
before it goes out.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.745
They'd be stupid not to.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.206
MacGyver,

18:58.208 --> 19:00.199
this doesn't make
any sense to me.

19:00.208 --> 19:03.200
Think of it
as a light bulb sandwich

19:03.208 --> 19:06.245
and hope they swallow it.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.741
Truck should be here any minute.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.240
Let's go!

20:49.875 --> 20:51.331
Excuse me, guys.

21:35.917 --> 21:37.908
My mom had a chili recipe

21:37.917 --> 21:39.908
that would just about
blow your socks off.

21:40.375 --> 21:44.368
Shake of this, pinch of that,
and just let it cook.

21:44.375 --> 21:46.411
I changed the ingredients
a little--

21:46.417 --> 21:49.909
salt, sugar, weed killer.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.908
I wouldn't want to eat it,

21:51.917 --> 21:54.909
but the end result should be...

21:54.917 --> 21:57.408
dynamite.

23:15.001 --> 23:17.993
Jana thought you might
want to get out of here.

23:18.001 --> 23:20.492
You American?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.489
From the street corner.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.990
Name's MacGyver.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.993
How do you arrange
this leaving?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.992
Well, I've got some plans.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.491
You guys just hang tough,
all right?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.992
Okay, guys, get crazy.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.536
Ah, get off my foot,
you...!

24:08.041 --> 24:11.033
Back to work! Back!

24:14.041 --> 24:17.033
Chili should nearly be cooked.

24:17.041 --> 24:20.033
Time to wrap this thing up.

24:56.083 --> 24:58.074
It's an escape plan!

25:52.125 --> 25:53.661
Jana, let's go!

25:59.667 --> 26:02.124
Okay, you guys, settle down.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.116
Now, where's my watch?

26:04.125 --> 26:05.661
I sold it.

26:05.667 --> 26:08.158
You sold it?!

26:14.917 --> 26:17.408
Jana's brother sold the watch

26:17.417 --> 26:21.911
to another gypsy,
a fence named Reena.

26:21.917 --> 26:25.910
Trendy little joint
she's got here.

26:25.917 --> 26:29.409
I see the beautiful people
just stopped in

26:29.417 --> 26:32.955
to have a quick cocktail
before the ballet.

26:53.458 --> 26:55.449
Evening, gents.

26:55.458 --> 26:58.450
I'm looking
for a, uh...

27:03.959 --> 27:06.450
...for Reena.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.449
Reena?

27:09.458 --> 27:12.996
That is a nice name.

27:13.001 --> 27:15.447
What is yours?

27:15.458 --> 27:17.995
MacGyver.

27:18.001 --> 27:18.990
What do you want,

27:19.001 --> 27:20.457
MacGyver?

27:21.001 --> 27:24.448
Well, now, that's
kind of personal...

27:24.458 --> 27:25.447
and important, too.

27:25.458 --> 27:28.996
Then we are
truly interested.

27:29.001 --> 27:31.447
Where do you
come from and why?

27:31.458 --> 27:34.495
What exactly is your
business with Reena?

27:34.500 --> 27:36.991
Well, now, you seem
to be asking more questions

27:37.001 --> 27:38.992
than I'm willing to answer
at the moment.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.994
Boys, boys... let's talk.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.991
See, I'm just
kind of a peace-loving guy

27:57.000 --> 27:57.989
like the rest of you.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.990
I like a good time.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.491
Let's not be ridiculous.

28:05.500 --> 28:08.492
Now that I have
your undivided attention...

28:11.500 --> 28:13.536
MacGyver,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.536
I am Reena.

28:15.542 --> 28:17.533
Why don't we talk?

28:19.542 --> 28:21.533
Okay.

28:23.542 --> 28:26.534
Excuse me.

28:26.542 --> 28:29.989
You know, I really
don't drink too much.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.538
Virtuous or suspicious?

28:33.542 --> 28:35.032
Habit.

28:35.041 --> 28:37.532
No matter.
To your health, MacGyver...

28:37.542 --> 28:39.533
which would be
in considerable risk

28:39.542 --> 28:42.041
if I sent you
back downstairs.

28:42.041 --> 28:44.532
Yeah, is there a back way
out of here?

28:44.542 --> 28:49.536
Of course. Several...
but you have to earn them.

28:49.542 --> 28:52.579
Which brings us
to business.

28:52.583 --> 28:53.572
You are American.

28:53.583 --> 28:55.574
What are you selling,
blue jeans?

28:55.583 --> 28:59.030
Buying... watches.

28:59.041 --> 29:03.034
Uh-huh. Digital or spring-wound?

29:05.041 --> 29:07.032
Old-fashioned.

29:08.041 --> 29:10.578
It's a family heirloom.

29:10.583 --> 29:14.576
Yeah, I know. I know the family
that sold it to you.

29:14.583 --> 29:18.075
Those stinking gypsy
wharf rats.

29:18.083 --> 29:20.074
If their hides were worth
the trouble,

29:20.083 --> 29:24.076
I'd have them gutted,
skinned and used as rugs.

29:24.083 --> 29:26.074
I thought you were a gypsy, too.

29:26.083 --> 29:30.577
I am. Takes one
to know one.

29:30.583 --> 29:34.075
And how do you know them,
MacGyver?

29:34.083 --> 29:36.620
Oh, call it luck.

29:38.625 --> 29:41.082
I know exactly
what you mean.

29:41.083 --> 29:44.621
Now... tell me why
this is worth

29:44.625 --> 29:46.616
so much to you.

29:46.625 --> 29:48.081
You're okay, Reena.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.074
I think I'm going to have
to be honest with you.

29:50.083 --> 29:53.120
Never say that to a gypsy.
It makes us nervous.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.116
Okay.

29:55.125 --> 29:57.616
The watch carries information.

29:57.625 --> 29:59.115
I want it, your
police want it,

29:59.125 --> 30:02.617
the Russians want
it bad enough to
kill for it.

30:19.667 --> 30:22.659
You're telling the truth.

30:22.667 --> 30:25.124
That your lie detector?

30:25.667 --> 30:31.116
Gypsy magic... and, like most
gypsy magic, a cheat, but nice.

30:31.125 --> 30:33.662
You said information.

30:33.667 --> 30:37.159
You mean political?
What kind?

30:37.166 --> 30:40.158
Let me show you.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.158
Yeah.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.157
Names...

31:06.166 --> 31:07.702
of some
of their people.

31:07.709 --> 31:10.701
Who spy on some
of your people.

31:10.709 --> 31:13.701
Yeah, something
like that.

31:13.709 --> 31:17.201
What are you offering,
MacGyver?

31:18.709 --> 31:22.201
Well, Reena, I
don't have a lot
of cash on me.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.698
Do you take plastic?

31:23.709 --> 31:25.199
I don't deal in credit.

31:41.750 --> 31:46.198
You can't afford to
buy it, MacGyver...

31:46.208 --> 31:48.745
so it's a gift.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.244
I owe you one.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.741
Taxi!

32:06.250 --> 32:07.740
Come on!

32:07.750 --> 32:10.742
Hurry up! The police
are right behind us.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.786
Got it.
Yeah.

32:20.792 --> 32:21.781
MacGyver!

32:21.792 --> 32:24.784
So you owe us
for helping you, right?

32:24.792 --> 32:26.248
Jana...

32:26.250 --> 32:28.241
It's only that we like you,
MacGyver.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.241
We want to go with you.

32:30.250 --> 32:31.239
Where?

32:31.250 --> 32:33.286
America! America!

32:33.291 --> 32:34.280
Right, right.

32:34.291 --> 32:35.781
The U. S. of A.

32:35.792 --> 32:38.784
Clint Eastwood. Coca-Cola.

32:38.792 --> 32:39.781
Jana...

32:40.291 --> 32:42.782
Girls just wanna have fun.

32:46.792 --> 32:49.283
Please.

32:52.834 --> 32:55.280
Oh, no...

32:57.834 --> 33:01.281
Can you get mechanics' overalls
for the whole family?

33:01.291 --> 33:03.282
Like a shoot. Why?

33:03.291 --> 33:05.828
'Cause we're going to have
to get across the border fast.

33:05.834 --> 33:07.825
That rally at Boot Park's
got all kinds of racing cars,

33:07.834 --> 33:10.280
and I figure we're going
to have to borrow a few.

33:10.291 --> 33:12.327
You know what I mean?

33:25.333 --> 33:28.325
I think Tamasz is
going to be unhappy
about his taxi.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.824
It's okay. We'll be in America.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.869
All right, you all know
what to do?

33:32.875 --> 33:34.866
Yes.
Let's go!

34:01.875 --> 34:05.868
A credit card can
usually get you out of a jam.

34:06.375 --> 34:09.367
I'm hoping this
will create one.

34:41.917 --> 34:43.407
So, what did he say?

34:43.417 --> 34:45.908
They found that gypsy
taxi in Boot Park.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.908
And MacGyver?

34:47.917 --> 34:49.908
Make the assumption.

34:49.917 --> 34:51.908
You may save yourself
those cold winters

34:51.917 --> 34:53.953
in Moscow, comrade.

35:17.458 --> 35:18.447
Let's go!

35:32.458 --> 35:34.995
All mobile units,
close pursuit!

36:15.500 --> 36:18.492
What is wrong
with the traffic signals?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.991
That will do no good.

36:42.000 --> 36:42.989
I'm right behind them.

36:43.542 --> 36:44.531
Motorcycle police.

36:44.542 --> 36:46.533
They got through the
traffic jam, MacGyver.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.032
Hang on.

36:57.041 --> 36:58.030
We're just going
to have to go

36:58.041 --> 36:59.030
where they can't for now.

37:05.542 --> 37:09.034
Why are all the lights
against us?!

37:17.041 --> 37:19.032
Inspector,
can't you go any faster?

37:42.583 --> 37:44.073
It's delicious!

37:52.625 --> 37:55.082
We can't go this
way, MacGyver!

37:57.625 --> 38:00.617
Into the Horvath
Building?

38:00.625 --> 38:04.618
Connect with two
underground garages?

38:25.125 --> 38:26.615
Whoa!
Whoa!

38:33.125 --> 38:34.661
Rock and roll.

38:34.667 --> 38:36.658
Is this what you
wanted it for?

38:36.667 --> 38:38.123
Not exactly.

38:38.125 --> 38:41.117
Get some duct tape
out of my pocket.

38:41.125 --> 38:42.661
Okay.

38:42.667 --> 38:43.656
We are closing in.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.123
Now, take the police radio

38:45.125 --> 38:47.116
and tape it to your transistor.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.662
Heading to intercept.

38:57.667 --> 39:00.659
They've already crossed
half the city.

39:00.667 --> 39:03.659
They are heading
for St. Ivan's.

39:03.667 --> 39:05.157
Inspector Messic here.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.657
All units, all
units seal off

39:07.667 --> 39:09.658
the Church of St. Ivan.

39:20.709 --> 39:22.700
Is this okay, MacGyver?

39:22.709 --> 39:25.155
Yeah, not bad.

39:25.166 --> 39:27.703
Now, if we can get that
up on something tall,

39:27.709 --> 39:30.155
we can blow out police radios
for a mile.

39:34.709 --> 39:35.698
That's unbearable!

39:35.709 --> 39:37.199
What is...
what's going on?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.199
Can't you turn that off?

39:59.208 --> 40:00.744
Is that your
tall building?

40:00.750 --> 40:02.206
It's the best I could do.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.199
It's terrific!

40:14.250 --> 40:16.741
Inspector Messic here.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.240
Messic here.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.740
Can you read me?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.741
This is Inspector Messic.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.240
Aah!

41:05.291 --> 41:07.282
They're heading
for the border.

42:15.875 --> 42:19.868
I sure hope your cousin's
gotten to the gate in time.

43:04.917 --> 43:06.908
No! They're in Austria!

43:06.917 --> 43:09.909
We can't afford
a major incident.

43:09.917 --> 43:12.408
Thank you,
Comrade Major.

43:21.417 --> 43:23.954
MacGyver!

43:38.959 --> 43:40.449
You got it!

43:41.959 --> 43:42.948
All right!

43:42.959 --> 43:45.951
MacGyver, how can I...?

43:45.959 --> 43:47.950
How can we...?

43:47.959 --> 43:49.449
Ah, come on,
there's nothing to it.

43:49.458 --> 43:51.949
It'll take a couple of days
to get you processed,

43:51.959 --> 43:52.994
but you're on your way.

43:53.001 --> 43:55.447
Whoo, we're free!

44:02.458 --> 44:04.995
You're leaving us now?

44:10.001 --> 44:11.992
Well, yeah, honey, I have to.

44:14.001 --> 44:15.491
Hey...

44:17.001 --> 44:19.492
Here.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.990
But you need it.

44:21.001 --> 44:22.491
Now, come on, you earned it.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.991
Jana, you don't
have to do this.

44:40.500 --> 44:42.991
You earned it.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.491
Come here.
