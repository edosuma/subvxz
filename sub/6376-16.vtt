WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:02.197
<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:02.235 --> 00:03.634
Oh, no, no.

00:04.104 --> 00:06.368
You are not the same person
I met three years ago.

00:06.406 --> 00:10.740
Betty, you've already changed,
but you're still you.

00:10.977 --> 00:13.411
- I'm an editor now.
- Really?

00:13.446 --> 00:15.971
I don't want you ever
around my mother again!

00:16.015 --> 00:17.244
What the hell is going on?

00:17.283 --> 00:20.411
He's only interested in his career
and leeching off of you.

00:20.453 --> 00:23.013
- Tyler is not who you think he is.
- Who is he, then?

00:23.056 --> 00:24.751
He's your brother.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.821
I really need to see you tonight.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.521
I'm kind of busy right now.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.529
Thanks for not ditching me tonight.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.052
I could really use a friend.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.190
Well, you've got one.

00:33.233 --> 00:36.361
Hilda Suarez, I love you.
Will you marry me?

00:36.569 --> 00:37.763
Oh!

00:38.304 --> 00:41.398
- So, you like someone.
- Yeah.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.966
What is their name?

00:44.010 --> 00:45.238
Lily.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.274
I just got off the phone
with Lena Korvinka!

00:48.314 --> 00:51.909
She loved my audition and wants to
formally invite me to join her class!

00:54.054 --> 01:00.015
Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

01:00.393 --> 01:05.524
Deny thy father and refuse thy name...

01:08.101 --> 01:12.128
You see? Acting is reinvention.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.969
I mean, who is to say

01:14.007 --> 01:16.840
that Juliet has to be
the prettiest girl in the room?

01:16.876 --> 01:20.368
You know, maybe she's some
misguided boob with bad eyes

01:20.413 --> 01:23.905
and bad hair and bad teeth.

01:28.488 --> 01:31.480
- What?
- Okay, everybody take two minutes.

01:31.524 --> 01:35.358
I'm just gonna call my cat
and grab tonight's speaker.

01:35.862 --> 01:37.352
Am I too early to pick you up?

01:37.397 --> 01:39.194
Yeah, but you should stay
for the guest speaker.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.962
- He used to date a Gossip Girl.
- That's why he's speaking?

01:42.001 --> 01:45.698
- That's his qualification?
- That's all I need.

01:45.738 --> 01:48.400
Oh, Aunt Betty, this is my friend Austin.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.467
- Austin, hi.
- Hey.

01:51.511 --> 01:54.036
It's very nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.638
You tell her what a great actor I am?

01:55.682 --> 01:57.946
No, just what a giant ego you have.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.680
- And this is Lily.
- Hi. Cute glasses.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.847
Thanks. Nice to meet you.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.183
- That's the girl that I like.
Good news.

02:06.226 --> 02:09.491
Tinker Bell ate his dinner,
and he's going to be fine.

02:09.529 --> 02:14.933
All right, now, tonight's speaker
is an award-winning playwright

02:14.968 --> 02:18.267
and a foxy little muckety muck.

02:18.304 --> 02:22.468
<i>His latest play, The Rebirth of Rita,</i>

02:22.509 --> 02:24.238
opens next week.

02:24.277 --> 02:27.906
Please give a warm welcome
to Zachary Boule.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.216
I know him.

02:33.253 --> 02:37.883
I read his first play.
It was so good and so tragic.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.983
What a nice treat for me.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.960
Hey, everybody.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.319
Hi.

02:44.364 --> 02:47.492
So, Lena asked me
to speak about reinvention today,

02:47.534 --> 02:49.900
which is a theme in my next play.

02:50.803 --> 02:53.169
It was like he was talking directly to me.

02:53.206 --> 02:56.369
Everything he was saying
about reinventing yourself,

02:56.409 --> 02:58.343
your look, your life.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.278
Mmm. That's very interesting.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.782
I mean, that's everything
I've been doing this year.

03:03.816 --> 03:07.115
- My new look, my new job...
- You don't say.

03:07.153 --> 03:09.212
Hilda, stop.
I see your engagement ring, okay?

03:09.255 --> 03:10.882
Congratulations.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.017
Good, because I'm practicing
how to show it off

03:13.059 --> 03:15.755
without looking like I'm showing it off.

03:15.795 --> 03:19.526
- Do my hands look dry?
- Too obvious.

03:19.566 --> 03:23.024
As I was saying,
Zach was really inspiring.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.594
And by "inspiring," do you mean cute?

03:25.638 --> 03:26.866
- No.
- Yes, you do.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.704
That is not even what I was thinking.

03:29.742 --> 03:32.768
I mean, not that it would matter.
He dates Gossip Girls.

03:32.812 --> 03:36.407
And he won a Drama Desk Award.
I write a blog.

03:36.449 --> 03:37.643
I won a Blobby.

03:37.684 --> 03:41.085
<i>But I was thinking about pitching him
to Mode for the New York issue.</i>

03:41.120 --> 03:45.648
Yeah, you should.
Nothing says New York like theater.

03:45.692 --> 03:48.786
- Here, let me fix your hair.
- No. I see it.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.659
- You just scratched my glasses.
- That's because it's a diamond.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.906
- Hey. Your mom's on the phone.
- I don't want to talk to her.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.999
I can't keep telling her
you're in the bathroom.

04:03.042 --> 04:05.738
That's what you've been telling her
for four days?

04:05.778 --> 04:09.544
- Does she at least sound worried?
- Just talk to her.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.743
She waits 30 years
to tell me I have a brother.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.081
After she drops that bomb,

04:13.119 --> 04:15.417
she whisks him off to Paris
to meet Alexis.

04:15.455 --> 04:18.117
I think I'm entitled
to a little more time than that.

04:18.156 --> 04:21.820
- Think about how your brother feels.
- Don't call him my brother.

04:21.861 --> 04:25.024
- My only brother is my sister, Alexis.
- Exactly my point.

04:25.064 --> 04:28.431
The poor guy gets off a bus
from South Dakota, you punched him,

04:28.468 --> 04:32.495
and now he's whisked off
to meet Manzilla in some foreign land.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.870
Since when are you his friend?

04:34.907 --> 04:35.931
I'm not. I just...

04:37.110 --> 04:38.475
You know what? Forget it.
I have a lot of work

04:38.511 --> 04:39.535
I have to get back to.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.910
Daniel Meade's office.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.916
Now, Marc, I need all thoughts
of go-go boys in glitter pants

04:43.950 --> 04:45.247
out of your head today.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.809
James Cameron's people
are gonna call.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.481
They're doing the CGI work
to help me recreate old New York

04:49.522 --> 04:51.114
- for my cover shoot.
- Right. I should tell you

04:51.157 --> 04:54.718
- Daniel's concerned about the cost.
- I don't care about Daniel.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.558
You spend money to make money.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.521
Good morning.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.368
Was that monochromatic blur
Betty Suarez?

05:04.404 --> 05:09.000
I know. Where are the polka dots
and butterflies and Mexican blankets?

05:09.742 --> 05:10.800
Yeah.

05:10.843 --> 05:14.745
- Does she look nice?
- Willie,

05:15.248 --> 05:20.481
you swore you'd die before you ever
complimented a Suarez ensemble.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.017
- Oh, my God.
Willie!

05:24.057 --> 05:26.150
- What happened?
- Isn't it obvious?

05:26.192 --> 05:29.093
Your stumble into good taste
has killed her.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.064
By now you've all heard
what happened to Wilhelmina.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.692
She is having surgery
on a perforated ulcer,

05:34.734 --> 05:36.861
but she is going to live.

05:36.903 --> 05:40.430
The good news is I am taking point
on the New York issue.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.998
So I guess
we should send flowers or something.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.738
I guess $40 should about cover it,
don't you think?

05:45.778 --> 05:48.474
<i>It's just like you to cheap out, Daniel.</i>

05:48.514 --> 05:50.641
<i>- What the hell are you...
- I have a little time before surgery,</i>

05:50.683 --> 05:52.480
<i>so I'm gonna run this meeting,
thank you.</i>

05:52.518 --> 05:54.748
Do you really think that's the best idea?

05:54.787 --> 05:56.721
<i>Daniel, I could die on the table.</i>

05:56.756 --> 05:58.417
<i>Are you really gonna
take this away from me?</i>

05:58.458 --> 06:01.325
<i>- I thought it was a routine...
- Features, what do you got for me?</i>

06:01.861 --> 06:04.728
Hi, Wilhelmina, it's Betty.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.858
I've been thinking
about the idea of reinvention

06:07.900 --> 06:10.698
and how people
come to New York City to...

06:12.138 --> 06:14.868
<i>- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- I'm fine.</i>

06:14.907 --> 06:17.068
<i>It's your pitch. It's excruciating.</i>

06:17.110 --> 06:21.240
<i>- Just give her a chance.
- Fine. Five words. Go.</i>

06:21.848 --> 06:22.872
Um...

06:25.251 --> 06:26.548
Profile.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.247
Um...

06:28.554 --> 06:30.283
Playwright.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.257
<i>- Reinvention.
- No.</i>

06:32.291 --> 06:35.590
<i>I gave you five words.
You chose to use "um" twice.</i>

06:35.628 --> 06:39.325
<i>No playwrights.
Theater is dead, and so is your pitch.</i>

06:40.133 --> 06:42.124
<i>I am not wearing that.</i>

06:44.504 --> 06:47.996
<i>Apparently my table is ready,
so I will leave you with this.</i>

06:48.040 --> 06:51.601
<i>I've given Marc detailed instructions
as to how to proceed</i>

06:51.644 --> 06:53.475
<i>with my New Amsterdam shoot.</i>

06:53.513 --> 06:56.710
Wilhelmina, that's too expensive.
I told you we are not doing that.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.273
<i>Daniel, you stupid...</i>

07:00.653 --> 07:02.985
All right, that shoot is canceled.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.117
Daniel, can I please
re-pitch you my idea?

07:06.159 --> 07:09.026
Look, I hate to say it, but I have
to agree with Wilhelmina on this one.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.461
I don't see how it fits
in a fashion magazine.

07:11.497 --> 07:14.295
It does. Look at how fashionable he is.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.824
Besides, his new play
is all about reinvention,

07:16.869 --> 07:18.359
which is the core of fashion, right?

07:18.404 --> 07:20.804
I mean,
what's out yesterday is in tomorrow.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.537
And I'm sorry, but New York is theater.
I don't care what Wilhelmina says.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.444
- Is he with Leighton Meester?
- They're not together anymore.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.277
Wow, you said that fast.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.715
You know what? If you want
to ask him out, just ask him out.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.946
- You don't have to do a story on him.
- What?

07:33.986 --> 07:37.251
No, that has nothing to do with it.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.623
I just think that this would be
a really good story.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.555
Run with it. At the very least,
it will piss off Wilhelmina.

07:44.597 --> 07:49.364
Thank you. And trust me,
this is totally professional.

07:52.438 --> 07:56.499
- Your real name is Ezra Butinsky?
- Why would I make that up?

07:56.542 --> 08:01.172
I guess it doesn't have quite the same
romantic ring as "Zachary Boule. "

08:01.214 --> 08:05.275
So you think my name's romantic?
Is this interview taking a turn?

08:07.320 --> 08:10.619
Sorry, I interrupted you before.
What was your question?

08:10.656 --> 08:14.922
Right, 'cause I was
asking you a question.

08:15.361 --> 08:19.764
How has your time at Oxford
influenced your new play,

08:19.799 --> 08:21.596
<i>The Rebirth of Rita?</i>

08:22.301 --> 08:26.704
Off the record, I kind of embellished
my bio to sound more interesting.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.264
- Oh.
- I did one summer program there.

08:29.308 --> 08:32.106
The truth is I grew up in New Jersey.

08:32.144 --> 08:35.010
Typical dork, glasses and braces.

08:35.481 --> 08:39.144
Not that I'm implying that glasses
and braces make you a dork.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.211
- It's just... I mean, I still...
- It's okay, I can handle "dork. "

08:42.255 --> 08:44.155
I'm supposed to be
getting them off soon anyway.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.557
I just have to find a new orthodontist
because my old one went crazy on me.

08:47.593 --> 08:50.619
I love mine.
I can get you the info, if you want.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.426
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Although,

08:52.465 --> 08:54.592
somehow those work for you.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.896
Thanks.

08:56.636 --> 09:01.835
Okay, so, what about writing
do you enjoy the most?

09:01.874 --> 09:06.072
I'm kind of an over-thinker,
so I like to create impulsive characters.

09:06.112 --> 09:09.707
You know, the kind that get swept up
in a moment and take action.

09:09.749 --> 09:13.776
- That sounds liberating.
- Doesn't it?

09:13.819 --> 09:15.787
I mean, wouldn't our lives be
so much more interesting

09:15.821 --> 09:18.016
if we didn't think
everything through first?

09:18.057 --> 09:20.582
- Totally.
- Lf we just lived in the moment.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.992
We want something, we go for it.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:52.024 --> 09:54.185
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.921
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

09:55.962 --> 10:00.228
It's totally unprofessional
and disrespectful to you

10:00.266 --> 10:03.997
and whatever potential starlet girlfriend
you might have.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.731
I'm sorry.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.671
Look, I can assure you
that this will in no way

10:07.707 --> 10:10.835
negatively affect the piece
that I am writing on you. Sorry.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.777
- Good, you're still here.
- Hey, you.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.373
Sorry to bother.
I know you probably have

10:17.416 --> 10:21.182
- some big, fabulous date or something.
- You're sweet.

10:21.687 --> 10:24.383
But no, and now you've made me sad.

10:25.591 --> 10:26.956
What's up?

10:26.993 --> 10:29.860
My acting class is doing a scene night
for family and friends,

10:29.895 --> 10:31.726
- and I wanted to invite you.
- Oh.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.059
A night of scenes
performed by teenagers.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.730
How fun. How many scenes are there?

10:38.771 --> 10:41.035
- Twelve.
- And what number are you in the order?

10:41.073 --> 10:43.371
- Ten.
- Are any of these kids famous?

10:43.409 --> 10:46.276
One girl did a PSA for lead paint
when she was four.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.041
She had to chew a windowsill.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.104
Oh.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.206
It's Lily, the girl that I like.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.649
Right. So... So...

10:52.685 --> 10:56.815
- That's still happening?
- Yeah, it's great.

10:56.856 --> 11:01.793
- My friend Austin likes her, too.
- Okay, so, you both like her.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.055
Mmm-hmm.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.523
Well, count me in. I love drama.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.961
And I like theater.

11:13.406 --> 11:17.137
<i>Zachary Boule is one of
Broadway's brightest rising stars.</i>

11:17.443 --> 11:21.971
<i>In fact, I'd say the only thing brighter
is his dashing smile.</i>

11:22.014 --> 11:23.675
<i>Dashing smile?</i>

11:23.716 --> 11:25.149
<i>Keep it clean, Suarez.</i>

11:27.420 --> 11:30.412
<i>We met at a bar on 29th Street.</i>

11:30.456 --> 11:32.481
<i>His handshake was firm.</i>

11:32.525 --> 11:36.962
<i>I couldn't help but imagine those
same hands massaging my shoulders.</i>

11:40.900 --> 11:43.596
I need you to do something for me.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.404
Anything, Zach, anything at all.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.672
- I want to read my play to you.
- That's exactly what I hoped you'd say.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.840
"Page One. Act One. "

11:56.949 --> 11:58.473
That's amazing.

11:59.118 --> 12:03.987
"A spotlight illuminates
a well-worn easy chair, center stage. "

12:04.123 --> 12:06.353
An easy chair, that's so good.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.597
Wow, you're really in the zone, huh?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.436
Zone? Yes. I'm feeling the zone.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.598
- How was that thing last night?
- Thing?

12:22.007 --> 12:25.499
You mean my meeting with Zach?
Zachary. Zachary Boule.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.745
Good, but I wouldn't really
call it a "thing. "

12:27.780 --> 12:29.805
I'd call it an interview.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.347
Wow. You're being kind of weird.

12:33.385 --> 12:36.149
I'm not acting weird.
You're acting weird.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.317
- Hello?
- Zachary. How weird.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.187
Um...

12:43.562 --> 12:46.793
- Daniel, this is Zachary.
- It's nice to meet you.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.861
You have a really big fan here.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.632
Daniel, I'm not a fan.

12:52.671 --> 12:55.663
I'm not a fan. I'm an impartial journalist.
Can I help you with something?

12:55.708 --> 12:58.370
Just wanted to follow up
on our thing last night.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.435
Called it a "thing. "

13:00.479 --> 13:03.004
Well, let's go somewhere and talk.

13:06.886 --> 13:10.083
All we have to do is drop these caftans
and turbans off with Wilhelmina,

13:10.122 --> 13:12.647
the outfit of choice
for any recovering diva.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.750
Tyler just sent me a text.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.729
He wants to have dinner with me
when he gets back from Paris.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.425
I can't decide if it's weird or hot

13:20.466 --> 13:23.765
that you're sleeping with one brother
and secretly befriending the other.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.966
I can't, either. On one hand,
I've known Daniel for years

13:27.006 --> 13:28.564
and I really care about him,

13:28.607 --> 13:32.543
but on the other hand, Tyler's a model,
so it's kind of even, right?

13:33.245 --> 13:34.473
Dilemmas.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.242
<i>Dr. Vine to proctology.</i>

13:36.282 --> 13:38.250
<i>Dr. Vine to proctology.</i>

13:40.653 --> 13:42.780
Sweet, she's napping.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.222
I want to pull back the covers
and look at her body while she sleeps.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.952
No, no, no, no.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.722
Let's just drop this stuff off,
go have a nice lunch.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.697
- I was thinking soup and half a salad.
- Okay.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.593
Really, Marc? Soup and half a salad?

13:58.637 --> 14:02.004
When the cat's away, the mice
will gorge themselves to death.

14:02.041 --> 14:06.501
Oh, my God.
Willie, you're in a semi-private room.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.069
This is all they had available.

14:08.113 --> 14:12.914
Lucky for me, she gets no visitors.
Just slowly rotting away.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.879
Oh, sad face.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.589
Well, you're looking awfully spry

14:17.623 --> 14:20.183
for someone who's recovering
from a perforated ulcer.

14:20.226 --> 14:21.853
Well, I have to stay alert

14:21.894 --> 14:25.352
to go over the final details
for our New Amsterdam shoot.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.523
Oh.

14:26.565 --> 14:30.797
Did you not remember
that Daniel killed that yesterday?

14:30.836 --> 14:33.396
Of course, I remembered,
and I'm reviving it.

14:33.439 --> 14:37.341
So we'll work from here.
And don't you dare tell Daniel.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.077
If you're hungry,
call down for some ice chips.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.245
I'm sorry that you had to come
all the way down here.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.116
Well, the way
we ended things last night...

14:48.153 --> 14:52.522
I know, Zach. I'm sorry.
I am so embarrassed.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.891
I wish I could take everything back.
I mean, I'm a journalist.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.419
I should be able to maintain
a certain level of...

15:04.270 --> 15:07.569
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- I would love to.

15:09.308 --> 15:14.575
No. No, I can't.
I pushed really hard to write this article,

15:14.813 --> 15:17.873
and if my boss found out
that you and I...

15:17.917 --> 15:20.715
That we're involved,
that would look really bad.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.155
So, then we won't tell him.

15:25.190 --> 15:28.956
If anyone found out...
Zach, you're in the tabloids.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.428
You date two actresses
and crash a motorcycle

15:31.463 --> 15:34.364
and suddenly everyone wants
to take your picture.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.233
We can keep it a secret,
just between us.

15:38.037 --> 15:41.803
I've gotten pretty good at avoiding
the paparazzi when I have to.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.670
Okay, yes. A secret date.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.508
A secret date.

16:05.197 --> 16:09.361
Even through a morphine haze, I can
see the shoddy work on these samples.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.426
Have new ones sent over immediately.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.496
And call the waitress,
I need more Jell-O.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.804
- Wilhelmina.
- Speaking of Jell-O.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.777
I just tried to book Lorenzo for
the cover shoot we're actually doing,

16:19.812 --> 16:22.804
and I find out that he's already been
booked for your New Amsterdam shoot,

16:22.848 --> 16:24.748
the one we're not doing.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.013
It's not gonna work this time.

16:28.053 --> 16:31.147
Look, you can come up with something
more manageable for the next cover,

16:31.190 --> 16:34.159
but this one is mine. Let it go.

16:34.193 --> 16:38.493
Screw you
and your crappy gerbera daisies.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.964
- Fine, you win.
- Thank you.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.932
Well, I guess that's that.
I'll just take these down.

16:46.972 --> 16:50.237
You heard Daniel. I get the next cover,

16:50.409 --> 16:52.274
so park your ass down.

16:52.311 --> 16:55.610
Jockstrap Night at Boy Bar
doesn't start until 10:00.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.274
Get out of my head, woman.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.215
Okay, there's a chance
this movie might stink,

17:03.255 --> 17:06.747
but it's starring Bruce Willis,
so the theater will probably be empty.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.228
Well, in that case, I better do this now.

17:10.262 --> 17:13.095
Marc, you have to escape.
Hide.

17:13.132 --> 17:16.761
I am not going to Jockstrap Night alone.
I will look like a fool.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.702
Hey, Betty.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.295
Yeah, she's hanging out
in the lobby again.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.967
I know, weird, it's not even Saturday.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.704
I'm sorry.
I work with her and she's such a gossip,

17:25.743 --> 17:27.540
so let's just wait five minutes and...

17:27.579 --> 17:30.377
I didn't bring my wallet because
I knew you were gonna be there.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.077
Yeah, she's still here.

17:32.117 --> 17:35.018
I don't know, she seems happy.
I don't ask.

17:35.821 --> 17:38.517
Again, I'm sorry. Let's just dash out
before she comes back.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.048
Fine, I'll find some other queen
to buy me a drink.

17:41.093 --> 17:45.962
Oh, my God,
Betty met someone in the lobby.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.196
You should totally start
hanging out here.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.599
Why would that make you sad?

17:51.670 --> 17:53.661
Okay, hopefully, she's not coming back.

17:53.705 --> 17:56.173
I think we're safer back here.

18:02.514 --> 18:06.075
All right, here are
all the bridal issues I could find.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.586
Okay, so, tell me,

18:08.620 --> 18:14.559
does this say "engagement party"
or "dead hooker under a bridge"?

18:14.827 --> 18:17.489
Does she have to be a dead hooker?
Could she just be a live hooker?

18:17.529 --> 18:19.497
Can you just answer me?

18:19.531 --> 18:22.364
Bobby's cousin is coming over,
and she's a hooker.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.131
I don't want her to think
I'm making fun, you know.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.865
Then keep looking.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.933
Aw.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.742
Oh, let me guess.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.903
We're taking the PATH train out
to New Jersey tonight

18:33.946 --> 18:36.312
to go to this out-of-the-way
Argentinean restaurant.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.816
- That's cute, right?
- That is cute.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.786
I still can't believe he's actually into me.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.584
Why? Because he's
an award-winning playwright?

18:44.623 --> 18:48.559
Listen. You wrote a play, too.
Second grade.

18:48.594 --> 18:52.360
<i>You remember?
The Bumblebee That Needed Glasses.</i>

18:54.600 --> 18:56.090
That thing broke my heart.

18:57.236 --> 19:01.297
Anyway, the point is, you are worth it.
Believe it now.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.202
Your child is calling. Hi, Justin.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.170
Hi, sweetie.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.305
Mom, where the hell
are the cloth napkins?

19:09.348 --> 19:11.213
Whoa, what's with the word "hell"?

19:11.250 --> 19:13.081
Well, Lily's coming over
to watch a movie,

19:13.118 --> 19:14.847
and it's our first time alone.

19:14.887 --> 19:18.448
I can't very well serve her popcorn
with paper towels, can I?

19:18.490 --> 19:20.219
Well, actually, you can, but...

19:21.894 --> 19:25.227
Oh, God. She's here. Forget it.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.829
Oh, hell.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.138
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:39.711 --> 19:40.939
Oh.

19:40.979 --> 19:42.071
Hey.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.672
Hey, where's your TV?
I'll set up the movie.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.239
It's in there.

19:46.385 --> 19:49.252
She invited me.
I guess she wanted me here, too.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.916
Or maybe she felt sorry for you
'cause you were left out.

19:51.957 --> 19:56.053
- Or maybe she likes me better.
- Or maybe you need a breath mint.

19:56.094 --> 19:59.791
<i>Guys, which Romeo and Juliet?
Zeffirelli or Luhrmann?</i>

19:59.831 --> 20:01.628
Luhrmann.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.202
Welcome.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.505
Everyone.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.867
You know, I have to admit,

20:11.910 --> 20:14.743
all this sneaking around
has been kind of fun.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.341
Yeah. I almost forgot.

20:18.383 --> 20:22.149
- My orthodontist's card.
- Cute.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.159
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:47.312 --> 20:50.748
Daniel, I know what this looks like,
but I can explain.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.875
I think I can put two and two together.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.682
You begged me to let you do a story
on a hot, new playwright.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.951
I finally agreed to an objective profile,

20:57.990 --> 21:00.185
and now I discover
you're actually dating him.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.453
In my defense...

21:02.327 --> 21:03.419
I have no defense.

21:03.462 --> 21:07.262
I don't even know what to say to you.
You could lose your journalism license.

21:07.299 --> 21:10.097
Oh, no. My journalism license?

21:12.537 --> 21:13.731
What?

21:14.473 --> 21:15.770
Daniel.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.104
You are so cute when you're mortified.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.043
You have no idea
how stressed out I've been

21:20.078 --> 21:21.943
trying to keep this a secret from you.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.880
You're actually worried what I think?

21:23.915 --> 21:27.976
Betty, I'm here because
I'm fooling around with my assistant.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.544
So, my point was,

21:29.588 --> 21:31.681
I'm not one
to pass judgment on anyone.

21:31.723 --> 21:34.055
Just give me a little heads up next time.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.462
I think I'm gonna say no
to dinner with Tyler.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.126
I've got this thing with Daniel,

21:42.167 --> 21:45.159
and aren't there state laws against
going from one brother to another?

21:45.203 --> 21:48.036
Probably in Texas. You're not
allowed to do anything there.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.200
Maybe I'll just have coffee with Tyler.

21:50.242 --> 21:53.905
He's so nice, and I think
I'm a little bit smarter than he is.

21:53.945 --> 21:56.607
- You have no idea how good that feels.
- I do.

21:56.648 --> 22:01.244
Mandy, look. What you have
with Daniel is casual and fun,

22:01.286 --> 22:04.312
but with Tyler,
you don't know what that is.

22:04.356 --> 22:06.688
So you have to ask yourself,
are you happy with what you've got,

22:06.725 --> 22:10.593
or do you want the possibility
of something more?

22:11.797 --> 22:14.891
- No, not you two.
- Excuse me?

22:14.933 --> 22:16.798
I'm Wilhelmina Slater's doctor,

22:16.835 --> 22:20.271
and I can't have you two
bringing her any more work.

22:20.305 --> 22:22.364
If she doesn't get some rest,
she'll never heal.

22:22.407 --> 22:25.137
But Dr. So-and-so,
we don't have the power to stop her.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.508
Try.

22:26.545 --> 22:30.208
Otherwise, you'll be visiting her here
for a very long time.

22:31.917 --> 22:36.411
- What are we supposed to do? Kill her?
- We can't. She'll only grow stronger.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.617
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.891
- Where the hell have you been?
- We got held up by Dr. Who's-it.

22:45.263 --> 22:48.232
- He's really worried about you.
- That fool.

22:48.266 --> 22:51.724
He couldn't find his ass with
both hands if I spotted him a cheek.

22:51.770 --> 22:55.433
- So, let's get to work.
- Okay, well, here's this.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.372
Distract her.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.846
Excuse me, Wilhelmina.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.849
I have a very important question
to ask you.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.516
Yes?

23:10.422 --> 23:14.415
Which of these is the Cabbage Patch
and which is the Prep? A?

23:18.430 --> 23:19.692
Or B?

23:24.169 --> 23:27.229
What is she doing?
And what are you doing?

23:27.272 --> 23:29.502
- I'm saving you from yourself.
- You idiot.

23:29.541 --> 23:33.204
When I wake up, I swear to God,
I'm gonna hunt you down and...

23:34.913 --> 23:36.437
...and hug you.

23:49.361 --> 23:52.694
I forgot she always does that
when she first falls asleep.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.096
- Mandy?
- I peed a little.

23:54.132 --> 23:55.463
It's okay.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.198
I won't tell anyone.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.870
Hey. Got your message.

24:00.906 --> 24:03.466
I was surprised
you wanted to meet me here.

24:03.508 --> 24:05.738
I wanted to show you something.

24:12.384 --> 24:15.785
Betty, what are you doing?
People can see us.

24:15.821 --> 24:18.346
I know. We don't have to hide anymore.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.826
But what about
all the code of ethics stuff?

24:21.860 --> 24:24.954
I was taking it too seriously.
I can do that.

24:24.996 --> 24:29.296
So, I was thinking, maybe I could be
your date to the premiere tonight?

24:30.001 --> 24:31.491
I would love that.

24:31.536 --> 24:34.801
But let me just call my mom first
and cancel.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.400
- Wait, you were gonna take your mom?
- I know, I'm lame,

24:37.442 --> 24:40.104
but she kind of lives for
every opportunity to come into the city

24:40.145 --> 24:42.511
- and see a celebrity.
- That's not lame. That's sweet.

24:42.547 --> 24:44.276
No, stop, stop. You can't cancel on her.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.876
Why not? I'd rather go with you.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.352
That's also very sweet,
but you should take your mom.

24:49.387 --> 24:51.116
I can go later in the week.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.350
- You sure?
- Yes.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.257
- Now, go. You have to get ready.
- Okay.

24:59.297 --> 25:00.594
Break a leg.

25:03.268 --> 25:05.828
Okay, well,
this hair isn't getting any better.

25:05.871 --> 25:07.395
Let's just go.

25:12.611 --> 25:14.044
What's wrong?

25:14.679 --> 25:16.169
Why are we sitting?

25:17.115 --> 25:21.313
I'm freaking out.
I have to kiss Lily in our scene tonight.

25:23.054 --> 25:24.078
Oh.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.658
You have to kiss Lily?

25:27.692 --> 25:30.388
But I thought you liked this girl, right?

25:31.029 --> 25:33.361
- Isn't this a good thing?
- Yeah.

25:34.032 --> 25:39.163
We've just never rehearsed it,
and our first kiss is gonna be on stage.

25:39.204 --> 25:42.196
What if she thinks that I'm bad?

25:43.608 --> 25:45.007
Okay, well,

25:46.411 --> 25:49.812
if you think about it,
you're in a pretty good place.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.510
You actually like
the girl you have to kiss,

25:54.319 --> 25:58.915
so just let your feelings take over

26:01.393 --> 26:04.760
and you won't be bad.

26:07.198 --> 26:11.157
If you kiss someone with feeling,

26:13.305 --> 26:14.499
they know it.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.067
And you know it.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.536
It's like everything else goes gray,

26:25.517 --> 26:29.078
and you're the only two people
left in the whole world.

26:30.455 --> 26:31.820
Thanks.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.354
I feel better now.

26:35.660 --> 26:36.820
Good.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.957
I've never felt more alone.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.397
Off we go.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.267
Excuse me.

26:51.509 --> 26:52.874
Sorry.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.105
Did I hit you? I'm sorry.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.613
Those for one of the actors?

26:59.651 --> 27:02.552
For the playwright.
We're seeing each other.

27:02.587 --> 27:05.886
- Zachary Boule? Really?
- Really.

27:07.058 --> 27:10.653
I mean, I was supposed to sit with him,
but he's bringing his mother instead.

27:10.695 --> 27:13.357
And I couldn't just not come,
so I used my press pass.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.866
Actually, I thought I'd get a better seat.

27:16.568 --> 27:19.128
Not that these are bad seats.
These are great seats.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.968
Let's just hope the play is
as good as that story.

27:27.579 --> 27:29.206
There he is.

27:31.683 --> 27:34.151
Zach. Zach.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.151
Hi. I made it.

27:56.541 --> 28:01.001
I know this is gonna sound insensitive,
but you're gonna sit down, right?

28:01.746 --> 28:02.906
No.

28:03.748 --> 28:06.080
I have to go. Excuse me. Sorry.

28:06.685 --> 28:11.054
Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

28:11.489 --> 28:15.391
Mama? Mama, where are you?
I can't see you.

28:15.727 --> 28:17.354
I'm here, Rita.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.259
I had some trouble getting back here
through the fog.

28:23.601 --> 28:26.832
Run on down and help me with this dirt.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.030
Is Daddy with you?

28:29.074 --> 28:31.975
- He's held up by Mr. Roker...
Sorry. I didn't mean...

28:32.010 --> 28:33.875
...and his mare's working
through a fever.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.243
He'll be back in a bit.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.304
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.474
How was I supposed to know
she was gonna come down the aisle?

28:40.518 --> 28:41.678
That's so cliché.

28:41.786 --> 28:44.084
This isn't what
I thought it would be.

28:44.656 --> 28:47.420
- Then what are you saying?
- Tell him, Beatrice.

28:47.992 --> 28:49.755
I'm saying goodbye.

28:52.263 --> 28:54.629
That's not how you say goodbye.

28:55.433 --> 28:58.891
- Oh, my God. I think this is it.
- What? This is what?

29:01.506 --> 29:02.905
Oh, my.

29:25.029 --> 29:26.792
Terrific. That was terrific.

29:26.831 --> 29:29.698
A little better in rehearsal,
but that was good.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.437
Oh, dear God,
would you please knock it off?

29:44.149 --> 29:47.346
I'm sorry. I assumed
by the zombie-like complexion

29:47.385 --> 29:50.479
and the occasional death rattle,
you wouldn't mind.

29:50.522 --> 29:51.546
Ouch.

29:52.724 --> 29:56.592
Save it for those poor kids
you torture all day.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.828
Those kids are my employees.

30:00.865 --> 30:03.493
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
I have a business to run.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.560
I understand.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.537
I used to be you.

30:08.339 --> 30:11.399
You know, I'm gonna call the nurse.
You're clearly having a stroke.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.501
You're a high-strung, type-A bitch

30:13.545 --> 30:16.742
who doesn't give a damn
about anything but her career.

30:16.781 --> 30:19.341
You see, this is why
I wanted a private room.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.682
Now, let me tell you something.

30:21.719 --> 30:23.880
You're getting old.

30:24.255 --> 30:25.882
You heard me.

30:25.924 --> 30:28.188
You can paralyze your whole face.

30:28.226 --> 30:30.820
You can lift your boobs,
your butt and your neck

30:30.862 --> 30:35.458
until you're six inches off the ground,
but you can't stop time.

30:36.234 --> 30:39.726
One day, your precious job
is gonna be done with you

30:40.038 --> 30:43.439
and all you're gonna be left with
is a bunch of missed holidays,

30:43.474 --> 30:45.135
skipped vacations,

30:47.345 --> 30:51.543
and a son you haven't seen in 20 years.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.780
Hell, I might be a grandmother
and not even know it,

30:56.254 --> 30:58.848
but I got stock options

31:00.391 --> 31:03.849
and a bunch of toys
I can't even play with.

31:12.770 --> 31:15.238
Thank you so much for coming,
but I need to find my friends.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.797
Okay, well, I love you.

31:16.841 --> 31:19.708
Have a good time at the cast party
and stay as long as you want,

31:19.744 --> 31:22.542
- but take a cab and be home by 11:00.
Okay.

31:23.081 --> 31:26.209
By the way,
that thing you were worried about,

31:26.251 --> 31:28.515
- totally sold it.
- Thanks.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.585
Betty. Betty. I'm sorry.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.718
No, I'm sorry. It must have been so hard

32:09.761 --> 32:11.752
to grow up with a mother
who was younger than you.

32:11.796 --> 32:13.525
- Good luck with the play.
- It wasn't my idea.

32:13.564 --> 32:15.794
My agent and manager
set up the whole thing.

32:15.833 --> 32:17.562
You think all this would have happened

32:17.602 --> 32:19.968
to Ezra Butinsky,
nerd writer from Jersey?

32:20.004 --> 32:22.973
Yes, because Ezra is talented.

32:23.007 --> 32:24.941
Yeah, well, Ezra didn't have
any of his plays produced

32:24.976 --> 32:26.944
until he changed his name
to Zachary Boule

32:26.978 --> 32:28.775
and got a $500 haircut.

32:28.813 --> 32:31.782
Well, I'm glad that worked out for you,
but I'd like to go.

32:31.816 --> 32:33.647
Come on.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.414
I have a reputation.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.482
That involves being seen
with hot girls on your arm?

32:38.523 --> 32:41.788
Exactly. They get me press
and that fills the seats,

32:41.826 --> 32:44.488
but it doesn't mean we can't go out.

32:44.529 --> 32:47.498
- Just that no one can know about it.
- For now.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.335
Come on. I like you, Betty.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.235
Just wait for me after the show.

32:54.272 --> 32:57.673
Don't think about it. Be impulsive.

32:58.276 --> 33:01.268
Just do what you want to do.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.692
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought we were gonna hang out.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.893
You guys go without me.

33:22.934 --> 33:25.562
Justin, I know you saw us.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.802
Don't worry, she didn't pick me
over you or anything.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.640
I kissed her. You got to do it on stage,
so I wanted my shot, too.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.043
Well, she seemed pretty into it.

33:36.581 --> 33:37.912
I guess.

33:39.384 --> 33:40.817
You weren't?

33:41.085 --> 33:44.054
Well, it wasn't like you two on stage.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.220
That seemed intense.

33:46.657 --> 33:50.718
Yeah, well, I guess
it's just because I'm a good actor.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.925
Really?

33:54.732 --> 33:56.165
Yeah.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.327
It was better in my head.

34:02.006 --> 34:04.474
This is messed up, all right? Like...

34:04.509 --> 34:08.342
And by the way,
you weren't that good, all right?

34:08.379 --> 34:09.902
'Cause I had to move
all the way over here

34:09.947 --> 34:12.245
'cause you were totally blocking me
when you kissed her.

34:12.283 --> 34:14.774
You wish. I definitely did it right.

34:14.819 --> 34:17.083
You just have to have
everyone seeing you all the time.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.315
Trust me,
they were looking at me anyway.

34:19.357 --> 34:22.815
- You are so in love with yourself.
- Wouldn't you be?

34:38.976 --> 34:40.375
I'm sorry.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.829
No.
Isn't that dress tacky?

35:00.865 --> 35:03.732
Oy. I wouldn't even wear that.
I wouldn't even wear this.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.827
That dress is a no.

35:08.473 --> 35:11.271
- Hey, I'm home.
- Justin!

35:11.309 --> 35:13.368
- There's my star.
- Hey.

35:13.578 --> 35:14.670
Oh, my God.

35:14.712 --> 35:16.680
You're not gonna believe
what your Aunt Betty did.

35:16.714 --> 35:19.308
She punched that guy Zachary
at his premiere.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.250
Look, it's already on the Internet.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.545
Wow. That's crazy.

35:23.588 --> 35:26.819
I'm not proud of it,
but it did feel really good.

35:28.159 --> 35:30.389
Okay, well, good night.

35:30.428 --> 35:34.455
Hey, why are you rushing off to bed?
And why are you home so early?

35:34.499 --> 35:37.161
I thought you were gonna hang out
with Lily and what's-his-name.

35:37.735 --> 35:40.829
Austin. Yeah, I was.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.172
I'm just not feeling that great.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.377
I don't think I'm gonna go
to acting class tomorrow.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.674
Really?

35:52.283 --> 35:55.252
Must just be the excitement
from the night, huh?

35:55.553 --> 35:57.783
Yeah. Maybe.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.892
Man, teenagers and their mood swings.

36:06.931 --> 36:09.491
One minute he's up,
and the next minute...

36:12.236 --> 36:14.864
God, what's wrong with you?

36:17.875 --> 36:20.844
This whole time
I thought I was hiding him,

36:22.346 --> 36:24.246
and he was hiding me.

36:24.515 --> 36:28.611
And the worst part is, on some level,
I knew how this was gonna end.

36:28.653 --> 36:30.348
Come on, come on.

36:30.388 --> 36:32.822
You can't turn this
into something that it's not.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.222
It's true.

36:34.258 --> 36:36.249
Every time I feel like
I'm moving forward,

36:36.294 --> 36:37.989
someone reminds me that

36:38.963 --> 36:42.490
I'm still just the dork
with glasses and braces.

36:43.067 --> 36:46.298
Yeah, but those braces are coming off
any day now.

36:46.337 --> 36:48.897
Yeah, but what if nothing changes?

36:50.741 --> 36:54.142
- Then I'll have nothing to blame.
- Honey,

36:55.313 --> 36:57.110
you've got to stop.

36:57.148 --> 36:59.742
Somehow, you got it in your head

37:00.184 --> 37:02.118
that this is your story.

37:03.454 --> 37:05.684
But you got to let that go.

37:05.723 --> 37:09.318
It's time to come up
with a whole new story for yourself.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.524
You are who you are,

37:12.463 --> 37:14.192
and the sooner that
you're okay with that,

37:14.232 --> 37:17.258
the sooner that you see what I see,

37:17.902 --> 37:20.029
the happier you're gonna be.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.062
I swear to God.

37:32.049 --> 37:33.346
Okay.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.277
Oh.

37:36.320 --> 37:39.619
- Hey, did you get my text?
- No.

37:40.625 --> 37:43.389
I've been kind of avoiding texts all day.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.988
Well, I finally talked to my mom.
We really got into it again.

37:47.031 --> 37:50.194
I am in such a bad mood.

37:50.835 --> 37:53.633
- I'm sorry, Daniel.
- Big plans?

37:54.538 --> 37:56.233
You know what?

37:56.274 --> 37:58.868
I'm not sure
I'm up for our kind of plans tonight.

37:59.744 --> 38:01.302
Okay.

38:02.513 --> 38:05.346
It's cool. You mind if I just hang out?

38:06.017 --> 38:09.145
I don't really feel like
being alone right now.

38:09.587 --> 38:10.645
Come on in.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.986
I'll grab a couple
of Marc's 64-calorie beers.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.049
- You want one?
- No, I'm good.

38:29.173 --> 38:30.697
You're late.

38:30.741 --> 38:33.471
Sorry, Willie. About yesterday...

38:33.511 --> 38:36.537
It's fine. Turns out you were right.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.443
It was good for me.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.340
- Really?
- Yes.

38:41.786 --> 38:44.050
I had an epiphany last night.

38:49.427 --> 38:50.894
That angel.

38:53.931 --> 38:56.798
That sweet, wheezing angel

38:56.834 --> 39:01.965
said something to me last night
that made me reevaluate my priorities.

39:04.141 --> 39:07.406
I'm wasting my life, Marc.
What am I doing?

39:07.778 --> 39:10.611
Working at a fashion magazine
day and night,

39:10.648 --> 39:12.741
and for what? A paycheck?

39:13.317 --> 39:16.753
A meager percentage
of some dwindling bottom line?

39:18.556 --> 39:20.421
I know what I want,

39:20.458 --> 39:22.153
<i>and it's not Mode.</i>

39:24.962 --> 39:26.395
It's not?

39:29.533 --> 39:31.125
It's Meade.

39:31.168 --> 39:32.965
I want the whole damn company.

39:33.003 --> 39:35.198
And this time,
I'm not gonna dance around Claire.

39:35.239 --> 39:38.731
No more compromising with Daniel.
No more Nice Willie.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.411
This has been Nice Willie?

39:41.445 --> 39:44.903
If I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die with the most toys.

39:50.621 --> 39:54.182
- Betty.
- Oh, no. Look at your face.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.783
It's okay, I deserved it.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.885
I came by to say thank you
for sending me the profile.

39:58.362 --> 40:00.887
It was surprisingly nice.
Kind of expected you to trash me.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.263
No, I would never do that.

40:03.300 --> 40:06.497
Aside from the occasional punching
and sneaking around,

40:06.537 --> 40:09.062
I like to keep it professional.

40:09.106 --> 40:10.937
I'm glad you liked the article.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.135
Betty.

40:13.844 --> 40:17.371
I really am sorry, and I really like you.

40:18.182 --> 40:20.776
And this might be
presumptuous of me to ask,

40:21.452 --> 40:24.853
but is there any chance
you might give me another shot?

40:25.756 --> 40:29.214
No. Thanks, but no.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.855
I think it's time for me
to try something different.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.694
But I'll see you around.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.005
- Hey.
Hi.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.839
- Have you seen Austin?
- No.

40:48.879 --> 40:50.073
I'm sorry I'm late.

40:50.114 --> 40:53.083
Some days,
it's just hard to get out of bed.

40:53.117 --> 40:56.917
You're actors, you'll see.
Okay, let's begin.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.623
- Yeah?
- Shouldn't we wait for Austin?

41:00.658 --> 41:03.718
Oh, no.
Austin will no longer be joining us.

41:03.761 --> 41:06.389
He dropped out of class this morning.

41:06.931 --> 41:12.961
Okay, so, today, we're gonna talk about
having a physical life on the stage.

41:35.059 --> 41:39.086
Hi, my name is Betty Suarez,
and I'm looking for a new orthodontist.

41:39.129 --> 41:42.826
I was wondering if Dr. Frankel is
taking any new patients.

41:44.201 --> 41:47.728
I've been wearing braces
for over four years now.

41:49.306 --> 41:53.242
Wednesday? That would be great.

41:54.305 --> 42:00.483
