00:00.834 --> 00:02.033
Hey, I'm Chuck.
Here's a couple of things

00:02.100 --> 00:03.233
you might need to know
or maybe you just forgot.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.334
I had a fiancÃ©e.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.601
<i>Now, she thinks I'm dead.</i>

00:05.667 --> 00:09.200
<i>Alex.
You got a daughter, Casey.</i>

00:09.267 --> 00:11.300
Do you think Ellie's happy
in your marriage? Of course.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.133
Why? Did she say something?

00:13.200 --> 00:14.500
This is about your
father, Ellie.

00:14.567 --> 00:15.934
There are some
very bad people

00:16.001 --> 00:17.300
looking for him,
including a man named

00:17.367 --> 00:18.567
<i>John Casey.</i>

00:20.068 --> 00:22.968
I knew it! You downloaded
the Intersect 2.0.

00:23.034 --> 00:25.634
The Intersect...
it can have a negative affect

00:25.701 --> 00:27.367
on the brain.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.034
Your dreams are
all proof of stress

00:29.100 --> 00:30.434
likely leading to serious

00:30.500 --> 00:32.334
<i>mental deterioration.</i>

00:32.400 --> 00:33.767
<i>So, what did you want</i>

00:33.834 --> 00:35.034
to tell me?
Is it about the doctor?

00:35.100 --> 00:38.934
He said that... I'm fine.

00:39.001 --> 00:40.634
Wait a minute,
you dreamt Shaw was alive?

00:40.701 --> 00:42.267
<i>Chuck, you saw him die.</i>

00:42.334 --> 00:44.534
I call it the Governor.

00:44.601 --> 00:45.901
It governs my neural network

00:45.968 --> 00:48.001
and helps control the
power of the Intersect.

00:48.068 --> 00:49.968
<i>Could something like that
work for the 2.0?</i>

00:50.034 --> 00:51.968
It will. I'm going
to make you one.

00:55.068 --> 00:57.467
So, how's everything, uh,
how's everything coming?

00:57.534 --> 00:59.267
Same as the last
time you asked me.

01:00.601 --> 01:02.567
Can I get you anything,
like a, like a juice?

01:02.634 --> 01:03.901
Or coffee?

01:03.968 --> 01:05.300
Maybe a breakfast sandwich?

01:05.367 --> 01:07.068
I'm fine, Charles.
Just relax.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.934
"Relax." That's good.

01:09.001 --> 01:10.467
That's... that's good.

01:10.534 --> 01:12.334
Dad, is this really
going to work?

01:12.400 --> 01:14.233
This whole,
this whole Governor thingy?

01:14.300 --> 01:16.001
I'm still alive, aren't I?

01:16.068 --> 01:17.767
Look, based on
the schematics

01:17.834 --> 01:19.867
of my own Governor,
I'm going to create

01:19.934 --> 01:21.001
a new one that'll
help control

01:21.068 --> 01:22.400
the Intersect 2.0 before...

01:22.467 --> 01:24.068
Before what?
Before I go nuts?

01:24.133 --> 01:25.667
Because that's exactly
what the Ring wants.

01:25.734 --> 01:27.367
Son, your brain is working fine

01:27.434 --> 01:29.068
so far, right?
Who wouldn't be

01:29.133 --> 01:31.001
paranoid in your shoes?
Your cover's blown,

01:31.068 --> 01:32.867
your secret base discovered,
your dead partner

01:32.934 --> 01:34.701
and girlfriend's ex-lover
was a double agent.

01:34.801 --> 01:36.100
Way to talk me down, Dad.

01:36.167 --> 01:38.934
What I, what I'm trying
to say is...

01:39.001 --> 01:41.534
Your courage makes me
very proud.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.734
But there's some battles

01:43.801 --> 01:45.867
you have to walk away from.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.400
What are you saying- run?

01:50.467 --> 01:51.801
Turn my back

01:51.867 --> 01:53.701
on everyone that I care about?

01:53.767 --> 01:57.200
There may come a time when
if you want to protect them...

01:58.667 --> 02:01.300
...you have to go.

02:01.367 --> 02:03.034
Go where?

02:03.100 --> 02:05.034
Vacation.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.734
Dad was just saying
that he thinks

02:06.801 --> 02:09.033
I might need to get out
of here and take a little break.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.800
Well, he's right. You've
been a little nervous lately.

02:10.866 --> 02:12.233
So, is this what you two

02:12.300 --> 02:13.634
have been working on?
Yeah.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.534
Little family heirloom
Dad's just

02:15.601 --> 02:16.701
sprucing up for me.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.834
Well, I'm su
he doesn't need you

02:18.901 --> 02:20.001
looking over his shoulder.

02:20.068 --> 02:21.300
You could use some fresh air.

02:21.367 --> 02:22.901
She's right, Charles.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.968
Smell the roses.
I'd really rather not, Dad.

02:25.034 --> 02:26.934
Seasonal allergies-
you know, runs in the family.

02:27.001 --> 02:28.100
Listen to the man.

02:28.167 --> 02:29.767
He knows what's
best for you.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.367
Need any help?

02:36.601 --> 02:38.634
Dude? You don't look
so hot, buddy.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.567
I mean, compared to your
normal level of hotness.

02:40.634 --> 02:41.968
Lost a little sizzle.

02:42.034 --> 02:43.267
I'm looking for my wife, Morgan.

02:43.334 --> 02:45.200
She didn't come
home last night.

02:45.267 --> 02:46.334
You don't say?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.767
I do say.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.934
Why would I know where Ellie is?

02:49.001 --> 02:50.001
Why'd you think there was

02:50.068 --> 02:51.068
something wrong
with our marriage?

02:51.133 --> 02:52.834
No reason.

02:52.901 --> 02:54.167
You know, I just kind of...

02:54.233 --> 02:55.267
Don't B.S. me, little man.

02:55.334 --> 02:56.968
If something is
up with Ellie,

02:57.034 --> 02:58.834
I want to know about it now.

02:58.901 --> 03:00.767
Oh, boy.

03:00.834 --> 03:02.701
She's having an affair.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.267
She's cheating
on you, bro.

03:04.334 --> 03:06.133
What? That's impossible.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.467
Casey intercepted an illicit

03:08.534 --> 03:09.901
phone message, and
he played it for me.

03:09.968 --> 03:11.200
What? Ellie would never...

03:11.267 --> 03:12.267
Devon...

03:12.334 --> 03:14.001
Whoa.
I'm sorry.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.634
You just called me "Devon."

03:15.701 --> 03:18.034
Yeah, well, this is
no time for frivolity.

03:20.001 --> 03:21.133
I really need to see you.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.300
Devon thinks that I'm

03:22.367 --> 03:23.534
at the hospital.
It's just, it's getting

03:23.601 --> 03:24.701
harder and harder to lie.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.500
I know.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.068
How could she do this to us?

03:32.233 --> 03:35.734
I need to call my wife.
Yeah.

03:35.801 --> 03:37.968
I gotta get in on
some of this Ellie action.

03:38.034 --> 03:41.334
That is why I choose
not to get married.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.734
That's why I ward them off.

03:48.634 --> 03:50.133
Hey, I need to
call my husband.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.567
It's weird,
I'm not getting a signal.

03:51.634 --> 03:53.133
It's blocked.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.300
We can't have enemy operatives

03:54.367 --> 03:55.534
like John Casey
tracking you here.

03:55.601 --> 03:56.667
He's on the loose?
I thought... He had

03:56.734 --> 03:58.634
fled by the time our team
got to your apartment.

03:58.701 --> 04:01.500
I have to call Chuck.
I have to protect him.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.034
Ellie...

04:03.100 --> 04:05.267
We're in the process of
bringing your brother in.

04:05.334 --> 04:07.567
You're safe here,
and John Casey knows better

04:07.634 --> 04:09.200
than to show his face
anytime soon.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.200
One apple pie

04:13.267 --> 04:14.601
and one cup of coffee.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.334
Black and bitter.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.000
Actually, I didn't order yet.

04:18.067 --> 04:19.834
I know. I ordered
for you. It's easy.

04:19.901 --> 04:21.166
You always get
the same thing.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.867
And you always sit in the
same seat facing the door.

04:23.934 --> 04:26.133
Creature of habit.
What can I say?

04:27.334 --> 04:30.034
What happened to your face?
Hmm?

04:30.100 --> 04:31.767
Kitchen accident.
It's nothing.

04:31.834 --> 04:33.634
Hey, how'd that, uh,

04:33.701 --> 04:36.034
criminal psych final
of yours go? Good.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.434
Piece of cake. I'm all set
to graduate next week.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.934
Oh. It's like your days
of slinging pie are numbered.

04:42.001 --> 04:43.334
Don't worry.
I'll make sure

04:43.400 --> 04:45.300
the next girl
gets your order right.

04:45.367 --> 04:48.133
You won't even miss me, John.

04:49.434 --> 04:51.601
Thanks, Alex.

04:55.267 --> 04:58.467
All of these people, any of
whom could be Ring agents.

04:58.534 --> 05:00.434
Oh, come on. You've got to
switch off your spy mode.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.100
You're going to drive
yourself crazy.

05:02.167 --> 05:04.034
Yeah, well, I've been down
that road before, haven't I?

05:04.100 --> 05:05.867
Well, the CIA shrink said

05:05.934 --> 05:08.667
that you have nothing to
worry about, remember? Right.

05:08.734 --> 05:10.734
Other than the Ring
trying to kill my father

05:10.801 --> 05:14.267
or me imaging that Shaw
is still out there and trying

05:14.334 --> 05:16.500
to kill me.
Look, your father is safe.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.267
And not only that, but
he is here with you,

05:18.334 --> 05:19.601
which is great.
And Shaw?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.467
Shaw is dead.

05:21.534 --> 05:23.434
Look, I know what
you went through,

05:23.500 --> 05:25.068
but you really have to
start putting it behind you.

05:25.133 --> 05:26.334
What if I can't?

05:26.400 --> 05:29.334
Mmm, then there is always
blueberries.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.434
How is this possibly
suppose to make...?

05:31.500 --> 05:32.734
Oh, my God, these are
amazing blueberries.

05:32.801 --> 05:35.334
Mm-hmm. Wait till you
try them with cream.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.734
Mm, be right back.

05:36.801 --> 05:38.100
What?

05:38.167 --> 05:40.467
Beautiful day, isn't it?

05:43.634 --> 05:44.968
<i>Beautiful day, isn't it?</i>

05:46.601 --> 05:48.300
Well, you have
a good one.

05:48.367 --> 05:50.767
Thank you.

05:54.068 --> 05:55.434
Oh, God...

06:01.001 --> 06:02.701
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

06:02.767 --> 06:04.133
Sorry.

06:09.601 --> 06:11.133

You're sure this isn't just another

07:41.067 --> 07:42.834
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I am sure.

07:42.901 --> 07:44.333
Okay, Shaw is alive.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.600
It was like he
was taunting me.

07:45.667 --> 07:46.801
We have to call Beckman.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.134
I already tried.
Her assistant said

07:48.201 --> 07:49.367
that she's "indisposed."

07:49.433 --> 07:50.567
"Indisposed"?

07:50.634 --> 07:51.801
What is that suppose to mean?

07:51.867 --> 07:53.934
Th-The guy that I killed
is back from the dead.

07:54.001 --> 07:55.667
A guy who, keep in mind,
is a Ring operative,

07:55.734 --> 07:57.767
who knows our covers, where
we live, where Castle is.

07:57.834 --> 08:00.934
What station did you see him in?
North Hollywood. Why?

08:02.234 --> 08:04.201
The time?
Maybe half an hour ago.

08:04.268 --> 08:05.268
North or southbound?

08:05.333 --> 08:06.467
South.

08:08.134 --> 08:09.433
Any of this look familiar?

08:09.500 --> 08:11.101
Are you kidding?
It's Bartowski running

08:11.168 --> 08:12.534
around like a chicken
with its head cut off.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.534
Slow it down.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.034
Punch in.

08:16.101 --> 08:17.634
Right there, Dad.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.168
Oh, my God. Daniel.

08:25.767 --> 08:28.400
Uh, do we know what
station he got off at?

08:28.467 --> 08:31.734
One sec. Let me run the
facial recognition software.

08:33.734 --> 08:34.933
Hollywood and Western.

08:36.201 --> 08:38.567
Bingo.
Where did he exit?

08:41.332 --> 08:43.268
There he is.

08:43.332 --> 08:44.901
What the hell is he doing?

08:44.967 --> 08:47.467
We need to follow Shaw
and take him down.

08:47.534 --> 08:49.600
Yeah, that's one way
of looking at it.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.734
The other option is, they're
leading you into a trap.

08:51.801 --> 08:53.101
It's not like
we're going in empty-handed.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.268
You know how I feel

08:56.333 --> 08:57.634
about this, Charles.
Yeah.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.268
Yeah, I do,
but I don't have a choice.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.700
That's exactly what
the Ring wants you to think.

09:00.767 --> 09:01.801
There's always

09:01.867 --> 09:04.433
a choice.
What choice would that be, Dad?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.234
To run away?
I'm not you, okay?

09:06.300 --> 09:08.367
I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life in hiding.

09:08.433 --> 09:11.134
I can't leave the
ones I love behind.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.634
Let's go.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.134
* *

09:24.700 --> 09:26.600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you...?

09:27.667 --> 09:29.433
...doing here, man?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.101
My life is over.

09:31.168 --> 09:33.500
My wife has given herself
to another man.

09:33.567 --> 09:34.534
Hey, your wife has

09:34.600 --> 09:36.134
given you a pass.

09:36.234 --> 09:37.500
You're now free
to go out and mount

09:37.567 --> 09:38.500
whomever you want wish to.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.234
If he's been doing

09:40.300 --> 09:42.168
more mounting, he wouldn't
be in this situation.

09:42.234 --> 09:45.034
You think that my wife
is unfaithful to me

09:45.101 --> 09:47.001
because I'm not satisfying her?

09:47.067 --> 09:48.367
Son, while you're
wasting your time

09:48.433 --> 09:50.001
at the gym or the hospital,

09:50.067 --> 09:52.500
your wife is at home alone,
unoccupied.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.567
So, she hired herself
a pinch hitter.

09:54.634 --> 09:56.001
Still can't believe

09:56.067 --> 09:58.567
that your missus is taking on
new customers.

09:58.634 --> 09:59.934
It's my dream come true.

10:00.001 --> 10:02.333
Ellie is exactly like Chuck,
but with lady parts.

10:03.567 --> 10:05.168
Okay. I'm going to go now.

10:05.234 --> 10:06.967
Whoa, whoa. Come on.

10:07.034 --> 10:08.001
That's the spirit, son.

10:08.067 --> 10:09.268
Show the old lady

10:09.333 --> 10:10.567
you know how to swing that bat.

10:10.634 --> 10:12.067
Nice work, guys- awesome.

10:12.134 --> 10:13.767
What?
No, not you, Awesome.

10:13.834 --> 10:16.134
That's awesome.

10:17.801 --> 10:21.333
General, I want to thank you
in advance for your testimony.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.634
Now, it's my understanding
that, uh, you've been in charge

10:23.700 --> 10:25.634
of the Intersect project
ever since it accidentally

10:25.700 --> 10:29.268
was put into a civilian-
a one Charles Bartowski.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.600
Is that correct?

10:31.667 --> 10:33.400
Yes, sir. That is correct.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.700
Is it also correct that
the project has fallen

10:35.767 --> 10:38.034
well short of its
original expectations?

10:38.101 --> 10:40.367
Yes, sir. Also correct.

10:40.433 --> 10:43.034
But if I may add,
Agents Bartowski,

10:43.101 --> 10:44.634
Walker and Colonel Casey
have proven

10:44.700 --> 10:47.467
<i>to be an excellent
albeit unorthodox team.</i>

10:57.967 --> 11:00.268
Your mission is to
grab Shaw or kill him,

11:00.333 --> 11:02.500
whichever's quicker.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.500
Hey, open sesame.

11:13.534 --> 11:15.367
Okay, we'll split up.
Each take a floor.

11:15.433 --> 11:16.600
Okay.

11:38.433 --> 11:41.067
<i>General Meriwether,
Members of the Tribunal,</i>

11:41.134 --> 11:42.367
<i>you must understand,</i>

11:42.433 --> 11:45.867
Agent Bartowski has in many ways
exceeded expectations.

11:45.934 --> 11:49.901
I am not denying that the road
has been long and rocky.

11:49.967 --> 11:53.168
but after three years,
Charles Bartowski is poised

11:53.234 --> 11:56.268
to become the weapon we have
always dreamed of.

12:04.367 --> 12:05.367
Justin, what's going on?

12:05.433 --> 12:06.567
We've been breached.

12:06.634 --> 12:08.367
It's Casey, isn't it?
Don't worry.

12:08.433 --> 12:10.767
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you, Ellie.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.801
We can handle
John Casey.

12:16.134 --> 12:17.500
You're supposed to be upstairs.

12:17.567 --> 12:19.367
Searched the whole floor.
Nobody here.

12:19.433 --> 12:21.101
There's something wrong
with this place.

12:21.168 --> 12:24.367
Hey, look. It's a government-
grade biometric scanner.

12:24.433 --> 12:25.600
You'll never get through that.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.767
Come on.
Let's go!

12:31.867 --> 12:33.867
Casey, this is not a Ring base.

12:33.934 --> 12:35.268
It's one of ours.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.234
We've got to go find Chuck.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.700
Justin...

13:07.134 --> 13:08.101
Justin?

13:12.134 --> 13:14.268
Chuck?

13:22.167 --> 13:24.734
Ellie? Ellie, what are you
doing here?

13:24.800 --> 13:26.567
<i>What are you doing here?!</i>

13:26.634 --> 13:29.100
You just punched
a person. Chuck,

13:29.167 --> 13:31.267
I thought you quit
kung fu in the third grade.

13:31.334 --> 13:33.701
I... Look, I'll explain later.
Right now we have

13:33.768 --> 13:35.067
to get out of here.

13:35.134 --> 13:36.933
Come on. No, Chuck,
you don't understand.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.467
You've been brought here
for your protection.

13:38.534 --> 13:39.933
Justin is my CIA handler.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.634
CIA handler?

13:41.701 --> 13:42.768
<i>You don't understand, okay?</i>

13:42.833 --> 13:44.367
This guy is not CIA. Everyone

13:44.434 --> 13:46.534
Security! in this building
works for an evil organization.

13:48.134 --> 13:49.134
Chuck, wait!

13:52.134 --> 13:55.701
In conclusion, General,
I would stake my reputation

13:55.768 --> 13:58.034
on the success
of Agent Bartowski.

14:04.534 --> 14:06.301
As you were saying,
General Beckman?

14:06.367 --> 14:09.833
What the hell are you doing,
Bartowski?!

14:09.900 --> 14:12.034
Chuck, what the
hell is going on?

14:13.501 --> 14:16.967
Apparently, I have no idea.

14:25.401 --> 14:27.000
Where's my sister?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.267
She's being escorted back
to her residence.

14:29.367 --> 14:30.833
What was she doing her

14:30.900 --> 14:33.534
You are dismissed.

14:34.768 --> 14:36.301
General, what the hell
is going on?

14:38.734 --> 14:42.301
I don't know how else
to explain it, Chuck,

14:42.367 --> 14:43.867
but all our ass...

14:43.933 --> 14:45.367
<i>careers are on the line.</i>

14:45.434 --> 14:47.067
The committee is here

14:47.134 --> 14:49.467
to determine if the Intersect
project is a liability.

14:49.534 --> 14:51.000
Liability? Let me talk to them.

14:51.067 --> 14:52.267
Shaw is somewhere
in this building.

14:52.334 --> 14:54.034
We saw him.
If there is one thing

14:54.100 --> 14:56.134
you can do to protect
the Intersect project,

14:56.200 --> 14:59.067
it's keep your mouth shut.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.668
Agents Walker, Casey
and Bartowski,

15:02.734 --> 15:04.267
it's been brought to this
committee's attention

15:04.334 --> 15:06.833
the Intersect is unstable,
expensive,

15:06.900 --> 15:08.933
and most of all, dangerous.

15:09.000 --> 15:09.933
That's outrageous.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.100
Sit down, Chuck!

15:11.167 --> 15:11.234
I'm sorry, General.

15:12.467 --> 15:13.833
General, this is crazy.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.734
Provide one shred of evidence.
Who said this?

15:15.800 --> 15:17.867
I did.

15:26.334 --> 15:27.933
Hello, Chuck.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.900
Sarah.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.467
Shaw?

15:35.701 --> 15:36.933
Ladies and gentleman,

15:37.000 --> 15:40.100
this man that stands before you
is a Ring operative.

15:40.167 --> 15:43.100
He kidnapped me and he drugged
me and he tried to kill me!

15:43.167 --> 15:44.534
All of that is
completely true,

15:44.601 --> 15:46.134
except for the
killing part.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.967
In fact, I was sanctioned
by this committee.

15:49.034 --> 15:50.200
Why was I not apprised

15:50.267 --> 15:51.267
of this,
General Meriwether?

15:51.334 --> 15:52.601
Continue, Agent Shaw.

15:52.668 --> 15:56.234
I was acting as a double agent,
working within the Ring.

15:56.301 --> 15:58.601
That is, until Chuck shot me.

15:58.668 --> 16:00.701
He's lying! Do not listen
to a word that he says!

16:00.768 --> 16:01.734
I came here today

16:01.800 --> 16:03.900
to make one thing
perfectly clear.

16:03.967 --> 16:06.567
Charles Bartowski
is an American hero.

16:06.634 --> 16:09.668
He didn't ask for the Intersect.

16:09.734 --> 16:11.734
And it's not Chuck's fault
that his brain is deteriorating.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.267
Excuse me,
Agent Bartowski was given

16:13.334 --> 16:15.000
a full psychological exam,
and he was

16:15.067 --> 16:16.501
<i>cleared for all field work.</i>

16:16.567 --> 16:17.967
Sarah...

16:18.034 --> 16:20.501
Do you want to tell her
the truth or should I?

16:20.567 --> 16:22.501
What is he talking
about, Chuck?

16:23.833 --> 16:24.867
Dr. Dreyfus's report.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.833
"The subject's mental decline

16:26.900 --> 16:28.134
"is both inevitable

16:28.200 --> 16:30.100
"and irreversible.

16:30.167 --> 16:32.567
"Agent Bartowski's mind
will soon succumb to paranoia,

16:32.634 --> 16:35.434
dementia, psychosis,
possibly worse."

16:35.501 --> 16:37.134
I can understand why

16:37.200 --> 16:39.267
your boyfriend didn't want
to worry you.

16:39.334 --> 16:41.167
Sarah, I was gonna tell you.

16:43.134 --> 16:45.267
It's my recommendation

16:45.334 --> 16:47.701
that the Intersect project
be aborted.

16:47.768 --> 16:51.367
Before any decisions are made,
this committee

16:51.434 --> 16:55.467
<i>needs to review the Intersect's
successful missions.</i>

16:55.534 --> 16:58.534
Hugo Panzer: taken out
by Bartowski's team

16:58.601 --> 17:02.800
with a combination of a fencing
foil, nunchuks and turbulence.

17:02.867 --> 17:07.200
Alexis White died while trying
to elude capture from...

17:14.067 --> 17:15.967
Guys, Casey, Sarah...

17:16.034 --> 17:18.000
Zip it, Bartowski.
Figure a way out later.

17:18.067 --> 17:20.701
No, he's, he's,
he's an Intersect!

17:20.768 --> 17:23.134
Daniel Shaw is
an Intersect!

17:23.200 --> 17:25.000
Sit down, Agent Bartowski!

17:25.067 --> 17:26.233
It's okay, General.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.401
I'm glad
you're seeing this.

17:27.467 --> 17:29.034
See? He's not in control.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.534
I'm in complete control.

17:30.601 --> 17:32.401
I realize that what
I'm about to do right now

17:32.467 --> 17:35.900
might come across as being
some kind of insane gesture

17:35.967 --> 17:37.267
or maybe a completely
insane gesture,

17:37.334 --> 17:38.701
but because I am
in fact saying,

17:38.768 --> 17:40.534
and I am certain that

17:40.601 --> 17:41.833
Daniel Shaw is an Intersect,

17:41.900 --> 17:44.734
I'm just gonna have
to prove it to you.

17:45.668 --> 17:47.000
Chuck, no!

17:48.134 --> 17:49.601
You're supposed to catch it!

17:49.668 --> 17:53.301
Guards, remove Mr. Bartowski!

17:53.367 --> 17:57.501
No! He's an Intersect!

17:57.567 --> 17:59.100
Sarah, I'm sorry.

17:59.167 --> 18:01.668
These proceedings are adjourned
until further notice.

18:02.933 --> 18:04.301
We gotta get out
of here.

18:04.367 --> 18:05.501
We walked
into a trap.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.367
What about Chuck?
Nothing we can do for him.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.301
Not after that stunt. We
have to call Washington

18:09.367 --> 18:10.967
and tell them what
is really going on.

18:11.034 --> 18:12.401
Most of Washington
was in that room.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.234
Shaw and the Ring have
taken over the CIA.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.234
He's got the whole chain of
command eating out of his hand.

18:16.301 --> 18:18.567
God only knows how many
Ring agents are on the inside.

18:18.634 --> 18:20.933
It's only a matter of time
before they burn us, too.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.900
So, what? You're just gonna run?

18:22.967 --> 18:25.467
It's not just us
they're gonna come after.

18:25.534 --> 18:27.601
They're gonna come after
the people we care about.

18:27.668 --> 18:29.301
You coming?
No.

18:29.367 --> 18:33.200
Everything I care about
is inside this building.

18:33.267 --> 18:35.134
Good luck, Agent Walker...

18:36.067 --> 18:37.434
Sarah.

18:46.701 --> 18:47.734
Ellie.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.800
Devon, I need to talk to you.

18:51.867 --> 18:53.434
Where have you been all night?

18:53.501 --> 18:54.933
Okay, honey,
I- I need you to listen

18:55.000 --> 18:56.768
to me really carefully;
I have been keeping

18:56.833 --> 18:58.634
a secret from you,
and I feel horrible about it.

18:58.701 --> 18:59.634
No. Stop, okay?

18:59.701 --> 19:01.301
I just, I don't
think I can hear

19:01.367 --> 19:02.467
the words right now.

19:02.534 --> 19:03.900
It's my fault.
It's my fault.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.334
I haven't been stepping up
to the plate.

19:05.401 --> 19:06.401
Devon, I need you to be strong.

19:06.467 --> 19:07.833
I can be stronger.
I can superset.

19:07.900 --> 19:08.900
I will double my workouts...

19:08.967 --> 19:09.933
Devon, stop it!

19:10.000 --> 19:11.933
Chuck is in trouble
with the CIA!

19:12.000 --> 19:13.833
What?
Chuck,

19:13.900 --> 19:15.067
our Chuck

19:15.134 --> 19:16.567
punched a CIA agent

19:16.634 --> 19:19.634
in the face today, and they
are holding him right now.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.334
You mean, you haven't
been cheating on me?

19:21.401 --> 19:23.401
What? Devon, what
are you talking about?

19:23.467 --> 19:24.567
No. Listen to me.
I think

19:24.634 --> 19:25.634
he's gonna need a lawyer.

19:25.701 --> 19:27.067
No, no, Chuck has been

19:27.134 --> 19:28.334
with the CIA for years.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.167
I'm so glad
you finally know.

19:31.234 --> 19:33.200
What a relief
it is to talk...

19:35.501 --> 19:36.701
You don't know.

19:38.668 --> 19:40.800
Oh, no, I just told you.

19:40.867 --> 19:45.200
You are gonna tell me
everything you know right now.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.334
Order's up.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.833
Alex...

19:54.900 --> 19:57.601
You come here for the pie,
too, Agent Casey?

19:57.668 --> 19:59.267
I think it's
the best in town.

19:59.334 --> 20:00.434
Hey, guy.

20:00.501 --> 20:01.768
And you brought
a friend.

20:01.833 --> 20:02.833
Table for two, please.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.267
Right this way.

20:22.701 --> 20:25.800
Sergeant Mosley, you're needed
in the conference room ASAP.

20:25.867 --> 20:26.967
That means run.

20:32.933 --> 20:35.401
Follow you where, Dad?

20:45.734 --> 20:47.933
Chuck!

20:51.668 --> 20:53.034
Here you go.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.701
Thank you
very much.

20:54.768 --> 20:57.167
You're welcome. Enjoy.

20:57.234 --> 20:58.768
Pretty girl.

20:59.933 --> 21:00.933
So much to live for.

21:02.434 --> 21:04.200
Be a shame if she didn't.

21:05.434 --> 21:07.567
Not hungry?

21:07.634 --> 21:11.067
Why don't you put your hands
on the table, John?

21:15.701 --> 21:17.367
Good.

21:20.701 --> 21:21.933
Mmm.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.100
Too much nutmeg.

21:27.534 --> 21:29.100
You're a smart guy, John.

21:29.167 --> 21:30.501
I'm sure you figured it out
by now.

21:30.567 --> 21:31.900
You're coming with me.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.234
I gotta say, John,

21:33.301 --> 21:36.601
I never figured you for a dad.

21:36.668 --> 21:38.601
Well, I'm not a very good one.

21:43.067 --> 21:44.067
What are you doing?!

21:44.134 --> 21:46.000
I'm saving your life.
Put me down!

21:46.768 --> 21:48.567
Hey! Ow!

21:52.134 --> 21:53.534
Chuck, wait!

21:53.601 --> 21:54.867
Where are you going?

21:54.933 --> 21:55.967
Sarah, I have to leave.

21:56.034 --> 21:57.067
My-my-my dad is coming.
Oh, you can't.

21:57.134 --> 21:58.367
You have to stay and fight.

21:58.434 --> 21:59.701
If you run, they'll
put a burn notice

21:59.768 --> 22:01.034
on you,
and you'll be running forever.

22:03.134 --> 22:04.768
We have to move
right now!

22:04.833 --> 22:06.100
You can't do this.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.800
If you run, there's a
bull's-eye on your back.

22:07.867 --> 22:09.301
They will never ever
stop looking for you.

22:09.367 --> 22:11.367
If you stay, everyone you love
will be in danger.

22:11.434 --> 22:13.601
You have to choose who you
want to protect: you or her.

22:13.668 --> 22:14.967
Dad, please don't leave...

22:18.334 --> 22:19.267
Right now, Charles!

22:19.334 --> 22:22.100
You have to run
to protect her!

22:22.167 --> 22:23.467
I'm sorry, Sarah.

22:23.534 --> 22:25.567
I'm sorry,
but if I have to choose,

22:25.634 --> 22:27.867
I will always choose
to protect you.

22:43.134 --> 22:45.867
Sorry, Alex, but this is
for your own safety.

22:45.934 --> 22:47.934
You have to believe
I would never hurt you.

22:48.001 --> 22:52.467
No, just forcibly kidnap me.

22:52.534 --> 22:54.801
Here...

22:54.867 --> 22:56.201
take it.

22:56.268 --> 22:58.034
This is a key
to my locker

22:58.101 --> 22:59.700
at the Burbank Buy More.

22:59.767 --> 23:02.001
Everything inside is yours now.

23:02.067 --> 23:06.201
Look, Mr. Casey,
if you want me to hear you,

23:06.268 --> 23:08.500
I'd step out of the car and talk

23:08.567 --> 23:11.168
so that I don't feel like
my life is in jeopardy.

23:12.934 --> 23:15.333
Please?

23:18.901 --> 23:21.001
Okay.

23:26.433 --> 23:29.500
Alex, wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! No, no, no, no...

23:29.567 --> 23:30.867
Wait! Come on!

23:33.767 --> 23:36.067
I got an A
in my self-defense class!

23:36.134 --> 23:38.700
Alex...

23:38.767 --> 23:40.367
Alex, I'm your father.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.667
That's impossible!

23:45.734 --> 23:47.767
My father's dead.
He was a war hero.

23:47.834 --> 23:50.268
He died before
I was even born.

23:50.333 --> 23:51.268
No, I didn't.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.600
Stop it.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.600
You were named
after your dad, Alex.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.834
You're named after me.

23:57.901 --> 24:00.333
My real name's Alex Coburn.

24:03.834 --> 24:06.634
Please, you have to trust me.

24:06.700 --> 24:08.767
You have to get
to your mom and disappear.

24:08.834 --> 24:10.034
Go, Alex.

24:10.101 --> 24:11.067
Run!

24:20.500 --> 24:24.034
CIA! John Casey, put your hands
on top of your head!

24:28.433 --> 24:30.101
That whole Generalissimo thing?

24:30.168 --> 24:31.967
I was undercover on a mission.

24:32.034 --> 24:32.967
That's it.

24:33.034 --> 24:34.400
That's all I know, babe.

24:34.467 --> 24:36.234
Oh, and you can
blame the CIA

24:36.300 --> 24:37.433
for my bachelor party.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.067
Stripper?
She was an agent.

24:39.134 --> 24:40.333
Told you I didn't cheat.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.333
Faithful.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.268
I can't believe that my brother
and Sarah are spies.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.268
How is my dad
involved in all this?

24:47.333 --> 24:51.001
I, uh, have pockets
of missing knowledge.

24:51.067 --> 24:52.333
I didn't want to know

24:52.400 --> 24:53.767
'cause I didn't want to have

24:53.834 --> 24:55.067
to lie to you, babe.

24:55.134 --> 24:57.300
Devon, an actual legitimate
answer exists

24:57.367 --> 24:59.801
as to why my father has
been missing my entire life,

24:59.867 --> 25:01.967
and you didn't think
to ask that question?

25:02.034 --> 25:04.734
Correct.

25:04.801 --> 25:06.767
You need to find me somebody
who knows

25:06.834 --> 25:08.834
a lot more than you do
right now.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.433
Morgan Grimes,
the boy that took

25:12.500 --> 25:14.767
my pillow as his date
to Junior Prom

25:14.834 --> 25:17.168
knows more about my family
being spies than I do.

25:17.234 --> 25:18.201
Here.

25:18.268 --> 25:19.901
It's valerian
root tea,

25:19.967 --> 25:21.667
and it'll give your brain
a lovely, soothing bath.

25:21.734 --> 25:24.534
I don't want a soothing brain
bath, Morgan. I want answers.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.201
Startling revelation,

25:26.268 --> 25:27.667
yeah, I know.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.700
Well, Chuck has been with the
Company for quite a while now.

25:30.767 --> 25:34.500
Suffice to say all
is in hand, so...

25:34.567 --> 25:37.034
No, Morgan, all is
not in hand, okay?

25:37.101 --> 25:38.834
The bad guys have my brother.

25:38.901 --> 25:39.867
Hold on a second.

25:39.934 --> 25:41.634
Nobody said anything
about bad guys.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.034
What bad guys? The Ring? What?

25:44.101 --> 25:46.201
The Ring; a nefarious
criminal organization

25:46.268 --> 25:48.400
hell-bent on world
domination. All I know is that

25:48.467 --> 25:50.634
Justin told me that John Casey
is a double agent.

25:50.700 --> 25:52.967
And he's here trying
to gather information

25:53.034 --> 25:55.101
about my dad, but if
Chuck is an agent, too,

25:55.168 --> 25:57.134
then-then maybe
Casey lied to him

25:57.201 --> 25:59.168
and turned him somehow?

25:59.234 --> 26:00.534
Our Eagle Scout Chuck

26:00.600 --> 26:01.934
turned to the dark side?

26:02.001 --> 26:03.967
No, not gonna happen.
And any suggestions

26:04.034 --> 26:06.667
that Colonel Jonathan Casey's
character's in question,

26:06.734 --> 26:08.333
well, I would stake my entire...

26:08.400 --> 26:09.634
albeit.. okay,

26:09.700 --> 26:11.834
thin reputation
on the fact that he is

26:11.901 --> 26:14.801
Uncle Sam's
most faithful servant.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.567
Fine. Then one of you

26:16.634 --> 26:18.067
geniuses explain to me

26:18.134 --> 26:20.567
why the CIA is holding my
brother against his will.

26:20.634 --> 26:23.667
I don't know,
but I will find out.

26:27.867 --> 26:29.534
You wanted
to see me...

26:29.600 --> 26:30.667
sir?

26:30.734 --> 26:32.234
I'd be remiss if I didn't

26:32.300 --> 26:34.001
tell you you looked
great, Walker.

26:34.067 --> 26:35.534
Love suits you, I guess.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.634
Shut up, Shaw.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.134
This is crap and you know it.

26:38.201 --> 26:42.001
Only two people know what
happened that day in Paris.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.534
It's your word against mine.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.634
Chuck saw what happened.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.333
We all know that you tried
to kill me.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.333
But Chuck has become
an unreliable witness.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.834
His mind has
been compromised

26:49.901 --> 26:51.168
by the Intersect.

26:51.234 --> 26:55.201
And now that he's escaped,
he seems so guilty.

26:55.268 --> 26:58.001
I'm sorry that you had to learn
about his mental deterioration

26:58.067 --> 26:59.867
in such a public forum.

26:59.934 --> 27:02.234
Sad that he
never told you

27:02.300 --> 27:03.700
in a more
intimate setting...

27:03.767 --> 27:05.801
Sam.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.834
You're gonna put
your hands up

27:09.901 --> 27:11.667
and you're gonna walk
out that door

27:11.734 --> 27:13.734
and you're gonna tell
the generals

27:13.801 --> 27:15.433
exactly what happened in Paris.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.367
So move it.

27:17.433 --> 27:18.500
I knew you'd bite.

27:20.433 --> 27:23.067
Drop it, Agent Walker!

27:23.134 --> 27:26.001
Arrest her.
She's gone rogue.

27:26.867 --> 27:28.634
It's a shame.

27:28.700 --> 27:30.534
I remember when nothing
affected you.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.767
Now you're as emotional
as your boyfriend.

27:45.034 --> 27:47.400
Sarah and Casey will know
how to help Chuck, okay?

27:47.467 --> 27:49.567
You just go check the
dojo. There's a dojo?

27:52.168 --> 27:53.101
General Beckman?

27:53.168 --> 27:54.134
Where's Bartowski?

27:54.201 --> 27:55.801
I'd hoped to find him in Castle.

27:55.867 --> 27:58.433
I think there's been some
sort of mix-up. Chuck is being

27:58.500 --> 28:00.168
held by the CIA. Maybe you could
actually help clear this up.

28:00.234 --> 28:02.634
This is great. General
Beckman, open the door.

28:02.700 --> 28:03.634
General, what's happening?

28:03.700 --> 28:04.734
Open the door right now!

28:04.801 --> 28:06.433
They're shutting down

28:06.500 --> 28:08.201
the entire Intersect project,
including myself.

28:08.268 --> 28:09.600
They apprehended Colonel Casey.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.934
Agent Walker is in
custody. Bartowski

28:12.001 --> 28:14.168
escaped this facility;
he is a wanted man.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.834
I need you
to find him.

28:15.901 --> 28:17.268
As much as it pains me

28:17.333 --> 28:20.067
to admit,
you are our only hope!

28:21.467 --> 28:23.001
You are our only hope!

28:24.567 --> 28:28.433
Get your hands off me!

28:32.101 --> 28:34.967
Dude, did she mean
you or me?

28:39.834 --> 28:41.600
* *

28:44.634 --> 28:47.034
Finished it.

28:47.101 --> 28:48.433
Your Governor.

28:53.834 --> 28:55.967
* *

28:58.067 --> 28:59.333
It will activate
immediately.

29:04.634 --> 29:06.101
Better?

29:06.168 --> 29:10.834
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

29:14.433 --> 29:17.300
Cell? That's not off
the grid, Charles.

29:17.367 --> 29:19.201
Dad, it's, it's Morgan.
I never got a chance

29:19.268 --> 29:20.201
to say good-bye to him.

29:20.268 --> 29:21.201
Hey, buddy,

29:21.268 --> 29:22.400
listen, I gotta go away.

29:22.467 --> 29:24.067
I gotta go on a trip
with my dad,

29:24.134 --> 29:26.234
and, and I could be gone
for a really long time.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.667
Yeah, well, stop.
Sarah's in CIA custody.

29:27.734 --> 29:29.667
Casey has been taken.
I think they got Beckman, too.

29:29.734 --> 29:31.934
What? When did this
happen? Hey, Dad! No!

29:32.001 --> 29:34.634
Dad! Dad, we have
to go back.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.634
Shaw has got Sarah!
And that's no accident!

29:36.700 --> 29:38.634
He doesn't want her;
he's trying to trap you.

29:38.700 --> 29:42.801
He's after this.

29:42.867 --> 29:44.500
I'm your father;
you cannot ask me.

29:44.567 --> 29:47.234
Please do not ask me to put
my own son in jeopardy.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.333
I can't just walk away, Dad!

29:49.400 --> 29:52.101
Why did you come back this time?

29:52.168 --> 29:53.400
You came back
because you wanted

29:53.467 --> 29:54.567
to protect Ellie
and me.

29:54.634 --> 29:56.767
Because you knew no matter
how far you ran,

29:56.834 --> 29:58.967
you could never live with
yourself if something happened

29:59.034 --> 30:00.333
to somebody that you loved.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.667
* *

30:05.534 --> 30:06.534
If we do this...

30:08.034 --> 30:10.234
we gotta be smart.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.600
Not think emotional!

30:14.134 --> 30:15.767
We can do this.

30:15.834 --> 30:16.967
We're Bartowskis.

30:25.234 --> 30:26.333
Ellie.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.834
Chuck, I thought

30:28.901 --> 30:32.001
that the CIA still had you.
I wish I had time to explain.

30:32.067 --> 30:33.234
You know what, Chuck?

30:33.300 --> 30:35.901
It takes just as long to say
that as to tell me

30:35.967 --> 30:37.333
what the hell is going on.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.467
We need your help.

30:38.534 --> 30:40.300
Who's we, Chuck? The government?

30:40.367 --> 30:41.367
The answer is no.

30:41.433 --> 30:44.168
<i>No, we need your help.</i>

30:44.234 --> 30:47.901
Dad? I thought that you left.

30:47.967 --> 30:50.101
El, I know
you got a lot

30:50.168 --> 30:51.767
of questions,
but right now

30:51.834 --> 30:54.467
you have the answers
that we need.

30:57.134 --> 30:58.300
This is it.

30:58.367 --> 31:00.333
This is where
I would meet Justin.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.168
This is our
rendezvous point.

31:02.234 --> 31:04.333
There's got
to be more to it, okay?

31:04.400 --> 31:05.801
Shaw has to have
another location.

31:05.867 --> 31:07.034
This can't be
a dead end.

31:07.101 --> 31:08.367
What are you two
whispering about?

31:08.433 --> 31:09.834
No more secrets.

31:09.901 --> 31:11.567
May-maybe you're forgetting
something.

31:11.634 --> 31:12.834
Walk us through
what would happen

31:12.901 --> 31:13.867
when you met Justin.

31:13.934 --> 31:15.234
I don't know, Dad,
this is it.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.867
I would, I would sit here
on this bench and we would talk.

31:17.934 --> 31:19.600
And then he'd
get up, he'd leave.

31:19.667 --> 31:21.567
He'd go over there.

31:21.634 --> 31:23.467
Through that door.

31:23.534 --> 31:24.534
The subway again.

31:27.268 --> 31:29.168
Hey, we need you
to stay here, okay?

31:29.234 --> 31:31.467
You just stay
right here on this bench.

31:31.534 --> 31:33.801
If we're not back
in 20 minutes, run.

31:33.867 --> 31:36.901
Dad, I need
to hear you say it.

31:36.967 --> 31:40.634
I need to know that there's
a reason that you left us.

31:43.268 --> 31:44.634
It's a long story.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.300
I want to tell you everything,
but I gotta,

31:47.367 --> 31:48.667
I gotta take care
of this first, okay?

31:52.034 --> 31:53.700
This is the last time

31:53.767 --> 31:56.534
I'm gonna walk
away from you.

31:57.567 --> 31:58.567
I promise.

31:58.634 --> 32:00.567
I love you, baby.

32:12.367 --> 32:14.534
You're not gonna
get away with this, Shaw.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.367
Yes, I will.

32:16.433 --> 32:19.034
Love-soaked Bartowski
will try to come save you,

32:19.101 --> 32:20.467
and this time
I'll be ready

32:20.534 --> 32:21.667
<i>for him and
his father.</i>

32:21.734 --> 32:23.700
Mu-ha-ha.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.134
Over here. Over here.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.067
Dad...

32:43.034 --> 32:45.667
This control panel
was manufactured

32:45.734 --> 32:46.700
by McTiernan Industries.

32:46.767 --> 32:47.967
It's a Ring subsidiary.

32:56.834 --> 32:58.134
Fake wall.

32:59.134 --> 33:00.567
Aces, Charles.

33:07.001 --> 33:09.400
All right.

33:18.567 --> 33:21.834
Shaw, Bartowski's
infiltrated the base.

33:21.901 --> 33:23.333
Of course he did.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.134
Why won't your boyfriend
ever think

33:25.201 --> 33:26.801
with an organ besides his heart?

33:26.867 --> 33:29.268
No, sir, not this one.

33:29.333 --> 33:30.867
Bartowski and his father
found the other base,

33:30.934 --> 33:32.067
the Ring base.

33:32.134 --> 33:33.500
Triggered
the silent alarm.

33:36.700 --> 33:37.934
Damn it.

33:41.268 --> 33:43.700
Hmm. Don't know
when it happened,

33:43.767 --> 33:45.234
but our boy
became a man.

33:45.300 --> 33:48.168
Bartowski's a spy.

33:49.567 --> 33:51.934
Picked a good
one, Walker...

33:52.001 --> 33:53.934
finally.

33:59.767 --> 34:01.500
Oh, my God.

34:03.934 --> 34:07.134
Dad, this is what I've
been having dreams about.

34:07.201 --> 34:09.134
Dr. Kowambe's medical
experiments;

34:09.201 --> 34:10.567
cellular regeneration.

34:14.101 --> 34:16.766
It's identical. They did it.

34:16.833 --> 34:19.201
I can't believe
the Ring built one.

34:19.268 --> 34:21.766
They must have saved
Shaw's life, and then...

34:21.833 --> 34:25.268
and then turned him
into an Intersect.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.567
I was right.

34:40.766 --> 34:43.134
Dad, the lab is all
the proof that we need.

34:43.201 --> 34:45.300
It'll vindicate my team,
Shaw will be exposed.

34:45.367 --> 34:48.467
Exposed? Exposed as what,
uh, the Intersect?

34:48.534 --> 34:51.934
I see you got a fancy
new watch there, Chuck.

34:52.001 --> 34:53.734
Do you mind

34:53.801 --> 34:54.934
if I try it on?

34:58.600 --> 35:01.067
Why don't you come over
here and take it from me?

35:01.134 --> 35:05.234
Actually, I think I'll have
my friend grab it for me.

35:15.101 --> 35:17.801
I don't need a watch
to beat you, Shaw.

35:19.201 --> 35:21.634
Come on.
Aren't you a little curious?

35:21.700 --> 35:23.134
I know I am.

35:23.201 --> 35:25.134
Don't you want

35:25.201 --> 35:27.500
to know how your Intersect
stacks up against mine?

35:27.567 --> 35:29.268
You're right, Chuck.

35:29.333 --> 35:30.834
The fight will be incredible.

35:30.901 --> 35:32.201
We're totally equal now.

35:32.268 --> 35:33.634
Nothing separates us.

35:33.700 --> 35:37.901
<i>Though... there's one thing
that is different.</i>

35:39.034 --> 35:40.234
You can't function

35:40.300 --> 35:42.500
when your emotions have
been compromised.

35:42.567 --> 35:44.901
Don't worry about that.

35:44.967 --> 35:47.834
I've never been more calm.

35:47.901 --> 35:50.268
Really? How you feeling now?

36:00.567 --> 36:05.101
* *

36:08.067 --> 36:10.567
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

36:10.634 --> 36:13.767
Dad, hey, hey, hey,
hang on! Hang on!

36:13.834 --> 36:15.634
Hang on! Stay with
me! Stay with me!

36:15.700 --> 36:17.734
You're gonna be okay,
okay? I promise.

36:20.333 --> 36:21.500
You're special, son.

36:22.967 --> 36:25.667
Always remember...

36:25.734 --> 36:27.634
you're special.

37:25.901 --> 37:27.934
Check out the fresh fish.

37:28.001 --> 37:30.567
Wait here.

37:31.734 --> 37:32.834
Hello, miss.

37:32.901 --> 37:34.400
Hi.
Hi.

37:34.467 --> 37:36.367
I was wondering
if I could

37:36.434 --> 37:38.267
service you in some way.

37:38.333 --> 37:40.934
Yes, I guess. Um...

37:41.001 --> 37:43.901
could you tell me where I could
find John Casey's locker?

37:43.967 --> 37:46.567
<i>What exactly is your
relationship to Mr. Casey?</i>

37:46.634 --> 37:48.101
If I may be so bold.

37:48.168 --> 37:51.034
He's my... friend,

37:51.101 --> 37:53.068
and he asked me
to get something

37:53.134 --> 37:54.467
out of his locker.

37:54.534 --> 37:56.034
He gave me his key.

37:56.101 --> 37:58.434
That doesn't look like
one of our keys. Shh!

37:58.500 --> 38:00.534
Maybe you're talking about
a different John Casey.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.600
Ours doesn't really have
any friends.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.534
Thank you, guys.
I'll take it from here.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.567
Morgan Grimes,
assistant manager.

38:05.634 --> 38:06.734
Hi. Alex.

38:06.801 --> 38:09.200
Alex, take a walk with me?

38:09.267 --> 38:10.867
Did you say that belongs
to John Casey?

38:10.934 --> 38:12.567
Yes. Um, he does
work here, right?

38:12.634 --> 38:13.901
Of course he does.
Yeah, yeah.

38:13.967 --> 38:14.967
Who do you work for?

38:15.034 --> 38:16.400
It's okay;
you can tell me.

38:16.467 --> 38:17.901
I'm on the inside.

38:17.967 --> 38:19.500
Um, the Pie Shack
in Silverlake.

38:19.567 --> 38:20.534
Yeah, okay.
Come on.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.634
Lady, please, I have

38:21.701 --> 38:23.134
a very high level
of clearance, okay?

38:23.200 --> 38:25.233
Listen, I can't let you walk
back there, have access

38:25.300 --> 38:26.667
to John Casey's locker
without knowing what's going on.

38:26.734 --> 38:27.734
I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

38:27.801 --> 38:31.600
I don't know what's going on.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.600
All I know is that
this customer John

38:33.667 --> 38:36.068
kidnaps me, and then he tells me
that he's my father,

38:36.134 --> 38:37.567
and now there's
men chasing us.

38:37.634 --> 38:38.801
And I'm sorry. I know

38:38.867 --> 38:40.267
that I don't
really know you.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.300
I'm just a little
confused right now.

38:42.367 --> 38:44.667
No, no, that's okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you upset.

38:44.734 --> 38:46.901
Look, miss,
I promise you this:

38:46.967 --> 38:49.267
if John Casey said he's your
father, then it's the truth.

38:49.333 --> 38:50.767
I trust that man with my life.

38:50.834 --> 38:51.934
You have nothing
to be afraid of.

38:52.001 --> 38:53.300
<i>Not if he's your father.</i>

38:53.367 --> 38:55.600
And in fact, this store's
as safe as anywhere,

38:55.667 --> 38:58.300
provided you stay away
from those two.

39:02.068 --> 39:04.300
Yeah?
Let's go see

39:04.367 --> 39:06.134
what's in that locker, all
right? Are you okay? Yeah?

39:06.200 --> 39:08.667
This isn't a Buy More key,
so I'll have to use mine.

39:08.734 --> 39:10.701
Assistant manager.

39:10.767 --> 39:11.867
That's why
I have this.

39:11.934 --> 39:12.967
So you know.

39:18.634 --> 39:21.934
Okay. Avid reader.

39:23.901 --> 39:26.034
Oh, my. Whoa!

39:26.101 --> 39:28.168
How long it's been
in there. Yeah.

39:28.233 --> 39:31.333
Oh, check it out.

39:31.434 --> 39:32.333
That's gonna work.

39:33.867 --> 39:35.767
Oh, actually, you might
want to stand back.

39:35.834 --> 39:38.134
This could explode.

39:39.434 --> 39:41.567
Ooh... okay.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.500
He said this is for you?

39:49.567 --> 39:53.333
Yeah. What is it?

39:54.467 --> 39:55.934
He must have been saving

39:56.001 --> 39:58.567
for, like, ever.
We don't pay that much here.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.667
Morgan, Ellie called.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.068
We need to talk.

40:04.134 --> 40:05.634
Yeah, shoot, buddy.
Whatever you got to say,

40:05.701 --> 40:07.001
you can say
in front of her.

40:07.068 --> 40:09.034
She's one of us.
Not this.

40:13.333 --> 40:16.967
Try not to spend it
all in one place.

40:21.701 --> 40:23.068
Chuck, what happened?

40:23.134 --> 40:26.400
Are you okay?

40:27.934 --> 40:29.701
Where's your dad?

40:29.767 --> 40:33.233
I'm sorry, guys.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.600
Shaw has won.

40:37.134 --> 40:39.233
Oh, my God.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.267
I'm so sorry.

40:41.333 --> 40:43.400
Don't worry, buddy,
we'll get Shaw.

40:44.434 --> 40:46.134
No, we won't.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.634
Love the new defeatist
attitude, Chuck.

40:48.701 --> 40:50.001
Suits you.

40:50.068 --> 40:51.801
We'll be leaving
momentarily

40:51.867 --> 40:53.567
for the CIA
detention facility.

40:53.634 --> 40:56.934
These people won't be seeing
the light of day for some time.

41:03.634 --> 41:06.434
Enjoy this ride together...
bond.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.934
share all the war stories...

41:08.001 --> 41:11.168
because as soon
as the truck stops,

41:11.233 --> 41:12.867
so do your lives.

41:30.934 --> 41:33.267
We'll figure something out.

41:33.333 --> 41:36.168
It's over.

41:36.233 --> 41:39.667
There is no one left to save us.

41:48.233 --> 41:50.934
I'm following them now.

41:51.001 --> 41:52.134
Are you ready?

41:52.200 --> 41:53.333
We're ready.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.901
I'm warning you, Ellie,
if we do this,

41:55.967 --> 41:58.701
there is no turning back-
our lives are changed forever.

41:58.767 --> 42:00.901
I'm asking one final time.

42:00.967 --> 42:03.701
Are you sure
this is what you want?

42:03.767 --> 42:05.567
Yes.

42:09.134 --> 42:12.101
Let's do this.
