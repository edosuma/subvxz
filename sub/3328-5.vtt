00:06.300 --> 00:08.291
*

00:20.280 --> 00:22.544
What do you think?

00:22.590 --> 00:24.683
Not your color.
Pretty sure this is

00:24.720 --> 00:27.188
the only color that
platypus skulls come in.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.120
I'll take it.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.458
Aanay, told you, it's
not for me, it's for Sherlock.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.219
He's into stuff like this.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.319
You name a kid something
like Sherlock, you pretty much

00:35.360 --> 00:37.123
guarantee he's gonna be
into stuff like that.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.593
Actually, his name is
the least odd thing about him.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.165
I'm gonna have to introduce you
one of these days.

00:42.210 --> 00:46.169
I'm hoping this little guy
will distract him for a while.

00:46.210 --> 00:47.768
He's been bored.

00:47.810 --> 00:50.779
No interesting murder cases
in the last couple of weeks.

00:50.810 --> 00:53.643
Oh, poor thing.
(laughs)

00:56.150 --> 01:00.553
You know, if you guys
are really looking for
something to do...

01:00.590 --> 01:02.820
Yeah?
(sighs) Nothing. It's
embarrassing, actually.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.624
Oh, is it?
Look, I was thinking
about you last week

01:05.660 --> 01:08.493
and I was gonna
call you, and I...

01:08.530 --> 01:11.624
I'm trying to find a guy
that I lost track of.

01:11.670 --> 01:12.694
Uh-huh.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.766
A one-night stand.
(gasps)

01:15.800 --> 01:19.236
Jennifer Sayles!

01:19.280 --> 01:22.306
I met him_ after one of our
girls' nights, actually.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.399
Do you remember, like,
a year ago, drinks in Midtown,

01:25.450 --> 01:26.849
and you bailed early?

01:26.880 --> 01:29.849
Well, I ended up at this
little bar on 42nd,

01:29.890 --> 01:31.846
and... I met Tony.

01:31.890 --> 01:34.688
Okay, does Tony
have a last name?

01:34.720 --> 01:36.585
Look, I know that he's
a photojournalist,

01:36.630 --> 01:40.452
I know that he is amazing
and that we just clicked.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.196
It wasn't just a drunken thing.
It wasn't, I'm telling you.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.391
After the bar, we went
to a gallery opening,

01:45.430 --> 01:47.534
and then we ended up
back at my place.

01:47.570 --> 01:50.607
The whole night, it
was just... perfect.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.608
It was like a movie.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.801
Except he had a flight
first thing in the morning.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.741
Some job in Paris
for a couple of months.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.543
We didn't even
exchange numbers.

01:59.580 --> 02:01.445
Jen, I have to be honest.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.880
I mean, if all you have
is a first name,

02:03.920 --> 02:05.888
I don't even know
where I'd begin.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.151
Anyway, this isn't
the kind of thing
that Sherlock and I do.

02:09.190 --> 02:11.556
Yeah, but you're great
at this, right?

02:11.590 --> 02:14.889
You're great at it,
and, Joan, I swear,

02:14.930 --> 02:18.627
I would never, ever
ask you to help me with
something so mortifying

02:18.670 --> 02:21.798
if I didn't think that this guy
might really be the one.

02:24.470 --> 02:26.506
HOLMES:
What you are describing
is not a case, it is

02:26.540 --> 02:28.804
a wild goose chase, only at
the end of a proper goose chase

02:28.840 --> 02:30.705
you get to eat a delicious
goose-- in this instance,

02:30.750 --> 02:33.241
your friend gets to find out
that some sweaty Lothario

02:33.280 --> 02:34.770
is not the man
of her dreams.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.685
Do you want to
help me or not?

02:36.720 --> 02:39.450
You are a consulting detective,
you are my partner.

02:39.490 --> 02:41.708
The work you are describing
falls somewhere between

02:41.760 --> 02:44.854
photographing philandering
spouses and finding a lost cat.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.858
I urge you to have
some professional pride.

02:46.900 --> 02:50.290
I do. Okay, she's my friend,
and she asked me for my help.

02:50.330 --> 02:52.833
Anyway, it's not like we have
anything better to work on.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.191
We have cold cases,
dozens of them.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.798
You have been looking
at these for days,

02:56.840 --> 02:59.400
and so far the only things
you have solved are the theft

02:59.440 --> 03:01.203
of a penny-farthing bicycle
and a nonfatal arson case

03:01.240 --> 03:02.798
which is older than my father.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.977
You have not left the house
In a week,

03:05.010 --> 03:08.616
and you're beginning to smell
like old mimeographs.
Be that as it may,

03:08.650 --> 03:10.618
I'm quite certain
that we can do better

03:10.650 --> 03:12.811
than helping your friend
find an MIA pickup artist.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.851
_ How?
Sometimes, Watson,

03:14.890 --> 03:17.381
when one wants a diamond,
one must resort

03:17.430 --> 03:19.557
to digging in a diamond mine.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.296
(Holmes sniffs)

03:22.330 --> 03:26.289
WATSON: For future reference,
a morgue is not a diamond mine.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.932
It's better.

03:27.970 --> 03:31.360
Diamonds are just pressed coal;
corpses have stories, secrets.

03:31.410 --> 03:33.628
(low groan) You said
you had an "in" here.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.309
A certain deputy medical
examiner who can be relied
upon to allow me access.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.739
And he's okay with letting
a civilian waltz in here

03:39.780 --> 03:42.613
to shop for a wrongful
death he might have
missed because...?

03:42.650 --> 03:44.948
Because he's so competitive,
it borders on illness.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.787
Let me guess--

03:46.820 --> 03:49.823
somebody wants
an ass-kicking?

03:49.860 --> 03:51.384
First time for everything,
I suppose.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.718
This is Joan Watson,
my partner.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.920
This is Dr. Eugene Hawes,
my sparring partner.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.837
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
You, too.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.007
Usual stakes?

04:03.040 --> 04:06.476
My cash against your corpses.

04:10.910 --> 04:12.002
(scoffs)

04:12.050 --> 04:13.574
Ponziani?
You think you can

04:13.620 --> 04:15.645
come in here with
that weak stuff?

04:19.660 --> 04:22.629
0 for 19-- I think
it's time to call it a day.

04:22.660 --> 04:24.355
I'm seriously starving,
and that is something

04:24.390 --> 04:25.880
that should not be
happening in here.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.795
Well, there's
a vending machine
down the hall,

04:27.830 --> 04:30.628
and at least a dozen
more bodies, so we
have the makings

04:30.670 --> 04:32.535
of a lovely evening.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.369
Right, this is Leo... Banin.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.401
Killed when his motorcycle

04:43.450 --> 04:45.645
veered across
the yellow line

04:45.680 --> 04:48.410
into an oncoming
minivan.

04:48.450 --> 04:51.783
The driver of that vehicle,
a Melissa Aguire...

04:51.820 --> 04:53.811
was also killed.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.384
Nope, there's no mystery there.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.024
The head wound is
the cause of death

04:57.060 --> 05:00.291
and the reason
we have helmet laws.

05:01.930 --> 05:03.864
We have a case.
Sherlock,

05:03.900 --> 05:05.720
nobody killed this man.

05:05.770 --> 05:08.591
No. But the day he died,

05:08.640 --> 05:10.858
he murdered someone else.

05:47.810 --> 05:50.506
You know, we got a lot
going on here. We always do.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.847
If you're looking
for entertainment,

05:51.880 --> 05:54.576
you don't need to go
shopping at the morgue.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.043
I reviewed your open cases--
Sisyphean drudge work.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.615
Nothing half as interesting
as what we have found.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.582
A traffic fatality?

06:01.620 --> 06:03.383
A professional hit man.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.921
His driver's license
identified him as Leo Banin.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.518
According to
his obituary,

06:07.560 --> 06:09.721
he was happily married,
a deacon at his church,

06:09.770 --> 06:11.920
and an RN at a retirement home.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.767
HOLMES: But before
that, he was a member

06:13.800 --> 06:16.064
of the Rukovskaya Bratva.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.807
No_te their_ distinctive
eight-pomted star.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.934
Detective Bell was kind enough
to run Mr. Banin's fingerprints

06:21.980 --> 06:23.948
through the international
database. Leo Banin

06:23.980 --> 06:26.744
started life as Vitaly Andropov,

06:26.780 --> 06:28.645
an assassin for the Bratva's

06:28.680 --> 06:30.944
Polish outfit. Interpol
believes him responsible

06:30.990 --> 06:32.548
for a string
of gruesome killings

06:32.590 --> 06:35.684
in the Warsaw Wesola district
dating back to 2005.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.426
Later that year,
Leo Banin

06:37.460 --> 06:38.825
sprang into existence.

06:38.860 --> 06:40.953
He began a quiet life
as a nurse in Queens,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.195
got married shortly thereafter,
hasn't been heard from since.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.822
GREGSON:
Well, that makes sense.

06:44.870 --> 06:47.191
When you get tired
of killing people in Warsaw,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.538
you retire to a place
like Jackson Heights.

06:49.570 --> 06:51.435
HOLMES: I don't believe
he did retire.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.472
At least not permanently.

06:55.140 --> 06:57.540
These cuts on the
side of his palms,

06:57.580 --> 06:59.207
they are uniform, a
perfect matched pair.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.571
He was wearing gloves when he
lost control of his motorcycle

07:01.620 --> 07:03.178
and slammed into
oncoming traffIc.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.984
I don't think that those
are a result of the crash.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.851
I once apprehended
a serial killer

07:07.890 --> 07:09.755
in Kensington who
strung his guitar

07:09.790 --> 07:11.451
with six different
murder weapons.

07:11.490 --> 07:14.493
He had scars on his hands
very Similar to those.

07:14.530 --> 07:15.895
Leo's wounds are raw.

07:15.930 --> 07:18.990
I think he garroted someone
the day he died.

07:19.030 --> 07:22.033
Well, not a bad bet, considering
that was his MO. in Warsaw.

07:22.070 --> 07:24.163
Oh, and now in New York.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.678
Whoever he killed, do you think
he did it on Bratva's orders?

07:26.710 --> 07:27.870
That's one possibility.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.002
There's just one problem.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.598
Unless you have
a garroted corpse

07:30.650 --> 07:32.049
I'm not aware of,

07:32.080 --> 07:33.217
you don't have a victim.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.013
If you don't have a corpse

07:35.050 --> 07:36.745
or a missing persons report,
you don't have a case.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.212
Which is precisely why

07:38.250 --> 07:40.480
we intend to speak to
the assassinurse's wife.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.657
We're hoping she
might be able

07:41.690 --> 07:43.681
to cast some light
on the situation.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.619
Of course I knew the tattoo.

07:46.660 --> 07:51.666
I knew he came here to get away
from an unhappy life in Poland.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.839
A bad life.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.531
I didn't know he...

07:55.570 --> 07:58.630
I can't believe Leo
was a killer.

07:58.670 --> 08:02.231
Were you aware of his
real name-- Vitaly?

08:02.280 --> 08:05.044
His name, to me, was Leo.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.514
That was his real name.

08:07.550 --> 08:10.110
Can you think of anyone that
your husband may have...

08:10.150 --> 08:11.617
wanted to harm?

08:11.650 --> 08:13.515
Someone he'd argued with?

08:13.560 --> 08:15.516
You don't know my husband.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.620
Talk to our neighbors,
our friends.

08:18.660 --> 08:20.150
He was a wonderful man.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.566
An hour before
the accident,

08:22.600 --> 08:27.162
he called me to
say he loved me.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.737
Did he give you
that necklace?

08:31.910 --> 08:34.174
We met at the church.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.178
Whatever you say

08:37.210 --> 08:40.008
my husband was,
that was the past.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.939
Finding God changed him.

08:42.990 --> 08:46.187
I see he got a medical
administration degree

08:46.220 --> 08:48.017
a year ago.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.324
MRS. BANIN:
It was our dream to open

08:50.360 --> 08:53.056
a senior care center.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.296
He had partners to help.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.924
We were finding investors.

08:58.970 --> 09:01.791
This was his life.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.809
Respectfully, Mrs. Banin...

09:05.840 --> 09:10.140
your husband was
a killer in Poland.

09:10.180 --> 09:13.149
A few days ago,
he killed again.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.977
When the one
that you love

09:15.020 --> 09:17.113
is revealed to
have a dark heart,

09:17.150 --> 09:20.256
it is...

09:20.290 --> 09:22.622
well, it's excruciating.

09:23.890 --> 09:27.121
I speak from experience.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.858
The shock will burn off.

09:36.770 --> 09:39.261
If there is anything
that you can tell us

09:39.310 --> 09:42.131
about who your husband
may have killed,

09:42.180 --> 09:44.273
helping us find
that person,

09:44.310 --> 09:49.145
that is an excellent way to
begin to repair yourself.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.748
I'm sorry.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.027
I cannot help you.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.650
HOLMES (lisping): This message
is for Travis Hardwick.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.167
This is Manny Tarkanian.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.294
I have a huge renovation;
it needs to move fast.

10:06.330 --> 10:08.890
I hear that you're
the best builder in Queens.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.408
I'm gonna text you
my contact information.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.307
Please... please get in touch.
Thank you.

10:14.340 --> 10:18.140
Who is Manny Tarkanian, and
why does he have a lisp?

10:18.180 --> 10:19.738
Childhood sledding accident.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.645
But let's not get caught up
in the backstory

10:21.680 --> 10:23.181
of a passing alias.
The question you should

10:23.220 --> 10:25.040
be asking is:
who is Travis Hardwick?

10:25.090 --> 10:26.216
I don't need to ask.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.059
You're gonna
tell me anyway.

10:28.090 --> 10:29.182
Let's begin
with two givens.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.188
Firstly, 76%
of all murder victims

10:31.230 --> 10:33.027
know their assailant.
We, as a speCIes,

10:33.060 --> 10:35.790
we tend to be killed
by the people closest to us--

10:35.830 --> 10:37.764
our friends, our spouses,
business associates.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.062
Secondly,

10:39.100 --> 10:42.661
it certainly appears
that Mr. Banin ne Andropov

10:42.710 --> 10:45.338
has resigned his position
as a contract killer,

10:45.370 --> 10:47.338
which makes it even more likely

10:47.380 --> 10:49.848
that the victim
is someone that he knew.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.713
These are bereavement cards,
notes from floral arrangements.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.809
You stole these
from Lara's house?
Hmm, yes.

10:54.850 --> 10:57.819
I was hoping
to ascertain which of
Leo's closest associates

10:57.850 --> 11:01.081
had failed to send
their condolences.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.918
Luckily for us, in this case,

11:03.960 --> 11:06.428
_ evidence of absence
is not absence of eVIdence.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.155
Okay, well, if one of his
friends didn't send a card,

11:08.200 --> 11:10.088
it might mean they're dead.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.291
But you don't even know who
his closest associates are.

11:12.330 --> 11:13.888
We know some of them.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.307
His partners
in the nursing home venture--

11:17.340 --> 11:19.934
all but one sent a note.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.141
Travis Hardwick.
It says here that

11:23.180 --> 11:25.774
he is a real estate developer,
but his online CV

11:25.810 --> 11:28.244
strongly suggests he is more
of a small-time contractor

11:28.280 --> 11:29.941
with very poor reviews.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.787
At present,
Mr. Hardwick is

11:31.820 --> 11:34.288
either very difficult
to reach or very dead.

11:35.790 --> 11:38.327
Well, it is 11:00--
it could be that

11:38.360 --> 11:41.090
he may be asleep rather
than in a shallow grave.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.860
I see. Locating this man is
obviously less important to you

11:43.900 --> 11:45.458
than whatever plans
you have this evening.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.990
Unlike you, I have
an official case.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.860
I'm going to the bar
where Jen met that guy.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.834
You're welcome to come.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.770
No. Your friend
would be better off

11:52.810 --> 11:54.437
employing a gigolo
than a private detective.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.142
She'd be amazed how cheaply
a night of anonymous abandon

11:57.180 --> 11:58.807
can be had.
Is she attractive?

11:58.850 --> 12:02.411
I might be able to provide
the service free of charge.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.145
No.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.909
*

12:11.330 --> 12:14.049
Can I get you
something?
Whiskey, neat.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.768
Hey, the guy at the door
said, um,

12:17.800 --> 12:19.427
you've been working here
the longest.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.529
(laughs) Only since birth;
it's my dad's place.

12:21.570 --> 12:23.504
Oh.
What's up?

12:23.540 --> 12:27.237
It's just a friend
of mine met a guy here
about a year ago, so...

12:27.280 --> 12:28.907
Oh, yeah. I think
I remember him.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.908
He likes alcoholic
beverages, right?

12:30.950 --> 12:32.872
Well, I was hoping
he might be a regular here.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.046
His name is Tony.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.411
He's a photojournalist.
Sorry.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.315
What's this all
about, anyway?

12:37.350 --> 12:39.181
Uh, nothing.

12:39.220 --> 12:41.450
Just-- it was a long shot.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.955
*

12:52.430 --> 12:54.398
Hey. Hey!

12:54.440 --> 12:57.068
Um, this place must be
pretty crazy on Brazilian Day,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.066
huh?
What, are you kidding?

12:59.110 --> 13:01.578
Little Brazil is pretty much
just this block, so, like,

13:01.610 --> 13:04.807
half the parade ends up in here
every year, and it's madness.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.818
Uh, thanks.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.408
Thanks. That's really helpful.

13:08.450 --> 13:10.816
SECRETARY:
Here it is.

13:10.850 --> 13:12.283
Hit play.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.517
You can see Leo followed
Travis to his truck that day.

13:15.560 --> 13:16.515
HOLMES:
Your boss' truck--

13:16.560 --> 13:17.822
does it have a LoJack?

13:17.860 --> 13:19.088
I don't think so.

13:19.130 --> 13:20.495
What is it you think
happened to Travis?

13:20.530 --> 13:22.418
We don't know that
anything happened to him.

13:22.460 --> 13:23.961
We just want
to make sure he's okay.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.490
SECRETARY:
Hey. I said you could come in

13:25.530 --> 13:26.838
and see the tape,

13:26.870 --> 13:27.859
not go through his stuff.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.265
If your boss is okay,

13:29.300 --> 13:31.029
I strongly suspect
that he will not notice

13:31.070 --> 13:33.106
his filing system
has been violated.

13:33.140 --> 13:34.232
So, unexpected three-day
absence from work--

13:34.280 --> 13:36.100
did you think
of calling the police?

13:36.140 --> 13:38.301
Clients are in here every month
bitching about something--

13:38.350 --> 13:40.511
the work's slow, there's
money missing, whatever.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.370
Travis pisses a lot
of people off.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.445
Leo was really scary
that day, but Travis

13:44.490 --> 13:46.378
kept saying, "It's under
control, it's under control."

13:46.420 --> 13:49.389
I didn't worry 'cause a little
while later he sent me a text,

13:49.420 --> 13:51.456
said he was headed
to Jersey.
WATSON:
Jersey?

13:51.490 --> 13:54.050
He has an uncle, lives out
in Newark; I figured he went

13:54.100 --> 13:55.397
to borrow more money--
it's happened before.

13:55.430 --> 13:57.068
Well, I'm not so sure
that he sent

13:57.100 --> 13:59.568
that text or that he even went
to New Jersey.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.136
(click, beep)

14:01.170 --> 14:03.138
"Pouring the
concrete today."

14:03.170 --> 14:06.537
Wait a second, did you
just read his lips?

14:06.570 --> 14:08.970
(sighs)

14:09.010 --> 14:12.002
(quietly):
The_ construction site of_Leo
Banin's nursmg care faCIlity.

14:12.050 --> 14:14.143
Difficult to imagine
a more ideal place

14:14.180 --> 14:18.947
to dispose of a body than
the foundation of a building.

14:30.230 --> 14:33.028
It's a shame, really--
the world will never know

14:35.640 --> 14:37.267
would look like.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.301
There's Travis' truck.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.448
HOLMES:
If he did leave here,

14:43.480 --> 14:46.074
he didn't use his own vehicle.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.442
So, if this is his
final resting place,

14:48.480 --> 14:51.085
I guess the question is,
where do we dig?

14:51.120 --> 14:53.111
We?
Us.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.186
The police.
Captain Gregson wants a body.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.696
Hey, you know what?
This might be something.

15:00.730 --> 15:03.699
The_ concrete over here
is a little darker.

15:03.730 --> 15:07.166
Could be they were working
construction overnight.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.931
Or it might mean that Leo
poured a fresh patch over here.

15:10.970 --> 15:13.530
Maybe Travis is
buried under it.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.472
No, we're wrong.

15:18.510 --> 15:20.114
Travis isn't here.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.610
(door creaks)

15:29.660 --> 15:31.127
Travis,

15:31.160 --> 15:32.149
you're alive.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.625
That's unfortunate.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.099
I just want to be
clear here, okay?

15:42.140 --> 15:44.005
You guys are not cops, right?

15:45.270 --> 15:48.137
(chuckling):
Oh, oh, man.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.000
I-I really thought
you were cops.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.278
I mean, the girls--

15:51.310 --> 15:52.971
they definitely
thought you were cops.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.976
So, you thought I was dead, huh?

15:55.020 --> 15:57.989
We just need to know
everything you can tell
us about Leo Banin,

15:58.020 --> 16:00.386
and then you can, um,
then you can resume
your activities.

16:00.420 --> 16:01.978
TRAVIS:
Oh, yeah, right.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.248
Right, Leo.

16:03.290 --> 16:04.552
You said he was dead.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.319
Poorguy,huh?

16:06.360 --> 16:08.749
So, how'd you guys know
I was in here, anyway?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.597
Actually, it was
a concert ticket.

16:10.630 --> 16:12.598
You had a stub
in the cab of your truck.

16:12.630 --> 16:13.665
The date and time
suggested that

16:13.700 --> 16:14.667
you survived
your visit from Leo.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.395
After the show,
you returned

16:16.440 --> 16:18.465
to the building site
and you haven't left since, and

16:18.510 --> 16:21.331
I know this because there are
no tracks behind your truck.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.631
It rained that night,
hasn't since.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.341
Aanay, you've been here

16:24.380 --> 16:25.779
snorting cocaine
and underwhelming

16:25.810 --> 16:27.778
a string of affordable
prostitutes ever since.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.447
Uh, I wouldn't say
underwhelming, pal.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.118
Your secretary
showed us a video

16:31.150 --> 16:33.311
of Leo confronting you
outside of your office.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.214
He seemed very angry.
Well, yeah,

16:35.260 --> 16:36.750
I just told him that
his nursing home

16:36.790 --> 16:38.678
was pretty much kaput;
we ran out of money.

16:38.730 --> 16:42.257
You don't appear to be
completely out of money.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.767
No, H was until Leo
pushed some on me,

16:43.800 --> 16:46.018
and I told him, 25 grand
wasn't gonna be enough

16:46.070 --> 16:47.765
to bail us out...
He gave you $25,000?

16:47.800 --> 16:49.597
Yeah. He said
he went to a loan shark.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.108
To tell you the truth,
I felt kind of bad taking it,

16:52.140 --> 16:53.801
'cause it wasn't gonna move
the needle-- but, hey,

16:53.840 --> 16:56.229
dog's got to eat, right?
So I figure live it up

16:56.280 --> 16:58.498
on St. Leo's dime,
party till Chapter 11, baby.

16:58.550 --> 17:01.178
Did he identify
the loan shark by name?

17:01.220 --> 17:03.541
No. What are you doing?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.808
We should leave this gentleman
to his after-party.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.386
Hey, that's
my money, pal.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.183
Actually, this is
Leo Banin's money.

17:09.220 --> 17:12.087
That cocaine, however,
that's entirely yours.

17:13.630 --> 17:16.190
"1-7-5-

17:16.230 --> 17:18.118
8-C."
Do you want to tell me

17:18.170 --> 17:20.331
why you're so sure that
this money was stolen?

17:20.370 --> 17:23.567
I mean, I know that Travis said
it came from a loan shark,

17:23.610 --> 17:26.067
but...
Look at it, Watson.

17:26.110 --> 17:27.737
What do you see?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.668
Well...

17:29.710 --> 17:33.271
all the bills
look pretty old.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.073
I mean, maybe
it's from the '905?

17:36.120 --> 17:38.088
$20 bills do not
last in circulation

17:38.120 --> 17:40.088
more_ than four
or five years.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.418
All of the money
Leo gave to Travis

17:42.460 --> 17:44.223
was at least
12 years old.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.148
One old bill,
that's a rarity;

17:46.190 --> 17:49.626
a stack of old 205
from a loan shark...

17:49.660 --> 17:52.663
astronomically unlikely to be
of legitimate provenance.

17:54.470 --> 17:56.461
You were right.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.333
My friend at the Bureau
says these bills were flagged.

17:59.370 --> 18:03.841
The cash you found was taken
in a bank robbery back in 2001.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.178
Looks like the guys
who did the job are still

18:06.210 --> 18:08.576
locked up at Otisville, but half
the cash was never recovered.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.383
We have reason to believe

18:10.420 --> 18:12.445
it was recently
distributed by
a loan shark.

18:12.490 --> 18:16.688
Well, Russell Gertz was a name
that kept popping up.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.325
Feds suspected the stolen cash
ended up with him.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.328
Couldn't make a case.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.590
Gertz is a moneylender,
used to run a book.

18:23.630 --> 18:25.518
Collared twice, never indicted.

18:25.570 --> 18:28.130
HOLMES:
Mr. Gertz is a cautious man--
waited over a decade

18:28.170 --> 18:30.809
before putting his dirty tender
out on the street.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.173
Or maybe Leo garroted
him and took it.

18:34.210 --> 18:37.600
You have an address
for this Mr. Gertz?
Not a current one.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.414
He's got a judgment
against him for unpaid
parking summonses.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.146
City marshals
can't find the guy.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.316
Hmm.

18:44.350 --> 18:45.715
It's official--

18:45.750 --> 18:47.411
I am superior in every way

18:47.460 --> 18:49.189
to the New York City Marshals.

18:49.220 --> 18:52.223
You figured out
where to find Gertz.

18:52.260 --> 18:54.899
Hi_s sister_Ida owns_ a
nail salon in BushWIck.

18:54.930 --> 18:57.228
Somehow the business
has managed to survwe

18:57.270 --> 18:58.862
for over 20 years,
despite being located

18:58.900 --> 19:01.232
in a heavily industrial
part of town.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.704
Not another
beauty-related business
in a ten-block radius.

19:03.740 --> 19:06.265
Well, sounds like a front.
Indeed.
What's that?

19:06.310 --> 19:07.834
I was able to get
a little traction

19:07.880 --> 19:09.768
on the thing I was
helping my friend with.

19:09.810 --> 19:11.448
The case of
the century?
Yeah.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.539
I mean, she met the guy
over Labor Day weekend,

19:13.580 --> 19:15.844
on the day of the
Brazilian Day parade.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.314
Okay, the place she met him
is, like, the heart

19:18.350 --> 19:20.784
of Little Brazil--
it would have been
wild that night. So...

19:20.820 --> 19:22.811
So you thought the local
news media might have footage

19:22.860 --> 19:25.249
from the bar that evening.
Yeah. Well,
you know, they love

19:25.290 --> 19:27.497
all that stuff--
celebrations and parades.
So I called Channel 3

19:27.530 --> 19:29.953
and I asked around,
and sure enough, they have
B-roll from that night.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.126
So if I'm lucky,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.559
Jen and her mystery man
are gonna be on it.
I'm sorry,

19:33.600 --> 19:35.488
I cannot indulge this
trifle any longer.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.360
We have a real case.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.834
Russell Gertz_'s nail_ salon_ cum
loan-sharking lair awaits.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.677
And I will_be there
in a minute.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.501
It was me.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.313
I slept with your friend--
ravaged, actually.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.545
I'm Tony.
I'm on that tape.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.354
She has a beauty mark here,
she has size six feet,

19:53.390 --> 19:55.312
she bites her nails and
thankfully nothing else.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.281
Sherlock...

20:00.360 --> 20:02.328
Sherlock...
It was a year ago.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.225
You had only recently
taken up residence here

20:04.270 --> 20:05.965
as my sober
companion.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.662
On those rare occasions that
you would allow me a few hours

20:08.700 --> 20:10.839
unchaperoned time,
I followed you.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.771
Usually you went jogging
or to the store.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.607
It was not a riveting
surveillance detail,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.801
I assure you.
But on one of those occasions,

20:17.850 --> 20:19.374
I saw you with Jennifer.

20:19.410 --> 20:21.275
Having gleaned little
about you to this point,

20:21.320 --> 20:22.844
I saw an opportunity, hmm?

20:22.880 --> 20:24.814
I waited until you'd gone,
and then I approached,

20:24.850 --> 20:26.545
as Tony from Long Island,
with the intention

20:26.590 --> 20:28.319
of steering the conversation
towards you.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.487
Now, we didn't end up
discussing you so much as...

20:30.530 --> 20:31.485
You seduced her.

20:31.530 --> 20:32.952
Actually, it was she

20:32.990 --> 20:34.298
who initiated
our dalliance.

20:34.330 --> 20:35.297
She's an aggressive and,

20:35.330 --> 20:36.456
I may say, limber woman,

20:36.500 --> 20:38.593
yourfnend.
It was good.

20:38.630 --> 20:41.463
Evidently, not as memorable
for me as it was for her...

20:41.500 --> 20:43.661
Enough, enough. I don't
even know where to begin.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.507
I mean, I guess we could start

20:45.540 --> 20:47.030
with the, the major
betrayal of trust

20:47.070 --> 20:49.675
that you just sort of
breezed past.

20:49.710 --> 20:52.008
You used to follow me?
It was not a breach of trust.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.870
We did not have this yet.
You were new.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.047
In order to allow you
into my confidence,

20:56.080 --> 20:58.719
I needed to get a sense of you.
Once I was satisfied

20:58.750 --> 21:00.718
your intentions
were sincere, I stopped.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.320
I have not_violated
your privacy Since. Hmm?

21:03.360 --> 21:05.578
And I...

21:05.630 --> 21:07.928
apologize.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.951
I was wasting my time,
and you knew it.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.695
You could've just told
me what you'd done

21:11.730 --> 21:12.719
when I told you
about the case.

21:12.770 --> 21:14.328
Okay, and you know what?

21:14.370 --> 21:16.565
Apologizing to me
isn't gonna fix this.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.737
There may well be
a dead loan shark

21:17.770 --> 21:19.567
waiting for us
in a Bushwick nail salon,

21:19.610 --> 21:21.339
so perhaps a solution
will present itself
on the way there.

21:22.910 --> 21:25.071
(door opens)

21:25.110 --> 21:27.442
Alive. Again.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.812
Why can't anyone
be dead today?

21:29.850 --> 21:32.444
Mr. Gertz, my name
is Sherlock Holmes.

21:32.490 --> 21:33.889
This is Dr. Joan Watson.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.354
We are consulting detectives
for the NYPD.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.725
Okay.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.751
That's an ugly bruising
on your arm.

21:42.030 --> 21:44.863
No ligature marks.
I thought perhaps he had

21:44.900 --> 21:46.561
survived an attack
from Leo Banin,

21:46.600 --> 21:47.999
but obviously you
were accosted by someone else.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.029
Leo who?

21:49.070 --> 21:50.469
WATSON :
You know Leo.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.330
You loaned him $25,000.

21:52.370 --> 21:54.736
Sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.647
You_want to ask me some
questions, you're gonna have

21:57.680 --> 22:00.103
to go back and get
some real cops.
HOLMES: Mm-hmm.

22:00.150 --> 22:02.744
You want us to do that so you
can empty out your autoclave.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.042
(Holmes laughs)

22:04.090 --> 22:05.978
Strangely, it's unplugged.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.784
Stranger still, it's been
fitted with a padlock.
I didn't realize

22:08.820 --> 22:10.629
that emery boards and
nail clippers were so valuable.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.389
Is that where you keep

22:12.430 --> 22:15.092
the money that you bought
from that bank job
back in 2001?

22:15.130 --> 22:17.519
Or are you smart enough
to keep it someplace
more remote?

22:17.570 --> 22:19.094
I've got a deal
for you, Mr. Gertz.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.064
Tell us everything you know
about Leo Banin,

22:21.100 --> 22:23.432
and I will not alert
the various sundry authorities

22:23.470 --> 22:25.438
who might be interested
in your whereabouts.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.478
Leo, uh...

22:31.510 --> 22:34.570
he took care of my mom
before she passed.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.110
He worked at the home.

22:36.150 --> 22:38.414
He was a bit preachy,
but a nice guy,

22:38.450 --> 22:40.714
at least until he learned
what I did, and then,

22:40.760 --> 22:42.614
of course, I was the devil.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.628
And yet he came to you
for a loan.

22:44.660 --> 22:47.151
Ah, he needed 50 grand
to put the nursing home

22:47.190 --> 22:48.999
back on track.
He had no collateral,

22:49.030 --> 22:51.419
so I gave him 25 grand
on the arm.

22:51.470 --> 22:54.633
On account of the fact
that he was nice to my mom.

22:54.670 --> 22:56.888
Now you know
what I know.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.635
Well, I-I disagree.

22:58.670 --> 23:01.400
We still don't know how you
sustained those wounds.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.442
I fell.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.539
I have vertigo.

23:05.580 --> 23:09.016
Ah. Why don't you go and get
a piece of pen and paper,

23:09.050 --> 23:10.642
so you can make some notes,

23:10.690 --> 23:12.487
so you can keep
your story straight

23:12.520 --> 23:14.078
for when you're in custody?

23:17.790 --> 23:20.657
All right, just hold on,
hold on, hold on.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.691
A couple days after
Leo showed up,

23:22.730 --> 23:26.496
I got a visit from
a guy named...

23:26.530 --> 23:28.691
Grigori Andrev.

23:29.870 --> 23:31.701
He's Bratva.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.833
The Russian mob was here?

23:33.880 --> 23:37.702
Grigori knew that I
had loaned Leo money.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.570
Don't ask me how.

23:39.610 --> 23:42.579
You, uh, deal off the books,
it's like a small town,

23:42.620 --> 23:45.919
and he wanted me to help him
track Leo down for him.

23:45.950 --> 23:48.783
Uh, I didn't think it
was such a nice thing

23:48.820 --> 23:51.584
to put the Russian mob
on one of my clients.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.952
So you resisted, and he
threatened to break your arm.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.093
Uh,

23:57.130 --> 24:00.566
turns out I didn't have
anything more than...

24:00.600 --> 24:02.465
what he already knew.

24:03.970 --> 24:06.507
He knew Leo's
home address,

24:06.540 --> 24:09.077
he... his phone,
everything.

24:09.110 --> 24:11.078
I got my arm mangled

24:11.110 --> 24:14.113
for absolutely nothing.

24:15.650 --> 24:18.539
That's the whole story.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.884
Uh, y-you ain't gonna
tell the cops, are you?

24:22.920 --> 24:26.686
RUSSELL: You are gonna keep
your word, aren't you?

24:26.730 --> 24:29.198
Sherlock Holmes
for Detective Bell.
I don't really

24:29.230 --> 24:31.494
have a problem
with you violating
that creep's trust,

24:31.530 --> 24:34.567
but I would have thought
you'd at least given him
a-a running start.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.898
I'm not calling about him,
I'm calling about Leo Banin.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.805
Gertz just told us that
the Rukovskaya Bratva

24:38.840 --> 24:40.535
came here cracking heads,
looking for Leo.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.036
A few hours later,
he was dead.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.672
Even if you do believe
in coincidences,

24:43.710 --> 24:45.075
that one strains
credulity, does it not?

24:45.110 --> 24:47.715
Why would the Bratva want
to kill one of their own?

24:47.750 --> 24:50.241
He wasn't one of
their own, hadn't been
for quite some time.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.784
Well, coincidence or not,
Leo's motorcycle crash
was ruled an accident.

24:53.820 --> 24:56.254
I think it's time we looked
at that crash site ourselves.

24:56.290 --> 24:58.724
Taxi!
And this time,
we should get some proper help.

25:03.100 --> 25:05.660
(indistinct radio transmission)

25:08.240 --> 25:10.902
Hope you got something good,

25:10.940 --> 25:13.135
dragging half
the precinct out here.

25:13.170 --> 25:15.229
BELL:
Apparently Leo's old
friends in the Bratva

25:15.280 --> 25:17.578
found out he was
hiding in New York.

25:17.610 --> 25:20.738
Pretty sure they chose this
spot for an unhappy reunion.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.783
Found a couple of these,
just over there.

25:23.820 --> 25:25.310
The tobacco is
an admixture

25:25.350 --> 25:27.215
most commonly found
in counterfeit cigarettes

25:27.250 --> 25:29.559
produced in Moscow.
Whoever smoked these

25:29.590 --> 25:31.820
left more than just
cigarettes. These are

25:31.860 --> 25:33.555
from a .45.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.023
We talked to a loan shark
that Leo borrowed money from.

25:36.060 --> 25:39.063
He told us that a Bratva soldier
by the name of Grigori Andrev

25:39.100 --> 25:40.590
came looking for him.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.267
We think he was the one
who left these.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.666
There are some motorcycle tracks
just over there to indicate

25:44.710 --> 25:46.268
Leo Banin left the scene
in a hurry.

25:46.310 --> 25:48.232
You would, too,
if Grigori Andrev was

25:48.280 --> 25:52.705
shooting at you.
What the hell was Leo Banin
domg way out here?

25:52.750 --> 25:54.274
We're not sure yet,
but the headline is,

25:54.320 --> 25:56.072
the crash that killed
him and the driver

25:56.120 --> 25:57.849
of the other vehicle
was no aCCIdent.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.744
The highway patrol-- they
didn't conduct a search

25:59.790 --> 26:01.212
this far back--

26:01.260 --> 26:02.682
there was no
apparent reason to.

26:02.720 --> 26:03.880
So they missed
these casings.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.249
They also missed
the bullets lodged

26:05.290 --> 26:07.827
in the telegraph pole
and fence over there.

26:07.860 --> 26:11.125
Now, the shots must have
caused Leo Banin to swerve

26:11.170 --> 26:13.991
mmamme
killing someone.
You know how

26:14.040 --> 26:16.600
the_ Bratva like to rotate
their players after a job.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.267
We put the BOLO
for Andrev out wide,

26:18.310 --> 26:20.733
tristate and Chicago.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.271
GREGSON:
Wanted on suspicion

26:25.910 --> 26:27.775
and a Melissa Aguire,
the other driver.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.687
MAN:
Hey, I got something!

26:35.090 --> 26:38.150
HOLMES:
Grigori Andrev.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.885
He's the one
Leo strangled.

26:39.930 --> 26:43.195
I guess you can
cancel this.

26:43.230 --> 26:46.620
Last time I checked, dead men
couldn't pull triggers.

26:46.670 --> 26:49.935
GREGSON:
So, if he didn't shoot
at Leo Banin, who did?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.944
(insects buzzing loudly)

27:04.720 --> 27:06.779
(buzzing continues)

27:11.460 --> 27:12.984
That's a little loud.

27:13.030 --> 27:15.828
You know?

27:17.330 --> 27:19.423
(buzzing stops)

27:19.470 --> 27:21.335
Studies have consistently
shown that changes

27:21.370 --> 27:23.759
in one's surroundings,
background noise,

27:23.810 --> 27:25.903
even the angle from which
materials are viewed,

27:25.940 --> 27:27.828
can result in fresh insights.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.371
That was background
noise to you, huh?

27:30.410 --> 27:31.946
Were you able to reach
the Warsaw police?

27:31.980 --> 27:33.345
Yes.

27:33.380 --> 27:36.747
And I got a pretty good
idea why Vitaly Andropov

27:36.780 --> 27:39.044
changed his name
to Leo Banin

27:39.090 --> 27:42.082
and left Poland
in 2005-- he stole

27:42.120 --> 27:45.089
100,000 zlotys from
his Bratvian buddies.

27:45.130 --> 27:48.293
That's about 30
grand American,
give or take.

27:48.330 --> 27:51.060
Well, perhaps his past caught up
with him the other day.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.761
Anything from ballistics
of note?

27:52.800 --> 27:56.691
Not exactly what
we were hoping for.

27:56.740 --> 27:58.002
Those .45-caliber slugs

27:58.040 --> 28:01.908
taken from the scene
match perfectly to bullets

28:01.940 --> 28:04.079
that we pulled out
of a RICO witness

28:04.110 --> 28:06.271
last year-- the guy
was about to testify

28:06.310 --> 28:08.016
against the Russians.

28:08.050 --> 28:11.144
Rumor had it that Grigori
Andrev was the triggerman.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.715
But he was_ not the_ shooter
on this occa5ion.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.149
Unless you think

28:16.190 --> 28:18.420
he was doing target practice
before Banin

28:18.460 --> 28:22.123
garroted him.
No. The shots caused the crash,

28:22.160 --> 28:26.096
so they must have been ﬁred
after Andrev's strangulation

28:26.130 --> 28:27.961
as Leo fled the scene.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.901
Some third party must have
picked up the weapon and fired

28:30.940 --> 28:33.158
at Leo's motorcycle
as it sped away.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.768
Shots went wide,

28:34.810 --> 28:37.028
but they caused him
to swerve and crash.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.969
Is Joan up to speed
on all this?

28:40.010 --> 28:42.171
She's gone with
Detective Bell...

28:42.220 --> 28:44.108
to visit the Good Widow Banin

28:44.150 --> 28:47.517
and explain the true
circumstances of her
husband's death.

28:47.550 --> 28:50.189
So, the man
whose body you found,

28:50.220 --> 28:53.280
you believe he was trying
to hurt Leo?

28:53.330 --> 28:54.922
Him and a partner, yeah.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.190
We have reason to believe
that they were part

28:57.230 --> 29:00.028
of the same organization
your husband used to work for.

29:00.070 --> 29:01.389
This idea

29:01.440 --> 29:05.308
that Leo killed someone
right before...

29:05.340 --> 29:08.275
it's been so hard to live with.

29:08.310 --> 29:11.848
I tried to pray
for his soul, but...

29:11.880 --> 29:13.074
your partner

29:13.110 --> 29:14.475
turned out to be right.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.078
I couldn't forgive Leo

29:16.120 --> 29:20.147
for abandoning our faith.

29:20.190 --> 29:25.025
But now you say it
was self-defense.

29:25.060 --> 29:28.393
(sighs)
It's a relief.

29:30.330 --> 29:31.490
(clears throat)

29:31.530 --> 29:33.225
(phone ringing)

29:33.270 --> 29:34.532
(sighs)

29:36.070 --> 29:38.038
Dr. Hawes, anything to report?

29:38.070 --> 29:40.538
The garrote wound is exactly
as thick as the cuts

29:40.570 --> 29:42.504
on Leo Banin's hands.

29:42.540 --> 29:45.043
Wire from earphone buds,
ifI had to guess.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.377
And?

29:46.410 --> 29:48.310
The initial toxicology report
came back.

29:48.350 --> 29:51.148
It's interesting-- the deceased
was on a carefully managed

29:51.190 --> 29:53.988
mixture of anti-anxiety
and heart meds.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.908
Thing is, you don't just

29:55.960 --> 29:58.428
take a handful of fluoxetine
and a few ACE inhibitors

29:58.460 --> 29:59.927
and hope for the best.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.427
These are medications

30:01.460 --> 30:03.997
that can only coexist
in a delicate balance.

30:04.030 --> 30:06.419
Are you saying that Mr. Andrev
must have had a psychiatrist?

30:06.470 --> 30:08.529
Figured you might want
to track him or her down,

30:08.570 --> 30:10.299
see if they know
any of the names

30:10.340 --> 30:12.160
of the people he worked with--
any luck,

30:12.210 --> 30:13.529
maybe you'll even find
your shooter.

30:13.570 --> 30:16.175
(elevator bell dings)

30:16.210 --> 30:18.440
(phone ringing)
Sorry, Dr. Glassman
is still on a call.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.300
He may be a while.

30:20.350 --> 30:22.272
He understands we are part of
a police investigation, right?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.185
Dr. Glassman's office.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.142
Are you sure this
is the doctor

30:26.190 --> 30:28.078
that wrote the
fluoxetine scrip

30:28.120 --> 30:31.157
for Grigori Andrev?
Captain Gregson sent men
to Andrev's home.

30:31.190 --> 30:33.454
I'm told that Dr. Glassman's
name was clearly legible

30:33.490 --> 30:36.152
on his pill bottles.
Oh. I'm supposed
to meet Jen.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.929
I'm gonna have
to reschedule now.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.063
You spoke to her?

30:40.100 --> 30:42.239
About you? No.
This is not the kind of news

30:42.270 --> 30:43.362
you break over the phone.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.401
He may have died, you know.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.474
Tony.

30:49.510 --> 30:52.047
Knowing him,
it was something quite heroic.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.947
RECEPTIONIST:
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
but Dr. Glassman

30:54.980 --> 30:57.210
has an appointment
with a patient in five minutes.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.389
Maybe you could come back
in an hour?

30:59.420 --> 31:01.513
No, I'm afraid I cannot;
I will be dead by then.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.448
What?
I've been feeling a bit down;
I'm thinking

31:03.490 --> 31:04.957
of taking my own life posthaste.

31:04.990 --> 31:07.550
Ms. Watson here is
beside herself about it.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.899
Does that window open?

31:11.470 --> 31:14.894
I'm required by law to take you
back to see the doctor

31:14.940 --> 31:16.635
if you make a threat like that.

31:16.670 --> 31:20.561
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

31:24.210 --> 31:26.178
GLASSMAN:
Mr. Holmes, is it?

31:26.210 --> 31:28.474
You're a police consultant?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.943
Mm-hmm. This is my
partner, Joan Watson,

31:30.990 --> 31:33.481
and I'm pleased to say
she's just successfully
treated my depression.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.657
Oh, that's wonderful news.

31:34.690 --> 31:36.578
That means that
you can leave now.

31:36.620 --> 31:38.679
I apologize for lying, but
time is of the essence.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.449
We are in pursuit of a
member of a dangerous
criminal syndicate,

31:41.500 --> 31:45.425
the Rukovskaya Bratva.
You treated one of them:
Grigori Andrev.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.392
(quiet chuckle)
You're smart enough to know

31:47.430 --> 31:50.092
that threatening suicide
would get you in here;

31:50.140 --> 31:52.108
you're certainly smart enough
to know that

31:52.140 --> 31:56.031
doctor-patient confidentiality
prevents me from discussing...

31:56.080 --> 31:57.502
Any living patients,
yes, we know.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.371
But this one is dead.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.071
Strangled
by a male nurse

32:01.120 --> 32:03.076
he was attempting
to assassinate.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.680
What?

32:05.720 --> 32:10.555
Surely you're well acquainted
with Mr. Andrev's sociopathy.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.421
You must have half expected
this day to come.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.553
Dr. Glassman, we know
that you treated him.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.227
Your name is

32:16.260 --> 32:17.989
on the fluoxetine scrip.

32:18.030 --> 32:20.419
You have an obligation
to waive privilege
when there is

32:20.470 --> 32:24.429
legitimate concern
about a client's
criminal actIVIty.

32:24.470 --> 32:26.438
I'm-I'm sorry.

32:26.470 --> 32:28.677
I, uh... (chuckles)

32:28.710 --> 32:31.247
I didn't want to treat Grigori.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.043
He just showed up one day

32:33.080 --> 32:35.719
and said he had problems.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.685
When I realized what he was
and who he worked for,

32:38.720 --> 32:41.280
H was just
too afraid
to cut ties.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.254
He was very careful
about what he said here.

32:43.290 --> 32:47.283
He didn't discuss any of the
particulars about his work.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.548
But... there was one name

32:49.600 --> 32:53.092
that-that just came up
multiple times.

32:54.370 --> 32:56.065
Um, Marko Zubkov.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.439
I gathered that
he was Grigori's

32:59.470 --> 33:02.735
right hand for certain...

33:02.780 --> 33:04.645
jobs.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.373
You guys squared away
around back?

33:08.420 --> 33:10.570
We're just questioning
the guy, right?

33:10.620 --> 33:13.384
Is all of this
really necessary?
Well, you saw his sheet:

33:13.420 --> 33:16.287
extortion, racketeering,
three unsolved disappearances.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.220
Marko Zubkov deserves
the full treatment.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.421
He's what we call
a "bad guy."

33:20.460 --> 33:22.325
I don't know why
you're complaining.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.362
You make it work.

33:33.370 --> 33:35.076
Sasha Zubkov?

33:35.110 --> 33:37.305
NYPD. We're here for Marko.

33:42.620 --> 33:44.212
(TV Playing)

33:44.250 --> 33:46.480
Marko, you look cozy.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.351
Can I see that hand?

33:48.390 --> 33:50.119
(TV clicks off)

33:50.160 --> 33:51.627
What is this?

33:51.660 --> 33:53.719
It's a murder investigation.
A man you knew

33:53.760 --> 33:55.728
as Vitaly Andropov.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.228
Where were you
three nights ago?

33:58.270 --> 33:59.567
Sunday night?

33:59.600 --> 34:01.739
I'd rather not relive it.

34:01.770 --> 34:03.328
You're gonna have to.

34:03.370 --> 34:05.429
If not here,
then at the station.

34:05.470 --> 34:07.768
(clicks tongue)
Impossible.

34:07.810 --> 34:11.246
The doctors say
I'm not supposed to walk.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.645
What doctors?

34:12.680 --> 34:15.410
The ones who operated on me.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.581
You wanted to know
where I was Sunday night?

34:19.620 --> 34:21.383
I was in a hospital.

34:21.420 --> 34:25.254
Because Saturday night I was
mugged by a guy with a knife.

34:25.290 --> 34:27.349
I lunged for the bastard,

34:27.390 --> 34:29.096
he stabbed me twice.

34:29.130 --> 34:31.792
If you don't believe me,
please call the hospital.

34:31.830 --> 34:33.661
They'll tell you.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.294
I was there the whole time.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.514
(door opens)

34:52.550 --> 34:54.882
How did it go at the hospital?

34:54.920 --> 34:56.387
Well, Zubkov's story checks out.

34:56.420 --> 34:58.524
Three nights ago,
he limped into the ER.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.289
with two stab wounds to his leg

35:00.330 --> 35:02.252
and a tourniquet
tied just below his groin

35:02.300 --> 35:04.222
to stop some serious bleeding
from his femoral.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.363
Claimed he was mugged.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.231
What about the police report?

35:08.270 --> 35:10.636
There was not much to it.
Cops who came took a statement

35:10.670 --> 35:12.365
and a couple of pictures
of the wound.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.332
Zubkov didn't check out
until last night.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.473
How's it going here?

35:16.510 --> 35:19.206
There are over 70 men
with Bratva ties

35:19.250 --> 35:20.842
in the NYPD's photo
manager system.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.348
Those are only the ones
who've been arrested.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.519
The real number of Bratva men
in the tristate area

35:25.550 --> 35:27.711
would be difficult
to apprOXImate.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.787
The man who shot at Leo the
night of his deadly accident

35:30.820 --> 35:32.378
might not even be here.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.591
(sighs) Okay, that is...

35:34.630 --> 35:36.393
depressing enough for me.

35:36.430 --> 35:38.398
I'm gonna go to bed.

35:38.430 --> 35:42.469
Have you given any more thought
to the "dead Tony" idea?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.661
Okay, that is not an idea.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.666
That is just another lie.

35:46.710 --> 35:48.769
While I detest nothing more
than willful ignorance,

35:48.810 --> 35:50.937
I have come to believe
that in certain matters,

35:50.980 --> 35:52.868
ignorance bestowed
can be a gift.

35:52.910 --> 35:55.470
Your friend Jan-- she
seemed like a nice person.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.545
She deserves neither
shame nor heartbreak.

35:57.580 --> 36:00.481
Okay, first of all,
her name is Jen, not Jan.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.919
And regarding
shame and heartbreak,

36:01.960 --> 36:04.258
you should have
thought of that a year ago.

36:07.260 --> 36:09.399
You're quite certain
someone with Zubkov's injuries

36:09.430 --> 36:10.795
couldn't have snuck
out of the hospital

36:10.830 --> 36:12.798
for just a few hours?
Not without starting up

36:12.830 --> 36:14.536
the bleeding again
and not without being seen.

36:14.570 --> 36:16.492
Wouldn't be the first person
to sneak undetected

36:16.540 --> 36:18.735
from a hospital--
I've done it myself.

36:18.770 --> 36:21.637
Yeah. Well, you have
never had injuries

36:21.680 --> 36:23.568
like that.
Mm.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.271
This is the tourniquet?
Yeah.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.914
Probably saved
his life.

36:28.950 --> 36:32.283
We've been operating
under a misconception.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.652
I think it's possible
that the attack on Leo

36:34.690 --> 36:37.716
was not the first attempt
the Bratva made on his life,

36:37.760 --> 36:39.284
but the second.

36:40.290 --> 36:41.826
If I'm right...

36:41.860 --> 36:44.522
I may also know
who shot at him that night.

36:45.700 --> 36:47.520
GREGSON:
Thank you
for waiting,

36:47.570 --> 36:49.788
Mrs. Banin-- I know you've
been here quite a while.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.899
I owe you
more than patience.

36:51.940 --> 36:54.272
Your officers have
been very kind to me.

36:54.310 --> 36:56.505
They said you had
some questions.

36:56.540 --> 36:58.508
HOLMES:
We do.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.869
(sighs)

36:59.910 --> 37:01.309
All right.

37:01.350 --> 37:02.840
(clears throat)

37:02.880 --> 37:06.316
Is this... a man?

37:06.350 --> 37:08.557
Obviously it is a man.

37:08.590 --> 37:09.818
Good.

37:09.860 --> 37:12.658
Does he have a nose?

37:12.690 --> 37:14.419
Yes.

37:14.460 --> 37:16.599
Excellent.

37:18.830 --> 37:21.936
I don't understand.
Who was that?

37:21.970 --> 37:24.438
Why did you
show me his picture?

37:24.470 --> 37:26.563
Oh, come on,
you know Marko Zubkov.

37:26.610 --> 37:30.330
You saved his life when
he tried to kill your husband.

37:30.380 --> 37:33.543
(sighs) Do you
recognize... that?

37:33.580 --> 37:36.674
It's the tourniquet
you tied around Marko's
leg after Leo stabbed it.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.314
You know how we know?
Because of the fabric.

37:39.350 --> 37:41.352
It's the same as the drapes
in your living room.

37:41.390 --> 37:44.985
HOLMES:
We've been wondering
how the Bratva found Leo

37:45.030 --> 37:46.986
after so many years in hiding;
turns out the answer

37:47.030 --> 37:49.453
was right in front of us--
you told them where he was.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.024
You let Mr. Zubkov
into your home

37:51.060 --> 37:52.994
before you left
the other day,

37:53.030 --> 37:56.466
so he could lie in wait.
This was Saturday,
before the accident.

37:56.500 --> 37:59.469
HOLMES: Only Leo
turned out to be quite
formidable, didn't he?

37:59.510 --> 38:01.728
He was much more than
Mr. Zubkov could handle,

38:01.780 --> 38:03.600
even with the_ element
of surprise.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.870
Leo fought him off,
stabbed him in the leg,

38:05.910 --> 38:07.446
and fled.
You came home,

38:07.480 --> 38:09.016
expecting to find
a dead husband.

38:09.050 --> 38:11.018
Instead, you
find a mobster

38:11.050 --> 38:12.688
bleeding to death
on your floor.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.359
GREGSON:
The tourniquet you
rigged up from your drapes

38:15.390 --> 38:17.085
saved his life,
so congrats.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.985
You told us your
husband called you

38:19.030 --> 38:21.021
shortly before he died,
only it wasn't to tell you

38:21.060 --> 38:23.893
that he loved you-- it
was to tell you that
he'd been attacked,

38:23.930 --> 38:26.421
it wasn't safe, and to
meet him in Far Rockaway.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.665
HOLMES:
So you hatched a plan
with Grigori Andrev.

38:28.700 --> 38:32.830
He would get there
first, lie in wait,
you would meet with Leo,

38:32.870 --> 38:35.600
you distract him,
so that Andrev
could attack him.

38:35.640 --> 38:40.077
Must have shocked you to see
your husband in action,
dispensing with Andrev.

38:40.110 --> 38:43.443
Shocked and scared you,
'cause now he knows
that you're in on it.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.981
So you don't have a choice.

38:45.020 --> 38:47.989
As Leo flees...
you picked up Andrev's gun.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.510
WATSON :
You missed,

38:49.560 --> 38:50.982
but the shots fired
were enough

38:51.020 --> 38:53.659
to cause the crash and
kill an innocent woman.

38:53.690 --> 38:55.351
This is an outrage.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.992
I loved my husband.

38:57.030 --> 39:00.067
That man out there--
I've never seen_ him
before in my life.

39:00.100 --> 39:03.536
Right. So you won't
mind that he just saw you
looking at a picture of him,

39:03.570 --> 39:05.629
nodding in the affirmative to
questions posed by the police.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.401
Why are you doing this to me?

39:09.440 --> 39:11.943
Why do you try
to get me in trouble?

39:11.980 --> 39:14.073
The reason we had you waiting
so long this morning

39:14.110 --> 39:16.544
is because we needed time
to search your home.

39:16.580 --> 39:18.548
We got a warrant--
we found the evidence

39:18.590 --> 39:20.012
for the attack
on your husband.

39:20.050 --> 39:22.553
Bullet holes
in your wall

39:22.590 --> 39:24.080
and bloodstains
on your carpet.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.556
You covered the bullet holes
up With pictures, but...

39:27.590 --> 39:29.490
the bloodstains,
you missed a bit.

39:29.530 --> 39:32.795
No. If what you say is true,
there was an attack,

39:32.830 --> 39:35.663
these men, these mobsters,
they cleaned it.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.497
Oh, I'm sorry,

39:37.540 --> 39:40.464
they hung new stuff on your
walls and you didn't notice?

39:42.580 --> 39:45.777
You can either keep lying to us,

39:45.810 --> 39:47.778
or you give us Zubkov.

39:47.810 --> 39:49.949
You don't, we're
gonna let you both go,

39:49.980 --> 39:51.789
and we're just
gonna build our case.

39:51.820 --> 39:55.881
You can take your chances
with the Bratva on the outside.

40:01.160 --> 40:04.789
Leo had his secrets,

40:04.830 --> 40:07.469
but I knew enough; I forgave.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.832
That's what we are taught to do.

40:09.870 --> 40:11.599
But not him.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.063
He couldn't forgive
when he found out

40:14.110 --> 40:16.738
what brought me
to the church.

40:18.510 --> 40:20.842
I needed money when I was young.

40:22.650 --> 40:24.015
movies.

40:24.050 --> 40:27.087
To pay to come
to America,

40:27.120 --> 40:28.758
I had to.

40:28.790 --> 40:31.486
One of his friends,
he saw these films,

40:31.530 --> 40:33.680
and then...

40:33.730 --> 40:35.618
it was over.

40:35.660 --> 40:38.493
Leo asked me for a divorce.

40:38.530 --> 40:42.569
We put every penny
into that nursing home,

40:42.600 --> 40:46.036
and now he's
gomg to leave?

40:46.070 --> 40:48.061
And I will have nothing?

40:49.810 --> 40:51.641
No.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.514
I knew there was a price
on his head,

40:55.550 --> 40:59.088
so... I made the call.

41:00.820 --> 41:03.550
Hi.
Hey.

41:05.690 --> 41:07.920
Sherlock told me everything.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.520
Wha...? H-He came
to see you?

41:10.560 --> 41:12.198
Earlier today.

41:12.230 --> 41:14.562
He apologized,
and he made it

41:14.600 --> 41:18.661
very clear that you had
no idea what he'd done
until the other day.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.063
I was really impressed,
by they way--

41:20.110 --> 41:22.078
the way you tracked him down,
finding that footage...

41:22.110 --> 41:25.102
Jen, I know that you thought
he was the one, but...

41:25.150 --> 41:27.277
No, no, no, Joan,
it's okay. Seriously.

41:27.310 --> 41:30.541
I-I... appreciate you
getting to the bottom of it,

41:30.580 --> 41:33.287
but I...
I have closure now.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.811
It happened again.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.748
You slept with him.

41:37.790 --> 41:40.020
What? No.

41:40.060 --> 41:42.699
Yes. You are_ such
a terrible liar!

41:42.730 --> 41:45.096
(sighs) Okay, I guess
this is what I get,

41:45.130 --> 41:47.098
being friends
with a detective.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.588
He just was so sweet
about everything

41:50.640 --> 41:53.029
and making sure that things
were right between you and me

41:53.070 --> 41:55.573
and telling the truth...
And getting in your pants.

41:55.610 --> 41:58.579
Actually...
I came on to him.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.771
But here's the good news.

42:00.810 --> 42:05.144
Now I know it_ was
totally superfICIal.

42:05.190 --> 42:09.149
That guy is completely
out of my system.

42:10.660 --> 42:13.185
(door closes)

42:13.230 --> 42:15.198
Well, you were
right, Watson.

42:15.230 --> 42:17.289
Honesty-- unquestionably
the best policy.

42:17.330 --> 42:19.662
I want you to know I
think it's really great,

42:19.700 --> 42:22.931
you doing what you did
today for Jen, so she
can finally have a baby--

42:22.970 --> 42:25.006
I don't think I've ever
seen her so happy.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.668
She did tell you
she was ovulating, right?

42:31.680 --> 42:34.103
I almost had you.

42:34.150 --> 42:35.845
Yes, almost.
