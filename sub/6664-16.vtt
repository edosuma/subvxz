WEBVTT

00:00.266 --> 00:02.501
Adult adam: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> my mom forced us to take</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:06.505
<i> The most embarrassing</i>
<i> family photos</i>
<i> in human history.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:07.940
<i> Did we agree</i>
<i> because we loved her?</i>

00:07.942 --> 00:11.143
<i> Oh, god, no. We did it</i>
<i> 'cause she guilted us.</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:12.978
This is
so brutal.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.446
But one day,
when you abandon me

00:14.448 --> 00:16.482
In an old-age home
and never visit,

00:16.484 --> 00:17.683
You'll look
at these pictures

00:17.685 --> 00:19.184
And remember
how much I loved you.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.120
Now, everybody
say <i> mahalo.</i>

00:21.122 --> 00:22.154
All: <i> Mahalo!</i>

00:22.156 --> 00:24.390
<i> And her guilting wasn't</i>
<i> just for family photos.</i>

00:24.392 --> 00:26.492
<i> It was for family everything.</i>

00:26.494 --> 00:27.860
Baby, if you don't eat,

00:27.862 --> 00:29.595
Then I have failed
as a mother.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.998
I'm gonna die one day,
but have fun
with your friends.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.434
When I die,
don't have a funeral.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.002
I don't want to take up
anybody's time.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.538
<i> And then there was</i>
<i> her signature guilt move.</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:41.540
<i> If we were driving,</i>
<i> and she didn't get her way,</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:44.943
<i> She'd jump out of the car</i>
<i> and threaten to walk home.</i>

00:44.945 --> 00:46.078
Get back in the car,
mom!

00:46.080 --> 00:49.515
We want to have a picnic
with you, okay?
Barry: Yeah!

00:49.517 --> 00:52.818
I'm so stoked to eat
chicken salad on the ground!

00:52.820 --> 00:56.121
Well, if that's what you want,
then...Yay! Picnic!

00:56.123 --> 00:59.224
<i> Yep. It was her guilt world,</i>
<i> and we were just living in it.</i>

00:59.226 --> 01:00.192
Hey, where are
the car keys?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.260
We're gonna grab a bite
before the movie.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.430
Movie? I thought
we had plans
to bedazzle all day.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.131
I think you might have
dreamed that.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.500
Well, it's possible,
but we're all set up,

01:08.502 --> 01:11.637
So let's make those
drab clothes sparkle, huh?

01:11.639 --> 01:14.440
Oh, no. What is that?
Oh, my god!

01:14.442 --> 01:15.441
It's a harlequin clown

01:15.443 --> 01:18.143
Riding a unicorn
high fiving a dolphin. Duh!

01:18.145 --> 01:21.280
Yeah, I think
we're gonna pass
on the debazzler.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.948
Okay, now you're just
embarrassing yourself.

01:22.950 --> 01:27.820
It's bedazzler,
as in regular items
become dazzled.

01:27.822 --> 01:30.055
(scoffs)
and if you don't
wanna do that,

01:30.057 --> 01:31.723
I'll just join you
at the movie.

01:31.725 --> 01:32.391
No way!
Oh, my god!

01:32.393 --> 01:35.427
Come on. I hardly ever
get to see you anymore,

01:35.429 --> 01:38.030
And you're both
growing up so fast, and...

01:38.032 --> 01:40.566
You did promise
we'd spend the day together.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.668
Again, that was a dream.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.269
(sighs)
it'll be fun.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.505
Afterwards,
we can grab a bite,

01:46.507 --> 01:47.706
Split a giant cookie,

01:47.708 --> 01:49.074
You can ride
the little mall train

01:49.076 --> 01:50.909
If you're still into it.
Ain't no thang.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.946
Okay, here is the thang.
No.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.014
Wow. I am being rejected
by two people

01:56.016 --> 02:00.352
Who were tethered
to my body for nine months
by a food cord.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.454
(sighs)
that's right.
Everything I ate,

02:02.456 --> 02:05.357
You got a tiny,
mushed-up version of.
Everything!

02:05.359 --> 02:07.559
I don't think
that's how
science works.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.560
You know what? Go.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.062
I'm not even sad.
I'm great.

02:10.064 --> 02:13.432
Aw, come on.
Not the little
pack of tissues!

02:13.434 --> 02:15.968
Barry: Mom tears are
the worst tears ever!

02:15.970 --> 02:18.003
Fine. Well,
if we have no choice...

02:18.005 --> 02:21.073
Oh, that's so sweet!
And don't you worry.

02:21.075 --> 02:23.909
I promise you won't even
notice I'm there.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.712
Hey, check out
my new jacket.

02:27.847 --> 02:30.215
Oh, no!
Oh, my god!

02:31.451 --> 02:32.784
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:32.786 --> 02:37.189
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:39.058 --> 02:40.159
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:40.161 --> 02:44.363
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:44.365 --> 02:46.231
Adult adam: <i> It was</i>
<i> may 11, 1980, something,</i>

02:46.233 --> 02:47.699
<i> And my dad was pumped</i>
<i> to spend the day</i>

02:47.701 --> 02:50.836
<i> With his one true love...</i>
<i> The phillies.</i>

02:50.838 --> 02:52.704
Hello, wonderful family,

02:52.706 --> 02:55.841
Who I'm not gonna
be seeing for the next

02:55.843 --> 02:58.277
Six glorious hours!

02:58.279 --> 02:59.178
Wait.
Where are you going?

02:59.180 --> 03:00.479
To the phillies game
with vic.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.915
You never told me that.
Did you mark it
in the calendar?

03:02.917 --> 03:05.384
You have a calendar?
Where's this calendar?
It's on my desk.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.620
Wait, you've got a desk?
Where's this desk?

03:08.622 --> 03:09.188
You can't go.

03:09.190 --> 03:12.324
Erica and barry
have graciously invited me

03:12.326 --> 03:15.761
To see a scary/sexy
teen-vampire movie.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.696
Who is gonna watch
the baby?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.997
Is that me?
It is.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.733
I told you.
I'm not the baby!

03:21.735 --> 03:22.501
I'm a grown, adult man!

03:22.503 --> 03:24.703
And could you please
start this orange?

03:24.705 --> 03:25.337
Come on, bevy!

03:25.339 --> 03:27.406
Can't the boy stay home
alone for the day?

03:27.408 --> 03:30.142
I mean, he is 11
or 14 or whatever.

03:30.144 --> 03:32.211
No! The last time
I went out power walking,

03:32.213 --> 03:36.114
I came home and found him
hiding in the broom closet.

03:36.116 --> 03:36.815
See, that's on you,

03:36.817 --> 03:38.684
'cause you bought
a house with a ghost.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.987
Again with the ghost.
There are no ghosts!
Sure.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.489
People don't die
with unfinished business.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.724
Must be nice
to live in your world.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.360
Okay. We're going
to the ballgame.
Go get your glove.

03:48.362 --> 03:52.197
My michael jackson glove
or my nintendo power glove?

03:52.966 --> 03:53.365
Really?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.601
<i> And so, my dad took me</i>
<i> to watch the phillies play</i>

03:55.603 --> 03:59.338
<i> At old veterans stadium,</i>
<i> a beautiful</i>
<i> world-class arena...</i>

03:59.340 --> 04:00.138
<i> When it was built.</i>

04:00.140 --> 04:03.742
<i> Now it was falling apart</i>
<i> at the seams,</i>
<i> but we loved it anyway.</i>

04:03.744 --> 04:04.376
Dad, I got to pee.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.312
Well, the bathroom's
right up there.
Go ahead.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.380
You want me to go
by myself?

04:08.382 --> 04:11.683
Yeah. Forget what
your mother said.
You're not a baby.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.885
Now stop acting
like a moron and go!

04:13.887 --> 04:15.153
Adult adam: <i> But I didn't</i>
<i> have the guts,</i>

04:15.155 --> 04:18.724
<i> So my dad took me,</i>
<i> like the little</i>
<i> moron baby I was.</i>

04:18.726 --> 04:20.025
<i> The men's room</i>
<i> at veterans stadium</i>

04:20.027 --> 04:24.263
<i> Was a nightmarish hellscape</i>
<i> of people and pee everywhere.</i>

04:24.265 --> 04:26.064
What's that?
It's a trough.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.268
Aim for a cigarette butt
and make a game of it.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.870
(stuttering)
but where's
the dividers?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.305
Where's the handle
to flush?

04:33.307 --> 04:35.007
Where's the dignity,
man?

04:35.009 --> 04:39.011
If you don't like it,
use the stall.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.147
(door creaking)

04:42.915 --> 04:44.650
Mother of mercy.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.517
(softly)
what happened in there?

04:45.519 --> 04:48.687
(softly)
it's on the walls.
It's on the walls.

04:48.689 --> 04:54.126
Please hurry it up.
I feel weird being in here
not doing anything.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.133
Adult adam:
<i> In that moment,</i>

05:01.135 --> 05:04.736
<i> I had what all men experience</i>
<i> at one point or another...</i>

05:04.738 --> 05:05.937
<i> Stage fright.</i>

05:05.939 --> 05:06.538
<i> I couldn't go.</i>

05:06.540 --> 05:10.108
<i> My mind said yes,</i>
<i> but my bladder said no.</i>

05:10.110 --> 05:11.843
I'm done. Let's get
the hell out of here

05:11.845 --> 05:14.313
So I can breathe
through my nose again.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.747
<i> While I was running away</i>
<i> from my fears,</i>

05:15.749 --> 05:19.117
<i> Barry and erica were sitting</i>
<i> through a real horror show,</i>

05:19.119 --> 05:21.620
<i> And I don't mean the movie.</i>

05:21.622 --> 05:22.888
So, which boy is lost?

05:22.890 --> 05:25.324
His poor mother
must be going insane.

05:25.326 --> 05:25.957
Both: Shh!

05:25.959 --> 05:28.193
Oh! I snuck in
some snacks.
(packets rustling)

05:28.195 --> 05:31.496
Got microwave popcorn,
some chips,

05:31.498 --> 05:33.465
And a beautiful tomato.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.399
I don't want a tomato.

05:34.401 --> 05:38.403
Well, it's the last day
before it turns.
Somebody's gonna eat it.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.773
(beverly sighs)

05:41.775 --> 05:43.809
This has been
the best day.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.812
(chuckling) yeah.
It's a real shame it's over.

05:46.814 --> 05:47.612
Oh, it doesn't have to be.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.948
I'm gonna make us a dinner
reservation at red lobster.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.585
Now, it's not lobstober
or shrimptember or clamuary,

05:53.587 --> 05:56.521
So you're gonna
have to order carefully.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.690
What the hell
happened out there?

05:58.692 --> 05:59.391
Mom happened.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.693
(moans)
you know,
she guilted us

06:01.695 --> 06:02.794
Into hanging out
with her again.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.062
You know, it is
seriously not normal

06:04.064 --> 06:07.132
For teenagers to spend
this much time
with their mothers.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.101
I rode the train, man!

06:09.103 --> 06:11.837
I rode the tiny train!

06:11.839 --> 06:12.204
Look.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.473
She took a picture
and everything!
Pops: Okay.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.976
I can't watch you suffer
like this anymore.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.379
Follow me. I'm about
to change your lives.

06:20.381 --> 06:24.182
How?
I'm gonna teach you
how to defeat your mother.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.251
(tense music playing)
it's natural for teenagers

06:26.253 --> 06:28.553
To separate
from their parents.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.288
But your mother
loves you so much,

06:30.290 --> 06:31.523
She'll never
let that happen.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.592
That's why
it's my job to...

06:33.594 --> 06:35.060
Why are you
wearing that outfit?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.496
You're gonna teach us
how to fight mom, right?

06:37.498 --> 06:41.633
No! I'm gonna teach you
to combat her guilt.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.102
Ohhh! That makes
more sense.

06:44.104 --> 06:44.870
Should I go change back?

06:44.872 --> 06:46.104
Just focus on me.
He'll get what he gets.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.608
If you've noticed,
when your mom
tries to guilt me,

06:49.610 --> 06:50.809
It doesn't work.

06:50.811 --> 06:54.012
That's because
of my simple <i> mantra...</i>

06:54.014 --> 06:56.047
"it's not real. Don't feel."

06:56.049 --> 06:58.417
What's not real?
The pain she's in.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.953
Her guilt and tears
are just a manipulation.

07:01.955 --> 07:02.721
Don't fall for it.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.289
Pops, if your thing
was so easy,

07:04.291 --> 07:06.391
We would have done it
a long time ago.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.059
Oh, you're right.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.495
I'm just a silly old man.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.930
I...I should just go home,

07:11.932 --> 07:14.733
Ball up my socks,
and go to bed.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.135
No, don't. I'm sorry.
Don't do that! We love you!

07:17.137 --> 07:18.870
It's not real! Don't feel!

07:18.872 --> 07:20.639
Wait.
That was just an act?

07:20.641 --> 07:23.608
Yes! My god,
you're weak and soft!

07:23.610 --> 07:26.945
Say it with me.
"it's not real. Don't feel."

07:26.947 --> 07:28.680
Both: It's not real.
Don't feel.

07:28.682 --> 07:32.317
Louder!
Both: It's not real!
Don't feel!

07:32.319 --> 07:34.186
Not that loud.
She'll hear you,

07:34.188 --> 07:35.187
And then,
we're all in trouble.

07:35.189 --> 07:38.356
Adult adam:
<i> As my brother and sister</i>
<i> were learning to fight back,</i>

07:38.358 --> 07:42.761
<i> I was battling the 64 ounces</i>
<i> of mountain dew in my bladder!</i>

07:42.763 --> 07:44.696
Dad,
I have to pee again.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.131
What? You just went!

07:46.133 --> 07:48.400
All right, I'm not gonna
sugarcoat this.

07:48.402 --> 07:49.167
My bladder shut down.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.836
There's too much pressure
at the trough.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.304
Well, why don't you use
the damn stall?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.339
Don't speak
of the stall... Ever!

07:54.341 --> 07:56.875
Well, it's too late.
The bases are loaded.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.110
I'm not taking you again.
So just go!

07:59.112 --> 08:00.712
Isn't there some
private executive washroom

08:00.714 --> 08:04.616
With scented soaps
instead of a giant
metal river of whiz?

08:04.618 --> 08:07.185
When will the hand-holding
end, already?

08:07.187 --> 08:09.621
For once in your life,
be a man.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.522
You don't think
I'm a man?

08:10.524 --> 08:14.059
All right, let me
answer that question
with this question.

08:14.061 --> 08:17.095
What superhero is on your
underwear right now?

08:17.097 --> 08:20.165
I outgrew those
months ago!
Uh-huh.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.433
I'll show you!
I'll go!

08:21.435 --> 08:23.668
Go!
Fine! I'm going!

08:23.670 --> 08:25.804
Good! You're doing
what I want you to do!

08:25.806 --> 08:27.138
Adult adam: <i> Sure,</i>
<i> I was mad at my dad,</i>

08:27.140 --> 08:29.941
<i> But mostly,</i>
<i> I was mad at myself,</i>
<i> 'cause he was right.</i>

08:29.943 --> 08:32.677
<i> So I set out to prove</i>
<i> my manhood once and for all,</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:36.648
<i> And the first step</i>
<i> was going potty by myself!</i>

08:36.650 --> 08:37.115
Nope.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.518
Excuse me. Which way
to the upper level?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.753
I'm thinking
the higher you go,
the fancier it gets.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.522
<i> So I headed up</i>
<i> to what I figured</i>

08:43.524 --> 08:47.025
<i> Was the super-fancy</i>
<i> 700 level.</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:48.827
Not fancy.
Not fancy.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.896
<i> I finally gave up</i>
<i> and headed back to my seats.</i>

08:50.898 --> 08:55.400
<i> Just one problem...</i>
<i> I had no idea</i>
<i> where my seats were.</i>

09:03.476 --> 09:05.744
Oh, balls!

09:08.080 --> 09:08.980
<i> Early bird dinner was over,</i>

09:08.982 --> 09:13.118
<i> And erica and barry</i>
<i> had been with my mom</i>
<i> for six straight hours.</i>

09:13.120 --> 09:15.120
<i> She was going for seven.</i>

09:15.122 --> 09:16.721
Wow. I am stuffed.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.256
(chuckles)
what do you say
we go home

09:18.258 --> 09:19.824
And burn off
some of these calories

09:19.826 --> 09:21.459
With a little bedazzling?

09:21.461 --> 09:22.594
Ugh! Make it stop!

09:22.596 --> 09:24.062
It's too much
time with you!

09:24.064 --> 09:25.230
I'm sorry, but I'm done.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.533
If spending time
with your mother
is some kind of torture,

09:28.535 --> 09:29.968
Then I'll just walk home.

09:29.970 --> 09:30.535
Stop the car.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.837
Adult adam: <i> And there it was,</i>
<i> her signature guilt move...</i>

09:32.839 --> 09:37.108
<i> Storming out of the car</i>
<i> and making us</i>
<i> beg her to come back.</i>

09:37.110 --> 09:37.943
Here I go.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.478
I'll probably get
flattened by a truck,

09:40.480 --> 09:41.212
Not that you'd care.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.749
Aw, man!
She's out of the car!
Now what do we do?

09:44.751 --> 09:45.350
Nothing.

09:45.352 --> 09:49.254
Remember what pops said?
"it's not real. Don't feel."

09:49.256 --> 09:49.721
I'm walking!

09:49.723 --> 09:51.289
We should just drive off
and let her walk home.

09:51.291 --> 09:55.026
You heard her.
She could be
flattened by a truck!

09:55.028 --> 09:55.794
She's not a squirrel!

09:55.796 --> 09:58.563
We're 10 minutes
from home.
She'll be fine.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.332
I'm walking.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.901
All right, we need
to take a stand
and drive away.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.869
Are you with me?
I don't know!

10:04.871 --> 10:05.570
Still walking!

10:05.572 --> 10:08.506
I need you to look me
in the eye and say
you are with me.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.274
I'm with you!

10:09.276 --> 10:12.944
God save my soul,
I'm with you!

10:13.813 --> 10:15.780
(engine revs)

10:15.782 --> 10:18.016
I knew you'd come
to your senses.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.652
We're doing it!
This is really happening!

10:20.654 --> 10:23.888
I've never felt
so alive in my life!

10:24.123 --> 10:26.691
Adult adam:
<i> As my brother and sister</i>
<i> were flying high,</i>

10:26.693 --> 10:29.661
<i> My dad was crashing</i>
<i> down to reality.</i>

10:29.663 --> 10:30.962
Damn it. Where is he?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.397
<i> See, back before cellphones,</i>

10:32.399 --> 10:34.666
<i> Getting lost</i>
<i> was a much bigger deal.</i>

10:34.668 --> 10:36.401
I'm fine. It's fine.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.136
It's all gonna be fine.

10:38.138 --> 10:42.674
So I'm hungry and alone
and may never be rescued.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.441
It's good times.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.076
<i> The only way</i>
<i> to actually find someone</i>

10:45.078 --> 10:47.379
<i> Was to shout their name</i>
<i> really loud.</i>

10:47.381 --> 10:47.746
Adam?

10:47.748 --> 10:50.382
<i> When that didn't work,</i>
<i> my dad decided to</i>
<i> awkwardly approach anyone</i>

10:50.384 --> 10:53.084
<i> Who even looked</i>
<i> a little like me.</i>

10:53.886 --> 10:55.120
Tiny lady. Sorry.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.656
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> the more I ran around,</i>
<i> the more lost I got.</i>

10:57.658 --> 11:01.660
<i> Luckily, my dad came up</i>
<i> with the perfect plan</i>
<i> to track me down.</i>

11:01.662 --> 11:03.828
Whoa, whoa.
Slow it down there, boss.

11:03.830 --> 11:04.663
That's a restricted area.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.031
Yeah, yeah.
I got separated
from my son,

11:06.033 --> 11:09.267
And I need to make
an announcement
to the entire stadium.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.168
Okay, that makes sense.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.803
This kid of yours...
What's he look like?

11:11.805 --> 11:14.873
I don't know. He's a boy.
He's normal-looking.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.374
He's got hair, a face.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.542
I...I don't look at him much.

11:17.544 --> 11:20.612
Uh-huh. And, uh,
how old is this boy?

11:20.614 --> 11:21.713
Eleven.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.114
Or... 14.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.382
Can I just go
make my announcement?

11:24.384 --> 11:27.852
Oh, yeah, sure.
And after, you wanna
visit the dugout

11:27.854 --> 11:29.387
Or shower in
the locker room?

11:29.389 --> 11:30.622
Very funny.
Hey,

11:30.624 --> 11:31.890
How are your
fielding skills?

11:31.892 --> 11:32.724
You wanna play shortstop?

11:32.726 --> 11:35.226
Just know I will make it
through that door.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.263
Better yet, why don't
I have two of my friends

11:38.265 --> 11:40.665
Escort you to
the vip section?

11:41.467 --> 11:43.735
(sighs)

11:44.036 --> 11:45.470
(lock rattles)

11:45.472 --> 11:47.739
My kid's in there!

11:48.474 --> 11:50.742
Adult adam: <i> While my dad</i>
<i> had hit an all-time low,</i>

11:50.744 --> 11:53.611
<i> Barry and erica</i>
<i> were riding high.</i>

11:53.613 --> 11:54.612
Dude, we did it!

11:54.614 --> 11:56.715
For once, we didn't
give in to her guilt!

11:56.717 --> 11:59.718
I know!
We totally drove away!

11:59.720 --> 12:03.221
I feel so exhilarated,
like I just killed a man!

12:03.223 --> 12:05.523
Exactly! Wait. What?
Barry: Pops,

12:05.525 --> 12:06.991
We did just like you said
with mom.

12:06.993 --> 12:10.261
Way to go, kiddos.
I want to hear all about it.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.531
You know that thing mom does
when she storms out of the car

12:13.533 --> 12:15.200
And then you have to
beg her to get back in?

12:15.202 --> 12:16.434
Oh, yeah...
The big guns.
Barry: Well,

12:16.436 --> 12:20.405
We left her on the side of
the road like an old mattress!

12:20.407 --> 12:21.940
Boom!

12:22.041 --> 12:23.007
What? Are you nuts?

12:23.009 --> 12:27.045
You don't leave your mother
on the side of the road!
Who does that?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.847
That's exactly
what you said to do.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.482
That's not
what I said at all!

12:30.484 --> 12:31.883
Why are you making us
feel guilty?

12:31.885 --> 12:32.951
I thought
you were on our side!

12:32.953 --> 12:34.552
My god!
What have you done?

12:34.554 --> 12:38.123
(doorbell rings)
everybody just chill,
okay?

12:38.125 --> 12:40.558
That's her.
She's fine.

12:41.193 --> 12:41.726
Evening.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.528
It was the old man!
He put us up to it!

12:43.530 --> 12:45.730
They misunderstood
my rhyme!

12:45.732 --> 12:48.333
It doesn't matter.
Is our mom okay?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.601
She's fine.
I gave her a lift.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.237
Lucky for her,
I was driving down
old york road

12:52.239 --> 12:53.138
And was temporarily blinded

12:53.140 --> 12:55.640
By the sunlight reflecting
off of her bejeweled jacket.

12:55.642 --> 12:59.477
Where is she?
In the back of my cruiser
with a little pack of tissues.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.346
She's pretty certain
she failed as a mother.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.315
I know this looks bad,
but you have to understand

13:04.317 --> 13:06.084
She uses guilt
to get her way.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.752
So...
She's like every mom.

13:07.754 --> 13:13.091
Except in this case,
you abandoned her
on the side of the road.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.726
Shame on you.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.761
Officer: Shame.

13:18.597 --> 13:22.100
Thank you for seeing me
home safely, officer.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.568
It was very kind.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.604
You must be
a wonderful son.

13:27.606 --> 13:28.573
Mom...

13:28.575 --> 13:29.574
Bup-bup-bup.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.343
I have one thing
to say to you.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.946
That was (bleep) up.

13:34.948 --> 13:39.184
Adult adam: <i> Only one person</i>
<i> felt worse than barry</i>
<i> and erica... My dad.</i>

13:39.186 --> 13:40.318
<i> He was so desperate to find me</i>

13:40.320 --> 13:42.787
<i> That he sought help in</i>
<i> the most unlikely of places...</i>

13:42.789 --> 13:46.057
<i> A parking lot</i>
<i> full of philly tailgaters.</i>

13:46.059 --> 13:46.457
Hey.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.759
You guys got an extra ticket
you could sell me?

13:47.761 --> 13:50.862
I...I got tossed out
of the stadium.
I need to get back in.

13:50.864 --> 13:51.796
Why'd you get ejected,
chief?

13:51.798 --> 13:56.434
Um, I got into it
with a security guard
because I lost my son.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.836
In veterans stadium?

13:57.838 --> 14:01.339
Damn, that is just some
bad parenting right there.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.209
I never let my little fella
out of my sight.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.877
(sizzling)

14:06.111 --> 14:06.611
Tell you what.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.913
Let me cb the other camps
around the stadium,

14:08.915 --> 14:10.281
See if anybody's
seen your kid.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.151
Wow. You'd do that?
Well, thank you.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.287
It's what phillies fans do.
So, how old is he?
What does he look like?

14:16.289 --> 14:19.257
Why's everybody
need to know that?

14:19.925 --> 14:21.960
Hey.
I...I'm kind of lost.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.428
Could you please
help me find my dad?

14:23.430 --> 14:25.396
Of course, we can help you
find your dad.

14:25.398 --> 14:29.634
Why don't you step over there
with the other lost kids?

14:30.669 --> 14:33.438
Adult adam:
<i> As I looked at that line</i>
<i> of lost little tykes,</i>

14:33.440 --> 14:34.405
<i> I knew I couldn't join them.</i>

14:34.407 --> 14:38.343
<i> I finally had to man up</i>
<i> and become</i>
<i> the 11- or 14-year-old</i>

14:38.345 --> 14:40.078
<i> My dad wanted me to be.</i>

14:40.080 --> 14:41.112
No! Not today!

14:41.114 --> 14:44.983
I'm lost, I'm starving,
and I still haven't peed,

14:44.985 --> 14:47.352
But I will survive!

14:47.354 --> 14:52.323
<i> As I was finally confronting</i>
<i> the most disgusting bathroom</i>
<i> in the world,</i>

14:52.325 --> 14:54.259
<i> Erica and barry</i>
<i> were about to face</i>

14:54.261 --> 14:57.328
<i> The most emotionally</i>
<i> manipulative mother</i>

14:57.330 --> 14:58.696
<i> In the universe.</i>

14:58.698 --> 15:00.231
Hey, mama.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.835
I don't think
she heard you.
Do it again.

15:03.837 --> 15:04.235
Hey.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.871
Oh, stop it. I heard you.
I'm just not answering.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.306
We feel horrible.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.574
And we made
a little peace offering

15:09.576 --> 15:11.109
To show you
how sorry we are.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.912
It's a picture
of you. See?

15:13.914 --> 15:14.913
You're smiling,
like you used to

15:14.915 --> 15:18.016
Before we ditched you
on the side of the road
like human trash.

15:18.018 --> 15:22.086
Your shading and tones
don't quite capture
my loving essence,

15:22.088 --> 15:23.955
But I appreciate
the effort.

15:23.957 --> 15:24.822
Maybe you could teach us.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.892
How does that sound?
We bedazzle for
the rest of the day.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.460
Well, that's
a good first step,

15:29.462 --> 15:30.728
But it's gonna take
a lot more

15:30.730 --> 15:32.530
Than rhinestones
and glitter

15:32.532 --> 15:34.032
To make up
for what you did.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.234
Name it. Anything.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.835
I want huggies.
Fine.

15:37.837 --> 15:38.603
And snuggies.
On it.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.338
And kissies.
Absolutely.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.873
And nubbies.

15:42.107 --> 15:42.941
Lots and lots of nubbies.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.644
I don't know what that is,
and I'm scared to find out,
but sure.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.680
We're gonna go set up
the bedazzler.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.415
We'll meet you upstairs.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.152
Adult adam:
<i> And just like that,</i>
<i> my mother realized</i>

15:54.154 --> 15:55.386
<i> That getting abandoned</i>
<i> on the side of the road</i>

15:55.388 --> 15:57.989
<i> Was the best thing that</i>
<i> could have happened to her.</i>

15:57.991 --> 16:00.792
Erica: Mom,
are you coming?

16:00.794 --> 16:03.328
I'll be there in a minute.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.830
Adult adam: <i> It was</i>
<i> the bottom of the ninth.</i>

16:05.832 --> 16:07.999
<i> I was still lost,</i>
<i> but at least I wasn't alone.</i>

16:08.001 --> 16:12.870
I guess I just really
want to show my dad what
I'm made of, you know?

16:12.872 --> 16:16.007
In here.
Does that make sense?

16:16.742 --> 16:17.608
(noisemaker blows)

16:17.610 --> 16:19.410
Okay, you've done that
three times.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.211
I don't know
what that means.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.814
Adult adam:
<i> As I was getting annoyed</i>
<i> with my new green friend,</i>

16:22.816 --> 16:24.282
<i> Barry and erica</i>
<i> were bedazzling</i>

16:24.284 --> 16:26.918
<i> With all the colors</i>
<i> of the rainbow.</i>

16:26.920 --> 16:27.652
What's all this?

16:27.654 --> 16:31.622
Oh, just a bunch
of bedazzmanian devils
going crazy!

16:31.624 --> 16:33.157
(imitates tasmanian devil)

16:33.159 --> 16:35.126
(chuckles)
it's been a fun hour.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.461
You know what?
We're out of silver studs.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.763
I'm gonna go get some
from my craft drawer.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.764
Yes! We need more.

16:39.766 --> 16:43.434
This is so fun!
(chuckles)
help us.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.870
I'm sorry.
You hurt her for real.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.105
You got to pay the price.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.807
But we bedazzled
everything.

16:49.809 --> 16:50.341
Look.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.076
I even bedazzled
my flyers jersey,

16:52.078 --> 16:54.812
And in some weird way,
I think it looks amazing.

16:54.814 --> 16:58.182
And what are nubbies?
What are nubbies?

16:58.184 --> 16:59.851
She said "nubbies"?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.886
Oh, you're way too old
for that.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.721
I'll talk to her.

17:04.423 --> 17:05.056
Bevy, listen,

17:05.058 --> 17:08.593
The kids don't deserve
all the blame
for what they did.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.797
I may have taught them
how to stand up to your guilt.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.532
That was you?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.534
Thank you so much.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.770
Thank you for this
wonderful gift.

17:18.772 --> 17:22.140
(stuttering) wait.
What's happening?
You're not angry?

17:22.142 --> 17:24.976
This is literally
my dream come true.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.577
Now they're under
my thumb forever.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.447
I get to decide
how they live,
who they marry,

17:29.449 --> 17:31.115
Where they take me
on vacation,

17:31.117 --> 17:34.485
And all because they left me
on the side of the road.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.255
Honey, you can't
hold them hostage
with guilt

17:37.257 --> 17:38.189
For the rest
of their lives.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.391
They're just gonna
end up resenting you.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.494
But...What else
am I supposed to do?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.129
I'm their mom.
If it were up to them,

17:45.131 --> 17:46.264
They'd never
spend time with me.

17:46.266 --> 17:50.401
Have you ever wondered
why they love hanging out
with me so much?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.470
'cause I don't
force them to.

17:52.472 --> 17:56.541
Also, I'm pretty
frickin' delightful.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.609
You are pretty delightful.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.444
And so are you.

17:59.446 --> 18:03.681
(john hiatt's <i> have</i>
<i> a little faith in me</i> playing)

18:04.349 --> 18:07.151
(sighs)
put the stud guns down.
You're free to go.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.320
No, really.
We're having fun.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.221
You're not.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.723
You've done this
long enough,
and we're even.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.393
But we're just trying
to apologize for what we did.

18:15.395 --> 18:18.830
No, I'm the one
who needs to apologize.

18:22.201 --> 18:25.470
I guilt you kids
way too much.

18:26.071 --> 18:27.572
It's just, uh...

18:27.574 --> 18:32.543
When you were little,
all you wanted to do
was spend time with me.

18:32.545 --> 18:37.181
And, you know,
a mom gets used to that.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.083
You two will
never understand

18:39.085 --> 18:43.121
How much it hurts
when that goes away.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.824
I think that's just
the way things
are right now.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.592
You know,

18:47.594 --> 18:50.661
We really meant
what we bedazzled.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.263
We do love you.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.264
I know.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.299
Just no nubbies.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.300
Deal.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.402
Adult adam:
<i> While my mom had found common</i>
<i> ground with barry and erica,</i>

18:58.404 --> 19:02.206
<i> I still hadn't found my dad,</i>
<i> but we weren't out of options.</i>

19:02.208 --> 19:03.741
<i> Back then,</i>
<i> whenever you got lost,</i>

19:03.743 --> 19:09.013
<i> The last resort was always</i>
<i> the same... Meet at the car.</i>

19:09.848 --> 19:12.250
<i> Of course, I had no idea</i>
<i> where we were parked,</i>

19:12.252 --> 19:16.454
<i> So I had to wait until</i>
<i> every single car was gone.</i>

19:16.456 --> 19:20.525
<i> ¶ and have</i>
<i> a little faith in me</i>

19:23.028 --> 19:27.098
<i> ¶ and have</i>
<i> a little faith in me</i>

19:28.634 --> 19:33.004
<i> ¶ and have</i>
<i> a little faith in me</i>

19:33.006 --> 19:34.372
Adult adam: <i> I was ready</i>
<i> to give my dad hell.</i>

19:34.374 --> 19:37.909
<i> I wanted to tell him</i>
<i> how I survived on my own</i>
<i> and proved him wrong.</i>

19:37.911 --> 19:39.310
<i> I wanted to tell him</i>
<i> I was a man.</i>

19:39.312 --> 19:43.548
<i> I wanted to tell him that</i>
<i> I didn't need him anymore.</i>

19:43.916 --> 19:46.350
<i> But instead, I did this.</i>

19:46.352 --> 19:47.818
(sobbing)

19:47.820 --> 19:50.321
(sniffles)
I know.

19:50.422 --> 19:54.158
You're safe.
You're safe.

19:54.459 --> 19:57.395
<i> ¶ just turn around</i>
<i> and you...</i>

19:57.397 --> 19:59.430
Adult adam: <i> I spent</i>
<i> most of that day lost,</i>

19:59.432 --> 20:01.232
<i> But what I remember most</i>
<i> is what I found.</i>

20:01.234 --> 20:03.534
<i> I found out that</i>
<i> I could do okay on my own,</i>

20:03.536 --> 20:07.171
<i> And my dad discovered</i>
<i> he didn't want me</i>
<i> to grow up too fast.</i>

20:07.173 --> 20:10.007
<i> ¶ just have a little</i>
<i> faith in me ¶</i>

20:10.009 --> 20:11.075
Hey, ma.

20:11.077 --> 20:11.809
Hi.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.477
Back from
another normal day.

20:13.479 --> 20:16.314
Well, come into the nook.
(chuckles)

20:16.882 --> 20:19.083
It's <i> battle of</i>
<i> the network stars,</i>

20:19.085 --> 20:21.219
Fonzie sure can
throw a javelin.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.120
Adult adam:
<i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about parents...</i>

20:23.122 --> 20:24.222
<i> They always drive you crazy.</i>

20:24.224 --> 20:27.158
Oh. Got a beautiful tomato
if you're hungry.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.693
Mom, enough
with the tomato.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.127
Someone's gonna
eat this thing today.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.163
<i> But in a world where we all</i>
<i> get lost sometimes...</i>

20:32.165 --> 20:34.298
Stop! Stop, mom!
Kissy shark!
Kissy shark!

20:34.300 --> 20:36.534
Stop! Stop it!
Rah, rah,
rah, rah, rah!

20:36.536 --> 20:37.535
<i> ...There's nothing better</i>

20:37.537 --> 20:40.171
<i> Than having people</i>
<i> who love you so much,</i>

20:40.173 --> 20:42.273
<i> They never want to let you go.</i>

20:42.275 --> 20:45.276
Erica: No! No, no, no!
Mom, mom!

20:47.045 --> 20:50.314
Three...Two...Fire!

20:52.985 --> 20:54.752
(ding)

21:01.260 --> 21:01.659
Hey!

21:01.661 --> 21:03.794
Hey. Whoa!
What is that?

21:03.796 --> 21:05.663
(laughing)
oh, you mean the shirt?

21:05.665 --> 21:08.032
I'm going to the phillies game
later with dad,

21:08.034 --> 21:11.135
So I bedazzled this as a joke
just to drive him crazy.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.471
I mean, I would never
wear this to the game.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.406
Unless you think I could
maybe wear it to the game.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.476
You know, you shouldn't just
wear it to the game.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.844
I would wear it to school.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.313
That's what I thought!
Thank you!

21:22.315 --> 21:26.517
I mean, this is a joke,
but... But thank you!
