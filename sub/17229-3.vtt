20:46.512 --> 20:49.682
I JUST FEEL SO SILLY.

20:49.682 --> 20:52.118
AND TO THINK
I WAS GONNA STEAL YOU AWAY

20:52.118 --> 20:54.220
FOR $800 A WEEK
PLUS A FOOD STIPEND.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.055
<i>I'LL</i> DO IT!

20:58.624 --> 21:02.361
FOR THAT MONEY,
I'LL LOVE <i>ANY</i> KID.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.099
HEY, <i>WE</i> DON'T WANT HER.
