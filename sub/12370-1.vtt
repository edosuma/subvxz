00:03.294 --> 00:04.587
I'M ALEX TREBEK,

00:04.671 --> 00:07.465
HOST OF AMERICA'S
FAVORITE GAME SHOW.

00:07.549 --> 00:11.136
audience: <i> WHEEL OF FORTUNE!</i>

00:13.179 --> 00:14.472

00:14.556 --> 00:16.056
<i>JEOPARDY!</i>

00:16.140 --> 00:17.267
AND I WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU

00:17.350 --> 00:18.560
TO THE GREATEST NIGHT
OF TELEVISION

00:18.643 --> 00:20.228
YOU WILL EVER WITNESS.

00:20.311 --> 00:22.647
FIRST OFF,
AND PERFORMING LIVE,

00:22.731 --> 00:26.901
FOUR WOMEN WHO ARE
AT THE VERY PEAK OF THEIR CRAFT.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.987
ONE OF THEM IS DRUNK.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.447
YOU'LL SEE.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.448
NOW,
WHEN WE LAST SAW OUR LADIES,

00:32.531 --> 00:34.451
WE HAD LEFT THEM
IN A NUMBER OF CLIFF-HANGERS,

00:34.534 --> 00:35.910
BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:35.994 --> 00:39.456
WE'RE GONNA RESOLVE ALL OF THAT
FOR YOU RIGHT HERE,

00:39.539 --> 00:43.251
BUT ON NEXT WEEK'S EPISODE.

00:43.334 --> 00:46.296
SO BE SURE TO TUNE IN NEXT WEEK
FOR THAT.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.840
BUT FOR TONIGHT,
WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO,

00:48.923 --> 00:50.925
LIVE FROM STUDIO CITY,

00:51.009 --> 00:53.011
THIS IS <i> HOT IN CLEVELAND.</i>

00:53.094 --> 00:55.388
[cheers and applause]

01:00.560 --> 01:02.145
- [sighs]

01:02.228 --> 01:03.146
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.938
EMMET AND I FINALLY
GET MARRIED,

01:05.022 --> 01:07.984
AND NOW HE'S ESCAPED
FROM PRISON WEARING MY CLOTHES.

01:08.067 --> 01:11.696
- VICTORIA'S HUSBAND IS
A WORLD-CLASS ACTOR

01:11.780 --> 01:16.451
AND AS SUCH,
A MASTER OF DISGUISE.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.369
- WE GOT THIS, TREBEK.

01:25.543 --> 01:26.961
- EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T
HELP HIM ESCAPE,

01:27.045 --> 01:28.671
YOU ARE AN ACCESSORY.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.465
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST TURN
YOURSELF IN TO THE POLICE.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.009
- OR MAYBE I SHOULD WAIT
TO HEAR FROM EMMET.

01:33.092 --> 01:34.177
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.513
I JUST NEED TIME
TO THINK.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.640
OH, IF ONLY THERE WERE
A HIDEOUT I COULD GO TO,

01:38.723 --> 01:40.517
WHERE THE POLICE COULDN'T
FIND ME.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.977
- IF ONLY SOMEONE AMONG US HAD
A CRIMINAL PAST.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.896
- AND WAS ONCE MARRIED
TO THE MOB.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.189
- AND IS RIGHT HERE

01:46.272 --> 01:47.857
AND OLD ENOUGH
TO REMEMBER

01:47.941 --> 01:49.901
WHERE SHE WAS
WHEN CAESAR WAS ASSASSINATED.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.365
- OKAY.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.368
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PUT A BAG
OVER YOUR HEAD.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.869
- SO WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

01:59.953 --> 02:02.664
- [laughs]
YEAH, THAT'S WHY.

{\an8}I GOT THE CABIN READY,

02:17.470 --> 02:19.597
{\an8}BUT I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.933
{\an8}THE STORE DIDN'T HAVE
FAT-FREE HALF-AND-HALF,

02:22.016 --> 02:23.017

02:43.162 --> 02:47.417
{\an8}THERE'S SOME OTHER CRIMINALS

02:47.500 --> 02:50.253

MR. AND MRS. ROBINSON,

{\an8}- GENIUS HERE THOUGH THIS WOULD
BE A GOOD PLACE TO HIDE OUT.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.346
{\an8}- HE DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE A GENIUS,

03:00.430 --> 03:04.267
{\an8}BUT SHE KEEPS CALLING HIM THAT.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.436
{\an8}- VICTORIA CHASE,
I BELIEVE WE KNOW EACH OTHER.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.812
{\an8}- OH, DO WE?

03:07.896 --> 03:12.191
{\an8}- YES, WE HAD A BLIND DATE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.446
I'M CHESTER.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.828
- CHESTER, OF COURSE.

03:23.912 --> 03:28.583
OF COURSE.
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A BOOB.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.836
- I BET YOU WISH YOU COULD
FILL UP A TOP LIKE THAT.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.298
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.425
YOU TOO.
LILY, GRAB THEIR PHONES.

03:37.508 --> 03:38.593
- GET COMFORTABLE.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.094
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE
A LITTLE WHILE.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.931
GENIUS HERE DROPPED HIS MASK
DURING THE HEIST,

03:43.014 --> 03:44.641
SO NOW WE GOT
TO CHANGE HIS FACE.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.476
A PLASTIC SURGEON IS
ON HIS WAY.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.353
- A PLASTIC SURGEON, YOU SAY?
- OOH!

03:48.436 --> 03:50.021
- YEAH, THERE'S NO RULE
THAT SAYS

03:50.104 --> 03:52.190
YOU CAN'T COMBINE KIDNAPPING
WITH A LITTLE TOUCH-UP.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.608
- NO, I JUST WANT
A LITTLE BOTOX.

03:53.691 --> 03:54.567
I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO CRAZY.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.028
- I'M THE ONLY ONE GETTING
PLASTIC SURGERY,

03:57.111 --> 03:58.988
AND NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE
TILL IT'S DONE,

03:59.072 --> 03:59.989
AND I'M ALL HEALED UP.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.282
- NO, BUT THAT COULD TAKE WEEKS,

04:01.366 --> 04:02.867
AND THEN THERE'S THE SETTLING,

04:02.951 --> 04:04.994
{\an1}AND THEN YOU CAN STILL ONLY GO
TO LUNCH WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND--

04:05.078 --> 04:05.995
[all speaking at once]

04:06.079 --> 04:08.373
- OR I COULD SHOOT YOU
RIGHT NOW.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.374
GOOD.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.917
YOU THREE MAKE
YOURSELVES USEFUL.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.168
GO FIX US SOMETHING
TO EAT.

- OH, YOU'RE GONNA WISH
YOU'D SHOT 'EM.

MAMIE SUE,
FIRST-TIME HOSTAGE,

04:22.595 --> 04:26.432
LONG-TIME FEARER
OF BEING A HOSTAGE.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.227
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF WE COULD BE OUT BY TOMORROW

04:29.310 --> 04:32.522
BECAUSE IT'S OUR SENIOR CENTER
BOOK CLUB MEETING.

04:32.605 --> 04:37.068
WE'RE READING
<i>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY...</i>

04:37.151 --> 04:39.237
AGAIN.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.863

04:40.947 --> 04:42.031
AND DON'T TRY ANYTHING CLEVER.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.241
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

04:43.324 --> 04:47.036
SHE NEVER DOES ANYTHING CLEVER.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.706
- THANK YOU, ELKA.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.833
- OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

04:51.916 --> 04:54.043
WE ARE TOO YOUNG TO DIE.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.671
OKAY, WE <i> LOOK</i> TOO YOUNG TO DIE.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.214
- I HAVE A PLAN.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.216
WHEN THE PLASTIC SURGEON
PUTS CHESTER UNDER,

05:00.299 --> 05:01.884
WE'LL OVERPOWER LILY
AND CALL THE POLICE.

- OKAY, MELANIE AND I WILL GO.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.181

FOR LUNCH.

05:07.265 --> 05:11.602

05:30.788 --> 05:35.376
I'M THE PLASTIC SURGEON
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.421
- YOU'RE DR. JIN-HO KANG?

05:38.504 --> 05:40.548
- YOU'RE WONDERING WHY MY NAME
IS JIN-HO KANG,

05:40.631 --> 05:42.925
AND I DON'T APPEAR
TO BE KOREAN.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.386
WELL,
IT'S A FASCINATING STORY FILLED

05:45.470 --> 05:47.555
WITH A GREAT MANY
UNEXPECTED TWISTS.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.891
- WERE YOU ADOPTED
BY A KOREAN FAMILY?

05:49.974 --> 05:52.935
- YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.103
LOOKING BACK,

05:54.187 --> 05:57.815
I OVERESTIMATED THE NUMBER
OF TWISTS.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.943
- WHAT'S WITH THE CHAMPAGNE?

06:01.027 --> 06:03.696
- YOU'RE MY 100TH CUSTOMER.
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.575
- WAIT A SECOND.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.119
I'M THE ONE
WHO NEEDS PLASTIC SURGERY.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.081
- YES, I SEE.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.749
- HEY, MY FACE IS UP HERE.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.626
- OH?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.086
- UH...

06:18.169 --> 06:19.462
AS A SURGEON,

06:19.545 --> 06:21.964
I'M SURE YOU NEED
TO SCRUB UP

06:22.048 --> 06:23.091
BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.634
- AND I'M SURE
FROM WHAT YOU JUST SAID,

06:24.717 --> 06:27.178
YOU MUST BE A NURSE,
AND I'LL NEED YOU TO ASSIST ME.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.934
ALL RIGHT, WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON AROUND HERE?

06:33.017 --> 06:33.935
- BOB, GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.478
I NEED TO CALL THE POLICE

06:35.561 --> 06:37.271
AND TELL THEM WE'RE BEING
HELD HOSTAGE BY THOSE THIEVES.

06:37.355 --> 06:37.980
- I LEFT MY PHONE IN THE CAR.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.273
- UH!
- UGH!

06:39.357 --> 06:40.358
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

06:40.441 --> 06:41.609

06:41.692 --> 06:44.153
- MY TEXT
SAID I NEEDED A FEW DAYS OFF.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.279
- THE TEXT I GOT SAID
YOU WANTED ME

06:45.363 --> 06:46.614
TO GET YOU OFF FOR A FEW DAYS.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.491

07:02.588 --> 07:04.841
I'M GONNA GO WITH LUCKY GUESS.

TO GO TO YOUR CAR

07:08.344 --> 07:11.681

07:32.785 --> 07:36.873
- WELL, PERHAPS WE'LL NEVER KNOW
WHO THE REAL JIN-HO KANG IS.

- OKAY, IT'S SO OBVIOUS
THAT IT'S ME.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.629
- WELL, THAT'S JUST RACIST.

THIS DELICATELY?

08:17.997 --> 08:20.917

- IT'S AN ABSORBENT PANT.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.129

OKAY.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.590

08:30.635 --> 08:35.264
both: IT'S AN ABSORBENT PANT!

08:35.347 --> 08:37.642

09:12.009 --> 09:14.804
WHAT DO WE DO
AT 3:00 ON WEDNESDAYS?

09:14.887 --> 09:17.139
- YOU HAD THE MARRIAGE COUNSELOR
COME TO OUR HIDEOUT?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.433
- BUT YOU PROMISED--EVERY WEEK.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.602
AND WE STILL HAVE ISSUES
TO WORK ON.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.271
- BUT WE'RE DOING THINGS
TOGETHER.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.065
WE ROBBED THE JEWELRY STORE
TOGETHER.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.985
[sighs]

09:29.068 --> 09:30.319
- HELLO, CHESTER.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.453
- HI, REVEREND BOYCE.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.289
- WOW, THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE HERE.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.000
YOU KNOW, I USUALLY LIKE
TO DO MY COUPLES COUNSELING

09:44.083 --> 09:45.543
WITH JUST THE COUPLES.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.045
- WE CAN GO TO THE TV ROOM,
ELKA.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.965
IT'S 3:00.
STEVE HARVEY'S ON.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.969
- OH, NOBODY'S--NOBODY'S FUNNIER
THAN STEVE HARVEY.

09:57.013 --> 10:00.182
- REALLY?
NO ONE?

10:00.266 --> 10:04.687
- HE'S LIKE
THE ORIGINAL KING OF COMEDY.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.314
- YEAH.

10:06.397 --> 10:09.525
YEAH, YOU KNOW THERE WERE
OTHER KINGS OF COMEDY.

10:09.608 --> 10:13.863
- BUT HE WAS THE FUNNY ONE.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.990
- OH, OH, THE WAY RUE MCCLANAHAN
WAS THE FUNNY ONE

10:16.073 --> 10:17.616
ON <i> THE GOLDEN GIRLS.</i>

10:22.496 --> 10:24.498
- I NEVER SAW THAT SHOW.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.378
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.672
FOLLOW MY LEAD.
- ALL RIGHT.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.674
- IT'S SO GREAT
FOR CHESTER AND LILY

10:33.758 --> 10:36.010
THAT YOU'VE COME HERE TO <i> HELP.</i>

10:36.093 --> 10:38.554
- YES, ESPECIALLY <i> HELP</i>
FROM A REVEREND

10:38.637 --> 10:40.848
WHO'S IN THE BUSINESS
OF <i> SAVING</i> PEOPLE.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.059
- BECAUSE SOMETIMES
BEING MARRIED IS

10:43.142 --> 10:45.561
LIKE HAVING A <i> GUN</i>
TO YOUR HEAD,

10:45.644 --> 10:48.064
AND YOU JUST NEED TO <i> GET AWAY.</i>

10:48.147 --> 10:52.318
- MAYBE THEY COULD FIND A <i> HOBBY</i>
THEY BOTH <i> LIKE.</i>

11:00.493 --> 11:01.577
- OH, OH, WOW.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.329
I GOT TO BE IN ST. LOUIS WHEN?

11:03.412 --> 11:05.289
I GOT TO GO.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.416
- BUT--NO!
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.293
- IT'S LIKE SHE SAID,
GET A HOBBY, GUYS.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.419
- WHAT ABOUT US?

11:10.503 --> 11:13.756
- WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN
GET STEVE HARVEY TO HELP YOU.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.758
I MEAN, HE'S SO FUNNY.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.134
[chuckles]
YOU KNOW...

11:17.218 --> 11:19.804
[as Steve Harvey]
"SURVEY SAID COTTAGE CHEESE."

11:19.887 --> 11:22.848
[chuckles]
YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.859
- WELL,
THERE GOES OUR LAST HOPE.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.112
- WELL, JOY,

11:36.195 --> 11:38.280
SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE
FACING CERTAIN DEATH,

11:38.364 --> 11:41.575
SEX HELPS THEM TO LIVE THOSE
LAST MOMENTS TO THE FULLEST.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.620
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE THINGS
AND PEOPLE YOU DON'T DO

11:44.703 --> 11:47.790
THAT YOU REGRET.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.418
- WHAT PART OF YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND

11:50.501 --> 11:53.129
THAT WE ARE NEVER GOING
TO SLEEP TOGETHER?

11:53.212 --> 11:57.550
- OH, I THINK YOU KNOW
WHICH PART.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.639
- WE HAVE GOT TO THINK QUICKLY,
OKAY?

12:03.722 --> 12:05.307
MAMIE SUE IS DISTRACTING THEM,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.476
BUT THERE'S ONLY SO LONG
SHE CAN TALK ABOUT SCRAPBOOKING.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.480
- WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.650
- I JUST--I WISH THERE WAS
SOME WAY WE COULD CALL FOR HELP.

12:14.733 --> 12:18.154
- OH, OH, THERE'S A FIREPLACE.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.114
I LEARNED TO MAKE SMOKE SIGNALS
WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.615
- OH.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.909
DID YOU LEARN THAT ON YOUR
PLAYDATES WITH SITTING BULL?

12:26.704 --> 12:28.497
- WHAT WAS YOUR INDIAN NAME?

12:28.581 --> 12:31.625
SLEEPS-WITH-EVERYONE?

12:33.085 --> 12:34.795
- WELL, AS MUCH
AS I ENJOY A SPICY CATFIGHT,

12:34.879 --> 12:37.298
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.341
[groans]

12:39.425 --> 12:41.719
ALL RIGHT, WELL, MAYBE IF I WAS
TO TAKE OFF ALL MY CLOTHES,

12:41.802 --> 12:43.888
AND YOU WERE TO SLATHER
MY NAKED BODY WITH OIL,

12:43.971 --> 12:45.848
I COULD SLIP
THROUGH THAT WINDOW.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.475
- OR I COULD TRY GETTING OUT
OF IT.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.976
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT IT STILL MIGHT HELP

12:49.059 --> 12:50.853
IF YOU SLATHERED MY BODY
WITH OIL.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.522
- JUST GIVE ME A HAND.
- FINE.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.858
HERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT, CAREFUL.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.027
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.571
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

13:00.654 --> 13:02.656
- JOY AND I ARE MAKING LOVE.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.996
AND THEY'RE TIMING US.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.665
- COME ON, YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET HER OUT OF THAT WINDOW.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.334
- YES, BUT NOT TO ESCAPE.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.877
YOU SEE,
SHE LIKES TO DO IT OUTDOORS,

13:14.960 --> 13:18.881
AND I ENJOY DOING IT INDOORS.

13:18.964 --> 13:22.551
THIS WAY, WE'RE BOTH SATISFIED.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.679
AND WE'RE DONE.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.723
MELANIE,
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKED?

13:31.977 --> 13:35.231
- OH, YOU LOOK AMAZING
IN MY LADYPANTS.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.857
OKAY, NOW DO THE COMMERCIAL.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.692
- [sighs]
OKAY.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.736
IT'S MY WEDDING DAY,

13:40.819 --> 13:43.197
AND I TURN TO THE CAMERA
AND SAY,

13:43.280 --> 13:45.741
"MY GROOM DOESN'T KNOW IT,
BUT I'M GOING RIGHT NOW.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.036
THANK YOU, MRS. LADYPANTS."

13:52.456 --> 13:53.541
- [clapping]

13:53.624 --> 13:54.917
OKAY,
NOW DO MY FAVORITE COMMERCIAL.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.293
IT'S WHERE YOU'RE
AT THE THEATER,

13:56.377 --> 13:58.587
AND THERE'S A LONG LINE
FOR THE LADIES' ROOM,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.631
AND YOU JUST...

14:00.714 --> 14:02.967
WINK AT THE CAMERA.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.302
YOU JUST...

14:05.386 --> 14:06.136
WINK.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.431
- UH, LOOK,
UM, YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.560
I ALREADY DID AS YOU ASKED.
I PUT ON YOUR LADYPANTS.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.936
I DID THE COMMERCIAL.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.479
NOW, YOU SAID
I COULD USE YOUR PHONE.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.355
- PLEASE?

14:16.438 --> 14:17.940
GIVE ME A SNEAK PEEK
AT THE NEXT ONE?

14:18.023 --> 14:19.066
- I CAN'T.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.234
THERE'S NOT GONNA
BE ANOTHER ONE.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.069
- WHAT?

14:22.152 --> 14:25.573
- WELL, I'M ENDING MY CONTRACT
WITH THE LADYPANTS PEOPLE.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.992
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.749
- YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.419
BLOW ONE, THEN TWO.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.629
ONE, THEN TWO.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.424
- ELKA, YOU'RE BEING
AS DEMANDING AND BOSSY

14:43.507 --> 14:44.883
AS CHRISTIAN GREY.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.803
I AM NOT YOUR SUBMISSIVE.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.015
- JUST DO IT.

14:51.098 --> 14:54.143
- OKAY.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.186
- ALL RIGHT,
NEW PLAN:

14:56.270 --> 14:58.439
WE DRIVE A WEDGE
BETWEEN CHESTER AND LILY

14:58.522 --> 15:00.107
AND GET ONE OF THEM
ON OUR SIDE.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.317
- I HEAR YOU.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.319
YOU WANT ME TO USE
MY DEVASTATING CHARM

15:03.402 --> 15:05.321
TO SEDUCE LILY.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.031
- CHESTER'S THE ONE
WITH THE WANDERING EYE.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.532
SOMEONE HAS TO FLIRT
WITH CHESTER.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.159
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL NEED A PAIR
OF SHORT SHORTS

15:10.242 --> 15:12.328
AND A COUPLE OF SHOTS
OF RUM IN ME.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.329
- [chuckles]

15:13.412 --> 15:15.372
I'LL FLIRT WITH CHESTER.
- OH!

15:17.458 --> 15:19.752
- YOU KNOW, LILY,

15:19.835 --> 15:21.462
WE WERE JUST SAYING

15:21.545 --> 15:22.838
HOW AMAZING YOU ARE

15:22.921 --> 15:26.175
AND HOW CHESTER DOESN'T
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.635
- I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM RIGHT NOW

15:27.718 --> 15:29.970
SHAMELESSLY FLIRTING
WITH MELANIE.

15:30.054 --> 15:30.971
- [giggles]

15:31.055 --> 15:33.265
YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.484
- I ORDER YOU TO UNTIE ME.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.694
- NOT UNTIL YOU SWEAR
YOU'LL SIGN A NEW CONTRACT

15:45.778 --> 15:47.613
WITH THE LADYPANTS PEOPLE.

15:47.696 --> 15:48.614
- OH, MY GOD.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.158
THIS IS JUST LIKE THAT MOVIE
WITH KATHY BATES

15:51.241 --> 15:54.703
BASED ON THE STEPHEN KING NOVEL
OF THE SAME NAME.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.163
-<i> FRIED GREEN TOMATOES?</i>

15:56.246 --> 15:58.666
- OOH, SORRY.
THAT'S WRONG.

15:58.749 --> 16:03.379
THE RESPONSE WE WANTED WAS,
"WHAT IS <i> MISERY?"</i>

16:03.462 --> 16:06.048
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT <i> FRIED GREEN TOMATOES</i> IS

16:06.131 --> 16:08.759
FROM THE NOVEL BY FANNIE FLAGG.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.345
- STOP BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL,
TREBEK.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.513
- EASY DOES IT.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.514
EASY, EASY.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.391
- HE IS SUCH A KNOW-IT-ALL.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.768
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

16:17.851 --> 16:22.106
ALTHOUGH THAT <i> MISERY</i> MOVIE HAS
SOME GOOD IDEAS.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.358
I BET THERE'S A MALLET
IN THE KITCHEN.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.943
[laughs]

16:26.026 --> 16:28.779
AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE THIS GUN
TANTALIZINGLY OUT OF YOUR REACH.

16:28.862 --> 16:29.905
[laughs]
OH, MY GOD.

16:29.988 --> 16:30.739
I FEEL LIKE A BOND VILLAIN.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.826
[cackling]

16:35.661 --> 16:36.787
- WAIT.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.372
IF HE'S A BOND VILLAIN,

16:38.455 --> 16:40.290
THEN THAT MAKES ME BOND.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.251
OH, THINK, VICTORIA.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.712
WHAT WOULD DANIEL CRAIG DO IF
HE WERE TIED UP IN LADYPANTS...

16:47.673 --> 16:50.300
WITH A PITCHER OF WATER NEARBY?

16:56.557 --> 16:59.143
- IT'S LIKE
HE DOESN'T EVEN SEE ME.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.437
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL
LIKE HIS EMPLOYEE

17:01.520 --> 17:02.938
AND NOT HIS WIFE.

17:03.021 --> 17:06.900
- WELL, MIXING BUSINESS
AND PLEASURE RARELY ENDS WELL.

17:06.983 --> 17:12.656
I HAVE A COWORKER
WHO'S ATTRACTED TO ME...

17:12.740 --> 17:17.703
LIKE A DESPERATE MOTH TO AN
ENCHANTING GINGER-HAIRED FLAME.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.954
- IS IT A GUY?

17:20.038 --> 17:21.790
- [laughs]
NO.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.251
NO, JOY IS NOT A GUY.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.295
[groans]

17:26.377 --> 17:28.630
- I'M JUST SAYING,
SHOULD THE POLICE COME

17:28.714 --> 17:30.257
AND TAKE CHESTER AWAY,

17:30.340 --> 17:32.301
YOU COULD DEFINITELY
FIND SOMEONE BETTER,

17:32.384 --> 17:34.636
LIKE ON EHARMONY.COM.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.806
THEY HAVE A PATENTED SYSTEM
THAT ENSURES COMPATIBILITY.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.102
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.479
I DESERVE BETTER.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.480
[clears throat]

17:44.563 --> 17:45.481
CHESTER.
- YEAH?

17:45.564 --> 17:46.815
- IT'S OVER.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.818
- OH, COME ON, BABE,
WILL YOU STOP IT, PLEASE?

17:49.902 --> 17:52.112
SHE MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.447
- PROVE IT.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.615
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

17:54.698 --> 17:56.325
KILL HER?

17:56.408 --> 17:59.369
- IT WOULD BE A NICE GESTURE.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.163
I MEAN,
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?

18:01.246 --> 18:03.332
- SWEETIE,
IF IT'LL HELP US GET PAST THIS,

18:03.415 --> 18:05.000
I WILL SHOOT
THAT WOMAN RIGHT NOW.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.043
[all screaming]

18:06.126 --> 18:07.294
[whistle chirping]

18:07.377 --> 18:08.921
- WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S THE COPS.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.048
AND YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.342
- YOU ALL JUST THOUGHT
I WAS TENDING THE FIRE

18:13.425 --> 18:16.095
WHILE ELKA NITPICKED
MY TECHNIQUE,

18:16.178 --> 18:18.764
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY MAKING
SMOKE SIGNALS

18:18.847 --> 18:21.058
WHILE ELKA NITPICKED
MY TECHNIQUE.

18:21.141 --> 18:22.518
[pounding]

18:22.601 --> 18:24.436
- THAT MUST BE
THE SWAT TEAM.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.985
- I SAW YOUR SMOKE SIGNALS.
ARE YOU IN DISTRESS?

18:34.112 --> 18:36.698
- YOU'RE NOT THE SWAT TEAM.
YOU'RE A LITTLE BOY.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.659
- THAT'S RIGHT, MA'AM.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.834
- OH, NO.
WHO'S GONNA SAVE US NOW?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.001
- DROP YOUR GUNS!

18:52.297 --> 18:56.718
THE NAME IS PANTS--
LADYPANTS.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.053
- HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?

18:58.136 --> 18:59.555
- I DOUSED MYSELF WITH WATER

18:59.638 --> 19:01.932
AND USED THE EXPANDING POWERS
OF MRS. LADYPANTS

19:02.015 --> 19:04.560
TO BREAK MY ROPES.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.562
- SHUT UP!

19:06.645 --> 19:08.272
YOU'RE AN EVIL GENIUS.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.315
- SHE'S THE BAD GUY.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.571
- NO, SHE'S NOT.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.739
I'M THE BAD GUY.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.076
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT MAKES ME THE GOOD GUY.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.077
DROP YOUR WEAPON.
- OOH.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.203
- YOU TOO, LADY.

19:28.375 --> 19:32.462
- OH, MY GOD.
ALEX TREBEK?

19:32.546 --> 19:34.089
- THAT'S RIGHT,
BUT ON WEEKENDS,

19:34.173 --> 19:37.050
I'M PARK RANGER ALEX TREBEK.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.428
AND I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.722
I READ YOUR SMOKE SIGNALS

19:41.805 --> 19:45.225
TELLING ME
THAT THERE WERE WOMEN HERE IN...

19:45.309 --> 19:47.436
JEOPARDY.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.653
- THE POLICE WILL BE HERE SOON.

19:56.737 --> 20:01.283
