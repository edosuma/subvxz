00:50.759 --> 00:52.236
You wanna give it a break?

00:52.322 --> 00:54.525
That shrub can
only take so much.

00:54.634 --> 00:55.869
Thanks to
Rapunzel and her

00:55.955 --> 00:57.478
little trick at
the great tree,

00:57.564 --> 00:59.689
I have to relearn everything
using this hand,

00:59.807 --> 01:01.357
so breaks aren't
really an option.

01:01.442 --> 01:03.626
Plus, we all
need to be on our A-game.

01:03.711 --> 01:05.181
This is
Westrabbit Woods.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.165
There are wild boars.

01:07.876 --> 01:10.446
- Slayer Wolves.
- Double....

01:10.893 --> 01:12.843
And...
jumping spiders.

01:13.054 --> 01:14.931
Wha?! Spiders?!

01:21.062 --> 01:22.879
I get why Cass
is mad at me...

01:22.964 --> 01:25.384
She told me not to
use the decay spell

01:25.470 --> 01:28.603
back at the tree, and I did,
and she hurt her hand.

01:31.039 --> 01:34.123
But if she had just listened
to me and stayed out of it,

01:34.208 --> 01:36.040
this all could have
been avoided!

01:36.181 --> 01:37.790
And I feel like we
could work things out,

01:37.876 --> 01:40.955
but she refuses
to talk about it!

01:41.437 --> 01:42.736
Wow...

01:43.165 --> 01:46.803
Ugh, I didn't mean to make
her look that angry...

01:46.947 --> 01:50.017
You're right. I gotta find a
way to get her to talk to me.

01:50.165 --> 01:51.727
Rapunzel!

01:51.970 --> 01:53.057
They're back.

01:53.298 --> 01:55.151
You'll never
guess what yours truly

01:55.237 --> 01:56.973
spotted with his gorgeous,
brown eyes!

01:59.927 --> 02:01.958
The caravan!

02:02.044 --> 02:03.278
Yep, found it
myself.

02:03.371 --> 02:04.722
Well, Max helped.

02:05.613 --> 02:06.629
Max found it.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.458
But I was instrumental in
that I did not get in the way.

02:09.544 --> 02:12.926
You guys,
this is amazing!

02:25.333 --> 02:27.599
Uh, allow me.

02:33.863 --> 02:35.794
I believe my
work here is done.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.021
How are we gonna get these two
back together without Hook Foot?

02:38.106 --> 02:40.184
Don't worry, buddy.
We'll figure something out.

02:40.270 --> 02:43.693
It's just gonna take a
little TLC and a lot of glue.

02:43.778 --> 02:45.966
And a whole
bunch of parts.

02:47.864 --> 02:49.065
No problem!

02:49.150 --> 02:51.034
Cass and I are
on the case.

02:51.223 --> 02:53.785
We'll go
get supplies.

02:54.230 --> 02:55.786
Sounds good to me.

02:56.715 --> 02:59.606
Pascal, um, you
stay here, okay?

02:59.692 --> 03:02.078
I need a little
one-on-one time with Cass.

03:04.541 --> 03:06.692
So, lately, I just can't seem

03:06.778 --> 03:08.995
to stop thinking about
Attila's cupcakes.

03:09.103 --> 03:11.418
It's like when you have
a song stuck in your head,

03:11.504 --> 03:14.692
but it's a taste that's stuck
in my head, isn't that funny?

03:14.902 --> 03:18.629
Anyway,
what about you, Cass?

03:18.736 --> 03:20.653
Anything on
your mind?

03:20.739 --> 03:24.058
- Piranhas.
- Really? Oof, that's upsetting,

03:24.144 --> 03:26.068
maybe we should talk
about that.

03:26.154 --> 03:27.496
No.

03:33.961 --> 03:35.527
Really big piranhas.

03:35.695 --> 03:38.949
This place is called
Westrabbit Woods.

03:39.174 --> 03:41.853
Okay, that's a little
disingenuous.

03:42.470 --> 03:45.043
We'll have to use these
trees to get across.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.225
Cass! Uh, let me
help you...

03:57.325 --> 04:00.530
No! I'm fine,
Rapunzel. Really.

04:09.126 --> 04:11.616
Looks like there's a town
just over this hill.

04:11.702 --> 04:13.819
Let's be sure before
we climb it.

04:17.483 --> 04:19.279
Ah, Owl's here.

04:19.413 --> 04:22.522
You know, I kinda thought this
could just be the two of us.

04:22.974 --> 04:28.368
Oh. Right. He-He just wanted
to stretch his wings, so...

04:33.321 --> 04:35.673
Oh wow. Looks like
the black rocks

04:35.759 --> 04:37.643
pushed everyone
out of this village.

04:37.813 --> 04:39.836
Nothing we can do now.

04:40.916 --> 04:43.600
Come on, we've got to look through
all of this before the sun sets.

04:43.686 --> 04:45.242
Look at this, Cass!

04:45.351 --> 04:47.390
It's an apothecary cart!

04:47.539 --> 04:51.020
It's got all kinds of tonics
and powders and...

04:51.495 --> 04:54.123
Oh, wow, a snow potion!

04:54.257 --> 04:55.804
Raps, come on.

04:55.964 --> 04:58.115
None of this junk works.

05:02.877 --> 05:04.077
Oh, touché.

05:04.163 --> 05:07.203
But we're not going to fix
the caravan by freezing it.

05:08.697 --> 05:11.195
"Wand of Oblivium."
Hmm.

05:11.392 --> 05:13.276
"Erases what you
wish to forget."

05:13.361 --> 05:15.695
Ooh, a memory wand!

05:15.887 --> 05:17.620
I wonder if it works?

05:19.462 --> 05:24.132
Ooh, a memory wand!
I wonder if it works?

05:25.855 --> 05:28.373
Ooh, a memory wand.

05:28.804 --> 05:30.626
Did I get you?

05:30.711 --> 05:32.528
Very funny.

05:33.484 --> 05:35.838
Too bad there's not an
"open-up-to-your-best-friend-

05:35.924 --> 05:38.377
about-the-thing-you-guys-are-fighting.
- about" wand, huh?

05:38.492 --> 05:41.640
- What was that?
- Cass, I know you're mad at me.

05:41.789 --> 05:43.640
But I did the right thing.

05:43.742 --> 05:46.876
- I didn't have a choice.
- Look, if you feel that way,

05:46.961 --> 05:48.311
then it's fine.
We're good.

05:48.396 --> 05:51.130
Come on, we should set up
camp for the night.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.721
I can't sleep.

06:06.142 --> 06:08.510
Rapunzel, it's only
been two minutes.

06:08.596 --> 06:10.080
Give it some time.

06:10.189 --> 06:14.143
Cass, I need to talk about what we
both know is going on between us.

06:14.318 --> 06:15.834
Raps, there's nothing
to talk about.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.830
- I never said I was upset.
- You don't have to.

06:18.924 --> 06:19.948
Oh, yeah?

06:20.034 --> 06:22.573
What makes you so sure
you know how I'm feeling?

06:22.768 --> 06:25.848
Friends just...
have a way of knowing.

06:30.909 --> 06:32.526
Raps, I said it's fine.

06:32.612 --> 06:34.757
And you keep saying that.

06:34.842 --> 06:37.059
But it's okay
if you're mad at me.

06:37.144 --> 06:38.854
I'm mad at you, too.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.092
I told you that I had it under
control and you didn't listen.

06:42.178 --> 06:45.029
So if you're upset,
then just tell me.

06:45.116 --> 06:48.690
And I told you
I'm not upset... Ow!

06:49.953 --> 06:51.740
Please, Cass,
I just want things

06:51.826 --> 06:53.166
to get better
between us.

06:53.252 --> 06:56.736
We can't just push this aside and
forget it, like it never happened!

06:56.831 --> 07:01.025
You know, I wish you would just
forget about the whole thing!

07:14.077 --> 07:15.837
What?

07:23.652 --> 07:28.298
Who are you,
and how did I get here?

07:30.790 --> 07:34.641
Answer me! How did you
get me out from my tower?

07:34.769 --> 07:36.423
You really don't remember?

07:36.509 --> 07:37.520
Was it magic?

07:37.605 --> 07:39.155
Did you do
magic to me?

07:39.240 --> 07:40.603
It has to be magic.

07:40.689 --> 07:43.774
I mean, Mother said people will
try anything to steal my hair.

07:43.991 --> 07:46.375
I was just in the tower
two seconds ago,

07:46.484 --> 07:47.666
and now I'm here,

07:47.752 --> 07:50.962
so magic is really the
only possible explanation.

07:51.048 --> 07:52.048
Oh my gosh!

07:52.134 --> 07:55.271
Mother must be so
worried, Pascal, too.

07:55.356 --> 07:57.373
Hey, don't
give me that look, okay?

07:57.458 --> 07:59.942
I didn't mean to erase her memory
all the way back to the tower!

08:00.027 --> 08:02.878
So, you did use some kind
of magic on me, didn't you?

08:02.963 --> 08:04.930
Uh...

08:05.646 --> 08:08.708
No, no, I didn't
use magic on you.

08:08.794 --> 08:11.479
But the reason you don't
remember leaving your tower

08:11.672 --> 08:14.396
was because...
ruffians.

08:14.482 --> 08:15.932
Ruffians used
magic on you.

08:16.143 --> 08:17.278
Ruffians?

08:19.213 --> 08:20.700
Yep.

08:22.138 --> 08:24.263
Mother told me
to watch out for those!

08:24.435 --> 08:28.091
And quicksand, uh, snapping
turtles, molten lava,

08:28.177 --> 08:31.173
poison ivy, puppets,
guys on stilts,

08:31.258 --> 08:34.677
the plague, riptides,
wooden shoes...

08:34.763 --> 08:36.183
Ooh, pointy teeth.

08:36.270 --> 08:37.918
Did those ruffians
have pointy teeth?

08:38.004 --> 08:39.721
Oh! They're
the pointiest!

08:39.807 --> 08:41.624
An-and they were after
your hair, of course,

08:41.793 --> 08:43.977
so-so they put you
under a sleeping spell

08:44.071 --> 08:45.988
so they could steal
you from your tower.

08:46.073 --> 08:50.497
But you see, I... I rescued
you from the thieves.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.716
Look, look, look, look,
look, I'm on your side!

08:52.802 --> 08:54.697
You have to get back
home to your mom, right?

08:54.782 --> 08:58.401
I can take you there, you
just have to untie me first.

08:58.521 --> 09:01.036
How do I know
I can trust you?

09:01.224 --> 09:02.646
I promise.

09:02.732 --> 09:05.810
And when I make a
promise, I never break it.

09:06.026 --> 09:09.091
Me, neither. Promises
mean a lot to me, too.

09:09.177 --> 09:11.935
I never break them,
ever.

09:13.674 --> 09:15.825
- I'm Rapunzel!
- Cassandra.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.124
So nice
to meet you!

09:18.210 --> 09:21.505
You try anything funny,
and I will pan you.

09:35.815 --> 09:38.443
Okay, there's gotta be something
here that can fix her memory.

09:38.529 --> 09:42.794
So are you gonna
take me home or what?

09:42.939 --> 09:45.786
Uh, just a minute,
packing a few things!

09:47.450 --> 09:49.794
No, I'm not going to tell
her what happened!

09:49.880 --> 09:52.154
It'd turn into this whole big
discussion about our feelings,

09:52.239 --> 09:54.364
and I don't do
touchy-feely.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.293
Ugh, the thought of
opening up makes me queasy.

09:57.378 --> 09:59.443
Now, help me do this!

10:00.072 --> 10:01.471
Ah!

10:02.373 --> 10:04.257
Here.

10:06.221 --> 10:07.351
Hmm...

10:07.437 --> 10:08.937
"The Wand of Oblivium
can be reversed

10:09.023 --> 10:11.224
with a simple potion,
as follows..."

10:14.293 --> 10:17.218
I might have called
it simple if it had 52 fewer ingredients,

10:17.304 --> 10:19.124
but
hey, to each his own.

10:19.429 --> 10:23.452
Trust me, collecting them while we
"lead her home" is our best bet.

10:23.571 --> 10:26.138
I'll undo the spell, and
she never has to know.

10:34.663 --> 10:36.312
It's just...

10:36.842 --> 10:39.701
I've never walked
on grass before.

10:41.046 --> 10:43.655
Well, I'm sure you'll do great.

10:50.392 --> 10:51.415
Come on.

10:51.501 --> 10:54.483
Wait! There's no lava
around here, right?

10:54.569 --> 10:56.818
No, you're good.
Lava-free.

10:56.904 --> 10:58.929
Now, come on,
let's keep moving.

11:05.121 --> 11:07.999
Rapunzel!

11:09.851 --> 11:12.444
It's so cute!

11:15.983 --> 11:19.687
Look at this! Oh my gosh,
look at this one!

11:19.773 --> 11:21.390
Oh! Look at this one!
Look at this...

11:21.476 --> 11:23.795
Whoa! Poison ivy.

11:27.482 --> 11:30.265
- This is so fun!
- Ahh!

11:31.446 --> 11:32.671
Oh!

11:33.898 --> 11:39.499
Woo-hoo!
Best day ever!

11:42.999 --> 11:45.304
Whoa!
What's that?

11:45.452 --> 11:47.421
Oh! It's, uh...

11:47.554 --> 11:49.538
I-I-it's a cookbook!

11:49.624 --> 11:50.757
I'm making soup.

11:50.843 --> 11:55.624
A really super special soup.

11:55.863 --> 11:59.163
I love soup, too!

11:59.249 --> 12:01.300
Mother always makes
it for my birthday.

12:01.386 --> 12:04.671
Oh! We need to get you this
special spice Mother uses,

12:04.757 --> 12:08.608
it's called "minne," it has this
bright, blue flower and it's so good!

12:08.776 --> 12:10.890
No, no, no, that'd be
too much trouble.

12:10.976 --> 12:13.835
I don't want my soup to hold you
up from getting back to your tower.

12:13.921 --> 12:16.405
You do want to get back as
soon as possible, don't you?

12:16.550 --> 12:18.116
Of course I do!

12:25.490 --> 12:26.975
Don't give me that look.

12:27.061 --> 12:28.411
We did it, didn't we?

12:28.497 --> 12:29.980
That's the last of
the ingredients.

12:30.066 --> 12:31.950
Raps! Let's get going.

12:32.104 --> 12:36.490
Rapunzel? Oh, no.
Where did she go now?

12:42.041 --> 12:46.936
Got it! Cassandra
will be so surprised!

12:47.272 --> 12:51.316
Hey! That's my minne!

12:54.550 --> 12:57.317
Ugh... Whoa!

13:01.433 --> 13:02.799
Bad goat!

13:22.136 --> 13:25.020
No! Aah!

13:25.304 --> 13:29.288
No... no, no,
no, no, no, no!

13:30.351 --> 13:33.405
No, you're not a bad goat,
are you?

13:33.491 --> 13:36.116
No, no you're
a good goat!

13:36.273 --> 13:39.124
You're a good goat, and you're
gonna let me have the minne,

13:39.210 --> 13:41.817
so Cassandra can
make a good soup.

13:41.902 --> 13:44.304
Ugh!

13:45.213 --> 13:47.822
Raps? Raps!

13:49.543 --> 13:53.028
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

13:53.164 --> 13:55.531
Give me my minne!

14:01.955 --> 14:04.322
Aah!

14:09.603 --> 14:12.079
 Let's get
out of here, shall we?

14:12.657 --> 14:16.418
I'm so sorry, I didn't
mean to cause any trouble.

14:16.503 --> 14:18.438
The minne was
right there,

14:18.524 --> 14:20.485
and I just really wanted you
to have it

14:20.571 --> 14:23.040
since you've been doing
so much for me.

14:23.126 --> 14:25.059
It's not a big deal,
Raps, really.

14:25.211 --> 14:29.165
No, Cass. Saving my
life is a big deal.

14:29.251 --> 14:31.056
Thank you so much.

14:31.318 --> 14:34.306
Not just for this,
but for everything.

14:34.431 --> 14:37.740
I am so lucky to have someone
like you that I can trust.

14:37.825 --> 14:40.884
I don't know what I'd
do here without you.

14:42.977 --> 14:44.618
Okay, well...

14:44.704 --> 14:46.615
that's enough for one
day, don't you think?

14:46.700 --> 14:48.330
We'll head north to
the tower in the morning.

14:48.416 --> 14:49.823
Okay.

14:57.644 --> 15:01.073
Hey, soup
smells good!

15:08.580 --> 15:10.639
It needs to simmer
overnight, remember?

15:10.705 --> 15:12.116
We can taste-test it
in the morning,

15:12.221 --> 15:13.729
and then we'll
head to the tower.

15:13.904 --> 15:18.604
Sure. I just... maybe
a small part of me

15:18.690 --> 15:20.393
doesn't want to go
back to the tower.

15:20.635 --> 15:23.485
Oh, wow, it feels good
to get that out.

15:23.658 --> 15:26.622
The world is just such
an amazing place,

15:26.707 --> 15:29.768
and I don't know if
I'm ready to give it up.

15:29.971 --> 15:33.291
I feel so bad saying this
because my mother only wants

15:33.377 --> 15:36.588
what's best for me, and the
world is kinda dangerous, but...

15:36.681 --> 15:40.560
- isn't that what makes it exciting?
- Why are you telling me this?

15:40.768 --> 15:42.205
Because we're friends.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.737
That's what
friends do, right?

15:44.823 --> 15:47.658
They tell each other
what's in their hearts.

15:48.693 --> 15:51.440
Well, good night.

15:57.027 --> 15:58.362
Raps?

16:00.707 --> 16:02.307
Good night.

16:12.185 --> 16:13.815
Oh, wow!

16:13.901 --> 16:16.452
The stars are so bright tonight!

16:16.600 --> 16:18.933
I've got to chart these.

16:23.479 --> 16:25.112
Wait.

16:25.964 --> 16:29.616
So, if the North Star
is there...

16:29.803 --> 16:32.612
We're going the wrong way!

16:33.607 --> 16:36.325
You're not taking me back
to the tower, are you?

16:36.410 --> 16:37.559
What are you
talking about?

16:37.644 --> 16:40.744
You said we were heading
north, but we're not.

16:40.846 --> 16:42.896
I chart stars, I know.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.783
Rapunzel, look.
I can explain.

16:45.869 --> 16:48.704
And why don't I
remember drawing this?

16:48.914 --> 16:50.080
Hmm?

16:50.708 --> 16:53.425
You did use some kind of
magic on me, didn't you?

16:53.533 --> 16:56.143
No, no, Raps,
that was the ruffians!

16:56.252 --> 16:57.880
I saved you from
them, remember?

16:57.965 --> 16:59.307
Maybe you did,

16:59.393 --> 17:01.901
but only because you
wanted my hair for yourself.

17:02.135 --> 17:05.782
And to think, I risked my
life getting you that spice.

17:05.907 --> 17:08.375
Mother was right
about everything!

17:12.776 --> 17:15.156
Okay, okay, so I shouldn't
have lied to her!

17:15.526 --> 17:20.008
We've got to find her before
she gets herself into trouble!

17:21.488 --> 17:23.005
Everything's gonna be okay,

17:23.089 --> 17:24.578
I can find the tower myself.

17:24.664 --> 17:27.182
I'll be okay, as long as
I don't run into any...

17:27.461 --> 17:28.693
Aah!

17:29.247 --> 17:30.245
Ruffians!

17:30.330 --> 17:31.724
- Where?
- Ruffians!

17:31.810 --> 17:34.544
I will not let you
steal my hair!

17:35.565 --> 17:37.882
You could probably
stop hugging me now.

17:42.309 --> 17:44.059
- Blondie!
- Princess!

17:44.144 --> 17:47.696
Long-haired girl whose
name I can't recall at the moment!

17:47.781 --> 17:49.231
- Princess!
- Rapunzel!

17:49.316 --> 17:50.632
They have Pascal!

17:50.717 --> 17:53.880
They are not gonna
get away with this!

17:54.020 --> 17:55.365
No time for details.

17:55.451 --> 17:56.951
We have to find Raps,
she lost her memory,

17:57.037 --> 17:58.105
she thinks she
never left the tower.

17:58.191 --> 17:59.724
We'll cover more ground
if we split up.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.474
Oh, boy, that's a lot
to take in.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.146
I'm gonna need
a moment.

18:03.864 --> 18:05.615
No, strike that,
that moment's not helping.

18:05.701 --> 18:06.817
Eugene! Focus!

18:06.903 --> 18:08.549
Right! We need to find her!
But hey...

18:08.635 --> 18:10.458
This is fresh-out-of-the-tower
Rapunzel, right?

18:10.544 --> 18:12.115
She's inexperienced.
We've got the upper hand!

18:14.871 --> 18:15.920
All right, Shorty,

18:16.006 --> 18:17.326
keep your
eyes peeled.

18:20.175 --> 18:21.475
Shorty?

18:21.671 --> 18:22.887
Shorty?

18:23.940 --> 18:25.011
Shorty?

18:29.156 --> 18:30.221
Huh?

18:52.212 --> 18:54.863
Oh... ow.

19:11.064 --> 19:12.587
Aah!

19:14.101 --> 19:15.247
Lance?

19:16.045 --> 19:17.152
And then, and then,

19:17.237 --> 19:18.622
it's, like, it just
came out of nowhere,

19:18.708 --> 19:21.893
it was like a stealthy,
jumping sp-p-p-p-pider ghost!

19:21.981 --> 19:24.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, what happened?

19:24.253 --> 19:25.948
Shorty!
She took him!

19:26.323 --> 19:27.455
She took him!

19:27.541 --> 19:29.363
Lance, he's right
over there.

19:29.449 --> 19:31.346
Yoo-hoo! Hey, fellas.

19:31.432 --> 19:34.446
Quick question: How good
are you at untying knots?

19:39.593 --> 19:41.377
Upside down,
we're upside down.

19:41.463 --> 19:42.810
Okay, Rapunzel,
maybe I should have

19:42.896 --> 19:43.879
given you a little
more credit.

19:43.964 --> 19:45.013
I mean, this is an
awesome trap,

19:45.098 --> 19:46.860
but you can
stand down.

19:49.133 --> 19:50.203
Huh?

19:56.709 --> 20:00.357
Let Pascal go,
or I will drop you!

20:00.490 --> 20:02.303
Look, Sunshine,
Pascal's just fine,

20:02.389 --> 20:04.412
but he's not with us, he's
actually looking for you...

20:04.498 --> 20:06.545
No! I don't believe you!

20:06.631 --> 20:10.038
Mother said everyone is a
liar and a thief out here...

20:10.123 --> 20:12.600
- and she was right.
- <i>Rapunzel!</i>

20:15.195 --> 20:17.779
You! You lied
to me, too!

20:17.864 --> 20:19.247
Don't try
to deny it!

20:19.332 --> 20:20.782
Is it possible
for this conversation

20:20.867 --> 20:22.117
to happen when
we're on the ground?

20:22.202 --> 20:23.935
If I get out of this,

20:24.020 --> 20:25.754
I promise I will never eat
another fish as long as I live!

20:25.839 --> 20:27.115
Except for tuna.

20:27.248 --> 20:29.065
And salmon... Aah!
Okay, just tuna!

20:29.276 --> 20:30.904
All right, all right!
Yes, yes...

20:30.990 --> 20:32.553
you're right,
Rapunzel, I did lie.

20:32.639 --> 20:33.961
I did use magic on you.

20:34.047 --> 20:36.731
And this potion will
bring back your memories.

20:36.816 --> 20:38.066
Memories?

20:38.151 --> 20:40.288
I erased some
of your memories.

20:40.374 --> 20:42.163
I didn't mean to, I...

20:42.801 --> 20:45.085
Look, I'm not big on
talking about feelings,

20:45.334 --> 20:47.835
and I didn't want to tell
you how mad I really was

20:47.921 --> 20:49.144
about what
happened at the tree.

20:49.229 --> 20:51.507
So I, I kept it
all in...

20:51.600 --> 20:53.047
until I lost my temper.

20:53.133 --> 20:56.609
And how do I know you're
not just lying again?

20:57.460 --> 21:00.648
Friends... just have
a way of knowing.

21:07.124 --> 21:10.281
- Oh, thank goodness.
- So long, evil fishes!

21:18.391 --> 21:20.122
Tell my story!

21:26.034 --> 21:28.567
And I could have beaten
the tree without the decay spell

21:28.653 --> 21:30.018
if you had
just trusted me.

21:30.103 --> 21:32.988
So, that's why I'm
still angry, Rapunzel.

21:33.239 --> 21:35.817
But still, I never should
have even touched that wand.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.348
It's okay, Cass.
I get it.

21:38.434 --> 21:39.942
But, Raps?

21:40.058 --> 21:41.775
I won't always
be mad at you.

21:42.027 --> 21:43.344
I'll get over it...

21:43.450 --> 21:44.992
that's what
friends do.

21:56.179 --> 21:57.421
Phew!

21:57.507 --> 21:59.242
See?
I told you we'd get 'em

21:59.328 --> 22:01.296
- back together.
- Yeah.
