17:04.557 --> 17:06.024
Right on the kitchen table.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.892
So, they lied to us.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.527
Well...

17:09.529 --> 17:10.728
That's not a big deal.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.630
It's not that they lied.

17:12.632 --> 17:16.000
It's that my idea of them as
this romantic couple was a lie.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.169
[ Sighs ] If that's what
they do on Valentine's day,

17:18.171 --> 17:20.705
then maybe they're not
who I thought they were.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.741
Yeah, well, I know
you think that romance

17:23.743 --> 17:26.377
is all about
the big gestures, huh?

17:26.379 --> 17:28.312
But it's about
the little things, too.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.314
You want to hear
the most romantic thing

17:32.485 --> 17:34.585
honey ever did for me?

17:34.586 --> 17:36.686
Well, one day,
I came home late from golf.

17:36.689 --> 17:40.892
And there on the table,
I saw a pair of over-easy eggs

17:40.894 --> 17:42.593
that honey had left for me.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.364
I ate them up, and I passed out
with the plate on my chest.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.534
And when I came to,
I looked down.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.536
What did I find?

17:51.738 --> 17:54.172
Another pair of eggs.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.108
She knew that I'd want more.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.210
More eggs.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.045
Those are the little things.

18:01.047 --> 18:04.549
That's romance, son.

18:04.551 --> 18:08.820
Emery, can you help your brother
in the kitchen?

18:12.459 --> 18:13.891
Oh, look.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.094
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Lucinda.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.362
Lucinda? [ Chuckles ]

18:18.364 --> 18:20.364
What, did she play fiddle
in a country-western band?

18:20.366 --> 18:21.766
She did, actually.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.434
You always were a good guesser.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.236
Why didn't you
tell me about her?

18:25.238 --> 18:28.039
I just didn't want you to think
I was bad at marriage.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.208
I mean, one divorce...
That's life.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.044
Two divorces? That's a pattern.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.614
Boopsy, I just didn't want
to give you another reason

18:36.616 --> 18:39.083
to think that
it wouldn't work out with me.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.385
Cuddlepuss, come here!

18:41.387 --> 18:42.453
Oh!

18:42.455 --> 18:43.455
[ Chuckles ]

18:45.325 --> 18:46.224
Both: Ohhhh.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.959
Guys...

18:47.961 --> 18:51.395
Goober grape is wonderful.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.264
[ Bass thumping ]

18:53.266 --> 18:54.499
Eddie: I can't believe it!

18:54.501 --> 18:56.100
Look how close we are
to the stage!

18:56.102 --> 18:57.668
We're front row! [ Gasps ]

18:57.670 --> 18:59.403
I bet Janet's
gonna do that thing

18:59.405 --> 19:01.005
where she's singing
and touching our hands.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.141
"Y'all having fun tonight?"

19:03.143 --> 19:05.510
Sorry, but you're at
the wrong entrance.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.248
Excuse me.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.416
Excuse me. Sorry.

19:12.418 --> 19:13.784
Sorry.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.254
Woman: Come on, Janet!

19:18.158 --> 19:20.625
Okay...

19:20.627 --> 19:22.660
This will be fine, I think.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.462
I can't see the stage.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.830
This must be Jimmy's fault.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.431
Terry wouldn't do this.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.634
¶¶

19:29.636 --> 19:32.503
[ cheers and applause ]
[ Janet speaking indistinctly ]

19:32.505 --> 19:34.972
Is that Janet?!
Who's saying that?!

19:34.974 --> 19:36.807
Does anybody have eyes on Janet?

19:36.809 --> 19:38.776
What is this pillar
even holding up?

19:38.778 --> 19:41.112
It doesn't even seem structural!

19:43.116 --> 19:45.449
How is our cable bill so cheap?

19:45.451 --> 19:46.817
Oh, I cancelled our account

19:46.819 --> 19:49.020
and I rejoined under my alias,
Sydney Jones.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.688
Got us a promotional rate
and free hbo.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.223
Thank God. I'd be furious

19:52.225 --> 19:54.559
if we were paying
for "Dennis Miller live."

19:54.561 --> 19:56.561
[ Chuckles ]

19:56.563 --> 19:58.663
I don't remember this, though.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.631
It's a bill for car repairs.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.300
Oh, right.
I had the Van serviced.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.968
I must have forgotten
to tell you.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.503
It's a lot of money, Louis.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.338
Well, I thought it was worth it.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.740
You were driving around
some big clients the next day,

20:09.742 --> 20:11.008
and I wanted to make sure

20:11.010 --> 20:12.843
you made the best impression
possible.

20:12.845 --> 20:16.948
Louis Huang. Not bad.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.893
Emery, what are you doing?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.362
Putting my love wall back up.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.065
Turns out romance isn't
what I thought it was.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.867
Sorry I've been kind of a jerk.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.169
Aw, it's okay, son.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.071
Sorry we lied to you
about our date night.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.940
You were quite the handful
the past couple of days.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.209
"I'm mad! I'm mad!" [ Chuckles ]

20:45.211 --> 20:47.278
Well, I wanted
to make up for it.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.647
So I made you this.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.683
Aww.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.452
You guys overpaid
in love this year,

20:54.454 --> 20:56.420
so you're getting 20% back.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.957
This is probably the wrong form,
but I appreciate it.

21:06.633 --> 21:10.101
¶ And I'll guarantee
they'll fall in line ¶

21:10.103 --> 21:11.602
¶ watch 'em all go ¶

21:11.604 --> 21:15.139
¶ damn, baby, baby ¶

21:15.141 --> 21:16.140
¶ watch 'em all go ¶

21:16.142 --> 21:20.044
¶ damn, baby, baby ¶

21:20.046 --> 21:20.911
