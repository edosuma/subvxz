00:01.227 --> 00:02.667
HARRY!

00:03.867 --> 00:05.587
Isabella tried to kill me.

00:06.450 --> 00:09.049
Find out where Isabella was the
night of the accident.

00:09.050 --> 00:11.689
A leak in the brake fluid
container of Harry's car.

00:11.690 --> 00:15.209
When he was out that night, he was
essentially driving without brakes.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.382
I don't think he believes it was an
accident.

00:17.970 --> 00:21.010
When I met you, I thought you must've
been sent.

00:21.170 --> 00:24.649
Rest assured we will find the
evidence to put you away for a

00:24.650 --> 00:25.690
long, long time.

00:26.130 --> 00:28.330
Goodbye Isabella.

00:29.090 --> 00:30.770
Alistair.

00:34.370 --> 00:37.729
I've got him.
Seventeen West Walk, Latimore Road.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.169
That's the road where I died.

00:39.170 --> 00:40.769
Why would Winter go there?

00:40.770 --> 00:43.890
I think he is serious trouble. Suri,
get back up.

01:24.570 --> 01:28.545
They say it looks like an accident.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.584
I've told them to look again.

01:32.570 --> 01:35.409
I thought Isabella only killed bad
men. That's what she said.

01:35.410 --> 01:36.775
People who deserved it.

01:38.210 --> 01:40.032
He was the best of men.

01:43.410 --> 01:47.423
So who's next? Could be anyone.

01:48.130 --> 01:50.289
I won't let there be anyone else.

01:50.290 --> 01:53.747
No? How you gonna stop her?

01:55.410 --> 01:56.849
What happened to Jay?

01:56.850 --> 01:59.936
I tried. I really tried to stop him.

02:00.490 --> 02:01.969
He's dead?

02:01.970 --> 02:06.289
Jay was not strong enough.
He's not like you.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.850
Harry, It's yours. It's meant for you.

02:09.443 --> 02:10.449
If you don't have

02:10.449 --> 02:14.254
Anna's taken me back.
And Daisy has never been happier.

02:14.255 --> 02:17.529
I will fight Isabella, I can beat
her without risking them in

02:17.530 --> 02:18.130
the process.

02:18.131 --> 02:20.969
For the first time in, I don't know
how long, I'm not looking

02:20.970 --> 02:22.649
- over my shoulder...
- If you don't have it

02:22.650 --> 02:25.289
I can go home with out thinking that
something terrible is gonna happen.

02:25.290 --> 02:26.760
You're normal again.

02:27.530 --> 02:29.409
- Yes.
- So how will you beat her?

02:29.410 --> 02:32.037
You've no chance without this.

02:34.930 --> 02:36.450
I don't want it.

03:09.610 --> 03:12.489
Ok, everyone...
Can I have your attention please?

03:12.490 --> 03:13.610
Listen up.

03:20.170 --> 03:22.249
I've just come from a meeting with
the Assistant Commissioner

03:22.250 --> 03:24.490
and the powers that be.
For now, I am taking charge.

03:25.377 --> 03:26.729
I don't wanna be in this position.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.329
I'm as upset here as anyone else.

03:28.330 --> 03:31.689
But we've got no time for that,
no time for grieving.

03:31.690 --> 03:32.610
Alright?

03:32.611 --> 03:35.057
We've only one case.
Drop everything else.

03:37.625 --> 03:40.290
DCI Winter's death was not an accident.

03:41.210 --> 03:42.690
It was murder.

03:44.009 --> 03:47.409
Carefully planned and pre-meditated
to make it look like an accident.

03:47.410 --> 03:50.889
By her. Isabella Augustin.

03:50.890 --> 03:53.129
I don't know if that's her real
name but I have an address for

03:53.130 --> 03:55.329
her, we have her details from
a previous arrest.

03:55.330 --> 03:58.529
She's got one known associate,
a driver called Rui Hirota.

03:58.530 --> 04:03.529
He drives a black Range Rover,
index plate is OY16YTK.

04:03.530 --> 04:05.609
We need to get officers
to her place now.

04:05.610 --> 04:06.929
I want S019s.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.489
I want roadblocks, in case
we've missed her.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.863
I want men on the street.
A cordon around her house. Come on!

04:11.570 --> 04:14.009
Oh, and I have to be there.
We've got no chance of catching

04:14.010 --> 04:15.271
her, unless I am there.

04:16.450 --> 04:18.408
I know her, okay.

04:21.432 --> 04:24.289
Harry. We all loved him.

04:24.290 --> 04:26.569
This doesn't need to be your
personal crusade.

04:26.570 --> 04:27.473
Hum Hum!

04:57.930 --> 04:59.970
- Armed police
- Get on the ground

04:59.971 --> 05:03.290
- Show your hands
- Get down on the floor.

05:05.850 --> 05:07.490
What the hell is going on?

05:16.730 --> 05:19.071
I keep telling you, I've never
heard of anyone called

05:19.072 --> 05:21.369
Isabella Whatserface.

05:21.370 --> 05:22.890
This is my home.

05:23.788 --> 05:25.520
Where have you been the
last three months?

05:25.521 --> 05:28.330
Holiday. Oh gardening leave actually.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.289
Left the old firm, decided to take
the family on a rather special trip.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.569
Tokyo, Maldives...

05:33.570 --> 05:34.410
And you don't know her?

05:34.411 --> 05:36.409
No. I've never heard of her.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.249
You didn't rent this place
out while you were away?

05:38.250 --> 05:40.810
What and risk someone damaging
the artwork? No thanks.

05:42.589 --> 05:45.489
So, you're telling me...

05:45.490 --> 05:47.689
Look, I know you cops aren't the
brightest bunch otherwise

05:47.690 --> 05:52.209
you'd get decent jobs, but for the
last time. I live here.

05:52.210 --> 05:53.210
I got back this morning.

05:53.211 --> 05:54.569
The place is just as I left it.

05:54.570 --> 05:56.889
I've never heard of your girl.
I can't help you.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.534
Is that clear enough?

06:31.970 --> 06:33.689
Just to keep you updated.

06:33.690 --> 06:35.889
Her photo's on all police
and NCA watchlists.

06:35.890 --> 06:38.969
We've got eighteen search patrols on
the streets, and I've got a

06:38.970 --> 06:41.369
special unit manning CCTV.

06:41.370 --> 06:42.969
No one can hide for long with all that.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.444
We will get her.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.569
I'm gonna go home, to get some sleep.

06:46.570 --> 06:51.449
Orwell's doing the night shift,
but when you are ready, I want to

06:51.450 --> 06:53.905
know all about Isabella Augustine.

07:06.690 --> 07:08.290
Thank you

07:16.650 --> 07:18.890
- Anna...
- I just heard. I'm so sorry.

07:21.450 --> 07:23.130
Was it her?

07:23.330 --> 07:24.690
Yeah.

07:26.490 --> 07:27.849
You alright?

07:27.850 --> 07:30.529
Yeah. No I'm fi, just err,
got a lot to organise.

07:30.530 --> 07:32.529
Why are you here?

07:32.530 --> 07:34.530
Am I allowed to tell you,
you look like shit?

07:35.063 --> 07:37.010
You could lie.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.209
Daisy's at a friends
tonight. It's just us.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.089
No I need to stay here, in
case we find her.

07:42.090 --> 07:45.569
No alright. We can, we can stay
nearby, we can go to a hotel.

07:45.570 --> 07:46.889
A hotel?

07:46.890 --> 07:48.930
Harry, you have to rest.

07:49.560 --> 07:53.849
Just for one night, otherwise
you'll be no use to anyone.

07:53.850 --> 07:55.977
Least of all Alistair.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.849
I didn't mean to wake you, I'm sorry.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.734
You didn't. The bed was
cold, that's all.

08:46.330 --> 08:48.250
She's out there. Somewhere.

08:48.741 --> 08:51.230
You can't catch her stuck in here.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.471
I don't know how to catch her, Anna.

08:57.370 --> 09:01.427
But she has to be stopped...
for Winter. For everyone.

09:04.943 --> 09:07.063
I'm the only person who can do it.

09:10.370 --> 09:12.434
- But I need...
- Some luck.

09:15.170 --> 09:16.610
I know.

09:19.970 --> 09:21.890
But I love you.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.770
But you have to catch her.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.370
But I love you.

10:13.130 --> 10:14.570
She has to be stopped.

10:15.536 --> 10:17.096
Do you really want this?

10:18.210 --> 10:21.113
It's my choice. I know what I'm doing.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.490
When you put the bracelet back on,

10:31.382 --> 10:34.970
you sacrifice all the things you love.

10:35.530 --> 10:37.450
It has to be worth something.

10:38.324 --> 10:39.690
Just get on with it.

10:45.090 --> 10:46.636
Are you ready?

11:07.370 --> 11:08.529
HARRY!

11:43.721 --> 11:47.330
Anna? Anna? Anna?

11:47.411 --> 11:49.530
- What?
- Get up! Get up!

11:49.531 --> 11:52.130
- What time is it?
- We have to get Daisy!

11:52.131 --> 11:54.610
- It's four in the morning.
- Isabella is here. I saw her.

11:54.611 --> 11:55.973
She saw the bracelet.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.731
You did it!

11:59.291 --> 12:01.410
She's gonna come for you. I know it.

12:01.411 --> 12:03.811
Or Daisy, or... look we need to go now.

12:17.211 --> 12:18.184
Rich?

12:19.504 --> 12:20.939
Rich are you there!

12:23.436 --> 12:24.788
Rich?

12:34.811 --> 12:37.079
Okay, all set?

12:42.411 --> 12:43.770
Will you be alright?

12:43.771 --> 12:45.250
I will if we catch her.

12:45.251 --> 12:47.890
Yeah well, look after Harry.
Relies on you more than you think.

12:47.891 --> 12:49.810
Ah, he does a good job hiding it.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.770
There's something about this case
he's not telling me...

12:51.771 --> 12:54.851
Yeah well. Good luck.

12:54.876 --> 12:56.111
See you later.

13:03.571 --> 13:07.130
Oh stupid thing! It's none sense!

13:07.131 --> 13:09.850
It's ridiculous! What's wrong with you?

13:09.851 --> 13:12.130
You alright. What's up?

13:12.131 --> 13:13.521
Do you know anything about engines?

13:14.155 --> 13:17.210
Not modern ones.
Only two stroke engine, anytime.

13:17.211 --> 13:19.051
Got a meeting in ten minutes.

13:20.971 --> 13:23.130
Come on Rich.

13:23.131 --> 13:25.835
Hi, you are through to Rich,
please leave a message.

13:27.331 --> 13:30.116
Dad. What about my things?

13:30.264 --> 13:31.730
I don't even have a phone charger.

13:31.731 --> 13:34.450
Well no. I'll, I'll get you another,
love. Don't worry.

13:34.451 --> 13:35.890
But my clothes, and my stuff...

13:35.891 --> 13:38.370
They've got shops there. They've got
more shops than you believe.

13:38.371 --> 13:39.970
You'll be able to buy
what ever you want.

13:39.971 --> 13:43.770
But it's Kerry's party on Friday,
and Adam's going and I promised

13:43.771 --> 13:46.370
them I'd be there and she'll hate me
and I'll have no friends and I...

13:46.371 --> 13:48.453
It's alright, it's alright.

13:50.611 --> 13:51.798
Dad.

13:53.211 --> 13:55.050
I don't wanna go.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.290
It's just for a little bit, love.

13:57.291 --> 14:00.429
Just to keep you out of harm's way.
Trust me, it'll be okay.

14:26.451 --> 14:27.608
Listen to me.

14:29.055 --> 14:32.210
I had to put this back on.

14:32.211 --> 14:33.731
You know that don't you?

14:36.051 --> 14:37.571
I don't want to go, Dad.

14:38.043 --> 14:42.211
I'm know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.716
We'll be fine.

14:49.231 --> 14:51.411
We'll be absolutely fine.

14:56.283 --> 14:59.883
Come on darling, it is New York,
you are going to love it.

15:16.908 --> 15:17.901
Suri.

15:17.902 --> 15:21.410
Harry. I think Isabella
has abducted Rich.

15:21.411 --> 15:23.210
A witness saw a man of his description

15:23.211 --> 15:25.690
being pushed into the boot of
the car, near my flat.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.930
He didn't get a full view of the
license plate, but it looks

15:27.931 --> 15:28.891
like Isabella's.

15:28.892 --> 15:31.610
He was with me, moments
before... I can't believe it.

15:31.611 --> 15:32.890
Okay.

15:42.731 --> 15:44.091
Okay.

15:47.411 --> 15:48.610
Have we heard anything yet.

15:48.611 --> 15:51.490
Nothing from his work, his mobile's
dead, but we don't know for sure

15:51.491 --> 15:53.370
I know. She's got him.

15:53.371 --> 15:56.050
A PNC camera picked up her car in
Mile End, but she went under

15:56.051 --> 15:58.050
a fly-over and we haven't been
able to track her since.

15:58.051 --> 16:00.851
We've alerted all branches,
everything is flagged.

16:03.331 --> 16:05.065
It won't do any good.

16:05.691 --> 16:07.571
Sure it will, we just have...

16:21.651 --> 16:22.971
This isn't like you.

16:25.091 --> 16:26.251
I've met my match.

16:27.251 --> 16:28.840
Impossible.

16:29.891 --> 16:32.251
Tell me about her. Tell me properly.

16:34.171 --> 16:35.171
We were lovers.

16:36.171 --> 16:38.530
I knew it. You bloody idiot.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.130
She seemed so perfect at first.

16:40.131 --> 16:43.410
The only person that really
knew me for what I was.

16:43.411 --> 16:47.210
Then it went too far, a bit crazy,
and next thing I know she's

16:47.211 --> 16:49.851
with Winter. She chose him because
of me.

16:49.971 --> 16:51.170
To get back at me.

16:51.171 --> 16:54.090
And now Rich, it's the same
thing. it's a message.

16:54.091 --> 16:58.211
A threat. My own brother.

17:00.171 --> 17:02.291
He really likes you, by the way.

17:02.593 --> 17:06.303
Me and my boyfriends.
The curse of Suri strikes again.

17:07.411 --> 17:09.987
We will get her. I know we will.

17:10.451 --> 17:12.821
If anyone can, you can.

17:14.011 --> 17:16.140
This is Rich, we can't give up.

17:21.971 --> 17:24.811
Steve, can you show us where
her car was last seen?

17:27.451 --> 17:32.930
Okay. She was heading East.
Camera picked her up around here.

17:32.931 --> 17:35.415
And then, I don't know, she disappeared.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.449
And then we've got cameras on
every road every junction.

17:37.450 --> 17:40.610
We've got a helicopter up there, but
by the time she hit the flyover...

17:40.611 --> 17:43.570
The problem is there's six
possible routes out of here.

17:43.571 --> 17:46.130
Even with all our coverage,
if she takes a smaller routes, then...

17:46.131 --> 17:47.690
she could be anywhere...

17:47.691 --> 17:50.090
It doesn't help that we've got two
cameras out on Bow Road, but

17:50.091 --> 17:51.850
even so, we should have something...

17:51.851 --> 17:53.890
- So what do we do?
- I don't know. We wait.

17:53.891 --> 17:54.771
Are you kidding me?

17:54.772 --> 17:57.366
By the time a camera picks her up,
she could in Essex, or Somerset,

17:57.367 --> 17:59.810
- or bloody Scotland.
- Well thank you. I'm aware of that!

17:59.811 --> 18:01.331
This is what we have!

18:04.517 --> 18:06.120
She's here.

18:07.771 --> 18:11.611
Fairfield Road... Bring up the
traffic feed on Fairfield Road.

18:12.937 --> 18:14.370
For any reason?

18:14.371 --> 18:15.531
Just do it, Steve?

18:21.931 --> 18:26.331
Turn the camera round onto
Wrexham Road? Come on.

18:28.811 --> 18:30.371
Come on.

18:33.531 --> 18:35.250
- There.
- What the hell...

18:35.251 --> 18:38.130
Let's go. I want S019
surrounding that car.

18:38.131 --> 18:41.251
And no one but no one
approaches until I'm there!

18:47.691 --> 18:50.811
Don't move, keep your hands
where I can see them.

18:56.851 --> 18:58.691
Don't shoot!

19:10.011 --> 19:11.851
Where is she?

19:12.091 --> 19:15.687
Don't you need to start the tape,
say your name, the time, all that

19:15.688 --> 19:17.035
Where is she?

19:18.491 --> 19:21.770
I have a message for you.
From your brother.

19:21.771 --> 19:23.291
It's on my mobile phone.

19:30.451 --> 19:32.531
- Where's his phone?
- Right there.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.410
Harry? Is it on?

19:40.411 --> 19:44.170
Harry, Jesus man, you need to get
here quick. Seriously.

19:44.171 --> 19:45.531
He's only gone and...

19:54.211 --> 19:56.341
- What do you want?
- You heard the tape?

19:56.361 --> 19:57.920
How did it make you feel?

19:57.921 --> 19:58.721
What do you want?

19:58.722 --> 20:01.138
She wants you to know that
she still loves you.

20:01.481 --> 20:02.640
Whatever you do to me.

20:02.641 --> 20:04.240
Where is my brother?

20:04.241 --> 20:07.840
You have to suffer,
Harry Clayton. Lose everything.

20:07.841 --> 20:11.201
Have it stripped away. So you can
see the world as she does.

20:11.675 --> 20:13.000
What do you mean?

20:13.001 --> 20:16.761
Once you're free, you'll
understand. It has to be.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.140
Your brother will die.

20:27.441 --> 20:29.160
Alright. Alright. No...

20:29.161 --> 20:31.960
Where's my brother? Where's my brother?!

20:31.961 --> 20:34.401
- Harry..
- I'll kill him.

20:55.113 --> 20:56.392
I'm not talking to you.

20:56.393 --> 20:59.152
We understand our colleague's
actions were unacceptable.

20:59.153 --> 21:01.712
I have delivered my message.
I have nothing more to say.

21:01.713 --> 21:04.021
Where is Isabella Augustin?

21:07.205 --> 21:09.752
You do realise you will be charged
with aiding and abetting

21:09.753 --> 21:11.993
- several murders?
- You won't catch her.

21:11.994 --> 21:13.100
Watch us.

21:13.101 --> 21:16.032
She's beyond you. She's beyond anyone.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.217
She's a Goddess.

21:19.273 --> 21:20.273
Course she is!

21:20.274 --> 21:23.232
You don't understand.
You haven't seen her.

21:23.233 --> 21:26.273
Not like she sees you.
She can see everything.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.501
She can see you now.

21:28.873 --> 21:30.912
I'm sure. Sure, okay I
think were done here.

21:30.913 --> 21:32.796
She'll watch you while you're sleeping.

21:45.673 --> 21:48.473
Interview terminated four fifty five...

21:51.073 --> 21:53.312
It's not an even fight.

21:53.313 --> 21:57.673
I have too many weaknesses.
Daisy, Anna, Rich, you...

21:58.431 --> 22:02.472
She has none. No one it
makes her too strong.

22:02.473 --> 22:06.072
I want to see her arrested,
I want to, have her put in jail, to,

22:06.073 --> 22:09.153
to feel justice, to see good win.

22:11.033 --> 22:13.017
But she's pure evil.

22:14.473 --> 22:16.143
What do I do?

22:17.073 --> 22:18.233
You already know.

22:20.113 --> 22:23.408
- You have to kill her.
- What?

22:24.153 --> 22:27.832
And if I do that, if I take a life;
the worst crime, Eve, the

22:27.833 --> 22:31.112
worst, everything I've spent my life
fighting against, then where

22:31.113 --> 22:32.279
will the bracelet take me?

22:33.973 --> 22:37.152
Isabella is me in ten years' time.

22:37.153 --> 22:43.843
She keeps telling me this,
if I kill her, I prove her right.

22:45.553 --> 22:47.540
If I kill her I lose.

22:47.953 --> 22:51.913
If you don't! We all lose.

23:10.193 --> 23:12.597
You don't think Harry's actions
are a little... extreme?

23:12.598 --> 23:15.913
It's his brother.
Yeah I know. He attacked a suspect.

23:16.406 --> 23:19.592
The brief makes a formal complaint,
then undoes all the good work.

23:19.593 --> 23:20.872
Are you suggesting we report him?

23:20.873 --> 23:24.192
No! I'm suggesting, you have a word,
calm him down, get him take a

23:24.193 --> 23:26.312
- back seat if necessary.
- But it's Rich

23:26.313 --> 23:29.712
Yeah. I understand Suri.

23:29.713 --> 23:31.273
I just trust Harry to find him.

23:31.667 --> 23:34.032
If you had to put your last
penny on one person...

23:34.033 --> 23:35.433
Who would it be?

23:37.193 --> 23:39.993
Okay. Let's just keep an
eye though, yeah?

23:40.540 --> 23:43.444
And you're wrong, by the way.

23:44.793 --> 23:47.876
You could bet on me. Your last penny.

23:48.673 --> 23:50.193
I wouldn't let you down.

23:54.833 --> 23:59.112
Harry? Is it on? Harry, Jesus Harry?

23:59.113 --> 24:00.392
Is it on?

24:00.393 --> 24:04.152
Harry, Jesus man, you need to get
here quick. Seriously.

24:04.153 --> 24:06.232
Harry? Is it on?

24:06.233 --> 24:09.992
Harry, Jesus man, you need to get
here quick. Seriously.

24:09.993 --> 24:11.747
He's only gone and

24:12.193 --> 24:15.913
Harry, Jesus man, you need to get
here quick. Seriously.

24:16.570 --> 24:19.153
Jesus man, you need to get

24:22.513 --> 24:25.672
And get me a timetable of today's
tides, and of the river

24:25.673 --> 24:28.272
ferries, all boat routes, any routes
you can. Now Come on.

24:28.273 --> 24:29.592
Okay, listen. Come here.

24:29.593 --> 24:30.798
Come here.

24:31.993 --> 24:33.473
Harry? Is it on?

24:33.922 --> 24:37.352
Harry, Jesus man, you have
to get here quick.

24:37.353 --> 24:40.672
Seriously. He's only gone and...
Harry, Jesus man...

24:40.673 --> 24:44.512
There, that's a tannoy.
That's a tannoy for a river ferry.

24:44.513 --> 24:47.472
So he's outside. Somewhere
near the Thames.

24:47.473 --> 24:48.992
And now listen to this...

24:48.993 --> 24:52.712
Harry?

24:52.713 --> 24:55.992
Those bells, that chime...
I know those bells...

24:55.993 --> 24:58.752
I used to work for Burmasy beat,
when I first came across the water.

24:58.753 --> 25:02.032
So, it's a church near a
river. It's there All Saints.

25:02.033 --> 25:04.912
So, depending on which way
the wind was blowing...

25:04.913 --> 25:07.352
Where's the met office
information I asked for?

25:07.353 --> 25:08.832
Depending on which way
the wind is blowing.

25:08.833 --> 25:12.272
Those bells where peal between here
and here. A two mile radius.

25:12.273 --> 25:13.792
But the ferries don't
stop at every pier...

25:13.793 --> 25:15.112
They stop here... here... and here,

25:15.113 --> 25:19.193
there are tannoy announcements on
every ferry... so... - Boss.

25:21.473 --> 25:25.232
The tide's rising. The tides rising.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.472
- Harry.
- No. No. You two stay here.

25:27.473 --> 25:28.788
I need you here.

25:41.033 --> 25:42.833
Come on Rich, where are you?

25:47.153 --> 25:50.232
Okay can you link to the river and
find out exactly where Harry is.

25:50.233 --> 25:51.319
Can you get me a...
a link to him as well?

25:51.344 --> 25:52.453
Steve!

25:53.753 --> 25:54.850
Suri?

25:56.603 --> 25:58.138
Are you okay?

25:58.953 --> 26:02.232
What if Rui isn't mad?
What if Isabella can see us?

26:02.233 --> 26:04.313
Right now, like he said?

26:15.473 --> 26:18.192
Harry Clayton left the
office twenty minutes ago.

26:18.193 --> 26:20.072
He's heading towards the river.

26:20.073 --> 26:22.432
I could put some red lights up to
slow him down, if you'd like.

26:22.433 --> 26:24.232
No. Let him go.

26:24.233 --> 26:28.152
Good luck to him. What about the
other two. Orwell and Chohan?

26:28.153 --> 26:31.352
They left shortly afterwards.
But I don't think they're with him.

26:31.353 --> 26:32.772
He's right.

26:36.873 --> 26:38.393
Gotcha.

26:53.273 --> 26:56.632
Police! Move! Out of the way!

26:56.633 --> 26:58.873
Come on, clear off!

27:27.033 --> 27:29.192
Rich?! Rich?!

27:32.233 --> 27:33.673
Rich?!

27:35.233 --> 27:36.673
Rich?!

27:38.233 --> 27:40.713
Rich?! Rich?!

27:42.913 --> 27:44.433
- Argh!
- Alright?

27:46.473 --> 27:48.833
It's alright. It's alright.

27:49.993 --> 27:52.872
Come on Rich. Help me.

27:52.873 --> 27:54.472
Help me, come on.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.753
That's it. That's it.

27:57.473 --> 27:59.193
That's it. That's it.

28:04.993 --> 28:05.993
Would you mind?

28:09.393 --> 28:11.639
Oh well, I hope that wasn't my masseur.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.873
He gets hopelessly booked up.

28:42.673 --> 28:44.232
She's been processed.

28:44.233 --> 28:47.152
We should call Harry, let him
know we've got her.

28:47.153 --> 28:49.193
I want to speak to her first.

29:11.433 --> 29:13.873
Why did you kill DSI Alistair Winter?

29:15.248 --> 29:19.485
Shouldn't this be taking place in an
interview room, with a lawyer?

29:19.510 --> 29:20.233
Maybe!

29:20.234 --> 29:24.313
You killed a cop. Things get done
differently because of that.

29:27.193 --> 29:30.166
Why did you kill Alistair?

29:39.153 --> 29:42.842
You are in a cell, in a police station.

29:43.393 --> 29:46.072
There are at least twenty people
outside willing to beat the

29:46.073 --> 29:47.739
shit out of you!

29:48.393 --> 29:50.073
You will go down for this.

29:50.434 --> 29:52.032
I will make sure that you pay.

29:52.033 --> 29:58.272
My darling, if I am punished, the
only one who will see it is

29:58.273 --> 29:59.233
Harry Clayton.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.770
Harry thought that he was the only
one that could catch you?

30:07.473 --> 30:09.282
What's the deal with the bracelets?

30:10.753 --> 30:16.171
How do you think Harry gets all
these breaks? On his cases.

30:16.913 --> 30:21.392
You know the near death escapes,
the extraordinary coincidences,

30:21.393 --> 30:23.633
they all seem to work in his favour.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.912
I know you might not buy into this but

30:28.913 --> 30:31.713
these are lucky bracelets.

30:33.753 --> 30:34.753
Very powerful.

30:42.113 --> 30:43.873
Should be good to get away.

30:44.296 --> 30:45.793
Get some fresh air,

30:46.639 --> 30:48.433
some Auntie Niamh's cooking.

30:49.953 --> 30:51.750
I'm sorry, Rich.

30:53.793 --> 30:55.846
That was some luck,
finding me like that.

30:57.045 --> 30:58.433
You saved my life.

31:01.953 --> 31:02.993
Just shows you.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.295
Shows me what?

31:06.673 --> 31:08.385
Your always saying she's too strong.

31:10.576 --> 31:12.197
I don't think so!

31:17.193 --> 31:18.487
So.

31:20.153 --> 31:21.464
Is that forever?

31:23.873 --> 31:25.472
Bet it's not.

31:25.473 --> 31:26.486
No chance.

31:27.793 --> 31:29.164
Can't be.

31:31.233 --> 31:32.680
Look erm...

31:38.004 --> 31:39.683
Make me proud.

31:59.313 --> 32:02.992
My toilet, if that's what you
call it, is all blocked up.

32:02.993 --> 32:04.353
Can I use another one?

32:20.913 --> 32:24.033
Don't even think about trying
to close the door.

32:43.553 --> 32:44.912
I want my solicitor.

32:44.913 --> 32:45.995
How's your nose?

32:47.788 --> 32:49.589
We've got Isabella.

32:50.553 --> 32:53.192
Your boss isn't quite so
magical after all, is she?

32:53.193 --> 32:54.512
And Harry Clayton?

32:54.513 --> 32:58.266
Oh he found his brother.
So that plan didn't work either.

32:58.953 --> 33:00.512
Harry's not here, is he?

33:00.513 --> 33:02.486
Why does that matter?

33:03.913 --> 33:08.974
And where is the girl,
DS Chohan? She is here, yes?

33:10.193 --> 33:13.659
Alright, enough!
What are you talking about?

33:13.660 --> 33:16.353
Why do you care if Suri's
here, and Harry isn't?

33:16.798 --> 33:18.712
Don't you see?

33:18.713 --> 33:21.433
He has to lose everything.

33:27.285 --> 33:28.091
Suri.

33:28.092 --> 33:30.392
Harry. We've got her.

33:30.393 --> 33:33.032
What? No you can't have... where is she?

33:33.033 --> 33:35.112
Don't worry she's in the cells.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.832
The only reason you've got her
is because she let you.

33:37.833 --> 33:39.872
- What do you mean?
- She's too powerful for you.

33:39.873 --> 33:41.672
That's what she said!

33:41.673 --> 33:44.512
Harry, has this got something
to do with the bracelet?

33:44.513 --> 33:45.832
Suri. Get out of there. Now!

33:45.833 --> 33:47.472
This is all sounding a bit crazy!

33:47.473 --> 33:48.433
Yeah. I know. I know.

33:48.434 --> 33:50.643
I'll explain later, just listen to
me. get out of there, now!

34:06.033 --> 34:08.033
Everybody out!

34:31.337 --> 34:32.976
The ambulances are here!

34:39.016 --> 34:41.377
Here, Give me! Give me!

34:50.137 --> 34:51.337
Suri?

34:52.177 --> 34:53.617
Hello, Suri?

34:54.777 --> 34:56.137
Suri?

34:59.857 --> 35:01.297
Harry?

35:03.017 --> 35:06.096
- Steve? Steve?
- I can't find her, Harry.

35:06.097 --> 35:08.216
She's here. She's got to be here.

35:08.217 --> 35:09.697
She called me from here, Suri!

35:11.257 --> 35:12.683
Suri?

35:13.377 --> 35:15.617
Andy? Andy?

35:17.777 --> 35:19.017
Polly?

35:19.297 --> 35:22.716
Oh God, SURI!

35:28.617 --> 35:30.057
HARRY!

35:37.777 --> 35:39.656
Suri!

35:39.657 --> 35:41.766
Someone help please!

36:09.577 --> 36:11.497
- Well?
- Harry, come on let's go.

36:12.937 --> 36:16.376
Harry! Hey! Come on!

36:16.377 --> 36:18.449
Listen, she's been
calling for you, Harry.

36:19.857 --> 36:21.257
Harry!

36:23.897 --> 36:25.577
Get her!

36:26.577 --> 36:28.617
You can do this...

37:30.777 --> 37:32.777
I'm waiting...

38:50.297 --> 38:52.416
I knew you'd come.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.526
Of course I came.

38:57.417 --> 39:00.017
I was trying to run away from all of
this,

39:00.417 --> 39:01.576
I just boarded a flight

39:01.577 --> 39:04.736
and then a strange mechanical
fault grounded the plane.

39:04.737 --> 39:07.097
And I ended up in that hotel.

39:07.817 --> 39:09.497
This is all for us!

39:11.417 --> 39:13.697
The bracelets wanted us to be
together, Harry.

39:15.497 --> 39:17.457
You should be dead!

39:18.337 --> 39:19.822
But you're not.

39:24.937 --> 39:26.497
It's our fate.

39:27.097 --> 39:29.017
I don't believe in fate.

39:32.777 --> 39:34.337
This is for Alistair...

39:34.977 --> 39:37.217
For the brother I've abandoned,

39:37.337 --> 39:39.057
the wife I've lost.

39:39.817 --> 39:41.297
Can you really do this?

39:42.417 --> 39:45.057
The daughter I'll never see again.

40:27.177 --> 40:28.657
Not this time.

40:31.177 --> 40:33.337
Your luck is running out.

40:46.737 --> 40:49.017
There's nowhere to run, Isabella!

41:32.217 --> 41:34.097
The bracelet won't allow it.

41:35.777 --> 41:37.480
Shall we see?

41:38.577 --> 41:40.297
You'd have to wish me dead.

41:42.817 --> 41:43.857
That isn't you.

41:44.743 --> 41:46.177
You don't think like that.

41:48.737 --> 41:50.297
You're too good.

42:00.177 --> 42:01.937
I wish I'd met you before.

42:04.097 --> 42:06.177
Seen you with your daughters.

42:08.217 --> 42:09.570
Don't...

42:10.337 --> 42:11.897
You were a good person,

42:12.537 --> 42:13.897
a good mother.

42:16.977 --> 42:18.617
I was.

42:20.977 --> 42:23.377
And then the bracelet got hold of you.

42:26.977 --> 42:28.457
I...

42:29.297 --> 42:32.497
It wasn't just the bracelet,

42:34.457 --> 42:36.297
it, it was me too...

42:37.817 --> 42:41.136
God I was blinded by its power,

42:41.137 --> 42:42.737
it seduced me,

42:43.880 --> 42:47.897
it made me greedy,

42:48.897 --> 42:50.697
and so then...

42:52.217 --> 42:54.137
my girls,

42:57.497 --> 42:59.377
they died because of me...

43:03.897 --> 43:05.217
But you're strong.

43:07.177 --> 43:09.377
Though it will happen to you in time.

43:13.297 --> 43:17.377
It's the inevitable corrosive power
of the bracelet.

43:17.977 --> 43:19.417
Harry.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.856
If you pull that trigger...

43:24.857 --> 43:25.857
I have to.

43:27.177 --> 43:28.657
There's no other way.

43:32.217 --> 43:33.748
Maybe there is.

43:38.657 --> 43:40.457
This is my final gift to you.

43:43.497 --> 43:44.777
I love you.
