00:21.189 --> 00:23.400
Mmm.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.613
Mmm.

00:28.780 --> 00:31.366
Have a good time.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.284
But not too good.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.495
I don't even want to go.

00:35.662 --> 00:37.580
The guys insisted.

00:37.747 --> 00:41.209
It's just gonna be
a lot of drinking, poker,

00:41.376 --> 00:43.044
guys lighting their farts
on fire...

00:43.211 --> 00:46.840
And that chick at
the Saddlestrap in Finleyville

00:47.006 --> 00:49.551
who can shoot ping-pong balls
out of her cooch.

00:49.718 --> 00:52.637
Strippers are fine,
but no hookers.

00:52.804 --> 00:55.682
I don't want you bringing bugs
back into our bed.

00:59.310 --> 01:02.647
Everything I want...
is right here.

01:17.954 --> 01:20.415
Hey, make sure
that Peter has a good time.

01:20.582 --> 01:22.667
He needs it.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.544
Done.

01:26.171 --> 01:28.631
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.554
Bring a toothbrush.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.751
With Spivak's genome sequencing
now complete, comma,

03:28.918 --> 03:31.671
markers for a cartilaginous
skeletal structure

03:31.838 --> 03:36.050
and several cold water indices
can be isolated and identified.

03:37.218 --> 03:41.180
Dr Arnold Spivak, end quote.
Full stop.

03:43.141 --> 03:44.601
Histological preparation
and observation

03:44.767 --> 03:46.269
via standard microscopy

03:46.436 --> 03:49.022
reveals evenly distributed
structures resembling...

03:50.106 --> 03:52.442
..subcutaneous mucous glands,
comma,

03:52.609 --> 03:55.987
which further suggest amphibious
rather than reptilian genesis.

03:56.154 --> 03:57.614
Full stop.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.699
Far more troubling
is the evident

03:59.866 --> 04:02.619
phenotypic morpho-fluidity,
which allows the organism

04:02.785 --> 04:04.662
to assume the simulacra
of human form

04:04.829 --> 04:06.289
and consciousness
while maintain...

04:06.456 --> 04:07.957
<i>Attention, please.</i>

04:08.124 --> 04:10.209
<i>A biological contaminant
has been detected.</i>

04:10.376 --> 04:13.004
<i>Quarantine procedures
have been initiated.</i>

04:14.005 --> 04:15.882
Blinsky! Open the door!

04:16.048 --> 04:18.593
I can't. Contamination protocols
have been triggered.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.095
- There's no manual override.
- But I didn't do anything!

04:21.262 --> 04:24.766
- This must be some malfunction!
- Please, try to relax.

04:24.933 --> 04:27.185
The air sensor systems
are running their diagnostics.

04:27.352 --> 04:29.646
If there's been an error,
the system will auto-correct

04:29.812 --> 04:31.606
and the quarantine
will be lifted.

04:31.773 --> 04:33.066
When?

04:33.232 --> 04:36.194
Hard to say with any degree of
certainty, given the variables.

04:36.361 --> 04:40.114
Blinsky...bring me my meds
immediately.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.616
What?

04:41.783 --> 04:44.744
Bring me my meds!

04:46.037 --> 04:48.122
Of course I'd be happy to,
but unfortunately

04:48.289 --> 04:49.916
the containment module
is not equipped

04:50.083 --> 04:51.501
with a pass-through apparatus.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.049
I talked to the guys

04:58.216 --> 05:00.301
about boosting
the drugs and shit,

05:00.468 --> 05:04.722
and I gotta say, they just
don't think it's a problem.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.933
What happened to
the fucking ice-cream trucks?

05:07.100 --> 05:08.643
Yeah, I'm still doing that too.

05:09.894 --> 05:12.605
Come on, man,
how about a little rhythm here?

05:12.772 --> 05:15.358
Everything I do is for Destiny,
you know that.

05:15.525 --> 05:18.069
Oh, and this is how you plan
to take care of her,

05:18.236 --> 05:19.570
by getting your ass shot off?

05:19.737 --> 05:21.030
Be sure to get her knocked up

05:21.197 --> 05:22.532
so your kids never know
their father.

05:22.699 --> 05:25.201
That's what's gonna happen when
your shit plan goes sideways.

05:26.995 --> 05:29.497
OK, look, maybe you're right.

05:29.664 --> 05:32.792
Maybe the whole heist thing
needs rethinking.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.670
You think MAYBE the heist thing
needs rethinking?

05:35.837 --> 05:37.880
That's what I said.

05:40.842 --> 05:42.719
What the fuck
do you want from me?

05:42.885 --> 05:45.596
I want you to show me
that you can be trusted.

05:56.107 --> 05:57.859
Where is everybody?

05:59.110 --> 06:01.571
Hello? Anybody here?

06:03.781 --> 06:05.241
Shit.

06:07.243 --> 06:08.953
Fuck.

07:35.957 --> 07:37.959
Oh, my God.

07:42.213 --> 07:44.090
Oh, my God.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.980
Andreas, Peter,
where are you?

08:08.990 --> 08:10.908
My fucking head.
I need some air.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.840
You OK?

08:27.675 --> 08:29.552
What I told you last night
about Letha...

08:29.719 --> 08:31.637
You can't put that on yourself.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.933
I kept my daughter
locked in a soundproof box,

08:37.101 --> 08:38.811
and I never knew
how to love her.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.438
That is on me.

08:45.985 --> 08:47.945
Promise me
you won't tell anybody.

08:48.112 --> 08:48.946
OK.

08:49.113 --> 08:51.908
Especially Peter.
He would never understand.

08:52.074 --> 08:56.120
I'm very good
at keeping secrets.

08:56.287 --> 08:57.747
These things last night, I...

08:57.914 --> 08:59.749
Why do you think
they were after us?

09:01.292 --> 09:02.793
I don't know.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.670
Maybe it's our turn.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.759
I'm OK now. I can drive.

09:09.926 --> 09:12.303
- You're not even close to fine.
- I'm fine.

09:12.470 --> 09:15.431
And you need blood. We both do.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.777
So maybe you and I
should hunt after all.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.741
I got a better idea.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.577
Let's rob a bank.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.460
<i>Dr Pryce's line.
Dr Blinsky speaking.</i>

09:44.627 --> 09:45.503
Where is he?

09:45.670 --> 09:48.464
<i>I'm sorry, Ms Godfrey, Dr Pryce
is indisposed at the moment.</i>

09:48.631 --> 09:50.424
Fuck that.
Tell him to wipe his ass.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.677
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.400
Oh, my God.

10:53.738 --> 10:56.324
- Morning.
- 'Tis.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.702
People get up
kind of early around here.

10:59.869 --> 11:03.289
Yeah, there's not much to do
after sundown.

11:03.456 --> 11:06.876
Gets pretty cold. And dark.

11:08.586 --> 11:10.087
What you got there?

11:14.175 --> 11:16.218
Emily Dickinson, huh?

11:16.385 --> 11:18.179
I love her stuff.

11:18.346 --> 11:21.557
There was a long time...
maybe my whole life, really,

11:21.724 --> 11:24.268
when it felt like
she was my only friend.

11:24.435 --> 11:27.063
Probably sounds silly.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.898
No, not at all.

11:30.358 --> 11:32.610
""Hope' is the thing
with feathers

11:32.777 --> 11:35.154
"That perches in the soul,

11:35.321 --> 11:38.324
"And sings the tunes
without the words...

11:39.617 --> 11:42.161
"And never stops at all..."

11:46.165 --> 11:47.666
What are you doing?

11:49.001 --> 11:50.795
Wait and see.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.106
Mind if I try?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.402
Do your thing.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.788
Thanks.

13:00.448 --> 13:01.782
Yes?

13:01.949 --> 13:05.578
What kind of fucked-up shit
did you do in your last life

13:05.744 --> 13:09.165
to get punished
with a mug like that?

13:10.166 --> 13:15.129
Shit, and I thought
I'd seen ugly in my day.

13:15.296 --> 13:17.047
Saw a lady once

13:17.214 --> 13:20.384
who had her whole face
cut off by a lawn mower,

13:20.551 --> 13:22.428
looked better than you.

13:22.595 --> 13:26.974
I don't give two shits
what that judge said.

13:27.141 --> 13:31.187
Admit it.
You got away with murder.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.397
Didn't you?

13:35.191 --> 13:36.192
Huh?

13:36.358 --> 13:38.152
Yep.

13:38.319 --> 13:40.488
And you know why?

13:41.489 --> 13:43.699
Because I enjoy killing.

13:43.866 --> 13:47.661
Dogs, cats, people.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.247
Kill, kill, kill.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.750
It's a calling, really.

13:52.917 --> 13:57.171
So you better keep that in mind
when you go to sleep tonight.

13:57.338 --> 14:00.591
'Cause this doesn't close.

14:00.758 --> 14:03.385
And I'll be watching you.

14:41.131 --> 14:45.636
Welcome to the Rooster Poot
Playhouse!

15:00.025 --> 15:01.860
They figured out
the caviar was stepped on.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.071
- That's gotta be what this is about.
- Impossible.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.323
- I handled it. You saw.
- Croats are fucking crazy.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.367
I don't give a fuck
what the reason was.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.578
We got to hit back,
and twice as hard.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.289
Take it easy.
I know it's hard, but just...

15:13.455 --> 15:15.082
Did they deserve this? Huh?

15:15.249 --> 15:17.710
You all knew these folks.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.671
- Shandor, the rest of them.
- I say we fuck 'em up.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.257
Turn the snow red with their
blood. Rat-shit cowards.

15:23.424 --> 15:25.884
Hey, the Croats aren't the only
ones we've grifted, alright?

15:26.051 --> 15:28.262
For all we know, this could've
been somebody else altogether.

15:28.429 --> 15:30.306
Could've been the guys we jacked
the stuff from originally.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.725
Either way, we're not
going to war with anyone.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.441
You calling the shots now,
Peter?

15:42.901 --> 15:44.737
We gotta take care
of them first.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.281
I say we walk the fuck away
like we were never here.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.242
No. We leave them here, the cops
will be up our asses so fast.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.661
I say we pull the backhoe
around, dig a hole.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.663
A few Gypsies vanish,
who's gonna give a damn?

15:54.830 --> 15:57.499
They're family! Not some
fucking trash to be thrown out.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.336
Come here.

16:04.173 --> 16:05.466
Fucking animals.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.009
- Andreas, you gotta calm down.
- But these...

16:07.176 --> 16:09.470
Get the guys to put the bodies
on a truck,

16:09.637 --> 16:12.222
appoint someone to drive it
to a long-term lot somewhere,

16:12.389 --> 16:13.682
lock it up,
let the bodies freeze,

16:13.849 --> 16:16.685
and that buys us some time to
figure out what to do with them.

16:16.852 --> 16:18.979
Everyone else scrubs every inch
of this place with bleach.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.939
Walls, floors, everywhere.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.399
And when they're done

16:22.566 --> 16:24.193
and there's not a drop
of blood left,

16:24.360 --> 16:26.070
they're gonna start scrubbing
some more, understand?

16:27.738 --> 16:29.365
Do you understand?

16:33.619 --> 16:36.038
OK. Give me your car keys.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.915
Why? Where are you going?

16:38.082 --> 16:40.501
I'm gonna find out who did this.

16:40.668 --> 16:42.461
Just...just...

16:43.462 --> 16:44.880
..clean up this mess

16:45.047 --> 16:47.633
and don't do anything else
until I get back.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.677
OK?

16:51.804 --> 16:53.305
Keys.

17:25.713 --> 17:27.589
Hey, babe.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.383
Hey, creamsicle.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.468
So, what's up?

17:31.635 --> 17:33.262
Did you get there OK?

17:33.429 --> 17:36.432
Yeah. Yeah, I was just
checking in like I said I would.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.851
Is everything OK?

17:39.017 --> 17:43.355
All good. I just called to say
I love you and, uh, I miss you.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.357
Me too.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.402
Did you like your big surprise?

17:48.569 --> 17:50.237
Uh...what?

17:50.404 --> 17:52.489
Don't tell me some asshole
broke into the car

17:52.656 --> 17:53.991
and stole it last night.

17:54.158 --> 17:56.744
The watch.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.330
Sorry, yeah. God, it's...
it's beautiful, baby.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.458
- I love it.
- Good.

18:05.294 --> 18:06.962
OK, well...

18:08.005 --> 18:10.716
..say hi to the boys for me.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.050
I will.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.719
Just, er...

18:14.762 --> 18:16.597
..be careful, OK?

18:19.892 --> 18:21.727
What do you mean?

18:21.894 --> 18:24.354
Nothing. Just, you know,
your men are out of town.

18:24.521 --> 18:27.399
Since when do I need you
and Peter to take care of me?

18:30.027 --> 18:31.653
Since never.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.990
Just...just take care.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.867
Sure.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.829
I love you so much.

18:40.996 --> 18:43.290
I love you too, babe.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.975
Ugh.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.261
No, no, no! Don't shoot!

21:47.140 --> 21:49.101
Please, just let us go!

22:01.279 --> 22:04.282
Stop! Roman, enough.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.493
Let's just get out of here.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.662
Ugh!

22:23.885 --> 22:27.848
From Zion, perfect in beauty...

22:29.391 --> 22:32.728
..from the rising of the sun
to where it sets,

22:32.894 --> 22:34.855
God shines forth.

22:35.856 --> 22:37.607
A fire devours before him.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.533
He was gonna kill you.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.828
He'd be alive,
if we weren't who we are,

22:49.995 --> 22:51.747
what we are.

22:54.041 --> 22:57.627
Greedy, barbarous and cruel.

23:10.891 --> 23:14.227
My people are dead, and you're
out buying groceries. Why?

23:14.394 --> 23:17.230
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:17.397 --> 23:21.068
I swear to God, if you lie,
I'll take your eye.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.529
How much did they pay you
to rat us out?

23:24.696 --> 23:25.989
The Croats
are moving their product

23:26.156 --> 23:27.574
to their retailers
on the street.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.409
If they found out
it had been stepped on,

23:29.576 --> 23:30.869
they'd have trashed the load.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.288
I'd be hanging by a bridge
with a hook through my tongue.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.207
I want to know
who's responsible.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.042
You tell me your people
have been killed.

23:37.209 --> 23:39.419
Do you think I'm consulted
about such things?

23:39.586 --> 23:41.755
All I know is fish eggs.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.683
You're going to make some calls,

23:53.850 --> 23:55.602
put me in a room
with who's in charge.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.646
- I want a meeting.
- But I'm nobody.

23:57.813 --> 23:59.773
- I have no authority.
- Do it.

24:22.712 --> 24:25.882
You sure you wouldn't prefer
spending the night at my place?

24:26.049 --> 24:28.635
I think I need to be alone.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.848
When will I see you again?

24:57.956 --> 25:00.417
Ms Godfrey, it would be best
for all concerned

25:00.584 --> 25:02.002
if you would just take a minute

25:02.169 --> 25:03.837
and listen
to what I have to say.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.923
Would you mind telling me
what, exactly, is going on here?

25:07.090 --> 25:08.383
Dr Pryce
is in containment.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.261
Well, I can see that, Blinsky.
I'd like to know why.

25:11.428 --> 25:14.264
Well, that is a matter
of some conjecture...

25:14.431 --> 25:16.099
Olivia!

25:16.266 --> 25:18.643
Get that little maggot
to open this door!

25:23.356 --> 25:25.442
How long does he need
to stay in there like that?

25:25.609 --> 25:27.319
Well, that's another
known unknown.

25:27.485 --> 25:29.821
I fucking hate boxes!

25:29.988 --> 25:32.532
Speaking of boxes,
what's up with those rats?

25:32.699 --> 25:34.034
What rats?

25:34.201 --> 25:36.244
The ones on your computer
devouring each other.

25:36.411 --> 25:37.871
You hacked into my computer?

25:38.038 --> 25:41.041
I want you to explain why you're
watching cannibal rat porn

25:41.208 --> 25:42.709
and what it has to do with me.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.378
- How did you...
- It doesn't matter! Explain!

25:45.545 --> 25:48.256
I work with lab rats all the
time. That's what they're for.

25:48.423 --> 25:49.966
You didn't answer the question.

25:52.010 --> 25:55.847
This might come as a shock,
but not everything in this lab

25:56.014 --> 25:59.226
or elsewhere on the planet
is about you, Olivia!

26:00.727 --> 26:02.687
Are you hiding Shelley
in the White Tower somewhere?

26:02.854 --> 26:05.607
- Because if you are...
- You lost Shelley?!

26:05.774 --> 26:07.817
- No, I didn't lose Shelley!
- Goddamn it!

26:07.984 --> 26:09.277
- You know what...
- I knew it!

26:09.444 --> 26:11.279
- What did you do with her?
- I'm sick and tired...

26:11.446 --> 26:13.990
- The second you got her...
- I'm telling you, shut up!

26:17.369 --> 26:20.956
Give it to me straight.
Is my cancer back?

26:28.630 --> 26:30.674
Maybe.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.342
And maybe not.

26:32.509 --> 26:35.971
You open this door
and you let me take my meds,

26:36.137 --> 26:38.515
and then I will tell you
everything I know.

26:39.891 --> 26:41.518
Open the door, get him his meds.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.186
I can't.

26:43.353 --> 26:45.897
There's no manual override,
as Dr Pryce well knows.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.941
- He says you can't open it.
- Don't listen to him.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.234
He's lying!

26:51.987 --> 26:53.446
No.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.742
I suppose there's
no delicate way to say this.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.244
Dr Pryce is going through

26:59.411 --> 27:01.121
the classic stages
of drug withdrawal.

27:02.622 --> 27:05.667
I had no idea how bad
his addiction had become.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.002
People rarely do.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.045
We should consider this
unexpected development a gift,

27:09.212 --> 27:11.298
a kind of cosmic intervention,
if you will.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.550
Soon the drug will have released
its insidious hold

27:13.717 --> 27:15.885
and recovery can begin.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.597
Did you trap him
in there on purpose?

27:19.764 --> 27:21.099
What?

27:21.266 --> 27:24.269
How...how can you even
suggest such a thing?

27:24.436 --> 27:27.314
You did. You stuck him
in there to get clean.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.024
I did no such thing.

27:29.190 --> 27:32.360
A masterstroke.
Deeply compassionate.

27:33.987 --> 27:37.032
I've been very worried
about him. The self-abuse.

27:37.198 --> 27:39.242
It takes
a truly extraordinary man

27:39.409 --> 27:41.077
to shoulder a burden like that,

27:41.244 --> 27:43.246
restoring that
once brilliant mind to sanity,

27:43.413 --> 27:44.831
no matter the consequences

27:44.998 --> 27:47.167
to your own career
or reputation.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.545
Dr Pryce can't do this alone.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.381
He's going to need
all the help he can get.

27:53.548 --> 27:57.719
So I guess it'll be up to us
to love him through this.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.514
Yes, it will indeed.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.559
Now, he should be through
the worst of it

28:04.726 --> 28:07.062
in...another 24 hours.

28:08.813 --> 28:11.066
So to be clear,
there's no contamination?

28:11.232 --> 28:14.069
Only the poison
he's got himself hooked on.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.945
Open the door. Now.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.614
But you just said...

28:17.781 --> 28:20.450
Do what I say and this
little ruse stays between us.

28:20.617 --> 28:23.495
Otherwise, you can kiss
your career goodbye.

28:27.082 --> 28:27.916
Hello?

28:28.083 --> 28:30.001
Olivia, you're gonna
want to get down here.

28:30.168 --> 28:31.461
Shelley's at your apartment.

28:31.628 --> 28:35.340
- My apartment?
- She's with some dude.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.634
- What dude?
- I have no idea.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.719
They don't look like
they're sticking around,

28:39.886 --> 28:42.222
so you're gonna want to
put a little fire under it.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.603
Look, I have an errand to run.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.022
You keep him in there
until I get back

28:51.189 --> 28:52.899
or I'll have your ass on a spit.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.360
- Are we clear?
- Yes, I think so.

28:55.527 --> 28:57.904
- No! Are we clear?
- Yes.

29:41.239 --> 29:43.658
Fuck.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.967
This is where it starts.
And this is where it ends.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.760
What's that supposed to mean?

30:14.564 --> 30:15.899
<i>Brianna is the picture</i>

30:16.065 --> 30:17.692
<i>of wedding-day perfection.</i>

30:17.859 --> 30:19.486
<i>In just four short weeks</i>

30:19.652 --> 30:22.071
<i>and a little more
than 7,000 over budget,</i>

30:22.238 --> 30:24.699
<i>Julius made Brianna's
wedding wash-out</i>

30:24.866 --> 30:26.910
<i>into a wedding wonderland.</i>

30:27.076 --> 30:29.829
<i>Everything about it
was just totally magical.</i>

30:29.996 --> 30:31.456
<i>Julius was so caring
and understanding...</i>

30:31.623 --> 30:32.457
'Bye.

30:32.624 --> 30:35.502
<i>This fully mature male
Grant's gazelle senses danger.</i>

30:35.668 --> 30:37.587
<i>- But too late.</i>
- Mmm.

30:37.754 --> 30:39.422
<i>The leopard
is already in motion,</i>

30:39.589 --> 30:41.508
<i>taking down its prey
as the rest...</i>

30:41.674 --> 30:43.426
<i>..of the herd scatters.</i>

30:43.593 --> 30:45.637
Who is it?

30:57.690 --> 30:58.983
Surprise!

31:00.777 --> 31:02.946
Hey. Hi.

31:03.112 --> 31:05.281
Hi!

31:05.448 --> 31:06.699
Hey!

31:06.866 --> 31:08.868
Alright.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.087
What are the streets
telling you, cousin?

31:27.554 --> 31:29.347
It was the Croats.

31:30.515 --> 31:35.520
Well, while you were out there
confirming the obvious,

31:35.687 --> 31:37.897
me and the pack came up
with a plan.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.525
They're all going to be at their
shithole social club tonight.

31:40.692 --> 31:44.153
We're going to chain
the doors shut from the outside

31:44.320 --> 31:45.905
and torch the place,

31:46.072 --> 31:48.241
with everyone inside.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.368
- Cremate them all.
- Yeah.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.745
Everyone, huh?

31:55.665 --> 31:56.749
Women too?

31:56.916 --> 31:59.419
Let every corpse be a lesson.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.171
Shock and awe, brother.

32:02.338 --> 32:06.009
Shock and motherfucking awe!

32:12.974 --> 32:14.309
OK.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.562
We hit back.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.480
But we hit back smart.

32:20.481 --> 32:22.150
Surgically.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.277
We're gonna take one head.

32:25.278 --> 32:26.487
Milan's.

32:26.654 --> 32:29.198
We have to take the same number
of lives they took from us.

32:29.365 --> 32:30.825
That's the law.
It's gotta be that way.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.870
No! Just Milan's.

32:34.037 --> 32:36.164
When we wave
that prick's head around,

32:36.331 --> 32:38.583
he becomes the symbol for
the bloodbath that he caused.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.002
That way, they got no more skin
left in the game.

32:41.169 --> 32:43.588
Everyone goes home
and moves on with their lives.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.466
Yes?

32:50.762 --> 32:53.640
So you just watched them
drive away and you did nothing?

32:53.806 --> 32:55.183
There were two of them,

32:55.350 --> 32:56.768
and your daughter
is seven feet tall.

32:56.934 --> 32:59.312
I felt a physical confrontation
would have been asymmetrical.

32:59.479 --> 33:00.855
Then why didn't you follow them?

33:01.022 --> 33:02.315
I am following them.

33:02.482 --> 33:04.317
I slapped a GPS tracker
on the guy's truck,

33:04.484 --> 33:06.152
and my guy at the DMV's
running plates.

33:06.319 --> 33:07.820
They won't get far.

33:18.373 --> 33:21.000
She's taken up
with a common thief.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.044
An addict, probably.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.047
She'll be completely
under his control.

33:26.214 --> 33:27.715
I know junkies, Olivia.

33:27.882 --> 33:31.177
This guy didn't fit the bill.
Not by a long shot.

33:31.344 --> 33:33.721
Well, maybe...
maybe he's kidnapping her,

33:33.888 --> 33:37.141
selling her to God knows who
for God knows what.

33:37.308 --> 33:39.769
I didn't get that vibe.
She seemed pretty happy.

33:39.936 --> 33:41.854
Because he's got her
doped out of her mind

33:42.021 --> 33:43.773
on all sorts of drugs.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.986
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Nobody's doing anything to you.

33:49.153 --> 33:52.240
It looked like she was
having fun. You remember fun.

33:52.407 --> 33:55.785
Stealing her mother blind?
You call that fun?

33:57.036 --> 34:00.123
My daughter doesn't know
the first thing about...

34:01.124 --> 34:02.917
..anything.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.920
She doesn't have the sense
God gave little chickens.

34:11.717 --> 34:16.013
She's not...planning
on coming back, is she?

34:18.558 --> 34:20.768
I was never there for her.

34:38.119 --> 34:42.165
Hi. I was wondering
if I might...

34:42.331 --> 34:43.623
Whatever you're selling -

34:43.791 --> 34:46.835
magazines, carrot seeds, Jesus,
I am not interested.

34:47.003 --> 34:48.504
I'm not selling anything.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.215
If I could come in,
I'll explain.

34:51.382 --> 34:54.635
I don't let total strangers
into my house.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.554
Please...

35:04.520 --> 35:06.314
I'm not feeling well,

35:06.481 --> 35:10.985
not that it's any of
your concern, so just...

35:17.825 --> 35:20.661
Remove your fucking hand
from my door.

35:20.828 --> 35:22.663
I'm your daughter.

35:22.830 --> 35:25.625
You're insane.

35:25.792 --> 35:29.086
Sunt fata ta Magdalena.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.590
Who put you up to this?

35:32.757 --> 35:36.010
My father said he never
stopped loving you.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.847
He said you were the most
beautiful woman he'd ever met.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.768
- His name was Dimitri.
- He lied.

35:43.935 --> 35:46.729
Whoever told you that
was a liar.

35:46.896 --> 35:48.648
They all are.

35:48.815 --> 35:50.942
They tell you something pretty,
whatever you need to hear,

35:51.108 --> 35:52.819
but they always leave.

35:52.985 --> 35:55.154
I don't want anything from you,

35:55.321 --> 35:58.366
except to understand
why you gave me up.

35:58.533 --> 36:00.159
It couldn't have been easy.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.744
I heard the stories.

36:01.911 --> 36:04.497
You were practically
a child yourself.

36:05.498 --> 36:07.834
I didn't come
to make your life harder.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.294
But I have to know.

36:14.048 --> 36:15.842
This is where I'm staying.

36:16.008 --> 36:18.219
Come find me when you're ready.

36:32.275 --> 36:35.403
This town is just full
of crazy people.

37:09.645 --> 37:13.107
Yeah.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.325
- That was amazing.
- Your turn.

37:22.491 --> 37:25.328
My turn? To do what?

37:25.494 --> 37:26.996
Whatever you want.

37:27.163 --> 37:30.416
That stage is a window
into your soul.

37:31.751 --> 37:34.587
I can't go up there.
The whole idea terrifies me.

37:35.796 --> 37:38.466
Well, then that's exactly
the reason to do it.

37:38.633 --> 37:41.177
Run at that barking dog.

37:41.344 --> 37:42.970
Make your fears your ally.

37:44.722 --> 37:46.515
I wouldn't even know what to do.

37:46.682 --> 37:50.144
Doesn't matter what you do.
Only that you do.

37:50.311 --> 37:53.314
And you have my solemn word,

37:53.481 --> 37:56.025
this is not going on
your permanent record.

37:57.401 --> 37:58.694
I can't.

37:58.861 --> 38:00.571
I don't even...

38:00.738 --> 38:02.657
Some Emily.

38:04.158 --> 38:06.786
What would the Belle of Amherst
think if she knew

38:06.953 --> 38:10.831
you were denying the gift
of her poetry, her heart,

38:10.998 --> 38:13.292
to all these gentle folk?

38:16.879 --> 38:18.673
Do it for her.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.175
Speak her words out loud.

38:23.219 --> 38:26.806
You put it that way,
I'd be a total Eeyore to say no.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.309
You'll be fine.

38:56.961 --> 39:00.673
"I tried to think
a lonelier Thing

39:00.840 --> 39:03.843
"Than any I had seen

39:05.678 --> 39:08.014
"Some Polar Expiation

39:14.061 --> 39:19.650
"An Omen in the Bone
Of Death's tremendous nearness

39:21.318 --> 39:25.364
"I probed Retrieveless things

39:31.495 --> 39:34.957
"My Duplicate...to borrow..."

39:44.675 --> 39:46.135
Oh, yeah!

39:57.897 --> 40:01.317
<i>There is a deletion
referred to as V2...</i>

40:01.484 --> 40:04.653
..<i>they did not analyse
the presence or the absence...</i>

40:52.701 --> 40:55.496
Johann, please. Talk to me.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.627
Fuck you.

41:01.794 --> 41:04.088
You two have had it in for me
since the beginning.

41:04.255 --> 41:05.965
Johann, honestly...

41:06.132 --> 41:08.342
<i>The containment module
has been determined</i>

41:08.509 --> 41:10.052
<i>to be contamination-free.</i>

41:10.219 --> 41:12.054
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

41:12.221 --> 41:14.431
<i>The quarantine protocols
are terminated.</i>

41:14.598 --> 41:16.142
That was not
supposed to happen.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.977
He's not through it yet.

41:26.402 --> 41:28.320
Ugh.

41:28.487 --> 41:31.615
Mm.

41:45.462 --> 41:47.590
Doc...

41:47.756 --> 41:50.342
..the breaker on the
diagnostic sensors was tripped.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.136
Triggered a warning light
on the main panel.

41:52.303 --> 41:54.096
I reset it for ya.

42:02.980 --> 42:04.982
That is what's growing
inside of me?

42:05.149 --> 42:07.067
Yours will be a little smaller,
of course.

42:07.234 --> 42:09.361
I have your scans right here.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.363
And that is...

42:11.530 --> 42:13.616
Oh, that's the host body
it was withdrawn from.

42:16.702 --> 42:19.038
Oh, you have no idea
how much better I feel.

42:19.205 --> 42:22.374
Well, that's not gonna happen
to me. You're gonna fix it.

42:22.541 --> 42:26.086
I mean, you can just...
cut it out of me, tight?

42:26.253 --> 42:28.505
Unfortunately, the organism

42:28.672 --> 42:30.174
so entwines the brain
and spinal cord

42:30.341 --> 42:33.177
that extracting it would
almost always kill the patient.

42:33.344 --> 42:36.555
Well, then, chemo? Radiation?

42:36.722 --> 42:38.891
Anything's worth a try,
I suppose.

42:39.058 --> 42:42.228
Worst case, you'll just
whip up another creature

42:42.394 --> 42:43.729
like the one in the tank,

42:43.896 --> 42:45.564
and I'll just,
you know, feed on it,

42:45.731 --> 42:47.316
like I did with you-know-who.

42:47.483 --> 42:50.653
Growing another creature
would take 18 months minimum.

42:50.819 --> 42:52.821
You haven't got that long.

42:54.698 --> 42:56.617
What are you saying, Johann?

42:56.784 --> 42:58.869
Spivak created this disease.

42:59.036 --> 43:02.039
The rats were test subjects,
prototypes,

43:02.206 --> 43:03.540
engineered to manage
their disease

43:03.707 --> 43:05.376
by feeding on their own species.

43:06.919 --> 43:08.212
Well, does that work?

43:08.379 --> 43:10.297
Does it fix it
if I just feed on other...

43:10.464 --> 43:11.924
Regrettably, no -
from my experience,

43:12.091 --> 43:15.511
from my observation,
it just delays the inevitable.

43:15.678 --> 43:17.513
It's pretty much
a lose-lose situation.

43:19.890 --> 43:21.183
And you know this how?

43:21.350 --> 43:23.686
Spivak recorded his plans
in great detail

43:23.852 --> 43:25.229
using microdot technology,

43:25.396 --> 43:28.774
a quaint encryption trick
of the mid-20th century.

43:28.941 --> 43:30.943
They just made everything
really tiny

43:31.110 --> 43:33.904
and hoped nobody would find it.

43:34.071 --> 43:36.865
It's all there
in its original German.

43:37.032 --> 43:39.201
From its repeated references

43:39.368 --> 43:42.913
to "Die Welt wird frei
von Upirs sein."

43:43.080 --> 43:44.748
Um, "making the world
upir-free,"

43:44.915 --> 43:47.626
and, "Das Pathogen
zeigt keine Wirkung

43:47.793 --> 43:50.087
"an denen ihm
ausgesetzen Menschen."

43:50.254 --> 43:53.799
"The pathogen doesn't affect
human beings exposed to it."

43:53.966 --> 43:56.969
It's abundantly clear
that Spivak's development

43:57.136 --> 44:00.514
of the LoPS pathogen was and is
the primary catalyst

44:00.681 --> 44:03.225
for the extermination
of all upir.

44:07.229 --> 44:09.732
- Does Roman have it?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

44:09.898 --> 44:11.567
Of course he doesn't.

44:15.112 --> 44:17.072
How long before I...

44:18.073 --> 44:20.534
Well, I'd just be guessing,
but without treatment,

44:20.701 --> 44:22.911
I'd say a month, give or take.

44:23.078 --> 44:25.998
And, as I mentioned,
there currently is no treatment.

44:28.292 --> 44:30.002
Try not to stress.

44:31.170 --> 44:33.047
If there is a cure,
I'll find it.

44:48.354 --> 44:50.022
Remember, Pryce,

44:50.189 --> 44:52.733
if I die, my fail-safe plan

44:52.900 --> 44:56.528
to reveal your entire
sick, sordid past will kick in.

44:56.695 --> 44:59.823
You'll spend the rest
of your days a hunted man.

44:59.990 --> 45:02.326
So you'll be needing
your peppy pills

45:02.493 --> 45:05.371
to keep you
very fucking motivated.

45:33.190 --> 45:34.942
Dick...dick...

45:35.109 --> 45:36.527
These...

45:38.278 --> 45:39.696
..are...

45:41.448 --> 45:42.783
..for you.

45:44.785 --> 45:47.246
..'cause you're gonna
own Andreas's pretty soon.

45:47.413 --> 45:49.623
Ooh.

45:53.710 --> 45:56.213
Hey. Not to worry.

45:56.380 --> 45:58.507
It's gonna be great.

46:12.229 --> 46:14.523
Which one of you
is Destiny Rumancek?

46:26.452 --> 46:29.329
Oh, my God!
Yes, take it off!

46:45.721 --> 46:47.389
Oh, my God!

47:31.225 --> 47:32.768
Doesn't seem like
anybody's home.

47:32.935 --> 47:34.186
Shh.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.630
What the fuck is going on?

48:01.797 --> 48:05.217
Finally, our guests of honour.

48:11.807 --> 48:13.559
We were starting
to feel foolish,

48:13.725 --> 48:17.020
standing around in the dark,
but here you are.

48:19.648 --> 48:21.775
You like movies, Andreas?

48:22.943 --> 48:24.653
What kind?

48:24.820 --> 48:28.031
Comedies? Scary movies?

48:29.408 --> 48:30.951
Porn?

48:31.952 --> 48:34.037
Do you know
what kind of movies I like?

48:34.204 --> 48:35.497
I like comedies.

48:35.664 --> 48:38.500
I like porn,
but I like comedies more.

48:38.667 --> 48:39.876
Hmm.

48:42.838 --> 48:44.715
<i>You like that, don't you,</i>

48:44.881 --> 48:46.508
<i>you filthy bitch?</i>

48:46.675 --> 48:49.469
<i>Oh, fuck.
Yeah, baby, that's right.</i>

48:49.636 --> 48:51.054
<i>Say it. Say it.</i>

48:51.221 --> 48:53.557
<i>Say, "Fuck me
with that big, fat Gypsy cock."</i>

48:53.724 --> 48:55.100
<i>Say it.</i>

48:55.267 --> 48:58.478
<i>Fuck me with
that big, fat Gypsy cock.</i>

49:01.106 --> 49:02.649
<i>Mmm.</i>

49:02.816 --> 49:05.652
<i>Where do you want this
big, nasty load, baby?</i>

49:07.279 --> 49:08.905
<i>Anywhere you want
to shoot it,</i>

49:09.072 --> 49:12.117
<i>you hot fucking Gypsy bastard.</i>

49:13.452 --> 49:16.288
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

49:16.455 --> 49:18.832
<i>Just make sure
to erase this thing after.</i>

49:18.999 --> 49:20.626
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

49:20.792 --> 49:23.337
<i>I'm just gonna show it
to my friend, Tiff.</i>

49:23.503 --> 49:25.464
<i>Ohh. She gets off on this shit.</i>

49:31.595 --> 49:36.558
This piece of shit whore
is the daughter you raised, hmm?

49:39.186 --> 49:40.854
Are you proud, Momma,

49:41.021 --> 49:43.190
of the cum jug
you gave birth to?

49:45.359 --> 49:47.486
You put your family on a plane

49:47.653 --> 49:50.072
and you fly as far away
from here as you can.

49:50.238 --> 49:51.615
You understand?

49:53.033 --> 49:55.661
If I ever see
your faces again,

49:55.827 --> 50:00.374
I will cut you into pieces
and feed you to my dogs.

50:04.378 --> 50:06.505
Let's go.

50:13.261 --> 50:15.222
You got our people killed.

50:16.348 --> 50:19.601
And you were going to take more
innocent lives to cover up that?

50:26.191 --> 50:27.984
It ends here.

50:32.823 --> 50:34.324
I need your word.

50:35.325 --> 50:37.119
Come on. Wha...

50:37.285 --> 50:40.163
I let...I let pussy
cloud my judgement.

50:41.289 --> 50:43.375
Every man here
knows what it's like.

50:46.086 --> 50:48.547
I made a terrible mistake.

50:49.756 --> 50:51.258
I'm sorry.

50:56.555 --> 50:58.014
You have my word.

51:04.271 --> 51:06.523
Peter!
Peter, don't do this.

51:06.690 --> 51:08.316
Please, Peter.

51:11.153 --> 51:13.447
No more takedowns, I promise.

51:13.613 --> 51:15.532
OK, the pack's yours.
You're the boss.

51:15.699 --> 51:18.243
You thought you could
join our family?

51:18.410 --> 51:20.746
That I was going to
let you ruin my cousin's life?

51:20.912 --> 51:22.664
Ugh!

51:26.835 --> 51:28.712
Your cousin will hate you
forever.

51:30.672 --> 51:32.883
You fucking coward!

51:33.049 --> 51:36.011
Turning your own blood
over to these shitheads.

51:36.178 --> 51:39.848
You cocksucker!
Motherfucking cocksucker!

51:40.015 --> 51:44.978
Arggh! I'll see you in hell,
you filthy fucking faggot!
