HEY, NO SNATCHING

DIDN'T YOU?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.829
WE KNOW YOU DID IT.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.098
- WAS IT HEAVEN?
WAS IT BLISS?

08:18.131 --> 08:20.000
- PERMIT ME TO DO
THE CROSS-EXAMINING.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.602
WHO WAS TOP?
WHO WAS BOTTOM? HMM?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.003
- CHRIST, YOU SOUND LIKE ME.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.738

DID I MISS SOMETHING?

08:24.772 --> 08:25.873
YOU GUYS DIDN'T ACTUALLY...

08:25.906 --> 08:27.274
- ORDER IN THE COURT.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.610

08:39.720 --> 08:40.688
ALWAYS.
[chuckling]

08:40.721 --> 08:41.722

WE'VE ALWAYS CELEBRATE
THE DAY

08:51.999 --> 08:53.100
WE FIRST GOT TOGETHER.
ONE FOR YOU...

08:53.133 --> 08:54.768
- MY FRIENDS ARNIE
AND EDWARD,

08:54.802 --> 08:56.169
THEY CELEBRATE THE DAY
THEY FIRST FUCKED.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.639
- SAME THING.
- AND ONE FOR YOU...

08:58.672 --> 09:01.174
WE EXPECT YOU ALL
TO BE THERE.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.844
- WELL, DON'T EXPECT
ANY GIFTS THIS TIME.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.312
- EXCEPT...

09:05.345 --> 09:07.948
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS?

09:09.817 --> 09:10.918
- GUESS THEY WON'T
BE COMING.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.586
AT LEAST, NOT TOGETHER.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.921
- POOR SUNSHINE.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.756
HE REALLY LOVED HIM.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.090
- AND BRIAN
REALLY LOVED HIM.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.792
- YEAH, WELL,
HE SHOULD'VE SHOWED IT.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.327
- HE DID, IN HIS WAY.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.266
- POOR BRIAN
MUST BE SEQUESTERED AWAY,

09:26.299 --> 09:28.335
DEVASTATED, DISGRACED,

09:28.368 --> 09:31.739
BROKEN, HUMILIATED.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.808
[laughing]

09:34.842 --> 09:36.076
- OR MAYBE NOW HE'S,
YOU KNOW,

09:36.109 --> 09:37.911
PLANNING TO PACK HIS BAGS
AND MOVE ON,

09:37.945 --> 09:41.749
NOW THAT HE'S NO LONGER
PITTSBURGH'S NUMERO UNO HOMO.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.350
- WELL, REPORTS
OF MY DEATH HAVE BEEN

09:43.383 --> 09:45.819
GREATLY EXAGGERATED.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.821
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN THERE?

09:47.855 --> 09:49.122
[service bell dings]
- LONG ENOUGH...

09:49.156 --> 09:50.924
TO KNOW WHO
MY REAL FRIENDS ARE.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.661
- BRIAN...

09:53.694 --> 09:54.995
YOU OKAY?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.965
- I'M BRILLIANT, DAZZLING.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.867
[door closes]

10:13.146 --> 10:14.715
- YOU GONNA
JUST STAND THERE,

10:14.748 --> 10:16.216
OR YOU GONNA GET TO WORK?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.018
- [sighs]

10:28.696 --> 10:30.163
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:30.197 --> 10:31.732
- WELL, IT'S SUCH
A LOVELY DAY,

10:31.765 --> 10:32.866
I THOUGHT I'D GO
FOR A STROLL,

10:32.900 --> 10:34.134
YOU KNOW,
TAKE IN THE SIGHTS.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.770
- [grunts]
ME, THROWING OUT GARBAGE?

10:36.804 --> 10:38.939
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE SO GOOD
AT DUMPING THINGS.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.343
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK OUT
ON HIM LIKE THAT

10:43.376 --> 10:45.078
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE,
YOU KNOW.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.213
- I WOULD'VE TOLD HIM
TO GO FUCK HIMSELF,

10:46.246 --> 10:47.247
BUT HE WAS ALREADY
DOING THAT

10:47.280 --> 10:48.749
IN THE BACK ROOM
WITH RAGE.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.250
- HOW CAN YOU BE
SUCH A SHIT,

10:50.283 --> 10:51.852
AFTER ALL
HE'S DONE FOR YOU?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.120
- I KNOW
WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.287
- AND YOU KNEW WHO HE WAS,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.189
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.
- YEAH!

10:56.223 --> 10:57.958
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.226
- AND DID YOU THINK THAT YOU
COULD CHANGE HIM?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.028
THAT HE WOULD CHANGE
FOR YOU?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.930
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.233
- OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S OVER.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.035
ON TO THE NEXT.
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.204
- SO DID YOU.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.906
FROM THE FIRST NIGHT
THAT WE MET,

11:12.940 --> 11:14.374
AND HE TOOK ME HOME
AND FUCKED ME,

11:14.407 --> 11:15.275
YOU HAVE WANTED ME GONE.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.045
WELL, MIKEY, YOU FINALLY GOT
YOUR WISH.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.313
THERE'S NOTHING STANDING
IN YOUR WAY ANY MORE.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.782
HE'S ALL YOURS.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.752
YOU KNOW, SINCE YOU'RE
NO LONGER WITH BRIAN,

11:24.785 --> 11:27.988
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON FOR
YOU TO BE HERE, IS THERE?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.389
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO US ALL A FAVOR,

11:29.422 --> 11:33.060
INCLUDING YOURSELF,
AND DISAPPEAR?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.801
- NOW HUDDLE IN JUST
A LITTLE CLOSER TOGETHER.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.369
- OKAY NOW.
SAY "CUNNILINGUS."

11:42.402 --> 11:44.004
- [gagging]

11:44.037 --> 11:45.338
[all laugh]

11:45.372 --> 11:48.942

PRECIOUS.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.011
- OKAY, WE'LL SEE YOU TWO
LOVEBIRDS LATER.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.012
- BYE.
- BYE-BYE.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.180
- LATER.
- SEE YA.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.015
- BYE.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.383
- THEY THINK WE DID IT.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.218
- EVERYBODY THINKS
WE DID IT.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.954
- WELL, CAN WE HELP IT IF THEY
MAKE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS?

12:00.988 --> 12:02.756
- DIDN'T THEY MAKE
CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS

12:02.790 --> 12:05.225
BECAUSE WE LET THEM
MAKE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS?

12:05.258 --> 12:08.862
- IT'S NOT AS IF WE LIED
TO THEM...

12:08.896 --> 12:10.297
OR DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.499
- WE SO WANTED TO DO IT.
- BUT IT WAS LATE.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.034
- I, FOR ONE, HAD FAR TOO MANY
RAGE-TINIS.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.268
- I COULD BARELY
KEEP MY EYES OPEN.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.204
- THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
WE WERE ASLEEP.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.106
- WELL, AT LEAST WE WERE
IN THE SAME BED TOGETHER.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.041
- YOU KNOW, WHICH MEANS,
TECHNICALLY,

12:21.074 --> 12:24.211
WE DID SLEEP TOGETHER.
- TECHNICALLY.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.514
- ANYWAY,
WHEN WE FINALLY DO...

12:27.547 --> 12:28.515
- IT.
- IT...

12:28.548 --> 12:29.850
- [chuckles]

12:29.883 --> 12:31.384
- WE WANT IT TO
BE JUST RIGHT.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.519
RIGHT?

12:32.552 --> 12:33.987
- RIGHT.

12:34.021 --> 12:38.959
- ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
INCREDIBLY RIGHT.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.427
- BEAUTIFULLY RIGHT.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.969
- NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.
OF COURSE.

12:49.002 --> 12:49.970
UH, I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.304
IT'S JUST THAT, UH,

12:51.338 --> 12:53.140
SINCE I DECIDED NOT TO GO
TO TIBET AFTER ALL,

12:53.173 --> 12:55.542
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
YOU WOULD...

12:55.575 --> 12:57.911
OH.
OKAY THEN.

12:57.945 --> 13:01.014
UM, I HOPE ALL GOES WELL.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.315
YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU TOO. HEH.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.917
BYE.
[phone beeps off]

13:03.951 --> 13:06.186
BITCH.
- NO LUCK?

13:06.219 --> 13:07.921
- OH, SHE SAID SHE SIGNED
THE LEASE IN GOOD FAITH,

13:07.955 --> 13:09.422
AND SHE INTENDS TO STAY.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.992
WHY DID I HAVE TO SUBLET
MY PLACE TO A LAW PROFESSOR?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.560
- HEH.
- WELL...

13:13.593 --> 13:15.262
GUESS I'D BETTER START
SEARCHING.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.997
CHECK OUT CAMPUS HOUSING.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.298
- WHY DO THAT?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.367
- I'VE GOT TO FIND
SOMEPLACE TO LIVE.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.202
- LIVE HERE.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.307
- WELL, LIVE HERE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

13:27.340 --> 13:30.010
OR LIVE HERE...
FOR GOOD?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.211
- FOR GOOD.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.017
WHY NOT?
- OH...

13:37.050 --> 13:38.251
IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

13:38.285 --> 13:40.387
ARE WE READY FOR THIS?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.255
I MEAN, WE'VE--
WE'VE NEVER DISCUSSED IT.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.424
- WHAT'S TO DISCUSS?

13:44.457 --> 13:46.426
- IT'S A COMMITMENT.
- AREN'T WE COMMITTED?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.561
- OF COURSE WE ARE.
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

13:48.595 --> 13:51.131
YOU AFRAID WE'RE NOT
GOING TO BE COMPATIBLE?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.033
- HEH, WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.068
- ALL RIGHT,
PROFESSOR BRUCKNER,

13:55.102 --> 13:57.070
DO YOU THROW WILD PARTIES?

13:57.104 --> 13:58.505
DO YOU PLAY LOUD MUSIC
ALL NIGHT?

13:58.538 --> 14:01.241
DO YOU SPEND HOURS
IN THE BATHROOM?

14:01.274 --> 14:02.209
LET'S SEE.
WHAT ELSE AM I FORGETTING?

14:02.242 --> 14:04.978
- JUST THIS.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.915
- MM.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.649
I SAY WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG
JUST FINE.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.618
- MM-HMM.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.486
- HI, BOYS.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.956
HOPE I'M INTERRUPTING
SOMETHING.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.959
EM, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO BEN MOVING IN HERE?

14:18.992 --> 14:21.128
- UM, WELL, IT'S...

14:21.161 --> 14:25.232
KIND OF A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN A SMALL SPACE.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.534
BUT HEY, I LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN A SMALL SPACE.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.369
[all chuckling]

14:29.402 --> 14:32.072
- WHAT ABOUT YOU AND...
TED?

14:32.105 --> 14:33.373
- YEAH, WHAT ABOUT
YOU AND TED?

14:33.406 --> 14:34.674
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO BITE THE BULLET

14:34.707 --> 14:36.109
AND TELL HIM NO.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.544
- WELL, LET'S JUST SAY

14:37.577 --> 14:40.513
I DECIDED TO BITE
SOMETHING ELSE.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.050
- IT'S GREAT YOU GUYS
DECIDED TO GET TOGETHER.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.619
- TO THINK HE'S BEEN RIGHT
IN FRONT OF MY NOSE ALL ALONG.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.356
- STILL, I CAN'T
IMAGINE HAVING SEX

14:49.389 --> 14:51.124
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.096
- REALLY?

14:56.129 --> 14:57.297
SO--SO WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.533
BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T IMAGINE IT, WHAT?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.135
TEDDY AND I DON'T DESERVE
TO BE AS HAPPY

15:02.169 --> 15:03.270
AS YOU AND BEN?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.138
- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

15:05.172 --> 15:08.008
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD,

15:08.041 --> 15:12.345
INCLUDING THE HOTTEST SEX.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.281
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.416
[both chuckle]

16:26.086 --> 16:28.621
- HOW COULD YOU JUST LET HIM
WALK OUT LIKE THAT?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.523
- WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
HAD ME DO?

16:30.557 --> 16:32.759
THROW MYSELF DOWN ON MY KNEES
AND BEG HIM NOT TO GO?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.794
- WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED
HE LEFT.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.729
IN FACT, I SAW IT COMING.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.365
- DID YOU HEAR THAT,
SONNY BOY?

16:38.398 --> 16:40.300
WHAT A PERCEPTIVE PUSS
YOUR MAMA IS.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.402
- WELL, IT WASN'T JUST ME.
IT WAS EVERYONE.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.204
THE WAY YOU TREATED HIM,
REFUSING TO MAKE

16:44.237 --> 16:45.538
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST
ROMANTIC GESTURE.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.708
IT'S NO WONDER
HE FOUND SOMEONE ELSE.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.610
HOWEVER...

16:51.811 --> 16:54.247
MMM.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.649
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.287
- FOR WHAT?
- TO GET HIM BACK.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.588
- OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT

17:01.621 --> 17:03.656
FUCKING SUPERIOR SNEER.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.558
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL HIM
YOU LOVE HIM.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.461
- IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK,
A SMALL SACRIFICE.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.130
- AND THEN WE COULD BE
A HAPPY COUPLE,

17:10.163 --> 17:12.799
LIKE YOU AND MELANIE,
OR...

17:12.832 --> 17:14.134
OR MIKEY AND THE PROFESSOR.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.802
AND, GOD HELP US,
TED AND EMMETT.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.737
- AND WHAT IS SO TERRIBLE
WITH THAT?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.672
- NOTHING.
IT'S JUST THAT

17:19.706 --> 17:21.374
I'M NOT A DYKE.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.243
OR ONE OF THE GROWING LEGIONS
OF DICKLESS FAGS

17:23.276 --> 17:24.711
WHO THINK THAT,
BY IMITATING THEM,

17:24.744 --> 17:27.380
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND
TRUE HAPPINESS.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.848
- SO YOU'D RATHER BE ALONE,

17:28.881 --> 17:30.850
THAN BE WITH THE ONE PERSON
WHO LOVED YOU ENOUGH

17:30.883 --> 17:32.819
TO ALMOST PUT UP
WITH ALL YOUR BULLSHIT...

17:32.852 --> 17:35.755
- I NEVER LOVED HIM.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.424
AND EVEN IF I DID,
I'D NEVER ASK HIM

17:37.457 --> 17:38.858
TO PUT MY NEEDS
ABOVE HIS OR...

17:38.891 --> 17:41.528
BE SOMETHING HE'S NOT
TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.663
I'D TELL HIM IF HE'S NOT
GETTING WHAT HE WANTS,

17:43.696 --> 17:45.698
THEN GO FIND IT
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.101
- WELL, HE CERTAINLY
LEARNED HIS LESSON.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.506
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.181
- KIKI, THE NEW WAITRESS,

18:01.214 --> 18:03.516
FORMERLY KENNY THE WAITER,
[slap counter]

18:03.550 --> 18:05.652
TOLD ME THAT JUSTIN
QUIT TODAY,

18:05.685 --> 18:07.754
JUST LIKE THAT.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.691
WHERE IN THE FUCK
IS THE CHEESE GRATER?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.128
OH.
OH, AND GET THIS.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.363
ON HIS WAY OUT THE DOOR,
HE SAYS,

18:16.396 --> 18:18.431
"BE SURE AND TELL DEBBIE
I SAID GOOD-BYE."

18:18.465 --> 18:20.467
LIKE HE WAS GOING AROUND
THE GODDAMN CORNER.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.475
- UGH.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.643
- THERE'S NO MEAT IN THIS.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.812
- THE GIRLS WANTED
VEGETARIAN.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.647
- LESBIAN LASAGNA.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.183
- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
MICHAEL,

18:36.216 --> 18:37.417
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE
TO EAT PUSSY.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.651
- MOTHER!

18:38.685 --> 18:40.553
- AND AFTER ALL I DID
FOR THAT KID.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.555
- AFTER WHAT WE ALL DID.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.923
I TOLD HIM,
LOUD AND CLEAR.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.758
- TOLD HIM WHAT?

18:45.792 --> 18:48.528
- THAT HE'S A SELFISH,
UNGRATEFUL LITTLE PRICK,

18:48.561 --> 18:51.898
AND HE SHOULD GET THE FUCK
OUT OF OUR LIVES.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.634
- YOU TOLD HIM THAT?
- I SURE DID.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.376
- GIVE ME THAT.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.677
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

19:04.711 --> 19:06.513
- WHATEVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN THOSE TWO BOYS

19:06.546 --> 19:07.880
IS NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN
BUSINESS.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.383
- BRIAN HAPPENS TO BE
MY BEST FRIEND.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.385
- YEAH, I KNOW ALL ABOUT
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.786
AND IF YOU ASK ME,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.788
JUSTIN DID THE RIGHT THING.
HOPEFULLY, THIS...

19:15.822 --> 19:18.258
ETHAN KID
WILL APPRECIATE HIM.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.659
- BRIAN APPRECIATED HIM.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.361
HE DID EVERYTHING FOR HIM.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.896
- EVERYTHING BUT LOVE HIM.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.767
BUT THEN
HE CAN'T LOVE ANYBODY.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.204
NOT EVEN YOU.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.642
[pots clattering]

19:35.675 --> 19:37.677
- "THE TIME PASSED,

19:37.710 --> 19:40.547
"AND IT LOOKED AS IF BEAUTY
WOULD NEVER RETURN.

19:40.580 --> 19:44.351
"AND SO THE BEAST SHUT HIMSELF
AWAY FROM THE WORLD,

19:44.384 --> 19:47.954
IN LONELINESS AND DESPAIR."

19:47.987 --> 19:49.622
HEY. HEY, HEY.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.291
IT'S ONLY A FAIRY TALE.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.526
- I KNOW.
[grunts]

19:53.560 --> 19:56.529
- LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.997
A PHOTO, RIGHT AFTER
WE GOT TOGETHER.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.533
- EIGHT YEARS.
HMM.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.970
- GOES BY IN A BLINK.
- A FLASH.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.405
- A SMILE.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.707
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.776
- NEITHER HAVE YOU.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.479
[both giggling]

20:12.512 --> 20:13.913
- LIAR.
- LIAR!

[doorbell rings]

20:20.887 --> 20:22.589
- CUTIE!

LINZ, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.659
OH, HEY, SWEETIE.
COME ON IN.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.994
- I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.729
- NO, WE WERE JUST SETTING UP
FOR THE PARTY.

20:29.762 --> 20:30.863
- YOU'LL BE HERE,
WON'T YOU?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.532
- ACTUALLY,
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.866
- I-I CAME BY NOW
TO GIVE YOU GUYS THIS.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.602
- OH, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO BRING US...

20:35.635 --> 20:37.337
- HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.472
- UH, WAIT.
YOU JUST GOT HERE.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.740
- ETHAN'S WAITING FOR ME.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.409
- WELL, YOU CAN BRING HIM TOO,
IF YOU WANT.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.444
- AND IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT RUNNING INTO BRIAN,

20:44.477 --> 20:45.612
FORGET IT.

20:45.645 --> 20:46.779
THIS IS THE LAST PLACE
HE'D BE.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.015
- IT WASN'T JUST THAT.
I...

20:49.048 --> 20:50.783
FIGURED IT WOULD BE EASIER
FOR YOU GUYS

20:50.817 --> 20:52.619
IF I WASN'T AROUND.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.654
- WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.623
- YOU WERE
HIS FRIENDS FIRST.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.525
- BUT YOU'RE OUR FRIEND TOO.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.892
WE LOVE YOU THE SAME
AS HIM...

20:59.926 --> 21:01.828
- IF NOT MORE.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.831
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
HOLD ON TO THAT,

21:04.864 --> 21:06.933
AND GIVE IT TO US
AT THE PARTY?

21:18.645 --> 21:21.648
- HI.
- HI.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.651
I WAS HOPING YOU'D
MAKE YOUR WAY OVER HERE.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.853
- HEH.
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

21:26.886 --> 21:29.722
MY GOD, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
LIVE TO SEE THE DAY.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.791
BRIAN KINNEY, REJECTED.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.728
- THE NASDAQ OF FAGS.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.063
- I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'VE GOT TO BE SO CAREFUL

21:37.096 --> 21:39.098
WHAT YOU PUT IT INTO
THESE DAYS.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.568

21:44.837 --> 21:46.473
- DID YOU HEAR
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING?

21:46.506 --> 21:49.376
- MEAN, VICIOUS CUNTS.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.478
SELF-LOATHING STEREOTYPES.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.680
- FUNNY, I THOUGHT THEY SOUNDED
AN AWFUL LOT LIKE US.

21:53.713 --> 21:54.847
- WE'RE ALLOWED
TO TALK THAT WAY.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.949
WE'RE HIS FRIENDS.
- MM.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.085
[laughter]

21:59.118 --> 22:00.587
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO OVER

22:00.620 --> 22:02.689
AND LET HIM INSULT US
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

22:02.722 --> 22:04.824
- OH, GOOD IDEA.
MIGHT MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.426
- I THOUGHT YOU
TWO'D BE HOME

22:06.459 --> 22:08.495
STAINING THE SHEETS.
[laughs]

22:08.528 --> 22:10.497
- WHY, IT MUST BE...

22:10.530 --> 22:11.564
MM...DEBBIE.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.766
- [laughs]
- OH, AND VIC.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.402
THE NEW TWOSOME IN TOWN.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.869
- I THINK IT'S GREAT.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.405
AND DON'T LET
ANYONE TELL YOU

22:18.438 --> 22:19.706
THE ODDS
ARE STACKED AGAINST YOU.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.574
- WHAT ODDS?

22:21.608 --> 22:22.875
- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, VIC,

22:22.909 --> 22:24.444
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BRING UP
CARLOS, ARE YOU?

22:24.477 --> 22:25.612
YOU'LL SCARE THE FUCKING SHIT
OUT OF THEM.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.979
- I WASN'T PLANNING TO.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.782
- WHO, UM...
WHO'S CARLOS?

22:29.816 --> 22:32.585
- FORGET IT.
MY SISTER'S GOT A BIG MOUTH.

22:32.619 --> 22:33.920
- NEVER NOTICED.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.623
- HE AND VIC WERE BEST FRIENDS.
LIKE YOU TWO.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.591
I MEAN, FOR YEARS
THEY WERE INSEPARABLE.

22:38.625 --> 22:39.826
AND THEN ONE DAY,
CARLOS SAYS TO VIC,

22:39.859 --> 22:41.027
"I'M IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY."

22:41.060 --> 22:43.129
VIC SAYS, "WHO?"
CARLOS SAYS, "YOU."

22:43.162 --> 22:44.831
I TRIED TO WARN THEM
NOT TO MESS WITH A GOOD THING,

22:44.864 --> 22:46.666
BUT THEY WENT AHEAD WITH IT
ANYWAY.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.867
AND THREE MONTHS LATER,

22:47.900 --> 22:50.002
CARLOS VANISHES
WITHOUT A TRACE,

22:50.036 --> 22:51.838
AND THIS ONE'S
AROUND THE BEND.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.640
- YOU'RE LEAVING OUT
A FEW DETAILS.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.141
- THE POINT IS...

22:55.174 --> 22:56.676
- THE POINT IS,

22:56.709 --> 22:58.611
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THEM.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.647
HAVE A NICE NIGHT, GUYS.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.182
- HAVE A NICE NIGHT,
HONEYS.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.817
[chuckles]

23:07.987 --> 23:09.622
- I NEVER REALIZED
YOU HAD...

23:09.656 --> 23:11.023
SO MANY CLOTHES.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.159
- WELL, I NEVER REALIZED
YOUR CLOSET WAS SO SMALL.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.728
- WELL, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO CRAM IT ALL IN?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.630
- YOU KNOW, WE NEVER
HAD PROBLEMS BEFORE.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.732
[playful growl]

23:19.766 --> 23:21.167
- MM-MMM. WHA--

23:21.200 --> 23:24.003
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO...
BE MOVING YOU IN.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.705
[both giggling]

23:25.738 --> 23:26.806
ALL RIGHT.
- AHH.

23:26.839 --> 23:27.974
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.709
[laughing]
WELL, NOT RIGHT HERE.

23:29.742 --> 23:30.910
- I KNOW.
THESE ARE HARD.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.044
YOU HAVE...
- OKAY.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.780
[grunting]
THEY'RE LIKE...

23:33.813 --> 23:34.847
- I LEAVE THE TWO OF YOU
ALONE

23:34.881 --> 23:36.549
FOR FIVE MINUTES...

23:36.583 --> 23:38.685
- CHRIST, BRIAN.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.520
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

23:40.553 --> 23:41.954
MY WIDDLE KEY.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.156
- THAT'S FOR EMERGENCIES.
- EXACTLY.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.526
IF I DON'T FIND SOMEONE
TO GO TO BABYLON WITH ME,

23:46.559 --> 23:48.427
I'LL DIE.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.836
- WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

23:56.869 --> 23:59.005
GO ON, GET OUT.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.841
BEN'S JUST MOVING IN.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.943
- SUFFERING SAPPHO.

24:03.976 --> 24:04.844
YOU TOO.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.079
- LOOK, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.848
- MICHAEL.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.088
- WHY DON'T YOU
GO WITH HIM?

24:16.122 --> 24:17.690
- NOW?
- COME ON, LOOK--

24:17.724 --> 24:18.958
LOOK AT HIM.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.127
POOR GUY
NEEDS A FRIEND.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.963
I WOULD TOO,
IF I EVER LOST YOU.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.898
- BUT WHAT ABOUT US?
THIS IS YOUR FIRST NIGHT HERE.

24:25.932 --> 24:29.068
- AND THERE'LL BE OTHERS.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.670
I LIVE HERE NOW,

24:30.703 --> 24:32.038
REMEMBER?
- [chuckling]

24:33.139 --> 24:34.807
MMM.

24:37.544 --> 24:38.845
MMM.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.848
- * YOU THRILL ME

24:41.881 --> 24:44.717
* ALL NIGHT LONG

24:44.751 --> 24:45.885
[buzzing]

24:45.918 --> 24:48.020
* ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT

24:48.054 --> 24:50.590
- * THROUGH THE NIGHT

24:50.623 --> 24:51.891
- CAN I COME IN NOW?

24:51.924 --> 24:53.760
- HOLD ON. WHOA.

24:53.793 --> 24:56.596
- * JUST WE TWO

24:56.629 --> 24:58.965
- * ALL NIGHT LONG

24:58.998 --> 25:01.000
- * ALL NIGHT LONG

25:01.033 --> 25:02.569
- OKAY.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.672
- * ALL NIGHT LONG

25:05.705 --> 25:07.774
- JESUS.
[chuckling]

25:07.807 --> 25:09.809
LOOKS LIKE FAO SCHWARTZ
DECIDED TO OPEN

25:09.842 --> 25:10.910
AN ADULT TOYS
DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.080
- SHUT UP AND GET IN BED.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.683
- OKAY.

25:16.716 --> 25:17.750
WELL, CLOSE YOUR EYES.

25:17.784 --> 25:18.985
- WHAT FOR?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.720
- I'M MODEST.
- MODEST?

25:20.753 --> 25:22.922
I'VE SEEN YOU WHACK OFF
ON THE WEBSITE 100 TIMES.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.757
- WELL, THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.759
THAT WAS WORK.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.027
THIS IS YOU AND ME.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.796
IT'S OUR
FIRST TIME.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.030
I WANT IT TO BE INNOCENT,

25:31.063 --> 25:32.632
YOU KNOW, FILLED WITH...

25:32.665 --> 25:33.900
ANTICIPATION, AND...

25:33.933 --> 25:36.102
AND DISCOVERY...

25:36.135 --> 25:37.269
JOY.

25:37.303 --> 25:38.671
- [scoffs]

25:38.705 --> 25:40.306
- NOW, GO ON.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.274
- [sighs]

25:47.614 --> 25:51.283
- [giggles]

25:51.317 --> 25:54.253
OKAY, YOU CAN OPEN THEM.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.926
- [sighs]

25:59.959 --> 26:04.096
- WELL...HERE WE ARE.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.666
- YOU'D THINK MY HEART WAS
RUNNING IN THE PREAKNESS.

26:06.699 --> 26:07.967
- MY HANDS ARE COLD AS ICE.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.202
FEEL.
- [screams]

26:10.236 --> 26:12.071
- SORRY.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.073
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.743
WE JUST NEED TO...CALM DOWN.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.611
TAKE IT EASY.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.112
GO SLOW.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.616
- AND DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH.

26:23.650 --> 26:31.157
SO IN CASE THERE'S NO, YOU KNOW,
FIREWORKS OR FANFARE OR...

26:31.190 --> 26:34.026
THE PITTSBURGH POPS
PLAYING THE 1812 OVERTURE,

26:34.060 --> 26:37.163
WE WON'T END UP
LIKE VIC AND CARLOS.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.135
- WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAPPENED?

26:43.169 --> 26:44.370
- [sighs]
IT'S BEST NOT TO KNOW.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.706
[chuckles]
IT MIGHT INCAPACITATE US

26:46.739 --> 26:49.876
WITH SELF-DOUBT AND FEAR.

26:56.783 --> 27:00.319
- TEDDY?

27:00.352 --> 27:03.289
- YEAH?

27:03.322 --> 27:07.994
- YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.
RIGHT?

27:08.027 --> 27:11.063
- YOU TOO.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.398
OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD,

27:12.431 --> 27:16.135
THERE'S NO ONE
I FEEL CLOSER TO THAN YOU.

27:16.168 --> 27:19.405
- SO WHAT IF
THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT?

27:19.438 --> 27:23.910
CAN WE STILL GO BACK
TO BEING JUST FRIENDS?

27:27.947 --> 27:30.049
- [sighs]

27:53.039 --> 27:56.008
[dance music]

27:56.042 --> 28:04.150
*

28:12.324 --> 28:13.726
- BRIAN.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.795
BRIAN!

28:15.828 --> 28:18.064
BRIAN, I'VE GOT TO GO.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.465
BEN'S WAITING.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.200
- I'M SURE THE PROFESSOR'S
ALL TUCKED IN

28:21.233 --> 28:24.937
AND IN DREAMLAND BY NOW.

28:24.971 --> 28:28.174
VITAMINS?
- NO, THANKS.

28:28.207 --> 28:32.344
- [snorts]
MMM.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.781
IT'S JUST LIKE OLD TIMES,
ISN'T IT?

28:34.814 --> 28:37.249
- YEAH, YOU GET LOADED,
AND I GET TO TAKE YOU HOME.

28:37.283 --> 28:41.387
I MEAN...JUST YOU AND ME.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.996
- [snorts]

28:50.029 --> 28:53.766
- OOH!

28:53.800 --> 28:55.768
COME ON.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.263
- WHETHER IT WAS THE MUSIC

29:24.296 --> 29:27.133
OR BRIAN'S SECRET BLEND OF 11
HERBS AND SPICES

29:27.166 --> 29:28.935
OR BECAUSE IT WAS,
LIKE HE SAID,

29:28.968 --> 29:31.570
THE WAY IT USED TO BE,
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO VANISH

29:31.603 --> 29:35.541
UNTIL IT WAS JUST
THE TWO OF US UP THERE.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.543
ALONE.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.183
- RIGHT. CAN YOU
JUST GATHER IN A GROUP?

29:44.216 --> 29:46.418
THAT'S IT.
OKAY, NOW SAY "PUSSY!"

29:46.452 --> 29:48.154
all: PUSSY!

29:48.187 --> 29:50.322
[all laugh]

29:57.063 --> 29:59.198
- THIS NEARLY WAS OURS.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.333
- A FLOUR-LESS ANNIVERSARY CAKE.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.534
- SANDALWOOD CANDLES.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.503
"HAPPY 8th.
LOVE, DORY AND ROBYN."

30:04.536 --> 30:05.504
HMMM.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.505
all: PUSSY!

30:06.538 --> 30:08.140
[all laugh]

30:08.174 --> 30:10.576
- AND OUR LATEST PHOTO
FOR OUR KEEPSAKE ALBUM.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.245
SHOWING US A LITTLE BIT OLDER
THAN THE YEAR BEFORE.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.580
- AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.315
- LYING TO EACH OTHER.

30:16.348 --> 30:19.018
- "YOU LOOK GREAT!"
- "NO, YOU LOOK GREAT."

30:19.051 --> 30:20.853
- "NO, YOU LOOK GREAT."
- "YOU--"

30:20.887 --> 30:22.288
- HEY, LOVEBIRDS.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.623
- YOU LOOK GREAT!
- OH, STOP.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.092
- LOVEBIRDS.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.360
- HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.
- HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.196
- NEXT YEAR IT'LL BE YOU TWO.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.164
- YEAH, JUST LIKE US.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.966
- BYE!
- HAVE FUN.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.868
- SEE YOU LATER.
[chuckles]

30:35.902 --> 30:38.204
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

30:38.237 --> 30:41.373
[laughter]

30:44.643 --> 30:46.612
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
SO MANY COUPLES?

30:46.645 --> 30:48.547
- AH, THAT'S
THE NEW WORLD ORDER.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.917
- WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE HETEROS
IS GOOD FOR THE HOMOS.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.452
- YOU SOUND SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE
YOUR DANCING PARTNER.

30:53.485 --> 30:54.653
WHAT TIME DID YOU
GET IN LAST NIGHT?

30:54.686 --> 30:55.654
- NOT TOO LATE.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.023
YOU WERE ALREADY ASLEEP.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.657
- HMM. DID YOU HAVE FUN?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.959
- SAME OLD, SAME OLD.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.327
- YEAH, SAME OLD HOT MUSIC,

31:01.360 --> 31:02.661
SAME OLD HALF-NAKED MEN.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.897
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

31:04.931 --> 31:06.432
- THE GIRLS INVITED HIM.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.135
- YEAH, AND HE
HAS THE FUCKING NERVE

31:09.168 --> 31:10.369
TO BRING HIS NEW BOYFRIEND.

31:10.402 --> 31:13.372
- HI. WE'RE SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.574
IN OUR--IN OUR YARD.
[laughs]

31:15.607 --> 31:18.110
- I SAY WE GO
FOR THE KING EDWARD.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.212
- I SAY THE QUEEN MARY.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.680
- WHY DON'T YOU EACH
GET A PRINCE ALBERT

31:21.713 --> 31:23.115
AND BE DONE WITH IT?

31:23.149 --> 31:24.383
- WE'RE NOT
DISCUSSING PIERCINGS.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.918
THEY'RE SILVER PATTERNS.

31:25.952 --> 31:28.320
AND HE'S BEING HIS USUAL
GODDAMNED STUBBORN SELF.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.656
- I'M STUBBORN?
I'M STUBBORN.

31:30.689 --> 31:33.525
WE FINALLY DECIDE ON
BLUE CORNFLOWER FOR PLATES.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.394
WE REGISTERED AND EVERYTHING.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.196
AND THEN HE CHANGES HIS MIND.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.430
- I'M ALLOWED TO CHANGE MY MIND.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.932
- WELL THEN, MAYBE
I SHOULD CHANGE MIND

31:39.966 --> 31:41.133
ABOUT EVEN HAVING THE CEREMONY.

31:41.167 --> 31:42.534
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT TO ME

31:42.568 --> 31:44.103
AFTER BEING TOGETHER
FOR NINE MONTHS?

31:44.136 --> 31:45.537
- CHRIST.

31:45.571 --> 31:49.408
AREN'T THERE ANY GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED QUEERS LEFT?

31:49.441 --> 31:51.477
YOU KNOW,
NOT THAT I GIVE A FUCK,

31:51.510 --> 31:56.415
BUT I KNOW A COUPLE OF BULLS
WHO COULD ADVISE YOU BEARS.

31:56.448 --> 31:59.551
[excited chatter]

32:04.256 --> 32:06.225
- THERE YOU GO, HONEY.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.626
WANNA TAKE THESE
OUTSIDE FOR ME?

32:07.659 --> 32:10.963
THERE ARE PEOPLE WAITING FOR
IT. THANK YOU.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.733
HEY!

32:14.766 --> 32:17.736
HOLD IT.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.240
GET YOUR PERKY LITTLE BUTT
BACK HERE.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.348
SINCE WHEN DO YOU WALK
BY ME AND NOT SAY HELLO?

32:29.381 --> 32:31.183
- DEB, PLEASE.
THIS IS HARD ENOUGH.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.252
- YEAH WELL, YOU'D MAKE IT
EASIER ON YOURSELF

32:33.285 --> 32:35.254
IF YOU SHOWED SOME MANNERS.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.355
- WHO THE FUCK'S HE?

32:36.388 --> 32:39.091
-THIS IS ETHAN.
- HMM.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.427
THE NEW BOYFRIEND.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.362
I'M DEBBIE.
- HI.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.031
- I'VE BEEN KEEPING
AN EYE ON SUNSHINE

32:45.064 --> 32:46.232
EVER SINCE HE LEFT HOME.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.567
- SUNSHINE?

32:48.600 --> 32:50.069
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

32:50.102 --> 32:52.138
- NO.
NO PROBLEM.

32:52.171 --> 32:55.274
- WHATEVER MY SON SAID TO YOU,

32:55.307 --> 32:58.544
HE DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ME
OR ANYONE ELSE.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.312
WE ALL STILL LOVE YOU

33:00.346 --> 33:02.181
AND YOU'RE STILL
A MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.649
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.751
- YES.

33:05.784 --> 33:09.055
- I EXPECT YOU BACK AT THE DINER
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.057
DON'T BE LATE.

33:13.725 --> 33:17.096
- AS FOR YOU.
- MM-HMM?

33:17.129 --> 33:20.066
- YOU'RE FUCKING ADORABLE
IS WHAT YOU ARE.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.434
[chuckles]

33:22.468 --> 33:23.669
- AH, EXCUSE ME?

33:23.702 --> 33:27.005
EXCUSE ME? UM, CAN I--
- OH, SORRY.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.080
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:34.113 --> 33:35.281
- I BELIEVE I WAS INVITED.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.782
- YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T COMING.

33:36.815 --> 33:37.683
- WELL, I WASN'T.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.786
HOWEVER, UH,
MY TWO NEW BEST FRIENDS...

33:40.819 --> 33:43.122
- NED.
- BART.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.290
- THEY CAN'T MAKE UP
THEIR MINDS:

33:44.323 --> 33:45.691
THE QUEEN MARY OR KING EDWARD?

33:45.724 --> 33:47.459
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD
SETTLE IT FOR THEM.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.595
GOTTA PISS.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.139
- CHRIST.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.707
BRIAN.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.542
- WATCH WHERE YOU'RE AIMING.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.777
- CAN'T YOU WAIT
TILL I'M FINISHED?

34:05.811 --> 34:08.680
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
I'VE SEEN IT.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.682
[sighs]

34:13.719 --> 34:16.188
DON'T FORGET
TO WASH YOUR HANDS.

34:16.222 --> 34:19.625
BY THE WAY...

34:19.658 --> 34:22.761
I HOPE YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.440
- THE KING EDWARD IS STUNNING.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.707
-AND THE QUEEN MARY'S A CLASSIC.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.143
BUT WE WENT
WITH THE EMPRESS ALEXANDRA.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.477
IT'S ELEGANT ENOUGH
FOR DINNER--

34:38.510 --> 34:40.246
- BUT STURDY ENOUGH
FOR EVERY DAY.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.447
- YEAH.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.748
- IT'S LOVELY.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.583
- DON'T YOU THINK SO, HONEY?
- LOVELY.

34:44.616 --> 34:45.817
SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU TWO BEEN TOGETHER?

34:45.851 --> 34:47.819
- UH, EIGHT YEARS
AND STILL COUNTING.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.322
- KAYNE HORA!
- KAYNE HORA.

34:50.356 --> 34:55.427
- AND THEY SAID I COULD, YOU
KNOW, SET IT ASIDE ON TIME.

34:55.461 --> 34:56.862
- DO YOU BELIEVE
THE NERVE OF THAT LITTLE TWAT,

34:56.895 --> 34:59.698
SHOWING UP HERE
WITH HIS NEW BOYFRIEND?

34:59.731 --> 35:01.433
I TOLD HIM TO STAY
THE FUCK OUT OF OUR LIVES.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.668
- WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

35:02.701 --> 35:05.137
- AFTER WHAT HE DID?

35:05.171 --> 35:07.206
- HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.407
WE WERE NEVER HAPPILY MARRIED.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.641
HE WAS ALWAYS FREE TO GO,
SO WAS I.

35:09.675 --> 35:10.709
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.378
HE'S A SELFISH LITTLE SHIT.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.446
- BE QUIET, MICHAEL.
- HE USED YOU,

35:14.480 --> 35:15.781
AND HE TOOK FROM YOU

35:15.814 --> 35:17.549
AND HE NEVER GAVE BACK A THING.
- I SAID BE QUIET.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.518
AND THIS IS THE THANKS
YOU GET FOR SAVING HIS LIFE.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.919
IF YOU ASK ME,
IT WASN'T WORTH IT.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.488
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE JUST
LEFT HIM LYING THERE--

35:22.521 --> 35:27.226
[boxing bell dings]
[crowd chants]

35:27.259 --> 35:28.927
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT, FOLKS.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.663
THE INSTANT RECAP
LEADING TO THE SURPRISE PUNCH

35:31.697 --> 35:35.301
THAT LANDED MIGHTY MIKE
NOVOTNY ON HIS KEISTER.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.702

35:36.735 --> 35:39.171
[shocked murmurs]
- SHIT!

35:39.205 --> 35:40.339

35:40.372 --> 35:41.673

OR A DOCTOR?

35:41.707 --> 35:43.375
- BRIAN?
- WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

35:43.409 --> 35:46.478
- YOU FUCKING ANIMAL,
HITTING MY KID.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.713
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

35:47.746 --> 35:49.215
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!
- NO, DON'T!

35:49.248 --> 35:50.382
[glass shatters]

35:50.416 --> 35:52.651
- COME ON.
- MEN ALWAYS DO THAT.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.220
- I'M ALL RIGHT.
- LEMME SEE, SWEETHEART.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.354
LEMME SEE.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.389
- BRIAN, I THINK
YOU BETTER LEAVE.

35:57.423 --> 36:00.259
- NOW!
- ASSHOLE.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.427
DON'T EVEN LOOK AT HIM.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.563
- GO, ASSHOLE.
GET OUT.

36:11.903 --> 36:15.207
- I THINK IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

36:26.452 --> 36:28.987
- NO COLOR WHEEL?

36:29.020 --> 36:32.291
- NO.
- NO DILDOS?

36:32.324 --> 36:35.761
- NO.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.296
NO ROBE?

36:37.329 --> 36:40.299
- JUST ME, IN THE FLESH.

36:53.945 --> 36:57.316
- NOW ARE WE ABSOLUTELY
100% POSITIVE

36:57.349 --> 36:59.551
WE WANNA GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

36:59.585 --> 37:03.689
- ABSOLUTELY 100%?
NO.

37:05.691 --> 37:09.261
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH THE RISK?

37:09.295 --> 37:11.630
- I GUESS WE'LL KNOW
IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.432
- TEN MINUTES?

37:13.465 --> 37:16.302
LET'S, UH--LET'S GIVE IT
AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR.

37:16.335 --> 37:19.271
- [chuckles]

37:21.907 --> 37:26.044
WELL...

37:26.077 --> 37:29.348
HERE GOES.

37:29.381 --> 37:32.551
- UH, WAIT.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.754
I JUST WANT TO SAY
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

37:35.787 --> 37:39.891
I PROMISE
NOT TO VANISH WITHOUT A TRACE.

37:42.394 --> 37:46.665
- AND I PROMISE
NOT TO GO AROUND THE BEND.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.837
- UH, WAIT.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.943
GOOD LUCK, TEDDY.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.316
BREAK A LEG, EM.

38:23.569 --> 38:26.672
[knocks on door]

38:33.512 --> 38:35.881
[bell jingles]

38:35.914 --> 38:39.017
- I'M WORKING.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

38:41.587 --> 38:43.555
- TO GIVE YOU THIS.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.691

IT'S DRIPPING BLOOD!

38:51.463 --> 38:55.701
WHAT'S IN HERE?
- IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S HEART.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.569
[chuckles]

38:57.603 --> 38:59.738
IT'S A KANSAS CITY STEAK.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.840
IT'S $23 A POUND.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.109
STICK IT ON YOUR EYE
AND THEN EAT IT.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.644
- THANKS A FUCKING LOT.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.780
- DOES IT HURT?

39:13.452 --> 39:16.422
- CUT IT OUT.

39:17.623 --> 39:20.759
YOU NEVER HIT ME BEFORE.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.902
BUT I GUESS AFTER WHAT I SAID,
I DESERVED IT.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.508
YOU MUST REALLY LOVE HIM.
- [scoffs]

39:36.542 --> 39:38.977
I-I TOLD HIM FROM DAY ONE,
I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE.

TO MAKE UP WITH HIM.

39:57.763 --> 39:58.864

40:00.198 --> 40:02.801
RAGE, VOLUME ONE,

MIKEY'S BIG DREAM?

40:08.574 --> 40:12.844
