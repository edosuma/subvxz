WEBVTT

03:57.637 --> 03:59.572
Here.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.843
And please, don't cut it up.

04:02.877 --> 04:05.012
I'd like it to last
all day long.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.714
How did you find me?

05:46.747 --> 05:48.315
How did you freakin' find me?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.024
Why are you
following me?

05:57.058 --> 06:00.795
Wife. I just got...
to see wife.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.868
Yeah.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.405
Am I a good actress?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.240
Yeah,
you're great.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.640
Yeah, but you have
to say that.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.343
What if I suck
and no one tells me,

06:49.376 --> 06:51.644
and I just never
get a real part?

06:51.678 --> 06:55.249
Well, you'll stop acting and
you'll pursue a career as a voyeur.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.419
I'm good with that.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.421
Doesn't pay much,
though.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.757
- I'll support you.
- Sucker.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.893
Better start laying off
those cards, then.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.297
So you'll still love me
even if I'm a failure?

07:10.331 --> 07:13.100
- Babe, you are a failure.
- Mean!

07:13.134 --> 07:16.237
And I still
love you.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.439
- The question is...
- Yeah?

07:18.472 --> 07:21.175
Will you still love me
if you're a success?

07:21.208 --> 07:24.345
Of course!

07:24.378 --> 07:27.414
Will you still love
me if I'm a success?

07:27.448 --> 07:32.186
And rich,
and powerful,

07:32.219 --> 07:34.788
and a bitch
with no feelings?

07:36.090 --> 07:38.959
Will you still send me
naked pictures?

07:38.993 --> 07:40.961
Yeah.

07:40.995 --> 07:43.164
Then I will
always love you.

08:04.952 --> 08:08.923
Sam, you must get out there
and do something.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.224
I work two jobs
already.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.059
I'm not
talking about work,

08:12.092 --> 08:14.328
- you work far too much.
- Okay.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.797
And you waste all your time
on that Internet, you know,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.200
cutting up those newspapers
and putting them together.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.368
It's no good.
It's strange.

08:21.402 --> 08:25.239
And why are you wasting your
life washing dishes for me?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.208
Hmm?

08:27.241 --> 08:30.077
I mean, why am I
hiring you?

08:30.110 --> 08:32.279
You know, I should sell this
place and go back to Scotland.

08:32.313 --> 08:35.482
But no, no, no,
I have to look out for you.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.851
What about
your French kids?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.187
Look.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.390
Do me a favor.

08:43.424 --> 08:46.327
Try something new, mm?

08:46.360 --> 08:48.996
Meet a girl.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.868
I know what it's like
to be between two countries.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.771
And believe me,
you can only live in one.

08:59.340 --> 09:03.811
Whatever it was,
it's been over for a long time.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.218
<i>You keep doing this
and I'm gone.</i>

09:11.252 --> 09:13.921
<i>I promise this is
the last time. Don't leave.</i>

09:27.434 --> 09:29.136
<i>Hey, Sam?</i>

09:54.361 --> 09:56.263
Did I catch you
spying again?

09:56.297 --> 10:00.100
<i>You should try it
sometime, you might like it.</i>

10:35.035 --> 10:36.603
<i>Ca va?</i>

10:51.985 --> 10:53.320
<i>Hey, Sam?</i>

10:53.354 --> 10:54.988
Can I talk to you for a sec?

11:12.539 --> 11:15.376
Gilles! What's this crap
in the back?

11:15.409 --> 11:17.077
I don't know!
What is it?

11:17.111 --> 11:18.512
Bunch of boxes
we never opened.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.115
Those must've been there
since the divorce.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.083
- Toss them out.
- You don't wanna see what's in 'em?

11:23.117 --> 11:25.686
No! Then I might be
tempted to keep 'em.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.355
If I haven't opened them in years,
they don't mean anything to me.

11:28.389 --> 11:29.690
Get rid of them.

11:57.251 --> 11:59.453
<i>Tuesday,
you will fall...</i>

11:59.486 --> 12:01.422
<i>head over heels in love
with me on Pont Neuf,</i>

12:01.455 --> 12:04.024
<i>the most romantic bridge
in all of the world.</i>

12:39.460 --> 12:43.063
When I sell this place,
I shall move to Bali.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.665
- Bali?
- Mm.

12:44.698 --> 12:48.502
Somewhere warm,
not like here.

12:48.535 --> 12:52.039
This country is full of Frenchmen.
It's unbearable.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.742
Bali.
It's a possibility.

12:54.776 --> 12:56.643
A dream. My dream.

12:56.677 --> 12:58.713
<i>Everyone
needs dreams.</i>

13:44.726 --> 13:47.561
<i>Mrs. Jenkins
sends her regards.</i>

15:01.335 --> 15:02.536
Sam.

15:11.713 --> 15:13.380
Who's this girl?

15:14.615 --> 15:16.516
Gilles, let me
ask you something.

15:17.651 --> 15:18.853
Is this
the same person?

15:19.921 --> 15:22.522
I don't know.

15:22.556 --> 15:23.825
Let me see.

15:29.864 --> 15:32.366
- No.
- If she wasn't making that face...

15:32.399 --> 15:34.401
Sam, what's this
all about?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.704
You know, when I said
"find a girl,"

15:36.738 --> 15:41.174
I meant a real girl,
not some crazy fantasy.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.878
I'm not crazy.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.557
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Jean?

15:57.591 --> 15:59.259
<i>Yes. Who is this,
please?</i>

15:59.292 --> 16:00.594
I'm an old friend
of Georgia's.

16:01.963 --> 16:04.531
<i>Do you know
how I can reach her?</i>

16:04.564 --> 16:05.733
I'm sorry?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.936
- Is Georgia there?
- <i>What?</i>

16:08.970 --> 16:10.604
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- Do you know where she is?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.307
Sam. Is this Sam?

16:14.341 --> 16:16.510
- Yes.
- <i>She's dead, Sam.</i>

16:16.543 --> 16:19.179
<i>Your fault.
You killed her.</i>

16:32.559 --> 16:33.928
Hello?

16:33.961 --> 16:36.798
<i>Is this
Detective Bill Rice?</i>

16:36.831 --> 16:39.734
- Could be. Who's this?
- <i>Jean Outerbridge.</i>

16:39.767 --> 16:41.903
<i>I'm Georgia's mother.
We met three years ago.</i>

16:41.936 --> 16:44.806
<i>You told me to call you if
I ever spoke to Sam Pivnic.</i>

16:44.839 --> 16:46.406
<i>Well, I just did.</i>

16:46.440 --> 16:48.275
You get any information
on him?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.611
<i>I got a phone number.</i>

17:00.788 --> 17:03.457
<i>Mrs. Jenkins
sends her regards.</i>

17:12.632 --> 17:15.002
<i>Mrs. Jenkins
sends her regards.</i>

17:22.810 --> 17:25.479
<i>Mrs. Jenkins
sends her regards.</i>

17:55.710 --> 17:57.779
Ahem.

17:57.812 --> 17:59.013
<i>Café.</i>

18:00.647 --> 18:02.717
For my best customer.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.484
I have to find out.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.320
- Find out what?
- If they're the same person.

18:07.354 --> 18:10.057
They're not.
Now you know.

18:11.125 --> 18:14.095
I'm going
to L.A., Gilles.

18:14.128 --> 18:16.831
Sam... you're not
thinking clearly.

18:18.099 --> 18:19.934
It's a waste!

18:42.924 --> 18:45.793
It's an old saying.
Rough translation...

18:45.827 --> 18:49.096
"Logic will fail to talk
someone out of something

18:49.130 --> 18:51.866
logic cannot
talk him into."

18:58.005 --> 19:00.440
You're gonna need some money
when you get there, no?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.909
Thank you.

19:01.943 --> 19:04.779
Hmm.

19:07.715 --> 19:09.984
We won't see each other
again, will we?

20:42.276 --> 20:44.946
So the guy left in a real hurry, huh?

20:44.979 --> 20:48.682
Mm.
I've had not a chance to clean it out.

20:48.716 --> 20:52.753
Oh. I promise I
won't judge the messiness.

20:52.787 --> 20:55.222
So, here we are.

20:55.256 --> 20:57.925
It's, uh, it's nice,
and, uh, cozy.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.659
What's behind there?

21:24.151 --> 21:26.187
Who was this guy?

21:26.220 --> 21:30.992
I guess...
I don't really know.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.662
Any idea where he went?

23:14.095 --> 23:15.830
Hey!

23:15.863 --> 23:17.898
You gotta check in
or give me your ticket.

23:17.932 --> 23:21.202
- Right, sorry.
- Don't I know you?

23:21.235 --> 23:22.937
Please, I have
to get in there.

23:22.970 --> 23:25.072
- So do a lot of people.
- I'm just looking for someone.

23:25.106 --> 23:28.641
Stop. I've heard them all
before, okay? Go.

24:03.978 --> 24:06.814
Georgia! Georgia!

24:09.383 --> 24:10.784
Georgia!

24:14.054 --> 24:16.023
Georgia!

24:26.867 --> 24:29.036
<i>I had to borrow
money from my Mom.</i>

24:29.069 --> 24:31.305
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>No, you keep doing this and I'm gone.</i>

24:31.338 --> 24:33.673
<i>I promise this is
the last time. Don't leave.</i>

24:36.010 --> 24:38.412
- Hey. Is your name Sam?
- Shit.

24:39.446 --> 24:42.183
Sam Pivnic?

24:42.216 --> 24:44.385
How do you know that?
Who told you my name?

24:44.418 --> 24:47.021
You did.
In high school.

24:47.054 --> 24:48.889
- It's Kat.
- What?

24:48.923 --> 24:51.192
- Josh's little sister?
- Josh?

24:51.225 --> 24:54.061
Josh Zaro, your friend
from Franklin High?

24:54.094 --> 24:56.430
You came to my house, like,
once a week to play videogames

24:56.463 --> 24:58.032
and never let me play?

24:58.065 --> 25:00.834
- Katherine?
- Oh, it's Kat now.

25:00.868 --> 25:02.336
Your hair!

25:02.369 --> 25:05.005
Yeah, it was...
red back then.

25:05.039 --> 25:07.274
Screamed for attention.

25:07.308 --> 25:09.043
This is my natural color.

25:10.044 --> 25:11.245
Right.

25:14.415 --> 25:17.451
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

25:17.484 --> 25:19.987
But you're not.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.222
What's up?

25:22.389 --> 25:24.225
Nothing.
Nothing's up.

25:24.258 --> 25:27.328
Now you're lying to me.

25:27.361 --> 25:29.530
I've got, like...

25:29.563 --> 25:32.833
25 minutes before I have
to meet someone.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.802
Um...

25:34.835 --> 25:37.404
Wanna grab a cup of coffee
across the street?

25:39.373 --> 25:41.342
Come on. I wanna
hear your story.

25:46.413 --> 25:47.915
Jesus, Sam.

25:49.984 --> 25:51.919
I'm so sorry.

25:51.952 --> 25:53.854
Couldn't protect her.

25:53.887 --> 25:56.290
It was a gas leak.

25:56.323 --> 25:59.260
That was a freak
accident, not your fault.

26:02.563 --> 26:05.032
I'm so sorry.
I've been talking this whole time,

26:05.065 --> 26:07.301
- I didn't mean to unload.
- Oh.

26:07.334 --> 26:09.370
Aren't you
really late?

26:09.403 --> 26:11.405
Oh, no, I was just...

26:11.438 --> 26:14.575
building in a hard out in
case I wanted to escape.

26:14.608 --> 26:16.910
- And you don't.
- Not yet.

26:19.213 --> 26:21.515
So what brought you
to L.A.?

26:24.351 --> 26:26.453
I think Georgia
is alive.

26:26.487 --> 26:29.023
Wait, I thought you...

26:29.056 --> 26:31.358
- just said Georgia died in the fire.
- I know.

26:33.127 --> 26:36.063
All right, this is gonna
sound absolutely insane.

26:36.096 --> 26:39.433
But... I think she changed
her look completely.

26:39.466 --> 26:41.602
Dyed her hair,
removed her tattoos,

26:41.635 --> 26:44.338
and she goes by
Lauren Clerk now.

26:45.406 --> 26:47.341
Jimmy's client?

26:47.374 --> 26:49.276
Like, the 8th lead
of the movie?

26:49.310 --> 26:51.512
I think so.
Maybe.

26:51.545 --> 26:54.515
How is that
even possible?

26:54.548 --> 26:57.217
Have you ever tried to look up
Lauren Clerk's background?

26:57.251 --> 26:58.952
All right, where
she went to high school,

26:58.986 --> 27:00.988
who her parents were,
where she was born.

27:01.021 --> 27:03.524
Turns out I have not.

27:03.557 --> 27:05.292
There's
absolutely nothing.

27:07.261 --> 27:10.397
Sam, Lauren
is not Georgia.

27:33.954 --> 27:36.557
I'm not crazy.

27:36.590 --> 27:41.228
Tsk. I mean, don't worry,
I like a little crazy, but...

27:43.664 --> 27:47.668
Okay, so you have some hardcore
infatuation with some actress.

27:47.702 --> 27:51.405
No! It's not
about Lauren Clerk.

27:52.539 --> 27:55.008
It's about Georgia.

27:55.042 --> 27:56.276
I don't know
what I was thinking,

27:56.310 --> 27:58.178
I just... I wanted
to look her in the eyes.

27:59.279 --> 28:00.881
It's stupid.

28:07.287 --> 28:11.024
Fuck it. Okay,
but you gotta be cool.

28:25.172 --> 28:26.206
I don't see her.

28:27.341 --> 28:28.609
We'll find her.

28:30.377 --> 28:31.612
Could she have skipped
the party?

28:31.645 --> 28:36.450
Relax, okay?
She'll be here.

28:40.254 --> 28:41.488
There, okay?
You see her?

28:43.390 --> 28:44.958
Yeah.

28:44.992 --> 28:46.260
Go talk to her.

28:48.128 --> 28:49.329
I..

28:51.031 --> 28:53.000
Okay, I'll go.

29:22.062 --> 29:23.263
What'd she say?

29:23.297 --> 29:27.401
- She doesn't know you.
- Are you sure?

29:27.434 --> 29:32.039
I mean, yeah, I pointed you
out and she took a good look.

29:33.574 --> 29:35.576
Okay.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.714
Why don't we just
get out of here?

29:47.488 --> 29:50.157
- It's her.
- It's not. She doesn't know you.

29:50.190 --> 29:53.694
- It has to be.
- It's not, okay? Let's just go.

30:03.270 --> 30:04.471
Georgia.

30:07.341 --> 30:10.043
- Hi.
- Hi!

30:18.853 --> 30:21.321
- Hello.
- Hey, luv.

30:21.355 --> 30:25.058
- Who's this?
- Oh, sorry. This is my fiancé, Vince.

30:25.092 --> 30:28.061
Uh... what was
your name again?

30:28.095 --> 30:30.464
- Sam.
- Nice to meet you, man.

30:30.497 --> 30:32.499
Um, Jose wanted
to talk to you

30:32.533 --> 30:34.434
- about the details for next weekend.
- Okay.

30:34.468 --> 30:36.738
Hey, listen, I just have to steal
her away for just a second, man.

30:36.771 --> 30:39.273
- Okay? Cheers.
- Yes.

30:39.306 --> 30:41.108
That was weird!
Who is he?

30:41.141 --> 30:42.509
I don't know.

30:53.287 --> 30:55.723
I just couldn't tell
what she was thinking.

30:55.757 --> 30:58.592
She was thinking,
"Who's this fucking guy?"

30:58.625 --> 31:01.528
No. It was her.

31:01.562 --> 31:03.765
Okay, I'm trying to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

31:03.798 --> 31:06.466
but were you not
at the party I was at?

31:06.500 --> 31:09.169
Why on earth would you
think that was her?

31:09.202 --> 31:10.504
It was the necklace.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.406
She was wearing the
necklace that I gave her.

31:12.439 --> 31:14.541
It's a single diamond
on a chain.

31:14.575 --> 31:17.812
Oh, my God!
A million girls have that necklace.

31:17.845 --> 31:21.181
I had that necklace
when I was 16.

31:22.683 --> 31:24.651
If it was her,
why wouldn't she acknowledge you?

31:26.320 --> 31:28.890
I don't know.

31:28.923 --> 31:32.125
Maybe it's because
Lauren is not Georgia,

31:32.159 --> 31:34.695
and you are
just batshit.

31:46.373 --> 31:49.176
I wasn't
expecting this.

31:51.612 --> 31:53.614
What were you
expecting?

31:53.647 --> 31:56.650
Answers. Love.
I don't know.

31:56.683 --> 31:58.753
Definitely not this.

32:08.896 --> 32:11.766
- You know what I always say?
- What's that?

32:13.835 --> 32:15.369
Fuck it.

32:19.606 --> 32:21.876
Let's go, crazy.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.634
A little paranoid?

32:47.668 --> 32:49.503
Think of it as careful.

32:49.536 --> 32:52.673
Well you say potato.
Make yourself at home.

33:20.902 --> 33:23.470
Put your weapon back.

33:23.503 --> 33:25.940
Sorry,
I know I shouldn't be snooping.

33:25.973 --> 33:28.910
My Dad insisted on it
when I moved here.

33:28.943 --> 33:32.245
He thinks L.A.
is dangerous.

33:32.279 --> 33:33.413
Should I be
intimidated?

33:33.447 --> 33:35.983
Very.

33:36.017 --> 33:38.720
He also got me this
for my birthday.

33:41.022 --> 33:42.757
He's a great Dad.

33:42.790 --> 33:44.926
Kat, look, I'm not gonna be
very good company tonight.

33:44.959 --> 33:46.728
Okay, quiet.

33:46.761 --> 33:49.997
You're staying because I
do not feel like driving.

33:50.031 --> 33:53.835
Do you want something to drink?
I have tequila or tequila.

33:55.602 --> 33:56.971
Sure.

34:03.044 --> 34:04.746
Were you this nice
in high school?

34:05.813 --> 34:07.782
You don't
remember me.

34:07.815 --> 34:09.483
Maybe that's
a good thing.

34:09.516 --> 34:12.920
You were into music.

34:12.954 --> 34:16.489
Yeah. That's why
I came to L.A.

34:16.523 --> 34:20.360
I was in a band.
We actually got a record deal.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.797
Couldn't handle
success. Broke up.

34:22.830 --> 34:26.565
- Why?
- It was a whole like <i>Behind the Music</i> thing.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.969
One of us got
a drug problem,

34:29.003 --> 34:31.706
one of us was
in a psycho relationship,

34:31.739 --> 34:32.907
one of us
got arrogant.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.408
Which one of those
were you?

34:36.744 --> 34:37.911
Which one
do you think?

34:40.514 --> 34:41.648
All of them.

34:43.985 --> 34:46.053
You <i>do</i> remember me.

35:03.704 --> 35:05.572
Why weren't we better
friends back then?

35:05.605 --> 35:08.475
Um, I had a red
fauxhawk

35:08.508 --> 35:11.746
and you were
a Golden Retriever...

35:11.779 --> 35:14.048
really sweet,
not that interesting.

35:14.081 --> 35:16.550
And what about now?

35:16.583 --> 35:19.053
Oh, now you're
a street mutt.

35:19.086 --> 35:20.822
I like that.

35:20.855 --> 35:23.791
- Now my life's a disaster.
- I know.

35:23.825 --> 35:26.828
Sometimes you have
to become a new person.

35:27.862 --> 35:29.462
You can be reborn.

35:29.496 --> 35:31.098
Easy on the religion.

35:31.132 --> 35:34.501
I don't mean it like
that, I just mean...

35:35.803 --> 35:38.605
You know, it's okay
if things change.

35:38.638 --> 35:42.542
You're not just the sum
of your previous parts.

35:42.576 --> 35:45.679
Start over. I did.

35:47.148 --> 35:49.717
I don't wanna
start over.

35:49.750 --> 35:51.953
I just want
my life back.

35:55.022 --> 35:58.092
Well, what you need is...

35:59.160 --> 36:00.962
a good night's sleep.

36:02.662 --> 36:04.464
I can just crash
on the couch.

36:04.497 --> 36:07.101
Okay, the bed
might not be the biggest,

36:07.134 --> 36:09.036
but it will definitely
fit two.

36:10.604 --> 36:12.572
Don't really sleep
much anyway.

36:26.821 --> 36:28.622
You want another drink?

36:31.458 --> 36:32.894
Sam?

37:35.689 --> 37:37.959
Do you think
you can love another woman?

37:37.992 --> 37:39.827
When, now?

37:39.860 --> 37:41.594
No, ever.

37:41.628 --> 37:43.264
No, not if I
have you.

37:43.297 --> 37:45.598
You're one
in a million.

37:45.632 --> 37:48.635
Sam, there are three billion
other women out there.

37:48.668 --> 37:51.604
That means that there are
three thousand other women

37:51.638 --> 37:53.673
you could potentially
fall in love with.

37:53.708 --> 37:56.110
That's a lot
of competition.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.845
How would I
find them?

37:57.878 --> 38:00.680
You'll just start wandering
around, looking.

38:00.715 --> 38:02.984
No, I won't, because I have you.

38:03.017 --> 38:06.686
- Why me?
- I like your eyes.

38:10.157 --> 38:12.259
<i>What if I
were dead?</i>

38:49.296 --> 38:51.664
Can't say "fuck it,"
can you?

38:55.336 --> 38:56.871
No.

39:23.964 --> 39:24.965
Sam!

39:26.367 --> 39:28.635
What the fuck
are you doing?

39:29.837 --> 39:30.971
I gotta find her.

39:32.273 --> 39:34.208
How are you
gonna do that?

39:35.675 --> 39:36.811
I don't know.

39:40.414 --> 39:42.582
Ugh, okay.
Hold on.

39:51.325 --> 39:52.692
<i>Hey, Misha.</i>

39:52.726 --> 39:54.829
Hey, Katie.
Who's your friend?

39:54.862 --> 39:56.931
- Oh, he's my new boyfriend.
- Oh!

39:56.964 --> 39:58.365
Well, not yet,
but I'm working on it.

39:58.399 --> 40:00.101
It's nice to meet you.

40:00.134 --> 40:03.838
Um, did Janet by chance leave
a check for the premiere?

40:03.871 --> 40:07.775
- Yes, she did.
- Thank you. Um...

40:07.808 --> 40:10.077
I'm just gonna leave her
a quick note in her office.

40:10.111 --> 40:12.246
- Is that cool?
- Of course.

40:18.052 --> 40:21.021
Here she is.
Lauren... Clerk.

40:21.055 --> 40:24.425
It shows Vince MacDonald,
cinematographer.

40:24.458 --> 40:26.360
I guess they live
together.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.265
You know, if this was
so easy,

40:31.298 --> 40:33.834
why didn't we look her
up when we first met?

40:33.868 --> 40:35.336
I thought you were
a psychopath.

40:35.369 --> 40:38.105
No, after that.

40:38.139 --> 40:40.908
Stalker, but still
probably true.

40:40.941 --> 40:42.843
So why are you
helping me now?

40:44.044 --> 40:45.346
Because you rejected me

40:45.379 --> 40:48.082
and I'm just sick enough
to be attracted by that.

40:50.451 --> 40:54.054
You wanna know my opinion,
personal interest aside?

40:54.088 --> 40:55.723
Probably not.

40:55.756 --> 40:58.225
Love exists in a
time and a place.

40:58.259 --> 41:00.327
I mean, everybody
thinks it's about fate,

41:00.361 --> 41:03.164
but it's not.
It's about timing.

41:03.197 --> 41:07.001
Even if she is your Georgia,
it's been three years.

41:07.034 --> 41:08.936
You're a different person.

41:08.969 --> 41:11.739
In case you haven't noticed,
she is literally a different person.

41:13.140 --> 41:16.310
Sam, you can only go forward.
Can't go back.

42:22.543 --> 42:24.878
- Where are you going?
- In.

42:24.912 --> 42:28.148
We're stalking,
not breaking and entering.

42:28.182 --> 42:30.784
- So we're just gonna wait.
- No.

42:30.818 --> 42:34.154
We're staking out
the place. It's different.

42:34.188 --> 42:36.190
You've done this before.

42:36.223 --> 42:39.193
You're not the only one who's
been through fucked up shit.

42:44.531 --> 42:47.401
Turkey
or pastrami?

42:47.434 --> 42:49.069
Pastrami.

42:49.103 --> 42:51.171
Turkey.

43:46.093 --> 43:47.227
Speed up.
You're losing them.

43:47.261 --> 43:50.130
I'm not losing him.
He's right there.

43:53.067 --> 43:55.035
Make the light.
Make the light!

43:55.069 --> 43:57.171
Oh, my God, just let me
drive, okay?

44:25.032 --> 44:26.333
- Sam.
- What?

44:26.367 --> 44:29.036
You just look intense,
okay?

44:29.069 --> 44:32.206
Try to be subtle.
I'll be at the bar.

44:33.374 --> 44:34.441
Jesus.

44:43.650 --> 44:45.352
You're being ridiculous.
You're gonna have

44:45.386 --> 44:47.087
your birthday dinner
at our house and that's it.

44:47.121 --> 44:49.256
- It's too much work.
- How is it too much?

44:49.289 --> 44:51.058
You can come to our house
for dinner.

44:51.091 --> 44:52.593
- Lauren loves to cook.
- I do. I really do.

44:52.626 --> 44:54.561
Honey, she
is amazing...

44:54.595 --> 44:58.565
- And I set a mean table.
- You sure do, baby.

45:00.667 --> 45:02.936
- I don't want you to leave tonight.
- Oh, no.

45:02.970 --> 45:07.608
Um, I have to shoot off to San
Francisco for a commercial.

45:07.641 --> 45:09.209
And you can't live without
me, can you, baby?

45:09.243 --> 45:11.078
Mm-mm.

45:34.134 --> 45:35.969
Excuse me
just a second.

45:36.003 --> 45:38.505
- Want another drink, babe?
- Yes, please.

45:57.024 --> 45:59.126
Hi.

45:59.159 --> 46:01.061
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is the ladies' room.

46:01.094 --> 46:04.031
No, I know. It's just
you look like someone.

46:06.801 --> 46:08.703
Are you Georgia?

46:08.736 --> 46:12.239
Uh, no,
I'm not Georgia.

46:15.075 --> 46:16.711
If you don't leave,
I'll scream,

46:16.744 --> 46:19.613
and my fiancé will come beat the
living shit out of you, so...

46:19.646 --> 46:22.015
Just give me
one minute, okay?

46:22.049 --> 46:25.052
I flew all the way
over here from Paris.

46:25.085 --> 46:28.355
I'm staying at the shitty
La Cienega Hotel.

46:28.388 --> 46:30.457
I just have to know
if it's you.

46:30.491 --> 46:32.226
I don't know
who you're talking about...

46:32.259 --> 46:33.795
You're wearing
the necklace I gave you.

46:33.828 --> 46:37.431
Georgia, it's me.
It's Sam.

46:37.464 --> 46:40.802
I-I gave me the
necklace I'm wearing.

46:40.835 --> 46:43.070
No. You're lying.

46:43.103 --> 46:46.240
I gave it to you four years
ago on our anniversary.

46:46.273 --> 46:50.310
If you really don't know me,
why aren't you leaving?

46:50.344 --> 46:51.746
- Georgia, just give me a minute...
- All right!

46:54.214 --> 46:57.150
I don't know
who the fuck you are.

46:57.184 --> 46:58.720
I'm gonna walk out of
that door and leave,

46:58.753 --> 47:00.521
and if I ever see you again,
I'm calling the cops.

47:00.554 --> 47:02.256
Do you understand me?

47:09.296 --> 47:10.497
Oh, my God!

47:24.545 --> 47:27.381
Hey, sorry
to interrupt the party,

47:27.414 --> 47:29.851
but do you mind if we head home?
I'm just not feeling very well.

47:29.884 --> 47:32.219
- Yeah, baby.
- I don't know.

48:01.281 --> 48:02.750
It's not her.

48:04.852 --> 48:06.353
I know.

48:10.691 --> 48:12.192
Do you wanna
get out of here?

48:12.225 --> 48:14.428
Just give me a
minute, all right?

48:15.897 --> 48:19.099
Okay. I'll wait
for you outside.

48:31.311 --> 48:33.313
I need to close my tab.

48:37.551 --> 48:39.386
Do I know you?

48:47.461 --> 48:49.363
I don't think so.

48:49.396 --> 48:52.499
No. I know you.

48:53.567 --> 48:54.869
You're the guy.

48:56.236 --> 48:57.537
I'm the guy.

48:57.571 --> 49:00.742
Oh, shit!

49:20.327 --> 49:22.562
Now we know
who you are, fucker!

49:22.596 --> 49:24.197
Come here, come here.

49:40.848 --> 49:42.884
- Is he coming?
- No, I don't see him.

49:42.917 --> 49:44.986
My God, what the fuck
did you do?!

49:45.019 --> 49:46.420
I didn't do anything.

49:46.453 --> 49:49.389
Fuck, Sam! I just
electrocuted someone.

49:50.992 --> 49:53.226
Let me see the wallet.

49:59.734 --> 50:01.936
- What?
- Oh, shit.

50:01.969 --> 50:05.472
Okay, you need to tell me
what the fuck is going on.

50:11.045 --> 50:14.648
- I mean, Jesus Christ, Sam!
- What was I gonna say?

50:16.017 --> 50:17.284
I'm accused of murder?

50:18.920 --> 50:22.422
<i>I'm on a mob hit list?</i>

50:22.456 --> 50:24.391
<i>I already sound crazy.</i>

50:26.761 --> 50:28.996
- How do you think they found you?
- I have no clue.

50:29.030 --> 50:32.599
I just know it's over.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

50:33.868 --> 50:35.535
- Why?
- I scared the shit

50:35.569 --> 50:37.370
out of some random girl
in a bathroom.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.640
Now they've found me...

50:42.642 --> 50:43.911
Where are you
gonna go?

50:43.945 --> 50:45.645
Not Paris.

50:45.679 --> 50:47.849
I don't know,
somewhere warm?

50:47.882 --> 50:50.484
Mexico, maybe?

50:57.759 --> 50:58.993
Let's do it.

51:01.461 --> 51:04.799
What? I need a vacation.
Especially after this shit.

51:07.769 --> 51:11.304
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

51:14.574 --> 51:16.576
Fuck it.

51:18.578 --> 51:21.849
Okay.

51:22.850 --> 51:25.720
I'll... get us tickets

51:25.753 --> 51:28.388
and pick you up
first thing in the morning.

51:33.460 --> 51:35.730
Oh!

51:37.098 --> 51:39.000
Keep the stunner.

51:39.033 --> 51:41.434
Okay? I've my gun at home.

51:57.819 --> 51:59.553
Fuck it.

52:07.561 --> 52:09.730
How the fuck
did you lose him?

52:09.764 --> 52:12.033
<i>Some girl appeared out
of nowhere and tasered Mikhail.</i>

52:12.066 --> 52:14.902
- A girl?
- <i>Yes.</i>

52:14.936 --> 52:17.004
Tasered Mikhail?

52:17.038 --> 52:19.006
- <i>I know it sounds...</i>
- I don't wanna know.

52:19.040 --> 52:21.508
Karl, we can
handle this.

52:21.541 --> 52:23.410
Yeah. Obviously.

52:23.443 --> 52:25.378
I'm coming out.

52:25.412 --> 52:28.615
To the borough
airport. Now! Fast!

53:48.763 --> 53:50.998
You're a fuckin' asshole!

53:52.599 --> 53:54.168
You just reappear
in the middle of my life

53:54.201 --> 53:56.938
and follow me around
like some kind of lunatic.

53:56.971 --> 53:59.572
- Georgia, I...
- No, that's not my name anymore.

53:59.606 --> 54:02.810
I had to change everything!
I disappeared!

54:02.843 --> 54:04.078
I was terrified
they'd find me,

54:04.111 --> 54:05.545
I was terrified of <i>you!</i>

54:05.578 --> 54:07.014
Yeah, and then I realized

54:07.048 --> 54:08.816
your "friends" weren't
looking for me, were they?

54:08.849 --> 54:10.583
They were looking for you!

54:12.119 --> 54:15.522
- How much did you owe?
- What? I didn't owe anything.

54:15.555 --> 54:17.758
Don't fucking lie to me!
Don't give me that bullshit!

54:17.792 --> 54:19.994
How could you start
gambling again?

54:20.027 --> 54:22.263
- You promised me!
- What? I didn't!

54:22.296 --> 54:25.665
Who were those guys that
showed up in our fuckin' apartment?

54:25.699 --> 54:28.869
We're very sorry to intrude.
Do you mind if we have a little chat?

54:28.903 --> 54:32.572
- Eastern European mafia.
- You were involved in the Mafia? Christ!

54:32.605 --> 54:34.875
I picked up your camera
once, okay?

54:34.909 --> 54:37.244
<i>And I saw the old guy
across the way, that's it.</i>

54:37.278 --> 54:38.879
<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

54:38.913 --> 54:41.248
I saw something that I
wasn't supposed to see.

54:41.282 --> 54:43.616
And they sent those two guys
over to our apartment.

54:45.585 --> 54:47.955
I've been hiding in Paris
ever since.

54:50.992 --> 54:52.760
And you never thought
to tell me this?

54:52.793 --> 54:54.594
I saw him shoot you.

54:54.627 --> 54:55.997
I killed him.
I thought you were dead.

55:08.142 --> 55:10.610
I was trying
to protect you.

55:25.658 --> 55:27.294
I don't know
what to say.

55:29.864 --> 55:31.866
I blamed you every day.

55:33.968 --> 55:35.036
I missed you.

55:37.238 --> 55:40.875
Sam, I have a fiancé.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.248
Why do you still
wear the necklace?

55:50.351 --> 55:53.821
I don't know.
I love him.

55:56.057 --> 55:57.258
I never stopped
thinking about you.

55:57.291 --> 56:00.227
Sam, I got past you.
I've moved on.

56:00.261 --> 56:03.064
I came for you.

56:03.097 --> 56:05.632
Sam, I don't even
know you anymore.

56:05.665 --> 56:09.336
- Georgia...
- It's not my name.

56:09.370 --> 56:11.772
- I'm Lauren.
- That's not true.

56:21.182 --> 56:22.716
Look, do you need, uh...

56:25.419 --> 56:28.789
money or something?

56:33.394 --> 56:34.995
I'm fine.

56:45.739 --> 56:49.810
When I was in Paris, I would go to
Pont Neuf every week and think of you.

58:01.882 --> 58:04.351
<i>I wish we could stay
like this forever.</i>

58:05.519 --> 58:07.087
I don't even need
to feel you,

58:07.121 --> 58:09.790
touch you, smell you.
Nothing.

58:16.797 --> 58:20.301
As long as you feel
the way you do about me.

58:30.344 --> 58:32.112
<i>I can't believe
you came back for me.</i>

58:42.223 --> 58:44.158
It was all really fast.

59:05.346 --> 59:06.981
<i>I didn't have my phone,</i>

59:07.014 --> 59:09.917
<i>so the only number I knew
was my Mom's.</i>

59:09.950 --> 59:12.152
<i>I was freaked out,
so I took a train to Ohio.</i>

59:12.186 --> 59:14.021
<i>When I got there,
I tried to reach you,</i>

59:14.054 --> 59:17.524
<i>but your phone and Facebook
and email were all deactivated.</i>

59:17.558 --> 59:21.228
I figured you owed a lot.

59:23.063 --> 59:24.498
And I had seen
those guys' faces.

59:28.902 --> 59:32.806
But the newspapers said there
were unidentifiable bodies.

59:39.046 --> 59:41.849
I figured I could
be one...

59:43.117 --> 59:45.252
so I dropped
who I was and vanished.

59:46.920 --> 59:49.823
Only my Mom knows.

01:00:07.374 --> 01:00:09.376
I'm gonna
make it up to you.

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.945
For what?

01:00:11.979 --> 01:00:15.182
For all the time...

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:19.086
for everything you lost,
for blaming you.

01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:21.121
It wasn't your fault.

01:00:25.659 --> 01:00:27.428
What's up with this?

01:00:27.461 --> 01:00:29.363
What, you don't like?

01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:32.399
What?

01:00:37.304 --> 01:00:39.106
I never take it off.

01:00:44.345 --> 01:00:46.613
It's the only thing
I have left from those days.

01:00:48.515 --> 01:00:52.453
Happy memories.

01:01:10.204 --> 01:01:12.573
Why are you covering up?
You used to love to show off.

01:01:12.606 --> 01:01:15.209
I'm cold.

01:01:18.278 --> 01:01:21.415
I haven't been
this way in a long time.

01:01:37.631 --> 01:01:40.134
Thanks, sir. Enjoy your stay.

01:01:50.177 --> 01:01:51.345
Karl.

01:01:55.649 --> 01:01:58.986
Jumpy. I recommend
Klonopin.

01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:02.022
A nice anti-anxiety pill
would go a long way with you.

01:02:02.055 --> 01:02:04.958
If I ever want
your advice, Bill,

01:02:04.992 --> 01:02:07.060
I will definitely
call you.

01:02:07.094 --> 01:02:08.562
You fuckin' weirdo!

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:11.698
How did you know
I was coming, eh?

01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:14.401
Coffee?

01:02:14.435 --> 01:02:16.136
What do you want?

01:02:17.638 --> 01:02:19.440
We need to get
our procedure straight.

01:02:21.275 --> 01:02:23.010
I was just about
to cure the patient

01:02:23.043 --> 01:02:24.645
when your nurses
came stumbling in the way.

01:02:24.678 --> 01:02:26.413
Back off.

01:02:26.447 --> 01:02:29.683
The guy murdered my brother.
You've taken way too long.

01:02:29.717 --> 01:02:33.153
Your uninformed opinion
is duly noted.

01:02:33.187 --> 01:02:35.255
However, your nurses wouldn't
even have a starting point

01:02:35.289 --> 01:02:37.491
if I hadn't found
his Lauren Clerk obsession.

01:02:37.524 --> 01:02:40.160
A good surgeon
cuts out the bad

01:02:40.194 --> 01:02:42.329
and leaves everything
else unharmed.

01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:45.199
No mess, no infection.

01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:47.034
No dead brothers
to clean up.

01:02:47.067 --> 01:02:50.103
- Ivan said...
- I don't care what Ivan said.

01:02:50.137 --> 01:02:51.739
Fine.

01:02:51.773 --> 01:02:53.741
But when I'm in surgery,

01:02:53.775 --> 01:02:56.210
your place is
in the waiting room.

01:02:56.243 --> 01:02:58.378
Will you please...

01:02:58.412 --> 01:03:02.516
cut the fake doctor shit
and fake cop shit?

01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:06.386
You wanna take care
of the job?

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.522
Please, Bill.
Take care of it.

01:03:09.556 --> 01:03:11.225
Just so we understand.

01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:15.797
I only take assignments
from the head physician.

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:20.367
Uh-huh. And just
so you understand,

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.337
Ivan is not gonna be
around much longer.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.808
So finish the job.

01:03:26.841 --> 01:03:29.376
Collect the check.

01:03:29.409 --> 01:03:31.512
And I never want
to see you again.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.348
Understood?

01:03:41.688 --> 01:03:43.457
And hey, Bill.

01:03:45.592 --> 01:03:48.362
If you ever talk shit
about my brother again...

01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:53.033
I'll feed you
your own balls.

01:04:04.444 --> 01:04:06.547
Alex! Alex!

01:04:30.203 --> 01:04:31.471
Hey, what are you doing?

01:04:32.874 --> 01:04:34.675
Hey.

01:04:34.709 --> 01:04:37.812
Go back to sleep.

01:04:40.882 --> 01:04:43.383
Hmm...

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:48.155
I wanna be packed and out of
the house before he gets back.

01:04:49.489 --> 01:04:50.691
I know it's wrong,
but I really...

01:04:50.725 --> 01:04:53.728
- I can't do it in person.
- Okay.

01:04:53.761 --> 01:04:55.797
Meet me at the house
at 7:00?

01:04:57.899 --> 01:05:01.101
- I left the address on the table.
- Okay.

01:05:04.471 --> 01:05:06.573
I'm really happy
we're back.

01:05:07.608 --> 01:05:09.643
Me too.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.515
- Get some sleep, okay?
- All right.

01:05:47.447 --> 01:05:50.217
- Got you a coffee.
- Thanks.

01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:56.289
Kat, there's been
a change.

01:05:56.323 --> 01:05:58.291
I know, I saw her.

01:06:01.461 --> 01:06:03.563
You weren't crazy.

01:06:03.597 --> 01:06:06.266
No, I wasn't.

01:06:09.336 --> 01:06:10.805
I've one more favor
to ask.

01:06:14.508 --> 01:06:18.311
This is the one time
when you don't say "fuck it."

01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:20.547
She was safe,
and now she's not.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.884
- And that's because of me.
- So just take her and run.

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:24.986
If they found me here,
they'll find us anywhere.

01:06:25.019 --> 01:06:29.189
This is
so fucking dumb!

01:06:33.995 --> 01:06:36.530
Sam, don't be
an idiot.

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:37.859
I'm here to see
Mr. Demisovski

01:07:45.365 --> 01:07:47.534
I don't have you
on the schedule, Dr...?

01:07:47.567 --> 01:07:49.070
Dr. Randall.

01:07:49.103 --> 01:07:51.706
Dr. Sanjay, he asked me
if I would look in for him.

01:07:53.607 --> 01:07:56.676
I'm early. It's the only time
I could fit him in today.

01:08:02.784 --> 01:08:05.352
No more bad news,
Doctor.

01:08:06.788 --> 01:08:08.355
Do you know
who I am?

01:08:12.459 --> 01:08:14.962
- A new doctor?
- No.

01:08:15.997 --> 01:08:18.765
New York?
Three years ago?

01:08:19.767 --> 01:08:21.868
I saw you
in an apartment.

01:08:21.903 --> 01:08:24.571
And you sent the Ristani
brothers to kill me.

01:08:29.442 --> 01:08:31.377
That woman I killed...

01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:34.481
I strangled her
with my bare hands...

01:08:34.514 --> 01:08:37.684
<i>till she couldn't
breathe anymore.</i>

01:08:38.886 --> 01:08:41.621
<i>Because she had
an affair.</i>

01:08:43.124 --> 01:08:44.926
<i>Because...</i>

01:08:44.959 --> 01:08:47.460
I thought she was mine.

01:08:47.493 --> 01:08:52.566
Hm. And now
it means nothing.

01:08:53.633 --> 01:08:55.770
Nothing at all.

01:08:55.803 --> 01:08:59.573
You haven't seen or heard
from me in three years.

01:08:59.606 --> 01:09:02.076
I just want
my life back.

01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:07.982
I cannot
turn back the time.

01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:16.622
Call this thing off.

01:09:16.656 --> 01:09:18.091
You threatening me?

01:09:19.926 --> 01:09:22.930
- I have cancer.
- Call it off.

01:09:22.964 --> 01:09:24.464
Or I'll make it
my life's mission

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:27.667
to kill every person
you have ever loved.

01:09:27.702 --> 01:09:32.106
I haven't loved anyone
since I was 20 years old.

01:09:32.139 --> 01:09:36.777
They took me from Yuliana,
sent me to the gulag.

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:39.846
The first night I was in there,

01:09:39.881 --> 01:09:42.415
someone tried
to steal my food.

01:09:42.448 --> 01:09:46.519
So I killed him
with a rock.

01:09:49.223 --> 01:09:52.459
Me, an accountant.

01:09:53.593 --> 01:09:55.495
Love is a luxury.

01:09:55.528 --> 01:09:58.698
In the end,
it doesn't mean anything.

01:09:58.733 --> 01:10:02.937
In the end,
you are with God.

01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:04.972
Alone.

01:10:06.107 --> 01:10:09.944
Why is He so clearly
important to me

01:10:09.977 --> 01:10:13.613
- when He wasn't there?
- Because you're fucking dying!

01:10:13.647 --> 01:10:16.449
What do you know
about death?

01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:18.920
You're too young,
even to smell it.

01:10:20.721 --> 01:10:23.024
I haven't been alive since the
day I saw you out that window.

01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:27.728
Then we're the same.
In Purgatory.

01:10:27.762 --> 01:10:29.629
No. This is
on your shoulders.

01:10:29.663 --> 01:10:31.631
You killed
Karl's brother.

01:10:31.665 --> 01:10:35.202
- That's between Karl and you.
- I was defending myself.

01:10:35.236 --> 01:10:38.973
You sent them.
His brother's death is on your soul.

01:10:39.006 --> 01:10:40.841
And mine will be too.

01:11:06.566 --> 01:11:08.235
We're good.

01:12:56.243 --> 01:12:58.813
Holy shit!

01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:11.392
- Surgery.
- <i>Bill? Call it off.</i>

01:13:11.425 --> 01:13:14.195
<i>But I was just about to operate
on one of your patients.</i>

01:13:14.228 --> 01:13:16.931
No surgery.
Let them go.

01:13:16.964 --> 01:13:19.767
- Understood.
- <i>Is that my brother's killer?</i>

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.634
Karl, if you are
where I am...

01:13:21.668 --> 01:13:23.137
Bill! Bill!

01:13:25.206 --> 01:13:27.174
Finish the job.

01:13:29.243 --> 01:13:32.612
- I work for Ivan.
- <i>Bill! Bill...</i>

01:13:39.386 --> 01:13:41.388
You have
Ivan's blessings.

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.932
What the fuck?

01:13:55.769 --> 01:13:57.004
You can't take this
from me.

01:13:58.272 --> 01:14:01.674
You don't tell <i>me</i>
what to do.

01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:03.277
You do what I say!

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:06.113
Fuck that!

01:14:06.147 --> 01:14:08.282
I paid my dues.

01:14:08.315 --> 01:14:11.785
- You owe me!
- I owe you nothing.

01:14:11.819 --> 01:14:15.655
I brought you in.
You owe me and that's the end of it.

01:14:40.414 --> 01:14:42.183
Surprise!

01:14:42.216 --> 01:14:44.785
- Hey, baby. Look how cute I am.
- Hi.

01:14:44.818 --> 01:14:46.954
Well! Oh!

01:14:49.089 --> 01:14:51.125
What's wrong?

01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:54.428
Oh, nothing! I just wasn't
expecting, um, flowers.

01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:57.932
- You're back early.
- Yeah, yeah. They pushed the commercial.

01:14:57.965 --> 01:14:59.800
What's all this?

01:15:01.468 --> 01:15:03.404
Wait a minute, did you get it?
Did you get the movie?

01:15:03.437 --> 01:15:05.472
- Babe, clink, clink! This is awesome!
- Oh!

01:15:05.506 --> 01:15:07.508
Well done!

01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:12.179
- Thanks.
- Wait, you're not excited?

01:15:12.213 --> 01:15:16.450
No, no, I am, I'm just
a little... nervous.

01:15:16.483 --> 01:15:18.786
Alright, well don't worry about it.
I'll be there with you.

01:15:18.819 --> 01:15:20.387
Oh, no, you've gotta
shoot next week.

01:15:20.421 --> 01:15:22.790
Well, so what? I'll cancel that.
Babe, you're more important.

01:15:22.823 --> 01:15:24.158
This is a big deal.

01:15:25.259 --> 01:15:26.760
No, you can't. Um...

01:15:28.429 --> 01:15:30.164
I didn't get the part.

01:15:33.234 --> 01:15:36.904
It's okay. There'll be others.
All right?

01:15:38.906 --> 01:15:40.140
I have to leave.

01:15:41.542 --> 01:15:43.410
You <i>have</i> to leave?
What do you mean?

01:15:45.846 --> 01:15:48.382
There's so much about me
that you don't know.

01:15:50.851 --> 01:15:53.020
All right, you...

01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:55.756
You're freaking me out a little bit.
What's... what are you talking about?

01:15:57.424 --> 01:15:59.059
I can't explain it.

01:16:00.494 --> 01:16:02.129
Lauren...

01:16:02.162 --> 01:16:03.330
Lauren, talk to me.

01:16:03.364 --> 01:16:05.866
My name isn't Lauren.

01:16:13.173 --> 01:16:15.476
What are you
talking about?

01:16:15.509 --> 01:16:21.282
I was involved...
in something... terrible...

01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:24.418
before I met you.

01:16:26.587 --> 01:16:29.223
Okay. Um...

01:16:32.426 --> 01:16:37.398
Okay. Well, I...
I don't care.

01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:40.067
And whatever it is,
we'll work it out together,

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.404
because that's what we do, right?
We'll work it out together.

01:16:43.437 --> 01:16:46.206
Please, just let me go.
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.576
The only way you can hurt me is
by not telling me what's going on.

01:16:50.911 --> 01:16:53.013
Vince...

01:16:53.047 --> 01:16:55.316
Vince, you're wonderful.

01:16:55.349 --> 01:16:57.951
You're the perfect guy for me.

01:17:02.122 --> 01:17:04.958
But I'm in love
with someone else.

01:17:19.506 --> 01:17:22.409
Think this is where
three becomes a crowd.

01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:27.047
- Kat...
- You don't need to say anything.

01:17:29.116 --> 01:17:30.984
If we've met
at a different point...

01:17:31.018 --> 01:17:33.620
Yeah, it would've
been great.

01:17:48.001 --> 01:17:49.436
See you.

01:18:10.124 --> 01:18:12.526
- Wait, um...
- I'll get it.

01:18:12.559 --> 01:18:13.627
Please, I just...

01:18:17.231 --> 01:18:20.033
You must be Sam.

01:18:21.568 --> 01:18:24.271
I just need to grab
one thing.

01:19:02.342 --> 01:19:04.578
Where the fuck are we?

01:19:10.284 --> 01:19:11.452
<i>Fuck that!</i>

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.987
<i>You owe me.</i>

01:19:26.467 --> 01:19:28.101
Just, um...

01:19:35.175 --> 01:19:37.211
Just be what she's
hoping you'll be.

01:19:37.644 --> 01:19:38.713
Yeah.

01:19:39.781 --> 01:19:41.582
'Cause she's great.

01:19:44.117 --> 01:19:47.254
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna...

01:19:47.287 --> 01:19:49.523
I'm gonna go drink myself
into an unhealthy stupor.

01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:55.362
What the fuck is that?

01:20:00.667 --> 01:20:02.669
Who the fuck are you and what
are you doing in my house?

01:20:02.704 --> 01:20:05.072
Shut up and listen.
They're coming.

01:20:05.105 --> 01:20:08.175
- Shit! You're bleeding!
- Who-who's coming?

01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:11.178
The guy from the bar. I saw them.
They're on their way.

01:20:11.211 --> 01:20:12.646
Can someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:16.283
- I'll get it!
- Don't let her open the door.

01:20:25.392 --> 01:20:26.995
Hey, get in the closet.

01:22:22.542 --> 01:22:24.444
Hey! Hey, hey!
Look at me, look at me.

01:22:24.478 --> 01:22:26.680
Look at me. I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

01:22:26.714 --> 01:22:28.649
Listen to me. I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

01:22:28.682 --> 01:22:30.584
We're gonna be okay. Okay?

01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:33.788
Okay?

01:22:33.821 --> 01:22:37.224
- Hmm.
- All right. Hold my hand.

01:22:37.257 --> 01:22:38.692
We're gonna run.

01:23:01.816 --> 01:23:03.517
Are you okay?

01:23:10.992 --> 01:23:12.492
Come close to me.

01:23:29.043 --> 01:23:30.712
Go! Go!

01:23:42.023 --> 01:23:44.458
You are the girl.

01:23:44.491 --> 01:23:45.893
You didn't die.

01:24:15.489 --> 01:24:17.657
Oh, my God.

01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:19.787
<i>"Gilles,
it's been a while.</i>

01:25:21.555 --> 01:25:23.390
<i>Never made it to Bali,</i>

01:25:23.423 --> 01:25:25.525
<i>Mexico's just as warm.</i>

01:25:25.559 --> 01:25:28.428
<i>If you happen to get out
of Paris, come visit me.</i>

01:25:28.461 --> 01:25:29.897
<i>There's no Frenchmen here.</i>

01:25:31.665 --> 01:25:34.367
<i>I found the girl
I was looking for.</i>

01:25:34.401 --> 01:25:35.870
<i>Had to travel across the world
to realize</i>

01:25:35.903 --> 01:25:38.572
<i>I'm not the same person I was.</i>

01:25:38.605 --> 01:25:40.373
<i>Neither is she.</i>

01:25:40.407 --> 01:25:42.076
<i>And we never will be.</i>

01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:44.111
<i>And that's okay.</i>

01:25:44.145 --> 01:25:46.948
<i>Because New Year's is coming,</i>

01:25:46.981 --> 01:25:49.516
<i>and like you once told me,</i>

01:25:49.549 --> 01:25:51.618
<i>'It's a good time
to start over.'</i>

01:25:51.651 --> 01:25:54.722
Ton frère, <i>Sam."</i>
