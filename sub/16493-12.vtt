You know, no matter how many

I'm always surprised how much fun
you can have with rendered pig fat.

Guys,
I think you know and I know,

00:54.623 --> 00:59.039
that it's time we went on the
scariest lard-based ride...

You know thunder's a sound,
how can it be greased?

01:10.540 --> 01:11.998
The same way you
grease lightning.

01:12.081 --> 01:13.373
With lard.

01:13.456 --> 01:14.582
Right, Melissa?

Melissa?

Melissa, Melissa, Melissa.

Would you cut it out?

01:22.832 --> 01:23.832
It's nothing, okay?

01:23.914 --> 01:26.456
Okay,
it just seems like you're...

01:26.540 --> 01:28.707
Losing it big time? Yeah! That!

01:28.790 --> 01:30.665
I wouldn't want you two
to think any less of me.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.248
You can tell us, Melissa.

01:32.331 --> 01:33.415
You're in the trust circle.

01:33.498 --> 01:34.498
Well, there's three of us.

01:34.582 --> 01:36.081
So, it's a trust triangle.

You know what? Let's just not.

01:42.832 --> 01:44.373
[Melissa] Okay, I'll tell you.

01:44.456 --> 01:46.748
I'm afraid of...

01:47.582 --> 01:49.498
Rollercoasters.

01:49.582 --> 01:51.790
Okay, that's actually
a pretty normal thing.

01:51.873 --> 01:52.914
But how can you

01:52.998 --> 01:54.206
be afraid of rollercoasters?

01:54.290 --> 01:55.623
I've seen you walk a tightrope

02:04.582 --> 02:06.456
I'd just finished assembling
a cool science project

02:06.540 --> 02:07.540

02:14.540 --> 02:16.373
I used to love rollercoasters,

02:16.456 --> 02:19.790
but I didn't know they could drop
from the sky and crush your dreams!

02:19.873 --> 02:22.665
Why were you assembling a science
project on the first day of...

02:22.748 --> 02:24.164
Melissa, you understand

02:24.248 --> 02:26.582
that the chances of that
happening again are, like,

02:26.665 --> 02:28.707
even less than it
happening the first time.

02:28.790 --> 02:30.498
Lightning never strikes twice!

02:30.582 --> 02:31.790
Milo's been struck twice.

Both times on my birthday.

-I've got stuff I'm afraid of too.
-Like what?

02:40.873 --> 02:42.540
It was three years ago...

02:42.623 --> 02:45.290
My parents and I took a pontoon
up the Saskatchewan River.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.331
I was going to the worst
place in the world.

02:47.415 --> 02:48.914
And I didn't even know it yet.

03:02.456 --> 03:03.540
[Zack] "Never get
out of the boat."

03:03.623 --> 03:05.373
Absolutely right.

03:05.456 --> 03:08.373
You know, Chinese finger
traps still terrify me.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.623
How long has that
been on your finger?

03:09.707 --> 03:10.582

03:14.956 --> 03:17.873
Milo! You're not supposed
to get out of the donut.

03:17.956 --> 03:20.914
[Zack] Never get out of the donut.
Absolutely right.

03:22.914 --> 03:23.873
Here you go,

03:23.956 --> 03:25.582
one bag of pistachios.

03:25.665 --> 03:26.707
You'll have to
shell them yourself,

03:26.790 --> 03:28.832
which makes it a perfect
theme-park snack.

03:28.914 --> 03:31.415
Especially for the guy who
has to sweep up around here.

03:31.498 --> 03:32.998
Incidentally, that's also me.

03:33.081 --> 03:34.707
[electric discharge]

03:36.790 --> 03:39.748
Good afternoon, Mr... Henry.

03:39.832 --> 03:42.456
We are inspecting all of the
pistachio stands in the area

03:42.540 --> 03:45.748
to make sure they meet strict
governmental safety guidelines.

03:45.832 --> 03:48.582
For instance,
is this particular stand fireproof?

03:48.665 --> 03:49.873
Uh...

03:49.956 --> 03:53.206
Or can it withstand an
attack by a barnyard animal?

03:53.290 --> 03:54.582
Pig for instance?

03:54.665 --> 03:56.331
Or both,
what if a flaming pig attacked?

03:56.415 --> 04:00.623
Yes! Could this cart withstand
the onslaught of a flaming pig.

04:00.707 --> 04:01.873
Hmm? I don't think so!

04:01.956 --> 04:03.582
I do not think so.

04:03.665 --> 04:06.081
You're not serious.
There's no way a flaming pig...

04:06.164 --> 04:08.748
Listen, kid. Corporate sent
us to protect these nuts.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.790
So back off and let us do our
job, okay?

04:11.873 --> 04:13.623
I didn't even know
there was a corporate.

04:13.707 --> 04:14.790
[whispering] There's always a corporate.

Come on, Melissa.

-Face your fear.
-We could help.

drop, and gut-wrenching loop.

04:25.248 --> 04:26.456
[muffled] Okay, look.

If you do it, Melissa,
I'll face my fear too.

04:30.707 --> 04:31.914
Really?

04:31.998 --> 04:33.998
Okay. We'll both face our fears.

04:34.081 --> 04:35.081
What about Zack, though?

04:35.164 --> 04:36.456
Zack, you're off the hook

04:36.540 --> 04:38.248
due to a general lack
of fish in the area.

04:38.331 --> 04:40.456
Right, a shame I can't
face my fear, too.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.248
-Yes!
-[Melissa] I saw that!

04:43.331 --> 04:44.456

looking at the ride.

You know, this is a lot
of work for one person.

05:07.623 --> 05:08.832
Could you do something?

05:08.914 --> 05:11.956
I could. And I am.
I'm eating pistachios.

can we go home now?

Negative, the window of
probability is still open.

to practice the theremin.

The fact that you're willing to face
your fear is a tribute to your character.

06:04.998 --> 06:08.707
You are the embodiment of
strength, of will...

06:08.790 --> 06:10.748
And an inspiration to everyone.

06:10.832 --> 06:13.748
Your intestinal fortitude
is truly impressive.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.623
Milo's right.
We're both proud of you, Melissa.

06:16.707 --> 06:18.748
You're like the Joan
of Arc of theme parks.

06:18.832 --> 06:20.707
Wasn't Joan of Arc
burned at the stake?

06:20.790 --> 06:21.707
She was!

06:21.790 --> 06:23.540
She wasn't afraid of
rollercoasters, though.

06:23.623 --> 06:24.790
She was not.

06:24.873 --> 06:27.623
Oh, okay.
I guess that's reassuring.

06:27.707 --> 06:29.623
[Milo] Just relax
and enjoy the ride!

06:29.707 --> 06:31.248
Yeah, safe, yeah. We'll be safe.

06:31.331 --> 06:32.914
I mean,
what could possibly go wrong?

06:32.998 --> 06:35.373
Hey look!
The safety railing came loose.

-Zack! We're on a rollerocaster with Milo!
-Huh?

06:39.206 --> 06:43.081
I said...
We're on a rollercoaster with...

06:43.164 --> 06:45.582
See this?
This is what freaks me out.

06:45.665 --> 06:47.748
You're right Melissa,
this was a bad idea.

06:47.832 --> 06:51.123
-I don't know what I was...
-[splashes]

06:51.206 --> 06:53.665
Maybe I shouldn't be
here when she gets back.

06:53.748 --> 06:54.748
Don't worry, Melissa.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.623
If I can do it, you can do it.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.081
I mean, Zack's right,
it's perfectly safe!

06:59.164 --> 07:01.748
Or as safe as can be
expected, given the height,

07:01.832 --> 07:03.914
and the speed and Murphy's Law.

07:03.998 --> 07:05.206
I'll stop talking now.

Mea culpa. So sorry.

I know facing your fears is
scary, Milo,

08:22.914 --> 08:25.248
but right now,
I need your fear to face mine.

08:27.914 --> 08:28.790
Ah! It worked.

08:30.873 --> 08:32.873
Oh, thank goodness that's over.

08:32.956 --> 08:35.039
I don't know, Melissa,
this looks like the beginning of the ride.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.998
Look, see there's the
top of that plane again.

08:37.415 --> 08:39.623
Hi, plane!

08:39.707 --> 08:42.998
We're going through
that same thing again?

08:43.331 --> 08:46.623
[shatters]

08:46.707 --> 08:48.790
No, I think this time it'll
be a little different.

08:48.873 --> 08:50.039
[Melissa] What's that
supposed to mean?

you're no longer a threat to me.
