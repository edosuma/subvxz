Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.182
Hey.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.483
I got it.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.051
Thank you.
That was a close one.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.422
Looks like we got a lot
done today. Good work.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.756
Let's wrap it up, lock it down.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.492

Oh. Cold.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.355
Mm.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.756
Thirsty.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.525
Wow, nice shorts
there, Rountree.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.526
Those come
in adult sizes?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.628
What did I tell you, Sam?

02:07.728 --> 02:10.097
And what did I tell you
about bringing something to wear

02:10.198 --> 02:11.532
under your wetsuit? Hmm?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.000
Which you didn't, so

02:13.100 --> 02:14.602
you get what's
in the lost and found.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.037
Are these... are these
Deeks's swim trunks?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.806
Relax, Rountree.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.074
I know for a fact those
are not Deeks's shorts.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.109
They're Fatima's.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.212
Ha-ha.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.747
42.5.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.749
That's not bad for your
first open-water mile.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.619
Yeah, wasn't good, either.
Stroke was off.

02:31.719 --> 02:32.920
Maybe it was your shorts.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.455
Thought you were
a good swimmer?

02:34.555 --> 02:35.956
Yeah, I am,

02:36.056 --> 02:38.826
before I bike 12 miles
and run a 5K.

02:39.927 --> 02:40.661
And you,

02:40.761 --> 02:41.862
you're his partner,

02:41.962 --> 02:43.130
why aren't you
training for this?

02:43.231 --> 02:44.732
I wish I could.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.967
I envy you guys,
but, unfortunately,

02:47.067 --> 02:48.369
I got this thing.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.103
What's it called again?
Oh, that's right, um,

02:50.204 --> 02:51.239
common sense.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.174
And he's afraid of sharks.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.443
Really?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.010
There aren't
any sharks out there.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.111
Did he tell you that?

02:58.212 --> 02:59.313
Yeah.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.081
Why don't you ask him

03:01.181 --> 03:02.483
what happened to McMurtry?

03:02.583 --> 03:04.552
What happened to McMurtry?

03:04.652 --> 03:06.754
Nothing happened to McMurtry.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.522
There is no McMurtry.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.358
Not anymore.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.459
Wh...

03:11.559 --> 03:13.461
See you boys
back at the office.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.330
Shame on you, he's just a kid.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.698
Later, shark bait.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.967
Yo, Sam, what happened
to McMurtry?

03:21.335 --> 03:22.803
I'm-a hit the shower.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.544
Whoo!

♪ Sometimes ♪

03:33.113 --> 03:35.816
♪ Sometimes you've got to be

03:35.916 --> 03:37.385
Morning, Deeks.
Oh!

03:37.485 --> 03:38.852
Admiral.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.121
How are you, sir?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.423
Good.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.091
Good to see someone
besides myself

03:44.191 --> 03:46.460
making good use of
the early morning hours.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.297
Indeed I did. Yeah, with,
uh, Kensi and Rosa

03:49.397 --> 03:50.531
away on a school trip,

03:50.631 --> 03:52.132
I was able to dawn patrol
some surfing,

03:52.232 --> 03:54.568
knock out a quick,
yet intense, workout,

03:54.668 --> 03:55.969
and even squeeze in
a little target practice.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.571
Pretty much
my pre-kid routine.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.507
Not that
I'm complaining because

03:59.607 --> 04:01.141
I think that Kensi and I
are really dividing

04:01.241 --> 04:03.611
and conquering
this whole parenting game.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.679
Yes, I can see that.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.080
Actually, there was something

04:07.180 --> 04:09.583
that I wanted
to speak with you about.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.019
I would like to put
your name in the hat

04:12.119 --> 04:13.421
to attend the, uh,

04:13.521 --> 04:15.055
NCIS western conference.

04:15.155 --> 04:18.626
Wow. I mean, I'm-I'm flattered
you would even

04:18.726 --> 04:21.529
think of me. I mean,
you have to admit that

04:21.629 --> 04:22.863
this friendship
has really blossomed...

04:22.963 --> 04:24.432
Okay, maybe this
wasn't such a...

04:24.532 --> 04:25.833
No, no, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.435
I'm sorry.
In all seriousness,

04:27.535 --> 04:29.537
thank you for thinking
of me. I just,

04:29.637 --> 04:30.804
I feel like
I need to stay

04:30.904 --> 04:32.340
as close to home
as possible right now

04:32.440 --> 04:33.607
with everything going on,

04:33.707 --> 04:35.208
but I'm sure one
of the-the younger agents

04:35.309 --> 04:36.477
would love to go to Branson.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.312
You know, maybe-maybe Rountree.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.213
Feel like he would love
a good river cruise.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.750
Well, I will...

04:42.850 --> 04:45.586
be sure to give Agent Rountree
the proper

04:45.686 --> 04:46.920
consideration.
Mm.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.522
Good.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.124
Oh, and by the way, it is not
being held in Branson this year.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.161
Uh, no, they're holding it
in Nosara.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.329
Nosara?

04:55.429 --> 04:56.430
Nosara,

04:56.530 --> 04:57.831
C-Costa Rica?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.400
That would be the one, yeah.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.036
Oh, that's... Well,
you know what, before we...

05:03.136 --> 05:04.938
talk to Rountree,
maybe I should just run it

05:05.038 --> 05:06.640
by Kensi to see
if I could just skip out

05:06.740 --> 05:08.542
for a few days.
A week.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.977
A week...
A week,

05:10.077 --> 05:11.779
and I will need answer
by the end of the day,

05:11.879 --> 05:12.846
so don't dillydally.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.348
No, no, of course not. Don't--

05:14.448 --> 05:16.817
Never dillying or dallying.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.552
Oh...

05:18.652 --> 05:20.721
Man, about time, I'm freezing.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.189
That was a good shower.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.624
Hope there's some
hot water left.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.859
Come on, man.
Oh. We got a case.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.228
Well, wait,
before you log in...

05:28.328 --> 05:30.197
Good morning, Fatima.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.532
Morning.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.133
Where's Deeks?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.268
Oh, trying to get
permission from Kensi

05:35.369 --> 05:36.303
for a boondoggle.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.705
Hmm.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.339
Hey, Sam, uh,
is Rountree still with you?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.908
He is.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.911
Rountree.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.416
Are you wearing
my shorts?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.350
I'm just kidding.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.585
Those are Kensi's.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.087
You know what?
I hate all of you.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.556
What do we got?

05:55.656 --> 05:58.759
A fire at Global West
Ventures Corp,

05:58.859 --> 06:00.461
a Naval defense contractor.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.564
It appears to be arson,
and the FBI believes that

06:03.664 --> 06:05.298
they know who set the fire.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.167
Y'all recognize this?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.204
That looks
eerily familiar.

06:11.304 --> 06:14.808
It's the signature
of a rather infamous arsonist,

06:14.908 --> 06:17.110
Randall Perez, also known as...

06:17.210 --> 06:18.446
"On Alert."

06:18.546 --> 06:20.814
He considered himself
putting his targets

06:20.914 --> 06:22.816
"on alert" for the crimes
they committed.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.984
Did you work
that case?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.285
No, but I remember
him well.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.155
He had the FBI
"on alert" for years.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.524
Is this the same guy
who blew up an oil tanker?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.826
Yeah. Talk about Carmageddon.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.995
He shut down the 405 freeway
for a week.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.531
Any casualties
in this recent fire?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.800
The building
is under renovation,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.602
and the foreman, Michael Duncan,

06:41.702 --> 06:43.170
was found dead inside.

06:43.270 --> 06:47.007
LAPD believes that he actually
caught the arsonist in the act

06:47.107 --> 06:48.909
and was then assaulted

06:49.009 --> 06:50.377
and left for dead
at the scene.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.112
You know, it's one thing
to burn down a building,

06:52.212 --> 06:54.014
it is another
to take a life.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.884
If I remember, Perez's MO
focused on companies

06:56.984 --> 06:59.286
that committed
environmental crimes.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.622
Why would he attack
the defense contractor?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.223
It's unclear.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.293
The company has multiple
highly classified Naval projects

07:06.393 --> 07:08.529
in development on all four
of its campuses.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.531
If there's a vendetta
against this company,

07:10.631 --> 07:12.833
we need to find out
what it is. We need to stop

07:12.933 --> 07:14.768
this arsonist before
he attacks another location

07:14.868 --> 07:15.803
and kills more innocent people.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.170
We're on it.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.806
All right, since Rountree's
already with me,

07:18.906 --> 07:20.140
we'll hit the crime scene.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.309
Actually, Kilbride
wants Agent Rountree

07:22.409 --> 07:25.345
to work with the FBI lead agent
on Perez's task force,

07:25.445 --> 07:26.880
and, Sam, hang tight,

07:26.980 --> 07:29.016
the agent will brief you both
in the boatshed.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.985
And what would Kilbride
have me do?

07:32.085 --> 07:35.188
He wants you to meet him
in his office.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.207
Hey.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.377
Hey, Sam, this is, uh,
FBI Agent Morehurst.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.379
Agent Castor. Sam Hanna.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.648
Pleasure to meet you.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.249
My boss speaks
very highly of you.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.117
However, he did warn me
not to play you in pickleball.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.353
Oh, you must work with Rasheed.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.487
Agent Perkins.
Mm-hmm.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.222
He knows very well
what can happen

08:09.322 --> 08:11.324
when I have a paddle
in my hand.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.160
So...

08:13.260 --> 08:15.062
tell me about Perez.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.497
Well, as a young man,

08:17.598 --> 08:18.699
Perez took
a non-violent,

08:18.799 --> 08:20.568
creative approach
to his activism.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.935
He's a trained
visual artist

08:22.035 --> 08:24.237
and built sculptures
out of plastic straws

08:24.337 --> 08:25.505
found in the ocean.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.474
So, why would
an artist turn into

08:27.575 --> 08:28.776
an environmental terrorist?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.477
Eventually,
he began participating

08:30.578 --> 08:31.812
in more radical protests

08:31.912 --> 08:33.480
and was arrested
numerous times

08:33.581 --> 08:35.916
for disorderly conduct.
When did the fires start?

08:36.016 --> 08:37.618
2017.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.820
It took us a year
to ID Perez as a suspect.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.222
Um, but as we closed in on him,

08:42.322 --> 08:45.125
he went on a spree, setting
nine fires in two months.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.760
So, we can expect another fire?

08:46.860 --> 08:47.895
Very likely.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.163
After his last fire,

08:50.263 --> 08:51.599
we almost caught him.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.133
We believe
he escaped to Mexico

08:53.233 --> 08:55.068
and has been a fugitive
for the last three years.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.436
This is the one that got away?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.038
Proverbially and literally.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.673
Is this the first time
he resurfaced?

08:59.773 --> 09:02.175
Yes, and, this time,
I'm gonna catch him.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.844
You're determined?
Very much.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.980
Yo, Sam, did I leave
my bag out here?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.849
Devin?

09:08.949 --> 09:11.218
Summer.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.720
What are you doing here?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.088
Oh, I take it you two
know each other?

09:15.188 --> 09:17.557
Um, you could say that.
Yeah, you could say that.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.861
Wow. Well,
isn't this a pickle.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.529
A pickle.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.932
Enter.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.870
What's on your mind,
Agent Callen?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.138
I get that Rountree

09:31.238 --> 09:33.974
has a relationship
with FBI. Great.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.576
Team him with the FBI,
but he's a big boy.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.311
Okay? He doesn't need
to be babysat,

09:38.411 --> 09:39.780
especially when he's just
getting briefed.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.449
I'm sorry you miss your bunkie,

09:42.549 --> 09:43.851
but this isn't summer camp.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.186
It's just a waste of time
for Sam.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.857
Sam isn't being partnered
with Rountree today.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.159
He's partnered with Deeks,
poor devil.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.226
And why is that?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.462
Because that's what I wanted.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.198
Don't get me wrong,

09:58.298 --> 10:01.802
it is healthy
to question authority...

10:01.902 --> 10:03.070
on occasion.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.938
But when it gets

10:05.038 --> 10:07.875
to be a regular
pattern of behavior,

10:07.975 --> 10:10.844
quite frankly,
it begins to piss me off.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.480
What is this?

10:13.580 --> 10:16.616
This is everything I could
find on your buddy Pembrook.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.395
Thank you.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.630
It isn't a gift, Agent Callen.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.867
It is my attempt to keep you
focused on the job

10:33.967 --> 10:37.037
and not some ghost
from an unhappy childhood.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.907
Now, you won't
have to be distracted

10:40.007 --> 10:42.710
by your own research,
so knock yourself out.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.778
My personal time
has never impacted

10:44.878 --> 10:46.346
my work here in the office.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.015
Now, if that were
truly the case,

10:48.115 --> 10:50.417
you and I would not be having
this conversation, would we?

10:50.517 --> 10:51.551
I don't...

10:51.651 --> 10:53.320
Quit while you're ahead.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.223
Less talking, more reading.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.125
Consider today your library day,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.427
and, hopefully, you'll
find something in there

11:00.527 --> 11:02.362
that will allow you
to put this to bed

11:02.462 --> 11:05.065
once and for all. Dismissed.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.118
Sam took off?

11:25.218 --> 11:26.419
Yup.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.155
He left a while ago. Oh.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.458
Hey, sorry about my reaction earlier.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.993
It's just, you kind of
caught me off guard.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.129
You want some coffee?
Juice? Uh, milk?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.998
Wait... wait a minute,

11:38.098 --> 11:40.067
you don't think I set
this whole thing up, do you?

11:41.134 --> 11:42.435
I mean...

11:42.535 --> 11:44.905
Well, you-you-you knew
I worked at NCIS, so...

11:45.005 --> 11:47.074
Yeah, but if I wanted
to see you-- which I didn't--

11:47.174 --> 11:48.842
I would've called you.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.610
Oh, but, you know, I-I forgot,

11:50.710 --> 11:52.045
you don't know
how a phone works.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.580
Ooh...

11:53.680 --> 11:55.382
Ouch.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.484
Fair shot.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.922
Can we just start over?

12:02.022 --> 12:04.357
I realize that my opening line
should've been an apology.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.592
Yeah, it's not necessary.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.594
"We" were a long time ago.

12:07.694 --> 12:10.063
Yeah.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.664
Listen, I was...

12:11.765 --> 12:13.366
leaving the Bureau,

12:13.466 --> 12:15.335
my little sister, she was

12:15.435 --> 12:17.604
starting college,

12:17.704 --> 12:19.239
just had a lot on my plate.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.842
Like I said, there's
no need to apologize.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.077
We only dated for,
what, three months?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.247
Oh, damn. Uh... three months?

12:27.347 --> 12:29.817
Uh... Oh, okay. I don't know
if that was an insult

12:29.917 --> 12:31.051
or a compliment or...
No, no, no, I...

12:31.151 --> 12:33.120
Um...
Excuse me.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.022
Hey, Fatima.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.224
Uh, this is Summer.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.259
I mean, Agent Morehurst.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.829
Uh, this is Special Agent
Fatima Namazi.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.164
I-It's nice meeting you,
Agent Namazi.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.099
Nice to meet you as well.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.170
So, I, uh, I did a search
on Perez's family

12:50.270 --> 12:52.172
and his sister
still lives in town.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.341
It's the same house
for the last 20 years.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.576
Denise Perez. She's in Gardena.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.178
Uh...

12:58.278 --> 13:00.313
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
It's nice meeting you.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.316
Hey.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.718
What happened
between you two?

13:05.819 --> 13:07.054
It's a long story.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.021
Can't be that long,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.156
you only dated
three months.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.758
Fatima...

13:11.859 --> 13:15.095
I had my agents look into
the construction company

13:15.195 --> 13:17.297
Global West hired
to do the renovation.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.933
Thought that might be who Perez
had it out for, but, so far,

13:20.033 --> 13:22.802
no environmental red flags, only
a couple of OSHA complaints.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.804
Hmm. All right, well,
if Perez is back in town,

13:24.905 --> 13:26.706
he'll most likely want
to meet up with his sister.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.675
Yeah. He has a daughter as well.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.410
She lives with her aunt, but...

13:30.510 --> 13:32.479
she was only 14
when Perez went on the run.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.114
All right, well,
let's talk to them.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.116
Yeah, yes, of course.
I love you, too.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.251
All right, bye, baby.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.319
So, what did she say?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.922
I didn't bring it up.
Why?

13:42.022 --> 13:45.525
I mean, Kensi is chaperoning
25 16-year-olds

13:45.625 --> 13:47.227
on a field trip
to our nation's capital.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.696
Seems like a little bit
of a selfish time to ask her

13:49.796 --> 13:52.365
if I could go on a surf trip
to Costa Rica.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.602
You do know you have to
attend the conference, right?

13:55.702 --> 13:56.904
Listen,
if I'm in Nosara,

13:57.004 --> 13:58.305
I'm definitely gonna
find time to go surfing.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.508
You sure?
Yes.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.710
Yes, I'm sure.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.113
Just out of curiosity, though,

14:06.213 --> 14:07.915
what would you do with your dad
and everything being here?

14:08.015 --> 14:11.118
I wouldn't go, but, frankly,
I couldn't go if I wanted to.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.819
That's the thing
about being a caregiver,

14:12.920 --> 14:14.955
you have to put other
peoples' needs first.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.190
Mm-hmm.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.458
Right.
Thank you.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.827
Right. Damn it. Right.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.596
He really
did some damage.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.033
Not as much as
he could have.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.436
All of Perez's fires were set
between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.605
If he'd stuck to his usual MO,

14:32.705 --> 14:34.942
Mr. Duncan would be
alive right now.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.746
He could've burned down
this whole complex.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.951
Well, maybe Perez was trying
to send a more subtle message.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.419
Maybe it wasn't Perez.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.289
Global West
is extremely lucky

14:49.389 --> 14:52.359
that the fire was contained
to just this room.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.626
Not to mention

14:53.726 --> 14:55.028
how fast the
fire department got here.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.363
So, you're thinking
it wasn't luck?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.498
I'm thinking we need
to dig deeper

14:58.598 --> 14:59.967
into Global West's financials.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.002
Wouldn't be the first time
a company set a fire

15:02.102 --> 15:03.736
just to collect
the insurance money.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.538
Using Perez's signature

15:05.638 --> 15:08.641
to distract from the real crime.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.410
Maybe.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.047
Crystal, thanks for coming
down and talking to us.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.915
I'm sure this renewed
interest in your father

15:16.016 --> 15:17.284
is taking a toll
on you.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.351
A toll?

15:18.451 --> 15:19.519
Do you have
any idea

15:19.619 --> 15:20.954
what Crystal
has been through?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.623
She's had to change
schools four times.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.758
As soon as someone
found out her father was

15:25.858 --> 15:27.694
"On Alert,"
she would be bullied.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.662
And finally
she's graduated,

15:29.762 --> 15:32.165
has a job she loves,
and is off to college,

15:32.265 --> 15:33.566
and now this.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.303
Ms. Perez, your brother
has caused a lot of harm,

15:36.403 --> 15:38.838
and we want to stop him before
he causes any more damage.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.208
Or takes any more lives.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.276
We just have
a few simple questions.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.081
Are you okay?

15:51.751 --> 15:53.353
Sounds like you have
a great job.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.421
Where do you work?

15:54.521 --> 15:57.790
The Annenberg. I'm a docent.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.792
I want to be a curator
after college.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.094
That's really cool.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.563
Has your father
ever reached out to you?

16:03.663 --> 16:04.597
No.

16:04.697 --> 16:05.665
We haven't seen or heard

16:05.765 --> 16:07.300
from him since he disappeared.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.536
Is that true, Crystal?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.105
Her father is the last thing
we need in our lives.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.640
We don't talk to him.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.176
We don't talk about him.
He's dead to us.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.711
Actually...

16:18.811 --> 16:22.215
that's not exactly true.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.231
Why didn't you
tell me?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.400
He is dangerous.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.135
You wouldn't understand.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.803
Help us understand.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.372
Yeah, what do you
and your father talk about?

16:45.472 --> 16:48.808
Well, he apologizes, mostly.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.610
My mom died
right after I was born,

16:50.710 --> 16:53.012
and he feels bad
that he's not around.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.049
And he's sorry
that he did what he did,

16:56.149 --> 16:58.385
with the fires and everything,

16:58.485 --> 17:00.287
but he felt like...

17:00.387 --> 17:02.021
the world was crumbling
around us,

17:02.122 --> 17:03.223
and he had to do something

17:03.323 --> 17:04.357
to make everyone wake up.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.992
Hmm.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.627
Did he ever give you
any indication

17:07.727 --> 17:09.896
he was trying to get back
in the game?

17:09.996 --> 17:11.231
No.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.599
He even talked about

17:12.699 --> 17:14.467
turning himself in
and serving his time.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.236
Did he tell you where he lives?

17:16.336 --> 17:17.937
No.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.640
When's the last time
you spoke to your father?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.675
About a month ago.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.478
Can you, um...

17:25.578 --> 17:27.847
write down
your cell phone number?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.483
I don't want
to get him in trouble.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.952
Crystal, he's already
in trouble, we just want

17:33.052 --> 17:34.354
to help him.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.688
<i>Deeks.</i>

17:35.788 --> 17:37.457
What do you got, Fatima?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.926
So, I reviewed
Global West's financials,

17:40.026 --> 17:41.594
and they're clean.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.097
As a matter of fact,
they are flush with cash.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.533
They sold off a portion
of the company last year

17:46.633 --> 17:48.401
for a huge profit.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.836
Uh, insurance money

17:49.936 --> 17:51.571
would be a drop in the bucket
at this point.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.174
All right, copy that. Thank you.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.709
So, Fatima couldn't
find any financial motive

17:56.809 --> 17:58.745
for Global West to light
their own building on fire.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.080
What about you, you find
anything in that, uh,

18:01.181 --> 18:02.282
fire inspector report?

18:02.382 --> 18:04.351
It's only preliminary.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.653
Apparently, the arsonist
used thermite

18:06.753 --> 18:08.555
as an accelerant.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.157
It's easy to make
and transport.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.524
So, just like Perez.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.926
Don't forget,
Perez uses his own recipe.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.095
We'll have to wait
for the final arson report

18:16.196 --> 18:17.597
to see if they match.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.566
Fortunately,
none of the unique ingredients

18:19.666 --> 18:20.733
have been released
to the public.

18:20.833 --> 18:21.868
Oh, that's interesting.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.470
So, if this was the handiwork

18:23.570 --> 18:25.638
of a copycat, they wouldn't know
the exact recipe.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.106
Exactly.
Huh.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.008
If Perez or the copycat

18:29.108 --> 18:31.944
continue to follow
Perez's arson pattern,

18:32.044 --> 18:33.680
they're gonna need
more ingredients.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.982
I mean, it would take
a ton of thermite

18:36.082 --> 18:37.184
just to cover this room.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.352
Only a few retailers
where you can buy

18:39.452 --> 18:41.053
iron oxide and
aluminum powder

18:41.154 --> 18:44.657
in bulk. If we can find out
where a large purchase was made,

18:44.757 --> 18:46.259
may lead us to the arsonist.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.461
I'm gonna call Fatima.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.531
<i>Remember?</i>

18:51.631 --> 18:55.067
<i>Feelings cause pain.</i>

19:00.940 --> 19:03.243
<i>So, we've already found
three footprints</i>

19:03.343 --> 19:04.944
heading down
the hallway.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.679
Well, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

19:06.779 --> 19:08.181
but it's
highly unlikely

19:08.281 --> 19:10.483
that an accelerant stuck
to his shoe long enough

19:10.583 --> 19:11.751
for us
to track it outside.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.119
I'll have you
know that I'm a fan

19:13.220 --> 19:15.255
of Forensic Phil's
Freaky Friday channel.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.857
Don't tell me you learned how to
be a detective on the Internet.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.059
If the grooves
on the base of his sole

19:20.159 --> 19:22.462
are deep enough, there's
a chance the thermite residue

19:22.562 --> 19:24.964
may last
a little bit longer.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.600
Well, hopefully,
there's a camera out here.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.137
Check this out.
What you got?

19:31.238 --> 19:32.772
Acceleration marks.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.742
Maybe the arsonist
parked back here.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.311
Or somebody
picked him up.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.646
Oh.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.349
Check this.
I got a footprint.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.683
Well, that
could be anyone.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.918
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.654
Oh!

19:47.754 --> 19:49.756
Wow! Ladies and gentlemen,

19:49.856 --> 19:51.724
that is what
the Internet is for.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.527
You, my friend, got lucky.
Did I?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.296
So, if the car sped east
to the street,

19:56.396 --> 19:58.765
which these
acceleration marks indicate...

19:58.865 --> 20:02.235
Then the arsonist got in
on the passenger's side.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.004
There was a driver.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.740
The arsonist must've
had an accomplice.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.176
Yeah, but Perez
always worked alone.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.913
This is feeling more and more
like a copycat arsonist.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.284
Now, we're
looking for two.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.089
They say that

20:23.189 --> 20:25.358
daydreaming restores
the brain,

20:25.458 --> 20:27.894
but I've always
seen it as

20:27.994 --> 20:30.363
a pastime of
the idle mind.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.231
I'm sorry, Admiral.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.633
I-I wasn't
daydreaming,

20:33.733 --> 20:37.637
I was listening to Rountree
and Agent Morehurst.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.106
Apparently,
they dated a while ago,

20:40.206 --> 20:42.509
and I think
Rountree ghosted her.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.776
Oh, ghosting
is when...

20:43.876 --> 20:46.178
I know what ghosting is,
Agent Namazi.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.781
And, fascinating
as the love lives

20:48.881 --> 20:50.683
of my agents are,

20:50.783 --> 20:52.084
I'd like a sitrep.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.287
Sure.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.957
So, Sam and Deeks were right
about a car leaving the alley

20:58.057 --> 20:59.191
at the time
of the fire.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.760
A traffic cam caught
the getaway car

21:00.860 --> 21:02.261
with two people inside.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.264
Well, that confirms
that the arsonist

21:05.365 --> 21:07.300
has an accomplice.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.735
Could you ID them?

21:08.835 --> 21:11.103
I was able to get an image
of the passenger,

21:11.203 --> 21:13.706
but it's too grainy
for facial rec.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.510
That could be Perez

21:17.610 --> 21:19.178
or Elton John.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.080
Unfortunately,
the plates don't match.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.815
It's most likely stolen. Yeah.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.684
In fact, they belong
to a dead guy.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.053
Well, this is just
dead end after dead end.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.656
Anything come from talking
to Perez's family?

21:29.756 --> 21:31.458
So, I found a number

21:31.558 --> 21:34.794
in Crystal's phone records
believed to be Perez's,

21:34.894 --> 21:37.129
and not long after
Perez's sister, Denise,

21:37.229 --> 21:38.230
left the boatshed,

21:38.331 --> 21:39.932
she also called
the same number.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.769
So, Denise lied to us.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.637
She has been
in contact with Perez.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.038
Where is she now?

21:46.138 --> 21:48.274
Rountree and Morehurst
are tailing her.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.376
Well...

21:49.476 --> 21:51.611
even though this is beginning

21:51.711 --> 21:53.312
to look like the arson

21:53.413 --> 21:55.582
is the work
of a copycat,

21:55.682 --> 21:58.150
Denise could still
lead us to Perez.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.920
That's a chance
we shouldn't pass up.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.090
So, keep me updated...

22:04.190 --> 22:06.893
about Denise,
not Rountree's love life,

22:06.993 --> 22:10.229
and, uh, cut the eavesdropping.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.331
Understood, sir.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.334
Hey, guys?

22:15.435 --> 22:16.436
'Sup, Fatima?

22:16.536 --> 22:18.738
I located two stores that carry

22:18.838 --> 22:20.907
the type of iron oxide
and aluminum powder

22:21.007 --> 22:23.175
used to make thermite
in the bulk that was needed.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.311
Now, one of them
made a large delivery

22:25.412 --> 22:28.548
to a company called
Core Dynamics in Highland Park

22:28.648 --> 22:29.849
two days ago.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.484
Company has no DBA,

22:31.584 --> 22:32.919
and the address

22:33.019 --> 22:34.353
is actually
an apartment building.

22:34.454 --> 22:37.089
Send us the address.
We're on our way.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.605
Hey, hey.
Wait a minute.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.173
For what?
Denise lied to us.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.875
She's known how to reach Perez
this whole time.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.077
I'm taking her in.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.513
She keeps checking
her phone, all right?

23:00.613 --> 23:01.781
She's probably meeting somebody.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.851
It could be Perez.

23:07.286 --> 23:08.988
We got movement.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.999
It's Perez.
Told you it wasn't a copycat.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.639
Federal agents.
I've got Perez.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.175
Out of the car.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.351
Rountree!

23:50.530 --> 23:51.564
Perez!

23:51.664 --> 23:53.299
Stop!

23:55.735 --> 23:57.770
Out of the car now.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.907
Damn it!

24:10.249 --> 24:11.784
What was the name
of the website?

24:11.884 --> 24:15.021
- Www.
- ParkYourAuto.com.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.089
Brings in an extra

24:17.189 --> 24:18.324
$200 per month.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.059
Got to have
a side hustle.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.494
Easy money.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.462
We'll need a list
of all your tenants.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.797
Not a problem.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.203
Where the hell is the car?

24:31.303 --> 24:33.506
Looks like
a prep station.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.376
Stop!
What the hell are you doing?

24:39.311 --> 24:41.581
I'm saving your life.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.017
That's probably an IED
set to trigger an accelerant.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.687
Burn this place down
and cover their tracks.

24:47.787 --> 24:48.788
Fatima,

24:48.888 --> 24:51.724
have LAPD roll a unit out here.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.627
Tell them we found an IED.
We need the bomb squad.

24:59.398 --> 25:00.700
You can take me to jail.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.868
I have nothing
to say to you two.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.102
I don't think
you get it.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.537
You're looking at life in prison

25:04.637 --> 25:07.073
for the attempted murder
of two federal agents,

25:07.173 --> 25:09.609
let alone aiding and abetting
a known fugitive.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.578
A judge may be more lenient
if they know

25:11.678 --> 25:13.613
you cooperated
with the investigation.

25:13.713 --> 25:16.082
Randall did not set this fire.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.151
You want to pin it on him
because of his past.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.720
He said you guys would do this.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.522
How are you so sure
he's innocent of this new fire?

25:23.623 --> 25:25.758
I was around when Randy
got caught up

25:25.858 --> 25:28.127
in all the activism
and protesting.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.361
He believed
in his cause

25:29.461 --> 25:31.831
and thought he was doing
the right thing.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.033
That's the only reason
I forgave him.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.969
We know that
there were two people

25:37.069 --> 25:39.438
connected to this fire yesterday.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.107
Do you know
if he worked with anyone?

25:41.207 --> 25:44.677
How could he work with someone
if he didn't do it?

25:48.114 --> 25:49.415
Hey, guys.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.350
Am I clear to approach?
It's clear.

25:51.450 --> 25:52.752
Bomb squad
disabled the IED.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.087
Yeah, there wasn't enough
explosive in the IED

25:55.187 --> 25:56.756
to do much damage,

25:56.856 --> 25:59.826
but with all
the accelerant residue...

25:59.926 --> 26:02.161
...it could've taken
out the entire building.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.596
Thank you.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.198
Hold on to that.
Where's Callen?

26:06.298 --> 26:07.433
Ah, Kilbride
said he's busy,

26:07.533 --> 26:08.701
so he sent me.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.402
I don't remember
anything about Perez

26:10.502 --> 26:11.470
setting booby traps.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.939
There's a lot
about this case

26:13.039 --> 26:14.506
that doesn't match Perez,
but we can't ignore the fact

26:14.607 --> 26:16.709
that he's back in town.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.010
So, this is all I could

26:18.110 --> 26:21.213
find of the combined accelerant.
You're up.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.816
All right, now, if this sample
matches Perez's recipe,

26:23.916 --> 26:26.853
at least we can confirm
that he's one of our arsonists.

26:26.953 --> 26:30.322
So, uh... what's your
take on Morehurst?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.458
She was nice...

26:32.558 --> 26:33.693
till Rountree came in.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.494
Oh, yeah?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.896
Wait, what'd I miss?

26:36.996 --> 26:39.431
Agent Morehurst and Rountree
used to date.

26:39.531 --> 26:42.101
Oh, that's the good tea.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.636
Tell me more.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.504
I think there's still
some romantic tension there, no?

26:45.604 --> 26:46.973
They kind of remind me of

26:47.073 --> 26:49.075
<i>When Harry Met Sally...</i>
meets <i>Love Jones.</i>

26:49.175 --> 26:50.209
You know
what I mean?

26:50.309 --> 26:51.343
No, I don't know
what you mean.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.679
Uh-uh.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.080
Does Rountree know
you're listening in?

26:54.180 --> 26:56.182
It's not my fault
they don't turn off their comms.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.921
Okay, we've got iron oxide,

27:02.021 --> 27:04.991
aluminum--
which makes classic thermite--

27:05.091 --> 27:07.426
and... sulfur.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.128
That's Perez's
secret ingredient.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.630
It's an exact match
for Perez's recipe.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.232
Check this out.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.902
Hm, see what I can find.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.439
Map of Glendale.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.274
That's where Global West
is located.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.377
This bin is full of a bunch of
different maps of Los Angeles.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.413
Okay, I think
I found something.

27:27.513 --> 27:28.514
All right,
I did a search for

27:28.614 --> 27:30.750
Global West, and I found a list.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.418
Global West is fifth
on that list.

27:32.518 --> 27:35.487
Any one of the places
on that list could be a target.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.690
Okay, we got
a healthcare company,

27:37.790 --> 27:39.391
uh, an investment bank,

27:39.491 --> 27:42.061
and a shoe manufacturer.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.196
What do those companies
have in common with Global West?

27:44.296 --> 27:47.867
I don't know, but any
of those places could get hit.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.936
Alert LAPD.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.771
Make sure all of those
locations are notified.

27:52.638 --> 27:54.173
Sam, Deeks.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.541
I have new information

27:55.641 --> 27:57.710
on the dead man's
license plates.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.546
The plates belonged
to a Christian Navarro,

28:00.646 --> 28:03.783
who died last year,
but, before he died,

28:03.883 --> 28:05.852
his car was involved
in two DUIs,

28:05.952 --> 28:08.420
both committed by his son,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.256
Marco Navarro.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.523
Now, I ran him

28:11.623 --> 28:13.392
against Perez and found that

28:13.492 --> 28:14.927
they had been arrested together

28:15.027 --> 28:18.697
multiple times at different
climate change protests.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.599
That could be
Perez's accomplice.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.135
Or Navarro influenced Perez,

28:23.235 --> 28:24.403
changed his MO.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.739
Well, unfortunately,
the Navarro family

28:26.839 --> 28:29.575
no longer lives
at the address on file,

28:29.675 --> 28:31.610
but I am sending
his picture over.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.145
I've already sent it
to Rountree.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.914
Maybe this will get
Denise talking.

28:35.014 --> 28:38.650
But I may have
an address on Perez.

28:38.751 --> 28:41.287
The last known location

28:41.387 --> 28:44.023
of the burner phone
was a house in Echo Park.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.758
I am sending it
to your phones now.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.159
Copy that.

28:50.763 --> 28:53.699
Hey, man, uh, Delivery Wizard.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.468
I got a, uh,
Philly Cheesesteak here for...

28:56.568 --> 28:58.304
Perez. Oh, hey.
How are you, sir?

29:00.172 --> 29:01.808
I didn't order anything.
You got the wrong house.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.442
Oh, yeah, no,
it definitely says it.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.044
You're Perez, right? Because
it's already been paid for.

29:05.144 --> 29:08.147
I got it here written
on the app-- Federal agents.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.816
Sam, he's coming to you.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.652
Not so fast.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.021
I didn't do anything.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.123
Where's Navarro?
We know you're working with him.

29:17.223 --> 29:20.426
We're not working together.

29:20.526 --> 29:21.727
I've been trying to stop him.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.029
Yeah, give me your hand.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.833
House is clear.
LAPD's on the way.

29:28.234 --> 29:31.137
Navarro's out there,
preparing to set another fire.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.138
Where is he?

29:32.238 --> 29:33.906
I have no idea.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.407
Look, I'm looking for him, too.

29:35.507 --> 29:36.876
That is the God's honest truth.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.110
So, if you're
not involved,

29:38.210 --> 29:39.645
how'd you know Navarro
started the fire?

29:39.745 --> 29:41.247
Before I went underground,

29:41.347 --> 29:43.182
I asked him to keep
some of my stuff.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.853
I had a pipette filled with the
accelerant mixture that I use.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.454
Navarro is smart.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.823
Must've broke it down
with a mass spectrometer.

29:50.923 --> 29:52.324
When I heard
about the fire

29:52.424 --> 29:54.326
and that someone
was using my signature,

29:54.426 --> 29:56.528
I knew it had to be Navarro.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.597
Assume we believe you.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.833
Navarro started
this latest fire.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.702
We know he had an accomplice.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.337
If not you, then who?

30:05.437 --> 30:06.672
I don't know.

30:06.772 --> 30:09.475
When I met Navarro,
he was young, mad,

30:09.575 --> 30:11.077
and impressionable.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.779
He wanted to change the world.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.282
He used to hang out
at the house all the time.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.583
He became like family.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.385
When he found out
who I was,

30:19.485 --> 30:21.921
he wanted to join me,
but I put him off.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.423
I swear, we are not
working together.

30:24.523 --> 30:25.958
Navarro know your sister?

30:26.058 --> 30:29.261
No, no. I lived on the other
side of town from Denise.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.863
What about Crystal?

30:30.963 --> 30:32.164
She know Navarro?

30:32.264 --> 30:34.533
Yeah, he was like
a big brother to her.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.135
If Crystal's close

30:36.235 --> 30:38.938
to Navarro, she may still
be in contact with him.

30:40.106 --> 30:42.008
Rountree?
What's up, Sam?

30:42.108 --> 30:43.409
Was Castor able to locate

30:43.509 --> 30:44.643
Crystal?

30:44.743 --> 30:45.744
No. We tried to reach her,

30:45.844 --> 30:47.079
but her phone's turned off.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.447
Denise said
this wasn't like her,

30:48.547 --> 30:49.815
and, according to her job,

30:49.916 --> 30:51.450
she hasn't been to work
in over a week.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.019
She quit out of the blue.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.922
Crystal quit her job.
We can't locate her.

30:56.022 --> 30:59.558
When you spoke with her,
did she ever mention Navarro?

30:59.658 --> 31:01.427
No. I mean...

31:01.527 --> 31:03.562
Maybe I mentioned him
from time to time,

31:03.662 --> 31:05.364
just telling old stories, yeah.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.466
Did Crystal know Navarro
has your stuff?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.469
Yes. Maybe...

31:10.569 --> 31:12.438
Listen, if you think
that she is involved

31:12.538 --> 31:13.739
with Navarro, you're wrong.

31:13.839 --> 31:16.542
She knows that I regret
what I did.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.345
Or you regret
getting caught.

31:27.954 --> 31:30.122
Alert me as soon
as you know.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.592
My agents found Crystal's car
at a mini-mart in Sylmar.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.594
Hmm.
A clerk saw her get
into a light blue sedan

31:35.694 --> 31:37.930
with a man that matches
Navarro's description.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.632
They're checking the camera
for plates. Denise?

31:40.732 --> 31:43.302
She doesn't recall Crystal
mentioning any new friends

31:43.402 --> 31:45.837
or acting suspicious, but...

31:45.938 --> 31:48.074
she could be lying
to cover up for Crystal.

31:48.174 --> 31:49.708
Just like
she protected Perez.

31:51.077 --> 31:53.079
If Crystal and Navarro
are both intent

31:53.179 --> 31:55.047
on carrying out Perez's mission,

31:55.147 --> 31:56.615
where's the environmental angle?

31:56.715 --> 31:59.451
Maybe we're looking
at this all wrong. Hmm.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.488
If Navarro
has sought out Crystal,

32:02.588 --> 32:04.890
then maybe he has
his own agenda. Mm.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.658
Rountree, you might be right.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.494
I broadened my search
to find a connection

32:08.594 --> 32:10.862
between the companies
on the list from the garage,

32:10.963 --> 32:12.031
and I found one.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.533
All the companies
donated large sums

32:14.633 --> 32:17.203
to Senator Greg Garrett's
reelection campaign.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.705
Okay, so why attack
the companies?

32:19.805 --> 32:22.508
Garrett recently killed a major
climate bill in the Senate.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.576
They want to punish the
companies for supporting him

32:24.676 --> 32:25.777
and keeping him in office.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.646
So, what's the
next target?

32:27.746 --> 32:29.448
The senator's in town.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.450
He's touring
an abandoned factory

32:31.550 --> 32:32.985
that's part of
an urban renewal project

32:33.085 --> 32:34.786
in Newhall,
but it's not on the list.

32:34.886 --> 32:37.823
That's near Sylmar, where
Crystal met up with Navarro.

32:37.923 --> 32:40.892
If Crystal and Navarro
are headed to that factory...

32:40.993 --> 32:42.461
Then they're not trying
to attack any of the companies,

32:42.561 --> 32:43.762
they're after the senator.
Mm-hmm.

32:43.862 --> 32:45.631
Fatima, can you alert
Deeks and Sam

32:45.731 --> 32:47.799
and the senator's team?
We're on our way.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.943
Looks like the senator's
already arrived.

32:58.044 --> 33:00.379
Fatima, were you able to speak
to the senator's team?

33:00.479 --> 33:02.348
Yes. We're evacuating everyone.

33:02.448 --> 33:03.982
If Crystal and Navarro
came straight from Sylmar,

33:04.083 --> 33:05.851
they're gonna have
an hour-long jump on us.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.486
That's enough time to lay down
accelerant and torch this place.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.888
You two. We got to find
the senator fast.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.834
Any sign of the senator?

33:22.934 --> 33:24.136
No, not yet.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.372
No sign of Crystal or Navarro.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.979
12 o'clock.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.381
Federal agents!

33:35.481 --> 33:37.716
We got eyes on Crystal.
Keep looking for Garrett.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.657
Senator Garrett.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.926
We're here to get you and
your team out of here safely.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.395
I'm with NCIS.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.631
Get behind me.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.568
I got Navarro.

33:57.936 --> 33:59.871
Crystal, you've already
done enough damage.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.840
Come out.
We can help you.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.675
Doesn't look like
there's an exit.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.711
She's got
to be in here.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.913
It's an old building,
she might have found a way out.

34:08.814 --> 34:11.049
Rountree, Morehurst,
keep eyes out for Crystal.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.752
Copy that.
Rountree is on Navarro.

34:25.997 --> 34:27.699
Guys, I got Navarro.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.202
Crystal, stop!

34:50.356 --> 34:51.723
I got eyes on Crystal.

34:51.823 --> 34:53.925
So do I.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.431
This is over, Crystal.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.133
We have Navarro. Yeah.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.068
We are not the criminals.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.770
We believe you, okay?

35:04.870 --> 35:07.606
We know that Navarro
put you up to this.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.475
Put your
hands up.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.109
I'm covered in thermite.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.212
If you don't let me go,
I will light myself

35:13.312 --> 35:14.980
and this bag on fire!

35:15.080 --> 35:17.283
You know that's not what
your father would've wanted.

35:17.383 --> 35:18.884
He did all of this for you.

35:18.984 --> 35:20.085
He loves you.

35:20.186 --> 35:21.720
You don't have
to do this, Crystal.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.090
Come on.

35:26.057 --> 35:28.093
Come on.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.568
Let's go.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.507
Hands.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.577
You guys good?

35:45.677 --> 35:47.979
Well, nothing
a warm shower

35:48.079 --> 35:49.815
and cold beer
won't fix.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.783
The senator,
are they okay?

35:51.883 --> 35:54.253
His aide's on the way
to the hospital.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.355
Sorry to disappoint you, Crystal.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.357
We put
the fire out.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.192
We knocked it down.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.861
You know, I always wanted
to be a fireman.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.896
Mm.
Mostly just to get
in the calendar.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.865
Really?

36:14.406 --> 36:16.007
Oh, Admiral!

36:16.107 --> 36:17.443
I was just coming
to see you.

36:17.543 --> 36:18.910
Ah, good work today.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.713
And I just got word
that the senator's aide

36:21.813 --> 36:24.316
only suffered a flesh wound
and is doing well.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.551
Well, that is good to hear

36:25.651 --> 36:26.785
'cause Navarro was
out for blood.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.287
That could have been
a lot worse.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.222
Indeed.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.757
You wanted to see me.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.124
Is this about the conference?

36:33.225 --> 36:36.495
Yes, yes,
after extensive consideration,

36:36.595 --> 36:38.497
I have decided...

36:38.597 --> 36:39.731
not to attend.

36:39.831 --> 36:41.633
That's understandable.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.703
I'm sure that Agent Blye
was relieved.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.005
Actually, she was
okay with me going.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.808
And said if I didn't,
that she would.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.378
Ah.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.079
Your call, Agent Deeks.

36:54.179 --> 36:57.716
And a good one,
if I do say so myself.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.218
Thank you, sir.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.153
And don't feel too bad.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.622
There's always...

37:03.722 --> 37:05.857
Albuquerque next year.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.459
I love Albuquerque.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.794
Mm.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.330
And I'll make sure
that Agent Rountree

37:11.430 --> 37:14.600
thanks you for his trip
to Costa Rica.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.404
Don't worry,
I won't let him forget it, sir.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.943
Hey, come on, don't cry.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.513
We'll see each other.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.080
And until then,
we'll write, okay?

37:29.180 --> 37:31.617
I love you,
sweet girl.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.985
Love you, Daddy.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.289
All right, let's go.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.762
Wow, that was bittersweet.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.664
Yeah, it's a shame.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.933
She reaches out to Navarro

37:48.033 --> 37:50.035
to get her father's belongings
and winds up

37:50.135 --> 37:52.304
an arsonist and a murderer.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.005
Yeah.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.408
Hey, uh...
Hmm?

37:56.508 --> 37:58.377
...thanks for coordinating that
with your office,

37:58.477 --> 38:00.312
you know,
so they could see each other. Yeah.

38:00.412 --> 38:01.547
Yeah.
I owe you one.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.114
I saved your life today.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.216
I think you owe me
more like five.

38:06.685 --> 38:09.087
Okay. Five IOUs.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.690
And don't you worry, I'll be
calling in all of those favors.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.858
Mm.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.626
You're gonna call me?

38:16.628 --> 38:18.864
I got to go.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.269
You know what, um,
and thanks for that apology.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.605
I didn't realize
how much I needed that.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.607
It was fun working
with you today.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.409
Yeah, we work
well together.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.110
We do.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.513
Agent Morehurst,
you're still here.

38:34.613 --> 38:35.881
Uh, I was
just leaving.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.549
It was lovely meeting
you, Agent Hanna.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.984
Nice to meet you, as well.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.619
Tell Rasheed
I'll see him next weekend.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.020
I may join him.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.321
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

38:43.422 --> 38:44.322
I'm not a nice guy
in the Pickledome.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.457
Neither am I.

38:45.557 --> 38:46.858
Okay, be ready.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.494
I will. All right, goodnight.
All right.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.829
Good night.

38:54.199 --> 38:55.100
Thought you were leaving.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.167
Yeah, I was, but I figured

38:56.267 --> 38:57.903
I'd get prepped for tomorrow.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.171
Want to get an early start.
How's 4:30 a.m. sound?

39:01.473 --> 39:03.375
Are you gonna call her?

39:03.475 --> 39:05.043
What? Her-- Oh.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.645
Nah, man, she don't
want me to call her.

39:06.745 --> 39:09.080
You know what your problem is?
I see what it is.
What?

39:09.180 --> 39:10.516
When you're faced
with challenges

39:10.616 --> 39:11.850
that have an unknown variable,

39:11.950 --> 39:13.419
you start getting
all in your head.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.621
Sometimes you just got
to do the work, dive in,

39:15.721 --> 39:17.288
enjoy the ride.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.357
Hmm?
Yeah.

39:20.225 --> 39:22.127
You're right, I-I...
I do think...

39:22.227 --> 39:23.862
Call that woman, man, call her!

39:23.962 --> 39:25.964
She's probably still
sitting in the car.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.466
Matter of fact, go, go.
All right, all right, all right.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.500
Go.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.069
Summer, hold up.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.275
I always enjoy
a nice scotch

39:37.375 --> 39:39.210
with a good book.

39:39.310 --> 39:42.414
Yeah, this is
a real page-turner.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.418
Did you read this?

39:46.518 --> 39:48.319
No, no.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.889
But I did call
in some favors

39:50.989 --> 39:53.391
to get everything
I could find.

39:53.492 --> 39:56.428
But this is your story,
Agent Callen.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.664
It is not my place to...

39:58.764 --> 40:00.599
invade your privacy.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.434
Now, that said,

40:02.534 --> 40:04.570
if there's anything in there
you want to talk about,

40:04.670 --> 40:06.237
you know where
to find me.

40:12.177 --> 40:15.146
We've all done things
we regret.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.185
Hetty doesn't seem to be the
kind of person to regret much.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.155
Don't kid yourself.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.458
Now, she may put on
a good front,

40:26.558 --> 40:30.361
but Hetty has enough regrets
for all of us.

40:30.462 --> 40:33.264
She has done things
that most wouldn't...

40:33.364 --> 40:36.134
to keep the rest
of us safe.

40:38.103 --> 40:41.106
Unfortunately,
that comes with some...

40:41.206 --> 40:44.075
very dark, ugly things

40:44.175 --> 40:46.978
that you carry with you
to your grave.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.280
Well, I'm not sure
how indoctrinating children

40:49.380 --> 40:51.016
does much to keep people safe.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.684
I don't know.

40:53.685 --> 40:56.354
Seems to me you keep
people safe every day.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.558
So maybe some good
did come of it.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.461
Even if their methods were...

41:03.562 --> 41:07.098
ethically and morally questionable.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.001
If not reprehensible.

41:12.403 --> 41:15.340
I don't always agree with her.

41:16.675 --> 41:19.210
And I usually don't like
the way she operates.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.380
Hell, I'm not even sure
I even like <i>her</i> most days.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.784
But I damn well respect her.

41:26.585 --> 41:29.921
Henrietta-- and I'm sure
that's not even her real name--

41:30.021 --> 41:32.123
Henrietta has dedicated

41:32.223 --> 41:34.993
her life to
the greater good.

41:35.093 --> 41:36.662
She has made mistakes
along the way

41:36.762 --> 41:38.930
just like the rest of us.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.833
But it was always done
in the service

41:41.933 --> 41:43.969
of this country.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.673
So...

41:47.773 --> 41:50.475
am I a mistake or a...

41:50.576 --> 41:54.245
dark, ugly thing she has
to carry to the grave?

41:58.617 --> 42:01.887
Only you can decide that,
Agent Callen.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.890
But in my experience,

42:04.990 --> 42:07.425
the past is a place
to learn from.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.461
Not to live in.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.732
Enjoy the scotch.

42:14.633 --> 42:17.235
Turn off the lights
when you leave.
