00:00.123 --> 00:01.938
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:02.008 --> 00:05.060
My name is Agent Hoffman.
I'm with the Secret Service.

00:05.062 --> 00:06.627
I think someone is
threatening your family.

00:07.729 --> 00:10.630
This is Vanessa Moore.
My sister.

00:10.632 --> 00:12.432
Vanessa,
have you met Colonel Blair?

00:12.434 --> 00:15.669
Not in person, but I read about
your appointment to the NSA.

00:15.671 --> 00:17.338
I loved your brother very much.

00:17.340 --> 00:18.672
He would have been President
someday.

00:18.674 --> 00:20.774
He would have been President
now.

00:20.776 --> 00:22.009
Our mutual friend is here.

00:23.245 --> 00:24.511
I wanted to keep her in the loop.

00:26.180 --> 00:27.914
Hello, Quentin.

00:27.916 --> 00:30.250
This is a conspiracy that
goes way beyond Duncan.

00:30.252 --> 00:31.685
What makes you believe him?

00:31.687 --> 00:34.120
Open your eyes, Brian,
the FBI, the Secret Service

00:34.122 --> 00:36.089
this is bigger than any one man.

00:36.091 --> 00:39.092
We need to know exactly when Kincaid
plans to go public, and that is on you.

00:39.094 --> 00:41.094
And what if that's before
the scheduled surgery?

00:41.096 --> 00:43.329
Well, we re-evaluate where
we stand with everything.

00:43.331 --> 00:44.663
I say we start with his family.

00:44.665 --> 00:46.132
He warned you to stay away
from his daughter.

00:46.134 --> 00:48.430
That's why I'm going
after his wife.

00:48.568 --> 00:49.936
Your wife is a very sick woman.

00:52.006 --> 00:53.706
I took the safety valve off.

00:53.708 --> 00:57.175
I can dump 20 cc of morphine into
her before you take another step.

00:57.177 --> 00:59.620
- She's innocent.
- So is my family.

01:01.515 --> 01:03.649
Ellen, I know you're upset,

01:03.651 --> 01:04.849
that you want answers.

01:04.852 --> 01:06.652
Why are you doing this?

01:06.654 --> 01:07.953
The reason doesn't matter.

01:07.955 --> 01:09.822
- It does to me.
- Put down the morphine.

01:11.958 --> 01:13.858
Please.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.993
You don't want to kill
an innocent woman.

01:17.029 --> 01:18.029
Like Angela?

01:19.698 --> 01:21.265
Like the President?

01:21.267 --> 01:23.835
He's not innocent.

01:23.837 --> 01:25.804
You get to decide who's
innocent and who's guilty.

01:25.806 --> 01:27.439
Who gets to live.

01:27.441 --> 01:30.041
Who are you? God?

01:31.877 --> 01:34.511
Excuse me?
What are you doing?

01:34.513 --> 01:36.013
Why are you touching her IV?

01:37.082 --> 01:38.749
Henry, it's okay, I uh...

01:38.751 --> 01:40.851
I ran into Dr. Sanders
in the hallway,

01:40.853 --> 01:42.987
and asked her
to check on the drip.

01:42.989 --> 01:46.023
Nina was complaining of pain
earlier in the evening.

01:46.025 --> 01:48.024
Is there a problem
with her drip line?

01:48.026 --> 01:49.593
No.

01:49.595 --> 01:50.794
It's all working fine now.

01:56.634 --> 01:59.302
You said the President is not
innocent, what did you mean?

01:59.304 --> 02:00.671
We can discuss that later.

02:04.608 --> 02:07.344
Right now, you need to get
home to your daughter.

02:07.346 --> 02:08.711
Why?

02:08.713 --> 02:10.545
Morgan's boyfriend
came by the house.

02:11.949 --> 02:13.083
He brought a gun.

02:14.785 --> 02:16.019
Oh, my God.

02:20.824 --> 02:22.257
What are you talking about?

02:22.259 --> 02:24.159
Why would you think my
family is being threatened?

02:24.161 --> 02:27.196
Let's just say your wife
is the common denominator

02:27.198 --> 02:30.299
in a series of coincidences that
all connect to the President.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.635
What are you suggesting?

02:32.637 --> 02:36.205
Your wife is a respected doctor.

02:36.207 --> 02:37.939
An exemplary citizen.

02:37.941 --> 02:40.309
And she has no reason to
assassinate the President,

02:40.311 --> 02:41.977
unless she's being coerced.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.189 --> 02:55.924
No one else knows that you're here.

02:57.026 --> 02:59.293
So this is your chance
to speak openly.

03:02.598 --> 03:03.598
I...

03:08.738 --> 03:10.538
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.140
Everything's fine.

03:12.142 --> 03:13.374
Nobody's threatening us.

03:15.845 --> 03:19.613
Okay. Sorry to have taken up
your time, Mr. Sanders.

03:20.916 --> 03:22.083
You can go.

03:27.856 --> 03:28.822
Thank you.

03:31.026 --> 03:33.027
Boyd loved me.

03:34.963 --> 03:36.163
I know.

03:37.498 --> 03:39.667
I know, sweetheart.
I am so sorry.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.541
You did this.

03:47.543 --> 03:48.542
No.

03:51.345 --> 03:52.579
He protected me.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.995
You okay?

04:08.997 --> 04:10.897
Yeah.

04:10.899 --> 04:12.364
The vest stops the bullet,

04:12.366 --> 04:14.033
but it still hurts
like a son of a bitch.

04:16.269 --> 04:17.570
But I've been through worse.

04:26.513 --> 04:27.746
You could have been killed.

05:08.453 --> 05:10.955
You need to start collecting
stamps or something.

05:13.659 --> 05:16.226
I thought the interview with the
husband was a bust last night.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.262
I'm not looking at
Dr. Sanders right now,

05:18.264 --> 05:20.497
but I am looking at the hospital.

05:20.499 --> 05:22.799
You have to ask yourself,
"Why would the White House

05:22.801 --> 05:25.135
"pick Maryland College Hospital?"

05:25.137 --> 05:27.037
There was a rigorous
selection process.

05:27.039 --> 05:28.405
We looked into all this.

05:28.407 --> 05:30.774
I started over last night.

05:30.776 --> 05:33.210
I think somebody might
have rigged the game.

05:33.212 --> 05:34.444
What are you talking about?

05:39.483 --> 05:42.018
"Maryland College Hospital
incident report.

05:42.020 --> 05:44.821
"Filed September 4th
with the joint commissioner."

05:44.823 --> 05:46.556
Hospitals file these things annually.

05:46.558 --> 05:48.825
They report fatalities, injuries.

05:48.827 --> 05:50.626
Now this one,
the White House copy,

05:50.628 --> 05:53.163
shows 245 negative incidents.

05:53.165 --> 05:56.232
The Maryland College Hospital
copy shows 479.

06:01.605 --> 06:03.639
Why would someone
change the number?

06:03.641 --> 06:06.942
To make sure the President wound up
at this particular hospital.

06:10.181 --> 06:12.347
I have a Bill Jones on the line.

06:12.349 --> 06:13.548
He says it's urgent.

06:17.020 --> 06:19.321
- Hello.
- We need to talk. Now.

06:20.389 --> 06:21.656
I'll call you back.

06:30.566 --> 06:32.300
You have to be kidding me.

06:32.302 --> 06:34.569
He's cross-referencing
hospital filings?

06:34.571 --> 06:36.338
Like I said, he's thorough.

06:36.340 --> 06:37.939
He thinks someone on the inside

06:37.941 --> 06:40.808
influenced the decision
to use Dr. Sanders.

06:40.810 --> 06:42.611
Did he mention my name?

06:42.613 --> 06:44.545
Not yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

07:13.661 --> 07:17.396
So, what, Hoffman just brought you
into his office to ask questions?

07:17.398 --> 07:20.232
He wanted to know if
anyone was threatening us.

07:20.234 --> 07:22.869
He's a smart guy.
Pretty much figured out what's going on.

07:22.871 --> 07:25.604
- What did you say?
- I said everything is great.

07:26.673 --> 07:28.807
Did he believe you?

07:28.809 --> 07:30.576
I think so, but...

07:30.578 --> 07:32.844
- He's relentless.
- Maybe it's a good thing.

07:32.846 --> 07:34.613
We've been through this.

07:34.615 --> 07:37.650
If we talk to any kind of law
enforcement, it's basically suicide.

07:37.652 --> 07:40.518
Look, I know what we agreed
to but maybe we're wrong.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.421
Maybe it's smarter to bet on
Hoffman to get us out of this.

07:43.423 --> 07:44.923
I'd rather bet on myself.

07:47.359 --> 07:48.794
Ellen.

07:48.796 --> 07:50.062
We need to talk.

08:00.406 --> 08:03.708
I just got word, you'll be using
the OR on the fourth floor.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.876
Fourth? My surgeries
are always on the fifth.

08:05.878 --> 08:07.245
Not this one.

08:07.247 --> 08:08.346
Rules have changed.

08:10.148 --> 08:12.417
You need to deposit
this in the scrub room

08:12.419 --> 08:14.819
on the fourth floor,
locker 715.

08:14.821 --> 08:16.420
By 11:30.

08:16.422 --> 08:19.190
After that, the fourth
floor will be on lockdown.

08:19.192 --> 08:20.357
Full body searches.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.529
An associate will make
sure it's not discovered.

08:25.531 --> 08:28.498
Locker 715, fourth floor.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.600
11:30.

08:58.062 --> 08:59.462
Hoffman.

08:59.464 --> 09:00.730
He's obsessed.

09:00.732 --> 09:02.598
He's been sleeping in the office.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.568
Analyzing documents, statistics.

09:05.570 --> 09:07.436
How close is he?

09:07.438 --> 09:08.771
Close enough
that he needs to go.

09:10.474 --> 09:11.641
Go?

09:13.109 --> 09:14.310
That's what I've been told.

09:21.217 --> 09:22.550
You think that's the right move?

09:23.853 --> 09:25.254
Doesn't matter what I think.

09:34.864 --> 09:36.197
Carlisle?

09:37.500 --> 09:40.001
I think we have a mutual friend.

09:40.003 --> 09:42.036
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

09:42.038 --> 09:43.204
The guy who plays tennis.

09:47.777 --> 09:50.612
Once the President flatlines,
we're going to need five minutes alone.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.614
For what?

09:54.749 --> 09:55.983
Not your concern.

09:57.652 --> 09:59.620
Five minutes is a long time.

09:59.622 --> 10:02.123
Our friend said you
could make it happen.

10:02.125 --> 10:03.424
I'll work on it.

10:04.693 --> 10:06.760
Is this going to be an issue?

10:06.762 --> 10:08.562
Yes or no?

10:08.564 --> 10:09.630
No.

10:16.538 --> 10:19.172
It's not easy to take out
a Secret Service agent.

10:20.274 --> 10:22.042
We'll need your help with this.

10:25.179 --> 10:26.713
Is there going to be
a problem with that?

10:29.150 --> 10:30.250
No.

10:38.826 --> 10:40.861
- Hey!
- Hey, how are you?

10:40.863 --> 10:42.428
Good.

10:42.430 --> 10:46.866
But things are crazy at home
with college applications.

10:46.868 --> 10:48.401
Where's Morgan applying?

10:50.036 --> 10:54.240
Columbia and Dartmouth
are her favorites, so...

10:54.242 --> 10:57.276
- We'll see.
- Oh, she was always so smart.

10:57.278 --> 10:58.543
How's she doing these days?

10:58.545 --> 11:00.746
I bet she's absolutely beautiful.

11:00.748 --> 11:02.581
She is terrific.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.517
Listen, I gotta run, huh?

11:05.519 --> 11:07.419
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, hon.

12:11.549 --> 12:12.983
How you holding up?

12:15.119 --> 12:16.253
Okay.

12:25.128 --> 12:27.697
Look, I'm sorry
I got you into this.

12:27.699 --> 12:30.299
No. You didn't.
I asked to be a part of it.

12:33.270 --> 12:36.105
I'd just never thought
it would get to this.

12:36.107 --> 12:37.340
The nurse.

12:38.442 --> 12:40.276
The limo driver.

12:40.278 --> 12:42.078
Now that kid, Boyd.

12:46.483 --> 12:48.150
Let's just hope it ends there.

12:49.886 --> 12:50.886
It won't.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.023
They're gonna take out Hoffman.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.298
Well, if that's what they want.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.035
There's nothing
we can do about it.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.138
Unless I can convince him
to drop the case.

13:10.140 --> 13:11.572
We're not criminals.

13:15.577 --> 13:19.114
I've been chasing a few leads,
but I haven't found anything interesting.

13:19.116 --> 13:21.049
Not yet, but I'll keep digging.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.851
Good, because the answer's
out there somewhere.

13:23.853 --> 13:25.086
We just need to find it.

13:30.191 --> 13:31.392
You disagree?

13:33.128 --> 13:36.163
In my experience, when I have
to work too hard to find an answer,

13:36.165 --> 13:37.732
there isn't one.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.234
Maybe the reason we can't
crack this case is because

13:40.236 --> 13:42.003
there's nothing to crack.

13:42.005 --> 13:44.138
What if Angela really
did commit suicide?

13:44.140 --> 13:47.474
She was depressed, she jumped off
the bridge into the Chesapeake,

13:47.476 --> 13:49.109
and her body washed out to sea.

13:49.111 --> 13:51.578
So, you think I've lost my mind?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.680
I think certain people never
know when to give up.

13:55.150 --> 13:57.617
You're probably right.
I can be stubborn.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.553
But not on this one.

13:59.555 --> 14:02.388
I have a new lead and it points
to someone in the White House.

14:03.691 --> 14:05.358
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:07.328 --> 14:08.528
Excuse me.

14:11.331 --> 14:15.368
Hello, sweetheart.
Hey, listen, I can't talk right now.

14:15.370 --> 14:18.438
Great.
I'll see you when I get home.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.005
Yeah, I love you.

14:24.010 --> 14:25.744
My wife.

14:25.746 --> 14:29.248
She gets nervous whenever we don't
touch base a few times a day.

14:32.453 --> 14:33.852
How's she doing?

14:33.854 --> 14:35.520
Not too good.

14:35.522 --> 14:36.755
Can't really blame her.

14:38.558 --> 14:40.926
It was him or you.

14:40.928 --> 14:42.294
You did the right thing.

14:48.401 --> 14:50.102
What else is going on?

14:50.104 --> 14:53.071
That guy still after you
for the money?

14:53.073 --> 14:54.339
You want some help with him?

14:54.341 --> 14:56.341
Thanks, but I'm good for now.

14:56.343 --> 14:58.943
I paid off a large chunk
of my debt.

14:58.945 --> 15:01.045
Wow.

15:01.047 --> 15:02.247
Kramer hooked me up.

15:03.749 --> 15:05.317
Really?

15:05.319 --> 15:06.484
Tell me more.

15:08.087 --> 15:09.286
I'd rather not.

15:10.889 --> 15:12.423
Well, now I'm really intrigued.

15:14.093 --> 15:17.028
Sandrine, come with me, we need
to run an errand for Duncan.

15:17.030 --> 15:19.263
You stay here and keep an
eye on Brian and the kids.

15:19.265 --> 15:21.132
Oh, you giving orders now, huh?

15:23.335 --> 15:24.835
I'm passing them along.

15:30.908 --> 15:33.277
It's some type of poison.
A patient ingested it.

15:33.279 --> 15:35.246
She presented
with nausea, vomiting...

15:35.248 --> 15:37.648
I just need you
to analyze it for me.

15:37.650 --> 15:39.916
- Sure, I'll get right on it.
- Great.

15:54.265 --> 15:55.698
What's up, little man?

15:57.701 --> 16:00.570
I heard you met up with Kramer
and his father yesterday.

16:00.572 --> 16:02.872
Uh, yeah.

16:02.874 --> 16:06.476
I just want to say I think
you did the right thing.

16:06.478 --> 16:09.212
Kramer told me all about
your conversation.

16:09.214 --> 16:11.881
I just did what they asked.

16:13.050 --> 16:14.383
I know.

16:18.321 --> 16:20.322
That's why I stopped by.

16:20.324 --> 16:22.224
Say thanks.

16:22.226 --> 16:24.660
Uh, yeah. No problem.

16:24.662 --> 16:27.096
But, look, just so I'm straight.

16:27.098 --> 16:30.532
Tell me your version of the story.

16:47.116 --> 16:48.917
What the hell you want?

16:48.919 --> 16:51.019
Who the hell are you?

16:51.021 --> 16:53.088
I'm looking for a friend.

16:53.090 --> 16:55.156
- Your friend got a name?
- Yeah.

16:55.158 --> 16:57.759
Herman. Goes by Hip.

16:57.761 --> 16:59.027
Found him.

17:00.395 --> 17:03.097
I got a call that you'd be coming.

17:03.099 --> 17:05.366
- What's your name?
- My name doesn't matter.

17:05.367 --> 17:06.967
You ready to talk business?

17:09.971 --> 17:12.707
So, what's the deal
with you and Archer?

17:14.509 --> 17:17.678
Did we ever sleep together?
Yes. Long time ago.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.513
Are we sleeping together now?
No.

17:29.657 --> 17:32.325
That's her. That's the target.

17:32.327 --> 17:33.393
Okay.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.067
- Agent Hoffman.
- Stan, it's Duncan Carlisle.

17:41.069 --> 17:42.502
I just got a tip from an informant,

17:42.504 --> 17:44.871
says she's got some information
about Angela Nix.

17:44.873 --> 17:47.874
I'm gonna meet her in 30 minutes
on the corner of Anacostia and Third.

17:47.876 --> 17:49.442
A place called
The New Dawn restaurant.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.910
Okay, I'll meet you there.

17:54.848 --> 17:56.249
We're all set.

17:56.251 --> 17:57.516
He'll be here soon.

18:14.268 --> 18:17.202
He'll be at the location
in 25 minutes.

18:17.204 --> 18:18.671
You'll move on my signal.

18:18.673 --> 18:19.805
Understand?

18:19.807 --> 18:20.972
It's all good.

18:49.301 --> 18:51.369
Just make it look
like a random shooting.

18:53.205 --> 18:54.705
Good.

18:54.707 --> 18:56.674
Let me know the second it's done.

19:20.265 --> 19:22.732
Your timing is impeccable.

19:22.734 --> 19:25.102
I just spoke to our friend.

19:25.104 --> 19:26.836
Our problem's about to disappear.

19:26.838 --> 19:27.837
Good.

19:38.282 --> 19:40.149
Well?

19:40.151 --> 19:42.719
That was our friend,
the Chief of Staff.

19:42.721 --> 19:43.987
Things are in motion.

19:46.390 --> 19:49.025
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

19:57.468 --> 20:01.003
The risk of not doing it
outweighs the risk of doing it.

20:01.005 --> 20:03.106
So, yes.

20:03.108 --> 20:04.340
It's necessary.

20:14.550 --> 20:16.418
"We sleep safely at night because

20:16.420 --> 20:19.554
"rough men stand ready to visit violence
against those who would harm us."

20:21.224 --> 20:23.191
Patton.

20:23.193 --> 20:24.994
Churchill.

20:27.896 --> 20:32.234
You know,
you are going to make a great...

20:32.236 --> 20:33.801
President, one day.

20:59.361 --> 21:00.727
Target is in position.

21:03.097 --> 21:04.198
Game time.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.066
- Get ready.
- Copy that, boss.

21:22.484 --> 21:24.617
- Agent Carlisle.
- I just got here.

21:24.619 --> 21:27.554
I'm stuck in a little traffic,
I'll be there in about five minutes.

21:27.556 --> 21:28.722
Okay.

21:47.007 --> 21:48.641
These guys know the target is a Fed?

21:50.410 --> 21:52.712
They don't know.
They wouldn't care anyway.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.480
You sure it won't come back to us?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.316
Positive.

21:57.318 --> 21:59.051
It'll look like what it is.

21:59.053 --> 22:01.520
Hoffman was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

22:01.522 --> 22:04.023
A victim of gang violence.

22:04.025 --> 22:05.758
His wife gets a pension.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.052
- What the hell is he doing?
- What's with this guy?

22:37.856 --> 22:40.090
Call Hoffman. Keep him there.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.596
- Hello?
- Stan.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.364
It's me. I'm pretty close.

22:48.366 --> 22:52.468
Hey listen, no worries. I'm just
enjoying the beautiful scenery here.

22:52.470 --> 22:55.806
- I bet.
- By the way, this informant...

22:55.808 --> 22:56.873
Is she credible?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.441
Yeah, she's solid.

22:58.443 --> 23:00.677
Oh, there you are.
I see you up ahead.

23:05.616 --> 23:07.550
Yo! Move out the way!

23:14.091 --> 23:16.959
Hey, sweetheart,
I can't talk right now.

23:16.961 --> 23:18.994
I'm sorry, sir,
there's been a car accident.

23:18.996 --> 23:21.596
This phone was found
next to the victim.

23:21.598 --> 23:23.866
- What?
- You need to come to the emergency room

23:23.868 --> 23:25.600
at GW Medical Center right away.

23:33.710 --> 23:36.578
Yo! Move out of the way!

23:36.580 --> 23:39.748
Are you deaf?
Move out of the way!

23:48.190 --> 23:49.623
Where the hell did he go?

23:49.625 --> 23:51.092
Find him. Now.

24:15.717 --> 24:17.284
No sign of him, man.
He's gone.

24:17.286 --> 24:18.952
Keep looking.

24:18.954 --> 24:20.520
What the hell happened?
Where did he go?

24:20.522 --> 24:22.055
I don't know. Call him.

24:22.057 --> 24:23.957
Maybe he just went around the
corner to take a leak or something.

24:23.959 --> 24:26.260
Maybe he's still close by.

24:27.428 --> 24:28.929
Hoffman.

24:31.299 --> 24:33.100
We missed our chance.

24:35.736 --> 24:37.003
Now what?

24:53.587 --> 24:56.189
Ah, Ellen, I was just
about to come to your office.

24:56.191 --> 24:58.225
I thought I'd save you a trip.

24:58.227 --> 25:00.393
Did you get a chance to analyze
that sample I gave you?

25:00.395 --> 25:02.228
I, I did.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.597
Tell me again.
Where did you get this from?

25:06.200 --> 25:08.835
The patient's father brought it to me.
He was concerned.

25:08.837 --> 25:10.436
Thought it might be toxic. Why?

25:10.438 --> 25:12.471
It's not poison.

25:12.473 --> 25:15.074
It's dimethyl sulfoxide.

25:15.076 --> 25:18.009
Dimethyl sulfoxide,
isn't that a preservative?

25:18.011 --> 25:20.045
It's a bone marrow preservative.

25:20.047 --> 25:23.515
Mostly, it's for leukemia patients.

25:23.517 --> 25:27.553
You would need to ingest an awful
lot of this to cause a reaction.

25:27.555 --> 25:29.955
Are you sure that this is
what made your patient ill?

25:29.957 --> 25:32.658
Uh, well, apparently not.

25:32.660 --> 25:35.060
Well, thank you.
This information is very helpful.

25:41.968 --> 25:44.302
All right, gentlemen,
let's get down to business.

25:44.304 --> 25:46.905
Where are we on
the exit plan for OTI?

25:46.907 --> 25:50.441
If you are going to distance
yourself from this program,

25:50.443 --> 25:52.109
you're gonna need a fall guy.

25:52.111 --> 25:54.111
More than one.

25:54.113 --> 25:56.247
We'll need some time
to get our ducks in a row, sir.

25:56.249 --> 25:58.883
This thing could blow up in our faces.
The sooner, the better.

25:58.885 --> 26:00.685
Excuse me a moment,
Mr. President.

26:07.292 --> 26:09.193
I assume you're calling
with good news?

26:09.195 --> 26:11.095
You assume wrong.

26:11.097 --> 26:13.798
- What happened?
- It doesn't matter, we didn't get it done.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.334
- What now?
- Not sure.

26:18.469 --> 26:20.437
I'll get back to you in a few hours.

26:30.815 --> 26:32.316
Sorry, Mr. President.

26:34.319 --> 26:35.985
My wife.

26:35.987 --> 26:39.489
Sometimes she forgets that you're
the leader of the free world.

26:39.491 --> 26:41.991
That's all right. So does mine.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.414
- Where you been?
- Running an errand for Duncan.

27:07.217 --> 27:09.385
What sort of errand?

27:09.387 --> 27:11.754
I guess if Duncan wanted you
to know he'd have told you.

27:11.756 --> 27:12.755
I wasn't talking to you.

27:14.357 --> 27:16.791
We were making a delivery.
No big deal.

27:16.793 --> 27:18.493
Duncan didn't tell us what it was.

27:18.495 --> 27:20.562
Relax, tough guy.

27:20.564 --> 27:22.497
We're on the same team, remember?

27:22.499 --> 27:24.699
Then why are you so
worried about where we were?

27:26.035 --> 27:29.004
I just want to make sure my
partners aren't out there

27:29.006 --> 27:30.271
doing anything stupid.

27:31.507 --> 27:32.874
Like killing a limo driver.

27:39.648 --> 27:41.449
Why'd you drag him into this?

27:41.451 --> 27:42.484
I didn't.

27:53.095 --> 27:55.062
Sorry to keep you waiting.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.464
You remember Dr. Evans,
my personal physician?

27:58.867 --> 28:01.202
I'm told you want to do
more blood work today.

28:01.204 --> 28:04.705
Yes, I just want to make sure his blood
clotting factors are back to normal.

28:04.707 --> 28:06.807
Well, let's get this over with.

28:06.809 --> 28:09.410
The surgery isn't
for another six days.

28:09.412 --> 28:10.711
Why not wait?

28:10.713 --> 28:12.279
Test it closer to the date?

28:12.281 --> 28:15.048
Relax, Hank.
Congress shoots arrows at me all day.

28:15.050 --> 28:18.552
I think I can handle a
little needle in the arm.

28:18.554 --> 28:21.321
In light of what happened,
I'll be at the President's side

28:21.323 --> 28:22.855
until the surgery's completed.

28:24.058 --> 28:25.825
Happy to have you.

28:25.827 --> 28:27.060
This won't take a minute.

28:37.838 --> 28:39.472
Mr. Creasy.

28:39.474 --> 28:42.274
Agent Hoffman's office called again.
They want to schedule an interview.

28:42.276 --> 28:43.342
Did he say what it was about?

28:43.344 --> 28:44.844
Something to do with Dr. Sanders.

28:45.913 --> 28:48.047
Schedule for tomorrow.

28:48.049 --> 28:50.182
Also, Colonel Blair is looking for you.

29:05.431 --> 29:06.831
I'll help you.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.299
Thank you, sir.

29:09.601 --> 29:10.768
I'll take these.

29:12.371 --> 29:14.772
I was going to take them
to our lab at MCH.

29:14.774 --> 29:17.575
The President's blood is always analyzed
at the Naval hospital.

29:18.944 --> 29:21.912
- Of course.
- We'll send you the results.

29:21.914 --> 29:23.481
Thank you.

29:24.549 --> 29:25.983
I'll need the trash as well.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.355
All traces of the President's
DNA are safeguarded.

29:31.357 --> 29:33.155
For national security reasons.

29:43.001 --> 29:44.401
You going somewhere?

29:45.603 --> 29:47.371
I was looking for you earlier.

29:47.373 --> 29:50.239
Really? Did you call?

29:50.241 --> 29:52.008
Text?

29:52.010 --> 29:54.310
How exactly were
you looking for me?

29:54.312 --> 29:56.913
- Well, uh...
- So.

29:56.915 --> 29:59.281
What happened with our problem?

29:59.283 --> 30:01.584
It's under control.

30:01.586 --> 30:03.152
Does that mean it's been eliminated?

30:03.154 --> 30:06.355
Not yet. But it will be.

30:06.357 --> 30:09.091
- So, it's not under control.
- It will be.

30:09.093 --> 30:10.859
Soon.

30:10.861 --> 30:12.061
You have my word.

30:13.530 --> 30:14.730
Good.

30:16.099 --> 30:17.866
Then I guess we have
nothing to worry about.

30:21.103 --> 30:24.072
You're going to the
reception tonight, right?

30:24.074 --> 30:25.674
Yes.

30:25.676 --> 30:27.108
Good.

30:27.110 --> 30:28.376
Afterwards, I want you
to come back to my house,

30:28.378 --> 30:30.812
I'm having a few people over.

30:30.814 --> 30:31.914
Sounds good.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.594
Three times in one day.

31:20.596 --> 31:22.329
You are getting to be a regular, Ellen.

31:22.331 --> 31:23.797
Last request, I promise.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.632
Can I get a workup
on this blood sample?

31:25.634 --> 31:27.000
Is there enough in there?

31:28.636 --> 31:31.871
Hmm. I'll see what I can do.

31:31.873 --> 31:34.007
Great, well I'm going
to take off for the night.

31:34.009 --> 31:36.342
Would you mind
emailing me the results?

31:36.344 --> 31:38.511
Sure. I still have your email.

31:38.513 --> 31:40.814
Actually, the old one got hacked,
long story.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.916
Could you just send it to this one?

31:45.119 --> 31:46.552
- Will do.
- Thank you.

31:56.096 --> 31:57.096
Hey.

31:58.532 --> 31:59.932
Everything okay with your family?

31:59.934 --> 32:01.600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

32:01.602 --> 32:04.536
My wife's phone was stolen and it was
found at the scene of an accident.

32:04.538 --> 32:06.338
- But she's fine.
- Hmm.

32:06.340 --> 32:08.173
Glad to hear that.

32:08.175 --> 32:12.444
The informant we were supposed to meet in
Southeast turned out to be full of crap.

32:12.446 --> 32:14.780
Just an ex-girlfriend
looking to settle a score.

32:16.149 --> 32:18.950
So, I guess we're back to square one.

32:21.754 --> 32:23.555
- I'll let you get that.
- All right.

32:25.791 --> 32:27.025
Yes?

32:36.035 --> 32:37.268
Where do you want to meet?

33:12.136 --> 33:14.104
I'm glad you came, Agent Hoffman.

33:16.174 --> 33:18.075
I have quite a story for you.

33:19.944 --> 33:22.112
Mr. Creasy.

33:22.114 --> 33:23.580
Quite the surprise.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.305
Lift up your shirt.

33:35.307 --> 33:36.639
Excuse me?

33:36.641 --> 33:38.475
This is 100% off the record.

33:39.776 --> 33:42.078
I don't want any wires
or recording devices.

33:51.388 --> 33:52.788
Pockets.

34:11.908 --> 34:13.975
The President's going
to be assassinated.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.879
Everything is in place.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.715
The wheels are already in motion.

34:22.918 --> 34:24.217
How do you know?

34:25.788 --> 34:27.321
Because I'm involved.

34:29.091 --> 34:31.893
I can get you all the details.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.862
But I want a deal.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.864
You want a deal
for committing treason?

34:35.866 --> 34:38.600
I'm saving the President's life.

34:38.601 --> 34:42.803
Without me,
Paul Kincaid is a dead man.

34:42.804 --> 34:46.107
I want full immunity from
Federal and State prosecution.

34:47.809 --> 34:50.078
And $5,000,000 cash.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.179
Cash?

34:53.681 --> 34:55.283
I'll need to disappear.

34:55.284 --> 34:58.418
I think the witness protection
program will be a more viable...

34:58.420 --> 34:59.486
Not for me.

35:00.956 --> 35:06.259
The people behind this
are extremely powerful.

35:06.261 --> 35:10.163
If I don't hear from you in
five hours, I'll be on a plane.

35:10.165 --> 35:12.833
And you and your colleagues will
be running around like Chihuahuas

35:12.835 --> 35:15.935
trying to figure out who just killed
the President of the United States.

35:15.937 --> 35:18.171
- Let me talk to a Federal prosecutor...
- No.

35:19.440 --> 35:22.075
Go straight to the Attorney General.

35:22.077 --> 35:24.377
He's the only one who
can make this deal.

35:24.379 --> 35:26.012
And he's the only one I trust.

35:50.970 --> 35:53.104
Good to see you, Quentin.

35:53.106 --> 35:54.105
Colonel.

35:55.374 --> 35:57.875
You missed the Dutch Ambassador's
opening remarks.

35:57.877 --> 35:59.544
Shame.

35:59.546 --> 36:01.279
Well, why do you think I came late?

36:03.215 --> 36:05.650
You shouldn't look so serious, Quentin.

36:05.652 --> 36:07.385
Everything's going to be fine.

36:07.387 --> 36:09.353
Oh, I'm not worried.

36:09.355 --> 36:10.855
Good.

36:10.857 --> 36:13.290
Drink up. Enjoy.

36:13.292 --> 36:14.725
See you later tonight.

36:17.428 --> 36:21.498
So, you got this guy Kramer
wrapped around your finger.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.467
He's a good guy, relax.

36:23.469 --> 36:26.069
You think it's really smart
getting involved with him?

36:26.071 --> 36:27.204
Right now?

36:28.273 --> 36:30.707
Smart? No.

36:30.709 --> 36:32.643
But since when is that the criteria?

36:34.779 --> 36:37.113
Well, you're a big girl.
You can do what you want.

36:37.115 --> 36:39.316
As long as I'm not on
the wrong end of it.

36:39.318 --> 36:41.117
What are you talking about?

36:41.119 --> 36:44.020
In spite of what your boyfriend
says, this limo driver thing...

36:44.022 --> 36:45.722
It isn't over.

36:45.724 --> 36:47.123
Not your problem.

36:47.125 --> 36:50.326
Sure it is.
'Cause if they go for him, or you,

36:50.328 --> 36:52.729
that puts all of us at risk.

36:52.731 --> 36:54.463
Just like the missing nurse.

36:54.465 --> 36:57.433
Difference is, I know
how to keep my mouth shut.

37:01.171 --> 37:03.005
Are you saying you don't trust me?

37:04.874 --> 37:07.910
When it comes to cutting
a deal on a murder rap,

37:07.912 --> 37:10.513
I don't trust my own mother.

37:10.515 --> 37:11.847
And I love that lady to death.

37:25.228 --> 37:26.461
No, thank you.

37:32.101 --> 37:34.202
I always love
these cocktail receptions,

37:34.204 --> 37:36.871
all the scintillating chit chat
and the rumors.

37:37.906 --> 37:39.574
You know me.

37:39.576 --> 37:43.311
The more vapid the conversation,
the more I enjoy it.

37:43.313 --> 37:45.547
Don't go. Not yet.

37:45.549 --> 37:47.682
There's something I want to say to you.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.785
Pardon me?
I've always liked you.

37:51.887 --> 37:53.554
Despite our issues.

37:54.990 --> 37:57.391
Thank you. I appreciate that.

37:58.660 --> 38:00.694
You read the Bible, Quentin?

38:02.931 --> 38:05.031
You know, Moses.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.668
He led his people all the way
to the promised land,

38:07.670 --> 38:10.103
but he never set foot in it.

38:11.473 --> 38:13.440
Sorry.

38:13.442 --> 38:14.908
I'm not a religious man.

38:16.077 --> 38:17.411
We will succeed.

38:19.013 --> 38:20.314
In the end.

38:29.157 --> 38:30.523
Like I said, Quentin.

38:31.859 --> 38:33.093
I'm sorry.

39:06.026 --> 39:07.159
Is he okay?

39:07.161 --> 39:08.527
What happened?

39:12.131 --> 39:13.198
Quentin, are you all right?

39:13.200 --> 39:14.333
He's not breathing!

39:14.335 --> 39:15.634
Call a doctor.

39:24.243 --> 39:26.778
There's been an accident.

39:26.780 --> 39:29.547
The Chief of Staff
has suffered a heart attack.

39:29.549 --> 39:31.049
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:35.321 --> 39:37.188
You wanted to see me?

39:37.190 --> 39:41.192
Yeah. I need you to drive me to the
Attorney General's office right away.

39:41.194 --> 39:42.693
What's this all about?

39:42.695 --> 39:45.195
I need to deliver these files in person.

39:45.197 --> 39:47.365
I also need somebody
to watch my back.

39:50.235 --> 39:52.903
- I'll explain more on the way.
- Fair enough.

40:05.183 --> 40:07.717
- Why are we stopping?
- I think we have a flat tire.

40:32.543 --> 40:33.776
You need a hand?

42:00.327 --> 42:02.328
I ran a test on the President's blood.

42:05.700 --> 42:08.267
He and your wife both share the same,

42:09.937 --> 42:11.805
very rare,

42:11.807 --> 42:13.039
blood type.

42:14.475 --> 42:16.909
His bone marrow
is the perfect match for her.

42:18.845 --> 42:20.313
I'm aware of that.

42:23.617 --> 42:26.419
She's the President's daughter,
isn't she?

42:29.856 --> 42:30.923
Yes.

42:33.593 --> 42:36.186
Why don't you just ask him
for the bone marrow,

42:36.198 --> 42:37.954
why do you have to kill him?

42:37.989 --> 42:39.765
Because he doesn't know she's alive.

42:41.267 --> 42:43.561
If he did...

42:44.604 --> 42:47.011
he'd kill her.
