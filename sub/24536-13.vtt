00:00.190 --> 00:02.190
Previously on The Originals...

00:02.190 --> 00:04.980
I need your help, Caroline.
Hope is dying.

00:04.980 --> 00:06.520
She consumed the dark magic,

00:06.520 --> 00:07.900
<i>and now it's consuming her.</i>

00:07.900 --> 00:09.730
She won't survive
tonight's full moon.

00:09.730 --> 00:10.810
She triggered her curse?

00:10.810 --> 00:12.520
<i>I need your daughters.</i>

00:12.520 --> 00:14.690
They're siphoner witches.
It's what they were born to do.

00:14.690 --> 00:18.140
Siphon magic from one thing...
And put it in another.

00:18.140 --> 00:19.020
When you're mid-transformation,

00:19.020 --> 00:20.690
<i>the Saltzman girls will be able</i>

00:20.690 --> 00:22.400
<i>to siphon the magic out of you.</i>

00:22.400 --> 00:23.270
Are you sure about this?

00:23.270 --> 00:24.810
I'll dispose of the magic later.

00:24.810 --> 00:26.810
After they siphon it from Hope,

00:26.810 --> 00:28.270
what are they supposed
to do with it?

00:28.270 --> 00:30.230
They'll put it in me.
When the power is in me,

00:30.230 --> 00:32.140
<i>there's only one way</i>

00:32.140 --> 00:33.520
to make sure it's gone for good.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.140
Someone needs to kill me.

00:35.140 --> 00:37.100
<i>Niklaus.</i>

00:38.190 --> 00:39.270
Don't.

00:40.730 --> 00:42.140
Put it down.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.900
Walk away, Elijah.
You shouldn't be here for this.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.560
Put it down and let's talk.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.980
There's nothing left to say.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.560
It's time to end this chapter,

00:48.560 --> 00:50.100
get rid of the dark magic
once and for all.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.600
Dad?

00:52.980 --> 00:54.560
What's going on here?

00:56.440 --> 00:58.900
Get her out of here.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.350
Your death is not the answer.
Death?

01:01.350 --> 01:04.810
Wh-What are you talking about?

01:04.810 --> 01:07.690
They put it into you.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.690
But you told me that they put it
into something safe,

01:11.690 --> 01:14.560
and instead, you use
my first transition to trick me.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.560
So what happens,

01:16.560 --> 01:19.140
you just kill yourself
and the magic goes away?

01:20.810 --> 01:23.020
And you're gonna let him go
through with this? I don't need

01:23.020 --> 01:24.730
his permission
to save your life!

01:24.730 --> 01:26.640
Come back with me
to New Orleans, Niklaus.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.560
We'll find another way. We both
know that's not gonna happen.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.480
I'm sorry, Hope.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.640
I've made my decision.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.600
And I've made mine.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.690
<i>Just when I thought
he was showing</i>

01:53.690 --> 01:55.440
<i>the vaguest signs of maturity,</i>

01:55.440 --> 01:59.100
our brother makes a
unilateral decision

01:59.100 --> 02:00.850
that leaves the rest of us
stewing in his melodrama.

02:00.850 --> 02:03.640
His death is not a melodrama.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.310
Well, he's spiraling.

02:05.310 --> 02:07.560
This energy feeds on anger,
and our brother... as we know...

02:07.560 --> 02:09.560
Has enough to set
the world on fire.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.230
How many times
are we going to play this game?

02:11.230 --> 02:13.480
Right, calamity and doom
approaches our brother,

02:13.480 --> 02:15.480
and then, all of a sudden,
a trapdoor appears and,

02:15.480 --> 02:16.850
poof, he escapes.

02:18.190 --> 02:20.190
He's a cockroach
that will outlive us all.

02:20.190 --> 02:21.690
And we're immortal.

02:21.690 --> 02:24.270
And what if
it's different this time?

02:24.270 --> 02:26.690
What if he figures out
a way to end it all?

02:26.690 --> 02:28.980
I don't think
he would notice or care

02:28.980 --> 02:30.980
that I wasn't there
to witness it.

02:30.980 --> 02:33.230
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going home.

02:35.730 --> 02:38.060
He'll be back.

02:38.060 --> 02:40.270
Will he?

02:45.190 --> 02:48.060
<i>Your dad is strong,</i>

02:48.060 --> 02:49.600
but that works against him here.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.020
The energy will feed

02:52.020 --> 02:55.140
off of that strength.
He'll quickly go mad, and...

02:55.140 --> 02:57.230
it won't be long
before he's unrecognizable

02:57.230 --> 03:00.230
and impossibly dangerous
to all of us.

03:02.730 --> 03:04.730
Okay. Well,
how long does that take?

03:04.730 --> 03:06.350
Days?

03:08.190 --> 03:11.440
More like... hours.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.980
So, today?

03:14.980 --> 03:16.980
Yeah.

03:20.230 --> 03:23.230
All right. Then we're gonna have
to pull the darkness out of him,

03:23.230 --> 03:24.400
divide it up again.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.400
And then we end up
where we started,

03:26.400 --> 03:28.690
with the family scattered
to the corners of the world

03:28.690 --> 03:31.350
until something calls them back.
Well,

03:31.350 --> 03:32.810
then we keep him asleep, okay?

03:32.810 --> 03:34.060
He won't be angry
when he's asleep.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.440
We'll just brick him up
in the Head Garden.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.690
That'll at least slow it down.

03:38.690 --> 03:41.310
I need you to hear me
on this, Hope.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.230
There's not enough magic
in the world

03:46.230 --> 03:48.060
to slow this down.

03:55.850 --> 03:58.850
Wake up, boy.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.060
Wake... up.

04:04.060 --> 04:05.980
Now.

04:12.980 --> 04:15.230
Put down by your own daughter.

04:15.230 --> 04:17.640
You are a waste

04:17.640 --> 04:19.980
and yet another
stain on my legacy.

04:19.980 --> 04:21.730
Shut your damn mouth.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.730
Don't, Klaus.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.020
He's just trying to bait you.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.810
Camille?

04:30.810 --> 04:32.520
What are you doing here?

04:33.690 --> 04:37.230
Could you be more... pathetic?

04:37.230 --> 04:38.230
Get on your feet, son!

04:39.980 --> 04:41.140
Find your daughter

04:41.140 --> 04:43.440
and show her how we dole out

04:43.440 --> 04:45.020
discipline in this family!

04:45.020 --> 04:48.100
Don't talk about my daughter.

04:53.270 --> 04:57.600
Perhaps you should have followed
your first instincts.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.770
You should've murdered that girl
before she was ever born.

05:00.770 --> 05:05.270
She's the single reason
for your feeble state.

05:05.270 --> 05:07.100
Come on, boy.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.980
The girl is right upstairs.

05:10.980 --> 05:12.810
Kill her.

05:12.810 --> 05:15.350
Kill your daughter.

05:15.350 --> 05:18.190
It's the only way
to make it right.

05:18.190 --> 05:21.100
Don't listen to him, Klaus.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.350
You need to get out of here.

05:22.350 --> 05:25.560
Run. Just... run.

05:42.020 --> 05:43.600
Get out of the way!

05:43.600 --> 05:46.900
Not a chance in hell.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.480
So it's true.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.230
We have to find him.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.270
It's Mardi Gras out there.
The streets'll be packed

05:57.270 --> 05:59.020
to the rafters.

05:59.020 --> 06:02.230
Well, he'll be the one foaming
at the mouth and ranting.

06:02.230 --> 06:03.400
Yeah, exactly.
Which is why I don't think

06:03.400 --> 06:05.060
it's such a good idea
for you to be out there.

06:05.060 --> 06:08.230
It's better
than being fatherless.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.810
Hey, Hope. Hope.

06:31.810 --> 06:33.310
Come on, Hope.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.020
We both know firsthand
what he's up against.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.560
The voices, the rage.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.270
He's in this mess
because he's trying to save me.

06:38.270 --> 06:40.730
Just like always. Look, you
put him down, he got back up.

06:40.730 --> 06:42.480
You put him down again,
the same thing's gonna happen.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.020
So, what, I'm an orphan at 15?

06:45.020 --> 06:47.770
God, you guys are always saying that
I need someone to take care of me.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.600
Well, who's gonna take care
of me if he goes?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.100
Uncle Elijah?

06:51.100 --> 06:52.270
You?

06:52.270 --> 06:54.520
No, of course not.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.230
Because you have your own
never-ending life to live.

06:56.230 --> 06:57.640
So, Marcel, just go

06:57.640 --> 06:59.560
and let me have my last moments
with my father.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.230
Hope!

07:07.230 --> 07:09.230
It's as if
he's everywhere and nowhere

07:09.230 --> 07:10.900
at the same time.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.980
There's death all around him.

07:12.980 --> 07:16.020
I should've taken the power
when I had the chance.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.440
I'll look for a spell
to ease his pain.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.400
But first we have to find him.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.480
This isn't your fault, Elijah.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.140
All I have ever wanted

07:26.140 --> 07:29.560
was to silence
my brother's shame and despair.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.440
If Niklaus destroys himself

07:33.440 --> 07:37.640
in a rampage of torment
and bloodshed, we will...

07:41.480 --> 07:43.850
He can't die like this.

07:43.850 --> 07:46.690
I won't allow it.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.980
He's in the Quarter.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.520
The dark magic
is all around him.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.440
Dad.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.520
Come on.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.980
Let's go home.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.560
Kill her.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.770
Do it, boy.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.060
Kill your daughter.

08:26.060 --> 08:28.810
It's the only way
to make it right.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.809
I know your heart, Klaus.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.309
You're so much better than this.

08:52.310 --> 08:55.310
You once had a blue binder
with a raven on the side.

08:55.310 --> 08:57.190
Where is it?

08:57.190 --> 08:59.190
We've searched for this.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.600
And this is just one of those
things that's not fixable.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.100
Ivy once told me
of a cycling spell.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.100
And I thought I could use it
to offload

09:06.100 --> 09:07.940
some of the darkness
onto someone else.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.940
You know, it's-it's temporary,

09:09.940 --> 09:14.140
but... I thought it could
clear Klaus's mind enough

09:14.140 --> 09:17.140
so that he might enjoy
his last moments.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.140
Huh.

09:23.350 --> 09:26.350
Why are you packing
your stuff into boxes?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.600
Freya.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.440
I need a clean slate.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.690
I'm leaving New Orleans.

09:40.230 --> 09:41.980
For how long?

09:41.980 --> 09:44.190
For good, Freya.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.060
Okay.

09:49.060 --> 09:51.230
Well, then, I need
to tell you something.

09:51.230 --> 09:54.480
And I know that right now is
not exactly the right moment,

09:54.480 --> 09:56.810
and I was going to wait
for Keelin to get back

09:56.810 --> 09:59.600
from the lake house,
but if you're really leaving...

10:01.230 --> 10:03.140
After a lot of talk,

10:03.140 --> 10:05.850
we decided to start a family.

10:05.850 --> 10:09.640
And we wanted someone

10:09.640 --> 10:11.310
who we really cared about

10:11.310 --> 10:13.140
and respected

10:13.140 --> 10:15.270
to be the father of our child.

10:16.730 --> 10:19.640
Now, don't say
anything right now.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.060
Freya.
Okay, just, think about it.

10:21.060 --> 10:22.270
Freya.

10:22.270 --> 10:23.770
Just let the idea wash over you,

10:23.770 --> 10:26.230
and just really consider it.
Freya.

10:29.810 --> 10:32.190
Blue binder, raven on the side.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.690
This is, this is it.

10:34.690 --> 10:36.480
We're not done talking.

10:39.310 --> 10:40.730
You're lucky I didn't turn you

10:40.730 --> 10:42.310
into the world's
blondest roadkill.

10:42.310 --> 10:43.600
And you're lucky I
didn't crush your car

10:43.600 --> 10:45.310
like a toy, you selfish prat.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.770
Our brother needs us and you
scamper off like a rodent.

10:47.770 --> 10:48.980
Oh, you're one to talk.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.230
Shouldn't you be planning

10:50.230 --> 10:52.190
your next epic jilt
of dear Marcel?

10:52.190 --> 10:53.690
You know, happiness

10:53.690 --> 10:55.980
is a choice you're
incapable of accepting.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.350
Go to hell, Kol.

10:58.350 --> 11:00.230
No, dear sister.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.400
I'm going home
to the woman I love,

11:02.400 --> 11:03.850
instead of wallowing
in this toxic,

11:03.850 --> 11:05.480
codependent nightmare
we call family.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.020
You know, that man

11:07.020 --> 11:09.640
has daggered us more times
than can be counted.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.560
So if this is Niklaus's way

11:11.560 --> 11:13.690
of finally biting the big one,

11:13.690 --> 11:14.900
we should be celebrating.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.100
What I'm celebrating

11:16.100 --> 11:17.850
is the fact that he has matured.

11:17.850 --> 11:19.640
For once in his
narcissistic life,

11:19.640 --> 11:21.350
he's doing something
for the rest of us.

11:21.350 --> 11:23.270
If we turn our backs on him now,

11:23.270 --> 11:25.770
then we are no better than
the monster he's been to us.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.310
I never said I was better.

11:28.810 --> 11:31.270
You all bought in
to always and forever.

11:31.270 --> 11:33.350
I didn't.

11:33.350 --> 11:36.400
You really don't care?

11:36.400 --> 11:38.230
I don't.

11:40.350 --> 11:44.020
Then you are even less of a man
than I thought you were.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.480
What have you done?

13:03.480 --> 13:07.350
What I've always done.

13:07.350 --> 13:09.730
Followed you into the fire.

13:12.140 --> 13:13.850
Freya channeled some of
the dark energy into me.

13:13.850 --> 13:15.270
It won't last for long.

13:15.270 --> 13:16.730
It should clear your mind,
though.

13:16.730 --> 13:20.310
Sentimental fool.

13:20.310 --> 13:21.940
Give me back the stake.

13:21.940 --> 13:24.100
In good time.

13:27.060 --> 13:31.310
Niklaus, if indeed
this is to be the end,

13:31.310 --> 13:35.140
you owe it to your family,
to your daughter...

13:35.140 --> 13:37.230
to say good-bye.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.440
Please, don't lecture me,
Elijah.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.980
You have no idea the agony
of being a father,

13:45.980 --> 13:48.020
of loving someone so much

13:48.020 --> 13:49.850
you cannot bear to see them
in pain.

13:49.850 --> 13:52.980
I think I might have some idea.

13:57.310 --> 13:59.850
You've tried to
orchestrate my life,

13:59.850 --> 14:02.060
to make me a better man,

14:02.060 --> 14:04.980
and for that, I honor you.

14:08.690 --> 14:11.140
You have to let me
do this my way.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.560
Alone.

14:14.350 --> 14:15.900
No good-byes.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.060
I could stop you.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.810
You could try.

14:24.310 --> 14:28.560
Please. This last time.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.270
Let me be.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.270
Don't make me murder you

15:11.270 --> 15:13.600
while you contemplate
killing yourself.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.730
Caroline.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.940
If you're here to stop me,
then...

15:18.940 --> 15:23.350
I am here to collect a debt.

15:23.350 --> 15:26.190
Caroline, I'm standing in one

15:26.190 --> 15:28.310
of my favorite places
in the world,

15:28.310 --> 15:31.640
surrounded by food, music,
art, culture.

15:31.640 --> 15:36.480
And all I can think about is how
much I want to show it to you.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.560
Maybe one day you'll let me.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.520
You saved it.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.020
You owe me a tour.

15:44.020 --> 15:47.400
<i>Freya, I know that
you're upset about Klaus.</i>

15:47.400 --> 15:49.020
But that doesn't mean
that you should

15:49.020 --> 15:50.600
go around making rash decisions.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.980
I get it.

15:51.980 --> 15:53.560
Okay? I get you're afraid.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.310
Yes, Freya, I'm afraid.

15:55.310 --> 15:57.520
I am afraid because
I've been here before.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.980
I've been right
there on the verge

15:58.980 --> 16:00.400
of starting something
new for myself

16:00.400 --> 16:01.850
and it never works out for me.

16:01.850 --> 16:04.310
And you can't tell me
that you're not afraid.

16:04.310 --> 16:06.190
You mean to tell me
you're not absolutely terrified

16:06.190 --> 16:07.600
of bringing a kid
into this world?

16:07.600 --> 16:08.770
Into this city?

16:08.770 --> 16:09.940
This child will be different.

16:09.940 --> 16:13.400
A kid with a pack and a coven

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
who can maybe see the world

16:15.400 --> 16:17.640
with more compassion
and understanding.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.520
I want a better future, Vincent.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.100
I want it with Keelin
and I want it with you.

16:23.100 --> 16:25.190
We're family.

16:27.230 --> 16:29.400
Freya, sometimes family means

16:29.400 --> 16:31.850
telling someone
whom you love no.

16:31.850 --> 16:33.940
I've lost too many people.

16:33.940 --> 16:35.440
I've hurt too many people.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.400
And that is a curse
that I refuse

16:37.400 --> 16:39.310
to pass on to
another generation.

16:39.310 --> 16:41.980
I'm sorry. No.

16:41.980 --> 16:43.600
You're gonna have to
choose somebody else.

16:57.730 --> 16:59.770
I have three brothers.

16:59.770 --> 17:05.400
One's dying, one's a deserter
and one's an enabling mess.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.640
Mikaelsons have
always been complicated.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.060
You got to wonder what that says

17:11.060 --> 17:15.020
about me, that I fought so hard
to be one of you.

17:17.690 --> 17:20.349
My heart is breaking.

17:20.349 --> 17:24.770
Because, despite everything,

17:24.770 --> 17:26.770
they're family

17:26.770 --> 17:29.020
and you love them.

17:32.270 --> 17:34.350
And so do I.

17:40.270 --> 17:42.230
The little fool is right.

17:42.230 --> 17:44.690
Which fool?

17:44.690 --> 17:47.020
Kol.

17:49.690 --> 17:53.230
Happiness is a choice.

18:14.940 --> 18:17.690
Would you even be here

18:17.690 --> 18:21.600
if I had longer to live?

18:21.600 --> 18:25.400
Maybe I'd let you chase me
around for a few more centuries.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.810
That was always the
fun part anyway.

18:35.060 --> 18:38.100
Say good-bye to your
daughter, Klaus.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.730
Give her real closure.

18:40.730 --> 18:43.140
Closure is a myth.

18:43.140 --> 18:45.900
Look, what you're
doing is noble, Klaus,

18:45.900 --> 18:48.230
but if you don't say good-bye,

18:48.230 --> 18:51.020
if-if you leave Hope
with questions

18:51.020 --> 18:53.810
and pain and anger,

18:53.810 --> 18:56.400
you'll haunt her.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.980
And I don't think
that's your endgame.

19:05.560 --> 19:09.640
I don't know how
to say good-bye.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.600
Try this.

19:19.270 --> 19:21.270
One of you stands,

19:21.270 --> 19:25.020
walks to the door,
but doesn't turn back,

19:25.020 --> 19:28.060
even if their heart aches

19:28.060 --> 19:33.230
for just one more look,
one more moment.

19:33.230 --> 19:37.640
But you'll know that
the not looking...

19:37.640 --> 19:39.690
just means...

19:42.020 --> 19:46.100
I'll
never forget you.

20:33.270 --> 20:35.230
<i>He left instead of spending</i>

20:35.230 --> 20:37.140
<i>his last hours with me.</i>

20:37.140 --> 20:40.440
He's hurt and he's scared.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.480
That's no excuse.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.020
Not making excuses.

20:44.020 --> 20:47.440
If anything, he cares too much.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.060
Hope, you're his everything.

20:50.060 --> 20:53.560
And without you, he wouldn't
be making this sacrifice.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.730
Do you understand
you've accomplished

20:55.730 --> 20:58.940
in 15 years what I couldn't in a thousand?

20:58.940 --> 21:02.900
This isn't abandonment.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.480
He's afraid.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.060
I'd like a moment alone
with my daughter, please.

21:19.310 --> 21:21.520
Of course.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.520
Hope, please, scream, yell,

21:43.520 --> 21:45.140
break something if you have to.

21:45.140 --> 21:47.730
Just don't look at me like that.

21:47.730 --> 21:51.230
This isn't right.

21:51.230 --> 21:52.520
A father protecting
his daughter...

21:52.520 --> 21:54.140
I'd say that's exactly right.

21:54.140 --> 21:56.230
Elijah was willing
to take the curse completely.

21:56.230 --> 21:57.690
And what kind of father
allows another man

21:57.690 --> 21:59.770
to die for his child?
The kind that loves her.

21:59.770 --> 22:02.020
<i>I </i> love you.

22:03.020 --> 22:05.020
I love you.

22:05.020 --> 22:08.730
It's the way of the world.

22:08.730 --> 22:10.140
Children bury their parents.

22:10.140 --> 22:12.190
It happens every day,
every hour.

22:12.190 --> 22:14.480
It's a truth this family
has avoided at a cost.

22:14.480 --> 22:19.020
Yeah, well, I just got you back,
so why does it have to be today?

22:26.980 --> 22:28.980
Listen...

22:31.520 --> 22:35.940
I have not lived an honorable
life, you know that.

22:35.940 --> 22:38.900
But doing this...

22:38.900 --> 22:41.020
Taking the darkness into myself

22:41.020 --> 22:42.810
so no one else
is afflicted by it...

22:42.810 --> 22:46.270
That is an honorable death,
and I can do that. I can do it,

22:46.270 --> 22:49.980
Hope...

22:49.980 --> 22:53.400
because you've helped me
feel something

22:53.400 --> 22:55.560
that I never thought
was possible.

22:59.810 --> 23:02.230
Unconditional love.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.310
My daughter.

23:10.310 --> 23:12.190
My heir.

23:16.230 --> 23:18.600
You're my heart.

23:26.060 --> 23:28.980
Remember when
he stopped sleeping?

23:28.980 --> 23:31.560
He was so paranoid someone was
plotting against him,

23:31.560 --> 23:36.140
he would wander the halls at
night listening at our doors.

23:36.140 --> 23:39.600
That night that he almost caught
me sneaking out of your room...

23:41.440 --> 23:43.690
I think I was hiding in that
crawl space for about 12 hours.

23:49.560 --> 23:53.190
Um, Keelin just got back.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.230
Just wanted to say hi.

23:55.230 --> 23:58.440
Hi.
Hi.

24:01.850 --> 24:04.310
You know, he
always had a prescient eye.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.190
He was extolling the
virtues of Vincent van Gogh

24:07.190 --> 24:11.480
when the world decided he was a
madman with a severed ear. Wait.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.270
Do you remember
that April Fool's in Copenhagen

24:13.270 --> 24:16.020
where he compelled a circus
troupe to follow you around?

24:16.020 --> 24:17.310
Also known as

24:17.310 --> 24:19.020
the most challenging 36 hours
of my long life.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.310
No, no, no, no, no.

24:20.310 --> 24:22.730
The worst was when
he would get drunk,

24:22.730 --> 24:24.520
and get it in his head
that he was gonna

24:24.520 --> 24:26.850
set the world ablaze
with his paintings.

24:26.850 --> 24:28.560
And then he would actually
set them on fire.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.230
That was the weird thing.

24:30.230 --> 24:31.850
What was his phrase? His, uh...

24:31.850 --> 24:34.560
His inspirational rampages.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.060
His drunken collection

24:37.060 --> 24:38.940
was always my favorite.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.980
I should have known
this was going to be redundant.

24:46.980 --> 24:50.060
Brother...

24:50.060 --> 24:54.100
bourbon's never redundant.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.480
The prodigal brother returns.

24:56.480 --> 25:01.020
Yes, well, as much as I hate
to admit it, you were right.

25:01.020 --> 25:04.100
We should honor
our brother's sacrifice.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.440
And if Nik's time is up, then,
I guess I didn't want to miss

25:06.440 --> 25:08.230
my chance to bitch and moan.

25:08.230 --> 25:10.730
Because he is a tremendous ass.

25:10.730 --> 25:13.560
That he is.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.900
But he oh-so-secretly adores
his youngest brother.

25:28.690 --> 25:31.560
Well, don't stop on my account.

25:31.560 --> 25:36.400
If this is to be my funeral,
then, let's get on with it.

25:43.730 --> 25:45.560
Stop. Stop it.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.190
Ah, sorry...

26:07.020 --> 26:08.400
Wait, wait, wait... Stop it.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.140
I will never abandon you.

26:45.140 --> 26:47.440
And even though
I can't always be around,

26:47.440 --> 26:49.400
if you so much as breathe my name...
Thank you.

26:51.940 --> 26:53.940
All right.

26:53.940 --> 26:57.560
It's time for an old-fashioned
wish burning ceremony.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.020
You know, as much
as I've savored the joy

27:33.020 --> 27:36.440
of tormenting you
throughout the years,

27:36.440 --> 27:40.640
I must confess you all mean
everything to me.

27:40.640 --> 27:45.310
Your loyalty and your counsel

27:45.310 --> 27:48.940
and your love...

27:48.940 --> 27:53.770
is probably the only reason why
I've survived as long as I have.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.640
Which is how I know...

28:02.980 --> 28:05.480
long after I'm gone...

28:07.730 --> 28:12.270
you will all come together,
time and time again,

28:12.270 --> 28:16.100
to take care of each other.

28:20.140 --> 28:23.020
And that is why
I'm not afraid...

28:25.730 --> 28:28.140
for your future.

28:30.980 --> 28:34.520
We're bound forever to those
with whom we share blood.

28:36.850 --> 28:38.350
And while we may not
choose our family...

28:41.640 --> 28:44.900
that bond is our greatest strength.

28:50.810 --> 28:54.190
Though I may be
leaving you tonight...

28:56.520 --> 29:01.520
this is not the end
of the Mikaelsons.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.560
Always and forever.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.900
Always and forever.

29:21.980 --> 29:23.980
I need a moment.

29:37.980 --> 29:41.140
There's something else
we need to discuss.

29:41.140 --> 29:42.770
I want to go with you.

29:42.770 --> 29:44.440
I don't think you should.

29:49.060 --> 29:51.060
I'm gonna make you proud.

29:51.060 --> 29:54.690
I can't promise that I
won't go through a period

29:54.690 --> 30:00.270
where I get irresponsible
tattoos and date older men,

30:00.270 --> 30:04.100
but I'm gonna go back to school.

30:04.100 --> 30:08.480
And I'll be okay.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.520
Because I'm a Mikaelson.

30:14.440 --> 30:19.020
And I promise you,
I'm gonna do right by our name.

30:19.020 --> 30:21.640
I know you will.

30:24.440 --> 30:27.100
I love you...

30:28.520 --> 30:32.400
more than all
the days and nights,

30:32.400 --> 30:35.900
deeper than the oceans
and the skies.

30:37.140 --> 30:40.400
I love you, too.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.400
How do we do this?

30:52.900 --> 30:54.940
I wish I knew.

31:08.230 --> 31:10.980
Ah, this old chestnut.

31:12.980 --> 31:15.400
Many moons ago, we sat here

31:15.400 --> 31:18.640
and discussed
the future of our family.

31:23.940 --> 31:28.560
I never should have got in the
way of your happiness, Rebekah.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.520
You don't have to apologize.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.560
Well, then, let me
make it up to you.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.900
I've asked Caroline
to get you the cure.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.140
In a handful of decades
when it's time,

31:39.140 --> 31:41.020
you can go to Mystic Falls
and get it.

31:41.020 --> 31:43.400
Then if you no longer wish
to be a vampire,

31:43.400 --> 31:45.060
it's your choice.

31:48.810 --> 31:54.560
Live the life you've always
wanted to live, my sister.

31:56.940 --> 31:59.350
Thank you.

32:33.980 --> 32:38.060
I don't want your last memory
of me to be my death.

32:40.400 --> 32:44.100
So, please, let's not
say the sad good-bye.

32:44.100 --> 32:47.190
I agree.

32:47.190 --> 32:48.980
Let's not.

32:59.770 --> 33:02.140
I hate to disappoint you,
brother,

33:02.140 --> 33:04.640
but the stake will be just as
effective in its shorter form.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.270
I'm aware.

33:06.270 --> 33:09.020
So you plan to hold onto a piece
as a souvenir?

33:22.020 --> 33:24.640
I intend to die by your side.

33:34.770 --> 33:37.230
I'm dying. You're not.

33:37.230 --> 33:38.730
The moment I end, you're free.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.810
Free of what?

33:40.810 --> 33:44.480
Free of the-the
mad king brother.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.600
You can do whatever
your heart desires.

33:46.600 --> 33:49.350
This is my heart's desire.

33:54.230 --> 33:58.060
Niklaus, we didn't choose
to become what we are.

33:58.060 --> 34:03.100
To be or not to be was taken
from us by Esther and Mikael,

34:03.100 --> 34:05.980
stolen from us, Niklaus.

34:05.980 --> 34:09.980
I'm stealing it back.

34:09.980 --> 34:13.690
Brother, tonight,
I truly saw a path.

34:13.690 --> 34:17.270
I saw a vision of a future
for everyone that we love

34:17.270 --> 34:21.139
and then when I looked
at my own future...

34:23.730 --> 34:28.730
The purpose of my life,
my unrelenting desire

34:28.730 --> 34:32.560
has always been your redemption.

34:34.730 --> 34:37.350
And after everything
I've done...

34:39.310 --> 34:43.100
you truly believe
I am redeemed?

34:43.100 --> 34:46.560
Yes, I do.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.900
You're a hypocrite.

34:49.900 --> 34:52.690
You forced me to go through
all those painful good-byes

34:52.690 --> 34:56.810
and then-then you slipped
away without telling a soul.

34:56.810 --> 34:59.440
How well do you know me,
Niklaus?

34:59.440 --> 35:02.060
I told them.

35:02.060 --> 35:07.400
<i>I told them that I was going
to redefine always and forever.</i>

35:07.400 --> 35:10.140
<i>That, uh...</i>

35:10.140 --> 35:15.100
<i>I was going to follow you
from this...</i>

35:15.100 --> 35:18.140
<i>adventure
to whatever lies beyond.</i>

35:30.350 --> 35:33.980
And each of them gave me
their blessing.

35:38.140 --> 35:40.310
What about Hope?
Well,

35:40.310 --> 35:44.140
she'll have Marcel
and Rebekeh and Freya.

35:44.140 --> 35:48.100
I even looked Kol in the eye
and I told him

35:48.100 --> 35:51.690
if he doesn't look after her,
I'll come back and haunt him.

35:57.020 --> 36:01.560
She is the very best of me.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.690
Yes, she is.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.640
Two witches and a werewolf.

37:06.230 --> 37:09.560
This kid's gonna have
one hell of a temper.

37:13.270 --> 37:15.190
Really?

37:15.190 --> 37:18.640
I was staring at my suitcase,
Freya,

37:18.640 --> 37:20.640
and it occurred to me
if that madman,

37:20.640 --> 37:23.400
Klaus Mikaelson,
can find the courage

37:23.400 --> 37:25.940
to sacrifice everything
for his family...

37:25.940 --> 37:29.230
maybe I can find the courage

37:29.230 --> 37:31.940
to deal
with the possibility of loss.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.310
If I'm leaving,
then so are you.

37:52.310 --> 37:54.600
No more vampires.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.230
We're giving the city back.

37:56.230 --> 37:59.270
Train leaves in a couple hours,

37:59.270 --> 38:02.270
so get your last glimpse
of New Orleans,

38:02.270 --> 38:05.850
then get the hell out of Dodge.

38:05.850 --> 38:07.560
You got one for me?

38:16.230 --> 38:20.690
I want to be with you, Marcel.

38:20.690 --> 38:22.350
Do you really?

38:22.350 --> 38:25.190
But there's a catch.

38:25.190 --> 38:28.230
There's always a catch.

38:28.230 --> 38:30.850
There's a cure in Mystic
Falls with my name on it

38:30.850 --> 38:33.350
and I'm going to take it.

38:33.350 --> 38:35.600
I'm going to lead a human life.

38:40.190 --> 38:42.770
Marcel Gerard,

38:42.770 --> 38:48.350
you are my friend,
my partner, my love.

38:48.350 --> 38:52.440
And if you're willing to have me
for the next hundred years

38:52.440 --> 38:56.350
to watch me grow old and gray,

38:56.350 --> 38:59.600
hold my hand
as I take my last breath...

39:02.810 --> 39:05.810
I would very much
like to be your wife.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.810
I do.

40:02.060 --> 40:04.690
What if there's nothing after this?

40:04.690 --> 40:08.560
No peace.

40:08.560 --> 40:12.060
Just darkness.

40:12.060 --> 40:16.100
We face it together.

40:25.810 --> 40:28.850
As always.

40:28.850 --> 40:33.020
I don't deserve the love
you've given me, brother.

40:35.350 --> 40:39.060
But I am so grateful.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.940
It's been a glorious ride,
Niklaus.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.900
And my greatest honor.

40:56.305 --> 41:02.440
