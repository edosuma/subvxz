[people chattering]

5
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,655
[docent] The lore tells us
of a valiant few

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,366
who stood above the fray
and fog.

7
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,952
My, what weapons
they must have wielded.

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,246
Which brings us
to our current exhibit,

9
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,915
the mythical staff of the gods.

10
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,625
In Homer's tale,

11
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,921
the staff was said to harness
the gift of all gods.

12
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,966
Oh. [chuckles]
Welcome, proud soldiers.

13
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,134
What did I say?

14
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,593
Museums are fun.

15
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,555
Amusement parks
for the brains. [laughs]

16
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,307
- Whoa!
- [docent] Okay,

17
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,683
there's no reason to get pushy.

18
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,102
Everyone will get a chance
to see it.

19
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,603
Carved from a heartwood

20
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,106
not seen in over 2,000 years,

21
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,442
the two halves
of this ancient replica

22
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,736
were recently discovered in,
of all places,

23
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,364
a waste processing plant
outside of Philadelphia.

24
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,782
So strong, they reportedly broke

25
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,743
- three trash compactors.
- [thuds]

26
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,037
Okay, um, friends,
that's enough.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,456
I'm, I'm sort of the star
of the show here... [gasps]

28
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,333
- Stop!
- [people murmuring]

29
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,500
Stop! Sir!

30
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,462
Sir!

31
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,882

32
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,342
Hey, what are you doing?

Unleash the chaos.

[gasps]

45
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,574
Unleash the chaos.

52
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,555
[man 2 in English] Wait,
wait. Move, move, move!

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,930
No, no!

54
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,766
[man 3] Help me!

55
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,358
- [grunts]
- [ringing]

56
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,737

[man groans]

58
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,373
No! [panting]

59
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,334
Ladies, please just let me go.

60
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,794
[speaking other language]

61
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,733
[man 5 in English]
Oh, my God! Look out!

62
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,718
[people coughing]

63
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,306

[dramatic music playing]

65
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,887
Turns out museums are fun.

66
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,518
Let's have more of it.

67
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,646
We can do nothing while
the staff remains sundered.

68
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,148
The champions of this realm
outnumber us.

69
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,318
Human champions are still humans

70
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,111
and we are gods.

71
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,031
Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.

72
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,325
To protect the power
of the gods,

73
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,119
he will have chosen
with meticulous precision

74
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,957
the strongest, most keenly
intelligent champions

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,334
this realm has ever witnessed.

76
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm an idiot.

77
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,005
I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.

78
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,757
Like, what am I even
contributing?

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,676
There's already a superhero
with a red suit,

80
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,843
with a lightning bolt on it

81
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,971
and I'm fast, but he's faster.

82
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,724
Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly

83
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,101
and Batman is so cool!

84
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,228
And I'm just me.

85
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,711
And I can't say this
to anyone else,

86
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,249
'cause my family looks to me
as a leader,

87
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,108
but I feel like

88
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,276
a fraud.

89
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,652
You understand I'm a...

90
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,113
pediatrician,

91
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,825
right?

92
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,910
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

93
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,662
by another patient,
Billy Batson.

94
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,038
It doesn't matter.

95
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,873
Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

96
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,834
they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

97
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,335
All right, look.

98
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,980
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

99
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,880
but it sounds to me like

100
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,717
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,012
And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,

102
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,514
so if you don't mind me asking,

103
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,558
how well do you remember
your childhood?

104
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,059
Like it was today. [chuckles]

105
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,937
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

106
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,480
I mean, I never met my dad.

107
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,942
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

108
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,545
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,

109
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,612
ran away from 11 homes,

110
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,904
got into a lot of fights.

111
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,197
Then I was abducted by a wizard

112
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,741
who gave me superpowers

113
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,468
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

114
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,660
That's not a small amount.

115
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,120
A doctor conjured seven demons

116
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,580
and held my whole family
hostage,

117
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,099
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,

118
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,833
and then everybody
got superpowers,

119
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,686
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

120
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,396
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

121
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,340
Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that.

122
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,884
Right?
Rejected by your parents,

123
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,469
then by the system,

124
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,180
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

125
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,848
I never said I was rejected
by my city.

126
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,393
"Rejected by city."

127
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,354
That's the Tribune.
Nobody reads the Tribune.

128
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,106
- I do.
- Anyway, okay, well, um...

129
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,859
I, uh, appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems.

130
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,447
There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so...

131
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,783
- Hostage situation?
- Yeah.

132
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,660

I suck balls at this.

[guns firing in video game]

137
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,713
Why do we always have
to play war games?

138
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,507
Hey, it's practice
for our other job.

139
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,467
- [scoffs]
- I'm serious.

140
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,678
Military strategy,
multiple team members,

141
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,513
each with a special skillset

142
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,890
unleashed against
an unknown enemy.

143
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,558
[Victor] I know how it sounds,

144
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,411
but the house keeps getting
struck by lightning, Leo.

145
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,104
I'm telling you.

146
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,956
Besides, you're the one
always talking about teamwork.

147
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,441
- But we don't need guns!
- [gasps]

148
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,276
[Mary] Darla?

149
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,545
[Freddy] This is it.
This is big time.

150
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,072
- We are the guns.
- [Mary] Darla!

151
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,591
Why were there Skittles
in my pockets?

152
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,701
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

153
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,327
It was.

154
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,079
Hmm, she's very moody lately.

155
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,081
Why do you think
I put Skittles in her pocket?

156
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,333
- Oh.
- [Rosa] Whoo! Ole.

157
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,686
[Victor] Is this an army
of unicorns

158
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,420
- killing Genghis Khan?
- Yes.

159
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,130
Unicorns aren't real.

160
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,340
It's called speculative
history, Eugene. Look it up.

161
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,484
[Eugene] Billy,
you can't just leave.

162
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,176
Your guy's gonna die!

163
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,970
Whoo! [laughs]

- See?
- Yes.

166
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,100
I told you you would get into it

167
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,560
if you gave it a chance.

168
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,854
Yeah, I'm really starting
to see the appeal.

169
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,667
[Billy whispering]
What's going on?

170
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,691

00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,826
Dude, what are you doing?

00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,512
[officer on headphones]
Possible 10-99 in progress.

174
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,013
Multiple reports of cracking
on roadway.

175
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,873
Fraying suspension cables.

176
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,167
All units
to the Ben Franklin Bridge.

177
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,294
Yeah.
It's crazy music, Freddy.

178
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,629
It is, isn't it?
Very urgent melody to it.

179
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,857
We should see it performed live.

180
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,299

I totally get it.

360
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,022
Yeah.

361
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,815
Do you really not see yourself?

362
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,898
[sighs]

363
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,574
You turn 18 in five months.

364
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,909
They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.

365
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,454
Victor and Rosa are saints,
yes, but you're about to age out

366
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,372
of the foster system
just like I did.

367
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,125
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

368
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,208
Do you?

369
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,088
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

370
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,008
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

371
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,093
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

372
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,806
I don't care if Wonder Woman
has a job.

373
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,475
I want to contribute.

374
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,352
At some point, Billy, like

375
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,687
everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or...

376
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
leave home.

377
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,946
Nothing lasts forever.

378
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,497
[door opens, closes]

379
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,875
I mean, it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.

380
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,215
So, clearly, some things
do last forever.

381
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,258
- [ominous music playing]
- [wind blowing]

382
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,402
[footsteps approaching]

383
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,086
[man] Leave me to die.

384
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,423
Oh, but we come bearing gifts.

385
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,843
[magic resonating]

386
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,685
Magic.

387
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,562
Impossible.

388
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,814
This realm was sealed off
from magic.

389
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,485
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

390
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,280
From every god in this realm.

391
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,781
From me.

392
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,576
[bar sizzling]

393
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,870
Do you not remember
what you took?

394
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,831
What my particular power was?

395
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,333
The power of elements.

396
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,004
No. I cast a barrier
to prevent your kind

397
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,006
from entering the human realm.

398
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,258
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if...

399
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,718
Someone broke this?

400
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,929
How did...

401
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,639
Where is the Champion?

402
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,392
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

403
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,769
and yours that will mend it.

404
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,981
I told you
I would die before I help you.

405
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,776
[grunting]

406
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,530
[groaning]

407
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,377
Now, say the word.

408
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,630
Never. Never!

409
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,256
Never say never.

410
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,390
Say the word.

411
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,434
[magical voices echoing]

412
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,776
[magical voices]
Say the word. Say the word.

413
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,320
- Shazam!
- [crackling]

414
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,364
[dramatic music playing]

415
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,409
[magic resonates]

416
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,330
[grunting]

417
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,336
[grunts]

418
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,547
[growls]

419
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,009
[grunts]

420
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,513
[screams]

421
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,725
[grunting]

422
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,144
Now we get to have our fun.

423
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,482
Fun is for children, dear.
We are at war.

424
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,577
[upbeat music playing]

425
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,412
[school bell rings]

426
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,979
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my goodness.

427
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,063
- I am so sorry!
- I'm so sorry!

428
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,463
No, don't be sorry. I'm sorry!

429
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,649
No, it's totally my fault.
Are you okay?

430
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,692
- I'm okay, yeah.
- Okay, yeah.

431
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,342
- I'm always okay.
- Good.

432
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,721
Uh, actually, do you...
do you know where this is?

433
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,964
[voice cracks] Miss Saunders!

434
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,308
[clears throat]
Yeah, absolutely

435
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,952
is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.

436
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,662
Oh, no, no worries. If it
makes you feel any better

437
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:16,913
it's nothing compared
to the amount

438
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,147
that you're blushing right now.

439
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,523
Oh, I blush when I'm confident.

440
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,066
- [chuckles]
- [Brett] There she is.

441
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,277
- Hey.
- New girl. First period.

442
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,529
- [Anne] Yeah.
- I'm Brett. This is Burke.

443
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,323
Listen, if you need anything
at all,

444
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,241
we're your guys. We got it.

445
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,327
[Freddy] Brett and Burke Breyer.

446
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,721
They got it all. I mean, what is it,
narcissistic personality disorder,

447
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,538
- chlamydia, they got it.
- [chuckles]

448
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,498
Plenty of it to go around, too.

449
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,335
This is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid.

450
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,253
Fanboy here thinks
he's a big boy now.

451
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,772
Yeah, he doesn't know
where he belongs.

452
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,399
Sure I do. I don't belong
in that trash can.

453
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,026
'Cause that's... I'll smell
like human garbage,

454
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,970
do you realize that?
And that's your brand, guys!

455
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,803
[grunting]

456
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,263
[Brett] Down goes Freeman.

457
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,473
Hey, hey! Look!

458
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,268
- Now I'm a superhero.
- Nice!

459
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,812
[clearing throat]

460
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,731
What is this thing doing here?

461
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,232
- Janitors.
- [groaning]

462
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,460
[Brett] Get up, man.
What are you doin'?

463
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,818
- Come on.
- [Freddy grunts]

464
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,254
You're gonna want
to get this fixed, huh?

465
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,197
Yeah, that's probably
why you fell.

466
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,782
[Burke] Yeah.
[Brett] Bye, new girl.

467
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,991
Jeez, thanks Mr. Geckle.

468
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,618
Don't sweat it. That trash can

469
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,346
was like a second home to me
when I went here.

470
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,370
[Freddy chuckles]

471
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,207
Hey.

472
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,833
You knew those guys
were gonna hit you,

473
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,752
but you stepped in anyway.

474
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,962
You know something?
That's how I amuse myself.

475
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,255
The funnier I am,

476
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,966
[grunts] the more I get punched.

477
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,259
[both chuckling]

478
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,636
Well, it made me laugh.

479
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:32,846
So...

480
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,727
- [chuckles]
- Hero.

481
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,521
[mouthing]

482
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,150
You gonna walk me to class,
or what?

483
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,544
Why would I...
Walk you to class? No.

484
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,654
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes!

485
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,072
Thanks. [chuckles]

486
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,449
So, from the top.

487
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,661
What is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid?

488
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,748
Yeah. Um, it's real inside
baseball, but basically,

489
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,251
a while ago I happened
to have some lunch

490
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,253
in the cafeteria
with a few superheroes.

491
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,297
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

492
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,716
- That was you?
- Yeah.

493
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,509
And they're still dicks to you?

494
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,028
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

495
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,430
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

496
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,806
You seem pretty cool to me.

497
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,642
[loudly] Freddy!

498
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,063
Is my name.

499
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,858
Sorry, that was weird
and loud. I'm Freddy,

500
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,484
he said in a normal voice.

501
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,568
I'm Anne.

502
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,864
Anne.

503
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,157
- [grunts]
- [chuckles]

504
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,450
- Nice!
- Bullseye.

505
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,118
Hey, you gotta fix
that crutch, bro!

506
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,201
[chuckles]

507
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,121
What?

508
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,204
[sighs]

509
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,459
[chuckles lightly]

510
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,504
[wizard gasping]

511
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,548
[unsettling music playing]

512
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
[grunts]

513
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,442
[groans]

514
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,613
[speaking other language]

515
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:18,577
[in English] Good, little one.
Well done.

516
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,497
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

517
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,667
[captivating music playing]

518
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,597
[cork pops]

519
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,682
Wow. Um... [chuckles]

520
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,602
I'm flattered
that you feel this way.

521
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,522
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

522
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,774
Romantic setting

523
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
and fancy champagne,
big plates, tiny food.

524
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,820
I mean, you went all out.

525
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,948
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

526
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,658
I'm just not sure

527
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,719
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

528
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,287
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

529
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,834
I promise this is
not about you. Okay? Look... [chuckles]

530
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,797
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

531
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,420
You and me.

532
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:14,007
The dynamic duo.
The hottie goddies. [chuckles]

533
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,177
She-zam.

534
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,555
I guess I'm just afraid
that I'm...

535
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,890
gonna let 'em all down.
You know?

536
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,679
That I'm gonna let you down.

537
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,733
You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

538
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:32,985
Let's try this crazy thing.

539
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,319
Maybe we'll, uh...

540
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,575
seal it with a kiss?

541
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,618
[sentimental piano music
playing]

542
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,673
- Billy Batson!
- [Shazam screams]

543
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,967
You are a fool of a champion.

544
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,094
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

545
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,488
What happened
to her beautiful face?

546
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,139
Also, aren't you,
like, dead-ass dead?

547
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,391
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

548
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,393
The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you.

549
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,644
Daughters of Atlas?

550
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,146
They're coming to unmake
your world

551
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,107
and torture mankind
for all eternity

552
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,860
- in the Pit of Endless Agony.
- Okay, I feel like maybe

553
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,045
I should be writing
all this down.

554
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,195
- Quiet!
- Okay, okay.

555
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,197
You don't know what you've done.

556
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,241
I regret ever choosing you.

557
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,951
Because of you,

558
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,054
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

559
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,580
They will be hunting
for you now.

560
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,663
Hunting your family.

561
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,085
[Shazam] Hmm?

562
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,005
Oh, they're coming.
Listen to me, Billy.

563
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,466
The fate of your world
depends on it.

564
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,801
One thing you absolutely
must not allow

565
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,095
the daughters of Atlas
to do is...

566
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,597
- [screams]
- [gasps]

567
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,102
[breathing heavily]

568
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,438
- [mysterious music playing]
- [crackling]

569
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,236
- [shatters]
- [gasps]

570
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,159
Hey, Freddy?

571
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,082
- [dog barking in distance]
- [crickets chirping]

572
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,746
[sighs]

573
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,799
[Freddy] Nope, over it.
Done it.

574
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,134
Check fraud? What,
are you kidding me? [gasps]

575
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,804
Armored car heist?

576
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,139
[chuckles] I think I got that
in the bag.

577
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,016
[rock music playing]

578
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,851
- Shazam!
- [lightning cracks]

579
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,524
Whoo!

580
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,359
[Freddy scoffs]

581
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,238
Bon appetit.

582
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,074
Hi.

583
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,743
- Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
- Hi. [chuckles]

584
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,161
Um, you wanna show me

585
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,038
where you were sitting
when it happened?

586
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,750
Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.

587
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,585
- Yeah. Follow me.
- Okay, yeah.

588
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,879
So, basically,
it's a table down at the end.

589
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,923
[people chattering]

590
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,552
So I was sitting, yeah...

591
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,013
Basically, I was sitting
right here, and he was sitting

592
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,347
right there.

593
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,658
- Here? [chuckles]
- Right there, yeah.

594
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,600
[cell phone vibrates, chimes]

595
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,227
Oh, sorry.
Overbearing brother.

596
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,312
Oh, I have one of those.
Uh, a sister.

597
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,596
Always has to know where I am.

598
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,898
- Right.
- [cell phone chiming]

599
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,334
- I feel that, clearly.
- [chuckles]

600
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,901
Always thinks she knows
better, too.

601
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,504
Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?

602
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,321
Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.

603
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,574
No, of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone...

604
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,451
Constantly breathing
down your neck.

605
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,345
- From the moment you wake up!
- 'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

606
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,747
No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly.

607
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,558
And do we have to do
every single thing together?

608
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,625
[both] No!

609
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,711
- [both chuckle]
- [footsteps approaching]

610
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,880
Oh! Billy! What...

611
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,381
What a coinkidink! Um...

612
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,383
I was just telling
my friend Anne

613
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,261
- what a great guy you are.
- We need to talk.

614
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,904
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

615
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,681
- He's a great talker.
- Freddy.

616
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,975
I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back. -Okay.

617
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,896
Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

618
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,189
The skin peeled off his face.

619
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,066
He turned into a literal
pile of ash.

620
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,234
- Yeah, seems definitive.
- I dunno.

621
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,446
Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams

622
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,007
and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message.

623
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,759
[snaps fingers] Could be
astral projection powers.

624
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,993
- What's that?
- Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

625
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,846
- from the great beyond?
- That's it, I'm calling

626
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,330
an emergency meeting
after school.

627
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,373
- I want you there.
- Where else am I gonna go?

628
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,750
- What?
- Dude.

629
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,877
[Freddy reading indistinctly]

630
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,213
Okay, first of all,
I didn't explode it!

631
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,857
All right? It was already
like that and, and, and...

632
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,317
What is that, the Tribune?
It's fake news!

633
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,801
Freddy, we only have one rule.

634
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,177
[both] All or none.

635
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,613
And it's a stupid rule,
by the way.

636
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,222
I have a girl talking
to me, Billy.

637
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,057
A girl. For the first time
in my life!

638
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,077
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

639
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,727
but I'll never find out

640
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,121
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

641
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,522
Just be at the Rock, Freddy.

642
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,608
[sighs] Okay. Mmm.

643
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,860
By the way, uh,
she has a sister.

644
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,362
Total control freak.

645
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,863
I think you guys
would get along.

646
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,740
Think you'd love her, actually.

647
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,009
[Shazam] Look, look, look. Fam,

648
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,493
I know it sounds crazy.

649
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,203
And, and obviously I don't know

650
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,205
exactly what this all means

651
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,873
but, but he was super aggro

652
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,976
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

653
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,460
He was yelling about all this

654
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,021
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

655
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,631
Do you have to talk so loud?

656
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,633
Yeah, Mary, 'cause this is not
that loud.

657
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,427
I think this is
a perfectly acceptable indoor voice volume.

658
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,887
What is the deal?
Are you okay?

659
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,974
- Yeah.
- Why do you have sunglasses on?

660
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,451
Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

661
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,227
- [snorts]
- [Shazam chuckles]

662
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,813
I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

663
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,607
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

664
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,652
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

665
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,613
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

666
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,949
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

667
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,492
No, she...

668
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,035
Yeah, can we get back on track?

669
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,662
Listen, he's yelling at me

670
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,664
and he's saying the daughters
of Atlas

671
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,624
are coming to hunt us.

672
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,042
So, check out what I found.

673
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,726
"The daughters of Atlas
are the offspring

674
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,962
of the Titan Atlas..."

675
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,505
which is obvious,

676
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,718
but also Nyx, the Goddess
of Night and Death.

677
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,137
Well, good things
can happen at night.

678
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,805
- And death.
- [sighs]

679
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,640
Let me see this.

680
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,684
[intriguing music playing]

681
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,690
"The daughters
guard the mythic Tree of Life

00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,402
which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life

- dragon."
- Hey, now.

686
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,219
And I am suddenly here for this.

687
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,745
I know, right?

688
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,181
'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.

00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,998
- On the other hand, dragon!
- Dragon!

690
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,708
Mary. What are we doin'?

691
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,502
I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

692
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,088
Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page

693
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,840
and, and, and look,

694
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,676
I often think that you think
better than me.

695
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,388
The wizard did not exactly give
me a tutorial here, guys, okay?

696
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,474
Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

697
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,559
That, that room of doors,
or that violin

698
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,229
that is, like, constantly burning
which is super weird but also

699
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,792
definitely keeps
the lair cozy, right?

700
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,858
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

701
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,194
And it's not like
I'm not tryin'.

702
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,446
But I really,
really need your help.

703
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,451
Uh, I might know somebody
that can help.

704
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,583
Shut up. That lights up?

[rumbling]

00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,671
Shut up.

00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,497
So, I'm mapping out
the entire lair

709
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,207
and you withhold this?

710
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,041
[Shazam] And you have really
been holding out on us.

711
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,125
Jeez Louise, dude.

712
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,505
- Whoa!
- [Shazam] "Whoa" what?

713
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,173
- "Whoa" what?
- [superhero Darla] Look!

714
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,857
- [superhero Darla chuckles]
- Hey, Steve.

715
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,345
[chuckles] What?
You call the pen "Steve"?

716
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,029
Yeah, I thought he looked
like a "Steve."

717
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,057
[superhero Darla] He totally
looks like a "Steve."

718
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,229
"'Crime and Punishment, '
a book report by Pedro Pena?" -Yeah.

719
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,690
- [Shazam laughs]
- Pedro.

720
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,651
- Dude, that's cheating.
- I mean, he knows everything.

721
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,154
- Hmm.
- Seriously. Ask him.

722
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,655
You can just ask him stuff?

723
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,216
- Pretty much.
- [Shazam] Slick. Okay, cool.

724
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,868
Steve, we're looking
for information

725
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,911
about the daughters of Atlas.

726
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,955
Can you please help us
with that?

727
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,214
- These are book titles.
- [Shazam] Okay.

728
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,775
Let's just all pick a book,
or something.

729
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,177
Where's Freddy?
I mean, obscure mythology?

730
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,970
Definitely his thing.

731
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,598
I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.

732
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,143
[people chattering]

733
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,647
You know I've actually never,
never been up here.

734
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,067
Don't lie. [chuckles]
This is where you hang out

735
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,402
with your superhero friends,
isn't it?

736
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,797
No, actually, why would they ever have
to... Why would they ever come here?

737
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,501
I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by...

738
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,367
Do you actually know those guys?

739
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,495
Or is this like
a "Canadian girlfriend" situation?

740
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,847
Oh, you mean Collette?
Well, she and I

741
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,456
aren't really exclusive,
as of now.

742
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,540
[chuckles]

743
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,118
Do you wanna meet one of them?

744
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,796
Meet, like how?

745
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,214
Like, face-to-face, right now.

746
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,716
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

747
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,051
And today is your lucky day,

748
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,011
because I'm gonna call
the hot one.

749
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,347
Her?

750
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,932
- No, the male hot one.
- Him?

751
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,810
What? Him?

752
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,746
Look, I mean, it's all
subjective, right? But, um...

753
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,814
Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls

754
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,649
so... It's no big deal.

755
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,651
Is this a joke, Freddy?

756
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,445
'Cause I didn't mean
to make you actually prove it, really.

757
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,659
No, it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

758
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,512
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

759
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,622
So, don't move.
So, stay right there.

760
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,666
Hey, Captain Everypower.
What's goin' on?

761
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,460
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

762
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,729
Remember that time
I saved your life?

763
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,838
No, no, no, the other time.

764
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,339
Yeah.

765
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,800
Well, I'm calling in that favor.

766
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,180
[lightning cracks]

767
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,974
[heroic music plays]

768
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,394
You must be Anne.

769
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,188
[gasps] Oh, my God.

770
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,233
Friend of Freddy's, I hear.

771
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,111
I am, actually. Yeah.
How are you...

772
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,033
[sighs] You know, I may be
the one with the superpowers,

773
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,201
but that kid,

774
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,744
he's the real hero.

775
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,872
Yeah. I mean, honestly,

776
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,540
I've never met anyone like him.

777
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,917
He's... genuine

778
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,670
and warm and funny. [chuckles]

779
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,338
- That's a lot of nice things.
- Yeah.

780
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,633
How did you two meet?

781
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,801
Comic Con.

782
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,803
- What's Comic Con?
- What?

783
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,197
[superhero Mary]
According to this,

784
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,474
gods considered humans servants,

785
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,392
toys to be played with,

786
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,852
children to be punished.

787
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,481
[chuckles] Thanks, Steve.

788
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,025
Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods.

789
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,651
I'm reading about that
right now.

790
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,320
So, apparently, all of this

791
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,447
revolves around
a powerful weapon.

792
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,449
So Atlas, uh, the father

793
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,743
of the daughters of Atlas,
obviously, yeah,

794
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,666
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

795
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,289
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

796
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,209
but also to take powers away
from others.

797
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,754
So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

798
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,591
Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic.

799
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,218
But when things got bad,

800
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,221
a council of human wizards
got together and they

801
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,639
stole the staff from Atlas.

802
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,474
And they used that to take
his powers away.

803
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,035
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

804
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,536
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy,

805
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,395
this is the wizard that I know!

806
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,605
What do these say?

807
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,529
"The Wisdom of Solomon,

808
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,239
Strength of Hercules,
Stamina of Atlas,

809
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,907
Power of Zeus,
Courage of Achilles,

810
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,284
Speed of Mercury." These are
the powers they stole.

811
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,619
No.

812
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,706
Whoa, guys, look!

813
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,333
This is what the name means.

814
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,894
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

815
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,836
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so.

816
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,048
If I may point out one
of the powers that may be possibly MIA.

817
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,591
Boop.

818
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,717
[Shazam] I'm sorry,

819
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,594
are you very unsubtly implying

820
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,305
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

821
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,182
- Solo Man?
- Yeah.

822
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,935
Well, maybe it comes later.

823
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,937
I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do.

824
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,021
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah.

825
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,398
This is very, very hurtful.

826
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,667
I just want you all
to know that.

827
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,109
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

828
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,569
- Oh.
- [Shazam clears throat]

829
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,320
What else have we learned, fam?

830
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:28,783
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

831
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:33,162
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

832
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,290
magical sphere

833
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,166
sealing it away forever.

834
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,419
Cut off from magic.

835
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,546
Oh, so that's what
that was about.

836
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,716
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

837
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,053
A bizarre and gruesome scene
unfolded

838
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,847
in Athens, Greece this morning.

839
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,992
Two women dressed in what
appears to be ancient Greek...

840
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,077
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's the wizard's
staff. How did they get that?

841
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,853
So, all those statues
used to be people.

842
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:00,857
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

843
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,025
where Greece is at?

844
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,196
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

845
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,281
You want it back?

846
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,245
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

847
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,581
So, that's probably
where the journey started.

848
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,790
- You know?
- What?

849
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,250
What do you mean,
"What?" What?

850
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,936
- You just left it there?
- We were all there.

851
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,046
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

852
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,797
You're welcome, by the way.

853
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,191
And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do

854
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,217
super bad-guy stuff with it,
okay?

855
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,802
You broke the staff,

856
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,721
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

857
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,014
Which we now know.

858
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,974
We also now know
what they look like,

859
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,827
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

860
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,852
- coming a...
- Three.

861
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,935
What?

862
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,482
Atlas had three daughters.

863
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,859
Kalypso, Hespera,

864
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,694
Anthea.

865
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,238
Anne... thea.

866
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,369
You know, I'm not
just a superhero.

867
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,663
I'm a super listener.

868
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,040
And...

869
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,249
I sense...

870
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,170
that you may have feelings
for Freddy.

871
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,089
Just wanna know
when he's coming back.

872
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,633
Don't want him to get hurt.

873
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,678
Oh, well, Anne... [sighs]
I mean, we can't choose

874
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,429
the people we fall for.

875
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,056
What?

876
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,766
I'm not talking about that.

877
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,602
If he shows up now,
he's in serious danger.

878
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,729
Whoa! Look who you're with.

879
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,398
What could possibly
be dangerous?

880
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,481

Okay.

882
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,029
I see how it is.

Ow!

888
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,914
Oh, Freddy, I, I didn't know.

889
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,416
I never meant
for you to get hurt.

890
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,334
Oh, I'm not the one
who's gonna get hurt.

891

Shazam!

Freddy, are you all right?

896
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,762
Get back inside.
Just get back inside, Mr. Geckle.

897
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,014
I'm okay. Go back inside.

898
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,516
Who are you?
Do you have kids here?

899
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,952
What are you doing?
Don't hurt him.

900
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,520

What are you...
no, no, no!

Why would you do that?

Now, child, tell us where
to find the others.

920
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,449
No need.

- No.

That's not why we're here.

We're here for the seed

We stick to the plan we have.

937

Father would never yield.

938
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,179
And Father is dead.

Now, you know your place,
sister.

940
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,517
Or I will show it to you.

Sorry!

[Freddy] I'm sorry,

I'm sorry, just,
just save yourself.

this strange magical element

Okay. Bleak.

all about you.

Billy Batson. Yeah,
he's my best friend.

Captain Everypower.

Well, used to be.
It's complicated now.

She... It's complicated.

994
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,531
That halfwit Billy
gave you the powers of Shazam?

995
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,618
Yeah, he did. And he said
that you turned into ash, but, but didn't?

[grunts]

997
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,954
Once I gave him the power,

998
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,707
I could no longer remain
in my realm.

999
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,417
But death would have
been a luxury

in this cell

with the knowledge
of my failure, and with you.

1002

Mostly with you.

1003
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,525
A little more sarcastic
than Billy said,

1004
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,301
but, hey, all good.

Yeah, sure.

I sound nothing like that,
but okay.

Here's what we've got, um...

A cranky wizard
with a cynical streak

00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,372
and a precocious young man with an
encyclopedic knowledge regarding magical shit.

1011
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,359
There is no way these sisters
are keeping us in here.

1012
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,242
These prison bars,
they're probably enchanted!

- Please, stop talking.

1014

00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,286
Fine, then let's make a potion.

1018
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,497
Like a potion of, um, giant
strength or diminution.

1019

Oh! Gaseous form!

1020
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,793
Yeah! Maybe we could
float out of here like a fart.

1021
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,213
I gave my powers to children
who squandered it.

1022

We will die here, Freeby.

It's Freddy, by the way.
"Freeby"? Where do you even...

The sooner you accept it,

1025
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,597
the easier it will be.

1026
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,225
Is this a tooth?
There's a tooth in here!

1027
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,935
Hmm.

I don't know how we fight

1033
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,996
I tell you how we fight it.

1034
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,539
With the wisdom of...

1035
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,709
- Solomon.
- Exactly.

1036
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,586
We, we set up a meeting.

1037
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,046
Yeah, we tell 'em we want
to negotiate.

Offer up our powers for Freddy.

1039
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,176
But then we grab one of them

1040
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,011
and that's what we really use
to trade!

1041
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,637
But what if they steal
our powers?

1042
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,848
No, they won't, 'cause we know
how they work now.

1043
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,493
You know what I mean? If they just
point that staff at us, we dodge.

1044
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,103
[imitates whooshing sounds]
Like dodgeball.

1045

- Hmm.
- Dude, I suck at dodgeball.

1046
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,399
Well, maybe Pedro sucks
at dodgeball,

1047
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,859
but not Super Pedro.

1048
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,111
No, Super Pedro also sucks
at dodgeball.

1049

Fine. Listen, all I know is that
there's five of us and three of them.

1050
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,533
So I think we should
send them a little invitation.

1051
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,162
Okay.

1052
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,247
So, Steve says that this paper

1053
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,458
is a stack of magical parchment.

1054
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,418
You write a message
on the magical paper

1055
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,421
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

1056
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,007
and then the paper folds
into a...

00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,468
[gasps] Oh, my God, yes!

1058
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,304
A paper bird.

1059
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,972
And it flies to the god.

1060
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,849
[Super Hero Eugene] Well,
that's kinda cute.

1061
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,978
Hey, what about demigods? Uh,
you know, like, Wonder Woman?

1062
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,272
Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?

1063
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:28,609
Did the pen just shrug?

1064
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,737
Hey, Steve, do I just
dictate to...

1065
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,865
I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.

1066
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,075
All right. [clears throat]

1067
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,370
Letter...

1068
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,332
Letter, writing a letter.
No, no, no!

1069
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,000
I was just talking out loud.

1070
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,044
That's not a part
of the letter. Wad that up, too.

1071
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,672
[superhero Darla]
Maybe if you try

1072
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,799
- speaking from the heart.
- Hmm.

1073
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,676
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

1074
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,845
violence is not the answer."

1075
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,889
[foreboding music playing]

1076
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,061
[Freddy grunting]

1077
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,432
- [soldier growls]
- [Freddy grunts]

1078
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,369
[Hespera] Child,

1079
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,454
I will spare your life
if you're honest with me.

1080
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,956
Honesty.

1081
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,626
Yeah, wow, very, um,
ironic subject choice.

1082
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:29,753
The other Champions...

1083
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,172
are they children like yourself?

1084
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:34,049
What even is a child?

1085
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,885
I mean, I know I shave,
like, every week-ish.

1086
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,595
Yes or no?

1087
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,806
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

1088
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:44,393
to grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

1089
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,896
- Give us their names.
- The names of the Champions?

1090
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,109
Um, well, there's
Brett Breyer, and, uh, Burke Breyer.

1091
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,527
Are you guys taking
this stuff in?

1092
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,029
Writing this down? No?

1093
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,280
They drive a Dodge Ram.

1094
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,531
He's lying.

1095
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,075
That's your superpower,
not mine.

1096
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,879
And she thinks
you're a total control freak.

1097
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,121
One of you.

1098
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,247
Probably you.

1099
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,500
- [gasps]
- Hold him.

1100
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,586
[soldier growls]

1101
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,880
[Freddy] Don't... [grunts]
What's happening?

1102
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,214
What is that?
What's she doing?

1103
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,758
Power of chaos.

1104
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,177
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

1105
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,846
Oh. [chuckles]
My mind is already trash,

1106
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,182
so I'd actually like
to see you try.

1107
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,392
Because nobody has the balls

1108
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,561
to handle what's
inside my brain.

1109
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,813
[whispering] Say their names.

1110
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,607
[magical voices whispering]

1111
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,733
[gasping]

1112
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,276
[screaming]

1113
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,988
Say their names.

1114
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,866
[magical voices]
Say their names.

1115
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,743
[screaming continues]

1116
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,873
Destiny's Child did it better.

1117
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,291
He is stronger than he looks.

1118
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,460
[Freddy screaming]

1119
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,337
- Say their names.
- Stop!

1120
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,049
[hesitating] Billy...

1121
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,012
Billy Bats...

1122
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,267
Billy B...

1123
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,811
Stop.

1124
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,480
[breathing shakily]

1125
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,981
This is from the Champions.

1126
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,318
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

1127
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,821
violence is not the answer.

1128
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,574
Oh, good first sentence.
Thanks, Darla.

1129
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,326
- We'd like to make a trade.
- What?

1130
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,911
We'll give up our powers

1131
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:29,248
if you give us Freddy,
add 'unharmed.'

1132
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,334
Otherwise, they're gonna
monkey's-paw you.

1133
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,794
Smart, Eugene.

1134
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,171
Steve, add 'unharmed'

1135
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,549
then, like, 'yours, trul...'

1136
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,343
No, 'Sincerely, best'.

1137
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,304
Maybe just signed
'The Champions.'

1138
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,056
Should we proofread it?

1139
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,308
Naw, Steve doesn't
make mistakes,

1140
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,768
just writes what you say.

1141
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:53,230
Great. I feel good
about this. Me, too.

1142
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:56,191
Anyone else want a Gatorade?

1143
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,484
Do we have red?"

1144
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:01,113
What is this Gatorade?

1145
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,907
- [dramatic music playing]
- [yelps]

1146
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,909
- Is it a weapon?
- Sister.

1147
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,912
We need not torture him
any longer. You heard the letter.

1148
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,664
[grunting]

1149
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,458
- Throw them in the pit.
- [Anthea] Wait.

1150
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,002
They want to make a trade.

1151
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,256
And we will meet, sister.

1152
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,008
But humans are not
to be trusted.

1153
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,678
The pit is just a bad name
for a fun place, right?

1154
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,431
Right? [grunts]

1155
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,435
[wizard and Freddy screaming]

1156
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,479
- [wizard groans]
- [Freddy coughing]

1157
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,982
[both grunting]

1158
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,242
Are you hurt?

1159
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,828
No, just worthless.

1160
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,331
- Well, you must get up.
- For what?

1161
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:56,210
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just...

1162
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,212
a way for me to pretend
I'm not broken.

1163
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,005
Oh, feelings.

1164
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,091
[rumbling]

1165
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,388
[grunting]

1166
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,768
[unsettling music playing]

1167
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,397
- I see something moving.
- Yeah, I see it, too.

1168
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,609
[heavy footsteps approaching]

1169
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,740
[Freddy breathing heavily]

1170
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,121
[low growling]

1171
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,164
[Freddy] Oh, shit.

1172
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,584
What is that?

1173
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,961
Ladon.

1174
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,255
The guardian
of the Garden of Atlas.

1175
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,926
- [Ladon growling]
- [Freddy whimpering]

1176
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:48,928
[roars]

1177
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,600
- Run.
- I can't. I can't!

1178
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,481
- [roaring]
- [Freddy screams]

1179
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,783
[powers trilling]

1180
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,785
[Freddy breathing shakily]

1181
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,870
- [screams]
- You're okay! You're okay.

1182
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,581
I don't feel okay at all.

1183
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:18,166
That's the power of the dragon.

1184
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,419
It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

1185
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,796
Ladon's fear paralyzes
any mortal,

1186
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,048
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

1187
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,719
Power of axis. Very cool, very,

1188
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,637
- very rare.
- [Hespera] Anthea!

1189
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,681
[Anthea] I must go.

1190
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,642
The door back to your world
is at the center of the labyrinth.

1191
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,477
Right, left, left

1192
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,063
and then follow
the right-hand wall to the center.

1193
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,867
- You'll need this.
- How did you find this?

1194
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,483
You once protected me
from the bullies

1195
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,611
in your world, Freddy Freeman.

1196
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:46,903
Now I've protected you in mine.

1197
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,328
- Hero.
- [both chuckle]

1198
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,497
Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.

1199
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,166
I was about to rearrange
those boys'

1200
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,792
internal organs
when you stepped in.

1201
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:03,462
But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

1202
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,381
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1203
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:10,052
No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

1204
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,723
[clears throat] How lovely
for both of you.

1205
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,100
Goddess, we thank you much,
but we must get...

1206
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,895
You should go. My sisters
don't need you anymore.

1207
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,438
All they require now
is the seed.

1208
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,524
- The seed?
- Yes.

1209
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,401
Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable

1210
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,445
by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.

1211
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,947
You call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!

1212
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,742
[whimsical music playing]

1213
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,747
[people chattering]

1214
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,129
[Shazam] Hi, God... No?

1215
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,385
Yo, Low Voltage.

1216
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,055
When you fixing
this dome shit, man?

1217
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,556
Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry, sir.

1218
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,933
[clicks tongue] I have a plan.

1219
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,434
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1220
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,198
'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.

1221
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,521
No, these sandwiches?

1222
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,748
No, these sandwiches
are important.

1223
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,190
They're, they're for a meeting.

1224
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,527
Yeah, sure,
Colonel Cheesesteak. [scoffs]

1225
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,194
Colonel?

1226
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,031
Oh, boy, I really need a name.

1227
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,159
[dramatic chord plays]

1228
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,037
Quiet one, she is.

1229
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,665
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

1230
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,250
[chuckles nervously]

1231
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,793
Is that...

1232
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,670
Oh, you're totally serious.
Okay.

1233
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,380
Uh...

1234
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,258
Right, so, look, here's
the thing, um, you're upset.

1235
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,141
A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers,

1236
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,470
which totally sucks balls,
I totally get it.

1237
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,432
But, I kind of feel like
you're taking this all,

1238
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,476
like, really personally and, like,
I don't even know you, lady, right?

1239
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,979
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

1240
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,148
and stole all your coin
and then fled,

1241
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,525
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

1242
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,570
And say, in this pursuit
the thieves

1243
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,071
dropped the money on the ground

1244
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,657
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

1245
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,661
Now, imagine it is not money,

1246
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,955
but the lifeblood
of your father.

1247
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,040
The last breath of your mother.

1248
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,460
The power of all the gods,

1249
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,755
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

1250
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,424
And now this magic courses
through you,

1251
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,301
and you have the gall

1252
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,845
to believe that you deserve it?

1253
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,349
This is very personal,

1254
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,642
Billy.

1255
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,565
You are very menacing.

1256
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,859
I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...

1257
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,571
I see the presence
that you have, and that goes a long way.

1258
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,158
But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

1259
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,118
[both] There is no compromise.

1260
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,120
I knew you were gonna say that.

1261
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,498
Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?

1262
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,083
Give us back Freddy,
you take down this

1263
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,337
sphere-y dome-y magic bowl thing

1264
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,963
and then, you know,

1265
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,691
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

1266
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,925
- [scoffs]
- It's a good offer.

1267
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,134
I'm being serious.

1268
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,804
You play the part of a man,

1269
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,264
but you do not play it well.

1270
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,600
Give us the powers, child.

1271
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,061
All of them.

1272
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,896
You are no leader, Billy.

1273
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,816
You are a lost boy

1274
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:14,110
who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.

1275
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,363
Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you

1276
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,406
'cause I'm not, like,
super old like you,

1277
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,701
but I think I have
a few experiences that you don't have.

1278
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:25,038
'Cause I've seen all of the
Fast and the Furious movies, lady.

1279
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,706
And let me tell you something.

1280
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,835
It's all about family!

1281
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,670
[music swells]

1282
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,172
- [music stops]
- [birds cawing]

1283
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,467
Family!

1284
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,679
Guys, that was the signal. We practiced
this, like, 12 times. Thank you.

1285
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,764
Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, Goddess?

1286
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,977
No, human.
You forgot about mine.

1287
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,021
[screams, grunts]

1288
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,232
[dramatic music playing]

1289
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,277
[Hespera grunts]

1290
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,445
[Shazam grunting]

1291
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,530
[man] Come on!

1292
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,614
- Let's go.
- Pedro!

1293
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:02,408
[staff whirs]

1294
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,035
[grunts]

1295
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:09,702
[superhero Eugene quavering]

1296
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,003
[both quavering]

1297
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,262
- [Shazam grunts]
- [gasps]

1298
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,306
- [Shazam grunting]
- [electricity crackling]

1299
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,104
[groans]

1300
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,861
You're wasting my time, boy.

1301
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,449
[powers resonate]

1302
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,492
[both grunting]

1303
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,671
[rumbling]

1304
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,969
[women grunting]

1305
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,018
[Shazam grunts]

1306
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,068
Yeah.

1307
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,361
[Shazam] Whoo!

1308
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,071
She sure didn't see that coming

1309
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:25,033
because she didn't go
to the eye doctor. [chuckles]

1310
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,826
[Shazam] Uh, Darla,
that was, 'cause...

1311
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,371
- [rattling]
- A euphemism. That was a euphemism.

1312
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,254
- [Shazam] No!
- [women grunting]

1313
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:51,101
[Shazam groans]

1314
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,536
[Hespera] We've taken the power
from two

1315
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,354
in your family already.

1316
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,940
And now two more must die,
and for what?

1317
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,484
So you can keep playing soldier?

1318
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,528
[Shazam grunting]

1319
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,166
- [choking]
- [groaning]

1320
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,587
[groans]

1321
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,631
[grunting]

1322
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,805
[grunting]

1323
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,106
My father was Atlas.

1324
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:41,026
Titan god of stamina
and strength.

1325
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,489
His magic and power
may course through you,

1326
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,868
but you will never
be a true god.

1327
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,911
Oh, yeah? Did your dad
have superspeed?

1328
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,205
[both grunt]

1329
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,626
- [coughing]
- Nope!

1330
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,840
[both panting]

1331
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,885
You okay? That was fun.
Let's go.

1332
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,849
Come on. Come on, come on.

1333
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,103
[Shazam] Hurry, everyone!

1334
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,187
Let's go, let's go.

1335
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,824
What?

1336
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,701
- [door closes]
- [chain locks]

1337
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,161
You thought you were just goin'

1338
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,680
into some regular porta-potty,
didn't ya?

1339
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,873
Which I can somehow still smell.

1340
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,101
Yeah, yeah, it really sticks
around. It's crazy, right?

1341
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,251
- Yeah.
- Like, permeates

1342
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,878
the air.
Doesn't matter. Anyway,

1343
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,338
welcome to the Rock of Eternity.

1344
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,632
Only Champions

1345
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,093
can get in here,
through any door that we want.

1346
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,887
Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't.

1347
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,473
Guys, that's what I call
a total success.

1348
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,893
Okay, maybe, like,
a partial total win.

1349
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,816
- Told you I suck at dodgeball.
- [Shazam] Yeah,

1350
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,313
you do, yeah, but you know,

1351
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,749
look, Pedro, we all have
our weak spots.

1352
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,066
You know what I mean?

1353
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,776
And hers... [chuckles]

1354
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,402
lack of strategic thinking.

1355
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,363
Now for the real trade.

1356
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,783
Freddy and the staff,
for your freedom.

1357
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,302
[superhero Darla] And get rid
of the dome.

1358
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,410
[Shazam] Oh, yeah.

1359
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,621
And get rid of the dome.

1360
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,248
'Cause the city
of brotherly love

1361
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,499
is gettin' a little moist.

1362
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,336
Word choice, man.

1363
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,480
[Shazam] Yeah, I regretted it
as soon as

1364
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,131
it was coming out of my mouth.

1365
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,132
[Super Hero Eugene] It's just
one of those words...

1366
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,255
[Shazam] I know. I just...

1367
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,140
"Dear daughters
of Asshat-Las."

1368
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,891
- Burn!
- [chuckles]

1369
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,226
I just came up with that.

1370
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,537
Make sure you put a dash
in there, though,

1371
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,437
so it's really clear. Okay.

1372
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,881
[clears throat] Man, it's so
good having Steve cover grammar

1373
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,221
and spelling and stuff,
it makes me sound so much smarter.

1374
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,987
[clears throat] So...

1375
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,030
"A brother for a sister, huh?

1376
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,740
How's that feel?

1377
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,618
Also, how are you
actually sisters,

1378
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,413
because the age difference
is very noticeable,

1379
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,708
and slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."

1380
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,127
Even though I don't like you
very much,

1381
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,087
I believe everyone
deserves human rights,

1382
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:07,881
but you don't deserve
strawberry.

1383
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,800
You only get yellow. [gasps]

1384
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,219
She's gone!

1385
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:16,973
Wait, what?

1386
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,017
[dramatic music playing]

1387
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,694
I thought we brought her in
too easily.

1388
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,779
She wanted to get caught.

1389
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:35,241
I don't get it.
Where would she even go?

1390
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,325
[clanking]

1391
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,244
[door creaks]

1392
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,836
Well, this seemed inevitable.

1393
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,179
Yep. We are so lost.
Thanks, bozo.

1394
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,349
We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?

1395
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,975
I don't know.

1396
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,353
You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,

1397
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,396
you know nothing about magic,
you're just...

1398
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,109
You're the wizard.

1399
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,362
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

1400
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:15,114
Now let's see if that
girlfriend of yours can be trusted.

1401
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:21,037
[tense music playing]

1402
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,494
- [door unlocks]
- [Freddy gasps]

1403
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,632
Get back, get back. Get back.

1404
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,769
[whispering in other language]

1405
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:50,607
[Hespera gasps]

1406
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,513
[in English] Okay,
I think the coast is clear. Let's go home.

1407
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:03,871
One moment.

1408
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:06,291
Did you not see
what she was holding?

1409
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,042
It was an apple.
She wanted a snack.

1410
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,419
What's the big deal?

1411
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,755
The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life.

1412
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,590
From the Tree of Life.

1413
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:16,955
Oh, wait, hold up, didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?

1414
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,264
- Billy!
- Billy. Gosh.

1415
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,347
[wizard groans]

1416
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:24,975
Where are you going now?

1417
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:30,897
[inhales sharply]

1418
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,819
[exhales] Nope.

1419
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:35,902
She's not in there.

1420
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:38,197
Nope.

1421
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,907
No, no, no.
That's a hard pass.

1422
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:42,011
- That's a hard pass.
- [Super Hero Eugene] Yo, Billy,

1423
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,494
you don't gotta worry
about that one.

1424
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,264
It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.

1425
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,956
- [sniffs]
- Like an ancient Greek

1426
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,160
- labyrinth?
- [Shazam] Guys...

1427
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,336
[sniffs] porta-potty.

1428
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,087
- [sniffs]
- [Super Hero Eugene] Mmm.

1429
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,431
Hespera.

1430
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,439
It's over, sisters.

1431
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:14,025
Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

1432
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,780
Or we plant it in their realm.

1433
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,200
But that would destroy
their world.

1434
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,577
Just as they destroyed ours.

1435
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,788
[Hespera] You can't be serious.

1436
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,664
- Yes.
- [Anthea] No.

1437
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,208
No, that's not
what we agreed to.

1438
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,959
[Kalypso] Anthea,
you simpering bore.

1439
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,586
[Hespera] She's right,
we've spent ages

1440
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,129
waiting for this moment.

1441
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:36,547
[Anthea] We have the seed.

1442
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,508
We have the staff
and its powers.

1443
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,967
[Hespera]
We are not squandering it

1444
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:41,844
for your personal satisfaction.

1445
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,889
[whispering]
No, I should go, not you.

1446
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,933
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

1447
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,286
The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly sing "sneak thief."

1448
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,705
But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy when you walk.

1449
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:52,980
- It's pathetic.
- [knees crack]

1450
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,107
See?

1451
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,609
Fortune be with you, Freddy.

1452
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,778
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1453
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,365
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1454
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,827
[chuckles] That's it.
You nailed it.

1455
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,453
I'll see you on the other side.

1456
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,432
[Hespera] Even if we did,
the Tree of Life

1457
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,125
would not thrive in their soil.

1458
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,294
It would despoil, it would
disfigure into something...

1459
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,712
[Kalypso] Monstrous?

1460
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:19,173
That is what humans are.

1461
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:22,176
It is only fitting
that we bring our monsters to their world

1462
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,720
and do to them
as they did to us.

1463
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,017
[Anthea] We agreed
to restore balance

1464
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:33,563
and vengeance has
great measure of weight on those scales.

1465
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,649
Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves.

1466
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,609
- No, not all.
- All.

1467
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:42,155
[Hespera] Sister, I fear your
rage has gotten the better of you.

1468
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,406
[Kalypso] Why?

1469
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,825
Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,

1470
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,035
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1471
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:50,413
They actually pray
for order and peace

1472
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,624
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1473
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,918
Anthea, I want you
to take the apple

1474
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,087
and plant it in our garden.

1475
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:00,923
[Kalypso] Of course
you turn to her.

1476
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,675
Father would be ashamed
of both of you.

1477
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,469
- [object clatters]
- [Freddy yelps]

1478
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,345
Where did that even come from?

1479
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,891
- Hi!
- You favor her, Hespera,

1480
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,559
and see how she betrays us.

1481
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:16,832
Deliver him
to his proper fate, sister.

1482
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,983
- No!
- [Kalypso] Kill him!

1483
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,197
What is that?

1484
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,073
[Shazam] Great question.
No idea.

1485
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,743
But made you look.

1486
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:29,994
Billy! [chuckles]

1487
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,539
- Oh!
- Oh.

1488
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,333
- [Freddy gasps]
- Your crutch!

1489
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,336
- Oh! Shazam!
- [lightning cracks]

1490
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,419
- Yes!
- No!

1491
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:45,343
So, we have a lot to talk about.

1492
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,730
Kalypso, hand me the staff.

1493
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,234
You are not fit to wield it.

1494
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,652
More fit than you.

1495
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,415
You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing.

1496
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,782
Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father,

1497
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,909
but everyone here
has become weak.

1498
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,204
Ladon, world-eater,

1499
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,582
rise from the pit!

1500
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,626
[clanking]

1501
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,922
[Ladon roars]

1502
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,051
[Shazam] Go, go, go!

1503
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,445
[superhero Darla]
Captain Everypower! Where's he going?

1504
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:29,762
[Super Hero Eugene] What the...

1505
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,514
- [superhero Mary screams]
- [Ladon roars]

1506
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,351
[all screaming]

1507
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,146
[roars]

1508
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:42,024
[snoring]

1509
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,068
[superheroes chattering faintly]

1510
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,403
[Rosa] Victor?

1511
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,531
Victor, wake up.

1512
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,826
Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?

1513
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,452
Dad. We gotta go!

1514
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,656
- We gotta get out of here.
- We have to go right now!

1515
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,915
This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.

1516
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,726
That's not true. I have
no idea what this looks like.

1517
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,419
Just don't freak out.

1518
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:02,920
[Victor and Rosa screaming]

1519
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,964
[all speaking at once]

1520
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,193
I said don't freak out!
Look at me, it's Billy.

1521
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,857
Rosa, it's Billy, okay?
And that's Eugene,

1522
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,178
- and that's Freddy...
- It's me.

1523
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:12,573
That's Darla
and that's Mary, obvi,

1524
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,056
and then Pedro,
just normal Pedro.

1525
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,058
[Shazam panting]

1526
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,327
Guys, this is no time
for secrets, okay?

1527
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,562
We have to tell 'em the truth.

1528
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,023
- [all] We're superheroes.
- I'm gay.

1529
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,107
Yeah, we know, bud.

1530
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:25,693
- You knew?
- Yeah.

1531
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,988
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1532
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,865
- I'm the wizard.
- Oh, this is the wizard.

1533
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,508
He's a wizard who's called
"the wizard."

1534
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,303
Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, hurry up.

1535
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,387
[superhero Darla]
Put on these clothes.

1536
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,912
This is so weird.

1537
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,205
[Shazam] Yep, yep.

1538
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:40,875
You guys are
the Philly Fiascoes?

1539
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,253
Okay. This is in no way
an acknowledgement of that stupid nickname

1540
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,398
but, yes, that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

1541
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,382
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

1542
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,801
Dragon?

1543
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:52,845
- [all screaming]
- [Ladon roars]

1544
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,514
[Victor whimpers]

1545
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:00,436
[ominous music playing]

1546
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,605
[roaring]

1547
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,191
- [Super Hero Eugene] You okay?
- [breathing heavily]

1548
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,215
Okay.

1549
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,052
I know this is a lot to take in,

1550
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,054
but I promise
to explain it all later.

1551
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,847
[Victor] Explain what?

1552
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,617
That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods

1553
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,327
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

1554
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,520
- Yeah.
- Wait, you bought the house?

1555
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:43,854
Yeah.

1556
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,856
- [rumbling]
- [superhero Freddy gasps]

1557
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:47,774
[roars]

1558
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,238
Run! Go!

1559
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,281
[all screaming]

1560
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,575
[roars]

1561
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,914
- [both grunting]
- Oh, no.

1562
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,583
[Ladon roars]

1563
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:05,835
[Pedro] Get down.

1564
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,378
[superhero Freddy]
Okay, that's it!

1565
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:12,299
[screams, grunting] Again?

1566
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,218
- [roars]
- [Shazam] Freddy!

1567
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,682
Hey, hey!
This is what you want, right?

1568
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:26,856
[Ladon growls]

1569
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,656
Come on, we're good.

1570
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,050
We're safe right now.
Let's go. Let's go.

[screaming]

1576
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,683
Mary!

1577
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,687
- No.
- [gasping]

1578
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,731
[Mary screaming]

1579
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,103
Hey. Are you okay?

1580
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:49,854
You okay?

1581
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,357
All right.

1582
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,903
Now, where is this dragon?

1583
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:05,496
[roars]

1584
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:12,211
[foreboding music playing]

1585
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,391
Fitting place for a garden.

[screeching]

Go! Let's go, let's go!

[whimpers]

1605
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:09,847
Oh, God, I'm slipping!
Slipping!

1606
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,018
- [people chattering]
- My shoe!

1607

Holy moly.

[creatures roaring, screeching]

1615
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,603
You know, I never thought
I'd say this about a dragon,

1616
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,189
but it is the least
of our problems right now.

1617
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,985
Your world will not
survive this.

1618
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,278
Yeah, no shit, Merlin!

1619
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,362
[Anthea] He's right.

1620
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,115
Anne!

1621
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:12,701
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- I'm okay, I'm fine.

1622
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,496
In the God Realm, this tree...

1623
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,832
is a thing of beauty.

1624
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,584
Of peace.

1625
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:23,087
It was not meant
for the soil of this realm

1626
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,297
and it's become monstrous
by the hand that planted it.

1627
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,424
Whose side is she on, anyway?
Do you...

1628
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,593
I must try to sway Hespera.

1629
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,637
Only she can subdue our sister.

1630
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,722
I will give it my all,
or die trying.

1631
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,265
Die? No, I'm pretty sure

1632
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,868
we can come up
with an alternative to dying.

1633
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,394
My sweet Freddy,
I'm ready if need be.

1634
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,021
I've lived a long life.

1635
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:42,665
What are you talking about,
"Lived a long life?"

1636
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:43,524
We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

1637
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,567
I'm over 6,000 years old.

1638
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,069
- Oh?
- [chuckles]

1639
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:49,612
You look great.

1640
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:51,197
Oh.

1641
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,205
Suddenly seems inappropriate.

1642
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,288
Yeah.

1643
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,591
We can't let her die.
She called me sweet!

1644
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,218
We have to figure something out.

1645
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,595
Take my powers back.

1646
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,013
- No, Billy!
- No, no, no.

1647
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,723
Hey, take my powers back.

1648
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,076
You gave 'em to me, so you can
take 'em back, right?

1649
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,269
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1650
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,538
You think I know
how to fix this, dude,

1651
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,188
but I really don't, okay?

1652
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,566
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1653
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,252
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1654
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:28,861
which means you know what to do.

1655
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,904
And you were right.

1656
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,157
You picked
the wrong champion, man.

1657
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,093
I mean, that's why I always
say "all or none," right?

1658
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,244
Because without my family,
I'm nothing.

1659
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,708
And honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

1660
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:43,917
[wizard] No.

1661
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,460
You don't have a shred of wisdom

1662
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,004
in that brain of yours.

1663
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,799
But your heart is wise.

1664
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:54,303
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1665
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:57,931
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1666
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,602
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1667
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:04,146
with my brothers and sisters.

1668
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,939
But when you shared your powers,

1669
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,775
you did not hesitate.

1670
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:11,153
For you, everyone can be worthy

1671
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,738
if given a chance.

1672
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,158
Now, go fight for your family.

1673
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,410
Go fight for the world.

1674
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,704
I chose right when I chose you.

1675
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,751
[Freddy] Billy?

1676
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,628
Billy, what are we gonna do,
man?

1677
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:30,714
Same thing we
always do, Freddy. Save the God darn world.

1678
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,466
Now, I'm gonna go get that staff

1679
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,301
and I need you to lure
these things away

1680
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,095
from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?

1681
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,931
Wait, wait, wait, Billy, Billy.

1682
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,183
Can I just see you,
before you go?

1683
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:43,227
Not this version.

1684
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,145
You... You.

1685
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,313
My Billy.

1686
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,358
[gentle music playing]

1687
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,528
Shazam!

1688
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,614
[lightning cracks]

1689
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,158
Is that why the house keeps
getting struck by lightning?

1690
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:02,578
Hey.

1691
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,588
I promise after this

1692
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:13,423
if I don't get eaten
by a dragon,

1693
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,760
I'm not gonna force you
to keep me.

1694
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:19,054
- Okay?
- What?

1695
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,847
I know I age out soon.

1696
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,767
Billy.

1697
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:28,230
My wonderful, kind, brave, son.

1698
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,713
You will never age out
of your home.

1699
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:32,693
Never.

1700
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,283
Now, do me a favor

1701
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:41,743
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

1702
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:44,246
go kick their ass, okay?

1703
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,581
I love you, Mom.

1704
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,250
Me too.

1705
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,088
- Shazam!

01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,591
[dramatic music playing]

1707
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,762
That's gonna take
some getting used to.

1708
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,639
Everybody to the battle wagon!

1709
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:03,974
The battle wagon?

1710
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,077
Trying to get
into the spirit of things.

1711
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,441
[engine starts]

1712
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:15,527
[growling]

1713
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,080
Don't you see what
you're doing to these people?

1714
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,164
[Kalypso] I do.

1715
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:30,834
And what I see is just.

1716
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,252
Hespera, look at this tree.

1717
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,921
It is blighted.
It is unnatural here.

1718
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,840
We made a vow
to restore our realm,

1719
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,508
not destroy another.

1720
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,445
[Kalypso] A god has answered
their prayers at last.

1721
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,721
They did not know their place,

1722
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,306
so I am showing it to them.

1723
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:47,934
Your fanatical tone
echoes our uncle Hades.

1724
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,020
No. I'm putting an end
to this.

1725
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:51,103

1728
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,162
No!

1729
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,915
Hespera.

1730
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:13,794
If your emotions rest
with the humans so, Anne,

1731
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,171
then perhaps you should
be human.

1732
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:26,723

Somebody help!

Okay, now what? There are only
so many minotaurs

1747
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:32,448
I can run over with this van.

[gasps]

1749
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,960
Hey, Steve.

1750
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,131
What are monsters afraid of?

1751
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,094
"The king of beasts."

1752
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,262
Lions?

1753
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:48,430
Unicorns.

1754
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:50,515
Really? I love unicorns.

1755
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,559
Yet, the unicorn
does not love you.

1756
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:54,603
Guys, unicorns don't exist.

1757
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,521

- [Freddy] Oh, my...
- Ah! [pants]

1760
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,028
I guess maybe it's not so crazy.

1761
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,114
The unicorn is the most
fearsome creature of its realm.

1762
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:07,616
Ruthless and cruel,

1763
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,010
not like the ponies
from your storybooks.

1764
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,494
They loathe humanity.

1765
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:12,120
Is there anything they do like?

1766
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,749
"Dark caverns. Ambrosia"?

1767
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,393
Ambrosia. It's like the nectar
of the gods.

1768
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,085
It's supposed to be sweet,
like honey.

1769
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,378
I have an idea.

1770
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,130
Go, go! Quick, quick.

1771
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:24,841

1776
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,186

1779
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,152
Anne!

I am not entirely sure
how to parent, here.

- Yeah, go, High Voltage!
- Oh, wassup, bro?

It's Maximum Voltage actually,
amongst other names.

That's right.

Run!

01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,933
This is a terrible idea.

01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,645
The most powerful thing
about you

1927
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:40,938
is you.

1928
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:42,190
You taught me that.

1929
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,363
[both yelling]

1930
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:52,325

[Shazam] Boom! [chuckles]

1937
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:14,305
That must be super
disappointing as a dragon.

1938
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,309
Assuming that you are one.

1939
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:20,103
I mean, you fly,
and you breathe fire,

1940
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:22,313
but you're also made of wood
which is a weird flex

1941
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,607
and a serious design flaw,
if I'm being honest.

1942
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:26,984
Freddy, Anthea, don't!

1943
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,490
- [Shazam chuckles]
- Ah, made you look!

1944
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:34,158
Oh, lady, that's twice.

1945
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:36,327
And I didn't even need
a flaming violin that time.

1946

[Shazam chuckles]

1947
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,956

Come get it.

[growls]

1968
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:54,006
Remove the dome.

1969
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:56,050
As long as I still breathe,

1970
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:59,553
the dome still stands.

1971
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:03,391

Billy!

1978
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:50,354
- Get out of there.
- [Shazam] I can't.

1979
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:51,522
Billy.

1980
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,149
[Shazam] I have to do this.

1981
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:56,795
[Freddy] Billy,
what are you doing?

1982
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,130
You're not supposed
to be in there.

1983
01:41:58,154 --> 01:42:01,365
Yeah, I am.

1984
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:03,343
I used to think that
I couldn't do anything right,

1985
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:05,077
that I didn't deserve my powers,

1986
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:08,062
but there's something
that I can do.

1987
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:09,622
No.

1988
01:42:10,624 --> 01:42:12,209
I can save all of you.

1989
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:13,794
But it's all or none!

1990
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:15,629
[Shazam] Yeah.

1991
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,953
All of my family gets to live
and none of them gets hurt.

1992
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:23,304
Freddy, I've never
had a family. You know that.

1993
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,348
Everybody I've ever cared
about, they all left me.

1994
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:27,224
My mom, my dad, everyone.

1995
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,353
So when I found you guys,
I had to hang on

1996
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:31,663
and I've been hanging on
too tight.

1997
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,064
No.

1998
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:34,707
I should have let you
do your own thing.

1999
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:38,402
Now it's time for you to fly.

2000
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:39,486
What about you?

2001
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:46,285

Okay. You're supposed
to wake up.

01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:15,788
[chirps]

2110
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:18,875
- [dramatic chord plays]
- [all scream]

2111
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:19,959
It's a zombie!

2112
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:23,296
[Shazam grunts] Guys!

2113
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:25,549
What the hell?

2114
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:27,509
You buried me?

2115
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:29,970
In what, like, two minutes?

2116
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:31,054
Oh, Billy!

2117
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:32,723
[all whooping]

2118
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:33,932
Hey.

2119
01:53:34,016 --> 01:53:36,268
Oh, man. I missed you guys.

2120
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:40,772
Hi. Hey.

2121
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,650
Oh, my God. Hi.

2122
01:53:43,734 --> 01:53:45,360
Why didn't anybody tell...

2123
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:47,320
Hi. Sorry, sorry,
I didn't, uh...

2124
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:50,365
I didn't see you there,
I was, um, I was...

2125
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:51,533
I was dead at the time.

2126
01:53:52,617 --> 01:53:53,702
So, you, uh...

2127
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:55,996
you got my bird letter?

2128
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:58,582
Oh, I, uh...

2129
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:01,626
I think you've got something...

2130
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,671
On my...

2131
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:06,173
Where... Oh.

2132
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:07,924
What?

2133
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:09,843
That's a spider.

2134
01:54:09,926 --> 01:54:11,428
I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

2135
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,930
Also, [chuckling]
that's really embarrassing.

2136
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:15,223
Yes, it is.

2137
01:54:15,307 --> 01:54:17,684
But it was an amazing thing
you did.

2138
01:54:17,768 --> 01:54:19,644
The sacrifice you made.

2139
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:22,647
You brought this world
back to life.

2140
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:24,858
Maybe this time, gods and humans

2141
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,568
can learn to live in peace.

2142
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:27,651
Yeah.

2143
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:30,947
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

2144
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:34,701
Be well, Billy Batson.

2145
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:39,706
Hey, you know, just because
your father's power

2146
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,291
is surging through me,

2147
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:43,460
that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,

2148
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:45,003
and I'm gonna be 18

2149
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:46,807
in, like, five months, so...
[clicks tongue]

2150
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,091
Stick to saving the world, kid.

2151
01:54:49,174 --> 01:54:51,093
Yeah, you know, like,
that's... Okay, cool.

2152
01:54:51,176 --> 01:54:52,719
See ya.

2153
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:54,513
What's with our boys
and older women?

2154
01:54:54,596 --> 01:54:55,596
[exhales sharply]

2155
01:54:57,432 --> 01:54:59,184
Hey.

2156
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:00,727
Who wants their powers back?

2157
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:01,811
[Shazam chuckles]

2158
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:04,689
We can do that, right?

2159
01:55:04,773 --> 01:55:05,816
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay, good.

2160
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:07,067
Good, good, good.

2161
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:08,860
[Victor] I'd like
our house back.

2162
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:10,070
Can we do that?

2163
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:11,988
[upbeat music playing]

2164
01:55:12,072 --> 01:55:13,865
- [Victor] Dinner!
- Coming.

2165
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:16,118
Aw. Thank you for respecting
the cross-stitch.

2166
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:19,703
[Rosa chuckles]

2167
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:22,207
[Rosa] Anthea.

2168
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:23,559
Have you decided what
you're gonna do

2169
01:55:23,583 --> 01:55:26,211
about that god realm of yours?

2170
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:28,922
Well, actually I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.

2171
01:55:29,005 --> 01:55:30,924
Spend some time
with the common folk.

2172
01:55:31,007 --> 01:55:32,509
Learn some about your world,

2173
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:35,053
about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.

2174
01:55:35,137 --> 01:55:36,763
Number one sign of wisdom:

2175
01:55:36,847 --> 01:55:38,640
Admitting there's always
more to learn.

2176
01:55:38,723 --> 01:55:39,975
I'm coming around to it.

2177
01:55:40,058 --> 01:55:41,226
[doorbell rings]

2178
01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:43,145
I got it.

2179
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:48,566
Whoa.

2180
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:50,652
Uh, guys?

2181
01:55:51,444 --> 01:55:52,445
Guys!

2182
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:54,531
[suspenseful music playing]

2183
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:00,954
It's the wizard.

2184
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:04,624
- Oh, my God!
- [Rosa] No way!

2185
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,334
- Yes.
- Look at this guy!

2186
01:56:06,418 --> 01:56:07,752
Look at him, he's so handsome.

2187
01:56:07,836 --> 01:56:09,171
You pimpin' now, what is this?

2188
01:56:09,254 --> 01:56:10,940
- [Billy] You look amazing.
- You look great!

2189
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:13,049
Well, I was in the neighborhood

2190
01:56:13,133 --> 01:56:14,718
and, um, I just wanted
to express

2191
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:17,137
- my gratitude before I go.
- [doorbell rings, pops]

2192
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:21,433
Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually, everything's broken.

2193
01:56:21,516 --> 01:56:22,976
- [Freddy chuckles]
- Not everything.

2194
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:27,731
You were just
in the neighborhood?

2195
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:30,150
[chuckles] Okay,
I came for the staff.

2196
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:32,194
Perhaps I will hold
onto it for now.

2197
01:56:32,277 --> 01:56:36,156
I also wanted to see
your faces one last time

2198
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,949
before I turn into a pile
of ash.

2199
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:39,492
- Wait, what?
- No!

2200
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:41,578
I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.

2201
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:43,455
- And besides...
- [chuckles]

2202
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:46,249
I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

2203
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:48,251
It's time to see your world.

2204
01:56:48,335 --> 01:56:49,920
It's been an honor,

2205
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:52,589
a privilege,
watching you all soar.

2206
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:54,025
You know, you're not such
a bad wizard.

2207
01:56:54,049 --> 01:56:55,425
Thank you, Jeff.

2208
01:56:55,508 --> 01:56:57,260
- [sighs] It never ends.
- [chuckles]

2209
01:56:58,720 --> 01:56:59,720
[Billy] Also,

2210
01:57:01,181 --> 01:57:02,682
what's my superhero name?

2211
01:57:05,268 --> 01:57:07,562
Your name is...

2212
01:57:08,647 --> 01:57:10,482
Shazam.

2213
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:11,566
- Of course.
- Yeah.

2214
01:57:11,650 --> 01:57:13,652
[all agreeing]

2215
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:17,614
I still think we can beat it.

2216
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:19,658
[upbeat music playing]

2217
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,483
My feet hurt.
How much further?

2218
01:59:58,566 --> 01:59:59,776
About ten seconds less

2219
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:01,361
than the last time you asked me.

2220
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:02,946
I'm sorry, I just feel
like we could

2221
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,280
have parked a little bit closer.

2222
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:05,524
He doesn't know we're coming,

2223
02:00:05,573 --> 02:00:06,991
and I didn't want to spook him.

2224
02:00:07,075 --> 02:00:09,369
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

2225
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:10,829
All right, let's go.

2226
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:12,914
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

2227
02:00:12,997 --> 02:00:15,226
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

2228
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,709
we never actually met him

2229
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:19,170
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

2230
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:21,089
[chuckles] Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

2231
02:00:21,172 --> 02:00:23,049
and they're not shitty,
they're new.

2232
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:26,052
I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet. -Shut up.

2233
02:00:26,136 --> 02:00:29,139
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

2234
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,890
but a little immature.

2235
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:32,100
Oh, great.

2236
02:00:33,017 --> 02:00:35,520
Whoo! [chuckles]

2237
02:00:40,358 --> 02:00:42,318
[grunting]

2238
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:46,030
- Billy Batson.
- Yeah?

2239
02:00:46,114 --> 02:00:47,782
I mean, no.

2240
02:00:47,866 --> 02:00:49,451
I've never heard that name
in my life.

2241
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:50,928
I don't know who
you're talking about.

2242
02:00:50,952 --> 02:00:52,454
But I'd like to meet that person

2243
02:00:52,537 --> 02:00:54,289
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

2244
02:00:54,372 --> 02:00:57,167
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

2245
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,710
but, like, in a dangerous way.

2246
02:00:58,793 --> 02:01:00,628
What the hell
are you talking about?

2247
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:02,797
Relax. We know who you are.

2248
02:01:02,881 --> 02:01:05,008
- How?
- Don't worry about that.

2249
02:01:06,092 --> 02:01:07,093
Who are you guys?

2250
02:01:07,177 --> 02:01:08,470
Don't worry about that either.

2251
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:10,305
Look, we've seen
what you can do.

2252
02:01:10,388 --> 02:01:12,015
And we're here
to make you an offer.

2253
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:13,141
How would you like to join

2254
02:01:13,224 --> 02:01:14,350
- the Justice...
- Yes!

2255
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:15,852
A thousand times yes!

2256
02:01:15,935 --> 02:01:17,770
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

2257
02:01:17,854 --> 02:01:19,772
Well, I mean, not this exactly.

2258
02:01:19,856 --> 02:01:20,916
Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman

2259
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,108
in the dream, but...

2260
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,610
- Ew.
- Huh?

2261
02:01:23,693 --> 02:01:25,820
Well, that was easy.

2262
02:01:25,904 --> 02:01:27,405
Welcome to the Justice Society.

2263
02:01:27,489 --> 02:01:29,449
Yeah! Aweso... Wait, what?

2264
02:01:29,532 --> 02:01:30,783
The Justice Society?

2265
02:01:30,867 --> 02:01:32,261
Is that different
than the Justice League?

2266
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:33,912
Yes. The Justice Society

2267
02:01:33,995 --> 02:01:35,395
is different
than the Justice League

2268
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:37,207
because of how words work.

2269
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:39,167
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

2270
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:41,461
- So, that's you guys, right?
- No.

2271
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:43,463
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

2272
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:45,381
He's joking, right?

2273
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:48,718
- No?
- Okay. I'm out.

2274
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:50,762
I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

2275
02:01:50,845 --> 02:01:52,805
Can you drive by and get me?

2276
02:01:52,889 --> 02:01:55,308
[Shazam] Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

2277
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:56,702
It's pretty confusing
that there are

2278
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,686
two separate groups
of superheroes

2279
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:00,230
that are totally unaffiliated,

2280
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:02,315
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

2281
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:04,502
Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing a rebranding of sorts?

2282
02:02:04,526 --> 02:02:07,320
'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com,

2283
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:09,197
you got so many options, man.

2284
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:12,283
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

2285
02:02:12,367 --> 02:02:14,035
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

2286
02:02:14,118 --> 02:02:15,495
These are, like, legal terms.

2287
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:18,665
[gasps] "The Avenger Society."

2288
02:02:18,748 --> 02:02:20,166
[inhales sharply]

2289
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:21,668
I like that, for some reason.

2290
02:02:24,546 --> 02:02:26,506
[gentle music playing]

2291
02:02:41,854 --> 02:02:44,023
[music builds up]

2292
02:02:50,822 --> 02:02:52,782
[dramatic music playing]

2293
02:06:06,851 --> 02:06:08,811
[mysterious music playing]

2294
02:07:35,106 --> 02:07:37,066
[intense music playing]

2295
02:08:35,333 --> 02:08:37,335
[distant chattering]

2296
02:08:37,418 --> 02:08:39,378
[unsettling music playing]

2297
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:57,146
[voice laughing]

2298
02:08:57,229 --> 02:09:01,233
[Mister Mind] Well, well,
Doctor. We meet again.

2299
02:09:01,317 --> 02:09:03,110
Where in the hell have you been?

2300
02:09:03,194 --> 02:09:06,197
[Mister Mind] To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

2301
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:08,574
one must have patience.

2302
02:09:08,658 --> 02:09:10,076
What are you talking about?

2303
02:09:11,827 --> 02:09:13,663
It's been two goddamn years!

2304
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:18,626
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

2305
02:09:18,709 --> 02:09:20,044
A meaningless measure.

2306
02:09:20,127 --> 02:09:22,713
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

2307
02:09:22,797 --> 02:09:26,008
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

2308
02:09:26,092 --> 02:09:28,010
waiting for a worm to enact
some, what,

2309
02:09:28,094 --> 02:09:30,554
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

2310
02:09:30,638 --> 02:09:33,265
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

2311
02:09:33,349 --> 02:09:36,102
I do not have legs,
I do not have wings,

2312
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:39,563
I just slither around endlessly.

2313
02:09:39,647 --> 02:09:42,066
But not for long.

2314
02:09:42,149 --> 02:09:43,609
[laughing]

2315
02:09:44,944 --> 02:09:46,570
Tell me everything.

2316
02:09:48,155 --> 02:09:50,199
Just one more thing
I need to do.

2317
02:09:50,282 --> 02:09:52,243
What? No!

2318
02:09:53,828 --> 02:09:55,371
Oh, goddamn it!
