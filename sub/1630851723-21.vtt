[music slows down]

01:37.388 --> 01:41.267
Blood leaking into the lungs
is a very common blast injury.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.104
Doctor believes
it was re-induced by sudden stress.

01:45.188 --> 01:50.110
Such as the stress of seeing
a sniper rifle aimed at her sister's head?

01:50.193 --> 01:51.194
Yes.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.948
I was conducting the fire ritual
far away from you.

01:55.031 --> 01:57.575
And yet, I still almost lost my life.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.703
And my sister hers.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.832
I'm facing a savage opponent.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.583
Why was Weecha with you?

02:06.209 --> 02:08.419
She was supposed to rest and recover.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.755
She followed me, against my advice.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.968
I have no control over the women
in my life, nor do I seek it.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.054
You're both free to come and go
as you please.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.305
We'll be going.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.521
My sister and I are as different
as the sun and the moon...

02:28.022 --> 02:30.275
but the same blood flows in our hearts

02:30.358 --> 02:33.278
and the fire ritual
has called that blood home.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.322
We're not safe here.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.201
I want to be able to come with you.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.538
This is all gonna end soon.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.759
I'll be back in a few minutes.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.928
Will you stay and be with her?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.180
What do you think, Raymond?

03:02.765 --> 03:04.267
You don't, do you?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.448
The United States Marshals Service

03:18.531 --> 03:21.701
has authorized a fugitive task force
to find Marvin Gerard.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.120
Local, state, federal agencies.

03:24.203 --> 03:27.123
I know you're looking for him too.
We should pool our resources.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.583
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

03:28.666 --> 03:30.335
-We have the same goal.
-We do?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.503
My goal is to shoot Marvin dead.
What's yours?

03:32.587 --> 03:34.213
You know the answer.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.550
With Gerard in custody,
I can prove his role as my blackmailer.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.302
Stay out of prison. Resume my life.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.930
Gerard will be tried and convicted.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.473
Twaddle.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.767
Your storybook version of events

03:45.850 --> 03:50.146
leaves out one very real consequence
of arresting Marvin Gerard.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.731
And what's that?

03:51.814 --> 03:54.609
Have you heard of the Trembling Giant?

03:55.526 --> 03:58.780
If you're hiking
through Utah's Fishlake Forest,

03:58.863 --> 04:03.576
you'll wander into the most glorious grove

04:03.660 --> 04:06.704
of quaking, quivering aspens.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.206
Fifty thousand

04:08.289 --> 04:11.084
spread over a hundred acres.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.502
What a sight.

04:12.585 --> 04:18.174
In autumn, you look up,
every leaf a flaming torch dancer.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.343
What you don't see

04:20.426 --> 04:24.055
is that the entire grove is one plant,

04:24.138 --> 04:28.643
interconnected by an enormous
underground root system

04:28.726 --> 04:33.147
that forms the largest
living organism on earth.

04:33.231 --> 04:37.110
Harold, my criminal empire
is the Trembling Giant

04:37.193 --> 04:41.698
and Marvin is one of those trees
with my roots.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.909
[Marvin] <i>Reddington's on his heels.</i>

04:44.993 --> 04:47.745
That little bodyguard of his
is on life support

04:47.829 --> 04:50.456
and the woman he loves
has one foot out the door.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.168
Your insight into your opponent's
moves is an ongoing wonder.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.795
<i>It's a survival mechanism.</i>

04:55.878 --> 04:59.132
You think I'd go to war with Reddington
if I didn't know his every move?

04:59.215 --> 05:02.135
I understand. You're worried
Gerard will expose you.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.512
Like a Central Park flasher.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.097
He's my bagman.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.474
He cuts every deal I make.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.562
And if he's taken into custody,
he'll cut one with the DOJ.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.564
Trade everything he knows.

05:14.647 --> 05:19.152
It will destroy my organization,
the Blacklist, your task force.

05:19.235 --> 05:24.365
And I will be running like a rabbit
for the rest of my foreshortened life.

05:24.449 --> 05:28.411
Reddington knows that the only option
he has left is to kill me.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.829
Now, I need to feel confident

05:29.912 --> 05:32.707
<i>that you have the capabilities</i>
<i>to deal with him.</i>

05:32.790 --> 05:37.420
I can assure you my men are unlike
anything Reddington has ever faced.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.423
Just name a time and a location.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.592
I can accept losing the task force.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.678
What I can't accept
is Agnes losing another parent.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.182
I promised I'd be there for her.
I can't keep that promise from prison.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.935
Harold, the last thing
I want to see is Agnes hurt.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.688
I'll thread this needle. I always do.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.982
You will not languish in jail.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.400
You don't know that.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.069
I can't take that leap of faith.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.905
Then we have nothing left to talk about.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.575
I know Reddington
better than he knows himself.

06:07.658 --> 06:11.829
His next move will be to consolidate
his power base, or what's left of it.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.832
<i>As soon as I know the location</i>
<i>of the meet, I'll let you know.</i>

06:14.916 --> 06:17.043
As long as it's not
in the next 14 minutes.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.920
I'm about to break my personal record.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.963
Hey, this isn't a game, Fisker.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.716
I'm paying you enough
to buy your own country.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.384
Relax, Mr. Gerard.

06:25.468 --> 06:29.430
Reddington is a dead man walking.
He just doesn't know it yet.

06:33.893 --> 06:34.852
He better be.

06:40.483 --> 06:44.070
I devote my entire life
to that son of a bitch.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.073
I helped him build an empire.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.908
I did time for him.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.702
And he's giving everything to her?

06:52.620 --> 06:56.249
He's turning it all over to Elizabeth Keen

06:56.332 --> 06:58.709
like he's buying her a damn pony?

06:58.793 --> 06:59.710
Whoa!

07:01.629 --> 07:02.630
Calm down.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.925
Sorry about that, Darcy.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.970
Put the new mirror on my card
and another round.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.140
Relax.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.602
I never know what the hell it is
between him and her.

07:16.686 --> 07:20.857
Raymond has some kind of Achilles' heel
when it comes to that woman.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.984
Doesn't she have a daughter
in grade school?

07:23.067 --> 07:23.901
Oh, yeah.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.570
But you know how crime bosses are.

07:25.653 --> 07:30.116
They schedule their business meetings
around their parent-teacher conferences.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.869
Telling you, man.

07:32.952 --> 07:37.331
I'm gonna end up doing all the work
with none of the rewards.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.711
Well, if it bothers you so much,
why don't you do something about it?

07:41.794 --> 07:45.798
Making obstacles go away.
Isn't that your job for Reddington?

07:45.882 --> 07:46.924
Reddington.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.970
He would never be
where he is today if it weren't for me.

07:59.103 --> 08:02.482
You remember that drinking game
we made up at Harvard?

08:02.565 --> 08:05.234
Yeah. The Foolhardy Boys.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.694
One of us would come up

08:06.777 --> 08:09.864
with the craziest crime
that we could think of.

08:09.947 --> 08:14.243
Then we'd take turns devising
the perfect plan to pull it off.

08:14.327 --> 08:19.207
So how would you murder an FBI agent?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.043
Better yet,

08:22.126 --> 08:25.505
how would you get your enemy
to murder her?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.340
Oh, you're getting ahead of yourself.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.717
What are her vulnerabilities?

08:29.800 --> 08:33.387
First of all, you've gotta find a way
to keep tabs on her.

08:33.471 --> 08:37.433
And I just read an article
about this new sort of GPS device

08:37.517 --> 08:39.977
that works in the form of a medical pill.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.231
-I like that right there.
-Like that?

08:43.314 --> 08:44.190
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.859
Foolhardy Boys.

08:46.943 --> 08:47.944
Foolhardy Boys.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.121
-May I speak privately with you?
-Of course, Dembe.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.248
[door closes]

09:04.544 --> 09:07.672
The man who Raymond relies on
and trusts the most

09:07.755 --> 09:10.591
in his organization has betrayed him.

09:11.175 --> 09:15.388
The woman who guards his life
is lying in a hospital bed.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.557
Raymond is at great risk right now.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.141
I'd like to be there for him.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.643
Did Reddington send you?

09:20.726 --> 09:21.561
No.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.396
But I know he needs someone.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.106
He can't win this war by himself.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.733
Are you asking for my advice
or my approval?

09:27.817 --> 09:29.777
Because Aram's in charge
of this task force.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.113
Aram has deferred to your wisdom.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.824
Well, that puts me
in a challenging position,

09:34.907 --> 09:37.368
because Reddington has a different agenda.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.953
Not so different.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.497
He wants to stop a man
from destroying his life.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.082
He wants to murder a man.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.543
I won't assist him of that.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.004
I'm an FBI agent first.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.797
But I can protect Raymond

09:49.880 --> 09:53.050
and the organization
that I was once a part of.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.137
His work is the lifeblood
of everything we do here.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.432
I can make sure that's not compromised.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.934
[Raymond] <i>Did Harold send you?</i>

10:02.018 --> 10:04.270
No. But he gave his approval.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.480
So you're here on his behalf?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.190
I'm here as your friend.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.359
I have missed you a lot.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.154
I hope it works out.

10:13.237 --> 10:16.907
Marvin has declared civil war
against me for...

10:18.951 --> 10:21.495
control of all of it.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.289
Losses are inevitable,

10:23.372 --> 10:26.042
but perhaps we can minimize them
if we move fast enough.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.128
I'll set up a meeting
with some of the players.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.713
Maybe up at the lake.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.715
Yeah, that's straight out of the playbook.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.051
Unfortunately, Marvin acquired my playbook

10:35.134 --> 10:38.721
when he stole the DVDs
I recorded for Elizabeth.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.473
We'd be walking into an ambush.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.975
The safe houses are out of the question.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.937
Marvin purchased most of them for you
and knows about the rest.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.900
I own a hunting lodge up in Owego.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.777
Up on the Susquehanna River.

10:52.860 --> 10:57.448
I bought it for Marvin years ago
as a surprise for his 50th birthday.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.451
I never gave it to him.
It would have been in poor taste.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.369
Why?

11:01.452 --> 11:03.954
Because he doesn't know
how to shoot a gun?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.874
No. I found out his girlfriend was vegan.

11:06.957 --> 11:10.670
I gave him three weeks
at a yoga retreat in Tulum instead.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.171
We'll fly up tonight.

11:12.254 --> 11:16.133
<i>Chuck, you and Santiago</i>
<i>stay with a team at the warehouse.</i>

11:16.217 --> 11:19.303
<i>Let's get word out to some</i>
<i>of the ones we know we can trust.</i>

11:19.387 --> 11:23.099
<i>Whoever can make it should be</i>
<i>at the lodge in Owego by tomorrow.</i>

11:23.182 --> 11:26.310
I know what Reddington pays you.
I cut the checks.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.937
I'm offering to double it.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.648
We've got a location. Upstate New York.
Sometime tomorrow.

11:30.731 --> 11:31.565
Call Fisker.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.942
Tell him to mobilize.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.569
We're gonna end this war
by tomorrow night.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.155
So, what do you say?

11:56.048 --> 11:58.551
If you've ever wondered
what's worse than death,

11:58.634 --> 12:00.136
I'll tell you now.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.595
Cold cheese.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.222
You see, I can conceive death.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.682
I distribute death.

12:04.765 --> 12:08.185
It's a commodity
that's generally earned in our business.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.564
But cheese straight out of the fridge,
or betrayal,

12:11.647 --> 12:13.816
I personally cannot conceive

12:13.899 --> 12:18.195
and therefore I fail to see it
coming every time.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.323
Call it my blind spot.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.241
As we speak,

12:22.324 --> 12:25.119
Marvin Gerard is using the trust
I placed in him

12:25.202 --> 12:27.746
to attempt to take over my organization.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.331
Dembe, what's the latest?

12:29.415 --> 12:32.418
You just lost your shipping corridor
out of the Middle East.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.589
Marvin Gerard now controls
the trading hub in Kuala Lumpur.

12:36.672 --> 12:39.884
Would anyone care
for some chilled Camembert?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.302
No?

12:45.222 --> 12:46.474
Bingo.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.185
We'll move on Reddington's
Balkan route next.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.938
The Russian sanctions have created
a sweet spot of instability.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.482
Is Fisker's team in place yet?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.817
-Waiting on confirmation.
-Good.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.785
[Soldier] Can I get a laser scope?

13:12.208 --> 13:17.505
[Raymond] <i>I suppose everyone has at least</i>
<i>one bad betrayal in their lifetime.</i>

13:18.255 --> 13:22.760
<i>The challenge is to not let it diminish</i>
<i>your trust and faith</i>

13:22.843 --> 13:24.803
<i>in others in the process.</i>

13:24.887 --> 13:28.390
You all are here with me in this room

13:28.474 --> 13:32.686
because you've demonstrated
tremendous reliability

13:32.770 --> 13:35.606
and loyalty over the years.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.567
You're also the ones
who could get here in time.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.987
-McDougal just arrived.
-Ah.

13:42.071 --> 13:45.658
The final member
of our little inner circle.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.660
Better late than never.

13:47.743 --> 13:51.789
Listen, I need your commitment
now more than ever.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.918
If we can remain steadfast together,

13:56.001 --> 13:57.378
vigilant,

13:57.461 --> 14:01.257
we can stop the bleeding
and put our operations back on their feet.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.800
If we don't,

14:03.425 --> 14:06.804
I fear we'll end up like poor McDougal.

14:06.887 --> 14:11.308
He accepted a payout from Marvin
for his place on the map.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.477
Wretched decision.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.438
[gunshots]

14:19.400 --> 14:20.234
So...

14:20.901 --> 14:22.778
let's talk strategy.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.660
All right, your wire transfer
went through.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.246
<i>Thank you, Mr. Gerard.</i>

14:32.329 --> 14:34.957
<i>I've arranged</i>
<i>live video feeds of the attack.</i>

14:35.040 --> 14:38.252
<i>Maybe we can get a good shot</i>
<i>of Reddington going down.</i>

14:38.335 --> 14:39.587
I don't need to see that.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.131
And I don't need for him to suffer.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.550
Tell your troops to put him down quick.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.558
[Marvin] It's a no-smoking room.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.476
The whole hotel.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.438
Didn't realize the punishment was death.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.273
Take out your piece,

14:59.356 --> 15:01.275
put it on that table,

15:01.358 --> 15:03.319
and sit in that chair over there.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.042
I work with Raymond Reddington.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.668
I gathered. How'd you find me?

15:19.752 --> 15:22.546
You were on our radar
the moment you stepped into town.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.466
Just a lone wolf out for revenge, right?

15:25.549 --> 15:30.554
Reddington just took out Neville Townsend,
your boss and mentor.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.933
A man you learned from and even idolized.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.852
A man who gave you self-worth

15:36.936 --> 15:39.313
when you were filled with self-loathing.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.732
When Neville's eyes rested on you,

15:41.815 --> 15:45.903
it was like a warmth of sunshine
on your face.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.114
And now he's gone.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.244
How do you know all that?

15:54.828 --> 15:57.414
That's who Reddington is to me.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.334
Then I'm as good as dead.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.378
Not necessarily.

16:02.461 --> 16:06.215
You see, if you really wanted
to avenge your boss,

16:06.298 --> 16:08.300
you wouldn't take out Reddington.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.760
You'd make him suffer.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.347
That's what Townsend was planning.

16:14.014 --> 16:18.352
He wanted to murder Elizabeth Keen
in front of Raymond,

16:19.061 --> 16:22.356
because that would have been
the cruelest thing

16:22.439 --> 16:23.983
that he could have done.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.319
Much, much crueler than killing him.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.572
And I can help you do it.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.032
Why?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.201
Why would you do that?

16:34.284 --> 16:36.412
I need Keen to die

16:36.495 --> 16:38.622
and Reddington to live

16:38.706 --> 16:39.999
for my own reasons.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.751
And if you can help me pull it off,

16:42.835 --> 16:46.171
you would be fulfilling
your mentor's dying wish.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.847
How do I find Keen?

16:54.930 --> 16:59.143
She'll have a GPS tracker on her person
by this time tomorrow.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.397
There's an app on here

17:03.897 --> 17:06.191
that will lead you straight to her.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.653
As soon as Reddington shows up...

17:10.571 --> 17:11.530
take her out.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.409
[tense music playing]

17:23.042 --> 17:24.293
Obviously, our first step

17:24.376 --> 17:28.630
is to stop the infection from spreading
any further than it already has.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.551
Won't be easy. Marvin started calling
my people in the middle of the night.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.220
Got most of them believing
that you've stepped down.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.264
Anyone else having cell problems?

17:37.347 --> 17:39.183
I suddenly can't get a signal.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.651
Raymond!

17:49.735 --> 17:51.361
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[gunfire]

17:52.738 --> 17:54.406
Curtains! Shut the curtains!

17:54.490 --> 17:55.824
Turn out the lights!

17:59.453 --> 18:00.287
No!

18:12.758 --> 18:14.885
Why aren't our people firing back?

18:14.968 --> 18:17.221
Nobody in sight. Nothing to shoot at.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.472
Single shooter?

18:18.555 --> 18:19.515
Not likely.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.810
-How about I spray the trees and find out?
-No, no, no!

18:22.893 --> 18:23.977
[gunfire]

18:25.312 --> 18:26.647
Stay down low.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.107
How did he find us?

18:28.190 --> 18:31.568
I don't know, but whatever army
they hired, they're combat trained.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.946
We need more guys. Bigger guns.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.372
Line's cut.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.083
Cell phones out.
They must be jamming the signals.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.256
[radio static]

18:53.882 --> 18:55.175
CB radio?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.802
Creepy, huh?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.887
Ten-four, good buddy.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.935
I just got a call from a trucker
on the Southern Tier Expressway.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.021
He received a distress call
on his CB radio from a Mr. Homan

19:08.105 --> 19:09.857
who's under heavy fire.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.150
He gave me coordinates.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.901
I'll scramble an HRT chopper.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.238
Make it three with full tactical support.
Have them on our roof in five.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.116
Agent Ressler, gear up.
You're in charge of the TAC team.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.746
How long is this gonna take?

19:24.830 --> 19:27.541
<i>Their ammunition won't last long.</i>

19:27.624 --> 19:30.085
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>you paid for this entertainment.</i>

19:30.169 --> 19:32.212
<i>Sit back and enjoy the show.</i>

19:35.174 --> 19:38.760
-[pop music playing]
-Who is ready for a good time?

19:38.844 --> 19:40.512
-Party!
-Whoo!

19:40.596 --> 19:42.681
Tyson, really? I got work here.

19:42.764 --> 19:43.891
This is Polly.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.518
And this is Esther.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.769
Polyester.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.689
-Their real names. Can you believe it?
-No.

19:50.772 --> 19:54.526
I got an antiquities shipment
stalled at a checkpoint in Geneva.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.944
I got to deal with it.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.488
Play now, work later.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.657
We are the Foolhardy Boys.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.869
Enjoy the spoils of your empire.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.037
Okay, get out.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.747
Come on, get the hell out.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.082
-Go. Move. Get them out of here.
-Okay. Okay.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.085
It's okay, it's okay.
He's not normally like this.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.421
It's okay. I'll call you later.

20:14.504 --> 20:15.464
[door closes]

20:17.007 --> 20:18.383
What is wrong with you?

20:18.467 --> 20:21.136
I had a message
on my voicemail this morning.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.430
He's coming back.

20:24.681 --> 20:25.515
Wait, no.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.352
It's been, what,
two years since he took off?

20:29.686 --> 20:31.480
I was hoping he was dead.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.190
Well, he's not.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.651
-Where's he been?
-I don't know.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.612
Central America, South America.

20:38.695 --> 20:41.031
He was only in touch sporadically.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.201
He'll be here tomorrow.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.330
Maybe you should just take him out
when he shows up.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.333
I can't.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.086
He's my friend.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.463
[gunfire]

20:58.840 --> 21:00.050
This is my last mag.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.134
Mine too.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.179
I don't think we can hold them off
before they breach the lodge.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.014
You think Harold got the message?

21:06.098 --> 21:08.308
Well, the trucker's handle
was "Spanky Britches,"

21:08.392 --> 21:10.519
so we got that going for us.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.979
Down, down!

21:12.938 --> 21:14.314
Oh, bother.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.942
Come on.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.542
Hiding in the pantry?

21:33.625 --> 21:36.837
-It's undignified. The fight's out there.
-Shh.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.130
Hold still.

21:38.922 --> 21:42.050
You can't shoot
if you can't hold the weapon straight.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.553
You're a great friend.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.347
I've missed you a lot.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.850
Have I said that already?

21:51.643 --> 21:53.603
If there's any comfort in knowing

21:53.687 --> 21:57.399
that there's one person in your life
that will never betray you,

21:58.066 --> 21:59.818
then take that comfort now.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.029
There.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.907
Oh, look, a duck call.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.164
I had one like this when I was a kid.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.166
[gunfire]

22:17.627 --> 22:18.628
They're inside.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.173
You ready?

22:22.549 --> 22:23.967
To die, you mean?

22:24.676 --> 22:27.304
Dembe, I've been living
the bonus round for years.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.599
[blowing duck whistle]

22:30.682 --> 22:33.852
Stop, stop! Don't shoot!
Friendlies! Friendlies!

22:36.104 --> 22:37.773
Is that a duck whistle?

22:39.608 --> 22:41.234
Are any of my people alive?

22:41.318 --> 22:43.779
Some. Ambulances are on their way.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.947
We arrived just after
the attackers breached,

22:46.031 --> 22:47.741
but we were able to drive them out.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.660
-Where are the bodies?
-There were none.

22:50.744 --> 22:54.664
I know we got some of them,
but these guys had full body armor on.

22:54.748 --> 22:57.793
Assault rifles. I mean, they looked like
some kind of a death squad.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.086
Dembe.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.634
You're welcome.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.262
Thank you.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.163
Boo.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.294
How did Marvin know we were here?

23:41.378 --> 23:45.006
I don't know. Maybe another one
of your people sold you out.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.759
One of the dead
or wounded inside? Unlikely.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.554
Well, the only people
who knew about this lodge

23:50.637 --> 23:53.056
were the people inside that we called.

23:53.765 --> 23:54.808
From the car.

23:55.433 --> 23:56.351
The car.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.322
Here it is. I've switched it off.

24:12.409 --> 24:16.580
We have to assume Marvin put
one of these anywhere he had access to.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.582
Which is everywhere.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.334
How do you wanna handle this?

24:21.418 --> 24:23.545
We swept the jet, and the warehouse.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.965
We should clean the Airstream
and anywhere else we go.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.342
But put this back in.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.970
We may be able
to use that to our advantage.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.316
How is she?

24:44.941 --> 24:45.942
Stable.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.404
You don't look so good yourself.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.040
Please don't go.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.168
Not yet, Mierce.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.754
I want you to stay. Both of you.

25:06.296 --> 25:11.343
I've just struck on a plan
that will make it safe for you to stay.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.906
There, that's better.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.784
Now at least you look like him.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.328
Like who?

25:38.828 --> 25:40.163
Buluc Chabtan,

25:40.747 --> 25:45.085
the Mayan god of war,
violent death and human sacrifice.

25:46.253 --> 25:49.214
Nobody will ever be safe
around you, Raymond.

25:58.515 --> 25:59.474
An army.

25:59.557 --> 26:02.269
I bought a literal army,

26:02.352 --> 26:04.145
<i>and Reddington is still alive.</i>

26:04.229 --> 26:07.565
You paid for services that you'll receive.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.317
These things take time.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.279
But he was at a lodge
in the middle of nowhere.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.490
Do you know how hard it is
to find a perfect situation like that?

26:15.573 --> 26:18.034
No offense, but it was far from perfect.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.912
The man was surrounded
by his people, all of them armed.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.581
Fine. We'll pick the next point of attack.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.127
I'll find a place for us to meet.
We'll figure this out.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.254
[cell phone beeps]

26:29.796 --> 26:31.006
Damn.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.010
So you're back to being the number two.

26:35.802 --> 26:39.389
-Worse things could happen.
-And they will happen, my friend.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.600
That man raises obsession to a new level.

26:42.684 --> 26:46.313
As soon as he's back,
all he'll think about is Elizabeth Keen.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.316
But that's handled.
The perfect crime, right?

26:49.399 --> 26:51.985
Some guy pulled the trigger for you,
and he's dead too.

26:52.068 --> 26:56.239
No, no, no. See, Raymond will find
that loose thread to pull.

26:56.323 --> 26:59.617
He will keep pulling at it
and pulling at it and pulling at it,

26:59.701 --> 27:01.953
until he's unraveled the whole poncho.

27:02.037 --> 27:05.665
And I'll be exposed as the traitor,
shivering underneath.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.543
Okay. So, what options do you have?

27:08.626 --> 27:09.794
I don't know.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.049
I might be safe
if I could take away his best tool.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.427
He has an entire FBI team in his pocket.

27:17.510 --> 27:20.430
So how do we get them in your pocket?

27:21.598 --> 27:24.934
Hmm. The lead guy, Cooper.

27:25.435 --> 27:29.689
Maybe there's a way I leverage him,
turn him into my tool,

27:30.190 --> 27:32.901
somehow do a frame up?

27:32.984 --> 27:37.155
I got a guy, a reliable guy, former NYPD.
Reggie Cole. Knows all the tricks.

27:37.238 --> 27:40.533
We've pulled some scams together.
Maybe Reggie can figure out a way

27:40.617 --> 27:42.786
to knock this guy on his ass
for a couple hours.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.079
[inaudible dialogue]

27:53.338 --> 27:56.591
When he's out cold, you could plant
some bogus evidence on him.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.885
Or maybe when he's out cold,

27:58.968 --> 28:02.722
we borrow his service weapon
and shoot someone?

28:02.806 --> 28:04.682
It's the only way to do it right.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.977
We get rid of someone
that he has the motive to kill.

28:11.856 --> 28:15.527
After a good night's sleep,
Cooper wakes up in a strange place,

28:15.610 --> 28:20.698
and I'm holding the strings
to make him dance.

28:23.868 --> 28:24.953
[door closes]

28:25.036 --> 28:27.539
[Ressler] The numbers are rolling in,
11 dead so far.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.750
That's 11 murder charges,
maybe more on the way.

28:30.834 --> 28:34.087
You really gonna take the fall
for your entire team?

28:34.170 --> 28:35.588
[cell phone chiming]

28:37.132 --> 28:39.008
-Cooper here.
-[Raymond] <i>Harold.</i>

28:39.092 --> 28:42.387
I'm calling to thank you
for saving my life

28:42.470 --> 28:44.305
and Dembe's and the others.

28:44.389 --> 28:47.016
Red, as hellbent as you are
on finding Gerard

28:47.100 --> 28:48.601
to satisfy your purposes,

28:48.685 --> 28:51.730
I'm just as hellbent
on finding him to satisfy mine.

28:51.813 --> 28:55.316
What progress have you made
with the operative you captured?

28:55.400 --> 28:58.486
Very little. Though I must say,
with us working at cross purposes,

28:58.570 --> 29:00.739
I'm very reticent
to tell you anything, anyway.

29:00.822 --> 29:05.535
I give you my word. If I can figure out
who your man in custody works for,

29:05.618 --> 29:07.412
I'll tell you right away.

29:08.121 --> 29:11.040
Harold, describe him in detail.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.797
Light eyes, fair hair and skin.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.175
Extremely fit, military bearing.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.094
Any unique body features or scars?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.846
Embarrassing tattoos?

29:24.929 --> 29:28.391
White nationalist iconography,
mark of the beast?

29:28.475 --> 29:32.771
Our attending physician said he once
had multiple tattoos on his arms,

29:32.854 --> 29:34.439
<i>but they've been removed.</i>

29:34.522 --> 29:36.399
You may have hit pay dirt.

29:36.483 --> 29:39.611
Henrick insists on laser tattoo removal,

29:39.694 --> 29:44.616
so if any of his soldiers get captured by
the authorities, they can't be identified.

29:45.241 --> 29:48.703
-You're looking for Henrick Fisker.
-Who is Henrick Fisker?

29:48.787 --> 29:52.707
That was the extent of our deal, Harold.
Happy hunting.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.004
Henrick Fisker.

29:59.088 --> 30:01.049
What was his pilot's name?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.093
Gomez something?

30:04.177 --> 30:05.136
Gomez.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.514
Edward used to fly choppers with him.

30:08.097 --> 30:10.225
I'll bet Fisker's still in New York.

30:10.308 --> 30:13.353
We need to get to him before the FBI does.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.108
[Cooper] Our target is Henrick Fisker,

30:19.192 --> 30:23.238
former captain of the MJK,
Norway's Special Operations Commando Unit.

30:23.321 --> 30:27.158
He led successful operations
against the Taliban in Afghanistan

30:27.242 --> 30:29.744
and conducted
anti-piracy raids in Somalia.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.955
After his military service, Fisker formed

30:32.038 --> 30:35.041
an international mercenary army
of highly paid ex-commandos,

30:35.124 --> 30:38.002
accepting only those who could
survive his training techniques.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.087
Not all of them did.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.840
My contact at Interpol said
they have six confirmed deaths

30:41.923 --> 30:43.967
of men who died
trying to make Fisker's army.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.094
They were tough in the field,
that's for sure.

30:46.177 --> 30:50.348
So Gerard used Reddington's money
to buy an army to kill Reddington.

30:50.431 --> 30:52.433
I'd be pissed. We have any leads?

30:52.517 --> 30:54.978
Not yet. And Reddington's
working against us on this.

30:55.061 --> 30:59.899
Whoever reaches Fisker first may win
the race to Gerard, so let's get on it.

31:13.538 --> 31:14.497
[Raymond] Henrick.

31:15.456 --> 31:19.168
While your troops may be like
some horde marching out of Mordor,

31:19.252 --> 31:21.880
it turns out your helicopter pilot is not.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.591
I just had a lovely chat with Gomez.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.552
What a sweet guy,
mutual friends and all that.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.470
He sent his regrets by the way.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.807
That's not the way he put it,
but, anyhoo, Gomez told me

31:32.891 --> 31:37.353
he was supposed to pick you up here
to fly you to D.C. to meet with Gerard.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.690
I need to know when and where
that meeting is scheduled.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.191
Don't waste your time.

31:42.275 --> 31:46.195
When my client buys my army,
he buys my loyalty.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.365
Oh, for heaven's sake.
You're a mercenary. You have no loyalty.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.618
-I'm a soldier.
-You're a killer for hire.

31:51.701 --> 31:52.994
How much do you want?

31:54.412 --> 31:55.705
I won't sell him out.

31:55.788 --> 32:01.044
[scoffs] You know, Henrick,
extracting the information I need

32:01.127 --> 32:04.213
from unwilling participants is,
without a doubt,

32:04.297 --> 32:06.799
the most tedious part of my job.

32:06.883 --> 32:10.470
But in your case,
with your legendary survival training,

32:10.553 --> 32:11.846
this might be fun.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.389
Why, you enjoy torture?

32:13.473 --> 32:15.725
No. Bobbing for apples.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.360
He's really quite calm under there.

32:25.443 --> 32:26.361
How long, Red?

32:27.445 --> 32:28.988
Till he's breathing water.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.788
Okay. Thanks for trying.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.503
Hey. Just checking in.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.505
I talked to Homeland. They've got nothing.

32:45.588 --> 32:48.341
No intel on Fisker's location
or base of operations.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.843
Okay, thank you, but I'm checking on you.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.012
I know how much you hate
riding a desk. Sorry.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.848
Don't be.
I'm not fit for the field right now.

32:55.932 --> 32:59.644
My migraines are getting worse.
Now they're coming with nausea.

32:59.727 --> 33:02.605
Nausea too?
Have you thought about medical leave?

33:02.689 --> 33:06.609
No. I want to help the team
find Gerard before Reddington does

33:06.693 --> 33:08.778
and keep Cooper out of jail.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.416
There's actually no fun in this at all.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.001
How long has it been now?

33:23.751 --> 33:26.546
Oh, my. Eighteen minutes.

33:26.629 --> 33:29.173
What's the world record, I wonder?

33:36.472 --> 33:38.016
[gasping]

33:41.728 --> 33:46.607
When we're young,
we feel so invulnerable, invincible.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.401
Sadly, we're not.

33:49.444 --> 33:53.865
No matter how strong the will
or well-trained the body and mind,

33:53.948 --> 33:58.453
we're just organic matter
slowly decomposing in bags of skin.

33:58.536 --> 34:02.665
I'm happy to have provided
this late life lesson for you.

34:02.749 --> 34:07.128
The question is, have you learned from it,
or is it back in the tub?

34:09.589 --> 34:10.798
[phone rings]

34:11.674 --> 34:12.800
Agent Mojtabai.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.137
Guys, it's Dembe. They found Fisker.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.556
Agent Zuma, you're on with the team.

34:18.639 --> 34:22.226
I'm sending you an address
where you can pick up Fisker.

34:22.310 --> 34:25.229
-Is he alive?
<i>-Yes. Raymond wanted to kill him,</i>

34:25.313 --> 34:28.399
<i>but I convinced him to allow</i>
<i>the task force to make the arrest.</i>

34:28.483 --> 34:32.028
Reddington wouldn't leave Fisker behind
unless you knew Marvin's location.

34:32.111 --> 34:34.489
We know where Marvin will be
in an hour and a half.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.824
<i>He and Fisker were to meet.</i>
<i>We're heading there.</i>

34:36.908 --> 34:40.244
Tell us where. You cannot let Reddington
get to Gerard before us.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.747
<i>-You know the stakes.</i>
-I can't share that.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.290
Sorry, I made a promise.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.959
You made a promise
to the Department of Justice as well.

34:47.043 --> 34:50.171
You're in the FBI.
If you let Reddington shoot Gerard,

34:50.254 --> 34:52.882
you're an accomplice to murder.
You'll lose everything.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.176
Dembe, we're trying
to keep Cooper out of jail.

34:55.259 --> 34:59.514
I promised Raymond I wouldn't tell you
where we're meeting Marvin, and I won't.

34:59.597 --> 35:03.226
But Fisker might. Maybe you can
see a way to make him talk.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.437
[cell phone beeps]

35:07.772 --> 35:10.108
I've got an address.
Agent Ressler, with me.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.611
You know what this case means to me,
and we're running out of time.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.906
I wanna be there when we reach Fisker,
with your permission.

35:16.989 --> 35:20.201
Oh, my gosh. Of course.
You go with Agent Ressler.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.370
Agent Park and I
will hold down the fort here.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.212
Target arrives in about 45.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.339
Take him alive, but just in case,

35:33.422 --> 35:36.217
I want shooters outside,
covering the exits.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.303
You do not let that man
leave this building alone.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.013
What if he brings his army?

35:41.097 --> 35:44.809
He can't. He's expecting to meet
the commander of his army here.

35:44.892 --> 35:48.938
-He could be expecting a trap too.
-Normally, I'd agree, Chuck.

35:49.021 --> 35:52.066
Marvin has the survival instincts
of a cockroach.

35:52.567 --> 35:56.779
But we'll make sure that this time,
he doesn't see the heel coming down.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.745
-[Dembe] <i>Yes?</i>
-I'm at the warehouse. Can you pick me up?

36:04.829 --> 36:08.541
-Where are we going?
<i>-We need a secure location to regroup.</i>

36:08.624 --> 36:11.294
<i>Julio offered his penthouse</i>
<i>on Park Avenue.</i>

36:11.377 --> 36:15.506
<i>He's got a great chef, and no army</i>
<i>will make a raid on a Manhattan high-rise.</i>

36:15.590 --> 36:17.967
<i>Besides, we've dealt</i>
<i>with Julio's doormen before.</i>

36:18.050 --> 36:19.468
<i>They're not to be trifled with.</i>

36:19.552 --> 36:22.638
<i>I could barely get my dry cleaning</i>
<i>delivered last time we were there.</i>

36:22.722 --> 36:23.806
<i>I'll call the jet.</i>

36:25.474 --> 36:26.809
I got you.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.646
You're not actually gonna roll
an army down Park Avenue?

36:30.730 --> 36:31.647
Don't be dense.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.859
I know the landing strip
they use outside New York.

36:34.942 --> 36:39.030
I'll tell Fisker as soon as I see him.
And when Reddington steps off his jet,

36:39.614 --> 36:42.825
he can say hello to a hail of bullets.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.964
No blood, no gunshot wounds.
How did Reddington make you talk?

36:57.048 --> 37:01.302
Where'd they go? Where'd you tell them
you were meeting Marvin Gerard?

37:04.347 --> 37:05.514
Where?

37:06.432 --> 37:10.144
There's nothing in it for me,
except a bullet from Reddington.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.896
And unlike you,

37:12.647 --> 37:14.148
he will pull the trigger.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.237
[Cooper] So why did Dembe send us here?

37:19.320 --> 37:23.532
He specifically said, "Maybe you can
see a way to make him talk."

37:24.408 --> 37:27.119
Sounds odd. "See a way to make him talk."

37:31.874 --> 37:35.753
It's got a built-in microphone.
We need to find the security room.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.514
[cell phone ringing]

37:50.476 --> 37:51.978
Well, this is unexpected.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.729
You're slipping.

37:53.813 --> 37:57.775
The old Raymond would've never been caught
with his pants down inside that lodge.

37:57.858 --> 37:59.694
How many did you lose?

37:59.777 --> 38:01.779
The battle was yours. I can't deny that.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.824
But the key to winning a war
is to know your enemy,

38:04.907 --> 38:08.160
and, Marvin, I can read you
like <i>One Fish, Two Fish.</i>

38:08.244 --> 38:09.912
You think you know me?

38:09.996 --> 38:11.998
Do you really, you son of a bitch?

38:12.081 --> 38:14.542
Here's what I think. You're done.

38:14.625 --> 38:18.254
You'd be circling your wagons right now,
if you had any wagons left to circle.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.922
[Aram] <i>Where are they meeting?</i>

38:20.006 --> 38:22.591
Culpeper Regional Airport.
Ressler just left on a chopper.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.803
Second one's on the way to transport me
and Fisker to the Post Office.

38:25.886 --> 38:28.889
-Culpeper is 70 miles southwest of D.C.
-When's the meeting start?

38:28.973 --> 38:30.433
Anytime now.

38:30.516 --> 38:35.938
I'm gonna make you a one-time offer,
out of respect for our shared history.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.106
Walk away.

38:37.189 --> 38:39.150
I'm quite comfortable where I am.

38:39.233 --> 38:42.778
I'm serious. Take your women
and go back to the jungle.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.113
You were happy there.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.866
-And what if I don't?
<i>-I'll tell you what if you don't.</i>

38:46.949 --> 38:51.162
I'm about to walk into a meeting
that's guaranteed to seal your fate.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.039
'Cause I got your number, pal.

38:53.122 --> 38:57.376
I know exactly where you are
at every minute of every day.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.713
I know where you're going to be
before you even do.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.050
You were saying, Marvin?

39:06.093 --> 39:07.303
Here's the airport.

39:07.386 --> 39:10.222
Ressler's helicopter
is still 30 miles out, here.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.141
He won't make it.

39:15.227 --> 39:16.479
Take him to holding.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.813
[cell phone chiming]

39:20.358 --> 39:23.444
-Dembe. Are you at the airport?
-No. I'm driving now.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.237
Ressler's on his way by air.

39:26.947 --> 39:28.282
But not in time.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.659
Reddington will kill Gerard,
and we can't stop him.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.244
Oh, I think you can.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.375
I should have shot you
the day you came back.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.919
-Why didn't you?
-Why do you think?

39:40.002 --> 39:42.046
Everything I did, I did for you.

39:42.546 --> 39:43.881
You just can't see it.

39:44.757 --> 39:49.053
You took Elizabeth's life from me.
I loved her more than anyone on earth.

39:49.136 --> 39:52.598
You were going to give
that young lady our life's work.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.767
It wasn't fair.

39:54.850 --> 39:57.103
No. It wasn't fair.

39:57.186 --> 40:00.981
This is FBI Agent Cooper. I need to speak
to your operations manager.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.526
You have a developing crisis
at your airport.

40:03.609 --> 40:06.987
If it wasn't fair, why did you do it?

40:07.071 --> 40:09.156
Why did you force my hand, Raymond?

40:11.909 --> 40:14.870
Because I know something
about you that you don't.

40:14.954 --> 40:18.249
Something I saw in your eyes 30 years ago,

40:18.332 --> 40:22.211
the day I interviewed you
to serve as my personal solicitor.

40:23.337 --> 40:24.463
What's that?

40:25.089 --> 40:27.133
The void inside you,

40:28.092 --> 40:30.094
and my power to fill it.

40:30.886 --> 40:32.555
From that day forward,

40:32.638 --> 40:35.558
I knew that I would be your older brother,

40:35.641 --> 40:37.768
your teacher, your pagan idol,

40:37.852 --> 40:41.188
your hope and dread and rapture.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.858
I knew that you were mine.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.652
You aren't a leader,
and you never will be.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.779
You were destined to serve.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.948
So come quietly,

40:51.031 --> 40:54.285
and none of these good people
around us will get hurt.

40:54.368 --> 40:55.578
[alarm blaring]

40:58.080 --> 41:00.624
You smug bastard. Screw you!

41:00.708 --> 41:05.296
Your attention. Please evacuate
immediately through the nearest exit,

41:05.379 --> 41:08.382
-and await instructions...
-Check the gates. Find him.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.677
-I repeat, please evacuate immediately...
-Check the other gate.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.554
[suspenseful music playing]

41:29.904 --> 41:33.032
Louis! Go down to the baggage claim area.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.409
Did you tell Harold?

41:36.035 --> 41:39.455
There was a camera on the rooftop.
I think they watched the footage.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.294
[cell phone chiming]

41:46.128 --> 41:46.962
Harold Cooper.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.423
You have no idea what you've done.

41:50.549 --> 41:53.719
I told you from the beginning.
I couldn't let you kill him.

41:53.802 --> 41:56.305
I couldn't let you do it
to me or to Agnes.

41:56.388 --> 41:59.141
Well, you just did it to you,
and you just did it to Agnes,

41:59.225 --> 42:02.561
because we've lost him,
Elizabeth's killer and your blackmailer.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.855
<i>This burns you as much as it does me.</i>

42:04.939 --> 42:06.732
My team won't give up the search.

42:06.815 --> 42:10.027
Your team? Your team doesn't
function without my team.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.779
<i>I'll tell you what else you've lost.</i>

42:11.862 --> 42:15.115
You've lost me,
your most important friend and ally.

42:21.455 --> 42:23.457
