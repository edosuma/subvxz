Well, you are going to tolerate me...

25:49.845 --> 25:52.280
so you can stay in business.

25:52.298 --> 25:54.605
Our lawyers are gonna keep
you in court for decades.

25:54.607 --> 25:56.718
[chuckles]

25:56.720 --> 25:59.862
Now, if you wanna walk away from
our generosity, that's on you.

25:59.864 --> 26:01.414
Greg.

26:01.416 --> 26:02.721
Sit down.

26:02.723 --> 26:04.945
Yeah, Greg, sit down.

26:04.947 --> 26:06.958
[laughs]

26:06.960 --> 26:09.535
You don't pull in
millions like Fox News,

26:09.537 --> 26:11.700
and dollars are viewers.

26:11.950 --> 26:15.489
You've been struggling ever since
this network expanded five years ago.

26:15.491 --> 26:19.522
And the reverse gentrification
plan isn't working out.

26:19.774 --> 26:22.688
Now, Mary Jane Paul,
she is pretty and smart.

26:22.690 --> 26:24.589
Hell, the girl is fine.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.679
But even she cannot help you

26:28.734 --> 26:30.887
compete with all these new
plans.

26:30.889 --> 26:33.475
Buzzfeed has got Pulitzer Prize

26:33.477 --> 26:35.664
winners on its staff.

26:35.665 --> 26:37.384
And more kids get news off

26:37.386 --> 26:40.326
of Facebook than their TVs these
days.

26:40.328 --> 26:43.486
But I'm telling you
what you already know.

26:44.316 --> 26:46.985
Like how much of
your salaries paid for

26:46.987 --> 26:48.834
by advertisers.

26:48.837 --> 26:50.485
Advertisers

26:51.048 --> 26:53.636
who don't wanna hear
that their lead anchor

26:53.639 --> 26:55.473
is an alcoholic.

26:55.475 --> 26:58.423
Worse yet, a drunk driver.

26:59.853 --> 27:02.433
Are you familiar with MADD?

27:04.289 --> 27:06.454
You seem to have
quite a bit to say.

27:06.456 --> 27:09.348
Well informed, I give you that.

27:09.352 --> 27:10.480
Yeah.

27:10.481 --> 27:13.046
Contrary to the myth,

27:13.482 --> 27:15.245
black people read.

27:15.247 --> 27:16.303
[laughs]

27:16.575 --> 27:20.399
Part of the deal requires
confidentiality.

27:20.552 --> 27:23.233
I'll need that document signed.

27:23.236 --> 27:24.469
Mm.

27:24.472 --> 27:26.846
And my needs?

27:28.249 --> 27:31.318
I'll personally
throw in another 10K.

27:31.531 --> 27:35.702
Let's say $100,000,
and you sign today.

27:36.052 --> 27:37.067
Or...

27:37.513 --> 27:40.567
you and my lawyers can
discuss it further in arbitration.

27:41.279 --> 27:42.550
Mm.

27:45.456 --> 27:46.868

29:49.683 --> 29:51.307
I had to see for myself.

29:54.567 --> 29:57.031
Hey, I got you.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.869
- Don't do that.
- What?

29:59.870 --> 30:01.852
- Come on, say it.
- What is it about him?

30:02.519 --> 30:03.861
What is it about him?

30:05.661 --> 30:08.236
I have been asking myself
that forever.

30:08.239 --> 30:09.754
I don't... I don't know.

30:09.756 --> 30:10.802
Maybe...

30:11.154 --> 30:13.108
maybe he reminds me of dad.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.435
You know, because he's

30:14.773 --> 30:17.889
successful, and he's handsome,
and...

30:18.685 --> 30:21.606
I believed him when he
told me he loved me.

30:23.259 --> 30:25.458
What did you overhear that
made you smash your face?

30:27.251 --> 30:29.001
- Them betraying me.
- Wait.

30:29.868 --> 30:31.965
- They were in the actual act?
- No.

30:32.288 --> 30:35.225
Well, I don't know...
I don't... I don't think so.

30:35.227 --> 30:36.475
Then what?

30:36.710 --> 30:39.078
The details are not
important.

30:40.205 --> 30:42.664
What is important is that you
shouldn't be here by yourself.

30:43.594 --> 30:46.610
You shouldn't have to hire some
cleaning lady to take care of you.

30:48.008 --> 30:50.512
All right? Somebody should be here,
and not just your little brother.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.303
- Mom came.- Or your mother.

30:56.731 --> 30:59.586
You know, she... she walked
into the glass.

30:59.589 --> 31:02.166
- I heard.
- Hard. - Hard.

31:02.167 --> 31:04.706
[laughing]

31:04.709 --> 31:06.787
But dad...

31:08.094 --> 31:10.294
dad insisted that
he come pick her up.

31:11.734 --> 31:13.593
You know, he was here within

31:13.996 --> 31:16.596
30 minutes of my call.

31:17.915 --> 31:19.805
And, PJ, when he walked
through that door,

31:20.079 --> 31:22.644
he didn't look for his daughter
that was, you know,

31:22.646 --> 31:24.303
almost killed in a car accident.

31:24.304 --> 31:26.216
He looked for her.

31:27.517 --> 31:30.635
He needed to put his eyes on
her.

31:32.914 --> 31:34.304
I want that.

31:35.109 --> 31:37.324
You know, I want... I want that.

31:39.531 --> 31:40.601
And...

31:41.461 --> 31:44.254
unfortunately, I put all of
my eggs in David's basket

31:44.256 --> 31:45.443
and...

31:46.953 --> 31:48.975
it's... it's just too hard

31:48.977 --> 31:52.169
to find a good one, like start
over.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.475
It's too hard.

31:54.944 --> 31:56.284
You know, my dumb ass

31:56.286 --> 31:58.939
actually thought it was
David at the door.

31:58.999 --> 32:00.996
Men like David don't know
how to show up.

32:01.689 --> 32:05.463
I mean, that's the type of guy
that's been coddled his whole life.

32:05.869 --> 32:07.420
That's a bitch-made man.

32:07.456 --> 32:09.711
I mean, not to call his mom a bitch,

32:09.713 --> 32:11.135
but you know what I'm saying.

32:11.408 --> 32:14.884
And the brothers with the silver
spoons, those are the worst.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.798
Says the brother with a
silver spoon in his mouth.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.129
I was getting to me.

32:18.131 --> 32:20.366
- Okay, okay.
- Damn, I was getting to me.

32:20.369 --> 32:21.720
Look,

32:21.766 --> 32:24.337
- I know I have a strain...
- A strain?

32:24.339 --> 32:26.591
A strain of that trait, too.

32:27.372 --> 32:29.200
See, we silver spoon brothers think

32:29.723 --> 32:31.808
just because we went to
private school or

32:31.962 --> 32:33.133
we're never jailed,

32:33.290 --> 32:35.415
black women should be happy
they're in our presence.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.852
I get away with that every
single day.

32:38.228 --> 32:39.636
But I'm only 28.

32:39.638 --> 32:41.007
And I promised the parents

32:41.009 --> 32:43.584
that I'd stop running through
women like that when I'm 30.

32:44.577 --> 32:47.783
- What's your point, PJ?
- I'm trying to help you.

32:47.783 --> 32:49.947
When a man's been
catering to his whole life,

32:50.181 --> 32:52.360
because his
family's got money or...

32:52.376 --> 32:54.860
or he's pretty and
the right shade of light,

32:55.251 --> 32:56.930
he doesn't know how to
work for anything.

32:57.330 --> 32:58.922
I believe David loves you.

32:59.071 --> 33:00.116
I do.

33:00.525 --> 33:01.827
But fight for you?

33:01.829 --> 33:04.682
Be there for you?
Show up for you?

33:04.800 --> 33:06.337
Y'all are letting us ruin you.

33:06.472 --> 33:08.089
Stop, say no to us.

33:08.092 --> 33:09.638
We do.

33:09.641 --> 33:11.258
Look, we do.

33:11.259 --> 33:12.382
Hmm-mm.

33:12.386 --> 33:14.672
Hmm-hmm.

33:14.673 --> 33:16.184
We have needs, too, though.

33:16.186 --> 33:18.401
- Y'all say it's about sex.
- It is about sex.

33:18.403 --> 33:20.373
No, it ain't.
You all can masturbate for that.

33:20.374 --> 33:23.129
Who the hell wants to diddle
themselves for 40 years?

33:23.648 --> 33:25.317
Huh? You?

33:25.619 --> 33:28.326
Exactly. I'm a human being.

33:28.328 --> 33:30.690
I was... I was created
to be touched.

33:31.522 --> 33:32.677
Women...

33:33.857 --> 33:35.491
women are beautiful

33:35.492 --> 33:36.798
and...

33:37.242 --> 33:39.425
created to be desired,

33:39.426 --> 33:41.051
you know? I wanna be

33:41.160 --> 33:43.687
told that I'm beautiful

33:43.839 --> 33:46.486
and that I cannot be lived without.

33:47.222 --> 33:50.031
I really don't think that we were
put on this Earth to be alone.

33:50.032 --> 33:51.602
I just... I just have to

33:52.555 --> 33:54.556
remind myself of that

33:55.481 --> 33:56.738
all the time.

33:58.323 --> 34:00.504
- You know what I mean?
- Letta,

34:01.254 --> 34:03.834
you're a complicated
and challenging woman.

34:03.837 --> 34:05.317
And that is beautiful.

34:06.153 --> 34:07.699
But you gotta be able to recognize

34:07.701 --> 34:09.753
that not every man is
cut out to deal with that.

34:12.125 --> 34:13.786
When everything
comes easy to a man,

34:13.789 --> 34:16.657
the last thing he's cut out
to do is fight for

34:16.659 --> 34:18.237
a difficult woman.

beautiful way, okay?

I... I'm... I'm sorry

37:31.206 --> 37:34.024
that I spent the last year
saving black men

37:34.026 --> 37:35.566
from suicide when

37:36.023 --> 37:37.865
you were sitting right in front of me.

37:38.865 --> 37:41.865
I'm sorry I selfishly

37:42.154 --> 37:44.834
couldn't see you
because I knew that

37:44.838 --> 37:47.595
I would have to then
really look at myself.

37:48.577 --> 37:51.161
And then I would have to consider
the possibility that maybe...

37:52.725 --> 37:54.950
I too am unhappy.

37:55.180 --> 37:58.203
And then worry that my unhappiness
is actually really...

37:59.265 --> 38:00.475
another word for depressed.

38:00.477 --> 38:03.892
And if I'm depressed,
then could I also kill myself?

38:04.229 --> 38:06.314
So I'm... I'm sorry that

38:06.783 --> 38:09.148
I was so afraid of my own fragility

38:09.150 --> 38:10.819
that I could not see yours.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.907
You don't owe me an apology.

38:13.138 --> 38:14.289
Mary Jane, I just...

38:14.291 --> 38:16.259
Do you really think

38:16.260 --> 38:18.666
that we would be
friends if we met today?

38:19.145 --> 38:21.588
Seriously? How many
bullets do you have left?

38:21.593 --> 38:24.797
Would we be friends
if we met today?

38:25.992 --> 38:28.726
- 'Cause this, I mean...
- LISA: Come on, Mary Jane.

38:29.232 --> 38:31.138
We haven't been true friends

38:31.490 --> 38:32.896
in years.

38:33.734 --> 38:36.003
This is like an obligation.

38:36.007 --> 38:37.310
What did you overhear?

38:37.928 --> 38:39.777
Because I wanna address it.

38:39.778 --> 38:42.224
I'm ready to tell you all about it.

38:47.011 --> 38:48.164
Do...

38:50.799 --> 38:53.276
As much as I wanna
punch you in your...

38:53.916 --> 38:55.849
stupid face...

39:00.813 --> 39:01.929
I love you, Lisa.

39:03.363 --> 39:06.319
I really do. And there's nothing
that will change that.

39:06.683 --> 39:08.150
But you've betrayed me.

39:09.478 --> 39:10.756
You... you get that?

39:11.924 --> 39:13.844
You betrayed me.

39:15.976 --> 39:18.052
And I'm gonna
need a little time.

39:18.770 --> 39:21.020
I'm not sure how much time, but, uh,

39:21.488 --> 39:23.526
time, Lisa.

39:24.309 --> 39:27.602
I believe I've earned the luxury
of thinking about me for once.

39:28.835 --> 39:30.106
So...

39:30.107 --> 39:31.725
can I get...

39:31.929 --> 39:33.324
a little...

39:33.827 --> 39:36.685
space to deal with the fact

39:36.687 --> 39:39.877
that I have been betrayed
and that I almost died?

39:41.103 --> 39:42.499
I am so sorry.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.454
I'm actually grateful for this...

39:45.696 --> 39:46.835
...revelation.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.041
Because for once I..

39:52.559 --> 39:54.355
I have felt more free

39:54.676 --> 39:57.135
than I have ever felt in my life.

39:57.648 --> 39:59.148
So I really hope that you...

40:01.062 --> 40:02.399
find what you need.

40:02.807 --> 40:04.755
But I promised you, Lisa,

40:06.323 --> 40:08.741
it is not here at my house.

40:13.662 --> 40:14.836
I love you.

40:15.931 --> 40:17.329
Okay.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.500
