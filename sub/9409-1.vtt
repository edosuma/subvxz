You really are stuck, aren't you?

31:48.880 --> 31:51.840
Oh! Be very gentle. 
 it really hurts.

31:51.840 --> 31:56.760
Maybe we can cut it off 
 with scissors or a knife.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.400
No, no, no, no, no.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.280
- That's too dangerous. 
 - I don't care, Sabrina.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.080
I'm freaking out here!

32:03.080 --> 32:07.200
One more try, then we'll ask 
 my mom to help cut it off.

32:07.200 --> 32:07.950
OK.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.840
There must be a place 
 I can reach down and--

32:13.840 --> 32:16.520
Ow! Ow! Ooh ooh ooh!

32:19.560 --> 32:23.200
- Oh. 
 - Oh, what's the matter?

32:23.200 --> 32:25.440
There's no bottom to this mask,

32:25.440 --> 32:27.840
no line between 
 the mask and your skin,

32:27.840 --> 32:31.920
- no place to reach in. 
 - That's crazy! That's just crazy!

32:38.880 --> 32:40.400
Oh, no, Sabrina.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.840
There's no line. 
 There's no line here.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.880
I'm going to tell my mom.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.880
Those eyes-- 
 those eyes in the mirror.

32:47.880 --> 32:51.360
- What about them? 
 - They're not my eyes, Sabrina.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.360
My eyes don't look like that.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.560
Try to calm down.

32:54.560 --> 32:57.080
Those aren't my eyes! 
 Where are my eyes?

32:57.080 --> 33:00.080
- Where am I? 
 - You're scaring me.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.240
This isn't me in here!

33:03.800 --> 33:05.880
Carly Beth!

33:08.000 --> 33:10.200
Carly Beth, come back!

33:10.200 --> 33:12.080
It's a ghost!

33:15.560 --> 33:18.200
What are you supposed to be?

33:18.200 --> 33:21.280
I'm supposed to be me, 
 but I'm not.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.080
I'm supposed to be me, 
 but I'm not!

33:25.240 --> 33:27.080
Come back.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.720
Please come back!

33:28.720 --> 33:31.600
Come back. Ooh.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.070
Oh.

33:45.320 --> 33:48.200
It's all a bad dream, isn't it?

33:48.200 --> 33:51.960
It's all a bad dream. 
 I'm going to weak up.

34:02.080 --> 34:05.560
- I was expecting you. 
 - I can't get it off me.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.719
- I know. 
 - Please take it off me.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.239
I want it off right now.

34:11.239 --> 34:14.679
I cannot do that. 
 I cannot remove the mask.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.040
What do you mean?

34:16.040 --> 34:17.880
Don't walk away. 
 Answer me!

34:17.880 --> 34:21.920
- I cannot remove that mask. 
 - But why not?

34:21.920 --> 34:24.280
Because it is not a mask.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.560
It is a real face!

34:27.800 --> 34:30.760
I don't understand. 
 Uh...

34:30.760 --> 34:33.360
how can they be real?

34:33.360 --> 34:36.120
They weren't ugly in the beginning.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.560
They were beautiful...

34:40.920 --> 34:44.600
as beautiful as any face could be.

34:47.400 --> 34:51.360
But something went wrong. 
 They changed.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.040
They became hideous...

34:55.360 --> 35:00.840
One after another, no matter 
 what I did to stop the decay.

35:00.840 --> 35:04.920
No matter what I did, 
 deformities set in...

35:04.920 --> 35:07.200
ugliness.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.480
Monstrosity.

35:10.480 --> 35:14.320
I don't believe any of this!

35:14.320 --> 35:19.320
I called them... 
 the unloved ones...

35:19.320 --> 35:22.480
because no one will 
 ever love them now.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.240
No one.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.840
Only you... Carly Beth.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.880
You're the only one 
 who ever wanted them,

35:32.880 --> 35:36.160
the only one who ever loved them.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.600
No! No!

35:37.600 --> 35:40.280
I want it off! 
 I want it off now!

35:40.280 --> 35:41.800
Take it off me!

35:41.800 --> 35:44.720
I hate this face! 
 I hate this face!

35:44.720 --> 35:48.920
Carly Beth... I'm sorry...

35:48.920 --> 35:52.000
but this face is your face now.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.440
No. No! Aah!

35:55.880 --> 35:57.880
[ Sobbing ]

36:05.960 --> 36:08.600
There may be one possibility.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.640
How many times have you 
 taken off that mask?

36:13.640 --> 36:16.480
Taken off? Once.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.680
- There still might be a chance. 
 - What?

36:21.680 --> 36:24.640
W-well, tell me! 
 We have to take it off!

36:24.640 --> 36:28.840
I cannot take it off. 
 Only you can.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.000
With a symbol of love.

36:34.400 --> 36:38.400
What does that mean? 
 I don't understand what that mean.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.160
Who are you anyway? 
 How do you know all this stuff?

36:42.160 --> 36:47.360
I was the man who created 
 these faces, Carly Beth.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.040
You made them?

36:49.840 --> 36:53.120
- But why? 
 - I was like you.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.800
I did not love myself.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.280
I made these faces 
 to hide behind them.

36:59.280 --> 37:04.840
To hide my thoughts, 
 but the thoughts were inside me.

37:04.840 --> 37:09.920
That's what infected the faces. 
 Turned them into monsters.

37:11.320 --> 37:15.120
Like this one is turning now.

37:18.360 --> 37:23.760
Very soon, it will join the others. 
 Failures on the shelf!

37:25.160 --> 37:29.120
I don't dare show you 
 what's underneath.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.160
Or perhaps I should.

37:34.320 --> 37:38.000
So that you will 
 appreciate who you are

37:38.000 --> 37:39.600
and what you've always had!

37:39.600 --> 37:43.040
No! I want my face back! 
 I want myself back!

37:43.040 --> 37:45.640
Oh, shh! Shh! Quiet. Quiet!

37:46.200 --> 37:48.000
You'll awaken them.

37:48.800 --> 37:53.080
[ Carly ] What's happening? 
 What are they doing?

37:55.320 --> 37:58.120
- [ Roar ] 
 - Run! Run!

38:07.800 --> 38:09.840
Oh, no!

38:10.840 --> 38:16.120

 Come with us, Carly Beth.

 Stay with us, Carly Beth.

Come back, Carly Beth. 
 Stay, Carly Beth.

38:42.400 --> 38:45.800
Please, Carly Beth. 
 Join us.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
- Where are you? 
 - Stay!

38:58.000 --> 38:59.480
Never!

38:59.480 --> 39:01.800
Carly Beth... please join--

39:01.800 --> 39:04.440
love us, Carly Beth.

39:04.440 --> 39:05.920
No, I won't!

39:07.280 --> 39:09.960
Love us, Carly Beth. 
 Stay with us.

39:09.960 --> 39:14.440
- Stay away! 
 - Join us, Carly Beth.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.840
- You are one of us. 
 - Stay away from me.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.160
Stay away!

39:20.160 --> 39:23.840
- Join us. 
 - No.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.840
No! No!

39:25.840 --> 39:28.320
Join us. 
 Don't go, Carly Beth.

39:28.320 --> 39:31.840
You're one of us. 
 Don't go, Carly Beth.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.840
Please join us. Don't go.

39:34.840 --> 39:39.000
This is Carly Beth! 
 I am Carly Beth!

39:39.000 --> 39:41.960
This is me! Go away!

39:41.960 --> 39:43.960
Get away!

40:07.320 --> 40:09.240
You're just a mask.

40:10.120 --> 40:12.440
You're just a mask again.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.880
The symbol of love.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.920
That's what he meant.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.520
A symbol of love.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.000
- Hi, Noah. 
 - [ Crash ]

41:09.000 --> 41:11.400
Carly Beth, 
 please take that mask off!

41:11.400 --> 41:15.320
Please, Carly Beth! 
 Please take that mask off!

41:19.560 --> 41:21.960
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha!

41:21.960 --> 41:23.400
Mom!

41:23.400 --> 41:26.880
There you are. 
 Do you realize what time it is?

41:26.880 --> 41:29.800
I love you, Mom. 
 I really do.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.240
What is it? 
 What happened?

41:32.240 --> 41:35.280
I'm sorry, Mom. 
 I didn't mean to scare you.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.520
I've had a long, weird night.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.080
Everything's OK, now.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.320
Well, why didn't you 
 wear your duck costume?

41:42.320 --> 41:43.840
Why weren't you with Sabrina?

41:43.840 --> 41:45.840
Sabrina called twice looking for you.

41:45.840 --> 41:50.480
Well, let's just say I've learned 
 a lot about myself tonight, Mom.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.230
Oh.

41:54.040 --> 41:58.120
Heh heh heh! 
 Heh heh heh!

42:01.360 --> 42:05.240
Now, Noah, 
 don't put on that mask.

42:05.240 --> 42:07.240
Don't worry. I won't.

42:07.240 --> 42:10.360
- Oh, you two. 
 - Trick or treat!

42:10.360 --> 42:13.760
Heh heh heh! 
 Heh heh heh!

42:16.440 --> 42:19.440
Now that wasn't too scary, 
 was it?

42:19.440 --> 42:20.920
Let's ask my family.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.600
Mom, Dad, what did you think?

42:26.440 --> 42:30.360
I think they liked it. 
 I hope you did, too.

42:30.360 --> 42:33.960
Have a scary day, everyone.
