WEBVTT

00:27.986 --> 00:31.239
If we could integrate the sonar
to mapping satellites…

00:31.322 --> 00:34.701
We can locate all the plastic
in the oceans and clean it up!

00:35.702 --> 00:37.579
Did somebody say "mess?"

00:37.662 --> 00:39.080
No.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.291
I better start over here.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.376
And this floor is dirty.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.961
Dir-tay!

00:45.712 --> 00:47.213


00:47.297 --> 00:49.799
Whoa, these things are filthy!

00:49.883 --> 00:52.093
I'll just give them a quick wash!

00:52.177 --> 00:54.262
Do not take those suits, Johnny!

00:54.345 --> 00:55.346
Johnny, run!

00:55.430 --> 00:57.682
Emergency Johnny-stopping move
number eight!

00:57.766 --> 00:59.684
Ha! A-ha!

00:59.768 --> 01:00.852
Well, that's new.

01:00.935 --> 01:05.815
And the Johnny X suit is for extreme
superhero emergencies only.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.650
But this<i> is</i> an emergency!

01:07.734 --> 01:10.653
There's a hurricane-nado heading for a…

01:10.737 --> 01:12.280
Kitten shelter! And…

01:12.363 --> 01:16.826
No, you want them so you can use
your "power-poot powers" all day.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.036
Remember what happened

01:18.119 --> 01:20.205
the last time you snagged
the Johnny X suit?

01:36.763 --> 01:39.390
We should have quit while we were ahead.

01:42.352 --> 01:46.356
Yeah, that was not a good day,
but from now on, I promise,

01:46.439 --> 01:48.900
no more power-pooting
in the Johnny X suit.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.736
Impossible, Johnny. You're a boy.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.197
And boys love everything "fart."

01:54.280 --> 01:57.200
They're right. We do love fart stuff.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.958
And the only way
you're putting this suit on again…

02:05.041 --> 02:07.627
Is if it's a matter of life and death.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.130
<i> Help me!</i>

02:10.213 --> 02:12.215
<i>Help me, Test family!</i>

02:12.298 --> 02:14.634
<i>It's a matter of life and death!</i>

02:15.677 --> 02:17.053
I'm gonna need the suit.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.429
No!

02:18.513 --> 02:21.224
And what's going on, Eugene?

02:23.268 --> 02:26.146
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>when I Johnny-napped Johnny</i>

02:26.229 --> 02:28.314
<i>and tried to brain-implant fake memories</i>

02:28.398 --> 02:30.441
<i>of us being Best Buds For Life?</i>

02:30.525 --> 02:32.986
-Yes!
-Kinda. It's still foggy.

02:33.069 --> 02:36.865
<i>Well, that's when I met Señor Crabo,</i>

02:36.948 --> 02:40.076
<i>the sweet crab with the missing claw.</i>

02:41.744 --> 02:45.206
You! Señor Crabo! Let's go.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.544
OK, you made friends
with a crab, and…?

02:49.627 --> 02:53.715
<i>And I wanted him to be like Dukey,</i>
<i>so I altered his DNA to be like Dukey,</i>

02:53.798 --> 02:55.925
<i>but it wasn't loyal dog DNA like Dukey,</i>

02:56.009 --> 03:00.138
<i>but crabby sea-bug DNA</i>
<i>that likes to pinch things, and…</i>

03:00.221 --> 03:01.097
<i>Oh, no.</i>

03:01.180 --> 03:03.349
<i>-No!</i>

03:05.059 --> 03:06.060
<i>Pinch.</i>

03:07.437 --> 03:08.479
We gotta help him.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.565
I know we can't stand him,
but we gotta help him.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.901
-I'll get the suits.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.321
We don't need Johnny X
or his gross power-poots

03:16.404 --> 03:17.488
to stop a crab.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.782
Their brains are the size of a pencil tip,

03:19.866 --> 03:23.244
which means we can easily stop him with…

03:23.828 --> 03:25.747
The Lab Boat!

03:25.830 --> 03:28.207
So, what do you think?

03:28.291 --> 03:32.211
It's a floating lab dedicated
to cleaning up our oceans.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.547
I think Johnny X would have
saved Bling-Bling by now,

03:34.631 --> 03:37.050
and that this boat is lame.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.468
Really?

03:38.551 --> 03:40.970
Well, what do you think about it now?

03:45.683 --> 03:46.893
It's growing on me.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.854
<i>The sawfish-pedo will get you</i>
<i>onto the island</i>

03:49.938 --> 03:52.941
<i>and cut a path right to Bling-Bling's lab.</i>

03:57.111 --> 04:00.698
<i>Besides tiny brains,</i>
<i>crabs have terrible hearing.</i>

04:00.782 --> 04:02.951
<i>So sneak quietly into the lab,</i>

04:03.034 --> 04:06.287
<i>wait for Crabo to walk</i>
<i>onto Eugene's DNA Transformer,</i>

04:06.371 --> 04:08.414
<i>and pull this reverse lever.</i>

04:08.498 --> 04:10.917
Hey, look, a flame boost button!

04:11.000 --> 04:14.087
<i>It's only for emergency getaways, Johnny!</i>

04:14.170 --> 04:16.965
And you did promise
your power-pooting days were over.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.466
But it's not a power-poot.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.427
It's more like a fish butt-blast!

04:35.525 --> 04:38.486
I don't know if I'd call that
exactly "sneaky."

04:38.569 --> 04:39.779
Johnny!

04:39.862 --> 04:42.073
You came to rescue me!

04:43.366 --> 04:44.742
Intruders.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.245
-OK, what is going on,

04:47.328 --> 04:48.705
and is that a chocolate fountain?

04:48.788 --> 04:51.624
The crab made us an offer
we couldn't refuse.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.586
Help him overthrow the boss
for this sweet chocolate fountain.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.340
And paid vacations if we replace
his missing claw with…

05:00.466 --> 05:01.592
the X-claw.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.344
Benefits.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.222
You mean, "bribery,"
ya back-stabbing crab,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.099
and help me, Johnny!

05:08.182 --> 05:09.767
It's horrible in here.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.438
You know, cos I put you in here
a bunch of times.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.358
OK. You, let him out of the cage.

05:17.525 --> 05:21.195
You, let them keep the vacations
and fountain.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.824
And you, go back to being a crab
before you hurt someone.

05:25.742 --> 05:26.701
Drones.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.202
I'm sorry, did he say…?

05:32.373 --> 05:33.499
Oof!

05:33.583 --> 05:34.917
What happened?

05:35.001 --> 05:36.002


05:36.085 --> 05:38.129
The crab has drones.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.882
And I'm gonna need the suit.

05:40.965 --> 05:44.719
So you can power-poot, then torch
an entire island full of rare plants

05:44.802 --> 05:48.139
and indigenous species?
Forget it, Johnny.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.933
I told you, I won't poot.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.978
Come on, Johnny,
how hard can it be to stop something

05:54.062 --> 05:55.354
that can't even walk straight?

05:55.438 --> 05:58.900
Or is completely helpless
when it's on its back?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.486
The crab might be smarter than you think.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.947
And he's making
a big silver power claw thing.

06:05.031 --> 06:09.702
Oh, yeah? Bigger than the silver Lab Boat
that also has drones?

06:13.039 --> 06:15.458
And ocean-saving blasters?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.922
OK, those look kinda cool.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.885
<i> Now, use the Inciner-ray</i>
<i>to destroy the claw thing.</i>

06:25.968 --> 06:27.929
<i> And the net launcher</i>
<i>to catch Crabo</i>

06:28.012 --> 06:30.765
<i>and drag him to the DNA Transformer.</i>

06:34.560 --> 06:37.188
OK, time to destroy the…

06:37.563 --> 06:40.191
-Hey, where's the claw thing?

06:40.274 --> 06:43.111
I'm gonna guess he's wearing it.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.783
Yeah? Well, now he's wearing this!

06:52.495 --> 06:54.497
Wow, what else does that claw do?

06:54.580 --> 06:56.958
-This.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.503
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

07:03.089 --> 07:05.758
-This.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.470
Not fun. Not fun at all…

07:13.391 --> 07:14.851
And this.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.275
Wait for it.

07:29.323 --> 07:32.785
Huh… maybe the crab
<i>is</i> smarter than we thought.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.912
I told you he was evil!

07:36.956 --> 07:39.876
-Now… world domination.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.546
Huh. Maybe we didn't think
this thing completely through.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.176
Oh, this is bad.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.266
I told you I needed the suit!

07:55.349 --> 07:58.728
We brought it on the boat
in case of an emergency!

07:58.811 --> 08:00.188
It's in the cabinet marked X,

08:00.271 --> 08:02.815
and this definitely qualifies
as an emergency.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.358
Yes!

08:05.234 --> 08:07.195
Get in the fish, dog!

08:07.278 --> 08:08.821
And hit the flame boost!

08:12.033 --> 08:16.704
Ha! It's like the flame
came out of the fish's…

08:16.787 --> 08:18.414
b-butt.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.501
Destroy them.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.216
The drones are catching up!

08:30.301 --> 08:32.386
Let's hope this works!

08:32.470 --> 08:33.429


08:46.817 --> 08:49.529
Oh, no!

08:52.823 --> 08:54.742
Oh, yes!

08:54.825 --> 08:57.912
Now let's see how they like<i> my</i> lasers!

09:00.456 --> 09:03.459
Yeah! Yay! Right on!

09:03.543 --> 09:08.089
And Johnny X will totally
be able to defeat Señor Crabo,

09:08.172 --> 09:09.882
as long as he doesn't figure out…

09:13.886 --> 09:16.180
…how to use my molecular expander.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.932
World domination.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.647
Oh, he got big.

09:24.730 --> 09:28.442
And his normal claw is strong now!

09:28.526 --> 09:30.361
I cannot be stopped.

09:35.866 --> 09:41.038
Actually, you can,
when I use my Hurricane Hands!

09:46.627 --> 09:48.921
And you land on your back.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.340
And I use my super tail!

09:55.636 --> 09:59.348
And the expander goes in reverse.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.142
Oh, pooh.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.111
They did it!

10:13.738 --> 10:16.032
And you're all free!

10:16.115 --> 10:18.117
Yes! Thank you, Johnny!

10:18.200 --> 10:20.411
And thank you, Dukey!

10:20.494 --> 10:22.204
-And--
-Don't even think about it.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.790
Way to save the day, little brother.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.834
And without a single power-poot.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.170
But…

10:29.253 --> 10:31.422
Crabo's still coming to…

10:31.505 --> 10:34.133
Wait. It… it's hugging me.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.720
I guess all he really wanted
was a new claw.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.430
So you're gonna keep him?

10:39.513 --> 10:41.474
Well, I like his moxie,

10:41.557 --> 10:46.729
and to reward my heroes
for saving me and my island,

10:46.812 --> 10:52.068
how about a chocolate fountain luau
and sunset bonfire?

10:56.030 --> 10:58.949
OK, this is amazing.

10:59.033 --> 11:03.079
But I can't get this bonfire going!

11:05.706 --> 11:08.167
OK, go ahead.
