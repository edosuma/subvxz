CAN WE GO BACK
TO H.Q. NOW?

00:25.410 --> 00:28.250
CHILL, DUCK.
IT'S NOT A TRIP DOWNTOWN

00:28.280 --> 00:30.250
WITHOUT GETTING
A LITTLE TAKEOUT.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.720
FRANKLY, I'M A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE

00:32.750 --> 00:35.450
IN A PLACE WHERE

VARIATIONS I TRY,

05:48.160 --> 05:49.770
THERE'S JUST NOTHING

05:49.800 --> 05:51.600
THAT WOULD ACCOUNT
FOR THIS.

06:02.650 --> 06:05.080

I RAN OUT OF SOIL,

06:05.110 --> 06:07.020
SO I USED HOT FUDGE.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.820
WITH NUTS.

06:12.860 --> 06:14.720
SPEAKING OF NUTS,

06:14.760 --> 06:19.060
THIS ATTACK WAS THE WORK
OF ONE DR. THADDEUS DARE.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.830
THADDEUS DARE?

06:20.860 --> 06:22.930
"NUT" IS
AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

06:22.970 --> 06:25.770
A RECLUSIVE AND RATHER OLD
SCIENTIST

06:25.800 --> 06:28.510
BUT BRILLIANT NONETHELESS,

06:28.540 --> 06:29.570
DARE WAS CONVINCED
THAT ONE DAY HE WOULD FIND

06:32.710 --> 06:36.550
HE WENT CRAZY,
AND HIS ROCK EXPERIMENTS

06:36.580 --> 06:39.050
GREW MORE RECKLESS.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.920
HE WAS FINALLY BANISHED
BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

06:41.950 --> 06:43.520
AND DISAPPEARED.

06:43.550 --> 06:46.060
LET ME GUESS.
A GUY THAT INTO ROCKS

06:46.090 --> 06:48.930
WENT UNDERGROUND, RIGHT?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.790
DEEP UNDERGROUND.

06:50.830 --> 06:54.160
I BELIEVE HE'S PREPARING
TO TAKE HIS REVENGE

06:54.200 --> 06:56.770
ON THE WORLD
THAT REJECTED HIM,

06:56.800 --> 07:01.570
AND HE MAY HAVE JUST FOUND
THE ULTIMATE MEANS.

07:01.610 --> 07:04.640
THE JADE
SERPENT CRYSTAL.

07:04.670 --> 07:08.980
YES. THE CRYSTAL THAT WAS HOUSED
IN THE SCIENCE TOWER,

07:09.010 --> 07:11.880
WHICH SANK UNDERGROUND
TODAY.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.220

ABOUT THIS NUGGET?

SAID TO CONTAIN
UNTOLD ENERGY.

SOMEHOW HARNESSES

07:27.760 --> 07:29.630
THE POWER OF THE CRYSTAL,

07:29.670 --> 07:32.900
THERE IS NO TELLING
WHAT HE MIGHT DO.

07:32.940 --> 07:36.970
YOU MUST FIND DR. DARE
AND STOP HIM.

IS KIND OF SUDDEN,

11:38.310 --> 11:39.750
WHY I CALLED THIS MEETING.

11:39.780 --> 11:40.980
YAHH! THAT'S WHY!

SEE ME MAD.

HEY, I WARNED YOU.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.350
YOU TELL 'EM, SISTER.

12:58.060 --> 13:00.260
HA HA HA!

13:02.630 --> 13:04.430
UH-OH.

HUH?

13:25.420 --> 13:29.130
YO, WHAT'S UP, ROCK?

13:29.160 --> 13:31.930
DROP THE DEVIL
AND BACK AWAY.

HEY YA, SLAM.
ARE YOU OK?

14:28.480 --> 14:30.250
HO HO! I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT WHOLE

14:41.100 --> 14:45.270
WOW. I EVEN IMPRESS
MYSELF. HA HA!

14:45.300 --> 14:48.370
I GOTTA REMEMBER
HOW TO DO THAT. [GASPS]

14:51.540 --> 14:54.210
YO, TECH,
WHAT DO YA GOT?

14:54.240 --> 14:56.010
MY SCANNERS ARE PICKING UP

14:56.050 --> 14:58.380
A STRANGE ENERGY FIELD
AROUND THEM.

14:58.410 --> 15:00.980
THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY
THEY'RE BEING CONTROLLED

15:01.020 --> 15:03.250
BY THE POWERS
OF THE JADE SERPENT CRYSTAL.

15:03.290 --> 15:05.450
THE HOT ISSUE ISN'T
HOW THEY'RE WORKING,

15:05.490 --> 15:08.320
IT'S HOW WE'RE
GONNA BEAT 'EM.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.990
WE'VE GOTTA LEVEL
THE PLAYING FIELD.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.660
TECH, CAN YOU
JUMPSTART THAT THING?

15:17.730 --> 15:21.700
THIS MIGHT WORK...

15:21.740 --> 15:24.310
IF I CAN JUST REROUTE
THE POWER RESERVES

15:24.340 --> 15:26.010
TO THE FRONT THRUSTERS.

15:36.350 --> 15:38.990
COME ON!

TO BE A HERO.

16:17.830 --> 16:19.660
ALL RIGHT! ROCK ON!

16:28.070 --> 16:30.810
SO, WHAT WERE
THOSE THINGS?

16:30.840 --> 16:32.710
REMINDS ME

16:32.740 --> 16:34.410
OF SOME OF THE GUYS
WHO KEEP CALLING YOU,

16:34.440 --> 16:37.050
EXCEPT THE ROCKS
HAVE MORE PERSONALITY.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.550
HA HA HA!

16:38.580 --> 16:40.320
YOWW!
[SIZZLING]

16:40.350 --> 16:41.820
WATCH THE FEATHERS.

16:41.850 --> 16:44.620
THOSE ROCK GUYS
ARE THE SECURITY GUARDS,

16:44.650 --> 16:48.560
WHICH MEANS WE MUST BE
CLOSE TO DARE'S LAIR.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.530
Dr. Dare: YOU'RE NOT
CLOSE. YOU'RE HERE.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.760
JUST IN TIME

16:53.800 --> 16:55.500
TO SEE THE POWER
OF THE JADE SERPENT

16:55.530 --> 16:59.240
TURN ACMETROPOLIS
UPSIDE DOWN.

16:59.270 --> 17:02.840
TECH, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

17:02.870 --> 17:05.240
I TOLD YA HE WAS
A CRACKPOT.

17:05.270 --> 17:07.180
LET'S GET GOIN'.

17:13.420 --> 17:16.820
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED
YOUR LITTLE VISIT DOWN HERE,

17:16.850 --> 17:20.860
BECAUSE IT'S NOW
YOUR PERMANENT RESIDENCE.

17:20.890 --> 17:24.460
IN FACT, SOON ALL
OF ACMETROPOLIS

17:24.490 --> 17:26.660
WILL RESIDE UNDERGROUND,

17:26.700 --> 17:31.170
AND I WILL LIVE IN PEACE
ON THE SURFACE.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.370
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, DOC?

17:33.400 --> 17:36.870
THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS IDEA
I'VE EVER HEARD.

17:36.910 --> 17:39.380
YOU WON'T BE LAUGHING

17:39.410 --> 17:42.850
WHEN YOU'RE BURIED
