00:38.083 --> 00:39.125
Stop, police!

00:40.458 --> 00:42.166
Stop that girl!

00:43.125 --> 00:44.541
-Excuse me!

00:46.083 --> 00:47.500
-Terribly sorry.
-Oi!

00:47.583 --> 00:50.083
-Watch where you're sodding going!

00:52.083 --> 00:53.125
Stop her!

01:09.208 --> 01:10.541
Perhaps I should explain.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.958
My name is Enola Holmes.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.666
You may remember me.

01:17.666 --> 01:19.333
After solving my first case…

01:19.875 --> 01:21.583
Hello.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.958
…I started a business.

01:25.125 --> 01:26.833
A detective agency.

01:28.166 --> 01:31.375
Open and ready for my first clients.

01:32.333 --> 01:35.583
I was going to join the pantheon
of great Victorian detectives.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.416
-Detective Field.
-Yes.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.833
-Mackenzie Macintosh.
-Hi.

01:38.916 --> 01:40.625
-Sir Alfred Hornblower.
-Tally-ho!

01:40.708 --> 01:44.166
-And the infamous Reginald Swain.

01:44.250 --> 01:47.541
And best of all,
I would be joining my brother.

01:47.625 --> 01:48.791
I would be his equal.

01:50.625 --> 01:52.666
A detective in my own right,

01:53.791 --> 01:55.666
worthy of the Holmes name.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.458
Congratulations.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.583
-Or so I thought.

02:09.166 --> 02:11.166
Am I addressing the secretary?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.708
You're how old?

02:13.791 --> 02:16.375
-Stone the crows, you're young.
-My age is an advantage.

02:16.458 --> 02:20.208
I can go to places others can't,
explore where others won't.

02:20.291 --> 02:22.375
And I can fight. I know jujitsu.

02:25.791 --> 02:28.125
But you're a girl.

02:28.208 --> 02:30.000
Yes, I am. Um…

02:30.083 --> 02:32.208
What experience have you had?

02:35.208 --> 02:38.000
-The Tewkesbury case?
-Well, that was Sherlock Holmes.

02:38.083 --> 02:39.166
-That was Sherlock--
-Sherlock--

02:39.250 --> 02:43.083
-Sherlock Holmes, wasn't it?
-I assure you, it was mine.

02:43.166 --> 02:46.083
Good man, that Tewkesbury. Brave lad.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.125
-Tell me--

02:47.208 --> 02:49.125
-Tell me--
-Yes?

02:50.083 --> 02:51.375
Might your brother be free?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.833
Read all about it! Read all about it!

02:55.916 --> 02:59.708
Sherlock Holmes
and the case of the Brixton corpse.

02:59.791 --> 03:01.208
So, my brother.

03:01.958 --> 03:05.875
While I had not a single case,
Sherlock has been drowning in them.

03:07.958 --> 03:10.875
Though his latest
appears to be vexing him.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.916
My mother, meanwhile, is still on the run.

03:17.791 --> 03:20.208
And trying not to draw
attention to herself.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.916
Though that's never
been her forte.

03:41.291 --> 03:45.666
Yes, and then there is… him.

03:45.750 --> 03:49.291
My lords,
reform is not a task to be accomplished,

03:49.375 --> 03:50.958
nor a bill that can be passed.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.083
Rather it is a constant need for change.

03:56.583 --> 04:01.250
Lord Tewkesbury,
the champion of change and progress.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.375
A man to approach with the noblest cause.

04:05.166 --> 04:10.458
♪ Till we have built Jerusalem ♪

04:16.916 --> 04:19.041
But I had no time
for distractions.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.416
And besides, he's still a nincompoop.

04:22.541 --> 04:25.833
Too many people
make it their sole purpose in life

04:25.916 --> 04:28.250
to fit into the world around them.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.666
This is a mistake.

04:31.833 --> 04:33.750
It's your path, Enola.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.333
Sometimes, you'll stumble.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.916
Sometimes, you'll fall.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.708
But no matter how lost you feel,

04:42.375 --> 04:44.166
if you stay true to yourself,

04:44.666 --> 04:47.708
the path will always find you again.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.708
But my path, it seemed,
had come to an end.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.208
I was a failure.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.250
All I could do now was go home.

05:25.750 --> 05:26.750
Enola Holmes?

05:27.333 --> 05:28.208
Yes?

05:28.708 --> 05:30.416
I've come to the right place then.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.500
Is it true you find lost people?

05:37.916 --> 05:39.083
Where did you get this?

05:39.750 --> 05:40.708
It's months old.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.583
I found it on the street.

05:44.875 --> 05:45.916
Who have you lost?

05:48.583 --> 05:49.583
My sister.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.458
Watch the gap.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.500
She disappeared a week ago.

06:16.041 --> 06:19.083
Everyone says she's run away,
but Sarah wouldn't do that,

06:19.166 --> 06:20.000
not to me.

06:21.291 --> 06:22.750
She's my only family now.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.041
This way.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.500
The other girls are still at work.

06:36.750 --> 06:37.583
Tea?

06:38.833 --> 06:39.750
Thank you.

06:41.666 --> 06:42.875
Might I see her bedroom?

06:43.500 --> 06:44.625
Ours, you mean?

06:45.875 --> 06:47.291
You're standing in it.

06:50.583 --> 06:53.125
We're lucky.
Most girls here are five to a room.

06:58.875 --> 06:59.791
This might help.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.458
Oh. Sarah likes
to leave cheese out for 'em.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.083
She's soft.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.750
What does she look like, Sarah?

07:14.833 --> 07:16.458
About this tall.

07:17.458 --> 07:18.291
Pretty.

07:18.375 --> 07:19.500
Very pretty.

07:19.583 --> 07:22.541
Green eyes, red hair, freckles--

07:22.625 --> 07:23.875
Red hair?

07:24.583 --> 07:26.666
We weren't sisters in the usual way.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.208
Found sisters.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.000
Sarah took her in.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.291
Who's this, Bess?

07:32.958 --> 07:35.208
-Enola Holmes.
-She's a detective.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.291
She looks like
she'll blow over in the wind.

07:37.375 --> 07:38.250
Mae!

07:41.625 --> 07:45.416
So, Bessie, what was Sarah wearing
the day she disappeared?

07:46.458 --> 07:48.208
-What's she doing?
-Shh.

07:48.791 --> 07:50.083
She's wasting her time.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.250
It was her other dress, the green one.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.458
Does she like reading?

07:57.541 --> 07:59.583
Oh yes. She taught herself.

08:00.208 --> 08:03.375
Sarah said you had to learn about
the world if you're gonna live in it.

08:08.750 --> 08:09.625
Makeup.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.250
Did she have a suitor?

08:12.333 --> 08:15.208
Nah. But there's plenty
have taken an interest.

08:18.375 --> 08:19.916
She weren't much of a gardener.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.958
Look, how about you quit sniffing round?

08:26.041 --> 08:28.250
Quiet, Mae!
Just let her do her job.

08:43.541 --> 08:47.208
The 12th of March.
Does that date mean anything to you?

08:47.291 --> 08:48.291
That's enough.

08:48.791 --> 08:50.833
We don't need help from people like you.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.708
I found her, so she's staying.

08:58.541 --> 09:00.833
-Bloody girls poking their nose in.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.916
-And she didn't leave a note?
-Just this.

09:07.833 --> 09:10.916
She worked two jobs, you see.
We couldn't get by without it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.708
Washed glasses at a pub.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.333
Some place called The Stag Antlers.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.375
You can have it.

09:18.250 --> 09:22.416
Oh. No, it's all right.
We'll figure that out later.

09:23.291 --> 09:25.916
So tell me,
when was the last time you saw her?

09:26.000 --> 09:29.208
A week ago, at the match factory.

09:29.291 --> 09:32.916
She had a fight with Mr. Crouch,
the foreman, in his office.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.208
-What about?
-He said she was thieving.

09:35.708 --> 09:36.916
But Sarah's honest.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.958
The match factory,
is that where she works?

09:40.041 --> 09:43.291
Where we all work.
We're match girls, ain't we?

09:45.000 --> 09:49.416
-Then that's where we'll start.
-So you'll take it? You'll take the case?

09:53.625 --> 09:54.875
Thank you, Miss Holmes.

09:55.416 --> 09:56.250
Thank you.

09:58.041 --> 10:00.333
At last, my first case.

10:00.416 --> 10:01.791
Well, actually, my second.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.208
I shall find you, Sarah Chapman.

10:04.291 --> 10:08.375
Red hair, green dress,
makeup, science books, 12th March.

10:08.458 --> 10:09.833
Whatever you've been up to…

10:12.166 --> 10:13.625
…the game is afoot.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.916
Stay with me. Follow my way.

10:18.750 --> 10:23.083
-How many girls work here?
-Five hundred, maybe six.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.583
How do I look?

10:25.666 --> 10:28.791
-Is my neckerchief all right?
-Oh, well, it's around your neck.

10:29.833 --> 10:30.833
Morning, Bessie.

10:30.916 --> 10:31.833
Morning, Doris.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.458
Mouth.

10:40.666 --> 10:41.500
Mouth.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.250
-Mouth.
-Come on.

10:45.208 --> 10:46.666
-Next.
-Out.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.791
-Please, Mr. Crouch.
-I said, out.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.833
-Mouth.
-What are you looking at?

10:52.541 --> 10:55.166
Oi, new girl.
Name in the register.

11:02.000 --> 11:02.833
Mouth.

11:04.583 --> 11:06.916
-What are you looking for?
-Typhus.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.541
That's the phosphorus.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.666
Don't worry, you get used to the smell.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.458
Is this where she worked?

11:32.458 --> 11:33.875
Put the matches on the comb…

11:36.291 --> 11:37.250
slide 'em along,

11:38.375 --> 11:39.541
up and into the box.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.083
Simple enough.

11:43.125 --> 11:45.416
-You try.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.333
That is a penny off your wages.

12:01.458 --> 12:04.250
She's just learning the way,
Mr. Crouch.

12:04.333 --> 12:07.166
She better learn quicker,
or it's a penny off yours too.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.833
Anyone else want a money dock?

12:10.583 --> 12:11.833
How about you, eh?

12:12.458 --> 12:14.083
No, didn't think so.

12:17.291 --> 12:18.458
Right, back to work.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.041
I need to get up into that office.

12:27.541 --> 12:28.958
Not a hope.

12:42.541 --> 12:43.875
No talking.

12:45.708 --> 12:48.083
All it takes is one small thing

12:48.166 --> 12:50.583
to change the rules of the world.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.291
Oi. Faster fingers, faster fingers.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.875
Hurrah!

13:19.625 --> 13:21.250
How did that bloody happen, eh?

13:22.666 --> 13:23.750
Well, pick 'em up.

13:24.541 --> 13:25.541
Oi, pick 'em up.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.416
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.916
Right! Back to work.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.083
Why were you here?

13:44.125 --> 13:45.333
Come on, girls.

13:47.750 --> 13:48.958
Red.

13:49.041 --> 13:50.333
Time's a-wasting.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.333
Don't you look at me like that, girl.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.958
-Oi, stop talking!

14:15.375 --> 14:18.000
-Green eyes, red hair.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.708
So you did steal something.

14:25.250 --> 14:30.041
Charles! This is not what I was
expecting when we made our arrangement.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.875
This is blatant extortion.

14:31.958 --> 14:32.916
Criminal!

14:33.750 --> 14:36.250
-My pockets are empty.
-You think mine full?

14:36.333 --> 14:39.458
You gave me your word you'd find
whoever was doing this to us.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.541
You sound almost threatening, Mr. Lyon.

14:42.625 --> 14:45.791
This is not what I expected
when we began our arrangement.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.125
And now theft, on top of everything else.

14:49.208 --> 14:52.708
-You heard the man. Get this dealt with.
-Come along, William.

14:56.916 --> 15:00.375
Sir, do you have any suspicions
as to who this perpetrator might be?

15:00.458 --> 15:02.541
Would I be asking you if I did?

15:05.541 --> 15:09.750
But, sir, perhaps if we were to consider
whether this theft is connected.

15:09.833 --> 15:12.416
-I have ideas--
-Did I ask for your advice?

15:13.083 --> 15:15.125
Or did I simply tell you to get it done?

15:15.958 --> 15:18.000
I'll make sure the right people know, sir.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.333
Miss Troy!

15:25.833 --> 15:26.875
Yes, sir.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.500
Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.208
-Are they not, William?
-Yes, Father.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.666
-Please, if you will…

15:37.750 --> 15:41.333
Doris, how are you? How's your sister?
Is she, um, still unwell?

15:41.416 --> 15:43.000
Uh, yes, Mr. Lyon.

15:43.708 --> 15:44.625
Typhus.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.750
Really is the plague of our time.

15:48.625 --> 15:51.333
Two years it's been killing these girls.

15:51.416 --> 15:52.458
Breaks my heart.

15:53.625 --> 15:59.250
Well, Lord McIntyre, if I might suggest
a little lunch. I think we've earned it.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.500
How did Sarah do it?
Get into the office?

16:06.583 --> 16:10.291
There was a fire at one of the stations.
Foreman got distracted.

16:12.708 --> 16:13.583
Whose station?

16:14.375 --> 16:15.250
Mae's?

16:15.750 --> 16:16.791
Yes.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.333
You're a good detective, Enola Holmes.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.791
Everyone thinks detecting
is a profession littered with rules,

16:32.875 --> 16:35.125
but in truth, there's only one.

16:35.208 --> 16:38.916
Pull on every loose thread you find.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.958
She's a loose thread.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.583
So I'm pulling at her.

16:53.458 --> 16:54.958
-Oh.
-Hello, sir.

16:55.750 --> 16:58.833
-What a pleasant evening.
-Young lady, I'm afraid I'm married.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.708
Hello, dearie. Forgot your ticket?

17:21.791 --> 17:25.250
That's tuppence for a sweet,
cheating face like yours.

17:25.833 --> 17:26.916
Ha'penny a piece.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.375
-Genuine toffee.
-Out of my way, girl.

17:30.458 --> 17:31.791
Ha'penny a piece.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.333
Where are you, Mae?

17:35.166 --> 17:36.250
Excuse me, sir.

17:37.666 --> 17:39.958
I've never seen anything like it!

17:44.791 --> 17:47.583
And here she comes!

17:58.500 --> 18:00.875
One, two,
a-one, two, three four.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.916
♪ Where did you get that hat?
Where did you get that tile? ♪

18:08.500 --> 18:11.500

♪ Where'er I go, they shout

18:46.208 --> 18:49.458
And now, all the way from Shanghai,

18:49.541 --> 18:53.416
Mr. Li and his world of illusions!

18:56.166 --> 18:57.500
My next trick…

19:02.833 --> 19:04.916
You the foozler who took my pan stick?

19:05.875 --> 19:09.208
Um, no. I'm looking for a girl called M--

19:09.291 --> 19:10.125
Uh…

19:11.083 --> 19:11.958
Hm.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.875
She worked two jobs, you see.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.875
Some place called The Stag Antlers.

19:29.125 --> 19:32.583
♪ Where'er I go, they shout
"Hello, where did you get that hat?" ♪

19:39.000 --> 19:41.083
You got five seconds
to tell me why you're here.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.666
Did Sarah work here?

19:44.708 --> 19:47.250
She did, didn't she?
And Bessie doesn't know.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.708
There's plenty Bessie don't know.
And plenty you don't need to tell her.

19:50.791 --> 19:54.625
I know you helped her into that office.
She took those pages. Why?

19:55.750 --> 19:58.416
-What's happened to her?
-Just leave us be, all right?

19:59.041 --> 20:01.083
Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.916
Posh or not,
one thing I am good at is fighting.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.458
Now tell me, where is she hiding
and what does she know?

20:10.333 --> 20:11.875
You got more to you than I thought.

20:12.500 --> 20:17.583
Whatever this is,
Mae is on stage in 30 ticks,

20:17.666 --> 20:19.416
and she's still dressed as a gent.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.708
So let go of her, now.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.041
-Get her out of here.
-Be my pleasure.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.708
Come on.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.916
Where did Sarah Chapman do her makeup?

20:41.125 --> 20:44.000
Full of secrets that one,
and not a bad actress.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.291
I'd have given her the boot
if she weren't so good,

20:46.375 --> 20:48.625
but she did attract the men
with big pockets.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.250
Always useful that. Shift it.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.041
Which men?

20:57.541 --> 21:01.083
There was this one gent, society type,
and he came regular.

21:01.166 --> 21:06.500
Very keen on him she was.
He'd send flowers, letters.

21:12.083 --> 21:12.916
His name?

21:16.333 --> 21:17.583
Never gave one.

21:18.583 --> 21:22.541
You see, they all think there's
hope. That love is coming their way.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.000
But it never is.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.250
Blokes like that, they want cheap,

21:27.750 --> 21:29.375
but they marry dear.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.500
"As we two ate of the fruit of love…"

21:35.583 --> 21:38.083
The fruit of love? Ugh.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.666
"A bell did ring in the sky above"

21:40.750 --> 21:43.750
"So wander that place
With its blossoms white"

21:43.833 --> 21:45.833
"A chapel awaits us out of sight"

21:47.791 --> 21:48.791
And a poppy.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.458
Is that his name?

21:52.541 --> 21:53.958
Why did she leave?

21:59.125 --> 22:00.833
Did she run away with this fellow?

22:04.125 --> 22:05.875
Or is she running from him?

22:07.625 --> 22:10.916
I hope it's the latter.
His poetry is extremely bad.

23:00.958 --> 23:02.541
Be away with you, boy.

23:03.083 --> 23:03.916
All right.

23:08.208 --> 23:10.250
-Sherlock?
-Enola.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.625
What are you doing here? It's not safe.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.333
There are scary people about.

23:16.541 --> 23:19.083
-Yes, let me know when you meet one.

23:19.791 --> 23:22.208
-Brother, are you quite yourself?
-I'm fine.

23:22.291 --> 23:25.833
It was just a disagreement
over a glass of wine

23:26.375 --> 23:27.583
and whose wine it was.

23:27.666 --> 23:28.541
And, uh…

23:30.541 --> 23:33.833
I find after wine, it's very difficult
to make your arms and legs move.

23:33.916 --> 23:34.875
Let's get you home.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.000
I don't usually imbibe,
but I'm on a case, you see.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.708
-It's proven rather tricky.
-Cab.

23:42.791 --> 23:44.208
-Hello.
-Hello.

23:44.708 --> 23:47.166
-Where are we going?
-221 Baker Street.

23:52.875 --> 23:56.416
As it turns out,
my brother is medievally heavy.

23:56.500 --> 24:01.250
It's like carrying a dead horse
on which sits another dead horse.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.916
That's A, and I'm B.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.916
I didn't know you had steps.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.500
One should always have steps
to avoid people stepping on you.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.708
That's a tip.
You should probably write that down.

24:17.791 --> 24:20.541
All right. Lift your right leg.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.166
Mm-hmm.

24:23.875 --> 24:24.708
Now your left.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.833
Better leg, the left.
You should write that down.

24:34.041 --> 24:36.875
Ha! Home. Well done, Sherlock.

24:39.125 --> 24:40.125
I can do it.

24:43.666 --> 24:44.500
See?

24:50.541 --> 24:51.416
Baker Street.

24:58.458 --> 25:02.541
-Oh, but it's such a mess.
-It's perfect. Don't touch anything.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.458
What are you investigating?

25:04.541 --> 25:06.875
None of your business.
I work alone. It's private.

25:07.791 --> 25:09.291
Now shh, I'm thinking.

25:09.791 --> 25:11.875
One should never be interrupted
when thinking.

25:13.041 --> 25:15.125
-Oh. You should--
-Write that down?

25:17.458 --> 25:19.041
-Shh!

25:21.000 --> 25:22.166
Don't go in there.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.333
No.

25:38.375 --> 25:40.000
Sherlock's latest case.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.458
Fascinating.

25:52.291 --> 25:56.000
And why, pray, have you moved everything?

26:00.541 --> 26:03.833
-Nothing looks different to me.
-Nothing looks different? Ev--

26:05.000 --> 26:07.125
Your head is sore? I can't think why.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.916
This is why
I don't have people in my rooms.

26:10.708 --> 26:14.250
Look what you've done.
My papers are entirely out of order.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.583
Your case, it's vexing you.

26:18.541 --> 26:21.708
Seems to be an awful lot of question marks
on that map of yours.

26:21.791 --> 26:23.708
Dundee cake. Door.

26:23.791 --> 26:26.125
-I will see you again.
-Is that why you're drinking?

26:26.208 --> 26:29.041
I'm more than certain…
…it's not so old.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.416
-Maybe I can help.
-You can help by leaving.

26:32.791 --> 26:35.958
Huh. Yes. The world
will be a much safer place

26:36.041 --> 26:39.208
if we don't see the inside
of Sherlock Holmes, only the out.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.083
Crazy idea.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.208
Have you ever considered a flatmate?

26:45.291 --> 26:48.041
-For what purpose?
-To stop you descending into this.

26:52.375 --> 26:53.250
Strange

26:54.083 --> 26:58.250
how those seeking advice
so often like to dispense it.

26:58.333 --> 27:01.041
Did I ask for advice?
I found you on the street, drunk.

27:01.125 --> 27:04.333
-Now what may I observe about you?
-We're not playing this game.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.916
Shoes a state. Hair's not much better.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
-You and Mycroft are so similar.
-You need to wash your clothes.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.208
-Unwilling to look past--
-You are pale--

27:11.291 --> 27:14.208
-Stop!
-And then there's your fingernails.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.666
-Why are you working in a match factory?
-What?

27:17.750 --> 27:21.416
Last night, they were dirty with green
traces. This morning, they are black.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.041
The phosphorous from the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.

27:24.125 --> 27:27.041
I wasn't in such a state
as to not see that.

27:27.666 --> 27:29.583
-How did you--
-And your neck is red.

27:29.666 --> 27:31.541
Someone has gripped it
or held a knife against…

27:37.500 --> 27:39.083
Are you involved in something dangerous?

27:40.125 --> 27:41.250
You are still my ward.

27:41.333 --> 27:44.041
If you need my help,
my offer remains on the table.

27:45.583 --> 27:48.125
Don't be so desperate
to prove yourself, Enola.

27:49.666 --> 27:54.083
I am not desperate,
and I don't need your or anyone's help.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.625
But this I will have.

28:08.250 --> 28:11.041
How dare he?
How dare he lecture me?

28:11.708 --> 28:13.416
When he can't even solve his own case

28:13.500 --> 28:16.666
and he lives in a bed of flummoxing papers
and bewildering mold.

28:16.750 --> 28:19.375
How dare he claim I'm desperate?
It is not true.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.750
-And this is not fair.
-Enola?

28:26.500 --> 28:27.500
It is you.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.208
And it is you.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.041
How are you?

28:34.250 --> 28:36.333
Are you well? You look…

28:36.416 --> 28:40.708
I'm on a case. Undercover. Forget
I told you that piece of information.

28:40.791 --> 28:44.625
It's the strangest thing. I could have
sworn I've seen you here before.

28:46.166 --> 28:47.125
Is that right?

28:47.208 --> 28:50.250
Well, this is my…
My route through to the Lords.

28:50.916 --> 28:53.458
Is it? How lovely.

28:53.541 --> 28:56.083
Well, I… I breakfast here on occasion.

28:59.458 --> 29:03.750
I mean, yes, it's a lovely place.
I-I know the gardener here.

29:04.625 --> 29:07.000
We've been discussing
what to sow for next year's crop.

29:07.083 --> 29:08.416
Some fine sunflowers.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.375
Uh, Sweet Williams,
for their lovely vivid reds.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.000
I've seen all you're doing.

29:14.166 --> 29:16.625
Oh. Well, it's… It's nothing.

29:16.708 --> 29:18.041
In the society pages.

29:21.791 --> 29:23.625
You are quite the eligible bachelor.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.125
Don't believe all you read.

29:33.208 --> 29:34.250
I wrote to you.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.250
You didn't reply.

29:37.875 --> 29:38.708
Uh…

29:39.666 --> 29:41.583
I… was busy.

29:42.083 --> 29:44.625
Starting my own business.
A perpetual challenge.

29:45.125 --> 29:46.833
Perhaps, not something you'd understand.

29:47.625 --> 29:50.041
-Well, Enola, if you need help--
-I do not.

29:51.583 --> 29:54.583
Should my problem become horticultural,
I shall seek you out.

29:56.166 --> 29:57.000
Right.

29:57.583 --> 30:00.250
Well, you know where to find me

30:02.166 --> 30:03.500
should a plant go missing.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.583
I hope you enjoy your breakfast.

30:09.916 --> 30:10.750
Yeah.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.500
Is he looking back?

30:20.583 --> 30:22.458
Oh. Good, he isn't.

30:24.750 --> 30:26.250
I don't come here every day.

30:27.166 --> 30:28.791
Just on days when I feel a need.

30:29.708 --> 30:33.833
And sometimes he doesn't take this path.
Sometimes he takes the parallel one.

30:36.916 --> 30:41.125
-You know where to find me.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.500
"You know where to find me."

30:48.583 --> 30:50.125
"Out of sight"

30:50.208 --> 30:53.583
"The chapel awaits us
With its blossoms white"

30:54.166 --> 30:55.041
Whitechapel.

30:55.916 --> 30:57.666
"As we two ate of the fruit of love"

30:57.750 --> 30:59.541
"As we two ate…"

31:00.250 --> 31:01.916
"Two ate." Two-eight.

31:02.000 --> 31:02.958
Twenty-eight.

31:03.750 --> 31:06.458
"A bell did ring in the sky above"

31:06.541 --> 31:07.625
Bell?

31:07.708 --> 31:08.875
"So wander that place"

31:10.083 --> 31:12.166
Bell. Place. "Out of sight"

31:14.083 --> 31:17.083
28 Bell Place, Whitechapel!

31:17.166 --> 31:18.333
Shh!

31:18.416 --> 31:20.041
-Oh, sorry.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.708
The game has found its feet again.

31:28.875 --> 31:30.125
I will not lie.

31:30.208 --> 31:33.041
There is a certain satisfaction
that you feel as a detective

31:33.125 --> 31:35.750
when your case comes closer to resolution.

31:35.833 --> 31:36.958
Like sewing a new skirt…

31:39.541 --> 31:42.416
…which I don't do,
or teaching a dog to sit.

31:43.416 --> 31:46.500
You begin to glow with the acknowledgement
of a job well done.

31:46.583 --> 31:48.500
There's a new Holmes in town.

31:48.583 --> 31:51.500
That's right. Sherlock Holmes
has met his match.

31:52.166 --> 31:55.541
My name will be known,
and Bessie will have a sister once again.

31:56.541 --> 31:58.083
And that is a job well…

32:00.791 --> 32:01.625
done.

32:26.208 --> 32:27.291
Sarah?

32:42.958 --> 32:44.541
What happened here?

32:54.958 --> 32:56.333
Mr. Poppy.

33:06.958 --> 33:08.916
-Oh, Mae.

33:11.541 --> 33:13.791
What happened? Who did this to you?

33:13.875 --> 33:17.750
-Was it him, Sarah's man? Mae!

33:18.500 --> 33:19.708
No, no. It's all right.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.500
I'll fetch a doctor for you.

33:23.916 --> 33:25.541
No! No, no, no.

33:26.125 --> 33:26.958
No.

33:27.625 --> 33:28.458
Come back.

34:05.125 --> 34:05.958
Miss Holmes?

34:07.000 --> 34:09.750
-Inspector Lestrade.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.666
-Enola Holmes.
-Lestrade.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.416
-She… She's--
-Dead.

34:14.958 --> 34:15.875
How'd that happen?

34:20.583 --> 34:24.333
Oh, no, no, no. I'm investigating a case.
A disappearance of a girl.

34:24.416 --> 34:27.458
-What, that girl?
-No. No, no, no. H-Her name is Mae.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
She worked at the Paragon Theater,
the matchstick factory.

34:31.083 --> 34:34.458
-She was a dancer. She's friends--

34:48.791 --> 34:50.041
Superintendent Grail.

34:55.541 --> 34:57.958
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.541
I was sent to investigate
a possible disturbance.

35:00.625 --> 35:03.791
Someone heard some screams,
and then I discovered this young lady.

35:03.875 --> 35:04.916
Her name?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.291
Enola Holmes.

35:07.833 --> 35:08.958
Uh, his sister.

35:09.666 --> 35:10.708
A detective too.

35:10.791 --> 35:13.875
Good God, another one.

35:13.958 --> 35:15.916
Shouldn't you be in finishing school?

35:16.708 --> 35:19.500
Investigating the disappearance of a…

35:19.583 --> 35:20.833
-Sarah Chapman.
-Yeah.

35:20.916 --> 35:24.458
Sarah Chapman?
Well, well, how intriguing. So am I.

35:24.541 --> 35:27.625
-She's wanted for theft and blackmail.
-Blackmail?

35:27.708 --> 35:29.375
Yes, detective.

35:31.583 --> 35:33.958
Still warm. No rigor mortis.

35:34.583 --> 35:37.666
-When were the screams heard, inspector?
-Ten past the hour, sir.

35:38.250 --> 35:40.625
When did you arrive, detective?

35:41.166 --> 35:42.333
A-Around the same time.

35:45.625 --> 35:46.875
Even more intriguing.

35:46.958 --> 35:51.333
Uh, no, I was trying to suppress
the blood. I-I was trying to save her.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.666
Or trying to get information out of her.

35:55.375 --> 35:56.875
Give her a search, inspector.

35:56.958 --> 35:59.666
Oh, I couldn't. I can't pat her down, sir.

36:00.208 --> 36:03.625
Come along, Lestrade.
Let's not be coy about this.

36:03.708 --> 36:06.750
-She's a detective. She knows the rules.
-Yes.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.125
Um…

36:11.208 --> 36:12.416
Give me that bag!

36:21.666 --> 36:22.500
What's this?

36:23.750 --> 36:24.750
My evidence.

36:26.291 --> 36:27.208
And that?

36:30.041 --> 36:31.208
It's nothing.

36:31.291 --> 36:32.750
Then why are you hiding it?

36:33.750 --> 36:37.041
Found at a murder scene
with a freshly dead corpse,

36:37.125 --> 36:39.583
harboring evidence isn't gonna look good.

36:39.666 --> 36:41.875
Superintendent Grail, you can't believe--

36:41.958 --> 36:44.333
What can't I believe, missy?

36:44.875 --> 36:47.625
That young ladies
don't have the hands for killing?

36:47.708 --> 36:48.750
Now, give them here.

36:54.125 --> 36:55.541
-Oh!

37:05.916 --> 37:08.125
-Go on!
-After her, all of ya!

37:09.750 --> 37:11.375
Why ever would she ever do that?

37:11.875 --> 37:14.708
-Get out of the way! Move!

37:14.791 --> 37:16.708
-Stop that girl!

37:19.416 --> 37:20.625
You've seen this before.

37:25.041 --> 37:28.416
Ah. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
You remember me, I hope.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.958
We're looking for your sister.
She's caused a bit of trouble.

37:45.458 --> 37:46.416
May I?

37:56.250 --> 37:57.083
Is it, sir?

37:58.708 --> 37:59.875
Is it?

37:59.958 --> 38:02.125
Take it. I have others.

38:02.208 --> 38:03.958
Take it? I can't.

38:04.041 --> 38:05.083
I can.

38:05.166 --> 38:06.000
I can't.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.000
Perhaps I can.

38:15.541 --> 38:17.750
And this, the famous fiddle?

38:19.375 --> 38:21.291
That I do not have two of.

38:22.458 --> 38:25.416
Perhaps you can explain
what you believe Enola has done.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.416
I wish I was at liberty to say, sir.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.083
Do you mind?

38:41.041 --> 38:43.041
Oh, your latest case.

38:43.541 --> 38:45.041
What's it concerning?

38:45.750 --> 38:47.708
Is it another Brixton Strangler?

38:48.458 --> 38:49.375
Or a Periwinkle?

38:50.791 --> 38:52.458
Don't tell me it's a Clerkenwell.

38:52.541 --> 38:54.416
What evidence do they have
against my sister?

38:55.000 --> 38:58.166
Perhaps, uh, you tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine.

39:01.041 --> 39:02.750
Government case, some missing money.

39:04.125 --> 39:04.958
Now you.

39:05.750 --> 39:07.416
Super wants to talk her.

39:08.208 --> 39:10.500
-Why?
-Just following orders, Mr. Holmes.

39:10.583 --> 39:12.166
Or may I call you Sherlock?

39:14.416 --> 39:17.000
Graydon. Graydon Lestrade.

39:17.083 --> 39:20.791
My father thought it distinguished,
and it is rather.

39:25.416 --> 39:28.708
Well, anyway, should you ever
wish to call me that…

39:30.208 --> 39:31.041
Right.

39:34.083 --> 39:34.958
As you were.

39:45.833 --> 39:47.041
Oh dear.

39:49.083 --> 39:50.875
Whoa!

39:51.666 --> 39:54.333
My mistake.
I should have warned you I was opening it.

39:57.416 --> 39:58.250
No.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.916
Dare I ask?

40:11.750 --> 40:12.875
Good afternoon.

40:13.375 --> 40:15.208
May I ask a favor?

40:20.625 --> 40:23.333
Never mind. Tell me everything.

40:24.166 --> 40:25.708
-A government case?
-No.

40:26.916 --> 40:28.916
Is it
another Brixton Strangler?

40:29.833 --> 40:32.125
Or… Or a Periwinkle?

40:32.708 --> 40:34.875
"You tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine."

40:36.041 --> 40:38.500
He's a ninny. I needed to know
what he had on you.

40:43.041 --> 40:46.083
Money. Unaccounted transfers
going in and out of government offices.

40:46.833 --> 40:49.458
My theory is either bribery,
extortion, or blackmail.

40:49.541 --> 40:50.875
And what have you found?

40:52.666 --> 40:54.750
Separate filings
from five different accounts

40:54.833 --> 40:58.041
going via the Treasury
into one private bank.

40:58.125 --> 41:00.791
-So someone is getting rich from this?
-Yes.

41:02.250 --> 41:04.041
-Who?
-No name.

41:04.125 --> 41:05.541
Just a number.

41:05.625 --> 41:08.583
I visited the bank and inquired.
The money disappeared,

41:08.666 --> 41:10.833
arriving at another bank,
and then another,

41:10.916 --> 41:13.083
and another, and another,
and another, and another.

41:13.166 --> 41:16.833
Every one of them hidden
using different account numbers.

41:16.916 --> 41:18.083
Twenty-seven in total.

41:18.166 --> 41:21.583
-Well, what can you deduce from that?
-Three things.

41:22.166 --> 41:25.916
Firstly, the man's a game player,
perhaps a genius in mathematics,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.083
capable of covering his traces
at every turn.

41:28.166 --> 41:30.541
Secondly, the sources are varied.

41:30.625 --> 41:33.958
Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.

41:34.541 --> 41:35.875
All anonymous.

41:35.958 --> 41:39.125
All going into one pocket.

41:40.541 --> 41:41.541
And the third?

41:44.791 --> 41:45.875
He knows I'm onto him.

41:47.416 --> 41:48.250
What? How?

41:48.333 --> 41:51.833
Every time I pull a thread,
it loosens, vanishes,

41:51.916 --> 41:54.625
reappears somewhere else.
He's leading me a merry dance.

41:54.708 --> 41:55.541
It's…

41:57.958 --> 41:58.916
It's infuriating.

42:00.083 --> 42:02.083
So no leads whatsoever?

42:02.666 --> 42:04.416
One. A week before the first transfer,

42:04.500 --> 42:06.166
there was a break-in
at the Treasury office

42:06.250 --> 42:07.708
by a man in a taper crown hat.

42:07.791 --> 42:08.916
A taper crown hat.

42:09.583 --> 42:10.875
-What was taken?
-A document.

42:10.958 --> 42:13.666
They won't talk about it.
Sensitive information presumably.

42:14.166 --> 42:18.000
But how it connects to all of this
has so far eluded me.

42:18.541 --> 42:21.000
Your turn. I hope the blood's not yours.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.500
I'm looking for a girl, Sarah Chapman.

42:24.583 --> 42:27.041
Her sister employed me. Bessie.

42:28.125 --> 42:31.458
She worked at Lyons match factory by day,
and the music hall at night.

42:32.375 --> 42:33.250
She has a lover,

42:34.541 --> 42:36.291
whose flat I visited.

42:37.750 --> 42:39.041
He'd given her this.

42:42.458 --> 42:43.666
28 Bell Place?

42:45.083 --> 42:46.458
Whitechapel, yes.

42:46.541 --> 42:48.791
And there I found her friend,

42:50.083 --> 42:50.916
murdered.

42:55.208 --> 42:57.541
And who killed her? This poppy fellow?

43:01.666 --> 43:03.041
I suspect so.

43:03.125 --> 43:05.791
Perhaps he kidnapped Sarah
and her friend discovered it.

43:06.291 --> 43:08.041
Love.

43:09.041 --> 43:10.250
What it does to people.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.333
-How was she killed?
-A kitchen knife.

43:14.416 --> 43:15.875
-Did you touch this weapon?
-No.

43:17.750 --> 43:18.833
Then why did you run?

43:18.916 --> 43:20.500
I found more evidence on her.

43:20.583 --> 43:22.416
This policeman wanted it.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.333
-He has this walk.
-Grail.

43:26.125 --> 43:27.250
We have a history.

43:28.875 --> 43:30.375
This was in her pocket.

43:51.041 --> 43:52.250
It's as bad as the poem.

43:54.041 --> 43:55.625
-Leave it with me.
-No.

43:56.125 --> 43:58.333
It's mine, and it's important.

43:59.666 --> 44:03.041
Grail said she had stolen something
and that she was blackmailing them.

44:03.666 --> 44:06.916
-Though Sarah wouldn't do that.
-You don't know this person.

44:08.083 --> 44:08.916
I feel I do.

44:09.916 --> 44:11.958
You came here running from the police.

44:12.041 --> 44:13.791
Someone is already dead,

44:13.875 --> 44:16.125
and you are now a suspect
in a murder case.

44:16.208 --> 44:18.166
You've let your emotions
get the better of you.

44:18.250 --> 44:21.583
Stay here. Don't leave.
I will look into this.

44:21.666 --> 44:25.541
But Sarah Chapman is my responsibility.
No one else cares for these girls.

44:26.125 --> 44:27.666
I promised her sister.

44:27.750 --> 44:29.541
The first mistake a detective makes

44:29.625 --> 44:33.250
is to make it about themselves
and not the case.

44:40.291 --> 44:43.416
Enola, I know you're not a fan
of unnecessary advice,

44:43.500 --> 44:44.875
but please…

44:48.083 --> 44:49.125
…don't turn into me.

44:53.875 --> 44:55.583
I should probably write that down.

44:56.916 --> 44:59.750
Matches, matches!
Come buy your matches!

44:59.833 --> 45:01.083
Only a penny a box.

45:02.750 --> 45:05.375
Matches, matches! Only a penny a box.

45:05.458 --> 45:06.916
Come buy your matches!

45:07.000 --> 45:09.041
Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.

45:09.125 --> 45:11.125
We don't need help from people like you.

45:13.208 --> 45:17.791
See, they all think there's hope.
That love is coming their way.

45:17.875 --> 45:19.125
But it never is.

45:20.291 --> 45:22.375
Gents like that, they want cheap,

45:22.458 --> 45:23.958
but they marry dear.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.583
So, Poppy, you're a gent, are you?

45:30.166 --> 45:33.333
And a well-heeled one
to afford a love nest like that.

45:35.750 --> 45:37.500
-Sir--
-Don't be ridiculous.

46:23.333 --> 46:26.291
There was a break-in
at the Treasury office

46:26.375 --> 46:27.875
by a man in a taper crown hat.

46:33.166 --> 46:36.625
Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.750
"Match makers ball."

46:44.583 --> 46:48.625
"Hosted by Henry and Hilda Lyon.
12 Marchmont Square."

46:50.250 --> 46:51.958
Does that date mean anything to you?

46:54.250 --> 46:55.583
It's not a date at all.

46:57.958 --> 47:01.166
"Their eldest son, William Lyon,
will be leading the first…"

47:02.125 --> 47:04.541
Sweet Williams,
for their wonderfully vivid reds.

47:05.125 --> 47:08.375
Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.

47:08.458 --> 47:10.250
-Are they not, William?
-Yes, Father.

47:10.333 --> 47:13.833
And all along, I thought you were a poppy.

47:16.541 --> 47:19.666
Let's see how sweet you are,
Sweet William.

47:22.916 --> 47:23.916
I'm going to a ball.

47:26.958 --> 47:27.833
Ugh.

47:49.291 --> 47:50.125
'Tis I.

47:51.958 --> 47:53.250
'Tis not I.

47:54.083 --> 47:56.833
Which, when you're wanted
by the police, is most useful.

47:57.458 --> 48:00.875
Pray silence
for his Lordship Viscount McIntyre.

48:00.958 --> 48:03.541
I-I'm sorry to break apart
this glorious occasion,

48:03.625 --> 48:05.250
but, well, I'm a politician.

48:05.333 --> 48:08.291
Any chance to stand on a stage,
I'll always take it.

48:09.458 --> 48:12.916
And I must speak
to thank our host

48:13.000 --> 48:14.958
and applaud his achievements.

48:17.166 --> 48:18.625
No masks, no matter.

48:18.708 --> 48:22.416
For Henry Lyon
turns all before him into gold.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.583
Ha, nonsense! Pewter at best.

48:25.666 --> 48:28.041
What he has done with matches
is legendary.

48:28.541 --> 48:31.458
In two years, he's turned red into black.

48:31.541 --> 48:32.916
Or should I say,

48:33.875 --> 48:36.208
red into white?

48:36.291 --> 48:38.541
And to have this humble man
turn his attention

48:38.625 --> 48:40.666
to typhoid and the working poor,

48:41.333 --> 48:44.166
raising funds,
diagnosing cases in the community,

48:44.250 --> 48:46.416
I'm overwhelmed. I'm simply overwhelmed.

48:46.916 --> 48:51.041
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Henry Lyon.

48:51.125 --> 48:56.000
And to his fine son, his heir, William.

48:58.458 --> 48:59.541
To the future.

49:00.333 --> 49:04.291
-To the future.
-May it ever be bright.

49:06.208 --> 49:08.041
Right, Henry, light us up.

49:09.625 --> 49:10.458
Gladly.

49:15.291 --> 49:17.250
Now go and enjoy yourselves.

49:23.833 --> 49:25.916
I believe I've seen that dress
somewhere before.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.083
-Oh yes, last year.

49:30.416 --> 49:32.333
I think it's charming, elegant.

49:32.958 --> 49:34.208
I think you are kind.

49:48.583 --> 49:49.666
Gentlemen.

49:50.541 --> 49:51.375
Ma'am.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.083
Good evening.

49:56.250 --> 49:58.750
This is a wonderful occasion, is it not?

50:02.125 --> 50:07.041
I mean, the guests are just… delightful.

50:08.250 --> 50:11.791
And the orchestra is most tuneful.

50:16.083 --> 50:18.125
I was wondering if

50:19.291 --> 50:21.666
I might be able to speak to you, Mr. Lyon.

50:24.583 --> 50:27.500
-Uh, have I said something wrong?
-Where is your chaperone?

50:28.291 --> 50:29.291
Chaperone?

50:30.250 --> 50:33.708
My dear, you can hardly expect my son
to talk to you unaccompanied.

50:36.541 --> 50:38.083
-Oh.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.208
I cannot talk to you without a chaperone?

50:47.291 --> 50:48.833
No, of course not.

50:48.916 --> 50:49.875
Honestly?

50:52.208 --> 50:53.083
Honestly?

50:54.083 --> 50:55.375
Who is this woman?

50:55.458 --> 50:57.125
Well, they are talking.

50:57.208 --> 50:58.458
They are dancing.

50:59.166 --> 51:00.875
Good evening, my dear.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Yes.

51:03.083 --> 51:04.375
How foolish of me.

51:06.125 --> 51:06.958
Good evening.

51:23.250 --> 51:25.875
It could be claimed,
with some justification,

51:25.958 --> 51:27.750
that I might have prepared
more thoroughly.

51:27.833 --> 51:30.000
But dancing is not
one of my core strengths.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.291
Well, except…

51:32.375 --> 51:36.125
♪ Knees up Mother Brown
Under the table you must go ♪

51:36.208 --> 51:37.708
♪ Ee-aye, ee-aye, oh! ♪

51:39.208 --> 51:40.750
You see my situation.

51:51.958 --> 51:53.125
Who are you?

51:56.000 --> 51:57.375
The man's a game player.

51:57.458 --> 51:59.500
Separate filings
from five different accounts.

51:59.583 --> 52:02.708
Capable of covering his traces
at every turn. One private bank.

52:02.791 --> 52:06.166
Vanishes and reappears.
No name. Just a number.

52:13.708 --> 52:15.666
Perhaps
a genius in mathematics.

52:15.750 --> 52:19.083
Leading me a merry dance.

52:19.666 --> 52:20.541
It's a cipher.

52:26.375 --> 52:27.208
The polka.

52:28.708 --> 52:31.291
The promenade. The two-step.

52:32.208 --> 52:33.708
They're all dances.

52:33.791 --> 52:35.416
Dance, dance, dance, dance.

52:35.500 --> 52:36.875
Twenty-seven, turn on…

52:42.375 --> 52:44.416
Yes. The Language of the Dance.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.458
"Twenty-seven dances."

52:47.250 --> 52:48.125
I've got you.

52:48.208 --> 52:51.166
Dance one, then 14. 22.

52:55.916 --> 52:58.625
Terrible, aren't they? These things.

52:59.583 --> 53:01.583
All pompidou and popinjay.

53:02.291 --> 53:03.750
Have we met somewhere before?

53:04.875 --> 53:08.166
I feel I recognize you from somewhere.

53:08.250 --> 53:11.416
I simply have one of those faces.

53:13.875 --> 53:14.708
Mira Troy,

53:15.375 --> 53:17.291
private secretary to Lord McIntyre,

53:18.291 --> 53:19.333
Treasury Minister.

53:20.541 --> 53:21.375
Tabitha.

53:22.708 --> 53:24.250
Tabitha Timothy.

53:27.333 --> 53:29.166
You mustn't let them concern you.

53:29.791 --> 53:31.250
It's just a performance.

53:32.083 --> 53:34.375
Everyone here is playing a part.

53:35.166 --> 53:36.166
Testing each other.

53:38.916 --> 53:39.750
Winning.

53:41.375 --> 53:42.208
Losing.

53:43.541 --> 53:44.750
And it's fun,

53:45.708 --> 53:47.125
once you know the rules.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.500
What are they doing with those fans?

53:58.166 --> 53:59.666
Sending messages.

54:00.166 --> 54:03.416
Saying everything that is forbidden,

54:05.208 --> 54:08.541
or too embarrassing to say aloud.

54:13.458 --> 54:15.041
Thank you for the lesson.

54:16.708 --> 54:18.208
It's a lesson hard learned.

54:20.625 --> 54:24.166
Without power, we women
must rely on our wits for our fortune,

54:24.791 --> 54:27.375
because our chances are short. Here.

54:28.083 --> 54:28.916
Take my fan.

54:30.291 --> 54:31.583
I have no use for it.

54:33.083 --> 54:35.958
And if you wish to speak to William,

54:37.958 --> 54:39.541
you could always try with that.

54:57.166 --> 54:58.583
No, not… No, not you. Oh.

55:01.541 --> 55:02.416
Help.

55:05.083 --> 55:06.458
It would be my delight.

55:10.500 --> 55:12.791
Really, there's no need to be rude.

55:12.875 --> 55:14.291
I-I didn't mean to.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.291
Tewkesbury!

55:31.375 --> 55:33.791
-Your timing's impeccable!
-Enola?

55:33.875 --> 55:36.791
Don't speak to me here, otherwise
you'll be thrown onto the street.

55:41.041 --> 55:44.125
-I need you to teach me to dance.
-Teach you to dance? When?

55:44.208 --> 55:46.250
-Teach me to dance now.
-Wh…

55:46.333 --> 55:48.541
You understand
I've been learning since I was five?

55:48.625 --> 55:51.625
Good. I'd feared
you'd be a terrible teacher.

55:51.708 --> 55:54.375
-What are you doing here?
-I'm looking for a murderer.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.416
Though I shouldn't have told you.
Forget I told you that.

55:57.916 --> 56:01.916
-I'm trying to save a girl's life.
-Through dance?

56:02.000 --> 56:03.250
Please, Tewkesbury.

56:06.458 --> 56:09.083
All right. Hold your back straight.

56:11.083 --> 56:14.125
And I'll place my hand here and here.

56:14.208 --> 56:15.583
Oh. Yes.

56:16.916 --> 56:17.791
Hold your arm out.

56:19.375 --> 56:20.208
Good.

56:20.875 --> 56:22.958
Now, I will lead and you will follow.

56:23.041 --> 56:25.541
-That seems like a mistake.
-Face over my shoulder.

56:27.458 --> 56:30.500
And now, one, two, three.

56:31.041 --> 56:33.166
Two, three. Two, three.

56:33.250 --> 56:36.208
Four, two, three. One, two, three.

56:36.708 --> 56:37.541
Two, three.

56:38.875 --> 56:39.750
Good.

56:46.208 --> 56:48.333
You seem different since last we spoke.

56:49.541 --> 56:51.166
Tell me why you've been
coming to the park.

56:51.250 --> 56:53.291
Why… Why watch me walk to the Lords?

56:54.125 --> 56:55.541
Simply keeping an eye on you,

56:56.041 --> 56:58.083
in case you get yourself
into any more scrapes.

56:58.166 --> 57:00.625
-Getting thrown out of trains.
-Enola--

57:00.708 --> 57:02.875
You cannot be trusted
to take care of yourself.

57:03.583 --> 57:04.458
I'm a man now.

57:04.541 --> 57:06.250
You're a man when I tell you you're a man.

57:06.333 --> 57:09.333
And the scrapes I find myself in
are far less visceral.

57:13.125 --> 57:14.125
Now, come on.

57:16.750 --> 57:18.708
Two, three. Two, three.

57:18.791 --> 57:19.916
Look into my eyes.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.625
The rhythm is always there.

57:23.583 --> 57:25.541
Dancing is a trust, it's a union.

57:25.625 --> 57:27.250
That's why I've always loved it,

57:27.750 --> 57:29.958
even when I was being tutored by my uncle.

57:30.041 --> 57:31.750
That man likes a pork mustard pie.

57:32.625 --> 57:33.541
His breath…

57:34.166 --> 57:35.125
Turn, two.

57:36.791 --> 57:37.833
Turn. Feel it?

57:38.750 --> 57:39.583
I can feel it.

57:48.375 --> 57:49.250
Good.

57:50.416 --> 57:52.583
-You dance well.
-Perhaps I have a fine teacher.

57:53.500 --> 57:56.875
Though his breath has less mustard
on it than I'd hoped.

58:18.291 --> 58:21.041
-We have an urgent situation.

58:21.125 --> 58:21.958
I should go.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.083
You'll need a dance card.

58:25.416 --> 58:26.875
But I don't know enough.

58:30.041 --> 58:31.791
-What does that mean?
-You'll learn.

58:36.458 --> 58:39.416
Don't touch the ginger cake.
Plays hopscotch with your bowels.

58:51.791 --> 58:52.625
Oh.

58:53.666 --> 58:54.583
Hello.

58:59.833 --> 59:02.416
-Mr. Lyon.
-Yes.

59:02.500 --> 59:05.000
I was wondering
if we might have a dance this evening.

59:05.750 --> 59:07.166
My dance card is full.

59:07.250 --> 59:08.291
May I see it?

59:16.333 --> 59:18.000
Your last waltz is still free.

59:18.666 --> 59:19.791
How fitting.

59:21.875 --> 59:22.875
Would you mind?

59:34.583 --> 59:35.416
Until then.

59:55.166 --> 59:56.083
'Tis he.

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:05.625
You admire Lord Tewkesbury?

1:00:06.291 --> 1:00:07.291
No!

1:00:08.125 --> 1:00:09.583
No.

1:00:10.750 --> 1:00:12.416
We are old friends.

1:00:13.041 --> 1:00:15.708
I hear he's a good man,
and a great reformer.

1:00:16.500 --> 1:00:17.333
Hm.

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:21.041
Well, if you wish to dance with him,
you may have to wait.

1:00:21.125 --> 1:00:22.250
There's quite a queue.

1:00:25.250 --> 1:00:27.125
Yes, I mustn't lose my chance.

1:00:29.625 --> 1:00:31.208
Good evening, Miss…?

1:00:31.291 --> 1:00:32.208
Tabitha.

1:00:33.041 --> 1:00:33.875
Cicely.

1:00:41.625 --> 1:00:43.791
Forgive me for interrupting.
My name is Cicely.

1:00:43.875 --> 1:00:47.208
Um, your friend Tabitha
suggested we might dance.

1:00:48.250 --> 1:00:49.166
Did she?

1:00:56.416 --> 1:01:01.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please
take your partners for the last waltz.

1:01:27.458 --> 1:01:29.916
You know, I swear I know your face.

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:31.333
What must it be?

1:01:31.916 --> 1:01:33.375
We have never met before,

1:01:34.250 --> 1:01:36.208
but I've seen you looking. Why?

1:01:39.958 --> 1:01:42.500
Of course. The Paragon Music Hall.

1:01:43.166 --> 1:01:45.666
I saw you talking
with a young woman there.

1:01:46.333 --> 1:01:47.666
Sarah Chapman.

1:01:49.541 --> 1:01:52.000
Dislocate from me and I will scream.

1:01:52.083 --> 1:01:55.666
The police are onto you, Mr. Lyon.
As it happens, they are onto us both.

1:01:57.875 --> 1:01:59.958
You were not invited here.
What do you want?

1:02:00.041 --> 1:02:03.625
I'm a private detective,
hired by Sarah's sister to find her.

1:02:04.208 --> 1:02:05.500
Bessie hired you?

1:02:05.583 --> 1:02:06.666
You know Bessie?

1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:10.125
Leave me be, please,

1:02:11.041 --> 1:02:12.500
or you will ruin everything.

1:02:13.125 --> 1:02:16.000
-How? What will I ruin?
-They're watching.

1:02:17.166 --> 1:02:21.000
If you must persist with this,
meet me in the library at midnight.

1:02:22.041 --> 1:02:23.333
Say nothing more now.

1:02:24.916 --> 1:02:26.041
Midnight it is.

1:02:55.750 --> 1:02:56.791
"Moriarty."

1:02:59.333 --> 1:03:00.208
Who are you?

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.958
-My word, you do get in awkward places.
-Why are you holding a poker?

1:03:15.041 --> 1:03:17.208
You must leave. I'm waiting for another.

1:03:17.291 --> 1:03:19.416
Another you're scared of
such that you need a weapon?

1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:21.750
You are always here
when I don't want you to be.

1:03:21.833 --> 1:03:23.416
And sometimes here when you do.

1:03:23.958 --> 1:03:26.500
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing that need concern you.

1:03:28.166 --> 1:03:32.166
I like the look of the one you were
dancing with. What's her name, Cicely?

1:03:32.250 --> 1:03:33.958
She would make you an excellent wife.

1:03:34.458 --> 1:03:36.291
Enola, I am concerned only for you.

1:03:36.375 --> 1:03:39.333
Tewkesbury, if you're still here,
you may scare him away.

1:03:39.416 --> 1:03:42.375
-"Scare him"? All of this is over a man?

1:03:43.750 --> 1:03:45.250
Just leave.

1:03:55.875 --> 1:03:56.791
Lord Tewkesbury.

1:04:00.458 --> 1:04:02.416
Enola Holmes, you're under arrest.

1:04:02.500 --> 1:04:04.958
Try to escape,
and we will make this difficult.

1:04:05.041 --> 1:04:08.416
Let's make it quiet and spare
the fine people any embarrassment.

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.625
-Sir, whatever this is about, I'm sure--
-Murder, sir.

1:04:13.458 --> 1:04:14.708
It's about murder.

1:04:17.916 --> 1:04:19.500
Tewkesbury, it's all right.

1:04:20.375 --> 1:04:21.666
Constable, go on.

1:04:23.291 --> 1:04:24.375
Keep them safe.

1:04:25.875 --> 1:04:27.916
-Please.
-Come along.

1:04:31.750 --> 1:04:32.833
Ow.

1:04:35.541 --> 1:04:37.666
-Oh, I say.
-I knew she didn't belong here.

1:04:45.958 --> 1:04:47.875
-Despicable.
-Disgraceful.

1:04:57.791 --> 1:04:59.041
Quite a party.

1:05:00.333 --> 1:05:03.541
You danced with young Master Lyon, I hear.

1:05:04.916 --> 1:05:08.166
May I ask, impertinently, I'm sure,

1:05:08.250 --> 1:05:09.708
did you want to kiss him,

1:05:10.416 --> 1:05:12.541
or find out more about your case,

1:05:13.250 --> 1:05:14.666
this Sarah Chapman?

1:05:19.625 --> 1:05:23.541
Look, if you're trying to protect her,

1:05:24.458 --> 1:05:25.333
know this.

1:05:26.291 --> 1:05:28.750
I will protect her better.

1:05:30.125 --> 1:05:32.000
There's someone wants to talk to her,

1:05:32.750 --> 1:05:34.625
and they're not as kind as me.

1:05:35.250 --> 1:05:36.083
"Someone"?

1:05:39.125 --> 1:05:39.958
Who?

1:05:42.166 --> 1:05:44.750
Why were you following me that night?

1:05:47.916 --> 1:05:50.416
You were following Mae too, weren't you?

1:05:51.416 --> 1:05:52.958
That's why you found the flat.

1:05:57.416 --> 1:05:58.291
Nice shirt.

1:05:59.333 --> 1:06:00.166
Silk?

1:06:01.041 --> 1:06:02.375
On a policeman's salary?

1:06:04.583 --> 1:06:07.541
Who's paying you, Superintendent Grail?

1:06:07.625 --> 1:06:10.000
Who's paying you to kill match girls?

1:06:10.083 --> 1:06:11.916
Where's Sarah Chapman?

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.416
-I don't know.
-She's a thief and a troublemaker.

1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:16.875
You don't want to risk your skin for her.

1:06:19.458 --> 1:06:23.125
Well, if I can't find it out from you,
I'll find it out from someone else,

1:06:23.208 --> 1:06:26.041
like her sister, little Bessie.

1:06:27.250 --> 1:06:28.541
She's just a little girl.

1:06:28.625 --> 1:06:31.291
Oh, but that's how it starts,
Enola Holmes!

1:06:31.375 --> 1:06:35.708
With little girls like her,
and you, and Sarah Chapman,

1:06:35.791 --> 1:06:38.583
asking questions,
doubting those in charge,

1:06:38.666 --> 1:06:40.958
not seeing their protection
for what it is,

1:06:41.041 --> 1:06:42.583
trying to tear it down.

1:06:43.250 --> 1:06:47.041
Well, it only takes one little flame
to start a fire,

1:06:47.125 --> 1:06:50.083
and my job is to keep
crushing those bloody flames out.

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.166
Now, I'll be kind

1:06:55.666 --> 1:06:57.500
and give you one last chance.

1:06:59.833 --> 1:07:00.708
Where is she?

1:07:02.333 --> 1:07:03.208
I don't know.

1:07:10.916 --> 1:07:12.375
Then you're for the noose.

1:07:12.958 --> 1:07:14.458
Some detective you were.

1:07:16.041 --> 1:07:17.791
Should have stuck to needlework.

1:07:31.541 --> 1:07:32.666
Sir?

1:07:32.750 --> 1:07:34.041
-Sir.
-Don't be ridi--

1:07:37.833 --> 1:07:39.166
Superintendent Grail.

1:07:40.666 --> 1:07:42.166
Mr. Holmes.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:45.333
I'm here for my sister.

1:07:45.833 --> 1:07:47.708
If you can arrange her release,

1:07:49.416 --> 1:07:50.583
I'd much appreciate it.

1:07:52.625 --> 1:07:54.041
She is my ward and a minor.

1:07:54.791 --> 1:07:55.791
And a murderer.

1:07:55.875 --> 1:07:58.208
Any evidence you think
you have against her--

1:07:58.291 --> 1:07:59.541
I have plenty.

1:08:00.875 --> 1:08:04.375
She was seen arguing with the victim,
following the victim,

1:08:04.458 --> 1:08:08.166
fighting with the victim, and lastly,
standing over the victim's dead body.

1:08:08.250 --> 1:08:11.041
And when we find her there,
with blood on her hands,

1:08:11.125 --> 1:08:12.541
she bloody runs.

1:08:15.416 --> 1:08:16.583
I saw your murder site.

1:08:20.791 --> 1:08:24.416
Marks on and around the door
show that it was forced open,

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:25.791
and recently.

1:08:25.875 --> 1:08:27.208
There were signs of a scuffle

1:08:27.291 --> 1:08:30.291
and boot marks
from three separate intruders.

1:08:30.375 --> 1:08:31.833
One of them heavyset,

1:08:32.625 --> 1:08:35.416
judging by the height and extent
of the subsequent damage.

1:08:36.416 --> 1:08:38.833
Traces of fabric and spots of blood

1:08:38.916 --> 1:08:42.750
suggests that there was
another occupant, likely female,

1:08:42.833 --> 1:08:44.500
who seems to have fought back,

1:08:44.583 --> 1:08:47.583
using a sharp and improvised weapon…

1:08:50.916 --> 1:08:52.791
before escaping through the window.

1:08:52.875 --> 1:08:55.125
This was a targeted
search and interrogation

1:08:55.208 --> 1:08:57.291
in which two women were discovered,

1:08:57.375 --> 1:08:59.416
and then my sister arrived,

1:09:00.375 --> 1:09:03.041
and you were curiously fast
to arrive after her.

1:09:03.625 --> 1:09:06.250
Now, are you going to release her,
or shall I?

1:09:09.333 --> 1:09:12.416
-Sergeant Beeston, if you please.
-Sir.

1:09:13.875 --> 1:09:15.375
Fingerprint matching.

1:09:15.458 --> 1:09:17.375
New invention, Swiss.

1:09:17.458 --> 1:09:20.166
-You have heard of it?
-I have.

1:09:20.250 --> 1:09:22.041
Would you care to look?

1:09:24.791 --> 1:09:27.083
Makes our work so much more efficient,

1:09:28.125 --> 1:09:29.916
especially in a murder case.

1:09:36.333 --> 1:09:38.166
My sister never touched that weapon.

1:09:39.500 --> 1:09:41.125
Then why are her prints on it?

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:49.750
It's a great age we live in,
isn't it, Mr. Holmes?

1:10:13.041 --> 1:10:15.250
Have you any sense
what time it is?

1:10:16.333 --> 1:10:19.583
-Hello, Edith.
-You're lucky, I almost broke your legs.

1:10:20.375 --> 1:10:22.083
Then I recognized the shoulders.

1:10:22.708 --> 1:10:25.916
-You have very recognizable shoulders.
-Enola's been arrested.

1:10:27.416 --> 1:10:28.458
For why?

1:10:29.291 --> 1:10:30.208
Murder.

1:10:32.875 --> 1:10:34.833
What she's got tangled with,

1:10:35.416 --> 1:10:37.333
it may go wider than I thought.

1:10:39.666 --> 1:10:41.791
And there's something
about this case that…

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:45.750
Deduction alone will not solve?

1:10:47.875 --> 1:10:50.000
I may need your…

1:10:53.500 --> 1:10:54.375
I need your help.

1:10:56.541 --> 1:10:58.291
We need your help.

1:10:58.833 --> 1:11:01.416
Exercise for 15 minutes.

1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:04.083
Well, like my mother always said,

1:11:04.166 --> 1:11:06.500
"Those who can turn to others
when they're in need

1:11:06.583 --> 1:11:08.500
are the truly brave amongst us."

1:11:09.333 --> 1:11:11.458
Your mother sounds very different to mine.

1:11:22.666 --> 1:11:24.125
I did try to stop her,

1:11:24.208 --> 1:11:27.541
but she's full of this fight.

1:11:30.583 --> 1:11:32.166
There we go. Finally.

1:11:32.250 --> 1:11:34.625
You can't control Enola Holmes.

1:11:34.708 --> 1:11:37.041
She's a force of nature,

1:11:37.791 --> 1:11:38.916
a law unto herself.

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.541
Go easy on her, girls.

1:11:43.083 --> 1:11:43.958
Yes, she is.

1:11:46.083 --> 1:11:47.375
And I fear she will hang.

1:12:04.833 --> 1:12:05.666
Hm?

1:12:19.458 --> 1:12:20.458
Come on, girls!

1:12:22.833 --> 1:12:23.666
In there.

1:12:25.458 --> 1:12:26.625
'Tis I.

1:12:28.833 --> 1:12:30.958
-Yah!

1:12:32.541 --> 1:12:33.750
Oh, it is good to see you.

1:12:34.666 --> 1:12:35.875
-Yah!

1:12:35.958 --> 1:12:37.041
Hang on!

1:12:41.166 --> 1:12:42.083
Yah!

1:12:44.583 --> 1:12:46.000
They're onto us!

1:12:47.083 --> 1:12:49.125
-Yah!
-Be ready in there!

1:12:51.125 --> 1:12:53.208
So this case of yours, how's it going?

1:12:53.291 --> 1:12:54.166
I don't know.

1:12:54.250 --> 1:12:57.375
I was trying to help a girl find
her sister, and I've made things worse.

1:12:57.458 --> 1:12:58.416
Nonsense.

1:12:58.500 --> 1:13:01.208
You stirred up a hornet's nest.
You are onto something.

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.333
-Standby!
-Why else would they try and silence you?

1:13:07.291 --> 1:13:09.375
Don't worry, it's completely harmless.

1:13:12.250 --> 1:13:14.000
-On your left!
-My left or yours?

1:13:14.833 --> 1:13:15.916
Yours!

1:13:33.083 --> 1:13:35.500
This match factory,
what do you know about it?

1:13:35.583 --> 1:13:36.958
It's a roaring success.

1:13:37.041 --> 1:13:39.166
In two years, it's doubled its profits.

1:13:39.250 --> 1:13:41.416
-And now there's typhus.
-Typhus?

1:13:41.500 --> 1:13:44.125
Yes, the girls are going down with it.
They're dying.

1:13:45.416 --> 1:13:46.416
That's a loose thread.

1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:48.125
-What?
-They're back!

1:13:48.833 --> 1:13:49.750
Yah!

1:13:50.708 --> 1:13:53.416
Here they come! Brace yourselves!

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:03.208
We know about these factories.

1:14:03.291 --> 1:14:04.750
Come on, come on!

1:14:04.833 --> 1:14:06.958
Girls like Sarah Chapman,
they're expendable.

1:14:07.041 --> 1:14:09.750
They go missing,
too often they die, no one cares.

1:14:09.833 --> 1:14:12.791
But this girl, they care about.
And greatly.

1:14:12.875 --> 1:14:14.291
So, what does she know?

1:14:14.375 --> 1:14:16.375
-Get up here now!

1:14:16.458 --> 1:14:18.458
She stole something. Some papers.

1:14:18.541 --> 1:14:22.708
Aha! So what's she gonna do with them?
What's her plan? She's not a thief.

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:26.291
She's not a blackmailer.
She is a troublemaker.

1:14:26.375 --> 1:14:28.250
She knows something,

1:14:28.333 --> 1:14:30.875
and that is infinitely more dangerous.

1:14:31.375 --> 1:14:32.375
Come on, lads!

1:14:39.291 --> 1:14:41.791
-Stand by to the right!
-Would you mind?

1:14:41.875 --> 1:14:43.500
-Wait for it.
-W-W-Where?

1:14:43.583 --> 1:14:45.333
-Wait for it!
-Straight.

1:14:46.041 --> 1:14:47.000
Now!

1:14:48.208 --> 1:14:50.250
Get it out!
Get it out of here!

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:06.500
Now, whatever Sarah's hiding, Enola,

1:15:07.625 --> 1:15:08.500
it's a secret.

1:15:10.916 --> 1:15:13.666
You need to look
for what she knows, Enola.

1:15:16.208 --> 1:15:18.375
Find that out,
and everything else will follow.

1:15:20.666 --> 1:15:22.083
She's probably under your nose.

1:15:24.250 --> 1:15:26.041
-Huh?
-Get down!

1:15:28.125 --> 1:15:29.041
That's just rude.

1:15:32.041 --> 1:15:33.875
-Grail.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.208
You all right, Edith?

1:15:40.291 --> 1:15:41.583
Just about! Yah!

1:15:48.500 --> 1:15:49.500
Yah!

1:15:56.208 --> 1:15:57.541
Yah!

1:15:59.291 --> 1:16:00.833
Oh, for goodness sake!

1:16:06.625 --> 1:16:07.625
Oh!

1:16:18.958 --> 1:16:19.958
That's not good.

1:16:20.041 --> 1:16:21.583
Get 'em to the bank!

1:16:22.875 --> 1:16:24.583
You all right? You all right?

1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:27.791
-All right?
-I'm all right, yeah.

1:16:28.791 --> 1:16:29.833
Oh no.

1:16:29.916 --> 1:16:30.750
Sir.

1:16:35.416 --> 1:16:36.791
Glory be.

1:16:37.833 --> 1:16:38.958
It's the Holy Trinity.

1:16:41.916 --> 1:16:43.583
I'll make commissioner for this.

1:16:44.916 --> 1:16:45.875
Take 'em.

1:16:47.791 --> 1:16:48.916
Must we?

1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:49.875
I fear so.

Good thing
I never valued my pelvis.

1:18:06.291 --> 1:18:07.541
How about you, Edith?

1:18:07.625 --> 1:18:09.166
-How are the kidneys?
-Fine.

1:18:09.750 --> 1:18:10.916
I quite enjoyed it.

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:14.083
Hm. You enjoy everything.
It's most irritating.

1:18:14.625 --> 1:18:16.750
Come on, this way.
Better get a move on.

1:18:16.833 --> 1:18:17.833
All right.

1:18:19.958 --> 1:18:23.958
So, um, how's that useless boy of yours?

1:18:25.458 --> 1:18:26.875
I hear he's doing good work.

1:18:29.125 --> 1:18:30.583
-He is.
-Uh-huh.

1:18:31.625 --> 1:18:34.708
Well then,
perhaps not so useless after all.

1:18:35.875 --> 1:18:38.541
I wouldn't say he's "my boy."

1:18:42.250 --> 1:18:46.458
You know, I sometimes think
I brought you up to be too independent.

1:18:47.041 --> 1:18:49.208
-Mother!
-I did it with all of you.

1:18:49.291 --> 1:18:53.458
Your purpose must be to find who you are.

1:18:53.541 --> 1:18:56.333
You, Sherlock, Mycroft.

1:18:56.833 --> 1:18:59.458
Strong, formidable, individual children,

1:18:59.541 --> 1:19:03.166
but, well, perhaps a little lonely.

1:19:06.041 --> 1:19:08.166
You will do very well on your own, Enola.

1:19:08.916 --> 1:19:13.250
But with others, you could be magnificent.

1:19:15.875 --> 1:19:19.375
Who do you think
organized all of this after all? Hm?

1:19:19.875 --> 1:19:20.708
Me?

1:19:23.291 --> 1:19:25.791
No, you find your allies.

1:19:26.375 --> 1:19:29.750
Work with them,
and you will become more of who you are.

1:19:31.041 --> 1:19:32.541
You speak with one voice,

1:19:33.083 --> 1:19:36.208
and you will make more noise
than you could ever have imagined.

1:19:38.416 --> 1:19:42.041
Come on. She should go.
We'll put them off her scent.

1:19:43.250 --> 1:19:46.291
So, you dust yourself down…

1:19:49.333 --> 1:19:50.416
…keep facing forward.

1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:55.500
And if you ever get condemned
for murder again, you give me a shout.

1:19:56.666 --> 1:19:57.500
I will.

1:20:02.125 --> 1:20:03.208
Thank you, Edith.

1:20:08.416 --> 1:20:09.250
Be careful.

1:20:25.291 --> 1:20:26.666
And get a haircut.

1:20:26.750 --> 1:20:27.875
It's a mess.

1:20:30.375 --> 1:20:31.750
I think my hair is fine.

1:20:45.083 --> 1:20:46.250
Come on.

1:20:51.208 --> 1:20:52.833
I need you to pack your things.

1:20:52.916 --> 1:20:55.125
I need you to be in a safer place.

1:20:55.208 --> 1:20:57.833
Is… Is my sister gone?

1:20:57.916 --> 1:20:59.500
-Like Mae?
-No.

1:20:59.583 --> 1:21:00.750
-Is she--
-No.

1:21:00.833 --> 1:21:02.333
I'm sure she's all right.

1:21:02.416 --> 1:21:04.333
I'm closer to finding her.

1:21:06.250 --> 1:21:07.083
Doris,

1:21:08.583 --> 1:21:09.666
she'll take me in.

1:21:10.291 --> 1:21:12.000
She's got a spare bed now.

1:21:13.916 --> 1:21:14.750
Her sister?

1:21:16.291 --> 1:21:17.291
Dead.

1:21:17.375 --> 1:21:18.208
Typhus.

1:21:23.333 --> 1:21:24.208
Dead.

1:21:36.291 --> 1:21:38.416
There's traces of something in this soil.

1:21:41.083 --> 1:21:42.958
One has red, and one has white in it.

1:21:46.416 --> 1:21:50.166
The matches you make,
when did they change from red to white?

1:21:50.250 --> 1:21:52.625
I dunno. Around two years ago.

1:21:52.708 --> 1:21:58.541
In two years, he's turned red into black.
Or should I say red into white?

1:21:59.125 --> 1:22:00.916
Typhus.
The plague of our times.

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.583
Two years it's been killing these girls.

1:22:23.541 --> 1:22:24.375
Out.

1:22:25.625 --> 1:22:26.833
What are you looking at?

1:23:00.875 --> 1:23:01.750
I need your help.

1:23:04.416 --> 1:23:06.166
Don't make me repeat it! May I come in?

1:23:08.208 --> 1:23:11.541
Firstly, I would like to apologize
for so much.

1:23:11.625 --> 1:23:14.083
I have failed
to see allies in plain sight.

1:23:14.166 --> 1:23:15.250
-And I have--
-Enola.

1:23:16.250 --> 1:23:17.916
There's something I wish to say too.

1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:19.375
-All right.
-If you'd just--

1:23:25.166 --> 1:23:29.041
All day, every day,
all I do is compromise.

1:23:30.208 --> 1:23:33.416
If I vote for this lord's bill that will
allow him to pump bilge water into a lake,

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:35.583
then he will vote for my forestry reform.

1:23:35.666 --> 1:23:39.083
I want to stand up and say,
"This isn't right," but I have no allies.

1:23:39.875 --> 1:23:42.500
So to do so
would be to risk all that is good,

1:23:42.583 --> 1:23:45.291
so I lie awake trying to work out
which path to follow,

1:23:46.166 --> 1:23:47.000
alone.

1:23:48.833 --> 1:23:50.416
There is no search for a wife,

1:23:51.375 --> 1:23:54.708
because politics consumes me constantly.

1:23:57.625 --> 1:23:59.625
That is the speech I stored up for you.

1:24:02.875 --> 1:24:03.875
You're a good man.

1:24:05.166 --> 1:24:06.083
I'm a man now?

1:24:06.583 --> 1:24:07.750
On occasion.

1:24:08.416 --> 1:24:11.500
But I understand your struggle,
because I struggle too.

1:24:12.291 --> 1:24:14.250
I am sorry we cannot talk more,
because I have--

1:24:14.333 --> 1:24:16.208
A case to solve?

1:24:20.666 --> 1:24:22.916
The girl I'm looking for, Sarah Chapman,

1:24:23.791 --> 1:24:25.541
she has proof that girls are dying

1:24:25.625 --> 1:24:27.958
from the phosphorus
they work with every day.

1:24:28.041 --> 1:24:31.541
And the factory
are trying to cover it up as typhus.

1:24:32.583 --> 1:24:33.541
She knows it,

1:24:34.750 --> 1:24:36.833
and someone is going to kill her for it.

1:24:36.916 --> 1:24:38.000
Then what can we do?

1:24:40.333 --> 1:24:41.166
We?

1:24:47.333 --> 1:24:50.333
-Don't open it. it could be the police.
-You're still wanted by the police?

1:24:50.416 --> 1:24:52.583
-Of course. I escaped jail.
-You escaped?

1:24:52.666 --> 1:24:53.833
Forget I told you that.

1:24:55.416 --> 1:24:58.500
The lights are on. If I don't answer,
they'll suspect more. Hide.

1:24:58.583 --> 1:25:00.250
-Coming.

1:25:02.750 --> 1:25:04.625
-Miss Cicely.
-I'm sorry it's so late.

1:25:04.708 --> 1:25:08.375
No, no, not at all.
I-I told you to come. I-I want to help.

1:25:08.458 --> 1:25:10.625
-Is anyone else here?
-No.

1:25:10.708 --> 1:25:11.958
-Um--
-Good.

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:15.458
Better we are alone, for it is imperative
that I speak with you.

1:25:15.958 --> 1:25:18.541
Sir, I feel that you're a man
of great character

1:25:18.625 --> 1:25:19.750
and that I can trust you.

1:25:20.250 --> 1:25:23.750
Which is why I fear I may have to unburden
myself, and it may prove shocking.

1:25:23.833 --> 1:25:24.916
Miss Cicely--

1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:29.041
It's just, I've been wanting
to speak with you about… a relationship.

1:25:29.125 --> 1:25:32.416
Oh, that. Yes. Uh, perhaps
we can discuss this another time?

1:25:33.458 --> 1:25:34.291
Please, sir.

1:25:34.375 --> 1:25:37.750
I'm terribly sorry. Let me assure you,
I do share your interest.

1:25:37.833 --> 1:25:40.291
-We will talk again.
-Thank you.

1:25:43.291 --> 1:25:45.625
She's gone. She was flustered.

1:25:48.458 --> 1:25:51.291
Do not think of doubting me.
Cicely was here for my help.

1:25:51.875 --> 1:25:55.000
She told me at the ball that she's working
on a bill to change factory law.

1:25:56.333 --> 1:25:58.833
She's unearthed something,
some corruption or other.

1:25:59.458 --> 1:26:00.708
She's doing what?

1:26:05.291 --> 1:26:09.125
Enola, if you have any concerns,
I tell you categorically, I…

1:26:09.208 --> 1:26:10.875
I have no eyes for anyone, but…

1:26:12.541 --> 1:26:14.666
Well, no, this is not
quite how I wanted to say that.

1:26:15.708 --> 1:26:18.583
But to say,
in terms of romantic interests,

1:26:19.083 --> 1:26:21.250
yes, my interest is…

1:26:21.750 --> 1:26:24.458
The reason I don't have to search,
I'm busy with politics, like I said…

1:26:24.541 --> 1:26:25.958
You admire Lord Tewkesbury?

1:26:26.041 --> 1:26:28.666
I hear he is a good man
and a great reformer.

1:26:28.750 --> 1:26:31.125
The woman I would be most interested in--

1:26:31.208 --> 1:26:32.583
I mustn't lose my chance.

1:26:33.916 --> 1:26:34.916
You're not listening.

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.791
Good evening, Lord Tewkesbury.

1:26:36.875 --> 1:26:38.583
She didn't have a chaperone.

1:26:40.833 --> 1:26:43.208
You got five seconds
to tell me why you're here.

1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:45.291
I have been blind!

1:26:45.375 --> 1:26:48.250
The phosphorus in the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.

1:26:49.166 --> 1:26:50.666
I have missed everything.

1:26:50.750 --> 1:26:52.208
She's probably under your nose.

1:26:55.541 --> 1:26:56.875
Cicely.

1:27:05.458 --> 1:27:07.583
Sarah is Cicely.

1:27:09.375 --> 1:27:11.250
Cicely is Sarah!

1:27:11.875 --> 1:27:13.083
-Enola!

1:27:13.708 --> 1:27:15.000
Enola, what on Earth…

1:27:17.458 --> 1:27:19.375
Enola, did you understand what I said?

1:27:20.083 --> 1:27:24.083
Or rather what I didn't say?
Did you understand… what I didn't say?

1:27:24.166 --> 1:27:26.375
Yes. You were saying that you…

1:27:34.833 --> 1:27:35.916
You'll learn.

1:27:37.041 --> 1:27:40.833
That message
you sent me with the fan at the ball,

1:27:40.916 --> 1:27:41.833
what did it mean?

1:27:45.666 --> 1:27:46.708
It means I love you.

1:27:55.083 --> 1:27:58.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
to the future.

1:28:02.750 --> 1:28:03.750
Of course.

1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.333
They were working together, in love.

1:28:09.458 --> 1:28:10.833
They had a plan.

1:28:12.208 --> 1:28:16.583
To expose the corruption in that factory
and stop what his father was doing.

1:28:17.375 --> 1:28:18.625
They wanted your help.

1:28:18.708 --> 1:28:20.833
William Lyon invited you to that ball.

1:28:20.916 --> 1:28:22.458
He's a radical just like you.

1:28:23.125 --> 1:28:25.166
They needed my help. You're right.

1:28:25.958 --> 1:28:27.750
But, Enola, we must return inside.

1:28:27.833 --> 1:28:30.166
The police are pursuing you,
and we have much to talk of.

1:28:30.250 --> 1:28:32.916
No! I know we have much to talk of,
my dear, dear lord.

1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:34.125
You love me.

1:28:34.208 --> 1:28:36.250
And as it turns out, I love you too.

1:28:37.583 --> 1:28:38.583
You love me too?

1:28:41.041 --> 1:28:42.833
You really are a nincompoop.

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:45.833
Now hail a cab.

1:28:57.083 --> 1:29:00.875
-Shh. You're walking loudly.
-But it's gravel.

1:29:00.958 --> 1:29:02.958
-You've got large feet.
-I know.

1:29:08.291 --> 1:29:10.541
Wait here. Keep guard.

1:29:10.625 --> 1:29:12.916
If anyone comes,
just tell them you're a lord.

1:29:13.708 --> 1:29:14.583
I am a lord.

1:29:15.291 --> 1:29:16.916
Then they'll likely believe you.

1:29:17.583 --> 1:29:18.416
All right.

1:30:09.833 --> 1:30:11.041
You.

1:30:13.458 --> 1:30:15.750
-How ridiculous you are.
-I'm ridiculous?

1:30:15.833 --> 1:30:18.000
I told you to stay safe and stay away.

1:30:18.083 --> 1:30:20.791
Now you're breaking out of prison
and have the police after you.

1:30:21.291 --> 1:30:24.125
Oh. Are you hurt? I am sorry.

1:30:24.208 --> 1:30:25.666
Are you not hurt?

1:30:27.208 --> 1:30:28.208
It seems not.

1:30:29.125 --> 1:30:29.958
Hm.

1:30:30.458 --> 1:30:32.583
I wonder who taught you
to fight like that.

1:30:33.333 --> 1:30:35.083
Another thing our mother
has to answer for.

1:30:35.166 --> 1:30:37.583
She should have fed me as well as you
is what I think.

1:30:38.625 --> 1:30:41.458
Hang on. Why are you here?
Is it my case, or your own?

1:30:42.041 --> 1:30:45.416
Both. I know how Grail
got your fingerprints.

1:30:45.500 --> 1:30:47.416
Oxidized phosphorus dust

1:30:48.333 --> 1:30:50.708
lifted from the table
and applied to the knife.

1:30:51.791 --> 1:30:52.625
You're innocent.

1:30:53.916 --> 1:30:55.041
You doubted it?

1:30:55.791 --> 1:30:57.541
Nothing's certain till it's proved.

1:30:59.416 --> 1:31:00.500
And your case?

1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:03.166
My adversary, his trail,

1:31:03.791 --> 1:31:04.916
it leads here.

1:31:06.875 --> 1:31:08.833
It seems our cases are connected.

1:31:11.083 --> 1:31:11.958
Shall we?

1:31:44.500 --> 1:31:45.416
William Lyon.

1:31:46.875 --> 1:31:48.416
Sarah's love.

1:31:48.500 --> 1:31:50.791
And my thief in a taper crown hat.

1:31:57.458 --> 1:32:01.000
Stay unemotional. There's nothing more
we can do for him now.

1:32:01.708 --> 1:32:04.375
Need to keep our minds fresh
and our eyes sharp.

1:32:04.875 --> 1:32:06.250
He was seized.

1:32:07.583 --> 1:32:10.500
-Yes, and searched.
-For the document he took?

1:32:11.833 --> 1:32:12.666
A knife?

1:32:13.250 --> 1:32:14.250
No, bigger.

1:32:15.833 --> 1:32:16.791
A cutlass.

1:32:18.916 --> 1:32:20.208
Heavy boot scuffs,

1:32:21.625 --> 1:32:24.208
and scratch marks from a cane
that has a metal ferrule.

1:32:26.083 --> 1:32:27.250
Grail.

1:32:28.291 --> 1:32:29.791
But at whose behest?

1:32:30.916 --> 1:32:32.666
There was another in this room.

1:32:32.750 --> 1:32:34.333
This cigar had a holder.

1:32:38.041 --> 1:32:39.708
And traces of wool.

1:32:42.083 --> 1:32:44.625
Astrakhan, the finest.

1:32:44.708 --> 1:32:49.083
Well, Lord McIntyre,
if I, um, might suggest a little lunch.

1:32:50.416 --> 1:32:53.166
Leave me be, please.
They're watching.

1:32:56.583 --> 1:32:58.041
Where did William steal from?

1:32:58.541 --> 1:33:00.583
-The Treasury Office?
-Yes.

1:33:00.666 --> 1:33:03.333
The office of Lord McIntyre,
Treasury Minister.

1:33:03.916 --> 1:33:05.166
How did you come to that?

1:33:06.375 --> 1:33:08.500
I think what William stole was proof

1:33:08.583 --> 1:33:11.500
that Lyon and McIntyre
were conspiring together.

1:33:12.583 --> 1:33:14.208
-Corruption.
-Yes.

1:33:14.291 --> 1:33:16.041
Fueled by greed.

1:33:16.708 --> 1:33:20.083
McIntyre has been secretly profiting
from the factory.

1:33:20.166 --> 1:33:23.041
They changed the match formula
to a cheaper phosphorus,

1:33:24.541 --> 1:33:25.708
and it's deadly.

1:33:26.333 --> 1:33:27.208
Enola?

1:33:27.291 --> 1:33:28.833
Enola, I was concerned for you.

1:33:28.916 --> 1:33:31.708
You left me out there in the dark,
and I nearly tore my…

1:33:35.208 --> 1:33:37.125
-Sherlock Holmes? How do--
-Not the time.

1:33:39.416 --> 1:33:40.291
Oh my…

1:33:41.666 --> 1:33:43.000
-Is he--
-Stay unemotional.

1:33:44.833 --> 1:33:47.166
-Who did this?
-Lord McIntyre.

1:33:47.750 --> 1:33:49.791
-No.
-But it all fits.

1:33:49.875 --> 1:33:53.083
No one has sat in this chair.
No marks on the carpet, no indentation.

1:33:53.166 --> 1:33:56.291
The cigar has been smoked, but cold.

1:33:57.125 --> 1:33:59.625
And look, no ash.

1:34:01.875 --> 1:34:04.541
-No lips have touched that glass.
-Exactly.

1:34:04.625 --> 1:34:07.125
These clues
have been planted for us to find,

1:34:07.708 --> 1:34:09.250
to mislead us from the true villain.

1:34:10.250 --> 1:34:11.500
This has all been staged.

1:34:13.250 --> 1:34:14.083
By who?

1:34:14.833 --> 1:34:18.958
Not McIntyre, but by someone who had
a lot to lose without that document.

1:34:19.041 --> 1:34:22.000
Someone who knew what they were up to
and was blackmailing them.

1:34:23.375 --> 1:34:24.375
My opponent.

1:34:27.208 --> 1:34:28.875
Someone who likes a game.

1:34:30.833 --> 1:34:34.083
-Did they get what they wanted?
-No, I don't think so.

1:34:36.958 --> 1:34:37.833
Poor William.

1:34:47.708 --> 1:34:48.541
Hm.

1:34:55.416 --> 1:34:58.541
-They did get something.
-Mae's terrible music.

1:34:59.208 --> 1:35:00.916
"The Truth of the Gods."

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.750
Could be biblical, mythical.

1:35:02.833 --> 1:35:03.708
Theatrical?

1:35:07.416 --> 1:35:10.166
The Gods is the top row of the theater.

1:35:10.833 --> 1:35:11.708
The balcony.

1:35:12.916 --> 1:35:14.125
Doesn't everyone know that?

1:35:16.083 --> 1:35:17.208
This isn't music.

1:35:26.125 --> 1:35:27.000
It's a map.

1:35:36.958 --> 1:35:39.625
Just to be clear
as to what we might be about to face…

1:35:40.958 --> 1:35:43.541
There may be some violence.
You've faced it before.

1:35:44.458 --> 1:35:45.333
Yes.

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:47.791
I did have part of a suit of armor on.

1:35:48.291 --> 1:35:51.416
But yes, fighting will be…

1:35:52.458 --> 1:35:53.291
Yes.

1:35:53.375 --> 1:35:55.750
-You've been in a fight before?
-Yes, plenty of fights.

1:35:55.833 --> 1:35:56.958
Fenced for my school.

1:35:57.875 --> 1:35:58.708
Mm.

1:36:02.458 --> 1:36:04.458
Fine. Can you teach me to fight?

1:36:05.375 --> 1:36:07.833
What, right now? In a carriage?

1:36:07.916 --> 1:36:10.916
Did I not teach you to dance
in five minutes in a bathroom?

1:36:12.083 --> 1:36:14.166
All right. Fine.

1:36:18.166 --> 1:36:21.750
There are two secrets to fighting.
Avoid the punch, make the counterpunch.

1:36:23.250 --> 1:36:24.916
I don't see how two secrets-- Ow!

1:36:26.041 --> 1:36:27.375
Your first lesson.

1:36:27.458 --> 1:36:28.291
Ow.

1:36:29.416 --> 1:36:30.375
Ow!

1:36:30.458 --> 1:36:32.583
Your second. You didn't avoid the punch.

1:36:32.666 --> 1:36:35.833
-You can hardly expect me to hit a girl.
-Oh dear.

1:36:35.916 --> 1:36:36.750
I'm not some-- Ow!

1:36:37.625 --> 1:36:38.958
Ow! Will you stop that?

1:36:39.458 --> 1:36:41.000
I can't stop.

1:36:42.583 --> 1:36:45.958
-We're approaching.

1:37:11.416 --> 1:37:13.166
I may need more of those lessons.

1:37:38.583 --> 1:37:40.250
X marks the spot.

1:37:59.791 --> 1:38:00.791
Sarah.

1:38:03.583 --> 1:38:04.458
It's all there.

1:38:06.250 --> 1:38:07.750
All the proof we need.

1:38:09.458 --> 1:38:12.666
The contract
between Lyon and McIntyre

1:38:13.541 --> 1:38:15.083
to change the phosphorus.

1:38:17.375 --> 1:38:19.000
What William stole for you.

1:38:24.166 --> 1:38:27.541
And the pages from the factory register.

1:38:27.625 --> 1:38:29.750
That's what you stole from the office.

1:38:31.125 --> 1:38:33.333
These are the names
of the girls they killed.

1:38:33.416 --> 1:38:35.208
I couldn't let 'em be forgotten.

1:38:37.125 --> 1:38:40.958
And it's proof that match girls
are dying from working in that factory,

1:38:41.458 --> 1:38:42.833
and they knew it all along.

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.291
You're a bloody good detective,
Enola Holmes.

1:38:49.708 --> 1:38:51.250
You are too, Sarah Chapman.

1:38:55.416 --> 1:38:57.750
I will share this with the world,
I promise you.

1:38:59.875 --> 1:39:00.708
Thank you.

1:39:02.291 --> 1:39:05.041
Now we must find William.
He was supposed to meet me six hours ago.

1:39:07.500 --> 1:39:10.083
I'm afraid William won't be coming.

1:39:15.833 --> 1:39:16.666
What?

1:39:20.250 --> 1:39:21.083
I'm sorry.

1:39:22.750 --> 1:39:24.083
I'm so sorry.

1:39:30.041 --> 1:39:32.000
I told him we had everything we needed.

1:39:33.250 --> 1:39:34.750
That we should just go public.

1:39:37.625 --> 1:39:41.583
He said nobody would care unless we had
someone in power who would listen.

1:39:44.458 --> 1:39:46.583
He was just trying to keep me safe.

1:39:48.916 --> 1:39:50.041
And now I've lost him.

1:39:50.791 --> 1:39:53.000
We must move quickly,
or we'll lose you too.

1:39:54.083 --> 1:39:55.791
Losing this…

1:39:58.458 --> 1:39:59.708
losing that.

1:40:03.458 --> 1:40:05.625
-Seems you've lost everything.
-Bessie!

1:40:06.166 --> 1:40:08.083
You've all been very careless.

1:40:14.083 --> 1:40:15.041
I'll take those.

1:40:15.125 --> 1:40:16.333
Let go of her.

1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:20.708
Give me the papers and I will.

1:40:35.875 --> 1:40:37.208
Run, Bessie!

1:40:43.250 --> 1:40:46.333
-Don't just stand there!

1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:53.375
Ow!

1:40:53.458 --> 1:40:56.750
-Get after them!

1:41:12.750 --> 1:41:14.833
Ow.

1:41:20.166 --> 1:41:21.958
Avoid the punch, make the counterpunch.

1:41:44.916 --> 1:41:45.833
Tewkesbury!

1:42:47.041 --> 1:42:48.250
Argh!

1:42:48.333 --> 1:42:49.166
Argh.

1:42:54.541 --> 1:42:55.500
No!

1:43:05.750 --> 1:43:07.125
Bessie!

1:43:08.708 --> 1:43:10.000
Run.

1:43:11.291 --> 1:43:12.541
I said run!

1:43:57.041 --> 1:43:58.041
Enola!

1:44:05.166 --> 1:44:08.125
-You got more to you than I thought.

1:45:14.250 --> 1:45:15.083
Huh.

1:45:17.416 --> 1:45:19.583
What places we find ourselves in.

1:45:24.666 --> 1:45:26.291
What places indeed.

1:45:30.458 --> 1:45:32.833
I've always loved the theater.

1:45:36.958 --> 1:45:37.791
Got it?

1:45:37.875 --> 1:45:41.916
I used to dream
I'd end up on the stage.

1:45:43.875 --> 1:45:45.083
You're not rid of me yet,

1:45:45.166 --> 1:45:47.250
Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.

1:45:57.583 --> 1:45:59.083
Enola!

1:46:06.208 --> 1:46:07.541
-Hurrah!

1:46:18.833 --> 1:46:19.875
Are you all right?

1:46:26.500 --> 1:46:27.875
You were made to fight.

1:46:39.500 --> 1:46:40.958
Congratulations.

1:46:43.083 --> 1:46:45.416
Lord McIntyre.
What are you doing here?

1:46:45.500 --> 1:46:47.833
I was summoned.

1:46:48.666 --> 1:46:52.416
Your brother knew that I would want
to see the right people shown justice.

1:46:52.500 --> 1:46:54.666
And I don't know how to thank you

1:46:54.750 --> 1:46:57.291
for retrieving this government property

1:46:57.375 --> 1:46:59.666
and, uh, bringing this killer to light.

1:46:59.750 --> 1:47:03.583
A rot amongst our ranks.

1:47:06.166 --> 1:47:09.416
The world shall know
the name Enola Holmes,

1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:10.666
I'll make sure of it.

1:47:12.500 --> 1:47:14.541
Lestrade, arrest that girl.

1:47:15.541 --> 1:47:17.833
-She's done nothing wrong.

1:47:17.916 --> 1:47:19.833
On what charge, sir?

1:47:19.916 --> 1:47:23.458
-Theft.
-All she stole from you was the truth.

1:47:23.541 --> 1:47:25.708
She took personal information,

1:47:26.625 --> 1:47:30.625
which she used
for extortion and blackmail.

1:47:30.708 --> 1:47:33.416
Which is why she will serve her time.

1:47:33.916 --> 1:47:34.750
Ah.

1:47:36.958 --> 1:47:38.083
But you are mistaken.

1:47:39.166 --> 1:47:42.041
She was not your blackmailer.

1:47:42.541 --> 1:47:45.416
I summoned you here
to draw that very person out.

1:47:46.041 --> 1:47:47.791
The accounting was masterful.

1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:52.791
A tangle of roots,
but all pointed to one pocket.

1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:57.375
One person
receiving the fruits of their schemes

1:47:57.458 --> 1:47:58.750
with no one noticing.

1:48:00.375 --> 1:48:03.416
Hearing everything, seeing everything.

1:48:04.791 --> 1:48:06.833
Ignored for years.

1:48:06.916 --> 1:48:08.333
Playing them all.

1:48:09.708 --> 1:48:10.708
It's all a game.

1:48:12.708 --> 1:48:15.750
And it's fun, once you know the rules.

1:48:21.500 --> 1:48:22.416
Miss Mira Troy.

1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:24.583
Absurd.

1:48:25.541 --> 1:48:27.083
Oh, I don't believe it.

1:48:28.500 --> 1:48:32.125
It's remarkable
what can be done

1:48:32.208 --> 1:48:35.875
when people underestimate you.

1:48:37.208 --> 1:48:38.666
And then came the problem.

1:48:39.875 --> 1:48:41.125
William stole the contract.

1:48:41.208 --> 1:48:43.083
He threatened to cut off your money train.

1:48:43.166 --> 1:48:44.541
And you couldn't have that.

1:48:45.250 --> 1:48:47.708
You hired Grail to retrieve the document,

1:48:48.666 --> 1:48:50.916
but things got out of hand,

1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.208
so you tried to point us to Lord McIntyre.

1:48:54.208 --> 1:48:56.083
A rare misstep in your game…

1:48:58.125 --> 1:48:59.166
Moriarty.

1:49:06.291 --> 1:49:10.833
Such a shame our divertissement
has to end, Mr. Holmes.

1:49:12.083 --> 1:49:16.208
I was so enjoying it.

1:49:17.791 --> 1:49:20.416
And you, Enola.

1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:24.458
Miss Troy, you have been behind this?

1:49:25.916 --> 1:49:29.333
Of course, you never can find
the proper staff.

1:49:30.041 --> 1:49:31.750
I only wanted the agreements back.

1:49:32.708 --> 1:49:35.333
Though I couldn't be seen
to question William myself,

1:49:35.416 --> 1:49:37.291
you were so obliging.

1:49:39.083 --> 1:49:43.166
If you wish to speak with William,
you could always try with that.

1:49:46.875 --> 1:49:51.041
Just a pity he was smarter
and braver in the end than I'd expected.

1:49:51.125 --> 1:49:55.666
They both were.
Their deaths were so unnecessary.

1:49:56.291 --> 1:50:02.958
But Superintendent Grail
was somewhat of a blunt instrument.

1:50:03.541 --> 1:50:04.958
You!

1:50:05.041 --> 1:50:07.875
How dare you take advantage
of your position!

1:50:10.833 --> 1:50:13.166
I take advantage?

1:50:14.875 --> 1:50:17.583
What were my advantages?

1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:22.833
Treated like a common servant
when I have twice the mind of yours.

1:50:24.958 --> 1:50:26.416
Any of yours.

1:50:28.833 --> 1:50:32.625
Why shouldn't I have a share
of your ill-begotten riches

1:50:32.708 --> 1:50:35.125
and punish you at the same time?

1:50:36.208 --> 1:50:39.458
Why shouldn't I be rewarded
for what I can do?

1:50:40.791 --> 1:50:46.041
Where is my place in this… society?

1:50:46.750 --> 1:50:48.416
I am a woman.

1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:50.833
I cannot join clubs,

1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:52.583
I cannot own shares,

1:50:52.666 --> 1:50:55.583
I cannot advance myself as they can.

1:50:56.791 --> 1:50:57.625
So…

1:51:00.416 --> 1:51:03.000
I found my own way.

1:51:05.375 --> 1:51:10.125
And it was fun.

1:51:14.500 --> 1:51:15.833
Lestrade,

1:51:17.666 --> 1:51:19.666
take her away.

1:51:19.750 --> 1:51:20.583
Yes, sir.

1:51:23.041 --> 1:51:24.041
On what charge, sir?

1:51:24.958 --> 1:51:26.833
-Extortion.
-Uh, yes, yes.

1:51:26.916 --> 1:51:27.875
Blackmail, murder.

1:51:28.750 --> 1:51:29.583
Go.

1:51:30.083 --> 1:51:33.708
Such a shame our little dance has to end.

1:51:35.041 --> 1:51:36.666
For now at least.

1:51:36.750 --> 1:51:38.833
Perhaps we shall take to the floor again.

1:51:47.083 --> 1:51:48.083
No!

1:51:48.791 --> 1:51:50.208
No!

1:51:52.041 --> 1:51:54.250
Well, there. That's that then.

1:51:56.166 --> 1:51:59.166
I accidentally burnt my own property.
What of it?

1:52:00.458 --> 1:52:03.041
You are corrupt, sir.

1:52:03.125 --> 1:52:05.833
And complicit in the deaths
of hundreds of match girls.

1:52:07.208 --> 1:52:08.500
Where is your proof?

1:52:10.250 --> 1:52:11.291
Good.

1:52:11.375 --> 1:52:14.958
So… back to business.

1:52:16.291 --> 1:52:18.166
-Sir, you cannot--
-Tewkesbury.

1:52:20.875 --> 1:52:21.708
Patience.

1:52:28.833 --> 1:52:29.833
Glory be.

1:52:41.916 --> 1:52:44.833
All those names, those lives,

1:52:45.833 --> 1:52:46.916
I failed 'em, Enola.

1:52:47.583 --> 1:52:48.708
Don't say that.

1:52:50.458 --> 1:52:51.333
Mae gone…

1:52:54.375 --> 1:52:55.250
William gone,

1:52:56.791 --> 1:52:58.541
and they're gonna get away with it.

1:52:59.750 --> 1:53:01.750
You heard the man. "Where's your proof?"

1:53:03.291 --> 1:53:04.291
What do we have now?

1:53:09.166 --> 1:53:10.375
We have each other…

1:53:13.583 --> 1:53:15.166
and we have the truth.

1:53:27.041 --> 1:53:29.875
You're late, Bess Chapman.
Docking you a penny.

1:53:32.625 --> 1:53:33.541
Oi.

1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:36.625
You're not welcome here no more.

1:53:38.208 --> 1:53:40.125
What are you doing? Oi!

1:53:40.708 --> 1:53:41.541
Get down.

1:53:42.250 --> 1:53:43.541
Get down!

1:53:44.041 --> 1:53:45.750
Let her speak!

1:53:49.833 --> 1:53:51.041
A few weeks ago,

1:53:52.750 --> 1:53:55.666
Mae Izley, William Lyon, and I

1:53:55.750 --> 1:53:57.375
set out to prove something.

1:53:59.041 --> 1:54:01.333
To prove that this factory
was killing people,

1:54:02.791 --> 1:54:03.958
and they knew it.

1:54:04.041 --> 1:54:07.458
But they decided that profit
mattered more than we did.

1:54:08.916 --> 1:54:11.166
-You're coming with me.
-Shh!

1:54:11.250 --> 1:54:14.333
It ain't typhus that's killing us.
It's the phosphorus.

1:54:15.041 --> 1:54:16.750
What we work with every day.

1:54:17.750 --> 1:54:19.750
You lying little toerag.

1:54:19.833 --> 1:54:21.375
That's a penny off your wages!

1:54:23.750 --> 1:54:25.083
These were our friends…

1:54:27.416 --> 1:54:28.500
our sisters…

1:54:33.791 --> 1:54:35.083
and our children.

1:54:36.875 --> 1:54:39.291
Well, it stops now.

1:54:41.458 --> 1:54:44.625
It's time for us to use
the only thing we have. Ourselves.

1:54:45.500 --> 1:54:49.250
It's time for us to refuse to work.

1:54:49.333 --> 1:54:51.000
It's time to tell 'em no.

1:54:51.791 --> 1:54:53.666
-Right, get back to work.
-No!

1:54:55.208 --> 1:54:57.625
You leave here, there is no coming back.

1:54:59.125 --> 1:55:01.375
You will not get employed here again.

1:55:02.875 --> 1:55:05.958
Well, will you join me?

1:55:09.541 --> 1:55:11.000
Think of your families.

1:55:11.833 --> 1:55:13.125
Don't do it, girls.

1:55:13.208 --> 1:55:15.666
It is not worth the risk.

1:55:16.375 --> 1:55:17.208
Well,

1:55:18.916 --> 1:55:19.791
will ya?

1:55:20.375 --> 1:55:22.416
This is how the world works.

1:55:23.625 --> 1:55:24.458
Please, girls.

1:55:26.333 --> 1:55:28.541
I know you're scared. I am too.

1:55:28.625 --> 1:55:30.333
But it's the only power we have!

1:55:37.791 --> 1:55:38.625
Right,

1:55:40.416 --> 1:55:42.916
get that machine back on
and get back to work.

1:55:49.833 --> 1:55:50.666
Right.

1:55:54.166 --> 1:55:55.000
No.

1:55:56.500 --> 1:55:58.000
This can't be their future.

1:55:59.208 --> 1:56:00.166
I'm sorry, Enola.

1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:10.541
-Stop that.

1:56:19.083 --> 1:56:20.750
-Stop that.

1:56:25.958 --> 1:56:27.250
Be one voice.

1:56:31.458 --> 1:56:33.541
-That's enough!

1:56:45.916 --> 1:56:46.916
Stop that!

1:56:57.500 --> 1:56:59.541
Can't anyone control these bloody women?

1:57:06.083 --> 1:57:07.083
Come on, girls.

1:57:44.916 --> 1:57:47.375
-Where are you going?
-Westminster!

1:57:50.083 --> 1:57:51.000
There they go.

1:57:52.041 --> 1:57:53.500
That's a whole lot of noise.

1:57:54.958 --> 1:57:56.916
She likes causing trouble, doesn't she?

1:57:57.500 --> 1:57:59.958
It's as if she was molded that way.

1:58:03.333 --> 1:58:04.916
She still needs that haircut.

1:58:15.083 --> 1:58:17.458
Seems your boy has learned how to fight.

1:58:19.500 --> 1:58:20.916
Lord McIntyre.

1:58:25.333 --> 1:58:26.166
Indeed.

1:58:27.375 --> 1:58:28.291
He's not my boy.

1:58:35.083 --> 1:58:36.583
"Pay what you can."

1:58:37.291 --> 1:58:39.916
And what will people pay you in?
Potatoes and gratitude?

1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:41.333
If that's all they have.

1:58:41.416 --> 1:58:44.541
You can deal with the hoits and toits.
This is where I should be.

1:58:45.125 --> 1:58:47.125
Edith said she'll be kind with the rent.

1:58:48.750 --> 1:58:54.291
You know, you are aware, should you wish
some finer surrounds, I could, uh…

1:58:56.416 --> 1:58:57.291
I was thinking…

1:59:00.250 --> 1:59:01.416
Holmes and Holmes?

1:59:04.250 --> 1:59:05.083
A partnership?

1:59:09.041 --> 1:59:11.041
That is the kindest offer.

1:59:12.333 --> 1:59:15.458
But if I did that,
I would always be in your shadow.

1:59:16.250 --> 1:59:17.458
Hm. Yes.

1:59:21.833 --> 1:59:24.083
Though I do like this new version of you.

1:59:24.875 --> 1:59:26.708
No one should be alone all the time.

1:59:28.083 --> 1:59:29.375
A friend would do you well.

1:59:31.875 --> 1:59:33.541
Perhaps I should write that down.

1:59:37.500 --> 1:59:39.375
I shall drop by to check on you.

1:59:40.041 --> 1:59:41.125
I would like that.

1:59:41.916 --> 1:59:45.125
Perhaps you could come to Baker Street
from time to time…

1:59:47.208 --> 1:59:48.208
to check on me.

1:59:52.416 --> 1:59:56.000
Perhaps we can fix on Thursday, 4 p.m.

1:59:56.916 --> 1:59:58.166
Thursday at- 00 it is.

2:00:00.666 --> 2:00:03.416
It seems I shan't be the last
to interrupt you today.

2:00:05.625 --> 2:00:06.625
And he has flowers.

2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:11.666
-Sherlock.
-Tewkesbury.

2:00:11.750 --> 2:00:14.041
-See you on Thursday.
-Bye, Sherlock.

2:00:23.208 --> 2:00:24.375
-Sherlock?
-Yes.

2:00:24.458 --> 2:00:25.375
Your paper.

2:00:26.250 --> 2:00:27.083
Thank you.

2:00:27.666 --> 2:00:28.500
And…

2:00:30.125 --> 2:00:32.666
thank you… for everything.

2:00:51.708 --> 2:00:54.708
Tewkesbury, when did I give you
the impression that I like flowers?

2:00:54.791 --> 2:00:57.458
They're called Spreading Bellflowers.
Wild, of course.

2:00:58.041 --> 2:01:00.791
Attracted to ancient woodland,
wiry, deceptive,

2:01:01.458 --> 2:01:03.458
refuse to behave according to any rules,

2:01:03.541 --> 2:01:07.958
but their petals are so delicate,
and their flowers--

2:01:08.041 --> 2:01:09.000
Two things.

2:01:09.083 --> 2:01:12.041
Your metaphor is tortured,
and I don't have delicate petals.

2:01:12.125 --> 2:01:13.500
Oh, and, and, and…

2:01:14.916 --> 2:01:18.166
It is an invitation to a ball
being given by--

2:01:18.250 --> 2:01:22.333
Uh, I am not going to a ball with you.
I got arrested at the last one.

2:01:23.666 --> 2:01:26.875
Well, all the more reason to dance again,
wouldn't you say?

2:01:26.958 --> 2:01:30.083
-You're a nincompoop.
-And you are a coward.

2:01:30.166 --> 2:01:33.041
How dare you speak to a lady
like that? You are a disgrace, sir.

2:01:33.125 --> 2:01:35.250
And yet
you still hold my arm.

2:01:36.041 --> 2:01:37.958
And yet I still hold your arm.

2:02:18.250 --> 2:02:19.291
Sherlock Holmes?

2:02:20.166 --> 2:02:21.291
Yes.

2:02:22.166 --> 2:02:23.583
I'm here for my appointment.

2:02:25.458 --> 2:02:26.458
You're seeking a flatmate?

2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.125
-You must have the wrong address.
-Really?

2:02:32.958 --> 2:02:35.958
The young lady was very clear
as to the place a-and the time.

2:02:37.208 --> 2:02:39.166
-"Thursday at- 00," she said.

2:02:39.250 --> 2:02:41.000
-You are Sherlock Holmes?
-Hm.

2:02:42.708 --> 2:02:43.541
Yes.

2:02:44.791 --> 2:02:46.791
Please, do come in, Mr…?

2:02:46.875 --> 2:02:47.708
Doctor.

2:02:48.791 --> 2:02:49.625
Watson.

2:02:50.500 --> 2:02:51.625
John Watson.

2:04:18.041 --> 2:04:18.958


2:04:19.041 --> 2:04:21.500
