20:14.588 --> 20:16.298
and the niece that fell from the sky.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.717
-Yeah!

20:17.758 --> 20:19.468
Totally.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.143
That's different.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.274
Oh. Shrieking Squirrels.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.694
I know, right? It's horrible.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.946
No, no. It's the name of the band.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.281
They dropped, like, yesterday on an indie site.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.993
Jack and Emma are nowhere near that cool.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.995
Oh.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.747
She's in there.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.125
Oh.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.799
Oh.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.634
Okay. That's it. I am done.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.095
Em, we've had two.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.596
-Yeah.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.805
Seems like more.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.267
Did, uh

21:08.308 --> 21:10.310
Does a bear shit in his pants? Hold on.

21:10.352 --> 21:14.398
Yeah, I don't think that's the, um, expression.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.486
-Okay. -No, wait. No. We can't --

21:19.528 --> 21:21.114
We -- We can't do this. No.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.865
We have a lot of important decisions to make.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.159
We have to talk about a bunch of stuff.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.911
We can't be stoned for this.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.871
We have to be honest.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.623
Right.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.254
Maybe we should have a shot first.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.839
-Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.967
"You're such a great guy, Andy."

21:41.008 --> 21:43.219
"You're the best, Andy."

21:43.261 --> 21:45.304
"It's not you. It's me, Andy."

21:45.345 --> 21:49.516
"You're like human-shaped Ambien, Andy."

21:49.558 --> 21:52.103
No. Somebody seriously wrote that to you?

21:52.145 --> 21:54.480
The -- The last one was implicit.

21:54.521 --> 21:58.734
All right. Well, next round's on, uh...

21:58.776 --> 22:00.987
What are you doing?

22:01.028 --> 22:02.571
That's how I know her.

22:02.613 --> 22:03.781
Know who?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.407
That girl I just dropped off.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.827
You come in with her a lot.

22:07.868 --> 22:08.869
Izzy?

22:08.911 --> 22:12.081
Sure. That sounds about right.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.128
Good, right

22:17.170 --> 22:19.130
Why would you do that?

22:19.172 --> 22:22.716
Sorry, I-I can't listen to music and talk at the same time.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.384
Is that gonna happen to me?

22:24.426 --> 22:27.721
Item one on the agenda is Andy.

22:28.973 --> 22:33.602
Uh, no. Um...

22:33.644 --> 22:35.771
I was just trying to make you guys jealous.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.190
Yeah, it worked.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.356
Really?

22:38.398 --> 22:40.067
Why?

22:41.610 --> 22:44.071
'Cause I needed to know if...

22:44.113 --> 22:46.324
You know -- I don't know.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.242
We felt the same?

22:48.284 --> 22:49.535
Yeah.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.039
I have been going out of my mind

22:53.080 --> 22:54.999
thinking about a married couple

22:55.041 --> 22:57.918
that I met four days ago getting it on without me.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.046
And, by the way, I know how crazy that sounds.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.089
Like, if anyone was to say that shit to me,

23:02.131 --> 23:03.757
I would be like, "You're mental."

23:03.799 --> 23:05.218
Like, I -- Like, I-I get it.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.303
Well, I'm jealous when you're with Andy.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.096
I'm jealous when you're with Jack.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.931
-Yes.

23:10.973 --> 23:13.100
Yeah. Me too. I'm super jealous.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.978
Like, not, obviously Ja-- I am Jack, so it's --

23:16.020 --> 23:18.189
it's opposite people,

23:18.231 --> 23:22.442
but I have the same feelings as you guys.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.824
How fucked up is this?

23:30.826 --> 23:34.038
Who decides what's fucked up and what isn't?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.956
Society, for one.

23:35.998 --> 23:39.210
Or, you know, the people doing it.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.836
Right. That's -- That's actually way better.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.671
Mm-hmm.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.258
Well, whenever we tried to make this a business arrangement,

23:45.299 --> 23:46.675
some weird form of therapy --

23:46.717 --> 23:48.635
No, it was -- it was always something else,

23:48.677 --> 23:50.054
right from the start, right?

23:52.890 --> 23:54.267
Hold on.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.192
-No.

24:03.234 --> 24:06.862
♪♪

24:10.908 --> 24:13.077
Now we can't hide behind it.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.746
Andy: So, let me get this straight.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.332
You -- You drove Izzy out to the 'burbs

24:18.374 --> 24:20.584
and you dropped her off in the woods?

24:20.626 --> 24:21.668
Yeah.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.296
Dude, I-I'm starting to feel

24:23.337 --> 24:25.505
like I'm breaking a whole bunch of unwritten laws.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.674
Well, you're not a lawyer or a doctor.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.051
You're, like, a bartender

24:29.093 --> 24:31.511
who occasionally drives people places, so...

24:31.553 --> 24:33.347
Wow.

24:33.389 --> 24:37.851
Your powers of persuasion need some fine-tuning there, sport.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.477
Jack: So, where do we go from here?

24:39.519 --> 24:42.273
I don't know.

24:42.315 --> 24:47.027
The logical question is, um...

24:47.069 --> 24:51.324
has anyone in this room ever had a threesome?

24:55.953 --> 24:58.831
Oh, well, now, that's just offensive.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.249
Oh, shit.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.834
No, I-I thought you were suggesting that, like --

25:01.875 --> 25:03.252
Well, yeah, no.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.711
I was suggesting, completely suggesting,

25:04.753 --> 25:07.131
but, I mean, it's not 1975, Barney Miller.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.383
Come on.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.430
No.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.849
Uh, no. Not me. No.

25:16.890 --> 25:17.766
Izzy?

25:17.808 --> 25:20.227
No.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.979
No. Me neither.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.942
Here's what's gonna happen.

25:26.984 --> 25:33.032
I'm going to put $80 on this bar, okay?

25:33.073 --> 25:35.284
I'm gonna ask you to tell me

25:35.326 --> 25:37.703
exactly where you dropped her off.
