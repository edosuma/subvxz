- Ghostbusters!
- Ghostbusters!

02:29.131 --> 02:30.826
Yeah!

02:31.299 --> 02:32.493
We did it, man!

02:34.670 --> 02:37.195
- Be seeing you.
- You got it, man.

02:37.406 --> 02:38.896
- Have a great trip.
- Yeah.

02:39.107 --> 02:41.507
When I'm done with probation,
I'm gonna come find you.

02:41.710 --> 02:43.143
I know you will.

02:45.113 --> 02:47.274
All right, I'm out of here.

02:49.151 --> 02:50.743
One last thing.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.119
- Remember this?
- My Indy compass.

02:53.321 --> 02:55.152
- In case you get lost.
- Where'd you get this?

02:55.357 --> 02:57.154
- And you will get lost.
- Yeah, I will get lost.

02:57.359 --> 02:58.519
But it's half the fun.

02:58.727 --> 03:00.661
- Thanks, man.
- Be good.

03:02.164 --> 03:04.462
- Take care of those two fools.
- Have fun.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.395
I will.

03:06.601 --> 03:09.001
Catch you around, boys!

03:11.473 --> 03:13.498
Bye, Billy!

03:16.244 --> 03:17.939
I wonder where he's gonna end up.

03:18.146 --> 03:20.114
He's gonna do great things.

03:20.315 --> 03:24.115
Don't worry. We're all gonna do
great things.

03:27.923 --> 03:31.290
- Are you ready for Tom?
- I'm ready for Tom!

03:31.660 --> 03:33.890
- Let's ride!
- Come on, baby!

03:35.731 --> 03:36.891
Yeah!

03:38.266 --> 03:39.790
Angie!

03:40.001 --> 03:41.332
What was that?

03:41.536 --> 03:43.367
Shit. I think it's Tony.

03:43.572 --> 03:45.062
- Tony?!
- Get your clothes on!

03:45.273 --> 03:48.208
- What happened to "Tony's in China"?
- Oh, this is bad. Get your clothes on...

03:50.579 --> 03:52.137
Hey, Tony.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.314
You're home early, baby.

03:54.516 --> 03:57.246
- Tony?
- What the hell's going on here?

03:59.688 --> 04:02.282
Tony, there's enough of me
to go around.

04:02.491 --> 04:04.823
I'm thinking about a Tom sandwich.

04:05.127 --> 04:06.219
Light on the Tom.

04:09.865 --> 04:12.390
Jerry here has the reworked formula,

04:12.601 --> 04:15.502
so I'll pass the ball on to him.

04:15.704 --> 04:17.262
You're on.

04:21.276 --> 04:24.074
- Now?
- Now.

04:26.414 --> 04:27.813
Right.

04:43.064 --> 04:45.157
Baby! You're home.

04:45.367 --> 04:46.834
Hey.

04:49.137 --> 04:50.900
How was the surf?

04:51.106 --> 04:52.937
Someone's happy to see me.

04:53.141 --> 04:55.837
Well, why wouldn't I be?
Especially tonight.

04:59.514 --> 05:01.004
You outdid yourself.

05:01.216 --> 05:03.650
Just seemed like the right night
to outdo oneself, so...

05:05.220 --> 05:06.881
A Thursday?

05:07.088 --> 05:09.989
Honey, don't you think every night
should be special?

05:10.192 --> 05:13.559
Yeah. Yes, every night
should be special, this is true.

05:13.762 --> 05:15.093
But, really...

05:15.297 --> 05:19.393
..specifically, there's always one night
a year that just seems right

05:19.601 --> 05:22.536
for a celebration of a specific event.

05:23.538 --> 05:26.769
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- Absolutely.

05:26.975 --> 05:28.636
I love dip.

05:28.844 --> 05:30.334
It's our anniversary!

05:30.545 --> 05:34.413
Our first date! How many hints
do I need to give you?!

05:35.984 --> 05:37.884
I must be crazy.

05:39.387 --> 05:41.184
A trip? Great call.
Where we going?

05:41.389 --> 05:44.688
I won't do it. I won't play the role
of nagging girlfriend anymore.

05:44.893 --> 05:46.861
Would nagging wife
make you happier?

05:50.465 --> 05:53.195
Please tell me that was not
you proposing to me.

05:56.371 --> 05:58.202
<i>Jerry and Denise cannot get
to the phone right now,</i>

05:58.406 --> 06:00.237
<i>because we're doing it!</i>

06:01.176 --> 06:03.804
<i>Jerry, it's Mom. If you're there,
will you please pick up.</i>

06:04.012 --> 06:06.845
Hey, Mom. I can't really talk
right now.

06:09.818 --> 06:11.513
What?

06:25.634 --> 06:27.465
Excuse me. Excuse me.

06:27.669 --> 06:30.365
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.

06:30.572 --> 06:31.834
You're in my spot.

06:32.641 --> 06:34.404
I don't see your name on it.

06:34.609 --> 06:37.874
Well, actually, yes, my name is on it.
See? Right there, Dr. Mott.

06:38.079 --> 06:40.104
That's me. That's my space.

06:40.582 --> 06:42.140
You got me.

06:43.251 --> 06:44.377
But look at this, pal!

06:45.020 --> 06:46.988
Now...

06:47.188 --> 06:49.315
..your name's not on it!
- Hey! What're you doing? Hey!

06:49.524 --> 06:52.493
Hey, you get back. You get back.
I'm not afraid to use this!

06:53.428 --> 06:54.952
Hey, don't...!

06:56.564 --> 06:58.464
Have a good day, doc.

06:58.667 --> 06:59.827
You too.

07:11.379 --> 07:13.313
I'm Dr. Mott!

07:24.659 --> 07:26.752
Good morning, Sandi. TGIF.

07:26.962 --> 07:28.452
What's that, Dr. Mott?

07:28.663 --> 07:31.257
Thank Goodness It's Friday.
Happy Friday.

07:31.466 --> 07:33.161
It's the weekend.

07:35.103 --> 07:36.263
Right.

07:40.241 --> 07:42.004
"TGIF."

07:42.811 --> 07:45.803
That was great. So smart.

07:47.148 --> 07:49.708
Why don't you just ask her out,
you dumb-ass.

07:50.185 --> 07:51.447
It's Jerry Conlaine.

07:51.653 --> 07:53.985
- He says it's very important.
- Okay.

07:55.523 --> 07:58.219
<i>- Hey, how you doing? Long time.
- Hey, Dan.</i>

08:00.695 --> 08:02.458
Listen...

08:03.164 --> 08:04.893
There was an accident.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.163
<i>Billy's dead.</i>

08:08.136 --> 08:11.003
<i>- You're kidding.
- Yeah, he...</i>

08:11.639 --> 08:14.005
<i>He was para-surfing
down in Costa Rica.</i>

08:14.676 --> 08:18.373
So the funeral's this weekend.
It's... It's in Oregon.

08:18.580 --> 08:21.242
<i>- Yeah...
- I'm flying out in a couple of hours.</i>

08:21.449 --> 08:22.643
<i>Can you make it?</i>

08:22.851 --> 08:24.751
Yeah, I'll be there.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.397
Dano! Hey.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.365
- Hey, Jerry.
- How's it going?

08:43.405 --> 08:45.498
Oh, man.

08:47.509 --> 08:49.170
Oh, my God, is that Everest?

08:49.377 --> 08:52.437
Yeah. You know Billy.
He wasn't afraid of anything.

08:53.014 --> 08:54.379
He could do it all.

08:54.582 --> 08:56.709
Did you know he ran with the bulls?

08:56.918 --> 08:58.215
He sent me a postcard from Spain.

08:58.420 --> 09:00.445
- Man, he did great things.
- He did.

09:00.655 --> 09:01.917
I still want you.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.422
Why did you leave me?

09:05.627 --> 09:07.288
Oh, Billy.

09:07.962 --> 09:11.090
Billy's dead and he's still got a better
chance of getting laid than I do.

09:14.202 --> 09:18.935
Leadeth me in paths of righteousness
for his name's sake...

09:21.009 --> 09:22.601
I walk through the valley
of the shadow...

09:22.811 --> 09:24.210
Tom's here.

09:24.412 --> 09:26.972
Walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear...

09:36.624 --> 09:38.489
Is this Billy's funeral?

09:40.295 --> 09:41.956
Is that the corpse of Billy Newwood?

09:44.132 --> 09:45.463
Jer, is that you?

09:48.436 --> 09:50.063
You're with Dan?

09:50.939 --> 09:53.533
- Where did you guys park?
- Tom!

09:54.843 --> 09:56.970
Okay. Sorry.

09:57.178 --> 09:59.646
There's a hell of a fender-bender
coming in, and...

09:59.848 --> 10:02.783
- Please continue. I'm so sorry.
- L-5 was a parking lot. I made it.

10:02.984 --> 10:04.611
Then the earth shook and trembled...

10:04.953 --> 10:06.818
Sorry, Padre.

10:07.021 --> 10:08.613
My bad. Missed an exit.

10:08.823 --> 10:11.223
Because he was wroth.

10:11.426 --> 10:18.992
He bowed the heavens also and
came down. And darkness was...

10:19.200 --> 10:21.566
Did you notice how many hot chicks
were at that funeral?

10:21.769 --> 10:26.536
No kidding! It was like a discotheque
with a coffin in the middle.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.338
- Look at that.
- Holy...

10:28.543 --> 10:30.033
Fort Cooper. Can you believe it?

10:30.612 --> 10:32.807
God, I remember it being taller.

10:37.719 --> 10:39.550
There it is.

10:40.321 --> 10:41.686
Race you to the top!

10:48.830 --> 10:50.297
- Dano, come on up!
- Come on, Dan.

10:50.498 --> 10:52.989
You guys are hammered!
I'm not climbing up a 20-year-old rope.

10:53.201 --> 10:54.998
- That's crazy.
- Tommy, catch.

10:55.203 --> 10:58.900
This whole thing seems
a little insane for us to be doing,

10:59.107 --> 11:01.041
climbing with the possibility of...

11:04.379 --> 11:06.904
- You all right, Dano?
- Come on, Dano, grab it.

11:07.115 --> 11:08.377
- Give me the rope.
- Come on, Dan!

11:10.385 --> 11:11.977
Use your tippy-toes. There you go.

11:13.021 --> 11:14.750
Cobweb. Look out.

11:17.325 --> 11:20.658
- Oh, my God.
- How small is that door?

11:20.862 --> 11:22.352
Kind of seems about
the same, actually.

11:22.564 --> 11:24.930
I hope I don't fall through
the floor of this thing.

11:25.867 --> 11:28.529
Hey! What's up, B.A. Baracus?

11:28.736 --> 11:31.136
Mr. T. How awesome is that?

11:31.339 --> 11:34.934
You guys. Oh, my gosh.

11:35.677 --> 11:38.612
- Look at this.
- Hey, that's our old flag.

11:38.813 --> 11:42.510
- D.B. Cooper's treasure chest.
- Oh, man, look at that thing.

11:42.717 --> 11:44.912
- You remember this?
- Of course, yeah.

11:45.119 --> 11:48.179
Cooper parachuted out of a plane
up north with a bunch of stolen cash.

11:48.389 --> 11:49.413
We were obsessed with that.

11:49.624 --> 11:51.285
- Nationwide police hunt and...
- Right.

11:51.492 --> 11:53.255
- Never found.
- Yeah, we were gonna sneak away,

11:53.461 --> 11:56.760
<i>go up the river, all Huck Finn,
Apocalypse Now style.</i>

11:56.965 --> 11:58.733
Get the loot.

11:58.799 --> 12:00.926
I bet you we spent half our childhood
planning that trip.

12:01.135 --> 12:02.898
It's all Billy ever talked about.

12:03.104 --> 12:05.265
- Let's open it up.
- We have to break the lock.

12:05.473 --> 12:07.941
- Oh, I'll break it.
- 38-24-36.

12:08.142 --> 12:10.770
- How did he know that?
- How do you possibly remember that?

12:10.978 --> 12:15.915
Miss 1981, Julie McDonald.
38-24-36. Unforgettable.

12:16.117 --> 12:18.051
Had a passion for cycling.
Disliked liars.

12:18.252 --> 12:19.378
You're right.

12:20.621 --> 12:22.748
- What the?
- Do you believe it?

12:22.957 --> 12:24.288
Man! Look at that.

12:24.492 --> 12:25.891
The oath...

12:26.093 --> 12:28.994
"We swear that these things
will remain in this box

12:29.196 --> 12:31.721
until we find D.B. Cooper's treasure. "

12:32.533 --> 12:34.694
Signed, a bunch of kids.

12:34.902 --> 12:37.564
Remember we pricked our fingers,
took a blood oath?

12:37.772 --> 12:41.003
Dan, what's that next to
your signature? That's not blood.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.573
It was earwax.

12:43.177 --> 12:44.166
I was afraid of needles.

12:45.012 --> 12:47.776
Should we check out the priceless
treasures of our youth?

12:47.982 --> 12:49.415
C-3PO.

12:50.618 --> 12:53.109
- I wonder who put that in.
- Let me see. That's a collectible now.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.788
- Yeah, right.
- My Brian Bosworth rookie card.

12:55.990 --> 12:57.685
- The Boz.
- Man, I thought he was gonna be

12:57.892 --> 12:59.086
the greatest ever.

12:59.593 --> 13:01.823
"I've been in that box
a very long time. "

13:02.029 --> 13:03.690
Well, you're free now.

13:04.431 --> 13:07.628
And, Tom, I believe this
is your contribution.

13:07.835 --> 13:09.598
Oh, my God.

13:09.804 --> 13:11.999
That's my first rubber.

13:12.206 --> 13:13.400
Boy...

13:13.607 --> 13:17.771
I found this in my dad's pickup
right before he went to jail.

13:17.978 --> 13:20.105
I remember he caught me with it.

13:20.314 --> 13:22.612
Boy, he smacked me
right in the head.

13:22.817 --> 13:25.115
What a charming
father-and-son tale.

13:25.319 --> 13:26.718
He was funny.

13:26.921 --> 13:30.379
- Hey, what did Billy put in there?
- Yeah, what does he got?

13:30.591 --> 13:32.218
His Indy compass.

13:32.426 --> 13:35.190
I gave this to him before he took off
on his trip. He must've...

13:35.396 --> 13:36.829
I don't know, he must've put it back.

13:37.031 --> 13:40.831
Look at this. It's one of our mix tapes.
Remember we did the DJ intros?

13:41.035 --> 13:43.026
Yeah, let's not Wang Chung tonight.
Burn that.

13:43.437 --> 13:45.302
You guys, check out this map.

13:45.506 --> 13:47.997
- Looks like Billy left us a treasure map.
- Look at that.

13:48.209 --> 13:50.200
- Not only that...
- This map looks new.

13:50.411 --> 13:52.470
He plotted out the whole trip.

13:52.680 --> 13:56.207
Billy thought D.B. Landed right here.
There's no way he did this as a kid.

13:56.417 --> 13:59.580
He must've been adding to the box
over the years.

13:59.787 --> 14:03.883
This is the camping trip
he wanted us to take last summer.

14:04.091 --> 14:06.059
I couldn't go.
I was detained in Mexico.

14:06.594 --> 14:08.653
And he wouldn't do it
unless we were all together.

14:09.563 --> 14:12.157
I swear to God, I think he figured it out.

14:12.366 --> 14:14.334
I mean, look at all this research.

14:14.535 --> 14:17.663
He reconstructed the jump.
He pinpointed D.B.'s landing.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.695
That's crazy.

14:21.809 --> 14:23.709
My God...

14:23.911 --> 14:26.141
I'm sorry, you guys,

14:26.347 --> 14:28.281
we made an oath.

14:28.482 --> 14:30.006
It all goes back in the box.

14:30.918 --> 14:33.682
It all goes back in the box
until we find the treasure.

14:33.888 --> 14:35.822
So let's go find it.

14:36.023 --> 14:38.583
Let's... Let's take Billy's trip.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.955
- Come on, guys, what do you say?
- I say, "Hell, yes. "

14:42.162 --> 14:44.027
- Hell, yes! Right?
- We'll get a canoe.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.220
- Right?
- No.

14:45.432 --> 14:46.421
No.

14:46.634 --> 14:47.999
No, I'm...

14:48.202 --> 14:49.669
- No.
- We're all going.

14:49.870 --> 14:52.168
- Listen, I wanna get a lot of rope.
- A rope's good.

14:52.373 --> 14:55.365
All right, I know you guys won't grasp
this concept,

14:55.576 --> 14:57.373
but I have patients and...

14:58.279 --> 15:00.474
I am a doctor now.

15:00.681 --> 15:03.377
I am Dr. Mott now!

15:03.884 --> 15:06.546
I have responsibilities!

15:08.522 --> 15:13.428
Your responsibility is to come
treasure hunting with us.

15:15.096 --> 15:16.222
We're 30.

15:16.431 --> 15:18.558
This might be the last chance
we have to do something

15:18.766 --> 15:20.256
incredibly stupid together.

15:22.370 --> 15:24.338
I agree.

15:25.072 --> 15:27.233
For Billy, Dano.

15:29.644 --> 15:31.635
- Not fair.
- I think it's fair.

15:31.846 --> 15:33.177
All right.

15:33.381 --> 15:35.815
Time to re-up on our oath, boys.
Fingers up.

15:36.017 --> 15:38.042
- Hey, put that away. Tom...
- I love the way you work.

15:38.252 --> 15:39.310
You know who I'm talking to.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.454
There's no way I'm going.
No chance!

15:42.990 --> 15:44.480
No! You guys, no! Hey.

15:44.692 --> 15:45.750
Let go of me!

15:45.960 --> 15:47.052
Hey! No, no.

15:47.261 --> 15:48.888
No!

15:51.098 --> 15:52.429
I hate you guys.

15:52.633 --> 15:54.658
Oh, we hate you too,
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.

15:54.869 --> 15:56.837
Hey! Hey! I agreed to come.
You said I could drive.

15:57.038 --> 15:58.835
We drive by my rules.
No kissing me.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.804
I can't believe that Billy kept the Duke
in running shape all these years.

16:02.009 --> 16:03.943
318 V8, man. They're bulletproof.

16:04.145 --> 16:06.079
How about a little
Fort Cooper classic.

16:07.615 --> 16:09.879
<i>This is Rocking Billy Newwood.
I'm here with fellow DJs</i>

16:10.084 --> 16:12.018
<i>- Jazzy Jerry.
- Yeah!</i>

16:12.220 --> 16:14.745
<i>- Gonzo Tommy.
- Yeah!</i>

16:14.956 --> 16:17.618
<i>- And Disco Dan.
- Burn, baby, burn!</i>

16:17.825 --> 16:20.760
<i>And we have a special dedication
by Dan's mom, entitled:</i>

16:20.962 --> 16:22.953
<i>"I've Had Sex With Tom. "</i>

16:23.164 --> 16:24.631
I totally did, though.

16:32.807 --> 16:36.140
<i>- Usually it's too late when you
- Do you know the words?</i>

16:36.344 --> 16:38.642
<i>Realize what you had</i>

16:39.981 --> 16:45.544
<i>And my mind goes back to a girl
I left some years ago</i>

16:45.753 --> 16:47.050
<i>Who told me</i>

16:47.488 --> 16:50.355
<i>Just hold on loosely</i>

16:51.058 --> 16:54.323
<i>But don't let go</i>

16:54.529 --> 16:58.465
The boys together, the open road.
Good tunes, good times.

16:58.666 --> 17:00.998
Good God! Let's pull off
memory highway.

17:01.202 --> 17:03.261
<i>But I'm never off, always on
To the break of dawn</i>

17:03.471 --> 17:04.529
<i>C- O-M-P-T-O-N</i>

17:04.739 --> 17:06.400
<i>And the city they call Long Beach</i>

17:06.607 --> 17:08.040
<i>Putting the shit together</i>

17:08.242 --> 17:10.107
<i>If it's good enough to take
Them off a proper chunk</i>

17:10.310 --> 17:12.404
<i>I'll take a small piece
Of some of that funky stuff</i>

17:12.613 --> 17:14.410
<i>It's like this and like that
And like this and...</i>

17:14.615 --> 17:17.516
- How do you know all these words?
- He's a doctor.

17:17.718 --> 17:20.209
Doctors study other doctors' work.

17:20.755 --> 17:22.689
- You're a secret Dr. Dre fan.
- Oh, God.

17:22.890 --> 17:24.585
<i>It's like this and like that
And like this...</i>

17:32.233 --> 17:36.067
- No, this is a metropolis. Look at this.
- This place is very remote.

17:36.270 --> 17:39.569
I wish I would've brought my dancing
shoes so we can go clubbing.

17:39.774 --> 17:42.402
- Let's find the nearest hospital.
- Stay at The Ritz. This is great.

17:47.048 --> 17:49.016
- How are you?
- Hi.

17:57.792 --> 17:58.759
Where are we?

17:58.960 --> 18:03.158
Corner of Bumfuck and
You Got a Purty Mouth.

18:03.531 --> 18:05.089
Hey, I'm gonna make a call.

18:05.299 --> 18:07.824
Oh, wait, Jerry, you should use
my new cell phone.

18:08.035 --> 18:10.162
It's a satellite phone,
so it works everywhere.

18:10.371 --> 18:12.931
And it's got a camera and it's got
an address book and, listen,

18:13.140 --> 18:15.040
it's even got a personalized ring.

18:15.242 --> 18:18.143
Nice. You shouldn't be proud
of that, Dan.

18:18.346 --> 18:19.313
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

18:19.513 --> 18:20.878
Well,

18:21.082 --> 18:23.880
I'm gonna go check out
the canoe situation.

18:24.085 --> 18:26.986
- You want anything?
- Good luck. No, I'm good.

18:28.856 --> 18:30.050
Hello?

18:30.257 --> 18:32.487
Denise. What are you doing home?
Hey.

18:32.693 --> 18:34.854
Hi. Is everything all right?

18:35.329 --> 18:36.626
You know...

18:36.831 --> 18:39.459
- It's as good as it can be.
- Where are you?

18:41.202 --> 18:42.499
On the road.

18:42.937 --> 18:45.030
<i>Good. You're on your way home.
What time do you get in?</i>

18:45.239 --> 18:46.433
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

18:46.641 --> 18:47.733
What you looking at, boy?

18:48.843 --> 18:50.572
Here's the thing, the guys and I...

18:50.778 --> 18:52.575
We're going on a treasure hunt.

18:52.780 --> 18:56.477
And I know that sounds dumb,
but it's something that we have to do.

18:56.684 --> 18:57.844
For Billy.

18:58.052 --> 19:01.078
That doesn't sound dumb at all.
I completely understand.

19:01.288 --> 19:04.052
- You do?
- Just call me when you get a chance.

19:04.258 --> 19:07.352
But I might be out of the house.
For a bit. Yeah, because

19:07.561 --> 19:10.997
my girlfriends and I, we're gonna go on
a search for the lost city of Atlantis.

19:11.198 --> 19:13.496
Maybe my treasure will help
buy your submarine.

19:13.701 --> 19:15.760
<i>- Maybe. Maybe it will.
- Take a picture.</i>

19:15.970 --> 19:17.528
- Hold on.
- I'm on the little guy's back.

19:17.738 --> 19:19.330
- Shut up.
- Go, take a picture.

19:19.907 --> 19:20.999
That's good. That's good.

19:23.044 --> 19:24.477
Hello?

19:26.881 --> 19:28.872
That did not sound like it went well.

19:29.817 --> 19:31.876
Hiya, boys. Nice day.

19:32.887 --> 19:34.855
Just passing through?

19:35.556 --> 19:36.887
No.

19:37.091 --> 19:38.683
We're actually from UPS.

19:39.126 --> 19:41.287
Looks like someone ordered
a set of teeth.

19:41.929 --> 19:45.558
- I beg your pardon.
- TASER guns. Dropping them off.

19:47.568 --> 19:49.229
- Anyways...
- So help me out here, boys.

19:49.437 --> 19:51.029
Where was it you said
you was headed?

19:51.238 --> 19:54.036
We're just taking a trip. Our old friend,
Billy, he made this map...

19:54.241 --> 19:56.334
Quiet time. Quiet.

19:56.544 --> 19:58.205
We're just taking a day trip

19:58.412 --> 20:01.074
up Spirit River, Your Honor.

20:01.282 --> 20:02.977
Pretty thick country up there.

20:03.184 --> 20:05.584
You make a couple mistakes up there,
you're gone.

20:05.786 --> 20:08.050
You know what, I think we'll be okay.
I was a Boy Scout.

20:08.255 --> 20:10.189
Tom, you were a Boy Scout,
weren't you?

20:10.391 --> 20:12.859
No. But I ate a Brownie once.

20:14.895 --> 20:17.659
You don't wanna play
on the big river, boys.

20:17.865 --> 20:20.834
- Oh, no, we're not playing, we're...
- I got this. You listen to me.

20:21.302 --> 20:23.167
I know a thing or two
about rapid-riding

20:23.370 --> 20:26.339
because I was a white-water guide
in Northern California, NoCal.

20:26.540 --> 20:30.169
Here's the thing. I know how to read a
river better than you can read a book.

20:30.377 --> 20:32.106
- Just a little better.
- All right.

20:32.313 --> 20:35.407
- All right. So we're gonna get going?
- That's right.

20:35.616 --> 20:38.517
- Thank you, sheriff.
- See you, Ray-Bans.

20:53.734 --> 20:56.168
You think we got enough booze,
Tom?

20:56.370 --> 20:59.271
Maybe you wanna hire a bartender
to come on the trip with us.

20:59.473 --> 21:02.135
What's a camping trip without beer?

21:02.343 --> 21:05.437
Well, it's still a camping trip, actually,
just with less vomiting.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.609
I hear you're a river guide.

21:07.815 --> 21:09.612
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

21:09.817 --> 21:11.375
Class IV, V?

21:13.521 --> 21:15.045
- Which is it?
- Why don't you try putting

21:15.256 --> 21:17.281
those numbers together. That's right.

21:17.491 --> 21:20.483
I've shot a class 45,
and I've never lost a man.

21:20.694 --> 21:23.527
Lie to me. I don't care.

21:23.731 --> 21:25.323
I'm not the one that's going to drown.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.433
All right, fellas.

21:27.635 --> 21:29.694
Here we go. Attention.

21:29.904 --> 21:31.565
We christen you

21:31.772 --> 21:33.296
"Duke II."

21:36.177 --> 21:38.407
Thanks for breaking glass
where my kids play.

21:42.383 --> 21:44.317
There's a transmitter in the canoe.

21:44.518 --> 21:47.578
That way, if you guys disappear,
at least we'll get our boat back.

21:48.055 --> 21:50.649
It's child's play, guy. We got it.

21:51.058 --> 21:53.117
- It's beautiful!
- This is the best.

21:53.327 --> 21:55.386
- I like it out here.
- This is Spirit River!

21:55.596 --> 21:57.564
Get you out of the doctor's office,
Dano.

21:57.765 --> 21:58.993
- It's good to be outside.
- Yeah.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.031
Get you away from
that computer, Jer!

22:08.676 --> 22:10.576
- What kind of fish are those?
- That's brown trout.

22:10.778 --> 22:12.939
- That's big.
- Brown trout?

22:16.517 --> 22:18.712
- Hey, look, a deer!
- It's cool.

22:20.521 --> 22:21.613
Right out there in the open.

22:25.759 --> 22:27.056
Hey...

22:44.578 --> 22:45.977
Cheers.

22:47.214 --> 22:48.408
The great outdoors!

22:48.616 --> 22:50.015
Tom!

22:50.217 --> 22:51.980
- You guys are spraying me!
- Give me a break,

22:52.186 --> 22:54.984
- I'm writing your name!
- Stop it!

22:57.558 --> 22:59.958
- Hey, don't, don't, don't!
- What, are you gonna melt?

23:00.160 --> 23:02.424
No, but this water is teeming
with microbes.

23:07.701 --> 23:10.329
They don't bring losers
to the swag pot!

23:17.678 --> 23:20.408
So this is Spirit River.
We take that to Widowmaker Bend.

23:20.614 --> 23:22.411
And then we hike
the Devil's Staircase,

23:22.616 --> 23:24.584
and that should lead us
to the top of Hellfire Ridge.

23:24.785 --> 23:28.687
What's with all these satanic names?
Isn't there, like, a Fluffy Bunny Way?

23:28.889 --> 23:31.289
No, but there's
a Shut-Up-You-Big-Baby Ridge.

23:31.492 --> 23:32.959
Okay, just keep your eyes open

23:33.160 --> 23:35.355
- for our first day's marker.
- What's that?

23:35.562 --> 23:38.554
It's a rock formation called
Grandpa's Nose.

23:38.766 --> 23:40.256
Grandpa's Nose.

23:40.467 --> 23:42.603
Looking for Grandpa's Nose.

23:43.570 --> 23:46.130
I think I see it! It's right there.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.297
Good work, Dan.

23:48.508 --> 23:51.170
Prepare to port.
I'm gonna drink some beer!

23:51.378 --> 23:54.472
I predict you'll be puking in that river
before the end of the night, Tom.

23:55.515 --> 23:56.982
Dry timber...

24:00.721 --> 24:03.918
Hi there, coalminer's daughter.
You want a hand?

24:04.124 --> 24:06.991
Or you can always try these fancy
new things called "matches. "

24:07.194 --> 24:08.991
I saw how to do this on
the Discovery Channel.

24:09.196 --> 24:11.323
Okay? And I'm gonna do it.
I got it covered.

24:11.765 --> 24:13.392
Oxygen in there...

24:13.600 --> 24:16.467
Get that right combination...

24:24.444 --> 24:26.708
Stop, drop and roll!

24:29.783 --> 24:30.750
Why would you do that?!

24:30.951 --> 24:33.579
I'm with my face right next to the...
And you blow...

24:33.787 --> 24:36.187
- Why would you do that?!
- It's warm.

24:36.390 --> 24:38.017
It's a nice fire.

24:38.625 --> 24:39.990
Hey.

24:40.661 --> 24:42.219
We did it.

24:42.429 --> 24:44.397
I told you.

24:46.867 --> 24:50.928
<i>Do you really wanna hurt me?</i>

24:51.138 --> 24:54.972
<i>Do you really wanna hear this crap?</i>

24:55.175 --> 24:57.541
Please. You liked this song
just as much as I did.

24:57.744 --> 25:00.178
When we were kids,
it didn't matter what the song was.

25:00.380 --> 25:03.110
We weren't wrapped up
in what was cool and uncool.

25:03.316 --> 25:05.113
We just listened to the music.

25:05.318 --> 25:07.946
It should be like that now.
Just listen to the song, man.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.728
This song is so uncool.

25:16.063 --> 25:20.227
- Well, I like it. It soothes me.
- Dan, what is wrong with you?

25:21.535 --> 25:23.127
I'm blessed with good taste.

25:23.336 --> 25:25.497
One day, you'll see,
I've always been correct.

25:25.706 --> 25:30.234
Don't get cocky, 30-year-old Dr. Mott,
with 46 years of school under his belt.

25:30.444 --> 25:33.572
Excuse me for getting an MD
and starting a successful practice.

25:33.780 --> 25:37.375
Excuse me. I found a way to make 12
grand a month without having an MD.

25:37.584 --> 25:39.575
Really? How do you do that?

25:39.786 --> 25:42.016
You running immigrants
over the border again, coyote?

25:42.222 --> 25:44.190
Those guys fell asleep in my truck.

25:44.391 --> 25:48.054
I thought I'd just gotten shitfaced
and bought a bunch of sombreros.

25:48.261 --> 25:50.889
I didn't know there were dudes
underneath.

25:51.531 --> 25:52.964
For real, though?

25:53.166 --> 25:54.758
Selling Harleys.

25:55.168 --> 25:57.659
It's the greatest gig on the planet.

25:58.138 --> 25:59.400
Congrats. I'm happy for you.

26:00.307 --> 26:01.672
Seriously, though,
you guys both sound

26:01.875 --> 26:04.275
- like you're doing great.
- Aren't you?

26:04.478 --> 26:08.175
I just don't know if I'm cut out for
the whole family-wife-kids thing.

26:08.381 --> 26:12.477
I would kill to have a woman at home
willing to have sex with me every night.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.848
At work, I just sit in my office
and I think,

26:17.057 --> 26:19.548
"There's gotta be something better
out there. " You know what I mean?

26:19.760 --> 26:22.786
- I thought you liked your job.
- I like to surf.

26:22.996 --> 26:25.521
Sitting out in the water.

26:26.133 --> 26:28.829
Waiting for that perfect wave.

26:31.271 --> 26:34.866
And I also like being out here.
I like this, right now.

26:35.242 --> 26:39.546
The first time in months,
no worries, no responsibilities.

26:39.612 --> 26:41.705
Just living in the moment.

26:42.815 --> 26:45.113
Just like Billy did.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.476
Hey.

26:47.687 --> 26:48.881
Here's to Billy.

26:49.088 --> 26:50.555
- To our dead friend.
- Get them up.

26:50.757 --> 26:52.224
Tom...

26:54.327 --> 26:57.854
Dano, whatever happened between
you and Cockeyed Katie, anyway?

26:58.064 --> 27:01.295
You know, I don't appreciate the
name-calling. Katie was very attractive.

27:01.501 --> 27:03.332
It was a mutual separation.

27:03.536 --> 27:05.367
Yeah, between her eyes.

27:05.572 --> 27:08.234
That girl had not one,
but two wandering eyes.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.105
It was like her eyes were trying
to escape from her head.

27:11.611 --> 27:14.375
You know, Tom, I'm sorry she wasn't
up to your high standard of women.

27:14.581 --> 27:16.981
No tattoos below the waist,
never worked as a carny.

27:17.183 --> 27:19.481
Name one girlfriend of mine
who worked as a carny.

27:19.686 --> 27:22.587
Jo Jo, the one who had
her downstairs pierced.

27:22.789 --> 27:24.416
Oh, Jo Jo. That's one.

27:24.624 --> 27:26.649
How do you know what she did
with her downstairs?

27:26.859 --> 27:27.883
She had that website:

27:28.094 --> 27:31.188
- JoJosDownstairs.com.
- That was a good one.

27:31.397 --> 27:33.331
Hey, Dano, let's see what
you packed us for dinner.

27:33.533 --> 27:36.468
- What is this, astronaut food?
- No. It's a vitamin gel pack.

27:36.669 --> 27:39.638
It tastes like watermelon. It's very filling
and it preserves well for camping.

27:39.839 --> 27:42.171
I'm not an astronaut.
I'm an American.

27:42.609 --> 27:45.407
And there's fresh salmon
in that river for the taking.

27:45.912 --> 27:47.311
What?

27:47.513 --> 27:49.481
I'm eating salmon tonight.

27:49.682 --> 27:51.809
That's great, except
we didn't bring any fishing gear.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.144
Don't need any.

27:54.954 --> 27:57.923
- We'll shine them.
- That would kill a fish.

27:58.124 --> 28:01.150
Shine the fish, old Cherokee trick.

28:01.361 --> 28:05.388
I forgot the Cherokee had been using
the flashlight for thousands of years.

28:05.598 --> 28:07.623
No, didn't they pioneer the D battery?

28:07.834 --> 28:08.960
All right, suckers.

28:09.168 --> 28:12.763
Let's see who's eating salmon tonight
and who's eating crow.

28:12.972 --> 28:16.499
- Do you have a crow-catching trick?
- Yuk it up, astronauts.

28:16.709 --> 28:18.768
They love figure eights.

28:18.978 --> 28:21.139
Hey, 100 grand
and my left nut says

28:21.347 --> 28:23.679
the only thing you catch
out there is a cold.

28:23.883 --> 28:26.181
Got it! Grab it!

28:27.253 --> 28:29.050
What are you doing?!

28:29.722 --> 28:31.713
- Fantastic.
- Can you do that again?

28:31.924 --> 28:34.552
You owe me 100 grand
and the left nut.

28:34.761 --> 28:36.319
Are you gonna catch it
when I throw it up?

28:36.529 --> 28:38.463
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, come on!

28:38.665 --> 28:42.999
I'm gonna have to use a distinct pattern
now. They got used to the figure eight.

28:44.237 --> 28:47.331
It's gonna be tough, but I'll focus.

28:48.441 --> 28:49.908
What the hell are you doing?

28:50.209 --> 28:52.803
I toss it, you grab it.
That's your part of the deal.

28:54.947 --> 28:56.471
What?

28:59.552 --> 29:01.713
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking off my shoes.

29:01.921 --> 29:04.685
- Why?
- Because I run faster with no shoes.

29:04.891 --> 29:07.860
- You can't outrun that bear.
- I don't have to outrun the bear.

29:08.061 --> 29:09.995
I just have to outrun you.

29:10.196 --> 29:11.390
Stay calm.

29:11.597 --> 29:14.532
It's important that you don't
let them smell your fear.

29:14.734 --> 29:17.760
- Just follow my lead.
- What are you gonna do?

29:20.039 --> 29:22.701
It's a bear! We're all gonna die!

29:23.276 --> 29:24.868
Run!

29:30.683 --> 29:31.672
Keep going!

29:44.731 --> 29:46.130
Get out!

29:46.332 --> 29:47.526
- Go away! Go!
- Get out!

29:52.505 --> 29:55.804
- Stay calm. Get in the fetal position.
- Oh, God.

29:56.008 --> 29:58.943
It won't bother you
if you're in the fetal position.

30:05.284 --> 30:08.776
- Nothing's gonna happen now.
- Is he gone? Is he gone?

30:08.988 --> 30:11.081
Abort the fetal position!
It's not working!

30:11.290 --> 30:12.314
- It's not working!
- Run!

30:12.525 --> 30:14.288
No...

30:17.497 --> 30:19.124
The bear thinks Dan's her cub.

30:28.674 --> 30:30.073
What do we do now?

30:36.215 --> 30:39.981
Stay... Stay down.
Don't make eye contact.

30:41.921 --> 30:43.912
- Help me!
- Let's go.

30:44.123 --> 30:46.250
This is bad. This is really bad.
Do something.

30:46.459 --> 30:48.791
- Go first.
- No, you go first.

30:54.934 --> 30:57.425
Hey. Where's the bear?

31:11.450 --> 31:14.544
He's trying to fatten Dan up
so they can hibernate together.

31:22.495 --> 31:25.794
Chew it up and eat it.

31:25.998 --> 31:27.522
Eat it.

31:36.809 --> 31:39.141
- Stop pretending.
- Dan, you have to eat it.

31:39.345 --> 31:41.472
You have to actually eat it.

31:41.681 --> 31:44.081
- Okay.
- Bite.

31:45.818 --> 31:47.410
Eat it.

32:00.867 --> 32:03.427
It's delicious. Very good, thank you.

32:03.636 --> 32:05.729
Is there another one?

32:08.174 --> 32:11.632
That was good. That was real good.

32:14.347 --> 32:16.406
- Let's go.
- Okay.

32:20.553 --> 32:22.612
- Move, move, move.
- Up the tree.

32:29.295 --> 32:32.230
- Your mom misses you.
- She's in my stuff.

32:32.932 --> 32:37.301
Hey, that's my phone.
She ate my phone.

32:37.737 --> 32:40.535
How long do you think
she'll keep looking for me?

32:40.740 --> 32:42.867
Hour, hour and a half, tops.

32:43.209 --> 32:46.804
Bears have very short attention spans.
I know a guy who trains them.

33:04.530 --> 33:06.122
What was that?

33:07.967 --> 33:11.664
I don't know, but it scared away
our friend. Let's get out of here.

33:13.506 --> 33:16.066
What do you think could happen
if this thing went off right in the boat?

33:16.275 --> 33:18.243
- You think we'd die?
- I think you throw it right now.

33:18.577 --> 33:20.340
What if I toss it to you
and then you throw it?

33:20.546 --> 33:22.639
Elwood, throw it!

33:25.751 --> 33:28.379
- Cue the insane hillbillies.
- What are these freaks doing?

33:28.587 --> 33:29.781
They're fishing.

33:29.989 --> 33:32.617
Why aren't they using
their flashlights, Tom?

33:33.859 --> 33:36.726
This is exactly what you hear about
when people go into the deep woods

33:36.929 --> 33:38.590
in the middle of summertime.
Aside from getting all sorts

33:38.798 --> 33:40.823
of diseases and things,
they just wind up being the victims

33:41.033 --> 33:42.432
of some kind of
unexpected man-rape.

33:42.635 --> 33:44.830
How you like me now, boy?

33:45.037 --> 33:48.438
- I don't like this...
- Quiet. Go, go.

33:49.542 --> 33:50.770
She ate everything.

33:50.977 --> 33:52.740
Including my very expensive
cell phone.

33:52.945 --> 33:56.142
All right, let's load up.
There's treasure in them hills.

33:56.349 --> 33:58.783
Wait a minute, you're not actually
considering continuing, are you?

33:58.985 --> 34:00.612
- Why not?
- Well, because I just...

34:00.820 --> 34:04.415
I got carried away by a bear. And then
we spent the night sleeping in a tree.

34:04.623 --> 34:06.716
Well, we got that out of the way.

34:06.926 --> 34:08.223
Now we can get back on the river.

34:08.427 --> 34:10.793
There comes a time
in every cub's life

34:10.996 --> 34:13.487
when he needs to strike out
and make it on his own.

34:13.766 --> 34:14.733
Fine.

34:14.934 --> 34:18.563
Fine. But I say we avoid them and we
launch around the bend there, okay?

34:18.771 --> 34:22.172
All right, all right. Heave-ho.

34:22.808 --> 34:26.471
They call this portage. Or portage.

34:27.045 --> 34:30.038
- What's the map say, Jerry?
- You know, it's a map.

34:30.815 --> 34:33.649
It's gonna be... It's gonna be good.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.650
Jer, isn't the river supposed to fork?

34:36.856 --> 34:39.848
No. It just goes straight
the whole way. Straight shot.

34:40.458 --> 34:41.687
Are you sure?

34:41.893 --> 34:44.726
We are back in business, boys.

34:46.966 --> 34:49.366
All right. Let's rudder back.

34:49.768 --> 34:50.860
Bring the tail out.

34:53.973 --> 34:57.841
- It's getting kind of rough, Tom.
- Not bad, I've been in much worse.

34:58.944 --> 35:00.502
Really?

35:00.713 --> 35:02.840
Not a good time to read a map, Jer.

35:03.582 --> 35:06.881
Guys, I wanna pull over. I need
to take some Dramamine...

35:07.086 --> 35:09.350
I got the stern. Work the bow,
work the bow, Jer.

35:09.822 --> 35:12.017
Guys, let's pull over.

35:12.324 --> 35:14.952
This is exactly what you'd expect.
We're doing great.

35:15.394 --> 35:17.589
Tom, guide us to the bank.

35:17.897 --> 35:20.730
- Watch the current.
- Trees! Trees left!

35:25.805 --> 35:27.898
No problem.
That's typical river behavior.

35:28.107 --> 35:31.270
Rocks! Rocks! Keep rowing!

35:31.477 --> 35:33.274
I'm not having the fun
you promised me!

35:33.479 --> 35:35.344
Just keep rowing!

35:40.352 --> 35:42.047
- Follow my lead!
- Terrible!

35:42.254 --> 35:43.744
Same stroke, same stroke!

35:44.190 --> 35:45.623
- Tom?
- Yes?

35:45.825 --> 35:47.918
- It's getting big.
- No problem.

35:48.127 --> 35:49.560
Like, real big.

35:51.597 --> 35:53.394
- I'm in over my head!
- What?!

35:53.599 --> 35:55.499
- Don't tell me that!
- I'm in over my head!

35:55.801 --> 35:57.029
Please don't tell me that!

35:57.236 --> 36:00.239
Forward! No, backstroke,
backstroke!

36:01.707 --> 36:03.572
Come on!

36:12.384 --> 36:13.715
Dano!

36:13.919 --> 36:14.943
Tom!

36:16.321 --> 36:17.583
Help!

36:20.959 --> 36:24.451
Jerry! Help!

36:26.064 --> 36:27.861
- Dan! I'm coming!
- Can you see me?

36:28.066 --> 36:30.159
- Dan!
- Jerry!

36:30.736 --> 36:32.897
- Dano!
- Throw it! Jer!

36:33.105 --> 36:34.868
Catch the rope!

36:36.108 --> 36:37.598
I got you!

36:44.249 --> 36:46.581
- Dan, come on, baby, I got you.
- Hypothermia!

36:46.818 --> 36:49.048
- I'm gonna get hypothermia!
- Come on!

36:50.756 --> 36:53.589
You all right? Hold on.

36:53.792 --> 36:56.420
- Tom! Tommy!
- Tom!

36:56.628 --> 36:57.890
In here, boys!

37:03.068 --> 37:04.899
We made it!

37:05.604 --> 37:07.765
That's how you go down the rapids!

37:07.973 --> 37:09.702
- Better get in.
- Get up.

37:12.844 --> 37:16.007
- I about shit. Did you about shit?
- I about shit.

37:16.214 --> 37:18.114
- I did shit.
- Oh, shit.

37:18.317 --> 37:19.944
- Oh, shit? What "oh, shit"?
- What? What, what?

37:21.053 --> 37:29.620
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

37:35.167 --> 37:37.192
I don't believe this, man.

37:41.073 --> 37:42.301
Tom...

37:42.607 --> 37:45.337
- Where were you a river guide?
- San Dimas.

37:45.577 --> 37:47.704
- Raging Waters?
- Yeah.

37:47.913 --> 37:49.471
They had some serious
rapids there, man.

37:49.681 --> 37:52.514
- What, class "toddler"?
- Hey, I was employee of the month

37:52.718 --> 37:54.049
at the Monsoon Lagoon.

37:54.252 --> 37:55.810
- I knew you were lying.
- Great.

37:56.021 --> 37:57.318
- Oh, you did?
- I knew it.

37:57.522 --> 38:00.150
Well, you're the reason
that we had to launch the boat

38:00.359 --> 38:01.485
in the wrong part of the river.

38:01.693 --> 38:03.524
Hey, I am not
the navigator-map guy.

38:03.762 --> 38:06.629
Okay, Jerry, didn't you see
on the map that the river split?

38:06.965 --> 38:10.833
I would've, if your friend,
the big-ass bear, didn't eat the map.

38:11.036 --> 38:12.867
Hold on a sec. Tom?

38:13.071 --> 38:14.698
Were you really
employee of the month?

38:14.906 --> 38:17.704
No. I lied about that too.

38:18.243 --> 38:20.677
I must have been crazy. I...

38:21.012 --> 38:24.470
All right. This trip is officially over.
This is finished! Let's...

38:24.816 --> 38:28.013
- Let's just go home.
- I agree. That's a great decision.

38:28.220 --> 38:31.246
All we gotta do is jump up over
that 100-foot waterfall,

38:31.456 --> 38:34.118
swim upstream 20 miles,
get the sheriff on the phone...

38:34.326 --> 38:37.022
He liked us, I remember. And he'll
send out a rescue boat. And...

38:37.229 --> 38:40.221
Hey, there's a beer in the river. Cool.

38:40.465 --> 38:42.592
Look at this, it's cold.

38:43.702 --> 38:46.262
We are in serious trouble, my friends.

38:46.772 --> 38:49.366
All data points to us being...
How do you humans say it?

38:49.574 --> 38:50.836
Completely screwed?

38:51.042 --> 38:53.875
Yeah. You know, that is...
That's a good way to say it.

38:54.079 --> 38:55.740
I mean, it pretty much sums it up.

38:55.947 --> 38:58.711
I suspect Tom is drunk.
I didn't wanna say anything,

38:58.917 --> 38:59.941
- because he's such a live wire...
- You guys, we're fine.

39:00.152 --> 39:02.643
We got the compass.
I've got Billy's compass!

39:02.854 --> 39:05.516
Look, that's east, west, north.

39:06.124 --> 39:07.887
- That's south.
- That's south! That's south!

39:08.093 --> 39:09.788
That's great!

39:10.262 --> 39:11.854
- What?
- Sorry.

39:12.063 --> 39:13.928
It only works with the map.

39:14.166 --> 39:16.430
So you're saying you lost the map?
You don't have it?

39:16.635 --> 39:19.160
No. I'm saying I forgot
to hold on to it while my ass

39:19.371 --> 39:21.498
was free-falling
over a 100-foot waterfall.

39:21.706 --> 39:23.571
So you don't have it?

39:25.177 --> 39:27.145
Hey, do you hear that?

39:27.746 --> 39:30.874
- Oh, hell, yeah.
- Hey, that sounds like Creed.

39:31.082 --> 39:35.178
I never thought I'd be happy to hear
anything that sounds like Creed.

39:38.790 --> 39:40.348
Lights.

39:43.094 --> 39:45.562
Thank you, God. Civilization.

39:45.764 --> 39:47.231
- Look at that.
- They have a fire.

39:47.432 --> 39:51.664
- You think they're cooking food?
- I hope so. I am starving.

39:56.241 --> 39:59.176
- Damn it, Elwood. This blade is dull.
- Ain't my fault.

40:01.646 --> 40:03.273
- See how I popped off that fish head?
- What is it?

40:03.482 --> 40:05.507
I told you not to use my buck knife.

40:05.717 --> 40:07.810
How you like me now, fish?

40:08.019 --> 40:10.180
You ain't so tough
without a head, huh?

40:11.223 --> 40:13.453
Oh, what's that? You can't hear me?

40:13.859 --> 40:15.292
That's right, because
you don't have ears,

40:15.494 --> 40:17.758
because you don't have a head,
because I cut it off!

40:19.998 --> 40:22.523
Okay, that's... I mean,
that's a little weird, right?

40:22.734 --> 40:23.701
We should get out of here.

40:24.536 --> 40:26.197
Listen, I say we just try talking...

40:27.138 --> 40:28.298
Shut it.

40:29.341 --> 40:31.275
The hell was that?

40:33.945 --> 40:35.242
- Is that a gun?
- That's a gun.

40:50.962 --> 40:52.896
Must've been a possum.

40:53.098 --> 40:55.566
Boll weevil.

40:55.767 --> 40:59.635
- Guns and fish heads...
- It's okay, Dano, relax.

40:59.838 --> 41:02.739
We'll just lay low.
We'll get out of here in a second.

41:03.642 --> 41:05.007
- Hey.
- Yeah?

41:05.210 --> 41:09.306
- These guys are pot farmers.
- What? How do you know that?

41:15.153 --> 41:17.917
Oh, boy. We should go.

41:19.958 --> 41:22.017
Lynyrd. Skynyrd. Come here.

41:27.766 --> 41:29.859
There you go, spoiling them dogs.

41:30.068 --> 41:31.831
Lots of vitamins in these fish heads.

41:33.505 --> 41:37.271
Look at that. Skynyrd likes fish heads
almost as much as you do.

41:37.475 --> 41:39.102
Do you think they saw us?

41:39.311 --> 41:41.438
No, I don't.

41:45.884 --> 41:47.613
- What are you doing?
- What?

41:47.819 --> 41:49.480
I'll write you a prescription. Let's go.

41:49.688 --> 41:51.815
- Come on.
- All right.

42:00.765 --> 42:02.562
On my go. Ready?

42:08.440 --> 42:10.340
Go, go, back here. Come on.

42:14.179 --> 42:16.147
Hey, guys.

42:16.348 --> 42:17.610
Listen. We don't want any trouble.

42:18.083 --> 42:21.416
We just got lost on the river,
you know?

42:21.620 --> 42:22.951
Hey, can we use your phone?

42:23.288 --> 42:24.482
Oh, of course.

42:24.689 --> 42:26.623
And... Who cares, you know?

42:33.398 --> 42:37.300
- Let's go through there.
- Where? There's no door.

42:40.872 --> 42:43.602
- Lynyrd, Skynyrd. Get them.
- Come on, Dano.

42:45.510 --> 42:47.068
- Good work, buddy.
- Thanks.

42:47.512 --> 42:49.810
- Let's go.
- Come on, Dano.

42:50.782 --> 42:51.874
Come on!

42:52.450 --> 42:54.350
Go, go, go!

43:00.458 --> 43:02.119
What did you do?

43:03.028 --> 43:05.155
Why are there flares?

43:06.264 --> 43:09.290
Great mother of ganja.

43:09.501 --> 43:11.435
Come on! I see them! I got them!

43:11.636 --> 43:14.298
- Hey, boys, come back here.
- We ain't gonna hurt you boys!

43:14.506 --> 43:17.373
- Just wanna talk to you.
- There they are. Right there.

43:18.309 --> 43:21.278
Damn it, you head to the left.
I'll cut them off.

43:22.681 --> 43:24.615
- Go, go, go!
- They're shooting!

43:25.684 --> 43:28.016
I think I got them, Dennis!

43:28.586 --> 43:30.053
They're shooting at us! Run!

43:30.889 --> 43:33.653
Come on, Dennis, I'm gonna get them!

43:42.333 --> 43:44.597
Damn it! I can't see nothing
through this smoke!

43:44.836 --> 43:47.634
- We're dead. We're dead.
- We're dead.

43:48.973 --> 43:52.841
- We're dead!
- They're gonna... They're gonna...

43:57.015 --> 43:58.209
We're gonna die...

44:00.351 --> 44:03.081
You set the security flares
too close, Elwood.

44:03.288 --> 44:05.222
The whole damn field's on fire.

44:05.423 --> 44:08.415
Where the hell are the damn dogs?!

44:11.162 --> 44:13.528
You guys gotta promise me that you'll
never tell my patients that I got stoned,

44:13.732 --> 44:16.326
because if they found out I got stoned,
they'll think that I'm a stoner.

44:16.534 --> 44:18.331
The next thing you know,
I won't have a license anymore.

44:18.536 --> 44:21.471
They'll take away all my instruments
and my coat and my office,

44:21.673 --> 44:23.436
and I won't have
a parking space anymore.

44:23.641 --> 44:26.906
I just don't wanna lose all my stuff.
I lost my legs...

44:32.984 --> 44:35.748
Oh, great. We got us
a couple of weed freaks.

44:36.387 --> 44:38.651
The hell are they looking at?

44:39.557 --> 44:41.286
Get up, you stoner dogs!

44:43.595 --> 44:47.725
Get up. You gotta move
your legs. Move your legs.

44:48.500 --> 44:50.229
I think I see them.

44:50.735 --> 44:53.203
They got laser scopes.
They had you pinned.

44:53.705 --> 44:55.263
Dudes.

44:55.473 --> 44:58.806
Dudes, dudes. Seriously. Seriously.

44:59.010 --> 45:03.538
I will give you four cows
for Denise's hand in marriage.

45:05.917 --> 45:08.078
I'll give them something
to laugh about.

45:22.100 --> 45:23.590
<i>Matrix.</i>

45:26.204 --> 45:28.001
My back.

45:28.206 --> 45:29.730
Cut them off at the river.

45:29.941 --> 45:31.909
Jerry, Jerry.

45:33.044 --> 45:36.207
Billy. Jesus, Billy.

45:36.414 --> 45:39.349
- I miss you.
- You gonna find D.B.'s treasure?

45:39.551 --> 45:41.451
I'm just trying to make it out
of here alive.

45:41.653 --> 45:45.419
Don't give up. Keep looking.
Hey, is it cool to be a grown-up?

45:45.623 --> 45:46.851
Not really, my man.

45:47.058 --> 45:50.357
Stop. Stop. You're gonna run into...

45:54.799 --> 45:56.323
We can't outrun them.
We gotta hide.

45:56.534 --> 45:58.866
- Quick, hide.
- How? How?

45:59.070 --> 46:00.697
Let's get them!

46:04.042 --> 46:08.035
Man, our whole crop is burning!
Those assholes are dead!

46:08.279 --> 46:10.304
And the bodies that are attached
to them are dead too!

46:10.515 --> 46:12.380
Dead! D-E-A-D! Dead!

46:12.584 --> 46:16.315
- Assholes! A-S-S-H-O...
- Stop spelling!

46:16.521 --> 46:19.115
- Come on, you're dead!
- We're gonna get you!

46:19.324 --> 46:23.317
- You can only run so far!
- And you can never hide!

46:37.942 --> 46:40.809
- Bullfrogs.
- I hate bullfrogs. They're nasty.

46:44.249 --> 46:45.739
Don't waste the ammo.

46:46.317 --> 46:49.480
Come on, they must've headed up
towards the river.

46:57.362 --> 46:59.922
- It crawled straight in my stomach.
- Let's go.

47:00.498 --> 47:03.399
I think it laid eggs in my stomach.

47:11.342 --> 47:12.707
You think they're still following us?

47:12.911 --> 47:15.547
I don't wanna stop and find out.
Just keep going.

47:17.215 --> 47:20.673
It's not all burnt.
I think we're gonna be okay.

47:20.885 --> 47:21.909
- You think?
- Yeah.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.179
- You think?
- Yeah.

47:25.156 --> 47:29.820
Damn it. It's all burnt. I knew it,
Dennis. It's all burnt. Every bit.

47:30.028 --> 47:32.826
- They burned it.
- Oh, yeah. It's all burnt.

47:33.031 --> 47:36.432
The whole damn field is burnt.
But we got a bigger problem, Elwood!

47:36.634 --> 47:39.694
We got three bona fide yuppies
out there,

47:39.904 --> 47:42.429
lost somewhere,
and we gotta track them.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.609
We gotta catch them
and we gotta kill them.

47:46.277 --> 47:50.043
I think we can slow down. I haven't
heard dogs or guns for hours.

47:50.248 --> 47:52.682
Yeah? You slow down, get a stick
of dynamite up your ass.

47:52.884 --> 47:55.853
Calm down, Daniel,
we're gonna be all right.

47:56.054 --> 47:57.385
No, we're not, Jerry.

47:57.922 --> 47:59.480
We could really die out here.

47:59.691 --> 48:01.659
Man, I can't believe
that I would listen to you guys.

48:02.026 --> 48:04.256
"Let's go take Billy's trip.

48:04.462 --> 48:07.056
Let's... Let's find D.B.'s treasure.

48:07.265 --> 48:08.960
I'll get a canoe. I'll get some rope. "

48:09.167 --> 48:10.634
- Is he all right?
- "It'll be great. "

48:11.569 --> 48:14.561
- "We'll find D.B.'s treasure!" Right.
- Is he having a panic attack?

48:14.772 --> 48:15.739
- I don't know.
- That's great.

48:15.940 --> 48:17.532
Make jokes. That's a really good idea.

48:17.942 --> 48:20.001
Is this living in the moment
enough for you, Jerry?

48:20.211 --> 48:22.975
Is this the carefree life with no
responsibility that you wanted?

48:23.181 --> 48:27.140
Is this the...? Is this the great wilderness
adventure that you were dreaming of?

48:27.352 --> 48:30.116
How should I be, Dr. Dan? Tell me.

48:30.321 --> 48:32.448
- Be afraid.
- I am afraid.

48:32.657 --> 48:36.115
Well, then, act like it! It is very
confusing to people in your life

48:36.327 --> 48:38.022
when you don't act the way
that you're feeling!

48:38.262 --> 48:39.854
No wonder Denise
is fed up with you.

48:40.064 --> 48:42.965
- What did you say?
- Don't you step to me.

48:43.167 --> 48:45.567
- Put your hands down.
- You take it easy.

48:45.770 --> 48:50.298
Mr. Joe-Tattoo, Mr. Motorcycle-Man,
Mr. Super-Cool, Mr. Bullet-Wound...

48:51.042 --> 48:54.773
- Oh, my... Tom, you got shot.
- Oh, cool.

48:54.979 --> 48:57.174
- He got shot?
- Yeah. Come here.

48:58.082 --> 48:59.982
- Are you all right?
- You could lose a roll of pennies

49:00.184 --> 49:01.776
in that thing. Look at how deep it is.

49:01.986 --> 49:03.920
It just grazed you. You're really lucky.

49:04.155 --> 49:06.623
Oh, wow, that's gonna be
a great scar.

49:06.824 --> 49:08.660
I'm gonna stitch it up good.

49:25.309 --> 49:26.571
Lose the cleaver.

49:26.778 --> 49:28.769
Meat cleaver's my favorite.

49:28.980 --> 49:31.448
It's scary, but ultimately ineffective.
Lose it.

49:31.649 --> 49:34.516
Now, Dennis, you don't understand...

49:34.719 --> 49:36.880
Them three boys get back to town,

49:37.088 --> 49:40.751
you're gonna spend the next 40 years
in the can getting manhandled.

49:41.059 --> 49:43.050
Quit messing around.

49:43.261 --> 49:44.387
Lose the cleaver.

49:48.032 --> 49:50.125
I love the cleaver.

49:51.235 --> 49:53.601
You'll be good as new. Sorry.

49:55.907 --> 49:57.534
Hey, Dano.

49:58.342 --> 49:59.866
I'm sorry I got you into this.

50:00.244 --> 50:03.111
- I really am.
- Jerry, I wanted to come.

50:03.314 --> 50:06.078
Well, we're getting out of it. I promise.
And when we do,

50:06.284 --> 50:07.717
someone's buying
the first round. Not it.

50:07.919 --> 50:09.944
- Not it.
- Tom, I think you're buying

50:10.154 --> 50:13.851
with all that... All that Harley money.
Oh, God, it's making me sick.

50:14.525 --> 50:16.959
I'm sorry, I...

50:17.462 --> 50:19.054
That whole thing
was an exaggeration.

50:19.263 --> 50:22.721
- What, you don't make that much?
- No, I don't sell Harleys.

50:22.934 --> 50:27.030
In fact, the only thing I've sold lately
is some clothes and CDs.

50:27.238 --> 50:28.762
They weren't even mine.

50:28.973 --> 50:31.601
Tom, that's not an exaggeration,
that's a lie.

50:31.843 --> 50:34.334
- You know, you lie a lot.
- I know.

50:34.912 --> 50:36.470
What happened?

50:36.714 --> 50:40.480
Well, first it was blackjack.
Then the cards went south.

50:40.685 --> 50:43.654
So then I started betting
football and baseball.

50:43.855 --> 50:45.550
I lost everything.

50:45.757 --> 50:48.123
What'd I expect?
I got no luck, Jerry.

50:48.326 --> 50:51.784
It's like my old man used to say,
"Family curse.

50:51.996 --> 50:54.157
If we didn't have bad luck,
we wouldn't have luck at all. "

50:54.365 --> 50:56.492
You have got to stop
blaming your old man.

50:56.701 --> 50:57.793
I'm not blaming anyone.

50:58.002 --> 51:00.027
Yeah, you are. Listen to yourself.
"The family curse. "

51:00.238 --> 51:02.536
Yeah, it's real. I'm a great gambler.

51:02.740 --> 51:04.833
I will give you one thing:
Your dad was a piece of work.

51:05.042 --> 51:07.408
I mean, he had his own things
going on.

51:07.879 --> 51:09.369
But if he did one thing right,

51:09.914 --> 51:12.815
it was not raising a complete idiot.
You're not him, Tommy.

51:13.017 --> 51:15.349
You're a lot smarter, for one thing.

51:16.387 --> 51:17.547
Right, Dano?

51:21.526 --> 51:23.994
Well, I wouldn't say a lot smarter.

51:25.930 --> 51:29.627
Tom, you have a lot more
going for you than you think you do.

51:30.067 --> 51:32.968
That's easy for you to say, Dano.
You're a freaking doctor.

51:33.171 --> 51:36.937
I mean, you got a big old
bank account, a ginormous house,

51:37.141 --> 51:38.733
- big, thick red hair...
- You know what?

51:38.943 --> 51:40.638
I wouldn't be so jealous of me
if I were you.

51:40.845 --> 51:44.337
Every day I develop some
new and exciting phobia.

51:44.549 --> 51:46.380
You're exaggerating again.

51:46.584 --> 51:47.676
I'm afraid of the dark, Jerry.

51:47.885 --> 51:50.217
So? There's a lot of people
that are afraid of the dark.

51:50.421 --> 51:52.355
- I know a shitload.
- I'm afraid of small spaces.

51:52.557 --> 51:54.115
Again, not that abnormal.

51:54.392 --> 51:56.952
- Cellophane.
- Like Saran Wrap?

51:57.161 --> 51:59.186
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're alone on that one.

51:59.397 --> 52:01.763
See, I won't even keep it
in the house anymore,

52:01.966 --> 52:05.197
because I'm afraid somehow it'll get,
like, draped over my head

52:05.403 --> 52:08.895
and stick to my mouth and nose
and I'll... I'll suffocate.

52:09.106 --> 52:11.370
- How pathetic is that?
- Very.

52:15.346 --> 52:17.473
Relax, you're almost through.

52:17.849 --> 52:21.683
There you go. Hey, would one
of you guys grab my? Phone. My...

52:21.886 --> 52:23.376
That's a phone.

52:24.555 --> 52:26.887
- It's that way.
- Phone!

52:27.358 --> 52:28.950
How did your phone
get all the way up here?

52:29.160 --> 52:31.219
- Who cares?
- That last thing I remember, it was...

52:34.365 --> 52:38.392
- Go, go, go!
- That bear loves you, Dano!

52:38.603 --> 52:41.731
Whiskey Dick, this is Lightning
Company. Come in, Whiskey Dick.

52:41.939 --> 52:47.741
We are on the move and loaded
for bear. Come back, come back...

52:48.412 --> 52:51.142
- Why'd you stop?
- Right there.

52:51.349 --> 52:52.748
Footprints.

52:54.919 --> 52:56.284
Oh, it's theirs.

52:57.555 --> 52:59.022
It's weird.

53:00.157 --> 53:03.092
Footprints with no people in them.

53:03.294 --> 53:04.886
I mean...

53:05.329 --> 53:07.559
..it's like it's them,

53:07.765 --> 53:10.029
but it's not them,
you know what I mean?

53:10.234 --> 53:11.792
Rarely.

53:12.036 --> 53:13.765
Get on your wheeler.

53:14.305 --> 53:17.468
Hold on a second, guys.
You know what we should do?

53:17.675 --> 53:19.370
We're gonna climb the tree.

53:19.577 --> 53:23.069
We'll climb the tree, get a good look
at the land, maybe we'll see a road

53:23.281 --> 53:24.373
or a way out of here.

53:24.582 --> 53:27.016
Yeah, I'll go. Give me a boost.

53:27.218 --> 53:29.743
Oh, hey, Tom, wait.
You can use these.

53:29.954 --> 53:31.148
Thanks.

53:31.422 --> 53:33.947
Please, just be careful.

53:35.860 --> 53:38.385
Are you maintaining
a safe distance back there?

53:38.596 --> 53:40.962
Yeah, two-second rule, I know.

53:42.199 --> 53:45.225
- Do you see anything?
- Hey, guys!

53:45.703 --> 53:47.796
This is really cool!

53:48.139 --> 53:49.606
What is he doing up there?

53:50.341 --> 53:52.809
Tommy, you see a road?

53:53.778 --> 53:55.803
Any signs of life?

53:57.715 --> 54:00.411
Are you kidding me?

54:00.885 --> 54:02.147
Tommy?

54:02.586 --> 54:05.419
Tom, do you see anything or not?

54:09.994 --> 54:12.121
I think I might still be stoned.

54:17.201 --> 54:19.999
Hello? Excuse me, miss?

54:20.237 --> 54:24.173
- Ladies?
- My name is Flower!

54:24.775 --> 54:27.175
You may call me Butterfly.

54:27.378 --> 54:28.902
And if you're
from the logging company,

54:29.113 --> 54:31.308
you'll have to speak to our lawyers.

54:31.716 --> 54:34.150
If you look to your left,
you can totally see her downstairs.

54:34.352 --> 54:35.717
What?

54:35.920 --> 54:38.821
We're not... We're not
from the logging company.

54:39.123 --> 54:40.147
- Peace.
- Peace.

54:40.358 --> 54:42.451
- Hey, peace.
- Peace.

54:42.660 --> 54:45.390
- What's your name?
- Jerry. Jerry Conlaine.

54:45.763 --> 54:47.958
And what's your forest name?

54:48.165 --> 54:51.794
Slug. His forest name is Slug.

54:52.003 --> 54:54.403
- I got you.
- Thanks, Tom, thanks a lot.

54:54.605 --> 54:57.631
I'm sorry, Slug. We can't
abandon our post.

54:57.842 --> 54:59.366
Do you understand?

54:59.577 --> 55:03.308
Well, could we come up there,
then? Please?

55:03.514 --> 55:04.674
Come on up.

55:04.882 --> 55:08.113
So then we run straight into
this freezing, like, water pond.

55:08.319 --> 55:11.015
We had to hide underwater,
but we used these reeds.

55:11.222 --> 55:13.884
Reeds? Like pussy willow reeds?
Really?

55:14.091 --> 55:16.889
God, it must've been so hard
to breathe.

55:17.094 --> 55:18.152
Yeah, it's been quite a trip.

55:18.362 --> 55:20.330
Do you guys have a cell phone
that we could use?

55:20.531 --> 55:23.523
Sorry, Slug. Cell phones are bad
for the environment

55:23.734 --> 55:25.497
and people who live
in the environment.

55:25.703 --> 55:26.965
- Right.
- You poor boys.

55:27.171 --> 55:29.105
You need to get out
of those damp, dirty clothes.

55:29.306 --> 55:31.240
Here, let us wash them for you.

55:31.709 --> 55:34.269
- No, no. I'm fine.
- Let us nurture you.

55:37.214 --> 55:38.374
Oh, boy!

55:38.783 --> 55:41.411
Mighty Oak could go
for some nurturing.

55:41.619 --> 55:44.611
- Stay right there.
- No. It's...

55:44.822 --> 55:47.052
Just relax, Condor.

55:47.291 --> 55:50.988
No, it's okay, honestly. I'm actually
not really into being touched.

55:51.195 --> 55:54.528
I'm a doctor, so I usually
do the touching.

55:54.732 --> 55:58.259
Yeah. I've been told I give
a very good calf massage.

55:58.469 --> 56:01.438
If you wanna roll down
those stockings, I could give you one.

56:01.639 --> 56:04.972
- Stockings?
- Leg warmers?

56:05.443 --> 56:07.536
I'm all-natural.

56:09.246 --> 56:10.577
Supernatural.

56:10.781 --> 56:17.619
<i>- You guys live up here year-round?
- We've been here 287 beautiful days.</i>

56:17.822 --> 56:19.119
How do you guys get supplies?

56:19.323 --> 56:23.157
When we need supplies, we radio
the Earth Child Support Network.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.827
Radio?

56:25.029 --> 56:27.224
You... You guys have a radio?

56:27.431 --> 56:31.094
Yeah. We haven't used it
since that last big thunderstorm.

56:31.302 --> 56:32.428
Remember that, Flower?

56:32.636 --> 56:37.232
Oh, my God. That thunderstorm
was so spiritual.

56:37.441 --> 56:42.105
Earth Child's limbs were just waving,
heaving back and forth,

56:42.313 --> 56:46.716
like she was dancing in the rhythm
to the thunder. It was just like...

56:51.055 --> 56:54.456
Full-on Tantric orgasm.

56:54.658 --> 56:57.354
- So where's this radio?
- Tree had an orgasm?

56:57.561 --> 56:58.528
You don't say.

56:58.729 --> 57:03.325
We danced naked
in the storm all night.

57:03.534 --> 57:07.061
And then held each other,
soaking wet, until the morning.

57:08.139 --> 57:12.599
The rain is like a drug.
It just makes you wanna...

57:13.210 --> 57:14.472
What? Makes you wanna what?

57:18.516 --> 57:20.313
Can we please use the radio?

57:20.518 --> 57:22.452
Sure thing, Slug.

57:23.821 --> 57:25.846
Wow. Monkey feet.

57:26.056 --> 57:28.115
Yeah. It's like a second pair of hands.

57:28.759 --> 57:31.284
Hello? Anyone out there?
My name's Jerry Conlaine,

57:31.495 --> 57:34.521
and my two friends and I
are lost in the woods. Hello?

57:34.732 --> 57:36.825
- You gotta say "Over. "
- Over.

57:37.034 --> 57:41.437
<i>I read you, son.
This is Breaker Station 22.</i>

57:41.872 --> 57:44.170
<i>- What is your position? Over.
- See? He said, "Over. "</i>

57:45.910 --> 57:48.845
We are two miles east
of Harold's Bluff

57:49.046 --> 57:53.346
in a giant redwood
called Earth Child. Over.

57:53.551 --> 57:59.649
<i>In a tree. We'll find you. We will
give assistance and whatnot.</i>

57:59.857 --> 58:01.882
Peace. Over.

58:02.092 --> 58:05.255
You just sit tight.
We're coming to get you.

58:05.629 --> 58:07.654
Over and out!

58:09.133 --> 58:11.465
So we ran out of food in Borneo,
so we just ended up

58:11.669 --> 58:14.502
eating our mosquito netting.
Just salted it up, and it was good.

58:14.705 --> 58:15.672
It was really good.

58:16.140 --> 58:19.940
Oh, you messy thing. Let me get that.

58:20.177 --> 58:21.166
Thank you.

58:21.412 --> 58:24.142
Well, there's plenty more
grubs here, Condor.

58:24.348 --> 58:27.112
Oh, no, I couldn't.
That bark shot right through me.

58:27.318 --> 58:29.809
I need to visit the little trees' room.

58:30.020 --> 58:32.079
Where do you guys do the do?

58:32.590 --> 58:34.114
Top side of the tree.

58:34.592 --> 58:36.526
Got a real kick to it.

58:39.230 --> 58:42.688
Bag it when you're done.
Put it in the basket up top.

58:42.900 --> 58:46.358
If you bring it in, you take it out.
Right?

58:46.570 --> 58:48.265
Okay, will do.

58:48.472 --> 58:50.167
Do you have any paper?

58:51.575 --> 58:53.941
Oh, great. You know,

58:54.144 --> 58:56.112
I think I'm gonna wait
until we get to the ranger station.

58:56.313 --> 58:58.440
Someone's here, someone's here.

58:59.849 --> 59:03.046
- Good afternoon, ladies.
- Nice-looking tree.

59:03.253 --> 59:04.948
End of the line, boys.
Come on down.

59:05.155 --> 59:06.122
- They're gonna kill Earth Child.
- No!

59:06.322 --> 59:09.416
No, they're not gonna kill
Earth Child. They're after us.

59:09.793 --> 59:11.920
We gotta get down and we gotta
make a run for it, all right?

59:14.297 --> 59:15.889
- No!
- No!

59:17.433 --> 59:18.764
Go to it, Elwood.

59:19.135 --> 59:21.899
We're gonna die up here
in this stupid tree.

59:22.105 --> 59:25.700
You know, Condor, even if your bodily
death is extraordinarily painful,

59:25.909 --> 59:29.174
- your soul will live on.
- Everything happens for a reason.

59:29.379 --> 59:31.939
Listen up, karma chameleons.
Nobody's dying.

59:32.448 --> 59:33.506
Here's the plan.

59:33.716 --> 59:35.877
Send those boys down,
pretty little birdies.

59:36.085 --> 59:39.179
I'm gonna rappel down.
And then I'm gonna secure the rope

59:39.389 --> 59:42.483
and then I'm gonna distract them.
You two slide down after me. All right?

59:42.692 --> 59:43.784
- Okay.
- Stop it!

59:43.993 --> 59:45.255
Cut it down, Elwood.

59:47.163 --> 59:49.358
Good plan, Jerry. One small change.

59:49.766 --> 59:51.825
Time to find out whether
I have the family curse or not.

59:52.202 --> 59:54.670
For me, Jer, for me?

59:55.805 --> 59:57.773
Yeah, go, go, go.

59:57.974 --> 59:59.373
Give them hell, Tommy.

59:59.943 --> 01:00:03.936
This Hell-mart's open for business,
and I'm slashing prices.

01:00:04.447 --> 01:00:08.440
- Stop!
- Come on, boys, don't be afraid.

01:00:08.885 --> 01:00:09.977
We gotta cover him.

01:00:10.186 --> 01:00:11.676
I have an idea.

01:00:14.858 --> 01:00:16.621
You just send those boys down.

01:00:16.826 --> 01:00:19.727
There won't be no more trouble
for you, Earth-mama.

01:00:19.929 --> 01:00:21.658
- Heavier than it looks.
- Oh, good idea.

01:00:21.865 --> 01:00:23.025
- Oh, yeah.
- You've got it.

01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:24.700
- Ready?
- You got it.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.537
- Oh yes.
- I'm hit. I'm hit.

01:00:32.775 --> 01:00:34.140
It's doody, Dennis.

01:00:34.344 --> 01:00:35.641
One, two, three.

01:00:35.845 --> 01:00:37.904
Oh, shit.

01:00:38.114 --> 01:00:39.672
Dano, let's go.

01:00:39.883 --> 01:00:42.716
Get away from my tree!

01:00:43.052 --> 01:00:44.383
This is wrong.

01:00:45.188 --> 01:00:47.656
- Okay.
- I can't do this, Jerry.

01:00:47.857 --> 01:00:48.983
Okay.

01:00:49.192 --> 01:00:50.386
Jamming up my gun barrel.

01:00:50.593 --> 01:00:53.221
- This is not me.
- You're a beautiful spirit.

01:00:53.429 --> 01:00:57.388
Fly free and know
that love follows you.

01:01:00.303 --> 01:01:03.122
Thank you, kind, crazy,
hairy lady of my dreams.

01:01:03.157 --> 01:01:05.941
Thank you, kind, crazy,
hairy lady of my dreams.

01:01:07.777 --> 01:01:09.244
It was cute.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.176
- Get off my tree!
- Shoot her.

01:01:13.783 --> 01:01:15.307
Filthy hippie! Shoot her again.

01:01:15.518 --> 01:01:17.816
That is it!

01:01:18.555 --> 01:01:21.251
- I don't wanna do this, Jerry.
- Remember when we used to jump off

01:01:21.457 --> 01:01:24.915
that railroad bridge into Cedar Lake?
That was higher than this.

01:01:25.128 --> 01:01:26.686
No, no. I never jumped off of there.

01:01:26.896 --> 01:01:28.796
You guys always pushed me
when I wasn't looking.

01:01:28.998 --> 01:01:30.260
Oh, yeah.

01:01:34.103 --> 01:01:35.593
Go!

01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:41.469
- Hold on, Dan.
- I made it.

01:01:42.579 --> 01:01:44.809
Did I kill your grandma?

01:01:45.014 --> 01:01:47.244
- I don't think so.
- Where are they getting all this poo?

01:01:52.355 --> 01:01:54.050
He's getting away on my wheeler!

01:01:54.824 --> 01:01:57.315
- Get him, Elwood.
- I'm gonna shoot him!

01:02:07.837 --> 01:02:11.637
Come on, let's go. Get on, get on.
Move, baby, move. Come on, Jer.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:15.477
Go. Go.

01:02:15.678 --> 01:02:17.771
- Hold on.
- Come on, Dennis, we gotta move.

01:02:17.981 --> 01:02:20.108
All right, I'm on. Go. Go.

01:02:22.085 --> 01:02:23.518
Hold on, Dano.

01:02:28.257 --> 01:02:30.157
Can't this thing go any faster?

01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:34.288
Shoot the one driving!

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:38.800
What are you doing?

01:02:39.002 --> 01:02:42.130
I'm pretending I'm on a speeder bike
so I can block out reality.

01:02:42.338 --> 01:02:44.363
It's my process. Leave me alone.

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:56.541
Over there. It looks like a clearing.

01:02:57.587 --> 01:02:58.713
That way.

01:03:00.023 --> 01:03:01.115
That way, that way, that way!

01:03:15.772 --> 01:03:17.069
Damn it, Elwood.

01:03:17.273 --> 01:03:19.298
I think I just swallowed my underpants.

01:03:22.345 --> 01:03:23.505
Shoot them.

01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:28.714
- I can't believe they survived that fall.
- Dennis, they're getting away.

01:03:28.918 --> 01:03:30.715
No, they're trapped like rats.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.945
Only way they can go now
is up the mountain.

01:03:33.156 --> 01:03:36.023
We know right where they're headed.
Let's go.

01:03:41.831 --> 01:03:43.765
- Flat tire.
- Damn it, Tom.

01:03:44.768 --> 01:03:46.099
Keep moving.

01:03:50.073 --> 01:03:51.631
Getting close, Elwood.

01:04:00.016 --> 01:04:01.677
This way.

01:04:05.388 --> 01:04:08.255
All right, that is it. I'm out.

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:09.891
I'm out.

01:04:10.226 --> 01:04:11.887
I'm out.

01:04:12.762 --> 01:04:16.493
I have spent the last, like, two hours
within sniffing distance

01:04:16.699 --> 01:04:23.070
of a sweaty ball sack and a sweaty
ball sack, and I am out. I'm out.

01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:24.863
What does that mean?

01:04:25.341 --> 01:04:28.606
I think it means he's out.
Like, coming out.

01:04:28.878 --> 01:04:31.346
Like, he's finally admitted he's gay.

01:04:31.848 --> 01:04:35.909
You know, I'm just gonna stay
here until help comes.

01:04:36.119 --> 01:04:38.883
I mean, this is serious.
I lost my inhaler.

01:04:39.089 --> 01:04:41.057
I've known you almost,
what, 25 years now?

01:04:41.257 --> 01:04:45.125
I've never seen you have
even a hint of asthma, anything.

01:04:45.328 --> 01:04:49.958
That's because I have the inhaler,
Jerry.

01:04:50.166 --> 01:04:54.125
No, I think Jerry's right. I think
this whole thing's just in your head.

01:04:54.337 --> 01:04:57.864
You just need to take a couple of real
deep breaths and you'll get over it.

01:04:58.108 --> 01:04:59.507
Oh, okay, why didn't I think of that?

01:04:59.709 --> 01:05:02.439
I'll just get over my chronic
respiratory illness.

01:05:02.645 --> 01:05:04.613
I'll just breathe.

01:05:05.415 --> 01:05:06.848
There you go. I'm over it.

01:05:07.383 --> 01:05:09.647
See? That wasn't that hard, was it?

01:05:09.853 --> 01:05:12.083
You gotta relax, Dano. All right?

01:05:12.288 --> 01:05:15.223
It's no time to give up hope.
Let's just keep going.

01:05:16.326 --> 01:05:19.693
No, actually, Jerry, I'm convinced that
this is the perfect time to give up hope.

01:05:19.896 --> 01:05:23.093
I don't know that there has ever been
a better time to give up hope.

01:05:23.299 --> 01:05:25.859
I mean, look at this.

01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:29.971
Things are as bad
as they could possibly get.

01:05:37.313 --> 01:05:39.611
I stand corrected.

01:05:44.587 --> 01:05:45.952
Elwood, what are you doing?

01:05:46.156 --> 01:05:48.954
It's raining. It's raining.

01:05:52.762 --> 01:05:55.731
Tom, man, get under here.
You're gonna die of pneumonia.

01:05:56.399 --> 01:05:58.629
No, but we will die of hypothermia.

01:06:00.036 --> 01:06:02.504
Look, our only chance
is to huddle together.

01:06:02.972 --> 01:06:05.532
We gotta huddle our bodies together
for warmth.

01:06:05.842 --> 01:06:08.208
I, for one, choose death.

01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:09.844
Interesting.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.412
One minute you mock
my sweaty ball sack,

01:06:14.617 --> 01:06:16.482
and now you wanna cuddle with it.

01:06:16.853 --> 01:06:20.380
You know, the whole huddle-up thing

01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:23.582
is the oldest trick in the book.
I've used it.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.418
It's just for getting a girl naked.

01:06:25.628 --> 01:06:26.993
Worked, though.

01:06:27.764 --> 01:06:28.890
Every time.

01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:13.937
This never leaves the cave.

01:07:18.248 --> 01:07:19.875
I'm starting to feel warm.

01:07:20.083 --> 01:07:22.313
See? I told you guys.

01:07:22.619 --> 01:07:24.644
Let's just try and get some sleep.

01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:30.591
Hey, Dano.

01:07:31.194 --> 01:07:34.493
How hot were those chicks
in the tree?

01:07:35.798 --> 01:07:37.766
They were hairy, but hot.

01:07:38.034 --> 01:07:40.025
The rain,

01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:42.802
dancing to the rhythm of the thunder,

01:07:43.406 --> 01:07:47.502
full-on Tantric orgasm,
are you kidding me? Hey, didn't?

01:07:47.977 --> 01:07:50.377
Didn't she kiss you once?

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.338
It was nice.

01:07:52.548 --> 01:07:54.038
Oh, my God.

01:07:54.384 --> 01:07:58.684
They are probably dancing naked
right now.

01:07:58.955 --> 01:08:00.752
Dancing...

01:08:01.324 --> 01:08:05.624
Soaking wet.

01:08:07.597 --> 01:08:08.859
Hey.

01:08:09.966 --> 01:08:12.628
Hey! Oh, my God, Dano,
how could you?!

01:08:12.835 --> 01:08:16.202
It wasn't me, it was Jerry.
Jerry, why would you do that?

01:08:16.406 --> 01:08:18.805
I'm sorry. My bad. I'm so sorry.

01:08:19.008 --> 01:08:21.272
What happens in the cave,
stays in the cave.

01:08:21.477 --> 01:08:23.638
Oh, my God. That was your...

01:08:23.845 --> 01:08:25.871
Come back to bed, you guys.
I'm freezing.

01:08:26.082 --> 01:08:28.050
Not till he puts Jabba back in his hut.

01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:30.617
Freeze, perverts.

01:08:36.826 --> 01:08:39.350
Wait, wait, wait, just...
Please don't shoot us, okay?

01:08:39.562 --> 01:08:41.029
This isn't what it looks like.

01:08:41.397 --> 01:08:43.160
If you're gonna rape somebody,
rape Dano.

01:08:44.334 --> 01:08:45.995
Did I ask you to talk?

01:08:46.202 --> 01:08:47.725
- No.
- Come with me,

01:08:47.937 --> 01:08:50.234
or I'll shoot your testicles off

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:53.966
and stuff them and mount
them on my mantelpiece.

01:08:56.446 --> 01:08:58.310
That's gonna be an ugly mantelpiece.

01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:02.109
- Go on.
- That's it, come on.

01:09:17.233 --> 01:09:19.029
What is it?

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:23.068
Cinnamon.

01:09:24.273 --> 01:09:27.935
What the hell are you doing, collecting
herbs for your goddamn herb garden?

01:09:28.144 --> 01:09:31.580
Well, all the twigs are broken.
They've been through here.

01:09:32.115 --> 01:09:33.979
That they have.

01:09:34.716 --> 01:09:37.310
- Nice place.
- Get along.

01:09:38.154 --> 01:09:40.054
- Build this yourself?
- Open the door.

01:09:42.925 --> 01:09:44.859
- Okay, I'm going.
- That's it.

01:09:45.428 --> 01:09:47.395
It's a lot warmer in here.

01:10:00.477 --> 01:10:02.468
I think he's gonna try to cook us.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:08.516
Where you going?

01:10:13.323 --> 01:10:17.123
<i>Oh, Susanna</i>

01:10:17.327 --> 01:10:19.887
<i>Don't you cry for me</i>

01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:22.423
If you're gonna kill us,
just do it already, okay?

01:10:22.632 --> 01:10:24.862
I am sick of waiting to die.

01:10:25.068 --> 01:10:26.228
Okay.

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:29.595
- Was that reckless?
- Yes.

01:10:29.906 --> 01:10:32.170
If I was gonna kill you,
I would have done it outside.

01:10:33.042 --> 01:10:34.737
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I agree.

01:10:34.944 --> 01:10:37.276
- You're a very gracious man.
- That's a good one.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.742
Yes, with a happy ending.

01:10:39.616 --> 01:10:40.742
D.B.

01:10:43.453 --> 01:10:46.889
- What'd you call me?
- D.B. The maps...

01:10:47.557 --> 01:10:49.491
You are, aren't you?
You're D.B. Cooper.

01:10:49.726 --> 01:10:51.785
No, I ain't D.B. Cooper.

01:10:53.363 --> 01:10:55.058
That's ancient history.

01:10:56.599 --> 01:10:58.897
I tell you what's not
ancient history, though.

01:10:59.102 --> 01:11:05.200
It's three naked deviates
on my mountain.

01:11:05.408 --> 01:11:09.276
We were searching for D.B.
And, yes, we're naked,

01:11:09.479 --> 01:11:12.937
and we're trespassing, but
there's a perfectly good explanation.

01:11:14.784 --> 01:11:20.188
First thing, I want you to put
some clothes on.

01:11:22.158 --> 01:11:25.218
And then I'd like to hear this story.

01:11:25.595 --> 01:11:27.256
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

01:11:27.463 --> 01:11:29.226
More of your own
homemade fashions?

01:11:29.432 --> 01:11:31.593
I wouldn't mind wearing
one of these deer pelts up there.

01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:33.462
I'd get dressed faster if I was you

01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:35.831
because I've been alone in this cabin
for 30 years.

01:11:36.039 --> 01:11:37.336
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:41.738
They would've come in here
to escape the rain.

01:11:43.346 --> 01:11:45.906
They laid down right here, Dennis.

01:11:46.115 --> 01:11:47.173
Right here.

01:11:47.383 --> 01:11:48.816
Lay down beside me.

01:11:49.018 --> 01:11:51.509
In order to stalk your prey,

01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:54.690
you gotta go where they go
and do what they do.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:58.052
Then a scuffle broke out,

01:11:58.261 --> 01:12:00.024
and there were some harsh words
exchanged,

01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:03.927
and they beat that little one
until he was limp.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.531
Elwood,

01:12:05.935 --> 01:12:07.425
I don't need to know
what happened.

01:12:07.637 --> 01:12:10.504
I just need to know
which way they went.

01:12:13.109 --> 01:12:16.442
Up-mountain. All right, let's get back
to the wheeler.

01:12:16.646 --> 01:12:18.375
I know a shortcut
around Devil's Staircase.

01:12:18.581 --> 01:12:20.947
We can still beat them to the summit.

01:12:22.652 --> 01:12:26.349
And then you, you scared us
with your testicle-mounting speech.

01:12:26.556 --> 01:12:28.724
That just came right off the top
of my head.

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:30.553
- It was very scary.
- It was creepy too.

01:12:31.193 --> 01:12:34.822
May I ask you one question?
Could you really see their downstairs?

01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:38.555
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You could
see everything. It was...

01:12:38.767 --> 01:12:40.200
It was quite a view.

01:12:41.803 --> 01:12:43.737
So, Del,

01:12:44.406 --> 01:12:46.067
were you D.B.'s partner?

01:12:46.374 --> 01:12:48.433
And his best friend too.

01:12:49.311 --> 01:12:53.577
We've known each other ever since
we were able to pee straight.

01:12:53.815 --> 01:12:55.112
So...

01:12:57.619 --> 01:12:59.883
- Is he still alive?
- Hell, I don't know.

01:13:00.388 --> 01:13:02.049
D.B. Had this plan, see.

01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:07.255
When he jumped out of the airplane,
he was gonna land

01:13:07.462 --> 01:13:12.627
3 degrees northwest
of Red Devil Ridge.

01:13:12.834 --> 01:13:15.632
And he had a flashlight.
He was gonna signal me,

01:13:15.837 --> 01:13:20.968
I'd find him and then we were gonna
work our way down to Rio.

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:23.336
I love Rio.

01:13:23.545 --> 01:13:25.479
What...? What happened?

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.806
It snowed.

01:13:27.482 --> 01:13:29.507
A blizzard. You couldn't see anything.

01:13:29.718 --> 01:13:31.549
You couldn't see your hand
in front of your face.

01:13:31.753 --> 01:13:33.084
Hell, I don't know where he landed.

01:13:33.288 --> 01:13:37.418
I looked for him for months
and months. So did the FBI,

01:13:37.626 --> 01:13:40.754
so did the cops. No D.B., no money.

01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:43.196
But you could've left.

01:13:43.398 --> 01:13:45.457
Why'd you stay up here
all these years?

01:13:45.801 --> 01:13:48.361
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

01:13:49.004 --> 01:13:50.164
You know what I mean, kid?

01:13:50.472 --> 01:13:51.939
Yeah,

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.265
- I do.
- Have you ever spent

01:13:54.476 --> 01:13:55.465
30 years in a cabin?

01:13:56.111 --> 01:13:58.136
- No.
- Then you don't know what I mean.

01:13:58.446 --> 01:14:02.075
I mean, metaphorically,
I know what you mean.

01:14:02.284 --> 01:14:04.775
Metaphorically, have you ever spent
30 years in a cabin?

01:14:04.986 --> 01:14:06.647
Ye... No.

01:14:06.855 --> 01:14:09.255
Well, then, think before you talk.

01:14:10.725 --> 01:14:15.287
Point is, I've spent the best years
of my life sitting on the porch,

01:14:15.497 --> 01:14:18.261
playing the harmonica,
waiting for something better,

01:14:18.466 --> 01:14:21.867
and the years have been going
by faster and faster.

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:23.298
And then all of a sudden,

01:14:24.372 --> 01:14:26.237
I was an old man.

01:14:28.243 --> 01:14:31.212
Well, I bet you can play the shit
out of that harmonica.

01:14:32.581 --> 01:14:33.946
That I can.

01:14:35.584 --> 01:14:38.018
Except there's no one around
to hear me play it.

01:14:38.587 --> 01:14:41.613
Piece of advice:
You can lose your money,

01:14:41.823 --> 01:14:44.223
you can spend all of it,

01:14:44.426 --> 01:14:47.987
and if you work hard,
you get it all back.

01:14:48.463 --> 01:14:50.727
But if you waste your time,

01:14:52.167 --> 01:14:54.397
you're never gonna get it back.

01:14:55.971 --> 01:14:59.168
Whatever it is you fellas
are looking for,

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:01.767
you gotta go out and get it.

01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:04.906
And you gotta go right now.

01:15:07.482 --> 01:15:10.349
Not right now, you idiots.

01:15:13.521 --> 01:15:16.149
Well, you boys get some sleep.

01:15:16.358 --> 01:15:19.191
In the morning, I'm gonna point you
in the right direction,

01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:21.362
get you right off this mountain.

01:15:30.305 --> 01:15:31.966
Morning.

01:15:35.877 --> 01:15:37.139
Bacon.

01:15:37.345 --> 01:15:38.937
Squirrel.

01:15:40.548 --> 01:15:42.345
Squirrel.

01:15:44.219 --> 01:15:46.187
Nice T-shirt, JJ.

01:15:46.755 --> 01:15:49.315
That's my JJ Walker T-shirt.

01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:52.150
"Dy-no-mite. "

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.487
Dy-no-mite.

01:15:55.096 --> 01:15:57.291
Dy-no-mite.

01:15:57.499 --> 01:15:58.966
Dy-no-mite!

01:15:59.234 --> 01:16:00.258
That's too big.

01:16:00.702 --> 01:16:01.862
- Bathroom?
- Outside.

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:03.037
Thought so.

01:16:03.838 --> 01:16:05.533
Dy-no-mite.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:06.968
Dy-no-mite.

01:16:07.175 --> 01:16:09.075
Creeping me out.

01:16:14.616 --> 01:16:16.584
Look at this.

01:16:38.373 --> 01:16:40.603
Does a bear shit in the woods?

01:16:42.277 --> 01:16:44.768
Hey. Does a bear shit in the woods?

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.210
My cell phone.
Where did you find that?

01:16:47.415 --> 01:16:49.212
Does a bear shit in the woods?

01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:51.612
- Usually.
- Unbelievable.

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.310
I gotta make a quick call,
all right?

01:16:53.521 --> 01:16:55.148
- Who you gonna call?
- Ghostbusters?

01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:57.081
Denise.

01:16:59.394 --> 01:17:02.795
<i>Hi. Jerry and Denise
are no longer doing it.</i>

01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:06.161
<i>If you need Denise,
call her on her cell.</i>

01:17:12.374 --> 01:17:14.274
It's killing time!

01:17:14.476 --> 01:17:16.808
Come on, Jerry, get down.

01:17:31.259 --> 01:17:34.922
Hey, come on, now. Give me a hand.

01:17:36.664 --> 01:17:38.256
Every time I get comfortable.

01:17:38.466 --> 01:17:41.367
Listen up. Go due north till
you get to the top of the ridge,

01:17:41.736 --> 01:17:44.068
then you go directly west.

01:17:44.272 --> 01:17:45.739
- Okay.
- Just keep going,

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:47.430
you'll come to an old mining trail.

01:17:47.642 --> 01:17:49.872
Follow that right down to the bottom
of the mountain.

01:17:50.645 --> 01:17:51.907
All right.

01:17:53.081 --> 01:17:54.673
You go right, I go left.

01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:57.147
- Okay.
- I love this part.

01:17:57.352 --> 01:17:59.081
- Come on,
- He say left or right?

01:17:59.287 --> 01:18:01.380
Have a good life, boys.

01:18:06.261 --> 01:18:09.492
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go!

01:18:21.376 --> 01:18:25.574
When you peckerwoods get
your diapers clean, come on back.

01:18:25.814 --> 01:18:27.577
I'll be waiting.

01:18:30.218 --> 01:18:31.412
West is this way.

01:18:31.619 --> 01:18:32.711
We're not going west.

01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:34.912
Yes, we are. The compass says so.

01:18:35.123 --> 01:18:38.388
The compass came out of a cereal box,
so why are we running the wrong way?

01:18:38.626 --> 01:18:40.116
Iron. Iron.

01:18:40.328 --> 01:18:41.317
What?

01:18:41.529 --> 01:18:44.259
Iron ore. There's iron in the hills.

01:18:44.466 --> 01:18:45.558
It's throwing off the magnet.

01:18:45.767 --> 01:18:48.031
Tell Mr. Wizard that we're still going
the wrong way.

01:18:48.236 --> 01:18:50.067
Which means Del's compass,
it wouldn't work here.

01:18:50.271 --> 01:18:53.001
If D.B. Was supposed to land
3 degrees northwest of Devil's Ridge,

01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:54.698
it would've come off as directly west.

01:18:54.909 --> 01:18:55.876
Who cares about D.B.

01:18:56.077 --> 01:18:57.772
Which means he would've landed
somewhere...

01:19:03.852 --> 01:19:07.811
Oh, my throat, neck, chest.

01:19:10.058 --> 01:19:12.959
Guys, I think we found him.

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:17.455
Jesus.

01:19:29.244 --> 01:19:30.268
This is him.

01:19:30.478 --> 01:19:31.809
This is D.B. Cooper.

01:19:32.013 --> 01:19:34.811
It has to be.
The parachute and the briefcase.

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:38.811
He must have broke his legs in the
landing and then stumbled in this hole.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:39.987
You poor bastard.

01:19:40.188 --> 01:19:42.281
Del was looking for him,
but it was winter.

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:44.515
And the snow must have covered up
the top there.

01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:50.962
- We found him.
- That's him.

01:19:51.166 --> 01:19:52.224
- I can't believe we did it.
- D.B. Cooper.

01:19:52.433 --> 01:19:53.695
Who else would it be?

01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:56.137
This case is empty. The money's gone.

01:19:56.337 --> 01:19:59.534
No, look.
Look what he's holding.

01:20:03.244 --> 01:20:05.144
He burnt the cash to stay warm.

01:20:05.346 --> 01:20:09.680
He traded every dollar
for just a few more hours of life.

01:20:09.884 --> 01:20:11.613
So much for the treasure.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.751
No, that's it.

01:20:15.323 --> 01:20:18.019
Being alive, that's the treasure.

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.355
Here he is, boys,

01:20:20.728 --> 01:20:23.026
the great D.B. Cooper
and his treasure.

01:20:23.531 --> 01:20:29.197
And we found it, so we get our most
valuable possessions back.

01:20:30.872 --> 01:20:31.998
Yeah.

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:37.701
Gentlemen.

01:20:50.892 --> 01:20:54.419
Time to leave this stuff behind
and get the hell home.

01:20:54.829 --> 01:20:56.922
Come on, Elwood.

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:04.165
Well, boss. What's the plan now?

01:21:04.372 --> 01:21:06.306
First we gotta find our way out
of this hellhole,

01:21:06.507 --> 01:21:08.372
- and then we make a run for it.
- No.

01:21:08.576 --> 01:21:09.838
No more running.

01:21:10.078 --> 01:21:12.444
After everything we've been through,

01:21:13.348 --> 01:21:16.579
Dr. Mott has finally run out of things
to be afraid of.

01:21:17.819 --> 01:21:22.256
Do you hear that? I'm not scared
of you, you Neanderthal dicks!

01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:23.582
Okay, okay.

01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:25.520
We got it, we got it, all right?

01:21:25.727 --> 01:21:27.854
Hey, look, there's light coming
from over there.

01:21:28.062 --> 01:21:30.963
- What is that, a tunnel?
- Maybe it leads out of here.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:34.663
We're never getting through there...

01:21:35.169 --> 01:21:36.397
..Tom.

01:21:38.706 --> 01:21:41.266
- Dano?
- No.

01:21:41.476 --> 01:21:43.103
No. No way.

01:21:43.311 --> 01:21:45.302
What happened to the badass
over there?

01:21:45.513 --> 01:21:48.380
What happened to running out of
things to be afraid of?

01:21:48.883 --> 01:21:52.751
That was... This is just
a small, dark space.

01:21:52.954 --> 01:21:55.422
I can't, I can't, it's a deal-breaker.

01:21:55.623 --> 01:21:57.523
This could lead out of here.

01:21:57.725 --> 01:22:00.387
Dan, you're the only one small enough
to go through.

01:22:00.762 --> 01:22:02.559
That's what she said.

01:22:05.433 --> 01:22:09.392
It's... It's a mine shaft.
They had to get the ore out somehow.

01:22:09.604 --> 01:22:10.935
It's our only chance, Dano.

01:22:11.139 --> 01:22:12.936
Come on, prairie dog.

01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:14.999
You can do it.

01:22:17.312 --> 01:22:19.246
I don't think that's helping.

01:22:20.481 --> 01:22:22.813
Okay.

01:22:24.252 --> 01:22:25.310
Come on.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.545
Let's get him like this
and slide him in.

01:22:36.531 --> 01:22:38.362
Keep going, buddy.

01:22:38.933 --> 01:22:41.925
Keep going. There's gotta be light.
Do you see light?

01:22:42.136 --> 01:22:44.161
I don't think I can.

01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:45.867
I don't think I can.

01:22:46.574 --> 01:22:50.066
Come on, Dan.
Soothing songs from the past.

01:22:50.278 --> 01:22:56.615
<i>Do you really wanna hurt me?</i>

01:22:56.818 --> 01:23:01.949
<i>Do you really wanna make me cry?</i>

01:23:03.057 --> 01:23:06.686
<i>Precious kisses, words that burn me</i>

01:23:07.028 --> 01:23:10.555
<i>Lovers never ask you why</i>

01:23:10.865 --> 01:23:14.562
<i>Do you really wanna hurt me?</i>

01:23:14.769 --> 01:23:16.134
Come on, Dano!

01:23:16.337 --> 01:23:20.603
<i>Do you really wanna make me cry?</i>

01:23:20.808 --> 01:23:24.904
<i>- Quiet.
- Precious kisses, words that burn me</i>

01:23:25.113 --> 01:23:27.707
<i>Lovers never ask you why</i>

01:23:28.082 --> 01:23:30.346
- The hills have gone gay.
- No, no.

01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:33.042
<i>- It's Culture Club.
- Do you really wanna make me cry?</i>

01:23:33.254 --> 01:23:37.782
<i>- I had a New Wave phase.
- Precious kisses, words that love me</i>

01:23:38.059 --> 01:23:41.654
<i>Lovers never ask you why</i>

01:23:41.863 --> 01:23:46.095
<i>Do you really wanna hurt me?</i>

01:23:46.701 --> 01:23:49.295
<i>Hurt me</i>

01:23:49.537 --> 01:23:54.201
<i>Do you really want to make me cry?</i>

01:23:54.409 --> 01:23:58.709
<i>Yes, we really wanna hurt you</i>

01:23:58.913 --> 01:24:02.849
<i>Yes, we really wanna make you cry</i>

01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:05.066
<i>Precious kisses, words that burn me</i>

01:24:05.101 --> 01:24:07.083
<i>Precious kisses, words that burn me</i>

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.084
<i>Lovers never ask you...</i>

01:24:12.125 --> 01:24:13.183
How you like me now?

01:24:14.961 --> 01:24:18.124
Well, well, well.
We gotcha, little city boys.

01:24:18.331 --> 01:24:19.559
We sure gotcha.

01:24:19.766 --> 01:24:21.631
I think this is just a misunderstanding.

01:24:21.834 --> 01:24:25.361
- That was quite a run you gave us.
- You ain't running nowhere now.

01:24:25.571 --> 01:24:26.697
What am I doing?

01:24:26.906 --> 01:24:28.203
- The game's up.
- Hold on, Dennis.

01:24:28.407 --> 01:24:30.466
I have a wonderful idea.

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:33.437
Can I use this, please?

01:24:33.646 --> 01:24:37.707
Elwood, that is the best idea
you have had, ever.

01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:39.711
We gotcha now.

01:24:47.894 --> 01:24:50.419
How you like me now?

01:24:52.865 --> 01:24:54.560
Good work, Dan.

01:24:57.937 --> 01:24:59.165
Watch out!

01:25:05.044 --> 01:25:06.534
You got them, guys!

01:25:14.153 --> 01:25:15.643
Elwood, you all right?

01:25:21.027 --> 01:25:22.289
Good one, Jerry. You're awesome!

01:25:22.495 --> 01:25:24.326
Stop cheerleading and help, man!

01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:25.861
- Right.
- Get them, Elwood.

01:25:26.065 --> 01:25:28.966
- Get him off me.
- Hey. There's a grenade up here.

01:25:29.168 --> 01:25:30.192
No!

01:25:32.138 --> 01:25:35.005
No biting. No biting!

01:26:04.571 --> 01:26:06.163
Gun.

01:26:19.486 --> 01:26:20.578
Sheriff.

01:26:20.787 --> 01:26:22.721
Sheriff. Thank God you're here.

01:26:22.923 --> 01:26:24.185
My friends are in that hole.

01:26:24.391 --> 01:26:27.155
And these guys are down there beating
them up. And these are their guns.

01:26:27.361 --> 01:26:28.726
They got us in this hole.

01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:32.624
Having a spot of trouble,
are you, city slickers?

01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:35.324
Sheriff. I never thought I'd be happy
to see you again.

01:26:35.535 --> 01:26:37.332
Give me that.

01:26:37.537 --> 01:26:40.267
Hey, hey. Fight's over, fellas.

01:26:40.474 --> 01:26:42.874
Come on, Jer. Come up.

01:26:45.212 --> 01:26:47.874
- Good work, Dano.
- You too. I can't believe we made it.

01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:49.673
Not quite.

01:26:50.284 --> 01:26:53.185
All right, ladies, on your feet.
Let's get this over with.

01:26:53.887 --> 01:26:57.846
Jesus, Hank. We were scared
you was never gonna come.

01:26:58.058 --> 01:27:00.788
- Oh, I scared you, did I? I scared you?
- Yeah, you did.

01:27:00.994 --> 01:27:03.155
- It's all about you, isn't it, Elwood?
- These boys have been running all over.

01:27:03.363 --> 01:27:04.853
Well, it's a damn good thing I got here.

01:27:05.332 --> 01:27:08.733
You two been shooting up this
goddamn mountain for three days,

01:27:08.936 --> 01:27:10.927
chasing these jag-offs.

01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:14.198
Nice racket, sheriff. What,
do you get a cut of the weed profits?

01:27:15.108 --> 01:27:18.441
Profits? They work for me, ass-wipe.

01:27:18.645 --> 01:27:23.105
What are you gonna tell our families?
You can't exactly explain this away.

01:27:23.583 --> 01:27:25.016
Explaining?

01:27:25.552 --> 01:27:27.417
We don't have to explain anything.

01:27:27.721 --> 01:27:31.953
It's just three more city boys got lost
on the river, that's all.

01:27:32.292 --> 01:27:35.090
Hey, I bet they got eaten up
by scavengers.

01:27:35.329 --> 01:27:37.194
- It's a terrible shame.
- Dano.

01:27:37.397 --> 01:27:38.694
- Case closed.
- Let's shoot them.

01:27:38.899 --> 01:27:40.799
I wanna shoot the little redhead one
right there.

01:27:41.401 --> 01:27:44.234
Now, look, I'm tired of talking.

01:27:46.106 --> 01:27:47.869
Let's get this done with.

01:27:48.075 --> 01:27:50.566
Over the edge you go, boys.

01:27:50.777 --> 01:27:51.835
- Wait!
- Shut up.

01:27:52.045 --> 01:27:53.603
Wait, sheriff. Wait, wait, wait.

01:27:53.814 --> 01:27:57.978
- Sheriff, I'm gonna shoot them now.
- No, no, let's listen to this.

01:27:58.185 --> 01:27:59.948
Look,

01:28:00.954 --> 01:28:03.445
you and I, we're cut
from the same cloth.

01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:05.624
I mean, we're a lot alike,
don't you think?

01:28:05.859 --> 01:28:10.387
Yeah, sure, I'm better with numbers
and I bathe often.

01:28:10.597 --> 01:28:15.330
I have a dental plan that allows me
to keep all my teeth, unlike yourself.

01:28:18.472 --> 01:28:20.497
- Yeah?
- I learned a little something

01:28:20.707 --> 01:28:24.609
the last couple days, getting chased
by ass-face and dick-chin there.

01:28:24.811 --> 01:28:26.176
And that is...

01:28:26.413 --> 01:28:29.143
I have two of the best friends
anyone could ever ask for.

01:28:29.349 --> 01:28:32.011
I've got the love of a good woman.

01:28:32.219 --> 01:28:35.882
I've got a really good life.
I mean, I've got an amazing life.

01:28:37.257 --> 01:28:41.057
And I've decided that my life's
worth living. Now, you have to decide

01:28:41.261 --> 01:28:44.560
if your life's worth living too,
because if it is,

01:28:45.265 --> 01:28:47.096
you put your gun down.

01:28:47.634 --> 01:28:49.033
And if we don't?

01:28:51.738 --> 01:28:54.536
- Bye, bye, boys.
- It's go time.

01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:57.801
- Do this to him.
- Put the pin back in the grenade.

01:28:58.011 --> 01:29:00.502
- That is my grenade, sir.
- The plan was for me to sacrifice

01:29:00.714 --> 01:29:03.205
myself if need be
while you two ran for it.

01:29:03.417 --> 01:29:04.679
- I didn't know.
- My grenade...

01:29:04.885 --> 01:29:07.581
- I'm not a mind reader, Jerry.
- Give me back my grenade.

01:29:12.292 --> 01:29:13.816
Run!

01:29:14.795 --> 01:29:16.057
It's gonna blow!

01:29:27.207 --> 01:29:28.834
All right, that's it. You're dead.

01:29:29.042 --> 01:29:31.875
When all this is over, someone's
buying the first round. Not it.

01:29:32.079 --> 01:29:34.343
- Not it.
- Enough of this shit. Just shoot them.

01:29:34.548 --> 01:29:36.448
Do you think there's beer in heaven?

01:29:37.384 --> 01:29:38.783
I was thinking about the bar
in town.

01:30:03.143 --> 01:30:05.611
- Let's get off this mountain.
- All right.

01:30:08.181 --> 01:30:13.676
These charges are "unsubstantuated"
and "injustifigurable" and...

01:30:13.887 --> 01:30:17.254
That's right. We did it.
How you like me now?

01:30:17.457 --> 01:30:20.085
This is the scene here
at police headquarters

01:30:20.293 --> 01:30:23.319
as three local heroes emerge
to a cheering crowd.

01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:26.624
The men accidentally helped break up
one of the biggest drug rings

01:30:26.833 --> 01:30:30.769
in state history while hiking
in a remote section of the Cascades.

01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:33.234
My old man would not believe this.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.200
- Billy wouldn't believe it.
- Actually, know what?

01:30:36.409 --> 01:30:37.774
I think he would.

01:30:38.178 --> 01:30:42.274
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this ensemble. I like it.

01:30:42.482 --> 01:30:43.915
- Look at you.
- Thank you, boys.

01:30:44.117 --> 01:30:45.914
Look at this stud. Del!

01:30:46.119 --> 01:30:48.417
No names. Fuzz.

01:30:48.955 --> 01:30:53.016
Glad I caught you guys before you
headed out. I got something for you.

01:30:53.426 --> 01:30:54.552
What's this?

01:30:54.994 --> 01:30:58.088
- D.B.'s parachute. Are you sure?
- Damn sure.

01:30:58.298 --> 01:31:00.596
There's a little something for you
rolled up inside there too.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.700
- Thank you.
- So where you headed?

01:31:02.902 --> 01:31:05.837
Thought I'd see the world.
I might even hit Washington.

01:31:06.706 --> 01:31:09.140
Wow. One state over.

01:31:09.342 --> 01:31:13.073
Till I do, I'm just telling tall tales.

01:31:17.283 --> 01:31:21.344
Remember, carry your friends
wherever you go.

01:31:21.721 --> 01:31:23.154
Close to your heart.

01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:26.688
Or on your back.
I got D.B.'s bones in my satchel.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.755
Thought I'd give him a proper burial.

01:31:30.964 --> 01:31:35.230
I spent 30 years
waiting to have a life.

01:31:37.937 --> 01:31:40.872
- What the hell?
- Oh, my gosh.

01:31:41.107 --> 01:31:42.506
Oh, my God.

01:31:43.676 --> 01:31:44.700
D.B. Didn't burn it all.

01:31:45.545 --> 01:31:47.809
He couldn't. It was Del's share.

01:31:48.047 --> 01:31:49.810
There's gotta be 100 grand in here.

01:31:50.016 --> 01:31:52.507
We'll split it three ways.

01:31:52.752 --> 01:31:54.617
One-third, one-third, one-third?

01:31:55.488 --> 01:31:57.115
You know what?

01:31:58.324 --> 01:32:01.122
No, thanks. I'm...

01:32:01.327 --> 01:32:02.726
- I'm good.
- I'm not good.

01:32:02.962 --> 01:32:04.395
You guys split it.

01:32:05.265 --> 01:32:07.256
You wanna split it? Fifty-fifty?

01:32:08.535 --> 01:32:10.298
Actually, I can't.

01:32:10.503 --> 01:32:13.904
Because I bet you 100 grand
that you couldn't catch a salmon

01:32:14.107 --> 01:32:16.302
with a flashlight and I lost.

01:32:16.543 --> 01:32:20.138
Besides, Tom, you got bills to pay.
You got a new life to start.

01:32:20.713 --> 01:32:21.702
I don't know what to say.

01:32:22.949 --> 01:32:24.250
Just say we're square.

01:32:25.751 --> 01:32:29.016
No, actually, we're not square.

01:32:30.222 --> 01:32:33.988
I seem to recall a certain part
of that wager being one left nut,

01:32:34.193 --> 01:32:36.525
and I'm gonna get it.
Come on, pleated pants, let's go.

01:32:36.729 --> 01:32:38.629
- Hey, Tom. Hey. Hey.
- Oh, no.

01:32:39.064 --> 01:32:40.531
Don't make me go in
through the throat.

01:32:40.733 --> 01:32:43.099
- I'm going through the throat.
- You said I could keep it.

01:32:43.302 --> 01:32:45.202
- No, I didn't.
- Tom, you said I could keep it.

01:32:45.571 --> 01:32:47.038
Jerry! Officer!

01:32:48.674 --> 01:32:51.268
<i>Hi. This is Jerry, and I can't
come to the phone right now,</i>

01:32:51.477 --> 01:32:54.446
<i>because I am busy trying
to convince the love of my life</i>

01:32:54.647 --> 01:32:55.807
<i>to give me another chance.</i>

01:32:56.015 --> 01:32:58.540
<i>And I will prove to her
that I grew up just enough</i>

01:32:58.751 --> 01:33:01.720
<i>to know that I want the responsibility,
day in and day out,</i>

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.945
<i>of being there for her
in this relationship,</i>

01:33:04.156 --> 01:33:07.648
<i>which I am hoping will someday
become marriage and kids</i>

01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:10.988
<i>and a long and unbelievably
happy life together.</i>

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:12.829
Hi, honey.

01:33:37.756 --> 01:33:40.224
So happy right now.

01:33:41.093 --> 01:33:45.029
That was really, really beautiful.

01:33:50.402 --> 01:33:54.099
- Will you get the light, hon?
- Oh, yeah.

01:33:56.608 --> 01:33:59.099
You're so good at that now.

01:34:01.313 --> 01:34:04.840
And then I jumped on the grenade
to save my buddies and...

01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:07.280
Blew my rib cage all to shit.

01:34:07.486 --> 01:34:09.613
Sent me 156 feet in the air.

01:34:09.822 --> 01:34:13.553
Then I went back and paid off
all my debts in full with D.B.'s money.

01:34:17.162 --> 01:34:18.288
One question.

01:34:19.665 --> 01:34:21.326
What's a downstairs?

01:34:22.305 --> 01:34:28.851
