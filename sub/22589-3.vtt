00:12.430 --> 00:16.267
<i>NARRATOR". Eleven o'clock in Gotham City
and all is well.</i>

00:16.476 --> 00:18.686
<i>Or is it?</i>

00:18.853 --> 00:22.941
<i>Criminals prefer plying their trade
under the cloak of darkness.</i>

00:23.149 --> 00:26.861
<i>And tonight is no exception.</i>

01:49.777 --> 01:52.614
A catalog taken from a department store.

01:52.822 --> 01:55.325
A catamaran taken from the nautical society.

01:55.533 --> 01:58.870
Three mittens taken from a fancy apartment. Ha!

01:59.912 --> 02:03.625
What, uh--?
What does that all spell out to you, O'Hara?

02:03.833 --> 02:09.380
T-R-O-U-B-L-E. Trouble.

02:09.589 --> 02:11.924
- The Princess of Plunder.
-Catwoman.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.052
The saints preserve us.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.013
When facing an adversary
like the Countess of Criminality...

02:17.180 --> 02:19.515
...there is only one man who can deal with...

02:19.724 --> 02:23.770
...and eventually overcome
that threat to our security.

02:29.359 --> 02:32.070
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, at stately Wayne Manor...</i>

02:32.278 --> 02:35.782
<i>...home of Bruce Wayne
and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson...</i>

02:35.990 --> 02:39.577
<i>...astronomical events are taking place.</i>

02:39.744 --> 02:42.205
Remember, Dick,
don't look directly into the sun.

02:42.372 --> 02:44.832
It may cause damage
to the retina of the eye.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.084
Right, Bruce.

02:46.292 --> 02:49.212
Gosh, isn't it exciting
about the eclipse tomorrow?

02:49.420 --> 02:52.048
A few countries are sending
geophysical teams...

02:52.256 --> 02:54.509
...to observe the phenomenon.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.224
- Ahem. Uh, sir'?
- Hmm?

03:01.432 --> 03:03.351
It's the Batphone.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.735
- Yes, commissioner?
- Batman.

03:12.944 --> 03:16.197
We have every reason to believe
that Catwoman is alive...

03:16.406 --> 03:18.324
...and living in Gotham City.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.201
We'll be right there, commissioner.

03:20.410 --> 03:24.914
Catwoman has returned to besmirch
the name of our fair metropolis.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.458
To the Bat Poles.

04:57.590 --> 05:02.178
"And the three mittens came from
the 10th floor apartment of Andrew S. Kitten."

05:02.345 --> 05:04.347
Ha. "Parent of triplets."

05:04.555 --> 05:06.474
- Gotham City's father of the year.
-Right.

05:06.682 --> 05:10.937
But there's one significant fact that
these crimes have, all three are cat-oriented.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.438
But what does it all mean?

05:12.647 --> 05:17.193
It means, Chief O'Hara, that Catwoman
has something big up her paw.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.947
However, this is only a portent
of crimes to come.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.783
The Marchioness of Misdemeanors
is a wily opponent.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.868
What'll we do?

05:26.077 --> 05:30.289
You'd set a thief to catch a thief,
you'd set some cheese to catch a mouse.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.292
To catch this breed of cat, you'd set...

05:33.459 --> 05:35.127
- A bird.
-Correct, Robin.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.338
And what kind of bird?

05:37.547 --> 05:38.756
A canary.

05:38.965 --> 05:40.800
You've done it again, old chap.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.593
I hope it works, Batman.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.387
She's a pretty hip cat.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.765
No matter how cunning and crafty they are,
Chief O'Hara...

05:47.974 --> 05:52.895
...eventually all criminals commit the same
error, over-confidence. Let's go, Robin.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.733
O'Hara...

05:59.193 --> 06:03.531
...I have grown to realize that there are
two basics in life we can be sure of.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.950
Death and taxes, sir?

06:06.367 --> 06:08.661
Batman and Robin.

06:10.246 --> 06:14.250
This woman is bright and clever.

06:14.458 --> 06:19.005
No matter how much she's involved
in her treacherous schemes...

06:19.213 --> 06:21.841
...she must keep in touch with reality.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.051
A false newspaper story.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.344
A few weeks ago...

06:25.511 --> 06:29.140
...I met the man who writes the most
widely-read gossip column in the country.

06:29.307 --> 06:31.559
<i>Jack O'Shea oi the Gotham City Times.</i>

06:31.767 --> 06:34.979
Right, a straight news plant
might be too conspicuous...

06:35.187 --> 06:39.150
...but a small blurb in his column...

06:39.358 --> 06:40.902
...might do the trick.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.070
Is he worthy of our trust?

06:43.279 --> 06:45.323
That's hard to determine, Robin.

06:45.531 --> 06:48.159
He's a bit too theatrical for me...

06:48.367 --> 06:51.329
...but we must make every effort
to bring Catwoman to justice.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.831
Are you gonna call him
at his newspaper office?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.667
This Jack O'Shea is rather unique.

06:56.876 --> 07:01.005
His office is the third phone booth
in Glob's drugstore.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.966
We should have the number
in the Bat index.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.356
Yeah, ring me tomorrow, Fred.

07:21.734 --> 07:23.152
Dolly.

07:23.361 --> 07:26.822
Hey, Poopsie, make me a corn beef on white,
heavy on the mayo.

07:27.031 --> 07:29.158
Two glasses of buttermilk.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.203
Your dime.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.038
Mr. O'Shea, this is Batman.

07:34.914 --> 07:35.957
Who?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.626
<i>We met several weeks ago
at the newspaper.</i>

07:38.834 --> 07:39.877
You're putting me on.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.088
I wonder, could you do me a favor?

07:42.296 --> 07:45.466
Come on, who is this really?
Hubbel, Leonard?

07:45.883 --> 07:47.927
This is really Batman.

07:48.386 --> 07:50.137
I'll be an out of work actor.

07:50.346 --> 07:52.390
Say, what can I do for you, Batman baby?

07:52.598 --> 07:54.600
Need a little free publicity? Ha!

07:54.976 --> 07:59.897
I'd like you to place an item in your column
about a rare species of canary...

08:00.106 --> 08:04.777
...that's being exhibited on the 12th floor
of the Gotham City Natural History Museum.

08:04.986 --> 08:07.738
Well, anything you say, Caped Crusader.

08:07.947 --> 08:10.908
Always glad to aid the Hooded Avenger.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.702
I appreciate that.

08:12.910 --> 08:15.621
Hey, why don't you and I have lunch
together sometime?

08:16.205 --> 08:17.957
Perhaps. Goodbye.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.836
See you around.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.886
You are the créme de la créme...

08:31.095 --> 08:33.347
...of Gotham City's cat burglars.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.851
So why did we have to waste our time
with those dumb robberies?

08:38.309 --> 08:41.105
- Unh!
-Never question my motives.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.650
Suffice it to say that 12 men
applied for this job.

08:44.859 --> 08:48.070
All the others washed out
when they were caught by the law.

08:48.654 --> 08:52.742
You proved your mettle
when you escaped unscathed.

08:53.284 --> 08:57.830
I am in the process of selecting cat burglars
for the greatest caper...

08:58.039 --> 09:01.125
...in crimedom's history.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.377
So, what is it already?

09:03.753 --> 09:05.588
In due time.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.798
In due time.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.024
Speak.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.609
<i>O' SHEA".
Catwoman, sweetheart.</i>

09:27.068 --> 09:28.694
What's shaking, baby?

09:28.903 --> 09:32.364
Watch your language, knave.
Remember, I'm a lady.

09:33.199 --> 09:35.117
Yeah. Right.

09:35.326 --> 09:38.788
Well, I've got some news
that ought to raise the fur on your back.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.957
The Batman has arranged a trap.

09:42.166 --> 09:46.170
There's a rare canary on the 12th floor
of the Gotham City Natural History Museum.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.965
<i>I guess he figured you'd want to, uh, steal it.</i>

09:51.509 --> 09:54.095
My, is that so?

09:54.303 --> 09:57.890
Good going, my perfidious printsman.
Keep in touch.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.391
Yeah.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.229
Hey, why don't we get together
and share a saucer of milk sometime?

10:03.854 --> 10:05.106
Don't be ridiculous.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.858
It would ravage my reputation
if I were seen with you.

10:10.986 --> 10:13.697
Nobody wants to eat with me.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.616
Now.

10:17.076 --> 10:18.702
Pay attention.

10:19.370 --> 10:22.248
It's time for your lesson in window-jimmying.

10:30.172 --> 10:33.259
After this, we'll have a short recess...

10:33.467 --> 10:37.596
...and discuss Batman and Robin's
upcoming funeral.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.310
- Are those the Batjets you told me about?
-Yes, Robin.

10:43.519 --> 10:48.149
Each one contains enough compressed
bat-jection to lift a 5000 pound automobile...

10:48.357 --> 10:50.985
...more than 500 miles in the air.

10:51.193 --> 10:56.949
We haven't tested them yet,
but we may have to use them eventually.

10:57.158 --> 10:59.577
Batman, you think of everything.

10:59.785 --> 11:03.539
- Remember, the Boy Scouts' motto?
-Be prepared.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.083
It would do well
to keep that in mind at all times.

11:06.292 --> 11:09.211
I took the liberty, sir,
of preparing you both a snack.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.298
How thoughtful, Alfred,
but we must be gone.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.924
Crime waits for no one.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.635
Oh, but surely, sir,
you'll take some nourishment.

11:16.844 --> 11:21.140
It's not conducive to good health to fight
the forces of evil without proper supplies.

11:21.307 --> 11:25.186
Ah. As they say,
an army travels on its stomach.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.645
Indeed, sir.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.481
Uh, I anticipated your haste.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.234
- I provided this sack.
-Ah.

11:32.443 --> 11:35.237
Uh, it's always been my motto: "be prepared."

11:35.613 --> 11:37.198
Truer words were never spoken.

11:37.406 --> 11:40.618
And if I may say so, sir,
where are you off to?

11:41.243 --> 11:43.787
The Gotham City Natural History Museum.

11:43.996 --> 11:47.875
And we must get there pronto
before Catwoman.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.944
- If my calculations are correct...
-They usually are.

12:15.152 --> 12:19.365
...someone should be coming through
that window within the next six seconds.

12:19.573 --> 12:23.869
Six, five, four...

12:25.537 --> 12:26.622
You were right.

12:39.009 --> 12:42.179
Don't make a move, you light-fingered
larcenist, consider yourself apprehended.

12:42.388 --> 12:44.974
Now wait a second, Batman and Robin.

12:45.182 --> 12:48.102
Is that fair, two against one?

12:48.310 --> 12:51.438
You're big, important crime fighters...

12:51.647 --> 12:55.067
...and I'm just a lowly cat burglar...

12:55.276 --> 13:00.281
...trying to eke out a living
in this dog-eat-dog world.

13:00.614 --> 13:04.410
I'd hoped the Catwoman herself
might materialize here tonight.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.705
If you'd just look behind you,
you'll see that she did.

13:07.913 --> 13:11.166
Holy cliche.
Does he expect us to fall for that?

13:11.333 --> 13:15.587
Ah, my tenacious teenager,
you have a lot to learn.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.464
You witch.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.675
Batman, with all your many attributes...

13:19.842 --> 13:22.261
...you haven't learned the first thing
about manners.

13:22.428 --> 13:25.097
A gentleman would kiss a lady's hand.

13:25.556 --> 13:27.975
You are not a lady. You are a--

13:28.142 --> 13:30.269
Hss! Curb your tongue, Batman.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.855
I cannot tolerate a man with no breeding.

13:33.063 --> 13:36.108
All right, cats, get them.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.908
Enough.Enough!

14:26.116 --> 14:28.577
Cease this fiddle-dee-dee.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.538
- Are you ready to capitulate?
- Heavens forbid.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.291
I just don't see the reason
for any further violence.

14:34.500 --> 14:38.879
Especially since my side is losing.

14:39.088 --> 14:40.506
Holy weaponry.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.549
Look what she's got in her paws.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.676
I've got you covered with my cat darts.

14:45.010 --> 14:49.556
They've been dipped in catatonic,
just enough to paralyze you for a minute or so.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.644
Holy D'Artagnan.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.064
You've made your point.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.900
Unh. What is she going to do with us?

15:00.567 --> 15:05.656
You can be sure her intentions
are not honorable.

15:06.824 --> 15:09.618
I'm gonna throw you out that window.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.620
Twelve floors straight down.

15:11.829 --> 15:14.331
I hope you enjoy your flight.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.375
Do the deed
and be quick about it.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.378
I hate long goodbyes.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.854
I don't believe it.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.440
What rotten luck.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.698
Put on your cat suits,
let's get out of here.

15:47.906 --> 15:50.117
The fuzz will be stepping on our tails.

15:50.284 --> 15:53.996
Lucky we had Captain Ahab of the White
Whaling Company put up these fishnets...

15:54.204 --> 15:57.082
...to catch the canary cage
she might've tossed out the window.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.418
These nets sure saved our lives.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.753
Not luck, Robin, we were prepared.

16:01.962 --> 16:06.675
But it is true,
some days one is luckier than others.

16:09.928 --> 16:15.017
I really hate to do this.
This may give the caretaker quite a shock.

16:16.602 --> 16:21.648
"Gotham City's much beloved crime busters
blew the duke last night...

16:21.857 --> 16:25.360
...when they allowed the Viscountess
of Venality to escape their...

16:25.569 --> 16:27.237
...bumbling efforts.

16:27.446 --> 16:32.242
Now the question is,
have the dynamic Caped Crusaders...

16:32.451 --> 16:34.703
...fallen on their masks?"

16:34.912 --> 16:37.873
What a scathing denunciation.
Why would O'Shea be so vitriolic?

16:38.081 --> 16:41.668
Here's the one spalpeen we caught
last night after the others got away.

16:41.877 --> 16:44.171
- He's all yours, Batman.
-Thank you, Chief O'Hara.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.215
You might as well spill it.

16:46.423 --> 16:52.137
You can kick me, hit me and stomp me,
but I'll never talk.

16:52.346 --> 16:53.514
All right, I'll talk.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.016
- Where's Catwoman's lair?
- I don't know.

16:56.225 --> 16:58.936
They pick me up at my swank
one room apartment...

16:59.144 --> 17:01.605
...blindfold me,
then take me to her place.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.649
Any clues as to where it is?

17:03.857 --> 17:07.194
All I know is that I heard
rock 'n' roll music in the background...

17:07.361 --> 17:09.195
...whenever I go to one of her lectures.

17:09.363 --> 17:12.156
Lessons in larceny. How despicable.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.453
And I used to hear a lot of people
marching on the floor above my head.

17:16.662 --> 17:21.165
With a bunch of cats meowing
whenever the music stopped. Heh-heh.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.296
Oh, yeah, one other thing.

17:26.505 --> 17:30.175
Whatever her caper is,
she plans it for tonight.

17:30.384 --> 17:33.679
- Very well. Take him away, Chief O'Hara.
-Come on.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.391
It's 10 a.m.

17:37.558 --> 17:41.103
If we're to figure out her plot,
we better shake a boot. Let's go.

17:53.407 --> 17:56.535
Come on, Alfred, it's easy.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.037
Don't be an old fuddy-duddy.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.791
I'm afraid my dancing days ended
with the Lambeth Walk, madam.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.003
Doctor's orders, you know, war injury.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.005
Heavens.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.723
Oh, boy. I like rock 'n' roll music...

18:17.931 --> 18:20.976
...as much as the next red-blooded
average American teenager...

18:21.184 --> 18:23.645
...but this stuff is awful.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.482
It's the latest dance.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.610
They call it the Cattuzzi.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.362
By Benedict Arnold and the Traitors.

18:33.572 --> 18:37.743
It started a couple of weeks ago
at a new restaurant on the west side...

18:37.951 --> 18:40.370
...called the Pink Sandbox.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.278
What are your specialties?

19:13.487 --> 19:16.990
Catburgers with catsup,
Chicken Cat-atore...

19:17.157 --> 19:21.286
...and various cuts of meat
from choice Kansas City cattle.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.872
If you'll come back in a moment,
we'll give you our orders.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.499
All right.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.626
Holy epicure.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.795
Using this restaurant as a cover-up.

19:29.961 --> 19:32.339
Oh, she's smart all right.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.842
But this time we'll turn the tables on her.

19:41.431 --> 19:45.727
You were right, Robin,
this must be the place.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.859
The early cat catches the Batman.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.364
Don't bother, Batman.

19:57.531 --> 20:01.118
This glass is shatter-proof,
bulletproof and bat-proof.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.953
What are we gonna do, Batman?

20:03.161 --> 20:04.371
What are you gonna do?

20:04.788 --> 20:07.457
You're gonna die.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.502
I'm not just pussyfooting around
this time, Batman.

20:10.836 --> 20:14.798
You can't frighten us with any
of your threats, you feline Sorceress.

20:15.006 --> 20:18.760
Take heed, we shall overcome
your satanic schemes.

20:18.927 --> 20:23.557
If we weren't on opposite sides of the law,
Batman, I could go for you...

20:23.765 --> 20:25.934
...in a small way.

20:26.143 --> 20:30.981
You're about the only man I've met lately
who'd be worthy of me.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.483
Holy lovebirds,
I think she's sweet on you, Batman.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.154
The Joker called for a date last Monday.

20:37.738 --> 20:39.906
He's fairly attractive.

20:40.115 --> 20:43.034
But I can't stand his green hair.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.829
And the Penguin's too small for me.

20:46.037 --> 20:49.499
Your problem is you've been
running around with a bad crowd.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.585
Enough of this moralizing, Batman.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.546
Nobody likes a preaching crime fighter.

20:54.755 --> 20:55.964
Batman and Robin...

20:56.590 --> 20:59.009
...your time has come.

20:59.676 --> 21:04.973
Prepare thyselves for the hotfoot
to end all hot feet.

21:05.307 --> 21:10.020
Charlie, switch it on.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.824
Look at them dance, boys.

21:22.991 --> 21:28.580
It's amazing how two such athletic
human beings can be so ungainly.

21:42.803 --> 21:46.723
We've gotta cool this floor down,
or our feet will be severely burned.

21:46.932 --> 21:48.850
Holy bunions.

21:49.059 --> 21:51.603
Look, there's a water pipe.

22:00.862 --> 22:04.699
Little do they know
that pipe contains liquid catatonia.

22:04.908 --> 22:08.578
Fumes will drive them batty
and knock them temporarily out.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.559
Wake up, you birdies.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.936
I wouldn't want you to make your exits...

22:33.353 --> 22:36.565
...without knowing exactly
how it's to be done.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.775
You hateful hussy.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.778
The reflectors have been greased
with margarine...

22:41.945 --> 22:43.363
...to make you all the more...

22:44.865 --> 22:47.075
...fryable.

22:47.284 --> 22:48.743
Holy oleo.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.787
I didn't know you could yodel.

22:50.996 --> 22:55.292
- Have you no semblance of decency?
-Not a shred.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.460
Thomas, Charles...

22:57.669 --> 23:00.505
...bring over the piéce de résistance.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.182
Hot enough for you, Batman?

23:11.391 --> 23:13.643
You two guys are really hot stuff.

23:14.019 --> 23:17.647
Two minutes under this blistering
heat and you'll be very well-done indeed.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.609
It's too bad it had to end now, guys...

23:20.817 --> 23:24.362
...but look at it this way,
you will have starred in a new show.

23:24.571 --> 23:25.655
What's that?

23:25.864 --> 23:27.782
<i>Bat on a Hot Tin Roof.</i>

23:31.328 --> 23:33.371
That's not a bit funny.

23:33.580 --> 23:37.500
Well, you never did have
much of a sense of humor, anyhow.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.879
Farewell. Farewell.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.547
I must depart...

23:42.756 --> 23:46.092
...and muster my forces
for the final assault on Mount Gotham.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.804
At most, you have a few scant minutes...

23:50.013 --> 23:52.265
...before you either choke to death...

23:52.474 --> 23:57.020
...or get one of the worst cases
of sunburn in history.
