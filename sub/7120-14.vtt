WEBVTT

00:07.569 --> 00:09.708
The goblins have suffered
long enough, Xergiok!

00:09.771 --> 00:10.807
Shush!

00:10.873 --> 00:12.580
You guys can't live
without me, right?

00:12.642 --> 00:13.849
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:13.911 --> 00:14.787
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

00:14.845 --> 00:16.187
You got problems, man.

00:16.245 --> 00:17.246
Bah!

00:22.054 --> 00:23.659
♪ Wands are for wimps! ♪

00:27.295 --> 00:29.434
You may have beaten
me this time, but...

00:29.498 --> 00:30.602
Ow!

00:30.666 --> 00:32.668
Ha ha! Yeah!

00:33.870 --> 00:35.782
And stay out, muffin top!

00:41.213 --> 00:42.318
Finn and Jake!

00:42.381 --> 00:45.055
Finn and Jake! Finn and Jake!

00:45.119 --> 00:48.123
Nyah, great job, warriors.

00:48.188 --> 00:49.930
You've freed us.

00:49.991 --> 00:53.269
I am Gummy, Royal
Goblin Chief of staff.

00:53.329 --> 00:55.503
Nice to meet you.

00:55.565 --> 00:57.169
Nyah!

00:57.234 --> 00:58.680
I-I-I'm sorry.

00:58.736 --> 01:01.946
I have not known a friendly
touch in some time.

01:02.007 --> 01:05.683
You see, Xergiok loved
to be a jerk to us.

01:05.745 --> 01:08.522
It's spankin' time!

01:08.582 --> 01:10.358
Yea-a-a-a-h!

01:10.418 --> 01:12.864
Yeah!

01:16.092 --> 01:17.367
Yea-a-a-a-a-h!

01:17.427 --> 01:19.874
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:19.931 --> 01:21.376
Aw, heck, Maria.

01:21.432 --> 01:23.709
I need to ask you something.

01:23.769 --> 01:26.273
Do you want to do this
marriage thing with me?

01:26.339 --> 01:27.374
Aww!

01:27.440 --> 01:30.081
Oh, my love, the answer is yes.

01:30.144 --> 01:31.144
Boom!

01:33.549 --> 01:34.823
Congratulations.

01:34.883 --> 01:35.883
Oh!

01:37.453 --> 01:41.926
W-we need a good King to
rule us, like you, mayhaps?

01:41.993 --> 01:42.835
Oh, yeah!

01:42.894 --> 01:43.929
You should do it!

01:43.995 --> 01:45.373
Yeah, be their King.

01:45.431 --> 01:46.432
No, man.

01:46.499 --> 01:48.605
I'm an Adventurer fo' life.

01:48.669 --> 01:52.277
If there isn't a King to
tell me not to start a riot,

01:52.340 --> 01:54.446
I-I could start a riot, then.

01:54.510 --> 01:55.818
No rules, baby!

01:55.878 --> 01:57.050
Start that riot!

01:58.782 --> 02:01.730
Riot! Flip this table!

02:01.786 --> 02:03.391
No one can tell me no!

02:03.455 --> 02:04.627
Aah!

02:04.690 --> 02:07.695
Please, Finn. We need a King!

02:09.495 --> 02:10.633
Stop the riot!

02:12.132 --> 02:15.842
I'll become your King... to
save y'all from yourselves.

02:15.905 --> 02:18.852
We have a new King!

02:20.244 --> 02:24.022
Hey, Finn's gonna need a Queen.

02:24.082 --> 02:25.083
I'll do it.

02:26.986 --> 02:30.594
Allow me to show you the
grounds, your Majesties.

02:30.657 --> 02:32.399
Show me what we got, Gummy.

02:32.460 --> 02:33.803
Show it to me!

02:33.861 --> 02:34.966
Dude, I'm psyched!

02:35.030 --> 02:36.634
Yeah.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.543
The Goblin Birthing
Pits, your majesties.

02:39.602 --> 02:42.675
I'm being born!

02:42.740 --> 02:44.118
That's pretty neat.

02:44.175 --> 02:47.214
The Garden of Living Fountains.

02:47.279 --> 02:48.815
Whoo! Awesome!

02:48.881 --> 02:53.855
The Royal Game Archive,
complete with controller hats.

02:53.921 --> 02:55.867
Ooh!

02:55.923 --> 02:58.700
The Royal Dragon Stables.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.366
Oh!

03:01.398 --> 03:02.604
Whoa.

03:02.666 --> 03:07.708
And, finally, the royal bedroom,
with king-sized bed for

03:07.773 --> 03:08.773
the royal couple.

03:08.807 --> 03:10.549
Could you make that a bunk bed?

03:10.610 --> 03:12.146
Yes, my Queen.

03:12.212 --> 03:13.452
Whisper Dan!

03:18.019 --> 03:19.693
I call the top!

03:19.755 --> 03:20.597
And I call...

03:20.656 --> 03:21.727
Wait!

03:21.792 --> 03:25.297
For you, great King, the
book of royal rules.

03:25.363 --> 03:27.775
Mm. Sounds boring.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.608
Oh, no worries, my Liege.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.706
I'll read it to you.

03:31.771 --> 03:32.875
Hey, Jake.

03:32.939 --> 03:34.619
You want to stay awake
and hear some rules?

03:40.416 --> 03:42.794
All right, lay it on me, Gummy.

03:42.852 --> 03:48.304
"Introduction, colon, the 623
royal rules were established

03:48.360 --> 03:53.971
in Moon Year 16, in response to
elder Gorflox's repeated request

03:54.034 --> 03:57.710
for an organized response..."

03:57.772 --> 03:59.878
Awaken, your highness!

03:59.942 --> 04:01.819
No way, dude.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.427
Your Excellency, let's go.

04:05.483 --> 04:06.928
We have much to do.

04:06.984 --> 04:08.429
Whoo!

04:08.487 --> 04:12.766
This is where you may perform
your daily processes, my King.

04:12.825 --> 04:15.102
Whoa!

04:15.162 --> 04:16.937
Look at that huge mirror!

04:16.997 --> 04:20.002
And it's painted baby blue...
Boys style!

04:20.067 --> 04:21.844
Come, Sire.

04:21.904 --> 04:23.383
It is time to brush your teeth

04:23.439 --> 04:26.080
in front of the "boys
style" mirror.

04:26.143 --> 04:27.646
Whoo! Awesome!

04:29.046 --> 04:30.190
Oh, no, no, no, your majesty!

04:30.214 --> 04:32.354
Please! Let us brush your teeth!

04:32.418 --> 04:33.523
Kyah!

04:33.586 --> 04:34.690
Whoa, ease up, dudes.

04:34.754 --> 04:36.199
Finn access only.

04:36.256 --> 04:38.294
Aah! He's a rule breaker!

04:38.359 --> 04:40.135
Don't spank us too hard!

04:40.195 --> 04:41.765
Spare them, your majesty!

04:41.830 --> 04:43.538
Spank me instead!

04:43.599 --> 04:45.476
Set my buttocks ablaze!

04:45.535 --> 04:47.607
Guys, what are you
talking about?

04:47.671 --> 04:51.176
Rule one, "the King shall
not brush his own teeth,"

04:51.242 --> 04:54.588
in the book of royal rules
I read to you last night.

04:54.647 --> 04:56.650
Oh! Oh.

04:56.716 --> 04:58.754
Guys, put your hams away.

04:58.820 --> 04:59.924
Wha?!

04:59.987 --> 05:01.660
I'm not gonna spank your hams.

05:01.723 --> 05:03.259
I'm not that kind of King.

05:03.325 --> 05:07.672
So, then, we may brush
your teeth, my Lord?

05:07.730 --> 05:10.644
You can brush my teeth I guess.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.272
Yay!

05:12.337 --> 05:13.543
Oh.

05:14.874 --> 05:16.148
This brunch looks great.

05:16.209 --> 05:17.382
Can't wait to dig in.

05:17.444 --> 05:20.323
Uh, I will out that,
your highness.

05:20.380 --> 05:24.125
Gummy, as King, I order
you to let me out it.

05:24.186 --> 05:25.688
I'm sorry, Sire.

05:25.754 --> 05:28.361
The royal rules don't allow it.

05:28.425 --> 05:29.597
I'm cutting it, Gummy!

05:29.659 --> 05:30.661
No!

05:33.098 --> 05:34.475
Thank you, Gummy.

05:34.533 --> 05:37.014
Uh, a thousand pardons, my Lord.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.050
You're not going to
chew that, are you?

05:39.105 --> 05:40.517
Yeah.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.780
I'm sorry, Sire.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.880
The royal rules don't allow it.

05:43.945 --> 05:45.424
Gummy, just let me do this.

05:45.481 --> 05:46.653
No one will know.

05:46.716 --> 05:47.820
I would know.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:56.729 --> 05:59.074
Uh, Jake, this is nuts.

05:59.132 --> 06:02.205
Maybe, but rules are rules.

06:04.105 --> 06:06.450
Master, eat your food.

06:06.508 --> 06:09.285
I chewed it thoroughly and
heated it to goblin body

06:09.345 --> 06:10.415
temperature.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.858
I'm not hungry, Gummy.

06:11.916 --> 06:13.361
You look a little bit down.

06:13.417 --> 06:15.398
Would you like me
to weep for you?

06:15.453 --> 06:16.865
No, Gummy. It's just...

06:17.823 --> 06:18.961
Sire! Sire!

06:19.025 --> 06:20.562
There's trouble in Town Square!

06:20.627 --> 06:21.571
A thief!

06:21.628 --> 06:23.336
A thief? Yes!

06:23.398 --> 06:24.502
I'll handle it!

06:24.566 --> 06:25.806
No, sire!

06:25.867 --> 06:28.007
The King is not
allowed to fight.

06:28.070 --> 06:30.142
He must give a
speech to the thief.

06:30.207 --> 06:32.552
That is the royal
rule, my Liege.

06:35.279 --> 06:36.554
There's the thief!

06:36.615 --> 06:38.322
Give me them hot buns, Lady!

06:38.383 --> 06:39.383
Hey, thief!

06:41.688 --> 06:43.965
I got a speech for yo... no!

06:44.024 --> 06:46.665
The royal speaker
must give the speech.

06:46.728 --> 06:47.729
What?!

06:47.796 --> 06:48.867
You see?

06:50.366 --> 06:54.407
Since the dawn of time, the
balance of what is right and

06:54.472 --> 06:56.349
what is wrong has
come into question...

06:56.407 --> 06:58.115
I'll take this.

06:58.177 --> 07:00.920
Yes, you can feel it
slowly working, eh?

07:00.981 --> 07:02.585
Oh, no! Aah!

07:02.649 --> 07:04.857
I can't let this go on!

07:04.919 --> 07:05.863
Gimme!

07:05.920 --> 07:07.025
Hands off, thief!

07:08.023 --> 07:08.899
Ha!

07:08.957 --> 07:09.867
Here you go, old lady.

07:09.925 --> 07:11.496
Oh, no! The new King!

07:11.561 --> 07:13.303
Just as cruel as the last King.

07:13.364 --> 07:14.968
Hi... Yo... what?

07:15.032 --> 07:18.480
Oh, King, we beg you not
to slay the old lady.

07:18.536 --> 07:20.380
Don't hurt us!

07:20.439 --> 07:21.474
No, wait!

07:21.540 --> 07:22.611
Don't slay me!

07:22.676 --> 07:24.349
You may keep the hot
buns, your majesty!

07:24.411 --> 07:25.652
I'm ready for my spanking,

07:25.713 --> 07:27.021
Mr. Xergiok part two.

07:27.081 --> 07:29.255
We're ready for our
spanking, Sire!

07:31.153 --> 07:34.795
♪ I just want to help
y'all as much as I can ♪

07:34.858 --> 07:39.138

Aah!

07:58.489 --> 07:59.695
Gummy, don't be afraid.

07:59.757 --> 08:01.236
I'm gonna stick to
the rules now, okay?

08:01.260 --> 08:04.037
My Lord, I'm sorry,
y-you haven't heard?

08:04.097 --> 08:07.238
Xergiok is returning
with an evil army!

08:07.301 --> 08:09.805
Come look... through the scope.

08:09.871 --> 08:11.475
You see?

08:14.544 --> 08:17.151
Prepare to destroy them all!

08:17.214 --> 08:18.352
Oh!

08:19.851 --> 08:23.299
If I defeat Xergiok as King, I
can prove to the goblins that an

08:23.355 --> 08:25.063
active King can be a good King.

08:25.125 --> 08:28.505
But I can't let them know
until it's all over.

08:28.563 --> 08:30.167
Stay fainted, Gummy.

08:30.231 --> 08:31.506
Oh!

08:31.567 --> 08:33.808
Whisper Dan, have you seen Jake?

08:35.739 --> 08:37.275
I'm in here.

08:37.340 --> 08:40.982
Xergiok's back with an
army of earclopses.

08:41.046 --> 08:42.821
Let's bust them up!

08:44.317 --> 08:45.489
All right, man.

08:45.551 --> 08:46.825
How do we do this?

08:46.886 --> 08:48.093
Hmm.

08:50.792 --> 08:51.964
What if they figure it out?

08:52.026 --> 08:53.026
No way, man.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.301
I'm going to be honest
with you, King Finn.

08:56.366 --> 08:59.576
When I'm scared, I feel
most safe in your lap.

09:03.976 --> 09:08.153
Line up for your
spankings, Goblins!

09:08.214 --> 09:10.320
Oh! Too late... In my pants!

09:10.384 --> 09:13.298
Jake, the goblins can't
see me being un-Kingly.

09:13.355 --> 09:14.834
I need a disguise.

09:14.890 --> 09:15.961
Jump in my mouth!

09:17.126 --> 09:18.504
Yah!

09:18.562 --> 09:23.808
Who among you has the
courage to face Xergiok?!

09:23.868 --> 09:26.110
Shut your kissing hole, Xergiok!

09:26.172 --> 09:28.050
It's time for a beating!

09:28.108 --> 09:31.215
I salute you, foolish warrior!

09:31.279 --> 09:32.917
You can be my personal sla...

09:33.882 --> 09:35.225
Whoa! Whoa!

09:39.622 --> 09:45.597
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow!

09:45.664 --> 09:47.076
How in the world?!

09:47.133 --> 09:50.946
Dude, no one uses earclopses
in battle without earplugs.

09:53.641 --> 09:54.676
Eat this!

09:55.778 --> 09:57.223
Pow! Pow! Pow!

09:57.279 --> 09:59.851
Whoa!

09:59.916 --> 10:02.090
Ha ha! You missed me!

10:14.903 --> 10:16.849
Oh, great King.

10:16.905 --> 10:18.681
With the help of
a brave soldier,

10:18.741 --> 10:21.382
you thwarted the evil Xergiok.

10:21.445 --> 10:24.427
Huzzah!

10:26.684 --> 10:28.631
Come on, dude.

10:28.687 --> 10:29.961
Let's get out of here.

10:30.022 --> 10:31.161
Aww.

10:31.224 --> 10:32.669
All right.

10:32.726 --> 10:34.846
Well, looks like they got the
King they wanted, buddy.
