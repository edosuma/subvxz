because our special forces

prevent the attack

take out all incoming rockets.

09:32.441 --> 09:35.618
in our pivot away
from the global war on terror

09:35.662 --> 09:38.012
and toward great power
competition?

09:38.055 --> 09:39.709
It argues against going all in

09:39.753 --> 09:41.885
on cyber and
disinformation tactics

09:41.929 --> 09:44.018
at the expense
of conventional forces,

09:44.061 --> 09:45.802
who have already
been left ill-equipped

09:45.846 --> 09:47.935
after two decades
of narrow-minded focus

09:47.978 --> 09:50.067
on spec ops and expensive tech.

09:50.111 --> 09:53.462
The advantage to cyber
and disinformation tactics

09:53.505 --> 09:56.813
is the reduced risk
to our troops on the ground,

09:56.857 --> 09:59.424
both spec ops and conventional.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.643
But war remains kinetic.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.949
With Russia's invasion
of Ukraine

10:01.992 --> 10:04.081
and China poised to move
on Taiwan any minute,

10:04.125 --> 10:06.823
we need to ask ourselves
if the U.S. were attacked,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.651
would we really continue to rely

10:08.695 --> 10:10.871
on a select few
special operators

10:10.914 --> 10:13.134
to defend our whole nation?

have teeth yet,

It's still a trip, but

10:38.507 --> 10:41.466
it's a little less freaky
thanks to this mirror therapy.

-Good.

to see the team.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.087
They've come by
since you got back.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.436
I think that he means
all of them

10:54.479 --> 10:55.872
at the same out in the world.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.787

I've been avoiding them.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.313

like, three times a week,

11:09.364 --> 11:11.322
All I've been doing these
past couple months is wait.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.020
You know, to come home
from the hospital,

11:13.063 --> 11:15.762
for the incision to heal, to get
fitted for the prosthetic.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.374

at each other?

18:33.460 --> 18:35.157
might be different
than I expected,

18:35.201 --> 18:36.463
still moving towards
the same target.

18:36.506 --> 18:37.464
-Green Team.
-For now,

18:37.507 --> 18:38.769
then we'll see, you know?

18:38.813 --> 18:40.510
Wouldn't be the first guy
to operate again

18:40.554 --> 18:42.860
-after losing a limb.
-Just don't overdo it.

18:42.904 --> 18:46.429
All those surgeries.
Healing hurts, man.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.431
I'm not touching
the painkillers.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.390
You know, I saw with Swanny that

18:50.433 --> 18:52.000
the cure can be worse
than the problem.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.742
I got a good support system
between Stella and Bravo.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.659
That's good. How's she,
uh, handling all this?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.226
She's the strongest person
I know.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.662
Ah.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.320
Though I overheard her
on the phone with her mom

19:07.363 --> 19:09.148
saying that, you know,

19:09.191 --> 19:11.237
whenever she gets a little
overwhelmed by everything,

19:11.280 --> 19:12.629
she reminds herself
to be relieved that

19:12.673 --> 19:14.153
she doesn't
have to worry about me

19:14.196 --> 19:17.634
-being killed in battle anymore.
-[sighs]

19:17.678 --> 19:19.549
Look, uh...

19:21.116 --> 19:23.510
Everything you're going through

19:23.553 --> 19:25.903
is, uh...

19:25.947 --> 19:27.166
I'm sorry.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.517
You're saying that
like you blame yourself.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.519
Well, you know, you lost
your leg because of me.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.522
If I'd dealt with my head...

19:35.565 --> 19:38.177
when that building
came down in Mali,

19:38.220 --> 19:39.656
there's-there's no way

19:39.700 --> 19:41.658
you would have been with Bravo
on this ambush.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.879
You would've been back home like
you planned with your family.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.228
Like, you-you...

19:46.272 --> 19:47.969
you want to think
of yourself as the master

19:48.012 --> 19:49.492
of everyone's universe.

19:49.536 --> 19:52.060
Well, see it this way.
It helped me feel better, too.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.845
If not for you, my picture

19:54.889 --> 19:56.847
would be up there,
Stella would be a widow

19:56.891 --> 19:58.675
and Brian would
never know his father.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.721
You ended that fight and
you got me out of there alive.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.726
There's more to life
than operating.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.513
[bottles clink]

20:10.557 --> 20:12.341
Rooms for short-term housing,

20:12.385 --> 20:15.301
long-term housing,
a medical clinic.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.041
Kitchen, probably a chow hall.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.087
You really think there's a place
around here that has all this?

20:19.130 --> 20:20.480
If there isn't, we'll make one.

20:20.523 --> 20:21.698
We're not gonna be another group

20:21.742 --> 20:23.439
cutting corners
at vets' expense.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.006
Well, if the broker
tells us we have to settle,

20:25.049 --> 20:27.530
it's good to know you've
already got your speech prepped.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.010
-Yeah.
-Look at you.

20:29.053 --> 20:32.274
-Let me see. Look at you.
-[phone vibrates]

20:37.148 --> 20:39.412
[sighs] It's work.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.283
I didn't want
to miss this one, baby.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.633
I can handle a couple of
real estate showings on my own.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.331
Of course you can, I just...

20:46.593 --> 20:48.464
I wish I could
be there with you.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.597
This is our project.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.207
-Our dream.
-That's true, whether

20:52.251 --> 20:54.688
you're in Virginia Beach or some
highly-classified location.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.647
We're in this together. Bye.

21:01.869 --> 21:02.957
[door opens]

21:03.000 --> 21:04.263
DAVIS:
The Navy destroyer

21:04.306 --> 21:06.265
U.S.S. Crampton
was hit yesterday

21:06.308 --> 21:08.223
with three
Russian Kornet rockets

21:08.267 --> 21:10.747
while stationed off of the
Mediterranean coast of Turkey.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.836
20 American sailors
were killed in the attack.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.751
Biggest haymaker
thrown at us in years.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.449
-Who's taking credit?
-DAVIS: Nobody yet,

21:16.492 --> 21:18.581
but it has
all the hallmarks of ISIS.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.758
Well, reaching out and touching
some ISIS dirtbags

21:21.802 --> 21:23.412
may actually, uh, help Bravo

21:23.456 --> 21:24.761
get their groove back.

21:24.805 --> 21:25.980
SOTO: Alpha and Foxtrot
will be hitting

21:26.023 --> 21:27.068
targets in the region that

21:27.111 --> 21:27.982
may yield the trigger-pullers.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.984
So why are we here?

21:30.027 --> 21:31.768
Intel has determined that
the Kornets used in the attack

21:31.812 --> 21:33.466
were supplied by an arms dealer

21:33.509 --> 21:36.077
operating out of the port
of Sukhumi, Georgia,

21:36.120 --> 21:38.775
most likely skimmed from
Russia's campaign in Ukraine.

21:38.819 --> 21:41.517
Bravo will infiltrate
the arms depot,

21:41.561 --> 21:43.084
capture the traffickers,

21:43.127 --> 21:44.694
conduct an SSE for intel

21:44.738 --> 21:46.566
and disable the remaining
cache of weapons.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.002
Well, that's in Abkhazia.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.309
Russia-backed
separatist region of Georgia.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.398
Their dispute goes back
to the end of the Soviet Union.

21:52.441 --> 21:53.790
Don't they all?

21:53.834 --> 21:55.749
DAVIS: The Sukhumi Seaport
is roughly 45

21:55.792 --> 21:58.795
klicks south of the
7th Military Base in Gudauta,

21:58.839 --> 22:02.146
home to over 4,000
Russian and Abkhaz troops.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.713
So, goes without saying,

22:03.757 --> 22:05.324
if they even catch
a whiff of Bravo...

22:05.367 --> 22:07.151
JASON: American boots hitting
a Russian-occupied

22:07.195 --> 22:09.502
target on the Black Sea--

22:09.545 --> 22:11.895
mistakes, they just
lead to World War III.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.512
Cannot stay long
in the contested region.

22:19.555 --> 22:20.991
That's why we're diving.
In and out.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.516
C-17 can't get anywhere near
Russian airspace.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.952
We'll run a duck.

22:24.995 --> 22:27.128
Jump from Bulgarian airspace
with a Zodiac.

22:27.171 --> 22:30.174
Take it as far as we can
into international waters,

22:30.218 --> 22:31.480
swim the rest of the way in.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.569
That's four to six
hours underwater.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.005
Welcome back.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.181
RAY: We can have an agency team
standing by

22:37.225 --> 22:38.487
to collect the arms dealers

22:38.531 --> 22:39.662
before we swim back
to the Zodiac.

22:39.706 --> 22:40.924
That's optimistic, being that

22:40.968 --> 22:42.839
we're gonna be shark bait
for 12 hours,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.538
and considering
Bravo's hits lately,

22:45.581 --> 22:47.017
I'm not sure that
I want to tempt fate.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.671
How are we gonna
take out the rockets?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.631
Stack 'em and blow 'em.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.023
TRENT:
Sukhumi's heavily populated.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.808
We can't risk
civilian casualties.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.505
If we control the explosion,

22:56.549 --> 22:57.854
we can minimize
the blast radius.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.160
RAY:
Still, that boom is gonna

22:59.203 --> 23:00.379
draw a lot of eyes in an area

23:00.422 --> 23:01.684
with Russian troop presence.

23:01.728 --> 23:02.859
Which is why
we'll be in the water

23:02.903 --> 23:04.687
while those fuses are going off.

23:04.731 --> 23:07.473
They won't know what hit them.
Easy day, boys. Let's go.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.998
Okay, don't forget the, um,

23:11.041 --> 23:12.869
massaging the scar,

23:12.913 --> 23:15.219
the hand tapping exercise.
Oh, and, uh,

23:15.263 --> 23:16.438
-you got to do the second...
-STELLA: Yeah,

23:16.482 --> 23:18.092
with and without the liner.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.963
Yes. Do you not trust me
to take care of my own husband?

23:20.007 --> 23:22.226
CLAY: Didn't she prove herself
the week that you went back

23:22.270 --> 23:23.619
to Texas to see Leanne?

23:23.663 --> 23:25.316
Listen, y'all lost
a lot of points with me

23:25.360 --> 23:28.668
when you put a Baby Shark toy
in Brian's nursery.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.191
-[Brian crying over monitor]
-You hear that?

23:30.234 --> 23:32.411
He's terrified.
He's gonna be scarred for life.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.542
Just come back

23:33.586 --> 23:34.543
-in one piece, okay?
-Okay.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.153
SONNY:
All right.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.634
I'm just trying to wrap my brain
around my first op

23:38.678 --> 23:40.419
-without my battle boo.
-CLAY: Yeah, well,

23:40.462 --> 23:42.899
first of many, all right?
So dial it in.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.206
Hey.

23:45.249 --> 23:46.729
Jason's gonna need more
than a knuckle dragger

23:46.773 --> 23:48.688
-watching his six.
-I get it. You need me

23:48.731 --> 23:51.255
to step up and fill your shoe.

23:51.299 --> 23:54.389
Look, man, I'm gonna follow
your playbook and

23:54.433 --> 23:56.347
hit life's curveballs

23:56.391 --> 23:58.437
instead of letting them hit me.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.569
All right. Hey,

24:00.613 --> 24:02.092
kick a couple doors
for me, huh?

24:02.136 --> 24:03.224
I will.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.052
[door opens]

24:05.095 --> 24:06.314
[door closes]

24:06.357 --> 24:07.750
It's weird not knowing
where you're going.

24:07.794 --> 24:10.274
Yeah. Too bad you're
no longer cleared for TS.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.625
Sorry our night got canked.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.278
It's okay. I should probably

24:14.322 --> 24:16.455
start packing, too,
head back to McLean.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.326
You're not gonna stay?

24:18.369 --> 24:21.111
What, now that he likes me,
you want me to

24:21.155 --> 24:23.940
-take care of Cerberus?
-Oh, you know, it's...

24:23.984 --> 24:25.812
Kind of like the idea of, uh,

24:25.855 --> 24:27.944
knowing I'm gonna see you
when I get back home.

24:27.988 --> 24:31.252
Well, when you
put it like that...

24:31.295 --> 24:32.732
Yeah.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.129
Off you go to save the world.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.915
Listen, I know this is
my first spin-up since the...

24:41.958 --> 24:43.482
[whistles, imitates explosion]

24:43.525 --> 24:45.179
...but let me tell you,
I'm good,

24:45.222 --> 24:47.529
treatments are working and the
boys are gonna backstopping me.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.662
All right? And thanks to you,

24:49.705 --> 24:51.446
I was able to talk to Clay,

24:51.490 --> 24:54.231
keep my mind from spinning
out of control, all right?

24:54.275 --> 24:56.582
I'm good.

25:01.195 --> 25:02.979
[sighs]

25:03.023 --> 25:04.285
Good?

25:04.328 --> 25:05.547
-Yeah.
-All right.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.027
First op back
has got to be brutal.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.159
Uh, technically, it's
everyone's first op back.

25:09.203 --> 25:11.727
I just had more down time
than the rest of you.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.337
Turns out, uh,

25:13.381 --> 25:16.427
I handle life without Bravo
about as well as you do.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.517
Look, there's, uh, something
I got to fill you in on.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.953
Hey, look, uh,

25:19.996 --> 25:21.737
Ray and Sonny have read me in on

25:21.781 --> 25:23.347
what you're dealing with,
and, uh,

25:23.391 --> 25:24.479
how the rest of us are helping.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.394
Boss, you've always had my six,

25:26.437 --> 25:28.527
you better believe
I got yours right back.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.832
-Appreciate it.
-Absolutely.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.660
One hour till we reach
jump coordinates.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.141
All right, listen up,
Dixie cups.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.185
Yours truly

25:35.229 --> 25:36.622
has been elected to be

25:36.665 --> 25:39.059
your dive master
on this fine evening,

25:39.102 --> 25:42.018
-so let's prep it up.
-We all know the drill.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.237
Done dives like this
before, Sonny.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.717
Oh, really?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.022
You've done an exhaustion dive
in the Black Sea?

25:46.066 --> 25:48.416
Also known as
the Inhospitable Sea.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.896
JASON:
[laughs] Okay.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.289
Didn't we tell him
to stay off Wikipedia?

25:52.333 --> 25:53.856
SONNY:
Yeah. Look,

25:53.900 --> 25:55.945
y'all need to be on high alert
on this mission,

25:55.989 --> 25:58.905
okay? There is danger
at every corner.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.602
From, uh, boat collisions to

26:00.646 --> 26:03.387
other ships' magnetic signature
fucking with our compasses.

26:03.431 --> 26:04.867
I'm guessing there's no sharks

26:04.911 --> 26:06.565
because, if there was,
you would've led with that.

26:06.608 --> 26:07.827
Five species, to be exact.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.742
Okay, I would like first to go

26:09.785 --> 26:11.482
over the, uh, sea mine report.

26:11.526 --> 26:14.355
Great, those should take care
of the shark situation.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.705
SONNY: Look, we're down
one swim buddy on this,

26:16.749 --> 26:18.315
so I suggest that everyone

26:18.359 --> 26:19.969
take this seriously.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.626
All right, look,
I know we have lots of questions

26:24.670 --> 26:25.888
after losing Clay,

26:25.932 --> 26:27.194
but it's how we deal
with our shit

26:27.237 --> 26:28.717
after we're knocked down
that makes us Bravo.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.719
No better example of that
right now than Clay.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.547
All right? So, let's go.
We got this.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.983
-Yeah, roger that.
-Come on.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.290
JASON:
Hey.

26:38.118 --> 26:41.687
Your head okay? You don't seem,
uh, like you're into this.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.907
What's up?

26:44.951 --> 26:47.127
Well, I wasn't gonna
say anything

26:47.170 --> 26:49.651
with us spinning up,
but since you asked...

26:50.783 --> 26:52.959

43:53.195 --> 43:54.588
that would have
blown me up in the past.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.285
[sighs, groans]

43:56.329 --> 43:59.680
-How was this op?
-How was this op?

43:59.724 --> 44:01.551
The guys backstopped you?

44:01.595 --> 44:03.249
-Was your head okay?
-Yeah.

44:03.292 --> 44:05.643
-It's good.
-Just like you promised.

44:05.686 --> 44:07.166
Yeah.

44:07.209 --> 44:10.125
See?
You're gonna be fine without me.

44:10.169 --> 44:11.997
You've got the team
supporting you.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.303
Till Command splits us up.

44:14.347 --> 44:16.958
-What?
-There's a rumor going around

44:17.002 --> 44:19.004
that Command's
gonna break us up.

44:20.266 --> 44:21.528
It's...

44:21.571 --> 44:22.964
-[sighs]
-You know what?

44:23.008 --> 44:24.705
Uh, six weeks ago,

44:24.749 --> 44:25.924
I told them I couldn't get away.
I'll just say

44:25.967 --> 44:27.577
I need a little more time.

44:27.621 --> 44:29.492
[sighs] No. That's good.

44:29.536 --> 44:32.191
It's all right, you go.
People are in danger.

44:32.234 --> 44:33.627
You go.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.977
That's what you do.
That's what we do, so, hey.

44:36.021 --> 44:38.153
It's, uh, you don't
have to worry about me.

44:38.197 --> 44:39.502
I'm not worried about you,

44:39.546 --> 44:42.680
-but if-if you are...
-No, not at all.

44:42.723 --> 44:44.943
I'll be fine. Trust me.
I'll be good. Got this.

44:44.986 --> 44:47.380
All right, Cerby, that's good.
[whistles]

44:47.423 --> 44:48.686
-Speak.
-[barks]

44:58.043 --> 44:59.348
How long have you been...

44:59.392 --> 45:01.481
A minute, 57.

45:01.524 --> 45:03.701
58... 59...

45:03.744 --> 45:06.399
[chuckling] My God, two minutes.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.404
Day and a half, twice my goal.

45:21.370 --> 45:23.938
[sighs]

45:38.736 --> 45:40.346
[Cerberus whines]

45:53.489 --> 45:55.753
DAVIS: Well, I'm still
processing intel from Georgia.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.102
What's your excuse?

45:57.145 --> 45:58.799
You have anything
actionable yet?

45:58.843 --> 46:00.409
No, it's a lot to sort through.

46:00.453 --> 46:01.802
Well, forget actionable.

46:01.846 --> 46:04.239
I mean, uh,
do you have any leads?

46:04.283 --> 46:06.067
Maybe one.

46:06.111 --> 46:07.590
But it's isolated,

46:07.634 --> 46:09.070
and it's not enough
to build a package around.

46:09.114 --> 46:10.768
The IP address
linked to the payment

46:10.811 --> 46:12.770
for the rockets is anonymous,

46:12.813 --> 46:14.597
but we traced it
to northern Syria.

46:14.641 --> 46:16.121
Northern Syria, who's there?

46:16.164 --> 46:19.733
Who isn't? It's the Wild West
of extremist groups.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.866
It's a fucking hornets' nest
to send a team into,

46:21.909 --> 46:23.606
especially with no support
in the region.

46:23.650 --> 46:26.827
So, I'm hoping that the rest
of this intel points elsewhere.

46:26.871 --> 46:30.309
I'm just hoping that, uh,
Bravo Team is still around...

46:31.266 --> 46:34.879
...you know, to be that spear,
wherever you point it.

46:36.489 --> 46:38.447
You hear anything?

46:38.491 --> 46:40.710
Yeah, I mean,
I did some poking around.

46:40.754 --> 46:44.627
Yeah, this decommissioning
is more than a rumor.

46:44.671 --> 46:45.846
Anything on Bravo?

46:45.890 --> 46:48.153
They're part
of the conversation.

46:50.198 --> 46:51.852
Right.

46:51.896 --> 46:53.506
I got to get back to it.

46:55.508 --> 46:57.379
[keypad beeps]

46:57.423 --> 46:59.468
-[door opens]
-I'll see you around.

47:02.167 --> 47:06.167
-[door closes]
-Hopefully.
