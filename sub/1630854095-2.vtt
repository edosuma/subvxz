WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:05.048
Previously onSEAL Team...

00:05.092 --> 00:06.310
CLAY:
This is my last run with Bravo.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.008
I need to be there
for my family.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.922
Tell you what, drafting you was
the best decision that...

00:09.966 --> 00:12.012
Ray ever made.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.189
Down! Down!

00:15.232 --> 00:17.104
Where's his med kit?!
Where's his med kit?!

00:17.147 --> 00:19.323
Serious heavies down here.
Bravo 6 is down hard.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.759
Copy. One man down.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.022
Also has internal bleeding.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.327
Sounds like it's touch and go.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.807
-Oh, my gosh, baby.
-Don't worry, all right?

00:24.850 --> 00:26.591
I'll be with you and Brian
in no time.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.028
DAVIS:
Somebody messed up,

00:28.071 --> 00:29.333
and they need to be held
accountable.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.552
JASON:
If I stood down when I learned

00:30.595 --> 00:32.119
about my TBI,

00:32.162 --> 00:34.077
Clay would've been on his
family leave like he planned.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.297
SONNY:
Clay? Clay.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.038
His blood pressure was crashing.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.735
It's... sepsis.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.824
-What is it?
-JASON: Well, the infection

00:41.867 --> 00:43.565
was spreading,
so the doctors did

00:43.608 --> 00:46.133
what was necessary
in order to save his life.

00:48.918 --> 00:51.051
[high-pitched ringing]

00:52.095 --> 00:54.358
[muffled P.A. announcement]

00:54.402 --> 00:56.360
DOCTOR: To prevent the sepsis
from spreading,

00:56.404 --> 00:59.363
we had to perform an emergency
transtibial amputation

00:59.407 --> 01:01.278
on your right side.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.327
Petty Officer Spenser,

01:06.370 --> 01:09.243
we removed your right leg
below the knee.

01:09.286 --> 01:11.941
[chuckling softly]

01:11.984 --> 01:13.595
You...

01:13.638 --> 01:17.207
you guys got to come up with
a better prank than that, man.

01:17.251 --> 01:18.861
I can feel my leg just fine.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.776
It hurts like a bitch.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.303
â™ª

01:51.285 --> 01:53.287
GREGORY: Done for the day?

01:53.330 --> 01:55.027
Not even close.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.333
Well, maybe you should be.

01:56.377 --> 01:57.552
Don't want to overdo it.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.988
CLAY:
I will smack the shit out of you

01:59.031 --> 02:00.685
with those kid gloves
if you use 'em again.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.427
SONNY: [laughs]
Roger that, Stumpty Dumpty.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.994
Oh.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.865
Ooh, ooh. Shots fired. Too soon?

02:06.909 --> 02:08.302
[scoffs]

02:09.172 --> 02:10.695
[grunts]

02:23.708 --> 02:25.232
Nice.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.799
You sure it's less than
three months since your injury?

02:27.843 --> 02:29.453
You hear that, buddy?
Sounds like I'm getting

02:29.497 --> 02:31.194
some more DEVGRU records
to my collection.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.892
[groans] Greg, you are supposed
to be working on his balance,

02:33.936 --> 02:35.981
-not his ego.
-Hey, at the rate you're going,

02:36.025 --> 02:38.288
with some hard work, you should
be able to stand on your own

02:38.332 --> 02:39.898
for up to five minutes
next week.

02:39.942 --> 02:40.986
Ooh-wee.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.250
A whole week for five minutes?

02:43.293 --> 02:45.687
That should keep your ego
in check there, bud.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.123
I can do one minute right now.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.169
-Oh, really? Okay.
-[beeping]

02:49.212 --> 02:50.692
What you got there, tough guy?

02:50.735 --> 02:52.868
-Clock is starting.
-[beep]

02:55.479 --> 02:57.612
There you go.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.358
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, okay.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.750
-All right.
-Fuck.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.448
Happens all the time.
You're all right.

03:08.536 --> 03:09.798
Look, why don't you read me in
on some of the exercises

03:09.841 --> 03:11.321
that'll speed things along,
huh?

03:11.365 --> 03:13.236
Crawl, walk, run.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.933
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.635
[phone keys clacking]

03:22.289 --> 03:23.899
[phone chimes]

03:30.949 --> 03:31.994
[phone chimes]

03:36.346 --> 03:37.913
How'd that drip treat you,
Mr. Jeffrey?

03:37.956 --> 03:40.350
Tell you what, I feel younger
every time I leave here, Debbie.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.744
That's what we like to hear.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.355
I see we don't have
your insurance on file.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.227
Yeah, you know,
I like to avoid the red tape.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.272
-Right? So, $2,000, right?
-Yeah.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.840
I will see you in three weeks.

03:52.797 --> 03:55.235
-Have a good day, Debbie.
-You, too.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.325
[clock ticking]

03:58.368 --> 03:59.935
[birds chirping]

03:59.978 --> 04:02.503
[footsteps approaching]

04:02.546 --> 04:03.895
NAIMA:
Ooh. Sorry.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.680
I didn't mean to interrupt
your therapy.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.944
No. [grunts]
I was just finishing up.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.511
You know what?

04:10.554 --> 04:11.990
I was thinking
I would make you some waffles

04:12.034 --> 04:13.427
for your last day of work.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.559
[chuckles] My last day of work
at the hospital.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.169
Getting our vet center
up and running

04:17.213 --> 04:18.736
is gonna be a full-time job,

04:18.780 --> 04:20.172
only with...

04:20.216 --> 04:22.087
much worse pay.

04:22.131 --> 04:24.046
Did I mention there'd be, uh,
whipped cream on those waffles?

04:24.089 --> 04:25.395
Wow. [chuckles]

04:25.439 --> 04:27.571
-Hmm?
-Let's save

04:27.615 --> 04:30.008
the sugar and carbs
for tomorrow.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.271
We're gonna need the energy

04:31.314 --> 04:32.272
while we're looking at
facilities

04:32.315 --> 04:33.664
the realtor has lined up for us.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.318
Yeah?

04:35.362 --> 04:36.450
This means a lot,

04:36.493 --> 04:37.712
you giving up your career

04:37.755 --> 04:39.279
so we can do this together.

04:40.105 --> 04:42.325
I'm getting a lot more
than I'm giving up.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.850
It's the right move
for the people who need us.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.939
This war's making
a lot more of 'em every day.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.114
Yeah.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.899
SONNY:
Tight corner.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.683
You'll give Austin Dillon
a little run

04:52.727 --> 04:54.468
-for his money now, buddy.
-[laughs]

04:54.511 --> 04:56.339
Hi, Daddy.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.036
Hi.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.255
-Say hi.
-Hey.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.996
Um, so Brian did something awful

05:01.039 --> 05:03.868
-in his diaper. I'm sorry.
-Well, anything is better

05:03.912 --> 05:05.130
than Clay's

05:05.174 --> 05:06.958
stinky sock when that leg
comes off, isn't it?

05:07.002 --> 05:08.482
-Sonny, please.
-SONNY: Your daddy's got

05:08.525 --> 05:10.135
a stinky leg, doesn't he?

05:10.179 --> 05:12.703
-He got a stinky leg. [babbles]
-[sighs] Here, let me...

05:12.747 --> 05:14.139
Yeah, you got to let me do this.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.837
-Okay.
-[Brian crying]

05:22.409 --> 05:23.671
Okay.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.809
-[clears throat]
-[grunts]

05:36.684 --> 05:38.686
-Ooh... Oh, okay, okay, okay.
-You see?

05:38.729 --> 05:39.991
-Yeah.
-He's right.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.471
Might need to burn it.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.473
Thank you. Throw it over there.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.909
[clears throat]

05:44.953 --> 05:47.521
Sonny did send me
a video from PT.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.479
Looked like you were, uh,

05:49.523 --> 05:51.220
you were pushing kind of hard.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.657
Sweating can cause friction

05:53.701 --> 05:56.312
and put you at risk
for infection.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.358
Do you see any rash or bruising?

05:59.402 --> 06:00.490
No, I don't.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.926
I'm all good.

06:01.970 --> 06:04.581
SONNY: All right, I changed that
Chernobyl of a diaper

06:04.625 --> 06:06.931
and I got Brian down for a nap.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.846
Oh, thank you.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.674
[sighs] Sonny, will you tell
my wife how I feel

06:10.718 --> 06:12.415
-about being babied.
-Well, from her,

06:12.459 --> 06:13.851
I-I don't see how
that's a bad thing,

06:13.895 --> 06:16.506
considering the potential
of a sponge bath,

06:16.550 --> 06:18.160
-Professor Clay-vier.
-[laughs]

06:18.203 --> 06:19.988
-Thank you.
-[Sonny laughing]

06:22.556 --> 06:24.166
SONNY:
Hey, you got to be kidding me.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.733
20 years of fighting this war,

06:25.776 --> 06:27.430
and it's still
open season on us.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.389
CLAY: Maybe someone should
remind the world what happens

06:29.432 --> 06:30.651
when they poke the bear.

06:30.694 --> 06:33.697
You know what?
In happier news,

06:33.741 --> 06:36.047
you guys should both see
what Brian did this morning

06:36.091 --> 06:37.527
during tummy time.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.137
Why does this kid
always hit targets

06:39.181 --> 06:40.661
in the few hours a week
that I'm gone?

06:40.704 --> 06:42.184
SONNY:
I would love to stay and watch,

06:42.227 --> 06:44.099
but DEVGRU is calling, so...

06:44.142 --> 06:46.710
if you, uh, y'all need
a little chauffeur later

06:46.754 --> 06:49.278
to transport this chair around,

06:49.321 --> 06:51.454
-just holler at your boy.
-Okay.

06:51.498 --> 06:54.065
And I bet you, right now,
you're really wishing

06:54.109 --> 06:55.284
you'd taken that minivan.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.242
Absolutely the fuck not.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.549
Thank you, Sonny. [laughs]

06:59.593 --> 07:01.029
-Love you, buddy.
-SONNY: Yeah.

07:01.072 --> 07:04.424
-[door shuts]
-[Brian cooing over video]

07:06.077 --> 07:08.340
Oh, this is a surprise.
[chuckles]

07:08.384 --> 07:09.994
-[door closes]
-Did you forget I was coming?

07:10.038 --> 07:11.518
We sure this stem cell stuff
is working?

07:11.561 --> 07:13.041
No, I meant,

07:13.084 --> 07:14.999
you know, the hair missile
using you as a pillow.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.348
-[chuckles]
-It is working.

07:16.392 --> 07:18.742
Mmm.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.918
I tell you what,
that treatment that I'm

07:20.962 --> 07:23.834
using right now--
it is worth every dime

07:23.878 --> 07:26.315
I'm spending to keep it
off Command's radar.

07:26.358 --> 07:27.882
[phone vibrates]

07:29.274 --> 07:31.451
Is there a treatment
for your new addiction

07:31.494 --> 07:32.756
-to brain-training apps?
-It's Sonny.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.759
He always updates me
after Clay's PT session.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.544
I'm sure he'd appreciate it

07:37.587 --> 07:39.328
if you stopped by his next one.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.722
Yeah, you know, I'm just trying
to give him his space right now.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.941
I don't want to be a reminder

07:43.985 --> 07:46.248
-of everything that he's lost.
-Reminder

07:46.291 --> 07:47.684
because you're his team leader

07:47.728 --> 07:48.859
or because
you think you're the one

07:48.903 --> 07:50.470
who put him in the line of fire?

07:54.691 --> 07:56.040
Well, I just hope

07:56.084 --> 07:58.782
you're not ignoring
and overriding

07:58.826 --> 08:01.176
whatever it is you're
carrying around about Clay.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.833
I tell you what. What do you say
we, uh, go to the beach?

08:05.876 --> 08:08.575
Better yet, go on a hike
with Cerby? Come on.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.751
Let's go for a hike.
Good boy.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.883
Have a little extra energy
from mainlining

08:12.927 --> 08:14.232
the fountain of youth, do you?

08:14.276 --> 08:15.277
Just because I'm getting

08:15.320 --> 08:16.321
all these brain treatments

08:16.365 --> 08:17.758
doesn't mean I have to ignore

08:17.801 --> 08:19.499
the bonus side effects.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.066
I think I have, uh, a better use

08:22.110 --> 08:23.764
-for the side effects.
-Really?

08:23.807 --> 08:26.810
-What's that? Mmm.
-Mm-hmm.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.205
[door opens]

08:34.601 --> 08:36.428
Always so well prepared.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.431
Yet you rarely speak up.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.085
Prefer to listen and learn.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.827
I would rather answer best
than first.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.917
Rough day for the Navy. Any word
on who hit the Crampton?

08:46.961 --> 08:48.919
-It's a rough day for all of us.
-[door opens]

08:48.963 --> 08:51.008
And no one has taken credit
for the attack.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.445
I see this group
is as eager to discuss

08:53.489 --> 08:55.012
the attack on the USS Crampton

08:55.056 --> 08:57.058
as the Joint Chiefs'
morning session was.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.930
It is indeed a reminder why
we're establishing a beachhead

08:59.974 --> 09:02.803
for much-needed change
in the ways we wage war.

09:02.846 --> 09:06.023
You were driving to a point,
Major Gerretsen?

09:06.067 --> 09:07.677
GERRETSEN: Good morning,
Admiral Stevens. Yes, ma'am.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.680
Our strategy of pouring money
into spec ops

09:10.724 --> 09:12.247
to chase extremists
seems to have failed

09:12.290 --> 09:14.771
twice here. First,
because our special forces

09:14.815 --> 09:16.294
clearly didn't
prevent the attack

09:16.338 --> 09:18.209
and again, because it left
the ship with outdated

09:18.253 --> 09:21.212
CIWS technology that failed to
take out all incoming rockets.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.649
STEVENS:
Interesting analysis.

09:22.692 --> 09:25.826
The question
we in this room face:

09:25.869 --> 09:27.871
how does this insight
factor into the strategies

09:27.915 --> 09:29.743
that we're considering
for SecDef

09:29.786 --> 09:32.397
as we prepare to effect
structural changes

09:32.441 --> 09:35.618
in our pivot away
from the global war on terror

09:35.662 --> 09:38.012
and toward great power
competition?

09:38.055 --> 09:39.709
It argues against going all in

09:39.753 --> 09:41.885
on cyber and
disinformation tactics

09:41.929 --> 09:44.018
at the expense
of conventional forces,

09:44.061 --> 09:45.802
who have already
been left ill-equipped

09:45.846 --> 09:47.935
after two decades
of narrow-minded focus

09:47.978 --> 09:50.067
on spec ops and expensive tech.

09:50.111 --> 09:53.462
The advantage to cyber
and disinformation tactics

09:53.505 --> 09:56.813
is the reduced risk
to our troops on the ground,

09:56.857 --> 09:59.424
both spec ops and conventional.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.643
But war remains kinetic.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.949
With Russia's invasion
of Ukraine

10:01.992 --> 10:04.081
and China poised to move
on Taiwan any minute,

10:04.125 --> 10:06.823
we need to ask ourselves
if the U.S. were attacked,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.651
would we really continue to rely

10:08.695 --> 10:10.871
on a select few
special operators

10:10.914 --> 10:13.134
to defend our whole nation?

10:24.754 --> 10:26.234
[exhales]

10:26.277 --> 10:28.628
Little shit doesn't even
have teeth yet,

10:28.671 --> 10:30.978
and he still just bit my nipple.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.849
You want me to kiss it
and make it better?

10:34.503 --> 10:36.766
How's the phantom limb pain?

10:36.810 --> 10:38.463
CLAY:
It's still a trip, but

10:38.507 --> 10:41.466
it's a little less freaky
thanks to this mirror therapy.

10:41.510 --> 10:42.772
-Good.
-[phone chimes]

10:42.816 --> 10:45.383
-It's Jason.
-What's he saying?

10:48.648 --> 10:49.910
[sighs]

10:49.953 --> 10:51.215
He's asking if I want
to see the team.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.087
They've come by
since you got back.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.436
I think that he means
all of them

10:54.479 --> 10:55.872
at the same out in the world.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.787
You sure you're ready
for full Bravo reunion?

10:57.831 --> 10:59.397
I mean, it's not like
I've been avoiding them.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.313
But I have been at DEVGRU,
like, three times a week,

11:02.357 --> 11:04.228
and I haven't wandered over
to the cages or the team room.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.317
Maybe you're just waiting
till you can walk in

11:06.361 --> 11:07.405
on your own two feet.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.322
All I've been doing these
past couple months is wait.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.020
You know, to come home
from the hospital,

11:13.063 --> 11:15.762
for the incision to heal, to get
fitted for the prosthetic.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.374
I'm done waiting.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.376
Brock, you suck at this, man.
Clay would literally have

11:21.419 --> 11:23.073
twice as much done
in half the time.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.248
How long they been
at each other?

11:24.292 --> 11:25.728
Yeah, long enough.
All right,

11:25.772 --> 11:27.338
hey, listen up,
Clay's definitely in

11:27.382 --> 11:30.385
for a hang tonight, all right?
We're all going. Got it?

11:31.734 --> 11:32.996
Be good to see him.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.129
-Yeah.
-Well, uh, first round's on me.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.392
-Oh, look who it is.
-BROCK: Oh, Trent.

11:37.435 --> 11:38.610
Hey.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.351
-What's up, man?
-[grunts]

11:40.395 --> 11:42.310
-This mean you're back, brother?
-And cleared hot.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.138
SONNY:
Oh, that's fan-fucking-tastic.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.706
Fewer chances for Brock
to open his trap.

11:46.749 --> 11:47.707
[laughter]

11:47.750 --> 11:50.013
Hey... I'm just, uh,

11:50.057 --> 11:52.712
I'm sorry I wasn't, uh, with you
guys when you got hit in Mali.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.191
JASON: Yeah, well, you know
what, you definitely took

11:54.235 --> 11:56.019
your own beating,
that's for sure.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.020
Good to see you, man.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.500
Sure you're good to go?

11:58.543 --> 12:01.068
Docs fixed my back,
my hip, my shoulder.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.373
I mean, hell, at this point,
I feel like

12:02.417 --> 12:04.506
I got it easy compared
to the rest of you guys.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.116
-Good.
-[laughter]

12:06.160 --> 12:08.118
Well, the rest of us
got off easy, too.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.512
I mean, waiting ten weeks
to get cleared to operate

12:10.555 --> 12:11.774
is nothing compared to Clay.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.080
JASON:
Well, life after Bravo 6

12:13.123 --> 12:14.385
is definitely
gonna be an adjustment.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.909
SONNY:
Nothing to adjust to.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.868
Without Clay,
Bravo isn't Bravo anymore.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.917
â™ª

12:35.189 --> 12:36.494
Now, him coming out--
that's a good sign, right?

12:36.538 --> 12:38.061
Yeah, it's a good sign,
but, you know,

12:38.105 --> 12:39.062
I don't know if this
is the right place.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.238
Well, Bulkhead was his idea.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.892
There's nowhere to look
without seeing SEAL stuff.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.285
It's definitely gonna
stir things up.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.026
Well, maybe confronting
those emotions

12:46.069 --> 12:47.505
head-on will help him.

12:47.549 --> 12:50.421
Haven't, uh, seen him since
before the injury.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.206
How rough's it been?

12:52.249 --> 12:54.034
Well, he was pretty down
in Germany,

12:54.077 --> 12:55.426
had some rough days
at Walter Reed,

12:55.470 --> 12:57.428
but him getting home
to his wife and son--

12:57.472 --> 12:59.909
-I think it was good for him.
-[door opens]

13:02.520 --> 13:03.739
There he is.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.306
-You good?
-Yeah.

13:05.349 --> 13:08.918
â™ª And the whole damn world
went wrong...â™ª

13:13.140 --> 13:14.794
-Hi.
-What's going on?

13:14.837 --> 13:16.621
â™ª Then I woke up...â™ª

13:16.665 --> 13:18.406
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.452
Well, all these years,
I never knew that

13:21.496 --> 13:23.498
Clay was the life
of Bravo's party.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.241
Well, they've just never seen
a one-legged frog before.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.460
-[laughter]
-There he is.

13:29.504 --> 13:32.115
-Good to see you, boss.
-Man of the hour.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.639
-You look good.
-Yo, yo.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.816
Well...

13:36.859 --> 13:38.078
you haven't seen all of me.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.383
-Hey, now.
-Oh.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.604
â™ª Those fanatics...â™ª

13:42.647 --> 13:45.215
CLAY: Thing's got
state of the art hydraulics.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.521
Still shiny two weeks in.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.044
SONNY:
It's made in China, so, uh,

13:48.088 --> 13:50.655
-careful what you say.
-[soft laughter]

13:51.439 --> 13:53.136
Hey, I'm gonna get a drink.
You want something?

13:53.180 --> 13:54.224
Uh, can we just get a round

13:54.268 --> 13:55.486
-for the table?
-Yup.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.314
I'll help you.

13:58.533 --> 14:02.189
â™ª And so many
can't be found...â™ª

14:05.409 --> 14:08.282
This, uh, was, uh, your
fifth rehab session today?

14:08.325 --> 14:10.110
Yeah, you know, got to push hard

14:10.153 --> 14:11.894
if I'm gonna instruct
at Green Team.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.250
Well, Green Team
sounds like a great way

14:20.294 --> 14:22.122
of adapting and overcoming.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.167
It's smart to find
another way to serve.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.777
Transitioning
out of the field is

14:25.821 --> 14:28.824
a tough enough adjustment
even when it's your choice.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.565
Technically, this was my choice.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.742
I made the plan before Mali
so I could spend more time

14:33.785 --> 14:35.004
with Brian and Stella.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.223
Injury only changed
the timetable.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.052
SONNY: Well, Green Team is lucky

14:39.095 --> 14:41.619
to have you show the ropes
there, Hot Wheels.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.230
[laughs]

14:43.273 --> 14:45.145
You do remember what Clay
was like on Green Team, right?

14:45.188 --> 14:47.190
-[Ray laughs]
-Oh, yeah.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.671
I mean, I-I once saw the man

14:49.714 --> 14:50.933
mouth off to his instructor

14:50.977 --> 14:52.326
and slip his number to a girl

14:52.369 --> 14:54.894
who had a gun at his head
all in the same breath.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.025
-[laughter]
-RAY: True story.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.375
Hey. Hey.
No, no, no, no. Hey, now.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.029
Look, I'm a quiet
professional, okay?

15:00.073 --> 15:01.726
She gave me her number.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.467
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.385
It took a lot of lobbying
to get you on Bravo.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.735
Best decision Ray ever made.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.346
[Ray chuckles]

15:17.351 --> 15:19.831
I'm surprised you took
your eye off Clay.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.399
Got a career in the
Secret Service after operating.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.227
Don't let him hear you
talk like that.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.925
He'd rather be picked on
than pitied.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.928
I'm actually very proud of
the way you stepped up for him.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.886
I mean, you already
had a full plate

15:30.930 --> 15:32.540
with Bravo and Leanne.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.585
He's my brother.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.326
Got no other choice.

15:37.632 --> 15:41.070
Thing I am struggling with,
though, is, uh,

15:41.114 --> 15:42.767
you know...

15:42.811 --> 15:45.770
we'll never get to play Johnny
Bravo outside the wire again.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.076
I'm sorry.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.383
-This is not easy.
-Hardest part is...

15:49.426 --> 15:51.733
is keeping a stiff upper lip
around him.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.213
I don't know
if you know this about me,

15:53.256 --> 15:54.736
I just tend to, uh,

15:54.779 --> 15:57.043
wear my emotions on my sleeve.

15:57.086 --> 15:58.435
Think I've seen that
once or twice.

15:58.479 --> 15:59.915
-Oh, really? Yeah?
-Yeah.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.786
-Wow.
-If it makes you feel any

16:01.830 --> 16:03.049
better, I've been struggling

16:03.092 --> 16:04.398
-to hide my emotions, too.
-Oh, yeah?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.140
-Yes. Over at the Pentagon.
-Oh, yeah?

16:07.183 --> 16:08.793
-Mm-hmm.
-What, you're already

16:08.837 --> 16:10.708
butting heads at, uh,

16:10.752 --> 16:12.406
cake-eater fantasy camp, hm?

16:12.449 --> 16:15.017
Okay, we're setting policy,
we're not just blowing hot air,

16:15.061 --> 16:16.453
-all right?
-Oh, really?

16:16.497 --> 16:18.064
And I'm walking a tightrope
trying to argue

16:18.107 --> 16:20.066
for stricter scrutiny
before approving ops

16:20.109 --> 16:21.981
that are high-risk
and low-reward.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.287
Just trying to...

16:24.331 --> 16:26.594
-prevent another Clay.
-Well, in the meantime,

16:26.637 --> 16:29.205
I'm really hoping that the Navy
is using their resources

16:29.249 --> 16:31.294
to wipe out the dirtbags
that did this to him.

16:31.338 --> 16:34.297
Well, the official AAR
on the Mali op came down,

16:34.341 --> 16:37.170
blames the ambush
on the CIA's SGS informant.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.215
Seems he was playing both sides.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.825
The Agency screwed up?

16:40.869 --> 16:42.958
-Yeah.
-Color me shocked.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.179
Oh, damn, Davis, I thought
you were gonna come over here

16:46.222 --> 16:47.745
and cheer me up.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.313
Okay, then
here's some good news.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.662
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.229
I am moving

16:53.273 --> 16:55.449
to a new posting
in Command next week.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.018
Overseeing intel
for all the teams.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.325
Wow. That...

17:02.369 --> 17:05.285
That's great. I'm... I'm...

17:05.328 --> 17:07.374
-really happy for you.
-Wow. Okay.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.854
-Does your face know it?
-I mean, come on.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.379
You're leaving Bravo,
like we always talked about.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.076
-Yeah.
-But you're...

17:15.121 --> 17:16.426
...still at Command.

17:16.470 --> 17:19.342
So, that leaves us...

17:19.386 --> 17:23.520
In our same, normal,
dysfunctional place.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.566
Yeah.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.048
Gonna crush on the Green Team.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.746
There you go.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.229
Thanks, boss.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.710
So, how's, uh,

17:39.754 --> 17:41.060
how's everything going
with your noggin?

17:41.103 --> 17:42.235
Nope.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.411
My turn to get
an update on you.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.456
[chuckles]
Come on, Jace, I asked first.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.894
You find something to work?

17:49.938 --> 17:52.549
Yeah, I got some treatments
I've been looking into and, uh,

17:52.593 --> 17:56.292
seems like this new stem cell
infusion thing seems to be, uh,

17:56.336 --> 17:58.033
getting me the best results
so far. [chuckles]

17:58.077 --> 18:00.296
That's some new school thinking
for a crusty old bullfrog.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.907
-Yeah, yeah, it is.
-[laughs]

18:02.951 --> 18:04.518
Listen, I...
You know, I remember that time

18:04.561 --> 18:06.041
you got blown up in Manila

18:06.085 --> 18:07.564
and you went radio silent
for some time.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.131
You showing up here tonight

18:09.175 --> 18:11.133
speaks volumes.
Says a lot about you.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.222
I'm not the same person
I was then.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.138
In a lot of ways.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.793
But, you know, overcoming
my injuries back then

18:18.836 --> 18:20.447
helps remind me that
I can do it again.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.537
Right. This a little
different, though, huh?

18:23.580 --> 18:25.626
You know, it sucked at first.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.671
And I had
my pity parties, but...

18:28.716 --> 18:30.848
You know,
then I-I remembered the...

18:32.198 --> 18:33.416
You know, the path
getting me here

18:33.460 --> 18:35.157
might be different
than I expected,

18:35.201 --> 18:36.463
still moving towards
the same target.

18:36.506 --> 18:37.464
-Green Team.
-For now,

18:37.507 --> 18:38.769
then we'll see, you know?

18:38.813 --> 18:40.510
Wouldn't be the first guy
to operate again

18:40.554 --> 18:42.860
-after losing a limb.
-Just don't overdo it.

18:42.904 --> 18:46.429
All those surgeries.
Healing hurts, man.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.431
I'm not touching
the painkillers.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.390
You know, I saw with Swanny that

18:50.433 --> 18:52.000
the cure can be worse
than the problem.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.742
I got a good support system
between Stella and Bravo.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.659
That's good. How's she,
uh, handling all this?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.226
She's the strongest person
I know.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.662
Ah.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.320
Though I overheard her
on the phone with her mom

19:07.363 --> 19:09.148
saying that, you know,

19:09.191 --> 19:11.237
whenever she gets a little
overwhelmed by everything,

19:11.280 --> 19:12.629
she reminds herself
to be relieved that

19:12.673 --> 19:14.153
she doesn't
have to worry about me

19:14.196 --> 19:17.634
-being killed in battle anymore.
-[sighs]

19:17.678 --> 19:19.549
Look, uh...

19:21.116 --> 19:23.510
Everything you're going through

19:23.553 --> 19:25.903
is, uh...

19:25.947 --> 19:27.166
I'm sorry.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.517
You're saying that
like you blame yourself.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.519
Well, you know, you lost
your leg because of me.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.522
If I'd dealt with my head...

19:35.565 --> 19:38.177
when that building
came down in Mali,

19:38.220 --> 19:39.656
there's-there's no way

19:39.700 --> 19:41.658
you would have been with Bravo
on this ambush.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.879
You would've been back home like
you planned with your family.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.228
Like, you-you...

19:46.272 --> 19:47.969
you want to think
of yourself as the master

19:48.012 --> 19:49.492
of everyone's universe.

19:49.536 --> 19:52.060
Well, see it this way.
It helped me feel better, too.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.845
If not for you, my picture

19:54.889 --> 19:56.847
would be up there,
Stella would be a widow

19:56.891 --> 19:58.675
and Brian would
never know his father.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.721
You ended that fight and
you got me out of there alive.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.726
There's more to life
than operating.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.513
[bottles clink]

20:10.557 --> 20:12.341
Rooms for short-term housing,

20:12.385 --> 20:15.301
long-term housing,
a medical clinic.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.041
Kitchen, probably a chow hall.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.087
You really think there's a place
around here that has all this?

20:19.130 --> 20:20.480
If there isn't, we'll make one.

20:20.523 --> 20:21.698
We're not gonna be another group

20:21.742 --> 20:23.439
cutting corners
at vets' expense.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.006
Well, if the broker
tells us we have to settle,

20:25.049 --> 20:27.530
it's good to know you've
already got your speech prepped.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.010
-Yeah.
-Look at you.

20:29.053 --> 20:32.274
-Let me see. Look at you.
-[phone vibrates]

20:37.148 --> 20:39.412
[sighs] It's work.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.283
I didn't want
to miss this one, baby.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.633
I can handle a couple of
real estate showings on my own.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.331
Of course you can, I just...

20:46.593 --> 20:48.464
I wish I could
be there with you.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.597
This is our project.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.207
-Our dream.
-That's true, whether

20:52.251 --> 20:54.688
you're in Virginia Beach or some
highly-classified location.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.647
We're in this together. Bye.

21:01.869 --> 21:02.957
[door opens]

21:03.000 --> 21:04.263
DAVIS:
The Navy destroyer

21:04.306 --> 21:06.265
U.S.S. Crampton
was hit yesterday

21:06.308 --> 21:08.223
with three
Russian Kornet rockets

21:08.267 --> 21:10.747
while stationed off of the
Mediterranean coast of Turkey.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.836
20 American sailors
were killed in the attack.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.751
Biggest haymaker
thrown at us in years.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.449
-Who's taking credit?
-DAVIS: Nobody yet,

21:16.492 --> 21:18.581
but it has
all the hallmarks of ISIS.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.758
Well, reaching out and touching
some ISIS dirtbags

21:21.802 --> 21:23.412
may actually, uh, help Bravo

21:23.456 --> 21:24.761
get their groove back.

21:24.805 --> 21:25.980
SOTO: Alpha and Foxtrot
will be hitting

21:26.023 --> 21:27.068
targets in the region that

21:27.111 --> 21:27.982
may yield the trigger-pullers.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.984
So why are we here?

21:30.027 --> 21:31.768
Intel has determined that
the Kornets used in the attack

21:31.812 --> 21:33.466
were supplied by an arms dealer

21:33.509 --> 21:36.077
operating out of the port
of Sukhumi, Georgia,

21:36.120 --> 21:38.775
most likely skimmed from
Russia's campaign in Ukraine.

21:38.819 --> 21:41.517
Bravo will infiltrate
the arms depot,

21:41.561 --> 21:43.084
capture the traffickers,

21:43.127 --> 21:44.694
conduct an SSE for intel

21:44.738 --> 21:46.566
and disable the remaining
cache of weapons.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.002
Well, that's in Abkhazia.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.309
Russia-backed
separatist region of Georgia.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.398
Their dispute goes back
to the end of the Soviet Union.

21:52.441 --> 21:53.790
Don't they all?

21:53.834 --> 21:55.749
DAVIS: The Sukhumi Seaport
is roughly 45

21:55.792 --> 21:58.795
klicks south of the
7th Military Base in Gudauta,

21:58.839 --> 22:02.146
home to over 4,000
Russian and Abkhaz troops.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.713
So, goes without saying,

22:03.757 --> 22:05.324
if they even catch
a whiff of Bravo...

22:05.367 --> 22:07.151
JASON: American boots hitting
a Russian-occupied

22:07.195 --> 22:09.502
target on the Black Sea--

22:09.545 --> 22:11.895
mistakes, they just
lead to World War III.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.512
Cannot stay long
in the contested region.

22:19.555 --> 22:20.991
That's why we're diving.
In and out.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.516
C-17 can't get anywhere near
Russian airspace.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.952
We'll run a duck.

22:24.995 --> 22:27.128
Jump from Bulgarian airspace
with a Zodiac.

22:27.171 --> 22:30.174
Take it as far as we can
into international waters,

22:30.218 --> 22:31.480
swim the rest of the way in.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.569
That's four to six
hours underwater.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.005
Welcome back.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.181
RAY: We can have an agency team
standing by

22:37.225 --> 22:38.487
to collect the arms dealers

22:38.531 --> 22:39.662
before we swim back
to the Zodiac.

22:39.706 --> 22:40.924
That's optimistic, being that

22:40.968 --> 22:42.839
we're gonna be shark bait
for 12 hours,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.538
and considering
Bravo's hits lately,

22:45.581 --> 22:47.017
I'm not sure that
I want to tempt fate.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.671
How are we gonna
take out the rockets?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.631
Stack 'em and blow 'em.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.023
TRENT:
Sukhumi's heavily populated.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.808
We can't risk
civilian casualties.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.505
If we control the explosion,

22:56.549 --> 22:57.854
we can minimize
the blast radius.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.160
RAY:
Still, that boom is gonna

22:59.203 --> 23:00.379
draw a lot of eyes in an area

23:00.422 --> 23:01.684
with Russian troop presence.

23:01.728 --> 23:02.859
Which is why
we'll be in the water

23:02.903 --> 23:04.687
while those fuses are going off.

23:04.731 --> 23:07.473
They won't know what hit them.
Easy day, boys. Let's go.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.998
Okay, don't forget the, um,

23:11.041 --> 23:12.869
massaging the scar,

23:12.913 --> 23:15.219
the hand tapping exercise.
Oh, and, uh,

23:15.263 --> 23:16.438
-you got to do the second...
-STELLA: Yeah,

23:16.482 --> 23:18.092
with and without the liner.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.963
Yes. Do you not trust me
to take care of my own husband?

23:20.007 --> 23:22.226
CLAY: Didn't she prove herself
the week that you went back

23:22.270 --> 23:23.619
to Texas to see Leanne?

23:23.663 --> 23:25.316
Listen, y'all lost
a lot of points with me

23:25.360 --> 23:28.668
when you put a Baby Shark toy
in Brian's nursery.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.191
-[Brian crying over monitor]
-You hear that?

23:30.234 --> 23:32.411
He's terrified.
He's gonna be scarred for life.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.542
Just come back

23:33.586 --> 23:34.543
-in one piece, okay?
-Okay.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.153
SONNY:
All right.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.634
I'm just trying to wrap my brain
around my first op

23:38.678 --> 23:40.419
-without my battle boo.
-CLAY: Yeah, well,

23:40.462 --> 23:42.899
first of many, all right?
So dial it in.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.206
Hey.

23:45.249 --> 23:46.729
Jason's gonna need more
than a knuckle dragger

23:46.773 --> 23:48.688
-watching his six.
-I get it. You need me

23:48.731 --> 23:51.255
to step up and fill your shoe.

23:51.299 --> 23:54.389
Look, man, I'm gonna follow
your playbook and

23:54.433 --> 23:56.347
hit life's curveballs

23:56.391 --> 23:58.437
instead of letting them hit me.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.569
All right. Hey,

24:00.613 --> 24:02.092
kick a couple doors
for me, huh?

24:02.136 --> 24:03.224
I will.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.052
[door opens]

24:05.095 --> 24:06.314
[door closes]

24:06.357 --> 24:07.750
It's weird not knowing
where you're going.

24:07.794 --> 24:10.274
Yeah. Too bad you're
no longer cleared for TS.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.625
Sorry our night got canked.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.278
It's okay. I should probably

24:14.322 --> 24:16.455
start packing, too,
head back to McLean.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.326
You're not gonna stay?

24:18.369 --> 24:21.111
What, now that he likes me,
you want me to

24:21.155 --> 24:23.940
-take care of Cerberus?
-Oh, you know, it's...

24:23.984 --> 24:25.812
Kind of like the idea of, uh,

24:25.855 --> 24:27.944
knowing I'm gonna see you
when I get back home.

24:27.988 --> 24:31.252
Well, when you
put it like that...

24:31.295 --> 24:32.732
Yeah.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.129
Off you go to save the world.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.915
Listen, I know this is
my first spin-up since the...

24:41.958 --> 24:43.482
[whistles, imitates explosion]

24:43.525 --> 24:45.179
...but let me tell you,
I'm good,

24:45.222 --> 24:47.529
treatments are working and the
boys are gonna backstopping me.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.662
All right? And thanks to you,

24:49.705 --> 24:51.446
I was able to talk to Clay,

24:51.490 --> 24:54.231
keep my mind from spinning
out of control, all right?

24:54.275 --> 24:56.582
I'm good.

25:01.195 --> 25:02.979
[sighs]

25:03.023 --> 25:04.285
Good?

25:04.328 --> 25:05.547
-Yeah.
-All right.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.027
First op back
has got to be brutal.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.159
Uh, technically, it's
everyone's first op back.

25:09.203 --> 25:11.727
I just had more down time
than the rest of you.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.337
Turns out, uh,

25:13.381 --> 25:16.427
I handle life without Bravo
about as well as you do.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.517
Look, there's, uh, something
I got to fill you in on.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.953
Hey, look, uh,

25:19.996 --> 25:21.737
Ray and Sonny have read me in on

25:21.781 --> 25:23.347
what you're dealing with,
and, uh,

25:23.391 --> 25:24.479
how the rest of us are helping.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.394
Boss, you've always had my six,

25:26.437 --> 25:28.527
you better believe
I got yours right back.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.832
-Appreciate it.
-Absolutely.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.660
One hour till we reach
jump coordinates.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.141
All right, listen up,
Dixie cups.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.185
Yours truly

25:35.229 --> 25:36.622
has been elected to be

25:36.665 --> 25:39.059
your dive master
on this fine evening,

25:39.102 --> 25:42.018
-so let's prep it up.
-We all know the drill.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.237
Done dives like this
before, Sonny.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.717
Oh, really?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.022
You've done an exhaustion dive
in the Black Sea?

25:46.066 --> 25:48.416
Also known as
the Inhospitable Sea.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.896
JASON:
[laughs] Okay.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.289
Didn't we tell him
to stay off Wikipedia?

25:52.333 --> 25:53.856
SONNY:
Yeah. Look,

25:53.900 --> 25:55.945
y'all need to be on high alert
on this mission,

25:55.989 --> 25:58.905
okay? There is danger
at every corner.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.602
From, uh, boat collisions to

26:00.646 --> 26:03.387
other ships' magnetic signature
fucking with our compasses.

26:03.431 --> 26:04.867
I'm guessing there's no sharks

26:04.911 --> 26:06.565
because, if there was,
you would've led with that.

26:06.608 --> 26:07.827
Five species, to be exact.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.742
Okay, I would like first to go

26:09.785 --> 26:11.482
over the, uh, sea mine report.

26:11.526 --> 26:14.355
Great, those should take care
of the shark situation.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.705
SONNY: Look, we're down
one swim buddy on this,

26:16.749 --> 26:18.315
so I suggest that everyone

26:18.359 --> 26:19.969
take this seriously.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.626
All right, look,
I know we have lots of questions

26:24.670 --> 26:25.888
after losing Clay,

26:25.932 --> 26:27.194
but it's how we deal
with our shit

26:27.237 --> 26:28.717
after we're knocked down
that makes us Bravo.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.719
No better example of that
right now than Clay.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.547
All right? So, let's go.
We got this.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.983
-Yeah, roger that.
-Come on.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.290
JASON:
Hey.

26:38.118 --> 26:41.687
Your head okay? You don't seem,
uh, like you're into this.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.907
What's up?

26:44.951 --> 26:47.127
Well, I wasn't gonna
say anything

26:47.170 --> 26:49.651
with us spinning up,
but since you asked...

26:50.783 --> 26:52.959
The other warrants
heard buzz that

26:53.002 --> 26:55.091
Command's under pressure
to restructure.

26:55.135 --> 26:58.660
Part of a DoD-wide shift
for the new era of warfare.

27:00.314 --> 27:01.881
Meaning what?

27:01.924 --> 27:04.013
Meaning at least one team
is going to get decommissioned.

27:04.057 --> 27:07.103
Fuck. All right, so did those
rumors-- I don't know--

27:07.147 --> 27:08.757
say which team
was on the chopping block?

27:08.801 --> 27:10.759
No, but we'd be naive

27:10.803 --> 27:12.805
not thinking that
Bravo's in the crosshairs.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.458
-I mean, we're already down man.
-[sighs]

27:14.502 --> 27:16.591
And we got nearly a century
of combat experience

27:16.635 --> 27:18.114
between the rest of us.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.638
So what you're fucking trying
to tell me right now

27:19.681 --> 27:22.466
is that our first op
without Clay

27:22.510 --> 27:25.165
could be our last op ever.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.172
Yeah.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.530
One minute.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.837
ALL:
One minute.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.849
30 seconds.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.415
ALL:
30 seconds.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.952
Green light.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.570
Go, go, go!

28:22.613 --> 28:24.050
Go.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.904
â™ª

29:19.235 --> 29:21.803
JASON: Trent, you're with Sonny.
Ray, Brock, with me.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.110
We planned a dive,
dive the plan, boys.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.576
â™ª

30:19.774 --> 30:21.994
[water sloshing]

30:47.193 --> 30:48.672
That current was murder.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.283
Yeah, my air consumption
was shit.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.241
Swim took 30 minutes longer
than we planned.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.548
-Clock's ticking, boys.
-Go.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.570
Split the train.
Brock, stay in the lead.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.502
That woke up
the damn neighborhood.

31:55.348 --> 31:58.612
SONNY: For the love of all
things holy, this looks...

31:58.655 --> 31:59.830
TRENT:
Heavy.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.745
Bravo 1.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.835
[over comms]:
We're all clear on this side.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.489
JASON [over comms]: Havoc,
this is 1. I pass Cleves.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.274
Three tango kilo.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.233
We can tell the Agency
they're off the hook.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.279
Sounds like they cleaned
the target, no prisoners.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.237
Ahead of you.
Just got off with the CIA team.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.586
They heard the shots. Also heard

32:16.630 --> 32:18.153
they got picked up
on a police scanner.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.419
Bravo 1, be advised

32:23.463 --> 32:25.204
local law enforcement
are aware of activity

32:25.247 --> 32:27.032
on target
and will be responding.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.468
Working on an ETA for you now.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.252
There's a lot of damn crates
out there, Jace.

32:30.296 --> 32:31.645
All right, look, collapse
security, consolidate on me.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.168
We're gonna
be busy tonight, boys.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.127
Let's fucking go.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.218
"Join the Navy," they said.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.784
"See the world," they said.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.134
[grunts]

32:44.875 --> 32:46.921
How's the SSE coming along?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.271
Just ripped the phone lines,
pulled the hard drives.

32:49.315 --> 32:50.707
This place is a gold mine.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.448
DAVIS: Bravo 1,
this is Havoc Base.

32:52.492 --> 32:53.884
Local law enforcement
is ten mikes out. How copy?

32:53.928 --> 32:55.408
JASON:
Good copy, Havoc. 1 out.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.324
Bravo 3, you got five mikes
to set those charges.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.416
Our guests of honor have arrived

33:03.459 --> 33:05.026
for our down-home
Georgia barbecue.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.462
Look, everything in this room

33:06.506 --> 33:07.855
and in this building
has got to be rubble.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.117
-Charges set.
-JASON: All right, let's go.

33:09.161 --> 33:10.771
Let's kick rocks.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.210
Whoa!

33:19.301 --> 33:21.260
Safe in, safe out.
Same swim buddies.

33:21.303 --> 33:22.565
Sonny, how much time
on those fuses?

33:22.609 --> 33:24.698
-Eight seconds.
-JASON: Go, go, go.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.126
Oh, my God. Babe.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.431
-Babe.
-Babe, I-I told you,

35:29.475 --> 35:31.999
okay? Just...
I got to do this myself.

35:33.087 --> 35:35.698
At least take a break.
You're-you're overdoing it.

35:35.742 --> 35:38.484
-That's who I am.
-[Brian crying]

35:43.880 --> 35:45.230

Get down. Patrol boat.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.245
Where the fuck
are Sonny and Trent?

37:27.288 --> 37:28.637
RAY:
That patrol boat ain't out

37:28.681 --> 37:29.595
for a pleasure cruise,
I'll tell you that.

37:29.638 --> 37:30.552
We're chasing daylight.

37:30.596 --> 37:31.771
You think we didn't

37:31.814 --> 37:33.033
give ourselves
enough margin for error?

37:33.076 --> 37:34.339
That swim was hell.

37:34.382 --> 37:35.992
Imagine not operating
for six months.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.733
RAY: Worried Trent pushed
himself to come back too soon,

37:37.777 --> 37:39.082
take Clay's spot?

37:39.126 --> 37:40.606
Yeah, I am.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.395
Nice of you to fucking join us.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.787
SONNY:
Trent ran out of O2.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.267
I had to buddy breathe him
the whole way,

38:33.311 --> 38:34.573
then my rig flooded.

38:34.616 --> 38:35.443
Yeah, I can smell that
caustic cocktail

38:35.487 --> 38:36.705
on your breath, brother.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.011
SONNY: Yeah, that's what
happens when you

38:38.054 --> 38:39.882
swap spit with Trent
for three hours.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.536
[vomits, coughs]

38:41.580 --> 38:42.972
Brock, take us home, buddy.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.191
Let's move. Come on.

38:44.234 --> 38:46.454
Let's get the fuck out of here.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.119
There you go.
Suck on that long neck, Brock.

38:59.162 --> 39:00.381
Gracias.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.209
Thanks for saving
my life, Sonny.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.994
Even at the expense
of your own digestive system.

39:05.038 --> 39:08.171
No, you're lucky. It usually
takes me a handle of bourbon

39:08.215 --> 39:11.958
to be capable of, uh,
that much intimacy with someone.

39:12.001 --> 39:13.829
-Give it up for Aquaman.
-Oh, Brock.

39:13.873 --> 39:15.831
Stop touching me.
Please, stop, stop.

39:15.875 --> 39:16.702
Hey, Davis.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.139
Did we, uh, did we stop

39:19.182 --> 39:20.488
the Cold War from going hot?

39:20.532 --> 39:22.185
Uh, for now, at least.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.492
There's no chatter anywhere
about Americans in the area.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.407
The authorities in Sukhumi
are blaming

39:26.451 --> 39:27.669
careless arms dealers.

39:27.713 --> 39:28.844
Any word on Alpha and Foxtrot's

39:28.888 --> 39:30.498
-targets?
-DAVIS: Dry holes.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.065
Search continues.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.632
Well, at least we're putting up
points on the board.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.198
-Indeed.
-JASON: Yeah.

39:35.242 --> 39:37.462
And the shit ton of SSE
you boys got me will help,

39:37.505 --> 39:40.073
so I'm gonna go
get a head start on that.

39:42.249 --> 39:45.165
Is it just me or you happy
that Foxtrot and Alpha

39:45.208 --> 39:46.949
came up empty on that?

39:48.560 --> 39:50.126
It's just good
to come back home with a win

39:50.170 --> 39:51.780
after being down
for so long, Sonny.

39:51.824 --> 39:53.521
TRENT:
What, uh...

39:53.565 --> 39:56.132
what are you not telling us?

39:57.743 --> 40:00.049
All right, look,
Ray heard some rumors that, uh,

40:00.093 --> 40:02.095
some of the teams
are getting decommissioned.

40:03.488 --> 40:04.880
I just, uh, I just got back

40:04.924 --> 40:06.360
to Bravo, now they're
gonna take it away?

40:06.404 --> 40:07.796
Doesn't matter, okay? Look,

40:07.840 --> 40:10.146
we killed tonight's op,
and that's just gonna

40:10.190 --> 40:12.540
crush any doubts that
Command has on us, right?

40:12.584 --> 40:14.455
Right?

40:14.499 --> 40:16.936
SONNY: Okay. If you think
one mission success

40:16.979 --> 40:19.460
will make up for us
getting blown up twice

40:19.504 --> 40:21.157
in our last handful of ops.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.116
And with the absence of

40:23.159 --> 40:27.250
Clay-rah Fawcett
spreading his youthful glow,

40:27.294 --> 40:29.078
we're DEVGRU old-timers.

40:29.122 --> 40:31.124
Of course they're gonna
stick a fork in us.

40:48.184 --> 40:50.622
NAIMA: This one has a better
kitchen setup,

40:50.665 --> 40:52.624
but this one has better access

40:52.667 --> 40:54.626
to public transportation.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.497
-Mm-hmm.
-And both landlords agreed

40:56.541 --> 40:58.978
not to lease to anyone else
until you got back to see them.

40:59.979 --> 41:02.677
-That's great.
-It's lucky.

41:02.721 --> 41:04.592
There were better contenders
we missed out on

41:04.636 --> 41:06.115
because you and I agreed
not to sign anything

41:06.159 --> 41:09.467
till you were back
to make a decision with me.

41:10.946 --> 41:12.774
Hey.

41:12.818 --> 41:14.559
Are you even listening?

41:15.385 --> 41:17.475
I'm sorry, baby, I... [sighs]

41:17.518 --> 41:20.565
It's something with Bravo's
got my head spinning.

41:21.957 --> 41:24.612
Well, maybe I should
get my job back

41:24.656 --> 41:26.266
and we try this again
when you hit your 20.

41:26.309 --> 41:28.921
When you have time to give it
your undivided attention.

41:31.184 --> 41:34.013
Babe, my 20 just gives us
access to my pension.

41:34.056 --> 41:35.797
It doesn't mean I won't be
dealing with Bravo anymore.

41:35.841 --> 41:38.321
We both agreed that
the vets need us now.

41:38.365 --> 41:40.802
You're not planning
on retiring next year?

41:43.109 --> 41:44.502
Oh.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.068
I-I guess we, uh...

41:46.112 --> 41:47.809
-[scoffs]
-We never discussed what

41:47.853 --> 41:50.464
doing this together
looks like in the long term.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.727
Maybe we should now.

41:55.034 --> 41:56.818
Might not be a Bravo anymore, so

41:56.862 --> 41:58.864
makes the decision easier.

41:58.907 --> 42:00.561
Then what's making it harder?

42:00.605 --> 42:02.781
Jason, babe.

42:03.738 --> 42:05.610
He relied a lot on Clay

42:05.653 --> 42:07.829
before he got hurt, and...

42:07.873 --> 42:10.528
now I don't know who fills
my shoes with Jason

42:10.571 --> 42:12.051
if Bravo survives.

42:13.879 --> 42:16.751
I know this isn't fair to you

42:16.795 --> 42:19.624
right now, but...

42:19.667 --> 42:21.713
I just don't know
what to tell you.

42:23.584 --> 42:25.281
[sighs]

42:26.805 --> 42:28.589
So, look, if we, uh...
[chuckles]

42:28.633 --> 42:29.982
If you hadn't been here
when I got back,

42:30.025 --> 42:31.200
we would not have been able
to do that,

42:31.244 --> 42:32.811
-what we just did.
-[chuckles]

42:32.854 --> 42:34.682
It was very acrobatic of you,
I will say.

42:34.726 --> 42:36.379
MANDY: We could've done
what we just did

42:36.423 --> 42:39.557
at my place, only we wouldn't
have had a dog audience.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.342
Hey, I don't mind, you know,
moving the show to your place.

42:42.385 --> 42:44.823
It'd be good for me to get out
of Vah Beach for a few days,

42:44.866 --> 42:45.998
but the dog's got to come.

42:46.041 --> 42:48.478
-Sorry.
-I can't. I'm, uh...

42:48.522 --> 42:50.872
I took a job.

42:50.916 --> 42:53.571
-What kind of job?
-Going to Afghanistan.

42:53.614 --> 42:55.703
Get female educators to safety.

42:57.139 --> 43:00.186
What, you going after a former
asset, like Burkina Faso?

43:00.229 --> 43:03.232
No, a friend of mine
started an NGO,

43:03.276 --> 43:04.625
recruited me to help.

43:04.669 --> 43:06.975
I'll be protecting people,
not stirring the pot.

43:07.019 --> 43:09.587
Come on.
[whistles]

43:09.630 --> 43:12.633
Water. Good boy. Yeah.

43:12.677 --> 43:15.027
-[sighs]
-You know...

43:15.070 --> 43:17.682
when you thought
I was worried about you

43:17.725 --> 43:19.640
before you spun up,

43:19.684 --> 43:21.599
I was.

43:21.642 --> 43:24.036
But more than that, I...

43:24.079 --> 43:25.428
-was jealous.
-Yeah. No,

43:25.472 --> 43:27.779
I can totally understand
you wanting to run back

43:27.822 --> 43:30.433
into the fire, but, you know...

43:30.477 --> 43:33.088
Cerby's just, he's just
finally loving having you...

43:33.132 --> 43:36.048
you be here,
and everything's just getting

43:36.091 --> 43:38.616
smooth, and...
So how-how long you gone for?

43:38.659 --> 43:39.791
I don't know.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.270
Everything that's
happened to Clay,

43:41.314 --> 43:43.621
you know, me having to deal
with my TBI stuff

43:43.664 --> 43:45.797
and all the treatments...

43:47.276 --> 43:49.452
Everything you've done
for me, it's, um...

43:49.496 --> 43:51.629
God, I would have just,
uh, stepped on some

43:51.672 --> 43:53.152
serious, serious land mines

43:53.195 --> 43:54.588
that would have
blown me up in the past.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.285
[sighs, groans]

43:56.329 --> 43:59.680
-How was this op?
-How was this op?

43:59.724 --> 44:01.551
The guys backstopped you?

44:01.595 --> 44:03.249
-Was your head okay?
-Yeah.

44:03.292 --> 44:05.643
-It's good.
-Just like you promised.

44:05.686 --> 44:07.166
Yeah.

44:07.209 --> 44:10.125
See?
You're gonna be fine without me.

44:10.169 --> 44:11.997
You've got the team
supporting you.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.303
Till Command splits us up.

44:14.347 --> 44:16.958
-What?
-There's a rumor going around

44:17.002 --> 44:19.004
that Command's
gonna break us up.

44:20.266 --> 44:21.528
It's...

44:21.571 --> 44:22.964
-[sighs]
-You know what?

44:23.008 --> 44:24.705
Uh, six weeks ago,

44:24.749 --> 44:25.924
I told them I couldn't get away.
I'll just say

44:25.967 --> 44:27.577
I need a little more time.

44:27.621 --> 44:29.492
[sighs] No. That's good.

44:29.536 --> 44:32.191
It's all right, you go.
People are in danger.

44:32.234 --> 44:33.627
You go.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.977
That's what you do.
That's what we do, so, hey.

44:36.021 --> 44:38.153
It's, uh, you don't
have to worry about me.

44:38.197 --> 44:39.502
I'm not worried about you,

44:39.546 --> 44:42.680
-but if-if you are...
-No, not at all.

44:42.723 --> 44:44.943
I'll be fine. Trust me.
I'll be good. Got this.

44:44.986 --> 44:47.380
All right, Cerby, that's good.
[whistles]

44:47.423 --> 44:48.686
-Speak.
-[barks]

44:58.043 --> 44:59.348
How long have you been...

44:59.392 --> 45:01.481
A minute, 57.

45:01.524 --> 45:03.701
58... 59...

45:03.744 --> 45:06.399
[chuckling] My God, two minutes.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.404
Day and a half, twice my goal.

45:21.370 --> 45:23.938
[sighs]

45:38.736 --> 45:40.346
[Cerberus whines]

45:53.489 --> 45:55.753
DAVIS: Well, I'm still
processing intel from Georgia.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.102
What's your excuse?

45:57.145 --> 45:58.799
You have anything
actionable yet?

45:58.843 --> 46:00.409
No, it's a lot to sort through.

46:00.453 --> 46:01.802
Well, forget actionable.

46:01.846 --> 46:04.239
I mean, uh,
do you have any leads?

46:04.283 --> 46:06.067
Maybe one.

46:06.111 --> 46:07.590
But it's isolated,

46:07.634 --> 46:09.070
and it's not enough
to build a package around.

46:09.114 --> 46:10.768
The IP address
linked to the payment

46:10.811 --> 46:12.770
for the rockets is anonymous,

46:12.813 --> 46:14.597
but we traced it
to northern Syria.

46:14.641 --> 46:16.121
Northern Syria, who's there?

46:16.164 --> 46:19.733
Who isn't? It's the Wild West
of extremist groups.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.866
It's a fucking hornets' nest
to send a team into,

46:21.909 --> 46:23.606
especially with no support
in the region.

46:23.650 --> 46:26.827
So, I'm hoping that the rest
of this intel points elsewhere.

46:26.871 --> 46:30.309
I'm just hoping that, uh,
Bravo Team is still around...

46:31.266 --> 46:34.879
...you know, to be that spear,
wherever you point it.

46:36.489 --> 46:38.447
You hear anything?

46:38.491 --> 46:40.710
Yeah, I mean,
I did some poking around.

46:40.754 --> 46:44.627
Yeah, this decommissioning
is more than a rumor.

46:44.671 --> 46:45.846
Anything on Bravo?

46:45.890 --> 46:48.153
They're part
of the conversation.

46:50.198 --> 46:51.852
Right.

46:51.896 --> 46:53.506
I got to get back to it.

46:55.508 --> 46:57.379
[keypad beeps]

46:57.423 --> 46:59.468
-[door opens]
-I'll see you around.

47:02.167 --> 47:06.167
-[door closes]
-Hopefully.
