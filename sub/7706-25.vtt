00:03.137 --> 00:04.536
Hi, ALF.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.271
Hi.

00:06.273 --> 00:09.975
What does
E-N-N-U-I spell?

00:09.977 --> 00:11.377
Beats me.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.212
What do we send
you to school for?

00:13.214 --> 00:15.314
Beats me.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.782
Can I see the mail?

00:16.784 --> 00:19.318
I'm expecting to hear
from the matchbook people

00:19.320 --> 00:22.187
on how well
I drew Binky.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.722
Here you go, ALF.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.894
"Occupant."
"Resident."

00:31.332 --> 00:33.332
Lingerie catalog.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.268
Kate, you saucy vixen, you!

00:39.006 --> 00:40.172
Uh-oh.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.673
They didn't like
your Binky?

00:41.675 --> 00:45.177
Worse! It's from that
college Lynn wants to go to.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.478
Why is that bad?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.847
The college
is in Massachusetts.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.583
If Lynn goes to college
in Massachusetts

00:51.585 --> 00:53.719
she won't be
living here anymore.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.156
- Hi!
- Hi.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.590
No mail today.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.426
Then what are you holding?

01:01.662 --> 01:02.928
Mail.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.563
I'm a terrible liar.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.698
- Let me see.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.769
- What does E-N-N-U-I, spell?
- Ennui?

01:10.771 --> 01:13.705
Ding ding ding!
That's absolutely correct.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.408
No need for you
to go to college.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.178
Give that to me.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.081
Oh, my gosh, it's here!
Cross your fingers, everybody!

01:22.083 --> 01:23.582
No problem.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.419
Alright!
This is fantastic!

01:27.421 --> 01:29.221
I can't believe it!
I've got to call Laurie.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.789
Yes! Yes!

01:32.560 --> 01:33.926
Maybe she didn't get in.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.763
[theme music]

02:06.060 --> 02:07.826
[music continues]

02:37.458 --> 02:39.658
[instrumental music]

02:43.797 --> 02:45.030
[sighs]

02:46.534 --> 02:49.735
- What was that for?
- Well, nothing.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.374
[sighs]

02:57.478 --> 02:59.511
Is there something wrong?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.980
What could possibly be wrong?

03:01.982 --> 03:03.482
You're moving out.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.817
You won't be living here.

03:05.819 --> 03:09.621
You'll never call,
you'll never write.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.190
ALF, just because
I'm going away to Amherst

03:11.192 --> 03:13.792
doesn't mean you're never
gonna see me again.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.862
What's the matter,
aren't you happy here?

03:18.165 --> 03:19.998
It's Kate, isn't it?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.668
No, and it's not that
I'm not happy here.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.571
It's just that it's time
for me to be out on my own

03:25.573 --> 03:29.508
to make my own decisions,
my own mistakes.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.677
You can make mistakes here.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.912
Take it from one who knows.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.149
I get the point.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.917
You don't want me
to go away to school.

03:39.687 --> 03:43.555
Well, uh, yeah. Sorta.

03:44.358 --> 03:47.859
Oh, ALF!
That's so sweet.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.194
No mush.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.762
Sorry.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.566
Do you know
I'm gonna miss you too?

03:55.502 --> 03:57.903
- You will?
- Uh-huh.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.938
I'll write to you
every week

03:59.940 --> 04:02.941
and I'll even
send you a sweatshirt.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.812
Just send me a regular shirt,
I'll sweat in it myself.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.114
Better idea.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.182
[knock on door]

04:10.184 --> 04:11.483
Come in.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.454
Just in time.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.723
We were discussing sweat.

04:17.725 --> 04:20.859
Which side would
you like to expound?

04:20.861 --> 04:23.895
Could we postpone
the sweat debate?

04:23.897 --> 04:27.633
There's something that Kate
and I wanna discuss with Lynn.

04:27.635 --> 04:31.270
Fine! I'll hie me
to yon refrigerator

04:31.272 --> 04:33.672
and forage
for meat loaf.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.142
Later, dude, dudettes.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.247
Is something wrong?
You guys look upset.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.650
Uh, I'm afraid,
we have some bad news, honey.

04:46.387 --> 04:50.956
I've checked this over
a dozen different ways but..

04:53.127 --> 04:56.728
I-I guess there's no
easy way to say this.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.566
We just can't afford to send you
away to school next year.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.972
When I applied, you said this
wasn't gonna be a problem.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.642
Well, we've had some
complications since then.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.479
- You mean ALF.
- Yeah, I mean ALF.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.282
We counted on my having
a full-time job this past year

05:17.284 --> 05:19.785
but with ALF here,
that just wasn't possible.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.454
And we've had so many
extra expenses

05:22.456 --> 05:26.358
supporting him, you know,
there's food, and breakage

05:26.360 --> 05:28.593
and food..

05:29.963 --> 05:33.999
You can still get a very good
education at a state university.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.102
But you will have
to live at home.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.538
I guess I should have
seen this coming.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.211
If it's any consolation..

05:47.514 --> 05:49.781
...we've had a rare opportunity

05:49.783 --> 05:51.883
living with an alien.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.386
You know, you couldn't get
that at Amherst.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.188
I'll never find out,
will I?

05:57.991 --> 06:01.326
I'm sorry, Lynn,
if you're unhappy.

06:01.328 --> 06:04.963
But you know in life, we can't
always get everything we want.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.499
Oh yeah, dad?
Where did you go to college?

06:07.501 --> 06:08.900
Uh, Amherst.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.570
Oh.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.841
My parents didn't
have an alien.

06:15.843 --> 06:19.745
Give me an L! Give me a Y,
give me an N, N, N!

06:19.747 --> 06:22.180
Now lose the extra N.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.882
What have you got?

06:28.655 --> 06:30.655
Was it something
I spelled?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.825
[instrumental music]

06:36.530 --> 06:37.696
Lynnie, have a cookie.

06:37.698 --> 06:41.166
- No, thank you.
- Oh, boy! More for me.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.701
And me!

06:42.703 --> 06:44.403
You know how to eat these?

06:44.405 --> 06:46.004
Twist off the top

06:46.006 --> 06:48.774
and lick off all
the gooey stuff inside.

06:48.776 --> 06:52.277
Really? That's how
I eat a jar of mayonnaise.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.846
You're right, dad.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.215
I couldn't get this kind
of education at Amherst.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.350
[burps]

07:01.121 --> 07:02.854
Lynn, I know
you're disappointed

07:02.856 --> 07:04.956
but there are a lot
of very fine schools nearby.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.958
You can get a very,
very good education.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.127
But it's not
the same thing.

07:09.129 --> 07:13.198
I wanted to live in a dorm
so I could finally be on my own.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.966
Lynn, we've explained this
to you already.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.437
We can't afford to
send you away to school.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.272
Fine, I'm going to my room

07:20.274 --> 07:23.308
the place I'll be sleeping
for the next four years.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.746
Oh, this is terrible.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.549
Why? You're gonna have
your daughter around

07:30.551 --> 07:33.418
for the next four years.

07:33.420 --> 07:37.222
We would've been happier if
she could have gone to Amherst.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.491
Then you wanted
to get rid of her.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.761
Was it because she drinks
milk right out of the carton?

07:42.763 --> 07:44.663
Of course not.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.665
Phew! Thank goodness!

07:48.101 --> 07:51.136
We didn't want
to get rid of her.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.005
It's just that it's hard
when your child wants something

07:54.007 --> 07:56.741
and you can't
give it to her.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.977
I've got a solution
to your problem.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.813
Oh, please,
clue us in.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.116
Brian, bring me
the family budget.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.453
Or as I like to call it,
gone with the wind.

08:08.455 --> 08:09.988
[laughing]

08:11.925 --> 08:15.293
Alright, what are you doing
with our family budget?

08:15.295 --> 08:19.264
I'm trying to bring some fiscal
sanity into this household.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.770
Thank you,
my trusty sidekick.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.473
You're welcome, Lord Vader.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.275
Uh, Willie, look at this.

08:30.277 --> 08:34.346
A payment to your mechanic
for new brake shoes.

08:34.348 --> 08:37.115
Isn't that a trifle foppish?

08:37.117 --> 08:39.184
Of course.
You're right.

08:39.186 --> 08:43.021
I'd get home a lot faster if
I were unable to stop the car.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.825
And these grocery bills!

08:46.827 --> 08:49.561
Well, we can't touch those.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.397
Although, I might point out
that filet of cat

08:52.399 --> 08:55.400
is cheaper than roast of beef.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.836
Oh, here we are. This is what
I was looking for.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.373
Miscellaneous. $10,000.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.646
Just stop buying
so many miscellaneouses.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.948
What are they,
Greek pastries?

09:11.218 --> 09:14.219
ALF, we weren't gonna
tell you this but

09:14.221 --> 09:19.891
those miscellaneous expenses are
what it costs to support you.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.662
- No.
- I would've guessed higher.

09:23.664 --> 09:28.567
On Melmac you could support
a family of four with that.

09:28.569 --> 09:33.972
On Earth, we used to support
a family of four with that.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.178
So what you're saying is..

09:40.180 --> 09:43.281
...I'm the real reason Lynn
can't go away to school.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.088
I feel like slime.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.224
I feel like slime guts.

09:53.226 --> 09:57.529
I feel like
slime gut droppings.

09:57.531 --> 10:01.800
I feel like slime gut
droppings on an open fire.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.705
How do you feel?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.106
Nauseous.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.509
[instrumental music]

10:15.816 --> 10:17.315
(ALF)
'Kate, Willie?'

10:18.919 --> 10:21.219
Where's the fire extinguisher?

10:27.094 --> 10:29.961
2.1 seconds.
A new record!

10:31.064 --> 10:33.598
- There's no fire.
- I know.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.134
I just wanted
your immediate attention.

10:37.104 --> 10:40.472
You got it.
What do you want?

10:40.474 --> 10:44.976
Well, since it's my fault that
Lynn can't go away to college

10:44.978 --> 10:46.845
I'm gonna do
something about it.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.613
Okay.

10:48.615 --> 10:52.183
Willie, I'm getting you
a night job.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.184
What?

10:53.186 --> 10:54.786
I noticed
you spend your evenings

10:54.788 --> 10:57.455
just hanging around the house.

10:57.457 --> 11:01.426
Yes, I like to call
that living my life.

11:01.428 --> 11:04.696
Call it what you will.
It's a thing of the past.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.165
Now, I've got something
here for you.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.368
It's called,
"men's room attendant."

11:11.805 --> 11:15.507
Do I look like
a men's room attendant?

11:15.509 --> 11:18.977
No, you look like
a scrubbing bubble.

11:18.979 --> 11:22.380
- You have an interview at 9:00.
- I'm not going.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.015
We'll have to build up
his confidence.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.518
I'm not going.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.119
Well, now, Kate, I notice

11:28.121 --> 11:30.889
you yourself are
not gainfully employed.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.392
'To wit, I have several
suggestions.'

11:34.394 --> 11:36.327
Suggestion one.

11:36.329 --> 11:42.400
"Telemarketing.
For interview call 555-Jugs."

11:44.337 --> 11:45.870
Pass.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.739
Suggestion two.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.208
"Be a model
in your spare time.

11:50.210 --> 11:54.913
For interview call 555-Jugs."

11:56.049 --> 11:58.817
Where did you get
this newspaper?

11:58.819 --> 12:01.219
- I called 555-Jugs.
- Juggs.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.521
Suggestion three.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.890
ALF, Kate and I
have all the careers

12:05.892 --> 12:08.393
we can handle
at the moment, thank you.

12:08.395 --> 12:13.164
Alright. How about putting Brian
in a serial commercial?

12:13.166 --> 12:16.267
That Mikey kid
must be pushing 40 by now.

12:18.371 --> 12:22.073
ALF, I appreciate
what you're trying to do

12:22.075 --> 12:24.409
but you've got
to leave this to us.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.947
We-we just have
to make some sacrifices.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.082
Sacrifices?

12:31.084 --> 12:34.085
Well, you're not gonna throw me
in a volcano, are you?

12:38.058 --> 12:41.426
Oh, no, no!
No, of course not. No.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.661
Well, I guess I've got
no other choice.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.232
I'll have to get a job.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.466
You?

12:50.604 --> 12:52.203
Hey, hey, here's something!

12:52.205 --> 12:55.306
Exotic dancer.
I could do that!

12:58.078 --> 13:00.111
ALF, you can't get a job.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.946
Do you remember the time
you tried to earn money

13:01.948 --> 13:04.149
doing phone surveys?

13:04.151 --> 13:07.285
- Yeah.
- 'How much money did you make?'

13:07.287 --> 13:08.419
None.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.388
How many policemen
came to the house?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.892
Eleven.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.326
Enough said.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.629
- Goodnight, ALF.
- Night, ALF.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.130
Goodnight.

13:23.436 --> 13:27.806
Oh, hey.
Here's the job for me.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.341
And what a majestic title!

13:30.343 --> 13:33.411
It sounds like a superhero.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.180
Paper-Boy!

Now that you're up,
could I see the two of you

14:03.710 --> 14:04.809
in the living room?

14:04.811 --> 14:06.211
[groans]

14:06.213 --> 14:10.114
ALF, we're tired now.
We wanna go to sleep.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.384
Fine, but I don't know
how you two can sleep

14:13.386 --> 14:17.388
considering what's
in the living room.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.135
[gasps]

14:31.137 --> 14:33.037
- What!
- What are these?

14:33.039 --> 14:36.174
Newspapers, Willie.
Get with it!

14:36.176 --> 14:38.343
Why are they here?

14:38.345 --> 14:40.845
Perhaps I should explain.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.414
- Please do!
- No, no, let me guess.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.351
You're a newspaper boy.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.220
Well, we prefer the term
paper person.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.089
It's gender-neutral.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.359
Do you actually believe

14:54.361 --> 14:56.828
that you can afford to send
someone through college

14:56.830 --> 14:58.663
with a paper route?

14:58.665 --> 15:02.934
No. That's why I
got 10 paper routes.

15:02.936 --> 15:08.206
Oh, 10 paper routes?
There must be 500 papers here.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.376
Well, actually, 501.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.078
They gave me
an extra copy by mistake.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.747
[chuckles]

15:15.749 --> 15:19.217
ALF, you can't
deliver newspapers.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.685
Well, sure, I can!

15:20.687 --> 15:22.654
You haven't
seen my throwing arm.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.259
Willie, I can't throw you
and the newspaper.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.197
Well, you two
better get dressed.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.234
Why?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.069
If these papers
aren't delivered

15:38.071 --> 15:40.605
500 people
won't get their news.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.741
Their weather,
their Doonesbury.

15:43.743 --> 15:47.578
Well, nobody
ever gets Doonesbury.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.181
It's become self indulgent,
don't you think?

15:51.151 --> 15:53.418
Willie..

15:53.420 --> 15:55.420
Willie, no, Willie,
I hate to say..

15:55.422 --> 15:58.389
Willie, we're gonna have
to deliver these papers

15:58.391 --> 16:00.992
500 people want
their newspaper.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.294
And I wanna win
a new bicycle.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.166
Alright.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.102
Alright. Help me
load them into the car.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.571
Uh, listen,
on your way home

16:13.573 --> 16:16.607
could you pick me up
a an Egg McMuffin?

16:16.609 --> 16:19.444
(Kate)
'Freeze, paperboy!'

16:19.446 --> 16:22.747
- Me?
- You're coming with us.

16:22.749 --> 16:26.017
- What, are you crazy?
- I can't deliver papers.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.854
- Someone might see me.
- That's their tough luck.

No, no, no. Wait, wait.'

16:44.304 --> 16:46.838
Uh, might be this one.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.172
No, no, no, no!

16:48.174 --> 16:50.108
Oh, yeah, yeah! It is,
it is. Right here.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.809

as to define..

Wrong house.

Again.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.965
Hey, what do I look like,
The Amazing Kreskin?

17:13.967 --> 17:15.933
It's dark out there.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.744
Want me to drive
for a while?

17:29.015 --> 17:31.716
[instrumental music]

17:33.386 --> 17:37.021
Okay, Willie,
make a left here.

17:37.023 --> 17:40.258
Oh, no, no!
Right, right.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.694
Oh, no, no. Go straight.
Go straight.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.697
Okay, now, now right.
Make a right now.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.599
Right. Why aren't you turning?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.601
Well, there's
no intersection!

17:51.171 --> 17:52.804
Good answer.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.509
(Kate)
We haven't delivered
a paper in 15 minutes.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.412
ALF, are you sure you know
where we're going?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.615
ALF?

18:06.619 --> 18:09.620
[snoring]

18:13.726 --> 18:16.027
[sighs]

18:16.029 --> 18:17.495
Last one.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.232
Well, it's about time!

18:21.234 --> 18:23.601
- Kate?
- Raquel.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.238
You're up early.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.575
Are you our
new paperboy?

18:30.577 --> 18:33.478
We prefer paper person,
it's gender-neutral.

18:34.814 --> 18:39.383
Kate, hey, Kate, you should have
told us you were destitute.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.918
Oh, no, Raquel.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.420
We're just earning
a little extra money

18:42.422 --> 18:44.122
to send Lynn away to school.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.623
Uh-huh. Sure.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.759
Well, if you and the family
ever have to sleep in your car

18:48.761 --> 18:51.362
please feel free
to park on our front lawn.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.665
Right next to
Trevor's cousin.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.402
Someone lives in
that Volkswagen?

18:58.404 --> 19:00.671
No, not the Volkswagen,
the jeep.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.574
Well, brr.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.516
[instrumental music]

19:16.623 --> 19:18.623
Raquel saw me
delivering her paper.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.791
She thinks
we're destitute.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.293
Destitute?

19:22.295 --> 19:25.863
I got a job,
I got a paper route

19:25.865 --> 19:29.133
I got an interview
at 9:00 a.m.

19:29.135 --> 19:33.538
Look alive! The evening
edition will soon be here.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.040
No more editions,
no more paper routes

19:36.042 --> 19:40.444
no more ink on my fingers.
This madness must stop.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.979
Hey, come on!

19:41.981 --> 19:43.614
What's four years of sleep

19:43.616 --> 19:46.017
compared to our
daughter's happiness?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.153
She's not our daughter.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.222
I mean she's our daughter.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.324
She's not our daughter.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.459
- Who's not your daughter?
- You.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.828
Since when?

19:57.830 --> 20:01.499
Lynn, of course
you're our daughter.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.168
Well, biologically
you're their daughter

20:04.170 --> 20:07.371
but I will be giving you away
at your wedding.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.839
I may not be having a wedding.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.209
And if I do, it will probably
be in my bedroom.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.078
Okay. That's it, Lynn!

20:14.080 --> 20:16.080
Yeah, you're grounded!

20:16.849 --> 20:18.416

Under the table, ALF.

- 'Oh, hi, Kate.'

20:26.025 --> 20:29.927

'Uh, Raquel, we don't
need this food.'

20:29.929 --> 20:34.065
(Raquel)
'Well, you can't
live on pride. Bon appetit.'

20:35.535 --> 20:37.935
Who is she,
Julia Child?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.105
What was that all about?

20:42.108 --> 20:44.542
Raquel thinks
we're destitute.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.110
Why would she think that?

20:46.112 --> 20:49.380
She saw me deliver
her newspaper this morning.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.349
What?

20:51.351 --> 20:54.952
Oh! ALF got a paper route.

20:57.890 --> 21:02.026
Oh, correction,
he got 10 paper routes.

21:03.396 --> 21:07.765
He wanted to try to raise enough
money to send you to college.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.702
Yeah, and Kate and Willie
were my assistants.

21:11.704 --> 21:15.740
Not my cheerful
assistants mind you.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.743
You guys stayed up all night
delivering newspapers?

21:18.745 --> 21:21.212
Well, two-thirds
of us did.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.483
See what I mean about
the cheerful part?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.286
You did that for me?

21:28.288 --> 21:33.491
Yeah, and the 10-Speed
which I won't be winning.

21:35.561 --> 21:38.929
I've been acting
like such a brat.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.431
I'm sorry.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.899
You're still grounded.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.737
I guess I could go
to college around here.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.839
- You could?
- Yeah.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.442
A lot of my friends are
going to state schools.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.110
It can't be that bad.

21:53.112 --> 21:56.947
Attagirl!
Eat your words.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.817
You never know, maybe in a year
or two I'll be able to transfer.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.086
Well, sure, honey.
Who knows?

22:02.088 --> 22:05.323
Meanwhile, we'll
be living like kings

22:05.325 --> 22:10.461
on the Ochmonek's chickpeas
and cocktail onions.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.798
ALF, you can eat it all.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.568
Okay. But I gotta tell ya,
there's tripe in there.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.973
Sweetheart, I'm so glad
you understand.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.109
Moosh alert!

22:25.111 --> 22:30.348
ALF, come on!
Sometimes moosh is nice.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.982
Oh, alright.

22:31.984 --> 22:36.287
Willie, I love you more
than chickpeas and tripe.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.657
The feeling is mutual.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.859
[instrumental music]

22:44.997 --> 22:47.531
Well, here's a place
you can save money.

That's our fire
insurance premium.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.603
$3000 a year?

22:53.840 --> 22:56.640
You know, it was
only $300 a year

22:56.642 --> 22:59.577
just before you moved in.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.746
Talk about inflation.

23:04.384 --> 23:09.520
Oh, look at this one.
Dental visits twice a year.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.055
You know what that costs?

23:11.057 --> 23:14.058
Forgive us, ALF,
we're fond of our teeth.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.927
Trust me.
You can get by on four.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.599
Pet supplies?

23:21.601 --> 23:23.667
Well, I've got
a solution to that one.
