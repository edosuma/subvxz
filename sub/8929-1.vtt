01:04.176 --> 01:06.977
RATTRAP: Oh, man. This is ridiculous.

01:07.077 --> 01:10.877
We're an exploration ship, not a battle cruiser.

01:10.977 --> 01:14.112
No choice. Our ship was the only one

01:14.212 --> 01:16.412
that could lock onto Megatron's warp signature.

01:16.512 --> 01:18.779
CHEETOR: Shields are doing a major fade.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.446
OPTIMUS: Plasma cannons to full power.

01:23.346 --> 01:27.147
DINOBOT: Their shields are down. Destroy them!

01:27.247 --> 01:29.214
Now where's the fun in that?

01:29.314 --> 01:32.281
A little torment, I think, first. Yes.

01:32.381 --> 01:33.748
Side gun.

01:43.983 --> 01:46.150
Aah!

01:46.250 --> 01:48.984
Agh! Rupture. The stasis hold is failing.

01:49.084 --> 01:52.551
No. We're going down.

01:53.651 --> 01:56.551
Launch all pods. Get them into safe orbit.

03:05.597 --> 03:07.663
Believe me, you don't wanna know.

03:07.764 --> 03:09.964
( sighing ): That's what I thought.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.867
Navigation, is this the right planet?

03:24.967 --> 03:27.033
NAVIGATION: Unknown.

03:27.134 --> 03:30.501
Course settings were accurate, but readings are inconsistent

03:30.601 --> 03:33.567
with those expected for intended destination.

03:33.667 --> 03:38.069
Never mind that. Tell me there is energon here.

03:38.169 --> 03:39.236
Confirmed.

03:39.336 --> 03:43.603
Yes. The planet has energon.

03:43.703 --> 03:45.337
Too much energon.

03:45.436 --> 03:48.170
Field readings are off the scale.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.637
Continued exposure to robotic forms

03:50.737 --> 03:53.471
will result in permanent damage.

03:53.571 --> 03:55.405
( grunts )

03:55.505 --> 03:58.972
Then we will create alternate forms

03:59.072 --> 04:02.706
based on the most powerful local creatures.

Hey, hey, look at me. I'm a cheetah!

04:58.549 --> 05:02.649
No, no. I'm Cheetor.

05:02.749 --> 05:05.550
Hmm. Interesting.

05:05.650 --> 05:07.083
Interesting?

05:07.183 --> 05:08.650
( growls )

05:08.750 --> 05:13.718
Optimus, the word is "spot-on smooth."

05:13.818 --> 05:17.885
( purring, laughing ): It's a crime.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.886
Little bit tacky.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.286
Heh, you never had taste, did you, kid?

05:22.386 --> 05:23.386
Now this,

05:23.486 --> 05:24.386
( growls )

05:24.486 --> 05:26.486
this is what class is all about.

05:26.586 --> 05:29.521
Call me Rattrap.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.721
Oh, yeah? How's about I cut meeces to pieces?

05:32.821 --> 05:34.687
Ease back, Cheetor.

05:34.788 --> 05:39.789
Living large is for forms like me, Rhinox.

05:39.889 --> 05:41.322
Yeah! Heh!

05:41.423 --> 05:45.257
And just consider yourself lucky I didn't get rough on youse.

05:45.356 --> 05:48.757
Moderate your conflict circuits, Maximals.

05:48.857 --> 05:51.590
Remember, these beast forms are to protect us

05:51.690 --> 05:55.191
from the long-term effects of the energon fields out there.

05:55.291 --> 05:57.658
We may need energon for power,

05:57.758 --> 06:01.058
but this is too much of a good thing.

06:01.159 --> 06:03.559
Our robot forms will start to short out

06:03.659 --> 06:06.427
after a few minutes' exposure.

06:06.527 --> 06:10.127
This is one unusual planet.

06:10.227 --> 06:11.561
Whatever it is.

06:14.694 --> 06:16.062
RHINOX: Or whenever.

06:16.162 --> 06:20.228
The trans warp drive can go through space and time.

06:20.328 --> 06:22.996
We were locked onto Megatron's warp signature.

06:23.096 --> 06:27.063
We could be any place, any time.

06:27.164 --> 06:30.564
Yes, and our crew is orbiting the planet

06:30.664 --> 06:33.098
in those stasis pods we lost in battle.

06:33.198 --> 06:35.931
They're protected from the energon fields,

06:36.031 --> 06:39.065
but it means Megatron has us outnumbered.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.166
( suspenseful theme playing )

06:48.467 --> 06:52.600
No, no, no! It's all wrong.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.268
This cannot be Earth.

06:55.368 --> 06:59.302
Megatron, you failed.

06:59.402 --> 07:03.136
Not only did you fail to destroy the Maximals

07:03.236 --> 07:04.502
when you had the chance,

07:04.602 --> 07:07.937
you failed to bring us to the right planet!

07:08.037 --> 07:12.271
We stole the Golden Disk for nothing.

07:12.371 --> 07:14.905
You idiot.

07:15.005 --> 07:17.405
( disk clangs )

07:17.505 --> 07:19.906
I beg your pardon?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.939
What did you call me?

07:22.039 --> 07:24.939
You heard. You are an idiot

07:25.039 --> 07:26.973
and an incompetent leader.

07:27.073 --> 07:29.940
And I am taking over.

07:30.040 --> 07:33.808
Dinobot terrorize!

07:35.375 --> 07:37.475
( roars )

07:39.176 --> 07:41.842
I challenge you to battle, Megatron.

07:41.942 --> 07:44.976
The winner shall lead the Predacons

07:45.077 --> 07:49.177
and the loser shall be destroyed.

07:49.277 --> 07:53.311
Oh, you're so impulsive, Dinobot.

07:53.411 --> 07:56.077
Brave, but misguided.

07:56.178 --> 07:58.678
Do you accept my challenge?

07:58.778 --> 08:00.978
( laughs )

08:01.078 --> 08:04.579
There's more to being a leader than simple courage.

08:04.679 --> 08:08.780
Well, there's cleverness and cunning as well.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.614
Isn't that right, Scorponok?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.649
Loser.

08:20.749 --> 08:23.216
What does it matter which planet we're on?

08:23.316 --> 08:24.650
We came looking for energon,

08:24.750 --> 08:27.483
and this planet is rich with the element.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.083
Enough energon to power

08:29.184 --> 08:31.918
the Predacons' entire galactic conquest.

08:32.017 --> 08:35.351
Only the Maximals could give us trouble now.

08:35.452 --> 08:37.752
If they survived the crash.

08:37.852 --> 08:39.251
Find them.

08:39.351 --> 08:41.718
And if you find them,

08:41.819 --> 08:43.553
destroy them.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.254
( dramatic theme playing )

08:56.354 --> 08:58.022

08:58.122 --> 09:01.823
Man, all this for a Golden Disk.

09:01.923 --> 09:04.190
( beeping )

09:04.290 --> 09:06.923
It was Cybertron's most carefully guarded relic,

09:07.023 --> 09:08.156
Rattrap.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.357
It gave the location of a major energon source.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.357
That's why Megatron stole it.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.658
Yeah, like I care.

09:15.758 --> 09:19.592
You know, we were supposed to be doing deep space exploration.

09:19.692 --> 09:23.259
Huh. Playing galactic patrol was nowhere in my job description,

09:23.359 --> 09:24.726
you know what I'm saying?

09:24.826 --> 09:26.560
You sure you're cut out for this commander gig?

09:26.660 --> 09:29.860
( sighing ): Remember the Great War, Rattrap?

09:29.960 --> 09:34.128
If the Predacons get enough energon, they'll start it again.

09:34.228 --> 09:36.662
We can't let that happen.

09:36.761 --> 09:39.161
Besides, you wanted exploration,

09:39.261 --> 09:42.162
and here we are on an unknown planet.

09:42.262 --> 09:43.396
What more do you want?

09:43.496 --> 09:45.063
Well, call me picky,

09:45.162 --> 09:47.863
but a working spacecraft might be nice.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.030
( sighs )

09:49.130 --> 09:51.031
Just no pleasing some people.

09:55.031 --> 09:56.598
Hey, check it.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.399
( sighing ): They're fast, all right.

10:01.499 --> 10:02.799
You chose a good form.

10:02.899 --> 10:04.599
Hey, you think that's speed?

10:04.699 --> 10:06.400
You ain't seen the golden rocket.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.500
Check this.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.133

10:17.302 --> 10:19.235

10:20.502 --> 10:23.169
Cheetor, return to base immediately.

10:23.269 --> 10:24.769
We don't have time for this.

10:26.036 --> 10:28.670
OPTIMUS: Cheetor? Please respond.

10:28.770 --> 10:33.170
No good. The energon fields mess up the comm links.

10:33.270 --> 10:36.938
Anything over a hundred meters, they ain't worth scrap.

10:37.038 --> 10:40.472
Well, that's just prime.

10:40.572 --> 10:43.506
So, uh, is this your first day on the job or what?

10:43.606 --> 10:45.040
Shut up, Rattrap.

10:45.139 --> 10:48.873
Oh, yes, sir. You know, I feel just heaps better

10:48.973 --> 10:52.874
knowing that our lives are in your capable hands.

10:52.974 --> 10:54.341
We're all gonna die.

10:55.441 --> 10:57.575

10:57.675 --> 11:00.075
The name's Cheetor. What's shaking, cats?

11:00.175 --> 11:02.275

11:03.609 --> 11:05.443

11:24.513 --> 11:27.313
Hey, what? It's just a big bug.

11:27.413 --> 11:31.714
Huh. The way those two reacted, that's no natural life form.

11:31.814 --> 11:35.148
And if we're talking unnatural life forms,

11:35.248 --> 11:37.582
then we gotta be talking about just one thing.

11:37.682 --> 11:41.648
Robots in disguise! Cheetor, maximize!

11:41.748 --> 11:43.616

Hey, heads up. Roadblock.

12:47.793 --> 12:51.060
Veer left. There's a clearing about a hundred meters.

12:54.528 --> 12:55.994

12:58.361 --> 13:00.795
Ah, yes. Silly me.

13:11.396 --> 13:12.697

13:12.797 --> 13:15.865
Oh, of all the times for a quasar jam!

13:15.965 --> 13:17.098
OPTIMUS: Cheetor!

13:17.198 --> 13:20.899
Get to cover! We'll swat that pesky Predacon.

13:20.998 --> 13:25.266
MEGATRON: Oh, I would not count on that, Maximals.

13:25.366 --> 13:26.299
No.

13:26.399 --> 13:28.033
( laughs )

13:28.132 --> 13:32.601
For I believe that you are soon to have...how shall I put it?

13:32.701 --> 13:35.868
Difficulties of your own.

13:35.968 --> 13:37.934
Yes.

13:42.935 --> 13:45.669
We don't have to do this, Megatron.

13:45.769 --> 13:46.970
There has been peace

13:47.070 --> 13:50.570
between the Maximals and Predacons for centuries.

13:50.670 --> 13:53.238
Why start this up again?

13:53.337 --> 13:56.771
Peace, perhaps on your side, Maximal scum.

13:56.872 --> 14:00.272
Yes. But not on ours.

14:00.372 --> 14:01.838
Permit me to inform you

14:01.938 --> 14:05.839
that an enemy which appears to be peaceful

14:05.939 --> 14:09.740
may, in fact, be merely biding its time.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.440
( gun beeps )

14:11.540 --> 14:12.840
( snarling )

14:12.940 --> 14:14.307
Finally!

14:14.407 --> 14:16.875
We Predacons have never abandoned

14:16.975 --> 14:19.408
our rightful goal of galactic conquest.

14:19.509 --> 14:24.976
No. We have merely been waiting for the right moment...

14:25.076 --> 14:26.409
to strike.

14:26.510 --> 14:28.810
You mean like this?

14:28.910 --> 14:31.010
( roars )

14:31.110 --> 14:32.177
Cheetor!

14:32.277 --> 14:36.644
Ah! A treacherous, underhanded sneak attack.

14:36.744 --> 14:37.844
( laughs )

14:37.944 --> 14:39.912
I like you, pussycat.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.645
Yes.

14:41.745 --> 14:43.346
But it shall avail you not.

14:43.446 --> 14:48.146
No. From now, the power gauntlet has been cast.

14:48.247 --> 14:50.980
Predacons, terrorize!

14:51.080 --> 14:53.480
Do it. Maximize!

14:53.580 --> 14:56.515
Tarantulas, terrorize!

14:56.615 --> 14:59.249
( giggling )

14:59.348 --> 15:02.282
Rhinox, maximize!

15:02.382 --> 15:06.283
( roars )

15:06.383 --> 15:09.817
Scorponok, terrorize!

15:09.917 --> 15:13.884

15:13.984 --> 15:17.951

16:22.762 --> 16:25.563
Rattrap, help Cheetor. We'll cover you.

16:25.662 --> 16:29.429
Heh, yeah, right!

16:29.530 --> 16:31.130
That's an order, Rattrap!

16:31.230 --> 16:35.531
Yeah, and you can just kiss my skid plate, fearless leader,

16:35.631 --> 16:37.064
'cause I ain't going out there

16:37.164 --> 16:38.931
and getting my pelt punctured.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.398
( growls )

16:41.498 --> 16:43.466
( fire roaring )

16:46.766 --> 16:48.233
( grunting )

16:49.333 --> 16:51.433
( grunting )

16:53.134 --> 16:54.567
( grunts )

16:54.667 --> 16:56.767
Optimus!

16:56.867 --> 16:59.268
Heh-heh, see? Told you!

17:00.701 --> 17:02.402
( gasps )

17:04.002 --> 17:05.769
Ah!

17:07.103 --> 17:09.837
Do not let them escape!

17:15.237 --> 17:19.005
Hey! Let me down, you big bulldozer.

17:19.105 --> 17:23.039
Cover fire. They need it, we give it. Now.

17:24.372 --> 17:26.306
( yelling )

17:30.506 --> 17:33.307
Back to the base. Let's go, let's go!

17:35.541 --> 17:37.807
After them! Go, you--

17:37.908 --> 17:40.408
( grunts )

17:48.910 --> 17:51.243
One cannot...

17:53.377 --> 17:58.811
Energon field buildup. Convert back to beast mode.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.780
( growls )

18:10.880 --> 18:14.147
Hey! Hey, what's got your Servo so bent?

18:14.247 --> 18:16.247
Let's get one thing straight, Rattrap.

18:16.347 --> 18:17.681
I am commander of this group,

18:17.781 --> 18:20.649
and when I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed.

18:20.748 --> 18:23.615
Oh, yeah? So I get vaped

18:23.715 --> 18:25.949
because you're too chicken to go yourself.

18:26.049 --> 18:30.449
I will not give an order I would not be willing to do myself.

18:30.550 --> 18:33.784
But I was capable of giving you better cover fire.

18:33.883 --> 18:35.851
You were not.

18:36.851 --> 18:37.884
( grunts )

18:37.984 --> 18:41.218
Hey, come on. What are you shorting about?

18:41.318 --> 18:43.386
We got out of there alive, didn't we?

18:43.485 --> 18:44.885
But injured.

18:44.985 --> 18:46.419
It'll take time for our beast forms

18:46.519 --> 18:48.920
to affect internal repairs.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.786
Yeah, well,

18:50.886 --> 18:53.253
better you than me.

18:53.353 --> 18:55.487
( suspenseful theme playing )

18:57.454 --> 18:59.888
I think we gave them the fade, Optimus

18:59.988 --> 19:01.188
Keep your sensors on full.

19:01.289 --> 19:03.789
According to the Golden Disk theft reports,

19:03.888 --> 19:05.789
there were six Predacons.

19:05.889 --> 19:07.789
One of them was missing from the battle.

19:07.889 --> 19:11.423
Yeah, well, uh, maybe it was destroyed in the crash.

19:11.523 --> 19:15.324
That kind of luck we haven't been getting much of lately.

19:15.424 --> 19:18.424
Tell me about it. Look.

19:26.659 --> 19:28.459
Should we blast him?

19:28.560 --> 19:32.260
Keep that option open. But hang on.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.127
Attention, Maximals.

19:35.227 --> 19:38.061
My name is Dinobot.

19:38.161 --> 19:42.662
I have left the Predacons to join your group...

19:42.762 --> 19:44.229
as leader.

19:44.329 --> 19:47.629
What? Did I hear the word "leader"?

19:47.729 --> 19:51.597
This guy's got bearings of chrome steel.

19:51.697 --> 19:55.730
I hereby challenge you, Optimus Primal,

19:55.830 --> 19:58.698
to a one-on-one battle.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.932
The winner shall lead the Maximals.

20:02.032 --> 20:07.300
And the loser shall be destroyed.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.733
NARRATOR: Next time, on Beast Wars:

20:12.833 --> 20:14.334
Fire!

20:21.135 --> 20:23.602
Energon. Yes.

20:23.702 --> 20:25.602
With a crystal that size,

20:25.702 --> 20:28.603
the Predacon forces will be unstoppable.

20:34.771 --> 20:36.470
It's gonna blow!

20:40.405 --> 20:41.772
Beast Wars.

20:42.805 --> 20:44.872
( dramatic theme playing )
