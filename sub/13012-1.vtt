<font color="#ffff00"> <i>After everything we've seen,</i> </font>

00:46.520 --> 00:49.796
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>there isn't much that rattles
either of us anymore.</i> </font>

00:52.320 --> 00:53.851
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>But this one...</i> </font>

00:55.240 --> 00:57.470
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>This one still haunts me.</i> </font>

01:12.320 --> 01:14.151
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>Two months prior to our involvement,</i> </font>

01:14.320 --> 01:17.517
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>the Lutz family had fled their home
in the middle of the night,</i> </font>

01:17.720 --> 01:20.393
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>claiming that the house was haunted.</i> </font>

01:23.320 --> 01:26.153
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>The Church had reached out to us for help.</i> </font>

01:26.600 --> 01:27.794
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>They wanted to see</i> </font>

01:27.960 --> 01:31.589
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>if we could confirm the activity
that had been reported by the Lutzes.</i> </font>

01:35.320 --> 01:37.011
Ok. We ready?

01:38.480 --> 01:40.032
Then let's get started.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.979
I'd like you to sit quietly
and close your eyes.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.700
Envision yourself in a halo
of glowing white light.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.811
It will protect you.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.631
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>The year before the Lutzes moved in,</i> </font>

02:06.800 --> 02:08.791
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>a young man named Ronny DeFeo</i> </font>

02:08.960 --> 02:12.270
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>had brutally murdered his
entire family in this house.</i> </font>

02:13.120 --> 02:14.473
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>We'd hoped to discover</i> </font>

02:14.640 --> 02:17.677
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>if the killings had been
motivated purely by anger</i> </font>

02:17.840 --> 02:19.239
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>or if,</i> </font>

02:19.400 --> 02:21.709
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>as Ronny DeFeo testified in court,</i> </font>

02:21.880 --> 02:26.032
<font color="#ffff00"> <i>he had been under the influence
of something demonic.</i> </font>

03:05.200 --> 03:08.875
<i>Stay here. Stay.</i>

03:33.480 --> 03:36.199
<i>Kill her. Kill her.</i>

03:38.320 --> 03:39.878
<i>Shoot them.</i>

03:40.040 --> 03:41.678
<i>Shoot them!</i>

03:41.840 --> 03:42.840
<i>Shoot her!</i>

03:43.320 --> 03:46.630
<i>What did you do?</i>

03:46.880 --> 03:48.190
<i>Shoot her. Kill her.</i>

03:48.280 --> 03:49.474
<i>Shoot her!</i>

04:03.360 --> 04:05.351
<i>Shoot them all.</i>

04:06.040 --> 04:07.155
<i>Shoot!</i>

04:13.680 --> 04:14.680
<i>Kill!</i>

04:35.320 --> 04:37.276
<i>Kill her. Shoot her.</i>

04:37.440 --> 04:41.149
<i>Kill her. Shoot her.</i>

04:52.040 --> 04:54.235
Honey, you Ok?
What are you seeing?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.189
Lorraine.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.153
Lorraine, what is happening?

05:32.080 --> 05:33.593
I have to see.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.927
We're through. We're through.
It's time to come back.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.675
What is happening?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.591
It wants to show me.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.680
Lorraine!

07:12.080 --> 07:13.115
Lorraine!

07:13.600 --> 07:15.268
Oh, God!

07:16.280 --> 07:17.280
Honey.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.839
Honey.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.669
It's Ok.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.554
It's Ok.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.480
Ed.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.029
This is as close to hell
as I ever wanna get.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.874
Damn kids!
Really.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.075
Yeah.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.120
Oh, my gosh.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.750
Keith and I are going to sneak
out tonight with his friend, Michael,

09:05.840 --> 09:07.512
who wants to meet you, by the way.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.229
No way.
If my mum ever found out, I'd be dead.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.153
So don't get caught, you priss.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.469
Here, hold this.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.839
Gotta give you back
the spirit board that we made.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.593
I think I'll let Keith French kiss me.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.637
What? No way!

09:26.800 --> 09:28.000
What you two doing?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.915
Janet, give that to me.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.838
And get inside, both of you.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.480
Go.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.718
Margaret.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.472
Margaret! Johnny!

09:54.640 --> 09:55.789
Janet! Billy!

09:57.920 --> 10:00.088
Hello. How was your day?

10:00.680 --> 10:01.715
Not good.

10:01.920 --> 10:02.955
Why? What happened?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.111
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
All right, then.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.669
What's up?

10:08.920 --> 10:10.558
Billy?

10:10.760 --> 10:11.954
Shut up, Peter.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.120
Lesbo!

10:13.280 --> 10:14.872
What, are you talking about your mum?

10:16.720 --> 10:17.948
Thank you, Camilla.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.275
No problem!

10:19.600 --> 10:21.875
He's just a wanker. Ignore him.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.680
Ok.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.190
Mum's gonna kill me.
What did you do now?

10:30.280 --> 10:31.952
It wasn't me, it was Camilla.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.678
What did you do with Camilla?

10:34.040 --> 10:35.230
It's a long story.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.038
Boys!
Watch the road!

10:40.680 --> 10:42.671
Janet!
Up you go, Billy.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.120
Come on.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.456
I'm saying I won't be able
to pay my rent this month.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.439
No. I talked to them,
and they put me through to you.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.400
<i>Please keep calm...</i>

10:57.520 --> 10:59.238
I am being calm.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.234
Well, I don't understand
why you can't help me.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.715
No.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.347
No. He hasn't paid a penny
of child maintenance for three months.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.639
We're home! I see.
That's bloody brilliant.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.495
Hi, Mum!
You have a good afternoon as well.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.080
Janet.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.630
Are things not bad enough around here,

11:20.720 --> 11:21.770
that I've got to get a call,

11:21.795 --> 11:24.699
from your headmistress who says
that you was caught smoking?

11:24.700 --> 11:27.055
I wasn't! I wasn't smoking. I promise.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.150
Did you get the biscuits?
Did you just not hear me?

11:29.240 --> 11:30.670
I talked to Mrs. More on the telephone.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.310
How can you stand there
and lie to me like that?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.400
I'm not lying!

11:33.560 --> 11:35.710
Yes, she is! It's all over the school.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.030
She was smoking with Camilla.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.031
Shut up! You are such a liar, Johnny!

11:39.440 --> 11:41.795
Mum!
You said we would get me some...

11:42.000 --> 11:43.750
No, Billy. I didn't get any bloody biscuits

11:43.840 --> 11:45.717
because we don't have any bloody money!

11:57.800 --> 11:58.915
Mum's coming.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.330
You better quit messing with that
and brush your teeth!

12:01.800 --> 12:02.994
All right.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.678
Sounds like the whole city's
burning down in here.

12:10.840 --> 12:11.955
Look what I found!

12:12.120 --> 12:13.394
Biscuits!

12:14.320 --> 12:17.118
But you said we don't have any money.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.475
Well, I've been meaning
to quit smoking anyway.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.312
Margaret?
Yes?

12:21.480 --> 12:23.914
Have you got your
school uniform for tomorrow?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.519
Yes, Mum. I'm getting it.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.312
Johnny, did you brush your teeth?

12:27.480 --> 12:28.674
I did it already.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.836
Come on, Billy.
Time for bed.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.754
Coming, Mum.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.835
Put that down, Johnny.
Come on. Time for bed.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.912
Oh, where'd that come from?

12:48.320 --> 12:50.390
Camilla and I made it at school.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.830
That doesn't look right.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.673
It really works, I swear.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.035
We already asked it all sorts of stuff.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.872
Come on, I'll show you.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.198
All right.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.748
What should I ask?

13:05.280 --> 13:07.157
I don't know. Whatever you want.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.320
Ok.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.516
My sister and I want to know...

13:14.760 --> 13:17.718
Are there any spirits here
that want to communicate with us?

13:29.280 --> 13:30.954
Is Dad ever coming home?

13:38.560 --> 13:41.552
Are there any spirits here
who can answer my question?

13:52.880 --> 13:54.029
Don't worry about it.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.952
It's just a stupid game.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.120
It isn't real.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.396
Why are you pounding on the door?

16:06.560 --> 16:08.312
I'm not.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.833
You're barmy.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.551
You know, she's pushing the boundary,
isn't it?

16:15.720 --> 16:17.070
She says she wasn't smoking.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.435
I don't think you should
agonize over it, Peg.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.478
God knows I had my share
of fags at school, didn't you?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
Oh, lots.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.510
But it's not what she did that bothers me.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.319
It's that, she don't listen
to what I say anymore, Pegs.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.596
Just a phase, isn't it?

16:30.840 --> 16:33.099
I mean, I can punish her,
but then I feel guilty

16:33.100 --> 16:34.977
because I know it's not really her fault.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.354
She loves her dad,

16:37.920 --> 16:40.398
and she took it very hard
when he left. Poor thing.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.359
But I can't just let it go either, can I?

16:44.560 --> 16:47.393
I'm loath to ask, but have you
told Richard about it?

16:47.400 --> 16:48.913
I would, if I ever saw him.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.469
Sod.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.390
Now, it's like I'm having to do both jobs.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.682
I'm half the mum I was before.
I'm just...

16:55.107 --> 16:56.259
rubbish, Peggy.

16:56.540 --> 16:58.895
You are not, Peggy.
You're too hard on yourself.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.635
This sodding house.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.714
<i>We are back with real life ghost hunters,</i>

17:16.720 --> 17:18.353
<i>Ed and Lorraine Warren,</i>

17:18.359 --> 17:21.670
talking about their experiences
at the Amityville house.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.115
And now we're gonna talk to my next guest,

17:24.319 --> 17:25.912
<i>Dr. Steven Kaplan,</i>

17:26.240 --> 17:28.999
<i>who says that the investigations
the Warrens conducted</i>

17:29.000 --> 17:32.390
<i>into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.</i>

17:32.680 --> 17:33.999
Why is that?

17:34.280 --> 17:38.034
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.710
But that hasn't stopped...
That's never been proven.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.835
Yes, it has.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.417
The Lutz family made everything up

17:42.560 --> 17:44.679
so they could profit off of all the publicity.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.113
<i>That's just not true.</i>

17:46.280 --> 17:47.952
<i>Look, we see this all the time.</i>

17:48.160 --> 17:51.719
It's very easy to sit on the outside
and pick apart their story.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.119
But it's something very different

17:53.120 --> 17:55.204
to have been there and
experienced it for yourself.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.630
I don't need to go to the moon

17:56.720 --> 17:59.109
to know that it's not
made out of green cheese.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.149
Listen, Ed Warren's never seen a house
that he didn't think was haunted.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.790
<i>And by the time his wife is done
blowing smoke and ringing bells</i>

18:06.960 --> 18:09.520
they've got everybody else
believing in ghosts, too.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.389
What exactly are you a doctor of, anyway?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.870
Come on, Warren.
Try and show a little class, will you?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.230
I'm not gonna show class to somebody

18:15.320 --> 18:16.750
who's sitting here telling
lies about my wife and me.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.590
Be careful who you call a liar.
What are you gonna do about it?

18:22.920 --> 18:25.039
We go on these shows to inform people.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.582
But every time I open my mouth,
another one of these little...

18:27.720 --> 18:28.833
Ed.
Ass...

18:29.400 --> 18:30.628
Academics...

18:31.360 --> 18:32.509
Pops up.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.318
Tries to undo everything we've done.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.710
Could you please take a breath?
I know. I know. I know.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.716
I'm counting to 10. I'm counting to 10!

18:44.120 --> 18:45.120
All right, Billy.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.872
You ready to do a speech?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.635
It's all right. 
We'll just try again.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.040
You ready?

19:24.680 --> 19:25.829
Good boy!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.799
You're getting so good.
Now you may have a biscuit.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.028
Biscuit!

19:30.200 --> 19:31.243
All right. Come on.

19:31.268 --> 19:32.419
Off to bed with you.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.600
Night, Mom.
Good night, darling.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.311
Now, don't eat too many of those

19:40.480 --> 19:42.710
or you'll wake up thirsty
in the middle of the night. All right?

19:42.800 --> 19:44.153
I won't.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.389
You promise?

19:47.840 --> 19:49.637
Night, boys.
Night, Mom.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.010
No.

21:11.680 --> 21:12.874
Help.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.639
Stop it.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.229
No.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
Janet?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.472
Please.
Janet?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.118
Janet, wake up! You're dreaming.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.190
This is my house.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.436
No. No, it's not.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.028
Go away.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.949
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

21:47.520 --> 21:49.511
Playing a game with Billy.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.159
Leave Billy alone.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.878
Janet, who are you talking to?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.599
You have to go away.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.120
You're the one trespassing.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.309
Janet, wake up.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.676
I'll tell my mum if you don't stop.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.320
I'll break her neck.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.112
No, please.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.316
Dying with Billy.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.520
No.

22:08.840 --> 22:09.840
Janet.

22:10.300 --> 22:11.610
Janet, it's all right.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.318
It's all right, come on.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.879
Go back to sleep.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.718
Stay away from Billy!

22:52.880 --> 22:54.233
Leave us alone. You hear me?

22:54.400 --> 22:56.834
Janet, what are you doing?
There's no one here.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.277
This is my house.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.956
Mum! Mum!

26:27.400 --> 26:29.755
Mum! Mum!

26:30.040 --> 26:31.393
Billy? What's wrong?

26:31.600 --> 26:33.591
There's someone in my tent!

26:33.840 --> 26:34.840
What?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.514
There's someone in my tent!

26:44.120 --> 26:45.120
Mummy.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.559
See? Nothing.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.995
You just had a bad dream. That's all.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.588
Go to your room.

27:41.580 --> 27:42.854
Oh, my God.

27:42.920 --> 27:43.920
Janet!

27:44.160 --> 27:47.038
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
What're you doing down here?

27:49.720 --> 27:51.997
I think I've been sleepwalking again.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.672
What do you mean again?

27:54.400 --> 27:55.435
You all right?

27:56.640 --> 27:57.953
You're burning up.

27:58.478 --> 27:59.383
Come on.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.715
Come on, let's get you back upstairs, Ok?

28:03.320 --> 28:05.754
Think you better stay home
from school tomorrow.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.880
Come on. Let's get you back into bed.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.077
Hodgson residence.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.517
Hi, Mum.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.918
Yeah, a little.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.872
I just ate, so I'm not really that hungry.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.353
Yeah. I'm here.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.836
Do you know when you'll be home?

30:33.120 --> 30:34.120
All right.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.948
Bye, Mum.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.519
Yes, I am an iron lady.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.497
My house!

32:27.960 --> 32:29.473
You're up early.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.715
Hey. Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.359
You get inspired?

32:34.520 --> 32:36.231
I don't know if I'd call it that.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.598
I had this crazy dream.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.314
Saw this thing.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.753
When I woke up...

32:42.600 --> 32:44.670
Couldn't get it out of my head.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.032
So, thought maybe this might help.

33:04.240 --> 33:07.471
Hey, I know I'm no Picasso,
but I didn't think it was that bad.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.719
We need to stop.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.750
We could still do the lectures,
but no new cases.

33:27.420 --> 33:28.797
At least not for a little while.

33:29.840 --> 33:30.898
All right.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.954
Could I ask why?

33:35.040 --> 33:37.776
Because if it's the TV shows and publicity,

33:38.001 --> 33:39.535
then we won't do that.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.991
Good morning.
Good morning.

33:42.680 --> 33:43.715
Morning.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.998
Do you trust me?

33:54.040 --> 33:55.553
You know I do.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.557
Then please trust me now.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.319
Ok.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.469
What are you doing that for?

34:23.080 --> 34:25.435
In case I go sleep walking again.

35:51.560 --> 35:52.560
Mum?

35:57.880 --> 35:59.233
Johnny?

38:52.760 --> 38:55.194
Janet! What's wrong? What is it?

38:55.360 --> 38:57.237
There's someone in the room!

38:58.640 --> 39:00.437
There's no one!
What you talking about?

39:10.240 --> 39:11.832
There's someone in our room!
What!

39:12.040 --> 39:13.415
Our beds are shaking up and down!

39:13.560 --> 39:14.710
Janet, I swear to God if you're making it up...

39:14.800 --> 39:16.756
I got bit. I'm not lying!
He bit me! Look!

39:17.920 --> 39:19.194
Oh, my God.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.192
Have you two been playing with this?

39:44.400 --> 39:46.595
Taking turns scaring the wits
out of each other?

39:46.760 --> 39:48.470
No wonder I can't get a good night's sleep!

39:48.560 --> 39:50.790
But, Mum...
No! I don't wanna hear another word.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.757
Now get back to bed, the lot of you!

40:03.680 --> 40:04.749
Help us!

40:04.960 --> 40:06.951
Please help!
Help!

40:07.160 --> 40:09.594
Peggy! Vic, open the door!

40:09.800 --> 40:10.915
Open the door!

40:11.240 --> 40:12.992
I've seen it with my own eyes.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.116
The bloody thing
went clear across the room.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.320
But...

40:17.600 --> 40:19.431
Well, then...
What? Well?

40:19.840 --> 40:21.674
It's cold.
Well, I've been through the house.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.951
Top to bottom. There's no one there.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.950
What about Margaret and Janet's room?
Did you...

40:26.040 --> 40:27.600
No, no. I looked there, every room.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.470
Even went down the basement.
There's no one there.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.920
What's he doing?

40:31.360 --> 40:34.352
We've taught him to ring the bell
when he wants to go.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.360
Do you wanna let him out, Billy?

40:45.280 --> 40:48.272
Look!
The police are at our house!

40:48.600 --> 40:50.272
Now, what they doing here?

40:50.480 --> 40:52.277
Oh, I called them.
What?

40:52.520 --> 40:55.230
Well, I mean, it's got to be somebody
playing a joke on you, right?

40:55.320 --> 40:56.833
It's got to be. Yeah.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.914
So, ma'am. You didn't actually
see the man yourself?

41:28.080 --> 41:29.354
No.

41:29.560 --> 41:32.677
But I don't think she's making it up.
Not anymore.

41:33.160 --> 41:36.072
Well, look.
There has to be some sort of explanation.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.595
Sir, that's why we're here, Ok?

41:59.520 --> 42:01.476
Bring me a chair from the kitchen.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.437
It's coming from inside the wall.

42:25.520 --> 42:26.665
Then what?

42:26.690 --> 42:28.054
Mice, maybe?

42:28.160 --> 42:29.878
Big bloody mouse.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.760
Well, there's nothing we can do about that.

42:44.920 --> 42:47.753
We can file an incident report
and we'll stand by it if anyone asks.

42:47.960 --> 42:48.960
But that's about all.

42:49.120 --> 42:49.893
A report?

42:50.318 --> 42:53.882
That's brilliant. Every problem I have,
there's another bloody form to fill out!

42:53.920 --> 42:55.239
Oh, for God's sake.

42:56.960 --> 42:57.995
Listen.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.873
I think this is a bit beyond us.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.677
The priest at our church is a family friend.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.159
I'll ask him to call on you.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.720
Judy?

44:14.680 --> 44:15.680
Honey...

44:17.800 --> 44:19.028
What's wrong?

44:19.680 --> 44:20.715
Mom.

44:22.880 --> 44:24.359
Who's that?

44:33.560 --> 44:34.709
Go back.

48:02.360 --> 48:03.729
Who are you?

48:08.320 --> 48:09.819
Tell me who you are!

48:09.880 --> 48:11.791
Mom! Mom. Mom! Wake up!
No!

48:11.960 --> 48:13.029
What do you want?

48:19.880 --> 48:22.155
I'm sorry, Lorraine.

48:30.200 --> 48:31.474
Are you Ok?

48:33.320 --> 48:34.673
I'm Ok.

48:51.480 --> 48:52.515
Mrs. Hodgson.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.040
Yes?

48:54.580 --> 48:55.580
My name's Kent Allen.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.908
We're with the television
news program Wide Angle.

48:58.120 --> 49:00.489
I was hoping to have a word
with you about the...

49:00.814 --> 49:02.759
disturbance at your home last week.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.519
How'd you find out about that?

49:04.680 --> 49:07.399
The police constables filed
an incident report. It's...

49:08.240 --> 49:09.673
Well, it's raised a few eyebrows.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.508
I'd rather not have my business
spread all over the telly,

49:15.720 --> 49:17.039
if you don't mind. Good day!

49:17.200 --> 49:20.351
Is it still happening? Because if it is
getting your side of the story out

49:20.560 --> 49:22.516
might be your best chance of finding help.

49:25.720 --> 49:27.597
This thing on? Ok.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.831
<i>Behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house</i>

49:30.900 --> 49:32.299
<i>in Ponders End, North London,</i>

49:32.700 --> 49:34.770
<i>is a family living in a nightmare.</i>

49:34.800 --> 49:38.713
<i>I look up, and through the window,
plain as day, I see the younger girl,</i>

49:38.880 --> 49:42.077
<i>Janet, being thrown around in the air
like she was floating.</i>

49:42.680 --> 49:44.555
<i>So we run back inside and sure enough</i>

49:44.579 --> 49:47.030
<i>there's little toy LEGO bricks
flying all around the room.</i>

49:47.120 --> 49:49.588
<i>One of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood.</i>

49:49.760 --> 49:52.399
<i>I saw the chair slide by itself,</i>

49:52.560 --> 49:55.233
<i>across the floor,
a distance of several feet.</i>

49:55.400 --> 49:58.790
<i>I checked the chair for wires,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.230

50:04.400 --> 50:07.073
<i>Well, I don't think there's
any doubt about it at all.</i>

50:07.240 --> 50:10.118
<i>The sheer number of documented
incidents in this case</i>

50:10.280 --> 50:12.032

50:26.760 --> 50:29.593

<i>What happened next will astonish you.</i>

50:33.040 --> 50:36.112
<i>How does it feel living in a haunted house?</i>

50:37.360 --> 50:38.793
I don't know.

50:38.960 --> 50:40.791
You don't get used to it.

50:40.960 --> 50:44.270
You see, we was just a normal family
before all this.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.684
It's been getting worse
since Mr. Grosse started talking to it.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.789
How do you mean?

50:50.280 --> 50:52.396
Like, asking it questions.

50:52.560 --> 50:54.790
Saying knock twice for yes
and one for no.

50:54.960 --> 50:56.359
That sort of thing.

50:56.520 --> 50:59.159
I wonder what would happen
if we tried talking to it now?

51:00.680 --> 51:02.159
Is anybody there?

51:03.800 --> 51:06.678
Is anybody there
who wishes to communicate?

51:14.120 --> 51:15.951
I say again, is anybody there?

51:20.840 --> 51:21.840
Nothing.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.752
Well, it isn't a jukebox, is it?

51:43.840 --> 51:44.909
Janet, are you all right?

51:53.880 --> 51:55.313
Janet?

52:04.520 --> 52:05.714
Janet.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.476
Janet, are you feeling all right?

52:11.960 --> 52:14.030
Stop calling me Janet!

52:15.120 --> 52:16.872
Isn't that your name?

52:17.960 --> 52:20.110
Janet's asleep,

52:20.880 --> 52:24.077
and I'm talking.

52:29.600 --> 52:31.431
Well, what should I call you?

52:44.400 --> 52:46.118
What is your name?

52:48.480 --> 52:50.835
You don't belong here.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.118
My name is Maurice Grosse.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.600
Who are you?

52:59.440 --> 53:01.317
This is my home.

53:01.800 --> 53:03.438
Get out now!

53:03.960 --> 53:07.839
No. This is not your house.
Now, what's your name?

53:09.480 --> 53:11.118
Knock, knock.

53:13.840 --> 53:14.955
Very well.

53:16.320 --> 53:17.639
Who's there?

53:19.680 --> 53:21.796
Bill. Bill.

53:22.440 --> 53:23.793
Bill. Bill.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.189
Bill who?

53:28.280 --> 53:35.118
My name is Bill Wilkins
and I'm 72 years old.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.558
Where do you come from?

53:41.200 --> 53:44.158
I come from the grave.

53:45.320 --> 53:46.958
How did you die?

53:49.720 --> 53:52.871
I went blind and had a hemorrhage.

53:53.080 --> 53:57.471
And I fell asleep
and I died in the chair in the corner.

54:00.200 --> 54:02.475
Why have you come here?

54:05.040 --> 54:07.235
I like to hear them scream.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.511
Why don't you just leave us alone?

54:13.680 --> 54:15.333
Shut up, you old cow!

54:26.840 --> 54:27.989
Janet, darling.

54:28.520 --> 54:29.748
Darling, are you all right?

54:29.920 --> 54:31.000
I'm sorry.

54:31.520 --> 54:32.555
Janet.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.360
Peggy, what am I gonna do?

54:46.760 --> 54:49.115
You don't need to think about it tonight.

54:49.280 --> 54:51.714
And you and the kids can stay here
as long as you like.

54:51.880 --> 54:53.279
Mum.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.634
Billy, aren't you supposed
to be getting ready for bed?

54:57.520 --> 54:59.875
I thought you might like some biscuits.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.879
Oh, thank you!

56:37.960 --> 56:39.791
Baron?

56:57.240 --> 56:58.719
Baron?

57:40.960 --> 57:42.598
Mum! Mum!

57:42.920 --> 57:44.558
Mum! Mum!

57:44.720 --> 57:47.234
What happened? What is it?
The Crooked Man!

57:47.480 --> 57:49.310
What? Crooked what?
What are you talking about, darling?

57:49.400 --> 57:50.790
The Crooked Man!
Calm down!

57:50.880 --> 57:52.240
Just tell me what happened.

57:52.400 --> 57:53.549
What?
What is it?

57:53.720 --> 57:55.720
I don't know.
I think he's been walking around...

58:29.760 --> 58:30.954
Janet!

58:31.920 --> 58:33.114
Janet?

58:33.320 --> 58:36.118
Oh, my God! No!

58:36.440 --> 58:38.829
Someone get an ambulance!

58:41.760 --> 58:43.671
<i>This is my home.</i>

58:43.840 --> 58:45.637
<i>Get out now.</i>

58:45.800 --> 58:49.918
<i>No. This is not your house.
Now, what's your name?</i>

58:50.640 --> 58:52.119
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

58:52.480 --> 58:55.119
<i>Very well. Who's there?</i>

58:57.280 --> 58:59.350
<i>Bill. Bill.</i>

58:59.640 --> 59:01.437
<i>Bill. Bill.</i>

59:02.480 --> 59:03.959
<i>Bill who?</i>

59:04.720 --> 59:11.432
<i>My name is Bill Wilkins
and I'm 72 years old.</i>

59:14.120 --> 59:15.473
What do you make of that voice?

59:16.920 --> 59:18.194
He sounds confused.

59:18.920 --> 59:20.273
Is he senile?

59:21.520 --> 59:23.556
The voice on this tape,

59:24.320 --> 59:26.993
is coming from an 11 year old girl.

59:34.680 --> 59:36.989
The family's reached out
to the Church for help?

59:37.200 --> 59:38.200
Yes.

59:38.360 --> 59:41.750
But truthfully, we've been
reluctant to get involved.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.359
The case has turned into
a media circus over there.

59:44.360 --> 59:46.557
They're calling it England's Amityville.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.120
Great.

59:48.180 --> 59:49.399
You're afraid it's a hoax.

59:49.680 --> 59:53.434
The Church's ability to help people
depends on its reputation.

59:54.600 --> 59:56.459
So, what do you want us to do?

59:56.560 --> 59:58.312
We'd like you to fly to London

59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.599
for three days to act
as our unofficial eyes and ears.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.990
Now, you don't have to do anything.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.033
If it is a hoax,
you just turn around and leave.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.599
But if it's not...

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.439
Then there is a family in London
that desperately needs our help.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.080
Thank you for your faith in us.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.032
All right. Well, just let me know.
Ok.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.713
I told him we'd talk about it.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.798
There's nothing to talk about.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.075
Honey, you heard him.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.670
They don't want us to get involved.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.193
Just observe and report back.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.197
There have always been cases
we've turned down.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.654
There has never been a family
that we've refused to help.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.556
I had a vision in Amityville.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.076
It was the same one I had seven years ago.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.070
I had a premonition of your death.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.074
Wait. That's why you locked
yourself away for eight days?

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.229
You saw my death?

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.998
You've seen it, too.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.160
The demon in your painting is real.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.153
We have both seen
the same inhuman spirit.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.914
It's a warning. If we keep doing this,

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.672
you are going to die.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.749
Your visions are a gift from God.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.336
And if God is showing you my death,
then he's doing it for a reason.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.748
Maybe you're meant
to prevent it from happening.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.973
Come on.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.756
We don't run from fights.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.639
If we go.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.278
If we do this.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.677
You have to promise me
that we're just there to observe.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.834
If anything turns out
dangerous in any way,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.117
we're gonna tell the Church,
and we're gonna get out.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.508
Promise me.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.472
Promise me, Ed.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.113
I promise.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.199
Mr. and Mrs. Warren, I'm Maurice Grosse.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.191
Thank you so much for coming.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.788
I believe you're gonna be staying
at the Hodgsons' house.

01:02:22.889 --> 01:02:24.879
Is that right?
Always better to be in the mix.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.313
Oh, yeah. I agree.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.030
You didn't have to do this.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.997
So kind of you.
It was a complimentary...

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.714
This is it.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.519
Here we are.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.720
There we go.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.019
Ed, we've managed to capture
some amazing things.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.011
I think you'll be very
impressed when you see.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.878
Great. I'd like to listen
to those tapes again, too.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.282
You've got some really
interesting stuff in there.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.033
Vic Nottingham.
Hi, Vic.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.475
How are you? Ed Warren.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.740
Hello, Ed.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.555
Hello. Hi.
And this is Peggy, Peggy Hodgson.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.150
Nice to meet you. Ed Warren.
How do you do?

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.670
This is my wife, Lorraine.
How do you do?

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.113
Hello.
Hello.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.430
Well, I'll be off then, Peg.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.830
Will you tell the kids I said hello?

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.470
Yeah. Of course, I will.
Nice to meet you.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.630
Nice meeting you.
You too, hon.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.888
So, here we are, Peggy.
All right. Do come in.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.431
It's just me and Janet here now.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.272
My other kids are staying with them.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.597
This is where the girls used to sleep,
but we don't use it anymore.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760
Why not?

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.030
Well, most of the activity
centered in this room.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.390
We were quite afraid
that someone might get hurt,

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.039
which is why we keep it locked.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.071
I understand that Janet has levitated.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.350
Did that happen in here as well?

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.690
Yeah, more than once.
Yeah.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.350
We've got photographs of that as well.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.477
I'd like to hear Mrs. Hodgson's story
from her, if you don't mind.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.632
The neighbors donated them
and I hung them up,

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.075
hoping they'd keep things
from moving around.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.593
Has it worked?

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.354
No. We can hear it all night.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.876
Hi, there. I'm Lorraine.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.792
Mind if I have a seat?

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.249
Do you know why I'm here?

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.434
Well, your mom has told me
about what's been going on

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.790
and I'm here to help, if I can.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.433
Would you like to talk about it?

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.339
You know, when I was about your age,

01:04:58.564 --> 01:05:00.681
I was visiting my mom at a hospital,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.070
and I saw an angel.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.389
Yeah.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.194
It was standing next to a little boy's bed.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.353
It was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.158
And it looked right at me.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.312
Of course, my mom and the nurses
did not believe me,

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.078
but I knew it was real.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.832
Look, I know how it is.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.990
I know what it's like to lose your friends
because you're different.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.755
But I also know that
one person can change everything.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.673
And you just have to open up to them.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.710
How did you know you could trust
the people you opened up to?

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.474
I didn't.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.472
Sometimes I got hurt.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.878
And it took a long time but...

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.358
I finally found someone
who believed me.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.476
What did you do then?

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.473
I married him.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.711
I'm just so tired.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.392
I can't sleep here.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.021
I used to go to the medical room
at school,

01:06:40.046 --> 01:06:41.934
and they let me sleep there,

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.591
because I was so worn out.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.630
But now I can't even do that.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.308
Everyone's afraid of me.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.478
I got no friends.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.676
No place I can go to.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.599
It makes me feel like I'm not normal.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.956
You know, whatever is doing this to you
wants you to feel this way.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.113
But why?

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.317
Because that's what makes it stronger.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.400
Around the time this all started,

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.472
Janet started waking up here
in the middle of the night.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.119
This is the spot that Janet said
Bill Wilkins died, right here.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.471
Where'd you get it from?

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.950
My ex-husband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.999
If you don't mind me asking,

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.197
Is your ex-husband still in the picture?

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:46.460
Nope.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.879
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.916
Any chance of reconciliation?

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.992
He had twins with a woman
from round the corner.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.310
So I'm gonna take that as a no.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.535
Yeah, it's been a lot to deal with.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.160
He took all the music the day he left.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.910
I know it must feel like that sometimes...

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.250
No. I mean, literally.
He took all the records.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.837
My kids used to love listening
to his Elvis collection.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.430
They've been through so much.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.258
And now, all this is happening on top.

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:20.902
Yeah. The timing isn't a coincidence.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.654
Negative entities often
feed off emotional distress.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.790
They like to kick you when you're down.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.270
That hardly seems fair.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.872
No, it really isn't.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.510
Do you know when
the voice is gonna speak?

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.118
Sometimes.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.479
And when it does,

01:08:38.502 --> 01:08:41.189
does it feel like it's
coming from inside you?

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.960
No.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.555
More like it's coming from behind me.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.477
Like I'm being used.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.116
Does it ever say things just to you?

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:59.310
That only you can hear?

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.037
What does it say?

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.868
It said it wants to hurt you.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.233
When did it say that?

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.399
Right now.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.278
Do we really need that?

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.477
We'd like to be able to prove to the Church

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.229
that she's not making the voice herself.

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:40.670
So, by holding the water in her mouth,

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.796
we'll be able to show
that it's not some form of ventriloquism.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.158
Does she have to be in the chair?

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:47.399
Just...

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.670
It makes me sick to see her
sitting there like that.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.670
We know it's hard, but the spirit
has shown an attachment to this spot.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.752
It'll be easier for Ed to contact it
if she's sitting there.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.272
You'll be all right.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.189
You ready for this?

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.119
I guess so.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.333
It's December the 21 st, 1977.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.736
This is Ed and Lorraine Warren,
sitting with Peggy and Janet Hodgson.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.995
Also present is Maurice Grosse.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.351
All right. Let's get started.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.470
If there's something here that would
like to communicate with us,

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.630
we're all ears. Speak up.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.834
What do you want
with this girl and her family?

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.397
It says it won't talk with you
all looking at me like this.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.338
Strange! I wonder why not?

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.994
It's not been shy about
talking up until now.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.812
How about if we all turn our backs?

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.514
Think it'll speak if we do that?

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.600
Maybe.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840
Well...

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.910
Let's try this again.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.952
So what do you think, Bill?

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.678
We've given you your privacy.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.598
Now come on out and talk to us.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.233
Here I come.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.916
Am I talking to the spirit
that's oppressing this family?

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.597
Is that what I am?

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.797
Is that what I'm doing?

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.520
Yes.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.910
And I have come to put a stop to it.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.598
Do you know who I am?

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280
Ed.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.909
Eddie.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.514
Edward.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.350
Ed is fine.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.958
Your father called you Edward.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.509
Not true.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.950
My father called me Ed,
just like everybody else.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.870
Come on, Bill.
You're not a psychiatrist

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.630
and I'm not here to talk about my father.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.870
Let's get down to business,
what do you say?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.518
Why don't you
just leave these people alone?

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.788
Because this is my house!

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.991
It's not your house.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.878
Yes, it is.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.995
I come here to see my family,

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.835
but they're not here now.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.831
That's because you're dead.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.833
If your family did live here,
they're long gone now.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.872
Where are they?

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.832
I don't know.
If I did, maybe I could help you.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.837
I don't need your help.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.990
Then why don't you just move on?

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.110
I don't believe in that.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.076
Why not?

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.188
What would be so wrong
with going to heaven?

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.413
I...

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.074
am not...

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.753
a heaven man!

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.271
Well, I got news for you, Bill.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.870
You see, I don't care what you believe in.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.560
You see this?

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.310
Help... it... let... go.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.715
Help... It... Let... Go!

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.473
Are you sensing a presence?

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.119
No, just the opposite.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.162
I'm not sensing anything.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:31.110
We could be looking at hysterical neurosis.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.875
That would explain
the multiple personalities

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.473
and hallucinations.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.431
That doesn't feel right, either.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.795
Well...

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:43.111
I can't explain it.
My heart is telling me to believe them.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.714
I heard that voice with my own ears,

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.713
but all I can sense is their own fear.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.110
I can't seem to see beyond that.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:11.479
I don't think I can sleep
this far away from you.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.388
Well, you're gonna.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.996
It'll give you something
to look forward to when we get home.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.989
Oh, love. I wish you wouldn't do that.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.912
It helps me sleep.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.991
At least I know I'm not going anywhere.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.032
I didn't smoke, Mum.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.395
That day with Camilla at school.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.278
I was holding the cigarette,

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.635
but I wasn't going to take a puff, I swear.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.473
I just wanted to look cool in front of her.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.073
It was stupid.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.794
Oh, love.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.914
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.632
Oh, darling.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.200
Help!

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.635
Help!

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.115
Janet!

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.709
Janet?

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.029
Oh, my God.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.519
Janet?

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.829
Janet?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.069
Help!
Janet?

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.600
Janet!

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.080
Please help me!

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.434
Mum!

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.433
Please! Mum!

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.637
Janet!
Help! Get me out!

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.869
There's somebody in here!

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.234
I can't open it!

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.635
Mum!

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.871
Help me!

01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.080
Janet!

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:01.960
Janet!

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.680
What's going on?
There's someone in there with Janet!

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.872
I can't get it open!

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.758
Get the key. Go get the key now!

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.954
Janet! Hold on! We're coming!

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:19.871
I got the key! I got the key!

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.109
Ok. Ok.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800
Come on.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.795
Janet, we're coming!

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.440
Janet.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.870
Get it off her! Please get it off her!

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:37.959
What was that?

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.799
There was someone in here!

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.312
I saw him with me own eyes.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.040
He did this to my girl.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.834
This is the bite wound
Janet received the first night.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.515
It's faded a bit here,
but you can still make it out.

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.211
That's pretty distinctive.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.675
Two missing teeth.

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.550
That's right and it's too big
for one of the children.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.274
You think this was the spirit?
This Bill Wilkins?

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.079
I tracked down the home owner.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.435
And it turns out,
the owner's father lived there.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.794
His name was William Wilkins

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.912
and he died of a hemorrhage
in the brain in that chair.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.839
Everything she said is true.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.499
All public information, by the way.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.847
She could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.720
And what about the claims

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.190
that Janet has been
teleporting around the house

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.349
in her sleep?

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:37.478
About as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.836
Were any of you there when it happened?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.070
No. But I have pictures of that too.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.753
Yeah. There you go.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.031
I set my camera up in the girls' room

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.316
and then waited downstairs
with the remote control.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.715
And fired it off whenever
I heard any commotion.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.278
I have to admit...

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.791
The way her knees are bent,
the upright position of her body.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.270
It looks like she's just jumping.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.310
What are you saying?
I mean, you were there last night.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.650
You saw it with your own eyes.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:05.190
Well, Peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking Janet.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.669
But she teleported herself into a room

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.035
locked from the outside,
for goodness' sake.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.832
And what about her voice?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.353
How do we explain that?

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.193
I think the first time
she was making that voice

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.277
it was in front of television cameras.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.230
And she couldn't do it
with water in her mouth

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.469
until you looked away.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.458
So she could have spit it out,

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.452
taken another sip before you turned back.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.835
Last year, I was conned by a Welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons.

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.599
Honestly, I don't know what was worse,

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.657
the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.979
The demons...

01:23:39.204 --> 01:23:40.222
are worse.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.431
But you must admit, it is suspicious.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.036
You sincerely believe
that she's faking everything?

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.235
And what about Peggy?

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.799
She's just using the
whole thing as an excuse

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.552
to get better housing from the council.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.078
She's already applied!

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.196
Look, I'm not saying it's a hoax.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.013
Sometimes, what we do requires 
a leap of faith.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.252
To believe when nobody else will.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.596
So you really do believe them?

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.510
Yes. We do.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.677
But the Church can't do anything 
without proof.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
That's what we need.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.119
Right, listen. 
I'll make some telephone calls,

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.719
see if I can get hold of some
video recording equipment.

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.799
Ok, in the meantime,
Ed and I can be spending time

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.935
with Peggy and the kids,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.716
because they need to be a family again.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.279
Hi, Mom! We're back!

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.630
What are you doing back?

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.148
What's all this, then?

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.730
Mr. and Mrs. Warren bought us some vinyls.
They got us an Elvis record!

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.173
Oh, Blue Hawaii.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.959
Hope you don't mind.
A little American culture.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.960
Not at all!
Janet!

01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.420
Billy.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.479
I missed you.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.809
Hey, guys, I missed you.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.188
So, have any of you ever been
bothered by a bully?

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.509
Pete, at school.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.511
He's always picking on Billy.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.247
And, dear, tell me, what do
you do when that happens?

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.190
They stick up for me.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.394
Good, because the spirit in this house
is a lot like that bully.

01:25:00.419 --> 01:25:00.856
Yes.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.439
And he's got it in for Janet.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.931
So you guys gotta stick up for her,
the same way they stick up for you.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.394
Family sticks together.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.029
This, on the other hand, is a lost cause.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.429
Oh, bloody hell.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.453
We've had all sorts of things stop
working for no reason at all.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.632
We're gonna have music in here
one way or another.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.359
Whose guitar is that?

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.555
Oh, it was Dad's,
but he said I could have it.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.620
Yeah, do you mind?

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120
Yeah.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.074
I'm a little rusty,
so you gotta promise not to laugh.

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:37.894
Especially you.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.678
Thank you.

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.549
Hey, don't laugh now.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.936
Everybody now.

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.114
Thank you very much.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.678
It's so small and light.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.759
Why do you do this?

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.192
Help people like us?

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.501
When you were little,

01:27:53.526 --> 01:27:56.812
did you ever worry that there might be
something hiding under your bed at night?

01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.771
Well...

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:01.980
My bed,

01:28:02.805 --> 01:28:04.463
actually had something under it.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.280
Yeah.

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.153
Something grabbed my hand
and yanked me right to the floor.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.293
It was too dark to see under there,

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.476
but let me tell you,
I ran out of there so fast.

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:14.874
You know what my dad did?

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.193
He dragged me right back into the room
and told me I had to face my fears.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.155
And I was scared to death.

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:26.719
But then I remembered
what this nun had told me in catechism.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.079
God will be there for all who need..

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:32.515
So...

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.550
I grabbed this crucifix
out from my nightstand, right?

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.831
And I tell whatever's under there,

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.631
that it better leave,
or God was gonna kick its butt.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.558
Best thing my dad ever did for me.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.720
Of course he only did it
because he really didn't believe me.

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:55.075
It took me years
to finally find someone who did.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.778
And you know what I did then?

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.594
You married her?

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.852
So you've heard this story before?

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.168
All right.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.712
How you getting on in here?

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.718
Hey.

01:29:15.343 --> 01:29:16.343
We're done here.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.871
Fixed the closet door, too.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.510
And if you'd like, I could take a look
at the washing machine.

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.931
No, I couldn't ask you to do that.

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:24.413
It's a disaster down there.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.052
Come on. How bad can it be?

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.429
Bloody hell.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.238
Everything still quiet in there?

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.830
Yes. Thank goodness. Yes.

01:29:34.854 --> 01:29:35.854
Yes.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.191
It would be something though, wouldn't it?

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:42.954
If we were able to prove beyond a
shadow of a doubt that there is a life,

01:29:43.079 --> 01:29:44.276
beyond this?

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.634
It would be historic.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.879
Is that why you're doing this?

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.905
Because you want to be a part
of something historic?

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.870
This isn't a laboratory,
this is someone's house.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.077
And I think helping that family
is the only thing that matters.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.117
No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:07.098
My daughter died in a car
crash several years ago.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:11.899
Afterwards, I started to experience things.

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:14.658
I think she wanted to communicate with me.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.913
And, yes, it would help
if I knew that she was...

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.014
I don't know.

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.999
Somewhere.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.513
That's not it.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.314
Oh, great.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.128
Think I found it.

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.153
All right.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.794
It's right here.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.752
Come and get it. Margaret!

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.473
Johnny, come and get it.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.556
Ok.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.229
Think I got it.

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.520
All right.

01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.314
There we go.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.094
What's that?

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:47.152
Ed? There's...
There's something behind you.

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.355
What is it?

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.832
Oh, Jesus!

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:11.840
Peggy!

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.235
Peggy!

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.353
He grabbed me.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.434
It was him.

01:33:17.659 --> 01:33:19.212
He tried to pull me under.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.151
Oh, my God! Look!

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.242
Oh God, you're scratched.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.750
That's not a scratch, that's a bite mark.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:29.035
He bit me. Just like he did Janet.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.391
Hey, Janet, can you get me another one?

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.600
Yeah.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.440
Janet?

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.593
What's wrong?

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.112
Don't you see it?

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.314
See what?

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.273
In the kitchen.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.958
Tell me what you see.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.680
It's playing with the knives,

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.108
hiding in the dark.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.958
Johnny! Johnny, what you doing?

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.513
Johnny, no!

01:35:33.738 --> 01:35:35.420
Johnny, don't go!

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.353
Remember what Mr. Warren said?

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.238
We can't let it bully us.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.117
This is our house.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.028
Johnny.

01:35:44.353 --> 01:35:46.177
Johnny, please come back.

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.319
What's the matter? What's happened?

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.358
Janet's gone!
She was just right here!

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.560
Come on.

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.080
No!

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.191
Mum!
Johnny!

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.198
Ed? What's going on?

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.480
Mum.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.194
Mum, Johnny's in there!

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:33.839
No!

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.200
Johnny!

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.199
Johnny!

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:39.880
Step back.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.560
Come on.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.796
Where are they?

01:36:53.221 --> 01:36:54.523
Where are they?

01:36:55.147 --> 01:36:56.147
Johnny?

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:57.520
Johnny?

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.394
Darling!

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.198
Oh, darling, come here.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.719
Are you all right?

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.959
It's all right, darling.

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.508
It's all right.

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:17.989
Where's Janet?

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.154
Where's Janet?

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.548
Janet!

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.272
Guys, I'm picking up something in here.

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.560
Ed, watch the...

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.871
Me... Won't...

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.236
Me... Won't...

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.680
Me...

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:26.700
Janet.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.915
It's Ok. It's Ok.
Come on. Come on.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.639
Come on, now.

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.797
It's Ok. Watch out. Look out.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.472
Slowly!
Ok.

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:38.350
Darling, it's all right.

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.477
It's all right, Mum's here.
Mum's here, darling.

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.512
How did she get in there?

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.197
It's all right, darling. What's that?

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:02.869
It's fine.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:08.708
Can I...

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.389
What is it?

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:16.878
She's faking it.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.839
What?

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.872
I have proof.

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.832
So much for your leap of faith.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.355
What?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.753
My girl didn't make this up.
I've seen things.

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.792
She was caught red-handed faking an event.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.554
No, it's not possible.
Have you seen it in there?

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.354
How could a 12year old girl
throw a table across the room?

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.352
It's over. Do you understand?

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.997
For the sake of your daughter,
don't make this harder than it already is.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.596
She couldn't have pulled this off alone.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:34.959
Oh, how dare you.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.982
What, you think I put her up to this?

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.396
What about the police?
Are they in on this, too?

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.755
No, it's all right.

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:42.393
What about you two?

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.438
You believe us, don't you?

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.833
We wanna help.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:55.327
But the Church will take one look at
that video and that'll be the end of it.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.490
They'll wanna distance themselves from
anything that remotely resembles a hoax.

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.676
I'd like you to leave, please.

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.872
Now, go on, get out.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.312
Get out, the lot of you!

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.429
Get out!

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.832
Perhaps, you could somehow
reach out to the spirit.

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.470
You know, make contact with it yourself.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.516
I can't. Believe me, I've tried.

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.196
I'm sorry, I'm just not
sensing anything here.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.635
So, that's it, then?

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.505
You hold out a lifeline to them
and then you just throw it away?

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.471
We don't like this any more than you do.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.802
We'll tell the Church
about everything we've seen.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.639
But, the only piece of
concrete evidence we've got,

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.265
is a video of Janet faking an incident.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.035
Yeah, but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.400
You might want this.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.717
And, just because she faked it this once,
doesn't change the fact that...

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.124
No, it changes everything.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.959
We're agents of the Church here.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.275
They'd be calling us home
even if Peggy hadn't asked us to leave.

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.915
You've done really
good work here, Maurice.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.191
You were here for them
when no one else was.

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.417
Thank you.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.872
But, sometimes you need
to make a leap of faith.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:29.240
Believe when nobody else will.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.392
This doesn't feel right.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:10.800
I know.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.600
Have a safe trip.

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.472
Did you really do it?

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.757
Wreck the kitchen and all that?

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.878
But, why?

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.628
It said it would kill you,

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.433
if I didn't make them leave.

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.310
Don't you think it's a little convenient

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.150
that she just happened to fake an incident

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:18.238
in the one room of the house
that had a video camera pointing at it?

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.480
Yeah.

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.549
No.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:24.949
Oh, damn it.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.669
Lorraine.

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.060
Help me set up these tape recorders.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.952
Thread it through
and start it from the top.

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:04.760
All right.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.617
Remember those strange,
garbled messages we got from Janet?

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:10.439
You know, from Bill?
Yes.

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:11.954
There were two of them, right?

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:13.429
Here's the first one.

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.550
Help! It...

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.869
Let go!

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:24.198
Help! It... Let...

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.475
Go!

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:30.950
We thought he was referring 
to himself, right?

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.395
Yes.
Listen to the second one.

01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.993
Me... Won't...

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.431
Me... Won't...

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.995
Me...

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.432
If I'm right about this...

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.796
Help me! It won't let me go!

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.278
Help me! It won't let me go!

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.996
I come here to see my family.

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:55.830
But they're not here now.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.993
I think,

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.232
I'd like to go now.

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:07.075
But I can't.
Why not?

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.077
It wants her. So badly.

01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:13.677
It almost has her.

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:15.753
Tell me how to stop it.

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:23.308
I'm given and I'm taken.

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:26.154
I was there at your first breath.

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.213
You didn't ask for me.

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:33.079
But I'll follow you till death.

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.110
Wait. I don't understand.

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.440
Please...

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.360
Oh, God!

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:43.755
You're bleeding!

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.719
What is happening?

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:55.909
The old man's spirit is just a pawn.

01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:59.238
He's been enslaved
to where he's to weaken Janet's will.

01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:00.708
Enslaved? Enslaved by who?

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.194
Something inhuman.

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.398
Something that's taken
a blasphemous form to attack my faith.

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.990
There is a demonic presence in that house.

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.849
You need to get Vic before he leaves.
We need to go back.

01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:12.920
Ok.

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.875
Mom, help me, please! Mom!

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:38.674
Please, Mom, help me! Help!

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.279
For God's sake, leave us alone!

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.469
Margaret!

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.512
Margaret, no!

01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:58.474
Come on, let's get out of here!

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.308
Come on, let's get out!

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.110
Go to Peggy's house!
What, you're not coming?

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.509
I can't leave Janet!

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.036
No! Janet!
Mum!

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.080
Janet!

01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.630
Well, I don't understand it.

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.059
I mean, first you say it's not real, now it is.

01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:20.210
Her sight was being blocked
by the inhuman spirit.

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.594
The old man's spirit

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.189
couldn't break through
until we left that house.

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:27.397
Everything they've experienced
has been a manifestation of the demonic.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.550
The Old Man, the Crooked Man,
they're just a facade,

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.470
trying to keep us from seeing
the real evil in that house.

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.830
In my vision, he wanted to help me,
but he was too afraid.

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:36.070
And he kept speaking in a kind of riddle.

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.480
Something like, I am given and I am taken.

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.478
I was there at your first breath.

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.313
You didn't ask for me.

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:51.194
But I will follow you until your death.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.110
Your name. You didn't ask for it.
It was given, when you were born.

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.590
That's it! Knowing the demon's name

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:02.555
gives us power over it
and we can cast it out.

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.671
Yeah, sure, but we don't know its name.

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:05.955
But, maybe we do.

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:09.212
Why else would he give us that clue?

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.237
He must think that we know it somehow.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.073
So, what do you do now?

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.719
An inhuman spirit powerful
enough to cloud Lorraine's sight

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.887
is more than a match for me.

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.070
We need to get Janet to the Church
before it kills her.

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.914
Janet!

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:25.709
What happened?

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.200
Janet!

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.835
Janet!

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:38.195
Thank God you're here.

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.919
Janet's in there!
Come on!

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760
Damn it.

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.836
Ed! Are you Ok?
Yeah!

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.429
I'm gonna go around back!

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.392
No! Ed! No!

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.309
Ed, no, no, no.

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.233
I'm gonna come with you!

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:21.954
Peggy, stay here.
Janet!

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:24.470
Wait in the car with the kids! Wait!
Janet!

01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.680
Janet!

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:29.560
Get in the car.

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:32.314
Go in, go on. You, too, Peggy. Come on!

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:39.920
Ed?

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.480
Ed?

01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:53.760
Ed?

01:51:53.784 --> 01:51:55.076
No. No!

01:51:55.901 --> 01:51:56.901
Come on!

01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.195
Ed!

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.959
It won't open!

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:04.714
Let me try.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.470
We need to break it down!
All right.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:09.788
Wait here.
Break it!

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.678
Ed, hon, wait right there.

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.354
Wait. Vic will be right back.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.630
I can't wait. I'm going on ahead.

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.757
No, Ed, don't! Stop!

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:20.513
You can't fight this alone.

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:24.913
She needs our help!

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.836
Ed, please. Please, just wait for me.

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.953
Please wait for me.

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:40.205
I can't lose you.

01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:42.941
I am so scared.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.115
I know.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:49.949
Me, too.

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:52.312
But I have to help her.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.752
But, what about my vision?

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.229
I know I made a promise to you, hon,

01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:04.032
but I have to do this.

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:08.039
I love you, Lorraine.

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.960
Ed, no!

01:53:10.385 --> 01:53:11.298
No!

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.039
Stop! Don't!

01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:16.318
Ed!

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.793
No!

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:23.034
No. Stop.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.920
Ed! Someone! Help!

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:38.920
Move.

01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.155
Oh, God.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.758
Janet, where are you?

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.389
Come on!

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.595
Help!

01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:25.349
Janet!

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.760
Janet!

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:28.115
Help me!

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:29.549
Janet!

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:39.357
In the name of the Father and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:03.355
What's your name?

01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:05.280
What's your...

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:08.270
What's your name?

01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.479
I do know your name.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.115
I asked you.

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:23.759
Tell me who you are!

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:25.114
And you told me.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.558
You told me your name.

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.629
And I wrote it down.

01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:38.880
I need my Bible!

01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.348
Why? What's happening?

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:41.840
What...

01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.707
The demon's name gives us power over it.

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.120
V.

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:03.276
A. L.

01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:05.278
A. K.

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.229
Valak.

01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:37.114
Janet!

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.748
Janet?

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.671
<i>There was a crooked man</i>

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.559
<i>And he walked a crooked mile</i>

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:09.234
<i>He found a crooked sixpence
upon a crooked stile</i>

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:14.708
<i>He bought a crooked cat
which caught a crooked mouse</i>

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:19.233
<i>And they all lived together in a little...</i>

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.514
Vic! Vic! Let me through.

01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:50.842
No, wait, Lorraine, let me try.
I'm going! No!

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.619
Let me go in. Lorraine!

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:53.800
Ed!

01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:55.480
Lorraine!

01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.588
Lorraine!

02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:05.120
Ed!

02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:19.120
Janet?

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:43.632
Janet! No! No!

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.200
I got you.

02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.396
Come on.

02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:53.755
No!

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.433
Janet.

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:56.680
Ed!

02:00:57.304 --> 02:00:58.304
Ed!

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:06.195
Ed!

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:14.269
Lorraine!

02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:32.195
Ed!

02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:39.194
Your name gives me dominion
over you, demon.

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:41.352
And I do know your name!

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.592
You are Valak!

02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:47.553
The defiler.

02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:51.350
The profane, the marquis of snakes!

02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:56.199
In the name of the Father
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:59.393
I condemn you back to hell!

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:13.160
No!

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Ed!

02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:18.960
Come on!

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:20.560
Ed!

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.479
Ok. We're good. Ok.

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.294
Ed, are you Ok?
No, check on her.

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:30.435
Janet?

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.177
Oh, my God! Is she all right?

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:34.599
I'll call an ambulance.

02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:37.320
Janet, sit up, darling. Sit up.

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:38.909
Here you go now.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.919
Take a big, deep breath.

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:43.435
Big, deep breath. There you go.

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.298
You all right?

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:24.233
He'll be fine.

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.991
Does she look all right?
Yeah, she's fine.

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.358
You saved her.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:42.480
No.

02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:44.988
You saved us.

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:49.310
Didn't I tell you it was meant to be?

02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:53.757
But you believed in me.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.989
I couldn't have done it without you.

02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:12.590
Thanks for coming back for us.

02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.470
Here, sit down. Sit down.

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:27.029
You know...

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:33.031
This has kept me safe since I was a kid.

02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:36.193
I want you to have it.

02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:43.199
And, when you grow up,

02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:46.992
you find someone who needs it,
you give it to them.

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.708
Deal?

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.992
I'm so lucky.

02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:02.871
You said one person
could change everything.

02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:04.960
But...

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.592
I've got two.

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:19.275
Ok.

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:52.639
<i>Tell me about the beginning, the
first night of your happening.</i>

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:54.830
<i>What was your brother doing?
Brothers playing</i>

02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:55.920
<i>and fooling about.</i>

02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:57.468
<i>I wasn't quite sure, no.</i>

02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:00.228
<i>They were scared?
Yeah, petrified.</i>

02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:01.600
<i>Janet? What about Janet?</i>

02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:06.596
<i>When it comes from your area, Janet,
do you feel anything in your throat?</i>

02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.757
<i>No.
You just don't feel anything?</i>

02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:10.559
<i>Now, I'm looking at Janet.</i>

02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:12.160
<i>Don't fight in here.</i>

02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:13.670
<i>And the voice comes from her,</i>

02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:15.470
<i>but her mouth doesn't move
and nothing moves.</i>

02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:16.560
<i>Turn it off!</i>

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:17.989
<i>I know...</i>

02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:20.999
<i>Janet, can you tell when
the voice is gonna come through you?</i>

02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:23.191
<i>No. No, I don't ever.</i>

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:25.230
<i>You know who I am?
Do you know what my name is?</i>

02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:27.356
<i>Yeah. Ed. Ed!</i>

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:33.871
<i>Were you a Christian?</i>

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:36.356
<i>No! You know it!</i>

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:38.400
<i>What year did you die?
Do you remember?</i>

02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:41.791
<i>Yeah. I'm dead. Sixty-one.</i>

02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:44.113
<i>Nineteen sixty-one.</i>
