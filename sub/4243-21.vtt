WEBVTT

00:00.725 --> 00:02.969
Hey, Mr. Shue, it's Rachel,
how are you?

00:03.020 --> 00:04.186
Rachel, hey, good.

00:04.221 --> 00:06.471
Yeah, just, uh, getting ready
for regionals.

00:06.523 --> 00:08.140
Well, I wanted you to be
the first that I told...

00:08.191 --> 00:10.643
even before Kurt, before
my dads, or even before Finn...

00:10.677 --> 00:13.312
that I had my callback
for <i>Funny Girl</i> this morning.

00:13.363 --> 00:14.614
Wait, did you get Fanny Brice?

00:14.648 --> 00:15.681
Not yet, but it's between me

00:15.716 --> 00:17.316
and two other girls.

00:17.367 --> 00:18.868
Oh, that is
incredible news, Rachel.

00:18.902 --> 00:20.119
Y-You're a shoo-in.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.738
Aw, I just want you to know
that if it does happen,

00:22.772 --> 00:23.956
it's because of you.

00:23.991 --> 00:26.325
Well, if, if I contributed
even a little bit...

00:26.376 --> 00:28.294
Well, you contributed
more than a little.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.080
I sang "Don't Stop Believin'"
for my audition,

00:31.114 --> 00:33.966
and when I sang it,
I thought about that first week

00:34.001 --> 00:35.751
that we were all in Glee Club

00:35.785 --> 00:37.553
and how amazing
we all were together,

00:37.588 --> 00:39.655
and it just brought back
so many emotions,

00:39.690 --> 00:42.341
it made my performance
so powerful,

00:42.392 --> 00:45.011
and, well, you were the one that
put that all together, so...

00:46.063 --> 00:47.980
You okay, Mr. Shue?

00:48.015 --> 00:49.815
Yeah, fine, just allergies.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.822
Rachel... I'm so proud of you.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.908
Y-You're one of our biggest
success stories,

00:58.942 --> 01:01.327
a-and no matter what happens
with <i>Funny Girl,</i>

01:01.361 --> 01:03.663
I mean, you're in New York,
you're living your dream.

01:03.697 --> 01:04.914
Not many people can say that.

01:04.947 --> 01:06.165
I know,

01:06.199 --> 01:10.369
it's a special
and wonderful thing, so...

01:10.420 --> 01:11.837
And when I'm at Radio City

01:11.872 --> 01:14.840
and I'm accepting my Tony Award
and I forget to thank you, well,

01:14.875 --> 01:16.342
thank you.

01:16.376 --> 01:17.510
Thank you.

01:21.598 --> 01:23.549
Wonderful.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.520
All right, guys, I just got
some wonderful news from Rachel.

01:27.554 --> 01:29.689
She's got a second callback
for <i>Funny Girl.</i>

01:32.059 --> 01:34.193
And that's not
our only good news.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.062
Brittany is at M.I.T.
touring the campus

01:36.113 --> 01:38.230
because she's got
an early acceptance.

01:38.281 --> 01:39.231
That can't be true.

01:39.282 --> 01:41.784
And I re-proposed
to Emma.

01:41.818 --> 01:44.370
She reaccepted, and we're
getting married after regionals.

01:44.404 --> 01:45.788
Yay!
We're excited.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.541
I've got good news, too.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.743
I'm wait-listed at the Columbus
College of Veterinary Medicine.

01:50.794 --> 01:52.461
It's a fallback
if I don't pursue acting.

01:52.496 --> 01:53.546
Bless her heart.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.214
Tina, that's
not just good news.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.916
It's wonderful,

01:56.967 --> 01:58.751
and that's what this
week is all about.

01:58.802 --> 02:01.003
We're taking a lesson from one
of the greatest musical artists

02:01.037 --> 02:02.221
of all time.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.473
Despite facing a ton of
obstacles,

02:04.508 --> 02:06.425
he's a living example
of embracing...

02:06.476 --> 02:09.895
n-n-no, <i>celebrating...</i>
joy and optimism,

02:09.930 --> 02:12.314
and he's collected
25 Grammys along the way.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.233
So don't you worry 'bout a thing

02:14.267 --> 02:16.102
because whether you're
ebony or ivory,

02:16.153 --> 02:18.437
you are the sunshine of my life.

02:18.488 --> 02:20.239
Yes. And next week at
regionals we will be

02:20.273 --> 02:22.241
jammin' on higher ground.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.826
Yay!

02:23.860 --> 02:26.245
Yeah-yeah,
it's a Stevie Wonder week.

02:28.992 --> 02:31.386

02:32.019 --> 02:33.969
Hey, Crippy
Longstocking, wait up.

02:34.003 --> 02:35.354
You know what?
That's offensive.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.355
Aw, boo hoo.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.473
I have a disability, too.

02:37.507 --> 02:38.507
My disability is
that I can't tell

02:38.525 --> 02:39.642
when something's offensive,

02:39.676 --> 02:41.510
and for you to point
that out is bullying.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.512
Care to share why
you're so depressed?

02:43.530 --> 02:45.031
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.065
Nice try, liar.

02:46.116 --> 02:47.533
You're depressed
and I know why.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.535
When the girls were performing
during Guilty Pleasures Week,

02:49.569 --> 02:51.821
you used those googly,
thyroid-conditioned eyeballs

02:51.855 --> 02:55.157
of yours and ogled me like I
was a Taiwanese streetwalker.

02:55.191 --> 02:56.492
Well, I regret to inform you

02:56.526 --> 02:59.161
that you will never be
climbing all up on this.

02:59.195 --> 03:00.713
Actually that's not
what I was upset about,

03:00.747 --> 03:02.248
but thank you for giving me
something else

03:02.299 --> 03:04.032
to make me depressed.
Aha!

03:04.051 --> 03:05.868
I knew you were depressed
about something.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.753
Yesterday when I got home,

03:07.804 --> 03:09.388
there was an envelope
waiting for me,

03:09.423 --> 03:11.340
and inside was the news
that I got accepted

03:11.374 --> 03:12.842
into the Brooklyn Film Academy.

03:12.876 --> 03:13.876
Wait, are you serious?

03:13.910 --> 03:14.927
Yes, actually I am.

03:14.978 --> 03:16.712
But you know what?
I'm not going.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.847
Why?

03:17.881 --> 03:19.515
Believe it or not,
I don't want to talk about it,

03:19.549 --> 03:21.767
and I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone.

perfect Stevie song

06:49.993 --> 06:53.228
to celebrate Artie getting his
acceptance letter into film school.

06:53.263 --> 06:55.397
Yeah, bring it.

06:55.432 --> 06:56.398
Signed, sealed, delivered.

06:56.433 --> 06:57.733
That's right.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.635
Well, you know, that may have
been the perfect song,

06:59.669 --> 07:01.070
but that performance
was just one package

07:01.104 --> 07:02.571
that I'm not signing for.

07:02.605 --> 07:04.740
I mean, honestly, it was good,
but you guys have got

07:04.774 --> 07:06.742
to be great for regionals.

07:06.776 --> 07:08.410
Yeah, clearly we should be
taking our advice

07:08.445 --> 07:10.446
from someone
who came crawling back to Ohio

07:10.480 --> 07:12.948
after apparently having
her L.A. dream shattered.

07:12.983 --> 07:14.416
You learn your new lyrics yet?

07:14.451 --> 07:17.586
♪ Do you want fries with that?

07:17.620 --> 07:19.088
Oh, well, maybe
if you put some

07:19.122 --> 07:20.422
of that sass
in your performance,

07:20.457 --> 07:22.124
your teacher wouldn't have
begged me to come here

07:22.158 --> 07:23.492
and be your new vocal coach.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.327
Mercedes is one
of the strongest vocalists

07:25.362 --> 07:26.662
in McKinley Glee Club history.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.930
So get on point, Kitty,

07:27.964 --> 07:29.665
your little theory about
Mercedes' shattered dreams,

07:29.699 --> 07:31.700
like most of the garbage
that comes out of your mouth,

07:31.735 --> 07:32.801
is wrong.

07:32.836 --> 07:34.269
All right, Mercedes is
back because she has

07:34.304 --> 07:35.804
a new album coming out,
all about home,

07:35.839 --> 07:37.506
and she's come back
to film a video for it.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.974
Wow, Mercedes, that's awesome.

07:39.009 --> 07:41.343
And Mr. Shue asked me to help
choreograph for regionals.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.012
I love you, Mike,
I love all my exes.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.780
But this isn't wonderful
news, it's shocking.

07:44.814 --> 07:47.149
Now we need some guy
to help us dance?

07:47.183 --> 07:48.784
Hashtag Glee Hates Girls.

07:48.818 --> 07:50.352
And what are you here to
lecture us about, Kurt,

07:50.387 --> 07:52.121
our horrible taste in clothing?

07:52.155 --> 07:54.623
My dad has cancer.

07:54.657 --> 07:56.625
Thanks, Tina.

07:56.659 --> 07:59.628
All right, let's take
this whole thing from the top.

07:59.662 --> 08:02.798
Kitty in the back. Marley,
I want you on lead vocals.

08:02.832 --> 08:04.333
All right, come on...
let's go.

08:04.367 --> 08:05.968
Artie. I told you not
to say anything.

08:06.002 --> 08:08.037
Come on, Artie, I just
gave you a big shout-out

08:08.071 --> 08:10.072
in the choir room because you
have a lot to be proud of.

08:10.106 --> 08:11.907
I'm not going, so I have
nothing to be proud of, Kitty.

08:11.941 --> 08:13.175
Thank you
for the effort, though.

08:13.209 --> 08:15.177
Isn't a big film school like
your dream or something?

08:15.211 --> 08:16.478
Tap the brakes, buddy.

08:16.513 --> 08:18.814
My mom is freaking out.

08:18.848 --> 08:20.649
She's taken care of me
my whole life, and it's

08:20.683 --> 08:22.818
scary for her to think of me
in the big city all alone.

08:22.852 --> 08:24.519
New York isn't exactly
wheel-friendly

08:24.537 --> 08:25.654
unless you're a bike messenger.

08:25.688 --> 08:27.656
And why are you being so nice?
Why do you even care?

08:27.690 --> 08:29.191
Duh, I'm trying to be wonderful.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.876
I like to switch it
up, be unpredictable.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.878
Sometimes I'm sweet,
sometimes I'm sour.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.163
Keeps it interesting.

08:34.197 --> 08:37.166
Besides, I know how important
you are to your mom,

08:37.200 --> 08:40.335
but you'd be amazing
in film school.

08:40.369 --> 08:43.038
Just think about it.

08:47.577 --> 08:49.828
All this marriage equality news
is so exciting.

08:49.879 --> 08:50.996
New York.

08:51.047 --> 08:52.247
It's just... it's
gonna be insane.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.332
Isabelle's already consulting

08:53.383 --> 08:54.616
on like, seven
different gay weddings.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.784
It's historic, and soon

08:55.802 --> 08:57.719
I'm going to be
in New York to see it.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.421
By the way, you
look cute today.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.124
And I mean like,
like, dirty-cute.

09:04.094 --> 09:06.228
The album is
called <i>Hell 2 The No,</i>

09:06.262 --> 09:07.729
based off of the
soon-to-be hit single.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.014
I love it.

09:09.065 --> 09:11.266
But for the music video, Mike,

09:11.300 --> 09:12.851
you know, it's
got to be bumping,

09:12.902 --> 09:14.853
and fast and furious,
but also soulful

09:14.904 --> 09:16.355
and smooth, but like "smoov,"

09:16.406 --> 09:18.107
you know, like
smooth with a "V."

09:18.141 --> 09:19.108
And I want <i>eleganza,</i>

09:19.142 --> 09:21.276
I want club kid sickness,

09:21.310 --> 09:22.611
I want fresh, fresh, fresh.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.979
It's got to pop.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.697
You are so L.A. right now
it's breathless.

09:25.748 --> 09:27.449
Mike knows what I'm
talking about, right?

09:27.483 --> 09:29.168
Oh, I totally know
what you mean.

09:30.253 --> 09:31.787
Don't worry.
I'm all over it.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.205
With what I've learned
at the Joffrey,

09:33.256 --> 09:36.041
I've got new moves so hot
you're gonna want to say.

09:36.092 --> 09:37.376
"Hell to the yes."

09:37.427 --> 09:39.211
Yeah, don't change the brand.
No.

09:39.262 --> 09:41.597
I'm so glad you guys are back
here just before regionals.

09:41.631 --> 09:42.881
We really need you around.

09:42.932 --> 09:44.599
You're gonna nail it, no sweat.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.485
All right, so what's
ing on between you two?

09:46.536 --> 09:48.770
Because it was pretty
boy-on-boy heavy

09:48.788 --> 09:50.289
at the wedding.
We're not together.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.907
Um, but it's cool.

09:51.941 --> 09:53.242
Why did I hear that Tina

09:53.276 --> 09:55.744
did something to you
called the vapo...

09:55.778 --> 09:57.445
Okay, dude, is that
really important right now?

09:57.464 --> 09:58.780
This doesn't matter.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.583
Kurt, your dad
is gonna be fine.

10:01.617 --> 10:04.086
Everything is gonna be okay.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.087
We're here.

10:05.121 --> 10:06.421
Trust.

10:06.455 --> 10:08.957
Wow.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.146
Well, Blaine's right,
thank God you guys are here

10:14.180 --> 10:15.731
because we both need you
right now.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.439
I don't know, Bernard.

10:24.473 --> 10:25.657
Sure smells like someone's

10:25.692 --> 10:27.659
getting ready for
a second <i>Funny Girl</i> callback.

10:27.694 --> 10:28.827
Who told you guys about that?

10:28.862 --> 10:30.496
We also know who
your competish is,

10:30.530 --> 10:32.781
and bitches be formidable.

10:32.815 --> 10:33.999
The latest postings

10:34.033 --> 10:36.651
on BroadwayWorld.com have you
neck and neck

10:36.669 --> 10:38.787
with two-time Tony winner
Sutton Foster.

10:38.821 --> 10:40.172
No, that's impossible.
First of all,

10:40.206 --> 10:41.656
she's on <i>Bunheads,</i>
and she has the wrong nose.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.175
This would be
during her hiatus,

10:43.209 --> 10:44.626
and word around Shubert Alley

10:44.660 --> 10:45.794
is she's looking
into prosthetics,

10:45.828 --> 10:47.162
as is Miss Mamie Gummer,

10:47.180 --> 10:48.797
daughter
of the legendary legend,

10:48.831 --> 10:50.349
Meryl Streep.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.683
What? Can she even sing?

10:51.718 --> 10:53.168
Point is, you better
bring your A game,

10:53.186 --> 10:54.186
and you better

10:54.220 --> 10:55.854
hope no one tells Cassandra

10:55.889 --> 10:57.639
about your extracurricular
activities.

10:57.673 --> 10:59.174
Why? NYADA's students
are allowed

10:59.192 --> 11:00.526
to explore outside
acting opportunities.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.643
Technically,

11:01.677 --> 11:03.011
but you need a teacher
to sign of.

11:03.029 --> 11:04.512
And Cassie July's been
looking for a reason

11:04.531 --> 11:06.481
to destroy and expel you
since day one.

11:06.515 --> 11:07.849
So from where we're standing,

11:07.867 --> 11:09.568
you're not just risking
humiliation at the hands

11:09.619 --> 11:11.703
of one of the Streep girls
by going after Fanny...

11:11.738 --> 11:13.521
You're also risking
the Greek-like wrath

11:13.540 --> 11:14.689
of Cassandra July.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.875
But don't worry,
we sincerely doubt

11:16.910 --> 11:18.693
Cassie July's trolling
the Broadway chat rooms,

11:18.711 --> 11:21.029
keeping tabs
on her most hated student.

11:27.870 --> 11:31.173
Just confirmed, Rachel Berry
is a finalist for Fanny Brice.

11:31.207 --> 11:32.174
We thought you'd want to know

11:32.208 --> 11:33.559
and pray this wins
us your favor.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.577
Mm.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.072
Alright everybody,

11:39.108 --> 11:41.259
let's give it up for Island Beetz
recording artist extraordinaire,

11:41.293 --> 11:43.628
Mercedes Jones.

11:47.850 --> 11:49.601
All right, all right.
Now, I know that Kurt

11:49.635 --> 11:50.969
is going through a lot
this week,

11:50.987 --> 11:52.103
but in spite of that,

11:52.137 --> 11:54.272
we are all very happy
to be here.

11:54.306 --> 11:57.108
As you may remember,
we saw you guys at sectionals,

11:57.142 --> 11:58.443
and there's a reason
that you guys lost.

11:58.477 --> 12:00.161
Fear.

12:00.196 --> 12:01.780
For instance, Marley.

12:01.814 --> 12:04.165
You have got killer vocals,

12:04.200 --> 12:06.167
homegirl, so why is it

12:06.202 --> 12:08.787
that I've never heard you do a
Mercedes Jones-style vocal run?

12:08.821 --> 12:11.289
I don't know. I-I guess
I've just been scared to try.

12:11.323 --> 12:13.708
Exactly. You're scared
to belt it out.

12:13.759 --> 12:15.126
And you're probably afraid

12:15.160 --> 12:18.630
that when you do, I'm gonna test
your breath control

12:18.664 --> 12:22.133
by hitting you in the
solar plexus with this maraca.

12:22.167 --> 12:24.803
All right, give this girl a note
to do a little runnin' with.

12:26.505 --> 12:30.191
♪ Oh...

12:32.678 --> 12:35.313
See? If you had
better breath control,

12:35.347 --> 12:38.316
you could probably hold
that note every time.

12:38.350 --> 12:39.985
All right, floppy-headed
bass player,

12:40.019 --> 12:42.487
why don't you give us a little
bit of that spooky Stevie Wonder

12:42.521 --> 12:43.989
bass line to get us moving.

12:44.023 --> 12:46.992
And all of y'all need
to shake out your nerves

12:47.026 --> 12:49.494
and stop being so scared,
and that includes you, Kurt.

12:49.528 --> 12:51.379
I know what you're going
through, and this one's

12:51.414 --> 12:52.380
for you, baby. And, Marley,

12:52.415 --> 12:53.999
I want to hear
those high notes,

12:54.033 --> 12:56.167
and don't be stingy

Hey.
Hold up.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.529
Take a big, deep breath

15:04.563 --> 15:06.281
and remember this moment,
Little Puckerman,

15:06.332 --> 15:09.117
because your life
is about to change forever.

15:09.168 --> 15:11.953
Mercedes wants you and me
to be her featured dancers.

15:12.004 --> 15:13.004
You're a triple threat, dude...

15:13.038 --> 15:14.005
you're an amazing singer,

15:14.039 --> 15:15.173
you've got sick dance moves...

15:15.207 --> 15:16.708
And you're sexy as hell.

15:16.742 --> 15:18.009
We think

15:18.043 --> 15:19.344
you're Glee Club's
secret weapon.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.462
You've got to start
being a leader.

15:20.513 --> 15:21.513
I'm just a sophomore.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.631
No. You're gonna twiddle
your sexy thumbs

15:23.682 --> 15:26.684
waiting for some upperclassman
to order you around?

15:26.719 --> 15:28.303
Hell to the no.

15:28.354 --> 15:29.804
You know, Jesus wrote
in the Bible

15:29.855 --> 15:32.474
somewhere, "Do not hide
your light under a bushel."

15:32.525 --> 15:34.192
You've got to let it shine!

15:34.226 --> 15:36.694
Are you gonna argue
with our Lord and Savior Jesus?

15:36.729 --> 15:38.530
I mean, I'm Jewish.
So was he.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.865
You're gonna be in my music
video, and you're gonna start

15:40.900 --> 15:42.650
taking your God-given talent
seriously

15:42.701 --> 15:45.653
because, baby,
you're a damn superstar.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.492
How long have we been waiting?

15:50.543 --> 15:53.828
I don't know.
Like... 15 minutes.

15:53.879 --> 15:55.213
After a half hour
in the waiting room?

15:56.582 --> 15:58.216
Please tell me that is not

15:58.250 --> 16:00.084
a dark blue T-shirt
under your flannel.

16:00.118 --> 16:02.003
All right, I asked you
not to wear dark colors.

16:02.054 --> 16:03.888
Okay, dark blue
is close to black,

16:03.923 --> 16:05.340
and we all know
what black means.

16:05.391 --> 16:07.425
I don't think my wardrobe
is gonna have any impact

16:07.459 --> 16:08.676
on what the results are.

16:08.727 --> 16:09.677
But you don't know
for sure, okay?

16:09.728 --> 16:11.563
I mean, I asked you
to do one thing.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.565
I am barely keeping it
together, Kurt!

16:13.599 --> 16:16.267
Can you just knock it off please
and sit down?

16:18.938 --> 16:20.772
Hey, Doc,

16:20.806 --> 16:22.106
what's the good word?
You know,

16:22.140 --> 16:23.691
I'm gonna skip the cliches
about my golf game

16:23.742 --> 16:26.611
and get right to it.
As you know, we were

16:26.645 --> 16:28.279
mildly aggressive
with your treatment

16:28.313 --> 16:29.914
considering you were still
in stage I.

16:29.949 --> 16:32.283
We used implant
radiation therapy.

16:32.317 --> 16:34.035
And he completely
changed his diet.

16:34.086 --> 16:35.453
Well, whatever you were doing,
it worked.

16:35.487 --> 16:37.455
The tumor's gone.
What?

16:37.489 --> 16:40.291
Your PSA levels are back to
normal, and you have the prostate

16:40.325 --> 16:42.377
of a 20-year-old according
to your Gleason scores.

16:42.428 --> 16:43.711
Okay, wait, s-so...

16:43.762 --> 16:45.129
you're saying he's cured?

16:45.163 --> 16:48.633
We prefer "in remission"
but in layman's terms, yeah.

16:49.668 --> 16:51.719
Hey! Hey!

16:51.770 --> 16:53.888
Looks like I picked
the right shirt, huh, buddy?

16:53.939 --> 16:55.557
Come on, man! Oh!

16:56.976 --> 16:59.777
Doc, thank you so much.
Thank you.

16:59.812 --> 17:00.895
Take a moment.

17:00.946 --> 17:02.730
Oh, my God.

17:02.781 --> 17:04.781
I just... I wasn't ready
to leave you guys yet.

17:06.151 --> 17:08.486
Things aren't finished, right?

17:08.520 --> 17:09.570
So much to do.

17:09.622 --> 17:11.990
You getting married,

17:12.023 --> 17:13.324
grandbabies,

17:13.358 --> 17:15.292
having old people sex
with Carole.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.961
Ugh.  I'm just so happy.

17:16.996 --> 17:19.964
I'm not going to miss it.

17:19.999 --> 17:21.499
I love you guys.

17:21.532 --> 17:23.417
Oh, I love you.
Love you.

17:23.469 --> 17:25.720
I don't have cancer.

17:31.256 --> 17:32.389
All right.

17:32.424 --> 17:33.457
He'll be here.

17:33.475 --> 17:35.259
Any minute, I'm sure. Yeah.

17:35.293 --> 17:36.593
Dad!
Hey.

17:36.627 --> 17:37.928
Hi, everybody.

17:41.149 --> 17:42.266
Good to see you.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.600
Shue. Good to see you, buddy.
Likewise.

17:43.634 --> 17:44.935
How you doing?
What's up, Blaine?

17:44.969 --> 17:46.603
Well, it's
probably not a surprise

17:46.637 --> 17:47.804
why I asked you
to come here today.

17:47.822 --> 17:50.107
I'm guessing it has
something to do with a song?

17:50.141 --> 17:51.641
Yes. But not just any song.

17:51.659 --> 17:53.477
See, the last time
I dedicated a song

17:53.495 --> 17:55.645
to you in this room,
you were in the hospital.

17:55.663 --> 17:58.248
But today we are celebrating
life's most treasured

17:58.283 --> 17:59.833
and wonderful gift...

17:59.868 --> 18:01.285
a second chance.

18:01.319 --> 18:02.753
See, when I was little,
you used to sing

18:02.787 --> 18:04.154
this song to me
in the car all the time

18:04.172 --> 18:06.290
and it always put
a smile on my face.

18:06.324 --> 18:08.509
So today it's my turn to sing,

18:08.543 --> 18:09.760
and your turn to smile.

18:09.794 --> 18:11.661
I'm already there, kiddo.

Thank you so much.

20:14.419 --> 20:17.387
...I've had a lot of experience,
honest!

20:17.422 --> 20:18.722
Why, I've been on the stage
since I was ten,

20:18.756 --> 20:19.956
amateur contests,

20:19.974 --> 20:21.475
Gottlieb's Southern
Repertory...

20:21.509 --> 20:23.894
Well, well, if it isn't
Little Miss David Schwimmer.

20:23.928 --> 20:26.396
I'm sorry, I thought
that I reserved this room.

20:26.431 --> 20:28.398
So you could stare at yourself
in the mirror

20:28.433 --> 20:31.768
and run lines for your
<i>Funny Girl</i> callback?

20:32.803 --> 20:34.571
You know this
isn't normal, right?

20:34.606 --> 20:36.573
Running lines in the mirror

20:36.608 --> 20:38.909
isn't a typical step
in the acting process.

20:38.943 --> 20:41.078
Actors less narcissistic
than yourself

20:41.112 --> 20:44.414
actually prefer to rehearse
with other actors.

20:44.449 --> 20:45.616
Who told you about my callback?

20:45.650 --> 20:48.652
Barbra Streisand,
a very close personal friend.

20:48.670 --> 20:50.253
See, I ran into her at Target,

20:50.288 --> 20:52.089
and then in passing
she just said

20:52.123 --> 20:54.091
that a NYADA freshman
who looked like a troll

20:54.125 --> 20:56.293
was slated to read
for producers on Wednesday.

20:56.327 --> 20:58.211
And then I thought to myself,

20:58.262 --> 20:59.829
"Babs can't be talking
about Schwimmer.

20:59.847 --> 21:02.633
Schwimmer has her dance
midterm that day."

21:02.667 --> 21:04.184
Please, Ms. July...
Mm-hmm?

21:04.218 --> 21:06.336
I cannot miss
this callback, okay?

21:06.354 --> 21:08.438
This is a once in
a lifetime opportunity...

21:08.473 --> 21:10.641
Right. I wouldn't dream
of you missing it.

21:10.675 --> 21:13.944
It's a once in a lifetime
opportunity for me, too.

21:13.978 --> 21:15.779
And I plan on attending
that callback.

21:15.813 --> 21:17.681
Because you have
a tendency to choke

21:17.699 --> 21:20.450
under pressure, and so
I'm going to be there...

21:20.485 --> 21:23.954
with Barbra and her husband,
James Brolin...

21:23.988 --> 21:27.124
to watch you blow your first
big Broadway audition.

21:27.158 --> 21:29.526
In the meantime, I'm gonna change
your midterm to tomorrow morning.

21:29.544 --> 21:30.794
What?
You heard me, David.

21:30.828 --> 21:34.131
6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning,
you will perform the solo

21:34.165 --> 21:36.133
of the second act of
Balanchine's

21:36.167 --> 21:38.535
1941 masterpiece
"Concerto Barocco,"

21:38.553 --> 21:40.003
which is widely regarded

21:40.037 --> 21:43.306
as the most difficult ballet
routine ever devised,

21:43.341 --> 21:45.208
while you're widely regarded

21:45.226 --> 21:47.477
as of having one of
the puffiest

21:47.512 --> 21:51.815
morning faces
of any known human.

21:51.849 --> 21:53.850
It's gonna be
a great combination.

22:01.743 --> 22:03.893
Since this week is
about wonderful things,

22:03.911 --> 22:05.996
I want to celebrate
a wonderful talent.

22:06.030 --> 22:08.498
He's new to Glee Club this year,
but I think if we all

22:08.533 --> 22:09.833
help him with his confidence,

22:09.867 --> 22:11.234
he can lead us
all the way to nationals.

22:14.038 --> 22:17.741

What?

24:50.261 --> 24:52.095
Oh, you can try that,

24:52.129 --> 24:53.680
but my uncle Julius
is an attorney

24:53.731 --> 24:54.848
and we will sue you

24:54.899 --> 24:56.149
right back.

24:56.183 --> 24:58.235
No, I don't need a night

25:03.190 --> 25:04.491
what just happened.

25:04.525 --> 25:07.577
Just my useless "producer."

25:07.612 --> 25:08.695
I thought you liked him.

25:08.746 --> 25:09.696
I did.

♪ Whoa-oh.

25:16.370 --> 25:17.871
I'd say let's have
another go, Mercedes,

25:17.922 --> 25:19.339
but honestly, your voice

25:19.373 --> 25:20.590
was perfection.

25:20.625 --> 25:22.292
So, let's move on
with "Lover on the DL"

25:22.326 --> 25:23.510
if we can, please.

25:23.544 --> 25:25.178

<i>shoot for my CD's cover art.</i>

25:27.765 --> 25:29.883
Could you just lean forward
a bit there, Mercedes?

25:31.102 --> 25:32.269
And drop that shoulder wrap.

25:32.303 --> 25:33.937
Look, I'm not
comfortable with that,

25:33.971 --> 25:35.004
Martin.

25:35.940 --> 25:36.890
You look like a girl

25:36.941 --> 25:38.058
going to church or the prom.

25:38.109 --> 25:39.192
Not like a girl

25:39.226 --> 25:41.111
who needs to move 100,000 units

25:41.145 --> 25:43.613
just to make a minor splash
in this marketplace.

25:43.648 --> 25:45.198
This is the look.

25:45.232 --> 25:46.900
This is what I'm wearing.

25:46.951 --> 25:48.068
All right.

25:49.153 --> 25:50.870
You heard the lady.

25:50.905 --> 25:52.205
She's the boss.

25:52.239 --> 25:53.657
Now they're saying my CD

25:53.691 --> 25:55.041
is off of their
release schedule

25:55.076 --> 25:57.377
until I agree to another photo shoot.

25:57.411 --> 25:59.212
One showing more skin.

25:59.246 --> 26:00.747
What? Screw him.

26:00.798 --> 26:02.132
Oh, and he said he'd be happy

26:02.166 --> 26:03.133
to use another girl's picture.

26:03.167 --> 26:04.217
On your CD?

26:04.251 --> 26:05.752
The one that you
are singing on?

26:05.803 --> 26:06.803
Oh, hell to the no.

26:06.837 --> 26:08.338
They don't want me.

26:08.372 --> 26:09.756
They just want my voice,

26:09.807 --> 26:10.890
not my whole person.

26:10.925 --> 26:12.559
You know, it's crazy, guys.

26:12.593 --> 26:13.727
I'm going to be

26:13.761 --> 26:17.013
dealing with this
the rest of my career.

26:17.047 --> 26:18.431
Everyone is gonna
want me to look

26:18.482 --> 26:20.817
like Beyoncé, and no one
is gonna be satisfied

26:20.851 --> 26:23.103
with me, Mercedes Jones.

26:23.154 --> 26:24.571
And they're crazy, and
you don't want to be

26:24.605 --> 26:25.939
in business with
people like that.

26:25.990 --> 26:27.941
You're not actually
considering it, are you?

26:27.992 --> 26:30.660
I've been working on
this album for a year.

26:30.695 --> 26:32.996
I need it to come out.

26:34.448 --> 26:36.166
Look, I'm sorry, guys.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.917
I don't what I'm gonna do,

26:37.952 --> 26:40.453
but I need to talk to my mom
about this hot mess.

26:51.072 --> 26:53.524
Mom, I'm home.

26:53.558 --> 26:54.758
Hi, Artie.

26:54.776 --> 26:56.560
Yeah, hey, Artie.

26:59.647 --> 27:02.116
Guess I beat you here,
and I guess I beat

27:02.150 --> 27:04.218
you to telling your
mom about your good news.

27:04.252 --> 27:07.454
Honey, why would you hide
something like that from me?

27:07.489 --> 27:09.289
So much for your lies.

27:09.324 --> 27:11.608
Your mom's completely
on board with you going

27:11.626 --> 27:13.410
to Brooklyn Film Academy,
by the way.

27:13.444 --> 27:15.245
I thought you were
a lot of things,

27:15.279 --> 27:17.114
but I didn't peg you
for a wuss.

27:17.132 --> 27:19.833
I guess you two have
a lot to talk about.

27:23.454 --> 27:24.722
All right,

27:24.756 --> 27:27.224
why would you tell people
that I'm afraid

27:27.258 --> 27:28.809
to let you go to New York?

27:30.261 --> 27:32.062
Because I'm afraid to go, okay?

27:32.097 --> 27:34.815
I just thought it'd be easier
to blame it on you.

27:34.849 --> 27:37.818
Well, you've never been afraid
of anything in your life.

27:37.852 --> 27:39.136
Because my life has been
pretty sheltered.

27:39.154 --> 27:41.071
Because you built that
ramp that I just rolled down

27:41.106 --> 27:42.573
so I could get
in the living room.

27:42.607 --> 27:44.408
Because you converted the den
into my bedroom

27:44.442 --> 27:46.143
so I didn't have to go upstairs.

27:46.161 --> 27:47.745
Because you built that
bathroom add-on...

27:47.779 --> 27:49.413
Artie, <i>you</i> did those things.

27:49.447 --> 27:51.915
They were all your suggestions.

27:51.950 --> 27:54.334
I didn't know how
to handle your needs.

27:54.369 --> 27:58.005
So you adapted and you will
adapt in New York.

27:58.039 --> 28:00.841
So what's the real reason
you don't want to go?

28:00.875 --> 28:03.427
I don't want to leave you alone.

28:03.461 --> 28:05.095
Ever since the accident,

28:05.130 --> 28:07.598
you've devoted every spare
moment to taking care of me.

28:07.632 --> 28:09.433
And it just feels selfish

28:09.467 --> 28:12.019
that the thanks I give
is packing up and leaving.

28:12.053 --> 28:14.271
Oh, honey,
that's exactly what I want.

28:14.305 --> 28:16.106
You have been dreaming
about making movies

28:16.141 --> 28:18.776
since you were a kid.

28:18.810 --> 28:20.060
You're going.

28:21.813 --> 28:23.280
I love you.

28:23.314 --> 28:25.182
I love you, too.

28:26.401 --> 28:31.905
And if you ever imply again
that I'm an old hag...

28:32.740 --> 28:34.324
...I'm gonna tip you over.

28:35.543 --> 28:37.161
Right.

28:41.332 --> 28:43.467
Going to New York.

28:43.501 --> 28:45.169
I don't know what
to say, Schwimmer,

28:45.203 --> 28:46.536
I'm in a hell of a mood today.

28:46.554 --> 28:50.007
So when you do inevitably
faceflop like a ragdoll,

28:50.041 --> 28:52.392
at least, I don't know,

28:52.427 --> 28:53.510
try to make me laugh.

28:53.544 --> 28:54.645
You know what?

28:54.679 --> 28:56.146
You've been wrong
about me all year,

28:56.181 --> 28:58.232
and you're gonna be
wrong about me again.

29:04.022 --> 29:05.889
What's this?

29:05.907 --> 29:07.357
This is your midterm.

29:08.693 --> 29:09.827
I don't understand.

29:09.861 --> 29:12.746
This is NYADA. We are
the best of the best,

29:12.780 --> 29:15.332
and make no mistake,
will crush you

29:15.366 --> 29:16.834
to get the role ourselves.

29:16.868 --> 29:19.503
But we are also family,

29:19.537 --> 29:21.371
we get through it together,

29:21.405 --> 29:23.757
and we celebrate each other
when there's big news.

29:23.791 --> 29:27.211
And this is big news.

29:27.245 --> 29:31.014
You've danced your way
through the fire all year,

29:31.049 --> 29:33.517
and you're still standing tall.

29:33.551 --> 29:36.937
So we are gonna get you through
this midterm

29:36.971 --> 29:40.423
so you can go kick
some NYADA ass

29:40.441 --> 29:43.560

Oh, my God, I was so surprise.

32:14.723 --> 32:17.392
All right, everyone.

32:17.410 --> 32:19.494
Ah, all right. Sit down.

32:21.664 --> 32:24.282
So, today's lesson...

32:24.333 --> 32:27.118
Well, I was gonna say "truth,"

32:27.169 --> 32:28.370
but it's about this
crazy-ass business

32:28.404 --> 32:30.338
that a lot of us
want to get into.

32:30.373 --> 32:32.457
If you're gonna tell us to not
even try 'cause it's too hard...

32:32.508 --> 32:34.409
No, no, I'm just saying
be ready.

32:34.427 --> 32:37.128
You know, when I graduated,
a producer said he wanted

32:37.179 --> 32:39.580
to do a CD of my music,
which, oh, my God,

32:39.598 --> 32:40.632
that's been my dream

32:40.683 --> 32:42.350
since before I even sat
in this room.

32:42.385 --> 32:45.470
Turns out, he only wanted
to do that on his terms.

32:45.521 --> 32:47.022
So I had a choice to make:

32:47.056 --> 32:49.641
I could do it his way and get
there a lot faster,

32:49.692 --> 32:54.479
or I could do it my way,
and maybe never,

32:54.530 --> 32:55.647
never even make it.

32:55.698 --> 32:58.533
So I talked go my parents
and my friends,

32:58.567 --> 33:00.601
and I made a decision.

33:00.619 --> 33:02.153
It's my voice, Martin.

33:02.204 --> 33:03.738
Those are my songs.

33:03.772 --> 33:05.490
They tell my story.

33:05.541 --> 33:08.576
I'm not gonna spend all
this time working on my truth,

33:08.610 --> 33:10.161
and then have you slap something

33:10.212 --> 33:12.831
that doesn't even represent
the real me on its cover.

33:12.882 --> 33:15.333
So, I don't have
a record deal anymore,

33:15.384 --> 33:18.837
but I do have a record, which
I'll be giving to all of you,

33:18.888 --> 33:22.006
and selling at a table in front
of my church and out of my car,

33:22.058 --> 33:23.842
and on Amazon, so,

33:23.893 --> 33:27.295
whatever happens, at least
I was true to myself.

33:27.313 --> 33:28.513
And you will have gotten there

33:28.564 --> 33:29.731
by taking... and you know
it's coming...

33:29.765 --> 33:31.850
the higher ground. Hit it!

Oh, she's back!

35:47.703 --> 35:49.270
Oh, thank you, everybody.

35:53.075 --> 35:55.560
Anderson, you wanted to see me?

35:55.611 --> 35:57.195
You're not going to sing
to me, too, are you?

35:57.229 --> 35:58.897
I just wanted to give you this.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.282
You can open it.

36:02.618 --> 36:05.236
I thought maybe you
could wear it at work

36:05.287 --> 36:06.687
to show support
for gay marriage.

36:06.705 --> 36:08.022
Oh, it's really sweet of you.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.191
Gay rights has been
my top issue,

36:10.209 --> 36:11.993
even though it makes me
wildly unpopular

36:12.027 --> 36:13.527
with my distinguished
colleagues.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.414
They're on the wrong side
of history, so screw 'em.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.585
I am so glad
that you feel that way,

36:20.636 --> 36:23.371
because assuming
that we legally can,

36:23.389 --> 36:26.925
um, I wanted to formally ask
for your permission

36:26.976 --> 36:29.093
to ask Kurt to marry me.

36:30.145 --> 36:32.647
You kidding, or you nuts?

36:34.650 --> 36:36.717
Kurt is my soul mate.

36:36.735 --> 36:38.770
I know that I've
hurt him badly,

36:38.821 --> 36:41.189
but I also know
that if I want to get him back,

36:41.223 --> 36:42.407
I have to do something bold.

36:42.441 --> 36:44.609
Blaine,

36:44.660 --> 36:46.778
it means a lot to me
that you love Kurt,

36:46.829 --> 36:50.114
and you know,
you've been like family to me...

36:50.165 --> 36:52.566
So, you' saying that you're okay

36:52.585 --> 36:54.419
with me asking for his hand?

36:54.453 --> 36:56.737
Oh, of course not.
No, you're still kids.

36:56.755 --> 36:59.424
Did you learn anything
from Finn and Rachel?

36:59.458 --> 37:01.125
They are completely different.

37:01.176 --> 37:02.460
Completely different.

37:02.511 --> 37:03.962
I don't think
that you understand

37:04.013 --> 37:05.296
how it feels

37:05.347 --> 37:08.249
to finally be able
to legally get married.

37:08.267 --> 37:12.470
And you don't really get
what it is to be married.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.422
Straight, gay, whatever.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.257
It's not the same
as living together.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.475
Blaine, listen,

37:17.526 --> 37:19.593
let's sit down for a second.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.613
Seriously, come here.

37:25.868 --> 37:28.820
Look, I can't tell you why,

37:28.871 --> 37:31.823
but something happens
when you exchange vows.

37:31.874 --> 37:34.492
It's a big deal.

37:34.543 --> 37:37.795
It's why getting divorce is
so much harder than breaking up.

37:37.830 --> 37:40.448
There's just
a really big difference

37:40.466 --> 37:43.918
between marrying a person

37:43.952 --> 37:46.137
and marrying an idea.

37:46.171 --> 37:47.505
What if he meets someone else?

37:47.556 --> 37:49.173
You think you two were meant to be?
Yes.

37:49.224 --> 37:51.459
Do you think you two
have a true love? Yes!

37:51.477 --> 37:52.844
Then stop worrying.

37:55.397 --> 37:57.348
I got to go.

37:57.399 --> 37:59.800
Thanks for the pin.
Sure.

37:59.818 --> 38:02.303
Hey...

38:02.321 --> 38:04.572
it's gonna be okay.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.359
How do you know that, though?

38:08.410 --> 38:12.530
When two people love each other
like you two do...

38:13.749 --> 38:15.583
...everything works out.

38:27.394 --> 38:29.028
Yes.

38:29.062 --> 38:30.363
All right, let's review.

38:30.397 --> 38:31.614
What are y'all gonna
do at regionals?

38:31.665 --> 38:33.032
Riff, run and grunt!

38:33.066 --> 38:34.450
Emote!
Commit!

38:34.501 --> 38:36.202
Step up to the plate
and embrace our talent.

38:36.236 --> 38:38.454
And just like my boo
Miss Mercedes Jones,

38:38.505 --> 38:40.290
we're gonna treat
every note we sing

38:40.341 --> 38:41.841
and every breath we take

38:41.875 --> 38:43.126
with a little
something-something

38:43.177 --> 38:45.345
we in the business of show
simply call "passion."

38:45.379 --> 38:46.679
And passion can be

38:46.714 --> 38:48.464
a scary thing,
but we shouldn't run

38:48.515 --> 38:49.882
or hide from it because

38:49.916 --> 38:51.884
passion is...
it's wonderful, yo.

38:51.918 --> 38:54.053
Auditorium,
4:00 p.m. sharp.

38:54.087 --> 38:56.055
I got a little jam
I'm gonna sing for all y'alls!

38:56.089 --> 38:58.741
And you best believe it's gonna
be sung with... say what?!

38:58.792 --> 39:00.743
Passion!

39:00.794 --> 39:02.078
Yes!
Thank you.

39:02.129 --> 39:04.030
Yes!

39:09.586 --> 39:11.421
What's that?

39:11.472 --> 39:12.755
It's a gift.

39:12.806 --> 39:14.724
I got it at the
Broadway Flea Market.

39:14.758 --> 39:19.429
It is Debbie Allen's original
cane from <i>Fame...</i> the movie.

39:19.463 --> 39:22.065
Hmm. I wanted to thank
you for what you did.

39:22.099 --> 39:23.049
The number?

39:23.067 --> 39:24.434
That's NYADA tradition.

39:24.485 --> 39:27.620
We do that when one of the tribe
gets a Broadway audition.

39:27.655 --> 39:29.939
Not the number.
I wanted to

39:29.990 --> 39:32.108
thank you for everything that
you've done for me this year.

39:32.159 --> 39:34.110
So... thank you.

39:34.161 --> 39:36.112
I've busted your ass
since September.

39:36.163 --> 39:37.229
You made me a better dancer.

39:37.247 --> 39:39.231
And that's why I came to NYADA,

39:39.249 --> 39:41.084
to learn and be challenged,

39:41.118 --> 39:43.753
and to work with the
best of the best.

39:43.787 --> 39:45.738
I saw something in you.

39:45.756 --> 39:48.741
That first day,
and I thought to myself,

39:48.759 --> 39:50.460
"This one's special.

39:50.511 --> 39:52.411
This one might make it."

39:52.429 --> 39:54.931
And that's why
I'm so relentless.

39:56.433 --> 39:58.918
Even the whole Brody thing?

39:58.936 --> 40:01.637
Well, that was
because of his abs.

40:01.689 --> 40:03.306
What? But yours are
so much better.

40:03.357 --> 40:04.590
When's your callback?

40:04.608 --> 40:06.526
Oh, it's next week.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.145
I am so nervous, Miss July.

40:09.196 --> 40:11.597
I've never wanted anything
more in my whole life.

40:11.615 --> 40:13.599
You're gonna get it.

40:13.617 --> 40:15.101
I know you will, Rachel.

40:29.383 --> 40:31.167
What's up?

40:31.218 --> 40:32.802
This is going to take
a lot of courage,

40:32.836 --> 40:35.338
considering our, um,
complicated history,

40:35.389 --> 40:36.839
and all the emotions
involved, so...

40:36.890 --> 40:40.309
um, I'm-I'm just gonna say it.

40:40.344 --> 40:41.928
Go ahead, you get kind of cute

40:41.962 --> 40:43.129
when you get nervous.

40:43.147 --> 40:45.314
Hmm... I...

40:45.349 --> 40:47.466
wanted to ask you if...

40:47.484 --> 40:49.468
well, will you...

40:49.486 --> 40:52.522
maybe s-stick around
for regionals?

40:52.573 --> 40:55.858
Oh! Oh, yeah, of course.

40:55.909 --> 40:57.693
Yeah, Mercedes and I
already talked about it.

40:57.745 --> 40:59.979
We want to stick around and root
you guys on at the competition.

40:59.997 --> 41:01.814
Yeah, we wouldn't miss
it for the world.

41:01.832 --> 41:03.166
Great.
Yeah.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.316
You know I would've said yes.

41:04.334 --> 41:05.651
Right?
I know...

41:05.669 --> 41:07.370
What a wonderful,
wonderful week.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.839
And with you in it,
a wonderful life.
