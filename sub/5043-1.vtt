13:09.611 --> 13:12.045
and that's the Kerian Abyss.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.515
Wait. What's this? What's this?
Why, it--it's...

13:15.549 --> 13:17.380
Treasure Planet.

13:17.418 --> 13:18.782
No!

13:18.818 --> 13:20.752
That's Treasure Planet!

13:20.787 --> 13:22.448
DOPPLER: Flint's trove?

13:22.489 --> 13:24.456
The loot of a thousand worlds?

13:24.490 --> 13:26.117
You know what this means?

13:26.158 --> 13:29.615
It means that all that treasure
is only a boat ride away.

13:29.660 --> 13:33.186
Whoever brings it back
would hold an eternal place...

13:33.230 --> 13:36.757
atop the pantheon of explorers!
He'd be able to experience--

13:36.800 --> 13:39.199
[Click]
Whoo! What just happened?

13:39.235 --> 13:42.295
Mom, this is it. This is
the answer to all our problems.

13:42.338 --> 13:44.567
Jim, there is
absolutely no way--

13:44.606 --> 13:47.166
Don't you remember,
all those stories?

13:47.208 --> 13:50.040
That's all they were--stories!

13:50.077 --> 13:51.203
With that treasure...

13:51.245 --> 13:53.872
we could rebuild the Benbow
a hundred times over!

13:53.913 --> 13:56.609
Well, this is--
it's just--oh, my.

13:56.649 --> 13:59.048
Delbert, would you please
explain how ridiculous this is?

13:59.084 --> 14:01.382
It's totally preposterous...

14:01.420 --> 14:03.444
traversing
the entire galaxy alone.

14:03.487 --> 14:05.546
SARAH: Now at last,
we hear some sense!

14:05.589 --> 14:08.216
-That's why I'm going with you.
-Delbert!

14:08.258 --> 14:10.658
I'll use my savings
to finance the expedition.

14:10.693 --> 14:14.150
I'll commission a ship,
hire a captain and a crew.

14:14.196 --> 14:15.493
You're not serious.

14:15.531 --> 14:18.124
All my life I've been waiting
for an opportunity like this...

14:18.166 --> 14:21.602
and here it is screaming,
''Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!''

14:21.636 --> 14:24.763
OK. OK! You're both grounded!

14:24.805 --> 14:25.999

JIM: Mom. look

14:27.974 --> 14:31.500
l know that I keep
messing everything up...

14:31.544 --> 14:34.273
and I know...

14:34.312 --> 14:36.303
that I let you down.

14:38.215 --> 14:40.979
But this is my chance
to make it up to you.

14:41.018 --> 14:43.679
I'm gonna set things right.

14:43.719 --> 14:46.449
Sarah?

14:46.489 --> 14:48.683
If I may?

14:48.723 --> 14:51.157
You said yourself,
you've tried everything.

14:51.193 --> 14:52.820
There are much worse
remedies...

14:52.861 --> 14:55.988
than a few character-building
months in space.

14:56.030 --> 14:58.827
Are you saying this
because it's the right thing...

14:58.865 --> 15:01.129
or because
you really want to go?

15:01.167 --> 15:03.896
l really, really, really,
really want to go...

15:03.936 --> 15:05.870
and it's the right thing.

15:10.741 --> 15:12.333
[Sighs]

15:13.343 --> 15:14.537
Jim...

15:14.578 --> 15:17.240
l don't want to lose you.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.806
Mom...you won't.

15:20.850 --> 15:23.011
I'll make you proud.

15:24.586 --> 15:26.611
DOPPLER: Well. uh. ahem

15:26.654 --> 15:28.211
There we are then.

15:28.255 --> 15:30.491
We'll begin preparations
at once.

15:30.491 --> 15:30.889
We'll begin preparations
at once.

15:30.924 --> 15:35.223
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be
off to the spaceport.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.622
[Breathing deeply]

16:25.401 --> 16:28.597
Well, Jim, this should be
a wonderful opportunity...

16:28.637 --> 16:30.798
for the two of us
to get to know one another.

16:30.839 --> 16:33.204
You know what they say,
familiarity breeds, um...

16:33.240 --> 16:35.208
well, contempt,
but, in our case--

16:35.242 --> 16:39.337
Look, let's just
find the ship. OK?

16:39.379 --> 16:40.505
[Clank]

16:40.606 --> 16:44.063
-Second berth on your right!
-You can't miss it.

Hey, thanks.

16:46.411 --> 16:49.004
It's the suit, isn't it?
l should never have listened...

16:49.046 --> 16:51.412
to that pushy
two-headed saleswoman.

16:51.448 --> 16:53.779
This one said it fit,
that one said it was my color.

16:53.816 --> 16:56.842

l get so flustered. Ooh!

16:58.186 --> 17:02.714
Oh, Jim! This is our ship!

How cool is this?

17:18.202 --> 17:19.362
[Squishing noise]

17:19.403 --> 17:21.200
Sorry about that.
l didn't mean--

17:21.239 --> 17:25.071
[Angry farting noises]

[Pffft]

17:40.554 --> 17:43.351
Flatula? Cool.

17:44.657 --> 17:47.649
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?

17:47.693 --> 17:51.321
Shipshape it is, sir,
but I'm not the captain.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.194
The captain's aloft.

17:56.066 --> 17:57.124
[Meow]

18:00.170 --> 18:02.365
Mr. Arrow, I've checked
this miserable ship...

18:02.405 --> 18:06.841
from stem to stern,
and, as usual, it's...spot on.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.899
Can you get nothing wrong?

18:08.943 --> 18:11.309
You flatter me, Captain.

18:13.147 --> 18:16.240
Ah, Dr. Doppler, I presume?

18:16.283 --> 18:18.080
Uh, um, yes. l--

18:18.118 --> 18:21.348
-Hello! Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can! Stop that banging!

18:21.387 --> 18:24.048
If I may, Doctor,
this works so much better...

18:24.088 --> 18:26.215
when it's right-way up
and plugged in.

18:26.257 --> 18:28.383
-Ooh!
-Lovely. There you go.

18:28.425 --> 18:31.053
If you don't mind,
l can manage my own plugging!

18:31.094 --> 18:32.220
I'm Captain Amelia...

with the Protean armada.

18:34.063 --> 18:36.258
Nasty business, but I won't
bore you with my scars.

18:36.299 --> 18:38.062
You've met
my first officer, Mr. Arrow.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.192

honest, brave, and true.

18:40.235 --> 18:41.862
Please, Captain.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.870
Oh, shut up, Arrow. You know
l don't mean a word of it.

18:43.904 --> 18:47.271
Ahem, excuse me. I hate to
interrupt this lovely banter...

18:47.308 --> 18:49.775

Jim Hawkins?

18:49.809 --> 18:53.108
Jim, you see, is the boy

Doctor, please!

18:55.347 --> 18:56.780
[Growls]

18:57.916 --> 19:00.383
I'd like a word with you
in my stateroom.

19:01.619 --> 19:07.079
Doctor, to muse and blabber
about a treasure map...

19:07.123 --> 19:09.090
in front of
this particular crew...

19:09.124 --> 19:11.354
demonstrates
a level of ineptitude...

19:11.393 --> 19:13.553
that borders
on the imbecilic...

19:13.595 --> 19:15.586
and I mean that
in a very caring way.

19:15.630 --> 19:19.087
Imbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, I've--

19:19.132 --> 19:20.759
May I see the map, please?

19:26.439 --> 19:27.599
Here.

19:29.207 --> 19:31.641
Hmm. Fascinating.

19:33.344 --> 19:35.312
Mr. Hawkins, in the future...

19:35.346 --> 19:37.246
you will address me
as ''Captain'' or ''Ma'am.''

19:37.281 --> 19:38.406
ls that clear?

19:38.448 --> 19:40.916
Ugh...

19:40.950 --> 19:42.247
Mr. Hawkins?

19:43.286 --> 19:46.254
-Yes, ma'am.
-That'll do.

19:46.288 --> 19:48.585
Gentlemen, this must be kept
under lock and key...

19:48.623 --> 19:51.387
when not in use.
And, Doctor, again...

19:51.425 --> 19:53.120
with the greatest
possible respect...

19:53.160 --> 19:55.184
zip your howling screamer.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.889
Captain, I assure you l--

19:56.930 --> 20:00.421
Let me make this
as monosyllabic as possible.

20:00.466 --> 20:04.765
l don't much care
for this crew you hired.

20:04.802 --> 20:07.202
They're...how did l
describe them, Arrow?

20:07.238 --> 20:09.569
l said something rather good
this morning before coffee.

20:09.606 --> 20:13.905
''A ludicrous parcel
of driveling galoots,'' ma'am.

20:13.943 --> 20:17.470
-There you go--poetry.
-Now, see here--

20:17.513 --> 20:21.676
Doctor, I'd love to chat--
tea, cake, the whole shebang--

20:21.716 --> 20:23.047
but I have a ship to launch...

20:23.084 --> 20:25.185
and you've got your outfit
to buff up.

20:25.185 --> 20:27.517
Mr. Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes...

20:27.554 --> 20:29.077
down to the galley
straightaway.

20:29.122 --> 20:31.852
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr. Silver.

20:31.891 --> 20:34.324
What? The cook?

20:35.697 --> 20:38.165
That woman! That...feline!

20:38.200 --> 20:40.394
Who does she think
is working for whom?

20:40.434 --> 20:42.766
It's my map, and
she's got me bussin' tables?

20:42.803 --> 20:45.532
I'll not tolerate a cross word
about our captain!

in this or any galaxy.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.718

have superluminal jets?

put you with me, eh?

23:44.248 --> 23:46.113
Whatever.

23:46.149 --> 23:51.552
Well, who be a humble cyborg
to argue with a captain?

23:51.587 --> 23:53.884
Yeah.

23:53.922 --> 23:56.914
You know...these purps...

23:56.958 --> 24:01.223

back home on Montressor.

24:02.897 --> 24:05.558

24:07.133 --> 24:09.794
Come to think of it,
just before I left...

24:09.835 --> 24:11.860
l met this old guy,
who was, um...

24:11.904 --> 24:15.270
he was kind of looking
for a cyborg buddy of his.

24:15.306 --> 24:16.603
ls that so?

24:16.641 --> 24:17.972
Yeah.

55:33.736 --> 55:35.430
[Powers up]

55:40.341 --> 55:42.400
-Aah!
-Aah!

55:42.443 --> 55:43.967
Oh, this is fantastic!

55:44.011 --> 55:47.036
A carbon-based life form
come to rescue me at last!

55:47.080 --> 55:49.071
l just want to hug you
and squeeze you...

55:49.115 --> 55:50.877
and hold you close to me.

55:50.916 --> 55:54.147
All right. OK.
Would you just let go of me?

55:54.186 --> 55:55.914
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

55:55.953 --> 55:59.548
It's just I've been marooned
for so long.

55:59.590 --> 56:02.251
l mean, solitude's fine.
Don't get me wrong.

56:02.292 --> 56:04.123
For heaven's sakes,
after a hundred years...

56:04.160 --> 56:07.788
you go a little nuts!
Ha ha ha!

56:07.830 --> 56:09.593
I'm sorry. Am l...

56:09.631 --> 56:11.029
l am, um...

56:11.065 --> 56:14.694
My name is, uh...

56:16.203 --> 56:18.865
[Cuckoo cuckoo]

56:18.905 --> 56:21.304
B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.

56:21.340 --> 56:24.036
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.

56:24.076 --> 56:25.702
-And you are?
-Jim.

56:25.744 --> 56:27.268
Oh, what a pleasure
to meet you, Jimmy.

56:27.312 --> 56:29.542
-It's Jim.
-Anyway...

56:29.581 --> 56:31.047
Look, I'm kind of
in a hurry, OK?

56:31.081 --> 56:33.675
l got to find a place to hide,
and there's pirates chasing me.

56:33.717 --> 56:36.913
Oh, pirates!
Don't get me started on pirates!

56:36.953 --> 56:40.012
l don't like them.
l remember Captain Flint.

56:40.055 --> 56:42.319
This guy had such a temper.

56:42.357 --> 56:44.450
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

56:44.493 --> 56:47.427
l think he suffered
from mood swings, personally.

56:47.461 --> 56:49.224
I'm not a therapist,
and anyway...

56:49.263 --> 56:51.389
but l--you let me know
when I'm rambling.

56:51.431 --> 56:52.762
But that means--but wait.

56:52.799 --> 56:55.164
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

56:55.200 --> 56:56.861
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?

56:56.902 --> 56:58.870
You know,
loot of a thousand worlds.

56:58.904 --> 57:00.837
It's--well, it's...

57:00.872 --> 57:04.399
it's all a little--
little--little fuzzy.

57:04.442 --> 57:08.036
Wait. l--l r-r-remember.

57:08.078 --> 57:10.136
l do. l--treasure!

57:10.179 --> 57:13.080
Lots of treasure
buried in the centroid--

57:13.115 --> 57:15.139
centroid--centroid
of the mechanism.

57:15.183 --> 57:18.448
And there was this big door
opening and closing...

57:18.486 --> 57:20.510
and opening and closing...

57:20.554 --> 57:22.146
and Captain Flint
wanted to make sure...

57:22.189 --> 57:23.781
nobody could ever
get to his treasure...

57:23.824 --> 57:26.815
so I helped him...
[Sputtering]

57:26.859 --> 57:29.419
Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!

57:29.462 --> 57:31.656
JIM: BEN ? BEN ? BEN !

57:31.696 --> 57:34.290
Reboot! Aah! And you are?

57:34.332 --> 57:35.696
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure?

57:35.733 --> 57:37.166
l want to say Larry.

57:37.201 --> 57:39.362
The--the centroid
of the mechanism, or--

57:39.403 --> 57:42.565
I'm sorry. My memory
isn't what it used to be.

57:42.605 --> 57:42.672
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.

57:42.672 --> 57:45.697
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.

57:45.741 --> 57:47.174
You haven't found it, have you?

57:47.209 --> 57:50.905
Uh, my missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?

57:50.945 --> 57:55.472
Look, B.E.N., I really need
to find a place to hide, OK?

57:55.515 --> 57:59.542
So I'm just gonna be,
you know, moving on.

57:59.586 --> 58:03.043
Oh, uh, so, well, then...

58:03.089 --> 58:06.956
l guess, uh...
this is good-bye, huh?

58:06.991 --> 58:11.893
I'm sorry that
I'm so dysfunctional.

58:11.929 --> 58:16.956
So, uh, go ahead and...
l do understand.

58:16.999 --> 58:20.456
l do. Bye-bye.

58:21.670 --> 58:23.570
[Whines]

58:23.605 --> 58:26.072
[Sighs] Look,
if you're gonna come along...

58:26.107 --> 58:27.802
you're gonna have
to stop talking.

58:27.842 --> 58:31.436
Huzzah! Ha ha ha!
Oh, this is fantastic!

58:31.478 --> 58:35.243
Me and my best buddy
are lookin' for a...

58:35.280 --> 58:36.804
[Clears throat]

58:36.849 --> 58:38.749
[Whispering] Being quiet.

58:38.784 --> 58:41.081
And you have to stop
touching me.

58:41.119 --> 58:44.782
Touching and talking.
That's my two big no-nos.

58:44.822 --> 58:46.880
OK. Now, I think
that we should--

58:46.923 --> 58:50.017
Say, listen, before we go out
on our big search...

58:50.059 --> 58:54.553
um, would you mind if we made
a quick pit stop at my place?

58:54.597 --> 58:56.564
[Chuckles] Kind of urgent.

58:56.598 --> 59:00.124
JIM: BEN. I think
you just solved my problem

59:04.238 --> 59:06.171
BEN:
Uh. pardon the mess. people

59:06.205 --> 59:07.331
You'd think
in a hundred years...

59:07.373 --> 59:09.204
l would've dusted
a little more often...

59:09.242 --> 59:11.573
but, you know,
when you're batchin' it...

59:11.610 --> 59:14.204
you tend to, uh, let things go.

59:14.246 --> 59:16.475
Aw, isn't that sweet?

59:16.514 --> 59:19.779
l find old-fashioned romance
so touching, don't you?

59:19.817 --> 59:21.647
How about drinks
for the happy couple?

59:21.684 --> 59:23.845
Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.

59:23.887 --> 59:25.786
Thank you, we don't drink...

59:25.821 --> 59:28.085
and, uh, we're not a couple.

59:30.158 --> 59:32.626
Ahem.
Look at these markings.

59:32.660 --> 59:35.992
They're identical
to the ones on the map.

59:36.029 --> 59:38.156
l suspect these are
the hieroglyphic remnants...

59:38.198 --> 59:39.927
of an ancient culture.

59:39.966 --> 59:41.455
CAPTAIN AMELIA: Mr Hawkins

59:41.500 --> 59:44.435
stop anyone
who tries to approach. Ohh!

59:44.470 --> 59:46.027
Yes, yes. Now listen to me...

59:46.070 --> 59:50.267
stop giving orders for a few
milliseconds and lie still.

59:50.307 --> 59:52.400
Very forceful, Doctor.

59:52.442 --> 59:54.501
Go on. Say something else.

59:54.545 --> 59:54.715
BEN: Hey. look! There's
some more of your buddies!

59:54.715 --> 59:57.945
BEN: Hey. look! There's
some more of your buddies!

59:57.984 --> 01:00:00.952
Hey, fellas!
We're over here, fellas!

01:00:00.986 --> 01:00:04.080
Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!

01:00:06.156 --> 01:00:10.353
Stop wastin' your fire!

01:00:11.394 --> 01:00:13.885
SILVER: Hello. up there!

01:00:16.398 --> 01:00:18.093
Jimbo?

01:00:18.133 --> 01:00:21.499
If it's all right
with the captain...

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:24.436
I'd like a short word with ya.

01:00:24.472 --> 01:00:28.066
No tricks,
just a little palaver.

01:00:28.108 --> 01:00:30.803
Come to bargain for the map,
doubtless.

01:00:30.843 --> 01:00:31.969
Pestilential...

01:00:32.011 --> 01:00:34.070
-Ugh!
-Captain.

01:00:34.113 --> 01:00:39.550
That means...that he thinks
we still have it.

01:00:44.454 --> 01:00:50.391
Ah, Morphy! I wondered
where you was off to.

01:00:50.425 --> 01:00:52.416
[Groaning]

01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:55.256
Ooh.

01:00:55.295 --> 01:00:58.594
Oh, this poor old leg's
downright snarky...

01:00:58.632 --> 01:01:01.600
since that game attack
we had in the galley.

01:01:01.634 --> 01:01:03.659
[Chuckles]

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:05.294
Ahh.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:10.306
Whatever you heard
back there...

01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:12.605
at least the part
concerning you...

01:01:12.643 --> 01:01:16.510
l didn't mean a word of it.

01:01:16.546 --> 01:01:20.675
Had that bloodthirsty lot
thought I'd gone soft...

01:01:20.716 --> 01:01:23.150
they'd have gutted us both.

01:01:25.286 --> 01:01:29.814
Listen to me.
If we play our cards right...

01:01:29.857 --> 01:01:35.158
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

01:01:35.194 --> 01:01:37.628
-Yeah?
-Ha ha ha.

01:01:37.663 --> 01:01:40.756
You get me that map...

01:01:40.799 --> 01:01:42.562
and, uh...

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.093
an even portion
of the treasure is yours.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.128
[Chuckles]

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:55.141
Boy.

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:57.839
You are really something.

01:01:57.879 --> 01:02:00.574
All that talk of greatness...

01:02:00.614 --> 01:02:04.209
light coming off my sails...
what a joke.

01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:06.047
Now, just see here, Jimbo--

01:02:06.086 --> 01:02:07.314
l mean, at least
you taught me one thing.

01:02:07.353 --> 01:02:08.718
Stick to it, right?

01:02:08.755 --> 01:02:10.722
Well, that's just
what I'm gonna do.

01:02:10.756 --> 01:02:12.383
I'm gonna make sure
that you never see...

01:02:12.424 --> 01:02:15.052
one drabloon of my treasure!

01:02:15.094 --> 01:02:18.620
That treasure is owed me,
by thunder!

01:02:18.663 --> 01:02:23.031
Well, try to find it
without my map, by thunder!

01:02:23.066 --> 01:02:28.162
Oh, you still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

01:02:28.204 --> 01:02:31.639
Now, mark me.

01:02:31.673 --> 01:02:35.301
Either I get that map
by dawn tomorrow...

01:02:35.342 --> 01:02:39.472
or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons...

01:02:39.513 --> 01:02:43.312
to blast ya all
to kingdom come!

01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:46.374
Morph, hop to it.

01:02:47.752 --> 01:02:49.219
Now!

01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:53.552
Oh, blast it!

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.996
Gentlemen...

01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:10.969
we must stay together and...

01:03:11.004 --> 01:03:12.835
and...ohh.

01:03:12.873 --> 01:03:14.670
And what? What?!

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.232
We must stay together
and what?!

01:03:17.276 --> 01:03:22.770
Doctor,
you have wonderful eyes.

01:03:22.814 --> 01:03:24.406
She's lost her mind!

01:03:24.449 --> 01:03:25.676
Well, you gotta help her.

01:03:25.716 --> 01:03:28.048
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

01:03:28.085 --> 01:03:30.450
l mean, I am a doctor,
but I'm not that kind of doctor.

01:03:30.486 --> 01:03:32.113
l have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.

01:03:32.155 --> 01:03:33.622
You can't help people
with a doctorate.

01:03:33.656 --> 01:03:36.180
You just sit there,
and you're useless.

01:03:36.224 --> 01:03:38.488
It's OK, Doc.

01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:40.256
It's all right.

01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:43.695
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly
how to get out of this.

01:03:43.731 --> 01:03:46.858
It's just Jimmy
has this knowledge of things.

01:03:46.966 --> 01:03:50.526
Jim, any thoughts at all?

01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:53.663
Without the map, we're dead.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.672
If we try to leave, we're dead.

01:03:57.708 --> 01:03:59.699
-If we stay here--
-We're dead!

01:03:59.744 --> 01:04:01.210
We're dead! We're dead!

01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:10.011
Well, I think that Jimmy could
use a little quiet time. Heh.

01:04:10.052 --> 01:04:13.282
So I'll just slip out
the back door.

01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:15.515
-Back door?
-Oh, yeah.

01:04:15.555 --> 01:04:17.716
l get this delightful breeze
through here...

01:04:17.758 --> 01:04:19.020
which I think is important...

01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:20.457
because ventilation
among friends--

01:04:20.493 --> 01:04:23.053
Whoa What is all this stuff?

01:04:23.095 --> 01:04:25.358
You mean the miles and miles
of machinery that run

01:04:25.397 --> 01:04:27.627
through the entire course
of the inside of this planet?

01:04:27.665 --> 01:04:29.360
Not a clue.

01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:31.800
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think
l found a way out of here!

01:04:31.835 --> 01:04:34.303
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay--

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:37.238
-I'll be back.
-Cannonball!

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:38.865
Woof.

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:40.932
[Snoring]

01:04:47.114 --> 01:04:49.639
-So, what's the plan?
-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.

01:04:53.753 --> 01:04:55.118
[Whispering] OK, here it is.

01:04:55.155 --> 01:04:58.681
We sneak back to the Legacy,
disable the laser cannons...

01:04:58.724 --> 01:05:00.384
and bring back the map.

01:05:00.425 --> 01:05:01.653
[Muffled] That's a good plan.

01:05:01.692 --> 01:05:03.284
l like that plan.
The only thing is...

01:05:03.327 --> 01:05:05.760
I'm wondering,
how do we get there?

01:05:05.796 --> 01:05:07.229
On that.

01:05:07.264 --> 01:05:09.425
MORPH: Ooh.

01:05:13.669 --> 01:05:16.000
Oop? [Poink]

01:05:18.473 --> 01:05:19.906
-Aah!
-BEN. shh!

01:05:19.941 --> 01:05:23.000
Sorry. sorry Sorry

01:05:29.449 --> 01:05:32.110
OK, I'll get the map.
You wait here.

01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:34.812
Roger, Jimmy. I'll neutralize
laser cannons, sir!

01:05:34.853 --> 01:05:36.319
B.E.N.! B.E.N.!

01:05:36.353 --> 01:05:39.151
Yo-ho. yo-ho.
a pirate's life for me

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:41.453
[Humming]
[Sighs]

01:05:41.491 --> 01:05:45.449
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?

01:05:45.494 --> 01:05:48.190
All we gotta do is find
that one little wire.

01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:51.892
[Gasps] Oh, mama.

01:05:56.736 --> 01:05:58.465
[Sighs] Yes.

01:05:58.505 --> 01:05:59.802
[Alarm blaring]

So that's how Flint did it.

01:12:23.052 --> 01:12:28.250
He used this portal to roam
the universe stealing treasure.

01:12:28.289 --> 01:12:30.688

Buried in the centroid
of the mechanism.

What if the whole planet
is the mechanism...

01:12:47.605 --> 01:12:51.870
and the treasure is buried
in the center of this planet?

l can't tell you how
frustrating this is, Jimmy...

01:14:24.019 --> 01:14:25.509
'cause there's something just--

01:14:25.553 --> 01:14:27.645
it's nagging
at the back of my mind.

Aah!

01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:32.914

-ln the flesh!

resembles flesh...

01:14:39.531 --> 01:14:41.521
that's not there.

01:14:41.565 --> 01:14:43.624
And yet it's so odd. you know?

01:14:43.668 --> 01:14:46.727
I remember there was
something horrible

01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:48.829
Flint didn't want
anyone else to know

01:14:48.872 --> 01:14:52.864
but h--h just can't
remember what it was

01:14:52.908 --> 01:14:56.274
Oh, a mind
is a terrible thing to lose!

It's all flooding back!
All my memories!

01:15:19.163 --> 01:15:20.891
Right up until Flint
pulled my memory circuits...

01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:23.831
so I could never tell anybody
about his booby trap!

-Speaking of which...
-Huh?

01:15:30.038 --> 01:15:31.163
Flint wanted to make sure...

01:15:31.205 --> 01:15:32.604
that nobody could ever
steal his treasure...

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.902
so he rigged
this whole planet...

01:15:33.941 --> 01:15:37.239

Aah! We were better off
on exploding planet!

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.924
Take us out of here, metal man!

01:19:56.961 --> 01:19:58.451
Aye, Captain!

01:20:02.065 --> 01:20:04.863
Captain, you dropped from
the heavens in the nick of--

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:07.630
Save your claptrap
for the judge, Silver!

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:09.103
[Chuckles]

01:20:18.045 --> 01:20:19.706
Missile tail demobilized,
Captain!

01:20:19.746 --> 01:20:21.508
Thrusters at only 30%
of capacity.

01:20:21.547 --> 01:20:23.481
30% ? That means we're--

01:20:23.516 --> 01:20:26.609
We'll never clear
the planet's explosion in time.

01:20:34.491 --> 01:20:37.391
-We gotta turn around.
-What?

01:20:37.427 --> 01:20:40.328
There's a portal back there.
It can get us out of here!

01:20:40.363 --> 01:20:42.660
DOPPLER: Pardon me. Jim.
but didn't that portal open

01:20:42.698 --> 01:20:44.859
onto a raging inferno?!

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:47.868
Yes, but I'm gonna change that.

01:20:47.902 --> 01:20:50.564
I'm gonna open
a different door

01:20:51.905 --> 01:20:53.202
Captain, really, I don't see
how this is possible--

01:20:53.239 --> 01:20:55.400
Listen to the boy!

01:20:55.442 --> 01:20:58.001
One minute, twenty-nine seconds
till planet's destruction!

01:20:58.043 --> 01:21:01.534
-What do you need, Jim?
-Just some way to attach this.

01:21:01.579 --> 01:21:04.070
All right. Stand back.
Stand back, now.

01:21:05.683 --> 01:21:07.912
There you go.

01:21:07.951 --> 01:21:09.145
There you go.

01:21:10.253 --> 01:21:12.652
OK. Now,
no matter what happens...

01:21:12.688 --> 01:21:15.156
keep the ship heading
straight for that portal.

01:21:15.191 --> 01:21:18.057
BEN: Fifty-eight seconds!

01:21:24.932 --> 01:21:27.024
Well, you heard him!

01:21:27.066 --> 01:21:30.399
Get this blasted heap
turned 'round!

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:32.994
Doctor,
head us back to the portal.

01:21:33.038 --> 01:21:34.403
Aye, Captain.

01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:58.753
Go to the right! The right!

01:21:58.792 --> 01:22:02.386
l know, I know!
Will you just let me drive?!

01:22:04.597 --> 01:22:06.461
Twenty-five seconds!

01:22:11.401 --> 01:22:12.834
No! No!

01:22:16.305 --> 01:22:18.102
Come on, lad.

01:22:19.575 --> 01:22:22.407
Seventeen seconds!

01:22:37.456 --> 01:22:38.787
BEN: Seven

01:22:38.824 --> 01:22:41.883
sixfivefour

01:22:41.926 --> 01:22:44.451
three...two...

01:22:52.535 --> 01:22:55.527
Wow! Yeah!

01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:58.562
SILVER: You done it. Jimmy!

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:02.200
You done it, boy! Ha ha ha!

01:23:02.242 --> 01:23:04.836
Didn't I say the lad
had greatness in him?

01:23:04.878 --> 01:23:07.345
[Cheering]

01:23:17.087 --> 01:23:20.784
Unorthodox,
but ludicrously effective.

01:23:20.825 --> 01:23:22.689
CAPTAIN AMELIA: I'd be proud
to recommend you

01:23:22.725 --> 01:23:26.421
to the interstellar academy
They could use a man like you

01:23:26.461 --> 01:23:29.396
Just wait until your mother
hears about this!

01:23:29.431 --> 01:23:31.591
Of course, we may downplay
the life-threatening parts.

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:35.500
Jimmy, that was unforgettable!

01:23:35.536 --> 01:23:36.832
l know you don't like
touching...

01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:40.101
but get ready for a hug,
big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.333
Ha ha ha ha!

01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:45.607
Hey, you hugged me back.

01:23:45.644 --> 01:23:48.441
Oh, I promised myself
l wouldn't cry.

01:23:48.479 --> 01:23:50.413
[Sobbing]

01:23:54.685 --> 01:23:57.653
BEN:
Does anyone have a tissue?

01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.059
[Morph squeaking]

01:23:59.095 --> 01:24:02.257
-Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
-l know.

01:24:02.297 --> 01:24:04.561
JIM: You never quit. do you ?

01:24:04.599 --> 01:24:07.328
Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha!

01:24:07.368 --> 01:24:09.427
l was merely
checking to make sure...

01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:12.597
our last longboat
was safe and secure.

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:16.207
Mmm.

01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:17.401
Well...

01:24:19.011 --> 01:24:20.171
that should hold it.

01:24:20.212 --> 01:24:23.703
Heh heh heh.
l taught you too well.

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:29.241
If you don't mind,
we'd just as soon avoid prison.

01:24:29.286 --> 01:24:34.382
Little morphy here,
he's a free spirit.

01:24:34.423 --> 01:24:38.153
Being in a cage,
it'd break his heart.

01:24:38.192 --> 01:24:39.386
[Squeaks]

01:24:51.536 --> 01:24:53.527
Ohh!

01:24:55.774 --> 01:24:59.174
What say you ship out
with us, lad?

01:24:59.209 --> 01:25:01.540
You and me,
Hawkins and Silver...

01:25:01.577 --> 01:25:06.343
full of ourselves
and no ties to anyone!

01:25:08.583 --> 01:25:12.916
You know,
when I got on this boat...

01:25:12.954 --> 01:25:17.049
l would've taken you up
on that offer in a second...

01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:21.423
but, uh,
l met this old cyborg...

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:24.918
and he taught me that
l could chart my own course.

01:25:27.598 --> 01:25:29.190
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:25:29.233 --> 01:25:35.865
And what do you see
of that pal of yours?

01:25:35.906 --> 01:25:37.395
A future.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:40.034
[Chuckles] Why...

01:25:40.076 --> 01:25:45.103
look at ya,
glowing like a solar fire.

01:25:45.146 --> 01:25:47.875
You're something special, Jim.

01:25:47.915 --> 01:25:52.044
You're gonna rattle the stars,
you are.

01:25:58.991 --> 01:26:00.856
[Clears throat]

01:26:00.892 --> 01:26:03.792
Got a bit of grease
in this cyborg eye of mine.

01:26:03.828 --> 01:26:05.022
[Sniffles]

01:26:07.597 --> 01:26:09.155
[Sobbing]

01:26:09.199 --> 01:26:12.998
Oh, hey, Morph.
I'll see ya around, OK?

01:26:13.035 --> 01:26:14.195
See ya around.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.339
[Sniffs]

01:26:23.677 --> 01:26:27.271
Morphy, I got a job for ya.

01:26:27.313 --> 01:26:32.579
l need you to keep an eye
on this here pup.

01:26:34.953 --> 01:26:37.580
Will ya do me
that little favor?

01:26:37.621 --> 01:26:39.179
Aye-aye, Captain.

01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:48.289
Oh, and one more thing.

01:26:48.330 --> 01:26:49.729
[Chuckles]

01:26:49.765 --> 01:26:52.096
This is for your dear mother...

01:26:52.133 --> 01:26:55.227
to rebuild that inn of hers.

01:26:57.370 --> 01:26:57.437
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scalawag.

01:26:57.437 --> 01:27:00.565
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scalawag.

01:27:00.607 --> 01:27:03.166
[Laughs] Why, Jimbo, lad...

01:27:03.208 --> 01:27:06.075
when have I ever done otherwise?

01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:08.078
[Laughing]

01:27:39.364 --> 01:27:42.355
Oh! [Giggling]

01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:49.661
[Cheering]

01:28:05.185 --> 01:28:07.209
[Yawns]

01:28:08.253 --> 01:28:09.550
[All gasp]

01:28:12.423 --> 01:28:14.550
[All cheer]

01:28:20.397 --> 01:28:23.456
[Playing music]

01:28:33.407 --> 01:28:35.398
[Crying]

01:28:39.245 --> 01:28:40.735
[Laughing]

01:28:51.654 --> 01:28:53.645
[Song starts]

01:29:12.204 --> 01:29:16.731
It's good to see the sun
and feel this place

01:29:16.774 --> 01:29:20.972
This place I never thought
would feel like home

01:29:21.012 --> 01:29:23.275
And I ran forever

01:29:23.313 --> 01:29:25.508
Far away

01:29:25.549 --> 01:29:30.144
And I always thought
I'd end up here alone

01:29:30.186 --> 01:29:33.916
Somehow
the world has changed

01:29:33.955 --> 01:29:36.082
And I've come home

01:29:36.124 --> 01:29:40.355
To give you back the things
they took from you

01:29:40.394 --> 01:29:42.384
And I feel you now

01:29:42.428 --> 01:29:44.623
I'm not alone

01:29:44.664 --> 01:29:50.898
I always know
where you are

01:29:50.936 --> 01:29:53.335
When I see myself

01:29:53.371 --> 01:29:59.866
I always know
where you are

01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:04.846
Where you are

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.940
And I found something
that was always there

01:30:08.983 --> 01:30:13.578
Sometimes it's got to hut
before you feel

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:17.988
But now I'm strong.
and I won't kneel

01:30:18.024 --> 01:30:22.016
Except to thank
who's watching over me

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:26.224
And somehow
h feel so strong

01:30:26.264 --> 01:30:30.199
And I've begun
to be the one

01:30:30.234 --> 01:30:32.463
I never thought I'd be

01:30:32.502 --> 01:30:34.663
And I feel you now

01:30:34.704 --> 01:30:37.137
I'm not alone

01:30:37.172 --> 01:30:43.235
I always know
where you are

01:30:43.277 --> 01:30:45.802
And when I see myself

01:30:45.846 --> 01:30:52.181
I always know
where you are

01:30:52.217 --> 01:30:57.586
Where you are

01:30:57.622 --> 01:31:01.149
Now it's all so clear

01:31:01.192 --> 01:31:03.489
And I believe

01:31:03.527 --> 01:31:07.394
That everything's been
opened up to me

01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:09.489
And I feel you now

01:31:09.532 --> 01:31:11.829
I'm not alone

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.834
I always know

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:20.397
I always know
where you are

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:22.772
And when I see myself

01:31:22.809 --> 01:31:29.145
I always know
where you are

01:31:29.181 --> 01:31:31.172
And when I feel the sun

01:31:31.216 --> 01:31:37.744
I always know
where you are

01:31:37.787 --> 01:31:40.221
And when I see myself

01:31:40.256 --> 01:31:46.490
I always know
where you are

01:31:46.528 --> 01:31:52.226
Where you are

01:31:53.305 --> 01:31:59.620
