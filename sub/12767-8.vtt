PREVIOUSLY
ON "PRIVATE PRACTICE"...

00:08.542 --> 00:10.583
(Meg) I FIGURE WE CAN SEE
WHAT THIS IS.
I WANT A DIVORCE.

00:10.625 --> 00:13.291
(Violet) YES, YOU DO.
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
CALLED WEGENER'S DISEASE.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.166
(Doug) I MAY NOT
BE IN LOVE WITH HER,

00:15.208 --> 00:17.500
BUT I'M STAYING WITH MY WIFE.
(Violet) THE CONSTRUCTION ON
THE FOURTH FLOOR

00:17.542 --> 00:19.875
IS FOR
A COMPETING MEDICAL PRACTICE

00:19.917 --> 00:21.625
THAT CHARLOTTE IS RUNNING.
I'M DONE, CHARLOTTE.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.625
(Kevin) I GOT SHOT.
KEVIN, HEY.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.542
(music playing on tv)

00:25.583 --> 00:26.959
OH, COME ON.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.458
THAT IS THE WORST RUNWAY WALK
I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.458
SHE'S NOT FIERCE.
ELIMINATE HER.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.041
(telephone rings)

00:33.083 --> 00:34.041
(ring)

00:34.083 --> 00:35.458
COOPER, I TOLD YOU,

00:35.500 --> 00:38.792
WHEN THE MODELS ARE WALKING,
DO NOT CALL.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.291
DOUG?

00:49.667 --> 00:50.625
DOUG?

00:50.667 --> 00:52.250
COME UPSTAIRS.

00:52.291 --> 00:54.166
D-DOUG? WHAT'S THE--

00:54.208 --> 00:56.166
UPSTAIRS.

00:56.208 --> 00:57.625
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:57.667 --> 01:00.458
WHERE'S KAREN?

01:00.500 --> 01:02.750
DOUG?

01:04.333 --> 01:06.417
SHE'S IN THERE.
K-KAREN.

01:06.458 --> 01:09.000
SHE'S BEEN SO SICK,
SO SICK,

01:09.041 --> 01:12.250
AND... OH, MY GOD.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO CALL.

01:12.291 --> 01:16.208
YOU'RE STILL MY THERAPIST.
I... I DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO CALL.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.750
OKAY. IT'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.458
DOUG?

01:31.500 --> 01:33.875
I KILLED HER.

01:33.917 --> 01:36.458
I KILLED MY WIFE.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.500
(grunts)

01:40.542 --> 01:42.375
AAH!

01:43.750 --> 01:45.250
YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.709
OH, COME ON, MAN.

01:46.750 --> 01:48.709
IF YOU DIDN'T SUCK,
YOU WOULDN'T GET HIT.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.041
I DON'T SUCK.
I PLAYED ON A TEAM, MAN.

01:51.083 --> 01:53.041
YOU SUCK.
OH, SAY THAT TO MY FACE.

01:53.083 --> 01:55.417
I AM SAYING IT TO YOUR FACE.
YOU SUCK!

01:55.458 --> 01:57.458
(laughs)

01:57.500 --> 02:00.041
(pants) OH, WE NEED WOMEN.

02:00.083 --> 02:03.583
WORD.
OH. I HATE RACQUETBALL.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.166
MAN, SHE'S WORKING
IN OUR BUILDING.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.041
CHARLOTTE IS
WORKING IN THE BUILDING.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.542
I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM HER.
WELL, NAOMI--
SHE'S RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

02:09.583 --> 02:12.542
YOU THINK THAT'S EASY?
YOU KNOW,
I WISH SHE WOULD JUST DIE.

02:12.583 --> 02:16.083
WHOA.
NO, NOT IN A BAD WAY.
JUST LIKE... SLIGHTLY DEAD.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.375
YOU KNOW, THEN I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO SEE HER FACE.

02:18.417 --> 02:21.125
SHE'D JUST BE A MEMORY.
YOU EVER WISH NAOMI DEAD?
HEY, MAN.

02:21.166 --> 02:23.583
THAT'S... THE MOTHER OF
MY CHILD. YES, I DO, ACTUALLY.

02:23.625 --> 02:27.333
WHEN SHE HAD SEX WITH THAT GUY,
I WISHED SHE WAS DEAD.

02:27.375 --> 02:29.542
YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO AGAIN.
I GOT YOU.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.333
(cell phone rings)

02:31.375 --> 02:33.333
HOLD UP.

02:33.375 --> 02:34.709
(ring)

02:34.750 --> 02:36.792
WHAT'S UP, VIOLET?
SHE'S CALLING YOU?

02:36.834 --> 02:39.166
SHE WOULDN'T LET ME CALL HER
WHEN THE MODELS ARE WALKING.

02:39.208 --> 02:43.500
WHY IS SHE CALLING YOU?
TRAITOR.
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.500
JUST A FEW MORE NOTES TO MAKE.
TEN MINUTES TOPS.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.709
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.583
I FIGURE I COULD GET
5 MILES IN BEFORE BED.
YOU RAN THIS MORNING,
AND YOU DON'T RUN.

02:50.625 --> 02:53.166
WHO ARE YOU, AND WHAT
HAVE YOU DONE WITH MEG?

02:53.208 --> 02:55.166
I AM BORED.
I'M OUT-OF-MY-HEAD BORED.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.625
I'M RUNNING BORED.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.709
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO ALL DAY?
NOTHING.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.041
AND AFTER THAT, NOTHING,
AND THEN A LITTLE MORE NOTHING.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.959
I MEAN, WHAT DO PEOPLE DO ALL
DAY WHO DON'T HAVE JOBS OR KIDS?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.542
'CAUSE I CAN'T SPEND
ALL MY TIME

03:06.583 --> 03:08.583
RUNNING AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.041
MY THIGHS ARE KILLING ME.
I'M FREAKING OUT HERE.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.041
I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING
BEING IN A NEW PLACE,

03:13.083 --> 03:15.000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE YOU FIT IN,

03:15.041 --> 03:17.792
BUT DON'T RUN.
YOU KNOW, GET A JOB.
A JOB?

03:17.834 --> 03:18.792
YEAH.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.417
NOW WHY DON'T WE...

03:20.458 --> 03:22.417
HURT YOUR THIGHS
A LITTLE MORE...

03:22.458 --> 03:23.417
(chuckles)

03:23.458 --> 03:25.458
IN A NON-RUNNING WAY?

03:25.500 --> 03:26.709
(laughs)

03:29.625 --> 03:31.333
I'M GOING HOME.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.041
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.
I-I DON'T WANT TO--JUST--

03:34.083 --> 03:36.667
WOULD YOU JUST STOP BATHING ME
LIKE I'M AN INVALID?

03:36.709 --> 03:38.959
YOU GOT SHOT. YOU WANT TO BE
BOTH SHOT AND DIRTY?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.041
I'M SERIOUS. I DON'T WANT
TO BE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.625
I DON'T WANT TO BE...
I DON'T WANT TO BE A BURDEN.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.917
YOU'RE NOT A BURDEN.
KEVIN, LOOK AT ME.

03:46.959 --> 03:48.041
(sighs)

03:48.083 --> 03:50.083
YOU'RE NOT A BURDEN.

03:50.125 --> 03:53.000
LET ME TAKE CARE OF YOU.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.250
KAREN WAS OUT OF HER HEAD
WITH THE PAIN.

03:58.291 --> 04:00.500
THE BLOOD--SHE WAS ALWAYS
SPITTING UP BLOOD.

04:00.542 --> 04:02.417
HER CONDITION WAS FATAL.
YOU KNOW THAT.

04:02.458 --> 04:05.750
AND--AND SHE WAS BEGGING ME
TO HELP HER, SO I JUST... I DID.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.834
I HELPED HER.
(Sam) ALL RIGHT, KAREN
WAS SICK FOR MONTHS,

04:08.875 --> 04:11.625
AND I KNOW THAT SHE WAS DYING,
BUT THERE WERE

04:11.667 --> 04:14.208
SO MANY OTHER WAYS THAT YOU
COULD'VE HELPED HER--

04:14.250 --> 04:16.291
PALLIATIVE CARE,
PAIN MANAGEMENT.
SHE DIDN'T WANT THAT.

04:16.333 --> 04:19.041
SHE--SHE WAS DONE.
SHE JUST WANTED TO GO.

04:19.083 --> 04:22.542
SO YOU SHOT HER IN THE HEAD?
SAM, DOUG HAS BEEN THROUGH
A TRAUMA.

04:22.583 --> 04:24.417
THEY HAD A TROUBLED MARRIAGE.

04:24.458 --> 04:27.917
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA LEAVE HER
BEFORE I DIAGNOSED HER.

04:27.959 --> 04:30.625
KAREN WAS...
SHE WAS HELPLESS.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

04:30.667 --> 04:33.250
(man) TIME TO GO.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.667
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO HELP HER.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.417
SO YOU'RE HIS SHRINK,
AND, UH, WHO ARE YOU?

04:41.458 --> 04:43.500
DR. BENNETT IS--
WAS KAREN'S DOCTOR.

04:43.542 --> 04:46.625
KAREN WAS SUFFERING
FROM KIDNEY FAILURE

04:46.667 --> 04:48.041
SECONDARY
TO WEGENER'S DISEASE.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.917
YEAH, SHE WAS SICK.
I GET IT.

04:50.959 --> 04:53.875
DID HE EVER TALK ABOUT HURTING
HIS WIFE, WANTING HER DEAD?
UH, WELL, I--WHEN WE--

04:53.917 --> 04:57.166
WELL, WHATEVER HE SAID
IS PRIVILEGED.
SO YOU'RE OKAY
PROTECTING A MURDERER?

04:57.208 --> 05:00.542
I'M PROTECTING MY PATIENT.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, DR. BENNETT?
YOU GONNA STAY SILENT,

05:00.583 --> 05:03.041
OR ARE YOU GONNA PROTECT
YOUR PATIENT--KAREN?

05:03.083 --> 05:04.667
WE'RE LEAVING.
(Sam) UM--

05:04.709 --> 05:06.083
SAM.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.375
THE ELEVATOR'S MINE.

05:20.417 --> 05:23.375
YOU CAN HAVE THE FOURTH FLOOR,
BUT THE ELEVATOR'S MINE.

05:23.417 --> 05:26.000
YOU CAN TAKE THE STAIRS.
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE DAY
TO CALM YOURSELF DOWN,

05:26.041 --> 05:28.917
THEN WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THIS
LIKE GROWN ADULTS.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.625
(elevator bell dings)

05:30.667 --> 05:34.417
TELL YOU WHAT, CHARLOTTE,
GO TO HELL.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.709
OH, MY GOD. HE SHOT HER?
WAIT, HE SHOT HER
SHOT HER?

05:39.750 --> 05:42.041
(Pete) AS IN KILLED HER
SHOT HER.
KILLED WHO?

05:42.083 --> 05:44.041
DOUG ADAMS MURDERED
HIS WIFE LAST NIGHT.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.041
HE--HE DID NOT MURDER HER.

05:46.083 --> 05:50.000
HE SAID SHE BEGGED HIM
TO DO IT.
OH, GOD, THAT POOR MAN.
THAT POOR WOMAN.

05:50.041 --> 05:53.125
THEN IT WAS A MERCY KILLING?
YES, YES. DELL GETS IT.
IT WAS EUTHANASIA.

05:53.166 --> 05:56.750
IT WAS A BULLET TO THE BRAIN.
LOOK, I-I KNOW DOUG,

05:56.792 --> 05:58.750
AND HE IS NOT THE TYPE TO--
THERE IS NO TYPE.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.625
REGULAR NORMAL PEOPLE ARE
DRIVEN TO MURDER EVERY DAY.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.834
RIGHT? LOVE?
LOVE WILL DO IT EVERY TIME.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.959
TWISTED, SICK,
MESSED UP LOVE...

06:06.000 --> 06:07.333
COOPER...

06:07.375 --> 06:09.750
CHARLOTTE KING
IS STILL ALIVE, RIGHT?

06:09.792 --> 06:13.041
I'M JUST SAYING,
THE IMPULSE--WE ALL HAVE IT.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.542
HEY.
HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING HERE.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.959
UH, CAN I TALK TO YOU?
YEAH, SURE,
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.500
NOT YOU. YOU.

06:24.792 --> 06:28.917
(elevator bell dings)

06:28.959 --> 06:32.792
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT THE ELEVATOR? I...

06:32.834 --> 06:36.000
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.000
(knock on door)

06:38.041 --> 06:40.166
OH, YAY. MY DAY IS MADE.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.041
I NEED A FAVOR, MONTGOMERY.
OH, THAT'S RICH.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.875
YOU OPEN A PRACTICE
RIGHT UNDERNEATH US,

06:43.917 --> 06:46.375
AND YOU NEED A FAVOR FROM US?
I'M NOT COMING TO YOU
FROM PACIFIC WELLCARE.

06:46.417 --> 06:49.458
AS CHIEF AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE
YOU RETAIN SURGICAL PRIVILEGES,

06:49.500 --> 06:52.917
I'M HOPING WE CAN BE CIVIL.
WHAT IS IT?

06:52.959 --> 06:56.709
NO, DON'T ENGAGE.
BREATHE, COOPER.
I CAN BE CIVIL. WHAT IS IT?

07:00.667 --> 07:03.875
ALENA DeGRAY,
FULL-TERM PREGNANCY.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.959
EIGHT MONTHS AGO,
SHE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.041
DOCTORS DID EVERYTHING
THEY COULD, BUT...

07:09.083 --> 07:11.875
SHE'S COMATOSE.
AND IN AN EARLY LABOR.

07:11.917 --> 07:14.959
OKAY.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.625
UH, ALENA,
SHE JUST, UH, MOANED.

07:17.667 --> 07:20.709
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

07:20.750 --> 07:23.625
SHE HASN'T DONE THAT
SINCE RIGHT AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

07:23.667 --> 07:26.834
MOANING IS A GOOD SIGN THAT
SHE'S STARTING TO RESPOND.

07:26.875 --> 07:29.041
I THINK IT'S JUST
A SIGN OF LABOR.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.750
SEAN,
THE NEUROLOGIST TOLD YOU,

07:30.792 --> 07:32.625
SHE'S NONRESPONSIVE.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.458
SHE WANTS THIS BABY SO MUCH.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.458
WE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT

07:36.500 --> 07:39.041
THE DAY BEFORE
THE CAR ACCIDENT.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.333
I THINK IT WAS
THE HAPPIEST DAY OF HER LIFE.
THE BABY'S
IN A BREECH POSITION.

07:42.375 --> 07:45.667
OUR O.B. TRIED E.C.V. TO TRY
TO TURN THE BABY, BUT--
SHE'S DOWN TOO LOW.

07:45.709 --> 07:49.333
I NEED TO DO A C-SECTION.
YOU WANNA BOOK AN O.R.?

07:49.375 --> 07:51.375
NO. SHE NEEDS
TO GO THROUGH LABOR.

07:51.417 --> 07:54.583
SHE NEEDS TO DELIVER
THIS BABY HERSELF.
SEAN, SHE CAN'T.
THE BREECH POSITION

07:54.625 --> 07:56.792
PUTS THE BABY AT RISK
FOR A PROLAPSED CORD,

07:56.834 --> 07:59.375
WHICH WOULD CUT OFF
THE BABY'S OXYGEN SUPPLY.

07:59.417 --> 08:00.667
THE HEAD COULD GET TRAPPED,

08:00.709 --> 08:03.500
POTENTIALLY CAUSING
BRAIN INJURY OR WORSE.

08:03.542 --> 08:06.667
YEAH, A WOMAN IN KENTUCKY,
SITUATION JUST LIKE ALENA,

08:06.709 --> 08:09.041
HAVING THE BABY,
IT WOKE HER.

08:09.083 --> 08:12.542
ALENA NEEDS TO DELIVER THIS BABY
NATURALLY, ON HER OWN.

08:12.583 --> 08:15.041
SHE HAS TO.
ALENA IS GOING TO WAKE UP.

08:15.083 --> 08:17.250
AND WE'RE GONNA BE
A FAMILY AGAIN.

08:30.125 --> 08:33.083
HE IS GOING TO KILL
HIS OWN CHILD.
HE LOVES HER.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.083
HE SAT HERE EVERY DAY.
HE WANTS HER BACK.

08:35.125 --> 08:38.083
SHE'S NOT WAKING UP, CHARLOTTE.
"RIP VAN WINKLE'S" A FAIRY TALE.

08:38.125 --> 08:40.083
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE GOING SENTIMENTAL.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.125
HARDLY. JUST...
I FIND HIM TOUCHING.

08:42.166 --> 08:45.041
I NEED TO DO A C-SECTION.
I NEED TO GET THE BABY OUT NOW,

08:45.083 --> 08:47.417
OR BOTH MOM
AND BABY COULD DIE.
WE CAN'T MAKE HIM.

08:47.458 --> 08:50.834
WE CAN'T FORCE HIM
TO LET US CUT HER OPEN.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.583
LOOK, MAYBE IF YOU TALK TO HIM,
GET TO KNOW HIM.

08:53.625 --> 08:55.875
HE WARMS UP TO YOU, AND THEN
YOU HELP HIM UNDERSTAND--

08:55.917 --> 08:58.208
NO, THAT'S YOUR JOB, CHARLOTTE,
AS CHIEF OF STAFF.

08:58.250 --> 09:01.458
MY JOB AS CONSULT
IS TO GET THE BABY OUT.
I HAVE A PRACTICE
TO GET BACK TO.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.041
SO DO I.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.041
WE...

09:07.083 --> 09:10.041
HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
TO HELP THAT FAMILY.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.750
YES, WE DO.
I'LL PUT HER ON TERBUTALINE

09:12.792 --> 09:14.834
TO TEMPORARILY STOP
THE CONTRACTIONS,

09:14.875 --> 09:17.834
BUT THAT'LL ONLY GET YOU
THROUGH THE END OF THE DAY.
I'LL CONSULT LEGAL.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.375
SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY
WE CAN OVERRIDE THE FATHER

09:20.417 --> 09:22.375
AND DO THE "C"
WITHOUT CONSENT.
OKAY.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.041
OKAY.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.458
HE COULD'VE LEFT,
AND HE DIDN'T. WHY NOW?

09:28.500 --> 09:31.667
SHE WAS GONNA DIE IN WHAT,
IN SIX WEEKS, THREE MONTHS?

09:31.709 --> 09:34.667
YOU THINK AFTER YEARS AND YEARS
AND YEARS OF THIS MARRIAGE,

09:34.709 --> 09:36.166
HE WOULD SHOOT HER NOW?

09:36.208 --> 09:39.208
THEY HAD A VOLATILE
RELATIONSHIP, ALL RIGHT?

09:39.250 --> 09:42.208
NOW YOU MAY HAVE SEEN HIS SIDE,
BUT I SAW HERS.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.208
AND SHE...
SHE WAS NOT SUICIDAL.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.792
WELL,
DOUG WAS NOT HOMICIDAL.

09:45.834 --> 09:47.834
EXCEPT FOR THE GUN
IN HIS HAND.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.291
I... I DON'T THINK
IT WAS LIKE THAT.

09:50.333 --> 09:53.291
WELL, THE COPS ARE GONNA WANT
A STATEMENT FROM BOTH OF US,

09:53.333 --> 09:55.291
AND I'M GONNA TELL THE TRUTH.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.625
WELL, IF DOUG GIVES ME
PERMISSION TO TALK TO THEM,

09:58.667 --> 10:00.625
SO AM I.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.125
WELL, THE ACTUAL TRUTH

10:02.166 --> 10:04.792
OR THE TRUTH
THAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.208
(Naomi laughs) NO. NO.

10:10.250 --> 10:13.208
IT'S--NO, IT REALLY--
IT'S FANTASTIC.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.208
I'M SERIOUS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:15.250 --> 10:16.959
I LIKE HER, PETE.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.208
I WENT DOWN TO
THE VENICE FAMILY CLINIC TODAY

10:19.250 --> 10:21.333
TO OFFER MY SERVICES.

10:21.375 --> 10:24.125
TURNS OUT THEY HAVE
A HUGE OVERFLOW OF PATIENTS,

10:24.166 --> 10:26.291
BUT NOT ENOUGH EXAM ROOMS,
BUT WITH NAOMI'S HELP,

10:26.333 --> 10:28.291
WE FOUND SOME ROOM HERE.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.291
HE-HERE AT--
AT OCEANSIDE WELLNESS?

10:30.333 --> 10:32.166
YEAH, WHEN THE CLINIC
HAS TOO MANY PATIENTS,

10:32.208 --> 10:34.458
I'LL SEE 'EM HERE.
ADDISON'S ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT HOW,

10:34.500 --> 10:36.250
WITH CHARLOTTE'S PRACTICE
OPENING,

10:36.291 --> 10:38.291
WE NEED TO EXPAND
OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH

10:38.333 --> 10:41.875
AND RAISE OUR PROFILE.
MEG IS THE PERFECT LIAISON.

10:41.917 --> 10:43.875
PLUS, SHE'S WILLING
TO LET DELL SHADOW.

10:43.917 --> 10:46.041
OCEANSIDE WELLNESS GETS TO
GENERATE POSSIBLE FUTURE INCOME,

10:46.083 --> 10:48.875
AND I GET TO AVOID
GOING STIR CRAZY.

10:48.917 --> 10:51.333
EVERYONE WINS.
WELCOME ABOARD, MEG.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.542
THANK YOU.

10:54.583 --> 10:59.125
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE TO GO
FIND DELL AND GET SET UP.

10:59.166 --> 11:00.667
SEE YOU LATER?

11:00.709 --> 11:02.166
YEAH.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.542
(elevator bell dings)

11:09.667 --> 11:11.208
SORRY.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.291
IS IT ALWAYS THIS SLOW?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.875
ONLY WHEN SOMEONE STOPS IT.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.667
(bangs control panel)

11:27.709 --> 11:29.208
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:29.250 --> 11:31.375
YOU'RE NOT CLAUSTROPHOBIC,
ARE YOU?

11:31.417 --> 11:33.542
NO, JUST IMPATIENT
AND IN A BAD MOOD.

11:33.583 --> 11:36.041
ANYTHING I CAN DO?
(elevator motor starts)

11:36.083 --> 11:38.208
(chuckles)

11:38.250 --> 11:41.375
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD.
I'M A THERAPIST.

11:41.417 --> 11:44.041
AND TO BE HONEST,
I'M A BIT NERVOUS.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.250
INTERVIEWING FOR A NEW JOB,
YOU KNOW? SO...

11:46.291 --> 11:49.208
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR?
YES, YOU WORK THERE?

11:49.250 --> 11:51.959
UH, NO. I PUSHED 5,
REMEMBER?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.375
RIGHT.

11:53.417 --> 11:56.375
WELL, IF YOU NEED TO TALK,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO.

11:56.417 --> 11:59.500
YOU KNOW, I'M A SHRINK, TOO.
I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

12:01.291 --> 12:04.041
OH, I'M SHEL--

12:04.083 --> 12:06.417
I'M SHELDON WALLACE.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.208
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU NEED?

12:12.250 --> 12:14.291
UH, NO. THIS IS PERFECT.
BETTER THAN I'M USED TO.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.041
CAN I JUST SAY, DR. PORTER,
THAT, UM--
MEG, PLEASE.

12:17.083 --> 12:20.166
MEG, I-I JUST KNOW I'M GONNA
LEARN SO MUCH WORKING WITH YOU.
WELL, I BET YOU COULD
TEACH ME A FEW THINGS, TOO.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.625
CANDY STASH--
UNDER THE MICROWAVE.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.417
SEE?
THAT'S CRITICAL INFORMATION.

12:24.458 --> 12:27.709
(laughs)
WELL, DELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
OUR FIRST PATIENT TOGETHER

12:27.750 --> 12:30.041
IS RENEE OLSEN.
OKAY.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.083
(woman) MR. DOWNS?
(man) YES.

12:32.125 --> 12:34.083
RENEE OLSEN?

12:34.125 --> 12:35.291
YES.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.291
HI.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.750
HI.
I'M DELL PARKER.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.250
HI.
HI.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.250
UM, I WAS REFERRED
TO DR. PORTER

12:41.291 --> 12:44.291
FOR, UM...
(lowers voice) TERMINATION.

12:44.333 --> 12:46.834
I'M SORRY?
TERMINATION.

12:46.875 --> 12:49.208
ABORTION?

12:49.250 --> 12:52.458
IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T
WANT HER HERE. I JUST DON'T--
WANT HER HERE.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.041
SHE JUST DID IT.
SHE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME.
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.709
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WENT
BEHIND MY BACK. SHE JUST--
WENT BEHIND YOUR BACK.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.458
NO. STOP FINISHING
MY SENTENCES.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.709
YOU KNOW, SHE'S A GOOD DOCTOR.
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

13:01.750 --> 13:04.250
HEY, DID ANYBODY KNOW MEG
WAS GONNA BE DOING ABORTIONS?

13:04.291 --> 13:07.375
NO.
LOOK, I-I KNOW I'M NOT
A PARTNER IN THIS PRACTICE,

13:07.417 --> 13:10.041
AND YOU GUYS MIGHT ALL BE OKAY
WITH THIS, BUT I WANT TO GO

13:10.083 --> 13:12.041
ON THE RECORD
FOR SAYING THAT I'M NOT.
NOT OKAY WITH WHAT?

13:12.083 --> 13:15.083
MEG WORKING HERE.
OH, YEAH. NAI TOLD ME. PRO BONO
CLINIC. I THINK IT'S GREAT.

13:15.125 --> 13:18.333
SHE'S DOING ABORTIONS.
AND?

13:18.375 --> 13:20.917
WAIT, YOU MEN
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT?

13:20.959 --> 13:24.375
NO, NOT AS MEN. WE RESPECT
THE CHOICE, BUT I THINK--
I DON'T.

13:24.417 --> 13:27.166
UM, I'M NOT COMMENTING.
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.083
(Naomi)
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT?

13:29.125 --> 13:31.792
MEG'S DOING ABORTIONS HERE.
SHE'S WHAT?

13:31.834 --> 13:34.333
HEY. NICE DIGS YOU GOT
IN THOSE EXAM ROOMS.

13:34.375 --> 13:36.875
THEY'RE PALATIAL
COMPARED TO GRASS HUTS.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.500
WHAT?
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD US YOU WERE
GONNA BE DOING ABORTIONS.

13:39.542 --> 13:42.208
THAT'S ALL.
OKAY, EVERYBODY WITHOUT
A VAGINA, LEAVE THE ROOM

13:42.250 --> 13:44.250
UNLESS YOU WANT TO FIGHT
WITH ME.

13:47.417 --> 13:48.834
THIS IS A PROBLEM?

13:48.875 --> 13:51.041
NO.
I RUN A FERTILITY CLINIC.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.542
AND I'M IN THE BUSINESS OF
HELPING WOMEN TO GET PREGNANT,

13:53.583 --> 13:55.542
NOT--
WHOA. WAIT.
ABORTION IS LEGAL

13:55.583 --> 13:58.625
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
NAOMI.
ARE YOU AGAINST CHOICE?

13:58.667 --> 14:01.041
I AM NOT GONNA ARGUE
ROE v. WADE WITH YOU.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.583
I AM JUST SAYING,
THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN DONE HERE

14:03.625 --> 14:07.291
AND THEY SHOULD NEVER
BE DONE HERE.
IT'S A VALID MEDICAL PROCEDURE
FOR WOMEN IN NEED.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.000
(pager beeping)
NOT FOR ME,
AND NOT FOR THIS PRACTICE.

14:10.041 --> 14:12.750
I'M SORRY. UH...
I HAVE TO RUN.

14:12.792 --> 14:15.208
ADDISON.
I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH IT.

14:15.250 --> 14:19.917
WE SAID SHE COULD WORK HERE.
SHE CAN WORK HERE.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.041
(indistinct conversations)

14:28.083 --> 14:30.000
I'M READY FOR RENEE.

14:30.041 --> 14:31.208
SHE'S GONE.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.041
WHAT? WHERE?

14:33.083 --> 14:34.333
I DON'T KNOW WHERE.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.333
I JUST KNOW THAT
SHE'S NOT COMING BACK.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.041
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?
IS SHE OKAY?

14:39.083 --> 14:42.375
EXCEPT FOR THE PART ABOUT
HER PLANNING TO KILL HER BABY.
Y-YOU TALKED HER OUT OF IT?

14:42.417 --> 14:45.250
I JUST TOLD HER
WHAT I THOUGHT, OKAY?

14:45.291 --> 14:48.000
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.166
SEAN, I GOT A MESSAGE
THAT YOU'RE READY

14:55.208 --> 14:58.041
FOR ME TO DO THE C-SECTION.
I TOLD YOU NO.
I MEANT NO.

14:58.083 --> 15:01.500
WE WANT YOU TO DO
THE C-SECTION.
THESE ARE ALENA'S PARENTS.

15:01.542 --> 15:04.458
I CALLED THEM AFTER I HAD LEGAL
DO SOME CHECKING.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.166
TURNS OUT SEAN AND ALENA
ARE NOT MARRIED.

15:07.208 --> 15:11.083
HE HAS NO RIGHT TO
MAKE DECISIONS ON HER BEHALF.
WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED

15:11.125 --> 15:13.041
RIGHT AFTER WE FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE BABY.

15:13.083 --> 15:16.208
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE WE
DIDN'T... I AM STILL FAMILY.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.500
DON'T YOU THINK
WE WANT HER BACK?

15:18.542 --> 15:21.834
BUT SHE'S NOT WAKING UP.
IF YOU NEED TO DO A C-SECTION
TO HELP THE BABY, THEN DO IT.

15:21.875 --> 15:22.917
NO.

15:24.875 --> 15:27.041
THE PARENTS HAVE
THE LEGAL AUTHORITY.

15:27.083 --> 15:30.709
I WILL SCHEDULE A C-SECTION
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.542
OH.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.208
DELL SHAMED A YOUNG WOMAN
FOR WANTING AN ABORTION.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.208
YOU OFFERED ABORTIONS
TO PATIENTS

15:45.250 --> 15:47.417
WITHOUT CONSULTING
ANYONE ELSE.
I'M A DOCTOR.

15:47.458 --> 15:50.041
I DON'T NEED TO CONSULT
ANYONE ABOUT MY MEDICAL CARE.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.041
YOU'RE A DOCTOR WHO'S WORKING
WITH SIX OTHER DOCTORS

15:52.083 --> 15:53.834
WHO HAVE OPINIONS
ABOUT CASES

15:53.875 --> 15:56.083
AND ABOUT THE REPUTATION
OF THEIR PRACTICE.

15:56.125 --> 15:58.166
I--I'M SCREWING UP
YOUR REPUTATION?

15:58.208 --> 16:01.083
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
YOU COMPLETELY DISREGARDED
EVERYONE ELSE WHO WORKS HERE.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.917
SO, YES, THAT DOES REFLECT
ON ME. THIS IS MY DOMAIN.

16:04.959 --> 16:08.000
FINE. I'LL GO.

16:15.709 --> 16:18.709
(water running)

16:21.333 --> 16:23.041
IT'S OFF.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.041
BABY DADDY WENT TO COURT
TO GET AN INJUNCTION

16:25.083 --> 16:27.834
AS GUARDIAN OVER THE BABY.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.834
NOT GONNA BE ANY SURGERY,
NOT TODAY.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.375
WHAT? NO, THE PATIENT IS
PREPPED AND READY TO GO.

16:32.417 --> 16:35.291
DAMN IT. (sighs)
SO WHAT NEXT?

16:35.333 --> 16:37.291
I'LL SEE
IF I CAN CONVINCE A JUDGE

16:37.333 --> 16:39.834
TO GET OVER HERE
AND CLEAR THIS UP.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.041
YEAH, IF THE BABY LIVES
LONG ENOUGH.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.625
CAN I ASK YOU?

16:43.667 --> 16:45.041
WHAT?

16:45.083 --> 16:46.625
COOPER.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.291
YOU BETRAYED HIM, CHARLOTTE.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.500
SO HOW LONG IS HE GONNA
MAKE ME PAY FOR MY CRIME?

16:51.542 --> 16:54.417
HE'S ANGRY. I DON'T SEE THAT
ENDING ANYTIME SOON.

16:54.458 --> 16:57.041
YEAH. OKAY.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.125
YEAH.

16:58.166 --> 17:01.041
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.875
I AM NOT. I JUST...

17:03.917 --> 17:06.000
I AM NOT.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.583
THIS DOESN'T MAKE US FRIENDS.
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS, MONTGOMERY.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.041
DON'T GO GETTING ANY IDEAS.

17:12.083 --> 17:15.000
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF BEING FRIENDS WITH YOU.

17:17.417 --> 17:19.041
(sighs)

17:19.083 --> 17:21.041
THEY'RE SAYING
I MURDERED HER.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.125
I DIDN'T.
I HELPED END HER PAIN.

17:24.166 --> 17:27.041
SAM SAYS...
HE THINKS--

17:27.083 --> 17:30.041
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
SAM SAW HER, TWO WEEKS AGO?

17:30.083 --> 17:33.000
A-AND FOR WHAT,
MAYBE HALF AN HOUR?

17:33.041 --> 17:36.041
HE DIDN'T SEE HOW WALKING UP
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS

17:36.083 --> 17:38.041
GOT TO BE
MORE THAN SHE COULD TAKE.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.667
I DID.

17:39.709 --> 17:42.792
I HAD TO LISTEN TO HER MOAN
IN PAIN WHEN THE DRUGS WORE OFF

17:42.834 --> 17:44.709
AND PANIC
'CAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE

17:44.750 --> 17:46.709
SHE HAD DIED
FROM A NOSEBLEED.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.083
WELL, THERE WERE
OTHER OPTIONS, DOUG.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.083
I DID WHAT SHE WANTED.

17:51.125 --> 17:56.041
LOOK... I KNOW KAREN AND I
HAD A LOUSY MARRIAGE.

17:56.083 --> 18:00.917
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I LOVED HER BY THE END.

18:00.959 --> 18:04.041
BUT I DID CARE ABOUT HER.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.834
I JUST WISH
YOU HAD CALLED ME FIRST.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.291
WE COULD'VE TALKED ABOUT IT.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.875
MY LAWYER SAYS THEY'RE GOING
FOR FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.

18:12.917 --> 18:17.083
I CAN'T... DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE IN HERE?

18:17.125 --> 18:20.291
PLEASE. PLEASE HELP ME.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.875
I WAIVE ALL PRIVILEGE.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.083
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
JUST TELL THEM.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.041
TELL THE POLICE...

18:27.083 --> 18:30.542
TELL THEM
I DIDN'T MURDER HER.

18:32.375 --> 18:35.458
DR. TURNER, YOU KNOW ME.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.000
DO YOU THINK I MURDERED HER?

18:43.041 --> 18:44.250
(door opens)

18:44.291 --> 18:46.291
(keys jangle)

18:48.125 --> 18:49.542
(keys clatter)

18:49.583 --> 18:51.667
(sighs)

18:51.709 --> 18:53.917
MEG?

19:05.625 --> 19:08.792
HEY, IS IT TRUE THAT PETE
FOUND OUT THAT

19:08.834 --> 19:11.792
MEG WAS DOING ABORTIONS
AND ASKED HER TO LEAVE?
NOT EXACTLY.

19:11.834 --> 19:14.041
'CAUSE IF THAT IS TRUE,
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

19:14.083 --> 19:17.041
WHAT, PETE ASKING HER TO LEAVE,
OR DOING THE ABORTIONS?
PETE.

19:17.083 --> 19:20.041
OH.
WELL, DON'T TELL ME
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

19:20.083 --> 19:22.041
WITH MEG
DOING THE ABORTIONS.
NAOMI--

19:22.083 --> 19:25.959
WHAT? I SPEND ALL DAY EVERY DAY
TRYING TO HELP WOMEN MAKE BABIES

19:26.000 --> 19:29.041
WHO--WHO STOPPED BELIEVING
THAT THEY EVER COULD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS
SUCH AN ISSUE FOR YOU.

19:29.083 --> 19:32.041
I... WISH THAT I HAD KNOWN
A DOCTOR LIKE MEG

19:32.083 --> 19:35.250
OR A PLACE LIKE OUR PRACTICE
WHEN I NEEDED AN ABORTION.

19:38.125 --> 19:40.083
I HAD TWO.

19:40.125 --> 19:42.625
I HAD
A VERY... MISSPENT YOUTH.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.291
I MADE SOME MISTAKES.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.291
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL US.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.083
I WASN'T GOING TO,
BUT I'M NOT ASHAMED.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.041
I WAS.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.792
I HAD ONE.

19:52.834 --> 19:56.834
AND I WAS EMBARRASSED
AND SCARED.

19:56.875 --> 19:59.208
I WAS EVERYTHING
A WOMAN SHOULDN'T BE.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.041
WELL, I FERTILIZE EGGS
EVERY DAY,

20:03.083 --> 20:06.125
AND I BELIEVE THAT LIFE
BEGINS AT CONCEPTION.

20:06.166 --> 20:09.041
OH, SO WHAT, IT'S MURDER?
I BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.041
WELL, I BELIEVE THAT THINGS
AREN'T SO BLACK-AND-WHITE.

20:11.083 --> 20:14.041
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T DO WHAT I DO.
NO, I DEAL WITH
THE AFTERMATH.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.500
I DEAL WITH WOMEN WHO'VE HAD
CHILDREN WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE.
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.083
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:34.083 --> 20:36.166
I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
IN THE MOOD FOR A DRINK

20:36.208 --> 20:38.166
AFTER A HARD DAY
AT THE OFFICE.

20:38.208 --> 20:40.834
NO, THANKS.
COOPER--

20:40.875 --> 20:43.000
GET OUT FROM IN FRONT
OF MY DOOR.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.000
MOVE.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.417
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

20:58.458 --> 21:01.166
I'M SORRY.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.041
I'LL DO THE TIME.

21:03.083 --> 21:06.542
WHATEVER YOU WANT,
I'LL DO THE TIME.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.041
BUT I AM SORRY.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.917
JUST... GO HOME.

21:11.959 --> 21:14.458
(lock clicks)

21:23.083 --> 21:25.041
(sighs)

21:38.083 --> 21:40.125
(closes door)

21:40.166 --> 21:42.458
I NEEDED TIME...

21:42.500 --> 21:44.125
TO THINK.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.125
SO I THOUGHT
IN MY HOTEL ROOM

21:46.166 --> 21:49.750
WITH THE CRISP WHITE SHEETS
AND THE TRAVEL-SIZED TOILETRIES.

21:49.792 --> 21:51.917
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

21:51.959 --> 21:53.917
YOU HAVE TWO MODES--
OFF AND ON--

21:53.959 --> 21:55.792
AND WHEN YOU'RE OFF...

21:55.834 --> 21:57.709
PETER, YOU GET COLD.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.500
YOU'RE CLOSED,
YOU'RE SHUT DOWN.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.542
IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE PUNISHING ME

22:01.583 --> 22:03.542
FOR SOMETHING
THAT I DIDN'T DO.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.542
YOU NEVER
USED TO BE LIKE THIS.

22:05.583 --> 22:09.542
THE MAN I KNEW...
WE USED TO SHARE EVERYTHING.

22:12.083 --> 22:13.750
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

22:13.792 --> 22:16.792
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
BETWEEN THEN AND NOW?

22:18.834 --> 22:20.291
THE CLINIC IS GOOD.

22:20.333 --> 22:22.500
WHAT YOU DO FOR PEOPLE
IS GOOD.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.000
I OVERREACTED.

22:27.166 --> 22:29.041
COME BACK.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.250
GOOD MORNING.

22:40.291 --> 22:42.375
NOT SO GOOD.

22:42.417 --> 22:44.375
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
GONNA SUBPOENA

22:44.417 --> 22:46.542
KAREN'S MEDICAL RECORDS.
YOU OKAY?

22:46.583 --> 22:48.375
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.375
AND I-I CANNOT GET THE IMAGE

22:50.417 --> 22:53.125
OF DOUG WITH THAT GUN
IN HIS HAND OUT OF MY HEAD.

22:53.166 --> 22:56.041
SO THEN YOU DO THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT--
NO. I DON'T KNOW. NO.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.041
I JUST... I WISH THERE WAS
SOMEBODY I COULD TALK TO,

22:59.083 --> 23:01.417
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS ABOUT
THIS KIND OF THING.

23:01.458 --> 23:04.625
I'M KIND OF IN
UNCHARTED WATERS HERE.

23:04.667 --> 23:08.000
I THINK I KNOW
SOMEONE YOU COULD TALK TO.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.208
SIT DOWN.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.458
SORRY.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.458
I DON'T MEAN TO BOTHER YOU
WHILE YOU'RE RECOVERING.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.417
OH, PLEASE... BOTHER ME.

23:21.458 --> 23:24.291
SO, UH, DOUG ADAMS
KILLED HIS WIFE.

23:24.333 --> 23:28.166
HOW DO I KNOW IF IT'S MURDER
OR ASSISTED SUICIDE?

23:28.208 --> 23:30.166
DOUG HAS HAD NO DIFFICULTY
WITH IMPULSIVITY

23:30.208 --> 23:32.250
OR ANGER CONTROL
HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

23:32.291 --> 23:34.250
HE WAS SUBMISSIVE TO HIS WIFE.

23:34.291 --> 23:38.208
I'VE NEVER FOUND ANY INDICATION
THAT HE WAS REMOTELY VIOLENT.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.667
I-I-IN FACT,

23:39.709 --> 23:42.458
I-I WOULD BE HARD-PRESSED
TO CONCOCT A SCENARIO

23:42.500 --> 23:45.458
IN WHICH HE HAD THE TEMERITY
TO STRIKE OUT AGAINST HIS WIFE

23:45.500 --> 23:47.458
UNLESS SHE INSTRUCTED HIM.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.917
YOU DON'T THINK
HE GOT SCARED TO LEAVE

23:49.959 --> 23:51.917
AND TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT?

23:51.959 --> 23:54.917
KILLING KAREN WOULD NEVER BE
THE EASY WAY OUT FOR HIM.

23:54.959 --> 23:56.917
I... I-I JUST DON'T THINK

23:56.959 --> 24:00.041
DOUG MURDERED HIS WIFE
IN COLD BLOOD.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.041
IN ALL MY YEARS ON THE FORCE,

24:02.083 --> 24:05.041
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN
I'VE SEEN KILL THEMSELVES

24:05.083 --> 24:07.250
OR ASKED TO BE KILLED
WITH A GUN?

24:07.291 --> 24:09.291
NONE.

24:11.542 --> 24:14.542
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILD
IS TO HAVE A MOTHER.

24:14.583 --> 24:18.041
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILD
IS TO BE ALIVE.
I WILL NOT HEAR SHOUTING.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.959
YOU WANT ME TO DEFER THIS
TO THE COURTROOM?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.250
WE CAN PUT THE ATTORNEYS
TOGETHER

24:22.291 --> 24:25.458
AND HAVE THEM DRAG IT OUT
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.458
I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.
THE BABY'S IN IMMINENT DANGER.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.792
IF I DO NOTHING, IT COULD SUFFER
IRREVERSIBLE COMPLICATIONS.

24:31.834 --> 24:34.458
AND THE HOSPITAL'S POSITION?
YOU SUPPORT DR. MONTGOMERY?

24:34.500 --> 24:37.041
WE WANT TO GIVE ALENA
EVERY CHANCE.

24:37.083 --> 24:40.250
THAT SAID, JUDGE,
WE DON'T DISPUTE DR. MONTGOMERY.

24:40.291 --> 24:43.041
IT IS HER ONLY CHANCE.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.041
SEAN, ALENA IS OUR DAUGHTER.

24:45.083 --> 24:48.333
IF WE THOUGHT FOR ONE MINUTE
WE COULD HAVE HER BACK...

24:48.375 --> 24:50.333
(judge)
I HAVE TWO CHOICES, SEAN.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.542
I CAN RULE ON THIS,

24:52.583 --> 24:55.000
OR YOU CAN WITHDRAW
YOUR OBJECTION.

24:55.041 --> 24:57.542
I'D RATHER IT COME FROM YOU.

25:03.083 --> 25:04.583
(elevator bell dings)

25:06.625 --> 25:08.583
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE IN A HURRY.

25:08.625 --> 25:10.583
(pants) THANKS.

25:13.417 --> 25:16.291
LOOK, I'M--I'M SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

25:16.333 --> 25:19.166
AH, WE ALL HAVE BAD DAYS.
TODAY ANY BETTER?

25:19.208 --> 25:21.250
ACTUALLY, NO.

25:21.291 --> 25:24.000
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

25:24.041 --> 25:26.166
YEAH, IT'S COMPLICATED.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.000
TRANSFERENCE?

25:28.041 --> 25:29.875
PSYCHOSIS?

25:29.917 --> 25:31.792
I'M KIDDING.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.333
MURDER. OR MANSLAUGHTER.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.792
WOW. THAT'S... BIG.

25:36.834 --> 25:39.041
YOU MUST BE GOOD.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.250
YEAH. YOU'D THINK.

25:41.291 --> 25:45.375
YOU KNOW THE BEST WAY
TO CHEER YOURSELF UP?

25:45.417 --> 25:49.333
CHEER SOMEONE ELSE UP.
OH, IS... IS THAT
YOUR BRAND OF THERAPY?

25:49.375 --> 25:53.041
WHAT IS THAT, JUNG OR FREUD,
OR, UH, OR FORTUNE COOKIES?

25:53.083 --> 25:55.041
IT'S MARK TWAIN, ACTUALLY.

25:55.083 --> 25:57.291
YOU LIKE TWAIN?

25:57.333 --> 25:58.792
YEAH, I DO.

25:58.834 --> 26:01.375
YOU SEE? THERE YOU ARE.
YOU'VE CHEERED ME UP.

26:01.417 --> 26:05.583
PEOPLE WHO LIKE TWAIN
ALWAYS CHEER ME UP.

26:05.625 --> 26:08.375
DID YOU GET THE JOB?

26:08.417 --> 26:10.458
I GOT THE JOB.

26:16.417 --> 26:18.375
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT RENEE.

26:18.417 --> 26:19.917
I'M BUSY.

26:19.959 --> 26:22.583
DELL.
WE WORK REALLY HARD TO
CREATE BABIES HERE.

26:22.625 --> 26:26.000
WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF
BRINGING BABIES INTO THIS WORLD.

26:28.166 --> 26:30.208
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW YOU
VERY WELL.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.208
I CERTAINLY
DON'T KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH

26:32.250 --> 26:34.041
TO JUDGE YOU FOR THIS.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.125
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW RENEE
VERY WELL,

26:36.166 --> 26:38.125
YET YOU WERE QUICK
TO JUDGE HER.

26:38.166 --> 26:40.542
(sighs) WHAT--WHAT--
WAS SHE RAPED?

26:40.583 --> 26:43.542
WOULD IT MATTER IF SHE WAS?
WOULD THAT MAKE IT OKAY?

26:43.583 --> 26:45.917
I MEAN, DOES THAT MAKE HER
MORE OR LESS WORTHY?
(clears throat)

26:45.959 --> 26:47.667
WE DON'T GET TO KNOW WHY.

26:47.709 --> 26:50.041
THAT IS HER BUSINESS.
THAT'S HER CHOICE, DELL.

26:50.083 --> 26:53.083
THAT WOMAN AGONIZED
OVER A DIFFICULT CHOICE,

26:53.125 --> 26:55.041
MADE IT AND CAME IN HERE.

26:55.083 --> 26:57.041
I GUARANTEE YOU
SHE WAS ALREADY WORRIED

26:57.083 --> 26:59.041
ABOUT PEOPLE OUT THERE
JUDGING HER

26:59.083 --> 27:01.041
ONLY TO HAVE YOU
MAKE HER FEEL ASHAMED.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.250
BUT WE ARE
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS.

27:03.291 --> 27:05.709
IT IS PART OF OUR JOB
TO SUPPORT HER

27:05.750 --> 27:09.000
ONCE SHE HAS MADE
THE HARDEST CHOICE IMAGINABLE.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.000
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
DOWN HERE, SEAN.

27:18.041 --> 27:21.083
I KNOW. I...
LOOK, I JUST--I CAN'T...

27:21.125 --> 27:24.041
I MADE HER LAUGH.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.458
I MADE HER LAUGH,

27:25.500 --> 27:28.792
AND SHE LOOKED AWAY
FROM THE ROAD AND...

27:28.834 --> 27:31.083
I... I CAUSED IT.

27:31.125 --> 27:33.083
I WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER COMA.

27:33.125 --> 27:36.125
I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER STAYING LIKE THIS.

27:36.166 --> 27:38.333
PLEASE, I KNOW
WHAT THE JUDGE SAID...

27:38.375 --> 27:40.333
BUT...

27:40.375 --> 27:44.500
I-I NEED A MIRACLE HERE.

27:44.542 --> 27:47.041
I'M ASKING FOR A MIRACLE.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.208
YOU HAVE TO
STOP PUNISHING YOURSELF.

27:49.250 --> 27:53.041
SEAN, YOU DIDN'T MAKE
THAT ACCIDENT HAPPEN.

27:53.083 --> 27:55.041
AND YOU DON'T
MAKE MIRACLES HAPPEN.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.417
BUT I DO.

27:56.458 --> 27:58.417
I'M ABOUT TO GO IN THERE

27:58.458 --> 28:00.291
AND DELIVER YOUR MIRACLE,
SEAN.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.583
AND I KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T
THE PATH THAT YOU SOUGHT OUT

28:03.625 --> 28:06.583
OR THE ONE THAT YOU AND ALENA
SAW FOR YOURSELVES.

28:06.625 --> 28:09.583
BUT THIS IS YOUR BABY,
THE BABY THAT ALENA WANTED,

28:09.625 --> 28:12.375
AND THE ONE THAT SHE WOULD
WANT YOU TO RAISE.

28:12.417 --> 28:14.375
SO I'M GONNA GO IN THAT O.R.

28:14.417 --> 28:16.834
AND I'M GONNA
BRING OUT THAT MIRACLE.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.792
(keys jangle)

28:28.458 --> 28:31.041
DID YOU--DID YOU TALK
TO THE D.A.? WHAT DID HE SAY?

28:31.083 --> 28:33.208
YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T TALK TO HIM YET.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.250
I-I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU MORE.

28:35.291 --> 28:37.792
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU...

28:37.834 --> 28:39.208
HERE...

28:39.250 --> 28:41.667
THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU DID,

28:41.709 --> 28:43.709
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

28:45.542 --> 28:48.417
IT MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.041
IT WAS.

28:50.083 --> 28:53.041
TO DO THAT
TO SOMEONE YOU LOVED

28:53.083 --> 28:56.458
AND TO
HAVE HER ASK FOR THAT...

28:56.500 --> 29:00.041
FOR HER TO ASK YOU
TO USE A GUN...

29:00.083 --> 29:02.208
KAREN WANTED IT TO BE QUICK.

29:02.250 --> 29:04.208
SHE--SHE--SHE WAS AFRAID

29:04.250 --> 29:07.667
THAT--THAT SOMETHING ELSE
WOULDN'T WORK.

29:07.709 --> 29:09.667
SHE WAS JUST
IN SO MUCH PAIN AND--

29:09.709 --> 29:11.667
I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.667
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
HER PAIN, DOUG.

29:13.709 --> 29:16.709
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR PAIN?

29:16.750 --> 29:19.709
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOUR PAIN.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.875
DELL. COME HERE.

29:23.917 --> 29:26.250
(sighs)

29:26.291 --> 29:27.875
YOU'RE ANTIABORTION.

29:27.917 --> 29:30.125
I AM.

29:30.166 --> 29:32.125
YEAH, UNAPOLOGETICALLY.

29:32.166 --> 29:34.125
DO YOU THINK
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE

29:34.166 --> 29:36.125
WHY A WOMAN WOULD WANT
TO HAVE AN ABORTION,

29:36.166 --> 29:39.041
LIKE RAPE OR--
I THINK IT MATTERS
WHY IT BOTHERS YOU.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, IF--
IF YOU'RE AGAINST IT

29:41.500 --> 29:43.458
FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
OR--OR PERSONAL BELIEFS,

29:43.500 --> 29:45.458
THAT'S ONE THING.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.750
GOD OR--OR SOMETHING
IN YOUR SOUL IS--

29:47.792 --> 29:49.792
IS TRYING
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

29:49.834 --> 29:51.792
I... I REFUSED TO EVEN LEARN

29:51.834 --> 29:53.792
HOW TO PERFORM THE PROCEDURE
IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.

29:53.834 --> 29:57.458
I COULDN'T.
I JUST... I COULDN'T.

29:57.500 --> 30:01.500
BUT IF ABORTION BOTHERS YOU
FOR OTHER REASONS...

30:01.542 --> 30:03.041
WHAT?

30:03.083 --> 30:05.709
LOOK, I DON'T--I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE

30:05.750 --> 30:08.667
FOR SWAYING YOU
TO THE OTHER SIDE.
WHAT?

30:08.709 --> 30:09.583
(sighs)

30:09.625 --> 30:12.667
DID YOUR CHILD'S MOTHER,
UH...

30:12.709 --> 30:15.041
DID SHE CONSIDER
HAVING AN ABORTION?

30:18.083 --> 30:20.417
YOU TRIED TO TALK HER
INTO GETTING ONE.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.834
YEAH.

30:25.875 --> 30:28.917
AND NOW YOU LOOK INTO
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BEAUTIFUL FACE,

30:28.959 --> 30:30.625
AND YOU FEEL GUILTY.

30:32.250 --> 30:34.250
(whispers) IT'S JUST...

30:36.083 --> 30:37.792
WE WENT TO THE CLINIC,

30:37.834 --> 30:40.375
AND SHE WOULDN'T
GET OUT OF THE CAR,

30:40.417 --> 30:44.709
AND I YELLED AT HER.

30:44.750 --> 30:48.000
I YELLED AT HER, AND, UH,
YOU KNOW, NOW I JUST...

30:49.750 --> 30:53.125
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
I YELLED AT HER.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.458
THEN I THINK

30:58.500 --> 31:02.750
YOU ARE NOT AGAINST
A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE.

31:02.792 --> 31:06.709
YOU'RE JUST PUNISHING YOURSELF
FOR THE CHOICE YOU ALMOST MADE.

31:12.458 --> 31:14.250
I'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.250
YOU RELEASED HER.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.583
YOU GAVE HER EVERYTHING
SHE WANTED.

31:18.625 --> 31:22.583
SO YOU SHOULD FEEL LIKE
A WEIGHT HAS BEEN LIFTED.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.792
BUT YOU DON'T, DO YOU?

31:24.834 --> 31:27.792
IT'S HARD TO FEEL THAT WAY
WHEN I'M IN HERE.

31:27.834 --> 31:29.834
IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD--

31:29.875 --> 31:32.083
HER IN PAIN, YELLING AT YOU,

31:32.125 --> 31:35.500
WANTING YOU TO HELP HER.

31:35.542 --> 31:38.500
SHE MADE YOU FEEL AWFUL
EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE,

31:38.542 --> 31:41.041
SO YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT
THAT BY HELPING HER,

31:41.083 --> 31:43.250
THE PAIN WOULD GO AWAY.

31:43.291 --> 31:45.667
BUT IT HASN'T
