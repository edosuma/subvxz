You gotta forgive me for earlier.
I was all wrong about you.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.044

05:50.809 --> 05:52.811
Ow!

05:53.061 --> 05:55.063

05:55.480 --> 05:57.073
Hi.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.824
Hi. Thank you.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.536
You were so good.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.619
Whoo!

06:12.873 --> 06:14.500
That was so fun!

06:14.666 --> 06:16.464
Yeah, it was.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.926
Next time, can you get through
the chorus before you do your solo?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.385
Miss Thing, next time?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.642
Yeah. I have a lot more songs.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.225
Then you better get a lot more confident
and learn to sing them yourself.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.684
Slavery is over.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.724
Really? You're not gonna
sing any more?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.689
No.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.696
Assume the position. What?

06:40.025 --> 06:41.368
Whoop. Ha-ha.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.647
My babies.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.354
But I know y'all don't
love each other that much.

I'm not trying to heat the outside.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.580
Close it.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.286
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.712
Is she gone?

08:15.870 --> 08:18.919
Y'all heifers sneak out,
and I get fussed at?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.544
Laugh at... Laugh at that.
Is that funny?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.216
Peace be with you.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.132
And also with you.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.020
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:33.179 --> 08:39.027
You know, the Lord loves a church
full of happy, good-looking black folk.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.562
Amen!

08:40.729 --> 08:42.572
I know y'all
happy this morning, right?

08:42.731 --> 08:43.823
Yes!

08:43.982 --> 08:47.907
Ain't no frowns in
this church today, is there?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.702
No frowns, no clowns,
not in church.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.458
And look at the choir.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.914
- How y'all doing this morning?
- Good!

08:56.077 --> 08:58.375
Levi, there she go.
What? What?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.712
Seven Sundays, seven churches,
and $7 later, and I find her.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.548
- That light-skinned girl?
- There.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.678
Oh, man. Well, that's Tammy Anderson.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.386
Yeah, man, she is smoking hot.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.175
Tammy.
Two sisters. They all fine.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.093
They can all sing too.
Is that right?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.979
Sure, you're right.
But they mama crazy, though.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.019
Shh!

09:17.182 --> 09:19.776
Y'all know better.

09:19.934 --> 09:23.734
I know I can't sing,
but I can love to hear singing.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.149
- Yes!
- Right?

09:28.193 --> 09:31.618
I'll see you next week, right?
Okay. See you later.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.329
Excuse me. You was
at the Discovery a few weeks...

09:35.492 --> 09:36.960

Oh... Bible study's

09:45.335 --> 09:46.882
Yeah, it is.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.422
You know, you bad at this.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.974
Just act natural.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.139
Hi. My name's Stix.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.599
Sparkle.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.564
Sara.
Huh?

09:57.722 --> 10:01.147
Who is my baby talking to?
Nineteen ain't no baby no more, Emma.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.231
What? No need in eyeballing me.
I tells the truth.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.023
It's in my contract as your friend.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.988
I'm telling you,
you hold on too tight to that one,

10:10.151 --> 10:12.995
she'll be unmarried
and back on your doorstep like Sister.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.120
That's just temporary, okay?

10:16.282 --> 10:19.206
Well, New York just spit her
right on back out, huh?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.495
No.
You know what?

10:20.662 --> 10:23.336
<i>You worry about your daughter,
I'll worry about mine.</i>

10:23.498 --> 10:25.171
I'm just saying.
Yeah, what?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.710
- Mom, I need some money.
- What?

10:26.876 --> 10:29.675
They selling dinners in the basement,
and they going fast.

10:29.838 --> 10:30.885
Mom?
Don't do it.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.674
Mama, please.
Come with me.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.013
Now you stop.
See y'all later.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.018
Sparkle.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.732
Let's go.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.534
So I will see you
at Bible study, Sparkle?

10:51.734 --> 10:53.327
Maybe.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.883
<i>Another one of my white friends
came to me the other day and said,</i>

11:07.041 --> 11:09.715
<i>"Where's the best place
to hide something from a Negro</i>

11:09.878 --> 11:11.255
<i>and he'll never find it?"</i>

11:11.421 --> 11:13.640
<i>I told him, "A work boot."</i>

11:16.384 --> 11:18.182
Y'all know he talking about us, right?

11:18.344 --> 11:19.812
<i>People are always asking me...</i>

11:20.555 --> 11:22.148
Where is she?
I don't know.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.270
Ms. Anderson, where's the bathroom?
Down the hall, second door to the right.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.562
Second door.
Mm-hm.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.231
Thank you.
Yeah, second door.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.736
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Satin Struthers.
Let's give him a hand.</i>

11:33.902 --> 11:36.997
<i>Great job. Thanks for coming.
Isn't he funny?</i>

11:39.699 --> 11:40.746
There you are.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.457
Why you not in Bible study?

11:43.620 --> 11:45.122
Haven't you heard?

11:45.288 --> 11:48.508
I'm a heathen. Don't want to sit in there
and be a hypocrite.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.634
Well, we already
got something in common,

11:50.793 --> 11:54.388
because I only came
just so I could ask you out.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.094
The other door. To the right.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.729
Other door. Sorry.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.116
Oh, y'all like that, huh?

12:13.274 --> 12:16.323
Funky dance, huh? You like that.
You like that music? Funky, huh?

12:17.111 --> 12:18.954
It make you want to dance.
Come on.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.239
Get it, Mama.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.875
Uh-huh. Yeah, Mama gonna get it.
Mama gonna get it.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.627
And you will too.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.460
You keep dancing like that,
you'll bring home a baby you can't feed.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.170
Let's open our Bibles.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.461
Oh.

12:32.627 --> 12:36.097
The deal was color television
for an hour of Bible study.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.642
I lived up to my end,
now you live up to yours.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.729
So let's go to Psalms 10...

12:42.887 --> 12:46.312
Reverend Bryce called.
Says he need you to check the books.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.648
The numbers are not adding up.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.940
All right.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.241
What are you watching?

13:01.990 --> 13:04.869
Oh, I love this song.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.761
No, no. Too many hormones
unattended in here.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.763
Let's go. Get out. Come on.
Sister, turn that TV off.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.220
Thank you. Come on, let's go.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.851
- Bye, Sparkle.
- See you.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.059
Good night, Mama.
Good night, baby.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.098
Mm. It was just getting good.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.608
See you tonight, Sparkle.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.315
- Call you later.
- All right.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.820
See you next time.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.448
- Bye, Tammy.
- Bye, Tune.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.570
Well, good night.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.410
Good night.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.749
Why are all the cute ones
always so stupid?

13:52.498 --> 13:55.126
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

14:03.634 --> 14:06.012
All right, I'm going.

14:40.880 --> 14:45.681
♪ You bring out
The woman in me ♪

14:45.843 --> 14:50.815
♪ What can I say
That you can't see? ♪

14:50.973 --> 14:55.149
♪ I like the way we carry on ♪

14:55.311 --> 15:01.239

My feelings got me just reelin' ♪

15:01.401 --> 15:06.328

15:06.489 --> 15:10.084

Sweet love, mm ♪♪

15:22.255 --> 15:23.598
Please, don't stop.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.179
What are you still doing here?
That was beautiful.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.681
Mm.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.146
Wait, that's your song?
You wrote that?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.978
Only if you thought it was good.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.484
I thought it was phenomenal.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.895
Then I wrote it.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.564
So did you write that song
your sister sang

15:39.730 --> 15:42.199
at the Discovery a few weeks back?

15:43.192 --> 15:46.412
Yes, but she kind of made it her own.
Wait a minute.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.323
You wrote that song?

15:48.489 --> 15:50.537
You wrote the song you were singing?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.954
You wrote the songs in here too?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.168
Yes. Ahem.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.173
What you gonna do with the music?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.334
Why not? Nothing.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.846
Because my mother
would never let me.

16:04.005 --> 16:07.555
Plus, I'm not the singer in the family.
Sister is, then Dee.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.266
I sing in the choir
so I don't sit by myself in church.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.772
No offense,
but I'm just hearing excuses.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.603
Excuse me?
I don't mean to be rude.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.769
I'm just passionate,
especially when it comes down to music.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.688
That's why I'm here.
I'm staying with my cousin, Levi.

16:20.855 --> 16:24.155
I'm from Kansas City.
We got a cool jazz scene down there.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.742
I managed a few acts,
but the money's here in Motown.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.998
And I want to be...
I am the next Berry Gordy.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.705
I figure, his stomach ain't
growling like mine any more.

16:32.867 --> 16:35.120
Maybe he's leaving a lot
of steak and potatoes out there.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.795
You mind if I hear that song again?

16:41.209 --> 16:43.962
Mm. Still needs a lot of work.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.483
Why won't you unpack?

17:01.646 --> 17:03.648
I really don't plan on
being here that long.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.907
You said that two months ago.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.406
Sorry.

17:12.531 --> 17:16.377
Hey, don't ever be sorry
for telling the truth, Spark.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.830
What was that?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.300
Your Romeo is out there.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.340
What?
Mm-hm.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.449
You can't be throwing rocks
at my window.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.779
My mother has a gun.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.620
A gun. A big one.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.781
There's an underground club tonight.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.042
The kind that songwriters
don't want to miss.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.747
You got to hear the music.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.288
It's the stuff they ain't playing
on the radio.

18:00.454 --> 18:04.004
Come with me.
He wants me to go hear music with him.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.471
You've snuck out
of the house for less.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.757
And I know just the dress.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.222
You coming?

18:57.928 --> 18:59.851
I ain't gonna bite you.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.142
And how do I know that?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.611
You're gonna have to trust me.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.605
Can I tell you something?

19:41.764 --> 19:44.438
I think your lyrics are too safe.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.570
I mean, you got Dr. King, the war.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.985
I don't think the metaphorical lyrics
gonna fly any more.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.823
What?
You impressed by my big word?

19:54.985 --> 19:57.158
I was.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.542
In the spirit of telling the truth,
can I tell you another?

20:01.701 --> 20:04.705
I wouldn't want you to lie.
Then why do you lie to yourself?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.791
About not wanting to sing?

20:09.333 --> 20:11.256
I mean, Sparkle,
you writing these songs.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.342
And you can sing.

20:14.296 --> 20:18.301
So why aren't you singing them?
I'm no Diana or Aretha.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.687
You know, you right.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.848
You Sparkle.

20:25.266 --> 20:29.191
Look, my mom
used to sing professionally.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.698
She tried to break out
and it almost killed her.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.031
So thank you, but I know
the realities of this business.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.867
I'm just doing it for fun.
You know the realities?

20:39.029 --> 20:41.123
Oh, stop.
I'm...

20:41.866 --> 20:43.288
Listen.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.749
What are you afraid of?

20:45.911 --> 20:47.288
Your mom or your own voice?

20:48.789 --> 20:51.338
Maybe you'd be like your mom
and never reach your goals.

20:52.209 --> 20:55.338
But don't fall short of it
because you can't admit that you want it.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.594
Okay.

21:00.301 --> 21:03.054
I want to be better than Diana.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.602
I want to be a star.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.693
Thank you.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.656
I had a great time tonight.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.245
And just in case
I never get out of that house,

21:24.408 --> 21:26.376
thank you for making me
tell the truth.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.473
Sparkle,

21:45.513 --> 21:47.186
do you want to be a star?

21:47.807 --> 21:49.559
What?

21:49.725 --> 21:53.025
Do you want to be a star?
Yes, I want to be a star.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.485
No, I don't believe you.
Say it like you mean it.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.616
Yes, I want to be a star.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.527
Okay.

21:59.693 --> 22:02.367
First you have to
write a song for your sister,

22:02.530 --> 22:04.532
something where she
can work the crowd.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.372
Sparkle, you gonna have to get
over your fear of singing

22:07.535 --> 22:09.412
because you and Dee
gonna back her up.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.706
I mean, everybody loves
a good girl group.

22:11.872 --> 22:15.046
Now, you tweak your lyrics,
make them more raw, more relatable.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.802
But Fillmore, here we come.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.089
Of course, you gonna
have to win Cliff Bells.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.805
You have to be invited to compete.
Yeah, I know. I'm gonna work on that.

22:22.967 --> 22:26.471
Now, I want you to work on your sisters,
and I'll work on Cliff Bells.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.311
And you'll be our manager?
Of course.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.726
Then you manage to get my sisters.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.024
Do I have you?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.860
Backup, remember?

22:38.023 --> 22:39.946
Good night.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.618
Cliff Bells? Come on.
I'm not embarrassing myself.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.876
- Didn't Marvin Gaye get booed there?
- Yeah, but it made him better.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.911
Now he's traveling, making millions.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.955
Mr. Gordy is making millions.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.968
However it may be, it was enough
to get him out of his mama's house.

22:57.835 --> 23:00.008
You don't have to be rude about it.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.798
Well, I don't really know
if you were asking me.

23:02.965 --> 23:06.640
You never really looked my way, so our
eyes never got to dance, but I'm in.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.975
And just to be clear,
I'm in it for the money.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.733
Medical school is expensive, so, no,
you won't get 20 percent. Fifteen max.

23:12.892 --> 23:16.362
And once I get accepted into medical
school you will have to replace me.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.239
And if you pretend
like I don't exist going forward,

23:19.398 --> 23:21.992
I will turn my sisters against you.

23:22.151 --> 23:26.247
Other than that,
sounds like fun. Hmm.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.624
I'll wait for you guys outside.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.630
I'll let you know.
My first day at Freeman's is tomorrow.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.170
Working at a department store?

23:42.004 --> 23:45.554
Heh. You ain't gonna
make no money. Sparkle!

23:47.301 --> 23:48.348
Come on, Sparkle.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.808
Everything I said the other night,
I believe.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.188
You used me to get to Sister.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.693
You said it yourself,
Sister is the better performer.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.317
Sparkle.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.033
<i>Have you lost faith
in Mr. Johnson?</i>

24:07.196 --> 24:10.120
<i>Well, I guess the president
would have to answer that question.</i>

24:10.282 --> 24:12.831
Oh, who doesn't like Sidney Poitier?

24:12.993 --> 24:15.963
But the movie, you liked the movie?
Yeah, I loved the movie.

24:16.121 --> 24:20.342
More importantly, the next time you
take me out, you need to have a car.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.548
Oh, I'm just...

24:21.710 --> 24:24.338
I'm just waiting
on the right one to buy, baby.

24:24.505 --> 24:27.725
Take me on a date on a bus
in the rain?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.345
You're lucky I like you.

24:35.766 --> 24:39.896
Look, I don't know any other way to be
than myself. I'm a straight shooter.

24:40.062 --> 24:43.032
So here we go.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.237
I like you too.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.573
I do, and I want to be your man.

24:49.196 --> 24:53.121
I'm serious. I ain't like all the other
jive guys that just want to do you.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.536
I heard about your reputation.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.296
I just think it's what guys say

24:57.454 --> 25:00.549
when they see something beautiful
and know they can't have it.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.554
So they'd rather tear it down
than make it something they want.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.801
But I see your beauty.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.933
Outside and inside.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.435
I want to earn it.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.645
Kind of like a job.

25:18.434 --> 25:22.405
Yeah, so just tell me what you need
to fall in love with me.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.816
Because whatever it is, I'll do it, girl.

25:24.982 --> 25:29.863
Whether you believe it or not,
I'm already in love with you.

25:33.657 --> 25:37.287
I already heard it so much,
it all sounds like BS to me.

25:37.453 --> 25:40.252
Maybe I better roll up
my sleeves then, huh?

25:40.414 --> 25:43.793
Hopefully not as high as your pants.
What's wrong with my pants, girl?

25:43.959 --> 25:46.587
This is the style. You can see my socks.
Change it.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.427
Put some sugar in them shoes.

25:48.589 --> 25:52.059
So I can sweet-talk
my pants down, huh?

25:58.348 --> 26:00.225
What's this?

26:02.478 --> 26:04.697
Open it up.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.864
Oh, Levi.

26:10.027 --> 26:12.951
I swear,
one day that's gonna be yours.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.160
I promise you.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.538
That's Satin Struthers.

26:20.704 --> 26:24.550
Now that's some of the coolest trolling
I done seen in a long time.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.254
Did you see this cat, Ham?
Yeah, I see him.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.468
What's your name, brother?

26:30.631 --> 26:32.178
Levison, but they call me Levi.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.475
Levi, here I am buying the real deal
for these women,

26:36.637 --> 26:39.481
and you tell me
you cut a picture out of a magazine

26:39.640 --> 26:41.608
and just put it in a box?

26:41.767 --> 26:43.610
I'm about to go get me
some scissors,

26:43.769 --> 26:47.114
and cut some pictures out of magazines
like your boy Levi right here.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.910
Clip-clip, hussies.
Clip-clip, hussies.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.666
Can I see it? Let me see that.

26:58.659 --> 26:59.706
This is nice.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.870
Ooh. This is nice.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.667
You got a good man here.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.509
Yep.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.929
Yeah, I used to eat in here
back in the day,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.602
ahem, when I was struggling.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.138
This is some real cheap,
good food.

27:19.304 --> 27:23.184
But I'm not gonna hold you guys.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.145
Have a good night.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.236
Levi.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.447
Satin.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.363
Did you see her?
You were so wrong.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.960
Tammy, I should get you home.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.745
Sure.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.114
Mama was so pretty.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.774
Oh, here's Dee's daddy.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.944
Here's a good one of
yours and Sister's daddy.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.238
Cute, but no good.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.577
You got to watch out
for those cute ones, baby.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.742
They make a lot of promises.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.786
My goodness. Look it here.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.705
Gonna be the first store
in Detroit to have one of these.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.170
Mm. She's pretty, Mama.
Oh, a chocolate mannequin.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.755
Ain't it something?

28:30.918 --> 28:33.467
Dr. King said
we would have integration.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.256
- That's right.
- Look what I found.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.800
What's that?
The other, nicer you.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.095
Sparkle, you go to lunch.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.265
You come with me and let me try
to fit your behind in this dress.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.141
Oh. See how she do me?
Come on.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.231
She used to be real nice, girl.

28:48.936 --> 28:51.780
She's in there somewhere.
Come on out, nice girl.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.657
See you later.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.038
I got Cliff Bells.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.728
Got my first check.

30:04.886 --> 30:05.978
Well, let me see.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.398
Ninety-six dollars?

30:11.560 --> 30:16.066
For two weeks of standing on your feet
and kissing rich white women's butts?

30:16.231 --> 30:18.609
I am never gonna get out of here.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.531
Stix said we can make
anywhere from 500 to $1000,

30:23.697 --> 30:26.416
if we win Cliff Bells' talent contest.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.374
Don't say it all dry like that. Sell it.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.414
So y'all talking to Stix now?

30:32.581 --> 30:36.131
No. She was talking to Stix, I was
talking to her, now we're talking to you.

30:39.004 --> 30:42.725
You sure you want to do this?
Yes.

30:42.883 --> 30:45.352
You know, they say
you shouldn't eat where you...

30:45.510 --> 30:47.729
Mm-mm. It's the other way around.
She gets the point.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.061
You guys, I thought about it,

30:50.223 --> 30:54.524
and I want to do this for me,
not for him.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.152
So how much
we gonna make a week?

31:04.112 --> 31:05.534

More money? Better clothes?

42:54.989 --> 42:56.957

Sparkle, those who do, do, baby.

44:16.904 --> 44:18.781
Pastor, thank you.

44:18.948 --> 44:20.746
Please, bow our heads.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.376
Our Father in heaven,

44:22.535 --> 44:25.709
for this meal you have given,
we want to say thank you.

44:26.247 --> 44:29.342
And, mm,
bless the ones who prepared it.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.629
And, Lord, as we share it,
will you stay with us,

44:32.795 --> 44:34.172
and be our guest of honor?

44:34.338 --> 44:38.218
But not just at this meal,
but God in our waking,

44:38.384 --> 44:41.809
God in our speaking,
God in our playing,

44:41.971 --> 44:43.564
God in our digesting,

44:43.723 --> 44:47.728
God in our working,
God in our resting.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.896
In a world where so many are lonely,

44:50.062 --> 44:54.158
may we share this friendship
with joyful hearts.

44:54.317 --> 44:59.414
Amen.
May this food, so fresh and fragrant,

44:59.572 --> 45:03.452
call forth reverence for you
in our souls.

45:03.618 --> 45:06.963
As you give this strength
to our perishable limbs,

45:07.121 --> 45:10.216
so give us grace
for our immortal lives.

45:10.374 --> 45:14.049
And let's not forget the blessings
on this family, Father God.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.682
Lord, we thank you. Amen.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.012
Amen!

45:19.175 --> 45:21.894
Now, that's why black folks
can't get ahead, right there.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.771
Not because we lazy.

45:23.930 --> 45:26.900
It's because we're too busy praying
over 40 acres and a mule.

45:27.058 --> 45:29.106
Now, by the time
black folks get to "amen,"

45:29.268 --> 45:31.270
the mule is dog food,

45:31.437 --> 45:35.032
and the 40 acres is sold
from underneath us.

45:35.191 --> 45:36.613
Because we too busy praying.

45:38.986 --> 45:41.614
Mom, this is Satin.

45:42.448 --> 45:45.247
Pleasure.
Pleasure is mine, all mine.

45:50.623 --> 45:52.717
Two dollars say
he doesn't make it to dessert.

45:52.875 --> 45:55.799
Five says he doesn't get
food on his plate. Look at Mama's face.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.381
- This is Mrs. Waters.
- Pleasure.

45:58.547 --> 46:00.220
- And Tune Ann.
- Hey, Tune Ann.

46:01.008 --> 46:02.055
- My sisters.
- Hey.

46:02.218 --> 46:04.641
And this is the Reverend Bryce.
Mm-hm.

46:04.804 --> 46:07.023
What do you say, Rev?
Mm-hm.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.478
Satin Struthers.

46:08.641 --> 46:11.360
Yeah, yeah, I seen you on TV.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.568
You were pretty hard
on the folk in Detroit after the riots.

46:15.648 --> 46:19.152
Well, I was telling the truth, you know.
It shows a lack of intelligence

46:19.318 --> 46:21.491
for someone to loot
their own neighborhood.

46:21.654 --> 46:22.951
Well, people were angry.

46:23.114 --> 46:24.991
At white people. Heh.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.626
Hell, go tear up they shit.
What...?

46:27.910 --> 46:31.255
Ahem. Definitely
not making it to dessert.

46:31.414 --> 46:34.463
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hail Mary.

46:35.668 --> 46:36.715
That's Catholic.

46:37.295 --> 46:38.672
It's still Christian, right?

46:39.171 --> 46:42.516
I mean, come on.
I understand, I understand.

46:42.675 --> 46:46.054
I was trying to get black people
to see it from a different perspective.

46:46.220 --> 46:49.474
Burning and looting your own
neighborhood may be misguided,

46:50.182 --> 46:54.062
but at least those people out there were
trying to fight to change the system.

46:54.228 --> 46:56.026
Now, with all due respect,

46:56.188 --> 46:59.943
you just trying to
make a dollar off their pain.

47:01.360 --> 47:05.365
I bet you know a little bit more about
making dollars off of people's pain.

47:05.531 --> 47:07.408
You packing them
into church every Sunday.

47:07.575 --> 47:10.374
Giving them a show,
got them hooting and hollering. Yeah.

47:10.536 --> 47:11.583
You know what, Rev?

47:11.746 --> 47:13.794
The only difference
between me and you,

47:13.956 --> 47:17.005
is you collect your fee at the pew,

47:17.168 --> 47:19.170
I collect mine at the door.

47:27.887 --> 47:30.060
Well, Ms. Anderson,

47:31.349 --> 47:34.068
I guess now is a good time
for me to let you know

47:34.226 --> 47:37.571
that I asked your daughter
to marry me.

47:39.732 --> 47:41.405
Surprise.

47:42.318 --> 47:43.661
He asked me last night.

47:43.819 --> 47:47.699
Got down on one knee and told me
that he couldn't live without me.

47:47.865 --> 47:52.917
Sister, you're going to marry this man?

47:53.079 --> 47:57.676
He disrespects our home,
the reverend.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.757
Oh, he's a comedian.
He was just trying to make us laugh.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.673
He's a really good man.

48:03.839 --> 48:05.841
Even goes to church sometimes. Heh.

48:06.008 --> 48:09.763
Granted, it is for material,
but I am there,

48:09.929 --> 48:11.431
and God knows my heart.
- Stop.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.224
I got a good heart.
Stop.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.393
He tithes.

48:18.479 --> 48:21.449
Child, I think enough of you
to introduce you

48:21.607 --> 48:25.453
to dentists and doctors
and accountants.

48:25.611 --> 48:28.410
But, no, not you.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.119
You want to whore with this coon.

48:30.282 --> 48:32.205
Mom!
Sparkle.

48:36.080 --> 48:40.586
Um, Ms. Anderson,
I'm probably more of a Sambo.

48:43.212 --> 48:48.389
I coon from time to time,
but Sambo's my go-to.

48:50.719 --> 48:54.519
Baby, think more of yourself.

48:54.682 --> 48:59.984
I know you're worried about getting older
and who's gonna marry you.

49:00.146 --> 49:01.864
But get older, not desperate!

49:02.022 --> 49:04.445
Desperate? Heh.

49:05.317 --> 49:07.661
I'm doing a whole lot better
than you ever did.

49:08.529 --> 49:11.453
Just keeping a man
is a whole lot better than you ever did.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.993
- Ladies, please. I think.
- No, no, no, Reverend.

49:14.160 --> 49:16.629
Let her get her attention.
She doesn't have much else.

49:17.121 --> 49:20.921
Maybe this is a conversation...
Me getting a husband is not about me.

49:21.083 --> 49:24.804
It's about her. It's not my fault
that she got knocked up at 16,

49:25.045 --> 49:27.969
and is trying to convince folks
she's the perfect mother,

49:28.132 --> 49:31.682
raised some good girls.
Sparkie's gonna follow up behind you,

49:31.844 --> 49:34.848
and be a little church mouse
and make dresses.

49:35.014 --> 49:37.267
And if she's lucky,
she'll be a preacher's wife.

49:37.433 --> 49:41.563
Dee's gonna be a doctor,
and I'm just supposed to marry one?

49:41.729 --> 49:44.403
Funny thing is,
maybe I could have snagged one,

49:44.565 --> 49:46.818
if you'd sent me to school
like these two.

49:46.984 --> 49:49.988
But instead, I was at home,
raising your kids,

49:50.154 --> 49:52.156
while you were laid up
in your own vomit.

49:52.323 --> 49:54.166
Sister,

49:54.325 --> 49:56.953
if you gonna tell my tragic story,

49:57.119 --> 50:00.123
give me the honor
of getting it correct.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.299
Yeah, I passed out a few times.

50:02.458 --> 50:05.086
Sure, I've had my moments.

50:05.252 --> 50:11.760
But you've never, ever, ever
seen me laying in my own vomit.

50:12.176 --> 50:13.553
Whatever you say, Mama.

50:15.095 --> 50:19.942
The fact is, I was desperate back then.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.398
Right now,
I'm trying to get myself out of here,

50:22.561 --> 50:25.565
and get myself more than
a color TV and half a room.

50:25.731 --> 50:27.028
It's okay.

50:35.407 --> 50:37.501
Well, we better go.

50:37.660 --> 50:41.710
Ms. Anderson, thanks for what looked
like could have been a great dinner.

50:44.291 --> 50:45.338
We better go.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.677
Sister!

50:50.839 --> 50:55.595
You leave my house,
there's no coming back.

50:56.679 --> 50:57.896
Not this time.

51:08.941 --> 51:12.411
Sparkle. Sparkle!

51:20.995 --> 51:23.168
Are you still gonna be
part of the group?

51:24.456 --> 51:28.461
That's not exactly
what was on my mind, Spark.

51:28.627 --> 51:30.504
Yeah, sure.

51:40.055 --> 51:42.103
Dee, say something.

51:45.477 --> 51:46.569
Congratulations.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.982
Thank you.

51:51.525 --> 51:52.572
Thank you.

51:57.197 --> 51:59.074
Come here.

52:01.243 --> 52:02.586
I love you, Spark.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.629
It's okay.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.928
Where you want to go?

53:00.094 --> 53:01.812
Anywhere.

53:24.159 --> 53:26.332
Close your eyes.

53:35.170 --> 53:38.970
Okay, you can open them.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.512
Your cup of coffee, sir.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.441
I appreciate it, baby.

53:47.599 --> 53:51.320
You know, Daddy got to wake up
a little faster and a little stronger.

53:51.478 --> 53:55.483
You'll be surprised with
what this gonna do when we make love.

53:57.818 --> 54:01.243
Can't be any better than it already is.

54:24.303 --> 54:26.476
Are you catching a cold?
No, I'm fine.

54:26.638 --> 54:28.891
Okay, from "You bring out

cab fare for them?

Aretha Franklin.

No.
Satin.

Well, you should.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.824

55:36.708 --> 55:39.086
Oh, my God, Ms. Franklin!

55:39.253 --> 55:40.300
Hello.

55:40.462 --> 55:43.056
Today ain't the day
to be fashionably late.

55:43.215 --> 55:44.262
You're fine.

55:44.424 --> 55:46.802
Stix says Ms. Franklin's not here.
Running late.

55:47.302 --> 55:50.306
I'm worried because that's gonna
cut it close to us getting home.

55:50.472 --> 55:51.689
Sure is.

55:52.432 --> 55:54.150
Do you have any more pins?

55:54.309 --> 55:57.313
I'm running out of mine over here
and I need some more.

55:57.479 --> 55:59.732
I can't get this thing on.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.451
What happened to your face?

56:02.609 --> 56:04.737
Oh, it ain't nothing.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.530
He did that to you, didn't he?

56:06.697 --> 56:08.324
I had an accident.

56:08.490 --> 56:10.584
Oh, so, what,
you tripped and hit his fist?

56:10.742 --> 56:11.994
Get out.

56:12.744 --> 56:13.791
Excuse me?

56:14.538 --> 56:16.586
I told you to get out of my face.

56:16.748 --> 56:19.092
He's beating you,
and you're taking it out on me?

56:19.251 --> 56:22.050
Just go. Go! Get out!
No!

56:22.212 --> 56:24.385
I don't need to hear this. Huh?

56:25.549 --> 56:28.223
Jeez, she's always in my business!
Somebody ought to be!

56:28.385 --> 56:31.138
Shut up.
You guys, stop. Don't do this!

56:31.305 --> 56:32.477
Not tonight.

Something he can feel ♪♪

01:00:47.472 --> 01:00:50.567
- Just amazing.
- I know. They're special.

01:00:51.267 --> 01:00:53.941
Ladies, we have a special guest.

01:00:54.104 --> 01:00:56.778
This is Mr. Larry Robinson
of Columbia Records.

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:57.987
Hi.
Hi.

01:00:58.149 --> 01:01:01.619
Oh, listen to that.
They even say "hi" in harmony.

01:01:01.778 --> 01:01:05.157
Mr. Robinson is senior A&R
at Columbia in Los Angeles.

01:01:05.323 --> 01:01:07.951
He set up an office here
because he's looking for talent.

01:01:08.118 --> 01:01:11.372
He wants to talk to us about a...
Excuse me, may I share?

01:01:11.538 --> 01:01:12.881
Sure.
Could this be my news?

01:01:13.039 --> 01:01:14.962
By all means.
Great.

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:17.844
First off, you were fantastic.

01:01:18.002 --> 01:01:19.219
Fantastic!

01:01:19.379 --> 01:01:21.632
Thanks.
I want to sign you.

01:01:21.798 --> 01:01:23.425
I'm going to sign you.

01:01:23.591 --> 01:01:26.765
I just need to, you know,
see what you're gonna look like

01:01:26.928 --> 01:01:31.149
waking up next to me in the morning.
Stix, what is this?

01:01:31.307 --> 01:01:33.059
You know, that was an expression.

01:01:33.226 --> 01:01:36.275
Okay.
And it's more like,

01:01:36.437 --> 01:01:39.065
I want to see you in the light of day.

01:01:39.232 --> 01:01:41.655
That's a better expression.
Way better.

01:01:41.818 --> 01:01:45.072
I'm gonna gather
a bunch of my colleagues together,

01:01:45.238 --> 01:01:49.084
and you will wow us.

01:01:49.242 --> 01:01:51.370
And, you know, this is your fault.

01:01:51.536 --> 01:01:52.788
It is your fault.

01:01:52.954 --> 01:01:55.423
I don't even know
if you guys can actually sing.

01:01:55.582 --> 01:01:57.505
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.920
Look at that, she's playing coy.

01:02:00.086 --> 01:02:02.088
This is the coy one.

01:02:02.255 --> 01:02:06.305
Well, that's all right.
Coy plays on any number of levels.

01:02:06.467 --> 01:02:08.219
So great.

01:02:08.386 --> 01:02:10.605
Well, see you next week.

01:02:10.763 --> 01:02:12.140
- Bye.
- Thank you.

01:02:12.307 --> 01:02:16.437
Y'all wowed him!
Look. You got a line coming in here, girls.

01:02:17.979 --> 01:02:19.231
Wow.

01:02:19.397 --> 01:02:20.444
Satin.

01:02:20.607 --> 01:02:21.904
Stix.

01:02:22.066 --> 01:02:24.569
Huh. You been fighting?

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:26.947
No, I got a new cat.
Ah.

01:02:27.113 --> 01:02:29.536
Yeah, yeah, cat.
That's a big-ass cat.

01:02:29.699 --> 01:02:31.997
Sure is.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.630
Ladies, you better get out of here.
Called the cab, it's waiting out front.

01:02:36.664 --> 01:02:39.383
I saw you singing to me, teasing me.

01:02:40.585 --> 01:02:43.213
Y'all wowed them. And I got to run.

01:02:43.379 --> 01:02:45.848
See if I can talk to Mr. Gordy,
get us a bidding war.

01:02:46.007 --> 01:02:47.008
That's right.

01:02:47.175 --> 01:02:49.519
Satin.
Stix.

01:02:54.849 --> 01:02:56.726
Let's go, baby. You ready to go?

01:03:01.272 --> 01:03:02.569
Y'all her new bodyguards?

01:03:03.233 --> 01:03:05.531
We're big-ass cats.
Hmm.

01:03:21.292 --> 01:03:24.091
Come on, let's go.
Mama would let you back into the house.

01:03:24.796 --> 01:03:27.925
You guys, really, I fell.
You said Mom used to fall a lot too.

01:03:28.091 --> 01:03:32.312
You even picked her up a few times.
It was only one time.

01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:34.268
Too many.

01:03:34.722 --> 01:03:36.099
Sister, come home with us.

01:03:38.059 --> 01:03:39.185
Let's go.

01:03:40.019 --> 01:03:41.692

I'm sorry too.

Was my life not enough
of a cautionary tale for you?

01:05:05.063 --> 01:05:07.657
Just a mean mama,
won't let you follow your dreams?

01:05:09.317 --> 01:05:11.319
Well, I guess I'll be mean.

01:05:11.486 --> 01:05:14.740
I will not encourage you
to drive your lives straight into hell.

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.493
To be honest,
I can take it or leave it,

01:05:18.659 --> 01:05:20.502
but we are close
to getting a deal.

01:05:21.412 --> 01:05:23.414
They say Sister could be
like Diana Ross,

01:05:23.581 --> 01:05:25.925
and Sparkle could be
the next Smokey Robinson,

01:05:26.084 --> 01:05:28.086
as far as songwriting is concerned.

01:05:28.252 --> 01:05:30.596
Dolores, I've made it
very simple in this house.

01:05:30.755 --> 01:05:36.512
Respect, getting an education,
and having a relationship with the Lord.

01:05:36.677 --> 01:05:38.645
If you can't do that, then go.

01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:45.524
Why would the Lord give me this gift
if I wasn't supposed to use it?

01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:49.069
What'd you say?

01:05:51.526 --> 01:05:53.870
All I think about is music.

01:05:54.028 --> 01:05:56.827
Everything I see, hear or feel
turns into a song.

01:05:56.989 --> 01:06:00.084
And I try to turn it off, but I can't.

01:06:00.243 --> 01:06:03.668
And I know the Lord loves me
and he wouldn't torture me,

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:06.174
with something I want to do,
can't help but do.

01:06:06.332 --> 01:06:09.336
So I figured I...
You figured I was wrong.

01:06:11.546 --> 01:06:12.843
That I had a gift.

01:06:14.757 --> 01:06:18.762
Sparkle, you can have a gift.

01:06:18.928 --> 01:06:21.556
It's how you use it.

01:06:22.056 --> 01:06:23.524
You want to promote good,

01:06:23.683 --> 01:06:26.812
or you want more fast-tailed girls
out there having children?

01:06:29.564 --> 01:06:31.908
"Giving him something he can feel
to let him know his love is real"?

01:06:32.066 --> 01:06:33.158
Mama, that's private.

01:06:33.317 --> 01:06:35.866
Sparkle, it's trash.

01:06:36.237 --> 01:06:39.992
No, it's not.
Oh, yes, it is.

01:06:46.873 --> 01:06:50.377
We're sorry for disrespecting you
and the rules of your house.

01:06:51.085 --> 01:06:53.463
If you want me to go, I'll go.

01:06:55.423 --> 01:06:57.391
But I can't stop now, Mama,
I'm too close.

01:06:59.677 --> 01:07:04.228
Another little girl with a dream,
thinks she's so different

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:07.189
than all the others
waiting to be discovered.

01:07:07.977 --> 01:07:09.069
You go to your meeting.

01:07:09.228 --> 01:07:12.107
In fact, I want you to,
so you can see what I already know.

01:07:12.273 --> 01:07:14.696
You ain't getting no deal!

01:07:14.859 --> 01:07:18.033
You step back in this house,
and you want to stay in this house,

01:07:18.196 --> 01:07:22.121
then this dream of yours is over.
Do you understand?

01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:24.501
Do you understand?

01:07:40.801 --> 01:07:43.145
I am so proud of you.

01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:48.060
So proud.

01:07:48.226 --> 01:07:50.320
You better keep writing those songs.

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.453
Hey, baby.

01:08:05.076 --> 01:08:06.919
What are you doing?

01:08:10.665 --> 01:08:13.464
Listen, I got something
I need you to read for me.

01:08:14.001 --> 01:08:15.378
What's this, new material?

01:08:15.545 --> 01:08:19.300
Now, I wants to keep my white money,
but I think this is a way

01:08:19.465 --> 01:08:22.844
to cross over
so I can get my black audience.

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:26.604
You know, Ham got me a gig
down over at Baker's.

01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:30.317
Tell me what you think.

01:08:31.102 --> 01:08:32.319
I'm honored.

01:08:34.397 --> 01:08:37.401
And I'm thrilled, and I'm happy.

01:08:37.567 --> 01:08:39.113
Come here.

01:08:40.152 --> 01:08:42.746
And I'm horny.

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:51.538
Come on, baby. Right now, baby.

01:08:51.706 --> 01:08:54.710
Come on, come on, baby,
we got to stay focused.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:56.752
Okay.

01:09:01.465 --> 01:09:03.091
Baby?

01:09:05.386 --> 01:09:06.979
Tell me the truth.

01:09:07.138 --> 01:09:09.435
Why'd the chicken cross the road?

01:09:09.599 --> 01:09:12.227
Because two black guys
were chasing him with a biscuit.

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:19.783
No, because the chicken was trying
to get away from your turkey ass.

01:09:29.076 --> 01:09:31.124
Two black guys
walking down the street.

01:09:31.287 --> 01:09:32.663
Boy, they were just walking.

01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:34.798
They were walking, they were walking...

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:36.504
Finally they said, "You know what?

01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:39.796
We need a punch line right here,
because this joke ain't got none."

01:09:44.675 --> 01:09:47.929
My joke ain't got no punch line,
but you brought your girl to see me.

01:09:48.095 --> 01:09:50.689
Well, I had to, you know, bring her
to see how funny you were not.

01:09:54.018 --> 01:09:56.191
You see, ladies and gentlemen?

01:09:56.354 --> 01:09:59.278
You give a monkey some money,
and he just don't know how to act.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.159
What's the matter?
You don't dig my sense of humor?

01:10:03.986 --> 01:10:05.238
Hmm?

01:10:06.697 --> 01:10:07.994
Man, you ain't shit.

01:10:11.494 --> 01:10:13.963
And I'm gonna show you why.
I ought to kick your ass!

01:10:15.331 --> 01:10:18.380
You want to play?
You're a wannabe!

01:10:18.542 --> 01:10:21.341
Snip-snip, hussy.
- You are nothing!

01:10:21.504 --> 01:10:22.721
Nothing!

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.431
Y'all give it up for Satin Struthers. Clap.
Hey, Tammy, nice to see you.

01:10:27.593 --> 01:10:29.140
You ain't never looked better.

01:11:46.964 --> 01:11:48.386
Columbia Records. May I help you?

01:11:48.549 --> 01:11:49.801
These girls, man.

01:12:10.613 --> 01:12:14.993
What the hell is that on top of your head?
The man said he wanted us dolled up.

01:12:15.159 --> 01:12:17.082
Plus, low maintenance
for medical school.

01:12:17.244 --> 01:12:20.339
I haven't gotten off the wait list,
but I think in the affirmative.

01:12:20.498 --> 01:12:23.627
No, not today, Dee.
Y'all supposed to look the same.

01:12:23.793 --> 01:12:26.262
How I'm supposed to sell that?
Better figure it out.

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:27.922
Sparkle, thank God you're here.

01:12:28.088 --> 01:12:30.090
What? What's wrong?
Look at her.

01:12:30.257 --> 01:12:32.100
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:12:32.259 --> 01:12:35.138
Stay here, look out for Sister.

01:12:35.763 --> 01:12:37.640
So, what do you think?

01:12:39.225 --> 01:12:42.320
We were taught that if we don't have
anything nice to say to not say anything.

01:12:42.478 --> 01:12:45.027
I want to hear it.
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:46.441
I'll be back.
I'll come.

01:12:46.607 --> 01:12:47.824
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:12:47.983 --> 01:12:50.156
I'll watch you pee.
You're not gonna disown me.

01:12:57.785 --> 01:13:01.506

Man, I told you not to bring her.
I tried.

01:13:05.918 --> 01:13:07.841
- Not hard enough.
- Look, I'm sorry.

01:13:08.003 --> 01:13:10.802
Just lock the door.
What is going on in here?

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.144
What else is he pushing into you
besides his fists?

01:13:16.303 --> 01:13:18.852
Just mind your business. I'm fine.

01:13:19.557 --> 01:13:20.604
I'm fine.

01:13:20.766 --> 01:13:23.315
So you just gonna let him kill you?
It's not that bad.

01:13:23.477 --> 01:13:26.526
It's nothing makeup can't cover up.

01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:29.693
You get me that face powder I needed?
Are you crazy?

01:13:29.859 --> 01:13:32.578
Give that to her and you're gonna
wind up looking like her.

01:13:32.736 --> 01:13:35.706
Look, if you want me to sing for
this man, I need my makeup.

01:13:35.865 --> 01:13:38.288
I didn't know what to do.
She's sick with or without it.

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:40.202
Oh, please, Sparkle!

01:13:40.369 --> 01:13:42.997
All you're worried about
is getting that record deal.

01:13:43.163 --> 01:13:46.508
You're not thinking about her. You're
busy using her like everybody else.

01:13:46.667 --> 01:13:49.591
That's crazy. That's my sister, I love her.
Then flush it.

01:13:49.753 --> 01:13:53.678
Come on. Come on! Just give it to me.
No, I'm not gonna let you kill yourself.

01:13:54.341 --> 01:13:55.433
Oh!

01:13:55.676 --> 01:13:57.053
What's going on?

01:13:57.219 --> 01:13:58.641
You tell me.

01:13:58.804 --> 01:14:01.398
My receptionist says
your lead singer is beat up

01:14:01.557 --> 01:14:04.185
and drugged up
in my damn utility closet.

01:14:04.351 --> 01:14:06.945
No, Sister, she ain't here yet.

01:14:07.104 --> 01:14:08.356
We'll be out in a second.

01:14:08.522 --> 01:14:10.024
Use your key.

01:14:17.489 --> 01:14:21.289
It's like I said.
I need to see them in the light of day.

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:57.954
Stix, baby, what's going on?
I'm leaving.

01:14:59.698 --> 01:15:01.291
Baby, I want you to come with me.

01:15:02.242 --> 01:15:05.166
We can go down to the courthouse,

01:15:05.329 --> 01:15:07.752
get married,
then leave if it makes it easier.

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:11.920
I hope that wasn't your proposal,
I imagined something different.

01:15:12.086 --> 01:15:16.341
Baby, we got to get out of here. People
are trying to destroy what we built.

01:15:16.507 --> 01:15:17.804
You and me, we started this.

01:15:17.967 --> 01:15:21.346
We'll put the group back together
when Sister gets well.

01:15:21.512 --> 01:15:24.686
Sparkle, it's over.

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:29.444
Baby, we got to start over,
and not here.

01:15:29.603 --> 01:15:32.482
I mean, Detroit...
Detroit is dying.

01:15:32.648 --> 01:15:34.901
All these riots.

01:15:35.067 --> 01:15:37.115
I even heard Motown
is moving to California.

01:15:37.277 --> 01:15:38.824
You're talking about California?

01:15:38.988 --> 01:15:42.959
I'm talking about going anywhere where
we can live our dreams. Why not?

01:15:46.161 --> 01:15:47.629
Huh?

01:15:48.664 --> 01:15:50.041
I can't leave, Stix.

01:15:54.294 --> 01:15:55.716
Then you stay, then.

01:15:55.879 --> 01:15:59.679
Don't make me choose
between my family and you, Stix.

01:15:59.842 --> 01:16:02.140
Baby, I'm not making you do anything.

01:16:03.303 --> 01:16:04.771
Stix, don't leave me.

01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.682
Sparkle, I'm asking you
to come with me.

01:16:08.726 --> 01:16:11.024
I'm asking you
to come with me as my wife.

01:16:13.105 --> 01:16:15.608
Baby, I need you to come with me.

01:16:15.774 --> 01:16:16.991
You coming?

01:16:21.572 --> 01:16:24.917
You know, your mama really
did a number on you, baby.

01:16:48.932 --> 01:16:52.436
Come on, Sparkle. She doesn't need
those dresses, she needs clothes.

01:16:52.603 --> 01:16:54.822
I'm coming.
Well, hurry up.

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:56.277
You two are funny.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.068
You can pack the bed if you want.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:16:59.234 --> 01:17:02.078
Oh, yes, you are. You awake?
You awake now?

01:17:02.237 --> 01:17:03.989
Get off me!
Get up.

01:17:04.156 --> 01:17:06.909
Get off me.
Get up. Let's go.

01:17:07.076 --> 01:17:09.704
Want to be manhandled? Come on.
Get off me.

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:11.213
Don't hurt her.

01:17:11.371 --> 01:17:13.214
You didn't say anything
when she hit me.

01:17:13.373 --> 01:17:15.421
No.
What is wrong with you?

01:17:15.584 --> 01:17:19.214
Stop it. Stop, come on. Stop, guys.

01:17:25.969 --> 01:17:27.892
What's going on, baby?

01:17:31.308 --> 01:17:34.357
Uh, they call themselves saving me,

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.241
but I told them
I wasn't going anywhere.

01:17:44.071 --> 01:17:46.574
Y'all need to get the hell
out of my house.

01:17:48.408 --> 01:17:50.627
We're sorry we brought
chaos into your home,

01:17:50.786 --> 01:17:53.380
but our sister is sick.
We just want her to get well.

01:17:53.539 --> 01:17:56.418
She's not listening to us,
but if you told her, she would go.

01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:59.006
Or for her to go, she...

01:17:59.169 --> 01:18:00.261
You talk too damn much!

01:18:02.131 --> 01:18:04.475
Learn to shut your mouth.

01:18:04.925 --> 01:18:07.178
That's my sister!

01:18:07.344 --> 01:18:08.812
Oh, y'all want some of this?

01:18:08.971 --> 01:18:10.598
Y'all want some of this?

01:18:10.764 --> 01:18:12.516
Y'all want some of me?

01:18:12.683 --> 01:18:15.983
Shit! Get off me! Get off me!

01:18:16.145 --> 01:18:18.443
The hell's wrong with you?

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:24.324
Come on, you want it too? Huh?

01:18:25.154 --> 01:18:26.747
Little Miss Sparkle. Aah!

01:18:46.592 --> 01:18:49.721
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Is he dead?

01:18:56.393 --> 01:18:58.566
Give this to me.

01:18:58.729 --> 01:19:01.403
You need to get out of here.
Oh, my God.

01:19:01.565 --> 01:19:04.739
No. No. No.

01:19:05.736 --> 01:19:08.990
Come on, wake up. Please.

01:19:09.156 --> 01:19:12.581
Come on. One, two, three.

01:19:12.743 --> 01:19:15.872
One, two, three.

01:19:16.038 --> 01:19:17.711
Please, wake, wake, wake.

01:19:23.045 --> 01:19:24.467
Wake up.

01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:26.632
Please, wake, wake, wake.

01:19:26.798 --> 01:19:28.175
Wake up.

01:19:28.342 --> 01:19:30.640
Please wake up.
He's dead.

01:19:30.802 --> 01:19:33.772
Sister, he's not dead.
Look at me. He's dead.

01:19:35.265 --> 01:19:36.437
He's dead.
No!

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.318
You have to go.
No.

01:19:38.477 --> 01:19:43.028
Mama was right. If I hadn't been scared
to sing, we would've never had a group.

01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:47.161
He would've never went after you...
I would love to hug you right now,

01:19:47.319 --> 01:19:50.914
and tell you why this isn't your fault,
but I can't.

01:19:51.073 --> 01:19:52.450
You just have to go.

01:19:52.616 --> 01:19:54.869
Dee, you get out of here!

01:19:55.035 --> 01:19:57.129
You take her with you! Go!

01:19:57.287 --> 01:19:59.756
Don't say anything to anyone.

01:19:59.915 --> 01:20:01.838
You were never here.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.877
- Go!
- Come on, come on.

01:20:04.044 --> 01:20:05.762
We can't leave her here.

01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:16.482
Goddamn you! Goddamn you!

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.688
Damn it!

01:20:25.399 --> 01:20:28.573
Oh, baby.

01:20:28.735 --> 01:20:30.453
Baby.

01:20:30.612 --> 01:20:33.456
Baby, what did we do?

01:20:33.615 --> 01:20:37.085

With all that's been going on,

01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:26.409
I couldn't find the right
time to tell you, Mama.

01:25:28.076 --> 01:25:31.080
I got accepted into
Meharry Medical School.

01:25:32.247 --> 01:25:34.124
Most of it is covered by scholarships,

01:25:34.291 --> 01:25:36.589
but I have to go in early
to do some research.

01:25:39.754 --> 01:25:44.681
Well, I guess the haircut worked, huh?

01:25:45.218 --> 01:25:46.720
I guess it did.

01:25:46.886 --> 01:25:51.892
Maybe I'll get one of them Afros
and bring some luck to myself.

01:25:52.058 --> 01:25:54.481
Congratulations.

01:25:54.644 --> 01:25:56.692
Thank you.

01:25:58.565 --> 01:26:00.659
Don't cry.

01:26:00.817 --> 01:26:02.069
We've done enough of that.

01:26:03.403 --> 01:26:08.330
These are happy tears. It makes me feel
like I've done something right.

01:26:10.493 --> 01:26:14.418
I used to complain
that you never let us do anything.

01:26:15.999 --> 01:26:18.969
And I thank you for that kind of love.

01:26:19.878 --> 01:26:21.972
And I'm sorry
for calling it something else.

01:26:25.008 --> 01:26:29.855
You'll never understand
how much your belief in me means.

01:26:31.848 --> 01:26:32.940
I love you, Mama.

01:26:33.099 --> 01:26:35.477
Oh, Mommy loves you.

01:26:35.644 --> 01:26:38.193
So proud of you.

01:26:40.106 --> 01:26:41.574
My baby, the doctor.

01:26:44.277 --> 01:26:46.154
Take care.

01:27:06.633 --> 01:27:09.011
<i>Hey, Spark, it's gonna be okay.</i>

01:27:09.177 --> 01:27:13.478
<i>You know, two or three years,
and I'll be out of here.</i>

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.642
<i>- Dee left for school, right?
- Yeah.</i>

01:27:16.476 --> 01:27:17.944
That's good.

01:27:19.396 --> 01:27:23.526
It's funny. We always said we'd have to
replace one singer in the group.

01:27:23.692 --> 01:27:26.320
Now we have to replace two.

01:27:26.486 --> 01:27:28.363
I bet Stix is fit to be tied.

01:27:33.535 --> 01:27:35.128
You two broke up?

01:27:37.414 --> 01:27:38.916
Yeah.

01:27:39.541 --> 01:27:41.543
When did that happen?

01:27:41.793 --> 01:27:44.342
The day we lost the record deal.

01:27:48.007 --> 01:27:50.476
I'm so sorry, Spark.

01:27:50.635 --> 01:27:52.512
It's okay.

01:27:53.638 --> 01:27:56.187
Wasn't meant to be, I guess.

01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:02.446
Don't come back here.

01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:06.739
I'm the only one that comes to visit.
I'm not gonna leave you by yourself.

01:28:06.901 --> 01:28:08.027
I got in here by myself.

01:28:08.194 --> 01:28:09.446
You didn't.
Yes, I did.

01:28:09.612 --> 01:28:12.286
You think now's the time for me
to be lying to myself?

01:28:12.449 --> 01:28:14.872
Don't you think
I did enough of that already?

01:28:15.618 --> 01:28:19.373
I'm not gonna let you
crawl up in here and die with me.

01:28:22.834 --> 01:28:27.715
I hope you see
that I am trying to save your life.

01:28:31.468 --> 01:28:33.721

Sparkle, curl your hair. Get to bed.

01:29:03.708 --> 01:29:06.006
Church in the morning.

01:30:30.336 --> 01:30:31.838
Hi. How may I help you?

01:30:32.005 --> 01:30:33.928
I'm here to see Larry Robinson.

01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:36.263
Do you have an appointment?
No.

01:30:36.426 --> 01:30:39.646
I'm sorry. You need an appointment.

01:30:41.514 --> 01:30:43.357
Okay. I'll wait.

01:31:14.964 --> 01:31:16.762
Mr. Robinson will see you now.

01:31:34.943 --> 01:31:38.538
Okay, we're just going to have to admit
we're wasting a lot of money.

01:31:42.075 --> 01:31:45.796
We'll salvage what we can salvage,
make jambalaya out of the rest.

01:31:47.789 --> 01:31:50.167
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

01:31:51.292 --> 01:31:53.294
I have two minutes. Go.

01:31:53.461 --> 01:31:57.056
Well, let me not waste them
on why I need you.

01:31:57.215 --> 01:31:58.262
That's obvious.

01:31:58.424 --> 01:32:00.392
Let me tell you why you need me.

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.354
That's a big setup.
I hope you can deliver.

01:32:03.513 --> 01:32:07.609
I'm beautiful, I can sing, and I write
hits, sometimes two and three a day.

01:32:07.767 --> 01:32:10.395
I've been kissed, 20 about that alone.

01:32:10.561 --> 01:32:11.938
I've been in love, 22.

01:32:12.105 --> 01:32:13.948
My heart's been broken, 30.

01:32:14.107 --> 01:32:17.077
I'm a virgin, so I have 80
on what making love will be like.

01:32:17.610 --> 01:32:19.863
I have a complicated relationship
with my mother.

01:32:20.029 --> 01:32:22.782
I don't know my daddy,
tack on another 50.

01:32:22.949 --> 01:32:26.704
War sucks, flowers are pretty in the rain,
and it's hard to follow your dreams,

01:32:26.869 --> 01:32:30.464
but you have to, because you might
write a song that saves someone's life.

01:32:30.623 --> 01:32:33.877
I have a great song about that
because I'm trying to save my own.

01:32:35.753 --> 01:32:39.508
So can we do business?

01:33:03.656 --> 01:33:04.999
Hi.

01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:07.497
I saw Larry Robinson today.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:11.335
He said he'd love to come and see
my show, but I don't have a show.

01:33:11.497 --> 01:33:12.965
Figured I ought to get one.

01:33:14.584 --> 01:33:16.211
We only have one shot at this.

01:33:19.547 --> 01:33:21.299
Better make it count.

01:33:28.389 --> 01:33:30.733
I'm glad I didn't leave. Heh.

01:33:45.573 --> 01:33:48.918
Hi, Mama.
Hi.

01:33:50.745 --> 01:33:52.622
May I come in?

01:34:11.557 --> 01:34:13.525
Hey, Sparkle.
How you doing, baby?

01:34:13.684 --> 01:34:15.061
You look good.

01:34:15.228 --> 01:34:17.447
Little skinny, but good.

01:34:17.605 --> 01:34:19.073
So how's the new job?

01:34:19.232 --> 01:34:21.781
It's great. How are you doing?

01:34:21.943 --> 01:34:24.196
Oh, I'm good. Always good, baby.

01:34:30.201 --> 01:34:34.081
I have a flyer for my show.

01:34:43.881 --> 01:34:46.555
It's my own concert.

01:34:46.717 --> 01:34:49.937
I'm not opening up for anybody,
just me.

01:34:52.348 --> 01:34:54.191
I would really love it if you'd come.

01:35:02.316 --> 01:35:05.445
Bye.
Bye, baby.

01:35:12.368 --> 01:35:15.872
How many times you gonna keep
making the same mistake, Emma?

01:35:25.214 --> 01:35:27.888
You know the bit, right?
Let's hear it one more time.

01:35:31.137 --> 01:35:33.060
You like it?
Uh-huh.

01:35:33.222 --> 01:35:34.724
Okay.
Okay, ladies.

01:35:34.891 --> 01:35:37.110
Go home and get some rest.
Seven p.m. sharp.

01:35:37.268 --> 01:35:38.315
Yes, boss.
Thank you.

01:35:38.477 --> 01:35:39.649
Bye, Sparkle.
See you.

01:35:39.812 --> 01:35:42.110
Happy birthday. Love you.
Yeah. Happy birthday.

01:35:42.273 --> 01:35:44.150
Thank you.

01:35:44.317 --> 01:35:48.197
Yes, okay, guys. Tomorrow, 6:00.

01:35:50.615 --> 01:35:53.459
How you feeling? Good?

01:35:53.618 --> 01:35:55.837
We can't do this, Stix.

01:35:58.581 --> 01:36:01.710
You know, we gonna be fine.

01:36:01.876 --> 01:36:04.755
You gonna be fine.
What if I'm not?

01:36:06.589 --> 01:36:07.966
Well, close your eyes.

01:36:08.132 --> 01:36:11.602
Stix, I'm not trying to be dramatic.
I'm trying to be serious.

01:36:11.761 --> 01:36:14.514
Sparkle, close your eyes.

01:36:18.851 --> 01:36:19.898

01:38:03.414 --> 01:38:05.462
Make a wish, baby.

01:38:10.212 --> 01:38:11.555
Ask me what I wished for.

01:38:13.466 --> 01:38:14.638
What'd you wish for?

01:38:16.302 --> 01:38:18.805
That you would ask me
to marry you again,

01:38:18.971 --> 01:38:21.941
but better, and with a ring.

01:38:22.099 --> 01:38:24.477
What? Did you peek?

01:38:28.105 --> 01:38:29.857
That's your gift.

01:38:37.198 --> 01:38:41.123
And tomorrow, our lives are going
to change, for better or for worse.

01:38:42.286 --> 01:38:43.959
Whatever it is,

01:38:44.121 --> 01:38:45.964
I just want to be with you.

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.175
Now, of course, if it's better,
you get a better ring.

01:38:51.337 --> 01:38:55.058
And if it's worse, then that ring is going
to be dinner for the next few nights.

01:38:58.761 --> 01:39:00.229
See, even you're not so sure.

01:39:00.513 --> 01:39:02.140
Mm-mm.

01:39:16.362 --> 01:39:18.160
I'm sure.

01:39:19.407 --> 01:39:21.284
And I love you.

01:39:21.826 --> 01:39:24.579
And I'm going to be standing
right over there in them wings.

01:39:29.583 --> 01:39:31.130
I love you too.

01:39:49.562 --> 01:39:50.939
You got five minutes.

01:40:12.251 --> 01:40:13.628
You look tired.

01:40:18.716 --> 01:40:20.468
I am.

01:40:24.013 --> 01:40:25.606
Yeah.

01:40:27.433 --> 01:40:29.276
Me too.

01:40:31.187 --> 01:40:34.111
Well, what do you think?

01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:36.526
Oh, my gosh!

01:40:36.692 --> 01:40:38.615
Oh. Oh, you're bleeding.

01:40:38.777 --> 01:40:40.575
- What?
- Oh, no.

01:40:40.738 --> 01:40:42.035
My dress!
No, no, no.

01:40:42.198 --> 01:40:44.542
Look at it, it's ruined.
Okay, just hold.

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:46.543
Look at my dress. It's ruined.
I know.

01:40:46.702 --> 01:40:49.751
Okay, just breathe, please.
We'll stop the bleeding.

01:40:49.914 --> 01:40:51.257
I know, I know, I know.

01:40:51.415 --> 01:40:53.292
Well, maybe you can wear this one.

01:40:54.126 --> 01:40:56.220
Let's see.

01:40:56.378 --> 01:40:57.675
Mama?

01:40:57.838 --> 01:40:58.930
Hey, baby.

01:40:59.089 --> 01:41:00.762
Emma.
Hey, sweetheart.

01:41:02.968 --> 01:41:05.437
You guys, come on.

01:41:06.639 --> 01:41:08.016
It's okay.

01:41:12.144 --> 01:41:14.693
I don't want to get all mushy, okay?

01:41:15.439 --> 01:41:16.486
Okay.

01:41:17.233 --> 01:41:20.112
I just came to help
my baby get dressed.

01:41:21.612 --> 01:41:25.492
Well, like Dolores said,
lean back and pinch, okay?

01:41:25.658 --> 01:41:28.662
Just try it. Let's see. Okay.
Let's just count.

01:41:28.827 --> 01:41:33.503

01:41:37.044 --> 01:41:38.671
Fantastic turnout.

01:41:38.837 --> 01:41:41.135
- I hope you are proud. Wow.
- I love this.

01:41:41.298 --> 01:41:42.345
And you mean to say,

01:41:42.508 --> 01:41:45.387
that just you and your friends
and neighbors sold tickets?

01:41:45.553 --> 01:41:46.975
Yes, sir, and I told you too.

01:41:47.137 --> 01:41:49.185
Yeah, you told me.
I told you.

01:41:51.892 --> 01:41:53.235
Oh, yeah.

01:41:54.687 --> 01:41:56.655
You look beautiful.

01:41:56.814 --> 01:41:59.818
You don't think it's too much,
or not enough?

01:41:59.984 --> 01:42:03.864
If you're gonna go out there, you gotta
give them something they can feel.

01:42:04.029 --> 01:42:06.031
Or at least imagine feeling.

01:42:07.074 --> 01:42:12.956
Plus, Sister said make it sexy
so you can't run or hide.

01:42:14.039 --> 01:42:15.131
You went to see her.

01:42:17.418 --> 01:42:18.465
What's wrong?

01:42:18.627 --> 01:42:20.174
Oh, nothing.

01:42:21.338 --> 01:42:24.182
I always knew you had the gift.

01:42:24.341 --> 01:42:28.391
Not just in singing,
but you believe in yourself,

01:42:29.013 --> 01:42:31.983
even when I tried to stop you
at every turn.

01:42:32.725 --> 01:42:35.478
Takes a lot of faith to do that, Sparkle.

01:42:36.645 --> 01:42:38.318
Thank you.

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.482
Don't lose it.

01:42:41.150 --> 01:42:43.494
Some of us are still trying to find it.

01:42:44.653 --> 01:42:45.700
Promise.

01:42:48.949 --> 01:42:50.075
You're staying, right?

01:42:50.743 --> 01:42:53.872
But of course.
I didn't get dressed for my health.

01:42:55.539 --> 01:42:58.463
And I'll sit far enough in the back
so I don't upstage you.

01:43:03.088 --> 01:43:04.260
You look great.

01:43:04.423 --> 01:43:06.767
I love you.
I love you too.

01:43:06.925 --> 01:43:08.927

Whoo! You can do it, girl!

01:43:51.553 --> 01:43:53.271
