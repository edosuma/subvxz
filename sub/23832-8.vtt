WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:18.435 --> 00:19.853
Good morning.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.187
Yumeko!

00:21.271 --> 00:23.022
What are you looking at?

00:23.815 --> 00:25.442
This is...

00:26.025 --> 00:30.405
She's an indie idol
and a member of the student council too.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.492
Oh, I didn't know there was someone
like that on the student council.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.202
Yumemi Yumemite.

00:36.619 --> 00:39.039
She's a second-year student.
She's in charge of publicity.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.458
She's gotten three million views
on YourTube,

00:42.125 --> 00:45.044
and they say she's sure to make it big.

00:45.795 --> 00:48.965
Sometimes, she does concerts at school,

00:49.048 --> 00:52.802
but she's so popular, unless you're
in her fan club, you can't get in.

00:54.012 --> 01:00.518
- You know a lot about her, huh?
- As a classmate, I want to support her,

01:00.602 --> 01:03.646
- but the club fees are expensive.
- Thanks, everybody!

01:03.730 --> 01:08.902
If you enjoyed it, click "like" and spread
the word! Share me with your friends!

01:10.987 --> 01:11.821
Huh?

01:12.363 --> 01:13.406
What's this?

02:56.551 --> 02:57.760
President!

02:58.344 --> 02:59.762
Oh, Sayaka.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.390
Where are you going?

03:02.807 --> 03:05.018
You didn't tell me.

03:05.101 --> 03:09.355
I'll be leaving the school for a while.
There's something I have to do.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.316
But now's not a good time.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.444
Yesterday, Ikishima and Yumeko Jabami--

03:14.527 --> 03:17.739
I heard.
That's why I have to take care of this.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.745
You can deal with the rest
however you wish.

03:23.828 --> 03:28.750
- I'm counting on you.
- But... I need you here...

03:28.833 --> 03:30.877
- Please wait!
- That's enough.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.511
It's been a week since then.

03:41.095 --> 03:45.350
The student council isn't always united.
Some plot to increase their power.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.437
Some just want to protect themselves.
Some pursue pleasure.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.648
Some are inscrutable.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.819
The only thing that ties us together
is our power as the student council...

03:56.903 --> 03:58.947
which comes from the authority
of the president.

03:59.781 --> 04:04.619
But the appearance of Yumeko Jabami
is changing all that.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.580
It's been a week
since Ikishima embarrassed herself.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.541
And the student council president
hasn't come to school.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.961
- Why?
- Well...

04:13.503 --> 04:15.755
I haven't been told.

04:15.838 --> 04:21.052
Yeah? I was sure she'd have told you.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.973
Then I suppose we'll have to decide

04:25.056 --> 04:29.018
what to do with the two
who lost to the house pets ourselves.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.981
Neither Ikishima nor Nishinotoin lost.

04:33.606 --> 04:37.568
They saved face with the help of
the president and the pity of their enemy.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.947
The rumors are spreading
throughout the school,

04:41.030 --> 04:43.032
and our reputation is in the gutter.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.745
It's pathetic. What makes you think
you can even come here?

04:47.829 --> 04:51.541
Manyuda! It's inappropriate to speak
to a third-year student that way.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.171
The concept of "inappropriate"
doesn't exist in this school.

04:58.047 --> 05:01.426
You're the closest to the president.
You should understand better than anyone,

05:01.509 --> 05:02.927
Sayaka Igarashi.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.598
You try and have at it with Yumeko.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.979
Why do I have to try for a house pet?

05:13.563 --> 05:17.025
Yumeko's got guts, a sharp eye...

05:17.108 --> 05:21.654
trust in her companion,
everything she needs.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.699
And more than anything, those eyes!

05:24.782 --> 05:26.576
Just thinking of them makes me...

05:31.247 --> 05:34.125
Ikishima, we're still in the middle
of our conference.

05:37.336 --> 05:39.756
Bathroom.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.010
It's not worth listening
to the ramblings of a pervert.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.220
Her appraisal isn't wrong.

05:46.304 --> 05:52.351
Yumeko Jabami is a house pet,
and that's what makes her so terrifying.

05:53.061 --> 05:57.231
If she uses her right
to challenge the president to a match...

05:58.232 --> 06:00.234
depending on what the game is...

06:00.318 --> 06:05.740
The president becomes a house pet.
It's the same for anybody, if they lose.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.992
I'll never let that happen!

06:08.576 --> 06:10.495
I'm opposed to it.

06:10.578 --> 06:14.624
We should recover the debt we're owed
to decrease the amount of money she has.

06:15.374 --> 06:19.128
Did you forget?
The president forbids that.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.006
She has a life plan drawn up for her.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.716
YUMEKO JABAMI
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

06:23.800 --> 06:27.678
Yes, I suppose she passes.
Leave Yumeko to me!

06:27.762 --> 06:29.263
THE GIRL WHO DANCES LOVE

06:29.347 --> 06:31.182
- Yumemite, you...
- Yumemite...

06:31.891 --> 06:34.185
I'll do it with Yumeko.

06:34.769 --> 06:35.895
I see.

06:35.978 --> 06:41.025
It'd be simple for you to make a stage
that would crush Yumeko Jabami.

06:41.109 --> 06:45.947
Right? I want to go big
if we're going to do it, though.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.783
I want your help, Manyuda.

06:48.866 --> 06:53.121
Very well. I'll ensure
that all preparations are made.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.791
Wait! We should wait
for the president's orders.

06:58.292 --> 07:01.337
No. I can't stop them on my own.

07:02.088 --> 07:06.300
I don't even know
what the president wants.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.845
It's fine!

07:08.928 --> 07:12.056
Leave it to us second-year students.

07:12.140 --> 07:16.144
The student council should start thinking
about the next generation soon, right?

07:24.402 --> 07:26.320
Did something good happen to her?

07:26.404 --> 07:29.866
I don't know.
She's been like this all day.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.619
Was there something in that letter?

07:34.203 --> 07:35.246
Letter?

07:35.329 --> 07:36.747
Jabami- senpai...

07:37.331 --> 07:42.295
It's been a long time. I'm Itsuki Sumeragi
with the Year One, Flower Class.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.546
Ta-da!

07:43.629 --> 07:47.008
Japanese-style Mont Blanc from Seifudo.
I brought it as a present.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.343
That's our...

07:49.427 --> 07:51.095
It's so good!

07:51.679 --> 07:56.601
I know you. You got fired by
the student council a few days ago, right?

07:57.185 --> 08:03.232
So, is the plan now to find some dirt
on Yumeko and get your job back?

08:03.774 --> 08:04.609
How obvious!

08:05.193 --> 08:09.989
Oh, no, of course not.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.747
Fine.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.249
I'll tell you everything.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.044
My father...

08:23.628 --> 08:26.923
The CEO of one of Japan's
biggest toymakers, right?

08:27.006 --> 08:30.092
I'm jealous that your future
is so assured.

08:30.176 --> 08:35.932
It's not like that, though.
My father is a stern and practical man.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.184
He told me to join the student council

08:38.267 --> 08:40.895
and develop connections
to the political and financial worlds.

08:40.978 --> 08:46.484
That's why I came here.
If I can't do that, he might disown me!

08:47.401 --> 08:52.031
Jabami- senpai,  is it true that you want
to be student council president?

08:52.990 --> 08:59.497
It's a rumor I heard. The students,
particularly the house pets, are hopeful.

09:00.122 --> 09:06.671
Despite the money you won at the Debt
Settlement Party, you remain a house pet.

09:06.754 --> 09:11.259
Because you want to challenge
the president to a match and win her seat.

09:13.970 --> 09:18.015
Yumeko is just gambling
because she wants to.

09:18.891 --> 09:19.767
But...

09:20.351 --> 09:25.147
at some point, the whole school
started to revolve around Yumeko.

09:25.731 --> 09:30.653
If that rumor is true,
there's only one path for me to take.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.657
I have to have you
become student council president.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.867
Then let me join the student council.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.996
I'll do whatever it takes for that.

09:40.538 --> 09:44.375
That's my plan. I'm not hiding it at all.

09:46.043 --> 09:50.006
Please, let me join you.

09:50.506 --> 09:55.720
Of course, you're welcome! I don't know
about being the student council president,

09:55.803 --> 09:58.180
but we both gambled together, didn't we?

10:00.558 --> 10:03.394
We're friends now, right?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.188
That's right.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.445
Is her head filled with flowers?

10:14.030 --> 10:17.366
- DVDs on sale!
- Her new CD is here!

10:20.244 --> 10:22.580
Another amazing concert!

10:23.164 --> 10:25.791
Shinnoji, you came to see me again!

10:25.875 --> 10:27.084
Of course!

10:27.168 --> 10:30.463
As president of your fan club,
I'll never miss one!

10:30.546 --> 10:34.216
But the clapping was off
during "Gambling Girl" today, wasn't it?

10:34.300 --> 10:38.721
- I'll make sure it's corrected.
- Don't be too harsh on them.

10:38.804 --> 10:43.684
I'll make sure to train them properly
since your major debut is coming up.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.895
That's my responsibility as president.

10:45.978 --> 10:51.067
People like that are skipping out on
their quota of 100 YourTube views a day!

10:51.150 --> 10:54.528
I won't insist they do it
with five smartphones like I do,

10:54.612 --> 10:59.492
but they need at least 100 plays a day
or they can't say they're a fan!

11:01.369 --> 11:02.286
DRESSING ROOM

11:14.423 --> 11:17.134
Those pigs are disgusting!

11:21.806 --> 11:25.851
Should we at least stop
the post-concert meet-and-greet?

11:26.352 --> 11:29.397
No. It can't just be the concerts.

11:29.480 --> 11:34.193
Relating to them one-on-one
is what makes them die-hard fans.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.945
But still...

11:36.404 --> 11:40.574
It's fine, Saori. This is nothing
if it helps me with my dream.

11:41.283 --> 11:45.454
If I can't do this,
I can never make my dream come true.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.167
Anyway, when are you sending Yumeko
the message?

11:50.251 --> 11:55.047
I can do it tomorrow.
Manyuda has prepared the budget.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.300
I see. I can't wait.

12:00.511 --> 12:04.265
Yumeko's going to bet her life!

12:06.225 --> 12:08.727
What? You're gambling with Yumemite?

12:08.811 --> 12:12.231
Yes. Her manager just came by.

12:12.815 --> 12:17.403
Oh, no. Yumeko has taken out one member
of the student council after another.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.656
I'm sure they're after her.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.577
Okay, Manyuda, take care of the rest.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.870
Leave it to me.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.789
With the president gone,
now's the perfect chance

12:29.248 --> 12:33.002
for us second-year students
to take power in the student council.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.796
I'll get the event ready.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.467
Make sure you don't let Jabami beat you.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.762
You're such a worrywart, Manyuda.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.270
May Ryota come with me?

12:51.854 --> 12:54.940
A boy? Well, I guess it's okay.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.443
Thank you. Okay!

12:58.861 --> 13:00.321
Wait!

13:00.404 --> 13:01.697
I'll get permission now.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.950
I'm sorry. I was just in a hurry.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.162
Let me pat you down before you enter.

13:08.704 --> 13:13.584
Once in a while, people try to set up
cameras and listening devices in her room.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.461
Yes, that's fine.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.467
Welcome. I'm Yumemi Yumemite.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.969
I'm an idol.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.597
Hello, Yumemite.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.933
Who's that boy?

13:29.850 --> 13:32.645
I'm Ryota,
with the Year Two, Flower Class--

13:32.728 --> 13:34.104
Ryota Suzui!

13:34.188 --> 13:36.524
You came to my concert, right?

13:36.607 --> 13:39.818
The second day
of the three-day school festival concert!

13:40.861 --> 13:42.988
I'm amazed you remember that.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.865
That was a long time ago.

13:45.282 --> 13:48.577
I remember the names and faces
of all my fans.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.162
Every good idol does.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.457
So, how are you going to gamble with me?

13:53.541 --> 13:55.501
Oh, right. Gambling.

13:56.252 --> 14:00.339
- Look at this.
- "Top Idol Match"?

14:00.422 --> 14:04.260
It sounds like a variety program.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.137
It was actually a plan for a TV show,

14:07.221 --> 14:10.641
but if I can do it with you,
that'd be great.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.894
In front of everyone, after the concert.

14:14.478 --> 14:18.482
- I hope I don't get in the way.
- Of course you won't.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.403
This concert is our chance
to pick a new member.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.739
The bet is 50 million yen.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.201
That's enough to get you out
of being a house pet, right?

14:29.285 --> 14:30.578
- Yes.
- And...

14:30.661 --> 14:35.249
if I win, of course,
your debt amount will increase.

14:35.749 --> 14:39.962
And if that happens...
you'll form an idol unit with me.

14:40.796 --> 14:45.926
I'll have your life plan changed
to reflect that.

14:46.510 --> 14:50.431
I've even got a unit name.
It's "Dreaming Creaming Sisters"!

14:50.514 --> 14:52.933
What?

14:53.017 --> 14:56.395
We both have "yume,"
or "dream" in our names.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.188
Don't you think that's fate?

14:58.772 --> 15:02.026
But being an idol isn't always fun.

15:02.109 --> 15:05.988
Lessons are hard,
and you don't have a private life.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.782
And of course,
romance is out of the question.

15:08.866 --> 15:12.661
You'll have to adjust
your whole life around being an idol.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.246
I see.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.333
But why are you so willing to be an idol?

15:17.416 --> 15:20.294
Of course, for the smiles of my fans.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.047
Don't lie to me.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.884
You hate your fans, right?

15:29.053 --> 15:32.139
What are you saying? That's impossible.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.891
Oh, you're sure?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.560
Then what is this?

15:42.232 --> 15:43.859
Maybe I'll read a little!

15:44.443 --> 15:50.157
"To my beloved Yumemi. Thanks for your
fun concerts! You always do a great job!

15:50.741 --> 15:53.535
Lately, you've been so popular
on YourTube,

15:53.619 --> 15:56.121
I'm very proud to head your fan club.

15:57.331 --> 16:01.710
But as a long-time fan, I'm a little sad.

16:02.252 --> 16:07.383
Lately, I've been busy studying,
but when I see how hard you're working..."

16:07.466 --> 16:08.550
Enough!

16:09.134 --> 16:09.969
Yumemi...

16:10.678 --> 16:12.554
You're right.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.348
So, what?

16:14.431 --> 16:18.268
If you're continuing being an idol
even though you hate your fans,

16:18.352 --> 16:21.063
you must have some kind of strong goal.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.693
If I don't know what that is, then I...

16:31.573 --> 16:36.453
I want an Academy Award.
I've always wanted one since I was little.

16:37.705 --> 16:42.960
A space where only those with talent,
skill, and luck are allowed to walk.

16:43.627 --> 16:47.131
The whole world watching their every move.

16:47.881 --> 16:52.136
I want to be one of the flowers
on the red carpet too!

16:52.720 --> 16:56.181
I joined an agency,
took lessons every day,

16:56.265 --> 16:59.935
and got a regular spot on a TV show
faster than anybody.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.022
But I realized it was taking too long.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.357
Even if things kept going well,

17:05.441 --> 17:08.902
there was no guarantee
I could get to the top of Japan.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.614
If I wanted a major role
in a Hollywood movie...

17:12.698 --> 17:14.950
I needed a different approach.

17:15.534 --> 17:19.455
And that was this school...
and being an idol!

17:20.039 --> 17:24.334
With the power of this school, I could
easily become the most popular idol.

17:24.418 --> 17:27.087
If I became an actress
at the peak of my popularity,

17:27.171 --> 17:30.340
I could instantly be one
of the top actresses in Japan.

17:30.424 --> 17:34.470
At that point,
being in a Hollywood movie would be easy.

17:35.054 --> 17:40.017
That's splendid. That's why you're
doing this even though you hate it, huh?

17:40.100 --> 17:42.603
- Interacting with your fans?
- That's right.

17:42.686 --> 17:46.440
They're ugly, but that's okay.

17:46.857 --> 17:50.944
That means they're spending money on me
instead of their own looks.

17:51.028 --> 17:55.032
But... why the hell are they dancing
like madmen at my concerts?

17:55.115 --> 17:57.743
If you've got time to dance,
listen to my songs!

17:57.826 --> 18:00.621
Why are you sweating more than I am?

18:00.704 --> 18:04.917
Stop trying to shake my hand
when yours is sweaty! It's disgusting!

18:08.170 --> 18:10.172
It's hard being an idol, huh?

18:10.756 --> 18:14.259
Get ready. You're gonna do it too.

18:14.843 --> 18:19.473
From what you've said,
I don't want to be an idol at all.

18:20.140 --> 18:20.974
But...

18:21.642 --> 18:27.356
dedicating my life to a job like that...
It's a wonderful risk!

18:27.940 --> 18:30.651
I'll teach you all you need to know.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.403
But it's not a fun game

18:33.487 --> 18:37.491
unless we're both
betting our lives, right?

18:41.036 --> 18:41.870
What are you...?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.668
I took the liberty
of recording this conversation.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.797
To be honest, I didn't think
the letter would be good enough.

18:52.089 --> 18:56.885
If this goes public,
your life as an idol is over, right?

18:58.095 --> 19:01.098
Why are you sweating more than I am?

19:01.181 --> 19:05.060
Stop trying to shake my hands
when yours are sweaty! It's disgusting!

19:05.144 --> 19:08.605
- Yumeko...
- Why? Why does Saori have that?

19:08.689 --> 19:09.857
No, I...

19:11.608 --> 19:12.943
That was when...

19:13.569 --> 19:17.156
Let's bet this voice recorder, too.

19:17.948 --> 19:18.991
Give me that!

19:21.118 --> 19:25.122
Don't worry. I wouldn't do anything
so crude as make copies.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.834
If I can gamble,
that's good enough for me.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.423
I'll look forward to the day of the game.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.134
Well...

19:39.052 --> 19:40.095
Yumeko!

19:44.516 --> 19:47.227
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

19:47.311 --> 19:51.315
Because of me, your dream... our dream...

20:00.991 --> 20:02.868
Fine, then!

20:02.951 --> 20:08.040
Yumeko Jabami!
I'll make you regret messing with me!

20:11.376 --> 20:12.377
Yumeko?

20:13.003 --> 20:14.713
That voice recorder...

20:14.796 --> 20:20.719
It was in there along with the fan letter,
as if to say, "Use this to threaten her."

20:21.428 --> 20:23.513
I wonder who put it there.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.224
I don't know.

20:25.807 --> 20:30.187
I put that letter here to burn it later.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.648
And I always lock the door tightly.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.568
I can't believe anyone could steal it
when we were here.

20:37.152 --> 20:40.739
In other words,
the one who did it had a master key.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.243
Please leave a message after the beep.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.122
Hello? President, you alive?

20:49.665 --> 20:53.168
Things are getting kind of fun here.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.420
You'd better come back soon,

20:55.504 --> 20:59.174
or who knows what will happen
to the school?

21:06.098 --> 21:09.434
"OF COURSE YOU CAN" BATTLE!

21:10.018 --> 21:12.020
That was "I'll Blackjack You"!

21:12.104 --> 21:14.731
Thank you, everyone!

21:14.815 --> 21:16.942
You're the best!

21:17.526 --> 21:21.071
I'm afraid that's all
for today's concert, but...

21:21.154 --> 21:22.990
What?

21:23.073 --> 21:27.577
Just like I said,
I'm about to pick a new member!

21:29.788 --> 21:31.873
It's finally time for Yumeko to appear.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.711
Wait, do we really have to stay
until the end?

21:35.794 --> 21:39.631
We didn't need you here anyway.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.760
I just got enough tickets for everyone
because Jabami- senpai  insisted.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.555
Saotome, these premium tickets

21:46.638 --> 21:49.182
aren't usually something
you're able to get.

21:49.266 --> 21:54.396
Do you know how hard I had to work
to get them from a fan club member?

21:54.479 --> 21:57.524
Fine. You already told me.

21:57.607 --> 22:01.486
I'll introduce you!
Or do you know her already?

22:01.570 --> 22:05.991
She's made quite a name for herself
since coming to school last month.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.660
Hyakkao Academy, Year Two, Flower Class,

22:08.744 --> 22:10.454
Yumeko Jabami!

22:18.295 --> 22:22.424
Jabami- senpai  looks so cute
in that outfit!

22:27.012 --> 22:29.389
Tell us how you're feeling, Yumeko!

22:31.058 --> 22:34.186
I've never had an opportunity like this,
so I'm nervous,

22:34.269 --> 22:39.941
- but I'll enjoy myself as much as I can.
- Okay! Here we go!

22:40.984 --> 22:44.654
It's time for the "Top Idol Match
'Of Course You Can' Battle!"

22:44.738 --> 22:46.782
Let's get started!

24:19.708 --> 24:23.211
- Yumemi! We love you!
- You can only win by dumb luck!

24:23.295 --> 24:26.882
- Just luck. That's a perfect game!
- Yumemi's future will be over.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.634
Thank you
for cheering me on till now.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.927
EPISODE 9: DREAMING GIRL
