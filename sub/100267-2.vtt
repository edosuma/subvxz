WEBVTT

00:18.394 --> 00:20.529
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome back to TSN's coverage

00:20.562 --> 00:22.731
of the National Senior
Hockey Championship

00:22.764 --> 00:24.666
brought to you
by BROdude Energy.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.135
I'm your host James Duthie.

00:26.168 --> 00:27.669
Joining me on the panel
for tonight's quiz

00:27.703 --> 00:31.373
are TSN insider Darren Dreger,
analyst Jeff O'Neil

00:31.407 --> 00:32.608
and the legend himself...

00:32.641 --> 00:34.075
Mr. Bob McKenzie.

00:34.110 --> 00:35.711
O‐Dog's a TSN analyst now?

00:35.744 --> 00:38.247
Isn't O‐Dog a TSN correspondent?

00:38.280 --> 00:41.217
Let's meet in the middle
at TSN personality

00:41.250 --> 00:42.784
and O‐dog, we'll start with you.

00:42.818 --> 00:45.587
If you could build
a team around one player

00:45.621 --> 00:47.189
in this tournament
final match‐up

00:47.223 --> 00:49.291
between Ontario's
Kerry County Eagles

00:49.325 --> 00:51.693
and Quebec's
Three Rivers Lakers,

00:51.727 --> 00:52.828
who would it be?

00:52.861 --> 00:56.765
Your options are A, number 74
Jones of Kerry County.

00:56.798 --> 01:00.702
B, number 68,
Reilly of Kerry County.

01:00.736 --> 01:04.406
C, number 10, Jacques‐Jean
of Trois Rivieres

01:04.440 --> 01:06.242
or go off the grid. O‐dog.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.309
I think it's undeniable that

01:07.343 --> 01:09.378
Jean‐Jacques Francois
Jacques‐Jean

01:09.411 --> 01:10.512
of the Three Rivers Lakers

01:10.546 --> 01:11.747
is your franchise player.

01:11.780 --> 01:15.084
This guy requires virtually
zero help to score goals.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.152
Sure, he's a one‐man show

01:16.185 --> 01:17.653
but when it comes
to winning championships,

01:17.686 --> 01:19.755
they don't ask how,
they ask how many.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.125
I mean let's get real here,
14 goals in 4 games

01:23.159 --> 01:24.560
with 11 unassisted.

01:24.593 --> 01:26.862
If Dregs goes with anyone else
on this question,

01:26.895 --> 01:29.698
consider this my application
for TSN insider.

01:29.731 --> 01:33.169
Spoken like a true...
personality. Dregs.

01:33.202 --> 01:34.670
It's a poor look for the panel

01:34.703 --> 01:37.306
having an amateur sandwiched
between the pros, James.

01:37.339 --> 01:40.209
The Three Rivers Lakers
have an elite goal scorer

01:40.242 --> 01:41.477
with NHL experience

01:41.510 --> 01:44.246
in Jean‐Jacques Francois
Jacques‐Jean,

01:44.280 --> 01:46.315
but if I'm building
a team around one player

01:46.348 --> 01:48.384
he's gotta be effective
in all three zones

01:48.417 --> 01:51.187
and that's the player
number 74 Jones

01:51.220 --> 01:52.721
of the Kerry County Eagles.

01:52.754 --> 01:55.891
As they say, fore‐check,
backcheck, pay check.

01:55.924 --> 01:58.694
He's a remarkable
plus 16 over 4 games

01:58.727 --> 02:01.263
with a balanced eight goals
and eight helpers.

02:01.297 --> 02:04.900
Offense wins games
but defense wins championships.

02:04.933 --> 02:06.468
When Jones is on the ice

02:06.502 --> 02:08.870
his opponents do not
and have not scored.

02:09.805 --> 02:12.408
Wow. Class is in session, O‐Dog.

02:12.441 --> 02:14.610
Is this a class
in hockey cliches?

02:14.643 --> 02:15.744
Bob McKenzie, your turn.

02:15.777 --> 02:18.714
I agree with Darren that
the work ethic is just not there

02:18.747 --> 02:22.918
for ex‐NHLer JJ Frankie JJ
of the Three Rivers Lakers.

02:22.951 --> 02:25.721
My franchise player,
number 68 Reilly

02:25.754 --> 02:27.356
of the Kerry County Eagles.

02:27.389 --> 02:29.258
This is a big player.
He loves big games.

02:29.291 --> 02:30.426
And on a senior hockey level

02:30.459 --> 02:33.629
I really believe Reilly belongs
in the same conversation

02:33.662 --> 02:36.265
as Blake Wheeler
or Gabriel Landeskog.

02:36.298 --> 02:40.469
He's a sandpaper player
with consistent point production

02:40.502 --> 02:41.937
and all the while
logging big minutes.

02:41.970 --> 02:43.839
If I'm building, he's my guy.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.275
No digs at Dregs or O‐Dog?

02:46.308 --> 02:47.876
As the senior member
of the panel, James,

02:47.909 --> 02:49.345
that's beneath me.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.346
All right. Fair enough.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.714
I'm going off the grid
for this one, gentlemen.

02:52.748 --> 02:54.883
Take Claude Lemieux
and Claude Giroux,

02:54.916 --> 02:56.485
wrap them up in one big ball,

02:56.518 --> 02:58.220
and you've got
the Kerry County Eagles'

02:58.254 --> 03:00.322
number 69 Shore.

03:00.356 --> 03:01.490
He's got the point totals

03:01.523 --> 03:03.492
to match line mates
Reilly and Jones

03:03.525 --> 03:05.794
but does far more
in the shutdown role

03:05.827 --> 03:07.396
to help his team win games.

03:07.429 --> 03:08.297
JEFF: You know James,

03:08.330 --> 03:09.731
for the first time
in panel history

03:09.765 --> 03:11.267
I'm going to change my answer.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.569
Shore is
a certified grit grinder.

03:13.602 --> 03:15.637
He's the Brad Marchand
of this tournament

03:15.671 --> 03:17.873
and the Eagles
aren't the Eagles without him.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.040
Dregs, your thoughts?

03:19.074 --> 03:22.278
Dino Ciccarelli comes to mind
as a comparable player,

03:22.311 --> 03:24.513
but Shore is too much
of a wild card

03:24.546 --> 03:25.747
to build a team around.

03:25.781 --> 03:27.816
You need discipline
in your leaders.

03:27.849 --> 03:28.884
Bob?

03:28.917 --> 03:30.919
James, I've covered
hockey for TSN

03:30.952 --> 03:33.422
throughout the careers
of Darcy Tucker, Matt Barnaby

03:33.455 --> 03:34.523
and Alex Burrows.

03:34.556 --> 03:36.792
And I believe Shore does
more talking on the ice

03:36.825 --> 03:37.826
than all three combined.

03:37.859 --> 03:40.429
Though he's got the ability
to take players

03:40.462 --> 03:41.897
and sometimes entire teams

03:41.930 --> 03:43.732
completely out of the game
mentally,

03:43.765 --> 03:45.767
he's a liability
and I wouldn't trust him

03:45.801 --> 03:46.935
in a leadership role.

03:46.968 --> 03:48.937
I'm with O‐Dog on this one, Bob.

03:48.970 --> 03:50.406
Don't care, James.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.940
Certified grit grinder, Darren.

03:51.973 --> 03:54.009
Go put it on a t‐shirt, Jeff.

03:54.042 --> 03:55.644
Well, folks, you've heard
from our panel

03:55.677 --> 03:57.246
of expert hockey minds.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.348
Please stay tuned
for tournament final coverage

03:59.381 --> 04:01.783
of the National
Senior Hockey Championship

04:01.817 --> 04:03.619
brought to you by BROdude Energy

04:03.919 --> 04:04.920
on TSN.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.988
(APPLAUSE)

04:07.022 --> 04:09.225
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:14.496 --> 04:15.497
Say, how's Lovyna Dyck?

04:16.832 --> 04:18.367
She's Lovyna Dyck.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.535
She's Lovyna Dyck?

04:19.568 --> 04:21.503
Oh, she's Lovyna Dyck.

04:21.903 --> 04:23.004
She's...

04:24.473 --> 04:25.374
Loving a dick?

04:25.407 --> 04:26.875
Dary! What on earth
would make you think

04:26.908 --> 04:28.377
I would say
such a horrible thing?

04:28.410 --> 04:29.345
I don't know.

04:29.378 --> 04:31.613
Lovyna Dyck is a proud woman
set in her ways.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.782
And while I am a man
of traditional values,

04:33.815 --> 04:35.517
I draw the line at primitive.

04:35.551 --> 04:37.553
Yeah, 'nappers
are a wee bit square, eh?

04:37.586 --> 04:39.455
They're all kinds of L7.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.489
Did you get a smooch
out of her?

04:41.090 --> 04:42.491
No.

04:42.524 --> 04:43.659
And that ship has sailed.

04:43.692 --> 04:45.527
I broke things off with her.

04:45.561 --> 04:47.896
Besides, it's impolite
to kiss and tell.

04:47.929 --> 04:49.798
Yeah, but you could tell
one person,

04:49.831 --> 04:50.766
like a good buddy.

04:50.799 --> 04:52.768
Bend enough and you'll break,
good buddy.

04:52.801 --> 04:53.969
I admire your discipline.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.572
Well, if you stand for nothing,
you'll fall for anything.

04:56.605 --> 04:58.607
Do you believe in ghosts?

04:58.640 --> 05:00.876
There is one girl
that I kiss and told you about.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.077
I don't.

05:02.111 --> 05:03.545
Yeah, you remember that girl

05:03.579 --> 05:04.780
who stuck her fingers
up to my bum?

05:06.515 --> 05:08.417
You mean the one
who tapped on your backdoor?

05:08.450 --> 05:10.319
The one who played Crokinole
in my basement.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.953
The one who had
the keyless entry to your trunk?

05:11.987 --> 05:14.055
The one who tested
my wind conditions.

05:14.090 --> 05:15.324
Sure I do.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.392
She's back for the summer.

05:16.425 --> 05:17.693
‐Is that what she is?
‐Mmm‐hmm.

05:18.827 --> 05:20.662
She finishing up
her Kinesiology degree

05:20.696 --> 05:22.464
with a focus on massage therapy.

05:22.498 --> 05:24.700
Whoo, buddy!

05:24.733 --> 05:26.568
She asked me if I wanted
to go for a walk,

05:26.602 --> 05:28.036
and I said no, 'cause I don't
wanna go for a walk.

05:28.069 --> 05:29.938
Because I just
finished dating a Mennonite

05:29.971 --> 05:32.040
and that's all you can
fucking do is go for walks.

05:32.073 --> 05:33.442
Maybe you should take her
for ice cream.

05:33.475 --> 05:34.510
I said I wasn't
gonna leave here

05:34.543 --> 05:35.611
till my buddy
was feeling better,

05:35.644 --> 05:37.946
so she said she was gonna
come by and sit for a bit.

05:37.979 --> 05:39.481
You should find a good place
for a stump hump?

05:39.515 --> 05:41.483
I'll probably find a good place
for a bumper dump.

05:44.086 --> 05:45.754
Do you think Wayne's in there
thinking about Marie‐Fred?

05:47.423 --> 05:49.024
Yeah.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.992
But you know,
once a girl cheats, it's over.

05:51.026 --> 05:52.094
No exceptions.

05:52.128 --> 05:53.061
Yeah.

05:53.095 --> 05:54.796
Bend enough
and you'll break, good buddy.

05:54.830 --> 05:56.565
If you stand for nothing,
you'll fall for anything.

06:00.869 --> 06:02.438
MISS FIRE:
General Public?

06:02.471 --> 06:03.505
GENERAL PUBLIC:
Miss Fire.

06:03.539 --> 06:05.441
MISS FIRE:
Private Sector is some upset.

06:05.474 --> 06:08.076
He didn't get that part
in Going West he auditioned for.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.145
GENERAL PUBLIC:
You're kidding.

06:09.178 --> 06:10.879
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:10.912 --> 06:12.781
MISS FIRE:
He's pretty near inconsolable,

06:12.814 --> 06:14.816
so I was thinking 'cause...

06:14.850 --> 06:16.818
He looks up to you so much.

06:16.852 --> 06:18.854
Well, I was thinking
you could...

06:18.887 --> 06:20.489
I don't know, go over there

06:20.522 --> 06:22.391
and maybe just give him
a little hug.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.860
GENERAL PUBLIC: Give him a little hug?
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

06:24.893 --> 06:27.663
MISS FIRE: Yes, General Public,
just give him a little hug.

06:27.696 --> 06:28.930
That's what I said.

06:28.964 --> 06:31.066
GENERAL PUBLIC: Miss Fire,
if I wanted to hold a fruit

06:31.100 --> 06:32.701
I'd go apple picking.

06:32.734 --> 06:34.136
MISS FIRE:
Excuse me,

06:34.170 --> 06:36.738
seriously please, and thank you!

06:36.772 --> 06:38.540
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:43.479 --> 06:44.580
What'd you guys do this weekend?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.448
‐Fucked some dudes up the ass.
‐You?

06:46.482 --> 06:47.516
Stewart.

06:47.549 --> 06:48.717
‐Stewart?
‐Update.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.486
BOTH: Roald.

06:50.519 --> 06:51.787
As you've been made aware,

06:51.820 --> 06:54.123
when Stewart enlisted our help
in getting yoked

06:54.156 --> 06:56.192
we presented him
with four goals to achieve.

06:56.225 --> 06:57.426
‐Yoked?
‐Jacked.

06:58.727 --> 07:00.096
Stewart came to us not yoked.

07:00.129 --> 07:00.996
Mmm, Stewart.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.132
But upon achieving goals
one through four,

07:03.165 --> 07:05.134
we as fitness gurus...

07:05.167 --> 07:06.001
Fitness specimens.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.769
‐Fitness examples.
‐Fitness exemplars.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.738
Fitness exemplifications.

07:09.771 --> 07:11.573
(BOTH INHALING)

07:11.607 --> 07:14.143
We as fitness exhibits
can confidently

07:14.176 --> 07:16.578
and enthusiastically
exercise our authority

07:16.612 --> 07:18.714
in deeming him officially yoked.

07:18.747 --> 07:19.815
‐Just say jacked.
‐Okay.

07:19.848 --> 07:21.083
How them goals coming?

07:21.117 --> 07:23.185
Goal number one.
Add ten pounds of muscle mass.

07:23.219 --> 07:24.453
Goal achieved.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.521
Goal number two.
Bench press.

07:25.554 --> 07:27.189
Three sets of four reps,
200 pounds.

07:27.223 --> 07:28.690
‐Goal achieved.
‐Goal number three.

07:28.724 --> 07:31.560
Deadlifts. Three sets
of four reps, 200 pounds.

07:31.593 --> 07:33.095
‐Goal achieved.
‐Goal number four.

07:33.129 --> 07:36.098
Squats. Three sets
of four reps, 200lbs.

07:36.132 --> 07:38.467
‐Goal achieved.
‐Whoo‐Yay!

07:38.500 --> 07:40.001
‐So, he's shredded?
‐No, he's jacked.

07:40.035 --> 07:41.537
‐Cut?
‐You mean circumcised?

07:41.570 --> 07:43.071
‐No, jacked.
‐Same thing.

07:43.105 --> 07:44.706
They are absolutely
not the same thing.

07:44.740 --> 07:45.907
What's the difference?

07:45.941 --> 07:46.942
Roald.

07:49.578 --> 07:50.746
‐Brad Pitt.
‐Shredded.

07:50.779 --> 07:52.081
‐Tom Hardy.
‐Jacked.

07:52.114 --> 07:53.582
‐Zac Efron.
‐Shredded.

07:53.615 --> 07:55.084
‐The Rock.
‐Jacked.

07:55.117 --> 07:56.152
‐Get it?
‐Got it.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.619
RON: Good.
STEWART: Roald.

08:00.156 --> 08:01.157
Stewart?

08:01.957 --> 08:02.958
Lifting belt.

08:03.825 --> 08:04.893
Check.

08:04.926 --> 08:06.061
Chalk?

08:06.095 --> 08:07.129
Check.

08:07.163 --> 08:08.197
Compression pants?

08:10.199 --> 08:11.533
Check.

08:13.302 --> 08:15.003
Okay, he is cut.

08:17.106 --> 08:18.474
Sure you wanna do this?

08:19.708 --> 08:21.076
Can confirm.

08:21.110 --> 08:22.611
‐Katy?
‐Bonnie.

08:22.644 --> 08:23.845
Don't kick a dead horse.

08:23.879 --> 08:24.913
‐Bonnie?
‐Katy.

08:24.946 --> 08:26.115
Bend enough and you'll break.

08:27.683 --> 08:29.551
Stand for nothing,
and you'll fall for anything.

08:37.093 --> 08:38.527
Welcome back,
ladies and gentlemen,

08:38.560 --> 08:40.762
Warm‐ups are underway
at the Kerry County Arena

08:40.796 --> 08:43.299
for the National Senior
Hockey Championship

08:43.332 --> 08:46.302
and, Tessa, I know you have
something special

08:46.335 --> 08:48.104
planned for our audience
at home.

08:48.137 --> 08:49.571
That's right, Kate.

08:49.605 --> 08:52.174
The game of hockey
has a longstanding tradition

08:52.208 --> 08:54.643
of trash talk or chirping,
if you will,

08:54.676 --> 08:57.213
And this tournament
has been no exception,

08:57.246 --> 08:58.980
and while we could
leave it a mystery

08:59.014 --> 08:59.948
for the folks at home,

08:59.981 --> 09:02.618
no, we here at TSN
have decided to partner

09:02.651 --> 09:05.821
in this tournament's final game
with a young lady named Tanis

09:05.854 --> 09:08.290
who has mic'd up
the Kerry County Eagles

09:08.324 --> 09:11.760
and decided to combine
her coverage with ours.

09:12.328 --> 09:13.729
Should be good.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.796
Tanis, welcome.

09:14.830 --> 09:17.666
Tell us how this all came to be.

09:19.835 --> 09:21.570
(GIGGLES)

09:21.603 --> 09:23.272
This is so cool!

09:23.305 --> 09:25.307
I seen you win a gold medal
in Vancouver in 2010.

09:25.341 --> 09:26.808
Aw, thank you.

09:26.842 --> 09:28.910
And, Kate, I follow you
on Instagram.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.045
You've got a great ass.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.716
So anyways, my little cousins,
they love hockey

09:34.750 --> 09:37.052
but what they love even more
is those videos on YouTube

09:37.086 --> 09:38.287
of NHL players mic'd out.

09:39.020 --> 09:40.222
Mic'd up?

09:40.256 --> 09:41.290
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

09:41.323 --> 09:43.024
But they love the Eagles

09:43.058 --> 09:44.893
so to keep them interested
in the game

09:44.926 --> 09:46.662
I decided to provide them
with videos

09:46.695 --> 09:49.030
of their favorite players
mic'd out.

09:49.064 --> 09:50.166
Mic'd out it is.

09:50.199 --> 09:51.032
Commendable, Tanis.

09:51.066 --> 09:52.768
Kids in sports
stay off the streets.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.170
I love your hair too, Kate.

09:54.203 --> 09:56.105
(GIGGLES)

09:56.138 --> 09:57.673
Oh! Can I shout out my crew?

09:57.706 --> 09:58.807
Yeah, sure. Have at it.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.742
Well, they're right here
so, come on!

to ice level now

10:12.821 --> 10:14.923
to our first serving
of mic'd up.

10:15.357 --> 10:16.392
Mic'd out.

10:16.425 --> 10:17.693
Yeah, mic'd out.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.731
SHORESY: Throw on some fuckin'
smoked meat, Frankie.

10:22.764 --> 10:24.266
I'm gonna be
in your kitchen all night.

10:31.072 --> 10:33.041
Don't say anything
about the fingers in the bum.

10:33.074 --> 10:34.110
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

10:34.143 --> 10:36.077
‐Hi, Daniel!
‐Ellen.

10:39.415 --> 10:40.949
This is Daryl.

10:40.982 --> 10:42.984
‐Hi.
‐Hello. (GIGGLES)

10:47.189 --> 10:48.690
Daryl.

10:48.724 --> 10:50.092
You can call me Dary.

10:50.126 --> 10:52.828
Okay, Dary.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.630
Did Dan tell you
I put a finger up his butt?

10:55.731 --> 10:56.832
No.

10:56.865 --> 10:57.933
Dan?

10:57.966 --> 10:59.968
You didn't tell Daryl
I put a finger in your butt?

11:00.001 --> 11:01.103
No.

11:01.137 --> 11:02.438
Why? What's the big deal?

11:02.471 --> 11:04.306
BOTH: 'Cause you're not
expose'ta kiss and tell.

11:04.340 --> 11:07.109
You never had a finger
up your butt then, Dary?

11:07.143 --> 11:09.845
Which means you've definitely
never had a tongue in your butt.

11:09.878 --> 11:10.912
Me neither.

11:10.946 --> 11:12.013
Why not?

11:12.047 --> 11:13.215
'Cause that's outdoor.

11:13.249 --> 11:14.850
Ah, you don't know
what you're missing.

11:15.284 --> 11:16.318
That's fine.

11:16.352 --> 11:18.287
The male G‐spot is up there.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.256
‐What's a G‐spot?
‐An old wives tale.

11:20.289 --> 11:22.358
If you want to find out,
stick your finger up there.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.692
Stick my finger up where?

11:23.725 --> 11:24.926
Stick your finger up your ass.

11:26.928 --> 11:27.896
What do you mean,
like two‐knuckler?

11:27.929 --> 11:31.433
Trust me. When you've found it,
you'll know.

11:31.467 --> 11:33.702
Dan, let's go for a walk.
It's a beautiful day.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.237
Okay.

11:35.271 --> 11:36.972
Maybe just a short walk.

11:43.145 --> 11:46.182
I heard the TSN guys think
you're better players than me.

11:46.215 --> 11:48.350

you look like
you love a good slice.

12:18.147 --> 12:19.014
Did you get axed from the show

12:19.047 --> 12:21.250
and just start hammering
slices or what?

12:22.118 --> 12:23.185
If the Cup was a slice,

12:23.219 --> 12:24.453

this time

Will you marry me, Miss Fire?

20:35.744 --> 20:36.712
(AUDIENCE GASPING)

20:36.745 --> 20:40.682
MISS FIRE: Excuse me,
seriously please, and thank you!

20:40.716 --> 20:43.319
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

20:43.352 --> 20:46.021
Yes! Yes, I will,
General Public.

20:46.054 --> 20:47.856
PRIVATE SECTOR: Miss Fire,
I heard you screaming

20:47.889 --> 20:48.957
and I came running
just as fast

20:48.990 --> 20:50.092
as my little legs
could carry me.

20:50.126 --> 20:51.827
GENERAL PUBLIC: You're spoiling
our big moment,

20:51.860 --> 20:52.894
you tootie‐fruity!

20:52.928 --> 20:54.896
MISS FIRE:
General Public!

20:54.930 --> 20:56.565
GENERAL PUBLIC:
Right. Uh...

20:56.598 --> 20:58.800
You'll have to excuse me,
Private Sector.

20:59.535 --> 21:01.337
Seriously.

21:01.370 --> 21:03.004
Please, and thank you.

21:03.038 --> 21:06.007
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

21:15.984 --> 21:17.018
Good buddy?

21:17.052 --> 21:19.355
If she cheats, it's over.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.989
No exceptions.

21:21.022 --> 21:22.991
Bend enough and you'll break,
big brother.

21:23.024 --> 21:24.660
Yup.

21:24.693 --> 21:27.729
If you stand for nothing,
you'll fall for anything.

21:27.763 --> 21:29.030
Can confirm.

21:29.998 --> 21:30.999
So?

21:32.734 --> 21:33.902
So, pitter‐patter.

21:35.537 --> 21:36.605
Let's get at her.
