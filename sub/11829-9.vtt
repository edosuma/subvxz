Previously on "The Secret Life
of the American Teenager"...

00:02.500 --> 00:04.700
Thank you so much for
letting me stay with you.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.800
I think if I keep picturing her,
she'll maybe show up here again.

00:07.900 --> 00:11.300
If you're gonna be involved
with Amy and the baby,

00:11.300 --> 00:12.700
I don't think
I can see you anymore.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.600
She's upset because I've decided
to dothe responsible thing.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.800
I wanna find my father.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
My mom's here.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.300
She doesn't know
you're not living here.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.500
Adoption is not an option.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.600
I should've told you.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.300
It's kind of embarrassing having Alzheimer's
when you can rember it.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.800
I'm really gonna miss you.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.400
I'm not going anywhere.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.400
You know,we don'thave to go tonight

00:57.400 --> 00:59.800
if you don't want us to.
I don't have to,anyway.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.100
No,you should go.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.200
You should see your dad.

01:02.200 --> 01:02.800
Why?

01:02.900 --> 01:05.200
Because he's your dad,
and he asked to see you.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.900
and Amy,you need to talk
to him about schools,OK,

01:07.900 --> 01:09.200
because we have to make a decision.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.700
I don't know what I wanna do
about school,other than not going.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.900
Well,That's not really an option.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Look,I don't understand why I can't
call in sick for five months.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.100
Me,neither,but you can't.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.300
So

01:21.200 --> 01:22.700
Do you know where he's taking you?

01:24.300 --> 01:25.000
Where?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.700
Did he tell you not to tell me?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.800
OK,you guys have fun.OK?

01:31.100 --> 01:32.200
I'm gonna have fun.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.100
I mean I love having
this house to myself.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.500
We're just gonna hang out.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.700
But hang out where?

01:36.700 --> 01:38.000
You don't even wanna leave the house.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.600
At his place.You know.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.700
He has a place now.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.000
Oh.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
He has a place now.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.600
Yeah,but I'm sure
it's a real dump.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.600
It better be.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.300
Thanks,fellas.
This was a really good idea.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.600
I don't know why you volunteered,

02:03.600 --> 02:04.700
But thank you.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.000
I just want you to be able
to see your daughters.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.600
Oh,and don't tell my mom
I let you do this.

02:09.699 --> 02:10.300
Are you kidding?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.900
No. She'd kill me especially
since you dumped her.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
That's a good point.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.700
Oh,Listen up,
I'll be outta here by midnight,

02:15.700 --> 02:17.100
and my guys will waiting to
bring the stuff back in,

02:17.100 --> 02:18.100
I promise,all right?

02:18.200 --> 02:20.000
And I owe you big time.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.100
See ya.

02:27.700 --> 02:28.900
Here goes nothin'.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.000
The Secret Life of the American Teenager 109

03:55.000 --> 03:56.200
It's great,Dad.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.600
Yeah,except for the fact that
you got one bed for the two of us.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.400
Strange,with you owning
a furniture store and all.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.600
It came furnished.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.800
It's a sublet kinda thing.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
You konw,I don't wanna sign
a long-term lease

04:08.000 --> 04:09.800
until I know what happens
with your mother and me.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.300
It's month-to-month.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.100
Besides,I thought it'd be fun if

04:13.200 --> 04:15.200
you konw you girls slept together
like you did when you were kids.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.100
Yeah,Dad,great.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.200
We're not spending the night.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.500
We never agreed to that.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.399
I know,but sometime you might want to.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.400
Doubt it.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.200
So you guys wanna get some pizzaor
something? You wanna go out?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.600
No,I definitely don't wanna go out.

04:28.900 --> 04:32.100
I don't wanna run into anybody
I know from school or band.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.400
Amy,you're with me now.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.600
If anybody looks at you or
says anything to you,

04:35.800 --> 04:37.300
I'll stick a rocket in their pocket

04:37.300 --> 04:38.400
and send 'em to the moon.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.700
Thanks,Dad.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.700
I appreciate your support.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.800
Do you mind if I call Ben?

04:44.300 --> 04:45.300
Oh,you and Ben,you're still...

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
Yeah,we're still...

04:48.000 --> 04:48.900
Do you mind?

04:49.100 --> 04:51.300
No,go ahead. That's good.I like Ben.

04:55.900 --> 04:56.600
What?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So whose place is this,
your girlfriend's?

04:59.500 --> 05:00.100
What?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.200
Dad,it smells like perfume.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.400
Well,obviously girls used to live here.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.900
That's a girl's room back there.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.400
How do you know
it's not a man's perfume you're smelling?

05:09.500 --> 05:10.900
Maybe it's just me you're smelling.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.700
I think we all know your smell.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.100
What kind of pizza you want?

05:14.200 --> 05:15.300
I'm not hungry.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.300
I can't go anywhere.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.700
I don't wanna go anywhere.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.200
What about if I came over there?

05:21.300 --> 05:23.400
I'd love it if you came over here,

05:23.900 --> 05:25.500
but you konw,it's kinda creepy.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.200
Feels like I'm in
someone else's home.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.600
So is that a yes?Is it OK?

05:29.900 --> 05:32.800
Look,Ben,I'm dyingto see you,
I really am.It's just...

05:33.400 --> 05:34.900
I don't know how this thing works.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.900
I'm pretty sure Ashley and I
belong to my dad tonight.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.400
You belong to me.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.300
We belong to each other.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.500
I have to see you.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.200
I feel the same way.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.200
I have to be here for my dad.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.700
I see my mom every day.I just...

05:48.500 --> 05:49.800
I have to at least
spend one night with him.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.300
I really wanna see you.
It's just that...

05:52.400 --> 05:53.600
I don't know.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.000
Come on. Ask your dad.
He won't mind.

05:56.100 --> 05:56.800
I can't.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.500
I don't think I can share
my time with him with you.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.700
Besides,we're supposed to talk about
my plans,you konw

06:01.700 --> 06:03.300
what I'msupposed to
do about school stuff.

06:03.500 --> 06:06.200
But your dad likes me.
I like him.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.800
And we both love you.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.900
I miss you. Ha-ha.
I really miss you.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.100
Then ask him.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.900
You konw it wouldn't be fair to Ashley.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.800
What wouldn't be fair?

06:17.100 --> 06:18.900
Um,if Ben came over.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.600
No one cares. Dad wants to know
what kind of pizza you want.

06:22.700 --> 06:23.900
Sausage and peppers.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.000
Hey,I'm on my way.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.200
I'll ask for your address
when I pick up the pizza.OK,bye.

06:31.700 --> 06:32.700
Well?

06:38.500 --> 06:40.700
Hey. I didn't know
you were coming over here.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.300
Um,listen, I gotta go
drop off a pizza to Amy.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.200
She's at her dad's condo,but,uh,

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
make yourself at home.

06:46.700 --> 06:47.900
Oh,Maybe I'll go with you.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.100
Uh,well,um...

06:50.100 --> 06:51.600
Alice had to go to hergreat-aunt's.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.600
- It's hergreat-aunt's birthday.
- Oh

06:53.700 --> 06:55.000
Um. Why didn't you go with her?

06:55.200 --> 06:56.100
I didn't want to.

06:56.300 --> 06:58.500
Don't you usually go to
all the family parties?

06:58.600 --> 06:59.600
Yeah,usually.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.300
Why not this one?

07:02.200 --> 07:03.800
If you don't want me to go
with you,that's OK.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
I can just go home.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.200
No,no. It's not that
I don't want you to go with me.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.900
It's just that this is
Amy's first visit with her dad

07:09.900 --> 07:11.300
since her dad and her mom split up,

07:11.300 --> 07:14.100
and I probably shouldn't even
be going over there,so...

07:14.300 --> 07:15.300
Is everything OK?

07:15.700 --> 07:17.200
Yeah,I'm OK.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.100
No,something's wrong.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.700
Yeah,something,
but we can talk tomorrow.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.700
You go to Amy's dad's,have fun,
don't worry about me.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.700
Oh,OK. Yeah,
I really don't have time to talk.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.000
I gotta go get the pizza.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.000
You wanna come with?

07:32.100 --> 07:33.300
Yeah,thanks.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.800
I just wish you had told me that
this is what we were gonna do.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I told my parents
we were getting pizza.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.500
We got pizza.
It's in the back seat.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.900
I know, but I didn't tell
them the whole truth,

07:48.900 --> 07:51.600
and I've already been ina lot of trouble
for not telling them the whole truth.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.500
You think if we would've
told 'em we were going

07:53.500 --> 07:56.000
to look for my father,
they would've let you come with me?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.700
I kinda doubt it.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.200
But maybe my dad would've come
with us to do this.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.400
My dad's really good at confronting
people in difficult situations.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.400
Thought your parents were out
on their corny date night.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.600
I don't think it's corny.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.400
I think it's kinda romantic.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
Please.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.300
Date night's for people
who aren't having sex.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.200
Oh,my parents have plenty of sex.

08:17.900 --> 08:18.800
How do you know?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.100
I'm just assuming.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.400
Where's your brother?
Where's Tom?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.800
He's home alone.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.100
It's another reason why I don't feel
comfortable staying out too late.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.799
I mean he has been home
by himself before,but still...

08:34.400 --> 08:36.400
I told my parents
we wouldn't be gone too long.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.799
I just wanna see
what the guy looks like.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.600
You konw I'm not gonna cause
a big scene or anything.

08:47.100 --> 08:47.600
What?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.300
What time can I see you?

08:49.900 --> 08:50.900
I told you,I'm busy.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.100
Come on,Adrian. I can't go
this long without you,

08:54.500 --> 08:55.600
or someone.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.700
Thanks. I'm sure you mean
that as a compliment.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.500
Look,I told you,
I can't tonight.

09:01.700 --> 09:02.600
Why not?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.200
I just can't,OK?

09:04.600 --> 09:07.500
Oh,and don't bother calling Grace.
She's with me.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.500
Good night.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.200
Ricky.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.700
I,uh,talked to Jack earlier.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.000
Actually,I've talked to him all week
about you.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.100
OK,I'm not sure
I'm comfortable with that,

09:28.100 --> 09:29.300
but thank you for telling me.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.100
Of course I'm gonna tell you.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.000
Because we're friends,right?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.100
And Jack and I are friends.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.100
Right.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.500
I just don't get why he can
call you, but he can't call me.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.000
'Cause he's tired of being rejected,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.900
and he's waiting for you
to call him.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.000
The guy is madly in love
with you.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
Call him,take him back.

09:50.700 --> 09:54.100
I don't know.
Just doesn't feel right now.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.800
Too much time has passed.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.300
Is that the problem?

09:57.600 --> 10:00.000
Too much time has passed?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.900
Or is the problem
that you like Ricky?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.500
I know,you like Ricky,

10:08.900 --> 10:13.500
But you know I like Ricky,
and like I told you the first time I met you

10:13.600 --> 10:15.500
We're having sex.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.300
I know that,and I'm not
interested in having sex with Ricky,

10:19.300 --> 10:21.800
and he's not interested in
having sex with me.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.900
We're just friends.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Come on,Grace.
Ricky does not have friends.

10:28.400 --> 10:32.100
Ricky makes friends with girls
he wants to have sex with.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.600
Ricky and I are just friends,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.600
and he's not gonna try to
have sex with me.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.700
Mm-hmm,I'm sure
that's the same thing

10:38.700 --> 10:41.300
Amy Juergens was thinking the night
she had sex with him.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
Poor Amy.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.900
No. Poor Ricky,poor baby,

10:48.200 --> 10:49.600
not poor Amy.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.100
A girl should know
how to take care of herself.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.300
How hard is it not to get pregnant?

10:55.400 --> 10:56.300
I don't know.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.100
Then stay away from Ricky.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.500
Hello?

11:10.700 --> 11:12.900
Hey,what are you doing tonight?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.300
Who is this?

11:14.500 --> 11:15.900
You know who it is.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.200
Why are you calling me?

11:18.800 --> 11:20.800
I just need someone to talk to,
Lauren.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.100
About what?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.600
About what else -
Amy and the baby.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.300
I have to talk to someone,

11:26.300 --> 11:28.300
someone who has her best interest at heart.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.800
I'm not gonna talk to you.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.200
Why not?

11:31.500 --> 11:33.000
You didn't seem
to have any trouble talking to me

11:33.000 --> 11:35.200
last week
when you wanted to talk to me.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.400
Now I wanna talk to you.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.300
I'm busy.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.500
Doing what?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.100
You're not doing anything,
are you?

11:42.400 --> 11:43.200
Yes,I am.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.300
Can we go out and just talk,
please?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.800
You're out of your mind,
you know that?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.200
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.000
I thought you were
going out with Jason.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.600
Oh,I am. I just didn't tell my dad.

12:06.700 --> 12:07.900
Oh.Why not?

12:08.100 --> 12:09.600
I don't know. I like it
better this way.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.700
You konw he just dropped me off.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.100
He thinks I'm spending
the night like always.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.500
So,where's Jason taking you?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.500
To the movies,
then to get a pizza.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.600
That swanky pizza joint
is donating money to the school

12:19.600 --> 12:22.000
for every student who buys
a pizza tonight,so...

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
Pizza and a movie.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.200
Original.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.600
You can't go. No offense.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.200
I don't wanna go.No offense.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.000
Are you sure?

12:30.200 --> 12:30.800
I'm sure.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
Do you have any friends
you could fix her up with?

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
Her? Uh,no,I don't.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.900
I can get my own date.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.300
Really?

12:38.700 --> 12:39.500
I can.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.400
OK.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.800
Well,you know what?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.200
I will help you
find a date next week.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.300
You got me a date.
It's the least I can do.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
I said I can get my own date.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.500
When I'm ready,OK?

12:51.600 --> 12:52.400
OK.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.200
OK. Uh,we should go.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.000
We don't wanna wait around
till she finds a date,

12:56.000 --> 12:57.400
'cause that could take years.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.400
As much as I appreciate the pity,

12:59.400 --> 13:02.800
I don't think either one of you
have been on an official date,have you?

13:03.600 --> 13:05.500
Yeah,so go. Get outta here.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.600
I got things to do.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.800
Well,good night.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.200
Good night.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.500
Good night.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.100
Who is it?

13:28.300 --> 13:29.700
Leo Boykewich.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.600
I heard you were home alone.

13:36.700 --> 13:37.800
Thought I'd drop by.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.100
Maybe we could talk.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.600
I'm Leo,Ben's dad.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.200
Anne,Amy's mom.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.900
This a bad time?

13:45.100 --> 13:48.200
No,no. Come in,please.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.900
I,uh,I should've called first,at least.
I apologize.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.000
Oh,no. I apologize
for looking like this.

14:01.500 --> 14:05.500
I'd go change and clean myself
up a bit,but,um...

14:06.200 --> 14:07.800
I don't really feel like it
'cause...

14:08.100 --> 14:11.100
Because your mom just got
diagnosed with Alzheimer's

14:11.100 --> 14:12.600
and you and your husband
are having problems

14:12.600 --> 14:16.100
and your lovely daughter has gotten
herself into a little bit of trouble

14:16.100 --> 14:19.700
and the girls are going to visit their dad
for the first time since you split up

14:19.700 --> 14:23.400
and because that wine
doesn't go with that cereal.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.700
Aw... it's OK.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.400
Everything's gonna be all right.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.000
So how do you like the pizza,
Mr. Juergens?

14:41.400 --> 14:42.200
You can call me George.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.100
Could you pass me another slice,George?

14:44.100 --> 14:46.500
Not you. You call me Mr. Juergens.

14:46.900 --> 14:47.800
Mr. Juergens.

14:47.900 --> 14:48.600
That's more like it.

14:48.700 --> 14:49.500
Dad...

14:50.000 --> 14:51.200
He's kidding.

14:51.700 --> 14:52.400
Oh.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.800
It's good pizza.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.800
Oh,yeah,it's Fianno's.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.700
Fianno's? Where's Fianno's?
I never heard of that.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.200
It's a place my dad
likes to go to.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.100
He actually arranged this thing with the
school where they donate money to the school

15:02.100 --> 15:03.800
for any business
they bring in tonight.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.200
I should do that with my store.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.900
Donate money for any sales
the students bring in.

15:06.900 --> 15:07.700
That's a good idea.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.600
We should bring a piece to Ashley.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.800
What's your name again?

15:12.600 --> 15:13.700
It's Henry,Dad.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.000
I'm just kidding.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.900
Why you so down,Harry?
What's up?

15:17.100 --> 15:18.400
Girlfriend problems.

15:19.000 --> 15:19.500
Thanks.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.000
Girlfriend break up with you?

15:21.200 --> 15:22.300
Did she?

15:22.600 --> 15:24.100
No. No.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.600
You ever meet Amy's sister?

15:27.900 --> 15:28.700
No.

15:29.100 --> 15:32.400
Oh. She is the shyest little girl

15:32.400 --> 15:34.000
just a couple years younger t
han you three

15:34.200 --> 15:38.600
but the sweetest,nicest cherub
you'd ever wanna meet.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.200
You konw when she heard you
and Ben were coming over,

15:40.200 --> 15:42.200
she ran to the back room
like a scared little kitten.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.200
Hey,do me a favor.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.200
Would you bring my little angel
a slice of pizza.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.700
Oh. OK.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.800
Thanks,Harry.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.200
What do you want?

16:11.400 --> 16:13.300
Your dad asked me
to bring you some pizza.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.600
Put it down,then back out of the room
with your hands over your head.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.000
No.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.700
I won't back out of the room
with my hands over my head,

16:29.100 --> 16:30.800
because I'm tired of people
telling me what to do

16:30.800 --> 16:33.700
and when to do it
and when not to do it.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.300
I'm a man,damn it.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.800
Well,in that case,ou can stay.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
Well,OK.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.700
Who is it?

16:44.900 --> 16:46.800
- It's Ricky.
- Ricky?

16:50.100 --> 16:51.400
Hey,buddy.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.400
Hey. Is Grace home?

16:54.400 --> 16:57.200
No. She's out with Adrian.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.800
Really? Your parents
let her go out with Adrian?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.000
Maybe I could wait for her.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.700
I have a friend coming over.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.200
You have a friend
coming over? Like a date?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.099
Good for you.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.400
Do you have any idea
where Grace and Adrian went?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.700
Maybe they are at Adrian's house.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.500
Yeah,maybe they are.
Thanks.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.300
Maybe you should write
him a letter first.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.000
Maybe.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.800
Or maybe you should call him and see
how he feels about meeting you.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.700
Maybe.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.500
Adrian,I'm sorry. I don't feel
comfortable doing this.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
I think we should go.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.600
I've waited 16 years for this.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.600
You can't wait another few minutes?

17:54.900 --> 17:55.900
OK.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.300
What exactly are we waiting for?

18:00.500 --> 18:02.900
I just wanna
see the guy,OK?

18:04.500 --> 18:07.000
How do you even know
it's the right guy?

18:48.700 --> 18:50.000
Finally!!

18:50.100 --> 18:51.700
Sorry,Tom. Busy night.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.700
The high school gets credit for every pizza
any student orders tonight.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.600
It's been a little crazy.

18:55.700 --> 18:56.600
Yeah.

18:57.900 --> 18:58.900
Here you go.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Tom,that's a lot of money.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.200
You want more?

19:02.400 --> 19:04.700
Oh,no. I'm just saying,
careful with your cash.

19:04.900 --> 19:05.900
Thanks for the tip.

19:05.900 --> 19:09.300
Ha-ha. Thanks for the tip.
I get it. Funny.

19:10.700 --> 19:11.800
Good Night,Tom.

19:21.700 --> 19:22.400
Hello.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.700
Hi,Tom. It's me. I'm checking
to see how you are.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.100
I'm fine.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.100
Do you need me to come home?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.000
No.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.300
Are you sure?

19:29.300 --> 19:30.600
Yes.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.900
I just thought you might be
scared there all by yourself.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.200
No.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.900
He says he's OK,
but I don't know.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.200
Look,I know this is
really hard for you,

19:44.200 --> 19:48.100
but what if the the guy sees us
sitting outside his house?

19:59.900 --> 20:01.000
Feel better now?

20:01.700 --> 20:02.500
Yeah.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.600
Haven't really had anyone to talk to.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.800
I mean,I don't know.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.000
What are we gonna do,Anne?

20:09.300 --> 20:10.300
They're in love.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.700
It's wonderful
they're in love,

20:12.700 --> 20:14.700
but they're
just 15 years old.

20:15.000 --> 20:15.900
It's complicated.

20:16.100 --> 20:16.900
Or not.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.900
She's gonna be a mother.
We accept that,Ben and me.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.200
He wants her in his life
and I want her in his life.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.600
She's a nice girl.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.800
Thank you.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.100
I think I'm just still in shock.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.300
I don't understand it.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.100
It seems so unlikely
that she would...

20:32.100 --> 20:33.400
Have sex,yeah.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.100
I think most of us feel that way
about our children,

20:36.300 --> 20:37.500
our teenagers.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.200
I spoke to the counselor
at school.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.200
Marc Molina,yeah. Nice guy.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.300
He said there's
an extension class

20:43.300 --> 20:44.900
she can go to
with other girls who are...

20:45.000 --> 20:46.100
Is that what you want?

20:46.200 --> 20:47.300
No.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.100
I want this
not to be happening.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.200
But it is,and it's
gonna be happening

20:51.200 --> 20:52.900
whether she goes
to extension class

20:52.900 --> 20:55.500
or she's home schooled
or goes back to her old school.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.800
Oh,I don't think Amy
could do that.

20:56.900 --> 20:59.000
She could if she wanted,
if you wanted.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.300
I can't even get her
to leave the house anymore.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.800
She's gotta get over that.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.200
She can't hide her face in shame.
What happened happened.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.400
Like I said before,she's a good girl,
and I mean that.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.100
She is.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.300
She is a good girl.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.600
And you're a good mother,
and you'll get through this

21:16.600 --> 21:18.100
and Amy will get through this.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.000
But don't let her hide from people,
and don't you hide from people.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.500
Don't make it so important.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.600
It is what it is,you know?

21:26.600 --> 21:28.500
You want me to get her
a private tutor

21:28.500 --> 21:31.100
so she could stay home and get
her schooling, and I'll do it.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.300
You want to send her
to a private school

21:33.300 --> 21:36.200
or-or a different school,
just let me know I got connections.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.200
But,please,don't let Amy feel like
she's any less of a person

21:39.200 --> 21:41.200
than she was before this happened,

21:41.400 --> 21:43.900
Because she's not,
and neither are you.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.500
Just live with it,Anne.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.700
If you don't mind me sayin'
that,just live with it.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.100
Because there's nothing you could do.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.000
Just accept that things
are what they are,

21:52.400 --> 21:53.400
and that's OK.

21:53.500 --> 21:57.100
And if I could help you
in any way,please,

21:57.300 --> 21:59.000
just let me know.

22:00.300 --> 22:01.600
Thanks.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.900
So,did you wanna talk
or something,or...

22:19.400 --> 22:21.600
are you just content
to sit there and stare at me?

22:21.600 --> 22:23.700
I'm OK just staring at you.

22:26.500 --> 22:30.200
I don't guess that,uh,at 13,
you're allowed to date or anything?

22:30.300 --> 22:31.500
Are you kidding?

22:31.500 --> 22:34.200
After Amy,I don't think
I'll be allowed to date till I'm 21

22:34.500 --> 22:38.100
unless I undergo some voluntary
sterilization or something.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.100
That would be a shame.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.700
Why is that?

22:41.800 --> 22:43.100
I don't know.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.300
You're really pretty.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.700
Come on.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.800
Well,I mean,you know
you're pretty,right?

22:50.200 --> 22:51.600
I mean,you're beautiful.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.500
You may be the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.500
Just shut up,OK?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.300
You don't know that?

23:05.900 --> 23:09.800
Please - Please don't
tell anyone,OK?

23:10.100 --> 23:11.300
Never.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.800
I've-I've been
through a lot lately.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.100
I love Stephane Grappelli.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.000
- You do?
- Yeah,I love him.

23:24.100 --> 23:26.500
Oh,with,uh,
what's his name?

23:26.600 --> 23:27.400
Uh,oh,

23:27.400 --> 23:28.500
- Django Reinhardt.
- Reinhardt.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.400
Oh,God. Amazing.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.900
Yeah. I don't think there's
anything like the two of them.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.600
Unless it's the two of us.

23:34.700 --> 23:35.600
Who?

23:35.800 --> 23:38.400
Uh,Stephane Grappelli
and Django Reinhardt?

23:38.400 --> 23:41.100
They're jazz musicians.
Or, they used to be.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.300
Yeah,I know who they are.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.500
- No,you don't.
- Oh,yeah.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.100
Stephane Grappelli is
on a Pink Floyd album -

23:48.500 --> 23:49.600
Wish You Were Here.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.700
- It's true.
- Dad.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.300
- Pink Floyd?
- Look it up,cool cat.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.000
- OK.
- Dad.

23:56.300 --> 23:56.900
What?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.300
Let's just change
the subject.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.200
So,have you thought any more
about coming back to school?

24:02.500 --> 24:04.500
Oh,yeah.
No,I can't do that.

24:04.700 --> 24:07.800
Well, other than home schooling,
what are your options?

24:08.400 --> 24:12.400
Should I be here while you and Ben are
discussing your educational future?

24:12.500 --> 24:14.700
Right. Um,that's
probably something

24:14.700 --> 24:16.500
you'd like to discuss
with Amy and her mother

24:16.700 --> 24:17.600
without me.

24:17.700 --> 24:20.000
Maybe I'll just go find out
what happened to Henry,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.700
and maybe we'll be going.

24:21.700 --> 24:22.600
Maybe.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.200
But it's been great
seein' ya.

24:31.000 --> 24:31.700
I'm sorry.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.000
Probably should have asked
if Ben could come over.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.000
No,it's OK.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.800
I just wanna spend a little time
with you and Ashley myself.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.200
What do you think's
goin' on in there?

24:40.600 --> 24:41.500
I don't know.

24:44.300 --> 24:47.300
Look,Amy,I know
high school students stink,

24:47.400 --> 24:48.900
but that's your school.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.700
And if you wanna go
back to your school

24:50.700 --> 24:52.500
instead of being sent out
to the edge of the village

24:52.500 --> 24:54.400
for some extension class
or something,

24:54.500 --> 24:56.100
then claim your rights.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.900
You go back to school
with Ben and your friends,

24:57.900 --> 24:59.700
and you hold your head
up high.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.800
I want to.
Dad,I can't.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.400
I really - I can't.
I'm not that brave.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.800
Yes,you are.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.000
And you're already past
the worst part of this.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.100
You told me.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.000
Now that I know,everything
else is a piece of cake.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.400
No. It isn't.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.400
Kids at my school are mean.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.000
You're not mean.
You're a little bit -

25:21.400 --> 25:23.600
You're a little opinionated
about some things

25:23.600 --> 25:24.800
but you're not mean

25:25.800 --> 25:27.100
And you love me.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.400
Kids at my school
do not love me.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.200
I do,Amy.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.800
I love you very much.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.400
And Ashley
and... even your mother.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.800
But...

25:38.400 --> 25:40.100
I've made some mistakes.

25:40.900 --> 25:44.400
Yep. So have I,Dad.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.200
Oh,sweetie.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.900
Oh,uh,I'll get that.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.300
It's probably a neighbor.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.700
No one knows
I've moved in yet.

25:59.900 --> 26:00.800
Adrian,it's me.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.300
I brought you and Grace
a pizza.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.100
Is that Ricky?

26:06.600 --> 26:07.700
Adrian?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.900
I really didn't
think this through.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.400
Adrian?

26:15.600 --> 26:17.600
Dad,you're dating Adrian?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.500
Adrian's mother
is a friend of mine.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.300
Well,she was a friend
of mine.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.300
I said I'd made some mistakes.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.500
People make mistakes.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.300
I told my mom you were bringing by a
book I need to write my paper.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.700
I don't have a book.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.300
Yeah,you do.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.100
Nice work.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.600
I brought you a pizza.

26:47.700 --> 26:48.800
I'm not hungry.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.400
Suit yourself,
but I got it for you.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.700
Yeah,sure you did.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.400
And I'm sure you just
wanna talk.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.300
I do.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.000
I'm not doing anything
with you.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.100
I'm not asking you to do
anything with me but talk.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.700
So start talking.

27:02.100 --> 27:05.400
My girlfriend -or ex-girlfriend
Adrian hates me.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.900
Amy hates me.
Everyone hates me.

27:08.000 --> 27:08.700
So?

27:08.800 --> 27:10.400
So I think more people
will hate me

27:10.400 --> 27:13.300
if I have to walk the hallways
with a pregnant Amy Juergens

27:13.300 --> 27:15.200
walkin' the same hallways.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.600
So I was just thinkin',
can't you convince Amy

27:17.600 --> 27:19.600
it's not a good idea for her
to come back to school?

27:19.600 --> 27:21.600
You know
it's not a good idea.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.500
Because her continuing her education
will cut into your social life.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.100
Yeah. But I don't
want her ridiculed.

27:29.100 --> 27:32.600
I don't want anyone makin' fun of
the woman carrying my child.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.500
Look,no one's gonna
say anything to me

27:34.500 --> 27:36.500
'cause... I'm me.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.200
But Amy...

27:38.800 --> 27:40.200
she's a movin' target.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.200
Well,what do you know?
We agree on something.

27:43.400 --> 27:47.200
Yeah. I don't even know why
she decided to have the baby.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.000
We both know
we made a mistake.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.800
We both know we're not ready
to be parents.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.800
Now I'm forced
into takin' care of her,

27:53.800 --> 27:55.700
takin' care of both of 'em.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.500
Guess you should have been
more careful.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.800
I should have been
more careful,

27:58.800 --> 28:00.100
she should have been
more careful.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.100
Yeah,you both should have
been more careful, but you weren't.

28:03.200 --> 28:07.100
Now you are both responsible
for bringing a child into this world.

28:07.200 --> 28:07.900
Jealous?

28:07.900 --> 28:11.300
Oh,yeah,I am jealous
because I am dying

28:11.300 --> 28:14.500
to be a teenaged mother,because
that's what every girl wants to be.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.000
I meant are you jealous
that I had sex with her?

28:17.200 --> 28:18.000
No.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.200
Are you sure?

28:19.300 --> 28:21.300
Kinda got the impression
from you and Madison

28:21.300 --> 28:22.900
that you're both jealous.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
You know,
not every girl wants you.

28:25.300 --> 28:29.300
Yeah,some girls think you are
an uncaring,heartless jerk.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.700
Some girls,yeah.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Come on.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.700
I'm not a total jerk,am I?

28:36.300 --> 28:38.000
What's a girl
as good-lookin' as you

28:38.000 --> 28:40.500
doin' home on a Saturday
night alone anyway?

28:40.600 --> 28:43.600
I see right through this,
you know that?

28:44.100 --> 28:45.100
I know that.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.600
And still,here you are.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.200
- Well..
- Hi..

29:09.400 --> 29:11.400
Well,hi yourself.

29:11.800 --> 29:12.900
Are you Tom?

29:12.900 --> 29:15.000
Are you Betty?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.400
Yeah,I'm Betty.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.300
You know,it's gonna
cost you money

29:21.300 --> 29:24.200
if you want me
to be your friend,you know.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.900
OK.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.700
I just have a feeling
something is going on.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.900
I really have to
go home,Adrian.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.400
If I'm not home by midnight,
my parents are gonna kill me.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.000
Oh,Lord,
keep us safe from harm.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.500
Hi there.

30:03.000 --> 30:03.700
Hi.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.900
My wife says you've been
parked out here all night.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.200
What do you want?

30:11.300 --> 30:12.700
Adrian?

30:13.400 --> 30:14.100
Yeah?

30:15.100 --> 30:16.800
Are you Adrian Lee?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah.

30:23.600 --> 30:27.000
My agreement with your mother
is that this would never happen.

30:29.900 --> 30:32.300
Please don't come
around here again.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.100
I have a family.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.800
Oh,God,you too?

31:02.200 --> 31:03.500
What do you mean,
"you too"?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.500
You're cheating on Dad?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.200
Leo,Ben's Dad,
came by.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.400
Why?

31:09.500 --> 31:11.700
I don't know. He just wanted to make
sure that I knew that he was OK

31:11.700 --> 31:13.500
with you and Ben going out.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.100
He came over
just to tell you that?

31:16.900 --> 31:20.000
Couldn't he just call or send some
sausage servant to tell you?

31:20.100 --> 31:23.500
Let's get back to "you too."
Is your father dating someone?

31:23.500 --> 31:25.500
Did he bring someone over
while you guys were there?

31:25.600 --> 31:26.400
No.

31:26.600 --> 31:29.700
But he is dating.I mean,
or he was,anyway.

31:29.800 --> 31:30.400
Who?

31:30.600 --> 31:31.500
You know.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.400
He's having an affair
with Adrian's mother.

31:34.700 --> 31:39.700
You know,Adrian,the slut,
the majorette,drummer's girlfriend.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.100
Slut must run in the family.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.500
You know what,Ashley?

31:43.500 --> 31:45.600
Dad said
that he would tell her.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.200
Mom,Dad's not having an affair.
He's not even dating anyone.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.900
They might have dated, like,
once or twice, but they're just friends.

31:52.900 --> 31:54.600
He borrowed her condo
so we could hang out tonight.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.100
When do you stop
being so gullible?

31:56.100 --> 31:57.600
When the baby arrives?

31:57.600 --> 31:58.500
Ashley.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.500
Why can't you both just be
like normal parents

32:00.500 --> 32:02.600
and get addicted to Internet
orn or something?

32:02.600 --> 32:05.200
Why do you have to get involved
with other parents?

32:07.200 --> 32:08.900
What about you, princess?

32:08.900 --> 32:11.400
Why do you have to get involved
with my friends' friends?

32:11.400 --> 32:13.100
Henry has a girlfriend.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.400
Alice and him have been
dating since third grade.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.100
She broke up with him.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.100
Alice broke up with Henry?

32:19.600 --> 32:22.500
Damn it,I'm no better
than Madison and Lauren.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.800
I don't want you two girls using
that kind of language,OK?

32:26.200 --> 32:28.900
Mom,I'm pregnant,and you're worried
I'm gonna use bad words?

32:28.900 --> 32:31.200
Yes.No. I...

32:31.200 --> 32:33.100
I don't know
what I'm saying,OK?

32:33.300 --> 32:35.700
I just found out that your
father has a girlfriend.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.900
It's one thing to suspect
something like that.

32:37.900 --> 32:40.700
It's another thing to have it
confirmed by your own daughters.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.300
He made a mistake.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.100
He said that? To you?

32:44.100 --> 32:44.900
Yes.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.400
Mom,Adrian's mom is
out of town all the time.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.700
She's a flight attendant.
She travels a lot.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.200
Somehow Dad convinced Adrian
to let us borrow her condo

32:53.200 --> 32:55.000
'cause he knew I didn't want
to go out anywhere.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.700
He just did it for me
because he knew I didn't want

32:56.700 --> 32:58.500
anyone to see me like this.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.000
Besides,Dad's just living
at the furniture store.

33:01.100 --> 33:02.800
Wait,What?When did he say that?

33:02.800 --> 33:03.900
He didn't tell me that.

33:03.900 --> 33:06.900
Yes,cause you were hiding in
the back room like a little baby.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.600
Maybe if you hadn't acted
like a child all night,

33:08.600 --> 33:09.500
you would have known.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.000
You think you're so grown up
just 'cause you're having a baby.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.100
OK,stop it.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.200
Wait. Wait a minute.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.700
He's living
in the furniture store?

33:16.900 --> 33:20.300
Why isn't he staying
in a hotel,or an apartment or

33:22.000 --> 33:23.200
Oh,no.

33:23.700 --> 33:24.800
No!

33:26.700 --> 33:28.100
No,no,no.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.100
Mom?

33:29.300 --> 33:31.400
Dad's not living
with Adrian's mom.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.900
OK? He's not.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.000
Oh,no.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.000
What?

33:37.400 --> 33:39.200
Dad didn't,um,
mention anything

33:39.200 --> 33:41.100
about being broke,
did he?

33:41.100 --> 33:42.000
What?

33:42.500 --> 33:45.500
Well,why else would he be
living at the furniture store?

33:46.800 --> 33:49.300
OK,Mom,you have to
let him come home.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.800
I don't mind people knowing
that she's having a baby

33:51.900 --> 33:55.100
and he's having an affair and
you're doing whatever with Ben's dad,

33:55.100 --> 33:56.900
but I do mind people
knowing that we're poor.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.600
That is the
ultimate humiliation.

33:58.600 --> 34:01.500
What,are we so poor that
he has to sleep at his own store?

34:01.800 --> 34:03.800
Please,Mom,just let him
come home. Please.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.300
I don't understand
why you guys

34:05.300 --> 34:07.700
think he's broke
or we're broke or whatever.

34:08.100 --> 34:10.800
Maybe Dad just enjoys sleeping
at his furniture store.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.300
Now you see
how she got in trouble.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.300
Just when I thought things
could not get any worse.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.199
Mom,You have to go get him.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.900
You cannot let him display
our poverty to the public,OK?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.199
It's just -
I can take a lot of things,

34:23.199 --> 34:26.000
but I cannot take that.
I just cannot.

34:26.300 --> 34:29.600
But,Ashley,
I don't want him here.OK?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.600
I really don't want him here.

34:31.699 --> 34:35.199
Mom,I hate him
as much as you do,OK?

34:35.300 --> 34:37.300
But we can't just make him
look like a big loser.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.000
We're all gonna look
like big losers.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.699
Is that what you want?The whole
world is gonna pity us.

34:41.699 --> 34:42.800
Ashley,I can't.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.300
Not after everything
that he's done.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.600
I just can't.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.100
Mom,I am asking you.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.800
Let him come home.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.199
It's just for a while,please.

34:53.699 --> 34:54.800
Please.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.100
OK,Ashley,
but I'm not calling him,OK?

35:00.100 --> 35:01.700
You have to call him.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.900
And it's just till we figure
something else out.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.800
The refreshments
are delicious.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.900
Oh,yes.

35:21.500 --> 35:24.100
No smoking.
It's bad for you.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.300
Oh,I know,
but believe me,

35:26.600 --> 35:28.900
this is not the most
dangerous part of my job.

35:28.900 --> 35:32.700
I mean,I hope I live long enough
to die of lung cancer.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.700
Want one?

35:41.500 --> 35:42.500
Have you smoked before?

35:42.500 --> 35:43.300
No.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.900
Oh,you know what?

35:46.400 --> 35:48.300
Yeah,you know,
it might make you sick,Tom.

35:48.300 --> 35:50.300
It's very addictive.

35:50.500 --> 35:54.000
You smoke one,you know,
seems like nothing.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.300
You smoke another one.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.600
Ah,no big deal.

35:57.600 --> 36:02.000
Then you smoke a third one.
Blammo,you're hooked.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.800
And it is very,
very difficult to quit.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.000
That's a good idea.

36:20.400 --> 36:23.600
Tom,I need you
to know something.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.100
If you don't p me
the money,

36:26.900 --> 36:30.700
a very mean guy
is gonna come and beat you up

36:30.700 --> 36:33.700
with a bag of oranges
that he keeps in his trunk.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.500
So you need to pay me
the money. I gotta pay him.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.500
He doesn't let me
keep the money,you know.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.000
I didn't know that.

36:41.000 --> 36:41.700
Yeah.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.800
Well,now you know,and that's
what friends are for -

36:44.800 --> 36:46.600
to tell you stuff like that.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.600
You wanna know
something else?

36:48.600 --> 36:50.000
OK.

36:50.500 --> 36:55.700
OK. Well,lots of the girls
are addicted to drugs,

36:55.700 --> 36:58.900
all kinds of terrible,
terrible drugs.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.900
And that's why
they need the money.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.500
It's a very,
very dirty business,

37:03.500 --> 37:07.500
and most of the men who call me,
they're not very nice.

37:07.700 --> 37:10.600
And if they were nice,
they would have,like,a girlfriend

37:10.600 --> 37:14.900
or a - or - right? - or a wife or
something,right?But they don't.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.000
You really hit the jackpot
when you got me.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.900
Yeah,but there's
a lot of other girls

37:22.000 --> 37:25.200
on the website
that - they're not nice.

37:25.300 --> 37:28.000
They don't care about you,
and they're not your friend.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.100
And they'd come into your beautiful
home,and they rob your family.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.200
So will you do me
a favor?

37:36.300 --> 37:39.800
Will you stay away
from those websites?

37:40.400 --> 37:42.500
'Cause someone's gonna
take advantage of you.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.200
Will you promise me?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.900
I love my sausage pizza.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.100
And I really liked
our conversation.

37:53.900 --> 37:56.800
That's gonna be $200.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.600
Hi.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.300
Thank you.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.000
Tom?

38:06.700 --> 38:07.600
Who's this?

38:08.200 --> 38:10.100
Here,take that back.

38:13.100 --> 38:14.400
How are you?

38:18.100 --> 38:19.200
Good night,Tom.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.800
- Beautiful home.
- Oh,thanks.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.400
Tom,who is that?

38:26.600 --> 38:28.600
She's a friend.

38:28.900 --> 38:30.500
Like Ricky.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.800
He came here tonight.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.800
Really? What'd he say?
What was he wearing?

38:39.600 --> 38:41.400
So when are you gonna
break up with Alice?

38:41.700 --> 38:42.900
I don't know,

38:43.800 --> 38:45.400
but the sooner,the better.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.400
Maybe you should sleep on it.
Maybe you'll feel differently tomorrow.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.100
No,I want it over with.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.700
I want it over with
by tomorrow.

38:51.800 --> 38:54.400
You've known her since the
third grade.This is Alice.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.700
She's just not somebody
you "get over with."

38:57.100 --> 38:59.100
Not everyone is as lucky
as you are.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.900
Some people get stuck
in relationships

39:00.900 --> 39:02.900
they don't want to be in
just because they're too scared

39:02.900 --> 39:05.300
to let go of it,
I don't wanna be like that.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.600
I'm too young to be like that.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.500
If I'm never as lucky as you,
if I never find someone,

39:10.500 --> 39:13.600
if I never fall in love,
then... at least

39:13.600 --> 39:15.700
I will have tried
to get what you have.

39:15.800 --> 39:19.000
The perfect girl,who's pregnant
by some other guy.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.000
I'm sorry,Ben.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.600
I forgot for a minute.

39:23.800 --> 39:24.400
It's OK.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.200
You're not changing
your mind,are you?

39:26.300 --> 39:27.000
No.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.600
Never.

39:31.300 --> 39:32.900
She hasn't even
tried to call me.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.100
She totally takes
me for granted,

39:35.100 --> 39:37.200
and I'm tired of it,
I'm just tired of it.

39:37.400 --> 39:41.100
Then break up with her,
but be nice about it.

39:41.300 --> 39:42.600
I mean,Alice is tough
on the outside,

39:42.600 --> 39:45.400
but she's gonna be really upset.
You know that,right?

39:45.500 --> 39:47.800
I know,I know,
but what can I do?

39:47.900 --> 39:50.900
I can't do this anymore,
and I have to break up with her.

39:50.900 --> 39:51.800
I have to.

39:51.900 --> 39:52.600
OK.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.500
What?

39:55.500 --> 39:59.900
Alice didn't by chance
break up with you,did she?

40:03.000 --> 40:03.800
Yeah.

40:18.000 --> 40:18.600
Hey.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.600
Your friend Ricky
dropped by.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.800
Blew my cover.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.700
Let me ask you something.

40:30.400 --> 40:34.400
How does a guy stay married
to a woman for 15 years

40:35.000 --> 40:37.200
and have two
daughters with her

40:38.300 --> 40:40.800
and then
just walk away

40:42.200 --> 40:44.300
Have we ever had
a conversation?

40:44.800 --> 40:46.500
I don't think so,

40:46.500 --> 40:48.500
so I don't think we'll be
starting with that one.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.400
Why not? I wanna know.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.200
Why do you wanna know?

40:53.400 --> 40:55.400
Because that's what
my father did.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.500
He just walked away,
and he never looked back.

40:58.500 --> 41:02.400
And he knows I'm here -he knows -
and he acts like I don't even exist.

41:02.400 --> 41:05.900
Oh,Adrian,oh,honey,it's OK.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.900
You got your mother.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.200
She'll be home
in a couple of days.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.100
It's one thing
to cheat on Mom.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.200
It's another thing
to cheat on Amy and me.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.400
I'm never gonna speak to you
as long as I live,you got it?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.600
Tell him he can stay
at the house

41:29.600 --> 41:31.900
if he can't afford
to stay anywhere else

41:32.700 --> 41:34.300
and if he isn't still
with your mother

41:35.000 --> 41:38.800
and if he's... really living
at the store.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.000
I left my cell phone
in your room.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.200
Go home.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.800
What's the point now?

41:51.900 --> 41:54.400
The point is
if you want forgiveness,

41:54.600 --> 41:56.900
eventually they'll forgive you.

41:57.500 --> 42:02.700
If my father ever came to me
and asked me to forgive him,

42:03.800 --> 42:05.300
I would forgive him.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.800
Not me.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.600
Good night.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.300
Come on over.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
