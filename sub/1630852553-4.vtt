00:15.667 --> 00:18.148
- Dinner's ready.
I made burgers.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.497
What are you doing?

00:19.541 --> 00:21.543
- I can't stay here
anymore, Lois.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.501
It's not that I don't
appreciate you taking me in,

00:23.545 --> 00:25.895
because I do,
but it's too much.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.419
- Luce, don't be silly.
We love having you here.

00:28.463 --> 00:29.855
The boys adore you.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.293
- It's too much for me,
being around

00:32.336 --> 00:35.078
your perfect family
and your perfect life.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.602
I know you're trying
to help me, but staying here

00:37.646 --> 00:41.606
for the past few months has
only made things worse for me.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.565
Does that make sense?
- No, it doesn't,

00:43.608 --> 00:45.654
because you are
a part of this family,

00:45.697 --> 00:46.872
and we love you.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.613
- And I love all of you.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.354
But I have to build
my own life,

00:50.398 --> 00:53.357
and I need to be around people
who understand me

00:53.401 --> 00:56.012
and know
what I'm going through.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.188
- Are you...

00:58.232 --> 01:00.756
- Staying with Ally
for a while, yes,

01:00.799 --> 01:03.106
but only until I can afford
to get my own place.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.282
- I can't let you do that.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.545
- Well, that's not
your decision to make.

01:07.589 --> 01:10.200
Ally is my friend.
- She is a parasite.

01:10.244 --> 01:13.116
She leeches onto people
when they are at their lowest

01:13.160 --> 01:15.640
and convinces them that she's
the only one who can fix them.

01:15.684 --> 01:17.294
- I'm not having
this conversation again.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.904
- Lucy, you're just having
a hard time right now.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.342
- I've been having a hard time
my whole life!

01:21.385 --> 01:23.344
I have lost everything.

01:23.387 --> 01:28.131
My job, my fiancé, Mom.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.654
There is a hole inside of me,

01:29.698 --> 01:32.701
and I thought staying here
with you would fill it,

01:32.744 --> 01:34.137
but it won't.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.139
Why can't you see that?

01:37.271 --> 01:38.794
- I see you.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.275
Okay?
I do.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.407
I see you.
- But you can't help me.

01:43.451 --> 01:47.019
- And Ally can?
- She already has.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.460
- Where is my sister, Ally?

01:52.503 --> 01:54.114
- She didn't want to see you.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.116
- You mean you wouldn't
allow her to see me.

01:56.159 --> 01:59.031
Were you afraid I might
get through to her?

01:59.075 --> 02:01.643
- No, that's not the issue,

02:01.686 --> 02:03.558
and despite what you believe,

02:03.601 --> 02:06.256
I don't force
any of my congregants

02:06.300 --> 02:08.215
to do anything
they don't want to do.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.477
- Congregants?

02:09.520 --> 02:12.044
So the Inverse Society
is a religion now?

02:13.437 --> 02:16.701
- Call it whatever you like.
- How about a cult?

02:16.745 --> 02:18.964
- We're a group
of willing individuals

02:19.008 --> 02:22.142
on a journey
towards completion.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.883
I am simply leading the way.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.669
- You're a folk hero
for the misguided,

02:27.712 --> 02:30.062
brainwashing weak-minded people
into believing

02:30.106 --> 02:32.848
that you're the only one
who can make them whole.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.372
- Is that really what you think
about your sister,

02:35.416 --> 02:36.765
that she's weak-minded?

02:36.808 --> 02:40.334
- She was in pain,
and you exploited that pain.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.379
Now she's a shell
of who she once was.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.251
She's broken and broke,

02:44.294 --> 02:46.340
withdrawn from
her friends and family.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.863
- Not all of her family.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.388
Lucy calls
your father regularly.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.911
- My father didn't have
to pull Lucy

02:52.955 --> 02:55.262
out of a bathtub
and bring her back to life.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.220
I did.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.483
- Lucy wasn't dying.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.094
She was ascending
to another plane.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.531
- Like Heather Ackerman?

03:03.574 --> 03:05.489
- Heather Ackerman was
an isolated incident.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.405
- She died because of you.

03:08.449 --> 03:09.493
- She had a heart condition

03:09.537 --> 03:11.191
that she didn't disclose
to anybody.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.976
- You should be in prison
for the rest of your life.

03:14.019 --> 03:17.240
- You certainly tried to make
that happen, didn't you?

03:17.284 --> 03:20.461
But your
one-sided exposé failed.

03:20.504 --> 03:23.159
- It shut you down.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.292
- Only for a while.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.251
I suggest you listen to our

After the world hears

03:32.560 --> 03:35.215
maybe you'll be the one
who's canceled.

03:36.259 --> 03:40.002
- Whatever I have to do,
I am gonna make sure

03:40.045 --> 03:44.224
that Lucy and everyone else
you have infected

03:44.267 --> 03:48.053
