Ha, sorry.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.471

of Boden's

09:56.513 --> 09:58.014
cozy relationship with Schafer.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.392
- Yeah, one bottle of scotch
saves us a whole lot of work.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.105
Hey, Severide, there's some

10:05.146 --> 10:07.649
CPD big wig out there
looking for you.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.984
- Commander Pearce?
- Mm-mm-mm.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.954
Close the door.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.790
Good to see you too.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.376
Hi. Melissa Keating.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.211
Kelly Severide.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.005
LaSalle Indemnity?

10:30.046 --> 10:32.424
- Kelly doesn't carry around
business cards,

10:32.465 --> 10:35.468
but he's a decorated
lieutenant with rescue squad.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.930
He's got close ties to the
Office of Fire Investigation,

10:38.972 --> 10:41.516
thanks to his impressive
investigative skills.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.976
It's in the blood.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.060
His dad, Benny,
was one of the best

10:44.102 --> 10:45.979
arson investigators around.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.148
- Benny Severide, I think
I've actually heard that name.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.984
- But the most important thing
to know about Kelly

10:51.026 --> 10:52.777
is that he owes me a big favor.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.198
What would you like me to do?

10:57.240 --> 11:01.036
- You're gonna help me take
down the corrupt head of OFI.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.374
Captain Tom Van Meter.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.003
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

11:10.045 --> 11:11.254
One of our clients,

11:11.296 --> 11:13.048
a property developer
named Stephen Flores,

11:13.089 --> 11:15.592
started building condominiums
in Logan Square.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.595
Then, rising interest rates
and a cooling market

11:18.636 --> 11:21.306
made it a lousy business
to be in.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.599
Luckily for Flores,

11:22.640 --> 11:25.018
the construction site
burned down last month.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.187
Now he gets to collect
on his policy

11:27.228 --> 11:29.022
and use the money
to build a more lucrative

11:29.064 --> 11:32.025
multi-use complex
on the property.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.360
So you think this was arson?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.820
- When I conducted
my investigation of the scene,

11:35.862 --> 11:38.698
I found what appears
to be clear evidence

11:38.740 --> 11:40.909
of the use of an accelerant.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.787
Imagine my surprise

11:43.828 --> 11:45.914
when the official OFI report
comes in and I see that

11:45.955 --> 11:48.625
Van Meter declared
the fire accidental.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.544
- Clearing the way
for Flores to raze the site,

11:51.586 --> 11:54.047
thereby destroying any evidence
that might remain.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.174
- So you're saying
Van Meter fudged the report?

11:57.509 --> 11:59.886
No, it's not possible.
Didn't happen.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.221
What makes you so sure?

12:01.262 --> 12:02.847
- Van Meter's nothing
if not honest.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.476
He's one of the good guys.
He wouldn't cover up an arson--

12:06.518 --> 12:08.061
not for a million dollars.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.438
How about for an old friend?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.357
- I decided to look
into Captain Van Meter

12:12.399 --> 12:14.442
and discovered
that he and Flores

12:14.484 --> 12:16.486
grew up on the same block
in Irving Park.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.696
They went to the same school,

12:17.737 --> 12:19.072
played on the same varsity
basketball team--

12:19.114 --> 12:20.490
- So what?
- And they were photographed

12:20.532 --> 12:23.618
together at a reunion event
for the school

12:23.660 --> 12:25.161
just a few years ago.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.371
That's pretty damning, huh?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.500
At least the state's attorney
thinks so.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.003
It's serious enough
they brought it to CPD.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.382
And now I'm bringing it
to you, Kelly.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.300
I need you to get
to the bottom of this.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.926
but it's a little
out of my price range.

20:19.469 --> 20:22.138
Thank you, Sylvie.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.890
You're always there to help.

is from the one case?

20:33.983 --> 20:37.737
- Yeah, and everything
they collected from the scene.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.572
Gotta go through it all,
piece it together,

20:39.614 --> 20:41.241
and hopefully come up
with the same conclusion

20:41.282 --> 20:43.201
as Van Meter.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.829
- No small job, huh?
- No.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.998
I'm gonna stay here tonight
and work on this after shift.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.459
I gotta get to the bottom of it
before Van Meter realizes

20:51.501 --> 20:53.420
I took all this stuff.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.921
Hey, Chief.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.548
- You okay?
- Eh.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.758
Still stinging a bit
from that humiliation.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.135
Sorry about the squad table.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.886
Forget it.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.180
We all got
a little too complacent.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.474
So Kidd,
can I put you in charge

21:06.516 --> 21:07.767
of prepping the house
for the next shift?

21:07.809 --> 21:09.686
Oh, you got it, Chief, yeah.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.229
- Leave it to me.
- Thanks.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.439
- Mm-hmm.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.109
- Looks like we both
got our work cut out for us.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.069
Mm.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.904
All right.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.323
[coughing]

21:22.365 --> 21:25.118
Don't look at me like that.
It was just a nervous cough.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.203
- I have the X-ray here.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.913
Let me show you what we got.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.582
Wow, that was fast.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.960
- Why don't you come closer
so you can see?

21:34.002 --> 21:37.047
This cloudy area
here in the chest--

21:37.088 --> 21:38.965
this is what we're looking at.

21:39.007 --> 21:40.342
Okay?

21:40.383 --> 21:41.676
What does it mean?

21:41.718 --> 21:42.802
- It could be
a number of things,

21:42.844 --> 21:45.096
including
a lingering infection,

21:45.138 --> 21:47.640
but I can't be sure
until I get a closer look.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.100
I wanna do a CAT scan.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.810
Oh.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.645
Right. Now?

21:52.687 --> 21:53.688
- Yes, the CAT scan
will give us

21:53.730 --> 21:54.939
a more definitive answer,

21:54.981 --> 21:57.984
and we'll get the results
in a couple days.

21:58.026 --> 22:02.781
- Like, what other kinds
of things are we talking about?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.032
- There's no reason
to worry yet.

22:04.074 --> 22:05.784
- All right.
- There are too many options

22:05.825 --> 22:07.994
that aren't dangerous
long-term.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.121
I'll go get a nurse
to take you in, Mrs. Herrmann.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.581
- Like I said before,
you can call me Cindy.

all her bases, you know?

22:22.384 --> 22:23.510
She said not to worry.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.428
- Why is she showing me
an X-ray?

22:25.470 --> 22:26.721
I'm not a medical professional.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.140
Just tell me what I have.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.684
Oh, doctors drive me crazy.

22:30.725 --> 22:31.935
Have I told you that before?

22:31.976 --> 22:33.937
- Only, like,
a gabillion times,

22:33.978 --> 22:36.189
but you have to be nice
to this one.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.691
I'm trying,

22:37.732 --> 22:39.567
but if she calls me
Mrs. Herrmann one more time,

22:39.609 --> 22:41.528
she's getting
a knuckle sandwich.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.571
[chuckles]

22:47.492 --> 22:49.619
- What is this?
- Oh, uh, the gas pump

22:49.661 --> 22:51.788
didn't give me a receipt,
so I made one.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.875
I should've gone inside
and asked.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.502
- That was dumb.
- No, no, it's, uh--

22:57.544 --> 22:59.254
[clears throat]
It happens, and you made

22:59.295 --> 23:01.047
the effort to write it down,
so that's good.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.174
Uh, I'm sorry
I'm such a stress case.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.551
This is just--this is
a lot to deal with.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.302
It is, but they'd be crazy

23:06.344 --> 23:07.387
to let this program go.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.555
It is a gem.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.683
- [sighs]
This is all my fault.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.728
I riled 'em up and set
another disaster in motion.

23:14.769 --> 23:16.688
- Hey, you can't blame
yourself for this.

23:16.730 --> 23:19.107
- No way.
This is all on Emma.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.234

23:21.276 --> 23:22.360

23:22.402 --> 23:23.486
Herrmann isn't around,

23:23.528 --> 23:25.238
so I figured it's a good time

23:25.280 --> 23:28.742
to borrow all
the cleaning supplies we have

23:28.783 --> 23:30.368
and take 'em over to 51.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.538
- You know, this reinspection
is a real slap in the face.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.166
Damn.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.625
This thing's heavy.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.753

a little closer.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.463

I can take it.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.006
Great.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.507
All right, I'll just shove it
to the end of the bar.

You pick it up on your way out?

You got it, Lieutenant.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.806

Why do I feel like
I'm being ambushed?

24:36.893 --> 24:38.895

company disagrees with you

24:38.937 --> 24:40.563
on the cause of this fire.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.732
- How is that any
of your business?

24:42.774 --> 24:44.484
- They think
you're covering something up.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.860
Now CPD's involved.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.700
- And you're helping them?
- I'm trying to help you.

24:51.741 --> 24:53.493
Why didn't you disclose
your relationship

24:53.535 --> 24:55.161

24:55.203 --> 24:57.288
- Stephen Flores?
That's not a relationship.

That's--that's just a guy
I used to know.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.584
- Okay, well, you look pretty
cozy in a photo that I saw

25:01.626 --> 25:03.044
from a few years ago.

25:05.463 --> 25:08.216
My high school reunion?

25:08.258 --> 25:14.055
That's what they're
basing this on?

25:14.097 --> 25:15.598
Severide,
that insurance investigator

25:15.640 --> 25:17.517
is wrong about the accelerant.

25:17.559 --> 25:21.521
The charring she noted was due
to an isoparaffinic hydrocarbon

25:21.563 --> 25:24.733
from a can of charcoal lighter
fluid that likely got crushed

25:24.774 --> 25:27.360
under a firefighter's boot
in zero visibility.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.195
The fire preceded that spill.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.906
The real cause
was a high-voltage short

25:31.948 --> 25:34.993
in a faulty EV charger.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.745
- The evidence

25:36.786 --> 25:38.496
it's not here.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.457
- Sure it is.
- It's not!

25:40.498 --> 25:41.750
Well, then it got lost!

25:44.711 --> 25:47.005
I don't get it.

that I've put in you?

Nowhere, yet.

26:58.410 --> 26:59.494
around why Van Meter would

26:59.536 --> 27:01.121
handle the case like this.

- I wish I could make it
make sense for you.

in that insurance investigator.

Hey.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.953
This is Melissa Keating
with the insurance company.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.164
What are we doing here?

29:49.205 --> 29:51.458
The Flores fire came
at a busy time for OFI.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.501
They were in the middle
of a dozen other cases.

29:53.543 --> 29:55.170
That would've
left them shorthanded.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.213
- Giving Van Meter
the justification he needed

29:57.255 --> 29:58.965
to personally handle
the case.

29:59.007 --> 30:00.967
- Exactly--he could claim that

30:01.009 --> 30:02.510
he didn't have the luxury
of recusing himself.

30:02.552 --> 30:04.721
- What about this
alleged missing evidence?

30:04.763 --> 30:06.014
Well, that's why we're here.

30:06.056 --> 30:07.474
If OFI were overwhelmed,

30:07.515 --> 30:10.101
Van Meter could say that
the evidence was misplaced.

30:10.143 --> 30:11.478
So I figure we take a look

30:11.519 --> 30:13.980
at the active cases
at the time--

30:14.022 --> 30:15.899
cover our bases.

on a treasure hunt?

the condominium fire.

- It's an electric vehicle

They suffered a small fire
around the same time

35:53.528 --> 35:55.030

- Well, someone thought
the EV charger evidence
