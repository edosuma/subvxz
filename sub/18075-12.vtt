[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:03.750 --> 00:05.703
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:05.789 --> 00:10.321
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:10.407 --> 00:14.525
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:14.609 --> 00:18.348
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help,
and if you can find them...

00:18.436 --> 00:20.589
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

[Woman On Radio]
Democratic leaders at the L.B.J. Ranch...

01:50.961 --> 01:53.741
the legislature votes
on a new highway bill...

01:53.832 --> 01:56.068
and millionaire entrepreneur
Calvin Cutter...

01:56.162 --> 01:59.735
ties the knot this week
with Jaclyn Taylor, daughter of...

[Phone Ringing]

02:24.452 --> 02:27.694
[Woman On Answering Machine]
Hi, this is Tracy. l"m not able
to come to the phone right now...

02:27.780 --> 02:31.898
but if you leave your name and number,
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

02:31.982 --> 02:36.431
- Remember to wait for the beep
before you start talking.
- Come on! Beep already!

02:36.517 --> 02:40.007
- [Beeps]
- Tracy, it's Jackie.
You've gotta help me.

02:40.095 --> 02:45.620
I gotta get outta Texas.
Cal's holding me prisoner at the ranch,
but I finally managed to sneak out.

02:45.711 --> 02:48.278
I'm on my way to Dallas.
I'll call you.

02:48.374 --> 02:50.740
[Screaming]
No! No!

03:02.643 --> 03:04.631
[Horn Honks]

03:15.873 --> 03:18.109
- L.A. Airport?
- Yeah.

03:34.386 --> 03:38.788
Excuse me. How are you going
to the airport? You're supposed to
take a right back there.

03:38.880 --> 03:44.027
- I-I said, you're going the wrong way.
- Don't worry, lady. I know a short cut.

03:44.122 --> 03:47.944
Hey, w-what're you doing?
Where're we going?

03:48.032 --> 03:50.233
Wha... What are you doing?

03:50.320 --> 03:52.308
Wh-Where're we...

03:57.643 --> 04:00.801
Look, what do you want?
I don't have any money.

04:00.888 --> 04:05.289
You better have somethin'
if you wanna hire the A-Team.
Roll up your window.

04:08.626 --> 04:11.454
[On Tape Recorder]
Tracy, it"s Jackie. You"ve gotta help me.

04:11.538 --> 04:17.147
I gotta get outta Texas.
Cal"s holding me prisoner at the ranch,
but I finally managed to sneak out.

04:17.238 --> 04:19.308
l"m on my way to Dallas.
l"ll call you.

04:19.401 --> 04:22.146
- [Screaming] No! No!
- [Clicks Off]

04:22.230 --> 04:26.383
Mr Lee told us your story
and played the tape for us.

04:26.473 --> 04:29.999
You want us to rescue your friend
from a man named Calvin Cutter?

04:30.093 --> 04:32.791
- He's Jackie's fiancé.
- [Face]
Isn"t he the guy who owns, like...

04:32.880 --> 04:36.489
- three-fourths of Wilson County, Texas?
- Yes.

04:36.583 --> 04:40.523
Jackie's father was his partner
until he was killed during
a burglary at his office.

04:40.618 --> 04:43.020
Jackie and Cal are supposed
to be getting married Saturday...

04:43.115 --> 04:47.599
but obviously against Jackie's wishes.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.637
- Have you told
the Dallas police about this?
- Well, that"s the problem.

04:51.726 --> 04:57.466
I reported it, and they called out there
and supposedly talked to Jackie,
who said everything was fine.

04:57.551 --> 05:00.958
Told them she was just pulling a prank
on an old sorority sister.

05:01.046 --> 05:03.365
She does have a rep
for being a bit of a banana.

05:03.459 --> 05:08.440
Jaclyn Taylor. Isn't that the girl
that did the nude bathing bit
in the fountain in Rome?

05:08.534 --> 05:11.397
- Yeah.
- [Tracy]
I know she"s in a lot of trouble.

05:11.488 --> 05:15.689
Look, I wouldn't have gone
through all this to find you guys
if I didn't really believe this.

05:15.773 --> 05:20.423
Well, we'd like to help you,
Tracy, but if you're gonna hire us,
we're very expensive.

05:20.516 --> 05:23.047
Once you rescue Jackie,
money won't be an issue.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.704
But for starters, I can
get you free passes through the airlines.

05:25.799 --> 05:28.462
- That"ll save you airfare to Dallas.
- No.

05:29.294 --> 05:34.441
Um, thanks anyway. Try not to worry.
We'll try and help your friend.

05:35.659 --> 05:41.564
Well, guys, looks like
we're going to a wedding.
Here. Give this to Amy.

05:41.650 --> 05:44.217
Now, you needed a cab
to go to the airport.

05:44.313 --> 05:46.430
- [Keys Clink]
- Here's a cab.

05:46.518 --> 05:48.671
Well, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

05:48.764 --> 05:52.041
Wait! Wait a minute. W-Wait.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.417
Wait. You guys can't leave me here.

05:54.505 --> 05:56.493
Wait a minute.

06:10.689 --> 06:13.174
- Yeah?
- We're here to deliver the weddin' cake.

06:13.268 --> 06:16.924
Well, I already let a truck through here
with a cake. How many they havin'?

06:17.013 --> 06:19.000
[Speaking Mock French]

06:19.093 --> 06:24.322
[French Accent] You say you let another
truck pass? That was the wrong cake.
That was the pineapple.

06:24.418 --> 06:29.612
- We are to be serving the lemon filling.
- Well, nobody said nothin'
about it bein' the wrong cake.

06:29.702 --> 06:34.849
Would you admit pineapple
when you should be having lemon?

06:37.731 --> 06:41.091
Mmm! A masterpiece.

06:41.184 --> 06:43.716
Okay, okay. Go on through.

06:47.133 --> 06:52.281
- Murdock, what are you doing?
That's shaving cream.
- So what? It's just a little soap.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.860
Murdock, you're always eating
such weird stuff.

06:54.955 --> 06:57.356
He's a weird dude.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.776
- Doesn't it ever get to you?
- Of course not.

07:00.862 --> 07:04.553
[Coughs]
Look, bubbles.

07:07.061 --> 07:09.427
## [Country]

07:27.239 --> 07:29.605
But I just wanna use the restroom.

07:29.693 --> 07:35.054
Well, I'm sorry, but nobody is allowed
in the house except in the kitchen, and
there ain't no restroom in the kitchen.

07:35.143 --> 07:39.959
Now, if you want to use
the one down here by the pool,
it's been set up for guests for you.

07:40.052 --> 07:42.040
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:49.496 --> 07:54.312
- You look just like that guy
at Lucy's in Saigon.
- Well, you look like Lucy.

07:54.405 --> 08:00.144
- B.A., you and I'll get the cake.
- [French Accent] Be careful with that.
It took me hours to bake it.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.928
It's only cardboard, fool.
It's not a real cake.

08:03.017 --> 08:06.342
Some people have
no appreciation for art.

08:06.429 --> 08:09.871
Hi, there.
Hannibal, this is not gonna
be real simple to pull off.

08:09.965 --> 08:14.035
This ranch is set up like Fort Knox,
and the guests include the sheriff
and the mayor.

08:14.125 --> 08:17.118
- What about the inside?
- Beats me. Nobody can get in there.

08:17.204 --> 08:19.818
- Well, they gotta let
the caterers into the kitchen.
- [Hannibal] Right.

08:19.908 --> 08:23.896
B.A., you check out the kitchen. See if
we can get to the inside from there.

08:23.985 --> 08:26.648
Amy, you shoot the layout of the house
from the outside.

08:26.731 --> 08:31.049
Le chef, mingle around. Find out
which guests are carrying weapons.

08:31.141 --> 08:33.707
And Face?
You get to find the bride.

08:33.803 --> 08:36.086
You bet.
And what are you gonna be doing?

08:36.174 --> 08:38.162
Oh, just tinkering around.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.264
Excuse me.
Where did you come from?

08:52.358 --> 08:57.422
- What kind of stupid question
is that, fool? I brought the cake.
- But we already have a cake.

08:57.517 --> 08:59.883
Well, you got another one.

08:59.972 --> 09:03.414
I see.
Well, take your cake...

09:03.508 --> 09:07.330
and put it on the back table
behind my buffet.

09:07.419 --> 09:09.406
And here.

09:10.747 --> 09:14.521
Serve these drinks to the guests
on your way out.

09:35.085 --> 09:38.492
- Hey!
- Hi!

09:38.579 --> 09:42.188
What do you think
you're doing back here?
This area's off-limits to guests.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.192
Oh. Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

09:45.277 --> 09:49.016
Nuptial photos. I was just trying
to get a feel for the place, you know?

09:49.105 --> 09:52.133
So that I can choose the best backgrounds
for the portraits later.

09:52.225 --> 09:56.259
Yeah, well, no one's allowed
in the house right now.
We don't want to disturb the bride.

09:56.344 --> 10:01.289
No problem. Could I
just have a picture of you, please?

10:04.040 --> 10:08.110
- Smile!
- [Shutter Clicking, Whirring]

10:17.353 --> 10:21.044
- Hi. How ya doin'? These are for
Miss Taylor. Beautiful, aren't they?
- Huh!

10:21.139 --> 10:24.630
- They're from her best friend, Tracy.
- Uh, nobody's allowed upstairs.

10:24.717 --> 10:28.160
- I will see that she gets them.
- Right.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.657
Thank you.

10:32.746 --> 10:35.823
- Thanks. How's the catering service?
- [Groans]

10:35.908 --> 10:39.978
We can forget about the kitchen,
man. It's guarded. Ain't no way
we're gettin' in back there.

10:40.068 --> 10:42.470
Well, we're not getting in
from the front either.

10:42.565 --> 10:45.677
The goons in the tuxedos are armed.

10:48.306 --> 10:51.299
Here, lady. Tie on a few.

10:56.543 --> 11:00.318
- Well, are you nervous, old boy?
- Now, why in the heck
should I be nervous...

11:00.412 --> 11:04.695
when I'm marryin' someone
who means more to me
than anything ever has?

11:04.781 --> 11:08.354
That Jackie definitely
is one fine woman.

11:08.442 --> 11:12.760
If only her father could have been
here today to share this day with us...

11:13.809 --> 11:16.837
and see how happy his little girl is.

11:19.508 --> 11:21.496
[Knocking]

11:27.787 --> 11:30.153
Got some flowers
for you from Tracy.

11:30.242 --> 11:32.478
Hey, uh, shouldn't you
oughta be gettin' dressed?

11:32.571 --> 11:34.808
I mean, that wedding's
about to start down there.

11:34.901 --> 11:38.936
Buzz off, clown. I'll get dressed
when I'm good and ready.

11:54.330 --> 11:57.986
[Face]
She's in one of these rooms upstairs.

11:58.074 --> 12:02.937
This trellis should
hold you and Murdock.

12:03.025 --> 12:08.054
[French Accent]
Murdock does not climb trellises.
Murdock is a designer of pastry.

12:08.142 --> 12:10.674
- [Coughs]
- Murdock, are you catching cold?

12:10.763 --> 12:14.797
No. He's coughing because
he ate the shaving cream
off the phoney wedding cake.

12:14.882 --> 12:17.449
- The man is a nut.
- ## [Violins, Accordion]

12:17.544 --> 12:19.532
That's our cue.

12:26.031 --> 12:28.232
Get her... now.

12:30.358 --> 12:33.884
Hey! Finish that
and get on outta here!

13:00.104 --> 13:02.092
[Knocking]

13:05.762 --> 13:08.212
- [Coughing]
- Are you the guys who wrote this note?

13:08.300 --> 13:10.501
- That's right. Tracy hired us
to come and get you.
- Ohh!

13:10.588 --> 13:14.197
- [Knocking]
- [Man] Let"s go, Jackie.
They"re startin" to play the music.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.698
Where is she? Everybody's seated.
We're ready to go.

13:17.785 --> 13:20.483
Eh, she's just takin'
her good ol' time.

13:20.573 --> 13:24.691
Are you sure she's in there?
She ran off once.

13:24.775 --> 13:28.384
- [Coughing]
- Well, it's about time.

13:28.477 --> 13:30.465
[Coughs]

13:44.162 --> 13:46.563
[Coughing Continues]

13:55.228 --> 13:57.713
## ["Here Comes The Bride"]

14:09.581 --> 14:11.569
[Coughing Continues]

14:35.292 --> 14:37.244
## [Ends]

14:37.330 --> 14:41.022
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
to join this man...

14:41.116 --> 14:43.861
- and this woman in holy matrimony.
- [Coughs]

14:47.939 --> 14:52.222
This is the wildest thing l"ve ever done.
You guys are crazy!

14:52.308 --> 14:55.135
Speaking of Murdock,
where is he?

14:55.220 --> 15:00.497
Do you, Jaclyn Leigh Taylor,
take this man, Calvin Cutter,
to be your lawful wedded husband?

15:00.587 --> 15:03.414
Well, I didn't go through all this
to see how I looked in white!

15:06.286 --> 15:10.605
[Screams]
Thanks for coming. I love your dress.

15:12.901 --> 15:15.137
Now, B.A.!

15:15.231 --> 15:17.135
- [Women Screaming]
- [B.A.] Down, suckers!

15:25.424 --> 15:27.376
[Mumbling]

15:28.377 --> 15:31.619
- [Face] Come to me, my precious!
- [Grunting]

15:34.451 --> 15:37.693
You stop her at the front gate.
Come on with me.

15:38.695 --> 15:42.978
I'm a bird, I'm a plane,
I'm a choo-choo train! Wow!

15:43.063 --> 15:45.678
Touchdown!

15:45.767 --> 15:47.755
Waahh!

15:47.848 --> 15:51.173
Can't you hear a woman in distress?
Aah!

16:02.991 --> 16:07.109
Tell Sheriff Gillis to set up
a roadblock on Highway 10!

16:07.193 --> 16:10.849
I don't care how he does it.
I want them stopped!

16:25.665 --> 16:29.866
I wonder why these have to be white?
It's such an impractical colour.
Look how dirty it is already.

16:29.950 --> 16:33.145
It's okay, Murdock.
I doubt you'll need to wear it again.

16:40.392 --> 16:42.924
- You guys are something else!
- Sometimes.

17:01.069 --> 17:04.228
Gee, I thought
the wedding was beautiful.

17:04.314 --> 17:08.172
Tyres exploding everywhere, a cake
that shoots back. The whole thing
right out of Bridal magazine.

17:08.266 --> 17:11.791
The only thing
I didn"t understand is...

17:11.886 --> 17:14.796
why marry a guy
who locks you in your room?

17:14.881 --> 17:16.952
At first, Cal was caring and gracious.

17:17.044 --> 17:20.535
But little by little, I began to suspect
his motives in dating me.

17:20.622 --> 17:25.319
And then my father died, and I inherited
most of his financial empire...

17:25.406 --> 17:27.690
which is what Cal was really after
right from the top.

17:27.778 --> 17:30.523
Then I began to suspect
that he might've killed my father.

17:30.607 --> 17:33.932
Oh, and to think I almost
married into that family.

17:34.018 --> 17:36.301
Couple of months ago,
Calvin started getting mean.

17:36.390 --> 17:39.797
The charm was gone.
All the little jokes.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.913
It was like, in one second
he became another man.

17:43.005 --> 17:45.122
- [Murdock] Sounds like a sociopath.
- A what?

17:45.210 --> 17:48.038
A sociopathic personality is simply
a person who feels no emotion...

17:48.122 --> 17:50.156
no love, no pain, nothin'.

17:50.244 --> 17:52.527
Course, they learn to
fake these things very well.

17:52.615 --> 17:55.644
But they could kill without regard...

17:55.735 --> 17:58.599
and then pass a lie detector test
with impunity.

17:58.689 --> 18:01.469
[British Accent]
You see, aside from being
the A-Team's perennial bride...

18:01.560 --> 18:03.961
I also handle the,
uh, psychological profiles.

18:04.056 --> 18:07.381
But I shan't, uh... I shan't bore you
with my credentials, my dear.

18:07.467 --> 18:10.212
- [Laughs]
- Man, you ain't got no credentials.

18:10.296 --> 18:13.739
Only ones you got is the fact you been
committed to the nuthouse for 10 years.

18:13.832 --> 18:18.234
I can"t believe a man can kill his partner
and get away so easily.

18:18.326 --> 18:22.727
Well, my father had
this one idiosyncrasy:
He tape-recorded his meetings.

18:22.819 --> 18:26.096
He had a tape hidden under his desk.

18:26.189 --> 18:29.265
So if he taped every meeting,
he could have recorded his own murder.

18:29.350 --> 18:32.131
But I've had no way
of getting at the tape.

18:32.221 --> 18:35.747
As soon as my father died,
Calvin took over his office...

18:35.840 --> 18:37.993
so I've no way of getting
in there to find the tape.

18:38.087 --> 18:41.364
I don"t think Calvin knew he had it,
so I don"t think
he thought to look for it.

18:41.457 --> 18:44.569
Well, getting into places
happens to be one of our specialities.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.312
[Police Radio Chatter]

18:51.400 --> 18:53.388
Hey, y'all. Get ready for a detour.

18:55.935 --> 19:00.550
Yeah, uh, let"s go around, B.A. Go slow.
They"re looking for a catering truck.

19:03.132 --> 19:05.203
[Radio Chatter Continues]

19:14.947 --> 19:18.189
You can be sure every dirt road out
of this county is blocked.

19:18.276 --> 19:22.050
May I ask you a question?
In all your father's holdings,
which you now control...

19:22.145 --> 19:26.049
are there any
communication companies?

19:26.139 --> 19:30.836
We have a little newspaper in Austin,
and we own a radio and TV station
here in town...

19:30.923 --> 19:33.159
and a few publishing interests
out of state.

19:33.253 --> 19:36.411
A TV station. How nice.

19:39.826 --> 19:43.400
Well, this is the truck, all right.
Ya know, if they're on foot, we ain't
gonna have too much trouble findin' 'em.

19:43.487 --> 19:47.178
They're not on foot.
Lookee here. Tyre tracks.

19:47.273 --> 19:50.302
- They're not the tyre tracks
from that truck either.
- Hell, they switched vehicles!

19:50.393 --> 19:52.381
Let's go!

20:18.642 --> 20:21.126
- You gotta help me, Pete.
- Jackie!

20:21.221 --> 20:24.049
I need a spot, Pete...
station I.D. break, anything.

20:24.133 --> 20:27.245
Just give me 30 seconds;
15, if that's all you got.

20:27.337 --> 20:30.165
- [Door Shuts]
- What's goin' on here?
I got a report that you were kidnapped.

20:30.249 --> 20:34.615
I loaned our helicopter to the sheriff
to look for the... the kidnappers.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.942
I wasn't kidnapped, Pete,
but I have been held hostage...

20:38.029 --> 20:40.595
and my life has been
threatened by Calvin.

20:40.691 --> 20:45.885
Now, I wanna punch in
and interrupt our broadcast with
an editorial comment on my fiancé.

20:45.975 --> 20:48.719
Oh, no. Now, wait just a minute now.
We can't...

20:48.804 --> 20:51.040
You hard of hearin', sucker?

20:51.133 --> 20:53.500
Uh, j-just a minute.

20:56.334 --> 20:59.611
- [Door Opens, Closes]
- He seem a little edgy to you?

21:00.744 --> 21:04.400
She's down here with a bunch
of real mangy-lookin' characters...

21:04.488 --> 21:07.351
ready to malign you
on public television.

21:07.442 --> 21:11.760
All right, Pete, all right.
Now, you just keep her there.

21:18.009 --> 21:21.500
- Bo, she's at the television station.
- [Receiver Clicks]

21:24.125 --> 21:28.408
So, uh, you doing anything
Saturday night?

21:37.438 --> 21:41.638
Uh-oh. Somebody sold us out.

21:41.723 --> 21:45.414
Now, we gotta get a tape camera
and a recorder. Let's go.

21:48.338 --> 21:52.952
[Hannibal] Too bad the chopper from
the TV station's not here. We could've
used that to get out of the county.

21:53.039 --> 21:54.991
Murdock, grab that camera.

21:55.077 --> 21:59.065
- Right.
- Eh, what are you gonna do, Hannibal?
Shoot home movies?

21:59.154 --> 22:01.142
I've got a plan.

22:29.691 --> 22:32.768
Cutter got this place staked out
like nothin' I've never seen before.

22:32.853 --> 22:36.757
Yeah, it looks like he's got just about
everyone bought or workin' for him.

22:36.847 --> 22:39.509
You got any other great plans, Hannibal?

22:41.673 --> 22:44.536
[Dog Barking In Distance]

22:46.332 --> 22:49.739
Ah, no. That's a horrible plan, Hannibal.
Let me make this real clear.

22:49.827 --> 22:53.234
- I hate this plan.
- Ah, it's just a simple ceremony.

22:53.322 --> 22:56.977
No, no. But it's my ceremony,
and I don't wanna marry her.

22:57.066 --> 23:01.384
Look, buddy, I don't appreciate
your attitude. I'm not exactly a toad.

23:01.476 --> 23:05.677
Look, lady, it don"t have
anything to do with you.

23:05.761 --> 23:08.376
Marriage.
There has to be a better way.

23:08.465 --> 23:14.240
I've explained it to you before.
If we get Jackie in a marriage contract,
Calvin can't touch her.

23:14.331 --> 23:18.271
- If he kills her, you get the money.
- But what if he kills me?

23:18.367 --> 23:21.064
Well, then the orphanage
in your will gets the money.

23:21.154 --> 23:24.479
See, he gets nothing.
It'll freeze him.

23:24.565 --> 23:28.139
I mean, we need an insurance policy,
and you're it.

23:28.226 --> 23:31.090
- Actually, it's brilliant.

Do you, Jaclyn Leigh Taylor...

23:40.957 --> 23:44.945
take Templeton Peck
to be your lawful wedded husband?

23:45.034 --> 23:47.862
I do.

And do you, Templeton Peck...

I now pronounce you man and wife.

toward the junction, then go check out
Four Corners yourself.

Well? What have you got?

25:12.775 --> 25:16.017
I'm sorry, Calvin.
Nothing since they slipped out
of the TV station yesterday.

25:16.103 --> 25:19.546
Well, how in the heck
did they get away?

25:19.639 --> 25:23.958
I want them, Gillis, you hear?
I want their butts bad.

Now, we're bound to find 'em
sooner or later.

- You find 'em.
You find 'em and bring 'em to me.

They better not have gotten out
of the county. He's gonna have us
ground up for sausage.

25:37.445 --> 25:40.604
Nah, no way.
They just must have found
a place to hole up last night.

25:41.897 --> 25:47.340
Rise and shine, ladies. Checkout time
at the Hannibal Hilton is 10.00 a.m.

25:47.430 --> 25:49.548
I can't handle this another night,
Hannibal.

25:49.635 --> 25:53.953
If we get stuck in this county
till tomorrow, I'm taking my chances
and checking into a motel.

25:54.045 --> 25:57.819
- We're not stayin' another night.
- [B.A.] Wanna bet?

25:57.914 --> 26:01.405
I knew I hit somethin' last night
when I turned off the road.

26:03.406 --> 26:06.979
Up and at 'em, Lieutenant.
How was your bridal night?

26:07.067 --> 26:10.013
- Got a busted brake line.
- Yeah? What's it look like?

26:10.104 --> 26:12.802
Like a busted brake line, man.

26:12.891 --> 26:15.127
- Good morning, honey.
- Can you fix it, B.A.?

26:15.221 --> 26:17.919
- Gonna try. Thanks, Hannibal.
- Ah, ah.

26:18.008 --> 26:21.167
- I need those.
- What you need my tools for?

26:21.253 --> 26:25.028
To get my hands on the tape
that'll prove Calvin Cutter's a murderer.

26:25.122 --> 26:29.157
l"m not gonna leave the county
without proof. I want to nail this guy.

26:29.241 --> 26:34.270
The tape recorder's somewhere in the desk.
I know that for sure. I just don't know
if Daddy had it goin' that night.

26:34.358 --> 26:38.595
- We'll find out.
- The tape ain't gonna do us any good
if we can't get outta the county with it.

26:38.685 --> 26:41.134
Looks like I don't
have no wheels.

26:43.802 --> 26:48.287
All was quiet last night, but I
wanna tell ya, that turn-off we took
is real visible in the daylight.

26:48.379 --> 26:51.076
We gotta keep posting
a 24-hour guard.

26:51.166 --> 26:54.775
We don't want a police car
finding us when we're not lookin'.

26:54.869 --> 26:57.022
I'll get back as soon as I can.

26:57.115 --> 27:01.185
Can you bring some food?
Oh, l"m starved.

27:01.275 --> 27:04.766
Yeah. I'll, uh...
I'll get the next watch.

- Uh, Murdock?
- Hmm?

27:07.349 --> 27:10.959
- Can I borrow your hat?
- Sure, Colonel. Would you mind
delivering this for me?

27:11.052 --> 27:15.418
- What is it?
- It's that stupid letter he was writin'
last night, Hannibal. The man is nuts.

27:15.504 --> 27:20.035
He's writin' Cutter a letter,
tellin' him how sorry and bad he feel
for leavin' a man at the altar.

27:24.573 --> 27:27.815
He was lucky to have had you,
a short a time as he did.

27:27.901 --> 27:30.221
Oh, man!

27:30.314 --> 27:34.846
Thank you, Colonel.
It was beautiful of you
to say that. I'm touched.

27:34.932 --> 27:38.009
- You sure are, fool.
- [Allen] And so are you, Hannibal.

27:38.094 --> 27:40.661
Cutter is crazy. Come on.
He killed his partner.

27:40.757 --> 27:45.490
- He's got the cops out lookin' for us,
and you're gonna go to his office.
- Yeah.

28:26.229 --> 28:28.927
- Oh, good morning, Mr Cutter.
- Hold all my calls.

28:29.016 --> 28:33.466
- There haven't been any calls, sir.
The phone lines are out.
- What?

28:33.551 --> 28:38.496
Luckily, somebody reported it last night,
and the repairman just got here.

What are you doing?

28:48.486 --> 28:50.806
This little orange sucker
rolled right under the desk.

28:50.899 --> 28:55.431
How much longer will you be,
do you think? I told you
to be out of here by 9.00.

28:55.517 --> 28:59.008
- Yeah, I heard you.
- I'm really sorry, Mr Cutter.

28:59.095 --> 29:01.580
I, uh... I take it that
you've had no word yet?

29:01.675 --> 29:05.082
No.
Give me and Bo a minute.

29:05.169 --> 29:08.163
- Some coffee?
- [Yells] Get out!

29:08.248 --> 29:11.904
- Please finish up.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:12.991 --> 29:16.848
- What's the word from Gillis?
- [Sniffs] Nothin', I guess.

29:16.943 --> 29:20.019
[Shouting]
Nothin', you guess? "Nothin' I guess"?

29:20.105 --> 29:24.139
How can I use a "nothin' I guess"?
When am I gonna get
the use of my phone back?

29:24.223 --> 29:27.915
Why don't ya put this thing back
together and get outta here!

29:30.339 --> 29:32.327
Well!

29:33.459 --> 29:37.068
I guess I just don't have the knack
of fixin' those things.

29:37.162 --> 29:41.480
Didn't do too well at the catering
business either this weekend.
Loused up your wedding and everything.

Ah, ah.

29:53.762 --> 29:55.749
Just stand still, sonny.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.956
Jackie... Now, what'd you do to her?
'Cause if you've hurt her...

A pretty girl like that?

30:03.205 --> 30:06.613
Hey, she's in terrific shape.

30:06.700 --> 30:09.895
And... she made a lovely bride.

30:09.987 --> 30:11.974
What?

30:15.728 --> 30:17.881
Do you, Jaclyn Leigh Taylor...

30:17.974 --> 30:20.968
take... Templeton Peck...

30:21.053 --> 30:23.963
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

30:24.049 --> 30:26.249
I do.

30:26.337 --> 30:28.656
And do you, Templeton Peck...

30:28.750 --> 30:32.027
take Jackie to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

30:32.120 --> 30:34.272
What is that?

30:34.366 --> 30:36.898
- Her wedding movies.
- Wedding!

Here's a copy of

30:47.513 --> 30:49.500
It was a beautiful ceremony.
Too bad you couldn't make it.

30:49.593 --> 30:52.918
- What is going on?
- You're gonna take the heat off us...

30:53.004 --> 30:55.536
and we're gonna get
out of this county safely...

30:55.625 --> 30:59.991
or that good-lookin' guy on
the videotape there is gonna
take an office down the hall.

31:00.077 --> 31:03.733
And since he now has controlling
interest in Taylor-Cutter Enterprises...

31:03.821 --> 31:07.809
bring me in as
his new administrator.

31:07.898 --> 31:10.383
First thing I'd do
is upgrade the phone system.

31:10.477 --> 31:15.755
Second thing I'd do is fire
the entire executive staff
starting with you.

31:15.844 --> 31:18.672

- She goes with us.

31:23.125 --> 31:26.118

- Oh, I, uh... l... Gee, I-I'm real sorry.

31:57.614 --> 32:01.388
I, uh... I thought you...
What'd you sneak up on me for like that?

32:01.483 --> 32:04.595
I just came to relieve you.
You've been on duty all morning.

32:04.686 --> 32:08.839
You can go join the others.
Ahh, I feel real bad about this.

32:08.930 --> 32:12.456
- I know how uncomfortable
you are around me and all.
- Oh, you kidding?

32:12.549 --> 32:15.081
Don't be ridiculous.
It's, uh... It's nothing.

32:15.170 --> 32:18.247
- Have you ever been married before
in the line of duty?
- No.

32:18.332 --> 32:20.533
No doubt about it,
we're talking a real first here.

32:22.076 --> 32:24.940
Well, I don't think we're
going anyplace for a few hours...

32:25.030 --> 32:27.810
and I'd kinda like to know
a little something
about my husband.

32:34.016 --> 32:36.679
[Bell Ringing]

32:36.762 --> 32:39.709
That's good. Keeping double watch.

32:39.799 --> 32:44.781
Keeps you from dropping
your, uh... guard.

32:44.875 --> 32:48.200
Sorry I'm late, but I had to stop
for some burgers. Come on.

32:48.286 --> 32:51.481
Food? Hannibal, I'm in your debt.

32:51.573 --> 32:54.436

Yeah. Me too.

32:55.442 --> 32:57.595
[Bell Ringing]

33:00.601 --> 33:03.050
- Did you get the tape?
- No, but I know it's there.

33:03.138 --> 33:05.505
- Almost had my hand on it
when I was interrupted.
- Ohh.

33:05.593 --> 33:10.787
- Which means you're going back.
- Well, which means...
Face and I are going back.

33:10.877 --> 33:15.574
- After all, he owns
the stock Cutter's after.
- Just lost my appetite.

33:17.533 --> 33:20.313
I didn't go through all this
to give away my piece
of the company.

33:20.404 --> 33:26.060
[Hannibal] I couldn"t take the tape
when Cutter could see me, otherwise
he" d never let us out of the county.

33:26.145 --> 33:30.594
- That"s gonna come out all right.
- Ain't nothin' gonna work out
without my tools, Hannibal.

33:30.680 --> 33:35.294
Oh, wow!
You went to Hamburger Heaven!

33:35.381 --> 33:38.954
Home of Captain Bellybuster,
America's hero!

33:39.042 --> 33:42.449
Did you get me
a Bellybustin' Surprise Pack, Hannibal?
Did ya, did ya, did ya?

33:42.536 --> 33:44.773
Uh, sorry, Murdock, but...

33:44.866 --> 33:50.274
with six Tummy Tingler malts,
look what you get free.

33:50.358 --> 33:53.387
A Captain Bellybuster cap!

33:53.478 --> 33:56.258
Out of the blue, I'm coming at you.

33:56.349 --> 34:00.667
Super-nutritious and super-delicious!

34:02.173 --> 34:04.871
Hannibal, I can't do nothin'
under there without my tools, man.

34:04.961 --> 34:07.161
Sorry, B.A.
I had to leave 'em behind.

34:07.249 --> 34:12.194
But when I was up in Cutter's building,
I saw something else that'll get us
out of this county.

34:12.283 --> 34:14.684
- Calvin's helicopter!
- No way, man!

34:14.779 --> 34:17.641
B.A., will you relax
and eat your sandwich?

34:17.733 --> 34:21.637
I ain't eatin' none of your food,
Hannibal. Knock me out
and drag me on some helicopter.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.637
B.A., you are getting crazy.

34:24.722 --> 34:26.710
I am, huh?

34:27.967 --> 34:30.038
You got somethin' to say?

34:49.101 --> 34:52.094
- Guess the food didn't agree with him.
- [Allen] Oh, great.

34:52.179 --> 34:56.665
Our only way out of the county is by air,
and our only pilot is now unconscious.

34:56.755 --> 34:58.957
Well, looks like we won't be flyin'.

35:00.584 --> 35:02.785
[Chuckles]

35:09.820 --> 35:12.221
[Grunting]

35:12.316 --> 35:14.387
How'd I do?

35:18.099 --> 35:20.086
[Bo]
They"re here, Cal.

35:21.468 --> 35:25.538
- How you doin', Calvin?
- You got the ownership papers?

35:33.325 --> 35:38.271
By the way,
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Templeton Peck of the Los Angeles Pecks.

35:38.359 --> 35:41.601
I, uh, think you know my wife.

35:41.688 --> 35:43.970
Sore loser.

35:46.181 --> 35:48.582
- Sign.
- Oh.

35:49.758 --> 35:52.125
Um, would you mind if...

35:52.213 --> 35:55.408
Thanks. Excuse me.

35:55.500 --> 35:58.198
Just sign 'em.

35:58.287 --> 36:00.523
[Clears Throat]

36:00.617 --> 36:02.604
Ah! Heh!

36:04.028 --> 36:07.022
[Cutter]
Bo, why don"t ya call Sheriff Gillis?

36:07.107 --> 36:11.343
- Tell him to call off the roadblock.
- [Hannibal]
Oh, l... I wouldn"t bother doing that.

36:11.434 --> 36:13.800
- Uh, Mr Peck.
- Yes, Mr Smith?

36:13.888 --> 36:16.503
I'd hold off signing those papers too.

36:16.592 --> 36:20.662
- Oh, don't get cute with me.
- You're not my type.

36:20.753 --> 36:24.906
There's a little voice in my head that
keeps telling me you didn't get to be
king of this county by dealing straight.

36:24.996 --> 36:27.694
- Get to the chase.
- We'll go on up to the roof.

36:27.784 --> 36:31.641
Then we'll sign the ownership papers,
and you'll loan us your chopper
to fly outta here.

36:31.736 --> 36:35.143
- Hey, no way!
- It's a deal. Let's go.

36:35.231 --> 36:37.053
- Cal!
- Let's go!

36:38.143 --> 36:40.260
[Satisfied Sigh]

36:40.348 --> 36:43.211
Mr Peck.
And don't forget the chopper keys.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.999
- Get the keys.
- [Clicks Tongue]

37:15.045 --> 37:17.328
[No Audible Dialogue]

37:20.827 --> 37:22.780
- Keys, please.
- [Keys Clink]

37:23.823 --> 37:27.727
I guess that does it.
Now you've got the whole company.

37:27.817 --> 37:30.645
We'll write when we get settled in.

37:34.973 --> 37:37.043
Cover 'em!

37:39.091 --> 37:41.126
What'd you get out of my desk?

37:42.461 --> 37:44.449
I didn't do anything.

37:44.541 --> 37:49.357
Well, it seems like your ex-partner
had a very suspicious nature,
so he bugged his office.

37:49.450 --> 37:54.101
He turned on his recorder every time
he was talking to somebody,
like the night he was killed.

37:54.193 --> 37:58.133
Well, you may as well
give me back that tape and the keys.

37:58.229 --> 38:01.506
- You mean these aren't the real keys?
- Oh, they're the real keys all right...

38:01.598 --> 38:03.835
but, uh, you ain't about
to get in that bird, partner.

38:03.928 --> 38:07.335
Oh, these are the real keys, Face.

38:07.423 --> 38:09.624
The real keys.

38:40.747 --> 38:42.983
Get the other keys!

38:59.468 --> 39:02.580
I can't believe this worked.
We're gonna get away!

39:02.672 --> 39:05.997
Consider it a wedding present
to you... and Face.

39:13.239 --> 39:17.061
[Gasps]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, girl.
Take it easy now.

39:17.150 --> 39:19.469
- What's the matter?
- We outta juice.

39:19.562 --> 39:21.845
It was full when we took it
from the TV station.

39:21.934 --> 39:24.253
Yeah, but you never get
good gas mileage in the city.

39:24.347 --> 39:28.204
- Eh, what happens now?
- We going down, boy.

39:39.823 --> 39:41.811
- Tryin' to get us on target.
- What target?

39:47.062 --> 39:49.381
[Bell Dinging]

39:50.515 --> 39:53.792
- You got a map that covers
the entire county?
- [Chopper Door Shuts]

39:53.885 --> 39:56.713
Fill 'er up. High octane.

39:56.797 --> 39:58.998
All right. I'll do it.

40:01.457 --> 40:03.658
Here's the leak.

40:03.745 --> 40:06.360
Took some lead in the old bucket.

40:06.449 --> 40:08.437
Can ya help me?

40:12.107 --> 40:15.349
Oh, it'll only drain again.

40:15.435 --> 40:17.671
Well, we made six miles
from Cutter's building.

40:17.765 --> 40:22.628
- Uh, county line's four from here.
So let's fill 'er up and take another hop.
- Till the tank's drained and we crash again?

40:22.716 --> 40:26.869
As crashes go, this was nothin'.
Wait'll the next one. That'll be a crash.

40:30.745 --> 40:34.319
- Thank you.
- I'm all outta dough. Anybody got any?

40:37.568 --> 40:39.887
Hey! Over there.

40:41.978 --> 40:45.469
I gotta get something.
Uh, Murdock, take care of this man.

40:45.556 --> 40:51.082
I leave with you my
Captain Bellybuster cap for security.
Now, you take good care of it.

40:51.172 --> 40:54.533
I promise you, I will return
for my Captain Bellybuster cap.

41:03.029 --> 41:05.809
[Engine Powering Up]

41:20.669 --> 41:23.414
Get down and stay on "em.

42:25.320 --> 42:28.562
Eh, Murdock?

42:28.648 --> 42:30.884
Murdock, you"re crazy!

42:30.978 --> 42:33.463
That guy"s crazy, Mr Cutter.

42:40.796 --> 42:43.198
[Cutter]
Keep on "em. Don"t loose "em.

42:45.165 --> 42:47.649
[Hannibal]
Enjoying your ride, huh, B.A.?

42:52.362 --> 42:55.936
We can"t let"em get out
of the county with that tape.

43:25.811 --> 43:29.585
[Hannibal]
Murdock, I think you"re
in somebody"s backyard.

43:38.208 --> 43:40.361
[Cutter]
What"s this guy doin"?

43:40.455 --> 43:44.277
[Bo]
He"s tryin" to get me
tangled up in those trees.

44:08.870 --> 44:11.816
Tough luck, fellas.

44:23.306 --> 44:26.169
- Over the county line!
- Naturally.

44:29.463 --> 44:32.492
[Sputtering]
Listen to that! I've never heard her
make a sound like that before.

44:47.852 --> 44:51.792
- [Thudding, Brush Crunching]
- [B.A.] Where are we, man?

44:53.843 --> 44:58.576
Well, that was pretty painless,
considering what I've heard
about divorces.

44:58.669 --> 45:01.911
- That was an annulment, Face.
- Whatever. Of course,
I did take a beating.

45:01.997 --> 45:05.156
Could've taken you
to the cleaners over
a community property settlement.

45:05.242 --> 45:08.816
But then I'd have had to take
you to court, and we all know
how you feel about those.

45:08.903 --> 45:12.015
Well, Face, how does it feel
to be a free man again?

45:12.106 --> 45:15.514
I just wish I didn't have to wear
this cast for another two weeks.

45:15.601 --> 45:18.548
- My foot, it keeps...
- [All] Don't say it!

45:19.637 --> 45:22.334
[Chuckling]

45:29.330 --> 45:31.945
I still owe you guys for crashin' me
in that helicopter.

45:32.034 --> 45:37.016
What're you complaining?
What're you complaining for?
You're the only one who didn't get hurt.

45:37.110 --> 45:39.772
I guess what they say about
not tensing up on impact is true.

45:39.856 --> 45:43.298
- Not to mention he's built like a...
- [Growls]

45:43.392 --> 45:45.841
cute, cuddly, little teddy bear.

45:47.885 --> 45:50.121
Boy, this is really...

45:51.463 --> 45:53.616
irritating.

45:53.709 --> 45:56.194
I can't thank you guys
enough for helpin' me...

45:56.289 --> 46:00.607
gettin"me away,
helpin"me prove Calvin killed my father.

46:00.699 --> 46:02.900
I just wish I could tell people
what y'all have done.

46:02.987 --> 46:07.472
Better not mention our names.
Besides, our testimony would be suspect.

46:07.563 --> 46:12.213
I certainly couldn't testify.
They cannot force a wife
to incriminate her spouse.

46:12.306 --> 46:17.418
I just wish I knew
what a creep that guy was
before I agreed to marry him.

46:17.506 --> 46:19.872
I'm sorry things couldn't have
worked out another way, but, uh...

46:19.961 --> 46:22.362
now that you've dumped your husband,
what are you doing tonight?

46:22.457 --> 46:24.445
Mmm.
[Laughs]

46:24.537 --> 46:26.525
I think things worked out great.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.611
Besides, Face,
you're not the marrying kind.

46:29.696 --> 46:32.855
It would take you about a week
to get the seven-year itch.

46:32.941 --> 46:37.224
- [Hannibal, Allen] Don't say "itch"!
- [Chuckling]
