00:49.848 --> 00:51.148
It's okay.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.918
You're gonna love it.

00:54.019 --> 00:57.187
Happy first day of school.

00:57.189 --> 00:59.054
Bye, sweetie.

00:59.056 --> 01:01.892
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:01.894 --> 01:03.827
Hey. I'm Sam.

01:03.829 --> 01:05.495
Hi. I'm Julie.

01:07.099 --> 01:09.031
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.

01:10.935 --> 01:12.436
I'm Hunter.

01:12.438 --> 01:13.804
Sam's mine right there.

01:13.806 --> 01:15.105
The one with the glasses.

01:15.107 --> 01:16.472
I'm Lisa.

01:16.474 --> 01:18.742
That's my Julie.

01:18.744 --> 01:20.513
I'm Mitchell.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.746
Kayla's hero.

01:23.748 --> 01:25.549
Oh, are you okay?

01:25.551 --> 01:27.082
- Yeah, yeah.
- You crying?

01:27.084 --> 01:29.151
No, man, it's a...
big day, that's all.

01:29.153 --> 01:30.921
- Yeah.
- You know, can I have a tissue, please?

01:30.923 --> 01:31.788
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.522
- It's a big day for all of us.
- Yeah.

01:33.524 --> 01:34.657
Thanks.

01:36.795 --> 01:37.760
Come on, let's go!

01:37.762 --> 01:39.129
I think our daughters
are friends.

01:39.131 --> 01:40.564
- I'm so excited!
- Me, too.

01:40.566 --> 01:43.032
And I think that means
we're friends.

01:46.037 --> 01:48.204
Should we go get a drink?

01:48.206 --> 01:49.573
You okay?

01:49.575 --> 01:50.873
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:50.875 --> 01:52.909
- Yeah.
- Do you guys want to go get a drink?

01:52.911 --> 01:54.978
Just... Ah, they made it.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.813
You guys want to go grab
a drink real quick?

01:56.815 --> 01:58.915
Is he asking us if we want
to go grab a drink?

01:58.917 --> 02:00.484
I'm really hoping it's coffee.

02:10.695 --> 02:12.215
- Aah! That's so...
- Shut the fuck up.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.199
Happy Halloween!

02:17.636 --> 02:19.269
I can see Russia from my house.

02:19.271 --> 02:20.937
- Red Vines!
- Red Vines!

02:20.939 --> 02:22.639
Red Vines!

02:26.879 --> 02:28.078
That's right!

02:31.048 --> 02:33.582
Hey, hey, Hunter, get out, man.

02:35.187 --> 02:37.253
Put your seat belts on!

02:37.255 --> 02:38.622
Oh, my God!

02:41.993 --> 02:43.727
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

02:43.729 --> 02:45.628
No way! Thank you, Mom!

02:45.630 --> 02:48.230
Thank you so much!

02:48.232 --> 02:50.168
Be careful.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.861
Absolutely gorgeous out.

03:18.863 --> 03:20.330
You're probably gonna miss
these mornings

03:20.332 --> 03:21.965
that we spend together, right?

03:21.967 --> 03:24.266
Stop.
You're gonna make me cry.

03:24.268 --> 03:26.336
And I don't want to cry,
because it's prom night.

03:26.338 --> 03:28.170
And it's supposed to be,
like, the most magical night

03:28.172 --> 03:29.338
of your life, and, you know,

03:29.340 --> 03:31.942
I'm just so anxious about it.

03:31.944 --> 03:35.778
Well, call me
if you feel anxious.

03:35.780 --> 03:38.048
Or maybe FaceTime me,
if it wasn't too loud.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.082
I mean, if it was too loud,
you could just...

03:40.084 --> 03:41.617
we could wave or whatever.

03:41.619 --> 03:43.118
That'd be funny.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.789
And then I can do...
You know what I was thinking?

03:45.791 --> 03:47.991
You should send me photos
throughout the night.

03:47.993 --> 03:50.259
Like, not...
not, like, all night long,

03:50.261 --> 03:53.028
but if you could do it
like every 30 minutes or so,

03:53.030 --> 03:55.831
then I can put together
one of those iBooks.

03:55.833 --> 03:56.932
- That would be so fun.
- Yeah.

03:56.934 --> 03:58.168
That would be a really...

03:58.170 --> 03:59.969
I don't think
you would regret that.

04:01.306 --> 04:03.205
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm?

04:03.207 --> 04:06.376
Are you gonna be okay
when I go to college?

04:06.378 --> 04:07.943
Who, me?

04:07.945 --> 04:08.944
Yeah.

04:08.946 --> 04:10.279
Me?

04:12.217 --> 04:13.383
What?

04:13.385 --> 04:14.850
Pl-Please.

04:14.852 --> 04:17.120
Don't even get me...

04:17.122 --> 04:19.088
Don't even...

04:19.089 --> 04:21.326
Please.

04:24.896 --> 04:26.663
Okay, bye, Mom!

04:26.665 --> 04:28.230
- Okay, bye.
- I love you.

04:28.232 --> 04:29.935
Okay, I love you.

04:36.273 --> 04:38.408
<i>Oh, good, you did the laundry.</i>

04:38.410 --> 04:41.677
Yeah, and got a totally sleepy,
happy baby.

04:41.679 --> 04:43.680
Full-blown Renaissance man.

04:43.682 --> 04:45.281
- Oh.
- Believe it.

04:45.283 --> 04:46.882
It's a good thing
she's asleep, too.

04:46.884 --> 04:48.117
I was going through
the laundry.

04:48.119 --> 04:49.952
- Uh-huh.
- Found these new thongs.

04:49.954 --> 04:52.756
You know what I'm gonna do
with these?

04:52.758 --> 04:55.024
Paging Dr. Muff Diver.
Dr. Muff Diver, you're needed

04:55.026 --> 04:56.425
in the O.R. immediately.

04:56.427 --> 04:58.093
Emergency surgery.
Later on tonight,

04:58.095 --> 04:59.663
I'm tearing these off
with my teeth

04:59.665 --> 05:00.863
like an old-school
cartoon billy goat.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.197
Honey.

05:02.199 --> 05:03.668
Mitchell.

05:06.203 --> 05:07.437
Those are your daughter's.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.341
No way. Kayla wears cleats
and Bears jerseys,

05:11.343 --> 05:12.442
not some dirty
stripper underwear.

05:12.444 --> 05:13.410
You thought they were mine.

05:13.412 --> 05:15.310
What, am I giving her allowance
in singles?

05:15.312 --> 05:16.879
Go tell her
she can't wear these.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.348
Tell her
they'll make her sterile,

05:18.350 --> 05:20.182
like with the laptop
and my brother's balls.

05:20.184 --> 05:22.084
We're not sure that's what
happened with your brother.

05:22.086 --> 05:23.952
Honey, you're being ridiculous.

05:23.954 --> 05:25.721
Kayla's becoming a woman.
This isn't the time

05:25.723 --> 05:27.790
to tighten your grip;
it's the time to loosen it.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.858
This? This means
we tighten the grip.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.860
This isn't built for comfort;
it's built for speed.

05:31.862 --> 05:33.396
We need to slow it
the fuck down.

05:33.398 --> 05:36.800
The appliances go in
after the backsplash.

05:36.802 --> 05:39.369
We've done it the same way
every time.

05:41.172 --> 05:43.274
Uh-huh. All right,
put him on the phone.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.976
I'm in the bathroom.

06:09.968 --> 06:11.437
Thanks.
I was looking for that.

06:13.271 --> 06:15.105
You mind telling me
what this is?

06:15.107 --> 06:16.973
- Uh, fuzz.
- Yeah.

06:16.975 --> 06:18.908
Yeah, fuzz.
That's what I thought it was,

06:18.910 --> 06:20.410
and then upon further
investigation,

06:20.412 --> 06:23.011
it is clearly an unraveled
filter of a cigarette.

06:23.013 --> 06:24.514
Kayla, are you a... a smoker?

06:24.516 --> 06:26.182
What? No.

06:26.184 --> 06:28.151
Not a smoker, Dad.

06:28.153 --> 06:31.120
Hey, haven't you seen the
billions of ads that tell you

06:31.122 --> 06:32.922
- not to do this stuff?
- Dad!

06:32.924 --> 06:34.824
You can't teach someone
not to try things, okay?

06:34.826 --> 06:36.893
That's what trying things
is for... to teach you things.

06:36.895 --> 06:38.194
It's a contradiction.

06:38.196 --> 06:40.362
It's like telling me

06:40.364 --> 06:42.499
not to go for a triple
on a base hit to the gap

06:42.501 --> 06:44.199
when I've made a good turn
around first

06:44.201 --> 06:46.122
and I know that the
right fielder has a weak arm.

06:47.905 --> 06:49.372
Damn it, you're smart.

06:49.374 --> 06:51.774
Okay. Yeah, all right.

06:51.776 --> 06:53.175
Time to get ready
for school, Dad.

06:53.177 --> 06:54.543
Okay, all right.

06:54.545 --> 06:56.846
Julie! Sam!

06:56.848 --> 06:57.913
Hey, girl!

06:57.915 --> 06:59.081
Whoa!

07:00.384 --> 07:03.119
- I almost died.
- Prom night!

07:03.121 --> 07:04.553
Prom!

07:04.555 --> 07:06.488
I'm so, so excited.

07:06.490 --> 07:08.057
Oh, me, too.

07:11.562 --> 07:13.129
Mm. I love you.

07:13.131 --> 07:15.230
I love you, too.

07:15.232 --> 07:16.466
All right.

07:16.468 --> 07:17.533
- We're so gross.
- I know.

07:17.535 --> 07:18.968
People are looking at us.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.170
- I don't care.
- We better get

07:20.172 --> 07:21.412
"cutest couple"
in the yearbook.

07:32.583 --> 07:33.583
I'm having sex.

07:34.819 --> 07:35.985
That's great.

07:35.987 --> 07:37.353
I'm having soup.

07:37.355 --> 07:38.487
No.

07:38.489 --> 07:40.557
Tonight with Austin.

07:40.559 --> 07:42.591
- Wait, you're finally gonna do it?
- Yeah.

07:42.593 --> 07:44.827
I mean, you know, we've been
dating for six months,

07:44.829 --> 07:46.295
and we love each other,

07:46.297 --> 07:48.197
and I just awkwardly
got my pediatrician

07:48.199 --> 07:49.598
to put me on birth control.

07:49.601 --> 07:51.567
She gave me a sticker.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.468
Two because I was good, so...

07:53.470 --> 07:55.939
I know it's, like, kind of
corny or whatever, but it just

07:55.941 --> 07:57.607
seems like prom night...

07:57.609 --> 07:59.975
it's kind of perfect, you know?

07:59.977 --> 08:01.476
We're gonna have, like,

08:01.478 --> 08:04.913
dim lighting
and rose petals on the bed

08:04.915 --> 08:07.016
and the scent from that candle
that gets me horny

08:07.018 --> 08:08.483
every time I pass it
in Walgreens.

08:08.485 --> 08:10.052
All candles get me horny.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.420
I'm gonna look
into Austin's eyes,

08:11.422 --> 08:14.223
and then he's gonna look
into mine,

08:14.225 --> 08:16.225
and then we're gonna, like,

08:16.227 --> 08:17.860
touch each other's faces,
you know?

08:17.862 --> 08:19.495
For, like, a long time.

08:19.497 --> 08:21.363
Like, a long time.

08:21.365 --> 08:22.865
Just to, like, connect.

08:22.867 --> 08:25.300
And then we're gonna...

08:25.302 --> 08:26.971
Kapow.

08:28.573 --> 08:30.273
All right, fuck it, I'm in.

08:30.275 --> 08:31.641
- What?
- I'm in.

08:31.643 --> 08:32.908
I'm having sex tonight, too.

08:32.909 --> 08:34.644
Uh... just like that?

08:34.645 --> 08:35.644
Yeah. I mean, why not?

08:35.645 --> 08:37.346
Because it's your first time,

08:37.347 --> 08:40.048
and your first time
should be special and perfect.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.417
Yours can be special
and perfect.

08:41.419 --> 08:45.288
Mine is gonna be tonight
and with that dude.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.990
Yeah, they're just brownies.
They're not, like...

08:46.992 --> 08:49.124
Connor Aldrich?
Your lab partner?

08:49.126 --> 08:51.159
- Yeah. What?
- You haven't even hooked up with him.

08:51.161 --> 08:52.629
You haven't even
seen his thing yet.

08:52.631 --> 08:54.062
What if he has a weird one?

08:54.064 --> 08:55.163
They're all weird.

08:55.165 --> 08:56.932
Penises are not for looking at.

08:56.934 --> 08:58.500
They're for use.
They're like plungers.

08:58.502 --> 09:01.203
Listen, my student athlete days
are over.

09:01.205 --> 09:03.038
Tonight is the beginning
of my adult life,

09:03.040 --> 09:05.607
and for the first time
I can do whatever I want.

09:05.609 --> 09:08.010
So I want to go to prom,
get drunk,

09:08.012 --> 09:11.147
get potted up on weed
and lose my goddamn virginity.

09:11.149 --> 09:13.015
We're gonna have the same
first-time-sex anniversary.

09:13.017 --> 09:14.650
We can go to dinner every year
and commemorate it.

09:14.652 --> 09:16.653
- Olive Garden.
- Yes! Olive Garden.

09:16.655 --> 09:18.221
Breadsticks for life, bitch.

09:18.223 --> 09:20.523
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God, it is gonna be

09:20.525 --> 09:24.096
such a relief to get this over
and done with before college.

09:25.262 --> 09:27.330
Um, no, I mean, like...

09:27.332 --> 09:28.697
No, it's cool.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.332
I just don't think
I'm there yet.

09:30.334 --> 09:32.302
You know, maybe something
might happen tonight

09:32.304 --> 09:35.304
with me and Chad, but, uh,

09:35.306 --> 09:38.243
I don't think sex
is gonna be that thing.

09:45.684 --> 09:46.684
Sam?

09:50.255 --> 09:52.688
But you never know
what could happen.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.191
I mean, maybe
my inner sexual Smaug

09:55.193 --> 09:57.896
will emerge from its keep
and spread its mighty wings.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.397
I never know
what you're talking about.

10:01.399 --> 10:03.365
Yeah, I... me, neither.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.646
Oh, my God.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.328
Julie, is that you?

10:36.034 --> 10:38.067
So realistic.

10:41.238 --> 10:43.374
Ugh. God.

10:46.377 --> 10:48.244
Come on, Sam, we're waiting.

10:48.246 --> 10:50.049
Be right there!

10:51.516 --> 10:53.048
- There she is.
- All right, took me 20 minutes

10:53.050 --> 10:54.484
to figure out how to do
video on this thing,

10:54.486 --> 10:55.585
but I finally got it.

10:55.587 --> 10:57.052
Oh!

10:57.054 --> 10:58.653
Nope. Took a picture of myself.

10:58.655 --> 11:01.023
Siri, video, please.

11:01.025 --> 11:03.326
Wow! That Chad is going to rip

11:03.328 --> 11:05.161
through his little
tuxedo pants.

11:05.163 --> 11:07.096
- Mom. That's gross.
- What?

11:07.098 --> 11:09.197
- Why?
- 'Cause you're practically imagining

11:09.199 --> 11:10.767
your daughter
in sexual congress.

11:10.769 --> 11:12.067
You sicko.

11:12.069 --> 11:13.635
Ah!

11:13.637 --> 11:15.638
I was just trying
to connect with you.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.041
You never talk to us anymore.

11:18.043 --> 11:20.746
- Hey, I got this.
- Okay.

11:24.716 --> 11:26.282
Prom night, huh?

11:26.284 --> 11:29.217
I got sad and reflective
on my prom night, too.

11:29.219 --> 11:30.686
- You were?
- Yeah. I was scared I wasn't

11:30.688 --> 11:32.355
gonna stay friends
with the guys I had

11:32.357 --> 11:34.423
been around most of my life,
but I was able to...

11:34.425 --> 11:35.758
- Hey, baby, I love you so much.
- What?

11:35.760 --> 11:36.826
You just really
freaked her out.

11:36.828 --> 11:38.693
Sweetie, if you're worried

11:38.695 --> 11:41.831
about that at all,
just know you shouldn't be.

11:41.833 --> 11:44.466
You never stay friends
with people from high school.

11:44.468 --> 11:46.201
I mean, the oldest friend
I have is Jan

11:46.203 --> 11:47.736
from work, and I've known her
for three months.

11:47.738 --> 11:49.572
- Who's Jan?
- You know Jan, babe.

11:49.574 --> 11:51.340
She draws those silly cartoons.

11:51.342 --> 11:53.775
- Oh, racist Jan.
- Yeah, that's the one.

11:53.777 --> 11:57.080
Who you are today
is not who you're going to be.

11:57.082 --> 11:58.780
And that's okay.

11:58.782 --> 12:01.249
- That's good therapy.
- And who you become will be

12:01.251 --> 12:03.719
so different that your friends
won't understand you anymore,

12:03.721 --> 12:05.388
and then you will wake up
and realize

12:05.390 --> 12:06.788
these friendships are over.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.791
This feels like
a very painful divorce,

12:08.793 --> 12:10.725
just like the one I had
with your father,

12:10.727 --> 12:12.727
but then you'll find a Frank.

12:12.729 --> 12:15.865
Uh, I appreciate that,
but that's not my deal.

12:15.867 --> 12:18.533
I'm still cool
with a lot of my boys because

12:18.535 --> 12:21.437
on prom night,
me, Dennis, Matt and Cory

12:21.439 --> 12:24.740
all convinced our friend Steve
to join the Army.

12:24.742 --> 12:26.676
He fought
in the Persian Gulf War.

12:26.678 --> 12:28.543
He died right away.

12:28.545 --> 12:30.212
But once you go through

12:30.214 --> 12:32.514
something like that,
you're bonded for life.

12:32.516 --> 12:35.717
The bedrock of deep,
meaningful friendships

12:35.719 --> 12:37.255
is shared experience.

12:38.756 --> 12:41.626
I thought they were gonna
put him in the Reserves.

12:45.262 --> 12:47.766
That is some horseshit.

12:52.804 --> 12:54.372
Hmm.

13:00.777 --> 13:02.845
Wow.

13:02.847 --> 13:04.913
You look so beautiful.

13:04.915 --> 13:07.319
Turn around.

13:08.719 --> 13:11.254
Wow.

13:11.256 --> 13:12.687
Oh, my goodness.

13:12.689 --> 13:14.157
Wow.

13:14.159 --> 13:17.692
So, what's the big plan
for after prom?

13:17.694 --> 13:19.562
Uh, we're just going
to Austin's.

13:19.564 --> 13:20.830
You really like him, huh?

13:20.832 --> 13:22.731
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, he's...

13:22.733 --> 13:24.667
Yeah, he's cool. It's not,
like, serious or anything.

13:24.669 --> 13:27.269
His mom told me
he got into UCLA.

13:27.271 --> 13:29.772
- That's nice.
- Yeah, I mean, it's good.

13:29.774 --> 13:31.874
You remember that time
when, like,

13:31.876 --> 13:34.210
I thought about going to UCLA?

13:34.212 --> 13:36.445
Yes.
That would have been crazy.

13:36.447 --> 13:38.313
That would have been
the worst mistake ever.

13:38.315 --> 13:40.950
I don't think it would have
been that huge of a mistake.

13:40.952 --> 13:43.786
Uh, yes, it would have.

13:43.788 --> 13:45.620
University of Chicago
is perfect.

13:45.622 --> 13:47.956
It's 45 minutes away.

13:47.958 --> 13:51.626
So that way you're gone,
but you're not "gone" gone.

13:51.628 --> 13:53.495
But I'm gone.

13:53.497 --> 13:55.664
Right, but not, like, gone.

13:55.666 --> 13:57.667
Right, but, like,
I'm going to college,

13:57.669 --> 13:59.668
and, like,
I'm not gonna live at home,

13:59.670 --> 14:01.571
so I'm, like... I'm gone.

14:01.573 --> 14:03.371
Mm-hmm.

14:03.373 --> 14:05.942
Why are my boobs so big?

14:05.944 --> 14:07.913
- Ready, Kayla?
- Yup.

14:09.747 --> 14:11.681
And now...

14:11.683 --> 14:13.249
...standing at five foot,
seven inches...

14:13.251 --> 14:14.749
five, nine if you count
the heels...

14:14.751 --> 14:17.352
straight out
of Great Lakes High School,

14:17.354 --> 14:19.455
the prettiest girl
in all of prom...

14:19.457 --> 14:21.624
Kayla Mannes!

14:24.896 --> 14:27.596
Uh... just high fives
from now on.

14:27.598 --> 14:29.365
- Okay.
- Oh, honey, I never thought

14:29.367 --> 14:30.666
I'd see you in a dress.

14:30.668 --> 14:32.601
Technically,
it's not a full dress.

14:32.603 --> 14:34.537
Some material is missing
from the middle there.

14:34.539 --> 14:35.571
Okay.

14:35.573 --> 14:36.605
You look great.

14:36.607 --> 14:37.740
All right.

14:37.742 --> 14:38.975
Yeah, I think it's time to go.

14:38.977 --> 14:39.975
Yes. Yeah.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.543
Honey, we got to go.

14:41.545 --> 14:43.278
Honey?

14:43.280 --> 14:45.380
Dad, are you okay?

14:45.382 --> 14:48.451
It's like when
he watched <i>Frozen.</i>

14:48.453 --> 14:49.552
Come on.

14:51.389 --> 14:52.955
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

14:52.957 --> 14:53.990
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

14:53.992 --> 14:54.990
Oh, Sam.

14:54.992 --> 14:56.259
Hi, Marcie.

14:56.261 --> 14:57.826
Oh. Oh, oh.

14:57.828 --> 14:59.595
- Hey, Mitchell.
- Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.

14:59.597 --> 15:01.029
- Yeah.
- You know, I was worried

15:01.031 --> 15:03.265
when I never heard back
from you about hot yoga.

15:03.267 --> 15:04.533
Called you a bunch of times.

15:04.535 --> 15:07.036
- I ended up having to eat that two-for-one Groupon.
- Oh, yeah.

15:07.038 --> 15:08.671
I don't really do
the hot yoga thing.

15:08.673 --> 15:10.740
- It's just...
- Well, we should catch up, though, right?

15:10.742 --> 15:12.607
- Yeah.
- Like a lunch. I don't know.

15:12.609 --> 15:14.509
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, give me a call.

15:14.511 --> 15:15.845
- I've been calling you.
- Mm-hmm.

15:15.847 --> 15:17.546
Doesn't work.

15:17.548 --> 15:18.817
It's not effective.

15:34.799 --> 15:36.365
I don't even know. Wait, wait, wait.

15:36.367 --> 15:37.767
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.
- You guys, you guys.

15:37.769 --> 15:39.302
Wait, this is, like,
the best lighting

15:39.304 --> 15:40.769
with the Valencia filter,
so wait, wait.

15:40.771 --> 15:42.804
Oh, God. All right, here we go.

15:42.806 --> 15:44.039
- Yeah, okay, that's enough.
- One more.

15:44.041 --> 15:45.474
- We're good.
- Oh, my God.

15:45.476 --> 15:46.875
We need to get
this party started.

15:46.877 --> 15:48.009
- Ooh! Okay, Julie.
- Hmm?

15:48.011 --> 15:49.381
I got you something.

15:50.515 --> 15:51.913
It's coconut oil.

15:51.915 --> 15:53.349
For lube.

15:53.351 --> 15:55.017
I hear it works just as well

15:55.019 --> 15:57.086
and it makes blow jobs
taste like Almond Joy.

15:57.088 --> 15:59.020
Thank God it doesn't
taste like Mounds.

15:59.022 --> 16:01.523
I'd rather eat ten dicks
than one Mound.

16:01.525 --> 16:04.326
- Mm.
- But thank you. That's so sweet.

16:04.328 --> 16:05.227
- Oh!
- Aw!

16:05.229 --> 16:06.895
- Oh, my God, I'm so excited.
- Me, too.

16:06.897 --> 16:08.898
- Oh, my God!
- You have to text me, like, right away.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.732
Oh, my God, we're gonna be
doing it at the same time.

16:10.734 --> 16:12.467
Oh, my God. We have
to talk about it tomorrow.

16:12.469 --> 16:13.536
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, every detail.

16:13.538 --> 16:14.803
- There's gonna be so much to talk about.
- Guys?

16:14.805 --> 16:17.340
Hey, guys.

16:17.342 --> 16:19.708
I want in on this sex pact.

16:19.710 --> 16:22.812
Are you sure? You don't have
to do this just because we are.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.346
No, that's not why.

16:24.348 --> 16:26.916
I want to have sex. Yeah.

16:26.918 --> 16:29.485
That's something
all three of us have in common.

16:29.487 --> 16:30.686
- Mm-hmm.
- Chad is gonna

16:30.688 --> 16:35.023
tap that ass with his penis.

16:35.025 --> 16:38.360
And I doubt we'll have anal
the first time, but...

16:38.362 --> 16:40.629
- All right.
- This is gonna make tonight

16:40.631 --> 16:41.496
- even more perfect.
- Yeah.

16:41.498 --> 16:43.432
- It's gonna be the three of us!
- Yes!

16:44.801 --> 16:46.836
Prom night, motherfuckers!

16:49.406 --> 16:51.773
Yeah! Rudy, it's coming up.

16:51.775 --> 16:52.975
Bear left, bro.

16:52.977 --> 16:54.610
Yeah! Jesus, Rudy.

16:54.612 --> 16:56.846
What the fuck? Yeah!

16:56.848 --> 16:59.615
Oh, my God,
it's my fucking dad.

17:05.556 --> 17:09.424
Yeah! Prom night, bitches!

17:12.128 --> 17:13.395
- Yeah!
- Oh, God, it's him.

17:13.396 --> 17:14.930
Oh, what's up? Yo!

17:20.069 --> 17:22.002
Taio Cruz.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.473
- You got this, girl.
- Don't mess this up,

17:25.474 --> 17:27.942
because that limo
is totally awesome.

17:27.944 --> 17:30.880
Sam. Sam.

17:30.882 --> 17:32.181
Taio Cruz.

17:32.183 --> 17:33.649
Whew!

17:36.186 --> 17:37.586
Sorry.

17:37.588 --> 17:39.188
Sorry. Ho!

17:39.190 --> 17:41.026
Whew!

17:48.198 --> 17:50.199
You're so grown up.

17:50.201 --> 17:51.901
Dad, what are you doing here?

17:51.903 --> 17:54.436
You think I'm gonna miss
the most important night

17:54.438 --> 17:56.672
of your young life?

17:56.674 --> 17:58.207
- That's graduation.
- No.

17:58.209 --> 17:59.708
Graduation's for losers.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.076
Didn't even go
to my graduation.

18:01.078 --> 18:03.578
But prom night...
that's a big one.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.780
Prom was the best night
of my life.

18:05.782 --> 18:07.182
I think about it every day,

18:07.184 --> 18:09.084
and I want you to have
the same experience.

18:09.086 --> 18:10.952
Tonight, you have fun.
You don't worry

18:10.954 --> 18:13.989
about any rules that your mom
or Frank laid down.

18:13.991 --> 18:15.825
No one gives a fuck
about Frank.

18:15.827 --> 18:17.092
All I know is this...
you look amazing,

18:17.094 --> 18:18.626
and I would love
to grab a quick pic.

18:18.628 --> 18:20.829
No. Go stand
with the other parents,

18:20.831 --> 18:22.664
and try to be normal.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.666
Sam, I'm not a normal parent.
I'm not gonna...

18:24.668 --> 18:26.469
Just... I don't even fucking...

18:26.471 --> 18:28.203
- Holy shit, you invited Hunter?
- No, of course not.

18:28.205 --> 18:30.538
I haven't talked to him since
he and Brenda got divorced.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.973
- You know he calls me all the time?
- What?

18:31.975 --> 18:34.042
He wants to play darts.
I don't play darts.

18:34.044 --> 18:35.711
- Darts?
- You kidding me?

18:35.713 --> 18:36.945
- Anyway, I can't hang out with him.
- Oh!

18:36.947 --> 18:38.747
- I'll be guilty by association.
- No, no.

18:38.749 --> 18:40.915
I will never forgive
that babysitter fucker.

18:40.917 --> 18:42.684
- Hey, Hunter.
- Hey, man. Good to see you.

18:42.686 --> 18:43.952
- What up?
- Hey, all right?

18:43.954 --> 18:45.221
Mwah!

18:45.223 --> 18:48.524
Ah.

18:48.526 --> 18:50.058
Did you have another daughter?

18:50.060 --> 18:51.993
I did. I did. Thank you.

18:51.995 --> 18:54.128
- It's... it's been wonderful.
- Yeah.

18:54.130 --> 18:55.498
I'm thinking about
doing that again.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.664
You know,
the whole second round.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.200
I think a lot of dads kind of

18:58.202 --> 18:59.768
get it right
the second time around.

18:59.770 --> 19:01.737
Or, you know, you could

19:01.739 --> 19:03.271
just raise the one
that you have.

19:03.273 --> 19:04.874
Well, I did.
Too late for that.

19:04.876 --> 19:06.775
Raised. Job done.
Hi, honey.

19:06.777 --> 19:08.544
Actually, I heard,

19:08.546 --> 19:10.645
if you spend
a significant amount

19:10.647 --> 19:12.580
of time with your children,
that you develop

19:12.582 --> 19:15.984
some kind of, like,
telekinetic bond with them.

19:15.986 --> 19:18.053
- Is that true?
- I've heard. Mm-hmm.

19:18.055 --> 19:19.788
I hope it's not true,
'cause if it is,

19:19.790 --> 19:22.657
Sam has been looking
at a lot of Asian porn.

19:22.659 --> 19:24.593
My wife's Asian.

19:24.595 --> 19:25.961
Indian.

19:25.963 --> 19:27.195
That's Asian.

19:27.197 --> 19:29.030
This is more like, uh...

19:29.032 --> 19:30.766
It looks like when...
the typical Asian.

19:30.768 --> 19:32.268
- Yep, good seeing you, man.
- Uh, okay.

19:32.270 --> 19:34.111
Good to see you, brother.
You know what I mean.

19:34.838 --> 19:36.538
Who's this guy? Who are you?

19:36.540 --> 19:38.007
Dad, this is my date.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.909
Hi. Uh, it's great
to meet you, sir.

19:39.911 --> 19:41.109
- I'm-I'm Connor.
- Connor and I...

19:41.111 --> 19:42.278
we're in the same
science class.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.179
We're lab partners.

19:43.181 --> 19:44.913
Yeah, we're working
on our chemistry.

19:46.684 --> 19:48.083
Uh...

19:48.085 --> 19:51.653
Um, I'm gonna get a napkin,
if that's cool.

19:51.655 --> 19:54.155
Okay.

19:54.157 --> 19:56.558
Okay, so, uh...

19:56.560 --> 20:00.162
with this, it's, uh, one shot
to the groin, stab and drag.

20:00.164 --> 20:02.664
I refuse to believe
she couldn't do better

20:02.666 --> 20:06.101
- than that loser.
- Oh, I think Chad seems nice.

20:06.103 --> 20:07.236
Chad? No, Chad's amazing.

20:07.238 --> 20:08.938
- Look at that fedora.
- Yeah.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.638
I'm not talking about Chad.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.240
I'm talking about
fucking Frank. What a dick.

20:12.242 --> 20:14.276
Frank does not seem
like a dick to me.

20:14.278 --> 20:16.278
He seems like a nice guy.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.047
And you know what?
Don't blame Brenda.

20:18.049 --> 20:19.847
It's really hard being alone.

20:19.849 --> 20:21.683
Well, let's just agree
to disagree on Frank.

20:21.685 --> 20:23.318
Oh, here they come.
Okay, just be cool.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.621
He's gonna talk about his
tow truck company instantly.

20:25.623 --> 20:28.590
I guarantee you he's gonna
throw that shit in my face.

20:28.592 --> 20:29.791
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

20:29.793 --> 20:30.925
Brenda.

20:30.927 --> 20:32.229
Hunter.

20:33.297 --> 20:34.296
Frank.

20:34.298 --> 20:36.932
- Lisa.
- What'd I do?

20:36.934 --> 20:39.067
I'm sorry. I don't know why I
just said your name like that.

20:39.069 --> 20:40.201
This is so nice. Thank you.

20:40.203 --> 20:41.873
You're welcome.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.607
Okay.

20:45.609 --> 20:47.875
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Lis, Lis, Lis, Lis, Lis.

20:47.877 --> 20:49.377
- I got to go get Julie's wrap.
- Mm.

20:49.379 --> 20:51.346
Were you gonna
let our daughter

20:51.348 --> 20:52.981
take a fucking Lyft to prom?

20:52.983 --> 20:54.650
What is this, Afghanistan?

20:54.652 --> 20:55.917
How'd you pay for that limo,
Hunter?

20:55.919 --> 20:57.318
'Cause I know your credit's
in the shitter.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.854
It is.

20:58.856 --> 21:00.888
'Cause I bought your mom
a wheelchair.

21:00.890 --> 21:02.223
She's gonna pay you back.

21:02.225 --> 21:04.093
With what money, Brenda?
Can she pay me back

21:04.095 --> 21:05.394
with crackers that she steals
from restaurants?

21:05.396 --> 21:06.929
I don't want
to talk about your mom.

21:06.931 --> 21:08.196
I don't want to talk
about her wheelchair.

21:08.198 --> 21:09.698
All I care about
is that my daughter

21:09.700 --> 21:10.833
has the greatest night
of her life.

21:10.835 --> 21:13.001
If it was her greatest night,
you would not be here.

21:13.003 --> 21:14.670
Oh, what a sick burn.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.105
All right,
all right, all right.

21:16.107 --> 21:17.972
- Good.
- Yo, wait, yo, yo. We're all adults here.

21:17.974 --> 21:21.309
Let's not make it uncomfortable
if you're gonna be around more.

21:21.311 --> 21:23.211
- Let's have a beer sometime.
- Okay, first of all,

21:23.213 --> 21:25.213
I don't want to go
to have a beer with you.

21:25.215 --> 21:27.149
I don't want to hang out
with you. I don't like you.

21:27.151 --> 21:28.884
I don't like your wife.
I don't like your guys' deal.

21:28.886 --> 21:30.385
I think it sucks
and it's played out.

21:30.387 --> 21:32.855
Hey, if you ever change
your mind, here's my card.

21:32.857 --> 21:34.757
Ah, here we go.
"Tow with Frank."

21:34.759 --> 21:36.692
Where'd you come up
with that name?

21:36.694 --> 21:38.661
- It's very straightforward.
- All right, I'll tell you this.

21:38.663 --> 21:40.162
The design of that card
is pretty cool.

21:40.164 --> 21:41.864
And my favorite part
is right fucking there.

21:41.866 --> 21:43.702
Oh, God.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.163
Wow, that is just...
No, that's us, Frank.

22:15.165 --> 22:17.132
- You know what?
- I got it. I got it.

22:17.134 --> 22:18.333
You've taken about 15
goddamn selfies.

22:18.335 --> 22:19.768
- Yeah!
- All right.

22:19.770 --> 22:21.303
All right. Cool.

22:21.305 --> 22:22.371
Bye, Mom.

22:22.373 --> 22:24.105
- Have fun, honey. Okay.
- I will.

22:24.107 --> 22:25.339
Bye, Dad.

22:25.341 --> 22:28.143
Remember... stab, turn, drag.

22:28.145 --> 22:29.377
I don't have the knife, Dad.

22:29.379 --> 22:30.580
Yes, you do.
Check your clutch.

22:32.782 --> 22:34.383
Hey, uh, it's been
a pleasure, sir.

22:34.385 --> 22:37.385
I really, um,
it's... I'm honored.

22:37.387 --> 22:38.953
Oh.

22:38.955 --> 22:40.422
Intense, professional grip.

22:40.424 --> 22:41.957
Cheers.

22:41.959 --> 22:43.759
Take it easy, big guy.

22:43.761 --> 22:47.061
Hey, uh, you guys have
a good night, too, you know.

22:47.063 --> 22:48.463
Thank you.

22:48.465 --> 22:50.432
See that smirk?
What was up with that smirk?

22:50.434 --> 22:52.500
You are intense.

22:52.502 --> 22:54.036
- Sam. Hey.
- Oh, hey, Mr. Lockwood.

22:54.038 --> 22:55.104
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

22:55.106 --> 22:57.271
- Chad, yes, come on, man. Bring it in.
- Yes. Oh.

22:57.273 --> 22:58.507
Good. Yeah.

22:58.509 --> 23:00.041
My hat.

23:00.043 --> 23:02.778
- I want to talk to Sam real quick.
- Yeah. Okay.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.047
Uh, let-let me get
a picture real quick. Chad.

23:05.049 --> 23:06.949
- Oh. Okay.
- Real quick photo. Just so fast.

23:06.951 --> 23:08.217
Just don't even fuck
with a filter.

23:08.219 --> 23:09.285
- Just-just plain.
- Okay. Here we go.

23:09.287 --> 23:11.185
- There we go. And there.
- And then you want to get

23:11.187 --> 23:12.488
a quick one of me and Chad
real quick?

23:12.490 --> 23:13.388
- That sounds cool.
- Here you go.

23:13.390 --> 23:14.957
- Okay. - Yep.
- Sammy, here you go, baby.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.191
Real quick.
Just a couple fun ones.

23:16.193 --> 23:17.526
What are we doing?
Uh... like this?

23:17.528 --> 23:19.394
Bros.

23:19.396 --> 23:21.063
Duck lips.

23:21.065 --> 23:23.164
And then just kind of a...

23:23.166 --> 23:24.799
Julie?

23:24.801 --> 23:26.335
Can I talk to you a second?

23:26.337 --> 23:28.237
We got to go. I love you.

23:28.239 --> 23:29.304
I'd really like to talk to you.

23:29.306 --> 23:30.972
But I really gotta go.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.406
Okay, fine.
Just don't forget your wrap.

23:32.408 --> 23:34.009
It's okay.

23:34.011 --> 23:35.778
- I don't think I need it.
- Are you sure?

23:35.780 --> 23:38.513
Because we live in Chicago,
and it's chilly.

23:38.515 --> 23:40.348
I don't know
about other places,

23:40.350 --> 23:43.053
but it gets cold in Illinois.

23:44.821 --> 23:46.288
It's not that cold tonight,
so I don't

23:46.290 --> 23:48.323
- think I need it, okay?
- Okay, Julie, wait.

23:48.325 --> 23:50.858
So you'll call me when you get
to Austin's after prom, right?

23:50.860 --> 23:51.859
Right.

23:51.861 --> 23:53.528
Okay.

23:53.530 --> 23:55.263
- Okay.
- I love you.

23:55.265 --> 23:57.101
Okay. I-I love you.

23:58.269 --> 23:59.801
Okay!

23:59.803 --> 24:01.103
Whew.

24:01.105 --> 24:03.070
Mm. Okay.

24:08.913 --> 24:11.046
This is so cool!

24:11.048 --> 24:12.914
Blow it out!

24:14.385 --> 24:15.851
Chad, I, um...

24:15.853 --> 24:17.086
I saw you do <i>Pippin</i>
last year.

24:17.088 --> 24:19.054
- That was really good. - Oh.
Nice.

24:19.056 --> 24:20.556
Yeah, you're a
really good singer, man.

24:20.558 --> 24:21.958
- What are you doing this year?
- Yeah. Um, we're actually

24:21.960 --> 24:25.059
doing <i>Arnold,</i> which is
an all-male version of <i>Annie.</i>

24:25.061 --> 24:27.395
- Okay.
- Caught you drinking.

24:27.397 --> 24:29.397
Just kidding, y'all.

24:29.399 --> 24:32.901
I may look like a parent,
but I assure you, I am no narc.

24:32.903 --> 24:35.339
Thank you, sir.

24:36.874 --> 24:38.941
Not done yet. Name's Rudy.

24:38.943 --> 24:40.474
I did not go to my prom.

24:40.476 --> 24:42.411
No, my leg was crushed
by a cement truck,

24:42.413 --> 24:44.011
so I could not dance, but...

24:44.013 --> 24:46.214
So I've made it
my mission in life...

24:46.216 --> 24:47.516
well, my whole career...

24:47.518 --> 24:49.550
to make sure
that little kids like you

24:49.552 --> 24:51.920
have a wonderful night
to remember forever.

24:51.922 --> 24:55.524
So just sit back, relax
and enjoy your prom night.

24:55.526 --> 24:57.025
Okay.

24:57.027 --> 24:59.998
Oh, fuck,
that was the turn! Fuck!

25:01.432 --> 25:03.432
Hey, Lis?

25:03.434 --> 25:05.200
You got any S.O.S. pads?

25:05.202 --> 25:07.435
I'm soaking those pans,
but you burnt the shit

25:07.437 --> 25:09.438
out of that mac and cheese,
and...

25:09.440 --> 25:11.874
sponge just isn't gonna cut it.

25:11.876 --> 25:13.642
Thanks for helping clean up.

25:13.644 --> 25:15.443
Don't mention this one.

25:15.445 --> 25:18.413
I mean, Marcie brought the baby
home early, and...

25:18.415 --> 25:20.048
I got to keep busy.

25:20.050 --> 25:23.117
I got to keep my mind off
of Kayla and "Connor."

25:23.119 --> 25:25.921
That's not the right way
to use those.

25:25.923 --> 25:28.155
'Cause his name
is actually Connor.

25:28.157 --> 25:29.426
So...

25:30.961 --> 25:32.493
It's okay.

25:32.495 --> 25:34.630
- UCLA?
- Uh-huh.

25:34.632 --> 25:36.230
I didn't mean to snoop,
but I'm...

25:36.232 --> 25:37.499
No, no. It's okay.

25:37.501 --> 25:39.401
I mean, I don't think
it's a real thing.

25:39.403 --> 25:40.969
She's not actually gonna go.

25:40.971 --> 25:42.904
I think she just applied
for fun.

25:42.906 --> 25:45.240
She didn't... Why?
Have you heard differently?

25:45.242 --> 25:47.942
I would assume it's to go,
but she very well

25:47.944 --> 25:49.912
could have applied ironically.

25:49.914 --> 25:51.313
You... you know millennials,
right?

25:51.315 --> 25:52.948
- Hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And wherever she goes,

25:52.950 --> 25:54.950
you can have a bunch of time
on your hands.

25:54.952 --> 25:56.117
Can figure out
what you want to do

25:56.119 --> 25:57.184
for the back nine of your life.

25:57.186 --> 25:58.386
Uh-huh. Yeah.

26:00.190 --> 26:03.057
I think Julie
left her laptop open.

26:03.059 --> 26:05.093
Julie's doing a lot of texting.

26:05.095 --> 26:07.061
- Mm-hmm.
- Is everything okay?

26:07.063 --> 26:08.997
Maybe we should check to see?

26:08.999 --> 26:10.332
- Peace of mind.
- Yeah.

26:14.938 --> 26:16.305
What the hell is that?

26:16.307 --> 26:18.205
I have no idea.

26:21.377 --> 26:22.644
What are you still doing here?

26:22.646 --> 26:24.278
Hey, your, uh...

26:24.280 --> 26:26.981
your mac and cheese
is messed up.

26:29.485 --> 26:31.720
Are you guys snooping
on your kids?

26:31.722 --> 26:33.521
That is not cool.

26:33.523 --> 26:35.990
No, it's not snooping
if the information shows up.

26:35.992 --> 26:37.124
That's exactly
what snooping is.

26:37.126 --> 26:38.693
No, it's like the Patriot Act.
It's...

26:38.695 --> 26:40.461
Well, it's not like
the Patriot Act.

26:40.463 --> 26:42.230
- It's like snooping.
- Okay, we don't know

26:42.232 --> 26:43.731
what they're talking about,
so...

26:43.733 --> 26:45.099
- What?
- Okay.

26:45.101 --> 26:46.535
Oh, is it like puzzles?

26:46.537 --> 26:48.636
Ooh, ooh! I love puzzles.
Just saw <i>Inferno.</i>

26:48.638 --> 26:50.471
Yeah, great.
What are they saying?

26:50.473 --> 26:52.207
Okay, so there's something
about an eggplant hand...

26:52.209 --> 26:54.041
- handshake.
- Eggplant agreement.

26:54.043 --> 26:56.077
Yeah. They got an agreement
to make eggplant parmesan.

26:56.079 --> 26:57.980
No, eggplants are dicks
in teenage emoji language.

26:57.982 --> 26:59.314
- What?
- You know what, that's true.

26:59.316 --> 27:00.649
Julie told me that...
that the emojis have...

27:00.651 --> 27:02.451
- they all have secret meanings.
- Mm-hmm.

27:02.453 --> 27:05.988
So, like, trees are weed,
and snowflakes are cocaine,

27:05.990 --> 27:08.623
and that thing is "yas queen."

27:08.625 --> 27:10.525
- Yas queen!
- What the hell is that?

27:10.527 --> 27:11.660
- You've never heard of "yas queen"?
- No.

27:11.662 --> 27:12.661
All right, grandpa.

27:12.663 --> 27:14.663
Hold on. Julie is making...

27:14.665 --> 27:17.365
some kind of a dick-related
agreement here.

27:17.367 --> 27:19.601
Kayla is in on the agreement.

27:19.603 --> 27:21.169
- No fucking way.
- "Okay, clown face."

27:21.171 --> 27:23.137
What the fuck does that mean?

27:23.139 --> 27:26.009
That means she's down to clown.

27:27.778 --> 27:28.876
- Okay.
- Three eggplants?

27:28.878 --> 27:31.012
And look at the drool coming
out of that smiley face.

27:31.014 --> 27:31.846
You wish that was drool.

27:31.848 --> 27:32.815
- That's come, my man.
- Stand down.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.017
- It is. Look, it's come.
- He's like...

27:35.019 --> 27:37.051
This is sex
if I've ever seen it

27:37.053 --> 27:39.054
- illustrated in emoji form.
- Oh, no, no, no. Maybe not.

27:39.056 --> 27:40.555
They're best friends.
They're just saying, like,

27:40.557 --> 27:42.524
"You're okay with me.
You're okay to me.

27:42.526 --> 27:44.625
- You're okay to me."
- You say that to your friends?

27:44.627 --> 27:46.060
Whenever I see my friends,
I go,

27:46.062 --> 27:47.229
"Hey, you're okay with me."

27:47.231 --> 27:48.630
- I don't use these.
- Hold on.

27:48.632 --> 27:50.499
Agreement hands,
agreement hands,

27:50.501 --> 27:52.401
agreement hands. This is a...
It's a sex agreement.

27:52.403 --> 27:54.403
They're making a sex pact.

27:54.405 --> 27:56.538
They're gonna lose
their virginity on prom night.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.339
That cannot be a sex pact.

27:58.341 --> 27:59.807
That? That is friendship.

27:59.809 --> 28:02.477
And that is... that is the bond
of friendship

28:02.479 --> 28:04.112
that can never be broken.

28:04.114 --> 28:05.413
I mean, maybe.
- Yeah.

28:05.415 --> 28:07.249
Oh, look, they wrote
"Sex Pact 2018."

28:07.251 --> 28:10.085
I fucking knew it!
I love puzzles.

28:10.087 --> 28:11.619
I told you guys.
Have you seen <i>Inferno?</i>

28:11.621 --> 28:13.355
- Lis, have you seen <i>Inferno?</i>
- Call your kid.

28:13.357 --> 28:14.823
Have you guys seen <i>Inferno?</i>

28:14.825 --> 28:16.691
I figured it out in two
seconds. Did you see <i>Inferno?</i>

28:16.693 --> 28:18.527
The guy jumps off the thing
in the beginning.

28:18.529 --> 28:20.561
He's got a virus. Have you seen
<i>Inferno</i> with Tom Hanks?

28:20.563 --> 28:22.230
Okay. Okay, she's not
answering her phone.

28:22.232 --> 28:23.464
Yeah, Kayla isn't, either.

28:23.466 --> 28:24.732
Okay, what the heck
is happening?

28:24.734 --> 28:26.468
She's always been honest
with me.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.135
She's always told me the truth,

28:28.137 --> 28:30.538
and now I'm just swimming
in a pool of lies.

28:30.540 --> 28:32.173
Okay. Here's what's
gonna happen.

28:32.175 --> 28:34.809
She's gonna have sex
with that Austin kid,

28:34.811 --> 28:37.244
and then she's gonna think
that she has

28:37.246 --> 28:40.382
all these feelings, which she
does not actually have,

28:40.384 --> 28:42.616
then she's gonna drive
across country

28:42.618 --> 28:45.854
and follow him
and ruin her fucking life.

28:45.856 --> 28:47.388
Okay, I think that's
a pretty big

28:47.390 --> 28:48.757
leap to make when you read a...

28:48.759 --> 28:52.227
I have invested
every single piece of my being

28:52.229 --> 28:54.096
into preparing Kayla
for success, and now this?

28:54.098 --> 28:58.633
She is about to have sex with
some dipshit with a "man bun."

28:58.635 --> 29:01.269
You're not using those
in the right way.

29:01.271 --> 29:03.404
Hey, can we all come back
to "planet Earth"?

29:03.406 --> 29:05.173
'Cause this is not a big deal.

29:05.175 --> 29:06.775
They're teenage girls.
They have sex.

29:06.777 --> 29:10.581
Do you, like, freak out when
you see a bee fucking a flower?

29:13.884 --> 29:16.317
- I'm gonna stop her.
- I'm in.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.185
Let's cock-block
those motherfuckers.

29:18.187 --> 29:20.221
Whoa.

29:20.223 --> 29:21.655
No, sir. Uh-uh.
No, no, no, no.

29:21.657 --> 29:23.424
I promised Sam the greatest
night of her life,

29:23.426 --> 29:24.893
and if you guys fuck up
your daughters' night,

29:24.895 --> 29:26.494
it's gonna fuck up
my daughter's night,

29:26.496 --> 29:28.230
and that shit is "not cool."

29:28.232 --> 29:29.631
I don't give a fuck
what's cool with you.

29:29.633 --> 29:31.432
Let's go, Mitchell.
I'll drive.

29:31.434 --> 29:32.800
Hey, hey, hey, wait!
No, no, no.

29:32.802 --> 29:34.201
You want to go?

29:34.203 --> 29:35.569
You're gonna have
to go through me.

29:35.571 --> 29:36.872
Oh, Jesus.

29:36.874 --> 29:38.573
Okay, you called my bluff.
Wait.

29:38.575 --> 29:40.241
Wait! Hey, hey!

29:40.243 --> 29:41.643
- Get off! Get off of me!
- Hey! Hey!

29:41.645 --> 29:43.511
- Get off!
- It's not cool!

29:43.513 --> 29:45.247
"It's not cool!"

29:45.249 --> 29:47.617
Hey! What's the plan?
This is stupid.

29:50.921 --> 29:53.154
Fuck off.

29:53.156 --> 29:55.356
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
What the fuck are you doing?

29:55.358 --> 29:57.659
I just need to talk to
my daughter for five minutes.

29:57.661 --> 29:59.193
Get out of the car!

29:59.195 --> 30:00.694
- You get out. You get out.
- You get out.

30:00.696 --> 30:02.396
- Stop saying what I'm saying.
- Open the door!

30:02.398 --> 30:03.932
- Stop saying what I'm saying.
- Stop saying what I'm saying.

30:03.934 --> 30:05.534
- Stop... Okay, listen, listen.
- Hey.

30:05.536 --> 30:07.201
Lis. Okay, everyone calm down,
calm down.

30:07.203 --> 30:08.737
- But you got to go.
- The-the window.

30:08.739 --> 30:10.605
- No, the window.
- Hey.

30:10.607 --> 30:12.740
What the fuck? No! Holy...

30:15.678 --> 30:16.944
Ah, these are new shorts!

30:16.946 --> 30:18.212
Truce! Truce!

30:18.214 --> 30:19.314
Truce.

30:19.316 --> 30:21.482
Truce, truce, truce.

30:21.484 --> 30:23.218
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.752
Oh, my fucking God.

30:24.754 --> 30:25.754
Aah!

30:26.790 --> 30:27.888
Sorry, man.

30:27.890 --> 30:29.191
It's not gonna work.

30:29.193 --> 30:30.528
You're not Schwarzenegger.

30:32.596 --> 30:34.362
How is that possible?

30:34.364 --> 30:36.230
How is that possible?
Oh, shit.

30:36.232 --> 30:37.798
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh!

30:37.800 --> 30:39.201
Oh, my balls! My balls!

30:39.203 --> 30:40.535
Your ass is so...

30:41.704 --> 30:43.738
- Get...
- Hey! Hey!

30:43.740 --> 30:45.339
- Get out!
- Not cool! Aah!

30:45.341 --> 30:46.775
You're bullying me.

30:46.777 --> 30:47.976
This is bullying.

30:47.978 --> 30:50.377
What you're doing is wrong!

30:50.379 --> 30:52.713
You know your daughter's
in this stupid sex pact, too.

30:52.715 --> 30:55.249
Yeah, and she's not gonna
do anything about it, okay?

30:55.251 --> 30:57.318
Oh, like you would know
what your daughter's gonna do.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.320
Okay, first of all, ouch.

30:59.322 --> 31:00.821
Second of all, I know nothing

31:00.823 --> 31:03.258
is gonna happen with Sam
because...

31:03.260 --> 31:04.826
because she's gay.

31:04.828 --> 31:05.993
Really?

31:05.995 --> 31:07.628
Did she come out to you?

31:07.630 --> 31:08.696
No, of course not.

31:08.698 --> 31:10.298
She barely speaks to me.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.700
Then how do you know?

31:11.702 --> 31:13.000
Because, bro, I'm her dad.

31:13.002 --> 31:15.002
And there's just
some things you know.

31:15.004 --> 31:16.337
Chad is nothing.

31:16.339 --> 31:17.605
He's like a beard.

31:17.607 --> 31:19.540
Or whatever a lesbian beard is.

31:19.542 --> 31:20.608
A merkin?

31:20.610 --> 31:22.009
I don't know. The point is,

31:22.011 --> 31:24.278
I guarantee you
they don't even kiss, okay?

31:24.280 --> 31:25.913
I'm not worried about that.
I'm worried about

31:25.915 --> 31:27.781
you two dicks
fucking up her night.

31:27.783 --> 31:29.984
Okay, well, what you don't
understand is that sex

31:29.986 --> 31:32.519
can be very confusing
for young girls

31:32.521 --> 31:35.490
and make them say things and do
things that they might regret.

31:35.492 --> 31:36.958
Like dropping out of college

31:36.960 --> 31:39.260
to follow around
the Dave Matthews Band

31:39.262 --> 31:40.729
with a guy they think they love

31:40.731 --> 31:42.730
who then winds up
getting them pregnant

31:42.732 --> 31:45.333
and then leaving them
for the girl who makes

31:45.335 --> 31:48.773
grilled cheese sandwiches
with hash aioli on them.

31:49.905 --> 31:51.972
Yeah, that is a...

31:51.974 --> 31:55.676
extremely specific scenario,
and that won't happen to Julie.

31:55.678 --> 31:57.311
Dave's not even touring
right now.

31:57.313 --> 31:58.846
He's taking time off
for fatherhood.

31:58.848 --> 32:00.615
It was me, you idiot.

32:00.617 --> 32:02.616
Me. That happened to me.

32:02.618 --> 32:04.286
Yeah.

32:16.433 --> 32:18.333
You weren't ready.
Okay, one more, one more.

32:18.335 --> 32:19.834
Smile.

32:19.836 --> 32:20.835
I closed my eyes.

32:20.837 --> 32:22.836
Oh, my God.

32:22.838 --> 32:24.972
You guys, this is our song.

32:24.974 --> 32:27.409
Do you remember when we got
snowed in at Sam's

32:27.411 --> 32:28.942
and we played this, like,
over and over?

32:28.944 --> 32:30.412
- Yes!
- We have to dance!

32:30.414 --> 32:31.945
- We have to dance!
- This is our jam!

32:46.396 --> 32:47.528
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.596
- I want a drink.
- Okay.

32:48.598 --> 32:49.631
Yeah, let's go get one.

32:49.633 --> 32:51.732
No, no, no, no. Like, a drink.

32:51.734 --> 32:52.967
Oh, you want a "drink" drink.

32:52.969 --> 32:54.903
- Yeah.
- Okay, let me call my guy.

32:54.905 --> 32:56.604
Hello, Mr. Drink-Drink.

32:56.606 --> 32:59.374
- Let's go get fucked up.
- Okay.

32:59.376 --> 33:01.375
Hey, wait, Kayla, Kayla.

33:01.377 --> 33:02.676
Ah, it's...

33:12.521 --> 33:14.622
Hey, Chad.

33:14.624 --> 33:16.458
I'm gonna go get, uh,
some dessert.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.425
Get me two.

33:28.038 --> 33:30.605
Hey, Angelica,
it's a nice cape.

33:30.607 --> 33:32.374
Oh, hey, Sam.

33:32.376 --> 33:34.608
Thank you.

33:36.613 --> 33:38.880
Um, yeah, it's a...
it's a Galadriel cape

33:38.882 --> 33:41.015
that I made a couple months ago
for LordCon.

33:41.017 --> 33:42.683
Figured I could wear it again.

33:42.685 --> 33:45.119
Not too much overlap
on the guest list.

33:45.121 --> 33:46.855
Yeah.

33:46.857 --> 33:48.856
Yeah, totally.

33:50.493 --> 33:52.527
Who'd you come here with?

33:52.529 --> 33:54.628
Um, just my friends.

33:54.630 --> 33:57.067
Lauren and I broke up.

33:58.402 --> 33:59.534
Oh.

33:59.536 --> 34:01.169
No hard feelings, though.

34:01.171 --> 34:04.575
Um, she's still
a little confused.

34:05.975 --> 34:08.708
How do you think one becomes...

34:08.710 --> 34:11.612
not confused?

34:11.614 --> 34:15.049
It's probably different
for everyone.

34:15.051 --> 34:17.451
But for me, when I kissed
Brad Markowski,

34:17.453 --> 34:18.819
I started to suspect it.

34:18.821 --> 34:20.455
And then last year,
when I touched

34:20.456 --> 34:23.625
Dash Lowenstein's dick,
I was like, "Fuck no."

34:23.627 --> 34:25.859
It was like holding
a dead snake.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.097
Hmm.

34:29.466 --> 34:31.601
But I guess you never know
until you try.

34:40.443 --> 34:42.109
Uh, before I do drink this,
though,

34:42.110 --> 34:43.745
I just want to let you know

34:43.746 --> 34:45.882
that I am fully planning
on having sex tonight.

34:47.516 --> 34:48.982
With... with you.

34:48.984 --> 34:52.020
Yeah, I-I mean,
wherever the wind blows us.

34:52.022 --> 34:54.188
Well, the wind's
gonna blow us there.

34:54.190 --> 34:55.857
Wherever the night takes us,
it's...

34:55.859 --> 34:57.691
It's gonna take your penis
into my vagina.

34:57.693 --> 35:01.529
Okay, uh, you know,
if the universe wills it.

35:01.531 --> 35:03.634
And the universe will will it.

35:05.535 --> 35:07.937
Thanks for
letting me know, I guess.

35:09.205 --> 35:10.738
Oh, yeah.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.607
- Oh, my God.
- I warned you.

35:12.609 --> 35:14.042
- This is what gin tastes like?
- No, no.

35:14.044 --> 35:15.642
I've heard that gin sucks,
and this sucks.

35:15.644 --> 35:16.678
No, it's...

35:16.680 --> 35:19.714
- I made it. Um...
- Oh.

35:19.716 --> 35:21.816
This is so dumb, okay?

35:21.818 --> 35:23.151
Our kids are gonna hate us

35:23.153 --> 35:24.586
because you're gonna
humiliate them.

35:24.588 --> 35:26.488
I'm not gonna humiliate Julie.

35:26.490 --> 35:28.256
We're best friends.
I'm the cool mom.

35:28.258 --> 35:30.158
Hunter, don't make me sit
on your balls again.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.493
Stop, stop, stop it,
stop, stop.

35:32.495 --> 35:35.229
This is how they're gonna
be remembered in high school.

35:35.231 --> 35:38.198
As the weirdos whose parents
dragged them out of prom

35:38.200 --> 35:39.933
because they were afraid
of their sexuality.

35:39.935 --> 35:41.502
It's not something
that should be feared.

35:41.504 --> 35:43.073
It should be celebrated.

35:44.841 --> 35:47.140
And-and-and we have
to empower these young women.

35:47.142 --> 35:48.910
I mean, what year is it, guys?

35:48.912 --> 35:51.245
It's 2018.

35:51.247 --> 35:52.247
Jesus Christ.

35:52.249 --> 35:54.682
- Oh, gross.
- Okay, you know what?

35:54.684 --> 35:56.116
That's an unfortunate
coincidence.

35:56.118 --> 35:57.551
Get a fucking room!

36:05.896 --> 36:07.828
Let's take a picture.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.730
Kayla!
Let's take a picture right now.

36:09.732 --> 36:10.999
- Okay, cool.
- Right now. Right now.

36:11.001 --> 36:12.599
Cheese.

36:12.602 --> 36:15.303
Oh, my God, my mom called me
like 15 times.

36:15.305 --> 36:16.970
- Ooh. Nope.
- She's crazy.

36:16.972 --> 36:18.272
- No, that's a no.
- That's kind of funny.

36:18.274 --> 36:20.841
- Boom. Airplane mode.
- No.

36:20.843 --> 36:23.211
Yeah. We're flying
the friendly skies now.

36:23.213 --> 36:24.745
Yeah, till she freaks out.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.113
Hey, can we please, like,
get out of here?

36:26.115 --> 36:27.915
No. We can't go right now.

36:27.917 --> 36:29.816
They haven't even played
me and Austin's song yet.

36:29.818 --> 36:31.285
How are we gonna get
in the mood?

36:31.287 --> 36:32.720
I don't know,
light your Walgreens candle.

36:32.722 --> 36:35.022
That's later.
Don't you want... Look, look.

36:35.024 --> 36:37.325
Jake Donahue
is just warming up.

36:37.327 --> 36:39.127
Don't you want to see him
break-dance

36:39.129 --> 36:40.662
- and probably hurt himself?
- No.

36:40.664 --> 36:41.830
- It's gonna be so good.
- I don't.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.897
Do you remember
at the Sadie Hawkins Dance

36:43.899 --> 36:45.265
when he tried to do the worm

36:45.267 --> 36:47.167
and he fell
and broke his two front teeth?

36:47.169 --> 36:49.169
- Yeah. He had to go to the hospital.
- I have pictures.

36:49.171 --> 36:51.004
- It was great, and this is gonna be better.
- Mm...

36:51.006 --> 36:52.573
- No, no, no. No!
- So we're staying.

36:52.575 --> 36:54.308
Julie, Julie,
I promise that you're

36:54.310 --> 36:56.611
gonna dance to your song
with your boyfriend tonight.

36:56.613 --> 36:58.312
This place is dying, okay?

36:58.314 --> 37:00.814
- We got to get out of here.
- Okay, fine.

37:00.816 --> 37:03.618
Okay, cool. Let's go.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.352
We're going to the lake house.

37:05.354 --> 37:07.854
I am not sure that this
was worth $85.

37:07.856 --> 37:09.890
- Where's Chad?
- What?

37:09.892 --> 37:11.926
Oh, he's probably out
on the dance floor.

37:11.928 --> 37:14.095
I'm gonna go find him
and meet you guys outside.

37:14.097 --> 37:16.064
- All right.
- Okay.

37:30.613 --> 37:31.981
The fuck?

37:35.385 --> 37:37.919
Smirking little piece of shit.

37:37.921 --> 37:39.886
- Top knot. Top knot.
- Let's get him.

37:39.888 --> 37:41.855
Yeah, you guys go do that.

37:41.857 --> 37:43.924
I'm gonna get some punch.

37:43.926 --> 37:46.727
All right, asshole,
what'd you do with my daughter?

37:46.729 --> 37:48.662
Two of you guys have
the same shitty haircut?

37:48.664 --> 37:49.930
Hey.

37:49.932 --> 37:52.265
Look at me.
My hair's too long.

37:52.267 --> 37:55.803
Hey. You can't go around
assaulting children.

37:55.805 --> 37:59.240
You have to blend in if you
want some information, okay?

37:59.242 --> 38:01.709
So just... just be cool.

38:01.711 --> 38:03.377
God.

38:03.379 --> 38:05.345
Okay.

38:05.347 --> 38:06.683
Julie?

38:07.850 --> 38:08.950
Julie?

38:15.191 --> 38:17.225
Prom night, huh?

38:17.227 --> 38:19.660
What?

38:19.662 --> 38:22.997
Just... just special night.

38:28.138 --> 38:29.873
Got to try.

38:36.278 --> 38:37.814
- Chad?
- Yeah.

38:56.198 --> 38:58.399
This is my moment.

39:14.883 --> 39:17.151
You ruined my moment!

39:17.153 --> 39:19.720
Fuck your moment.

39:19.722 --> 39:20.988
- What happened back there?
- What happened is that...

39:20.990 --> 39:23.991
is that my daughter was kissing
Chad even though she hated it.

39:23.993 --> 39:25.426
And I've been dragged
into this situation

39:25.428 --> 39:27.794
- by you two fucking idiots.
- Just ignore him.

39:27.796 --> 39:29.196
- Great idea.
- We're gonna go to Austin's house.

39:29.198 --> 39:30.832
Julie said that's where
the after-party is,

39:30.834 --> 39:32.799
- and we'll get 'em there.
- And that sounds like a plan.

39:32.801 --> 39:34.134
Hey, how dare you ignore me.

39:34.136 --> 39:35.903
We are in this situation
because you two

39:35.905 --> 39:37.971
raised a couple of bigots
who have shamed my daughter

39:37.973 --> 39:39.506
into losing her virginity
to the wrong sex.

39:39.508 --> 39:41.508
Shame.

39:41.510 --> 39:44.345
My daughter is not a bigot.

39:45.515 --> 39:47.381
We go to all of the marches.

39:47.383 --> 39:50.317
We went to the Tax Day March,
and nobody goes to that shit.

39:50.319 --> 39:52.220
- Nobody.
- Ignore him.

39:52.222 --> 39:53.354
- It's hard.
- Yeah, it is hard.

39:53.356 --> 39:54.522
'Cause I don't quit.

39:54.524 --> 39:56.223
And now I have
to go rescue Sam,

39:56.225 --> 39:58.058
okay, because she is scared
and confused,

39:58.060 --> 40:00.361
and I know what it's like
to be ostracized by society

40:00.363 --> 40:01.995
for your sexual preferences.

40:01.997 --> 40:03.830
Sleeping with women
that aren't your wife

40:03.832 --> 40:05.500
isn't a sexual preference.

40:05.502 --> 40:07.834
No, it is. I prefer them.

40:07.836 --> 40:09.537
How parents can let

40:09.539 --> 40:10.937
their kids play music
this loud.

40:10.939 --> 40:12.807
We all share this planet.

40:12.809 --> 40:14.941
This is how loud I listen
to my music, dawg.

40:14.943 --> 40:16.544
Probably won't even
be able to hear us.

40:17.847 --> 40:19.913
It's so dark in there.

40:19.915 --> 40:21.848
You know, they... okay,
they could be in the backyard

40:21.850 --> 40:22.950
playing two-on-two hoops.
I don't know.

40:22.952 --> 40:23.950
Oh!

40:23.952 --> 40:25.520
Oh, I found a big window.

40:25.522 --> 40:27.821
Oh, no, no, no,
don't, don't, don't.

40:27.823 --> 40:30.491
Trust me. Do not look
in that window.

40:30.493 --> 40:32.125
- What?
- Just look at me. Do not look in this window.

40:32.127 --> 40:33.487
Do not look
in this fucking window.

40:35.097 --> 40:38.165
Julie's red dress.

40:38.167 --> 40:40.336
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

40:43.106 --> 40:46.107
You know, I know... I know this
must be tough for you.

40:46.109 --> 40:50.076
I mean, if... hell, if that
was Kayla in there, I'd...

40:50.078 --> 40:52.379
- I'd-I'd kill myself.
- Nope.

40:52.381 --> 40:54.415
That's the wrong thing
to fucking say right now.

40:54.417 --> 40:56.551
- Stop them. Stop it.
- I can't...

40:56.553 --> 40:57.553
Wait.

40:58.854 --> 41:00.888
Hey. It's not Julie.

41:00.890 --> 41:03.991
- It's not Julie.
- What?

41:03.993 --> 41:05.959
Oh, shit.
It's Austin's parents.

41:05.961 --> 41:07.461
- Good for them.
- They're really...

41:07.463 --> 41:08.895
really going at it.

41:08.897 --> 41:09.897
I always wanted to do this.

41:09.899 --> 41:11.832
I've always wanted
to watch people have sex.

41:11.834 --> 41:13.433
Oh, my God,
he's yanking her hair.

41:13.435 --> 41:15.136
Ow. That looks like it hurts.

41:15.138 --> 41:17.305
Yeah, we shouldn't
be looking, man. Come on.

41:17.307 --> 41:19.473
She runs the risk
of, like, dislocating her hip.

41:19.475 --> 41:21.308
Hey, Mitchell. You're being
a fucking perv, dude.

41:21.310 --> 41:23.009
Don't look.

41:29.051 --> 41:30.317
What happened?

41:30.319 --> 41:32.620
We locked eyes,
and then he finished.

41:32.622 --> 41:35.122
It means his load
is on your soul for eternity.

41:35.124 --> 41:37.124
- Holy shit.
- Oh, shit, he's coming.

41:38.260 --> 41:40.029
I'll pretend I'm a plant.

41:43.633 --> 41:44.932
Mitchell? What are you doing?

41:44.934 --> 41:46.868
- What, Lisa?
- Hey, Ron.

41:46.870 --> 41:48.602
What are you guys
doing out here?

41:48.604 --> 41:49.937
Hi.

41:49.939 --> 41:52.205
- Hey.
- What a nice surprise.

41:52.207 --> 41:53.473
We thought the kids were here.

41:53.475 --> 41:54.642
We didn't realize you guys
were here, uh...

41:54.644 --> 41:56.910
Oh, Cath and I were just having

41:56.912 --> 41:58.546
a little, uh,
prom night role play.

41:58.548 --> 42:01.182
- You know, to keep the sex life alive.
- Prom night.

42:01.184 --> 42:02.316
- That kind of thing.
- Where are the kids?

42:02.318 --> 42:03.283
Um, do you know
where the kids are?

42:03.285 --> 42:06.453
The kids are at
Kyler Montero's lake house.

42:06.455 --> 42:08.589
- How do you know that?
- Because Austin told us.

42:08.591 --> 42:12.158
Yeah. He's texted me
like 19 times tonight.

42:12.160 --> 42:14.662
- Ugh. Oh, my God.
- Yeah, we tell each other everything.

42:14.664 --> 42:17.131
- It's unbelievable.
- I mean, he-he knows about prom night.

42:17.133 --> 42:18.633
- Well, you know.
- I'm sorry, you...

42:18.635 --> 42:21.301
you tell your son about
your sex games with your wife?

42:21.303 --> 42:23.203
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Wow, that's...

42:23.205 --> 42:25.071
- Can't do that.
- Yeah, it's weird.

42:25.073 --> 42:26.640
- It's so... it's-it's weird.
- There's a line.

42:26.642 --> 42:28.642
- We have a very open family here.
- Yes, we do.

42:28.644 --> 42:30.377
- We don't hide anything.
- You know what?

42:30.379 --> 42:31.611
What is Kyler's address?

42:31.613 --> 42:33.980
I-I... Okay, listen,
I-I feel like

42:33.982 --> 42:36.484
I can't betray
Austin's confidence in me,

42:36.486 --> 42:38.653
and frankly,
if Julie wanted to tell you

42:38.655 --> 42:41.254
where the house was,
she would have told you.

42:41.256 --> 42:42.455
- Uh-uh.
- Uh, I got...

42:42.457 --> 42:43.557
Hold on, hold on.
Buh-buh-buh.

42:43.559 --> 42:45.158
Give us the address,

42:45.160 --> 42:46.459
or my giant friend's
gonna tear

42:46.461 --> 42:47.995
- your husband's dick off.
- Yeah.

42:47.997 --> 42:49.562
Uh... no, I'm not.

42:49.564 --> 42:51.299
- No, I'm not. No, no, no.
- Excuse me? - What?

42:51.301 --> 42:53.366
That's... that's good.

42:53.368 --> 42:55.502
And, uh, sorry
to interrupt your evening.

42:55.504 --> 42:58.171
I hope you guys enjoy
the rest of your lovemaking.

42:58.173 --> 42:59.173
- Ow! Fuck!
- Come on.

42:59.175 --> 43:00.274
- What was that about?
- What?

43:00.276 --> 43:01.975
Hey, man, thank you for killing

43:01.977 --> 43:03.511
- my daughter's hymen.
- I don't think so.

43:03.513 --> 43:05.578
Kyler Montero's lake house?
Marcie did the bathroom.

43:05.580 --> 43:08.115
She's gonna know the address,
so let's just go.

43:08.117 --> 43:10.017
- All right, dope.
- Dope.

43:11.521 --> 43:13.520
- Ow, my eyes!
- Yeah!

43:13.522 --> 43:15.990
Okay, come on in now.

43:15.992 --> 43:18.258
It's all fun and games
until there's a decapitation.

43:18.260 --> 43:20.627
I don't need any more
dead girls on my conscience.

43:20.629 --> 43:22.430
I'm sorry, Rudy.

43:22.432 --> 43:25.366
We just had to check that off
the old prom bucket list.

43:25.368 --> 43:27.401
Oh, my God, Sam!

43:27.403 --> 43:29.303
- Come here. Yeah.
- Move, Chad!

43:29.305 --> 43:31.339
- Chad, you want a drink?
- No.

43:31.341 --> 43:33.040
What you got there?

43:33.042 --> 43:35.241
This is a very, very special

43:35.243 --> 43:37.111
reduced hash oil
of my own invention.

43:37.113 --> 43:39.379
It has rosemary essence
for blood flow,

43:39.381 --> 43:40.982
a curcumin extract
from turmeric

43:40.984 --> 43:42.415
to reduce inflammation,

43:42.417 --> 43:44.618
and it gets you super baked.

43:44.620 --> 43:46.687
All right.

43:46.689 --> 43:48.421
Let's do it.
Do I just... I suck?

43:48.423 --> 43:49.656
Yeah, you press the button,

43:49.658 --> 43:51.225
then you take, like,
a little puff.

43:51.227 --> 43:53.426
Or a really, really big one.

43:53.428 --> 43:55.261
Okay.

43:55.263 --> 43:57.698
And then you just hold it
for, like, a beat.

43:57.700 --> 43:59.332
You guys know
that Tanner Dunn's parents

43:59.334 --> 44:00.700
rented out a whole floor

44:00.702 --> 44:02.703
of the Park West Hotel
for an after-party?

44:02.705 --> 44:04.071
What?

44:04.073 --> 44:06.107
Um... yeah, he, uh...

44:06.109 --> 44:08.408
I guess they're super loaded
and they're still proud of him

44:08.410 --> 44:10.544
even though it took him
like six years to graduate.

44:10.546 --> 44:13.046
I remember him.
He got to, uh, miss school

44:13.048 --> 44:15.116
- when his kid was born.
- Yeah, yeah, that guy.

44:15.118 --> 44:17.054
You should definitely
let it go now.

44:20.356 --> 44:21.689
- Holy shit.
- Oh, yeah.

44:21.691 --> 44:23.457
I can run a six-minute mile.

44:23.459 --> 44:25.759
My lung capacity is legit.

44:25.761 --> 44:27.761
- No!
- One more selfie, and this time,

44:27.763 --> 44:29.263
let's pose like Kanye.

44:29.265 --> 44:30.598
- No. Boo!
- Yes.

44:30.601 --> 44:32.599
- You take too many pictures.
- Uh...

44:32.602 --> 44:34.701
They don't look like him.

44:34.703 --> 44:37.604
Ugh, it's just a bunch
of paint samples and swatches.

44:37.606 --> 44:39.506
Hunter, quiet.

44:39.508 --> 44:40.808
Why do I have to be quiet?

44:40.810 --> 44:42.642
Shit would not fly
if Marcie found out.

44:42.644 --> 44:44.178
Who wears the pants
in this house, dawg?

44:44.180 --> 44:46.279
- I do.
- Oh!

44:49.185 --> 44:50.417
Mmm.

44:50.419 --> 44:52.352
This is soy creamer?
Are you sure?

44:52.354 --> 44:54.354
It's pretty freaking rich.

44:54.356 --> 44:56.424
This is so messed up.
Who are you to get involved

44:56.426 --> 44:58.392
in our daughter's sex life?

44:58.394 --> 45:00.560
- Oh, honey, I was just try...
- No, don't "honey" me.

45:00.562 --> 45:03.229
Did your dad try to stop you
when you lost your virginity?

45:03.231 --> 45:04.198
That's totally different.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.066
It is not different.
It's a double standard.

45:06.068 --> 45:08.468
Oh, when a guy loses his
virginity, it-it's no big deal.

45:08.470 --> 45:10.171
It's celebrated,
but if a girl does,

45:10.173 --> 45:12.105
it's some sort of big loss
of innocence?

45:12.107 --> 45:13.607
- Yes.
- But come on, you guys.

45:13.609 --> 45:14.808
It's the same damn thing.

45:14.810 --> 45:16.709
Oh, Marcie!

45:16.711 --> 45:18.678
Stop talking.

45:18.680 --> 45:21.816
- Just give us the address.
- Just give us the address.

45:21.818 --> 45:25.151
Honestly, Lisa, I can't believe
you're on their side.

45:25.153 --> 45:28.154
Side? This is not
some philosophical debate.

45:28.156 --> 45:29.823
We're trying to stop
our daughters

45:29.825 --> 45:32.826
from some kind of sex pact
that they've planned

45:32.828 --> 45:34.861
and not thought through
all the way.

45:34.863 --> 45:35.796
That is such bullshit.

45:35.798 --> 45:38.098
How do you expect society
to treat women

45:38.100 --> 45:40.633
as if they're equal
when their own parents won't?

45:40.635 --> 45:42.502
I don't know about that.

45:42.504 --> 45:44.270
I'll deal with society
tomorrow.

45:44.272 --> 45:46.173
Right now I'm thinking
about my daughter.

45:46.175 --> 45:47.241
Well, that is...
that's convenient.

45:47.243 --> 45:48.441
Yeah. You know what?

45:48.443 --> 45:50.111
Go ahead and be part
of the group

45:50.113 --> 45:51.444
that perceives women as little

45:51.446 --> 45:53.714
damsels in distress
that need saving.

45:53.716 --> 45:55.649
Who cares about us
not getting paid as much

45:55.651 --> 45:57.817
or not having control
of our own bodies?

45:57.819 --> 45:59.486
Can you please not talk to me

45:59.488 --> 46:01.555
like I'm someone
who bombs abortion clinics?

46:01.557 --> 46:02.555
I think
we're a little off topic.

46:02.557 --> 46:03.491
Just... we need the address.

46:03.493 --> 46:06.192
I just can't believe
that you think Julie

46:06.194 --> 46:08.194
shouldn't be free
to explore her sexuality

46:08.196 --> 46:10.196
in the same way that boys are.

46:10.198 --> 46:13.500
Girls and boys
are very different.

46:13.502 --> 46:16.136
Guys will take
whatever's in front of them.

46:16.138 --> 46:18.372
We have these feelings,
and then...

46:18.374 --> 46:21.709
your parents won't let you
see the man.

46:21.711 --> 46:24.812
And then he just
writes a lot of letters,

46:24.814 --> 46:26.379
but you don't get them

46:26.381 --> 46:28.415
because your mom
doesn't give them to you,

46:28.417 --> 46:30.817
and then it starts raining
really hard

46:30.819 --> 46:33.187
'cause he built a house
for you,

46:33.189 --> 46:37.390
and... and then it's...

46:37.392 --> 46:39.593
- Mitchell, did you get the address?
- Yep.

46:39.595 --> 46:40.828
- What?
- I'm really sorry. I'll call you tomorrow.

46:40.830 --> 46:42.763
- I'm just really stressed out.
- It was so good to see you.

46:42.765 --> 46:44.564
Was that <i>The Notebook?</i>

46:44.566 --> 46:47.401
Fucking fuck off, Hunter.
Goddamn it! Mitchell!

46:47.403 --> 46:48.736
I love you. I'm doing this
for our daughter.

46:48.738 --> 46:50.337
- I'll be home late.
- Fucking shit!

46:52.941 --> 46:54.642
To the loss of our innocence.

46:59.682 --> 47:01.415
Oh!

47:01.417 --> 47:02.616
- Come on.
- Ooh!

47:02.618 --> 47:03.917
You guys.

47:03.919 --> 47:05.419
This is the best night.

47:05.421 --> 47:08.555
I am so drunk, super high,

47:08.557 --> 47:10.790
and Connor has a little
something-something

47:10.792 --> 47:13.526
that I feel I need
to go check out.

47:13.528 --> 47:15.895
All right.
It's fuck o'clock.

47:15.897 --> 47:17.666
- No way. You, too?
- Yep.

47:19.468 --> 47:21.701
- These are macarons.
- Ooh.

47:21.703 --> 47:23.671
With a very special
concoction of mine

47:23.673 --> 47:25.573
that I call Wavy Davy.

47:25.575 --> 47:28.308
So it's DMT that I get
from the Dark Web.

47:28.310 --> 47:30.276
Uh, and then there's
a little tiny bit of Xanax

47:30.278 --> 47:32.279
to just kind of take
the edge off, you know.

47:32.281 --> 47:33.279
It's pretty tight.

47:33.281 --> 47:34.881
Mm, sounds pretty tight.

47:34.883 --> 47:36.984
And then I bake it into
a white chocolate macaron,

47:36.986 --> 47:38.618
and it has, like,
a raspberry filling

47:38.620 --> 47:39.886
that's both, uh,
light and fluffy

47:39.888 --> 47:42.323
but also very flavorful
and satisfying.

47:42.325 --> 47:43.890
Are you ready?

47:43.892 --> 47:46.560
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, let's do it.

47:46.562 --> 47:47.694
Okay.

47:47.696 --> 47:49.231
- Mmm.
- Let's go.

47:50.466 --> 47:51.665
Hmm.

47:51.667 --> 47:53.901
It's yum.

47:53.903 --> 47:55.372
Hmm.

47:59.642 --> 48:01.475
Okay, so what do we do?
We just walk in and-and flick

48:01.477 --> 48:03.243
- the lights on and off until the kids come?
- Shh.

48:03.245 --> 48:04.778
Just act cool and young,
and maybe we'll just slip in.

48:04.780 --> 48:06.779
Mitchell, untuck your shirt.

48:06.781 --> 48:08.448
No, it's not
that kind of shirt.

48:08.450 --> 48:09.683
- It looks stupid untucked.
- Untuck your shirt.

48:09.685 --> 48:10.883
You look like a youth minister.

48:10.885 --> 48:11.984
Untuck your fucking shirt, man.

48:11.986 --> 48:13.654
- We're trying to look cool.
- All right.

48:13.656 --> 48:14.955
Whoa, whoa.

48:14.957 --> 48:16.522
Sorry, bro. Sorry, guys.

48:16.524 --> 48:18.359
Sorry. My friend's wasted.

48:18.361 --> 48:20.294
- Don't.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

48:20.296 --> 48:22.562
Hey, hey. No... no adults
are getting into my house.

48:22.564 --> 48:24.732
Not on prom night.
Okay, not on prom.

48:24.734 --> 48:26.299
We were just down the street

48:26.301 --> 48:28.468
at, um, another party,
and then we just decided

48:28.470 --> 48:30.504
to come up here
and hang with you guys.

48:30.506 --> 48:32.506
Um, no parents here, right?

48:32.508 --> 48:33.707
Oh, thank God.

48:33.709 --> 48:34.774
No, not except
for you guys. No.

48:34.776 --> 48:36.276
We're not...

48:36.278 --> 48:38.279
- Yeah, no.
- We don't...

48:38.281 --> 48:39.281
Okay, so you're cops.

48:41.584 --> 48:44.685
I got two DUIs last year.
How could I be a cop?

48:44.687 --> 48:45.919
The police?

48:45.921 --> 48:47.654
Look at my untucked shirt.

48:47.656 --> 48:49.522
You're literally the cop-iest
motherfucker I've ever seen.

48:49.524 --> 48:52.595
You look like you got your hair
cut in the back of a squad car.

48:53.928 --> 48:56.296
This is a regular
men's haircut.

48:56.298 --> 48:57.765
Okay, this is ridiculous.

48:57.767 --> 48:59.366
All right, you're minors,
we're minors.

48:59.368 --> 49:01.334
You're like 45 years old.

49:01.336 --> 49:03.002
Fuck you.
I was born in '77.

49:03.004 --> 49:04.837
'87. '94.

49:04.839 --> 49:07.073
We're gonna drink
with you guys.

49:07.075 --> 49:08.841
Would cops drink
with underage kids?

49:08.843 --> 49:10.444
- No.
- No.

49:10.446 --> 49:12.412
Okay. What about a little
chugging contest?

49:12.414 --> 49:13.781
Um...

49:13.783 --> 49:15.415
Yeah.

49:15.417 --> 49:16.419
Bring it.

49:17.553 --> 49:18.718
Okay, wait.

49:18.720 --> 49:19.986
I got to get the room ready.

49:23.993 --> 49:26.993
Oh, wow.

49:26.995 --> 49:28.462
You're really going for it,
aren't you?

49:28.464 --> 49:29.962
I saw this
in the romantic comedy,

49:29.964 --> 49:31.865
<i>American Beauty.</i>
So good.

49:31.867 --> 49:34.634
You watch the whole thing?

49:38.841 --> 49:40.874
You know what this candle
does to me.

49:40.876 --> 49:42.109
Is that the one
that gives you hives?

49:42.111 --> 49:43.847
- No, it's the good one.
- Oh, nice.

49:47.415 --> 49:49.452
You look so hot right now.

49:59.495 --> 50:01.729
- Where are my chuggers at? You ready?
- Yeah!

50:01.731 --> 50:03.564
- Oh, right here. Let's go.
- Whoot, whoot!

50:03.566 --> 50:05.064
All right.

50:05.066 --> 50:07.133
- Cool.
- Drop 'em.

50:07.135 --> 50:08.304
Let's do it.

50:10.439 --> 50:11.471
Wait, what?

50:11.473 --> 50:12.605
Guys?

50:12.607 --> 50:13.807
We're just chugging, right?

50:13.809 --> 50:14.908
We're butt-chugging.

50:14.910 --> 50:16.377
Yeah, you put the tube
up your butt,

50:16.379 --> 50:17.678
and you funnel the beer in.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.580
Fucks you up way more, man.
Trust me.

50:19.582 --> 50:21.548
- Guys, butt-chugging?
- You got this. You got it.

50:21.550 --> 50:22.883
No, I'm tagging out.
You're in.

50:22.885 --> 50:24.450
- What? Why me?
- You've had a baby.

50:24.452 --> 50:25.651
Everything's looser down there.

50:25.653 --> 50:27.888
I didn't have a baby
out of my butt.

50:27.890 --> 50:29.857
- Even I know that.
- Mitchell.

50:29.859 --> 50:32.859
Okay, this isn't
a common occurrence with me,

50:32.861 --> 50:35.828
but I have had things
up there before.

50:35.830 --> 50:37.964
- Hmm?
- It's just all about breathing.

50:37.966 --> 50:40.734
So just breathe through it
and accept it in.

50:40.736 --> 50:42.870
I can't do it. I can't do it.

50:42.872 --> 50:45.138
Hey! She's up there right now
with that dick-bag Connor

50:45.140 --> 50:46.774
with his man bun
and that stupid smirk.

50:46.776 --> 50:48.011
Think about this.

50:49.745 --> 50:51.412
W-Wait. Connor?

50:51.414 --> 50:53.714
You know... you know
Connor Aldrich, "The Chef"?

50:53.716 --> 50:55.783
Why do they call him
"The Chef"?

50:55.785 --> 50:57.984
Uh, maybe a big fan
of <i>South Park?</i>

50:57.986 --> 50:59.486
"Hello, children."

50:59.488 --> 51:01.622
No, no.
He cooks drugs into everything.

51:01.624 --> 51:03.490
Everything.
Uh, one time he made me

51:03.492 --> 51:05.825
this, like,
acid financier cake. Oh!

51:05.827 --> 51:08.428
That shit was to die for, man.

51:08.430 --> 51:10.430
Like, literally,
I almost fucking died.

51:10.432 --> 51:12.198
Yeah, dude, if your daughter
had anything like that cake,

51:12.200 --> 51:13.921
she might not remember
who you are tomorrow.

51:15.136 --> 51:17.504
Give me the fucking tube.

51:19.441 --> 51:20.741
Let's bone.

51:20.743 --> 51:22.042
Wait, what? Oh.

51:22.044 --> 51:24.681
Are you sure that this
is how you want to do it?

51:26.147 --> 51:27.848
Yes, Chad.

51:27.850 --> 51:29.950
This is always
how I've imagined it.

51:29.952 --> 51:32.519
Oh, you know, I'd rather leave
my shirt on, if that's sexier.

51:32.521 --> 51:35.455
I need another drink.

51:35.457 --> 51:36.492
Wait, wait, uh...

51:38.660 --> 51:40.928
Can you lube it up
with something first?

51:40.930 --> 51:42.495
- Yeah, I'll just spit on it.
- No!

51:42.497 --> 51:44.698
Why? Because I'm a man?
Get over yourself.

51:44.700 --> 51:46.533
No, 'cause you're
fucking gross,

51:46.535 --> 51:48.000
and your fucking
saliva's gross.

51:48.002 --> 51:49.669
I have... I have lip gloss.
I have lip gloss.

51:49.671 --> 51:51.537
- Got a lip gloss. We got a lip gloss.
- Okay, fine. Shit.

51:51.539 --> 51:52.638
I don't have lip gloss.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.241
All right, guys, let's get those tubes in.

51:54.243 --> 51:55.776
All right,
I got the lip gloss on there.

51:55.778 --> 51:56.877
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

51:56.879 --> 51:58.578
- All right.
- Okay, ready?

51:58.580 --> 52:00.214
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

52:00.216 --> 52:01.881
- It's not in yet.
- Okay. - Chill.

52:01.883 --> 52:03.584
So it's just gonna be
on the count of three.

52:03.586 --> 52:05.718
You got this, dawg.
This is for your kid.

52:05.720 --> 52:07.488
- On three. Okay. All right. Yeah.
- On three.

52:07.490 --> 52:08.721
- Okay, one...
- One...

52:08.723 --> 52:11.859
- Oh!
- Are you okay?

52:11.861 --> 52:13.759
- Okay, get your 40s.
- They got a lager and an IPA.

52:13.761 --> 52:15.062
Does it... Doesn't-doesn't...

52:15.064 --> 52:16.596
- It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
- Okay.

52:16.598 --> 52:17.897
- I don't know about this.
- No, no, no, no.

52:17.899 --> 52:19.198
- It's too late. It's already in.
- Here you go.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.566
It's in you.
It's part of you now.

52:20.568 --> 52:22.102
- Ready? Set...
- Yeah.

52:22.104 --> 52:24.971
Chug...!

52:24.973 --> 52:27.573
Butt chug!
Butt chug! Butt chug!

52:27.575 --> 52:28.941
Oh, wait.

52:28.943 --> 52:30.511
- Hey, hey.
- Loosen up.

52:30.513 --> 52:32.645
- It's not working, dude.
- I can't.

52:32.647 --> 52:33.913
- You can hold my hand.
- Okay.

52:33.915 --> 52:35.115
Butt chug! Butt chug!

52:35.117 --> 52:36.850
- Ow!
- You're hurting her.

52:36.852 --> 52:38.118
- That really hurt!
- I'm sorry!

52:38.120 --> 52:39.685
Hey, man, listen.

52:39.687 --> 52:41.955
Channel that energy
into your butthole.

52:41.957 --> 52:43.022
- Breathe.
- This changes everything I know.

52:43.024 --> 52:45.125
Dude, if your daughter
could see you now,

52:45.127 --> 52:46.496
she'd be so proud of you.

52:47.863 --> 52:50.096
Whoa.

52:50.098 --> 52:53.866
I am... I am tripping so hard.

52:53.868 --> 52:55.636
It's not working.
It's not working, dude.

52:55.638 --> 52:57.703
- Oh, it's terrible. Oh.
- It is.

52:57.705 --> 52:58.906
Butt chug! Butt chug!

52:58.908 --> 53:00.841
- Open up.
- No, I'm sorry.

53:00.843 --> 53:03.176
- I-I can't do it, man.
- Focus! For your daughter.

53:03.178 --> 53:04.810
Fuck, Mitch. Focus.

53:04.812 --> 53:06.145
- You gotta breathe.
- You gotta open up, dude.

53:06.147 --> 53:08.615
- Relax.
- I'm relaxed. I'm dilated.

53:08.617 --> 53:11.084
I'm staring at your asshole.
You're not dilated.

53:11.086 --> 53:14.654
Mitchell, you're gonna
lose to this punk bitch?

53:14.656 --> 53:16.790
Breathe. Take it in.

53:16.792 --> 53:18.058
Butt chug!

53:19.761 --> 53:21.093
There we go.

53:21.095 --> 53:22.930
- Okay, good.
- Oh! Oh, it's working!

53:22.932 --> 53:26.133
- It's working! It's working!
- Holy shit! Holy shit!

53:26.135 --> 53:27.834
We're almost halfway done.

53:27.836 --> 53:30.136
Po's! Fucking run!

53:30.138 --> 53:31.638
Cops?

53:31.640 --> 53:33.710
Oh, no!

53:35.678 --> 53:38.111
Ass beer! Oh, oh!

53:38.113 --> 53:39.712
Lisa, the beer went
into my mouth!

53:39.714 --> 53:41.314
I have to go to the hospital!

53:41.316 --> 53:43.917
Hurry up! Get out of here!

53:43.919 --> 53:45.185
Shit.

53:45.187 --> 53:47.087
We got to go.

53:47.089 --> 53:49.288
I got ass beer in my mouth.
I should go to the hospital.

53:49.290 --> 53:51.258
Oh, shit. The fucking cops?

53:51.260 --> 53:52.993
- Fuck.
- The fucking cops are here?

53:52.995 --> 53:54.895
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- I can't get the tube out.

53:54.897 --> 53:56.229
- Pull the tube out.
- Lis, pull it out.

53:56.231 --> 53:58.165
- No. I put it in.
- I had to spit on it!

53:58.167 --> 54:00.133
- What? You spit on it?
- No, it was my lip gloss.

54:00.135 --> 54:01.834
- It was lip gloss.
- Pull it out!

54:01.836 --> 54:03.370
Hey, man, be gentle.
Be fucking gentle, all right?

54:03.372 --> 54:05.004
I'm gonna be gentle,
all right? Ready?

54:05.006 --> 54:06.205
- All right, on three.
- On three.

54:06.207 --> 54:07.674
- One.
- Ow!

54:10.979 --> 54:12.613
- Come on.
- Whoo!

54:12.615 --> 54:15.147
Hey, guys. Guys.

54:15.149 --> 54:16.350
Wait, wait.

54:16.352 --> 54:17.883
Sam?

54:17.885 --> 54:19.752
Sam, Sam! We're over here.

54:19.754 --> 54:21.955
- No! No, I... No.
- She's...

54:21.957 --> 54:23.689
- The night is over.
- No.

54:23.691 --> 54:25.959
It's over. It's done.

54:25.961 --> 54:27.928
The night is not over.

54:27.930 --> 54:29.930
The night has just begun.

54:33.334 --> 54:36.035
Jesus, Chad, use your legs.

54:36.037 --> 54:37.703
I mean, I pretty much
carried her,

54:37.705 --> 54:38.874
like, the whole way there.

54:46.914 --> 54:49.785
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle!

54:50.885 --> 54:52.051
Come on, Sam.

54:52.053 --> 54:53.419
- Come with us.
- I can't.

54:53.421 --> 54:55.187
My car is here.
But all my friends

54:55.189 --> 54:57.223
are going to the hotel party.

54:57.225 --> 54:58.660
Maybe I'll see you later.

55:03.665 --> 55:05.232
Get in the car!
Go, go, go, girl!

55:05.234 --> 55:06.899
- Sam! Seriously, hurry up!
- You'll see her later.

55:06.901 --> 55:08.334
- You'll see her later.
- What are you doing?

55:08.336 --> 55:10.837
Ooh, this night is not over,
I swear to Christ!

55:10.839 --> 55:12.372
Dukes of Hazzard!

55:14.008 --> 55:16.008
Racist-ass show anyway.

55:16.010 --> 55:18.245
- I got the spins, man.
- We got to find our daughter, dawg.

55:18.247 --> 55:19.979
- I'm gonna sit down for a second.
- Rudy!

55:19.981 --> 55:22.716
- It's Rudy. Rudy.
- Rudy, Rudy, wait, wait!

55:22.718 --> 55:24.116
There he goes, there he goes!
Hit the clicker!

55:24.118 --> 55:25.886
- Open the doors!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

55:25.888 --> 55:27.821
- Okay, sit.
- I got mine.

55:27.823 --> 55:29.826
<i>Seat belts!
You'll get a big ticket.</i>

55:32.995 --> 55:34.995
- That's them right there.
- They're getting away.

55:34.997 --> 55:36.263
- You gotta go faster. Hey.
- Okay.

55:36.265 --> 55:38.098
Hey, you gotta be at 110%.

55:38.100 --> 55:39.832
- Okay.
- You got to be in it to win it!

55:39.834 --> 55:41.801
How do you get more competitive
when you're drunk?

55:41.803 --> 55:43.970
Hey, man. I'm more of a winner
when I'm drunk, all right?

55:43.972 --> 55:46.305
- Okay, okay.
- And the question I have

55:46.307 --> 55:48.174
for you, Lis:
Are you a winner?

55:48.176 --> 55:50.042
Are you in it to win it?

55:50.044 --> 55:52.111
- Winning is my bitch!
- All right.

55:52.113 --> 55:53.379
- Strong.
- Knock, knock!

55:53.381 --> 55:55.281
- Who's there?
- Me winning.

55:58.419 --> 56:00.020
It's not...

56:00.022 --> 56:01.821
It's not that good.

56:03.225 --> 56:05.225
I don't... Ow, ow!

56:05.227 --> 56:06.892
- Lisa winning!
- It's not that good.

56:06.894 --> 56:08.861
Ow! Fuck!
All right, it's good.

56:08.863 --> 56:10.397
It's fine. I like it.

56:10.399 --> 56:11.679
<i>Hey, you're losing him.
Let's go.</i>

56:14.236 --> 56:16.502
Not on my watch.

56:18.941 --> 56:21.207
Oh, hey!
- Whoa! - Ow!

56:21.209 --> 56:22.743
Y'all think you gonna outrun

56:22.745 --> 56:24.076
Rudy "The Main
Motherfucking Man" Glover?

56:24.078 --> 56:25.212
Hell no.

56:25.214 --> 56:27.046
- Are you all right?
- No!

56:27.048 --> 56:28.214
Come on.

56:28.216 --> 56:30.015
You okay?

56:30.017 --> 56:32.151
Hey, guys.

56:32.153 --> 56:34.020
Hey, I don't...

56:34.022 --> 56:35.357
I don't feel so...

56:36.925 --> 56:39.225
Oh, my God!

56:39.227 --> 56:40.259
Oh, my God!

56:45.434 --> 56:47.533
<i>All right,
here's what we're gonna do.</i>

56:47.535 --> 56:48.701
Lisa, I have seen every single

56:48.703 --> 56:50.904
- <i>Fast and the Furious</i> movie, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

56:50.906 --> 56:52.805
All of them, dozens of times.
Have you seen any of them?

56:52.807 --> 56:54.908
I saw the Tokyo one,
and I saw the one

56:54.910 --> 56:56.176
where The Rock
punches the torpedo.

56:56.178 --> 56:57.977
Those are the best two to see.

56:57.979 --> 57:01.214
Okay, in times like this,
I ask myself one question:

57:01.216 --> 57:03.783
"WWVDD?"
You know what that means?

57:03.785 --> 57:05.017
"What would Vin Diesel do?"

57:05.019 --> 57:06.553
Holy shit!

57:06.555 --> 57:08.396
No one's ever fucking
gotten that before. Okay.

57:13.495 --> 57:15.098
Oh, man, it smells like...

57:16.330 --> 57:17.464
What we're gonna do...

57:17.466 --> 57:18.531
we're gonna kiss the bumper.

57:18.533 --> 57:19.399
- You give it a little tap.
- Okay.

57:19.401 --> 57:21.033
And then they're gonna
spin and stop,

57:21.035 --> 57:22.803
and we're gonna spin
and stop the other way.

57:22.805 --> 57:24.404
- Okay.
- And we're gonna look at each other,

57:24.406 --> 57:26.339
and we're gonna go,
"It's all about the family."

57:26.341 --> 57:28.575
Wait, I don't feel comfortable
running the kids off the road.

57:28.577 --> 57:31.178
This slow and un-furious
attitude is not helping us.

57:31.180 --> 57:32.479
You have to believe!

57:32.481 --> 57:33.979
Okay, I'm gonna kiss it.

57:33.981 --> 57:35.350
Here we go!

57:36.952 --> 57:38.417
What's that?

57:38.419 --> 57:40.352
- Did I do it?
- No, you didn't even kiss it.

57:40.354 --> 57:41.488
- You gotta kiss it.
- Shit. Okay.

57:41.490 --> 57:43.890
Kiss it for the family.

57:43.892 --> 57:45.895
- Is that Sam?
- Is that Sam?

57:47.863 --> 57:49.930
- Oh! Oh, God!
- She barfed on us!

57:49.932 --> 57:51.497
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

58:02.477 --> 58:04.413
Fuck.

58:07.316 --> 58:09.015
Okay.

58:09.017 --> 58:10.917
Are we in Heaven?

58:10.919 --> 58:13.019
Okay. Listen, I know
how to do this.

58:13.021 --> 58:15.254
Everyone lean backwards.

58:15.256 --> 58:17.256
If we all lean backwards
on three,

58:17.258 --> 58:18.625
the car will roll back.

58:18.627 --> 58:19.926
- Ready?
- Okay.

58:19.928 --> 58:21.294
One...

58:21.296 --> 58:23.129
two... three.

58:24.298 --> 58:27.299
- Oh, fuck...!
- No!

58:27.301 --> 58:28.567
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

58:33.876 --> 58:37.209
Well, that's the last
of the ass beer.

58:37.211 --> 58:39.212
Jesus! That's it. Are you okay?

58:39.214 --> 58:42.381
Are you bleeding? You might
have internal blood injuries.

58:42.383 --> 58:44.584
- I'm all right, I'm all right.
- Here's the problem.

58:44.586 --> 58:47.087
The <i>Fast and the Furious</i>
movies are not realistic.

58:47.089 --> 58:48.287
Where are we?

58:48.289 --> 58:49.589
Shit!

58:49.591 --> 58:50.957
Fuck.

58:53.160 --> 58:54.560
What are you doing?

58:54.562 --> 58:56.363
I heard that in times
of crisis, parents have

58:56.365 --> 58:57.930
- superhuman strength.
- No offense... there's

58:57.932 --> 58:59.633
no scientific way you're gonna
flip that car over.

58:59.635 --> 59:01.634
- I couldn't even do that.
- I couldn't do it, either.

59:01.636 --> 59:04.874
Do not tell me what I can
and can't do.

59:08.209 --> 59:10.075
Kayla's not answering again.

59:10.077 --> 59:11.477
- Goddamn it.
- We lost 'em, guys.

59:11.479 --> 59:12.946
We are fucked!

59:12.948 --> 59:14.450
Or maybe not.

59:17.051 --> 59:19.218
What are you doing?

59:19.220 --> 59:21.220
Trying to telepathically
communicate with Kayla.

59:21.222 --> 59:22.622
I'm with the X-Men of parents.

59:22.624 --> 59:24.156
You know what
my secret power is?

59:24.158 --> 59:25.691
I'm super fucking annoyed
right now,

59:25.693 --> 59:27.529
and I hurt my love handle.

59:31.966 --> 59:33.133
No, no.

59:33.135 --> 59:34.599
Hey.

59:34.602 --> 59:37.037
You guys think my new clothes
go with my fedora?

59:37.039 --> 59:38.571
I'm just kidding.
I know they do.

59:44.312 --> 59:45.647
Hey.

59:47.682 --> 59:50.316
- Have you talked to your mom?
- No.

59:50.318 --> 59:51.951
So, my parents
were just texting me,

59:51.953 --> 59:53.252
and they were having sex,

59:53.254 --> 59:55.323
and your mom showed up
looking for you.

59:56.457 --> 59:58.290
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

59:58.292 --> 59:59.558
It's... it's okay.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.294
They have sex all the time.

01:00:01.296 --> 01:00:02.962
Oh, my God.

01:00:02.964 --> 01:00:04.596
She... The texts.

01:00:04.598 --> 01:00:06.366
So many texts.

01:00:06.368 --> 01:00:08.000
She's mad.

01:00:08.002 --> 01:00:10.303
I need to handle this.

01:00:10.305 --> 01:00:12.037
Good news.
A Lyft is on its way.

01:00:12.039 --> 01:00:14.073
Oh, wait, no, I know this guy.
He sucks.

01:00:14.075 --> 01:00:15.274
Oh, shit. It's Julie.

01:00:15.276 --> 01:00:17.377
- Be-be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool.
- Okay, be quiet.

01:00:17.379 --> 01:00:19.712
- Okay.
- Hey, Mom.

01:00:19.714 --> 01:00:21.448
I just got all your texts,
and I just want

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:22.716
to let you know
that we're all good.

01:00:22.718 --> 01:00:24.049
Cool, cool. Okay.

01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:27.220
Um, are you at the prom?

01:00:27.222 --> 01:00:28.388
Yeah.

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.756
Yeah, just nonstop
magical moments.

01:00:30.758 --> 01:00:32.392
Ha! You are lying to me.

01:00:32.394 --> 01:00:34.093
Where are you right now?
Where are you?

01:00:34.095 --> 01:00:35.261
Why are you freaking out?

01:00:35.263 --> 01:00:36.562
I'm freaking out

01:00:36.564 --> 01:00:38.598
because I know
what you're up to.

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.299
And I know that you
and your friends

01:00:40.301 --> 01:00:43.770
are planning some kind
of little sex pact or whatever.

01:00:43.772 --> 01:00:46.272
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

01:00:46.274 --> 01:00:48.207
How could you possibly know?

01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:51.778
Because I am your mother
and I know you.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.680
- And I know you better than you know yourself.
- Yes.

01:00:54.682 --> 01:00:59.252
And I also know that you're
planning on going to UCLA

01:00:59.254 --> 01:01:01.421
and that you're
following Austin.

01:01:01.423 --> 01:01:03.355
Yeah.

01:01:03.357 --> 01:01:07.463
I... know... everything.

01:01:08.696 --> 01:01:12.165
Oh, my God, you know nothing.

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:14.801
Why do you even assume
that it's me following Austin?

01:01:14.803 --> 01:01:18.404
Huh? You're not worried
about me, Mom.

01:01:18.406 --> 01:01:19.671
You're worried about you.

01:01:19.673 --> 01:01:21.174
You're afraid of losing me.

01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:22.575
You're afraid of being alone.

01:01:22.577 --> 01:01:25.044
I am not scared of being alone.

01:01:26.414 --> 01:01:28.381
This is not about me.

01:01:28.383 --> 01:01:32.451
I have not thought about myself
for the last 18 years.

01:01:32.453 --> 01:01:34.453
This is about you.

01:01:34.455 --> 01:01:38.191
And as a single mother,
I am trying to stop you

01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:40.261
from making
a life-ruining decision.

01:01:41.595 --> 01:01:44.296
So I was a...
a life-ruining decision?

01:01:44.298 --> 01:01:47.100
No. No, of cour...
No, that is not what I meant.

01:01:47.102 --> 01:01:49.334
- No, that is not what I meant.
- You know what, Mom?

01:01:49.336 --> 01:01:52.372
I'm not going to UCLA
because of some boy, okay?

01:01:52.374 --> 01:01:54.741
I'm going to UCLA
because it's the furthest

01:01:54.743 --> 01:01:56.511
I can get from you.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.180
W-Well...

01:02:00.182 --> 01:02:02.649
Hello?

01:02:02.651 --> 01:02:05.618
Nanaru is on his way.

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.256
46 minutes.

01:02:08.856 --> 01:02:12.060
Well, so she hates me.

01:02:14.595 --> 01:02:16.562
She doesn't hate you.

01:02:16.564 --> 01:02:18.298
Kayla's ignoring me.

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.566
She's bringing it
to a whole new level of spite.

01:02:20.568 --> 01:02:22.201
Yeah.

01:02:22.203 --> 01:02:24.169
It's a...
that's a new level of pain.

01:02:24.171 --> 01:02:26.138
Yeah. I know, I know.

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.274
It's just different for me,
because I gave birth to her,

01:02:29.276 --> 01:02:31.343
and I just feel very connected.

01:02:31.345 --> 01:02:33.312
She was living in my body.

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:34.680
- Kayla grew in me.
- Yeah.

01:02:34.682 --> 01:02:36.249
She grew in me. She-she did.

01:02:36.251 --> 01:02:38.884
She grew from my balls,
and I shot her into Marcie.

01:02:38.886 --> 01:02:41.289
This is the same
for you and me.

01:02:42.457 --> 01:02:43.756
Not exactly.

01:02:43.758 --> 01:02:47.192
I mean, you have
daily love in your life,

01:02:47.194 --> 01:02:50.129
and I'm probably gonna
die alone

01:02:50.131 --> 01:02:52.531
and won't be found
for a really long time.

01:02:52.533 --> 01:02:55.468
Until one day,
someone will be walking by

01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:56.803
with their golden retriever,

01:02:56.805 --> 01:02:58.705
and the dog
is just gonna lose its shit,

01:02:58.707 --> 01:03:00.607
and then they're gonna
call the police,

01:03:00.609 --> 01:03:04.611
and then they're gonna come in
and find me draped over the tub

01:03:04.613 --> 01:03:08.281
with my feral cats
eating away at my hair.

01:03:08.283 --> 01:03:09.781
'Cause cats do that.

01:03:09.783 --> 01:03:11.450
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:03:11.452 --> 01:03:13.486
That is some dark shit.

01:03:13.488 --> 01:03:15.287
- You're gonna die alone?
- Oh, oh, oh, oh! My man!

01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:16.855
- My man!
- Where the hell did you get that idea?

01:03:16.857 --> 01:03:17.857
- You know what?
- Come on!

01:03:17.859 --> 01:03:19.392
I call you all the time.

01:03:19.394 --> 01:03:21.160
You ever return my calls? No.

01:03:21.162 --> 01:03:22.861
Because we're not
really friends, you and me.

01:03:22.863 --> 01:03:24.531
We're not friends?

01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:26.533
I don't mean it, uh, that...
I-I... you...

01:03:26.535 --> 01:03:28.801
You know what you are?

01:03:28.803 --> 01:03:31.571
You are like the thing
that pops up on Facebook,

01:03:31.573 --> 01:03:34.506
and then it's, like,
this beautiful picture

01:03:34.508 --> 01:03:37.477
of your grandma who's dead.

01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:39.479
And you're like,
"Fuck you, Facebook,

01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:41.346
for reminding me of my loss."

01:03:41.348 --> 01:03:42.448
That's why you're avoiding me?

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:44.216
Because I remind you of loss?

01:03:44.218 --> 01:03:47.819
Yes. I don't want to be
reminded of sweet, young Julie

01:03:47.821 --> 01:03:50.323
and our kids
and that beautiful time

01:03:50.325 --> 01:03:51.957
- in our lives is over.
- Oh, God.

01:03:51.959 --> 01:03:54.294
Boo-fucking-hoo with you two.

01:03:54.296 --> 01:03:56.495
You guys completely ignore me.

01:03:56.497 --> 01:03:58.531
- Always.
- Yeah, no shit, cheater.

01:03:58.533 --> 01:03:59.966
Oh, cheater? That's my...
that's my designation?

01:03:59.968 --> 01:04:01.734
That's what I am?
I'm the cheater?

01:04:01.736 --> 01:04:03.502
Fuck that shit.

01:04:03.504 --> 01:04:05.872
Did you guys ever once call me
when that went down

01:04:05.874 --> 01:04:07.839
and ask me my side
of the story?

01:04:07.841 --> 01:04:09.676
You didn't.

01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:11.243
I would have
told you the truth.

01:04:11.245 --> 01:04:12.946
I would have told you
that Brenda had stopped

01:04:12.948 --> 01:04:14.580
talking to me
months before that happened.

01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:16.549
You know she hooked up
with her boss

01:04:16.551 --> 01:04:19.319
at a company retreat
in Wisconsin?

01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:20.787
Do you know she beat me up?

01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:22.522
She fucking beat me up

01:04:22.524 --> 01:04:24.756
at a Romano's
fucking Macaroni Grill!

01:04:24.758 --> 01:04:27.526
She fucking slapped me in front
of the fucking maitre d'!

01:04:27.528 --> 01:04:28.727
- I didn't know that.
- I'm sorry, man.

01:04:28.729 --> 01:04:30.729
And I fucking embarrass myself,

01:04:30.731 --> 01:04:32.966
and I embarrass myself
in front of my daughter.

01:04:32.968 --> 01:04:34.399
And I-I-I thought, you know,

01:04:34.401 --> 01:04:35.701
I should pull back
a little bit,

01:04:35.703 --> 01:04:37.002
and then fucking Frank
showed up,

01:04:37.004 --> 01:04:38.937
and he... I pulled back more,

01:04:38.939 --> 01:04:40.839
and I thought,
"One day I'm gonna fix it.

01:04:40.841 --> 01:04:42.609
One day I'm gonna
fucking fix it."

01:04:42.611 --> 01:04:44.509
And then I thought,
if I gave her

01:04:44.511 --> 01:04:49.281
something awesome,
like a great night,

01:04:49.283 --> 01:04:51.517
I could get close
with her again.

01:04:51.519 --> 01:04:53.189
But I can't.

01:04:56.725 --> 01:04:58.558
'Cause she's gone.
They're just...

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.560
The kids, they...

01:05:00.562 --> 01:05:01.928
they just leave.

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:04.596
Oh, shit!
I know how we can find them.

01:05:04.598 --> 01:05:05.964
Go to Cathy and Ron's.

01:05:05.966 --> 01:05:07.533
Austin's been texting them
all night.

01:05:07.535 --> 01:05:09.602
Did you hear anything
I said just now?

01:05:09.604 --> 01:05:11.303
- That's a great idea.
- Fuck it.

01:05:11.305 --> 01:05:12.705
It's just good
to say it out loud.

01:05:12.707 --> 01:05:14.877
- Let's go flip that car.
- Hell...

01:05:15.977 --> 01:05:18.645
Jesus Christ!

01:05:18.647 --> 01:05:21.984
Oh, my fucking God.

01:05:23.385 --> 01:05:24.883
Shit.

01:05:24.885 --> 01:05:27.587
My car just exploded.

01:05:30.357 --> 01:05:32.758
Nanaru is 26 minutes away.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.294
So that's good.

01:05:34.296 --> 01:05:35.662
I thought I canceled him.

01:05:35.664 --> 01:05:37.029
Thanks, Nanaru.

01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:38.430
So Austin's parents
aren't gonna

01:05:38.432 --> 01:05:39.732
just tell us where they are.

01:05:39.734 --> 01:05:41.801
So we need to get Ron's phone,

01:05:41.803 --> 01:05:44.069
read the texts
and find our kids.

01:05:44.071 --> 01:05:45.404
Okay?

01:05:45.406 --> 01:05:47.307
Hunter, it's not gonna be you.

01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:48.774
So, Mitchell, it's you.

01:05:48.776 --> 01:05:50.609
No. That's breaking
and entering.

01:05:50.611 --> 01:05:52.712
That is...
I'm uncomfortable with that.

01:05:52.714 --> 01:05:54.546
Are you a team player,
or aren't you?

01:05:54.548 --> 01:05:55.747
Am I a team player?

01:05:55.749 --> 01:05:57.015
I just chugged a 40
with my asshole.

01:05:57.017 --> 01:05:58.051
I'm a team player.

01:05:58.053 --> 01:05:59.819
Then get your head in the game.

01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:02.421
It's the bottom of the third,
we are down by one,

01:06:02.423 --> 01:06:04.659
and there is not a lot
of game left.

01:06:05.993 --> 01:06:07.759
There is a lot
of game left, though.

01:06:07.761 --> 01:06:09.761
Listen. You have one pass left.

01:06:09.763 --> 01:06:11.698
One. One pass.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.765
- Is it rug... rugby?
- You don't have a limit on passing.

01:06:13.767 --> 01:06:14.834
Is it Australian-rules
football?

01:06:14.836 --> 01:06:16.669
And if it was the third,
I would have the fourth...

01:06:16.671 --> 01:06:17.970
You know what? You know
what's happening right now?

01:06:17.972 --> 01:06:19.738
Let me tell you what's
happening right now.

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.874
Is Kayla and Connor
are sliding into bed.

01:06:21.876 --> 01:06:23.508
He's grabbing a condom,

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:25.645
and then he's flicking it
to the side

01:06:25.647 --> 01:06:27.580
with a smirk on his face.

01:06:27.582 --> 01:06:30.649
That fucking smirk. No way.

01:06:30.651 --> 01:06:31.984
We need a Hail Mary pass.

01:06:31.986 --> 01:06:33.618
Are you up for that, son?

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.087
- Yes, Coach.
- Well, I can't hear you.

01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:36.756
- Yes, Coach. I'm in it.
- I can't hear you!

01:06:36.758 --> 01:06:38.057
I can fucking do this!
Let's go!

01:06:38.059 --> 01:06:39.495
Okay, we gotta...
we gotta be quiet.

01:06:44.131 --> 01:06:45.834
Careful.

01:06:51.472 --> 01:06:52.839
All right, go.

01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:54.443
Go.

01:07:20.401 --> 01:07:21.922
Did you...? Look at that.

01:07:29.676 --> 01:07:30.910
Go out that way.

01:07:30.912 --> 01:07:32.044
There's a person.
There's a person.

01:07:32.046 --> 01:07:33.615
What? Fuck you.

01:07:35.115 --> 01:07:36.751
Jesus Christ.

01:07:49.531 --> 01:07:52.799
I'm gonna get you.

01:07:52.801 --> 01:07:56.535
Not if I get you first.

01:08:02.877 --> 01:08:05.044
No, no. Get away from here.

01:08:05.046 --> 01:08:07.482
- I'm fucking out.
- Mitchell, in. - Get in.

01:08:09.216 --> 01:08:11.850
- Cath?
- Ron, no talking.

01:08:11.852 --> 01:08:14.654
Come on, we had a deal.
We have to find each other

01:08:14.656 --> 01:08:16.656
by sensing each other's musks.

01:08:16.658 --> 01:08:18.057
Can't use our voices.

01:08:36.477 --> 01:08:38.844
Here, kitty, kitty.

01:08:38.845 --> 01:08:40.078
I can smell that musk.

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:49.554
Oh. Yeah.

01:08:49.555 --> 01:08:52.090
Yeah, yeah, I like the sound of that.

01:08:52.091 --> 01:08:53.992
Oh!

01:08:53.993 --> 01:08:55.928
Oh! Hey.

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:58.662
You want to touch first,
that works for Ronnie.

01:08:58.665 --> 01:08:59.965
You want me to touch you?

01:08:59.966 --> 01:09:01.267
- Help yourself.
- You want me to touch you?

01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:03.568
- Yes.
- I'm gonna touch you hard.

01:09:03.569 --> 01:09:06.572
- Do it. Do it.
- How about I touch you with my nails, baby?

01:09:06.573 --> 01:09:08.773
- Let's have it.
- Oh, oh, yeah.

01:09:08.774 --> 01:09:10.510
- Oh, wow.
- Your hair is so sexy, babe.

01:09:10.511 --> 01:09:11.810
Your grip is unbelievable.

01:09:11.812 --> 01:09:13.612
I want you to touch me

01:09:13.613 --> 01:09:14.912
where I like.

01:09:14.915 --> 01:09:16.782
My balls, you know?

01:09:16.783 --> 01:09:19.585
Oh, you'd like me
to touch your balls.

01:09:19.587 --> 01:09:21.853
You want me to touch
your balls, do you?

01:09:21.854 --> 01:09:23.956
- Yes, I do.
- How badly do you

01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:25.558
want me to tug at your balls?

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.859
I want you
to rip them off my body.

01:09:27.861 --> 01:09:29.895
- That's what I want.
- Mm, I don't really believe you.

01:09:29.897 --> 01:09:31.595
I don't believe
you want it bad enough.

01:09:31.598 --> 01:09:33.032
I want it bad. Do it. Come on.

01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:34.966
- Really? How bad?
- I want it so bad that my balls

01:09:34.968 --> 01:09:36.635
- are going to explode.
- Ooh, are they gonna explode

01:09:36.636 --> 01:09:38.770
into a million little pieces?

01:09:38.772 --> 01:09:40.171
Well, let me tell you
something, darling.

01:09:40.173 --> 01:09:41.273
It is your lucky day.

01:09:41.274 --> 01:09:42.675
Because it's Christmas for you.

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:43.876
Let's go.

01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:45.611
Come on. Come on, do it.

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:47.712
- You there?
- What, this isn't hard enough?

01:09:47.714 --> 01:09:49.115
- Let's go. Come on.
- Harder?

01:09:49.117 --> 01:09:50.715
Come on, do it, do it.

01:09:50.716 --> 01:09:52.718
- I'm waiting.
- Okeydokey.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.587
Oh, yeah, you like that?

01:09:55.589 --> 01:09:57.756
Hey, man, I don't judge
people's sex shit.

01:09:57.758 --> 01:09:59.625
That was ridiculous and stupid.

01:09:59.627 --> 01:10:01.059
Way to take one
for the team, guys.

01:10:01.061 --> 01:10:02.728
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Here it is.

01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:04.596
"The police came
to the lake house.

01:10:04.598 --> 01:10:06.698
Almost lost my flower
but didn't quite work out."

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.834
- Flower? - Flower?
- He said that? He's a boy.

01:10:08.836 --> 01:10:09.902
Hub-uh-uh, hub-uh-uh...

01:10:09.904 --> 01:10:11.571
"Heading
to the Park West Hotel.

01:10:11.573 --> 01:10:13.072
- We've got the Grand Lux Suite."
- Suite?

01:10:13.074 --> 01:10:14.974
"Looks like the little boy
is becoming a man."

01:10:14.976 --> 01:10:16.142
Fucking dork.

01:10:16.144 --> 01:10:17.676
Okay, so that was
ten minutes ago.

01:10:17.678 --> 01:10:18.844
So they haven't had sex yet.

01:10:18.846 --> 01:10:19.978
We can still catch 'em.

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.846
Okay, let's do this.

01:11:06.694 --> 01:11:07.926
Hey.

01:11:07.928 --> 01:11:09.228
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:11.263
How's she doing?
Is she okay?

01:11:11.265 --> 01:11:13.099
No, she's not doing okay.
She's bummed.

01:11:13.101 --> 01:11:15.637
She doesn't even want to kiss.
And I love kissing.

01:11:17.305 --> 01:11:18.871
Give me your room key.

01:11:18.873 --> 01:11:20.272
- What? Why?
- Yeah.

01:11:20.274 --> 01:11:22.308
Give me your room key,
and then bring her up

01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:23.912
in like 15 minutes.

01:11:25.046 --> 01:11:26.645
- Okay.
- Yes.

01:11:26.647 --> 01:11:27.813
Thanks. You're the man.

01:11:27.815 --> 01:11:29.415
Thank you for this.

01:11:35.789 --> 01:11:37.255
How we supposed to find them
in this place?

01:11:37.257 --> 01:11:38.957
It's got like 20 rooms.

01:11:38.959 --> 01:11:40.358
I'm sorry, what the fuck

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.926
are you talking about?

01:11:41.928 --> 01:11:43.929
20? It's got like 200.

01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:45.197
What? 20?

01:11:45.199 --> 01:11:47.233
Grand Lux Suite
is on the top floor.

01:11:47.235 --> 01:11:48.667
Go, go, go, go.

01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:50.301
Move. Hurry, Lisa!

01:12:52.365 --> 01:12:54.368
What am I doing here?

01:13:13.221 --> 01:13:14.953
Oh, my God.

01:13:14.955 --> 01:13:17.089
Oh, my God, my favorite.

01:13:17.091 --> 01:13:18.890
That's so sweet.

01:13:18.892 --> 01:13:20.291
Oh, my God.

01:13:20.293 --> 01:13:21.893
This is a dream.

01:13:21.895 --> 01:13:23.194
It's, like, perfect.

01:13:23.196 --> 01:13:24.764
That is... It's so nice.

01:13:24.766 --> 01:13:25.898
You're so sweet.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.899
It actually wasn't me.

01:13:27.901 --> 01:13:29.100
It was Kayla.

01:13:29.102 --> 01:13:30.835
She wanted you
to have the perfect night.

01:13:30.837 --> 01:13:32.071
That's why it looks so good.

01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:34.807
Well, why do you look so good?

01:13:34.809 --> 01:13:36.541
You're such a dork.

01:13:36.543 --> 01:13:38.245
I-I know.

01:13:40.547 --> 01:13:42.751
Oh, my God.

01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:49.091
Not as smooth as I could.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.527
Let me get my shoes.

01:13:58.833 --> 01:13:59.868
Kayla?

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.807
Nobody move. Where's Kayla?

01:14:07.809 --> 01:14:09.845
Kayla? Kayla?

01:14:10.977 --> 01:14:12.478
Get that out of here.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.013
Now, how's this work?
Is this...?

01:14:14.015 --> 01:14:15.214
- No, just leave it.
- Okay, cool.

01:14:15.216 --> 01:14:16.256
- It's difficult.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:19.419 --> 01:14:21.187
Play sports.

01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:23.154
Mwah. Mwah.

01:14:23.156 --> 01:14:25.957
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

01:14:25.959 --> 01:14:27.326
Mwah.

01:14:27.328 --> 01:14:28.993
And that's that.

01:14:28.995 --> 01:14:32.163
So, you, uh,
sure you want to do this?

01:14:32.165 --> 01:14:33.198
Yeah.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.966
Yes. Fuck yeah.

01:14:34.968 --> 01:14:36.969
You're gonna...
you're gonna penis me.

01:14:36.971 --> 01:14:39.304
- Yep.
- First, I'm gonna...

01:14:39.306 --> 01:14:41.105
I'm just gonna touch it.

01:14:41.107 --> 01:14:42.608
- You want to touch it? Yeah, you can touch it.
- Yeah.

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:44.475
- Yeah, yeah, go for it. Yeah.
- Okay, just, like...

01:14:44.477 --> 01:14:46.478
Oh! Wow!

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.447
Okay. That is, like,
the greatest feeling

01:14:48.449 --> 01:14:50.849
I've ever had
in my entire life.

01:14:50.851 --> 01:14:52.917
Really?

01:14:52.919 --> 01:14:55.987
It doesn't just feel like
a super dry hand of a friend?

01:14:55.989 --> 01:14:57.992
No. Nope.

01:14:59.092 --> 01:15:00.992
Okay, so...

01:15:00.994 --> 01:15:04.129
do you want to, um...

01:15:04.131 --> 01:15:05.432
put it in?

01:15:08.869 --> 01:15:10.035
No.

01:15:10.037 --> 01:15:11.402
Okay.

01:15:11.404 --> 01:15:13.104
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- You know what?

01:15:13.106 --> 01:15:15.640
Look, we don't ha...

01:15:15.642 --> 01:15:17.376
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:15:17.378 --> 01:15:19.277
- Holy shit!
- Right there. Look at all of it.

01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:21.145
Oh, my gosh! I gotta get over.

01:15:21.147 --> 01:15:23.249
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:23.251 --> 01:15:25.117
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:25.119 --> 01:15:27.652
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I just...

01:15:27.654 --> 01:15:29.889
- It's okay.
- I was thinking about it and you,

01:15:29.891 --> 01:15:31.924
and then it just... I'm sorry.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.227
My God.

01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:36.895
You're amazing.

01:15:36.897 --> 01:15:38.930
I know we're still virgins,

01:15:38.932 --> 01:15:41.466
but I feel different, you know?

01:15:41.468 --> 01:15:44.002
Yeah.

01:15:44.004 --> 01:15:45.440
I know.

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:51.076
You ready to, uh, do this?

01:15:51.078 --> 01:15:53.178
Wait.

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.048
Wait. Um...

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.384
Ah, shit.

01:15:58.386 --> 01:16:00.055
Shit.

01:16:02.022 --> 01:16:04.255
Maybe Julie was right.

01:16:04.257 --> 01:16:06.959
Like, maybe losing
your virginity

01:16:06.961 --> 01:16:09.193
doesn't have to be perfect,
but...

01:16:09.195 --> 01:16:10.996
I feel like it should
just be, like,

01:16:10.998 --> 01:16:13.165
a little bit more special
than this, you know?

01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:14.700
- Yeah.
- Like, not cheesy, but...

01:16:14.702 --> 01:16:17.202
Like, if I was hard-pressed
right now,

01:16:17.204 --> 01:16:20.038
I don't think I could remember
your last name.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.040
- It's Aldrich.
- Aldrich.

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:23.108
I thought it was Ostrich.

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:25.376
I-I didn't realize
that you're a virgin.

01:16:25.378 --> 01:16:27.545
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:16:27.547 --> 01:16:31.383
Um, but, like,
I'd still be down to do it,

01:16:31.385 --> 01:16:33.184
but maybe, like, you know,

01:16:33.186 --> 01:16:35.254
when we get to know each other
a little more.

01:16:35.256 --> 01:16:37.055
Like, maybe Monday
or something?

01:16:37.057 --> 01:16:39.491
- Yeah.
- Not to, like, plan it and be weird, but, like...

01:16:39.493 --> 01:16:41.292
No, no, I can look
at my schedule

01:16:41.294 --> 01:16:42.961
- and see if it's...
- Okay.

01:16:42.963 --> 01:16:44.395
Pencil it in.

01:16:44.397 --> 01:16:46.398
Um, yeah, that's cool.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.200
- Okay, cool.
- Um, let's just relax.

01:16:48.202 --> 01:16:50.335
We could do, like, some
light journaling or something.

01:16:50.337 --> 01:16:53.339
Yeah, yeah, we could...
we could do that.

01:16:53.341 --> 01:16:58.309
Or we could do,
like, other stuff.

01:16:58.311 --> 01:17:00.312
Yeah? Like what?

01:17:00.314 --> 01:17:02.480
Like...

01:17:02.482 --> 01:17:05.617
not sex, but...

01:17:05.619 --> 01:17:09.388
I'm still down for pleasure.

01:17:16.329 --> 01:17:18.330
You got this.

01:17:18.332 --> 01:17:19.398
Hey, guys. What's up?

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.203
Anyone seen Sam?
Anyone seen Sam?

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.340
Chad!

01:17:29.342 --> 01:17:30.341
Fuck.

01:17:30.343 --> 01:17:31.980
Get out of the way.

01:17:34.248 --> 01:17:35.747
Jesus!

01:17:38.284 --> 01:17:39.718
What the f...?

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.185
You again?

01:17:41.187 --> 01:17:42.520
- You!
- What the fuck?

01:17:42.522 --> 01:17:44.156
What's your beef with me, dude?

01:17:44.158 --> 01:17:45.390
I don't know
who the fuck you are!

01:17:45.392 --> 01:17:47.393
I'm Jake motherfucking Donahue.

01:17:47.395 --> 01:17:49.394
That name means nothing to me.

01:17:49.396 --> 01:17:51.362
Do you know what it's like
to be humiliated

01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:52.730
in front of everyone you know

01:17:52.732 --> 01:17:54.636
and have to seek redemption
for that?

01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:58.103
Actually, yes, I do.

01:17:58.105 --> 01:18:01.240
Kayla? Kayla?

01:18:01.242 --> 01:18:02.741
Kayla? Get the hell away

01:18:02.743 --> 01:18:05.143
from my daughter,
you little piece of shit!

01:18:05.145 --> 01:18:06.812
Dad, what the...?

01:18:06.814 --> 01:18:08.380
Oh, my God!

01:18:08.382 --> 01:18:10.148
You okay?
He didn't hurt you, did he?

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:11.617
What? No, he didn't hurt me.

01:18:11.619 --> 01:18:13.652
Holy shit! Connor.

01:18:13.654 --> 01:18:15.386
- Ow.
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:18:15.388 --> 01:18:17.089
I'm actually totally fine.

01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:18.490
Connor, I'm so sorry.

01:18:18.492 --> 01:18:19.524
- Are you okay, though?
- Yeah, please...

01:18:19.526 --> 01:18:20.725
Are you sure?

01:18:20.727 --> 01:18:22.827
Dad, what the...
what are you doing here?

01:18:22.829 --> 01:18:24.595
I've been following you around
all night.

01:18:24.597 --> 01:18:26.365
Are you ser...? Oh, my God.

01:18:26.367 --> 01:18:27.733
You've been following me?

01:18:27.735 --> 01:18:29.434
- Are you crazy?
- You gave me no choice.

01:18:29.436 --> 01:18:30.702
You're in over your head
with this kid.

01:18:30.704 --> 01:18:32.170
I am not some pathetic

01:18:32.172 --> 01:18:33.538
damsel in distress
that needs saving.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.107
- I can handle myself.
- No, you can't.

01:18:35.109 --> 01:18:36.541
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

01:18:36.543 --> 01:18:39.077
- Yes, I can.
- Kayla, you can't.

01:18:39.079 --> 01:18:41.080
And that's why I'm here.

01:18:41.082 --> 01:18:42.249
It's my job.

01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:45.451
Oh.

01:18:45.453 --> 01:18:47.752
Yeah, so you just don't think

01:18:47.754 --> 01:18:51.423
I can make my own decisions
and handle myself.

01:18:51.425 --> 01:18:53.660
That really fucking sucks.

01:18:57.163 --> 01:18:59.764
Kayla...

01:18:59.766 --> 01:19:02.701
Kayla, I'm just trying
to figure this thing out.

01:19:02.703 --> 01:19:06.040
God. Why is sex even bad?

01:19:10.511 --> 01:19:12.678
I-I don't know.
I don't know. It's...

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.612
It's not... You know, it's...

01:19:14.614 --> 01:19:16.550
I don't know.

01:19:17.717 --> 01:19:19.550
I'm...

01:19:19.552 --> 01:19:22.688
I'm just trying to be
the best dad I can be.

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:25.256
Well, you are.

01:19:25.258 --> 01:19:28.292
You taught me everything.

01:19:28.294 --> 01:19:30.595
You built me up.

01:19:30.597 --> 01:19:32.663
Made me strong.

01:19:32.665 --> 01:19:35.367
You made me into who I am.

01:19:35.369 --> 01:19:37.768
Like, that's...

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:41.540
You did not have
to save me tonight, Dad.

01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:45.680
You taught me how to do that
a long time ago.

01:19:46.779 --> 01:19:48.215
And I love you for it.

01:19:50.618 --> 01:19:52.687
Best coach ever.

01:19:57.557 --> 01:20:00.259
Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:00.261 --> 01:20:03.228
Oh, Dad, come on.

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:04.766
Come on, toughen up.

01:20:06.467 --> 01:20:08.367
It was just really nice
what you said.

01:20:08.369 --> 01:20:10.301
It's good. It's good.

01:20:10.303 --> 01:20:11.670
I mean it.

01:20:11.672 --> 01:20:13.839
Thanks. I feel like...

01:20:13.841 --> 01:20:17.643
like Phil Jackson when he
was coaching the Bulls,

01:20:17.645 --> 01:20:21.479
and... and then the...
and they were so good.

01:20:22.917 --> 01:20:25.216
- That's how I feel right now.
- Yeah.

01:20:25.218 --> 01:20:28.187
I should have taken
my socks off first.

01:20:29.923 --> 01:20:32.957
Now, I'm just warning you,
I've practiced a few times,

01:20:32.959 --> 01:20:35.460
- but this might not go that well.
- That doesn't look right.

01:20:35.462 --> 01:20:36.929
- Yeah, all right.
- I think you need another one.

01:20:36.931 --> 01:20:39.264
- I think we need another one, too.
- Wait, wait.

01:20:39.266 --> 01:20:40.831
We have to do our dance.

01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:42.667
- We have to. Like, yeah, yeah.
- What, now?

01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:44.736
- Naked?
- No, get me one of those, um...

01:20:44.738 --> 01:20:46.505
the hotel robes.
I want to feel fabulous.

01:20:46.507 --> 01:20:48.240
Okay.

01:20:48.242 --> 01:20:49.577
Coming right up, milady.

01:21:05.258 --> 01:21:08.327
We're gonna christen
every corner of this room.

01:21:08.329 --> 01:21:11.362
And when we're done,
let's FaceTime my parents.

01:21:11.364 --> 01:21:12.764
Okay, but right now,

01:21:12.766 --> 01:21:14.933
I want you to stare
into my eyes.

01:21:14.935 --> 01:21:16.535
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:16.537 --> 01:21:18.970
I just want, like,
a real connection.

01:21:18.972 --> 01:21:21.907
So you just want me
to look straight into your eyes

01:21:21.909 --> 01:21:23.709
for the next three minutes
and 37 seconds?

01:21:23.711 --> 01:21:24.809
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.819
Look at me.

01:22:50.931 --> 01:22:52.563
- Dad?
- Where is he?

01:22:52.565 --> 01:22:54.765
- What are you doing here?
- Chad?

01:22:54.767 --> 01:22:56.568
Hey, Chad, you motherfucker.

01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:58.804
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

01:22:58.806 --> 01:23:00.471
Did he make you do something
you don't want to do?

01:23:00.473 --> 01:23:01.706
'Cause I don't care if he's

01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:02.941
the fucking coolest kid
in school.

01:23:02.943 --> 01:23:04.376
I'm gonna shove his fedora

01:23:04.378 --> 01:23:06.877
so far up his ass,
it'll be a hat.

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:09.747
No, Dad, we didn't do it.

01:23:09.749 --> 01:23:11.116
All right? And even if we did,

01:23:11.118 --> 01:23:14.022
it would be <i>none</i>
of your business.

01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:20.692
It's just,
I was worried about you.

01:23:20.694 --> 01:23:21.928
Well, that's a first.

01:23:23.396 --> 01:23:25.730
I deserve that.

01:23:25.732 --> 01:23:26.997
Sam, I gotta tell you
something,

01:23:26.999 --> 01:23:28.935
and I'm just gonna say it.

01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:42.684
Sam, I have realized
over the last few years...

01:23:44.418 --> 01:23:46.518
...that I have made
a big mistake in my life.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.656
What, like cheating on my mom?

01:23:49.823 --> 01:23:51.723
Well, no. Marrying your mom.

01:23:51.725 --> 01:23:53.125
But no, that...
that wasn't a mistake,

01:23:53.127 --> 01:23:55.426
because then I wouldn't
have had you.

01:23:57.163 --> 01:24:02.733
I've made lots of mistakes,
but th-the big mistake...

01:24:02.735 --> 01:24:08.506
is that I let what happened
between your mom and I

01:24:08.508 --> 01:24:11.511
get in the way
of our relationship.

01:24:15.114 --> 01:24:16.650
I'm sorry.

01:24:18.185 --> 01:24:22.787
And I hope that we
can start over and...

01:24:22.789 --> 01:24:26.491
build up our relationship again
because...

01:24:26.493 --> 01:24:28.096
you're my only kid.

01:24:29.863 --> 01:24:31.462
And I'm your only dad.

01:24:31.464 --> 01:24:32.730
Well, Frank is...

01:24:32.732 --> 01:24:33.999
Fuck Frank.

01:24:37.770 --> 01:24:39.703
Frank's fine.

01:24:39.705 --> 01:24:43.675
Dad, can I tell you
something now?

01:24:43.677 --> 01:24:44.742
Yes.

01:24:44.744 --> 01:24:46.111
Yes, yes, yes, anything.

01:24:46.113 --> 01:24:48.082
I'm a lesbian.

01:24:54.555 --> 01:24:56.089
Give me your hand.

01:24:58.225 --> 01:24:59.758
What does your mom think?

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.828
She doesn't know.

01:25:05.665 --> 01:25:07.732
You told me
before you told your mom?

01:25:07.734 --> 01:25:10.100
- Yeah.
- That's big news.

01:25:10.102 --> 01:25:12.470
She doesn't know?

01:25:12.472 --> 01:25:14.538
- You didn't tell Frank?
- No.

01:25:25.819 --> 01:25:27.885
Okay. Over.

01:25:27.887 --> 01:25:29.955
Crying is over.

01:25:29.957 --> 01:25:31.156
What do your girlfriends think?

01:25:31.158 --> 01:25:32.991
No, I'm too nervous.
I can't tell them.

01:25:32.993 --> 01:25:35.059
You're nervous
to tell Kayla and Julie?

01:25:35.061 --> 01:25:38.630
It's just... I don't want
to lose my two best friends.

01:25:38.632 --> 01:25:40.799
This is the stuff you tell
the people you care about.

01:25:40.801 --> 01:25:43.702
You think they're not gonna
support you because you're gay?

01:25:43.704 --> 01:25:46.938
They would support you
if you were a vampire.

01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.974
They would support you more.

01:25:48.976 --> 01:25:51.242
With all the <i>Twilight</i> shit.

01:25:51.244 --> 01:25:53.911
- Do we still like <i>Twilight?</i>
- Definitely not.

01:25:53.913 --> 01:25:55.980
No, no.

01:25:55.982 --> 01:25:57.685
Oh, God.

01:25:58.952 --> 01:26:00.986
Thanks for showing up.

01:26:00.988 --> 01:26:02.086
Really.

01:26:02.088 --> 01:26:05.023
But you should probably leave

01:26:05.025 --> 01:26:07.826
because it's insane
that you even came here

01:26:07.828 --> 01:26:10.094
in the first place.

01:26:10.096 --> 01:26:12.029
I'd love to get
a picture with you.

01:26:12.031 --> 01:26:13.697
Yeah.

01:26:13.699 --> 01:26:15.733
Great. Okay.

01:26:15.735 --> 01:26:17.301
Just gonna stand on this.

01:26:17.303 --> 01:26:19.737
Yeah, you know...
you know the drill. Come on.

01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:21.238
Come on. Here we go.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.477
Gotta turn it around here.

01:26:26.747 --> 01:26:28.580
Dad, you're not taking it.

01:26:28.582 --> 01:26:29.851
It's...

01:26:31.717 --> 01:26:34.184
What?

01:26:34.186 --> 01:26:36.821
I'll remember this.

01:26:36.823 --> 01:26:38.188
Come on.

01:26:38.190 --> 01:26:39.957
Oh, my God.

01:26:39.959 --> 01:26:41.693
What's up, dawg?

01:26:41.695 --> 01:26:44.062
So, I just, uh...

01:26:44.064 --> 01:26:46.598
parented the shit out of Sam.

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:48.265
And I feel, uh...

01:26:48.267 --> 01:26:50.335
oh, God, like, uh...

01:26:50.337 --> 01:26:52.237
pride, I think.

01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:53.737
- That's it.
- It's new.

01:26:53.739 --> 01:26:55.072
Good for you, man.

01:26:55.074 --> 01:26:56.206
Thanks.

01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:57.274
Well done, my friend.

01:26:57.276 --> 01:26:58.710
- Thank you.
- Well done.

01:26:58.712 --> 01:27:00.178
How'd it go with Kayla?

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.880
Put Connor through a wall.

01:27:01.882 --> 01:27:03.648
Are you serious?

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:05.584
Yeah. He's okay.

01:27:05.586 --> 01:27:07.018
Yeah, he's lighter
than I thought.

01:27:08.187 --> 01:27:09.821
Hey.

01:27:09.823 --> 01:27:10.988
Hi.

01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:13.625
So, Julie's, um...

01:27:13.627 --> 01:27:15.093
Julie's having sex right now.

01:27:15.095 --> 01:27:17.629
- Okay. And sit down.
- Wowie.

01:27:17.631 --> 01:27:18.996
Yeah.

01:27:18.998 --> 01:27:20.898
But it's good.
It's fine, right?

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.800
I mean, you have to do that
eventually.

01:27:22.802 --> 01:27:23.969
Right?

01:27:23.971 --> 01:27:25.636
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

01:27:25.638 --> 01:27:28.173
They seem like they really like
each other, and that's nice.

01:27:28.175 --> 01:27:31.776
That's a good thing, but it's
just a little, you know, scary,

01:27:31.778 --> 01:27:34.679
because what if he doesn't know
how to do it right?

01:27:34.681 --> 01:27:37.182
You know, like, what if he
doesn't know where to put it?

01:27:37.184 --> 01:27:38.983
But he knows, right?
Should I go back up there?

01:27:38.985 --> 01:27:40.885
- No. No, no, no, no.
- No, no, he'll figure it out.

01:27:40.887 --> 01:27:42.053
- No, no.
- It's one or the other.

01:27:42.055 --> 01:27:44.089
Nope. You stay right here.

01:27:44.091 --> 01:27:46.627
Do you want to have
a drink right now?

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.693
You mean, like, hang out?

01:27:49.695 --> 01:27:50.694
Yeah.

01:27:50.696 --> 01:27:53.063
Yes, I do.

01:27:53.065 --> 01:27:54.933
I'm in. I'm definitely in.

01:27:54.935 --> 01:27:57.801
Um, we will be having
some shots of alcohol, please.

01:27:57.803 --> 01:27:58.902
Yes, we will.

01:27:58.904 --> 01:27:59.938
This is crazy.

01:28:01.341 --> 01:28:02.974
- This is...
- Well, I'm going to, uh...

01:28:02.976 --> 01:28:06.844
let you guys have your fun,
and I will, uh...

01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:08.982
I-I will see you guys around.

01:28:13.919 --> 01:28:15.655
Hey!

01:28:17.056 --> 01:28:18.693
You, too.

01:28:20.159 --> 01:28:21.893
Yeah.

01:28:21.895 --> 01:28:23.394
Right.

01:28:23.396 --> 01:28:25.196
Fuck yeah.

01:28:25.198 --> 01:28:27.165
Piña colada.

01:28:27.167 --> 01:28:28.736
Just get him a shot.

01:28:29.802 --> 01:28:31.335
Cheers.

01:28:31.337 --> 01:28:32.770
What a night, guys.

01:28:32.772 --> 01:28:34.240
That's beautiful.

01:28:36.943 --> 01:28:40.010
So, I don't think the kid
at the lake house

01:28:40.012 --> 01:28:41.712
was actually butt-chugging.

01:28:41.714 --> 01:28:42.947
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

01:28:42.949 --> 01:28:44.282
- What?
- Yep. - Yeah.

01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:46.917
And so he threw me
through a table, uh...

01:28:46.919 --> 01:28:48.219
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it was cool.

01:28:48.221 --> 01:28:50.220
I, like... I kind of feel fine.

01:28:50.222 --> 01:28:52.157
- All right, see you.
- It's cool. - See you.

01:28:52.159 --> 01:28:53.358
Hey, guys.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.725
Austin, uh, let's go

01:28:54.727 --> 01:28:55.859
- get a drink, man.
- Yeah, sure.

01:28:55.861 --> 01:28:57.062
Want a fry?

01:28:57.064 --> 01:28:59.066
So badly.

01:29:00.734 --> 01:29:02.434
Can I have a fry, too?

01:29:02.436 --> 01:29:04.335
- Yeah.
- Yes.

01:29:05.372 --> 01:29:06.837
So...

01:29:06.839 --> 01:29:09.340
I... I couldn't
go through with it.

01:29:09.342 --> 01:29:12.346
Yes, I didn't. No.

01:29:16.248 --> 01:29:17.749
Holy shit.

01:29:17.751 --> 01:29:19.283
You're a woman amongst girls.

01:29:19.285 --> 01:29:21.018
- Julie. - Yeah.
- Congratu-fuck-ulations.

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.321
- Thank you. Thank you.
- How was it?

01:29:23.323 --> 01:29:24.788
Honestly,
it was a little painful,

01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:27.058
kind of fast
and kind of awkward,

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:28.492
but absolutely perfect.

01:29:28.494 --> 01:29:29.960
Aw!

01:29:30.963 --> 01:29:32.730
You guys, so much...

01:29:32.732 --> 01:29:34.331
so much went down tonight.

01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:35.332
I know.

01:29:35.334 --> 01:29:37.434
Including Connor.

01:29:37.436 --> 01:29:39.437
- No.
- Let's just say...

01:29:39.439 --> 01:29:41.773
The Chef went out to eat...

01:29:41.775 --> 01:29:43.241
my pussy.

01:29:44.477 --> 01:29:45.910
It was good.

01:29:45.912 --> 01:29:47.344
Ba-ba-ba!

01:29:47.346 --> 01:29:49.346
- DJ Chad.
- Is that Chad?

01:29:49.348 --> 01:29:52.050
- That's Chad. Chad!
- That's Chad.

01:29:52.052 --> 01:29:53.785
Yes, Chad!

01:29:53.787 --> 01:29:55.786
Holy shit. Fuck yeah, Chad!

01:30:10.102 --> 01:30:12.303
Guys, I got to tell you
something.

01:30:12.305 --> 01:30:14.171
Okay, okay.

01:30:17.177 --> 01:30:18.542
Really?

01:30:18.544 --> 01:30:19.877
- Yeah.
- Wait, you are?

01:30:19.879 --> 01:30:21.545
Yeah.

01:30:21.547 --> 01:30:23.180
I love you.

01:30:23.182 --> 01:30:24.816
Forever.

01:30:24.818 --> 01:30:26.416
And you, too.

01:30:26.418 --> 01:30:28.419
Oh, my God!

01:30:28.421 --> 01:30:30.287
- I love you. Hold on.
- Sam, come here, you.

01:30:30.289 --> 01:30:31.822
Excuse me.

01:30:31.824 --> 01:30:33.291
I can't believe
you didn't tell us.

01:30:33.293 --> 01:30:34.526
Yay!

01:30:38.431 --> 01:30:39.863
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

01:30:39.865 --> 01:30:41.265
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:30:41.267 --> 01:30:43.167
Oh.

01:30:43.169 --> 01:30:46.039
Uh, Julie, I think we got
something over here.

01:30:47.841 --> 01:30:49.243
Dope cape.

01:30:52.345 --> 01:30:54.344
And I'm not...

01:30:54.346 --> 01:30:55.982
misreading things.

01:31:20.873 --> 01:31:23.273
So you'll call me every day
till you get to L.A., right?

01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:24.876
Yeah, and then, like,
every day after that.

01:31:24.878 --> 01:31:26.010
Okay.

01:31:26.012 --> 01:31:27.245
I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:31:27.247 --> 01:31:29.147
You're gonna be okay, though.

01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:30.480
Are you gonna be okay?

01:31:30.482 --> 01:31:31.916
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:31:31.918 --> 01:31:34.051
It's the weirdest thing
because...

01:31:34.053 --> 01:31:39.023
I have been worried
about this day for 18 years,

01:31:39.025 --> 01:31:42.492
and then I wake up
this morning, and...

01:31:42.494 --> 01:31:44.429
nothing.

01:31:44.431 --> 01:31:46.197
Like, I don't feel
emotional at all.

01:31:46.199 --> 01:31:48.398
I just feel, like...

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.335
- It's so bizarre.
- Mm-hmm.

01:31:50.337 --> 01:31:51.935
What is that?

01:31:51.937 --> 01:31:53.203
It's, like, splashing on me.

01:31:53.205 --> 01:31:55.005
I know.
Isn't that so strange?

01:31:55.007 --> 01:31:56.142
Yeah.

01:31:58.244 --> 01:31:59.579
I love you, Mom.

01:32:00.881 --> 01:32:02.182
I love you.

01:32:04.316 --> 01:32:05.649
No, I have money. I...

01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:07.417
Lisa, tell him
I can afford br...

01:32:07.419 --> 01:32:10.188
Hmm. Sorry. Sorry.

01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:12.223
All right, come on.

01:32:12.225 --> 01:32:14.091
Let's get this road trip
started!

01:32:14.093 --> 01:32:15.526
- We're waiting for you!
- I love you.

01:32:15.528 --> 01:32:17.629
- Bye.
- Okay.

01:32:17.631 --> 01:32:19.834
Oh, hold on.
Let me take a video.

01:32:30.276 --> 01:32:32.510
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:32:32.512 --> 01:32:34.211
Bye, Mom.

01:32:34.213 --> 01:32:35.612
- I love you.
- Okay, bye.

01:32:35.614 --> 01:32:37.180
- Mwah!
- See you.

01:32:37.182 --> 01:32:39.082
Drop Julie off in Cali,
and then you and Kayla

01:32:39.084 --> 01:32:40.451
- come right back home.
- That's a, a big maybe.

01:32:40.453 --> 01:32:42.019
- And text, please. Please.
- Hey.

01:32:42.021 --> 01:32:43.487
Take care of my mom,
you two, okay?

01:32:43.489 --> 01:32:45.223
- We will. All right.
- Later, big guy.

01:32:45.225 --> 01:32:47.125
- Bye, Dad.
- I'm going to college! - Bye!

01:32:47.127 --> 01:32:48.660
Drive careful, young
man. That's precious cargo.

01:32:48.662 --> 01:32:50.422
Love you!

01:32:51.498 --> 01:32:53.230
- Aw.
- Come on.

01:32:53.232 --> 01:32:54.598
- Guys. - Come on.
- We did it.

01:32:54.601 --> 01:32:56.934
We did it. We did it.

01:32:56.936 --> 01:32:58.135
We parented.

01:32:58.137 --> 01:32:59.970
- We did it.
- We did it.

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:04.709
Oh, it's Julie.

01:33:04.711 --> 01:33:07.210
Oh, I must have been
accidentally added to the...

01:33:07.212 --> 01:33:08.947
the group conversation.

01:33:08.949 --> 01:33:10.715
- Oh, well, should probably leave.
- What's, uh...

01:33:10.717 --> 01:33:12.483
"Can't-can't believe
we're on our own now."

01:33:12.485 --> 01:33:13.651
Aw, that's sweet.
- Yeah.

01:33:13.653 --> 01:33:15.486
"We're gonna get lit af."

01:33:15.488 --> 01:33:17.188
"Lit A.F."

01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:19.157
That's not great.

01:33:19.159 --> 01:33:20.992
No, it's... they're gonna get
literature. African literature.

01:33:20.994 --> 01:33:22.626
You think that's
what "lit A.F." means?

01:33:22.628 --> 01:33:24.394
You think they're talking
to each other about, like...

01:33:24.396 --> 01:33:26.130
- "Lit A.F."
- "Can The Chef get us..."

01:33:26.132 --> 01:33:27.331
Trees? What the hell's trees?

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:29.067
Trees mean weed.
I told you that.

01:33:29.069 --> 01:33:30.702
- Mushrooms, pills.
- No, the pills are...

01:33:30.704 --> 01:33:32.069
Kayla's allergy.
That's Claritin.

01:33:32.071 --> 01:33:33.136
It's not Claritin. Look.

01:33:33.138 --> 01:33:34.304
Snowflakes. That's blow.

01:33:34.306 --> 01:33:36.040
"#NoParentsNoRules.

01:33:36.042 --> 01:33:39.577
# MadDrugs.
# NoCondoms."

01:33:39.579 --> 01:33:41.278
Why would they hashtag that?

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.380
Wait, I'm sorry. Is that
a needle and an eggplant?

01:33:43.382 --> 01:33:46.684
What, are they gonna inject
heroin into some guy's dick?

01:33:46.686 --> 01:33:48.018
- Let's go.
- Let's get in the car.

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:49.153
- I'll drive.
- I'm sitting behind you.

01:33:49.155 --> 01:33:51.188
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:52.290
We're just messing with you.

01:33:52.292 --> 01:33:53.292
Ha-ha!

01:33:54.593 --> 01:33:56.594
"We love you guys.
Don't worry."

01:33:58.097 --> 01:34:01.165
You guys were so pranked!
I was in on it.

01:34:01.167 --> 01:34:03.033
- You didn't know.
- No, no, I did. I didn't know it was

01:34:03.035 --> 01:34:04.568
coming right now. That's why
I kind of sold it so well.

01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:05.769
But it doesn't matter.

01:34:05.771 --> 01:34:08.305
But you guys were like,
"Holy shit!"

01:34:08.307 --> 01:34:09.639
- Yeah.
- Whew.

01:34:27.459 --> 01:34:29.227
Damn it, Mitchell.

01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:30.631
Marco.

01:34:32.031 --> 01:34:33.096
Polo.

01:34:33.098 --> 01:34:34.732
I...

01:34:34.734 --> 01:34:36.669
Mitchell,
are you getting a snack?

01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:40.470
I'm so glad we can
do stuff like this

01:34:40.472 --> 01:34:41.738
now that Kayla's in college.

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.274
I have no idea where you are.

01:34:44.276 --> 01:34:46.676
I'm gonna do so much stuff
to you when I find you.

01:34:46.678 --> 01:34:48.612
- Oh, oh.
- Marco.

01:34:48.614 --> 01:34:50.081
- Polo.
- Ah, ah.

01:34:50.083 --> 01:34:51.349
Polo!

01:34:51.351 --> 01:34:52.716
I can't believe you!
It took forever!

01:34:52.718 --> 01:34:54.618
I spent so much time
on the stairs.

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:56.319
- We're doing this.
- We're, like, totally doing it.

01:34:56.321 --> 01:34:57.822
- I know. It's hot.
- Let's just get crazy.

01:34:57.824 --> 01:34:58.822
I don't know.

01:34:58.824 --> 01:35:00.358
I want you to grab my balls,

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.093
like Ron likes it,
like, uh... like, hard.
