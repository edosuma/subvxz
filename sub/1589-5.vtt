00:01.100 --> 00:01.998
Previously on
Pretty Little Liars

00:03.100 --> 00:04.590
We've wanted this for so long--

00:04.630 --> 00:07.098
a life without "A,"
and Ali back.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.493
People are preparing
for Ali's return

00:08.540 --> 00:10.701
and it's not with flowers
and Welcome Home banners.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.129
I'm going back to school.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.637
And if we just stick together,
everything is going to be fine.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.204
There was still
a gIrl In that grave.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.218
Someone killed her.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.445
And Jessica was going
to say that it was you.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.710
I'm really worried
that my dad tried to stop her.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.150
You think that your dad--
Yeah.

00:26.190 --> 00:26.986
And so does my mom.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.715
I mean,
she practically admitted it.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.081
I can't stop thinking about
Shana's family.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.529
Every time I close my eyes,

00:32.560 --> 00:34.221
_ all I can see
IS her grandmother.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.728
You're just going to have to
find a way to forgive yourself.

00:44.770 --> 00:47.170
Can't tell if this is Mars
or a satellite.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.370
Do you have
the coordinates?

00:48.410 --> 00:50.344
It says we're supposed
to be dressed

00:50.380 --> 00:52.541
appropriately
for the presentation.

00:52.580 --> 00:56.744
Like, business conservative?
I'd rather wear vomit.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.258
Okay, but we have
to find the planet

00:59.290 --> 01:01.178
so that we can study it.

01:07.530 --> 01:08.656
Hanna?

01:11.170 --> 01:12.398
Look, there's no rule
that says

01:12.440 --> 01:14.169
you have to walk into school
with her tomorrow.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.236
Well, it's not written down
but it's understood.

01:17.470 --> 01:19.233
We're gonna walk down
those hallways with Ali

01:19.280 --> 01:20.872
and everyone will think
what they've always thought.

01:20.910 --> 01:23.174
Which is what?

01:23.210 --> 01:25.269
That we're her puppets.
But you're not.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.440
So who cares
what they think?

01:27.480 --> 01:28.742
Hey.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.418
People know
who you are, Hanna.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.418
They do?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.813
'Cause lately I don't.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.198
EZRA: Are you still having
nightmares about Shana?

01:40.230 --> 01:43.165
I see her everywhere.
Everywhere.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.191
It's like she's haunting me
for what I did to her.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.390
Look, all right, all right.

01:47.670 --> 01:48.830
This isn't about Shana.

01:48.870 --> 01:51.532
This is you doing this
to yourself.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.128
Okay?

01:54.580 --> 01:56.377
I wish I could
fix this for you.

02:04.650 --> 02:06.880
And I know it's silly but--

02:06.920 --> 02:09.923
I keep waiting for that
"A" message.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.723
You know, that text
that's gonna come in

02:11.760 --> 02:13.398
with a picture of me

02:13.430 --> 02:15.398
standing over
Shana's dead body.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.364
That picture
doesn't exist.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.437
You don't have to live in fear
of your cell phone anymore.

02:20.470 --> 02:21.698
No?
Tell that to my right eye.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.537
It still twitches
every time I get a text.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.276
What's she doing
out this late?
I don't know.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.175
Since she's been back
she's practically
lived in her bedroom.

02:36.720 --> 02:37.812
Alison?

02:43.490 --> 02:45.526
Is this a date?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.491
Ali, what are you doing?
Who was that?

02:49.530 --> 02:52.431
Oh, my dad forgot
my enrollment forms
on his desk.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.290
And he's stuck
at home on a call,

02:54.340 --> 02:56.262
so his flunlq
dropped me off.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.663
I guess school
is the kind of thing

02:57.710 --> 02:58.802
that my mom handled.

03:01.710 --> 03:03.803
I haven't had a chance to say
how sorry I am

03:03.850 --> 03:05.340
about your mom.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.726
* Got a secret

03:22.770 --> 03:23.964
* Can you keep it?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.537
* Swear this one
you'll save *

03:26.570 --> 03:28.891
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:28.940 --> 03:31.636
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:31.670 --> 03:33.604
* If I show you
then I know *

03:33.640 --> 03:36.700
* You won't tell
what I said *

03:36.750 --> 03:38.968
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:39.010 --> 03:41.774
* If one of them is dead

03:46.320 --> 03:47.582
Do you want me
to talk to your dad?

03:49.490 --> 03:50.479
Good luck finding him.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.395
He's avoiding me
like the plague.

03:54.730 --> 03:56.493
Does Alison know?

03:56.530 --> 03:58.361
What you think
he did to her mom?

03:58.400 --> 03:59.992
It's not
the kind of information

04:00.040 --> 04:01.393
that I want to arm her with

04:01.440 --> 04:03.465
until I know
for sure that he did it.

04:03.510 --> 04:07.332
So if action is character,
then who is Alison now?

04:07.380 --> 04:09.348
Been reading Fitzgerald?

04:09.380 --> 04:10.699
I've been
re-reading Fitzgerald.

04:12.650 --> 04:14.470
I already know
Alison's story

04:14.520 --> 04:16.385
but I find it hard
to picture her as a victim.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.388
She seems really genuine
when she says

04:18.420 --> 04:19.853
that what she's been through
changed her.

04:19.890 --> 04:21.016
And I want to believe her.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.084
But you don't.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.954
How can I believe a story
that I haven't been told?

04:25.990 --> 04:27.457
I mean, if the truth
is in the details,

04:27.500 --> 04:29.422
we still don't know
what happened to her.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.688
Spencer, we wouldn't be us

04:31.730 --> 04:33.368
if we didn't believe
In second chances.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.560
But it's okay
to close the door

04:34.600 --> 04:36.033
on someone if they're toxic.

04:36.070 --> 04:37.662
( cell phone ringing )

04:40.380 --> 04:41.677
It's Jenna.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.901
I didn't know
you two were talking again.

04:45.950 --> 04:46.939
We're not.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.016
I haven't talk to her
since she moved to New York.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.415
Hello.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.527
I'll be right there.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.527
What's going on?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.869
Shana is dead.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.527
She could hardly
get out the words,

05:04.570 --> 05:06.561
but Jenna said
she was murdered.

05:07.670 --> 05:08.796
EMILY: I'm sorry, Spence.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.637
Okay, nobody likes
lying to Toby.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.672
But if he finds out
what happened in New York--

05:12.710 --> 05:13.836
Just tell him the truth.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.840
If you're lying to protect me,
you don't need to.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.448
It's your decision, Spencer.
It's not hers.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.554
Alison, you don't have
to stand watch.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.956
Spencer said that Toby
was taking her home.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.582
Jenna's not coming here.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.424
He said
she sounded broken.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.064
She's still full-on blind,
right?

05:38.100 --> 05:39.431
Maybe she came back

05:39.470 --> 05:41.495
'cause she wants to be close
to her famIIy.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.007
Hey, no offense,
but if she's sad

05:43.040 --> 05:44.530
she could cry in New York.

05:44.570 --> 05:45.537
Let's face it,

05:45.570 --> 05:48.107
we blinded Jenna,
we killed her girlfriend.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.744
She's back
to punish us for it.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.442
Said with absolutely no tact
but you're right.

05:54.150 --> 05:56.584
I had no idea that Jenna
was living in New York.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.986
Which means
that Shana was lying

05:59.020 --> 06:01.614
when she said that Jenna didn't
know that she was after us.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.525
She came home to finish
what Shana started.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.051
And I still don't have
time for a hobby.

06:06.090 --> 06:07.648
What?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.463
The new normal
was supposed to be

06:09.500 --> 06:11.821
a carefree senior year.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.690
"A's" dead and we're still
plottIng

06:13.740 --> 06:15.890
our zone defense
in the dark.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.909
You guys have put up with
so much to help me.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.999
And I've made
a lot of enemies.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.999
But it's not going to be us
against them tomorrow.

06:25.050 --> 06:28.042
Just like I'm working
to earn back your trust,

06:28.080 --> 06:29.069
I'm going to try
and make amends

06:32.860 --> 06:34.452
Does that include Jenna?

06:41.830 --> 06:47.564
* I need a wrecking ball,
I want the sky to fall *

06:47.600 --> 06:51.900
* God, I feel
so small tonight *

06:51.940 --> 06:53.498
I've been through
a lot worse.

06:53.540 --> 06:58.773
* Need a wrecking ball,
I could crash and fall *

06:58.810 --> 07:02.940
* Could it break my wall,
Make it right? *

07:04.550 --> 07:06.518
* Can I begin again?

07:06.560 --> 07:07.709
You can do this.

07:10.190 --> 07:11.657
* Can I begin again?

07:16.230 --> 07:17.595
Maybe she's not coming.

07:17.630 --> 07:18.597
Oh, she's coming.

07:18.630 --> 07:19.733
We should
have picked her up.

07:19.770 --> 07:20.737
Why didn't
we pick her up?

07:20.770 --> 07:22.089
Her dad wanted
to drop her off.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.698
Guys, I don't think
she's coming,

07:23.740 --> 07:24.832
I think she's here.

07:26.840 --> 07:30.071
GIRL:You guys
coming this weekend?
BOY: Yeah, I'm planning on it.

07:32.850 --> 07:35.546
GIRL:
Once a bitch, always a bitch.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.810
BOY: Hey, Ali, remember me?

07:37.850 --> 07:39.556
Do they love her
or do they hate her?

07:39.590 --> 07:41.217
I can't tell.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.626
HANNA: Wait, Ali knows
Cindy and Mindy?
Hey, Cindy. Hey, Mindy.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.548
She used to call them
"gayrons."

07:45.590 --> 07:46.557
Gayrons?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.022
Yeah, like gay morons.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.895
So that's the
Queen Of Mean?

07:53.700 --> 07:54.928
I can't watch this.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.665
You're leaving?

07:59.110 --> 08:02.170
* When did
everything fall apart? *

08:02.210 --> 08:05.577
_* When did
the nIghtmare start? *

08:05.610 --> 08:10.240
* Why is it so hard
to find a way *

08:10.290 --> 08:11.245
Ready?

08:11.290 --> 08:13.588
Thanks for waiting for me.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.521
*

08:16.560 --> 08:18.687
* To begin again

08:21.560 --> 08:24.666
* But I need a big roll

08:24.700 --> 08:27.589
* I need a shot of night

08:27.640 --> 08:31.906
* I need to be
shaken up tonight *

08:33.310 --> 08:35.130
* I need a wrecking ball

08:38.680 --> 08:42.013
* 'Cause I'm a wreck

08:42.050 --> 08:44.314
* Yeah

08:44.350 --> 08:47.251
* I need a wrecking ball *

08:47.290 --> 08:49.508
Ali, do you know
where your first class is?

08:51.060 --> 08:52.152
I'm supposed to go

08:52.190 --> 08:54.124
to the guidance
counselor's office.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.765
But I can't remember
where It IS.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.768
I've got chem lab.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.893
It's close.
I can walk with you.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.293
Thanks, Em.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.638
Well, I hope you have
a good first day back.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.807
Yeah.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.307
Call us if you need us.

09:07.340 --> 09:08.898
We'll meet up
for lunch, okay?

09:08.940 --> 09:10.942
Thanks.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.299
For everything.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.355
I can't believe she's actually
back in school.

09:23.390 --> 09:26.791
As abnormal as this is,
it kind of feels normal.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.650
Baby steps.

09:28.700 --> 09:29.792
MAN: ( on PA)
Spencer Hastings,

09:29.830 --> 09:31.593
please report
to the office.

09:31.630 --> 09:32.938
Spencer Hastings,

09:32.970 --> 09:35.188
please report
to the principal's office.

09:41.110 --> 09:42.941
Mom?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.141
Honey, I'm sorry
to have to do this at school.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.738
What's going on?

09:47.820 --> 09:49.947
We have to go home
and pack.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.810
What for?

09:51.850 --> 09:54.011
I'm leaving
your father...

10:01.700 --> 10:02.860
Let's do something nobody else
in this school is doing today.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.091
Let's talk about
somebody other than Alison.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.869
Gladly.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.039
So my girlfriend
is coming into town

10:11.070 --> 10:12.731
from Philly tonight.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.975
I'm having a party
so she can meet all my friends.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.978
I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.102
What's she like?

10:18.150 --> 10:19.105
See for yourself.

10:19.150 --> 10:21.015
The party starts at 7.

10:22.850 --> 10:23.885
Can I bring Travis?

10:23.920 --> 10:24.944
Of course.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.981
Great.
See you later.

10:31.890 --> 10:33.255
( phone speed-dialing )

10:36.100 --> 10:38.022
Is Meli_ssa
comIng WIth us?

10:38.070 --> 10:39.196
You need a jacket.

10:39.230 --> 10:41.767
And that gray sweater
that you love,

10:41.800 --> 10:43.006
let's bring that.

10:43.040 --> 10:43.938
Mom!

10:43.970 --> 10:45.403
Look, I will answer
all of your questions

10:45.440 --> 10:46.338
when we get
to the hotel.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.179
But right now I need you
to stay focused on

10:48.210 --> 10:49.700
helping me get us
out of here.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.775
Mom, I need you to be
honest with me.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.209
I will help you but I need
to understand

10:53.250 --> 10:54.239
what we're running from.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.417
We're not running.

10:55.450 --> 10:56.417
You pulled me out of school

10:56.450 --> 10:58.941
so that we could be gone
before Dad gets home.

10:58.990 --> 10:59.957
Does he even know
that we're leaVIng?

10:59.990 --> 11:02.458
Damn it, Spencer.
When you latch onto things--

11:02.490 --> 11:05.254
I just want to know
the truth!

11:08.360 --> 11:10.999
Your father
did take me to a spa.

11:11.030 --> 11:13.169
ButI never checked in.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.031
I was working with
a private investigator.

11:15.070 --> 11:18.039
Then the night that
Jessica was killed,

11:18.070 --> 11:19.469
your dad and Melissa
told me that they went

11:19.510 --> 11:21.068
to a diner in Ridgeville.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.209
That was a lie.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.874
You think that
both of them...

11:28.920 --> 11:31.388
I thought your father
and I had an understanding.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.151
We always agreed that,
no matter what,

11:34.190 --> 11:37.421
we would never involve you
and Melissa in all of the--

11:39.290 --> 11:40.826
All of the what?

11:49.870 --> 11:50.962
Mom?

11:53.280 --> 11:55.134
I want you to know
that I'll take care of you.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.902
We'll take care
of each other.

12:03.850 --> 12:05.511
EMILY: Spence,
call us back.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.983
We're getting worried.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.051
I_haven't seen Ali
smce fIrst perIod.

12:10.090 --> 12:11.057
Maybe they skipped.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.250
No, All sent a text.

12:12.290 --> 12:13.848
She's in guidance
counselor hell.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.891
With everything going on
with Spencer's family,

12:15.930 --> 12:17.295
I don't like not knowing
where she is.

12:17.330 --> 12:21.494
I was thinking about going
to Jenna's after school.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.098
I can swing
by Spencer's.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.301
Okay, back up. Why would you be
going to Jenna's?

12:25.340 --> 12:27.900
Because I believe
what Toby told Spencer.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.874
And if Jenna's broken
because of what I did...

12:32.150 --> 12:33.469
I don't know,
maybe there's something

12:33.520 --> 12:34.475
I can do to help.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.839
What could you
do to help?

12:35.880 --> 12:36.983
Yeah,
last night you thought

12:37.020 --> 12:38.544
she was staring blind
daggers at you.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.387
Both of you,
back off, okay?

12:40.420 --> 12:42.388
I'm just saying,
if she's not looking for us

12:42.420 --> 12:43.921
or smelling for us, then--

12:43.960 --> 12:45.985
Look, Hanna,
I really hope that you find

12:46.030 --> 12:47.054
a hobby.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.523
And I hope you have
a carefree senior year, Em.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.027
But I've got
to find a way to live

12:51.070 --> 12:52.059
with what I did in New York.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.067
Okay, Aria--

12:53.100 --> 12:54.294
I can be sorry
for her loss.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.907
All right?
That's what I can do.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.908
The glee club's sponsoring
a Frozen sing-a-long tonight.

13:08.450 --> 13:11.317
I think I'm more of
an Adele Dazeem
than Idina Menzel.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.386
It's free pizza
on a school night.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.911
You sure that doesn't trump
20 Questions with your mom?

13:18.060 --> 13:19.049
Is it okay ifI hum?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.421
I'll see you at 7?

13:20.460 --> 13:21.552
Yeah.

13:26.330 --> 13:28.389
I'm surprised
you came to practice.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.566
I heard you went home early.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.160
I wasn't feeling well.
But it passed.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.269
Are you sure you didn't leave
because of Alison?

13:34.310 --> 13:37.302
I know she's your friend,
but even being

13:37.350 --> 13:39.147
in the same room
with her makes me feel sick.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.239
Well, if you're staying
out of school to try

13:41.280 --> 13:43.441
and avoid her, then she still
has power over you.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.845
Then she still
has power over me...

13:45.890 --> 13:48.154
because I can't stand to be
in the same room with her.

13:51.590 --> 13:53.399
I hate seeing
you so upset.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.455
I'm fine.
No, you're not.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.058
You're one of the
bravest people I know,

13:57.100 --> 13:58.863
and I'm not going
to let you forget that.

14:11.450 --> 14:15.238
* ( melancholy ballad,
indistinct lyrics )

14:18.190 --> 14:19.248
Jenna?

14:22.690 --> 14:23.918
Jenna?

14:46.310 --> 14:48.414
( sobbing )

14:50.190 --> 14:51.282
JENNA: Who's there?

15:17.380 --> 15:17.903
Do you
want me to leave?

15:19.410 --> 15:21.571
It's okay if you stay.

15:23.620 --> 15:24.985
Paige?

15:26.220 --> 15:27.414
It's up
to you, Emily.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.925
Thanks for getting us
together, Em.

15:36.530 --> 15:39.090
Paige and I are both luclq
to have you as a friend.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.189
That's the only thing
we have in common.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.507
Paige...

15:51.380 --> 15:55.146
I am ashamed of the way
I treated you.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.078
I put people down to...

16:00.490 --> 16:02.253
feel better
about myself.

16:02.290 --> 16:04.986
You are a terrible person,
Alison.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.558
And I hated you for it.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.659
I didn't care
if you were dead.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.238
I was happy
you were gone.

16:18.610 --> 16:19.736
I'm sorry.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.034
For what you did to me
or for yourself?

16:24.510 --> 16:26.046
For all of it.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.652
I can't believe
you can think about

16:34.690 --> 16:36.282
homework tonight.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.628
And that you would trust me
to give you

16:37.660 --> 16:38.752
your assignments.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.189
You were actually
the first person

16:40.230 --> 16:41.219
that I thought
of when she said

16:41.260 --> 16:42.397
that she was leaving him.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.768
'Cause I remembered
how hard it was for you

16:45.800 --> 16:47.438
when your dad left.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.028
God, I can't believe
he'd risk everything

16:49.070 --> 16:50.162
to kill Mrs. D.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.768
The police were
asking questions about

16:51.810 --> 16:53.368
the girl that was
in Ali's grave...

16:54.380 --> 16:57.178
and he was just
trying to protect me.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.508
He thought Mrs. D.
was gonna set me up
to take the fall for it.

16:59.550 --> 17:00.539
( knocking on door)

17:00.580 --> 17:03.242
Travis is downstairs.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.281
Spencer, I saw your mom
at The Bradbury yesterday.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.514
Is everything
okay at home?

17:06.550 --> 17:10.281
Yeah, we're just
having plumbing issues.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.649
Ohh. Well, tell Veronica
we're here to help

17:11.690 --> 17:12.657
if you need anything.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.624
Thanks, Mrs. Marin.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.138
Spence, you could have
told her the truth.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.262
Not about the murder part,

17:21.300 --> 17:22.597
but about
your parents splitting up.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.562
She would never
judge that.

17:26.710 --> 17:29.076
I'm not really even sure
why I lied.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.441
I know that we've never
really been lIke a warm

17:34.480 --> 17:36.710
and fuzzy family,
but I always thought

17:36.750 --> 17:38.388
that my parents were gonna
stay together.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.695
We're here for you,
Spence.

17:49.260 --> 17:50.420
I promise.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.337
You want
to order some food?

17:54.570 --> 17:57.107
Uh, I already
have plans.

17:57.140 --> 17:58.334
It's a school thing.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.432
Can I tag along?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.471
I invited Paige.

18:03.510 --> 18:05.102
So...

18:05.150 --> 18:06.742
Oh.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.444
Yeah, I get it.

18:12.490 --> 18:15.118
So I'm sure this sounds lame,
but do you care

18:15.160 --> 18:16.684
if I stay for a little bit?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.722
My dad's working late,
and I just...

18:18.760 --> 18:21.490
I don't want to go home
to an empty house.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.194
Yeah.

18:28.700 --> 18:31.100
My mom's in the den
if you need anything.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.904
Em?

18:36.940 --> 18:39.602
When I was talking to Paige

18:39.650 --> 18:41.868
I realized that I owe you
an apology, too.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.481
I always made you think
that your feelings for me

18:47.520 --> 18:48.714
were totally one-sided.

18:50.290 --> 18:51.382
That wasn't true.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.457
Th_ose kisses weren't
just for practIce.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.167
I don't know
what you want me to say.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.365
You don't have
to say anything.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.403
Why are you telling me
this now?

19:11.450 --> 19:13.475
I just thought
you should know.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.258
Caleb?

19:39.670 --> 19:40.898
What are you doing here?

19:44.480 --> 19:46.539
MAN: Hey, blondie,
come hang out with us.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.548
Could you keep it down,
Biff?

19:48.580 --> 19:50.912
This is a coffee shop,
not the locker room.

19:50.950 --> 19:53.316
BIFF: You looking
for a fight, man?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.578
No, no. He's just
a little bit irritable.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.656
He hasn't
had his coffee yet.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.423
Caleb, when did
you get back?

20:01.460 --> 20:02.654
BARISTA: Two coffees
for Hanna.

20:04.930 --> 20:07.569
And...why haven't
you called me?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.363
BARISTA: Hanna.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.429
Caleb, where are you?
Why aren't you answering
my calls?

20:31.990 --> 20:33.992
Are you mad at me?

20:34.030 --> 20:36.498
Can you just call me back
so I can find you?

20:43.510 --> 20:44.568
You dropped your phone.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.705
Thank you.

20:48.740 --> 20:50.776
God, this punch
is so tasty.

20:50.810 --> 20:53.813
It's best consumed
rapidly and repeatedly.

20:53.850 --> 20:54.817
Oh.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.909
Cheers.
Cheers.

20:56.950 --> 20:58.815
( drink splashes )
Ohh!

20:58.850 --> 21:00.989
So, Lucas,

21:01.020 --> 21:04.626
where is your girlfriend?

21:04.660 --> 21:07.458
I...don't see her right now.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.765
Are you sure that
she's even real?

21:10.800 --> 21:13.291
Oh, she's real, all right.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.904
Hanna.
Shh!

21:17.940 --> 21:21.933
Okay, now that is consumed
best rapidly and repeatedly.

21:22.940 --> 21:24.805
Whoa, you okay?

21:24.850 --> 21:25.908
Hey, cowboy,
where have you been?

21:25.950 --> 21:27.099
I've been looking
for you all night.

21:27.150 --> 21:28.947
You're the one that's been
on your phone all nIght, Hanna.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.517
Aw, let me rub
that bald head of yours.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.556
Okay, come on.

21:34.590 --> 21:35.682
I think you've had enough.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.359
Actually, you don't know
what I think.

21:38.390 --> 21:39.823
You don't even know
the half of it.

21:39.860 --> 21:40.929
Come on, come on.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.052
Oh, there we go.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.667
Did I just say that you don't
even know the half of it?

21:46.700 --> 21:47.837
Mm-hmm.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.034
Here you go.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.334
Bridget Woo just told me
she saw Jenna tonight.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.836
She's probably drunk.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.939
Jenna or Bridget?

21:56.980 --> 21:58.345
Bndget
Bndget

21:58.380 --> 22:00.871
She also told me
Shana's dead.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.444
Who are these people?

22:02.480 --> 22:04.118
Jenna's a blind girl
who used to go to our school.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.640
Her and Shana were dating,
right?

22:06.650 --> 22:07.685
I don't know
what they were.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.359
You don't like her?

22:10.390 --> 22:11.948
Alison and Jenna
hated each other.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.548
My friends and I didn't realize
we had been

22:13.600 --> 22:15.556
drafted into their war
before it was too late.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.953
Too late for what?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.922
ANNOUNCER: Three minutes
till show time, folks.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.461
Find your seats
and your duet partners.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.138
So are you Anna or Elsa?

22:23.170 --> 22:24.706
I'm humming.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.073
( car engine starts )

22:58.740 --> 23:00.879
I knew it was you
in my room today.

23:00.910 --> 23:02.878
You scared me.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.844
What were you doing
in my house?

23:04.880 --> 23:07.007
Um--

23:07.050 --> 23:08.745
Do you want to--

23:08.780 --> 23:11.146
Do you want to come inside?
I can make some tea.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.408
What I would like
Is an answer.

23:14.890 --> 23:16.050
I heard about Shana.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.187
So I was just coming to see
if you were okay.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.926
Why would you
care if I'm okay?

23:22.960 --> 23:26.020
Look,
with Ali back, it's just--

23:26.070 --> 23:28.595
It's bringing up a lot of stuff
for everyone, and...

23:29.800 --> 23:31.506
we all feel
really terrIble about

23:31.540 --> 23:32.507
our part in the accident.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.576
_I was-- _
PlacatIng your gUIlt?

23:34.610 --> 23:35.872
Jenna”.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.170
Look, I might be
the last person on earth

23:40.210 --> 23:42.747
that you want
to talk to right now.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.919
But for two years,
we felt that Alison was dead.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.808
So I know how it feels
to lose someone.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.657
Right.

23:50.690 --> 23:51.952
But you still have
your friends.

23:54.060 --> 23:56.051
I don't have
anybody left.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.096
Right, but I guess
that is nobody's fault

24:01.140 --> 24:02.937
but my own.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.429
Hey!

24:07.910 --> 24:10.640
Are you sure you don't
want to come in for that tea?

24:13.050 --> 24:14.813
I didn't really know
Shana that well,

24:14.850 --> 24:15.942
but if you...

24:17.720 --> 24:18.789
if you wanted
to come in and talk

24:18.820 --> 24:20.014
and tell me about her...

24:26.090 --> 24:27.648
I think that would help.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.621
Thank you, Aria.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.989
Yeah.

25:08.300 --> 25:09.631
( clattering )

25:21.980 --> 25:24.016
( wind whistling )

25:35.100 --> 25:36.829
You don't scare me, Mona.

25:36.860 --> 25:39.260
You're not as good of a liar
as you used to be.

25:44.940 --> 25:46.168
I know you were
all in New York

25:46.210 --> 25:47.677
the night Shana was murdered.

25:48.780 --> 25:49.929
And I can prove it.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.149
What do you want, Mona?

25:54.180 --> 25:55.909
What I've always wanted--

25:55.950 --> 25:57.781
and that's for you
to leave town.

25:57.820 --> 26:01.312
I don't care where you
go or how you get there.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.884
I want you gone.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.320
I'm not a threat to you.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.180
You may have convinced
Hanna and the others

26:07.230 --> 26:08.788
that you changed.

26:08.830 --> 26:11.890
And maybe you are trying
to be a decent person,

26:11.930 --> 26:13.739
but that won't
last for long.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.135
People do change.

26:15.170 --> 26:16.933
When someone shows me
who they are,

26:16.970 --> 26:18.062
I believe them.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.361
I don't need to be
taught a lesson

26:19.410 --> 26:20.308
more than once.

26:20.340 --> 26:23.707
You're suddenly
the victim of what, Mona?

26:23.750 --> 26:24.671
My bullying?

26:24.710 --> 26:26.940
What do you call
what you did to those girls?

26:26.980 --> 26:28.971
You almost killed Hanna.

26:30.650 --> 26:33.756
No one feels
worse about that than I do.

26:33.790 --> 26:37.009
But I'm all better now.
Even the doctors say so.

26:37.060 --> 26:39.221
I don't believe you.

26:39.260 --> 26:40.898
If you could prove
that we were in New York,

26:40.930 --> 26:42.921
you would have done
it already.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.690
I'm back and I'm staying,
so get used to it.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.061
No one wants you here.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.863
You're wrong, Mona.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.937
Just like before,
everyone wants to be my friend.

26:51.970 --> 26:53.039
And that's
what you're afraid of.

26:53.070 --> 26:56.676
All I had to do was say
"I'm sorry" to Cindy and Mindy

26:56.710 --> 26:57.904
and they were
practically begging me

26:57.950 --> 26:59.247
to sit at their lunch table.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.942
You're scared because
you know that It's not gonna

27:01.980 --> 27:04.813
take me long to win over
your army of losers.

27:04.850 --> 27:08.013
I made you Loser Mona once,
and you know I can do it
again.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.031
We don't have
to do this.

27:25.070 --> 27:26.901
Leave me alone.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.647
( door opens and closes )

27:38.190 --> 27:40.852
Hey, Han,
we're all at Ali's.

27:40.890 --> 27:43.051
You might be asleep,
but just call us
when you get this.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.152
I don't_thi_nk it was
a c0InCIdence

27:49.200 --> 27:51.418
that all of you were
busy tonight.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.767
Did you see
who was driving?

27:52.800 --> 27:54.995
It couldn't
have been Mona.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.735
She got into that church
way too fast.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.337
She had help.

27:59.370 --> 28:01.076
Sounds like an ambush.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.177
( cup rattling )
You're shaking.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.812
Hey, here.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.051
Well, what did you do
when she slapped you?

28:19.830 --> 28:21.092
I just stared at her.

28:22.230 --> 28:23.322
Look,
I think you're right.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.793
If Mona had
any proof that we were

28:24.830 --> 28:26.718
in New York, she would
have used it by now.

28:26.770 --> 28:28.328
She was just trying
to scare you.

28:28.370 --> 28:29.894
Well, she succeeded.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.248
I would be madder than
a skunk at Travis

28:42.280 --> 28:45.340
if he weren't as baffled
by your behavior as I am.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.154
When you sober up
we're having a serious
talk about consequences.

28:48.190 --> 28:49.987
And yours won't
just be a hangover.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.922
Okay, Mother.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.494
But if you don't stop
spinning the room,
I'm going to throw up.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.258
Thanks for not being
mad at me.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.437
Oh, I'm mad
at you, Hanna.

29:06.470 --> 29:07.835
But I know
you won't remember,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.973
so we'll talk
about it tomorrow.

29:10.010 --> 29:11.272
Okay, Mother.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.268
Why would you do this
to yourself?

29:16.280 --> 29:18.180
Caleb's back.

29:24.890 --> 29:27.154
Ali's really missing her
mom tonight.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.318
Okay.
I will.

29:35.370 --> 29:38.100
She's okay with me
staying over.

29:38.140 --> 29:39.402
She said to give you
a big hug.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.132
You probably don't remember

29:43.180 --> 29:45.375
what I told you when I pulled
you out of that barn.

29:47.310 --> 29:48.811
I remember every word...

29:50.890 --> 29:52.846
but I don't know what's real
and what I made up.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.192
You said you missed me
the most.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.562
You were the hardest one
to leave behind.

30:17.540 --> 30:20.407
Look, I-- I know
that there's no more "A,"

30:20.450 --> 30:22.975
but you should seriously
still lock your door.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.283
You stopped by Paula's?

30:26.320 --> 30:27.480
Yeah, it's key lime.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.619
Why pie?

30:30.660 --> 30:31.979
Why not pie?

30:33.630 --> 30:36.190
Jenna's all alone now.

30:36.230 --> 30:39.324
She's all alone,
and she's blaming herself.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.167
I just wanted to tell her
that she should blame me.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.339
You should both be
blaming Shana.

30:43.370 --> 30:45.201
She was the one that was
holding the gun, remember?

30:48.240 --> 30:49.605
Um...

30:51.510 --> 30:55.947
Ali, she always
thoughtthatJenna
was manipulating Shana,

30:55.980 --> 30:59.609
but I think that Jenna
actually loved her.

30:59.650 --> 31:04.223
Look, Aria, you have to stop
beating yourself up for this.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.888
I don't know how I'm going
to get past it.

31:10.630 --> 31:13.019
Do you see this?

31:13.070 --> 31:15.095
This is what she did to me.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.166
I'm luclq to be alive,
and so are you.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.599
Just like she told you,
remember?

31:20.640 --> 31:23.200
Shana wasn't
playIng a game.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.569
I'm so sorry.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.051
I don't ever want
to hear you say

31:36.090 --> 31:37.580
you're sorry again.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.591
* Every breath you take

31:44.600 --> 31:47.160
* Every move you make

31:49.070 --> 31:53.507
* Every bond you break,
every step you take *

31:53.540 --> 31:55.508
* I'll be watching you

31:58.150 --> 32:03.042
* Every single day

32:03.080 --> 32:06.584
Ali? Are you asleep?

32:06.620 --> 32:11.421
* Every game you play,
every night you stay *

32:11.460 --> 32:13.325
* I'll be watching you

32:18.200 --> 32:20.259
* Oh, can't you see

32:22.240 --> 32:24.606
* You belong to me

32:27.140 --> 32:29.404
* How my poor heart aches

32:29.440 --> 32:33.570
* With every step you take

32:38.050 --> 32:40.439
* Every move you make

32:42.490 --> 32:45.584
* Every vow you break

32:45.630 --> 32:47.052
Does that hurt?

32:47.090 --> 32:48.250
I can handle it.

32:55.570 --> 32:57.333
If you feel
as bad as you look--

32:57.370 --> 32:58.667
Not so loud.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.770
So how does Mona know
that we were in New York?

33:01.810 --> 33:03.300
She's Mona.

33:03.340 --> 33:05.604
But how did she send
that "New York minute" text

33:05.650 --> 33:08.039
to your burner phone
the night we got back into town?

33:08.080 --> 33:09.274
The other day I learned

33:09.320 --> 33:11.117
how to make my own
satellite on the Web.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.617
What are you going
to do with a satellite?

33:12.650 --> 33:14.982
The point is that
you can learn to do
anything on the Web.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.221
Using a Bluetooth
sniper rifle,

33:18.260 --> 33:19.625
the hacker
can recere SIgnals

33:19.660 --> 33:22.128
from a thousand yards away.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.388
You can be
blue-snarfed In seconds,

33:23.430 --> 33:24.795
and the entire contents of
your phone WIll be

33:24.830 --> 33:26.229
wirelessly uploaded.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.397
So Mona blue-snarfed us?

33:42.820 --> 33:43.775
What's going on?

33:43.820 --> 33:46.448
Some people really did
hope that you changed.

33:46.490 --> 33:48.253
We're not afraid of you,
Mona.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.258
Afraid of me?

33:52.530 --> 33:55.658
What lies has she told you?

33:55.700 --> 33:57.497
Alison attacked me
last night.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.361
And when she started
saying things

33:59.400 --> 34:01.265
like she could
make me disappear,

34:01.300 --> 34:05.066
I turned my phone
to video.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.138
You're scared

34:10.180 --> 34:11.306
because you know
it's not gonna take me long

34:11.350 --> 34:13.341
to win over
your army of losers.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.416
I made you Loser Mona once

34:15.450 --> 34:17.338
and you know
I can do it again.

34:23.590 --> 34:25.080
It's...

34:39.140 --> 34:41.574
That is the last time
I underestimate that bitch.

34:41.610 --> 34:43.532
How are you going to try
and spin this one, Ali?

34:43.580 --> 34:44.774
I mean, we know
you're a great liar,

34:44.810 --> 34:46.471
_ _ _so I'm sure
thIs IS gomg to be a good one.

34:46.510 --> 34:48.614
Everything I told you last night
was true.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.118
She slapped me first.
I swear it.

34:51.150 --> 34:53.141
I didn't tell you
that I slapped her back

34:53.190 --> 34:54.452
because I felt terrible
about it.

34:54.490 --> 34:56.617
"Loser Mona"?
Really?

34:56.660 --> 34:57.809
Are we back to that again?

34:57.860 --> 34:59.122
I know how it looks.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.457
But you know what
she's capable of.

35:00.490 --> 35:02.253
I mean, she set me up.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.722
Come on, guys.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.569
Mona's found a lot of ways
to trick us

35:05.600 --> 35:07.465
into believing things were real
when they're not.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.866
I mean, Spence,
you landed in Radley

35:09.900 --> 35:12.334
because of one of those
elaborate stunts she pulled.

35:12.370 --> 35:13.769
Maybe Mona deserved it.

35:13.810 --> 35:15.732
But you went
out of your way to lie to us.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.532
Again.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.562
Nice car.

35:40.730 --> 35:42.391
It used to be mine.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.280
They don't want things
to go back to the way they were.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.311
They remember
how Alison treated them.

36:00.350 --> 36:02.454
Like they were her dolls.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.378
Good.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.785
Then maybe
we can really get rid of her.

36:21.310 --> 36:25.371
So what does a world
without "A" look like?

36:29.450 --> 36:31.338
Well, it turns out
the Hastings don't need "A"

36:31.390 --> 36:32.743
to make a mess of things.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.580
We can do that
all on our own.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.962
Are you mad at me
for waiting so long to tell you?

36:47.630 --> 36:50.599
Spence, get over here.

36:59.380 --> 37:03.373
All I want you to know
is that you're never alone.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.313
Not even for a second.

37:06.350 --> 37:09.615
* And you're quick to forgive
when I make a mistake *

37:09.660 --> 37:12.788
_ * You love me
In the bunk of an eye *

37:12.830 --> 37:16.459
* I don't deserve your love

37:16.500 --> 37:20.596
* But you give it to me
anyway *

37:20.630 --> 37:24.805
* Can't get enough

37:24.840 --> 37:27.502
* You're everything I need

37:27.540 --> 37:31.977
* And when I walk away

37:32.010 --> 37:38.483
* You take off running
and come right after me *

37:38.520 --> 37:41.318
* It's what you do

37:41.360 --> 37:44.887
* And I don't deserve you

37:44.930 --> 37:46.522
Ithought
I'd find you here.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.738
Why haven't you returned
my calls?

37:59.940 --> 38:01.976
Travis is a nice guy.

38:03.910 --> 38:06.049
I didn't come back
to screw that up.

38:17.390 --> 38:19.881
Did you change your hair
because Alison's back?

38:22.130 --> 38:24.052
Probably.

38:29.740 --> 38:33.938
Em, I know I screwed up.

38:35.110 --> 38:37.670
Em, will you look at me
please?

38:37.710 --> 38:40.042
Why wouldn't you
just tell us the truth?

38:40.080 --> 38:42.617
It's so much easier
than lyIng.

38:46.550 --> 38:48.654
I didn't tell you everything
because I was afraid

38:48.690 --> 38:50.555
that I was gonna lose you.

38:54.430 --> 38:56.318
Please.

39:07.940 --> 39:10.738
That's not going
to fix this.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.617
NEWS ANCHOR: ( on TV)
There is breaking news tonight

39:18.650 --> 39:20.686
in the investigation
of the Jane Doe

39:20.720 --> 39:23.951

Did Miranda
find her family?

39:35.540 --> 39:37.030
I don't know.

39:39.040 --> 39:42.032
The night you left Ravenswood
was the last time I saw her.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.402
( cell phone beeps )

39:50.050 --> 39:51.142
You have to come with me.

announcing the identity

This mystery has continued
to haunt Rosewood

40:08.070 --> 40:09.628

40:12.640 --> 40:14.062

right now

40:16.940 --> 40:18.202

the only murders...

40:18.240 --> 40:19.639
Are they together now?

40:21.650 --> 40:23.641
I had one sip of beer.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.012
WOMAN: Oh, here he comes,
we're going live.

She was a 17-year-old patient
at the Radley Institution

40:48.240 --> 40:49.798
and was believed

40:49.840 --> 40:52.946
to have run away
from the hospital on the night

40:52.980 --> 40:56.245
that Alison DiLaurentis
was allegedly kidnapped.

40:56.280 --> 40:57.713
Did they just say
"allegedly"?

40:57.750 --> 40:59.809
The victim's parents
have been notified

40:59.850 --> 41:02.182
and the family is requesting
at this time

41:02.220 --> 41:05.155
