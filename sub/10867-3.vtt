00:28.988 --> 00:32.198
Gary: Gramps wants me to track
down the Old Midnight Society,

00:32.198 --> 00:34.034
get their clues, find
The Silver Sight

00:34.034 --> 00:36.203
and destroy it once
and for all...

00:36.203 --> 00:38.414
like they should
have done years ago.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.832
Tell us about the
Silver Sight again?

00:39.832 --> 00:42.627
Well it's a charm,
probably a small thing,

00:42.627 --> 00:45.504
but it's got some kind of power
that can really hurt people.

00:45.504 --> 00:46.965
Oh man I'm not liking this.

00:46.965 --> 00:49.008
Your gramps was a
good guy, right?

00:49.008 --> 00:50.593
The best.

00:50.593 --> 00:55.514
I gotta find out why he died.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.309
Okay, give me a name quick.
Before I change my mind.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.060
Alright.
Thanks Meg.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.772
Why don't we just find
the guy that hid it

01:02.772 --> 01:03.940
in the first place?

01:03.940 --> 01:06.400
He died the day after he hid it.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.487
Oh man, this just
keeps getting better.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.489
I'll help.

01:11.489 --> 01:12.740
Me too...

01:12.740 --> 01:15.117
but, not by myself.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.745
No problem, how 'bout
the two work together.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.455
Alright.

01:19.455 --> 01:22.041
Don't you think this is a
little bit out of bounds?

01:22.041 --> 01:27.005
It's alright Quinn, you
don't have to help man.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.342
You know I'll help.

01:31.342 --> 01:35.471
Cuz if this gets nasty,
you're gonna need me.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.348
Great.

01:37.348 --> 01:39.684
Alright, Tuck and I'll
take care of the fourth name.

01:39.684 --> 01:42.520
Now remember, it's the pieces
of the record that we need.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.396
That's where the clues are.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.649
We'll meet tomorrow in my dorm
room for a status report, ok?

01:46.649 --> 01:50.110
Alright!
Let's hit it!

01:51.070 --> 01:54.073
Boy you stink!

01:54.573 --> 01:56.075
Sorry...

01:56.075 --> 01:57.242
Hey check this out.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.955
Midnight Society...
1937.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.081
Wow.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.422
So how'd you guys do?

02:10.422 --> 02:12.050
Not good.

02:12.050 --> 02:14.343
We've been to the
library, we've been on-line,

02:14.343 --> 02:17.889
we've called everywhere, but we
can't seem to find any record of

02:17.889 --> 02:19.348
Bruce McGorrill.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.683
Well there's gotta be
some trace somewhere.

02:20.683 --> 02:21.893
Keep looking alright.

02:21.893 --> 02:24.144
[telephone rings]

02:24.144 --> 02:24.864
Hello?

02:26.105 --> 02:27.314
Grandma??

02:27.314 --> 02:28.154
HELLO??

02:29.608 --> 02:30.609
HELLO!

02:30.609 --> 02:31.610
What?

02:31.610 --> 02:32.330
C'MON!

02:33.738 --> 02:35.740
Yo, easy!

02:35.740 --> 02:38.117
Why are they...

02:38.117 --> 02:40.661
whoa, what's with that smell?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.204
Megan's been in the sewer.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.665
Nah, smells more
like bad perfume.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.500
That's it.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.210
If anyone wants me I'll
be hangin' with the

02:48.210 --> 02:51.171
stinky mole people.

02:51.171 --> 02:51.921
Ha!

02:53.883 --> 02:55.093
Hey, what's this?

02:55.093 --> 02:56.510
The original Midnight Society.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.096
Which one's Donna Tilton?

02:58.096 --> 03:00.514
I think that's her.

03:00.514 --> 03:04.309
Excellent!
I can use this!

03:05.603 --> 03:07.312
We have the worst
assignment, you know.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.647
Lemme try.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.524
A guy can't just
vanish without a trace.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.943
Yeah!

03:11.943 --> 03:13.402
But this guy's been
dead for what...?

03:13.402 --> 03:15.404
Like, fifty years now.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.865
Even so, there's gotta
be some record of him,

03:17.865 --> 03:19.700
somewhere.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.120
We've tried the town hall,
we've tried the hospitals,

03:22.120 --> 03:23.662
we've tried the schools...

03:23.662 --> 03:27.125
There's nowhere else to look!

03:30.586 --> 03:35.299
It couldn't be
that easy, could it?

03:38.302 --> 03:39.302
M...

03:40.763 --> 03:41.763
M C.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.558
McGorrill! B!

03:44.558 --> 03:45.977
His name's Bruce!

03:45.977 --> 03:48.687
He's dead, why would he
be in the phone book?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.731
I've got another one for ya.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.483
Look at the address.

03:52.483 --> 03:56.403
Who would live there?

03:59.490 --> 04:03.452
Kinda eerie when it's empty.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.621
Hey!
Look at that.

04:05.621 --> 04:09.208
Nah, those things creep me out.

04:09.208 --> 04:13.587
Don't be chicken
it's just a goof.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.865
Want to hear your fortune Vange?

04:46.411 --> 04:47.830
C'mon!

04:47.830 --> 04:49.414
We don't have much...

04:49.414 --> 04:52.210
Whoa there, I
didn't mean to spook ya.

04:52.210 --> 04:53.961
Are you Bob McGorrill?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.629
Far's I know.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.297
Bruce McGorrill's brother?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.258
Right again.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.759
You okay now?

05:00.759 --> 05:02.094
Yeah.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.679
Thanks for seeing us.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.347
Oh no, thank YOU.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.392
I've been waiting a
long time for your call.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.852
You have???

05:09.852 --> 05:13.605
Ever since my brother died.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.399
How DID he die?

05:15.399 --> 05:16.239
Well...

05:17.943 --> 05:21.030
it's right over there.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.702
Bruce loved this place...

05:26.702 --> 05:28.120
he loved having fun.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.621
That's the kind of guy he was.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.665
You know he bought Playland?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.958
He did?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.418
Yup.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.129
Youngest amusement
park owner in the world.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.672
Then he...

05:38.672 --> 05:41.759
passed it on to me.

05:41.759 --> 05:47.765
I suppose I should retire, but
being here makes me feel as if

05:47.765 --> 05:50.059
he's still around.

05:50.059 --> 05:53.687
This was his favorite ride.

05:53.687 --> 06:00.278
One day he climbed
up to fix a cable...

06:00.278 --> 06:02.154
slipped...

06:02.154 --> 06:04.240
and he fell.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.867
So it was an accident?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.202
That's what they think.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.454
What do YOU think?

06:10.454 --> 06:14.041
Bruce knew this ride better'n
a spider knows it's web.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.377
There's no way
he'd fall on his own.

06:17.377 --> 06:21.799
Somebody or, some
thing pushed him.

06:24.343 --> 06:29.140
So... we came
to get something...?

06:29.140 --> 06:31.309
Oh, yeah, right.

06:31.309 --> 06:34.312
C'mon, this way.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.398
Bruce told me that someday,
somebody'd come looking for this

06:38.398 --> 06:41.652
thing, and I should only give
it to 'em if there was more

06:41.652 --> 06:43.737
than one person.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.073
Why do you suppose that is?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.407
No clue.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.495
My brother was a good person.

06:51.495 --> 06:55.749
A long time ago he took
something terrible and hid it so

06:55.749 --> 06:57.584
his friends wouldn't get hurt.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.588
I don't know what it was, but
I think it had something to do

07:01.588 --> 07:04.258
with his death.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.717
You still want this?

07:05.717 --> 07:06.844
Not really.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.888
Yes we do.

07:15.019 --> 07:17.355
What IS this?

07:17.355 --> 07:19.064
Just like Bruce.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.774
He was a riddle-man.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.362
He loved puzzles,
brainteasers and what not.

07:24.362 --> 07:25.904
I don't get it.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.325
429 32nd street.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.827
Well that's the
house we grew up in.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.412
I don't know what
the picture is,

07:33.412 --> 07:36.832
my guess is, whatever it
is you're looking for,

07:36.832 --> 07:38.959
you'll find it in our old house.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.671
I told you we had
the worst assignment.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.589
Thanks Mr. McGorrill.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.175
Yeah.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.970
Kids?

07:49.970 --> 07:53.098
Bruce and those Midnight Society
friends of his got mixed up

07:53.098 --> 07:54.433
in something ugly.

07:54.433 --> 07:59.855
Do what you gotta
do just, be careful.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.820
This house is right by mine.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.949
Lets call Gary and tell
'em we're on our way!

08:10.949 --> 08:15.620
Wait, my shoe lace.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.800
Andy?!

08:28.800 --> 08:31.178
HEY ANDY!

08:42.106 --> 08:43.857
Nobody's home.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.361
I don't think anybody's
lived here in a long time.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.321
Come on.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.255
I don't get it.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.966
There's not enough information.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.305
Hold on.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.488
YES!!!

09:22.396 --> 09:23.981
Aww, cool!

09:23.981 --> 09:25.023
This is it!

09:25.023 --> 09:26.858
He hid the record in here.

09:26.858 --> 09:30.404
Yeah but it says he hid it...

09:31.155 --> 09:33.073
Down THERE!

09:38.703 --> 09:40.789
Ohhh no!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.883
You okay?

09:51.883 --> 09:53.885
If you are.

09:53.885 --> 09:57.222
I got you, no sweat.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.519
It must be behind
one of these rocks.

10:01.519 --> 10:05.272
[gurgling sound]

10:05.272 --> 10:07.316
Was that your stomach?

10:07.316 --> 10:11.403
Gimme a break.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.989
Did you hear that?

10:13.989 --> 10:16.908
Hear what?

10:18.618 --> 10:21.497
Andy, there's something in the
well!

10:21.497 --> 10:24.708
Then hurry up!

10:26.544 --> 10:27.545
Oh!

10:27.545 --> 10:31.173
I found something!

10:33.467 --> 10:35.260
I GOT IT!

10:37.304 --> 10:40.057
Andy!
Pull me up!

10:40.057 --> 10:41.975
It's caught!

10:41.975 --> 10:46.688
Andy get me out of here!

10:50.901 --> 10:52.694
Andy!!!

10:56.781 --> 10:58.116
Andy!!!

11:00.244 --> 11:02.413
Andy!!!

11:03.747 --> 11:04.587
Andy!!!

11:14.299 --> 11:16.594
What was that?

11:16.594 --> 11:18.803
I don't think I want to know.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.888
Oh.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.766
But we got it.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.185
"Know your true enemy"?

11:27.145 --> 11:30.107
Gary: After what we've
seen, I'm convinced,

11:30.107 --> 11:32.067
that we've got to
find the Silver Sight

11:32.067 --> 11:34.736
and destroy it.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.239
We can't ask you
guys to keep going.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.366
You should take off.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.993
We still don't get
what The Silver Sight is,

11:41.993 --> 11:43.912
but we've seen it
hurt a lotta people.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.664
Yeah.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.125
I think we all want to be there
when this bad boy goes down.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.126
Really?

11:49.126 --> 11:51.629
All of you?

11:51.629 --> 11:53.213
Spin the disc, man.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.839
Alright.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.092
We've uncovered a long
trail of terror and sadness.

11:57.092 --> 12:01.012
Let's hope this helps us end it.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.151
If you're listening to this it
means you're working together,

12:14.151 --> 12:16.069
and that's good.

12:16.069 --> 12:20.073
I hope I'm with you, but I'm
afraid I might be the next

12:20.073 --> 12:21.617
victim of The Silver Sight.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.994
This thing has
got to be stopped!

12:23.994 --> 12:29.207
Whatever it promises, the
evil it delivers is far worse.

12:29.207 --> 12:34.463
Remember, it was the power of
the group that raised the de,

12:34.463 --> 12:38.258
it'll take the power of
the group to destroy it...

12:38.258 --> 12:41.219
but you have to know
who your true enemy is.

12:41.219 --> 12:45.223
Don't give in to
it's dark promises.

12:45.223 --> 12:48.143
Good luck...
good bye...

12:48.143 --> 12:51.313
good bye...
good bye.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.487
He was killed the next day.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.989
So what should we do?

13:00.989 --> 13:03.950
Let's look at the clues.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.202
Listen to the music.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.870
Not all the eyes are brown.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.540
It's a race that has no winners.
Many ups and downs.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.458
Know your true enemy.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.544
Who's the true enemy?

13:13.544 --> 13:16.171
The traitor that
used the Silver Sight?

13:16.171 --> 13:18.006
Well that's Laing Candle.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.966
It has to be,
everyone else is gone.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.720
He put Vince in the hospital
to try to get to Donna Tilton.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.221
And nearly killed
me in the sewer.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.430
He could have been at Grandma's

13:25.430 --> 13:27.766
looking for the record.
-I got it.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.060
He wants The Silver
Sight man, no doubt!

13:30.060 --> 13:31.102
Maybe we should go...

13:31.102 --> 13:32.145
Wait.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.356
What did you say?

13:34.356 --> 13:35.649
I said I got it.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.984
Got what?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.778
I know where he hid
The Silver Sight.

13:39.778 --> 13:43.240
It's all right there.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.347
Listen to the music.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.768
A race that has no winners
with many ups and downs.

14:10.768 --> 14:13.144
I'll bet it's all right here.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.938
The music on the record!

14:14.938 --> 14:16.273
Merry go round music!

14:16.273 --> 14:18.400
And Bruce
McGorrill owned Playland.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.068
So where is it?

14:20.068 --> 14:21.318
Wait.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.489
Yeah, oh yeah.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.865
What??

14:25.865 --> 14:27.951
The last clue.
Not all the eyes are brown.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.203
I'm seeing a lot of
brown eyes here, man.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.580
The Silver Sight!

14:31.580 --> 14:36.460
One of the eyes must be silver!

14:47.011 --> 14:49.097
Um...

14:49.097 --> 14:50.682
Hey guys.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.517
I think I got something.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.185
Look.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.690
That's not silver it's blue.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.112
Blue paint.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.739
It's silver!

15:05.739 --> 15:08.867
Oh man that's it!
That's The Silver Sight.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.749
It's warm.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.126
Like it's alive.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.719
Did you see that?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.689
What's up with that?

15:38.689 --> 15:40.816
It's like the more
people who touch it,

15:40.816 --> 15:42.192
the more it responds.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.402
That's what the record said.

15:44.402 --> 15:48.615
It's all about
power of the group.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.575
Of course.

15:50.575 --> 15:53.953
Maybe we should all
touch it, together.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.195
[calliope music]

16:23.274 --> 16:26.904
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!

16:31.449 --> 16:32.450
Congratulations!

16:32.450 --> 16:33.952
You win!

16:33.952 --> 16:36.747
I tried to scare you off,
but you were all too good.

16:36.747 --> 16:40.083
And now, The
Silver Sight is yours!

16:41.960 --> 16:45.964
Alright.
Then tell me what it is.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.549
Don't you know?

16:47.549 --> 16:49.467
It's the power to conquer.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.845
Armies have won wars with it.

16:51.845 --> 16:55.473
Kingdoms have toppled,
cities have fallen...

16:55.473 --> 16:58.727
and now, it's all yours.

16:58.727 --> 17:02.105
Uhhh... we're not exactly
at war with anyone.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.565
Sure you are!

17:03.565 --> 17:04.816
Everyone has enemies...

17:04.816 --> 17:08.862
a mean parent, a
bad teacher, a bully,

17:08.862 --> 17:12.616
anyone who stands
between you and what you want.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.910
Just tell The
Silver Sight and POOF!

17:14.910 --> 17:16.787
They're gone forever!

17:16.787 --> 17:17.871
And who are YOU?

17:17.871 --> 17:20.248
I'm here to help you along.

17:25.963 --> 17:28.381
Uhh ohh.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.925
Put that thing down son.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.843
You're playing with fire.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.471
Here's your first chance.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.473
Tell The Silver
Sight he's your enemy.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.934
He's not trying
to help you Gary.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.019
No?
Then what IS he doing?

17:41.019 --> 17:43.814
He is a demon
that's collecting souls!

17:43.814 --> 17:46.232
That thing may get rid
of your enemies for you,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.902
but their souls end up
trapped forever in that

17:48.902 --> 17:50.236
vicious little charm.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.738
Who are YOU to talk?

17:51.738 --> 17:53.949
You're the traitor who
used The Silver Sight!

17:53.949 --> 17:56.994
Don't you get it?

17:56.994 --> 17:58.996
It wasn't just me.

17:58.996 --> 18:00.664
We ALL used it!

18:00.664 --> 18:01.873
What???

18:01.873 --> 18:03.374
No way!
-It's true!

18:03.374 --> 18:05.752
It made Donna popular,
it made Eleanor rich,

18:05.752 --> 18:07.754
it even helped Bruce
buy this Amusement park.

18:07.754 --> 18:13.176
But it wasn't just one person,
we all used The Silver Sight.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.385
Not Grandpa Gene.

18:14.385 --> 18:17.014
Yes, Gene too.

18:17.014 --> 18:19.808
But we didn't know it was evil.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.435
We didn't know what
horrors it would bring.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.562
By the time we
realized it was too late.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.605
I don't believe you!

18:25.605 --> 18:27.524
Now, Gary.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.442
Tell The Silver Sight he's
your enemy and he'll be gone.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.904
What happened to my Grandfather?

18:32.904 --> 18:35.239
He was a good man.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.826
He tried to find the
charm and destroy it,

18:37.826 --> 18:39.494
but something happened.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.413
He got scared, his
heart couldn't take it.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.458
I think he got too close...

18:45.458 --> 18:48.503
he got burned by that demon.

18:48.503 --> 18:49.880
Who are you going to believe?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.464
A kid like me?

18:51.464 --> 18:54.258
Or the guy who broke
into your granmdma's house?

18:54.258 --> 18:57.470
I was just trying to put the
clues together before you did.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.474
I was trying to
protect you kids!

19:01.474 --> 19:03.768
Please Gary...

19:03.768 --> 19:06.063
give it to me.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.065
I don't know what to do.

19:08.065 --> 19:10.400
The last clue,
know your true enemy.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.738
That's the only way to beat it.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.073
Gary?

19:17.407 --> 19:18.909
Gary?

19:20.410 --> 19:24.998
Whatever happens, we're in
this as a group, right?

19:24.998 --> 19:26.041
You.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.043
You lied to us from the start.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.669
I was trying to protect you!

19:29.669 --> 19:30.962
You broke into my
grandmother's house,

19:30.962 --> 19:32.797
and you nearly got Megan killed.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.466
I was looking
for clues, I swear!

19:35.466 --> 19:37.427
He's your enemy Gary.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.970
Call him your enemy.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.389
You should have
told us the truth.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.766
You wouldn't have believed me!

19:42.766 --> 19:45.351
Do it Gary, this is
just the beginning!

19:45.351 --> 19:48.646
Yeah, I know who
the true enemy is...

19:48.646 --> 19:50.774
and I'm going to stop him.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.070
Use it!
Use it!

19:55.070 --> 19:55.920
The true enemy...

20:01.743 --> 20:03.078
IS YOU!

20:03.078 --> 20:05.246
What???

20:05.246 --> 20:05.996
No!

20:06.873 --> 20:07.773
You can't do that!

20:13.630 --> 20:14.830
Noooooo!!!

20:41.992 --> 20:43.072
Noooooo!!

20:58.591 --> 20:59.911
Nooooooo!!!

21:47.473 --> 21:51.061
They've all been released!

21:51.728 --> 21:53.604
Gary?

21:54.438 --> 21:57.150
It's over Grandma.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.736
Where's The Silver Sight?

21:59.736 --> 22:01.238
It disappeared.

22:01.238 --> 22:04.824
I think when it lost the
souls, it lost its power.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.911
What about HIM?

22:11.998 --> 22:12.999
You alright?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.559
Yes I am now.

22:18.171 --> 22:22.300
Your grandfather would have
been proud of you, son.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.550
Gary!

22:25.678 --> 22:28.681
Does this end the story?

22:28.681 --> 22:34.437
Yeah, the story ends here.

23:12.725 --> 23:16.520
So the demon boy never
trapped another soul,

23:16.520 --> 23:21.567
because The Silver Sight
was destroyed forever.

23:21.567 --> 23:22.693
The end.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.487
Good story, Gene.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.197
Thank you Eleanor.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.116
Laing, could you
put out the fire?

23:28.116 --> 23:31.452
Sorry, gotta run.

23:31.452 --> 23:32.829
It's okay, I got it Gene.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.873
Thanks Bruce.

23:35.873 --> 23:38.459
Nothing like that
could ever happen to us...

23:38.459 --> 23:40.878
could it?

23:40.878 --> 23:45.133
Not in a million years.
