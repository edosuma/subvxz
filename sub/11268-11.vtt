        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:08.408 --> 00:11.043
 Lilith, do we have to do this? 

00:11.111 --> 00:14.546
Frasier, making out a will      
is a sensible precaution,       

00:14.614 --> 00:16.448
and one you've been             
avoiding for months.            

00:16.516 --> 00:18.350
We're seeing the lawyer         
this afternoon,                 

00:18.418 --> 00:20.486
and we have to get              
these questions answered.       

00:20.553 --> 00:22.021
                  Look, darling,

00:22.088 --> 00:24.857
         I find this entire will
        discussion troubling.   

00:24.924 --> 00:27.826
        It's not easy to talk   
          about one's mortality.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.628
                    Oh, just the
                thought of...   

00:29.696 --> 00:32.197
         of being apart from you
      and-and little Frederick--

00:32.265 --> 00:35.334
                it's... well,   
            it's-it's just hard.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.935
So, who gets the wok?           

00:37.003 --> 00:39.772
             The wok?!          

00:39.839 --> 00:42.374
            My God, woman, we're
    talking about death here!   

00:42.442 --> 00:43.642
        My death, your death,   

00:43.710 --> 00:45.044
          the end of everything!

00:45.111 --> 00:47.813
    Being lowered into the grave
         in a silk-lined casket!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.615
Yes. And?                       

00:49.683 --> 00:51.617
              And it's upsetting

00:51.685 --> 00:53.619
             to mammals like me!

00:55.121 --> 00:57.022
                Look, Lilith,   

00:57.090 --> 01:00.159
         all my life, I've had a
    problem talking about death.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.995
         I know it's irrational,
        but I can't help feeling

01:03.063 --> 01:05.164
                that if you talk
         about it, it'll happen.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.999
Well, Frasier,                  
it will happen.                 

01:07.067 --> 01:08.667
                        Stop it.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.302
What, do you think              

01:10.370 --> 01:13.238
if I hadn't mentioned it,       
you'd live forever?             

01:14.741 --> 01:16.642
                 Well, now we'll
            never know, will we?

01:18.878 --> 01:20.846

02:32.585 --> 02:33.552
    Hi, Mr. Krapence.           

02:33.620 --> 02:34.687
PAUL:                           
Hiya, Woody.                    

02:34.754 --> 02:36.522
  Where's, uh, Norm and Cliff?  

02:36.589 --> 02:38.357
    I guess they're at work.    
         I don't know.          

02:38.425 --> 02:41.627
      You got a cute sense      
 of humor, Woody. I like that.  

02:42.762 --> 02:45.130
                Uh, I bet you   
                  Norm and Cliff

02:45.198 --> 02:46.598
             are doing something
                     really fun.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.001
                Those guys never
         include me in anything.

02:49.069 --> 02:52.371
What is it about me             
that's such a turnoff?          

02:52.439 --> 02:55.374
                 Normally, Paul,

02:55.442 --> 02:57.743
            with a setup like   
         that, I'd go for blood,

02:57.811 --> 03:00.346
                  but I can tell
            you're a little hurt

03:00.413 --> 03:03.315
          and a little upset, so
    I'm gonna go easy on you.   

03:03.383 --> 03:05.617
                It's your looks.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.654
          What am I, everybody's
                punching bag?   

03:08.722 --> 03:10.622
Oh, come on, lighten up,        
Mr. Krapence.                   

03:10.690 --> 03:12.558
     Hey, you want to hear      
          a funny joke          

03:12.625 --> 03:14.693
    that Mr. Clavin told me     
         the other day?         

03:14.761 --> 03:15.861
            Sure. What the hell.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.062
All right.                      

03:17.130 --> 03:18.530
(laughs)                        
Okay.                           

03:18.665 --> 03:20.532
What's round,                   
looks like an owl,              

03:20.600 --> 03:22.735
wears glasses                   
and goofy orange suspenders?    

03:22.802 --> 03:24.203
        (laughs)                

03:27.741 --> 03:29.675
             I don't know. What?

03:29.743 --> 03:32.011
            Nothing.            

03:34.414 --> 03:35.881
        Hey, everybody.         

03:35.949 --> 03:37.383
                Welcome back.   

03:37.450 --> 03:40.052
     May I inquire as to exactly
     where the hell you've been?

03:40.120 --> 03:42.054
Vera?                           

03:44.924 --> 03:46.492
    You know, I'm sick of the   
          way you guys treat me.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.093
                You waltz off   
                God knows where,

03:48.161 --> 03:49.728
                and you leave me
              here with nobody--

03:49.796 --> 03:51.363
             and I mean nobody--
                     to talk to.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.199
  Hey, I love you, too, Paul.   

03:54.267 --> 03:56.135
He's trying awfully hard        
to fit in, huh?                 

03:56.202 --> 03:58.103
A little too hard               
if you ask me.                  

03:58.171 --> 04:00.039
All he does is sit there        
whimpering and whining,         

04:00.106 --> 04:01.540
feeling sorry                   
for himself saying,             

04:01.608 --> 04:03.542
"Include me. Include me.        
Include me."                    

04:03.610 --> 04:04.977
You know, that stuff            
doesn't work.                   

04:05.145 --> 04:07.246
                 Well, it worked
                 for you, Cliff.

04:07.313 --> 04:10.582
The point is,                   
it's not going to work twice.   

04:10.650 --> 04:12.818
      Woody, where's Sam?       

04:12.886 --> 04:14.186
    Oh, he's in the office,     
        Miss Howe.              

04:14.254 --> 04:15.788
  Hey, get your butt out here,  
         Mister Macho!          

04:15.855 --> 04:17.389
     We've been going at it     
         for six months         

04:17.457 --> 04:19.425
like a couple of monkeys,       
  and I'm still not pregnant!   

04:21.827 --> 04:24.596
          H-Honey, there-there's
                an inside voice,

04:24.664 --> 04:26.732
                and then there's
            an outside voice.   

04:26.800 --> 04:28.867
        I think that was your   
    outside voice, don't you?   

04:28.935 --> 04:30.235
You know, guess who came        
to visit this morning.          

04:30.303 --> 04:32.504
Mr. Charlie.                    
That's right, my period.        

04:32.572 --> 04:34.873
                  That means....

04:34.941 --> 04:36.975
         You'd think they'd have
          a little more respect.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.511
        Some of us are trying   
         to drink our beer here.

04:39.579 --> 04:42.314
What, uh, kind of puts you      
off your beer, does it?         

04:42.382 --> 04:44.283
        Well, no, not really.   

04:44.351 --> 04:46.385
                 It'd take a lot
                more to do that.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.553
Oh, yeah?                       

04:47.620 --> 04:49.855
Yeah, well, what, uh...         
what-what would it take?        

04:49.923 --> 04:51.757
                I don't know.   

04:51.825 --> 04:53.726
How about a plate               
of meatloaf                     

04:53.793 --> 04:56.128
with an abscess on it?          

04:57.364 --> 04:59.298
                        (laughs)
                             No.

04:59.366 --> 05:02.835
Uh, and how about a, uh,        
bowl full of scabs?             

05:05.372 --> 05:06.638
        All right.              

05:06.706 --> 05:08.741
Well, how about a...?           

05:09.876 --> 05:12.378
                     Oh, my God.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.380
              That's disgusting.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.482
            Where do you come   
             up with that stuff?

05:16.549 --> 05:18.150
Hey... yeah.                    
                    Yuck.       

05:21.621 --> 05:23.989
        But it wasn't enough.   

05:24.057 --> 05:25.791
          According to the books
         that I've been reading,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.860
             I should definitely
             be pregnant by now.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.061
    I think maybe we're going   

05:29.129 --> 05:30.262
                to have to see a
        fertility specialist.   

05:30.330 --> 05:31.196
            A what?             

05:31.264 --> 05:33.365
    A fertility specialist.     

05:33.433 --> 05:35.601
  I asked my doctor to recommend
  one, and he gave me this card.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.236
          No way. No.           
      No, no, no, no, no.       

05:37.303 --> 05:38.537
We-We're not seeing any doctors.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.805
                    But, Sam,   

05:39.873 --> 05:41.540
    it's not working.           
     I think that it's time     

05:41.608 --> 05:43.075
          that we have          
    to face the possibility     

05:43.143 --> 05:44.410
  that there's something wrong  
        with you.               

05:47.080 --> 05:48.847
You...                          

05:48.915 --> 05:50.849
            You know            
why we're not conceiving?       

05:50.950 --> 05:52.985
     You're too mean to me.     

05:53.053 --> 05:54.253
    No, I'm not mean.           

05:54.320 --> 05:55.754
      I'm perfectly nice.       

05:55.822 --> 05:58.123
          I just think          
  you're shooting blanks, pal.  

05:58.191 --> 06:00.025
See, there you go again.        

06:00.093 --> 06:01.427
That's mean.                    

06:01.494 --> 06:03.562
              Oh, I'm sorry, I'm
        sorry. Maybe that is.   

06:03.630 --> 06:05.130
                 Maybe I've been
            pushing too hard.   

06:05.198 --> 06:06.298
            It's just that...   

06:06.366 --> 06:07.900
  God, I want this baby so bad  
        that every time         

06:07.967 --> 06:10.002
  I find out I'm not pregnant,  
        I just go crazy.        

06:10.070 --> 06:11.637
                    Let's not   

06:11.705 --> 06:13.305
  talk about it anymore, okay?  

06:13.373 --> 06:14.606
                     Here, just,
                  take the card,

06:14.674 --> 06:16.709
         and if you want to call
        the doctor, that's fine.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.811
        And if you don't, that's
        fine, too. I mean it.   

06:18.878 --> 06:20.546
            I'm really sorry.   

06:20.613 --> 06:23.982
     The last thing in the world
    I wanted to do was hurt you.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.984
        Thank you.              

06:27.754 --> 06:30.689
I can't make this call.         

06:30.757 --> 06:33.192
              Your fingers don't
                work, either?   

06:41.067 --> 06:42.935
CARLA:                          
This will get you.              

06:43.003 --> 06:47.506
 How about losing your balance  
  in a sewage treatment plant?  

06:52.045 --> 06:54.313
All right, all right,           
all right, here it is.          

06:54.381 --> 06:56.281
How about eating food           

06:56.349 --> 06:58.317
recovered from an autopsy?      

06:58.385 --> 06:59.485
                        (laughs)

07:02.789 --> 07:04.256
WOODY:                          
All right, I got one.           

07:04.324 --> 07:06.592
How about                       

07:06.659 --> 07:09.495
someone coming in from the field
who's been working all day,     

07:09.562 --> 07:11.630
while you're sitting down       
at the dinner table,            

07:11.698 --> 07:13.232
and they got no shirt on,       

07:13.299 --> 07:16.101
and their chest hair's          
all matted down?                

07:16.169 --> 07:18.404
                 (stifled laugh)

07:18.471 --> 07:19.805
                (Norm laughs)   

07:19.873 --> 07:21.173
                  That's kind of
              unpleasant, Woody,

07:21.241 --> 07:22.541
                    but it's not
                really gross.   

07:22.609 --> 07:24.443
Well, that's 'cause             
you never met Grandma.          

07:30.717 --> 07:31.917
    Yeah!                       
                    Hey!        

07:31.985 --> 07:33.419
                          CLIFF:
                        Oh, hey!
                      All right!

07:33.486 --> 07:37.856
    Uh, Wood, you want to put   
         a head on that, please?

07:39.559 --> 07:40.893
All right, Frasier,             

07:40.960 --> 07:42.928
let's move on                   
to the living will.             

07:42.996 --> 07:45.197
Imagine you've been             
hideously mangled               

07:45.265 --> 07:48.500
and are being kept alive        
by a respirator.                

07:48.568 --> 07:50.369
          Factoring in          
     the enormous expense,      

07:50.437 --> 07:52.304
the uncertainty, the heartbreak,

07:52.372 --> 07:54.740
    do you really want          
 to be kept alive artificially, 

07:54.808 --> 07:56.308
     or can I pull the plug     

07:56.376 --> 07:58.444
    when the nurse ducks out    
        for a cigarette?        

07:59.546 --> 08:01.880
                By all means,   
                  pull the plug.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.349
                 Smother me with
                     the pillow.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.850
            Save time, woman.   

08:04.918 --> 08:06.719
             Why don't you do it
      tonight while I'm asleep?!

08:09.189 --> 08:10.489
         Well, I guess          

08:10.557 --> 08:12.491
      I can't talk to him       
        about anything.         

08:13.893 --> 08:17.062
So, where did the two musketeers
      go without me today?      

08:17.130 --> 08:19.031
                Well, we went   
                hang gliding.   

08:19.099 --> 08:20.299
                    Then we, uh,

08:20.367 --> 08:22.101
         had lunch with the Miss
        Massachusetts finalists.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.203
             And then, we got to
    drive a fire truck around   

08:24.270 --> 08:25.404
             for a couple hours.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.705
                It was great.   

08:26.773 --> 08:30.109
        You're kidding!         
  Why didn't you ask me along?  

08:30.176 --> 08:31.510
                    Yes, we are 
                  kidding, Paul.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.011
          We went to McDonald's.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.280
What?! You went to McDonald's?! 

08:36.316 --> 08:38.717
      Woody, where's Sam?       

08:38.784 --> 08:40.184
"Woody, where's Norm and Cliff?"

08:40.320 --> 08:41.653
     "Woody, where's Sam?"      

08:41.721 --> 08:43.188
        Now I know              
    how Mr. Krapence feels.     

08:43.256 --> 08:47.192
 How come no one ever walks in  
    and asks me where I am?     

08:47.260 --> 08:49.461
     Woody, where are you?      

08:49.529 --> 08:50.763
    Don't ask me now.           

08:50.830 --> 08:52.431
  Ask me when I'm not around.   

08:57.137 --> 09:00.205
I went to the doctor,           
and I had an examination.       

09:00.273 --> 09:01.607
            Well, what happened?
I don't know yet.               

09:01.675 --> 09:03.008
They're gonna call me           
with the results.               

09:03.076 --> 09:04.910
I want you to know              
that no matter what happens,    

09:04.978 --> 09:06.078
we're in this together.         

09:06.146 --> 09:08.080
There'll be no finger-pointing, 
no blaming.                     

09:08.148 --> 09:10.516
And if there is a problem,      
we'll work through it.          

09:10.583 --> 09:12.584
                        Yeah.   
Because we both                 
want the same thing.            

09:12.652 --> 09:13.786
         Oh, more than anything.

09:13.853 --> 09:14.953
We just want                    
a little baby.                  
                    Yeah.       

09:15.021 --> 09:16.021
                    Oh, God.    
              Oh.               

09:16.089 --> 09:17.289
         (phone rings)          

09:17.357 --> 09:19.324
                     You know...
Give me a second.               

09:19.392 --> 09:20.392
    Hello.                      

09:20.460 --> 09:21.960
Uh-huh, this is she.            

09:22.028 --> 09:23.562
Oh. I just...                   
         Oh, really?            

09:23.630 --> 09:25.130
        You sure?               

09:25.198 --> 09:27.399
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.        

09:27.467 --> 09:29.068
(sighs)                         

09:29.135 --> 09:30.202
        All right!              

09:30.270 --> 09:31.370
          It's not me!          

09:31.438 --> 09:32.604
        It must be you!         

09:33.907 --> 09:36.241
You're the one!                 

09:36.309 --> 09:37.443
        Frasier, focus.         

09:37.510 --> 09:38.944
If we're going                  
to make a will,                 

09:39.012 --> 09:41.447
we have to get                  
these questions worked out.     

09:41.514 --> 09:43.816
            I just don't want to
            talk about my death.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.818
And-or dismemberment.           

09:48.054 --> 09:49.722
                    You know,   

09:49.789 --> 09:50.989
        I don't see us lingering

09:51.057 --> 09:52.558
            over the question   
                  of your death.

09:52.625 --> 09:53.792
     Well, that's because,      

09:53.860 --> 09:55.761
    statistically-speaking,     
    I'll outlive you.           

09:55.829 --> 09:57.663
      Well, I'll just bet you're
    looking forward to that--   

09:57.731 --> 09:59.631
    being the "Widder Crane."   

09:59.699 --> 10:01.567
        Frasier, really.        

10:01.634 --> 10:02.868
                You know, first,

10:02.936 --> 10:04.970
            you get me to get   
                 this $1 million

10:05.038 --> 10:06.138
          life insurance policy.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.007
            Now you're badgering
              me about the will.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.876
  Lilith, I'm practically afraid
 to start my car in the morning.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.278
Frasier, I'm a scientist.       

10:13.346 --> 10:16.248
    If I wanted to kill you,    
    I could certainly think     

10:16.316 --> 10:18.617
  of more clever ways to do it  
        than that.              

10:18.685 --> 10:20.819
Something subtle.               

10:20.887 --> 10:23.889
    Something that couldn't     
     be traced back to me.      

10:23.957 --> 10:25.958
Drink your drink, darling.      

10:27.827 --> 10:30.362
        You are so cute         
  when you fear for your life.  

10:31.898 --> 10:33.699
            You know, Lilith,   
                all this talk   

10:33.767 --> 10:36.301
            of wills and dying--

10:36.369 --> 10:39.571
well, I've just never been so   
    depressed in all my life.   

10:39.639 --> 10:41.774
    Frasier, everyone dies.     

10:41.841 --> 10:43.542
     We have to face that.      

10:43.610 --> 10:45.177
I'm going to die, too.          

10:45.245 --> 10:47.246
             Again?             

10:50.250 --> 10:52.217
Some people are just            
a bunch of babies               

10:52.318 --> 10:53.552
about making out a will.        

10:53.620 --> 10:54.720
                    Think so?   

10:54.788 --> 10:56.221
Yeah. Oh, sure,                 
I think so.                     

10:56.289 --> 10:58.457
I mean, as far                  
as I'm concerned, it's a...     

10:58.525 --> 11:00.492
it's-it's your duty             
as a mature adult.              

11:00.560 --> 11:02.761
    You got to prepare          
 for the inevitable there now.  

11:02.829 --> 11:03.896
  So you took care of it, huh?  

11:03.963 --> 11:05.531
    Oh, yeah, yeah, you bet.    

11:05.598 --> 11:07.666
    Anything happens to me,     
     everything goes to Ma.     

11:07.734 --> 11:09.435
 What happens if Ma goes first? 

11:09.502 --> 11:10.903
Shut up!                        

11:11.071 --> 11:12.638
Shut up, Peterson!              

11:12.706 --> 11:14.873
            Shut up,            
  the whole sick bunch of you!  

11:16.810 --> 11:19.745
         Why should I have to go
          to a fertility doctor?

11:19.813 --> 11:21.880
          And I don't want to go
          to a fertility doctor.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.716
Sammy.                          

11:23.783 --> 11:25.284
                    I hate going
                     to doctors,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.920
            especially fertility
                        doctors.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.356
Sammy, why don't                
you just go?                    

11:30.423 --> 11:33.225
                Why should I?   

11:33.293 --> 11:35.594
The whole idea that I have      
 a problem is just ridiculous.  

11:35.662 --> 11:37.162
Oh, yeah?                       

11:37.230 --> 11:41.200
You've been with thousands      
of women over the years, right? 

11:41.267 --> 11:42.601
                Yeah. Right.    

11:42.669 --> 11:46.171
Well, how many cards do you get 
        on Father's Day?        

11:49.175 --> 11:52.244
    Well, you know...           
  that doesn't mean anything.   

11:52.312 --> 11:55.314
    Sammy, sooner or later,     
you're gonna have to face       

11:55.382 --> 11:58.117
     the possibility that,      
  whether you like it or not,   

11:58.184 --> 12:02.321
    you might just possibly     
    have a low sperm count.     

12:02.389 --> 12:04.523
             You're fired.      
            Get out of here.    

12:04.591 --> 12:05.924
        Go on-- right now.      
             You're fired.      

12:05.992 --> 12:07.126
    Don't turn on me.           

12:07.193 --> 12:08.327
        I'm not the one         
    with the problem.           

12:08.395 --> 12:11.263
    I do not have a problem!    

12:11.331 --> 12:13.565
 I have just as much firepower  
as the next guy, I'll tell you. 

12:13.633 --> 12:16.268
      You think I'm afraid to go
      to that doctor, don't you?

12:16.336 --> 12:17.803
            Well, watch this.   

12:17.871 --> 12:20.072
            I'm gonna go to that
        stupid fertility doctor.

12:20.140 --> 12:24.109
  You know, I bet my fertility  
 just soars right off the map.  

12:25.612 --> 12:28.580
        I'll bet I break        
     their stupid machine.      

12:28.648 --> 12:31.884
     Oh, y-you don't think      
  they use a machine, do you?   

12:54.741 --> 12:56.275
                 Can I help you?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.716
                     Do you have
                 an appointment?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.351
No. No. Uh...                   

13:05.418 --> 13:06.852
I was just, uh, in the building.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.787
     I thought I'd stop by      
          and say hi.           

13:08.855 --> 13:10.923
              Hi.               

13:10.990 --> 13:12.358
(chuckles)                      

13:12.425 --> 13:16.962
Actually, I-I'm here            
for a cleaning.                 

13:18.064 --> 13:19.365
  This is a fertility clinic.   

13:19.432 --> 13:22.601
        What, precisely,        
  would you like us to clean?   

13:25.405 --> 13:26.872
Oh, this...                     
this is embarrassing.           

13:26.940 --> 13:30.476
I'm sorry. I thought this       
was a dentist... I-I'm s...     

13:30.543 --> 13:32.378
  You know something, though,   
        you know, uh...         

13:34.214 --> 13:36.181
While I'm here, you know,       
I have-I have this friend       

13:36.249 --> 13:37.416
who's got a problem,            

13:37.484 --> 13:39.184
and maybe you could do him      
            a favor,            

13:39.252 --> 13:40.452
    and-and write him           
          a note, huh?          

13:40.520 --> 13:41.653
          Saying what?          

13:41.721 --> 13:43.055
 Oh, it doesn't really matter.  

13:43.123 --> 13:45.891
  Just, uh, well you know, uh,  
  "To whom it may concern..."   

13:45.959 --> 13:48.927
    uh, "Sam Malone,"           
  that-that's my friend, uh...  

13:48.995 --> 13:52.064
"Sam Malone has a very,         
very high sperm count.          

13:52.132 --> 13:54.566
Go ahead and have plenty        
of sex with him."               

13:56.202 --> 13:58.704
Maybe, you know, sign it        
down here at the bottom.        

13:58.772 --> 14:00.739
If you want to, you know,       
    put that into, uh,          

14:00.840 --> 14:02.975
 medical terms, that'd be cool. 

14:03.043 --> 14:05.544
        I can't do that.        

14:05.612 --> 14:08.414
     There's 30 bucks in it     
    for you if you do.          

14:08.481 --> 14:10.215
 You're Sam Malone, aren't you? 

14:12.252 --> 14:14.787
Yeah. How'd you know?           

14:14.854 --> 14:17.756
                Believe me, this
        happens all the time.   

14:17.824 --> 14:18.957
The doctor has an opening.      

14:19.025 --> 14:20.192
Would you like to see him?      

14:21.695 --> 14:22.995
        Yeah. All right.        

14:23.063 --> 14:24.663
Yeah. Whatever.                 

14:27.734 --> 14:29.735
                Listen, uh...   

14:29.803 --> 14:33.238
            you really don't use
              a machine, do you?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.047
                 Can I help you?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.817
     Uh. no, no. I just...      

14:44.884 --> 14:46.885
 wanted to stop in and say hi.  

14:52.459 --> 14:54.426
    According to the tests,     
        the doctor says         

14:54.494 --> 14:57.296
      that I am as fertile      
     as an Iowa cornfield.      

14:58.598 --> 15:01.400
Fully stocked ovaries,          

15:01.468 --> 15:05.304
fallopian tubes                 
like fire hoses.                

15:05.372 --> 15:07.406
      How you doing, Norm?      
                 Still drinking.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.678
 Hey, what have you got there,  
          Mr. Clavin?           

15:12.746 --> 15:13.846
     Uh, cake and a pizza.      

15:13.913 --> 15:15.214
      I was thinking about      

15:15.281 --> 15:16.715
    how we keep leaving Paul    
         out of stuff.          

15:16.783 --> 15:19.251
So I thought, why not throw him 
        a little party.         

15:19.319 --> 15:21.887
    Oh, what a sweet,           
  generous thing to do, Cliff.  

15:21.955 --> 15:23.689
Yeah, yeah.                     
Yeah, well thanks.              

15:23.757 --> 15:26.525
I remember, uh, how lonely      
and left out I felt             

15:26.593 --> 15:28.594
till you guys threw me          
that big party.                 

15:28.661 --> 15:30.062
                  We never threw
                    you a party.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.865
No kidding.                     

15:34.100 --> 15:35.768
                  Anyway, Paul's
                    not here.   

15:35.835 --> 15:38.237
     Oh, yeah, no, I know.      
  I, uh, I called him at home,  

15:38.304 --> 15:40.272
and I told him to get down here 
    as soon as he can.          

15:40.340 --> 15:41.373
He said he was just             
getting out of the tub          

15:41.441 --> 15:44.243
and he was toweling             
himself off.                    

15:49.516 --> 15:52.451
We have a winner!               

15:57.190 --> 16:00.125
              So, you got a, uh,
            pizza there, huh?   

16:00.193 --> 16:01.794
Yeah. Yeah.                     
It's pizza.                     

16:01.861 --> 16:04.029
             Yeah. Paul's really
            going to enjoy that.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.632
Yeah...                         
                  When's he, uh,
    supposed to be coming by?   

16:06.700 --> 16:08.400
Couple minutes.                 
                 Couple minutes.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.802
Couple minutes.                 

16:11.304 --> 16:12.738
                     That's, uh,
                 pepperoni, huh?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.106
You betcha.                     

16:14.174 --> 16:16.175
                    Now, did you
                 mention to Paul

16:16.242 --> 16:18.911
              that we had a cake
                    and a pizza?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.380
No. No, no, I didn't.           

16:21.448 --> 16:23.248
            So, uh, you know,   
         we still have the cake.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.050
            Uh, I mean, if there
            wasn't any pizza,   

16:25.118 --> 16:28.053
 Paul wouldn't <i>know</i> there wasn't
        even gonna be any pizza.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.122
Exactly.                        

16:30.190 --> 16:31.924
                      (chuckles)

16:38.098 --> 16:40.265
        What kind of cake is it?

16:44.637 --> 16:47.139
It's, uh... angel food.         

16:47.207 --> 16:48.741
                    This is bad.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.377
             This is really bad.
Why?                            

16:51.444 --> 16:53.178
    We should take that cake,   
            put it in the office

16:53.246 --> 16:55.014
            where it won't be   
              such a temptation.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.181
Good idea.                      
                    Yeah.       

16:56.249 --> 16:57.549
Out of sight,                   
out of mind, huh?               

17:03.456 --> 17:05.891
    We're going to eat the cake,
        too, aren't we, Norm?   

17:05.959 --> 17:07.925
        It's gone.              

17:12.999 --> 17:14.967
             Here.              

17:15.035 --> 17:18.270
    The will is signed          
         and witnessed.         

17:18.338 --> 17:19.738
     I hope you're happy, woman.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.374
              I wash my hands of
              the entire affair.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.242
                     I want that
                 thing sealed up

17:24.310 --> 17:25.544
                  and put into a
                  vault until...

17:25.612 --> 17:29.915
Until <i>you're</i> sealed             
and put in a vault?             

17:29.983 --> 17:33.218
      I am just your ball       
    of yarn today, aren't I?    

17:33.286 --> 17:35.721
              I've also given my
              executor the right

17:35.789 --> 17:38.991
             to dispose of a few
              personal effects--

17:39.059 --> 17:40.893
              a few things which
            might give solace   

17:40.960 --> 17:43.262
                    to those who
                 cared about me.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.464
        Carla, what would you   
        like me to leave you?   

17:45.532 --> 17:48.200
                How about a tip,
                for a change?   

17:50.904 --> 17:53.005
  Hey, Woody, Cliff called me   
          and told me           

17:53.073 --> 17:54.606
    that he and Norm wanted     
to see me. Where are they?      

17:54.674 --> 17:56.208
                  Oh, they're in
                     the office.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.010
Say, Woody, how about you?      

17:58.078 --> 17:59.244
      What can I give you?      

17:59.312 --> 18:03.549
        Oh, well, uh...         
    you know those sweaters     

18:03.616 --> 18:05.184
         like that one          
  with the big leaves on them?  

18:05.251 --> 18:06.352
                    Yes.        

18:06.419 --> 18:09.054
      Anything but those.       

18:13.026 --> 18:15.361
Oh, hi, Paul. How are you?      
                            Hey.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.695
You guys wanted to see me?      

18:16.763 --> 18:18.430
                         Uh-huh.
             Yeah.              

18:18.498 --> 18:20.165
         Yeah, we were          
      just talking, uh...       

18:20.233 --> 18:22.167
    We'd like to, you know,     
    apologize for, you know,    

18:22.235 --> 18:23.769
    leaving you out of things   

18:23.837 --> 18:26.205
            and, well, you know,
             that kind of stuff.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.940
Yeah. You know,                 
after all, you've only          

18:28.008 --> 18:29.408
been coming here, what,         
you know, a few weeks?          

18:29.476 --> 18:31.477
        Ten years.              
I've been coming here ten years.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.978
Whatever. Whatever.             

18:33.046 --> 18:34.013
         Anyway, uh...          

18:34.080 --> 18:36.148
we just feel                    
like we want to--               

18:36.216 --> 18:37.449
oh, thanks, Woody--             

18:37.517 --> 18:39.151
          just feel like we want
        to make it up to you.   

18:39.219 --> 18:40.819
                What we're going
                    to do, Paul,

18:40.887 --> 18:43.222
              we're going to buy
                you a free beer.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.758
Yeah! Woody, right to the brim  
for Uncle Paul, huh?            

18:45.825 --> 18:46.992
                There you go.   

18:47.060 --> 18:48.827
            Wow. I... I can't   
                believe this,   

18:48.895 --> 18:50.195
you know?                       
Thanks, guys.                   

18:50.263 --> 18:51.764
It's a really                   
nice thing to do.               

18:51.831 --> 18:52.898
Really made                     
me feel special.                

18:52.966 --> 18:54.800
Don't mention it,               
Paul.                           
                          Yep.  

18:56.569 --> 18:58.937
     You guys ate my cake,      
          didn't you?           

18:59.005 --> 19:00.472
Yes, we did, Paul.              

19:06.913 --> 19:09.181
        You know,               

19:09.249 --> 19:13.052
writing this will               
has forced me                   

19:13.119 --> 19:15.187
to take a good,                 
long look at my life--          

19:15.255 --> 19:17.523
who I've been,                  

19:17.590 --> 19:20.059
        who I've become.        

19:20.126 --> 19:23.529
         As I tally up          
  the ledger of my... my life,  

19:23.596 --> 19:27.966
    I... I come to one          
    unmistakable conclusion.    

19:30.503 --> 19:33.939
 I have tipped you adequately.  

19:37.577 --> 19:41.680
         More, in fact,         
    than you have deserved.     

19:41.748 --> 19:43.115
                        Frasier,
                 I called a cab.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.883
        Go clean yourself up.   

19:44.951 --> 19:46.518
        Okay.                   

19:49.255 --> 19:52.191
You were never courteous.       
          Never once.           

19:56.396 --> 19:58.630
 Sammy, what took you so long?  

20:00.600 --> 20:03.002
I decided to hang around        
and wait for the lab report.    

20:04.504 --> 20:08.040
When I finally got it,          
I was afraid to look at it.     

20:08.108 --> 20:09.375
I've been walking               
around the Common               

20:09.442 --> 20:11.744
hoping someone would            
mug me and steal it.            

20:11.811 --> 20:14.580
        Yeah. Well, those things
                 are really hot.

20:14.647 --> 20:18.784
    I carry a sign in my car:   
    "Driver has no lab results."

20:25.025 --> 20:26.925
     Why don't you go ahead     
        and look at it?         

20:26.993 --> 20:28.627
      Might be good news.       

20:28.695 --> 20:30.562
                  Yeah, it might
                    be bad news.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.164
It might be good news.          

20:32.232 --> 20:33.565
        But what if it's not?   

20:33.633 --> 20:35.501
 Well, you're not going to know 
      unless you open it.       

20:35.568 --> 20:36.702
            I can't.            

20:36.770 --> 20:38.737
                    You open it.

20:38.805 --> 20:41.306
Oh, I couldn't do that.         

20:41.374 --> 20:44.109
I mean, I...I couldn't bear     
to tell you if it was bad news. 

20:44.177 --> 20:45.344
  But what if it's good news?   

20:45.412 --> 20:47.880
     What if it's bad news?     

20:50.116 --> 20:51.517
                  You know, this
                  could turn out

20:51.584 --> 20:54.186
        to be the worst night   
         of my life or the best.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.854
                  And the... the
                 only difference

20:55.922 --> 20:59.692
      is a few lousy words      
      on a piece of paper.      

20:59.759 --> 21:01.894
         Oh, God, you know, this
          is the rest of my life

21:01.961 --> 21:04.396
    we're talking about here.   

21:04.464 --> 21:09.335
I mean, I-I may have a kid      
     to play baseball with.     

21:09.402 --> 21:10.936
         Or I may not.          

21:11.004 --> 21:13.439
              I may have someone
            to carry on my name,

21:13.506 --> 21:15.240
         or I may not.          

21:15.308 --> 21:17.609
        Oh, geez!               

21:17.677 --> 21:19.244
  Boy, it's amazing, you know,  

21:19.312 --> 21:22.014
 how much power a little piece  
    of paper can have.          

21:22.082 --> 21:23.649
      You know, maybe this      
  is just one of those things   

21:23.717 --> 21:24.983
  that people should not know.  

21:27.687 --> 21:29.488
    Sammy?                      
                        Yeah?   

21:29.556 --> 21:31.156
Give me that                    
trash can over there.           

21:32.625 --> 21:34.293
      What are you doing?       

21:34.361 --> 21:36.028
Putting you out                 
of your misery.                 

21:36.096 --> 21:38.297
It was just a little            
too painful to watch.           

21:38.365 --> 21:42.668
      Oh. Hey, thank you.       

21:42.736 --> 21:44.403
              Oh!               

21:44.471 --> 21:46.372
    (flames crackling)          

21:48.008 --> 21:50.809
        Too bad we don't have   
          any marshmallows, huh?

21:50.877 --> 21:51.977
We've got you.                  

21:52.045 --> 21:54.213
    (car horn honking)          

21:54.280 --> 21:56.849
Hey, Fras,                      
your cab's here!                

21:56.916 --> 22:00.319
        Oh, there.              
  I've pulled myself together.  

22:06.226 --> 22:09.194
    Now that I have my will,    
        I suppose I can         

22:09.262 --> 22:11.330
  look into the face of death.  

22:12.665 --> 22:14.900
Just hope I don't wake her.     

22:23.410 --> 22:26.111
I am sorry about the passing    
of your husband, Lilith.        

22:26.179 --> 22:29.348
Frasier was a good man,         
and we will all miss him.       

22:29.416 --> 22:30.749
    Thank you.                  

22:30.817 --> 22:33.719
        Well, I now have        
        the unhappy task        

22:33.787 --> 22:35.187
        of reading your         
      late husband's will.      

22:36.956 --> 22:38.524
            You okay, Mother?   

22:38.591 --> 22:41.026
Yes. Thank you,                 
Frederick.                      

22:41.094 --> 22:45.397
"Sam Malone's sperm count       
 is well within normal range."  

22:45.465 --> 22:49.068
         That damn bar.
