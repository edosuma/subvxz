00:58.358 --> 00:59.192
Thank you.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.395
A most wonderful
evening, William.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.298
Yes, the dance lessons were
worth every penny of the $8.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.132

01:05.132 --> 01:06.333
That's true.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.435
But I was actually referring
to the event itself.

01:08.435 --> 01:09.670
Ah, yes, of course.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.072
I wonder what marvel
Mr. Blake has brought

01:12.072 --> 01:13.073
back from the bone fields.

01:13.073 --> 01:13.707
We shall soon see.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.176
I believe the man
himself has arrived.

01:16.176 --> 01:17.144
Ah!

01:17.144 --> 01:21.148
Who knew dinosaur hunters
would become such celebrities?

01:21.148 --> 01:22.549
Yes, perhaps
someday everyone will

01:22.549 --> 01:24.751
be as fascinated
with pathologists

01:24.751 --> 01:26.153

evening, Barkeley.

for punishment.

Uh, wait, wait-- I--
I'd like a sandwich.

01:44.404 --> 01:47.541
I heard this afternoon of a
new light that can actually

01:47.541 --> 01:49.209
see through solid objects?

01:49.209 --> 01:52.279
Oh, yes, I've heard of this
as well-- Roentgen's rays.

call them, x-rays.

02:09.997 --> 02:14.334
And for the last six years, it
has been my distinct privilege

02:14.334 --> 02:16.236

MARY ANN MCCONNELL: As you are
all aware, eight years ago,

02:25.679 --> 02:28.248
it was Barkeley's
remarkable discovery

02:28.248 --> 02:29.983
of an almost intact theropod--

02:29.983 --> 02:30.617
Remarkably lucky.

MARY ANN MCCONNELL: Well,
tonight, good people,

02:37.157 --> 02:42.295
Mr. Blake will reveal a find

found in all my years

03:11.324 --> 03:15.295

awaited me in a nearby coulee.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.331
What nature had entombed
for millions of years

03:18.331 --> 03:21.735
took me mere days to unearth.

he was placed there

access to the room?

However, he seemed intent
on vandalizing that bone.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.004
And he also seemed
just as surprised

04:31.004 --> 04:32.639
by the murder as everyone else.

Still, we'll need to
have a chat with him.

Yes.

The men are searching
for him now.

And have him check the local
churches, especially the ones

the old fire and brimstone.

telling us anything?

04:53.426 --> 04:55.061
It appears he was shot.

The bullet penetrated
the skull here.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.333
Any gunshot residue?

No.

the time of death?

give you is 24 to 48 hours.

06:14.241 --> 06:17.377
eating, digging, drinking.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.747
He knew his strata like
no one I've ever met.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.415
Did he have any enemies?

06:22.415 --> 06:24.417
None that I know
of, but bone hunting

Why?

06:30.490 --> 06:32.192
Well, the bones are priceless.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.294
There's constant
danger from raiders.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.262
Ah.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.563
And these raiders,
who might they be?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.199
Oh, sometimes
they're just hired

06:39.199 --> 06:41.368

the bones and sell

06:41.368 --> 06:43.670
them to private collectors.

And other times?

No doubt you know of Othniel

The Bone Wars, yes.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.316

06:56.316 --> 06:58.218
They're all true, I assure you.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.620
That pair was
notorious for trying

07:00.620 --> 07:03.490
to destroy one another's
digs, for stealing

07:03.490 --> 07:06.293
one another's fossils.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.762
Their animosity towards each
other was also their downfall.

In some ways, those religious
sorts frighten me the most.

They're completely irrational.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.078
Never.

did you last see him?

07:27.347 --> 07:29.182
Well, that's the
shocking part, Detective.

07:29.182 --> 07:32.118
The last I saw him,
he was in Alberta.

Alberta?

07:32.752 --> 07:33.586
Yes.

07:33.586 --> 07:36.423
He'd stayed behind to supervise
the packing up of the camp.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.526
Do you have any idea why he
would come here to Toronto?

With my schedule, I really

MARY ANN MCCONNELL:
I personally shrouded

07:59.512 --> 08:01.648
the femur and the dinosaur.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.650
Barkeley wanted
secrecy so we could

08:03.650 --> 08:07.354
dramatically reveal the fossil.

08:07.354 --> 08:10.190
Were you the last
person in the hall?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.992
I think so.

08:11.992 --> 08:12.726
It was so late.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.562
I-- I wanted everything
to be perfect.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.464
Could someone have
stayed behind unseen,

08:17.464 --> 08:19.199
or slipped in later?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.166
I suppose it's possible.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.374
And when did you
last see Mr. DeWitt?

08:27.374 --> 08:31.211
Uh, the night before
we left our camp.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.345
We worked together so closely.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.081
I would have thought he'd
tell me if he was coming.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.450
I can't stop working, it seams.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.387
I'm afraid if I do, I--

08:40.387 --> 08:42.589
Miss McConnell, may I?

08:51.197 --> 08:53.166
It's an ungula, yes?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.068
Most people would
call it a claw.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.470
From the Albertosaur,
I believe.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.240
You've studied paleontology.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.410
Well, it's been an obsession
of mine since childhood.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.011
For me, too.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.515
Still is, obviously.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.650
Miss McConnell, I
understand that Mr.

09:10.650 --> 09:14.587
Blake has enemies-- rivals.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.189
Are you suggesting
that they may have done

09:16.189 --> 09:17.757
this to get back at Barkeley?

09:17.757 --> 09:21.194
It's a possibility
that I must explore.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.397
Is there anyone in particular
that comes to mind?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.199
There is one person.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.467
PROFESSOR SUTTON:
Barkeley Blake is

09:27.467 --> 09:30.070
a-- is a gaseous,
bloated mental midget who

09:30.070 --> 09:32.138
just happened to pull the wool
over the scientific world's

09:32.138 --> 09:33.073
eyes.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.976
Clearly, Professor Sutton,
you do not care for Mr. Blake.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.680
No, um, uh, I adore the way
people confuse scientific rigor

09:40.680 --> 09:42.415
with nice teeth.

09:42.415 --> 09:46.219
Perhaps you disliked him so
much that you took action.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.488
You're talking
about Lukas DeWitt.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.556
Good god, man.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.257
If I-- if I had gone
to those lengths,

09:51.257 --> 09:53.493
it would've been Barkeley
caught in those teeth.

09:53.493 --> 09:57.097
Professor, I don't understand
your dislike of Mr. Blake.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.033
Five years ago, Barkeley
Blake was simply a geologist

10:00.033 --> 10:01.000
mapping coal deposits.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.269
He happened to stumble
upon a dinosaur skull,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.472
and now he passes himself
off as a paleontologist.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.574
And everyone laps it up.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.676
But you can't deny
that Mr. Blake has now

10:09.676 --> 10:11.611
made two stunning discoveries.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.013
That is not paleontology.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.582
That is carnival showmanship.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.622
Here, look.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.623
Take that.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.191
That is paleontology.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.293
That is what matters.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.761
It's a fossilized plant.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.130
More than that, Detective.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.332
That is the basis of life.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.166
That is paleontology.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.501
That-- this is what matters.

10:34.501 --> 10:38.071
This is the slow, methodical
exploration of a world

10:38.071 --> 10:38.738
that no longer exists.

10:38.738 --> 10:43.143
Please-- my collection is
very specifically organized.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.344
Thank you.

10:44.344 --> 10:48.615
It is not the hunt
for fame and fortune.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.684
Professor, you're obviously
very passionate about this.

10:51.684 --> 10:54.154
My understanding is
so much so that you'd

10:54.154 --> 10:56.422
be willing to sabotage
Mr. Blake's efforts.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.324
Oh.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.093
Barkeley is portraying
himself as the victim.

11:00.093 --> 11:00.727
I see.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.495
Yes, yes, yes, that's
not surprising.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.998
Do you deny this?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.200
Shipments of my fossils
have been hijacked.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.669
An entire rock face that I
was excavating was dynamited.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.704
Please answer my question, sir.

11:11.704 --> 11:16.509
If there's a war,
I didn't start it.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.378
I'll need to make an
account of your whereabouts

11:18.378 --> 11:19.979
over the past few days.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.080
Well, I was-- I was here.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.215
I was cataloguing.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.616
Alone, I take it?

11:23.616 --> 11:26.052
Well-- well, I don't
have dozens of students

11:26.052 --> 11:27.587
to do my work for
me while I gallivant

11:27.587 --> 11:28.555
with the rich and famous.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.338
GEORGE: What became
of them, sir?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.272
George.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.107
What became of whom?

11:48.107 --> 11:50.443
The dinosaurs.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.011
Well, their
extinction remains one

11:52.011 --> 11:53.213
of the world's great mysteries.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.548
You know, I heard tales
that they still exist,

11:55.548 --> 11:57.350
that they're hidden in
the unexplored headwaters

11:57.350 --> 11:59.452
of the Congo and the Amazon.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.020
That's bollocks.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.188
If they're anywhere,
they're probably

12:02.188 --> 12:05.358
in the Highlands of Scotland,
possibly in Loch Ness.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.260
Oh, yes, Loch Ness.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.395
"The Loch Ness Dinosaur."

12:09.395 --> 12:12.632
That's got a bit
of a ring to it.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.767
I've put a request into the
North-West Mounted Police.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.669
Someone's going to ride
out to Blake's dig site

12:16.669 --> 12:19.405
and see if anyone left there can
tell us what DeWitt was up to.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.174
That could take some time.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.575
George, what do you have for me?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.410
Well, I looked into Mr.
DeWitt's personal life.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.013
Apparently he was quite
liked by all his chums.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.181
He also told them
that he recently

12:28.181 --> 12:31.384
became sweet on somebody,
but he hadn't said who.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.652
We'll need to have
a word with her.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.987
I'll track her down.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.488
We're also looking
into all the alibis

12:35.488 --> 12:39.025
of anybody who had access to the
exhibit, but it's a long list.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.627
What about the young
man with the hammer?

12:40.627 --> 12:42.195
We've checked with
various church groups,

12:42.195 --> 12:44.130
and nothing so far.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.498
Mr. DeWitt arrived by train.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.066
Have we checked
with Union Station?

12:47.066 --> 12:49.269
We have, and there's no
record of a Lukas DeWitt

12:49.269 --> 12:51.237
traveling by sleeper class.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.739
He could have traveled coach.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.073
Bugger that.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.309
No DeWitt is going
to travel coach.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.410
What makes you so sure?

12:57.410 --> 12:58.711
The family stinks of money.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.647
They're American,
from Philadelphia.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.117
Made their fortune in
bedsprings, I believe.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.551
Oh, those DeWitts.

13:05.551 --> 13:08.121
Ah, the bedspring
DeWitts of Philadelphia.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.590
Well, perhaps money
is the motive.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.591
Yes, perhaps.

13:11.591 --> 13:15.028
George, see if Mr. DeWitt's
accounts have been touched.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.596
In the meantime, I
believe Dr. Ogden

13:16.596 --> 13:18.398
has post-mortem results for me.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.399
Yes, Murdoch.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.767
Er, about that.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.139
I can't open the body,
and there's absolutely

13:26.139 --> 13:27.674
nothing I can do about it.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.710
It's signed by
the Chief Coroner.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.579
The DeWitts are sending
an American pathologist?

13:33.579 --> 13:35.682
Apparently I'm not
qualified enough.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.150
The audacity.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.452
Well, this is preposterous.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.689
We need those results to
conduct our investigation.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.691
Well, fortunately,
nothing precluded

13:44.691 --> 13:46.759
me from studying the body.

13:50.596 --> 13:51.431
Plaster.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.298
Yes.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.534
I found traces of it, as well
as these brownish fibers all

13:54.534 --> 13:56.069
over his clothes
and exposed skin.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.410
[HAMMERING]

14:08.981 --> 14:11.017
The fossils from
Mr. Blake's dig

14:11.017 --> 14:15.355
were wrapped in burlap
and plaster for shipping.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.325
Are you suggesting his body
was preserved, like a fossil?

14:19.325 --> 14:22.595
Perhaps a form of
short-term mummification?

14:22.595 --> 14:25.531
The lack of oxygen would
have impeded the natural decay

14:25.531 --> 14:27.333
of the body, explaining why
I've been having trouble

14:27.333 --> 14:28.568
pinpointing the time of death.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.470
But more importantly,
it would suggest

14:30.470 --> 14:32.305
that he was killed
where the fossils

14:32.305 --> 14:34.474
were prepared for shipment.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.710
Mr. Blake's camp in Alberta.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.012
I believe we need to rethink
this entire investigation.

14:48.988 --> 14:49.622
INSP.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.758
BRACKENREID: You're suggesting
that someone shot DeWitt

14:51.758 --> 14:54.694
in Alberta, plastered
his body in Alberta,

14:54.694 --> 14:57.663
transported it on a
train from Alberta,

14:57.663 --> 15:00.433
and placed it in a
dinosaur's jaws in Toronto.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.535
Yes, sir.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.370
Excellent theory, Murdoch.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.506
Sounds entirely plausible to me.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.574
Sir, it would explain
why we have no record

15:08.574 --> 15:10.209
of him arriving in Toronto.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.077
Hmm.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.016
I did hear back from the
North-West Mounted Police,

15:17.016 --> 15:19.419
and apparently DeWitt
vanished from the camp the day

15:19.419 --> 15:21.354
that the bones were shipped.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.290
Someone wants us to think
that he was murdered here.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.125
Not in Alberta.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.728
So who would have the means
to do something like this?

15:28.728 --> 15:31.364
Anyone who prepared fossils
for shipment in Alberta

15:31.364 --> 15:33.332
would have both the
knowledge and access

15:33.332 --> 15:35.535
to necessary equipment.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.469
Exactly.

15:36.469 --> 15:40.506
Then we're looking for someone
from Blake's camp, aren't we?

15:40.506 --> 15:43.509
George, I'd like you to find
Mr. DeWitt's field journals.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.377
Of course.
DET.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.545
MURDOCH: Please
review them and tell

15:45.545 --> 15:48.281
me precisely what Mr. DeWitt
was working on at the dig.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.682
He was killed for a
reason, and perhaps

15:49.682 --> 15:51.150
they can tell us what it is.

15:51.150 --> 15:54.053
Right away, sir.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.189
He was packed with the fossils?

15:58.658 --> 15:59.992
How monstrous.

15:59.992 --> 16:00.660
DET.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.462
MURDOCH: Indeed.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.631
But what I find perplexing
is that a bone that large

16:05.631 --> 16:07.767
went by unnoticed.

16:07.767 --> 16:12.138
It must've been at least
six feet in length.

16:12.138 --> 16:15.107
Well, as you can see, we--
we do have many specimens,

16:15.107 --> 16:18.444
and we ship many larger pieces.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.079
But I'll speak
with my assistants

16:20.079 --> 16:21.681
and see if they saw anything.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.250
I would appreciate that.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.220
I see you're packing
the Terrasaurus femur.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.521
Have you another exhibition?

16:28.521 --> 16:31.457
No, actually, it's been
sold to the American

16:31.457 --> 16:33.392
Museum of Natural History.

16:33.392 --> 16:34.227
Oh.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.095
Not a Canadian institution?

16:36.095 --> 16:37.563
I find that surprising.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.333
Well, only the Americans
could afford the expense--

16:40.333 --> 16:43.069
and the size, fortunately.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.203
Fortunately?

16:44.203 --> 16:46.205
Otherwise it would end
up in private hands.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.473
And I believe that
would be a shame.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.510
Ah, I agree.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.447
However, you seem to have
procured a fossil for yourself.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.516
An ammonite, I believe?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.484
Yes.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.019
W-well, they are plentiful.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.487
And, uh, it has significance.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.525
Lukas DeWitt had a sweetheart.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.564
It was you, wasn't it?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.566
Yes.

17:13.566 --> 17:18.304
He gave it to me, that
last night at the camp,

17:18.304 --> 17:22.141
to help remember him
while we were apart.

17:22.141 --> 17:26.045
Why didn't you tell me
of your relationship?

17:26.045 --> 17:30.583
I suppose I didn't want to
be perceived as anyone's gal.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.685
Miss McConnell,
that hardly seems

17:32.685 --> 17:34.420
a viable reason not to tell me.

17:34.420 --> 17:38.391
Detective, it's very difficult
to be a female paleontologist.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.128
And one who does
fieldwork is unheard of.

17:42.128 --> 17:43.429
Oh, it's no use.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.364
You would never understand.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.166
I think I do.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.668
You wanted to be respected.

17:48.668 --> 17:52.505
Just to be taken
seriously for my abilities.

17:52.505 --> 17:56.576
But I would never,
never harm Lukas.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.345
He gave me that respect.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.580
Tsk.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.082
Unlike some others.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.251
Others?

18:05.251 --> 18:06.586
Barkeley.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.422
A serious misstep in
my personal history.

18:09.422 --> 18:13.526
And did Mr. Blake know of
your involvement with Lukas?

18:13.526 --> 18:15.227
He did.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.063
Made things terribly awkward.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.397
How so?

18:18.397 --> 18:21.233
As you no doubt can imagine,
Barkeley doesn't like

18:21.233 --> 18:23.102
to finish second to anyone.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.038
BARKELEY BLAKE: The
ramblings of a bitter woman.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.407
You deny you were jealous?

18:28.407 --> 18:31.077
Lukas and I had words, but only
because I could see the scope

18:31.077 --> 18:32.979
of things and he couldn't.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.680
The scope?

18:34.680 --> 18:37.316
When you've examined life on
the scale of millions of years,

18:37.316 --> 18:41.454
as I have, you realize that we
are but a brief moment in time.

18:41.454 --> 18:46.158
A woman won or lost
doesn't matter.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.361
Apparently Mr. DeWitt
considered Miss McConnell

18:48.361 --> 18:50.696
more than a moment in time.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.431
Mary Ann is an
excellent assistant,

18:52.431 --> 18:55.334
but her dreams exceed her grasp.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.370
To make a truly
remarkable discovery,

18:57.370 --> 19:01.207
you need an instinct and an
almost preternatural affinity

19:01.207 --> 19:03.009
for the world around you.

19:03.009 --> 19:03.643
I see.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.645
And Miss McConnell
lacks instinct?

19:05.645 --> 19:06.479
She does.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.115
However, her clerical
and organizational skills

19:09.115 --> 19:11.250
are excellent.

19:11.250 --> 19:15.554
Nevertheless, you admit to
having words with the victim?

19:15.554 --> 19:18.024
Yes.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.059
Do you own a gun?

19:20.059 --> 19:20.993
Of course.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.295
There many dangers
out in the Badlands.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.564
So you won't object
to me examining it.

19:25.564 --> 19:28.968
Of course not, but you
will be wasting your time.

19:28.968 --> 19:33.673
Mr. Blake, you do know how to
prepare fossils for transport?

19:33.673 --> 19:37.677
Really, Detective, of
course I know how to.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.679
And yes, I could have
done that to Lukas,

19:39.679 --> 19:41.447
but so could anyone
at our camp--

19:41.447 --> 19:43.716
or, for that matter, Sutton's.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.017
Rudolph Sutton?

19:45.017 --> 19:45.651
He was there?

19:45.651 --> 19:48.521
He was always digging near
my expeditions-- I'm sure,

19:48.521 --> 19:50.589
in part, to provoke me, but
really it's because he's

19:50.589 --> 19:54.060
totally lacking in imagination.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.728
And where was
his camp, exactly?

19:55.728 --> 19:59.665
Few miles from us in the
Red Deer River Valley.

19:59.665 --> 20:03.102
He was digging up
Magnoliopsidas.

20:03.102 --> 20:03.736
RUDOLPH SUTTON: Idiot.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.670
The man is an idiot.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.372
Magnoliopsida?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.373
No, no, no, no, no.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.609
It's Nielsonia.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.480
Yeah, from the order
Cicadalles, not Magnoliopsida.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.314
This is-- you see?

20:15.314 --> 20:16.148
This is it.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.451
It's just further proof
of his incompetence.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.220
Professor Sutton, why are
you so adamant that Mr. Blake

20:21.220 --> 20:23.022
is undeserving of respect?

20:23.022 --> 20:24.123
Nothing larger
than a guinea pig

20:24.123 --> 20:26.058
has ever been found at
the Edmonton formation

20:26.058 --> 20:27.126
where he was digging.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.695
Did his-- did his
Terrasaurus burrow

20:29.695 --> 20:31.363
through 200 feet of
cretaceous sediment

20:31.363 --> 20:35.334
before conveniently
expiring for posterity?

20:35.334 --> 20:37.236
And what were you
hoping to find there?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.739
Well, I-- I was nowhere
near the Edmonton formation.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.073
No?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.441
Mr. Blake said that
you were no more

20:42.441 --> 20:44.376
than two miles away from him.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.678
Two-- two miles, yes.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.646
Two miles, but millions
of years, Detective.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.116
I was working the
Scollard formation.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.584
It's as different
as night from day.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.253
But I-- what does this
have to do with anything?

20:54.253 --> 20:58.190
Professor, we know that Lukas
DeWitt was killed in Alberta.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.158
He was shot in the head.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.260
His body was encased
like a fossil.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.129
He was shipped back
here to Toronto,

21:03.129 --> 21:06.766
and then his body was put on
display in the dinosaur's jaws.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.502
Right.

21:09.502 --> 21:12.338
Oh, you think that I could
do something so monstrous?

21:12.338 --> 21:14.240
Well, I'm a man of science.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.008
Do you own a gun, sir?

21:16.008 --> 21:17.143
Yes.

21:17.143 --> 21:20.146
It's for fending off
thieves and coyotes.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.748
I'll need to
perform tests on it.

21:22.748 --> 21:23.749
You're serious.

21:23.749 --> 21:24.583
Most.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.354
[GUNSHOT]
INSP.

21:28.354 --> 21:29.288
BRACKENREID: (FAINTLY) Hey!

21:29.288 --> 21:31.223
Hey!

21:31.223 --> 21:32.591
Bloody hell, Murdoch!

21:32.591 --> 21:34.293
How many times have I
told you about firing

21:34.293 --> 21:35.261
off a gun inside the station?

21:35.261 --> 21:37.563
Just testing out
a new design, sir.

21:37.563 --> 21:40.533
However, I had hoped the blast
would be somewhat more muffled.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.600
What's inside the box?

21:41.600 --> 21:42.601
Cotton, sir, and straw.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.336
What for?

21:44.336 --> 21:46.472
In the past, I've used
water to slow the bullet's

21:46.472 --> 21:48.073
impact when collecting them.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.375
Yes, yes, the rain barrels.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.443
In actual fact,
water is very dense,

21:51.443 --> 21:53.746
and the lead slugs were
being damaged by hitting it.

21:53.746 --> 21:54.713
The cotton's softer.

21:54.713 --> 21:55.548
Precisely.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.250
I'm hoping to preserve as much
evidentiary value as possible.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.151
Ah.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.519
Here it is.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.487
Ah!

22:01.487 --> 22:02.488
Ah!

22:02.488 --> 22:05.024
Ah.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.325
Perfect condition.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.727
Now for Mr. Sutton's gun.

22:08.727 --> 22:11.263
Murdoch, you can fire as
many pistols as you like,

22:11.263 --> 22:12.998
but they won't do you
any good, now will they?

22:12.998 --> 22:13.999
Why is that?

22:13.999 --> 22:16.135
Because you don't have a
bullet to compare them to.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.404
Haven't I?

22:18.404 --> 22:19.705
There were strict
orders prohibiting

22:19.705 --> 22:21.340
that body being touched.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.408
And it wasn't.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.243
Stop talking in riddles.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.645
Sir, Mr. DeWitt's body
has not been touched.

22:26.645 --> 22:30.049
However, I do have the means
to examine that bullet.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.451
And how do you plan on
doing that, me old mucker?

22:32.451 --> 22:34.386
[SWITCHES FLIPPING]

22:37.356 --> 22:38.991
Radiography?

22:38.991 --> 22:40.292
That's it, sir.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.428
And this enables you
to see through things?

22:42.428 --> 22:43.262
Yes.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.563
Amazing, isn't it?

22:44.563 --> 22:46.065
BRACKENREID: But how
is that possible?

22:46.065 --> 22:47.132
X-rays

22:47.132 --> 22:47.766
X-rays?

22:47.766 --> 22:49.368
So named by their
discoverer, Dr.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.438
Roentgen, who didn't know what
they were, "x-actly." [LAUGHS]

22:55.741 --> 22:58.043
In actual fact,
they are light rays,

22:58.043 --> 23:00.179
only made of magnetic energy.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.715
And these rays are able
to penetrate and pass

23:02.715 --> 23:04.617
through matter, allowing
them to be captured

23:04.617 --> 23:06.185
on this photographic plate.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.487
Now, since all objects
have different densities--

23:08.487 --> 23:10.623
Murdoch, I'll take
your word for it.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.726
Where did you happen to
find this contraption?

23:13.726 --> 23:14.560
Oh.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.198
Well, I may have borrowed
it from the hospital.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.967
I like your initiative, Doctor.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.435
Can you hold this, Inspector?

23:23.435 --> 23:25.204
Of course.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.171
Like this?

23:26.171 --> 23:27.006
Yes.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.410
Now the gun is in position.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.278
You may fire when ready.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.112

23:39.018 --> 23:39.752
Oh my.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.586
Well, did it work?

23:40.586 --> 23:41.587
See for yourself, sir.

23:45.457 --> 23:46.592
Bloody hell.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.593
It's the man's skull.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.595
It's miraculous, isn't it?

23:49.595 --> 23:51.030
And the bullet entered here?

23:51.030 --> 23:51.664
Yes.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.232
And metal is revealed by this?

23:53.232 --> 23:55.301
Exactly.

23:55.301 --> 23:58.504
Then unless I'm not even more
confused than I think I am,

23:58.504 --> 23:59.571
shouldn't I be seeing a bullet?

23:59.571 --> 24:00.439
What?

24:04.176 --> 24:05.611
It seems our
bullet has vanished.

24:09.348 --> 24:11.383
A bullet doesn't
simply disappear

24:11.383 --> 24:13.719
from inside of a man's skull.

24:13.719 --> 24:16.588
You sure this x-ray contraption
really works, Doctor?

24:16.588 --> 24:17.489
I'm certain of it.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.725
I tested it several times.

24:19.725 --> 24:22.227
Then where did the bullet go?

24:22.227 --> 24:23.329
It was never there.

24:23.329 --> 24:26.332
Then how did the
bullet hole get there?

24:26.332 --> 24:30.035
Something penetrated the
skull, but it wasn't a bullet.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.204
It simply created an
entrance wound similar to what

24:32.204 --> 24:33.105
a bullet would have.

24:33.105 --> 24:36.375
So what kind of weapon
are we looking for?

24:36.375 --> 24:38.277
May I see the radiograph again?

24:41.146 --> 24:43.415
Whatever it was, it must
have been fairly sharp.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.017
To puncture the skull.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.752
Yeah, not shatter
it completely.

24:46.752 --> 24:47.619
Precisely.

24:47.619 --> 24:51.223
I wonder what this area is.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.291
Some brain tissue?

24:52.291 --> 24:53.692
A tumor, perhaps?

24:53.692 --> 24:55.060
Fragments of the skull?

24:55.060 --> 24:58.330
No, I see those.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.432
Could it be debris
left behind by whatever

25:00.432 --> 25:02.968
penetrated the skull?

25:02.968 --> 25:05.137
That's what I'm wondering.

25:05.137 --> 25:10.209
I could possibly retrieve
a sample through the wound.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.045
That wouldn't really
constitute opening up the body,

25:13.045 --> 25:15.280
now would it?

25:15.280 --> 25:16.548
I wouldn't think so, no.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.487
What have we here?

25:21.487 --> 25:24.556
It's clumped, but
it seems granular.

25:24.556 --> 25:27.459
Could it be more plaster from
when the body was wrapped?

25:27.459 --> 25:29.194
No, it's too
coarse for plaster.

25:29.194 --> 25:33.132
I believe it's
soil of some sort.

25:33.132 --> 25:37.069
I suppose it could have entered
the wound when our victim fell.

25:37.069 --> 25:37.703
William?

25:52.151 --> 25:54.119
A pick.

25:54.119 --> 25:57.256
Could it have been
a geologist's pick?

25:57.256 --> 26:01.260
Well, I suppose-- well, that
would have made a hole the size

26:01.260 --> 26:02.628
and shape of the wound.

26:02.628 --> 26:06.131
And it would account
for the debris.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.633
Geology pick.

26:07.633 --> 26:10.969
Always struck me as such an
innocent, hopeful little tool.

26:10.969 --> 26:13.605
Everyone at that site would
have had access to one.

26:13.605 --> 26:14.473
Yes, of course.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.575
Most unfortunate for
your investigation.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.244
Do you have any idea
what kind of soil this is?

26:19.244 --> 26:20.312
I don't know.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.513
Limestone, perhaps?

26:21.513 --> 26:23.282
What are you thinking?

26:23.282 --> 26:25.384
Blake and Sutton were working
in different sedimentary

26:25.384 --> 26:28.220
layers, each layer with
its own unique composition.

26:28.220 --> 26:31.123
So if you could determine
which layer the soil came from,

26:31.123 --> 26:32.357
you'd have your killer.

26:32.357 --> 26:35.527
At the very least, I'd know
which camp it came from.

26:35.527 --> 26:36.662
I have an associate
in the geology

26:36.662 --> 26:37.996
department at the university.

26:37.996 --> 26:41.266
I could have a sample sent over.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.101
[KNOCK]

26:42.101 --> 26:42.734
Sir?

26:42.734 --> 26:44.103
Yes, George, come in.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.371
GEORGE: What are
you looking at, sir?

26:46.371 --> 26:50.642
Oh, it's a geological map
of the Alberta Badlands.

26:50.642 --> 26:55.080
Mr. Blake was working here
in the Edmonton formation,

26:55.080 --> 26:57.583
Mr. Sutton in the
Scollard Formation,

26:57.583 --> 26:59.151
right here, further
down by the river.

26:59.151 --> 27:02.221
Sir, what exactly do
they mean by formation?

27:02.221 --> 27:04.556
Well, they're layers
of rock created

27:04.556 --> 27:09.194
by sediment deposited over
millions and millions of years.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.729
Millions of years ago.

27:10.729 --> 27:13.432
Boggles the mind just to think
about it, doesn't it, sir?

27:13.432 --> 27:14.433
Certainly does.

27:14.433 --> 27:17.503
I mean, my aunt believes that
the world is 6,000 years old--

27:17.503 --> 27:18.704
based on the Bible, of course.

27:18.704 --> 27:21.206
Well, she would
be a literalist.

27:21.206 --> 27:23.609
Much like the young man with
the hammer, I would suspect.

27:23.609 --> 27:26.178
Their views bring them into
direct conflict with men

27:26.178 --> 27:27.613
like Sutton and
Blake who believe

27:27.613 --> 27:29.681
in the evolutionary
development of the world.

27:29.681 --> 27:30.682
Mm.

27:30.682 --> 27:32.651
She believes that the
world was made in six days,

27:32.651 --> 27:33.519
and that's the end of it.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.522
Myself, I take a bit more
of a scientific perspective.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.623
Oh?

27:37.623 --> 27:39.525
I do, but I don't think
the two schools of thought

27:39.525 --> 27:40.392
need be exclusive.

27:40.392 --> 27:44.463
I mean, what if, in the
distant, distant past,

27:44.463 --> 27:48.167
each rotation of the Earth
took millions of years?

27:48.167 --> 27:48.967
Well--

27:48.967 --> 27:52.471
Or, from a biblical viewpoint,
what if God paused for millions

27:52.471 --> 27:54.173
of years between each day?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.041
I mean, Genesis
doesn't say anything

27:56.041 --> 27:58.010
about consecutive days.

27:58.010 --> 27:58.644
George--

27:58.644 --> 28:01.013
Or, better yet, what
if one day in heaven

28:01.013 --> 28:03.081
is a few millions of
years here on Earth?

28:03.081 --> 28:04.550
Maybe that's why God
hasn't made himself

28:04.550 --> 28:06.218
apparent to us in so long.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.986
It's still the seventh day.

28:07.986 --> 28:09.588
He's still resting.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.323
But maybe tomorrow, the
eighth day will begin,

28:11.323 --> 28:13.292
and he'll create
something entirely new,

28:13.292 --> 28:17.429
something just as
important as land or water.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.232
Such as?

28:20.232 --> 28:22.467
A horse that could
run backwards.

28:22.467 --> 28:23.468
I mean, think about it.

28:23.468 --> 28:25.137
You would never
need to turn around.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.242
George, do you have any
pertinent information

28:30.242 --> 28:31.443
about this case?

28:31.443 --> 28:33.111
Uh, yes, three things.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.180
First off, I spoke with
Mr. DeWitt's banker,

28:35.180 --> 28:37.049
and there's nothing fishy
going on with his accounts.

28:37.049 --> 28:37.716
Secondly?

28:37.716 --> 28:40.052
Uh, secondly, we
haven't been able to find

28:40.052 --> 28:42.287
anything about this young chap
who had a go at the fossil.

28:42.287 --> 28:44.022
We've been to every
church downtown.

28:44.022 --> 28:45.390
Nobody seems to know who he is.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.525
Well, that's odd.

28:46.525 --> 28:47.426
I thought so, as well.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.461
I am confident, however,
that we'll find him.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.531
Thirdly, I went through Mr.
DeWitt's journal, as you asked.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.199
I took the liberty
of copying it out.

28:54.199 --> 28:56.468
Cursive script was not
one of his strong suits.

28:56.468 --> 29:01.440
George, did you find anything
relevant to this investigation?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.442
Mr. DeWitt did seem to have
somewhat of an obsession

29:03.442 --> 29:05.143
with one particular area.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.678
He made note of it many times.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.046
What area is that?

29:08.046 --> 29:12.517
Well, actually, I recognize
it on your map here.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.254
It's right there.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.322
As the study of
paleontology has taught me,

29:17.322 --> 29:19.291
time marches forward.

29:19.291 --> 29:23.462
We are but a small part of an
ever-changing, ever-evolving

29:23.462 --> 29:27.232
world, and the time has come for
me to march forward, as well.

29:27.232 --> 29:30.569
So it is with pleasure--
and, admittedly, some

29:30.569 --> 29:33.672
sadness-- I turn
over this expedition

29:33.672 --> 29:36.742
and project to my worthy
and capable colleague,

29:36.742 --> 29:38.143
Mary Ann McConnell.

29:42.214 --> 29:45.250
Thank you, Mr. Blake,
for your confidence

29:45.250 --> 29:47.085
in me and my abilities.

29:47.085 --> 29:50.188
The expedition won't be
the same without you.

29:50.188 --> 29:53.625
Nor will it be the same without
Lukas DeWitt, whose death

29:53.625 --> 29:55.694
has cast such a pall
on what was supposed

29:55.694 --> 29:58.030
to be a happy occasion.

29:58.030 --> 30:01.166
I hope I can make
you both proud.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.001
Now, any questions for me?

30:03.001 --> 30:04.403
REPORTER: Uh, yes,
Miss McConnell--

30:04.403 --> 30:05.570
DET.
MURDOCH: Oh, Mr. Blake.

30:05.570 --> 30:06.405
Detective.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.173
REPORTER: Future
plans for the project?

30:08.173 --> 30:09.074
MARY ANN MCCONNELL: Well--

30:09.074 --> 30:11.443
I'm somewhat surprised by
this sudden turn of events.

30:11.443 --> 30:12.377
Why?

30:12.377 --> 30:16.181
Miss McConnell is an industrious
woman and a fine bone hunter.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.583
She convinced me she
deserved the opportunity.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.619
It seems to contradict
your earlier assessment

30:20.619 --> 30:23.255
of Miss McConnell's abilities.

30:23.255 --> 30:24.723
I'm a proud man, Detective.

30:24.723 --> 30:28.994
I don't like to lose,
including at love.

30:28.994 --> 30:32.064
I said some things about Miss
McConnell to you that I regret.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.232
But in the sober light
of second thought,

30:34.232 --> 30:37.169
I know this is the
right thing to do.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.070
Of course.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.371
And what of you?

30:39.371 --> 30:41.440
I'll take some time
before making a decision.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.175
But I assure you,
whatever I do next

30:43.175 --> 30:46.478
will make my last adventure
pale in comparison.

30:46.478 --> 30:50.415
Now, is there some way I
can help you, Detective?

30:50.415 --> 30:52.250
Yes, there is.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.552
I was wondering
if you could tell

30:53.552 --> 30:56.288
me what was at that location.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.122
Yes, of course.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.390
That's where I
discovered the femur.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.325
Why do you ask?

31:00.325 --> 31:02.461
It's just that Mr.
DeWitt noted the location

31:02.461 --> 31:04.196
several times in his journals.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.163
As well he should.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.066
It's a very important discovery.

31:08.066 --> 31:10.168
Indeed it is.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.437
Thank you very much for
your time, Mr. Blake.

31:15.507 --> 31:16.341
Ah, Detective.

31:16.341 --> 31:17.676
Miss McConnell.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.478
Um, have you good news?

31:19.478 --> 31:20.979
I hope to soon.

31:20.979 --> 31:23.448
But in the meantime, it seems
congratulations are in order.

31:23.448 --> 31:25.217
Oh, thank you.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.119
It's been a long time coming.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.153
Indeed it has.

31:28.153 --> 31:28.987
Good day.

[FLASH BULB POPS]

31:34.226 --> 31:35.594
DR. OGDEN: William.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.530
I believe I had something
that might interest you.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.499
The results came
back on the soil

31:40.499 --> 31:42.567
we found in our victim's skull.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.435
Oh, good.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.604
Were they able to determine
which formation it came from?

31:45.604 --> 31:46.638
No.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.472
No?

31:47.472 --> 31:48.340
So another dead-end?

31:48.340 --> 31:51.443
Well, they couldn't because
it wasn't soil at all.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.344
What was it?

31:52.344 --> 31:55.147
Pulverized concrete.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.548
Concrete?

31:56.548 --> 31:59.284
Well, there was plaster at
the site, but no concrete.

31:59.284 --> 32:02.320
Perhaps they were
building something?

32:02.320 --> 32:03.221
Hm.

32:03.221 --> 32:04.055
Maybe they were.

32:10.028 --> 32:11.329
What is the meaning of this?

32:11.329 --> 32:13.532
That bone should be on its way
to the train station by now.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.967
Who gave you permission
to examine it?

32:15.967 --> 32:18.503
This court order should
be permission enough.

32:18.503 --> 32:21.473
Really, Detective,
what is this all about?

32:21.473 --> 32:24.376
Mr. Blake, I need to take
a very special photograph

32:24.376 --> 32:26.545
of your spectacular find.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.648
Allow me to introduce Inspector
Brackenreid, Dr. Ogden.

32:29.648 --> 32:30.515
They'll be assisting me.

32:30.515 --> 32:31.683
Mr. Blake.

32:31.683 --> 32:32.551
Doctor.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.156
BARKELEY BLAKE: Uh, well,
shall I pose with it?

32:38.156 --> 32:41.293
Oh, I should think the bone
will be all that's needed.

32:41.293 --> 32:45.096
Would you once again hold the
photographic plate, Inspector?

32:45.096 --> 32:46.298
Certainly.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.499
You are sure this is safe?

32:47.499 --> 32:50.469
Of course.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.103
Everything is ready, Detective.

32:52.103 --> 32:53.672
Very good.

[POWERS OFF]

32:58.643 --> 33:00.579
Are you sure it
worked, Detective?

33:00.579 --> 33:02.380
I didn't see any
flash powder go off.

33:05.450 --> 33:08.253
It worked perfectly.

33:08.253 --> 33:10.622
Mr. Blake, your
prized fossil seems

33:10.622 --> 33:13.558
to have an iron rod running
through the middle of it.

33:21.566 --> 33:23.635
I don't believe it.

33:23.635 --> 33:24.469
Fake?

33:27.539 --> 33:30.475
Who would perpetrate
such a hoax?

33:30.475 --> 33:32.477
Let me think.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.746
Perhaps someone who
hasn't made a significant

33:34.746 --> 33:37.516
find in eight years?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.751
Someone who has been
sustaining his career

33:39.751 --> 33:45.156
through a combination of luck,
exploitation of his workers,

33:45.156 --> 33:49.327
and an unnerving drive
for center stage?

33:49.327 --> 33:54.099
Do you truly think
me that stupid?

33:54.099 --> 33:56.601
I think you're that desperate.

33:56.601 --> 34:00.505
I think Mr. DeWitt had
discovered what you had done.

34:00.505 --> 34:02.407
He'd been making a
careful study of the area,

34:02.407 --> 34:04.109
keeping meticulous records.

34:04.109 --> 34:05.577
In one of his field
journal entries,

34:05.577 --> 34:07.178
he noted that you
found the femur

34:07.178 --> 34:10.615
beneath Cenozoic detritus.

34:10.615 --> 34:14.019
There were no dinosaurs
in the Cenozoic era.

34:14.019 --> 34:16.254
That doesn't make sense.

34:16.254 --> 34:17.155
I agree.

34:17.155 --> 34:20.325
And I suspect it didn't make
sense to DeWitt, either.

34:20.325 --> 34:23.595
You said yourself
he knew his strata.

34:23.595 --> 34:26.031
So when he came to you
for an explanation,

34:26.031 --> 34:30.068
you realized he could expose
your fraud and killed him.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.438
And then packed up his body,
transported it to Toronto,

34:33.438 --> 34:35.273
and stuffed him in
a dinosaur's mouth

34:35.273 --> 34:38.343
in order to run the most
triumphant moment of my life?

34:38.343 --> 34:40.312
You had everything
to lose, Mr. Blake.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.447
And I was very
nearly destroyed.

34:42.447 --> 34:43.682
I'm the victim here, Detective.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.283
Can't you see that?

34:45.283 --> 34:49.988
Someone is clearly
out to destroy me.

34:49.988 --> 34:50.755
[KNOCK]

34:56.761 --> 35:00.398
Am I free to go?

35:00.398 --> 35:02.634
For now.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.570
But I am nowhere near finished
with you yet, Mr. Blake.

35:05.570 --> 35:06.538
Rest assured of that.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.078
You found the young
man with the hammer?

35:13.078 --> 35:15.580
Actually, sir, it was
Higgins who found him.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.482
I, uh, recognized him
from this photo taken

35:17.482 --> 35:18.483
at the Dinosaur Ball, sir.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.585
But he's no more a churchgoer
than Satan himself.

35:20.585 --> 35:21.453
Oh?

35:21.453 --> 35:23.655
No, he's a panhandler
on my beat, sir.

Goes by Clyde Dunbar.

35:25.023 --> 35:27.292

own mother for a dime.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.226
And where is he now?

35:28.226 --> 35:29.594
He's cooling his heels
in one of the cells.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.200
Mr. Dunbar.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.201
Who's asking?

35:36.201 --> 35:38.603
I'm Detective William Murdoch.

35:38.603 --> 35:40.438
That supposed to
mean something?

35:40.438 --> 35:41.539
Perhaps.

35:41.539 --> 35:42.974
Such as?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.643
Such as whether
you hang or not.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.477
Wait a minute.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.645
What are you talking about?

35:46.645 --> 35:48.647
Mr. Dunbar, the
last time I saw you,

35:48.647 --> 35:51.616
you had a hammer in your hand
and you were attacking a fossil

35:51.616 --> 35:52.984
in the name of the Lord.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.619
You're mistaking me
for some other lad.

35:54.619 --> 35:56.454
Moments later, a man
was found murdered,

35:56.454 --> 35:58.990
and I think you had
something to do with it.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.325
Now hold on there.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.060
You got it all wrong.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.496
I didn't have nothing
to do with any murder.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.297
I'm not even a religious man.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.601
Then what was all that yelling
about hellfire and blasphemy?

36:09.601 --> 36:11.002
[SIGH]

36:11.703 --> 36:13.638
That's what he told me to say.

36:13.638 --> 36:14.472
Who?

36:14.472 --> 36:16.508
That's what who told you to say?

36:16.508 --> 36:17.342
I don't know.

36:17.342 --> 36:20.078
A man.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.312
Came up to me on
the street, said

36:21.312 --> 36:22.547
he'd give me a
fiver if I smashed

36:22.547 --> 36:23.982
that bone with a hammer.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.985
So I got on as a
waiter at the hall,

36:26.985 --> 36:29.621
and-- well, you were there.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.222
This man, can you describe him?

36:31.222 --> 36:34.626
He was old, about your age.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.428
I see.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.595
Was he balding?

36:37.595 --> 36:39.764
Thick glasses,
close-cropped beard?

36:39.764 --> 36:41.299
Yeah, that's him.

36:41.299 --> 36:45.737
And if you see him, tell him
he still owes me the money.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.238
RUDOLPH SUTTON: A
fake-- a fake, you say?

36:47.238 --> 36:48.573
Are you absolutely certain?

36:48.573 --> 36:49.407
I am.

36:49.407 --> 36:53.044
I was able to examine
it using a radiograph.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.547
Oh.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.315
That is something that
I never considered

36:57.315 --> 36:58.717
when I devised my plan.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.585
You admit to building
the bone, then?

37:00.585 --> 37:01.586
Proudly.

37:01.586 --> 37:04.289
The truth finally comes out.

37:04.289 --> 37:08.126
I, uh, I am only sorry that
I failed to publicly expose

37:08.126 --> 37:10.628
Blake for the fool that he is.

37:10.628 --> 37:13.164
I don't think you quite
realize the seriousness of the

37:13.164 --> 37:14.666
situation you're in, Professor.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.967
Oh, I understand.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.202
I understand all too well.

37:17.202 --> 37:18.203
I was so close!

37:18.203 --> 37:20.105
So close.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.173
It was going to be
Barkeley's utter ruin.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.476
And in front of the National
Geographic Society, no less.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.512
But unfortunately, Lukas
DeWitt had to get in the way.

37:27.512 --> 37:30.348
He suspected the bone was a fake
and confronted you about it.

37:30.348 --> 37:31.683
He did no such thing.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.586
But your need to destroy
Blake was so great,

37:34.586 --> 37:37.322
you killed DeWitt to keep
him from exposing your plan.

37:37.322 --> 37:39.357
No, I only wanted
revenge on Barkeley.

37:39.357 --> 37:41.426
I had no differences with Lukas.

37:41.426 --> 37:46.030
D-- Detective, you may think
me a small and petty man,

37:46.030 --> 37:47.198
but I'm no murderer.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.636
Was it worth it, Professor?

37:51.636 --> 37:54.172
To reveal Barkeley as a fraud?

37:54.172 --> 37:55.273
Yes.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.075
You'll forever be
remembered as the man

37:57.075 --> 37:58.743
who perpetrated this hoax.

37:58.743 --> 38:01.279
The hoax may be
remembered, may not.

38:01.279 --> 38:06.751
And-- and as for me, I-- I have
always been a forgettable man.

38:06.751 --> 38:09.220
For future generations, my
contribution to this discipline

38:09.220 --> 38:11.356
will never be forgotten,
and-- and that,

38:11.356 --> 38:12.590
Detective, is as it should be.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.668
I take it you
received permission

38:23.668 --> 38:25.603
to conduct the post-mortem?

38:25.603 --> 38:27.739
Under the supervision
of the tiresome Dr.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.175
Hitchcock of Philadelphia.

38:30.175 --> 38:31.709
Fortunately, he was more
interested in a side trip

38:31.709 --> 38:34.612
to Niagara Falls than
the post-mortem itself.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.981
And I hope you have
some good news for me.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.984
Is the case frustrating you?

38:39.984 --> 38:43.488
I have two suspects, Mr.
Blake and Professor Sutton,

38:43.488 --> 38:47.258
both with means,
motive, and opportunity.

38:47.258 --> 38:49.127
Unfortunately, I haven't
a shred of evidence

38:49.127 --> 38:51.296
to tie either to the murder.

38:51.296 --> 38:54.098
I'm afraid I'm not going
to be of much help to you.

38:54.098 --> 38:55.967
My original supposition
was correct.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.404
Lukas DeWitt died as a
result of trauma to the head.

38:59.404 --> 39:01.673
However, the post-mortem
wasn't without

39:01.673 --> 39:04.509
its interesting revelations.

39:04.509 --> 39:08.279
I discovered some fascinating
things about mummification.

39:08.279 --> 39:10.014
Such as?

39:10.014 --> 39:12.283
Well, the process can
actually start as quickly as

39:12.283 --> 39:14.986
within three days of
death, so Mr. DeWitt's skin

39:14.986 --> 39:16.688
had already begun to harden.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.522
Interesting.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.523
Isn't it?

39:18.523 --> 39:20.291
What's fascinating
is, it actually began

39:20.291 --> 39:22.227
to meld around his clothing.

39:22.227 --> 39:24.762
In fact, I found tiny marks
where the weight of the plaster

39:24.762 --> 39:27.365
had pressed his shirt
buttons against his skin.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.067
I could even see that
he wore some sort

39:29.067 --> 39:32.237
of medallion or pendant.

39:32.237 --> 39:33.638
That's odd.

39:33.638 --> 39:36.441
Nothing like that was
found on his body.

39:36.441 --> 39:39.677
Well, it was on his person
when he was wrapped in plaster.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.980
You can see the
mark for yourself.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.048
It's hard to detect, but if
you find the right angle,

39:44.048 --> 39:46.618
you'll note it has a
very distinctive pattern.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.486
Dr. Ogden, have you a candle?

40:10.041 --> 40:13.211
Recognize this?

40:13.211 --> 40:16.381
It's a replica of an ammonite.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.082
What of it?

40:18.082 --> 40:21.386
It's a cast of an imprint we
found on Lukas DeWitt's body.

40:21.386 --> 40:25.356
It was caused by a fossil-shaped
pendant that was on his body

40:25.356 --> 40:27.992
when he was wrapped in plastic.

40:27.992 --> 40:31.496
However, the pendant wasn't
there when we found his body.

40:31.496 --> 40:34.299
Must have been lost, then.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.266
May I see yours?

40:38.736 --> 40:40.238
There's no need.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.978
Your match.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.280
I know you killed him.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.982
You wrapped and
plastered his body

40:50.982 --> 40:53.051
and shipped here
like another rock.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.018
You don't know anything.

40:54.018 --> 40:56.287
And then you left his body
for the world to discover.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.190
What I can't understand is why?

40:59.190 --> 41:03.661
Because I wanted
Barkeley to pay.

41:03.661 --> 41:06.564
He took everything
from me, everything.

41:06.564 --> 41:08.433
He took credit for my work.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.601
He denied me my proper
due at every turn.

41:10.601 --> 41:15.039
He took the life of
the man who loved me.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.478
What happened?

41:20.478 --> 41:24.649
I-- I'd forgotten
to put my pick away,

41:24.649 --> 41:31.055
so I walked back to get it.

41:31.055 --> 41:33.324
And that's when I
saw them arguing.

41:37.695 --> 41:42.667

and hit Lukas with it.

back of the head with a pick

41:49.607 --> 41:51.576

41:51.576 --> 41:55.013
I mean I was not in control
of myself at the time.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.181
Lukas confronted you
about the bone, didn't he?

41:57.181 --> 41:58.049
He did.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.986
He couldn't understand
how I'd found it.

42:01.986 --> 42:05.323
He accused me of
having faked it.

42:05.323 --> 42:06.724
When he showed me
it was concrete,

42:06.724 --> 42:09.627
I realized I'd been had.

It was a brilliant
plan, and I fell for it.

42:22.106 --> 42:23.975
But by then, you
had already contacted

42:23.975 --> 42:28.146
the National Geographic Society
about your extraordinary find.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.081
Eight years ago, I was
just another geologist,

42:30.081 --> 42:34.452
and then I stumbled on
something that made me special.

42:34.452 --> 42:37.021
I knew that until I
repeated that success,

42:37.021 --> 42:39.390
I would still be a
fraud in my own mind.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.393
And if news got out, you
would have been ruined.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.694
So you panicked.

42:43.694 --> 42:49.333

that bone to be real.

42:52.637 --> 42:55.206
But it didn't
end there, did it?

42:55.206 --> 42:57.008
There was so much
excavation going on

42:57.008 --> 42:59.544
in the area, new expeditions
coming in-- I couldn't

42:59.544 --> 43:01.746
risk the body being found.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.182
Inevitable questions would
lead right back to me.

43:07.485 --> 43:15.593
So I prepared his body
like the other fossils.

43:15.593 --> 43:19.197
I planned to dispose of them
later after the exhibition.

43:19.197 --> 43:21.099
And what about the
Terrasaurus bone?

43:21.099 --> 43:22.500
You couldn't risk
it being discovered

43:22.500 --> 43:24.735

Sutton to have

43:31.976 --> 43:35.012
to come up with some other

I suppose so, yes.

43:39.117 --> 43:45.490
Detective, I spent so much
time amongst the dead,

43:45.490 --> 43:47.358
yet it never
prepared me for this.

No.

I suppose it didn't.

44:00.071 --> 44:03.341
DR. OGDEN: So Miss McConnell
was blackmailing Mr. Blake.

44:03.341 --> 44:06.544
She happened upon the murder
as it was being committed.

44:06.544 --> 44:08.045
And she chose not
to go to the police?

44:08.045 --> 44:08.679
Yes.

44:08.679 --> 44:11.382
She chose instead to use
the murder against him.

44:11.382 --> 44:12.216
Against him?

44:12.216 --> 44:13.217
To what end?

44:13.217 --> 44:15.219
To further her career.

44:15.219 --> 44:19.190
But Barkeley refused to give
in to her demands-- initially.

44:19.190 --> 44:22.160
So to prove she was serious,
she put the body on display

44:22.160 --> 44:23.561
for the world to see.

44:23.561 --> 44:24.762
Yes.

She took Lukas's body when
it first arrived here,

44:27.498 --> 44:30.568
before Blake could retrieve
it, and in doing so

44:30.568 --> 44:33.437
became an accessory
after the fact to murder.

Amongst a number of other
