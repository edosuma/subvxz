01:21:02.852 --> 01:21:07.482
[Man Narrating] My story begins
when I was but a lad of 16.

01:21:07.572 --> 01:21:10.882
It was the year I became a novice
at Brother Gilbert's monastery,

01:21:10.972 --> 01:21:13.566
when I first heard
the prophecy.

01:21:13.652 --> 01:21:16.450
A drag ors heart
could do mankind...

01:21:16.532 --> 01:21:20.810
when a two-tailed comet
blazed across the night sky.

01:21:22.412 --> 01:21:24.243
I paid this leg end
little heed,

01:21:24.332 --> 01:21:28.325
for I had come for a quiet
life of prayer and devotion.

01:21:28.412 --> 01:21:32.564
Besides, everyone knew
there were no more drag ons.

01:21:35.212 --> 01:21:39.205
The last, Draco,
had been slain by Sir Bowen,

01:21:39.292 --> 01:21:42.523
a knight of the old code.

01:21:42.612 --> 01:21:45.843
I later learned that in
the last year of his life,

01:21:45.932 --> 01:21:49.129
Bowen returned
to Draco's cave.

01:21:49.212 --> 01:21:52.045
There he was granted
a miracle,

01:21:52.132 --> 01:21:57.206
a drag on egg
about to hatch.

01:21:57.292 --> 01:22:01.046
The dying knight entrusted
the hatchling to our monastery.

01:22:01.132 --> 01:22:05.171
Fearful evil might dwell
in this drag ors heart,

01:22:05.252 --> 01:22:08.130
Friar Peter and the abbot
pledged to hide him away...

01:22:08.212 --> 01:22:11.045
until the comet had passed.

01:22:11.132 --> 01:22:13.885
For 20 years,
they carefully guarded...

01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:16.281
the secret
locked beneath us.

01:22:45.452 --> 01:22:48.171
Eight days before
the comet's arrival,

01:22:48.252 --> 01:22:52.006
my quiet life
was turned upside down.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:56.370
Before the week was out,
I'd be embroiled in deception,

01:22:56.452 --> 01:22:59.444
mystery and battle.

01:22:59.532 --> 01:23:01.363
And who could have known
that Geoff,

01:23:01.452 --> 01:23:03.841
the orphan stable boy
at our monastery,

01:23:03.932 --> 01:23:06.446
would reveal
the deepest secret...

01:23:06.532 --> 01:23:10.445
of what is truly
in a drag ors heart.

01:24:29.372 --> 01:24:32.967
[Man] Make way for the
king's noble knights.

01:25:03.892 --> 01:25:05.723
Wishing to be
one of them...

01:25:05.812 --> 01:25:10.488
won't get the stables
cleaned any faster.

01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:12.767
Where do you think they're
headed all dressed up like that?

01:25:14.172 --> 01:25:16.163
They're off
to the castle...

01:25:16.252 --> 01:25:18.447
to honor Lord Osric
being sworn in...

01:25:18.532 --> 01:25:21.046
as the king's
chief advisor.

01:25:21.132 --> 01:25:23.930
The castle.
[Bell Tolling]

01:25:30.372 --> 01:25:32.283
I suggest you get back
to the stable...

01:25:32.372 --> 01:25:34.363
before the abbot
catches you around.

01:25:34.452 --> 01:25:38.365
I promise I will have the stables scrubbed
cleaner than the abbot's table by vespers.

01:25:38.452 --> 01:25:41.125
And, Friar Peter, I will even
clean that old dung eon for you,

01:25:41.212 --> 01:25:43.043
if you just unlock it
for me.

01:25:43.132 --> 01:25:46.886
I'll tell you a secret about that
dung eon: There's nothing down there...

01:25:46.972 --> 01:25:49.884
that can transform you
into a knight.

01:25:49.972 --> 01:25:52.088
You're a good boy
at heart.

01:25:52.172 --> 01:25:55.448
If you work hard
and practice humility,

01:25:55.532 --> 01:25:59.047
you'll be a fine
stable master some day.

01:26:05.012 --> 01:26:09.563
I'll be outta here long before
I'm any kind of stable master.

01:26:11.612 --> 01:26:15.161
[Man]
I, Lord Osric of Crosley,

01:26:15.252 --> 01:26:18.130
choose the old code
as my oath.

01:26:18.212 --> 01:26:20.567
I am hereby sworn
to valor,

01:26:20.652 --> 01:26:22.643
to speak
only the truth,

01:26:22.732 --> 01:26:25.041
to use arms
to defend the helpless,

01:26:25.132 --> 01:26:27.692
to use might
to uphold the weak.

01:26:27.772 --> 01:26:30.081
My heart
knows only virtue.

01:26:30.172 --> 01:26:33.528
My wrath will
undo the wicked.

01:26:41.372 --> 01:26:43.328
My king.

01:26:47.012 --> 01:26:52.166
As chief advisor, my goal is nothing
less than ensuring that the old code...

01:26:52.252 --> 01:26:55.005
lives on in the hearts
and minds of all people.

01:26:55.092 --> 01:26:58.323
Everyone should share
in our kingdom's bounty.

01:26:58.412 --> 01:27:01.449
Tomorrow, I shall bestow
a personal gift...

01:27:01.532 --> 01:27:05.764
on all men, women and
children in the land. A gift?

01:27:08.132 --> 01:27:11.169
Is it my birthday?
No, Sire.

01:27:11.252 --> 01:27:13.129
[Narrator] Everyone was
pleased when Lord Osric...

01:27:13.212 --> 01:27:15.043
was named chief advisor...

01:27:15.132 --> 01:27:19.011
since our beloved king's
behavior had become so...

01:27:19.092 --> 01:27:20.969
unusual of late.

01:27:22.372 --> 01:27:25.921
Everyone will receive
two new tunics...

01:27:26.012 --> 01:27:29.607
in the style and color suited
to their inerited station.

01:27:29.692 --> 01:27:33.446
From now on, no one
will wear anything else.

01:27:33.812 --> 01:27:36.610
[Narrator]
There I was, so young,

01:27:36.692 --> 01:27:41.208
a mere novice entrusted with the
monastery's most important secret.

01:27:41.292 --> 01:27:43.522
Silence was my solemn vow.

01:27:43.612 --> 01:27:46.410
Mansel, what are you doing? Geoff.

01:27:46.492 --> 01:27:49.928
Looks like old Friar Peter's cauldron.
What would you be doing with that?

01:27:50.012 --> 01:27:53.402
Can you keep a secret?
You know I can.

01:27:53.492 --> 01:27:56.290
Friar Peter gave me
a new chore to do.

01:27:56.372 --> 01:27:58.328
Ooh. Lucky you.
What is it?

01:27:58.412 --> 01:28:01.370
I told you, it's a secret. Fine.

01:28:01.452 --> 01:28:04.091
A secret chore
from Friar Peter.

01:28:04.172 --> 01:28:06.049
That's pretty special.
Don't you think?

01:28:06.132 --> 01:28:08.009
Maybe just
a little special, yes.

01:28:08.092 --> 01:28:10.845
Don't say it like that. Take
some pride in being special.

01:28:10.932 --> 01:28:13.048
All right,
I am special.

01:28:13.132 --> 01:28:16.408
It's not like pride's one of those
seven deadly sins or anything.

01:28:16.492 --> 01:28:19.006
Actually, it is.

01:28:19.092 --> 01:28:20.923
[Pig Squealing]

01:28:26.932 --> 01:28:29.890
You're right, Geoff. Manual
labor sure keeps the soul humble.

01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:32.327
- Thank you for getting me to do this.
- Any time.

01:28:32.412 --> 01:28:34.721
Don't forget
the corners.

01:28:55.132 --> 01:28:58.090
- [Knocking]
- Yes?

01:28:58.172 --> 01:29:02.085
Two most unusual strangers are asking
after Brother Gilbert's writings.

01:29:02.172 --> 01:29:04.970
The abbot has sent
them to you. Very well.

01:29:06.732 --> 01:29:09.530
This is Master Kwan
and his son.

01:29:30.492 --> 01:29:33.882
I fear I don't have
much hospitality to offer.

01:29:33.972 --> 01:29:38.170
Oh. I spent my youth in a
monastery much like this one,

01:29:38.252 --> 01:29:40.482
but we do not
seek comfort.

01:29:40.572 --> 01:29:44.485
We have come from Hebei Province,
where man and drag ons lived in peace.

01:29:44.572 --> 01:29:48.565
Many years ago, a terrible
evil set drag on against man,

01:29:48.652 --> 01:29:51.849
and all our drag ons
were destroyed.

01:29:51.932 --> 01:29:55.368
A terrible tale. Though I
have to say, I don't see...

01:29:55.452 --> 01:29:57.761
what this has
to do with me.

01:29:57.852 --> 01:30:00.685
I'm told that the founder
of this monastery...

01:30:00.772 --> 01:30:02.842
wrote extensively
about drag ons,

01:30:02.932 --> 01:30:06.208
and that you are
the guardian of his scrolls.

01:30:06.292 --> 01:30:08.726
Brother Gilbert
was a kind soul...

01:30:08.812 --> 01:30:13.522
with a fanciful imagination
and a poor hand at poetry.

01:30:15.052 --> 01:30:16.883
It has been read
in the stars...

01:30:16.972 --> 01:30:19.486
that a new drag on
was born.

01:30:19.572 --> 01:30:23.360
Surely you are aware that the prophesied
comet will return in eight days.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:27.525
We must prevent the evil from
taking hold again. I am a man of God.

01:30:27.612 --> 01:30:30.968
I do not believe
in such superstitious prattle.

01:30:32.292 --> 01:30:35.841
Then... the drag on talon
in your pocket...

01:30:35.932 --> 01:30:37.809
is a meaningless
talisman?

01:30:39.452 --> 01:30:43.206
It has meaning only
to the monks of this order.

01:30:43.292 --> 01:30:48.286
It was passed on by Brother Gilbert,
who received it from Sir Bowen.

01:30:48.372 --> 01:30:53.241
He claimed it belong ed
to Draco, the last drag on.

01:31:15.452 --> 01:31:19.491
[Kwan] But we must test the
drag on before the comet arrives.

01:31:19.572 --> 01:31:22.086
[Friar Peter]
There are no drag ons here.

01:31:22.172 --> 01:31:25.164
But Lord Osric knows
about stars and comets.

01:31:25.252 --> 01:31:27.322
Perhaps he can help you.

01:31:27.412 --> 01:31:31.291
[Kwan] Thank you. Good night.

01:32:15.932 --> 01:32:18.287
What would Mansel
be doing down here?

01:32:54.812 --> 01:32:57.963
Ah. This was not
a good idea.

01:33:13.692 --> 01:33:15.523
[Screams]

01:33:54.372 --> 01:33:56.522
[Growling]

01:34:01.412 --> 01:34:03.687
Stay away from me!

01:34:13.532 --> 01:34:16.285
[Growling,
Sniffing]

01:34:44.172 --> 01:34:48.962
[Growling Continues]

01:35:01.052 --> 01:35:04.840
You know, you-you'd better... You'd
better g o. You're not supposed to be here.

01:35:06.172 --> 01:35:08.003
How long have you
been down here?

01:35:10.492 --> 01:35:12.369
I've always been here.

01:35:13.772 --> 01:35:16.730
- I'm Geoff.
- I'm Drake.

01:35:22.012 --> 01:35:25.129
Here. Give me that.

01:35:25.212 --> 01:35:27.851
Seven lashes to anyone
caught without their tunic.

01:35:41.772 --> 01:35:44.332
Those men from the East
are still waiting, Lord.

01:35:44.412 --> 01:35:46.403
Show them in.

01:35:56.132 --> 01:35:58.168
Please.

01:35:59.652 --> 01:36:02.041
[Kwan]
Thank you for seeing us.

01:36:02.132 --> 01:36:04.487
Not at all.
It's an honor.

01:36:04.572 --> 01:36:09.327
We are on a quest related to the
arrival of the two-tailed comet.

01:36:09.412 --> 01:36:11.243
Well, you don't have
much time.

01:36:11.332 --> 01:36:16.452
According to my star charts and calculations,
the comet will return one week from today.

01:36:16.532 --> 01:36:18.363
What do you hope
to accomplish?

01:36:18.452 --> 01:36:21.091
We seek the drag on
of the prophecy.

01:36:22.612 --> 01:36:25.729
Hmm. A noble
though nonsensical mission,

01:36:25.812 --> 01:36:28.645
since nothing is left
of drag ons but their leg end.

01:36:28.732 --> 01:36:33.726
- Respectfully. I saw a drag ors claw just last night.
- Did you?

01:36:33.812 --> 01:36:37.566
Friar Peter claimed
it belong ed to Draco himself,

01:36:37.652 --> 01:36:39.483
but can we be sure?

01:36:42.052 --> 01:36:45.442
All this talk of drag ons
and prophecies...

01:36:45.532 --> 01:36:47.841
will frighten
the common people.

01:36:47.932 --> 01:36:50.765
They're terrified of drag ons,
with good reason.

01:36:52.772 --> 01:36:56.401
For your own safety, you should
leave this kingdom tonight.

01:36:56.492 --> 01:37:00.485
Stefan, see them safely
to the border.

01:37:00.572 --> 01:37:03.325
[Bell Tolling]

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:07.685
[Narrator] Back at the monastery,
Geoff visited the dung eon...

01:37:07.772 --> 01:37:09.922
every chance he got.

01:37:10.012 --> 01:37:11.968
I suspect he hoped
that knowing Drake...

01:37:12.052 --> 01:37:16.284
would somehow lead
to adventure and fame.

01:37:16.372 --> 01:37:20.490
Geoff must have been sorely disappointed
to learn he had befriended a drag on...

01:37:20.572 --> 01:37:24.929
who had no idea how to fly
or breathe fire.

01:37:26.452 --> 01:37:29.171
Oh, come on, Geoff. Your
tunic doesn't look that bad.

01:37:29.252 --> 01:37:33.131
I hate this thing. Itches and
it's the color of worm vomit.

01:37:33.212 --> 01:37:35.362
That's not the color
of my vomit.

01:37:36.732 --> 01:37:38.882
The old code
doesn't say anything...

01:37:38.972 --> 01:37:40.963
about what you've got to wear
to become a knight.

01:37:41.052 --> 01:37:43.202
Well, I've got about as much
chance of becoming a knight...

01:37:43.292 --> 01:37:45.442
as I do of convincing you
to come outside.

01:37:45.532 --> 01:37:48.444
Friar Peter made me promise
that I would never g o outside.

01:37:48.532 --> 01:37:51.649
You're a drag on.
Act like one.

01:37:51.732 --> 01:37:53.643
Hey.

01:37:53.692 --> 01:37:55.569
Here. Allow me.

01:38:06.172 --> 01:38:08.481
It's Friar Peter.
Oh, no.

01:38:08.572 --> 01:38:11.166
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He can't find you down here.

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:13.083
Hide.

01:38:19.932 --> 01:38:21.763
Drake?
Yes?

01:38:21.852 --> 01:38:23.888
I have sad news.

01:38:23.972 --> 01:38:26.327
M- Mansel?
What?

01:38:27.532 --> 01:38:29.887
What is it?

01:38:32.692 --> 01:38:35.809
Friar Peter is g one.
Where did he g o?

01:38:35.892 --> 01:38:39.646
He went to heaven.
Do you know what that means?

01:38:40.852 --> 01:38:44.288
Oh, yes.
Did it hurt him to die?

01:38:44.372 --> 01:38:48.888
I don't think so. He seemed
fine yesterday, but he was old.

01:38:48.972 --> 01:38:51.532
This morning
he just didn't wake up.

01:38:53.332 --> 01:38:55.527
He was very fond of you,
you know.

01:38:58.172 --> 01:39:01.164
I know I am not
Friar Peter,

01:39:01.252 --> 01:39:04.005
but I will do my best
to take care of you.

01:39:04.092 --> 01:39:06.162
I promise.

01:39:08.492 --> 01:39:11.165
Thank you, Mansel.

01:39:11.252 --> 01:39:15.928
[Groaning]

01:39:16.972 --> 01:39:19.327
I was just taking
to him.

01:39:21.052 --> 01:39:22.883
I can't believe he...

01:39:22.972 --> 01:39:26.203
I don't feel
like talking now.

01:39:26.292 --> 01:39:29.090
I'd like to be alone.

01:40:06.652 --> 01:40:09.325
[Whinnies]

01:40:14.652 --> 01:40:17.724
It's that stable boy
from the monastery.

01:40:17.812 --> 01:40:19.928
[Man]
Oh, let's pay him a visit.

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:27.691
U p. U p. U p.
[Whinnies]

01:40:27.772 --> 01:40:29.728
Whoa.

01:40:35.092 --> 01:40:38.084
H i. I saw you yesterday.

01:40:38.172 --> 01:40:41.005
I'm sorry I didn't stop
to meet you. I'm Roland.

01:40:42.172 --> 01:40:45.767
I'm Geoff. Um, how
was the castle? Geoff.

01:40:45.852 --> 01:40:49.049
Old and stuffy,
but you know how it is.

01:40:49.132 --> 01:40:53.603
- Well, I hardly ever g o there anymore.
- You've got a sword.

01:40:53.692 --> 01:40:57.605
You want to try your hand with us? Sure.

01:41:06.972 --> 01:41:09.725
[Man Chuckles]
The stable boy's not bad.

01:41:27.532 --> 01:41:29.363
We're just practicing.

01:41:37.492 --> 01:41:40.768
[Screams]
[Men Laughing]

01:41:42.332 --> 01:41:45.210
If we weren't practicing,
you'd be dead, stable boy.

01:41:45.292 --> 01:41:48.045
Now, lower your eyes.

01:41:48.132 --> 01:41:51.522
Peasants should never meet
the gaze of their betters.

01:41:51.612 --> 01:41:54.080
[Men Murmuring,
Laughing]

01:42:06.252 --> 01:42:10.484
- So, this is what it's like outside.
- Drake!

01:42:13.972 --> 01:42:15.803
You had to come out here now,
didn't you?

01:42:17.172 --> 01:42:19.845
I never got to say good-bye
to Friar Peter.

01:42:19.932 --> 01:42:23.049
He was the only one
who knew about drag ons.

01:42:25.812 --> 01:42:28.007
You're lucky to have had him
as long as you did.

01:42:29.132 --> 01:42:31.248
But my heart hurts.

01:42:40.892 --> 01:42:42.769
You won't feel
this bad forever.

01:42:46.372 --> 01:42:47.930
[Indistinct Chattering]

01:42:56.172 --> 01:42:59.687
Today I make two edicts
in accordance with the old code.

01:42:59.772 --> 01:43:02.366
To defend our helpless
and uphold our weak,

01:43:02.452 --> 01:43:06.684
those people wearing green,
beige and brown tunics...

01:43:06.772 --> 01:43:09.081
must be indoors
one hour after sunset.

01:43:09.172 --> 01:43:12.448
Time for
your evening tonic, sire.

01:43:12.532 --> 01:43:14.363
And from this day forward,

01:43:14.452 --> 01:43:19.321
only the words of truth
will be spoken in our kingdom.

01:43:19.412 --> 01:43:21.642
[Applause]

01:43:29.212 --> 01:43:33.524
Who does Osric think he is? Next thing you
know, he's gonna be telling people what to think.

01:43:33.612 --> 01:43:36.251
If they wanna let him
do that, he probably can.

01:43:36.332 --> 01:43:39.642
Well, not me. You're
throwing your tunic away?

01:43:39.732 --> 01:43:42.530
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

01:43:42.612 --> 01:43:45.490
- Let's fly away from here.
- But I don't wanna fly.

01:43:45.572 --> 01:43:48.564
Of course you want to fly. What do
you think those wings of yours are for?

01:43:48.612 --> 01:43:50.682
Hmm.
You see those mountains?

01:43:50.772 --> 01:43:53.605
Beyond those are-are
other kinds of people...

01:43:53.692 --> 01:43:56.286
and treasure and adventure
and glory.

01:43:58.092 --> 01:44:00.401
[Geoff, Indistinct]

01:44:00.492 --> 01:44:02.323
Hmm?

01:44:06.252 --> 01:44:08.641
[Kwan] So he lives.
The stars didn't lie.

01:44:16.412 --> 01:44:18.482
[Man] Those foreigners
had to come back this way.

01:44:18.572 --> 01:44:21.530
They can't be far.
Let's split up.

01:44:24.412 --> 01:44:26.243
[Man]
This way!

01:44:28.892 --> 01:44:30.803
[Geoff Shouting,
Indistinct]

01:44:32.092 --> 01:44:34.242
[Kwan]
He's a very young drag on.

01:44:34.332 --> 01:44:38.803
We must not allow sentiment
to interfere with our mission.

01:44:42.652 --> 01:44:44.483
That boy was
at the monastery.

01:44:44.572 --> 01:44:47.484
And then we could come back and be
more famous than Bowen and Draco.

01:44:47.572 --> 01:44:49.847
[Growling] All you have to do
is just open your wings and jump.

01:44:49.932 --> 01:44:52.924
I'm not going anywhere. I'm
staying right here. I like it here.

01:44:53.012 --> 01:44:55.003
If it's so easy, you
show me how to do it.

01:44:55.092 --> 01:44:56.923
It would have been
better for everybody...

01:44:57.012 --> 01:44:59.367
if I was the drag on
and you were the stable boy.

01:44:59.452 --> 01:45:01.761
Go ahead. I'd like to
see that. Stupid drag on.

01:45:17.932 --> 01:45:19.763
Oops.

01:45:24.732 --> 01:45:26.723
He's got no tunic.

01:45:26.812 --> 01:45:31.886
Let me read your minds. You wanna
know why I'm not wearing my tunic.

01:45:31.972 --> 01:45:33.928
Yeah. Well, let me tell
you... [Continues, Indistinct]

01:45:34.012 --> 01:45:36.651
- The boy can take us to the drag on.
- It's a funny story, actually.

01:45:36.732 --> 01:45:40.281
You see,
today was the day when...

01:45:40.372 --> 01:45:43.011
all the monks
clean the privies.

01:45:43.092 --> 01:45:47.449
[Man] What's he take us for? And old Friar
Gustav must have thought that my tunic...

01:45:47.532 --> 01:45:51.127
was a rag or something,
because he used it to wipe up...

01:45:51.212 --> 01:45:54.363
Seven lashes
for the tunic...

01:45:54.452 --> 01:45:56.647
and ten for the lie.

01:45:56.732 --> 01:45:59.200
[Men Murmuring In Agreement]
We seem to have lost our way.

01:45:59.292 --> 01:46:02.364
Perhaps you can point us
in the proper direction?

01:46:05.052 --> 01:46:07.805
Lord Osric told you
to get out of town.

01:46:07.892 --> 01:46:13.046
Now, the only direction I'll show
you is toward the castle dung eon.

01:46:25.852 --> 01:46:28.127
Take him!

01:46:31.132 --> 01:46:33.771
Be gentle with them.

01:46:38.252 --> 01:46:41.289
[Grunting]

01:46:59.372 --> 01:47:02.330
[Both Grunting]

01:47:42.292 --> 01:47:44.567
[Man]
Come on!

01:47:46.572 --> 01:47:49.291
[Screaming]

01:47:54.812 --> 01:47:57.007
You're a girl?

01:47:58.772 --> 01:48:01.764
I'm Kwan.
This is Lian.

01:48:01.852 --> 01:48:04.286
[Men Yelling]

01:48:04.372 --> 01:48:06.249
We should leave
this area.

01:48:09.852 --> 01:48:13.367
This way!
Get him!

01:48:13.452 --> 01:48:15.522
Drake! Drake!

01:48:16.132 --> 01:48:17.645
I'm being followed.
You gotta hide.

01:48:17.732 --> 01:48:20.610
If the guards see us, we're dead. Dead?

01:48:20.692 --> 01:48:23.525
Dead? I don't wanna die.
What's happening to you?

01:48:24.572 --> 01:48:26.961
Oh, my.
[Groans]

01:48:27.052 --> 01:48:29.520
After him!

01:48:29.612 --> 01:48:32.763
[Whinnies]

01:48:32.852 --> 01:48:35.650
[Grunts]
Hello again.

01:48:35.732 --> 01:48:37.643
N ice day to run
the horses, huh?

01:48:41.212 --> 01:48:43.043
Where are the foreigners?

01:48:43.132 --> 01:48:45.805
I don't know.
They disappeared.

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:48.685
No one can just disappear,

01:48:48.732 --> 01:48:51.121
unless I make them.

01:48:56.492 --> 01:49:00.201
All right. I give up.
Take me to the dung eon now.

01:49:00.252 --> 01:49:02.641
You're not getting off
that easy.

01:49:04.572 --> 01:49:07.689
[Screaming]

01:49:07.772 --> 01:49:10.525

01:49:10.612 --> 01:49:12.807
[Screaming]

01:49:20.572 --> 01:49:23.040
I've got you.
It's all right.

01:49:23.132 --> 01:49:26.044
Drake, you're flying.
Of course we're flying.

01:49:26.132 --> 01:49:28.202
How do you think
we got way up here?

01:49:28.292 --> 01:49:30.681
Ah, this is great.
Let's g o up higher.

01:49:30.772 --> 01:49:32.683
Hey! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:49:32.772 --> 01:49:34.603
Okay. Let's swoop down
and scare the villagers.

01:49:34.692 --> 01:49:36.648
Oh, no. This is
dangerous enough as it is.

01:49:36.732 --> 01:49:39.565
Don't sound so scared. You've
done the hard part already.

01:49:39.612 --> 01:49:43.685
Actually, I think the hard part is going
to be getting down! Everybody, look out!

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:47.962
Next thing I know, three Tere
goths, just me. What's that up there?

01:49:48.052 --> 01:49:50.043
[Woman #1]
Look at that.

01:49:50.132 --> 01:49:52.043
[Woman #2] A drag on! [Gasping]

01:49:52.092 --> 01:49:55.323
Geoff, any ideas,
because I'm getting tired?

01:49:55.412 --> 01:49:57.972
[Indistinct Chatter]

01:50:00.332 --> 01:50:02.323
Lean right.

01:50:02.412 --> 01:50:04.972
Lean right. No, left. Whoa!
You have to lean right too.

01:50:06.372 --> 01:50:10.047
Get me the king's fastest
horses. Look at that. A drag on.

01:50:13.652 --> 01:50:17.440
Four days till the coming.
This alters everything.

01:50:17.532 --> 01:50:19.363
Flap a little faster.

01:50:19.452 --> 01:50:21.682
Whoa! Too fast.
Slow down!

01:50:25.332 --> 01:50:28.608
The prophecy
must surely be true.

01:50:28.692 --> 01:50:32.082
First Friar Peter's
sudden passing, and now this.

01:50:32.172 --> 01:50:34.083
It's all my fault,
Father.

01:50:34.172 --> 01:50:37.721
[Osric]
Faster, men. Faster.

01:50:37.812 --> 01:50:40.167
[Groans] Would you loosen
up? I can hardly breathe.

01:50:40.252 --> 01:50:42.686
"Lean farther. Fly faster.
Hold looser. "

01:50:42.772 --> 01:50:46.560
- I can't think of so many things at once.
- Just slow down, will you?

01:50:46.652 --> 01:50:49.689
[Screaming]

01:50:51.452 --> 01:50:53.408
[Geoff] I think that was
a little bit too slow.

01:50:54.572 --> 01:50:58.645
[Coughing]
[Growling]

01:51:01.812 --> 01:51:03.643
We made it.
You were great.

01:51:03.732 --> 01:51:06.246
Great? Even though we
crashed? Absolutely!

01:51:06.332 --> 01:51:10.007
You are a natural. Thanks.
Uh-oh. [Men Yelling]

01:51:10.092 --> 01:51:13.926
Who's smart idea was it to scare
'em? Uh, uh, uh, start flapping.

01:51:14.012 --> 01:51:16.890
Start flapping! I can't
flap anymore. I'm exhausted.

01:51:16.972 --> 01:51:19.850
[Angry Shouting]

01:51:19.932 --> 01:51:23.447
[Growling] Watch out.
That got in my eyes.

01:51:23.532 --> 01:51:28.560
Did you see that drag on that just flew
by, headed east toward the mountains?

01:51:28.652 --> 01:51:31.610
U h, he was big,
wasn't he?

01:51:31.692 --> 01:51:35.207
Sure was fast.
Probably never see him again.

01:51:36.252 --> 01:51:38.482
Must be miles away by now.

01:51:38.572 --> 01:51:41.370
U h, he went that way.

01:51:42.492 --> 01:51:46.804
- Hold him!
- [Man] He's in there.

01:51:46.892 --> 01:51:50.202
Put those down!

01:51:50.292 --> 01:51:52.965
[Geoff] You heard him. Put those down!

01:51:53.052 --> 01:51:55.043
[Peasants Murmuring]

01:51:55.132 --> 01:51:56.963
Can't you see
this is, uh...

01:51:57.052 --> 01:52:01.364
Lord Osric, chief advisor
to the king, at your service,

01:52:01.452 --> 01:52:03.363
[Growling]
good drag on.

01:52:03.452 --> 01:52:07.161
He's a bit shy.
H is name is Drake.

01:52:07.252 --> 01:52:11.404
I'm... I mean, we-we are all
so glad to see you, Drake.

01:52:11.492 --> 01:52:13.289
And your friend here?

01:52:13.372 --> 01:52:17.285
- Geoff.
- An honor to make your acquaintance.

01:52:17.372 --> 01:52:20.648
When the king saw your
magnificent form flying overhead,

01:52:20.732 --> 01:52:23.007
he requested a favor
of service from you.

01:52:23.092 --> 01:52:25.526
- Me?
- Indeed.

01:52:25.612 --> 01:52:28.490
He wishes to appoint you
protector of the realm.

01:52:28.572 --> 01:52:31.245
Geoff here will be
adjunct protector of the realm.

01:52:31.292 --> 01:52:33.362
Is that anything
like a knight?

01:52:34.612 --> 01:52:36.443
A small step below.

01:52:36.532 --> 01:52:40.730
Oh. As you see, I was right, mi lord

01:52:41.972 --> 01:52:44.088
You two again?

01:52:44.172 --> 01:52:49.292
I thought you'd be intelligent enough
to heed my advice and leave our kingdom.

01:52:49.372 --> 01:52:51.681
- Guards.
- No!

01:52:51.772 --> 01:52:53.888
These are my friends.

01:52:57.012 --> 01:52:59.526
[Drake Growls]

01:52:59.612 --> 01:53:02.046
These people are
from far away.

01:53:02.132 --> 01:53:04.088
See how different they are? [Growls]

01:53:04.172 --> 01:53:07.847
They do not follow the old
code. Do not trust them.

01:53:07.932 --> 01:53:10.730
He is right.
We should g o home.

01:53:10.812 --> 01:53:13.724
[Gasps] Mansel. [Growling]

01:53:13.812 --> 01:53:16.167
[Woman] Oh, he's
moving! [Man] Stand back.

01:53:16.252 --> 01:53:19.847
Well, if-if they're friends of
Geoff's, they're friends of mine.

01:53:19.932 --> 01:53:22.526
[Man]
He speaks!

01:53:22.612 --> 01:53:24.682
Well, then,
they're welcome, of course,

01:53:24.772 --> 01:53:27.366
for as long as
you want them to stay.

01:53:27.452 --> 01:53:31.206
The drag on will be an enormous
help in protecting our kingdom.

01:53:31.292 --> 01:53:33.362
N ice of him to fly by
when he did.

01:53:33.452 --> 01:53:37.161
H is arrival was fate,
not courtesy, Sire.

01:53:37.252 --> 01:53:40.847
With his help, we can vanquish
the Tere goths once and for all.

01:53:40.932 --> 01:53:42.763
[Bagpipes, Out Of Tune] I need
you to give me command of the army.

01:53:42.852 --> 01:53:44.683
[Stops]
Immediately.

01:53:44.772 --> 01:53:49.084
[Continues] I'll interpret
that as your royal approval.

01:53:52.652 --> 01:53:54.404
[Mansel] You have no
idea what you've done.

01:53:54.492 --> 01:53:58.770
Of course I do. I got Drake out of that prison
that you and Friar Peter locked him in...

01:53:58.852 --> 01:54:01.810
and I taught him to fly, and I
got myself out of the stables.

01:54:01.892 --> 01:54:04.326
Only four more days. All I
had to do was keep Drake safe.

01:54:04.412 --> 01:54:06.368
Then he would have been free
to live his life, but you...

01:54:06.452 --> 01:54:08.204
Safe from what? What's
gonna happen in four days?

01:54:08.292 --> 01:54:10.123
A prophecy that says
an ancient evil...

01:54:10.212 --> 01:54:12.487
will take hold of this land
using a drag ors heart.

01:54:12.572 --> 01:54:15.484
Ancient evil? Drake?
You got the wrong drag on.

01:54:15.572 --> 01:54:17.767
He doesn't have to be evil
for evil to use him.

01:54:17.852 --> 01:54:19.843
Drake is an innocent.
He's easily misled.

01:54:19.932 --> 01:54:23.527
Don't worry. I'll protect him.
Who's going to protect him from you?

01:54:32.092 --> 01:54:33.923
[Sighs]

01:54:34.012 --> 01:54:36.082
Excuse me, miss.

01:54:40.012 --> 01:54:42.367
Put those back. This is a
monastery. We don't allow girls.

01:54:42.452 --> 01:54:44.283
[Lian] Please, no one must
know that. Hey, Mansel!

01:54:46.252 --> 01:54:49.005
You knew about her,
didn't you?

01:54:50.012 --> 01:54:53.402
Shame on you,
Mansel.

01:54:53.492 --> 01:54:57.770
Don't you remember the abbot's sermon
about that old tradition, sanitary?

01:54:57.852 --> 01:55:00.491
- Sanctuary.
- Yeah.

01:55:00.572 --> 01:55:04.326
Well, we should show her
some sanctuary.

01:55:04.412 --> 01:55:07.768
You're a monk, Mansel. That's
what monks do. All right.

01:55:07.852 --> 01:55:10.730
All right.

01:55:10.812 --> 01:55:14.202
- Don't worry. He'll keep your secret.
- Thank you.

01:55:14.292 --> 01:55:16.123
I'm glad you're moving in.

01:55:16.212 --> 01:55:19.841
The food is lousy, but the place more than
makes up for that with its lack of excitement.

01:55:19.932 --> 01:55:22.890
You want help with
those? I can handle them.

01:55:22.972 --> 01:55:26.408
I've never seen anyone fight like
you. Don't touch the ram head!

01:55:29.292 --> 01:55:31.362
Bad luck.
Oh.

01:55:31.452 --> 01:55:34.250
I've never seen anyone fight like
you. Where'd you learn to do that?

01:55:34.332 --> 01:55:36.766
Master Kwan taught me.

01:55:36.852 --> 01:55:39.002
Do all girls fight
where you come from?

01:55:39.092 --> 01:55:42.482
Do you like wearing girl's clothes, or
is that why you're dressed like a boy?

01:55:48.172 --> 01:55:50.402
Can you believe
all this fuss?

01:55:50.492 --> 01:55:52.608
That's the boy
who found the drag on.

01:55:54.412 --> 01:55:56.607
Isn't he just
a stable boy?

01:56:10.412 --> 01:56:12.482
Hey, Mansel,
have you seen Drake?

01:56:12.572 --> 01:56:14.881
All right.
I'll keep looking.

01:56:14.972 --> 01:56:16.963
Hey, you have fun,

01:56:17.052 --> 01:56:21.364
'cause it's not like gluttony is
on that seven deadly sin list too.

01:56:29.892 --> 01:56:33.601
If it isn't that fencing stable
boy at the castle at last.

01:56:33.692 --> 01:56:37.287
Well, your tunic doesn't seem
so great now, does it?

01:56:37.372 --> 01:56:40.444
You only have that tunic because
you're friends with the drag on.

01:56:40.532 --> 01:56:43.524
Without him,
you are still a peasant.

01:56:43.612 --> 01:56:45.842
Roland,

01:56:45.932 --> 01:56:49.049
Geoff's well on his way
to becoming a knight.

01:56:49.132 --> 01:56:51.009
Isn't that true, Roland?

01:56:51.092 --> 01:56:55.563
And what do you get if you don't tell
the truth in our kingdom? Ten lashes.

01:56:55.652 --> 01:56:58.405
One more word
and I'll have to double that.

01:56:58.492 --> 01:57:00.528
Come with me.

01:57:07.132 --> 01:57:08.963
You've handled
swords before.

01:57:10.012 --> 01:57:11.923
None like this.

01:57:13.452 --> 01:57:16.091
Then, shall we?
En garde.

01:57:22.452 --> 01:57:25.205
[Narrator] As the time grew
near for Kwan and Lian...

01:57:25.292 --> 01:57:28.443
to test the purity
of the drag ors heart,

01:57:28.532 --> 01:57:31.569
the gravity of what
they might have to do...

01:57:31.652 --> 01:57:34.769
weighed heavily
upon them.

01:57:34.852 --> 01:57:37.889
A shot through the heart
with this poison...

01:57:37.972 --> 01:57:41.282
will kill him
fast and clean.

01:57:41.372 --> 01:57:45.729
If he fails,
he will feel no pain.

01:57:45.812 --> 01:57:48.565
Unlike all the drag on my
great grandfather murdered.

01:57:51.332 --> 01:57:55.530
If you allow your misplaced guilt
to affect you at the pivotal moment,

01:57:55.612 --> 01:57:58.729
you will doom
us all, child.

01:57:58.812 --> 01:58:02.521
- Would you prefer if I...
- No.

01:58:02.612 --> 01:58:07.606
This is my burden.
I will do what I must.

01:58:09.172 --> 01:58:13.324
I just pray that
Drake passes this test.

01:58:28.012 --> 01:58:32.210
You have natural talent. You
deserve special attention, my boy.

01:58:34.252 --> 01:58:37.164
Perhaps you'd consider taking
rooms here at the castle.

01:58:37.252 --> 01:58:39.447
Me live here?

01:58:39.532 --> 01:58:42.569
That way, I could
tutor you personally.

01:58:42.652 --> 01:58:45.883
Where can my guards
collect Drake's belongings?

01:58:45.972 --> 01:58:50.409
Drake's? I assumed you
and him were a team.

01:58:50.492 --> 01:58:55.361
Well, I think he'd be too
scared to leave the monastery.

01:58:55.452 --> 01:58:59.365
Poor creature. We wouldn't
want to make him uncomfortable.

01:59:02.132 --> 01:59:06.728
I'm sure you can convince
him to make regular visits.

01:59:06.812 --> 01:59:09.451
I'm sure he'd
like that a lot.

01:59:09.532 --> 01:59:12.490
What do you think it would take
for a stable boy to become a knight?

01:59:12.572 --> 01:59:14.449
Now come at me faster.

01:59:14.532 --> 01:59:16.762
The most fundamental attribute
of a knight is his commitment!

01:59:16.852 --> 01:59:19.525
He should want it more than
anything else. More than wealth.

01:59:19.612 --> 01:59:22.080
More than adventure!

01:59:22.172 --> 01:59:25.130
[Exhales]
More than friendship.

01:59:25.212 --> 01:59:29.763
Do you want it that bad? Yes, I do.

01:59:29.852 --> 01:59:33.322
You'll make a positively
heroic knight.

01:59:33.412 --> 01:59:36.961
It's written...
in the stars.

01:59:47.012 --> 01:59:50.049
[Growling] This is what
I wanted you to see.

01:59:52.492 --> 01:59:57.691
It is a ritual mask based on the
most famous drag on in the East.

01:59:57.772 --> 02:00:00.570
But it...
Looks so angry.

02:00:05.652 --> 02:00:07.722
[Kwan]
This amulet...

02:00:07.772 --> 02:00:11.367
has been imbued with all the
wisdom of the ancient drag ons.

02:00:11.452 --> 02:00:13.363
If you do as I say,

02:00:13.452 --> 02:00:16.762
you will receive all that
knowledge in an instant.

02:00:16.852 --> 02:00:19.730
[Drake] I've always dreamed
of learning about drag ons,

02:00:19.812 --> 02:00:23.771
but how can I possibly
learn so much all at once?

02:00:23.852 --> 02:00:27.765
[Kwan] You must open your most
vulnerable spot, your heart,

02:00:27.852 --> 02:00:29.808
to the drag ors mouth,

02:00:29.852 --> 02:00:34.448
then touch the amulet, and
the wisdom will be yours.

02:00:34.532 --> 02:00:37.842
[Drake]
Open up my heart?

02:00:37.932 --> 02:00:40.241
Oh, you mean...

02:00:41.332 --> 02:00:44.085
like...

02:00:44.172 --> 02:00:46.163
like this?

02:00:46.252 --> 02:00:48.971
Just touch the amulet.

02:00:51.972 --> 02:00:54.167
Drake!

02:01:01.372 --> 02:01:04.250
Isn't there another way
for me to learn?

02:01:04.332 --> 02:01:07.608
L- I could teach you,
but that would take years.

02:01:11.252 --> 02:01:14.847
I don't want to touch
that thing. It's evil.

02:01:17.212 --> 02:01:19.806
[Sighs]

02:01:29.612 --> 02:01:32.763
[Gasps] What are you
doing to my drag on?

02:01:35.452 --> 02:01:39.206
Nothing. Everything is all right now.

02:01:39.292 --> 02:01:42.409
That is
most inappropriate.

02:01:42.492 --> 02:01:45.290
[Man] Get your drag on portraits!

02:01:45.372 --> 02:01:47.522
[Chattering, Laughing]

02:01:49.852 --> 02:01:52.241
Drake! Kwan said you
passed some kind of test,

02:01:52.292 --> 02:01:54.965
so he's gonna teach you
all the old drag on secrets.

02:01:55.052 --> 02:01:57.725
And I've got Osric practically
begging me to learn how to be a knight.

02:01:57.812 --> 02:01:59.689
Isn't it great?

02:01:59.772 --> 02:02:02.206
Look what I brought you from
Osric's library. [Drake] What?

02:02:02.292 --> 02:02:04.965
Books about drag ons
and knights.

02:02:05.052 --> 02:02:09.921
I do not trust him, nor
do I trust this Osric.

02:02:10.012 --> 02:02:12.606
The danger is
still great.

02:02:12.692 --> 02:02:17.925
We must stay close to the drag
on until the comet has passed.

02:02:24.412 --> 02:02:28.530
[Drake] I've seen these stars
before, through the grate in my room.

02:02:28.612 --> 02:02:30.967
They always made me
feel better somehow.

02:02:31.052 --> 02:02:34.727
Those are the stars
of the constellation Draco,

02:02:34.812 --> 02:02:38.441
the souls
of your ancestors.

02:02:38.532 --> 02:02:41.729
[Drake] Tell me more.
[Kwan] A long time ago,

02:02:41.812 --> 02:02:44.167
drag ons ruled
the earth.

02:02:44.252 --> 02:02:48.165
When people appeared, drag ons
saw their potential for good...

02:02:48.252 --> 02:02:50.561
and shared
their drag on wisdom,

02:02:50.652 --> 02:02:55.123
pledging to watch over humans
and help them grow.

02:02:55.212 --> 02:02:57.487
The souls of drag ons...

02:02:57.572 --> 02:03:00.962
who fulfilled
that pledge became stars.

02:03:01.052 --> 02:03:03.361
Their spirits are
still up there...

02:03:03.452 --> 02:03:07.206
comforting anyone
who cares to look.

02:03:07.292 --> 02:03:10.045
Like a drag on heaven. [Kwan] Exactly.

02:03:10.132 --> 02:03:13.408
The last soul to join
was a mighty drag on...

02:03:13.492 --> 02:03:15.323
who shared his heart
with a prince...

02:03:15.412 --> 02:03:17.607
who was wounded
in battle.

02:03:17.692 --> 02:03:21.048
While the drag on lived,
the prince was invincible,

02:03:21.132 --> 02:03:23.965
sharing the drag ors strength... Really?

02:03:24.052 --> 02:03:26.566
And his every pain.

02:03:26.652 --> 02:03:30.565
Oh. [Kwan] A drag on
must be very cautious...

02:03:30.652 --> 02:03:32.768
before sharing his heart.

02:03:32.852 --> 02:03:35.605
If the humans heart
is a corrupt one,

02:03:35.692 --> 02:03:38.411
the drag on can lose
his place in heaven...

02:03:38.492 --> 02:03:42.087
forever. [Drake] That's awful.

02:03:42.172 --> 02:03:46.723
[Growling] [Geoff] Drake, look at this.

02:03:46.812 --> 02:03:48.803
[Drake] Why is that
drag on chewing on a cow?

02:03:48.892 --> 02:03:51.042
Looks like dinner
to me.

02:03:51.132 --> 02:03:53.851
[Drake]
Dinner? Hmm.

02:03:55.612 --> 02:03:58.649
Come along, girl.

02:04:05.172 --> 02:04:07.003
[Cow Mooing]

02:04:07.092 --> 02:04:09.970
Where'd you g o?

02:04:10.052 --> 02:04:13.124
[Moans]

02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:17.125
My cow.

02:04:17.212 --> 02:04:20.045
[Lian Yells]

02:04:23.132 --> 02:04:25.771
[Lian Laughing]
Not bad for your first lesson.

02:04:25.852 --> 02:04:28.241
Now attack me again.

02:04:28.332 --> 02:04:30.402
When exactly do I
get to throw you?

02:04:30.732 --> 02:04:32.529
[Do g Barking]
Geoff!

02:04:34.332 --> 02:04:37.608
Sorry I'm late.
[Burps]

02:04:37.692 --> 02:04:40.365
- Excuse me.
- Oh. Cow breath.

02:04:40.452 --> 02:04:43.888
- [Drake] What are you gonna teach me first, Master Kwan?
- Teach him to blow fire now.

02:04:43.932 --> 02:04:46.287
No, breathing fire
is dangerous.

02:04:47.892 --> 02:04:53.489
[Groans] Stop being such a monk, Mansel.

02:04:53.532 --> 02:04:55.648
How does
he breathe fire?

02:04:55.732 --> 02:05:00.248
[Kwan] First, you must
learn to open your fire lung.

02:05:00.332 --> 02:05:02.527
inhale through
your nose...

02:05:02.612 --> 02:05:06.571
and concentrate on passing
the air deep in your throat.

02:05:06.652 --> 02:05:10.247
Fill your lungs.
It will sound like this.

02:05:10.332 --> 02:05:12.163
[Snoring Sound]

02:05:20.852 --> 02:05:22.683
You try.

02:05:25.972 --> 02:05:29.123
Something's wrong.

02:05:29.212 --> 02:05:33.046
Get down. Turn that way
so you don't hit the mill,

02:05:33.132 --> 02:05:36.044
then let it
all out!

02:05:45.172 --> 02:05:47.208
[People Screaming]
[Do g Barking]

02:05:47.292 --> 02:05:49.169
[Explosion]

02:05:54.812 --> 02:05:58.885
You can call him protector of the
realm, but he destroyed my mill!

02:05:58.972 --> 02:06:02.567
He can't g o 'round plucking up
cows and flying off with them.

02:06:02.652 --> 02:06:04.643
[Osric] I can see you're
both very distressed.

02:06:04.732 --> 02:06:07.690
I'm glad you came directly to
me about this. Fix your mill.

02:06:07.772 --> 02:06:11.208
Buy yourself a new cow, and remember:

02:06:11.292 --> 02:06:14.170
Our drag on is the last
of a magnificent race.

02:06:14.252 --> 02:06:17.722
He deserves our utmost respect. Hmm?

02:06:21.212 --> 02:06:25.125
Drag on lover.

02:06:25.212 --> 02:06:27.851
Peasants. Pay them
no bother, lad.

02:06:27.932 --> 02:06:31.208
Small minds see what they wish and
require guidance to understand the truth.

02:06:31.292 --> 02:06:34.090
Now, let us g o outside
and see Drake...

02:06:34.172 --> 02:06:37.050
so you can both tell me what
really happened at the mill, hmm?

02:06:37.132 --> 02:06:40.727
Drake didn't want to come.
He's too embarrassed.

02:06:40.812 --> 02:06:45.169
Kwan tried to teach him how to blow
fire, but it came out the other end.

02:06:46.892 --> 02:06:48.803
You left him
with Kwan.

02:06:48.892 --> 02:06:51.804
And what else does the old
man plan on teaching Drake?

02:06:51.892 --> 02:06:53.928
I don't know exactly.

02:06:54.012 --> 02:06:58.085
Something about all the wisdom
of the ancient drag ons, I think.

02:06:58.172 --> 02:07:02.563
Bring the old man to me at once.
Yes, my Lord. It shall be done.

02:07:02.652 --> 02:07:06.247
[Drake] No. No, no. This can't be right.

02:07:06.332 --> 02:07:08.971
All these knights are-are
hurting drag ons.

02:07:09.052 --> 02:07:10.883
[Geoff]
Drake!

02:07:10.972 --> 02:07:15.045
Sorry I didn't come home last
night, but look what Osric gave me.

02:07:15.132 --> 02:07:17.441
We-Weren't we supposed
to g o flying this morning?

02:07:17.532 --> 02:07:22.606
Well, Osric has a lot to teach
me if I'm gonna become a knight.

02:07:24.572 --> 02:07:26.403
We'll fly tomorrow. [Drake] Geoff,

02:07:26.492 --> 02:07:30.326
you don't plan to be like the
knights in this book, do you?

02:07:30.412 --> 02:07:33.245
Sure. Just like them. Come on.

02:07:33.332 --> 02:07:36.369
Kwan and Lian are gonna
teach you something new today.

02:07:48.412 --> 02:07:51.006
Is there something wrong
with the air up here?

02:07:51.092 --> 02:07:54.402
Well, if Friar Peter had ever let you open
your shutters in the winter, you'd know.

02:07:54.492 --> 02:07:57.768
- It's fog.
- Friar Peter didn't want him to catch cold.

02:07:57.852 --> 02:08:00.810
We should g o back to the
monastery before Drake gets sick.

02:08:00.892 --> 02:08:03.770
Breathing ice is
an old drag on secret...

02:08:03.852 --> 02:08:06.002
that few were able
to master.

02:08:07.052 --> 02:08:09.805
That's him.
This way.

02:08:09.892 --> 02:08:12.326
You have a sense
of your fire lung now.

02:08:12.412 --> 02:08:14.721
Your ice lung
is beside it.

02:08:14.812 --> 02:08:17.485
Do you know how
to generate sputum?

02:08:17.572 --> 02:08:20.166
What? He means do you know how to spit?

02:08:20.252 --> 02:08:22.971
Well, then why didn't
he say so?

02:08:25.012 --> 02:08:26.843
Like this, Drake.

02:08:29.812 --> 02:08:32.326
- Ah.
- That's very good.

02:08:32.412 --> 02:08:37.440
Sputum expelled with air from
your ice lung will come out frozen.

02:08:37.532 --> 02:08:41.207
- Sounds simple to me.
- You don't even have an ice lung.

02:08:41.292 --> 02:08:43.328
I don't have wings, but
I figured out how to land.

02:08:43.412 --> 02:08:46.563
I will not stand by and let
you berate him like that.

02:08:46.652 --> 02:08:49.405
What are you gonna do, Mansel?
Whip me with your tassel?

02:08:49.492 --> 02:08:53.610
- [Drake] I can't make spit.
- Just suck on your tongue, but don't swallow.

02:08:57.452 --> 02:09:00.012
Oh, come on!
You did that on purpose!

02:09:00.092 --> 02:09:02.003
[Drake] I got some spit in my mouth.

02:09:02.092 --> 02:09:05.801
Open your ice lung
and blow!

02:09:08.892 --> 02:09:12.282
- Mansel, duck!
- What?

02:09:13.612 --> 02:09:16.001
Oh, no.
I've killed him.

02:09:16.092 --> 02:09:18.401
Mansel?

02:09:18.492 --> 02:09:22.246
Are you
all right?

02:09:22.332 --> 02:09:25.290
I'm going back to the monastery
before I catch my death.

02:09:25.372 --> 02:09:28.444
Here. Take my coat. Thank you.

02:09:34.972 --> 02:09:38.521
Got to get my anger under control,
or something bad's going to happen.

02:09:38.612 --> 02:09:40.443
[Groans]

02:09:48.292 --> 02:09:50.123
[Groaning Continues]

02:09:50.212 --> 02:09:52.123
You're coming with us,
old man.

02:09:54.332 --> 02:09:57.290
[Lian] Drake is pretty disappointed.
[Geoff] He shouldn't be.

02:09:57.372 --> 02:10:01.251
Didrt Kwan say that most drag
ons can't breathe ice? Geoff.

02:10:01.332 --> 02:10:03.846
Geoff, he is
disappointed in you.

02:10:03.932 --> 02:10:07.971
In me? Why, 'cause I didn't g
o flying with him this morning?

02:10:08.052 --> 02:10:09.883
I have more important things
to do if I'm gonna be...

02:10:09.972 --> 02:10:12.964
Don't you know what a miracle
it is Drake even exists?

02:10:17.692 --> 02:10:20.490
Years ago,
a drag on named Griffin...

02:10:20.572 --> 02:10:23.530
led a rebellion
against our imperial city.

02:10:23.612 --> 02:10:26.490
When virtuous drag ons
captured Griffin,

02:10:26.572 --> 02:10:31.487
they took his heart as
punishment and placed it in here.

02:10:33.332 --> 02:10:37.245
This is the withered heart of the
betrayer of the drag on pledge.

02:10:37.332 --> 02:10:39.163
[Geoff]
That's a drag ors heart?

02:10:39.252 --> 02:10:43.006
The virtuous drag ons brought this
amulet to the Emperor Kuo-fan...

02:10:43.092 --> 02:10:46.721
as proof that
the evil had been destroyed.

02:10:46.812 --> 02:10:49.451
But by then,
the emperor was too fearful.

02:10:49.532 --> 02:10:53.411
He killed every drag on
in the East.

02:10:54.852 --> 02:10:58.208
Drake is the last
of his kind.

02:10:58.292 --> 02:11:03.002
He is more alone than you
could possibly imagine.

02:11:09.692 --> 02:11:11.523
[Man]
Now watch again closely.

02:11:11.612 --> 02:11:15.082
Toss smooth and easy.
Like this.

02:11:17.692 --> 02:11:19.569
Now try it again,
Sire.

02:11:26.532 --> 02:11:29.285
Better every day, Sire. [Chuckles]

02:11:29.372 --> 02:11:32.762
- Now open wide.
- My Lord.

02:11:32.852 --> 02:11:35.685
[Osric]
Ah, Master Kwan.

02:11:35.772 --> 02:11:39.321
How nice of you to visit. If you
could just stay there for a moment,

02:11:39.412 --> 02:11:42.882
I have some vital affairs
to discuss with the king.

02:11:44.732 --> 02:11:48.168
That's enough of your
dalliance for tonight.

02:11:48.252 --> 02:11:51.005
Now put your
official seal on this.

02:11:51.092 --> 02:11:53.287
What is this? An order
of succession, Sire,

02:11:53.372 --> 02:11:56.808
granting me your lands and powers in the
unlikely event of your premature death.

02:11:56.892 --> 02:11:59.804
Oh, is that all?

02:12:06.572 --> 02:12:08.403
Now off to bed
with you.

02:12:08.492 --> 02:12:10.801
Good night, Osric.

02:12:10.892 --> 02:12:14.043
Sleep well, my King.

02:12:14.132 --> 02:12:17.522
Tomorrow's
an important day.

02:12:17.612 --> 02:12:21.287
For when the comet arrives,
this charade will end.

02:12:21.372 --> 02:12:25.206
Oh, yes, Master Kwan! Stefan,
how could you be so rude?

02:12:25.252 --> 02:12:28.050
Take that old sack
off our honored guest's head.

02:12:30.252 --> 02:12:32.322
I guess you weren't
expecting me.

02:12:32.412 --> 02:12:34.243
My mistake.
I'll take care of it.

02:12:34.332 --> 02:12:36.766
Ah.

02:12:39.412 --> 02:12:42.563
You've served me loyally
for many years.

02:12:42.652 --> 02:12:45.120
Is that not right, Stefan? Yes, sir.

02:12:45.212 --> 02:12:47.772
And in all that time, have
you ever made a mistake before?

02:12:47.852 --> 02:12:49.729
No, my Lord.

02:12:49.812 --> 02:12:52.167
[Osric]
Watch closely, monk.

02:12:53.492 --> 02:12:56.086
[Stefan Moaning]

02:13:02.012 --> 02:13:03.843
I won't tell.

02:13:03.932 --> 02:13:07.766
I swear by the Holy Rood
I won't say a thing.

02:13:07.852 --> 02:13:10.241
That's right.
Just like your king.

02:13:10.332 --> 02:13:13.449
You won't say
a single coherent thing.

02:13:20.092 --> 02:13:22.606
Now off to the dung eon with
you like a good, little monk.

02:13:28.252 --> 02:13:30.129
It's hot in here.

02:13:37.452 --> 02:13:41.127
You are all incompetents!

02:13:41.212 --> 02:13:44.602
I must do this
myself.

02:13:44.692 --> 02:13:48.287
Take the guards to the monastery for
Kwan. I'll meet you there with my knights.

02:14:14.812 --> 02:14:20.125
Tonight will bring
an end to our deceptions.

02:14:21.332 --> 02:14:25.689
This disguise has
served me well.

02:14:25.772 --> 02:14:28.491
I am comfortable here.

02:14:30.852 --> 02:14:32.729
Morning.

02:14:34.972 --> 02:14:37.281
New trouble approaches.

02:14:40.332 --> 02:14:42.163
[Horses Whinnying]

02:14:46.412 --> 02:14:49.529
[Man] All of us for
one old man and a boy?

02:14:51.532 --> 02:14:53.409
The old man and his son
are coming with us.

02:14:53.492 --> 02:14:56.211
This has to be some kind of a
mistake. I'll g o talk to Osric.

02:14:56.292 --> 02:15:01.082
- You're not in charge here, squire.
- We shall be g one tomorrow.

02:15:01.172 --> 02:15:03.049
You'll be g one now!

02:15:08.732 --> 02:15:11.451
[Yelling]

02:15:56.052 --> 02:15:58.327
[Chuckles]

02:16:03.772 --> 02:16:05.683
[Yells]

02:16:22.652 --> 02:16:26.645
I might have known you'd end up with
the rest of the "swillage," stable boy.

02:16:42.332 --> 02:16:45.165
- Go to the can't. Pull the ram's head.
- [Yelling Continues]

02:16:47.052 --> 02:16:49.850
[Man]
Regroup! Regroup!

02:17:01.852 --> 02:17:03.922
[Yelling]

02:17:05.652 --> 02:17:08.962
- [Whinnying]
- Stop this at once!

02:17:09.052 --> 02:17:10.929
Told you it was
a mistake.

02:17:12.451 --> 02:17:14.567
There is no mistake.

02:17:14.652 --> 02:17:18.088
Until the comet is passed, Kwan and his
ward will be my guests at the castle.

02:17:18.172 --> 02:17:21.164
No. We must stay
with Drake.

02:17:21.252 --> 02:17:23.368
But I thought you said... [Osric] Geoff.

02:17:25.092 --> 02:17:27.844
These people are not
like you and me.

02:17:27.932 --> 02:17:31.242
What do we really know
of their intentions?

02:17:32.852 --> 02:17:36.003
This is in Drake's
best interest.

02:17:36.092 --> 02:17:38.844
Don't you agree?

02:17:40.252 --> 02:17:42.288
All right.

02:17:43.572 --> 02:17:47.531
Um-hmm. [Man] Come on. Let's g o.

02:17:47.611 --> 02:17:49.442
You too.

02:17:53.611 --> 02:17:56.728
Now, where is Drake?

02:17:56.812 --> 02:18:00.088
It's time for him to assume his
responsibilities as protector of the realm.

02:18:00.172 --> 02:18:02.561
The Tere goths have attacked
our border house.

02:18:03.732 --> 02:18:08.169
All the knights of the
realm... are needed.

02:18:12.572 --> 02:18:15.450
[Yelling]

02:18:15.531 --> 02:18:20.162
[Osric] Onward, men! To defend
the country and the old code!

02:18:27.932 --> 02:18:30.048
Come on, you!

02:18:45.052 --> 02:18:48.647
I'm hot. Does the abbot know
how hot it is down here?

02:18:48.732 --> 02:18:52.964
Probably doesn't care. Old bully
never lets anyone do what they want.

02:18:53.052 --> 02:18:56.169
Well, I'll talk
as loud as I can!

02:18:56.252 --> 02:19:00.564
Shh. Got to be quiet
all the time.

02:19:00.652 --> 02:19:04.200
[Cackling]
[Yells]

02:19:08.092 --> 02:19:10.731
I know you.

02:19:12.252 --> 02:19:15.927
Did you know
your son is a girl?

02:19:16.012 --> 02:19:18.924
They don't allow girls
in the monastery.

02:19:19.012 --> 02:19:22.799
But I won't tell if
you don't. I like girls.

02:19:26.332 --> 02:19:28.163
Hmm.

02:19:37.572 --> 02:19:39.642
[Growls]

02:19:42.252 --> 02:19:44.924
Geoff, I don't like
the looks of this.

02:19:45.012 --> 02:19:48.004
This is exactly the kind of
adventure we've been talking about.

02:19:48.092 --> 02:19:51.368
Drake, this is my big
chance. Don't let me down.

02:19:51.452 --> 02:19:53.568
[Osric] Drake, stay
here and guard our backs.

02:19:53.652 --> 02:19:56.962
Be careful, Geoff.

02:20:15.212 --> 02:20:18.488
Follow me.
Stay close.

02:20:39.852 --> 02:20:43.765
The Tere goths killed
our border guards.

02:21:07.732 --> 02:21:12.248
Quiet.
Something's wrong.

02:21:14.932 --> 02:21:16.888
Ambush!

02:21:16.972 --> 02:21:19.042
[Yelling]

02:21:37.172 --> 02:21:39.732
Geoff!

02:21:41.532 --> 02:21:44.569
No!

02:22:11.772 --> 02:22:13.603
[Yelling Continues]

02:22:27.932 --> 02:22:31.368
[Screaming]

02:22:32.652 --> 02:22:36.167
Excellent job.

02:22:36.252 --> 02:22:39.210
[Horse Whinnying]
Geoff! Look out!

02:22:39.292 --> 02:22:42.011
No!

02:22:55.052 --> 02:22:56.883
[Breathing Heavily]

02:23:04.652 --> 02:23:07.769
Geoff,

02:23:07.852 --> 02:23:11.003
tell Drake
to give me his heart.

02:23:13.372 --> 02:23:16.887
[Growling]
How bad is he hurt?

02:23:21.652 --> 02:23:23.483
You've got to share
your heart with him.

02:23:23.572 --> 02:23:25.881
Are you sure?

02:23:25.972 --> 02:23:30.523
- Hurry. He's dying.
- He saved your life. I'll try.

02:23:39.292 --> 02:23:41.760
[Growling]

02:23:52.732 --> 02:23:54.688
Wait! Stop!

02:23:54.772 --> 02:23:57.570
- What?
- Something's wrong.

02:23:57.652 --> 02:24:00.485
He's not really hurt.
He set us up.

02:24:00.572 --> 02:24:04.611
- [Grunts]
- [Osric] Grab him!

02:24:04.692 --> 02:24:07.047
- I would have knighted you tonight.
- [Drake] Let him g o!

02:24:07.132 --> 02:24:10.204
But there's no valor in
you, stable boy. [Drake] No!

02:24:10.292 --> 02:24:12.328
No! Don't hurt him! Give me your heart,

02:24:12.412 --> 02:24:15.529
or he dies.

02:24:15.612 --> 02:24:19.446
- [Yelling]
- [Drake] Come on, Geoff! Run!

02:24:19.532 --> 02:24:24.322
After them!

02:24:24.412 --> 02:24:27.210
Let's g o!

02:24:27.292 --> 02:24:30.364
- Oh, no.
- [Man] He's down!

02:24:30.452 --> 02:24:32.966
Geoff, get down!

02:24:45.212 --> 02:24:47.965
Whoa.

02:24:48.052 --> 02:24:52.284
It is my destiny
to become king...

02:24:52.372 --> 02:24:54.522
and rule over man.

02:24:54.612 --> 02:24:59.242
By all the stars in heaven, I
will have that heart tonight!

02:25:01.692 --> 02:25:04.525
[Humming]

02:25:17.652 --> 02:25:19.483
[Burps]

02:25:27.252 --> 02:25:29.720
[Humming Continues]

02:25:34.332 --> 02:25:37.165
Who are you? How did you get in here?

02:25:38.932 --> 02:25:41.810
I just woke up
and was here.

02:25:44.892 --> 02:25:47.360
Where's the monk and
the boy and the old man?

02:25:47.452 --> 02:25:49.886
Shh.
U h, who?

02:25:49.972 --> 02:25:51.963
[Man]
Come here!

02:25:52.052 --> 02:25:54.566
Put your hands
through the bars.

02:26:17.972 --> 02:26:20.611
[Chuckles]

02:26:20.692 --> 02:26:23.331
Come on. They need us at the front gate.

02:26:27.292 --> 02:26:29.123
Mansel!

02:26:40.252 --> 02:26:43.085
Hello?
[Chuckles]

02:26:43.172 --> 02:26:47.643
Do you have the ingredients
to brew an antidote? Yes.

02:26:47.732 --> 02:26:52.806
Black lotus. He must
have been to the Orient.

02:26:52.892 --> 02:26:57.283
You were right not to
trust Osric... and the boy.

02:26:57.372 --> 02:27:01.923
Though it was insolent of me to
point it out so boldly, Highness.

02:27:03.452 --> 02:27:06.364
You haven't called me that
in a long time, Master Kwan.

02:27:06.452 --> 02:27:10.206
Oh, you will grow accustomed
to it again soon enough.

02:27:10.292 --> 02:27:12.601
Drink this, Mansel.

02:27:17.692 --> 02:27:20.160
This way, Sire.

02:27:20.252 --> 02:27:22.083
[Humming]

02:27:22.172 --> 02:27:27.087
What's that sound? It's
music. I like music.

02:27:27.172 --> 02:27:30.608
[Man] You're not supposed
to be... [Groaning]

02:27:33.612 --> 02:27:35.443
Highness.

02:27:37.372 --> 02:27:39.840
But have I not had
my medicine?

02:27:39.932 --> 02:27:42.730
This is
a new potion, Highness.

02:27:42.812 --> 02:27:46.327
It will clear
your head.

02:27:56.772 --> 02:27:58.842
[Man #1]
Surround 'em!

02:27:59.172 --> 02:28:00.924
[Man #2]
Take this side.

02:28:08.932 --> 02:28:11.844
You came here looking for
the drag on and found him.

02:28:11.932 --> 02:28:14.571
Now, I must find him, and
time grows short. Where is he?

02:28:14.652 --> 02:28:18.611
I have been your honored guest
all day. How could I possibly know?

02:28:23.252 --> 02:28:25.368
A girl.

02:28:26.812 --> 02:28:29.724
- You look familiar.
- Perhaps you met one of my relative...

02:28:29.812 --> 02:28:32.531
while you were gathering
herbs to poison your king.

02:28:35.252 --> 02:28:40.201
The amulet of the
Chinese emperor, Kuo-fan.

02:28:45.172 --> 02:28:47.640
[Kwan]
I understand now.

02:28:49.012 --> 02:28:51.924
- So, it is you!
- Who, Master Kwan?

02:28:52.012 --> 02:28:53.843
I n the flesh.

02:28:56.092 --> 02:28:58.003
Throw the amulet
in the fire!

02:28:58.092 --> 02:29:00.481
[Yelling]

02:29:37.852 --> 02:29:41.686
I thought
this was destroyed.

02:29:44.372 --> 02:29:48.331
Daughter of the house
of Kuo-fan.

02:29:48.412 --> 02:29:52.405
On the night
of my destiny,

02:29:52.492 --> 02:29:55.848
I repay you
for your ancestor's sins!

02:29:55.932 --> 02:29:58.571
No!

02:29:58.652 --> 02:30:01.849
[Gasps]

02:30:14.012 --> 02:30:18.528
I have...
failed you.

02:30:18.612 --> 02:30:21.684
Kwan, now shh.

02:30:21.772 --> 02:30:25.651
You are
my loyal servant,

02:30:25.732 --> 02:30:28.405
my wise master...

02:30:28.492 --> 02:30:31.052
and my closest friend.

02:30:45.612 --> 02:30:48.080
[Sniffling]

02:30:51.292 --> 02:30:52.281
[Geoff]
Hurry, Drake!

02:30:57.332 --> 02:31:00.005
The prodigal
drag on returns.

02:31:00.092 --> 02:31:02.686
You'll be pleased to know
you can keep your heart...

02:31:02.772 --> 02:31:07.482
as the little empress here was
kind enough to provide me with this.

02:31:07.572 --> 02:31:10.086
Murderer! He killed Master
Kwan, and he's about...

02:31:10.172 --> 02:31:12.242
Silence!

02:31:14.212 --> 02:31:19.684
Kuo-fan was the murderer, as was Bowen!

02:31:19.772 --> 02:31:23.526
Bowen was a knight
of the old code.

02:31:23.612 --> 02:31:29.130
I've shown you the true
meaning of the old code.

02:31:29.212 --> 02:31:34.491
It's a way to control
people weaker than you!

02:31:34.572 --> 02:31:39.851
No, Bowers real legacy was
written in the blood of drag ons.

02:31:39.932 --> 02:31:43.049
But one solitary drag on...

02:31:43.132 --> 02:31:48.206
escaped Bowers wrath
and fled to the East,

02:31:48.292 --> 02:31:51.489
a drag on who learned that
the pledge to serve mankind...

02:31:51.572 --> 02:31:55.042
was nothing more
than a cruel joke!

02:31:56.532 --> 02:32:00.081
Oh, oh, he sought
his revenge,

02:32:01.492 --> 02:32:04.962
but in the end,
his heart too was...

02:32:06.092 --> 02:32:08.162
plundered,

02:32:12.572 --> 02:32:16.360
and he...
was cursed...

02:32:19.452 --> 02:32:21.408
to live out his life...

02:32:24.452 --> 02:32:27.125
in the form
he hated most:

02:32:33.452 --> 02:32:35.363
As a man!

02:32:36.612 --> 02:32:38.728
[Drake Growls]

02:32:38.812 --> 02:32:40.882
But tonight...

02:32:43.812 --> 02:32:46.963
Tonight that curse
is ended.

02:32:48.012 --> 02:32:50.810
[People Gasping]

02:32:50.892 --> 02:32:53.770
[Heart Beating]

02:33:04.252 --> 02:33:08.803
- [Rumbling]
- The heart of the prophecy was never Drake's.

02:33:08.892 --> 02:33:10.883
It was Griffirs.

02:33:39.972 --> 02:33:43.203
Drake, child.
Come.

02:33:43.292 --> 02:33:46.409
There's another drag on?
[Griffin] Little brother,

02:33:46.492 --> 02:33:51.361
we must teach mankind
their place as our servants.

02:33:51.452 --> 02:33:55.764
Come to me, and we'll fulfill
the comet's prophecy together.

02:33:55.852 --> 02:33:59.288
Y
- You called me brother. [Griffin] Come.

02:33:59.372 --> 02:34:01.932
I'll teach you what it
really means to be a drag on.

02:34:02.012 --> 02:34:04.526
- Drake, don't g o!
- That's it, brother!

02:34:04.612 --> 02:34:07.365
Geoff, I'm not alone.
Drake, listen to me!

02:34:07.452 --> 02:34:10.489
I know that I hurt you,
and I'm sorry,

02:34:10.532 --> 02:34:14.207
but he's going to enslave mankind
forever. Get out of Drake's way!

02:34:17.452 --> 02:34:19.522
Geoff! [Drake] Geoff!

02:34:19.612 --> 02:34:24.208
If it wasn't for Geoff, I
would've given you my heart...

02:34:24.292 --> 02:34:26.760
and lost my soul.

02:34:26.812 --> 02:34:29.167
He's my real brother!

02:34:31.892 --> 02:34:35.441
Poor choice
of siblings, Drake.

02:34:54.812 --> 02:34:57.565
[Explosion]

02:35:12.732 --> 02:35:14.563
Drake, use your tail!

02:35:21.692 --> 02:35:23.444
You'll pay
for that, peasant!

02:35:27.892 --> 02:35:31.407
Ice? How did you... [Yells]

02:35:55.732 --> 02:35:57.563
Oh!

02:36:04.572 --> 02:36:07.848
Geoff!
We made it!

02:36:07.932 --> 02:36:09.888
Geoff?

02:36:13.492 --> 02:36:16.962
He's g one.

02:36:17.052 --> 02:36:18.929
Step away.

02:36:22.692 --> 02:36:26.207
Mansel,
what are the words?

02:36:26.292 --> 02:36:29.489
I offer my heart...

02:36:29.532 --> 02:36:32.365
to make you whole,
[Drake] To make you whole,

02:36:32.412 --> 02:36:35.324
[Both] Its strength to
purify your weakness.

02:36:50.492 --> 02:36:54.804
[Breathing Deeply] [Gasps] Geoff.

02:36:59.972 --> 02:37:02.725
What happened?

02:37:02.812 --> 02:37:04.643
My heart hurts.

02:37:04.732 --> 02:37:08.725
You mean our heart hurts,

02:37:10.092 --> 02:37:12.242
but it won't feel
this bad forever.

02:37:12.332 --> 02:37:16.086
[Narrator] And so, evil was vanquished,

02:37:16.172 --> 02:37:18.561
and the old code restored.

02:37:18.652 --> 02:37:21.405
Lian returned to her
royal duties for a time,

02:37:21.492 --> 02:37:23.483
while I came home
to the monastery...

02:37:23.572 --> 02:37:27.121
and was awarded guardianship
of Brother Gilbert's scrolls.

02:37:27.212 --> 02:37:31.922
A life of prayer
and devotion was mine at last,

02:37:31.972 --> 02:37:34.770
but it was a great deal
quieter than I remembered.

02:37:34.812 --> 02:37:37.280
As for Geoff
and Drake,

02:37:37.372 --> 02:37:40.967
they finally had what they'd
really wanted from the start.

02:37:42.012 --> 02:37:45.721
A brother,
a family.

02:38:05.652 --> 02:38:10.521
See the surs
last glimmering ray

02:38:10.612 --> 02:38:16.050
Fading fast
to end our day

02:38:16.132 --> 02:38:21.445
Though I long
for you to stay

02:38:21.532 --> 02:38:26.242
Spirits call
and you obey

02:38:26.332 --> 02:38:31.850
You'll fly far
from me

02:38:31.932 --> 02:38:36.926
Though in truth
you're still home

02:38:37.012 --> 02:38:42.132
Sail across the sea

02:38:42.212 --> 02:38:44.487
Nature blooms

02:38:44.572 --> 02:38:48.008
Where you roam

02:38:48.092 --> 02:38:50.845
When trees grow

02:38:50.932 --> 02:38:53.571
The leaves show

02:38:53.652 --> 02:38:58.646
My heart goes
with you

02:39:07.172 --> 02:39:12.166
Hear the hush
where'er you si gh

02:39:12.252 --> 02:39:17.280
Sorrow weeps
down from the sky

02:39:17.372 --> 02:39:23.447
Though we've whispered
our good-bye

02:39:23.532 --> 02:39:25.762
Everywhere you g o

02:39:25.852 --> 02:39:28.082
Am I

02:39:28.172 --> 02:39:33.200
From this life
you flee

02:39:33.292 --> 02:39:38.764
As the draft
grows so cold

02:39:38.852 --> 02:39:44.245
Oh, and now
you're free

02:39:44.332 --> 02:39:49.725
Feel the future unfold

02:39:49.812 --> 02:39:52.690
As winds blow

02:39:52.772 --> 02:39:55.206
The breeze shows

02:39:55.292 --> 02:40:00.650
My heart goes
with you

02:40:00.732 --> 02:40:03.451
When streams flow

02:40:03.532 --> 02:40:06.092
All shores know

02:40:06.172 --> 02:40:11.121
My heart goes
with you

02:40:16.332 --> 02:40:21.645
You'll fly far
from me

02:40:21.692 --> 02:40:23.683
Though in truth

02:40:23.772 --> 02:40:27.128
You're still home

02:40:27.212 --> 02:40:32.286
Sail across the sea

02:40:32.372 --> 02:40:34.522
Nature blooms

02:40:34.612 --> 02:40:38.082
Where you roam

02:40:38.172 --> 02:40:40.845
When trees grow

02:40:40.932 --> 02:40:43.571
The leaves know

02:40:43.652 --> 02:40:48.806
My heart goes
with you

02:40:48.892 --> 02:40:51.690
When trees blow

02:40:51.772 --> 02:40:54.411
The leaves know

02:40:54.492 --> 02:40:59.691
My heart goes
with you
