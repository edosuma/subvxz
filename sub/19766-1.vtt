00:45.345 --> 00:47.112
All right, this is what's going on.

00:47.113 --> 00:49.815
Me, O'Bizzle-- O'Bizzle.

00:49.816 --> 00:52.017
- I got it, l got it, man I'm the narrator.
- O'Bizzle fo' shizzle.

00:52.018 --> 00:54.953
Me, Peebs, and Kim.

00:54.954 --> 00:57.356
Kim, you got something to say?

00:57.357 --> 00:59.391
- Yeah, you got something to say.
- Kim?

01:00.760 --> 01:04.696
You all know tonight
is going to going to be crazy.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.565
Stupid crazy.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.767
What's your sole mission, O'Byrne?

01:08.768 --> 01:11.303
Man, to keep you out of hand.

01:11.304 --> 01:15.074
You can't-- you can't tame the beast.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.443
Peebs, tell them. How do we roll?

01:17.444 --> 01:20.579
Got 'em. Got 'em.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.282
Tune in next time
where we're going to be still loÎ½ing life

01:23.283 --> 01:26.251
and getting ready to go to war.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.253
- What?
- All right, baby.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.656
- War, Afghanistan, what?
- Say it again, baby, say it again.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.658
- I didn't even sign my passport.
- Baby.

01:32.659 --> 01:35.227
- I didn't even sign my passport.
- We're going to war. We're going to war.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.229
We're going to war. We're going to war.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.534
Roger.

02:36.556 --> 02:38.524
Oh, we're fucking hit.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.726
- This is an lED, over.
- lED.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.128
- Keep going, keep going! Keep--
- What was that?

02:43.129 --> 02:45.130
- Shots.
- Eight o'clock.

02:45.131 --> 02:47.666
- Get on that gun!
- What are we doing?

02:47.667 --> 02:50.669
Aim for that draw! Right now!

02:50.670 --> 02:52.137
That way.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.476
We gotta get out. We gotta get out of here.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.144
We're getting out!

02:59.145 --> 03:01.146
Fucking motherfucker.

03:01.147 --> 03:04.816
Shot, eight o'clock. 300 meters.

03:04.817 --> 03:08.654
Shot, eight o'clock. 102 meters.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.117
You know what?

03:39.118 --> 03:41.753
When they told me
I was going to the Korengal Valley,

03:41.754 --> 03:44.990
l really didn't, uh, I didn't read
anything up on it. l didn't want to.

03:44.991 --> 03:47.025
I wanted to go in there with an open mind.

03:47.026 --> 03:50.963
The Colonel told me initially
they take fire every single day.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.765
I was like, God, how the hell do you take
fire every single day from somebody?

03:53.766 --> 03:55.567
You got to go out there and go kill
the damn enemy.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.035
Quit being, you know, scared.

03:57.036 --> 03:58.937
Go out there and get 'em.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.740
And the Colonel and I
came up with, you know,

04:01.741 --> 04:04.443
what we thought was going to be
our campaign plan and that, uh,

04:04.444 --> 04:08.880
after two months of being there I would fix
it and that we wouldn't get shot at anymore.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.782
The very first day, l remember coming in,

05:16.783 --> 05:19.084
and one of the pilots and stuff,
and they said, hey,

05:19.085 --> 05:21.987
if you look over there to your left,
uh, that's Pakistan.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.457
You know, and we're like, you know,
we all, okay, that's Pakistan.

05:25.458 --> 05:29.861
And then they're all mountains,
you know, high elevation.

05:29.862 --> 05:33.732
And as you go in elevation,
it starts to get a little bit colder.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.070
And then we go up into the Korengal Valley.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.814
I remember looking out the little bubble
windows on the side, kind of just like this,

05:48.815 --> 05:50.982
because I was right next to the window.

05:50.983 --> 05:56.722
And I could see when the Chinook
had made a hard right turn into the valley.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.458
I was like, holy shit.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.193
We're not ready for this.

06:01.194 --> 06:05.297
We flew around for about half- hour,
45 minutes above the KOP,

06:05.298 --> 06:08.033
and you're just looking down there,

06:08.034 --> 06:11.370
and you're like,
this is in the middle of nowhere right now.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.572
You're away from everything.

06:13.573 --> 06:20.278
Honestly, when I first got to the Korengal,
I was like, this is a shit hole.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.014
My mindset was like, oh snap,
I'm going to die here.

06:26.119 --> 06:30.522
l remember getting off the bird
and walking up the hill to the hooch.

06:30.523 --> 06:34.025
Hey, Jones, you guys standing up
right there, you're wrong.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.293
Come on, guys, better get moving.

06:36.429 --> 06:40.665
And just sucking...

06:40.666 --> 06:43.034
and thinking what are we doing?

06:46.606 --> 06:52.010
It started getting dark,
and monkeys were howling,

06:52.011 --> 06:54.112
And l thought they were Taliban.

06:54.113 --> 06:58.450
And I thought, holy shit they're close.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.385
Everybody's like,
oh, you're going to the Korengal?

07:00.386 --> 07:02.320
And they feel sorry for you
and everything like that.

07:02.321 --> 07:04.423
I'm like, dude,
it can't be that bad, you know?

07:04.424 --> 07:07.492
I show up there
and you're burning your own feces.

07:07.493 --> 07:10.295
You know, you're living in a tent.

07:10.296 --> 07:14.866
I literally lived in a bunker, you know,
about that high, I couldn't even stand up in.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.869
See bullet holes all rattled into the Hescos
and when you look up, it's like,

07:17.870 --> 07:19.871
I don't even know why I have Hescos here

07:19.872 --> 07:23.708
because they're not going to stop the bullets
that are coming down from the mountains.

07:23.709 --> 07:29.514
So I felt like l was--
I was like fish in a barrel.

07:39.826 --> 07:43.795
They're gathering intel right now,
basically, on how to deal with us,

07:43.796 --> 07:48.400
because they haven't--
there's no really research or intel

07:48.401 --> 07:51.036
on how to treat us right now,

07:51.037 --> 07:56.341
because they haven't had to deal with people
like us since World War ll and Vietnam,

07:56.342 --> 07:59.277
you know, dealing with guys that are
coming back from 15-month deployments

07:59.278 --> 08:02.414
with as much fighting,
you know, as we went through.

08:24.470 --> 08:28.039
Hey, go on that ridgeline, fucking now!

08:47.860 --> 08:49.861
Hey, roger, I'm up here by OP four.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.164
We're scanning and if we have to,
we'll move into contact.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.500
I got myself, Riegel, and Thomas over here.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.969
Roger, over.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.505
Hey, I'm about to find this bastard,
and I'm going to kill him, over.

09:00.506 --> 09:03.308
Okay, roger.
So it's coming from 1705 and 00.

09:03.309 --> 09:07.913
We should be firing on those here
right now, break.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.581
Hang it!

09:09.582 --> 09:11.883
Fire! Firing!

09:31.604 --> 09:35.874
The Korengal Outpost is at the 6-3 gridline,
and then the 6-2 gridline--

09:35.875 --> 09:40.946
the insurgency has, like, drawn
this imaginary line in the sand there,

09:40.947 --> 09:42.948
and every time the guys
come out of Firebase Phoenix

09:42.949 --> 09:44.950
and they cross the 6-2 gridline,

09:44.951 --> 09:49.287
I mean, like, no shit, every time they cross
the 6-2 gridline, they get in contact.

09:49.288 --> 09:54.426
So I want to extend the security bubble,
because wherever I can place troops

09:54.427 --> 09:56.428
and wherever I can provide security

09:56.429 --> 09:59.297
is where l'm going to be able to
have an influence on the populace.

09:59.298 --> 10:04.035
The hard part is, is that they're so deeply
rooted down here because of family ties

10:04.036 --> 10:09.541
and because of religious ideals, that getting
these people to push out the insurgency

10:09.542 --> 10:13.078
and basically push out their family members
is going to be the hard part.

10:13.079 --> 10:17.515
Right now the road ends
at the Korengal Outpost,

10:17.516 --> 10:20.852
and where the road ends
is where the Taliban begins.

10:26.592 --> 10:29.894
We've been getting reports that they've been
watching us throughout the day,

10:29.895 --> 10:35.066
so the contact right now
I'd say is likely or imminent.

10:45.711 --> 10:48.546
- Good to see you.
- Move southeast. It's this way.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.882
Do you want chai?

10:50.883 --> 10:52.884
We don't have time to sit down
and have chai tonight.

10:52.885 --> 10:55.220
I just wanted to come in and talk to you
briefly about the project.

10:55.221 --> 10:58.490
How many people are you actually
going to use to build the project?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.993
What's up?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.995
You see that last house, to the right of it?

11:03.996 --> 11:07.198
Brownish fucking bush
about fucking 15, 20 meters to the right?

11:07.199 --> 11:08.333
Yeah?

11:08.334 --> 11:11.236
Someone turned around that corner,
saw us and went right back around, dude.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.685
We're going to be moving in darkness.
You're going to be lead, so...

11:26.686 --> 11:28.620
We could move now if you need to.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.439
Okay, spread out.

12:04.523 --> 12:06.758
I'm pushing up here.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.427
Whoa, a tracer came right by here!

12:15.234 --> 12:16.901
Hey!

12:16.902 --> 12:19.104
There's fire coming. They're shooting.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.905
Over there!

12:20.906 --> 12:23.241
Where? Over where?
Tell me, sir, tell me.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.176
Kim!

12:32.985 --> 12:35.854
The first friend I lost was Vimoto,

12:35.855 --> 12:38.957
and that was right at the beginning
of the deployment. That hit hard.

12:38.958 --> 12:43.795
And then a month after that, I lost Restrepo.

12:43.796 --> 12:47.298
The day that Restrepo got killed,

12:47.299 --> 12:50.201
it came across the net
that we had troops in contact.

12:50.202 --> 12:53.238
Then they called back in
and said that we have a casualty.

12:53.239 --> 12:56.040
I need you to give me fire, Cortez.

12:56.041 --> 13:01.846
We didn't know who it was, because nobody
was saying anything over the radio.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.081
When you hear someone's hit,

13:03.082 --> 13:05.283
your first reaction
is just like, fuck, like, no.

13:05.284 --> 13:10.221
And then you start going through your head
all the people that you know out there

13:10.222 --> 13:13.625
and wanting to eliminate your friends
and the people that were closest to you--

13:13.626 --> 13:17.295
you know, not this guy.
Not this guy. Not this guy.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.366
You know, your heart just sank.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.301
You were like, fuck.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.970
I mean, it was Doc Restrepo.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.442
He was shot in the neck twice...

13:33.579 --> 13:37.749
but he was stable,
so that was a relief for us.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.218
We say, okay, he's going to be okay,
because we looked at him.

13:40.219 --> 13:43.154
when he gets on the aircraft,
he's still breathing.

13:43.155 --> 13:47.525
But he, it hit his, um, artery in his neck,

13:47.526 --> 13:49.527
and he bled out.

13:49.528 --> 13:54.332
He bled out on the helicopter ride
to the emergency room

13:54.333 --> 13:57.068
where they take you when you get shot.

14:00.973 --> 14:03.708
- This is the big danger area right now.
- Okay.

14:03.709 --> 14:07.245
Because if we're here
and they start opening up on us...

14:07.246 --> 14:08.246
You're in between.

14:08.247 --> 14:13.318
But if we clear down, you guys could
use my weapons squad as an indicator

14:13.319 --> 14:15.720
for where they are,
and that's your right limit of fire, man.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.856
Shoot anything up the mountain.

14:17.857 --> 14:22.627
I would say since we haven't been down here
and we don't know what's in here,

14:22.628 --> 14:25.697
I'm going to fucking assume the worst,
because it's near Kalaygal,

14:25.698 --> 14:28.333
and that they have fortified fighting
positions throughout here.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.335
Okay.

14:30.336 --> 14:34.072
What were we doing in the Korengal?

14:34.073 --> 14:36.908
Our purpose in the Korengal--
they had a road,

14:36.909 --> 14:42.113
and the intent was this road to go through
the Korengal and go out to Chowkay Valley

14:42.114 --> 14:45.416
to be able to connect the locals

14:45.417 --> 14:49.187
where they can have an easy route
up towards the Pech River Valley.

14:49.188 --> 14:54.525
And our job there was to try
to sustain the security for the personnel,

14:54.526 --> 14:56.961
to allow them to build that road.

14:56.962 --> 15:00.331
You know, five, ten years from now,

15:00.332 --> 15:04.068
the Korengal Valley is going to have
a road going through it that's paved.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.404
And we can make more money,
make you guys richer,

15:06.405 --> 15:09.574
make you guys more powerful.
What l need though,

15:09.575 --> 15:13.945
is l need you to join with the government,
you know, provide us with that security

15:13.946 --> 15:16.681
or help us provide you guys
with that security.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.851
And I'll flood this whole place
with money and with projects

15:19.852 --> 15:22.086
and with healthcare and with everything.

15:37.903 --> 15:40.939
Remember last week when we said that
everything that happened in the past

15:40.940 --> 15:43.808
when Captain McKnight was here--
we're kind of, like, wiping the slate clean.

15:43.809 --> 15:46.044
Captain Kearney's got a new slate.

15:51.417 --> 15:55.887
Let's put it behind, and let's get on
with what we've got to do now.

16:01.560 --> 16:06.464
Growing up in Oregon, I wasn't allowed
to have sugar 'til I was, like, 13,

16:06.465 --> 16:10.735
because my mom was a fucking hippie.

16:10.736 --> 16:15.306
And she's always have us doing, like,
little hippie children things, I guess--

16:15.307 --> 16:22.847
making, like, homemade paper or painting
something or going, like, on nature walks.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.750
It was a nice childhood.
I just wasn't allowed to have toy guns

16:25.751 --> 16:28.753
or anything like that,
like boys should have, l guess--

16:28.754 --> 16:33.925
little toy guns or, like, violent video games
or watch any violent movies at all.

16:33.926 --> 16:38.997
Like l had a toy squirt gun that was
a turtle, and my parents took it away

16:38.998 --> 16:40.999
because it said "squirt gun"--
it had "gun" on there.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.934
Fire!

17:01.687 --> 17:05.089
Right now priority...

17:12.097 --> 17:16.467
For the first few months of the deployment...

17:16.468 --> 17:19.404
we'd get rocked hard. They'd hit us from...

17:19.405 --> 17:24.208
They'd ambush us at 360 degrees.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.210
I remember thinking, you know, holy shit,

17:26.211 --> 17:29.614
did everybody from the entire country
come to this valley?

17:29.615 --> 17:33.518
Is nobody else fighting anymore?
ls every bad guy in my face?

17:33.519 --> 17:37.188
Oh, shit!

17:37.189 --> 17:38.689
Motherfuckers.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.958
In the entire country of Afghanistan,

17:40.959 --> 17:46.130
we dropped something close
to 70 percent of all the ordinance.

17:46.131 --> 17:50.535
All the bombs that were dropped
at that particular time

17:50.536 --> 17:52.537
were dropped in the Korengal Valley.

17:52.538 --> 17:55.039
As CNN dubbed it one day
when Bush saw it

17:55.040 --> 17:57.442
and said, you know,
the ugliest place on Earth--

17:57.443 --> 17:59.444
the Korengal Valley.

17:59.445 --> 18:04.816
But to my family,
I never really told them much

18:04.817 --> 18:07.518
until about halfway into the deployment.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.988
I didn't tell them when Vimoto died.

18:10.989 --> 18:13.891
I didn't tell them
when Sergeant Padilla lost his arm.

18:13.892 --> 18:18.663
I didn't tell them when Pisec got shot.
I didn't tell them when Restrepo got killed.

18:18.664 --> 18:22.667
And then when Restrepo got killed was
a few days before my mom's birthday also.

18:22.668 --> 18:28.272
So I had to... I had to suck it up
when I called my mom on her birthday

18:28.273 --> 18:33.478
and act like everything was okay and say
"Hey, Mom, happy birthday," you know,

18:33.479 --> 18:36.881
like, "Yeah, I am doing really good out here,
everything's fine."

18:56.668 --> 19:01.305
The change came when we in OP Restrepo.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.842
In the middle of the night we put up
a firebase on top of the place

19:04.843 --> 19:11.482
that they had used as their enemy kinetic,
you know, point of attack,

19:11.483 --> 19:16.087
or of origin of their attack,
for the last 15 months.

19:17.723 --> 19:22.894
We walked up the Spur
with shovels and picks.

19:22.895 --> 19:27.365
We worked all though the night just
to make a small semicircle to chill in.

19:27.366 --> 19:30.935
We slept for maybe a couple hours each,
started doing it again.

19:30.936 --> 19:35.339
That day we got in five, seven firefights.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.041
Everybody good?

19:37.042 --> 19:40.611
- Yeah, we're gonna--
- Yeah!

19:40.612 --> 19:42.613
We'd dig. They'd shoot at us.

19:42.614 --> 19:45.283
They'd see us digging,
building this new place. They'd shoot.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.853
We'd shoot back. Once it lulled down,
we started digging again.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.523
When the boys built that base,

19:52.524 --> 19:57.061
the Taliban, or the AAF forces in the valley,
they were completely in shock.

19:57.062 --> 20:00.064
It was like a middle finger sticking out.

20:00.065 --> 20:06.504
And they realized once they could not knock
off OP Restrepo, we had the upper hand.

20:06.505 --> 20:09.006
They started becoming afraid.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.108
Eat some, turban head!

20:11.109 --> 20:14.011
Hey, hit the bottom right.
Hit the bottom right of the village.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.681
- Get this!
- Bottom right. Go right more.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.657
Hey, Solo, that's you.
I'm not shooting over everybody.

20:26.658 --> 20:31.062
- Let's go, let's go!
- He's down in the draw!

20:31.063 --> 20:33.064
- He's down in the draw.
- Down in the draw.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.999
How close?

20:55.454 --> 20:57.455
Buno, get your coms up.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.561
Make sure you got fucking SAW
and a.203 with you.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.831
- You're taking Wilson, Cortez.
- Cortez.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.766
Don't worry, I'll...

21:15.107 --> 21:18.643
Don't worry. There's very few
that l just straight up hope don't make it.

21:24.316 --> 21:29.353
A month or two into it, it was still
a shitty place. We were covered in dirt,

21:29.354 --> 21:35.293
digging all the time, getting in firefights,
like four or five firefights a day.

21:35.294 --> 21:41.866
And so we-- the majority of us really didn't
feel like it should be called OP Restrepo.

21:41.867 --> 21:45.036
it was just a shitty place. It was just...

21:45.037 --> 21:50.007
It just didn't resemble
the type of person that he was.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.001
Scuffing up my notes.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.947
Feels like longer than forever, yeah

22:29.948 --> 22:34.085
My home is now a distant land

22:34.086 --> 22:37.822
If l had one wish, I wish I could be

22:37.823 --> 22:41.859
Back on that rock
in the middle of the sea

22:41.860 --> 22:45.663
My heart is calling me to the islands

22:45.664 --> 22:49.967
Blue skies and tropical breeze

22:49.968 --> 22:54.071
I want to go back home

22:54.072 --> 22:57.808
Swim in the Pacific sea

22:57.809 --> 22:59.810
You can take the boy from the island

23:01.813 --> 23:03.614
But not the island from the boy

23:05.717 --> 23:07.318
The island stays in your heart

23:09.788 --> 23:17.328
I'll never forget where l'm from

23:17.329 --> 23:18.729
Oh, no, I'll never forget

23:21.733 --> 23:24.702
Where l'm from

24:00.772 --> 24:03.374
Sir. How you doing, sir?
Good to see you again.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.475
Good seeing you again.

24:04.476 --> 24:07.178
Welcome to the KOP.
I'd like to take you up over there, sir,

24:07.179 --> 24:09.880
maybe just try to give you
the once over the world here.

24:09.881 --> 24:13.184
This is the southern Korengal.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.920
This is, uh, l guess you could call it,
this is the war zone.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.922
This is where it's all happening.

24:17.923 --> 24:21.826
This is where the majority of the population
of the Korengal lives

24:21.827 --> 24:24.595
and probably about 90% of the fighting.

24:24.596 --> 24:28.632
If you look just to the south here
to that third spur that you see down there,

24:28.633 --> 24:32.970
which is called Honcho Hill, that is like
the enemy-- I guess you could say--

24:32.971 --> 24:34.972
limit of advance for us.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.241
Like, we can't go
any further south than that.

24:37.242 --> 24:38.642
- What do you call it-- Honcho?
- Honcho Hill.

24:39.911 --> 24:42.446
- Honcho Hill.
- You follow that spur,

24:42.447 --> 24:44.415
and you go all the way up here,
Sergeant Major,

24:44.416 --> 24:47.117
- and you might be able to see that--
- The tip of the...

24:47.118 --> 24:49.787
that top of the OP.
You can see all the bee huts and stuff.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.722
That's OP Restrepo.

24:51.723 --> 24:55.826
Everything south of that
is the enemy sanctuary.

24:55.827 --> 25:00.764
Battle 6, Battle 2-5,
I have around 15 up near Restrepo.

25:00.765 --> 25:04.702
Nothing out of the ordinary as far
as movement in the southwest today.

25:04.703 --> 25:09.673
Nothing but women and children
out tending to the fields and crops.

25:09.674 --> 25:15.312
Enemy assessment-- we've got the AAF
are in the final stages to start their attack

25:15.313 --> 25:18.382
and moving and getting everything in place.

25:18.383 --> 25:22.753
Last 24, conduct a movement
to contact into Loy Kalay,

25:22.754 --> 25:27.825
separate the AAF from the populace
in order to spread new lO themes.

25:44.109 --> 25:47.278
Hey, Cunningham, on a side note,
how's the fam?

25:49.681 --> 25:52.716
How's the what?

25:52.717 --> 25:54.952
- The fam.
- The family?

25:54.953 --> 25:56.554
Billy.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.822
Good. They're pretty good.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.062
Were they happy to see your crazy self?

26:05.063 --> 26:08.299
Yeah, yeah, it was a good time, man.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.968
Got to hang out at the ranch
and everything like that, you know?

26:10.969 --> 26:13.604
Got to see pretty much everyone
in the family almost.

26:16.007 --> 26:19.677
Your family owns a ranch?

26:19.678 --> 26:22.546
Of course.

26:22.547 --> 26:26.850
Like cows and pigs and chickens
and horses ranch?

26:26.851 --> 26:28.485
No.

26:28.486 --> 26:31.055
Like what kind of ranch, then?

26:38.530 --> 26:41.799
It's like a ranch
just with like land, you know,

26:41.800 --> 26:44.501
with gates and stuff and trucks and whatnot.

26:44.502 --> 26:47.771
Some guns, some wildlife,
you know, that you shoot at.

26:49.441 --> 26:53.444
Okay, so it's just a whole bunch of land
that they kill stuff on.

26:54.746 --> 26:57.815
Yeah. It's kind of like this.

26:57.816 --> 27:02.052
Yeah, but we're not hunting animals,
we're hunting people.

27:08.226 --> 27:10.227
Hearts and minds.

27:12.263 --> 27:13.764
Fucking feed tray.

27:13.765 --> 27:16.767
Yeah. We'll take their hearts,
and we'll take their minds.

27:23.708 --> 27:27.311
All right, listen up. Today we're going
to conduct a movement to contact.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.814
The purpose is to talk to the locals
about some lO themes,

27:30.815 --> 27:32.816
as far as the road construction team
coming in.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.319
Get some workers from their village
to take part in that.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.989
Talk about the cow incident.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.492
- Also...
- It was delicious.

27:41.493 --> 27:45.596
Talk about anything out of the ordinary
as far as AAF moving in through their area.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.798
See if they can give us
any information on that.

27:47.799 --> 27:50.334
Anyone have any questions?

27:53.805 --> 27:58.308
Guys, it's gonna suck, but I'm going
to work you guys into the ground.

27:58.309 --> 28:01.211
I need you guys to go out there
and do a patrol in the village

28:01.212 --> 28:03.480
because l need you to keep
the enemy off his toes.

28:03.481 --> 28:05.949
l need you to go out there
and push the enemy back

28:05.950 --> 28:07.785
so we can buy some white space,

28:07.786 --> 28:09.820
so you guys can go back up there
and work your asses off

28:09.821 --> 28:12.856
filling up these sandbags
so that you guys, when do get hit,

28:12.857 --> 28:15.459
you get hit but you got
something to hide behind.

28:15.460 --> 28:19.997
And the best defense is
who has the greater offense.

28:23.802 --> 28:25.869
3-3-4.

28:25.870 --> 28:29.339
6-1-4-9.

28:29.340 --> 28:33.077
Elevation 1-5-7-9.

28:33.078 --> 28:36.680
And we are set in Koringal.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.380
What's your father do?

29:46.217 --> 29:50.521
A shepherd? What do you do?
Are you a shepherd, too?

29:52.590 --> 29:55.159
Let me see your hands.
Your hands.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.361
He's got pretty clean hands
for being a goat herder.

30:05.770 --> 30:07.971
Where'd you get that watch, man?

30:07.972 --> 30:10.440
You guys got a lot of goats?

30:10.441 --> 30:13.310
60 goats.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.813
60 goats?
That's pretty wealthy, right, Abdul?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.447
Yeah.

30:17.448 --> 30:20.517
Well, what do you know about
the people in Kalaygal?

30:30.361 --> 30:32.362
He says...

30:38.937 --> 30:42.406
Roger, we haven't found
anybody else to talk to.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.608
We're going to start pushing back now.

30:44.609 --> 30:48.378
Hey, 2-2, this is Bravo 1.
Start pushing out towards the trail.

31:00.892 --> 31:02.893
Oh, fuck.

31:23.648 --> 31:25.816
What have they got?

31:25.817 --> 31:28.051
Oh, I guess a guy running.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.053
- A guy running?
- Yeah.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.521
Hey, Liz!

31:33.591 --> 31:36.159
Lookit. See?

31:36.160 --> 31:38.629
We've seen a guy run from that house
once or twice before.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.631
I just don't like the way it is.

31:40.632 --> 31:43.367
I don't like how it feels right now.

31:43.368 --> 31:46.169
You want him watching towards
the village or down in the draw?

31:46.170 --> 31:49.606
- Towards the back side of the house.
- Watch the back side of the house.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.316
Hey!

32:01.953 --> 32:06.456
Sit down.

32:21.706 --> 32:25.509
They found a BDU top.
I've got eyes on it right now, over.

32:30.581 --> 32:34.685
Hey, keep on searching
this whole house. Search.

32:34.686 --> 32:38.221
Yeah, yeah, like this, good. Okay.

32:38.222 --> 32:42.025
Who does this belong to?

32:42.026 --> 32:44.428
Never mind.

32:44.429 --> 32:46.563
Hey...

32:57.608 --> 33:01.044
"lf I go with you,
I'm not going to go with you right now.

33:01.045 --> 33:04.614
- I will come back to the KOP."
- No, no, he's going-- he's coming with us.

33:04.615 --> 33:06.850
This guy, he was already at the house.

33:06.851 --> 33:10.954
This guy came up later, saw us,
and starting taking off running.

33:10.955 --> 33:14.958
I got him, and ever since he started doing
what he's doing now.

33:17.695 --> 33:21.965
Hey, tell these guys I'm gonna sit them
in my truck, they need to sit on their hands.

33:25.403 --> 33:29.406
Right now what we're tracking
came in the valley on April the 11 th.

33:29.407 --> 33:35.345
There's fifteen 107-milimeter rockets,
several cases of PKM and AK ammo.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.881
The fear is always there,

33:37.882 --> 33:41.118
especially at night when you can't
see what's coming at you.

33:42.754 --> 33:48.225
When we started there, we only had
maybe fourteen guys up there.

33:48.226 --> 33:50.060
I mean, it doesn't take much.

33:50.061 --> 33:54.331
A few automatic weapons will keep,
you know, a squad pinned down,

33:54.332 --> 33:58.535
while they could easily come up
from a side and flank you

33:58.536 --> 34:01.838
and, you know, go basically clear house.

34:01.839 --> 34:04.241
Nobody's going to help you.
You're in no man's land.

34:04.242 --> 34:08.779
The KOP is only seven hundred,
eight hundred meters away,

34:08.780 --> 34:12.482
but that might as well be
in a different country

34:12.483 --> 34:14.150
because they're not getting to you.

34:15.152 --> 34:16.420
Not in time.

34:37.641 --> 34:39.376
KOP's taking indirect right now.

34:40.978 --> 34:42.312
KOP's taking indirect.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.525
Can't see shit what they're doing.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.862
Day sight. lt's something.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.197
Better than anything else we got.

35:00.198 --> 35:03.133
I need more fucking 240 here!

35:03.134 --> 35:05.435
One's by Karingal, the other's by Dallas.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.510
Right up there.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.084
The birds we love.

35:26.023 --> 35:29.526
Okay, roger, he's pretty much worked
the Honcho Hill ridge.

35:29.527 --> 35:34.698
Want to push him southeast up to 3-0,
just southeast of that.

35:41.205 --> 35:43.406
Big firefight, great.

35:43.407 --> 35:47.244
Fucking packing up rounds.
That was fun, though, man, that was fun.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.280
You can't get a better high.

35:50.281 --> 35:51.915
It's like crack, you know?

35:51.916 --> 35:54.784
You can sky dive or bungee jump
or do, you know, kayak,

35:54.785 --> 35:57.854
but once you've been shot at,
you really can't come down.

35:57.855 --> 35:59.456
There's nothing, you can't top that.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.324
How are you going to go back
to the civilian world then?

36:01.325 --> 36:02.993
I have no idea.

36:05.229 --> 36:06.696
Hey, did you hear me go cyclic?

36:06.697 --> 36:08.832
- I had the barrel smoked!
- Did you hear me?

36:08.833 --> 36:11.635
Yeah, what the fuck was that first
batch about, cuz?

36:11.636 --> 36:13.236
You was crazy as shit with that.

36:13.237 --> 36:17.240
Hey, soon as I popped my head up,
holy-- Guess who.

36:17.241 --> 36:19.509
And you just slid down the stairs.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.878
- Common game planning. l was like...
- Get down!

36:42.300 --> 36:43.934
The flight path over...

36:52.143 --> 36:53.643
He's an excellent cook,

36:53.644 --> 36:56.880
by far the best cook in the Korengal,
definitely.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.582
Came up to Restrepo one time,

36:58.583 --> 37:03.086
cooked us fresh cow,
same-day cow.

37:03.087 --> 37:04.087
That was a good day.

37:11.862 --> 37:15.298
Jonesie, you want another grill, man?
You all right?

37:15.299 --> 37:17.667
No, l don't like to fuck on a full stomach.

37:21.439 --> 37:23.807
Dude, we're on TV.

37:23.808 --> 37:28.311
Come in here for the real thing.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.680
Don't fight it, don't fight it.

37:48.065 --> 37:50.200
Why don't they mess
with you anymore, man?

37:50.201 --> 37:53.870
I was one of the first ones
that got messed with to begin with.

37:53.871 --> 37:56.072
Well, look at him, look how sexy he is.
I mean, look at this guy.

37:56.073 --> 37:58.475
He's a beautiful man.
I'd fuck him back in the States.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.639
Let's talk about the road
between Omar and Kandalay.

38:37.648 --> 38:38.882
What guy?

38:40.284 --> 38:42.085
Who did we detain?

38:42.086 --> 38:45.021
He says that you detain a guy.

38:45.022 --> 38:47.757
Haji Se, Haji Se.

38:47.758 --> 38:50.994
Naiim was dropped off

38:50.995 --> 38:55.065
by another local in Kalaygal

38:55.066 --> 38:56.866
who told us that he was bad

38:56.867 --> 39:00.503
and that he was working with Sadikula

39:00.504 --> 39:02.672
in the--

39:02.673 --> 39:06.509
what the fuck is Sadikula
in charge of, Rudy, the Mujahadeen?

39:06.510 --> 39:08.144
Yeah, he's working with the Muj.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.580
And, he was working
with the Mujahadeen.

39:10.581 --> 39:13.717
I told you guys from the very get go

39:13.718 --> 39:16.720
that if somebody says that they're bad,
I have to investigate it.

39:16.721 --> 39:19.989
So now NDS is talking to him.
He's not in jail.

39:19.990 --> 39:22.158
He's not being treated bad,

39:22.159 --> 39:24.794
he's being talked to
and asked questions.

39:24.795 --> 39:28.031
I think we've been pretty upfront
about how we handle people

39:28.032 --> 39:29.933
that we talk to and question.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.534
We've been pretty fair.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.437
l'm not like Jim McKnight
where l take all these guys

39:34.438 --> 39:37.207
and stick them in Bagram
and they never come back.

39:43.514 --> 39:46.916
He says were happy you're here,
you're doing very well,

39:46.917 --> 39:49.085
but he's saying that you detained
Mohammed Youssef before,

39:49.086 --> 39:52.389
now Mohammed Youssef
didn't come back.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.491
Rudy, who the fuck
is Mohammed Youssef?

39:54.492 --> 39:57.694
Mohammed Kalam's son,
the guy that cut the worker's heads off.

39:57.695 --> 40:00.897
That's because I saw the video
where he cut their heads off.

40:05.269 --> 40:06.870
I saw him do it.

40:09.373 --> 40:11.474
I saw him with my own two eyes.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.616
You're not understanding
that I don't fucking care.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.554
And the thing that's sad to me is that as
much as Captain Kearney go down there

40:24.555 --> 40:26.656
and conduct different Shuras

40:26.657 --> 40:30.226
and tell them about the positives
about what we can do to help them,

40:30.227 --> 40:32.028
it seemed like it didn't go anywhere.

40:32.029 --> 40:34.664
You know?
It seemed like everything that he-

40:34.665 --> 40:35.932
We took one step forward

40:35.933 --> 40:37.801
and it seemed like
they took two steps backwards.

40:57.154 --> 41:00.190
We've got three village elders
just come down and they want to talk.

41:00.191 --> 41:03.293
Not sure what they want
to talk about yet.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.761
It's a good sign.

41:04.762 --> 41:07.030
It's the first time it's happened
up here at OP Restrepo.

41:07.031 --> 41:08.231
We've had people come in--

41:08.232 --> 41:11.634
elders come in and say before
that they wanted to provide some information,

41:11.635 --> 41:14.003
but never shown up to us,
you know, come back and talk to us.

41:14.004 --> 41:17.006
So this is a positive sign.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.108
Do you hear about the cow that--

41:19.109 --> 41:21.878
- The cow?
- Yeah, the US soldiers kill it.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.513
- They killed--
- Yeah.

41:23.514 --> 41:25.648
So they came because of that.

41:25.649 --> 41:29.385
They want to get information
about the cow that--

41:29.386 --> 41:30.887
He is the owner of cow.

41:30.888 --> 41:34.190
All right, the cow?
The reason why we killed it

41:34.191 --> 41:36.926
because it ran into our constantine wire

41:36.927 --> 41:41.030
and it was mangled
inside the constantine wire,

41:41.031 --> 41:43.566
so we had to kill it
to put it out of its misery

41:43.567 --> 41:46.769
because if we would have got it out,
it would have been useless.

41:46.770 --> 41:50.206
- That's why we killed it.
- They are asking because it was illegal.

41:50.207 --> 41:52.275
- lllegal?
- Yeah, illegal.

41:52.276 --> 41:54.344
- To kill it?
- Yeah.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.383
- What do you want to do?
- Just tell them.

42:00.384 --> 42:02.318
What do they want us
to do about the cow?

42:12.930 --> 42:14.898
Do they want to be
reimbursed somehow or--

42:14.899 --> 42:19.135
He says that it is up to you,
if you want to pay money for that or--

42:19.136 --> 42:22.105
How much does a cow cost?

42:22.106 --> 42:24.274
It's going to be like four
or five hundred dollars,

42:24.275 --> 42:28.211
which is going to be twenty,
twenty five thousand Afghani, over.

42:30.347 --> 42:31.814
Did we kill this cow?

42:33.884 --> 42:37.020
Well, it was tangled up in a wire,
pretty much dead.

42:37.021 --> 42:39.956
324 ended up cutting it up. Over.

42:48.165 --> 42:51.234
We're not going to be able
to give him money in exchange for his cow.

42:51.235 --> 42:55.772
But what we can give him
is the rice, the beans, the sugar.

43:02.313 --> 43:04.314
Now, the HA that they will receive

43:04.315 --> 43:07.517
is going to be, you know,
the weight of the cow.

43:07.518 --> 43:09.485
Whatever the weight of the cow was

43:09.486 --> 43:14.223
will be the weight of return of HA
as far as rice, beans, sugar.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.138
- ls that good?
- They want money.

43:29.139 --> 43:33.276
We're not going to be able
to give them the money.

43:33.277 --> 43:36.112
If that's all he came for,
he's not going to get it.

43:43.220 --> 43:46.489
626 perstat, I have 20 at Restrepo,

43:46.490 --> 43:48.992
15 at the KOP, 4 at OP1,

43:48.993 --> 43:50.293
4 on leave,

43:50.294 --> 43:51.995
6 ANA and one terp

43:51.996 --> 43:54.230
at Restrepo, break.

43:54.231 --> 43:57.000
Talk louder, nobody
can hear you down here, over.

43:58.068 --> 44:00.503
626 perstat,

44:00.504 --> 44:02.305
I have 20 at Restrepo,

44:02.306 --> 44:03.806
15 at the KOP,

44:03.807 --> 44:05.241
4 at OP1,

44:05.242 --> 44:06.209
4 on leave,

44:06.210 --> 44:07.577
1 photo journalist,

44:07.578 --> 44:08.745
6 ANA, and 1 terp--

44:08.746 --> 44:10.246
I didn't know they had algebra two.

44:14.652 --> 44:18.054
Yeah! Burning the poop!

44:18.055 --> 44:20.423
Got the black man
on the burning the poop detail.

44:20.424 --> 44:24.160
Hey, man, just watch yourself, God damn it.

44:24.161 --> 44:28.431
Second platoon killed that cow
and now I gotta pay for it.

44:28.432 --> 44:30.967
I still wanna see Spanky
and Vaughn go at it.

44:30.968 --> 44:35.371
- Vaughn would fucking destroy Spanky.
- Let's go get him.

44:35.372 --> 44:36.539
Vaughn!

44:39.243 --> 44:41.678
Vaughn, you're going
to beat Spanky's ass!

44:41.679 --> 44:43.579
He's coming up here,
you better not lose.

44:43.580 --> 44:45.281
Dude, if you lose, so help me God.

44:45.282 --> 44:47.717
It's going to reflect poorly
on me if you lose.

44:47.718 --> 44:49.919
You better not let
that cherry bitch beat you.

44:51.121 --> 44:54.057
Make him tough.
Get him, get him.

44:54.058 --> 44:55.992
- Vaughn.
- What's up, dude?

44:59.063 --> 45:02.999
- Come on, fight back!
- You're such a little bitch.

45:07.304 --> 45:09.072
All right, go ahead.

45:09.073 --> 45:11.507
- Stretch them out.
- What the fuck, Spanky?

45:11.508 --> 45:14.143
You gonna let him
fucking manhandle you?

45:14.144 --> 45:16.946
- Let him get tired.
- Flip over, man.

45:19.316 --> 45:20.717
Yeah, there you go!

45:24.221 --> 45:25.488
Nice, there you go.

45:25.489 --> 45:26.756
You suck!

45:28.792 --> 45:31.794
Battle of the cherries.

45:31.795 --> 45:33.196
We're not talking about cherry
in the army either,

45:33.197 --> 45:34.497
we're talking about cherry at life.

45:34.498 --> 45:36.966
Vaughn here is very cherry at life.

45:36.967 --> 45:39.635
But we're making him into a man.

45:39.636 --> 45:41.738
That's all that's important here.

45:45.676 --> 45:47.944
...we talked about the road being built.

45:47.945 --> 45:50.513
Continued to hear from the elders

45:50.514 --> 45:53.616
that they don't want
to give up any workers,

45:53.617 --> 45:56.686
despite what it is that you
all have been telling me.

45:56.687 --> 46:01.657
So if you guys get these local--
that are willing to do that

46:01.658 --> 46:04.093
to come and start getting
them jobs immediately,

46:04.094 --> 46:06.629
to bypass all the elder--

46:06.630 --> 46:09.532
l don't think--
I think they're just--

46:09.533 --> 46:13.002
If we really fucked them up
like they said,

46:13.003 --> 46:15.738
then they are just chilling,
trying to recuperate.

46:15.739 --> 46:17.940
It's just like what we would be doing.

46:17.941 --> 46:21.144
You know, seven--
eight dudes wounded,

46:21.145 --> 46:23.980
I mean seven dudes wounded,
one dude dead,

46:23.981 --> 46:27.183
we wouldn't be going out strong.

46:27.184 --> 46:30.319
We'd be resting at Blessing right now.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.021
You know what I mean?

46:32.022 --> 46:36.726
That's what I think
they're doing-- resting.

46:36.727 --> 46:38.528
Are you wondering why it is so quiet?

46:38.529 --> 46:40.730
Yeah, it's got me baffled right now.

46:40.731 --> 46:42.265
Baffled or worried?

46:42.266 --> 46:44.700
Just confused.
I am at a loss for words right now.

46:44.701 --> 46:46.536
He's worried.

46:46.537 --> 46:48.104
He's worried. He's scared.

46:53.210 --> 46:54.911
Most scared.

46:54.912 --> 46:56.379
Or worried. Whatever.

46:56.380 --> 46:58.014
Yeah.

46:58.015 --> 47:00.283
I'd have to say Rock Avalanche.

47:00.284 --> 47:02.685
If l had to pick a moment,

47:02.686 --> 47:04.053
I'd probably say Rock Avalanche.

47:04.054 --> 47:08.958
Operation Rock Avalanche
was the low point for me personally.

47:08.959 --> 47:10.827
I saw a lot of professional
tough guys

47:10.828 --> 47:12.662
get weak in the knees.

47:14.631 --> 47:17.900
I'll go ahead and orient you guys
to the different LZs that are out there.

47:17.901 --> 47:21.370
Up on Divpat where the C2 element
will be located is LZ Cubs.

47:21.371 --> 47:23.906
The Taliban
or the AAF forces in the valley,

47:23.907 --> 47:26.609
they got very, very audacious

47:26.610 --> 47:30.479
and tenacious during Rock Avalanche.

47:30.480 --> 47:34.283
Physically putting their hands on soldiers,

47:34.284 --> 47:37.386
able to get so close to us
that they can kill my soldiers,

47:37.387 --> 47:39.889
steal the equipment,
and still get away.

47:39.890 --> 47:42.992
I mean...

47:42.993 --> 47:44.827
that's ballsy.

47:44.828 --> 47:48.965
We'll be releasing with Wildcat One,

47:48.966 --> 47:50.433
somewhere between Busch and Coors.

47:50.434 --> 47:52.301
Moving in on Rock Avalanche

47:52.302 --> 47:57.139
with going into areas like Yaka China
or up on the top of the Talisar.

47:57.140 --> 48:00.476
Those are areas
we haven't previously been,

48:00.477 --> 48:02.311
you know, during the deployment.

48:02.312 --> 48:05.147
North goes that way
toward Sergeant Rougle,

48:05.148 --> 48:07.850
south is this way towards me
and the First Sergeant.

48:07.851 --> 48:10.786
To go in there not ever having
laid eyes on the area,

48:10.787 --> 48:15.291
hearing the stories
about guys who'd gone prior to us

48:15.292 --> 48:17.226
getting fucked up down,
you know,

48:17.227 --> 48:19.328
in areas where they
literally shouldn't have been in.

48:19.329 --> 48:24.400
We're going to be moving out
of HLZ Cubs into HLZ Polk.

48:24.401 --> 48:26.736
ln Rock Avalanche we knew
the expectation that we was going

48:26.737 --> 48:28.070
to get engaged going up there,

48:28.071 --> 48:30.106
but we all knew that.

48:30.107 --> 48:33.609
In the location where we was actually going
to conducting this operation and stuff,

48:33.610 --> 48:36.145
was where the bad guys,
their safe haven was at.

48:36.146 --> 48:37.947
: They wasn't coming to you.

48:37.948 --> 48:40.416
Sometimes you had to go out there
and reach out to them.

48:48.959 --> 48:52.295
Go into program,
go into your radio configurations,

48:52.296 --> 48:55.665
and then where it says
SINCGARS or basic,

48:55.666 --> 48:58.668
change that to ANDVT.

49:00.070 --> 49:02.738
- Coming after you, motherfucker.
- Right here, bitch?

49:02.739 --> 49:07.176
Let's do this, motherfucker!
l'm coming back.

49:07.177 --> 49:08.577
I'm coming back, don't worry.

49:08.578 --> 49:11.113
Do you get nervous
before something like this?

49:12.783 --> 49:15.718
I get nervous for the guys.
I get nervous for myself.

49:15.719 --> 49:19.188
I mean, I just--
I just called my mom and dad

49:19.189 --> 49:21.290
and I'll try calling my wife
before I take off,

49:21.291 --> 49:23.893
just one last "I love you"
to all of them.

49:23.894 --> 49:27.530
And, you know, the guys,
that's the hardest thing is like,

49:27.531 --> 49:29.332
you know, if something happens to me,

49:29.333 --> 49:31.934
there's not much I can do
about it or anything like that.

49:31.935 --> 49:35.805
But it takes a little bit out of you

49:35.806 --> 49:39.542
every time you see one of your boys
get hurt or you lose one of them.

49:39.543 --> 49:41.410
It's really like a big family.

49:57.794 --> 50:00.396
We flew in the middle of the night.

50:00.397 --> 50:04.934
Guess what, they're not
quiet helicopters that we fly.

50:04.935 --> 50:06.335
The enemy's awake now.

50:06.336 --> 50:08.604
What the fuck are the Americans
doing flying over us right now?

50:10.941 --> 50:13.009
So now everybody's on
their radio's, l'm sure,

50:13.010 --> 50:15.511
you know, "Hey, the Americans
are heading this way."

50:15.512 --> 50:18.347
So we got on the ground
and we were already being told,

50:18.348 --> 50:21.283
be on alert, you know,
everybody knows we're here.

51:25.482 --> 51:29.151
If we could get one going
from west to east into that draw, over.

51:34.691 --> 51:35.724
It's real hot.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.894
- All right, break.
- Coming out.

51:38.895 --> 51:42.131
I'd like you to come in
for one more re-attack.

51:42.132 --> 51:47.436
Come down in elevation in that draw
and fill right there in the center, over.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.875
So you did hit the target.

51:56.646 --> 51:58.247
This house right there.

52:13.930 --> 52:17.333
This is the aftermath of what AH-64s do.

52:17.334 --> 52:19.902
Good old attack helicopters.

53:33.710 --> 53:36.912
He said that there is
five guys already dead

53:36.913 --> 53:42.785
and ten of the females and kids already,
they are injured, you know.

53:42.786 --> 53:46.021
Show me which of them is the Taliban.

53:46.022 --> 53:47.356
There is no Taliban.

53:54.130 --> 53:56.198
Damn it.

53:56.199 --> 53:57.933
You know?
I need to know better.

53:57.934 --> 53:59.668
I need to figure this stuff out better

53:59.669 --> 54:01.437
so that l can do this,

54:01.438 --> 54:03.772
so that l'm not killing these people
and not making them mad.

54:03.773 --> 54:06.242
I mean, first impressions
are the lasting impression.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.245
That's the first time anybody's been
in Yaka China, and what do l do?

54:09.246 --> 54:13.449
I kill a bunch of bad guys,

54:13.450 --> 54:16.619
but in the same instance,

54:16.620 --> 54:19.221
I'm killing five locals

54:19.222 --> 54:22.391
that may not have been
the ones that pulled the trigger,

54:22.392 --> 54:25.127
but in some way shape or form,
were connected to them.

54:29.566 --> 54:30.566
There you go.

54:48.718 --> 54:50.085
Dishka?

54:53.056 --> 54:56.358
Afghan dishka,
not American dishka, right?

55:00.096 --> 55:02.131
This is divorce paper.

55:02.132 --> 55:03.799
- What?
- Divorce paper.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.234
- Di-wars?
- Paper, yeah.

55:05.235 --> 55:06.869
- What does that mean?
- Divorce.

55:06.870 --> 55:10.172
Like some woman you getting married
then you're going to get a divorce.

55:10.173 --> 55:11.807
- Divorce papers?
- Yeah.

55:11.808 --> 55:12.975
Okay.

55:14.311 --> 55:15.978
Who owns the house?

55:21.785 --> 55:23.552
Did you ask him where the pistol was?

55:26.723 --> 55:30.726
Eight RPG heads.
One, two, three, four boosters.

55:30.727 --> 55:34.096
Got four boosters,
three batteries, shotgun.

55:57.454 --> 55:59.221
This is Colonel Ostlund,
he's my boss,

55:59.222 --> 56:00.889
you know, the one I always tell you.

56:04.994 --> 56:07.830
We brought the Colonel
down there to talk to them,

56:07.831 --> 56:11.500
and we did that because
basically we felt bad

56:11.501 --> 56:13.936
for the fact that we injured
some of their kids

56:13.937 --> 56:16.405
and that we killed
some of the locals.

56:16.406 --> 56:20.109
The ACM that comes in
and gives you five dollars

56:20.110 --> 56:21.910
to carry this stuff
around the mountains

56:21.911 --> 56:24.113
and tells you that
you're doing a jihad

56:24.114 --> 56:25.948
and go fight the Americans

56:25.949 --> 56:27.850
is doing nothing for you

56:27.851 --> 56:30.252
except making you a slave
for five dollars

56:30.253 --> 56:32.121
as he hides on a mountain,

56:32.122 --> 56:34.256
because he won't fight my soldiers.

56:34.257 --> 56:36.091
These foreigners,
they don't fight my soldiers.

56:36.092 --> 56:38.127
They hide on a mountain in a cave,

56:38.128 --> 56:40.462
under a rock and talk on a radio

56:40.463 --> 56:43.932
and pay your sons
a small amount of money

56:43.933 --> 56:46.602
to go ahead
and shoot at my soldiers

56:46.603 --> 56:48.771
and my soldiers
end up killing your sons.

56:58.014 --> 56:59.715
But this is the deal we'll make.

56:59.716 --> 57:01.383
Everybody needs a job,

57:01.384 --> 57:04.253
and we're going to try to bring
progress here and some jobs,

57:04.254 --> 57:07.389
and Captain Kearney will talk
to the Shura on Friday

57:07.390 --> 57:09.324
about some job projects.

57:15.565 --> 57:17.466
The whole time we were there,
we were thinking, "Okay.

57:17.467 --> 57:19.101
When's it coming?
When's it coming.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.036
They're going to hit us.
When's it going to happen?

57:43.560 --> 57:46.662
- This sucks, dude.
- I'm just going to double check it.

57:46.663 --> 57:49.164
ICOM chatter right now
coming out of Chappadara,

57:49.165 --> 57:51.834
a guy named Obed's talking
to the elders,

57:51.835 --> 57:56.872
and apparently said that the elders
are in charge of what's going on.

57:56.873 --> 57:59.741
The elders basically want
jihad down here in the Korengal,

57:59.742 --> 58:02.311
and whatever they want, they'll--
they're here to assist,

58:02.312 --> 58:04.546
so we'll see what happens.

58:04.547 --> 58:06.381
But it doesn't sound
very good for us, huh?

58:35.678 --> 58:37.179
Hey, Sergeant Patterson,

58:37.180 --> 58:39.414
I found four fighting positions
over there, AK-47s.

58:39.415 --> 58:41.116
I'm going to push to this next hilltop.

58:41.117 --> 58:44.253
I'm also getting ICOM traffic
that there may be enemy close to us.

58:48.491 --> 58:52.728
Getting intel saying that they've got eyes
on three to four US personnel

58:52.729 --> 58:54.596
and they're getting close to them.

59:01.237 --> 59:03.605
So they've got eyes on us
and it can be anywhere,

59:03.606 --> 59:05.207
this high ground there,

59:05.208 --> 59:06.875
there's some more spurs back there,

59:06.876 --> 59:09.611
there's one we crossed
to an open patch back there.

59:09.612 --> 59:12.414
They could have easily had eyes on us
when we were moving in.

59:20.657 --> 59:22.691
What the fuck was that?

59:24.894 --> 59:26.194
Did you hear that?

59:26.195 --> 59:27.796
It might be the birds, sir.

59:27.797 --> 59:28.997
Shooting?

59:33.202 --> 59:34.903
Am l just jumpy?

59:37.774 --> 59:41.076
Fucking Christ, monitor this.

59:59.896 --> 01:00:02.898
Sergeant P...

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:05.000
do we got guys in these
pine trees right here?

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.369
Do we?

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:28.957
When the attack finally happened,

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.860
I remember it was myself
and my team

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:35.130
on the south eastern corner

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:38.000
of basically the area
that we were covering.

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:40.068
We got ambushed, like,

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:43.872
just every single position got hit
at the same time pretty much.

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:47.409
They placed a PKM a machine gun
down into our position

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.711
and one orientated
into the scout position,

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:52.047
and just rained down hell.

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:53.715
I just look over to my right

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:56.151
and I see rounds breaking
branches off the tree.

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:59.254
They were shooting RPGs at us,

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.056
they were shooting
pretty much everything.

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:03.692
When l got hit,
it actually came

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:06.695
with enough force
that it rolled me forward.

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:10.599
You know, initial thought was,
"What happened?"

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.268
I felt pain, you know,

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.637
placed my hand there
just underneath my IBA

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.973
because that's where I felt,
you know, the initial pain,

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:21.743
pulled my hand out,
saw blood, knew l was hit.

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:24.179
I looked up in time from all fours

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.083
to watch a guy come over the crest
probably about 35-45 meters

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:31.553
to fire an RPG directly at me.

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:34.489
lnitial thought was, "Wow,
this is the last thing l'm going to see,"

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.491
because the guy was so close.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:40.896
And, you know,
the round came in, exploded.

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:44.066
Took shrapneI all throughout
my body, but...

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:46.768
kind of did--
after the explosion, like,

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:49.304
"I'm still here, I'm still alive,"

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:54.710
and then proceeded to basically roll
down the mountain into the bushes.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.145
And they were all up in position,

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:59.247
I could hear them talking to each other.

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:03.885
To our north we heard somebody
yelling for a medic.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.922
I was the first one that heard it.
I yelled back to Sergeant Hoyt,

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:09.624
telling him if I could go
and see who who it was.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:14.096
Myself along with Cortez
started moving--

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:16.465
we started bounding towards where
we heard the guy yelling from.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:17.833
We didn't know who it was.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.534
I got to the wounded and found out
it was Vandenberge.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:22.070
I yelled back it was Vandenberge
that was wounded, bring a medic.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.672
He was just bleeding real bad.

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:26.875
His whole left side of his body
was this real dark red color.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:29.578
And all he kept on saying was,
"Hey, help me, guys. Help me."

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.879
just rocking back and forth.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.649
Saying "I'm bleeding out,
you gotta save me. l'm dying."

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:36.918
Just stuff like that.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.854
Started handing him
gauze, tourniquet.

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.389
Just started packing
the wound with gauze.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.425
l had my finger
knuckle-deep in his arm.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.060
Ended up stopping the bleeding.

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.262
I'm asking,
"Where are the guys at?

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:49.531
Where's the Taliban at?
Where's the enemy at?"

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:53.635
Last time he saw them,
they were 20 feet away.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.939
And just was I was
going to give him an lV,

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.175
Sergeant Stichter
and Doc Old got there

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.977
and carried on from there.

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:05.747
Sergeant Patterson and all them took over,
and I pushed out with Cortez.

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:07.282
We didn't bound,
we didn't do anything,

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:08.750
we just ran in a straight line

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:12.420
and got to Rice as quick as we can.

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:15.323
At that point I kind of realized,
"Hey, l'm stable.

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:17.292
"You know, I been here
ten, fifteen minutes.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:20.729
I'm still breathing,
I'm not going into shock."

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.831
Kind of evaluating myself.

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:25.167
So basically just gave them orders to--

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.935
"Hey, you need
to maneuver your guys.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:30.472
And push up
and clear across that hilltop."

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.440
As l went up,
I didn't see anyone there.

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.409
I took a knee and set up security,

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.944
and when I turned to my right,

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.579
I saw Sergeant Rougle just laying there.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.714
I ran up and I saw
Sergeant Rougle's body

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:42.250
and it didn't even click.

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:43.885
I ran past him.

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:48.723
I saw his face, how it was,
kind of messed up.

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:52.761
I wanted to cry, but didn't.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.231
I was shocked, honestly.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:04:02.070
I was shocked because I saw
Sergeant Rougle just laying there.

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:06.441
It was-- It was chaos.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.978
And when we finally had a second

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:12.714
to stop and think,

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:15.016
that's when l realized that

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:18.353
one of my good friends
had gone, you know,

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:21.423
and I started hearing about
Sergeant Rice, Vandenberge.

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:24.359
I didn't even know that they
had been hit at that point.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.727
And...

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:38.406
I need a--

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:40.075
Yeah, time out. Hold on.

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:47.315
I'm just trying to keep
my train of thought.

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:10.038
Have that box ready.
Have the next goddamn box ready.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.207
Hey, I need immediate
suppression on 2251.

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.975
They enemy's pushed up
on the high ground--

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:18.947
We're not getting shit.

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:26.187
512255, if we've got A-10s,

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:31.459
I want gun runs from east to west
coming in, okay?

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.828
The hill's been taken over by the enemy.

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:34.963
That hill right here?

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:36.331
WiIdcat's hill.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:39.034
All right, we're going to go around
to the east and go around.

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.573
Hey, Abdul!
Get the fuck over here!

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:49.344
tell these guys we're pushing up
on this fucking ridge.

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:51.646
Hey, he wants us to go up
over this hill and bum rush it.

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.081
There's fucking dudes right there.

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:55.450
If we do that, we're going to have
to fucking lay down some--

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.285
We're going to have
to lay down fire first.

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:59.421
- Yeah, but we--
- We can't get a hold of them.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:00.722
We don't know where they're at.

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.624
That's why we have
to lay down fire first.

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.641
Look, they took fire
from right over here.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.509
Okay?

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:24.045
Hey, who's down?

01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:26.147
We got Sergeant Rougle and them up?

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:28.149
Hey.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.217
What?

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.056
Where they at?

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.327
Just keep down.

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:41.029
- Get down.
- What?

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.199
- What's going on?
- Just chill out, dude.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.002
- Chill the fuck out out.
- Who's over there?

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.303
Oh, my God.

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.273
Shut up.

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:55.944
Move, man.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.946
Is Sergeant Rice still alive?

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.681
- He's alive?
- He's going to make it.

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.920
- There's nothing we could do.
- Where's everybody else?

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:09.090
Hey, we've got friendlies here
and friendlies to your six, right there.

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:10.859
Vandenberge all right?

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.695
Vandenberge's already--
He's stable right now.

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:16.931
That ain't Sergeant Rougle.

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.968
You're lying, right, man?

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:23.471
Why would I lie about
something like that?

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:25.507
Where'd he get hit?
I got to see.

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:27.375
Don't look at him.
ls it bad?

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:28.877
Tell me, dude.
Tell me, dude.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.779
It was quick.
It was quick.

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:35.417
There was nothing we could do, bro!

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.728
Where the bad guys at?

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.430
Battle Six Romeo, this is two-six.

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:52.300
I've pushed to the site
of the KIA, break.

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:55.937
Right now we have the hilltop.

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:58.239
It's in the same vicinity as my last grid.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.108
Right now we're going
to move the wounded in action--

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.610
there's two of them--
back to LZ Eagles.

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:07.315
When Captain Kearney
told me up by the LZ

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:11.019
that Staff Sergeant Rougle was killed,

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.289
it was gut wrenching.

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:20.295
You know, there's different
levels to quality of fighters.

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:26.000
He was one of the best,
if not the best.

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:29.938
And l think that was what was tough
for a lot of people was,

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.973
you know, kind of knowing that
in the back of their mind,

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:35.143
well, if the best guy we have
out here just got killed,

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.578
where's that put me?

01:08:36.578 --> 01:08:38.846
What's going to happen to me?

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:42.350
What's going to happen
to the guy to my left, to my right?

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:52.227
Hey, we're going down here
to get the wounded first.

01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:05.206
- Hey, let's go.
- Let's go.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.774
It was a coordinated attack.

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:09.644
They drew all our attention
over to there from here.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:12.779
These guys over here
also returning fire from there.

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.482
They fucking flanked them.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:18.419
You can see where the path is here
where the fuckers came up.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.790
Okay, where's this fucking compound?
I want it destroyed.

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:25.693
Let's go.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.962
- Stichter, destroy it now.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:44.879
After we go ahead
and get the KlA out of here,

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.551
I want gunmetal to search
directly to my west.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:52.220
Hijar believes that he has a blood trail,

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.689
I want them to be getting
down low to try and PlD

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.224
and see where this guy's stopped.

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.560
It's likely that where
we find this son of a bitch

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.295
is where we find everybody else.

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:04.132
Hijar, make sure he understood that.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.527
Watch the pine trees.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:34.762
Just on the north side of that,
you can see a house on the corner.

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:36.497
As it cuts like that?

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:37.899
It comes almost like an L shape.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.901
- See the terraces right there?
- Got it.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:43.037
Okay, now, the fucking
far southeast side,

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:46.040
there's a fucking-- there's a dude
on the roof down in that house.

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:51.246
- About a thousand meters.
- Roger.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.716
Hey, Raeon's got a guy
to our northwest

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:58.720
on top of a building
walking around, over.

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.722
- Any other info?
- No.

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:02.523
He was looking up this way,

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:04.025
and he just came off the roof,

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.193
and he went back in his house.

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:06.594
Roger, acknowledge.

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:09.597
Raeon, next time you see that dude,
take his head off.

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:15.136
Where's that range finder at?

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:19.574
He was a good dude, man.

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.042
Sergeant Rougle?

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:24.812
- You want a real cigarette?
- Yeah.

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:31.085
I'm worried about the rest of the guys.
They've been taking it real bad.

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:34.289
One Alpha's kind of
blaming it on himself

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.557
because we couldn't
push over the top,

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:38.726
but the thing he's got to understand
is they fucking--

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.428
He was dead instantly.

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.063
There's nothing you can do right there.

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:04.986
Actually, l can't even sleep, honestly.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.755
I've been on about four or five
different types of sleeping pills

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.057
and none of them help.

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:11.092
That's how bad the nightmares are.

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:13.628
I prefer not to sleep
and not dream about it,

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:16.030
than sleep and...

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:18.566
just see the picture in my head is...

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:19.634
pretty bad.

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:29.811
That actually stuck with me
for the rest of the deployment.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:36.284
Stuck with me through
coming back here to Italy.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.488
I still obviously haven't...

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:42.824
figured out how to deal
with it inside.

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:50.031
The only hope
I have right now is that

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.834
eventually l'll be able
to process it differently.

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:55.103
I'm never going to forget it.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.438
Never going to even let go of it.

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:02.710
l don't want to not
have that as a memory

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.479
because that was tone of the moments

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.049
that makes me appreciate
everything that I have.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.334
Steiner?

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.470
Steiner, come on!

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:21.148
Not yet. Not yet.

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:01.889
Still working to try to bring about

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:05.993
the Korengal
to get the road moving here.

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:08.129
Are you really drawing
the Korengal Valley?

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.099
lt's the only thing
I know how to draw.

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:21.175
I just send it home in letters.

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.610
Just draw.

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:48.336
So do you have a songbook or something,

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:51.639
or an exercise book to practice with?

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.873
You just fuck around?

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.108
Yeah I'm just fucking around.

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:57.511
You need one of those books,
with the charts on them.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.380
Yeah, I need-- that would be nice.

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:01.616
Restrepo was teaching me that stuff,

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:05.686
but he-- he taught me like a few,

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:08.189
but l wrote just one, a C chord,

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:11.792
but, you know, I don't know.

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:14.495
I still have his--

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:17.331
I actually still have
one of his Flamenco books

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:18.799
or whatever it is.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.868
How to play guitar flamenco,
you know.

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:24.205
He was amazing on guitar.

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:26.841
- It was just beautiful music.
- It was amazing.

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:28.843
He used to grow
his fingernails out real long,

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:30.845
and put like nail hardener.

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:33.214
So we always used
to get on him about that.

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:35.182
Yeah, but-- with his teeth--

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:36.617
"yeah, but can--

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:39.020
"can you play the guitar
like me, yo, son?

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.354
Shun?"

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:05.913
Twenty seven May,
movement to contact west of Restrepo.

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:09.717
Task disrupt, purpose prevent AAF
from building mass fires on Restrepo.

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:11.352
That concludes my report. Over.

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:17.858
- How long till he gets tired?
- Hump him, Walker.

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.293
Ow, my hip.

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:24.265
Is he squeezing you
with his fucking mammoth legs?

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:31.672
- Heart punch, heart punch.
- There you go, film Walker.

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:32.940
Walker!

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.312
I think they just changed,
didn't they?

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:40.815
I just want to see.

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.817
- Walker.
- I'm bored.

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:44.552
Say something to your wife.
Dude, you know you want to.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.120
Hey, babe, I miss you.

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.788
Can't wait to get home and--

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:53.260
Hurry up, hurry up!

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:55.596
Do you want to know
when you're going home or not?

01:18:57.165 --> 01:19:00.301
All right, what's been told
to the wives is

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:02.837
we'll be back in Italy,
not out of country,

01:19:02.838 --> 01:19:06.073
back in Italy between
August 4th and 7th.

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:08.175
So look at your fucking watch.

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:11.278
Two months from today
and counting down.

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:13.948
That's bad news if you're
one of those dudes that's like,

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.950
"Fuck, I love it here and I wanted
to wait till September

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:17.251
and get an extra thousand dollars."

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.286
And if that's you, I don't care.

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:21.255
Fuck you.
We're going home.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.766
Today things were a little bit hectic.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.568
We found out that one of our sister
companies, Chosen Company,

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:37.004
up north of Camp Blessing,

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:40.241
starting a new base lost nine soldiers

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:44.845
and had an additional twelve US wounded

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:47.848
and an thirteen additional ANA
that were wounded.

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:53.387
Hey, is this everybody?

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:55.089
We got the Mortars?
We got Second Platoon?

01:19:57.893 --> 01:20:01.695
Okay, hey, listen up.

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:04.064
I'm going to talk to you guys
a little bit about

01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:08.068
some of what happened
up with Chosen Company.

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:10.271
I want you guys to mourn,

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:13.340
and then l want you guys
to get over it and do your jobs.

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.276
Okay?

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:17.478
First-- Hey, Proctor,
why did you come in the army, man?

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.281
To fight for my country, sir.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.849
- To fight for your country?
- Roger, sir.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.051
Did you expect that
you might get injured or die?

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.286
Absolutely, sir.

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:27.688
Anybody join not knowing that
that might be an option?

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:33.961
We lose PFC Vimoto on June 5th, 2007.

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:36.597
What happens the very next day
after that, Sergeant Buno?

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:40.968
We go out on patrols,
we get attacked again.

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:43.170
Right.

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:46.173
July 22nd, we lose Restrepo, right?

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:50.010
What do we keep on doing after that?

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.111
Fighting.

01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:53.380
We keep on fighting
and taking it to the enemy, right?

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:56.750
What do you guys think would have
happened if we had just stopped at Vimoto

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:59.286
and acted like
our predecessors before us

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.622
and we stood our ground there,

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:04.024
didn't go out there doing
our aggressive patrolling,

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:06.260
didn't go out there
and build OP Restrepo,

01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:08.996
which I think we'll all venture to say,

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:12.533
like, pretty much changed the entire
dynamics of the entire valley?

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.303
You guys know what
would have happened?

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:19.139
The same shit that happened
today up at Chosen Company.

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.941
Now with Chosen Company,

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:23.711
they went into an area that they
knew was going to be contested.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.746
They knew what they were getting into.

01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:30.784
They've been talking about
going to Wanat since July of 2007.

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:33.420
We went there, they did it.

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.122
The fucking only way to bounce back

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:37.024
from shit like this is to go out there

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:39.326
and make the individuals
that did this to us fucking pay.

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.931
It's not to sit back here and hide.

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:46.133
It's not to go back down
to our fucking rucks

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:47.935
and fucking feel sorry for ourselves

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.536
and get snuggled up in our woobie.

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:52.806
We go out there, we find
the motherfuckers that did this

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:53.874
and we make them pay.

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.943
We make them feeI
how we feel right now.

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.414
For those of you guys that pray,

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:06.053
let's go ahead and take
a moment of silence in--

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:07.755
in remembrance the ten--

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.957
ten to nine soldiers that we lost today

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:12.159
and the families of them

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.396
and the families
of those that were hurt,

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:16.931
and then I'll let you guys go ahead

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.465
and get about your business.

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:47.328
Get down.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.886
Oh, wow, you can't see shit now.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.592
Hey, can I shoot Sergeant Mac?
I'm I'm going to fucking get him.

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:19.793
- Can I shoot?
- Wait till he engages.

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:22.162
Wait till he engages,
then fucking fucking get him.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:26.967
There he goes.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.374
Low right, low right!

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:34.375
Low right!

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.314
- Hey, that motherfucker's done.
- Is he?

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:45.219
Hey, Olson, he's done.

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:48.422
Yeah!

01:23:48.423 --> 01:23:51.225
A direct hit on that dude.

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:52.726
That motherfucker's done, man!

01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:54.995
That motherfucker's done, dude!

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:56.597
Fuck you, bitches!

01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:57.765
Body parts falling apart.

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.366
The L-Ras, dude,

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:03.070
it was him running
and then him blasting into pieces.

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:05.105
- Yeah?
- Yeah, dude.

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:07.841
There you go, motherfucker,
shoot at us again.

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:15.215
By the end, like I was--

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:18.018
I really didn't want to get overrun.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.590
But l just wish they were closer

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:26.827
so l could have actually seen them
when I killed them.

01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:32.733
626 perstat,

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:35.369
I have twenty Restrepo.

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.771
The only question I have is tonight,

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:41.842
are we going to be doing
an illum round for Doc Restrepo?

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:43.510
Today's twenty two July.

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:45.746
Over.

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:48.082
Yeah, we're planning
on doing the illum round.

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:54.054
One last thing, seventeen tonight

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:56.223
they're shooting for Doc Restrepo.

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.025
Seventeen tonight.

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.829
He's fucking a little bit drunk.

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.997
I'm fucking--
I'm a little bit drunk at this point.

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.532
And I see him--

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:08.268
I see him just eyeing everyone up,
just like this.

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:09.670
Who is that, Kim?

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:11.705
No, Restrepo.

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:13.006
Eyeing everyone up.

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.508
I come up to him
and I'm like, "What's wrong, bro?"

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:15.809
He's like, "Yo, bro,

01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:17.845
I'm going to stab these fools, yo."

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:19.746
I'm like, I see it in his hand.

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:22.316
He's got the fucking Gerber
out with the knife out,

01:25:22.317 --> 01:25:25.385
fucking closed up, just ready
to fucking shank someone, dude.

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:28.689
I'm like-- and this is
after the night before

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:34.128
we ended up down in the fucking
the steps of Rome fucking train station,

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:37.631
and I was peeing, in my pants.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:48.041
What we did to mark
the anniversary of our dead,

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.576
we shot off flares,

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:53.447
and where Restrepo died,
we shot off flares.

01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:01.655
You know, and kind of raise one up.

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:04.591
Say a prayer,
say a few words in your head

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:06.493
and you move on.

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:37.951
Did my last patrol hopefully.

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:40.053
Hopefully I don't get called
back out for something.

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:44.024
Fly out of here in a few days.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.862
It's kind of strange thinking you'll never
come back to OP Restrepo again.

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:50.697
Yeah.

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:52.299
It's a good feeling, though.

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.168
It's been a long fucking
deployment right there.

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:59.206
Leaving Restrepo?

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:01.475
It's too good to be true, you know?

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:04.278
We're going to die here.
lsn't that right, Henry?

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.380
- Roger, Sergeant.
- But we're leaving instead.

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:09.216
God's going to fuck with our emotions

01:28:09.217 --> 01:28:10.751
and kill us on the bird out.

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:16.923
I'm never coming back,
never coming back.

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:20.227
It's time to go.

01:28:25.066 --> 01:28:26.533
That's heavy.

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.940
Goodbye, OP Restrepo.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.844
I'm never going to have
to be here again.

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:45.118
Not that I didn't enjoy my time here,

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.987
but it's time to move on.

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:55.829
- Yes!
- See you later.

01:28:58.266 --> 01:29:00.400
The high point for us was going home.

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:02.402
Getting out of there.

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:05.305
Going home, seriously.
No doubt about it.

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:08.775
Each one of my soldiers' face,
you can tell, going home.

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:12.979
We done our job.

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.048
We did what we were supposed
to have been doing

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.550
and we out of here.

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:29.496
The Korengal, as far as--
What did we we achieve?

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:31.765
I'm always going
to think about Restrepo.

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:37.404
BuiIding Restrepo was the single
most important event

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:40.073
for the Korengal.

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:43.176
And how...

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:44.611
how the boys did it.

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:45.612
Fighting.

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:49.516
And then turning around
and going back to working.

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:05.132
It makes us proud
when we see the news--

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:07.534
they still call it Restrepo--

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:09.269
knowing that, you know,

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.538
we painted it on the walls,
this is for Doc Restrepo.

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:14.608
The name fit the place after a while,

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:17.310
after it became built up,

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.746
after it became a better place.

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:22.349
But when l hear Restrepo,

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:25.252
I still think of the person.

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:28.255
You can't-- You can't tame the beast.

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:31.091
You know?

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.759
Got him.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.694
Yeah, he got him. He got him.

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:35.996
He did get him.

01:30:35.997 --> 01:30:37.297
Hey, Lex, what's going on tonight?

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:39.332
Just tell us.
Break it down, break it down.

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:40.667
All I want to do

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:42.669
is find a miniature zebra,

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:45.305
put a little tiny saddle on it and ride it.

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.908
There ain't no zebras on the pub crawl.

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:51.111
I didn't-- Miniature zebras.

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:54.948
My bad, there are miniature zebras.
What the fuck?

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:57.083
Let's say goodbye,
let's say goodbye.

01:30:57.084 --> 01:31:00.153
Hey, tune in next time where
we're going to be still drunk as fuck.

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:01.721
Saying goodnight
to the bad guy, man.

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:03.723
The same time,
the same dope rhyme,

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:06.226
because we're going
to be still loving life

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:08.128
and getting ready to go to war.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.428
Here or hea?

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.430
H-E-A. Hea.

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:27.267
"O'Byrne wuz hea."

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:28.335
That's how we roll.
