06:23.984 --> 06:27.755
WITH YOU AGAIN.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.256
AND--

06:29.256 --> 06:31.258
[moans]

06:33.126 --> 06:34.462
>> SORRY.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.463
DIDN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND

06:35.463 --> 06:37.130
OF HOW MUCH YOU'RE INTO ME.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.132
>> [sighs]

06:41.902 --> 06:42.836
>> * I AM A FIRST-CLASS

06:42.836 --> 06:44.171
* FABULOUS, EXCELLENT WOMAN

06:44.171 --> 06:45.473

06:45.473 --> 06:47.074
* HOPES TO SOMEDAY BE

06:47.074 --> 06:47.908
* I AM THE QUEEN

06:47.908 --> 06:49.076
>> [laughs]

06:49.076 --> 06:50.143
NUH-UH.

06:50.143 --> 06:50.978
>> COME ON.

06:50.978 --> 06:51.879
>> RAQUEL, NO.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.481
>> TERRENCE, I TOLD YOU.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.648
LOOK, CHENG DOESN'T NEED

06:54.648 --> 06:55.716
OUR BUSINESS, OKAY?

06:55.716 --> 06:56.884
HE IS BOOKED THROUGHOUT

06:56.884 --> 06:57.918
THE YEAR.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.052
WE NEED HIM.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.588
HE'S SUPER TRADITIONAL

07:00.588 --> 07:01.989
AND VERY OLD-SCHOOL.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.156
YOU CAN'T GO DRESSED LIKE YOU'RE

07:03.156 --> 07:04.725
GONNA GO ROLL UP ON

07:04.725 --> 07:05.826
SOME SHORTIES.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.496
>> RAQUEL, STOP.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.097
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.499
>> JUST TRY THIS ON, PLEASE.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.933
>> [sighs]

07:12.933 --> 07:15.402
>> SO WHEN WE MEET WITH CHENG,

07:15.402 --> 07:16.737
REMEMBER TO BRING A GIFT.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.171
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TRADITION

07:18.171 --> 07:19.607
IN THE CHINESE CULTURE.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.509
ALSO, HE'S GONNA EXPECT TO

07:21.509 --> 07:23.911
EXCHANGE BUSINESS CARDS, SO

07:23.911 --> 07:25.245
DO I NEED TO GET YOU ANY?

07:25.245 --> 07:26.413
>> YEAH.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.347
I MEAN, THEN YOU CAN GO WITH ME

07:27.347 --> 07:28.782
INTO THE BATHROOM,

07:28.782 --> 07:30.017
HELP ME UNZIP.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.285
OR WOULD YOU RATHER HOLD IT?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.621
BUSINESS CARDS.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.588
CHILL, MA.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.189
I GOT THIS.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.157
>> GOOD.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.191
NOW, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS

07:38.191 --> 07:39.760
REMEMBER THREE SIMPLE RULES.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.828
>> THREE RULES?

07:40.828 --> 07:43.130
>> ONE, DON'T INTERRUPT.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.298
TWO, NO OFF-COLOR LANGUAGE,

07:45.298 --> 07:46.133
PLEASE.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.535
THREE, DON'T BE SO

07:47.535 --> 07:51.171
ARGUMENTA...TIVE.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.005
>> YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU

07:52.005 --> 07:53.306
LIKE, BUCKHEAD?

07:53.306 --> 07:54.141
>> HUH?

07:54.141 --> 07:56.276
>> HUH?

07:56.276 --> 07:57.611
>> WHAT?

07:57.611 --> 07:58.846
>> WHAT?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.313
>> UH, NO.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.082
>> YEAH.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.585
THINK YOU DO.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.022
CAN A BROTHER SEE THE MIRROR?

08:09.022 --> 08:09.890
>> [gasps]

08:09.890 --> 08:10.724
OH, RIGHT.

08:10.724 --> 08:11.559
YEAH, OF COURSE.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.193
GO AHEAD.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.695
>> NO INTERRUPTIONS,

08:14.695 --> 08:16.096
NO ARGUMENTS.

08:16.096 --> 08:20.233
BASICALLY DON'T BE GHETTO.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.770
>> EXACTLY.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.772
>> I GET IT.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.243
>> SEE?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.311
YOU LOOK GOOD.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.813
>> I ALWAYS LOOK GOOD.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.781
NOW I'M JUST DOING IT IN

08:33.781 --> 08:35.649
YOUR BOUGIE-ASS CLOTHES.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.117
>> [scoffs]

08:37.117 --> 08:38.619
>> CAN I GET SOME PANTS?

08:38.619 --> 08:40.453
>> OH, NOW YOU WANT SOME OF

08:40.453 --> 08:41.789
MY PANTS.

08:41.789 --> 08:42.890
OKAY, THEN.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.391
WE'LL GET YOU PANTS.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.293
>> APPRECIATE IT.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.460
NOT THOSE.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.328
MM-MM.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.296
>> * EVERYBODY'S GOT *

08:49.296 --> 08:50.130
* THOSE DAYS

08:50.130 --> 08:51.498
* WHEN THE SUN DON'T SHINE *

08:51.498 --> 08:52.600
>> HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW IF

08:52.600 --> 08:53.934
MY PITCH TO FELICIA WORKED WITH

08:53.934 --> 08:54.835
THE HORNDOG FROM HELL

08:54.835 --> 08:57.104
UNDERMINING EVERY MOVE I MADE.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.105
>> YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE YOU

08:58.105 --> 09:00.340
HATE, DAVID SURE SEEMS TO BE

09:00.340 --> 09:02.242
ON YOUR MIND A LOT.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.611
>> OKAY, OKAY, HE KEEPS ME

09:03.611 --> 09:04.377
ON MY TOES.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.212
THAT'S IT.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.146
HAVEN'T YOU EVER MET SOMEONE

09:06.146 --> 09:07.314
THAT YOU CAN'T STAND, AND, FOR

09:07.314 --> 09:08.515
SOME REASON, YOU JUST CAN'T STOP

09:08.515 --> 09:09.349
THINKING ABOUT 'EM?

09:09.349 --> 09:10.517
>> UGH, YES.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.384
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT THAT

09:11.384 --> 09:12.886
SHADY-ASS NAOMI.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.055
YOU KNOW, AS ANNOYING AS SHE IS,

09:15.055 --> 09:16.389
I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT SHE

09:16.389 --> 09:18.225
AND MALCOLM SR. MIGHT REALLY

09:18.225 --> 09:19.627
HAVE HAD A LOVE THING.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.527
MAYBE THEY REALLY DID

09:20.527 --> 09:21.361
GET MARRIED.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.195
>> WOW.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.196
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

09:23.196 --> 09:24.998
>> NOTHING, FOR NOW.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.634
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS,

09:26.634 --> 09:27.635
WHICH FREES THEM UP

09:27.635 --> 09:28.636
FOR POKER TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.703
>> OOH, I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU

09:29.703 --> 09:31.171
MENTION POKER IN A LONG TIME.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.072
>> I KNOW, RIGHT?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.641
IT'S EITHER POKER, OR I'LL GO

09:33.641 --> 09:34.642
FIND NAOMI AND--

09:34.642 --> 09:35.709
>> POKER SOUNDS GOOD.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.177
YEAH, LET'S STICK TO THAT.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.647
[both chuckle]

09:39.647 --> 09:40.648
[R&B music]

09:40.648 --> 09:45.753
*

09:45.753 --> 09:46.687
OH.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.355
OKAY, FELICIA'S ALMOST HERE,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.190
SO I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY

09:50.190 --> 09:52.092
THAT WE NEED FELICIA'S BLESSING,

09:52.092 --> 09:52.926
OKAY?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.061
SO JUST IGNORE THE EVIL SPEWING

09:54.061 --> 09:55.562
OUT OF HER MOUTH, KEISHA,

09:55.562 --> 09:56.930
AND ALLOW HER TO MAKE INDULGENCE

09:56.930 --> 09:59.066
THE NEW HOT PLACE TO SHOP.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.233
WHEN I TELL YOU SHE IS

10:00.233 --> 10:02.936
A COLOSSAL BITCH--

10:02.936 --> 10:05.639
SHE'S BEHIND ME, RIGHT?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.741
>> APRIL, SHE'S NOT HERE.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.575
>> IT'S SO WEIRD.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.476
I KEEP THINKING SHE'S RIGHT

10:09.476 --> 10:10.310
BEHIND ME.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.144
STRANGE.

10:11.144 --> 10:11.979
ANYWAY, MY POINT IS, SHE IS

10:11.979 --> 10:12.813
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY

10:12.813 --> 10:13.647
DIFFICULT.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.815
I MEAN, IF YOU TAKE OMAROSA

10:14.815 --> 10:16.416
AND SATAN AND THEY HAVE A CHILD

10:16.416 --> 10:20.087
TOGETHER, SHE IS ABOUT THAT AW--

10:20.087 --> 10:22.890
[whispering] OH, GOD.

10:26.159 --> 10:26.994
UM...

10:26.994 --> 10:28.061
>> WHY DOES EVERYONE ASSUME

10:28.061 --> 10:29.296
SATAN IS A MAN?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.964
>> FELICIA,

10:30.964 --> 10:32.132
WELCOME TO INDULGENCE.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.633
>> THANK YOU.

HMM, KEISHA GREENE.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.270
WELL, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY

10:37.270 --> 10:38.471

WHAT WAS THAT NICKNAME THAT

10:51.084 --> 10:52.085

THE PAST, IS THERE?

10:54.487 --> 10:55.488
GOOD TO SEE YOU, DARLING.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.117
I ADMIRE ABOUT FELICIA:

11:24.117 --> 11:25.452
HER ABILITY TO CAPTURE PEOPLE

11:25.452 --> 11:26.754
IN HER SPELL.

11:26.754 --> 11:27.520

11:30.123 --> 11:30.958
I REMEMBER YOU FROM

11:30.958 --> 11:31.925
THAT WEDDING.

11:31.925 --> 11:32.893
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S BEEN

11:32.893 --> 11:34.294
A BAD BOY, HOGGING ALL

11:34.294 --> 11:35.863
THE CUTENESS TO HIMSELF.

YOUR WAY.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.437
>> OF COURSE.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.973
ONE SHOULD NEVER PRESUME.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.441
HOWEVER, MAYBE A 20% DISCOUNT

11:48.441 --> 11:49.442
WOULD SWAY YOUR DECISION.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.878
>> I WAS THINKING WHOLESALE.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.979
>> FOR YOUR CLIENTS, SURE.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.975
THEY ALSO SCREAM EXPENSIVE,

12:21.975 --> 12:22.976
BUT I'M SURE THAT DISCOUNT

12:22.976 --> 12:23.811
WILL SHUT 'EM UP.

12:23.811 --> 12:24.644
>> OH, MY GOD.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.712
IS IT MY IMAGINATION, OR IS

12:25.712 --> 12:26.679
THIS GOING OKAY?

12:26.679 --> 12:27.547
>> I THINK IT DID.

12:27.547 --> 12:28.381

12:30.884 --> 12:31.718
>> GIRL, YOU HAVE NOTHING

12:31.718 --> 12:32.585

12:33.854 --> 12:35.889
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE HOT.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.424
>> IT BETTER BE, OR ELSE I'LL
