Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:38.760 --> 01:39.840
No!

02:03.359 --> 02:05.319
I know you're coming.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.318
And I'll be waiting.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.757
So, being two decades on,

02:30.759 --> 02:33.278
you finally know the
truth about your parents.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.197
Yeah.

02:34.199 --> 02:37.358
I mean like, I know it wasn't a
scarecrow.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.160
I don't even know how I thought
that even just for a minute.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.317
It's not uncommon for people
that experience traumatic

02:45.319 --> 02:47.798
things to go into their psyche
and create

02:47.800 --> 02:50.278
a fantasy to be able to cope
with it.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.518
You were six years old,
you watched your parents

02:52.520 --> 02:54.958
being brutally slain in your own
home.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.238
You know, that's quite
awful to have to deal with.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.757
So putting a mask on the
identity of the killer is,

03:00.759 --> 03:02.518
is quite a normal
thing that people

03:02.520 --> 03:04.998
do in those, in those
circumstances.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.798
I just now think that
it's time for you

03:07.800 --> 03:10.600
to move forward now,
which I think you have.

03:11.719 --> 03:12.798
Yeah.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.360
I mean, I just wanna
know who it was.

03:16.479 --> 03:18.719
You know, like I can't
get it out of my head.

03:20.759 --> 03:23.199
Do you still have
access to the family home?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.238
Yep.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.480
And who lives there now?

03:29.319 --> 03:31.879
My brother Carl.

03:32.919 --> 03:34.799
I don't think he ever moved on.

03:36.919 --> 03:38.959
I think maybe you should go
back there.

03:40.599 --> 03:41.879
How do you feel about that?

03:46.680 --> 03:48.037
No, I couldn't.

03:48.039 --> 03:49.958
If you're over this trauma,

03:49.960 --> 03:52.637
and I thought that
we'd dealt with it.

03:52.639 --> 03:54.597
We have dealt with it.

03:54.599 --> 03:56.317
See, you just said we.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.998
It's not we June,
this is your journey.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.838
Only you are responsible,

04:00.840 --> 04:03.838
and can take the action
into your recovery.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.678
I can only take you so far.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.360
But it's down to you.

04:09.879 --> 04:10.759
You're right.

04:11.639 --> 04:12.839
So what do you suggest?

04:15.439 --> 04:17.279
I think you should
call your brother.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.678
And what's this in aid of?

04:38.680 --> 04:42.040
Hey Carl, it's nice to hear
your voice.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.077
You too, sis.

04:46.079 --> 04:47.637
Last time was what?

04:47.639 --> 04:48.718
Christmas?

04:48.720 --> 04:49.877
I know, I'm so sorry.

04:49.879 --> 04:51.719
I've been terrible.

04:53.079 --> 04:54.877
But I wanted to let you know
that, um,

04:54.879 --> 04:57.637
I'm gonna come and
see you, tomorrow.

04:57.639 --> 05:00.038
No, you're not to come here.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.877
You know you're
not to come here.

05:01.879 --> 05:04.718
Carl, come on, I mean
it's been 20 years,

05:04.720 --> 05:06.320
I wanna be with you tomorrow.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.118
And I wanna remember the good
things, not just how it ended.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.598
It's been 20 years,
and he will rise again.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.118
Carl, I thought we were past
this.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.158
It wasn't a scarecrow,

05:18.160 --> 05:22.637
it was probably a burglary
gone wrong or something.

05:22.639 --> 05:24.998
We really have to face the
truth, we're not kids anymore.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.480
I am, and it's about
time you did, too.

05:34.439 --> 05:35.600
I knew you'd come back.

05:37.519 --> 05:38.399
Carl?

05:39.519 --> 05:41.918
Carl, I'm coming tomorrow, okay?

05:41.920 --> 05:43.360
I don't care what you say.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.640
I wanna be with you, I
wanna hang out with you.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.077
It's not safe
for you here.

05:49.079 --> 05:50.479
I've got to go.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.560
Carl?

06:20.600 --> 06:21.480
Come on!

06:23.600 --> 06:24.480
Come on!

06:31.040 --> 06:32.400
Show yourself!

06:34.360 --> 06:35.160
I see you.

06:40.519 --> 06:41.399
Come on!

07:53.240 --> 07:55.277
No, you don't have to come
with me.

07:55.279 --> 07:59.757
Stop, I've been through
it all with you so far, so.

07:59.759 --> 08:01.039
Come on, when?

08:02.879 --> 08:04.077
Tomorrow morning.

08:04.079 --> 08:05.517
Tomorrow morning?

08:05.519 --> 08:06.479
Yeah.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.757
I've gotta fix my hair
but, should be all right.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.077
Stop it, you dork.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.558
You don't have to have your
hair done for the farm.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.600
Why not?

08:21.720 --> 08:23.837
You dunno who could be there.

08:23.839 --> 08:25.279
Give me a minute.

08:29.199 --> 08:30.519
June speaking.

09:27.879 --> 09:30.157
I can't believe it.

09:30.159 --> 09:32.039
I can't believe he's dead.

09:36.120 --> 09:40.318
Well, they said it was
suicide, do you believe there's

09:40.320 --> 09:42.800
any reason to think that
it was anything else?

09:45.679 --> 09:47.078
Well, they determined suicide,

09:47.080 --> 09:49.759
but they found him
strung up in the barn.

09:53.000 --> 09:53.958
June!

09:53.960 --> 09:57.198
I've just heard, I am so sorry.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.360
Oh, bless you.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.157
You'll get through this,
all right?

10:02.159 --> 10:03.838
We're gonna get
through this together,

10:03.840 --> 10:04.877
- all right?
- Thank you.

10:04.879 --> 10:06.358
All right.

10:43.039 --> 10:45.838
Oh according to this, we should
of gone left way back there.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.998
Jesus Christ, this place
is in the middle of nowhere!

10:48.000 --> 10:49.718
Oh wait, pull over, pull over.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.080
Ask that lady over there,
she might know where we are.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.598
Hi.

11:04.600 --> 11:09.478
Hey, hey love, are you able to
help us?

11:09.480 --> 11:10.360
Yeah, what's up?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.078
We're just
looking for directions

11:14.080 --> 11:15.360
for the Old Creek Manor.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.637
Old Creek Manor?

11:18.639 --> 11:19.438
Why do you wanna
go to that place?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.120
No one's been there in years.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.877
The man that lives there.

11:23.879 --> 11:25.919
Yeah, he got killed honey,
last night.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.118
Yeah, we know.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.720
Are you able to just give
us directions to the manor?

11:37.919 --> 11:40.958
Right, you know some crazy
shit went on there, right?

11:40.960 --> 11:42.478
People won't go out of these
woods,

11:42.480 --> 11:45.157
that's why you probably
won't see any road signs but.

11:45.159 --> 11:46.838
They say that the urban legends
are real,

11:46.840 --> 11:49.198
the scarecrow actually kills
people.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.118
You know what happened there

11:50.120 --> 11:51.118
- about 20 years ago, right?
- Yeah, and

11:51.120 --> 11:52.958
do you know the way?

11:52.960 --> 11:55.118
Like I said, honey, you're
not gonna find any road signs.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.838
People don't go out that
far since the murders, but,

11:57.840 --> 11:58.877
keep going straight, right?

11:58.879 --> 12:00.157
Straight through those woods.

12:00.159 --> 12:02.198
Hit left, then, you
won't miss it, all right?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.397
Thank you.

12:03.399 --> 12:06.397
But I can't advice you enough.

12:06.399 --> 12:09.799
Stay away from those woods for
your own safety, all right?

12:15.240 --> 12:18.157
You okay?

12:18.159 --> 12:19.917
Just ignore her.

12:19.919 --> 12:21.517
Crazy lady.

12:21.519 --> 12:22.517
June?

12:22.519 --> 12:23.720
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.759
That's why I moved from here.

12:27.879 --> 12:30.279
All these stupid legends
the locals make up.

12:32.559 --> 12:33.959
Don't listen to her.

13:36.159 --> 13:39.000
Right where he always left
them.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
They're his.

14:07.039 --> 14:07.919
Sorry.

14:10.159 --> 14:11.118
It's okay, that's why we're
here.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.320
We've gotta clean the place up.

14:23.639 --> 14:24.598
It's been a long day.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.958
Why don't we all just
get some rest, yeah?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.037
Sure.

14:29.039 --> 14:31.519
And, if you need anything,
you know where I am.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.277
- All right.
- Thank you.

14:36.279 --> 14:38.000
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Karen.

14:39.679 --> 14:40.677
Do you wanna?

14:40.679 --> 14:41.879
I'm not tired yet.

14:43.000 --> 14:43.879
Come on.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.440
20 years, huh?

15:06.080 --> 15:08.360
Yeah, it's been 20 years
since I've been here.

15:14.639 --> 15:15.598
You okay?

15:15.600 --> 15:16.480
Yeah.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.277
Yeah.

15:54.519 --> 15:56.757
Chanel, I don't think it's
a good idea us being out here.

15:56.759 --> 16:00.198
John, stop,
it's fucking cool, okay?

16:00.200 --> 16:01.637
Some guys kills himself and
you think

16:01.639 --> 16:03.478
being on his land is cool?

16:03.480 --> 16:05.720
Well, you know the truth
about this land right?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.757
I don't wanna hear
about no urban legends.

16:09.759 --> 16:12.637
Come on, just hear me out,
please.

16:27.559 --> 16:29.439
Right, this crazy bitch.

16:30.639 --> 16:31.557
What about it?

16:31.559 --> 16:35.358
Well, legend says that the
scarecrow

16:35.360 --> 16:37.238
is on this land, right?

16:37.240 --> 16:41.200
And his spirit remains on the
field waiting to walk again.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.478
The catch with that, is that a
scarecrow

16:47.480 --> 16:49.399
is created to ward off crows.

16:53.080 --> 16:58.080
True, but the truth
also is that on this land,

16:59.759 --> 17:04.238
centuries ago, there was a
man left out to die here.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.640
And apparently the locals
caught him stealing,

17:08.759 --> 17:11.198
and they found him doing
all sorts of fucked

17:11.200 --> 17:12.240
up shit with animals.

17:13.720 --> 17:17.640
So they just hung him up
and let the crows get him.

17:28.118 --> 17:29.000
Yeah, okay.

17:30.079 --> 17:34.039
Fine, don't believe me,
but it is real.

17:34.759 --> 17:36.640
And his spirit does remain here.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.557
Okay, you know what?

17:41.559 --> 17:43.398
Follow me, come on.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.718
You want proof?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.638
Not really.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.320
Come on, come on.

17:50.559 --> 17:51.797
Come on.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.560
Look, I know.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.597
With everything that's
happened to you in the past,

18:07.599 --> 18:10.480
with your parents, you
know it must be so hard.

18:11.359 --> 18:13.639
And I can only comprehend
like a little bit

18:15.759 --> 18:19.837
but I know that you must be
feeling so alone sometimes

18:19.839 --> 18:22.720
and I just want you to know
that I'm there for you.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.080
Thank you.

18:29.519 --> 18:32.200
You don't have to thank
me, we're like family now.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.519
I'm not going anywhere.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.480
If you need me I'm just
across the doorway.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.638
Thank you so much.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.759
Don't thank me.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.878
Night.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.120
Goodnight.

19:13.920 --> 19:14.759
Hold on.

19:16.960 --> 19:17.840
Got it.

19:18.920 --> 19:19.759
Wow.

19:29.759 --> 19:32.478
Oh fuck, they cleaned it.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.357
What?

19:33.359 --> 19:35.438
Oh no, that suicide guy,
he put some

19:35.440 --> 19:37.398
weird shit on the wall
about the scarecrow

19:37.400 --> 19:39.357
that I wanted to show you.

19:39.359 --> 19:41.198
Oh, right, well, shall we go
then?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.759
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, stay.

19:44.759 --> 19:45.998
Why?

19:46.000 --> 19:50.557
Oh, if the scarecrow turns
up, that would be rather cool.

19:50.559 --> 19:52.357
I don't think there's anything
thrilling

19:52.359 --> 19:55.479
about a cold and creepy barn.

19:58.640 --> 20:02.480
Don't you think it would be
hot if we make love in here?

20:04.279 --> 20:06.398
Oh god, what are you doing?

20:06.400 --> 20:07.280
Come on.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.517
Don't you think that if
the scarecrow guy was here

20:19.519 --> 20:21.920
that he'd show me a good time?

20:23.680 --> 20:27.198
Oh, well he can have
you and I'll go safely.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.837
Come on now, seriously.

20:29.839 --> 20:30.720
But I'm horny.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.360
Look, so am I but I don't
wanna do this.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.037
Oh, what are you doing?

20:38.039 --> 20:38.879
Come on.

20:43.000 --> 20:43.839
Come on.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.279
Oh my god, stop.

20:55.799 --> 20:56.718
Oh, fuck it.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.478
I told you it'd be a thrill.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.557
What the fuck are you on
about?

21:19.559 --> 21:20.678
We need to go right now.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.918
It's probably the scarecrow,
shall we go find him?

21:22.920 --> 21:23.797
What do you think?

21:23.799 --> 21:24.678
No.

21:24.680 --> 21:25.799
Let's do it.

21:27.559 --> 21:28.478
Come on.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.678
Chanel, we need to leave.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.198
I'm gonna go find the
scarecrow.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.039
No.

21:36.519 --> 21:37.400
Chanel!

21:39.559 --> 21:42.759
Come out, come out, wherever
you are.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.039
Chanel?

21:51.440 --> 21:52.517
Oh god.

21:53.359 --> 21:55.517
Oh, not the button.

21:55.519 --> 21:56.400
Come on.

22:01.519 --> 22:02.517
Chanel?

22:02.519 --> 22:03.398
What?

22:03.400 --> 22:04.438
My light's not working.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.718
Then turn it on, then.

22:06.720 --> 22:07.597
I'm trying.

22:07.599 --> 22:09.117
Stop being a little bitch,
all right?

22:09.119 --> 22:09.958
Can't.

22:09.960 --> 22:10.840
Shut up.

22:24.799 --> 22:26.799
Chanel, my light's not
working.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.960
Fine, I'm gonna try and
turn the light on, all right?

22:36.640 --> 22:37.520
Chanel?

23:37.839 --> 23:38.720
Ow, ow.

24:51.279 --> 24:52.160
June?

25:02.960 --> 25:03.840
Girls?

25:08.880 --> 25:11.080
Girls, the light's gone out.

25:42.759 --> 25:43.640
June?

25:56.519 --> 25:57.319
June?

29:23.319 --> 29:25.158
Oh, June, hi.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.158
Um sorry, I.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.478
Nancy said it would be a good
idea to start packing things,

29:29.480 --> 29:30.920
but maybe it's too soon?

29:33.839 --> 29:34.718
No.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.400
No, it's fine, that's why we're
here.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.878
Wow, it must be a
bit weird seeing

29:43.880 --> 29:45.958
me with all your possessions.

29:45.960 --> 29:46.960
Honestly it's fine.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.519
You all right?

29:52.960 --> 29:56.400
I just feel like I'm
leaving them behind.

29:58.119 --> 29:59.158
Yeah.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.158
I can understand that,

30:00.160 --> 30:03.198
but it's really good you
know, for your progress.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.918
Getting rid of everything,
clearing out the past.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.117
It's probably what you need
to really move forward.

30:15.839 --> 30:17.399
You're never leaving them
behind.

30:18.359 --> 30:21.837
You know, if you ever want
them near you, your family,

30:21.839 --> 30:24.557
all you have to do is close your
eyes

30:24.559 --> 30:26.597
and imagine that they're
there in your mind,

30:26.599 --> 30:28.398
that you can see them.

30:28.400 --> 30:32.198
And if you do that, they're
with you, you can feel them.

30:32.200 --> 30:36.080
I know that when my mother
died, god rest her soul.

30:37.359 --> 30:38.238
That's what I used to do,

30:38.240 --> 30:40.438
and still do, to keep her close
to me.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.039
I close my eyes and I
imagine that she's there.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.638
And she is, she really is.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.960
You wanna give it a go?

30:50.319 --> 30:53.117
Wow, my brother really
was a hoarder, wasn't he?

30:53.119 --> 30:55.958
Well, I wasn't going to say
anything

30:55.960 --> 30:57.238
but you really shoulda probably
binned

30:57.240 --> 30:58.480
all this stuff years ago.

31:15.079 --> 31:16.279
Do you know what this is?

31:19.119 --> 31:20.277
It's a necklace?

31:20.279 --> 31:25.039
No, it's a pendant and I
can use it to hypnotize you.

31:27.480 --> 31:28.678
Oh, Karen.

31:28.680 --> 31:32.117
Well, if you don't want
to, I won't, but hear me out.

31:32.119 --> 31:34.438
There's a reason why people use
hypnosis,

31:34.440 --> 31:36.000
it's because it works.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.357
Sorry.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.240
Keep going.

31:46.119 --> 31:47.638
There's something wrong in
your mind,

31:47.640 --> 31:50.678
there's something in there
that's trapped in your memories.

31:50.680 --> 31:54.158
This is a way that I can go
in and talk to your psyche.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.317
Get right inside there and
unlock whatever

31:57.319 --> 31:59.519
that trauma is that's holding
you back.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.317
It's perfectly safe.

32:02.319 --> 32:04.638
We can stop anytime you want.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.037
I've got a really good feeling
this

32:06.039 --> 32:07.517
is gonna really help
you with your recovery.

32:07.519 --> 32:09.638
Do you think it'll work?

32:09.640 --> 32:11.317
I know it'll work.

32:11.319 --> 32:12.919
Why don't we just give it a go?

32:13.680 --> 32:16.519
It's not gonna harm you,
we can stop at any time.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.517
You're not in any danger.

32:19.519 --> 32:21.319
I just think we should
give it a go.

32:24.599 --> 32:26.319
Okay, let's give it a go.

32:30.119 --> 32:30.959
Okay.

32:33.079 --> 32:35.119
Sorry, am I interrupting
something?

32:36.720 --> 32:39.200
And what is up with this
fucked up lighting, girls?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.438
Listen to my words.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.160
Listen to my voice as
it washes over you.

32:54.440 --> 32:59.240
Feel your eyes as they
start to get very heavy.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.320
You're falling deeper.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.120
And deeper.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.360
And deeper.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.279
And on the count of three.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.080
One,

33:13.160 --> 33:14.040
two,

33:15.079 --> 33:16.597
three.

33:16.599 --> 33:17.480
You're out.

33:19.319 --> 33:21.357
June, where are you?

33:21.359 --> 33:22.319
I'm in the barn.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.200
And who's with you,
June?

33:26.440 --> 33:27.320
My brother.

33:28.359 --> 33:30.039
What are you doing
in the barn?

33:30.799 --> 33:32.599
I'm looking
out the window.

33:34.039 --> 33:35.639
Tell me what
can you see?

33:37.039 --> 33:38.398
My mom.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.317
She's telling me not
to come out.

33:41.319 --> 33:42.597
She's telling me
to stay in here,

33:42.599 --> 33:45.478
it's dangerous out there,
I'm scared.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.198
He's bleeding.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.678
Who's bleeding?

33:48.680 --> 33:49.757
And my dad, he's there.

33:49.759 --> 33:52.398
She's gone to get the
keys, and my dad's there.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.360
He's bleeding.

33:54.519 --> 33:55.440
He's cut.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.439
He's got a cut on him.

34:00.480 --> 34:03.478
He's bleeding, and my mom, she's
telling me not to come out.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.638
Who else is there, June?

34:04.640 --> 34:06.040
Tell me who else is there.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.277
Oh, he's there!

34:11.440 --> 34:14.157
- Tell me what he looks like.
- He's there, he's there.

34:14.159 --> 34:15.319
Who is he, June?

34:16.280 --> 34:18.277
I can hear the bell.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.597
There's a bell, I can hear it.

34:20.599 --> 34:21.518
Who is it?

34:22.679 --> 34:24.159
It's a scarecrow.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.556
He's there, he's coming for me.

34:28.559 --> 34:30.157
- It's not a scarecrow, June.
- He's coming for me.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.797
- Who is he?
- He's coming for me.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.277
- Tell me who it is.
- He's coming for me,

34:34.280 --> 34:37.318
he's coming, he's coming, he's
going to kill me, it's him.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.117
All right, June,

34:38.119 --> 34:39.358
- snap out of it now.
- He's here.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.878
Scarecrow, it's a scarecrow!

34:40.880 --> 34:42.077
It's a scarecrow.

34:42.079 --> 34:42.878
Wake her up.

34:42.880 --> 34:43.878
Why is she not waking up?

34:43.880 --> 34:46.157
It's a scarecrow,
it's a scarecrow!

34:46.159 --> 34:47.878
June, snap out of it now,
June.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.757
Back here, June.

34:49.760 --> 34:50.639
June?

34:53.360 --> 34:54.237
It's all right.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.157
You all right?

34:56.159 --> 34:57.438
Okay?

34:57.440 --> 34:58.280
Yeah.

35:03.039 --> 35:03.840
Who was it?

35:07.440 --> 35:08.280
Who was it?

35:14.440 --> 35:15.559
Who did I see?

35:40.559 --> 35:43.758
You can say it.

35:43.760 --> 35:44.720
Say what?

35:46.320 --> 35:47.440
You think I'm crazy.

35:49.639 --> 35:51.199
I don't think you're crazy.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.318
I just told you the guy
that killed my parents

35:55.320 --> 35:56.840
is a fucking scarecrow.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.800
Doesn't get much more fucked up
than that.

36:06.840 --> 36:09.400
I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

36:11.559 --> 36:13.838
You had a really traumatic
time as a child and your brain

36:13.840 --> 36:17.519
just doesn't want you to
relive that and who would?

36:25.760 --> 36:27.760
I just wanna remember.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.280
I want justice.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.599
Flying rats with wings.

36:45.679 --> 36:46.559
I hate crows.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.199
It's like they heard me.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.639
I think something scared them.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.677
Right.

37:04.679 --> 37:06.319
Show me where you grew up.

37:07.519 --> 37:08.400
Okay.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.840
Excuse me, can I help you?

37:25.159 --> 37:25.960
Who are you?

37:27.639 --> 37:28.960
Sorry, who are you?

37:30.519 --> 37:31.398
Where's Carl?

37:31.400 --> 37:32.280
Carl Summers?

37:34.039 --> 37:34.880
Oh.

37:36.840 --> 37:37.720
You haven't heard.

37:40.159 --> 37:41.000
Heard?

37:42.840 --> 37:45.880
I'm sorry, but Carl died.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.478
Died?

37:49.480 --> 37:51.360
Yeah, suicide.

37:53.639 --> 37:54.679
Sorry to hear that.

37:58.360 --> 38:02.360
Look, I'm Dean Rodge from
Cannings Farm just up the road.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.717
My niece, Chanel, someone
said that they seen

38:07.719 --> 38:09.998
her up here last night.

38:10.000 --> 38:10.880
You seen her?

38:12.440 --> 38:13.637
No.

38:13.639 --> 38:16.677
No, I'm staying here with
Carl's sister and her friend.

38:16.679 --> 38:17.597
We're here on our own.

38:17.599 --> 38:18.799
There's no one else here.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.280
Redhead, American.

38:24.639 --> 38:25.478
You seen her?

38:25.480 --> 38:26.637
Oh, yeah.

38:26.639 --> 38:28.077
Yeah, I have seen her.

38:28.079 --> 38:29.798
Yesterday, she.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.037
She was along the track.

38:31.039 --> 38:33.398
She pointed us in the right
direction of how to get here.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.478
We asked her for directions.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.677
So she was here?

38:36.679 --> 38:37.798
No, she wasn't here.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.478
She was over there.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.440
When was this?

38:41.800 --> 38:42.677
Midday?

38:42.679 --> 38:43.798
No.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.557
Last night they said
they seen her.

38:45.559 --> 38:46.798
Last night, when she was
up here walking with her...

38:46.800 --> 38:48.398
No, no.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.680
No one was here last night.

38:51.960 --> 38:52.878
Look, I'm just up the road.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.640
If you see her you call me,
all right?

38:56.519 --> 38:57.998
I'm getting worried.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Okay, bye.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.719
How hippy was she with this?

39:14.920 --> 39:16.519
She must be old.

39:19.519 --> 39:20.960
I just call it vintage.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.360
Old but gold.

40:24.599 --> 40:26.799
Your brother ain't playing.

40:50.920 --> 40:55.717
So you think you're definitely
gonna sell the place then?

40:55.719 --> 40:56.838
Yeah.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.197
I guess I don't really have an
option

40:58.199 --> 40:59.517
with the memories and
everything.

40:59.519 --> 41:01.637
I don't wanna be here, so yeah.

41:01.639 --> 41:04.559
I reckon you could make
a good buck for it, though.

41:08.639 --> 41:10.037
Look at this.

41:10.039 --> 41:10.880
Shit.

41:17.519 --> 41:19.878
The mystery of the 1978 killings

41:19.880 --> 41:22.677
is still gripping the village.

41:22.679 --> 41:25.197
Children claim to have seen
sightings of scarecrows

41:25.199 --> 41:26.958
moving in the area.

41:26.960 --> 41:30.677
No one knows what or where
these rumors started from

41:30.679 --> 41:33.278
but there are rumors that
the scarecrow activity

41:33.280 --> 41:35.880
has seen as far as Cheshunt.

41:38.239 --> 41:41.237
The makings of an urban
legend are with the rumors

41:41.239 --> 41:43.197
although each apparent
sighting of the murders

41:43.199 --> 41:45.199
has a slightly different
look to it.

41:48.239 --> 41:52.639
The 1958 murders at the Old
Manor blamed on scarecrows.

41:54.119 --> 41:58.998
So, your parents bought the
manor knowing

41:59.000 --> 42:01.318
that the murders had happened.

42:01.320 --> 42:04.960
Yeah, but, it keeps
happening on the land.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.998
Yeah, but it's like a house
in the middle of nowhere.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.199
Of course there's gonna
be unexplained killings.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.640
Every 20 years?

42:15.320 --> 42:17.758
No, I just think your
brother would say anything

42:17.760 --> 42:19.720
just to make his story viable.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.240
Dunno.

42:27.679 --> 42:30.677
Look, I've got something to
show you.

42:30.679 --> 42:31.599
Come with me.

42:33.320 --> 42:34.758
Where are you taking me?

42:34.760 --> 42:35.958
I've got something to
show you.

42:35.960 --> 42:36.840
Come on.

42:42.159 --> 42:43.000
Come on.

42:48.679 --> 42:51.758
No, not interested
at all.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.800
It's just a scarecrow.

42:55.519 --> 42:56.320
I'm good here.

42:58.119 --> 42:59.319
It's just a dummy.

43:02.199 --> 43:03.079
Look.

43:06.239 --> 43:07.559
It's a dummy.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.200
Come on.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.000
I'm all right.

43:16.119 --> 43:17.157
Come on, look, it's
good

43:17.159 --> 43:18.358
- for you to touch it.
- I'm okay!

43:18.360 --> 43:19.240
I promise.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.360
It's just made of hay.

43:26.039 --> 43:27.360
Come on, touch it, come on.

43:29.039 --> 43:29.920
Okay.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.000
Yep, yep, all good.

43:36.880 --> 43:37.918
Got it, cool.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.200
- It's hay.
- June.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.358
I believe you.

43:41.360 --> 43:43.037
Come on, it's time
to face your fears.

43:43.039 --> 43:43.918
Come on.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.318
Come on.

43:45.320 --> 43:46.640
It's for the birds.

43:47.880 --> 43:48.878
I believe you.

43:49.880 --> 43:50.758
Good!

43:50.760 --> 43:51.600
Let's go.

43:54.199 --> 43:55.157
Come on.

43:55.159 --> 43:57.000
As your friend
right now, do it.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.677
Oh god.

44:00.679 --> 44:02.237
Okay.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.998
Yep.

44:24.000 --> 44:24.918
All righty.

44:24.920 --> 44:25.958
See, I trusted you.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.079
Get outta here!

45:35.079 --> 45:37.000
Oh my god, these dates.

45:38.800 --> 45:40.720
It happens every 20 years.

46:29.079 --> 46:30.279
Couldn't sleep?

46:33.400 --> 46:34.358
Was that you?

46:34.360 --> 46:35.998
What?

46:36.000 --> 46:36.880
The bell?

46:40.280 --> 46:41.918
No.

46:41.920 --> 46:42.760
What bell?

46:47.599 --> 46:48.960
Don't worry about it.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.077
I've got a sneaky
bottle of wine in my case.

46:52.079 --> 46:54.199
Do you want to come and
join me for a drink?

46:58.360 --> 46:59.200
Sure.

47:18.519 --> 47:19.440
I mean, I like.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.079
There is so much stuff
written about it all.

47:26.440 --> 47:28.278
I don't understand how
it wouldn't make sense.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.077
It doesn't make
sense for it not.

47:30.079 --> 47:32.360
Why would people keep
writing about this stuff?

47:34.559 --> 47:36.599
I don't want you to
think that I'm crazy.

47:41.320 --> 47:42.960
Actually, don't worry about it.

47:44.639 --> 47:46.517
June, you don't think
that all the years

47:46.519 --> 47:49.157
I've been doing this that
I've heard far crazier stories

47:49.159 --> 47:51.358
than the things that
you're saying?

47:51.360 --> 47:53.160
Why don't you just
tell me what it is.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.240
I found these sketches
that my brother saved.

48:06.440 --> 48:08.880
And it triggered some
kind of memory?

48:09.639 --> 48:11.079
They're of the scarecrow.

48:16.679 --> 48:17.519
Look.

48:20.920 --> 48:22.077
Doesn't it look familiar?

48:22.079 --> 48:22.960
Well.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.278
They're exactly the same.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.358
Perhaps, but.

48:28.360 --> 48:29.358
They match.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.880
Yes, but that could
just be a coincidence.

48:34.920 --> 48:38.157
A coi-, a coincidence
that every 20 years someone

48:38.159 --> 48:40.159
on this land dies or gets
murdered or?

48:41.320 --> 48:42.200
Like.

48:45.079 --> 48:46.637
Don't tell me that you
came back here

48:46.639 --> 48:49.037
to just try and find this
scarecrow.

48:49.039 --> 48:50.318
Look.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.519
I just feel like there is.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.557
How can it.

48:54.559 --> 48:57.197
There's so much stuff.

48:57.199 --> 48:59.597
I don't think it was a good
idea you coming back here

48:59.599 --> 49:02.197
and I think I've misled
you somehow.

49:02.199 --> 49:04.517
I think you made so much
progress and being here

49:04.519 --> 49:06.920
has just like sent
you back a bit.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.237
You being back here, I
don't think it's helped.

49:10.239 --> 49:12.037
You were making so much progress

49:12.039 --> 49:14.480
and now I feel that it's
just pushed you backwards.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.438
This sketch of the scarecrow,

49:18.440 --> 49:20.320
it is exactly what I remember.

49:22.519 --> 49:23.438
June.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.119
All scarecrows look alike.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.160
You must think that I'm crazy.

49:37.199 --> 49:39.157
June, I don't think
you're crazy,

49:39.159 --> 49:41.517
but I think your
brother being here,

49:41.519 --> 49:44.358
it's stopped him being
able to move forwards

49:44.360 --> 49:46.517
and I think that you
coming back here

49:46.519 --> 49:50.159
seriously has hampered your
progression in your recovery.

49:51.599 --> 49:53.117
I think I've mislead you.

49:53.119 --> 49:54.717
I don't think we
should've come back here...

49:54.719 --> 49:55.559
Listen to this.

49:58.719 --> 50:02.758
"It's said that a scarecrow
returns each 20 years

50:02.760 --> 50:06.597
"after a terrible crime
which took place in the 1800s

50:06.599 --> 50:09.318
"where a man was brutally
strung up by the locals

50:09.320 --> 50:10.798
"in the fields of Belgrave.

50:10.800 --> 50:14.000
"A man died, cursing
the town to rise again

50:15.480 --> 50:18.677
"which he later then
did two decades later.

50:18.679 --> 50:22.399
"Murders on the land,
sightings of a scarecrow.

50:23.519 --> 50:27.157
"No way to stop it, but the
two days in which it stalks

50:27.159 --> 50:29.319
"the lands to allow his soul to
roam."

50:30.400 --> 50:33.438
I mean, I think that's why
my brother was staying here.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.360
He wanted to get it
once and for all.

50:36.320 --> 50:37.400
This is real.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.798
So you're trying' to
tell me that the two days

50:41.800 --> 50:44.519
that the scarecrow
rises are now?

50:46.159 --> 50:47.039
Really?

50:51.559 --> 50:54.039
My parents were murdered
20 years ago today.

50:55.159 --> 50:56.039
So.

50:59.320 --> 51:00.197
Right, that's it.

51:00.199 --> 51:00.998
I've had enough.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.717
Come on, you're coming with me.

51:02.719 --> 51:03.639
I've got an idea.

51:05.639 --> 51:06.480
Come.

51:19.679 --> 51:21.440
Right, June, come with me.

51:22.440 --> 51:23.237
Come on.

51:23.239 --> 51:25.037
I know exactly what
I'm gonna do.

51:25.039 --> 51:25.838
I'm gonna fix you.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.157
Karen.

51:27.159 --> 51:28.759
You need to face your fears.

51:29.679 --> 51:31.637
Take a look at this.

51:31.639 --> 51:32.637
What do you see?

51:32.639 --> 51:34.717
Karen, I don't want to.

51:34.719 --> 51:36.239
What do you see?

51:39.159 --> 51:41.358
A scarecrow, yeah?

51:41.360 --> 51:42.557
A scarecrow.

51:42.559 --> 51:44.478
Nothing alive about it.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.878
There's nothing there
that's gonna hurt you.

51:46.880 --> 51:49.117
It's not dangerous.

51:49.119 --> 51:53.077
It's just a big lump of straw,
that's it.

51:53.079 --> 51:53.878
Do you get it now?

51:53.880 --> 51:54.717
Do you get it in your head?

51:54.719 --> 51:57.159
I don't like this at all,
Karen.

51:59.519 --> 52:01.478
All right, I'll tell
you what we're gonna do.

52:01.480 --> 52:03.677
We're gonna unmask your killer.

52:03.679 --> 52:06.519
Let's unmask him and
see what he looks like.

52:08.719 --> 52:11.878
Hey guys, what are you
guys doing out so late?

52:11.880 --> 52:14.597
I'm trying to show
June that the scarecrow,

52:14.599 --> 52:17.918
this fear that she has for
him, is totally unfounded.

52:17.920 --> 52:20.878
It's just something, a
figment of her imagination.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.438
It's got to stop.

52:22.440 --> 52:25.677
There is nothing scary
about this.

52:25.679 --> 52:26.517
There's not.

52:26.519 --> 52:27.400
It's not real.

52:28.639 --> 52:30.438
I know what we'll do.

52:30.440 --> 52:32.197
We'll unmask the killer.

52:32.199 --> 52:33.517
Are you ready?

52:33.519 --> 52:38.677
Let's see what is behind
the mask once and for all.

52:38.679 --> 52:40.478
On the count of three.

52:40.480 --> 52:41.320
One.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.480
Two.

52:44.679 --> 52:45.717
Three!

52:49.840 --> 52:50.720
Oh my god!

52:53.679 --> 52:54.557
It's.

52:54.559 --> 52:55.759
It's that girl.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.878
What's that?

52:58.880 --> 52:59.760
What?

53:08.880 --> 53:10.200
Who's there?

53:11.280 --> 53:12.717
Show yourself!

53:12.719 --> 53:14.919
Somebody's messing
about with us.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.318
I see what we're gonna do.

53:18.320 --> 53:21.278
We can all go back
and still run for it.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.157
All right?

53:22.159 --> 53:22.958
- Okay.
- Yes.

53:22.960 --> 53:25.637
On the count of three.

53:25.639 --> 53:26.519
One.

53:27.679 --> 53:28.559
Two.

53:29.960 --> 53:30.798
Three!

53:35.800 --> 53:36.880
Run, run run!

53:39.440 --> 53:40.717
What the hell just happened?

53:40.719 --> 53:44.278
Come on, Karen, you
saw it with your eyes.

53:44.280 --> 53:46.557
I don't know what I saw.

53:46.559 --> 53:48.197
It was just an animal or
something.

53:48.199 --> 53:48.998
It wasn't an animal.

53:49.000 --> 53:49.838
An animal?

53:49.840 --> 53:50.798
Oh my god.

53:50.800 --> 53:53.838
My brother was right,
this land is cursed.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.878
Please tell me you
saw what I saw.

53:55.880 --> 53:59.318
Well, whatever it was we
need to get hell out of here.

53:59.320 --> 54:01.798
Does anyone have a
mobile phone or anything?

54:01.800 --> 54:02.838
Mobile phone?

54:02.840 --> 54:05.157
No one's got any signal
anywhere out here, anyway.

54:05.159 --> 54:05.998
Okay, well go.

54:06.000 --> 54:06.840
Go go go.

54:25.800 --> 54:26.878
Fuck.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.640
Fucking phone's out.

54:33.039 --> 54:35.037
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

54:35.039 --> 54:36.278
I gotta think.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.398
Think, think, think.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.398
I got it.

54:39.400 --> 54:41.677
Tell you what we're gonna do.

54:41.679 --> 54:43.438
I'm gonna go and the car,

54:43.440 --> 54:44.557
I'm gonna drive
to the next town,

54:44.559 --> 54:45.998
there's gotta be one nearby.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.557
I'm gonna raise the alarm,
get them to come back

54:48.559 --> 54:49.597
and send help for you.

54:49.599 --> 54:50.878
Back?

54:50.880 --> 54:52.077
No, you're not going
out there on your own

54:52.079 --> 54:53.360
with that thing there.

54:54.199 --> 54:55.000
No.

54:57.480 --> 54:59.519
Don't know what the
fuck else to do, June.

55:00.599 --> 55:03.480
We can't just sit here and
wait for it to come and get us.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.878
That thing.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.318
Thing?

55:08.320 --> 55:09.597
Thing?

55:09.599 --> 55:10.677
You saw it, didn't you?

55:10.679 --> 55:12.480
Please tell me that you saw it.

55:15.880 --> 55:16.720
Yeah.

55:18.719 --> 55:20.077
Yeah.

55:20.079 --> 55:21.918
So my brother was right.

55:21.920 --> 55:24.280
The curse of the scarecrow,
it's real.

55:27.719 --> 55:29.319
Yeah, it's real.

55:43.639 --> 55:44.679
What are we gonna do?

55:48.000 --> 55:49.400
I don't know.

55:50.599 --> 55:53.117
But I tell you what,
I'm not gonna sit here

55:53.119 --> 55:55.079
and wait for that
thing to come back.

55:56.599 --> 55:59.918
We're gonna fight it, we're
gonna stay up all night,

55:59.920 --> 56:01.478
we're gonna survive.

56:01.480 --> 56:03.519
We just have to
survive the night.

56:11.039 --> 56:12.759
I need to show you something.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.720
We have to clean
that thing up, come on.

56:42.639 --> 56:44.037
Oh god.

56:44.039 --> 56:44.918
Ah.

56:44.920 --> 56:45.760
I need some tissue.

56:53.440 --> 56:54.677
Ah.

56:54.679 --> 56:55.559
It's fine.

56:56.800 --> 56:57.640
Ow.

57:05.519 --> 57:06.960
I've got something
to show you.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.640
Okay, there has to
be something here.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.157
There's gotta be
something in here,

57:19.159 --> 57:22.077
there has to be
something in here.

57:22.079 --> 57:23.920
Otherwise why would
he keep them?

57:27.440 --> 57:30.077
Okay, so this all the
stuff my brother kept.

57:30.079 --> 57:30.960
All they say it.

57:32.800 --> 57:34.000
What is this?

57:35.719 --> 57:37.597
It's all his research, but,

57:37.599 --> 57:40.920
there's gotta be something
in here for it to tie in.

57:44.840 --> 57:48.160
But these dates,
they go back for years.

57:50.960 --> 57:51.878
They're the same.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.960
They go back hundreds
of years.

57:59.840 --> 58:03.117
Every 20 years people
go missing, they die.

58:03.119 --> 58:04.838
They disappear.

58:04.840 --> 58:06.440
Or they say that they've seen.

58:07.119 --> 58:08.159
That they've seen it.

58:14.920 --> 58:15.800
The scarecrow.

58:25.119 --> 58:26.000
Look.

58:28.800 --> 58:30.677
It's not a coincidence,
it can't be.

58:30.679 --> 58:31.679
It can't be.

58:32.559 --> 58:34.719
But these are in
all different areas.

58:36.800 --> 58:37.680
It's everywhere.

58:38.599 --> 58:40.079
There could be hundreds of them.

58:41.679 --> 58:42.879
Oh my god.

58:51.320 --> 58:53.200
June, all of these people.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.039
You think there's more
of them out there?

59:31.760 --> 59:34.560
June, I don't know what
the fuck to believe anymore.

59:35.599 --> 59:38.117
It's okay, it's fine,
I understand.

59:38.119 --> 59:38.998
Have you seen him?

59:39.000 --> 59:40.157
Have you seen anything?

59:40.159 --> 59:41.159
No, nothing.

59:42.960 --> 59:45.679
I can't stay here, I'm
gonna go and get some help.

59:46.639 --> 59:47.918
What, no you're not going.

59:47.920 --> 59:49.278
I've worked it out.

59:49.280 --> 59:51.077
I'm gonna go over
there to your car,

59:51.079 --> 59:52.958
I'm gonna drive
to the next village,

59:52.960 --> 59:54.717
I'm gonna raise the
alarm and then I'm

59:54.719 --> 59:56.237
gonna come back and
rescue you two.

59:56.239 --> 59:57.077
All right?

59:57.079 --> 59:58.117
Then we're coming with you.

59:58.119 --> 59:59.157
Oh, no you're not.

59:59.159 --> 01:00:01.278
You stay here where you're safe.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.557
All right, wish me luck.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.157
- Karen.
- Karen, Karen.

01:00:06.159 --> 01:00:08.798
Karen, be careful.

01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:23.719
Come on, come on.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.000
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.680
Why isn't she going?

01:01:34.079 --> 01:01:35.799
Karen, behind you!

01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:00.079
Karen, run!

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.160
What?

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.720
I dunno, stab him in the hay?

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.840
- I just...
- What?

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.280
I'm so sorry.

01:02:57.079 --> 01:03:01.918
I'm so sorry, I just thought
it was an urban legend.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.077
No, it's okay, it's okay.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.840
I would never of
believed me either.

01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:13.199
We really shouldn't of let
Karen run out there on her own.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.160
Come on.

01:03:49.239 --> 01:03:50.399
What do we do?

01:03:56.039 --> 01:03:57.358
What?

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.200
The gun.

01:03:59.599 --> 01:04:00.480
A gun?

01:04:04.199 --> 01:04:06.398
I found it in
your brother's barn.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.878
Okay.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.037
A gun.

01:04:10.039 --> 01:04:13.199
Yeah, the gun in your
brother's barn.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.559
I'll be quick.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.637
Nancy, are you serious?

01:04:23.639 --> 01:04:24.879
No fucking way.

01:04:30.159 --> 01:04:31.039
Listen.

01:04:32.559 --> 01:04:33.478
I'm gonna go.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.398
It's not happening.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.597
You're not going.

01:04:36.599 --> 01:04:38.438
- And if you hear anything
- No.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:43.039
And I mean anything,
you shout as loud

01:04:46.039 --> 01:04:46.880
as you can.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.157
You just saw what
happened to Karen.

01:04:51.159 --> 01:04:54.157
It is out there, it is alive.

01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:55.199
You're not going.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.637
No, I can't lose you, too.

01:04:57.639 --> 01:04:59.559
You won't, I promise.

01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:02.159
I've got a weapon.

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:06.119
I'm gonna upgrade this bitch.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.360
Besides, they set
after Karen anyway.

01:05:33.159 --> 01:05:34.039
June?

01:05:40.679 --> 01:05:43.199
June, I've dropped the knife!

01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:29.197
Help me!

01:07:29.199 --> 01:07:30.039
Help me!

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:37.239
Oh, thank god.

01:07:40.159 --> 01:07:41.117
Can you try to help me?

01:07:41.119 --> 01:07:43.559
You're the woman from
the Summers' place.

01:07:46.639 --> 01:07:48.677
What is it, what's going on?

01:07:48.679 --> 01:07:51.597
You will never believe me.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.277
If any of us still smoked,

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:44.439
I woulda set fire to you,
you bag of shit.

01:08:47.238 --> 01:08:48.760
It's the curse of the
scarecrow.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.437
What, you know about this?

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:54.238
We all do, everyone in
the town knows the legend.

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:56.758
It's real?

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.640
It is.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:10.277
Hey, where are you taking me?

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.798
I told you to take me
where there's a phone.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.558
We're going backwards.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.319
We're going the way to the farm.

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:20.317
Hey.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.598
I said where are you taking me?

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.477
Take me back there!

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:24.319
I am.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.877
Stop the car!

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.317
Stop the car now!

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.437
I'm getting out.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:43.639
Let me get out.

01:10:40.359 --> 01:10:41.199
Nancy.

01:10:46.279 --> 01:10:47.399
Where are you?

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.440
Nancy.

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:17.239
Nance?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:20.840
Nancy?

01:12:18.279 --> 01:12:19.117
June!

01:12:19.119 --> 01:12:20.558
June!

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.440
June!

01:12:27.439 --> 01:12:29.958
This man, this man is a local.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.878
He was supposed to
take me for help

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.480
but he's brought me back here.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.640
Oh god.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.000
Don't fucking move.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.800
What's going on?

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.437
It's got my niece.

01:12:50.439 --> 01:12:51.277
Where is she?

01:12:52.079 --> 01:12:53.600
Your niece, oh.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.600
She's dead.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.437
He killed her.

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:58.559
Where is she?

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.077
She's dead.

01:13:02.079 --> 01:13:03.559
We found her body.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.720
Mister.

01:13:08.039 --> 01:13:09.800
We've gotta get out of here,
okay?

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.360
We've gotta get out of here.

01:13:13.479 --> 01:13:14.919
He can't be stopped.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.560
We can't stop them
until the sun rises.

01:13:22.479 --> 01:13:24.077
What do you mean?

01:13:24.079 --> 01:13:29.039
This won't be over until
the 48 hour reign is finished.

01:13:30.119 --> 01:13:34.157
We've got two hours
till sunrise.

01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:38.197
This is the curse of the
scarecrow.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.079
Behind you.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.119
He's behind you.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:56.800
Karen.

01:13:58.199 --> 01:13:59.399
June, run.

01:14:00.119 --> 01:14:01.000
Run!

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:06.800
Wait.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.400
Karen, he's coming.

01:16:11.079 --> 01:16:12.237
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:14.197
No, please, no, no, please.

01:16:14.199 --> 01:16:16.838
Please, I am just like you,
okay?

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:17.958
I am just like you.

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:21.039
I know what happened
with the locals.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.678
Okay.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.037
I know what happened
with the locals

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:27.037
many many many years ago.

01:16:27.039 --> 01:16:29.838
I know they strung you out
and they starved you, okay?

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.159
I know all about that, okay?

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.598
Okay.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.960
I am just like you.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.357
I'm exactly like you.

01:16:39.359 --> 01:16:42.559
I would never, I would
never do that, okay?

01:16:43.239 --> 01:16:44.958
I know that they starved you.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.758
I know that they tortured you.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.600
That you didn't eat
anything, so I understand.

01:16:52.119 --> 01:16:53.760
Okay, I'm so sorry.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:56.800
Okay.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I am so sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

01:17:03.199 --> 01:17:04.798
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.998
I am so sorry that
happened to you.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.958
I am so sorry, I am so sorry.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.397
I am so sorry.

01:17:11.399 --> 01:17:12.279
Okay.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:28.918
Karen!

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.000
Are you okay?

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:52.039
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.397
How you feeling' now?

01:19:19.399 --> 01:19:21.719
Now that it's all done,
it's all over.

01:19:23.439 --> 01:19:25.157
No one's gonna believe us.

01:19:25.159 --> 01:19:26.720
No one has to.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.157
So what do we do?

01:19:31.159 --> 01:19:33.998
We just wait for the next 20
years and he's gonna come back?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.277
Yeah.

01:19:35.279 --> 01:19:36.840
We'll be ready for them then.

01:19:40.479 --> 01:19:41.399
Are you all right?

01:19:44.199 --> 01:19:45.157
Yeah.

01:19:45.159 --> 01:19:46.880
Can you wait one minute?

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:23.199
June!

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.558
The souls of the
victims are trapped.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:34.480
They are cursed to suffer the
same fate as the scarecrow.

01:20:38.399 --> 01:20:39.239
Oh my god.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.960
There are more of them.

01:20:54.279 --> 01:20:55.159
June!

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.880
Karen.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.440
June!

01:21:10.039 --> 01:21:11.558
No!

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.440
No!
