00:56.500 --> 00:59.467
Good afternoon, freshmen,

00:59.540 --> 01:02.703
freshwomen and, uh,
people of freshness.

01:02.771 --> 01:06.349
Welcome to Stratford University's
freshman orientation.

01:06.419 --> 01:09.234
I'm your tour guide,
Darryl Witherspoon.

01:09.299 --> 01:11.949
I got another tour group in about
a half hour, so let's get to tourin'.

01:12.017 --> 01:14.319
Come on. Come on.
Speed walk. Speed walk.

01:14.385 --> 01:17.201
It's good for your soul.
That's it. You got it.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.503
So, as an economics major,

01:22.577 --> 01:24.911
this is where I spend
the majority of my time.

01:24.977 --> 01:28.457
And thanks to Stratford University's
top-notch financial aid program...

01:28.529 --> 01:34.092
[Coughs] Bullshit... I spend
the rest of my time giving tours,
working food services...

01:34.159 --> 01:37.127
and delivering campus mail.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.495
Now, this package has brought us
to the administration building.

01:40.559 --> 01:44.520
And here, encased in this glass...
No, it's not Superfly's pimp cane.

01:44.591 --> 01:48.714
This is the Truman Scepter.
This next package will be taking us...

01:48.782 --> 01:51.301
to the neuropsychology building.

01:51.374 --> 01:54.373
Let's go. Neuropsychology.
Let's go.

01:54.445 --> 01:56.649
- Let's go. Here you go.
Hold that for me. Thanks, baby.
- [Claps]

01:56.717 --> 01:59.684
Hey, we're gonna stop over
at the cafeteria and bust a little suds.

01:59.756 --> 02:02.058
Girls wash. Guys dry.
Whoo!

02:02.124 --> 02:05.472
And here we have
Stratford University's prizewinning...

02:05.548 --> 02:08.068
neuropsychology department.

02:08.139 --> 02:12.101
Oh, I just wanted to thank you
all for helping me out with
my campus maintenance duties.

02:12.171 --> 02:15.467
I think it's a beautiful thing.
But remember,

02:15.532 --> 02:18.051
plastic goes in the blue,
paper in the green.

02:18.123 --> 02:20.456
Be back in a jiff.
Whoo!

02:23.018 --> 02:26.400
Hello?

02:26.473 --> 02:30.302
Dr. Wheedon?
Got a package for you.

02:30.377 --> 02:33.825
Um, right there's fine.

02:33.896 --> 02:36.197
Thank you.

02:36.264 --> 02:39.494
Wow. That little fellow glows
in the dark, huh?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.894
I wish the ones at my mom's house
would glow in the dark.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.902
Um...

02:45.351 --> 02:47.685
Thank you.

02:51.911 --> 02:54.562
There's a building, building, building.

02:54.630 --> 02:57.280
That building's old.
That building got windows.

02:57.349 --> 03:02.084
And here we are,
back at Albert Lovett Library.

03:02.149 --> 03:06.491
And that, my friends,
is the end of your tour.

03:06.565 --> 03:11.648
And the beginning of yours.
Welcome.

03:11.715 --> 03:15.162
[Man] Gaining 13 and three quarters,
utilities up about a fifth of a point.

03:15.235 --> 03:18.400
- And the big-board composite
up.6 and 45236.
- [Phone Rings]

03:18.468 --> 03:21.948
- There were over 115 million
shares traded on the big board.
- [Sighs]

03:22.019 --> 03:24.507
- Yeah.
- [Woman On Phone] Hi. Darryl?

03:24.579 --> 03:26.650
Hey, Ma. How you doin'?

03:26.722 --> 03:29.057
Oh, same old, same old.
Blase, blase.

03:29.121 --> 03:32.318
The kids are drivin' me crazy,
stove don't work and the roaches
are gettin' attitude.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.622
So, when do you start
your new job on Wall Street?

03:34.689 --> 03:36.794
Well, I don't exactly
have the job.

03:36.865 --> 03:39.418
There's a lot of competition
for that Smythe-Bates job.

03:39.489 --> 03:42.389
My oldest son is gonna starve.

03:42.463 --> 03:45.398
- I'm not going to starve.
- How are you gonna pay your tuition?

03:45.473 --> 03:47.893
Ma, I'll just get
another job, okay?

03:47.967 --> 03:50.302
[Sighs] Well, you know,
I didn't want to say anything,

03:50.367 --> 03:52.637
but they threatened to turn off the gas.

03:52.704 --> 03:55.606
Just send me the bill.
How much is it?

03:55.678 --> 03:58.613
- $223.
- Damn, what you cookin'?

03:58.685 --> 04:02.395
Well, baby, we got to eat.
And you know I like to cook
everything down nice and slow.

04:02.462 --> 04:04.949
- You know.
- Uh, just send it, Ma.

04:05.022 --> 04:07.127
I didn't wanna tell you this,

04:07.198 --> 04:10.646
but, uh, you know I'm front-runner
for that Smythe-Bates job.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.756
I'm so proud of you.

04:12.829 --> 04:15.578
And the job pays $60,000 a year.

04:15.644 --> 04:20.051
- Oh, baby.
- So, you, Darius, Lyndell,
Brandon and April...

04:20.124 --> 04:22.490
Y'all don't have to worry.

04:22.555 --> 04:25.904
- I love you, Darryl.

[Woman] This is the Stratford
University tuition office.
May I speak to Darryl Witherspoon?

04:38.457 --> 04:42.035
Uh, no, uh, Darryl's not
with us anymore.

04:42.105 --> 04:44.526
He, uh, he die.

04:44.599 --> 04:48.494
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- [Tearfully]
Yeah, th-they killed my baby.

04:48.568 --> 04:50.673
He got involved with that whole
East Coast/West Coast thing,

04:50.745 --> 04:53.875
and being that he is from Chicago,
they both banged on him.

04:57.815 --> 05:01.230
Hi. Darryl Witherspoon.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.390

05:54.671 --> 05:57.487
Ooh!

06:01.743 --> 06:03.848
Have you donated sperm before?

06:03.919 --> 06:06.537
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. And you're familiar
with the procedure?

06:06.606 --> 06:08.711
Well, I've been doing it
since I was 12.

06:08.783 --> 06:12.841
The payment procedure. Fifty dollars
upon procurement of the sperm.

06:12.910 --> 06:17.994
Cool. Um, do you have
any of those procurement aids?

06:18.062 --> 06:21.607
Oh, certainly.
Dirty, Beaver Hunt, Big Butt.

06:30.987 --> 06:32.842
Ooh, four.

06:32.908 --> 06:36.223
I'm good for one more.
Just give me somethin' really freaky.

06:36.299 --> 06:39.746
- Like some Siamese midget twins
menaging a goat or somethin'.
- Okay.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.682
Ah, what's up?
What's happenin', my man?

06:44.746 --> 06:46.753
- Hey.
- Got some more hair for you.

06:46.826 --> 06:49.825
Hey, look man, I can't do nothin'
with them naps. You're back too soon.

06:49.898 --> 06:52.679
- Come on, man. I need this money, man.
- I can't help you.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.877
Please. Come on, man.
Hey, brother, look. I got some
real good hair for you, man.

06:55.945 --> 06:57.603
- Look at the bush.
- Hey, look.

06:57.673 --> 06:59.528
- It ain't that kind of party, man, hey.
- Come on. Look, brother.

06:59.593 --> 07:02.113
- I'll throw in the ass hair for free.
- Step!

07:07.623 --> 07:11.747
Oh, hey, dog. Landlord came by again,
looking for your part of the rent.

07:11.815 --> 07:14.663
- God, it must be nice having a...
- A hockey scholarship?

07:14.727 --> 07:18.207
Look, I'm not in the guilt game,
all right? My heart is light.

07:18.278 --> 07:21.540
- What's with the X?
- That's, uh...
That's a symbol of my pledge.

07:21.606 --> 07:23.515
See, I'm denying myself
certain pleasures, eh?

07:23.590 --> 07:25.499
Eating meat.
Drinking alcohol. Sex.

07:25.573 --> 07:28.867
- Sex?
- Yeah, all forms of sex.

07:28.932 --> 07:31.867
Consider this.
Without pain and deprivation,

07:31.940 --> 07:35.737
one can never experience
true pleasure.

07:35.812 --> 07:39.488
You know, this is just like when you
converted to Buddhism freshman year.

07:39.556 --> 07:44.377
Uh-huh? Then you went premed,
then Republican and then
the Tony Robbins tapes.

07:44.451 --> 07:46.972
And let's not forget
your little bisexual stage.

07:47.043 --> 07:51.068
Well, that just lasted two hours.
Well, two and a half.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.880
You try watchin' Brad Pitt
in Interview With A Vampire
and not feel a little conflicted.

07:54.947 --> 07:59.101
Look, man, all I'm sayin'...
pick an obsession, stay with it.

07:59.169 --> 08:00.860
- All right?
- Mmm.

08:00.929 --> 08:04.507
- [Metal Jangling]
- Okay, what's the new chiming sound?

08:04.577 --> 08:07.576
Oh, uh, that's
my Prince Albert.

08:07.649 --> 08:10.169
- A what?
- Yeah, I got a piercing
through my urethra.

08:10.241 --> 08:13.536
And I run a chain
from that to my scrotum.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.282
- Listen.
- [Ringing]

08:16.351 --> 08:18.739
Ohh.

08:20.895 --> 08:24.342
With piercing, uh,
it's about pain and pleasure.

08:24.415 --> 08:28.341
Like you, for instance, right?
You got that inner pain,
that hunger for success.

08:28.414 --> 08:33.149
And when you get it,
it's gonna be all the more sweet, dog.

08:35.227 --> 08:37.563
[Chattering]

08:43.323 --> 08:47.415
Hello, Darryl.
Runnin' low on bacon bits over here.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.785
- Hi, Scott.
- No emergency.

08:49.852 --> 08:51.739
Just somethin' to keep
in the back of your head.

08:51.803 --> 08:54.901
Oh, well, thank you for the pork report.
Appreciate it.

08:54.970 --> 08:57.489
- You going up for that Smythe-Bates job?
- Oh, yeah.

08:57.562 --> 09:00.409
I'm kind of the pace car

[Man Narrating] Smythe-Bates has
long enjoyed a reputation...

09:40.981 --> 09:43.316
as one of the world's premier
investment firms.

09:43.380 --> 09:48.082
That is why each year we choose our new
junior analysts with tremendous care.

09:48.148 --> 09:50.931
The Smythe-Bates man or woman
has a high G.P.A.,

09:50.996 --> 09:55.567
a record of athletic achievement
and ties of tradition
to our firm through some...

09:55.636 --> 09:58.091
of the more prominent
fraternal organizations on campus.

09:58.164 --> 10:01.873
Because we regard the junior analyst
position not as a stopping point,

10:01.938 --> 10:04.393
but as a stepping stone to greatness.

10:04.467 --> 10:06.441
[Video Clicks Off]

10:06.513 --> 10:10.026
Now, class, I would like for you
to extend a very warm welcome
to my old friend,

10:10.097 --> 10:13.032
Mr. Randall Tyson
of Smythe-Bates Brokers.

10:13.105 --> 10:16.847
- Randall?
- Thank you, Professor Engel.
Good to see you.

10:16.913 --> 10:21.898
Uh, well, this old room holds
many memories for me.

10:21.969 --> 10:26.408
- I logged quite a bit
of nap time in that back row.
- [Darryl Laughs Loudly]

10:26.481 --> 10:30.124
I sincerely wish that we had a place
for all of you,

10:30.193 --> 10:32.133
but that's not the case.

10:32.207 --> 10:36.036
Five of you will be chosen,
and out of the five finalists,

10:36.110 --> 10:39.557
the student who most closely resembles
the ideal employee...

10:39.630 --> 10:44.005
will be chosen for the position
of junior analyst at Smythe-Bates.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.085
Good luck to all of you.

10:46.158 --> 10:50.249
All right, class, in the case study
that we were examining last week...

10:50.317 --> 10:53.099
Now, the markets are up,
but consumer spending...

10:53.165 --> 10:55.466
and corporate profit margins are down.

10:55.532 --> 11:00.386
- Now, how would the social
planner remedy this, huh?
- [Darryl] Ooh!

11:00.459 --> 11:02.793
- [Boy] Sir?
- Downsize the labor force.

11:02.860 --> 11:05.315
- What?
- This increases profit,
and the resulting price cuts...

11:05.387 --> 11:07.753
stimulate consumer spending.

11:07.818 --> 11:12.641
- Yo, difference of opinion here.
- Uh, Mr. Witherspoon...
and we can do without the yo-ing...

11:12.714 --> 11:15.779
What he's sayin' is
let's help people by firing them.

11:15.850 --> 11:19.427
Now, this seems to me,
ebonically speaking, whack.

11:19.497 --> 11:22.563
Perhaps Darryl does have
a special insight into the blue collar,

11:22.633 --> 11:26.561
or, should I say,
hairnet mentality.

11:26.632 --> 11:28.639
Oh!
[Laughs]

11:28.712 --> 11:31.428
Look...
Wicks Morton Industrials, okay?

11:31.496 --> 11:36.100
In 1988, their wages exceeded
their profit margins,
but instead of firing people,

11:36.168 --> 11:40.259
what they did was they offered
employee contracts with wage givebacks.

11:40.327 --> 11:45.377
And guess what. Their employees
spent 50 percent more
than they did the previous year.

11:45.445 --> 11:48.380
Now, what that proves is what the
average Joe on the street already knows.

11:48.453 --> 11:51.585
The more money they have,
the more money they can spend.

11:51.653 --> 11:55.297
He's absolutely right. Wicks Morton did
do the right thing by their employees.

11:55.366 --> 11:59.194
But then again, instead of
laying off workers, they took
out a $20 million loan...

11:59.268 --> 12:02.301
from a certain bank here in Manhattan,
and from what I hear,

12:02.372 --> 12:04.859
- From your dad?
- They're on the verge of defaulting.

12:04.931 --> 12:09.535
So what happens to your average
workin' Joe when Wicks Morton goes down?

12:09.603 --> 12:11.546
I don't think they're gonna end up
in the checkout line.

12:11.620 --> 12:14.433
I think it's gonna be
the unemployment line.

12:14.499 --> 12:18.012
And the president of the company
is gonna be right there with them.

12:20.289 --> 12:23.770
Ebonically speaking,
you don't know shit.

12:25.281 --> 12:28.315
Dare I say,
you're out of your league.

12:34.689 --> 12:38.201
Darryl, although carrying water
is technically an aerobic activity,

12:38.272 --> 12:42.428
- it does not qualify you
to play college-level hockey.

Please, Coach.

Look, I'm just a brother from the hood
with a simple dream to play hockey.

12:48.447 --> 12:50.302
Don't make me turn
to drugs or gangs...

- LaFlour!

12:54.685 --> 12:59.191
- He's on your team.
- Just following through, Coach!

12:59.261 --> 13:01.979
- Yeah. Sure, Tim.
- [Grunts]
- Hey, Tim.

13:02.046 --> 13:04.313
When was the last time
you had sex?

13:04.381 --> 13:07.227
- Why?
- You're just a little jumpy,

01:13:54.372 --> 01:13:57.535
Dude, you've been studying
your ass off all night.

01:13:57.604 --> 01:14:01.859
- Put some faith in fate. You're the man.
- All right.

01:14:01.924 --> 01:14:05.535
I think this Protocol 563
is finally leaving my system.

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:11.709
- Hey, dog, I just wanted to thank...
- [Tim Moaning]

01:14:11.778 --> 01:14:14.014
- Forget it.
- I'll take care of the tip.

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:15.936
All right.

01:14:29.056 --> 01:14:30.844
Oh, no!

01:14:30.911 --> 01:14:32.767
No!

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.933
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

01:14:35.998 --> 01:14:38.748
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:14:38.815 --> 01:14:40.790
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi. Hey.

01:14:40.863 --> 01:14:42.718
- How you doing?
- Hey, listen.

01:14:42.783 --> 01:14:45.401
I was wondering if you could show me
where the Smythe-Bates building is.

01:14:45.471 --> 01:14:47.357
- You can't see?
- Mm-mm, no.

01:14:47.421 --> 01:14:51.218
- You visually in-com-paired?
- Impaired.

01:14:51.294 --> 01:14:53.433
Yeah, I can help you out, man.

01:14:53.502 --> 01:14:56.403
- Oh, thank you, man. Thank you, brother.
- Brothers gotta stick together.

01:14:56.476 --> 01:14:59.673
- Oh, definitely. Thank you, brother.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:59.741 --> 01:15:01.596
- You know, I know a shortcut.
- Oh, really?

01:15:01.661 --> 01:15:03.515
- Yeah. This way.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.263
- Quick, hurry.
- Thank God I met someone like you.

01:15:06.332 --> 01:15:08.982
- No, thank God I met somebody like you.
- Huh?

01:15:09.052 --> 01:15:11.538
- [Punches Landing]
- [Darryl Squealing]

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:20.086
[Car Horn Honks]

01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:33.714
[Woman Screaming]

01:15:35.065 --> 01:15:38.293
No, I don't have it.
Please, please...

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.425
Just leave me alone.
Go away! Stop it!

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:44.277
[People Chattering]

01:15:45.846 --> 01:15:48.564
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:50.671
[Rattling]

01:15:50.743 --> 01:15:54.899
Excuse me, sir. Can you show me where
the suits are? The drawers? Something.

01:15:54.966 --> 01:15:57.386
- This guy is on break
right here, brother.
- Oh, how you doing?

01:15:57.461 --> 01:16:00.428
- Maybe I can help you.
- I've got this interview
across the street in ten minutes.

01:16:00.502 --> 01:16:03.219
I just got robbed. That's why
I'm sitting in your store assed out.

01:16:03.286 --> 01:16:07.246
- Look! Literally!
- Yeah. Come on. Come on.
This way. Follow me.

01:16:07.316 --> 01:16:10.066
Listen, my man.
I got $50 in my right sock.

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.947
I need this suit. I will come back
tomorrow and pay you, I promise.

01:16:13.012 --> 01:16:16.240
- Okay. Young blind brother,
I'm gonna fix you up real good.
- My man.

01:16:16.307 --> 01:16:18.991
- [Woman] Smythe-Bates. May I help you?
- [Elevator Bell Dings]

01:16:19.061 --> 01:16:22.355
Excuse me.
Is this the 12th floor?

01:16:22.419 --> 01:16:25.385
- Yes. Sir, may I help you?
- Yes.

01:16:25.459 --> 01:16:27.314
Where's the men's room?

01:16:27.378 --> 01:16:29.385
[Exhales, Screams]

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.238
What the...

01:16:32.305 --> 01:16:35.338
No! I'll kill him!

01:16:35.408 --> 01:16:38.159
[Garbled] Aw, shit!
Oh, what else can go wrong?

01:16:38.225 --> 01:16:40.461
[Liquid Dribbling]

01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:45.258
No! No!
[Sobbing]

01:16:45.329 --> 01:16:47.913
No!

01:16:47.984 --> 01:16:50.221
No! [Sobbing]

01:16:50.288 --> 01:16:52.840
[Dr. Wheedon's Voice] The drug just
has to pass through your system.

01:16:52.911 --> 01:16:54.851
Trust me,
you'll know when it's gone.

01:16:54.927 --> 01:16:56.836
[Garbled]
Oh, no.

01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:59.331
[Garbled Speech]

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:02.123
[Panting]

01:17:04.718 --> 01:17:06.921
Together.

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:10.121
Get... your shit together.

01:17:11.949 --> 01:17:15.081
[Laughing]
I'm gonna pay you guys back.

01:17:16.908 --> 01:17:20.584
Can you believe me and the boys in
Leverage Buyout got into a water fight?

01:17:20.652 --> 01:17:23.913
No. They're ready
for you... now.

01:17:23.978 --> 01:17:27.808
- [Tyson] What time is it?
- [Proctor] Twenty after.

01:17:27.883 --> 01:17:31.592
I made it. You're going to have
to excuse the suit.

01:17:31.658 --> 01:17:34.473
Come to find out, I'm allergic
to everything but polyester.

01:17:34.538 --> 01:17:37.798
My, uh, doctor prescribed
this suit for me.

01:17:39.466 --> 01:17:41.733
Ladies and gentlemen,
we would like to welcome you...

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.972
here on this day
of final competition...

01:17:44.041 --> 01:17:46.309
for the position of junior analyst.

01:17:46.376 --> 01:17:49.442
And we'll begin our questioning
with you, Mr. Thorpe.

01:17:49.512 --> 01:17:52.611
Now, in structuring a portfolio
for your client,

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.013
what are the three
most important rules?

01:17:55.079 --> 01:17:58.275
Well, first thing I'd do is talk to
my client about his long-term goals.

01:17:58.343 --> 01:18:00.896
- Once those are explained to me...
- Goods and services...

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:03.749
are exempt from the discounting
which classical theory demands.

01:18:03.814 --> 01:18:07.197
The effect of taxes defined
by the Laffer Curve cannot
be considered as valid...

01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:12.027
The leverage gained by buying on
the market will multiply your returns...

01:18:12.101 --> 01:18:14.686
For our primary analysis,
equity can't be considered in
the same tier as secured debt.

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:18.105
Small cap funds overpower
high cap funds over time...

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:20.963
If the poison pill doesn't work,
you got a proxy war that's
gonna depress your price.

01:18:21.028 --> 01:18:23.395
[Proctor] At this point, we would
excuse three of our contestants.

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:26.722
Fine job.
Show them our appreciation.

01:18:26.787 --> 01:18:29.635
Mr. Auseppe, why would the Federal
Reserve have resorted to this?

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:33.179
I believe that would be in order to
maintain a constant rate of growth...

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:37.527
while avoiding incurring
any excess inflation.

01:18:37.602 --> 01:18:40.700
Thank you, Mr. Auseppe.
You may step down. And fine job.

01:18:40.769 --> 01:18:42.776
[Audience Applauding]

01:18:42.849 --> 01:18:44.987
Now, we are down
to our final two contestants:

01:18:45.058 --> 01:18:47.425
- Mr. Scott Thorpe...
- You lost your bitches, pimp daddy?

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:50.107
- And Mr. Darryl Witherspoon.
- What's up?

01:18:50.177 --> 01:18:52.348
Mr. Thorpe, if you were
to be given control...

01:18:52.416 --> 01:18:55.067
of the Smythe-Bates
venture capital fund,

01:18:55.137 --> 01:18:57.405
where would you take it
over the next five years?

01:18:57.472 --> 01:18:59.959
Well, I think start-up industries
in emerging markets...

01:19:00.031 --> 01:19:02.847
are the kind of low-risk,
high-gain strategy I would pursue.

01:19:02.912 --> 01:19:06.042
Ah, so the rich get richer
off the sweat of the poor, right, Scott?

01:19:06.111 --> 01:19:07.965
Maybe you should pay a visit...

01:19:08.031 --> 01:19:10.103
to one of those emerging markets
you're so eager to exploit.

01:19:10.174 --> 01:19:12.695
I summered in Cancun.

01:19:12.765 --> 01:19:16.856
If that were me, I'd start
a community-based bank
and invest in areas...

01:19:16.926 --> 01:19:18.836
that these larger banks abandon.

01:19:18.911 --> 01:19:22.206
Abandon for good reason.
That's why the poor get poorer.

01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:25.782
- Who taught you that? Your father?
- Where's your father tonight?

01:19:25.853 --> 01:19:28.273
I'm about to kick your little ass.
That's where he's at.

01:19:28.349 --> 01:19:30.682
Gentlemen, please.
Let's keep it civil.

01:19:30.747 --> 01:19:33.114
We've got two excellent answers.
Looks like we have a tie here.

01:19:33.179 --> 01:19:35.066
- Mm-hmm.
- Professor Engel?

01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:37.978
All right, gentlemen.
This last question is not a simple one,

01:19:38.044 --> 01:19:41.339
so I suggest that you choose
your answers very carefully.

01:19:41.403 --> 01:19:46.551
Now, looking at this chart, what should
the Federal Reserve choose to do?

01:19:46.618 --> 01:19:50.130
If I were, say,
vice chairman of the Federal Reserve,

01:19:50.201 --> 01:19:52.177
I'd raise rates.

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.224
Excellent.

01:19:54.298 --> 01:19:56.468
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

01:19:56.537 --> 01:19:59.385
Hmm? "Why"?

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:04.885
[Clicks Tongue] Because...
That's a good question.

01:20:04.952 --> 01:20:06.991
- [Gasps]
- [Scott] l...

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:10.357
Uh, I have to say that I...

01:20:10.422 --> 01:20:12.310
don't know the answer.

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:14.381
[Audience Murmuring]

01:20:14.454 --> 01:20:18.032
Mr. Witherspoon?
Mr. Witherspoon?

01:20:19.222 --> 01:20:21.589
Yo! [Chuckles]

01:20:21.655 --> 01:20:24.306
Oh. Why raise the rates?

01:20:24.375 --> 01:20:28.497
Well... because of this chart
reflecting Simon's theory.

01:20:28.566 --> 01:20:31.412
John Simon, born in 1908
in Westbridge, Indiana,

01:20:31.478 --> 01:20:34.640
predicts the future of inflation
with the formula:

01:20:34.708 --> 01:20:38.023
I = delta MP
over the square of T.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.685
Thus, requiring
federal correction...

01:20:40.755 --> 01:20:45.326
as evidenced by the board
in 1958, '67 and 1984.

01:20:46.963 --> 01:20:49.232
- [Audience Murmuring]
- [Whispering]

01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:55.346
- [Murmuring Stops]
- [Chuckling]

01:20:55.409 --> 01:20:57.962
Darryl, you've got the job.

01:20:58.033 --> 01:21:00.683
[Cheering]

01:21:00.753 --> 01:21:03.088
Wow!

01:21:03.153 --> 01:21:05.422
Thank you.

01:21:05.489 --> 01:21:08.620
Ebonically speaking,
I know my shit.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.127
- [Applause Continues]
- Thank you!

01:21:13.199 --> 01:21:15.305
- [Laughing]
- [Tim Grunts]

01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:29.993
Wait. Hold up, people, please.
I have something to say.

01:21:32.013 --> 01:21:34.402
- I cheated.
- [All Gasping, Murmuring]

01:21:36.172 --> 01:21:40.101
No, not today. I studied very hard
for this test today.

01:21:41.708 --> 01:21:44.807
But I had an extra edge
in becoming a finalist.

01:21:44.876 --> 01:21:48.136
Not my athletic talent
and not money.

01:21:49.261 --> 01:21:52.161
And it wasn't my daddy.

01:21:52.235 --> 01:21:54.341
- It was an experimental drug.
- Oh!

01:21:54.412 --> 01:21:57.410
- [Audience Murmuring]
- But it wasn't heroin!

01:21:57.483 --> 01:22:01.279
- He's not on the horse.
- Tim, shut up.

01:22:01.354 --> 01:22:03.906
Sorry, but he's not using.

01:22:05.706 --> 01:22:08.487
[Whispers]
It's all right.

01:22:10.218 --> 01:22:12.323
Mr. Tyson, Mr. Bellweather,

01:22:12.393 --> 01:22:14.848
I'm sorry.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.735
I was just willing to do anything
to become a Smythe-Bates man,

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.450
even the wrong thing.

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:23.836
I want you to know
I do deserve the job,

01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:27.207
even though I
didn't earn it honestly.

01:22:29.064 --> 01:22:33.319
And that's the whole story.
Look, I'm sorry if I let you guys down.

01:22:33.383 --> 01:22:36.611
You can't cut me off!
I'm your son! You love me!

01:22:36.678 --> 01:22:39.011
Remember that time
you almost said it?

01:22:39.076 --> 01:22:42.851
Well, folks, the board
has come to a decision.

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:46.778
There will be no junior analyst position
awarded this year.

01:22:46.853 --> 01:22:50.114
But you still proved yourself
the most impressive candidate.

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.482
Come on, kids.

01:22:52.548 --> 01:22:56.160
Darryl, do you think that I was
a junior analyst right out of Stratford?

01:22:56.228 --> 01:22:58.235
[Scoffs] Yeah.

01:22:58.308 --> 01:23:01.602
- Darryl, Daddy started in the mail room.
- Get outta here!

01:23:01.667 --> 01:23:05.114
I tried to be the junior analyst, but...
I didn't come from money.

01:23:05.187 --> 01:23:08.001
I didn't play sports, so...
Sound familiar?

01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:11.066
So what are you saying? That you wasn't
a Smythe-Bates man either?

01:23:11.137 --> 01:23:13.854
But I am, because I know
my job and I work hard.

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:16.735
Do you know who
that reminds me of?

01:23:18.145 --> 01:23:20.381
- Me.
- That's right.

01:23:20.448 --> 01:23:23.350
You are a Smythe-Bates man too,

01:23:23.425 --> 01:23:26.108
so you're going to have
a second chance.

01:23:26.176 --> 01:23:29.045
At the point of graduation,
you'll be given a job in the mail room.

01:23:29.119 --> 01:23:31.454
Doesn't sound like much,
but if you work hard,

01:23:31.519 --> 01:23:33.852
in a year you'll make
a fine junior analyst.

01:23:35.775 --> 01:23:38.109
Maybe a great son-in-law too?

01:23:38.174 --> 01:23:40.028
[Janice, Tyson Together]
Don't push it.

01:23:40.093 --> 01:23:41.850
- Heh-heh!
- Cool.

01:23:41.918 --> 01:23:44.405
[Siren Wailing]

01:23:49.598 --> 01:23:52.858
[Laughter]

01:23:52.925 --> 01:23:56.852
Everybody, a toast to my baby Darryl.

01:23:56.924 --> 01:23:59.771
Thank you for everything
that you've done for us.

01:23:59.836 --> 01:24:02.137
And good luck tomorrow...

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:05.368
on your first day as a junior analyst
at Smythe-Bates.

01:24:05.435 --> 01:24:07.344
- [Guests Congratulating]
- Darius!

01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:11.379
Touch that champagne bottle
