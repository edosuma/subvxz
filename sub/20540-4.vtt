[cheers and applause]

00:41.567 --> 00:44.767
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:44.767 --> 00:45.633
I'm John Oliver.

00:45.633 --> 00:47.667
Thank you so much
for joining us,

00:47.667 --> 00:50.200
and we begin this evening
with President Trump,

00:50.200 --> 00:53.567
two words that still
simply do not belong together,

00:53.567 --> 00:55.333
like "baby pubes"

00:55.333 --> 00:58.500
or "haunted horse."

00:58.500 --> 01:00.867
This week actually began
promisingly for the president,

01:00.867 --> 01:02.967
as he addressed Congress
with what appeared to be

01:02.967 --> 01:04.967
a more disciplined tone.

01:04.967 --> 01:08.467
- The time for small thinking
is over.

01:08.467 --> 01:12.433
The time for trivial fights
is behind us.

01:12.433 --> 01:15.700
- Okay, here's--
here's the thing about that.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.934
I know that's supposed to be
a reassuring statement,

01:17.934 --> 01:19.800
but it could actually go
either way.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.834
"The time for trivial fights
is behind us.

01:21.834 --> 01:24.166
"The time for major fights
is here,

01:24.166 --> 01:25.100
"which is why I'm launching

01:25.100 --> 01:27.600
"a full-scale invasion
of Australia.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.600
Who's with me?"

01:29.600 --> 01:32.066
The speech actually got
rave reviews,

01:32.066 --> 01:34.033
and for almost 24 hours,

01:34.033 --> 01:36.734
it seemed the White House might
finally be getting on track,

01:36.734 --> 01:38.967
until this happened.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.767
- The "Washington Post"
now reporting tonight

01:40.767 --> 01:43.100
that Attorney General
Jeff Sessions,

01:43.100 --> 01:44.767
when he was still a senator

01:44.767 --> 01:46.734
and an adviser
to the Trump campaign,

01:46.734 --> 01:49.934
had meetings with Russia's
ambassador to the U.S.

01:49.934 --> 01:53.567
but did not disclose them during
his confirmation hearings.

01:53.567 --> 01:56.033
- Yes, Jeff Sessions,
Trump's attorney general

01:56.033 --> 01:58.233
and the unfortunate result
of Dobby the house-elf's

01:58.233 --> 02:00.700
one-night stand
with a Confederate flag,

02:00.700 --> 02:03.333
got in trouble this--
enjoy--

02:03.333 --> 02:04.867
got in trouble this week

02:04.867 --> 02:07.734
for undisclosed meetings
with Russia's ambassador,

02:07.734 --> 02:10.533
something which, in itself,
is not against the law.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.233
The problem is,
Sessions's confirmation hearing

02:13.233 --> 02:15.533
featured this exchange.

02:15.533 --> 02:18.266
- If there is any evidence
that anyone

02:18.266 --> 02:21.133
affiliated
with the Trump campaign

02:21.133 --> 02:23.633
communicated
with the Russian government

02:23.633 --> 02:25.100
in the course of this campaign,

02:25.100 --> 02:28.066
what will you do?

02:28.066 --> 02:32.767
- Senator Franken, I'm not aware
of, um, any of those activities.

02:32.767 --> 02:35.033
I have been called a surrogate

02:35.033 --> 02:37.000
at a time or two
in that campaign,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.133
and I didn't have--
not have communications

02:39.133 --> 02:40.934
with the Russians, um,

02:40.934 --> 02:42.934
and I'm unable to comment on it.

02:42.934 --> 02:44.800
- Now, there is an obvious
problem there.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.266
As we now know,
what he just said is not true,

02:47.266 --> 02:50.300
but perhaps the weirder thing
is that was an unforced error.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.533
He wasn't even asked whether
he'd met with the Russians.

02:53.533 --> 02:55.900
He just implicated himself
out of the blue,

02:55.900 --> 02:58.667
which should've been
immediately suspicious.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.667
If you asked someone
how their weekend was,

03:00.667 --> 03:02.867
and they say, "Well,
I definitely wasn't masturbating

03:02.867 --> 03:05.266
into the Slurpee machine
at the 7-Eleven,"

03:05.266 --> 03:09.200
you check the fucking security
cameras at the 7-Eleven,

03:09.200 --> 03:11.633
and you don't act surprised.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.367
And--and you can sort of tell

03:13.367 --> 03:15.066
that Sessions knew
he'd fucked up,

03:15.066 --> 03:18.333
because watch his expression
immediately afterward.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.266
- I didn't have--
not have communications

03:20.266 --> 03:22.066
with the Russians, um,

03:22.066 --> 03:25.000
and I'm unable to comment on it.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.300
- Very well.

03:26.300 --> 03:30.567
Um, without divulging--

03:30.567 --> 03:32.200
[laughter]

03:32.200 --> 03:34.900
- He looked right at the camera!

03:34.900 --> 03:36.867
He looks like he's about
to loosen his collar

03:36.867 --> 03:40.133
and audibly say the word "gulp."

03:40.133 --> 03:43.100
Now, Sessions eventually recused
himself from investigating

03:43.100 --> 03:45.133
anything to do with Russia
and the Trump campaign,

03:45.133 --> 03:46.734
but that might not be enough.

03:46.734 --> 03:48.867
There are now multiple calls
for his resignation,

03:48.867 --> 03:52.367
the most forceful of which
was a damning tweet that read,

03:52.367 --> 03:55.266
"That's not good enough,
you need to resign,"

03:55.266 --> 03:58.066
posted by the band Smash Mouth.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.500
And--
you know what they say,

04:00.500 --> 04:04.767
"As goes Smash Mouth, so goes
about 8,000 people, tops."

04:04.767 --> 04:07.333
And--and to be clear,
to be clear,

04:07.333 --> 04:08.533
it wasn't just Sessions

04:08.533 --> 04:10.333
meeting with Russian officials
last year.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.800
Many Trump campaign operatives,

04:11.800 --> 04:14.166
including J. D. Gordon
and Carter Page,

04:14.166 --> 04:16.367
met with the Russian ambassador,
Sergey Kislyak,

04:16.367 --> 04:17.567
as did Jared Kushner,

04:17.567 --> 04:20.266
and again, there is nothing
inherently wrong there,

04:20.266 --> 04:21.400
but it doesn't look great

04:21.400 --> 04:23.033
that every time Trump associates

04:23.033 --> 04:25.100
are asked about Russia,
they respond

04:25.100 --> 04:26.834
like they're trying
to hide something.

04:26.834 --> 04:30.700
Just watch former policy advisor
Carter Page on Thursday.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.066
- Did you meet Sergey Kislyak
in Cleveland?

04:33.066 --> 04:34.967
Did you talk to him?

04:34.967 --> 04:37.667
- I'm not gonna deny
that I talked with him--

04:37.667 --> 04:38.800
- So you did talk to him?

04:38.800 --> 04:42.433
- I will say that
I never met him anywhere,

04:42.433 --> 04:43.700
uh, outside of Cleveland.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.000
Let's just say that much.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.266
- So the only time that
you met him was in Cleveland?

04:47.266 --> 04:49.633
- I-I--what--
that I may have met him,

04:49.633 --> 04:52.333
possibly, would've--
might have been in Cleveland.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.500
- "I mean,
when you think about it,

04:54.500 --> 04:56.433
"Cleveland is more
a state of mind

04:56.433 --> 04:57.900
"than a physical place, right?

04:57.900 --> 05:00.500
"For example, sometimes,
when I need to delay an orgasm,

05:00.500 --> 05:03.000
"I 'go to Cleveland' in my mind,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.433
"and sometimes,
I meet Sergey Kislyak there.

05:05.433 --> 05:07.400
"Does that count?
Does that count?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.433
Am I still talking?"

05:09.433 --> 05:11.867
And that is part of a pattern
of suspicious responses

05:11.867 --> 05:13.033
you can trace back
to last summer,

05:13.033 --> 05:16.133
when Paul Manafort,
Trump's then-campaign manager,

05:16.133 --> 05:17.633
did this.

05:17.633 --> 05:21.000
- So to be clear, Mr. Trump has
no financial relationships

05:21.000 --> 05:22.667
with any Russian oligarchs?

05:22.667 --> 05:23.900
- That's what he said.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.367
I didn't--that's what I--

05:25.367 --> 05:28.133
that's obviously what
the proposition is.

05:28.133 --> 05:30.133
- Holy shit!

05:30.133 --> 05:31.600
That was so unconvincing,

05:31.600 --> 05:34.233
it probably set off
an unplugged polygraph machine

05:34.233 --> 05:36.500
just sitting
in a closet somewhere.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.100
"I don't know what happened,
Sarge.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.400
"I went in
to get some paper clips,

05:39.400 --> 05:42.233
and the needle
was just going crazy!"

05:42.233 --> 05:43.900
And look, it is not clear

05:43.900 --> 05:45.467
what is really
going on here yet,

05:45.467 --> 05:47.800
although one possibility
is that this all amounts

05:47.800 --> 05:50.934
to what I'm going to call
Stupid Watergate:

05:50.934 --> 05:53.834
a potential scandal with
all the intrigue of Watergate,

05:53.834 --> 05:57.533
except everyone involved
is really bad at everything.

05:57.533 --> 06:00.200
And--and the relevant question
isn't so much,

06:00.200 --> 06:02.367
"What did the president know,
and when did he know it,"

06:02.367 --> 06:05.000
as it is, "Is the president
physically capable

06:05.000 --> 06:07.166
of knowing things at all?"

06:07.166 --> 06:10.033
Because yesterday, he decided
that this was the best way

06:10.033 --> 06:12.467
to dispel everyone's suspicions.

06:12.467 --> 06:14.900
- It was just before sunrise
in Palm Beach

06:14.900 --> 06:16.967
when the President
of the United States

06:16.967 --> 06:18.200
took to Twitter to make

06:18.200 --> 06:20.834
one of his most stunning
accusations ever.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.133
"Terrible!
Just found out

06:22.133 --> 06:24.200
"that Obama had
my 'wires tapped'

06:24.200 --> 06:27.633
in Trump Tower just before
the victory. Nothing found."

06:27.633 --> 06:30.367
Followed by four more
presidential outbursts

06:30.367 --> 06:33.967
taking on President Obama
and misspelling "tap."

06:33.967 --> 06:36.033
[laughter and applause]

06:36.033 --> 06:37.633
- Okay.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.367
Let me give you some context
for where we are.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.266
In 1992,
Dan Quayle misspelled "potato,"

06:43.266 --> 06:45.367
and it became one of
the most famous dumb moments

06:45.367 --> 06:46.800
in political history,

06:46.800 --> 06:49.300
but we are now at a point
where the president is so busy

06:49.300 --> 06:51.767
hurling destabilizing
conspiracy theories around,

06:51.767 --> 06:53.934
we can't even pause
to enjoy the fact

06:53.934 --> 06:57.000
he misspelled the word "tap."

06:57.000 --> 06:58.367
And his evidence for suggesting

06:58.367 --> 07:00.100
President Obama has
committed a crime

07:00.100 --> 07:02.300
seems pretty thin.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.500
- Because the president
cited no proof,

07:04.500 --> 07:06.000
it is not clear tonight

07:06.000 --> 07:07.533
whether he based
his allegations

07:07.533 --> 07:09.734
on a top-secret
White House briefing

07:09.734 --> 07:11.700
or whether it came
from reading an article

07:11.700 --> 07:14.233
on the conservative
"Breitbart" website,

07:14.233 --> 07:16.767
posted Friday,
the detailed speculation

07:16.767 --> 07:18.967
from a conspiracy-loving
talk show host,

07:18.967 --> 07:20.066
Mark Levin.

07:20.066 --> 07:22.367
- Okay, I think
we can now officially declare

07:22.367 --> 07:24.100
that Trump has
a worse media diet

07:24.100 --> 07:25.834
than the Son of Sam killer,

07:25.834 --> 07:27.300
and he got all his news

07:27.300 --> 07:30.800
from a talking dog
who told him to murder.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.500
And rather than
providing evidence

07:32.500 --> 07:33.700
to support the accusation,

07:33.700 --> 07:36.000
this morning,
the White House urged Congress

07:36.000 --> 07:38.967
to look into the allegations,
and it seems odd

07:38.967 --> 07:41.867
that a president would issue
a firm statement of fact

07:41.867 --> 07:45.400
and then launch an investigation
to try and support that claim,

07:45.400 --> 07:47.867
something that was pointed out
to a White House spokesperson

07:47.867 --> 07:49.400
just this morning.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.734
- The President
of the United States

07:51.734 --> 07:56.133
is accusing the former president
of wiretapping him.

07:56.133 --> 07:58.200
- I think that this is, again,
something that--

07:58.200 --> 08:00.166
if this happened, Martha--

08:00.166 --> 08:01.834
- If, if, if, if!

08:01.834 --> 08:04.033
- [laughs]
I agree that--

08:04.033 --> 08:06.567
- Why is the president saying
it did happen?

08:06.567 --> 08:09.300
- Look, I think he is going off
of information that he's saying,

08:09.300 --> 08:10.867
that has led him to believe,

08:10.867 --> 08:13.300
uh, that this is
a very real potential.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.600
[laughter]

08:14.600 --> 08:16.533
- Let's break that down.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.934
She "thinks"
the President saw information

08:18.934 --> 08:23.000
that led him to "believe"
that this is a real "potential."

08:23.000 --> 08:26.333
So I guess this is just how
things are going to work now.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.734
The president once saw
a banana with a bruise

08:28.734 --> 08:29.633
that looked like a picture

08:29.633 --> 08:31.800
in an article he read
in a dream,

08:31.800 --> 08:35.533
and that is why
we're at fucking war!

08:35.533 --> 08:37.867
And the sad thing is...
[cheers and applause]

08:37.867 --> 08:40.266
Deep down, we probably all knew

08:40.266 --> 08:42.266
that this week would end
this way,

08:42.266 --> 08:43.500
and if you need proof of that,

08:43.500 --> 08:45.033
just look at Paul Ryan's face

08:45.033 --> 08:46.934
immediately after
Trump made his call

08:46.934 --> 08:49.734
for an end to triviality
on Tuesday.

08:49.734 --> 08:54.100
- The time for trivial fights
is behind us.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.700
We just need the courage

08:55.700 --> 08:58.667
to share the dreams
that fill our hearts.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.400
[laughter and applause]

09:00.400 --> 09:03.300
- That is the face of a man
thinking,

09:03.300 --> 09:05.867
"Don't laugh.
He's the President."

09:05.867 --> 09:07.100
Which incidentally should now be

09:07.100 --> 09:10.600
the official slogan
of the Republican party.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.734
And now this.

09:19.066 --> 09:21.266
- All right,
my fellow pop culture nerds.

09:21.266 --> 09:23.800
All right, you Apple nerds,
myself included.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.900
Here's how big of a nerd I am.
We political nerds--

09:25.900 --> 09:27.600
All of us political nerds...
I was a huge nerd

09:27.600 --> 09:29.633
and sat and watched
the entire last debate.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.867
Gonna put on my news nerd hat.

09:31.867 --> 09:32.934
Big old news nerd.

09:32.934 --> 09:34.734
I'm a bit of a word nerd.

09:34.734 --> 09:35.900
I was a big "Lost" nerd.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.133
I was a bit of
a Shakespeare nerd.

09:37.133 --> 09:38.200
Big music nerd.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.467
I wanted to have
a geek-out moment with you.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.367
I'm officially
an archeology geek.

09:41.367 --> 09:44.000
I'm a little bit of
a self-professed geek myself.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.100
Thank you for allowing me

09:45.100 --> 09:48.133
to get my Supreme Court geek on
with you.

09:48.133 --> 09:49.900
As a huge space geek...

09:49.900 --> 09:51.166
Listen,
you know I'm a space geek.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.433
All right,
my fellow space geeks.

09:52.433 --> 09:53.967
All right, my fellow
space geeks, check it.

09:53.967 --> 09:55.300
All right,
my fellow space nerds.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.400
Thank you, my fellow space nerd.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.467
- You know I'm a bit of a nerd

09:57.467 --> 09:58.834
about these things--
- I'm a nerd!

09:58.834 --> 10:00.600
Are you geeking out
like I'm geeking out here?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.400
- Oh, my God, come on!
- Is this not amazing?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.800
Thank you very much for having
a nerd moment with me here,

10:04.800 --> 10:05.934
live on CNN.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.100
- Moving on.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.867
For our main story tonight,

10:10.867 --> 10:12.200
we'd like to talk about someone

10:12.200 --> 10:14.000
you may not have thought about
for a while:

10:14.000 --> 10:16.333
the Dalai Lama,
a man so enlightened,

10:16.333 --> 10:19.734
he's basically
the original woke bae.

10:19.734 --> 10:21.166
According to a Gallup poll,

10:21.166 --> 10:22.133
the Dalai Lama is actually

10:22.133 --> 10:24.533
the sixth-most admired man
in America,

10:24.533 --> 10:26.567
and when you mention his name
to people in the street,

10:26.567 --> 10:29.300
you can see
how widely he's revered.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.867
- Lot of respect,
inspiration from what he says.

10:31.867 --> 10:34.700
- He says, like,
a lot of good quotes.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.667
- He has some really great
quotes about life.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.500
- He's said
a lot of good things.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.133
- I guess he's a peaceful man.

10:40.133 --> 10:41.533
- He's about peace.

10:41.533 --> 10:42.967
- Okay, so he's peaceful,

10:42.967 --> 10:45.066
admired,
and has some good quotes.

10:45.066 --> 10:46.600
That is pretty broad.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.667
They could be describing

10:47.667 --> 10:48.867
either the Dalai Lama

10:48.867 --> 10:50.467
or Matthew McConaughey,

10:50.467 --> 10:53.533
but watch what happens
when those same people are asked

10:53.533 --> 10:55.266
a simple follow-up.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.166
- Oh.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.800
- I have no idea.
I'm not even gonna lie.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.500
- I don't know.
He just...

11:04.500 --> 11:06.033
I don't--
I'm not really sure.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.166
- He's a very important figure

11:08.166 --> 11:12.734
for, um, Hinduism?

11:12.734 --> 11:14.400
- That's like,
Buddhist God, right? No?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.834
- No, not a god.
He's a real person.

11:15.834 --> 11:19.000
He's alive.
- Oh, shit.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.400
- He just said "oh, shit"

11:20.400 --> 11:22.600
like he owes the Dalai Lama
money.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.900
"He's alive?
Oh, shit.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.333
"I've got to disappear
for a while.

11:25.333 --> 11:28.567
That guy does not
fuck around."

11:28.567 --> 11:30.166
Now, the Chinese government,
however,

11:30.166 --> 11:31.266
have a very different view,

11:31.266 --> 11:33.734
'cause instead of vaguely loving
the Dalai Lama,

11:33.734 --> 11:36.033
they very specifically hate him.

11:36.033 --> 11:39.233
They've referred to him
as a "wolf in monk's robes"

11:39.233 --> 11:41.066
and have banned his image.

11:41.066 --> 11:43.100
They've even retaliated
against Americans

11:43.100 --> 11:44.834
for even meeting with him.

11:44.834 --> 11:45.934
- Britain's "Guardian" says

11:45.934 --> 11:48.266
China reportedly banned
Lady Gaga.

11:48.266 --> 11:50.000
That's because she met
with the Dalai Lama

11:50.000 --> 11:52.133
in Indianapolis
to discuss yoga.

11:52.133 --> 11:53.367
- Wow.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.867
Not only is it incredible
that they banned her for that;

11:55.867 --> 11:58.567
it's incredible that
that event happened at all.

11:58.567 --> 12:02.633
Lady Gaga was with
the Dalai Lama in Indianapolis

12:02.633 --> 12:04.133
discussing yoga.

12:04.133 --> 12:06.467
That is
only slightly less ridiculous

12:06.467 --> 12:09.000
than Elton John meeting
Ben Bernanke on Easter Island

12:09.000 --> 12:11.233
to talk about Roombas.

12:11.233 --> 12:13.100
Now--now,
the Chinese government's hatred

12:13.100 --> 12:15.000
of the Dalai Lama
stems from its desire

12:15.000 --> 12:16.934
to main control of Tibet,

12:16.934 --> 12:18.633
a region in southwest China,

12:18.633 --> 12:20.433
and Tibet was something
of a celebrity cause

12:20.433 --> 12:22.033
in the 1990s.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.533
There were
Tibetan Freedom Concerts

12:23.533 --> 12:25.734
featuring the Beastie Boys,
and Richard Gere

12:25.734 --> 12:28.066
even brought it up
at the Oscars.

12:28.066 --> 12:29.533
- I was wondering
if this kind of...

12:29.533 --> 12:32.033
[scattered applause]

12:32.033 --> 12:34.700
If something miraculous,
really kind of movie-like

12:34.700 --> 12:36.500
could happen here,

12:36.500 --> 12:41.166
where we could all kind of send
love and--and truth

12:41.166 --> 12:42.467
and a kind of sanity

12:42.467 --> 12:46.100
to Deng Xiaoping
right now in Beijing

12:46.100 --> 12:47.233
that he will take his troops

12:47.233 --> 12:49.233
and take the Chinese away
from Tibet

12:49.233 --> 12:50.734
and allow these people to live

12:50.734 --> 12:52.834
as free independent people
again.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.900
[applause]

12:56.734 --> 12:58.767
So.

12:58.767 --> 13:00.734
Thoughts.
We send these thoughts.

13:00.734 --> 13:03.567
Send this thought out.
Send this thought.

13:03.567 --> 13:05.200
- "We send this thought.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.200
"We send it out right now--
oh, you know what?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.000
"I'm sorry.
There's been a mistake.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.800
"The thoughts are actually
supposed to be sent

13:10.800 --> 13:12.467
"to the producers
of 'Moonlight.'

13:12.467 --> 13:13.500
"Uh, this is not a joke.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.133
"'Moonlight,'
these thoughts are for you.

13:16.133 --> 13:19.033
"There's been
a horrible mistake.

13:19.033 --> 13:22.133
'Moonlight,' take the thoughts."

13:22.133 --> 13:24.667
But--
but there is a lot about Tibet

13:24.667 --> 13:26.033
that you might not
actually know.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.567
For a start, it's larger
than you probably think.

13:28.567 --> 13:31.934
China say it's this area,
but Tibetan exiles will say

13:31.934 --> 13:34.066
it's even larger,
encompassing an area

13:34.066 --> 13:36.233
that is roughly 1/4 of China,

13:36.233 --> 13:38.900
so it's very big
in a confusing way,

13:38.900 --> 13:40.100
which, and this is true,

13:40.100 --> 13:42.166
is also how
director Lars von Trier

13:42.166 --> 13:44.633
characterized
Willem Dafoe's dick.

13:44.633 --> 13:46.834
Seriously, he told reporters,

13:46.834 --> 13:48.066
"It's too big.

13:48.066 --> 13:51.667
Everybody got very confused
when they saw it."

13:51.667 --> 13:52.934
What I'm saying is,

13:52.934 --> 13:55.834
Tibet is the Willem Dafoe's dick
of Planet Earth.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.567
It is surprisingly large.

13:58.567 --> 13:59.667
The point is,

13:59.667 --> 14:02.200
China invaded Tibet in 1950,

14:02.200 --> 14:04.233
and ever since,
they've imposed strict controls

14:04.233 --> 14:06.166
on the institutions
of Tibetan Buddhism there.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.967
Temples and monasteries
have been destroyed,

14:07.967 --> 14:10.800
and hundreds of thousands
of Tibetans have been killed,

14:10.800 --> 14:13.367
and things inside Tibet
are still grim.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.500
When Freedom House scored
countries and territories

14:15.500 --> 14:17.333
for political rights
and civil liberties,

14:17.333 --> 14:19.633
Tibet came in second-worst,

14:19.633 --> 14:21.166
behind Syria

14:21.166 --> 14:24.567
and ahead of both Somalia
and North Korea.

14:24.567 --> 14:28.266
The whole territory is
a gross human rights violation,

14:28.266 --> 14:29.767
which is interestingly
another way

14:29.767 --> 14:31.333
that Lars von Trier
has described

14:31.333 --> 14:33.667
Willem Dafoe's penis.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.734
And perhaps the clearest sign
of just how bad conditions are

14:36.734 --> 14:38.800
is the fact that
since early 2009,

14:38.800 --> 14:43.300
146 Tibetans have self-immolated
in Tibet and China,

14:43.300 --> 14:46.000
setting themselves on fire
in protest,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.600
to which the Chinese police
have been less than sympathetic.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.633
[unintelligible yelling]

15:15.000 --> 15:18.533
- Well, every part of that
is fucking horrifying,

15:18.533 --> 15:21.734
and China is unlikely to loosen
its grip on the region.

15:21.734 --> 15:23.500
Tibet has
incredibly rich resources,

15:23.500 --> 15:24.800
from gold and lithium

15:24.800 --> 15:27.100
to rivers supplying
hydroelectric power and water

15:27.100 --> 15:28.667
to over a billion people,

15:28.667 --> 15:30.433
so they are very sensitive

15:30.433 --> 15:32.600
to any perceived threat
to their control,

15:32.600 --> 15:35.400
which brings us back
to the Dalai Lama.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.000
Traditionally, he's been both
a spiritual and political leader

15:39.000 --> 15:40.467
of Tibetan Buddhists,
sort of a cross

15:40.467 --> 15:44.567
between a pope and a president,
a popesident, if you will,

15:44.567 --> 15:46.934
but you shouldn't,
so please don't.

15:46.934 --> 15:48.667
China has done
everything they can

15:48.667 --> 15:50.200
over the years
to diminish his power.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.834
He even fled Tibet in 1959
under fear of arrest,

15:53.834 --> 15:55.433
and he hasn't been back since,

15:55.433 --> 15:57.600
an escape that was reported
at the time

15:57.600 --> 16:00.734
by the most British man
who has ever lived.

16:00.734 --> 16:02.100
- The young Dalai Lama,

16:02.100 --> 16:04.500
revered by his people
as a living Buddha,

16:04.500 --> 16:06.900
was reported under arrest
by the Reds,

16:06.900 --> 16:08.333
but,
according to other sources,

16:08.333 --> 16:09.834
is safely in hiding.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.166
One clear fact:

16:11.166 --> 16:12.900
Red tyranny is not wanted

16:12.900 --> 16:15.200
by these intensely religious
people.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.367
- "Yes, damn that unwanted
creeping Red tyranny,

16:18.367 --> 16:20.967
"down with those thieving
imperialists,

16:20.967 --> 16:22.867
"and good night
to Her Majesty's subjects

16:22.867 --> 16:25.200
"in Bahrain, Maldives,
Rhodesia, Jamaica,

16:25.200 --> 16:27.800
"Barbados, Kenya, and Uganda.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.266
Nighty night.
Sleepy tight."

16:30.266 --> 16:31.600
[cheers and applause]

16:31.600 --> 16:34.700
And so, for over 50 years,

16:34.700 --> 16:37.166
the Dalai Lama has lived
in exile in India,

16:37.166 --> 16:38.600
and he's lived quite a life.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.734
He's met with
the last four presidents,

16:40.734 --> 16:42.834
and when he was a child,
FDR gave him

16:42.834 --> 16:45.567
a beautiful
Patek Philippe pocket watch,

16:45.567 --> 16:47.033
which he still has to this day,

16:47.033 --> 16:50.166
and George W. Bush gave him
an even greater gift

16:50.166 --> 16:54.500
by painting his portrait,
this portrait,

16:54.500 --> 16:56.400
and I give Bush's skills
as an artist

16:56.400 --> 16:59.000
the same review I give
his time as president:

16:59.000 --> 17:01.166
not bad for a five-year-old.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.734
Now, the Dalai Lama
officially stepped down

17:03.734 --> 17:05.934
from running
the Tibetan government in exile

17:05.934 --> 17:07.300
in 2011, but he is still

17:07.300 --> 17:09.900
of profound importance
to the Tibetan people

17:09.900 --> 17:12.300
as a spiritual leader
and a figurehead,

17:12.300 --> 17:13.900
and here, here is where

17:13.900 --> 17:16.300
this story gets
absolutely amazing,

17:16.300 --> 17:17.967
because he's 81 years old,

17:17.967 --> 17:19.800
so thoughts
have inevitably turned

17:19.800 --> 17:21.233
to his next reincarnation,

17:21.233 --> 17:24.333
but it turns out there's a bit
of a problem with that.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.300
Let me explain.

17:25.300 --> 17:28.100
Broadly speaking,
when the Dalai Lama dies,

17:28.100 --> 17:29.934
he reincarnates as a child

17:29.934 --> 17:32.033
somewhere on Earth,
and traditionally,

17:32.033 --> 17:34.133
a key person
in the process of finding him

17:34.133 --> 17:36.333
is someone called
the Panchen Lama,

17:36.333 --> 17:37.800
and when the Panchen Lama dies,

17:37.800 --> 17:40.734
the Dalai Lama plays
a similar role in finding him,

17:40.734 --> 17:41.734
and so on, and so on.

17:41.734 --> 17:44.066
They're basically playing
a Buddhist version

17:44.066 --> 17:45.934
of hide-and-seek.

17:45.934 --> 17:49.000
So the ninth Panchen Lama
helped to identify

17:49.000 --> 17:50.734
the current Dalai Lama,

17:50.734 --> 17:53.900
who in turn identified
this six-year-old boy

17:53.900 --> 17:55.133
as the Panchen Lama,

17:55.133 --> 17:57.266
but this is where it starts
to get tricky,

17:57.266 --> 18:01.400
because that boy has not been
seen in more than 20 years.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.834
- These are
the last known pictures

18:02.834 --> 18:04.200
of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima,

18:04.200 --> 18:06.633
the boy chosen
to be Panchen Lama.

18:06.633 --> 18:09.333
The Chinese authorities
rejected his appointment,

18:09.333 --> 18:11.734
arrested the boy
and his family.

18:11.734 --> 18:12.834
- It's true.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.934
China kidnapped a six-year-old,

18:14.934 --> 18:16.934
and no one has
heard from him since,

18:16.934 --> 18:18.333
although just two years ago,

18:18.333 --> 18:21.467
a senior Chinese official said
he is "being educated,

18:21.467 --> 18:23.900
"living a normal life,
growing up healthily,

18:23.900 --> 18:26.033
and does not wish
to be disturbed,"

18:26.033 --> 18:28.066
which is a little suspicious
'cause it sounds like

18:28.066 --> 18:30.533
the kind of thing
a former child star's publicist

18:30.533 --> 18:32.367
would scream into a phone.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.667
"She's growing up healthy,
living a normal life,

18:34.667 --> 18:36.066
"and those track marks
on her arms

18:36.066 --> 18:38.066
"are just where they inject
the vitamins.

18:38.066 --> 18:41.333
She's fine!
She's fine!"

18:41.333 --> 18:44.633
But China didn't stop at
just stealing the Panchen Lama.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.967
They had another trick
up their sleeve.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.400
- In an attempt to discredit
the Dalai Lama's choice

18:49.400 --> 18:51.834
of one of Tibet's
top Buddhist spiritual leaders,

18:51.834 --> 18:55.066
Chinese officials used
a 200-year-old ceremony

18:55.066 --> 18:57.700
to name their own Panchen Lama.

18:57.700 --> 19:01.834
- Yes, they made
their own fake Panchen Lama.

19:01.834 --> 19:04.467
They basically counterfeited
a religious leader

19:04.467 --> 19:06.500
like a knockoff handbag.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.000
That doesn't say "Coach."
That says "Cough."

19:10.000 --> 19:12.533
And--and China's tactics here
are obvious.

19:12.533 --> 19:14.166
If they control
the Panchen Lama,

19:14.166 --> 19:16.533
they can use him
to pick a new Dalai Lama

19:16.533 --> 19:18.734
who might,
completely coincidentally,

19:18.734 --> 19:21.333
be very favorable
to the Chinese government.

19:21.333 --> 19:24.000
Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama,
understandably,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.433
is pretty pissed off about this.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.467
- The one thing
that I want to make clear

19:29.467 --> 19:34.967
as far as my own rebirth
is concerned,

19:34.967 --> 19:38.967
the final authority is myself.

19:38.967 --> 19:41.734
No one else.

19:41.734 --> 19:44.734
And obviously not
Chinese Communists.

19:44.734 --> 19:45.834
- Yeah.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.900
That is some forceful language
too.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.000
He's basically saying,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.834
"They can make that decision
over my dead body,

19:51.834 --> 19:55.367
except, you know,
specifically not that."

19:55.367 --> 19:57.400
He's now actually saying
that he will either not

19:57.400 --> 19:59.600
reincarnate as the Dalai Lama
at all

19:59.600 --> 20:03.133
or, if he does, it won't be
inside Chinese-controlled Tibet,

20:03.133 --> 20:05.333
it will be somewhere else,
which is incredible

20:05.333 --> 20:07.033
because that means
that when he dies,

20:07.033 --> 20:10.667
we could plausibly wind up
with two rival Dalai Lamas,

20:10.667 --> 20:12.934
and the already fraught
situation in Tibet

20:12.934 --> 20:14.600
could spiral out of control.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.066
And for the time being,
there is really only one person

20:17.066 --> 20:19.100
who can fill you in on
what is happening

20:19.100 --> 20:21.900
in the Dalai Lama's head,
but he lives in India,

20:21.900 --> 20:23.967
and that is
a 14-hour flight away,

20:23.967 --> 20:25.233
and the reason I know that

20:25.233 --> 20:28.233
is I went to speak
to the Dalai Lama in India.

20:28.233 --> 20:29.233
Enjoy.

20:29.233 --> 20:30.266
[cheers and applause]

20:30.266 --> 20:31.834
[Indian music]

20:31.834 --> 20:34.166
Yes, I traveled
to the Himalayan foothills

20:34.166 --> 20:36.000
of Dharamsala, India,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.200
a journey
that involved considerably more

20:38.200 --> 20:39.433
uphill walking,

20:39.433 --> 20:41.200
cows, and monkey traffic

20:41.200 --> 20:42.900
than I'd been led to believe,

20:42.900 --> 20:45.633
all to talk with the Dalai Lama
about China,

20:45.633 --> 20:49.166
conditions in Tibet,
and what comes next for him.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.800
Your Holiness,
it is an honor to speak to you.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.066
May I say, tashi delek.

20:54.066 --> 20:55.500
- Tashi delek.
Thank you.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.900
- How is my pronunciation?

20:56.900 --> 20:58.500
Tashi de--
- I think very good.

20:58.500 --> 21:03.066
- In my defense, I just started
learning Tibetan 40 seconds ago.

21:03.066 --> 21:05.066
- [laughs]

21:05.066 --> 21:06.834
- So let's talk about China.
- Mm.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.300
- Because the Chinese government

21:08.300 --> 21:11.100
absolutely hates you,
don't they?

21:11.100 --> 21:12.333
- Yes.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.433
- Publicly,
one government official said

21:14.433 --> 21:17.100
you're a wolf
wrapped in monk's robes.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.200
- Mm.

21:18.200 --> 21:21.266
- And photos of you
are forbidden in many places.

21:21.266 --> 21:24.333
You don't, to me,
look like an evil wolf.

21:24.333 --> 21:27.033
- [laughs]

21:27.033 --> 21:30.000
They describe me as a demon.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.033
- You're a demon?
Yeah.

21:32.033 --> 21:33.767
- Then I immediately reacted,

21:33.767 --> 21:37.900
"Yes, I'm demon with horn."

21:37.900 --> 21:40.033
- Yeah, 'cause that's
the classic demon, right?

21:40.033 --> 21:40.934
- Yes.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.667
- I think that's--
when they look at you,

21:42.667 --> 21:44.266
that's what they see.

21:44.266 --> 21:47.533
- Oh, whatever they want to see,
that's their freedom.

21:47.533 --> 21:49.767
I have no such--
no negative feeling.

21:49.767 --> 21:53.133
I just feel a laugh, like that.

21:53.133 --> 21:58.667
I practice, you see,
taking others' anger, suspicion,

21:58.667 --> 22:03.900
distrust,
and give them patience,

22:03.900 --> 22:06.734
tolerance, and compassion.

22:06.734 --> 22:07.834
I practice that.

22:07.834 --> 22:10.133
- But it seems
the Chinese government

22:10.133 --> 22:13.133
are particularly good
at taking your positivity,

22:13.133 --> 22:16.266
turning it back into negativity

22:16.266 --> 22:19.166
and oppression
of the Tibetan people,

22:19.166 --> 22:21.266
and they hand it back to you
as it was.

22:21.266 --> 22:22.500
- Yes.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.133
- Just outside
the Dalai Lama's temple

22:24.133 --> 22:26.200
is a local memorial
honoring Tibetans

22:26.200 --> 22:27.834
who've self-immolated
in protest

22:27.834 --> 22:29.533
against Chinese oppression,

22:29.533 --> 22:32.500
acts that put him
in a very difficult position.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.533
This is a hard question.
- Oh.

22:34.533 --> 22:37.233
- The self-immolation
that has happened...

22:37.233 --> 22:38.166
- Oh.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.433
- 140 Tibetans...
- Yes.

22:40.433 --> 22:42.467
- Have burned themselves.

22:42.467 --> 22:43.867
It is very, very sad.

22:43.867 --> 22:45.166
- Indeed, yes.

22:45.166 --> 22:48.700
- Why is it hard for you
to definitively tell them

22:48.700 --> 22:51.166
to stop doing it?

22:51.166 --> 22:54.500
- This is, I find, very
difficult sort of situation.

22:54.500 --> 22:58.834
Right from the beginning,
when I first heard that,

22:58.834 --> 23:02.500
firstly, I express
my sort of sadness.

23:02.500 --> 23:08.000
Then, meantime,
if I say their action is wrong,

23:08.000 --> 23:12.400
then their family, they will--
they feel very sad.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.133
One of their family member

23:14.133 --> 23:18.066
did something
against the Dalai Lama's wish.

23:18.066 --> 23:20.600
- Right.
- I don't want to create that.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.300
Then, certainly,
I cannot support that,

23:23.300 --> 23:24.834
the act of killing.

23:24.834 --> 23:29.433
From Buddhist viewpoint,
self-killing, not good.

23:29.433 --> 23:33.166
So therefore, my position
is very, very difficult,

23:33.166 --> 23:36.433
so then best thing is,
remain silent.

23:36.433 --> 23:38.767
Keep quiet.

23:38.767 --> 23:40.900
- The Dalai Lama
is painfully aware

23:40.900 --> 23:42.600
how powerful his words are,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.633
and he occasionally uses them
in targeted

23:44.633 --> 23:47.400
and sometimes
surprisingly specific ways,

23:47.400 --> 23:48.500
like this example,

23:48.500 --> 23:50.600
which he offered up
out of nowhere.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.567
- One of my previous visit,
Mongolia.

23:53.567 --> 23:56.266
They took lot of vodka.

23:56.266 --> 23:58.633
The Russians sort of
hard philosophy.

23:58.633 --> 23:59.867
- They like a drink.

23:59.867 --> 24:01.233
Yeah.
Vodka.

24:01.233 --> 24:05.967
- Then, I said,
"Drink much less vodka."

24:05.967 --> 24:07.633
- Yeah, they love to hear that.

24:07.633 --> 24:09.900
- Instead of that,
their tradition

24:09.900 --> 24:12.066
is to drink horse milk.

24:12.066 --> 24:14.433
- Wait, hold on.
- Horse milk.

24:14.433 --> 24:17.300
- Wait, you tried
to wean them off vodka

24:17.300 --> 24:18.900
by giving them horse milk?

24:18.900 --> 24:21.300
- Oh, yes.
They--they follow.

24:21.300 --> 24:23.633
- What?
- They follow.

24:23.633 --> 24:28.300
Since then, I think
a majority of Mongolian

24:28.300 --> 24:30.166
no longer any drink.

24:30.166 --> 24:32.900
- Hold on, that is a--
that is a huge claim.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.734
You cured Mongolia
of alcoholism...

24:35.734 --> 24:37.834
- Yes.
- Using horse milk?

24:37.834 --> 24:39.734
- Yes.
- Yeah, not to labor the point--

24:39.734 --> 24:43.233
I'm just concerned I would see
horse milk, and I'd think,

24:43.233 --> 24:45.600
"Oh, that came from a horse."

24:45.600 --> 24:48.100
- This--
- Oh, oh.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.133
- That's illogical.

24:49.133 --> 24:52.300
What's differences,
cow milk and horse milk?

24:52.300 --> 24:53.333
What differences?

24:53.333 --> 24:55.433
- One comes out of a cow.

24:55.433 --> 24:58.533
The other, I don't know
how you get it out of a horse.

24:58.533 --> 25:01.600
- [laughs]

25:02.900 --> 25:04.600
- Finally, we were having fun,

25:04.600 --> 25:07.667
and I knew just how
to keep the party going.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.934
Let's talk about
a lighter subject: death.

25:10.934 --> 25:14.567
You are going to die,
and when you do,

25:14.567 --> 25:16.767
it's going to be
a massive problem

25:16.767 --> 25:20.266
because there are issues
regarding your reincarnation

25:20.266 --> 25:22.233
regarding China.

25:22.233 --> 25:24.834
- I do not match concern
about that.

25:24.834 --> 25:28.500
My main concern is well-being
of 7 billion human being

25:28.500 --> 25:34.066
and then preservation
of rich Buddhist tradition,

25:34.066 --> 25:35.500
which we kept.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.367
- But you're intertwined
with that.

25:37.367 --> 25:38.734
- No, no.
As an individual person,

25:38.734 --> 25:40.066
not much important.

25:40.066 --> 25:41.066
You know.

25:41.066 --> 25:43.367
- Right,
but you're the Dalai Lama.

25:43.367 --> 25:47.033
- But Buddhism,
over 2,600 years,

25:47.033 --> 25:48.867
still very much alive.

25:48.867 --> 25:52.233
- So do you think you might be
the last Dalai Lama?

25:52.233 --> 25:53.233
- Very possible.

25:53.233 --> 25:54.767
- You do?
- Yes.

25:54.767 --> 25:56.667
- You might be it?

25:56.667 --> 25:59.834
- If I become last Dalai Lama,
I feel very happy.

25:59.834 --> 26:01.166
- Why,
because you were a good one?

26:01.166 --> 26:05.333
- Oh, yes, I may say,
quite intelligent.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.133
- Oh, oh, you're calling
yourself intelligent, are you?

26:07.133 --> 26:08.533
- Oh, I think so.

26:08.533 --> 26:11.233
- So a little bit of arrogance
there, as well.

26:11.233 --> 26:14.967
But if you don't resolve
your reincarnation issue,

26:14.967 --> 26:18.433
are you not worried
that China will appoint

26:18.433 --> 26:20.233
their own Dalai Lama

26:20.233 --> 26:24.000
and he may not speak
like you're speaking now?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.400
- That also, if, may I say so?
- Yeah.

26:26.400 --> 26:31.133
- That's also, you see,
one of the foolish act.

26:31.133 --> 26:33.133
Short-sighted.
- China.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.867
- Without using
human brain properly.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.133
It's harmful.

26:38.133 --> 26:41.233
- That's--
that is a guaranteed way

26:41.233 --> 26:43.333
to calm
the Chinese government down,

26:43.333 --> 26:46.367
to tell them they're not using
the human brain properly.

26:46.367 --> 26:47.700
- I told them,

26:47.700 --> 26:50.033
our brain usually, you see,

26:50.033 --> 26:53.567
have the ability
to create common sense.

26:53.567 --> 26:57.266
The Chinese hardliners,
in their brain,

26:57.266 --> 26:58.900
that part of brain is missing.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.200
- Zing.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.066
- But you know what I think?

27:03.066 --> 27:06.333
The Chinese leaders,
Chinese Communists,

27:06.333 --> 27:08.934
they are very much concerned
about image of China.

27:08.934 --> 27:11.700
- I'm happy to sit here
and criticize China with you,

27:11.700 --> 27:13.900
because I know
the consequences for me

27:13.900 --> 27:16.333
are not necessarily as bad
as they are for you.

27:16.333 --> 27:19.433
- [laughs]

27:19.433 --> 27:23.533
So, so I wish--
you see, they call me demon,

27:23.533 --> 27:26.033
so I want another demon,

27:26.033 --> 27:27.300
so you become demon.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.934
- No, no, no.
You can't transfer--

27:28.934 --> 27:31.400
you can't reincarnate the demon
into me.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.433
- Oh, yes, yes.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.433
- No, no, no, no.

27:33.433 --> 27:34.567
Don't make me a demon.

27:34.567 --> 27:36.133
- [laughs]
- No, no, no.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.266
You can't do--
we--you cannot do that.

27:38.266 --> 27:39.166
- You know...
- Can he do that?

27:39.166 --> 27:40.600
- As I've been telling you,
you see.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.333
- Oh, no.
- [laughs]

27:43.333 --> 27:45.266
- This is not how I wanted
this interview to go.

27:45.266 --> 27:47.367
So the Dalai Lama
seems determined

27:47.367 --> 27:50.834
to keep his reincarnation plans
private for the time being,

27:50.834 --> 27:53.633
leaving millions of Tibetans
waiting for an answer,

27:53.633 --> 27:55.133
and as our time drew
to a close,

27:55.133 --> 27:57.767
I wanted to cement
our new friendship.

27:57.767 --> 28:00.800
You were given a watch by
President Roosevelt.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.400
Is that true?
- Yes, true.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.734
At that time, I think one...
Patek Philippe.

28:06.734 --> 28:08.734
- Patek Philippe.
A beautiful watch.

28:08.734 --> 28:09.834
- Pocket watch.
- Right.

28:09.834 --> 28:13.066
Well, I have
a special gift for you.

28:13.066 --> 28:16.133
It is not a beautiful watch
from a president,

28:16.133 --> 28:19.233
but it is a special watch
from me.

28:19.233 --> 28:21.066
Here it is.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.967
It's a calculator watch.

28:22.967 --> 28:25.066
- Ah.

28:25.066 --> 28:26.033
- Right?

28:26.033 --> 28:27.033
- Oh.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.900
- Roosevelt may have given you
a fancy watch,

28:28.900 --> 28:31.433
but that is water-resistant.

28:31.433 --> 28:33.066
- Wonderful.
Thank you.

28:33.066 --> 28:36.734
Roosevelt watch,
I think, old-fashioned.

28:36.734 --> 28:38.533
- Yeah.
- Now this new-fashioned.

28:38.533 --> 28:41.400
- Well, not so much
new-fashioned as from the 1980s.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.533
- Thank you.

28:42.533 --> 28:43.600
Thank you.
Thank you much.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:44.700 --> 28:45.834
- My demon friend.

28:45.834 --> 28:48.300
- [laughs]
- It was an honor.

28:48.300 --> 28:50.133
[cheers and applause]

28:50.133 --> 28:51.667
That's our show.
Thanks for watching.

28:51.667 --> 28:53.800
See you next week.
Good night!
