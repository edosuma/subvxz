(serene music playing)

01:04.033 --> 01:05.400
Hi, Blanche.

01:05.467 --> 01:07.133
Hi. How was school today?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.467
Pretty good.

01:08.533 --> 01:12.100
Almost half the class came
back after the fire drill.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.633
"Price tag pinned to right sleeve."

01:16.700 --> 01:17.600
What are you doing?

01:17.667 --> 01:19.300
Saving the tags
from this dress

01:19.367 --> 01:21.567
so I can put them
back on tomorrow.

01:21.633 --> 01:24.500
When I return it,
they won't know I've worn it.

01:26.100 --> 01:29.467
You wear a dress, then return,
Blanche, that's illegal.

01:29.533 --> 01:33.333
Oh, it is not illegal.
It's just wrong.

01:35.166 --> 01:39.400
I love the dress but can't
afford it, not $300 worth.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.767
I have a late date.
I want to look stunning.

01:43.266 --> 01:45.800
I'm not going to
wear it that much,

01:45.867 --> 01:48.467
just put it on and take it off.

01:48.533 --> 01:50.967
Then put it on, come home,
and take it off again.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.834
Dorothy, great news,

01:55.900 --> 01:58.200
Gladys Goldfein's taking me
to see Tony Bennett.

01:58.266 --> 01:59.800
Oh, Sophia, that's terrific.

01:59.867 --> 02:03.100
No kidding. I won't have to spend
that evening with Dorothy.

02:05.266 --> 02:07.033
No offense,
my little Scrabble-holic,

02:07.100 --> 02:10.300
but there's more to life
than a double-word score.

02:10.367 --> 02:13.633
Strange attitude for a woman
who tried to choke me

02:13.700 --> 02:16.166
because I challenged the word
"flot."

02:18.700 --> 02:20.433
Can you believe it?
Tony Bennett.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.467
What he does to me
with his voice

02:22.533 --> 02:24.767
your father couldn't
accomplish with his hands.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.800
I know what you're talking about.

02:29.867 --> 02:32.767
There are men's voices
that get me going too.

02:32.834 --> 02:36.800
Blanche, there are men's socks
that can get you going.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.000
-Hi, everybody.
-Hi.

02:40.066 --> 02:41.934
We remember what today is?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I'll say Thursday,
but you can't go by me.

02:45.066 --> 02:47.066
I'm in and out
on my children's first names.

02:50.667 --> 02:54.734
It's the 117th anniversary
of the birth of Robert Frost.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.000
I love him.
Always nipping at your nose.

02:59.033 --> 03:00.467
That was Jack Frost.

03:00.533 --> 03:04.533
Robert Frost is the guy
who interviewed Nixon on TV.

03:07.266 --> 03:09.200
Who's the dumb one now?

03:12.433 --> 03:15.433
Ah, you're still the reigning champ,
Rose.

03:16.467 --> 03:17.867
That was David Frost.

03:17.934 --> 03:20.767
Robert Frost was
a famous American poet.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.333
When I was with him,
he was always nipping at my nose.

03:25.133 --> 03:28.633
Some found it obnoxious.
For me it was a turn-on.

03:29.133 --> 03:31.800
Miles is cooking dinner
to celebrate Frost's birthday.

03:31.867 --> 03:33.834
He invited us all,
and we accepted.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.900
I don't remember agreeing to that.

03:35.967 --> 03:39.533
Sure you did. I distinctly remember
you said, "Oh, boy!

03:39.600 --> 03:42.500
Miles reading poetry.
Sign me up, sign me up."

03:42.567 --> 03:45.133
You sounded pretty definite.

03:45.200 --> 03:50.033
Sarcasm, Rose, like when I say
you're lucky to be a natural blonde.

03:52.867 --> 03:53.800
Thank you.

03:55.934 --> 03:58.333
Just forget it, Rose.
I have a late date.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.066
You can leave early.
A promise is a promise.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.834
We're all very fond of Miles.

04:03.900 --> 04:06.600
Besides, a little culture
wouldn't hurt us.

04:06.667 --> 04:11.000
All right, we'll go, but I'd rather
stay home and eat flot.

04:13.633 --> 04:17.633
Overall then, what I'd say
Frost is most remembered for

04:17.700 --> 04:21.533
is his simple, clear use of language
and uncomplicated imagery,

04:21.600 --> 04:24.834
to express the quiet values
of a rural new England life.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.200
Are we home yet?

04:30.333 --> 04:35.100
My, oh, my, just look at all
the other places to be.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.533
It is amazing, isn't it?

04:39.600 --> 04:42.033
How with a few
carefully chosen words,

04:42.100 --> 04:44.233
a poet can convey
the immediacy

04:44.300 --> 04:46.033
of a specific life experience.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.400
You don't have to tell me.

04:47.467 --> 04:51.066
I grew up in a small farm town.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.433
Here a quack, there a quack...

04:57.000 --> 04:58.367
everywhere...

04:59.400 --> 05:00.667
a quack-quack.

05:03.266 --> 05:04.900
Look,
there's a black guy doing the news,

05:04.967 --> 05:06.133
and it isn't even the weekend.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.867
Ma, did you turn that on?

05:13.367 --> 05:15.400
Poltergeist.

05:15.900 --> 05:16.934
(man on TV)
<i>Thanks, Steve.</i>

05:17.000 --> 05:19.367
<i>And lord knows,</i>
<i>we can use the rain.</i>

05:19.433 --> 05:20.734
<i>In the news this hour,</i>

05:20.800 --> 05:23.200
<i>one of the FBI's</i>
<i>10 most-wanted criminals,</i>

05:23.266 --> 05:25.767
<i>escaped convict</i>
<i>and underworld kingpin</i>

05:25.834 --> 05:28.867
<i>Mickey "the Cheeseman"</i>
<i>Moran is dead.</i>

05:28.934 --> 05:30.667
Ma, turn it off.

05:30.734 --> 05:31.934
Now.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.133
No. Let's just
hear that to the end.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.233
<i>He was blown up this morning</i>

05:36.300 --> 05:38.266
<i>outside his home</i>
<i>in Suburban Chicago</i>

05:38.333 --> 05:41.033
<i>by a bomb attached</i>
<i>to his car's ignition,</i>

05:41.100 --> 05:44.033
<i>a violent end for a violent man.</i>

05:44.533 --> 05:46.767
You know, ladies,
what do you say

05:46.834 --> 05:48.767
we take a rain check
on the poetry reading?

05:48.834 --> 05:51.867
No dice. Doesn't a rain check mean
we have to come back?

05:54.834 --> 05:59.633
When she kids you like that,
it means she likes you.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.900
Well, I do have
some papers to grade,

06:02.967 --> 06:05.500
and I could use the time.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.333
Here are the poems
I was going to read.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.500
Why don't you look them over,

06:08.567 --> 06:11.133
and we'll discuss them next time
we're together, hmm?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.934
-So long.
-Bye, Blanche.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.166
Actually,
I was describing the evening.

06:21.233 --> 06:22.133
Yeah, Burnett?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.433
Miles Weber.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.800
I just heard about the cheese-man
on TV.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.734
Can it be?
Am I free?

06:29.500 --> 06:32.100
(telephone rings)

06:33.900 --> 06:34.767
Hello.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.967
Oh, Gladys Bubbie.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.967
You what?

06:39.033 --> 06:42.033
Goldfein,
I put a Sicilian curse on you.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.600
You'll be barren.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.500
Ok. Worse,
you won't be barren.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.233
And you know what else,
Goldfein?

06:50.300 --> 06:51.967
That sandwich
I gave you yesterday?

06:52.033 --> 06:53.233
It was ham!

06:55.433 --> 06:57.000
Ma, what is it?

06:57.066 --> 06:59.867
Gladys wants to take a man
to Tony Bennett in my place.

06:59.934 --> 07:03.700
Sophia, it's all right
to drop your girlfriend

07:03.767 --> 07:05.500
because a man asks you out.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.233
That's the law of the jungle.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.166
Thank you, Sheena,
queen of the slut people.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.834
Ma, Gladys is your best friend.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.266
She didn't do this
to hurt your feelings.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.800
It was probably an accident.

07:20.867 --> 07:23.734
She must have forgotten
she already invited you.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.333
Listen, pussycat,
there are no accidents.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.000
Nobody wrongs someone
without meaning it.

07:28.066 --> 07:31.800
-That's ridiculous.
-Aah! Aah!

07:32.900 --> 07:34.100
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.700
I was going to
take this dress back.

07:36.767 --> 07:39.567
-You're sorry?
-It was an accident.

07:39.633 --> 07:40.967
Or was it?

07:45.367 --> 07:49.266
I'll tell you one thing,
you're paying for this dress.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.533
I am not paying for the dress.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.367
I will pay
for the dry cleaning only.

07:56.433 --> 08:00.500
You can't return something
after it's been worn.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.300
I can't now,
after your little spasm.

08:05.667 --> 08:09.000
I wanted to wear something tonight
that Duane's never seen me in.

08:09.066 --> 08:10.667
Maybe you should try underwear.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.200
(doorbell chimes)

08:19.367 --> 08:21.367
Miles, I thought
you were grading papers.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.200
No. I wasn't.

08:23.266 --> 08:24.300
I lied.

08:24.367 --> 08:26.734
My God, what were you grading?

08:28.133 --> 08:32.066
Rose, Rose,
I have wonderful news.

08:32.133 --> 08:35.233
But I think you better sit down
before you hear it.

08:35.300 --> 08:36.967
Ok. You're the professor.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.333
Well, you see, I'm not.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.100
I'm not really a professor.

08:41.166 --> 08:42.033
What?

08:42.100 --> 08:44.433
My name's not really
Miles Weber.

08:44.500 --> 08:48.033
Well, then... what are you
talking about, Miles?

08:48.100 --> 08:50.633
Rose, my real name
is Nicholas Carbone.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.500
I was an accountant in Chicago,

08:52.567 --> 08:54.667
and my biggest client
was the dead man

08:54.734 --> 08:56.533
we saw on the news tonight.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.700
-The cheese-man?
-That's right.

08:59.767 --> 09:02.233
But Rose, believe me,
by the time I found out,

09:02.300 --> 09:04.367
I was too deeply involved.

09:04.433 --> 09:05.300
I was arrested.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.233
The Feds tried to pin
everything on me.

09:07.300 --> 09:11.100
Did they,
have you been to prison?

09:11.166 --> 09:14.200
No. I couldn't let that happen.

09:14.266 --> 09:16.400
Imagine what my life
would have been like

09:16.467 --> 09:19.467
if the other inmates found out
how much I love to dance.

09:23.533 --> 09:28.033
No. The D.A. offered me a deal,
and I turned state's evidence,

09:28.100 --> 09:31.800
which put my client Mr. Moran
away for a long time.

09:31.867 --> 09:33.400
Do you understand?

09:33.467 --> 09:35.000
Yeah. You're a snitch.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.800
I'm not a snitch.
I'm an informant.

09:38.867 --> 09:40.333
Oh, a snitch in a tie.

09:41.734 --> 09:45.333
It would have all been behind me,
but he escaped.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.834
The government put me in
the witness protection program.

09:47.900 --> 09:52.567
-Gave me a whole new identity.
-I don't know what to say.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.700
I can't believe this story.

09:54.767 --> 09:57.734
But you can believe the story
about Henrik Felderstuhl,

09:57.800 --> 10:00.633
St. Olaf's half-man,
half-grasshopper?

10:04.333 --> 10:06.633
Dorothy, I'm telling you, when
he rubbed his legs together,

10:06.700 --> 10:09.633
you'd swear you were
on a camping trip.

10:15.367 --> 10:16.633
Ok, let me get this straight.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.433
You know men
who do bodily harm

10:20.500 --> 10:22.266
to private citizens for money?

10:22.767 --> 10:24.934
I can't deny it, Sophia. Yes.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Then take down this address.
Gladys Goldfein, 427--

10:28.066 --> 10:29.000
Ma!

10:32.400 --> 10:34.834
Rose, I know this is
a little overwhelming,

10:34.900 --> 10:36.967
but try to see it
through my eyes.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.066
I have my life back.

10:39.133 --> 10:42.800
I can call friends
and tell them where I am.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.633
You may have your life back,

10:44.700 --> 10:47.734
but I've had the rug pulled out
from under mine.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.367
Sweetheart, I had no choice.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.200
But Rose,
I want you to know

10:52.266 --> 10:54.967
I was never faking
how I feel about you.

10:55.033 --> 10:59.567
How can I believe you
or anything you've ever said to me?

10:59.633 --> 11:02.667
I know it sounds awful,
but it's not.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.800
I can be free, go back to Chicago,

11:04.867 --> 11:07.300
and, sweetheart,
I want you there with me.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.867
Chicago?

11:08.934 --> 11:11.400
Go to Chicago?

11:11.467 --> 11:13.033
I don't even know you!

11:13.100 --> 11:16.567
(sad music playing)

11:20.834 --> 11:23.633
(calm music playing)

11:23.700 --> 11:26.834
Oh, Rose, honey. We know
how confused you must feel.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.266
But no matter how unfocused
your emotions are,

11:30.333 --> 11:32.200
you must try to express them.

11:32.266 --> 11:35.266
So just go ahead and cry
if you want to, or scream,

11:35.333 --> 11:36.734
or throw things if you have to.

11:36.800 --> 11:41.533
But let those feelings out,
honey. Let them fill this room.

11:46.867 --> 11:48.000
Heck!

11:52.166 --> 11:54.600
I know, baby. I know.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.133
Oh, Rose, this is terrible.

11:57.200 --> 12:01.233
You have been robbed of
the most basic sense of security.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.100
You know, no matter what else
is happening, at the very least,

12:04.166 --> 12:07.533
I know that when I come home
at night, you are you,

12:07.600 --> 12:09.533
Blanche is Blanche, and ma,

12:09.600 --> 12:12.266
if she's taken her medication,
is my mother.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.967
I don't know what's real anymore.

12:17.033 --> 12:19.967
When I think of the things
I've told Miles,

12:20.033 --> 12:22.100
the things he's told me.

12:22.166 --> 12:24.367
The things we've told each other.

12:24.433 --> 12:26.233
Things we've said
in a restaurant.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.033
Things we've said on
our way to a restaurant.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.700
Things we've said
on the way home from--

12:30.767 --> 12:33.467
The two of you shared.
We get it.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.400
Who was I sharing with?

12:42.467 --> 12:45.600
If you say something to somebody
who isn't really who he is,

12:45.667 --> 12:48.967
have you actually
said anything, or not?

12:50.367 --> 12:52.867
And if he's heard it
as someone he really isn't,

12:52.934 --> 12:55.834
has anything you've said
actually been heard?

12:58.500 --> 13:00.467
Sorry. I wasn't listening.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.500
She wants to know
what to do about Miles.

13:06.567 --> 13:08.367
-Drop him.
-Ma.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.467
When someone you trusted
tells you something

13:10.533 --> 13:12.000
that later turns out
not to be true,

13:12.066 --> 13:14.367
wash your hands of them.
Give them a boot. Dump them.

13:14.433 --> 13:18.100
A little bit of Gladys Goldfein
slipping into this opinion, Ma?

13:18.166 --> 13:20.367
Who else are we talking about?

13:21.467 --> 13:25.333
Now I know how my friend
Mary Jane Von Helfenpfelfer felt.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.100
Oh, well, considering
what you've been through,

13:31.166 --> 13:32.367
go ahead, Rose.

13:34.266 --> 13:39.033
She took a vacation to Mexico,
and she found this poor, scrawny,

13:39.100 --> 13:41.834
helpless little
chihuahua puppy on the street.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.633
She brought it home
to St. Olaf with her

13:43.700 --> 13:45.633
and nursed it
back to health.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.967
She took it to bed with her.

13:49.033 --> 13:50.967
She taught it to fetch.

13:51.033 --> 13:53.600
She'd throw a ball,
he'd bring it back,

13:53.667 --> 13:56.500
she'd throw a ball,
he'd bring it back.

13:56.567 --> 14:00.266
I guess I don't have to tell you
that's pretty much what fetch is.

14:05.767 --> 14:08.734
How much longer are we going
to circle the airport, Rose?

14:09.967 --> 14:11.967
You want to bring this baby in?

14:13.533 --> 14:15.934
When she took
the puppy in for shots,

14:16.000 --> 14:17.600
the vet told her the bad news.

14:17.667 --> 14:21.900
He said, "This is no chihuahua.
This is a rat."

14:39.066 --> 14:40.900
And the point, Aesop?

14:43.233 --> 14:45.233
I thought Miles was a chihuahua.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.967
It turns out he was a rat.

14:48.433 --> 14:51.133
I once prepared
a six-course meal

14:51.200 --> 14:53.166
with what I thought
was chicken.

14:53.233 --> 14:56.133
-It turned out to be--
-Ma!

14:57.867 --> 15:01.667
Rose, in my heart, I cannot
believe that Miles is a rat.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.500
He just fell in
with the wrong people.

15:04.567 --> 15:07.133
You have a date
with him tomorrow night.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.066
Keep it.

15:08.133 --> 15:12.700
I'm sure you'll find he's the same
caring, sensitive man

15:12.767 --> 15:14.133
you've known all along.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.967
My God, it wasn't
my confirmation dinner, was it?

15:25.467 --> 15:26.800
Your pop sure made
everyone laugh

15:26.867 --> 15:29.033
when he made
the little feet dance.

15:31.033 --> 15:35.767
(serene music playing)

15:38.900 --> 15:40.633
Rose, how did your date go?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.867
Dorothy, you were
absolutely right.

15:42.934 --> 15:45.066
It was better than
I could have dreamed.

15:45.133 --> 15:46.900
When we sat down to our meal,

15:46.967 --> 15:50.100
Nick ordered a whiskey neat
and a shrimp cocktail,

15:50.166 --> 15:51.834
which was positively uncanny

15:51.900 --> 15:53.800
because Miles always
began his meal

15:53.867 --> 15:57.667
with a whiskey neat
and a shrimp cocktail.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.767
You haven't had
much experience

15:59.834 --> 16:02.600
with the uncanny, have you,
Rose?

16:02.667 --> 16:04.767
Oh, Rose, I thought
I heard your voice.

16:04.834 --> 16:07.600
Start at the beginning
and tell us everything.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.100
Booze, shrimp,
you're up to speed. Go, Rose.

16:12.300 --> 16:16.066
Well, to begin with, I had
an absolutely fantastic time.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.800
He's the same man.

16:17.867 --> 16:21.400
The man I love,
and that's why I told him...

16:22.233 --> 16:23.934
I'd go to Chicago with him.

16:24.433 --> 16:25.467
You'd what?

16:25.533 --> 16:27.533
You're not moving, are you?

16:27.600 --> 16:30.767
Only for three months
so he can clean up business.

16:30.834 --> 16:34.500
Oh, Rose, I'm so happy
everything worked out.

16:34.567 --> 16:37.500
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'll miss you,

16:37.567 --> 16:41.767
your laugh, your smile,
your St. Olaf stories.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.266
Ok. I'm over it now.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.767
(mellow music playing)

16:50.266 --> 16:51.734
Gee, Ma. I think it's nice

16:51.800 --> 16:55.133
how things are working out
for Rose and Miles.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.233
Well, it had to happen
sometime, pussycat.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.300
-(doorbell rings)
-Rose found a man.

16:59.367 --> 17:02.467
And pretty soon,
Blanche will find a man.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.934
And before you know it, you,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.066
you should buy
a parakeet or something.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.800
Gladys!
Honey, how are you?

17:11.867 --> 17:13.934
Fine, Dorothy.
Is your mother home?

17:15.500 --> 17:17.100
No. I can't say she is.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.900
She keeps hanging up on me.

17:19.967 --> 17:21.333
You sure she isn't home?

17:22.200 --> 17:24.367
No. I still can't say that.

17:24.433 --> 17:26.467
Would you like
to leave a message?

17:26.533 --> 17:29.934
Oh, I don't know.
I just wanted to apologize.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.767
What took you so long?

17:33.433 --> 17:36.967
Ma, when did you get in?

17:37.033 --> 17:38.367
Oh, Dorothy, grow up.

17:42.433 --> 17:45.000
Are you reading from a prepared
statement, Goldfein,

17:45.066 --> 17:47.133
or are you cocky
enough to wing it?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.100
I came because
I was thinking

17:49.166 --> 17:52.000
at our age, the last thing
you say to somebody

17:52.066 --> 17:54.934
might be the last
thing you say.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.467
I just want you
to know I'm sorry.

17:59.533 --> 18:01.633
I want to take you to the concert.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.133
-Bubbie.
<i>-Faccia bella!</i>

18:06.667 --> 18:07.967
Dorothy, learn from this.

18:08.033 --> 18:09.867
Friendships are built on,

18:09.934 --> 18:14.433
loyalty, mutual respect, trust,
give me my ticket.

18:16.767 --> 18:17.600
What?

18:17.667 --> 18:19.367
Gladys, you yutz.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.800
These aren't for Tony Bennett.
They're for Tony Martin.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.533
Of course, they are.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.300
You think I'd camp overnight
for tickets to Tony Bennett?

18:27.133 --> 18:30.233
Take Milton.
Have a swell time.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.867
Only this time, don't throw
your underwear on stage.

18:32.934 --> 18:35.066
Then why go?

18:38.533 --> 18:39.934
Why couldn't
they put Tony Bennett

18:40.000 --> 18:42.133
and Tony Martin
on the same bill?

18:42.200 --> 18:43.467
Who am I kidding?

18:43.533 --> 18:45.100
There will never
be another Woodstock.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.900
I am never shopping
at Fiedler Brothers again.

18:50.967 --> 18:52.200
I beg your pardon?

18:52.266 --> 18:55.533
It's too late.
I've never been so humiliated.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.033
What about the time
you lost your handcuffs key

18:58.100 --> 19:00.667
and had to go with that guy
on his mail route?

19:08.767 --> 19:11.133
Before I returned the dress,

19:11.200 --> 19:13.367
I was so busy putting
the price tags back on,

19:13.433 --> 19:16.233
I neglected to remove
the dry cleaning tag.

19:18.934 --> 19:21.300
Not only did they refuse
to take the dress back,

19:21.367 --> 19:25.333
the store manager accused me
of being dishonest.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.200
Oh, that's terrible, Blanche.

19:30.266 --> 19:33.133
If I were you, I'd take
my dishonesty elsewhere.

19:35.433 --> 19:37.533
They made me pay.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.000
$300 for a dress
I didn't even want.

19:40.066 --> 19:42.166
Blanche, it's only fair.

19:42.233 --> 19:44.934
You tried something crooked,
and you got caught.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.633
You'll have to scrimp
and cut corners

19:47.700 --> 19:49.567
and find some way
to pay for it.

19:49.633 --> 19:50.967
I already have.

19:51.033 --> 19:54.033
The rent increases
go into effect tomorrow.

19:55.433 --> 19:56.767
All except Sophia.

19:57.266 --> 19:58.633
Why not her?

19:58.700 --> 20:00.333
The rent increase was her idea.

20:06.033 --> 20:09.967
So I'm the one musketeer.
I'll make new friends.

20:11.033 --> 20:13.633
I heard this terrible
thing on the radio.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.266
We go through this every time.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.300
This is merely a test.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.834
In the event of an actual
emergency...

20:20.900 --> 20:23.200
The news!
I was listening to the news.

20:23.266 --> 20:26.333
-The cheese-man isn't dead.
-What?

20:26.400 --> 20:30.400
The coroner's investigation proved
Moran staged the whole thing.

20:30.467 --> 20:31.667
He's alive?

20:31.734 --> 20:34.166
He knows Miles is seeing Rose
and Rose knows me,

20:34.233 --> 20:36.767
and they always hold
the prettiest one hostage.

20:40.834 --> 20:45.266
Oh, if I could just do something
to make myself less attractive.

20:45.767 --> 20:47.333
Try soap and water.

20:50.934 --> 20:54.333
I have to call Miles.
He must be worried sick.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.433
-Rose!
-Oh, darling, we heard.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.033
Rose, it's awful.
There isn't much time.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.300
I'm so sorry about this, Miles.

21:02.367 --> 21:04.133
Can we get him out?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.500
I don't want to be killed.

21:05.567 --> 21:08.500
That would be like getting tackled
on the one-yard line.

21:10.367 --> 21:13.500
Rose, you realize Chicago's out
of the picture now.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.834
Can't we just stay in Miami?

21:15.900 --> 21:18.467
That's impossible too, sweetheart.

21:18.533 --> 21:22.066
I don't know where the government's
going to move us.

21:22.133 --> 21:24.066
All I know is everything's
going to be fine

21:24.133 --> 21:25.633
as long as we're together.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.200
I can't believe
this is happening.

21:28.266 --> 21:30.166
Maybe we better
try Springfield.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.200
He'd never find us in Springfield.

21:32.266 --> 21:33.400
Which Springfield?

21:33.467 --> 21:34.600
Aha!

21:36.767 --> 21:38.166
Girls, don't worry.

21:38.233 --> 21:41.266
When Miles and I are settled,
we'll let you know where we are.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.300
We can't let anybody
know where we are.

21:44.367 --> 21:47.200
We won't tell a soul,
even when we visit.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.000
You can't visit.
It's too dangerous.

21:49.066 --> 21:50.467
We'll be able to phone.

21:50.533 --> 21:51.667
No.

21:51.734 --> 21:53.133
What about my children?

21:54.700 --> 21:57.533
Rose, it's just too risky.
For us and for them.

21:58.033 --> 22:02.700
Oh, Miles,
this is an impossible decision.

22:04.033 --> 22:06.166
Oh, I love you so much.

22:06.233 --> 22:08.367
Rose, I love you too.

22:08.433 --> 22:12.667
But I also love my friends
and my family,

22:12.734 --> 22:14.367
and the thought of leaving...

22:18.133 --> 22:19.300
I'm sorry.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.667
All right.

22:22.734 --> 22:24.500
I understand.

22:24.567 --> 22:27.233
Oh, I'm going
to miss you, Miles.

22:27.300 --> 22:30.767
There won't be a day
I won't be thinking about you.

22:33.467 --> 22:34.400
Goodbye.

22:35.767 --> 22:37.033
Rose, darling.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.266
You take good care of her, ladies.

22:45.433 --> 22:47.700
Miles, your poetry book.

22:47.767 --> 22:51.700
Keep it, and when you
read page 73, think of me.

23:02.166 --> 23:08.567
"And when to the heart of man
was it ever less than a treason

23:08.633 --> 23:14.033
to bow and accept the end
of a love or of a season?"

23:23.867 --> 23:26.967
(theme music playing)
