00:06.484 --> 00:08.051
So you'll just park here,

00:08.182 --> 00:09.618
and you'll find
the trailhead there.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.533
Now, it is bear season,
so if you see any...

00:11.663 --> 00:13.317
Do not hug them!

00:13.448 --> 00:15.145
You're gonna want to hug 'em,
but don't.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.191
Just, uh, keep your distance.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.236
Business seems to be
picking up.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.933
Yeah.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.153
So far it's just been
antiquers and bird-watchers.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.547
Would love to find a way
to expand our customer base.

00:25.677 --> 00:29.246
Yes, how can we get the halls
of this once proud home

00:29.377 --> 00:30.900

more commoners?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.728
Hey, babe. What's going on?

00:32.858 --> 00:34.034
Yeah, I just sent the guests
on a hike.

00:34.164 --> 00:34.991
They were raving
about the breakfast

00:35.122 --> 00:35.731
you cooked this morning.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.211
It looked amazing.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.342
Smellwise, I
would rank it

00:38.473 --> 00:40.823
somewhere between
patchouli and weed.

00:40.953 --> 00:43.347
Speaking of cooking, you know
what else was cooking?

00:43.478 --> 00:46.394
My jump shot on the court today.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.265
TREVOR:
Ugh, I miss playing basketball.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.137
At Camp Ramah, I once hit
a game-winning three,

00:50.267 --> 00:53.792
while being fouled,
and never even lost my yarmulke.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.490
So were you just
shooting around?

00:55.620 --> 00:57.840
No, I played pickup, and
I met some really cool locals,

00:57.970 --> 00:59.711
and they found out that we run
the Woodstone B and B,

00:59.842 --> 01:01.452
and they were so into it.

01:01.583 --> 01:02.714
Are we, like, local celebrities?

01:02.845 --> 01:04.673
Hey, so listen,

01:04.803 --> 01:05.891
Micah mentioned that
they might want to come over

01:06.022 --> 01:07.328
tomorrow and watch the game.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.504
Oh, Micah's kind of
like their leader.

01:09.634 --> 01:10.766
The leader?Uh...

01:10.896 --> 01:12.420
boss? They work together?

01:12.550 --> 01:14.378
I don't know, anyway,
would that be cool?

01:14.509 --> 01:16.815
Well, it sounds to me like
somebody made some friends.

01:16.946 --> 01:19.253
Good for you for putting
yourself out there.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.168
Come on, babe,
it's not that big of a deal.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.257
Yeah, what are you,
his mom?

01:23.387 --> 01:24.780
No, it's just,
it's been harder on Jay.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.651
We both left our friends
in the city,

01:26.782 --> 01:28.218
but I have all you guys
to talk to.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.220
And I know that sometimes
he must feel left out.

01:30.351 --> 01:33.223
[chuckles] Yeah, like now
could be one of those times.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.095
Oh, sorry, I just...

01:35.225 --> 01:37.488

02:00.207 --> 02:01.077
Well, yeah, that's because
months and quarters

don't always line up exactly.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.211

02:36.895 --> 02:38.462
Mm.My wife inherited it,

02:38.593 --> 02:39.681
and then we moved up
from the city

02:39.811 --> 02:41.552
to turn it into a B and B.

to pretend anymore.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.043
That's nice.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.350
Well, Jay, I, uh,
I have a philosophy,

02:56.480 --> 02:57.699
born out of basketball.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.135
This is exciting.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.528
He doesn't share this
with everybody.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.270
So, at the beginning
of every pickup game,

03:03.400 --> 03:06.882
each team has a choice: take the
ball first or choose direction.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.579
Most people take the ball.JAY: Well, yeah.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.625
You want to make sure
you get off to a good start.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.888
MICAH: But what about the sun?
What about the wind?

03:13.018 --> 03:14.324
Ball goes away,

03:14.455 --> 03:17.066
direction... lasts forever.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.676
Interesting.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.983
I got a funny feeling
about this guy.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.680
Right? I've got tingles.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.160
MICAH: Jay, you chose direction

03:24.291 --> 03:25.248
with this B and B.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.728
You chose to focus
on the long run,

03:26.858 --> 03:29.905
but wouldn't it be nice
to have direction and ball?

03:30.035 --> 03:31.950
[chuckles]So nice.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.692
Jay, let me show you something.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.695
What is that?

03:37.826 --> 03:40.437
This is ball.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.138
Yes! Yes!

03:46.269 --> 03:48.358
Sam, we got a problem.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.665
These "friends" of Jay's--
and I hesitate to say this

03:50.795 --> 03:52.014
because the one
is very hot--

03:52.144 --> 03:53.276
but they got to go.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.625
What are you talking about?

03:54.756 --> 03:56.366
They're into some
pyramid scheme.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.411
They're working for this
company that's selling

03:57.541 --> 03:58.716
these vitamin patches,

03:58.847 --> 04:00.327
and they're trying
to recruit Jay

04:00.457 --> 04:01.806
to sell them, too.Vitamin patches?

04:01.937 --> 04:03.765
It's like modern-day
snake oil.

04:03.895 --> 04:07.638
The cure-all elixir that gives
you vim, vigor and verve?

04:07.769 --> 04:09.727
What's the problem here?

04:09.858 --> 04:11.903
Sam, if Trevor's saying
even the hot one has to go,

04:12.034 --> 04:13.775
we have to take him seriously.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.472
That is alarming, but I'm sure
there's an innocent explanation.

04:15.603 --> 04:18.954
Samantha, if Jay truly
is being offered

04:19.084 --> 04:21.130
a snake oil opportunity,

04:21.261 --> 04:23.698
one must at least
entertain the notion.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.352
We're not buying snake oil,

04:25.482 --> 04:27.702
or whatever it is
they're selling.Oh, all right,

04:27.832 --> 04:30.182
I guess you could
press your own snakes,

04:30.313 --> 04:33.273
but you're going to have
to move the rugs.

04:34.404 --> 04:35.840
Hey, I brought snacks.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.364
Oh, where'’s Jay?

04:37.494 --> 04:39.366
He's giving Micah a tour.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.890
It's really exciting that
he's getting one-on-one time

04:42.020 --> 04:43.500
with Micah so soon.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.502
It took me six months,

04:45.633 --> 04:47.504
but then, I don't
have a mansion.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.593
Yeah, Norm doesn't
have a lot of things:

04:49.724 --> 04:51.900
self-esteem, a mother
that loved him,

04:52.030 --> 04:53.597
a filter when it comes to
sharing personal details.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.904
Norm, you're being
really negative.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.819
Do you think
you need to re-patch?

04:57.949 --> 05:00.125
No, I'm okay.Norm, re-patch.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.301
Okay.Thank you.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.041
Hot and bossy.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.653
Okay, she can stay.
But the rest have to go.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.568
Okay, so... [clears throat]

05:07.698 --> 05:09.396
what is the deal
with these patches?

05:09.526 --> 05:11.441
They're a proprietary blend
of vitamins and nutrients

05:11.572 --> 05:13.225
that enhance one's
quality of life.

05:13.356 --> 05:14.575
Okay.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.620
So is that, like,
based in science, or...

05:16.751 --> 05:18.796
The recipe came to Micah
in a dream.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.711
Yeah, they helped alleviate
Norm's back acne.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.235
He mentioned that
several times.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.585
And are you guys, like,
in a company?

05:24.715 --> 05:26.108
Are you working together or...

05:26.238 --> 05:28.197
I mean, we don't like
to use the term company.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.851
It's more of a collective.

05:29.981 --> 05:32.027
We work together,
live together.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.420
Live together?

05:33.550 --> 05:35.073
Okay, this is weirder
than a pyramid scheme.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.554
That's because it's
not a pyramid scheme.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.164
It's a cult.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.993
You're saying Jay
accidentally joined a cult?

05:42.124 --> 05:45.910
Well, he's not in yet,
but it's looking good.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.614
This is just perfect-- Jay
finally makes some friends

05:53.744 --> 05:55.311
up here and they turn out
to be in a cult.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.530
Sam, this is a good thing.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.271
He's gonna make
lifelong friends.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.621
He's not joining a cult, Flower.

06:00.751 --> 06:01.622
Well, what if he wants to?

06:01.752 --> 06:03.188
Trust me, he doesn't.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.712
Okay, well, be careful,

06:04.842 --> 06:06.409
because sometimes when
a family member asks someone

06:06.540 --> 06:08.019
to choose between them
and the cult,

06:08.150 --> 06:10.021
they choose the cult.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.458
I just...

06:11.588 --> 06:12.850
I'm worried about Jay's feelings
getting hurt.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.113
There don't seem to be
many fun people our age

06:15.244 --> 06:18.769
up in this town, and he seemed
like he was so excited.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.380
Jay just meet these people.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.772
He'll get over it.Mm.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.166
Sam, this guy
Micah's incredible.

06:24.296 --> 06:26.037
I mean, I've never
met anyone like him.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.517
Or he'll be crushed.

06:27.648 --> 06:28.649
Either way, it's
something to watch.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.434
He just has this great
perspective on life.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.175
It's a cult, Jay.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.785
He's in a cult.
He's the cult leader.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.918
What are you talking about?

06:37.048 --> 06:38.398
Flower told me,
she recognized all the signs.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.008
Oh, Flower?

06:40.138 --> 06:42.271
The one who asked you what
your name was yesterday,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.708
a year after we moved in?

06:44.839 --> 06:47.102
Okay, well, that's not nice
to point out.

06:47.232 --> 06:48.451
I want to say...

06:48.582 --> 06:49.974
...Larry?

06:50.105 --> 06:51.454
Jay, come on.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.369
They all live together
in some weird collective.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.153
And Micah came up
with the formula for the patch

06:55.284 --> 06:56.503
in a dream.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.069
That's so cool.JAY: Yeah, okay,

06:58.200 --> 06:59.506
so he's a bit hippie-dippie,
I'll give you that,

06:59.636 --> 07:01.029
but you don't
know him yet.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.552
Plus, lots of people
live together.

07:02.683 --> 07:03.945

07:04.075 --> 07:05.599
That's about a bunch of
people who live together.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.992
They actually live
in three different apartments.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.385
It was four.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.604
Ross have own place
with Marcel, the monkey.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.127
Oh.You know what?

07:12.257 --> 07:13.781
I'm not debating
Friendswith you, okay?

07:13.911 --> 07:15.173
I really like Micah

07:15.304 --> 07:16.697
and I hoping you'd
give him a chance.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.394
He's helping us out, big-time.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.700
What do you mean?The patches.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.484
He gave us ten boxes for free

07:21.615 --> 07:22.833
to sell on consignment.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.139
Jay, you do not want to be

07:24.269 --> 07:25.575

07:25.706 --> 07:27.055

07:43.158 --> 07:45.943
I'm a mean old sourpuss,
just like you wanted.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.293
No more smiles,
no more compliments,

07:48.424 --> 07:50.557
no more scalp massages
while you sleep

07:50.687 --> 07:52.559
to stimulate your dreams.Wait,

07:52.689 --> 07:53.734
you massage me while I sleep?

07:53.864 --> 07:56.171
No. I used to.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.434
But that's all over now.

07:58.565 --> 08:01.306
For the rest of eternity,
you're rooming with

08:01.437 --> 08:03.657
a joyless, sulking void.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.876
Pete, I don't
know what to say.

08:06.007 --> 08:09.140
That you miss friendly
old classic Pete now?

08:09.271 --> 08:10.751
No. I like this.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.622
Thanks, buddy.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.583
Son of a B-word.

08:18.759 --> 08:22.023
Screw it. In a way,
all major religions are cults.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.721
Who are we to judge
these nines and tens?

08:24.852 --> 08:26.636
HETTY:
that Micah reminds me

08:26.767 --> 08:28.508
of a stable boy
who worked here once.

08:28.638 --> 08:31.685
Some found his live body
desirable.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.861
Not me, of course,
because I am a lady.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.472
Ooh, yeah, touch those toes.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.605
Hey, Micah.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.389
Oh, Jay. Hey.Hey.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.173
Hope you don't mind,
I invited a few teammates

08:42.304 --> 08:44.436
here to hang out at
your beautiful abode.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.221
Yeah, th-that should be okay.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.353
Look, I know some
of you guys live together,

08:48.484 --> 08:50.617
but this is mostly a business,

08:50.747 --> 08:51.966
this patch thing, right?

08:52.096 --> 08:53.968
Yeah. Of course, of course.

08:54.098 --> 08:57.885
It's a business, a community,
a way of life.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.322
Okay...

09:00.452 --> 09:02.280
Jay, please stretch, okay?
It's important to stay limber.

09:02.411 --> 09:03.978
Especially if you're
gonna live forever.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.154
Yeah, and just, uh,
when you say "live forever,"

09:06.284 --> 09:08.678
you mean that the patch
makes you feel like

09:08.809 --> 09:10.027
you're gonna live forever.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.334
Exactly.
Because you can.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.683
What was that?

09:13.814 --> 09:15.598
Oh, he's quite insane.

09:15.729 --> 09:16.904
Jay, how old
do you think I am?

09:17.034 --> 09:19.297
Uh, I don't know, man.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.386
Um, 35?

09:21.517 --> 09:24.564
I'm 742 years young.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.176
And you look great.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.443
Uh, Flower, you got a sec?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.663
I wanted to ask you about
what you said earlier

09:36.793 --> 09:39.100
about how sometimes people
choose a cult over their family.

09:39.230 --> 09:42.233
I kinda got a sense there
was more to that story.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.540
I don't really want
to talk about it.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.629
I understand.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.025
Hey, Flower.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.896
Oh, hey, Alberta.
What's up?Girl!

09:53.027 --> 09:54.463
You were just telling
me the story about

09:54.594 --> 09:56.900
you choosing your cult
over a family member.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.162
The one about my brother?
Where was I?

09:58.293 --> 09:59.729
At the beginning.Right.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.862
Okay, well, back when
I was in the cult,

10:01.992 --> 10:03.690
my brother showed up,
and he tried to get me

10:03.820 --> 10:04.995
to come home.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.997
So the cult banned him
from the property

10:07.128 --> 10:09.086
and barred me from ever
speaking to him again.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.872
If only he'd never tried
to get me out of that cult.

10:12.002 --> 10:12.699
Well, it sounded like
your brother was

10:12.829 --> 10:14.439
just trying to protect you.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.311
Maybe you should be angry
at the people who made you

10:16.441 --> 10:18.748
choose between them
and your own family.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.316
You mean the cult?

10:21.446 --> 10:23.623
Yes, Flower.Huh.

10:23.753 --> 10:27.583
Nobody ever talks about
a cult being in the wrong.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.673
I feel like people do.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.458
Sam, it is a full-blown cult.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.025
Now he figures it out.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.419
Why didn't he just listen to you
in the first place?

10:37.549 --> 10:39.073
Sometimes men very stubborn,

10:39.203 --> 10:40.596
like when Ross claim to
read Rachel's letter

10:40.727 --> 10:42.467
instead of just admit
he fall asleep.

10:42.598 --> 10:43.599
JAY:
This is bad.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.384
He said he was 742 years old.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.647
Sounds young to me.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.474
It's okay, just calm down.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.389
Okay, we'll tell Micah
he has to leave,

10:51.520 --> 10:52.913
and then we can put
this whole thing behind us.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's not be rash.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.699
Trevor, they're a cult.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.702
Yes, but this could be
a Heaven's Gate situation.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.357
Sam, I'm just saying if
things break the right way,

11:02.487 --> 11:04.620
we could be looking at
some sexy new ghosts.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.014
Let's go.Please.

11:07.144 --> 11:07.884
I heard them talking about
something called

11:08.015 --> 11:08.885
"the final patch."

11:09.016 --> 11:11.279
That sounded promising.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.020
Hey, hey, whoa.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.152
What is all this?They're moving in.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.850
We're moving in.
[chuckles]

11:16.980 --> 11:18.329
Where do you want this, Micah?

11:18.460 --> 11:20.984
Oh, I'm upstairs on the
left with the wives.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.334
[grunts] This ain't gonna
be good for business.

11:23.465 --> 11:26.163
No, no, no, no, all of you
have to leave.

11:26.294 --> 11:27.730
Yeah, we're not gonna do that.
Jay, do you remember

11:27.861 --> 11:29.384
this very long
bill of lading

11:29.514 --> 11:31.081
that accompanied the box
of patches that I gave you?

11:31.212 --> 11:33.431
Oh, yeah, I remember that
it was very long.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.737
And remember that
you signed it

11:34.868 --> 11:35.782
and I gave you a receipt?

11:35.912 --> 11:38.132
Oh, come on.Jay...

11:38.262 --> 11:39.655
Well, buried in the
fine print was a clause

11:39.786 --> 11:42.484
that allowed us to move in
in exchange for the patches.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.704
See? Right there.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.706
Oh, come on, man,
that is so tiny.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.621
That is a very underhanded
business maneuver.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.275
Tip of my cap
to you, sir.

11:51.406 --> 11:54.104
You all have to leave or
we are gonna call the cops.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.498
We have a
signed contract.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.978
Dude, this is insane.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.544
What's your plan?
You're just gonna squat

11:59.675 --> 12:02.243
in our house forever?Of course not. No.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.680
The lease explicitly says
it's for no longer

12:04.811 --> 12:06.160
than one trillion years.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.902
So after that we'll be
out of your hair.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.251
Oh, thank God.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.861
I thought they were gonna
be here forever.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.651
So the good news is the lawyer
says we are in the right,

12:19.782 --> 12:21.218
and the contract will
never hold up.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.437
ALL: Yes!Huzzah!

12:22.567 --> 12:23.786
But it's going
to take months

12:23.917 --> 12:25.092
and thousands of dollars
in legal fees.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.528
Months?

12:26.658 --> 12:28.095
We can't run a B and B
with a cult living here.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.140
We'll be driven
out of business.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.186
Pete, please just tell us
everything is gonna be okay.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.405
We really need some of your
Pinecone Trooper

12:34.536 --> 12:35.842
can-do spirit right now.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.365
No can do, Sam.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.280
I've changed.
I'm dark now.

12:39.410 --> 12:42.544
Because life is meaningless
and full of suffering.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.851
What'd he say?Nothing helpful.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.678
There actually is
one foolproof way

12:46.809 --> 12:49.333
to break up a cult,
and it's so easy.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.555
I'm not sleeping with Micah.Cool.

12:53.685 --> 12:54.861
Thanks for the update.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.950
It was something
Flower suggested.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.081
Nothing breaks up
a cult faster

12:58.212 --> 13:00.214
than an outsider
sleeping with the leader.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.998
Great. Does anybody else
have an idea?

13:02.129 --> 13:03.695
Samantha, just talk to them.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.089
As a delegate to the Second
Continental Congress,

13:06.220 --> 13:07.961
I partook in
difficult negotiations.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.614
But through dialogue,

13:09.745 --> 13:12.313
we found interests that aligned.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.141
Yes, if a bunch of
white male landowners

13:14.271 --> 13:16.970
can find common ground,
then anything is possible.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.450
Exactly. Point is,
I don't think they want

13:19.581 --> 13:21.713
a protracted legal fight either.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.063
That's true.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.587
Maybe they will
listen to reason.

13:25.717 --> 13:28.329
Oh, sure, 'cause cults
are famously reasonable.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.897
Not loving the new Pete.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.768
[cheering on TV]

13:32.899 --> 13:34.683
Uh, what are ya'll doing?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.512
I'm watching TV with Alana,
and Flower's third-wheeling it.

13:37.642 --> 13:38.818
Trevor, that girl don't even
know you're there.

13:38.948 --> 13:39.993
Listen, Flower,

13:40.123 --> 13:41.255
I had an idea.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.083
Why don'’t we look up
your brother?

13:43.213 --> 13:44.998
I mean, we don't know,
maybe he's still alive.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.303
Oh, no.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.870
After I got out of the cult,

13:48.001 --> 13:50.655
I heard he'd been killed
in Vietnam, so...

13:50.786 --> 13:53.136
Oh, Flower, you poor girl.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.790
Yeah, Flower, I'm so sorry.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.749
I wish I'd been there
to convince him not to go.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.056
He spent his whole life
protecting me

14:00.187 --> 14:03.016
and the one time my big brother
needed protecting,

14:03.146 --> 14:04.800
I wasn't there for him.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.062
He was MIA.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.498
MIA?

14:07.629 --> 14:09.283
Murdered in action.

14:09.413 --> 14:13.330
Flower, MIA means
"missingin action."It does?

14:13.461 --> 14:14.810
It's also the airport code
for Miami, where I spent

14:14.941 --> 14:16.681
some baller weekends.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.336
KIA is "killed in acion."

14:19.467 --> 14:22.383
Wait, so you're saying
he might still be alive?

14:22.513 --> 14:24.646
Well, going missing in a war
is not a great sign.

14:24.776 --> 14:27.127
And even if he made it out,
he may be dead by now.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.563
But you're saying
there's a chance?

14:28.693 --> 14:30.217
You want me to look him up?Look up who?

14:30.347 --> 14:32.262
Your brother!Oh, what about him?

14:32.393 --> 14:33.263
Child, just look him up.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.438
I'll look him up.

14:38.529 --> 14:41.881
[flatulence]

14:42.011 --> 14:44.927
I love how comfortable
she feels around me.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.103
JAY:
So what do you say?

14:47.234 --> 14:50.019
We can avoid months
of headache and cost,

14:50.150 --> 14:51.194
And you could just
clear out now.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.283
Nah, we're good.
I mean, what's a few months

14:53.414 --> 14:54.719
when we're gonna live forever?

14:54.850 --> 14:58.375
Oh, why would anyone want
to live forever?

14:58.506 --> 14:59.507
Tell me about it.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.422
Wait a minute.

15:01.552 --> 15:02.466
Excuse me?

15:02.597 --> 15:04.860
Have you ever thought about

15:04.991 --> 15:07.297
what living forever
would actually mean?ALANA: Of course.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.472
It's gonna be amazing.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.779
[scoffs]
I mean, in theory, yeah.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.737
But for one thing, you're gonna
get sick of each other.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.391
[ghosts affirming]

15:14.522 --> 15:17.438
At least they get to change
their itchy shirts.

15:17.568 --> 15:18.961
A small price to pay
for the gift of eternity.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.659
Okay, but if you
give me a minute,

15:21.790 --> 15:24.010
some other specifics
as to why it sucks

15:24.140 --> 15:26.055
will come to me.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.535
Sunsets no longer very nice.Mm.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.277
THORFINN:
Same thing over and over.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.756
Oh, yeah. Yes.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.062
Eternity take what was
once beautiful

15:33.193 --> 15:36.065
and turn into nothing.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.720
Oh, sunsets, what about those?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.069
I mean, right now
they're beautiful,

15:40.200 --> 15:41.897
but in, like, a thousand years,

15:42.028 --> 15:43.986
you'll have seen so many,
they will just be boring.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.945
Look, whatever you're
trying to do,

15:46.075 --> 15:47.294
it's not working.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.296
Nothing is gonna break us apart.So, what--

15:49.426 --> 15:51.472
you just want to waste
months in court

15:51.602 --> 15:53.256
when you're gonna end up
getting kicked out anyways?

15:53.387 --> 15:55.215
By then, you'll be one of us.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.912
We're not going anywhere.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.523
So, unless you have
anything else to say,

15:59.654 --> 16:00.916
We'll be hearing
from your lawyers

16:01.047 --> 16:02.483
and seeing you in the hallway.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.702
I slept with Micah.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.008
[chuckles]

16:06.139 --> 16:07.836
Micah would never
sleep with you.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.098
You're an outsider.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.622
Well, it's true,
and I am sorry

16:11.753 --> 16:14.147
if that drives a wedge.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.148
Wait, is this true?

16:15.278 --> 16:17.019
I am so proud of you, Sam.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.761
He talked about how forbidden
it was the whole time,

16:19.891 --> 16:21.893
which only made it hotter,
he said.

16:22.024 --> 16:25.941
This woman is lying
to you, guys.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.464
Okay?
You got to believe me.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.727
I would never sleep with
anyone but your wives.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.861
Tell them you know about
the moles on his right buttock.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.602
Trust me.

16:34.732 --> 16:38.780
Um, he has some moles
on his right butt cheek.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.477
That's just a lucky guess.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.653
Three moles
in a crescent formation.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.395
Three moles. They're shaped
kind of like a crescent.

16:45.526 --> 16:48.050
[gasps]She knows about
the Dots of Destiny?

16:48.181 --> 16:49.704
You watch him
change or something?

16:50.748 --> 16:52.185
No further questions.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.404
You promised you wouldn't
sleep with an outsider.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.058
And if you lied about that,
what else are you lying about?

16:56.189 --> 16:58.234
Yeah, now I'm starting
to question

16:58.365 --> 16:59.757
this whole immortality thing.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.456
Like, do we even get
our own planets?Well?

17:02.586 --> 17:05.372
It's working, Sam.MICAH: Guys, guys,
I did not sleep with her.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.200
Everybody's getting
their own planets,

17:07.330 --> 17:09.289
my bodily fluids still
cure the common cold.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.768
This was a test.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.988
It was a test,
and you all passed.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.990
Oh, it was another test.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.123
Like when we
looked you up online

17:17.253 --> 17:19.777
and it said you were
born in 1990.Exactly.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.345
And let this be a reminder

17:22.476 --> 17:24.782
that I can test you
at any moment.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.219
So let's leave this place

17:26.349 --> 17:29.831
and put this toxic
non-believer behind us.

17:29.961 --> 17:34.096
No! Alana, wait.
Just wait... Alana.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.403
Oh, can eternity
get any worse?

17:36.533 --> 17:37.708
[cries out]

17:37.839 --> 17:39.362
You sorta teed that one up.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.147
And just so you know, Jay,

17:41.277 --> 17:43.671
I thought you were really cool
and good at basketball.

17:43.801 --> 17:46.239
Aw. Maybe we can
do it again sometime.

17:46.369 --> 17:50.069
[clears throat]But I don't want to.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.593
Mm. Marriage.
[laughs]

17:52.723 --> 17:54.029
That's the real cult.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.336
I thought you said
this wasn't a cult.

17:56.466 --> 17:59.382
It was another test, Norm.Oh.

17:59.513 --> 18:00.644
MICAH:
And you failed it.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.785
What's going on?

18:10.915 --> 18:13.527
Nothing. Uh, just looking
at a stupid sunset.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.050
Certainly not getting
any enjoyment out of it.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.661
Okay, look, just go back
to being yourself, buddy.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.620
Why?

18:19.750 --> 18:21.665
All that talk about eternity
earlier made me realize

18:21.796 --> 18:23.711
that maybe eternity's
gotten to me, a little.

18:23.841 --> 18:27.280
It's gotten to all of us.
Except, somehow, to you.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.498
[short chuckle]
How do you do it?

18:28.629 --> 18:30.805
First of all, I
haven't been around

18:30.935 --> 18:33.416
as long as you have,
and I don't know,

18:33.547 --> 18:35.549
I try to stay
positive, you know?

18:35.679 --> 18:37.246
Sure, sunsets get

18:37.377 --> 18:39.683
a little repetitive, but...

18:39.814 --> 18:43.296
every once in a while,
one knocks your socks off.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.341
And that's what
keeps you looking.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.562
Probably sounds a little corny.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.565
[short chuckle]
That sounds very corny.

18:51.695 --> 18:52.740
SAM:
Hey, Flower, do
you have a minute?

18:52.870 --> 18:54.437
Sure, man.

18:54.568 --> 18:57.527
So, Alberta and Trevor
told me all about your brother.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.095
Sam looked him up.He's still alive, Flower.

19:00.226 --> 19:03.620
Robbie's alive?
He's AIA?

19:03.751 --> 19:06.536
SAM:
Yeah. And I hope
you don't mind, but

19:06.667 --> 19:09.496
I emailed him and I told him
that I was in the cult with you.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.237
And I said your
biggest regret was

19:11.367 --> 19:12.847
not making up with your brother.

19:12.977 --> 19:16.459
So, I just got an email back.
You want to hear it?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.200
No, I've heard them before.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.984
They just sound like "b-ding!"

19:20.115 --> 19:23.771
You know what, why don't you
just read it?

19:23.901 --> 19:26.513
"Dear Moon Cow"?

19:26.643 --> 19:28.079
I couldn't think
of a cult name.No,

19:28.210 --> 19:29.864
that's actually really good.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.474
You're a total Moon Cow.

19:31.605 --> 19:34.912
"Dear Moon Cow.
Thank you so much

19:35.043 --> 19:37.524
"for reaching out.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.134
"All these years,
I thought my little sister

19:39.265 --> 19:41.005
"died hating me.

19:41.136 --> 19:45.662
"To learn that she didn't
fills me with a great peace.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.577
"She was the kindest person
I've ever met,

19:47.708 --> 19:49.579
"and I loved her so much.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.973
"I wish I had told her
more often in this world,

19:52.103 --> 19:56.020
"But maybe I'll get a chance
to in the next.

19:56.151 --> 20:00.242
Forever grateful, Rob."

20:00.373 --> 20:03.985
And that, my friend, is why
I still look at sunsets.

20:06.553 --> 20:07.815
Thanks, Moon Cow.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.860
That's groovy.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.820
That's really, really groovy.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.778
No, don'’t...

20:17.390 --> 20:19.957
And I'm stoned.
