Johnny Jaqobis,
lover of ships.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.060
Yala Yardeen, killer of men.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.667
KHL YE/V: Where did you get
the 6/7/70; Anee/a?

00:14.760 --> 00:16.102
Why does she look like you?

00:16.200 --> 00:17.701
A/VEEM:
She’s the me
[should have been.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.267
She's your good wolf, Papa.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.920
KHL YE/V: I put memories into the Green.
We can’t take them out.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.359
I can.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.897
I did it. Your whole life
In one tIny pIn.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.226
You will pay for everything.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.707
I remember you.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.267
Who is the Lady?

00:39.360 --> 00:42.067
The end of everything
ifshe gets out of the Green.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.469
Let's make a deal.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.983
We stop trying to kill each
other long enough to kill her.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.389
Dutch!

00:48.880 --> 00:49.949
I'm sorry.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.064
DUTCH”. Where are we?

00:51.160 --> 00:52.707
A/VEEM:
I call it
the Green Space.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.301
The space between
all the memories.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.379
How do we know where
to find the Lady in here?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.588
Let's go give her hell.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.947
You found her?
I think she found us.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.262
(GROANS)

01:44.360 --> 01:45.543
Be strong, Yalena.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.744
You be strong.
I'll be injured.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.348
ANEELA: What did
she do to her?

01:49.640 --> 01:50.857
I don't know yet.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.024
(PANTS)

01:52.640 --> 01:53.629
It hurts.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.267
I'm afraid I can't help
you with that.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.382
Go, keep watch.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.429
Hurry.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.267
How about a story?
Khlyen...

02:02.360 --> 02:03.384
A true story.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.784
A memory of yours
I need you to hold on to.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.986
Stop. A story can't
save my life.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.584
This one can,
if you listen to every word.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.300
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

02:18.920 --> 02:19.909
Good.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.143
When the nights were long
and the days were deep,

02:30.800 --> 02:32.347
there
hveg’
a warrior...

02:39.160 --> 02:42.300
And the thief who was
about to save her life.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.023
WOMAN: (OVER SPEAKER) Last
call for boarding. Q Cluster.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.439
Where's the ball?

02:56.960 --> 02:58.587
You cheated!
Best out of three?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.820
Whatever he owes you,
I'll cover it.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.185
How about a little insult_ tax
for thinking we're stupid?

03:04.520 --> 03:06.545
How about 50 Joy?

03:06.640 --> 03:08.141
Hey...
Not good enough.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.821
(0 VB? SPEAKER) Happy hour
in the Orbit Lounge.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.064
IfI lose my temper,
you lose your balls.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.079
Take it and go.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.704
Let's go.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.782
A/l ships arriving from the l/enn
Sector must proceed to /e ve/ 42

03:23.880 --> 03:25.222

03:25.920 --> 03:26.909
You Okay?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.262
Thought I was gonna have
to step in there...

03:28.720 --> 03:30.620
What were you thinking?
Ow!

03:30.880 --> 03:32.017
What were you thinking?

03:32.200 --> 03:34.623
That was our last 50 Joy.
I could've taken those guys.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.709
To what, dinner?

03:36.680 --> 03:39.706
Hey, I am a deceptively
athletic individual.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.018
You're wanted
in about 10 billion zones,

03:42.120 --> 03:45.021
and my people are probably still
hunting me for my husband's murder.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.180
We can't risk the attention.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.340
And we can't keep running from all
that with a dry tank and zero Joy.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.429
Look.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.706
You're a big, fancy royal lady.
You're used to a softer way of life.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.904
I get that. And this is
probably all beneath you.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.260
But good manners will not
fill your ship's tanks,

03:59.360 --> 04:00.861
and we are this close
to being out of fuel.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.177
I know.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.181
Look, while you've been grifting, I've
been handling it like a grown-up.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.464
How?
Got us a dayjob, Princess.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.659
A 10b? Ugh, gross.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.581
A hauling contract. Twenty-four
crates of beet wine.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.621
The pay should hold us
for a few weeks,

04:14.720 --> 04:16.779
and we can look for more
while we're there.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.342
(GROANS)

04:18.440 --> 04:19.702
So where are we headed?

04:19.800 --> 04:22.303
A place called the Quad.
Everbeen?

04:25.080 --> 04:26.399
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:42.400 --> 04:44.539
KHL YE/V: AH heroes need
a home to fight for.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.907

were about to meet theirs.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.862
They /o ved it Immediate/y

04:50.800 --> 04:52.620
You know, you never hear
anything exciting happening

04:52.720 --> 04:55.029
this end of the J.
You wanna know why?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.385
Because nothing exciting ever
happens this end of the J.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, noted again.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.906
Look, I'm not asking you
to love it.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.417
We get paid, we get fueled
and we get out.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.669
Promise.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.029
Snob.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.189
Ha!

05:09.400 --> 05:11.903
Okay, then, land us
at the intake coordinates.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.679
LUCY: Understood.
Approach/ng Wester/ey.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.540
Listen, ship...

05:25.120 --> 05:27.680
I know we got off on the wrong
foot, but this is getting weird.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.239
It's been months
smce I stole you.

05:29.320 --> 05:33.700
LUCY: Attempted to steal me.
You fa/ied. You are a fa/iure.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.142
Thanks, Mom.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.617
Again, I'm super sorry.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.269
Might you be so kind
as to open the door?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.306
LUCY: I’m watching you,
John Jaqobis,

05:48.320 --> 05:49.309
Not creepy at all.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.626
LUCY: Entering
Old Town airspace.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.020
MAN:
Perm/ss/on to
dock granted.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.600
Company authorities
require mandatory inspection.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.623
Submit documents
to Senior Ofﬁcer Oonan.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.901
All right, what do
we got here, then?

06:15.160 --> 06:19.859
24 crates of beet wine, signed,
sealed and nearly delivered.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.224
Import docs.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.458
I'm not sure what
the hells that's for,

06:24.680 --> 06:26.466
but it means shit-all here.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.183
This is a_closed zone.
Meaning what?

06:29.480 --> 06:33.985
Well, only two groups are
allowed to import to the Quad.

06:34.120 --> 06:38.625
The Company and Killjoys.
Everyone else is smuggling.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.749
That'd be you.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.919
Seize the cargo.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.023
Hey. Hey, you can't do that.

06:46.760 --> 06:51.424
Because underneath this gruff
exterior lies the heart of a puppy?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.426
No, because we took
this job in good faith,

06:53.520 --> 06:55.829
and we don't get paid
unless we deliver.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.059
Then I guess you better
pay the fine, son.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.904
10,000 Joy end of day,
no exceptions.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.026
Meanwhile, we impound
your ship.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.225
Have a nice day in Old Town.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.184
Try the sexers.
Avoid the pork.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.662
I hate this place.

07:18.320 --> 07:22.063
KHL YE/V: Trapped in a strange land
our heroes did what heroes do,

07:22.320 --> 07:25.300
and went in search
of answers and ale.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.305
So now we have _
no money and no ship.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.823
This trip of yours is going
great, by the way. A-plus.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.279
We didn't order anything yet.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.057
Oh, honey, your faces did
as
soon as you walked in that door.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.259
This round's on me.
Thank you.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.788
You really want
to feel better?

07:48.720 --> 07:51.359
Tell me your flavor, and I can
recommend some sexers upstairs.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.579
Are they hiring?
We could use the cash.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.147
Yeah, no, I'm kidding.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.623
Our loss.
Those baby blues!

08:00.720 --> 08:02.108
Ooh, mmm!

08:02.280 --> 08:03.542
You could never go hungry.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.782
(LAUGHS)

08:07.720 --> 08:10.280
Who the hells can raise
10,000 Joy in one day

08:10.360 --> 08:11.429
in a shit town like this?

08:11.720 --> 08:12.709
No one can.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.661
No one can.
It's gotta be a shakedown.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.739
I bet they pull this shit
on all the out-of-towners.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.427
They're probably just
looking for a bribe.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.663
With what money?

08:22.760 --> 08:25.467
You used the last of it to save
my spectacular ass on Laryon.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.462
Fine, we tried it my way.
Now we'll try it your way.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.383
Go and do your, you know,
gambit hustle thingy.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.146
Are you saying
that I'm an expert

08:35.240 --> 08:38.539
and that you might in fact
need said expertise?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.417
Sure.
Watch a master at work.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.703
(CLEARS THRO A r)

08:45.400 --> 08:46.424
Mmm.

So good to see ya.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.025
Oh! Sorry, buddy. Wrong guy.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.863
Hey, my friend's getting into a fight.
100 Joy says he wins.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.257
Blue eyes?

09:12.360 --> 09:13.679
Hey! Give me my wallet!

09:14.120 --> 09:15.109
Grab that guy!

09:15.920 --> 09:18.559
Three against one?
Yeah, I'll take that action.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.109
Johnny.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.543
(GROANS)

09:34.360 --> 09:36.737
Hey, look, I got this. I'm
just playing the long game.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.183
Yeah, well, your long game is
leading us to a very short death.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.384
(WHISTLES)

09:41.600 --> 09:44.660
All right, all right.
Everybody calm your shit.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.429
You, new guy, come with me.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.227
I don't think so.
Oh, no?

09:50.280 --> 09:51.542
You know what this is?

09:54.800 --> 09:58.065
What was that? What did you do?
I felt something.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.827
This is important.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.857
May I continue?

10:05.400 --> 10:08.221
The man held up his badge
to the warrior, and he said...

10:08.440 --> 10:11.580
You know what this is?
No, but I know what this is.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.143
(SCREAMS)

10:13.800 --> 10:16.018
I'd stay very still
if I were all of you!

10:16.440 --> 10:18.544
Lovely town.
Nice to meet y'all.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.068
Tip your bartender.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.639
I thought you said
no breaking the law.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.039
I said you shouldn't.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.860
You're no good at it.
I'm bloody amazing.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.019
Well, let's just agree that we're
better at grifts together.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.187
Hey, maybe we found our niche.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.819
We can go up and down the J,
never go hungry again.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.309
Here.

10:36.960 --> 10:37.984
Keep it.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.549
Why are you giving me
your cut?

10:39.800 --> 10:41.188
Because you'll need it
to get out of here,

10:41.280 --> 10:43.305
away from me.
What are you talking about?

10:43.400 --> 10:44.503
(GUN FIRES)

10:44.760 --> 10:49.060
Oh, hi there. It's me again.
I got an update for ya.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.188
You've been locked and served.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.269
She's found us.
It's spreading.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.060
What happens
when it reaches my heart?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.617
It's not the heart
that matters.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.706
When it reaches your mind,
she'll break through.

11:17.800 --> 11:18.903
She'll know everything.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.100
Whatever you're doing,
you better hurry.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.457
She'll be here soon.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.027
KHLYEN: Every battle has a
crisis that seems unwinnable,

11:27.600 --> 11:30.740
and the warrior
was about to face hers.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.943
Let me lead.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.600
I've been through this a million times
on a million different planets.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.660
Only you would brag about
multiple arrests, dingus.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.460
You must focus on
the details of the story.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.386
That's why it needs telling.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.261
It's a venous lie detector.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.469
Don't waste my time.

11:59.520 --> 12:04.457
Were you arrested today
with an unnamed adult female?

12:05.680 --> 12:09.628
Check, check. Testes, testes.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.063
Just answer.
Yes.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.543
(muss)

12:13.640 --> 12:15.585
What is the_ nature
of your relationship?

12:15.680 --> 12:16.942
Complicated.
(CONTINUES DINGING)

12:17.040 --> 12:19.019
Are you a couple?
No.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.863
Do you wish you were a couple?
What?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.424
Do you have sexual dreams about...
Whoa! Hey, now.

12:25.560 --> 12:29.109
I have rights. This is still a J colony.
You can't just keep us here.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.021
In what universe? She shot me,

12:32.680 --> 12:35.319
a RAC agent, in front of
a room full of witnesses.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.629
That's fake news.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.789
(BUZZES)

12:37.880 --> 12:39.700
Occupation?
Debutante...

12:40.720 --> 12:42.984
Space cowboy... Carrot.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.184
(DINGS)
So much for unbeatable tech.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.542
What are you running from?

12:48.600 --> 12:49.942
Who says I'm running?
Your partner.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.661
He told us everything
about you.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.705
Bullshit.
Because he wouldn't do that

12:53.800 --> 12:55.142
or because he doesn't
know everything?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.186
See, 'cause I'm pretty good
at reading people,

12:58.280 --> 13:02.740
and I peg you two being together
about, what, six months,

13:02.840 --> 13:03.977
a Year, tops?

13:04.320 --> 13:06.060
And you seem like
someone who works alone,

13:06.160 --> 13:08.583
so what are you
keeping him around for?

13:09.640 --> 13:11.380
Fall guy? Cover...

13:11.480 --> 13:13.107
He's my friend.
Nah.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.781
Betting you
don't have those.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.507
What are you doing in my Quad?

13:20.640 --> 13:21.709
Leaving.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.097
All right.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.983
I got a cold dinner
and a hot wife to get to.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.065
Come on. Let's go.
I'll take you to processing.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.389
MAN: Hold up.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.345
Hills put a courtesy
hold on these two.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.782
Wants you to bring them by
for questioning.

13:35.880 --> 13:36.949
About what?

13:37.040 --> 13:39.349
"Theft of property and crimes
against the Company."

13:39.520 --> 13:41.579
We've been _on this
stupid moon SIX hours.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.102
What the hells did we steal?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.345
No flaming idea.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.429
Here.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.663
Security cam footage
from three hours ago.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.387
Keep an eye on your crates.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.424
Killed the cams and six layers
of auto locks on the door.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.029
A very clever break-in,
by the way. Full marks.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.509
So what did you
take from here?

14:03.760 --> 14:07.105
Look, whatever your shitty new
Shakedown is, we're not playing.

14:07.240 --> 14:11.904
Crimes against the Company carry
15 years' labor, minimum.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.903
I just peed a little.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.463
Look, it can't be them. They
were with me three hours ago.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.580
Okay, so they're
not working alone.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.938
Oh, come on, Hills,
you got vapor here.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.701
Look, I got these two
dead to rights.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.900
Please do not screw up my processing
with your Company bullshit.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.945
HILLS: If it wasn't
for Company bullshit,

14:28.040 --> 14:30.827
you Killjoys would barely have
any work in the Quad.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.059
Hey! You didn't check
all the crates.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.741
Remote trigger EMP.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.259
You can detonate this
from a million miles away.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.429
So?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.101
So obviously somebody
used us as mules

14:41.200 --> 14:43.339
to get in your cage so they
could bust something else out.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.319
Which still means shit on toast to me
until you tell me what was stolen.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.937
DUTCH: Poison.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.427
Hallcyon, by the smell.
One touch is all it takes.

14:52.760 --> 14:56.821
It liquefies the pleural lining of
your lungs. You drown on dry land.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.141
Wow, you know an awful lot about gross
poisons for a debutante carrot.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.027
Girl's gotta have a hobby. It was
either this or pole dancing.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.303
(CHUCKLES)

15:06.120 --> 15:09.578
Look, Hills, you make me
arrest them for theft,

15:09.720 --> 15:11.984
now everyone's gonna know that
you lost the poison, right?

15:12.320 --> 15:15.539
Somebody gets killed, that shit comes
back on you like a goddamn boomerang.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.107
What's your offer, Killjoy?

15:18.360 --> 15:19.463
Leave them in my custody.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.899
Put out a big, fat warrant
for the missing goods.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.185
I'll claim the warrant, find the poison
and nobody knows the difference.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.784
And you collect
a shitload of cash.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.829
Well...

15:30.120 --> 15:32.179
How are you gonna
find the poison?

15:43.360 --> 15:45.942
Well, the drinks here
are delightful.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.304
Shut up. I'm thinking.
About?

15:48.520 --> 15:50.897
How to use you two to solve
this shit sandwich you've made.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.823
You do realize you have an
elite assassin in town, right?

15:54.920 --> 15:57.184
This is Westerley, kid.
We're not fancy.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.180
You can pay someone
half a pickle

15:59.280 --> 16:01.783
to knock off your husband
and still get back change.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.537
Okay, that import
was for custom seizures.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.709
Everything held in that lockup

16:05.800 --> 16:07.381
came from your Quad.
So?

16:07.480 --> 16:10.301
Well,
assassins
are very
particular about their weapons.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.589
They bring their own.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.068
So if the poison
came from the Quad,

16:13.200 --> 16:15.942
so did the killer, which means
the target is of high value.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.399
Johnny, why don't you go and get us
some more of those delightful drinks?

16:24.760 --> 16:25.897
Hey, give me a knife.

16:26.920 --> 16:27.909
Wanna rephrase?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.783
A tool, to help crack
this baby open.

16:30.880 --> 16:31.869
Mmm-hmm.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.827
Anything for you, blue eyes.
Thank you.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.899
Okay, so what makes you
such an expert

16:37.000 --> 16:39.104
on catching assassins?
lam an assassin.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.861
Bullshit. Prove it.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.221
You want_me to murder
you right here?

16:43.320 --> 16:45.459
I'd prefer you didn't,
thank you.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.140
What's your favorite way
to kill someone?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.061
Long pin through the ear.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.947
Pierces the brain,
looks like an aneurysm.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.177
Gross.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.740
What's the antidote
for Nylex poisoning?

16:57.840 --> 17:00.149
No such drug.
Where's your gun?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.705
Okay, enough.
You're creeping me out.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.187
You need me.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.466
It takes a pro to find one,
and you're not up for it.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.902
That's because you shot me.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.865
Because you're known here.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.981
Listen, I'm a nobody.
I can get to places you can't.

17:17.080 --> 17:20.823
I take the risk, you take the
reward and then you let us go.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.541
Look, everyone here saw you shoot me.
I can't let you skate on that.

17:29.000 --> 17:29.989
Okay-

17:31.840 --> 17:33.102
Just John, then.

17:33.720 --> 17:38.020
I do this for you, and Johnny
and our ship go free today.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.980
Okay, well, if I am in fact
talking to a master spy assassin,

17:45.080 --> 17:46.149
you know what this is.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.707
Soluble tracker.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.019
Normally I like to slip it into my
mark's drink without them knowing,

17:51.120 --> 17:53.338
'cause I'm a classy
bitch like that.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.909
Now, you fail, I find you,

17:58.840 --> 18:00.899
and you and your boy get
thrown into the kinda smaflhme

18:01.000 --> 18:02.661
people don't come back from.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.909
Deal?

18:10.640 --> 18:11.743
Deal.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.429
Johnny.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.347
I can't believe you got him
to cut us loose.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.759
That's some fast talking,
Queenie.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.820
Yeah, well, none of it means shit if we
don't come through with that poison.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.504
Ta-da! Now, this little bugger
works via remote relay trigger,

18:33.600 --> 18:35.864
and that trigger used
a specific frequency.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.348
Now, I reversed
that frequency,

18:37.440 --> 18:39.817
so instead of receiving the
signal, it's sending it back.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.182
So we can follow it?

18:41.520 --> 18:42.987
We have been following it.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.865
It's coming from
right in there.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.265
You really are great,
you know that?

18:48.360 --> 18:49.861
I've heard the rumors.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.747
(EXHALES)

18:54.680 --> 18:57.467
So, how do you wanna
play this?

18:59.600 --> 19:01.545
Killjoys! This is a raid!
Killjoys! Show me your hands!

19:01.640 --> 19:03.744
Don't move!
Don't move, you scumbags!

19:03.840 --> 19:05.387
Man...
Okay, all right.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.949
Where's your badge?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.183
Ooh!
Whoa, whoa!

19:12.280 --> 19:14.100
That's my badge.
You wanna see it again?

19:14.200 --> 19:15.519
No, man, we're good.
We're good.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.864
So...

19:17.960 --> 19:19.063
Who's responsible for this?

19:20.240 --> 19:22.140
Yeah, that's right,
I reversed the frequency.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.461
Where's the poison, Larry?

19:24.600 --> 19:27.342
It's Ian. Of course it is.
I hate this place.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.067
Look, I don't know
anything, okay?

19:29.160 --> 19:30.502
I was just hired to steal shit
from the impound

19:30.600 --> 19:32.659
and hand it off.
Come on.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.420
Clever guy like you? You must
know where I can find it.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.699
No.
Okay.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.986
You sure about that, Larry?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.263
Where'd you learn that?

19:43.360 --> 19:45.863
Princess self-defense classes.
It was a tough kingdom.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.100
Who's the target,
and where is he?

19:48.400 --> 19:50.459
All right, look, I know where the
hit is, but good luck getting in.

19:50.840 --> 19:51.829
Humor me.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.021
A Tenyer retreat on Qresh.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.586
Only the highest class
type get in.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.419
Ah. Not a problem.
I clean up good.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.184
You're super gonna
wanna ice that, Larry.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.269
It's Ian.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.384
Mmm-hmm.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.100
LUCY ’1 Oreshi marriage contracts
expire every .70 years.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.140
Tenyer, or ”JO-year, ” retreats

20:12.240 --> 20:15.266
are a ”safe, sane way
for married Individuals

20:15.400 --> 20:16.901
”to try different partners

20:17.000 --> 20:19.707
”before deciding whether
to renew their marriage. ”

20:20.120 --> 20:22.463
That's a very classy way
of saying "bang pass."

20:22.920 --> 20:25.627
Well, divorce is complicated
with lands and titles.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.782
You know, my people don't even allow it.
We're married until we die.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.745
Well, in my family,
we just stay married

20:30.840 --> 20:32.102
till we wish we were dead.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.982
Much more civilized.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.399
JothHed.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.107
Pardon?
The clemency deal.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.500
It isn't for both of us.
It's just for you.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.746
Look, I was the one who shot Joe. I
should be the one who pays for it.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.945
That's not how teams work.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.309
But we aren't a team.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.220
Bullshit. What are we?

20:52.200 --> 20:54.942
Look, it's been fun.
It really has. It...

20:55.040 --> 20:58.385
Okay, please, do not give me
the "it's been fun" speech.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.539
But we knew it had to end
eventually, right?

21:02.080 --> 21:03.217
What are you doing?

21:04.400 --> 21:05.389
Hey...

21:05.720 --> 21:07.938
People who get close to me
always get hurt.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.783
I'm not gonna do that to you.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.302
Then don't do this.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.389
Have to.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.224
Lucy, once we land on Qresh,
get him out of here.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.106
Leave the Quad, and don't come back.
Understood?

21:18.280 --> 21:19.668
LUCY ’1 Orders understood

21:21.520 --> 21:22.544
I'm sorry.

21:37.800 --> 21:42.499
The thief was many things. A teller
of tales, a molester of ships.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.744
Not good enough for either
of my daughters.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.742
I'm telling John.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.062
Well, whatever else
he may have been,

21:53.160 --> 21:54.582
a quitter he was not.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.667
LUCY: Warning. Attempting breach
wﬂl result in electroshock.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.502
You'd like that, Wouldn't ya?

22:01.600 --> 22:03.704
Been wanting to fry my ass
since we met.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.546
LUCY: You overest/mate
your value to me.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.742
Yeah? What about _her value?
Your captain.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.467
Don't your protocols make you
give a shit about her?

22:10.680 --> 22:14.559
LUCY: My directive is to follow her orders.
I am following her orders.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.464
Listen, if you're
gonna work with humans,

22:17.560 --> 22:19.107
you better get
this straight...

22:22.640 --> 22:26.019
They rarely say what they really mean
or ask for what they really need.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.868
LUCY ’1 That’s ineﬁ‘icient.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.746
Why do you think
I like machines so much?

22:32.240 --> 22:34.549
LUCY: You have damaged
my defense protocol.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.301
A few more minutes,
and I can rewrite

22:36.400 --> 22:38.960
your entire damn directive
so you have to obey my orders.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.699
But I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?

22:41.800 --> 22:44.109
Because I don't want
your obedience.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.185
I want your help.
With what?

22:46.440 --> 22:49.466
Saving your captain from herself.
Now, search your files.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.942
While I've been on this ship,

22:51.040 --> 22:53.224
have I ever done
anything to harm her?

22:53.320 --> 22:54.742
No.
And has she indicated

22:54.840 --> 22:56.307
anything other
than trust in me?

22:56.720 --> 22:58.779
No.
Then given those variables,

22:59.240 --> 23:01.617
you're gonna make
a decision right now.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.580
You know, if I was smart,

23:10.680 --> 23:12.989
I would just sell your ass
on the black market.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.584
All my troubles...
Pfft, gone.

John Jaqobis,

23:22.480 --> 23:25.620
Get your engines pumping,
girl. We got a queen to catch.

23:34.040 --> 23:37.020
Tenyering alone? Take it
this is your first time?

23:37.520 --> 23:40.102
We married young.
The bloodline needed a boost.

23:40.320 --> 23:43.266
Well, you're in for a treat.
Your selection bracelet.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.186

someone who interests you,

23:45.280 --> 23:47.100
simply point to the bezel
and click.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.266
How does the sex happen?

23:50.360 --> 23:51.782
If the interest is mutual,

23:51.880 --> 23:54.144
our system arranges
a discreet rendezvous.

23:54.240 --> 23:58.142
Like a nightly dance card
but for the sex?

23:58.240 --> 24:02.779
(CHUCKLES) Well, it's been 10 years, right?
Why not dance while you can?

24:03.520 --> 24:05.147

idenfificafionlogged,

24:05.240 --> 24:06.502

your retreat.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.703

24:10.320 --> 24:11.389
Sure.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.679
Sweetheart, did you forget
your credentials again?

24:17.320 --> 24:19.424

separate suites.

Happy Tenyer, you two.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.547
I hate you.
Me?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.426
Why the hell are you
following me?

24:35.520 --> 24:37.704
We've been here five minutes.
I already saved your ass.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.069
You need me.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.225
No, you just need
to feel needed.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.459
Obviously. Still rude to say.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.320
Fine. But once we're
done here, we're done.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.501
I have a plan.
How?

24:48.600 --> 24:50.022
We don't know the target
or the killer.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.223
Yeah, but we know the method.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.861
I had to find something fast.
You don't like it?

25:01.440 --> 25:03.101
You don't like it.
No, it's fine.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.020
You look fine.

God, you are the worst wife ever.
I already wanna fake-divorce you.

25:08.920 --> 25:09.989
Fine by me.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.707
This gives a whole new
meaning to "cocktail party."

as far as kinky vacations go.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.309
This is about more than sex.
They can get that anywhere.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.383
They probably don't even consider
sleeping with the lower classes cheating.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.225
Well, if it's not about sex,
then what is it about?

25:42.880 --> 25:44.984
Deciding whether to stay
with the partner you have

25:45.080 --> 25:46.866
or risk it with someone new.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.781
JOHN: Try before you buy.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.383
So what's your genius plan, if
I'm apparently so shit at them?

25:58.280 --> 26:00.589
The killer will be faking
their identity like we are.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.466
Okay, we can hack
that totem system,

26:02.600 --> 26:06.058

But it won't happen here.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.501
They need to go
somewhere private

26:08.600 --> 26:09.919

I ’m betting he’s the target.

from matching him

Here's your cut.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.818
Should be enough to get you
wherever you need to go next.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.897
What about my charges?

36:26.120 --> 36:28.338
Hey, kid, why don't you
go grab yourself a soda?

36:28.440 --> 36:30.226
I'm a man, you know?

36:30.320 --> 36:32.743
(GRUNTS)
Grown-ass man.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.060
Listen, I used to know
someone like you,

36:40.160 --> 36:41.297
in your line of work.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.867
It's not good.

36:43.600 --> 36:46.342
It's not good for the soul.
What, are you my savior now?

36:46.440 --> 36:48.817
Sure, why not?
You got a better offer?

36:49.960 --> 36:51.985
Listen, you and your partner
can haul ass out of my Quad

36:52.080 --> 36:53.661
and never come back.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.623
I'm fine with that.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.341
Or...
Or?

36:59.800 --> 37:01.745
You know what the best thing
about that badge is?

37:01.840 --> 37:03.740
Abusing it to make
people obey you?

37:03.840 --> 37:06.741
It simplifies things.
Rules, warrants.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.786
Everything's clean and legal.

37:09.280 --> 37:13.421
I don't know, I just figured you
might be someone who might like

37:13.520 --> 37:15.260
something secure like that.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.799
Standing offer.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.139
TURIN: The lnterstellar's
all over my ass on this.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.703
So, hotshot, you recruit her?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.388
JOHN: Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

37:55.200 --> 37:57.145
Yeah. "Hello, stranger.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.583
"Thank you for rescuing me
from my tortured life

37:59.680 --> 38:01.022
"and being my only friend.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.299
"And did I mention
that I'm a mass murderer?

38:03.440 --> 38:05.180
"Anyway, where
shall we go next?"

38:07.960 --> 38:10.303
I mean, your elevator pitch
needs work, but...

38:11.280 --> 38:12.702
(CHUCKLES DRYLY)

38:13.120 --> 38:14.860
I don't know how
to be a good person.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.662
How do you tell someone that?

38:17.760 --> 38:19.819
Doesn't matter, 'cause
I wouldn't have believed you.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.422
She was wrong, you know.
People change.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.420
Everything changes.
That's natural law.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.707
Liquids become gases.
Bodies become soil.

38:33.800 --> 38:37.099
Trained killers become healthy,
well-adjusted citizens?

38:38.760 --> 38:39.977
Not by running.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.702
What if this time, we stayed?

38:48.520 --> 38:50.226
We went straight,
we joined the RAC?

38:50.320 --> 38:52.504
I mean, I would look great
in a uniform.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.504
But what if I'm
no good at normal?

39:04.880 --> 39:07.383
Well, then, Yalena Yardeen,

39:07.480 --> 39:09.505
I would like
to formally propose

39:10.600 --> 39:11.737
a Killjoys Tooyer.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.580
What?

39:13.760 --> 39:16.399
Give me your finger. Come on.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.942
I think you will like the shit
out of normal, but if not,

39:23.280 --> 39:25.987
in two years, we renew our
partnership or renege.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.537
No blame, no tears.

39:31.840 --> 39:32.864
Okay?

39:34.600 --> 39:35.589
Okay-

39:36.920 --> 39:38.239
Well, all right, then.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.459
Let's go toast
and make it official, Queenie!

39:40.600 --> 39:42.864
Hey, you can't
call me that anymore.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.458
We're starting over, remember?
New life, new identity?

39:46.040 --> 39:47.064
Fine.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.057
Duchess.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.777
Hey, that's a demotion!
I'm well aware.

39:59.480 --> 40:00.617
Duchess.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.457
DUTCH: You lied, you know.

40:14.760 --> 40:17.342
You said the thief saved
my life, but he didn't.

40:18.320 --> 40:20.538
I saved his.
You saved each other.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.627
That's what you need
to remember.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.817
You always save each other.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.860
What did he save her from?

40:30.120 --> 40:31.109
Me.

40:35.480 --> 40:36.469
Aneela?

40:38.240 --> 40:39.946
I'm not the only one
who needs you.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.461
Go.
In a moment. This first.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.759
Tell me the real lesson.

40:47.480 --> 40:51.507
That John's a cheelq asshole,
that I run too much.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.666
Fine, what's the lesson?

40:58.200 --> 40:59.337
When you are lost,

41:00.560 --> 41:02.027
when you are breaking,

41:02.120 --> 41:04.259
when you have no strength
left to fight her,

41:05.880 --> 41:07.347
find John Jaqobis.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.427
He is your true north,
your only way home.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.583
Do you understand?

41:15.640 --> 41:17.028
I need you to be brave.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.742
Are you angry with me?

41:30.120 --> 41:32.065
I should never have
brought her to you as a child.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.741
I thought you were gonna
take care of her.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.702
If we don't do something soon,
the Lady will break her.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.064
She was always going
to break her, Neely.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.219
The only thing we can
control is when.

41:43.680 --> 41:44.817
What did you do?

41:48.960 --> 41:50.382
I hid something.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.017
Where is she going?

41:53.120 --> 41:56.066
KHL YE/V: To face the Lady, wh/le
she st/l/ has a chance to win.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.065
A/VL-‘L-‘LA: Win how?
She’s alone out there.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.542
KHL YE/V: Not if she listened.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.187
The rest is up to her.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.429
Okay-

42:09.280 --> 42:10.941
You want me, you bitch?

42:12.480 --> 42:13.947
Come and get me!

42:15.120 --> 42:16.587
(GASPS)

42:28.480 --> 42:30.857
DUTCH: A story can ’t sa ve
my life, Khlyen.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.902
KHL YE/V: This one can.
It can save all of us.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.097
It’s the story of a lo ve/y,
lone/y warrior,

42:37.720 --> 42:40.780
and the thief
who is about to save us all.
