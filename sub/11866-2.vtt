00:34.326 --> 00:36.817
about the tragic events
that have brought us here.

00:37.913 --> 00:42.202
The loss of
Walter and Susan Perkins

00:42.251 --> 00:45.243
forces us to question
if the work we do

00:45.879 --> 00:47.665
is worth the risks.

from the idealistic vision

00:51.260 --> 00:53.216
that by advancing science,

00:53.345 --> 00:56.007
we can control it
for the greater good.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.298
Clearly,
that's not always the case.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.686
We can never forget
Walter and Susan.

you will be greatly missed.

I still don't get it.

My daughter Zoe said
pretty much
the same thing to me

02:19.723 --> 02:22.681
when I told her l was
being transferred to Eureka.

02:22.768 --> 02:26.056

my only chance
of getting my stuff back

take a crank call

that they had a grandson
who needs a home.

a big surprise to me,

Yeah, do you mind
if I ask you
how you and Walter met?

06:27.762 --> 06:31.721
l was a grad student at MIT.
He was a post-doc.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.433
We got married
right after graduation,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.728
and he wanted
to start a family,

06:39.524 --> 06:40.934

this guy came to the door

06:43.862 --> 06:47.320

to talk to Walter
about some top-secret job.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.232
He wanted to go,
I wanted to stay.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.193

gonna have to verify that

sort this thing out.

to confirm your identity.

better than that.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.918
Good safety tip.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.099
Fargo, what do you want?
It's 10:30 at night.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.556
Actually,
I'm here to help you.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.561
I heard you were looking
for a place to stay,

15:41.607 --> 15:44.064
and I'm involved in

15:44.569 --> 15:47.436
a little project that
I think you may find
interesting.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.736
Really?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.114
What kind of project?

15:55.621 --> 15:56.781
Almost there.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.947
Can I open my eyes yet?
Okay.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.294
Behold.

Oh, come on, Sheriff.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.495
Just take a look.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.994
I know she's not much
from the outside,
but I promise,

16:39.040 --> 16:41.622
once you get
to know SARAH,
you'll love her.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.867
Who's Sarah?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.160
SARAH, open door.

SARAH for short.

Fargo?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.208
Is that you
talking like a girl?

17:26.629 --> 17:29.211
No, it's the Smart House.

it'll take some time

17:36.556 --> 17:38.888
to learn all of
your personal preferences.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.264
Well,
my preference right now

17:40.351 --> 17:42.387
is to have a house
that isn't radioactive.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.094
(SNICKERS)
Well, it used to be
a nuclear disaster bunker.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.601

Stem cell replication.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.005
Are you saying that
Walter cloned his wife?

24:37.101 --> 24:40.309
Not exactly. Walter
went way beyond cloning.

He recreated Susan

wanna say anything with

to keep between us?

I saw something.

has to go somewhere.
